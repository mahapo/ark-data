00:00:09.620 --> 00:00:11.810 align:middle line:84%
>>MARLENE SEVEN BREMNER:
These different forces,

00:00:11.810 --> 00:00:13.910 align:middle line:84%
as we see in a
hermetic worldview,

00:00:13.910 --> 00:00:15.930 align:middle line:84%
they're associated
with the planets.

00:00:15.930 --> 00:00:18.290 align:middle line:90%
They work upon us unconsciously.

00:00:18.290 --> 00:00:21.590 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA MEREDITH: These
aren't masses of rocks moving

00:00:21.590 --> 00:00:23.100 align:middle line:90%
through the solar system.

00:00:23.100 --> 00:00:26.828 align:middle line:84%
They have conscious intelligence
just as Gaia Earth has herself.

00:00:26.828 --> 00:00:28.370 align:middle line:84%
>>BREMNER: The more
conscious that we

00:00:28.370 --> 00:00:32.689 align:middle line:84%
can become of these influences
and form a relationship

00:00:32.689 --> 00:00:35.960 align:middle line:84%
to these archetypal energies
that the planets represent,

00:00:35.960 --> 00:00:40.010 align:middle line:84%
the more agency and control
we have over our own destiny.

00:00:40.010 --> 00:00:44.180 align:middle line:84%
I began to just apply some
of these different ideas

00:00:44.180 --> 00:00:45.800 align:middle line:90%
into my creative practice.

00:00:45.800 --> 00:00:49.250 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: What you did is so
powerful and beautiful because

00:00:49.250 --> 00:00:51.680 align:middle line:84%
it gives the representation
for the rest of us

00:00:51.680 --> 00:00:54.320 align:middle line:90%
to be able to see visually.

00:00:54.320 --> 00:00:57.800 align:middle line:84%
>>BREMNER: We can
slowly begin to purify,

00:00:57.800 --> 00:01:01.182 align:middle line:84%
in an alchemical sense, the
contents of our own inner world

00:01:01.182 --> 00:01:02.390 align:middle line:90%
and the contents of our mind.

00:01:02.390 --> 00:01:06.185 align:middle line:90%


00:01:06.185 --> 00:01:08.560 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Many of you have
heard of the word "hermetics,"

00:01:08.560 --> 00:01:10.690 align:middle line:90%
but it remains a lofty concept.

00:01:10.690 --> 00:01:13.900 align:middle line:10%
Marlene Seven Bremner
has taken it upon herself

00:01:13.900 --> 00:01:18.010 align:middle line:10%
to articulate these texts into
one beautiful volume of work

00:01:18.010 --> 00:01:20.470 align:middle line:10%
driven by artistic
renditions of what

00:01:20.470 --> 00:01:23.020 align:middle line:10%
came from her dark
night of the soul.

00:01:23.020 --> 00:01:24.040 align:middle line:90%
Welcome.

00:01:24.040 --> 00:01:25.810 align:middle line:84%
You've done such
beautiful work here,

00:01:25.810 --> 00:01:28.090 align:middle line:84%
and there's a tremendous
amount of depth to it.

00:01:28.090 --> 00:01:28.450 align:middle line:90%
>>BREMNER: Thank you, Regina.

00:01:28.450 --> 00:01:29.650 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And really,
it's like if someone

00:01:29.650 --> 00:01:31.900 align:middle line:84%
wants to take hermetics
on, I can't think

00:01:31.900 --> 00:01:35.740 align:middle line:84%
of a more wonderful place
than-- the standard on Amazon,

00:01:35.740 --> 00:01:38.260 align:middle line:84%
"Corpus Hermeticum,"
anybody can do that.

00:01:38.260 --> 00:01:39.910 align:middle line:90%
But I love your book.

00:01:39.910 --> 00:01:41.800 align:middle line:90%
This is beautiful.

00:01:41.800 --> 00:01:43.360 align:middle line:84%
I would like to
first start out--

00:01:43.360 --> 00:01:46.120 align:middle line:84%
because you appear
to be quite young.

00:01:46.120 --> 00:01:49.240 align:middle line:84%
And clearly, you got
on your path early.

00:01:49.240 --> 00:01:51.880 align:middle line:84%
You lived around the
world, military dad.

00:01:51.880 --> 00:01:54.580 align:middle line:84%
But some of it-- let's talk
a little bit about your time

00:01:54.580 --> 00:01:56.140 align:middle line:84%
in Germany and
what happened later

00:01:56.140 --> 00:01:58.900 align:middle line:84%
in life that really caused you
to go through what I mentioned

00:01:58.900 --> 00:02:01.030 align:middle line:84%
earlier, kind of a
dark night of the soul,

00:02:01.030 --> 00:02:02.720 align:middle line:84%
so people can get
to know you a bit.

00:02:02.720 --> 00:02:03.520 align:middle line:90%
>>BREMNER: Yeah.

00:02:03.520 --> 00:02:05.950 align:middle line:84%
Well, I was born in Germany
but didn't live there long.

00:02:05.950 --> 00:02:07.480 align:middle line:10%
We left when I was about four.

00:02:07.480 --> 00:02:11.470 align:middle line:10%
But I think it was a pretty
formative experience growing up

00:02:11.470 --> 00:02:12.430 align:middle line:10%
those four years.

00:02:12.430 --> 00:02:14.990 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: That imprint of
your being, being born there.

00:02:14.990 --> 00:02:15.790 align:middle line:90%
>>BREMNER: Yeah.

00:02:15.790 --> 00:02:17.650 align:middle line:10%
And Frankfurt, where
I was born, was also

00:02:17.650 --> 00:02:22.840 align:middle line:10%
a very important alchemical
city after the Renaissance.

00:02:22.840 --> 00:02:25.750 align:middle line:10%
And a lot of really important
books were published there.

00:02:25.750 --> 00:02:28.750 align:middle line:10%
So it feels
significant that that's

00:02:28.750 --> 00:02:30.490 align:middle line:10%
where I came into the world.

00:02:30.490 --> 00:02:31.780 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Born on that dirt.

00:02:31.780 --> 00:02:34.030 align:middle line:90%
>>BREMNER: Yeah.

00:02:34.030 --> 00:02:37.300 align:middle line:84%
But yeah, I grew
up in a household

00:02:37.300 --> 00:02:43.550 align:middle line:84%
with a very artistic mother
and a very scientific atheist

00:02:43.550 --> 00:02:44.350 align:middle line:90%
father.

00:02:44.350 --> 00:02:46.510 align:middle line:84%
And we didn't grow
up with religion

00:02:46.510 --> 00:02:48.830 align:middle line:84%
because they'd both rejected
it in their own ways.

00:02:48.830 --> 00:02:50.830 align:middle line:84%
But my mom was quite
the spiritualist.

00:02:50.830 --> 00:02:54.070 align:middle line:84%
So there was a lot of that
influence for me growing up

00:02:54.070 --> 00:02:58.240 align:middle line:84%
and felt very connected
with nature as a child

00:02:58.240 --> 00:03:03.650 align:middle line:84%
and interested in the polarities
from a young age interestingly.

00:03:03.650 --> 00:03:04.450 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:03:04.450 --> 00:03:06.850 align:middle line:84%
That would lead you
right toward hermetics

00:03:06.850 --> 00:03:07.960 align:middle line:90%
at one point or another.

00:03:07.960 --> 00:03:09.010 align:middle line:90%
It was inevitable.

00:03:09.010 --> 00:03:11.950 align:middle line:84%
But what was it,
and on what level

00:03:11.950 --> 00:03:15.280 align:middle line:84%
were you interested in
polarity as a very young girl?

00:03:15.280 --> 00:03:18.370 align:middle line:84%
>>BREMNER: Well, just the
very basic relationship

00:03:18.370 --> 00:03:20.230 align:middle line:90%
between the sun and the moon.

00:03:20.230 --> 00:03:22.780 align:middle line:84%
This would feature in
my artwork quite often.

00:03:22.780 --> 00:03:25.990 align:middle line:84%
And as I got older, the
union of the opposites

00:03:25.990 --> 00:03:28.930 align:middle line:84%
just seemed like an
important concept.

00:03:28.930 --> 00:03:33.100 align:middle line:84%
And I don't know
why that came to me.

00:03:33.100 --> 00:03:36.830 align:middle line:84%
But it was an unconscious
thing going on at that point.

00:03:36.830 --> 00:03:41.500 align:middle line:84%
And as I developed and studied
different spiritual traditions

00:03:41.500 --> 00:03:43.720 align:middle line:84%
and different
healing modalities,

00:03:43.720 --> 00:03:47.650 align:middle line:84%
I eventually came to
find polarity therapy.

00:03:47.650 --> 00:03:50.810 align:middle line:84%
And I was living in Olympia,
and I found a teacher there.

00:03:50.810 --> 00:03:52.060 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Olympia, Washington?

00:03:52.060 --> 00:03:52.860 align:middle line:90%
>>BREMNER: Mm-hmm.

00:03:52.860 --> 00:03:54.850 align:middle line:84%
And started studying
and practicing

00:03:54.850 --> 00:03:57.670 align:middle line:84%
polarity therapy,
which is largely

00:03:57.670 --> 00:04:02.590 align:middle line:84%
based in hermetic principles
and these ideas of the elements

00:04:02.590 --> 00:04:06.250 align:middle line:84%
forming the human body and
the energy of the caduceus

00:04:06.250 --> 00:04:08.770 align:middle line:90%
and the chakras and--

00:04:08.770 --> 00:04:13.150 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Complementary
types of coming together

00:04:13.150 --> 00:04:15.890 align:middle line:90%
for alchemical transformation.

00:04:15.890 --> 00:04:16.690 align:middle line:90%
>>BREMNER: Yeah.

00:04:16.690 --> 00:04:21.190 align:middle line:84%
And essentially, helping people
to return to their connection

00:04:21.190 --> 00:04:25.390 align:middle line:84%
with source and to find the
balance between the polarities

00:04:25.390 --> 00:04:28.447 align:middle line:84%
rather than being pulled
by attraction and repulsion

00:04:28.447 --> 00:04:29.530 align:middle line:90%
back and forth between us.

00:04:29.530 --> 00:04:30.860 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Forever till we die?

00:04:30.860 --> 00:04:31.660 align:middle line:90%
>>BREMNER: Exactly.

00:04:31.660 --> 00:04:33.280 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:04:33.280 --> 00:04:35.650 align:middle line:84%
So that was my
introduction to hermetics.

00:04:35.650 --> 00:04:40.240 align:middle line:84%
And it was during the time that
I was still studying polarity

00:04:40.240 --> 00:04:42.400 align:middle line:84%
that I was also
introduced to alchemy.

00:04:42.400 --> 00:04:45.700 align:middle line:84%
And as you mentioned, I went
through a very dark night

00:04:45.700 --> 00:04:47.110 align:middle line:90%
of the soul.

00:04:47.110 --> 00:04:50.800 align:middle line:84%
Things were just thrown
upside down for me overnight.

00:04:50.800 --> 00:04:56.060 align:middle line:84%
And I didn't know how
to help myself anymore.

00:04:56.060 --> 00:04:57.550 align:middle line:84%
Even though I had
all these tools

00:04:57.550 --> 00:04:59.830 align:middle line:84%
and I was going to school
for energy medicine

00:04:59.830 --> 00:05:03.400 align:middle line:84%
and had all this wonderful
healing energy around me--

00:05:03.400 --> 00:05:05.620 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: It was like an
emotional shock, trauma?

00:05:05.620 --> 00:05:06.490 align:middle line:90%
>>BREMNER: Yeah.

00:05:06.490 --> 00:05:08.740 align:middle line:84%
Yeah, it was an emotional
shock and a trauma

00:05:08.740 --> 00:05:12.400 align:middle line:84%
and felt like my entire
nervous system had been

00:05:12.400 --> 00:05:14.860 align:middle line:90%
rerouted basically overnight.

00:05:14.860 --> 00:05:18.340 align:middle line:84%
And so all of the things that
used to help me self-regulate

00:05:18.340 --> 00:05:19.510 align:middle line:90%
no longer helped.

00:05:19.510 --> 00:05:22.420 align:middle line:84%
So I had to find a
different way through this

00:05:22.420 --> 00:05:25.540 align:middle line:84%
because going on long
walks, meditation, going

00:05:25.540 --> 00:05:28.480 align:middle line:84%
to yoga classes, all these
things that had been helpful

00:05:28.480 --> 00:05:31.640 align:middle line:84%
would actually trigger
panic and anxiety.

00:05:31.640 --> 00:05:33.550 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: This
whole notion of what

00:05:33.550 --> 00:05:35.740 align:middle line:84%
happens when you go
into an emotional shock

00:05:35.740 --> 00:05:38.560 align:middle line:84%
and the way it affects the
nervous system and then the way

00:05:38.560 --> 00:05:40.120 align:middle line:84%
the nervous system
in turn starts

00:05:40.120 --> 00:05:42.700 align:middle line:84%
imprinting the subconscious
mind and starts

00:05:42.700 --> 00:05:43.900 align:middle line:90%
creating these patterns.

00:05:43.900 --> 00:05:47.590 align:middle line:84%
And it really can become very
illogical, like you said.

00:05:47.590 --> 00:05:49.870 align:middle line:84%
Things that used to
make you feel good,

00:05:49.870 --> 00:05:53.060 align:middle line:90%
you try to move through that.

00:05:53.060 --> 00:05:55.550 align:middle line:84%
And like you said, you start
to feel panic-stricken.

00:05:55.550 --> 00:05:57.880 align:middle line:84%
It's like, how has this
been turned upside down?

00:05:57.880 --> 00:05:59.530 align:middle line:84%
And we'll talk about
that in a moment.

00:05:59.530 --> 00:06:01.400 align:middle line:90%
Continue with your experience.

00:06:01.400 --> 00:06:02.200 align:middle line:90%
>>BREMNER: Yeah.

00:06:02.200 --> 00:06:05.590 align:middle line:84%
So at the time, I
was just coming back

00:06:05.590 --> 00:06:07.540 align:middle line:90%
into my artistic practice.

00:06:07.540 --> 00:06:09.730 align:middle line:84%
I'd given it up for a
long time, went to school,

00:06:09.730 --> 00:06:11.410 align:middle line:84%
and was studying
energy medicine.

00:06:11.410 --> 00:06:13.840 align:middle line:84%
But I decided that I
wanted to start painting.

00:06:13.840 --> 00:06:17.320 align:middle line:84%
So I started to teach
myself how to oil-paint.

00:06:17.320 --> 00:06:19.510 align:middle line:84%
And specifically,
I didn't want to be

00:06:19.510 --> 00:06:23.530 align:middle line:84%
influenced by too many
other artists and stuff.

00:06:23.530 --> 00:06:24.910 align:middle line:90%
So I made a point to not--

00:06:24.910 --> 00:06:25.360 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Good for you.

00:06:25.360 --> 00:06:26.735 align:middle line:84%
>>BREMNER: --look
at a lot of art

00:06:26.735 --> 00:06:29.500 align:middle line:84%
and to not take lessons but
to just learn the basics.

00:06:29.500 --> 00:06:32.950 align:middle line:84%
And from there, everything
else was trial and error.

00:06:32.950 --> 00:06:36.460 align:middle line:84%
And I was also deeply
immersed in my initial studies

00:06:36.460 --> 00:06:37.540 align:middle line:90%
of alchemy.

00:06:37.540 --> 00:06:40.000 align:middle line:84%
And this was through
the lens of Carl Jung,

00:06:40.000 --> 00:06:42.100 align:middle line:84%
so a very psychological
perspective

00:06:42.100 --> 00:06:43.630 align:middle line:90%
on the alchemical art.

00:06:43.630 --> 00:06:48.220 align:middle line:84%
And I began to just apply
some of these different ideas

00:06:48.220 --> 00:06:49.960 align:middle line:90%
into my creative practice.

00:06:49.960 --> 00:06:51.880 align:middle line:84%
And it was through
that that I was

00:06:51.880 --> 00:06:56.410 align:middle line:84%
able to take these dark
things that I was experiencing

00:06:56.410 --> 00:06:59.800 align:middle line:84%
and transform them and
able to take things

00:06:59.800 --> 00:07:02.620 align:middle line:84%
from my own unconscious,
express them outwardly

00:07:02.620 --> 00:07:04.930 align:middle line:90%
in this spontaneous way.

00:07:04.930 --> 00:07:09.040 align:middle line:84%
And then a dialogue began to
unfold between me and my work

00:07:09.040 --> 00:07:12.280 align:middle line:84%
and between the paintings
and my inner world.

00:07:12.280 --> 00:07:16.270 align:middle line:84%
And it was a very healing
transformative process.

00:07:16.270 --> 00:07:18.310 align:middle line:84%
And, for me, this was
a very difficult time,

00:07:18.310 --> 00:07:21.040 align:middle line:84%
and it took several
years to get through.

00:07:21.040 --> 00:07:25.060 align:middle line:84%
But by the end of it, I
had completely changed.

00:07:25.060 --> 00:07:28.052 align:middle line:84%
I'd become a much more grounded,
integrated person because--

00:07:28.052 --> 00:07:30.010 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And you had an
offering for the world

00:07:30.010 --> 00:07:33.550 align:middle line:84%
through the alchemy of your
own experience and work

00:07:33.550 --> 00:07:34.870 align:middle line:90%
transformed into art.

00:07:34.870 --> 00:07:36.740 align:middle line:90%
I mean, really amazing art.

00:07:36.740 --> 00:07:37.540 align:middle line:90%
>>BREMNER: Yeah.

00:07:37.540 --> 00:07:39.332 align:middle line:84%
So everything that I've
written in the book

00:07:39.332 --> 00:07:42.400 align:middle line:84%
is really based in that
experiential knowledge

00:07:42.400 --> 00:07:43.870 align:middle line:84%
that I gained
through that process

00:07:43.870 --> 00:07:45.870 align:middle line:84%
and through going through
these different phases

00:07:45.870 --> 00:07:49.480 align:middle line:84%
of transmutation, going into the
dark night of the soul, which,

00:07:49.480 --> 00:07:51.580 align:middle line:84%
in alchemy, is
called the nigredo.

00:07:51.580 --> 00:07:54.700 align:middle line:10%
And it's associated with
death and with the color black

00:07:54.700 --> 00:07:56.200 align:middle line:10%
and with the planet Saturn.

00:07:56.200 --> 00:08:00.250 align:middle line:84%
And so these very heavy
Saturnian energies

00:08:00.250 --> 00:08:01.750 align:middle line:90%
also with the metal lead.

00:08:01.750 --> 00:08:05.950 align:middle line:84%
And it's this process of
going inward and confronting

00:08:05.950 --> 00:08:09.400 align:middle line:84%
the darkness within ourselves
but also acknowledging

00:08:09.400 --> 00:08:11.020 align:middle line:90%
it and integrating it.

00:08:11.020 --> 00:08:14.620 align:middle line:84%
So we don't just see our shadow
and push it away and reject it.

00:08:14.620 --> 00:08:15.880 align:middle line:90%
We integrate it.

00:08:15.880 --> 00:08:20.350 align:middle line:84%
And it becomes a part of us in
a power that then we can hold.

00:08:20.350 --> 00:08:23.530 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Well, the darkness
and the pain informs.

00:08:23.530 --> 00:08:26.200 align:middle line:84%
It tells us what has yet to be
healed, what's out of balance,

00:08:26.200 --> 00:08:26.530 align:middle line:90%
right?

00:08:26.530 --> 00:08:27.330 align:middle line:90%
>>BREMNER: Yeah.

00:08:27.330 --> 00:08:30.280 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And so pushing those
feelings and emotions away

00:08:30.280 --> 00:08:33.880 align:middle line:90%
is, I find, very detrimental.

00:08:33.880 --> 00:08:35.372 align:middle line:90%
It'll find you.

00:08:35.372 --> 00:08:37.080 align:middle line:84%
It will come find you
one way or another.

00:08:37.080 --> 00:08:39.690 align:middle line:84%
It might take-- it might decide
it needs to settle somewhere

00:08:39.690 --> 00:08:40.500 align:middle line:90%
in the body.

00:08:40.500 --> 00:08:41.490 align:middle line:90%
>>BREMNER: Oh, yeah.

00:08:41.490 --> 00:08:43.980 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: It'd come maybe
haunt you in the next lifetime.

00:08:43.980 --> 00:08:46.030 align:middle line:90%
But you can't get away from it.

00:08:46.030 --> 00:08:49.770 align:middle line:84%
So what you did is so powerful
and beautiful because it

00:08:49.770 --> 00:08:52.020 align:middle line:84%
gives the representation
for the rest of us

00:08:52.020 --> 00:08:54.540 align:middle line:90%
to be able to see visually.

00:08:54.540 --> 00:08:59.700 align:middle line:84%
For me, it's a process of like
a child feel everything, get it

00:08:59.700 --> 00:09:01.680 align:middle line:84%
out, just feel
everything in the moment,

00:09:01.680 --> 00:09:03.540 align:middle line:84%
and let it pass
where you're crying,

00:09:03.540 --> 00:09:05.040 align:middle line:84%
and then you're
laughing, however

00:09:05.040 --> 00:09:08.310 align:middle line:84%
long you need to so that it
literally can be released.

00:09:08.310 --> 00:09:10.890 align:middle line:84%
But you've taken it
a step far further,

00:09:10.890 --> 00:09:13.140 align:middle line:84%
which I think is why you
have all these amazing beings

00:09:13.140 --> 00:09:13.940 align:middle line:90%
around you.

00:09:13.940 --> 00:09:16.420 align:middle line:84%
You came here to
do important work.

00:09:16.420 --> 00:09:19.740 align:middle line:84%
So let's talk about a little bit
because a lot of people right

00:09:19.740 --> 00:09:20.770 align:middle line:90%
now--

00:09:20.770 --> 00:09:22.440 align:middle line:84%
a lot of people are
suffering right now.

00:09:22.440 --> 00:09:23.250 align:middle line:90%
They're in anger.

00:09:23.250 --> 00:09:24.050 align:middle line:90%
They're in angst.

00:09:24.050 --> 00:09:25.170 align:middle line:90%
They're in confusion.

00:09:25.170 --> 00:09:28.410 align:middle line:84%
It's like-- because we are
going through a transformative

00:09:28.410 --> 00:09:30.060 align:middle line:90%
process as a species.

00:09:30.060 --> 00:09:32.880 align:middle line:84%
And we're trying to punch our
way out of a paper bag a lot

00:09:32.880 --> 00:09:33.970 align:middle line:90%
of times.

00:09:33.970 --> 00:09:38.190 align:middle line:84%
So let's talk about what you
mentioned a little bit ago.

00:09:38.190 --> 00:09:41.220 align:middle line:84%
You had this
experience that started

00:09:41.220 --> 00:09:43.330 align:middle line:90%
trashing your nervous system.

00:09:43.330 --> 00:09:45.720 align:middle line:84%
So let's talk about
looking at it in the-- you

00:09:45.720 --> 00:09:49.680 align:middle line:84%
can go to Jung, hermetics,
but in the context of what

00:09:49.680 --> 00:09:52.410 align:middle line:84%
happens when we have
trashed our nervous system

00:09:52.410 --> 00:09:57.090 align:middle line:84%
through excessive trauma,
anger, sadness, et cetera,

00:09:57.090 --> 00:10:00.570 align:middle line:84%
and how that starts leaching
into and then affecting

00:10:00.570 --> 00:10:04.380 align:middle line:90%
other parts of the mind complex.

00:10:04.380 --> 00:10:06.900 align:middle line:84%
>>BREMNER: Well, yeah,
these different forces,

00:10:06.900 --> 00:10:09.000 align:middle line:84%
as we see in the
hermetic worldview,

00:10:09.000 --> 00:10:11.160 align:middle line:84%
they're associated
with the planets.

00:10:11.160 --> 00:10:14.400 align:middle line:84%
And they work upon
us unconsciously.

00:10:14.400 --> 00:10:17.400 align:middle line:84%
So the planets are
affecting us whether or not

00:10:17.400 --> 00:10:18.610 align:middle line:90%
we're conscious of it.

00:10:18.610 --> 00:10:21.790 align:middle line:84%
But if we're unconscious of
it, which many people are,

00:10:21.790 --> 00:10:25.560 align:middle line:84%
then we're being pulled in these
continuous states of attraction

00:10:25.560 --> 00:10:26.700 align:middle line:90%
and repulsion.

00:10:26.700 --> 00:10:32.310 align:middle line:84%
And they are driving us and
basically determining our fate.

00:10:32.310 --> 00:10:35.880 align:middle line:84%
And the more conscious that we
can become of these influences

00:10:35.880 --> 00:10:39.930 align:middle line:84%
and form a relationship to
these archetypal energies

00:10:39.930 --> 00:10:43.470 align:middle line:84%
that the planets represent,
the more agency and control

00:10:43.470 --> 00:10:47.310 align:middle line:84%
we have over our own destiny
and the more creatively

00:10:47.310 --> 00:10:49.830 align:middle line:84%
we can engage with
reality and with our life.

00:10:49.830 --> 00:10:52.620 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Yes, because it does
have an actual effect on us

00:10:52.620 --> 00:10:56.010 align:middle line:84%
in our own little personal
complex that we carry around.

00:10:56.010 --> 00:10:59.520 align:middle line:84%
The axiom, as above
so below, is really

00:10:59.520 --> 00:11:01.510 align:middle line:84%
quite literal to what
you're speaking of.

00:11:01.510 --> 00:11:02.310 align:middle line:90%
>>BREMNER: Exactly.

00:11:02.310 --> 00:11:05.310 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So if we were
able to rather than look

00:11:05.310 --> 00:11:09.210 align:middle line:84%
at the model in your
seventh-grade astronomy class

00:11:09.210 --> 00:11:12.810 align:middle line:84%
of balls and sticks and saw
each one of these planets

00:11:12.810 --> 00:11:18.240 align:middle line:84%
as a massive archetypal
being that each represents

00:11:18.240 --> 00:11:21.540 align:middle line:84%
an opportunity for growth,
learning, and experience

00:11:21.540 --> 00:11:23.430 align:middle line:90%
in our solar system.

00:11:23.430 --> 00:11:26.970 align:middle line:84%
And it affects us directly
on Earth like benevolent

00:11:26.970 --> 00:11:29.430 align:middle line:84%
teachers-- even
Saturn, even Pluto--

00:11:29.430 --> 00:11:31.170 align:middle line:90%
as benevolent teachers.

00:11:31.170 --> 00:11:33.930 align:middle line:84%
And then I like to take
it down to the personal.

00:11:33.930 --> 00:11:36.990 align:middle line:84%
So you get a hit physical--
and you get a hit emotionally.

00:11:36.990 --> 00:11:41.010 align:middle line:84%
Now your electrical and
nervous system is all trashed.

00:11:41.010 --> 00:11:45.450 align:middle line:84%
Now it's starting to rewire
some kind of a memory and a vent

00:11:45.450 --> 00:11:47.970 align:middle line:84%
in the subconscious, which is
going to come back and keep

00:11:47.970 --> 00:11:51.520 align:middle line:84%
influencing you until it has
been transformed such as what

00:11:51.520 --> 00:11:52.320 align:middle line:90%
you did.

00:11:52.320 --> 00:11:54.320 align:middle line:84%
If you care to explain
that a little bit more so

00:11:54.320 --> 00:11:57.070 align:middle line:84%
people understand what
happens after trauma.

00:11:57.070 --> 00:11:58.950 align:middle line:84%
And you can turn to
Jung if you want.

00:11:58.950 --> 00:11:59.910 align:middle line:90%
>>BREMNER: Yeah.

00:11:59.910 --> 00:12:02.220 align:middle line:84%
Well, I think often
what happens is

00:12:02.220 --> 00:12:04.170 align:middle line:90%
we have these traumatic events.

00:12:04.170 --> 00:12:07.530 align:middle line:84%
And, yes, we keep getting pulled
back to them in different ways

00:12:07.530 --> 00:12:09.940 align:middle line:84%
in order to heal them
and integrate them.

00:12:09.940 --> 00:12:12.210 align:middle line:84%
And another thing
that happens is

00:12:12.210 --> 00:12:17.080 align:middle line:84%
we reject the parts of ourselves
that we don't want to see,

00:12:17.080 --> 00:12:18.440 align:middle line:90%
that we don't want to look at.

00:12:18.440 --> 00:12:21.620 align:middle line:84%
And then we end up projecting
those outward into the world.

00:12:21.620 --> 00:12:25.030 align:middle line:84%
And so we see the enemy
everywhere outside of us.

00:12:25.030 --> 00:12:28.150 align:middle line:84%
And we encounter all these
problems in our relationships

00:12:28.150 --> 00:12:33.490 align:middle line:84%
and in our work life and these
negative expressions of things

00:12:33.490 --> 00:12:37.000 align:middle line:84%
that are actually within us
that we've completely rejected.

00:12:37.000 --> 00:12:40.570 align:middle line:84%
And until we're able to
reclaim those shadow aspects

00:12:40.570 --> 00:12:43.030 align:middle line:84%
and recognize them as
parts of ourselves,

00:12:43.030 --> 00:12:44.620 align:middle line:84%
we're going to
continue to do that,

00:12:44.620 --> 00:12:47.397 align:middle line:84%
and they'll just keep
popping up in new forms.

00:12:47.397 --> 00:12:48.980 align:middle line:84%
And so that's one
way if that happens.

00:12:48.980 --> 00:12:51.370 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And I think
right now whichever

00:12:51.370 --> 00:12:55.870 align:middle line:84%
of the planetary
beings' archetypes

00:12:55.870 --> 00:12:57.760 align:middle line:84%
are influencing us
the most, I think

00:12:57.760 --> 00:12:59.740 align:middle line:84%
we have some good Saturn
happening right now,

00:12:59.740 --> 00:13:02.110 align:middle line:84%
a fair amount of that
affecting people.

00:13:02.110 --> 00:13:06.290 align:middle line:84%
And maybe you can explain
that a little bit.

00:13:06.290 --> 00:13:10.330 align:middle line:84%
We really are going to find
ourselves in this kind of angst

00:13:10.330 --> 00:13:11.350 align:middle line:90%
for the time being.

00:13:11.350 --> 00:13:14.750 align:middle line:84%
That's what the time is calling
for is to, like you said,

00:13:14.750 --> 00:13:18.620 align:middle line:84%
look at the uncomfortable
stuff in us and around us.

00:13:18.620 --> 00:13:20.450 align:middle line:84%
And I think just to
mirror what you said,

00:13:20.450 --> 00:13:22.330 align:middle line:84%
so if we're seeing
a lot of enemies,

00:13:22.330 --> 00:13:25.000 align:middle line:84%
if the world has become our
enemy and that person who

00:13:25.000 --> 00:13:28.270 align:middle line:84%
believes that is our
enemy, that's something

00:13:28.270 --> 00:13:29.900 align:middle line:90%
that we need to go inside for.

00:13:29.900 --> 00:13:30.700 align:middle line:90%
>>BREMNER: Yeah.

00:13:30.700 --> 00:13:32.770 align:middle line:84%
And also just to see
where we're getting

00:13:32.770 --> 00:13:37.450 align:middle line:84%
stuck in certain mental
loops because our thoughts

00:13:37.450 --> 00:13:39.010 align:middle line:90%
do influence reality.

00:13:39.010 --> 00:13:41.570 align:middle line:84%
They do influence the
experiences that we have.

00:13:41.570 --> 00:13:45.640 align:middle line:84%
And so if we're continually
having a certain conversation

00:13:45.640 --> 00:13:51.460 align:middle line:84%
in our head and oftentimes
it'll be a negative conversation

00:13:51.460 --> 00:13:54.790 align:middle line:84%
or a certain thought
loop that we're stuck in,

00:13:54.790 --> 00:13:56.830 align:middle line:84%
those things are
more likely to come

00:13:56.830 --> 00:13:59.500 align:middle line:84%
into being because we're
putting more energy into them

00:13:59.500 --> 00:14:04.140 align:middle line:84%
and spending more
time focusing on them.

00:14:04.140 --> 00:14:09.890 align:middle line:84%
But we can also look to these
archetypal planetary energies.

00:14:09.890 --> 00:14:16.448 align:middle line:84%
And so, say, we're stuck on some
sort of scarcity mentality--

00:14:16.448 --> 00:14:17.990 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Which
people are right now.

00:14:17.990 --> 00:14:19.100 align:middle line:90%
>>BREMNER: A lot of people are.

00:14:19.100 --> 00:14:21.110 align:middle line:84%
And I myself have gone
through this many times.

00:14:21.110 --> 00:14:23.870 align:middle line:84%
And, for me, it's something
that I still work through.

00:14:23.870 --> 00:14:27.770 align:middle line:84%
This isn't an easy thing
to do, but we can slowly

00:14:27.770 --> 00:14:31.250 align:middle line:84%
begin to purify in
an alchemical sense

00:14:31.250 --> 00:14:33.200 align:middle line:84%
the contents of
our own inner world

00:14:33.200 --> 00:14:34.950 align:middle line:90%
and the contents of our mind.

00:14:34.950 --> 00:14:37.820 align:middle line:84%
So this is both
emotional and mental

00:14:37.820 --> 00:14:40.820 align:middle line:90%
and these cyclical processes.

00:14:40.820 --> 00:14:43.580 align:middle line:84%
If we think of air and
water within a vessel

00:14:43.580 --> 00:14:46.430 align:middle line:84%
and a distillation taking
place, for instance,

00:14:46.430 --> 00:14:49.670 align:middle line:84%
where the water is heating
up, and the vapors are rising,

00:14:49.670 --> 00:14:51.620 align:middle line:84%
and then they're
condensing and cooling,

00:14:51.620 --> 00:14:56.580 align:middle line:84%
and you get the essence being
extracted from that process.

00:14:56.580 --> 00:14:59.190 align:middle line:84%
So we can do that
within ourselves,

00:14:59.190 --> 00:15:02.930 align:middle line:84%
within the vessel of our
body where we continually

00:15:02.930 --> 00:15:07.530 align:middle line:84%
clarify and refine the
contents of our inner world.

00:15:07.530 --> 00:15:09.060 align:middle line:90%
And this is a process.

00:15:09.060 --> 00:15:10.670 align:middle line:90%
It takes a lot of time.

00:15:10.670 --> 00:15:12.110 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: It does take time.

00:15:12.110 --> 00:15:15.590 align:middle line:84%
And I'm all for
doing what you can

00:15:15.590 --> 00:15:19.980 align:middle line:84%
by way of getting to the
grounded 3D level of things

00:15:19.980 --> 00:15:25.290 align:middle line:84%
and looking at it from that
possibility to say, OK,

00:15:25.290 --> 00:15:28.670 align:middle line:90%
if all else fails, what's left?

00:15:28.670 --> 00:15:30.650 align:middle line:84%
And then from the
what's-left place,

00:15:30.650 --> 00:15:34.610 align:middle line:84%
start rebuilding and
building from there.

00:15:34.610 --> 00:15:39.920 align:middle line:84%
And I've always found a
kind of freeing that--

00:15:39.920 --> 00:15:44.360 align:middle line:84%
a freedom that occurs in
taking into consider--

00:15:44.360 --> 00:15:47.780 align:middle line:84%
the worst-case scenarios, for
example, considering them.

00:15:47.780 --> 00:15:51.260 align:middle line:84%
And then the scarcity
subject changes.

00:15:51.260 --> 00:15:52.610 align:middle line:90%
It becomes altered.

00:15:52.610 --> 00:15:55.580 align:middle line:84%
It might be that
one's vision of what

00:15:55.580 --> 00:15:57.980 align:middle line:84%
they thought their life was
going to look like may not

00:15:57.980 --> 00:15:59.300 align:middle line:90%
look like that in the moment.

00:15:59.300 --> 00:16:01.970 align:middle line:90%
That's ego for the most part.

00:16:01.970 --> 00:16:04.790 align:middle line:84%
If we let go of that
and say, how can I

00:16:04.790 --> 00:16:08.000 align:middle line:84%
be safe and happy and
productive and let

00:16:08.000 --> 00:16:10.250 align:middle line:84%
go of the egoic
vision of it, you'll

00:16:10.250 --> 00:16:11.810 align:middle line:84%
find there's a
well of creativity

00:16:11.810 --> 00:16:13.070 align:middle line:90%
of how that can happen.

00:16:13.070 --> 00:16:14.070 align:middle line:90%
>>BREMNER: Oh, yeah.

00:16:14.070 --> 00:16:14.870 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:16:14.870 --> 00:16:17.270 align:middle line:84%
And so then the scarcity
starts backing off.

00:16:17.270 --> 00:16:19.280 align:middle line:84%
And once that backs off
and the fear backs off,

00:16:19.280 --> 00:16:21.590 align:middle line:84%
all the creativity
pops in, and you

00:16:21.590 --> 00:16:25.700 align:middle line:84%
end up with beautiful work
like this, for example.

00:16:25.700 --> 00:16:28.730 align:middle line:84%
So I was going to say while
we're in that little arena

00:16:28.730 --> 00:16:32.240 align:middle line:84%
before we go to your artwork,
can you talk a little bit

00:16:32.240 --> 00:16:33.980 align:middle line:84%
about the nature of
Saturn influence,

00:16:33.980 --> 00:16:36.440 align:middle line:84%
a little bit about the
nature of Venus influence?

00:16:36.440 --> 00:16:38.540 align:middle line:84%
Because you do have
some influences

00:16:38.540 --> 00:16:40.890 align:middle line:90%
in this book in the art.

00:16:40.890 --> 00:16:41.690 align:middle line:90%
>>BREMNER: Yeah.

00:16:41.690 --> 00:16:48.620 align:middle line:84%
So Saturn has to do with
limitations and heaviness

00:16:48.620 --> 00:16:49.940 align:middle line:90%
and inertia.

00:16:49.940 --> 00:16:51.890 align:middle line:84%
Saturn's a very
slow-moving planet.

00:16:51.890 --> 00:16:54.890 align:middle line:84%
And it's considered to be cold
and dry because of its distance

00:16:54.890 --> 00:16:56.510 align:middle line:90%
from the sun and the moon.

00:16:56.510 --> 00:17:00.410 align:middle line:84%
And so it has these effects
upon us, cold and dry.

00:17:00.410 --> 00:17:02.690 align:middle line:84%
And when we think of the
first stage in alchemy being

00:17:02.690 --> 00:17:07.640 align:middle line:84%
associated with Saturn, the
nigredo, or the blackening,

00:17:07.640 --> 00:17:12.742 align:middle line:84%
it can feel like a dryness,
like a coldness, like you're--

00:17:12.742 --> 00:17:14.575 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Like you're
not feeling supported.

00:17:14.575 --> 00:17:15.375 align:middle line:90%
>>BREMNER: Exactly.

00:17:15.375 --> 00:17:17.819 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: There's no warmth
and no incubator there.

00:17:17.819 --> 00:17:18.619 align:middle line:90%
>>BREMNER: Yeah.

00:17:18.619 --> 00:17:20.960 align:middle line:84%
Like you're just shivering
in the cold in the dark

00:17:20.960 --> 00:17:23.540 align:middle line:84%
and waiting for some kind
of light or some warmth

00:17:23.540 --> 00:17:24.740 align:middle line:90%
to help revive you.

00:17:24.740 --> 00:17:27.890 align:middle line:84%
But that's such
an essential part

00:17:27.890 --> 00:17:31.880 align:middle line:84%
of the process is to be able
to sit with that discomfort

00:17:31.880 --> 00:17:35.000 align:middle line:84%
and, like you said, to look
at the worst-case scenario

00:17:35.000 --> 00:17:37.640 align:middle line:84%
and to just say, OK,
what's left after that?

00:17:37.640 --> 00:17:41.720 align:middle line:84%
And in that process, we can
get in touch with something

00:17:41.720 --> 00:17:46.230 align:middle line:84%
that's eternal within us, that
essence of who and what we are.

00:17:46.230 --> 00:17:49.040 align:middle line:84%
And I think that's
really the gift of Saturn

00:17:49.040 --> 00:17:53.150 align:middle line:84%
is once we can
face our mortality

00:17:53.150 --> 00:17:56.000 align:middle line:84%
and all of our fears
and limitations,

00:17:56.000 --> 00:17:58.575 align:middle line:84%
then that opens up a whole
world of possibility--

00:17:58.575 --> 00:17:59.450 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Absolutely.

00:17:59.450 --> 00:18:00.570 align:middle line:90%
>>BREMNER: --and freedom.

00:18:00.570 --> 00:18:05.090 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So if we can imagine
Saturn as a benevolent teacher

00:18:05.090 --> 00:18:08.970 align:middle line:84%
again, it's like sometimes
we have to go and take

00:18:08.970 --> 00:18:09.770 align:middle line:90%
a little algebra.

00:18:09.770 --> 00:18:11.870 align:middle line:84%
It's not all art
class all the time.

00:18:11.870 --> 00:18:12.740 align:middle line:90%
>>BREMNER: Yeah.

00:18:12.740 --> 00:18:14.510 align:middle line:84%
And Saturn is also
about discipline.

00:18:14.510 --> 00:18:15.530 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes, exactly.

00:18:15.530 --> 00:18:15.830 align:middle line:90%
>>BREMNER: Yeah.

00:18:15.830 --> 00:18:18.170 align:middle line:84%
Dedication and being able
to see things through.

00:18:18.170 --> 00:18:19.710 align:middle line:84%
So there's many
positive qualities.

00:18:19.710 --> 00:18:20.510 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:18:20.510 --> 00:18:22.190 align:middle line:90%
So that's the being Saturn.

00:18:22.190 --> 00:18:24.930 align:middle line:84%
Let's talk about
the being of Venus.

00:18:24.930 --> 00:18:26.250 align:middle line:90%
>>BREMNER: Of Venus?

00:18:26.250 --> 00:18:28.640 align:middle line:84%
Well, Venus is associated
with the heart chakra

00:18:28.640 --> 00:18:32.240 align:middle line:84%
and with the heart, in general,
and with love and the metal

00:18:32.240 --> 00:18:35.570 align:middle line:84%
copper and the
propensity toward union.

00:18:35.570 --> 00:18:39.140 align:middle line:84%
So essentially, Venus
represents that force

00:18:39.140 --> 00:18:41.150 align:middle line:84%
in the universe that
brings things together

00:18:41.150 --> 00:18:43.340 align:middle line:90%
that coagulates and that binds.

00:18:43.340 --> 00:18:49.640 align:middle line:84%
And she helps us to connect with
beauty and our aesthetic sense

00:18:49.640 --> 00:18:56.210 align:middle line:84%
and our values and also money
and finances but everything

00:18:56.210 --> 00:19:00.410 align:middle line:84%
that makes us feel luxurious
and helps us to feel

00:19:00.410 --> 00:19:03.890 align:middle line:84%
the splendor of being alive
and the joy of creativity,

00:19:03.890 --> 00:19:06.170 align:middle line:90%
the joy of being alive.

00:19:06.170 --> 00:19:07.220 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:19:07.220 --> 00:19:09.770 align:middle line:84%
Certainly, one of-- I think
most of the people watching

00:19:09.770 --> 00:19:11.570 align:middle line:84%
this right now,
Venus is definitely

00:19:11.570 --> 00:19:13.340 align:middle line:90%
one of their favorite planets.

00:19:13.340 --> 00:19:14.310 align:middle line:90%
No doubt about it.

00:19:14.310 --> 00:19:16.508 align:middle line:84%
And were you going to
say something from that?

00:19:16.508 --> 00:19:18.550 align:middle line:84%
>>BREMNER: Oh, but they
all have their dark side,

00:19:18.550 --> 00:19:19.350 align:middle line:90%
all the planets.

00:19:19.350 --> 00:19:21.230 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Let's talk
about the dark side.

00:19:21.230 --> 00:19:22.700 align:middle line:84%
I don't know that
we want to touch

00:19:22.700 --> 00:19:24.880 align:middle line:84%
on the dark side of Saturn
because the light side is

00:19:24.880 --> 00:19:25.680 align:middle line:90%
hard enough.

00:19:25.680 --> 00:19:27.840 align:middle line:84%
But let's talk about
the dark side of Venus.

00:19:27.840 --> 00:19:29.465 align:middle line:84%
>>BREMNER: Well, the
dark side of Venus

00:19:29.465 --> 00:19:37.820 align:middle line:84%
might be experienced by someone
as jealousy or envy or pride.

00:19:37.820 --> 00:19:40.580 align:middle line:84%
And there's a lot of
mythology going along

00:19:40.580 --> 00:19:43.970 align:middle line:84%
with Venus and her more
ancient forms in the Sumerian

00:19:43.970 --> 00:19:49.130 align:middle line:84%
and Babylonian Ishtar and Inanna
who was also a warrior goddess,

00:19:49.130 --> 00:19:51.980 align:middle line:84%
and in some cases and
some of the myths,

00:19:51.980 --> 00:19:54.620 align:middle line:90%
very vengeful and angry.

00:19:54.620 --> 00:19:56.930 align:middle line:90%
And I love the myth of Inanna.

00:19:56.930 --> 00:19:58.730 align:middle line:84%
And I talk about
this in the book

00:19:58.730 --> 00:20:02.730 align:middle line:84%
because she basically hasn't
acknowledged her own shadow

00:20:02.730 --> 00:20:03.530 align:middle line:90%
side.

00:20:03.530 --> 00:20:07.160 align:middle line:84%
And so she feels compelled
to go into the underworld

00:20:07.160 --> 00:20:09.920 align:middle line:84%
to meet her dark sister
who's Ereshkigal,

00:20:09.920 --> 00:20:11.480 align:middle line:90%
the queen of the underworld.

00:20:11.480 --> 00:20:14.780 align:middle line:84%
And in the process, she has
to give up all of her power.

00:20:14.780 --> 00:20:16.520 align:middle line:84%
She has to give up
heaven and Earth

00:20:16.520 --> 00:20:19.640 align:middle line:84%
and be stripped of all
of her seven powers.

00:20:19.640 --> 00:20:23.330 align:middle line:84%
So essentially, going
down to the bare essence

00:20:23.330 --> 00:20:27.170 align:middle line:84%
of who she is and,
in her nakedness,

00:20:27.170 --> 00:20:29.720 align:middle line:84%
kneeling before the
queen of the underworld.

00:20:29.720 --> 00:20:32.900 align:middle line:84%
And she's judged
down there and turned

00:20:32.900 --> 00:20:36.320 align:middle line:84%
into a rotting piece of flesh
upon the wall of the underworld

00:20:36.320 --> 00:20:38.280 align:middle line:90%
and not allowed to leave.

00:20:38.280 --> 00:20:44.180 align:middle line:84%
And basically, she goes
through the whole death process

00:20:44.180 --> 00:20:46.520 align:middle line:84%
while she's facing
her shadow aspect

00:20:46.520 --> 00:20:48.440 align:middle line:90%
in the form of Ereshkigal.

00:20:48.440 --> 00:20:51.650 align:middle line:84%
And in order to leave, she
has to call upon divine aid.

00:20:51.650 --> 00:20:52.790 align:middle line:90%
But she can't just leave.

00:20:52.790 --> 00:20:54.150 align:middle line:90%
Someone has to take her place.

00:20:54.150 --> 00:20:57.690 align:middle line:84%
And so she goes back
up to the upper world

00:20:57.690 --> 00:21:00.740 align:middle line:84%
and tries to figure out who's
going to take her place.

00:21:00.740 --> 00:21:03.650 align:middle line:84%
And it ends up being her
husband who has taken her throne

00:21:03.650 --> 00:21:09.450 align:middle line:84%
and shows no sign of grieving
for her death or anything.

00:21:09.450 --> 00:21:10.250 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: OK.

00:21:10.250 --> 00:21:11.460 align:middle line:90%
There's the dark side--

00:21:11.460 --> 00:21:13.168 align:middle line:84%
>>BREMNER: That's the
dark side of Venus.

00:21:13.168 --> 00:21:14.940 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: --of Venus.

00:21:14.940 --> 00:21:16.820 align:middle line:90%
With that because--

00:21:16.820 --> 00:21:19.790 align:middle line:84%
I think this-- we're going
to go to your artwork

00:21:19.790 --> 00:21:21.620 align:middle line:84%
now and take people
through your artwork

00:21:21.620 --> 00:21:25.280 align:middle line:84%
because I just think they're
going to be enchanted by it.

00:21:25.280 --> 00:21:27.680 align:middle line:84%
But the first piece
we're looking at

00:21:27.680 --> 00:21:29.270 align:middle line:84%
is called the death
of the profane.

00:21:29.270 --> 00:21:32.270 align:middle line:84%
And it speaks to what you
just said, the putrification.

00:21:32.270 --> 00:21:35.010 align:middle line:84%
Without that, there
is no generation.

00:21:35.010 --> 00:21:38.450 align:middle line:84%
So explain what we're
seeing with this skull

00:21:38.450 --> 00:21:42.330 align:middle line:84%
and with the blossoms and the
snakes coming down in the top.

00:21:42.330 --> 00:21:43.890 align:middle line:90%
We see the sun and moon.

00:21:43.890 --> 00:21:45.580 align:middle line:90%
Tell us what we're seeing here.

00:21:45.580 --> 00:21:48.570 align:middle line:84%
>>BREMNER: Well, this is like
a mirror for people to gaze

00:21:48.570 --> 00:21:54.060 align:middle line:84%
into, that confrontation with
mortality and memento mori,

00:21:54.060 --> 00:21:56.580 align:middle line:90%
remember death and--

00:21:56.580 --> 00:21:58.080 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And
Inanna having to go

00:21:58.080 --> 00:22:01.650 align:middle line:84%
through this process
of becoming, well,

00:22:01.650 --> 00:22:02.910 align:middle line:90%
putrefying, basically.

00:22:02.910 --> 00:22:04.080 align:middle line:90%
>>BREMNER: Yeah.

00:22:04.080 --> 00:22:07.020 align:middle line:84%
We see in the
painting a depiction

00:22:07.020 --> 00:22:08.970 align:middle line:84%
of the caduceus,
the interweaving

00:22:08.970 --> 00:22:13.960 align:middle line:84%
serpents of the active and
passive energies of the body.

00:22:13.960 --> 00:22:19.710 align:middle line:84%
And these are forming a
ouroboros around this skull

00:22:19.710 --> 00:22:22.440 align:middle line:84%
and around this
golden circle, which

00:22:22.440 --> 00:22:26.310 align:middle line:84%
represents the fullness,
the wholeness of the moment

00:22:26.310 --> 00:22:28.980 align:middle line:84%
that we all exist in,
especially when we can

00:22:28.980 --> 00:22:32.040 align:middle line:90%
confront our fear of mortality.

00:22:32.040 --> 00:22:34.500 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Yes, and highly
symbolic in a hermetic sense,

00:22:34.500 --> 00:22:35.830 align:middle line:90%
all of it.

00:22:35.830 --> 00:22:36.630 align:middle line:90%
Beautiful.

00:22:36.630 --> 00:22:37.430 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:22:37.430 --> 00:22:42.010 align:middle line:84%
And now we come to concordia
oppositorum, right?

00:22:42.010 --> 00:22:42.810 align:middle line:90%
>>BREMNER: Yes.

00:22:42.810 --> 00:22:44.850 align:middle line:90%
Concordia oppositorum.

00:22:44.850 --> 00:22:47.920 align:middle line:84%
This is a truce
between the opposites.

00:22:47.920 --> 00:22:48.720 align:middle line:90%
They are--

00:22:48.720 --> 00:22:50.040 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Between the
light and the dark?

00:22:50.040 --> 00:22:51.790 align:middle line:84%
>>BREMNER: Between the
light and the dark,

00:22:51.790 --> 00:22:54.620 align:middle line:84%
between chaos and
order, or you could even

00:22:54.620 --> 00:22:57.560 align:middle line:84%
say between Saturn
and Jupiter who I

00:22:57.560 --> 00:22:59.570 align:middle line:90%
see representing those forces.

00:22:59.570 --> 00:23:03.830 align:middle line:84%
And they are not
locked together.

00:23:03.830 --> 00:23:06.260 align:middle line:84%
They are each in their
own ouroboros shape.

00:23:06.260 --> 00:23:08.940 align:middle line:84%
But they're intertwined, and
they can let go at any moment.

00:23:08.940 --> 00:23:11.210 align:middle line:84%
So they're agreeing
to be at peace.

00:23:11.210 --> 00:23:13.710 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: But they seem to
consume each other at the tail.

00:23:13.710 --> 00:23:14.960 align:middle line:90%
>>BREMNER: A little bit, yeah.

00:23:14.960 --> 00:23:16.793 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Is that more
just locking together

00:23:16.793 --> 00:23:17.990 align:middle line:90%
in their own wholeness?

00:23:17.990 --> 00:23:19.190 align:middle line:84%
>>BREMNER: Yeah,
they're locked together

00:23:19.190 --> 00:23:20.148 align:middle line:90%
in their own wholeness.

00:23:20.148 --> 00:23:21.050 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:23:21.050 --> 00:23:21.350 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:23:21.350 --> 00:23:24.170 align:middle line:84%
So I want to take a moment now
before we go to the next play

00:23:24.170 --> 00:23:26.330 align:middle line:84%
because I was going to ask
you to go into the light

00:23:26.330 --> 00:23:27.920 align:middle line:90%
and dark of Jupiter.

00:23:27.920 --> 00:23:28.850 align:middle line:90%
>>BREMNER: Oh, yeah.

00:23:28.850 --> 00:23:29.360 align:middle line:90%
The light and dark--

00:23:29.360 --> 00:23:31.068 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Because
everyone loves Jupiter.

00:23:31.068 --> 00:23:35.120 align:middle line:84%
It means, oh, I have
money coming my way.

00:23:35.120 --> 00:23:38.390 align:middle line:84%
And we bring everything down
to its most base levels,

00:23:38.390 --> 00:23:39.230 align:middle line:90%
base materials.

00:23:39.230 --> 00:23:40.495 align:middle line:90%
So tell us about Jupiter.

00:23:40.495 --> 00:23:41.870 align:middle line:84%
>>BREMNER: Well,
yeah, that would

00:23:41.870 --> 00:23:43.490 align:middle line:90%
be the light side of Jupiter.

00:23:43.490 --> 00:23:49.190 align:middle line:84%
Expansion, joviality, joy
for life, money and riches,

00:23:49.190 --> 00:23:52.080 align:middle line:84%
growth, all of these
wonderful things.

00:23:52.080 --> 00:23:54.050 align:middle line:84%
But the dark side
of Jupiter would

00:23:54.050 --> 00:24:00.300 align:middle line:84%
be a tendency towards
excess or gluttony or lust.

00:24:00.300 --> 00:24:01.510 align:middle line:90%
And Jupiter is associated--

00:24:01.510 --> 00:24:02.310 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Greed.

00:24:02.310 --> 00:24:03.870 align:middle line:90%
>>BREMNER: Greed as well, yeah.

00:24:03.870 --> 00:24:06.300 align:middle line:84%
Jupiter is associated
with the sacral chakra.

00:24:06.300 --> 00:24:07.890 align:middle line:90%
And this is our water chakra.

00:24:07.890 --> 00:24:10.890 align:middle line:84%
And this has to do with
relationships and emotions

00:24:10.890 --> 00:24:13.450 align:middle line:90%
and creativity and sexuality.

00:24:13.450 --> 00:24:16.525 align:middle line:84%
So the negative
expressions that can

00:24:16.525 --> 00:24:18.150 align:middle line:84%
come when that chakra
is out of balance

00:24:18.150 --> 00:24:21.150 align:middle line:84%
are associated with those
negative qualities of Jupiter

00:24:21.150 --> 00:24:23.110 align:middle line:84%
as well, the dark
side of Jupiter.

00:24:23.110 --> 00:24:25.290 align:middle line:90%
So, yeah, again, lust and--

00:24:25.290 --> 00:24:30.270 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And greed
and envy coveting.

00:24:30.270 --> 00:24:32.010 align:middle line:84%
And anyone along
the way, since we're

00:24:32.010 --> 00:24:35.580 align:middle line:84%
talking about this in the truest
sense, these are entities.

00:24:35.580 --> 00:24:38.880 align:middle line:84%
These aren't masses
of rocks moving

00:24:38.880 --> 00:24:40.390 align:middle line:90%
through the solar system.

00:24:40.390 --> 00:24:44.360 align:middle line:84%
They have conscious intelligence
just as Gaia Earth has herself.

00:24:44.360 --> 00:24:46.860 align:middle line:84%
So if we look at that, anyone
can go and look at their chart

00:24:46.860 --> 00:24:49.530 align:middle line:84%
and see how their Venus
is situated right now

00:24:49.530 --> 00:24:52.470 align:middle line:84%
or their Jupiter, Saturn is
situated in their own chart

00:24:52.470 --> 00:24:56.310 align:middle line:84%
as we move through
these times cosmically.

00:24:56.310 --> 00:24:59.320 align:middle line:84%
And this is helpful to have
this understanding of the light

00:24:59.320 --> 00:25:00.120 align:middle line:90%
and dark.

00:25:00.120 --> 00:25:02.580 align:middle line:84%
And you can tell if
there's a train or a square

00:25:02.580 --> 00:25:05.440 align:middle line:84%
there where your
Jupiter is, for example.

00:25:05.440 --> 00:25:06.240 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:25:06.240 --> 00:25:10.560 align:middle line:84%
So here, we have the
composition of the waters.

00:25:10.560 --> 00:25:12.420 align:middle line:90%
This is very powerful.

00:25:12.420 --> 00:25:14.220 align:middle line:84%
Tell us what we're
looking at here.

00:25:14.220 --> 00:25:17.010 align:middle line:84%
>>BREMNER: Well, this painting
took about eight months

00:25:17.010 --> 00:25:17.850 align:middle line:90%
to complete.

00:25:17.850 --> 00:25:19.590 align:middle line:84%
And, for me, it
was the first time

00:25:19.590 --> 00:25:23.590 align:middle line:84%
that I allowed myself to
paint something spontaneously.

00:25:23.590 --> 00:25:25.480 align:middle line:90%
So it wasn't premeditated.

00:25:25.480 --> 00:25:26.670 align:middle line:90%
I didn't plan it out.

00:25:26.670 --> 00:25:30.180 align:middle line:84%
I just started applying
paint to this large panel

00:25:30.180 --> 00:25:32.070 align:middle line:90%
and seeing what emerged.

00:25:32.070 --> 00:25:34.847 align:middle line:84%
And as forms and faces and
things started to emerge--

00:25:34.847 --> 00:25:36.180 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Lots of faces in here.

00:25:36.180 --> 00:25:38.050 align:middle line:90%
This little owl up above.

00:25:38.050 --> 00:25:38.850 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:25:38.850 --> 00:25:40.392 align:middle line:84%
>>BREMNER: As they
started to emerge,

00:25:40.392 --> 00:25:42.960 align:middle line:84%
then I could say, oh, that
looks kind of like this,

00:25:42.960 --> 00:25:44.650 align:middle line:84%
and that makes me
think about that.

00:25:44.650 --> 00:25:47.880 align:middle line:10%
And it would be
influenced by dreams

00:25:47.880 --> 00:25:49.800 align:middle line:10%
that I was having and
experiences that I

00:25:49.800 --> 00:25:52.180 align:middle line:10%
was having while I was
working on the painting.

00:25:52.180 --> 00:25:55.930 align:middle line:84%
So it was very much a process
of discovery and unfolding.

00:25:55.930 --> 00:25:56.730 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:25:56.730 --> 00:25:59.288 align:middle line:84%
In fact, you have here-- it's
described as the dissolution

00:25:59.288 --> 00:26:00.705 align:middle line:84%
and upwelling of
the unconscious--

00:26:00.705 --> 00:26:01.200 align:middle line:90%
>>BREMNER: Exactly.

00:26:01.200 --> 00:26:02.910 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: --merging the
inner and outer worlds.

00:26:02.910 --> 00:26:03.240 align:middle line:90%
>>BREMNER: Yeah.

00:26:03.240 --> 00:26:05.400 align:middle line:10%
And that's a technique
that the surrealists used

00:26:05.400 --> 00:26:08.040 align:middle line:10%
to access and express
the unconscious

00:26:08.040 --> 00:26:10.530 align:middle line:10%
was to paint or to
draw in a way that

00:26:10.530 --> 00:26:14.010 align:middle line:10%
was very automatic and
unfiltered and allowing

00:26:14.010 --> 00:26:16.350 align:middle line:10%
the unconscious
to express itself

00:26:16.350 --> 00:26:20.130 align:middle line:10%
just as it is without regulating
it with the conscious mind.

00:26:20.130 --> 00:26:21.780 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Without
overanalyzing it.

00:26:21.780 --> 00:26:24.700 align:middle line:84%
Up in the upper right corner,
we have an urn with water,

00:26:24.700 --> 00:26:26.260 align:middle line:90%
it appears, pouring out of it.

00:26:26.260 --> 00:26:28.530 align:middle line:84%
We have a little owl
just to the left of that.

00:26:28.530 --> 00:26:30.450 align:middle line:90%
What is this urn representing?

00:26:30.450 --> 00:26:32.730 align:middle line:84%
>>BREMNER: Well, that whole
right side of the painting

00:26:32.730 --> 00:26:37.230 align:middle line:84%
represents the inner world
and the role of the priestess

00:26:37.230 --> 00:26:39.468 align:middle line:84%
and the connection
with the divine

00:26:39.468 --> 00:26:41.010 align:middle line:84%
whereas the left
side of the painting

00:26:41.010 --> 00:26:44.160 align:middle line:84%
is more about the
body and nature.

00:26:44.160 --> 00:26:47.910 align:middle line:84%
And the whole painting
is about the integration

00:26:47.910 --> 00:26:48.820 align:middle line:90%
of these things.

00:26:48.820 --> 00:26:53.520 align:middle line:84%
And so that priestess is
receiving the divine waters

00:26:53.520 --> 00:26:55.920 align:middle line:90%
of the cosmos, of the heavens.

00:26:55.920 --> 00:26:59.320 align:middle line:84%
And she's receiving
it into her own crown.

00:26:59.320 --> 00:27:00.120 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: OK.

00:27:00.120 --> 00:27:02.760 align:middle line:84%
Now we'll go to the light--
this is one of my favorite ones.

00:27:02.760 --> 00:27:03.850 align:middle line:90%
I just love it.

00:27:03.850 --> 00:27:06.060 align:middle line:90%
It makes me happy to look at it.

00:27:06.060 --> 00:27:09.060 align:middle line:84%
It brings about feelings,
for me, of happiness.

00:27:09.060 --> 00:27:10.410 align:middle line:90%
The light bearer.

00:27:10.410 --> 00:27:13.560 align:middle line:84%
This is called the cross
rose in the Garden of Venus.

00:27:13.560 --> 00:27:16.440 align:middle line:84%
And the explanation for
it is the light bearer

00:27:16.440 --> 00:27:19.590 align:middle line:84%
points the wonders to
the waters of renewal

00:27:19.590 --> 00:27:23.400 align:middle line:84%
and away from the
tail of the scorpion.

00:27:23.400 --> 00:27:25.350 align:middle line:84%
>>BREMNER: So this is a
Venus-themed painting.

00:27:25.350 --> 00:27:27.570 align:middle line:84%
Many people will
recognize her symbol there

00:27:27.570 --> 00:27:29.250 align:middle line:90%
on the altar cloth.

00:27:29.250 --> 00:27:33.570 align:middle line:84%
And Lucifer, the light
bearer, is another name

00:27:33.570 --> 00:27:35.490 align:middle line:90%
for Venus as the morning star.

00:27:35.490 --> 00:27:38.820 align:middle line:84%
And so in that role,
she's guiding us--

00:27:38.820 --> 00:27:40.050 align:middle line:90%
she's heralding the dawn.

00:27:40.050 --> 00:27:43.080 align:middle line:84%
She's guiding us out of
the dark night of the soul.

00:27:43.080 --> 00:27:45.660 align:middle line:84%
And that's another
role of Venus is

00:27:45.660 --> 00:27:48.090 align:middle line:84%
while she does make this
underworld journey when she

00:27:48.090 --> 00:27:49.530 align:middle line:84%
goes through her
retrograde phase

00:27:49.530 --> 00:27:52.650 align:middle line:84%
and disappears for a time,
she also draws us back

00:27:52.650 --> 00:27:54.010 align:middle line:90%
into the light.

00:27:54.010 --> 00:27:57.260 align:middle line:84%
And so this painting
is about that role

00:27:57.260 --> 00:28:00.320 align:middle line:84%
of Venus as the light
bearer and the choice

00:28:00.320 --> 00:28:03.470 align:middle line:84%
that we have to either go
into the Garden of Venus

00:28:03.470 --> 00:28:05.630 align:middle line:84%
or to go towards the
tail of the scorpion.

00:28:05.630 --> 00:28:07.970 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:28:07.970 --> 00:28:10.800 align:middle line:84%
I think most people can just
feel the weight of those words.

00:28:10.800 --> 00:28:11.600 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:28:11.600 --> 00:28:12.530 align:middle line:90%
Here's Venus again.

00:28:12.530 --> 00:28:13.330 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:28:13.330 --> 00:28:15.620 align:middle line:84%
Now this one is more
like the anonymous story

00:28:15.620 --> 00:28:16.500 align:middle line:90%
you were telling.

00:28:16.500 --> 00:28:17.300 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:28:17.300 --> 00:28:21.530 align:middle line:84%
So we're talking about
"The Book of Blue Vitriol."

00:28:21.530 --> 00:28:23.450 align:middle line:84%
Venus descends
into the underworld

00:28:23.450 --> 00:28:26.210 align:middle line:84%
to be reconciled
with her animus.

00:28:26.210 --> 00:28:29.810 align:middle line:84%
And tell us, as we
go into this, what

00:28:29.810 --> 00:28:32.360 align:middle line:90%
the rabbits represent in this.

00:28:32.360 --> 00:28:34.790 align:middle line:84%
And here, we see at
the bottom a bunny

00:28:34.790 --> 00:28:37.490 align:middle line:90%
with her little offspring.

00:28:37.490 --> 00:28:39.800 align:middle line:84%
>>BREMNER: Well, rabbits
are associated with Venus

00:28:39.800 --> 00:28:41.810 align:middle line:90%
and also with the moon.

00:28:41.810 --> 00:28:46.190 align:middle line:10%
Venus has to do also with
generation and multiplicity.

00:28:46.190 --> 00:28:48.620 align:middle line:84%
And so you see the
seven children,

00:28:48.620 --> 00:28:51.020 align:middle line:84%
the seven baby rabbits
there with the mother

00:28:51.020 --> 00:28:53.420 align:middle line:90%
who's in the underworld.

00:28:53.420 --> 00:28:56.300 align:middle line:84%
And then the male
rabbit, jackrabbit,

00:28:56.300 --> 00:29:00.020 align:middle line:84%
is more connected with
this archetypal father

00:29:00.020 --> 00:29:04.580 align:middle line:84%
figure that's represented
in the rocks behind him.

00:29:04.580 --> 00:29:07.520 align:middle line:84%
I think I chose the
rabbits because I'd

00:29:07.520 --> 00:29:10.205 align:middle line:84%
been seeing a lot of
jackrabbits in New Mexico.

00:29:10.205 --> 00:29:12.080 align:middle line:84%
And it was a new creature
for me to encounter

00:29:12.080 --> 00:29:13.670 align:middle line:90%
and to work with spiritually.

00:29:13.670 --> 00:29:16.070 align:middle line:84%
So I wanted to
honor that in a way.

00:29:16.070 --> 00:29:20.400 align:middle line:84%
And the painting itself brought
me on a complete underworld

00:29:20.400 --> 00:29:21.200 align:middle line:90%
journey.

00:29:21.200 --> 00:29:22.340 align:middle line:90%
And I started it with Venus--

00:29:22.340 --> 00:29:24.632 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Yeah, you can see
elements of the underworld,

00:29:24.632 --> 00:29:29.460 align:middle line:84%
and you can see the skulls,
and the ancient decrepit ebony

00:29:29.460 --> 00:29:30.260 align:middle line:90%
hands.

00:29:30.260 --> 00:29:30.950 align:middle line:90%
>>BREMNER: Exactly.

00:29:30.950 --> 00:29:31.750 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:29:31.750 --> 00:29:34.190 align:middle line:84%
So it started when
Venus was the evening

00:29:34.190 --> 00:29:38.420 align:middle line:84%
star when she's associated
more with being a lover.

00:29:38.420 --> 00:29:41.660 align:middle line:84%
And then as I progressed
with the painting,

00:29:41.660 --> 00:29:45.050 align:middle line:84%
she disappeared and went through
her whole retrograde phase.

00:29:45.050 --> 00:29:49.170 align:middle line:84%
And when she re-emerged, that's
when I completed the painting.

00:29:49.170 --> 00:29:51.320 align:middle line:84%
So it was like going through
the entire underworld

00:29:51.320 --> 00:29:54.170 align:middle line:84%
journey with Venus while
completing the painting

00:29:54.170 --> 00:29:58.100 align:middle line:84%
and painting all of
those spooky rocks

00:29:58.100 --> 00:29:59.720 align:middle line:90%
and expressing that darkness.

00:29:59.720 --> 00:30:01.095 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Yes,
that's not the one

00:30:01.095 --> 00:30:04.400 align:middle line:84%
I would choose to put on my
wall, but some people would.

00:30:04.400 --> 00:30:06.200 align:middle line:84%
So let's talk a moment--
you just mentioned

00:30:06.200 --> 00:30:08.750 align:middle line:90%
it, Venus in retrograde.

00:30:08.750 --> 00:30:10.670 align:middle line:84%
We always think of
mercury in retrograde

00:30:10.670 --> 00:30:14.150 align:middle line:84%
and what that does to
screw up our meetings

00:30:14.150 --> 00:30:17.540 align:middle line:84%
with people and deals we've
made and flights and so forth.

00:30:17.540 --> 00:30:20.210 align:middle line:84%
What happens when
Venus is in retrograde?

00:30:20.210 --> 00:30:24.890 align:middle line:84%
>>BREMNER: I think when
Venus is in retrograde,

00:30:24.890 --> 00:30:28.460 align:middle line:84%
it's helpful to look at the last
time that she was in retrograde

00:30:28.460 --> 00:30:31.670 align:middle line:84%
and to look at what signs
she's retrograding in

00:30:31.670 --> 00:30:34.490 align:middle line:84%
and to reflect back on what
was going on in our life

00:30:34.490 --> 00:30:37.550 align:middle line:84%
the last time she retrograded
in that sign or the last time

00:30:37.550 --> 00:30:39.050 align:middle line:90%
she retrograded in general.

00:30:39.050 --> 00:30:44.300 align:middle line:84%
And it will often, I think, have
to do with love relationships

00:30:44.300 --> 00:30:46.800 align:middle line:84%
and relationships in general
and different healing

00:30:46.800 --> 00:30:47.600 align:middle line:90%
that we need--

00:30:47.600 --> 00:30:49.225 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: To go back
and revisit these.

00:30:49.225 --> 00:30:53.990 align:middle line:84%
>>BREMNER: Yeah, healing that we
need to do related to the past.

00:30:53.990 --> 00:30:55.490 align:middle line:90%
And yeah, looking back.

00:30:55.490 --> 00:30:58.578 align:middle line:84%
Kind of like with mercury as
a looking back and review.

00:30:58.578 --> 00:31:00.620 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: It's where we
tend to learn everything.

00:31:00.620 --> 00:31:03.380 align:middle line:84%
Mercury and retrograde can
make things very inconvenient.

00:31:03.380 --> 00:31:05.840 align:middle line:84%
Phoenix and Venus
in retrograde really

00:31:05.840 --> 00:31:08.030 align:middle line:84%
can take you more
to the mat, again,

00:31:08.030 --> 00:31:10.850 align:middle line:84%
reviewing things
that have caused--

00:31:10.850 --> 00:31:14.070 align:middle line:84%
like we talked about earlier,
trauma and so forth now.

00:31:14.070 --> 00:31:14.870 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:31:14.870 --> 00:31:17.310 align:middle line:84%
Now we go to plate
six in your book.

00:31:17.310 --> 00:31:19.040 align:middle line:90%
It's called emergence.

00:31:19.040 --> 00:31:21.800 align:middle line:84%
And the anima emerges
from the desert chalice

00:31:21.800 --> 00:31:25.250 align:middle line:84%
as the spirit ascends
from the corpus.

00:31:25.250 --> 00:31:27.110 align:middle line:84%
And that looks like
a self-portrait.

00:31:27.110 --> 00:31:28.025 align:middle line:90%
That's you.

00:31:28.025 --> 00:31:28.460 align:middle line:90%
>>BREMNER: Yeah.

00:31:28.460 --> 00:31:30.380 align:middle line:84%
Many of them are pretty
much self-portraits,

00:31:30.380 --> 00:31:33.650 align:middle line:84%
whether they're
figures or animals.

00:31:33.650 --> 00:31:36.520 align:middle line:84%
Yeah, this was one of my
first successfully completed

00:31:36.520 --> 00:31:37.320 align:middle line:90%
paintings.

00:31:37.320 --> 00:31:39.560 align:middle line:84%
It took me a total
of three years,

00:31:39.560 --> 00:31:41.480 align:middle line:84%
not because it took
that long to paint,

00:31:41.480 --> 00:31:44.150 align:middle line:84%
but because I had to let
it sit and gestate and--

00:31:44.150 --> 00:31:46.070 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Come back to it.

00:31:46.070 --> 00:31:49.880 align:middle line:84%
>>BREMNER: And it was very
much about me learning how

00:31:49.880 --> 00:31:54.265 align:middle line:84%
to express my own creativity
and to come out of this--

00:31:54.265 --> 00:31:55.640 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Emerge
from the desert.

00:31:55.640 --> 00:31:56.870 align:middle line:84%
>>BREMNER: Emerge
from the desert, yeah.

00:31:56.870 --> 00:31:58.580 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: In almost
infertile soil.

00:31:58.580 --> 00:32:01.010 align:middle line:90%
>>BREMNER: Yeah, exactly.

00:32:01.010 --> 00:32:02.900 align:middle line:84%
And to allow that
to be expressed.

00:32:02.900 --> 00:32:05.610 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And then up above,
you have a little monkey.

00:32:05.610 --> 00:32:06.410 align:middle line:90%
>>BREMNER: Yes.

00:32:06.410 --> 00:32:09.540 align:middle line:84%
So the monkey represents
the ape of the mind.

00:32:09.540 --> 00:32:10.790 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Oh, the monkey mind.

00:32:10.790 --> 00:32:12.980 align:middle line:84%
>>BREMNER: The
monkey mind, yeah.

00:32:12.980 --> 00:32:15.725 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Now, that's my least
favorite part of being human.

00:32:15.725 --> 00:32:16.850 align:middle line:90%
>>BREMNER: The monkey mind?

00:32:16.850 --> 00:32:17.360 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:32:17.360 --> 00:32:18.620 align:middle line:90%
I don't like to indulge it.

00:32:18.620 --> 00:32:20.510 align:middle line:84%
And, I mean, this is
something that I think

00:32:20.510 --> 00:32:23.450 align:middle line:90%
we have to learn how to manage.

00:32:23.450 --> 00:32:26.810 align:middle line:84%
And when I was younger, I would
experience more monkey mind.

00:32:26.810 --> 00:32:31.010 align:middle line:84%
Now when it happens at all, it's
just, to me, almost grotesque

00:32:31.010 --> 00:32:32.900 align:middle line:90%
because it's one of the loops.

00:32:32.900 --> 00:32:36.470 align:middle line:84%
And I feel like I want
to run as fast as I

00:32:36.470 --> 00:32:37.820 align:middle line:90%
can to get away from that.

00:32:37.820 --> 00:32:40.830 align:middle line:84%
And many, many people at
different phases in their life,

00:32:40.830 --> 00:32:44.660 align:middle line:84%
especially if there's trauma,
something shocking, unexpected

00:32:44.660 --> 00:32:48.140 align:middle line:84%
can end up in monkey mind,
trying to reconcile it.

00:32:48.140 --> 00:32:51.530 align:middle line:84%
So, for you, besides doing
your artwork, what would

00:32:51.530 --> 00:32:54.170 align:middle line:84%
you have to say by
way of words of wisdom

00:32:54.170 --> 00:32:55.700 align:middle line:84%
to people who find
themselves locked

00:32:55.700 --> 00:32:59.180 align:middle line:84%
in the same dialogue over and
over in their brain monkey

00:32:59.180 --> 00:33:00.710 align:middle line:90%
mind?

00:33:00.710 --> 00:33:04.380 align:middle line:84%
>>BREMNER: Well, I mean,
I think finding a way

00:33:04.380 --> 00:33:09.610 align:middle line:84%
to express that outwardly and
to get it out of your mind.

00:33:09.610 --> 00:33:12.608 align:middle line:84%
So I think writing can be
really helpful, to just

00:33:12.608 --> 00:33:13.650 align:middle line:90%
write those thoughts out.

00:33:13.650 --> 00:33:16.920 align:middle line:84%
And then that can help you
see how ridiculous they

00:33:16.920 --> 00:33:21.210 align:middle line:84%
are a little bit to get
them outside of yourself.

00:33:21.210 --> 00:33:24.810 align:middle line:84%
But also, I think
meditation is really just

00:33:24.810 --> 00:33:26.790 align:middle line:90%
such a crucial part of being--

00:33:26.790 --> 00:33:28.350 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Absolutely,
of calming it.

00:33:28.350 --> 00:33:29.150 align:middle line:90%
>>BREMNER: Yeah.

00:33:29.150 --> 00:33:33.840 align:middle line:84%
Learning how to simply breathe
and to tune into the body

00:33:33.840 --> 00:33:37.170 align:middle line:84%
and to what's actually
present with you in the moment

00:33:37.170 --> 00:33:39.300 align:middle line:84%
because all of these
stories and these loops

00:33:39.300 --> 00:33:41.310 align:middle line:84%
that we're running through
these mental loops,

00:33:41.310 --> 00:33:43.380 align:middle line:90%
they're not actually happening.

00:33:43.380 --> 00:33:44.680 align:middle line:90%
It's all in your mind.

00:33:44.680 --> 00:33:47.100 align:middle line:84%
So if you can just tune in
to what's actually present,

00:33:47.100 --> 00:33:50.710 align:middle line:84%
look at the physical world
around you, feel your body,

00:33:50.710 --> 00:33:55.470 align:middle line:84%
feel your energy, these things
can help us deactivate that.

00:33:55.470 --> 00:33:56.440 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: I agree.

00:33:56.440 --> 00:34:02.880 align:middle line:84%
And I think also another tool
is, if we go into the feeling

00:34:02.880 --> 00:34:07.850 align:middle line:84%
that we have where the monkey
mind and the loops are going,

00:34:07.850 --> 00:34:11.090 align:middle line:84%
there's something in us that's
getting something out of it.

00:34:11.090 --> 00:34:15.139 align:middle line:84%
And it's usually
something a little darker.

00:34:15.139 --> 00:34:18.650 align:middle line:84%
If we can stop ourselves for a
moment and when we're grinding

00:34:18.650 --> 00:34:22.219 align:middle line:84%
on this thought, think of where
is this taking us in our body

00:34:22.219 --> 00:34:25.699 align:middle line:84%
and in our emotions
and look at it and say,

00:34:25.699 --> 00:34:29.060 align:middle line:84%
I'm now in a habitual pattern
because some part of me

00:34:29.060 --> 00:34:31.680 align:middle line:84%
is being fed that's
liking this stuff.

00:34:31.680 --> 00:34:32.480 align:middle line:90%
>>BREMNER: Yeah.

00:34:32.480 --> 00:34:34.022 align:middle line:84%
And sometimes we
like to feel pain.

00:34:34.022 --> 00:34:35.480 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And we
want to feel pain.

00:34:35.480 --> 00:34:37.650 align:middle line:84%
And so to recognize
that and say,

00:34:37.650 --> 00:34:39.050 align:middle line:90%
do I want to keep feeling this?

00:34:39.050 --> 00:34:40.070 align:middle line:90%
>>BREMNER: Exactly.

00:34:40.070 --> 00:34:42.230 align:middle line:84%
But yeah, sometimes
that feeling of pain

00:34:42.230 --> 00:34:45.290 align:middle line:84%
is more familiar and more
comfortable than what it would

00:34:45.290 --> 00:34:46.730 align:middle line:90%
feel like to just be calm.

00:34:46.730 --> 00:34:47.840 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Exactly.

00:34:47.840 --> 00:34:49.159 align:middle line:90%
And so we get to keep to that.

00:34:49.159 --> 00:34:49.280 align:middle line:84%
>>BREMNER: And so we
get addicted to that.

00:34:49.280 --> 00:34:51.510 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Yeah, we get
addicted to those feelings.

00:34:51.510 --> 00:34:52.310 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

00:34:52.310 --> 00:34:53.300 align:middle line:90%
Very good.

00:34:53.300 --> 00:34:53.630 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:34:53.630 --> 00:34:54.139 align:middle line:90%
Here we go.

00:34:54.139 --> 00:34:55.639 align:middle line:84%
The lord of
utterance and justice

00:34:55.639 --> 00:34:57.290 align:middle line:84%
pierces the scales
of the crocodile.

00:34:57.290 --> 00:34:59.870 align:middle line:84%
This is called "The
Transfiguration of Thoth,

00:34:59.870 --> 00:35:01.310 align:middle line:90%
Squaring the Circle."

00:35:01.310 --> 00:35:02.750 align:middle line:90%
>>BREMNER: Yes.

00:35:02.750 --> 00:35:06.200 align:middle line:84%
This one has a lot of imagery
from Olympia, Washington, where

00:35:06.200 --> 00:35:09.140 align:middle line:84%
I lived, the Capitol Lake,
and the Capitol Building.

00:35:09.140 --> 00:35:13.280 align:middle line:84%
And I would spend hours
walking around that lake

00:35:13.280 --> 00:35:15.350 align:middle line:84%
and reflecting on
hermetic principles

00:35:15.350 --> 00:35:17.082 align:middle line:84%
and looking at the
sky and the water

00:35:17.082 --> 00:35:19.040 align:middle line:84%
and the reflections of
the above and the below.

00:35:19.040 --> 00:35:21.140 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Well, your earrings
right now, the ankh, which--

00:35:21.140 --> 00:35:21.940 align:middle line:90%
>>BREMNER:

00:35:21.940 --> 00:35:24.890 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: --is
featured prominently.

00:35:24.890 --> 00:35:26.960 align:middle line:84%
>>BREMNER: So, yeah,
that was born out

00:35:26.960 --> 00:35:28.520 align:middle line:90%
of that phase in my life.

00:35:28.520 --> 00:35:32.210 align:middle line:84%
And I wanted to do a
depiction of Thoth.

00:35:32.210 --> 00:35:35.030 align:middle line:84%
And I wanted to represent
him in the three

00:35:35.030 --> 00:35:39.140 align:middle line:84%
aspects of the Egyptian Thoth,
the Greek Hermes, and the Roman

00:35:39.140 --> 00:35:42.950 align:middle line:84%
Mercurius, but also to
make it a self-portrait

00:35:42.950 --> 00:35:47.360 align:middle line:84%
because I was forming a
relationship with this deity,

00:35:47.360 --> 00:35:50.750 align:middle line:84%
with this energy, and wanting
to experience it through my body

00:35:50.750 --> 00:35:52.650 align:middle line:90%
and through my own energy field.

00:35:52.650 --> 00:35:57.410 align:middle line:84%
And so that was what
happened with the painting.

00:35:57.410 --> 00:36:02.300 align:middle line:84%
Even though I initially wanted
to do a traditional portrait

00:36:02.300 --> 00:36:09.440 align:middle line:84%
of Thoth, it ended up being this
surreal spontaneous painting,

00:36:09.440 --> 00:36:13.430 align:middle line:84%
which was far more
effective in a magical sense

00:36:13.430 --> 00:36:16.400 align:middle line:84%
than if I had just done a
simple traditional portrait.

00:36:16.400 --> 00:36:17.870 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Yes, I
agree with that.

00:36:17.870 --> 00:36:18.980 align:middle line:90%
Very powerful.

00:36:18.980 --> 00:36:24.440 align:middle line:84%
And, again, very central to
hermeticism, this being who

00:36:24.440 --> 00:36:28.910 align:middle line:84%
is essentially the cosmic
archivist or scribe

00:36:28.910 --> 00:36:30.950 align:middle line:90%
for knowledge.

00:36:30.950 --> 00:36:32.480 align:middle line:84%
>>BREMNER: Yes,
the god of wisdom.

00:36:32.480 --> 00:36:32.960 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: That's right.

00:36:32.960 --> 00:36:33.760 align:middle line:90%
>>BREMNER: Yeah.

00:36:33.760 --> 00:36:34.970 align:middle line:90%
And all the sacred art.

00:36:34.970 --> 00:36:36.250 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:36:36.250 --> 00:36:37.050 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:36:37.050 --> 00:36:39.690 align:middle line:84%
Now we're here to the
gates of paradise.

00:36:39.690 --> 00:36:41.790 align:middle line:90%
Of course, everybody likes this.

00:36:41.790 --> 00:36:42.690 align:middle line:90%
Who doesn't?

00:36:42.690 --> 00:36:44.550 align:middle line:84%
The gates of paradise,
the two peacocks.

00:36:44.550 --> 00:36:48.150 align:middle line:84%
Tell us what this heaven and
Earth gates of paradise means.

00:36:48.150 --> 00:36:49.380 align:middle line:90%
We see gentility.

00:36:49.380 --> 00:36:51.180 align:middle line:90%
We see beauty.

00:36:51.180 --> 00:36:54.580 align:middle line:84%
We see the energy
rising, pointing upward.

00:36:54.580 --> 00:36:56.040 align:middle line:90%
Let's talk about that.

00:36:56.040 --> 00:36:58.230 align:middle line:84%
>>BREMNER: Well, it's a
very Venusian painting.

00:36:58.230 --> 00:37:01.350 align:middle line:84%
And it's centered
around the heart chakra.

00:37:01.350 --> 00:37:05.100 align:middle line:10%
And so all of the
plants and the herbs

00:37:05.100 --> 00:37:07.980 align:middle line:10%
incorporated in the painting all
have different correspondences

00:37:07.980 --> 00:37:09.900 align:middle line:10%
with the heart chakra
and with the heart

00:37:09.900 --> 00:37:15.320 align:middle line:10%
and with the circulatory
system, all different medicinal

00:37:15.320 --> 00:37:17.270 align:middle line:10%
and healing effects.

00:37:17.270 --> 00:37:22.930 align:middle line:10%
And so that painting, for me,
was about healing the heart

00:37:22.930 --> 00:37:25.990 align:middle line:10%
and opening the heart
and connecting the above

00:37:25.990 --> 00:37:29.230 align:middle line:10%
and the below through the heart
because the heart chakra is

00:37:29.230 --> 00:37:33.790 align:middle line:10%
the center point between the
upper chakras, which connect us

00:37:33.790 --> 00:37:35.830 align:middle line:10%
with our cosmic
source and the divine,

00:37:35.830 --> 00:37:37.540 align:middle line:10%
and the lower chakras
that connect us

00:37:37.540 --> 00:37:39.265 align:middle line:10%
with the body and
our physicality.

00:37:39.265 --> 00:37:41.140 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And where it
said the spark of life

00:37:41.140 --> 00:37:43.240 align:middle line:84%
exists, and when it
withdraws, we're dead.

00:37:43.240 --> 00:37:44.380 align:middle line:90%
>>BREMNER: Yeah.

00:37:44.380 --> 00:37:45.820 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: It's kind of simple.

00:37:45.820 --> 00:37:48.610 align:middle line:84%
That's the breath of life, the
center of the breath of life,

00:37:48.610 --> 00:37:50.530 align:middle line:90%
the anchor for the soul.

00:37:50.530 --> 00:37:51.330 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:37:51.330 --> 00:37:54.360 align:middle line:84%
Now when we go to plate
nine, it comes together.

00:37:54.360 --> 00:37:55.890 align:middle line:84%
We're talking about
the conjunction

00:37:55.890 --> 00:37:58.530 align:middle line:84%
of the sun and the moon
where the whole picture,

00:37:58.530 --> 00:38:00.900 align:middle line:84%
very in-your-face
literally, comes

00:38:00.900 --> 00:38:05.498 align:middle line:90%
together fierce and gentle.

00:38:05.498 --> 00:38:07.290 align:middle line:10%
>>BREMNER: Well, this
is an interesting one

00:38:07.290 --> 00:38:09.540 align:middle line:10%
because it's through
the lens of Jupiter,

00:38:09.540 --> 00:38:12.490 align:middle line:10%
but it's about the conjunction
of the sun and the moon.

00:38:12.490 --> 00:38:16.860 align:middle line:10%
So I think this conjunction of
the opposites-- the masculine,

00:38:16.860 --> 00:38:19.440 align:middle line:10%
the feminine,
positive, the negative,

00:38:19.440 --> 00:38:21.570 align:middle line:10%
the active and the passive--

00:38:21.570 --> 00:38:24.760 align:middle line:10%
they take place for all of the
different planetary energies.

00:38:24.760 --> 00:38:27.420 align:middle line:84%
And as we go through
life, we confront

00:38:27.420 --> 00:38:29.130 align:middle line:84%
these different
aspects of ourselves

00:38:29.130 --> 00:38:32.050 align:middle line:84%
and learn how to
bring them to balance.

00:38:32.050 --> 00:38:36.000 align:middle line:84%
And so, for me, that painting
was bringing Jupiter to balance

00:38:36.000 --> 00:38:40.110 align:middle line:84%
and finding that perfect
union of the expansive

00:38:40.110 --> 00:38:42.480 align:middle line:84%
and contracted
qualities of Jupiter

00:38:42.480 --> 00:38:45.330 align:middle line:84%
represented by the
lion and the unicorn.

00:38:45.330 --> 00:38:46.770 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Very powerful.

00:38:46.770 --> 00:38:49.410 align:middle line:84%
And the one thing I wanted
to talk to you about is--

00:38:49.410 --> 00:38:53.430 align:middle line:84%
your art, I mean, each piece
has its own emotional impact

00:38:53.430 --> 00:38:56.490 align:middle line:84%
on an individual looking
at it or mental impact,

00:38:56.490 --> 00:38:59.320 align:middle line:90%
either one, spiritual impact.

00:38:59.320 --> 00:39:04.020 align:middle line:84%
And you can find that you're
attracted or repulsed.

00:39:04.020 --> 00:39:06.570 align:middle line:84%
But let's talk about
something else entirely

00:39:06.570 --> 00:39:09.180 align:middle line:84%
because I'm seeing a
rise of it, and there

00:39:09.180 --> 00:39:11.980 align:middle line:84%
has been for a long
time, for decades now.

00:39:11.980 --> 00:39:21.300 align:middle line:84%
But a rise in what I consider
to be truly profane art and not

00:39:21.300 --> 00:39:23.880 align:middle line:84%
just asymmetry because
yours is very--

00:39:23.880 --> 00:39:25.200 align:middle line:90%
this is symmetrical.

00:39:25.200 --> 00:39:27.840 align:middle line:84%
Your art is always
representing both.

00:39:27.840 --> 00:39:29.010 align:middle line:90%
It's symmetrical.

00:39:29.010 --> 00:39:37.050 align:middle line:84%
And asymmetry and truly what
dark and most grotesque imagery

00:39:37.050 --> 00:39:40.020 align:middle line:84%
and such that's coming out of
the psyche right now through

00:39:40.020 --> 00:39:42.300 align:middle line:84%
a lot of artwork--
and it always has--

00:39:42.300 --> 00:39:43.950 align:middle line:84%
it just seems like
there's an abundance

00:39:43.950 --> 00:39:47.220 align:middle line:84%
of it right now even in some
of the-- a lot of the stuff

00:39:47.220 --> 00:39:49.020 align:middle line:84%
coming out of
Hollywood and films.

00:39:49.020 --> 00:39:53.370 align:middle line:84%
What happens when you put
asymmetrical grotesque art

00:39:53.370 --> 00:39:57.000 align:middle line:84%
out for the public even
though it's your own journey?

00:39:57.000 --> 00:39:59.880 align:middle line:90%


00:39:59.880 --> 00:40:04.130 align:middle line:84%
Which you have not
done here, by the way.

00:40:04.130 --> 00:40:08.590 align:middle line:84%
It has beauty within
it, within each theme.

00:40:08.590 --> 00:40:10.280 align:middle line:84%
>>BREMNER: I think
for some people,

00:40:10.280 --> 00:40:12.850 align:middle line:84%
it's really necessary
in a cathartic sense

00:40:12.850 --> 00:40:15.850 align:middle line:84%
to express that darkness
and to acknowledge it

00:40:15.850 --> 00:40:17.350 align:middle line:90%
and to give it form.

00:40:17.350 --> 00:40:19.720 align:middle line:84%
And I think it's also
therapeutic for others

00:40:19.720 --> 00:40:22.370 align:middle line:90%
to view it and to observe it.

00:40:22.370 --> 00:40:24.728 align:middle line:84%
So I don't necessarily
see that as--

00:40:24.728 --> 00:40:26.770 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: You don't have
any judgment around it--

00:40:26.770 --> 00:40:27.280 align:middle line:84%
>>BREMNER: No, I don't
have any judgment.

00:40:27.280 --> 00:40:28.238 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: --where I do.

00:40:28.238 --> 00:40:29.500 align:middle line:90%
Obviously, you can tell I do.

00:40:29.500 --> 00:40:30.310 align:middle line:90%
>>BREMNER: Yeah.

00:40:30.310 --> 00:40:34.240 align:middle line:84%
I mean, I think as
artists, we are charged

00:40:34.240 --> 00:40:38.620 align:middle line:90%
with inspiring and uplifting.

00:40:38.620 --> 00:40:43.570 align:middle line:84%
And, to me, as a hermeticist,
conveying divine principles

00:40:43.570 --> 00:40:44.950 align:middle line:90%
through the work that I do.

00:40:44.950 --> 00:40:48.610 align:middle line:84%
And I do it for myself,
but my ultimate hope

00:40:48.610 --> 00:40:50.860 align:middle line:84%
is that it's helpful
to other people,

00:40:50.860 --> 00:40:52.030 align:middle line:90%
that it's not just for me.

00:40:52.030 --> 00:40:52.510 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:40:52.510 --> 00:40:54.677 align:middle line:84%
And everybody has a right
to express what they wish.

00:40:54.677 --> 00:40:57.220 align:middle line:84%
And on that note,
here, you write,

00:40:57.220 --> 00:41:00.250 align:middle line:84%
"A magician is a master
of their divine will."

00:41:00.250 --> 00:41:03.220 align:middle line:90%
That's what a true magician is.

00:41:03.220 --> 00:41:10.440 align:middle line:84%
So the question is how to tap
into and listen to divine will.

00:41:10.440 --> 00:41:12.400 align:middle line:84%
We can't be a master
if we can't hear it.

00:41:12.400 --> 00:41:13.200 align:middle line:90%
>>BREMNER: Exactly.

00:41:13.200 --> 00:41:15.060 align:middle line:84%
So if you've got that
monkey mind rolling--

00:41:15.060 --> 00:41:15.380 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah, exactly.

00:41:15.380 --> 00:41:17.172 align:middle line:84%
>>BREMNER: --it's going
to be kind of hard.

00:41:17.172 --> 00:41:21.210 align:middle line:84%
So learning how to
invoke stillness

00:41:21.210 --> 00:41:23.700 align:middle line:84%
and to create space
within ourselves so

00:41:23.700 --> 00:41:27.000 align:middle line:84%
that divine aspect of
ourselves can inhabit our body

00:41:27.000 --> 00:41:28.110 align:middle line:90%
and can be there.

00:41:28.110 --> 00:41:29.820 align:middle line:84%
But so long as
we're all filled up

00:41:29.820 --> 00:41:32.610 align:middle line:84%
with these stories and
ideas about who we are

00:41:32.610 --> 00:41:34.710 align:middle line:84%
and how the world
is supposed to be,

00:41:34.710 --> 00:41:38.940 align:middle line:84%
that divine essence is going
to have a hard time expressing

00:41:38.940 --> 00:41:40.230 align:middle line:90%
itself within you.

00:41:40.230 --> 00:41:44.520 align:middle line:84%
So making space
within and helping

00:41:44.520 --> 00:41:47.430 align:middle line:84%
yourself to release
these stories

00:41:47.430 --> 00:41:48.870 align:middle line:90%
that we get so attached to.

00:41:48.870 --> 00:41:51.720 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Very well put
because it's as simple as that.

00:41:51.720 --> 00:41:54.510 align:middle line:84%
The fact is the subconscious
is there, it feeds itself,

00:41:54.510 --> 00:41:55.980 align:middle line:90%
and it's there to protect us.

00:41:55.980 --> 00:41:58.110 align:middle line:84%
Incarnation to
incarnation, it travels

00:41:58.110 --> 00:42:00.650 align:middle line:84%
with us with all the
experience that we've ever had.

00:42:00.650 --> 00:42:03.150 align:middle line:84%
So, of course, we're going to
see a thing that has harmed us

00:42:03.150 --> 00:42:04.470 align:middle line:90%
in the past and be fearful.

00:42:04.470 --> 00:42:05.970 align:middle line:84%
But we don't have
to tell ourselves

00:42:05.970 --> 00:42:09.720 align:middle line:84%
stories about it day after
day, lifetime after lifetime

00:42:09.720 --> 00:42:12.990 align:middle line:84%
because, in that where the
soul is trying to speak through

00:42:12.990 --> 00:42:15.450 align:middle line:84%
is much more subtle,
much more beautiful,

00:42:15.450 --> 00:42:18.150 align:middle line:84%
whispering through
all the time to us.

00:42:18.150 --> 00:42:22.360 align:middle line:84%
And yet, if all this has a
grip on us, we can't hear it.

00:42:22.360 --> 00:42:23.160 align:middle line:90%
>>BREMNER: Exactly.

00:42:23.160 --> 00:42:24.993 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So I think
you put it beautifully,

00:42:24.993 --> 00:42:27.370 align:middle line:84%
so being still enough
that we can hear it.

00:42:27.370 --> 00:42:30.060 align:middle line:84%
And the other thing is
expressing ourselves

00:42:30.060 --> 00:42:32.730 align:middle line:84%
artistically because a lot
of people think, oh yeah,

00:42:32.730 --> 00:42:37.440 align:middle line:84%
she can do that, she's talented,
I don't have any talent.

00:42:37.440 --> 00:42:41.820 align:middle line:84%
Talk about the value you see
in finding your way to art

00:42:41.820 --> 00:42:44.610 align:middle line:84%
even if you feel you
don't have talent.

00:42:44.610 --> 00:42:47.790 align:middle line:84%
>>BREMNER: Well, the way I
see it, we are all creators.

00:42:47.790 --> 00:42:50.320 align:middle line:84%
That is our gift as human
beings, each and every one

00:42:50.320 --> 00:42:51.120 align:middle line:90%
of us.

00:42:51.120 --> 00:42:56.340 align:middle line:84%
That doesn't necessarily mean
we're all going to be artists.

00:42:56.340 --> 00:42:59.130 align:middle line:84%
I think it's great if we can
find an artistic way to--

00:42:59.130 --> 00:42:59.580 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: If you can
pick up a crayon.

00:42:59.580 --> 00:43:00.360 align:middle line:90%
>>BREMNER: --express ourselves.

00:43:00.360 --> 00:43:00.810 align:middle line:90%
Exactly.

00:43:00.810 --> 00:43:01.600 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Draw a circle
and run through it.

00:43:01.600 --> 00:43:03.433 align:middle line:84%
>>BREMNER: We don't
have to do it for money.

00:43:03.433 --> 00:43:05.940 align:middle line:84%
We don't have to do it
for other people to see.

00:43:05.940 --> 00:43:10.470 align:middle line:84%
And we also don't have to make
physical visual art or music

00:43:10.470 --> 00:43:11.800 align:middle line:90%
or sculpture.

00:43:11.800 --> 00:43:14.370 align:middle line:10%
We can make our life
into a work of art.

00:43:14.370 --> 00:43:16.470 align:middle line:84%
We can be creative
about the way that we

00:43:16.470 --> 00:43:20.400 align:middle line:84%
live our life, about
that we arrange

00:43:20.400 --> 00:43:24.490 align:middle line:84%
all of the different aspects
of our life and relate to them.

00:43:24.490 --> 00:43:25.680 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: I agree with that.

00:43:25.680 --> 00:43:29.070 align:middle line:84%
And back to the
physical art, there

00:43:29.070 --> 00:43:32.070 align:middle line:84%
is something that happens in
his release, the Waldorf system.

00:43:32.070 --> 00:43:35.490 align:middle line:84%
I think Rudolf Steiner really
captured this a great deal

00:43:35.490 --> 00:43:39.780 align:middle line:84%
in his anthroposophical
educational system.

00:43:39.780 --> 00:43:41.610 align:middle line:90%
And that has to do with--

00:43:41.610 --> 00:43:42.810 align:middle line:90%
doesn't matter who you are.

00:43:42.810 --> 00:43:45.450 align:middle line:84%
When you draw a circle,
something is happening.

00:43:45.450 --> 00:43:48.630 align:middle line:84%
When you draw straight lines or
lines that cross or a square,

00:43:48.630 --> 00:43:50.850 align:middle line:84%
something is happening
within the being.

00:43:50.850 --> 00:43:56.430 align:middle line:84%
So I think it's worth it to pick
up a watercolor set or crayon

00:43:56.430 --> 00:43:58.800 align:middle line:84%
or whatever and just
let your hand doodle

00:43:58.800 --> 00:44:00.630 align:middle line:84%
and see where it
goes because it is

00:44:00.630 --> 00:44:03.120 align:middle line:84%
tapping into something
deeper that's

00:44:03.120 --> 00:44:06.033 align:middle line:90%
trying to express itself.

00:44:06.033 --> 00:44:07.950 align:middle line:84%
If it's really ugly,
just don't show it to me.

00:44:07.950 --> 00:44:09.532 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHTER]

00:44:09.532 --> 00:44:11.490 align:middle line:84%
>>BREMNER: We can learn
so much about ourselves

00:44:11.490 --> 00:44:13.710 align:middle line:84%
by just allowing that
expression to come through

00:44:13.710 --> 00:44:14.880 align:middle line:90%
without judgment.

00:44:14.880 --> 00:44:16.140 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Absolutely.

00:44:16.140 --> 00:44:19.290 align:middle line:84%
So when you were a little
kid, were you into daisies,

00:44:19.290 --> 00:44:20.392 align:middle line:90%
or did you do snakes?

00:44:20.392 --> 00:44:22.350 align:middle line:84%
What did you do when you
were a little kid when

00:44:22.350 --> 00:44:23.220 align:middle line:90%
you were doodling?

00:44:23.220 --> 00:44:25.012 align:middle line:84%
>>BREMNER: I really
liked to draw big cats.

00:44:25.012 --> 00:44:25.812 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah?

00:44:25.812 --> 00:44:26.670 align:middle line:10%
Oh, interesting.

00:44:26.670 --> 00:44:27.470 align:middle line:10%
>>BREMNER: Yeah.

00:44:27.470 --> 00:44:31.960 align:middle line:10%
Big cats, trees, the sun
and the moon, rivers.

00:44:31.960 --> 00:44:32.760 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Good.

00:44:32.760 --> 00:44:35.100 align:middle line:84%
Sometimes that helps us know
you a little bit better.

00:44:35.100 --> 00:44:36.000 align:middle line:90%
That's wonderful.

00:44:36.000 --> 00:44:39.100 align:middle line:84%
Well, you were definitely
born to do what you do.

00:44:39.100 --> 00:44:41.070 align:middle line:84%
And so thank you for
your due diligence.

00:44:41.070 --> 00:44:44.190 align:middle line:84%
And sorry you had to go
through such a tough dark night

00:44:44.190 --> 00:44:45.240 align:middle line:90%
of the soul to get there.

00:44:45.240 --> 00:44:47.640 align:middle line:84%
But it's been very
valuable for others

00:44:47.640 --> 00:44:49.205 align:middle line:90%
to see the expression of it.

00:44:49.205 --> 00:44:50.830 align:middle line:84%
>>BREMNER: And valuable
for me as well.

00:44:50.830 --> 00:44:51.870 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:44:51.870 --> 00:44:53.512 align:middle line:90%
Thank you so much, Seven.

00:44:53.512 --> 00:44:54.720 align:middle line:90%
>>BREMNER: Thank you, Regina.

00:44:54.720 --> 00:44:57.137 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: For those of you
looking to understand hermetics

00:44:57.137 --> 00:44:59.370 align:middle line:84%
more deeply, "Hermetic
Philosophy and Creative

00:44:59.370 --> 00:45:01.530 align:middle line:84%
Alchemy" would be
a wonderful place

00:45:01.530 --> 00:45:04.380 align:middle line:84%
to start, a great
course of study.

00:45:04.380 --> 00:45:06.450 align:middle line:10%
Until next time, thank
you for joining us here
