00:00:27.916 --> 00:00:30.290 align:middle line:10%
>> REGINA MEREDITH: Enrique
Villanueva is one of a number

00:00:30.290 --> 00:00:33.380 align:middle line:10%
of people from South America
who's been experiencing contact

00:00:33.380 --> 00:00:36.000 align:middle line:10%
with extraterrestrials
throughout his life.

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:38.950 align:middle line:84%
It began at the age of seven
and has taken him many years

00:00:38.950 --> 00:00:42.060 align:middle line:84%
to understand the true nature
of the experience, which he's

00:00:42.060 --> 00:00:43.420 align:middle line:90%
going to share with us today.

00:00:43.420 --> 00:00:45.970 align:middle line:84%
And wow, what a journey
for you, because you were

00:00:45.970 --> 00:00:48.110 align:middle line:90%
a curious little tyke, right?

00:00:48.110 --> 00:00:50.820 align:middle line:84%
From a very young
age, you were driven

00:00:50.820 --> 00:00:52.900 align:middle line:84%
to know the deeper
answers of life.

00:00:52.900 --> 00:00:54.890 align:middle line:84%
And that's really
the hallmark of a lot

00:00:54.890 --> 00:00:58.870 align:middle line:84%
of people that do end up
in an experience of contact

00:00:58.870 --> 00:01:01.180 align:middle line:84%
is that this is
their driving force.

00:01:01.180 --> 00:01:05.570 align:middle line:84%
Their soul's purpose in life
is to integrate this knowledge.

00:01:05.570 --> 00:01:08.290 align:middle line:84%
How do you feel
about that statement?

00:01:08.290 --> 00:01:10.460 align:middle line:10%
>> ENRIQUE VILLANUEVA:
Probably, he said yes.

00:01:10.460 --> 00:01:11.990 align:middle line:10%
I started when I was very young.

00:01:11.990 --> 00:01:14.530 align:middle line:10%
At seven I had my
first sightings.

00:01:14.530 --> 00:01:20.450 align:middle line:84%
Then around 12 I had
some astral projections.

00:01:20.450 --> 00:01:22.750 align:middle line:84%
And that really
ignite the curiosity

00:01:22.750 --> 00:01:26.020 align:middle line:84%
about the occult
side of reality.

00:01:26.020 --> 00:01:32.010 align:middle line:84%
Then at 17, I had some
very vivid experiences

00:01:32.010 --> 00:01:35.010 align:middle line:84%
in an astral projection
meaning beams

00:01:35.010 --> 00:01:38.690 align:middle line:84%
of light or-- I don't know,
that's what I called them.

00:01:38.690 --> 00:01:43.570 align:middle line:84%
And later, months
later, I get to be

00:01:43.570 --> 00:01:47.640 align:middle line:84%
part of the group Rahma, Rahma
mission, a group of contact.

00:01:47.640 --> 00:01:50.600 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: Yes, or the
people all had a very similar

00:01:50.600 --> 00:01:52.850 align:middle line:84%
disposition, interest,
and so forth.

00:01:52.850 --> 00:01:57.100 align:middle line:84%
But you also had a father who
was interested in these things.

00:01:57.100 --> 00:01:58.890 align:middle line:84%
As I recall your
father was a doctor?

00:01:58.890 --> 00:01:59.560 align:middle line:84%
>> VILLANUEVA: He
was, that's right.

00:01:59.560 --> 00:02:01.160 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: He was a
doctor, a surgeon.

00:02:01.160 --> 00:02:06.420 align:middle line:84%
And he belonged to various
esoteric organizations.

00:02:06.420 --> 00:02:09.280 align:middle line:84%
And let's talk about that part
of your life, your relationship

00:02:09.280 --> 00:02:11.540 align:middle line:84%
with your father and
when your father decided

00:02:11.540 --> 00:02:14.230 align:middle line:90%
to open the library to you.

00:02:14.230 --> 00:02:21.010 align:middle line:84%
>> VILLANUEVA: Well, when he
was a resident of medicine,

00:02:21.010 --> 00:02:25.212 align:middle line:84%
he had this experience
of astral production.

00:02:25.212 --> 00:02:26.670 align:middle line:84%
That was just
spontaneous for him--

00:02:26.670 --> 00:02:28.960 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: Astral projection,
just spontaneous-- OK.

00:02:28.960 --> 00:02:30.626 align:middle line:84%
>> VILLANUEVA: --coming
out of his body.

00:02:30.626 --> 00:02:33.610 align:middle line:84%
And what he told me
is he heard someone

00:02:33.610 --> 00:02:36.440 align:middle line:84%
knocking at the door, the place
he was living at the time.

00:02:36.440 --> 00:02:37.870 align:middle line:90%
He went down, opened the door.

00:02:37.870 --> 00:02:38.670 align:middle line:90%
No one was there.

00:02:38.670 --> 00:02:44.010 align:middle line:84%
When he came back, he noticed
his body was on the bed.

00:02:44.010 --> 00:02:44.810 align:middle line:90%
He was outside.

00:02:44.810 --> 00:02:46.250 align:middle line:90%
So he was in shock.

00:02:46.250 --> 00:02:47.050 align:middle line:90%
He cried.

00:02:47.050 --> 00:02:48.694 align:middle line:90%
He thought he was dead.

00:02:48.694 --> 00:02:50.110 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: He
thought he was dead.

00:02:50.110 --> 00:02:52.080 align:middle line:84%
Well that would-- if it
was spontaneous, yeah,

00:02:52.080 --> 00:02:53.913 align:middle line:84%
and you didn't know
about these things, that

00:02:53.913 --> 00:02:54.960 align:middle line:90%
would be disconcerting.

00:02:54.960 --> 00:02:57.590 align:middle line:84%
>> VILLANUEVA: And at the
time he was already married

00:02:57.590 --> 00:02:58.610 align:middle line:90%
to my mom.

00:02:58.610 --> 00:03:01.610 align:middle line:90%
He already had my big sister.

00:03:01.610 --> 00:03:06.100 align:middle line:84%
And he was really in shock,
thinking that that was the end.

00:03:06.100 --> 00:03:08.192 align:middle line:90%
So he cried and everything.

00:03:08.192 --> 00:03:12.980 align:middle line:84%
And later he says that
when it was the dawn,

00:03:12.980 --> 00:03:15.470 align:middle line:84%
he decided to try
to fit in the body.

00:03:15.470 --> 00:03:17.477 align:middle line:90%
So he sit in--

00:03:17.477 --> 00:03:19.060 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: Sit down
on top of himself.

00:03:19.060 --> 00:03:20.430 align:middle line:84%
>> VILLANUEVA: --and
repeat the same position.

00:03:20.430 --> 00:03:21.480 align:middle line:90%
He was on the bed.

00:03:21.480 --> 00:03:24.280 align:middle line:90%
And it seems that he much--

00:03:24.280 --> 00:03:27.200 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: So your father was
able to fit back into his body.

00:03:27.200 --> 00:03:29.260 align:middle line:84%
And then what happened
at that moment

00:03:29.260 --> 00:03:31.600 align:middle line:84%
when he discovered
he wasn't dead?

00:03:31.600 --> 00:03:33.940 align:middle line:84%
>> VILLANUEVA: He stand
up and he immediately went

00:03:33.940 --> 00:03:37.120 align:middle line:84%
to the faculty to meet
some of his mentors.

00:03:37.120 --> 00:03:39.950 align:middle line:84%
And happens to be
one of his mentors

00:03:39.950 --> 00:03:42.800 align:middle line:84%
told him that it was an
astral projection, that he was

00:03:42.800 --> 00:03:45.010 align:middle line:90%
part of the Rosicrucian order.

00:03:45.010 --> 00:03:48.560 align:middle line:84%
And he was the one that
initiated my father

00:03:48.560 --> 00:03:50.960 align:middle line:84%
into the practices
of the Rosicrucian.

00:03:50.960 --> 00:03:54.290 align:middle line:84%
From there he jumped
into the Masonic order.

00:03:54.290 --> 00:03:55.900 align:middle line:90%
He was part of the Gnostics.

00:03:55.900 --> 00:03:59.640 align:middle line:84%
And he had a big library
filled with those books.

00:03:59.640 --> 00:04:02.860 align:middle line:84%
So when I was born
the library was there.

00:04:02.860 --> 00:04:04.530 align:middle line:84%
I didn't touch the
library until I

00:04:04.530 --> 00:04:07.020 align:middle line:84%
was 12 when I started to
have these spontaneous astral

00:04:07.020 --> 00:04:08.440 align:middle line:90%
projections.

00:04:08.440 --> 00:04:10.300 align:middle line:84%
I thought it was part
of the changes you

00:04:10.300 --> 00:04:12.969 align:middle line:90%
experience through puberty.

00:04:12.969 --> 00:04:14.635 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: [INAUDIBLE]
out of your body,

00:04:14.635 --> 00:04:15.960 align:middle line:90%
hovering in the top of the room.

00:04:15.960 --> 00:04:18.418 align:middle line:84%
>> VILLANUEVA: They told me
there were going to be changes.

00:04:18.418 --> 00:04:20.710 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: You thought those
were part of your changes.

00:04:20.710 --> 00:04:21.543 align:middle line:90%
>> VILLANUEVA: Yeah.

00:04:21.543 --> 00:04:23.290 align:middle line:84%
I talked to my dad
and he says no, that's

00:04:23.290 --> 00:04:24.370 align:middle line:90%
an astral projection.

00:04:24.370 --> 00:04:25.340 align:middle line:90%
I had it too.

00:04:25.340 --> 00:04:29.320 align:middle line:84%
And you should try to do
it in a controlled manner.

00:04:29.320 --> 00:04:30.650 align:middle line:90%
So these are the books.

00:04:30.650 --> 00:04:33.310 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: Tell us a little
bit about your first astral

00:04:33.310 --> 00:04:36.250 align:middle line:84%
projections, what your
experience was as opposed

00:04:36.250 --> 00:04:37.050 align:middle line:90%
to your dad's.

00:04:37.050 --> 00:04:39.630 align:middle line:90%


00:04:39.630 --> 00:04:41.940 align:middle line:84%
>> VILLANUEVA: The first
time it was spontaneous.

00:04:41.940 --> 00:04:44.550 align:middle line:84%
I was sleeping, or
trying to sleep.

00:04:44.550 --> 00:04:46.480 align:middle line:90%
And it was very uncomfortable.

00:04:46.480 --> 00:04:49.660 align:middle line:84%
Suddenly, I was with my
pajamas standing in a street

00:04:49.660 --> 00:04:51.380 align:middle line:90%
that I didn't know.

00:04:51.380 --> 00:04:53.240 align:middle line:84%
And I was like, what
am I doing here?

00:04:53.240 --> 00:04:56.460 align:middle line:84%
And I walk around, look at
people, try to talk at them.

00:04:56.460 --> 00:04:57.490 align:middle line:90%
They didn't answer.

00:04:57.490 --> 00:04:59.810 align:middle line:84%
And I thought, this
must be a nightmare,

00:04:59.810 --> 00:05:02.790 align:middle line:84%
because I was in my
bed just a minute ago.

00:05:02.790 --> 00:05:06.740 align:middle line:84%
So I went to a garden I remember
and hide behind the bushes,

00:05:06.740 --> 00:05:08.410 align:middle line:84%
like someone was
going to look at me.

00:05:08.410 --> 00:05:10.837 align:middle line:84%
And I remember repeating to
myself, I have to wake up.

00:05:10.837 --> 00:05:11.670 align:middle line:90%
This is a nightmare.

00:05:11.670 --> 00:05:13.440 align:middle line:90%
I need to wake up.

00:05:13.440 --> 00:05:15.660 align:middle line:90%
And then I woke up in my bed.

00:05:15.660 --> 00:05:17.460 align:middle line:90%
And I was like, that was weird.

00:05:17.460 --> 00:05:19.502 align:middle line:84%
And then the next day,
the same experience.

00:05:19.502 --> 00:05:21.960 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: The same thing, you
were out on the same street,

00:05:21.960 --> 00:05:22.960 align:middle line:90%
or a different place?

00:05:22.960 --> 00:05:23.485 align:middle line:84%
>> VILLANUEVA: No,
different place.

00:05:23.485 --> 00:05:23.800 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Different place.

00:05:23.800 --> 00:05:24.000 align:middle line:84%
>> VILLANUEVA: But
the same thing.

00:05:24.000 --> 00:05:25.846 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: But no
one could see you?

00:05:25.846 --> 00:05:27.145 align:middle line:90%
>> VILLANUEVA: No one.

00:05:27.145 --> 00:05:30.320 align:middle line:90%
And then it happened.

00:05:30.320 --> 00:05:34.040 align:middle line:84%
I asked my dad and he told me
you should try some techniques.

00:05:34.040 --> 00:05:35.660 align:middle line:90%
And these are the books.

00:05:35.660 --> 00:05:38.630 align:middle line:90%
And I tried some of those.

00:05:38.630 --> 00:05:40.120 align:middle line:90%
Some really didn't work.

00:05:40.120 --> 00:05:42.100 align:middle line:84%
They were just
mumbo jumbo I guess.

00:05:42.100 --> 00:05:45.520 align:middle line:84%
But some were really
interesting techniques

00:05:45.520 --> 00:05:47.590 align:middle line:90%
to do that sort of projection.

00:05:47.590 --> 00:05:50.490 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: Which books
did you find to be useful,

00:05:50.490 --> 00:05:53.630 align:middle line:84%
if you can remember the
names of any of them?

00:05:53.630 --> 00:05:58.501 align:middle line:84%
>> VILLANUEVA: I remember
one of the Gnostic movement.

00:05:58.501 --> 00:06:02.830 align:middle line:90%
But it was in Spanish.

00:06:02.830 --> 00:06:05.675 align:middle line:84%
I think it was "The
Perfect Marriage."

00:06:05.675 --> 00:06:06.630 align:middle line:90%
That's it.

00:06:06.630 --> 00:06:08.326 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: "The
Perfect Marriage."

00:06:08.326 --> 00:06:09.700 align:middle line:84%
>> VILLANUEVA:
Yeah, translation.

00:06:09.700 --> 00:06:12.570 align:middle line:84%
In one of the chapters they
talk about this technique

00:06:12.570 --> 00:06:14.870 align:middle line:90%
of astral projection.

00:06:14.870 --> 00:06:18.270 align:middle line:84%
And I remember you
said, it didn't

00:06:18.270 --> 00:06:21.000 align:middle line:90%
happen the way the book says.

00:06:21.000 --> 00:06:23.044 align:middle line:84%
But what happened
to me is I woke up

00:06:23.044 --> 00:06:24.460 align:middle line:84%
in the middle of
the night feeling

00:06:24.460 --> 00:06:27.160 align:middle line:90%
my leg was hanging from the bed.

00:06:27.160 --> 00:06:29.740 align:middle line:84%
And then, because
I was so sleepy,

00:06:29.740 --> 00:06:34.800 align:middle line:84%
I let my whole being went
through the leg, and then out.

00:06:34.800 --> 00:06:36.725 align:middle line:90%
And I did it many times away.

00:06:36.725 --> 00:06:40.960 align:middle line:84%
All the times I
just feel so relaxed

00:06:40.960 --> 00:06:43.530 align:middle line:84%
that my body went to sleep
but my mind was awake.

00:06:43.530 --> 00:06:48.620 align:middle line:84%
And then I project an image
of myself, a blue body,

00:06:48.620 --> 00:06:50.640 align:middle line:84%
and I project my
consciousness in there.

00:06:50.640 --> 00:06:51.700 align:middle line:90%
And then I was inside.

00:06:51.700 --> 00:06:54.712 align:middle line:84%
And then I travel and do
whatever I want to do.

00:06:54.712 --> 00:06:56.920 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: So that's when
you started controlling it.

00:06:56.920 --> 00:06:57.700 align:middle line:90%
>> VILLANEUVA: Mm hmm.

00:06:57.700 --> 00:06:59.949 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: I remember having
one of these experiences.

00:06:59.949 --> 00:07:01.490 align:middle line:90%
My son was sleeping downstairs.

00:07:01.490 --> 00:07:03.390 align:middle line:84%
I was upstairs and
I heard a commotion

00:07:03.390 --> 00:07:05.890 align:middle line:84%
out in the street, which
was unusual because we

00:07:05.890 --> 00:07:07.640 align:middle line:90%
lived in a quiet place.

00:07:07.640 --> 00:07:10.030 align:middle line:84%
And I thought I had gotten
up, but of course it

00:07:10.030 --> 00:07:12.440 align:middle line:90%
was an astral projection.

00:07:12.440 --> 00:07:15.820 align:middle line:84%
But I went flying down
the stairs headfirst.

00:07:15.820 --> 00:07:18.680 align:middle line:84%
And when I landed in this space
where my son was sleeping,

00:07:18.680 --> 00:07:20.970 align:middle line:90%
I ended up upside down.

00:07:20.970 --> 00:07:22.830 align:middle line:84%
I was upside down
and I thought--

00:07:22.830 --> 00:07:24.121 align:middle line:90%
>> VILLANUEVA: It's weird, huh?

00:07:24.121 --> 00:07:28.440 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: --this is-- well, it
was only weird because my son

00:07:28.440 --> 00:07:29.340 align:middle line:90%
was doing the same.

00:07:29.340 --> 00:07:34.370 align:middle line:84%
He had lifted up out of his
body and was looking at me.

00:07:34.370 --> 00:07:37.240 align:middle line:84%
And I was embarrassed
that I was upside down.

00:07:37.240 --> 00:07:38.647 align:middle line:84%
And I thought, I
need to get back

00:07:38.647 --> 00:07:40.730 align:middle line:84%
and I need to get out of
here quickly because he's

00:07:40.730 --> 00:07:42.100 align:middle line:90%
watching me upside down.

00:07:42.100 --> 00:07:43.860 align:middle line:84%
So we were both
out of our bodies

00:07:43.860 --> 00:07:45.720 align:middle line:84%
having this experience
at the same time.

00:07:45.720 --> 00:07:46.615 align:middle line:84%
>> VILLANUEVA: In the
same frequency, yeah.

00:07:46.615 --> 00:07:48.490 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: Yeah,
it was interesting.

00:07:48.490 --> 00:07:51.592 align:middle line:84%
And I snapped back into my
body once I was embarrassed.

00:07:51.592 --> 00:07:53.300 align:middle line:84%
>> VILLANUEVA: Yeah,
those things happen.

00:07:53.300 --> 00:07:56.000 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: So these are ways in
which we probably have all had

00:07:56.000 --> 00:08:00.480 align:middle line:84%
these experiences, but
we think we're dreaming.

00:08:00.480 --> 00:08:02.230 align:middle line:84%
We're just not cognizant
they're happening

00:08:02.230 --> 00:08:03.810 align:middle line:90%
without our awareness.

00:08:03.810 --> 00:08:05.330 align:middle line:84%
And they're not in
a controlled way.

00:08:05.330 --> 00:08:07.930 align:middle line:84%
So you went to the trouble
to learn how to do this.

00:08:07.930 --> 00:08:11.160 align:middle line:84%
So how did you use your
ability to astral travel then

00:08:11.160 --> 00:08:14.056 align:middle line:90%
at that point in your life?

00:08:14.056 --> 00:08:15.430 align:middle line:84%
>> VILLANUEVA: I
remember for me,

00:08:15.430 --> 00:08:17.750 align:middle line:84%
the experience was I need to
make sure that this is not

00:08:17.750 --> 00:08:18.550 align:middle line:90%
a dream.

00:08:18.550 --> 00:08:21.370 align:middle line:90%
So I went around the block.

00:08:21.370 --> 00:08:24.850 align:middle line:84%
I remember going under one
tree and counting the flowers

00:08:24.850 --> 00:08:25.990 align:middle line:90%
in the bunch.

00:08:25.990 --> 00:08:27.880 align:middle line:84%
And then when I went
back to my body,

00:08:27.880 --> 00:08:33.204 align:middle line:84%
I ran to the park and check
and found the flowers again.

00:08:33.204 --> 00:08:35.370 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: So you were doing
it very scientifically.

00:08:35.370 --> 00:08:37.994 align:middle line:84%
>> VILLANUEVA: Yeah, I wanted to
make sure that it was not just

00:08:37.994 --> 00:08:39.059 align:middle line:90%
a dream.

00:08:39.059 --> 00:08:42.030 align:middle line:84%
But then the questions
remain, because OK, maybe

00:08:42.030 --> 00:08:44.470 align:middle line:90%
it was a mental projection.

00:08:44.470 --> 00:08:46.840 align:middle line:90%
But I felt like it was physical.

00:08:46.840 --> 00:08:50.690 align:middle line:84%
Another thing is my physicality
was not like this one.

00:08:50.690 --> 00:08:52.907 align:middle line:84%
I could stretch my
finger and pull it

00:08:52.907 --> 00:08:57.644 align:middle line:84%
like it was a noodle for
hours if I wanted, or float.

00:08:57.644 --> 00:08:59.060 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: Or pass
through things,

00:08:59.060 --> 00:09:01.048 align:middle line:84%
put your hand
through items, yes.

00:09:01.048 --> 00:09:04.360 align:middle line:84%
>> VILLANUEVA: Yes, and
travel long distances.

00:09:04.360 --> 00:09:06.860 align:middle line:84%
I sometimes believed I
traveled long distances.

00:09:06.860 --> 00:09:09.520 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: Where did you
try to project yourself?

00:09:09.520 --> 00:09:12.140 align:middle line:84%
What were you interested
in using this for?

00:09:12.140 --> 00:09:17.010 align:middle line:84%
>> VILLANUEVA: Once to Egypt--
I was curious about Egypt.

00:09:17.010 --> 00:09:20.540 align:middle line:84%
I always had the
pictures of the pyramids.

00:09:20.540 --> 00:09:22.650 align:middle line:84%
But that day I
arrived, and I noticed

00:09:22.650 --> 00:09:24.712 align:middle line:84%
there was a big city
close to the pyramids.

00:09:24.712 --> 00:09:25.670 align:middle line:90%
And I didn't know that.

00:09:25.670 --> 00:09:28.810 align:middle line:84%
And I saw the city and
I descend on the city,

00:09:28.810 --> 00:09:32.641 align:middle line:84%
walk between the people, see
the markets and the locals.

00:09:32.641 --> 00:09:33.640 align:middle line:90%
It was very interesting.

00:09:33.640 --> 00:09:35.230 align:middle line:84%
I was not into the
pyramids anymore.

00:09:35.230 --> 00:09:37.670 align:middle line:84%
I was into the people
and looking at the city.

00:09:37.670 --> 00:09:38.882 align:middle line:90%
I remember that one.

00:09:38.882 --> 00:09:41.530 align:middle line:90%
That was very vividly, yeah.

00:09:41.530 --> 00:09:43.850 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: But you had an
interest more in what we call

00:09:43.850 --> 00:09:48.800 align:middle line:84%
Egyptology, more the
sacred or spiritual aspects

00:09:48.800 --> 00:09:49.940 align:middle line:90%
of the pyramids.

00:09:49.940 --> 00:09:51.023 align:middle line:90%
>> VILLANUEVA: Definitely.

00:09:51.023 --> 00:09:53.640 align:middle line:84%
Yeah, I read in one
of my father's books

00:09:53.640 --> 00:09:56.350 align:middle line:84%
about the power of
the pyramids and how

00:09:56.350 --> 00:09:58.540 align:middle line:90%
they distort space and time.

00:09:58.540 --> 00:10:02.950 align:middle line:84%
And I wanted to know how was the
energy close to the pyramids.

00:10:02.950 --> 00:10:07.680 align:middle line:84%
In other times I project also,
but now inside to the pyramids.

00:10:07.680 --> 00:10:09.580 align:middle line:84%
Yeah, the energy is
definitely interesting.

00:10:09.580 --> 00:10:13.250 align:middle line:84%
But whenever I was close
to a field of energy that

00:10:13.250 --> 00:10:17.820 align:middle line:84%
was too strong, sometimes
it pushes me back

00:10:17.820 --> 00:10:19.770 align:middle line:90%
into my physical body.

00:10:19.770 --> 00:10:23.017 align:middle line:84%
And it happened to me that
time, the second time in Egypt.

00:10:23.017 --> 00:10:24.850 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: When you
were inside the pyramid?

00:10:24.850 --> 00:10:26.040 align:middle line:90%
>> VILLANUEVA: Yeah.

00:10:26.040 --> 00:10:32.250 align:middle line:84%
Then also whenever I want to use
this ability to scare someone,

00:10:32.250 --> 00:10:33.220 align:middle line:90%
let's say--

00:10:33.220 --> 00:10:35.040 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: You tried to
use it to scare someone?

00:10:35.040 --> 00:10:37.350 align:middle line:84%
>> VILLANUEVA: Yeah, a friend
of mine who was skeptical about

00:10:37.350 --> 00:10:38.150 align:middle line:90%
it.

00:10:38.150 --> 00:10:40.000 align:middle line:84%
And I said yeah, I can
go inside your house,

00:10:40.000 --> 00:10:41.360 align:middle line:90%
and blah, blah, blah.

00:10:41.360 --> 00:10:43.760 align:middle line:90%
And I did it once.

00:10:43.760 --> 00:10:45.760 align:middle line:90%
I saw them, the whole family.

00:10:45.760 --> 00:10:49.710 align:middle line:84%
But then when I mention it,
she was still skeptical.

00:10:49.710 --> 00:10:52.770 align:middle line:84%
So I said OK, I'm
going to do it tonight.

00:10:52.770 --> 00:10:56.330 align:middle line:84%
And when I tried to
do it that night,

00:10:56.330 --> 00:11:03.650 align:middle line:84%
when I was flying close to the
house, the sky became yellow,

00:11:03.650 --> 00:11:06.889 align:middle line:84%
and then I was pushed
back into my body.

00:11:06.889 --> 00:11:07.930 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Became yellow?

00:11:07.930 --> 00:11:09.346 align:middle line:84%
>> VILLANUEVA:
Became yellow, yes.

00:11:09.346 --> 00:11:14.940 align:middle line:84%
And then I noticed I'm back in
my-- somebody did this to me.

00:11:14.940 --> 00:11:18.280 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: So when you're
doing it as a party trick,

00:11:18.280 --> 00:11:19.972 align:middle line:90%
not responsibly.

00:11:19.972 --> 00:11:21.680 align:middle line:84%
>> VILLANUEVA: So I
tried to sleep again,

00:11:21.680 --> 00:11:23.100 align:middle line:90%
jumped from my body.

00:11:23.100 --> 00:11:26.700 align:middle line:84%
I was going to go anyways--
the yellow light again.

00:11:26.700 --> 00:11:27.624 align:middle line:90%
I was back in my body.

00:11:27.624 --> 00:11:29.040 align:middle line:84%
And I noticed, I'm
not in control.

00:11:29.040 --> 00:11:30.160 align:middle line:90%
Somebody is looking at me.

00:11:30.160 --> 00:11:31.162 align:middle line:90%
Somebody is watching me.

00:11:31.162 --> 00:11:33.620 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: Yeah, so that you
wouldn't start playing with it

00:11:33.620 --> 00:11:36.090 align:middle line:84%
and misusing it just to
prove something to someone.

00:11:36.090 --> 00:11:37.620 align:middle line:90%
It was for a bigger purpose.

00:11:37.620 --> 00:11:40.420 align:middle line:84%
OK, so that starts
giving us an idea

00:11:40.420 --> 00:11:42.540 align:middle line:84%
of who you were as a
kid, who your father was,

00:11:42.540 --> 00:11:44.110 align:middle line:90%
how this all came about.

00:11:44.110 --> 00:11:47.500 align:middle line:84%
And let's go a little
further into, now,

00:11:47.500 --> 00:11:52.450 align:middle line:84%
the original contact with other
beings and what that was like.

00:11:52.450 --> 00:11:54.400 align:middle line:84%
Because it's not
as though-- yeah,

00:11:54.400 --> 00:11:55.880 align:middle line:90%
you said you wanted to learn.

00:11:55.880 --> 00:11:57.660 align:middle line:90%
But you were actually afraid.

00:11:57.660 --> 00:11:59.300 align:middle line:84%
When it comes down
to it, most people

00:11:59.300 --> 00:12:01.520 align:middle line:84%
are, when they're
faced with the reality.

00:12:01.520 --> 00:12:04.360 align:middle line:84%
So let's talk about,
what, age 17-ish?

00:12:04.360 --> 00:12:08.100 align:middle line:84%
>> VILLANUEVA: Yeah, at 17 I
had this astral projection.

00:12:08.100 --> 00:12:12.480 align:middle line:84%
I was suddenly walking
in this desert.

00:12:12.480 --> 00:12:17.200 align:middle line:90%
And here was like a plane thing.

00:12:17.200 --> 00:12:20.090 align:middle line:84%
And at the horizon I
could see something

00:12:20.090 --> 00:12:22.870 align:middle line:90%
was breaking with the plane.

00:12:22.870 --> 00:12:24.630 align:middle line:90%
So I walked towards that thing.

00:12:24.630 --> 00:12:26.870 align:middle line:90%
And I noticed it was a tree.

00:12:26.870 --> 00:12:30.320 align:middle line:84%
That tree was
really ancient, old.

00:12:30.320 --> 00:12:32.090 align:middle line:90%
It didn't have any leaf.

00:12:32.090 --> 00:12:38.670 align:middle line:84%
And the cortex was so white,
like marble, like very old.

00:12:38.670 --> 00:12:41.570 align:middle line:84%
And there was light coming
from behind that tree.

00:12:41.570 --> 00:12:45.870 align:middle line:84%
So I walk around because it
was really, really big trunk.

00:12:45.870 --> 00:12:48.820 align:middle line:84%
And as I walk around, I
notice there was an elder

00:12:48.820 --> 00:12:50.270 align:middle line:90%
in the other side of the tree.

00:12:50.270 --> 00:12:51.477 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: An elder, OK.

00:12:51.477 --> 00:12:52.310 align:middle line:90%
>> VILLANUEVA: Yeah.

00:12:52.310 --> 00:12:56.680 align:middle line:84%
And there was a platform,
smaller than this one,

00:12:56.680 --> 00:13:01.070 align:middle line:84%
and on top of it a golden
book, made of, like,

00:13:01.070 --> 00:13:10.390 align:middle line:84%
metallic-- it's like
a book full of symbols

00:13:10.390 --> 00:13:12.490 align:middle line:84%
that I couldn't
understand at the moment.

00:13:12.490 --> 00:13:14.710 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: Were the symbols
metallic or the pages?

00:13:14.710 --> 00:13:16.400 align:middle line:84%
>> VILLANUEVA: The
pages metallic.

00:13:16.400 --> 00:13:19.550 align:middle line:84%
And the symbols were
inscripted on the pages.

00:13:19.550 --> 00:13:23.330 align:middle line:84%
And as I approached the
book, because the elder,

00:13:23.330 --> 00:13:26.030 align:middle line:84%
he smiled at me like I've
been waiting for you.

00:13:26.030 --> 00:13:27.070 align:middle line:90%
I felt that.

00:13:27.070 --> 00:13:29.900 align:middle line:84%
So he invited me to
get close to the book.

00:13:29.900 --> 00:13:30.800 align:middle line:90%
I approach it.

00:13:30.800 --> 00:13:31.740 align:middle line:90%
I look at it.

00:13:31.740 --> 00:13:34.100 align:middle line:84%
And I look at him like
I don't understand.

00:13:34.100 --> 00:13:36.510 align:middle line:90%
And he point at the book at him.

00:13:36.510 --> 00:13:38.790 align:middle line:84%
So I approach the
book with my hands.

00:13:38.790 --> 00:13:40.510 align:middle line:84%
And then I felt the
most weird thing.

00:13:40.510 --> 00:13:41.620 align:middle line:90%
The book was alive.

00:13:41.620 --> 00:13:45.130 align:middle line:84%
Somehow this thing
was alive like me.

00:13:45.130 --> 00:13:47.410 align:middle line:84%
And as I touch one
of the symbols,

00:13:47.410 --> 00:13:50.500 align:middle line:84%
I start seeing images
at very high speed.

00:13:50.500 --> 00:13:53.390 align:middle line:84%
And I think those were
images of our past,

00:13:53.390 --> 00:13:58.290 align:middle line:84%
and also images of whatever
was coming in our future.

00:13:58.290 --> 00:13:59.780 align:middle line:90%
And I was not afraid.

00:13:59.780 --> 00:14:03.940 align:middle line:84%
But I felt I was feeding
myself with this information.

00:14:03.940 --> 00:14:06.210 align:middle line:84%
And it was like I
was hungry for it.

00:14:06.210 --> 00:14:07.010 align:middle line:90%
I needed more.

00:14:07.010 --> 00:14:09.000 align:middle line:84%
So I passed the page
and tried to see more.

00:14:09.000 --> 00:14:12.380 align:middle line:84%
And my hands were like
reading, like braille reading,

00:14:12.380 --> 00:14:13.850 align:middle line:90%
like I was blind in a way.

00:14:13.850 --> 00:14:15.020 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: And you were
just continually downloaded,

00:14:15.020 --> 00:14:16.450 align:middle line:84%
downloaded with
more information.

00:14:16.450 --> 00:14:18.930 align:middle line:84%
>> VILLANUEVA: It was
kind of downloading, yes.

00:14:18.930 --> 00:14:20.860 align:middle line:90%
I was not learning something.

00:14:20.860 --> 00:14:23.220 align:middle line:90%
I was getting the information.

00:14:23.220 --> 00:14:25.410 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: It was like
being fed into your aura,

00:14:25.410 --> 00:14:26.700 align:middle line:90%
for lack of a better word.

00:14:26.700 --> 00:14:27.950 align:middle line:90%
>> VILLANUEVA: Let's say that.

00:14:27.950 --> 00:14:31.400 align:middle line:84%
And when I tried to
feed myself with more,

00:14:31.400 --> 00:14:35.230 align:middle line:84%
the elder put his hand on my
chest and just put me aside.

00:14:35.230 --> 00:14:37.810 align:middle line:84%
And I said no, I
need to know more.

00:14:37.810 --> 00:14:40.890 align:middle line:84%
And then he pointed at one
of the branches in the tree,

00:14:40.890 --> 00:14:43.030 align:middle line:90%
and there was a snake sleeping.

00:14:43.030 --> 00:14:48.814 align:middle line:84%
And for some reason I was very
afraid of that being awake.

00:14:48.814 --> 00:14:49.730 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: That snake?

00:14:49.730 --> 00:14:50.840 align:middle line:90%
>> VILLANUEVA: Yeah.

00:14:50.840 --> 00:14:56.920 align:middle line:84%
And then he told me, it's
like you have to wake up.

00:14:56.920 --> 00:14:58.570 align:middle line:84%
You have to take
people that is leaving

00:14:58.570 --> 00:15:00.290 align:middle line:90%
the shadow into the light.

00:15:00.290 --> 00:15:06.880 align:middle line:84%
You will find a way to transform
or to make light solid.

00:15:06.880 --> 00:15:08.560 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: A way to
make light solid--

00:15:08.560 --> 00:15:09.630 align:middle line:90%
>> VILLANUEVA: Yeah.

00:15:09.630 --> 00:15:11.671 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: --for the
transformation of others?

00:15:11.671 --> 00:15:13.670 align:middle line:84%
>> VILLANUEVA: It seems
that he was saying that.

00:15:13.670 --> 00:15:15.586 align:middle line:84%
But it was confusing to
me, very symbolically.

00:15:15.586 --> 00:15:16.997 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Well you were a kid.

00:15:16.997 --> 00:15:18.830 align:middle line:84%
>> VILLANUEVA: Yeah, I
was 17 at the moment.

00:15:18.830 --> 00:15:21.560 align:middle line:84%
And then I heard
someone yelling.

00:15:21.560 --> 00:15:24.350 align:middle line:84%
And I look around and
I couldn't see anybody.

00:15:24.350 --> 00:15:27.110 align:middle line:84%
But in my physical
room, my cousin

00:15:27.110 --> 00:15:29.770 align:middle line:84%
was sleeping in another
bed beside mine.

00:15:29.770 --> 00:15:32.090 align:middle line:84%
And she woke up to
go to the restrooms

00:15:32.090 --> 00:15:34.750 align:middle line:84%
when she noticed there
was these beam of light

00:15:34.750 --> 00:15:36.310 align:middle line:90%
sitting on my bed.

00:15:36.310 --> 00:15:37.600 align:middle line:90%
And she started yelling.

00:15:37.600 --> 00:15:40.050 align:middle line:90%
And then I woke up in my bed.

00:15:40.050 --> 00:15:44.080 align:middle line:84%
I saw this silhouette, a bright
silhouette beside my bed.

00:15:44.080 --> 00:15:46.130 align:middle line:84%
And then I closed my eyes
and I told her it's OK.

00:15:46.130 --> 00:15:46.930 align:middle line:90%
Everything is OK.

00:15:46.930 --> 00:15:47.330 align:middle line:90%
Don't worry.

00:15:47.330 --> 00:15:49.000 align:middle line:84%
But I didn't want
to see that I was

00:15:49.000 --> 00:15:51.450 align:middle line:84%
afraid of that
thing in my bedroom.

00:15:51.450 --> 00:15:52.250 align:middle line:90%
And then--

00:15:52.250 --> 00:15:53.791 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: But she
was seeing it too,

00:15:53.791 --> 00:15:55.070 align:middle line:90%
so that was very validating.

00:15:55.070 --> 00:15:55.920 align:middle line:90%
>> VILLANUEVA: Yeah.

00:15:55.920 --> 00:15:57.930 align:middle line:90%
For me it was validating.

00:15:57.930 --> 00:16:01.370 align:middle line:84%
And for the first time I
felt that the spirit world

00:16:01.370 --> 00:16:05.100 align:middle line:84%
realm and the physical were
touching, in an experience

00:16:05.100 --> 00:16:06.430 align:middle line:90%
where I have a witness.

00:16:06.430 --> 00:16:09.580 align:middle line:84%
And that for me, it was,
like, very powerful.

00:16:09.580 --> 00:16:11.630 align:middle line:84%
I thought if this
is happening, then

00:16:11.630 --> 00:16:14.580 align:middle line:84%
it can happen in
the future, maybe

00:16:14.580 --> 00:16:18.390 align:middle line:84%
in an even more
closer experience.

00:16:18.390 --> 00:16:22.570 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: OK, now after this,
when did you start having

00:16:22.570 --> 00:16:26.730 align:middle line:84%
your first contact with,
then, a physical reality?

00:16:26.730 --> 00:16:30.640 align:middle line:84%
You saw ships and such
when you were younger.

00:16:30.640 --> 00:16:33.950 align:middle line:84%
And a lot of people did,
actually, in this area.

00:16:33.950 --> 00:16:35.210 align:middle line:90%
You're from Lima, Peru--

00:16:35.210 --> 00:16:35.560 align:middle line:90%
>> VILLANUEVA: Yeah.

00:16:35.560 --> 00:16:36.470 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Right?

00:16:36.470 --> 00:16:40.440 align:middle line:84%
And let's talk about the next
level of that kind of contact.

00:16:40.440 --> 00:16:43.170 align:middle line:90%
>> VILLANUEVA: OK.

00:16:43.170 --> 00:16:45.710 align:middle line:84%
In another astral
projection, they told me

00:16:45.710 --> 00:16:47.870 align:middle line:90%
they were going to visit me.

00:16:47.870 --> 00:16:54.336 align:middle line:84%
And at the time, I didn't
approach the Rahma group.

00:16:54.336 --> 00:16:55.460 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: The Rahma group.

00:16:55.460 --> 00:16:56.580 align:middle line:84%
>> VILLANUEVA: The
group of contact.

00:16:56.580 --> 00:16:58.580 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: Hadn't you
already put a question out

00:16:58.580 --> 00:17:01.650 align:middle line:84%
to the universe and said, I
know I have friends out there.

00:17:01.650 --> 00:17:03.430 align:middle line:90%
I want to meet you.

00:17:03.430 --> 00:17:05.420 align:middle line:84%
Had you already done
that at this time?

00:17:05.420 --> 00:17:07.000 align:middle line:90%
I know I have friends.

00:17:07.000 --> 00:17:08.500 align:middle line:90%
>> VILLANUEVA: Yeah.

00:17:08.500 --> 00:17:10.869 align:middle line:84%
Because of my interest
in the teenage years,

00:17:10.869 --> 00:17:14.430 align:middle line:84%
I felt so different from
the kids of the block.

00:17:14.430 --> 00:17:16.940 align:middle line:84%
So I used to meditate
at the roof of my house.

00:17:16.940 --> 00:17:22.389 align:middle line:84%
And in my meditation, I asked
if anybody is, I don't know,

00:17:22.389 --> 00:17:24.569 align:middle line:84%
opening a channel
of communication,

00:17:24.569 --> 00:17:28.079 align:middle line:84%
and I'm interested in meeting
you guys if you are out there.

00:17:28.079 --> 00:17:31.110 align:middle line:84%
And I had this sightings
at very high altitude,

00:17:31.110 --> 00:17:33.990 align:middle line:84%
like lights coming and
then moving in zig-zag

00:17:33.990 --> 00:17:37.380 align:middle line:84%
and then continuing,
mostly very high.

00:17:37.380 --> 00:17:40.470 align:middle line:84%
But then I felt like
they're listening to me,

00:17:40.470 --> 00:17:44.590 align:middle line:84%
because every time I ask, I have
these movements come to me--

00:17:44.590 --> 00:17:48.140 align:middle line:84%
and then the dream about we
are going to visit you soon

00:17:48.140 --> 00:17:54.910 align:middle line:84%
And then one of those days in
the news, the Rama group, one

00:17:54.910 --> 00:17:56.856 align:middle line:84%
of the representatives
of the group

00:17:56.856 --> 00:17:58.230 align:middle line:84%
said that they
were going to have

00:17:58.230 --> 00:18:02.200 align:middle line:84%
a meeting with extraterrestrials
in the Chilca desert,

00:18:02.200 --> 00:18:04.990 align:middle line:84%
60 kilometers south
of the capitol.

00:18:04.990 --> 00:18:07.520 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: OK, so let's first
of all explain who the Rahma--

00:18:07.520 --> 00:18:09.590 align:middle line:90%
R-A-H-M-A-- group was.

00:18:09.590 --> 00:18:11.996 align:middle line:90%
Who constituted that group?

00:18:11.996 --> 00:18:16.040 align:middle line:84%
>> VILLANUEVA: Rahma is a group
of contact that started in 1974

00:18:16.040 --> 00:18:17.540 align:middle line:84%
with the experience
of two brothers,

00:18:17.540 --> 00:18:20.130 align:middle line:90%
Sixto and Charlie Paz Wells.

00:18:20.130 --> 00:18:24.890 align:middle line:84%
They, especially Sixto,
they opened their channel

00:18:24.890 --> 00:18:25.690 align:middle line:90%
spontaneously.

00:18:25.690 --> 00:18:30.150 align:middle line:84%
One day Sixto tried a
psychography, paper and pencil.

00:18:30.150 --> 00:18:31.260 align:middle line:90%
And he opened his mind.

00:18:31.260 --> 00:18:34.260 align:middle line:84%
He was doing this like a game,
like a Ouija board or something

00:18:34.260 --> 00:18:35.060 align:middle line:90%
like that--

00:18:35.060 --> 00:18:37.059 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: Yeah, that's
how it starts sometimes.

00:18:37.059 --> 00:18:39.440 align:middle line:84%
>> VILLANUEVA: --with his
sister and his mother.

00:18:39.440 --> 00:18:43.640 align:middle line:84%
And it seems that
he saw this being.

00:18:43.640 --> 00:18:46.810 align:middle line:84%
And then he
experienced the sound

00:18:46.810 --> 00:18:48.230 align:middle line:90%
of a voice inside of himself.

00:18:48.230 --> 00:18:50.620 align:middle line:84%
And he started writing
whatever he was saying.

00:18:50.620 --> 00:18:54.310 align:middle line:84%
And that was the first message
that said something like,

00:18:54.310 --> 00:18:57.030 align:middle line:84%
living room good to
start the communication.

00:18:57.030 --> 00:18:59.660 align:middle line:90%
I am Oxalc from Morlen.

00:18:59.660 --> 00:19:03.050 align:middle line:84%
You guys call it Ganymede,
one of the moons of Jupiter.

00:19:03.050 --> 00:19:05.230 align:middle line:90%
We can establish communication.

00:19:05.230 --> 00:19:08.180 align:middle line:84%
And that was the
first psychography

00:19:08.180 --> 00:19:10.520 align:middle line:90%
that they received in Rahma.

00:19:10.520 --> 00:19:13.380 align:middle line:84%
From there, Sixto was like
the antenna, the person

00:19:13.380 --> 00:19:14.670 align:middle line:90%
that is always receiving.

00:19:14.670 --> 00:19:17.790 align:middle line:84%
But I think his brother become
also an antenna, Charlie.

00:19:17.790 --> 00:19:21.690 align:middle line:84%
And then all the kids in the
block started meeting with him

00:19:21.690 --> 00:19:23.987 align:middle line:84%
and doing the practices
of opening the channel.

00:19:23.987 --> 00:19:26.570 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: Just like you he was
still very young at that time,

00:19:26.570 --> 00:19:26.940 align:middle line:90%
right?

00:19:26.940 --> 00:19:28.450 align:middle line:84%
>> VILLANUEVA: Yeah,
he was 18 years old--

00:19:28.450 --> 00:19:29.750 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: 18 years old, yeah.

00:19:29.750 --> 00:19:32.140 align:middle line:84%
>> VILLANUEVA: --and in
the same city, in Lima.

00:19:32.140 --> 00:19:33.520 align:middle line:90%
That was 1974.

00:19:33.520 --> 00:19:35.060 align:middle line:84%
I was 4 at the
time, so there was

00:19:35.060 --> 00:19:37.370 align:middle line:84%
no way I was going to be
participating of that.

00:19:37.370 --> 00:19:42.630 align:middle line:84%
And through them, through
Charlie and Sixto,

00:19:42.630 --> 00:19:45.980 align:middle line:84%
many people approached an
experience of contact in Lima.

00:19:45.980 --> 00:19:51.160 align:middle line:84%
And then the agencies, the
news agencies from Europe

00:19:51.160 --> 00:19:55.140 align:middle line:90%
send Juan Jose Benitez.

00:19:55.140 --> 00:19:58.450 align:middle line:84%
He's a very well-known
writer and ufologist.

00:19:58.450 --> 00:19:59.557 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: From Spain?

00:19:59.557 --> 00:20:00.640 align:middle line:90%
>> VILLANUEVA: From Spain.

00:20:00.640 --> 00:20:03.370 align:middle line:84%
At the time he didn't
have any interest in UFOs.

00:20:03.370 --> 00:20:06.860 align:middle line:84%
He just came for the curiosity
of this group of kids.

00:20:06.860 --> 00:20:08.720 align:middle line:90%
It's probably drug addicts.

00:20:08.720 --> 00:20:10.760 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: Drug addicts
making stuff up, yeah.

00:20:10.760 --> 00:20:11.350 align:middle line:84%
>> VILLANUEVA:
That's what he says.

00:20:11.350 --> 00:20:12.530 align:middle line:90%
He thought that.

00:20:12.530 --> 00:20:14.410 align:middle line:84%
Then Charlie
received this message

00:20:14.410 --> 00:20:18.120 align:middle line:84%
where the alien says, you
have to take this journalist

00:20:18.120 --> 00:20:20.510 align:middle line:84%
to the desert in that
day, at that hour

00:20:20.510 --> 00:20:24.910 align:middle line:84%
we will give the sighting so
he can have the proof of it.

00:20:24.910 --> 00:20:28.310 align:middle line:84%
So they took Juan Jose Benitez
to the desert, the Chilca

00:20:28.310 --> 00:20:29.300 align:middle line:90%
desert.

00:20:29.300 --> 00:20:33.000 align:middle line:84%
And he had the sightings,
two ships coming down

00:20:33.000 --> 00:20:36.070 align:middle line:84%
in between the clouds, because
it was very cloudy that day.

00:20:36.070 --> 00:20:36.910 align:middle line:90%
And he saw it.

00:20:36.910 --> 00:20:39.840 align:middle line:90%
And he went crazy.

00:20:39.840 --> 00:20:44.640 align:middle line:84%
He went back to Spain and
obviously made the articles

00:20:44.640 --> 00:20:45.440 align:middle line:90%
about it.

00:20:45.440 --> 00:20:47.700 align:middle line:84%
But I think he
wrote a book called

00:20:47.700 --> 00:20:50.570 align:middle line:90%
"UFOs-- SOS to Humankind."

00:20:50.570 --> 00:20:55.170 align:middle line:84%
And because of that book,
he got into so much trouble,

00:20:55.170 --> 00:20:59.551 align:middle line:84%
even went to court to protect
his image as a serious--

00:20:59.551 --> 00:21:00.467 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Journalist.

00:21:00.467 --> 00:21:02.970 align:middle line:84%
>> VILLANUEVA: [INAUDIBLE]
and journalist.

00:21:02.970 --> 00:21:04.780 align:middle line:84%
At the end, everything
was in his favor

00:21:04.780 --> 00:21:08.070 align:middle line:84%
and he started studying the
phenomenon really seriously.

00:21:08.070 --> 00:21:11.616 align:middle line:84%
But Rahma became a
sensation in Spain.

00:21:11.616 --> 00:21:15.390 align:middle line:84%
And through Spain,
into Europe also.

00:21:15.390 --> 00:21:19.160 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: And as for
Sixto and Charlie,

00:21:19.160 --> 00:21:21.360 align:middle line:84%
over the course of
the next decades,

00:21:21.360 --> 00:21:25.470 align:middle line:84%
weren't they able to go on board
the ship a number of times?

00:21:25.470 --> 00:21:27.460 align:middle line:84%
>> VILLANUEVA: Sixto
had reported it, yeah,

00:21:27.460 --> 00:21:30.610 align:middle line:84%
traveling with them,
and Charlie too.

00:21:30.610 --> 00:21:32.732 align:middle line:84%
Even Charlie has
weaknesses on one

00:21:32.732 --> 00:21:33.940 align:middle line:90%
of those physical encounters.

00:21:33.940 --> 00:21:37.710 align:middle line:84%
I think it was in Canada
just a few years ago.

00:21:37.710 --> 00:21:40.100 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: Yes, I
remembered what it was.

00:21:40.100 --> 00:21:43.640 align:middle line:84%
I was talking to you last
night, and I was invited to go.

00:21:43.640 --> 00:21:46.630 align:middle line:84%
There was supposed to be an
arranged meeting through Sixto.

00:21:46.630 --> 00:21:49.410 align:middle line:84%
And it was with Drunvalo--
Drunvalo who had invited me,

00:21:49.410 --> 00:21:50.322 align:middle line:90%
a man named Drunvalo.

00:21:50.322 --> 00:21:51.530 align:middle line:90%
I don't know if you know him.

00:21:51.530 --> 00:21:54.650 align:middle line:84%
And for some reason, of
course, at the last minute

00:21:54.650 --> 00:21:56.550 align:middle line:84%
everything fell apart
and it never happened.

00:21:56.550 --> 00:22:00.440 align:middle line:84%
But they did gather people
like that together to witness

00:22:00.440 --> 00:22:02.800 align:middle line:84%
this so they'd understand
it was a real phenomenon.

00:22:02.800 --> 00:22:05.920 align:middle line:84%
So many people actually
did either witness,

00:22:05.920 --> 00:22:07.800 align:middle line:84%
and some were able to
go on board the ships

00:22:07.800 --> 00:22:08.745 align:middle line:90%
through the years, right?

00:22:08.745 --> 00:22:10.510 align:middle line:84%
>> VILLANUEVA: Yeah, many
people that approach Rahma,

00:22:10.510 --> 00:22:11.770 align:middle line:90%
they have the sighting.

00:22:11.770 --> 00:22:14.570 align:middle line:84%
The sightings is the most
common thing in Rahma.

00:22:14.570 --> 00:22:16.520 align:middle line:84%
But then if you
practice with the group,

00:22:16.520 --> 00:22:19.310 align:middle line:84%
you will have the
training to confront

00:22:19.310 --> 00:22:23.160 align:middle line:84%
this reality of the contact
in a more closer encounter.

00:22:23.160 --> 00:22:25.880 align:middle line:90%
And that's what happened to me.

00:22:25.880 --> 00:22:28.940 align:middle line:84%
When I went first to
Rahma, it was sightings.

00:22:28.940 --> 00:22:33.540 align:middle line:84%
Then through meditation I felt
the closeness of these beings.

00:22:33.540 --> 00:22:35.910 align:middle line:84%
Then I had my first few
physical encounter with them.

00:22:35.910 --> 00:22:40.210 align:middle line:84%
And then it was
increasingly going-- yeah.

00:22:40.210 --> 00:22:44.700 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: But when it came
down to it and you did have

00:22:44.700 --> 00:22:47.090 align:middle line:84%
the opportunity to
go on board, right--

00:22:47.090 --> 00:22:49.280 align:middle line:84%
you were still quite
young at this time.

00:22:49.280 --> 00:22:53.671 align:middle line:84%
Tell us what happened
when it became real.

00:22:53.671 --> 00:22:55.920 align:middle line:84%
>> VILLANUEVA: You mean the
first time it became real?

00:22:55.920 --> 00:22:56.650 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Yeah, the first time.

00:22:56.650 --> 00:22:59.149 align:middle line:84%
>> VILLANUEVA: The first time
I was trying the psychography,

00:22:59.149 --> 00:23:01.480 align:middle line:90%
just like Sixto in 1974.

00:23:01.480 --> 00:23:04.300 align:middle line:84%
I was a new guy in
the Rahma group.

00:23:04.300 --> 00:23:07.320 align:middle line:84%
We were like 15 kids,
the new guys in Rahma.

00:23:07.320 --> 00:23:14.120 align:middle line:84%
And none of us seems to be
receiving the information

00:23:14.120 --> 00:23:15.790 align:middle line:90%
from these alien beings.

00:23:15.790 --> 00:23:18.140 align:middle line:84%
So I thought maybe if
I practice, maybe I

00:23:18.140 --> 00:23:20.930 align:middle line:84%
will open my channel of
communication, my telepathy.

00:23:20.930 --> 00:23:22.920 align:middle line:90%
So I try with paper and pen.

00:23:22.920 --> 00:23:26.360 align:middle line:84%
First night, nothing
happened at 11:00 PM.

00:23:26.360 --> 00:23:27.690 align:middle line:90%
Second night, nothing.

00:23:27.690 --> 00:23:31.400 align:middle line:84%
I just felt some energy and some
presence, but nothing special.

00:23:31.400 --> 00:23:33.890 align:middle line:84%
The third night
when I was trying,

00:23:33.890 --> 00:23:35.980 align:middle line:90%
I felt the energy, the presence.

00:23:35.980 --> 00:23:37.390 align:middle line:90%
I turned around, nothing.

00:23:37.390 --> 00:23:39.570 align:middle line:84%
When I closed my eyes,
I saw these hands

00:23:39.570 --> 00:23:41.600 align:middle line:84%
approaching from the
back, but so clear,

00:23:41.600 --> 00:23:45.500 align:middle line:84%
like I was looking at
them with my own eyes.

00:23:45.500 --> 00:23:47.420 align:middle line:90%
They approached from the back.

00:23:47.420 --> 00:23:51.360 align:middle line:84%
And then I feel the energy
coming from those hands

00:23:51.360 --> 00:23:53.980 align:middle line:84%
through my neck and
through my whole head.

00:23:53.980 --> 00:23:58.220 align:middle line:84%
And it was like a buzzing
sound, like [BUZZ].

00:23:58.220 --> 00:24:02.060 align:middle line:84%
The third buzzing sound created
an explosion in my forehead.

00:24:02.060 --> 00:24:03.340 align:middle line:90%
I saw a white.

00:24:03.340 --> 00:24:05.580 align:middle line:84%
I opened my eyes and
this being was standing

00:24:05.580 --> 00:24:07.090 align:middle line:90%
right there, where you are.

00:24:07.090 --> 00:24:08.100 align:middle line:90%
But he's standing.

00:24:08.100 --> 00:24:10.730 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: And tell us what
the being felt like and looked

00:24:10.730 --> 00:24:11.530 align:middle line:90%
like.

00:24:11.530 --> 00:24:14.620 align:middle line:90%


00:24:14.620 --> 00:24:19.030 align:middle line:84%
>> VILLANUEVA: He looked
like an Oriental person,

00:24:19.030 --> 00:24:20.720 align:middle line:90%
maybe like a Mongol.

00:24:20.720 --> 00:24:24.199 align:middle line:84%
See his eyes, big
but obviously--

00:24:24.199 --> 00:24:25.240 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Almond-shaped.

00:24:25.240 --> 00:24:26.910 align:middle line:90%
>> VILLANUEVA: --Oriental, yeah.

00:24:26.910 --> 00:24:33.210 align:middle line:84%
And his hair was long, close
to the shoulders, white.

00:24:33.210 --> 00:24:38.260 align:middle line:84%
And his chin was
like triangular.

00:24:38.260 --> 00:24:39.520 align:middle line:90%
But he was really beautiful.

00:24:39.520 --> 00:24:43.440 align:middle line:84%
I mean, his whole
features were beautiful.

00:24:43.440 --> 00:24:47.570 align:middle line:84%
And his body looked like a
person that was exercising,

00:24:47.570 --> 00:24:49.910 align:middle line:84%
goes to the gym, his
shoulders especially.

00:24:49.910 --> 00:24:52.250 align:middle line:84%
They were very round,
like a gymnastic.

00:24:52.250 --> 00:24:54.840 align:middle line:90%


00:24:54.840 --> 00:24:58.940 align:middle line:84%
And then his body was
covered with this kind

00:24:58.940 --> 00:25:05.740 align:middle line:84%
of like a tunic or robe,
very thin like silk almost.

00:25:05.740 --> 00:25:10.190 align:middle line:84%
But I could see his
form very clearly.

00:25:10.190 --> 00:25:13.630 align:middle line:84%
And around his whole
body, a bright light.

00:25:13.630 --> 00:25:14.430 align:middle line:90%
It was not an aura.

00:25:14.430 --> 00:25:17.150 align:middle line:84%
It was something
around his contour.

00:25:17.150 --> 00:25:18.940 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: His
silhouette of light.

00:25:18.940 --> 00:25:20.210 align:middle line:90%
And he was tall.

00:25:20.210 --> 00:25:21.335 align:middle line:90%
>> VILLANUEVA: He was tall.

00:25:21.335 --> 00:25:26.020 align:middle line:84%
Like let's say he was
6' 1 maybe or 6' 2.

00:25:26.020 --> 00:25:29.130 align:middle line:90%
And, well, he looked at me.

00:25:29.130 --> 00:25:30.935 align:middle line:84%
And I was in shock
because I was expecting

00:25:30.935 --> 00:25:32.550 align:middle line:90%
a voice in my mind, not a guy--

00:25:32.550 --> 00:25:33.300 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: Yeah,
standing in front of you.

00:25:33.300 --> 00:25:34.390 align:middle line:90%
>> VILLANUEVA: --in front of me.

00:25:34.390 --> 00:25:34.930 align:middle line:90%
So at the moment--

00:25:34.930 --> 00:25:36.530 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: So it brought
up a lot of fear.

00:25:36.530 --> 00:25:37.988 align:middle line:84%
>> VILLANUEVA:
Yeah, a lot of fear.

00:25:37.988 --> 00:25:40.180 align:middle line:84%
I didn't know if I
should run or just stay.

00:25:40.180 --> 00:25:43.050 align:middle line:84%
But I remember I wanted
to have the experience.

00:25:43.050 --> 00:25:45.257 align:middle line:84%
And now this guy
is in front of me.

00:25:45.257 --> 00:25:46.840 align:middle line:84%
But I have to break
the ice, because I

00:25:46.840 --> 00:25:50.630 align:middle line:84%
felt my heart literally
pulsating in my throat.

00:25:50.630 --> 00:25:52.040 align:middle line:90%
I was really scared.

00:25:52.040 --> 00:25:55.940 align:middle line:84%
And I remember telling him,
are you going to say something?

00:25:55.940 --> 00:25:58.220 align:middle line:84%
Are you going to dictate
something so I can write?

00:25:58.220 --> 00:26:01.420 align:middle line:90%
And he looked at me.

00:26:01.420 --> 00:26:04.930 align:middle line:84%
And then I felt this
energy coming from him.

00:26:04.930 --> 00:26:06.570 align:middle line:84%
I couldn't see
it, but I felt it,

00:26:06.570 --> 00:26:08.880 align:middle line:90%
like it was something tangible.

00:26:08.880 --> 00:26:11.520 align:middle line:90%
It came and embraced me.

00:26:11.520 --> 00:26:14.925 align:middle line:84%
And in that embrace, I
felt the love of a brother.

00:26:14.925 --> 00:26:19.040 align:middle line:84%
And my brain or my mind
translated that feeling

00:26:19.040 --> 00:26:20.420 align:middle line:90%
into little brother.

00:26:20.420 --> 00:26:23.500 align:middle line:84%
Like he was telling
me, little brother.

00:26:23.500 --> 00:26:29.340 align:middle line:84%
And then he keeps sending that
energy, that emotion, feeling,

00:26:29.340 --> 00:26:31.900 align:middle line:84%
and my mind keeps
translating everything.

00:26:31.900 --> 00:26:35.510 align:middle line:84%
That was like spontaneous,
like I knew how to do.

00:26:35.510 --> 00:26:38.290 align:middle line:84%
And he told me I
was going to need

00:26:38.290 --> 00:26:42.230 align:middle line:84%
to come down, because you are
not the antenna of the group.

00:26:42.230 --> 00:26:45.960 align:middle line:84%
And you need to go to
the group and explain

00:26:45.960 --> 00:26:49.430 align:middle line:84%
to your friends what were
you doing these nights.

00:26:49.430 --> 00:26:54.560 align:middle line:84%
And in between you
guys, they will come up,

00:26:54.560 --> 00:26:58.250 align:middle line:84%
the one that already
has the channel open.

00:26:58.250 --> 00:27:00.990 align:middle line:84%
And every time you
predispose yourself

00:27:00.990 --> 00:27:05.150 align:middle line:84%
in the service of the group,
we will be ready to assist you.

00:27:05.150 --> 00:27:07.670 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: Did he say anything
about where he was from?

00:27:07.670 --> 00:27:08.330 align:middle line:90%
>> VILLANUEVA: Nothing.

00:27:08.330 --> 00:27:09.288 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Nothing, OK.

00:27:09.288 --> 00:27:11.670 align:middle line:84%
>> VILLANUEVA: I had thousand
questions at the moment.

00:27:11.670 --> 00:27:13.020 align:middle line:10%
But when he was there--

00:27:13.020 --> 00:27:14.770 align:middle line:10%
>> REGINA: You were
too scared to ask him.

00:27:14.770 --> 00:27:15.780 align:middle line:90%
Yeah, I understand that.

00:27:15.780 --> 00:27:17.590 align:middle line:84%
>> VILLANUEVA: No, I
really tried to get

00:27:17.590 --> 00:27:18.830 align:middle line:90%
into the questions.

00:27:18.830 --> 00:27:20.630 align:middle line:90%
I couldn't remember any.

00:27:20.630 --> 00:27:22.110 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Oh, interesting.

00:27:22.110 --> 00:27:23.120 align:middle line:84%
The conscious mind
just kind of--

00:27:23.120 --> 00:27:24.328 align:middle line:90%
>> VILLANUEVA: What happened?

00:27:24.328 --> 00:27:25.290 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: --shut down.

00:27:25.290 --> 00:27:29.337 align:middle line:84%
OK, and so you went and told the
group, and they thought, right.

00:27:29.337 --> 00:27:31.795 align:middle line:84%
>> VILLANUEVA: Yeah, most of
the keys didn't pay attention.

00:27:31.795 --> 00:27:37.590 align:middle line:84%
But then Victor Benitez, one of
my friends of the group, Victor

00:27:37.590 --> 00:27:39.810 align:middle line:90%
was missing some of the classes.

00:27:39.810 --> 00:27:45.070 align:middle line:84%
And he was the most interest
guy that they-- and he told me,

00:27:45.070 --> 00:27:46.420 align:middle line:90%
what do you do?

00:27:46.420 --> 00:27:48.770 align:middle line:90%
How did it happen, and why?

00:27:48.770 --> 00:27:51.580 align:middle line:84%
And I just explained,
paper, pen, do this.

00:27:51.580 --> 00:27:55.330 align:middle line:84%
And I closed my eyes and I just
tried to get rid of any thought

00:27:55.330 --> 00:27:58.090 align:middle line:84%
and focus my whole
attention on my chest.

00:27:58.090 --> 00:28:02.690 align:middle line:84%
And then I grew in this
feeling of love and friendship

00:28:02.690 --> 00:28:03.530 align:middle line:90%
towards them.

00:28:03.530 --> 00:28:08.570 align:middle line:84%
And then I just shoot this beam
of light coming from my head

00:28:08.570 --> 00:28:12.610 align:middle line:84%
to the sky, and then I
open it in every direction

00:28:12.610 --> 00:28:15.940 align:middle line:84%
for whoever is open to
the communication with me.

00:28:15.940 --> 00:28:19.100 align:middle line:84%
I-- he did the same, and
days later he told me,

00:28:19.100 --> 00:28:20.680 align:middle line:90%
I cannot stop receiving.

00:28:20.680 --> 00:28:22.470 align:middle line:90%
My mind is very fast.

00:28:22.470 --> 00:28:25.460 align:middle line:84%
And even in the bars, he
was writing on napkins.

00:28:25.460 --> 00:28:26.260 align:middle line:90%
He couldn't stop--

00:28:26.260 --> 00:28:27.926 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: So it just
happening so fast.

00:28:27.926 --> 00:28:29.570 align:middle line:84%
Now were there girls
in the group too

00:28:29.570 --> 00:28:30.970 align:middle line:90%
or was this mostly boys?

00:28:30.970 --> 00:28:34.570 align:middle line:84%
>> VILLANUEVA: There were like
three girls in my group that I

00:28:34.570 --> 00:28:36.145 align:middle line:90%
started with, yeah.

00:28:36.145 --> 00:28:37.520 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: Yeah,
but interesting,

00:28:37.520 --> 00:28:38.950 align:middle line:90%
it was mostly young people.

00:28:38.950 --> 00:28:39.440 align:middle line:90%
>> VILLANUEVA: Mm hmm.

00:28:39.440 --> 00:28:40.240 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: OK.

00:28:40.240 --> 00:28:45.240 align:middle line:84%
And so as time went on,
you had other encounters.

00:28:45.240 --> 00:28:49.070 align:middle line:84%
And I would like to find
out about another one

00:28:49.070 --> 00:28:52.190 align:middle line:84%
and when you started
receiving what

00:28:52.190 --> 00:28:55.670 align:middle line:84%
it is they were wishing
to assist you with

00:28:55.670 --> 00:29:01.720 align:middle line:84%
and what you had agreed, on some
level, to assist humanity with.

00:29:01.720 --> 00:29:02.520 align:middle line:90%
>> VILLANUEVA: OK.

00:29:02.520 --> 00:29:06.230 align:middle line:90%


00:29:06.230 --> 00:29:10.870 align:middle line:84%
That was in September
2012, almost 20 years

00:29:10.870 --> 00:29:15.250 align:middle line:84%
after the last physical
encounter I had with them.

00:29:15.250 --> 00:29:19.250 align:middle line:84%
In those 20 years, I had
mental exchanges with them.

00:29:19.250 --> 00:29:21.930 align:middle line:84%
During meditation I saw
them and talked to them.

00:29:21.930 --> 00:29:26.590 align:middle line:84%
And that's something I can
take quietly and comfortably.

00:29:26.590 --> 00:29:28.270 align:middle line:84%
But then in September,
they invited

00:29:28.270 --> 00:29:30.470 align:middle line:90%
us to go to Mount Shasta.

00:29:30.470 --> 00:29:35.380 align:middle line:84%
And I was there with a group of
people, maybe like 20 people.

00:29:35.380 --> 00:29:38.610 align:middle line:84%
And they told us
that we were going

00:29:38.610 --> 00:29:43.446 align:middle line:84%
to have an experience on
the 21st and the 22nd.

00:29:43.446 --> 00:29:46.590 align:middle line:84%
And the 21st, everybody was
walking together that night.

00:29:46.590 --> 00:29:48.670 align:middle line:84%
And we had a
sighting at the time

00:29:48.670 --> 00:29:50.950 align:middle line:84%
they told us we were
going to have a sighting.

00:29:50.950 --> 00:29:53.540 align:middle line:84%
But then, some people
that we were not expecting

00:29:53.540 --> 00:29:54.970 align:middle line:90%
arrived to the place.

00:29:54.970 --> 00:29:57.740 align:middle line:84%
And that changes the
energy of the whole group.

00:29:57.740 --> 00:30:00.480 align:middle line:84%
So I thought maybe
nothing's going to happen.

00:30:00.480 --> 00:30:06.347 align:middle line:84%
Next morning, it was I think a
Sunday, everybody went hiking

00:30:06.347 --> 00:30:08.680 align:middle line:84%
very early in the morning,
because at 9:00 we were going

00:30:08.680 --> 00:30:10.570 align:middle line:90%
to meet to do some exercises.

00:30:10.570 --> 00:30:16.460 align:middle line:84%
So at 8:00 I went out and
walked between the forest.

00:30:16.460 --> 00:30:19.400 align:middle line:84%
And then I felt like-- it
was like being in love.

00:30:19.400 --> 00:30:22.230 align:middle line:84%
It's like an energy in your
chest that is calling you.

00:30:22.230 --> 00:30:24.420 align:middle line:84%
And I just keep
going up the hill.

00:30:24.420 --> 00:30:31.097 align:middle line:84%
And I went into this platform
surrounded by pine trees.

00:30:31.097 --> 00:30:32.180 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Little plateau.

00:30:32.180 --> 00:30:33.286 align:middle line:90%
>> VILLANUEVA: Yeah.

00:30:33.286 --> 00:30:35.186 align:middle line:90%
And I sit there.

00:30:35.186 --> 00:30:37.060 align:middle line:84%
And there was a tree,
like it was [INAUDIBLE]

00:30:37.060 --> 00:30:39.300 align:middle line:84%
and it was perfectly
like a chair.

00:30:39.300 --> 00:30:40.740 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: Sitting
on this stump.

00:30:40.740 --> 00:30:41.900 align:middle line:84%
>> VILLANUEVA: So I sat
there and I said I'm going

00:30:41.900 --> 00:30:43.240 align:middle line:90%
to meditate.

00:30:43.240 --> 00:30:48.860 align:middle line:84%
And as I was meditating, I
felt movement of people around

00:30:48.860 --> 00:30:50.710 align:middle line:90%
or somebody watching me.

00:30:50.710 --> 00:30:55.020 align:middle line:84%
So I opened my eyes and
looked, and at the distance,

00:30:55.020 --> 00:31:02.610 align:middle line:84%
in a hill that was maybe 60
meters away from where I was,

00:31:02.610 --> 00:31:05.770 align:middle line:84%
I saw these people
behind the trees.

00:31:05.770 --> 00:31:09.070 align:middle line:84%
It was like a group
of six, seven trees.

00:31:09.070 --> 00:31:10.940 align:middle line:84%
And people were
walking behind that.

00:31:10.940 --> 00:31:14.090 align:middle line:84%
And they were wearing
clothing like--

00:31:14.090 --> 00:31:17.260 align:middle line:84%
have you seen those people that
practice cycling, bicycles?

00:31:17.260 --> 00:31:18.060 align:middle line:90%
And they these--

00:31:18.060 --> 00:31:21.190 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: Skin, yeah, very
tight, skin-like suits.

00:31:21.190 --> 00:31:22.950 align:middle line:90%
>> VILLANUEVA: And it was white.

00:31:22.950 --> 00:31:26.050 align:middle line:84%
And I guess I was trying
to deny the possibility.

00:31:26.050 --> 00:31:28.510 align:middle line:84%
I thought probably they are
hikers or bikers from Shasta,

00:31:28.510 --> 00:31:29.310 align:middle line:90%
some of those kids.

00:31:29.310 --> 00:31:32.063 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: Usually they wouldn't
wear light skin type suits.

00:31:32.063 --> 00:31:35.120 align:middle line:84%
>> VILLANUEVA: Yeah, and the
kids in Shasta are also blonde

00:31:35.120 --> 00:31:35.920 align:middle line:90%
and everything.

00:31:35.920 --> 00:31:37.540 align:middle line:90%
These were blond.

00:31:37.540 --> 00:31:40.920 align:middle line:84%
And then one of
the group separates

00:31:40.920 --> 00:31:43.550 align:middle line:84%
and approached the
hill, looking at me

00:31:43.550 --> 00:31:45.540 align:middle line:90%
and put his hand like this.

00:31:45.540 --> 00:31:48.280 align:middle line:84%
And I saw him, and
immediately I knew.

00:31:48.280 --> 00:31:49.970 align:middle line:90%
And I was shaking at the moment.

00:31:49.970 --> 00:31:51.730 align:middle line:90%
Like no, I am not ready.

00:31:51.730 --> 00:31:54.310 align:middle line:84%
I was expecting the
experience with my group.

00:31:54.310 --> 00:31:55.110 align:middle line:90%
And I'm away--

00:31:55.110 --> 00:31:56.120 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: And you
were alone, yeah.

00:31:56.120 --> 00:31:57.536 align:middle line:84%
>> VILLANUEVA:
Yeah, again, alone,

00:31:57.536 --> 00:31:59.440 align:middle line:84%
every time I had
those experiences.

00:31:59.440 --> 00:32:04.370 align:middle line:84%
And I was like, I'm not
ready, but I know I cannot run

00:32:04.370 --> 00:32:05.170 align:middle line:90%
anymore.

00:32:05.170 --> 00:32:07.560 align:middle line:90%
So I just remained there.

00:32:07.560 --> 00:32:10.220 align:middle line:84%
And from the group
that was in the back,

00:32:10.220 --> 00:32:13.170 align:middle line:84%
a woman separate and started
walking down the hill.

00:32:13.170 --> 00:32:17.120 align:middle line:84%
And her physical form
was definitely a woman.

00:32:17.120 --> 00:32:19.560 align:middle line:90%
So she walked down the hill.

00:32:19.560 --> 00:32:23.140 align:middle line:84%
And then like in a 90
angle, she turned towards me

00:32:23.140 --> 00:32:24.690 align:middle line:90%
and said walking towards me.

00:32:24.690 --> 00:32:27.570 align:middle line:84%
And I could hear the
feet touching the ground

00:32:27.570 --> 00:32:31.540 align:middle line:84%
and breaking the little
limbs and the dry stuff.

00:32:31.540 --> 00:32:33.310 align:middle line:84%
But then I looked
at her when she

00:32:33.310 --> 00:32:36.909 align:middle line:84%
was, I don't know,
15 meters, and I

00:32:36.909 --> 00:32:39.200 align:middle line:84%
noticed her feet were actually
not touching the ground.

00:32:39.200 --> 00:32:40.440 align:middle line:90%
They were very close.

00:32:40.440 --> 00:32:42.480 align:middle line:90%
So what was I listening to?

00:32:42.480 --> 00:32:44.020 align:middle line:84%
I was really in
shock at the moment.

00:32:44.020 --> 00:32:47.860 align:middle line:84%
I closed my eyes and just,
with my back and close,

00:32:47.860 --> 00:32:51.060 align:middle line:84%
and just heard her
getting closer to me,

00:32:51.060 --> 00:32:52.940 align:middle line:90%
like she was in here.

00:32:52.940 --> 00:32:55.060 align:middle line:84%
But then I felt the
other one that was

00:32:55.060 --> 00:32:58.340 align:middle line:90%
standing there communicating.

00:32:58.340 --> 00:33:04.200 align:middle line:84%
And at that moment, that
was like a real download.

00:33:04.200 --> 00:33:06.570 align:middle line:84%
I don't know how long I
was in that situation,

00:33:06.570 --> 00:33:09.680 align:middle line:84%
but I know everything
he told me,

00:33:09.680 --> 00:33:12.490 align:middle line:84%
I had to dissect to
make it readable.

00:33:12.490 --> 00:33:13.740 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: To dissect it, yes.

00:33:13.740 --> 00:33:18.070 align:middle line:84%
>> VILLANUEVA: Because it was
like a bunch of information,

00:33:18.070 --> 00:33:19.250 align:middle line:90%
it was a package.

00:33:19.250 --> 00:33:23.580 align:middle line:84%
And it was about
humankind entering

00:33:23.580 --> 00:33:26.710 align:middle line:84%
what they call the fourth
dimension of consciousness.

00:33:26.710 --> 00:33:30.940 align:middle line:84%
And the whole thing was
symbolic because there

00:33:30.940 --> 00:33:37.290 align:middle line:84%
were two pine trees standing for
the place I enter that plateau.

00:33:37.290 --> 00:33:39.294 align:middle line:84%
And when I was going
to enter, I felt

00:33:39.294 --> 00:33:40.460 align:middle line:90%
there was something special.

00:33:40.460 --> 00:33:42.420 align:middle line:84%
And when I went
through those trees,

00:33:42.420 --> 00:33:44.410 align:middle line:90%
I felt the light different.

00:33:44.410 --> 00:33:47.230 align:middle line:84%
The light of the whole
place was different.

00:33:47.230 --> 00:33:51.040 align:middle line:84%
So he was explaining there was
a symbolic expression of what

00:33:51.040 --> 00:33:53.590 align:middle line:90%
was going on to humankind.

00:33:53.590 --> 00:33:57.920 align:middle line:84%
And I told him I was not
ready to live this by myself.

00:33:57.920 --> 00:34:00.110 align:middle line:84%
And he says, your
friends are with you.

00:34:00.110 --> 00:34:02.850 align:middle line:84%
And when you go back,
they will tell you

00:34:02.850 --> 00:34:06.450 align:middle line:84%
that they were already feeling
what was going on with you.

00:34:06.450 --> 00:34:08.880 align:middle line:84%
Because at a distance,
they were feeling

00:34:08.880 --> 00:34:12.020 align:middle line:84%
Enrique's having an experience,
and they didn't know why.

00:34:12.020 --> 00:34:18.120 align:middle line:84%
And then he showed me one
piece of archaeological stuff

00:34:18.120 --> 00:34:21.009 align:middle line:84%
is the god of the
sun in Tiwanaku.

00:34:21.009 --> 00:34:22.300 align:middle line:90%
I don't know if you have seen--

00:34:22.300 --> 00:34:23.980 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: I haven't
been to Tiwanaku.

00:34:23.980 --> 00:34:27.170 align:middle line:84%
>> VILLANUEVA: It's like
a portal in Bolivia close

00:34:27.170 --> 00:34:28.730 align:middle line:90%
to Titicaca lake.

00:34:28.730 --> 00:34:31.194 align:middle line:84%
I have never been in
that side specifically.

00:34:31.194 --> 00:34:33.860 align:middle line:84%
I've been in Bolivia,
but not in that place.

00:34:33.860 --> 00:34:37.040 align:middle line:84%
But when I saw this
thing in my mind,

00:34:37.040 --> 00:34:39.550 align:middle line:84%
I saw the whole explanation
he was giving me.

00:34:39.550 --> 00:34:45.929 align:middle line:84%
It was like through evolution
we went through many suns ages,

00:34:45.929 --> 00:34:48.389 align:middle line:84%
marked for activities
of the sun.

00:34:48.389 --> 00:34:51.449 align:middle line:84%
And now the sun was
changing its activity.

00:34:51.449 --> 00:34:55.270 align:middle line:84%
The energy we are receiving now
is creating a different kind

00:34:55.270 --> 00:34:56.989 align:middle line:90%
of consciousness.

00:34:56.989 --> 00:34:59.950 align:middle line:84%
It's like if you
cut and old tree,

00:34:59.950 --> 00:35:01.911 align:middle line:84%
and you know there's the
rings around the tree.

00:35:01.911 --> 00:35:03.160 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: All the rings, yes.

00:35:03.160 --> 00:35:06.300 align:middle line:84%
>> VILLANUEVA: The thicker rings
corresponds with a very high

00:35:06.300 --> 00:35:08.940 align:middle line:84%
activity of the
sun in that year.

00:35:08.940 --> 00:35:11.990 align:middle line:84%
Well let's say 2012 was
a very special moment

00:35:11.990 --> 00:35:15.680 align:middle line:84%
for the influence of this light
that is coming from the sun.

00:35:15.680 --> 00:35:16.680 align:middle line:90%
And it's not just light.

00:35:16.680 --> 00:35:17.940 align:middle line:90%
It's informational.

00:35:17.940 --> 00:35:20.100 align:middle line:84%
And it's information
that is [INAUDIBLE]

00:35:20.100 --> 00:35:23.235 align:middle line:84%
and our DNA is shifting
the whole way we're going

00:35:23.235 --> 00:35:25.080 align:middle line:90%
to see things in this planet.

00:35:25.080 --> 00:35:27.700 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: And I think that
it's probably good to point out

00:35:27.700 --> 00:35:34.000 align:middle line:84%
at this point that unless
one goes into some ancient

00:35:34.000 --> 00:35:36.750 align:middle line:84%
understandings, the nature of
the sun is not what we think it

00:35:36.750 --> 00:35:37.550 align:middle line:90%
is.

00:35:37.550 --> 00:35:41.120 align:middle line:84%
It isn't just a ball of light
to keep us warm and grow crops.

00:35:41.120 --> 00:35:46.450 align:middle line:84%
This is a being with--
multidimensional being

00:35:46.450 --> 00:35:48.575 align:middle line:84%
that serves this solar
system and beyond.

00:35:48.575 --> 00:35:49.950 align:middle line:84%
>> VILLANUEVA:
And not only that,

00:35:49.950 --> 00:35:53.600 align:middle line:84%
in all the symbolic expressions
of the sun, in every culture,

00:35:53.600 --> 00:35:56.090 align:middle line:84%
you see a sun that
is round, circular.

00:35:56.090 --> 00:35:59.870 align:middle line:84%
The one in the portal of the
Tiwanaku is actually square.

00:35:59.870 --> 00:36:02.710 align:middle line:84%
And it represents our entrance
into the fourth dimension

00:36:02.710 --> 00:36:03.510 align:middle line:90%
of consciousness.

00:36:03.510 --> 00:36:05.790 align:middle line:90%
That's why it's four angles.

00:36:05.790 --> 00:36:08.290 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: So there's a massive
amount of information coming

00:36:08.290 --> 00:36:12.490 align:middle line:84%
from this being, this entity,
that is programming this entire

00:36:12.490 --> 00:36:13.357 align:middle line:90%
system.

00:36:13.357 --> 00:36:14.190 align:middle line:90%
>> VILLANUEVA: Yeah.

00:36:14.190 --> 00:36:18.130 align:middle line:84%
And they told me the
evidence of this entrance

00:36:18.130 --> 00:36:21.400 align:middle line:84%
into the fourth
dimension will be,

00:36:21.400 --> 00:36:23.110 align:middle line:84%
you will recognize
this happening because

00:36:23.110 --> 00:36:26.260 align:middle line:84%
of the movement
of the population.

00:36:26.260 --> 00:36:28.590 align:middle line:84%
You will see upheavals
in consciousness

00:36:28.590 --> 00:36:31.647 align:middle line:84%
in Egypt, in Venezuela,
in many other countries.

00:36:31.647 --> 00:36:34.230 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: Oh, they told you all
of this prior to it happened?

00:36:34.230 --> 00:36:35.210 align:middle line:84%
>> VILLANUEVA: After it
happened, after, months later.

00:36:35.210 --> 00:36:36.970 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Right after, yeah.

00:36:36.970 --> 00:36:39.980 align:middle line:84%
>> VILLANUEVA: And they told
me that was a sign of how is

00:36:39.980 --> 00:36:43.440 align:middle line:84%
the collective consciousness
moving towards change.

00:36:43.440 --> 00:36:46.310 align:middle line:90%
And then--

00:36:46.310 --> 00:36:49.306 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: Tell us what else
you were shown at that time.

00:36:49.306 --> 00:36:53.440 align:middle line:84%
>> VILLANUEVA: That 33 is a very
important number in the Rahma

00:36:53.440 --> 00:36:55.830 align:middle line:84%
experience, in the
contact experience.

00:36:55.830 --> 00:37:01.400 align:middle line:84%
And 33 is also a very important
number in the religion

00:37:01.400 --> 00:37:03.150 align:middle line:90%
experience of the Andes.

00:37:03.150 --> 00:37:09.770 align:middle line:84%
The old religion, let's say
from the Incas, point at the 33

00:37:09.770 --> 00:37:12.652 align:middle line:84%
as the highest level in the
priesthood of the Incas.

00:37:12.652 --> 00:37:14.990 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: Same
as the Freemasons.

00:37:14.990 --> 00:37:19.910 align:middle line:84%
>> VILLANUEVA: And they say
that humankind is entering that

00:37:19.910 --> 00:37:22.840 align:middle line:84%
level, because when
we enter the 33,

00:37:22.840 --> 00:37:29.810 align:middle line:84%
we became part of a
collective that is in a space.

00:37:29.810 --> 00:37:33.790 align:middle line:84%
Let's say there is a white
brotherhood in a space.

00:37:33.790 --> 00:37:38.980 align:middle line:84%
They say that 32 ambassadors
from that brotherhood

00:37:38.980 --> 00:37:43.280 align:middle line:84%
came to Earth many thousands
of years ago to balance,

00:37:43.280 --> 00:37:45.327 align:middle line:84%
to create an equilibrium
in our planet.

00:37:45.327 --> 00:37:46.410 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: An equilibrium.

00:37:46.410 --> 00:37:48.750 align:middle line:84%
>> VILLANUEVA: The
33 representative,

00:37:48.750 --> 00:37:53.200 align:middle line:84%
the representative number
33 is actually humankind.

00:37:53.200 --> 00:37:55.920 align:middle line:84%
So we have to become
that, in that position.

00:37:55.920 --> 00:37:58.160 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: So the
whole story then,

00:37:58.160 --> 00:38:03.590 align:middle line:84%
the sun has begun projecting
that via its photons,

00:38:03.590 --> 00:38:07.520 align:middle line:84%
that information into our
solar system, into our species,

00:38:07.520 --> 00:38:09.469 align:middle line:84%
into all the other
species as well.

00:38:09.469 --> 00:38:11.260 align:middle line:84%
So theoretically we're
not the only species

00:38:11.260 --> 00:38:13.080 align:middle line:84%
that would be changing,
but this allows

00:38:13.080 --> 00:38:15.830 align:middle line:84%
us to rise up to that
level of consciousness

00:38:15.830 --> 00:38:19.130 align:middle line:84%
that we've all
been hearing about.

00:38:19.130 --> 00:38:20.980 align:middle line:84%
>> VILLANUEVA: And if
you see that portal,

00:38:20.980 --> 00:38:24.280 align:middle line:84%
you will see there
are lines of beings.

00:38:24.280 --> 00:38:29.200 align:middle line:84%
In the first line, this
is the Sun God, Viracocha,

00:38:29.200 --> 00:38:33.195 align:middle line:84%
and eight beings holding
a-- how do you call that?

00:38:33.195 --> 00:38:34.195 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Like a staff?

00:38:34.195 --> 00:38:35.790 align:middle line:90%
>> VILLANUEVA: Like a staff.

00:38:35.790 --> 00:38:37.420 align:middle line:84%
Eight beings here,
eight beings here.

00:38:37.420 --> 00:38:40.580 align:middle line:84%
Another eight that looks
like birds in the middle,

00:38:40.580 --> 00:38:43.800 align:middle line:84%
and another eight that looks
like people holding staffs

00:38:43.800 --> 00:38:44.600 align:middle line:90%
again.

00:38:44.600 --> 00:38:47.870 align:middle line:84%
So if you count the people,
they are actually 32.

00:38:47.870 --> 00:38:50.735 align:middle line:84%
And the being in the
center is the 33rd.

00:38:50.735 --> 00:38:52.610 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: And that
being is the central sun?

00:38:52.610 --> 00:38:53.660 align:middle line:90%
>> VILLANUEVA: Yeah.

00:38:53.660 --> 00:38:58.130 align:middle line:84%
And again, the line of
the birdlike creatures

00:38:58.130 --> 00:39:01.760 align:middle line:84%
holding the staff are
eight times two, 16.

00:39:01.760 --> 00:39:04.440 align:middle line:84%
And then at the bottom
you have 16 suns.

00:39:04.440 --> 00:39:07.570 align:middle line:90%
Again, 32 plus the god sun, 33.

00:39:07.570 --> 00:39:10.750 align:middle line:84%
So the 33 is there,
over and over,

00:39:10.750 --> 00:39:16.160 align:middle line:84%
repeating itself like we are
ready to enter for that jump.

00:39:16.160 --> 00:39:19.970 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: What other kinds of--
what did they show you besides

00:39:19.970 --> 00:39:22.270 align:middle line:84%
the disturbances that would
be taking on, the kinds

00:39:22.270 --> 00:39:25.060 align:middle line:84%
of revolution that would happen
in Egypt and other places that

00:39:25.060 --> 00:39:25.930 align:middle line:90%
did happen?

00:39:25.930 --> 00:39:28.230 align:middle line:84%
What other signs
did they show you

00:39:28.230 --> 00:39:32.540 align:middle line:84%
of institutions giving
way prior to this shift?

00:39:32.540 --> 00:39:38.140 align:middle line:84%
>> VILLANUEVA: OK, I basically
asked, at the moment,

00:39:38.140 --> 00:39:41.600 align:middle line:84%
if there was a possibility
of having sightings that are

00:39:41.600 --> 00:39:44.560 align:middle line:84%
massively-- or encounters
like the one I was having with

00:39:44.560 --> 00:39:47.640 align:middle line:90%
a group or whole population.

00:39:47.640 --> 00:39:50.610 align:middle line:84%
And he told me this is
the way things have been

00:39:50.610 --> 00:39:53.040 align:middle line:90%
going for thousands of years.

00:39:53.040 --> 00:39:54.760 align:middle line:84%
That is the policy
or the protocol

00:39:54.760 --> 00:39:56.680 align:middle line:90%
from the federation out there.

00:39:56.680 --> 00:40:02.030 align:middle line:84%
And they are going like
drops, water drops.

00:40:02.030 --> 00:40:03.970 align:middle line:90%
It's very slow, the process.

00:40:03.970 --> 00:40:06.800 align:middle line:84%
But the glass is
getting full already.

00:40:06.800 --> 00:40:10.060 align:middle line:84%
And as you expand
consciousness, the experiences

00:40:10.060 --> 00:40:15.720 align:middle line:84%
can become closer, but not
because of their interest,

00:40:15.720 --> 00:40:18.880 align:middle line:84%
but because we are jumping
into their reality.

00:40:18.880 --> 00:40:21.197 align:middle line:84%
So it's not about
them coming down.

00:40:21.197 --> 00:40:22.530 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: It's we're coming up.

00:40:22.530 --> 00:40:24.500 align:middle line:84%
>> VILLANUEVA: We have to
expand consciousness and jump

00:40:24.500 --> 00:40:26.291 align:middle line:84%
into the fourth dimension
of consciousness,

00:40:26.291 --> 00:40:29.284 align:middle line:84%
and then experience
the exchange with them.

00:40:29.284 --> 00:40:31.450 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: And they showed
you something about time,

00:40:31.450 --> 00:40:35.470 align:middle line:84%
how time and space operate,
including ourselves--

00:40:35.470 --> 00:40:39.330 align:middle line:84%
our past self, our present
self, our future selves,

00:40:39.330 --> 00:40:43.140 align:middle line:84%
and the differences in the
way time appears to move even

00:40:43.140 --> 00:40:43.940 align:middle line:90%
in these.

00:40:43.940 --> 00:40:45.330 align:middle line:90%
Can you explain some of this?

00:40:45.330 --> 00:40:49.050 align:middle line:84%
Because you do
work with clients,

00:40:49.050 --> 00:40:52.286 align:middle line:84%
and you also have a
site, Spanish speaking,

00:40:52.286 --> 00:40:53.660 align:middle line:84%
where you have
many, many videos,

00:40:53.660 --> 00:40:55.790 align:middle line:84%
and you have guided
people, successfully,

00:40:55.790 --> 00:40:57.850 align:middle line:84%
through this process
of connecting

00:40:57.850 --> 00:41:00.940 align:middle line:84%
with future self and past self
to heal things, many times.

00:41:00.940 --> 00:41:05.410 align:middle line:84%
Can you talk a little bit about
the nature of nonlinear selves?

00:41:05.410 --> 00:41:07.430 align:middle line:90%
>> VILLANUEVA: Yeah.

00:41:07.430 --> 00:41:10.750 align:middle line:84%
At that experience
in 2012, they told me

00:41:10.750 --> 00:41:15.720 align:middle line:84%
that time, from our perspective,
is like a rubber band.

00:41:15.720 --> 00:41:18.160 align:middle line:84%
And so as we enter into
the fourth dimension,

00:41:18.160 --> 00:41:20.600 align:middle line:84%
it's like we pull the
rubber band and let go,

00:41:20.600 --> 00:41:23.510 align:middle line:84%
and then the thing is going
one side and the other side

00:41:23.510 --> 00:41:24.860 align:middle line:90%
until it is stabilized.

00:41:24.860 --> 00:41:29.200 align:middle line:84%
And that whole movement can
take thousands of years.

00:41:29.200 --> 00:41:32.830 align:middle line:84%
So the fact that we enter
the fourth dimension is not

00:41:32.830 --> 00:41:35.106 align:middle line:84%
like the whole humankind
is enlightened already,

00:41:35.106 --> 00:41:38.920 align:middle line:84%
but we have the potential to--
we already entered that realm,

00:41:38.920 --> 00:41:41.930 align:middle line:84%
and we just need to
realize we are here.

00:41:41.930 --> 00:41:46.800 align:middle line:84%
And we have other
tools to work with.

00:41:46.800 --> 00:41:50.690 align:middle line:84%
And that is not only happening
to the human species,

00:41:50.690 --> 00:41:52.390 align:middle line:84%
it's happening to
all the species.

00:41:52.390 --> 00:41:55.510 align:middle line:84%
Because as we enter into
the fourth dimension,

00:41:55.510 --> 00:41:58.480 align:middle line:84%
the animals enter the third
dimension of consciousness.

00:41:58.480 --> 00:42:01.440 align:middle line:84%
So you will notice more
and more animals behaving

00:42:01.440 --> 00:42:03.100 align:middle line:90%
like humans used to behave.

00:42:03.100 --> 00:42:05.100 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: OK, I want to
ask you something here.

00:42:05.100 --> 00:42:08.090 align:middle line:84%
I'm just injecting this and
then I want you to continue on.

00:42:08.090 --> 00:42:13.040 align:middle line:84%
I've had kind of a feeling
about all of the suddenly

00:42:13.040 --> 00:42:15.640 align:middle line:90%
disappearing species.

00:42:15.640 --> 00:42:18.560 align:middle line:84%
And my thought on it
was that as the planet

00:42:18.560 --> 00:42:22.270 align:middle line:84%
is changing these frequencies,
that some of the species

00:42:22.270 --> 00:42:26.400 align:middle line:84%
continue on, as you say, and
gain in their own intelligence.

00:42:26.400 --> 00:42:28.112 align:middle line:84%
But others actually
disappear and stay

00:42:28.112 --> 00:42:30.070 align:middle line:84%
with the old frequencies,
and they're literally

00:42:30.070 --> 00:42:31.033 align:middle line:90%
gone from view.

00:42:31.033 --> 00:42:33.300 align:middle line:84%
It's almost right here,
we just can't see them,

00:42:33.300 --> 00:42:35.730 align:middle line:90%
just like the astral realms.

00:42:35.730 --> 00:42:37.815 align:middle line:84%
Does that ring true
at all for you?

00:42:37.815 --> 00:42:39.940 align:middle line:84%
>> VILLANUEVA: It is possible
that they are jumping

00:42:39.940 --> 00:42:41.510 align:middle line:90%
into another reality, yeah.

00:42:41.510 --> 00:42:42.565 align:middle line:90%
We call it extinction.

00:42:42.565 --> 00:42:43.940 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: We call
it extinction,

00:42:43.940 --> 00:42:45.310 align:middle line:90%
but that's not what I see it as.

00:42:45.310 --> 00:42:47.420 align:middle line:84%
I see it as just
disappearing from our view.

00:42:47.420 --> 00:42:49.180 align:middle line:84%
>> VILLANUEVA: I
see evolution here.

00:42:49.180 --> 00:42:52.430 align:middle line:84%
And I see that some of those
species didn't even disappear,

00:42:52.430 --> 00:42:54.300 align:middle line:90%
they just mutate.

00:42:54.300 --> 00:42:55.500 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Interesting.

00:42:55.500 --> 00:42:57.570 align:middle line:84%
>> VILLANUEVA: You can
see the [INAUDIBLE].

00:42:57.570 --> 00:43:01.160 align:middle line:84%
This is a frog that was taken
into Australia to get rid

00:43:01.160 --> 00:43:03.900 align:middle line:90%
of the plagues, the insects.

00:43:03.900 --> 00:43:06.460 align:middle line:84%
The blue frog had big
legs, so he jumped

00:43:06.460 --> 00:43:07.990 align:middle line:90%
and spread all over the place.

00:43:07.990 --> 00:43:12.780 align:middle line:84%
And he kills the
plague, the insects.

00:43:12.780 --> 00:43:20.390 align:middle line:84%
But also the local snakes
couldn't eat that huge frog.

00:43:20.390 --> 00:43:23.050 align:middle line:84%
And what happened is
in the next 50 years,

00:43:23.050 --> 00:43:27.480 align:middle line:84%
this snake developed
a bigger mandible

00:43:27.480 --> 00:43:30.490 align:middle line:84%
in order to swallow the
thing-- just 50 years.

00:43:30.490 --> 00:43:31.490 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: That's quick.

00:43:31.490 --> 00:43:33.948 align:middle line:84%
>> VILLANUEVA: So evolution is
going really fast right now.

00:43:33.948 --> 00:43:35.710 align:middle line:84%
And that's happening
with every species.

00:43:35.710 --> 00:43:38.386 align:middle line:90%
And we are not an exception.

00:43:38.386 --> 00:43:40.855 align:middle line:84%
Even Bruce Lahn-- this
is a scientist from--

00:43:40.855 --> 00:43:42.230 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: What's
his name again?

00:43:42.230 --> 00:43:43.270 align:middle line:90%
>> VILLANUEVA: Bruce Lahn.

00:43:43.270 --> 00:43:44.186 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Bruce Lahn.

00:43:44.186 --> 00:43:48.140 align:middle line:84%
>> VILLANUEVA: He is a doctor
in genetics I think from Chicago

00:43:48.140 --> 00:43:49.440 align:middle line:90%
University.

00:43:49.440 --> 00:43:52.470 align:middle line:84%
And he talks about
how we are triggering

00:43:52.470 --> 00:43:57.320 align:middle line:84%
the awakening of two genes
that were sleeping in humankind

00:43:57.320 --> 00:43:58.864 align:middle line:90%
for the last 100,000 years.

00:43:58.864 --> 00:44:01.030 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: And what are
those genes responsible for?

00:44:01.030 --> 00:44:02.140 align:middle line:84%
Or how would they
show themselves?

00:44:02.140 --> 00:44:04.431 align:middle line:84%
>> VILLANUEVA: It seems that
when they appeared 100,000

00:44:04.431 --> 00:44:07.620 align:middle line:90%
years ago, our brain grew up.

00:44:07.620 --> 00:44:10.020 align:middle line:90%
So now they are active again.

00:44:10.020 --> 00:44:12.450 align:middle line:84%
And so something is going to
happen to our nervous system

00:44:12.450 --> 00:44:13.250 align:middle line:90%
right now.

00:44:13.250 --> 00:44:14.450 align:middle line:90%
It's happening already.

00:44:14.450 --> 00:44:16.100 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: And did they say what
those characteristics would be,

00:44:16.100 --> 00:44:17.720 align:middle line:90%
how it would affect us?

00:44:17.720 --> 00:44:19.980 align:middle line:84%
>> VILLANUEVA: No,
this is-- we are--

00:44:19.980 --> 00:44:20.230 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: We'll find out.

00:44:20.230 --> 00:44:22.355 align:middle line:84%
>> VILLANUEVA: We're going
to have to explain this,

00:44:22.355 --> 00:44:24.530 align:middle line:84%
but now the time
definitely is changing.

00:44:24.530 --> 00:44:27.030 align:middle line:90%
And now we can work with time.

00:44:27.030 --> 00:44:28.370 align:middle line:90%
That's what I feel now.

00:44:28.370 --> 00:44:29.680 align:middle line:90%
I am in the field of therapy.

00:44:29.680 --> 00:44:31.700 align:middle line:90%
I am a hypnotherapist.

00:44:31.700 --> 00:44:34.190 align:middle line:84%
So I apply different
modalities with my clients.

00:44:34.190 --> 00:44:38.430 align:middle line:84%
But then I have, let's say,
channeled this modality

00:44:38.430 --> 00:44:41.360 align:middle line:90%
that is called REM healing.

00:44:41.360 --> 00:44:43.912 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: REM, rapid eye
movement when you're sleeping.

00:44:43.912 --> 00:44:44.870 align:middle line:90%
>> VILLANUEVA: Exactly.

00:44:44.870 --> 00:44:47.630 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: And explain
that it was mimicking that.

00:44:47.630 --> 00:44:48.970 align:middle line:90%
>> VILLANUEVA: Yeah.

00:44:48.970 --> 00:44:54.050 align:middle line:84%
Originally, the REM is a stage
of our sleeping patterns.

00:44:54.050 --> 00:44:56.830 align:middle line:84%
And when you are
in that stage, you

00:44:56.830 --> 00:44:59.000 align:middle line:84%
are actually receiving
volumes of information

00:44:59.000 --> 00:45:02.560 align:middle line:84%
that are really big, big
amounts of information, even

00:45:02.560 --> 00:45:04.840 align:middle line:90%
bigger than when you are awake.

00:45:04.840 --> 00:45:07.880 align:middle line:84%
So something is going
on when you are in REM.

00:45:07.880 --> 00:45:11.920 align:middle line:84%
Years later, a
physicist from France,

00:45:11.920 --> 00:45:14.108 align:middle line:84%
Jean-Pierre Garnier
Malet, he is--

00:45:14.108 --> 00:45:15.820 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Jean-Pierre Garnier.

00:45:15.820 --> 00:45:17.278 align:middle line:84%
>> VILLANUEVA:
Jean-Pierre Garnier,

00:45:17.278 --> 00:45:21.549 align:middle line:84%
he developed a theory
called the double in time.

00:45:21.549 --> 00:45:22.590 align:middle line:90%
That was the translation.

00:45:22.590 --> 00:45:23.880 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Double in time, OK.

00:45:23.880 --> 00:45:27.410 align:middle line:84%
>> VILLANUEVA: And he says
that everything exists with

00:45:27.410 --> 00:45:29.584 align:middle line:84%
a double, and we are
not an exception.

00:45:29.584 --> 00:45:30.750 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Like a mirrored--

00:45:30.750 --> 00:45:30.920 align:middle line:90%
>> VILLANUEVA: Like stars--

00:45:30.920 --> 00:45:33.182 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: --copy in the
time-space continuum.

00:45:33.182 --> 00:45:35.140 align:middle line:84%
>> VILLANUEVA: Stars,
galaxies, and everything,

00:45:35.140 --> 00:45:37.700 align:middle line:84%
even living things
have a double.

00:45:37.700 --> 00:45:38.880 align:middle line:90%
Particles, no?

00:45:38.880 --> 00:45:40.270 align:middle line:90%
You exist as a particle.

00:45:40.270 --> 00:45:42.029 align:middle line:90%
You exist as a wave.

00:45:42.029 --> 00:45:43.070 align:middle line:90%
These are the same thing.

00:45:43.070 --> 00:45:45.250 align:middle line:84%
So our consciousness
do the same.

00:45:45.250 --> 00:45:48.380 align:middle line:84%
And he says that
when we are in REM,

00:45:48.380 --> 00:45:52.000 align:middle line:84%
we are actually exchanging
information with our double

00:45:52.000 --> 00:45:53.840 align:middle line:90%
in the future.

00:45:53.840 --> 00:45:55.840 align:middle line:84%
It's not a physical
being in the future.

00:45:55.840 --> 00:45:58.880 align:middle line:84%
It's a wavelength
that is covered

00:45:58.880 --> 00:46:00.295 align:middle line:90%
in all the possible futures.

00:46:00.295 --> 00:46:02.750 align:middle line:84%
And he can choose for
you the best future

00:46:02.750 --> 00:46:05.110 align:middle line:84%
possible for solving
the situation you

00:46:05.110 --> 00:46:05.910 align:middle line:90%
are going through.

00:46:05.910 --> 00:46:08.400 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: I know I've heard
this and experienced this

00:46:08.400 --> 00:46:11.810 align:middle line:84%
in ways that are very similar
to exactly what you're saying.

00:46:11.810 --> 00:46:15.190 align:middle line:84%
So the language might be a
little different around some

00:46:15.190 --> 00:46:17.000 align:middle line:90%
of it, but it's the same thing.

00:46:17.000 --> 00:46:20.212 align:middle line:84%
We're working with our future
outcomes during dream time.

00:46:20.212 --> 00:46:21.170 align:middle line:90%
>> VILLANUEVA: Exactly.

00:46:21.170 --> 00:46:23.070 align:middle line:84%
And that's what
Jean-Pierre says.

00:46:23.070 --> 00:46:26.340 align:middle line:84%
When I read about his
theory and the law of double

00:46:26.340 --> 00:46:28.250 align:middle line:84%
in time and all
these things, I said,

00:46:28.250 --> 00:46:33.670 align:middle line:84%
there must be another
application to do it awake.

00:46:33.670 --> 00:46:36.020 align:middle line:84%
So I thought, because
I know EMDR-- that's

00:46:36.020 --> 00:46:39.330 align:middle line:84%
another modality-- is eye
movement, the sensitization,

00:46:39.330 --> 00:46:46.220 align:middle line:84%
reprocessing, it collapses,
let's say, trauma, doing

00:46:46.220 --> 00:46:47.320 align:middle line:90%
the eye movements.

00:46:47.320 --> 00:46:49.834 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: Yes, I know different
practitioners that use EMDR

00:46:49.834 --> 00:46:51.250 align:middle line:84%
and have a lot of
success with it.

00:46:51.250 --> 00:46:54.210 align:middle line:84%
>> VILLANUEVA: So I knew
EMDR, and I thought maybe

00:46:54.210 --> 00:46:56.520 align:middle line:84%
what's happening is not that
you balance the function

00:46:56.520 --> 00:47:00.120 align:middle line:84%
of the right and left brain,
but you are actually creating

00:47:00.120 --> 00:47:01.900 align:middle line:90%
an artificial REM.

00:47:01.900 --> 00:47:03.900 align:middle line:84%
And you are
downloading information

00:47:03.900 --> 00:47:05.030 align:middle line:90%
to correct the thing.

00:47:05.030 --> 00:47:12.940 align:middle line:84%
So I ask my other self, is it
possible that you can do this?

00:47:12.940 --> 00:47:15.810 align:middle line:84%
And then I just close my
eyes and move the eyes

00:47:15.810 --> 00:47:17.290 align:middle line:90%
under the eyelids.

00:47:17.290 --> 00:47:19.850 align:middle line:84%
And then I download this
amount of information.

00:47:19.850 --> 00:47:22.800 align:middle line:84%
And I write down and
I have a whole graphic

00:47:22.800 --> 00:47:26.270 align:middle line:84%
of how time moves from
the past into the future,

00:47:26.270 --> 00:47:28.030 align:middle line:84%
and then from the
future into our present,

00:47:28.030 --> 00:47:31.200 align:middle line:84%
and how we can reverse
the movement in order

00:47:31.200 --> 00:47:34.660 align:middle line:84%
to correct our past and
receive a different person.

00:47:34.660 --> 00:47:38.120 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: So in other words,
reprogram our past so that

00:47:38.120 --> 00:47:42.742 align:middle line:84%
our present and future turns
out in a more advantageous way?

00:47:42.742 --> 00:47:43.700 align:middle line:90%
>> VILLANUEVA: Exactly.

00:47:43.700 --> 00:47:46.660 align:middle line:84%
It's our will to
be better, but it

00:47:46.660 --> 00:47:51.660 align:middle line:84%
depends on the interaction with
your other part in the future

00:47:51.660 --> 00:47:53.140 align:middle line:90%
to fix the past.

00:47:53.140 --> 00:47:54.900 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: And I
was just talking--

00:47:54.900 --> 00:47:57.880 align:middle line:84%
I had a show recently with
Sheila Gillette and the THEO

00:47:57.880 --> 00:47:59.700 align:middle line:84%
group, and I asked
them this question.

00:47:59.700 --> 00:48:02.290 align:middle line:84%
And they said it's
absolutely possible

00:48:02.290 --> 00:48:03.570 align:middle line:90%
and we do it all the time.

00:48:03.570 --> 00:48:06.870 align:middle line:84%
We may not know it, but
different modalities,

00:48:06.870 --> 00:48:09.390 align:middle line:84%
we are doing it consciously
or unconsciously,

00:48:09.390 --> 00:48:12.050 align:middle line:84%
programming our past so that
we have a different outcome

00:48:12.050 --> 00:48:13.150 align:middle line:90%
in our present and future.

00:48:13.150 --> 00:48:13.983 align:middle line:90%
>> VILLANUEVA: Yeah.

00:48:13.983 --> 00:48:17.590 align:middle line:84%
For me it's is almost like
jumping into another reality.

00:48:17.590 --> 00:48:18.590 align:middle line:90%
Look at this experience.

00:48:18.590 --> 00:48:20.180 align:middle line:90%
I had two cars, OK.

00:48:20.180 --> 00:48:24.280 align:middle line:84%
I left one car parked
close to a corner,

00:48:24.280 --> 00:48:25.780 align:middle line:90%
very close to the corner.

00:48:25.780 --> 00:48:30.440 align:middle line:84%
So when I was parking the car I
thought, maybe it's too close.

00:48:30.440 --> 00:48:32.780 align:middle line:84%
Maybe a car passing
by too fast is going

00:48:32.780 --> 00:48:34.827 align:middle line:90%
to break the rearview mirror.

00:48:34.827 --> 00:48:36.410 align:middle line:84%
I thought about it,
but then I thought

00:48:36.410 --> 00:48:39.390 align:middle line:84%
there is no other way to
park, so I left it there.

00:48:39.390 --> 00:48:42.320 align:middle line:84%
I went to my
apartment at the time.

00:48:42.320 --> 00:48:47.500 align:middle line:84%
And then in the morning, I took
the other car and went out.

00:48:47.500 --> 00:48:51.210 align:middle line:84%
When I was going close to
the corner, I look at my car,

00:48:51.210 --> 00:48:53.330 align:middle line:84%
and I noticed the
rearview mirror

00:48:53.330 --> 00:48:55.540 align:middle line:90%
was in the floor, broken.

00:48:55.540 --> 00:48:58.280 align:middle line:84%
And I thought oh my
god, I knew it, right?

00:48:58.280 --> 00:49:00.757 align:middle line:84%
Yeah, but my mind
participated on the creation

00:49:00.757 --> 00:49:01.840 align:middle line:90%
of that specific timeline.

00:49:01.840 --> 00:49:03.381 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: Yes, you
made that choice.

00:49:03.381 --> 00:49:05.320 align:middle line:84%
>> VILLANUEVA: So I
went to pick up my son.

00:49:05.320 --> 00:49:09.230 align:middle line:84%
And when I was coming back
from picking up my son,

00:49:09.230 --> 00:49:12.890 align:middle line:84%
I did the process
to correct the time.

00:49:12.890 --> 00:49:15.380 align:middle line:84%
And then the most
weird thing happened.

00:49:15.380 --> 00:49:19.720 align:middle line:84%
I had a new memory,
an impossible memory.

00:49:19.720 --> 00:49:22.590 align:middle line:84%
I had the memory that I parked
my car in the other side

00:49:22.590 --> 00:49:23.400 align:middle line:90%
of the street.

00:49:23.400 --> 00:49:24.858 align:middle line:84%
And I thought,
that's not possible.

00:49:24.858 --> 00:49:27.730 align:middle line:84%
I remember parking
my car in that side.

00:49:27.730 --> 00:49:30.530 align:middle line:90%
So I was approaching the street.

00:49:30.530 --> 00:49:34.700 align:middle line:84%
And I look, and one car that
looks exactly like my mine

00:49:34.700 --> 00:49:36.730 align:middle line:84%
was with a broken
rearview mirror.

00:49:36.730 --> 00:49:40.310 align:middle line:84%
My car was parked intact on
the other side of the street.

00:49:40.310 --> 00:49:41.110 align:middle line:90%
And I was like--

00:49:41.110 --> 00:49:42.310 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Wow.

00:49:42.310 --> 00:49:44.310 align:middle line:84%
>> VILLANUEVA: I was
like, what happened?

00:49:44.310 --> 00:49:45.730 align:middle line:90%
Things like that are happening--

00:49:45.730 --> 00:49:45.840 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: That's a trip.

00:49:45.840 --> 00:49:47.230 align:middle line:84%
>> VILLANUEVA:
--with this thing.

00:49:47.230 --> 00:49:51.590 align:middle line:84%
So people that are using this
technique, they are telling me,

00:49:51.590 --> 00:49:54.550 align:middle line:84%
it's like jumping into
a different timeline.

00:49:54.550 --> 00:49:56.910 align:middle line:84%
It's like you correct the
past, you create a new past,

00:49:56.910 --> 00:49:58.830 align:middle line:84%
and now the echos
of that new past

00:49:58.830 --> 00:50:01.050 align:middle line:90%
is correcting your present.

00:50:01.050 --> 00:50:05.085 align:middle line:84%
And yeah, new memories
come into you.

00:50:05.085 --> 00:50:07.460 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: It would have to
if you've corrected the past.

00:50:07.460 --> 00:50:09.460 align:middle line:84%
Then the past would have
to be different, right?

00:50:09.460 --> 00:50:11.100 align:middle line:84%
>> VILLANUEVA: The problem
is I had two memories.

00:50:11.100 --> 00:50:11.650 align:middle line:90%
I had the memory--

00:50:11.650 --> 00:50:13.000 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: Yes, of what
you thought you did,

00:50:13.000 --> 00:50:13.380 align:middle line:90%
what you did do.

00:50:13.380 --> 00:50:14.170 align:middle line:84%
>> VILLANUEVA: --of parking
the car right there,

00:50:14.170 --> 00:50:16.280 align:middle line:90%
and the other memory too.

00:50:16.280 --> 00:50:17.730 align:middle line:90%
Yeah, that's really weird.

00:50:17.730 --> 00:50:20.490 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: That's a discussion
in and of itself that could

00:50:20.490 --> 00:50:22.850 align:middle line:90%
probably go on for days.

00:50:22.850 --> 00:50:25.780 align:middle line:84%
So you are working with
people, with clients,

00:50:25.780 --> 00:50:30.890 align:middle line:84%
using this awake REM,
using the eye movement,

00:50:30.890 --> 00:50:36.990 align:middle line:84%
using your conscious
intention of a situation

00:50:36.990 --> 00:50:39.690 align:middle line:84%
that you would like to
have altered, right?

00:50:39.690 --> 00:50:44.990 align:middle line:84%
And you're taking it to the
past, and then gathering.

00:50:44.990 --> 00:50:48.950 align:middle line:84%
Just explain briefly the
process so people get a flavor.

00:50:48.950 --> 00:50:51.460 align:middle line:84%
They might have to
come to you or learn

00:50:51.460 --> 00:50:54.330 align:middle line:84%
to speak Spanish and go
to your side or something.

00:50:54.330 --> 00:50:55.860 align:middle line:90%
>> VILLANUEVA: Probably.

00:50:55.860 --> 00:50:59.580 align:middle line:84%
What I received originally was
a graphic of how time moves.

00:50:59.580 --> 00:51:02.590 align:middle line:84%
Then I had to apply that
graphic to my being.

00:51:02.590 --> 00:51:05.950 align:middle line:84%
And I noticed that our bodies
represent, symbolically,

00:51:05.950 --> 00:51:08.110 align:middle line:90%
how we move through time.

00:51:08.110 --> 00:51:10.230 align:middle line:84%
So I realized that
we have this rod

00:51:10.230 --> 00:51:12.570 align:middle line:84%
of energy coming from
the base of the spine

00:51:12.570 --> 00:51:13.950 align:middle line:90%
to the top of your head.

00:51:13.950 --> 00:51:16.400 align:middle line:84%
And it's like a column
of bright light.

00:51:16.400 --> 00:51:20.730 align:middle line:84%
And let's say that that column
is collecting your energy,

00:51:20.730 --> 00:51:23.980 align:middle line:84%
and is also connecting you with
the planet, with the center

00:51:23.980 --> 00:51:26.170 align:middle line:90%
of the universe also.

00:51:26.170 --> 00:51:29.856 align:middle line:84%
Now once you recognize
that, you know

00:51:29.856 --> 00:51:32.180 align:middle line:84%
that the density
or the gravity goes

00:51:32.180 --> 00:51:36.500 align:middle line:84%
different from the base of your
spine to the top of your head.

00:51:36.500 --> 00:51:39.620 align:middle line:84%
So time runs differently in
the surface of the planet

00:51:39.620 --> 00:51:43.730 align:middle line:84%
than if you go away, especially
if you approach the speed

00:51:43.730 --> 00:51:45.120 align:middle line:90%
of light when you go out.

00:51:45.120 --> 00:51:49.100 align:middle line:84%
And that's proved for relativity
and all we know from physics.

00:51:49.100 --> 00:51:51.730 align:middle line:84%
So right now, right
here, right now,

00:51:51.730 --> 00:51:55.510 align:middle line:84%
you are walking with past,
present, and future together

00:51:55.510 --> 00:51:58.980 align:middle line:84%
in your spine or
your rod of energy.

00:51:58.980 --> 00:52:02.110 align:middle line:84%
So past is in the bottom
and is in a read color.

00:52:02.110 --> 00:52:03.870 align:middle line:90%
The vibration is red.

00:52:03.870 --> 00:52:07.200 align:middle line:84%
And the future is
right here in violet.

00:52:07.200 --> 00:52:09.900 align:middle line:84%
And now the present
is right here.

00:52:09.900 --> 00:52:12.260 align:middle line:84%
So what I receive
is that you don't

00:52:12.260 --> 00:52:15.600 align:middle line:84%
need to be in the present,
but not in the present

00:52:15.600 --> 00:52:20.050 align:middle line:84%
like I have this problem
and I don't know what to do.

00:52:20.050 --> 00:52:21.430 align:middle line:90%
I have these heavy weight on me.

00:52:21.430 --> 00:52:22.890 align:middle line:90%
No, no, nothing like that.

00:52:22.890 --> 00:52:26.950 align:middle line:84%
You are in the present
like being present.

00:52:26.950 --> 00:52:29.790 align:middle line:84%
It's not just being in
the now but being present.

00:52:29.790 --> 00:52:33.040 align:middle line:84%
And the suggestion was look
at yourself inside this room.

00:52:33.040 --> 00:52:36.890 align:middle line:84%
The room is empty-- no
pictures, no windows, no doors.

00:52:36.890 --> 00:52:39.210 align:middle line:90%
It's a white room, no furniture.

00:52:39.210 --> 00:52:41.270 align:middle line:90%
You are there empty.

00:52:41.270 --> 00:52:42.070 align:middle line:90%
And that's enough.

00:52:42.070 --> 00:52:42.873 align:middle line:90%
That's neutrality.

00:52:42.873 --> 00:52:44.956 align:middle line:84%
That's what you need from
the present, neutrality.

00:52:44.956 --> 00:52:45.760 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: The neutrality, yes.

00:52:45.760 --> 00:52:47.259 align:middle line:84%
>> VILLANUEVA: Once
you are neutral,

00:52:47.259 --> 00:52:50.860 align:middle line:84%
you run through
the rod of light,

00:52:50.860 --> 00:52:55.560 align:middle line:84%
moving your eyes down under
your eyelids, going to the past.

00:52:55.560 --> 00:52:59.070 align:middle line:84%
Focusing on the past, then you
collect all the information

00:52:59.070 --> 00:53:00.460 align:middle line:90%
about this problem I have.

00:53:00.460 --> 00:53:00.840 align:middle line:90%
Let's say--

00:53:00.840 --> 00:53:02.560 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: Consciously
and unconsciously.

00:53:02.560 --> 00:53:05.640 align:middle line:84%
>> VILLANUEVA: Yeah, because
I honestly don't know exactly

00:53:05.640 --> 00:53:06.470 align:middle line:90%
where the roots.

00:53:06.470 --> 00:53:08.740 align:middle line:84%
I was not conscious
of everything.

00:53:08.740 --> 00:53:11.720 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: So your intention
is that all knowledge regarding

00:53:11.720 --> 00:53:14.692 align:middle line:84%
this situation in the
past is collected now.

00:53:14.692 --> 00:53:15.650 align:middle line:90%
>> VILLANUEVA: Exactly.

00:53:15.650 --> 00:53:20.582 align:middle line:84%
Let's say that I have
the problem with,

00:53:20.582 --> 00:53:24.040 align:middle line:84%
I don't know, with the car
or something with my skin.

00:53:24.040 --> 00:53:27.290 align:middle line:84%
So collect all the energy from
the past about this problem.

00:53:27.290 --> 00:53:30.810 align:middle line:84%
Now that I collect everything,
I will run with my eyes

00:53:30.810 --> 00:53:34.500 align:middle line:84%
up directing this energy up
through this column of light

00:53:34.500 --> 00:53:35.940 align:middle line:90%
into the future.

00:53:35.940 --> 00:53:39.154 align:middle line:84%
And then I give these to my
double, or my other being.

00:53:39.154 --> 00:53:40.320 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Your future self.

00:53:40.320 --> 00:53:41.670 align:middle line:90%
>> VILLANUEVA: My future self.

00:53:41.670 --> 00:53:45.000 align:middle line:84%
So I give this to
him and say, you

00:53:45.000 --> 00:53:48.240 align:middle line:84%
know what, I need you
to find the information

00:53:48.240 --> 00:53:50.660 align:middle line:84%
and the right corrects
for this program.

00:53:50.660 --> 00:53:53.910 align:middle line:84%
And then I move my eyes
under like a wiper,

00:53:53.910 --> 00:53:56.420 align:middle line:84%
from one side to
another, until I

00:53:56.420 --> 00:53:58.790 align:middle line:90%
feel that my eyes are getting--

00:53:58.790 --> 00:53:59.937 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Tired and stuck.

00:53:59.937 --> 00:54:00.770 align:middle line:90%
>> VILLANUEVA: Yeah.

00:54:00.770 --> 00:54:04.350 align:middle line:84%
When that happened, I just
stop, and move my eyes down

00:54:04.350 --> 00:54:07.470 align:middle line:84%
and let this energy
download through this rod

00:54:07.470 --> 00:54:11.830 align:middle line:84%
of light, this column of light,
until my eyes go and look

00:54:11.830 --> 00:54:12.840 align:middle line:90%
to the bottom.

00:54:12.840 --> 00:54:15.790 align:middle line:84%
And that energy from the
future is correct in the past,

00:54:15.790 --> 00:54:18.630 align:middle line:84%
because the past, even
though it seems is stuck,

00:54:18.630 --> 00:54:20.812 align:middle line:84%
is actually moving, but
at a very low speed.

00:54:20.812 --> 00:54:21.612 align:middle line:90%
It's moving still.

00:54:21.612 --> 00:54:24.200 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: Yes, much slower
than the future-- fast speed.

00:54:24.200 --> 00:54:26.380 align:middle line:84%
>> VILLANUEVA: The
future moves super fast.

00:54:26.380 --> 00:54:28.910 align:middle line:84%
The past is really slow,
but it's still moving.

00:54:28.910 --> 00:54:31.560 align:middle line:84%
And this energy is
going to fix it.

00:54:31.560 --> 00:54:33.760 align:middle line:84%
So it's like jumping
to a different past.

00:54:33.760 --> 00:54:37.370 align:middle line:84%
Once you put all the energy in
there, you just let go of it

00:54:37.370 --> 00:54:40.460 align:middle line:84%
and you go back to your
room, to your empty room,

00:54:40.460 --> 00:54:42.880 align:middle line:84%
remain there for
a minute at least,

00:54:42.880 --> 00:54:45.135 align:middle line:84%
receiving the echos
from that new past--

00:54:45.135 --> 00:54:46.010 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: The echos.

00:54:46.010 --> 00:54:47.600 align:middle line:84%
>> VILLANUEVA: --the new
memories from whatever

00:54:47.600 --> 00:54:48.110 align:middle line:90%
happened.

00:54:48.110 --> 00:54:50.360 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: Let it just feed
you however it's going to.

00:54:50.360 --> 00:54:51.325 align:middle line:90%
It can be organic.

00:54:51.325 --> 00:54:53.480 align:middle line:84%
It can be a phone call out
of the blue from someone

00:54:53.480 --> 00:54:54.110 align:middle line:90%
that corrects it--

00:54:54.110 --> 00:54:54.540 align:middle line:90%
>> VILLANUEVA: Something.

00:54:54.540 --> 00:54:55.530 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: --anything.

00:54:55.530 --> 00:54:58.610 align:middle line:84%
It's just finding an
unconscious solution.

00:54:58.610 --> 00:55:01.817 align:middle line:84%
>> VILLANUEVA: I have thousands
of testimonies of people using

00:55:01.817 --> 00:55:03.400 align:middle line:84%
these, mostly in the
Latino community,

00:55:03.400 --> 00:55:06.340 align:middle line:84%
because I upload these
video in YouTube.

00:55:06.340 --> 00:55:10.940 align:middle line:84%
And one of those
was this guy who had

00:55:10.940 --> 00:55:12.180 align:middle line:90%
this condition in his mouth.

00:55:12.180 --> 00:55:13.930 align:middle line:90%
He cannot produce saliva.

00:55:13.930 --> 00:55:15.920 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: Oh, that
would be difficult.

00:55:15.920 --> 00:55:18.150 align:middle line:84%
>> VILLANUEVA: So he got
his mouth always dry.

00:55:18.150 --> 00:55:20.380 align:middle line:84%
And he used everything
and tried everything

00:55:20.380 --> 00:55:23.100 align:middle line:84%
he could in the medicine
field, and nothing works.

00:55:23.100 --> 00:55:24.920 align:middle line:84%
And he told me I
did the exercise,

00:55:24.920 --> 00:55:27.520 align:middle line:84%
and at some point when I was
collecting the information,

00:55:27.520 --> 00:55:33.580 align:middle line:84%
I saw that I had a rope, a
very dry rope around my neck.

00:55:33.580 --> 00:55:36.850 align:middle line:84%
And I knew at the moment
that some of my ancestors

00:55:36.850 --> 00:55:39.040 align:middle line:90%
died being hanged.

00:55:39.040 --> 00:55:41.896 align:middle line:84%
And when I knew that, I started
crying and crying and crying.

00:55:41.896 --> 00:55:45.500 align:middle line:84%
And then I took the energy
down and correct the past.

00:55:45.500 --> 00:55:47.900 align:middle line:84%
And then he says, I
remain in the present,

00:55:47.900 --> 00:55:50.900 align:middle line:90%
and my mouth was full of saliva.

00:55:50.900 --> 00:55:52.740 align:middle line:90%
And then I was OK.

00:55:52.740 --> 00:55:53.922 align:middle line:90%
And from there he was OK.

00:55:53.922 --> 00:55:55.380 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: And you
have many, many,

00:55:55.380 --> 00:55:57.060 align:middle line:90%
many people you've helped this.

00:55:57.060 --> 00:55:57.860 align:middle line:90%
Can be anything--

00:55:57.860 --> 00:55:58.070 align:middle line:84%
>> VILLANUEVA: Thousand
of people are using this.

00:55:58.070 --> 00:56:00.390 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: --from your
love life to your work life

00:56:00.390 --> 00:56:03.249 align:middle line:84%
to your physical
life, spiritual life.

00:56:03.249 --> 00:56:05.040 align:middle line:84%
>> VILLANUEVA: The most
extreme is a woman,

00:56:05.040 --> 00:56:09.820 align:middle line:84%
I think is Rosarito, some of
those cities close to the coast

00:56:09.820 --> 00:56:10.620 align:middle line:90%
in Mexico.

00:56:10.620 --> 00:56:11.703 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Yeah, Rosarito.

00:56:11.703 --> 00:56:14.790 align:middle line:84%
>> VILLANUEVA: When Patricia
hurricane was approaching

00:56:14.790 --> 00:56:16.856 align:middle line:90%
the coast, it was category five.

00:56:16.856 --> 00:56:17.730 align:middle line:90%
It was very powerful.

00:56:17.730 --> 00:56:19.100 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Category five, yes.

00:56:19.100 --> 00:56:21.570 align:middle line:84%
>> VILLANUEVA: And she told
me everybody was running from

00:56:21.570 --> 00:56:22.370 align:middle line:90%
the city.

00:56:22.370 --> 00:56:23.870 align:middle line:84%
I approached the
coast and I started

00:56:23.870 --> 00:56:29.000 align:middle line:84%
using your technique to try
to just banish the hurricane.

00:56:29.000 --> 00:56:31.020 align:middle line:84%
I don't know if it was
possible, but I tried it.

00:56:31.020 --> 00:56:33.520 align:middle line:84%
And she followed it,
step by step the thing.

00:56:33.520 --> 00:56:35.370 align:middle line:84%
And when the hurricane
approached the coast,

00:56:35.370 --> 00:56:37.350 align:middle line:90%
it became a tropical song.

00:56:37.350 --> 00:56:40.261 align:middle line:84%
Just touching the
ground, it changes.

00:56:40.261 --> 00:56:42.260 align:middle line:84%
And she says, I don't
know, there were thousands

00:56:42.260 --> 00:56:43.730 align:middle line:90%
of people praying for that.

00:56:43.730 --> 00:56:46.030 align:middle line:90%
But I felt I did it.

00:56:46.030 --> 00:56:47.050 align:middle line:90%
And I was like whoa.

00:56:47.050 --> 00:56:49.470 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: Well
that's a really-- see,

00:56:49.470 --> 00:56:53.480 align:middle line:84%
I don't think very many human
beings understand the power

00:56:53.480 --> 00:56:55.800 align:middle line:84%
that they have through their
mind and the full force

00:56:55.800 --> 00:57:01.230 align:middle line:84%
of their being, that they're,
in a sense, you know,

00:57:01.230 --> 00:57:04.290 align:middle line:84%
gods in themselves,
that god energy,

00:57:04.290 --> 00:57:06.720 align:middle line:84%
that god experience can be
experienced through the human

00:57:06.720 --> 00:57:07.380 align:middle line:90%
species.

00:57:07.380 --> 00:57:09.630 align:middle line:84%
>> VILLANUEVA: When you are
working in a consciousness

00:57:09.630 --> 00:57:12.550 align:middle line:84%
of a fourth dimension,
you can fix time.

00:57:12.550 --> 00:57:13.419 align:middle line:90%
That's the thing.

00:57:13.419 --> 00:57:14.710 align:middle line:90%
And that's what we have to do--

00:57:14.710 --> 00:57:15.960 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: And they seem
like miracles to us,

00:57:15.960 --> 00:57:18.560 align:middle line:84%
but for people in other realms,
for beings in other realms,

00:57:18.560 --> 00:57:21.210 align:middle line:84%
not a big deal,
every day business.

00:57:21.210 --> 00:57:22.860 align:middle line:90%
Well that's magnificent.

00:57:22.860 --> 00:57:24.070 align:middle line:90%
Let me ask you something.

00:57:24.070 --> 00:57:27.740 align:middle line:84%
If someone wants to contact
you and work with you directly,

00:57:27.740 --> 00:57:28.586 align:middle line:90%
how do they do that?

00:57:28.586 --> 00:57:30.960 align:middle line:84%
Because your website's in
Spanish, so if I arrived there,

00:57:30.960 --> 00:57:32.705 align:middle line:84%
I would have no
idea what it says.

00:57:32.705 --> 00:57:34.620 align:middle line:84%
>> VILLANUEVA: I'm going to be
preparing some stuff in English

00:57:34.620 --> 00:57:36.350 align:middle line:84%
soon because people
are asking me--

00:57:36.350 --> 00:57:37.683 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Do you have an email?

00:57:37.683 --> 00:57:40.230 align:middle line:84%
>> VILLANUEVA: They can email
me to enriquegvm@aol.com.

00:57:40.230 --> 00:57:42.519 align:middle line:90%


00:57:42.519 --> 00:57:43.810 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: OK, enriquegvm@aol--

00:57:43.810 --> 00:57:47.550 align:middle line:90%


00:57:47.550 --> 00:57:48.820 align:middle line:90%
>> VILLANUEVA: @aol.com.

00:57:48.820 --> 00:57:50.460 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: OK, good, so
everybody knows know how

00:57:50.460 --> 00:57:51.260 align:middle line:90%
to reach you.

00:57:51.260 --> 00:57:53.700 align:middle line:84%
>> VILLANUEVA: Or they can
look for me in Facebook with

00:57:53.700 --> 00:57:55.909 align:middle line:90%
my name, Enrique Villanueva.

00:57:55.909 --> 00:57:56.950 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: OK, very good.

00:57:56.950 --> 00:57:59.255 align:middle line:90%
Well, we're out of time.

00:57:59.255 --> 00:58:00.880 align:middle line:84%
>> VILLANUEVA: Let's
do the techniques.

00:58:00.880 --> 00:58:02.800 align:middle line:90%
We'll extend the time.

00:58:02.800 --> 00:58:04.470 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: Yes, we're
not out of time.

00:58:04.470 --> 00:58:06.760 align:middle line:90%
It's an illusion.

00:58:06.760 --> 00:58:11.380 align:middle line:90%
Enrique, two last questions.

00:58:11.380 --> 00:58:13.300 align:middle line:84%
Are you looking forward
to contact again?

00:58:13.300 --> 00:58:15.217 align:middle line:84%
Do you think you will
need to have this again?

00:58:15.217 --> 00:58:16.799 align:middle line:84%
Or do you think
you've been downloaded

00:58:16.799 --> 00:58:19.400 align:middle line:84%
with enough to take you through
this lifetime and so forth,

00:58:19.400 --> 00:58:22.190 align:middle line:90%
or will it be a surprise?

00:58:22.190 --> 00:58:24.190 align:middle line:84%
>> VILLANUEVA: That's
a good question.

00:58:24.190 --> 00:58:26.900 align:middle line:84%
Every time I have the experience
with them is traumatic,

00:58:26.900 --> 00:58:29.360 align:middle line:84%
not because they are
menacing or anything.

00:58:29.360 --> 00:58:37.300 align:middle line:84%
It's because it is very hard
to be with my conscious mind

00:58:37.300 --> 00:58:38.440 align:middle line:90%
when it's happening.

00:58:38.440 --> 00:58:40.170 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: Well
it's disconcerting.

00:58:40.170 --> 00:58:44.640 align:middle line:84%
>> VILLANUEVA: Yeah, so I
prefer and I avoid the physical

00:58:44.640 --> 00:58:46.530 align:middle line:90%
encounter with them.

00:58:46.530 --> 00:58:48.400 align:middle line:84%
I prefer to keep my
distance from that.

00:58:48.400 --> 00:58:53.460 align:middle line:84%
But the mental contact, I love
that because I feel confident

00:58:53.460 --> 00:58:54.860 align:middle line:90%
and the information is there.

00:58:54.860 --> 00:58:57.810 align:middle line:84%
And then they can
give me a sighting

00:58:57.810 --> 00:59:02.010 align:middle line:84%
to really prove that
whatever I'm receiving is OK.

00:59:02.010 --> 00:59:04.880 align:middle line:84%
So I don't need the physical
encounter with them anymore.

00:59:04.880 --> 00:59:06.410 align:middle line:90%
I hope I don't have it.

00:59:06.410 --> 00:59:09.797 align:middle line:84%
But I'm open if there
is a need for that.

00:59:09.797 --> 00:59:10.880 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: It will happen.

00:59:10.880 --> 00:59:12.120 align:middle line:90%
>> VILLANUEVA: I invite it.

00:59:12.120 --> 00:59:14.250 align:middle line:84%
It is going to
happen, I know that.

00:59:14.250 --> 00:59:15.160 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: It is, OK.

00:59:15.160 --> 00:59:18.390 align:middle line:84%
Now the final question--
given what you just said

00:59:18.390 --> 00:59:21.720 align:middle line:84%
and how it is for
you, do you think

00:59:21.720 --> 00:59:24.410 align:middle line:84%
that humanity is ready for
this kind of open contact

00:59:24.410 --> 00:59:27.240 align:middle line:90%
with beings from other places?

00:59:27.240 --> 00:59:28.040 align:middle line:90%
>> VILLANUEVA: Yes.

00:59:28.040 --> 00:59:30.737 align:middle line:84%
And I think the Disclosure
Project is part of this.

00:59:30.737 --> 00:59:33.070 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: You think that
what-- oh, Disclosure Project.

00:59:33.070 --> 00:59:35.440 align:middle line:84%
But considering
the fear you had,

00:59:35.440 --> 00:59:39.284 align:middle line:84%
how do you feel most of
the species will feel?

00:59:39.284 --> 00:59:40.450 align:middle line:90%
>> VILLANUEVA: Disconcerted.

00:59:40.450 --> 00:59:44.500 align:middle line:84%
They will feel like
lost, because it's

00:59:44.500 --> 00:59:49.220 align:middle line:84%
going to shake all the paradigms
and the way we see reality.

00:59:49.220 --> 00:59:52.510 align:middle line:84%
And you see, when
we look at them,

00:59:52.510 --> 00:59:54.400 align:middle line:90%
we don't see the whole aspect.

00:59:54.400 --> 00:59:58.450 align:middle line:84%
We see whatever we
can project into them.

00:59:58.450 --> 01:00:01.420 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: Whatever we
can perceive, or able to.

01:00:01.420 --> 01:00:02.885 align:middle line:84%
We're projecting
our perceptions.

01:00:02.885 --> 01:00:04.260 align:middle line:84%
>> VILLANUEVA: We
are projecting.

01:00:04.260 --> 01:00:05.270 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Yeah, exactly.

01:00:05.270 --> 01:00:07.770 align:middle line:84%
>> VILLANUEVA: So whatever the
filter that we have inside is

01:00:07.770 --> 01:00:08.940 align:middle line:90%
what we see from them.

01:00:08.940 --> 01:00:12.290 align:middle line:10%
So we see them as advanced
technological civilization.

01:00:12.290 --> 01:00:16.030 align:middle line:84%
They are way more
than that, as we are.

01:00:16.030 --> 01:00:18.550 align:middle line:84%
So we are going to see
just fragments of it

01:00:18.550 --> 01:00:19.680 align:middle line:90%
until we wake up.

01:00:19.680 --> 01:00:22.360 align:middle line:84%
And so they are waiting for us
to really expand consciousness

01:00:22.360 --> 01:00:26.230 align:middle line:84%
and to see them in
the real aspect,

01:00:26.230 --> 01:00:29.692 align:middle line:84%
so we can see ourselves
in that same level.

01:00:29.692 --> 01:00:31.900 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: Well I think
that's a perfect place to end

01:00:31.900 --> 01:00:33.060 align:middle line:90%
the conversation.

01:00:33.060 --> 01:00:35.400 align:middle line:84%
And I thank you very much
for coming to be with us.

01:00:35.400 --> 01:00:36.260 align:middle line:84%
>> VILLANUEVA: Thank you
for the opportunity, Regina.

01:00:36.260 --> 01:00:37.780 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: --and
sharing your experience.

01:00:37.780 --> 01:00:39.380 align:middle line:84%
>> VILLANUEVA: Glad
to be here with you.

01:00:39.380 --> 01:00:40.838 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: As we
said a moment ago,

01:00:40.838 --> 01:00:43.470 align:middle line:84%
until his site's up in English,
you can contact him by email,

01:00:43.470 --> 01:00:46.330 align:middle line:90%
which is enriquegvm@aol.com.

01:00:46.330 --> 01:00:49.090 align:middle line:10%
Until next time, thank
you for joining us here

01:00:49.090 --> 01:00:51.130 align:middle line:10%
on "Open Minds."
