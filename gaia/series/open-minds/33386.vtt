00:00:20.287 --> 00:00:21.989 align:middle line:84%
>> Regina Meredith: The baby
boomers were the largest

00:00:21.989 --> 00:00:23.824 align:middle line:90%
demographic in modern history;

00:00:23.824 --> 00:00:26.327 align:middle line:84%
born in the years
following World War II.

00:00:26.327 --> 00:00:29.130 align:middle line:84%
This generation rebelled
against the Vietnam War,

00:00:29.130 --> 00:00:30.931 align:middle line:84%
ushered in health
foods and yoga,

00:00:30.931 --> 00:00:32.967 align:middle line:84%
and are oriented
towards narcissism.

00:00:32.967 --> 00:00:35.169 align:middle line:84%
They're not entering
their retirement years.

00:00:35.169 --> 00:00:36.403 align:middle line:90%
What is their legacy?

00:00:36.403 --> 00:00:37.805 align:middle line:84%
Well, look at current
events around us,

00:00:37.805 --> 00:00:40.241 align:middle line:84%
according to astrologer,
Robert Pheonix.

00:00:40.241 --> 00:00:42.309 align:middle line:84%
Robert is with us today
to speak about how

00:00:42.309 --> 00:00:45.980 align:middle line:84%
and why events are lining up as
they are, and what this means

00:00:45.980 --> 00:00:48.983 align:middle line:84%
to the Me Generation
over the next 10 years.

00:00:48.983 --> 00:00:50.551 align:middle line:90%
Thank you for joining us.

00:00:50.551 --> 00:00:53.287 align:middle line:84%
Your work is very interesting,
because you really tie it

00:00:53.287 --> 00:00:55.589 align:middle line:84%
to current events and make
sense out of us for us,

00:00:55.589 --> 00:00:57.458 align:middle line:84%
and so we're going to be
talking about current themes

00:00:57.458 --> 00:01:00.661 align:middle line:84%
and then the larger
themes generationally

00:01:00.661 --> 00:01:02.530 align:middle line:90%
in two different conversations.

00:01:02.530 --> 00:01:03.998 align:middle line:84%
So, are you comfortable
starting off

00:01:03.998 --> 00:01:05.833 align:middle line:84%
with the big event
in the Boomer's life.

00:01:05.833 --> 00:01:07.868 align:middle line:84%
>> Robert Pheonix: Absolutely,
let's just cut to the chase.

00:01:07.868 --> 00:01:08.702 align:middle line:84%
>> Regina Meredith:
Let's dive right into it.

00:01:08.702 --> 00:01:09.737 align:middle line:90%
>> Robert Pheonix: Yeah, yeah.

00:01:09.737 --> 00:01:11.138 align:middle line:84%
>> Regina Meredith:
The assassination

00:01:11.138 --> 00:01:13.307 align:middle line:84%
of President Kennedy; whether
you go to conspiracy circles,

00:01:13.307 --> 00:01:16.744 align:middle line:84%
whether you go to historians,
something fundamentally changed

00:01:16.744 --> 00:01:20.314 align:middle line:84%
in the world at that time
when the Boomers were young;

00:01:20.314 --> 00:01:21.982 align:middle line:90%
preteens, kids, and teens.

00:01:21.982 --> 00:01:25.219 align:middle line:84%
And, you say there was
almost an alternate timeline

00:01:25.219 --> 00:01:27.888 align:middle line:84%
that was created
for this generation,

00:01:27.888 --> 00:01:30.824 align:middle line:84%
which is the Pluto Generation;
the Pluto and Leo Generation.

00:01:30.824 --> 00:01:32.760 align:middle line:84%
>> Robert Pheonix: Well, it's
not just their generation,

00:01:32.760 --> 00:01:34.828 align:middle line:84%
but for the entire
planet actually.

00:01:34.828 --> 00:01:38.399 align:middle line:84%
So, let's go back and time, and
just kind of track where Pluto

00:01:38.399 --> 00:01:40.266 align:middle line:90%
and Leo came into play.

00:01:40.266 --> 00:01:46.974 align:middle line:84%
Pluto and Leo show up in
1938; in August of 1938,

00:01:46.974 --> 00:01:51.245 align:middle line:84%
and at that time, we aren't
talking the large numbers

00:01:51.245 --> 00:01:52.079 align:middle line:90%
of the baby boomers.

00:01:52.079 --> 00:01:53.814 align:middle line:90%
They come a little bit later.

00:01:53.814 --> 00:01:58.619 align:middle line:84%
They start to come onto
the scene between 1945, 46.

00:01:58.619 --> 00:02:00.654 align:middle line:84%
The war is winding down,
people are coming home,

00:02:00.654 --> 00:02:01.989 align:middle line:84%
and that's when the
babies are being born.

00:02:01.989 --> 00:02:03.691 align:middle line:90%
Hence, the name baby boom.

00:02:03.691 --> 00:02:06.427 align:middle line:84%
So, Pluto and Leo goes
back quite a ways.

00:02:06.427 --> 00:02:10.063 align:middle line:84%
Actually, it goes back really
eight years before Pluto,

00:02:10.063 --> 00:02:12.333 align:middle line:84%
the baby boomers or the
Pluto and Leo generation.

00:02:12.333 --> 00:02:16.737 align:middle line:84%
We really like associate
with the generation

00:02:16.737 --> 00:02:18.906 align:middle line:84%
that really changed the
world in a lot of ways.

00:02:18.906 --> 00:02:22.910 align:middle line:84%
So, that's when it starts,
but it's around 45-46,

00:02:22.910 --> 00:02:27.715 align:middle line:84%
when the kids are being born
and the numbers really shoot up.

00:02:27.715 --> 00:02:31.952 align:middle line:84%
In terms of the event; the event
is the Kennedy assassination.

00:02:31.952 --> 00:02:33.420 align:middle line:84%
>>RM: And, we're just
using this as a hook

00:02:33.420 --> 00:02:35.456 align:middle line:84%
to really get into
the midst of it.

00:02:35.456 --> 00:02:38.425 align:middle line:84%
>>RP: Yeah, absolutely, so
the Kennedy assassination,

00:02:38.425 --> 00:02:41.862 align:middle line:90%
which takes place on 11/22,

00:02:41.862 --> 00:02:43.897 align:middle line:84%
which is a really
interesting number.

00:02:43.897 --> 00:02:47.300 align:middle line:84%
If you add up 11/22,
you get the number 33,

00:02:47.300 --> 00:02:53.040 align:middle line:84%
and 33 is the highest
degree in Freemasonry.

00:02:53.040 --> 00:02:54.341 align:middle line:90%
>>RM: Yes.

00:02:54.341 --> 00:02:57.011 align:middle line:84%
>>RP: In the blue lodge, the
blue rights of Freemasonry

00:02:57.011 --> 00:02:59.546 align:middle line:84%
to the highest degree;
established rights.

00:02:59.546 --> 00:03:01.215 align:middle line:84%
The York rights have
different degrees.

00:03:01.215 --> 00:03:03.350 align:middle line:84%
>>RM: And things happen
on the 33rd parallel.

00:03:03.350 --> 00:03:07.321 align:middle line:84%
>>RP: The 33rd parallel is
a very interesting parallel.

00:03:07.321 --> 00:03:11.859 align:middle line:84%
Dallas is on the 32nd degree,
which is where obviously,

00:03:11.859 --> 00:03:13.694 align:middle line:90%
the assassination took place.

00:03:13.694 --> 00:03:18.465 align:middle line:84%
So, it's just one degree before
the 33rd degree, and that's,

00:03:18.465 --> 00:03:23.270 align:middle line:84%
and apparently, Barack Obama
is a 32nd degree mason.

00:03:23.270 --> 00:03:26.006 align:middle line:84%
So, the 32nd degree is
an important degree.

00:03:26.006 --> 00:03:28.976 align:middle line:84%
You're not a most
perfected mason quite yet,

00:03:28.976 --> 00:03:29.810 align:middle line:90%
but you're right there.

00:03:29.810 --> 00:03:31.745 align:middle line:90%
You're right at the threshold.

00:03:31.745 --> 00:03:32.846 align:middle line:90%
>>RM: What was George Bush?

00:03:32.846 --> 00:03:33.547 align:middle line:90%
Junior.

00:03:33.547 --> 00:03:34.381 align:middle line:90%
>>RP: I don't know what.

00:03:34.381 --> 00:03:35.716 align:middle line:90%
George Bush, Jr. I don't know.

00:03:35.716 --> 00:03:37.284 align:middle line:84%
>>RM: Maybe a second
degree mason.

00:03:37.284 --> 00:03:39.086 align:middle line:84%
Anyway, I don't want
to distract us here.

00:03:39.086 --> 00:03:40.321 align:middle line:90%
>>RP: Right, -33 degrees.

00:03:40.321 --> 00:03:41.588 align:middle line:90%
>>RM: Right.

00:03:41.588 --> 00:03:45.826 align:middle line:84%
>>RP: Anyway, so that
happened on the 32nd parallel,

00:03:45.826 --> 00:03:48.395 align:middle line:84%
but the number 33
is interesting,

00:03:48.395 --> 00:03:52.466 align:middle line:84%
because it's 3 two times, right,
they're mirror images of the 3.

00:03:52.466 --> 00:03:54.935 align:middle line:90%
Kennedy happens to be a Gemini,

00:03:54.935 --> 00:03:57.271 align:middle line:84%
and Gemini plays
a very large role

00:03:57.271 --> 00:04:00.407 align:middle line:84%
in what we would call the
distortion of the timeline,

00:04:00.407 --> 00:04:02.543 align:middle line:90%
because Gemini creates duality.

00:04:02.543 --> 00:04:05.612 align:middle line:84%
That's, it looks like it creates
unity, because if you look

00:04:05.612 --> 00:04:08.615 align:middle line:84%
at Gemini, it's the symbol
of two, but it's capped off,

00:04:08.615 --> 00:04:11.018 align:middle line:90%
and it appears to be a column.

00:04:11.018 --> 00:04:12.252 align:middle line:90%
Right? But, it is two.

00:04:12.252 --> 00:04:15.456 align:middle line:84%
It's kind of two as one,
but it's not really,

00:04:15.456 --> 00:04:16.457 align:middle line:90%
it's not really two as one.

00:04:16.457 --> 00:04:17.925 align:middle line:90%
It's not really one.

00:04:17.925 --> 00:04:20.260 align:middle line:84%
There's a separation
between the two, right?

00:04:20.260 --> 00:04:25.599 align:middle line:84%
So, JFK is a Gemini,
and to me this is kind

00:04:25.599 --> 00:04:29.336 align:middle line:84%
of an astrotheological
ritual sacrifice,

00:04:29.336 --> 00:04:31.004 align:middle line:90%
in that he is a Gemini.

00:04:31.004 --> 00:04:33.474 align:middle line:84%
Marilyn Monroe was
also a Gemini.

00:04:33.474 --> 00:04:36.243 align:middle line:90%
She dies shortly thereafter.

00:04:36.243 --> 00:04:39.780 align:middle line:84%
And, then George Bush,
who was there, supposedly,

00:04:39.780 --> 00:04:43.050 align:middle line:84%
as an operative of the
CIA at Dealey Plaza.

00:04:43.050 --> 00:04:46.687 align:middle line:84%
He's also a Gemini, so
Gemini plays a large role.

00:04:46.687 --> 00:04:50.057 align:middle line:84%
You have two people that were
involved in the assassination

00:04:50.057 --> 00:04:52.993 align:middle line:84%
or in the assassination
narrative.

00:04:52.993 --> 00:04:56.130 align:middle line:84%
You have Lee Harvey Oswald,
and then you have Jack Ruby.

00:04:56.130 --> 00:04:58.799 align:middle line:84%
So, here's Gemini again
getting played out as well.

00:04:58.799 --> 00:05:04.638 align:middle line:84%
And, if you fast forward
through that timeline,

00:05:04.638 --> 00:05:06.707 align:middle line:84%
and we're really
going through a lot.

00:05:06.707 --> 00:05:08.208 align:middle line:84%
We're going through
the Vietnam War.

00:05:08.208 --> 00:05:09.276 align:middle line:90%
>>RM: Yes.

00:05:09.276 --> 00:05:10.778 align:middle line:84%
>>RP: We're going
through a lot of things,

00:05:10.778 --> 00:05:12.045 align:middle line:90%
which we'll talk about.

00:05:12.045 --> 00:05:15.416 align:middle line:84%
We're going through Watergate,
and the fall of Nixon.

00:05:15.416 --> 00:05:19.586 align:middle line:84%
And, Nixon by the way,
Nixon is the ultimate cue

00:05:19.586 --> 00:05:22.289 align:middle line:84%
for the baby boomers and the
Pluto and Leo Generation.

00:05:22.289 --> 00:05:25.993 align:middle line:84%
You know, hopefully, we'll
talk about the "Wizard of Oz".

00:05:25.993 --> 00:05:26.894 align:middle line:90%
>>RM: We'll talk about all that.

00:05:26.894 --> 00:05:28.462 align:middle line:90%
>>RP: Nixon is the Wizard of Oz.

00:05:28.462 --> 00:05:29.530 align:middle line:90%
>>RM: Okay.

00:05:29.530 --> 00:05:32.699 align:middle line:84%
>>RP: He is, he is,
Nixon is the figure

00:05:32.699 --> 00:05:37.137 align:middle line:84%
where they pull the curtain back
and they expose the emperor.

00:05:37.137 --> 00:05:39.506 align:middle line:84%
That is the moment
for this generation.

00:05:39.506 --> 00:05:40.808 align:middle line:84%
Why don't we just talk
about the "Wizard of Oz"?

00:05:40.808 --> 00:05:42.076 align:middle line:90%
>>RM: Please do.

00:05:42.076 --> 00:05:42.843 align:middle line:84%
>>RP: And then we'll get
back into the timeline thing.

00:05:42.843 --> 00:05:43.977 align:middle line:90%
>>RM: Yeah.

00:05:43.977 --> 00:05:45.546 align:middle line:84%
>>RP: So, the "Wizard
of Oz", each generation,

00:05:45.546 --> 00:05:50.517 align:middle line:84%
each sort of Pluto and Leo
generation, has a movie

00:05:50.517 --> 00:05:54.655 align:middle line:84%
or series of movies that are
associated with that generation,

00:05:54.655 --> 00:05:58.659 align:middle line:84%
and they shape the consciousness
of that generation.

00:05:58.659 --> 00:06:02.830 align:middle line:84%
And, I'm of the belief that
these movies are created

00:06:02.830 --> 00:06:07.267 align:middle line:84%
and crafted solely for the
astrological assignation

00:06:07.267 --> 00:06:09.470 align:middle line:90%
and aspects for that generation.

00:06:09.470 --> 00:06:10.938 align:middle line:84%
>>RM: It certainly
seems like it, yes.

00:06:10.938 --> 00:06:14.174 align:middle line:84%
>>RP: Yeah, and so what we
have with the "Wizard of Oz";

00:06:14.174 --> 00:06:16.243 align:middle line:84%
it's kind of interesting,
because there's a couple

00:06:16.243 --> 00:06:18.645 align:middle line:84%
of different themes going
on in the "Wizard of Oz".

00:06:18.645 --> 00:06:23.050 align:middle line:84%
What we have in the "Wizard
of Oz" is ultimately Dorothy

00:06:23.050 --> 00:06:27.488 align:middle line:84%
and her characters, buddies,
they wind up going to, you know,

00:06:27.488 --> 00:06:30.057 align:middle line:84%
the Emerald Kingdom,
and there's the wizard,

00:06:30.057 --> 00:06:32.392 align:middle line:90%
and they pull the curtain back.

00:06:32.392 --> 00:06:36.063 align:middle line:84%
This big powerful wizard; the
guy who's running everything,

00:06:36.063 --> 00:06:39.065 align:middle line:84%
they pull the curtain back,
and really, he's just a bumpkin

00:06:39.065 --> 00:06:42.269 align:middle line:84%
from the Midwest, you know,
who stumbled into this place,

00:06:42.269 --> 00:06:43.804 align:middle line:84%
and saw a good gig
when he had it.

00:06:43.804 --> 00:06:47.808 align:middle line:84%
Right? That is the, that is
the template for the Pluto

00:06:47.808 --> 00:06:53.247 align:middle line:84%
and Leo Generation, because as
they move forward and as we see

00:06:53.247 --> 00:06:55.382 align:middle line:84%
in the wake of the
collective trauma

00:06:55.382 --> 00:06:59.453 align:middle line:84%
of the Kennedy assassination,
we see the split taking place.

00:06:59.453 --> 00:07:02.222 align:middle line:90%
We see Gemini really activated.

00:07:02.222 --> 00:07:04.992 align:middle line:84%
You have the split
between the sexes, right?

00:07:04.992 --> 00:07:06.226 align:middle line:90%
All of a sudden that becomes.

00:07:06.226 --> 00:07:06.927 align:middle line:90%
>>RM: Feminism, yes.

00:07:06.927 --> 00:07:08.161 align:middle line:90%
>>RP: Very pronounced.

00:07:08.161 --> 00:07:10.731 align:middle line:84%
In a lot of ways, people
talk about the Civil Rights

00:07:10.731 --> 00:07:13.233 align:middle line:84%
as being this, you
know, wonderful time

00:07:13.233 --> 00:07:16.670 align:middle line:84%
where African American
consciousness rises,

00:07:16.670 --> 00:07:19.706 align:middle line:84%
and yes it is, but it
also accentuates the split

00:07:19.706 --> 00:07:21.642 align:middle line:84%
between the races in
some ways as well.

00:07:21.642 --> 00:07:24.678 align:middle line:84%
There is a definite black
and white polarity kind

00:07:24.678 --> 00:07:26.980 align:middle line:90%
of going on at that time.

00:07:26.980 --> 00:07:30.050 align:middle line:84%
Then, we also have the split
between the generations.

00:07:30.050 --> 00:07:31.285 align:middle line:90%
That takes place.

00:07:31.285 --> 00:07:34.655 align:middle line:84%
This is all a kind of Gemini
fractal moment in time.

00:07:34.655 --> 00:07:39.259 align:middle line:84%
But, that takes place also in
the campuses of this country.

00:07:39.259 --> 00:07:40.594 align:middle line:90%
>>RM: Yes.

00:07:40.594 --> 00:07:42.596 align:middle line:84%
>>RP: Right, where we had lots
of protests, and you know,

00:07:42.596 --> 00:07:46.833 align:middle line:84%
you had kids, and you had SDS
and all these people wanting

00:07:46.833 --> 00:07:49.503 align:middle line:84%
to take down the
chancellor, or wanting to take

00:07:49.503 --> 00:07:52.406 align:middle line:84%
down whoever was running
the college at that time.

00:07:52.406 --> 00:07:55.609 align:middle line:84%
In that case, that
chancellor is the emperor.

00:07:55.609 --> 00:07:58.478 align:middle line:84%
Right, they're practicing,
they're sharpening their knives,

00:07:58.478 --> 00:08:00.814 align:middle line:84%
because hey, you're
supporting the Vietnam War.

00:08:00.814 --> 00:08:03.216 align:middle line:84%
Or one of your businesses
that's involved here,

00:08:03.216 --> 00:08:06.820 align:middle line:84%
you're invested in, is part of
the military industrial complex,

00:08:06.820 --> 00:08:08.121 align:middle line:90%
so we want to take you down.

00:08:08.121 --> 00:08:10.223 align:middle line:84%
We want to take over, and
this was what was happening

00:08:10.223 --> 00:08:11.792 align:middle line:84%
on college campuses
across the country.

00:08:11.792 --> 00:08:14.161 align:middle line:84%
They were going; they were
going after the emperor, right?

00:08:14.161 --> 00:08:14.995 align:middle line:90%
>>RM: Right.

00:08:14.995 --> 00:08:16.296 align:middle line:90%
>>RP: And, they would not rest

00:08:16.296 --> 00:08:19.565 align:middle line:84%
until ultimately the
curtain was pulled away,

00:08:19.565 --> 00:08:21.101 align:middle line:90%
and the emperor was revealed

00:08:21.101 --> 00:08:23.136 align:middle line:84%
to be just a bumpkin,
and that's Nixon.

00:08:23.136 --> 00:08:24.538 align:middle line:90%
>>RM: Right.

00:08:24.538 --> 00:08:27.841 align:middle line:84%
>>RP: He becomes the Wizard of
Oz, and they have this moment,

00:08:27.841 --> 00:08:31.979 align:middle line:84%
and I think that this is in
some ways, appeared victory

00:08:31.979 --> 00:08:34.281 align:middle line:84%
for the Pluto and
Leo generation.

00:08:34.281 --> 00:08:35.382 align:middle line:90%
Like, they got their god.

00:08:35.382 --> 00:08:35.983 align:middle line:90%
>>RM: Yes, it was.

00:08:35.983 --> 00:08:37.217 align:middle line:90%
>>RP: Yes.

00:08:37.217 --> 00:08:38.885 align:middle line:84%
>>RM: I mean there was
that feeling of jubilation.

00:08:38.885 --> 00:08:39.453 align:middle line:90%
>>RP: Right.

00:08:39.453 --> 00:08:40.087 align:middle line:90%
We got the guy.

00:08:40.087 --> 00:08:41.221 align:middle line:90%
We got the wizard.

00:08:41.221 --> 00:08:44.523 align:middle line:84%
We can move on now, and
we can indulge ourselves

00:08:44.523 --> 00:08:46.326 align:middle line:84%
in the human potential
movements,

00:08:46.326 --> 00:08:51.398 align:middle line:84%
and begin buy a lifestyle,
sort of related purposes.

00:08:51.398 --> 00:08:54.201 align:middle line:84%
And, I mean think that
that's where, they sort of.

00:08:54.201 --> 00:08:56.436 align:middle line:84%
>>RM: It's like mission
accomplished.

00:08:56.436 --> 00:08:58.438 align:middle line:84%
>>RP: Exactly, they
got their man.

00:08:58.438 --> 00:08:58.972 align:middle line:90%
Right?

00:08:58.972 --> 00:08:59.506 align:middle line:90%
>>RM: Right.

00:08:59.506 --> 00:09:00.140 align:middle line:90%
>>RP: Yeah.

00:09:00.140 --> 00:09:01.508 align:middle line:90%
>>RM: But, no.

00:09:01.508 --> 00:09:04.578 align:middle line:84%
No, let's talk about the
political agenda underneath,

00:09:04.578 --> 00:09:07.414 align:middle line:84%
after Kennedy died, when
Johnson came into power.

00:09:07.414 --> 00:09:08.615 align:middle line:90%
>>RP: Right.

00:09:08.615 --> 00:09:10.150 align:middle line:84%
>>RM: And interesting, I
mean, again, I think a lot

00:09:10.150 --> 00:09:13.287 align:middle line:84%
of people have read about
the conspiracy behind it,

00:09:13.287 --> 00:09:15.989 align:middle line:84%
and Johnson supposedly was
fully aware of what was going

00:09:15.989 --> 00:09:18.125 align:middle line:90%
to be transpiring the next day,

00:09:18.125 --> 00:09:20.260 align:middle line:84%
and there was an
agenda in place.

00:09:20.260 --> 00:09:23.530 align:middle line:84%
And, let's talk about that
timeline, that agenda.

00:09:23.530 --> 00:09:25.265 align:middle line:84%
What happened when
that split off,

00:09:25.265 --> 00:09:29.236 align:middle line:84%
and maybe even just take
a second or two to say in,

00:09:29.236 --> 00:09:32.639 align:middle line:84%
through the lens of astrology
what might have happened had

00:09:32.639 --> 00:09:33.307 align:middle line:90%
that not occurred?

00:09:33.307 --> 00:09:34.141 align:middle line:90%
>>RP: Right.

00:09:34.141 --> 00:09:35.475 align:middle line:90%
That's a really good question.

00:09:35.475 --> 00:09:40.147 align:middle line:84%
So, when Kennedy, you have
to look at what was happening

00:09:40.147 --> 00:09:43.050 align:middle line:84%
in Kennedy's life before
he was assassinated.

00:09:43.050 --> 00:09:45.052 align:middle line:84%
And, there was some
really pivotal

00:09:45.052 --> 00:09:49.122 align:middle line:84%
and transformational currents
running through his life.

00:09:49.122 --> 00:09:52.059 align:middle line:84%
Number one, he was hanging
out with a woman by the name

00:09:52.059 --> 00:09:56.897 align:middle line:84%
of Mary Pinchot Meyer, and she
was the wife of Cord Meyer,

00:09:56.897 --> 00:09:59.900 align:middle line:84%
and Cord Meyer at that time
was the head of the CIA.

00:09:59.900 --> 00:10:03.503 align:middle line:84%
Now, the CIA was fully
involved in the research

00:10:03.503 --> 00:10:06.773 align:middle line:84%
around psychedelics;
primarily LSD.

00:10:06.773 --> 00:10:09.209 align:middle line:84%
And, it's part of
the public record

00:10:09.209 --> 00:10:12.779 align:middle line:84%
that Mary Pinchot Meyer was
very close to Timothy Leary.

00:10:12.779 --> 00:10:17.718 align:middle line:84%
So, the story goes like this
that Mary Pinchot Meyer and some

00:10:17.718 --> 00:10:21.888 align:middle line:84%
of her friends were
getting LSD from Tim Leary,

00:10:21.888 --> 00:10:24.691 align:middle line:84%
and they were turning on
congressmen as their lovers,

00:10:24.691 --> 00:10:28.095 align:middle line:84%
and in her case,
JFK, as a president.

00:10:28.095 --> 00:10:32.699 align:middle line:84%
So, JFK was having a full-blown
awakening during this time

00:10:32.699 --> 00:10:33.934 align:middle line:90%
with Mary Pinchot Meyer.

00:10:33.934 --> 00:10:35.836 align:middle line:90%
By the way, after Kennedy dies,

00:10:35.836 --> 00:10:38.638 align:middle line:84%
it's not long before Mary
Pinchot Meyer, you know,

00:10:38.638 --> 00:10:40.173 align:middle line:90%
winds up face down in a river.

00:10:40.173 --> 00:10:41.375 align:middle line:90%
>>RM: Yes.

00:10:41.375 --> 00:10:44.544 align:middle line:84%
>>RP: So, she had a very
pivotal role in his life.

00:10:44.544 --> 00:10:46.079 align:middle line:90%
He's getting turned on.

00:10:46.079 --> 00:10:47.781 align:middle line:84%
Now, what's happens
when he gets turned on,

00:10:47.781 --> 00:10:50.917 align:middle line:84%
when he's looking around,
and he is saying, this war,

00:10:50.917 --> 00:10:52.719 align:middle line:84%
the Viet Nam War
was being ramped up,

00:10:52.719 --> 00:10:55.055 align:middle line:84%
and the Viet Nam War
was all about taking

00:10:55.055 --> 00:10:57.657 align:middle line:90%
over the opium and heroin trade.

00:10:57.657 --> 00:11:00.093 align:middle line:84%
>>RM: Yes, I've seen
documents from that day.

00:11:00.093 --> 00:11:01.194 align:middle line:90%
>>RP: From the French.

00:11:01.194 --> 00:11:02.596 align:middle line:90%
>>RM: Yeah.

00:11:02.596 --> 00:11:03.830 align:middle line:84%
>>RP: The French were running
it, and this was an opportunity

00:11:03.830 --> 00:11:06.566 align:middle line:84%
to go in and take that
over, amongst other things.

00:11:06.566 --> 00:11:09.136 align:middle line:84%
>>RM: Well, and run
all those drugs

00:11:09.136 --> 00:11:10.670 align:middle line:90%
out into those inner cities.

00:11:10.670 --> 00:11:11.972 align:middle line:90%
>>RP: Inner cities.

00:11:11.972 --> 00:11:13.340 align:middle line:84%
>>RM: Of America, and start
a whole different agenda.

00:11:13.340 --> 00:11:15.142 align:middle line:84%
>>RP: Absolutely, that's part
of one of the other agendas,

00:11:15.142 --> 00:11:17.444 align:middle line:84%
because what we see
during that time,

00:11:17.444 --> 00:11:22.282 align:middle line:84%
and it's really unfortunate,
is we have the destruction

00:11:22.282 --> 00:11:25.352 align:middle line:90%
of a lot of young black males.

00:11:25.352 --> 00:11:26.686 align:middle line:90%
>>RM: Absolutely.

00:11:26.686 --> 00:11:30.524 align:middle line:84%
>>RP: And, this is where it
gets really kind of sticky.

00:11:30.524 --> 00:11:32.559 align:middle line:84%
Right? If you have the
young black males coming

00:11:32.559 --> 00:11:35.262 align:middle line:84%
out of the inner city
to fight for this war,

00:11:35.262 --> 00:11:38.064 align:middle line:84%
and they come back;
if they come back.

00:11:38.064 --> 00:11:39.433 align:middle line:90%
>>RM: Right.

00:11:39.433 --> 00:11:42.969 align:middle line:84%
>>RP: They have real issues,
problems, PTSD, and maybe some

00:11:42.969 --> 00:11:47.107 align:middle line:84%
of them have acquired a drug
addiction, a heroin addiction,

00:11:47.107 --> 00:11:49.843 align:middle line:84%
you know, recuperating
somewhere in Hawaii after being.

00:11:49.843 --> 00:11:51.211 align:middle line:90%
>>RM: There's your market.

00:11:51.211 --> 00:11:53.647 align:middle line:84%
>>RP: Yeah, exactly, or they've
realized that there's a lot

00:11:53.647 --> 00:11:56.683 align:middle line:84%
of money in this, and they
want to continue this trade,

00:11:56.683 --> 00:11:58.318 align:middle line:84%
and bring good drugs
into the inner city.

00:11:58.318 --> 00:11:59.219 align:middle line:90%
>>RM: There's your market, yep.

00:11:59.219 --> 00:12:00.987 align:middle line:90%
>>RP: This is unfortunately.

00:12:00.987 --> 00:12:04.624 align:middle line:84%
What's interesting is, is
that while they're away.

00:12:04.624 --> 00:12:06.860 align:middle line:84%
Right, while they're
fighting the war.

00:12:06.860 --> 00:12:09.196 align:middle line:84%
>>RM: For a country in which
they were disenfranchised

00:12:09.196 --> 00:12:10.397 align:middle line:90%
to begin with.

00:12:10.397 --> 00:12:11.464 align:middle line:84%
>>RP: Right, and while
they're fighting the war,

00:12:11.464 --> 00:12:12.766 align:middle line:90%
guess what happens?

00:12:12.766 --> 00:12:16.136 align:middle line:84%
Lyndon Baines Johnson starts
the great society, right?

00:12:16.136 --> 00:12:19.639 align:middle line:84%
And, the great society
was just like,

00:12:19.639 --> 00:12:22.909 align:middle line:84%
just like the Patriot
Act was baked

00:12:22.909 --> 00:12:24.711 align:middle line:90%
and ready to go prior to 911.

00:12:24.711 --> 00:12:25.779 align:middle line:84%
>>RM: Something that
would take a year

00:12:25.779 --> 00:12:27.147 align:middle line:84%
to write is done
in a couple days.

00:12:27.147 --> 00:12:31.685 align:middle line:84%
>>RP: The great society was
very much along the same lines,

00:12:31.685 --> 00:12:35.455 align:middle line:84%
and so the great society is
the birth of the welfare state.

00:12:35.455 --> 00:12:38.892 align:middle line:84%
And, this is where
entitlements become a big part,

00:12:38.892 --> 00:12:45.198 align:middle line:84%
become a much better part in the
years to follow; 1965, 66, 67.

00:12:45.198 --> 00:12:46.500 align:middle line:84%
These are very, very
pivotal years.

00:12:46.500 --> 00:12:50.537 align:middle line:84%
This is also the time when
Saul Alinsky is very active,

00:12:50.537 --> 00:12:54.773 align:middle line:84%
and Saul Alinsky, of course,
was the spiritual mentor.

00:12:54.773 --> 00:12:57.944 align:middle line:84%
I'm not sure if Obama really
spent much time with Alinsky,

00:12:57.944 --> 00:13:03.049 align:middle line:84%
but he was very influenced by
Alinsky's community organizing.

00:13:03.049 --> 00:13:06.820 align:middle line:84%
And at that time, Alinsky was
doing a lot of work in order

00:13:06.820 --> 00:13:10.657 align:middle line:84%
to get money into the inner
cities, and even in places

00:13:10.657 --> 00:13:12.692 align:middle line:84%
that weren't the inner
cities; places that didn't want

00:13:12.692 --> 00:13:16.730 align:middle line:84%
to get welfare, he was there
to push welfare through.

00:13:16.730 --> 00:13:18.765 align:middle line:90%
Now, what happens is, is

00:13:18.765 --> 00:13:22.168 align:middle line:84%
that while these young
black males are off at war,

00:13:22.168 --> 00:13:25.272 align:middle line:84%
either getting blown up or
having their brains scrambled,

00:13:25.272 --> 00:13:28.875 align:middle line:84%
guess who steps into the
breach to be the black male,

00:13:28.875 --> 00:13:33.013 align:middle line:84%
or to be the partner
in that relationship.

00:13:33.013 --> 00:13:33.947 align:middle line:90%
It's the federal government.

00:13:33.947 --> 00:13:35.148 align:middle line:90%
>>RM: Federal government, yep.

00:13:35.148 --> 00:13:37.918 align:middle line:84%
>>RP: They come in, and
they become the provider.

00:13:37.918 --> 00:13:40.987 align:middle line:84%
They're the ones that are
bringing financial sustenance,

00:13:40.987 --> 00:13:45.025 align:middle line:84%
and now we have this whole other
cycle that gets set up during

00:13:45.025 --> 00:13:49.596 align:middle line:84%
that time, which I'm not sure
we've broken out of by the way.

00:13:49.596 --> 00:13:51.731 align:middle line:84%
>>RM: And, that's
coupled with the flooding

00:13:51.731 --> 00:13:52.999 align:middle line:84%
of those neighborhoods
with drugs.

00:13:52.999 --> 00:13:54.367 align:middle line:90%
>>RP: Absolutely.

00:13:54.367 --> 00:13:57.737 align:middle line:84%
Absolutely, and then it becomes
a very difficult environment

00:13:57.737 --> 00:13:59.472 align:middle line:84%
to navigate through,
and of course,

00:13:59.472 --> 00:14:02.375 align:middle line:84%
then we have the civil
unrest of the 60's.

00:14:02.375 --> 00:14:04.277 align:middle line:90%
So, that's all part of it.

00:14:04.277 --> 00:14:08.081 align:middle line:84%
So, Kennedy, in addition
to being turned on by LSD

00:14:08.081 --> 00:14:12.385 align:middle line:84%
and having his mind blown,
he's also thinking about at

00:14:12.385 --> 00:14:15.789 align:middle line:84%
that time, creating
a new currency.

00:14:15.789 --> 00:14:17.157 align:middle line:90%
>>RM: Yes.

00:14:17.157 --> 00:14:20.060 align:middle line:84%
>>RP: And, he was working with
the Hunt Brothers in Texas,

00:14:20.060 --> 00:14:23.596 align:middle line:84%
and the Hunt Brothers were
the sons of Lamar Hunt, right?

00:14:23.596 --> 00:14:28.702 align:middle line:84%
And, so what they were doing is
that they were going and taking

00:14:28.702 --> 00:14:31.404 align:middle line:84%
as much silver as
they could find,

00:14:31.404 --> 00:14:33.707 align:middle line:90%
and cornering the silver market.

00:14:33.707 --> 00:14:37.110 align:middle line:84%
And, Texas has this really
interesting relationship

00:14:37.110 --> 00:14:39.679 align:middle line:84%
with the United States,
where they're the only state

00:14:39.679 --> 00:14:41.681 align:middle line:84%
that can claim its
own sovereignty.

00:14:41.681 --> 00:14:43.416 align:middle line:90%
It's the only state in the Union

00:14:43.416 --> 00:14:46.052 align:middle line:84%
where the two flags can
fly at the same level.

00:14:46.052 --> 00:14:50.623 align:middle line:84%
Texas has an agreement, which
is rubber stamped every year,

00:14:50.623 --> 00:14:52.959 align:middle line:84%
which basically says,
okay, we're going to agree

00:14:52.959 --> 00:14:54.928 align:middle line:84%
to be a part of the
United States.

00:14:54.928 --> 00:14:59.032 align:middle line:84%
Now, Kennedy, John Connolly, who
was from Texas, and in the car

00:14:59.032 --> 00:15:02.535 align:middle line:84%
with Kennedy at the same time,
and the Hunt Brothers, well,

00:15:02.535 --> 00:15:05.605 align:middle line:84%
they're going to corner the
silver market, and they're going

00:15:05.605 --> 00:15:08.975 align:middle line:90%
to create a new silver standard

00:15:08.975 --> 00:15:11.277 align:middle line:84%
in this country to
get us out of.

00:15:11.277 --> 00:15:12.045 align:middle line:90%
>>RM: Yes.

00:15:12.045 --> 00:15:13.079 align:middle line:90%
>>RP: The Federal Reserve.

00:15:13.079 --> 00:15:14.147 align:middle line:84%
>>RM: And, government-backed
currency,

00:15:14.147 --> 00:15:15.215 align:middle line:90%
rather than Federal Reserve.

00:15:15.215 --> 00:15:16.249 align:middle line:90%
>>RP: That's right.

00:15:16.249 --> 00:15:19.052 align:middle line:84%
They were going to
do something similar

00:15:19.052 --> 00:15:20.787 align:middle line:84%
to what Lincoln did
with the green backs.

00:15:20.787 --> 00:15:21.755 align:middle line:90%
>>RM: Yes.

00:15:21.755 --> 00:15:23.456 align:middle line:84%
>>RP: But, this was
a hard currency.

00:15:23.456 --> 00:15:24.824 align:middle line:90%
That's a No No.

00:15:24.824 --> 00:15:25.692 align:middle line:90%
>>RM: Right.

00:15:25.692 --> 00:15:26.526 align:middle line:84%
>>RP: I mean the
people that are.

00:15:26.526 --> 00:15:27.394 align:middle line:90%
>>RM: You don't take stuff away

00:15:27.394 --> 00:15:28.194 align:middle line:84%
from the Federal
Reserve players.

00:15:28.194 --> 00:15:29.562 align:middle line:90%
>>RP: That's right.

00:15:29.562 --> 00:15:32.198 align:middle line:84%
I mean these are the people that
have been running the planet

00:15:32.198 --> 00:15:36.369 align:middle line:84%
with fiat-based lending
for quite a long time.

00:15:36.369 --> 00:15:38.471 align:middle line:84%
So, he was a real
threat to that end.

00:15:38.471 --> 00:15:40.273 align:middle line:84%
>>RM: And, I also heard that at
the same time; I didn't hear,

00:15:40.273 --> 00:15:42.509 align:middle line:84%
I read some documents
a number of years ago,

00:15:42.509 --> 00:15:47.213 align:middle line:84%
that he was also asking
for inside clarification

00:15:47.213 --> 00:15:50.050 align:middle line:84%
on the military issue
having to do with UFO's.

00:15:50.050 --> 00:15:51.351 align:middle line:90%
>>RP: That's right.

00:15:51.351 --> 00:15:52.552 align:middle line:84%
>>RM: And, there was some
funding that was threatened

00:15:52.552 --> 00:15:56.222 align:middle line:84%
to be pulled in one area
if he was not given access

00:15:56.222 --> 00:15:58.258 align:middle line:84%
to that information, and
this was right before his

00:15:58.258 --> 00:15:59.592 align:middle line:90%
assassination as well.

00:15:59.592 --> 00:16:01.961 align:middle line:84%
>>RP: Right, and 10 days
before he was assassinated,

00:16:01.961 --> 00:16:05.999 align:middle line:84%
he gave one of his most
famous speeches about dark

00:16:05.999 --> 00:16:09.669 align:middle line:84%
and insidious cabal
whose power knows end

00:16:09.669 --> 00:16:13.206 align:middle line:84%
and whose reach knows,
you know, no length.

00:16:13.206 --> 00:16:16.709 align:middle line:84%
Really, I mean, so he was
basically saying, hey look,

00:16:16.709 --> 00:16:21.681 align:middle line:84%
these are the forces that we're
up against, and we, you know,

00:16:21.681 --> 00:16:23.049 align:middle line:90%
we need to be aware of them.

00:16:23.049 --> 00:16:24.451 align:middle line:90%
Ten days later he's gone.

00:16:24.451 --> 00:16:26.719 align:middle line:84%
>>RM: So, now, we know
what followed that.

00:16:26.719 --> 00:16:28.254 align:middle line:90%
Deep, deep trauma to the psyche.

00:16:28.254 --> 00:16:29.322 align:middle line:90%
Many people have written

00:16:29.322 --> 00:16:32.092 align:middle line:84%
about what happened
when that occurred.

00:16:32.092 --> 00:16:35.762 align:middle line:84%
That cabal was solidly
able to take control.

00:16:35.762 --> 00:16:37.063 align:middle line:90%
>>RP: Right.

00:16:37.063 --> 00:16:38.198 align:middle line:84%
>>RM: So, they didn't have
any resistance once Kennedy

00:16:38.198 --> 00:16:39.599 align:middle line:90%
was gone.

00:16:39.599 --> 00:16:41.501 align:middle line:84%
Let's look at that other path,
as you say, the divergent path.

00:16:41.501 --> 00:16:42.902 align:middle line:90%
>>RP: Right.

00:16:42.902 --> 00:16:46.906 align:middle line:84%
>>RM: What might have it looked
like under this Pluto and Leo

00:16:46.906 --> 00:16:48.273 align:middle line:90%
if that hadn't happened?

00:16:48.273 --> 00:16:52.645 align:middle line:84%
>>RP: Well, it's interesting
because the term most associated

00:16:52.645 --> 00:16:56.616 align:middle line:84%
with the Kennedy era
is Camelot, and Pluto

00:16:56.616 --> 00:17:01.688 align:middle line:84%
and Leo is representative of
kings and queens, and obviously,

00:17:01.688 --> 00:17:04.858 align:middle line:84%
King Arthur, so what we were
potentially looking at during

00:17:04.858 --> 00:17:09.662 align:middle line:84%
that time was the return of
the grail to some extent.

00:17:09.662 --> 00:17:15.668 align:middle line:84%
You know, you had a generation
that was being sort of turned

00:17:15.668 --> 00:17:21.140 align:middle line:84%
on about the ask not what can be
done for you, but what you can.

00:17:21.140 --> 00:17:22.375 align:middle line:84%
>>RM: What you can
do for your country.

00:17:22.375 --> 00:17:24.144 align:middle line:84%
>>RP: What you can
do for your country.

00:17:24.144 --> 00:17:27.312 align:middle line:84%
This whole notion of people
opening up and looking around,

00:17:27.312 --> 00:17:29.382 align:middle line:84%
and saying I can help
somewhere or you know,

00:17:29.382 --> 00:17:31.151 align:middle line:84%
I can make the world
a better place.

00:17:31.151 --> 00:17:34.053 align:middle line:84%
I mean, think about millions
of people who would have had

00:17:34.053 --> 00:17:36.990 align:middle line:84%
that attitude and would have
had that kind of inspiration

00:17:36.990 --> 00:17:39.659 align:middle line:84%
and zeal, unblemished,
untarnished.

00:17:39.659 --> 00:17:42.395 align:middle line:84%
What kind of work could
they have done with that?

00:17:42.395 --> 00:17:44.631 align:middle line:84%
You know, what kind of power
could they have assembled,

00:17:44.631 --> 00:17:47.667 align:middle line:84%
and said, you know, we're
really going to grow this thing

00:17:47.667 --> 00:17:49.936 align:middle line:90%
and stay true to a vision

00:17:49.936 --> 00:17:53.873 align:middle line:84%
that is unlike any other we've
ever seen on this planet,

00:17:53.873 --> 00:17:56.943 align:middle line:84%
instead of waging war,
we're going to wage peace.

00:17:56.943 --> 00:17:59.846 align:middle line:84%
You know, we're going to find
out how to use technology

00:17:59.846 --> 00:18:04.050 align:middle line:84%
to bring cultivation to areas
of the world that are starving.

00:18:04.050 --> 00:18:05.552 align:middle line:84%
We're going to bring
down disease.

00:18:05.552 --> 00:18:06.920 align:middle line:84%
Not only are we going
to bring down disease,

00:18:06.920 --> 00:18:08.521 align:middle line:84%
we're going to figure out how
we can empower these people

00:18:08.521 --> 00:18:10.290 align:middle line:90%
with their own local economies.

00:18:10.290 --> 00:18:11.224 align:middle line:90%
I mean, I think.

00:18:11.224 --> 00:18:12.525 align:middle line:84%
>>RM: That was the
Leo potential,

00:18:12.525 --> 00:18:13.960 align:middle line:90%
had its corruption not occurred.

00:18:13.960 --> 00:18:15.228 align:middle line:90%
>>RP: That's it.

00:18:15.228 --> 00:18:17.697 align:middle line:84%
Absolutely, because ultimately
what Pluto and Leo have

00:18:17.697 --> 00:18:21.901 align:middle line:84%
to provide is the role of
the king and the queen.

00:18:21.901 --> 00:18:25.705 align:middle line:84%
They have to assume
a royal stance,

00:18:25.705 --> 00:18:28.675 align:middle line:84%
and that would have been the
royal stance because kings

00:18:28.675 --> 00:18:33.847 align:middle line:84%
and queens theoretically would
look to their people and say,

00:18:33.847 --> 00:18:35.381 align:middle line:84%
hey, we've got to
make this better.

00:18:35.381 --> 00:18:37.317 align:middle line:84%
We've got to make this
better, or else, you know,

00:18:37.317 --> 00:18:38.384 align:middle line:84%
these people are
going to revolt.

00:18:38.384 --> 00:18:40.286 align:middle line:84%
>>RM: So, there was
a real chance

00:18:40.286 --> 00:18:42.021 align:middle line:90%
for social reform at that time.

00:18:42.021 --> 00:18:45.325 align:middle line:84%
>>RP: Absolutely, real chance
for social reform, and using,

00:18:45.325 --> 00:18:48.394 align:middle line:84%
look, if you go back to the
United States during that time,

00:18:48.394 --> 00:18:54.901 align:middle line:84%
the lack of debt at that time
was, it was, we can't even begin

00:18:54.901 --> 00:19:00.707 align:middle line:84%
to understand the amount
of money and resources

00:19:00.707 --> 00:19:02.675 align:middle line:84%
that were available
to this country.

00:19:02.675 --> 00:19:05.878 align:middle line:84%
There was manufacturing
that was taking place then.

00:19:05.878 --> 00:19:07.080 align:middle line:90%
>>RM: Yes.

00:19:07.080 --> 00:19:08.881 align:middle line:84%
>>RP: And, again, we did
not accrue a lot of debt.

00:19:08.881 --> 00:19:12.652 align:middle line:84%
There was a great,
you know, GMP,

00:19:12.652 --> 00:19:16.222 align:middle line:84%
and people were not necessary
lured by commercialism

00:19:16.222 --> 00:19:17.890 align:middle line:90%
at that point in time.

00:19:17.890 --> 00:19:20.293 align:middle line:84%
If you had a car, you
know, it was great.

00:19:20.293 --> 00:19:24.797 align:middle line:84%
You know, later on,
it was about two cars.

00:19:24.797 --> 00:19:29.235 align:middle line:84%
There was a certain amount of,
in some ways, understanding

00:19:29.235 --> 00:19:34.741 align:middle line:84%
about the material well being
of what we had at that time.

00:19:34.741 --> 00:19:35.842 align:middle line:90%
>>RM: Right.

00:19:35.842 --> 00:19:37.310 align:middle line:84%
>>RP: People didn't
necessarily want more.

00:19:37.310 --> 00:19:38.244 align:middle line:90%
That came a little bit later.

00:19:38.244 --> 00:19:39.112 align:middle line:84%
>>RM: The standard
was very sane.

00:19:39.112 --> 00:19:39.946 align:middle line:90%
>>RP: It was very sane.

00:19:39.946 --> 00:19:41.180 align:middle line:90%
>>RM: You had what you needed.

00:19:41.180 --> 00:19:43.049 align:middle line:84%
>>RP: You got what you
needed, exactly, absolutely,

00:19:43.049 --> 00:19:46.452 align:middle line:84%
and there were other values
that were associated with that

00:19:46.452 --> 00:19:50.256 align:middle line:84%
that sort of superseded
the need for more, right?

00:19:50.256 --> 00:19:51.090 align:middle line:90%
>>RM: Yeah.

00:19:51.090 --> 00:19:52.325 align:middle line:90%
>>RP: Family, things like that.

00:19:52.325 --> 00:19:54.227 align:middle line:84%
So, if you take all that
into account, that all goes

00:19:54.227 --> 00:19:56.262 align:middle line:90%
into the cauldron, and the Pluto

00:19:56.262 --> 00:20:01.234 align:middle line:84%
and Leo generation had
unparalleled resources and tools

00:20:01.234 --> 00:20:03.836 align:middle line:90%
and enthusiasm to work with.

00:20:03.836 --> 00:20:06.205 align:middle line:84%
>>RM: There was a
certain type of innocence

00:20:06.205 --> 00:20:07.640 align:middle line:90%
that existed at that time still.

00:20:07.640 --> 00:20:08.975 align:middle line:90%
>>RP: Absolutely, absolutely.

00:20:08.975 --> 00:20:11.344 align:middle line:84%
>>RM: I mean, even if you
listen to the music of that era

00:20:11.344 --> 00:20:14.180 align:middle line:84%
around that time, even with
the introduction of Motown,

00:20:14.180 --> 00:20:16.649 align:middle line:84%
the beautiful, harmonious
love songs abounded

00:20:16.649 --> 00:20:17.684 align:middle line:90%
through all the music.

00:20:17.684 --> 00:20:19.752 align:middle line:90%
>>RP: Yeah, the doo-wop groups.

00:20:19.752 --> 00:20:21.788 align:middle line:84%
>>RM: Absolutely, and it
was all about feeling good,

00:20:21.788 --> 00:20:23.456 align:middle line:90%
falling in love, being together,

00:20:23.456 --> 00:20:24.991 align:middle line:84%
making commitments
to each other.

00:20:24.991 --> 00:20:26.326 align:middle line:90%
>>RP: That's right.

00:20:26.326 --> 00:20:29.228 align:middle line:84%
>>RM: It was, as you say,
kind of that Camelot scenario

00:20:29.228 --> 00:20:30.396 align:middle line:90%
on an emotional level.

00:20:30.396 --> 00:20:31.364 align:middle line:90%
>>RP: Right.

00:20:31.364 --> 00:20:32.932 align:middle line:84%
>>RM: And so, after
this occurred,

00:20:32.932 --> 00:20:34.567 align:middle line:90%
the assassination occurred,

00:20:34.567 --> 00:20:37.804 align:middle line:84%
and this corruption started
taking hold, one of the things,

00:20:37.804 --> 00:20:40.206 align:middle line:84%
Aaron Russo; you know
Aaron Russo's work.

00:20:40.206 --> 00:20:40.740 align:middle line:90%
>>RP: Sure.

00:20:40.740 --> 00:20:42.008 align:middle line:90%
>>RM: Okay.

00:20:42.008 --> 00:20:43.576 align:middle line:84%
Before he died, I did an
interview with him, and he said,

00:20:43.576 --> 00:20:48.047 align:middle line:84%
you know, I was actually
being courted to be a member

00:20:48.047 --> 00:20:49.682 align:middle line:90%
of the Rockefeller family.

00:20:49.682 --> 00:20:51.951 align:middle line:84%
And so, he was brought in,
and he was there for one

00:20:51.951 --> 00:20:54.721 align:middle line:90%
of the girls, and I've forgotten

00:20:54.721 --> 00:20:57.357 align:middle line:84%
which of the Rockefeller's it
was off hand, but he told them,

00:20:57.357 --> 00:21:00.059 align:middle line:84%
he said, you don't think woman's
lib was an organic movement.

00:21:00.059 --> 00:21:04.697 align:middle line:84%
He said, we were very much
behind that economically

00:21:04.697 --> 00:21:07.400 align:middle line:84%
and otherwise, because
look, think of this way.

00:21:07.400 --> 00:21:08.801 align:middle line:90%
It's surely practical.

00:21:08.801 --> 00:21:11.437 align:middle line:84%
You get women in the
workforce, you're getting close

00:21:11.437 --> 00:21:13.740 align:middle line:90%
to doubling the tax rolls.

00:21:13.740 --> 00:21:14.340 align:middle line:90%
>>RP: That's right.

00:21:14.340 --> 00:21:15.274 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:21:15.274 --> 00:21:16.676 align:middle line:84%
>>RM: And so, that
wasn't organic.

00:21:16.676 --> 00:21:19.145 align:middle line:84%
>>RP: Right, so, absolutely, so
we get woman in the workforce,

00:21:19.145 --> 00:21:20.947 align:middle line:84%
we double the tax rolls,
and we get the kids

00:21:20.947 --> 00:21:21.748 align:middle line:90%
out of the home earlier.

00:21:21.748 --> 00:21:23.116 align:middle line:90%
>>RM: Exactly.

00:21:23.116 --> 00:21:24.650 align:middle line:84%
>>RP: So, we get them into the
schools earlier, and we get.

00:21:24.650 --> 00:21:25.685 align:middle line:90%
>>RM: Indoctrination earlier.

00:21:25.685 --> 00:21:27.086 align:middle line:84%
>>RP: Get to grab
their minds earlier.

00:21:27.086 --> 00:21:28.354 align:middle line:90%
Right. Exactly.

00:21:28.354 --> 00:21:32.959 align:middle line:84%
So, related to that,
Betty Friedan releases the

00:21:32.959 --> 00:21:38.598 align:middle line:84%
"Feminine Mystique" in 1963,
just after the assassination

00:21:38.598 --> 00:21:42.168 align:middle line:84%
of John F. Kennedy, so now you
have the birth of feminism,

00:21:42.168 --> 00:21:44.337 align:middle line:90%
which takes place at that time.

00:21:44.337 --> 00:21:45.571 align:middle line:90%
You have feminism.

00:21:45.571 --> 00:21:49.008 align:middle line:84%
You have to birth of
the great society.

00:21:49.008 --> 00:21:53.112 align:middle line:84%
This is all Saturn and Aquarius
by the way, and it's kind

00:21:53.112 --> 00:21:58.718 align:middle line:84%
of this interesting yet
sort of synthetic version

00:21:58.718 --> 00:22:02.588 align:middle line:84%
of what the Age of
Aquarius could look like.

00:22:02.588 --> 00:22:05.892 align:middle line:84%
And, of course, they
were bringing that home.

00:22:05.892 --> 00:22:07.627 align:middle line:84%
They were liking bring
this message home.

00:22:07.627 --> 00:22:11.597 align:middle line:84%
This is the "Age of Aquarius",
the song by the Fifth Dimension,

00:22:11.597 --> 00:22:12.899 align:middle line:84%
I believe, it was written by
Mike Curr [assumed spelling]

00:22:12.899 --> 00:22:16.102 align:middle line:84%
>>RM: What would an organic
Age of Aquarius look like.

00:22:16.102 --> 00:22:16.803 align:middle line:90%
>>RP: At that time?

00:22:16.803 --> 00:22:18.104 align:middle line:90%
>>RM: Yes, at that time.

00:22:18.104 --> 00:22:20.440 align:middle line:84%
>>RP: Well, at that time,
an organic Age of Aquarius,

00:22:20.440 --> 00:22:22.375 align:middle line:84%
so what's interesting
is that Aquarius

00:22:22.375 --> 00:22:24.677 align:middle line:84%
and Leo are opposed
to one another.

00:22:24.677 --> 00:22:31.818 align:middle line:84%
And, Aquarius is revolutionary,
and it can be rather dramatic

00:22:31.818 --> 00:22:34.420 align:middle line:90%
in terms of its state changes.

00:22:34.420 --> 00:22:42.261 align:middle line:84%
A Leo-based Age of Aquarius,
I think, would have more

00:22:42.261 --> 00:22:48.935 align:middle line:84%
about potential and more about
empowerment, and more about kind

00:22:48.935 --> 00:22:52.672 align:middle line:84%
of what I would call
an organic equality.

00:22:52.672 --> 00:22:55.842 align:middle line:84%
Because if people are
organically empowered,

00:22:55.842 --> 00:22:58.711 align:middle line:84%
then guess what they get to do,
they get to live their dream.

00:22:58.711 --> 00:23:01.214 align:middle line:84%
They get to find their
own personal nitch.

00:23:01.214 --> 00:23:03.783 align:middle line:84%
They get to find what
they're good at in the world.

00:23:03.783 --> 00:23:08.454 align:middle line:84%
It's more about aspiration
at that point in time,

00:23:08.454 --> 00:23:11.257 align:middle line:84%
versus desperation, and there
were some desperate moments

00:23:11.257 --> 00:23:12.425 align:middle line:90%
in the 60's.

00:23:12.425 --> 00:23:13.626 align:middle line:90%
It felt like.

00:23:13.626 --> 00:23:14.694 align:middle line:84%
>>RM: It was horrible, and
all the assassinations.

00:23:14.694 --> 00:23:15.495 align:middle line:90%
>>RP: The assassinations.

00:23:15.495 --> 00:23:16.195 align:middle line:90%
It felt like the world was.

00:23:16.195 --> 00:23:17.330 align:middle line:90%
>>RM: So traumatizing.

00:23:17.330 --> 00:23:18.397 align:middle line:84%
>>RP: It felt like the
world was going to end,

00:23:18.397 --> 00:23:20.433 align:middle line:84%
and that would be
different, I think.

00:23:20.433 --> 00:23:23.569 align:middle line:84%
It would have been about
aspiration versus desperation.

00:23:23.569 --> 00:23:25.104 align:middle line:84%
>>RM: And so, what was
there that was showing

00:23:25.104 --> 00:23:29.275 align:middle line:84%
up in the astrology
that would have inspired

00:23:29.275 --> 00:23:30.977 align:middle line:90%
that path versus the other one.

00:23:30.977 --> 00:23:33.212 align:middle line:84%
Was there something, or
was it simply a corruption

00:23:33.212 --> 00:23:34.514 align:middle line:90%
in the program?

00:23:34.514 --> 00:23:36.983 align:middle line:84%
>>RP: Well, I mean I think
it was probably a corruption

00:23:36.983 --> 00:23:38.417 align:middle line:84%
in the program, but
I think that,

00:23:38.417 --> 00:23:42.788 align:middle line:84%
I think whoever is running
this hologram does this

00:23:42.788 --> 00:23:44.190 align:middle line:90%
from time to time.

00:23:44.190 --> 00:23:47.460 align:middle line:84%
Right. It was kind of like after
World War I, people thought,

00:23:47.460 --> 00:23:49.161 align:middle line:90%
well, that was a horrible war.

00:23:49.161 --> 00:23:50.796 align:middle line:84%
We're never going to have
another one of those.

00:23:50.796 --> 00:23:53.432 align:middle line:84%
Well, guess what, not long
after that, they're cranking

00:23:53.432 --> 00:23:57.503 align:middle line:84%
up the war machine again,
or perhaps it's the Titanic,

00:23:57.503 --> 00:24:03.709 align:middle line:84%
and eliminating the Astor family
out of the influential mix

00:24:03.709 --> 00:24:07.213 align:middle line:84%
of very wealthy American
families who might be able

00:24:07.213 --> 00:24:11.017 align:middle line:84%
to take on the Rothschild Empire
and the Rothschild Dynasty

00:24:11.017 --> 00:24:12.952 align:middle line:84%
which was coming in and
really changing the game

00:24:12.952 --> 00:24:14.453 align:middle line:84%
in the United States
at that time.

00:24:14.453 --> 00:24:17.356 align:middle line:84%
So, I think these
things happen over time.

00:24:17.356 --> 00:24:22.461 align:middle line:84%
These events come into play, and
we can talk maybe a little bit

00:24:22.461 --> 00:24:24.730 align:middle line:84%
about one that's just
happened recently.

00:24:24.730 --> 00:24:25.665 align:middle line:90%
>>RM: Let's do.

00:24:25.665 --> 00:24:26.599 align:middle line:84%
>>RP: Towards the
end of the show;

00:24:26.599 --> 00:24:27.767 align:middle line:84%
we could cap off
with that perhaps.

00:24:27.767 --> 00:24:29.535 align:middle line:84%
>>RM: Which one are
you referring to?

00:24:29.535 --> 00:24:30.836 align:middle line:90%
>>RP: Well, Turkey and Egypt.

00:24:30.836 --> 00:24:32.171 align:middle line:90%
>>RM: Okay, we will get there.

00:24:32.171 --> 00:24:33.372 align:middle line:90%
>>RP: We can go down there,

00:24:33.372 --> 00:24:35.374 align:middle line:84%
because I actually think
those are positive events.

00:24:35.374 --> 00:24:36.509 align:middle line:90%
>>RM: Yes.

00:24:36.509 --> 00:24:40.613 align:middle line:84%
>>RP: But, at that time,
Saturn was in Aquarius,

00:24:40.613 --> 00:24:43.416 align:middle line:90%
and Aquarius is the new age.

00:24:43.416 --> 00:24:44.550 align:middle line:90%
It's the dawn of the new age.

00:24:44.550 --> 00:24:46.686 align:middle line:90%
It's the bright new star.

00:24:46.686 --> 00:24:48.421 align:middle line:90%
Aquarius is related to Lucifer.

00:24:48.421 --> 00:24:51.057 align:middle line:84%
I mean that's what we're talking
about with the Age of Aquarius.

00:24:51.057 --> 00:24:53.059 align:middle line:84%
And, it's also, what's
interesting is,

00:24:53.059 --> 00:24:54.393 align:middle line:90%
that if you go back far enough,

00:24:54.393 --> 00:24:57.163 align:middle line:84%
you go back to the Bolshevik
Revolution, Saturn was also

00:24:57.163 --> 00:24:58.598 align:middle line:90%
in Aquarius at the same time.

00:24:58.598 --> 00:24:59.232 align:middle line:90%
>>RM: Interesting.

00:24:59.232 --> 00:25:00.533 align:middle line:90%
>>RP: Yeah.

00:25:00.533 --> 00:25:01.801 align:middle line:84%
>>RM: Although that was an
artificially inspired thing

00:25:01.801 --> 00:25:02.835 align:middle line:90%
by the same players.

00:25:02.835 --> 00:25:04.236 align:middle line:90%
>>RP: Absolutely.

00:25:04.236 --> 00:25:07.406 align:middle line:84%
So, what we are seeing here is
a redux of Saturn and Aquarius

00:25:07.406 --> 00:25:09.008 align:middle line:90%
at the beginning of the 60's.

00:25:09.008 --> 00:25:12.478 align:middle line:84%
The Beatles come in right
on the heels of the death

00:25:12.478 --> 00:25:15.948 align:middle line:84%
of John F. Kennedy, and I'm
pretty sure that the "Please,

00:25:15.948 --> 00:25:18.451 align:middle line:84%
Please Me", which
was their, I think,

00:25:18.451 --> 00:25:19.986 align:middle line:84%
their second release
in this country.

00:25:19.986 --> 00:25:24.857 align:middle line:84%
It was released in Canada on
11/22, which was Kennedy's.

00:25:24.857 --> 00:25:27.293 align:middle line:90%
>>RM: Date of his assassination.

00:25:27.293 --> 00:25:29.862 align:middle line:84%
>>RP: Absolutely, yeah, so now
the Beatles come into play,

00:25:29.862 --> 00:25:33.599 align:middle line:84%
and they bring this whole
concept of group consciousness,

00:25:33.599 --> 00:25:35.635 align:middle line:90%
right, through rock and roll.

00:25:35.635 --> 00:25:39.739 align:middle line:84%
And, they bring this whole class
of an assembly masses of people

00:25:39.739 --> 00:25:43.042 align:middle line:84%
with their concerts at Shay
Stadium or Candlestick.

00:25:43.042 --> 00:25:45.978 align:middle line:84%
Now, all of a sudden we're
moving into this kind

00:25:45.978 --> 00:25:50.850 align:middle line:84%
of Aquarian sort of
backwash of the, I mean,

00:25:50.850 --> 00:25:53.886 align:middle line:84%
the Beatles are right there
right after Kennedy dies.

00:25:53.886 --> 00:25:55.321 align:middle line:84%
I mean, they don't
even lose a breath.

00:25:55.321 --> 00:25:59.525 align:middle line:84%
It's like, you're like,
oh, here's the Beatles.

00:25:59.525 --> 00:26:02.762 align:middle line:84%
You know, and people are
buying this incredible hype.

00:26:02.762 --> 00:26:06.032 align:middle line:84%
By the way, I've read
stories that a lot of people

00:26:06.032 --> 00:26:09.135 align:middle line:84%
that were meeting the
Beatles at the airport,

00:26:09.135 --> 00:26:11.203 align:middle line:84%
I think it La Guardia,
they were hired.

00:26:11.203 --> 00:26:13.239 align:middle line:84%
>>RM: Oh, you're kidding,
those famous photographs?

00:26:13.239 --> 00:26:14.440 align:middle line:90%
>>RP: Yeah, they were hired.

00:26:14.440 --> 00:26:15.775 align:middle line:84%
>>RM: Of all the
screaming girls.

00:26:15.775 --> 00:26:17.043 align:middle line:90%
>>RP: Yeah, they were hired.

00:26:17.043 --> 00:26:18.077 align:middle line:84%
Right. Yeah, but that goes
back to Edward [inaudible]

00:26:18.077 --> 00:26:19.111 align:middle line:84%
>>RM: They didn't
have to hire anyone.

00:26:19.111 --> 00:26:20.146 align:middle line:84%
There were a lot of
people screaming.

00:26:20.146 --> 00:26:21.347 align:middle line:90%
Maybe not that early.

00:26:21.347 --> 00:26:22.214 align:middle line:90%
>>RP: They weren't really sure.

00:26:22.214 --> 00:26:23.315 align:middle line:90%
Maybe not.

00:26:23.315 --> 00:26:25.484 align:middle line:84%
They wanted to make
sure, but this is part

00:26:25.484 --> 00:26:27.153 align:middle line:90%
of this wave that comes through.

00:26:27.153 --> 00:26:29.121 align:middle line:84%
You have Betty Friedan
releasing the.

00:26:29.121 --> 00:26:30.690 align:middle line:90%
>>RM: "Feminine Mystique."

00:26:30.690 --> 00:26:33.893 align:middle line:84%
>>RP: "Feminine Mystique"
in 1963, the Great Society,

00:26:33.893 --> 00:26:36.362 align:middle line:84%
and all of a sudden, we're
in a very, we're, you know,

00:26:36.362 --> 00:26:38.831 align:middle line:84%
we're off into the
kind of the Dionysian,

00:26:38.831 --> 00:26:40.566 align:middle line:90%
sort of Aquarian vision,

00:26:40.566 --> 00:26:42.735 align:middle line:84%
where everybody is
doing their own thing,

00:26:42.735 --> 00:26:44.470 align:middle line:90%
and everybody's rebelling,

00:26:44.470 --> 00:26:47.406 align:middle line:84%
and everybody's having their
own personal revolution.

00:26:47.406 --> 00:26:49.308 align:middle line:84%
And, none of it's really
kind of coming together.

00:26:49.308 --> 00:26:51.844 align:middle line:84%
You have this moment of
Woodstock, I guess, maybe where.

00:26:51.844 --> 00:26:53.946 align:middle line:84%
>>RM: Well, Kent State, you
did have some rebellion.

00:26:53.946 --> 00:26:55.848 align:middle line:84%
>>RP: Well, Kent State
is rebellion for sure,

00:26:55.848 --> 00:26:58.751 align:middle line:84%
but it's not really the
kind of, Kent State is,

00:26:58.751 --> 00:27:00.219 align:middle line:90%
you know, it's a dead end.

00:27:00.219 --> 00:27:03.689 align:middle line:84%
There's a scene in "Easy
Rider", where Peter Fonda looks

00:27:03.689 --> 00:27:06.859 align:middle line:84%
at Dennis Hopper at the end of
the movie, and he says, he says,

00:27:06.859 --> 00:27:08.360 align:middle line:90%
you know I think we blew it.

00:27:08.360 --> 00:27:11.063 align:middle line:84%
You know, he's not talking
about their heroin trip

00:27:11.063 --> 00:27:13.499 align:middle line:84%
across the southern
part of the country.

00:27:13.499 --> 00:27:15.768 align:middle line:84%
He's really talking
about their generation,

00:27:15.768 --> 00:27:19.004 align:middle line:84%
and it's an interesting
aside, because the 60's

00:27:19.004 --> 00:27:20.840 align:middle line:84%
at that point are
coming to an end, right?

00:27:20.840 --> 00:27:25.010 align:middle line:84%
I believe "Easy Rider" was made
at the end of 69, early 1970,

00:27:25.010 --> 00:27:27.179 align:middle line:90%
so that door was closing.

00:27:27.179 --> 00:27:31.016 align:middle line:84%
And, I think it's a
really interesting insight

00:27:31.016 --> 00:27:34.453 align:middle line:84%
into what took place
during that time.

00:27:34.453 --> 00:27:37.423 align:middle line:84%
It's incredibly factious,
and you have all

00:27:37.423 --> 00:27:42.094 align:middle line:84%
of this fantastic potential
and energy, and it's moved

00:27:42.094 --> 00:27:43.529 align:middle line:90%
in various directions.

00:27:43.529 --> 00:27:47.366 align:middle line:84%
We have all of these splinter
movements that take place,

00:27:47.366 --> 00:27:51.170 align:middle line:84%
and you have; and I don't
really think the division

00:27:51.170 --> 00:27:55.975 align:middle line:84%
between the sexes has ever
really mended since the 1960's,

00:27:55.975 --> 00:27:57.943 align:middle line:84%
and even in this
country, the division

00:27:57.943 --> 00:28:00.913 align:middle line:84%
between the generations
hasn't mended either.

00:28:00.913 --> 00:28:03.682 align:middle line:84%
We look at age very
differently now.

00:28:03.682 --> 00:28:07.887 align:middle line:84%
We look at senior citizens and
elders without almost contempt

00:28:07.887 --> 00:28:11.624 align:middle line:84%
because they're old and they're
going to die, whereas prior

00:28:11.624 --> 00:28:13.592 align:middle line:84%
to that, they played
a very different role.

00:28:13.592 --> 00:28:15.060 align:middle line:84%
>>RM: In our families
and societies.

00:28:15.060 --> 00:28:15.761 align:middle line:90%
>>RP: In our families.

00:28:15.761 --> 00:28:16.595 align:middle line:90%
>>RM: Absolutely.

00:28:16.595 --> 00:28:18.464 align:middle line:90%
>>RP: Yeah, and unfortunately,

00:28:18.464 --> 00:28:20.666 align:middle line:84%
that has never been
really resolved.

00:28:20.666 --> 00:28:21.600 align:middle line:90%
>>RM: No.

00:28:21.600 --> 00:28:22.868 align:middle line:84%
>>RP: And what's
interesting now is

00:28:22.868 --> 00:28:24.603 align:middle line:84%
that the baby boomers are
now becoming those elders.

00:28:24.603 --> 00:28:25.171 align:middle line:90%
Right?

00:28:25.171 --> 00:28:25.871 align:middle line:90%
>>RM: Good luck.

00:28:25.871 --> 00:28:27.006 align:middle line:90%
Who's looking after you?

00:28:27.006 --> 00:28:28.374 align:middle line:84%
We've taught them such
good values [laughing]

00:28:28.374 --> 00:28:29.975 align:middle line:90%
>>RP: Right, radically.

00:28:29.975 --> 00:28:31.076 align:middle line:90%
>>RM: Just abandon them,

00:28:31.076 --> 00:28:32.878 align:middle line:84%
put them in a home
if you can afford it.

00:28:32.878 --> 00:28:33.445 align:middle line:90%
>>RP: Yeah.

00:28:33.445 --> 00:28:34.547 align:middle line:90%
>>RM: Not cool.

00:28:34.547 --> 00:28:36.081 align:middle line:84%
So, there's a little
karma coming around on

00:28:36.081 --> 00:28:37.616 align:middle line:90%
that one obviously speaking.

00:28:37.616 --> 00:28:40.686 align:middle line:84%
Yeah, okay so, let's talk
about what happened from there

00:28:40.686 --> 00:28:43.322 align:middle line:84%
when we went in, you mentioned
Nixon a little earlier,

00:28:43.322 --> 00:28:44.490 align:middle line:90%
and then into Reagan.

00:28:44.490 --> 00:28:47.092 align:middle line:84%
>>RP: Yeah, well,
this is interesting,

00:28:47.092 --> 00:28:53.399 align:middle line:84%
because with the baby boomers,
they decided kind of en masse

00:28:53.399 --> 00:28:55.601 align:middle line:84%
that they were not going
to be very material,

00:28:55.601 --> 00:28:58.838 align:middle line:90%
and corporations were concerned

00:28:58.838 --> 00:29:01.307 align:middle line:84%
that they wouldn't be
able to sell them things.

00:29:01.307 --> 00:29:03.442 align:middle line:84%
You're familiar with the
TV show, "Madmen", right?

00:29:03.442 --> 00:29:04.844 align:middle line:90%
>>RM: Yes.

00:29:04.844 --> 00:29:07.179 align:middle line:84%
>>RP: Okay, so in "Madmen", that
actually takes up a fair amount

00:29:07.179 --> 00:29:10.716 align:middle line:84%
of space; I think season like
four or five, and they're trying

00:29:10.716 --> 00:29:12.384 align:middle line:84%
to figure out how
they're going sell.

00:29:12.384 --> 00:29:14.086 align:middle line:84%
>>RM: They were trying
to sell cigarettes.

00:29:14.086 --> 00:29:15.154 align:middle line:90%
>>RP: Cigarettes.

00:29:15.154 --> 00:29:16.522 align:middle line:84%
>>RM: To a generation
who's saying, hey,

00:29:16.522 --> 00:29:18.023 align:middle line:90%
we want a healthier lifestyle.

00:29:18.023 --> 00:29:19.158 align:middle line:90%
>>RP: That's right.

00:29:19.158 --> 00:29:20.793 align:middle line:84%
>>RM: This thing should
have warning on them.

00:29:20.793 --> 00:29:23.162 align:middle line:84%
>>RP: So, that was
a real dilemma

00:29:23.162 --> 00:29:25.664 align:middle line:90%
for companies at that time.

00:29:25.664 --> 00:29:28.334 align:middle line:84%
They didn't know how to
deal with this group of kids

00:29:28.334 --> 00:29:31.337 align:middle line:84%
who weren't really all that
interested in buying things.

00:29:31.337 --> 00:29:32.471 align:middle line:90%
>>RM: Yeah.

00:29:32.471 --> 00:29:36.809 align:middle line:84%
>>RP: So, what happens
is, eventually, Reagan,

00:29:36.809 --> 00:29:39.879 align:middle line:84%
he's going to run for president,
and he's got to figure out how

00:29:39.879 --> 00:29:41.447 align:middle line:90%
to tap into this group.

00:29:41.447 --> 00:29:46.151 align:middle line:84%
How do we tap into, you
know, their lifestyle,

00:29:46.151 --> 00:29:50.656 align:middle line:84%
so what he did is, he hired
Stanford Research Institute.

00:29:50.656 --> 00:29:52.258 align:middle line:84%
Reagan is an Aquarius
by the way,

00:29:52.258 --> 00:29:54.660 align:middle line:84%
so now we have Aquarius
and Leo again, right?

00:29:54.660 --> 00:29:56.695 align:middle line:84%
>>RM: Now, that's
a CIA operation.

00:29:56.695 --> 00:29:59.164 align:middle line:84%
>>RP: Well, CIA West,
which is interesting.

00:29:59.164 --> 00:30:00.266 align:middle line:90%
>>RM: Right.

00:30:00.266 --> 00:30:01.233 align:middle line:84%
>>RP: Because that was
actually told to me

00:30:01.233 --> 00:30:01.901 align:middle line:84%
by a Stanford employee
at one time.

00:30:01.901 --> 00:30:03.302 align:middle line:90%
>>RM: Yep.

00:30:03.302 --> 00:30:08.707 align:middle line:84%
>>RP: So, anyway, he hired SRI
to get these punch cards out,

00:30:08.707 --> 00:30:12.177 align:middle line:84%
and send these punch cards
to potential voters, right?

00:30:12.177 --> 00:30:14.747 align:middle line:90%
And, it was to the baby boomers.

00:30:14.747 --> 00:30:17.449 align:middle line:84%
And so they got the punch
cards, and okay, I like this,

00:30:17.449 --> 00:30:19.285 align:middle line:90%
I like this, I like this.

00:30:19.285 --> 00:30:21.520 align:middle line:84%
And, so what they
were able to derive

00:30:21.520 --> 00:30:23.589 align:middle line:90%
from all this information was

00:30:23.589 --> 00:30:27.760 align:middle line:84%
that Reagan's people were very
smart, and he basically said,

00:30:27.760 --> 00:30:30.763 align:middle line:84%
hey look, we're going
to get out of the way.

00:30:30.763 --> 00:30:32.164 align:middle line:84%
We're not going to
do a whole lot.

00:30:32.164 --> 00:30:37.603 align:middle line:84%
We're going to let you guys do
what you do best, which is live

00:30:37.603 --> 00:30:41.407 align:middle line:84%
and start businesses, and
we're going to empower you

00:30:41.407 --> 00:30:45.344 align:middle line:84%
to do those things, and that's
what Reagan's speeches were all

00:30:45.344 --> 00:30:47.880 align:middle line:84%
about, and they're very
sophisticated speeches.

00:30:47.880 --> 00:30:50.816 align:middle line:84%
>>RM: Wasn't there a fair amount
of deregulation that went on.

00:30:50.816 --> 00:30:52.351 align:middle line:84%
>>RP: That's also
a big part of it.

00:30:52.351 --> 00:30:54.219 align:middle line:84%
They were going to make it
a lot easier for people.

00:30:54.219 --> 00:30:55.254 align:middle line:90%
>>RM: Easier to get money.

00:30:55.254 --> 00:30:56.956 align:middle line:84%
>>RP: To get money
in order to do that.

00:30:56.956 --> 00:31:00.526 align:middle line:84%
But, it also lined
up with their values.

00:31:00.526 --> 00:31:03.862 align:middle line:84%
It's like, hey, leave me
alone, let me do my thing.

00:31:03.862 --> 00:31:06.231 align:middle line:84%
I know how to run my show,
and Reagan basically,

00:31:06.231 --> 00:31:10.869 align:middle line:84%
and it's funny, because Reagan
was a pariah in the 60's.

00:31:10.869 --> 00:31:12.604 align:middle line:84%
I mean, he was the
governor of California.

00:31:12.604 --> 00:31:13.505 align:middle line:90%
He was hated.

00:31:13.505 --> 00:31:14.139 align:middle line:90%
>>RM: Oh, I know.

00:31:14.139 --> 00:31:15.240 align:middle line:90%
Yeah, he was.

00:31:15.240 --> 00:31:16.642 align:middle line:90%
>>RP: And yet, the same people

00:31:16.642 --> 00:31:18.811 align:middle line:84%
that ultimately hated
him, elected him.

00:31:18.811 --> 00:31:22.348 align:middle line:84%
It's really, it's
crazy, but it happened.

00:31:22.348 --> 00:31:24.750 align:middle line:84%
So, that's what happened
with Reagan

00:31:24.750 --> 00:31:26.485 align:middle line:90%
as he tapped into the boomers.

00:31:26.485 --> 00:31:30.422 align:middle line:84%
>>RM: So, that began kind of the
economic ball rolling in an age

00:31:30.422 --> 00:31:33.092 align:middle line:84%
where they're now reaching
empowerment, an empowered age.

00:31:33.092 --> 00:31:34.326 align:middle line:90%
>>RP: Yeah.

00:31:34.326 --> 00:31:35.661 align:middle line:84%
>>RM: Where this generation
can start, as you say,

00:31:35.661 --> 00:31:38.464 align:middle line:84%
creating their own businesses,
money's flowing easily,

00:31:38.464 --> 00:31:41.066 align:middle line:84%
regulations have been
put to the back burner.

00:31:41.066 --> 00:31:43.535 align:middle line:84%
>>RP: Well, what's interesting
is that Reagan comes;

00:31:43.535 --> 00:31:47.039 align:middle line:84%
he runs for President in
1980, he starts the 80's,

00:31:47.039 --> 00:31:50.275 align:middle line:84%
and prior to that, we have
10 years, really the 70's.

00:31:50.275 --> 00:31:53.779 align:middle line:84%
The 70's are when the baby
boomers kind of go to sleep.

00:31:53.779 --> 00:31:56.548 align:middle line:84%
They've, you know, they're
burned out on the 60's.

00:31:56.548 --> 00:31:58.283 align:middle line:90%
They're burned out on rebellion,

00:31:58.283 --> 00:32:02.221 align:middle line:84%
but they still have some core
values that they're working out.

00:32:02.221 --> 00:32:04.923 align:middle line:84%
You know, and that's when the
human potential movement comes

00:32:04.923 --> 00:32:06.158 align:middle line:90%
into play.

00:32:06.158 --> 00:32:08.594 align:middle line:84%
You know, people like Fritz
Perles coming to Esalen,

00:32:08.594 --> 00:32:13.165 align:middle line:84%
and you know, and teaching
transactual analysis and all

00:32:13.165 --> 00:32:16.535 align:middle line:84%
that good stuff, so this
is where they migrate

00:32:16.535 --> 00:32:19.171 align:middle line:84%
into is the human
potential world.

00:32:19.171 --> 00:32:22.708 align:middle line:84%
And, it allows them to still
stay in touch with their quest

00:32:22.708 --> 00:32:28.280 align:middle line:84%
to find themselves, but in a
very different kind of setting.

00:32:28.280 --> 00:32:31.083 align:middle line:84%
>>RM: What's occurring to
me as you're saying that is

00:32:31.083 --> 00:32:34.353 align:middle line:84%
that it was allowing people
to access on a very kind

00:32:34.353 --> 00:32:37.790 align:middle line:84%
of intellectual heady mental
level, not from the heart,

00:32:37.790 --> 00:32:41.326 align:middle line:84%
which is where the
groundswell of rebellion

00:32:41.326 --> 00:32:42.528 align:middle line:90%
or whatever you want to call it

00:32:42.528 --> 00:32:45.264 align:middle line:84%
for that generation
really was taking place.

00:32:45.264 --> 00:32:47.399 align:middle line:84%
It's like the heart got
nixed out of the whole thing,

00:32:47.399 --> 00:32:49.234 align:middle line:90%
and it turned into agendas.

00:32:49.234 --> 00:32:52.037 align:middle line:84%
>>RP: Well, it did seem to
morph into kind of a more

00:32:52.037 --> 00:32:54.006 align:middle line:84%
of an intellectual
and heavy path.

00:32:54.006 --> 00:32:59.178 align:middle line:84%
You have somebody like Werner
Erhard and EST, which anything

00:32:59.178 --> 00:33:01.213 align:middle line:84%
to do, it has nothing
to do with the heart.

00:33:01.213 --> 00:33:04.616 align:middle line:84%
It's all really head based,
very will based, and of course,

00:33:04.616 --> 00:33:07.252 align:middle line:84%
you have L. Ron Hubbard
and Scientology.

00:33:07.252 --> 00:33:10.689 align:middle line:84%
This also becomes very
popular post 1960s,

00:33:10.689 --> 00:33:15.160 align:middle line:84%
so you're absolutely right
on it with that notice, yep.

00:33:15.160 --> 00:33:16.862 align:middle line:84%
>>RM: Okay, so let's
continue that out.

00:33:16.862 --> 00:33:19.031 align:middle line:84%
Now, let's look at the next
10 years, because I want

00:33:19.031 --> 00:33:22.334 align:middle line:84%
to talk a little bit about the
Libra generation, a little bit,

00:33:22.334 --> 00:33:24.870 align:middle line:84%
and then about the Virgo
generation a little bit.

00:33:24.870 --> 00:33:26.405 align:middle line:84%
Because, they're kind
of lost in the shuffle.

00:33:26.405 --> 00:33:27.773 align:middle line:84%
Because in our next
conversation,

00:33:27.773 --> 00:33:31.076 align:middle line:84%
we're going into Generation
Y; this intriguing under 30's,

00:33:31.076 --> 00:33:34.379 align:middle line:84%
like what do we do with them
from a political point of view

00:33:34.379 --> 00:33:35.881 align:middle line:90%
for some of the elders.

00:33:35.881 --> 00:33:38.016 align:middle line:90%
So, go ahead on that one.

00:33:38.016 --> 00:33:41.553 align:middle line:84%
>>RP: Well, so before we
hit the Pluto and Virgo,

00:33:41.553 --> 00:33:44.423 align:middle line:84%
Pluto and Libra, I
think Bill Clinton.

00:33:44.423 --> 00:33:45.991 align:middle line:84%
>>RM: Oh, yes, I'm
sorry, I totally forgot.

00:33:45.991 --> 00:33:47.192 align:middle line:84%
>>RP: We've got to
talk about Clinton.

00:33:47.192 --> 00:33:48.160 align:middle line:90%
>>RM: Yes, Clinton.

00:33:48.160 --> 00:33:48.794 align:middle line:84%
>>RP: We got to talk
about Clinton.

00:33:48.794 --> 00:33:49.561 align:middle line:90%
>>RM: Absolutely.

00:33:49.561 --> 00:33:50.963 align:middle line:90%
>>RP: Because, he's a Leo.

00:33:50.963 --> 00:33:54.199 align:middle line:84%
What's fascinating is how much
Leo plays a role in the election

00:33:54.199 --> 00:33:57.102 align:middle line:90%
of presidents in our country.

00:33:57.102 --> 00:33:58.937 align:middle line:90%
Clinton was a Leo.

00:33:58.937 --> 00:34:01.039 align:middle line:90%
Supposedly, Obama's a Leo.

00:34:01.039 --> 00:34:03.709 align:middle line:84%
So, we have two out of the last
three presidents were Leo's,

00:34:03.709 --> 00:34:09.314 align:middle line:84%
and George Bush, Jr. is Leo
rising, so we have Leo again,

00:34:09.314 --> 00:34:14.753 align:middle line:84%
and Leo, of course is the sign
of kings and queens, and Clinton

00:34:14.753 --> 00:34:21.059 align:middle line:84%
and Obama have taken on
the role really of emperor,

00:34:21.059 --> 00:34:22.760 align:middle line:90%
you know and king and queen.

00:34:22.760 --> 00:34:24.662 align:middle line:84%
Well, emperor and
king of this country.

00:34:24.662 --> 00:34:29.635 align:middle line:84%
So, Clinton, I think
represents in a lot of ways,

00:34:29.635 --> 00:34:30.903 align:middle line:90%
the failure of the 60's,

00:34:30.903 --> 00:34:35.439 align:middle line:84%
and I don't think I'm
alone in this assumption.

00:34:35.439 --> 00:34:38.010 align:middle line:90%
If you look at what he did.

00:34:38.010 --> 00:34:42.981 align:middle line:84%
He came in as kind of
this iconic figurehead;

00:34:42.981 --> 00:34:47.619 align:middle line:84%
that is everything that the
60's were supposed to be about.

00:34:47.619 --> 00:34:48.987 align:middle line:90%
Like it's their time, right?

00:34:48.987 --> 00:34:50.455 align:middle line:90%
It's their time and power.

00:34:50.455 --> 00:34:53.258 align:middle line:84%
If you look at older
pictures of Bill and Hillary,

00:34:53.258 --> 00:34:54.392 align:middle line:90%
they look like hippies.

00:34:54.392 --> 00:34:57.763 align:middle line:84%
You know, he's sporting
a beard and long hair,

00:34:57.763 --> 00:34:59.264 align:middle line:90%
and she's got glasses.

00:34:59.264 --> 00:35:00.399 align:middle line:90%
>>RM: Yes.

00:35:00.399 --> 00:35:02.267 align:middle line:84%
>>RP: You know, so this
really lines up with.

00:35:02.267 --> 00:35:04.203 align:middle line:84%
>>RM: Sweetheart, a
romance from college.

00:35:04.203 --> 00:35:06.738 align:middle line:84%
>>RP: Yeah, exactly, this
lines up with this ideal

00:35:06.738 --> 00:35:08.106 align:middle line:90%
that hey, they're one of us.

00:35:08.106 --> 00:35:11.376 align:middle line:84%
Right? So, he comes into power,
and one of the first things

00:35:11.376 --> 00:35:16.548 align:middle line:84%
that he does it; this is in
1996, is he enacts NAFDA,

00:35:16.548 --> 00:35:19.751 align:middle line:84%
and NAFDA completely
changes the game.

00:35:19.751 --> 00:35:22.054 align:middle line:84%
It is the first stage
towards globalization

00:35:22.054 --> 00:35:24.523 align:middle line:90%
in the United States.

00:35:24.523 --> 00:35:25.524 align:middle line:90%
And, it's huge.

00:35:25.524 --> 00:35:28.060 align:middle line:90%
It's an enormous game changer.

00:35:28.060 --> 00:35:31.964 align:middle line:84%
I was in New Mexico recently and
I was talking to an apple farmer

00:35:31.964 --> 00:35:35.500 align:middle line:84%
in New Mexico, and the
apple farmer used to be able

00:35:35.500 --> 00:35:38.470 align:middle line:84%
to sell his apples
in Mexico, in Juarez.

00:35:38.470 --> 00:35:42.908 align:middle line:84%
He can't do that anymore
because when NAFDA was enacted,

00:35:42.908 --> 00:35:46.311 align:middle line:84%
he basically was told that hey,
this is off limits for you now.

00:35:46.311 --> 00:35:48.080 align:middle line:90%
This is not your zone.

00:35:48.080 --> 00:35:50.482 align:middle line:84%
You can't do what
you used to do.

00:35:50.482 --> 00:35:52.985 align:middle line:84%
So, now, he's got all these
apple orchards, and you know,

00:35:52.985 --> 00:35:54.653 align:middle line:84%
what's he going to do
with these apple orchards.

00:35:54.653 --> 00:35:56.922 align:middle line:84%
>>RM: It's not like Juarez
is any better off now.

00:35:56.922 --> 00:35:59.858 align:middle line:84%
>>RP: Well, no, this is true,
but now he couldn't make money.

00:35:59.858 --> 00:36:01.593 align:middle line:84%
He could not ply
his trade, right?

00:36:01.593 --> 00:36:02.995 align:middle line:90%
>>RM: Right.

00:36:02.995 --> 00:36:06.431 align:middle line:84%
>>RP: So, then, then he thinks
well maybe I can sell my apples

00:36:06.431 --> 00:36:09.101 align:middle line:84%
to manufacturers
here in this country.

00:36:09.101 --> 00:36:11.169 align:middle line:84%
Well, shortly after
NAFDA is enacted,

00:36:11.169 --> 00:36:14.106 align:middle line:84%
China gets most favored
nation trade status,

00:36:14.106 --> 00:36:17.309 align:middle line:84%
and now they're growing
the apples,

00:36:17.309 --> 00:36:21.747 align:middle line:84%
and 95% of the apple juice in
this country comes from China,

00:36:21.747 --> 00:36:24.216 align:middle line:84%
with extremely-high
arsenic levels by the way.

00:36:24.216 --> 00:36:25.317 align:middle line:90%
>>RM: Yes.

00:36:25.317 --> 00:36:27.386 align:middle line:84%
>>RP: So, this is all
on Clinton's watch,

00:36:27.386 --> 00:36:30.656 align:middle line:84%
and Clinton is basically
saying, look at this hand,

00:36:30.656 --> 00:36:32.824 align:middle line:84%
but don't look at what
this hand is doing.

00:36:32.824 --> 00:36:35.761 align:middle line:84%
This hand is playing the
saxophone while this hand is

00:36:35.761 --> 00:36:39.264 align:middle line:84%
pulling the lever for the bottom
of this country to fall out.

00:36:39.264 --> 00:36:41.867 align:middle line:84%
>>RM: At the same
time, on the streets,

00:36:41.867 --> 00:36:44.670 align:middle line:84%
people were snorting cocaine
and buying condominiums,

00:36:44.670 --> 00:36:46.204 align:middle line:90%
and the money was flowing.

00:36:46.204 --> 00:36:47.005 align:middle line:90%
>>RP: There's a lot of money.

00:36:47.005 --> 00:36:47.940 align:middle line:90%
>>RM: And the debt was down.

00:36:47.940 --> 00:36:49.141 align:middle line:84%
>>RP: And the debt
was done partly

00:36:49.141 --> 00:36:53.278 align:middle line:84%
because of what Paul
Volker did prior, you know,

00:36:53.278 --> 00:36:55.380 align:middle line:90%
raising interest rates to like.

00:36:55.380 --> 00:36:55.881 align:middle line:90%
>>RM: 14.

00:36:55.881 --> 00:36:56.682 align:middle line:90%
>>RP: 19.

00:36:56.682 --> 00:36:57.382 align:middle line:90%
>>RM: Yeah, I remember that.

00:36:57.382 --> 00:36:58.450 align:middle line:90%
>>RP: 19%, huge, right?

00:36:58.450 --> 00:36:59.217 align:middle line:90%
>>RM: Yes.

00:36:59.217 --> 00:37:00.419 align:middle line:90%
>>RP: So the debt is down,

00:37:00.419 --> 00:37:04.556 align:middle line:84%
but there are things
happening behind the scenes.

00:37:04.556 --> 00:37:07.492 align:middle line:84%
Catherine Austin Fitts
talks about how trillions

00:37:07.492 --> 00:37:10.595 align:middle line:84%
of dollars were moved out of
the country and into China,

00:37:10.595 --> 00:37:13.598 align:middle line:84%
and in order to make
up for that loss,

00:37:13.598 --> 00:37:16.001 align:middle line:84%
the Clinton administration
gets hooked on bubbles.

00:37:16.001 --> 00:37:20.005 align:middle line:84%
First they get hooked on the
.com bubble; all based on very,

00:37:20.005 --> 00:37:22.674 align:middle line:84%
very low interest rates
coming from the Fed.

00:37:22.674 --> 00:37:23.942 align:middle line:90%
And, then after that,

00:37:23.942 --> 00:37:26.678 align:middle line:84%
once Greenspan raised
the interest rates,

00:37:26.678 --> 00:37:29.114 align:middle line:90%
and money was hard to get,

00:37:29.114 --> 00:37:32.050 align:middle line:84%
then the next bubble that's
waiting is obviously the

00:37:32.050 --> 00:37:33.352 align:middle line:90%
housing bubble.

00:37:33.352 --> 00:37:34.953 align:middle line:84%
Well, there was the third
bubble, which was the worst,

00:37:34.953 --> 00:37:36.288 align:middle line:84%
and that was the
derivative bubble.

00:37:36.288 --> 00:37:37.622 align:middle line:90%
>>RM: Yes.

00:37:37.622 --> 00:37:39.324 align:middle line:84%
>>RP: That was the cancerous
tumors of the housing bubble

00:37:39.324 --> 00:37:41.927 align:middle line:84%
that people were
still making money on,

00:37:41.927 --> 00:37:44.129 align:middle line:90%
which was totally egregious.

00:37:44.129 --> 00:37:45.297 align:middle line:90%
But, that's what happened.

00:37:45.297 --> 00:37:48.266 align:middle line:84%
You know, they kept
people kind of hypnotized

00:37:48.266 --> 00:37:51.403 align:middle line:84%
in their [inaudible] with
the amount of money around.

00:37:51.403 --> 00:37:53.538 align:middle line:84%
And, if you look back
in terms of programming,

00:37:53.538 --> 00:37:55.640 align:middle line:84%
we're always talking
about programming, right?

00:37:55.640 --> 00:37:56.908 align:middle line:90%
>>RM: Yes.

00:37:56.908 --> 00:37:58.844 align:middle line:84%
>>RP: So, we're talking
about TV shows like "Dallas",

00:37:58.844 --> 00:38:01.046 align:middle line:90%
where we have gratuitous excess.

00:38:01.046 --> 00:38:02.247 align:middle line:90%
>>RM: Yes.

00:38:02.247 --> 00:38:03.348 align:middle line:84%
>>RP: And "Lifestyles
of the Rich and Famous".

00:38:03.348 --> 00:38:04.182 align:middle line:84%
>>RM: Oh, yeah, the
champagne was flowing.

00:38:04.182 --> 00:38:04.716 align:middle line:90%
>>RP: Right.

00:38:04.716 --> 00:38:05.917 align:middle line:90%
Absolutely.

00:38:05.917 --> 00:38:06.952 align:middle line:84%
>>RM: A lot of people
felt really good like gee,

00:38:06.952 --> 00:38:08.520 align:middle line:84%
what about the good
old Clinton days.

00:38:08.520 --> 00:38:10.055 align:middle line:84%
There was a lot of
money out there.

00:38:10.055 --> 00:38:11.590 align:middle line:90%
It was easy to get too.

00:38:11.590 --> 00:38:13.959 align:middle line:84%
Now the champagne
bubbles have burst too.

00:38:13.959 --> 00:38:15.360 align:middle line:90%
>>RP: Right.

00:38:15.360 --> 00:38:18.363 align:middle line:84%
So, I think that the failure of
the baby boomers or the Pluto

00:38:18.363 --> 00:38:21.967 align:middle line:84%
and Leo Generation is
exemplified by Bill Clinton

00:38:21.967 --> 00:38:25.070 align:middle line:84%
and what he did and did not
do during his presidency.

00:38:25.070 --> 00:38:26.471 align:middle line:90%
He was basically the lame duck

00:38:26.471 --> 00:38:28.707 align:middle line:84%
for the last two years
of his presidency.

00:38:28.707 --> 00:38:31.243 align:middle line:84%
I mean once the Lewinski
affair came in,

00:38:31.243 --> 00:38:32.344 align:middle line:90%
he couldn't do anything.

00:38:32.344 --> 00:38:35.080 align:middle line:84%
He was totally; his
hands were totally tied.

00:38:35.080 --> 00:38:36.481 align:middle line:90%
>>RM: So, here we are now,

00:38:36.481 --> 00:38:40.752 align:middle line:84%
boomers approaching
retirement, for example.

00:38:40.752 --> 00:38:42.954 align:middle line:84%
What is the potential
that's left there?

00:38:42.954 --> 00:38:46.224 align:middle line:84%
Is there something in that
idealistic core from the heart

00:38:46.224 --> 00:38:48.260 align:middle line:90%
that can still express itself

00:38:48.260 --> 00:38:51.063 align:middle line:84%
and salvage this
generation's legacy?

00:38:51.063 --> 00:38:52.097 align:middle line:90%
>>RP: Yeah, absolutely.

00:38:52.097 --> 00:38:54.366 align:middle line:84%
I mean, I think that
one of the things

00:38:54.366 --> 00:38:57.302 align:middle line:90%
that the baby boomer's need

00:38:57.302 --> 00:39:02.541 align:middle line:84%
to be re-inspired by
is their activism.

00:39:02.541 --> 00:39:06.878 align:middle line:84%
Because, this was a generation
that was raised on some form

00:39:06.878 --> 00:39:10.515 align:middle line:84%
of activism, whether it
was activism for the sexes

00:39:10.515 --> 00:39:14.052 align:middle line:84%
or for racial equality, or
for the ending of the war,

00:39:14.052 --> 00:39:18.457 align:middle line:84%
it's part of the cultural
DNA for this generation.

00:39:18.457 --> 00:39:23.094 align:middle line:84%
So, there are plenty of, you
know, really powerful and just

00:39:23.094 --> 00:39:26.398 align:middle line:84%
and profound causes that
you know, Pluto and Leo

00:39:26.398 --> 00:39:28.400 align:middle line:84%
and the baby boomers
can tap into.

00:39:28.400 --> 00:39:32.370 align:middle line:84%
Specifically, in my mind,
the whole issue around food

00:39:32.370 --> 00:39:35.674 align:middle line:84%
and genetically-modified
organisms, and Monsanto.

00:39:35.674 --> 00:39:39.444 align:middle line:84%
I mean, I don't think there's
anybody who will disagree

00:39:39.444 --> 00:39:41.379 align:middle line:84%
on the fact that
we need clean food.

00:39:41.379 --> 00:39:42.514 align:middle line:90%
I mean, the whole idea

00:39:42.514 --> 00:39:45.150 align:middle line:84%
of organic food is
kind of absurd anyway.

00:39:45.150 --> 00:39:46.952 align:middle line:90%
It's just food, right?

00:39:46.952 --> 00:39:47.719 align:middle line:90%
>>RM: Right.

00:39:47.719 --> 00:39:48.553 align:middle line:90%
>>RP: And we've elevated.

00:39:48.553 --> 00:39:49.888 align:middle line:90%
>>RM: Real food.

00:39:49.888 --> 00:39:51.089 align:middle line:84%
>>RP: It's just real food
like the way food used to be.

00:39:51.089 --> 00:39:51.923 align:middle line:90%
>>RM: Yes.

00:39:51.923 --> 00:39:52.924 align:middle line:90%
>>RP: And now, all of a sudden,

00:39:52.924 --> 00:39:55.260 align:middle line:84%
it's this really
special thing, right?

00:39:55.260 --> 00:40:00.432 align:middle line:84%
[laughter] So, but Monsanto is
pernicious, and I think if Pluto

00:40:00.432 --> 00:40:04.669 align:middle line:84%
and Leo really wanted to
have a soul check and say,

00:40:04.669 --> 00:40:05.871 align:middle line:90%
is my mission complete?

00:40:05.871 --> 00:40:07.806 align:middle line:90%
Did I do what I came here to do?

00:40:07.806 --> 00:40:11.510 align:middle line:84%
Is the world a better place
because of me and my generation?

00:40:11.510 --> 00:40:16.481 align:middle line:84%
If the answer is maybe or even
no, then perhaps it's time to.

00:40:16.481 --> 00:40:17.282 align:middle line:90%
>>RM: Change course.

00:40:17.282 --> 00:40:17.816 align:middle line:90%
>>RP: Yeah.

00:40:17.816 --> 00:40:18.850 align:middle line:90%
>>RM: Yeah.

00:40:18.850 --> 00:40:20.285 align:middle line:84%
>>RP: To say, hey
look, I'm concerned.

00:40:20.285 --> 00:40:23.822 align:middle line:84%
I want my grandkids or my
great grandkids to live

00:40:23.822 --> 00:40:25.924 align:middle line:90%
in a world where food is real.

00:40:25.924 --> 00:40:29.094 align:middle line:84%
Food is not some strange
and synthetic thing.

00:40:29.094 --> 00:40:32.264 align:middle line:84%
I want to live in a world
where bees fly around.

00:40:32.264 --> 00:40:34.799 align:middle line:84%
You know, I don't want
to have to have my kid

00:40:34.799 --> 00:40:38.637 align:middle line:84%
or my great grandkid never see
a bee, or have to have some kind

00:40:38.637 --> 00:40:41.006 align:middle line:84%
of food that doesn't require
any kind of pollination.

00:40:41.006 --> 00:40:43.441 align:middle line:90%
I mean, that's a nightmare.

00:40:43.441 --> 00:40:47.913 align:middle line:84%
So, maybe, you know, maybe
this kind of look inside

00:40:47.913 --> 00:40:51.149 align:middle line:84%
for the Pluto and Leo
Generation will matter,

00:40:51.149 --> 00:40:52.217 align:middle line:90%
will mean something.

00:40:52.217 --> 00:40:54.519 align:middle line:84%
You know, I was talking
to Charles Osman,

00:40:54.519 --> 00:40:55.921 align:middle line:90%
a very interesting guy.

00:40:55.921 --> 00:41:00.525 align:middle line:84%
He's a futurist, and Charles is
very involved in hydroponics,

00:41:00.525 --> 00:41:04.029 align:middle line:84%
and we were talking about
how there are huge spaces,

00:41:04.029 --> 00:41:05.463 align:middle line:90%
places like Detroit,

00:41:05.463 --> 00:41:07.666 align:middle line:84%
where there's just
abandoned warehouses,

00:41:07.666 --> 00:41:11.169 align:middle line:84%
and abandoned manufacturing
plants.

00:41:11.169 --> 00:41:15.674 align:middle line:84%
Those places could be turned
into hydroponics garden.

00:41:15.674 --> 00:41:18.543 align:middle line:84%
We could have a whole
new economy

00:41:18.543 --> 00:41:21.613 align:middle line:90%
within these inner cities.

00:41:21.613 --> 00:41:25.817 align:middle line:84%
I'm not sure how easy it
would be to do that, but Pluto

00:41:25.817 --> 00:41:29.254 align:middle line:84%
and Leo is a generation
that is born on passion,

00:41:29.254 --> 00:41:30.555 align:middle line:90%
and Leo is a fixed sign.

00:41:30.555 --> 00:41:33.325 align:middle line:84%
So, if they decided that
they wanted to do something,

00:41:33.325 --> 00:41:35.360 align:middle line:84%
I think that they could
accomplish something along

00:41:35.360 --> 00:41:36.194 align:middle line:90%
those lines.

00:41:36.194 --> 00:41:37.662 align:middle line:90%
They could look around, and say,

00:41:37.662 --> 00:41:39.097 align:middle line:84%
where can we make
a difference still?

00:41:39.097 --> 00:41:40.665 align:middle line:90%
I think that's important.

00:41:40.665 --> 00:41:44.536 align:middle line:84%
>>RM: Okay, well now, shall we
move onto the next generation?

00:41:44.536 --> 00:41:46.338 align:middle line:84%
>>RP: Well, Pluto and
Virgo, that's my generation.

00:41:46.338 --> 00:41:47.572 align:middle line:90%
>>RM: Yes.

00:41:47.572 --> 00:41:50.408 align:middle line:84%
>>RP: And we grew up in the
shadow of Pluto and Leo,

00:41:50.408 --> 00:41:55.246 align:middle line:84%
and so we were actually kind
of entrained in some ways based

00:41:55.246 --> 00:41:59.284 align:middle line:84%
on some of the values
that were being floated

00:41:59.284 --> 00:42:00.619 align:middle line:90%
around during that time.

00:42:00.619 --> 00:42:03.221 align:middle line:84%
I lived very close to San
Francisco as a kid, so you know,

00:42:03.221 --> 00:42:06.658 align:middle line:84%
I could literally smell the
summer of love from my backyard.

00:42:06.658 --> 00:42:09.227 align:middle line:84%
And, so things like
the environment

00:42:09.227 --> 00:42:13.398 align:middle line:90%
and treating people kindly.

00:42:13.398 --> 00:42:17.302 align:middle line:84%
You know, there was something
about that that we were taking

00:42:17.302 --> 00:42:20.972 align:middle line:84%
in at that time, but
by the time, you know,

00:42:20.972 --> 00:42:23.575 align:middle line:84%
got to high school, or
by the time, you know,

00:42:23.575 --> 00:42:26.978 align:middle line:84%
we became of age, the world
was nothing like that at all.

00:42:26.978 --> 00:42:30.348 align:middle line:84%
You know, we were raised
thinking that perhaps it's going

00:42:30.348 --> 00:42:32.917 align:middle line:84%
to go in this direction,
and then we get Nixon

00:42:32.917 --> 00:42:35.654 align:middle line:84%
and we get Watergate,
and all of a sudden,

00:42:35.654 --> 00:42:38.456 align:middle line:84%
the world becomes a
much more cynical place.

00:42:38.456 --> 00:42:41.626 align:middle line:84%
We're not as interested in
becoming involved in things.

00:42:41.626 --> 00:42:46.331 align:middle line:84%
We're a lot more detached than
the Pluto and Leo Generation.

00:42:46.331 --> 00:42:50.502 align:middle line:84%
You know, our film for Pluto
and Virgo is Mary Poppins.

00:42:50.502 --> 00:42:51.269 align:middle line:90%
Right, that's our.

00:42:51.269 --> 00:42:53.171 align:middle line:90%
>>RM: Whoa, whoa, how so?

00:42:53.171 --> 00:42:57.409 align:middle line:84%
>>RP: Well, okay, so Pluto
and Virgo, Virgo is associated

00:42:57.409 --> 00:43:00.612 align:middle line:84%
with service; like finding your
purpose, finding your dharma,

00:43:00.612 --> 00:43:02.514 align:middle line:84%
and then serving
from that place,

00:43:02.514 --> 00:43:05.450 align:middle line:84%
like elevating your
service to a vocation.

00:43:05.450 --> 00:43:07.152 align:middle line:84%
>>RM: Well that movie
had elevated service.

00:43:07.152 --> 00:43:08.687 align:middle line:90%
Everyone is happy and dancing.

00:43:08.687 --> 00:43:09.888 align:middle line:84%
>>RP: Right, everybody
is happy and dancing,

00:43:09.888 --> 00:43:11.289 align:middle line:90%
and penguins are jumping around.

00:43:11.289 --> 00:43:12.691 align:middle line:90%
>>RM: Sweep the chimney.

00:43:12.691 --> 00:43:15.093 align:middle line:84%
>>RP: Right, but Mary
Poppins, what does she do?

00:43:15.093 --> 00:43:17.195 align:middle line:90%
She's a nanny.

00:43:17.195 --> 00:43:19.931 align:middle line:84%
It's a very service-oriented
deal, right?

00:43:19.931 --> 00:43:22.467 align:middle line:84%
And, her boyfriend is
a chimney sweep, right?

00:43:22.467 --> 00:43:24.402 align:middle line:84%
But, he's a warlock and
she's a witch, right?

00:43:24.402 --> 00:43:25.437 align:middle line:90%
So, it's cool.

00:43:25.437 --> 00:43:26.604 align:middle line:90%
You can do these things,

00:43:26.604 --> 00:43:29.340 align:middle line:84%
and still have your
secret powers on the side.

00:43:29.340 --> 00:43:31.743 align:middle line:84%
So, that's like, you know,
take, you know, take the job

00:43:31.743 --> 00:43:33.545 align:middle line:84%
at Starbuck's, and you
know, cast some spells.

00:43:33.545 --> 00:43:34.913 align:middle line:90%
I mean, that's our generation.

00:43:34.913 --> 00:43:40.452 align:middle line:84%
This is what we were raised
on, and we were, you know.

00:43:40.452 --> 00:43:43.388 align:middle line:84%
It was given to us so
that we could be anything

00:43:43.388 --> 00:43:44.622 align:middle line:90%
that we wanted.

00:43:44.622 --> 00:43:47.592 align:middle line:84%
But, to get to that
point, we had to navigate

00:43:47.592 --> 00:43:50.862 align:middle line:84%
through some very strange
kind of psychic terrain.

00:43:50.862 --> 00:43:54.632 align:middle line:84%
You know, I watched the
Vietnam War as a kid growing up.

00:43:54.632 --> 00:43:55.500 align:middle line:90%
>>RM: On TV.

00:43:55.500 --> 00:43:56.634 align:middle line:90%
>>RP: On TV.

00:43:56.634 --> 00:43:59.938 align:middle line:84%
You don't get that now
for a number of reasons,

00:43:59.938 --> 00:44:02.307 align:middle line:90%
because people would be shocked,

00:44:02.307 --> 00:44:03.908 align:middle line:84%
and you'd have an
antiwar movement

00:44:03.908 --> 00:44:05.276 align:middle line:90%
like you wouldn't believe.

00:44:05.276 --> 00:44:09.514 align:middle line:84%
So, I saw that, and a lot of
other kids my age saw that.

00:44:09.514 --> 00:44:11.716 align:middle line:84%
So, there was a slight
bit of disillusionment

00:44:11.716 --> 00:44:14.786 align:middle line:84%
that I think we had to through;
first Watergate and Nixon,

00:44:14.786 --> 00:44:18.490 align:middle line:84%
so by the time we're
coming out of college,

00:44:18.490 --> 00:44:19.624 align:middle line:90%
we're in this really strange.

00:44:19.624 --> 00:44:22.927 align:middle line:84%
We're called Generation
O or Generation Jones.

00:44:22.927 --> 00:44:26.231 align:middle line:84%
We have really kind of
no identity in some ways.

00:44:26.231 --> 00:44:27.332 align:middle line:90%
We come out of college

00:44:27.332 --> 00:44:31.035 align:middle line:84%
and computers really
aren't quite there yet.

00:44:31.035 --> 00:44:35.173 align:middle line:84%
We know, we're still in this
strained kind of inner zone

00:44:35.173 --> 00:44:38.843 align:middle line:84%
between one social economy
and the new social economy

00:44:38.843 --> 00:44:41.179 align:middle line:84%
which takes place
during Pluto and Libra,

00:44:41.179 --> 00:44:42.781 align:middle line:90%
and they're all about computers.

00:44:42.781 --> 00:44:45.416 align:middle line:84%
They're the kids that really
get their hands on computers

00:44:45.416 --> 00:44:47.285 align:middle line:84%
for the first time, and
that's where you get,

00:44:47.285 --> 00:44:49.554 align:middle line:84%
you know the founders
like things like Napster.

00:44:49.554 --> 00:44:50.155 align:middle line:90%
>>RM: Right.

00:44:50.155 --> 00:44:50.989 align:middle line:90%
>>RP: Yeah.

00:44:50.989 --> 00:44:53.224 align:middle line:90%
>>RM: Well, it was interesting

00:44:53.224 --> 00:44:55.160 align:middle line:84%
on a layered effect
generationally.

00:44:55.160 --> 00:44:59.531 align:middle line:84%
So, you have the Pluto and Leo
Generation, which is jubilant

00:44:59.531 --> 00:45:01.466 align:middle line:90%
over the ousting of Nixon.

00:45:01.466 --> 00:45:02.700 align:middle line:90%
Oh, we did it, we did it.

00:45:02.700 --> 00:45:04.102 align:middle line:90%
>>RP: That's right.

00:45:04.102 --> 00:45:05.570 align:middle line:84%
>>RM: And you guys are thinking,
wow, what a bunch of scumbags.

00:45:05.570 --> 00:45:07.872 align:middle line:84%
It's not like, because
you didn't do it per se,

00:45:07.872 --> 00:45:09.340 align:middle line:84%
you're just watching
it thinking wow.

00:45:09.340 --> 00:45:13.611 align:middle line:84%
>>RP: Well, I think that there's
some resentment towards the

00:45:13.611 --> 00:45:15.613 align:middle line:90%
Pluto and Leo Generation.

00:45:15.613 --> 00:45:19.484 align:middle line:84%
There's another astrologer
who does some work on this,

00:45:19.484 --> 00:45:24.789 align:middle line:84%
and he is vehement that
as soon as the Pluto

00:45:24.789 --> 00:45:26.758 align:middle line:84%
and Leo Generation
leaves the planet,

00:45:26.758 --> 00:45:28.226 align:middle line:84%
the world will be
a better place.

00:45:28.226 --> 00:45:30.962 align:middle line:84%
[laughter] And, I'm not
talking, he's not talking

00:45:30.962 --> 00:45:32.197 align:middle line:90%
about this in tongue in cheek.

00:45:32.197 --> 00:45:34.866 align:middle line:90%
He's being very serious.

00:45:34.866 --> 00:45:38.603 align:middle line:84%
And, I, you know, and I had to
drop him as a Facebook friend,

00:45:38.603 --> 00:45:41.472 align:middle line:84%
and he was a colleague,
because he was too fascist

00:45:41.472 --> 00:45:43.541 align:middle line:90%
around this whole thing, right?

00:45:43.541 --> 00:45:47.745 align:middle line:84%
But, I think that that is
endemic of some of the feelings.

00:45:47.745 --> 00:45:52.016 align:middle line:84%
It's like, you know, you
guys were the first kids.

00:45:52.016 --> 00:45:53.685 align:middle line:90%
You were first to the party.

00:45:53.685 --> 00:45:55.787 align:middle line:84%
You had all the good, you know,
you got all the good pieces

00:45:55.787 --> 00:45:58.223 align:middle line:84%
of cake, and there really
wasn't a lot left for us.

00:45:58.223 --> 00:45:59.424 align:middle line:90%
>>RM: Yeah, fair enough.

00:45:59.424 --> 00:46:02.927 align:middle line:84%
>>RP: And, so I think
that there is some of that

00:46:02.927 --> 00:46:06.564 align:middle line:84%
with my generation, but my
generation, we're interesting.

00:46:06.564 --> 00:46:09.133 align:middle line:84%
You know, we have
Neptune and Scorpio.

00:46:09.133 --> 00:46:10.235 align:middle line:90%
>>RM: What's that mean?

00:46:10.235 --> 00:46:12.203 align:middle line:84%
>>RP: Well, we're a
very psychic generation.

00:46:12.203 --> 00:46:17.609 align:middle line:84%
We are a generation that is
very into ESP and telepathy,

00:46:17.609 --> 00:46:21.579 align:middle line:84%
and we're kind of a precursor
for the Pluto and Scorpio kids.

00:46:21.579 --> 00:46:24.516 align:middle line:84%
You know, we were also
very into drugs by the way.

00:46:24.516 --> 00:46:25.516 align:middle line:90%
>>RM: Yeah.

00:46:25.516 --> 00:46:27.652 align:middle line:84%
>>RP: "Dazed and
Confused" is a document.

00:46:27.652 --> 00:46:28.953 align:middle line:84%
>>RM: Another one
of your movies.

00:46:28.953 --> 00:46:31.823 align:middle line:84%
>>RP: But again, why
were we into drugs?

00:46:31.823 --> 00:46:36.895 align:middle line:84%
Because drugs were glamorized
by the Pluto and Leo Generation,

00:46:36.895 --> 00:46:39.964 align:middle line:84%
and quite frankly, they were
the ones selling the drugs.

00:46:39.964 --> 00:46:41.299 align:middle line:90%
>>RM: Yes, they were.

00:46:41.299 --> 00:46:43.434 align:middle line:84%
>>RP: So, you know, this is,
you know, we had a pipeline,

00:46:43.434 --> 00:46:45.169 align:middle line:84%
and they were great
drugs at that time.

00:46:45.169 --> 00:46:47.572 align:middle line:84%
Marijuana's still
coming from Vietnam,

00:46:47.572 --> 00:46:49.440 align:middle line:90%
and you know, it was Thailand.

00:46:49.440 --> 00:46:51.376 align:middle line:84%
You know, it was a
whole different world,

00:46:51.376 --> 00:46:53.945 align:middle line:90%
and there was a consciousness.

00:46:53.945 --> 00:46:55.580 align:middle line:84%
"High Times Magazine"
was put out.

00:46:55.580 --> 00:46:56.681 align:middle line:90%
>>RM: Yes.

00:46:56.681 --> 00:46:58.082 align:middle line:84%
>>RP: I used to get
"High Times Magazine",

00:46:58.082 --> 00:47:00.652 align:middle line:84%
so we were deeply influenced by
this, but because we had Neptune

00:47:00.652 --> 00:47:02.420 align:middle line:90%
and Scorpio, we were open to it.

00:47:02.420 --> 00:47:03.955 align:middle line:90%
You know, we were like, okay,

00:47:03.955 --> 00:47:05.723 align:middle line:84%
let's experiment,
let's play around.

00:47:05.723 --> 00:47:07.792 align:middle line:84%
>>RM: But, you still had
no power, no real power.

00:47:07.792 --> 00:47:10.328 align:middle line:84%
>>RP: Not necessarily,
no, but I think right now,

00:47:10.328 --> 00:47:13.197 align:middle line:90%
our generation is coming around.

00:47:13.197 --> 00:47:17.302 align:middle line:84%
Now, one could say that Obama
is symbolic of our generation.

00:47:17.302 --> 00:47:21.005 align:middle line:84%
He is Pluto and Virgo,
I'm sorry to say.

00:47:21.005 --> 00:47:22.340 align:middle line:84%
>>RM: But, we don't
know what he is.

00:47:22.340 --> 00:47:23.174 align:middle line:90%
He's controlled.

00:47:23.174 --> 00:47:24.375 align:middle line:90%
We don't even know what he is.

00:47:24.375 --> 00:47:26.477 align:middle line:84%
>>RP: I would say that
likely, based on his age,

00:47:26.477 --> 00:47:29.280 align:middle line:90%
he's probably Pluto and Virgo.

00:47:29.280 --> 00:47:32.517 align:middle line:84%
We know that he had
some high school time.

00:47:32.517 --> 00:47:35.320 align:middle line:84%
We can track the high
school time in Hawaii.

00:47:35.320 --> 00:47:36.721 align:middle line:90%
That much we know.

00:47:36.721 --> 00:47:41.292 align:middle line:84%
Okay? After that, it becomes a
very sketchy trail to follow.

00:47:41.292 --> 00:47:42.594 align:middle line:90%
>>RM: Right.

00:47:42.594 --> 00:47:45.763 align:middle line:84%
>>RP: So, he is Pluto and
Virgo, and unlike the Pluto

00:47:45.763 --> 00:47:49.667 align:middle line:84%
and Leo people who, you know,
loved Bill Clinton in office,

00:47:49.667 --> 00:47:54.439 align:middle line:84%
I don't think Obama is having
the same kind of reception.

00:47:54.439 --> 00:47:59.010 align:middle line:84%
I think he is actually being
a little more well liked

00:47:59.010 --> 00:48:00.578 align:middle line:84%
by the Pluto and
Libra Generation.

00:48:00.578 --> 00:48:02.146 align:middle line:90%
That's my sense.

00:48:02.146 --> 00:48:03.414 align:middle line:90%
>>RM: That's interesting.

00:48:03.414 --> 00:48:05.049 align:middle line:84%
Let's talk about the Pluto
and Libra Generation.

00:48:05.049 --> 00:48:08.319 align:middle line:84%
Now, we're talking about
the people that are

00:48:08.319 --> 00:48:09.554 align:middle line:90%
from what age to what age.

00:48:09.554 --> 00:48:11.189 align:middle line:90%
Something down to 31.

00:48:11.189 --> 00:48:12.557 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:48:12.557 --> 00:48:19.564 align:middle line:84%
>>RP: Pluto and Libra is roughly
1970 to 1984, and they are,

00:48:19.564 --> 00:48:23.234 align:middle line:84%
they're fascinating,
because they grew

00:48:23.234 --> 00:48:24.769 align:middle line:90%
up in the greed is good era.

00:48:24.769 --> 00:48:27.772 align:middle line:84%
They grew up in trickledown
economics.

00:48:27.772 --> 00:48:31.075 align:middle line:84%
There was actually a lot of
money for them at one point

00:48:31.075 --> 00:48:35.179 align:middle line:84%
in time during their, you
know, their kind of ascendency.

00:48:35.179 --> 00:48:39.150 align:middle line:84%
So, they don't have the
same kinds of values

00:48:39.150 --> 00:48:42.553 align:middle line:84%
that the 60's generation
or Pluto or Leo,

00:48:42.553 --> 00:48:44.822 align:middle line:84%
or even the Pluto
and Virgo kids have.

00:48:44.822 --> 00:48:49.694 align:middle line:84%
They're fairly removed from
that Zeitgeist, and in fact,

00:48:49.694 --> 00:48:53.664 align:middle line:84%
their parents tend to be
the Pluto and Leo parents,

00:48:53.664 --> 00:48:55.099 align:middle line:84%
and they rebel from
their parents.

00:48:55.099 --> 00:48:57.301 align:middle line:84%
Oh, my Mom, she's going to
another channeling session.

00:48:57.301 --> 00:48:58.670 align:middle line:84%
What am I going to
do with her, right?

00:48:58.670 --> 00:48:59.737 align:middle line:90%
>>RM: Yeah, exactly.

00:48:59.737 --> 00:49:01.706 align:middle line:84%
>>RP: So, they go in
the other direction.

00:49:01.706 --> 00:49:04.409 align:middle line:84%
You know, they become
entrepreneurial.

00:49:04.409 --> 00:49:07.311 align:middle line:84%
They're the first generation
that really takes hold

00:49:07.311 --> 00:49:09.013 align:middle line:90%
of entrepreneurialism.

00:49:09.013 --> 00:49:11.182 align:middle line:90%
What's that TV show, Family.

00:49:11.182 --> 00:49:11.883 align:middle line:90%
>>RM: The .comers.

00:49:11.883 --> 00:49:12.583 align:middle line:90%
A lot of the .comers.

00:49:12.583 --> 00:49:13.418 align:middle line:90%
>>RP: .comers.

00:49:13.418 --> 00:49:14.385 align:middle line:90%
Their all from Pluto and Libra.

00:49:14.385 --> 00:49:15.586 align:middle line:84%
Their Pluto and Libra
rock stars.

00:49:15.586 --> 00:49:17.321 align:middle line:90%
"Family Ties".

00:49:17.321 --> 00:49:18.589 align:middle line:90%
Remember "Family Ties"?

00:49:18.589 --> 00:49:20.091 align:middle line:84%
>>RM: I never saw it,
but I remember it.

00:49:20.091 --> 00:49:21.325 align:middle line:90%
>>RP: Michael J. Fox.

00:49:21.325 --> 00:49:23.995 align:middle line:84%
He is the symbol
for that generation.

00:49:23.995 --> 00:49:26.397 align:middle line:84%
He's the kid in the family
that's all about money.

00:49:26.397 --> 00:49:27.198 align:middle line:90%
>>RM: The money, yeah.

00:49:27.198 --> 00:49:28.032 align:middle line:90%
>>RP: He's all about money.

00:49:28.032 --> 00:49:30.735 align:middle line:90%
So, he informs their generation.

00:49:30.735 --> 00:49:34.072 align:middle line:84%
He is symbolic of their
generation to a large extent.

00:49:34.072 --> 00:49:37.875 align:middle line:84%
And, actually, you can see
him as a very popular figure

00:49:37.875 --> 00:49:40.011 align:middle line:84%
in their generation,
with "Back to the Future"

00:49:40.011 --> 00:49:41.579 align:middle line:84%
and "Teen Wolf" and
things like that.

00:49:41.579 --> 00:49:43.815 align:middle line:84%
>>RM: There's this
huge retro trend.

00:49:43.815 --> 00:49:44.682 align:middle line:90%
I mean, for the women.

00:49:44.682 --> 00:49:46.050 align:middle line:90%
I don't know about for the guys.

00:49:46.050 --> 00:49:47.719 align:middle line:90%
That's kind of a metro sexual,

00:49:47.719 --> 00:49:49.220 align:middle line:84%
beginning of the
metro sexual thing.

00:49:49.220 --> 00:49:52.056 align:middle line:84%
But, for the women, you have
little aprons and cupcakes,

00:49:52.056 --> 00:49:55.359 align:middle line:84%
and clotheslines you can pin
your close on to air dry.

00:49:55.359 --> 00:49:59.464 align:middle line:84%
That's, there it's
supporting that.

00:49:59.464 --> 00:50:01.766 align:middle line:84%
>>RP: Well, I mean, I think that
what Pluto and Libra is trying

00:50:01.766 --> 00:50:04.368 align:middle line:84%
to do, and always tries to do it
to bring balance into situation.

00:50:04.368 --> 00:50:08.339 align:middle line:84%
>>RM: So, maybe it's
bringing back the comforts

00:50:08.339 --> 00:50:09.440 align:middle line:90%
of a simpler time?

00:50:09.440 --> 00:50:10.141 align:middle line:90%
>>RP: Yeah.

00:50:10.141 --> 00:50:11.209 align:middle line:90%
>>RM: That makes sense.

00:50:11.209 --> 00:50:12.844 align:middle line:84%
>>RP: I also think
too that we're living

00:50:12.844 --> 00:50:14.378 align:middle line:90%
in a really fascinating time.

00:50:14.378 --> 00:50:16.914 align:middle line:84%
Where timelines, even
though I've talked

00:50:16.914 --> 00:50:20.118 align:middle line:84%
about how we morph off
into another timeline.

00:50:20.118 --> 00:50:21.486 align:middle line:90%
>>RM: Yes.

00:50:21.486 --> 00:50:24.589 align:middle line:84%
>>RP: And, by the way 9/11 is
a very, very important event

00:50:24.589 --> 00:50:28.593 align:middle line:84%
as part of that timeline,
because 9/11 is a Gemini event,

00:50:28.593 --> 00:50:31.462 align:middle line:84%
right, the Twin Towers,
and it's the collapse.

00:50:31.462 --> 00:50:35.399 align:middle line:84%
It's a meta-ritual and the
collapse of the Twin Towers,

00:50:35.399 --> 00:50:39.937 align:middle line:84%
and the formation of the
One World Trade Center,

00:50:39.937 --> 00:50:42.974 align:middle line:84%
the one world tower was going
to be the Freedom Tower, right?

00:50:42.974 --> 00:50:44.909 align:middle line:84%
But, now it's the
One World Tower.

00:50:44.909 --> 00:50:49.514 align:middle line:84%
The 9/11 event is very,
very important, because #1,

00:50:49.514 --> 00:50:51.048 align:middle line:90%
the 11, the Twin Towers.

00:50:51.048 --> 00:50:57.155 align:middle line:84%
#2, George Bush is president at
that time, and his father was

00:50:57.155 --> 00:51:02.326 align:middle line:84%
in Dealey Plaza when Kennedy was
assassinated, so we have lineage

00:51:02.326 --> 00:51:04.495 align:middle line:90%
through time with Bush.

00:51:04.495 --> 00:51:08.566 align:middle line:84%
What's also really interesting
is that Larry Silverstein,

00:51:08.566 --> 00:51:12.603 align:middle line:84%
who bought the World
Trade Center just months.

00:51:12.603 --> 00:51:13.738 align:middle line:90%
>>RM: Right.

00:51:13.738 --> 00:51:18.376 align:middle line:84%
>>RP: Before the tragedy
of 9/11, he's a Gemini.

00:51:18.376 --> 00:51:22.813 align:middle line:84%
He was born on May 30, and so
now we have Gemini coming back

00:51:22.813 --> 00:51:25.616 align:middle line:84%
into the picture
again, and guess what?

00:51:25.616 --> 00:51:30.087 align:middle line:84%
You know, we get to,
theoretically, we being they,

00:51:30.087 --> 00:51:32.156 align:middle line:84%
we get to determine
the timeline again.

00:51:32.156 --> 00:51:34.959 align:middle line:84%
We get to have another
event where we fork off.

00:51:34.959 --> 00:51:39.230 align:middle line:84%
It's the millennia, and this is
the start of the New Dark Age.

00:51:39.230 --> 00:51:43.234 align:middle line:84%
This is it, and everything
that's happened as a result

00:51:43.234 --> 00:51:48.673 align:middle line:84%
of that has been an iteration
of that consecration.

00:51:48.673 --> 00:51:50.708 align:middle line:84%
>>RM: And so, how's
that expressing itself

00:51:50.708 --> 00:51:53.578 align:middle line:84%
in the adult lives
of these Librans.

00:51:53.578 --> 00:51:56.781 align:middle line:84%
>>RP: Well, the Pluto
and Libra people,

00:51:56.781 --> 00:52:00.718 align:middle line:84%
I'm not sure how it's
expressing in terms

00:52:00.718 --> 00:52:06.190 align:middle line:84%
of political rage
or, I don't know.

00:52:06.190 --> 00:52:08.492 align:middle line:84%
I really, I can't get
a feel around that.

00:52:08.492 --> 00:52:12.730 align:middle line:84%
But what I do know is
that if we could consider

00:52:12.730 --> 00:52:15.233 align:middle line:84%
that we've had this
divergent timeline.

00:52:15.233 --> 00:52:16.467 align:middle line:90%
>>RM: Right.

00:52:16.467 --> 00:52:18.402 align:middle line:84%
>>RP: That other things
could theoretically happen;

00:52:18.402 --> 00:52:22.406 align:middle line:84%
that we may have actually
have multiple or sub-timelines

00:52:22.406 --> 00:52:24.809 align:middle line:84%
that are happening
simultaneously.

00:52:24.809 --> 00:52:26.210 align:middle line:90%
>>RM: It seems like it.

00:52:26.210 --> 00:52:28.479 align:middle line:84%
>>RP: It seems we can actually
talk a little bit about this.

00:52:28.479 --> 00:52:31.582 align:middle line:84%
So, when you look at the
Pluto and Libra Generations

00:52:31.582 --> 00:52:34.051 align:middle line:84%
who are buying the aprons and
the cupcakes and all that stuff.

00:52:34.051 --> 00:52:36.754 align:middle line:84%
And, you're absolutely
right, it's a desire

00:52:36.754 --> 00:52:37.722 align:middle line:90%
and a need for comfort.

00:52:37.722 --> 00:52:38.923 align:middle line:90%
>>RM: In the media it's huge.

00:52:38.923 --> 00:52:40.258 align:middle line:90%
>>RP: It is huge.

00:52:40.258 --> 00:52:44.562 align:middle line:84%
That is one kind of rivulet
or sub-stream of a timeline.

00:52:44.562 --> 00:52:47.999 align:middle line:84%
You and I earlier, we were
talking about baseball,

00:52:47.999 --> 00:52:51.435 align:middle line:84%
and I was watching the
Boston Red Sox the other day,

00:52:51.435 --> 00:52:54.672 align:middle line:84%
and all the guys on the Red Sox
have these really long beards.

00:52:54.672 --> 00:52:56.073 align:middle line:84%
>>RM: Yeah, I thought,
what's up with that?

00:52:56.073 --> 00:53:00.011 align:middle line:84%
>>RP: Well, and it was like, the
last time I remember anything

00:53:00.011 --> 00:53:03.648 align:middle line:84%
like that, and there are other
players in the major leagues now

00:53:03.648 --> 00:53:05.082 align:middle line:84%
that are growing
these beards too.

00:53:05.082 --> 00:53:09.086 align:middle line:84%
If you go back in time, you
go to the turn of the century,

00:53:09.086 --> 00:53:11.255 align:middle line:84%
like the 1900's,
baseball is being played,

00:53:11.255 --> 00:53:14.191 align:middle line:84%
and a lot of those players
had really long beards.

00:53:14.191 --> 00:53:16.227 align:middle line:84%
And a lot of them are
actually also looking

00:53:16.227 --> 00:53:18.362 align:middle line:84%
like characters from
the Civil War.

00:53:18.362 --> 00:53:19.530 align:middle line:84%
>>RM: Yeah, so it's
kind of going back

00:53:19.530 --> 00:53:22.400 align:middle line:84%
to a more authentic
simpler time again.

00:53:22.400 --> 00:53:24.735 align:middle line:84%
>>RP: Again, they're trying
to reconnect with something.

00:53:24.735 --> 00:53:27.071 align:middle line:84%
They're trying, you know,
and what's fascinating

00:53:27.071 --> 00:53:29.507 align:middle line:84%
about the beard is that the
beard has psychic tendrils

00:53:29.507 --> 00:53:30.074 align:middle line:90%
as well.

00:53:30.074 --> 00:53:30.908 align:middle line:90%
>>RM: Yes.

00:53:30.908 --> 00:53:32.143 align:middle line:90%
>>RP: So, their actually turning

00:53:32.143 --> 00:53:34.912 align:middle line:84%
into their own group
consciousness while they play

00:53:34.912 --> 00:53:36.714 align:middle line:90%
with the growth of these beards.

00:53:36.714 --> 00:53:39.550 align:middle line:84%
So, I think that there's
something interesting happening.

00:53:39.550 --> 00:53:43.220 align:middle line:84%
You know, there's also, in
like the festival circuit,

00:53:43.220 --> 00:53:45.623 align:middle line:84%
one of the fashions
that's related

00:53:45.623 --> 00:53:48.025 align:middle line:84%
to the festival circuit
is like steam punk,

00:53:48.025 --> 00:53:51.362 align:middle line:84%
and steam punk is this
whole turn of the century,

00:53:51.362 --> 00:53:56.400 align:middle line:84%
kind of Dickensian sort
of industrial kind of look

00:53:56.400 --> 00:53:59.937 align:middle line:84%
and feel, with brass
and chrome and leather,

00:53:59.937 --> 00:54:03.674 align:middle line:84%
but has a slightly
futuristic tilt to it.

00:54:03.674 --> 00:54:06.377 align:middle line:84%
So, there are a lot of
things happening sort

00:54:06.377 --> 00:54:09.046 align:middle line:90%
of simultaneously right now,

00:54:09.046 --> 00:54:11.315 align:middle line:84%
but there are certainly
some predominant themes,

00:54:11.315 --> 00:54:14.652 align:middle line:84%
and one of the predominant
themes we're looking at is,

00:54:14.652 --> 00:54:16.754 align:middle line:84%
you know, what happens
after 9/11.

00:54:16.754 --> 00:54:20.558 align:middle line:90%
How is that timeline maintained?

00:54:20.558 --> 00:54:25.196 align:middle line:84%
How do people continue
to be put in this trance,

00:54:25.196 --> 00:54:26.731 align:middle line:90%
where they can step out of it

00:54:26.731 --> 00:54:28.366 align:middle line:84%
and maybe create
something different?

00:54:28.366 --> 00:54:29.433 align:middle line:90%
>>RM: Yes.

00:54:29.433 --> 00:54:30.368 align:middle line:84%
>>RP: So, that we have
these mini events,

00:54:30.368 --> 00:54:33.871 align:middle line:84%
these mini 9/11's,
like Aurora or.

00:54:33.871 --> 00:54:35.506 align:middle line:84%
>>RM: Trying to reinforce
the trance.

00:54:35.506 --> 00:54:39.210 align:middle line:84%
>>RP: Absolutely, or we have
Sandy Hook, things like that,

00:54:39.210 --> 00:54:41.946 align:middle line:84%
and perhaps to some
extent, what's happening

00:54:41.946 --> 00:54:44.181 align:middle line:84%
with Zimmerman and
Travon Martin.

00:54:44.181 --> 00:54:46.617 align:middle line:90%
So, this is also taking place.

00:54:46.617 --> 00:54:49.420 align:middle line:84%
But, I think what's
also taking place is

00:54:49.420 --> 00:54:52.390 align:middle line:84%
that people are waking up,
and they're beginning to see

00:54:52.390 --> 00:54:57.461 align:middle line:84%
that these events
are much more shaky

00:54:57.461 --> 00:54:58.996 align:middle line:90%
than they've ever been before.

00:54:58.996 --> 00:55:00.464 align:middle line:84%
They're starting look
behind the screen.

00:55:00.464 --> 00:55:04.001 align:middle line:84%
We're all kind of beginning to
have this kind of collective,

00:55:04.001 --> 00:55:05.503 align:middle line:90%
you know, Wizard of Oz moment.

00:55:05.503 --> 00:55:06.570 align:middle line:90%
>>RM: Yeah.

00:55:06.570 --> 00:55:09.173 align:middle line:84%
>>RP: What's really
behind this curtain?

00:55:09.173 --> 00:55:12.176 align:middle line:84%
And, I think it's actually
a quite empowering time.

00:55:12.176 --> 00:55:14.011 align:middle line:84%
>>RM: And, we only have a
few minutes left, but please,

00:55:14.011 --> 00:55:16.547 align:middle line:84%
let's do talk about Turkey
and Egypt during this time,

00:55:16.547 --> 00:55:18.315 align:middle line:84%
because you see that
as a really hopeful

00:55:18.315 --> 00:55:20.484 align:middle line:84%
and very important
turning point.

00:55:20.484 --> 00:55:23.554 align:middle line:84%
>>RP: This is true, because
in a time where we seem

00:55:23.554 --> 00:55:26.390 align:middle line:84%
to have perpetual revolution,
perpetual chaos based

00:55:26.390 --> 00:55:31.595 align:middle line:84%
on perpetual revolution, the
two incidence where I think

00:55:31.595 --> 00:55:33.297 align:middle line:90%
that this is really powerful

00:55:33.297 --> 00:55:36.200 align:middle line:84%
and transformational is
what's taken place recently

00:55:36.200 --> 00:55:38.702 align:middle line:90%
in Turkey and in Egypt.

00:55:38.702 --> 00:55:46.210 align:middle line:84%
We'll start with Turkey, you
know, there was a major push

00:55:46.210 --> 00:55:50.314 align:middle line:90%
in Syria by Obama, by NATO.

00:55:50.314 --> 00:55:51.582 align:middle line:90%
I mean, they were ramping up.

00:55:51.582 --> 00:55:54.518 align:middle line:90%
The press was all over it.

00:55:54.518 --> 00:55:56.620 align:middle line:90%
McCain was in Syria.

00:55:56.620 --> 00:55:58.522 align:middle line:84%
Carey was traveling
to the Middle East.

00:55:58.522 --> 00:56:00.524 align:middle line:90%
Hague was in the Middle East.

00:56:00.524 --> 00:56:02.860 align:middle line:90%
They were all moving.

00:56:02.860 --> 00:56:04.061 align:middle line:90%
They're all moving.

00:56:04.061 --> 00:56:06.330 align:middle line:84%
They're, you know, putting
the kill show to Syria.

00:56:06.330 --> 00:56:11.502 align:middle line:84%
They decided they're going to
have a no fly zone over Syria.

00:56:11.502 --> 00:56:12.703 align:middle line:90%
>>RM: Right.

00:56:12.703 --> 00:56:13.804 align:middle line:84%
>>RP: They've decided that
they're going to be able

00:56:13.804 --> 00:56:15.639 align:middle line:84%
to sell weapons now
to the rebels, right?

00:56:15.639 --> 00:56:19.176 align:middle line:84%
I mean, this is all, they're
really pulling back the curtain,

00:56:19.176 --> 00:56:21.479 align:middle line:84%
saying, look, this is
aggressive, we're behind this.

00:56:21.479 --> 00:56:23.047 align:middle line:90%
We're going to make this happen.

00:56:23.047 --> 00:56:27.651 align:middle line:84%
And then, just out of the
blue, right, out of the blue,

00:56:27.651 --> 00:56:31.622 align:middle line:84%
Turkey has this massive,
and I mean, massive protest,

00:56:31.622 --> 00:56:35.759 align:middle line:84%
and it's all started, and it's
based around one little park.

00:56:35.759 --> 00:56:37.428 align:middle line:84%
One little park in
the heart of Istanbul.

00:56:37.428 --> 00:56:39.663 align:middle line:84%
The last park that
they have in Istanbul.

00:56:39.663 --> 00:56:42.166 align:middle line:84%
People go out there, they're
going to tear the park down.

00:56:42.166 --> 00:56:43.501 align:middle line:84%
They're going to
put up a Starbuck's

00:56:43.501 --> 00:56:47.538 align:middle line:84%
or whatever they're going to
do, and people decided, hey,

00:56:47.538 --> 00:56:48.506 align:middle line:90%
we're going to camp out.

00:56:48.506 --> 00:56:50.407 align:middle line:84%
We're going to spend
some time here.

00:56:50.407 --> 00:56:52.910 align:middle line:84%
In fact, we're not leaving,
because we want this part.

00:56:52.910 --> 00:56:55.980 align:middle line:84%
Well, that little, that
quiet little protest turned

00:56:55.980 --> 00:56:58.215 align:middle line:90%
into something momentous.

00:56:58.215 --> 00:57:01.519 align:middle line:90%
It shut the entire country down.

00:57:01.519 --> 00:57:04.288 align:middle line:84%
Absolutely shut the
entire country down,

00:57:04.288 --> 00:57:07.258 align:middle line:84%
and what's fascinating
about that is that the kids

00:57:07.258 --> 00:57:09.093 align:middle line:84%
who were involved
in that protest,

00:57:09.093 --> 00:57:10.895 align:middle line:84%
a lot of them were
Pluto and Scorpio kids,

00:57:10.895 --> 00:57:12.429 align:middle line:84%
which we're going
to talk about later.

00:57:12.429 --> 00:57:13.664 align:middle line:90%
>>RM: Yes.

00:57:13.664 --> 00:57:15.599 align:middle line:84%
>>RP: But, their mom's
were there to support them.

00:57:15.599 --> 00:57:18.802 align:middle line:84%
Their mom's were out there
saying, we believe in you.

00:57:18.802 --> 00:57:19.970 align:middle line:90%
You're doing a good thing.

00:57:19.970 --> 00:57:21.405 align:middle line:84%
You're taking care
of your country.

00:57:21.405 --> 00:57:25.776 align:middle line:84%
There's a very, fairly
well-known cartoon

00:57:25.776 --> 00:57:26.610 align:middle line:90%
where there's this kid.

00:57:26.610 --> 00:57:27.645 align:middle line:90%
He's got his mask on.

00:57:27.645 --> 00:57:28.679 align:middle line:90%
He's pierced.

00:57:28.679 --> 00:57:30.481 align:middle line:84%
He's got an A with
a circle around it,

00:57:30.481 --> 00:57:33.217 align:middle line:84%
and his mom is there
giving him lunch.

00:57:33.217 --> 00:57:34.184 align:middle line:90%
>>RM: Yes.

00:57:34.184 --> 00:57:34.852 align:middle line:84%
>>RP: Have you seen
that cartoon?

00:57:34.852 --> 00:57:35.553 align:middle line:90%
>>RM: No, I haven't.

00:57:35.553 --> 00:57:36.654 align:middle line:90%
>>RP: It's fascinating.

00:57:36.654 --> 00:57:41.525 align:middle line:84%
So, but I think what
happens in Turkey is

00:57:41.525 --> 00:57:43.727 align:middle line:90%
that they put the kibosh

00:57:43.727 --> 00:57:47.565 align:middle line:84%
on something potentially
disastrous in Syria.

00:57:47.565 --> 00:57:50.601 align:middle line:84%
I really feel like World
War III was averted.

00:57:50.601 --> 00:57:51.802 align:middle line:90%
>>RM: That's fabulous to hear.

00:57:51.802 --> 00:57:54.638 align:middle line:84%
>>RP: Through these
series of massive protests,

00:57:54.638 --> 00:57:58.275 align:middle line:84%
because Erdogan, at that point
in time could not be engaged,

00:57:58.275 --> 00:58:01.145 align:middle line:84%
fully engaged in an
operation with Syria.

00:58:01.145 --> 00:58:03.714 align:middle line:84%
He had to focus his
police force,

00:58:03.714 --> 00:58:07.117 align:middle line:84%
he had to focus his
troops on containing

00:58:07.117 --> 00:58:10.120 align:middle line:84%
and saving his presidency
in Turkey.

00:58:10.120 --> 00:58:16.360 align:middle line:84%
And, Egypt, Egypt is
actually pretty amazing.

00:58:16.360 --> 00:58:19.296 align:middle line:90%
Egypt has a fascinating history

00:58:19.296 --> 00:58:22.800 align:middle line:84%
where every time they've
had a change of government

00:58:22.800 --> 00:58:26.437 align:middle line:84%
or they've had some sort of
constitutional amendment,

00:58:26.437 --> 00:58:29.607 align:middle line:84%
it's all taken place
with Saturn and Libra,

00:58:29.607 --> 00:58:33.777 align:middle line:84%
and the last time this took
place was when Morsi was put

00:58:33.777 --> 00:58:37.514 align:middle line:84%
into power after
their last revolution.

00:58:37.514 --> 00:58:41.485 align:middle line:84%
Well, this revolution took
place with Saturn and Scorpio,

00:58:41.485 --> 00:58:42.953 align:middle line:90%
and it was like, this is it.

00:58:42.953 --> 00:58:45.689 align:middle line:84%
>>RM: So, this is going to
take, meaning some organic,

00:58:45.689 --> 00:58:47.524 align:middle line:90%
even if it fomented and inspired

00:58:47.524 --> 00:58:49.893 align:middle line:84%
by maybe some intelligence
here and there.

00:58:49.893 --> 00:58:50.894 align:middle line:90%
>>RP: Right.

00:58:50.894 --> 00:58:51.929 align:middle line:84%
>>RM: The point is
it became organic,

00:58:51.929 --> 00:58:53.364 align:middle line:84%
and they have stood
up for themselves.

00:58:53.364 --> 00:58:56.767 align:middle line:84%
>>RP: Exactly, and Scorpio is
a fixed sign, so this is a way

00:58:56.767 --> 00:58:58.469 align:middle line:84%
for them to fix their
experience.

00:58:58.469 --> 00:58:59.970 align:middle line:84%
>>RM: Well, we've got a
lot more to talk about.

00:58:59.970 --> 00:59:01.705 align:middle line:84%
We have a whole other
very quirky,

00:59:01.705 --> 00:59:04.408 align:middle line:84%
interesting generation
we're going to talk

00:59:04.408 --> 00:59:05.909 align:middle line:90%
about in another conversation.

00:59:05.909 --> 00:59:08.112 align:middle line:84%
So, I want to thank you
so much for your time.

00:59:08.112 --> 00:59:09.413 align:middle line:90%
>>RP: It was my pleasure.

00:59:09.413 --> 00:59:11.782 align:middle line:84%
>>RM: In our next conversation,
Robert and I will speak

00:59:11.782 --> 00:59:15.919 align:middle line:84%
of Generation XXX of Y, who is
fast coming to be of influence

00:59:15.919 --> 00:59:17.921 align:middle line:84%
in society, and they
are not buying it.

00:59:17.921 --> 00:59:21.291 align:middle line:84%
Until next time, thank you for
joining us here on Gaiam TV.
