00:00:04.964 --> 00:00:06.380 align:middle line:10%
>>REGINA MEREDITH:
Many of us have

00:00:06.380 --> 00:00:08.450 align:middle line:10%
raised children who we
felt were challenging,

00:00:08.450 --> 00:00:11.470 align:middle line:10%
but what if you had the
additional challenge of a child

00:00:11.470 --> 00:00:13.450 align:middle line:10%
who had full
awareness from birth?

00:00:13.450 --> 00:00:15.580 align:middle line:84%
And what if that
child was experiencing

00:00:15.580 --> 00:00:17.540 align:middle line:90%
constant alien contact?

00:00:17.540 --> 00:00:20.870 align:middle line:84%
Ann Andrews will tell us a
story about her son, Jason,

00:00:20.870 --> 00:00:23.312 align:middle line:90%
who was a chosen one.

00:00:23.312 --> 00:00:26.680 align:middle line:90%
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:00:26.680 --> 00:00:46.191 align:middle line:90%


00:00:46.191 --> 00:00:46.690 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:00:46.690 --> 00:00:49.300 align:middle line:84%
Some things started changing
with the birth of your son

00:00:49.300 --> 00:00:49.980 align:middle line:90%
Jason.

00:00:49.980 --> 00:00:52.590 align:middle line:84%
Can you start
telling us the story?

00:00:52.590 --> 00:00:54.000 align:middle line:90%
>>ANN ANDREWS: Yes.

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:58.390 align:middle line:10%
As I say, Daniel's birth, the
older brother, was very normal.

00:00:58.390 --> 00:00:59.950 align:middle line:10%
No problems.

00:00:59.950 --> 00:01:04.640 align:middle line:10%
With Jason, I had to
take a lot of bed rest.

00:01:04.640 --> 00:01:07.587 align:middle line:10%
Then it became apparent
when obviously he

00:01:07.587 --> 00:01:09.170 align:middle line:10%
was imminent that
there were problems.

00:01:09.170 --> 00:01:11.800 align:middle line:90%


00:01:11.800 --> 00:01:18.270 align:middle line:84%
They brought in a fetal monitor
to measure the heartbeat.

00:01:18.270 --> 00:01:21.380 align:middle line:84%
That suddenly sort
of just went dead.

00:01:21.380 --> 00:01:23.300 align:middle line:90%
There was no heartbeat at all.

00:01:23.300 --> 00:01:27.250 align:middle line:84%
And of course, the place
was absolute confusion.

00:01:27.250 --> 00:01:29.660 align:middle line:84%
Obviously, I was a
bit sort of out of it

00:01:29.660 --> 00:01:31.530 align:middle line:84%
too much at the time,
so I didn't really

00:01:31.530 --> 00:01:34.110 align:middle line:90%
sort of react to it.

00:01:34.110 --> 00:01:37.400 align:middle line:84%
And then, well, I'll
say the next thing,

00:01:37.400 --> 00:01:39.760 align:middle line:84%
Jason was delivered
happy, healthy.

00:01:39.760 --> 00:01:42.160 align:middle line:84%
They actually had an
incubator ready for him,

00:01:42.160 --> 00:01:43.892 align:middle line:90%
but he didn't need it.

00:01:43.892 --> 00:01:45.850 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: How long had
his heart-- for how long

00:01:45.850 --> 00:01:47.141 align:middle line:90%
had the heart not been beating?

00:01:47.141 --> 00:01:50.350 align:middle line:84%
>>ANN: Well, they said
it was for a few minutes.

00:01:50.350 --> 00:01:53.830 align:middle line:84%
But then, of course, as I say,
once he was delivered safely

00:01:53.830 --> 00:01:56.680 align:middle line:84%
and very healthy, they
assumed that there

00:01:56.680 --> 00:01:58.230 align:middle line:84%
was something wrong
with the machine.

00:01:58.230 --> 00:02:00.890 align:middle line:84%
So the next thing I
was aware of was, like,

00:02:00.890 --> 00:02:03.470 align:middle line:84%
being handed the baby and
then the technicians sort

00:02:03.470 --> 00:02:07.060 align:middle line:84%
of taking the machine off
and bringing in another one.

00:02:07.060 --> 00:02:09.047 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: It was an
odd thing, but you

00:02:09.047 --> 00:02:11.130 align:middle line:84%
thought, well, he's here,
he's pink, he's healthy.

00:02:11.130 --> 00:02:13.700 align:middle line:84%
And no more thought was really
given to it at that time,

00:02:13.700 --> 00:02:15.730 align:middle line:84%
although your
baby's heart is not

00:02:15.730 --> 00:02:17.490 align:middle line:84%
supposed to stop
for a few minutes.

00:02:17.490 --> 00:02:20.380 align:middle line:84%
>>ANN: Well, this
is what we said.

00:02:20.380 --> 00:02:23.710 align:middle line:84%
But obviously, the staff said,
well, no, obviously, he's

00:02:23.710 --> 00:02:24.630 align:middle line:90%
healthy, he's happy.

00:02:24.630 --> 00:02:27.670 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Let's not look
at it, yeah, for now.

00:02:27.670 --> 00:02:28.380 align:middle line:84%
>>ANN: They'd considered
it to be the machine.

00:02:28.380 --> 00:02:29.670 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Let
bygones be bygones.

00:02:29.670 --> 00:02:29.740 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

00:02:29.740 --> 00:02:30.650 align:middle line:90%
>>ANN: Yes.

00:02:30.650 --> 00:02:32.858 align:middle line:84%
They thought it was something
wrong with the machine.

00:02:32.858 --> 00:02:34.907 align:middle line:90%
So hence why they took it away.

00:02:34.907 --> 00:02:36.490 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Now we can
go ahead and talk

00:02:36.490 --> 00:02:41.330 align:middle line:84%
about Daniel, his older
brother's friend-- the way

00:02:41.330 --> 00:02:44.180 align:middle line:84%
he was interfacing with it,
the nature of his friend, why

00:02:44.180 --> 00:02:46.000 align:middle line:84%
you thought it was
rather odd choice

00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:47.600 align:middle line:90%
for an invisible playmate.

00:02:47.600 --> 00:02:49.930 align:middle line:90%
And talk about that for a bit.

00:02:49.930 --> 00:02:50.670 align:middle line:90%
>>ANN: Yes.

00:02:50.670 --> 00:02:54.020 align:middle line:84%
As I say, we weren't worried,
because most single children

00:02:54.020 --> 00:02:55.430 align:middle line:90%
do have invisible friends.

00:02:55.430 --> 00:02:57.810 align:middle line:84%
But Daniel's choice we
thought was very odd,

00:02:57.810 --> 00:03:03.090 align:middle line:84%
because he said that his
friend was a spaceman

00:03:03.090 --> 00:03:04.840 align:middle line:90%
and that he came from the stars.

00:03:04.840 --> 00:03:09.460 align:middle line:84%
I mean, he actually had a really
good knowledge of the star

00:03:09.460 --> 00:03:11.846 align:middle line:84%
systems, I mean,
bearing in mind he's

00:03:11.846 --> 00:03:12.970 align:middle line:90%
four years old at the time.

00:03:12.970 --> 00:03:14.260 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And he had
knowledge of star systems?

00:03:14.260 --> 00:03:16.093 align:middle line:84%
>>ANN: And he had
knowledge of star systems.

00:03:16.093 --> 00:03:18.515 align:middle line:84%
I mean, he would take Paul
and myself out at night,

00:03:18.515 --> 00:03:20.840 align:middle line:84%
and he'd say, see that star,
mum, that's called this.

00:03:20.840 --> 00:03:22.330 align:middle line:90%
And that's from that system.

00:03:22.330 --> 00:03:26.850 align:middle line:84%
And we were like, where's
he getting this from?

00:03:26.850 --> 00:03:29.630 align:middle line:84%
And we just assumed
that maybe it

00:03:29.630 --> 00:03:33.060 align:middle line:84%
was educational TV or something,
because he just started school.

00:03:33.060 --> 00:03:37.380 align:middle line:84%
And so again, we
just thought, OK,

00:03:37.380 --> 00:03:39.140 align:middle line:84%
that's what it is,
that's what it is.

00:03:39.140 --> 00:03:41.720 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And what was
the name of his friend?

00:03:41.720 --> 00:03:43.382 align:middle line:90%
>>ANN: He called him Joonas.

00:03:43.382 --> 00:03:44.800 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:03:44.800 --> 00:03:46.740 align:middle line:84%
And Joonas gave him
various messages

00:03:46.740 --> 00:03:49.080 align:middle line:84%
as time went on, aside
from teaching him

00:03:49.080 --> 00:03:51.390 align:middle line:84%
about star systems they
came from and so forth.

00:03:51.390 --> 00:03:54.090 align:middle line:84%
And a little later, we're
going to kind of distinguish

00:03:54.090 --> 00:03:56.940 align:middle line:84%
between the types of beings that
were showing up in your family

00:03:56.940 --> 00:04:00.440 align:middle line:84%
profile and then go back into
your own personal history.

00:04:00.440 --> 00:04:04.280 align:middle line:84%
So Jason, one
thing I remember is

00:04:04.280 --> 00:04:06.770 align:middle line:84%
that he-- when he
cried in his room

00:04:06.770 --> 00:04:08.580 align:middle line:84%
and you would go
in there, this is

00:04:08.580 --> 00:04:13.070 align:middle line:84%
when some really odd occurrences
had started beginning.

00:04:13.070 --> 00:04:15.060 align:middle line:84%
So tell us the
array of things that

00:04:15.060 --> 00:04:17.390 align:middle line:84%
were happening when
you'd go into his room.

00:04:17.390 --> 00:04:20.620 align:middle line:84%
>>ANN: Well, as you so rightly
said, we'd hear him crying.

00:04:20.620 --> 00:04:24.640 align:middle line:84%
We'd go in the room, because
he had his own nursery room.

00:04:24.640 --> 00:04:26.820 align:middle line:84%
And we would find that
he wasn't in his cot.

00:04:26.820 --> 00:04:28.390 align:middle line:84%
Sometimes he would
be underneath it.

00:04:28.390 --> 00:04:29.480 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: A cot is a crib in--

00:04:29.480 --> 00:04:29.920 align:middle line:90%
>>ANN: Oh, sorry.

00:04:29.920 --> 00:04:30.220 align:middle line:90%
A crib, yes.

00:04:30.220 --> 00:04:30.730 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: No, that's fine.

00:04:30.730 --> 00:04:32.270 align:middle line:84%
You call them cots;
we call them cribs.

00:04:32.270 --> 00:04:34.890 align:middle line:84%
Just to let our American viewers
know what you're speaking of.

00:04:34.890 --> 00:04:35.590 align:middle line:90%
>>ANN: OK.

00:04:35.590 --> 00:04:36.870 align:middle line:90%
Right, yes.

00:04:36.870 --> 00:04:38.420 align:middle line:90%
Yes, he wouldn't be in there.

00:04:38.420 --> 00:04:41.760 align:middle line:84%
He'd be underneath it, or
he'd be underneath a chair.

00:04:41.760 --> 00:04:45.690 align:middle line:84%
Sometimes we actually found him
in the bottom of the wardrobe.

00:04:45.690 --> 00:04:48.690 align:middle line:84%
And I mean, you're talking about
a baby that's a few weeks old.

00:04:48.690 --> 00:04:51.580 align:middle line:90%
I mean, how-- how?

00:04:51.580 --> 00:04:52.700 align:middle line:90%
It doesn't make sense.

00:04:52.700 --> 00:04:55.140 align:middle line:84%
So obviously,
being very logical,

00:04:55.140 --> 00:04:59.420 align:middle line:84%
practical people, we said, well,
it must be his older brother

00:04:59.420 --> 00:05:01.420 align:middle line:84%
even though he'd been
told not to touch the baby

00:05:01.420 --> 00:05:03.620 align:middle line:90%
when mom wasn't there.

00:05:03.620 --> 00:05:05.820 align:middle line:84%
So we figured, well,
if he stands on a chair

00:05:05.820 --> 00:05:08.140 align:middle line:84%
and he stands on
tiptoes, then maybe he

00:05:08.140 --> 00:05:09.790 align:middle line:90%
can just about reach him.

00:05:09.790 --> 00:05:11.480 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: But still,
that's a stretch.

00:05:11.480 --> 00:05:15.040 align:middle line:84%
And then pull him out, be able
to bear the weight and all.

00:05:15.040 --> 00:05:16.220 align:middle line:90%
>>ANN: Exactly.

00:05:16.220 --> 00:05:16.770 align:middle line:90%
Exactly.

00:05:16.770 --> 00:05:19.757 align:middle line:84%
But then again, your rational
mind doesn't sort of--

00:05:19.757 --> 00:05:21.090 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: [LAUGHS] Probably not.

00:05:21.090 --> 00:05:22.450 align:middle line:90%
>>ANN: You don't think that way.

00:05:22.450 --> 00:05:24.410 align:middle line:84%
You just think, oh,
well, it's got to be him.

00:05:24.410 --> 00:05:26.600 align:middle line:84%
We'll mention it to
the health worker

00:05:26.600 --> 00:05:29.170 align:middle line:90%
when she comes, which we did.

00:05:29.170 --> 00:05:32.180 align:middle line:84%
And she just said, well,
don't worry about it too much.

00:05:32.180 --> 00:05:33.970 align:middle line:90%
Don't confront him with it.

00:05:33.970 --> 00:05:38.300 align:middle line:84%
And he'll get bored
soon, and it'll stop.

00:05:38.300 --> 00:05:39.960 align:middle line:84%
But I mean, that
used to happen when

00:05:39.960 --> 00:05:41.663 align:middle line:90%
he wasn't even in the house.

00:05:41.663 --> 00:05:42.162 align:middle line:90%
So.

00:05:42.162 --> 00:05:43.392 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHTER]

00:05:43.392 --> 00:05:45.100 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: OK, well,
when it was happening

00:05:45.100 --> 00:05:47.870 align:middle line:84%
when he wasn't in the house, you
know how when something is just

00:05:47.870 --> 00:05:50.920 align:middle line:84%
so shocking and awful,
you can't help but laugh?

00:05:50.920 --> 00:05:52.740 align:middle line:90%
I mean, it's not funny.

00:05:52.740 --> 00:05:54.940 align:middle line:84%
But still, you think
of a little baby

00:05:54.940 --> 00:05:58.667 align:middle line:84%
somehow floating out of his
crib to one place or another,

00:05:58.667 --> 00:06:00.875 align:middle line:84%
and you can't blame it on
the little brother anymore.

00:06:00.875 --> 00:06:01.740 align:middle line:90%
>>ANN: Exactly.

00:06:01.740 --> 00:06:03.310 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So what
were your thoughts

00:06:03.310 --> 00:06:05.570 align:middle line:84%
once you realized
this was happening

00:06:05.570 --> 00:06:07.750 align:middle line:90%
when Daniel wasn't around?

00:06:07.750 --> 00:06:09.690 align:middle line:84%
>>ANN: Truthfully,
I worried about it.

00:06:09.690 --> 00:06:11.540 align:middle line:90%
I worried about it an awful lot.

00:06:11.540 --> 00:06:13.360 align:middle line:90%
I tried to confide in Paul.

00:06:13.360 --> 00:06:13.980 align:middle line:84%
I tried to talk
to Paul about it.

00:06:13.980 --> 00:06:14.938 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Your husband?

00:06:14.938 --> 00:06:16.250 align:middle line:90%
>>ANN: My husband.

00:06:16.250 --> 00:06:18.800 align:middle line:84%
But obviously, with
working all day,

00:06:18.800 --> 00:06:21.890 align:middle line:84%
and, you know, he'd just say,
oh, you've made a mistake.

00:06:21.890 --> 00:06:25.910 align:middle line:84%
You're probably tired looking
after the baby and, obviously,

00:06:25.910 --> 00:06:27.530 align:middle line:90%
the older one.

00:06:27.530 --> 00:06:29.325 align:middle line:84%
And I knew I hadn't
made a mistake.

00:06:29.325 --> 00:06:31.260 align:middle line:90%
But it still kept happening.

00:06:31.260 --> 00:06:33.840 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: How was
this affecting Paul?

00:06:33.840 --> 00:06:35.985 align:middle line:84%
Did he think you were
going loopy or something?

00:06:35.985 --> 00:06:38.210 align:middle line:84%
>>ANN: He was a
little bit concerned.

00:06:38.210 --> 00:06:39.857 align:middle line:84%
He thought it might
be sort of-- I

00:06:39.857 --> 00:06:41.870 align:middle line:84%
don't know what they
call it-- postnatal

00:06:41.870 --> 00:06:44.680 align:middle line:90%
stress or something like that.

00:06:44.680 --> 00:06:47.530 align:middle line:84%
So there was a little
bit of worry there.

00:06:47.530 --> 00:06:50.207 align:middle line:84%
But you know when you
know something and--

00:06:50.207 --> 00:06:52.540 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Well, when you find
your baby out of the crib,

00:06:52.540 --> 00:06:54.664 align:middle line:84%
and his little brother's
not there to blame it on--

00:06:54.664 --> 00:06:55.200 align:middle line:90%
>>ANN: Yeah.

00:06:55.200 --> 00:06:56.060 align:middle line:90%
Exactly.

00:06:56.060 --> 00:06:57.260 align:middle line:90%
Exactly.

00:06:57.260 --> 00:06:59.460 align:middle line:90%
Where do you go from there?

00:06:59.460 --> 00:07:02.660 align:middle line:84%
So I didn't really have
anyone else to confide in.

00:07:02.660 --> 00:07:04.740 align:middle line:84%
But then, as I say,
after a few months,

00:07:04.740 --> 00:07:06.240 align:middle line:90%
the whole thing stopped.

00:07:06.240 --> 00:07:10.150 align:middle line:84%
He was just left alone,
and it didn't happen again.

00:07:10.150 --> 00:07:13.460 align:middle line:84%
So we just assumed it
must have been Daniel,

00:07:13.460 --> 00:07:15.557 align:middle line:90%
and maybe I'd made a mistake.

00:07:15.557 --> 00:07:16.140 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Hmm.

00:07:16.140 --> 00:07:17.390 align:middle line:90%
So it made you doubt yourself.

00:07:17.390 --> 00:07:20.660 align:middle line:84%
So it created a little
split on a cognitive level

00:07:20.660 --> 00:07:23.540 align:middle line:84%
with you, where you started
doubting yourself actually.

00:07:23.540 --> 00:07:26.760 align:middle line:84%
And what I find interesting
about this story

00:07:26.760 --> 00:07:32.080 align:middle line:84%
is that you're probably
not the only parent that

00:07:32.080 --> 00:07:34.480 align:middle line:84%
went through very similar
sets of reactions,

00:07:34.480 --> 00:07:38.730 align:middle line:84%
because there was no framework
to put it anywhere else.

00:07:38.730 --> 00:07:39.685 align:middle line:90%
So you doubt yourself.

00:07:39.685 --> 00:07:42.310 align:middle line:84%
You think, OK, they didn't have
a heartbeat for a little while,

00:07:42.310 --> 00:07:44.268 align:middle line:84%
but they said, oh, it's
all right, he's OK now.

00:07:44.268 --> 00:07:47.090 align:middle line:84%
You don't really start stringing
things together right away,

00:07:47.090 --> 00:07:47.960 align:middle line:90%
I would suppose.

00:07:47.960 --> 00:07:48.460 align:middle line:90%
>>ANN: No.

00:07:48.460 --> 00:07:49.370 align:middle line:90%
No, you don't.

00:07:49.370 --> 00:07:52.019 align:middle line:84%
You're just over
the moon that you've

00:07:52.019 --> 00:07:53.060 align:middle line:90%
got two healthy children.

00:07:53.060 --> 00:07:57.260 align:middle line:84%
And OK, maybe I could
have made a mistake,

00:07:57.260 --> 00:08:02.530 align:middle line:84%
or maybe it was
postnatal stress.

00:08:02.530 --> 00:08:04.680 align:middle line:84%
You just sort of
gloss over it, really,

00:08:04.680 --> 00:08:07.910 align:middle line:84%
and think, well, we've
got to look ahead.

00:08:07.910 --> 00:08:09.144 align:middle line:90%
And that's what you do.

00:08:09.144 --> 00:08:10.810 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And so he
observed some beings

00:08:10.810 --> 00:08:13.920 align:middle line:84%
in his room that kind
of floated in and out?

00:08:13.920 --> 00:08:15.700 align:middle line:90%
>>ANN: Yeah.

00:08:15.700 --> 00:08:17.720 align:middle line:90%
He said that they would come.

00:08:17.720 --> 00:08:20.560 align:middle line:84%
Sometimes they would come
up through the floor.

00:08:20.560 --> 00:08:22.370 align:middle line:84%
He said sometimes they
would sort of just

00:08:22.370 --> 00:08:23.890 align:middle line:84%
float, just pass
through the window.

00:08:23.890 --> 00:08:26.375 align:middle line:84%
He said they would just come
straight through the glass

00:08:26.375 --> 00:08:29.710 align:middle line:84%
or through the walls as
if they weren't there.

00:08:29.710 --> 00:08:33.795 align:middle line:84%
And they would then-- He
would always find himself-- I

00:08:33.795 --> 00:08:37.140 align:middle line:84%
mean, obviously, this is when he
was able to articulate things.

00:08:37.140 --> 00:08:39.799 align:middle line:84%
But he said he would always
find himself sort of unable

00:08:39.799 --> 00:08:41.221 align:middle line:90%
to move--

00:08:41.221 --> 00:08:42.429 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: The paralysis, yes.

00:08:42.429 --> 00:08:43.720 align:middle line:90%
>>ANN: --like he was paralyzed.

00:08:43.720 --> 00:08:45.635 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And how old
was he by this point?

00:08:45.635 --> 00:08:49.345 align:middle line:84%
>>ANN: Well, when he
started explaining it to us,

00:08:49.345 --> 00:08:53.000 align:middle line:90%
he was a little more than three.

00:08:53.000 --> 00:08:57.670 align:middle line:84%
And so his story never
changed, never ever changed.

00:08:57.670 --> 00:09:01.650 align:middle line:84%
He said all this until--
well, as I say, right up

00:09:01.650 --> 00:09:04.500 align:middle line:84%
till the point where we finally
did have to believe him.

00:09:04.500 --> 00:09:06.420 align:middle line:84%
But that wasn't till
he was 12 years old.

00:09:06.420 --> 00:09:07.086 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:09:07.086 --> 00:09:09.530 align:middle line:84%
And sometimes-- am I
understanding correctly?--

00:09:09.530 --> 00:09:11.796 align:middle line:84%
he would just sort of
phase out or disappear?

00:09:11.796 --> 00:09:15.345 align:middle line:90%
>>ANN: Yes, yes, he would.

00:09:15.345 --> 00:09:18.670 align:middle line:84%
He said the only thing that
he could move were his eyes.

00:09:18.670 --> 00:09:21.160 align:middle line:84%
He said he would often
sort of try and scream,

00:09:21.160 --> 00:09:24.030 align:middle line:90%
but no sound would come.

00:09:24.030 --> 00:09:27.270 align:middle line:84%
Then he said there was always
a taller being with them.

00:09:27.270 --> 00:09:29.390 align:middle line:84%
He said there were usually
lots of little ones,

00:09:29.390 --> 00:09:31.040 align:middle line:90%
and then there was a taller one.

00:09:31.040 --> 00:09:32.750 align:middle line:84%
And he said the
taller one would just

00:09:32.750 --> 00:09:34.450 align:middle line:90%
touch, like, with a finger.

00:09:34.450 --> 00:09:38.570 align:middle line:84%
And then he said he would
just rise from the bed

00:09:38.570 --> 00:09:39.519 align:middle line:90%
or wherever he was.

00:09:39.519 --> 00:09:40.310 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Levitate.

00:09:40.310 --> 00:09:41.510 align:middle line:90%
>>ANN: Yeah, levitate.

00:09:41.510 --> 00:09:45.320 align:middle line:84%
He suddenly would just slide him
straight out through the glass

00:09:45.320 --> 00:09:47.546 align:middle line:90%
the same way that they traveled.

00:09:47.546 --> 00:09:49.320 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: What color were they?

00:09:49.320 --> 00:09:51.115 align:middle line:90%
What color was the tall one?

00:09:51.115 --> 00:09:54.870 align:middle line:84%
>>ANN: He said that
they were all grey.

00:09:54.870 --> 00:09:58.430 align:middle line:84%
He maintained that the
smaller ones were sometimes

00:09:58.430 --> 00:10:00.100 align:middle line:90%
varying shades of gray.

00:10:00.100 --> 00:10:01.910 align:middle line:90%
But always grey.

00:10:01.910 --> 00:10:04.740 align:middle line:84%
He said that the taller one
was always lighter, lighter

00:10:04.740 --> 00:10:05.390 align:middle line:90%
in color.

00:10:05.390 --> 00:10:06.080 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:10:06.080 --> 00:10:09.400 align:middle line:84%
I think in the parlance
of that community,

00:10:09.400 --> 00:10:12.090 align:middle line:84%
they're the tall whites,
sometimes they call them.

00:10:12.090 --> 00:10:13.340 align:middle line:90%
>>ANN: Oh, I've heard of that.

00:10:13.340 --> 00:10:14.310 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: They're more pale.

00:10:14.310 --> 00:10:14.810 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:10:14.810 --> 00:10:16.840 align:middle line:84%
So it might be something
similar to that.

00:10:16.840 --> 00:10:17.840 align:middle line:90%
Mm.

00:10:17.840 --> 00:10:20.380 align:middle line:84%
And then about his
seventh birthday.

00:10:20.380 --> 00:10:22.930 align:middle line:90%
Then what started occurring?

00:10:22.930 --> 00:10:24.660 align:middle line:84%
>>ANN: That was his
fourth birthday.

00:10:24.660 --> 00:10:25.580 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: OK.

00:10:25.580 --> 00:10:26.380 align:middle line:90%
>>ANN: Sorry.

00:10:26.380 --> 00:10:27.220 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes, yes.

00:10:27.220 --> 00:10:27.950 align:middle line:90%
>>ANN: Yeah.

00:10:27.950 --> 00:10:30.230 align:middle line:84%
But it was his first
proper birthday party.

00:10:30.230 --> 00:10:31.080 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Oh, I see.

00:10:31.080 --> 00:10:31.580 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:10:31.580 --> 00:10:33.790 align:middle line:84%
>>ANN: So of course, you
can imagine we had children

00:10:33.790 --> 00:10:37.235 align:middle line:84%
everywhere and
jelly in the carpet,

00:10:37.235 --> 00:10:38.450 align:middle line:90%
the usual sort of thing.

00:10:38.450 --> 00:10:40.060 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah, sure.

00:10:40.060 --> 00:10:41.320 align:middle line:90%
>>ANN: Everybody enjoyed it.

00:10:41.320 --> 00:10:42.750 align:middle line:90%
Everybody loved it.

00:10:42.750 --> 00:10:47.330 align:middle line:84%
It was a day in
July, July the 2nd.

00:10:47.330 --> 00:10:50.520 align:middle line:84%
And then, obviously, after all
the children had gone home,

00:10:50.520 --> 00:10:55.230 align:middle line:84%
we could see that the skies were
gearing up for a thunderstorm.

00:10:55.230 --> 00:10:57.090 align:middle line:90%
But my mum was there to help us.

00:10:57.090 --> 00:11:00.490 align:middle line:84%
So she was sort of helping
us clear up and tidy.

00:11:00.490 --> 00:11:04.450 align:middle line:84%
And finally, we sort of got the
house looking fairly straight

00:11:04.450 --> 00:11:07.880 align:middle line:84%
again, sort of not
till late evening.

00:11:07.880 --> 00:11:10.640 align:middle line:84%
And that's when things
really kicked off,

00:11:10.640 --> 00:11:15.684 align:middle line:84%
because Jason had fallen asleep
on the settee, on the couch,

00:11:15.684 --> 00:11:16.350 align:middle line:90%
I think you say.

00:11:16.350 --> 00:11:18.490 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes, the couch.

00:11:18.490 --> 00:11:19.555 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

00:11:19.555 --> 00:11:22.250 align:middle line:84%
>>ANN: Daniel had
already gone to bed.

00:11:22.250 --> 00:11:24.980 align:middle line:84%
So of course, my mum just
put her coat over him

00:11:24.980 --> 00:11:25.980 align:middle line:90%
to keep him warm.

00:11:25.980 --> 00:11:29.000 align:middle line:84%
And the three of us were just
sitting there having coffee.

00:11:29.000 --> 00:11:30.710 align:middle line:84%
And there was a
knock at the door,

00:11:30.710 --> 00:11:34.295 align:middle line:84%
but it was really sort of hard
and heavy, like very insistent.

00:11:34.295 --> 00:11:35.660 align:middle line:90%
And of course, Paul got up.

00:11:35.660 --> 00:11:37.650 align:middle line:84%
And he said, well, god,
it's gone 10 o'clock.

00:11:37.650 --> 00:11:38.310 align:middle line:90%
Who on earth is that?

00:11:38.310 --> 00:11:39.050 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Who would be knocking?

00:11:39.050 --> 00:11:40.000 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:11:40.000 --> 00:11:41.750 align:middle line:84%
>>ANN: So he went
and opened the door.

00:11:41.750 --> 00:11:44.090 align:middle line:84%
And of course, it was
pouring down with rain.

00:11:44.090 --> 00:11:45.530 align:middle line:90%
And there's nobody there.

00:11:45.530 --> 00:11:49.350 align:middle line:84%
And the house that we lived
in, it was on its own.

00:11:49.350 --> 00:11:51.310 align:middle line:84%
So we sort of looked
up and down the lane.

00:11:51.310 --> 00:11:54.230 align:middle line:84%
There's no car,
there's no nothing.

00:11:54.230 --> 00:11:58.500 align:middle line:84%
So he shut the door again,
came back into the living room.

00:11:58.500 --> 00:12:01.990 align:middle line:84%
And then I remember there
was a huge bolt of lightning,

00:12:01.990 --> 00:12:03.780 align:middle line:90%
which frightened both the dogs.

00:12:03.780 --> 00:12:06.900 align:middle line:84%
They both ran and
hid under the table.

00:12:06.900 --> 00:12:10.340 align:middle line:84%
And it was at that point
that Jason just sat up.

00:12:10.340 --> 00:12:12.290 align:middle line:84%
And it's like his
eyes were wide open,

00:12:12.290 --> 00:12:14.880 align:middle line:90%
but there was nobody home.

00:12:14.880 --> 00:12:17.690 align:middle line:84%
And he just sort of sat
up, swung his legs around.

00:12:17.690 --> 00:12:19.810 align:middle line:90%
And he stood up.

00:12:19.810 --> 00:12:22.100 align:middle line:84%
And he started coming
out with these numbers.

00:12:22.100 --> 00:12:25.140 align:middle line:90%
They were incredible numbers.

00:12:25.140 --> 00:12:27.790 align:middle line:84%
And he was talking about, you
know, to the power of this

00:12:27.790 --> 00:12:31.950 align:middle line:84%
and to the power of-- and binary
codes, and all sorts of things

00:12:31.950 --> 00:12:34.080 align:middle line:84%
that, I mean, he's
a four-year-old.

00:12:34.080 --> 00:12:36.360 align:middle line:84%
He can just about count
to 10 on his fingers.

00:12:36.360 --> 00:12:40.320 align:middle line:84%
So where on earth
was this coming from?

00:12:40.320 --> 00:12:42.855 align:middle line:84%
And of course, there's
my mum and myself sort

00:12:42.855 --> 00:12:45.929 align:middle line:84%
of looking at him,
thinking, what do we do?

00:12:45.929 --> 00:12:46.970 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Was Paul there?

00:12:46.970 --> 00:12:47.980 align:middle line:90%
Did he witness it, too?

00:12:47.980 --> 00:12:50.720 align:middle line:84%
>>ANN: Yeah, Paul
witnessed it, too.

00:12:50.720 --> 00:12:53.040 align:middle line:84%
I believe that there was
another knock at the door.

00:12:53.040 --> 00:12:56.140 align:middle line:84%
And of course, again, Paul
reacted to it, answered it.

00:12:56.140 --> 00:12:57.810 align:middle line:90%
Nobody there.

00:12:57.810 --> 00:13:01.661 align:middle line:84%
Storm was getting
closer, louder.

00:13:01.661 --> 00:13:04.590 align:middle line:84%
And Paul said, well, I
don't know what's going on,

00:13:04.590 --> 00:13:06.060 align:middle line:90%
but I'm not putting up with it.

00:13:06.060 --> 00:13:09.820 align:middle line:84%
And he grabbed the phone
to ring the police.

00:13:09.820 --> 00:13:13.070 align:middle line:84%
And as he did that, the banging
that was on the front door

00:13:13.070 --> 00:13:14.325 align:middle line:90%
started.

00:13:14.325 --> 00:13:16.450 align:middle line:84%
It was like it was coming
from everywhere suddenly.

00:13:16.450 --> 00:13:18.220 align:middle line:84%
It was, like, on
all the windows,

00:13:18.220 --> 00:13:20.680 align:middle line:84%
just as if there were, like,
half a dozen people just

00:13:20.680 --> 00:13:23.490 align:middle line:90%
banging on the glass.

00:13:23.490 --> 00:13:27.200 align:middle line:84%
And this was happening
upstairs as well,

00:13:27.200 --> 00:13:29.660 align:middle line:90%
as if the house was surrounded.

00:13:29.660 --> 00:13:32.787 align:middle line:84%
So there was all this
banging going on.

00:13:32.787 --> 00:13:34.620 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: You must've
been pretty frightened

00:13:34.620 --> 00:13:35.661 align:middle line:90%
by this time, all of you.

00:13:35.661 --> 00:13:37.520 align:middle line:84%
>>ANN: We were
absolutely terrified.

00:13:37.520 --> 00:13:40.370 align:middle line:84%
I mean, Daniel came
running down the stairs,

00:13:40.370 --> 00:13:43.565 align:middle line:84%
because he was terrified
of all the knocking.

00:13:43.565 --> 00:13:47.394 align:middle line:84%
So of course, we sort of
huddled him in the living room.

00:13:47.394 --> 00:13:49.560 align:middle line:84%
And there's myself and my
mom and Daniel sort of all

00:13:49.560 --> 00:13:51.750 align:middle line:90%
huddled together.

00:13:51.750 --> 00:13:53.940 align:middle line:84%
And as I say, Paul was
trying to ring the police,

00:13:53.940 --> 00:13:56.130 align:middle line:90%
but there was no telephone tone.

00:13:56.130 --> 00:13:57.250 align:middle line:90%
There was nothing.

00:13:57.250 --> 00:13:58.810 align:middle line:90%
It was completely dead.

00:13:58.810 --> 00:14:01.600 align:middle line:84%
So basically, he just sort of
threw the phone in temperance.

00:14:01.600 --> 00:14:04.310 align:middle line:90%


00:14:04.310 --> 00:14:06.500 align:middle line:84%
It was like he didn't
know what to do,

00:14:06.500 --> 00:14:08.810 align:middle line:84%
but he was angry,
I think, because he

00:14:08.810 --> 00:14:09.984 align:middle line:90%
should have done something.

00:14:09.984 --> 00:14:11.400 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Well,
because, as a man,

00:14:11.400 --> 00:14:12.790 align:middle line:90%
he couldn't protect his family.

00:14:12.790 --> 00:14:14.295 align:middle line:90%
It's totally out of his control.

00:14:14.295 --> 00:14:15.780 align:middle line:90%
>>ANN: Yeah, exactly.

00:14:15.780 --> 00:14:16.490 align:middle line:90%
Exactly.

00:14:16.490 --> 00:14:21.590 align:middle line:84%
So I can understand how
he must have been feeling.

00:14:21.590 --> 00:14:25.760 align:middle line:84%
And Jason was still coming
out with these numbers.

00:14:25.760 --> 00:14:28.090 align:middle line:84%
And then all of a
sudden, he stopped.

00:14:28.090 --> 00:14:30.760 align:middle line:84%
And as he stopped
talking, all the knocking

00:14:30.760 --> 00:14:32.955 align:middle line:90%
stopped just completely.

00:14:32.955 --> 00:14:37.240 align:middle line:84%
It didn't just die down,
it just stopped completely.

00:14:37.240 --> 00:14:41.140 align:middle line:84%
And with that, he started
walking towards the door.

00:14:41.140 --> 00:14:43.050 align:middle line:84%
And Paul reached down
and picked him up,

00:14:43.050 --> 00:14:45.240 align:middle line:90%
and he sort of held him close.

00:14:45.240 --> 00:14:47.850 align:middle line:84%
And Jason sort of
pushed away from him.

00:14:47.850 --> 00:14:50.696 align:middle line:84%
He still had the
vacant expression.

00:14:50.696 --> 00:14:53.970 align:middle line:84%
And of course, Paul was
trying to hug him and say

00:14:53.970 --> 00:14:57.460 align:middle line:84%
to him-- well, he did
say to him, he said,

00:14:57.460 --> 00:14:59.080 align:middle line:90%
what's wrong, boy?

00:14:59.080 --> 00:15:01.690 align:middle line:90%
He said, what are you doing?

00:15:01.690 --> 00:15:04.285 align:middle line:84%
And Jason just, without
even looking at him,

00:15:04.285 --> 00:15:08.060 align:middle line:84%
just said, I have to go
because they're waiting for me,

00:15:08.060 --> 00:15:10.890 align:middle line:90%
which was quite terrifying.

00:15:10.890 --> 00:15:12.650 align:middle line:84%
And then the knocking
started again,

00:15:12.650 --> 00:15:16.400 align:middle line:84%
almost as if, you know, sort
of like a crescendo for him

00:15:16.400 --> 00:15:18.577 align:middle line:90%
to go to the door.

00:15:18.577 --> 00:15:20.910 align:middle line:84%
And of course, Paul was holding
him tighter and tighter,

00:15:20.910 --> 00:15:23.210 align:middle line:84%
and rocking him,
and saying, come on,

00:15:23.210 --> 00:15:24.941 align:middle line:84%
boy, come back,
come back, wake up.

00:15:24.941 --> 00:15:26.690 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Oh, he must
have been so scared.

00:15:26.690 --> 00:15:28.920 align:middle line:84%
>>ANN: It was absolutely--
I can't tell you

00:15:28.920 --> 00:15:30.165 align:middle line:90%
how terrifying it was.

00:15:30.165 --> 00:15:32.690 align:middle line:90%
It was absolutely horrendous.

00:15:32.690 --> 00:15:35.450 align:middle line:84%
But at that point,
he started blinking,

00:15:35.450 --> 00:15:40.360 align:middle line:84%
almost as if whatever trance he
was in, he was coming out of.

00:15:40.360 --> 00:15:42.580 align:middle line:84%
And the more he
started blinking,

00:15:42.580 --> 00:15:45.790 align:middle line:84%
again, the more the
noise died down.

00:15:45.790 --> 00:15:48.910 align:middle line:84%
And then suddenly, it was like
he was wide awake and sort of

00:15:48.910 --> 00:15:49.980 align:middle line:90%
looked around him.

00:15:49.980 --> 00:15:52.080 align:middle line:90%
And he said, oh, hello, daddy.

00:15:52.080 --> 00:15:55.480 align:middle line:84%
Or I know it's late,
but can we watch TV?

00:15:55.480 --> 00:15:59.150 align:middle line:84%
And he had no idea
what had gone on.

00:15:59.150 --> 00:16:02.310 align:middle line:84%
So of course, Paul just
put him down gently

00:16:02.310 --> 00:16:04.800 align:middle line:84%
and said, yes, you can
watch the television.

00:16:04.800 --> 00:16:07.840 align:middle line:84%
And switched the TV
on for both the boys.

00:16:07.840 --> 00:16:11.580 align:middle line:84%
And of course, I'm saying
to him, what's going on,

00:16:11.580 --> 00:16:14.060 align:middle line:84%
Paul, what is it,
what's happening?

00:16:14.060 --> 00:16:15.520 align:middle line:90%
And he said, I don't know.

00:16:15.520 --> 00:16:18.690 align:middle line:84%
He said, I'm going to
try the phone again.

00:16:18.690 --> 00:16:20.260 align:middle line:90%
And the phone worked this time.

00:16:20.260 --> 00:16:21.880 align:middle line:90%
It worked perfectly.

00:16:21.880 --> 00:16:22.970 align:middle line:90%
He phoned the police.

00:16:22.970 --> 00:16:24.841 align:middle line:90%
He told them what happened.

00:16:24.841 --> 00:16:26.840 align:middle line:84%
Obviously, he didn't
mention Jason's part in it.

00:16:26.840 --> 00:16:30.560 align:middle line:84%
But he said about
all the knocking.

00:16:30.560 --> 00:16:33.850 align:middle line:84%
And within a few minutes,
there was a police car outside.

00:16:33.850 --> 00:16:35.170 align:middle line:90%
Officer knocked at the door.

00:16:35.170 --> 00:16:38.806 align:middle line:84%
And Paul actually went
outside with him with a torch.

00:16:38.806 --> 00:16:39.930 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Flashlight, yeah.

00:16:39.930 --> 00:16:40.430 align:middle line:90%
>>ANN: Yeah.

00:16:40.430 --> 00:16:40.929 align:middle line:90%
Sorry.

00:16:40.929 --> 00:16:41.730 align:middle line:90%
Flashlight, yes.

00:16:41.730 --> 00:16:41.990 align:middle line:90%
Sorry.

00:16:41.990 --> 00:16:44.323 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Otherwise, we vision
you out in the-- [LAUGHS]

00:16:44.323 --> 00:16:45.900 align:middle line:90%
>>ANN: Yes, a torch, yes.

00:16:45.900 --> 00:16:47.990 align:middle line:90%
Sorry.

00:16:47.990 --> 00:16:48.850 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:16:48.850 --> 00:16:51.730 align:middle line:84%
>>ANN: So Paul went
outside with the officer,

00:16:51.730 --> 00:16:54.120 align:middle line:90%
and they both had flashlights.

00:16:54.120 --> 00:16:57.840 align:middle line:84%
And they were looking around
the gardens around the grounds.

00:16:57.840 --> 00:17:00.020 align:middle line:84%
And then the police officer
came back with Paul.

00:17:00.020 --> 00:17:03.080 align:middle line:84%
And I opened the door for them,
and he said, well, he says,

00:17:03.080 --> 00:17:06.030 align:middle line:84%
it's the strangest thing, but
there's no footprints anywhere.

00:17:06.030 --> 00:17:06.592 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: OK.

00:17:06.592 --> 00:17:08.050 align:middle line:84%
Now, at this point,
you had to have

00:17:08.050 --> 00:17:11.109 align:middle line:84%
started asking different kinds
of questions about Jason--

00:17:11.109 --> 00:17:13.445 align:middle line:84%
if not then all the
knocking and rattling.

00:17:13.445 --> 00:17:14.790 align:middle line:90%
>>ANN: Yeah, exactly.

00:17:14.790 --> 00:17:16.410 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Did
anyone note anything

00:17:16.410 --> 00:17:18.910 align:middle line:84%
he was saying, these numeric
codes or, as you say,

00:17:18.910 --> 00:17:20.995 align:middle line:84%
binary codes or
sequences or anything?

00:17:20.995 --> 00:17:21.920 align:middle line:90%
>>ANN: No.

00:17:21.920 --> 00:17:23.380 align:middle line:90%
It was just so fluent.

00:17:23.380 --> 00:17:26.339 align:middle line:84%
It was like he didn't stop
and think about anything.

00:17:26.339 --> 00:17:29.770 align:middle line:84%
It was just computer
fashion, if you like.

00:17:29.770 --> 00:17:30.992 align:middle line:90%
It was just spewing out.

00:17:30.992 --> 00:17:33.200 align:middle line:84%
I mean, obviously, at the
time, we didn't think, oh--

00:17:33.200 --> 00:17:34.330 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: You wouldn't
think to say, well,

00:17:34.330 --> 00:17:34.920 align:middle line:90%
let's write this down.

00:17:34.920 --> 00:17:35.180 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:17:35.180 --> 00:17:35.680 align:middle line:90%
>>ANN: Yeah.

00:17:35.680 --> 00:17:36.389 align:middle line:90%
Let's write that.

00:17:36.389 --> 00:17:37.763 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: You were
just terrified

00:17:37.763 --> 00:17:40.310 align:middle line:84%
that this is coming out of
your robotic-like little boy.

00:17:40.310 --> 00:17:41.220 align:middle line:90%
>>ANN: Exactly.

00:17:41.220 --> 00:17:42.490 align:middle line:90%
Exactly.

00:17:42.490 --> 00:17:44.200 align:middle line:90%
Why is this happening?

00:17:44.200 --> 00:17:49.170 align:middle line:84%
But I mean, after that-- I'd
say we had no answers to it.

00:17:49.170 --> 00:17:50.480 align:middle line:90%
We just didn't have answers.

00:17:50.480 --> 00:17:54.520 align:middle line:84%
But again, being a very
rational person-- well,

00:17:54.520 --> 00:17:57.150 align:middle line:84%
myself and Paul, but
Paul more than me.

00:17:57.150 --> 00:18:00.890 align:middle line:84%
He just said, oh, it must
have been a nightmare.

00:18:00.890 --> 00:18:04.120 align:middle line:84%
Perhaps all we were
hearing was the storm.

00:18:04.120 --> 00:18:07.510 align:middle line:84%
So of course, over a few weeks,
you start to question again.

00:18:07.510 --> 00:18:10.440 align:middle line:84%
You start thinking,
well, was it?

00:18:10.440 --> 00:18:11.060 align:middle line:90%
Is it--

00:18:11.060 --> 00:18:11.910 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Mm-hm.

00:18:11.910 --> 00:18:13.460 align:middle line:90%
You're asking the questions.

00:18:13.460 --> 00:18:14.950 align:middle line:84%
Maybe he couldn't afford
to ask those questions.

00:18:14.950 --> 00:18:15.690 align:middle line:90%
>>ANN: Exactly.

00:18:15.690 --> 00:18:17.510 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: You know, emotionally.

00:18:17.510 --> 00:18:21.000 align:middle line:84%
Now, was there a point
at which you took Jason

00:18:21.000 --> 00:18:24.000 align:middle line:84%
to a psychologist
or something to see

00:18:24.000 --> 00:18:26.420 align:middle line:84%
if anything odd was
going on with him?

00:18:26.420 --> 00:18:27.755 align:middle line:90%
Or an expert of some kind?

00:18:27.755 --> 00:18:29.600 align:middle line:90%
>>ANN: Yes, we did.

00:18:29.600 --> 00:18:34.270 align:middle line:84%
As I say, this went
on not continuously,

00:18:34.270 --> 00:18:37.420 align:middle line:84%
but it'd go on for a
few months at a time.

00:18:37.420 --> 00:18:38.864 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Same
kind of experience

00:18:38.864 --> 00:18:40.280 align:middle line:84%
or a different
kind of experience?

00:18:40.280 --> 00:18:44.040 align:middle line:84%
>>ANN: No, same-- very
similar sort of experience.

00:18:44.040 --> 00:18:47.400 align:middle line:84%
And it wasn't until he was
12 years old that we finally

00:18:47.400 --> 00:18:51.420 align:middle line:84%
sort of got an idea
of what was going on.

00:18:51.420 --> 00:18:53.690 align:middle line:84%
And I suppose even
then, at that time,

00:18:53.690 --> 00:18:56.500 align:middle line:84%
it wasn't necessarily
that we believed him.

00:18:56.500 --> 00:18:59.274 align:middle line:84%
It was that we believed
that he believed it.

00:18:59.274 --> 00:18:59.940 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:18:59.940 --> 00:19:01.980 align:middle line:84%
And there is still
other events to come

00:19:01.980 --> 00:19:05.790 align:middle line:84%
before you would actually
embrace all of this.

00:19:05.790 --> 00:19:10.044 align:middle line:84%
He had a birthmark
of some sort, right?

00:19:10.044 --> 00:19:11.960 align:middle line:84%
Did he have some kind
of birthmark on his body

00:19:11.960 --> 00:19:12.820 align:middle line:90%
that was different?

00:19:12.820 --> 00:19:14.490 align:middle line:84%
>>ANN: He didn't
have a birthmark,

00:19:14.490 --> 00:19:17.135 align:middle line:84%
but he came back
from an experience--

00:19:17.135 --> 00:19:19.150 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Oh, I
see, with the marks.

00:19:19.150 --> 00:19:20.540 align:middle line:90%
>>ANN: Yes, with a mark.

00:19:20.540 --> 00:19:22.950 align:middle line:84%
This particular mark I
think you're referring to

00:19:22.950 --> 00:19:24.950 align:middle line:90%
was a triangle.

00:19:24.950 --> 00:19:27.460 align:middle line:84%
Because when he was
12, we were taking

00:19:27.460 --> 00:19:30.020 align:middle line:90%
him to see a child psychologist.

00:19:30.020 --> 00:19:31.570 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Not surprising.

00:19:31.570 --> 00:19:32.826 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHTER]

00:19:32.826 --> 00:19:33.325 align:middle line:90%


00:19:33.325 --> 00:19:36.100 align:middle line:84%
>>ANN: I mean, I would
add that she'd sent him

00:19:36.100 --> 00:19:37.770 align:middle line:84%
to the hospital
for various tests.

00:19:37.770 --> 00:19:40.015 align:middle line:84%
He'd had things put
all over his head and--

00:19:40.015 --> 00:19:41.056 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: MRIs, all that.

00:19:41.056 --> 00:19:43.980 align:middle line:84%
>>ANN: Yeah, all
that sort of thing.

00:19:43.980 --> 00:19:46.994 align:middle line:84%
Test for sleep epilepsy,
everything they could think of.

00:19:46.994 --> 00:19:48.660 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And he was
coming up negative?

00:19:48.660 --> 00:19:51.700 align:middle line:84%
>>ANN: He was completely
negative on all of them.

00:19:51.700 --> 00:19:53.580 align:middle line:84%
So of course, she was
still working with him,

00:19:53.580 --> 00:19:57.000 align:middle line:84%
trying to find out
what was happening.

00:19:57.000 --> 00:19:58.990 align:middle line:84%
And he used to call
her the Finger Lady,

00:19:58.990 --> 00:20:02.785 align:middle line:84%
actually, because she used to
say "the little people," so--

00:20:02.785 --> 00:20:04.080 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Oh, I see, yeah.

00:20:04.080 --> 00:20:06.805 align:middle line:84%
>>ANN: He used to say, oh, I'm
going to see the Finger Lady.

00:20:06.805 --> 00:20:08.740 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Demeaning
to him, actually,

00:20:08.740 --> 00:20:10.680 align:middle line:84%
considering what he knew
and had been through.

00:20:10.680 --> 00:20:11.180 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:20:11.180 --> 00:20:11.980 align:middle line:90%
>>ANN: Exactly.

00:20:11.980 --> 00:20:14.450 align:middle line:90%
Exactly.

00:20:14.450 --> 00:20:18.410 align:middle line:84%
He came back from an experience
this time with this triangle.

00:20:18.410 --> 00:20:22.550 align:middle line:84%
It was like a two-inch
perfect triangle on his side.

00:20:22.550 --> 00:20:23.803 align:middle line:90%
But it was very red.

00:20:23.803 --> 00:20:24.740 align:middle line:90%
It was bright red.

00:20:24.740 --> 00:20:26.560 align:middle line:84%
But it was like the
skin was raised.

00:20:26.560 --> 00:20:29.310 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:20:29.310 --> 00:20:31.040 align:middle line:84%
>>ANN: The best
will in the world.

00:20:31.040 --> 00:20:33.670 align:middle line:84%
You can't think
how anybody could

00:20:33.670 --> 00:20:39.260 align:middle line:84%
do that, how you could
even get a mark like that.

00:20:39.260 --> 00:20:42.100 align:middle line:84%
Obviously, Jason was
really upset at this,

00:20:42.100 --> 00:20:43.740 align:middle line:90%
because it was quite painful.

00:20:43.740 --> 00:20:49.430 align:middle line:84%
But to us, it was like, we've
got proof, we've got something.

00:20:49.430 --> 00:20:53.710 align:middle line:84%
And he had an appointment that
day with the psychologist.

00:20:53.710 --> 00:20:55.930 align:middle line:84%
So of course, we sort
of marched him in there

00:20:55.930 --> 00:20:58.700 align:middle line:84%
and pulled up his shirt, and
said, right, explain that.

00:20:58.700 --> 00:21:00.960 align:middle line:90%
Tell us what that is.

00:21:00.960 --> 00:21:03.550 align:middle line:84%
And I remember her
sort of looking at it.

00:21:03.550 --> 00:21:04.849 align:middle line:90%
She raised her glasses.

00:21:04.849 --> 00:21:06.390 align:middle line:84%
And then she said,
oh, wait a minute.

00:21:06.390 --> 00:21:08.270 align:middle line:84%
And she went out
and she came back

00:21:08.270 --> 00:21:11.040 align:middle line:84%
with about four or
five of her colleagues.

00:21:11.040 --> 00:21:13.030 align:middle line:84%
And they were all sort
of poking and prodding

00:21:13.030 --> 00:21:17.050 align:middle line:84%
and sort of, well,
we can't explain it.

00:21:17.050 --> 00:21:19.750 align:middle line:90%
How did it get-- what is it?

00:21:19.750 --> 00:21:22.790 align:middle line:84%
And she looked at it again
by the end of the session.

00:21:22.790 --> 00:21:27.310 align:middle line:84%
And it faded to just a very
sort of lightish pink color,

00:21:27.310 --> 00:21:31.210 align:middle line:84%
and the skin had
gone back to normal.

00:21:31.210 --> 00:21:33.470 align:middle line:84%
And she just looked at
us, and she said, well,

00:21:33.470 --> 00:21:35.940 align:middle line:90%
I don't know what to say.

00:21:35.940 --> 00:21:37.870 align:middle line:84%
I mean, we do have
that in writing,

00:21:37.870 --> 00:21:42.090 align:middle line:84%
because she actually
wrote to our GP about it.

00:21:42.090 --> 00:21:44.310 align:middle line:84%
But the good thing was
she also wrote to our GP

00:21:44.310 --> 00:21:48.700 align:middle line:84%
and said Jason is not psychotic
in any way whatsoever.

00:21:48.700 --> 00:21:52.050 align:middle line:84%
And so in other words, what
he's saying is the truth.

00:21:52.050 --> 00:21:53.200 align:middle line:90%
And he's not ill.

00:21:53.200 --> 00:21:54.070 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Now, how old
was he at this point?

00:21:54.070 --> 00:21:54.780 align:middle line:84%
>>ANN: He was 12 years
old at that point.

00:21:54.780 --> 00:21:56.010 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: OK.

00:21:56.010 --> 00:21:58.540 align:middle line:84%
There have been many
years that have passed.

00:21:58.540 --> 00:22:01.930 align:middle line:84%
What was he saying was
happening to him as he--

00:22:01.930 --> 00:22:03.467 align:middle line:84%
did he speak to
you often about it,

00:22:03.467 --> 00:22:05.915 align:middle line:90%
or did you have to prod him?

00:22:05.915 --> 00:22:09.190 align:middle line:84%
>>ANN: He used to be
extremely, extremely upset

00:22:09.190 --> 00:22:12.560 align:middle line:90%
about each time he was taken.

00:22:12.560 --> 00:22:16.860 align:middle line:84%
I mean, I remember he would
say to us-- he would say,

00:22:16.860 --> 00:22:18.080 align:middle line:90%
they're coming tonight.

00:22:18.080 --> 00:22:20.140 align:middle line:84%
And we would say, well,
how do you know this?

00:22:20.140 --> 00:22:22.305 align:middle line:84%
And he said that
I get a feeling.

00:22:22.305 --> 00:22:24.780 align:middle line:84%
And he said, I just get
a feeling in my head

00:22:24.780 --> 00:22:26.660 align:middle line:90%
that they'll be here.

00:22:26.660 --> 00:22:29.250 align:middle line:84%
And I remember one
night, Paul actually

00:22:29.250 --> 00:22:31.480 align:middle line:84%
sat up in his bedroom
armed with a baseball

00:22:31.480 --> 00:22:36.450 align:middle line:84%
bat and a flask of
coffee to keep him awake.

00:22:36.450 --> 00:22:39.120 align:middle line:84%
And he was woken up by
Jason sort of a few hours

00:22:39.120 --> 00:22:42.090 align:middle line:84%
later, saying, well, thanks for
nothing, Dad, you fell asleep.

00:22:42.090 --> 00:22:44.520 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Well, I'm sure he
had help falling asleep, too.

00:22:44.520 --> 00:22:45.120 align:middle line:90%
>>ANN: He did.

00:22:45.120 --> 00:22:48.850 align:middle line:90%
I'm sure he did.

00:22:48.850 --> 00:22:51.180 align:middle line:84%
I think the turning
point, really--

00:22:51.180 --> 00:22:54.520 align:middle line:84%
and I think if you were to
speak to Jason, say, well,

00:22:54.520 --> 00:22:56.810 align:middle line:90%
when did it change for you?

00:22:56.810 --> 00:22:58.964 align:middle line:90%
When did it stop being fearful?

00:22:58.964 --> 00:23:00.380 align:middle line:84%
He would always
say, well, the day

00:23:00.380 --> 00:23:02.110 align:middle line:84%
my mom and dad said
they believe me.

00:23:02.110 --> 00:23:03.220 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:23:03.220 --> 00:23:04.070 align:middle line:90%
I bet.

00:23:04.070 --> 00:23:06.105 align:middle line:84%
How lonely and
frightening for a kid--

00:23:06.105 --> 00:23:06.750 align:middle line:90%
>>ANN: Exactly.

00:23:06.750 --> 00:23:08.290 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: --to think
they have no support,

00:23:08.290 --> 00:23:09.100 align:middle line:90%
no one believes them.

00:23:09.100 --> 00:23:09.650 align:middle line:90%
>>ANN: Yes.

00:23:09.650 --> 00:23:10.790 align:middle line:90%
Yeah, that must have been awful.

00:23:10.790 --> 00:23:13.331 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Did it help that he--
when the diagnosis came back,

00:23:13.331 --> 00:23:15.140 align:middle line:90%
they said he's fine?

00:23:15.140 --> 00:23:16.590 align:middle line:90%
>>ANN: It helped a lot.

00:23:16.590 --> 00:23:18.497 align:middle line:90%
Yes, it did help tremendously.

00:23:18.497 --> 00:23:20.330 align:middle line:10%
>>REGINA: Well, there
were some other things

00:23:20.330 --> 00:23:21.190 align:middle line:10%
that happened, too.

00:23:21.190 --> 00:23:23.140 align:middle line:90%
And there was a cryptic remark.

00:23:23.140 --> 00:23:25.110 align:middle line:84%
First of all, the
beings that visited

00:23:25.110 --> 00:23:28.290 align:middle line:84%
Daniel were very different than
the ones that visited Jason,

00:23:28.290 --> 00:23:28.790 align:middle line:90%
right?

00:23:28.790 --> 00:23:29.310 align:middle line:90%
>>ANN: Yes, they were.

00:23:29.310 --> 00:23:30.490 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So let's talk
about the difference

00:23:30.490 --> 00:23:33.140 align:middle line:84%
between those beings and
also a kind of cryptic remark

00:23:33.140 --> 00:23:35.145 align:middle line:90%
they made about Jason to Daniel.

00:23:35.145 --> 00:23:37.100 align:middle line:90%
>>ANN: OK.

00:23:37.100 --> 00:23:39.770 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

00:23:39.770 --> 00:23:42.000 align:middle line:84%
Obviously, they're brothers,
they love each other.

00:23:42.000 --> 00:23:44.370 align:middle line:90%
But they're chalk and cheese.

00:23:44.370 --> 00:23:47.240 align:middle line:84%
Daniel is very outgoing,
very extrovert.

00:23:47.240 --> 00:23:50.900 align:middle line:84%
I mean, we've always said,
he's virtually horizontal.

00:23:50.900 --> 00:23:53.150 align:middle line:90%
He's that easygoing.

00:23:53.150 --> 00:23:57.320 align:middle line:84%
Whereas Daniel was always
happy with the visitations.

00:23:57.320 --> 00:23:59.700 align:middle line:84%
He sort of looked
forward to them,

00:23:59.700 --> 00:24:02.130 align:middle line:84%
because, I mean, I would
remember going up and knocking

00:24:02.130 --> 00:24:03.671 align:middle line:84%
on his door at night,
because I could

00:24:03.671 --> 00:24:05.567 align:middle line:84%
hear him talking and
giggling and laughing.

00:24:05.567 --> 00:24:07.650 align:middle line:84%
And then I'd open the door,
and obviously, there'd

00:24:07.650 --> 00:24:08.320 align:middle line:90%
be nobody there.

00:24:08.320 --> 00:24:11.670 align:middle line:84%
And he'd say, oh, thanks, mum,
you frightened Joonas away now.

00:24:11.670 --> 00:24:13.920 align:middle line:84%
So again, you think,
invisible friend.

00:24:13.920 --> 00:24:16.967 align:middle line:84%
You just say, I'm sorry,
son, shut the door.

00:24:16.967 --> 00:24:18.550 align:middle line:84%
But of course, Jason
was the opposite.

00:24:18.550 --> 00:24:19.640 align:middle line:90%
He was absolutely terrified.

00:24:19.640 --> 00:24:21.473 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: What was the
nature of his beings?

00:24:21.473 --> 00:24:24.420 align:middle line:84%
What did the beings Daniel
was experiencing look like?

00:24:24.420 --> 00:24:27.930 align:middle line:84%
>>ANN: He said that
they were very tall.

00:24:27.930 --> 00:24:30.060 align:middle line:84%
He said, look,
taller than Daddy.

00:24:30.060 --> 00:24:32.020 align:middle line:90%
Paul's six feet tall.

00:24:32.020 --> 00:24:35.140 align:middle line:84%
So he said that they
were taller than him.

00:24:35.140 --> 00:24:37.870 align:middle line:84%
But he said they were
very-- well, as a child,

00:24:37.870 --> 00:24:40.440 align:middle line:84%
he described them
as pretty people.

00:24:40.440 --> 00:24:43.960 align:middle line:90%
He said, very nice-looking.

00:24:43.960 --> 00:24:45.250 align:middle line:90%
Very bright blue eyes.

00:24:45.250 --> 00:24:47.720 align:middle line:90%
Blonde hair.

00:24:47.720 --> 00:24:49.980 align:middle line:84%
And he said-- he
said that they look

00:24:49.980 --> 00:24:53.070 align:middle line:84%
like they go on holiday a
lot, because their skin was

00:24:53.070 --> 00:24:54.600 align:middle line:90%
sort of darker, like tanned.

00:24:54.600 --> 00:24:57.950 align:middle line:90%


00:24:57.950 --> 00:25:01.610 align:middle line:84%
Yeah, you said about the remark
that they said to Daniel.

00:25:01.610 --> 00:25:02.390 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:25:02.390 --> 00:25:05.450 align:middle line:84%
That was just after
Jason was born, actually.

00:25:05.450 --> 00:25:07.530 align:middle line:84%
I remember Daniel
coming into the kitchen

00:25:07.530 --> 00:25:08.610 align:middle line:90%
crying his eyes out.

00:25:08.610 --> 00:25:11.130 align:middle line:84%
And of course, I said,
what's the matter?

00:25:11.130 --> 00:25:13.780 align:middle line:84%
And he said, Joonas
came last night,

00:25:13.780 --> 00:25:17.270 align:middle line:84%
and he said that he can't
see me again for a while.

00:25:17.270 --> 00:25:19.245 align:middle line:84%
And again, believing
it's an invisible friend,

00:25:19.245 --> 00:25:21.720 align:middle line:84%
I just cuddled him, said,
oh, well never mind, mate.

00:25:21.720 --> 00:25:24.820 align:middle line:84%
You've got your brother now,
and you've got mummy and daddy.

00:25:24.820 --> 00:25:26.220 align:middle line:90%
And he said, no.

00:25:26.220 --> 00:25:30.660 align:middle line:84%
He said, he told me that
they've made a mistake

00:25:30.660 --> 00:25:35.690 align:middle line:84%
and that it's Jason they need
to be working with, not me.

00:25:35.690 --> 00:25:37.800 align:middle line:84%
And that sort of
took me back a bit.

00:25:37.800 --> 00:25:40.950 align:middle line:84%
And then he looked at
me, and he said, mummy,

00:25:40.950 --> 00:25:43.800 align:middle line:84%
Joonas said Jason's
got an original soul.

00:25:43.800 --> 00:25:45.116 align:middle line:90%
He said, what's that?

00:25:45.116 --> 00:25:46.240 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: An original soul.

00:25:46.240 --> 00:25:48.150 align:middle line:90%
>>ANN: An original soul, yes.

00:25:48.150 --> 00:25:50.390 align:middle line:84%
So of course, at that
time, I couldn't answer it.

00:25:50.390 --> 00:25:52.749 align:middle line:84%
So I just sort of did
the usual mum thing

00:25:52.749 --> 00:25:54.540 align:middle line:84%
and said, oh, ask daddy
when he comes home.

00:25:54.540 --> 00:25:56.690 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: I've got chills.

00:25:56.690 --> 00:25:58.620 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

00:25:58.620 --> 00:26:02.120 align:middle line:84%
And so at that-- somewhere
around that time, as I recall,

00:26:02.120 --> 00:26:04.420 align:middle line:84%
there was a television
program that you

00:26:04.420 --> 00:26:07.760 align:middle line:84%
saw that started helping
you understand some things?

00:26:07.760 --> 00:26:08.820 align:middle line:90%
>>ANN: That's correct.

00:26:08.820 --> 00:26:11.210 align:middle line:90%
Yes, that was when Jason was 12.

00:26:11.210 --> 00:26:13.030 align:middle line:90%
That, for us, was the catalyst.

00:26:13.030 --> 00:26:15.920 align:middle line:90%
That changed everything.

00:26:15.920 --> 00:26:19.710 align:middle line:84%
Like I said, Jason
was-- well, we

00:26:19.710 --> 00:26:21.780 align:middle line:84%
were all watching this
program, bearing in mind

00:26:21.780 --> 00:26:24.810 align:middle line:90%
that Daniel was 16 now as well.

00:26:24.810 --> 00:26:27.490 align:middle line:84%
And it was a hypnosis
program where they use it

00:26:27.490 --> 00:26:29.710 align:middle line:84%
for entertainment,
and then they use

00:26:29.710 --> 00:26:31.830 align:middle line:84%
it to help someone get
over the fear of spiders,

00:26:31.830 --> 00:26:34.729 align:middle line:84%
stop smoking, that
sort of thing.

00:26:34.729 --> 00:26:36.270 align:middle line:84%
And then you know
when they give you,

00:26:36.270 --> 00:26:39.445 align:middle line:84%
like, a juicy bit just before
the break to keep you watching?

00:26:39.445 --> 00:26:40.170 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Mm-hm.

00:26:40.170 --> 00:26:41.295 align:middle line:90%
A tease, they call it.

00:26:41.295 --> 00:26:43.380 align:middle line:90%
>>ANN: Oh, right.

00:26:43.380 --> 00:26:45.860 align:middle line:84%
And this guy said,
oh, when we come back,

00:26:45.860 --> 00:26:47.224 align:middle line:90%
we'll be talking to this man.

00:26:47.224 --> 00:26:48.640 align:middle line:84%
And then they
showed you this guy.

00:26:48.640 --> 00:26:51.940 align:middle line:84%
And he was absolutely
petrified of the dark.

00:26:51.940 --> 00:26:53.750 align:middle line:10%
And he said that
he had to remember

00:26:53.750 --> 00:26:57.730 align:middle line:10%
what happened to him, because he
was driving his lorry late one

00:26:57.730 --> 00:27:02.110 align:middle line:10%
night, and he remembers a
bright light and then nothing.

00:27:02.110 --> 00:27:06.990 align:middle line:84%
But he had, I think, three
hours of missing time.

00:27:06.990 --> 00:27:09.170 align:middle line:10%
And it was at that
point that-- I

00:27:09.170 --> 00:27:10.690 align:middle line:10%
mean, obviously,
us three just said,

00:27:10.690 --> 00:27:12.170 align:middle line:10%
oh, that sounds interesting.

00:27:12.170 --> 00:27:13.820 align:middle line:90%
You know, we'll watch that.

00:27:13.820 --> 00:27:15.870 align:middle line:84%
And it was at that point
that Jason stood up.

00:27:15.870 --> 00:27:17.900 align:middle line:84%
And he had tears
running down his face.

00:27:17.900 --> 00:27:20.060 align:middle line:84%
And he picked something
up, an ornament,

00:27:20.060 --> 00:27:22.090 align:middle line:90%
threw it at the TV set.

00:27:22.090 --> 00:27:24.590 align:middle line:84%
And of course, Paul jumped up
and said, what the hell do you

00:27:24.590 --> 00:27:26.110 align:middle line:90%
think you're doing?

00:27:26.110 --> 00:27:28.830 align:middle line:84%
And he just turned round to
us, and he was just, like,

00:27:28.830 --> 00:27:29.750 align:middle line:90%
screaming at us.

00:27:29.750 --> 00:27:32.350 align:middle line:84%
He said, that man on
there is so stupid.

00:27:32.350 --> 00:27:34.600 align:middle line:84%
He said, he shouldn't
want to remember,

00:27:34.600 --> 00:27:39.010 align:middle line:84%
he said-- because he said, I
remember-- he said everything,

00:27:39.010 --> 00:27:41.260 align:middle line:84%
he said, and I don't
want to remember.

00:27:41.260 --> 00:27:43.930 align:middle line:84%
And he just fled out of
the room into the kitchen.

00:27:43.930 --> 00:27:46.120 align:middle line:90%
And we were just a bit stunned.

00:27:46.120 --> 00:27:49.936 align:middle line:84%
Paul just looked at me
and went, what's going on?

00:27:49.936 --> 00:27:53.470 align:middle line:84%
And it was at that point that
Daniel, bearing in mind, who's

00:27:53.470 --> 00:27:57.720 align:middle line:84%
now 16, he just looked at us
rather contemptuously and said,

00:27:57.720 --> 00:27:59.780 align:middle line:90%
don't you both get it yet?

00:27:59.780 --> 00:28:01.680 align:middle line:90%
And we were like, get what?

00:28:01.680 --> 00:28:05.570 align:middle line:10%
And that's when he came
out with, he started off

00:28:05.570 --> 00:28:09.960 align:middle line:10%
by telling us, do you remember
when I told you about Joonas

00:28:09.960 --> 00:28:11.870 align:middle line:10%
and I said that
Joonas had told me

00:28:11.870 --> 00:28:14.300 align:middle line:10%
that they've made a
mistake, that they should

00:28:14.300 --> 00:28:16.856 align:middle line:10%
be working with
Jason and not me?

00:28:16.856 --> 00:28:19.100 align:middle line:10%
And I said, yes, I
do remember that.

00:28:19.100 --> 00:28:22.250 align:middle line:10%
And he said, mom, he
said, he's being taken.

00:28:22.250 --> 00:28:27.970 align:middle line:84%
He said, for god's sake, I
thought you would've got that.

00:28:27.970 --> 00:28:30.370 align:middle line:84%
And I just looked at
him, and I said, well,

00:28:30.370 --> 00:28:32.360 align:middle line:90%
you've never said anything.

00:28:32.360 --> 00:28:36.225 align:middle line:84%
And he said, well, I thought
his shrink would have got it out

00:28:36.225 --> 00:28:37.446 align:middle line:90%
of him by now.

00:28:37.446 --> 00:28:38.820 align:middle line:84%
Because, obviously,
at that time,

00:28:38.820 --> 00:28:41.570 align:middle line:84%
we were taking him
to the psychologist.

00:28:41.570 --> 00:28:45.280 align:middle line:84%
He said, so I thought she would
have got it out of him by now.

00:28:45.280 --> 00:28:46.980 align:middle line:84%
And of course, Paul
just looked at him

00:28:46.980 --> 00:28:49.280 align:middle line:84%
and said, oh, don't
be ridiculous.

00:28:49.280 --> 00:28:52.810 align:middle line:84%
It just wasn't something that
he could get his head around.

00:28:52.810 --> 00:28:54.710 align:middle line:90%
Well, I couldn't.

00:28:54.710 --> 00:28:58.320 align:middle line:84%
But we went into the
kitchen, and Daniel came out.

00:28:58.320 --> 00:29:01.150 align:middle line:84%
And he said, mum, you've got
to help him, because, he said,

00:29:01.150 --> 00:29:03.100 align:middle line:90%
he's terrified.

00:29:03.100 --> 00:29:05.960 align:middle line:84%
He said, you've got
to do something.

00:29:05.960 --> 00:29:08.390 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Now let's go into
the experience he was having.

00:29:08.390 --> 00:29:11.660 align:middle line:84%
Once there was dialogue,
you were able to find out.

00:29:11.660 --> 00:29:13.990 align:middle line:84%
When he would-- How
did he leave the room

00:29:13.990 --> 00:29:16.750 align:middle line:84%
and go aboard the craft,
in his description?

00:29:16.750 --> 00:29:19.925 align:middle line:84%
And once he got there, what
were they doing with him?

00:29:19.925 --> 00:29:22.200 align:middle line:84%
>>ANN: Well, as I said,
that was the first time

00:29:22.200 --> 00:29:26.630 align:middle line:84%
that we'd actually asked him
to describe what was happening.

00:29:26.630 --> 00:29:28.250 align:middle line:90%
And he went into detail.

00:29:28.250 --> 00:29:32.950 align:middle line:84%
And he said that after they
float him through the walls

00:29:32.950 --> 00:29:35.960 align:middle line:84%
or through the window,
he said, there's no pain.

00:29:35.960 --> 00:29:40.980 align:middle line:84%
He said, it feels like you're--
like being pulled through

00:29:40.980 --> 00:29:46.000 align:middle line:84%
something like treacle, like
molasses, something like that.

00:29:46.000 --> 00:29:51.690 align:middle line:84%
He said, it's like a thick
feeling, if that makes sense.

00:29:51.690 --> 00:29:56.320 align:middle line:84%
He said, but once you're on the
other side, you don't get that.

00:29:56.320 --> 00:29:59.350 align:middle line:84%
And then he said,
sometimes he would

00:29:59.350 --> 00:30:01.900 align:middle line:90%
remember being taken upwards.

00:30:01.900 --> 00:30:05.000 align:middle line:90%
And then he would see lights.

00:30:05.000 --> 00:30:07.100 align:middle line:84%
And then he said
he couldn't always

00:30:07.100 --> 00:30:09.090 align:middle line:90%
remember how he got there.

00:30:09.090 --> 00:30:11.070 align:middle line:84%
But he said he would
have recollection

00:30:11.070 --> 00:30:14.690 align:middle line:84%
of being in a room,
like a round room.

00:30:14.690 --> 00:30:18.010 align:middle line:84%
He said he was onto something
very, very cold and very high.

00:30:18.010 --> 00:30:22.830 align:middle line:84%
He said it was like--
almost like a slab.

00:30:22.830 --> 00:30:24.980 align:middle line:84%
But he said there
were no corners.

00:30:24.980 --> 00:30:26.950 align:middle line:90%
Everything was rounded off.

00:30:26.950 --> 00:30:29.410 align:middle line:90%
There was no corners anywhere.

00:30:29.410 --> 00:30:31.920 align:middle line:84%
And he said it was
extremely well-lit,

00:30:31.920 --> 00:30:35.960 align:middle line:84%
but he said you couldn't see
where the light's coming from.

00:30:35.960 --> 00:30:38.700 align:middle line:84%
And he said that
there were usually

00:30:38.700 --> 00:30:40.410 align:middle line:90%
lots of the little ones about.

00:30:40.410 --> 00:30:43.460 align:middle line:84%
He said they were-- He referred
to them as the workers.

00:30:43.460 --> 00:30:46.910 align:middle line:84%
He said they were sort of
here, there, and everywhere.

00:30:46.910 --> 00:30:48.900 align:middle line:84%
Then he said they were
like the taller beings.

00:30:48.900 --> 00:30:51.316 align:middle line:84%
He said there were always two
or three of the taller ones.

00:30:51.316 --> 00:30:54.390 align:middle line:90%


00:30:54.390 --> 00:30:57.920 align:middle line:84%
He said they used to
sort of do things.

00:30:57.920 --> 00:31:00.840 align:middle line:84%
They would sort of touch
me in places with things

00:31:00.840 --> 00:31:05.440 align:middle line:84%
and hurt me, which, he
said, always terrified me.

00:31:05.440 --> 00:31:08.610 align:middle line:90%


00:31:08.610 --> 00:31:11.420 align:middle line:84%
He said, I used to sort of
be returned the same way.

00:31:11.420 --> 00:31:12.170 align:middle line:90%
They were just--

00:31:12.170 --> 00:31:13.836 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Were there
other people there?

00:31:13.836 --> 00:31:17.640 align:middle line:84%
Did he only notice the other
beings and no other humans?

00:31:17.640 --> 00:31:21.150 align:middle line:84%
>>ANN: At that time, he didn't
mention any other people.

00:31:21.150 --> 00:31:24.135 align:middle line:90%
This was just him alone.

00:31:24.135 --> 00:31:25.760 align:middle line:84%
Truthfully, it wasn't
the sort of thing

00:31:25.760 --> 00:31:27.260 align:middle line:84%
that we thought to
ask at that time.

00:31:27.260 --> 00:31:30.460 align:middle line:84%
We just thought, we
need to help him.

00:31:30.460 --> 00:31:33.900 align:middle line:84%
It wasn't until sort of
later, once-- like I said,

00:31:33.900 --> 00:31:36.030 align:middle line:84%
things changed for
him from then on.

00:31:36.030 --> 00:31:41.570 align:middle line:84%
Once we believed him, it sort of
helped him cope with the fear.

00:31:41.570 --> 00:31:44.770 align:middle line:84%
And then once he was
able to conquer the fear,

00:31:44.770 --> 00:31:46.370 align:middle line:90%
he started to listen.

00:31:46.370 --> 00:31:48.730 align:middle line:90%
He started to learn.

00:31:48.730 --> 00:31:52.300 align:middle line:84%
And they were happy
to teach him things.

00:31:52.300 --> 00:31:54.640 align:middle line:84%
And that's when he
started sort of realizing

00:31:54.640 --> 00:31:55.940 align:middle line:90%
that there were other people.

00:31:55.940 --> 00:31:59.045 align:middle line:90%


00:31:59.045 --> 00:32:01.930 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Now,
somewhere along the way,

00:32:01.930 --> 00:32:04.690 align:middle line:84%
something was jogged
in you about some

00:32:04.690 --> 00:32:06.350 align:middle line:90%
of your own past memories.

00:32:06.350 --> 00:32:06.980 align:middle line:90%
>>ANN: Yes.

00:32:06.980 --> 00:32:09.410 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So if you can talk
about that a little bit,

00:32:09.410 --> 00:32:11.890 align:middle line:84%
so we can start seeing
a bit of-- a lineage

00:32:11.890 --> 00:32:12.755 align:middle line:90%
to this whole thing.

00:32:12.755 --> 00:32:13.765 align:middle line:90%
>>ANN: Yeah, of course.

00:32:13.765 --> 00:32:16.285 align:middle line:90%


00:32:16.285 --> 00:32:20.860 align:middle line:10%
I suppose my-- I suppose one
of the memories that I had,

00:32:20.860 --> 00:32:25.770 align:middle line:10%
which I've always held on to,
which absolutely terrified me,

00:32:25.770 --> 00:32:29.180 align:middle line:10%
was when I was a child, because
we used to live in London.

00:32:29.180 --> 00:32:32.340 align:middle line:84%
My dad was working
nights, so I was

00:32:32.340 --> 00:32:35.330 align:middle line:90%
able to get into my mum's bed.

00:32:35.330 --> 00:32:38.030 align:middle line:84%
The dog was asleep at
the bottom of the bed.

00:32:38.030 --> 00:32:40.910 align:middle line:84%
And you know when you get that
feeling-- you just can't sleep,

00:32:40.910 --> 00:32:44.560 align:middle line:84%
but you get that feeling
that there's somebody there.

00:32:44.560 --> 00:32:46.390 align:middle line:84%
And I was only about
eight, I think.

00:32:46.390 --> 00:32:49.110 align:middle line:84%
And I remember suddenly
getting this feeling.

00:32:49.110 --> 00:32:52.720 align:middle line:84%
And I'm trying to wake my
mom, and she wouldn't wake.

00:32:52.720 --> 00:32:54.640 align:middle line:90%
The dog wouldn't wake.

00:32:54.640 --> 00:32:56.910 align:middle line:84%
And then I sort
of-- you know, you

00:32:56.910 --> 00:32:59.750 align:middle line:90%
peep out over the big clothes.

00:32:59.750 --> 00:33:03.860 align:middle line:84%
And there was this--
I call him a monk.

00:33:03.860 --> 00:33:05.610 align:middle line:84%
For years, I called
him a monk, because it

00:33:05.610 --> 00:33:11.590 align:middle line:84%
was like a hooded figure
with the big cowl thing.

00:33:11.590 --> 00:33:15.100 align:middle line:84%
And then it moved sort of
slowly, but it didn't walk.

00:33:15.100 --> 00:33:19.160 align:middle line:84%
But it glided around
the side of the bed.

00:33:19.160 --> 00:33:21.383 align:middle line:84%
And you know, I
remember, again, sort

00:33:21.383 --> 00:33:23.390 align:middle line:90%
of being absolutely petrified.

00:33:23.390 --> 00:33:25.370 align:middle line:84%
And then suddenly,
I couldn't move,

00:33:25.370 --> 00:33:27.510 align:middle line:90%
but I could see everything.

00:33:27.510 --> 00:33:29.110 align:middle line:84%
And then I saw these
hands to come up

00:33:29.110 --> 00:33:32.340 align:middle line:84%
to the hood to
push the hood back.

00:33:32.340 --> 00:33:35.240 align:middle line:84%
And that was the only
thing I could remember.

00:33:35.240 --> 00:33:38.747 align:middle line:84%
And that stayed with
me right up-- well,

00:33:38.747 --> 00:33:39.830 align:middle line:90%
it stayed with me forever.

00:33:39.830 --> 00:33:42.020 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Did your memory
go blank after that?

00:33:42.020 --> 00:33:44.160 align:middle line:84%
>>ANN: After that, I
couldn't remember a thing.

00:33:44.160 --> 00:33:46.780 align:middle line:84%
All I remember were these
sort of very long fingers,

00:33:46.780 --> 00:33:50.580 align:middle line:84%
very sort of wrinkled, very
old hands going up to the hood,

00:33:50.580 --> 00:33:52.010 align:middle line:90%
obviously, to push it back.

00:33:52.010 --> 00:33:52.620 align:middle line:90%
But then--

00:33:52.620 --> 00:33:53.660 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: That was it.

00:33:53.660 --> 00:33:54.451 align:middle line:90%
>>ANN: That was it.

00:33:54.451 --> 00:33:56.850 align:middle line:90%
That was all I could remember.

00:33:56.850 --> 00:34:00.630 align:middle line:84%
And it wasn't until Jason
was having his experiences

00:34:00.630 --> 00:34:04.720 align:middle line:84%
that I, for some
reason, I started

00:34:04.720 --> 00:34:06.830 align:middle line:90%
having dreams about that time.

00:34:06.830 --> 00:34:09.929 align:middle line:84%
Because it's something that,
no matter how hard I tried,

00:34:09.929 --> 00:34:12.050 align:middle line:84%
I couldn't put it to
the back of my mind.

00:34:12.050 --> 00:34:15.210 align:middle line:90%
I couldn't forget it.

00:34:15.210 --> 00:34:19.659 align:middle line:84%
You know when you know
something is real, it happens.

00:34:19.659 --> 00:34:22.230 align:middle line:84%
Everybody says to you, oh, you
imagined it, oh, it's a dream.

00:34:22.230 --> 00:34:24.400 align:middle line:84%
I mean, my mom said, oh, you
had a bad dream, darling.

00:34:24.400 --> 00:34:25.170 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: No, it's too visceral.

00:34:25.170 --> 00:34:25.940 align:middle line:90%
You can feel it.

00:34:25.940 --> 00:34:27.699 align:middle line:90%
>>ANN: Yeah, exactly.

00:34:27.699 --> 00:34:31.090 align:middle line:84%
So, I mean, I suppose I could
understand how Jason felt

00:34:31.090 --> 00:34:33.155 align:middle line:84%
at that point, because
I was angry at my mum

00:34:33.155 --> 00:34:34.030 align:middle line:90%
for not believing me.

00:34:34.030 --> 00:34:37.380 align:middle line:90%


00:34:37.380 --> 00:34:40.080 align:middle line:84%
But no, as I say, I never
got over that memory.

00:34:40.080 --> 00:34:43.159 align:middle line:84%
And it wasn't till he was having
his experiences that I finally

00:34:43.159 --> 00:34:49.190 align:middle line:84%
remembered the rest of it,
which was pushing the hood back.

00:34:49.190 --> 00:34:51.800 align:middle line:90%
I could see the face.

00:34:51.800 --> 00:34:56.290 align:middle line:10%
And I remember sort of thinking,
it looks as old as the planet,

00:34:56.290 --> 00:34:56.949 align:middle line:10%
basically.

00:34:56.949 --> 00:35:00.200 align:middle line:84%
It was that feel
that you got from it.

00:35:00.200 --> 00:35:03.050 align:middle line:84%
It was just thousands upon
thousands of years old.

00:35:03.050 --> 00:35:04.890 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Yeah,
it's interesting.

00:35:04.890 --> 00:35:07.760 align:middle line:84%
Many years ago when I first
started meditating and first

00:35:07.760 --> 00:35:10.440 align:middle line:84%
started going into just
kind of a soft altered state

00:35:10.440 --> 00:35:15.950 align:middle line:84%
of consciousness, the very
first things I encountered

00:35:15.950 --> 00:35:19.350 align:middle line:84%
were beings with those
eyes and faces that

00:35:19.350 --> 00:35:22.120 align:middle line:84%
would just phase
in and stare at me.

00:35:22.120 --> 00:35:25.800 align:middle line:84%
And I remember thinking,
my god, how old

00:35:25.800 --> 00:35:30.480 align:middle line:84%
must this being be, with these
wrinkly-- they were brown eyes,

00:35:30.480 --> 00:35:34.370 align:middle line:84%
but the skin was so
wrinkly around the eyes.

00:35:34.370 --> 00:35:36.310 align:middle line:84%
And it would just
stare at me and blink

00:35:36.310 --> 00:35:37.857 align:middle line:90%
and then back off and go away.

00:35:37.857 --> 00:35:38.690 align:middle line:90%
>>ANN: And fade off.

00:35:38.690 --> 00:35:39.015 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:35:39.015 --> 00:35:39.770 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:35:39.770 --> 00:35:43.020 align:middle line:84%
So-- and at the time, I
thought, I'm not making that up.

00:35:43.020 --> 00:35:45.720 align:middle line:84%
I'm looking at that, because
it happened repeatedly.

00:35:45.720 --> 00:35:49.060 align:middle line:84%
And I've always wondered what
it was that was-- I mean,

00:35:49.060 --> 00:35:52.010 align:middle line:84%
I have theories now many years
later with all this research.

00:35:52.010 --> 00:35:56.490 align:middle line:84%
But just kind of watching
and seeing what was going on.

00:35:56.490 --> 00:35:58.530 align:middle line:90%
And so-- now, OK.

00:35:58.530 --> 00:36:02.890 align:middle line:84%
So you started remembering
that or having dreams about it

00:36:02.890 --> 00:36:05.390 align:middle line:84%
before you came to
this reconciliation

00:36:05.390 --> 00:36:08.350 align:middle line:84%
with Jason, that I get it,
what's happening is real?

00:36:08.350 --> 00:36:10.860 align:middle line:84%
>>ANN: No, that
was after we-- yes,

00:36:10.860 --> 00:36:13.980 align:middle line:84%
that was after the
hypnosis TV thing.

00:36:13.980 --> 00:36:14.480 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

00:36:14.480 --> 00:36:15.482 align:middle line:90%
That was after that.

00:36:15.482 --> 00:36:16.940 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Now, your
mother had told

00:36:16.940 --> 00:36:19.350 align:middle line:90%
you something about your father.

00:36:19.350 --> 00:36:22.020 align:middle line:84%
There was something revealed
about your father then, right?

00:36:22.020 --> 00:36:22.840 align:middle line:90%
>>ANN: That's correct, yes.

00:36:22.840 --> 00:36:24.298 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So let's
talk about that.

00:36:24.298 --> 00:36:26.940 align:middle line:90%
>>ANN: Yeah.

00:36:26.940 --> 00:36:29.550 align:middle line:84%
Obviously, you talk to
your mum about things.

00:36:29.550 --> 00:36:30.960 align:middle line:84%
And I was telling
her how worried

00:36:30.960 --> 00:36:33.830 align:middle line:90%
we were about Jason at the time.

00:36:33.830 --> 00:36:37.963 align:middle line:84%
And she just said, well,
your dad used to go off.

00:36:37.963 --> 00:36:41.040 align:middle line:90%
And I was like, what? [LAUGHS]

00:36:41.040 --> 00:36:44.480 align:middle line:84%
And she said, yeah, I didn't
really think anything of it

00:36:44.480 --> 00:36:45.291 align:middle line:90%
at the time.

00:36:45.291 --> 00:36:45.790 align:middle line:90%
She said--

00:36:45.790 --> 00:36:47.670 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Your dad
used to go off.

00:36:47.670 --> 00:36:48.311 align:middle line:90%
>>ANN: Go off.

00:36:48.311 --> 00:36:48.810 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:36:48.810 --> 00:36:49.360 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: So OK.

00:36:49.360 --> 00:36:51.600 align:middle line:84%
Did you get a better
explanation than that from her?

00:36:51.600 --> 00:36:52.308 align:middle line:90%
>>ANN: Oh, I did.

00:36:52.308 --> 00:36:53.580 align:middle line:90%
Yes, I did.

00:36:53.580 --> 00:36:57.157 align:middle line:84%
She said, well, I would wake
up, and he wouldn't be there.

00:36:57.157 --> 00:36:58.240 align:middle line:90%
He just wouldn't be there.

00:36:58.240 --> 00:36:59.740 align:middle line:84%
She said, he wouldn't
be in the bed,

00:36:59.740 --> 00:37:01.670 align:middle line:90%
he wouldn't be in the house.

00:37:01.670 --> 00:37:04.710 align:middle line:84%
And she said, I
couldn't work it out.

00:37:04.710 --> 00:37:07.515 align:middle line:84%
She said, then in the morning,
she said, for some reason,

00:37:07.515 --> 00:37:09.725 align:middle line:84%
I would go back to sleep
and not worry about it,

00:37:09.725 --> 00:37:11.540 align:middle line:84%
she said, although it
was odd, because you

00:37:11.540 --> 00:37:13.650 align:middle line:90%
would worry about it.

00:37:13.650 --> 00:37:15.195 align:middle line:84%
But she said, I
always remember sort

00:37:15.195 --> 00:37:18.050 align:middle line:84%
of waking up in the
morning, and he'd be there.

00:37:18.050 --> 00:37:21.500 align:middle line:84%
She said, and I'd
just say to him,

00:37:21.500 --> 00:37:23.180 align:middle line:84%
did you go anywhere
in the night?

00:37:23.180 --> 00:37:24.870 align:middle line:84%
And she said he'd
just look at me

00:37:24.870 --> 00:37:27.760 align:middle line:84%
and chuckle and say, oh,
wouldn't you like to know.

00:37:27.760 --> 00:37:28.600 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHS]

00:37:28.600 --> 00:37:29.590 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: That was it?

00:37:29.590 --> 00:37:31.490 align:middle line:84%
And so he never did tell
her what he'd been through?

00:37:31.490 --> 00:37:32.595 align:middle line:90%
>>ANN: No, no, he didn't.

00:37:32.595 --> 00:37:36.250 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: It's like all of
the secrecy, so to speak.

00:37:36.250 --> 00:37:37.000 align:middle line:90%
It's interesting.

00:37:37.000 --> 00:37:39.610 align:middle line:84%
Here, this is a
multi-generational experience,

00:37:39.610 --> 00:37:40.390 align:middle line:90%
obviously.

00:37:40.390 --> 00:37:44.450 align:middle line:84%
Your family had been
selected or maybe

00:37:44.450 --> 00:37:48.580 align:middle line:84%
on some very unknown
subconscious level, even maybe

00:37:48.580 --> 00:37:50.380 align:middle line:90%
agreed to be part of something.

00:37:50.380 --> 00:37:52.000 align:middle line:90%
Who knows how that works, right?

00:37:52.000 --> 00:37:52.980 align:middle line:90%
>>ANN: Exactly.

00:37:52.980 --> 00:37:53.570 align:middle line:90%
Exactly.

00:37:53.570 --> 00:37:55.420 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And so did
you ever find out

00:37:55.420 --> 00:37:57.490 align:middle line:90%
what your dad had been through?

00:37:57.490 --> 00:37:59.870 align:middle line:84%
>>ANN: He did mention
to me once when

00:37:59.870 --> 00:38:01.570 align:middle line:90%
we were out walking the dog.

00:38:01.570 --> 00:38:05.590 align:middle line:84%
He did say to me-- I think
we were talking about things

00:38:05.590 --> 00:38:08.700 align:middle line:84%
in general, how beautiful
the park was, et cetera.

00:38:08.700 --> 00:38:11.600 align:middle line:84%
And he did say to me,
you know, he said,

00:38:11.600 --> 00:38:14.040 align:middle line:84%
something will
probably happen to you

00:38:14.040 --> 00:38:17.890 align:middle line:84%
as you get older,
he said, which you

00:38:17.890 --> 00:38:21.450 align:middle line:90%
won't be able to understand.

00:38:21.450 --> 00:38:24.280 align:middle line:90%
He said, you'll be taken places.

00:38:24.280 --> 00:38:27.190 align:middle line:84%
But he said, please don't
be frightened of it.

00:38:27.190 --> 00:38:29.340 align:middle line:84%
He said, it can be
a beautiful thing.

00:38:29.340 --> 00:38:30.310 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Interesting.

00:38:30.310 --> 00:38:32.059 align:middle line:84%
How old were you when
he said that to you?

00:38:32.059 --> 00:38:35.090 align:middle line:84%
>>ANN: I suppose I was
about, again, eight or nine.

00:38:35.090 --> 00:38:36.090 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Eight or nine.

00:38:36.090 --> 00:38:38.506 align:middle line:84%
And then one time you were
walking down the street holding

00:38:38.506 --> 00:38:40.250 align:middle line:90%
his hand, and there was a trio?

00:38:40.250 --> 00:38:41.440 align:middle line:90%
>>ANN: That's correct.

00:38:41.440 --> 00:38:41.960 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

00:38:41.960 --> 00:38:44.610 align:middle line:84%
We were actually in
the park and, again,

00:38:44.610 --> 00:38:48.180 align:middle line:84%
walking through the parking,
enjoying the sunshine.

00:38:48.180 --> 00:38:52.349 align:middle line:84%
And suddenly, there were these
three people in front of him.

00:38:52.349 --> 00:38:53.890 align:middle line:84%
When I first saw
them, they were just

00:38:53.890 --> 00:38:57.270 align:middle line:84%
dressed just as we
are, just normally.

00:38:57.270 --> 00:38:59.030 align:middle line:84%
And again, I sort
of looked at them

00:38:59.030 --> 00:39:01.080 align:middle line:84%
and remember thinking,
oh, they must

00:39:01.080 --> 00:39:04.130 align:middle line:84%
be so lucky to-- because
again, they were tanned skin.

00:39:04.130 --> 00:39:06.800 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Do I take it
they had blue eyes also?

00:39:06.800 --> 00:39:08.030 align:middle line:90%
>>ANN: They did, yes.

00:39:08.030 --> 00:39:11.970 align:middle line:84%
And they were very,
very tall to my dad.

00:39:11.970 --> 00:39:15.150 align:middle line:84%
And as a child, I remember
thinking, oh, they

00:39:15.150 --> 00:39:16.720 align:middle line:84%
must be really
rich, because they

00:39:16.720 --> 00:39:18.510 align:middle line:84%
can afford to go
abroad for holidays,

00:39:18.510 --> 00:39:21.890 align:middle line:84%
because, obviously, the dark,
you know, the tanned skin.

00:39:21.890 --> 00:39:26.130 align:middle line:84%
And it was like suddenly my
dad was pushing me behind him.

00:39:26.130 --> 00:39:27.390 align:middle line:90%
And that's when I started--

00:39:27.390 --> 00:39:28.380 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Interesting.

00:39:28.380 --> 00:39:30.740 align:middle line:84%
>>ANN: --getting a
little bit scared.

00:39:30.740 --> 00:39:34.070 align:middle line:84%
But it was obvious that he knew
them and he knew them well.

00:39:34.070 --> 00:39:36.260 align:middle line:84%
And then the next
recollection I have

00:39:36.260 --> 00:39:38.900 align:middle line:84%
was I couldn't smell
the grass anymore,

00:39:38.900 --> 00:39:40.330 align:middle line:90%
and the sun wasn't shining.

00:39:40.330 --> 00:39:43.530 align:middle line:84%
But we were in, like,
a huge corridor.

00:39:43.530 --> 00:39:47.180 align:middle line:84%
And I was like, how
did we get here?

00:39:47.180 --> 00:39:51.140 align:middle line:84%
I still, to this day, don't
know how we got there.

00:39:51.140 --> 00:39:54.650 align:middle line:84%
But my dad was with me,
and I was holding his hand.

00:39:54.650 --> 00:39:58.970 align:middle line:84%
And then the being
that-- or the person

00:39:58.970 --> 00:40:04.400 align:middle line:84%
that we'd seen in the park,
he held out his hand to me.

00:40:04.400 --> 00:40:06.120 align:middle line:90%
And I looked at my dad.

00:40:06.120 --> 00:40:09.720 align:middle line:84%
My dad just went, it's
OK, take his hand.

00:40:09.720 --> 00:40:11.625 align:middle line:84%
So I took his hand
very reluctantly.

00:40:11.625 --> 00:40:13.870 align:middle line:84%
And he was leading
me away from my dad.

00:40:13.870 --> 00:40:15.080 align:middle line:90%
And my dad was just looking.

00:40:15.080 --> 00:40:17.150 align:middle line:84%
And I'm thinking,
why is he doing this?

00:40:17.150 --> 00:40:19.870 align:middle line:84%
Because he's always telling me,
you don't talk to strangers,

00:40:19.870 --> 00:40:21.139 align:middle line:90%
you don't go with strangers.

00:40:21.139 --> 00:40:21.805 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:40:21.805 --> 00:40:22.305 align:middle line:90%
Right.

00:40:22.305 --> 00:40:25.050 align:middle line:84%
>>ANN: It was against
everything that he'd told me.

00:40:25.050 --> 00:40:27.695 align:middle line:84%
So that was very,
very confusing.

00:40:27.695 --> 00:40:33.190 align:middle line:84%
But this-- this-- this
person, shall I say,

00:40:33.190 --> 00:40:35.700 align:middle line:90%
he took me into this room.

00:40:35.700 --> 00:40:36.880 align:middle line:90%
It was a very noisy room.

00:40:36.880 --> 00:40:39.540 align:middle line:84%
And there were dozens of
other children in there.

00:40:39.540 --> 00:40:42.740 align:middle line:84%
And they were all
playing with things.

00:40:42.740 --> 00:40:47.575 align:middle line:84%
And it was like I suddenly
recognized this boy.

00:40:47.575 --> 00:40:50.900 align:middle line:84%
And I sort of let go of his
hand and immediately ran over

00:40:50.900 --> 00:40:52.330 align:middle line:90%
to him.

00:40:52.330 --> 00:40:55.125 align:middle line:90%
And we started playing together.

00:40:55.125 --> 00:40:56.625 align:middle line:84%
And I don't know
where he came from.

00:40:56.625 --> 00:40:57.874 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: After that, it just?

00:40:57.874 --> 00:40:59.680 align:middle line:84%
>>ANN: After that, it
just seemed natural.

00:40:59.680 --> 00:41:02.380 align:middle line:90%
And I was just playing there.

00:41:02.380 --> 00:41:06.440 align:middle line:84%
And the tall being came to
collect me after a while,

00:41:06.440 --> 00:41:07.620 align:middle line:90%
took me back to my dad.

00:41:07.620 --> 00:41:10.250 align:middle line:84%
And then we were
back in the park.

00:41:10.250 --> 00:41:12.371 align:middle line:84%
And it was sort of
a few hours later.

00:41:12.371 --> 00:41:14.620 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Now, at some point,
there were some messages

00:41:14.620 --> 00:41:17.515 align:middle line:84%
that you were given,
some key messages?

00:41:17.515 --> 00:41:19.897 align:middle line:84%
>>ANN: No, I said Jason
was more the one that was--

00:41:19.897 --> 00:41:20.730 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Jason was.

00:41:20.730 --> 00:41:21.420 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:41:21.420 --> 00:41:23.340 align:middle line:84%
And what were the
messages that were

00:41:23.340 --> 00:41:25.620 align:middle line:90%
coming to Jason at that point?

00:41:25.620 --> 00:41:27.870 align:middle line:84%
>>ANN: Well, it was things
that they were telling him,

00:41:27.870 --> 00:41:30.850 align:middle line:84%
things that they were
giving him, telling him

00:41:30.850 --> 00:41:35.470 align:middle line:84%
that he was to be part of
the future for the planet,

00:41:35.470 --> 00:41:39.550 align:middle line:84%
to be instrumental
in helping mankind

00:41:39.550 --> 00:41:45.420 align:middle line:90%
to attain-- how did they put it?

00:41:45.420 --> 00:41:48.110 align:middle line:10%
He said, out there is
no different down here.

00:41:48.110 --> 00:41:50.800 align:middle line:84%
He said, you get the
good, you get the bad.

00:41:50.800 --> 00:41:53.460 align:middle line:84%
He said, there's always
got to be a balance.

00:41:53.460 --> 00:41:58.220 align:middle line:84%
But he said this planet is
basically destroying itself.

00:41:58.220 --> 00:42:04.850 align:middle line:84%
And he sort of gave messages
from them, saying that how much

00:42:04.850 --> 00:42:08.600 align:middle line:84%
longer could we keep going,
given all the natural disasters

00:42:08.600 --> 00:42:11.530 align:middle line:84%
which go on, all
the wars, et cetera.

00:42:11.530 --> 00:42:14.250 align:middle line:84%
And that pretty
soon, we would have

00:42:14.250 --> 00:42:18.870 align:middle line:84%
no choice but to either
change or be eliminated.

00:42:18.870 --> 00:42:21.680 align:middle line:10%
He also told us that this
was about the seventh time

00:42:21.680 --> 00:42:26.120 align:middle line:10%
that the planet had been
created and that each time,

00:42:26.120 --> 00:42:28.920 align:middle line:10%
it was mankind that
had destroyed it.

00:42:28.920 --> 00:42:30.640 align:middle line:84%
So they were obviously
more in depth,

00:42:30.640 --> 00:42:33.250 align:middle line:84%
but they were very,
very cryptic messages.

00:42:33.250 --> 00:42:36.230 align:middle line:10%
But he was very
sincere about them all.

00:42:36.230 --> 00:42:40.930 align:middle line:84%
And he told us that he was here
as part of the rescue party,

00:42:40.930 --> 00:42:44.535 align:middle line:84%
if you like-- him and,
obviously, thousands of others.

00:42:44.535 --> 00:42:47.070 align:middle line:90%
Thousands of star children.

00:42:47.070 --> 00:42:49.120 align:middle line:84%
Or some people
call them indigoes

00:42:49.120 --> 00:42:52.360 align:middle line:84%
because of the
color of their aura.

00:42:52.360 --> 00:42:54.630 align:middle line:84%
And he said that
they were all here

00:42:54.630 --> 00:42:58.946 align:middle line:84%
to help with the
adjustment, as he put it.

00:42:58.946 --> 00:43:01.290 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: At some point,
he was able to relay

00:43:01.290 --> 00:43:04.180 align:middle line:84%
to you the circumstances
surrounding his birth,

00:43:04.180 --> 00:43:05.220 align:middle line:90%
as I recall, yes?

00:43:05.220 --> 00:43:06.190 align:middle line:90%
>>ANN: Yes, he was.

00:43:06.190 --> 00:43:06.731 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: OK.

00:43:06.731 --> 00:43:09.065 align:middle line:84%
Let's talk about what actually
happened at his birth.

00:43:09.065 --> 00:43:09.680 align:middle line:90%
>>ANN: Right.

00:43:09.680 --> 00:43:11.700 align:middle line:84%
That was his 18th
birthday party.

00:43:11.700 --> 00:43:13.120 align:middle line:10%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:43:13.120 --> 00:43:16.455 align:middle line:84%
Did he have another wonderfully
exciting birthday party?

00:43:16.455 --> 00:43:17.285 align:middle line:90%
>>ANN: Well, no.

00:43:17.285 --> 00:43:18.870 align:middle line:90%
It was very normal.

00:43:18.870 --> 00:43:22.960 align:middle line:84%
It was his first pint of
lager, so he was over the moon.

00:43:22.960 --> 00:43:24.690 align:middle line:84%
But as we were getting
everything ready,

00:43:24.690 --> 00:43:27.670 align:middle line:84%
he came into the kitchen and
he said to us, oh, Mum, Fad,

00:43:27.670 --> 00:43:28.939 align:middle line:90%
can you sit down for a minute?

00:43:28.939 --> 00:43:30.230 align:middle line:90%
He said, I want to talk to you.

00:43:30.230 --> 00:43:31.880 align:middle line:90%
I'll make you a cup of tea.

00:43:31.880 --> 00:43:33.570 align:middle line:84%
And we thought,
wow, he's actually

00:43:33.570 --> 00:43:35.494 align:middle line:84%
offering to make
us a cup of tea.

00:43:35.494 --> 00:43:36.035 align:middle line:90%
Do something?

00:43:36.035 --> 00:43:37.030 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Make a cup of--
this must be serious.

00:43:37.030 --> 00:43:37.560 align:middle line:90%
>>ANN: Yeah.

00:43:37.560 --> 00:43:38.230 align:middle line:90%
Well, exactly.

00:43:38.230 --> 00:43:40.800 align:middle line:84%
We thought, it's
got to be serious.

00:43:40.800 --> 00:43:42.290 align:middle line:84%
And he came over
and he sat down.

00:43:42.290 --> 00:43:45.400 align:middle line:84%
And he said, when
I was born, do you

00:43:45.400 --> 00:43:48.450 align:middle line:84%
remember them taking
away that fetal monitor?

00:43:48.450 --> 00:43:52.840 align:middle line:84%
And I was like, obviously,
we'd never mentioned it to him.

00:43:52.840 --> 00:43:54.610 align:middle line:90%
Why would you?

00:43:54.610 --> 00:43:56.680 align:middle line:84%
And I said, well, how
did you know about that?

00:43:56.680 --> 00:44:00.400 align:middle line:84%
And he said, well,
just bear with me.

00:44:00.400 --> 00:44:03.090 align:middle line:84%
He said, there was
nothing wrong with it.

00:44:03.090 --> 00:44:04.830 align:middle line:10%
And I said, well,
what are you saying?

00:44:04.830 --> 00:44:07.821 align:middle line:84%
And he said, I'm saying to
you that your baby did die.

00:44:07.821 --> 00:44:09.820 align:middle line:84%
And I said, Jason, that's
an awful thing to say.

00:44:09.820 --> 00:44:10.350 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Ugh.

00:44:10.350 --> 00:44:11.100 align:middle line:90%
Chills in my hair.

00:44:11.100 --> 00:44:11.650 align:middle line:90%
>>ANN: Yeah.

00:44:11.650 --> 00:44:13.140 align:middle line:90%
That is awful.

00:44:13.140 --> 00:44:16.640 align:middle line:84%
And he said, no, he said,
there were many, many hundreds

00:44:16.640 --> 00:44:19.740 align:middle line:84%
of women who have
stillborn children.

00:44:19.740 --> 00:44:22.400 align:middle line:90%
He said, it's a fact of life.

00:44:22.400 --> 00:44:26.830 align:middle line:84%
But, he said, I was waiting,
he said, because, he said,

00:44:26.830 --> 00:44:30.890 align:middle line:84%
I had the opportunity
to be human again.

00:44:30.890 --> 00:44:34.090 align:middle line:84%
And he said, I was
waiting until that soul

00:44:34.090 --> 00:44:38.270 align:middle line:84%
had left of its own accord,
of its own free will, he said,

00:44:38.270 --> 00:44:40.790 align:middle line:84%
because, he said, it
wasn't until that point

00:44:40.790 --> 00:44:47.009 align:middle line:84%
that I was allowed
to occupy that body.

00:44:47.009 --> 00:44:48.800 align:middle line:84%
He said, you'll no
doubt remember, he said,

00:44:48.800 --> 00:44:52.150 align:middle line:84%
that when I was born, he said,
I was quite healthy and loud

00:44:52.150 --> 00:44:57.600 align:middle line:84%
and, you know, haven't changed
much since, which is the truth.

00:44:57.600 --> 00:45:00.080 align:middle line:84%
And as I said, I swear
that nobody had ever

00:45:00.080 --> 00:45:01.940 align:middle line:90%
told him any of that.

00:45:01.940 --> 00:45:05.090 align:middle line:84%
And he said that
he is a walk-in.

00:45:05.090 --> 00:45:07.460 align:middle line:84%
He walked into the
body that was vacated

00:45:07.460 --> 00:45:11.680 align:middle line:84%
because that's what
he chose to do.

00:45:11.680 --> 00:45:13.970 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Did he go on
any further about, again,

00:45:13.970 --> 00:45:17.180 align:middle line:84%
why he had chosen to do that
and chosen this life and body?

00:45:17.180 --> 00:45:17.990 align:middle line:90%
>>ANN: Yeah.

00:45:17.990 --> 00:45:22.990 align:middle line:84%
He did say that he'd incarnated
into many different lives

00:45:22.990 --> 00:45:27.180 align:middle line:84%
before, some of them on this
planet, many of them on others.

00:45:27.180 --> 00:45:29.720 align:middle line:84%
But he said that he
wanted to experience

00:45:29.720 --> 00:45:33.917 align:middle line:84%
what it was like to grow up as
a human, to be human, he said,

00:45:33.917 --> 00:45:35.750 align:middle line:84%
because, he said, I
thought it would give me

00:45:35.750 --> 00:45:39.270 align:middle line:84%
more of an understanding
of where you're coming

00:45:39.270 --> 00:45:43.255 align:middle line:84%
from and in helping you
when the time comes.

00:45:43.255 --> 00:45:44.140 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Wow.

00:45:44.140 --> 00:45:46.860 align:middle line:84%
What a thing to be told by
your son over a cup of tea.

00:45:46.860 --> 00:45:50.230 align:middle line:84%
What happened to you and your
husband, Paul, at this point?

00:45:50.230 --> 00:45:52.540 align:middle line:84%
>>ANN: Truthfully,
after everything

00:45:52.540 --> 00:45:55.660 align:middle line:84%
that we'd experienced
from, as I said,

00:45:55.660 --> 00:45:58.810 align:middle line:84%
since the day we said,
"we believe you," I mean,

00:45:58.810 --> 00:46:01.730 align:middle line:84%
since that day, things
really stepped up.

00:46:01.730 --> 00:46:05.000 align:middle line:84%
So of course, we were
having our own experiences.

00:46:05.000 --> 00:46:08.790 align:middle line:84%
We were experiencing
things in the house.

00:46:08.790 --> 00:46:11.090 align:middle line:84%
And so I mean, to
us, at that point,

00:46:11.090 --> 00:46:13.543 align:middle line:90%
it was just like, oh, OK.

00:46:13.543 --> 00:46:14.212 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:46:14.212 --> 00:46:15.295 align:middle line:90%
Just part of your reality.

00:46:15.295 --> 00:46:17.865 align:middle line:84%
>>ANN: Just part of
our reality, really.

00:46:17.865 --> 00:46:19.680 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Was there
any kind of DNA

00:46:19.680 --> 00:46:22.015 align:middle line:90%
that was tested regarding Jason?

00:46:22.015 --> 00:46:22.962 align:middle line:90%
>>ANN: No.

00:46:22.962 --> 00:46:23.920 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: As time went?

00:46:23.920 --> 00:46:26.130 align:middle line:84%
He was never looked at
on any level like that?

00:46:26.130 --> 00:46:26.630 align:middle line:90%
He was--

00:46:26.630 --> 00:46:27.640 align:middle line:90%
>>ANN: No, no.

00:46:27.640 --> 00:46:30.565 align:middle line:84%
So apart from the tests
he had when he was 12.

00:46:30.565 --> 00:46:32.240 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: OK.

00:46:32.240 --> 00:46:36.590 align:middle line:90%
There was a third child, right?

00:46:36.590 --> 00:46:37.382 align:middle line:90%
Well, yes, exactly.

00:46:37.382 --> 00:46:39.256 align:middle line:84%
>>ANN: We hoped there
was a third child, yes.

00:46:39.256 --> 00:46:39.930 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:46:39.930 --> 00:46:40.610 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:46:40.610 --> 00:46:41.110 align:middle line:90%
Nathan.

00:46:41.110 --> 00:46:41.800 align:middle line:90%
>>ANN: Yes.

00:46:41.800 --> 00:46:46.600 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Can you talk
about Nathan a little bit?

00:46:46.600 --> 00:46:49.980 align:middle line:84%
Tell us what happened and that
there was later an encounter

00:46:49.980 --> 00:46:51.840 align:middle line:90%
with the soul, the being.

00:46:51.840 --> 00:46:52.930 align:middle line:90%
>>ANN: Yes.

00:46:52.930 --> 00:46:56.075 align:middle line:84%
Basically, it didn't
go to full term.

00:46:56.075 --> 00:46:58.660 align:middle line:90%


00:46:58.660 --> 00:47:02.060 align:middle line:90%
Obviously, lost the baby.

00:47:02.060 --> 00:47:03.330 align:middle line:90%
It was never really mentioned.

00:47:03.330 --> 00:47:06.975 align:middle line:90%


00:47:06.975 --> 00:47:09.760 align:middle line:84%
But the thing was, I
had this-- the night

00:47:09.760 --> 00:47:12.470 align:middle line:84%
that it happened,
I had this really

00:47:12.470 --> 00:47:18.450 align:middle line:84%
sort of very vivid dream, which
I've assumed it was a dream.

00:47:18.450 --> 00:47:23.660 align:middle line:84%
I dreamt that I was on some
sort of table in a hospital.

00:47:23.660 --> 00:47:27.220 align:middle line:84%
And there was the blonde
being that I told you

00:47:27.220 --> 00:47:29.420 align:middle line:90%
about from the park.

00:47:29.420 --> 00:47:32.966 align:middle line:84%
And it was like I could just
about-- I knew it was him,

00:47:32.966 --> 00:47:35.590 align:middle line:84%
but I couldn't see him, because
it was like a light behind him.

00:47:35.590 --> 00:47:39.076 align:middle line:84%
So it sort of shadowed
him, if that makes sense.

00:47:39.076 --> 00:47:42.000 align:middle line:84%
But I remember I was
in incredible pain.

00:47:42.000 --> 00:47:43.970 align:middle line:84%
And he just sort of
touched my forehead.

00:47:43.970 --> 00:47:47.820 align:middle line:90%
And I just felt so peaceful.

00:47:47.820 --> 00:47:51.130 align:middle line:90%
It just felt so good.

00:47:51.130 --> 00:47:52.380 align:middle line:90%
And then I just looked at him.

00:47:52.380 --> 00:47:55.330 align:middle line:84%
And I said to him, why
are you taking my baby?

00:47:55.330 --> 00:47:58.470 align:middle line:90%


00:47:58.470 --> 00:48:03.710 align:middle line:84%
He said, it's for your own
good, because, he said,

00:48:03.710 --> 00:48:05.610 align:middle line:90%
you can't bear this child.

00:48:05.610 --> 00:48:08.590 align:middle line:90%
He said, it will kill you.

00:48:08.590 --> 00:48:10.540 align:middle line:84%
We were sort of
warned about the risks

00:48:10.540 --> 00:48:13.290 align:middle line:84%
of-- it was risky having
a third child because

00:48:13.290 --> 00:48:15.590 align:middle line:84%
of other problems,
which I won't go into.

00:48:15.590 --> 00:48:19.410 align:middle line:90%
But we were told it was a risk.

00:48:19.410 --> 00:48:22.220 align:middle line:84%
But it's like I woke
up in the morning,

00:48:22.220 --> 00:48:24.670 align:middle line:84%
obviously when
everything was finished.

00:48:24.670 --> 00:48:28.950 align:middle line:84%
And it's actually from
that point on I hated them.

00:48:28.950 --> 00:48:30.790 align:middle line:84%
And I hated them
with a vengeance.

00:48:30.790 --> 00:48:32.665 align:middle line:90%
It was like, how dare they?

00:48:32.665 --> 00:48:33.476 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:48:33.476 --> 00:48:34.600 align:middle line:90%
Make that decision for you.

00:48:34.600 --> 00:48:35.153 align:middle line:90%
>>ANN: Yeah.

00:48:35.153 --> 00:48:35.635 align:middle line:90%
How dare they?

00:48:35.635 --> 00:48:35.943 align:middle line:90%
Yeah, exactly.

00:48:35.943 --> 00:48:37.160 align:middle line:90%
That was for us to say.

00:48:37.160 --> 00:48:41.050 align:middle line:84%
That was for us to
make our minds up.

00:48:41.050 --> 00:48:43.990 align:middle line:84%
So I really did
really despise them.

00:48:43.990 --> 00:48:47.800 align:middle line:84%
And Jason said to me, you
know, because he obviously

00:48:47.800 --> 00:48:49.619 align:middle line:90%
knew all about it.

00:48:49.619 --> 00:48:51.910 align:middle line:84%
And he said to me, he said,
you know it wasn't a dream.

00:48:51.910 --> 00:48:53.200 align:middle line:90%
He said, you know it was real.

00:48:53.200 --> 00:48:56.680 align:middle line:84%
He said, mum, you
couldn't have that baby.

00:48:56.680 --> 00:49:00.940 align:middle line:84%
He said, it would have
killed you, and we need you.

00:49:00.940 --> 00:49:02.340 align:middle line:90%
But it didn't help.

00:49:02.340 --> 00:49:05.350 align:middle line:84%
You know, I still
felt the anger.

00:49:05.350 --> 00:49:08.150 align:middle line:84%
And it wasn't until
we actually went

00:49:08.150 --> 00:49:11.250 align:middle line:84%
to see some friends
in Australia-- well,

00:49:11.250 --> 00:49:12.900 align:middle line:90%
I say "friends."

00:49:12.900 --> 00:49:17.740 align:middle line:84%
We were invited to Australia
to give lectures and talks.

00:49:17.740 --> 00:49:20.190 align:middle line:84%
And there was a
lovely lady, who's

00:49:20.190 --> 00:49:22.185 align:middle line:84%
now a very good friend
of mine, Mary Rodwell.

00:49:22.185 --> 00:49:22.930 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:49:22.930 --> 00:49:25.013 align:middle line:84%
>>ANN: You've heard of--
yeah, I was going to say,

00:49:25.013 --> 00:49:26.920 align:middle line:90%
I'm sure you've heard of her.

00:49:26.920 --> 00:49:30.270 align:middle line:84%
She asked if she
could do a regression

00:49:30.270 --> 00:49:33.300 align:middle line:84%
to try and help me
to get over that.

00:49:33.300 --> 00:49:37.000 align:middle line:84%
And we arranged a day when Paul
could take both the boys out

00:49:37.000 --> 00:49:40.280 align:middle line:84%
somewhere, so we had
the house to ourselves.

00:49:40.280 --> 00:49:40.860 align:middle line:90%
And she did.

00:49:40.860 --> 00:49:42.750 align:middle line:90%
She took me back to that night.

00:49:42.750 --> 00:49:50.520 align:middle line:84%
And she took me back
to the blonde being.

00:49:50.520 --> 00:49:54.960 align:middle line:10%
And he sort of spoke
to me some more,

00:49:54.960 --> 00:49:58.190 align:middle line:10%
and he tried to
explain that they

00:49:58.190 --> 00:50:01.010 align:middle line:10%
wouldn't keep my son from me.

00:50:01.010 --> 00:50:05.500 align:middle line:84%
And then Mary said to me,
would you like to see him?

00:50:05.500 --> 00:50:07.880 align:middle line:84%
And I said-- I was
crying at that point,

00:50:07.880 --> 00:50:10.820 align:middle line:84%
and I said, yes,
I need to see him.

00:50:10.820 --> 00:50:13.020 align:middle line:84%
And he just sort of
seemed to sort of walk out

00:50:13.020 --> 00:50:14.290 align:middle line:90%
from behind her.

00:50:14.290 --> 00:50:16.530 align:middle line:84%
And he was only about
sort of six or seven.

00:50:16.530 --> 00:50:19.840 align:middle line:84%
He had a little tooth missing at
the front and great, big locks

00:50:19.840 --> 00:50:21.790 align:middle line:90%
of blonde hair.

00:50:21.790 --> 00:50:23.820 align:middle line:84%
And I remember looking
at him and saying,

00:50:23.820 --> 00:50:26.720 align:middle line:90%
oh, I think you need a haircut.

00:50:26.720 --> 00:50:29.040 align:middle line:84%
And he held out
this red rose to me,

00:50:29.040 --> 00:50:31.240 align:middle line:84%
because he knows red
roses are my thing.

00:50:31.240 --> 00:50:35.400 align:middle line:90%


00:50:35.400 --> 00:50:37.110 align:middle line:90%
I felt at ease.

00:50:37.110 --> 00:50:41.100 align:middle line:84%
I felt so much better,
because I had remembered more.

00:50:41.100 --> 00:50:44.080 align:middle line:84%
And I was at peace
with it, if you like.

00:50:44.080 --> 00:50:48.100 align:middle line:84%
I could understand why
they did what they did.

00:50:48.100 --> 00:50:50.400 align:middle line:84%
And it was quite
funny, actually,

00:50:50.400 --> 00:50:53.650 align:middle line:84%
because when Paul came back
with the boys a few hours later,

00:50:53.650 --> 00:50:58.080 align:middle line:84%
I was just sitting talking
to Mary about everything.

00:50:58.080 --> 00:50:59.630 align:middle line:90%
And Jason walked in.

00:50:59.630 --> 00:51:02.660 align:middle line:84%
And he said to me,
so why do you think

00:51:02.660 --> 00:51:04.210 align:middle line:84%
Nathan needs a
haircut then, mum?

00:51:04.210 --> 00:51:05.936 align:middle line:90%
He said, I think it suits him.

00:51:05.936 --> 00:51:06.550 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Oh.

00:51:06.550 --> 00:51:07.050 align:middle line:90%
Oh.

00:51:07.050 --> 00:51:11.180 align:middle line:84%
>>ANN: And I was like,
how the hell do you know?

00:51:11.180 --> 00:51:13.630 align:middle line:84%
And he just said,
he's my brother.

00:51:13.630 --> 00:51:16.100 align:middle line:84%
He said, I've been seeing
him since it happened.

00:51:16.100 --> 00:51:19.710 align:middle line:90%


00:51:19.710 --> 00:51:22.340 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Knowing
everything you knew by then,

00:51:22.340 --> 00:51:24.840 align:middle line:84%
how did your rapport
with your sons change?

00:51:24.840 --> 00:51:29.890 align:middle line:84%
Or were they still by and
large your sons, kids, people?

00:51:29.890 --> 00:51:31.385 align:middle line:90%
Or were they totally different?

00:51:31.385 --> 00:51:32.140 align:middle line:90%
>>ANN: No.

00:51:32.140 --> 00:51:32.640 align:middle line:90%
No.

00:51:32.640 --> 00:51:36.044 align:middle line:84%
I love my boys with
every inch of me.

00:51:36.044 --> 00:51:36.710 align:middle line:90%
They're my boys.

00:51:36.710 --> 00:51:39.126 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: But I mean, did you
look at them any differently

00:51:39.126 --> 00:51:42.060 align:middle line:84%
than as just human
beings, just normal boys?

00:51:42.060 --> 00:51:47.349 align:middle line:84%
Or was there always this complex
overlay, that they knew things?

00:51:47.349 --> 00:51:48.890 align:middle line:84%
>>ANN: Yeah, I think
there was always

00:51:48.890 --> 00:51:54.595 align:middle line:84%
this overlay, as you say, that
they're a little bit different.

00:51:54.595 --> 00:51:55.750 align:middle line:90%
But different is good.

00:51:55.750 --> 00:51:57.790 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes, yes, absolutely.

00:51:57.790 --> 00:52:00.286 align:middle line:84%
I wouldn't talk
to you otherwise.

00:52:00.286 --> 00:52:02.660 align:middle line:90%
>>ANN: But yeah.

00:52:02.660 --> 00:52:04.810 align:middle line:84%
As I say, we used
to do normal things.

00:52:04.810 --> 00:52:06.340 align:middle line:90%
We still have bills to pay.

00:52:06.340 --> 00:52:08.570 align:middle line:84%
And they wouldn't
pay our mortgage,

00:52:08.570 --> 00:52:09.530 align:middle line:90%
so we've got to do it.

00:52:09.530 --> 00:52:10.960 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And the
family just live

00:52:10.960 --> 00:52:12.620 align:middle line:84%
with the knowledge at
nighttime, maybe things

00:52:12.620 --> 00:52:14.411 align:middle line:84%
were different for your
family than others.

00:52:14.411 --> 00:52:16.960 align:middle line:90%
>>ANN: Exactly.

00:52:16.960 --> 00:52:20.900 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Tell us about
Jason and some of the traits,

00:52:20.900 --> 00:52:23.600 align:middle line:84%
because oftentimes
with this experience,

00:52:23.600 --> 00:52:26.990 align:middle line:84%
the humans end up kind of
upgraded in their abilities

00:52:26.990 --> 00:52:29.430 align:middle line:84%
telepathically
and energetically.

00:52:29.430 --> 00:52:32.780 align:middle line:84%
Can you talk about
what developed in him?

00:52:32.780 --> 00:52:35.860 align:middle line:90%
>>ANN: Yes, of course.

00:52:35.860 --> 00:52:40.330 align:middle line:84%
He is an excellent healer,
exceptionally good.

00:52:40.330 --> 00:52:43.770 align:middle line:84%
I remember a time when friends
of ours, obviously who know

00:52:43.770 --> 00:52:48.340 align:middle line:84%
our story, asked if they
could come and see Jason.

00:52:48.340 --> 00:52:50.490 align:middle line:90%
And he kept refusing.

00:52:50.490 --> 00:52:52.932 align:middle line:84%
And he said, no,
time's not right.

00:52:52.932 --> 00:52:55.140 align:middle line:84%
And then one day over his
Corn Flakes, he said to me,

00:52:55.140 --> 00:52:57.350 align:middle line:84%
oh, tell your friend if
they want to come today

00:52:57.350 --> 00:53:00.040 align:middle line:84%
or tomorrow, he said,
that would be fine.

00:53:00.040 --> 00:53:01.480 align:middle line:84%
So of course, we
told our friends.

00:53:01.480 --> 00:53:03.890 align:middle line:84%
And it was a good
friend of ours.

00:53:03.890 --> 00:53:06.520 align:middle line:84%
And he had a problem
with his neck.

00:53:06.520 --> 00:53:08.770 align:middle line:84%
He'd damaged the
muscles in his neck.

00:53:08.770 --> 00:53:11.820 align:middle line:84%
And he'd been to--
is it chiropractors?

00:53:11.820 --> 00:53:14.660 align:middle line:84%
And he'd been to various
hospitals and clinics.

00:53:14.660 --> 00:53:18.290 align:middle line:84%
And nobody could alleviate
the pain for him.

00:53:18.290 --> 00:53:20.920 align:middle line:90%
So he came and sat with Jason.

00:53:20.920 --> 00:53:24.170 align:middle line:84%
And they were talking about
everything from football

00:53:24.170 --> 00:53:26.652 align:middle line:90%
to girls to you name it.

00:53:26.652 --> 00:53:28.610 align:middle line:84%
And then the guy sat
there and looked at Jason,

00:53:28.610 --> 00:53:30.318 align:middle line:84%
and he said, well,
you know why I'm here.

00:53:30.318 --> 00:53:32.896 align:middle line:84%
And Jason said-- It was quite
funny, because he was fumbling

00:53:32.896 --> 00:53:34.770 align:middle line:84%
with a chocolate bar
and he couldn't open it.

00:53:34.770 --> 00:53:37.390 align:middle line:90%


00:53:37.390 --> 00:53:39.500 align:middle line:84%
And Jason just said, yeah,
I know why you're here.

00:53:39.500 --> 00:53:41.000 align:middle line:84%
And he said, well,
can you help me?

00:53:41.000 --> 00:53:43.140 align:middle line:84%
And he just looked at
him, a great big grin,

00:53:43.140 --> 00:53:44.096 align:middle line:90%
and he said, done.

00:53:44.096 --> 00:53:44.720 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Done.

00:53:44.720 --> 00:53:45.234 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHTER]

00:53:45.234 --> 00:53:46.650 align:middle line:84%
>>ANN: And the
bloke just suddenly

00:53:46.650 --> 00:53:49.660 align:middle line:84%
went-- don't believe--
I can't believe it.

00:53:49.660 --> 00:53:51.040 align:middle line:90%
No, there's no way.

00:53:51.040 --> 00:53:52.020 align:middle line:90%
I can't believe this.

00:53:52.020 --> 00:53:54.880 align:middle line:84%
And he was like, well, that's
what you wanted, wasn't it?

00:53:54.880 --> 00:53:58.230 align:middle line:84%
And he said, why do
you come and ask me,

00:53:58.230 --> 00:54:01.457 align:middle line:84%
and then you said
you don't believe it?

00:54:01.457 --> 00:54:03.540 align:middle line:84%
And then he still couldn't
open his chocolate bar,

00:54:03.540 --> 00:54:07.370 align:middle line:84%
which seemed a bit of an odd--
you know, you can do this,

00:54:07.370 --> 00:54:08.145 align:middle line:90%
but you can't--

00:54:08.145 --> 00:54:08.560 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Total distraction.

00:54:08.560 --> 00:54:09.830 align:middle line:90%
That's really interesting.

00:54:09.830 --> 00:54:11.550 align:middle line:90%
>>ANN: Yeah, exactly.

00:54:11.550 --> 00:54:14.560 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And also, I
assume throughout his life,

00:54:14.560 --> 00:54:17.610 align:middle line:84%
he's remained quite
telepathic and open?

00:54:17.610 --> 00:54:18.990 align:middle line:90%
>>ANN: Yes, he is.

00:54:18.990 --> 00:54:21.530 align:middle line:90%
He is telepathic.

00:54:21.530 --> 00:54:25.091 align:middle line:84%
So yes, it's a bit of a pain
when it comes to Christmastime,

00:54:25.091 --> 00:54:26.340 align:middle line:90%
because he always knows what--

00:54:26.340 --> 00:54:26.640 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: You
can't surprise him.

00:54:26.640 --> 00:54:28.139 align:middle line:84%
>>ANN: Yeah, you
can't surprise him.

00:54:28.139 --> 00:54:30.420 align:middle line:90%
He knows what you've got him.

00:54:30.420 --> 00:54:33.120 align:middle line:84%
I mean, I remember one
year we got him a suit

00:54:33.120 --> 00:54:36.319 align:middle line:84%
that we thought, well, it's
time he had a proper suit.

00:54:36.319 --> 00:54:38.860 align:middle line:84%
And he said to us, oh, I don't
like the one with the stripes.

00:54:38.860 --> 00:54:39.840 align:middle line:90%
Can you get me the plain one?

00:54:39.840 --> 00:54:40.965 align:middle line:90%
And we're like, plain what?

00:54:40.965 --> 00:54:43.590 align:middle line:90%
He said, plain suit.

00:54:43.590 --> 00:54:45.170 align:middle line:90%
OK, we give up.

00:54:45.170 --> 00:54:48.510 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And so he's
recently married.

00:54:48.510 --> 00:54:51.800 align:middle line:84%
Well, he's trying to live a
regular life of sorts, right?

00:54:51.800 --> 00:54:53.690 align:middle line:84%
But were there
any other messages

00:54:53.690 --> 00:54:55.880 align:middle line:84%
that came along that
were of a profound nature

00:54:55.880 --> 00:54:58.710 align:middle line:90%
that we need to know about?

00:54:58.710 --> 00:55:01.170 align:middle line:84%
>>ANN: He said that the
most important thing

00:55:01.170 --> 00:55:05.750 align:middle line:84%
is that he's here with
thousands of other star children

00:55:05.750 --> 00:55:11.460 align:middle line:84%
to help us to move into the--
is it the fifth dimension?

00:55:11.460 --> 00:55:15.110 align:middle line:84%
He said we're all
sort of reverberating

00:55:15.110 --> 00:55:18.000 align:middle line:84%
in the fourth dimension
at the moment.

00:55:18.000 --> 00:55:19.750 align:middle line:90%
But he said we need to move on.

00:55:19.750 --> 00:55:22.970 align:middle line:84%
But he said we need to get
to that spritual-- you know,

00:55:22.970 --> 00:55:25.900 align:middle line:90%
the spiritual part.

00:55:25.900 --> 00:55:27.900 align:middle line:84%
He said not
everybody will attain

00:55:27.900 --> 00:55:29.750 align:middle line:84%
that, he said, because,
he said, some minds

00:55:29.750 --> 00:55:32.470 align:middle line:90%
are just totally closed.

00:55:32.470 --> 00:55:35.350 align:middle line:84%
But he said, it's our job-- that
is the most important thing,

00:55:35.350 --> 00:55:38.600 align:middle line:84%
he said, is to
help to-- you know,

00:55:38.600 --> 00:55:41.410 align:middle line:90%
to help with the transition.

00:55:41.410 --> 00:55:45.630 align:middle line:84%
And he said, you know,
before long, money

00:55:45.630 --> 00:55:49.910 align:middle line:84%
won't mean anything, because
the planet is already

00:55:49.910 --> 00:55:52.180 align:middle line:84%
rebelling against
what we're doing

00:55:52.180 --> 00:55:54.700 align:middle line:84%
to it, which is a
no-brainer, really.

00:55:54.700 --> 00:55:55.520 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:55:55.520 --> 00:55:59.430 align:middle line:84%
>>ANN: But he said, the
way that you're all going,

00:55:59.430 --> 00:56:00.880 align:middle line:84%
you're just going
to do it again.

00:56:00.880 --> 00:56:02.921 align:middle line:84%
He said, you're going to
just destroy the planet,

00:56:02.921 --> 00:56:05.420 align:middle line:84%
you're going to
destroy yourselves.

00:56:05.420 --> 00:56:08.040 align:middle line:84%
He said, you've done it
so many times before.

00:56:08.040 --> 00:56:10.810 align:middle line:84%
He said, you came
so close with-- I

00:56:10.810 --> 00:56:12.180 align:middle line:90%
remember him sitting there.

00:56:12.180 --> 00:56:16.350 align:middle line:84%
And he was talking like
an orator, if you like.

00:56:16.350 --> 00:56:20.115 align:middle line:84%
And he said, you know, you had,
like, the Atlantian culture.

00:56:20.115 --> 00:56:22.660 align:middle line:90%


00:56:22.660 --> 00:56:24.490 align:middle line:90%
He was talking as "we."

00:56:24.490 --> 00:56:27.250 align:middle line:84%
He said, we were so proud
of you at that moment,

00:56:27.250 --> 00:56:29.590 align:middle line:84%
because you nearly
got it, he said.

00:56:29.590 --> 00:56:31.890 align:middle line:90%
You were so close.

00:56:31.890 --> 00:56:34.260 align:middle line:90%
He said, you were nearly there.

00:56:34.260 --> 00:56:36.330 align:middle line:84%
And then, he said,
somebody wanted something

00:56:36.330 --> 00:56:40.070 align:middle line:84%
that someone else had got, he
said, and there you go again.

00:56:40.070 --> 00:56:42.950 align:middle line:84%
And he said, you basically
screwed it up for yourselves

00:56:42.950 --> 00:56:43.570 align:middle line:90%
yet again.

00:56:43.570 --> 00:56:47.260 align:middle line:90%


00:56:47.260 --> 00:56:50.770 align:middle line:90%
He said, it's scary to watch.

00:56:50.770 --> 00:56:56.080 align:middle line:84%
But he said, this time
will be at your last try.

00:56:56.080 --> 00:56:58.410 align:middle line:84%
He said, if you don't
get it right this time,

00:56:58.410 --> 00:57:01.402 align:middle line:90%
you don't got another chance.

00:57:01.402 --> 00:57:03.360 align:middle line:84%
So that was one of the
most important messages.

00:57:03.360 --> 00:57:04.943 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And what
did he seem to-- as

00:57:04.943 --> 00:57:10.130 align:middle line:84%
kind of a final statement, as
we're almost out of time, what

00:57:10.130 --> 00:57:14.180 align:middle line:84%
did he say we need to
embrace and do ourselves?

00:57:14.180 --> 00:57:14.960 align:middle line:90%
>>ANN: Right.

00:57:14.960 --> 00:57:15.460 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:57:15.460 --> 00:57:21.860 align:middle line:10%
Somebody actually asked him
what his view of everything is.

00:57:21.860 --> 00:57:27.440 align:middle line:10%
And he said, well, he said,
the only enduring factor

00:57:27.440 --> 00:57:30.930 align:middle line:10%
in the whole of the universe,
he said, is the energy of love.

00:57:30.930 --> 00:57:32.150 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Love, yes.

00:57:32.150 --> 00:57:34.180 align:middle line:10%
>>ANN: And he said,
until you can actually

00:57:34.180 --> 00:57:37.630 align:middle line:10%
embrace that, he said, and
allow it to encompass you,

00:57:37.630 --> 00:57:41.935 align:middle line:10%
he said, then, he said, you are
not going to get much further.

00:57:41.935 --> 00:57:44.720 align:middle line:10%
But he said it is
the energy of love

00:57:44.720 --> 00:57:48.630 align:middle line:10%
that will keep the
universe alive.

00:57:48.630 --> 00:57:50.080 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Absolutely.

00:57:50.080 --> 00:57:54.340 align:middle line:84%
And I think it's always
important to note that there

00:57:54.340 --> 00:57:57.340 align:middle line:84%
are many, many bodies out
there in the universe.

00:57:57.340 --> 00:57:58.760 align:middle line:84%
There are many
different planets.

00:57:58.760 --> 00:58:00.670 align:middle line:90%
There are many places.

00:58:00.670 --> 00:58:04.240 align:middle line:84%
And that there is always
this eternal opportunity

00:58:04.240 --> 00:58:07.946 align:middle line:84%
for expansion, even if it's not
in the same venue, necessarily.

00:58:07.946 --> 00:58:08.880 align:middle line:90%
>>ANN: Yes.

00:58:08.880 --> 00:58:10.135 align:middle line:10%
Yes, I agree.

00:58:10.135 --> 00:58:12.190 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So all we
have to do is really,

00:58:12.190 --> 00:58:14.710 align:middle line:84%
deeply connect to
the source of love

00:58:14.710 --> 00:58:16.320 align:middle line:90%
that's beyond anything personal.

00:58:16.320 --> 00:58:17.330 align:middle line:90%
>>ANN: Yes.

00:58:17.330 --> 00:58:19.340 align:middle line:90%
I believe that that is the key.

00:58:19.340 --> 00:58:21.910 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And thank you
so much for your story.

00:58:21.910 --> 00:58:25.400 align:middle line:84%
It's a little frightening for
some moms and dads out there.

00:58:25.400 --> 00:58:30.490 align:middle line:84%
But it's also very inspiring
and what an incredible and brave

00:58:30.490 --> 00:58:33.600 align:middle line:84%
journey you've been through--
your dad, you, your sons.

00:58:33.600 --> 00:58:35.250 align:middle line:84%
And who knows about
their children.

00:58:35.250 --> 00:58:36.110 align:middle line:90%
>>ANN: Exactly.

00:58:36.110 --> 00:58:36.610 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

00:58:36.610 --> 00:58:39.082 align:middle line:90%
That's all to come. [LAUGHS]

00:58:39.082 --> 00:58:40.046 align:middle line:90%


00:58:40.046 --> 00:58:42.540 align:middle line:10%
>>REGINA: If you'd like to
connect with Ann directly,

00:58:42.540 --> 00:58:44.800 align:middle line:10%
maybe you want to share a
personal story and get some
