00:00:08.888 --> 00:00:11.180 align:middle line:84%
>>SEAN MCNAMARA: I started
training in these traditions

00:00:11.180 --> 00:00:14.180 align:middle line:84%
because I was seeking an
answer about life after death.

00:00:14.180 --> 00:00:17.990 align:middle line:84%
And instead, I became
a good Buddhist.

00:00:17.990 --> 00:00:19.700 align:middle line:90%
I wanted evidence.

00:00:19.700 --> 00:00:20.960 align:middle line:90%
I want an experience.

00:00:20.960 --> 00:00:23.670 align:middle line:84%
I didn't just want
to operate on faith.

00:00:23.670 --> 00:00:26.780 align:middle line:84%
I didn't need to give away my
power anymore to anybody else

00:00:26.780 --> 00:00:30.440 align:middle line:84%
that if I work hard enough at
it, I can find my own answers.

00:00:30.440 --> 00:00:32.600 align:middle line:84%
First major experiment
I did with them was I

00:00:32.600 --> 00:00:34.640 align:middle line:84%
would put them in
a chair massage,

00:00:34.640 --> 00:00:37.790 align:middle line:84%
created targets for them to
view while they were getting

00:00:37.790 --> 00:00:40.580 align:middle line:84%
massages, and after
the massage was done

00:00:40.580 --> 00:00:43.340 align:middle line:84%
and I would open the
envelope and show them

00:00:43.340 --> 00:00:45.800 align:middle line:90%
the image, and both of our jaws.

00:00:45.800 --> 00:00:48.392 align:middle line:84%
So I asked them to dunk their
arms in buckets of ice water.

00:00:48.392 --> 00:00:49.850 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA MEREDITH:
So you're asking

00:00:49.850 --> 00:00:52.295 align:middle line:84%
them to be both relaxed and
excited at the same time?

00:00:52.295 --> 00:00:53.720 align:middle line:84%
>>MCNAMARA: At the
present and of the future.

00:00:53.720 --> 00:00:54.275 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:00:54.275 --> 00:00:56.150 align:middle line:84%
>>MCNAMARA: Training
in psychic abilities

00:00:56.150 --> 00:00:58.880 align:middle line:84%
has opened me up, where I
started having experiences

00:00:58.880 --> 00:01:00.380 align:middle line:90%
with non-human entities.

00:01:00.380 --> 00:01:02.840 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: How do you cut
through the programming

00:01:02.840 --> 00:01:05.180 align:middle line:84%
and start developing
your psychic abilities

00:01:05.180 --> 00:01:06.290 align:middle line:90%
such as remote viewing?

00:01:06.290 --> 00:01:10.350 align:middle line:90%


00:01:10.350 --> 00:01:12.900 align:middle line:10%
Most everyone in this audience
has heard of remote viewing

00:01:12.900 --> 00:01:15.990 align:middle line:10%
but often thinks it's just for
secret ops or military use.

00:01:15.990 --> 00:01:18.150 align:middle line:10%
No, it's for you and me.

00:01:18.150 --> 00:01:20.040 align:middle line:10%
Sean McNamara had
a different path

00:01:20.040 --> 00:01:21.660 align:middle line:10%
to becoming a remote viewer.

00:01:21.660 --> 00:01:23.850 align:middle line:84%
It was a result of
all things, some

00:01:23.850 --> 00:01:25.863 align:middle line:84%
uncomfortableness during
Buddhist training.

00:01:25.863 --> 00:01:27.280 align:middle line:84%
We'll get to that
in a little bit.

00:01:27.280 --> 00:01:30.450 align:middle line:10%
But more importantly, he came
to realize that this skill

00:01:30.450 --> 00:01:34.140 align:middle line:10%
set will set humanity free and
now teaches it to the public.

00:01:34.140 --> 00:01:34.980 align:middle line:90%
Welcome, Sean.

00:01:34.980 --> 00:01:36.280 align:middle line:90%
It's so good to have you here.

00:01:36.280 --> 00:01:37.480 align:middle line:84%
>>MCNAMARA: It's great
to be here, Regina.

00:01:37.480 --> 00:01:38.280 align:middle line:90%
Thank you.

00:01:38.280 --> 00:01:40.080 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: I love remote viewing.

00:01:40.080 --> 00:01:42.000 align:middle line:84%
I think I love remote
viewing so much

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:44.590 align:middle line:90%
because I agree 100% with you--

00:01:44.590 --> 00:01:46.110 align:middle line:84%
this is our path
to freedom where

00:01:46.110 --> 00:01:49.860 align:middle line:84%
we can't be lied to anymore
because right now trying

00:01:49.860 --> 00:01:53.730 align:middle line:84%
to find truth in any form is
become a challenge for humanity

00:01:53.730 --> 00:01:55.300 align:middle line:90%
amongst all the manipulations.

00:01:55.300 --> 00:01:57.120 align:middle line:84%
So why don't you take
it away from there

00:01:57.120 --> 00:01:59.550 align:middle line:84%
about what you were
doing that led you to it?

00:01:59.550 --> 00:02:01.258 align:middle line:84%
I teased it a little
bit in the open.

00:02:01.258 --> 00:02:02.800 align:middle line:84%
We'll go through
that pretty quickly.

00:02:02.800 --> 00:02:06.330 align:middle line:84%
You're actually years
into Buddhist training

00:02:06.330 --> 00:02:07.830 align:middle line:84%
and you've learned
to use your mind?

00:02:07.830 --> 00:02:08.639 align:middle line:90%
>>MCNAMARA: Yeah.

00:02:08.639 --> 00:02:10.620 align:middle line:84%
That was probably
the biggest gift

00:02:10.620 --> 00:02:12.570 align:middle line:84%
from all the training
I had received

00:02:12.570 --> 00:02:14.940 align:middle line:84%
in a particular
tradition of Buddhism.

00:02:14.940 --> 00:02:19.230 align:middle line:10%
And at a certain point, I've
just seen too much bad behavior

00:02:19.230 --> 00:02:22.050 align:middle line:10%
from some of the teachers
in these traditions.

00:02:22.050 --> 00:02:25.170 align:middle line:84%
So I don't mean to criticize
the religion or the tradition,

00:02:25.170 --> 00:02:26.640 align:middle line:90%
but people are people.

00:02:26.640 --> 00:02:31.470 align:middle line:10%
>>REGINA: Gurus always seem to
kind of succumb a little bit

00:02:31.470 --> 00:02:33.565 align:middle line:10%
to all the attention
and flattery.

00:02:33.565 --> 00:02:36.120 align:middle line:84%
>>MCNAMARA: And along with
seeing that side of things,

00:02:36.120 --> 00:02:39.330 align:middle line:84%
I also realized that I had
given up my personal quest

00:02:39.330 --> 00:02:42.283 align:middle line:90%
for becoming a meditator.

00:02:42.283 --> 00:02:43.950 align:middle line:84%
I'd started training
in these traditions

00:02:43.950 --> 00:02:46.860 align:middle line:84%
because I was seeking an
answer about life after death.

00:02:46.860 --> 00:02:51.240 align:middle line:10%
And instead, I became
a good Buddhist,

00:02:51.240 --> 00:02:52.800 align:middle line:10%
which you could do
with any religion

00:02:52.800 --> 00:02:56.430 align:middle line:10%
where you just start to follow
the dogma, the techniques,

00:02:56.430 --> 00:03:00.030 align:middle line:10%
and you try and fill that form
so that you're a good model.

00:03:00.030 --> 00:03:02.910 align:middle line:84%
And then you'll get
to nirvana, heaven,

00:03:02.910 --> 00:03:06.653 align:middle line:84%
whatever it is the end goal is
suddenly that becomes the path.

00:03:06.653 --> 00:03:08.070 align:middle line:84%
But that wasn't
why I got started,

00:03:08.070 --> 00:03:11.400 align:middle line:84%
but I forgot my
original intention.

00:03:11.400 --> 00:03:14.100 align:middle line:10%
And maybe it was
a gift that I had

00:03:14.100 --> 00:03:17.570 align:middle line:10%
some negative interactions--

00:03:17.570 --> 00:03:18.530 align:middle line:10%
>>REGINA: Set you free.

00:03:18.530 --> 00:03:20.572 align:middle line:84%
>>MCNAMARA: --that set me
free because I realized

00:03:20.572 --> 00:03:22.640 align:middle line:84%
I'd forgotten my
path and my path

00:03:22.640 --> 00:03:25.210 align:middle line:84%
was to find some answers
that I wasn't getting.

00:03:25.210 --> 00:03:28.560 align:middle line:84%
But now I was free to
try other ways, so I--

00:03:28.560 --> 00:03:30.710 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: With that deep
background in meditation

00:03:30.710 --> 00:03:31.790 align:middle line:90%
and reflectiveness.

00:03:31.790 --> 00:03:32.990 align:middle line:10%
>>MCNAMARA: Exactly.

00:03:32.990 --> 00:03:37.100 align:middle line:84%
I built up the inner
discipline because meditation

00:03:37.100 --> 00:03:42.260 align:middle line:84%
takes that discipline to
practice on a daily basis

00:03:42.260 --> 00:03:45.080 align:middle line:84%
to look at the mind,
to be discerning

00:03:45.080 --> 00:03:49.640 align:middle line:84%
when looking at what's coming
up, and developing the strength

00:03:49.640 --> 00:03:52.500 align:middle line:84%
and clarity to see things
on a more subtle level.

00:03:52.500 --> 00:03:55.370 align:middle line:84%
So that was the gift of all the
training and I took that gift

00:03:55.370 --> 00:03:57.350 align:middle line:84%
and started doing
my own exploring.

00:03:57.350 --> 00:04:00.230 align:middle line:84%
And the first thing I did
was I trained consistently

00:04:00.230 --> 00:04:02.810 align:middle line:84%
to have an out-of-body
experience, which I did,

00:04:02.810 --> 00:04:05.420 align:middle line:84%
and that took away my
fear of death right away.

00:04:05.420 --> 00:04:09.207 align:middle line:84%
So that really clinched it that
I needed to find my own path

00:04:09.207 --> 00:04:10.790 align:middle line:84%
and find my own
answers and that would

00:04:10.790 --> 00:04:15.690 align:middle line:84%
be more powerful than
following someone else's path.

00:04:15.690 --> 00:04:16.565 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Absolutely.

00:04:16.565 --> 00:04:17.810 align:middle line:84%
>>MCNAMARA: Maybe
it's personality

00:04:17.810 --> 00:04:18.665 align:middle line:90%
based because I'm stubborn.

00:04:18.665 --> 00:04:18.950 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHTER]

00:04:18.950 --> 00:04:19.940 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:04:19.940 --> 00:04:21.269 align:middle line:90%
You want to do it your way?

00:04:21.269 --> 00:04:22.160 align:middle line:84%
>>MCNAMARA: I want
to do it my way.

00:04:22.160 --> 00:04:22.520 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHTER]

00:04:22.520 --> 00:04:24.620 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Well, when you were
young you had some health

00:04:24.620 --> 00:04:25.580 align:middle line:90%
issues.

00:04:25.580 --> 00:04:28.760 align:middle line:10%
So you did have questions
about oh gosh, if I die--

00:04:28.760 --> 00:04:29.810 align:middle line:10%
you were afraid of death?

00:04:29.810 --> 00:04:31.370 align:middle line:84%
>>MCNAMARA: I was
afraid of death.

00:04:31.370 --> 00:04:33.380 align:middle line:84%
And all these
beautiful religions

00:04:33.380 --> 00:04:36.845 align:middle line:84%
that I'd grown up in-- the
Catholicism, then Buddhism,

00:04:36.845 --> 00:04:43.322 align:middle line:84%
and been exposed to others,
they offer some information

00:04:43.322 --> 00:04:45.280 align:middle line:84%
to make you feel better
about the dying process

00:04:45.280 --> 00:04:46.447 align:middle line:90%
and what happens afterwards.

00:04:46.447 --> 00:04:49.360 align:middle line:84%
But I wanted evidence,
I want an experience,

00:04:49.360 --> 00:04:51.940 align:middle line:84%
I didn't just want
to operate on faith.

00:04:51.940 --> 00:04:54.160 align:middle line:84%
And the out-of-body
experience gave me

00:04:54.160 --> 00:04:56.380 align:middle line:84%
that evidential
experience that's

00:04:56.380 --> 00:05:00.800 align:middle line:84%
something that is part
of me is not physical,

00:05:00.800 --> 00:05:04.430 align:middle line:84%
is beyond physical, and I have
complete trust that part will

00:05:04.430 --> 00:05:07.110 align:middle line:90%
linger on after the body dies.

00:05:07.110 --> 00:05:07.910 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:05:07.910 --> 00:05:09.410 align:middle line:84%
And those out-of-body
experiences

00:05:09.410 --> 00:05:10.720 align:middle line:90%
pretty much I state for you.

00:05:10.720 --> 00:05:12.470 align:middle line:84%
You realized you were
more than your body.

00:05:12.470 --> 00:05:13.520 align:middle line:90%
>>MCNAMARA: Absolutely.

00:05:13.520 --> 00:05:15.740 align:middle line:90%
And that it belonged to me.

00:05:15.740 --> 00:05:19.520 align:middle line:84%
I didn't have to turn my
power over anymore to a guru,

00:05:19.520 --> 00:05:23.570 align:middle line:84%
to a teacher, to a priest,
to a religion, to a dogma.

00:05:23.570 --> 00:05:26.270 align:middle line:84%
My experience was something
that I owned completely.

00:05:26.270 --> 00:05:27.140 align:middle line:90%
I worked for it.

00:05:27.140 --> 00:05:31.220 align:middle line:84%
I had it and I saw some
true part of my nature

00:05:31.220 --> 00:05:33.530 align:middle line:84%
and I realized
that I didn't need

00:05:33.530 --> 00:05:36.140 align:middle line:84%
to give away my power
anymore to anybody else.

00:05:36.140 --> 00:05:39.170 align:middle line:84%
And I didn't need to ask anyone
else for their interpretation

00:05:39.170 --> 00:05:42.710 align:middle line:84%
of what reality is that if
I work hard enough at it

00:05:42.710 --> 00:05:44.780 align:middle line:90%
I can find my own answers.

00:05:44.780 --> 00:05:46.940 align:middle line:84%
And of course, is
there some part of me

00:05:46.940 --> 00:05:48.320 align:middle line:90%
that isn't just physical?

00:05:48.320 --> 00:05:49.710 align:middle line:90%
That's only one question.

00:05:49.710 --> 00:05:51.980 align:middle line:84%
There's so many
other questions too.

00:05:51.980 --> 00:05:55.490 align:middle line:84%
But no longer being
afraid of dying

00:05:55.490 --> 00:05:59.750 align:middle line:84%
frees me up energetically to
do the exploration because now

00:05:59.750 --> 00:06:02.450 align:middle line:84%
it's not just a desperate
need for security

00:06:02.450 --> 00:06:04.528 align:middle line:84%
but there's a curiosity
there, there's play,

00:06:04.528 --> 00:06:05.570 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: It's all safer.

00:06:05.570 --> 00:06:06.320 align:middle line:90%
>>MCNAMARA: There's imagination.

00:06:06.320 --> 00:06:06.740 align:middle line:90%
I feel--

00:06:06.740 --> 00:06:09.082 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Because you're
going to go on no matter what.

00:06:09.082 --> 00:06:10.040 align:middle line:90%
>>MCNAMARA: Absolutely.

00:06:10.040 --> 00:06:11.420 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:06:11.420 --> 00:06:14.270 align:middle line:84%
When you first started remote
viewing, did you go to a school

00:06:14.270 --> 00:06:17.720 align:middle line:84%
to do that initially, or how
did you initially get into it?

00:06:17.720 --> 00:06:19.730 align:middle line:84%
>>MCNAMARA: So two
different things happen.

00:06:19.730 --> 00:06:20.780 align:middle line:90%
One was I took a--

00:06:20.780 --> 00:06:23.268 align:middle line:84%
I think it was from his book,
David Morehouse, who was one

00:06:23.268 --> 00:06:24.560 align:middle line:90%
of the original remote viewers.

00:06:24.560 --> 00:06:29.930 align:middle line:84%
So I took his book course
and around the same time

00:06:29.930 --> 00:06:33.470 align:middle line:84%
I was taking a year-long
training program in mediumship.

00:06:33.470 --> 00:06:38.180 align:middle line:84%
And the teacher also trained
us in basic clairvoyance,

00:06:38.180 --> 00:06:41.960 align:middle line:84%
and she used some remote
viewing exercises too.

00:06:41.960 --> 00:06:45.140 align:middle line:84%
So that was some classroom-type
training that I did.

00:06:45.140 --> 00:06:47.872 align:middle line:84%
And then learning
everything I could online

00:06:47.872 --> 00:06:49.580 align:middle line:84%
and from different
remote viewing groups.

00:06:49.580 --> 00:06:52.770 align:middle line:10%
>>REGINA: And you also had
another overlay in all of this,

00:06:52.770 --> 00:06:55.310 align:middle line:10%
which was that you had
been a massage therapist,

00:06:55.310 --> 00:07:00.000 align:middle line:10%
so you knew the meridians of
the body and how the body works

00:07:00.000 --> 00:07:02.280 align:middle line:10%
with information
and intelligence,

00:07:02.280 --> 00:07:04.280 align:middle line:10%
which I think that's a
part a lot of people--

00:07:04.280 --> 00:07:06.238 align:middle line:10%
when it comes to remote
viewing a lot of people

00:07:06.238 --> 00:07:08.690 align:middle line:10%
don't know that this
even is a thing.

00:07:08.690 --> 00:07:09.490 align:middle line:90%
>>MCNAMARA: Yeah.

00:07:09.490 --> 00:07:10.660 align:middle line:90%
Well, it's funny.

00:07:10.660 --> 00:07:14.110 align:middle line:84%
The massage therapy, I
did that for seven years.

00:07:14.110 --> 00:07:16.700 align:middle line:84%
And I think anyone out
there who's had a massage,

00:07:16.700 --> 00:07:19.420 align:middle line:84%
maybe your massage
therapist is someone

00:07:19.420 --> 00:07:22.390 align:middle line:84%
you've had a relationship
for several years.

00:07:22.390 --> 00:07:24.520 align:middle line:84%
This happens where
once in a while

00:07:24.520 --> 00:07:26.710 align:middle line:84%
the therapist will
start saying something

00:07:26.710 --> 00:07:28.520 align:middle line:84%
and the person laying
on the table says,

00:07:28.520 --> 00:07:30.190 align:middle line:84%
I was just thinking
that, or, this

00:07:30.190 --> 00:07:34.060 align:middle line:84%
was a question I've
been holding in my mind,

00:07:34.060 --> 00:07:37.210 align:middle line:84%
because there was a
spontaneous telepathic link,

00:07:37.210 --> 00:07:40.840 align:middle line:84%
and it was through
the physical contact.

00:07:40.840 --> 00:07:43.570 align:middle line:84%
Later on, I read this
book, "Psychic Discoveries

00:07:43.570 --> 00:07:45.165 align:middle line:90%
Behind the Iron Curtain."

00:07:45.165 --> 00:07:47.290 align:middle line:84%
And there's a chapter in
there and it's very brief.

00:07:47.290 --> 00:07:50.170 align:middle line:84%
I think it's just one or two
paragraphs where they discuss

00:07:50.170 --> 00:07:52.150 align:middle line:84%
finding certain
points on the body

00:07:52.150 --> 00:07:55.150 align:middle line:84%
that when they would be
manipulated as an acupressure

00:07:55.150 --> 00:07:58.300 align:middle line:84%
that it could stimulate
someone's psychic ability.

00:07:58.300 --> 00:07:59.140 align:middle line:90%
So with--

00:07:59.140 --> 00:08:00.025 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: There
are those points.

00:08:00.025 --> 00:08:01.000 align:middle line:90%
>>MCNAMARA: Exactly.

00:08:01.000 --> 00:08:01.870 align:middle line:90%
Well, so vague.

00:08:01.870 --> 00:08:03.130 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHTER]

00:08:03.130 --> 00:08:03.970 align:middle line:90%
So vague.

00:08:03.970 --> 00:08:05.950 align:middle line:84%
But I thought I would
do an experiment

00:08:05.950 --> 00:08:08.470 align:middle line:84%
with some friends, who I did
a series of remote viewing

00:08:08.470 --> 00:08:09.280 align:middle line:90%
experiments with.

00:08:09.280 --> 00:08:11.920 align:middle line:84%
Later on, we'd go on to win
a couple of small lotteries

00:08:11.920 --> 00:08:13.610 align:middle line:90%
using remote viewing.

00:08:13.610 --> 00:08:16.210 align:middle line:84%
But the first major experiment
I did with them was I

00:08:16.210 --> 00:08:18.520 align:middle line:84%
would put them in
a chair massage.

00:08:18.520 --> 00:08:21.010 align:middle line:84%
And being a therapist I
was the massage therapist

00:08:21.010 --> 00:08:23.350 align:middle line:84%
but I also created
targets for them

00:08:23.350 --> 00:08:26.330 align:middle line:84%
to view while they
were getting massage.

00:08:26.330 --> 00:08:29.560 align:middle line:84%
So I didn't have to worry about
what are the specific points.

00:08:29.560 --> 00:08:32.080 align:middle line:84%
I'll just massage
their whole body

00:08:32.080 --> 00:08:34.360 align:middle line:84%
while they were
clothed in a chair

00:08:34.360 --> 00:08:37.101 align:middle line:84%
and the target would be
in an envelope somewhere.

00:08:37.101 --> 00:08:38.559 align:middle line:84%
But while they're
in the chair they

00:08:38.559 --> 00:08:41.620 align:middle line:84%
had a clipboard and a paper,
and they knew the coordinate

00:08:41.620 --> 00:08:44.260 align:middle line:84%
because remote viewing uses
these coordinate numbers.

00:08:44.260 --> 00:08:47.680 align:middle line:84%
And their job while enjoying
this beautiful, delicious

00:08:47.680 --> 00:08:48.480 align:middle line:90%
massage--

00:08:48.480 --> 00:08:51.100 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Which puts you
in a very receptive state.

00:08:51.100 --> 00:08:55.060 align:middle line:84%
>>MCNAMARA: And comfortable,
relaxed, and at the same time

00:08:55.060 --> 00:08:59.500 align:middle line:84%
try and perceive the image
associated with this number.

00:08:59.500 --> 00:09:01.210 align:middle line:90%
And they started drawing.

00:09:01.210 --> 00:09:03.250 align:middle line:84%
I would meet with
them one by one.

00:09:03.250 --> 00:09:06.580 align:middle line:84%
And after the massage was
done, we'd go to another room

00:09:06.580 --> 00:09:09.820 align:middle line:84%
and I would open the envelope
and show them the image

00:09:09.820 --> 00:09:11.650 align:middle line:84%
and compare it to
their transcript.

00:09:11.650 --> 00:09:13.900 align:middle line:84%
And both of our jaws,
every time we'd follow--

00:09:13.900 --> 00:09:16.870 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So did you find
it was more effective when

00:09:16.870 --> 00:09:19.915 align:middle line:84%
you were actually hitting
certain points on the body?

00:09:19.915 --> 00:09:23.260 align:middle line:84%
>>MCNAMARA: It's
hard to tell exactly.

00:09:23.260 --> 00:09:26.500 align:middle line:84%
For some people, under
the base of the skull

00:09:26.500 --> 00:09:28.330 align:middle line:84%
worked really well,
this side of the neck.

00:09:28.330 --> 00:09:31.140 align:middle line:84%
But the vagus nerve works
here, so massaging it

00:09:31.140 --> 00:09:32.890 align:middle line:84%
stimulates the vagus
nerve, which puts you

00:09:32.890 --> 00:09:35.330 align:middle line:90%
in an even more relaxed state.

00:09:35.330 --> 00:09:38.500 align:middle line:84%
So those were really effective
places to work on people.

00:09:38.500 --> 00:09:40.955 align:middle line:84%
But sometimes the hands
were also really productive.

00:09:40.955 --> 00:09:41.755 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Oh, yeah.

00:09:41.755 --> 00:09:45.670 align:middle line:84%
>>MCNAMARA: Because all the
meridians and the fingertips.

00:09:45.670 --> 00:09:50.590 align:middle line:84%
So there's an Italian,
Giuseppe Calligaris,

00:09:50.590 --> 00:09:53.350 align:middle line:84%
who wrote a book about skin
plaques, little areas of skin

00:09:53.350 --> 00:09:56.620 align:middle line:84%
that if you stimulate them,
they would also make you psychic

00:09:56.620 --> 00:09:57.710 align:middle line:90%
or do other things.

00:09:57.710 --> 00:10:00.310 align:middle line:84%
And he had a couple
of points in the hand.

00:10:00.310 --> 00:10:03.620 align:middle line:84%
So I knew that the hands
would also be very helpful.

00:10:03.620 --> 00:10:06.490 align:middle line:84%
But in general, it was really
hard to determine exactly

00:10:06.490 --> 00:10:08.860 align:middle line:90%
which points did what.

00:10:08.860 --> 00:10:10.840 align:middle line:10%
But I could tell when
something was working

00:10:10.840 --> 00:10:13.423 align:middle line:10%
because they would have to lift
their head out of their cradle

00:10:13.423 --> 00:10:15.160 align:middle line:10%
and say, OK, please
give me one moment

00:10:15.160 --> 00:10:17.357 align:middle line:10%
as they looked at the page
and did their drawing.

00:10:17.357 --> 00:10:19.690 align:middle line:84%
And when they were done, they
would sink their head back

00:10:19.690 --> 00:10:22.870 align:middle line:84%
in the cradle and I would
continue the massage.

00:10:22.870 --> 00:10:25.900 align:middle line:84%
So sometimes I could tell like
I must be hitting something good

00:10:25.900 --> 00:10:27.820 align:middle line:84%
now because they just
lifted their head

00:10:27.820 --> 00:10:29.458 align:middle line:90%
and they're drawing something.

00:10:29.458 --> 00:10:31.750 align:middle line:84%
So that was really interesting
that there is, you know,

00:10:31.750 --> 00:10:35.140 align:middle line:84%
anyone who studies
acupuncture or massage therapy

00:10:35.140 --> 00:10:37.090 align:middle line:84%
or other healing
modalities knows

00:10:37.090 --> 00:10:40.090 align:middle line:84%
that the body-mind
connection is very strong.

00:10:40.090 --> 00:10:43.670 align:middle line:84%
And the body we could say
is an antenna in a sense.

00:10:43.670 --> 00:10:44.470 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:10:44.470 --> 00:10:46.100 align:middle line:90%
I totally agree with that.

00:10:46.100 --> 00:10:50.920 align:middle line:84%
And so massage work
might offer more benefits

00:10:50.920 --> 00:10:53.320 align:middle line:84%
than we previously thought,
especially if we're

00:10:53.320 --> 00:10:57.790 align:middle line:84%
working on opening up to other
dimensions of information,

00:10:57.790 --> 00:10:58.632 align:middle line:90%
for example, right?

00:10:58.632 --> 00:10:59.590 align:middle line:90%
>>MCNAMARA: Absolutely.

00:10:59.590 --> 00:11:02.020 align:middle line:84%
I think this gives another
reason why self-care

00:11:02.020 --> 00:11:06.190 align:middle line:84%
is so important because if
anything stress, tension,

00:11:06.190 --> 00:11:07.107 align:middle line:90%
and fear shut us down.

00:11:07.107 --> 00:11:08.857 align:middle line:84%
And I know that
personally that shut down.

00:11:08.857 --> 00:11:11.110 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And the last
couple of years everybody's

00:11:11.110 --> 00:11:13.480 align:middle line:84%
been in stress,
tension, and fear.

00:11:13.480 --> 00:11:14.570 align:middle line:90%
>>MCNAMARA: Absolutely.

00:11:14.570 --> 00:11:17.470 align:middle line:84%
So it's been a really rough
time on a psychic level

00:11:17.470 --> 00:11:20.480 align:middle line:84%
and also on a very basic
day-to-day level for everyone.

00:11:20.480 --> 00:11:22.505 align:middle line:90%
So self-care.

00:11:22.505 --> 00:11:24.880 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: That's interesting
because when you think about

00:11:24.880 --> 00:11:26.980 align:middle line:90%
it--

00:11:26.980 --> 00:11:29.320 align:middle line:84%
we're not going to go down
the conspiracy rabbit hole,

00:11:29.320 --> 00:11:31.630 align:middle line:84%
but everyone watching
this knows by now

00:11:31.630 --> 00:11:33.340 align:middle line:84%
if they've been
watching my shows

00:11:33.340 --> 00:11:36.250 align:middle line:84%
or Gaia shows for
a while, that there

00:11:36.250 --> 00:11:41.230 align:middle line:84%
seems to be some kind of force,
whatever you want to call it.

00:11:41.230 --> 00:11:42.610 align:middle line:90%
You can ask questions about it.

00:11:42.610 --> 00:11:44.530 align:middle line:84%
Maybe you can't name it
exactly, but everyone

00:11:44.530 --> 00:11:47.950 align:middle line:84%
knows there's something that
seems to be projecting itself

00:11:47.950 --> 00:11:51.730 align:middle line:84%
in the human program to
create more and more fear,

00:11:51.730 --> 00:11:55.360 align:middle line:84%
more and more sense of
lack, more and more lack

00:11:55.360 --> 00:11:57.220 align:middle line:90%
of confidence in self.

00:11:57.220 --> 00:11:59.590 align:middle line:84%
Don't listen to yourself,
listen to the experts.

00:11:59.590 --> 00:12:01.930 align:middle line:84%
And then, of course, we
had the whole COVID thing

00:12:01.930 --> 00:12:05.560 align:middle line:84%
where everybody you do
what we say top-down.

00:12:05.560 --> 00:12:08.890 align:middle line:10%
Nice countries turning into
fascist states practically.

00:12:08.890 --> 00:12:14.560 align:middle line:84%
All this going on to
essentially subdue free-thinking

00:12:14.560 --> 00:12:17.380 align:middle line:84%
and openness and I
would like to know

00:12:17.380 --> 00:12:19.450 align:middle line:84%
as a remote viewer
and teaching others

00:12:19.450 --> 00:12:21.940 align:middle line:84%
what you saw during
all that period?

00:12:21.940 --> 00:12:25.210 align:middle line:84%
The shutdown wasn't just
a shutdown of economies

00:12:25.210 --> 00:12:27.490 align:middle line:90%
and travel and work.

00:12:27.490 --> 00:12:31.340 align:middle line:10%
I think there was a huge
psychic shutdown on some levels.

00:12:31.340 --> 00:12:33.340 align:middle line:10%
>>MCNAMARA: Well, I can
speak personally to that

00:12:33.340 --> 00:12:37.380 align:middle line:10%
and say yeah, for me
all of that pressure,

00:12:37.380 --> 00:12:42.530 align:middle line:10%
it puts a darkness over
the mind, a heaviness,

00:12:42.530 --> 00:12:46.358 align:middle line:10%
and it restricts us to
being more survivalists.

00:12:46.358 --> 00:12:47.900 align:middle line:10%
It gets to the base
part of our brain

00:12:47.900 --> 00:12:50.880 align:middle line:10%
where we're
concerned with what's

00:12:50.880 --> 00:12:53.080 align:middle line:10%
my life going to be
tomorrow, a week from now,

00:12:53.080 --> 00:12:54.360 align:middle line:10%
a month from now?

00:12:54.360 --> 00:12:57.720 align:middle line:10%
How much freedom do I have?

00:12:57.720 --> 00:12:59.850 align:middle line:84%
Am I going to get
sick, or people

00:12:59.850 --> 00:13:01.080 align:middle line:90%
I love going to get sick?

00:13:01.080 --> 00:13:03.760 align:middle line:90%


00:13:03.760 --> 00:13:05.600 align:middle line:84%
And it's political,
it's commercial,

00:13:05.600 --> 00:13:07.730 align:middle line:84%
it's everything,
all this pressure.

00:13:07.730 --> 00:13:11.620 align:middle line:84%
So what is that doing to
the chemicals in our brain,

00:13:11.620 --> 00:13:14.800 align:middle line:84%
to the neurotransmitters,
the stress hormones?

00:13:14.800 --> 00:13:18.130 align:middle line:84%
These are not states that are
conducive to being psychically

00:13:18.130 --> 00:13:21.625 align:middle line:84%
open or to even thinking
clearly on a basic level.

00:13:21.625 --> 00:13:22.750 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: That's the thing.

00:13:22.750 --> 00:13:25.600 align:middle line:84%
It leaves us absolutely
open to manipulation.

00:13:25.600 --> 00:13:27.760 align:middle line:10%
And we all know
now through films

00:13:27.760 --> 00:13:29.890 align:middle line:10%
such as, I mean,
I consider "Social

00:13:29.890 --> 00:13:34.030 align:middle line:10%
Dilemma" an absolute must-see
film because it talks about how

00:13:34.030 --> 00:13:36.940 align:middle line:10%
the algorithms that are
pervasive in our world today

00:13:36.940 --> 00:13:39.130 align:middle line:10%
manipulate consciousness.

00:13:39.130 --> 00:13:41.990 align:middle line:10%
But there are others
we can watch as well

00:13:41.990 --> 00:13:45.760 align:middle line:10%
and other people that have
done a good study in terms

00:13:45.760 --> 00:13:48.850 align:middle line:10%
of algorithm's effect
on our mental processing

00:13:48.850 --> 00:13:50.990 align:middle line:10%
and it is terrible.

00:13:50.990 --> 00:13:52.610 align:middle line:84%
I mean, it's
absolutely terrible.

00:13:52.610 --> 00:13:55.567 align:middle line:84%
And so here we have all this
incoming, so we're shut down,

00:13:55.567 --> 00:13:57.400 align:middle line:84%
we're not intuitive,
we're grasping anywhere

00:13:57.400 --> 00:14:01.360 align:middle line:84%
for anything that is going to
help us feel a sense of safety

00:14:01.360 --> 00:14:03.695 align:middle line:90%
and we're being manipulated.

00:14:03.695 --> 00:14:06.130 align:middle line:84%
>>MCNAMARA: There are
people highly educated

00:14:06.130 --> 00:14:08.515 align:middle line:84%
with a lot of resources who
know how the brain works.

00:14:08.515 --> 00:14:10.120 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Absolutely.

00:14:10.120 --> 00:14:13.400 align:middle line:10%
And that stuff has been going
on for many, many decades now

00:14:13.400 --> 00:14:15.790 align:middle line:10%
and this was kind of
the piaz de resistance,

00:14:15.790 --> 00:14:18.400 align:middle line:10%
the whole world's in fear.

00:14:18.400 --> 00:14:20.200 align:middle line:90%
So we know what that felt like.

00:14:20.200 --> 00:14:22.570 align:middle line:84%
A lot of people became
very, very depressed

00:14:22.570 --> 00:14:25.330 align:middle line:84%
during this period of
time, very isolated.

00:14:25.330 --> 00:14:28.940 align:middle line:84%
So now we're coming
out of all of that.

00:14:28.940 --> 00:14:31.060 align:middle line:84%
And what are you seeing
happen to people's psyche

00:14:31.060 --> 00:14:33.500 align:middle line:90%
because you train these people?

00:14:33.500 --> 00:14:38.740 align:middle line:84%
>>MCNAMARA: Well, so individual
because people are different

00:14:38.740 --> 00:14:39.910 align:middle line:90%
stratas of society.

00:14:39.910 --> 00:14:42.470 align:middle line:84%
Some people are going to
be struggling for decades,

00:14:42.470 --> 00:14:43.270 align:middle line:90%
if not longer.

00:14:43.270 --> 00:14:47.688 align:middle line:84%
Some people are going to recover
a lot faster than that, bad.

00:14:47.688 --> 00:14:49.480 align:middle line:84%
It seem there for a
little while that there

00:14:49.480 --> 00:14:52.270 align:middle line:84%
was some glimmer of hope, some
light, now there's Ukraine.

00:14:52.270 --> 00:14:53.170 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:14:53.170 --> 00:14:55.785 align:middle line:84%
Well, that's all,
you know, yeah.

00:14:55.785 --> 00:14:57.160 align:middle line:84%
God always have
a disaster going.

00:14:57.160 --> 00:14:58.270 align:middle line:84%
>>MCNAMARA: There's
always something to--

00:14:58.270 --> 00:14:59.680 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Not to minimize
the suffering at all

00:14:59.680 --> 00:15:01.200 align:middle line:84%
but got to keep
a disaster going.

00:15:01.200 --> 00:15:03.170 align:middle line:84%
>>MCNAMARA: There's
something going on.

00:15:03.170 --> 00:15:07.670 align:middle line:84%
So it's really difficult,
but for anyone who can,

00:15:07.670 --> 00:15:11.960 align:middle line:84%
there are ways to find
your pocket of calm.

00:15:11.960 --> 00:15:15.050 align:middle line:84%
And some people meditate,
some people pray.

00:15:15.050 --> 00:15:17.120 align:middle line:84%
Practicing psychic
abilities I think

00:15:17.120 --> 00:15:19.130 align:middle line:84%
are on par with
meditation and prayer

00:15:19.130 --> 00:15:22.310 align:middle line:84%
because we have to go within,
we have to set time aside

00:15:22.310 --> 00:15:26.810 align:middle line:84%
to work with our mind to achieve
a relaxed state of mind which

00:15:26.810 --> 00:15:28.220 align:middle line:90%
you can do.

00:15:28.220 --> 00:15:30.020 align:middle line:84%
Even if the world
is going crazy,

00:15:30.020 --> 00:15:32.990 align:middle line:84%
if you work at it
regularly, you can

00:15:32.990 --> 00:15:36.540 align:middle line:84%
train the mind to enter a
relaxed state and then open up.

00:15:36.540 --> 00:15:40.070 align:middle line:84%
So not only are you connecting
with your larger self or larger

00:15:40.070 --> 00:15:41.750 align:middle line:84%
reality but you're
also retrieving

00:15:41.750 --> 00:15:43.310 align:middle line:84%
some of your own
discernment, just

00:15:43.310 --> 00:15:46.160 align:middle line:84%
creating a pocket of
stillness so that you

00:15:46.160 --> 00:15:48.650 align:middle line:84%
can think independently
of what you're

00:15:48.650 --> 00:15:53.520 align:middle line:84%
seeing on social media
or TV or anywhere else.

00:15:53.520 --> 00:15:57.170 align:middle line:84%
So clear thinking, people
can find that space

00:15:57.170 --> 00:16:01.790 align:middle line:84%
within themselves even
today and protocols

00:16:01.790 --> 00:16:04.670 align:middle line:84%
like remote viewing or different
types of meditation and prayer

00:16:04.670 --> 00:16:05.870 align:middle line:90%
do that for you.

00:16:05.870 --> 00:16:09.530 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So how do you
cut through the programming

00:16:09.530 --> 00:16:15.560 align:middle line:84%
and start developing
your psychic abilities

00:16:15.560 --> 00:16:18.230 align:middle line:90%
such as remote viewing?

00:16:18.230 --> 00:16:20.720 align:middle line:84%
I mean, you have courses on
this where people can come

00:16:20.720 --> 00:16:22.100 align:middle line:90%
and they experiment.

00:16:22.100 --> 00:16:24.410 align:middle line:84%
Let's talk about how that
goes just from a formal point

00:16:24.410 --> 00:16:26.655 align:middle line:84%
of view because I think
people are creative,

00:16:26.655 --> 00:16:28.280 align:middle line:84%
our audience is quite
creative and they

00:16:28.280 --> 00:16:31.160 align:middle line:84%
can see how they can maybe
play with this a little bit

00:16:31.160 --> 00:16:32.150 align:middle line:90%
even on their own.

00:16:32.150 --> 00:16:34.700 align:middle line:84%
And I'll share an inadvertent
experiment my husband

00:16:34.700 --> 00:16:38.780 align:middle line:84%
and I just did to show
how simple it can be.

00:16:38.780 --> 00:16:40.760 align:middle line:84%
So first of all
in remote viewing,

00:16:40.760 --> 00:16:42.890 align:middle line:84%
you're not the one
choosing the target

00:16:42.890 --> 00:16:46.490 align:middle line:84%
because you want to cut those
emotional expectations and ties

00:16:46.490 --> 00:16:48.080 align:middle line:90%
which can skew the outcome.

00:16:48.080 --> 00:16:49.095 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHTER]

00:16:49.095 --> 00:16:50.720 align:middle line:84%
>>MCNAMARA: Yeah,
it's really important

00:16:50.720 --> 00:16:54.500 align:middle line:84%
to be clear about the labels we
use because remote viewing uses

00:16:54.500 --> 00:16:56.840 align:middle line:84%
clairvoyance and everyone is
familiar with clairvoyance.

00:16:56.840 --> 00:16:59.300 align:middle line:84%
But clairvoyance can
happen spontaneously

00:16:59.300 --> 00:17:01.760 align:middle line:84%
and a person can choose
to perceive something

00:17:01.760 --> 00:17:03.260 align:middle line:84%
that they're
interested in that way.

00:17:03.260 --> 00:17:07.660 align:middle line:84%
But with remote viewing,
it's deliberate.

00:17:07.660 --> 00:17:09.530 align:middle line:84%
You choose a time
you're going to do it.

00:17:09.530 --> 00:17:12.740 align:middle line:84%
There's a tasker who has
the target to be perceived

00:17:12.740 --> 00:17:15.710 align:middle line:84%
but the viewer doesn't
know what that is.

00:17:15.710 --> 00:17:19.290 align:middle line:84%
And then you assign
a symbol to that.

00:17:19.290 --> 00:17:21.920 align:middle line:84%
And in this case, it's
usually a coordinate number

00:17:21.920 --> 00:17:23.720 align:middle line:90%
or a target reference number.

00:17:23.720 --> 00:17:26.630 align:middle line:84%
Four, six, or eight digits
randomly selected, all they do

00:17:26.630 --> 00:17:29.400 align:middle line:90%
is represent the target.

00:17:29.400 --> 00:17:31.643 align:middle line:84%
You sit down, the
remote viewer enters

00:17:31.643 --> 00:17:33.060 align:middle line:84%
what's called the
Cool Down, which

00:17:33.060 --> 00:17:35.880 align:middle line:84%
is a relaxing state,
a meditative state,

00:17:35.880 --> 00:17:38.890 align:middle line:90%
a state of openness and quiet.

00:17:38.890 --> 00:17:41.360 align:middle line:84%
And some people
do it very quickly

00:17:41.360 --> 00:17:43.090 align:middle line:84%
and some people take
their time doing it.

00:17:43.090 --> 00:17:44.980 align:middle line:84%
But in either case,
you're cutting

00:17:44.980 --> 00:17:49.270 align:middle line:84%
through the noise of the mind,
entering a different state

00:17:49.270 --> 00:17:51.780 align:middle line:90%
of perception.

00:17:51.780 --> 00:17:53.880 align:middle line:84%
And then they send
their intention

00:17:53.880 --> 00:17:56.620 align:middle line:90%
out to perceive the target.

00:17:56.620 --> 00:17:58.000 align:middle line:84%
And there are
different protocols

00:17:58.000 --> 00:17:59.625 align:middle line:84%
as to what you write
down in the paper,

00:17:59.625 --> 00:18:01.510 align:middle line:84%
but it can be very
organic where you just

00:18:01.510 --> 00:18:06.330 align:middle line:84%
start writing down what comes
to you from any of the senses.

00:18:06.330 --> 00:18:09.730 align:middle line:10%
It can be visual imagery.

00:18:09.730 --> 00:18:14.080 align:middle line:84%
It could be sound, smell,
taste, emotional qualities,

00:18:14.080 --> 00:18:15.210 align:middle line:90%
or ambiance.

00:18:15.210 --> 00:18:20.290 align:middle line:84%
Any of that can be written
down and described on paper.

00:18:20.290 --> 00:18:23.290 align:middle line:84%
And perhaps the most important
part is the feedback.

00:18:23.290 --> 00:18:26.740 align:middle line:84%
That's the part at the end where
the remote viewer has actually

00:18:26.740 --> 00:18:30.620 align:middle line:84%
shown what the target was so
they can verify that they were

00:18:30.620 --> 00:18:33.040 align:middle line:90%
in fact perceiving the target.

00:18:33.040 --> 00:18:34.810 align:middle line:84%
And they can learn
from the experience

00:18:34.810 --> 00:18:36.525 align:middle line:90%
how accurate were they.

00:18:36.525 --> 00:18:37.540 align:middle line:90%
What were their hits?

00:18:37.540 --> 00:18:38.665 align:middle line:90%
What did they connect with?

00:18:38.665 --> 00:18:40.210 align:middle line:90%
What did they miss completely?

00:18:40.210 --> 00:18:42.105 align:middle line:84%
And what other
noise was occurring?

00:18:42.105 --> 00:18:43.480 align:middle line:84%
What did they
write down that had

00:18:43.480 --> 00:18:44.680 align:middle line:90%
nothing to do with the target?

00:18:44.680 --> 00:18:45.040 align:middle line:90%
Where did it come from?

00:18:45.040 --> 00:18:47.170 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Where my
thought have intervened.

00:18:47.170 --> 00:18:52.750 align:middle line:84%
But fear is the big
challenger to most people,

00:18:52.750 --> 00:18:56.030 align:middle line:84%
a fear of being wrong where
the ego steps in, right?

00:18:56.030 --> 00:18:56.830 align:middle line:90%
>>MCNAMARA: Yeah.

00:18:56.830 --> 00:18:58.660 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So let's
talk about that part

00:18:58.660 --> 00:19:01.960 align:middle line:84%
of how you train people
to tell the ego, you know,

00:19:01.960 --> 00:19:05.050 align:middle line:84%
just sit down and
watch for a while.

00:19:05.050 --> 00:19:06.140 align:middle line:90%
Just sit this one out.

00:19:06.140 --> 00:19:08.400 align:middle line:90%
Give me a little space.

00:19:08.400 --> 00:19:09.265 align:middle line:90%
How do you do that?

00:19:09.265 --> 00:19:10.390 align:middle line:90%
How do you teach them that?

00:19:10.390 --> 00:19:13.690 align:middle line:84%
>>MCNAMARA: Well, there
are two different processes

00:19:13.690 --> 00:19:14.570 align:middle line:90%
that happen.

00:19:14.570 --> 00:19:15.820 align:middle line:90%
One is very natural.

00:19:15.820 --> 00:19:19.060 align:middle line:84%
Usually, they're on their
first or second attempt.

00:19:19.060 --> 00:19:21.100 align:middle line:84%
New viewers do really
well because they

00:19:21.100 --> 00:19:22.750 align:middle line:90%
have no expectations.

00:19:22.750 --> 00:19:25.650 align:middle line:84%
Then they try and match it or
that's where the fear comes in.

00:19:25.650 --> 00:19:27.130 align:middle line:90%
What's really happening here?

00:19:27.130 --> 00:19:29.283 align:middle line:90%
And their results go down.

00:19:29.283 --> 00:19:31.450 align:middle line:84%
And that's when the work
really happens because they

00:19:31.450 --> 00:19:32.510 align:middle line:90%
have to come out of that.

00:19:32.510 --> 00:19:34.900 align:middle line:84%
And that's when working
with the Cool Down

00:19:34.900 --> 00:19:38.200 align:middle line:84%
is really important, and
different breathing techniques,

00:19:38.200 --> 00:19:41.440 align:middle line:90%
just basically breathing deeply.

00:19:41.440 --> 00:19:44.230 align:middle line:84%
There's a technique of
just dropping the head

00:19:44.230 --> 00:19:46.310 align:middle line:84%
and that compresses
the arteries here.

00:19:46.310 --> 00:19:47.770 align:middle line:90%
It slows down your pulse.

00:19:47.770 --> 00:19:51.280 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: You went into some
really classic literature

00:19:51.280 --> 00:19:55.030 align:middle line:84%
and such when you were studying
all the processes by which

00:19:55.030 --> 00:19:59.410 align:middle line:84%
people can go down into
that cooling state with more

00:19:59.410 --> 00:20:00.580 align:middle line:90%
ease and more efficiency.

00:20:00.580 --> 00:20:02.530 align:middle line:84%
>>MCNAMARA: Well, I
learned about a man named

00:20:02.530 --> 00:20:05.830 align:middle line:90%
Milan Ryzl from Czechoslovakia.

00:20:05.830 --> 00:20:08.110 align:middle line:84%
He would use hypnosis
with his subjects.

00:20:08.110 --> 00:20:11.500 align:middle line:84%
And they actually won the
Czech lottery multiple times

00:20:11.500 --> 00:20:12.520 align:middle line:90%
using this technique.

00:20:12.520 --> 00:20:14.270 align:middle line:84%
And he ended up having
to leave because he

00:20:14.270 --> 00:20:17.450 align:middle line:84%
was being under close
watch by his government.

00:20:17.450 --> 00:20:18.880 align:middle line:90%
So he had to leave.

00:20:18.880 --> 00:20:20.500 align:middle line:84%
But I found one
of his books where

00:20:20.500 --> 00:20:23.530 align:middle line:84%
he talks about the hypnotic
techniques he uses.

00:20:23.530 --> 00:20:26.830 align:middle line:84%
And so often when I work with
students or with my friends

00:20:26.830 --> 00:20:30.160 align:middle line:84%
I'll use hypnotic techniques
during the cool-down phase.

00:20:30.160 --> 00:20:33.400 align:middle line:84%
The hypnosis is really just a
state of altered consciousness

00:20:33.400 --> 00:20:37.030 align:middle line:84%
and relaxation and entering
an alpha state, maybe even

00:20:37.030 --> 00:20:39.860 align:middle line:84%
a theta state if you
go deeper than that.

00:20:39.860 --> 00:20:43.330 align:middle line:84%
So he's a researcher,
a practitioner

00:20:43.330 --> 00:20:47.000 align:middle line:90%
who I really rely on his work.

00:20:47.000 --> 00:20:51.880 align:middle line:84%
And I enjoy working with
other resources from the past

00:20:51.880 --> 00:20:54.640 align:middle line:84%
because there's so many
valuable scientists who

00:20:54.640 --> 00:20:56.830 align:middle line:90%
we need to remember their work.

00:20:56.830 --> 00:20:59.355 align:middle line:84%
There is a Russian whose
last name was Vasilyev

00:20:59.355 --> 00:21:00.730 align:middle line:84%
and he did some
interesting work.

00:21:00.730 --> 00:21:02.105 align:middle line:84%
This connects to
the conversation

00:21:02.105 --> 00:21:04.290 align:middle line:90%
we had about the body.

00:21:04.290 --> 00:21:06.930 align:middle line:90%
And this was about telepathy.

00:21:06.930 --> 00:21:11.070 align:middle line:84%
There would be a subject
in one room told to draw,

00:21:11.070 --> 00:21:15.450 align:middle line:84%
to view basically what this
other person would be drawing

00:21:15.450 --> 00:21:17.130 align:middle line:84%
on a piece of paper,
but the viewer

00:21:17.130 --> 00:21:20.190 align:middle line:84%
was given a planchette
so this board on wheels

00:21:20.190 --> 00:21:22.000 align:middle line:90%
with a pencil stuck through it.

00:21:22.000 --> 00:21:24.187 align:middle line:84%
And they would just
move the planchette--

00:21:24.187 --> 00:21:26.270 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Which is which
you use on a Ouija board?

00:21:26.270 --> 00:21:26.670 align:middle line:90%
>>MCNAMARA: Exactly.

00:21:26.670 --> 00:21:28.378 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: That it had
a hole in a pencil?

00:21:28.378 --> 00:21:31.020 align:middle line:84%
>>MCNAMARA: And they would
just let her arms move

00:21:31.020 --> 00:21:33.720 align:middle line:84%
so their body is
communicating the information

00:21:33.720 --> 00:21:35.413 align:middle line:84%
and they would do
the drawing that way.

00:21:35.413 --> 00:21:36.330 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Interesting.

00:21:36.330 --> 00:21:38.850 align:middle line:84%
>>MCNAMARA: And I was so
inspired by that experiment

00:21:38.850 --> 00:21:42.600 align:middle line:84%
that I thought maybe we
can do something similar

00:21:42.600 --> 00:21:43.950 align:middle line:90%
but without a planchette.

00:21:43.950 --> 00:21:47.600 align:middle line:84%
So what I did was through
these series of experiments

00:21:47.600 --> 00:21:52.320 align:middle line:84%
I asked my viewers,
try and feel what

00:21:52.320 --> 00:21:54.330 align:middle line:84%
you'll be drawing when
you get your feedback.

00:21:54.330 --> 00:21:57.250 align:middle line:84%
So they would do their viewing
session in the present moment,

00:21:57.250 --> 00:21:59.700 align:middle line:84%
but let's go to the
future and that they're

00:21:59.700 --> 00:22:04.440 align:middle line:84%
given their feedback image
in a piece of tracing paper,

00:22:04.440 --> 00:22:07.840 align:middle line:84%
and then they would
trace the picture.

00:22:07.840 --> 00:22:10.710 align:middle line:84%
So in the future, they're
moving their hand and arm

00:22:10.710 --> 00:22:11.910 align:middle line:90%
a certain way.

00:22:11.910 --> 00:22:13.740 align:middle line:10%
But now back to
the viewing moment,

00:22:13.740 --> 00:22:17.050 align:middle line:10%
I said, instead of just remote
viewing the ordinary way,

00:22:17.050 --> 00:22:20.310 align:middle line:10%
try and just feel while
your arms and hands are

00:22:20.310 --> 00:22:23.550 align:middle line:10%
doing in the future as you're
tracing over the target image.

00:22:23.550 --> 00:22:24.900 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Interesting.

00:22:24.900 --> 00:22:27.555 align:middle line:84%
>>MCNAMARA: And they did it and
the results were astounding.

00:22:27.555 --> 00:22:29.472 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So this was
viewing into the future?

00:22:29.472 --> 00:22:32.340 align:middle line:84%
>>MCNAMARA: They're viewing
themselves in the future.

00:22:32.340 --> 00:22:33.630 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Exactly.

00:22:33.630 --> 00:22:35.820 align:middle line:90%
Now that's interesting.

00:22:35.820 --> 00:22:39.850 align:middle line:10%
And I brought this up before,
and so a couple of people

00:22:39.850 --> 00:22:41.100 align:middle line:10%
watching may have heard of it.

00:22:41.100 --> 00:22:45.090 align:middle line:84%
But what happened
was the big reveal

00:22:45.090 --> 00:22:48.570 align:middle line:84%
in the famous Soviet-American
remote viewing

00:22:48.570 --> 00:22:53.790 align:middle line:84%
experiment before the Iron
Curtain, before that all fell,

00:22:53.790 --> 00:22:56.220 align:middle line:84%
and that was what Russell
Targ was involved in.

00:22:56.220 --> 00:23:00.240 align:middle line:84%
Lot of witnesses, really
good remote viewer

00:23:00.240 --> 00:23:02.140 align:middle line:90%
who was also a healer.

00:23:02.140 --> 00:23:03.840 align:middle line:90%
She was a healer first.

00:23:03.840 --> 00:23:07.935 align:middle line:84%
And even the Soviet Academy
of Sciences was present.

00:23:07.935 --> 00:23:09.060 align:middle line:90%
The whole thing was filmed.

00:23:09.060 --> 00:23:10.920 align:middle line:84%
I saw the film right
when they got back.

00:23:10.920 --> 00:23:13.290 align:middle line:84%
And it was an
extraordinary session.

00:23:13.290 --> 00:23:16.530 align:middle line:84%
She was right on with everything
she drew for the target, which

00:23:16.530 --> 00:23:20.370 align:middle line:84%
was the merry-go-round at
Pier 39 in San Francisco,

00:23:20.370 --> 00:23:23.250 align:middle line:84%
right down to animals with
glass eyes and water right off

00:23:23.250 --> 00:23:24.670 align:middle line:90%
and she got it.

00:23:24.670 --> 00:23:26.820 align:middle line:84%
But the interesting
thing was that target

00:23:26.820 --> 00:23:28.260 align:middle line:90%
wasn't chosen for another.

00:23:28.260 --> 00:23:32.340 align:middle line:84%
It was either three or four
hours after she viewed it.

00:23:32.340 --> 00:23:34.950 align:middle line:84%
And I've noticed this too
even with myself going out

00:23:34.950 --> 00:23:38.400 align:middle line:84%
with Steven Greer and such
when you view into the future

00:23:38.400 --> 00:23:41.640 align:middle line:84%
how clean and clear it can be
and this is what you notice.

00:23:41.640 --> 00:23:44.842 align:middle line:90%
Why is that?

00:23:44.842 --> 00:23:46.800 align:middle line:84%
>>MCNAMARA: Why people
can see into the future?

00:23:46.800 --> 00:23:48.010 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: So clearly.

00:23:48.010 --> 00:23:50.530 align:middle line:84%
I mean, it's almost like
it's less obstructed

00:23:50.530 --> 00:23:52.240 align:middle line:90%
in a way than the present.

00:23:52.240 --> 00:23:55.870 align:middle line:84%
>>MCNAMARA: Well, I think it has
a way of minimizing the ego's

00:23:55.870 --> 00:23:57.490 align:middle line:90%
impact on the experiment.

00:23:57.490 --> 00:24:00.910 align:middle line:84%
Because there's that
psychological distance where

00:24:00.910 --> 00:24:02.830 align:middle line:84%
if it's something
happened in the present

00:24:02.830 --> 00:24:04.780 align:middle line:84%
that you're trying to perceive,
there's a lot of pressure

00:24:04.780 --> 00:24:05.580 align:middle line:90%
there.

00:24:05.580 --> 00:24:08.230 align:middle line:84%
This is happening
right now, draw it,

00:24:08.230 --> 00:24:10.755 align:middle line:90%
versus something in the future.

00:24:10.755 --> 00:24:12.130 align:middle line:84%
There's a sense
of less pressure.

00:24:12.130 --> 00:24:14.620 align:middle line:90%
They're seems looser in a way.

00:24:14.620 --> 00:24:15.420 align:middle line:90%
It's nuanced.

00:24:15.420 --> 00:24:16.405 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: It's more of a game.

00:24:16.405 --> 00:24:17.738 align:middle line:90%
>>MCNAMARA: It's more of a game.

00:24:17.738 --> 00:24:19.810 align:middle line:84%
So it's more fun
and there's always

00:24:19.810 --> 00:24:22.802 align:middle line:84%
that idea of who's seeing into
the future, and it's been up--

00:24:22.802 --> 00:24:24.760 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: You almost let
yourself off the hook.

00:24:24.760 --> 00:24:27.280 align:middle line:84%
Your ego can get out of
the way because you're not

00:24:27.280 --> 00:24:30.040 align:middle line:84%
expecting to be right and
it's just a game of sorts.

00:24:30.040 --> 00:24:32.380 align:middle line:84%
>>MCNAMARA: And
there's a connection

00:24:32.380 --> 00:24:38.990 align:middle line:84%
about taking yourself
off the hook and peace.

00:24:38.990 --> 00:24:44.000 align:middle line:84%
So the more a person can relax
and just let go of the pressure

00:24:44.000 --> 00:24:46.100 align:middle line:84%
and be open to
anything that enters

00:24:46.100 --> 00:24:50.320 align:middle line:84%
the mind during a
viewing session,

00:24:50.320 --> 00:24:55.030 align:middle line:84%
trusting their own perceptions,
trusting their own mind,

00:24:55.030 --> 00:24:59.157 align:middle line:84%
and putting it down and having
that game component to it.

00:24:59.157 --> 00:25:00.490 align:middle line:90%
What's going to come to my mind?

00:25:00.490 --> 00:25:03.970 align:middle line:84%
The target could be
anything in the world that

00:25:03.970 --> 00:25:04.910 align:middle line:90%
could be verified.

00:25:04.910 --> 00:25:05.710 align:middle line:90%
Anything.

00:25:05.710 --> 00:25:11.070 align:middle line:84%
So as Russell Targ says,
draw whatever strange things

00:25:11.070 --> 00:25:12.760 align:middle line:90%
occurring in your mind.

00:25:12.760 --> 00:25:14.800 align:middle line:84%
And so people can
be true to that,

00:25:14.800 --> 00:25:17.620 align:middle line:90%
their results are usually great.

00:25:17.620 --> 00:25:22.540 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So let's go into the
notion of why it's not good.

00:25:22.540 --> 00:25:25.840 align:middle line:84%
People like to learn
various skills and think,

00:25:25.840 --> 00:25:29.590 align:middle line:84%
OK, I'm going to use this
to spy on my boyfriend

00:25:29.590 --> 00:25:31.120 align:middle line:84%
this weekend
because he went away

00:25:31.120 --> 00:25:32.380 align:middle line:90%
and I don't know where he is.

00:25:32.380 --> 00:25:34.510 align:middle line:84%
Let's just say
some woman is going

00:25:34.510 --> 00:25:35.960 align:middle line:90%
to do something like that.

00:25:35.960 --> 00:25:36.760 align:middle line:90%
>>MCNAMARA: Sure.

00:25:36.760 --> 00:25:39.392 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Let's talk about
why that's not a good idea.

00:25:39.392 --> 00:25:41.950 align:middle line:84%
>>MCNAMARA: It's difficult
because the mind is always

00:25:41.950 --> 00:25:45.940 align:middle line:84%
filled with about 1,000
different ideas and feelings

00:25:45.940 --> 00:25:46.912 align:middle line:90%
and images.

00:25:46.912 --> 00:25:48.370 align:middle line:84%
And if you set up
your own targets,

00:25:48.370 --> 00:25:50.740 align:middle line:84%
if you want to find
out if your partner is

00:25:50.740 --> 00:25:52.270 align:middle line:90%
cheating on you at the moment.

00:25:52.270 --> 00:25:54.910 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Or he loves me, he
loves me not into the future,

00:25:54.910 --> 00:25:55.710 align:middle line:90%
right?

00:25:55.710 --> 00:25:56.620 align:middle line:90%
>>MCNAMARA: Yeah.

00:25:56.620 --> 00:25:59.470 align:middle line:84%
Usually, your deepest
fears are what's really

00:25:59.470 --> 00:26:00.820 align:middle line:90%
going to enter your mind.

00:26:00.820 --> 00:26:03.395 align:middle line:84%
And you might read it as
oh, I'm clearly seeing

00:26:03.395 --> 00:26:04.520 align:middle line:90%
something that's occurring.

00:26:04.520 --> 00:26:09.190 align:middle line:84%
No, you're clearly seeing that
part of your mind that's scared

00:26:09.190 --> 00:26:11.390 align:middle line:90%
or that doesn't want to be hurt.

00:26:11.390 --> 00:26:14.800 align:middle line:84%
There's a connection
between psychic abilities

00:26:14.800 --> 00:26:16.750 align:middle line:90%
and self-preservation.

00:26:16.750 --> 00:26:19.747 align:middle line:84%
I think this is part of how it's
developed in the human race--

00:26:19.747 --> 00:26:20.830 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Talk about that.

00:26:20.830 --> 00:26:23.455 align:middle line:84%
>>MCNAMARA: --where it could be
used as a form of communication

00:26:23.455 --> 00:26:27.130 align:middle line:84%
or we could put this in context
of shamanistic societies,

00:26:27.130 --> 00:26:33.850 align:middle line:84%
where if you have a day or
two to find the nearest herd

00:26:33.850 --> 00:26:34.855 align:middle line:90%
of reindeer--

00:26:34.855 --> 00:26:36.363 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Or water or whatever.

00:26:36.363 --> 00:26:37.780 align:middle line:84%
>>MCNAMARA: --or
buffalo or water,

00:26:37.780 --> 00:26:41.290 align:middle line:84%
you can't spend that time
cruising through 10 valleys

00:26:41.290 --> 00:26:42.550 align:middle line:90%
looking for those resources.

00:26:42.550 --> 00:26:45.710 align:middle line:84%
You have to find it now
for the tribe to survive.

00:26:45.710 --> 00:26:51.640 align:middle line:84%
So the shaman would travel
with the mind and locate,

00:26:51.640 --> 00:26:54.115 align:middle line:84%
and then they can use
their energetic resources,

00:26:54.115 --> 00:26:57.220 align:middle line:84%
you know, food and time
to go find them and do

00:26:57.220 --> 00:26:59.950 align:middle line:84%
the hunting or gathering,
what they need to do.

00:26:59.950 --> 00:27:03.190 align:middle line:84%
So we're deciding
where is danger

00:27:03.190 --> 00:27:05.080 align:middle line:84%
or if a tribe is
coming to attack.

00:27:05.080 --> 00:27:08.690 align:middle line:90%


00:27:08.690 --> 00:27:11.330 align:middle line:84%
1,000 years ago, how would
you retrieve that information?

00:27:11.330 --> 00:27:14.260 align:middle line:84%
It would be through
psychic perception,

00:27:14.260 --> 00:27:17.150 align:middle line:90%
and that was all about survival.

00:27:17.150 --> 00:27:18.580 align:middle line:90%
So they're crucial.

00:27:18.580 --> 00:27:20.860 align:middle line:84%
And of course, there's
this process of elimination

00:27:20.860 --> 00:27:22.870 align:middle line:84%
that the ones who did
a really good job at it

00:27:22.870 --> 00:27:25.690 align:middle line:90%
kept their jobs, so to speak.

00:27:25.690 --> 00:27:29.110 align:middle line:84%
And then the ones who
didn't, their survival odds

00:27:29.110 --> 00:27:30.850 align:middle line:90%
went down drastically.

00:27:30.850 --> 00:27:32.850 align:middle line:84%
So there's this filtration
process all the time.

00:27:32.850 --> 00:27:35.710 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So you have
actual communal survival

00:27:35.710 --> 00:27:37.810 align:middle line:84%
and people who are highly
skilled and connected

00:27:37.810 --> 00:27:39.100 align:middle line:90%
with nature.

00:27:39.100 --> 00:27:40.960 align:middle line:84%
Now you have a
modern-day situation

00:27:40.960 --> 00:27:45.910 align:middle line:84%
where it's your ego or emotional
survival that's often at stake.

00:27:45.910 --> 00:27:48.970 align:middle line:84%
I know a lot of people
that use divination

00:27:48.970 --> 00:27:50.680 align:middle line:84%
and whatever it
is they're trying

00:27:50.680 --> 00:27:54.640 align:middle line:84%
to develop to determine
things like money and love

00:27:54.640 --> 00:27:59.060 align:middle line:90%
and it almost never goes right.

00:27:59.060 --> 00:28:02.980 align:middle line:84%
They give themselves so much
misinformation so often.

00:28:02.980 --> 00:28:06.220 align:middle line:90%
And again, it's based in fear--

00:28:06.220 --> 00:28:10.900 align:middle line:84%
fear of rejection,
abandonment, lack, and whatnot.

00:28:10.900 --> 00:28:12.460 align:middle line:84%
>>MCNAMARA: There
are ways where you

00:28:12.460 --> 00:28:16.860 align:middle line:84%
could work with a
friend or a loved one,

00:28:16.860 --> 00:28:20.280 align:middle line:84%
they're not as challenging
but you can do it.

00:28:20.280 --> 00:28:22.950 align:middle line:84%
Let's say with your
spouse, your spouse

00:28:22.950 --> 00:28:25.470 align:middle line:84%
knows 5 or 10
questions you're caring

00:28:25.470 --> 00:28:28.770 align:middle line:84%
about your personal life,
your professional life,

00:28:28.770 --> 00:28:30.080 align:middle line:90%
and you turn it into a game.

00:28:30.080 --> 00:28:30.930 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:28:30.930 --> 00:28:32.280 align:middle line:90%
Get the ego out of the way.

00:28:32.280 --> 00:28:33.210 align:middle line:84%
>>MCNAMARA: Get the
ego out of the way.

00:28:33.210 --> 00:28:35.670 align:middle line:84%
And then you could designate
one day of the week.

00:28:35.670 --> 00:28:38.370 align:middle line:84%
Sunday afternoons
are our playtime.

00:28:38.370 --> 00:28:43.650 align:middle line:84%
And your spouse writes down
a question pertaining to you

00:28:43.650 --> 00:28:46.020 align:middle line:84%
but you don't know
what that question is.

00:28:46.020 --> 00:28:50.070 align:middle line:84%
And then you or a third
friend, they're the viewer

00:28:50.070 --> 00:28:53.370 align:middle line:84%
or you're the viewer
but you have no idea.

00:28:53.370 --> 00:28:56.700 align:middle line:84%
And they do the viewing related
to the target and the question

00:28:56.700 --> 00:28:57.833 align:middle line:90%
is--

00:28:57.833 --> 00:28:59.250 align:middle line:84%
whatever the
question is, and then

00:28:59.250 --> 00:29:01.652 align:middle line:84%
you compare the transcript
to the question.

00:29:01.652 --> 00:29:03.360 align:middle line:84%
It's probably even
better that you're not

00:29:03.360 --> 00:29:04.860 align:middle line:84%
involved if it's
about you, but you

00:29:04.860 --> 00:29:07.970 align:middle line:84%
have a friend doing the viewing
and someone close to you--

00:29:07.970 --> 00:29:08.970 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: The surrogate.

00:29:08.970 --> 00:29:10.350 align:middle line:84%
>>MCNAMARA: --asking
the question.

00:29:10.350 --> 00:29:12.017 align:middle line:84%
So the target instead
of being a picture

00:29:12.017 --> 00:29:15.750 align:middle line:84%
of a building or
an airline strip,

00:29:15.750 --> 00:29:18.630 align:middle line:84%
it's a question
about your career.

00:29:18.630 --> 00:29:20.100 align:middle line:90%
It could be a--

00:29:20.100 --> 00:29:20.910 align:middle line:90%
well.

00:29:20.910 --> 00:29:21.290 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Whatever.

00:29:21.290 --> 00:29:22.050 align:middle line:90%
>>MCNAMARA: Whatever, but--

00:29:22.050 --> 00:29:23.258 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Something personal.

00:29:23.258 --> 00:29:25.750 align:middle line:84%
>>MCNAMARA: If we have
our own pods of friends

00:29:25.750 --> 00:29:27.330 align:middle line:90%
we can do this for each other.

00:29:27.330 --> 00:29:29.670 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And I think
that's really beautiful.

00:29:29.670 --> 00:29:33.425 align:middle line:84%
I mean, because most
people want to use it

00:29:33.425 --> 00:29:34.800 align:middle line:84%
in ways that are
going to enhance

00:29:34.800 --> 00:29:38.520 align:middle line:84%
their own personal lives or it
keeps them away from trouble

00:29:38.520 --> 00:29:41.140 align:middle line:84%
or making a bad
mistake of some kind.

00:29:41.140 --> 00:29:44.280 align:middle line:84%
And I love the fact that
you're talking about

00:29:44.280 --> 00:29:47.040 align:middle line:84%
that we can be
surrogates because we're

00:29:47.040 --> 00:29:49.440 align:middle line:84%
clearer of the fear
than the person who

00:29:49.440 --> 00:29:52.530 align:middle line:90%
wants the information.

00:29:52.530 --> 00:29:54.420 align:middle line:84%
Do you teach that in
your workshops too?

00:29:54.420 --> 00:29:56.430 align:middle line:84%
>>MCNAMARA: Well, I
have a small group

00:29:56.430 --> 00:29:58.350 align:middle line:84%
of friends who we work
together regularly

00:29:58.350 --> 00:30:00.040 align:middle line:84%
and we've done that
for each other.

00:30:00.040 --> 00:30:03.420 align:middle line:84%
Sometimes the friend
lets me know that hey,

00:30:03.420 --> 00:30:05.850 align:middle line:90%
something's happening.

00:30:05.850 --> 00:30:08.580 align:middle line:84%
And I'll design a question
for the rest of the team,

00:30:08.580 --> 00:30:10.920 align:middle line:84%
for the rest of our
friends to view.

00:30:10.920 --> 00:30:13.320 align:middle line:84%
And they don't even
know who it's for,

00:30:13.320 --> 00:30:15.750 align:middle line:84%
but we do the viewing, and
then there's the information.

00:30:15.750 --> 00:30:17.250 align:middle line:84%
I've also done it
for myself where I

00:30:17.250 --> 00:30:19.920 align:middle line:90%
had a question about this is--

00:30:19.920 --> 00:30:20.790 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHTER]

00:30:20.790 --> 00:30:21.660 align:middle line:90%
--I'll reveal a little bit.

00:30:21.660 --> 00:30:23.640 align:middle line:84%
So I wasn't sure about
which book to work on.

00:30:23.640 --> 00:30:25.350 align:middle line:84%
I'm always writing
something and I--

00:30:25.350 --> 00:30:28.860 align:middle line:84%
which book would be most
successful at the end of 2022?

00:30:28.860 --> 00:30:30.780 align:middle line:84%
I don't remember
what the year was.

00:30:30.780 --> 00:30:33.588 align:middle line:84%
And I asked them if
they would help me

00:30:33.588 --> 00:30:34.630 align:middle line:90%
and they said they would.

00:30:34.630 --> 00:30:36.510 align:middle line:84%
So I asked the
question-- they had

00:30:36.510 --> 00:30:39.570 align:middle line:84%
no idea what my question
was, and the question the way

00:30:39.570 --> 00:30:42.120 align:middle line:84%
I designed it was
please describe

00:30:42.120 --> 00:30:45.840 align:middle line:84%
the contents of
Sean's potential book

00:30:45.840 --> 00:30:49.810 align:middle line:84%
that would be most successful
at the end of this time frame.

00:30:49.810 --> 00:30:51.967 align:middle line:84%
They did their viewing and
they had no idea, again,

00:30:51.967 --> 00:30:53.800 align:middle line:84%
no idea what they were
supposed to be doing,

00:30:53.800 --> 00:30:56.290 align:middle line:84%
what the question
was, and they started

00:30:56.290 --> 00:30:58.570 align:middle line:90%
describing different themes.

00:30:58.570 --> 00:31:00.250 align:middle line:10%
And the results of
their transcripts

00:31:00.250 --> 00:31:02.740 align:middle line:10%
told me which of
my two-book ideas

00:31:02.740 --> 00:31:05.370 align:middle line:10%
I should focus on, which I did.

00:31:05.370 --> 00:31:06.370 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: That's lovely.

00:31:06.370 --> 00:31:07.870 align:middle line:84%
That'd be a wonderful
thing to teach

00:31:07.870 --> 00:31:10.662 align:middle line:84%
people is to how to work
in group with each other

00:31:10.662 --> 00:31:13.120 align:middle line:84%
where you have a few friends
or you have a couple of family

00:31:13.120 --> 00:31:15.040 align:middle line:90%
members that are open to it.

00:31:15.040 --> 00:31:17.650 align:middle line:84%
>>MCNAMARA: And the thing
is everybody's psychic

00:31:17.650 --> 00:31:19.130 align:middle line:90%
to one degree or another.

00:31:19.130 --> 00:31:21.580 align:middle line:84%
And you can practice and
train and develop your ability

00:31:21.580 --> 00:31:25.000 align:middle line:84%
over time, and you don't have
to go to an expensive school

00:31:25.000 --> 00:31:25.990 align:middle line:90%
to learn.

00:31:25.990 --> 00:31:27.970 align:middle line:84%
Basically, what
you've heard here

00:31:27.970 --> 00:31:31.210 align:middle line:84%
so far you can use already
with two or three friends.

00:31:31.210 --> 00:31:35.850 align:middle line:84%
Just design your experiment and
just draw whatever you perceive

00:31:35.850 --> 00:31:39.150 align:middle line:84%
and then compare it to the
question that was asked.

00:31:39.150 --> 00:31:41.460 align:middle line:84%
And of course, the
person who the question

00:31:41.460 --> 00:31:44.780 align:middle line:84%
is for has to determine-- do
I want to follow this advice?

00:31:44.780 --> 00:31:45.605 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:31:45.605 --> 00:31:46.980 align:middle line:84%
Well, that's a
whole other thing.

00:31:46.980 --> 00:31:48.980 align:middle line:84%
That's where the ego can
pop back in by the way.

00:31:48.980 --> 00:31:50.370 align:middle line:90%
>>MCNAMARA: Absolutely.

00:31:50.370 --> 00:31:51.870 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: That's interesting.

00:31:51.870 --> 00:31:54.840 align:middle line:84%
And with our kids because
ideally what we want

00:31:54.840 --> 00:31:58.770 align:middle line:84%
is to start creating societies
again, which is in our future

00:31:58.770 --> 00:32:02.040 align:middle line:84%
from what everybody that has
looked into the future has seen

00:32:02.040 --> 00:32:03.870 align:middle line:90%
we do become telepathic.

00:32:03.870 --> 00:32:06.870 align:middle line:84%
We do move into
a more golden age

00:32:06.870 --> 00:32:09.360 align:middle line:84%
where we can communicate
transparently

00:32:09.360 --> 00:32:11.760 align:middle line:84%
with each other and
through telepathy

00:32:11.760 --> 00:32:14.680 align:middle line:84%
and that starts
with the children.

00:32:14.680 --> 00:32:18.120 align:middle line:84%
And I remember when my
son was little we do,

00:32:18.120 --> 00:32:21.930 align:middle line:84%
which hand is the penny, or
what color am I thinking of,

00:32:21.930 --> 00:32:23.470 align:middle line:90%
and that kind of thing.

00:32:23.470 --> 00:32:25.140 align:middle line:90%
And I mentioned this earlier.

00:32:25.140 --> 00:32:26.850 align:middle line:84%
The other day my
husband and I were

00:32:26.850 --> 00:32:31.020 align:middle line:84%
talking about a famous
mathematical model

00:32:31.020 --> 00:32:32.790 align:middle line:90%
about those game shows.

00:32:32.790 --> 00:32:38.990 align:middle line:84%
You have a car behind one door
and goats behind the other two.

00:32:38.990 --> 00:32:40.170 align:middle line:90%
Do you raise the odds?

00:32:40.170 --> 00:32:44.160 align:middle line:84%
And I thought, well, I'm
not understanding it.

00:32:44.160 --> 00:32:45.958 align:middle line:84%
My mind's still
going in the old way.

00:32:45.958 --> 00:32:48.000 align:middle line:10%
So we were playing a little
game and he said, OK,

00:32:48.000 --> 00:32:51.720 align:middle line:10%
so the three cards.

00:32:51.720 --> 00:32:57.070 align:middle line:84%
The red card is the car and
the black cards are the goats.

00:32:57.070 --> 00:32:57.870 align:middle line:90%
Well, do that.

00:32:57.870 --> 00:32:59.710 align:middle line:84%
You just choose and
see what happens.

00:32:59.710 --> 00:33:05.040 align:middle line:84%
And what happens with me is
when I go into a receptive state

00:33:05.040 --> 00:33:07.600 align:middle line:84%
my bunny ears go up and
everything kicks in.

00:33:07.600 --> 00:33:10.350 align:middle line:84%
So it wasn't realistic
compared to being

00:33:10.350 --> 00:33:14.400 align:middle line:84%
on a stage as a contestant
trying to choose a car that you

00:33:14.400 --> 00:33:15.210 align:middle line:90%
desperately want.

00:33:15.210 --> 00:33:18.630 align:middle line:10%
So I picked six out
of seven red cards.

00:33:18.630 --> 00:33:20.670 align:middle line:10%
I picked the car
each time because I

00:33:20.670 --> 00:33:22.830 align:middle line:10%
was in a receptive
state, so stop it.

00:33:22.830 --> 00:33:23.970 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHTER]

00:33:23.970 --> 00:33:26.940 align:middle line:84%
This isn't reflective of
the mathematical model.

00:33:26.940 --> 00:33:29.430 align:middle line:84%
But again, that gets me
to the next question.

00:33:29.430 --> 00:33:32.250 align:middle line:84%
It was going into this
nice receiver state

00:33:32.250 --> 00:33:36.030 align:middle line:84%
like going out with
CE-5 group and such.

00:33:36.030 --> 00:33:39.090 align:middle line:84%
Some people are better
receivers and some people

00:33:39.090 --> 00:33:40.380 align:middle line:90%
are better senders.

00:33:40.380 --> 00:33:43.020 align:middle line:84%
Let's talk about
the energetic mode

00:33:43.020 --> 00:33:45.222 align:middle line:84%
you need to be in
for each of those.

00:33:45.222 --> 00:33:46.680 align:middle line:84%
>>MCNAMARA: That's
a great question

00:33:46.680 --> 00:33:49.560 align:middle line:84%
because there are
different modes for both.

00:33:49.560 --> 00:33:55.470 align:middle line:84%
And I read a book once
by Andrija Puharich

00:33:55.470 --> 00:33:58.590 align:middle line:84%
called "Beyond Telepathy" where
he discussed some experiments

00:33:58.590 --> 00:34:00.420 align:middle line:84%
he had done with
the mushroom Amanita

00:34:00.420 --> 00:34:02.320 align:middle line:90%
muscaria and some others.

00:34:02.320 --> 00:34:05.640 align:middle line:84%
But he realized that to
be in a receptive state,

00:34:05.640 --> 00:34:06.910 align:middle line:90%
it's very relaxed.

00:34:06.910 --> 00:34:09.270 align:middle line:84%
He called it the
cholinergic state.

00:34:09.270 --> 00:34:14.076 align:middle line:84%
But senders are in the
adrenergic stage related to a--

00:34:14.076 --> 00:34:14.909 align:middle line:90%
[INTERPOSING VOICES]

00:34:14.909 --> 00:34:15.224 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Jacked up.

00:34:15.224 --> 00:34:15.269 align:middle line:90%
Excited.

00:34:15.269 --> 00:34:16.590 align:middle line:90%
>>MCNAMARA: Very jacked up.

00:34:16.590 --> 00:34:21.480 align:middle line:84%
So I think about a mom, she's
staring out the window at home,

00:34:21.480 --> 00:34:24.989 align:middle line:84%
she's very relaxed, and her son
is away at college in New York

00:34:24.989 --> 00:34:27.130 align:middle line:90%
and she's in California.

00:34:27.130 --> 00:34:28.199 align:middle line:90%
She's very relaxed.

00:34:28.199 --> 00:34:29.909 align:middle line:84%
And suddenly she
gets this impression

00:34:29.909 --> 00:34:33.730 align:middle line:84%
that her son has been
in a car accident.

00:34:33.730 --> 00:34:36.790 align:middle line:84%
And five minutes later, she gets
a phone call from the hospital

00:34:36.790 --> 00:34:39.855 align:middle line:84%
and her son indeed was
just in a car accident.

00:34:39.855 --> 00:34:41.230 align:middle line:84%
And what we have
here is that she

00:34:41.230 --> 00:34:45.280 align:middle line:84%
was very relaxed and
receptive and her son, who

00:34:45.280 --> 00:34:49.719 align:middle line:84%
she has a link with by birth,
he's in the opposite state.

00:34:49.719 --> 00:34:52.010 align:middle line:84%
He's jacked up
because of the stress,

00:34:52.010 --> 00:34:53.095 align:middle line:90%
the tension, the crisis--

00:34:53.095 --> 00:34:54.679 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: He's sending
the signal out.

00:34:54.679 --> 00:34:56.429 align:middle line:84%
>>MCNAMARA: --he's
sending the signal out.

00:34:56.429 --> 00:34:59.500 align:middle line:84%
And I thought I would test this
idea about two different states

00:34:59.500 --> 00:35:04.250 align:middle line:84%
with my friends where the remote
viewers would be very relaxed.

00:35:04.250 --> 00:35:06.940 align:middle line:84%
I would use some hypnotic
induction or just guided

00:35:06.940 --> 00:35:10.370 align:middle line:84%
meditation to put them
in a relaxed state,

00:35:10.370 --> 00:35:14.180 align:middle line:84%
but then they were receiving
the information from themselves

00:35:14.180 --> 00:35:15.660 align:middle line:90%
in the future.

00:35:15.660 --> 00:35:18.020 align:middle line:84%
So in the future, they
are their own sender

00:35:18.020 --> 00:35:20.240 align:middle line:90%
sending the information.

00:35:20.240 --> 00:35:22.960 align:middle line:84%
Then I wanted them to be
in that jacked-up state,

00:35:22.960 --> 00:35:26.197 align:middle line:84%
so I asked them to dunk their
arms in buckets of ice water.

00:35:26.197 --> 00:35:28.780 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So you're asking them
to be both relaxed and excited

00:35:28.780 --> 00:35:29.580 align:middle line:90%
at the same time?

00:35:29.580 --> 00:35:31.372 align:middle line:84%
>>MCNAMARA: At the
president in the future.

00:35:31.372 --> 00:35:32.260 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:35:32.260 --> 00:35:34.990 align:middle line:84%
So the signal is not going
from one place to another

00:35:34.990 --> 00:35:37.100 align:middle line:90%
but from one time to another.

00:35:37.100 --> 00:35:40.000 align:middle line:84%
But in the future, they're
playing the role of the college

00:35:40.000 --> 00:35:41.260 align:middle line:90%
student in the car accident--

00:35:41.260 --> 00:35:41.650 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: And ascending.

00:35:41.650 --> 00:35:43.983 align:middle line:84%
>>MCNAMARA: --and descending
because their arm is dunked

00:35:43.983 --> 00:35:46.135 align:middle line:84%
in this painfully cold
ice water which is--

00:35:46.135 --> 00:35:48.240 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: While they're relaxed
and receptive as the receiver.

00:35:48.240 --> 00:35:48.860 align:middle line:90%
>>MCNAMARA: Yes.

00:35:48.860 --> 00:35:50.110 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Well, that's tricky.

00:35:50.110 --> 00:35:51.210 align:middle line:90%
>>MCNAMARA: That's tricky.

00:35:51.210 --> 00:35:54.760 align:middle line:84%
It's how am I going to be my own
telephone system across time?

00:35:54.760 --> 00:35:57.130 align:middle line:84%
Well, to receive
I'll be relaxed,

00:35:57.130 --> 00:35:59.550 align:middle line:84%
to send back in
time to myself I'll

00:35:59.550 --> 00:36:02.170 align:middle line:84%
have to be very
excited, very amped up.

00:36:02.170 --> 00:36:05.470 align:middle line:84%
And the ice water thing
is a common practice

00:36:05.470 --> 00:36:08.110 align:middle line:84%
in psychology experiments
about how much

00:36:08.110 --> 00:36:11.210 align:middle line:84%
pain will people endure with
different kinds of motivation.

00:36:11.210 --> 00:36:14.230 align:middle line:84%
So there was no permanent
damage and it's a lot of fun.

00:36:14.230 --> 00:36:20.270 align:middle line:10%
>>REGINA: And this also gets to
the notion that a lot of times

00:36:20.270 --> 00:36:22.110 align:middle line:10%
like in a group of
friends, for example,

00:36:22.110 --> 00:36:24.380 align:middle line:10%
where you have close
friends, if someone's

00:36:24.380 --> 00:36:28.620 align:middle line:10%
in distress, their friends just
out of the blue start calling.

00:36:28.620 --> 00:36:30.780 align:middle line:84%
And I think almost everybody
has been through this.

00:36:30.780 --> 00:36:32.630 align:middle line:84%
So this is just an
everyday example

00:36:32.630 --> 00:36:35.120 align:middle line:84%
of how this is always
working, right?

00:36:35.120 --> 00:36:36.470 align:middle line:90%
>>MCNAMARA: Absolutely.

00:36:36.470 --> 00:36:40.850 align:middle line:84%
Any time a person if a
friend is coming to mind,

00:36:40.850 --> 00:36:42.350 align:middle line:84%
usually, they don't
think about them

00:36:42.350 --> 00:36:44.392 align:middle line:84%
for weeks at a time and
somebody think about them

00:36:44.392 --> 00:36:48.090 align:middle line:84%
two or three times in the
last few days, column.

00:36:48.090 --> 00:36:49.950 align:middle line:90%
It can't hurt at the very least.

00:36:49.950 --> 00:36:50.870 align:middle line:90%
Get over the ego.

00:36:50.870 --> 00:36:53.060 align:middle line:84%
You're not going to take
up anyone's time call

00:36:53.060 --> 00:36:56.730 align:middle line:84%
because that's what's being
asked on this deeper level.

00:36:56.730 --> 00:36:59.052 align:middle line:10%
So follow through
and something amazing

00:36:59.052 --> 00:37:00.260 align:middle line:10%
could happen because of that.

00:37:00.260 --> 00:37:02.270 align:middle line:10%
Not only might you actually
be perceiving a need

00:37:02.270 --> 00:37:03.800 align:middle line:10%
but you'll be fulfilling a need.

00:37:03.800 --> 00:37:05.913 align:middle line:84%
You'll be confirming
a connection

00:37:05.913 --> 00:37:06.830 align:middle line:90%
you have with someone.

00:37:06.830 --> 00:37:08.538 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And you'll
be honoring yourself

00:37:08.538 --> 00:37:11.060 align:middle line:84%
for signaling you to
begin with in developing

00:37:11.060 --> 00:37:12.200 align:middle line:90%
confidence in yourself.

00:37:12.200 --> 00:37:14.450 align:middle line:84%
>>MCNAMARA: And that's perhaps
the most important part

00:37:14.450 --> 00:37:18.867 align:middle line:84%
of developing one's intuition
is developing confidence through

00:37:18.867 --> 00:37:19.825 align:middle line:90%
repeated confirmation--

00:37:19.825 --> 00:37:21.005 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes, absolutely.

00:37:21.005 --> 00:37:22.422 align:middle line:84%
>>MCNAMARA: --over
and over again.

00:37:22.422 --> 00:37:26.210 align:middle line:84%
And the more you trust
yourself the more receptive

00:37:26.210 --> 00:37:28.850 align:middle line:90%
you become over time.

00:37:28.850 --> 00:37:33.680 align:middle line:84%
The ice bucket experiment
led me to believe this idea

00:37:33.680 --> 00:37:35.510 align:middle line:84%
about why some people
are really lucky

00:37:35.510 --> 00:37:38.360 align:middle line:84%
and why some people
are always unlucky.

00:37:38.360 --> 00:37:40.730 align:middle line:84%
I think we do this thing
about talking to ourselves

00:37:40.730 --> 00:37:43.230 align:middle line:90%
across time all the time.

00:37:43.230 --> 00:37:45.530 align:middle line:84%
Imagine you're trying
to make a decision,

00:37:45.530 --> 00:37:49.070 align:middle line:84%
should I agree to do
this or not agree?

00:37:49.070 --> 00:37:51.260 align:middle line:84%
And you go forward
in the future and you

00:37:51.260 --> 00:37:53.895 align:middle line:90%
made the right decision.

00:37:53.895 --> 00:37:55.520 align:middle line:84%
These are the lucky
people because what

00:37:55.520 --> 00:37:56.960 align:middle line:90%
they do is they celebrate.

00:37:56.960 --> 00:38:00.860 align:middle line:84%
So instead of causing themselves
pain, instead they celebrate.

00:38:00.860 --> 00:38:02.930 align:middle line:84%
They're really good
at acknowledging, yes,

00:38:02.930 --> 00:38:04.270 align:middle line:90%
this was the right decision.

00:38:04.270 --> 00:38:05.320 align:middle line:90%
I'm so happy.

00:38:05.320 --> 00:38:06.320 align:middle line:90%
And that is the energy--

00:38:06.320 --> 00:38:07.460 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Reinforces everything.

00:38:07.460 --> 00:38:09.127 align:middle line:84%
>>MCNAMARA: --that
sends the information

00:38:09.127 --> 00:38:11.840 align:middle line:84%
back to when they needed
to choose left or right

00:38:11.840 --> 00:38:17.290 align:middle line:84%
versus the unlucky person,
who they doubt themselves,

00:38:17.290 --> 00:38:21.970 align:middle line:84%
or even when good things
happen they underplay it,

00:38:21.970 --> 00:38:23.200 align:middle line:90%
they bury it.

00:38:23.200 --> 00:38:25.780 align:middle line:84%
Maybe they don't feel
deserving or maybe they're

00:38:25.780 --> 00:38:27.940 align:middle line:84%
still not sure if this
is the right thing.

00:38:27.940 --> 00:38:31.030 align:middle line:84%
And then either no
signal is being sent back

00:38:31.030 --> 00:38:34.870 align:middle line:84%
or a convoluted signal
is being sent back,

00:38:34.870 --> 00:38:36.700 align:middle line:84%
and so they're not
really communicating

00:38:36.700 --> 00:38:38.200 align:middle line:84%
with themselves
across time the way

00:38:38.200 --> 00:38:42.160 align:middle line:84%
the person who is affirming
their decision, celebrating it.

00:38:42.160 --> 00:38:44.380 align:middle line:84%
Their mind is imbued
with love, which

00:38:44.380 --> 00:38:48.100 align:middle line:84%
I think is the best
transmitter of information.

00:38:48.100 --> 00:38:51.080 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And you
have to commit.

00:38:51.080 --> 00:38:54.170 align:middle line:10%
And oftentimes I think
what you're mentioning here

00:38:54.170 --> 00:38:58.640 align:middle line:10%
is people that second guess
themselves a lot don't commit.

00:38:58.640 --> 00:39:00.440 align:middle line:10%
You stay in no
man's land, and it

00:39:00.440 --> 00:39:04.010 align:middle line:10%
seems that someone with
the most amazing potential

00:39:04.010 --> 00:39:06.050 align:middle line:10%
just doesn't manifest.

00:39:06.050 --> 00:39:09.200 align:middle line:10%
Their reality doesn't manifest
into what everybody else can

00:39:09.200 --> 00:39:13.040 align:middle line:10%
see, these incredible
potentials and capabilities

00:39:13.040 --> 00:39:16.250 align:middle line:10%
because they're constantly
second-guessing themselves

00:39:16.250 --> 00:39:20.030 align:middle line:10%
and doubting, and so
they become paralyzed.

00:39:20.030 --> 00:39:23.210 align:middle line:84%
>>MCNAMARA: And it's sad because
there are so many resources

00:39:23.210 --> 00:39:25.910 align:middle line:84%
to teach people how to
access their intuition

00:39:25.910 --> 00:39:28.200 align:middle line:84%
but there is that
psychological aspect.

00:39:28.200 --> 00:39:31.160 align:middle line:84%
You beat yourself up,
you don't trust yourself,

00:39:31.160 --> 00:39:32.060 align:middle line:90%
second-guessing.

00:39:32.060 --> 00:39:34.890 align:middle line:84%
I experienced that all
the time for myself.

00:39:34.890 --> 00:39:38.742 align:middle line:84%
That is something
I still work on

00:39:38.742 --> 00:39:39.950 align:middle line:90%
and I'm getting better at it.

00:39:39.950 --> 00:39:42.950 align:middle line:84%
I can tell when I'm sabotaging
myself a little more

00:39:42.950 --> 00:39:45.170 align:middle line:84%
and then I'll choose the
other option instead.

00:39:45.170 --> 00:39:46.380 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Good for you.

00:39:46.380 --> 00:39:47.180 align:middle line:90%
The other door.

00:39:47.180 --> 00:39:48.310 align:middle line:90%
Choose the opposite door.

00:39:48.310 --> 00:39:48.800 align:middle line:84%
>>MCNAMARA: Choose
the other door

00:39:48.800 --> 00:39:51.500 align:middle line:84%
because there I am again
doing that thing I do,

00:39:51.500 --> 00:39:52.370 align:middle line:90%
doubting myself.

00:39:52.370 --> 00:39:55.100 align:middle line:84%
And I've seen this in my
own psychic experiments

00:39:55.100 --> 00:39:58.250 align:middle line:84%
at home where I track my
progress on my records.

00:39:58.250 --> 00:40:04.200 align:middle line:84%
There's something a phenomenon
called psi missing, P-S-I, psi

00:40:04.200 --> 00:40:05.000 align:middle line:90%
missing.

00:40:05.000 --> 00:40:07.370 align:middle line:84%
Where instead of showing
your psychic ability

00:40:07.370 --> 00:40:11.760 align:middle line:84%
by doing considerably
well over chance,

00:40:11.760 --> 00:40:13.880 align:middle line:84%
so if it's something
about choosing

00:40:13.880 --> 00:40:16.880 align:middle line:84%
different targets above
average, you're showing

00:40:16.880 --> 00:40:18.152 align:middle line:90%
you're a psychic.

00:40:18.152 --> 00:40:19.610 align:middle line:84%
If you weren't
psychic at all you'd

00:40:19.610 --> 00:40:25.340 align:middle line:84%
be around average or a chance
level or would be like random.

00:40:25.340 --> 00:40:30.880 align:middle line:10%
But often I'm so
below chance that it

00:40:30.880 --> 00:40:33.880 align:middle line:10%
shows I am being psychic but
I am contradicting myself,

00:40:33.880 --> 00:40:35.470 align:middle line:10%
so I'm doing so poorly.

00:40:35.470 --> 00:40:36.910 align:middle line:84%
I'm doing more
poorly than I could

00:40:36.910 --> 00:40:39.337 align:middle line:90%
do if I was just being random.

00:40:39.337 --> 00:40:40.420 align:middle line:90%
So psychic man is working.

00:40:40.420 --> 00:40:42.087 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: You're
having a psychic effect

00:40:42.087 --> 00:40:43.180 align:middle line:90%
but on a downward level.

00:40:43.180 --> 00:40:43.450 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHTER]

00:40:43.450 --> 00:40:45.283 align:middle line:84%
>>MCNAMARA: Because I'm
doubting everything.

00:40:45.283 --> 00:40:47.680 align:middle line:84%
I'm seeing correctly and I'm
going the opposite direction

00:40:47.680 --> 00:40:50.485 align:middle line:84%
because I'm doubting
myself every moment.

00:40:50.485 --> 00:40:53.710 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: That's so interesting
that you who teach this

00:40:53.710 --> 00:40:55.090 align:middle line:90%
go through this yourself.

00:40:55.090 --> 00:40:57.400 align:middle line:84%
So that makes you much
more approachable and real

00:40:57.400 --> 00:41:00.465 align:middle line:84%
because that's where
a lot of people are.

00:41:00.465 --> 00:41:02.470 align:middle line:84%
>>MCNAMARA: I'm not a
super psychic or anything.

00:41:02.470 --> 00:41:04.780 align:middle line:84%
I think my talent is
helping people bring it out

00:41:04.780 --> 00:41:05.220 align:middle line:90%
of themselves.

00:41:05.220 --> 00:41:05.805 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:41:05.805 --> 00:41:06.070 align:middle line:90%
Good teacher.

00:41:06.070 --> 00:41:07.660 align:middle line:90%
>>MCNAMARA: I enjoy teaching it.

00:41:07.660 --> 00:41:10.658 align:middle line:84%
I'm not particularly
psychic above average, maybe

00:41:10.658 --> 00:41:12.200 align:middle line:84%
just because I've
been exposed to it.

00:41:12.200 --> 00:41:14.740 align:middle line:84%
But I have to work
really hard if I want

00:41:14.740 --> 00:41:17.200 align:middle line:90%
to develop my scores basically.

00:41:17.200 --> 00:41:20.170 align:middle line:84%
When I'm training
things get better.

00:41:20.170 --> 00:41:22.587 align:middle line:84%
When I'm in crisis, when I'm
depressed, when I'm worn out,

00:41:22.587 --> 00:41:23.670 align:middle line:90%
then I'll go through that.

00:41:23.670 --> 00:41:25.670 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Well, and
that's true for everybody.

00:41:25.670 --> 00:41:27.462 align:middle line:84%
And that's why I brought
that up earlier is

00:41:27.462 --> 00:41:30.140 align:middle line:84%
that we can't afford to work
against ourselves anymore.

00:41:30.140 --> 00:41:33.700 align:middle line:84%
We have to find a way to find
some optimism, some faith

00:41:33.700 --> 00:41:36.460 align:middle line:84%
in something, some
joy again so that we

00:41:36.460 --> 00:41:38.530 align:middle line:90%
can get these facilities open.

00:41:38.530 --> 00:41:39.910 align:middle line:90%
That is our inheritance.

00:41:39.910 --> 00:41:44.810 align:middle line:84%
Our future is to be able to
see beyond time and space.

00:41:44.810 --> 00:41:47.710 align:middle line:84%
And we don't need
to keep allowing

00:41:47.710 --> 00:41:50.920 align:middle line:84%
ourselves to be stepped on and
have that stomped out of us.

00:41:50.920 --> 00:41:53.320 align:middle line:84%
I get really angry
over that personally.

00:41:53.320 --> 00:41:55.010 align:middle line:90%
So we have a few minutes left.

00:41:55.010 --> 00:41:56.860 align:middle line:84%
Let's talk about one
area you're going into.

00:41:56.860 --> 00:41:58.277 align:middle line:84%
You're exploring
a little bit more

00:41:58.277 --> 00:42:00.290 align:middle line:90%
and maybe writing on as well.

00:42:00.290 --> 00:42:06.490 align:middle line:84%
And it has to do with people who
are getting messages from ETs,

00:42:06.490 --> 00:42:09.230 align:middle line:84%
of planet cultures of
one kind or another,

00:42:09.230 --> 00:42:12.160 align:middle line:84%
and what is it about
that in remote viewing

00:42:12.160 --> 00:42:14.770 align:middle line:84%
that you're really
struck by at the moment?

00:42:14.770 --> 00:42:16.720 align:middle line:10%
>>MCNAMARA: Well, I
know plenty of people

00:42:16.720 --> 00:42:21.190 align:middle line:10%
have seen craft in the sky or
had interactions spontaneously.

00:42:21.190 --> 00:42:22.600 align:middle line:90%
They didn't have to work for it.

00:42:22.600 --> 00:42:25.720 align:middle line:84%
And from my experience,
training and psychic abilities

00:42:25.720 --> 00:42:28.533 align:middle line:84%
opens a person up
or has opened me up,

00:42:28.533 --> 00:42:29.950 align:middle line:84%
where I started
having experiences

00:42:29.950 --> 00:42:31.205 align:middle line:90%
with non-human entities.

00:42:31.205 --> 00:42:32.830 align:middle line:84%
And I think they
wouldn't have happened

00:42:32.830 --> 00:42:36.565 align:middle line:84%
if I hadn't been opening my mind
by training in remote viewing

00:42:36.565 --> 00:42:37.690 align:middle line:90%
or out-of-body experiences.

00:42:37.690 --> 00:42:39.773 align:middle line:10%
>>REGINA: So tell us a
little bit about the nature

00:42:39.773 --> 00:42:41.770 align:middle line:10%
of these communications?

00:42:41.770 --> 00:42:45.100 align:middle line:84%
>>MCNAMARA: Well,
so in the beginning,

00:42:45.100 --> 00:42:48.220 align:middle line:84%
they were in let's
say the liminal state,

00:42:48.220 --> 00:42:50.470 align:middle line:84%
which is where the
out-of-body experience occurs.

00:42:50.470 --> 00:42:53.140 align:middle line:84%
Because you're conscious
but your body is asleep.

00:42:53.140 --> 00:42:56.380 align:middle line:90%
And the first one for me--

00:42:56.380 --> 00:42:59.770 align:middle line:84%
first or second one,
is I'm in bed asleep,

00:42:59.770 --> 00:43:01.270 align:middle line:84%
and then I become
conscious and it's

00:43:01.270 --> 00:43:03.110 align:middle line:84%
as if the room is
filled with moonlight.

00:43:03.110 --> 00:43:07.270 align:middle line:84%
My eyes were closed but there
was this light shining in.

00:43:07.270 --> 00:43:10.000 align:middle line:84%
And so I opened my eyes
and the room is pitch dark.

00:43:10.000 --> 00:43:11.000 align:middle line:90%
There's no moon.

00:43:11.000 --> 00:43:11.800 align:middle line:90%
There's nothing.

00:43:11.800 --> 00:43:13.900 align:middle line:84%
I close them again,
drift off to sleep,

00:43:13.900 --> 00:43:16.990 align:middle line:84%
but I become conscious
again and there's a light.

00:43:16.990 --> 00:43:19.370 align:middle line:84%
And I do this two
or three times.

00:43:19.370 --> 00:43:22.210 align:middle line:84%
And then the next time
I drift back and relax

00:43:22.210 --> 00:43:25.210 align:middle line:84%
the light comes on and then
there's a face looking right

00:43:25.210 --> 00:43:27.730 align:middle line:90%
at me in the liminal state.

00:43:27.730 --> 00:43:31.363 align:middle line:84%
So if my wife woke up in
the bedroom and saw me

00:43:31.363 --> 00:43:33.280 align:middle line:84%
I don't know if she would
see a face floating.

00:43:33.280 --> 00:43:36.340 align:middle line:84%
So this is in
consciousness, just

00:43:36.340 --> 00:43:39.310 align:middle line:84%
letting me know
that it was there.

00:43:39.310 --> 00:43:40.750 align:middle line:90%
So that was a little disturbing.

00:43:40.750 --> 00:43:43.817 align:middle line:84%
I was bothered for a few weeks
by it because I had no control

00:43:43.817 --> 00:43:45.400 align:middle line:84%
and it was clear
that I had no control

00:43:45.400 --> 00:43:48.273 align:middle line:84%
but it was letting me know
that it was looking at me.

00:43:48.273 --> 00:43:49.690 align:middle line:84%
There were a few
times where there

00:43:49.690 --> 00:43:53.970 align:middle line:84%
would be something at the door,
again, at the liminal state.

00:43:53.970 --> 00:43:57.720 align:middle line:84%
And then the most
profound one that happened

00:43:57.720 --> 00:43:58.950 align:middle line:90%
was an intimate moment.

00:43:58.950 --> 00:44:02.590 align:middle line:84%
I became conscious in the
liminal state having a--

00:44:02.590 --> 00:44:06.205 align:middle line:84%
was in union with
a feminine being.

00:44:06.205 --> 00:44:09.070 align:middle line:90%


00:44:09.070 --> 00:44:11.320 align:middle line:84%
And it was sort of a
Kundalini experience

00:44:11.320 --> 00:44:13.115 align:middle line:84%
where this energy
rose in my body.

00:44:13.115 --> 00:44:14.740 align:middle line:84%
And I don't know what
the purpose of it

00:44:14.740 --> 00:44:16.600 align:middle line:90%
was but it stuck with me.

00:44:16.600 --> 00:44:18.850 align:middle line:84%
And I think it has
had an influence

00:44:18.850 --> 00:44:21.430 align:middle line:84%
on what I've focused on since
then because it actually

00:44:21.430 --> 00:44:24.818 align:middle line:84%
drove me to seek more
evidence in the physical world

00:44:24.818 --> 00:44:26.860 align:middle line:84%
because how much can I
trust this stuff happening

00:44:26.860 --> 00:44:28.272 align:middle line:90%
in the middle of the night?

00:44:28.272 --> 00:44:29.230 align:middle line:90%
I wanted more evidence.

00:44:29.230 --> 00:44:33.160 align:middle line:84%
So I spent a weekend with Paula
Harris and Ricardo Gonzalez

00:44:33.160 --> 00:44:35.152 align:middle line:90%
in Crestone, Colorado.

00:44:35.152 --> 00:44:36.670 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: A lot going on there.

00:44:36.670 --> 00:44:38.045 align:middle line:84%
>>MCNAMARA: A lot
going on there.

00:44:38.045 --> 00:44:40.680 align:middle line:84%
And the thought was
that Ricardo is someone

00:44:40.680 --> 00:44:45.870 align:middle line:84%
who has repeated since decades
of being in contact with them

00:44:45.870 --> 00:44:48.270 align:middle line:84%
and them showing up
surrounded by witnesses.

00:44:48.270 --> 00:44:51.480 align:middle line:84%
So I went and we had
sightings both nights.

00:44:51.480 --> 00:44:53.100 align:middle line:84%
And that gave me
the confirmation

00:44:53.100 --> 00:44:57.380 align:middle line:84%
that what I'd been experiencing
before then was valid.

00:44:57.380 --> 00:45:00.380 align:middle line:10%
And now I know I shouldn't
even have doubted myself

00:45:00.380 --> 00:45:02.870 align:middle line:10%
because if something
affects you,

00:45:02.870 --> 00:45:06.920 align:middle line:10%
whether it's a dream or some
other mystical experience

00:45:06.920 --> 00:45:08.420 align:middle line:10%
or you're wide
awake, whatever it

00:45:08.420 --> 00:45:10.580 align:middle line:10%
is if it affects you and
changes your personality

00:45:10.580 --> 00:45:13.200 align:middle line:10%
or has an emotional
impact, it's real.

00:45:13.200 --> 00:45:14.545 align:middle line:90%
That's what real is.

00:45:14.545 --> 00:45:16.490 align:middle line:84%
Not just because
there's a witness,

00:45:16.490 --> 00:45:19.720 align:middle line:84%
there was a photograph--
no, how did it affect you?

00:45:19.720 --> 00:45:21.740 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And so now
as you're working

00:45:21.740 --> 00:45:23.840 align:middle line:84%
with people and
you have students

00:45:23.840 --> 00:45:26.545 align:middle line:84%
and such you're finding this
is not an uncommon phenomenon?

00:45:26.545 --> 00:45:27.350 align:middle line:90%
>>MCNAMARA: No.

00:45:27.350 --> 00:45:29.840 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And so it
has implications.

00:45:29.840 --> 00:45:33.050 align:middle line:10%
And we don't have time to
talk about the implications

00:45:33.050 --> 00:45:35.330 align:middle line:10%
because we're out
of time, but what

00:45:35.330 --> 00:45:38.450 align:middle line:10%
I'd like to do is
pick up this thread,

00:45:38.450 --> 00:45:42.260 align:middle line:10%
have you back in the future
and talk about specifically

00:45:42.260 --> 00:45:44.870 align:middle line:10%
this subject and the
implications of what

00:45:44.870 --> 00:45:47.300 align:middle line:10%
you and many, many
others are receiving

00:45:47.300 --> 00:45:51.830 align:middle line:10%
from these interdimensional
beings even physically

00:45:51.830 --> 00:45:53.690 align:middle line:10%
teased but often
interdimensional

00:45:53.690 --> 00:45:55.260 align:middle line:10%
that can manifest here.

00:45:55.260 --> 00:45:59.030 align:middle line:84%
And what we can do with
that information, what

00:45:59.030 --> 00:46:01.100 align:middle line:84%
the implications of it
are because there seems

00:46:01.100 --> 00:46:02.610 align:middle line:90%
to be a consistency to it?

00:46:02.610 --> 00:46:04.370 align:middle line:84%
So I'll just leave
that is a little tease.

00:46:04.370 --> 00:46:04.950 align:middle line:90%
How's that?

00:46:04.950 --> 00:46:05.480 align:middle line:90%
>>MCNAMARA: Sounds great

00:46:05.480 --> 00:46:07.370 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Sean, it's so
nice having you here.

00:46:07.370 --> 00:46:11.750 align:middle line:84%
I love the fact that you're
so grounded and so real,

00:46:11.750 --> 00:46:14.780 align:middle line:84%
and like you said,
your passion is

00:46:14.780 --> 00:46:17.580 align:middle line:84%
in helping people discover
this in themselves.

00:46:17.580 --> 00:46:20.330 align:middle line:10%
And I love the fact that you
brought the physical part

00:46:20.330 --> 00:46:23.060 align:middle line:10%
into it and the
need for us to start

00:46:23.060 --> 00:46:26.240 align:middle line:10%
taking care of our bodies,
self-care, massage,

00:46:26.240 --> 00:46:29.600 align:middle line:10%
and so forth to start opening
ourselves up after such

00:46:29.600 --> 00:46:34.470 align:middle line:10%
a dark time in human history.

00:46:34.470 --> 00:46:35.790 align:middle line:90%
So I appreciate that.

00:46:35.790 --> 00:46:36.590 align:middle line:90%
Thank you.

00:46:36.590 --> 00:46:37.050 align:middle line:90%
