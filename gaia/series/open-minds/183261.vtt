>> REGINA MEREDITH: Radleigh
Valentine has been through

00:00:22.120 --> 00:00:24.790 align:middle line:10%
quite a life journey to become
an author on the subject

00:00:24.790 --> 00:00:25.990 align:middle line:10%
of divination.

00:00:25.990 --> 00:00:28.690 align:middle line:10%
From tarot to runes
to pendulums and more,

00:00:28.690 --> 00:00:30.820 align:middle line:10%
he's created a reference
for all things that

00:00:30.820 --> 00:00:34.510 align:middle line:10%
are used for divining our deeper
truths in his book "Compendium

00:00:34.510 --> 00:00:35.890 align:middle line:10%
of Magical Things."

00:00:35.890 --> 00:00:37.170 align:middle line:90%
Welcome, Radleigh.

00:00:37.170 --> 00:00:37.580 align:middle line:90%
>> RADLEIGH VALENTINE: Hi.

00:00:37.580 --> 00:00:38.930 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: It's good to see you.

00:00:38.930 --> 00:00:40.120 align:middle line:84%
>> VALENTINE: It's
wonderful to see you.

00:00:40.120 --> 00:00:40.920 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Yeah.

00:00:40.920 --> 00:00:44.793 align:middle line:84%
The subject of trying to discern
truth in an age of delusion.

00:00:44.793 --> 00:00:46.960 align:middle line:84%
I mean, I don't think there's
any other word for it.

00:00:46.960 --> 00:00:47.250 align:middle line:90%
>> VALENTINE: No.

00:00:47.250 --> 00:00:47.440 align:middle line:90%
Truth.

00:00:47.440 --> 00:00:49.232 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: You can be
polite and say, well,

00:00:49.232 --> 00:00:52.130 align:middle line:84%
it's just preference
and so forth,

00:00:52.130 --> 00:00:54.940 align:middle line:84%
but I think it really like
slipped over the edge into flat

00:00:54.940 --> 00:00:56.170 align:middle line:90%
out delusion.

00:00:56.170 --> 00:00:57.700 align:middle line:84%
And the problem
is a lot of people

00:00:57.700 --> 00:01:01.150 align:middle line:84%
even when they're divining
delude themselves to, right?

00:01:01.150 --> 00:01:03.760 align:middle line:84%
You know, and we're going
to talk about the right way

00:01:03.760 --> 00:01:06.785 align:middle line:84%
to divine and all the different
means with which to do it.

00:01:06.785 --> 00:01:09.160 align:middle line:84%
But first we want to get to
know you a little bit better,

00:01:09.160 --> 00:01:11.350 align:middle line:84%
because you come from
a background, really

00:01:11.350 --> 00:01:12.750 align:middle line:90%
the southern Bible Belt.

00:01:12.750 --> 00:01:14.520 align:middle line:90%
>> VALENTINE: I do.

00:01:14.520 --> 00:01:16.270 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: And as you
admit in your book,

00:01:16.270 --> 00:01:18.310 align:middle line:90%
you had some fears to overcome.

00:01:18.310 --> 00:01:20.290 align:middle line:84%
So tell us a little bit
about your background

00:01:20.290 --> 00:01:21.730 align:middle line:90%
and your own personal journey.

00:01:21.730 --> 00:01:22.688 align:middle line:90%
>> VALENTINE: Oh, sure.

00:01:22.688 --> 00:01:24.940 align:middle line:10%
So I was raised in the South.

00:01:24.940 --> 00:01:26.998 align:middle line:10%
And if I talked the
way I was raised,

00:01:26.998 --> 00:01:28.290 align:middle line:10%
it would sound a lot like this.

00:01:28.290 --> 00:01:29.090 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Yes.

00:01:29.090 --> 00:01:30.960 align:middle line:84%
Only little teensy
hints left of it.

00:01:30.960 --> 00:01:32.020 align:middle line:84%
>> VALENTINE: Only
teensy hints left.

00:01:32.020 --> 00:01:32.820 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Yes.

00:01:32.820 --> 00:01:34.060 align:middle line:90%
>> VALENTINE: That's correct.

00:01:34.060 --> 00:01:36.820 align:middle line:90%
I was raised in Tennessee.

00:01:36.820 --> 00:01:40.010 align:middle line:90%
And it was a difficult time.

00:01:40.010 --> 00:01:42.370 align:middle line:84%
It was a difficult
time particularly

00:01:42.370 --> 00:01:45.400 align:middle line:84%
for a little kid who was
already showing signs

00:01:45.400 --> 00:01:49.090 align:middle line:90%
of having psychic abilities.

00:01:49.090 --> 00:01:54.550 align:middle line:84%
From the time I was five, I was
starting to show little things.

00:01:54.550 --> 00:01:58.510 align:middle line:84%
I also was born gay,
which was not fun

00:01:58.510 --> 00:02:00.760 align:middle line:90%
in the South in the '70s.

00:02:00.760 --> 00:02:06.740 align:middle line:84%
And I was not the kid, my
dad had in mind at all.

00:02:06.740 --> 00:02:09.669 align:middle line:84%
So that was not a
joyful relationship.

00:02:09.669 --> 00:02:11.810 align:middle line:90%
But I had an amazing mom.

00:02:11.810 --> 00:02:12.610 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Mom.

00:02:12.610 --> 00:02:13.090 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:02:13.090 --> 00:02:15.400 align:middle line:84%
>> VALENTINE: I had an
amazing mom, and grandmother,

00:02:15.400 --> 00:02:16.780 align:middle line:90%
and aunts.

00:02:16.780 --> 00:02:20.410 align:middle line:84%
So I was raised by these
incredibly amazing, powerful

00:02:20.410 --> 00:02:22.090 align:middle line:90%
women.

00:02:22.090 --> 00:02:24.140 align:middle line:90%
And so that was a blessing.

00:02:24.140 --> 00:02:27.820 align:middle line:84%
And you know what, Regina, it
was all a blessing, all of it.

00:02:27.820 --> 00:02:30.460 align:middle line:84%
Every last thing
that happened when

00:02:30.460 --> 00:02:33.940 align:middle line:84%
I was a kid that was a
challenge, that was a struggle,

00:02:33.940 --> 00:02:35.297 align:middle line:90%
it all made me the person--

00:02:35.297 --> 00:02:36.130 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Tell us--

00:02:36.130 --> 00:02:36.450 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:02:36.450 --> 00:02:37.060 align:middle line:90%
>> VALENTINE: --who I was.

00:02:37.060 --> 00:02:39.602 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: Tell us a blessing
in that kind of challenge where

00:02:39.602 --> 00:02:42.470 align:middle line:84%
you're being pretty severely
judged by your father.

00:02:42.470 --> 00:02:43.270 align:middle line:90%
>> VALENTINE: Yes.

00:02:43.270 --> 00:02:44.945 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Perhaps rejected.

00:02:44.945 --> 00:02:45.820 align:middle line:90%
>> VALENTINE: Abused.

00:02:45.820 --> 00:02:46.720 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: And abused.

00:02:46.720 --> 00:02:47.520 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:02:47.520 --> 00:02:49.570 align:middle line:84%
And tell us-- before
we even get going,

00:02:49.570 --> 00:02:52.570 align:middle line:84%
let's talk about the blessing
in that, where it lies

00:02:52.570 --> 00:02:57.040 align:middle line:84%
and what it did to you in terms
of your own building yourself.

00:02:57.040 --> 00:03:01.060 align:middle line:84%
>> VALENTINE: In that
harsh environment,

00:03:01.060 --> 00:03:05.920 align:middle line:84%
it just sort of forces you to
come to a reconciliation with

00:03:05.920 --> 00:03:07.960 align:middle line:90%
yourself about who you are.

00:03:07.960 --> 00:03:14.050 align:middle line:84%
And it also really built in
me this strength to not let

00:03:14.050 --> 00:03:18.490 align:middle line:84%
what other people think
of me be what defines me.

00:03:18.490 --> 00:03:21.580 align:middle line:84%
But that was a
process, because going

00:03:21.580 --> 00:03:24.790 align:middle line:84%
through elementary school, and
middle school, and high school,

00:03:24.790 --> 00:03:26.830 align:middle line:90%
it's like I had no friends.

00:03:26.830 --> 00:03:27.640 align:middle line:90%
Zero.

00:03:27.640 --> 00:03:30.940 align:middle line:84%
I remember being in my backyard
and just praying to God

00:03:30.940 --> 00:03:34.350 align:middle line:84%
can't I please, please,
please just have one friend.

00:03:34.350 --> 00:03:37.894 align:middle line:90%
And my dad was--

00:03:37.894 --> 00:03:42.610 align:middle line:84%
I've forgiven him everything,
but he was very abusive

00:03:42.610 --> 00:03:44.600 align:middle line:90%
physically and emotionally.

00:03:44.600 --> 00:03:45.400 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Yeah.

00:03:45.400 --> 00:03:48.520 align:middle line:84%
>> VALENTINE: You know,
when I got to this point,

00:03:48.520 --> 00:03:51.640 align:middle line:84%
a pivotal point for me was when
I got to my early 20s and it

00:03:51.640 --> 00:03:54.200 align:middle line:84%
was time to deal
with daddy issues.

00:03:54.200 --> 00:03:57.050 align:middle line:84%
And as a person who's
part Native American,

00:03:57.050 --> 00:04:00.130 align:middle line:84%
I sought out a Native
American counselor

00:04:00.130 --> 00:04:02.320 align:middle line:84%
to help me work through
the daddy stuff.

00:04:02.320 --> 00:04:04.480 align:middle line:84%
And she looked at me one
day and said, you know,

00:04:04.480 --> 00:04:10.390 align:middle line:84%
your dad must have loved
you an incredible amount

00:04:10.390 --> 00:04:15.820 align:middle line:84%
in order to come to Earth and
inhabit that part in your life

00:04:15.820 --> 00:04:20.500 align:middle line:84%
and be such a bad person
so that you could turn out

00:04:20.500 --> 00:04:23.420 align:middle line:90%
to be such a wonderful person.

00:04:23.420 --> 00:04:25.250 align:middle line:84%
And to me, that was
instant healing.

00:04:25.250 --> 00:04:26.050 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Right.

00:04:26.050 --> 00:04:29.020 align:middle line:84%
>> VALENTINE: But it also
sort of set the stage for me,

00:04:29.020 --> 00:04:31.580 align:middle line:84%
because I had this mother who
was like you will not judge

00:04:31.580 --> 00:04:32.380 align:middle line:90%
others.

00:04:32.380 --> 00:04:35.080 align:middle line:84%
You will not-- I
will not have it--

00:04:35.080 --> 00:04:38.050 align:middle line:84%
while I was being
so severely judged.

00:04:38.050 --> 00:04:44.720 align:middle line:84%
And so what I sort of came to
know is that, in that learning,

00:04:44.720 --> 00:04:49.300 align:middle line:84%
I learned that the more I am
myself, the more that I am just

00:04:49.300 --> 00:04:54.280 align:middle line:84%
brazenly out there as
a metaphysical person,

00:04:54.280 --> 00:04:57.130 align:middle line:84%
a spiritual person, someone who
talks to angels, someone who

00:04:57.130 --> 00:04:59.860 align:middle line:84%
plays with tarot,
someone who is also

00:04:59.860 --> 00:05:04.690 align:middle line:84%
gay and married to a
beautiful husband, and wears

00:05:04.690 --> 00:05:08.650 align:middle line:84%
sequins most of the time on
state and things like that,

00:05:08.650 --> 00:05:13.150 align:middle line:84%
the more I became myself
the more the world opened up

00:05:13.150 --> 00:05:14.023 align:middle line:90%
for me.

00:05:14.023 --> 00:05:15.190 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: That makes sense.

00:05:15.190 --> 00:05:16.648 align:middle line:84%
And you know,
Radleigh, most people

00:05:16.648 --> 00:05:18.280 align:middle line:90%
don't have that rough a path.

00:05:18.280 --> 00:05:20.540 align:middle line:84%
And most people don't
stand out as much

00:05:20.540 --> 00:05:23.480 align:middle line:84%
in their own world, the
world they're born into.

00:05:23.480 --> 00:05:27.260 align:middle line:84%
And as a result of
this attempt to fit in

00:05:27.260 --> 00:05:29.810 align:middle line:84%
so that you can have
friends, et cetera,

00:05:29.810 --> 00:05:34.580 align:middle line:84%
we do tend to compromise away
significant parts of ourself.

00:05:34.580 --> 00:05:36.410 align:middle line:84%
And so I can see what
you're saying here.

00:05:36.410 --> 00:05:38.463 align:middle line:84%
This gift is what
do you have to lose.

00:05:38.463 --> 00:05:39.380 align:middle line:90%
>> VALENTINE: Nothing.

00:05:39.380 --> 00:05:41.180 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: I don't
have friends anyway.

00:05:41.180 --> 00:05:42.240 align:middle line:90%
I'm going to be who I am.

00:05:42.240 --> 00:05:44.690 align:middle line:84%
And I think of David
Ike and his journey

00:05:44.690 --> 00:05:47.690 align:middle line:84%
too where he came out after
this mystical experience

00:05:47.690 --> 00:05:48.900 align:middle line:90%
after being a broadcaster.

00:05:48.900 --> 00:05:49.700 align:middle line:90%
Right.

00:05:49.700 --> 00:05:52.010 align:middle line:84%
Went on to TV and the
famous show in England,

00:05:52.010 --> 00:05:53.480 align:middle line:90%
the "Terry Wogan" show.

00:05:53.480 --> 00:05:57.750 align:middle line:84%
And they cut it to say I am God,
which was essentially saying,

00:05:57.750 --> 00:05:58.760 align:middle line:90%
we're all gods.

00:05:58.760 --> 00:06:00.800 align:middle line:84%
And then from that
point forward, he

00:06:00.800 --> 00:06:02.840 align:middle line:84%
said he walked to the
sound of distant laughter,

00:06:02.840 --> 00:06:06.950 align:middle line:84%
so there was nothing more to
lose to start just going for it

00:06:06.950 --> 00:06:08.060 align:middle line:90%
and being authentic.

00:06:08.060 --> 00:06:09.560 align:middle line:84%
And it's very similar
to what you're

00:06:09.560 --> 00:06:11.900 align:middle line:84%
saying, walking to
the sound of laughter,

00:06:11.900 --> 00:06:13.640 align:middle line:90%
of ridicule, and so forth.

00:06:13.640 --> 00:06:16.100 align:middle line:84%
And actually, I do
see the gift in that.

00:06:16.100 --> 00:06:18.380 align:middle line:84%
If we all had to walk
to the sound of laughter

00:06:18.380 --> 00:06:21.800 align:middle line:84%
and reconcile who we are
and stand up for who we are,

00:06:21.800 --> 00:06:23.832 align:middle line:84%
I think it would be a
more interesting planet.

00:06:23.832 --> 00:06:25.040 align:middle line:90%
>> VALENTINE: I think so too.

00:06:25.040 --> 00:06:27.560 align:middle line:84%
And I love what you
said, because not just

00:06:27.560 --> 00:06:29.210 align:middle line:90%
walking through laughter.

00:06:29.210 --> 00:06:33.410 align:middle line:84%
But for me, laughter
became everything.

00:06:33.410 --> 00:06:35.540 align:middle line:90%
I teach through laughter.

00:06:35.540 --> 00:06:38.180 align:middle line:90%
Poignancy through laughter.

00:06:38.180 --> 00:06:41.030 align:middle line:84%
And so, you know,
it's like, OK, fine.

00:06:41.030 --> 00:06:42.320 align:middle line:90%
Laugh at me if you want.

00:06:42.320 --> 00:06:43.520 align:middle line:90%
I'm laughing too.

00:06:43.520 --> 00:06:44.340 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Yeah.

00:06:44.340 --> 00:06:45.740 align:middle line:90%
And it loosens everybody up.

00:06:45.740 --> 00:06:46.050 align:middle line:90%
>> VALENTINE: Yes.

00:06:46.050 --> 00:06:47.900 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: It breaks
down all the defenses.

00:06:47.900 --> 00:06:50.777 align:middle line:84%
But I'm very appreciative that
you shared that story with us,

00:06:50.777 --> 00:06:52.610 align:middle line:84%
because I think we each
need to embrace that

00:06:52.610 --> 00:06:55.490 align:middle line:84%
and think about this notion
of being more authentic.

00:06:55.490 --> 00:06:57.680 align:middle line:84%
You always say be authentic,
but nothing forces you

00:06:57.680 --> 00:06:59.120 align:middle line:90%
into authenticity.

00:06:59.120 --> 00:07:01.830 align:middle line:84%
And it's hard to
create when you still

00:07:01.830 --> 00:07:05.130 align:middle line:84%
want to have your friends and
your family to support you

00:07:05.130 --> 00:07:06.230 align:middle line:90%
and relating to you.

00:07:06.230 --> 00:07:06.740 align:middle line:90%
>> VALENTINE: Right.

00:07:06.740 --> 00:07:09.032 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: How many of us
would still relate if we were

00:07:09.032 --> 00:07:11.009 align:middle line:90%
our true selves?

00:07:11.009 --> 00:07:13.387 align:middle line:90%
>> VALENTINE: I don't know.

00:07:13.387 --> 00:07:14.470 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Just a thought.

00:07:14.470 --> 00:07:15.770 align:middle line:90%
I'm just tossing it out there.

00:07:15.770 --> 00:07:16.910 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:07:16.910 --> 00:07:18.710 align:middle line:84%
So let's talk about--
you brought it up.

00:07:18.710 --> 00:07:20.480 align:middle line:84%
From the age of five,
you began having

00:07:20.480 --> 00:07:22.300 align:middle line:90%
certain psychic experiences.

00:07:22.300 --> 00:07:24.650 align:middle line:84%
And let's talk
about what happened.

00:07:24.650 --> 00:07:25.530 align:middle line:90%
It was Joshua, right?

00:07:25.530 --> 00:07:26.330 align:middle line:90%
>> VALENTINE: Yeah.

00:07:26.330 --> 00:07:27.130 align:middle line:90%
Joshua is--

00:07:27.130 --> 00:07:27.930 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Yeah.

00:07:27.930 --> 00:07:30.740 align:middle line:84%
Let's go through what started
happening when you were little.

00:07:30.740 --> 00:07:31.540 align:middle line:90%
>> VALENTINE: Yeah.

00:07:31.540 --> 00:07:34.370 align:middle line:84%
So Joshua is my
primary guardian angel.

00:07:34.370 --> 00:07:38.660 align:middle line:84%
And the thing about angels
is that not all angels

00:07:38.660 --> 00:07:42.170 align:middle line:84%
are white and fluffy with big
wings and stuff like that.

00:07:42.170 --> 00:07:45.200 align:middle line:84%
Angels present themselves
to us in the way

00:07:45.200 --> 00:07:47.670 align:middle line:90%
in which we need them to.

00:07:47.670 --> 00:07:49.670 align:middle line:90%
And so I'm this little kid.

00:07:49.670 --> 00:07:53.390 align:middle line:84%
I have accidentally outed
myself at the age of five

00:07:53.390 --> 00:07:55.530 align:middle line:84%
by writing a love
note to Mark Hawkins.

00:07:55.530 --> 00:07:56.330 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: OK.

00:07:56.330 --> 00:07:57.650 align:middle line:90%
To another boy.

00:07:57.650 --> 00:07:58.880 align:middle line:90%
How did he received that?

00:07:58.880 --> 00:08:01.293 align:middle line:84%
>> VALENTINE: You know,
initially he was really super

00:08:01.293 --> 00:08:03.710 align:middle line:84%
cool about it, because he'd
basically just brought it back

00:08:03.710 --> 00:08:07.680 align:middle line:84%
to me and said you're supposed
to write these to girls.

00:08:07.680 --> 00:08:10.420 align:middle line:90%
And I was like, why?

00:08:10.420 --> 00:08:11.510 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: But I like you.

00:08:11.510 --> 00:08:13.010 align:middle line:84%
>> VALENTINE: But then
he told everybody.

00:08:13.010 --> 00:08:13.400 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Oh yeah.

00:08:13.400 --> 00:08:14.070 align:middle line:90%
There you go.

00:08:14.070 --> 00:08:15.890 align:middle line:84%
>> VALENTINE: And so
because kids are kids.

00:08:15.890 --> 00:08:19.070 align:middle line:84%
And that's just,
you know, no other--

00:08:19.070 --> 00:08:24.750 align:middle line:84%
and I wouldn't have wanted any
other result. But nevertheless.

00:08:24.750 --> 00:08:27.890 align:middle line:84%
So as a kid, I knew
that there were angels

00:08:27.890 --> 00:08:30.390 align:middle line:84%
because my mom talked
about it all the time.

00:08:30.390 --> 00:08:33.929 align:middle line:84%
And I just started to
notice that Josh was around.

00:08:33.929 --> 00:08:36.110 align:middle line:84%
And so Josh presented
himself in the way

00:08:36.110 --> 00:08:38.500 align:middle line:90%
I needed him to present himself.

00:08:38.500 --> 00:08:40.259 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: Black
leather jacket or--

00:08:40.259 --> 00:08:41.059 align:middle line:90%
>> VALENTINE: No.

00:08:41.059 --> 00:08:43.525 align:middle line:90%
Like a 19-year-old brother.

00:08:43.525 --> 00:08:44.325 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: OK.

00:08:44.325 --> 00:08:45.125 align:middle line:90%
Coo.

00:08:45.125 --> 00:08:49.520 align:middle line:84%
>> VALENTINE: To my 5, 6, 7,
8, 9, 10-year-old younger self,

00:08:49.520 --> 00:08:51.920 align:middle line:84%
the kid that was-- the
older brother who was going

00:08:51.920 --> 00:08:59.110 align:middle line:84%
to protect me, noogie me, and,
to an extent, make fun of me,

00:08:59.110 --> 00:09:01.130 align:middle line:84%
because laughter was
currency in our family.

00:09:01.130 --> 00:09:03.610 align:middle line:84%
If we were not making fun
of you, we didn't like you.

00:09:03.610 --> 00:09:05.030 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Right.

00:09:05.030 --> 00:09:07.460 align:middle line:84%
>> VALENTINE: So in a
jokingly loving way.

00:09:07.460 --> 00:09:10.970 align:middle line:84%
And so I had this guardian
angel who was loving

00:09:10.970 --> 00:09:12.880 align:middle line:84%
and the big brother
kind of thing

00:09:12.880 --> 00:09:14.790 align:middle line:84%
but then would make
fun of me and tease me.

00:09:14.790 --> 00:09:17.000 align:middle line:84%
And so I had this whole
relationship with him

00:09:17.000 --> 00:09:20.150 align:middle line:84%
that anyone else who had an
older brother like that would

00:09:20.150 --> 00:09:23.180 align:middle line:90%
probably think was horrible.

00:09:23.180 --> 00:09:24.470 align:middle line:90%
Right.

00:09:24.470 --> 00:09:26.790 align:middle line:90%
But for me it's what I needed.

00:09:26.790 --> 00:09:29.630 align:middle line:84%
And so I first
encountered Joshua

00:09:29.630 --> 00:09:32.270 align:middle line:90%
when I was five, like I said.

00:09:32.270 --> 00:09:35.090 align:middle line:84%
And I looked out
my bedroom window

00:09:35.090 --> 00:09:38.420 align:middle line:84%
to see the neighbor's
house on fire.

00:09:38.420 --> 00:09:40.588 align:middle line:84%
And I saw the man who
owned the house come

00:09:40.588 --> 00:09:41.630 align:middle line:90%
running out of the house.

00:09:41.630 --> 00:09:43.800 align:middle line:90%
And he was on fire.

00:09:43.800 --> 00:09:45.890 align:middle line:90%
And so this was quite traumatic.

00:09:45.890 --> 00:09:47.680 align:middle line:90%
But Joshua roused me.

00:09:47.680 --> 00:09:50.280 align:middle line:84%
He's the one who woke me
and said, go to the window.

00:09:50.280 --> 00:09:51.350 align:middle line:90%
Go to the window.

00:09:51.350 --> 00:09:54.650 align:middle line:84%
The thing that was really wacky
about it is that later on once

00:09:54.650 --> 00:09:56.855 align:middle line:84%
I was willing to
go back upstairs,

00:09:56.855 --> 00:09:59.480 align:middle line:84%
my mother pointed out to me you
cannot see that house from this

00:09:59.480 --> 00:10:00.280 align:middle line:90%
window.

00:10:00.280 --> 00:10:01.080 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Hmm.

00:10:01.080 --> 00:10:03.630 align:middle line:84%
>> VALENTINE: And that's when
she sat me down and said, OK,

00:10:03.630 --> 00:10:05.785 align:middle line:90%
we have something fun going on.

00:10:05.785 --> 00:10:07.910 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: And your mom
was very embracing of this.

00:10:07.910 --> 00:10:10.130 align:middle line:84%
>> VALENTINE: My mom was
always embracing of everything.

00:10:10.130 --> 00:10:11.780 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: Well, let's talk
about the South because you

00:10:11.780 --> 00:10:13.430 align:middle line:90%
have a real dichotomy there.

00:10:13.430 --> 00:10:16.520 align:middle line:84%
There's a lot of belief
in, what do you call it,

00:10:16.520 --> 00:10:18.530 align:middle line:84%
like superstitions
and things like that

00:10:18.530 --> 00:10:21.780 align:middle line:84%
woven into the culture which
have metaphysical properties.

00:10:21.780 --> 00:10:23.250 align:middle line:90%
Superstitions too.

00:10:23.250 --> 00:10:25.050 align:middle line:84%
At the same time, you
have a lot of really

00:10:25.050 --> 00:10:26.650 align:middle line:84%
fundamentalist
religion going on.

00:10:26.650 --> 00:10:27.450 align:middle line:90%
>> VALENTINE: Yeah.

00:10:27.450 --> 00:10:29.250 align:middle line:90%
For which I was not invited.

00:10:29.250 --> 00:10:30.240 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Yeah.

00:10:30.240 --> 00:10:31.560 align:middle line:90%
>> VALENTINE: So you know.

00:10:31.560 --> 00:10:34.140 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: So it's kind of--
so your mom fell somewhere

00:10:34.140 --> 00:10:35.748 align:middle line:90%
in between or she was--

00:10:35.748 --> 00:10:37.290 align:middle line:84%
>> VALENTINE: You
know, it was funny.

00:10:37.290 --> 00:10:42.060 align:middle line:84%
It's like all of these
women, if you asked them

00:10:42.060 --> 00:10:45.130 align:middle line:84%
what they believed, it
would be Christianity.

00:10:45.130 --> 00:10:47.790 align:middle line:84%
If you asked them how
the universe worked,

00:10:47.790 --> 00:10:48.840 align:middle line:90%
you got mysticism.

00:10:48.840 --> 00:10:49.290 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Yeah.

00:10:49.290 --> 00:10:50.090 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:10:50.090 --> 00:10:52.140 align:middle line:84%
I find it really an
interesting dichotomy.

00:10:52.140 --> 00:10:53.400 align:middle line:90%
But it shouldn't be.

00:10:53.400 --> 00:10:55.050 align:middle line:84%
>> VALENTINE: Well, I think
that was partially the Cherokee

00:10:55.050 --> 00:10:55.850 align:middle line:90%
thing.

00:10:55.850 --> 00:10:56.650 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:10:56.650 --> 00:10:58.810 align:middle line:84%
You know, it's a very
mystical belief system.

00:10:58.810 --> 00:10:59.610 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Yeah.

00:10:59.610 --> 00:11:02.730 align:middle line:84%
>> VALENTINE: And so I
think that was going on.

00:11:02.730 --> 00:11:04.400 align:middle line:84%
But you know, we
pick our parents.

00:11:04.400 --> 00:11:05.200 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Yes.

00:11:05.200 --> 00:11:07.190 align:middle line:90%
>> VALENTINE: And I needed that.

00:11:07.190 --> 00:11:07.990 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Yeah.

00:11:07.990 --> 00:11:08.790 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:11:08.790 --> 00:11:10.520 align:middle line:90%
So now you're a kid.

00:11:10.520 --> 00:11:13.140 align:middle line:84%
Your mom says we have something
fun and special going on.

00:11:13.140 --> 00:11:15.933 align:middle line:84%
How did you begin developing it
and playing with it initially?

00:11:15.933 --> 00:11:17.850 align:middle line:84%
>> VALENTINE: You know,
I just paid attention.

00:11:17.850 --> 00:11:19.017 align:middle line:90%
I knew who was on the phone.

00:11:19.017 --> 00:11:20.460 align:middle line:90%
I knew if someone was lying.

00:11:20.460 --> 00:11:22.090 align:middle line:90%
I'd go, "Mom."

00:11:22.090 --> 00:11:22.890 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Yeah.

00:11:22.890 --> 00:11:23.848 align:middle line:90%
>> VALENTINE: You know.

00:11:23.848 --> 00:11:26.040 align:middle line:90%
And I paid attention to it.

00:11:26.040 --> 00:11:31.198 align:middle line:84%
It did go into remission
or a quietness for me

00:11:31.198 --> 00:11:32.240 align:middle line:90%
as I went through school.

00:11:32.240 --> 00:11:32.890 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: Which
is kind of normal.

00:11:32.890 --> 00:11:33.240 align:middle line:90%
>> VALENTINE: It is.

00:11:33.240 --> 00:11:34.040 align:middle line:90%
It is.

00:11:34.040 --> 00:11:36.030 align:middle line:84%
Because I was in school
and my main thing

00:11:36.030 --> 00:11:40.710 align:middle line:84%
was if I tuned in to anybody, it
was there's Radleigh the Sissy

00:11:40.710 --> 00:11:42.030 align:middle line:90%
and they hate me.

00:11:42.030 --> 00:11:46.080 align:middle line:84%
And so I really did not
want to be tuning into that.

00:11:46.080 --> 00:11:49.730 align:middle line:84%
Teachers loved me
but the kids did not.

00:11:49.730 --> 00:11:52.980 align:middle line:84%
And so it really wasn't
until I was in my early 20s

00:11:52.980 --> 00:11:56.580 align:middle line:84%
when I started to,
because people that I knew

00:11:56.580 --> 00:12:00.420 align:middle line:84%
were being kicked out of their
churches for their gayness.

00:12:00.420 --> 00:12:02.010 align:middle line:90%
And it was like, OK.

00:12:02.010 --> 00:12:03.570 align:middle line:84%
This is never going
to work for me.

00:12:03.570 --> 00:12:05.220 align:middle line:84%
I'm never going to
be accepted here,

00:12:05.220 --> 00:12:07.950 align:middle line:84%
because I did not know I was
ever going to leave Tennessee

00:12:07.950 --> 00:12:09.160 align:middle line:90%
at that moment.

00:12:09.160 --> 00:12:11.430 align:middle line:84%
And so that's when I
started reaching out.

00:12:11.430 --> 00:12:14.010 align:middle line:84%
And there was
nowhere to reach out.

00:12:14.010 --> 00:12:14.810 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Yeah.

00:12:14.810 --> 00:12:15.280 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:12:15.280 --> 00:12:16.890 align:middle line:84%
>> VALENTINE: But
there was the internet.

00:12:16.890 --> 00:12:17.690 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Yeah.

00:12:17.690 --> 00:12:20.520 align:middle line:84%
>> VALENTINE: And so I
started finding teachers

00:12:20.520 --> 00:12:22.030 align:middle line:90%
on the internet.

00:12:22.030 --> 00:12:25.500 align:middle line:84%
And so that's when I really
started to redevelop it.

00:12:25.500 --> 00:12:27.210 align:middle line:90%
It really started to reawaken.

00:12:27.210 --> 00:12:28.710 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Did you
have certain tools

00:12:28.710 --> 00:12:29.770 align:middle line:90%
you started playing with first?

00:12:29.770 --> 00:12:31.062 align:middle line:90%
>>VALENTINE: Oh, it was angels.

00:12:31.062 --> 00:12:32.790 align:middle line:84%
I mean, I went
straight to angels.

00:12:32.790 --> 00:12:35.820 align:middle line:84%
And the thing that was super
cool was that I had my very

00:12:35.820 --> 00:12:38.580 align:middle line:84%
first teacher was this
woman who taught angels ,

00:12:38.580 --> 00:12:40.170 align:middle line:90%
whose name was Carla Flack.

00:12:40.170 --> 00:12:42.880 align:middle line:90%
And she loved tarot.

00:12:42.880 --> 00:12:43.680 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:12:43.680 --> 00:12:46.200 align:middle line:84%
>>VALENTINE: Which most people
think of angels and tarot

00:12:46.200 --> 00:12:48.060 align:middle line:90%
as being strange bedfellows.

00:12:48.060 --> 00:12:49.268 align:middle line:90%
At least, they did back then.

00:12:49.268 --> 00:12:50.352 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah, back then.

00:12:50.352 --> 00:12:52.890 align:middle line:84%
>>VALENTINE: And once Carla
started teaching me tarot,

00:12:52.890 --> 00:12:57.010 align:middle line:84%
and I became fascinated,
because I was good at it.

00:12:57.010 --> 00:12:57.810 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:12:57.810 --> 00:13:01.050 align:middle line:84%
>>VALENTINE: You know, I was
like, wow, this is super cool.

00:13:01.050 --> 00:13:03.900 align:middle line:84%
But it was also,
back then, it was

00:13:03.900 --> 00:13:05.940 align:middle line:84%
like Rider-Waite
or nothing, which

00:13:05.940 --> 00:13:09.400 align:middle line:84%
is the guy with 10 swords in his
bag, laying in a pool of blood

00:13:09.400 --> 00:13:12.370 align:middle line:84%
just to say this
situation's over.

00:13:12.370 --> 00:13:13.300 align:middle line:90%
Little harsh.

00:13:13.300 --> 00:13:14.100 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:13:14.100 --> 00:13:16.360 align:middle line:84%
We're going to get into
tarot in just a little bit.

00:13:16.360 --> 00:13:18.027 align:middle line:84%
I have a couple other
questions for you,

00:13:18.027 --> 00:13:21.060 align:middle line:84%
because you decided
in doing tarot,

00:13:21.060 --> 00:13:24.630 align:middle line:84%
it was time to eliminate some of
the really darker cards, right?

00:13:24.630 --> 00:13:26.590 align:middle line:84%
>>VALENTINE: Well,
not eliminate, to--

00:13:26.590 --> 00:13:27.480 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Transform?

00:13:27.480 --> 00:13:28.280 align:middle line:90%
>>VALENTINE: Yeah.

00:13:28.280 --> 00:13:30.840 align:middle line:84%
To realign them with
their true meaning.

00:13:30.840 --> 00:13:32.790 align:middle line:84%
There was a death card
that didn't mean death.

00:13:32.790 --> 00:13:33.960 align:middle line:90%
So why is it called death?

00:13:33.960 --> 00:13:35.830 align:middle line:84%
There was a devil
card that there

00:13:35.830 --> 00:13:38.310 align:middle line:84%
is no guy in a red suit
going to chase you around.

00:13:38.310 --> 00:13:38.670 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:13:38.670 --> 00:13:40.545 align:middle line:84%
>>VALENTINE: So it was
basically just looking

00:13:40.545 --> 00:13:43.710 align:middle line:84%
at these things and the harshest
of imageries and saying,

00:13:43.710 --> 00:13:44.775 align:middle line:90%
this is pointless.

00:13:44.775 --> 00:13:45.900 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: I agree with you.

00:13:45.900 --> 00:13:47.733 align:middle line:84%
Because one of the
things that turned me off

00:13:47.733 --> 00:13:49.660 align:middle line:84%
to tarot very early on
were those exact cards.

00:13:49.660 --> 00:13:50.160 align:middle line:90%
>>VALENTINE: Yeah.

00:13:50.160 --> 00:13:52.660 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: It's like, oh my god,
I hope I don't get the devil

00:13:52.660 --> 00:13:53.820 align:middle line:90%
or death card, you know?

00:13:53.820 --> 00:13:55.740 align:middle line:84%
And people are
afraid, obviously,

00:13:55.740 --> 00:13:57.310 align:middle line:90%
afraid by the imagery alone.

00:13:57.310 --> 00:13:58.110 align:middle line:90%
>>VALENTINE: Right.

00:13:58.110 --> 00:14:00.280 align:middle line:84%
And as a reader, I
would find myself going,

00:14:00.280 --> 00:14:01.590 align:middle line:90%
OK, here's the death card.

00:14:01.590 --> 00:14:03.630 align:middle line:84%
All it really means is
a significant ending

00:14:03.630 --> 00:14:04.630 align:middle line:90%
in your life.

00:14:04.630 --> 00:14:06.010 align:middle line:90%
And I'm like trying to hide it.

00:14:06.010 --> 00:14:07.380 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Right, so the
people can't see it.

00:14:07.380 --> 00:14:08.500 align:middle line:84%
>>VALENTINE: So that the
person across from me

00:14:08.500 --> 00:14:09.690 align:middle line:90%
is not hyperventilating.

00:14:09.690 --> 00:14:10.173 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:14:10.173 --> 00:14:11.140 align:middle line:90%
>>VALENTINE: You know?

00:14:11.140 --> 00:14:11.513 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Death card.

00:14:11.513 --> 00:14:11.740 align:middle line:90%
Who's dying?

00:14:11.740 --> 00:14:13.698 align:middle line:84%
>>VALENTINE: And is
falling out of their chair.

00:14:13.698 --> 00:14:14.890 align:middle line:90%
It's like, nobody's dying.

00:14:14.890 --> 00:14:16.290 align:middle line:90%
Nobody is dying.

00:14:16.290 --> 00:14:17.090 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:14:17.090 --> 00:14:19.297 align:middle line:84%
OK, so now, you had a
little detour in your life

00:14:19.297 --> 00:14:20.880 align:middle line:84%
because you kind of
went left-brained.

00:14:20.880 --> 00:14:21.820 align:middle line:90%
I mean, right?

00:14:21.820 --> 00:14:22.290 align:middle line:90%
>>VALENTINE: Yeah.

00:14:22.290 --> 00:14:23.570 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Certified
public accountant.

00:14:23.570 --> 00:14:23.900 align:middle line:90%
>>VALENTINE: Yeah.

00:14:23.900 --> 00:14:24.410 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:14:24.410 --> 00:14:25.230 align:middle line:90%
Right.

00:14:25.230 --> 00:14:26.430 align:middle line:90%
I just threw that in there.

00:14:26.430 --> 00:14:27.570 align:middle line:90%
And everyone's like, what?

00:14:27.570 --> 00:14:28.440 align:middle line:90%
>>VALENTINE: I know.

00:14:28.440 --> 00:14:29.280 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: After
everything you've

00:14:29.280 --> 00:14:31.850 align:middle line:84%
just said, how did you become
a certified public accountant?

00:14:31.850 --> 00:14:34.175 align:middle line:84%
>>VALENTINE: You know, do
you want the real reason?

00:14:34.175 --> 00:14:35.550 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: I want
the real reason.

00:14:35.550 --> 00:14:36.420 align:middle line:90%
I want the story.

00:14:36.420 --> 00:14:36.510 align:middle line:84%
>>VALENTINE: All right,
here's the real reason.

00:14:36.510 --> 00:14:37.810 align:middle line:90%
All right, here's the story.

00:14:37.810 --> 00:14:41.940 align:middle line:84%
So I went to school to
major in music and dance.

00:14:41.940 --> 00:14:43.650 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Right,
which naturally leads

00:14:43.650 --> 00:14:44.290 align:middle line:90%
you to become an accountant.

00:14:44.290 --> 00:14:46.350 align:middle line:84%
>>VALENTINE: An accountant,
of course, it does.

00:14:46.350 --> 00:14:47.190 align:middle line:90%
It's the gateway.

00:14:47.190 --> 00:14:47.990 align:middle line:90%
Right?

00:14:47.990 --> 00:14:50.640 align:middle line:90%
It's the gateway to CPA.

00:14:50.640 --> 00:14:53.790 align:middle line:84%
But actually, I had all
these friends coming back

00:14:53.790 --> 00:14:57.720 align:middle line:84%
from New York in tattered
tights, and they're starving.

00:14:57.720 --> 00:15:01.590 align:middle line:84%
And I'm like, this isn't feeling
like a good career move to me.

00:15:01.590 --> 00:15:03.400 align:middle line:90%
Maybe I won't do this.

00:15:03.400 --> 00:15:05.527 align:middle line:84%
And this is so gay of
me, but there was my--

00:15:05.527 --> 00:15:06.360 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: That's OK.

00:15:06.360 --> 00:15:07.160 align:middle line:90%
You're gay.

00:15:07.160 --> 00:15:08.730 align:middle line:90%
>>VALENTINE: I know.

00:15:08.730 --> 00:15:13.290 align:middle line:84%
The resident assistant
in my dorm was so hot.

00:15:13.290 --> 00:15:15.690 align:middle line:84%
I just was like dreamy
swooning over him.

00:15:15.690 --> 00:15:16.970 align:middle line:90%
Guess what he was studying?

00:15:16.970 --> 00:15:17.770 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:15:17.770 --> 00:15:18.790 align:middle line:90%
OK, there you go.

00:15:18.790 --> 00:15:20.707 align:middle line:84%
>>VALENTINE: Accounting,
so I took accounting.

00:15:20.707 --> 00:15:24.790 align:middle line:84%
And I got through the first
class, accounting 101.

00:15:24.790 --> 00:15:27.940 align:middle line:84%
I went into the finals
with 103 average.

00:15:27.940 --> 00:15:30.570 align:middle line:84%
And I was like, oh,
I'm good at this.

00:15:30.570 --> 00:15:31.480 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:15:31.480 --> 00:15:34.090 align:middle line:84%
>>VALENTINE: And so, by the
time I got to my junior year

00:15:34.090 --> 00:15:36.340 align:middle line:84%
and came to my
senses, I realized, I

00:15:36.340 --> 00:15:37.360 align:middle line:90%
can't change majors.

00:15:37.360 --> 00:15:38.890 align:middle line:90%
I don't have the money.

00:15:38.890 --> 00:15:40.420 align:middle line:90%
But it served me.

00:15:40.420 --> 00:15:44.340 align:middle line:84%
Ironically, my first job was
with a publishing company.

00:15:44.340 --> 00:15:45.140 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Perfect.

00:15:45.140 --> 00:15:46.150 align:middle line:90%
>>VALENTINE: Perfect.

00:15:46.150 --> 00:15:48.640 align:middle line:90%
And it just it served me.

00:15:48.640 --> 00:15:50.470 align:middle line:90%
I learned so much.

00:15:50.470 --> 00:15:54.490 align:middle line:84%
And so many people who are in
the metaphysical, spiritual

00:15:54.490 --> 00:15:58.900 align:middle line:84%
world as teachers or authors
are so ungrounded on this topic.

00:15:58.900 --> 00:15:59.912 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Absolutely.

00:15:59.912 --> 00:16:01.370 align:middle line:84%
>>VALENTINE:
Completely ungrounded.

00:16:01.370 --> 00:16:05.860 align:middle line:84%
They are lost in space when it
comes to managing their money

00:16:05.860 --> 00:16:06.710 align:middle line:90%
and stuff like that.

00:16:06.710 --> 00:16:10.270 align:middle line:84%
And so, I consider
it a blessing that I

00:16:10.270 --> 00:16:12.110 align:middle line:90%
have both of these things.

00:16:12.110 --> 00:16:12.910 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:16:12.910 --> 00:16:15.550 align:middle line:84%
Well, what about because,
as you say, turns out

00:16:15.550 --> 00:16:16.460 align:middle line:90%
you were good at it.

00:16:16.460 --> 00:16:17.260 align:middle line:90%
>>VALENTINE: Yeah.

00:16:17.260 --> 00:16:19.570 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So what about
numbers themselves,

00:16:19.570 --> 00:16:22.150 align:middle line:84%
the kind of truthfulness
behind numbers?

00:16:22.150 --> 00:16:26.380 align:middle line:84%
Did you find that there was
a kind of beauty in numbers?

00:16:26.380 --> 00:16:28.210 align:middle line:84%
>>VALENTINE: I
liked the puzzles.

00:16:28.210 --> 00:16:33.660 align:middle line:84%
To me, it was a puzzle, because
it all has to balance in this,

00:16:33.660 --> 00:16:35.372 align:middle line:90%
I'm not this much of a nerd, OK?

00:16:35.372 --> 00:16:36.580 align:middle line:90%
Well, actually, I kind of am.

00:16:36.580 --> 00:16:41.440 align:middle line:84%
But it's like there
is a magic to the fact

00:16:41.440 --> 00:16:43.150 align:middle line:90%
that it all has to balance.

00:16:43.150 --> 00:16:45.980 align:middle line:84%
It all has to come together
or you did it wrong.

00:16:45.980 --> 00:16:46.780 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:16:46.780 --> 00:16:48.242 align:middle line:90%
>>VALENTINE: And I liked that.

00:16:48.242 --> 00:16:49.200 align:middle line:90%
I really did like that.

00:16:49.200 --> 00:16:55.300 align:middle line:84%
But where I excelled, to be
honest, was in managing people.

00:16:55.300 --> 00:16:57.520 align:middle line:84%
I was an amazing
manager of people.

00:16:57.520 --> 00:17:00.310 align:middle line:84%
And so, as I went
through my career,

00:17:00.310 --> 00:17:04.060 align:middle line:84%
it became less debits and
credits and less putting teams

00:17:04.060 --> 00:17:04.930 align:middle line:90%
together.

00:17:04.930 --> 00:17:08.589 align:middle line:84%
And I was using Radleigh's
little special gift

00:17:08.589 --> 00:17:09.470 align:middle line:90%
to hire people.

00:17:09.470 --> 00:17:10.270 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:17:10.270 --> 00:17:12.130 align:middle line:84%
>>VALENTINE: Because I
would know it's like,

00:17:12.130 --> 00:17:13.279 align:middle line:90%
you're a good one.

00:17:13.279 --> 00:17:14.079 align:middle line:90%
I'll take you.

00:17:14.079 --> 00:17:14.890 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:17:14.890 --> 00:17:17.560 align:middle line:84%
>>VALENTINE: And plus, I
had the whole understanding

00:17:17.560 --> 00:17:19.130 align:middle line:90%
of diversity.

00:17:19.130 --> 00:17:23.920 align:middle line:84%
And so, I would hire like a
series of accounting managers

00:17:23.920 --> 00:17:26.200 align:middle line:90%
that needed each other.

00:17:26.200 --> 00:17:28.150 align:middle line:90%
This dude was the SEC dude.

00:17:28.150 --> 00:17:30.370 align:middle line:84%
But this girl knows
nothing about SEC.

00:17:30.370 --> 00:17:34.570 align:middle line:84%
But she can wrap you around
her finger like that.

00:17:34.570 --> 00:17:35.990 align:middle line:90%
And he can't.

00:17:35.990 --> 00:17:38.860 align:middle line:84%
And I literally had people from
the marketing department come

00:17:38.860 --> 00:17:41.110 align:middle line:84%
to me and say, will
you hire my staff?

00:17:41.110 --> 00:17:43.660 align:middle line:84%
And I'm like, I don't know
anything about marketing.

00:17:43.660 --> 00:17:45.250 align:middle line:90%
And they're like, we don't care.

00:17:45.250 --> 00:17:48.520 align:middle line:84%
When I left accounting, I had
150 people working for me.

00:17:48.520 --> 00:17:49.630 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Wow.

00:17:49.630 --> 00:17:50.500 align:middle line:90%
>>VALENTINE: Yeah.

00:17:50.500 --> 00:17:55.300 align:middle line:84%
And I had the happiest
team of any department.

00:17:55.300 --> 00:17:57.100 align:middle line:90%
And they were productive.

00:17:57.100 --> 00:17:58.600 align:middle line:90%
And they loved each other.

00:17:58.600 --> 00:18:02.630 align:middle line:84%
But I was using that sixth sense
to put these teams together.

00:18:02.630 --> 00:18:03.430 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:18:03.430 --> 00:18:03.640 align:middle line:90%
No.

00:18:03.640 --> 00:18:04.440 align:middle line:90%
Absolutely.

00:18:04.440 --> 00:18:05.370 align:middle line:90%
I can see that.

00:18:05.370 --> 00:18:07.870 align:middle line:84%
I mean, that's what
every corporation needs

00:18:07.870 --> 00:18:09.060 align:middle line:90%
is someone who can do that.

00:18:09.060 --> 00:18:10.480 align:middle line:84%
>>VALENTINE: Well, and
that's why I was popular.

00:18:10.480 --> 00:18:11.320 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:18:11.320 --> 00:18:14.860 align:middle line:84%
>>VALENTINE: Suddenly, I went
from my childhood being the way

00:18:14.860 --> 00:18:18.070 align:middle line:90%
it was to being here I am.

00:18:18.070 --> 00:18:20.020 align:middle line:90%
Like everybody wants to hire me.

00:18:20.020 --> 00:18:20.890 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:18:20.890 --> 00:18:22.510 align:middle line:84%
You know, this whole
thing about how

00:18:22.510 --> 00:18:24.220 align:middle line:84%
to order a corporation
in the right way,

00:18:24.220 --> 00:18:26.590 align:middle line:84%
because so many of
them are done poorly.

00:18:26.590 --> 00:18:29.500 align:middle line:84%
There was a man I interviewed
years ago named Rob Williams,

00:18:29.500 --> 00:18:31.960 align:middle line:84%
and he served as,
what he called,

00:18:31.960 --> 00:18:34.330 align:middle line:84%
the CSO or chief
shamanic officer.

00:18:34.330 --> 00:18:35.350 align:middle line:90%
>>VALENTINE: Oh, yay.

00:18:35.350 --> 00:18:36.150 align:middle line:90%
Good title.

00:18:36.150 --> 00:18:37.750 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And was
talking about how

00:18:37.750 --> 00:18:40.582 align:middle line:84%
this was so necessary
in the world of business

00:18:40.582 --> 00:18:42.040 align:middle line:84%
to have people like
you, people who

00:18:42.040 --> 00:18:44.470 align:middle line:84%
can see underneath
things, behind things,

00:18:44.470 --> 00:18:48.370 align:middle line:84%
and see the deeper truth, and
have a position for someone who

00:18:48.370 --> 00:18:50.170 align:middle line:90%
can do that on staff.

00:18:50.170 --> 00:18:52.720 align:middle line:84%
So I can see why you
were just pure gold.

00:18:52.720 --> 00:18:54.270 align:middle line:84%
>>VALENTINE: Well,
and I was fun.

00:18:54.270 --> 00:18:54.530 align:middle line:90%
You know?

00:18:54.530 --> 00:18:55.330 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:18:55.330 --> 00:19:00.062 align:middle line:84%
>>VALENTINE: It's like
accountants can be dry or fun.

00:19:00.062 --> 00:19:01.830 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: They can be fun.

00:19:01.830 --> 00:19:04.170 align:middle line:84%
OK, well, let's talk about
numerology, numbers, numbers,

00:19:04.170 --> 00:19:04.970 align:middle line:90%
numbers.

00:19:04.970 --> 00:19:07.900 align:middle line:84%
I thought might you have
had a unique relationship

00:19:07.900 --> 00:19:11.740 align:middle line:84%
to numerology because
of your life in numbers.

00:19:11.740 --> 00:19:13.720 align:middle line:90%
>>VALENTINE: Not necessarily.

00:19:13.720 --> 00:19:17.710 align:middle line:84%
It's kind of like even
though I was an accountant,

00:19:17.710 --> 00:19:19.270 align:middle line:90%
I didn't do my own taxes.

00:19:19.270 --> 00:19:20.570 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah, OK, gotcha.

00:19:20.570 --> 00:19:23.560 align:middle line:84%
>>VALENTINE: And so, if I was
going to go after spirituality,

00:19:23.560 --> 00:19:27.160 align:middle line:84%
if I was going to go after
the right side of my brain,

00:19:27.160 --> 00:19:28.550 align:middle line:90%
I didn't want to like--

00:19:28.550 --> 00:19:29.350 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:19:29.350 --> 00:19:31.390 align:middle line:84%
>>VALENTINE: So I
studied numerology.

00:19:31.390 --> 00:19:32.687 align:middle line:90%
I learned about it.

00:19:32.687 --> 00:19:35.270 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: But there was no kind
of natural crossover affinity.

00:19:35.270 --> 00:19:35.755 align:middle line:90%
>>VALENTINE: It wasn't.

00:19:35.755 --> 00:19:36.100 align:middle line:90%
No.

00:19:36.100 --> 00:19:38.170 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Well, OK, so let's
go back to tarot for a minute.

00:19:38.170 --> 00:19:39.670 align:middle line:90%
So you're fascinated with tarot.

00:19:39.670 --> 00:19:40.030 align:middle line:90%
>>VALENTINE: Yeah.

00:19:40.030 --> 00:19:41.925 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Now you've
decided to perfect

00:19:41.925 --> 00:19:44.020 align:middle line:90%
or refine the scary cards.

00:19:44.020 --> 00:19:44.820 align:middle line:90%
>>VALENTINE: Yeah.

00:19:44.820 --> 00:19:46.240 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: OK, and let's
go further into it.

00:19:46.240 --> 00:19:48.282 align:middle line:84%
>>VALENTINE: Well, I mean,
really what it was was

00:19:48.282 --> 00:19:50.590 align:middle line:84%
I wanted the deck that
I had always wanted.

00:19:50.590 --> 00:19:53.320 align:middle line:84%
That's really what
it boiled down to.

00:19:53.320 --> 00:19:57.550 align:middle line:84%
Because it took me, I mean, I
have like 70 something decks

00:19:57.550 --> 00:20:01.060 align:middle line:84%
at home in a box, mostly
because I would buy the deck

00:20:01.060 --> 00:20:04.360 align:middle line:84%
and go, eh, and
there it would go.

00:20:04.360 --> 00:20:09.340 align:middle line:84%
And so, I really, really
wanted people not to be afraid.

00:20:09.340 --> 00:20:14.500 align:middle line:84%
I consider my twin life purposes
to be to take the fear out

00:20:14.500 --> 00:20:18.240 align:middle line:84%
of spirituality and show people
how to have a magical life.

00:20:18.240 --> 00:20:20.520 align:middle line:90%
That's what I really get off on.

00:20:20.520 --> 00:20:21.750 align:middle line:90%
I love that.

00:20:21.750 --> 00:20:23.910 align:middle line:84%
And I didn't want
to water down ,

00:20:23.910 --> 00:20:26.690 align:middle line:84%
tarot because then
it's not very useful.

00:20:26.690 --> 00:20:27.490 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:20:27.490 --> 00:20:30.510 align:middle line:84%
>>VALENTINE: Because
tarot represents life.

00:20:30.510 --> 00:20:32.430 align:middle line:90%
Sorrow happens in life.

00:20:32.430 --> 00:20:34.200 align:middle line:90%
You can't take it out.

00:20:34.200 --> 00:20:36.120 align:middle line:84%
But it doesn't
have to be a heart

00:20:36.120 --> 00:20:38.339 align:middle line:84%
with three swords with blood
dripping out the bottom.

00:20:38.339 --> 00:20:39.381 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right, exactly.

00:20:39.381 --> 00:20:39.840 align:middle line:90%
>>VALENTINE: You know?

00:20:39.840 --> 00:20:41.340 align:middle line:90%
It doesn't have to be that.

00:20:41.340 --> 00:20:44.460 align:middle line:84%
That's a hold back
to 600 years ago when

00:20:44.460 --> 00:20:46.290 align:middle line:90%
tarot started getting created.

00:20:46.290 --> 00:20:48.010 align:middle line:90%
And it was a tough time.

00:20:48.010 --> 00:20:51.700 align:middle line:84%
It was rough in life, and
people were illiterate.

00:20:51.700 --> 00:20:55.310 align:middle line:84%
And so, they needed something
really graphic to explain it.

00:20:55.310 --> 00:20:56.790 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Visceral, yeah.

00:20:56.790 --> 00:20:59.850 align:middle line:84%
>>VALENTINE: And what my
perception was that, well,

00:20:59.850 --> 00:21:02.400 align:middle line:84%
we've had 600 years
to evolve, because I

00:21:02.400 --> 00:21:04.050 align:middle line:90%
believe in reincarnation.

00:21:04.050 --> 00:21:05.580 align:middle line:84%
What I'm looking
around and seeing

00:21:05.580 --> 00:21:06.955 align:middle line:84%
is a whole bunch
of people who've

00:21:06.955 --> 00:21:10.740 align:middle line:84%
gone through enough lifetimes
to be incredibly sensitive,

00:21:10.740 --> 00:21:13.110 align:middle line:90%
incredibly sensitive.

00:21:13.110 --> 00:21:17.100 align:middle line:84%
And they may have this
sense of remembering tarot

00:21:17.100 --> 00:21:19.530 align:middle line:84%
from a past life when
they could tolerate it.

00:21:19.530 --> 00:21:23.250 align:middle line:84%
But now, they're looking at
it and going, not so much.

00:21:23.250 --> 00:21:24.960 align:middle line:90%
And we have television.

00:21:24.960 --> 00:21:27.000 align:middle line:84%
When was the last time
you saw a show or a movie

00:21:27.000 --> 00:21:29.440 align:middle line:84%
where the card that
flipped down wasn't death?

00:21:29.440 --> 00:21:32.400 align:middle line:84%
Really, it's just the only
card they have, right?

00:21:32.400 --> 00:21:34.365 align:middle line:84%
They've got it in a
stockroom somewhere.

00:21:34.365 --> 00:21:35.390 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah, right.

00:21:35.390 --> 00:21:36.320 align:middle line:84%
>>VALENTINE: It's the
only one they have.

00:21:36.320 --> 00:21:37.500 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: It's the
only death card.

00:21:37.500 --> 00:21:38.650 align:middle line:90%
>>VALENTINE: That's right.

00:21:38.650 --> 00:21:42.520 align:middle line:84%
And so, I wanted to, first
of all, take the fear out.

00:21:42.520 --> 00:21:43.320 align:middle line:90%
OK?

00:21:43.320 --> 00:21:45.400 align:middle line:84%
So go through, and
it's like, fine,

00:21:45.400 --> 00:21:49.840 align:middle line:84%
we don't need the heart with
the blood running through it.

00:21:49.840 --> 00:21:55.380 align:middle line:84%
What about an arc angel holding
a woman in a gentle embrace

00:21:55.380 --> 00:21:57.310 align:middle line:90%
while she cries on his shoulder?

00:21:57.310 --> 00:21:58.110 align:middle line:90%
OK?

00:21:58.110 --> 00:22:01.380 align:middle line:84%
Same message, sorrow,
sadness, but also

00:22:01.380 --> 00:22:04.810 align:middle line:84%
adding the message of angels
are with you, and they love you,

00:22:04.810 --> 00:22:06.440 align:middle line:84%
and that will help
you get through it.

00:22:06.440 --> 00:22:07.410 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: I love it.

00:22:07.410 --> 00:22:09.720 align:middle line:84%
>>VALENTINE: When I was
learning tarot in my 20s,

00:22:09.720 --> 00:22:12.990 align:middle line:84%
I finally found a deck I could
tolerate, so I bought two.

00:22:12.990 --> 00:22:15.450 align:middle line:84%
And I took a black
Sharpie and I wrote

00:22:15.450 --> 00:22:17.910 align:middle line:84%
on every card what they
mean, because there's

00:22:17.910 --> 00:22:18.990 align:middle line:90%
no words on tarot.

00:22:18.990 --> 00:22:22.260 align:middle line:84%
It was done that way
to scare you out of it,

00:22:22.260 --> 00:22:24.580 align:middle line:84%
to make you think,
you can't do this.

00:22:24.580 --> 00:22:29.220 align:middle line:84%
It's too hard, to memorize
all these multiple meanings.

00:22:29.220 --> 00:22:31.500 align:middle line:84%
And so, when I
created my first deck,

00:22:31.500 --> 00:22:33.120 align:middle line:84%
I was like, I did
that for myself.

00:22:33.120 --> 00:22:34.530 align:middle line:90%
I'm going to do it for them.

00:22:34.530 --> 00:22:37.080 align:middle line:84%
Let's put words, phrases
at the bottom of the card.

00:22:37.080 --> 00:22:40.640 align:middle line:84%
Let's let them open the
box and immediately be

00:22:40.640 --> 00:22:41.440 align:middle line:90%
able to use these.

00:22:41.440 --> 00:22:42.650 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: No, it
makes so much sense.

00:22:42.650 --> 00:22:43.170 align:middle line:90%
>>VALENTINE: Right?

00:22:43.170 --> 00:22:43.610 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:22:43.610 --> 00:22:44.060 align:middle line:90%
>>VALENTINE: Right.

00:22:44.060 --> 00:22:45.180 align:middle line:90%
Make it easy.

00:22:45.180 --> 00:22:46.170 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Because usually,
you have a little book

00:22:46.170 --> 00:22:47.400 align:middle line:90%
that goes along with it.

00:22:47.400 --> 00:22:48.775 align:middle line:84%
Then you have to
go over, and you

00:22:48.775 --> 00:22:50.510 align:middle line:84%
have to look up the
number in the book.

00:22:50.510 --> 00:22:52.950 align:middle line:84%
Yeah, it makes logical sense
to have the information

00:22:52.950 --> 00:22:53.540 align:middle line:90%
right in front of you.

00:22:53.540 --> 00:22:54.560 align:middle line:84%
>>VALENTINE: And
there is a booklet,

00:22:54.560 --> 00:22:56.050 align:middle line:90%
and it's good to read it.

00:22:56.050 --> 00:22:59.790 align:middle line:84%
But I wanted people to be able
to pull them out, use them

00:22:59.790 --> 00:23:01.920 align:middle line:90%
right then, and not be afraid.

00:23:01.920 --> 00:23:02.830 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:23:02.830 --> 00:23:03.630 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:23:03.630 --> 00:23:06.780 align:middle line:84%
So we're going to get into
the notion of interpretation

00:23:06.780 --> 00:23:07.930 align:middle line:90%
when you're reading cards.

00:23:07.930 --> 00:23:09.690 align:middle line:84%
Some people have
intuitive ability.

00:23:09.690 --> 00:23:10.610 align:middle line:90%
Some don't.

00:23:10.610 --> 00:23:11.730 align:middle line:84%
And they're just
left with the words,

00:23:11.730 --> 00:23:13.220 align:middle line:90%
and they're left with the image.

00:23:13.220 --> 00:23:15.760 align:middle line:84%
Well, let's talk about
that for a moment.

00:23:15.760 --> 00:23:18.300 align:middle line:84%
>>VALENTINE: I believe that
anybody can play the piano.

00:23:18.300 --> 00:23:21.330 align:middle line:84%
Maybe not everybody
is a concert pianist.

00:23:21.330 --> 00:23:22.630 align:middle line:90%
But anybody can play the piano.

00:23:22.630 --> 00:23:23.430 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: True.

00:23:23.430 --> 00:23:25.170 align:middle line:84%
>>VALENTINE: I
believe that we all

00:23:25.170 --> 00:23:27.300 align:middle line:84%
have a touch of the
divine within us,

00:23:27.300 --> 00:23:28.860 align:middle line:90%
because that's who we are.

00:23:28.860 --> 00:23:32.270 align:middle line:84%
We have a bit of the magic
of the divine inside us.

00:23:32.270 --> 00:23:36.300 align:middle line:84%
So I believe that
everybody has divine gifts.

00:23:36.300 --> 00:23:39.090 align:middle line:84%
It's do you want
to use them or not?

00:23:39.090 --> 00:23:40.530 align:middle line:90%
Are you afraid of them?

00:23:40.530 --> 00:23:41.820 align:middle line:90%
Are you going to practice?

00:23:41.820 --> 00:23:44.640 align:middle line:84%
Because it is practice,
practice, practice.

00:23:44.640 --> 00:23:48.890 align:middle line:84%
So anybody can do
this if they want it.

00:23:48.890 --> 00:23:51.930 align:middle line:84%
But you were talking about the
whole intuitive part, the thing

00:23:51.930 --> 00:23:54.000 align:middle line:84%
about tarot when I
teach it to my students

00:23:54.000 --> 00:23:56.430 align:middle line:90%
is that, OK, there's a picture.

00:23:56.430 --> 00:23:58.110 align:middle line:90%
There are words.

00:23:58.110 --> 00:24:00.930 align:middle line:84%
And there are meanings
behind all of this.

00:24:00.930 --> 00:24:02.790 align:middle line:90%
There's tons of symbolism.

00:24:02.790 --> 00:24:05.610 align:middle line:84%
You can go down that rabbit
hole if you want about all

00:24:05.610 --> 00:24:06.810 align:middle line:90%
of that symbolism.

00:24:06.810 --> 00:24:08.580 align:middle line:90%
I certainly do.

00:24:08.580 --> 00:24:10.600 align:middle line:90%
Or you can not.

00:24:10.600 --> 00:24:12.720 align:middle line:90%
It's your call.

00:24:12.720 --> 00:24:14.070 align:middle line:90%
But you have to trust.

00:24:14.070 --> 00:24:15.190 align:middle line:90%
You have to have faith.

00:24:15.190 --> 00:24:17.100 align:middle line:10%
You have to look at
the cards and go,

00:24:17.100 --> 00:24:19.680 align:middle line:10%
where are my eyes drawn?

00:24:19.680 --> 00:24:21.570 align:middle line:84%
And I teach my
students, it's like,

00:24:21.570 --> 00:24:23.457 align:middle line:84%
are your eyes drawn
to a particular phrase

00:24:23.457 --> 00:24:24.540 align:middle line:90%
at the bottom of the card?

00:24:24.540 --> 00:24:26.490 align:middle line:84%
Are your eyes drawn
to the picture?

00:24:26.490 --> 00:24:29.740 align:middle line:84%
Are you thinking about
the meaning of the card?

00:24:29.740 --> 00:24:32.010 align:middle line:90%
Where intuitively are you?

00:24:32.010 --> 00:24:34.140 align:middle line:84%
I had a student
just this past week,

00:24:34.140 --> 00:24:38.490 align:middle line:84%
lovely, lovely young
woman and really gifted

00:24:38.490 --> 00:24:41.310 align:middle line:84%
but in her head a
little too much.

00:24:41.310 --> 00:24:43.950 align:middle line:90%
And she pulled the dreamer card.

00:24:43.950 --> 00:24:47.910 align:middle line:84%
And her question was, is my
cat, who just passed over,

00:24:47.910 --> 00:24:50.520 align:middle line:84%
still with me following
me as a guide?

00:24:50.520 --> 00:24:53.380 align:middle line:84%
And she looked at the card and
it says, take a leap of faith.

00:24:53.380 --> 00:24:55.830 align:middle line:84%
You know, go after what you
want, blah, blah, blah, blah.

00:24:55.830 --> 00:24:58.800 align:middle line:84%
And she raises her hand, and
I'm like, what is it dear?

00:24:58.800 --> 00:25:01.090 align:middle line:84%
And she's like, well, this
just doesn't make sense

00:25:01.090 --> 00:25:01.650 align:middle line:90%
to my question.

00:25:01.650 --> 00:25:02.983 align:middle line:90%
And I said, what's the question?

00:25:02.983 --> 00:25:04.530 align:middle line:84%
And she told me,
is my cat with me?

00:25:04.530 --> 00:25:05.460 align:middle line:90%
She just passed over.

00:25:05.460 --> 00:25:07.080 align:middle line:90%
And I said look at the picture.

00:25:07.080 --> 00:25:10.490 align:middle line:84%
And the picture was a
young man with his dog.

00:25:10.490 --> 00:25:12.030 align:middle line:90%
And she started to cry.

00:25:12.030 --> 00:25:12.973 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:25:12.973 --> 00:25:13.890 align:middle line:90%
>>VALENTINE: You know?

00:25:13.890 --> 00:25:15.480 align:middle line:84%
It's just a matter of
getting out of your head.

00:25:15.480 --> 00:25:15.840 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:25:15.840 --> 00:25:16.640 align:middle line:90%
No.

00:25:16.640 --> 00:25:18.930 align:middle line:90%
That's a good explanation.

00:25:18.930 --> 00:25:22.280 align:middle line:84%
OK, tarot cards, so that's why
you did what you did with it.

00:25:22.280 --> 00:25:23.800 align:middle line:90%
That was your journey with them.

00:25:23.800 --> 00:25:23.990 align:middle line:90%
>>VALENTINE: Yeah.

00:25:23.990 --> 00:25:24.620 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: You still do them.

00:25:24.620 --> 00:25:26.000 align:middle line:84%
Do you have new
decks coming out?

00:25:26.000 --> 00:25:26.800 align:middle line:90%
>>VALENTINE: I do.

00:25:26.800 --> 00:25:27.100 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: You do?

00:25:27.100 --> 00:25:28.392 align:middle line:90%
When's the new deck coming out?

00:25:28.392 --> 00:25:30.170 align:middle line:84%
>>VALENTINE: Oh my
gosh, I'm so excited.

00:25:30.170 --> 00:25:31.640 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: I want to see it.

00:25:31.640 --> 00:25:33.770 align:middle line:84%
>>VALENTINE: My newest
deck will be coming out

00:25:33.770 --> 00:25:36.560 align:middle line:90%
in October of 2020.

00:25:36.560 --> 00:25:38.947 align:middle line:84%
And it's called Angel
Guidance Tarot Cards.

00:25:38.947 --> 00:25:40.280 align:middle line:90%
And I am over the moon about it.

00:25:40.280 --> 00:25:43.620 align:middle line:84%
I have got the artist
of the century.

00:25:43.620 --> 00:25:48.650 align:middle line:84%
His name is Dan Craig,
not the 007 guy, sadly.

00:25:48.650 --> 00:25:52.250 align:middle line:84%
But I mean, this
man is so amazing.

00:25:52.250 --> 00:25:53.750 align:middle line:90%
His art is beautiful.

00:25:53.750 --> 00:25:55.800 align:middle line:90%
He's got a dry sense of humor.

00:25:55.800 --> 00:25:58.340 align:middle line:84%
He will make suggestions,
and they're always great.

00:25:58.340 --> 00:26:00.010 align:middle line:90%
But he doesn't fight me.

00:26:00.010 --> 00:26:03.480 align:middle line:84%
And he knows nothing about
tarot, which is what I go for.

00:26:03.480 --> 00:26:04.280 align:middle line:90%
I want that.

00:26:04.280 --> 00:26:05.250 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: You want
interpretation.

00:26:05.250 --> 00:26:06.530 align:middle line:84%
>>VALENTINE: I don't want
people coming and going,

00:26:06.530 --> 00:26:08.025 align:middle line:90%
but where's the bloody heart?

00:26:08.025 --> 00:26:08.200 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:26:08.200 --> 00:26:09.325 align:middle line:90%
>>VALENTINE: It's not here.

00:26:09.325 --> 00:26:11.050 align:middle line:90%
You know?

00:26:11.050 --> 00:26:14.150 align:middle line:84%
And it does some things that
I've never seen done in tarot,

00:26:14.150 --> 00:26:15.410 align:middle line:90%
so I'm excited about that.

00:26:15.410 --> 00:26:18.200 align:middle line:84%
Because after 600 years, if
you can do something new, then

00:26:18.200 --> 00:26:19.160 align:middle line:90%
good on you.

00:26:19.160 --> 00:26:19.960 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:26:19.960 --> 00:26:22.490 align:middle line:84%
>>VALENTINE: And i editorial
right now, which leads to art,

00:26:22.490 --> 00:26:25.560 align:middle line:84%
I am working on ascended
master tarot cards.

00:26:25.560 --> 00:26:28.920 align:middle line:84%
So that's going to come
out in October of 2021.

00:26:28.920 --> 00:26:29.720 align:middle line:90%
So I'm doing that.

00:26:29.720 --> 00:26:29.978 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Good.

00:26:29.978 --> 00:26:30.410 align:middle line:90%
Well, excellent.

00:26:30.410 --> 00:26:31.210 align:middle line:90%
>>VALENTINE: Yes.

00:26:31.210 --> 00:26:33.110 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: OK, so do you
feel good with tarot

00:26:33.110 --> 00:26:35.490 align:middle line:84%
before we move on to runes
and some other things?

00:26:35.490 --> 00:26:35.720 align:middle line:90%
>>VALENTINE: Sure.

00:26:35.720 --> 00:26:37.850 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Because it is a
compendium of magical things.

00:26:37.850 --> 00:26:38.300 align:middle line:90%
>>VALENTINE: It is.

00:26:38.300 --> 00:26:39.675 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Let's
talk about runes.

00:26:39.675 --> 00:26:41.008 align:middle line:90%
>>VALENTINE: Well, it's ancient.

00:26:41.008 --> 00:26:42.110 align:middle line:90%
It's way older than tarot.

00:26:42.110 --> 00:26:42.410 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:26:42.410 --> 00:26:43.827 align:middle line:84%
>>VALENTINE: I
mean, tarot is kind

00:26:43.827 --> 00:26:45.363 align:middle line:84%
of like the baby
of the compendium.

00:26:45.363 --> 00:26:46.163 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:26:46.163 --> 00:26:46.963 align:middle line:90%
No.

00:26:46.963 --> 00:26:48.360 align:middle line:90%
Runes, they feel Stone Age.

00:26:48.360 --> 00:26:50.120 align:middle line:84%
>>VALENTINE: They
do, because they are.

00:26:50.120 --> 00:26:51.080 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:26:51.080 --> 00:26:51.997 align:middle line:90%
>>VALENTINE: They are.

00:26:51.997 --> 00:26:54.680 align:middle line:84%
And in ancient times,
people would carve these

00:26:54.680 --> 00:26:58.730 align:middle line:84%
into their homes and
into their wagons

00:26:58.730 --> 00:27:00.935 align:middle line:84%
or sew them into
their clothes to bring

00:27:00.935 --> 00:27:03.650 align:middle line:84%
the kind of good fortune
or the kind of protection

00:27:03.650 --> 00:27:05.460 align:middle line:90%
that they were looking for.

00:27:05.460 --> 00:27:08.270 align:middle line:84%
Compendium of magical
things is really a follow

00:27:08.270 --> 00:27:09.950 align:middle line:90%
on to my work with tarot.

00:27:09.950 --> 00:27:14.510 align:middle line:84%
It's to take all these different
languages of the divine, which

00:27:14.510 --> 00:27:19.100 align:middle line:84%
is what I call them, and
in a sort of a buffet style

00:27:19.100 --> 00:27:22.130 align:middle line:84%
take the fear out of it and
make them easy to understand.

00:27:22.130 --> 00:27:24.500 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So now how have
you done this with runes?

00:27:24.500 --> 00:27:25.875 align:middle line:84%
>>VALENTINE: So
one of the things

00:27:25.875 --> 00:27:32.000 align:middle line:84%
that I did was I did not go
too overly deep into Odin

00:27:32.000 --> 00:27:35.710 align:middle line:84%
and his gruesome way of
having come to the runes.

00:27:35.710 --> 00:27:37.060 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: This was darker times.

00:27:37.060 --> 00:27:38.420 align:middle line:84%
>>VALENTINE: Darker,
times hanging upside down,

00:27:38.420 --> 00:27:39.260 align:middle line:90%
bleeding out.

00:27:39.260 --> 00:27:40.550 align:middle line:90%
Fun, yeah, no.

00:27:40.550 --> 00:27:44.000 align:middle line:84%
So kind of like, eh, let's
not bring that up too much.

00:27:44.000 --> 00:27:47.300 align:middle line:84%
OK, Odin had a lot to do with
this, as an ancient Norse god,

00:27:47.300 --> 00:27:48.320 align:middle line:90%
so cool.

00:27:48.320 --> 00:27:50.930 align:middle line:10%
Writing Compendium was an
amazing experience for me,

00:27:50.930 --> 00:27:53.210 align:middle line:10%
because I started
to research runes.

00:27:53.210 --> 00:27:54.890 align:middle line:90%
And I started to play with them.

00:27:54.890 --> 00:27:57.120 align:middle line:90%
And they were blowing me away.

00:27:57.120 --> 00:27:58.890 align:middle line:84%
I mean, it's like I
would pull out a rune

00:27:58.890 --> 00:28:02.580 align:middle line:84%
and and then go read the message
for that rune and be like,

00:28:02.580 --> 00:28:04.010 align:middle line:90%
this is so spot on.

00:28:04.010 --> 00:28:05.930 align:middle line:90%
I can't believe it.

00:28:05.930 --> 00:28:07.665 align:middle line:90%
And the runes are stubborn.

00:28:07.665 --> 00:28:09.290 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: What do
you mean by stubborn?

00:28:09.290 --> 00:28:11.910 align:middle line:84%
>>VALENTINE: Well, so like
you'd throw it back in the bag.

00:28:11.910 --> 00:28:15.850 align:middle line:84%
And the next day you come and
you pull one and it's the same.

00:28:15.850 --> 00:28:16.650 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Same one?

00:28:16.650 --> 00:28:17.750 align:middle line:90%
Right.

00:28:17.750 --> 00:28:20.570 align:middle line:84%
>>VALENTINE: The runes,
they will task you.

00:28:20.570 --> 00:28:26.180 align:middle line:84%
They want you to take the
advice, do something with it.

00:28:26.180 --> 00:28:29.990 align:middle line:84%
And so, my experience with
them was either take the advice

00:28:29.990 --> 00:28:31.742 align:middle line:84%
and do something with
it, or they're just

00:28:31.742 --> 00:28:33.950 align:middle line:84%
going to hit you over and
over with the same message,

00:28:33.950 --> 00:28:35.990 align:middle line:84%
or they're going to
start goofing with you

00:28:35.990 --> 00:28:38.607 align:middle line:84%
and give you messages that
make no sense whatsoever.

00:28:38.607 --> 00:28:39.440 align:middle line:90%
It's just gibberish.

00:28:39.440 --> 00:28:41.920 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: If you ignore them,
then they'll play with you.

00:28:41.920 --> 00:28:42.370 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:28:42.370 --> 00:28:43.703 align:middle line:90%
>>VALENTINE: They'll ignore you.

00:28:43.703 --> 00:28:46.190 align:middle line:84%
It's like, you're not
taking me seriously.

00:28:46.190 --> 00:28:47.700 align:middle line:90%
But they're magical.

00:28:47.700 --> 00:28:49.310 align:middle line:90%
I love the way they feel.

00:28:49.310 --> 00:28:52.820 align:middle line:84%
In ancient times, people would
carve their own out of wood

00:28:52.820 --> 00:28:54.590 align:middle line:90%
or bone and paint their own.

00:28:54.590 --> 00:28:59.300 align:middle line:84%
But these days, they're cut into
crystals and all these kinds

00:28:59.300 --> 00:29:00.350 align:middle line:90%
of beautiful things.

00:29:00.350 --> 00:29:02.660 align:middle line:84%
I mean, they fit in
your purse, right?

00:29:02.660 --> 00:29:05.030 align:middle line:84%
You can take them
wherever you want to go.

00:29:05.030 --> 00:29:07.520 align:middle line:84%
You can very discreetly
reach into your purse

00:29:07.520 --> 00:29:08.418 align:middle line:90%
and pull a rune.

00:29:08.418 --> 00:29:10.460 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Pull a rune in
the middle of a business

00:29:10.460 --> 00:29:11.502 align:middle line:90%
meeting, a board meeting.

00:29:11.502 --> 00:29:13.140 align:middle line:90%
>>VALENTINE: Home Depot.

00:29:13.140 --> 00:29:14.390 align:middle line:90%
You know?

00:29:14.390 --> 00:29:17.510 align:middle line:90%
So they're very transportable.

00:29:17.510 --> 00:29:18.770 align:middle line:90%
And I love all that.

00:29:18.770 --> 00:29:19.910 align:middle line:90%
But they're deep.

00:29:19.910 --> 00:29:21.045 align:middle line:90%
I mean, this is not--

00:29:21.045 --> 00:29:23.420 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Are they I more of
a taskmaster, you're saying?

00:29:23.420 --> 00:29:27.020 align:middle line:84%
>>VALENTINE: They are a
taskmaster, but it's also deep.

00:29:27.020 --> 00:29:29.480 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So let's talk
about the depth or nature

00:29:29.480 --> 00:29:32.970 align:middle line:84%
of those messages, say, as
opposed to tarot, for example.

00:29:32.970 --> 00:29:33.770 align:middle line:90%
>>VALENTINE: Sure.

00:29:33.770 --> 00:29:36.920 align:middle line:84%
Well, both of those
things have a tendency

00:29:36.920 --> 00:29:39.290 align:middle line:90%
to tap into the subconscious.

00:29:39.290 --> 00:29:44.810 align:middle line:84%
It just feels like with tarot
do a Celtic cross with 10 cards,

00:29:44.810 --> 00:29:48.050 align:middle line:84%
and you're going to mimic the
depth of any other language

00:29:48.050 --> 00:29:49.070 align:middle line:90%
of the divine.

00:29:49.070 --> 00:29:53.570 align:middle line:84%
But from a standpoint of here's
one card of tarot and one rune,

00:29:53.570 --> 00:29:55.520 align:middle line:84%
the depth of the
message from the rune

00:29:55.520 --> 00:29:59.480 align:middle line:84%
is going to be more significant
than the depth of the one card.

00:29:59.480 --> 00:30:00.980 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So just
by way of example,

00:30:00.980 --> 00:30:02.540 align:middle line:84%
tell us what that
might look like.

00:30:02.540 --> 00:30:05.360 align:middle line:84%
>>VALENTINE: Well, the rune
that I kept pulling was Perth.

00:30:05.360 --> 00:30:07.670 align:middle line:84%
And Perth is a
card that literally

00:30:07.670 --> 00:30:11.300 align:middle line:84%
talks about the need
for you to go deeper,

00:30:11.300 --> 00:30:17.820 align:middle line:84%
for you to go within and find
out exactly what is happening

00:30:17.820 --> 00:30:22.500 align:middle line:84%
within you and to understand
how that is fitting into what

00:30:22.500 --> 00:30:25.330 align:middle line:84%
you're doing at the moment now
that made a lot of sense to me.

00:30:25.330 --> 00:30:27.330 align:middle line:84%
I was writing "Compendium
of Magical Things."

00:30:27.330 --> 00:30:32.310 align:middle line:84%
And so, it was literally about,
Radleigh, come on step it up.

00:30:32.310 --> 00:30:33.980 align:middle line:90%
Step up your game.

00:30:33.980 --> 00:30:35.770 align:middle line:90%
Where are you going?

00:30:35.770 --> 00:30:38.080 align:middle line:84%
And what are you
going to do with this?

00:30:38.080 --> 00:30:40.620 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So with that, as
I was talking about earlier,

00:30:40.620 --> 00:30:42.330 align:middle line:84%
oftentimes, people
think, well, I

00:30:42.330 --> 00:30:45.160 align:middle line:84%
need to have some kind
of bead on this game

00:30:45.160 --> 00:30:47.330 align:middle line:84%
so I know how to interpret
what I'm seeing and all.

00:30:47.330 --> 00:30:49.710 align:middle line:90%
Do runes require interpretation?

00:30:49.710 --> 00:30:53.008 align:middle line:84%
Or are they very much
more direct messages?

00:30:53.008 --> 00:30:55.050 align:middle line:84%
>>VALENTINE: I think every
language of the divine

00:30:55.050 --> 00:30:56.820 align:middle line:90%
is interpretation.

00:30:56.820 --> 00:30:57.910 align:middle line:90%
I just do.

00:30:57.910 --> 00:31:02.100 align:middle line:84%
And I think that,
initially, I think

00:31:02.100 --> 00:31:04.680 align:middle line:84%
it's initially fine
to just go directly

00:31:04.680 --> 00:31:09.270 align:middle line:84%
to the specific message,
because you're learning.

00:31:09.270 --> 00:31:12.480 align:middle line:84%
And the thing,
Regina, is that we

00:31:12.480 --> 00:31:16.770 align:middle line:84%
have a tendency to want
to say, that's the magic.

00:31:16.770 --> 00:31:17.940 align:middle line:90%
The magic is the runes.

00:31:17.940 --> 00:31:18.960 align:middle line:90%
The magic is the cards.

00:31:18.960 --> 00:31:21.700 align:middle line:84%
The magic is the I
Ching or the pendulum.

00:31:21.700 --> 00:31:22.500 align:middle line:90%
We are the magic.

00:31:22.500 --> 00:31:23.430 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Absolutely.

00:31:23.430 --> 00:31:26.820 align:middle line:84%
>>VALENTINE: And I let my
students go there for a while,

00:31:26.820 --> 00:31:30.370 align:middle line:84%
because it gives
them confidence.

00:31:30.370 --> 00:31:33.120 align:middle line:84%
And if I push it back
on them too fast,

00:31:33.120 --> 00:31:35.920 align:middle line:84%
then they're going to go to
a lack of self-confidence.

00:31:35.920 --> 00:31:36.720 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:31:36.720 --> 00:31:37.460 align:middle line:90%
And that's important.

00:31:37.460 --> 00:31:38.200 align:middle line:84%
>>VALENTINE: And
not be empowered.

00:31:38.200 --> 00:31:39.790 align:middle line:90%
So I let them go there.

00:31:39.790 --> 00:31:43.500 align:middle line:84%
But as we go through this,
I bring it back to them.

00:31:43.500 --> 00:31:46.530 align:middle line:84%
Like this class
I just taught was

00:31:46.530 --> 00:31:48.540 align:middle line:84%
the last thing I
made them do was

00:31:48.540 --> 00:31:51.662 align:middle line:84%
they had to do a reading
with no cards, no pendulums.

00:31:51.662 --> 00:31:52.620 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Good for you.

00:31:52.620 --> 00:31:53.620 align:middle line:90%
>>VALENTINE: No nothing.

00:31:53.620 --> 00:31:54.510 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:31:54.510 --> 00:31:55.760 align:middle line:90%
>>VALENTINE: It was just them.

00:31:55.760 --> 00:31:57.315 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: You are
the tuning device.

00:31:57.315 --> 00:31:59.315 align:middle line:84%
>>VALENTINE: And that was
the last thing we did.

00:31:59.315 --> 00:32:01.230 align:middle line:84%
And they blew it
out of the water.

00:32:01.230 --> 00:32:05.710 align:middle line:84%
So that they could see
it's the divine within you.

00:32:05.710 --> 00:32:07.260 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: That's wonderful.

00:32:07.260 --> 00:32:10.560 align:middle line:84%
I think that's a wonderful
way to cap that really.

00:32:10.560 --> 00:32:12.210 align:middle line:84%
Because in the
end, it is all us.

00:32:12.210 --> 00:32:13.670 align:middle line:90%
>>VALENTINE: It is.

00:32:13.670 --> 00:32:14.550 align:middle line:90%
We are the magic.

00:32:14.550 --> 00:32:15.420 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:32:15.420 --> 00:32:18.160 align:middle line:84%
Sometimes if we need a
little external reflection,

00:32:18.160 --> 00:32:19.410 align:middle line:90%
these are wonderful tools.

00:32:19.410 --> 00:32:20.368 align:middle line:90%
>>VALENTINE: Excellent.

00:32:20.368 --> 00:32:23.460 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So this is one
that's little-known--

00:32:23.460 --> 00:32:25.710 align:middle line:84%
not so well-known in
the United States.

00:32:25.710 --> 00:32:26.640 align:middle line:90%
Then Lenormand.

00:32:26.640 --> 00:32:27.300 align:middle line:90%
>>VALENTINE: The Lenormand.

00:32:27.300 --> 00:32:27.960 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Lenormand.

00:32:27.960 --> 00:32:29.730 align:middle line:84%
And I was going to do an
interview a couple of years

00:32:29.730 --> 00:32:32.400 align:middle line:84%
ago on it in England and it
fell apart for some reason.

00:32:32.400 --> 00:32:34.710 align:middle line:84%
So please-- so I
didn't delve into it.

00:32:34.710 --> 00:32:36.870 align:middle line:10%
So what is Lenormand?

00:32:36.870 --> 00:32:38.790 align:middle line:10%
>>VALENTINE: It's 36 cards.

00:32:38.790 --> 00:32:40.920 align:middle line:10%
There are people who
adore the Lenormand,

00:32:40.920 --> 00:32:44.700 align:middle line:10%
and angels bless them.

00:32:44.700 --> 00:32:46.590 align:middle line:90%
It didn't resonate for me.

00:32:46.590 --> 00:32:48.960 align:middle line:84%
Not everything
resonates for everybody.

00:32:48.960 --> 00:32:50.670 align:middle line:84%
And the reason it
didn't resonate for me

00:32:50.670 --> 00:32:54.330 align:middle line:84%
is that people who
practice Lenormand say it's

00:32:54.330 --> 00:32:56.920 align:middle line:90%
easier than the other options.

00:32:56.920 --> 00:33:01.240 align:middle line:90%
I find it way more complex.

00:33:01.240 --> 00:33:04.290 align:middle line:84%
It actually came into
being because there

00:33:04.290 --> 00:33:07.170 align:middle line:84%
was a woman whose
name was Lenormand

00:33:07.170 --> 00:33:11.280 align:middle line:84%
who was a very famous
fortune teller, had

00:33:11.280 --> 00:33:14.180 align:middle line:90%
Marie Antoinette as a client.

00:33:14.180 --> 00:33:16.200 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: As most royalty do.

00:33:16.200 --> 00:33:19.920 align:middle line:84%
I mean, just as you had the
druids throughout the royalty

00:33:19.920 --> 00:33:21.550 align:middle line:90%
of Britain.

00:33:21.550 --> 00:33:23.880 align:middle line:84%
They always had their
druid by their side.

00:33:23.880 --> 00:33:27.210 align:middle line:84%
I mean, having
wise people, seers,

00:33:27.210 --> 00:33:29.580 align:middle line:84%
those who can read
cards, has always

00:33:29.580 --> 00:33:32.810 align:middle line:84%
been side-by-side, it seems,
with the royal traditions.

00:33:32.810 --> 00:33:33.810 align:middle line:90%
>>VALENTINE: Absolutely.

00:33:33.810 --> 00:33:34.350 align:middle line:90%
Absolutely.

00:33:34.350 --> 00:33:35.150 align:middle line:90%
That's true.

00:33:35.150 --> 00:33:38.160 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: To foresee what your
next move is strategically.

00:33:38.160 --> 00:33:40.410 align:middle line:84%
You're in war, or whose land
you're going to take or--

00:33:40.410 --> 00:33:40.950 align:middle line:84%
>>VALENTINE: Who am
I going to marry?

00:33:40.950 --> 00:33:41.736 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: --who's
going to take yours.

00:33:41.736 --> 00:33:42.570 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:33:42.570 --> 00:33:43.740 align:middle line:90%
>>VALENTINE: Right.

00:33:43.740 --> 00:33:46.230 align:middle line:84%
Well, nevertheless,
she was very famous,

00:33:46.230 --> 00:33:47.430 align:middle line:90%
and she was very well-known.

00:33:47.430 --> 00:33:50.040 align:middle line:90%
And she passed over.

00:33:50.040 --> 00:33:53.490 align:middle line:84%
And so a lot of
different companies

00:33:53.490 --> 00:33:59.670 align:middle line:84%
that made cards said, oh,
here's Madame Lenormand's cards.

00:33:59.670 --> 00:34:01.290 align:middle line:90%
We've recreated them.

00:34:01.290 --> 00:34:03.570 align:middle line:90%
Well, that was a lie, OK?

00:34:03.570 --> 00:34:04.410 align:middle line:90%
They weren't.

00:34:04.410 --> 00:34:06.930 align:middle line:84%
She actually did something
called cartomancy, which

00:34:06.930 --> 00:34:09.389 align:middle line:90%
is reading with playing cards.

00:34:09.389 --> 00:34:10.570 align:middle line:90%
So they were not hers.

00:34:10.570 --> 00:34:11.370 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Oh, yeah.

00:34:11.370 --> 00:34:13.610 align:middle line:84%
And that went on to
become its own thing, too.

00:34:13.610 --> 00:34:14.020 align:middle line:90%
>>VALENTINE: And it is.

00:34:14.020 --> 00:34:14.340 align:middle line:90%
Still is.

00:34:14.340 --> 00:34:14.639 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:34:14.639 --> 00:34:14.980 align:middle line:90%
It is.

00:34:14.980 --> 00:34:15.540 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:34:15.540 --> 00:34:17.190 align:middle line:84%
>>VALENTINE: And
so these companies

00:34:17.190 --> 00:34:20.560 align:middle line:84%
started trying to
capitalize on her passing.

00:34:20.560 --> 00:34:23.489 align:middle line:84%
And so they came out
with the Lenormand.

00:34:23.489 --> 00:34:26.100 align:middle line:84%
And the Lenormand,
they're very simple cards.

00:34:26.100 --> 00:34:30.190 align:middle line:84%
They're cards like the
key, and the fox, the book.

00:34:30.190 --> 00:34:33.900 align:middle line:84%
Each one of these cards has
a lot of different meanings.

00:34:33.900 --> 00:34:38.280 align:middle line:84%
And unfortunately, some of those
meanings all seem to relate,

00:34:38.280 --> 00:34:43.749 align:middle line:84%
and then it'll just out
of nowhere throw in a M

00:34:43.749 --> 00:34:46.219 align:middle line:84%
And you're like, where
did that come from?

00:34:46.219 --> 00:34:49.080 align:middle line:84%
It's like the star,
it's dreams coming true

00:34:49.080 --> 00:34:51.190 align:middle line:84%
and all these things
all seem to make sense.

00:34:51.190 --> 00:34:53.460 align:middle line:84%
And then it also
means electricity.

00:34:53.460 --> 00:34:56.070 align:middle line:90%
And I'm like, uh, what?

00:34:56.070 --> 00:34:58.140 align:middle line:84%
The most famous way
of reading Lenormands

00:34:58.140 --> 00:34:59.417 align:middle line:90%
is to use all 36 cards.

00:34:59.417 --> 00:35:00.875 align:middle line:84%
>>VALENTINE: So
I'm think, intense.

00:35:00.875 --> 00:35:01.580 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Wow, that's too much.

00:35:01.580 --> 00:35:01.950 align:middle line:90%
Too much information.

00:35:01.950 --> 00:35:03.080 align:middle line:90%
>>VALENTINE: That's intense.

00:35:03.080 --> 00:35:03.330 align:middle line:90%
Intense.

00:35:03.330 --> 00:35:04.290 align:middle line:90%
It's a lot.

00:35:04.290 --> 00:35:07.530 align:middle line:84%
And much like astrology,
which has houses--

00:35:07.530 --> 00:35:11.340 align:middle line:84%
so the where the planets land
means something different

00:35:11.340 --> 00:35:13.500 align:middle line:90%
based on which house it is in--

00:35:13.500 --> 00:35:19.740 align:middle line:84%
the Lenormand, the Grand
Tableau, where each card landed

00:35:19.740 --> 00:35:21.140 align:middle line:90%
changes its meaning.

00:35:21.140 --> 00:35:21.940 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: OK.

00:35:21.940 --> 00:35:22.200 align:middle line:90%
All right.

00:35:22.200 --> 00:35:23.158 align:middle line:90%
>>VALENTINE: So, right?

00:35:23.158 --> 00:35:24.020 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: I'm tired.

00:35:24.020 --> 00:35:24.750 align:middle line:90%
>>VALENTINE: I have a headache.

00:35:24.750 --> 00:35:24.840 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:35:24.840 --> 00:35:25.640 align:middle line:90%
I'm tired.

00:35:25.640 --> 00:35:26.820 align:middle line:90%
Let's move on, OK?

00:35:26.820 --> 00:35:30.138 align:middle line:90%
Thank you for sharing.

00:35:30.138 --> 00:35:31.680 align:middle line:84%
You touched on
something a moment ago

00:35:31.680 --> 00:35:36.060 align:middle line:84%
that I actually really enjoy,
which is the whole destiny

00:35:36.060 --> 00:35:37.230 align:middle line:90%
card, love card thing--

00:35:37.230 --> 00:35:40.830 align:middle line:84%
still based on the playing deck
and the interpretations there.

00:35:40.830 --> 00:35:43.050 align:middle line:84%
And I find those
kind of fun when

00:35:43.050 --> 00:35:45.540 align:middle line:84%
you look at the back and
their little compatibility

00:35:45.540 --> 00:35:47.340 align:middle line:90%
charts and such.

00:35:47.340 --> 00:35:48.510 align:middle line:90%
And so through the years--

00:35:48.510 --> 00:35:50.760 align:middle line:84%
I have a cousin who was
really into all of that.

00:35:50.760 --> 00:35:53.390 align:middle line:84%
And so she'd bring it around,
talking about this and that,

00:35:53.390 --> 00:35:55.590 align:middle line:84%
and I'd pay attention
here and there.

00:35:55.590 --> 00:35:57.870 align:middle line:84%
And I found that that
part of it actually

00:35:57.870 --> 00:36:01.380 align:middle line:84%
seemed to have some real truth
coming out of it in terms

00:36:01.380 --> 00:36:04.770 align:middle line:84%
of the compatibility, via
the numbers and the suits,

00:36:04.770 --> 00:36:07.040 align:middle line:90%
of you and another human being.

00:36:07.040 --> 00:36:07.840 align:middle line:90%
So I don't know.

00:36:07.840 --> 00:36:11.460 align:middle line:84%
What is your experience
with destiny cards?

00:36:11.460 --> 00:36:14.350 align:middle line:84%
>>VALENTINE: I haven't worked
with them all that much.

00:36:14.350 --> 00:36:18.100 align:middle line:84%
I do find that just like
any language of the divine,

00:36:18.100 --> 00:36:18.900 align:middle line:90%
it's the faith.

00:36:18.900 --> 00:36:24.600 align:middle line:84%
And so if that is what draws
you and you believe in it

00:36:24.600 --> 00:36:25.898 align:middle line:90%
and you trust it--

00:36:25.898 --> 00:36:27.690 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: It really
does come down to that.

00:36:27.690 --> 00:36:28.870 align:middle line:84%
>>VALENTINE: It does
come down to that.

00:36:28.870 --> 00:36:31.200 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Because you're
the information source.

00:36:31.200 --> 00:36:33.030 align:middle line:84%
>>VALENTINE: People
ask me why this works.

00:36:33.030 --> 00:36:34.613 align:middle line:84%
Well, there's the
spark of the divine,

00:36:34.613 --> 00:36:37.380 align:middle line:84%
but also, the I Ching is
thousands of years old--

00:36:37.380 --> 00:36:38.250 align:middle line:90%
thousands.

00:36:38.250 --> 00:36:41.370 align:middle line:84%
And so that means,
think of this as,

00:36:41.370 --> 00:36:43.980 align:middle line:84%
from a spiritual, metaphysical
standpoint, people

00:36:43.980 --> 00:36:46.500 align:middle line:90%
walking through a garden.

00:36:46.500 --> 00:36:49.200 align:middle line:84%
Over the years,
they have learned--

00:36:49.200 --> 00:36:51.660 align:middle line:84%
people have come
together and learned,

00:36:51.660 --> 00:36:54.330 align:middle line:84%
this is the best way to
go through this garden.

00:36:54.330 --> 00:36:55.530 align:middle line:90%
It's the most scenic.

00:36:55.530 --> 00:36:56.640 align:middle line:90%
It's the most lovely.

00:36:56.640 --> 00:36:58.320 align:middle line:90%
It's the most heartwarming.

00:36:58.320 --> 00:37:00.330 align:middle line:84%
Maybe it's the
shortest distance.

00:37:00.330 --> 00:37:02.220 align:middle line:90%
And we've worn a path.

00:37:02.220 --> 00:37:05.490 align:middle line:84%
So from a spiritual standpoint,
these languages of the divine

00:37:05.490 --> 00:37:10.730 align:middle line:84%
have worn a path
between us and source.

00:37:10.730 --> 00:37:13.070 align:middle line:84%
Because all of these
people-- millions

00:37:13.070 --> 00:37:15.850 align:middle line:84%
and millions and millions of
people have lent their faith.

00:37:15.850 --> 00:37:17.850 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Yeah, it creates
a field of resonance.

00:37:17.850 --> 00:37:18.300 align:middle line:90%
>>VALENTINE: It does.

00:37:18.300 --> 00:37:18.950 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:37:18.950 --> 00:37:19.750 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:37:19.750 --> 00:37:22.240 align:middle line:84%
So yeah, I mean, it's just
another one-- love cards,

00:37:22.240 --> 00:37:23.480 align:middle line:90%
destiny cards.

00:37:23.480 --> 00:37:27.150 align:middle line:84%
That's a quick and easy-- it's
the opposite of the Lenormand.

00:37:27.150 --> 00:37:27.950 align:middle line:90%
OK?

00:37:27.950 --> 00:37:28.250 align:middle line:90%
You just look it up--

00:37:28.250 --> 00:37:28.750 align:middle line:90%
>>VALENTINE: The anti-Lenormand.

00:37:28.750 --> 00:37:29.917 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: --and you're done.

00:37:29.917 --> 00:37:31.235 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:37:31.235 --> 00:37:32.930 align:middle line:90%
If you're not a patient person.

00:37:32.930 --> 00:37:35.930 align:middle line:84%
One thing I want to
talk about is names.

00:37:35.930 --> 00:37:38.700 align:middle line:84%
Because we choose our
names before birth.

00:37:38.700 --> 00:37:39.500 align:middle line:90%
>>VALENTINE: Yes.

00:37:39.500 --> 00:37:42.350 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: I love that subject
because I have, in the past,

00:37:42.350 --> 00:37:45.470 align:middle line:84%
if it's someone very, very
close to me, or as a favor,

00:37:45.470 --> 00:37:48.060 align:middle line:84%
I'll do baby readings in the
week before a baby's born.

00:37:48.060 --> 00:37:50.270 align:middle line:84%
And get information from
them, and they'll talk to me

00:37:50.270 --> 00:37:51.830 align:middle line:90%
about names and other things.

00:37:51.830 --> 00:37:53.600 align:middle line:84%
But you're on the
same page here,

00:37:53.600 --> 00:37:55.160 align:middle line:90%
that we choose our parents.

00:37:55.160 --> 00:37:56.810 align:middle line:90%
We choose our name.

00:37:56.810 --> 00:37:59.850 align:middle line:84%
And I think this is important
information to know.

00:37:59.850 --> 00:38:02.810 align:middle line:84%
So first of all, yours
is not your Sedona name.

00:38:02.810 --> 00:38:04.242 align:middle line:90%
You are Radleigh Valentine.

00:38:04.242 --> 00:38:05.950 align:middle line:84%
>>VALENTINE: And it's
not my Sedona name.

00:38:05.950 --> 00:38:06.670 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: I love it.

00:38:06.670 --> 00:38:06.770 align:middle line:90%
I've only known--

00:38:06.770 --> 00:38:08.100 align:middle line:84%
>>VALENTINE: No, I really
am Radleigh Valentine.

00:38:08.100 --> 00:38:10.058 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: --one other
person with the last name

00:38:10.058 --> 00:38:12.230 align:middle line:84%
of Valentine, which I
thought was a fortunate name.

00:38:12.230 --> 00:38:17.930 align:middle line:84%
So let's talk about how a
being inspires their parents

00:38:17.930 --> 00:38:21.380 align:middle line:84%
to embrace and then put
on a birth certificate

00:38:21.380 --> 00:38:23.510 align:middle line:90%
a name that they want as a soul.

00:38:23.510 --> 00:38:24.470 align:middle line:90%
>>VALENTINE: Right.

00:38:24.470 --> 00:38:28.388 align:middle line:84%
Well, so I believe that,
when we are on the other--

00:38:28.388 --> 00:38:30.680 align:middle line:84%
well, I have all kinds of
beliefs about the other side.

00:38:30.680 --> 00:38:32.055 align:middle line:84%
But when we're on
the other side,

00:38:32.055 --> 00:38:33.680 align:middle line:84%
one of the things
that we want to do

00:38:33.680 --> 00:38:37.400 align:middle line:84%
is to be in an
energetic alignment.

00:38:37.400 --> 00:38:39.360 align:middle line:90%
We want to set the stage.

00:38:39.360 --> 00:38:44.720 align:middle line:84%
We don't want to come to
Earth with an operating

00:38:44.720 --> 00:38:48.260 align:middle line:84%
system of Windows 7
when, really, Windows 10

00:38:48.260 --> 00:38:49.230 align:middle line:90%
is the way to go.

00:38:49.230 --> 00:38:50.030 align:middle line:90%
All right?

00:38:50.030 --> 00:38:53.520 align:middle line:84%
So this is almost like
our operating system.

00:38:53.520 --> 00:38:57.450 align:middle line:84%
So we're choosing our
time and place of birth

00:38:57.450 --> 00:39:00.140 align:middle line:90%
so that the astrology is right.

00:39:00.140 --> 00:39:03.950 align:middle line:84%
We're choosing our name so
that the numerology is right.

00:39:03.950 --> 00:39:07.760 align:middle line:84%
These things having
energetic effects upon us,

00:39:07.760 --> 00:39:12.250 align:middle line:84%
and the way we move through
the metaphorical video

00:39:12.250 --> 00:39:14.113 align:middle line:90%
game that is life.

00:39:14.113 --> 00:39:15.530 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So how
does this happen?

00:39:15.530 --> 00:39:17.720 align:middle line:84%
Tell people, on a
social level, how

00:39:17.720 --> 00:39:20.282 align:middle line:84%
do you get that name, as
a soul about to incarnate,

00:39:20.282 --> 00:39:21.990 align:middle line:84%
to your parents if
they haven't already--

00:39:21.990 --> 00:39:22.625 align:middle line:90%
>>VALENTINE: Oh, to the parents.

00:39:22.625 --> 00:39:24.260 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: --a close attachment
to a name that they're

00:39:24.260 --> 00:39:25.552 align:middle line:90%
going to choose no matter what.

00:39:25.552 --> 00:39:27.980 align:middle line:84%
>>VALENTINE: I think angels
are whispering in their ears.

00:39:27.980 --> 00:39:30.920 align:middle line:84%
I mean, my sister,
when she was getting

00:39:30.920 --> 00:39:33.650 align:middle line:84%
ready to give birth to
my nephew, had decided,

00:39:33.650 --> 00:39:35.720 align:middle line:90%
his name is Kolton.

00:39:35.720 --> 00:39:37.532 align:middle line:90%
I mean, we're done.

00:39:37.532 --> 00:39:38.990 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: We are
not up for debate.

00:39:38.990 --> 00:39:40.532 align:middle line:84%
>>VALENTINE: We're
not up for debate.

00:39:40.532 --> 00:39:41.650 align:middle line:90%
His name is Kolton.

00:39:41.650 --> 00:39:45.260 align:middle line:90%
We're starting to monogram crap.

00:39:45.260 --> 00:39:48.820 align:middle line:84%
And she comes out of childbirth
and says, here's Thaniel.

00:39:48.820 --> 00:39:49.620 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:39:49.620 --> 00:39:50.420 align:middle line:90%
>>VALENTINE: Right?

00:39:50.420 --> 00:39:51.770 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: And this does happen.

00:39:51.770 --> 00:39:52.943 align:middle line:90%
It happens a lot.

00:39:52.943 --> 00:39:54.360 align:middle line:84%
>>VALENTINE: It
does happen a lot.

00:39:54.360 --> 00:39:55.420 align:middle line:90%
And I think that's--

00:39:55.420 --> 00:39:57.830 align:middle line:84%
you know, the Kolton
was a beautiful name.

00:39:57.830 --> 00:40:02.120 align:middle line:84%
It matched Kristen and Kira,
we have all the K's, they all

00:40:02.120 --> 00:40:04.250 align:middle line:90%
have the same initials.

00:40:04.250 --> 00:40:06.680 align:middle line:84%
And then suddenly this
monkey wrench gets thrown in.

00:40:06.680 --> 00:40:09.680 align:middle line:84%
Because I think that, sometimes,
parents can be in this place

00:40:09.680 --> 00:40:12.420 align:middle line:84%
where, we're naming this
person after my father,

00:40:12.420 --> 00:40:14.360 align:middle line:84%
or we're naming this
person blah-blah-blah.

00:40:14.360 --> 00:40:20.430 align:middle line:84%
And then in the magic
of the moment of birth,

00:40:20.430 --> 00:40:21.430 align:middle line:90%
it all changes.

00:40:21.430 --> 00:40:22.230 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: It does.

00:40:22.230 --> 00:40:24.930 align:middle line:84%
And somehow, that
intuitive impulse,

00:40:24.930 --> 00:40:28.020 align:middle line:84%
and the rush of everything
around the birth, the magic

00:40:28.020 --> 00:40:29.790 align:middle line:84%
of the birth
experience, it seems

00:40:29.790 --> 00:40:31.230 align:middle line:90%
to be able to make it through.

00:40:31.230 --> 00:40:32.550 align:middle line:84%
>>VALENTINE: It does
make it through.

00:40:32.550 --> 00:40:33.270 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Which is fascinating.

00:40:33.270 --> 00:40:35.730 align:middle line:84%
>>VALENTINE: Well, it makes
it through the mom, for sure.

00:40:35.730 --> 00:40:38.760 align:middle line:84%
And the dad, if
it's a good father,

00:40:38.760 --> 00:40:42.390 align:middle line:84%
he's just as
enchanted by the gift

00:40:42.390 --> 00:40:44.280 align:middle line:90%
that has just been given him.

00:40:44.280 --> 00:40:48.652 align:middle line:84%
So they're both in this
open-hearted place.

00:40:48.652 --> 00:40:49.860 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: And that's the key.

00:40:49.860 --> 00:40:51.080 align:middle line:90%
They're open.

00:40:51.080 --> 00:40:54.360 align:middle line:84%
Now, there are people who
are going to incarnate,

00:40:54.360 --> 00:40:58.970 align:middle line:84%
and they are going to be John
Turner III and John Turner IV.

00:40:58.970 --> 00:41:02.430 align:middle line:84%
But that person has
chosen to somehow embody

00:41:02.430 --> 00:41:06.760 align:middle line:84%
that information stream, that
frequency, that resonance.

00:41:06.760 --> 00:41:09.070 align:middle line:84%
So they're choosing a
continuation of that.

00:41:09.070 --> 00:41:10.320 align:middle line:90%
>>VALENTINE: And that lineage.

00:41:10.320 --> 00:41:12.210 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And that
lineage, exactly.

00:41:12.210 --> 00:41:12.530 align:middle line:90%
Exactly.

00:41:12.530 --> 00:41:13.410 align:middle line:90%
>>VALENTINE: Yes.

00:41:13.410 --> 00:41:15.750 align:middle line:84%
I think that, when
that happens, it's

00:41:15.750 --> 00:41:18.073 align:middle line:84%
someone who is
continuing the work.

00:41:18.073 --> 00:41:20.490 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And they could have
already been in-- maybe they

00:41:20.490 --> 00:41:21.300 align:middle line:90%
were the first.

00:41:21.300 --> 00:41:21.970 align:middle line:90%
>>VALENTINE: Could have been.

00:41:21.970 --> 00:41:23.762 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And maybe
even reincarnating back

00:41:23.762 --> 00:41:25.250 align:middle line:90%
into a family to continue on--

00:41:25.250 --> 00:41:25.470 align:middle line:90%
>>VALENTINE: Absolutely.

00:41:25.470 --> 00:41:26.520 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: --the same lineage.

00:41:26.520 --> 00:41:28.228 align:middle line:84%
>>VALENTINE: They're
continuing the work.

00:41:28.228 --> 00:41:31.020 align:middle line:84%
Because we also travel
in these soul families.

00:41:31.020 --> 00:41:32.880 align:middle line:90%
We travel in soul families.

00:41:32.880 --> 00:41:34.980 align:middle line:84%
It's like, I love my
husband, he's fantastic,

00:41:34.980 --> 00:41:39.060 align:middle line:90%
but he might have been my dad.

00:41:39.060 --> 00:41:40.950 align:middle line:90%
That's scary.

00:41:40.950 --> 00:41:42.810 align:middle line:84%
Might have been my dad
three lifetimes ago.

00:41:42.810 --> 00:41:43.610 align:middle line:90%
Who knows.

00:41:43.610 --> 00:41:44.820 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: No, and it's true.

00:41:44.820 --> 00:41:46.988 align:middle line:84%
We're all in that kind
of cosmic soup together.

00:41:46.988 --> 00:41:48.030 align:middle line:90%
>>VALENTINE: Yes, we are.

00:41:48.030 --> 00:41:49.947 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So I have a
little story about that.

00:41:49.947 --> 00:41:52.650 align:middle line:84%
So this was before one
of my nieces was born.

00:41:52.650 --> 00:41:55.740 align:middle line:84%
And my sister said, hey, could
you do a little baby reading?

00:41:55.740 --> 00:41:58.380 align:middle line:84%
And I did, and some
wonderful things showed up.

00:41:58.380 --> 00:42:01.200 align:middle line:84%
I saw as a little girl
wandering behind her dad

00:42:01.200 --> 00:42:03.330 align:middle line:84%
through the garden, and
her passion was flowers.

00:42:03.330 --> 00:42:04.530 align:middle line:90%
Well, she's all grown up.

00:42:04.530 --> 00:42:05.330 align:middle line:90%
She's 30.

00:42:05.330 --> 00:42:06.850 align:middle line:90%
She's a floral designer now.

00:42:06.850 --> 00:42:08.920 align:middle line:90%
You know, that kind of thing.

00:42:08.920 --> 00:42:12.120 align:middle line:84%
But in amidst it, she
said her name was Alex.

00:42:12.120 --> 00:42:15.355 align:middle line:84%
And I didn't even know for
sure if it was a boy or girl.

00:42:15.355 --> 00:42:17.730 align:middle line:84%
I was kind of just dialing
into where they were wandering

00:42:17.730 --> 00:42:19.980 align:middle line:84%
and what they were doing,
because the sex hadn't

00:42:19.980 --> 00:42:22.042 align:middle line:90%
been known at that time.

00:42:22.042 --> 00:42:24.000 align:middle line:84%
And so I can't remember
if I knew it was a girl

00:42:24.000 --> 00:42:25.542 align:middle line:84%
or didn't, but I
thought the name was

00:42:25.542 --> 00:42:27.330 align:middle line:90%
Alexander or Alexandra, period.

00:42:27.330 --> 00:42:28.150 align:middle line:90%
Right?

00:42:28.150 --> 00:42:31.810 align:middle line:84%
And so I thought, oh, my god,
they came through so strongly.

00:42:31.810 --> 00:42:34.770 align:middle line:84%
I hope my sister hasn't
chosen a name already.

00:42:34.770 --> 00:42:37.050 align:middle line:90%
I just-- I hate to interfere.

00:42:37.050 --> 00:42:38.860 align:middle line:90%
It's a delicate process.

00:42:38.860 --> 00:42:40.890 align:middle line:84%
Especially when you--
it is a magical thing.

00:42:40.890 --> 00:42:43.450 align:middle line:84%
The mother and father should
be given that information.

00:42:43.450 --> 00:42:46.890 align:middle line:84%
So I said, Denise,
have you determined

00:42:46.890 --> 00:42:48.310 align:middle line:90%
a name yet for the baby?

00:42:48.310 --> 00:42:49.560 align:middle line:90%
And she said, oh yeah.

00:42:49.560 --> 00:42:53.550 align:middle line:84%
Just last night, we decided
it's Alexander or Alexandra.

00:42:53.550 --> 00:42:56.760 align:middle line:84%
So the same night, that entity
came through to both of us,

00:42:56.760 --> 00:42:58.920 align:middle line:90%
and that's the name I want.

00:42:58.920 --> 00:43:01.380 align:middle line:84%
Interestingly, she
changed her name

00:43:01.380 --> 00:43:04.170 align:middle line:84%
to her nickname of
Allie that doesn't

00:43:04.170 --> 00:43:06.450 align:middle line:84%
have the power and presence
of the vibration she

00:43:06.450 --> 00:43:08.340 align:middle line:90%
chose as an adult.

00:43:08.340 --> 00:43:12.540 align:middle line:84%
>>VALENTINE: And yet it
may be a situation where--

00:43:12.540 --> 00:43:14.750 align:middle line:84%
because people do
change their names.

00:43:14.750 --> 00:43:17.160 align:middle line:84%
And the vibration
of the birth name

00:43:17.160 --> 00:43:18.660 align:middle line:90%
always stays in the background.

00:43:18.660 --> 00:43:22.590 align:middle line:84%
But you can add onto
that energy and vibration

00:43:22.590 --> 00:43:24.420 align:middle line:90%
by making adjustments.

00:43:24.420 --> 00:43:27.360 align:middle line:84%
And just recently,
the woman that

00:43:27.360 --> 00:43:32.640 align:middle line:84%
is the "manager of
miracles" of my company

00:43:32.640 --> 00:43:36.390 align:middle line:84%
was told she should
change her last name,

00:43:36.390 --> 00:43:41.100 align:middle line:84%
and to get rid of
her married name

00:43:41.100 --> 00:43:44.053 align:middle line:84%
and to switch back
to her maiden name.

00:43:44.053 --> 00:43:45.220 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: This is important.

00:43:45.220 --> 00:43:46.920 align:middle line:84%
Now, this is something,
with the beings

00:43:46.920 --> 00:43:50.970 align:middle line:84%
that I've been
incarnating with forever,

00:43:50.970 --> 00:43:52.950 align:middle line:84%
and that serve as
guides, they've

00:43:52.950 --> 00:43:54.330 align:middle line:84%
often talked about
the importance

00:43:54.330 --> 00:43:56.040 align:middle line:90%
of that vibration of the name.

00:43:56.040 --> 00:43:58.700 align:middle line:84%
And oftentimes, we'll
come into an incarnation

00:43:58.700 --> 00:44:02.280 align:middle line:84%
with an energy we're
carrying forward from before.

00:44:02.280 --> 00:44:04.630 align:middle line:90%
And so it's a familiar energy.

00:44:04.630 --> 00:44:06.600 align:middle line:84%
So we're going to use
that name to begin,

00:44:06.600 --> 00:44:09.762 align:middle line:84%
but then you start growing, and
you evolve, and you outgrow it.

00:44:09.762 --> 00:44:11.220 align:middle line:84%
And they said, it's
very important,

00:44:11.220 --> 00:44:14.490 align:middle line:84%
when a person feels that that
energy and that life they're

00:44:14.490 --> 00:44:18.300 align:middle line:84%
living has come to an end, to
consider choosing something

00:44:18.300 --> 00:44:21.450 align:middle line:84%
for themselves that
gives them the spirit

00:44:21.450 --> 00:44:25.290 align:middle line:84%
and the forward movement
they need to develop now,

00:44:25.290 --> 00:44:26.740 align:middle line:90%
from that point forward.

00:44:26.740 --> 00:44:28.770 align:middle line:84%
So name change is not
a bad thing to do.

00:44:28.770 --> 00:44:30.513 align:middle line:90%
First, last, middle, whatnot.

00:44:30.513 --> 00:44:31.680 align:middle line:90%
>>VALENTINE: No, not at all.

00:44:31.680 --> 00:44:33.180 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: You're just
changing frequencies

00:44:33.180 --> 00:44:35.055 align:middle line:84%
that you're identified
by, which is huge.

00:44:35.055 --> 00:44:36.390 align:middle line:90%
>>VALENTINE: Or even adding to.

00:44:36.390 --> 00:44:38.490 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And
adding to, exactly.

00:44:38.490 --> 00:44:40.170 align:middle line:84%
So I really like
the fact that you

00:44:40.170 --> 00:44:42.518 align:middle line:84%
do address that in the
book, because I too believe

00:44:42.518 --> 00:44:43.560 align:middle line:90%
that it's very important.

00:44:43.560 --> 00:44:45.570 align:middle line:84%
Actually, there was another
one I was doing a baby reading.

00:44:45.570 --> 00:44:47.520 align:middle line:84%
They said, no, her
name is Rebecca Miriam.

00:44:47.520 --> 00:44:49.180 align:middle line:84%
We're going after
the grandmothers.

00:44:49.180 --> 00:44:49.980 align:middle line:90%
Okey-dokey.

00:44:49.980 --> 00:44:51.720 align:middle line:90%
And I'd seen her name was Amy.

00:44:51.720 --> 00:44:53.370 align:middle line:90%
Little spark of sunshine.

00:44:53.370 --> 00:44:54.390 align:middle line:90%
Oh, my god.

00:44:54.390 --> 00:44:55.890 align:middle line:90%
So that was it.

00:44:55.890 --> 00:44:57.180 align:middle line:90%
And I was there for the birth.

00:44:57.180 --> 00:44:58.320 align:middle line:90%
I was helping.

00:44:58.320 --> 00:45:00.185 align:middle line:84%
And she is just a
spark of sunshine.

00:45:00.185 --> 00:45:02.310 align:middle line:84%
>>VALENTINE: I think that
intellect and ego get out

00:45:02.310 --> 00:45:06.900 align:middle line:84%
of the way during childbirth,
and the heart opens, and poof.

00:45:06.900 --> 00:45:09.030 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So the other
thing that we choose,

00:45:09.030 --> 00:45:10.980 align:middle line:84%
as many believe, is we
choose our birth time.

00:45:10.980 --> 00:45:11.780 align:middle line:90%
Right?

00:45:11.780 --> 00:45:12.250 align:middle line:90%
>>VALENTINE: Mhm.

00:45:12.250 --> 00:45:13.050 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

00:45:13.050 --> 00:45:15.300 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So our bodies
are born in a location,

00:45:15.300 --> 00:45:17.040 align:middle line:84%
because that's where
my mother's body is.

00:45:17.040 --> 00:45:18.082 align:middle line:90%
So then we're born there.

00:45:18.082 --> 00:45:20.260 align:middle line:84%
But we have more say over
the time of the birth

00:45:20.260 --> 00:45:21.718 align:middle line:84%
and when we're
going to pop through

00:45:21.718 --> 00:45:23.460 align:middle line:84%
into this reality,
and our names.

00:45:23.460 --> 00:45:27.790 align:middle line:84%
So let's talk about
numerology, and the usefulness

00:45:27.790 --> 00:45:31.390 align:middle line:84%
of understanding numerology
and your given birth name,

00:45:31.390 --> 00:45:33.860 align:middle line:90%
and also the time of your birth.

00:45:33.860 --> 00:45:34.660 align:middle line:90%
>>VALENTINE: Right.

00:45:34.660 --> 00:45:36.760 align:middle line:84%
All of these things, in a
way, are connected, really.

00:45:36.760 --> 00:45:38.552 align:middle line:84%
The things that we just
were talking about,

00:45:38.552 --> 00:45:41.140 align:middle line:84%
about choosing the
vibration of your--

00:45:41.140 --> 00:45:43.570 align:middle line:84%
and astrology,
very famously, also

00:45:43.570 --> 00:45:45.940 align:middle line:84%
needs to know the time
of your birth, right?

00:45:45.940 --> 00:45:49.700 align:middle line:84%
And so here, we have
numerology once again.

00:45:49.700 --> 00:45:51.970 align:middle line:84%
And so we have all of these
different modalities that

00:45:51.970 --> 00:45:54.070 align:middle line:84%
are all saying,
this really matters.

00:45:54.070 --> 00:45:55.400 align:middle line:90%
This really matters.

00:45:55.400 --> 00:45:57.880 align:middle line:84%
And so there are things
called master numbers.

00:45:57.880 --> 00:45:59.860 align:middle line:90%
There's your destiny number.

00:45:59.860 --> 00:46:02.950 align:middle line:84%
And these things tell
us a lot about not only

00:46:02.950 --> 00:46:06.850 align:middle line:84%
how we're wired
as people and what

00:46:06.850 --> 00:46:11.680 align:middle line:84%
situations we are most likely
to succeed in or be challenged

00:46:11.680 --> 00:46:15.410 align:middle line:84%
by, but also something
about our life purpose,

00:46:15.410 --> 00:46:18.880 align:middle line:84%
what we were meant
to do in this life,

00:46:18.880 --> 00:46:25.000 align:middle line:84%
and also how we perform
as a personality.

00:46:25.000 --> 00:46:27.760 align:middle line:84%
It's almost-- it can be
like a personality typing

00:46:27.760 --> 00:46:29.200 align:middle line:90%
like the Enneagram.

00:46:29.200 --> 00:46:30.910 align:middle line:90%
And it's quite astonishing.

00:46:30.910 --> 00:46:34.690 align:middle line:84%
I tinkered with numerology-- as
we said at the top of the show,

00:46:34.690 --> 00:46:36.233 align:middle line:84%
but I tinkered with
it a little bit.

00:46:36.233 --> 00:46:37.150 align:middle line:90%
But I kind of didn't--

00:46:37.150 --> 00:46:39.150 align:middle line:84%
I was kind of like,
numbers, numbers everywhere.

00:46:39.150 --> 00:46:40.330 align:middle line:90%
No more.

00:46:40.330 --> 00:46:44.110 align:middle line:84%
But I did have a
numerological reading

00:46:44.110 --> 00:46:46.870 align:middle line:84%
when I was in my early
20s by this woman who

00:46:46.870 --> 00:46:48.350 align:middle line:90%
was absolutely phenomenal.

00:46:48.350 --> 00:46:49.480 align:middle line:84%
Now, this will tell
you how old it is.

00:46:49.480 --> 00:46:50.480 align:middle line:90%
It's on a cassette tape.

00:46:50.480 --> 00:46:51.460 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Oh, yeah.

00:46:51.460 --> 00:46:52.450 align:middle line:90%
Gotcha.

00:46:52.450 --> 00:46:54.940 align:middle line:84%
>>VALENTINE: But she was
dead on about things that

00:46:54.940 --> 00:46:56.950 align:middle line:90%
were going on in my life.

00:46:56.950 --> 00:47:00.520 align:middle line:84%
And because, in numerology,
it breaks your life

00:47:00.520 --> 00:47:04.210 align:middle line:84%
into these life cycles, these
different pieces of the puzzle.

00:47:04.210 --> 00:47:07.660 align:middle line:84%
So the first 30
years of your life,

00:47:07.660 --> 00:47:10.190 align:middle line:84%
and then the next section,
and the next section.

00:47:10.190 --> 00:47:13.690 align:middle line:84%
And when I was moving from
Tennessee to Colorado,

00:47:13.690 --> 00:47:15.970 align:middle line:90%
I found this tape.

00:47:15.970 --> 00:47:18.670 align:middle line:90%
And now, this is 25 years later.

00:47:18.670 --> 00:47:20.240 align:middle line:90%
And I'm like, oh, I'm packing.

00:47:20.240 --> 00:47:21.370 align:middle line:90%
I'll play it.

00:47:21.370 --> 00:47:23.470 align:middle line:90%
I played it.

00:47:23.470 --> 00:47:25.360 align:middle line:90%
My jaw was on the floor.

00:47:25.360 --> 00:47:29.530 align:middle line:84%
Because she had predicted
things that were not

00:47:29.530 --> 00:47:32.350 align:middle line:84%
on my radar screen,
never would have dreamed

00:47:32.350 --> 00:47:33.460 align:middle line:90%
would have happened.

00:47:33.460 --> 00:47:36.940 align:middle line:84%
Never would have dreamed that my
14-year relationship would end.

00:47:36.940 --> 00:47:40.660 align:middle line:84%
Never would have dreamed that I
would move away from my family

00:47:40.660 --> 00:47:41.710 align:middle line:90%
to Colorado.

00:47:41.710 --> 00:47:44.920 align:middle line:84%
Never would have dreamed that I
would quit accounting and go--

00:47:44.920 --> 00:47:47.920 align:middle line:90%
and she nailed it.

00:47:47.920 --> 00:47:50.620 align:middle line:84%
And so that's the power of
numerology, because it's--

00:47:50.620 --> 00:47:51.340 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: It is pretty precise.

00:47:51.340 --> 00:47:51.670 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:47:51.670 --> 00:47:53.120 align:middle line:90%
>>VALENTINE: It's very precise.

00:47:53.120 --> 00:47:56.860 align:middle line:84%
It's not only
predictive, but it also

00:47:56.860 --> 00:48:02.890 align:middle line:84%
helps you to navigate your life,
almost like a prescription.

00:48:02.890 --> 00:48:04.570 align:middle line:90%
That's what I want to say.

00:48:04.570 --> 00:48:07.920 align:middle line:84%
It's very prescriptive
of our lives.

00:48:07.920 --> 00:48:10.510 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So for
people who operate more

00:48:10.510 --> 00:48:14.140 align:middle line:84%
in a logical framework, people
who do not like uncertainty

00:48:14.140 --> 00:48:17.610 align:middle line:84%
so much, that might be a
really good tool to use.

00:48:17.610 --> 00:48:18.610 align:middle line:90%
>>VALENTINE: Absolutely.

00:48:18.610 --> 00:48:19.695 align:middle line:90%
Absolutely.

00:48:19.695 --> 00:48:22.740 align:middle line:84%
And very often--
no offense, guys.

00:48:22.740 --> 00:48:26.830 align:middle line:84%
But very often, men
have more difficulty

00:48:26.830 --> 00:48:29.950 align:middle line:90%
with this than women do.

00:48:29.950 --> 00:48:33.720 align:middle line:84%
It's socially more acceptable
for women to be intuitive.

00:48:33.720 --> 00:48:36.790 align:middle line:84%
And so men might
back away from it.

00:48:36.790 --> 00:48:40.630 align:middle line:84%
And men might find that
whole left-brained aspect

00:48:40.630 --> 00:48:42.250 align:middle line:90%
to a language of the divine--

00:48:42.250 --> 00:48:45.910 align:middle line:84%
and essence is a
right-brained thing--

00:48:45.910 --> 00:48:49.120 align:middle line:84%
to be more comfortable,
to sit down and do math,

00:48:49.120 --> 00:48:50.370 align:middle line:90%
because there is math.

00:48:50.370 --> 00:48:52.767 align:middle line:90%
So that's the warning to people.

00:48:52.767 --> 00:48:54.100 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: There's math involved.

00:48:54.100 --> 00:48:55.380 align:middle line:90%
>>VALENTINE: There's math.

00:48:55.380 --> 00:48:56.290 align:middle line:90%
There's math.

00:48:56.290 --> 00:48:58.330 align:middle line:84%
It's not hard math,
but there's math.

00:48:58.330 --> 00:49:00.010 align:middle line:90%
And it does require study.

00:49:00.010 --> 00:49:04.780 align:middle line:84%
Numerology and astrology, I
make them as easy as I can.

00:49:04.780 --> 00:49:06.690 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: But do they
require more study.

00:49:06.690 --> 00:49:07.490 align:middle line:90%
Absolutely.

00:49:07.490 --> 00:49:08.698 align:middle line:90%
>>VALENTINE: They're complex.

00:49:08.698 --> 00:49:10.960 align:middle line:84%
You're not going to walk
away from Compendium,

00:49:10.960 --> 00:49:13.750 align:middle line:84%
having read those chapters,
and be a master astrologist.

00:49:13.750 --> 00:49:14.550 align:middle line:90%
You're not.

00:49:14.550 --> 00:49:15.760 align:middle line:90%
And I say that.

00:49:15.760 --> 00:49:18.850 align:middle line:84%
It's like, look, here's
how it functions.

00:49:18.850 --> 00:49:21.840 align:middle line:84%
I'm trying to make it
so you can understand.

00:49:21.840 --> 00:49:23.920 align:middle line:84%
But you're going to
have to go delve deeper.

00:49:23.920 --> 00:49:25.960 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Or just dabble and
just-- you get what you get.

00:49:25.960 --> 00:49:27.043 align:middle line:90%
>>VALENTINE: Well, dabble.

00:49:27.043 --> 00:49:27.850 align:middle line:90%
Dabbles are fun.

00:49:27.850 --> 00:49:29.980 align:middle line:84%
I mean, if it's not fun,
why are we doing it?

00:49:29.980 --> 00:49:30.780 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:49:30.780 --> 00:49:32.800 align:middle line:84%
No, and a lot of people
watching are dabblers.

00:49:32.800 --> 00:49:33.970 align:middle line:90%
I'm kind of a dabbler.

00:49:33.970 --> 00:49:36.730 align:middle line:84%
I would rather just kind of use
my direct intuition on things.

00:49:36.730 --> 00:49:39.910 align:middle line:84%
But it's fun to dabble sometimes
with these tools, as well.

00:49:39.910 --> 00:49:40.900 align:middle line:90%
I enjoy it.

00:49:40.900 --> 00:49:42.200 align:middle line:90%
And I have a question for you.

00:49:42.200 --> 00:49:45.100 align:middle line:84%
So years ago, a numerologist
did a chart for me--

00:49:45.100 --> 00:49:46.660 align:middle line:90%
this was many years ago.

00:49:46.660 --> 00:49:50.590 align:middle line:84%
And my birth name
number came out at a 22,

00:49:50.590 --> 00:49:52.790 align:middle line:90%
but I was born at 4:44.

00:49:52.790 --> 00:49:53.590 align:middle line:90%
>>VALENTINE: Wow!

00:49:53.590 --> 00:49:54.430 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So what
does that mean?

00:49:54.430 --> 00:49:56.960 align:middle line:84%
Because no one's ever actually
told me what that means.

00:49:56.960 --> 00:49:58.460 align:middle line:84%
>>VALENTINE: Oh,
my goodness, honey.

00:49:58.460 --> 00:50:01.760 align:middle line:84%
So 4:44 is typically meant to
mean the angels are with you.

00:50:01.760 --> 00:50:02.560 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Oh.

00:50:02.560 --> 00:50:03.560 align:middle line:90%
Well, I do feel that.

00:50:03.560 --> 00:50:04.360 align:middle line:90%
I feel very--

00:50:04.360 --> 00:50:05.670 align:middle line:90%
>>VALENTINE: I mean, 444 is--

00:50:05.670 --> 00:50:06.795 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: --very cared for.

00:50:06.795 --> 00:50:09.880 align:middle line:84%
>>VALENTINE: --one of the most
famous signs from the angels

00:50:09.880 --> 00:50:11.040 align:middle line:90%
to say, hey, we're here.

00:50:11.040 --> 00:50:12.290 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: We've got your back.

00:50:12.290 --> 00:50:13.120 align:middle line:84%
>>VALENTINE: We've
got your back.

00:50:13.120 --> 00:50:14.287 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Oh, that's lovely.

00:50:14.287 --> 00:50:16.840 align:middle line:84%
>>VALENTINE: And
22 reduces to 4.

00:50:16.840 --> 00:50:20.690 align:middle line:84%
So I mean, you are
angelically protected.

00:50:20.690 --> 00:50:23.330 align:middle line:90%
I mean, they really like you.

00:50:23.330 --> 00:50:25.286 align:middle line:90%
They really like you.

00:50:25.286 --> 00:50:28.310 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Well, I have
to say, I totally--

00:50:28.310 --> 00:50:29.930 align:middle line:90%
that's just part of me.

00:50:29.930 --> 00:50:32.420 align:middle line:84%
If I'm talking, I'm
talking as much to myself

00:50:32.420 --> 00:50:35.030 align:middle line:84%
as to the beings that are
around me all the time

00:50:35.030 --> 00:50:36.230 align:middle line:90%
and supporting me.

00:50:36.230 --> 00:50:38.240 align:middle line:84%
If I'm frustrated,
guys, come on.

00:50:38.240 --> 00:50:39.920 align:middle line:84%
Kick in and help
out on this one.

00:50:39.920 --> 00:50:42.230 align:middle line:84%
But the weird thing
is, even though I

00:50:42.230 --> 00:50:46.940 align:middle line:84%
know that's all around, I'm just
ridiculously kind of forgetful.

00:50:46.940 --> 00:50:48.248 align:middle line:90%
I forget to ask them for help.

00:50:48.248 --> 00:50:49.790 align:middle line:84%
>>VALENTINE: Welcome
to planet Earth.

00:50:49.790 --> 00:50:50.620 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Which is ridiculous--

00:50:50.620 --> 00:50:51.260 align:middle line:90%
>>VALENTINE: I know!

00:50:51.260 --> 00:50:52.927 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: --because
they're right there.

00:50:52.927 --> 00:50:54.695 align:middle line:84%
And when I ask for
help, they do miracles.

00:50:54.695 --> 00:50:55.300 align:middle line:90%
>>VALENTINE: Absolutely.

00:50:55.300 --> 00:50:56.760 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: It is
absolutely amazing.

00:50:56.760 --> 00:50:57.810 align:middle line:90%
And we all have them.

00:50:57.810 --> 00:50:59.350 align:middle line:90%
We all have our guides.

00:50:59.350 --> 00:51:00.850 align:middle line:84%
It's all right there
for the asking.

00:51:00.850 --> 00:51:01.650 align:middle line:90%
>>VALENTINE: Yeah.

00:51:01.650 --> 00:51:02.840 align:middle line:90%
I'm also a sci-fi nerd.

00:51:02.840 --> 00:51:04.965 align:middle line:84%
And so, with Star Trek,
they have this thing called

00:51:04.965 --> 00:51:07.730 align:middle line:84%
the prime directive, which
means you cannot interfere.

00:51:07.730 --> 00:51:08.530 align:middle line:90%
Right?

00:51:08.530 --> 00:51:10.310 align:middle line:84%
And it's like, angels
are the same way.

00:51:10.310 --> 00:51:10.640 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: They're the same.

00:51:10.640 --> 00:51:12.348 align:middle line:84%
>>VALENTINE: They have
a prime directive.

00:51:12.348 --> 00:51:15.210 align:middle line:84%
And so they will interfere
in certain situations--

00:51:15.210 --> 00:51:17.210 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: If it's traumatic
or life-threatening,

00:51:17.210 --> 00:51:17.900 align:middle line:90%
they can step in.

00:51:17.900 --> 00:51:19.070 align:middle line:84%
>>VALENTINE: Yeah,
then, they can step in.

00:51:19.070 --> 00:51:20.328 align:middle line:90%
But other than that--

00:51:20.328 --> 00:51:22.370 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Not to rob you
of your decision-making.

00:51:22.370 --> 00:51:23.170 align:middle line:90%
>>VALENTINE: Right.

00:51:23.170 --> 00:51:27.230 align:middle line:84%
Because we have free will, and
they will not mess with that.

00:51:27.230 --> 00:51:31.370 align:middle line:84%
And so I tell people, write the
word "ask" on a Post-It note

00:51:31.370 --> 00:51:33.710 align:middle line:84%
and put it on your
bathroom mirror.

00:51:33.710 --> 00:51:35.985 align:middle line:90%
Start every single day--

00:51:35.985 --> 00:51:36.785 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Ask.

00:51:36.785 --> 00:51:37.790 align:middle line:84%
>>VALENTINE:
--with, dear angels,

00:51:37.790 --> 00:51:39.830 align:middle line:84%
please protect me in
all ways, in all things,

00:51:39.830 --> 00:51:40.970 align:middle line:90%
in all directions of time.

00:51:40.970 --> 00:51:43.387 align:middle line:84%
Let there be no limit to the
ways in which you can help me

00:51:43.387 --> 00:51:44.360 align:middle line:90%
today.

00:51:44.360 --> 00:51:45.410 align:middle line:90%
Just put the word "ask."

00:51:45.410 --> 00:51:46.460 align:middle line:90%
Put it on your dashboard.

00:51:46.460 --> 00:51:47.790 align:middle line:90%
Put it on your computer.

00:51:47.790 --> 00:51:48.950 align:middle line:90%
By the way, move it around.

00:51:48.950 --> 00:51:50.150 align:middle line:90%
Because we're human and we--

00:51:50.150 --> 00:51:50.340 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Oh, yeah.

00:51:50.340 --> 00:51:51.640 align:middle line:90%
You don't see it after day two.

00:51:51.640 --> 00:51:52.765 align:middle line:90%
>>VALENTINE: And you don't.

00:51:52.765 --> 00:51:54.530 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: I know.

00:51:54.530 --> 00:51:56.740 align:middle line:84%
>>VALENTINE: But start
your day that way.

00:51:56.740 --> 00:51:57.770 align:middle line:90%
Start it that way.

00:51:57.770 --> 00:51:58.310 align:middle line:90%
You will be astonished.

00:51:58.310 --> 00:51:59.110 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:51:59.110 --> 00:52:03.530 align:middle line:84%
No, I think that that's such
good, sage, simple advice.

00:52:03.530 --> 00:52:05.240 align:middle line:90%
Because I need that, for sure.

00:52:05.240 --> 00:52:08.090 align:middle line:84%
And so if I'm kind of
taking that for granted

00:52:08.090 --> 00:52:10.400 align:middle line:84%
or not even thinking about
it I'm sure that most of us

00:52:10.400 --> 00:52:11.820 align:middle line:90%
are doing the same thing.

00:52:11.820 --> 00:52:13.250 align:middle line:90%
So all we have to do is ask.

00:52:13.250 --> 00:52:14.180 align:middle line:90%
It's all there.

00:52:14.180 --> 00:52:16.340 align:middle line:84%
And all we have to
do is start playing.

00:52:16.340 --> 00:52:18.980 align:middle line:84%
If we want to start
playing and reaching into--

00:52:18.980 --> 00:52:21.650 align:middle line:90%
I call it just the higher mind--

00:52:21.650 --> 00:52:25.580 align:middle line:84%
into the more highly
developed, spiritual aspect

00:52:25.580 --> 00:52:28.405 align:middle line:84%
of self that continues
throughout eternity,

00:52:28.405 --> 00:52:30.530 align:middle line:84%
these different tools are
a wonderful way to do it.

00:52:30.530 --> 00:52:32.930 align:middle line:84%
And it's a wonderful way to
get going, don't you think?

00:52:32.930 --> 00:52:33.240 align:middle line:90%
>>VALENTINE: Yes, absolutely.

00:52:33.240 --> 00:52:34.940 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Until you
ultimately can just

00:52:34.940 --> 00:52:36.260 align:middle line:90%
bring it through for yourself.

00:52:36.260 --> 00:52:37.080 align:middle line:90%
>>VALENTINE: Which you can do.

00:52:37.080 --> 00:52:38.960 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And so you were
doing that from an early age.

00:52:38.960 --> 00:52:40.668 align:middle line:84%
Then you started
playing with your tools.

00:52:40.668 --> 00:52:43.043 align:middle line:84%
But you've always been able
to bring it through, as well.

00:52:43.043 --> 00:52:44.418 align:middle line:84%
So do you think
it just gives you

00:52:44.418 --> 00:52:45.980 align:middle line:84%
a quicker access,
using your tools

00:52:45.980 --> 00:52:47.250 align:middle line:90%
and going into a stranger?

00:52:47.250 --> 00:52:47.630 align:middle line:90%
>>VALENTINE: Yeah.

00:52:47.630 --> 00:52:48.170 align:middle line:90%
Totally.

00:52:48.170 --> 00:52:49.045 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Absolutely.

00:52:49.045 --> 00:52:53.570 align:middle line:10%
>>VALENTINE: I mean, I do
totally honor people's privacy,

00:52:53.570 --> 00:52:55.310 align:middle line:10%
but I can't help it.

00:52:55.310 --> 00:53:00.010 align:middle line:84%
I have a sense of who
somebody is immediately.

00:53:00.010 --> 00:53:01.070 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:53:01.070 --> 00:53:02.910 align:middle line:90%
Well, there you go.

00:53:02.910 --> 00:53:04.290 align:middle line:90%
It's been a lovely conversation.

00:53:04.290 --> 00:53:07.280 align:middle line:84%
And I want to thank you so
much for your candor and just

00:53:07.280 --> 00:53:10.453 align:middle line:84%
your open-heartedness in
sharing your story with us.

00:53:10.453 --> 00:53:11.870 align:middle line:84%
Because I know a
lot of people can

00:53:11.870 --> 00:53:14.990 align:middle line:84%
relate to feeling
like the black sheep.

00:53:14.990 --> 00:53:16.532 align:middle line:84%
A lot of our viewers
are black sheep.

00:53:16.532 --> 00:53:18.782 align:middle line:84%
That's how they found their
way to all of these topics

00:53:18.782 --> 00:53:19.770 align:middle line:90%
to begin with.

00:53:19.770 --> 00:53:22.310 align:middle line:84%
And so thank you for sharing
your story in that first part

00:53:22.310 --> 00:53:23.480 align:middle line:90%
about our uniqueness.

00:53:23.480 --> 00:53:25.430 align:middle line:84%
And once you have
nothing to lose,

00:53:25.430 --> 00:53:27.360 align:middle line:90%
why not be who you fully are?

00:53:27.360 --> 00:53:28.160 align:middle line:90%
So thank you.

00:53:28.160 --> 00:53:29.300 align:middle line:84%
>>VALENTINE: Thank
you for having me.

00:53:29.300 --> 00:53:30.758 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: It was
absolutely lovely.

00:53:30.758 --> 00:53:31.760 align:middle line:90%
Thank you, Radleigh.

00:53:31.760 --> 00:53:33.230 align:middle line:10%
Again, the title
of Radleigh's book

00:53:33.230 --> 00:53:35.210 align:middle line:10%
is "A Compendium
of Magical Things--

00:53:35.210 --> 00:53:37.400 align:middle line:10%
Communicating with
the Divine to Create

00:53:37.400 --> 00:53:38.690 align:middle line:10%
the Life of Your Dreams."

00:53:38.690 --> 00:53:40.950 align:middle line:84%
And a new tarot deck
coming out, as well.

00:53:40.950 --> 00:53:42.950 align:middle line:84%
You can find these
at major booksellers.

00:53:42.950 --> 00:53:43.942 align:middle line:90%
Until next time.

00:53:43.942 --> 00:53:45.650 align:middle line:84%
Thank you for joining
us on "Open Minds."
