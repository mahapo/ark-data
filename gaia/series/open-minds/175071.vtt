00:00:17.574 --> 00:00:19.990 align:middle line:10%
>>REGINA MEREDITH: I'm sure
there are times when we've all

00:00:19.990 --> 00:00:21.610 align:middle line:10%
wondered if our
earthly behavior was

00:00:21.610 --> 00:00:24.580 align:middle line:10%
going to get us into the
good place after our deaths.

00:00:24.580 --> 00:00:26.710 align:middle line:84%
We may have also
wondered if we were

00:00:26.710 --> 00:00:29.470 align:middle line:84%
going to go to the bad place
and what that might be like,

00:00:29.470 --> 00:00:31.240 align:middle line:90%
if we believed in such things.

00:00:31.240 --> 00:00:33.250 align:middle line:84%
Today's guest, Dr.
Rajiv Parti, was

00:00:33.250 --> 00:00:35.950 align:middle line:84%
able to experience both during
his near-death experience,

00:00:35.950 --> 00:00:38.320 align:middle line:84%
and he's here to tell you
that one is definitely

00:00:38.320 --> 00:00:40.280 align:middle line:90%
better than the other.

00:00:40.280 --> 00:00:41.750 align:middle line:90%
It's wonderful to have you here.

00:00:41.750 --> 00:00:44.269 align:middle line:84%
I have to say, I thoroughly
enjoyed your book.

00:00:44.269 --> 00:00:45.310 align:middle line:10%
>>RAJIV PARTI: Thank you.

00:00:45.310 --> 00:00:46.540 align:middle line:10%
It's my pleasure to be here.

00:00:46.540 --> 00:00:48.520 align:middle line:10%
>>REGINA: It was
just a wonderful--

00:00:48.520 --> 00:00:51.850 align:middle line:10%
it was, I think, the most
frank look at one's own life

00:00:51.850 --> 00:00:53.440 align:middle line:10%
that I have ever seen.

00:00:53.440 --> 00:00:55.390 align:middle line:84%
I've interviewed
quite a few people

00:00:55.390 --> 00:00:58.240 align:middle line:84%
who've had near-death
experiences, and even

00:00:58.240 --> 00:01:01.367 align:middle line:84%
Doctor Raymond Moody,
you know, and many.

00:01:01.367 --> 00:01:02.950 align:middle line:10%
>>PARTI: Yeah, I've
been to his house.

00:01:02.950 --> 00:01:07.090 align:middle line:10%
>>REGINA: Yes, and he's a lovely
gentleman, and because you're

00:01:07.090 --> 00:01:09.160 align:middle line:10%
now out in the circuit
yourself, but I

00:01:09.160 --> 00:01:14.440 align:middle line:10%
have to say what was so
different about you is that you

00:01:14.440 --> 00:01:19.540 align:middle line:10%
had this ability to
articulate kind of the less

00:01:19.540 --> 00:01:22.060 align:middle line:10%
pleasant aspects of your
own character in life

00:01:22.060 --> 00:01:23.470 align:middle line:10%
like nobody else I'd seen.

00:01:23.470 --> 00:01:26.830 align:middle line:90%
It was so deeply honest and raw.

00:01:26.830 --> 00:01:29.890 align:middle line:84%
And it made the book just
come alive in its reality,

00:01:29.890 --> 00:01:31.930 align:middle line:84%
but it also set up
why you ended up

00:01:31.930 --> 00:01:34.445 align:middle line:84%
sitting on the precipice
there of the bad place.

00:01:34.445 --> 00:01:35.245 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHTER]

00:01:35.245 --> 00:01:37.490 align:middle line:84%
>>PARTI: That's so
true, that's true.

00:01:37.490 --> 00:01:39.890 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So let's just
talk about your career.

00:01:39.890 --> 00:01:41.749 align:middle line:84%
You're an
anesthesiologist-- and we'll

00:01:41.749 --> 00:01:43.540 align:middle line:84%
get into the way you
were living your life,

00:01:43.540 --> 00:01:45.880 align:middle line:84%
but I want to kind of
follow through your book.

00:01:45.880 --> 00:01:50.230 align:middle line:84%
And start with your
experience of the frozen man.

00:01:50.230 --> 00:01:53.230 align:middle line:84%
What you were doing, that
was really risky surgery,

00:01:53.230 --> 00:01:54.910 align:middle line:90%
and what happened afterwards.

00:01:54.910 --> 00:01:59.230 align:middle line:84%
>>PARTI: You know, I was chief
of anesthesia at Bakersfield

00:01:59.230 --> 00:02:01.660 align:middle line:84%
Heart Hospital,
where I specialized

00:02:01.660 --> 00:02:04.020 align:middle line:84%
in doing surgery and
giving anaesthesia

00:02:04.020 --> 00:02:05.300 align:middle line:90%
for surgeries of the heart.

00:02:05.300 --> 00:02:06.100 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:02:06.100 --> 00:02:06.250 align:middle line:10%
And

00:02:06.250 --> 00:02:08.530 align:middle line:10%
>>PARTI: There was
one special procedure

00:02:08.530 --> 00:02:11.380 align:middle line:10%
where we had to replace
the aorta, which

00:02:11.380 --> 00:02:14.390 align:middle line:10%
is the main artery, which
comes off the heart.

00:02:14.390 --> 00:02:18.940 align:middle line:84%
And in that procedure, the
only way it could be done

00:02:18.940 --> 00:02:21.610 align:middle line:84%
was what is called by
arresting the heart

00:02:21.610 --> 00:02:23.830 align:middle line:90%
and freezing the patient.

00:02:23.830 --> 00:02:25.447 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And when
you say freezing,

00:02:25.447 --> 00:02:27.280 align:middle line:84%
what happens to their
blood and how low does

00:02:27.280 --> 00:02:28.450 align:middle line:90%
the body temperature go?

00:02:28.450 --> 00:02:30.360 align:middle line:84%
>>PARTI: We go
down to 16 degrees.

00:02:30.360 --> 00:02:33.052 align:middle line:84%
It's called hypothermic
total circulatory rest.

00:02:33.052 --> 00:02:35.010 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: It's amazing
a body can survive this.

00:02:35.010 --> 00:02:37.940 align:middle line:84%
>>PARTI: And there's no
blood going anywhere.

00:02:37.940 --> 00:02:39.590 align:middle line:90%
And there's no brain functions.

00:02:39.590 --> 00:02:43.150 align:middle line:84%
We monitor the waves,
they're flatline, almost.

00:02:43.150 --> 00:02:45.460 align:middle line:84%
And kidneys are not working,
liver's not working,

00:02:45.460 --> 00:02:46.870 align:middle line:90%
heart is open.

00:02:46.870 --> 00:02:48.950 align:middle line:84%
I have even wondered,
is this patient alive,

00:02:48.950 --> 00:02:51.810 align:middle line:90%
and then you thaw--

00:02:51.810 --> 00:02:55.010 align:middle line:84%
and you have heard about animals
freezing and they wake up?

00:02:55.010 --> 00:02:58.360 align:middle line:84%
You warm up the patient,
the heart starts working,

00:02:58.360 --> 00:03:00.080 align:middle line:90%
the brain starts working.

00:03:00.080 --> 00:03:03.270 align:middle line:84%
But we only have limited
time, about 50 to 60 minutes.

00:03:03.270 --> 00:03:04.840 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Yeah, because I think
there would be permanent brain

00:03:04.840 --> 00:03:05.640 align:middle line:90%
damage.

00:03:05.640 --> 00:03:06.670 align:middle line:90%
>>PARTI: Yeah, exactly.

00:03:06.670 --> 00:03:07.350 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:03:07.350 --> 00:03:08.725 align:middle line:84%
>>PARTI: There's
very high chance

00:03:08.725 --> 00:03:11.140 align:middle line:84%
because there's no oxygen
going to the brain.

00:03:11.140 --> 00:03:12.640 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:03:12.640 --> 00:03:14.350 align:middle line:84%
So let's talk about
what happened.

00:03:14.350 --> 00:03:16.420 align:middle line:84%
>>PARTI: So that
patient, when he woke up,

00:03:16.420 --> 00:03:20.470 align:middle line:84%
he was describing to me
what happened in surgery.

00:03:20.470 --> 00:03:25.480 align:middle line:84%
What we were talking about,
the surgeon told a joke.

00:03:25.480 --> 00:03:28.250 align:middle line:84%
It's very common in
anesthesia for surgeons

00:03:28.250 --> 00:03:30.100 align:middle line:84%
and anaesthesiologists
to be joking around,

00:03:30.100 --> 00:03:32.050 align:middle line:90%
to make it a little lighter.

00:03:32.050 --> 00:03:34.090 align:middle line:84%
And the surgeon
was also describing

00:03:34.090 --> 00:03:36.502 align:middle line:84%
about his mother-in-law
and all of those things.

00:03:36.502 --> 00:03:38.460 align:middle line:84%
Sometimes I wondered if
the patient could hear,

00:03:38.460 --> 00:03:40.112 align:middle line:90%
what they would be thinking.

00:03:40.112 --> 00:03:41.070 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Now you know.

00:03:41.070 --> 00:03:42.570 align:middle line:90%
>>PARTI: Yeah.

00:03:42.570 --> 00:03:47.195 align:middle line:84%
But I thought this patient had
no blood going to his brain,

00:03:47.195 --> 00:03:50.660 align:middle line:84%
so probably he's hallucinating,
he had some brain damage,

00:03:50.660 --> 00:03:55.300 align:middle line:84%
and I just gave him a shot
of an antipsychotic, Haldol.

00:03:55.300 --> 00:03:59.867 align:middle line:84%
I said, he'll sleep for next
24 hours and then he'll go.

00:03:59.867 --> 00:04:01.700 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Well, that's
the interesting thing

00:04:01.700 --> 00:04:03.830 align:middle line:90%
because, other people--

00:04:03.830 --> 00:04:06.680 align:middle line:84%
and nurses in particular
noticed this with patients,

00:04:06.680 --> 00:04:09.560 align:middle line:84%
where they would talk about
the experience they had,

00:04:09.560 --> 00:04:12.570 align:middle line:84%
which defies anything that
you understood as reality.

00:04:12.570 --> 00:04:13.370 align:middle line:90%
>>PARTI: Yeah.

00:04:13.370 --> 00:04:15.036 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: But at this
point in your life

00:04:15.036 --> 00:04:18.140 align:middle line:84%
you weren't particularly
empathetic with what

00:04:18.140 --> 00:04:20.590 align:middle line:84%
people were going through
during this process.

00:04:20.590 --> 00:04:21.390 align:middle line:90%
>>PARTI: I wasn't.

00:04:21.390 --> 00:04:23.040 align:middle line:90%
I wasn't empathetic.

00:04:23.040 --> 00:04:26.390 align:middle line:84%
I was technically
very good, but I

00:04:26.390 --> 00:04:28.730 align:middle line:84%
didn't have that
emotional connection

00:04:28.730 --> 00:04:31.370 align:middle line:90%
or empathy for my patients.

00:04:31.370 --> 00:04:32.210 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:04:32.210 --> 00:04:37.225 align:middle line:84%
And you were living,
quote, "the good life",

00:04:37.225 --> 00:04:38.600 align:middle line:84%
and you were living
it in the way

00:04:38.600 --> 00:04:40.640 align:middle line:84%
that you were
expected to live it.

00:04:40.640 --> 00:04:42.250 align:middle line:90%
You had a wife and children.

00:04:42.250 --> 00:04:43.050 align:middle line:90%
>>PARTI: Yeah.

00:04:43.050 --> 00:04:45.080 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: And it took you to--

00:04:45.080 --> 00:04:49.190 align:middle line:84%
I found it interesting-- an
area that you and your friends

00:04:49.190 --> 00:04:51.230 align:middle line:84%
and the elite who could
afford to live there

00:04:51.230 --> 00:04:53.010 align:middle line:90%
called the bullseye.

00:04:53.010 --> 00:04:54.570 align:middle line:84%
So let's talk about
your lifestyle,

00:04:54.570 --> 00:04:57.124 align:middle line:84%
because you'd be like
this, to get out of surgery

00:04:57.124 --> 00:04:58.415 align:middle line:90%
and check your stock portfolio.

00:04:58.415 --> 00:04:59.540 align:middle line:90%
>>PARTI: Yeah.

00:04:59.540 --> 00:05:03.260 align:middle line:84%
I had two or three
different carriers,

00:05:03.260 --> 00:05:06.680 align:middle line:84%
like almost I was trading
stocks also in the morning,

00:05:06.680 --> 00:05:08.690 align:middle line:84%
because I was living
in California--

00:05:08.690 --> 00:05:10.190 align:middle line:90%
I still live there--

00:05:10.190 --> 00:05:12.890 align:middle line:84%
at 6:30 in the morning,
it's 9:30 in New York

00:05:12.890 --> 00:05:14.780 align:middle line:90%
when the stock market opens.

00:05:14.780 --> 00:05:17.150 align:middle line:84%
So when I was driving
to the hospital,

00:05:17.150 --> 00:05:20.270 align:middle line:84%
the surgeries usually
started around 7:30,

00:05:20.270 --> 00:05:22.150 align:middle line:90%
I would be talking to my broker.

00:05:22.150 --> 00:05:25.130 align:middle line:84%
Then every break I would be
talking to my broker, what

00:05:25.130 --> 00:05:29.670 align:middle line:84%
happened to Yahoo,
what happened to Apple,

00:05:29.670 --> 00:05:31.535 align:middle line:84%
these are the stocks
I was trading.

00:05:31.535 --> 00:05:33.140 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:05:33.140 --> 00:05:36.290 align:middle line:90%
So this allowed you to live--

00:05:36.290 --> 00:05:40.010 align:middle line:84%
that, and your position as
the chief of anaesthesiology--

00:05:40.010 --> 00:05:42.350 align:middle line:84%
allowed you to
live what one would

00:05:42.350 --> 00:05:45.930 align:middle line:84%
call kind of a rarefied life,
in terms of the material world.

00:05:45.930 --> 00:05:50.000 align:middle line:84%
>>PARTI: Yeah, rarefied
life, it was American dream

00:05:50.000 --> 00:05:51.946 align:middle line:90%
gone to the extreme.

00:05:51.946 --> 00:05:53.570 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Yeah, talk
about the extreme.

00:05:53.570 --> 00:05:55.670 align:middle line:84%
And you do this so
well in your book.

00:05:55.670 --> 00:05:57.910 align:middle line:90%
You're a fabulous writer.

00:05:57.910 --> 00:05:59.630 align:middle line:84%
But let's talk
about it in detail,

00:05:59.630 --> 00:06:03.350 align:middle line:84%
what it meant to finally
make it into the bullseye.

00:06:03.350 --> 00:06:04.580 align:middle line:90%
>>PARTI: Yeah, exactly.

00:06:04.580 --> 00:06:07.230 align:middle line:84%
You know, I came
to America in 1982

00:06:07.230 --> 00:06:09.830 align:middle line:84%
with only a few hundred
dollars in a pocket.

00:06:09.830 --> 00:06:12.050 align:middle line:84%
I had to pass my
medical school exams

00:06:12.050 --> 00:06:14.840 align:middle line:84%
to be able to work
in the United States.

00:06:14.840 --> 00:06:18.890 align:middle line:84%
I worked as a guard, I
drove a taxi in New York,

00:06:18.890 --> 00:06:23.750 align:middle line:84%
so I had big ambitions to have
a big house, big fancy cars,

00:06:23.750 --> 00:06:25.970 align:middle line:90%
go on expensive vacations.

00:06:25.970 --> 00:06:28.550 align:middle line:90%
So finally, after--

00:06:28.550 --> 00:06:32.390 align:middle line:84%
I think that must be about 20
years after I came to America,

00:06:32.390 --> 00:06:34.970 align:middle line:84%
I had that house
on a golf course

00:06:34.970 --> 00:06:37.670 align:middle line:84%
with a big theater
in itself, and it

00:06:37.670 --> 00:06:41.530 align:middle line:90%
had a beautiful view of a lake.

00:06:41.530 --> 00:06:45.745 align:middle line:84%
And I remember my mother-- my
father passed away many years

00:06:45.745 --> 00:06:46.545 align:middle line:90%
ago--

00:06:46.545 --> 00:06:48.210 align:middle line:84%
and when my mother
came to see me,

00:06:48.210 --> 00:06:50.370 align:middle line:90%
she said your house is a palace.

00:06:50.370 --> 00:06:53.070 align:middle line:84%
My first words were "Papa
would be very proud of me."

00:06:53.070 --> 00:06:55.137 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Right,
because this mattered.

00:06:55.137 --> 00:06:57.720 align:middle line:84%
I mean, this really mattered to
your father and to his father.

00:06:57.720 --> 00:06:59.310 align:middle line:84%
And we're going to
go in, later on,

00:06:59.310 --> 00:07:01.830 align:middle line:84%
to the back story of your
father and his father

00:07:01.830 --> 00:07:05.850 align:middle line:84%
and what was perpetuated by
way of emotional blockages

00:07:05.850 --> 00:07:07.920 align:middle line:84%
as a result of
that, and that made

00:07:07.920 --> 00:07:09.630 align:middle line:90%
you need to prove yourself.

00:07:09.630 --> 00:07:11.940 align:middle line:84%
So the bullseye, just
to get back to it,

00:07:11.940 --> 00:07:14.024 align:middle line:84%
is you're living in
a gated community--

00:07:14.024 --> 00:07:14.940 align:middle line:90%
>>PARTI: Double gated.

00:07:14.940 --> 00:07:15.898 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Double gated.

00:07:15.898 --> 00:07:18.040 align:middle line:84%
Yeah, I was going to
say, gate within gates,

00:07:18.040 --> 00:07:21.570 align:middle line:84%
and to get to the bullseye,
the area where you had replicas

00:07:21.570 --> 00:07:23.430 align:middle line:90%
of the White House.

00:07:23.430 --> 00:07:25.890 align:middle line:84%
>>PARTI: In front of me was
a replica of the White House.

00:07:25.890 --> 00:07:30.390 align:middle line:84%
My house was like a beautiful
Mediterranean villa.

00:07:30.390 --> 00:07:33.060 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Mediterranean
villa with way too many rooms

00:07:33.060 --> 00:07:34.980 align:middle line:90%
and too much square footage.

00:07:34.980 --> 00:07:37.230 align:middle line:90%
And you were driving a Hummer.

00:07:37.230 --> 00:07:39.660 align:middle line:84%
>>PARTI: Hummer
and a sports BMW.

00:07:39.660 --> 00:07:41.630 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Right, and
your wife had her cars.

00:07:41.630 --> 00:07:46.350 align:middle line:84%
And everybody was well taken
care of in the material sense,

00:07:46.350 --> 00:07:49.370 align:middle line:84%
but you said it
was almost like--

00:07:49.370 --> 00:07:52.640 align:middle line:84%
I think it was almost
like a Disneyland

00:07:52.640 --> 00:07:56.735 align:middle line:84%
for the ego, is when you started
looking at it for what it was

00:07:56.735 --> 00:07:59.630 align:middle line:84%
is, what are we all trying
to prove to each other?

00:07:59.630 --> 00:08:02.240 align:middle line:84%
Wasn't it all on the
bigger is better, more

00:08:02.240 --> 00:08:03.590 align:middle line:90%
square footage is better?

00:08:03.590 --> 00:08:06.320 align:middle line:84%
>>PARTI: Even people,
there was a competition

00:08:06.320 --> 00:08:08.850 align:middle line:84%
under the competition
among our friends.

00:08:08.850 --> 00:08:11.420 align:middle line:84%
If he built a 9,000
square foot house,

00:08:11.420 --> 00:08:15.200 align:middle line:84%
I'm going to build
at least 9,500.

00:08:15.200 --> 00:08:18.337 align:middle line:84%
And I even know of a
friend who added the room

00:08:18.337 --> 00:08:19.670 align:middle line:90%
to make the square footage more.

00:08:19.670 --> 00:08:21.590 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHTER]

00:08:21.590 --> 00:08:23.060 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: I just find it so--

00:08:23.060 --> 00:08:26.300 align:middle line:84%
I mean, in one way it's kind of
comical when you look at it now

00:08:26.300 --> 00:08:29.750 align:middle line:84%
from the outside, but
it causes vast amounts

00:08:29.750 --> 00:08:32.990 align:middle line:84%
of anxiety, stress, and pain
when you're inside that life.

00:08:32.990 --> 00:08:34.700 align:middle line:90%
>>PARTI: That's very true.

00:08:34.700 --> 00:08:37.760 align:middle line:84%
My mortgage almost
tripled or quadrupled

00:08:37.760 --> 00:08:41.570 align:middle line:84%
from a previous house,
and I was working

00:08:41.570 --> 00:08:46.790 align:middle line:84%
from 40 hours to 60, 70
hours to pay the mortgage.

00:08:46.790 --> 00:08:50.150 align:middle line:84%
And I used to joke
with my friends,

00:08:50.150 --> 00:08:53.840 align:middle line:84%
do I own the house
or the house owns me?

00:08:53.840 --> 00:08:54.729 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:08:54.729 --> 00:08:56.270 align:middle line:84%
>>PARTI: I was
working for the house.

00:08:56.270 --> 00:08:57.680 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right, right.

00:08:57.680 --> 00:09:01.610 align:middle line:84%
And how did your friends'
experiences-- did they ever

00:09:01.610 --> 00:09:03.500 align:middle line:90%
question it themselves?

00:09:03.500 --> 00:09:05.900 align:middle line:84%
Were you all just kind of
stuck in this game of bigger

00:09:05.900 --> 00:09:08.136 align:middle line:84%
is more, and having to
prove to each other?

00:09:08.136 --> 00:09:10.010 align:middle line:84%
>>PARTI: Yeah, we
questioned it a little bit,

00:09:10.010 --> 00:09:14.690 align:middle line:84%
but then we would get together,
have a party, drink some scotch

00:09:14.690 --> 00:09:16.880 align:middle line:84%
and talk about money
and stock market,

00:09:16.880 --> 00:09:19.550 align:middle line:84%
and there was never
really a discussion

00:09:19.550 --> 00:09:24.380 align:middle line:84%
of going inwards and
questioning what are we doing.

00:09:24.380 --> 00:09:26.650 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Well, this had
to take its toll somehow.

00:09:26.650 --> 00:09:30.780 align:middle line:84%
And I'm sure it did on some
of your friends as well.

00:09:30.780 --> 00:09:34.705 align:middle line:84%
But with you it started taking
its toll in the form of cancer,

00:09:34.705 --> 00:09:37.076 align:middle line:84%
and it also ended up
that you had to go

00:09:37.076 --> 00:09:38.200 align:middle line:90%
through multiple surgeries.

00:09:38.200 --> 00:09:40.940 align:middle line:84%
So tell us about that
journey and where you finally

00:09:40.940 --> 00:09:45.680 align:middle line:84%
ended up at this one surgery
that caused so many problems.

00:09:45.680 --> 00:09:49.340 align:middle line:84%
>>PARTI: What happened was I was
living a very stressful life.

00:09:49.340 --> 00:09:51.220 align:middle line:84%
And medically, it's
proven that when

00:09:51.220 --> 00:09:54.630 align:middle line:84%
you lead a very stressful life,
your body immunity goes down.

00:09:54.630 --> 00:09:55.430 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:09:55.430 --> 00:09:57.770 align:middle line:84%
>>PARTI: And we all are
producing cancer cells

00:09:57.770 --> 00:10:00.740 align:middle line:84%
all the time, but
immunity takes care of it.

00:10:00.740 --> 00:10:02.510 align:middle line:90%
It destroys them.

00:10:02.510 --> 00:10:05.844 align:middle line:84%
So I had gotten-- there's
a test known as PSA.

00:10:05.844 --> 00:10:06.760 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: It's a what?

00:10:06.760 --> 00:10:08.010 align:middle line:90%
>>PARTI: PSA is a blood test--

00:10:08.010 --> 00:10:09.134 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Oh yeah, PSA, OK.

00:10:09.134 --> 00:10:10.660 align:middle line:84%
>>PARTI: --to see
if you have any--

00:10:10.660 --> 00:10:12.810 align:middle line:84%
it's called prostate
specific antigen.

00:10:12.810 --> 00:10:13.610 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:10:13.610 --> 00:10:17.080 align:middle line:84%
>>PARTI: And to see if you
are-- it is a screen test.

00:10:17.080 --> 00:10:19.970 align:middle line:84%
My PSA had gone up,
and then the doctor

00:10:19.970 --> 00:10:22.550 align:middle line:84%
had done a biopsy
on my prostate.

00:10:22.550 --> 00:10:24.530 align:middle line:84%
And then one evening,
me and my wife

00:10:24.530 --> 00:10:27.330 align:middle line:84%
were sitting and having
tea in our backyard,

00:10:27.330 --> 00:10:28.470 align:middle line:90%
admiring the house--

00:10:28.470 --> 00:10:29.720 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: And the golf course.

00:10:29.720 --> 00:10:32.360 align:middle line:84%
>>PARTI: Golf course, where we
have come, you know, we finally

00:10:32.360 --> 00:10:37.900 align:middle line:84%
made it, then the urologist
called with the news

00:10:37.900 --> 00:10:39.430 align:middle line:90%
that I have prostate cancer.

00:10:39.430 --> 00:10:40.850 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Interesting timing.

00:10:40.850 --> 00:10:41.650 align:middle line:90%
>>PARTI: Yeah.

00:10:41.650 --> 00:10:44.750 align:middle line:84%
But he said there's a
good news, bad news.

00:10:44.750 --> 00:10:47.020 align:middle line:84%
The good news was it was
in very early stages,

00:10:47.020 --> 00:10:49.690 align:middle line:84%
and the bad news was
that it's cancer.

00:10:49.690 --> 00:10:52.510 align:middle line:84%
So I flew all the way to
Florida to get it operated,

00:10:52.510 --> 00:10:55.870 align:middle line:84%
because I did not want to
have a full open surgery.

00:10:55.870 --> 00:10:57.210 align:middle line:90%
I wanted to have a laparoscopic.

00:10:57.210 --> 00:10:59.769 align:middle line:84%
There was one doctor who
was doing laparoscopically.

00:10:59.769 --> 00:11:00.810 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: In Florida, OK.

00:11:00.810 --> 00:11:01.780 align:middle line:90%
>>PARTI: Yeah.

00:11:01.780 --> 00:11:06.460 align:middle line:84%
And then when I came back,
I did have complications

00:11:06.460 --> 00:11:09.370 align:middle line:84%
like, I would have
incontinence, I was not

00:11:09.370 --> 00:11:12.510 align:middle line:84%
able to control my bladder,
and then repeatedly

00:11:12.510 --> 00:11:16.020 align:middle line:84%
were the anastomosis was, after
the prostate was taken out,

00:11:16.020 --> 00:11:17.170 align:middle line:90%
it would get scarred.

00:11:17.170 --> 00:11:19.887 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So you really were
having a blocked urethra?

00:11:19.887 --> 00:11:21.845 align:middle line:84%
>>PARTI: Exactly, repeatedly
from the scarring.

00:11:21.845 --> 00:11:25.090 align:middle line:84%
So they had to go and
lance the scar or laser it.

00:11:25.090 --> 00:11:26.919 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So this
happened a few times.

00:11:26.919 --> 00:11:28.210 align:middle line:90%
>>PARTI: Yeah, about six times.

00:11:28.210 --> 00:11:32.770 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And then,
finally on December 20--

00:11:32.770 --> 00:11:34.767 align:middle line:90%
tell us what led up to that.

00:11:34.767 --> 00:11:36.850 align:middle line:84%
>>PARTI: Then what happened,
two years had passed,

00:11:36.850 --> 00:11:40.450 align:middle line:84%
and I was still not able to
control my bladder function.

00:11:40.450 --> 00:11:42.110 align:middle line:90%
And it was a nuisance.

00:11:42.110 --> 00:11:42.910 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:11:42.910 --> 00:11:44.980 align:middle line:84%
>>PARTI: And so
finally I went to UCLA

00:11:44.980 --> 00:11:48.310 align:middle line:84%
and they implanted a
device where I could

00:11:48.310 --> 00:11:50.170 align:middle line:90%
control my bladder function.

00:11:50.170 --> 00:11:54.030 align:middle line:84%
And that was done
about 10th of December

00:11:54.030 --> 00:11:58.320 align:middle line:84%
or so, but unfortunately
after that surgery,

00:11:58.320 --> 00:12:01.830 align:middle line:84%
I developed severe
infection, very high fevers

00:12:01.830 --> 00:12:05.580 align:middle line:84%
going up to 105, and
I was becoming septic.

00:12:05.580 --> 00:12:08.400 align:middle line:84%
Septic is when the
infection becomes severe

00:12:08.400 --> 00:12:11.430 align:middle line:84%
and it goes into the blood
and that can be very fatal.

00:12:11.430 --> 00:12:12.230 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:12:12.230 --> 00:12:15.100 align:middle line:84%
>>PARTI: Especially if one
goes into septic shock.

00:12:15.100 --> 00:12:20.040 align:middle line:84%
So we had to rush to
emergency room at UCLA

00:12:20.040 --> 00:12:23.090 align:middle line:84%
in Los Angeles from
Bakersfield, and that's

00:12:23.090 --> 00:12:26.805 align:middle line:84%
when they did the emergency
surgery to take the device out.

00:12:26.805 --> 00:12:28.680 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Now let's just
back up for a moment

00:12:28.680 --> 00:12:32.070 align:middle line:84%
before we go there, and
that is doctors are not

00:12:32.070 --> 00:12:33.992 align:middle line:90%
particularly good patients.

00:12:33.992 --> 00:12:36.450 align:middle line:84%
It sounds like-- I mean, I hear
this again and again, where

00:12:36.450 --> 00:12:38.220 align:middle line:84%
you can oftentimes
even ignore symptoms,

00:12:38.220 --> 00:12:39.720 align:middle line:84%
thinking it doesn't
matter, whatever

00:12:39.720 --> 00:12:41.460 align:middle line:90%
it is, we know how to fix it.

00:12:41.460 --> 00:12:42.330 align:middle line:90%
>>PARTI: Yeah.

00:12:42.330 --> 00:12:45.810 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: There's a kind of
almost a false confidence

00:12:45.810 --> 00:12:50.280 align:middle line:84%
that because you have
the tools to do so,

00:12:50.280 --> 00:12:51.780 align:middle line:84%
you can come in
at the last minute

00:12:51.780 --> 00:12:53.730 align:middle line:90%
and do miracles on each other.

00:12:53.730 --> 00:12:54.939 align:middle line:90%
>>PARTI: Yeah that's so true.

00:12:54.939 --> 00:12:56.771 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: You don't
take care of yourselves.

00:12:56.771 --> 00:12:58.710 align:middle line:84%
>>PARTI: We forget that
we are human beings

00:12:58.710 --> 00:12:59.627 align:middle line:90%
too with a human body.

00:12:59.627 --> 00:13:00.426 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right

00:13:00.426 --> 00:13:02.370 align:middle line:84%
>>PARTI: Because
society and we, ourself,

00:13:02.370 --> 00:13:06.000 align:middle line:84%
put ourselves on a pedestal,
that we are kind of super--

00:13:06.000 --> 00:13:09.000 align:middle line:84%
you we have super immunity
or super strengths.

00:13:09.000 --> 00:13:10.210 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah, not true.

00:13:10.210 --> 00:13:12.172 align:middle line:84%
And so you ignore
symptoms as a group,

00:13:12.172 --> 00:13:14.130 align:middle line:84%
and then you figure you'll
save each other when

00:13:14.130 --> 00:13:14.930 align:middle line:90%
it comes around.

00:13:14.930 --> 00:13:16.949 align:middle line:84%
So now you really-- this
time you needed saving.

00:13:16.949 --> 00:13:17.990 align:middle line:90%
>>PARTI: I needed saving.

00:13:17.990 --> 00:13:19.830 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So now it's
just before Christmas,

00:13:19.830 --> 00:13:24.750 align:middle line:84%
is that correct, the 23rd, which
your family had celebrations

00:13:24.750 --> 00:13:25.780 align:middle line:90%
ready to go.

00:13:25.780 --> 00:13:27.660 align:middle line:84%
and you were looking
forward to the season

00:13:27.660 --> 00:13:29.970 align:middle line:84%
and you were
feeling really sick.

00:13:29.970 --> 00:13:31.350 align:middle line:90%
>>PARTI: I was really sick.

00:13:31.350 --> 00:13:33.900 align:middle line:84%
So they had to do
an emergency surgery

00:13:33.900 --> 00:13:37.890 align:middle line:84%
on Christmas Day, because
they tried antibiotics

00:13:37.890 --> 00:13:40.430 align:middle line:84%
and that was not
having any effect.

00:13:40.430 --> 00:13:43.590 align:middle line:84%
And during the emergency surgery
was to take the device out,

00:13:43.590 --> 00:13:45.900 align:middle line:84%
because when there's
a foreign body

00:13:45.900 --> 00:13:48.870 align:middle line:84%
and it becomes a
source of infection,

00:13:48.870 --> 00:13:52.560 align:middle line:84%
then it has to be taken out,
there's no way around it,

00:13:52.560 --> 00:13:54.213 align:middle line:90%
after the antibiotics fail.

00:13:54.213 --> 00:13:57.330 align:middle line:90%


00:13:57.330 --> 00:14:00.350 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And by this time,
your whole pelvic cavity

00:14:00.350 --> 00:14:01.700 align:middle line:90%
is full of infection.

00:14:01.700 --> 00:14:02.510 align:middle line:90%
>>PARTI: Yeah.

00:14:02.510 --> 00:14:03.770 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: I mean, it's
just really awful.

00:14:03.770 --> 00:14:05.515 align:middle line:84%
We won't go into
the details what it

00:14:05.515 --> 00:14:07.220 align:middle line:90%
means to release all of that.

00:14:07.220 --> 00:14:08.970 align:middle line:84%
But you have to go
through that process.

00:14:08.970 --> 00:14:12.890 align:middle line:84%
So let's talk about what
happened then after that--

00:14:12.890 --> 00:14:14.210 align:middle line:90%
during that.

00:14:14.210 --> 00:14:17.030 align:middle line:84%
>>PARTI: During surgery,
about 20 minutes in surgery,

00:14:17.030 --> 00:14:21.860 align:middle line:84%
my blood pressure
fell and I saw myself

00:14:21.860 --> 00:14:25.030 align:middle line:84%
floating near the
ceiling, and I could see

00:14:25.030 --> 00:14:27.390 align:middle line:90%
what the surgery was going on.

00:14:27.390 --> 00:14:30.360 align:middle line:84%
And the anaesthesiologist
told a joke,

00:14:30.360 --> 00:14:33.350 align:middle line:84%
which I remembered very well,
but I can't write in a book

00:14:33.350 --> 00:14:35.670 align:middle line:84%
or tell you because it
was not a clean joke.

00:14:35.670 --> 00:14:36.920 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah, off-color

00:14:36.920 --> 00:14:38.180 align:middle line:90%
>>PARTI: Off-color, exactly.

00:14:38.180 --> 00:14:41.670 align:middle line:84%
Because as I told
you before, we try

00:14:41.670 --> 00:14:43.230 align:middle line:90%
to keep the atmosphere light.

00:14:43.230 --> 00:14:44.030 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:14:44.030 --> 00:14:48.300 align:middle line:84%
>>PARTI: And from there I
traveled to different realms.

00:14:48.300 --> 00:14:49.100 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:14:49.100 --> 00:14:50.870 align:middle line:84%
>>PARTI: And one of
the realms I went to

00:14:50.870 --> 00:14:55.790 align:middle line:84%
was what is described
in Indian culture,

00:14:55.790 --> 00:14:59.780 align:middle line:84%
or even, to some extent,
Judeo-Christian culture,

00:14:59.780 --> 00:15:01.940 align:middle line:90%
called Naraka.

00:15:01.940 --> 00:15:03.950 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Which is
hell, basically hell.

00:15:03.950 --> 00:15:06.260 align:middle line:84%
But before you went
there, I thought

00:15:06.260 --> 00:15:11.420 align:middle line:84%
what was really interesting
is the men in your lineage

00:15:11.420 --> 00:15:14.540 align:middle line:84%
had raised each other to
be something, but harsh,

00:15:14.540 --> 00:15:16.490 align:middle line:84%
because of the pain
they had endured.

00:15:16.490 --> 00:15:18.690 align:middle line:90%
Very harsh values.

00:15:18.690 --> 00:15:20.700 align:middle line:84%
The place you went
was to your sister

00:15:20.700 --> 00:15:22.320 align:middle line:90%
and your mother first in India.

00:15:22.320 --> 00:15:23.120 align:middle line:90%
>>PARTI: India.

00:15:23.120 --> 00:15:25.660 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Making lentil
soup, dal, right?

00:15:25.660 --> 00:15:27.140 align:middle line:90%
>>PARTI: Yeah, dal, exactly.

00:15:27.140 --> 00:15:30.815 align:middle line:84%
And it was evening time
there, and it was winter.

00:15:30.815 --> 00:15:32.190 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And it's
like you said,

00:15:32.190 --> 00:15:34.648 align:middle line:84%
when you were out of your body,
if you turned your head one

00:15:34.648 --> 00:15:38.220 align:middle line:84%
direction you were watching the
surgeons and what was going on.

00:15:38.220 --> 00:15:40.730 align:middle line:84%
But if you turned your
head the other direction

00:15:40.730 --> 00:15:42.320 align:middle line:84%
you were with your
mother and sister.

00:15:42.320 --> 00:15:42.740 align:middle line:90%
>>PARTI: Yeah.

00:15:42.740 --> 00:15:44.614 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So let's talk
about your experience

00:15:44.614 --> 00:15:46.434 align:middle line:84%
and why you went
there and the love.

00:15:46.434 --> 00:15:48.350 align:middle line:84%
>>PARTI: And the love
was there, and because--

00:15:48.350 --> 00:15:50.870 align:middle line:84%
I discussed this
with Dr. Moody also--

00:15:50.870 --> 00:15:55.160 align:middle line:84%
because in the other realm,
time and space are not there.

00:15:55.160 --> 00:15:57.510 align:middle line:84%
So you can be in two
places at the same time

00:15:57.510 --> 00:15:58.310 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:15:58.310 --> 00:16:00.640 align:middle line:84%
>>PARTI: That was
very shocking to me.

00:16:00.640 --> 00:16:02.090 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Because you didn't
believe in any of this, really.

00:16:02.090 --> 00:16:02.660 align:middle line:90%
>>PARTI: I didn't.

00:16:02.660 --> 00:16:04.660 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Although, just
as a little back story,

00:16:04.660 --> 00:16:07.490 align:middle line:84%
you had gone into some
comparative religious study

00:16:07.490 --> 00:16:08.760 align:middle line:90%
when you were in your youth.

00:16:08.760 --> 00:16:10.002 align:middle line:90%
>>PARTI: Yeah, when I was 18.

00:16:10.002 --> 00:16:10.960 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: 18 years old.

00:16:10.960 --> 00:16:14.150 align:middle line:84%
So you knew a little bit about
some of the beings and such,

00:16:14.150 --> 00:16:15.770 align:middle line:84%
but that's not
where your life was.

00:16:15.770 --> 00:16:17.660 align:middle line:84%
>>PARTI: No, when
I came to America--

00:16:17.660 --> 00:16:18.440 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: That was all gone.

00:16:18.440 --> 00:16:19.040 align:middle line:90%
>>PARTI: It was all gone.

00:16:19.040 --> 00:16:20.289 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Material world here.

00:16:20.289 --> 00:16:21.130 align:middle line:90%
>>PARTI: Material.

00:16:21.130 --> 00:16:21.550 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Hummer.

00:16:21.550 --> 00:16:22.350 align:middle line:90%
>>PARTI: Hummer.

00:16:22.350 --> 00:16:23.300 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:16:23.300 --> 00:16:24.320 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: The bullseye.

00:16:24.320 --> 00:16:28.430 align:middle line:84%
OK, so just explain a little
bit about that feeling

00:16:28.430 --> 00:16:30.350 align:middle line:84%
and what happened when
you tried to connect

00:16:30.350 --> 00:16:32.800 align:middle line:84%
with your mother
and your sister.

00:16:32.800 --> 00:16:35.120 align:middle line:84%
>>PARTI: But they could
not hear me, but I--

00:16:35.120 --> 00:16:37.790 align:middle line:84%
about a week later or
so when I was well,

00:16:37.790 --> 00:16:41.077 align:middle line:84%
I called them and I described
the whole conversation--

00:16:41.077 --> 00:16:42.410 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: That they were having.

00:16:42.410 --> 00:16:43.493 align:middle line:90%
>>PARTI: They were having.

00:16:43.493 --> 00:16:44.690 align:middle line:90%
They were shocked.

00:16:44.690 --> 00:16:45.740 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:16:45.740 --> 00:16:46.823 align:middle line:90%
Because this is different.

00:16:46.823 --> 00:16:48.860 align:middle line:90%
Now most people don't have that.

00:16:48.860 --> 00:16:50.900 align:middle line:84%
Sometimes they'll
go with one person,

00:16:50.900 --> 00:16:53.960 align:middle line:84%
but they're not necessarily
bilocated like you were.

00:16:53.960 --> 00:16:56.300 align:middle line:84%
You could hear conversations
in both domains.

00:16:56.300 --> 00:16:57.380 align:middle line:90%
>>PARTI: Both domains.

00:16:57.380 --> 00:17:00.590 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And so what
I found interesting is

00:17:00.590 --> 00:17:02.930 align:middle line:84%
that when you got
out of your body,

00:17:02.930 --> 00:17:05.630 align:middle line:84%
the place your
being chose to take

00:17:05.630 --> 00:17:07.460 align:middle line:84%
you was to your
mother and sister,

00:17:07.460 --> 00:17:09.020 align:middle line:84%
because you were
observing this kind

00:17:09.020 --> 00:17:12.890 align:middle line:84%
of feminine connection,
genuine connection and love

00:17:12.890 --> 00:17:14.089 align:middle line:90%
between them.

00:17:14.089 --> 00:17:18.109 align:middle line:84%
>>PARTI: And between them, and
I was very connected to my mom.

00:17:18.109 --> 00:17:20.839 align:middle line:90%
We have the same birthday.

00:17:20.839 --> 00:17:22.970 align:middle line:84%
My father used to tell
my mom what else do you

00:17:22.970 --> 00:17:23.920 align:middle line:90%
want for birthday?

00:17:23.920 --> 00:17:25.069 align:middle line:90%
I gave you a son.

00:17:25.069 --> 00:17:26.660 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Right,
and you were trying

00:17:26.660 --> 00:17:28.520 align:middle line:90%
to reach in and touch her, even.

00:17:28.520 --> 00:17:29.630 align:middle line:90%
They couldn't feel you.

00:17:29.630 --> 00:17:31.080 align:middle line:90%
They couldn't hear you.

00:17:31.080 --> 00:17:32.370 align:middle line:90%
>>PARTI: No.

00:17:32.370 --> 00:17:34.140 align:middle line:90%
It's like the movie "Ghost".

00:17:34.140 --> 00:17:34.940 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:17:34.940 --> 00:17:38.210 align:middle line:84%
>>PARTI: You know, that movie
"Ghost" when he tries to talk?

00:17:38.210 --> 00:17:39.167 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:17:39.167 --> 00:17:40.600 align:middle line:90%
>>PARTI: It was like that.

00:17:40.600 --> 00:17:43.370 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And so after you
visited your mom and sister

00:17:43.370 --> 00:17:46.700 align:middle line:84%
and realized you couldn't
really interact with them, then

00:17:46.700 --> 00:17:47.630 align:middle line:90%
what happened?

00:17:47.630 --> 00:17:51.927 align:middle line:84%
>>PARTI: Then I found
myself in a hellish realm.

00:17:51.927 --> 00:17:54.260 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Let's talk about
what that was like, from what

00:17:54.260 --> 00:17:55.520 align:middle line:90%
you could feel and see.

00:17:55.520 --> 00:17:57.890 align:middle line:84%
>>PARTI: I could
hear souls crying,

00:17:57.890 --> 00:18:05.420 align:middle line:84%
and I was being kind of tortured
too, and I was crying for help.

00:18:05.420 --> 00:18:10.660 align:middle line:84%
It was very painful, and I
did not want to be there.

00:18:10.660 --> 00:18:13.450 align:middle line:84%
And the person who
showed up was my father.

00:18:13.450 --> 00:18:14.990 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And you
heard words, too.

00:18:14.990 --> 00:18:15.790 align:middle line:90%
>>PARTI: Yeah.

00:18:15.790 --> 00:18:18.580 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: There were
words about not living.

00:18:18.580 --> 00:18:22.200 align:middle line:84%
You weren't making love, in the
truest sense, with your life.

00:18:22.200 --> 00:18:27.520 align:middle line:84%
>>PARTI: Yeah, my father
told me that you are not

00:18:27.520 --> 00:18:29.410 align:middle line:90%
living a purposeful life.

00:18:29.410 --> 00:18:33.070 align:middle line:84%
And he repeated the words what
he had told me on his deathbed.

00:18:33.070 --> 00:18:35.840 align:middle line:84%
And the words-- he
said it in Indian,

00:18:35.840 --> 00:18:37.450 align:middle line:84%
but translated
into English were,

00:18:37.450 --> 00:18:39.850 align:middle line:84%
if you keep your
consciousness clear,

00:18:39.850 --> 00:18:42.780 align:middle line:84%
the divine, the universe
will take care of you.

00:18:42.780 --> 00:18:44.890 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And you
were not in that zone.

00:18:44.890 --> 00:18:46.540 align:middle line:90%
>>PARTI: I was not in that zone.

00:18:46.540 --> 00:18:49.510 align:middle line:84%
For me, getting
ahead, no matter what,

00:18:49.510 --> 00:18:54.370 align:middle line:84%
how many toes I have to step
on, was the primary goal.

00:18:54.370 --> 00:18:58.810 align:middle line:84%
I was a typical
alpha, charging male.

00:18:58.810 --> 00:19:01.060 align:middle line:90%
Get ahead at any cost.

00:19:01.060 --> 00:19:03.810 align:middle line:84%
I remember so many patients
that wanted to talk to me.

00:19:03.810 --> 00:19:05.570 align:middle line:84%
I had a pain management
practice, too.

00:19:05.570 --> 00:19:06.370 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:19:06.370 --> 00:19:08.960 align:middle line:90%
>>PARTI: And we used to see--

00:19:08.960 --> 00:19:09.980 align:middle line:90%
I was the fastest.

00:19:09.980 --> 00:19:13.490 align:middle line:84%
I could see six
patients in one hour.

00:19:13.490 --> 00:19:16.937 align:middle line:84%
And 10 minutes per patient
is very little time.

00:19:16.937 --> 00:19:19.020 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: To really
understand the nature of pain.

00:19:19.020 --> 00:19:19.210 align:middle line:90%
>>PARTI: Yeah.

00:19:19.210 --> 00:19:21.110 align:middle line:84%
But what I did was
write a prescription

00:19:21.110 --> 00:19:24.350 align:middle line:84%
for Vicodin or
narcotics, and they

00:19:24.350 --> 00:19:28.400 align:middle line:84%
would want to talk to me, where
I said, take a prescription.

00:19:28.400 --> 00:19:31.640 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Right, and even
with these other experiences,

00:19:31.640 --> 00:19:33.800 align:middle line:84%
it's like you give them
an anti-psychotic drug.

00:19:33.800 --> 00:19:34.100 align:middle line:90%
>>PARTI: Yes.

00:19:34.100 --> 00:19:34.940 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Just
write them a script,

00:19:34.940 --> 00:19:36.814 align:middle line:84%
get them out of your
face so you can go check

00:19:36.814 --> 00:19:38.170 align:middle line:90%
on the stock portfolio.

00:19:38.170 --> 00:19:39.170 align:middle line:90%
>>PARTI: That's so true.

00:19:39.170 --> 00:19:40.961 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And at the
same time, because you

00:19:40.961 --> 00:19:43.380 align:middle line:84%
had these problems going on
in your life with your body,

00:19:43.380 --> 00:19:46.100 align:middle line:84%
you were becoming addicted
to pharmaceuticals.

00:19:46.100 --> 00:19:47.480 align:middle line:90%
>>PARTI: Exactly.

00:19:47.480 --> 00:19:51.710 align:middle line:84%
I was prescribed, because
of the surgeries I had,

00:19:51.710 --> 00:19:54.590 align:middle line:84%
I was prescribed pain
medicines myself,

00:19:54.590 --> 00:19:56.870 align:middle line:84%
and I became
dependent upon them.

00:19:56.870 --> 00:19:57.920 align:middle line:90%
You'd be surprised.

00:19:57.920 --> 00:20:02.300 align:middle line:84%
In America narcotics
now are a bigger problem

00:20:02.300 --> 00:20:03.689 align:middle line:90%
than illegal drugs.

00:20:03.689 --> 00:20:04.730 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Oh, absolutely.

00:20:04.730 --> 00:20:06.346 align:middle line:90%
>>PARTI: Prescription narcotics.

00:20:06.346 --> 00:20:07.220 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Absolutely.

00:20:07.220 --> 00:20:12.680 align:middle line:84%
Well, when you look at the stats
that doctor care, medical care

00:20:12.680 --> 00:20:15.380 align:middle line:84%
is the third or fourth
leading cause of death,

00:20:15.380 --> 00:20:17.865 align:middle line:84%
a huge part of that has
to be prescription drugs.

00:20:17.865 --> 00:20:18.665 align:middle line:90%
>>PARTI: Yeah.

00:20:18.665 --> 00:20:21.680 align:middle line:90%


00:20:21.680 --> 00:20:25.080 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: These are
astounding numbers.

00:20:25.080 --> 00:20:28.700 align:middle line:84%
Why is the medical industry
not paying attention to this?

00:20:28.700 --> 00:20:31.850 align:middle line:84%
>>PARTI: Because
people like me, who

00:20:31.850 --> 00:20:34.010 align:middle line:84%
want to just give
the prescription

00:20:34.010 --> 00:20:38.240 align:middle line:84%
and not look good at alternate
ways of helping the patient.

00:20:38.240 --> 00:20:39.600 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Well, that is true.

00:20:39.600 --> 00:20:41.270 align:middle line:84%
So now you're paying
for it, you're

00:20:41.270 --> 00:20:44.690 align:middle line:84%
on the precipice of
basically a hellish realm.

00:20:44.690 --> 00:20:47.180 align:middle line:84%
Souls are screaming
out in suffering.

00:20:47.180 --> 00:20:49.190 align:middle line:84%
And what else did you
observe about that realm,

00:20:49.190 --> 00:20:50.950 align:middle line:84%
because most people
I've done these--

00:20:50.950 --> 00:20:52.130 align:middle line:90%
>>PARTI: There was fire.

00:20:52.130 --> 00:20:52.610 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: OK.

00:20:52.610 --> 00:20:54.910 align:middle line:84%
>>PARTI: There was fire and
there was a thunderstorm.

00:20:54.910 --> 00:20:55.975 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Thunderstorm.

00:20:55.975 --> 00:20:59.340 align:middle line:84%
Oh, you said, these thickening
black clouds and clap

00:20:59.340 --> 00:21:00.140 align:middle line:90%
of thunder.

00:21:00.140 --> 00:21:01.010 align:middle line:90%
>>PARTI: Yeah.

00:21:01.010 --> 00:21:05.040 align:middle line:84%
And I was very terrified,
and I had tears in my eyes,

00:21:05.040 --> 00:21:06.215 align:middle line:90%
and I was in pain.

00:21:06.215 --> 00:21:08.505 align:middle line:84%
And that's when my
father showed up.

00:21:08.505 --> 00:21:09.880 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And your
father and you

00:21:09.880 --> 00:21:11.190 align:middle line:90%
had a challenged relationship.

00:21:11.190 --> 00:21:13.310 align:middle line:84%
>>PARTI: A very
challenging relationship,

00:21:13.310 --> 00:21:17.030 align:middle line:84%
because my father was a product
of the partition of India.

00:21:17.030 --> 00:21:21.240 align:middle line:84%
In 1947, Pakistan
came in to being.

00:21:21.240 --> 00:21:22.320 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Pakistan, yeah.

00:21:22.320 --> 00:21:24.150 align:middle line:84%
>>PARTI: And it was
based on religion.

00:21:24.150 --> 00:21:24.650 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:21:24.650 --> 00:21:26.191 align:middle line:84%
>>PARTI: My family
is a Hindu family,

00:21:26.191 --> 00:21:28.727 align:middle line:84%
and my family was living
on what became Pakistan.

00:21:28.727 --> 00:21:29.810 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Which is Muslim.

00:21:29.810 --> 00:21:31.070 align:middle line:90%
>>PARTI: Which is Muslim.

00:21:31.070 --> 00:21:33.225 align:middle line:84%
So there was genocide
on both sides.

00:21:33.225 --> 00:21:34.850 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Talk about
that a little bit,

00:21:34.850 --> 00:21:37.100 align:middle line:84%
because a lot of
Americans in particular

00:21:37.100 --> 00:21:39.670 align:middle line:84%
don't understand our
history all that well,

00:21:39.670 --> 00:21:40.670 align:middle line:90%
and what happened there?

00:21:40.670 --> 00:21:42.919 align:middle line:84%
So they can have a little
bit of a glimpse into what's

00:21:42.919 --> 00:21:44.180 align:middle line:90%
happening today, even.

00:21:44.180 --> 00:21:45.990 align:middle line:84%
>>PARTI: Oh yeah,
that's very true.

00:21:45.990 --> 00:21:49.040 align:middle line:84%
So basically since
the politics was there

00:21:49.040 --> 00:21:52.160 align:middle line:84%
and they divided the
country based on religion,

00:21:52.160 --> 00:21:54.230 align:middle line:84%
the Muslims wanted to
get rid of all Hindus,

00:21:54.230 --> 00:21:56.570 align:middle line:84%
and Hindus wanted to
get rid of all Muslims.

00:21:56.570 --> 00:21:58.947 align:middle line:84%
So they just started
butchering each other.

00:21:58.947 --> 00:22:00.530 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And there
was mass genocide.

00:22:00.530 --> 00:22:01.905 align:middle line:84%
>>PARTI: There
was mass genocide.

00:22:01.905 --> 00:22:03.470 align:middle line:10%
The whole cities
would be burned,

00:22:03.470 --> 00:22:06.419 align:middle line:10%
the whole houses would be
burned with people alight.

00:22:06.419 --> 00:22:07.460 align:middle line:10%
So people would run away.

00:22:07.460 --> 00:22:11.060 align:middle line:10%
When my father was 18,
and he ran-- whole trains

00:22:11.060 --> 00:22:12.370 align:middle line:10%
used to be massacred.

00:22:12.370 --> 00:22:16.700 align:middle line:10%
A train would be at a
stop and the opposite

00:22:16.700 --> 00:22:19.010 align:middle line:10%
would come and kill everybody.

00:22:19.010 --> 00:22:22.940 align:middle line:84%
So my father came hiding
among dead bodies.

00:22:22.940 --> 00:22:28.090 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And he-- when he made
his way over from Pakistan, it

00:22:28.090 --> 00:22:30.770 align:middle line:84%
was assumed that
he was a Muslim.

00:22:30.770 --> 00:22:35.180 align:middle line:84%
>>PARTI: Because he was
wearing Muslim clothes.

00:22:35.180 --> 00:22:36.740 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: From the culture.

00:22:36.740 --> 00:22:39.920 align:middle line:84%
And so the humiliation
he had to go through,

00:22:39.920 --> 00:22:41.240 align:middle line:90%
I found just really--

00:22:41.240 --> 00:22:43.750 align:middle line:84%
not just sad, but
very touching also,

00:22:43.750 --> 00:22:46.940 align:middle line:84%
in that the Hindu population
is not circumcised

00:22:46.940 --> 00:22:48.720 align:middle line:90%
and the Muslim population is.

00:22:48.720 --> 00:22:52.280 align:middle line:84%
So he would go somewhere and
they would pull his pants down

00:22:52.280 --> 00:22:54.850 align:middle line:84%
in public, have him
pull his pants down

00:22:54.850 --> 00:22:56.570 align:middle line:90%
to prove that he was a Hindu.

00:22:56.570 --> 00:22:58.200 align:middle line:90%
And this wasn't just one time.

00:22:58.200 --> 00:22:59.000 align:middle line:90%
>>PARTI: Few times.

00:22:59.000 --> 00:22:59.916 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: A few times.

00:22:59.916 --> 00:23:03.470 align:middle line:84%
>>PARTI: And he lost
contact with my grandmother.

00:23:03.470 --> 00:23:06.490 align:middle line:84%
For two years my
grandmother didn't know

00:23:06.490 --> 00:23:08.510 align:middle line:90%
if my father was alive or not.

00:23:08.510 --> 00:23:09.410 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:23:09.410 --> 00:23:12.620 align:middle line:84%
So this was a really
cruel time in history.

00:23:12.620 --> 00:23:17.060 align:middle line:84%
His experience was such that he
was repeatedly humiliated, lost

00:23:17.060 --> 00:23:19.370 align:middle line:84%
contact with the people
he loved, and let's

00:23:19.370 --> 00:23:21.970 align:middle line:84%
talk about the rest of his
journey, then, after that,

00:23:21.970 --> 00:23:22.820 align:middle line:90%
after he made it.

00:23:22.820 --> 00:23:24.350 align:middle line:84%
>>PARTI: After he
moved to India,

00:23:24.350 --> 00:23:26.580 align:middle line:90%
his education was cut short.

00:23:26.580 --> 00:23:27.647 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: His what?

00:23:27.647 --> 00:23:28.480 align:middle line:90%
>>PARTI: Education--

00:23:28.480 --> 00:23:29.315 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Was cut short.

00:23:29.315 --> 00:23:29.510 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

00:23:29.510 --> 00:23:31.770 align:middle line:84%
>>PARTI: He could not become
what he wanted to become.

00:23:31.770 --> 00:23:32.570 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:23:32.570 --> 00:23:36.120 align:middle line:84%
>>PARTI: So he was kind of
living his life through me.

00:23:36.120 --> 00:23:36.920 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:23:36.920 --> 00:23:39.680 align:middle line:84%
>>PARTI: Pushing me
harder and harder.

00:23:39.680 --> 00:23:43.700 align:middle line:84%
And actually, in my 10th
grade, I got into bad company,

00:23:43.700 --> 00:23:48.290 align:middle line:84%
I was smoking and drinking
and I flunked my 10th grade.

00:23:48.290 --> 00:23:50.790 align:middle line:90%
But he was very strict.

00:23:50.790 --> 00:23:52.280 align:middle line:90%
He beat me up.

00:23:52.280 --> 00:23:53.870 align:middle line:84%
I was abused by
today's standard,

00:23:53.870 --> 00:23:55.970 align:middle line:84%
but even by that standard,
with a baseball--

00:23:55.970 --> 00:24:00.140 align:middle line:84%
it was a cricket bat, but
I'll call it a baseball bat.

00:24:00.140 --> 00:24:02.060 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: He'd hit you
with a baseball bat.

00:24:02.060 --> 00:24:04.070 align:middle line:84%
>>PARTI: And my mother
used to protect me.

00:24:04.070 --> 00:24:05.720 align:middle line:90%
She would come in between.

00:24:05.720 --> 00:24:08.020 align:middle line:84%
But he dragged my
mother out of the room.

00:24:08.020 --> 00:24:09.850 align:middle line:84%
It's still very
vivid in my mind.

00:24:09.850 --> 00:24:11.080 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Of course.

00:24:11.080 --> 00:24:13.740 align:middle line:84%
And so he actually
had pushed you

00:24:13.740 --> 00:24:18.550 align:middle line:84%
to the point where you really
had to focus in your studies.

00:24:18.550 --> 00:24:19.350 align:middle line:90%
>>PARTI: Yeah.

00:24:19.350 --> 00:24:21.630 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And
ultimately you ended up,

00:24:21.630 --> 00:24:26.069 align:middle line:84%
as just a very small
percentage of young people,

00:24:26.069 --> 00:24:27.610 align:middle line:84%
who make their way
to medical school.

00:24:27.610 --> 00:24:30.690 align:middle line:84%
>>PARTI: It is very hard to get
into medical school in India.

00:24:30.690 --> 00:24:33.980 align:middle line:84%
Only one in 100,000 or one
in 200,000 get selected,

00:24:33.980 --> 00:24:36.829 align:middle line:84%
and I got selected in
three medical schools.

00:24:36.829 --> 00:24:37.870 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: That's amazing.

00:24:37.870 --> 00:24:41.320 align:middle line:84%
And that was your dad's
crowning achievement.

00:24:41.320 --> 00:24:42.120 align:middle line:90%
>>PARTI: It was.

00:24:42.120 --> 00:24:47.410 align:middle line:84%
He was so proud of me that
I got into medical school.

00:24:47.410 --> 00:24:49.530 align:middle line:90%
He felt that I had made it.

00:24:49.530 --> 00:24:52.110 align:middle line:84%
And that same thing
showed up in me.

00:24:52.110 --> 00:24:54.600 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So now
here's dad, and you're

00:24:54.600 --> 00:24:58.050 align:middle line:84%
standing in this place that you
do not want to go further into,

00:24:58.050 --> 00:24:59.630 align:middle line:90%
the bad place.

00:24:59.630 --> 00:25:05.010 align:middle line:84%
And your father is showing up
and he has this aura of love.

00:25:05.010 --> 00:25:08.850 align:middle line:84%
>>PARTI: Exactly, and he
was looking much younger.

00:25:08.850 --> 00:25:13.380 align:middle line:84%
And that's when I felt
that he really loved me

00:25:13.380 --> 00:25:14.715 align:middle line:90%
but he could not express.

00:25:14.715 --> 00:25:18.260 align:middle line:90%


00:25:18.260 --> 00:25:22.160 align:middle line:84%
He wanted me to be educated to
get ahead in live so he doesn't

00:25:22.160 --> 00:25:24.260 align:middle line:84%
have to suffer what
he suffered through,

00:25:24.260 --> 00:25:30.200 align:middle line:84%
because my grandfather always
used to put my father down.

00:25:30.200 --> 00:25:31.730 align:middle line:84%
There were four
brothers, my father

00:25:31.730 --> 00:25:35.810 align:middle line:84%
was the eldest, could not
become what he wanted to become.

00:25:35.810 --> 00:25:41.120 align:middle line:84%
So like a generational
thing, my father

00:25:41.120 --> 00:25:44.500 align:middle line:84%
was abused by his father,
my grandfather was also by--

00:25:44.500 --> 00:25:47.872 align:middle line:84%
it was a whole generational
trauma which was continuing.

00:25:47.872 --> 00:25:50.330 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Which is interesting,
because a lot of times when

00:25:50.330 --> 00:25:53.330 align:middle line:84%
we see the reflections
in the news of India,

00:25:53.330 --> 00:25:55.670 align:middle line:84%
and about the spousal
abuse that occurs

00:25:55.670 --> 00:26:00.120 align:middle line:84%
and such, you stop and
think about it from now

00:26:00.120 --> 00:26:02.600 align:middle line:84%
your dad and your
grandfather's perspective,

00:26:02.600 --> 00:26:06.050 align:middle line:84%
where their own fathers
rode them so hard,

00:26:06.050 --> 00:26:08.180 align:middle line:84%
the scars that it
leaves emotionally.

00:26:08.180 --> 00:26:11.210 align:middle line:84%
And I would think that
it would leave also,

00:26:11.210 --> 00:26:13.820 align:middle line:84%
you'd have to cut off from
your sense of empathy.

00:26:13.820 --> 00:26:14.660 align:middle line:90%
>>PARTI: Exactly.

00:26:14.660 --> 00:26:18.710 align:middle line:84%
And we'll talk later, because
I was becoming my father,

00:26:18.710 --> 00:26:20.440 align:middle line:90%
my marriage broke down too.

00:26:20.440 --> 00:26:22.040 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Well, and even more.

00:26:22.040 --> 00:26:24.167 align:middle line:90%
Now you're here, and--

00:26:24.167 --> 00:26:26.000 align:middle line:84%
well, let's go through
the experience there.

00:26:26.000 --> 00:26:28.333 align:middle line:84%
Then we'll come back to what
was happening prior to that

00:26:28.333 --> 00:26:29.420 align:middle line:90%
with your own son.

00:26:29.420 --> 00:26:31.790 align:middle line:84%
So let's go through everything
that your dad started

00:26:31.790 --> 00:26:33.500 align:middle line:90%
showing you.

00:26:33.500 --> 00:26:36.020 align:middle line:84%
Including these
incredible past lives.

00:26:36.020 --> 00:26:36.870 align:middle line:90%
That was amazing.

00:26:36.870 --> 00:26:41.240 align:middle line:84%
>>PARTI: So dad took me towards
from the realm to a tunnel.

00:26:41.240 --> 00:26:46.510 align:middle line:84%
And in the tunnel I
witnessed my two past lives.

00:26:46.510 --> 00:26:48.130 align:middle line:10%
One of the past
lives I witnessed

00:26:48.130 --> 00:26:56.770 align:middle line:10%
was that I was a farmer in
Afghanistan, opium farmer,

00:26:56.770 --> 00:27:01.030 align:middle line:10%
and I was sipping the sap
and gradually I became

00:27:01.030 --> 00:27:02.970 align:middle line:10%
addicted to the opium sap.

00:27:02.970 --> 00:27:03.770 align:middle line:10%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:27:03.770 --> 00:27:06.940 align:middle line:10%
>>PARTI: And that manifested
in this life as tendency

00:27:06.940 --> 00:27:10.630 align:middle line:10%
to getting addicted
to the pain medicines.

00:27:10.630 --> 00:27:13.300 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Right, you had a
propensity toward addiction.

00:27:13.300 --> 00:27:17.930 align:middle line:84%
And in that life,
the people around you

00:27:17.930 --> 00:27:20.590 align:middle line:84%
that were working with
you in that business

00:27:20.590 --> 00:27:22.030 align:middle line:90%
started taking advantage of you.

00:27:22.030 --> 00:27:23.897 align:middle line:84%
You knew they were
taking advantage of you,

00:27:23.897 --> 00:27:24.730 align:middle line:90%
but you didn't care.

00:27:24.730 --> 00:27:26.500 align:middle line:84%
You were just waiting
for the next fix.

00:27:26.500 --> 00:27:29.785 align:middle line:84%
And it was under the
guise of quality testing.

00:27:29.785 --> 00:27:31.800 align:middle line:90%
>>PARTI: Quality testing, yeah.

00:27:31.800 --> 00:27:33.227 align:middle line:90%
Yeah, that's so true.

00:27:33.227 --> 00:27:35.560 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So you were taking--
you were doing the opium,

00:27:35.560 --> 00:27:37.750 align:middle line:84%
I guess, probably
if you were awake

00:27:37.750 --> 00:27:40.440 align:middle line:84%
you were probably under
the influence of opium.

00:27:40.440 --> 00:27:41.240 align:middle line:90%
>>PARTI: Yeah.

00:27:41.240 --> 00:27:43.156 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And so your
life kind of fell apart.

00:27:43.156 --> 00:27:44.590 align:middle line:90%
Everybody took advantage of you.

00:27:44.590 --> 00:27:45.747 align:middle line:90%
It wasn't a good life.

00:27:45.747 --> 00:27:47.080 align:middle line:90%
>>PARTI: It was not a good life.

00:27:47.080 --> 00:27:50.540 align:middle line:84%
You know, these drugs
are very powerful.

00:27:50.540 --> 00:27:53.417 align:middle line:84%
Like doctors need to be
careful before prescribing.

00:27:53.417 --> 00:27:55.750 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: The opiate-- we'll
talk about that in a little

00:27:55.750 --> 00:27:56.740 align:middle line:90%
bit, too--

00:27:56.740 --> 00:28:01.180 align:middle line:84%
the opiate epidemic
in this country alone.

00:28:01.180 --> 00:28:06.220 align:middle line:84%
>>PARTI: Some places, we
consume 10 times more narcotics

00:28:06.220 --> 00:28:09.360 align:middle line:84%
than any other developed
country in the world.

00:28:09.360 --> 00:28:11.182 align:middle line:90%
Per person, per population.

00:28:11.182 --> 00:28:12.640 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Yes, and
I think I read--

00:28:12.640 --> 00:28:15.910 align:middle line:84%
I was reading in The Week
magazine a couple of days

00:28:15.910 --> 00:28:22.420 align:middle line:84%
ago, that it's the equivalent
of if a Boeing 737 crashed

00:28:22.420 --> 00:28:26.650 align:middle line:84%
and killed every single person
on board every single day.

00:28:26.650 --> 00:28:28.070 align:middle line:90%
In the US alone.

00:28:28.070 --> 00:28:29.650 align:middle line:84%
That's how many
people are dying,

00:28:29.650 --> 00:28:32.560 align:middle line:84%
and that's expected
to go up significantly

00:28:32.560 --> 00:28:33.760 align:middle line:90%
in the next couple of years.

00:28:33.760 --> 00:28:35.860 align:middle line:84%
>>PARTI: It is, because they
take more drugs with it.

00:28:35.860 --> 00:28:37.193 align:middle line:90%
It's not just opiates they take.

00:28:37.193 --> 00:28:41.590 align:middle line:84%
They take alcohol with it,
which is also a depressant.

00:28:41.590 --> 00:28:43.960 align:middle line:90%
So this mixture is very deadly.

00:28:43.960 --> 00:28:48.760 align:middle line:84%
And nowadays, like heroin,
they are spiking with fentanyl.

00:28:48.760 --> 00:28:50.770 align:middle line:84%
And fentanyl is
actually an anesthetic

00:28:50.770 --> 00:28:53.950 align:middle line:84%
which is 100 times more
potent than morphine.

00:28:53.950 --> 00:28:55.540 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Oh my god.

00:28:55.540 --> 00:28:57.520 align:middle line:84%
>>PARTI: Drugs are
being prescribed more,

00:28:57.520 --> 00:29:01.830 align:middle line:84%
but the quantity of
opium is also increasing.

00:29:01.830 --> 00:29:03.640 align:middle line:84%
That's when more
people are dying.

00:29:03.640 --> 00:29:07.937 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Well, and a lot of it
is black market and repurposed

00:29:07.937 --> 00:29:08.770 align:middle line:90%
on the black market.

00:29:08.770 --> 00:29:10.840 align:middle line:90%
>>PARTI: Exactly.

00:29:10.840 --> 00:29:13.430 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Do you know how many
people that are dying of this

00:29:13.430 --> 00:29:18.310 align:middle line:84%
are doing it via prescription
drugs versus black market

00:29:18.310 --> 00:29:19.615 align:middle line:90%
use of the drugs?

00:29:19.615 --> 00:29:21.490 align:middle line:84%
>>PARTI: I don't know,
but prescription drugs

00:29:21.490 --> 00:29:24.500 align:middle line:84%
is much, much more than
the black market nowadays.

00:29:24.500 --> 00:29:25.300 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:29:25.300 --> 00:29:28.300 align:middle line:84%
>>PARTI: Because there
is not that much control.

00:29:28.300 --> 00:29:30.220 align:middle line:84%
The controls are
coming right now.

00:29:30.220 --> 00:29:33.910 align:middle line:84%
I used to have patients who
used to go doctor shopping.

00:29:33.910 --> 00:29:36.250 align:middle line:84%
They used to go from one
doctor to another doctor

00:29:36.250 --> 00:29:39.250 align:middle line:84%
to another doctor and get
prescription from every one,

00:29:39.250 --> 00:29:43.295 align:middle line:84%
and then sell them or
use them themselves.

00:29:43.295 --> 00:29:44.920 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: I just find
this interesting.

00:29:44.920 --> 00:29:47.420 align:middle line:84%
I mean, like that
article was stating,

00:29:47.420 --> 00:29:49.690 align:middle line:84%
we would be in
absolute panic alarm

00:29:49.690 --> 00:29:54.040 align:middle line:84%
if we had a Boeing 737 crashing
on our soil every single day,

00:29:54.040 --> 00:29:56.260 align:middle line:84%
killing all the
occupants, and yet

00:29:56.260 --> 00:29:59.350 align:middle line:84%
it's just now starting to really
get any serious attention.

00:29:59.350 --> 00:30:00.825 align:middle line:84%
And they're still
being prescribed.

00:30:00.825 --> 00:30:01.625 align:middle line:90%
>>PARTI: Yes.

00:30:01.625 --> 00:30:04.960 align:middle line:84%
They're being prescribed
right and left.

00:30:04.960 --> 00:30:09.120 align:middle line:84%
There's big pharma, you know,
less time with the patients,

00:30:09.120 --> 00:30:10.300 align:middle line:90%
there's so many factors.

00:30:10.300 --> 00:30:11.100 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:30:11.100 --> 00:30:11.900 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:30:11.900 --> 00:30:13.950 align:middle line:84%
So you're with your
father now, and he's

00:30:13.950 --> 00:30:16.140 align:middle line:84%
taken you into this life,
where you understood,

00:30:16.140 --> 00:30:19.350 align:middle line:84%
because you had also
taken some opioids.

00:30:19.350 --> 00:30:20.150 align:middle line:90%
>>PARTI: Yeah.

00:30:20.150 --> 00:30:21.180 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: You were
taking them as well,

00:30:21.180 --> 00:30:24.180 align:middle line:84%
so you knew the disconnection,
what it was doing in this life.

00:30:24.180 --> 00:30:25.520 align:middle line:90%
>>PARTI: Exactly.

00:30:25.520 --> 00:30:28.690 align:middle line:84%
I was emotionally becoming
unavailable to my family.

00:30:28.690 --> 00:30:29.490 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:30:29.490 --> 00:30:30.930 align:middle line:84%
>>PARTI: And then
the stress used

00:30:30.930 --> 00:30:33.390 align:middle line:84%
to be so much when
I used to come home.

00:30:33.390 --> 00:30:37.790 align:middle line:84%
I did not take any alcohol the
day I was on call, because I

00:30:37.790 --> 00:30:39.690 align:middle line:84%
could injure somebody
or my breath,

00:30:39.690 --> 00:30:43.760 align:middle line:84%
somebody might smell it, but
the days I was not on call,

00:30:43.760 --> 00:30:46.652 align:middle line:84%
it was routine for me to take
two or three glasses of scotch.

00:30:46.652 --> 00:30:48.360 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And you were
doing these drugs.

00:30:48.360 --> 00:30:49.500 align:middle line:90%
>>PARTI: And drugs.

00:30:49.500 --> 00:30:52.434 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So you were
an addict and you

00:30:52.434 --> 00:30:54.600 align:middle line:84%
had to go through that
withdrawal phase, which we'll

00:30:54.600 --> 00:30:57.520 align:middle line:84%
talk about later, because
that goes into the other part

00:30:57.520 --> 00:30:58.320 align:middle line:90%
of your story.

00:30:58.320 --> 00:30:59.120 align:middle line:90%
>>PARTI: Yeah.

00:30:59.120 --> 00:31:02.040 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: But let's go to
the second life, because that

00:31:02.040 --> 00:31:04.140 align:middle line:84%
was even more painful
for you to look at.

00:31:04.140 --> 00:31:07.860 align:middle line:84%
>>PARTI: In my second life I
had a scar from here to here,

00:31:07.860 --> 00:31:10.800 align:middle line:84%
and I had three wrist surgeries
prior to all this happening

00:31:10.800 --> 00:31:13.470 align:middle line:84%
because I had torn a
ligament in my wrist.

00:31:13.470 --> 00:31:16.080 align:middle line:84%
And it became a
chronic pain it's

00:31:16.080 --> 00:31:19.110 align:middle line:84%
known as RSD, Reflex
Sympathetic Dystrophy.

00:31:19.110 --> 00:31:21.980 align:middle line:84%
The pain causes
constriction of the vessel,

00:31:21.980 --> 00:31:25.440 align:middle line:84%
and then constriction
causes more pain.

00:31:25.440 --> 00:31:28.410 align:middle line:84%
There's less blood so the
hands become cold and clammy.

00:31:28.410 --> 00:31:30.380 align:middle line:84%
And that's what I
was suffering from.

00:31:30.380 --> 00:31:33.750 align:middle line:84%
I couldn't walk for six months
one time after one surgery.

00:31:33.750 --> 00:31:37.390 align:middle line:84%
And in the second
life which I saw,

00:31:37.390 --> 00:31:39.540 align:middle line:84%
I was a prince in
a medieval Europe.

00:31:39.540 --> 00:31:43.150 align:middle line:84%
I still remember the
fort in front of me.

00:31:43.150 --> 00:31:45.460 align:middle line:90%
I was whipping poor farmers.

00:31:45.460 --> 00:31:47.255 align:middle line:84%
They were in the
brown type of clothes.

00:31:47.255 --> 00:31:48.630 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: You were
whipping them.

00:31:48.630 --> 00:31:49.755 align:middle line:90%
>>PARTI: Yeah, with a whip.

00:31:49.755 --> 00:31:52.336 align:middle line:84%
And my soldiers were
also whipping them.

00:31:52.336 --> 00:31:57.890 align:middle line:84%
And I asked forgiveness from
them for what I had done.

00:31:57.890 --> 00:32:00.780 align:middle line:84%
In this life I asked, in
my near-death experience,

00:32:00.780 --> 00:32:02.320 align:middle line:90%
forgiveness from them.

00:32:02.320 --> 00:32:03.780 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: But why--
what could you

00:32:03.780 --> 00:32:07.170 align:middle line:84%
feel inside yourself that
would perpetuate that kind

00:32:07.170 --> 00:32:09.480 align:middle line:90%
of careless kind of cruelty?

00:32:09.480 --> 00:32:11.220 align:middle line:84%
They weren't doing
anything wrong.

00:32:11.220 --> 00:32:13.030 align:middle line:90%
>>PARTI: Yeah.

00:32:13.030 --> 00:32:17.380 align:middle line:84%
I mean, that was you like
being a lord, being a count,

00:32:17.380 --> 00:32:22.260 align:middle line:84%
being a prince, being cool
was kind of in the blood.

00:32:22.260 --> 00:32:27.390 align:middle line:84%
To get more money, to get more
harvest, to get more things.

00:32:27.390 --> 00:32:29.830 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Like whipping a
horse in the field, even.

00:32:29.830 --> 00:32:30.630 align:middle line:90%
>>PARTI: Yeah.

00:32:30.630 --> 00:32:32.234 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: But humans as well.

00:32:32.234 --> 00:32:33.900 align:middle line:84%
>>PARTI: But in my
near-death experience

00:32:33.900 --> 00:32:37.860 align:middle line:84%
I realized that it was wrong,
so I asked forgiveness,

00:32:37.860 --> 00:32:39.390 align:middle line:90%
and they forgave me.

00:32:39.390 --> 00:32:42.840 align:middle line:84%
The most remarkable thing
was, after my near death

00:32:42.840 --> 00:32:46.180 align:middle line:84%
experience I never suffered
from pain in my right hand.

00:32:46.180 --> 00:32:47.460 align:middle line:90%
It's totally normal.

00:32:47.460 --> 00:32:48.630 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: It was released.

00:32:48.630 --> 00:32:49.740 align:middle line:90%
>>PARTI: It was released.

00:32:49.740 --> 00:32:52.110 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And you met
with one of the people

00:32:52.110 --> 00:32:55.830 align:middle line:90%
there that you had whipped.

00:32:55.830 --> 00:32:57.700 align:middle line:84%
One of the people
spoke to you, right?

00:32:57.700 --> 00:32:58.500 align:middle line:90%
>>PARTI: Yeah.

00:32:58.500 --> 00:33:01.530 align:middle line:84%
And they forgive
me, essentially.

00:33:01.530 --> 00:33:05.700 align:middle line:84%
It was wrong of me
to be whipping them

00:33:05.700 --> 00:33:09.600 align:middle line:84%
for basically no reason,
to show my authority.

00:33:09.600 --> 00:33:12.360 align:middle line:84%
That was the main thing,
to show my authority.

00:33:12.360 --> 00:33:15.870 align:middle line:84%
And after they forgave
me, I have never

00:33:15.870 --> 00:33:17.790 align:middle line:90%
suffered from pain again.

00:33:17.790 --> 00:33:20.190 align:middle line:84%
I used to have so
much of pain, and I've

00:33:20.190 --> 00:33:24.780 align:middle line:84%
been working normally with
it, using it, lifting weights,

00:33:24.780 --> 00:33:25.959 align:middle line:90%
everything normal.

00:33:25.959 --> 00:33:27.000 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: That's amazing.

00:33:27.000 --> 00:33:28.200 align:middle line:90%
>>PARTI: That is amazing.

00:33:28.200 --> 00:33:31.530 align:middle line:84%
That's why-- this also I
discussed with Dr. Moody,

00:33:31.530 --> 00:33:33.610 align:middle line:90%
as I mentioned before--

00:33:33.610 --> 00:33:36.180 align:middle line:84%
there is no time and
space in the other realm,

00:33:36.180 --> 00:33:39.450 align:middle line:90%
so one can go back and--

00:33:39.450 --> 00:33:40.560 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Instantly heal.

00:33:40.560 --> 00:33:41.726 align:middle line:90%
>>PARTI: And instantly heal.

00:33:41.726 --> 00:33:45.240 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So now you've
witnessed these past lives,

00:33:45.240 --> 00:33:47.020 align:middle line:84%
and you're back
with your father.

00:33:47.020 --> 00:33:49.740 align:middle line:84%
And where did he
take you from there?

00:33:49.740 --> 00:33:51.780 align:middle line:84%
>>PARTI: Then he kind
of left me after that.

00:33:51.780 --> 00:33:53.640 align:middle line:90%
He kind of vanished.

00:33:53.640 --> 00:33:57.730 align:middle line:84%
And on the other
side of the tunnel,

00:33:57.730 --> 00:33:59.910 align:middle line:84%
I was greeted by
two angelic beings.

00:33:59.910 --> 00:34:00.710 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:34:00.710 --> 00:34:01.918 align:middle line:90%
>>PARTI: Michael and Raphael.

00:34:01.918 --> 00:34:03.810 align:middle line:84%
I did not know their
names that well.

00:34:03.810 --> 00:34:06.780 align:middle line:84%
I knew they were angels,
because I was born and raised

00:34:06.780 --> 00:34:08.100 align:middle line:90%
in a Hindu faith.

00:34:08.100 --> 00:34:08.900 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:34:08.900 --> 00:34:09.840 align:middle line:84%
>>PARTI: And these
were Christian.

00:34:09.840 --> 00:34:10.889 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And you
were waiting-- you

00:34:10.889 --> 00:34:12.840 align:middle line:84%
would have thought that
some Hindu-- your wife later

00:34:12.840 --> 00:34:13.800 align:middle line:90%
said, what do you mean?

00:34:13.800 --> 00:34:15.100 align:middle line:90%
Where were the Hindu gods?

00:34:15.100 --> 00:34:18.989 align:middle line:84%
>>PARTI: Yes, that's
what I was wondering too.

00:34:18.989 --> 00:34:20.699 align:middle line:90%
But then it made sense.

00:34:20.699 --> 00:34:24.420 align:middle line:84%
Michael is the angel of
strength and power and truth,

00:34:24.420 --> 00:34:28.370 align:middle line:84%
and Raphael is the angel of
healers, and I needed healing

00:34:28.370 --> 00:34:31.080 align:middle line:90%
and I'm a healer as a doctor.

00:34:31.080 --> 00:34:32.741 align:middle line:90%
So it made total sense.

00:34:32.741 --> 00:34:34.199 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So they
came and what did

00:34:34.199 --> 00:34:35.400 align:middle line:84%
they show-- they
showed you things

00:34:35.400 --> 00:34:36.525 align:middle line:90%
and shared things with you.

00:34:36.525 --> 00:34:38.000 align:middle line:84%
>>PARTI: They shared
with me that--

00:34:38.000 --> 00:34:39.620 align:middle line:90%
they took me towards a meadow.

00:34:39.620 --> 00:34:42.560 align:middle line:90%


00:34:42.560 --> 00:34:43.530 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: A meadow?

00:34:43.530 --> 00:34:47.389 align:middle line:84%
>>PARTI: It was pure of a
meadow, with a river there,

00:34:47.389 --> 00:34:51.820 align:middle line:84%
and I could distinctly
hear the sound om.

00:34:51.820 --> 00:34:56.800 align:middle line:90%
And it was very nice fragrance.

00:34:56.800 --> 00:34:58.610 align:middle line:84%
And they said my life
would be changing.

00:34:58.610 --> 00:35:02.180 align:middle line:90%


00:35:02.180 --> 00:35:04.070 align:middle line:84%
My job was going to
be to serve people.

00:35:04.070 --> 00:35:07.500 align:middle line:90%


00:35:07.500 --> 00:35:11.181 align:middle line:84%
And then they took
me to a light.

00:35:11.181 --> 00:35:17.000 align:middle line:84%
The light was like a thousand
suns at the same time,

00:35:17.000 --> 00:35:20.070 align:middle line:90%
but it was not hurting.

00:35:20.070 --> 00:35:22.210 align:middle line:90%
And I was told the same thing.

00:35:22.210 --> 00:35:24.860 align:middle line:90%


00:35:24.860 --> 00:35:28.525 align:middle line:84%
Your work is not done and
your life will be different.

00:35:28.525 --> 00:35:32.140 align:middle line:84%
And from there, I suddenly
woke up in the recovery room

00:35:32.140 --> 00:35:33.010 align:middle line:90%
with a jolt.

00:35:33.010 --> 00:35:33.970 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: And they were--

00:35:33.970 --> 00:35:35.290 align:middle line:84%
there was a little
panic around that.

00:35:35.290 --> 00:35:37.350 align:middle line:84%
They were like, oh my
god, that was a tough one.

00:35:37.350 --> 00:35:37.840 align:middle line:90%
>>PARTI: Yeah.

00:35:37.840 --> 00:35:39.631 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Your body
had been through a lot.

00:35:39.631 --> 00:35:40.720 align:middle line:90%
>>PARTI: Through a lot.

00:35:40.720 --> 00:35:43.095 align:middle line:84%
And the first thing was, when
I was in the recovery room,

00:35:43.095 --> 00:35:45.050 align:middle line:90%
I was so excited.

00:35:45.050 --> 00:35:47.680 align:middle line:84%
I was in pain, but I
was telling the nurse

00:35:47.680 --> 00:35:51.250 align:middle line:84%
what happened while she
was applying the monitors.

00:35:51.250 --> 00:35:53.830 align:middle line:84%
And she believed
it because she had

00:35:53.830 --> 00:35:56.790 align:middle line:90%
heard similar things before.

00:35:56.790 --> 00:36:00.460 align:middle line:84%
When the anaesthesiologist came
to check on me, I told him,

00:36:00.460 --> 00:36:03.790 align:middle line:84%
but he was skeptical, and
I told him the joke also.

00:36:03.790 --> 00:36:07.150 align:middle line:84%
And he said maybe you
were light on anesthesia.

00:36:07.150 --> 00:36:09.610 align:middle line:84%
But then it was, I
checked the records,

00:36:09.610 --> 00:36:14.900 align:middle line:84%
I was not light on
anaesthesia, and I had no pain.

00:36:14.900 --> 00:36:18.130 align:middle line:84%
If it was light in anesthesia
I would've been in pain.

00:36:18.130 --> 00:36:19.360 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes .

00:36:19.360 --> 00:36:23.350 align:middle line:84%
So this was a real-- this
presented a quandary for you,

00:36:23.350 --> 00:36:25.630 align:middle line:84%
because you hadn't
believed anyone before,

00:36:25.630 --> 00:36:28.390 align:middle line:84%
and you thought how am I
going to translate any of this

00:36:28.390 --> 00:36:29.710 align:middle line:90%
to the people in my life?

00:36:29.710 --> 00:36:31.390 align:middle line:90%
No one will believe me.

00:36:31.390 --> 00:36:32.770 align:middle line:84%
And no less, to
know that you had

00:36:32.770 --> 00:36:35.440 align:middle line:84%
to give up your job,
meaning you were probably

00:36:35.440 --> 00:36:38.110 align:middle line:84%
going to have to give
up a lot of your stuff,

00:36:38.110 --> 00:36:41.620 align:middle line:84%
and you were going to have to
literally recreate yourself out

00:36:41.620 --> 00:36:44.240 align:middle line:84%
of whole cloth and didn't
even know how to do that.

00:36:44.240 --> 00:36:45.040 align:middle line:90%
>>PARTI: Yeah.

00:36:45.040 --> 00:36:46.250 align:middle line:90%
That is so true.

00:36:46.250 --> 00:36:49.330 align:middle line:90%
But I've transformed so much.

00:36:49.330 --> 00:36:51.720 align:middle line:84%
That was for me and my
wife, especially my wife

00:36:51.720 --> 00:36:55.049 align:middle line:84%
and near ones that
something really did happen.

00:36:55.049 --> 00:36:56.340 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Oh, yeah, absolutely.

00:36:56.340 --> 00:36:58.090 align:middle line:84%
Well, first you had
to deal with your wife

00:36:58.090 --> 00:37:00.730 align:middle line:84%
and tell her what
happened, what you saw,

00:37:00.730 --> 00:37:02.560 align:middle line:84%
and that your life
was going to change.

00:37:02.560 --> 00:37:05.050 align:middle line:84%
And then the whole
thing about finding

00:37:05.050 --> 00:37:08.570 align:middle line:84%
classically Christian archangels
rather than Hindu gods.

00:37:08.570 --> 00:37:10.520 align:middle line:84%
>>PARTI: So we had a
whole conversation.

00:37:10.520 --> 00:37:11.320 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:37:11.320 --> 00:37:14.650 align:middle line:84%
>>PARTI: My wife
believed me when she

00:37:14.650 --> 00:37:16.600 align:middle line:90%
saw I was a different person.

00:37:16.600 --> 00:37:19.645 align:middle line:84%
My daughter started
believing me, but my sons--

00:37:19.645 --> 00:37:23.000 align:middle line:84%
I have two sons and one
daughter-- were skeptical.

00:37:23.000 --> 00:37:25.010 align:middle line:90%
They were kind of agnostic.

00:37:25.010 --> 00:37:26.650 align:middle line:90%
But they liked the new dad.

00:37:26.650 --> 00:37:27.470 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: They
liked the new dad.

00:37:27.470 --> 00:37:29.636 align:middle line:84%
But there was still a little
bit of time in between,

00:37:29.636 --> 00:37:33.910 align:middle line:84%
because you were riding your
son as hard, really, in a way--

00:37:33.910 --> 00:37:36.670 align:middle line:84%
not beating him-- but as
far as your expectations

00:37:36.670 --> 00:37:39.790 align:middle line:84%
for him to become a doctor,
as your father was you.

00:37:39.790 --> 00:37:41.170 align:middle line:90%
>>PARTI: Exactly.

00:37:41.170 --> 00:37:44.080 align:middle line:84%
My father was showing
up through me.

00:37:44.080 --> 00:37:46.780 align:middle line:84%
I was not physically
abusive to him,

00:37:46.780 --> 00:37:50.420 align:middle line:84%
but I was equally emotionally
and verbally abusive to him.

00:37:50.420 --> 00:37:51.220 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:37:51.220 --> 00:37:53.790 align:middle line:84%
>>PARTI: I pushed him
to go to medical school,

00:37:53.790 --> 00:37:57.110 align:middle line:84%
and if he flunked I used
to get so mad at him.

00:37:57.110 --> 00:37:58.880 align:middle line:90%
Why can't you do it?

00:37:58.880 --> 00:37:59.830 align:middle line:90%
You have the brains.

00:37:59.830 --> 00:38:00.430 align:middle line:90%
You can do it.

00:38:00.430 --> 00:38:02.013 align:middle line:84%
You're spending all
your time on Xbox.

00:38:02.013 --> 00:38:03.430 align:middle line:90%
This, that.

00:38:03.430 --> 00:38:07.090 align:middle line:84%
I had thrown [INAUDIBLE]
Xbox on the floor.

00:38:07.090 --> 00:38:09.467 align:middle line:84%
And he wanted to
go in computers.

00:38:09.467 --> 00:38:11.050 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Right,
that's what he loved.

00:38:11.050 --> 00:38:12.250 align:middle line:90%
>>PARTI: He loved that.

00:38:12.250 --> 00:38:16.450 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So your son and
you had a fairly emotionally

00:38:16.450 --> 00:38:18.860 align:middle line:84%
distant kind of
relationship as a result.

00:38:18.860 --> 00:38:22.990 align:middle line:84%
And when you came
back, let's kind of

00:38:22.990 --> 00:38:24.880 align:middle line:84%
go through a little
bit chronologically.

00:38:24.880 --> 00:38:28.420 align:middle line:84%
First of all, you had to
go through withdrawals

00:38:28.420 --> 00:38:31.180 align:middle line:84%
from all of the drugs
that you had been on.

00:38:31.180 --> 00:38:33.010 align:middle line:84%
>>PARTI: But it was
not that difficult.

00:38:33.010 --> 00:38:34.690 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Because you'd been
through this experience.

00:38:34.690 --> 00:38:35.570 align:middle line:84%
>>PARTI: Through
this experience.

00:38:35.570 --> 00:38:36.440 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:38:36.440 --> 00:38:37.240 align:middle line:90%
>>PARTI: Yeah.

00:38:37.240 --> 00:38:39.615 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And another thing
you did that was interesting,

00:38:39.615 --> 00:38:41.840 align:middle line:84%
to start making your
life more manageable

00:38:41.840 --> 00:38:44.350 align:middle line:84%
so you could even imagine
how you could continue

00:38:44.350 --> 00:38:48.520 align:middle line:84%
to afford to do what you do
without your job, was you

00:38:48.520 --> 00:38:50.020 align:middle line:90%
swapped houses.

00:38:50.020 --> 00:38:52.240 align:middle line:90%
>>PARTI: Yeah.

00:38:52.240 --> 00:38:58.360 align:middle line:84%
The way the universe works, my
house was almost a $3 million

00:38:58.360 --> 00:39:01.089 align:middle line:84%
house, which is a big
house in Bakersfield.

00:39:01.089 --> 00:39:02.380 align:middle line:90%
It's hard to sell those houses.

00:39:02.380 --> 00:39:03.580 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah, yeah.

00:39:03.580 --> 00:39:05.620 align:middle line:84%
>>PARTI: And there
was a plastic surgeon

00:39:05.620 --> 00:39:09.670 align:middle line:84%
who had a smaller house
from his residency days.

00:39:09.670 --> 00:39:14.080 align:middle line:84%
And I wanted to downsize my
lifestyle and everything,

00:39:14.080 --> 00:39:15.576 align:middle line:90%
and he wanted to upscale.

00:39:15.576 --> 00:39:16.450 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Super size.

00:39:16.450 --> 00:39:18.010 align:middle line:90%
>>PARTI: Super size it.

00:39:18.010 --> 00:39:19.780 align:middle line:84%
So we literally
exchanged our houses.

00:39:19.780 --> 00:39:22.260 align:middle line:84%
There was no real
estate agent involved.

00:39:22.260 --> 00:39:27.140 align:middle line:84%
We just went to a escrow company
and we did the paperwork.

00:39:27.140 --> 00:39:30.610 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Now after that
happened, how did your wife

00:39:30.610 --> 00:39:32.230 align:middle line:84%
feel on the news
that you were going

00:39:32.230 --> 00:39:37.070 align:middle line:84%
to be leaving your job,
which you did, and downsizing

00:39:37.070 --> 00:39:37.870 align:middle line:90%
your life?

00:39:37.870 --> 00:39:39.745 align:middle line:84%
Because she'd gotten
used to all these perks.

00:39:39.745 --> 00:39:41.650 align:middle line:84%
>>PARTI: She was
used to the perks,

00:39:41.650 --> 00:39:45.310 align:middle line:84%
but in the beginning
part, because

00:39:45.310 --> 00:39:48.820 align:middle line:84%
of her marriage and
everything, she supported me.

00:39:48.820 --> 00:39:51.586 align:middle line:84%
And marriage was much,
much better also,

00:39:51.586 --> 00:39:52.960 align:middle line:84%
because I was a
different person.

00:39:52.960 --> 00:39:58.270 align:middle line:84%
I was more sympathetic, I
was more listening to her.

00:39:58.270 --> 00:40:02.290 align:middle line:84%
But then the second part will
come when we reach there.

00:40:02.290 --> 00:40:03.340 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:40:03.340 --> 00:40:06.610 align:middle line:84%
And then your son, finally one
day you were all in the kitchen

00:40:06.610 --> 00:40:10.250 align:middle line:84%
together, and you
finally asked him,

00:40:10.250 --> 00:40:11.950 align:middle line:90%
do you even want to be a doctor?

00:40:11.950 --> 00:40:14.020 align:middle line:84%
>>PARTI: I finally asked
him and he said no.

00:40:14.020 --> 00:40:16.570 align:middle line:84%
And he had just
flunked his exam.

00:40:16.570 --> 00:40:17.370 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:40:17.370 --> 00:40:20.860 align:middle line:84%
>>PARTI: And he was expecting
me to be very angry.

00:40:20.860 --> 00:40:24.220 align:middle line:84%
But I said, no, beta--
beta means "my son"--

00:40:24.220 --> 00:40:26.720 align:middle line:84%
beta, do whatever
you want to do.

00:40:26.720 --> 00:40:29.050 align:middle line:84%
And he said he wants
to go into computers.

00:40:29.050 --> 00:40:31.530 align:middle line:84%
And fast forwarding
to now, he's just

00:40:31.530 --> 00:40:35.070 align:middle line:84%
graduated from computers at
University of San Francisco

00:40:35.070 --> 00:40:37.870 align:middle line:84%
and found his job and his
passion and he's very happy.

00:40:37.870 --> 00:40:38.670 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:40:38.670 --> 00:40:39.390 align:middle line:90%
That's wonderful.

00:40:39.390 --> 00:40:41.598 align:middle line:84%
>>PARTI: He's not making
the money he would have made

00:40:41.598 --> 00:40:42.417 align:middle line:90%
as a doctor, but--

00:40:42.417 --> 00:40:43.750 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: But he loves his life.

00:40:43.750 --> 00:40:45.640 align:middle line:84%
>>PARTI: He loves his
life and he's happy.

00:40:45.640 --> 00:40:47.100 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah, OK.

00:40:47.100 --> 00:40:51.390 align:middle line:84%
And so you've informed
everyone, you've

00:40:51.390 --> 00:40:53.400 align:middle line:84%
informed your colleagues
you're leaving,

00:40:53.400 --> 00:40:57.390 align:middle line:84%
and now you start
meditating regularly

00:40:57.390 --> 00:40:58.980 align:middle line:90%
and you start finding your way.

00:40:58.980 --> 00:41:00.570 align:middle line:84%
How am I supposed
to help people.

00:41:00.570 --> 00:41:01.410 align:middle line:90%
>>PARTI: Yeah.

00:41:01.410 --> 00:41:02.820 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And what
started there?

00:41:02.820 --> 00:41:04.957 align:middle line:84%
>>PARTI: And also
I sold my Hummer.

00:41:04.957 --> 00:41:06.540 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: You sold
your Hummer, right.

00:41:06.540 --> 00:41:08.327 align:middle line:84%
>>PARTI: And I bought
a Toyota hybrid.

00:41:08.327 --> 00:41:09.660 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: A Toyota hybrid, yeah.

00:41:09.660 --> 00:41:11.820 align:middle line:84%
>>PARTI: And my lease
of my excess sports car

00:41:11.820 --> 00:41:13.980 align:middle line:90%
expired, I let it go.

00:41:13.980 --> 00:41:16.800 align:middle line:84%
And the car I bought,
the hybrid was--

00:41:16.800 --> 00:41:18.340 align:middle line:84%
I bought it because
I wanted to--

00:41:18.340 --> 00:41:20.490 align:middle line:84%
otherwise I was changing
cars every three years.

00:41:20.490 --> 00:41:21.290 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:41:21.290 --> 00:41:23.010 align:middle line:84%
>>PARTI: But now I
still have that one.

00:41:23.010 --> 00:41:25.440 align:middle line:84%
And I kid with my
friends, my life

00:41:25.440 --> 00:41:27.000 align:middle line:90%
went from Hummer to hybrid.

00:41:27.000 --> 00:41:28.315 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:41:28.315 --> 00:41:29.940 align:middle line:84%
And how did your
friends take all that?

00:41:29.940 --> 00:41:31.731 align:middle line:84%
Did they stay with you,
or did some of them

00:41:31.731 --> 00:41:33.177 align:middle line:90%
say, he's not one of us anymore?

00:41:33.177 --> 00:41:35.010 align:middle line:84%
>>PARTI: I was not one
of them, because when

00:41:35.010 --> 00:41:39.360 align:middle line:84%
I went to the same parties
as I was used to go to,

00:41:39.360 --> 00:41:41.700 align:middle line:84%
all they talked about
was money, stocks,

00:41:41.700 --> 00:41:47.620 align:middle line:84%
and the new rules of everything,
I didn't feel at home.

00:41:47.620 --> 00:41:49.390 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Yeah, I
can understand that.

00:41:49.390 --> 00:41:54.340 align:middle line:84%
So now your wife initially
feels good, but then

00:41:54.340 --> 00:41:56.380 align:middle line:84%
things start changing
in your personal life.

00:41:56.380 --> 00:41:58.690 align:middle line:84%
And let's talk about that
journey of the kind of work

00:41:58.690 --> 00:42:02.060 align:middle line:84%
you started doing, but what
was happening at home as well.

00:42:02.060 --> 00:42:04.990 align:middle line:84%
>>PARTI: At home,
I started going

00:42:04.990 --> 00:42:09.040 align:middle line:84%
to lectures to get the skills
of what I was supposed to learn.

00:42:09.040 --> 00:42:10.190 align:middle line:90%
I learned Ayurveda.

00:42:10.190 --> 00:42:12.950 align:middle line:10%
I trained in meditation
of Deepak Chopra.

00:42:12.950 --> 00:42:16.030 align:middle line:10%
Because the consciousness-based
medicine is based

00:42:16.030 --> 00:42:17.290 align:middle line:10%
on the principle--

00:42:17.290 --> 00:42:21.280 align:middle line:10%
like, actually, Einstein said,
the solution to the problem

00:42:21.280 --> 00:42:24.850 align:middle line:10%
cannot be found at the
level it was created,

00:42:24.850 --> 00:42:26.785 align:middle line:10%
level of consciousness
it was created.

00:42:26.785 --> 00:42:27.585 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:42:27.585 --> 00:42:29.320 align:middle line:84%
>>PARTI: So like
addiction, depression,

00:42:29.320 --> 00:42:31.810 align:middle line:84%
heart diseases which
are stress-related,

00:42:31.810 --> 00:42:34.210 align:middle line:84%
if you elevate your
level of consciousness

00:42:34.210 --> 00:42:37.600 align:middle line:84%
through prayer, meditation,
and service, these are three

00:42:37.600 --> 00:42:42.790 align:middle line:84%
because I tell people, seva
means service and service is

00:42:42.790 --> 00:42:49.480 align:middle line:84%
not as a pity, but as
honoring, giving me an honor

00:42:49.480 --> 00:42:50.290 align:middle line:90%
to serve you.

00:42:50.290 --> 00:42:50.740 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:42:50.740 --> 00:42:51.864 align:middle line:90%
>>PARTI: You see yourself--

00:42:51.864 --> 00:42:53.080 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: It can't be pious.

00:42:53.080 --> 00:42:54.500 align:middle line:90%
>>PARTI: It cannot be pious.

00:42:54.500 --> 00:42:55.300 align:middle line:90%
Exactly

00:42:55.300 --> 00:42:55.630 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:42:55.630 --> 00:42:57.010 align:middle line:90%
>>PARTI: And then meditation.

00:42:57.010 --> 00:43:01.240 align:middle line:84%
I believe meditation is when
God talks to you and prayer

00:43:01.240 --> 00:43:02.640 align:middle line:90%
is when you talk to God.

00:43:02.640 --> 00:43:04.170 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:43:04.170 --> 00:43:06.520 align:middle line:84%
And so this became your
practice, and sometimes

00:43:06.520 --> 00:43:07.460 align:middle line:90%
hours a day.

00:43:07.460 --> 00:43:08.770 align:middle line:84%
>>PARTI: Yeah, this
became a practice.

00:43:08.770 --> 00:43:10.520 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And you were
waiting to be shown

00:43:10.520 --> 00:43:11.930 align:middle line:90%
the way forward for yourself.

00:43:11.930 --> 00:43:13.090 align:middle line:90%
>>PARTI: Yeah.

00:43:13.090 --> 00:43:17.530 align:middle line:84%
And in the meantime I was
going out and I became--

00:43:17.530 --> 00:43:22.010 align:middle line:84%
I did not have this idea, but
my marriage was breaking down.

00:43:22.010 --> 00:43:24.860 align:middle line:84%
And one day about three
years, ago my wife

00:43:24.860 --> 00:43:27.940 align:middle line:84%
finally says, I don't love
you and I have not loved you

00:43:27.940 --> 00:43:30.370 align:middle line:90%
for the last two years.

00:43:30.370 --> 00:43:32.570 align:middle line:90%
It was a shock.

00:43:32.570 --> 00:43:36.040 align:middle line:84%
Literally, I felt like a dagger
was put through my heart.

00:43:36.040 --> 00:43:37.840 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:43:37.840 --> 00:43:40.120 align:middle line:84%
Because she married
one guy and you

00:43:40.120 --> 00:43:41.965 align:middle line:84%
turned into a different
person, for one.

00:43:41.965 --> 00:43:43.570 align:middle line:90%
>>PARTI: And then I found out--

00:43:43.570 --> 00:43:50.315 align:middle line:84%
that's what kid with my wife and
my friends, there are Raj 1.0--

00:43:50.315 --> 00:43:51.190 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Which was--

00:43:51.190 --> 00:43:52.500 align:middle line:84%
>>PARTI: Before
near-death experience.

00:43:52.500 --> 00:43:53.300 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:43:53.300 --> 00:43:55.060 align:middle line:84%
>>PARTI: And then
there's Raj 2.0

00:43:55.060 --> 00:43:57.020 align:middle line:90%
after the near-death experience.

00:43:57.020 --> 00:44:00.170 align:middle line:84%
So I was not the Raj 1.0
which my wife married.

00:44:00.170 --> 00:44:00.970 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:44:00.970 --> 00:44:04.780 align:middle line:84%
>>PARTI: She's married hard
charging, making good money,

00:44:04.780 --> 00:44:08.230 align:middle line:90%
with good position, alpha male.

00:44:08.230 --> 00:44:12.970 align:middle line:84%
And so she became distant
and our marriage broke down.

00:44:12.970 --> 00:44:18.580 align:middle line:84%
Our marriage literally had
a near-death experience.

00:44:18.580 --> 00:44:21.520 align:middle line:84%
From no love, we
filed for divorce,

00:44:21.520 --> 00:44:26.585 align:middle line:84%
and we were one signature
short of divorce.

00:44:26.585 --> 00:44:28.210 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And going
your separate ways.

00:44:28.210 --> 00:44:29.480 align:middle line:84%
>>PARTI: Going
our separate ways.

00:44:29.480 --> 00:44:30.855 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And then
what happened?

00:44:30.855 --> 00:44:33.850 align:middle line:84%
>>PARTI: Then it was
in a universe or magic;

00:44:33.850 --> 00:44:38.145 align:middle line:84%
how strange it works, it
was in December of 2016

00:44:38.145 --> 00:44:41.127 align:middle line:84%
and our 30th anniversary
was just coming up.

00:44:41.127 --> 00:44:43.710 align:middle line:84%
So my wife said, [NON-ENGLISH]
do you want to give it a chance

00:44:43.710 --> 00:44:46.480 align:middle line:90%
and finish 30 years of marriage?

00:44:46.480 --> 00:44:47.310 align:middle line:90%
I said, why not?

00:44:47.310 --> 00:44:50.000 align:middle line:84%
I've lived with you for so
long, had three kids with you,

00:44:50.000 --> 00:44:51.310 align:middle line:90%
let's give it a shot.

00:44:51.310 --> 00:44:56.640 align:middle line:84%
And from there, I
was now Raj 3.0.

00:44:56.640 --> 00:44:59.430 align:middle line:84%
I had started applying
the lessons I had learned

00:44:59.430 --> 00:45:01.290 align:middle line:90%
from near-death experience.

00:45:01.290 --> 00:45:04.680 align:middle line:84%
The biggest lesson was
the power of forgiveness.

00:45:04.680 --> 00:45:08.770 align:middle line:84%
And I became a kinder, and I
started practicing forgiveness,

00:45:08.770 --> 00:45:14.330 align:middle line:84%
that she realized that
she can really love me.

00:45:14.330 --> 00:45:15.700 align:middle line:90%
And it was like a fairy tale.

00:45:15.700 --> 00:45:19.340 align:middle line:84%
Then six weeks later,
on 12th February,

00:45:19.340 --> 00:45:21.740 align:middle line:90%
we burned the divorce papers.

00:45:21.740 --> 00:45:23.470 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: You burned
the divorce papers?

00:45:23.470 --> 00:45:24.270 align:middle line:90%
>>PARTI: Like a--

00:45:24.270 --> 00:45:25.880 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Yeah,
a little bonfire.

00:45:25.880 --> 00:45:27.700 align:middle line:90%
>>PARTI: A bonfire.

00:45:27.700 --> 00:45:29.315 align:middle line:84%
In India, we do
bonfires with mantras,

00:45:29.315 --> 00:45:32.787 align:middle line:84%
so we were let it go,
like, past is past.

00:45:32.787 --> 00:45:34.370 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So what
happened between you

00:45:34.370 --> 00:45:36.320 align:middle line:84%
that allowed you to
feel each other again,

00:45:36.320 --> 00:45:38.000 align:middle line:90%
besides that one decision?

00:45:38.000 --> 00:45:40.190 align:middle line:90%
After that decision?

00:45:40.190 --> 00:45:41.547 align:middle line:90%
What opened up again?

00:45:41.547 --> 00:45:43.130 align:middle line:84%
>>PARTI: You know
what opened up again

00:45:43.130 --> 00:45:48.380 align:middle line:84%
was our communication and
power of forgiveness and love.

00:45:48.380 --> 00:45:52.370 align:middle line:84%
Because when I took my wife
out for dinner the evening

00:45:52.370 --> 00:45:56.690 align:middle line:84%
we were reconciling, I said
what do you want from me?

00:45:56.690 --> 00:45:59.270 align:middle line:90%
And she said three words.

00:45:59.270 --> 00:46:01.850 align:middle line:90%
Respect, care, and love.

00:46:01.850 --> 00:46:04.290 align:middle line:84%
And the order she said it
was very important, too.

00:46:04.290 --> 00:46:05.090 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:46:05.090 --> 00:46:06.506 align:middle line:84%
>>PARTI: She wants
to be respected

00:46:06.506 --> 00:46:08.520 align:middle line:84%
as an equal,
different but equal,

00:46:08.520 --> 00:46:12.420 align:middle line:84%
she wants to be cherished and
cared for, and then loved also.

00:46:12.420 --> 00:46:13.220 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:46:13.220 --> 00:46:15.110 align:middle line:84%
>>PARTI: And
previously I loved her,

00:46:15.110 --> 00:46:17.810 align:middle line:84%
but coming from an
Indian background,

00:46:17.810 --> 00:46:20.260 align:middle line:84%
coming from my
father's generations,

00:46:20.260 --> 00:46:24.920 align:middle line:84%
and that was what I call
a vertical relationship.

00:46:24.920 --> 00:46:26.890 align:middle line:84%
Husband at top, then
the wife, and then kids.

00:46:26.890 --> 00:46:27.690 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:46:27.690 --> 00:46:30.200 align:middle line:84%
>>PARTI: So now it was a
horizontal relationship,

00:46:30.200 --> 00:46:32.950 align:middle line:84%
me and you are
equal but different.

00:46:32.950 --> 00:46:33.750 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:46:33.750 --> 00:46:35.750 align:middle line:84%
>>PARTI: And I started
cherishing her,

00:46:35.750 --> 00:46:40.850 align:middle line:84%
sending her flowers for no
reason, just to say I love you,

00:46:40.850 --> 00:46:43.400 align:middle line:90%
and now I'm so happy.

00:46:43.400 --> 00:46:45.790 align:middle line:84%
In last one and a
half, two years,

00:46:45.790 --> 00:46:48.104 align:middle line:84%
it has been the best time
in 30 years of our marriage.

00:46:48.104 --> 00:46:49.520 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: You said
off-camera when

00:46:49.520 --> 00:46:52.210 align:middle line:84%
we were talking that it's
like you're teenagers again.

00:46:52.210 --> 00:46:54.410 align:middle line:90%
You're in love anew.

00:46:54.410 --> 00:46:57.440 align:middle line:84%
>>PARTI: You know, if
you look at my text,

00:46:57.440 --> 00:47:01.485 align:middle line:84%
when we put the code
for Wi-Fi, there

00:47:01.485 --> 00:47:04.040 align:middle line:84%
were 10 texts which came up,
and they were all from my wife.

00:47:04.040 --> 00:47:06.550 align:middle line:84%
I love you, you'll
do good, miss you,

00:47:06.550 --> 00:47:10.550 align:middle line:84%
with all hearts and
everything, emojis of hearts.

00:47:10.550 --> 00:47:11.510 align:middle line:90%
That's like teenagers.

00:47:11.510 --> 00:47:14.690 align:middle line:84%
We have to text each other
almost every two hours.

00:47:14.690 --> 00:47:17.630 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: But you had to really
tear yourself down to the bones

00:47:17.630 --> 00:47:20.200 align:middle line:84%
of what you were as
a being, as a soul--

00:47:20.200 --> 00:47:21.000 align:middle line:90%
>>PARTI: Exactly.

00:47:21.000 --> 00:47:22.670 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: --to get there.

00:47:22.670 --> 00:47:24.750 align:middle line:84%
>>PARTI: I had to
remake myself again.

00:47:24.750 --> 00:47:26.570 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So let's
talk about now.

00:47:26.570 --> 00:47:29.390 align:middle line:84%
You have this book
out, and how you're

00:47:29.390 --> 00:47:31.910 align:middle line:84%
putting yourself into the
world and working with people.

00:47:31.910 --> 00:47:35.090 align:middle line:84%
>>PARTI: Now what happened,
was because of my heartbreak

00:47:35.090 --> 00:47:37.940 align:middle line:84%
and healing people's
heart, and my heart

00:47:37.940 --> 00:47:41.930 align:middle line:84%
was healed, using the lessons
from my physical near-death

00:47:41.930 --> 00:47:45.680 align:middle line:84%
experience, I'm helping
people, especially

00:47:45.680 --> 00:47:49.790 align:middle line:84%
women who are coming to me
more now, with heartbreaks.

00:47:49.790 --> 00:47:52.380 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Well, heart
disease is on the rise.

00:47:52.380 --> 00:47:55.400 align:middle line:84%
Huge, dramatic increase
in heart disease in women.

00:47:55.400 --> 00:47:56.810 align:middle line:90%
>>PARTI: Because of stress.

00:47:56.810 --> 00:47:58.940 align:middle line:84%
People used to think
that heart disease is

00:47:58.940 --> 00:48:01.770 align:middle line:90%
a disease of the male.

00:48:01.770 --> 00:48:03.670 align:middle line:90%
A plus personality.

00:48:03.670 --> 00:48:08.190 align:middle line:84%
But it's equally
prominent among women.

00:48:08.190 --> 00:48:10.040 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:48:10.040 --> 00:48:10.890 align:middle line:90%
I've looked at that.

00:48:10.890 --> 00:48:14.900 align:middle line:84%
And it seems to me part of it
is that we still, as beings,

00:48:14.900 --> 00:48:19.190 align:middle line:84%
as human beings and souls, have
the same needs, like she said,

00:48:19.190 --> 00:48:22.610 align:middle line:84%
to have the love, to be
cherished, to have respect

00:48:22.610 --> 00:48:23.660 align:middle line:90%
and so forth.

00:48:23.660 --> 00:48:26.690 align:middle line:84%
Yet what happened
over the last 40 years

00:48:26.690 --> 00:48:30.020 align:middle line:84%
is that the women became
really almost the dominant part

00:48:30.020 --> 00:48:31.431 align:middle line:90%
of the workforce.

00:48:31.431 --> 00:48:33.680 align:middle line:84%
And yet you still have the
children you have to raise.

00:48:33.680 --> 00:48:35.600 align:middle line:84%
You still have to do
what else has to be done,

00:48:35.600 --> 00:48:37.975 align:middle line:84%
depending on the amount of
money you make, cook and clean

00:48:37.975 --> 00:48:41.830 align:middle line:84%
and so forth, and the stress
is absolutely overwhelming.

00:48:41.830 --> 00:48:43.370 align:middle line:90%
>>PARTI: Overwhelming.

00:48:43.370 --> 00:48:45.920 align:middle line:90%
Too much is expected of women.

00:48:45.920 --> 00:48:47.960 align:middle line:84%
Giving an example,
I'm being a partner

00:48:47.960 --> 00:48:49.850 align:middle line:90%
with her and everything.

00:48:49.850 --> 00:48:52.460 align:middle line:84%
Previously I would
sit while she was

00:48:52.460 --> 00:48:54.590 align:middle line:90%
cooking after coming home work.

00:48:54.590 --> 00:48:56.750 align:middle line:84%
But now, I don't
know how to cook,

00:48:56.750 --> 00:48:58.770 align:middle line:84%
but I'm cutting
her vegetables, I'm

00:48:58.770 --> 00:49:00.560 align:middle line:84%
getting her the
things she needs,

00:49:00.560 --> 00:49:03.020 align:middle line:84%
I'm peeling the
vegetables, chopping

00:49:03.020 --> 00:49:04.700 align:middle line:90%
the onions, whatever I can.

00:49:04.700 --> 00:49:07.586 align:middle line:84%
So I'm with her in the
kitchen, and she loves it.

00:49:07.586 --> 00:49:08.960 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Yes,
that makes cooking

00:49:08.960 --> 00:49:10.964 align:middle line:90%
a joy instead of a drudgery.

00:49:10.964 --> 00:49:12.380 align:middle line:84%
>>PARTI: Yeah,
it's a partnership.

00:49:12.380 --> 00:49:12.860 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:49:12.860 --> 00:49:15.165 align:middle line:84%
>>PARTI: So now what we
have is true partnership

00:49:15.165 --> 00:49:16.910 align:middle line:90%
and friendship.

00:49:16.910 --> 00:49:18.737 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And she's a
dentist, as I recall?

00:49:18.737 --> 00:49:19.820 align:middle line:90%
>>PARTI: She is a dentist.

00:49:19.820 --> 00:49:21.680 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: She's so she's
still doing her day job.

00:49:21.680 --> 00:49:22.480 align:middle line:90%
>>PARTI: Yeah.

00:49:22.480 --> 00:49:25.340 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: But your day job
now, do you have an office

00:49:25.340 --> 00:49:26.750 align:middle line:90%
or a clinic or how does--

00:49:26.750 --> 00:49:28.760 align:middle line:84%
>>PARTI: I'm moving to
Santa Cruz right now,

00:49:28.760 --> 00:49:30.770 align:middle line:84%
so I'm going to take
up an office there,

00:49:30.770 --> 00:49:33.640 align:middle line:84%
but right now I work primarily
through Skype and on phone.

00:49:33.640 --> 00:49:34.440 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: OK.

00:49:34.440 --> 00:49:36.920 align:middle line:84%
And so when people
find you, what

00:49:36.920 --> 00:49:39.260 align:middle line:84%
is the process you take
them through in your work,

00:49:39.260 --> 00:49:42.260 align:middle line:84%
and what do they most
profoundly respond to?

00:49:42.260 --> 00:49:44.930 align:middle line:84%
>>PARTI: You know,
as most of my clients

00:49:44.930 --> 00:49:47.510 align:middle line:84%
are women, for some
reason, and they're

00:49:47.510 --> 00:49:51.200 align:middle line:84%
been traumatized by different
males in their life,

00:49:51.200 --> 00:49:54.380 align:middle line:84%
and I help them
empower themselves.

00:49:54.380 --> 00:49:58.380 align:middle line:84%
Like archetypal work, or
deal with childhood traumas,

00:49:58.380 --> 00:50:00.690 align:middle line:90%
because there's so much abuse.

00:50:00.690 --> 00:50:04.010 align:middle line:84%
And that has-- the
universe is opening me.

00:50:04.010 --> 00:50:06.500 align:middle line:84%
I didn't start with
working with women,

00:50:06.500 --> 00:50:10.562 align:middle line:84%
but that's what is getting
attracted towards me.

00:50:10.562 --> 00:50:16.042 align:middle line:84%
To help women, I as a male
hold safe space for them.

00:50:16.042 --> 00:50:18.500 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Which is interesting,
because that isn't what you

00:50:18.500 --> 00:50:19.812 align:middle line:90%
expected was going to happen.

00:50:19.812 --> 00:50:21.770 align:middle line:84%
You thought you would be
able to help, perhaps,

00:50:21.770 --> 00:50:24.390 align:middle line:84%
even some of your colleagues
after they fell down and became

00:50:24.390 --> 00:50:25.190 align:middle line:90%
ill.

00:50:25.190 --> 00:50:25.520 align:middle line:90%
>>PARTI: Yeah.

00:50:25.520 --> 00:50:26.960 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: But they're not
the ones coming to you.

00:50:26.960 --> 00:50:29.040 align:middle line:84%
The men aren't coming
in the same way.

00:50:29.040 --> 00:50:31.280 align:middle line:84%
They're not looking
for healing and help

00:50:31.280 --> 00:50:32.790 align:middle line:90%
in the same way women are now.

00:50:32.790 --> 00:50:33.590 align:middle line:90%
>>PARTI: Yeah.

00:50:33.590 --> 00:50:35.990 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: What are you seeing
about that and how that's

00:50:35.990 --> 00:50:39.170 align:middle line:84%
lining up, and then looking
down at your children's

00:50:39.170 --> 00:50:41.570 align:middle line:90%
generation, the differences?

00:50:41.570 --> 00:50:43.900 align:middle line:84%
>>PARTI: Yeah, like my
children, my daughter

00:50:43.900 --> 00:50:46.260 align:middle line:90%
she is a very strong woman.

00:50:46.260 --> 00:50:49.280 align:middle line:84%
I actually named her
after a goddess in India,

00:50:49.280 --> 00:50:52.990 align:middle line:84%
and she turned out to be,
even I can't handle her.

00:50:52.990 --> 00:50:55.920 align:middle line:84%
She's so powerful and
strong, but she's very kind.

00:50:55.920 --> 00:50:56.720 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:50:56.720 --> 00:50:59.570 align:middle line:84%
>>PARTI: And that's what
I want my clients to be,

00:50:59.570 --> 00:51:02.420 align:middle line:90%
equal respectful for male--

00:51:02.420 --> 00:51:04.700 align:middle line:90%
masculine, and noblemen.

00:51:04.700 --> 00:51:07.820 align:middle line:84%
Men should be noblemen,
women should be like goddess,

00:51:07.820 --> 00:51:10.650 align:middle line:84%
and they can be in partnership
and everybody will be happy.

00:51:10.650 --> 00:51:11.450 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:51:11.450 --> 00:51:15.170 align:middle line:84%
So now in your son's
generation, are

00:51:15.170 --> 00:51:17.720 align:middle line:84%
you noticing in your
own life and circle,

00:51:17.720 --> 00:51:20.225 align:middle line:84%
and also among your
clients, that--

00:51:20.225 --> 00:51:22.430 align:middle line:84%
because there is a
generational divide

00:51:22.430 --> 00:51:24.200 align:middle line:84%
in this, of the
women taking it all

00:51:24.200 --> 00:51:26.450 align:middle line:90%
on with no help from the men.

00:51:26.450 --> 00:51:28.550 align:middle line:84%
Are you finding
that the younger men

00:51:28.550 --> 00:51:32.400 align:middle line:84%
are more oriented toward
true partnership now?

00:51:32.400 --> 00:51:35.630 align:middle line:84%
>>PARTI: Yeah, my
daughter has a boyfriend,

00:51:35.630 --> 00:51:38.330 align:middle line:84%
and I write in my book,
actually, my daughter's

00:51:38.330 --> 00:51:39.470 align:middle line:90%
boyfriend is a Muslim.

00:51:39.470 --> 00:51:41.840 align:middle line:84%
I would have never
accepted that.

00:51:41.840 --> 00:51:43.730 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Oh, yeah,
that's a big one.

00:51:43.730 --> 00:51:45.530 align:middle line:84%
>>PARTI: Before my
near-death experience.

00:51:45.530 --> 00:51:46.330 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:51:46.330 --> 00:51:48.710 align:middle line:90%
>>PARTI: But now I accept that.

00:51:48.710 --> 00:51:49.790 align:middle line:90%
Everybody's equal.

00:51:49.790 --> 00:51:52.190 align:middle line:90%
Everybody has the same rights.

00:51:52.190 --> 00:51:55.000 align:middle line:84%
And I wouldn't have accepted
that before, to be honest,

00:51:55.000 --> 00:51:58.480 align:middle line:84%
but coming from that
partnership story I just told.

00:51:58.480 --> 00:52:00.700 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:52:00.700 --> 00:52:04.670 align:middle line:84%
>>PARTI: But my daughter expects
her boyfriend to be a partner,

00:52:04.670 --> 00:52:08.090 align:middle line:84%
and he is a partner, helping
my daughter all the time.

00:52:08.090 --> 00:52:13.190 align:middle line:84%
And a partnership, like somebody
is sick, you do the thing.

00:52:13.190 --> 00:52:16.100 align:middle line:84%
I cannot cook, so when
my wife is very tired,

00:52:16.100 --> 00:52:17.850 align:middle line:84%
I go and bring the
food from outside.

00:52:17.850 --> 00:52:20.270 align:middle line:90%
She feels cared for.

00:52:20.270 --> 00:52:21.820 align:middle line:90%
She feels loved.

00:52:21.820 --> 00:52:25.710 align:middle line:90%
And even love is not a noun.

00:52:25.710 --> 00:52:26.580 align:middle line:90%
It's a verb.

00:52:26.580 --> 00:52:28.450 align:middle line:90%
It is doing.

00:52:28.450 --> 00:52:30.270 align:middle line:90%
It is a state of doing.

00:52:30.270 --> 00:52:31.140 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:52:31.140 --> 00:52:35.055 align:middle line:84%
And so now what
do you recommend?

00:52:35.055 --> 00:52:38.010 align:middle line:84%
Do you also have people
work with meditation

00:52:38.010 --> 00:52:40.280 align:middle line:84%
in almost all
cases in your life?

00:52:40.280 --> 00:52:41.970 align:middle line:84%
>>PARTI: Yeah, all
of my clients I

00:52:41.970 --> 00:52:45.030 align:middle line:84%
help them start a
meditation practice,

00:52:45.030 --> 00:52:47.040 align:middle line:84%
because meditation
is when you connect

00:52:47.040 --> 00:52:53.120 align:middle line:84%
to the stillness, the awareness
within you which is unchanging.

00:52:53.120 --> 00:52:55.020 align:middle line:90%
The higher self.

00:52:55.020 --> 00:52:57.790 align:middle line:84%
If you believe in God or
soul, then it is your soul,

00:52:57.790 --> 00:53:00.590 align:middle line:84%
and you are part of
the spark of God.

00:53:00.590 --> 00:53:03.510 align:middle line:84%
Like in Bible they say
the kingdom of heaven

00:53:03.510 --> 00:53:04.420 align:middle line:90%
is within you.

00:53:04.420 --> 00:53:05.220 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:53:05.220 --> 00:53:06.540 align:middle line:90%
>>PARTI: So it is within you.

00:53:06.540 --> 00:53:09.500 align:middle line:84%
But if you don't believe
in your higher self or God,

00:53:09.500 --> 00:53:11.410 align:middle line:84%
at least you believe
in your own self.

00:53:11.410 --> 00:53:12.210 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:53:12.210 --> 00:53:15.030 align:middle line:84%
>>PARTI: And that's my
thing is empowerment.

00:53:15.030 --> 00:53:18.150 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Now when you started
opening this up in yourself,

00:53:18.150 --> 00:53:21.360 align:middle line:84%
and direct communication with
your soul and beings beyond,

00:53:21.360 --> 00:53:25.170 align:middle line:84%
did you ever then come back
in contact with your father?

00:53:25.170 --> 00:53:30.030 align:middle line:84%
>>PARTI: I have met my
father in dreams and visions,

00:53:30.030 --> 00:53:32.280 align:middle line:90%
and he has been very helpful.

00:53:32.280 --> 00:53:36.350 align:middle line:84%
Like if I've-- even
in worldly things,

00:53:36.350 --> 00:53:38.640 align:middle line:84%
like I would like
to have a sign,

00:53:38.640 --> 00:53:42.450 align:middle line:84%
like if I'm starting a spiritual
practice or if I'm going to buy

00:53:42.450 --> 00:53:46.530 align:middle line:84%
a different house,
show me a sign.

00:53:46.530 --> 00:53:48.370 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Right, and
your dad will show up.

00:53:48.370 --> 00:53:50.580 align:middle line:84%
>>PARTI: Dad will show up,
or the angel will show up

00:53:50.580 --> 00:53:54.000 align:middle line:90%
or the goddess will show up.

00:53:54.000 --> 00:53:56.370 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And I think in
the story, one of the things

00:53:56.370 --> 00:53:58.770 align:middle line:84%
that's so beautiful,
which to me is

00:53:58.770 --> 00:54:00.480 align:middle line:84%
one of our primary
roles in life,

00:54:00.480 --> 00:54:02.640 align:middle line:84%
is whatever we've
inherited-- because so

00:54:02.640 --> 00:54:04.410 align:middle line:84%
many of the different
healing modalities

00:54:04.410 --> 00:54:06.210 align:middle line:90%
go into ancestral work.

00:54:06.210 --> 00:54:09.480 align:middle line:84%
And you know very directly what
your ancestor was like in terms

00:54:09.480 --> 00:54:11.250 align:middle line:90%
of the emotional patterns--

00:54:11.250 --> 00:54:14.190 align:middle line:84%
is that it seems to me
the best a person can do

00:54:14.190 --> 00:54:17.520 align:middle line:84%
is to break an ongoing
negative emotional pattern

00:54:17.520 --> 00:54:18.970 align:middle line:84%
within their
ancestral bloodline.

00:54:18.970 --> 00:54:22.170 align:middle line:84%
>>PARTI: That's so true,
and it's very needed.

00:54:22.170 --> 00:54:23.010 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:54:23.010 --> 00:54:25.301 align:middle line:84%
>>PARTI: It doesn't mean that
a father was an alcoholic

00:54:25.301 --> 00:54:26.700 align:middle line:84%
and abusive, you
have to turn out

00:54:26.700 --> 00:54:29.050 align:middle line:84%
to be alcoholic
and abusive, too.

00:54:29.050 --> 00:54:29.850 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:54:29.850 --> 00:54:36.060 align:middle line:84%
>>PARTI: There's a nature and
nurture, and both make it up.

00:54:36.060 --> 00:54:37.470 align:middle line:90%
You can change your genes.

00:54:37.470 --> 00:54:41.480 align:middle line:84%
In gene expression
nowadays, there's a new--

00:54:41.480 --> 00:54:42.630 align:middle line:90%
epigenetics.

00:54:42.630 --> 00:54:44.570 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Yeah, Bruce
Lipton and others.

00:54:44.570 --> 00:54:46.380 align:middle line:90%
>>PARTI: You can change--

00:54:46.380 --> 00:54:48.125 align:middle line:84%
you may inherit
some genes, but you

00:54:48.125 --> 00:54:50.500 align:middle line:90%
can change the gene expression.

00:54:50.500 --> 00:54:53.970 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So with your own
family and your own children,

00:54:53.970 --> 00:54:58.400 align:middle line:84%
by giving your son that
freedom and permission from you

00:54:58.400 --> 00:55:00.270 align:middle line:84%
to go and do what
you love doing,

00:55:00.270 --> 00:55:02.730 align:middle line:84%
by giving your daughter
a powerful name

00:55:02.730 --> 00:55:05.130 align:middle line:84%
and accepting her Muslim
boyfriend, who she's

00:55:05.130 --> 00:55:07.230 align:middle line:84%
been with for many years,
and seeing that they're

00:55:07.230 --> 00:55:09.660 align:middle line:84%
true partners, they
help each other out,

00:55:09.660 --> 00:55:12.300 align:middle line:84%
it seems to me you've done
that one amazing thing.

00:55:12.300 --> 00:55:15.780 align:middle line:84%
You have broken the chains
of your ancestral past

00:55:15.780 --> 00:55:17.730 align:middle line:84%
and the effect on your
children, and now you

00:55:17.730 --> 00:55:19.720 align:middle line:84%
have a different
outcome for from now on.

00:55:19.720 --> 00:55:22.655 align:middle line:84%
>>PARTI: And I've broken in my
own generation for myself, too.

00:55:22.655 --> 00:55:23.530 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Absolutely.

00:55:23.530 --> 00:55:29.790 align:middle line:84%
>>PARTI: So it's so wonderful,
[NON-ENGLISH] with my wife,

00:55:29.790 --> 00:55:31.430 align:middle line:90%
it is--

00:55:31.430 --> 00:55:33.830 align:middle line:84%
I don't want anything
else in life.

00:55:33.830 --> 00:55:36.080 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And how
do your children

00:55:36.080 --> 00:55:37.670 align:middle line:84%
experience you
and your wife now,

00:55:37.670 --> 00:55:40.940 align:middle line:84%
now that you've become
teenagers in love again?

00:55:40.940 --> 00:55:43.250 align:middle line:84%
>>PARTI: They're very happy,
especially my daughter.

00:55:43.250 --> 00:55:47.630 align:middle line:84%
And I have a younger son,
too, and after he graduated

00:55:47.630 --> 00:55:50.330 align:middle line:84%
from high school after
my near-death experience,

00:55:50.330 --> 00:55:53.610 align:middle line:84%
and I tried to softly say,
go into medical school,

00:55:53.610 --> 00:55:54.410 align:middle line:90%
or dental school.

00:55:54.410 --> 00:55:55.710 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: He was
like, no, no, no.

00:55:55.710 --> 00:55:58.001 align:middle line:84%
>>PARTI: He said, no, no,
no, I want to be an engineer,

00:55:58.001 --> 00:56:01.040 align:middle line:84%
and he just graduated from
UC San Diego and found a job.

00:56:01.040 --> 00:56:02.820 align:middle line:90%
He's very happy too.

00:56:02.820 --> 00:56:05.960 align:middle line:84%
So my younger son benefited
from my interaction

00:56:05.960 --> 00:56:08.990 align:middle line:84%
with the elder son, because
by that time, the chain

00:56:08.990 --> 00:56:09.900 align:middle line:90%
was broken.

00:56:09.900 --> 00:56:11.941 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Yeah, because
even after the near-death

00:56:11.941 --> 00:56:14.000 align:middle line:84%
experience, you didn't
just give it up right away

00:56:14.000 --> 00:56:15.620 align:middle line:90%
on your son becoming a doctor.

00:56:15.620 --> 00:56:18.085 align:middle line:84%
You still had to kind of
work your way to that.

00:56:18.085 --> 00:56:20.210 align:middle line:84%
>>PARTI: Because all my
friends' kids were doctors,

00:56:20.210 --> 00:56:21.270 align:middle line:90%
all my friends kids--

00:56:21.270 --> 00:56:22.410 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:56:22.410 --> 00:56:24.020 align:middle line:84%
>>PARTI: But my
daughter on her own

00:56:24.020 --> 00:56:27.230 align:middle line:84%
chose to become a
dentist like her mother.

00:56:27.230 --> 00:56:28.160 align:middle line:90%
We didn't push her.

00:56:28.160 --> 00:56:29.160 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:56:29.160 --> 00:56:33.050 align:middle line:84%
OK, so really, now, we have
just a few minutes left.

00:56:33.050 --> 00:56:35.510 align:middle line:84%
What is it that we have not
talked about that you'd really

00:56:35.510 --> 00:56:38.420 align:middle line:84%
like to share with people
about this incredible journey

00:56:38.420 --> 00:56:40.670 align:middle line:84%
of the soul that we
tend to take for granted

00:56:40.670 --> 00:56:42.980 align:middle line:84%
and need to have so
much more respect for?

00:56:42.980 --> 00:56:47.220 align:middle line:84%
>>PARTI: You know, like
practice meditation, prayer,

00:56:47.220 --> 00:56:48.020 align:middle line:90%
and service.

00:56:48.020 --> 00:56:49.640 align:middle line:90%
Service is very important.

00:56:49.640 --> 00:56:52.960 align:middle line:90%
When your spiritual journey is--

00:56:52.960 --> 00:56:57.680 align:middle line:84%
when you move from your
own self to others.

00:56:57.680 --> 00:56:59.840 align:middle line:84%
That's what I'm trying
to do in my life.

00:56:59.840 --> 00:57:01.720 align:middle line:90%
We still have to pay bills.

00:57:01.720 --> 00:57:02.910 align:middle line:90%
We still have to make money.

00:57:02.910 --> 00:57:05.030 align:middle line:90%
But there has to be a balance.

00:57:05.030 --> 00:57:08.390 align:middle line:84%
And biggest mantra I
teach about in my book

00:57:08.390 --> 00:57:12.710 align:middle line:84%
and I tell my clients is
forgive, love, and heal.

00:57:12.710 --> 00:57:14.800 align:middle line:10%
So if you forgive--

00:57:14.800 --> 00:57:19.630 align:middle line:10%
and forgiveness is
not for anybody else.

00:57:19.630 --> 00:57:20.980 align:middle line:10%
It is for your own self.

00:57:20.980 --> 00:57:23.180 align:middle line:84%
You're not condoning
their action,

00:57:23.180 --> 00:57:24.910 align:middle line:90%
but you're letting it go.

00:57:24.910 --> 00:57:27.390 align:middle line:84%
Letting go is very
important in life.

00:57:27.390 --> 00:57:29.140 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And you had
to forgive yourself.

00:57:29.140 --> 00:57:31.210 align:middle line:84%
>>PARTI: I had to
forgive myself.

00:57:31.210 --> 00:57:32.500 align:middle line:90%
So forgive yourself.

00:57:32.500 --> 00:57:35.820 align:middle line:90%
I even wrote forgive God.

00:57:35.820 --> 00:57:37.180 align:middle line:10%
I was very mad at God.

00:57:37.180 --> 00:57:39.447 align:middle line:10%
Why do things matter, and
life turn out this way?

00:57:39.447 --> 00:57:41.530 align:middle line:84%
And that way, I wrote a
forgiveness letter to God.

00:57:41.530 --> 00:57:44.470 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Oh yeah, Raj
number one, or 1.0,

00:57:44.470 --> 00:57:47.570 align:middle line:84%
would say, I'm a doctor,
how can you do this to me?

00:57:47.570 --> 00:57:48.370 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHTER]

00:57:48.370 --> 00:57:50.410 align:middle line:90%
>>PARTI: That's what I'm saying.

00:57:50.410 --> 00:57:54.760 align:middle line:84%
So forgiveness is
very important.

00:57:54.760 --> 00:58:00.470 align:middle line:84%
Yourself, God, your spouse, your
children, and from that state,

00:58:00.470 --> 00:58:02.306 align:middle line:90%
life becomes bliss.

00:58:02.306 --> 00:58:04.930 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And then when you talk
about service, a lot of people

00:58:04.930 --> 00:58:06.850 align:middle line:84%
think, oh my god,
I do not have time

00:58:06.850 --> 00:58:08.399 align:middle line:90%
to volunteer for one more thing.

00:58:08.399 --> 00:58:09.940 align:middle line:84%
That's not what
you're talking about.

00:58:09.940 --> 00:58:10.740 align:middle line:90%
>>PARTI: No.

00:58:10.740 --> 00:58:13.600 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Talk about the essence
of service for just a moment

00:58:13.600 --> 00:58:14.050 align:middle line:90%
before we--

00:58:14.050 --> 00:58:15.175 align:middle line:90%
>>PARTI: It's the attitude.

00:58:15.175 --> 00:58:18.580 align:middle line:84%
Is Like as a doctor,
when a client, a patient

00:58:18.580 --> 00:58:21.460 align:middle line:84%
comes to them, then
you should feel

00:58:21.460 --> 00:58:24.550 align:middle line:84%
honored that he or
she is given you

00:58:24.550 --> 00:58:28.250 align:middle line:90%
the opportunity to serve them.

00:58:28.250 --> 00:58:33.050 align:middle line:84%
And if you go over that
attitude, it's different.

00:58:33.050 --> 00:58:35.520 align:middle line:90%
The patient feels the energy.

00:58:35.520 --> 00:58:38.060 align:middle line:84%
You may not believe
in energies as such--

00:58:38.060 --> 00:58:40.030 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Oh, everyone
watching this does.

00:58:40.030 --> 00:58:42.070 align:middle line:84%
>>PARTI: Yeah, there
is energy transmission,

00:58:42.070 --> 00:58:47.030 align:middle line:84%
even through telephone lines,
how you interact with people.

00:58:47.030 --> 00:58:48.910 align:middle line:90%
And that's very important.

00:58:48.910 --> 00:58:51.620 align:middle line:84%
Can you imagine if
politicians really had

00:58:51.620 --> 00:58:53.497 align:middle line:90%
the idea of service and seva--

00:58:53.497 --> 00:58:55.845 align:middle line:84%
I call it in Sanskrit--
seva, the world

00:58:55.845 --> 00:58:57.820 align:middle line:90%
would be a different place.

00:58:57.820 --> 00:59:00.680 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Absolutely, and just
with each other on a day in,

00:59:00.680 --> 00:59:03.100 align:middle line:84%
day out basis, rather
than rushing by not only

00:59:03.100 --> 00:59:04.500 align:middle line:90%
our partners and our kids.

00:59:04.500 --> 00:59:07.060 align:middle line:84%
We even rush by our own lives,
not paying any attention

00:59:07.060 --> 00:59:09.140 align:middle line:84%
to the clues and the
things that are happening.

00:59:09.140 --> 00:59:11.320 align:middle line:10%
Just to stop and
even just observe

00:59:11.320 --> 00:59:13.910 align:middle line:10%
what's needed in the moment and
offer that little bit of self.

00:59:13.910 --> 00:59:14.710 align:middle line:90%
>>PARTI: Yeah.

00:59:14.710 --> 00:59:15.720 align:middle line:90%
Be present now.

00:59:15.720 --> 00:59:16.520 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:59:16.520 --> 00:59:18.490 align:middle line:84%
>>PARTI: Letting
go and being now.

00:59:18.490 --> 00:59:19.990 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Well, on
that note, I want

00:59:19.990 --> 00:59:23.140 align:middle line:84%
to thank you so much for sharing
your story with us again.

00:59:23.140 --> 00:59:25.135 align:middle line:84%
I just found it
completely refreshing.

00:59:25.135 --> 00:59:28.700 align:middle line:84%
>>PARTI: It was my pleasure
and honor to be here.

00:59:28.700 --> 00:59:30.100 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Thank you, Raj.

00:59:30.100 --> 00:59:32.830 align:middle line:84%
