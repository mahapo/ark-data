00:00:27.569 --> 00:00:30.110 align:middle line:10%
>>REGINA MEREDITH: In my last
conversation with Paola Harris,

00:00:30.110 --> 00:00:33.565 align:middle line:10%
we discussed some of the more
well-researched UFO cases.

00:00:33.565 --> 00:00:34.940 align:middle line:84%
Today, we're going
to take a look

00:00:34.940 --> 00:00:38.220 align:middle line:84%
at what's happening in South
America, Mexico, China,

00:00:38.220 --> 00:00:40.780 align:middle line:84%
just about any other region
of the world except the US

00:00:40.780 --> 00:00:43.530 align:middle line:84%
where, apparently, UFOs
feel safer to appear

00:00:43.530 --> 00:00:44.635 align:middle line:90%
than they do over the US.

00:00:44.635 --> 00:00:46.170 align:middle line:90%
So welcome back, Paola.

00:00:46.170 --> 00:00:49.040 align:middle line:84%
That was a fabulous
conversation, the last one.

00:00:49.040 --> 00:00:51.320 align:middle line:84%
You know, I'm just so happy
to have you on the show,

00:00:51.320 --> 00:00:54.660 align:middle line:84%
because this is
my own statement.

00:00:54.660 --> 00:00:58.240 align:middle line:84%
You, in my opinion, have not
gotten the credit you deserve.

00:00:58.240 --> 00:00:59.860 align:middle line:84%
All these other
guys are out there

00:00:59.860 --> 00:01:02.730 align:middle line:84%
hopping around getting the
credit for UFO research

00:01:02.730 --> 00:01:04.440 align:middle line:84%
that you actually
have been doing.

00:01:04.440 --> 00:01:06.770 align:middle line:84%
And it just annoys
the heck out of me.

00:01:06.770 --> 00:01:09.030 align:middle line:90%
You know, you should be the one.

00:01:09.030 --> 00:01:10.620 align:middle line:90%
You're the queen of this stuff.

00:01:10.620 --> 00:01:12.860 align:middle line:84%
So, anyway, I'm glad
we're here talking anyway.

00:01:12.860 --> 00:01:13.630 align:middle line:90%
>>PAOLA HARRIS: Let me add.

00:01:13.630 --> 00:01:14.900 align:middle line:84%
It's not about credit.
i just want to know.

00:01:14.900 --> 00:01:16.460 align:middle line:84%
Don't you want to know
what the story is?

00:01:16.460 --> 00:01:18.020 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Of course
I just want to know.

00:01:18.020 --> 00:01:19.603 align:middle line:84%
But you do, you've
done the hard work.

00:01:19.603 --> 00:01:21.160 align:middle line:90%
And the guys get the credit.

00:01:21.160 --> 00:01:22.320 align:middle line:90%
I don't like that.

00:01:22.320 --> 00:01:25.710 align:middle line:84%
OK, so anyway, another thing
you were doing recently

00:01:25.710 --> 00:01:29.560 align:middle line:84%
is you attended the 40th
anniversary of the Travis

00:01:29.560 --> 00:01:32.210 align:middle line:84%
Walton event,
which certainly has

00:01:32.210 --> 00:01:36.090 align:middle line:84%
been one of the most researched,
the most publicized, highly

00:01:36.090 --> 00:01:37.570 align:middle line:90%
witnessed cases ever.

00:01:37.570 --> 00:01:39.750 align:middle line:84%
And when you came
back, you said you

00:01:39.750 --> 00:01:42.150 align:middle line:84%
thought it was one of the
most profound events you

00:01:42.150 --> 00:01:42.950 align:middle line:90%
had been to.

00:01:42.950 --> 00:01:48.140 align:middle line:84%
So let's launch into--
should we take a little-- why

00:01:48.140 --> 00:01:49.880 align:middle line:84%
don't you set up the
Travis Walton event?

00:01:49.880 --> 00:01:52.610 align:middle line:84%
Then we'll show a little trailer
from the Hollywood film that

00:01:52.610 --> 00:01:54.040 align:middle line:90%
was done on his experience.

00:01:54.040 --> 00:01:55.400 align:middle line:90%
And then we'll dig into it, OK?

00:01:55.400 --> 00:01:58.085 align:middle line:10%
>>HARRIS: OK, well the thing
is I was invited as a speaker

00:01:58.085 --> 00:01:58.885 align:middle line:10%
there.

00:01:58.885 --> 00:02:01.530 align:middle line:10%
But as a destiny would
have it, because we

00:02:01.530 --> 00:02:04.680 align:middle line:10%
talked about density,
I met his brother.

00:02:04.680 --> 00:02:07.170 align:middle line:10%
As I had come in,
his brother Don

00:02:07.170 --> 00:02:09.410 align:middle line:10%
was sitting there
with his family.

00:02:09.410 --> 00:02:12.114 align:middle line:84%
So right away, as a journalist,
I forgot that I was speaker.

00:02:12.114 --> 00:02:13.405 align:middle line:90%
And I sat with his brother Don.

00:02:13.405 --> 00:02:15.110 align:middle line:90%
And I started taking notes.

00:02:15.110 --> 00:02:17.550 align:middle line:84%
And his brother
Don said, would you

00:02:17.550 --> 00:02:19.100 align:middle line:90%
like to go to the actual site?

00:02:19.100 --> 00:02:22.500 align:middle line:84%
And so I'm driving with his
family to the actual site,

00:02:22.500 --> 00:02:25.090 align:middle line:84%
where everybody else took
a school bus or whatever.

00:02:25.090 --> 00:02:29.320 align:middle line:84%
So I was asking because of
my curiosity, different ideas

00:02:29.320 --> 00:02:31.290 align:middle line:90%
about what really happened.

00:02:31.290 --> 00:02:35.500 align:middle line:84%
And I found out that
to the initial call

00:02:35.500 --> 00:02:38.670 align:middle line:84%
when Travis was found came
into his brother-in-law,

00:02:38.670 --> 00:02:42.790 align:middle line:84%
and that his other brother
Dwayne went to pick him up,

00:02:42.790 --> 00:02:46.870 align:middle line:84%
but that the mother already
knew that it was real

00:02:46.870 --> 00:02:49.300 align:middle line:84%
because they had had
sightings before Travis.

00:02:49.300 --> 00:02:51.000 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: OK, now
let's backtrack

00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:53.690 align:middle line:84%
a little bit of to that night
and what actually happened.

00:02:53.690 --> 00:02:55.500 align:middle line:90%
Just give us the basic setup.

00:02:55.500 --> 00:02:57.840 align:middle line:84%
>>HARRIS: The basic of
the Travis Walton case.

00:02:57.840 --> 00:02:58.680 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: For those who
don't know about it.

00:02:58.680 --> 00:03:00.470 align:middle line:90%
>>HARRIS: They were lumberjacks.

00:03:00.470 --> 00:03:01.820 align:middle line:90%
They were cutting down trees.

00:03:01.820 --> 00:03:03.540 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Got some
boys out in the woods.

00:03:03.540 --> 00:03:04.790 align:middle line:90%
>>HARRIS: They're coming back.

00:03:04.790 --> 00:03:07.110 align:middle line:84%
They see something
that looks like a fire.

00:03:07.110 --> 00:03:08.840 align:middle line:90%
And they're very worried.

00:03:08.840 --> 00:03:11.670 align:middle line:84%
And as they get closer, they
realize it's not a fire.

00:03:11.670 --> 00:03:14.970 align:middle line:84%
It's called a fire in the
sky, is Travis's book.

00:03:14.970 --> 00:03:16.380 align:middle line:90%
And they get very close.

00:03:16.380 --> 00:03:18.170 align:middle line:84%
And they see up
close and personal,

00:03:18.170 --> 00:03:21.410 align:middle line:84%
a UFO that is kind
of hovering over

00:03:21.410 --> 00:03:23.950 align:middle line:84%
an area in the forest,
kind of a meadow.

00:03:23.950 --> 00:03:26.290 align:middle line:84%
And, of course, Travis who
is very, very curious--

00:03:26.290 --> 00:03:28.560 align:middle line:84%
they told me that Travis
was the kind of guy that

00:03:28.560 --> 00:03:32.240 align:middle line:84%
used to ride bucking
Broncos, that used to be-- I

00:03:32.240 --> 00:03:33.390 align:middle line:90%
didn't know this about him.

00:03:33.390 --> 00:03:34.556 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: He seems the type.

00:03:34.556 --> 00:03:37.382 align:middle line:84%
He's a really kind of
wiry, brave, curious guy.

00:03:37.382 --> 00:03:38.340 align:middle line:90%
>>HARRIS: He's curious.

00:03:38.340 --> 00:03:39.744 align:middle line:90%
He doesn't worry about anything.

00:03:39.744 --> 00:03:40.910 align:middle line:90%
He's not afraid of anything.

00:03:40.910 --> 00:03:43.480 align:middle line:84%
He jumps out of the car
before the car-- not the car,

00:03:43.480 --> 00:03:44.990 align:middle line:90%
the track is even stopped.

00:03:44.990 --> 00:03:48.070 align:middle line:84%
He jumps out, opens the door
and jump out, goes under it.

00:03:48.070 --> 00:03:51.660 align:middle line:84%
When he's under it, he
realizes he's in danger.

00:03:51.660 --> 00:03:53.910 align:middle line:90%
He tries to come back.

00:03:53.910 --> 00:03:56.800 align:middle line:84%
And that's when
the beam gets him.

00:03:56.800 --> 00:04:00.590 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: OK, so let's take a
look at this little video clip,

00:04:00.590 --> 00:04:01.390 align:middle line:90%
OK?

-Hey, Mike!

-Travis, get out of there!

00:05:13.490 --> 00:05:15.316 align:middle line:90%
Travis, get back here!

Travis!

00:06:08.669 --> 00:06:10.960 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Somewhat dramatized--
I mean, it's Hollywood.

00:06:10.960 --> 00:06:13.170 align:middle line:84%
But not really, I mean
this was his account.

00:06:13.170 --> 00:06:14.560 align:middle line:90%
This was his experience.

00:06:14.560 --> 00:06:17.790 align:middle line:84%
So let's talk about what
happened after he's beamed up,

00:06:17.790 --> 00:06:20.790 align:middle line:84%
and what his experience
was, how long it lasted,

00:06:20.790 --> 00:06:22.640 align:middle line:90%
who witnessed it, the whole bit.

00:06:22.640 --> 00:06:25.830 align:middle line:84%
>>HARRIS: Well, the
other guys, lead

00:06:25.830 --> 00:06:31.410 align:middle line:84%
by the boss, the person
that was directing all this,

00:06:31.410 --> 00:06:34.499 align:middle line:84%
was Mike Rogers, who was
his brother-in-law, who

00:06:34.499 --> 00:06:36.790 align:middle line:84%
would become his brother-in-law,
because he was engaged

00:06:36.790 --> 00:06:40.460 align:middle line:90%
to Dana, Mike's younger sister.

00:06:40.460 --> 00:06:43.970 align:middle line:84%
And the thing is, Mike
Rogers, when it happened,

00:06:43.970 --> 00:06:45.380 align:middle line:90%
they thought Travis was dead.

00:06:45.380 --> 00:06:48.060 align:middle line:84%
So they took off right
away out of fear.

00:06:48.060 --> 00:06:51.750 align:middle line:84%
Then they stopped and
realized they had left him.

00:06:51.750 --> 00:06:52.950 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Left him for dead.

00:06:52.950 --> 00:06:55.980 align:middle line:84%
>>HARRIS: Yeah, left him
for dead, felt guilty.

00:06:55.980 --> 00:06:57.314 align:middle line:90%
They went back.

00:06:57.314 --> 00:06:58.355 align:middle line:90%
They looked for his body.

00:06:58.355 --> 00:06:59.240 align:middle line:90%
And it was gone.

00:06:59.240 --> 00:07:03.170 align:middle line:84%
And they were in a
real dilemma there,

00:07:03.170 --> 00:07:07.190 align:middle line:84%
because they had to go back to
town and report what happened.

00:07:07.190 --> 00:07:09.470 align:middle line:84%
But the story was
so amazing, they

00:07:09.470 --> 00:07:11.020 align:middle line:90%
knew they wouldn't be believed.

00:07:11.020 --> 00:07:17.200 align:middle line:84%
And so what happened was
that those boys, those guys,

00:07:17.200 --> 00:07:20.890 align:middle line:84%
were-- what happened
is the questioning that

00:07:20.890 --> 00:07:26.000 align:middle line:84%
was done by Sheriff Gillespie
was that they had killed him.

00:07:26.000 --> 00:07:28.910 align:middle line:84%
So since then, they were
all-- and, by the way,

00:07:28.910 --> 00:07:30.504 align:middle line:84%
I didn't realize,
they were detained.

00:07:30.504 --> 00:07:31.420 align:middle line:90%
They couldn't go home.

00:07:31.420 --> 00:07:32.503 align:middle line:90%
They were, like, arrested.

00:07:32.503 --> 00:07:33.910 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: For how long?

00:07:33.910 --> 00:07:36.750 align:middle line:84%
>>HARRIS: Until they finished
the lie detector tests,

00:07:36.750 --> 00:07:38.800 align:middle line:84%
because then the
way out of that was

00:07:38.800 --> 00:07:41.974 align:middle line:84%
to take the lie detector test,
the story was so incredible.

00:07:41.974 --> 00:07:43.140 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Did they all pass?

00:07:43.140 --> 00:07:46.530 align:middle line:84%
>>HARRIS: They all
passed, except Dallas.

00:07:46.530 --> 00:07:49.827 align:middle line:84%
Dallas was the one
that was-- he had

00:07:49.827 --> 00:07:51.035 align:middle line:90%
been in trouble with the law.

00:07:51.035 --> 00:07:52.370 align:middle line:90%
They explained this to me.

00:07:52.370 --> 00:07:54.820 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So he was a
little jumpy anyway.

00:07:54.820 --> 00:07:55.905 align:middle line:90%
That makes sense.

00:07:55.905 --> 00:07:57.980 align:middle line:84%
>>HARRIS: And Dallas'
test was not--

00:07:57.980 --> 00:08:00.120 align:middle line:84%
in the movie they said
was non-conclusive.

00:08:00.120 --> 00:08:01.480 align:middle line:90%
All the others passed.

00:08:01.480 --> 00:08:04.400 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: OK, so he was
just jumpy, so go ahead.

00:08:04.400 --> 00:08:08.850 align:middle line:84%
>>HARRIS: And so what happened
was then the whole world

00:08:08.850 --> 00:08:11.410 align:middle line:90%
descended upon this city.

00:08:11.410 --> 00:08:13.520 align:middle line:84%
And they had to deal
with damage control,

00:08:13.520 --> 00:08:16.570 align:middle line:84%
because not only did
[INAUDIBLE], the UFOligist

00:08:16.570 --> 00:08:20.430 align:middle line:84%
come, they told me that
the sheriff had telephones

00:08:20.430 --> 00:08:24.020 align:middle line:84%
in both ears from the media
all around the world that

00:08:24.020 --> 00:08:25.200 align:middle line:90%
covered this story.

00:08:25.200 --> 00:08:27.110 align:middle line:84%
I mean, it got in the
National Enquirer.

00:08:27.110 --> 00:08:30.080 align:middle line:84%
But the situation
was that it was real.

00:08:30.080 --> 00:08:32.530 align:middle line:84%
These men were
telling the truth.

00:08:32.530 --> 00:08:35.080 align:middle line:84%
And since we don't have
that in our world view,

00:08:35.080 --> 00:08:37.110 align:middle line:90%
it was a shocker for everybody.

00:08:37.110 --> 00:08:39.789 align:middle line:90%
Travis was gone for five days.

00:08:39.789 --> 00:08:42.280 align:middle line:84%
And then I even got to go
to the telephone booth.

00:08:42.280 --> 00:08:44.179 align:middle line:84%
I said, Travis,
which booth was it?

00:08:44.179 --> 00:08:46.920 align:middle line:84%
And he told me it was
the one in the middle.

00:08:46.920 --> 00:08:48.810 align:middle line:84%
And I even got to see
where they left him

00:08:48.810 --> 00:08:51.430 align:middle line:84%
on the highway, which
for me as a journalist

00:08:51.430 --> 00:08:52.810 align:middle line:90%
it was like history.

00:08:52.810 --> 00:08:54.280 align:middle line:90%
I was reliving history.

00:08:54.280 --> 00:08:57.290 align:middle line:84%
And he walked in
the rain and snow,

00:08:57.290 --> 00:09:00.970 align:middle line:84%
because I remember
it was in November.

00:09:00.970 --> 00:09:02.490 align:middle line:90%
And he walked over to the booth.

00:09:02.490 --> 00:09:04.950 align:middle line:84%
And he was exhausted
by that time.

00:09:04.950 --> 00:09:07.650 align:middle line:84%
He himself thought he had
been gone just a short time,

00:09:07.650 --> 00:09:10.880 align:middle line:84%
until his brother said-- when
his brother picked him up,

00:09:10.880 --> 00:09:13.170 align:middle line:84%
look at the growth
of your beard.

00:09:13.170 --> 00:09:14.680 align:middle line:90%
Look at the growth you've got.

00:09:14.680 --> 00:09:16.870 align:middle line:90%
It's a five day growth.

00:09:16.870 --> 00:09:20.105 align:middle line:84%
Travis himself was totally,
totally traumatized.

00:09:20.105 --> 00:09:24.240 align:middle line:84%
He was taken to a hospital
to have him examined.

00:09:24.240 --> 00:09:28.030 align:middle line:84%
Thank God that happened,
because that took away

00:09:28.030 --> 00:09:30.190 align:middle line:84%
all the idea that
he was a charlatan,

00:09:30.190 --> 00:09:33.810 align:middle line:84%
he had made it up, that
it was a publicity stunt.

00:09:33.810 --> 00:09:35.740 align:middle line:90%
So everything was done properly.

00:09:35.740 --> 00:09:38.010 align:middle line:84%
And it was like-- the only
way you can describe it

00:09:38.010 --> 00:09:42.340 align:middle line:84%
as a journalist, it was
a police forensic case

00:09:42.340 --> 00:09:47.100 align:middle line:84%
that you would do in a
criminal activity case.

00:09:47.100 --> 00:09:49.630 align:middle line:84%
So everything, the
lie detector test,

00:09:49.630 --> 00:09:52.530 align:middle line:84%
the tests that were
done, and so forth.

00:09:52.530 --> 00:09:53.890 align:middle line:90%
I talked to the family.

00:09:53.890 --> 00:09:56.970 align:middle line:84%
And as I mentioned
before, they said,

00:09:56.970 --> 00:10:00.330 align:middle line:84%
well, we used to live
out in the rural areas.

00:10:00.330 --> 00:10:02.350 align:middle line:90%
So we'd see UFOs all the time.

00:10:02.350 --> 00:10:07.744 align:middle line:84%
When we told our mother,
she said, they got him.

00:10:07.744 --> 00:10:08.660 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Interesting.

00:10:08.660 --> 00:10:09.985 align:middle line:84%
>>HARRIS: The
words they got him.

00:10:09.985 --> 00:10:12.026 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So she was
familiar with that activity.

00:10:12.026 --> 00:10:14.402 align:middle line:84%
>>HARRIS: Yes, she also
thought they'd bring him back.

00:10:14.402 --> 00:10:18.640 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Well, mom was
right, mother's intuition.

00:10:18.640 --> 00:10:21.840 align:middle line:84%
Tell us a little bit about
while he was on board

00:10:21.840 --> 00:10:23.319 align:middle line:90%
what his experience was.

00:10:23.319 --> 00:10:25.360 align:middle line:84%
>>HARRIS: I think initially
because of Hollywood,

00:10:25.360 --> 00:10:28.080 align:middle line:84%
and because the slant
the was put on that,

00:10:28.080 --> 00:10:32.650 align:middle line:84%
was a slant of terror,
because that's what sells.

00:10:32.650 --> 00:10:35.000 align:middle line:84%
People thought that was
a negative experience.

00:10:35.000 --> 00:10:37.730 align:middle line:84%
But Travis, in talking
to Travis both here

00:10:37.730 --> 00:10:39.850 align:middle line:84%
and in Rome when
he can to visit me,

00:10:39.850 --> 00:10:43.360 align:middle line:84%
because I had him come twice
to speak to the Italian people,

00:10:43.360 --> 00:10:49.000 align:middle line:84%
he said it was an emergency
intervention, because he really

00:10:49.000 --> 00:10:50.650 align:middle line:84%
believes he could
have been dead.

00:10:50.650 --> 00:10:52.790 align:middle line:90%
And he was brought back to life.

00:10:52.790 --> 00:10:54.800 align:middle line:84%
And because, you know,
we're not used to it,

00:10:54.800 --> 00:10:57.870 align:middle line:84%
there were the three
grey beings that came in.

00:10:57.870 --> 00:11:00.920 align:middle line:84%
And Travis said that
he jumped off the table

00:11:00.920 --> 00:11:03.195 align:middle line:84%
and grabbed the
first tool he saw.

00:11:03.195 --> 00:11:09.610 align:middle line:84%
And he threw it at them, because
that's a natural reaction.

00:11:09.610 --> 00:11:11.590 align:middle line:84%
Then he said he walked
around the craft,

00:11:11.590 --> 00:11:14.250 align:middle line:84%
and went into a room
that had one chair.

00:11:14.250 --> 00:11:17.760 align:middle line:84%
But he said that
chair had the ability

00:11:17.760 --> 00:11:20.320 align:middle line:84%
to transform the room
into a room of stars.

00:11:20.320 --> 00:11:21.800 align:middle line:90%
It was transparent.

00:11:21.800 --> 00:11:25.795 align:middle line:84%
So it looked like he was--
it was some kind of almost

00:11:25.795 --> 00:11:26.595 align:middle line:90%
observatory.

00:11:26.595 --> 00:11:29.650 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: I was going to say
viewing chamber of some kind.

00:11:29.650 --> 00:11:32.790 align:middle line:84%
>>HARRIS: Then this gentleman
came in with blond hair

00:11:32.790 --> 00:11:35.800 align:middle line:84%
and blue one piece space
suit that had a helmet.

00:11:35.800 --> 00:11:37.580 align:middle line:84%
And Travis started
screaming at him,

00:11:37.580 --> 00:11:39.370 align:middle line:90%
because he thought he was human.

00:11:39.370 --> 00:11:42.630 align:middle line:84%
And this gentleman
took Travis out.

00:11:42.630 --> 00:11:45.520 align:middle line:84%
In other words, Travis saw
that he looked like him.

00:11:45.520 --> 00:11:51.700 align:middle line:84%
And so he followed
the man out on a ramp,

00:11:51.700 --> 00:11:53.370 align:middle line:90%
in what he thought was a hanger.

00:11:53.370 --> 00:11:55.140 align:middle line:90%
He saw other craft.

00:11:55.140 --> 00:11:58.970 align:middle line:84%
The man walked over to a woman,
who looked very much like him.

00:11:58.970 --> 00:12:01.990 align:middle line:84%
In fact, he called them the
brother and sister, or clones.

00:12:01.990 --> 00:12:04.770 align:middle line:84%
And he said he was then
put on another table.

00:12:04.770 --> 00:12:07.820 align:middle line:84%
And the woman had like a gas
mask, or some kind of mask

00:12:07.820 --> 00:12:08.620 align:middle line:90%
she put.

00:12:08.620 --> 00:12:10.130 align:middle line:90%
And he said he struggled.

00:12:10.130 --> 00:12:12.570 align:middle line:84%
He said he spent so much
time struggling with them,

00:12:12.570 --> 00:12:17.320 align:middle line:84%
by the time they left him on the
road-- by the side of the road.

00:12:17.320 --> 00:12:19.320 align:middle line:84%
They didn't leave him in
the middle of the road.

00:12:19.320 --> 00:12:20.361 align:middle line:90%
And he was fully clothed.

00:12:20.361 --> 00:12:22.990 align:middle line:84%
He wasn't naked the
way it is in the movie.

00:12:22.990 --> 00:12:23.950 align:middle line:90%
He said, he looked up.

00:12:23.950 --> 00:12:25.930 align:middle line:90%
And he saw the craft took off.

00:12:25.930 --> 00:12:29.010 align:middle line:84%
Now, was it an
emergency intervention?

00:12:29.010 --> 00:12:31.890 align:middle line:84%
Quite possibly, Travis
was at the wrong place

00:12:31.890 --> 00:12:33.300 align:middle line:90%
at the wrong time.

00:12:33.300 --> 00:12:36.340 align:middle line:84%
But I want people to think
about what that means.

00:12:36.340 --> 00:12:39.240 align:middle line:84%
Think of the responsibility
the beings took,

00:12:39.240 --> 00:12:41.980 align:middle line:84%
the fact that they didn't--
yeah, he was traumatized.

00:12:41.980 --> 00:12:44.590 align:middle line:84%
But they didn't leave
him there for dead.

00:12:44.590 --> 00:12:48.750 align:middle line:84%
My question was, what was
that thing doing there?

00:12:48.750 --> 00:12:51.850 align:middle line:90%
It wasn't looking at the trees.

00:12:51.850 --> 00:12:54.730 align:middle line:84%
Although the trees
were growing faster,

00:12:54.730 --> 00:12:57.570 align:middle line:84%
they looked at the
tree ring from when

00:12:57.570 --> 00:12:59.040 align:middle line:90%
it happened in the '70s.

00:12:59.040 --> 00:13:03.930 align:middle line:84%
And the trees grew
faster in that clearing

00:13:03.930 --> 00:13:04.920 align:middle line:90%
and anywhere else.

00:13:04.920 --> 00:13:07.550 align:middle line:90%
And that's the scientific part.

00:13:07.550 --> 00:13:14.590 align:middle line:84%
But Dana Travis's ex-wife
said that at that time,

00:13:14.590 --> 00:13:18.280 align:middle line:84%
there was testing done in
Nevada-- atomic testing done

00:13:18.280 --> 00:13:20.852 align:middle line:84%
in Nevada-- on the
bases in Nevada.

00:13:20.852 --> 00:13:24.700 align:middle line:84%
And the fallout was
coming over into Arizona.

00:13:24.700 --> 00:13:26.310 align:middle line:84%
So a lot of people
were getting sick.

00:13:26.310 --> 00:13:29.280 align:middle line:84%
There was a lot of cases
of leukemia, and so forth.

00:13:29.280 --> 00:13:30.200 align:middle line:90%
And this happens.

00:13:30.200 --> 00:13:33.130 align:middle line:90%


00:13:33.130 --> 00:13:35.852 align:middle line:84%
Is it possible that craft
was measuring radiation?

00:13:35.852 --> 00:13:36.893 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Quite possible.

00:13:36.893 --> 00:13:39.270 align:middle line:84%
>>HARRIS: And it's not
going to do it with people.

00:13:39.270 --> 00:13:41.870 align:middle line:84%
It's going to do it with
the flora and fauna.

00:13:41.870 --> 00:13:43.950 align:middle line:90%
It's going to it with trees.

00:13:43.950 --> 00:13:46.400 align:middle line:84%
And then the radiation
accumulates also.

00:13:46.400 --> 00:13:49.620 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: So he was just there.

00:13:49.620 --> 00:13:52.780 align:middle line:84%
>>HARRIS: But it's all
destiny too, though.

00:13:52.780 --> 00:13:58.120 align:middle line:84%
This case made
abduction serious,

00:13:58.120 --> 00:14:01.160 align:middle line:84%
because it was treated
like a criminal case.

00:14:01.160 --> 00:14:03.630 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And it was so well
researched and documented

00:14:03.630 --> 00:14:04.430 align:middle line:90%
at the time.

00:14:04.430 --> 00:14:07.510 align:middle line:84%
>>HARRIS: Right,
so what it served

00:14:07.510 --> 00:14:10.850 align:middle line:84%
to show that this
visitation really happened,

00:14:10.850 --> 00:14:13.520 align:middle line:84%
that we're being visited
by extraterrestrials.

00:14:13.520 --> 00:14:15.510 align:middle line:84%
And in this case,
they were kind enough

00:14:15.510 --> 00:14:16.900 align:middle line:90%
to put him back on the road.

00:14:16.900 --> 00:14:18.411 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right, clothed.

00:14:18.411 --> 00:14:20.720 align:middle line:90%
>>HARRIS: Clothed.

00:14:20.720 --> 00:14:23.450 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: OK, now another one--
thank you for sharing that.

00:14:23.450 --> 00:14:24.850 align:middle line:84%
I have interviewed
Travis Walton.

00:14:24.850 --> 00:14:27.707 align:middle line:84%
And so we get to hear it
from his perspective as well,

00:14:27.707 --> 00:14:30.040 align:middle line:84%
for anyone who chooses to
take a look at that interview.

00:14:30.040 --> 00:14:33.650 align:middle line:84%
And then did another
interview with Clifford Stone.

00:14:33.650 --> 00:14:34.730 align:middle line:90%
It's been awhile now.

00:14:34.730 --> 00:14:36.010 align:middle line:90%
And you know Clifford well.

00:14:36.010 --> 00:14:37.740 align:middle line:90%
You've published his work.

00:14:37.740 --> 00:14:41.392 align:middle line:84%
And we just had a short bit of
time with him a few years ago.

00:14:41.392 --> 00:14:43.600 align:middle line:84%
I would love for you to talk
about that, because that

00:14:43.600 --> 00:14:46.570 align:middle line:90%
was not documented.

00:14:46.570 --> 00:14:48.980 align:middle line:84%
>>HARRIS: No, the thing is
that as a journalist, all

00:14:48.980 --> 00:14:51.315 align:middle line:84%
my books-- the four
books I've written--

00:14:51.315 --> 00:14:53.940 align:middle line:84%
are all witness military,
military witness,

00:14:53.940 --> 00:14:56.630 align:middle line:90%
because they've credentials.

00:14:56.630 --> 00:14:59.037 align:middle line:90%
And they have no reason to lie.

00:14:59.037 --> 00:15:00.120 align:middle line:90%
And they're very credible.

00:15:00.120 --> 00:15:03.150 align:middle line:84%
And the way they express
themselves are very logical.

00:15:03.150 --> 00:15:05.001 align:middle line:90%
But Clifford is very emotional.

00:15:05.001 --> 00:15:06.250 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: He's very emotional.

00:15:06.250 --> 00:15:08.137 align:middle line:84%
He's a very sweet
man, very emotional.

00:15:08.137 --> 00:15:10.220 align:middle line:84%
>>HARRIS: Very emotional,
because you were present

00:15:10.220 --> 00:15:11.600 align:middle line:84%
at the Disclosure
Project, right?

00:15:11.600 --> 00:15:12.880 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes, I was.

00:15:12.880 --> 00:15:16.930 align:middle line:84%
>>HARRIS: Because the emotional
price some of these people pay

00:15:16.930 --> 00:15:18.392 align:middle line:90%
for secrecy.

00:15:18.392 --> 00:15:20.350 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: To me, that
was most interesting part

00:15:20.350 --> 00:15:23.140 align:middle line:84%
of being present for disclosure,
because I wasn't just sitting

00:15:23.140 --> 00:15:23.940 align:middle line:90%
in the audience.

00:15:23.940 --> 00:15:25.485 align:middle line:84%
I was actually part
of the crew that

00:15:25.485 --> 00:15:28.480 align:middle line:84%
was working with
all of the people

00:15:28.480 --> 00:15:31.050 align:middle line:84%
participating in
disclosure, the witnesses.

00:15:31.050 --> 00:15:36.030 align:middle line:84%
And the amount of trauma
that they held in them

00:15:36.030 --> 00:15:38.560 align:middle line:90%
came out in tears.

00:15:38.560 --> 00:15:40.030 align:middle line:90%
They were shaky.

00:15:40.030 --> 00:15:42.950 align:middle line:84%
Some of them were literally
in tears behind the scenes,

00:15:42.950 --> 00:15:46.400 align:middle line:84%
because they had held to
their national security oaths

00:15:46.400 --> 00:15:50.220 align:middle line:84%
for decades, kept this
information away from all

00:15:50.220 --> 00:15:51.280 align:middle line:90%
the people they loved.

00:15:51.280 --> 00:15:53.810 align:middle line:84%
And here, they're coming
in front of the media

00:15:53.810 --> 00:15:56.810 align:middle line:84%
at the National Press
Club, finally sharing

00:15:56.810 --> 00:15:58.140 align:middle line:90%
the events that had happened.

00:15:58.140 --> 00:16:01.030 align:middle line:90%
I mean, they were scared.

00:16:01.030 --> 00:16:04.560 align:middle line:84%
>>HARRIS: And this was
Doctor Steven Greer in 2001.

00:16:04.560 --> 00:16:06.320 align:middle line:84%
God bless him,
because I considered

00:16:06.320 --> 00:16:08.014 align:middle line:84%
him the best of the
best of the best.

00:16:08.014 --> 00:16:09.680 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: He did an
amazing job on that.

00:16:09.680 --> 00:16:12.750 align:middle line:84%
>>HARRIS: He did, and he's
very altruistic about it,

00:16:12.750 --> 00:16:14.490 align:middle line:84%
because I think
he, like me, wants

00:16:14.490 --> 00:16:17.220 align:middle line:84%
to leave some kind of
legacy of the truth.

00:16:17.220 --> 00:16:20.030 align:middle line:84%
And we all notice that
Clifford is the most emotional.

00:16:20.030 --> 00:16:21.290 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Of all.

00:16:21.290 --> 00:16:23.520 align:middle line:84%
>>HARRIS: Because
Clifford was involved

00:16:23.520 --> 00:16:27.830 align:middle line:84%
in the actual recovery of he
says live and dead aliens.

00:16:27.830 --> 00:16:31.770 align:middle line:84%
And they didn't tell him when
he had his first case in 1969

00:16:31.770 --> 00:16:34.280 align:middle line:84%
in Indiantown Gap,
Pennsylvania, what

00:16:34.280 --> 00:16:37.120 align:middle line:84%
he thought he was looking at
was a craff-- and not a craft,

00:16:37.120 --> 00:16:38.980 align:middle line:90%
an airplane that had crashed.

00:16:38.980 --> 00:16:40.940 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Yes, they
had recruited him

00:16:40.940 --> 00:16:43.790 align:middle line:84%
because he was known to have
some intuitive abilities.

00:16:43.790 --> 00:16:47.070 align:middle line:84%
They'd been keeping an eye
on him for a long time.

00:16:47.070 --> 00:16:48.455 align:middle line:90%
>>HARRIS: A long time.

00:16:48.455 --> 00:16:51.130 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: When he was
a kid, he was young.

00:16:51.130 --> 00:16:52.880 align:middle line:84%
They scouted him right
out of high school.

00:16:52.880 --> 00:16:54.296 align:middle line:84%
>>HARRIS: Right,
he shouldn't have

00:16:54.296 --> 00:16:56.470 align:middle line:84%
been in the army, because
physically he could

00:16:56.470 --> 00:16:57.680 align:middle line:90%
have gotten a deferment.

00:16:57.680 --> 00:16:59.990 align:middle line:84%
But they encouraged
him, because they

00:16:59.990 --> 00:17:02.220 align:middle line:84%
knew he had had contact
with this being called

00:17:02.220 --> 00:17:05.030 align:middle line:90%
Corona when he was very young.

00:17:05.030 --> 00:17:10.329 align:middle line:84%
And this colonel was
watching him, and so forth.

00:17:10.329 --> 00:17:13.329 align:middle line:84%
Which makes me wonder,
is there somebody

00:17:13.329 --> 00:17:15.839 align:middle line:90%
that knows who has contact?

00:17:15.839 --> 00:17:17.150 align:middle line:90%
And then they watch you?

00:17:17.150 --> 00:17:18.410 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: That's the
curious part of this.

00:17:18.410 --> 00:17:19.826 align:middle line:84%
He had been watched
for many years

00:17:19.826 --> 00:17:23.884 align:middle line:84%
before they approached
him to enlist,

00:17:23.884 --> 00:17:26.619 align:middle line:84%
not telling him what
he was actually doing.

00:17:26.619 --> 00:17:27.760 align:middle line:90%
So pick up the story.

00:17:27.760 --> 00:17:29.634 align:middle line:84%
>>HARRIS: So what happened
is that, you know,

00:17:29.634 --> 00:17:31.270 align:middle line:84%
I became good
friends with Cliff.

00:17:31.270 --> 00:17:33.740 align:middle line:84%
And I published his
book "Eyes Only,"

00:17:33.740 --> 00:17:36.320 align:middle line:84%
which actually has his
documents in it to prove,

00:17:36.320 --> 00:17:39.760 align:middle line:84%
because people that debunk
this say he was only a clerk.

00:17:39.760 --> 00:17:42.370 align:middle line:90%
Well, that's the way it appears.

00:17:42.370 --> 00:17:45.140 align:middle line:84%
But he told me
about his encounters

00:17:45.140 --> 00:17:50.740 align:middle line:90%
with the live beings in Vietnam.

00:17:50.740 --> 00:17:52.830 align:middle line:90%
And he talked about it to me.

00:17:52.830 --> 00:17:54.600 align:middle line:84%
He said, you know, I
was flown over there

00:17:54.600 --> 00:17:59.340 align:middle line:84%
with the group of other people
on a commercial airliner.

00:17:59.340 --> 00:18:01.570 align:middle line:84%
And we landed in
Vietnam, he said.

00:18:01.570 --> 00:18:04.430 align:middle line:84%
But the commercial
airliner was used.

00:18:04.430 --> 00:18:07.700 align:middle line:84%
But it was all of
us, the people that

00:18:07.700 --> 00:18:10.300 align:middle line:84%
were involved in
recovery, that went there,

00:18:10.300 --> 00:18:14.750 align:middle line:84%
because the beings were watching
us during the Vietnam War.

00:18:14.750 --> 00:18:17.550 align:middle line:84%
And in Clifford's
case, one of them

00:18:17.550 --> 00:18:21.750 align:middle line:84%
came up and said, what are
you doing here, Clifford?

00:18:21.750 --> 00:18:22.960 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: In Vietnam?

00:18:22.960 --> 00:18:23.835 align:middle line:90%
>>HARRIS: In Vietnam.

00:18:23.835 --> 00:18:26.260 align:middle line:90%


00:18:26.260 --> 00:18:28.560 align:middle line:84%
You know, I always ask,
what do they look like?

00:18:28.560 --> 00:18:29.360 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:18:29.360 --> 00:18:30.735 align:middle line:84%
>>HARRIS: And he
said, well, this

00:18:30.735 --> 00:18:32.340 align:middle line:90%
being looked almost amphibian.

00:18:32.340 --> 00:18:33.600 align:middle line:90%
He said, he had gills.

00:18:33.600 --> 00:18:35.090 align:middle line:90%
I said, you're kidding.

00:18:35.090 --> 00:18:39.670 align:middle line:84%
And he goes, Paolo, there are
57 different types of beings.

00:18:39.670 --> 00:18:42.140 align:middle line:84%
And they're not all Reptilian,
Pleiadian, and Greys.

00:18:42.140 --> 00:18:45.020 align:middle line:84%
Ian So that's our
ignorance level.

00:18:45.020 --> 00:18:49.060 align:middle line:84%
He said, this being looked very
amphibian, very intelligent.

00:18:49.060 --> 00:18:51.260 align:middle line:84%
He almost looked
like he had gills.

00:18:51.260 --> 00:18:58.190 align:middle line:84%
And they were looking at
our fighting in Vietnam.

00:18:58.190 --> 00:19:02.550 align:middle line:84%
And he said he got from the
being, why are you fighting?

00:19:02.550 --> 00:19:04.130 align:middle line:90%
And, of course--

00:19:04.130 --> 00:19:06.240 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: You can ask
Henry Kissinger that.

00:19:06.240 --> 00:19:09.480 align:middle line:84%
>>HARRIS: He said,
my first reaction

00:19:09.480 --> 00:19:12.510 align:middle line:84%
when I saw the being is take
the rifle and shoot at them.

00:19:12.510 --> 00:19:14.650 align:middle line:84%
He said it was everybody's
first reaction.

00:19:14.650 --> 00:19:16.902 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Sure, everybody
was in fighting mode.

00:19:16.902 --> 00:19:19.360 align:middle line:84%
>>HARRIS: Plus you're seeing
something you can't recognize.

00:19:19.360 --> 00:19:21.010 align:middle line:90%
It's like a monster.

00:19:21.010 --> 00:19:21.810 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Exactly.

00:19:21.810 --> 00:19:25.740 align:middle line:84%
>>HARRIS: And any he goes,
but Paolo, the bullets

00:19:25.740 --> 00:19:27.500 align:middle line:90%
didn't touch these people.

00:19:27.500 --> 00:19:28.740 align:middle line:90%
They didn't touch them.

00:19:28.740 --> 00:19:32.500 align:middle line:84%
So he said he had this
experience in Vietnam.

00:19:32.500 --> 00:19:34.990 align:middle line:84%
And that there are
portals they can

00:19:34.990 --> 00:19:37.820 align:middle line:84%
open in different
places for observation.

00:19:37.820 --> 00:19:40.050 align:middle line:84%
He said this had
happened in a cave.

00:19:40.050 --> 00:19:45.290 align:middle line:84%
And he told me also that he
was privy to an interrogation

00:19:45.290 --> 00:19:47.264 align:middle line:90%
of a being in the Pentagon.

00:19:47.264 --> 00:19:48.930 align:middle line:84%
And that's the one
he was talking about.

00:19:48.930 --> 00:19:52.550 align:middle line:84%
The being said-- and this
is really interesting.

00:19:52.550 --> 00:19:56.570 align:middle line:84%
Clifford, I am very
scared, and not for myself.

00:19:56.570 --> 00:19:59.830 align:middle line:84%
But if they come back to get
me, everybody here will die.

00:19:59.830 --> 00:20:02.910 align:middle line:84%
So it's better if you
tried to let me go.

00:20:02.910 --> 00:20:09.530 align:middle line:84%
And Clifford took, he said,
some kind of wire cutters

00:20:09.530 --> 00:20:11.220 align:middle line:84%
and let him go
through the fence.

00:20:11.220 --> 00:20:14.620 align:middle line:84%
And I think I understood
for the first time,

00:20:14.620 --> 00:20:16.420 align:middle line:84%
because I thought, you
know, he was scared.

00:20:16.420 --> 00:20:20.910 align:middle line:84%
You remember the testimonies,
the being said, I am scared.

00:20:20.910 --> 00:20:22.100 align:middle line:90%
I am just like you.

00:20:22.100 --> 00:20:22.900 align:middle line:90%
I am scared.

00:20:22.900 --> 00:20:25.060 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Oh yeah, it
makes him very emotional

00:20:25.060 --> 00:20:26.372 align:middle line:90%
to remember that.

00:20:26.372 --> 00:20:28.080 align:middle line:84%
>>HARRIS: Yeah, but
it's not because he's

00:20:28.080 --> 00:20:29.040 align:middle line:90%
scared he's going to be killed.

00:20:29.040 --> 00:20:31.680 align:middle line:84%
He's scared that all the people
that were interrogating him

00:20:31.680 --> 00:20:34.040 align:middle line:84%
would die, and everything,
because these people have

00:20:34.040 --> 00:20:39.050 align:middle line:84%
capabilities of these
ETs have capabilities

00:20:39.050 --> 00:20:41.550 align:middle line:90%
we can't even imagine.

00:20:41.550 --> 00:20:44.450 align:middle line:84%
And if you're keeping
one of their own,

00:20:44.450 --> 00:20:48.540 align:middle line:84%
you can imagine what the
repercussions of that are.

00:20:48.540 --> 00:20:50.400 align:middle line:84%
And Clifford
proceeded to tell me

00:20:50.400 --> 00:20:53.540 align:middle line:84%
that when there were
crashes, they came and got

00:20:53.540 --> 00:20:55.620 align:middle line:90%
the bodies of their own.

00:20:55.620 --> 00:20:56.900 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:20:56.900 --> 00:20:59.070 align:middle line:84%
>>HARRIS: So,
Regina, there should

00:20:59.070 --> 00:21:03.020 align:middle line:84%
be a whole study done on this,
because then you can't just

00:21:03.020 --> 00:21:05.080 align:middle line:84%
shove them into three
categories-- Reptilian,

00:21:05.080 --> 00:21:08.550 align:middle line:90%
Pleiadian, and Greys.

00:21:08.550 --> 00:21:12.090 align:middle line:84%
This was another type
of being that was there.

00:21:12.090 --> 00:21:14.160 align:middle line:84%
And then the Virginia
case in Brazil,

00:21:14.160 --> 00:21:17.160 align:middle line:84%
there was another type of
being, the little red being,

00:21:17.160 --> 00:21:22.930 align:middle line:84%
the one that was stuck in the
town where everybody saw him.

00:21:22.930 --> 00:21:25.640 align:middle line:84%
So we've got all these
different cosmic cultures

00:21:25.640 --> 00:21:27.660 align:middle line:90%
that nobody studies.

00:21:27.660 --> 00:21:29.820 align:middle line:84%
And we can't even
place them anywhere,

00:21:29.820 --> 00:21:32.830 align:middle line:84%
because in our mythology
in the United States,

00:21:32.830 --> 00:21:36.710 align:middle line:84%
they simplified it to the
fact that the stereotypical

00:21:36.710 --> 00:21:40.970 align:middle line:84%
commercial one is the grey
that you see all over Facebook,

00:21:40.970 --> 00:21:43.830 align:middle line:84%
which Colonel Corso told me was
the extraterrestrial biological

00:21:43.830 --> 00:21:45.030 align:middle line:90%
entity.

00:21:45.030 --> 00:21:47.800 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Right, we're going to
go to him, just for a moment,

00:21:47.800 --> 00:21:49.420 align:middle line:90%
to hop back to Clifford.

00:21:49.420 --> 00:21:53.070 align:middle line:84%
Clifford, he's had
a rough go of it.

00:21:53.070 --> 00:21:55.560 align:middle line:84%
He was a little too
sensitive to have been put

00:21:55.560 --> 00:21:57.650 align:middle line:90%
in such a vulnerable situation.

00:21:57.650 --> 00:22:02.160 align:middle line:84%
I mean, he was a security
guard, I think, for a long time,

00:22:02.160 --> 00:22:05.790 align:middle line:84%
and stayed in Roswell,
lived in Roswell,

00:22:05.790 --> 00:22:08.820 align:middle line:84%
just making a few bucks an
hour as a security guard.

00:22:08.820 --> 00:22:12.170 align:middle line:84%
And it really was
upsetting to me

00:22:12.170 --> 00:22:16.484 align:middle line:84%
to see people in this
community try to discredit him.

00:22:16.484 --> 00:22:17.900 align:middle line:84%
>>HARRIS: Because
of the emotions?

00:22:17.900 --> 00:22:20.830 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Yes, because
he's emotional.

00:22:20.830 --> 00:22:23.170 align:middle line:84%
>>HARRIS: That is
such a ridiculous--

00:22:23.170 --> 00:22:25.205 align:middle line:84%
if you stay with him for
long periods of time--

00:22:25.205 --> 00:22:28.390 align:middle line:84%
and because I did
his life story,

00:22:28.390 --> 00:22:31.190 align:middle line:90%
I saw the price his family paid.

00:22:31.190 --> 00:22:34.580 align:middle line:84%
He lost a son, you
know, a twin, Robert.

00:22:34.580 --> 00:22:37.860 align:middle line:84%
And it was not until Robert
died in a motorcycle accident

00:22:37.860 --> 00:22:39.209 align:middle line:90%
that Clifford came forth.

00:22:39.209 --> 00:22:40.500 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes, I remember that.

00:22:40.500 --> 00:22:42.416 align:middle line:84%
>>HARRIS: And his wife
is not exactly thrilled

00:22:42.416 --> 00:22:43.920 align:middle line:90%
with the UFO community.

00:22:43.920 --> 00:22:48.810 align:middle line:84%
And his whole entire family
has suffered greatly for this.

00:22:48.810 --> 00:22:51.340 align:middle line:90%
And these are, to me, heroes.

00:22:51.340 --> 00:22:53.570 align:middle line:84%
And they're whistleblowers,
but they're heroes,

00:22:53.570 --> 00:22:55.570 align:middle line:90%
because they live this reality.

00:22:55.570 --> 00:22:57.140 align:middle line:84%
And once you live
in this reality,

00:22:57.140 --> 00:23:00.672 align:middle line:84%
it's hard to come back
to the real world.

00:23:00.672 --> 00:23:02.380 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: First of
all, no one around you

00:23:02.380 --> 00:23:04.980 align:middle line:84%
will let you come back
to the real world.

00:23:04.980 --> 00:23:05.960 align:middle line:90%
It's kind of done.

00:23:05.960 --> 00:23:08.690 align:middle line:84%
>>HARRIS: So I've remained
good friends with him.

00:23:08.690 --> 00:23:10.110 align:middle line:90%
What does he do now?

00:23:10.110 --> 00:23:12.850 align:middle line:84%
He accumulates documents
to prove that what he lived

00:23:12.850 --> 00:23:13.650 align:middle line:90%
was real.

00:23:13.650 --> 00:23:16.330 align:middle line:84%
So he's got a room
full of documents

00:23:16.330 --> 00:23:18.495 align:middle line:84%
that he's able to
uncover to prove.

00:23:18.495 --> 00:23:19.370 align:middle line:90%
Isn't that something?

00:23:19.370 --> 00:23:24.260 align:middle line:90%
It's like wag the dog, the tail.

00:23:24.260 --> 00:23:26.391 align:middle line:84%
He lived this, and then he
has to prove he lied it.

00:23:26.391 --> 00:23:28.140 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: He deserves
a really beautifully

00:23:28.140 --> 00:23:31.670 align:middle line:84%
done documentary on
his experience in life.

00:23:31.670 --> 00:23:35.950 align:middle line:84%
OK, so now I wanted to also
talk about your relationship

00:23:35.950 --> 00:23:40.050 align:middle line:84%
with Phillip Corso,
speaking of Roswell.

00:23:40.050 --> 00:23:42.080 align:middle line:84%
>>HARRIS: Well,
logically, if we look

00:23:42.080 --> 00:23:45.970 align:middle line:84%
at this whole entire
situation, the turning

00:23:45.970 --> 00:23:48.530 align:middle line:84%
point-- I talked about
Travis Walton case, one

00:23:48.530 --> 00:23:52.860 align:middle line:84%
of the most important cases
of my-- now in my career,

00:23:52.860 --> 00:23:55.160 align:middle line:84%
because there are
points in my career

00:23:55.160 --> 00:23:57.640 align:middle line:84%
where I have lived
this situation.

00:23:57.640 --> 00:24:02.530 align:middle line:84%
And with colonel
Corso, it was a 1997.

00:24:02.530 --> 00:24:04.452 align:middle line:84%
By accident, I the
room next to Corso.

00:24:04.452 --> 00:24:06.160 align:middle line:84%
And I was sent from
Italy to cover story.

00:24:06.160 --> 00:24:07.784 align:middle line:84%
I didn't even know
what he looked like.

00:24:07.784 --> 00:24:09.860 align:middle line:84%
I was sent by my
boss, [INAUDIBLE],

00:24:09.860 --> 00:24:13.330 align:middle line:84%
to cover the 50th
anniversary historical event.

00:24:13.330 --> 00:24:18.080 align:middle line:84%
And I ended up, coincidentally,
in the room next to him

00:24:18.080 --> 00:24:20.830 align:middle line:84%
at the Sally Port Inn,
which was all booked.

00:24:20.830 --> 00:24:24.150 align:middle line:84%
And Coros talked to me
about his involvement

00:24:24.150 --> 00:24:27.180 align:middle line:84%
in back engineering
the Roswell technology.

00:24:27.180 --> 00:24:28.825 align:middle line:84%
Now, the people get
it all mixed up,

00:24:28.825 --> 00:24:30.570 align:middle line:90%
because he's never at Roswell.

00:24:30.570 --> 00:24:33.400 align:middle line:84%
He got the artifacts
in 1960 when

00:24:33.400 --> 00:24:36.330 align:middle line:84%
he was working in the Pentagon
in research and development.

00:24:36.330 --> 00:24:38.720 align:middle line:90%
He got them from General Trudot.

00:24:38.720 --> 00:24:41.550 align:middle line:84%
The deal was made
that the last one

00:24:41.550 --> 00:24:44.310 align:middle line:90%
living would tell the truth.

00:24:44.310 --> 00:24:47.760 align:middle line:84%
And the last living was Colonel
Philip Corso at 82 years ago.

00:24:47.760 --> 00:24:49.550 align:middle line:84%
And I asked him,
why did you do this?

00:24:49.550 --> 00:24:50.590 align:middle line:90%
Why did you come forth?

00:24:50.590 --> 00:24:53.480 align:middle line:84%
And he said, because young
people can handle it.

00:24:53.480 --> 00:24:55.560 align:middle line:90%
I did it for my three grandsons.

00:24:55.560 --> 00:24:57.730 align:middle line:84%
So the day after
Roswell that everybody

00:24:57.730 --> 00:24:59.930 align:middle line:84%
complains about
being, inaccurate

00:24:59.930 --> 00:25:01.900 align:middle line:90%
it was written by Bill Burns.

00:25:01.900 --> 00:25:06.045 align:middle line:84%
On the manuscript that
we got in Italy called

00:25:06.045 --> 00:25:10.870 align:middle line:84%
"The Dawning of a New
Age," when I met him,

00:25:10.870 --> 00:25:12.330 align:middle line:90%
we brought him to Italy.

00:25:12.330 --> 00:25:14.530 align:middle line:84%
We brought him on two
separate occasions

00:25:14.530 --> 00:25:18.060 align:middle line:84%
to speak, once at Piscotta,
one in the independent republic

00:25:18.060 --> 00:25:21.220 align:middle line:84%
of San Marino, where
he signed a paper

00:25:21.220 --> 00:25:24.320 align:middle line:84%
with a lot of other people
to go to the United Nations

00:25:24.320 --> 00:25:26.800 align:middle line:90%
to open up this case.

00:25:26.800 --> 00:25:30.950 align:middle line:84%
So Marino's independent
republic, like Grenada,

00:25:30.950 --> 00:25:33.950 align:middle line:84%
they can do it, because
they've got nothing to lose.

00:25:33.950 --> 00:25:36.610 align:middle line:90%
And right after that, he died.

00:25:36.610 --> 00:25:41.710 align:middle line:84%
And in his role was that
he came forth to say that--

00:25:41.710 --> 00:25:45.120 align:middle line:84%
and this is why I understood
that the secret was secret.

00:25:45.120 --> 00:25:49.910 align:middle line:84%
That he was given several
artifacts for the Army.

00:25:49.910 --> 00:25:52.380 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Yes, because each
of the branches of military

00:25:52.380 --> 00:25:55.190 align:middle line:84%
had been there, and had scooped
up their bits of debris.

00:25:55.190 --> 00:25:58.700 align:middle line:84%
>>HARRIS: Exactly, so
if it happened in '47.

00:25:58.700 --> 00:26:02.500 align:middle line:84%
the Air Force had sad
stuff way before 1960

00:26:02.500 --> 00:26:06.800 align:middle line:84%
that was leaked into
the general public.

00:26:06.800 --> 00:26:11.310 align:middle line:84%
But Corso talked about the
high tenacity fibers, the fiber

00:26:11.310 --> 00:26:14.350 align:middle line:84%
optics, the transistor,
the laser, and so forth,

00:26:14.350 --> 00:26:15.910 align:middle line:90%
that he was given.

00:26:15.910 --> 00:26:17.550 align:middle line:84%
And he said there
was no paper trail,

00:26:17.550 --> 00:26:19.080 align:middle line:84%
because he used to
go with envelopes

00:26:19.080 --> 00:26:21.297 align:middle line:90%
full of money to these--

00:26:21.297 --> 00:26:23.130 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: These are big
military contractors

00:26:23.130 --> 00:26:24.880 align:middle line:84%
that they were
parting this out to,

00:26:24.880 --> 00:26:27.540 align:middle line:84%
who would come out with a
patent or something later.

00:26:27.540 --> 00:26:30.310 align:middle line:84%
>>HARRIS: Yeah, but
it was like Monsanto.

00:26:30.310 --> 00:26:34.320 align:middle line:84%
The people with-- whatever,
he said the American computer

00:26:34.320 --> 00:26:35.190 align:middle line:90%
company.

00:26:35.190 --> 00:26:36.500 align:middle line:90%
He talked about these--

00:26:36.500 --> 00:26:39.160 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Wasn't the labs
involved in the development

00:26:39.160 --> 00:26:40.480 align:middle line:90%
of the transistor?

00:26:40.480 --> 00:26:45.660 align:middle line:84%
>>HARRIS: He said, but they knew
they were army contracts, it

00:26:45.660 --> 00:26:52.610 align:middle line:84%
because they were told the copy
it, and give it, number one,

00:26:52.610 --> 00:26:55.380 align:middle line:84%
to the army, not to
any other branch,

00:26:55.380 --> 00:26:58.730 align:middle line:84%
and then the, number two, to put
it out into the general public.

00:26:58.730 --> 00:27:01.670 align:middle line:84%
And when you think of that,
there's money involved here.

00:27:01.670 --> 00:27:08.030 align:middle line:84%
So if we have a buy-in
of huge corporations,

00:27:08.030 --> 00:27:10.670 align:middle line:84%
nobody's going to
talk about this.

00:27:10.670 --> 00:27:12.570 align:middle line:90%
Nobody's going to admit it.

00:27:12.570 --> 00:27:15.110 align:middle line:84%
And the money and
the, technology,

00:27:15.110 --> 00:27:18.300 align:middle line:84%
which is the secret to
all of us not, the beings,

00:27:18.300 --> 00:27:20.810 align:middle line:84%
is what's keeping
this under wraps.

00:27:20.810 --> 00:27:24.380 align:middle line:84%
And not so much something like
high tenacity fibers, or even

00:27:24.380 --> 00:27:27.650 align:middle line:84%
fiber optics, what's
keeping it under wraps

00:27:27.650 --> 00:27:30.660 align:middle line:84%
is the free energy
situation, the idea

00:27:30.660 --> 00:27:33.840 align:middle line:84%
that these things don't use
gas and oil to fly around.

00:27:33.840 --> 00:27:38.140 align:middle line:84%
So until whoever
decides to release that

00:27:38.140 --> 00:27:42.450 align:middle line:84%
into the general
public, this UFO study

00:27:42.450 --> 00:27:44.220 align:middle line:90%
will be considered fringe.

00:27:44.220 --> 00:27:48.020 align:middle line:90%
It'll be considered not viable.

00:27:48.020 --> 00:27:49.570 align:middle line:90%
People and will it.

00:27:49.570 --> 00:27:57.930 align:middle line:84%
And they'll keep it in
the box of craziness,

00:27:57.930 --> 00:28:01.200 align:middle line:84%
because if the
general public really

00:28:01.200 --> 00:28:05.790 align:middle line:84%
understands about the
recoveries, and the crashes.

00:28:05.790 --> 00:28:08.380 align:middle line:84%
Roswell, as you know,
was not the only one.

00:28:08.380 --> 00:28:10.770 align:middle line:84%
We've had crashes
in other countries,

00:28:10.770 --> 00:28:14.040 align:middle line:90%
like Brazil, even in Italy.

00:28:14.040 --> 00:28:18.740 align:middle line:84%
We can't talk about
it in a serious vane.

00:28:18.740 --> 00:28:23.327 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Right, the thing
is-- I really don't understand.

00:28:23.327 --> 00:28:24.910 align:middle line:84%
And I know this was
a big part of what

00:28:24.910 --> 00:28:26.830 align:middle line:90%
Stephen Greer was trying to do.

00:28:26.830 --> 00:28:29.610 align:middle line:84%
He was trying to really
get the free energy

00:28:29.610 --> 00:28:33.890 align:middle line:84%
technology protected, and
forwarded, and so forth.

00:28:33.890 --> 00:28:36.360 align:middle line:84%
And along with a
lot of other, people

00:28:36.360 --> 00:28:38.790 align:middle line:90%
many people have been on this.

00:28:38.790 --> 00:28:42.120 align:middle line:84%
We know that a lot of these
back-engineered technologies,

00:28:42.120 --> 00:28:45.680 align:middle line:84%
such as that kind of
flight that doesn't require

00:28:45.680 --> 00:28:47.910 align:middle line:84%
any kind of fuels,
that's been worked

00:28:47.910 --> 00:28:51.730 align:middle line:84%
on at Los Alamos for years,
plasma technology, all of that.

00:28:51.730 --> 00:28:54.610 align:middle line:84%
And even Mark McCandlish
of his drawings

00:28:54.610 --> 00:28:56.690 align:middle line:84%
of the back-engineered
craft that

00:28:56.690 --> 00:28:59.130 align:middle line:84%
were sitting in a
hangar near Area 51 too.

00:28:59.130 --> 00:29:01.530 align:middle line:84%
>>HARRIS: And Bob
Lazar, same thing.

00:29:01.530 --> 00:29:03.620 align:middle line:84%
They say these
things decades ago,

00:29:03.620 --> 00:29:07.440 align:middle line:84%
we had already back
engineered spacecraft.

00:29:07.440 --> 00:29:09.350 align:middle line:90%
What's the problem?

00:29:09.350 --> 00:29:11.050 align:middle line:10%
>>HARRIS: Well, what
happened in 2009,

00:29:11.050 --> 00:29:14.260 align:middle line:10%
which is really interesting
because I'm a journalist,

00:29:14.260 --> 00:29:17.730 align:middle line:10%
was that in Riad there was
an economic conference.

00:29:17.730 --> 00:29:20.580 align:middle line:10%
And they invited Stanton
Friedman, Michio Kaku,

00:29:20.580 --> 00:29:23.330 align:middle line:10%
Nick Pope, and
Jacque Valey to and

00:29:23.330 --> 00:29:26.250 align:middle line:10%
economic-- the Arabs
invited them in Riyadh

00:29:26.250 --> 00:29:27.700 align:middle line:10%
to an economic conference.

00:29:27.700 --> 00:29:30.130 align:middle line:84%
And God bless them, Stanton
Friedman stood up and said,

00:29:30.130 --> 00:29:30.930 align:middle line:90%
UFOs are real.

00:29:30.930 --> 00:29:34.630 align:middle line:84%
What are those guys
doing in Saudi Arabia,

00:29:34.630 --> 00:29:37.590 align:middle line:90%
talking about what?

00:29:37.590 --> 00:29:39.990 align:middle line:84%
With these people that
are working with oil.

00:29:39.990 --> 00:29:42.115 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: They must have
access to this technology.

00:29:42.115 --> 00:29:44.490 align:middle line:84%
>>HARRIS: Yes, because
they were special guests.

00:29:44.490 --> 00:29:45.720 align:middle line:90%
Why would you oil people?

00:29:45.720 --> 00:29:48.140 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And they have a
lot of money to develop with.

00:29:48.140 --> 00:29:48.940 align:middle line:90%
>>HARRIS: Exactly.

00:29:48.940 --> 00:29:50.350 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So what's
going on over there?

00:29:50.350 --> 00:29:52.016 align:middle line:84%
>>HARRIS: So what's
going on over there?

00:29:52.016 --> 00:29:53.530 align:middle line:90%
And this is 2009.

00:29:53.530 --> 00:29:56.170 align:middle line:84%
I'm thinking, what are
they doing inviting

00:29:56.170 --> 00:29:58.700 align:middle line:90%
a ufologist to their economic.

00:29:58.700 --> 00:29:59.870 align:middle line:90%
Situation.

00:29:59.870 --> 00:30:02.050 align:middle line:84%
So maybe-- [INAUDIBLE]
told me this

00:30:02.050 --> 00:30:03.810 align:middle line:90%
because he's a geophysicist.

00:30:03.810 --> 00:30:07.409 align:middle line:84%
He said, Paulo until
every drop of oil is--

00:30:07.409 --> 00:30:09.700 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: They're going to
exploit it to the last drop.

00:30:09.700 --> 00:30:11.770 align:middle line:84%
And then they have
to come up a the plan

00:30:11.770 --> 00:30:14.815 align:middle line:90%
to make you pay for free energy.

00:30:14.815 --> 00:30:16.690 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: I'm sure that's
all there is to it,

00:30:16.690 --> 00:30:19.420 align:middle line:90%
is until you can harness it.

00:30:19.420 --> 00:30:20.420 align:middle line:90%
>>HARRIS: Gonna be free.

00:30:20.420 --> 00:30:23.180 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: This part is just
so dastardly, it's depressing,

00:30:23.180 --> 00:30:25.760 align:middle line:84%
because these energy problems
would have been solved decades

00:30:25.760 --> 00:30:27.700 align:middle line:90%
ago if anybody had allowed it.

00:30:27.700 --> 00:30:30.612 align:middle line:84%
So here we are, still
trying to hide it.

00:30:30.612 --> 00:30:33.070 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: I hope in our lifetime
we'll see this transition.

00:30:33.070 --> 00:30:36.040 align:middle line:90%


00:30:36.040 --> 00:30:38.470 align:middle line:84%
It's not only an
economic transition.

00:30:38.470 --> 00:30:41.230 align:middle line:84%
It's a transition in every which
way, because it would mean we

00:30:41.230 --> 00:30:43.120 align:middle line:90%
could travel among the stars.

00:30:43.120 --> 00:30:44.160 align:middle line:90%
And that would be great.

00:30:44.160 --> 00:30:48.130 align:middle line:84%
And meanwhile, the people of the
stars are traveling among us.

00:30:48.130 --> 00:30:49.680 align:middle line:84%
Let's talk about
some other phenomena

00:30:49.680 --> 00:30:53.120 align:middle line:84%
that I know you've reported
on, and so has Jaime Maussan.

00:30:53.120 --> 00:30:56.020 align:middle line:84%
And that is, they're
showing up that air bases,

00:30:56.020 --> 00:30:58.750 align:middle line:84%
and well at airports,
around the world, UFOs.

00:30:58.750 --> 00:31:02.490 align:middle line:84%
There have been some series
of airport shut downs

00:31:02.490 --> 00:31:04.350 align:middle line:90%
as a result of it.

00:31:04.350 --> 00:31:07.665 align:middle line:84%
One was-- I think you're the
one that told me, New Delhi.

00:31:07.665 --> 00:31:10.030 align:middle line:84%
>>HARRIS: Yeah,
November 4, the airport

00:31:10.030 --> 00:31:11.340 align:middle line:90%
is shut down because of UFOs.

00:31:11.340 --> 00:31:12.680 align:middle line:90%
It's in all the newspapers.

00:31:12.680 --> 00:31:14.390 align:middle line:90%
And we even got it here.

00:31:14.390 --> 00:31:17.900 align:middle line:84%
I mean don't people, pay
attention to things like that?

00:31:17.900 --> 00:31:20.910 align:middle line:84%
So and why are they
over in New, Delhi

00:31:20.910 --> 00:31:23.590 align:middle line:90%
and then in Beijing, China.

00:31:23.590 --> 00:31:25.470 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: There
are a rash of them.

00:31:25.470 --> 00:31:27.660 align:middle line:84%
>>HARRIS: Yeah, nine
times this year.

00:31:27.660 --> 00:31:30.990 align:middle line:84%
Italy, when I lived
there, [INAUDIBLE]

00:31:30.990 --> 00:31:36.850 align:middle line:84%
we had a blue-green orb that
was close to the tarmac.

00:31:36.850 --> 00:31:38.370 align:middle line:90%
And they shut down there.

00:31:38.370 --> 00:31:43.980 align:middle line:84%
And the one in Bremen,
Germany in 2012 not

00:31:43.980 --> 00:31:46.540 align:middle line:84%
only shut down the
airport in Bremen,

00:31:46.540 --> 00:31:48.260 align:middle line:84%
but it went over
a soccer stadium.

00:31:48.260 --> 00:31:49.990 align:middle line:90%
So the game had to stop.

00:31:49.990 --> 00:31:51.740 align:middle line:84%
And how did I find
out about that?

00:31:51.740 --> 00:31:53.600 align:middle line:84%
In a soccer magazine,
because it didn't

00:31:53.600 --> 00:31:55.260 align:middle line:90%
appear in the United States.

00:31:55.260 --> 00:31:58.844 align:middle line:84%
So the soccer magazine said that
it interrupted a soccer game.

00:31:58.844 --> 00:32:00.760 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Wow, well at
least it made the news.

00:32:00.760 --> 00:32:03.070 align:middle line:84%
And then the recent thing
over LA, everybody's saying,

00:32:03.070 --> 00:32:03.870 align:middle line:90%
is it a missile?

00:32:03.870 --> 00:32:04.900 align:middle line:90%
Is it a UFO?

00:32:04.900 --> 00:32:05.410 align:middle line:84%
>>HARRIS: Oh, that is
the weirdest thing.

00:32:05.410 --> 00:32:07.560 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: That was interesting,
because apparently LAX

00:32:07.560 --> 00:32:08.400 align:middle line:90%
was informed.

00:32:08.400 --> 00:32:10.524 align:middle line:84%
And there was some disturbance
there to air traffic

00:32:10.524 --> 00:32:13.050 align:middle line:84%
beforehand, which
was interesting,

00:32:13.050 --> 00:32:18.480 align:middle line:84%
because that has-- I mean,
as everybody in that field

00:32:18.480 --> 00:32:21.800 align:middle line:84%
understands, you don't just
shoot wild missiles like that

00:32:21.800 --> 00:32:25.220 align:middle line:84%
over populated areas across
the Western United States.

00:32:25.220 --> 00:32:26.040 align:middle line:90%
You don't do that.

00:32:26.040 --> 00:32:28.125 align:middle line:84%
>>HARRIS: We saw it in Arizona
when I was at the Travis

00:32:28.125 --> 00:32:28.730 align:middle line:90%
Walton--

00:32:28.730 --> 00:32:30.260 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: I was having
a party that night.

00:32:30.260 --> 00:32:32.750 align:middle line:84%
And three of the people on
the way to the party, saw It.

00:32:32.750 --> 00:32:36.860 align:middle line:84%
And then Scott, my ex, was
on the beach at Stinson Beach

00:32:36.860 --> 00:32:38.410 align:middle line:90%
Northern California.

00:32:38.410 --> 00:32:40.750 align:middle line:90%
He saw it for several minutes.

00:32:40.750 --> 00:32:42.430 align:middle line:84%
Several minutes--
you know, missiles

00:32:42.430 --> 00:32:45.730 align:middle line:84%
travel at 15,000 miles
an hour, 13 to 15.

00:32:45.730 --> 00:32:49.580 align:middle line:90%
It was really quite interesting.

00:32:49.580 --> 00:32:52.460 align:middle line:84%
Again, this whole notion of
missiles and weather balloons

00:32:52.460 --> 00:32:54.150 align:middle line:90%
really hasn't gone away yet.

00:32:54.150 --> 00:32:56.080 align:middle line:90%
>>HARRIS: No, what about O'Hare?

00:32:56.080 --> 00:32:58.230 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And the one in
O'Hare a few years ago.

00:32:58.230 --> 00:33:01.160 align:middle line:84%
>>HARRIS: Over the United
Airline Terminal, C17.

00:33:01.160 --> 00:33:02.480 align:middle line:90%
I've been there.

00:33:02.480 --> 00:33:05.630 align:middle line:84%
I went right there to see
that, because the pilots

00:33:05.630 --> 00:33:08.500 align:middle line:84%
took pictures of That
as they're coming down.

00:33:08.500 --> 00:33:11.032 align:middle line:84%
So I'm wondering, people
say, why don't they

00:33:11.032 --> 00:33:12.240 align:middle line:90%
land on the white house lawn.

00:33:12.240 --> 00:33:15.230 align:middle line:84%
Well, they're
landing at airports.

00:33:15.230 --> 00:33:19.320 align:middle line:90%


00:33:19.320 --> 00:33:22.530 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: OK, now I want
to go to South America.

00:33:22.530 --> 00:33:26.150 align:middle line:84%
A lot going on there, some
really beautiful people,

00:33:26.150 --> 00:33:28.530 align:middle line:90%
much more open minded.

00:33:28.530 --> 00:33:31.210 align:middle line:84%
The governments themselves
are more open minded.

00:33:31.210 --> 00:33:35.710 align:middle line:84%
Mexico, Jaime Maussan, they
have national television shows

00:33:35.710 --> 00:33:39.210 align:middle line:84%
featuring UFOs and
other phenomena,

00:33:39.210 --> 00:33:40.960 align:middle line:84%
unlike the United
States that still

00:33:40.960 --> 00:33:43.210 align:middle line:84%
likes to use the claim of
things like weather balloons

00:33:43.210 --> 00:33:45.450 align:middle line:84%
and missiles for our
own paranoid reasons.

00:33:45.450 --> 00:33:47.860 align:middle line:84%
>>HARRIS: Yeah, now I
got to Latin America

00:33:47.860 --> 00:33:49.450 align:middle line:84%
was that I realized,
first of all,

00:33:49.450 --> 00:33:51.850 align:middle line:84%
I started researching
human type aliens.

00:33:51.850 --> 00:33:54.060 align:middle line:84%
And human means people
that look like us.

00:33:54.060 --> 00:33:59.260 align:middle line:84%
And we had a series with Howard
Menger, George Van Tassel

00:33:59.260 --> 00:34:01.370 align:middle line:90%
and Adamski in 1950 an 60.

00:34:01.370 --> 00:34:03.910 align:middle line:90%
I mean, this was a Cold War.

00:34:03.910 --> 00:34:07.430 align:middle line:84%
And we had Orthon
coming to Adamski.

00:34:07.430 --> 00:34:08.480 align:middle line:90%
We have his footprints.

00:34:08.480 --> 00:34:12.900 align:middle line:84%
So George Hunt Williamson
actually took his shoe print.

00:34:12.900 --> 00:34:14.620 align:middle line:84%
And we have all these
people warning us

00:34:14.620 --> 00:34:16.920 align:middle line:90%
about the nuclear situation.

00:34:16.920 --> 00:34:18.170 align:middle line:90%
And then it stops.

00:34:18.170 --> 00:34:19.965 align:middle line:84%
Then we get into the
abduction scenario.

00:34:19.965 --> 00:34:21.670 align:middle line:90%
And we haven't gotten out of it.

00:34:21.670 --> 00:34:24.250 align:middle line:84%
And I thought, well,
whoa, this is being

00:34:24.250 --> 00:34:26.469 align:middle line:90%
micromanaged this information.

00:34:26.469 --> 00:34:28.920 align:middle line:84%
So I began looking
at Six Topaz Wells

00:34:28.920 --> 00:34:32.230 align:middle line:90%
at all of the around Peru.

00:34:32.230 --> 00:34:37.400 align:middle line:84%
Peru is the place that
I started to question.

00:34:37.400 --> 00:34:44.120 align:middle line:84%
And I began to interview Sixto
Paz, Ricardo Gonzales, Lewis

00:34:44.120 --> 00:34:46.340 align:middle line:90%
Fernando Mustacio from Bolivia.

00:34:46.340 --> 00:34:48.840 align:middle line:84%
And then contact these
in South America.

00:34:48.840 --> 00:34:51.960 align:middle line:84%
And, basically, they're
meeting with human type

00:34:51.960 --> 00:34:56.260 align:middle line:84%
beings who are coming right off
the ship and talking to them.

00:34:56.260 --> 00:34:58.750 align:middle line:84%
I mean, something
very normal, because I

00:34:58.750 --> 00:35:01.700 align:middle line:84%
think that you can't
really have a connection

00:35:01.700 --> 00:35:04.310 align:middle line:84%
with an extraterrestrial
on a mental level

00:35:04.310 --> 00:35:06.690 align:middle line:90%
because they're quite evolved.

00:35:06.690 --> 00:35:11.030 align:middle line:84%
But you can on a heart
level, I call it corazon.

00:35:11.030 --> 00:35:13.870 align:middle line:84%
And the biggest hearts, I
think, are in Latin America.

00:35:13.870 --> 00:35:17.890 align:middle line:84%
People will connect to you
if you're an extraterrestrial

00:35:17.890 --> 00:35:19.270 align:middle line:90%
on the heart level.

00:35:19.270 --> 00:35:22.280 align:middle line:84%
And so I began to
interview them.

00:35:22.280 --> 00:35:25.490 align:middle line:84%
Enrique Villanova is one
of my last interviews.

00:35:25.490 --> 00:35:27.550 align:middle line:90%
He lives in San Fernando Valley.

00:35:27.550 --> 00:35:32.044 align:middle line:84%
And it was amazing how he
said his contact began.

00:35:32.044 --> 00:35:33.460 align:middle line:84%
And I'm glad you're
having him on,

00:35:33.460 --> 00:35:37.530 align:middle line:84%
because not only did Sixto
Paz and Ricardo Gonzales,

00:35:37.530 --> 00:35:40.270 align:middle line:84%
but Enrique told me, it
begins with meditation.

00:35:40.270 --> 00:35:42.920 align:middle line:84%
It begins with
liberating the mind

00:35:42.920 --> 00:35:45.190 align:middle line:84%
so that you can
leave space in there

00:35:45.190 --> 00:35:48.500 align:middle line:84%
for the extraterrestrial
to speak to you.

00:35:48.500 --> 00:35:51.550 align:middle line:84%
And he said it began
with him, asking

00:35:51.550 --> 00:35:53.040 align:middle line:90%
is there anybody out there?

00:35:53.040 --> 00:35:54.480 align:middle line:90%
I could use a friend.

00:35:54.480 --> 00:35:56.661 align:middle line:90%
And then the phone rings.

00:35:56.661 --> 00:35:58.896 align:middle line:84%
And I said, physically
the phone rang?

00:35:58.896 --> 00:36:00.480 align:middle line:90%
And he said, yes.

00:36:00.480 --> 00:36:03.090 align:middle line:84%
He said, if you are
in that space where

00:36:03.090 --> 00:36:06.970 align:middle line:84%
you ask with a pure heart
without ulterior motives,

00:36:06.970 --> 00:36:09.240 align:middle line:84%
and you want to
know they are there,

00:36:09.240 --> 00:36:11.520 align:middle line:84%
and they will give
you the answer.

00:36:11.520 --> 00:36:14.505 align:middle line:84%
And so in Enquires
case, he had contact.

00:36:14.505 --> 00:36:19.300 align:middle line:84%
And he belonged to the
group of Sixto Paz Wells.

00:36:19.300 --> 00:36:21.710 align:middle line:84%
They used to go out
into the desert.

00:36:21.710 --> 00:36:24.060 align:middle line:84%
And, of course,
people can't do this.

00:36:24.060 --> 00:36:25.940 align:middle line:90%
But they'd fast for seven days.

00:36:25.940 --> 00:36:28.800 align:middle line:84%
They'd sleep in tents,
and prepare themselves

00:36:28.800 --> 00:36:31.752 align:middle line:84%
on an esoteric level,
on a vibrational level,

00:36:31.752 --> 00:36:32.960 align:middle line:90%
to have that kind of contact.

00:36:32.960 --> 00:36:34.390 align:middle line:84%
I mean, you're not
gong to have contact

00:36:34.390 --> 00:36:36.670 align:middle line:84%
when you're going to work,
and you're having a coffee,

00:36:36.670 --> 00:36:39.060 align:middle line:84%
and you're worried about
your bills, and everything.

00:36:39.060 --> 00:36:41.620 align:middle line:84%
That's not a
conduit for contact.

00:36:41.620 --> 00:36:44.590 align:middle line:84%
You're going to have it
when you prepare for it,

00:36:44.590 --> 00:36:46.090 align:middle line:90%
and the being knows.

00:36:46.090 --> 00:36:50.150 align:middle line:84%
I mean, even when I used to do
the CE5s with Dr. Steven Grier,

00:36:50.150 --> 00:36:53.820 align:middle line:84%
he used to do the Puja ceremony
in Sanskrit before we even

00:36:53.820 --> 00:36:54.620 align:middle line:90%
began.

00:36:54.620 --> 00:36:58.020 align:middle line:84%
And we were out there six days
until 2:00 in the morning.

00:36:58.020 --> 00:37:00.980 align:middle line:84%
And we didn't ask them to
play tricks and appear over

00:37:00.980 --> 00:37:01.780 align:middle line:90%
our heads.

00:37:01.780 --> 00:37:06.980 align:middle line:84%
What we wanted was, and what
everybody wants, is contact.

00:37:06.980 --> 00:37:09.950 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So this
brings us to-- we

00:37:09.950 --> 00:37:12.370 align:middle line:84%
won't go too much into
Enrique because he'll

00:37:12.370 --> 00:37:14.409 align:middle line:84%
tell his own story,
just to set up

00:37:14.409 --> 00:37:15.700 align:middle line:90%
that we will be talking to him.

00:37:15.700 --> 00:37:19.470 align:middle line:84%
But let's go into Ricardo
Gonzalez and his work.

00:37:19.470 --> 00:37:20.970 align:middle line:84%
>>HARRIS: Well,
Ricardo Gonzales was

00:37:20.970 --> 00:37:24.720 align:middle line:84%
one of the many-- actually
seven-- of the interviews

00:37:24.720 --> 00:37:25.520 align:middle line:90%
I did.

00:37:25.520 --> 00:37:28.490 align:middle line:84%
And this wasn't easy, because
I don't speak Spanish.

00:37:28.490 --> 00:37:30.420 align:middle line:90%
And they all speak Spanish.

00:37:30.420 --> 00:37:32.730 align:middle line:84%
And so I had to get
Georgia [INAUDIBLE]

00:37:32.730 --> 00:37:33.690 align:middle line:90%
to be the interpreter.

00:37:33.690 --> 00:37:39.570 align:middle line:84%
And we do half screen Skype,
the interpreter and the person.

00:37:39.570 --> 00:37:42.100 align:middle line:84%
And Ricardo told me that
when he was very young, when

00:37:42.100 --> 00:37:45.610 align:middle line:84%
he was 20 years old, he was
pharmaceutical representative.

00:37:45.610 --> 00:37:47.640 align:middle line:84%
But he would
practice meditation,

00:37:47.640 --> 00:37:51.560 align:middle line:84%
and once he got a message, come
to the balcony of your home,

00:37:51.560 --> 00:37:52.940 align:middle line:90%
because we're flying over.

00:37:52.940 --> 00:37:55.540 align:middle line:84%
And he said he went,
and his family went.

00:37:55.540 --> 00:37:57.770 align:middle line:90%
And How the contact began.

00:37:57.770 --> 00:38:02.390 align:middle line:84%
He said it he began with
a being called Anterel.

00:38:02.390 --> 00:38:06.380 align:middle line:84%
And he said, Paola, if you study
the history of Peru, people

00:38:06.380 --> 00:38:10.280 align:middle line:84%
from Apu, in the constellation
of Alpha Centauri

00:38:10.280 --> 00:38:12.890 align:middle line:84%
have been visiting
Peru for a long time.

00:38:12.890 --> 00:38:13.920 align:middle line:90%
And they look like us.

00:38:13.920 --> 00:38:19.020 align:middle line:84%
And they've given us advice,
especially during construction

00:38:19.020 --> 00:38:22.000 align:middle line:84%
on earthquakes, on different
things that have happened.

00:38:22.000 --> 00:38:26.190 align:middle line:84%
And he said, Anterel
says that he is from Apu.

00:38:26.190 --> 00:38:29.000 align:middle line:84%
He says he is here
to contact people.

00:38:29.000 --> 00:38:32.710 align:middle line:84%
And in Ricardo's life--
he's in his '40s now--

00:38:32.710 --> 00:38:36.990 align:middle line:84%
he's seen Anterel eight
times, only eight times.

00:38:36.990 --> 00:38:40.880 align:middle line:84%
And the physical being,
it's always a preparation.

00:38:40.880 --> 00:38:43.650 align:middle line:84%
He's always nervous,
because it's not normal.

00:38:43.650 --> 00:38:46.760 align:middle line:84%
I mean, it's really hard,
because as beautiful as Anterel

00:38:46.760 --> 00:38:48.990 align:middle line:90%
is, he's 10 foot tall.

00:38:48.990 --> 00:38:50.790 align:middle line:90%
And he's got blond hair.

00:38:50.790 --> 00:38:53.700 align:middle line:84%
And Ricardo said he has
honey-colored eyes, which

00:38:53.700 --> 00:38:54.500 align:middle line:90%
means brown.

00:38:54.500 --> 00:38:57.180 align:middle line:90%
Eyes so he's not a Pleidian.

00:38:57.180 --> 00:38:59.180 align:middle line:84%
We've got to get off of
the stereotypical thing.

00:38:59.180 --> 00:39:00.138 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: No blue eyes.

00:39:00.138 --> 00:39:01.140 align:middle line:90%
>>HARRIS: No blue eyes.

00:39:01.140 --> 00:39:03.210 align:middle line:90%
And he's a man.

00:39:03.210 --> 00:39:06.590 align:middle line:84%
And he said, he looks like
he came out of the gym.

00:39:06.590 --> 00:39:11.180 align:middle line:84%
And he is very any as
real very real message.

00:39:11.180 --> 00:39:14.210 align:middle line:84%
And the message is
that the human species

00:39:14.210 --> 00:39:19.300 align:middle line:84%
needs to unite in order
to have real contact.

00:39:19.300 --> 00:39:23.000 align:middle line:84%
And that needs to ask for
help, because we are coming

00:39:23.000 --> 00:39:27.220 align:middle line:90%
on some very tense times.

00:39:27.220 --> 00:39:30.150 align:middle line:84%
And I don't even want
to talk about what's

00:39:30.150 --> 00:39:31.040 align:middle line:90%
happening in Paris.

00:39:31.040 --> 00:39:34.320 align:middle line:84%
And that's why I'm wearing this
shirt, and everywhere else.

00:39:34.320 --> 00:39:36.350 align:middle line:84%
So we have some
serious decisions

00:39:36.350 --> 00:39:39.460 align:middle line:84%
to make in the name
of humanity, and not

00:39:39.460 --> 00:39:43.010 align:middle line:84%
in the name of
individual countries,

00:39:43.010 --> 00:39:45.750 align:middle line:84%
because it's borders
that are separating us.

00:39:45.750 --> 00:39:48.570 align:middle line:90%
So that is contact.

00:39:48.570 --> 00:39:50.850 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And,
Anterel, he has is only

00:39:50.850 --> 00:39:52.400 align:middle line:90%
seen him physically eight times.

00:39:52.400 --> 00:39:54.500 align:middle line:84%
But hasn't he communicated
with him a lot outside?

00:39:54.500 --> 00:39:56.340 align:middle line:84%
>>HARRIS: Yes, I saw
how that happened,

00:39:56.340 --> 00:39:59.910 align:middle line:84%
because there is
a video of Ricardo

00:39:59.910 --> 00:40:02.670 align:middle line:84%
that I left with
you at [INAUDIBLE].

00:40:02.670 --> 00:40:07.070 align:middle line:84%
And how that happens is there's
a preparation with mantra

00:40:07.070 --> 00:40:08.390 align:middle line:90%
for at least an hour.

00:40:08.390 --> 00:40:10.400 align:middle line:90%
I mean, it takes a long time.

00:40:10.400 --> 00:40:13.470 align:middle line:84%
And then Ricardo start
automatic writing.

00:40:13.470 --> 00:40:16.120 align:middle line:84%
He gets the message
from Anterel after gets

00:40:16.120 --> 00:40:18.260 align:middle line:90%
to that vibrational point.

00:40:18.260 --> 00:40:21.650 align:middle line:84%
And you have the video
[INAUDIBLE] at the [INAUDIBLE].

00:40:21.650 --> 00:40:23.970 align:middle line:84%
And as he's writing,
he goes, look up.

00:40:23.970 --> 00:40:25.140 align:middle line:90%
And there he was.

00:40:25.140 --> 00:40:26.420 align:middle line:90%
There was the ship.

00:40:26.420 --> 00:40:27.700 align:middle line:90%
It was stopped.

00:40:27.700 --> 00:40:29.800 align:middle line:90%
It was over the stoop.

00:40:29.800 --> 00:40:31.410 align:middle line:90%
It was flashing.

00:40:31.410 --> 00:40:35.220 align:middle line:90%
So he had a lazy flashback.

00:40:35.220 --> 00:40:37.750 align:middle line:90%
So what is it they want?

00:40:37.750 --> 00:40:40.400 align:middle line:84%
I always ask, what
is that they want?

00:40:40.400 --> 00:40:45.680 align:middle line:84%
And Ricardo his whole life
is world peace situation.

00:40:45.680 --> 00:40:48.860 align:middle line:84%
He's got-- his symbol is the
flag, the Royce Nicholas Royce

00:40:48.860 --> 00:40:52.070 align:middle line:84%
flag, which was given to
the League of Nations.

00:40:52.070 --> 00:40:54.740 align:middle line:84%
Nicholas Royece was a
mistake from Russia,

00:40:54.740 --> 00:40:57.160 align:middle line:84%
who lived Lasa and
India, and could

00:40:57.160 --> 00:41:01.160 align:middle line:84%
see in the world as
a potential place.

00:41:01.160 --> 00:41:02.980 align:middle line:84%
What I learned from
Ricardo was that we

00:41:02.980 --> 00:41:06.690 align:middle line:84%
could be an example in the
universe of coming together.

00:41:06.690 --> 00:41:08.710 align:middle line:84%
I thought we was the
worse of the worst.

00:41:08.710 --> 00:41:13.400 align:middle line:84%
But he says, no,
we have a potential

00:41:13.400 --> 00:41:14.359 align:middle line:90%
of the habit making it.

00:41:14.359 --> 00:41:16.566 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So there are worst
behaved being out there.

00:41:16.566 --> 00:41:18.490 align:middle line:84%
>>HARRIS: Oh God,
on the planets,

00:41:18.490 --> 00:41:20.160 align:middle line:90%
they're worse behaved planets.

00:41:20.160 --> 00:41:22.620 align:middle line:84%
But we have a potential
that we can make it.

00:41:22.620 --> 00:41:23.680 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:41:23.680 --> 00:41:25.263 align:middle line:84%
>>HARRIS: But he
said, a lot of people

00:41:25.263 --> 00:41:28.690 align:middle line:90%
have to activate to do that.

00:41:28.690 --> 00:41:29.490 align:middle line:90%
And it's really.

00:41:29.490 --> 00:41:30.160 align:middle line:90%
Interesting

00:41:30.160 --> 00:41:32.350 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Well, and also,
one of the word you said

00:41:32.350 --> 00:41:34.230 align:middle line:90%
a moment ago really strikes.

00:41:34.230 --> 00:41:40.230 align:middle line:84%
At that is this notion of
the directive we must ask.

00:41:40.230 --> 00:41:41.950 align:middle line:84%
It's not up to
another civilization

00:41:41.950 --> 00:41:44.350 align:middle line:90%
to impose themselves upon us.

00:41:44.350 --> 00:41:48.260 align:middle line:84%
If we do not ask, and we
do not perform our thoughts

00:41:48.260 --> 00:41:50.560 align:middle line:84%
in alignment with what
they have to offer,

00:41:50.560 --> 00:41:52.810 align:middle line:90%
it's not going to happen.

00:41:52.810 --> 00:41:54.590 align:middle line:84%
>>HARRIS: Well, I know
where you're going,

00:41:54.590 --> 00:41:59.110 align:middle line:84%
you're going to go to
the invitation I got.

00:41:59.110 --> 00:42:01.400 align:middle line:84%
The imitation-- and
it's hard for me

00:42:01.400 --> 00:42:04.210 align:middle line:84%
speak about it, because I'm
a nuts and bolts journalist.

00:42:04.210 --> 00:42:06.500 align:middle line:84%
And this turned my
world upside down.

00:42:06.500 --> 00:42:09.000 align:middle line:84%
But, remember, I did
see close encounters.

00:42:09.000 --> 00:42:10.860 align:middle line:90%
Remember, they were invited.

00:42:10.860 --> 00:42:11.990 align:middle line:90%
They were invited.

00:42:11.990 --> 00:42:14.200 align:middle line:90%
So you were there.

00:42:14.200 --> 00:42:15.070 align:middle line:90%
You were open.

00:42:15.070 --> 00:42:18.450 align:middle line:84%
And you have been invited to
go to these large gatherings

00:42:18.450 --> 00:42:21.350 align:middle line:84%
of [INTERPOSING VOICES]
Shasta, and also you

00:42:21.350 --> 00:42:22.390 align:middle line:90%
went to South America?

00:42:22.390 --> 00:42:25.514 align:middle line:84%
>>HARRIS: I went to
Cordoba, Argentina, but--

00:42:25.514 --> 00:42:26.930 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So let's
talk about what

00:42:26.930 --> 00:42:29.370 align:middle line:84%
happened in Shasta,
because this really

00:42:29.370 --> 00:42:33.060 align:middle line:84%
was-- it was no longer
theoretical for you.

00:42:33.060 --> 00:42:35.579 align:middle line:90%


00:42:35.579 --> 00:42:36.620 align:middle line:90%
And there were witnesses.

00:42:36.620 --> 00:42:39.810 align:middle line:84%
So let's talk about
what happened.

00:42:39.810 --> 00:42:42.350 align:middle line:84%
>>HARRIS: Well, OK, I was
doing all these stories

00:42:42.350 --> 00:42:46.470 align:middle line:84%
on these Latin Americans
and [INAUDIBLE] in Russia,

00:42:46.470 --> 00:42:48.740 align:middle line:90%
researching the [INAUDIBLE].

00:42:48.740 --> 00:42:50.410 align:middle line:84%
And he sends me a
message, Anterel

00:42:50.410 --> 00:42:52.200 align:middle line:90%
wants you to come to Shasta.

00:42:52.200 --> 00:42:56.320 align:middle line:84%
And I thought, he just wants
me to come to Shasta, Ricardo,

00:42:56.320 --> 00:42:57.350 align:middle line:90%
so he's making this up.

00:42:57.350 --> 00:42:58.590 align:middle line:90%
You know, this is crazy.

00:42:58.590 --> 00:43:00.460 align:middle line:84%
And then I said,
no, I can't come.

00:43:00.460 --> 00:43:03.160 align:middle line:84%
I have a conference I'm
working on, and so forth.

00:43:03.160 --> 00:43:07.555 align:middle line:84%
Then he comes from Madrid,
and Ricardo calls me.

00:43:07.555 --> 00:43:09.180 align:middle line:90%
And he says.

00:43:09.180 --> 00:43:10.180 align:middle line:90%
I'm telling you again.

00:43:10.180 --> 00:43:11.800 align:middle line:90%
You have to be in Shasta.

00:43:11.800 --> 00:43:13.440 align:middle line:90%
So I agreed.

00:43:13.440 --> 00:43:15.270 align:middle line:90%
I slept in a one-man tent.

00:43:15.270 --> 00:43:16.620 align:middle line:90%
I didn't eat for three days.

00:43:16.620 --> 00:43:17.420 align:middle line:90%
It was freezing.

00:43:17.420 --> 00:43:18.770 align:middle line:90%
We all had to use porta potties.

00:43:18.770 --> 00:43:20.020 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: You're not a camper.

00:43:20.020 --> 00:43:21.600 align:middle line:90%
>>HARRIS: Not at all.

00:43:21.600 --> 00:43:24.290 align:middle line:84%
And the other thing that
people don't understand

00:43:24.290 --> 00:43:26.140 align:middle line:90%
is it was all in Spanish.

00:43:26.140 --> 00:43:28.590 align:middle line:84%
So I'm not understanding
a lot of what's happening.

00:43:28.590 --> 00:43:31.420 align:middle line:84%
I had an Italian
interpreter next to me

00:43:31.420 --> 00:43:34.830 align:middle line:84%
who had to translate every
word Ricardo was saying.

00:43:34.830 --> 00:43:36.890 align:middle line:84%
And it was a
spiritual preparation.

00:43:36.890 --> 00:43:40.050 align:middle line:84%
There was a lot of mantras, and
a lot of praying, and so forth,

00:43:40.050 --> 00:43:41.580 align:middle line:90%
for peace.

00:43:41.580 --> 00:43:44.122 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Now, did you actually
think there was a point to it

00:43:44.122 --> 00:43:45.663 align:middle line:84%
with you, that you
were going to have

00:43:45.663 --> 00:43:46.960 align:middle line:90%
an experience at this point?

00:43:46.960 --> 00:43:49.000 align:middle line:90%
>>HARRIS: No, no, oh no.

00:43:49.000 --> 00:43:50.780 align:middle line:90%
No, I couldn't wait to eat.

00:43:50.780 --> 00:43:53.065 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: You're
hungry and cold.

00:43:53.065 --> 00:43:54.940 align:middle line:84%
>>HARRIS: And they go,
they're making a soup.

00:43:54.940 --> 00:43:57.070 align:middle line:90%
You can have it at the last day.

00:43:57.070 --> 00:43:59.720 align:middle line:84%
And I was going, but this
is, like, so uncomfortable.

00:43:59.720 --> 00:44:02.390 align:middle line:84%
And so as we're doing
the final ceremony

00:44:02.390 --> 00:44:04.490 align:middle line:84%
it's going to
close Sunday night,

00:44:04.490 --> 00:44:07.510 align:middle line:84%
Ricardo walks up to me, be
kneels down in front of me.

00:44:07.510 --> 00:44:08.800 align:middle line:90%
And he said, Anterel is here.

00:44:08.800 --> 00:44:11.570 align:middle line:90%
Can you handle it?

00:44:11.570 --> 00:44:16.700 align:middle line:84%
That's where I wrote, you
say yes to everything.

00:44:16.700 --> 00:44:18.140 align:middle line:90%
I was terrorized.

00:44:18.140 --> 00:44:18.990 align:middle line:90%
I said, yes.

00:44:18.990 --> 00:44:20.640 align:middle line:84%
And he said, well,
I can't go, he said.

00:44:20.640 --> 00:44:22.680 align:middle line:90%
But he's chosen two other women.

00:44:22.680 --> 00:44:25.610 align:middle line:90%
And he's standing in the forest.

00:44:25.610 --> 00:44:26.770 align:middle line:90%
And you hold their hands.

00:44:26.770 --> 00:44:31.100 align:middle line:84%
And he says, you wait until--
and if you study my interviews,

00:44:31.100 --> 00:44:34.100 align:middle line:84%
and I hope people go
on my website-- what

00:44:34.100 --> 00:44:39.330 align:middle line:84%
happens with these encounters is
a mist comes out of the ground,

00:44:39.330 --> 00:44:42.880 align:middle line:84%
like a portal, a white
minister called a zendra.

00:44:42.880 --> 00:44:45.500 align:middle line:84%
And so Ricardo said, wait
until the zendra comes up

00:44:45.500 --> 00:44:47.610 align:middle line:84%
out of the ground so
you're in this atmosphere,

00:44:47.610 --> 00:44:50.190 align:middle line:84%
because it's common atmosphere
between you and the being.

00:44:50.190 --> 00:44:53.210 align:middle line:84%
And then when that happens,
you go and stand in these,

00:44:53.210 --> 00:44:55.620 align:middle line:84%
let go of the hands of
the other two women.

00:44:55.620 --> 00:44:58.230 align:middle line:84%
The most terrifying moment was
to let go of anybody's hand.

00:44:58.230 --> 00:45:01.900 align:middle line:84%
As long as I was grabbing
their hands, there was no moon.

00:45:01.900 --> 00:45:03.350 align:middle line:90%
There was no light we could use.

00:45:03.350 --> 00:45:05.150 align:middle line:84%
I was tripping all
over the place.

00:45:05.150 --> 00:45:07.460 align:middle line:90%
I knew was going into a forest.

00:45:07.460 --> 00:45:09.600 align:middle line:84%
This is in Shasta
near the sand flats.

00:45:09.600 --> 00:45:11.520 align:middle line:90%
And it was terror.

00:45:11.520 --> 00:45:13.930 align:middle line:84%
My heart was coming
out of my body.

00:45:13.930 --> 00:45:16.402 align:middle line:84%
I mean, it was like
I was thinking,

00:45:16.402 --> 00:45:17.360 align:middle line:90%
what's going to happen?

00:45:17.360 --> 00:45:18.780 align:middle line:90%
And Ricardo wasn't with us.

00:45:18.780 --> 00:45:21.300 align:middle line:84%
So I could hear
him saying mantras

00:45:21.300 --> 00:45:22.740 align:middle line:90%
in the back with everybody else.

00:45:22.740 --> 00:45:26.470 align:middle line:84%
And they were doing
the [INAUDIBLE] mantra.

00:45:26.470 --> 00:45:29.680 align:middle line:84%
They were doing the
cultural preparations.

00:45:29.680 --> 00:45:32.860 align:middle line:90%
And I saw that mist.

00:45:32.860 --> 00:45:34.870 align:middle line:84%
I walked with the
other two women.

00:45:34.870 --> 00:45:36.132 align:middle line:90%
I let go of the hand.

00:45:36.132 --> 00:45:40.210 align:middle line:84%
And in front of me is
standing a 10 foot tall guy

00:45:40.210 --> 00:45:42.470 align:middle line:90%
with a hoodie an.

00:45:42.470 --> 00:45:43.940 align:middle line:90%
He had a hoodie on.

00:45:43.940 --> 00:45:46.110 align:middle line:84%
And he had, like,
a gym outfit on.

00:45:46.110 --> 00:45:49.720 align:middle line:84%
And he was standing very
still against a tree.

00:45:49.720 --> 00:45:52.990 align:middle line:84%
And I heard him speak constantly
in a language I could not

00:45:52.990 --> 00:45:53.790 align:middle line:90%
understand.

00:45:53.790 --> 00:45:57.310 align:middle line:84%
And it sounded like it
was a bull horn, a radio

00:45:57.310 --> 00:45:58.600 align:middle line:90%
transmission.

00:45:58.600 --> 00:45:59.997 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Could
you see his face?

00:45:59.997 --> 00:46:01.330 align:middle line:90%
>>HARRIS: I didn't see his face.

00:46:01.330 --> 00:46:04.210 align:middle line:84%
I saw his entire form,
his entire shadow.

00:46:04.210 --> 00:46:07.247 align:middle line:84%
And I knew his arms were
out. he had his arms out.

00:46:07.247 --> 00:46:09.580 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So you hear this
voice that seems to be coming

00:46:09.580 --> 00:46:09.840 align:middle line:90%
at you--

00:46:09.840 --> 00:46:10.610 align:middle line:90%
>>HARRIS: Constantly.

00:46:10.610 --> 00:46:12.026 align:middle line:84%
And I'm going,
that's not Spanish.

00:46:12.026 --> 00:46:14.290 align:middle line:90%
What in the World is that?

00:46:14.290 --> 00:46:19.990 align:middle line:84%
And at the very end of about
six minutes of constant talking

00:46:19.990 --> 00:46:23.450 align:middle line:84%
in a language that I found out
was [INAUDIBLE], which Ricardo

00:46:23.450 --> 00:46:26.790 align:middle line:84%
explained to me is a language
that the [INAUDIBLE] speak,

00:46:26.790 --> 00:46:29.780 align:middle line:84%
and also very well
known in South America,

00:46:29.780 --> 00:46:34.300 align:middle line:84%
at the very end in English,
he said, thank you.

00:46:34.300 --> 00:46:37.060 align:middle line:90%


00:46:37.060 --> 00:46:38.650 align:middle line:84%
And I said, did
I hear thank you?

00:46:38.650 --> 00:46:40.070 align:middle line:90%
No, no, I'm crazy.

00:46:40.070 --> 00:46:40.870 align:middle line:90%
That can't be.

00:46:40.870 --> 00:46:41.480 align:middle line:90%
That can't be.

00:46:41.480 --> 00:46:42.400 align:middle line:90%
That can't be thank you.

00:46:42.400 --> 00:46:43.510 align:middle line:90%
But then I couldn't make it up.

00:46:43.510 --> 00:46:45.093 align:middle line:84%
So I thought, you
didn't make that up.

00:46:45.093 --> 00:46:46.210 align:middle line:90%
So you heard it.

00:46:46.210 --> 00:46:49.730 align:middle line:84%
And when he turned around,
almost like a robot,

00:46:49.730 --> 00:46:51.430 align:middle line:84%
he turned himself
around and started

00:46:51.430 --> 00:46:56.310 align:middle line:84%
walking back into the
forest, I just stood there.

00:46:56.310 --> 00:46:58.060 align:middle line:90%
By the way, what was I thinking?

00:46:58.060 --> 00:46:59.300 align:middle line:90%
I didn't know what to say.

00:46:59.300 --> 00:47:02.000 align:middle line:84%
So, mentally, I was going,
I respect you, [INAUDIBLE].

00:47:02.000 --> 00:47:03.320 align:middle line:90%
I respect you.

00:47:03.320 --> 00:47:04.140 align:middle line:90%
It was mentally.

00:47:04.140 --> 00:47:06.510 align:middle line:84%
I couldn't say, I
love you, because he

00:47:06.510 --> 00:47:08.580 align:middle line:90%
looked like nothing I ever saw.

00:47:08.580 --> 00:47:13.250 align:middle line:84%
And I didn't-- it was so
foreign to my-- so I just said,

00:47:13.250 --> 00:47:14.360 align:middle line:90%
I respect you.

00:47:14.360 --> 00:47:16.880 align:middle line:84%
I realized when I was doing
that, it was protocols.

00:47:16.880 --> 00:47:19.730 align:middle line:84%
It was everything I wanted
to know about exopolitics.

00:47:19.730 --> 00:47:21.060 align:middle line:90%
What is the protocol?

00:47:21.060 --> 00:47:23.102 align:middle line:84%
Just like [INAUDIBLE] when
you meet these people.

00:47:23.102 --> 00:47:24.268 align:middle line:90%
What are you supposed to do?

00:47:24.268 --> 00:47:26.730 align:middle line:84%
I certainly wasn't going to
run up to him and shake hands.

00:47:26.730 --> 00:47:29.192 align:middle line:90%
He's too tall.

00:47:29.192 --> 00:47:30.954 align:middle line:84%
But also, I didn't
know if you could

00:47:30.954 --> 00:47:33.370 align:middle line:84%
do any of that-- I didn't know
what you're supposed to do.

00:47:33.370 --> 00:47:34.830 align:middle line:90%
I didn't know.

00:47:34.830 --> 00:47:36.950 align:middle line:84%
And then when I go
to Ricardo, I said,

00:47:36.950 --> 00:47:38.630 align:middle line:90%
what was I supposed to do?

00:47:38.630 --> 00:47:40.436 align:middle line:84%
I don't know what
I'm supposed to do.

00:47:40.436 --> 00:47:41.560 align:middle line:90%
And he said, what happened?

00:47:41.560 --> 00:47:43.370 align:middle line:84%
I said, I think he
said, thank you.

00:47:43.370 --> 00:47:46.830 align:middle line:84%
And he said, well, you're
going to have to write about.

00:47:46.830 --> 00:47:49.860 align:middle line:84%
And I said, is that
why he chose me,

00:47:49.860 --> 00:47:53.490 align:middle line:84%
because I write in four
different languages,

00:47:53.490 --> 00:47:56.569 align:middle line:84%
and he invited me here so
that I would tell the world?

00:47:56.569 --> 00:47:58.860 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And because you're
serious about what you do.

00:47:58.860 --> 00:48:01.397 align:middle line:84%
You do it authentically,
and from the heart.

00:48:01.397 --> 00:48:02.855 align:middle line:84%
>>HARRIS: Well, it
really happened.

00:48:02.855 --> 00:48:04.230 align:middle line:84%
I don't know what
to tell people.

00:48:04.230 --> 00:48:05.480 align:middle line:90%
It really happened.

00:48:05.480 --> 00:48:07.580 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So did
you feel that he

00:48:07.580 --> 00:48:10.340 align:middle line:84%
was thanking you for,
basically, a lifetime of pouring

00:48:10.340 --> 00:48:14.140 align:middle line:84%
your heart into this, and
making these things known?

00:48:14.140 --> 00:48:15.760 align:middle line:84%
>>HARRIS: Yeah,
it could be that.

00:48:15.760 --> 00:48:21.300 align:middle line:84%
And it could be a resolution
of close encounters.

00:48:21.300 --> 00:48:24.550 align:middle line:84%
See, that's what woke me
up, because I was a teacher.

00:48:24.550 --> 00:48:26.570 align:middle line:90%
I wasn't into UFOs .

00:48:26.570 --> 00:48:29.120 align:middle line:90%
So it can full circle.

00:48:29.120 --> 00:48:33.080 align:middle line:84%
I was invited to do this
because I want the world to know

00:48:33.080 --> 00:48:35.210 align:middle line:90%
that they are people.

00:48:35.210 --> 00:48:37.390 align:middle line:84%
They are not little
creatures running around.

00:48:37.390 --> 00:48:42.290 align:middle line:84%
And they are trying
to help us grow up,

00:48:42.290 --> 00:48:43.790 align:middle line:90%
the consciousness aspect.

00:48:43.790 --> 00:48:46.170 align:middle line:84%
And you and I have talked
about consciousness.

00:48:46.170 --> 00:48:48.357 align:middle line:84%
Unless a human
grows in evolution

00:48:48.357 --> 00:48:49.940 align:middle line:84%
of human consciousness,
you can't have

00:48:49.940 --> 00:48:51.720 align:middle line:90%
a dialogue with these people.

00:48:51.720 --> 00:48:55.190 align:middle line:84%
What are you going
to say to them?

00:48:55.190 --> 00:48:59.180 align:middle line:84%
And by the way, just
recently I got the message,

00:48:59.180 --> 00:49:02.990 align:middle line:84%
if you will lead, we will
maximize your efforts.

00:49:02.990 --> 00:49:04.700 align:middle line:90%
We will match your efforts.

00:49:04.700 --> 00:49:08.295 align:middle line:84%
In other word,s you
got to go ahead and--

00:49:08.295 --> 00:49:10.670 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: You've got to do
the boots on the ground stuff.

00:49:10.670 --> 00:49:12.225 align:middle line:90%
And I'll give you a boost.

00:49:12.225 --> 00:49:14.100 align:middle line:84%
>>HARRIS: But they'll
give the world a boost.

00:49:14.100 --> 00:49:16.340 align:middle line:84%
I think that is
the universal you.

00:49:16.340 --> 00:49:18.290 align:middle line:90%
It isn't Paola you.

00:49:18.290 --> 00:49:23.240 align:middle line:84%
It's if you people,
you humanity will lead,

00:49:23.240 --> 00:49:24.890 align:middle line:90%
we will give you a hand.

00:49:24.890 --> 00:49:27.010 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: I think there's
so much help that's

00:49:27.010 --> 00:49:30.350 align:middle line:84%
standing by waiting for us,
to recognize that it's there,

00:49:30.350 --> 00:49:33.640 align:middle line:84%
and to ask for it
in the right way.

00:49:33.640 --> 00:49:34.720 align:middle line:90%
>>HARRIS: I believe that.

00:49:34.720 --> 00:49:38.190 align:middle line:84%
And I think thank you
for addressing this,

00:49:38.190 --> 00:49:41.210 align:middle line:84%
because it's darn
serious right now

00:49:41.210 --> 00:49:44.080 align:middle line:84%
on this planet with the
choices we have to make.

And we do have friends
in high places.

00:49:46.950 --> 00:49:50.040 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Just as-- and I think
it's only fair and balanced

00:49:50.040 --> 00:49:52.860 align:middle line:84%
reporting to mention
that we also have friends

00:49:52.860 --> 00:49:55.000 align:middle line:90%
in kind of scary places.

00:49:55.000 --> 00:49:57.810 align:middle line:84%
There are beings and
others who interfere,

00:49:57.810 --> 00:50:01.060 align:middle line:84%
and who work and collaborate
at levels that we probably

00:50:01.060 --> 00:50:02.960 align:middle line:84%
would prefer not
to even know about,

00:50:02.960 --> 00:50:05.700 align:middle line:84%
that create chaos, and
create the situation we have.

00:50:05.700 --> 00:50:08.910 align:middle line:84%
It's just maybe working
with our own innate

00:50:08.910 --> 00:50:14.770 align:middle line:84%
dispositions, and vulnerability,
gullibility, and all that.

00:50:14.770 --> 00:50:17.680 align:middle line:84%
But we've been lead down
some pretty dark paths

00:50:17.680 --> 00:50:19.570 align:middle line:90%
as a civilization.

00:50:19.570 --> 00:50:22.360 align:middle line:84%
And as more and
more people begin

00:50:22.360 --> 00:50:24.400 align:middle line:84%
waking up-- not
necessarily having

00:50:24.400 --> 00:50:26.280 align:middle line:84%
these extraordinary
experiences even,

00:50:26.280 --> 00:50:28.560 align:middle line:84%
but just waking up
and knowing there's

00:50:28.560 --> 00:50:31.710 align:middle line:84%
so much more to the human
story and potential--

00:50:31.710 --> 00:50:35.170 align:middle line:84%
it's really beautiful
to know that we

00:50:35.170 --> 00:50:36.900 align:middle line:90%

>>HARRIS: Yeah, and I
think the law of attraction

00:50:38.960 --> 00:50:40.190 align:middle line:90%
I know you believe in.

00:50:40.190 --> 00:50:41.810 align:middle line:84%
And let's attract
the good stuff.

00:50:41.810 --> 00:50:42.810 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah, exactly.

00:50:42.810 --> 00:50:45.330 align:middle line:84%
>>HARRIS: And I think the
bad stuff comes from fear.

00:50:45.330 --> 00:50:47.800 align:middle line:84%
And I gotta honestly tell
you, I was terrorized.

00:50:47.800 --> 00:50:49.970 align:middle line:84%
So it's, like, I know
what fear is like.

[INTERPOSING VOICES]

00:50:51.624 --> 00:50:53.790 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: You hadn't
experienced anything like that.

00:50:53.790 --> 00:50:54.770 align:middle line:90%
>>HARRIS: And it's scary.

00:50:54.770 --> 00:50:55.770 align:middle line:90%
And everything is scary.

00:50:55.770 --> 00:50:59.050 align:middle line:84%
But, you know, I think fear
is not a vibration which

00:50:59.050 --> 00:51:00.410 align:middle line:90%
attracts the other side.

00:51:00.410 --> 00:51:01.360 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:51:01.360 --> 00:51:04.750 align:middle line:84%
>>HARRIS: So in the end,
they all said, Paola,

00:51:04.750 --> 00:51:06.420 align:middle line:90%
you got to start meditating.

00:51:06.420 --> 00:51:07.790 align:middle line:90%
And I said, when do I have time?

00:51:07.790 --> 00:51:10.694 align:middle line:84%
In between what do
I start meditating?

00:51:10.694 --> 00:51:11.610 align:middle line:90%
I don't have any time.

00:51:11.610 --> 00:51:15.780 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: No excuses,
even if it's five minutes.

00:51:15.780 --> 00:51:18.860 align:middle line:84%
I have just one more
quick question to ask you.

00:51:18.860 --> 00:51:21.870 align:middle line:84%
The thing is, this field, I've
been following it probably

00:51:21.870 --> 00:51:24.670 align:middle line:84%
since the late '90s now, I
suppose, interested in it,

00:51:24.670 --> 00:51:27.920 align:middle line:84%
before following it for
the last 17, 18 years.

00:51:27.920 --> 00:51:30.330 align:middle line:84%
And you've been in it
for 35 years, twice that.

00:51:30.330 --> 00:51:35.940 align:middle line:84%
And I see that it's a really
kind of fractured community.

00:51:35.940 --> 00:51:38.810 align:middle line:84%
You have people who don't
want the story to change.

00:51:38.810 --> 00:51:40.950 align:middle line:84%
They don't want it
to progress, who

00:51:40.950 --> 00:51:43.950 align:middle line:84%
really want to stick with just
certain artifacts and stories,

00:51:43.950 --> 00:51:45.020 align:middle line:90%
and that's it.

00:51:45.020 --> 00:51:47.154 align:middle line:84%
And that's the bulk
of the conferences.

00:51:47.154 --> 00:51:48.570 align:middle line:84%
And then you have
other people who

00:51:48.570 --> 00:51:50.090 align:middle line:84%
are beginning to
say, no, we need

00:51:50.090 --> 00:51:52.580 align:middle line:84%
to look at this on a
level of consciousness,

00:51:52.580 --> 00:51:55.880 align:middle line:90%
not just material evidence.

00:51:55.880 --> 00:51:58.730 align:middle line:84%
And you're bridging both
those worlds right now,

00:51:58.730 --> 00:51:59.990 align:middle line:90%
from what I can see.

00:51:59.990 --> 00:52:02.145 align:middle line:84%
You just had a conference,
a Star Works conference.

00:52:02.145 --> 00:52:03.691 align:middle line:90%
It was the second one or third?

00:52:03.691 --> 00:52:04.940 align:middle line:90%
>>HARRIS: It's the second one.

00:52:04.940 --> 00:52:09.020 align:middle line:84%
It was in Nevada in November
13, 14, and 15, yes.

00:52:09.020 --> 00:52:09.820 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: 2015.

00:52:09.820 --> 00:52:14.410 align:middle line:84%
So now, from what you're
seeing having such a history

00:52:14.410 --> 00:52:18.290 align:middle line:84%
with all of this, where does
the shift need to happen?

00:52:18.290 --> 00:52:19.220 align:middle line:90%
What is stuck?

00:52:19.220 --> 00:52:21.120 align:middle line:90%
And what is helpful?

00:52:21.120 --> 00:52:23.400 align:middle line:84%
>>HARRIS: Let's go
back to John Mac.

00:52:23.400 --> 00:52:24.525 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: We love John Mac.

00:52:24.525 --> 00:52:25.830 align:middle line:90%
>>HARRIS: I love John.

00:52:25.830 --> 00:52:27.770 align:middle line:90%
God bless him, I love him.

00:52:27.770 --> 00:52:31.670 align:middle line:84%
He said, unless we change our
worldview to accommodate this,

00:52:31.670 --> 00:52:33.950 align:middle line:84%
that we will be stuck in
the same old rut doing

00:52:33.950 --> 00:52:35.580 align:middle line:90%
the same old things.

00:52:35.580 --> 00:52:40.120 align:middle line:10%
And the inspiration I
had for this conference

00:52:40.120 --> 00:52:43.270 align:middle line:10%
was a young man called
[INAUDIBLE] Martinez,

00:52:43.270 --> 00:52:47.250 align:middle line:10%
who is a Native American who
is fighting for climate change.

00:52:47.250 --> 00:52:50.480 align:middle line:10%
He just basically spoke
to the United Nations

00:52:50.480 --> 00:52:52.100 align:middle line:10%
on climate change
with Robert Redford.

00:52:52.100 --> 00:52:54.960 align:middle line:84%
And what he said
was very profound.

00:52:54.960 --> 00:52:58.150 align:middle line:84%
He said, the greatest
challenge for humanity

00:52:58.150 --> 00:52:59.880 align:middle line:84%
is the evolution of
human consciousness.

00:52:59.880 --> 00:53:01.960 align:middle line:90%
The planet doesn't need saving.

00:53:01.960 --> 00:53:03.340 align:middle line:90%
We do.

00:53:03.340 --> 00:53:05.176 align:middle line:90%
This is a 15-year-old kid.

00:53:05.176 --> 00:53:06.550 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Yes, we
need to evolve,

00:53:06.550 --> 00:53:09.562 align:middle line:84%
just wake up to what we
actually are, absolutely.

00:53:09.562 --> 00:53:10.520 align:middle line:90%
Yeah, that's beautiful.

00:53:10.520 --> 00:53:11.700 align:middle line:90%
He's a beautiful young man.

00:53:11.700 --> 00:53:16.100 align:middle line:84%
>>HARRIS: He's a beautiful-- and
he actually welcomed everybody.

00:53:16.100 --> 00:53:18.680 align:middle line:84%
And he is the example
of the future.

00:53:18.680 --> 00:53:20.562 align:middle line:90%
And I want support him 100%.

00:53:20.562 --> 00:53:21.520 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: There you go.

00:53:21.520 --> 00:53:25.140 align:middle line:84%
So it's for the next
generations of us.

00:53:25.140 --> 00:53:26.370 align:middle line:90%
Paola, thank you so much.

00:53:26.370 --> 00:53:28.110 align:middle line:84%
It's a couple hours
that just zipped by.

00:53:28.110 --> 00:53:30.970 align:middle line:84%
And I so respect your
diligence over the years

00:53:30.970 --> 00:53:32.170 align:middle line:90%

00:53:32.170 --> 00:53:33.857 align:middle line:90%
Hats off to you.
