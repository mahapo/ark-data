00:00:18.227 --> 00:00:20.060 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA MEREDITH: One
of my favorite topics

00:00:20.060 --> 00:00:22.220 align:middle line:84%
is the nature of the
origin of our cosmos

00:00:22.220 --> 00:00:23.780 align:middle line:90%
and the human species.

00:00:23.780 --> 00:00:26.110 align:middle line:84%
Toward that end, I've brought
Michael Cremo here today

00:00:26.110 --> 00:00:28.140 align:middle line:84%
to give us an entirely
different glimpse

00:00:28.140 --> 00:00:31.480 align:middle line:84%
into our extreme
antiquity as a species.

00:00:31.480 --> 00:00:33.710 align:middle line:84%
He uses a combination
of conservative,

00:00:33.710 --> 00:00:36.700 align:middle line:84%
yet shocking to many,
archaeological research

00:00:36.700 --> 00:00:39.270 align:middle line:84%
discoveries, along with
the allegorical history

00:00:39.270 --> 00:00:41.910 align:middle line:84%
of the Hindu faith, which
contains some of the most

00:00:41.910 --> 00:00:43.890 align:middle line:84%
ancient descriptions
of our origins

00:00:43.890 --> 00:00:45.630 align:middle line:90%
of any doctrines in existence.

00:00:45.630 --> 00:00:47.900 align:middle line:84%
And it's so good to
see you again, Michael.

00:00:47.900 --> 00:00:50.030 align:middle line:84%
And, I mean, "My
Science, My Religion."

00:00:50.030 --> 00:00:52.510 align:middle line:84%
This is the stuff
of great debates,

00:00:52.510 --> 00:00:54.300 align:middle line:90%
and has been for how long?

00:00:54.300 --> 00:00:57.480 align:middle line:84%
I mean, how long have people
have been debating science

00:00:57.480 --> 00:00:59.420 align:middle line:84%
versus religion when
it comes to putting

00:00:59.420 --> 00:01:01.389 align:middle line:84%
our historical
roots together now?

00:01:01.389 --> 00:01:03.680 align:middle line:84%
>>MICHAEL CREMO: For hundreds
of years, even thousands.

00:01:03.680 --> 00:01:06.450 align:middle line:84%
As long as you've had the two
things, science and religion,

00:01:06.450 --> 00:01:09.760 align:middle line:84%
there's always been debates
about what their relationship

00:01:09.760 --> 00:01:13.680 align:middle line:84%
is and how they
overlap or don't.

00:01:13.680 --> 00:01:14.370 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:01:14.370 --> 00:01:17.470 align:middle line:84%
Well that's a very gutsy title
because it just kind of lays it

00:01:17.470 --> 00:01:19.330 align:middle line:90%
out right there for everyone.

00:01:19.330 --> 00:01:23.600 align:middle line:84%
It's not nuanced, it's in
our faces and it should be.

00:01:23.600 --> 00:01:26.090 align:middle line:84%
It seems to me, we've come
to a point where there's

00:01:26.090 --> 00:01:29.970 align:middle line:84%
nothing but dead ends and
kind of misinformation

00:01:29.970 --> 00:01:31.560 align:middle line:84%
anymore, if we're
sticking totally

00:01:31.560 --> 00:01:34.270 align:middle line:84%
with the empirical
scientific process

00:01:34.270 --> 00:01:37.720 align:middle line:84%
and trying to discover what
this magnificent species is all

00:01:37.720 --> 00:01:38.630 align:middle line:90%
about.

00:01:38.630 --> 00:01:42.130 align:middle line:84%
And I don't think anyone's
done more interesting

00:01:42.130 --> 00:01:44.619 align:middle line:84%
and work in more
depth than you when

00:01:44.619 --> 00:01:46.160 align:middle line:84%
it comes to trying
to reconcile this.

00:01:46.160 --> 00:01:49.930 align:middle line:84%
So what I want to
ask you first off is

00:01:49.930 --> 00:01:54.130 align:middle line:84%
what was your original kind
of intellectual origins

00:01:54.130 --> 00:01:57.440 align:middle line:84%
of your own that even
took you down this road?

00:01:57.440 --> 00:02:00.320 align:middle line:84%
>>CREMO: I think it has a lot
to do with how I was raised.

00:02:00.320 --> 00:02:06.950 align:middle line:84%
My father was a US Air
Force Intelligence officer,

00:02:06.950 --> 00:02:10.000 align:middle line:84%
so that meant a couple of things
for me as I was growing up.

00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:12.890 align:middle line:84%
First of all, it
meant I was living

00:02:12.890 --> 00:02:17.030 align:middle line:84%
in lots of different places,
and that was important for me.

00:02:17.030 --> 00:02:21.500 align:middle line:84%
For example, when I was a little
kid I was living in Hawaii

00:02:21.500 --> 00:02:24.600 align:middle line:84%
and I was exposed to
Chinese-Americans,

00:02:24.600 --> 00:02:28.970 align:middle line:84%
Japanese-Americans,
Filipino-Americans,

00:02:28.970 --> 00:02:30.750 align:middle line:90%
all types of Americans.

00:02:30.750 --> 00:02:34.440 align:middle line:84%
Then after that, I
was living in Europe

00:02:34.440 --> 00:02:40.280 align:middle line:84%
and one thing this
experience did for me was it

00:02:40.280 --> 00:02:42.440 align:middle line:84%
opened my eyes to
the fact there's

00:02:42.440 --> 00:02:47.280 align:middle line:84%
more than one way to
look at this world.

00:02:47.280 --> 00:02:50.140 align:middle line:84%
I may have a certain way
of looking at the world,

00:02:50.140 --> 00:02:55.750 align:middle line:84%
but other people have different
ways of looking at the world.

00:02:55.750 --> 00:03:02.170 align:middle line:84%
So when I was living in
Europe when I was a teenager,

00:03:02.170 --> 00:03:05.980 align:middle line:84%
I would go on my
school vacations

00:03:05.980 --> 00:03:08.130 align:middle line:90%
to different countries.

00:03:08.130 --> 00:03:12.140 align:middle line:84%
One place I went was
Stockholm, Sweden,

00:03:12.140 --> 00:03:14.730 align:middle line:84%
and I was staying in
a youth hostel there.

00:03:14.730 --> 00:03:21.060 align:middle line:84%
And I met some kids who had
traveled overland to India

00:03:21.060 --> 00:03:22.030 align:middle line:90%
and back.

00:03:22.030 --> 00:03:24.560 align:middle line:84%
Now, these days, it's
very difficult to do that.

00:03:24.560 --> 00:03:28.200 align:middle line:84%
In those days, in
the 1960s, you could.

00:03:28.200 --> 00:03:31.490 align:middle line:84%
And they told me about
their experiences

00:03:31.490 --> 00:03:36.420 align:middle line:84%
in India, seeing the Ganges
River, the Himalayan Mountains,

00:03:36.420 --> 00:03:39.540 align:middle line:84%
meeting different kinds
of yogis and mystics

00:03:39.540 --> 00:03:40.560 align:middle line:90%
and things like that.

00:03:40.560 --> 00:03:44.110 align:middle line:84%
So I became
fascinated with India

00:03:44.110 --> 00:03:46.500 align:middle line:84%
and I decided I would
like to go there.

00:03:46.500 --> 00:03:48.990 align:middle line:84%
And after that, whenever
I would encounter

00:03:48.990 --> 00:03:55.050 align:middle line:84%
some book of Indian
philosophy, I would look at it.

00:03:55.050 --> 00:03:59.170 align:middle line:84%
Now I'm not claiming that the
spiritual philosophy of India

00:03:59.170 --> 00:04:03.390 align:middle line:84%
is the only one
that has any truth

00:04:03.390 --> 00:04:07.150 align:middle line:84%
about these big
cosmological questions.

00:04:07.150 --> 00:04:09.930 align:middle line:84%
I think you can find truth
in lots of different places.

00:04:09.930 --> 00:04:17.740 align:middle line:84%
But this particular worldview
made a lot of sense to me.

00:04:17.740 --> 00:04:20.990 align:middle line:84%
And as you grow
older, you kind of

00:04:20.990 --> 00:04:22.980 align:middle line:84%
have to construct
your own worldview,

00:04:22.980 --> 00:04:29.050 align:middle line:84%
so I made use of the
worldview of ancient India

00:04:29.050 --> 00:04:33.310 align:middle line:90%
to inform my own worldview.

00:04:33.310 --> 00:04:39.890 align:middle line:84%
And eventually, I became
a disciple of a guru

00:04:39.890 --> 00:04:44.600 align:middle line:84%
from India, Bkaktivedanta
Swami Prabhupada.

00:04:44.600 --> 00:04:50.300 align:middle line:84%
And under his guidance,
I began an in-depth study

00:04:50.300 --> 00:04:54.420 align:middle line:84%
of the ancient Sanskrit
writings of India.

00:04:54.420 --> 00:05:02.160 align:middle line:84%
And I noticed there were a lot
of things in those writings

00:05:02.160 --> 00:05:04.150 align:middle line:84%
that were quite
different from anything

00:05:04.150 --> 00:05:08.080 align:middle line:84%
I had learned in school
from my teachers,

00:05:08.080 --> 00:05:10.400 align:middle line:90%
in high school or university.

00:05:10.400 --> 00:05:15.340 align:middle line:84%
For example, the historical
writings of ancient India,

00:05:15.340 --> 00:05:20.330 align:middle line:84%
the Puranas, describe
human populations

00:05:20.330 --> 00:05:27.200 align:middle line:84%
that have existed for
millions of years on Earth

00:05:27.200 --> 00:05:29.830 align:middle line:84%
going all the way back
to the very beginnings

00:05:29.830 --> 00:05:31.720 align:middle line:90%
of the history of life.

00:05:31.720 --> 00:05:36.240 align:middle line:84%
Now in school I'd always learned
that humans appeared fairly

00:05:36.240 --> 00:05:41.700 align:middle line:84%
late in the history of life on
Earth, less than 200,000 years

00:05:41.700 --> 00:05:45.060 align:middle line:84%
ago, having evolved
from more primitive

00:05:45.060 --> 00:05:47.300 align:middle line:90%
ape-like human ancestors.

00:05:47.300 --> 00:05:49.900 align:middle line:84%
So there was a big
contradiction there

00:05:49.900 --> 00:05:54.470 align:middle line:84%
and I had to decide how I
was going to deal with it.

00:05:54.470 --> 00:06:00.460 align:middle line:84%
Now, one thing I could
have done was just

00:06:00.460 --> 00:06:06.210 align:middle line:84%
dismissed what I was reading
in the Puranas as mythology

00:06:06.210 --> 00:06:10.900 align:middle line:84%
and stick with the
modern scientific account

00:06:10.900 --> 00:06:13.394 align:middle line:90%
of human origins and antiquity.

00:06:13.394 --> 00:06:15.060 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: I was going
to say, isn't that

00:06:15.060 --> 00:06:18.590 align:middle line:84%
a common problem, though,
with Western humans?

00:06:18.590 --> 00:06:22.410 align:middle line:84%
You go to your church
or synagogue, temple,

00:06:22.410 --> 00:06:25.650 align:middle line:84%
and you're given these
allegorical stories.

00:06:25.650 --> 00:06:27.850 align:middle line:84%
And the only way you
can contend with it

00:06:27.850 --> 00:06:30.220 align:middle line:84%
alongside your
Western education is

00:06:30.220 --> 00:06:32.380 align:middle line:84%
you have to dismiss
one or the other.

00:06:32.380 --> 00:06:34.490 align:middle line:84%
>>CREMO: Yeah, you're
confronted with a dilemma.

00:06:34.490 --> 00:06:35.115 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:06:35.115 --> 00:06:39.730 align:middle line:84%
>>CREMO: So I could have
dismissed the accounts

00:06:39.730 --> 00:06:44.610 align:middle line:84%
in the Puranas as mythological,
as not really true,

00:06:44.610 --> 00:06:47.750 align:middle line:84%
and just accepted the
scientific evidence

00:06:47.750 --> 00:06:51.370 align:middle line:84%
I read about in my
textbooks as true.

00:06:51.370 --> 00:06:55.870 align:middle line:84%
Or I could've just
decided, well, I'm

00:06:55.870 --> 00:06:59.150 align:middle line:84%
going to have faith in
what the Puranas say

00:06:59.150 --> 00:07:05.010 align:middle line:84%
and I don't care what the
scientific evidence says.

00:07:05.010 --> 00:07:09.100 align:middle line:84%
But I decided to take
another approach,

00:07:09.100 --> 00:07:12.700 align:middle line:84%
and that was to
really look carefully

00:07:12.700 --> 00:07:18.440 align:middle line:84%
at the scientific evidence
and, at the same time,

00:07:18.440 --> 00:07:23.640 align:middle line:84%
accept what the Puranas were
saying as possibly true.

00:07:23.640 --> 00:07:28.990 align:middle line:84%
And that led me into
eight years of research

00:07:28.990 --> 00:07:31.010 align:middle line:84%
into the whole
history of archaeology

00:07:31.010 --> 00:07:35.340 align:middle line:84%
because I want to
see are there perhaps

00:07:35.340 --> 00:07:40.820 align:middle line:84%
any archaeological
discoveries that

00:07:40.820 --> 00:07:46.080 align:middle line:84%
are consistent with the accounts
of extreme human antiquity

00:07:46.080 --> 00:07:50.120 align:middle line:90%
that I found in the Puranas.

00:07:50.120 --> 00:07:55.280 align:middle line:84%
Now, the first place I looked
was in the current textbooks.

00:07:55.280 --> 00:08:01.980 align:middle line:84%
And in the textbooks, I
didn't see any such evidence.

00:08:01.980 --> 00:08:08.120 align:middle line:84%
But I thought, let me
look beyond the textbooks,

00:08:08.120 --> 00:08:15.370 align:middle line:84%
let me look into the original
scientific reports published--

00:08:15.370 --> 00:08:19.170 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: How did you
decide to do that?

00:08:19.170 --> 00:08:22.560 align:middle line:84%
I mean, you had to go to some
rather obscure documents.

00:08:22.560 --> 00:08:27.320 align:middle line:84%
At least documents that have
been obscured historically.

00:08:27.320 --> 00:08:29.790 align:middle line:84%
>>CREMO: Well, I
think, again, this

00:08:29.790 --> 00:08:32.299 align:middle line:84%
has something to do
with how I was raised.

00:08:32.299 --> 00:08:35.159 align:middle line:84%
As I was explaining
earlier, my father

00:08:35.159 --> 00:08:38.809 align:middle line:84%
was an intelligence officer in
the United States Air Force.

00:08:38.809 --> 00:08:42.240 align:middle line:84%
I grew up among people in
the intelligence service,

00:08:42.240 --> 00:08:46.050 align:middle line:84%
in the CIA, in the
diplomatic service.

00:08:46.050 --> 00:08:50.850 align:middle line:84%
And one thing I learned
as I was growing up

00:08:50.850 --> 00:08:55.510 align:middle line:84%
is there is such a thing
as hidden knowledge.

00:08:55.510 --> 00:08:59.290 align:middle line:84%
There are certain
facts about the world

00:08:59.290 --> 00:09:03.660 align:middle line:84%
that most people
are not aware of.

00:09:03.660 --> 00:09:07.920 align:middle line:84%
So I thought,
well, maybe there's

00:09:07.920 --> 00:09:12.350 align:middle line:84%
some archaeological
facts that aren't

00:09:12.350 --> 00:09:15.690 align:middle line:90%
getting through to people.

00:09:15.690 --> 00:09:21.730 align:middle line:84%
And that is what
influenced me to dig deeper

00:09:21.730 --> 00:09:25.350 align:middle line:84%
than the textbooks, to go back
to the original scientific

00:09:25.350 --> 00:09:30.140 align:middle line:84%
reports published by
archaeologists, geologists,

00:09:30.140 --> 00:09:33.940 align:middle line:90%
and other earth scientists.

00:09:33.940 --> 00:09:37.000 align:middle line:84%
Not just from the
more recent years,

00:09:37.000 --> 00:09:41.110 align:middle line:84%
but from the time of Darwin
in the mid 19th century all

00:09:41.110 --> 00:09:43.890 align:middle line:90%
the way up to the present.

00:09:43.890 --> 00:09:48.730 align:middle line:84%
And I also looked not just
in reports in English.

00:09:48.730 --> 00:09:52.900 align:middle line:84%
Because of my education,
I have a reading knowledge

00:09:52.900 --> 00:09:56.670 align:middle line:84%
of German, French,
Italian, Spanish,

00:09:56.670 --> 00:09:58.810 align:middle line:84%
and a lot of other
European languages.

00:09:58.810 --> 00:10:00.300 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: How admirable.

00:10:00.300 --> 00:10:04.845 align:middle line:84%
>>CREMO: So I
decided let me look.

00:10:04.845 --> 00:10:08.920 align:middle line:84%
And I didn't know
what I would find.

00:10:08.920 --> 00:10:11.810 align:middle line:84%
I was thinking
originally maybe I'll

00:10:11.810 --> 00:10:15.110 align:middle line:84%
do eight weeks of research,
I'll find one or two

00:10:15.110 --> 00:10:17.100 align:middle line:90%
interesting facts.

00:10:17.100 --> 00:10:21.180 align:middle line:84%
I'll write a short
article about it,

00:10:21.180 --> 00:10:23.780 align:middle line:84%
and then I'll move
on to something else

00:10:23.780 --> 00:10:25.530 align:middle line:84%
because there's
lots of questions.

00:10:25.530 --> 00:10:30.260 align:middle line:84%
Human origins is just one
question about the world

00:10:30.260 --> 00:10:32.170 align:middle line:90%
that we live.

00:10:32.170 --> 00:10:35.120 align:middle line:84%
But when I started
that research,

00:10:35.120 --> 00:10:40.940 align:middle line:84%
I happened upon one case after
another where archaeologists,

00:10:40.940 --> 00:10:45.340 align:middle line:84%
geologists and
paleontologists were reporting

00:10:45.340 --> 00:10:51.700 align:middle line:84%
finding human bones, human
artifacts, human footprints

00:10:51.700 --> 00:10:54.320 align:middle line:84%
millions of years
old, and this was

00:10:54.320 --> 00:10:57.857 align:middle line:84%
in the professional
scientific literature.

00:10:57.857 --> 00:10:59.940 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: How did you even
locate that literature?

00:10:59.940 --> 00:11:01.519 align:middle line:84%
I mean, what was
that process like?

00:11:01.519 --> 00:11:03.060 align:middle line:84%
You don't need to
belabor it, but I'm

00:11:03.060 --> 00:11:04.550 align:middle line:84%
wondering that
couldn't have just

00:11:04.550 --> 00:11:07.020 align:middle line:84%
been readily
available by Googling.

00:11:07.020 --> 00:11:11.210 align:middle line:84%
>>CREMO: No, it wasn't at
that time when I started this

00:11:11.210 --> 00:11:12.814 align:middle line:90%
research in 1984--

00:11:12.814 --> 00:11:13.480 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:11:13.480 --> 00:11:17.740 align:middle line:84%
>>CREMO: -something you
could come upon by Googling.

00:11:17.740 --> 00:11:20.048 align:middle line:84%
The worldwide web didn't
exist at that time.

00:11:20.048 --> 00:11:20.673 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:11:20.673 --> 00:11:21.890 align:middle line:90%
How did you go about this?

00:11:21.890 --> 00:11:24.450 align:middle line:84%
>>CREMO: So I had a
research assistant

00:11:24.450 --> 00:11:28.410 align:middle line:84%
who was helping
me in my research,

00:11:28.410 --> 00:11:32.780 align:middle line:84%
and I just had a
suspicion that if we

00:11:32.780 --> 00:11:35.720 align:middle line:84%
started looking--
it was just a hunch.

00:11:35.720 --> 00:11:38.850 align:middle line:90%
You could say it was intuition.

00:11:38.850 --> 00:11:43.690 align:middle line:84%
I just had some intuition
that if we started digging

00:11:43.690 --> 00:11:49.840 align:middle line:84%
into the old documents, the
old scientific literatures--

00:11:49.840 --> 00:11:54.720 align:middle line:84%
I was particularly interested
in the literature that

00:11:54.720 --> 00:12:00.080 align:middle line:84%
dated to the time period
immediately after Darwin

00:12:00.080 --> 00:12:02.760 align:middle line:84%
published his book
"The Origin of Species"

00:12:02.760 --> 00:12:09.960 align:middle line:84%
where he was first proposing
ideas that led to the concept

00:12:09.960 --> 00:12:12.360 align:middle line:84%
that human beings
like us evolved

00:12:12.360 --> 00:12:17.530 align:middle line:84%
from primitive ape-like
ancestors fairly recently.

00:12:17.530 --> 00:12:21.950 align:middle line:84%
So I thought during
that time period,

00:12:21.950 --> 00:12:26.880 align:middle line:84%
scientists must have been
going out and looking

00:12:26.880 --> 00:12:29.884 align:middle line:90%
for evidence of missing links--

00:12:29.884 --> 00:12:30.800 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Interesting.

00:12:30.800 --> 00:12:33.920 align:middle line:84%
>>CREMO: -connecting
humans like us

00:12:33.920 --> 00:12:37.020 align:middle line:84%
with more primitive
ape-like human ancestors.

00:12:37.020 --> 00:12:39.240 align:middle line:84%
In other words, I
thought, well, they

00:12:39.240 --> 00:12:41.630 align:middle line:84%
must have been
looking for ape men

00:12:41.630 --> 00:12:45.960 align:middle line:84%
of various kinds in
the fossil record.

00:12:45.960 --> 00:12:52.110 align:middle line:84%
So I wanted to look at
that period in detail,

00:12:52.110 --> 00:12:56.880 align:middle line:84%
so I had my research
assistant get reports

00:12:56.880 --> 00:13:02.620 align:middle line:84%
from the 1860s, the
1870s, the 1880s.

00:13:02.620 --> 00:13:06.760 align:middle line:84%
And I was really
surprised to find

00:13:06.760 --> 00:13:12.310 align:middle line:84%
that these scientists, they
were looking for evidence

00:13:12.310 --> 00:13:16.980 align:middle line:84%
of a missing link, but
they weren't finding it.

00:13:16.980 --> 00:13:20.770 align:middle line:84%
They were finding
evidence that humans

00:13:20.770 --> 00:13:26.900 align:middle line:84%
like us were existing
millions of years ago.

00:13:26.900 --> 00:13:32.474 align:middle line:84%
Now, those reports are no
longer in the textbooks.

00:13:32.474 --> 00:13:33.140 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:13:33.140 --> 00:13:33.920 align:middle line:90%
Were they ever?

00:13:33.920 --> 00:13:36.297 align:middle line:84%
I mean, were they pub-- they
obviously were published

00:13:36.297 --> 00:13:38.130 align:middle line:84%
or you wouldn't have
been able to find them.

00:13:38.130 --> 00:13:42.160 align:middle line:84%
>>CREMO: They were published
in the professional scientific

00:13:42.160 --> 00:13:49.210 align:middle line:84%
literature in the
1860s, 1870s, 1880s.

00:13:49.210 --> 00:13:54.510 align:middle line:84%
There was a key event that
took place in the 1890s.

00:13:54.510 --> 00:13:59.490 align:middle line:84%
That was the first time
that scientists actually

00:13:59.490 --> 00:14:02.870 align:middle line:84%
discovered a fossil
of something that you

00:14:02.870 --> 00:14:06.390 align:middle line:84%
could call an ape man
or a missing link.

00:14:06.390 --> 00:14:11.410 align:middle line:84%
There was a Dutch researcher
named Eugene Dubois.

00:14:11.410 --> 00:14:16.140 align:middle line:84%
He had gone to Indonesia and
he was doing some excavations

00:14:16.140 --> 00:14:21.050 align:middle line:84%
there and he found
in his trenches

00:14:21.050 --> 00:14:27.505 align:middle line:84%
at a place called Trinil in
the country of-- on the island

00:14:27.505 --> 00:14:35.890 align:middle line:84%
of Java, he found an ape-like
skull and a human-like leg bone

00:14:35.890 --> 00:14:37.410 align:middle line:84%
and he put them
together and said

00:14:37.410 --> 00:14:43.480 align:middle line:84%
this is the Java ape man,
Pithecanthropus erectus.

00:14:43.480 --> 00:14:47.240 align:middle line:84%
And that was the first
evidence they really

00:14:47.240 --> 00:14:49.580 align:middle line:90%
found of a missing link.

00:14:49.580 --> 00:14:54.930 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: But you just said an
ape-like skull and a human leg.

00:14:54.930 --> 00:14:57.090 align:middle line:84%
I mean is that what
later was determined,

00:14:57.090 --> 00:15:00.090 align:middle line:84%
or were these found
apart from each other

00:15:00.090 --> 00:15:03.070 align:middle line:90%
or within the same area?

00:15:03.070 --> 00:15:07.700 align:middle line:84%
>>CREMO: Well, they were
found at the same site,

00:15:07.700 --> 00:15:12.100 align:middle line:84%
but they were found about
45 feet from each other.

00:15:12.100 --> 00:15:16.960 align:middle line:84%
And I think what he
found was evidence

00:15:16.960 --> 00:15:21.250 align:middle line:84%
that humans like
us were coexisting

00:15:21.250 --> 00:15:27.220 align:middle line:84%
with ape men over 800,000
years ago in Java.

00:15:27.220 --> 00:15:32.240 align:middle line:84%
And, you know, the
reason I say that is

00:15:32.240 --> 00:15:38.480 align:middle line:84%
that scientists in the 1970s
carefully studied the thigh

00:15:38.480 --> 00:15:43.730 align:middle line:84%
bone or femur that Dubois
had found at the Trinil site

00:15:43.730 --> 00:15:47.050 align:middle line:84%
in Java, and they
had determined it

00:15:47.050 --> 00:15:53.750 align:middle line:84%
was identical to a
modern human femur

00:15:53.750 --> 00:15:57.560 align:middle line:90%
in every aspect of its anatomy.

00:15:57.560 --> 00:16:04.530 align:middle line:84%
And it was completely different
from any type of ape man femur

00:16:04.530 --> 00:16:10.260 align:middle line:84%
or thigh bone that had been
found subsequent to that.

00:16:10.260 --> 00:16:16.399 align:middle line:84%
But in the 19th century, Dubois
put the two together and said--

00:16:16.399 --> 00:16:17.940 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Here's
you're missing link.

00:16:17.940 --> 00:16:20.700 align:middle line:84%
>>CREMO: -here's
the Java Ape Man.

00:16:20.700 --> 00:16:25.750 align:middle line:84%
So that was a key event in
the history of archaeology.

00:16:25.750 --> 00:16:26.497 align:middle line:90%
So--

00:16:26.497 --> 00:16:28.080 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And was
that taken seriously

00:16:28.080 --> 00:16:31.120 align:middle line:84%
by the international
archaeological community?

00:16:31.120 --> 00:16:35.690 align:middle line:84%
>>CREMO: It was after
some time of controversy,

00:16:35.690 --> 00:16:37.760 align:middle line:90%
it was taken seriously.

00:16:37.760 --> 00:16:42.110 align:middle line:84%
So then they had to
decide what to do

00:16:42.110 --> 00:16:47.150 align:middle line:84%
with all the evidence that
had previously been reported

00:16:47.150 --> 00:16:52.130 align:middle line:84%
in the scientific publications
about human bones,

00:16:52.130 --> 00:16:58.010 align:middle line:84%
human footprints, and human
artifacts that had been found

00:16:58.010 --> 00:17:01.540 align:middle line:84%
in layers of rock
millions of years old.

00:17:01.540 --> 00:17:06.609 align:middle line:84%
You know, if you have
your ape man missing

00:17:06.609 --> 00:17:13.780 align:middle line:84%
link at 800,000 years, or maybe
as much as a million years,

00:17:13.780 --> 00:17:16.300 align:middle line:84%
then modern humans
would have to have

00:17:16.300 --> 00:17:19.800 align:middle line:84%
come into existence
sometime after that.

00:17:19.800 --> 00:17:26.390 align:middle line:84%
So that's when, I think, a
process of knowledge filtration

00:17:26.390 --> 00:17:28.550 align:middle line:84%
began in the world
of science where

00:17:28.550 --> 00:17:35.230 align:middle line:84%
they began eliminating all of
these other previous reports

00:17:35.230 --> 00:17:40.010 align:middle line:84%
from scientific discussion
about human origins.

00:17:40.010 --> 00:17:46.720 align:middle line:84%
And then after that period of
time, in the late 19th century

00:17:46.720 --> 00:17:52.590 align:middle line:84%
and early 20th century, whenever
any scientist would find

00:17:52.590 --> 00:17:58.470 align:middle line:84%
evidence for a human presence
going back further than

00:17:58.470 --> 00:18:01.020 align:middle line:84%
would be expected,
it would either

00:18:01.020 --> 00:18:07.020 align:middle line:84%
be reinterpreted or
dismissed or explained away

00:18:07.020 --> 00:18:10.925 align:middle line:90%
in a very unfair way.

00:18:10.925 --> 00:18:12.300 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: What I
don't understand

00:18:12.300 --> 00:18:18.420 align:middle line:84%
is why that one particular
event, the Java finding,

00:18:18.420 --> 00:18:21.810 align:middle line:84%
had so much more traction than
all of this other evidence.

00:18:21.810 --> 00:18:24.580 align:middle line:84%
Was it more political
in that Darwinism

00:18:24.580 --> 00:18:26.920 align:middle line:84%
was starting to take
roots philosophically

00:18:26.920 --> 00:18:31.020 align:middle line:84%
and within the educational
system, or why?

00:18:31.020 --> 00:18:38.320 align:middle line:84%
>>CREMO: Well, I think
it was part of a process,

00:18:38.320 --> 00:18:43.320 align:middle line:84%
as you're indicating, a more
cultural and political process

00:18:43.320 --> 00:18:48.690 align:middle line:84%
whereby the leading
intellectuals in the world

00:18:48.690 --> 00:18:54.360 align:middle line:84%
were searching for ways
to explain human origins

00:18:54.360 --> 00:18:59.120 align:middle line:90%
in a purely materialistic way.

00:18:59.120 --> 00:19:07.490 align:middle line:84%
And I think this discovery
served those interests.

00:19:07.490 --> 00:19:08.920 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Mm-hm.

00:19:08.920 --> 00:19:09.810 align:middle line:90%
Gotcha.

00:19:09.810 --> 00:19:15.300 align:middle line:84%
So the other evidence was put
away in vaults and libraries,

00:19:15.300 --> 00:19:16.400 align:middle line:90%
I take it?

00:19:16.400 --> 00:19:17.360 align:middle line:90%
>>CREMO: Yeah.

00:19:17.360 --> 00:19:23.020 align:middle line:84%
And if you're not
aware of this evidence,

00:19:23.020 --> 00:19:24.616 align:middle line:84%
it's very difficult
to track down.

00:19:24.616 --> 00:19:25.240 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Sure.

00:19:25.240 --> 00:19:27.900 align:middle line:84%
>>CREMO: It's one reason I
put it all together in a book

00:19:27.900 --> 00:19:29.450 align:middle line:90%
called "Forbidden Archeology-"

00:19:29.450 --> 00:19:32.090 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: It's amazing,
900 plus pages.

00:19:32.090 --> 00:19:32.800 align:middle line:90%
Amazing book.

00:19:32.800 --> 00:19:36.740 align:middle line:84%
>>CREMO: -to make this
evidence accessible to people,

00:19:36.740 --> 00:19:40.870 align:middle line:84%
so that they have a complete
set of facts with which

00:19:40.870 --> 00:19:49.550 align:middle line:84%
to make their judgments about
human origins and antiquity.

00:19:49.550 --> 00:19:51.710 align:middle line:84%
If you look in the
current textbooks,

00:19:51.710 --> 00:19:54.990 align:middle line:84%
you only see the
facts that support

00:19:54.990 --> 00:19:59.470 align:middle line:84%
the current dominant
evolutionary ideas

00:19:59.470 --> 00:20:01.262 align:middle line:90%
about human origins.

00:20:01.262 --> 00:20:02.150 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:20:02.150 --> 00:20:05.580 align:middle line:84%
As you say in your book, a
Judeo Christian timeline.

00:20:05.580 --> 00:20:10.230 align:middle line:84%
>>CREMO: Well, I think that also
has something to do with it.

00:20:10.230 --> 00:20:17.630 align:middle line:84%
That modern science grew up
against a Judeo Christian

00:20:17.630 --> 00:20:24.230 align:middle line:84%
cultural background, and
that cultural background

00:20:24.230 --> 00:20:29.080 align:middle line:84%
has a linear
progressive time concept

00:20:29.080 --> 00:20:36.040 align:middle line:84%
where if you look at it,
there is a beginning creation,

00:20:36.040 --> 00:20:40.460 align:middle line:84%
there's a fall, there's
a deliverance, and then

00:20:40.460 --> 00:20:42.600 align:middle line:90%
a last judgment.

00:20:42.600 --> 00:20:45.410 align:middle line:90%
It all happens just once.

00:20:45.410 --> 00:20:51.899 align:middle line:84%
But many other cultures have
a cyclical concept of time.

00:20:51.899 --> 00:20:53.440 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: If you
would, explain that.

00:20:53.440 --> 00:20:55.410 align:middle line:84%
I think this would
be a good time.

00:20:55.410 --> 00:20:59.740 align:middle line:84%
You've started entering
the subject of the evidence

00:20:59.740 --> 00:21:01.520 align:middle line:90%
itself a moment ago.

00:21:01.520 --> 00:21:05.580 align:middle line:84%
Now let's go back to the earlier
part of the conversation,

00:21:05.580 --> 00:21:08.810 align:middle line:84%
and if you could explain
to us who don't understand

00:21:08.810 --> 00:21:14.180 align:middle line:84%
the Vedic texts and the Puranas,
what that timeline looked like,

00:21:14.180 --> 00:21:18.130 align:middle line:84%
the cyclical nature of
that history looks like.

00:21:18.130 --> 00:21:21.620 align:middle line:84%
Enough that it intrigued you
to even begin this research.

00:21:21.620 --> 00:21:22.970 align:middle line:90%
>>CREMO: Yeah.

00:21:22.970 --> 00:21:28.910 align:middle line:84%
Well, we all have to
deal with time cycles.

00:21:28.910 --> 00:21:31.830 align:middle line:84%
I mean one cycle
of time that we all

00:21:31.830 --> 00:21:36.590 align:middle line:84%
have to deal with is
the day-night cycle.

00:21:36.590 --> 00:21:40.110 align:middle line:84%
During the day, we're
active for most of us.

00:21:40.110 --> 00:21:43.580 align:middle line:84%
During the night we're
sleeping or dreaming.

00:21:43.580 --> 00:21:49.770 align:middle line:84%
There's also a seasonal cycle
in the temperate climates

00:21:49.770 --> 00:21:51.110 align:middle line:90%
of the world.

00:21:51.110 --> 00:21:56.810 align:middle line:84%
You go through spring,
summer, fall, winter

00:21:56.810 --> 00:22:00.100 align:middle line:84%
and you adjust your
consciousness and behavior

00:22:00.100 --> 00:22:05.030 align:middle line:84%
according to what part of
the seasonal cycle you're in.

00:22:05.030 --> 00:22:11.940 align:middle line:84%
Many of the ancient people were
aware of even larger cycles

00:22:11.940 --> 00:22:13.730 align:middle line:90%
of time.

00:22:13.730 --> 00:22:17.460 align:middle line:84%
The Mayan people had a
cyclical concept of time.

00:22:17.460 --> 00:22:21.807 align:middle line:84%
The ancient Greeks and Romans
had a cyclical concept of time.

00:22:21.807 --> 00:22:22.640 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Egyptians.

00:22:22.640 --> 00:22:25.890 align:middle line:90%
>>CREMO: The Egyptians.

00:22:25.890 --> 00:22:28.810 align:middle line:84%
And the people of
ancient India also

00:22:28.810 --> 00:22:33.320 align:middle line:84%
had a cyclical concept of
time, and the basic unit

00:22:33.320 --> 00:22:36.530 align:middle line:84%
of that cyclical
concept of time was

00:22:36.530 --> 00:22:42.560 align:middle line:84%
called the kalpa, or
the day of Brahma.

00:22:42.560 --> 00:22:51.300 align:middle line:84%
And it lasts about four
billion 320 million years.

00:22:51.300 --> 00:22:55.150 align:middle line:84%
It's followed by
a night of Brahma,

00:22:55.150 --> 00:23:01.006 align:middle line:84%
which also last for four
billion 320 million years.

00:23:01.006 --> 00:23:03.130 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So we're looking
at a total of about nine

00:23:03.130 --> 00:23:05.440 align:middle line:84%
billion years, and
how many cycles

00:23:05.440 --> 00:23:07.390 align:middle line:90%
are recognized or acknowledged?

00:23:07.390 --> 00:23:09.650 align:middle line:84%
>>CREMO: Well,
the cycle goes on.

00:23:09.650 --> 00:23:12.880 align:middle line:84%
It repeats time after
time after time.

00:23:12.880 --> 00:23:16.310 align:middle line:84%
After a night of Brahma,
there's another day of Brahma.

00:23:16.310 --> 00:23:20.310 align:middle line:84%
And according to
the Vedic cosmology,

00:23:20.310 --> 00:23:28.140 align:middle line:84%
during the days of Brahma,
life, including human life,

00:23:28.140 --> 00:23:31.860 align:middle line:90%
is manifest in the cosmos.

00:23:31.860 --> 00:23:38.260 align:middle line:84%
And during the night of Brahma,
it's dormant, or unmanifest.

00:23:38.260 --> 00:23:42.960 align:middle line:84%
So according to the Vedic
cosmological calendar,

00:23:42.960 --> 00:23:49.080 align:middle line:84%
we're now about halfway
through the current kalpa,

00:23:49.080 --> 00:23:52.780 align:middle line:90%
or day of Brahma.

00:23:52.780 --> 00:23:57.740 align:middle line:84%
And that means a
Vedic archaeologist

00:23:57.740 --> 00:24:03.740 align:middle line:84%
would expect to find evidence
for a human presence going back

00:24:03.740 --> 00:24:06.380 align:middle line:84%
to the beginning
of the kalpa, which

00:24:06.380 --> 00:24:09.200 align:middle line:84%
would be about 2
billion years ago.

00:24:09.200 --> 00:24:13.100 align:middle line:84%
As I said, the whole kalpa
is about four billion

00:24:13.100 --> 00:24:14.870 align:middle line:90%
320 million years.

00:24:14.870 --> 00:24:16.700 align:middle line:90%
We're halfway through it.

00:24:16.700 --> 00:24:24.620 align:middle line:84%
That means it began a little
over 2 billion years ago.

00:24:24.620 --> 00:24:27.760 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So that would be the
daytime kalpa in which things

00:24:27.760 --> 00:24:31.300 align:middle line:84%
are nourished and
flourish and life grows.

00:24:31.300 --> 00:24:32.870 align:middle line:90%
>>CREMO: Including human life.

00:24:32.870 --> 00:24:34.161 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Including human life.

00:24:34.161 --> 00:24:38.650 align:middle line:84%
So what does the nighttime
kalpa represent then?

00:24:38.650 --> 00:24:42.240 align:middle line:84%
>>CREMO: That
represents a time when

00:24:42.240 --> 00:24:47.106 align:middle line:84%
the lifeforms are all
in a dormant state.

00:24:47.106 --> 00:24:48.730 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Does this
follow catastrophe?

00:24:48.730 --> 00:24:51.249 align:middle line:84%
Is that often the
bridge between the two?

00:24:51.249 --> 00:24:51.790 align:middle line:90%
>>CREMO: Yes.

00:24:51.790 --> 00:24:55.600 align:middle line:84%
According to the
Vedic cosmology,

00:24:55.600 --> 00:25:03.480 align:middle line:84%
there are periodic catastrophes
that influence life on Earth;

00:25:03.480 --> 00:25:10.280 align:middle line:84%
however, the information
that allows the whole system

00:25:10.280 --> 00:25:17.360 align:middle line:84%
to boot up again is still
there on some higher level.

00:25:17.360 --> 00:25:20.950 align:middle line:84%
A lot of people today
are interested in what

00:25:20.950 --> 00:25:23.190 align:middle line:90%
they call cloud computing.

00:25:23.190 --> 00:25:26.566 align:middle line:84%
That means they keep
their files and programs

00:25:26.566 --> 00:25:32.680 align:middle line:84%
on the cloud-- in the
cloud as they put it,

00:25:32.680 --> 00:25:41.100 align:middle line:84%
which means even if you lose
the content on your device,

00:25:41.100 --> 00:25:45.590 align:middle line:84%
it's still there so
that you can access it.

00:25:45.590 --> 00:25:49.050 align:middle line:84%
So the information
and intelligence

00:25:49.050 --> 00:25:57.150 align:middle line:84%
that's required to start up life
again on this level of reality

00:25:57.150 --> 00:26:02.960 align:middle line:84%
is always there on this
higher level of reality.

00:26:02.960 --> 00:26:09.060 align:middle line:84%
And there are intelligences
there who can do that.

00:26:09.060 --> 00:26:13.440 align:middle line:84%
They can boot up
the system again.

00:26:13.440 --> 00:26:16.160 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And would
this also account

00:26:16.160 --> 00:26:20.790 align:middle line:84%
for the conversations around
the existence of Atlantis

00:26:20.790 --> 00:26:24.170 align:middle line:84%
and Lemuria and other
ancient cultures, which

00:26:24.170 --> 00:26:26.900 align:middle line:84%
have disappeared
from the map, as it

00:26:26.900 --> 00:26:29.850 align:middle line:84%
were, due to
cataclysm or whatnot?

00:26:29.850 --> 00:26:31.520 align:middle line:90%
>>CREMO: Yes.

00:26:31.520 --> 00:26:35.660 align:middle line:84%
There are many
accounts of cataclysms.

00:26:35.660 --> 00:26:39.710 align:middle line:84%
And within the Vedic
cosmology, there

00:26:39.710 --> 00:26:42.760 align:middle line:84%
are cycles within
cycles within cycles.

00:26:42.760 --> 00:26:49.690 align:middle line:84%
I had mentioned to you the
major time cycle called

00:26:49.690 --> 00:26:56.300 align:middle line:84%
the kalpa, which lasts for
four billion 320 million years.

00:26:56.300 --> 00:27:00.637 align:middle line:84%
Within the kalpa, there
are further cycles--

00:27:00.637 --> 00:27:01.720 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: The yuga cycles.

00:27:01.720 --> 00:27:05.930 align:middle line:84%
>>CREMO: -called
manvantaras and yugas.

00:27:05.930 --> 00:27:08.630 align:middle line:84%
For example, within
the kalpa, there

00:27:08.630 --> 00:27:14.920 align:middle line:84%
are 14 manvantara periods,
each lasting about 300 million

00:27:14.920 --> 00:27:16.170 align:middle line:90%
years.

00:27:16.170 --> 00:27:21.020 align:middle line:84%
And after each manvantara,
there is a devastation.

00:27:21.020 --> 00:27:26.400 align:middle line:84%
And the manvantaras are
made up of yuga cycles,

00:27:26.400 --> 00:27:30.580 align:middle line:84%
and there can also be
devastations there.

00:27:30.580 --> 00:27:37.375 align:middle line:84%
So many cultures have
the idea that there

00:27:37.375 --> 00:27:43.010 align:middle line:84%
are-- there have existed cities
with a high level of culture

00:27:43.010 --> 00:27:50.430 align:middle line:84%
and civilization that have
now gone under the water.

00:27:50.430 --> 00:27:52.990 align:middle line:90%
Atlantis is one of them.

00:27:52.990 --> 00:27:55.960 align:middle line:90%
Lemuria is another.

00:27:55.960 --> 00:28:01.410 align:middle line:84%
In India, there's the story
of the city of Dwarka,

00:28:01.410 --> 00:28:04.780 align:middle line:84%
which was the city
of Lord Krishna.

00:28:04.780 --> 00:28:08.320 align:middle line:84%
It was a beautiful city with
a very high level of culture

00:28:08.320 --> 00:28:13.990 align:middle line:84%
and civilization that
went under the water

00:28:13.990 --> 00:28:17.480 align:middle line:90%
about 5,000 years ago.

00:28:17.480 --> 00:28:19.030 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Where was it located?

00:28:19.030 --> 00:28:23.240 align:middle line:84%
>>CREMO: It was located
in Northwestern India.

00:28:23.240 --> 00:28:27.010 align:middle line:84%
There's still a
city named Dwarka

00:28:27.010 --> 00:28:33.720 align:middle line:84%
in Northwestern India in
the Gujarat state now,

00:28:33.720 --> 00:28:36.240 align:middle line:90%
but it's interesting.

00:28:36.240 --> 00:28:43.460 align:middle line:84%
Archaeologists have done
dives off the coast of Dwarka,

00:28:43.460 --> 00:28:45.420 align:middle line:84%
the present city
of Dwarka, which

00:28:45.420 --> 00:28:48.610 align:middle line:84%
has the same name
as the ancient city.

00:28:48.610 --> 00:28:53.150 align:middle line:84%
And offshore under
the water, they

00:28:53.150 --> 00:28:57.570 align:middle line:84%
have found the remains
of an ancient city.

00:28:57.570 --> 00:29:02.040 align:middle line:84%
It would be like finding
the remains of Atlantis,

00:29:02.040 --> 00:29:04.130 align:middle line:90%
for example.

00:29:04.130 --> 00:29:04.860 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:29:04.860 --> 00:29:05.630 align:middle line:90%
Fascinating.

00:29:05.630 --> 00:29:12.220 align:middle line:84%
OK, now let's go back then
to the more modern times

00:29:12.220 --> 00:29:16.830 align:middle line:84%
and let's talk about Darwin
and his partner Alfred Russel

00:29:16.830 --> 00:29:17.642 align:middle line:90%
Wendell?

00:29:17.642 --> 00:29:18.350 align:middle line:90%
>>CREMO: Wallace.

00:29:18.350 --> 00:29:19.100 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Wallace.

00:29:19.100 --> 00:29:19.630 align:middle line:90%
Wallace.

00:29:19.630 --> 00:29:21.750 align:middle line:90%
>>CREMO: Alfred Russel Wallace.

00:29:21.750 --> 00:29:26.830 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And Wallace
and Darwin were not

00:29:26.830 --> 00:29:33.240 align:middle line:84%
exactly on the same page
once all of the dust settled.

00:29:33.240 --> 00:29:36.069 align:middle line:84%
Wallace had a different
viewpoint than Darwin.

00:29:36.069 --> 00:29:36.610 align:middle line:90%
>>CREMO: Yes.

00:29:36.610 --> 00:29:38.410 align:middle line:84%
Well, it's interesting
what happened.

00:29:38.410 --> 00:29:42.870 align:middle line:84%
They had a very
interesting relationship.

00:29:42.870 --> 00:29:47.150 align:middle line:84%
Darwin had gone on
this expedition where

00:29:47.150 --> 00:29:51.310 align:middle line:84%
he sailed around the world
to the Galapagos Islands

00:29:51.310 --> 00:29:53.870 align:middle line:84%
and places like that,
and that's where he first

00:29:53.870 --> 00:29:58.200 align:middle line:90%
got this idea of evolution.

00:29:58.200 --> 00:30:03.840 align:middle line:84%
So he went back to England
and he began writing a book,

00:30:03.840 --> 00:30:06.390 align:middle line:90%
but it took him about 20 years.

00:30:06.390 --> 00:30:12.530 align:middle line:84%
After 20 years, he still had
not published his theory.

00:30:12.530 --> 00:30:17.990 align:middle line:84%
And he was sitting in England
and one day he got a letter

00:30:17.990 --> 00:30:23.610 align:middle line:84%
from Wallace, another
scientist, a younger scientist,

00:30:23.610 --> 00:30:28.490 align:middle line:84%
in which he found
a paper outlining

00:30:28.490 --> 00:30:32.440 align:middle line:84%
the theory of evolution
by natural selection.

00:30:32.440 --> 00:30:36.200 align:middle line:84%
And Wallace said he
was going to present it

00:30:36.200 --> 00:30:41.080 align:middle line:84%
at a meeting of a scientific
society in England

00:30:41.080 --> 00:30:42.680 align:middle line:90%
and get it published.

00:30:42.680 --> 00:30:46.800 align:middle line:84%
And Darwin, at that
time, was just shocked.

00:30:46.800 --> 00:30:52.390 align:middle line:84%
He'd been working on this theory
of evolution for 20 years.

00:30:52.390 --> 00:30:55.370 align:middle line:84%
And the way it works
in the scientific world

00:30:55.370 --> 00:31:01.310 align:middle line:84%
is that the first person
who publishes the theory

00:31:01.310 --> 00:31:05.230 align:middle line:90%
gets their name on it.

00:31:05.230 --> 00:31:10.670 align:middle line:84%
So Darwin called all of his
scientific friends together

00:31:10.670 --> 00:31:14.140 align:middle line:90%
and told them what had happened.

00:31:14.140 --> 00:31:17.420 align:middle line:84%
And they said, well, there's
only one thing you could really

00:31:17.420 --> 00:31:25.700 align:middle line:84%
do is you could ask Wallace
if along with his paper

00:31:25.700 --> 00:31:30.410 align:middle line:84%
a paper by you, Darwin,
could also be presented

00:31:30.410 --> 00:31:34.620 align:middle line:84%
at the same meeting of
this scientific society.

00:31:34.620 --> 00:31:38.200 align:middle line:84%
It was called the Linnean
Society in England.

00:31:38.200 --> 00:31:46.900 align:middle line:84%
And that way, you could both
publish at the same time

00:31:46.900 --> 00:31:52.610 align:middle line:84%
and then you would be the
joint authors of the theory.

00:31:52.610 --> 00:31:58.710 align:middle line:84%
And for a long time, the theory
was called the Wallace Darwin

00:31:58.710 --> 00:32:02.240 align:middle line:90%
Theory of Evolution.

00:32:02.240 --> 00:32:05.140 align:middle line:84%
But now, it's just
called the Darwin theory.

00:32:05.140 --> 00:32:07.180 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: How did
Wallace get axed?

00:32:07.180 --> 00:32:11.620 align:middle line:84%
>>CREMO: Well, he
was a scientist,

00:32:11.620 --> 00:32:16.090 align:middle line:84%
but he was a very
open-minded scientist.

00:32:16.090 --> 00:32:23.450 align:middle line:84%
Now Darwin was pretty strictly
materialist in his outlook,

00:32:23.450 --> 00:32:27.460 align:middle line:84%
so he wanted to
explain everything

00:32:27.460 --> 00:32:31.570 align:middle line:84%
in terms of ordinary
matter operating

00:32:31.570 --> 00:32:38.260 align:middle line:84%
according to purely
materialistic scientific laws

00:32:38.260 --> 00:32:41.430 align:middle line:90%
of physics and chemistry.

00:32:41.430 --> 00:32:47.700 align:middle line:84%
Now Wallace, in his
scientific research,

00:32:47.700 --> 00:32:52.760 align:middle line:84%
could see that there
is more to this world,

00:32:52.760 --> 00:32:57.890 align:middle line:84%
there's more to living things
that just ordinary matter,

00:32:57.890 --> 00:33:00.030 align:middle line:90%
the chemical elements.

00:33:00.030 --> 00:33:04.720 align:middle line:84%
He could see that there were
subtle elements involved,

00:33:04.720 --> 00:33:07.820 align:middle line:84%
that there was some kind
of guiding intelligence.

00:33:07.820 --> 00:33:14.360 align:middle line:84%
This is another thing that
separated him from Darwin.

00:33:14.360 --> 00:33:16.969 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Wasn't he into
psychic type of research--

00:33:16.969 --> 00:33:17.510 align:middle line:90%
>>CREMO: Yes.

00:33:17.510 --> 00:33:20.400 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: -in the day, so he
was really trying to test it.

00:33:20.400 --> 00:33:21.650 align:middle line:90%
>>CREMO: Yes, he was.

00:33:21.650 --> 00:33:30.090 align:middle line:84%
And he worked with another
English scientist, Sir William

00:33:30.090 --> 00:33:33.660 align:middle line:84%
Crookes, who was later
a president of the Royal

00:33:33.660 --> 00:33:38.160 align:middle line:84%
Society, England's top most
scientific organization.

00:33:38.160 --> 00:33:44.560 align:middle line:84%
And together, they were doing
experiments with mediums.

00:33:44.560 --> 00:33:50.840 align:middle line:84%
There was a medium named
Daniel Dunglass Home,

00:33:50.840 --> 00:33:55.720 align:middle line:84%
and this man had
psychokinetic abilities,

00:33:55.720 --> 00:33:58.480 align:middle line:90%
mind over matter abilities.

00:33:58.480 --> 00:34:01.310 align:middle line:84%
And they did
experiments with him

00:34:01.310 --> 00:34:08.170 align:middle line:84%
in which they verified these
psychokinetic abilities,

00:34:08.170 --> 00:34:11.900 align:middle line:84%
and they published
their results.

00:34:11.900 --> 00:34:17.480 align:middle line:84%
Now, when that happened,
Darwin told Wallace,

00:34:17.480 --> 00:34:22.280 align:middle line:84%
I think you're killing our
child, the Theory of Evolution,

00:34:22.280 --> 00:34:27.150 align:middle line:84%
by getting into these
paranormal topics.

00:34:27.150 --> 00:34:34.560 align:middle line:84%
So they had a kind of
intellectual divorce.

00:34:34.560 --> 00:34:40.350 align:middle line:84%
And I think of the two,
Wallace was actually

00:34:40.350 --> 00:34:44.030 align:middle line:90%
the better scientist.

00:34:44.030 --> 00:34:48.159 align:middle line:84%
Darwin, I think, was
objecting to these things

00:34:48.159 --> 00:34:55.380 align:middle line:84%
because he wanted to have a
science that was based strictly

00:34:55.380 --> 00:35:05.750 align:middle line:84%
on matter and material laws
with no intelligence involved.

00:35:05.750 --> 00:35:12.040 align:middle line:84%
Whereas Wallace was prepared
to have a science that

00:35:12.040 --> 00:35:15.460 align:middle line:84%
included not just
the ordinary material

00:35:15.460 --> 00:35:20.000 align:middle line:84%
elements, but subtle
material elements,

00:35:20.000 --> 00:35:25.850 align:middle line:84%
mental and intellectual
energies, and the energy

00:35:25.850 --> 00:35:29.770 align:middle line:84%
of the consciousness, which
is purely non-material.

00:35:29.770 --> 00:35:31.730 align:middle line:84%
And he was prepared
to accept that there

00:35:31.730 --> 00:35:38.050 align:middle line:84%
were various levels of conscious
entities in the cosmos,

00:35:38.050 --> 00:35:45.040 align:middle line:84%
and that conscious entities on
the higher levels of the cosmos

00:35:45.040 --> 00:35:51.070 align:middle line:84%
had influence on
the history of life.

00:35:51.070 --> 00:35:56.420 align:middle line:84%
And these were things that
Darwin just could not accept.

00:35:56.420 --> 00:36:03.270 align:middle line:84%
Now, I think of the two, Wallace
was the better scientist.

00:36:03.270 --> 00:36:06.650 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: One of the lines in
your book, it said in the end,

00:36:06.650 --> 00:36:09.157 align:middle line:84%
he believed that the will
of higher intelligence

00:36:09.157 --> 00:36:09.990 align:middle line:90%
formed the universe.

00:36:09.990 --> 00:36:13.420 align:middle line:84%
It was a very simple statement
I underlined out of your book.

00:36:13.420 --> 00:36:15.260 align:middle line:84%
That was essentially
what he came to--

00:36:15.260 --> 00:36:15.810 align:middle line:90%
>>CREMO: Yes.

00:36:15.810 --> 00:36:17.560 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: -through the
mechanisms you just

00:36:17.560 --> 00:36:20.190 align:middle line:84%
mentioned a bit
ago, complex systems

00:36:20.190 --> 00:36:22.980 align:middle line:84%
that have time to foment,
guided by intelligence.

00:36:22.980 --> 00:36:25.940 align:middle line:84%
>>CREMO: And these are
debates that still go on today

00:36:25.940 --> 00:36:26.940 align:middle line:90%
in the world of science.

00:36:26.940 --> 00:36:28.690 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: I interviewed a
man named Bernard Haisch, who

00:36:28.690 --> 00:36:29.930 align:middle line:90%
wrote "The God Theory."

00:36:29.930 --> 00:36:32.800 align:middle line:84%
And basically, he's in
the world of physics

00:36:32.800 --> 00:36:34.950 align:middle line:84%
and coming to a
very similar place

00:36:34.950 --> 00:36:36.920 align:middle line:90%
in his community of physicists.

00:36:36.920 --> 00:36:39.383 align:middle line:84%
>>CREMO: Yeah, but it's very
much against the mainstream

00:36:39.383 --> 00:36:39.883 align:middle line:90%
ideas.

00:36:39.883 --> 00:36:40.610 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:36:40.610 --> 00:36:44.320 align:middle line:84%
>>CREMO: Now, some
people-- in one sense,

00:36:44.320 --> 00:36:50.000 align:middle line:84%
it's just a question of
treating science as a game.

00:36:50.000 --> 00:36:56.200 align:middle line:84%
And one of the rules in the
game as it's played today

00:36:56.200 --> 00:37:02.420 align:middle line:84%
is you can't introduce
non-material substances

00:37:02.420 --> 00:37:04.420 align:middle line:90%
beyond the chemical elements.

00:37:04.420 --> 00:37:05.240 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:37:05.240 --> 00:37:10.120 align:middle line:84%
>>CREMO: Another rule is
that you can't introduce

00:37:10.120 --> 00:37:15.000 align:middle line:84%
conscious agency in
your explanations of how

00:37:15.000 --> 00:37:18.160 align:middle line:90%
things come into being.

00:37:18.160 --> 00:37:20.580 align:middle line:90%
So those are two rules.

00:37:20.580 --> 00:37:29.480 align:middle line:84%
But my position is that science
should deal with everything

00:37:29.480 --> 00:37:35.980 align:middle line:84%
that's possibly true about
the world that we live in.

00:37:35.980 --> 00:37:38.880 align:middle line:84%
And I think both
of these things,

00:37:38.880 --> 00:37:45.420 align:middle line:84%
non-material substances
and intelligent agency,

00:37:45.420 --> 00:37:51.040 align:middle line:84%
are two things that are
possibly true about the world

00:37:51.040 --> 00:37:52.500 align:middle line:90%
that we live in.

00:37:52.500 --> 00:37:57.210 align:middle line:84%
And if we're going to have a
complete scientific description

00:37:57.210 --> 00:38:01.930 align:middle line:84%
of reality, we
shouldn't artificially

00:38:01.930 --> 00:38:03.080 align:middle line:90%
exclude these things.

00:38:03.080 --> 00:38:07.880 align:middle line:84%
And it's one reason
I admire Wallace.

00:38:07.880 --> 00:38:08.490 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:38:08.490 --> 00:38:14.550 align:middle line:84%
>>CREMO: Because he had
the courage as a scientist

00:38:14.550 --> 00:38:18.760 align:middle line:84%
to introduce
non-material substance

00:38:18.760 --> 00:38:24.370 align:middle line:84%
and intelligent agency into
his scientific worldview.

00:38:24.370 --> 00:38:29.760 align:middle line:84%
In other words, he
was bringing together

00:38:29.760 --> 00:38:36.210 align:middle line:84%
his science and his religion,
or spiritual commitments, which

00:38:36.210 --> 00:38:41.980 align:middle line:84%
I think is a really
good example.

00:38:41.980 --> 00:38:42.709 align:middle line:90%
So--

00:38:42.709 --> 00:38:45.000 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Well, and it creates
a bridge between the two

00:38:45.000 --> 00:38:47.890 align:middle line:84%
so people don't have to
live in this perpetual state

00:38:47.890 --> 00:38:49.321 align:middle line:90%
of conflict.

00:38:49.321 --> 00:38:49.820 align:middle line:90%
Right?

00:38:49.820 --> 00:38:50.470 align:middle line:90%
>>CREMO: Right.

00:38:50.470 --> 00:38:52.303 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: I mean, you
have a spiritual life,

00:38:52.303 --> 00:38:55.320 align:middle line:84%
which is nonsensical in
the world of science.

00:38:55.320 --> 00:38:58.820 align:middle line:84%
And yet, I don't know if
it's most people any longer,

00:38:58.820 --> 00:39:02.320 align:middle line:84%
but a very large percentage
of the population

00:39:02.320 --> 00:39:05.440 align:middle line:84%
is fully committed to
both of those belief

00:39:05.440 --> 00:39:08.400 align:middle line:84%
systems, the science
and their religion,

00:39:08.400 --> 00:39:10.020 align:middle line:84%
and that really
starts breaking down

00:39:10.020 --> 00:39:14.190 align:middle line:84%
a coherence inside the
person's own intellect.

00:39:14.190 --> 00:39:16.000 align:middle line:84%
>>CREMO: Yeah, I
mean, I've personally

00:39:16.000 --> 00:39:22.531 align:middle line:84%
made a decision where
I put the two together.

00:39:22.531 --> 00:39:23.030 align:middle line:90%
And--

00:39:23.030 --> 00:39:24.529 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: But you
did the hard work.

00:39:24.529 --> 00:39:27.370 align:middle line:84%
You did the research so that you
could even justify doing that.

00:39:27.370 --> 00:39:30.660 align:middle line:84%
Not only justify it,
you could prove it out

00:39:30.660 --> 00:39:34.050 align:middle line:84%
in the scientific arena,
create that bridge for others

00:39:34.050 --> 00:39:34.800 align:middle line:90%
to do the same.

00:39:34.800 --> 00:39:37.090 align:middle line:84%
And compiling that in
your book was amazing,

00:39:37.090 --> 00:39:39.010 align:middle line:90%
in "Forbidden Archeology."

00:39:39.010 --> 00:39:42.060 align:middle line:84%
Just an amazing job
of what you did.

00:39:42.060 --> 00:39:43.740 align:middle line:90%
It's highly detailed.

00:39:43.740 --> 00:39:45.400 align:middle line:84%
You're not just
putting forth a theory.

00:39:45.400 --> 00:39:48.740 align:middle line:84%
All the evidence, all the
debates in the day and so

00:39:48.740 --> 00:39:53.210 align:middle line:84%
forth are all present
for a person to evaluate.

00:39:53.210 --> 00:39:55.647 align:middle line:84%
That's the heavy
lifting in this way.

00:39:55.647 --> 00:39:56.230 align:middle line:90%
>>CREMO: Yeah.

00:39:56.230 --> 00:40:01.190 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Most people don't
have the means to do that.

00:40:01.190 --> 00:40:04.120 align:middle line:84%
>>CREMO: You know, when
I started that research,

00:40:04.120 --> 00:40:09.850 align:middle line:84%
I didn't know that I would be
able to find any such evidence.

00:40:09.850 --> 00:40:16.350 align:middle line:84%
Now, I think when we're talking
about science and religion,

00:40:16.350 --> 00:40:23.730 align:middle line:84%
it's important to remember that
for people who are strictly

00:40:23.730 --> 00:40:29.650 align:middle line:84%
religious, evidence
from their sacred text

00:40:29.650 --> 00:40:33.100 align:middle line:90%
is authoritative for them.

00:40:33.100 --> 00:40:38.610 align:middle line:84%
So in the world of science, a
statement from a sacred text,

00:40:38.610 --> 00:40:43.060 align:middle line:84%
be it the Bible or the
Koran or a Vedic text,

00:40:43.060 --> 00:40:48.240 align:middle line:84%
is not going to be
taken as authoritative.

00:40:48.240 --> 00:40:52.400 align:middle line:90%
But here's what I propose doing.

00:40:52.400 --> 00:40:57.440 align:middle line:84%
You can take an idea
from a sacred text

00:40:57.440 --> 00:41:05.370 align:middle line:84%
and turn it into a hypothesis
and make a prediction from it,

00:41:05.370 --> 00:41:07.880 align:middle line:84%
and then look and
see whether there

00:41:07.880 --> 00:41:12.990 align:middle line:84%
is any evidence from the
scientific point of view

00:41:12.990 --> 00:41:18.360 align:middle line:84%
that confirms or
denies your hypothesis.

00:41:18.360 --> 00:41:23.150 align:middle line:84%
For example, in my
"Forbidden Archaeology" work,

00:41:23.150 --> 00:41:25.530 align:middle line:90%
here's what I did.

00:41:25.530 --> 00:41:31.030 align:middle line:84%
In the Puranas, the historical
texts of ancient India,

00:41:31.030 --> 00:41:36.920 align:middle line:84%
there are statements about
extreme human antiquity,

00:41:36.920 --> 00:41:40.370 align:middle line:84%
humans existing
millions of years ago.

00:41:40.370 --> 00:41:45.140 align:middle line:84%
So in terms of my
dealings with science,

00:41:45.140 --> 00:41:49.250 align:middle line:84%
I could not go to a meeting
of the World Archaeological

00:41:49.250 --> 00:41:53.394 align:middle line:84%
Congress and just present a
statement from the Puranas.

00:41:53.394 --> 00:41:54.060 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:41:54.060 --> 00:41:57.640 align:middle line:84%
>>CREMO: Now if I was in India
in the Himalayan mountains just

00:41:57.640 --> 00:42:01.240 align:middle line:84%
speaking with a
bunch of Vedic sages

00:42:01.240 --> 00:42:04.910 align:middle line:84%
who accept the statements
of the Puranas as evidence,

00:42:04.910 --> 00:42:06.590 align:middle line:90%
I could do that.

00:42:06.590 --> 00:42:09.690 align:middle line:84%
But if I go to a meeting
of archaeologists

00:42:09.690 --> 00:42:13.660 align:middle line:84%
in the Western world, they're
not going to accept that.

00:42:13.660 --> 00:42:21.180 align:middle line:84%
So what I do is I put it
in terms of a hypothesis.

00:42:21.180 --> 00:42:25.950 align:middle line:84%
If the statements of
the Puranas are true,

00:42:25.950 --> 00:42:34.680 align:middle line:84%
then there should be reports of
archaeological evidence showing

00:42:34.680 --> 00:42:39.200 align:middle line:84%
that humans existed
millions of years ago.

00:42:39.200 --> 00:42:43.630 align:middle line:84%
So that's a prediction
that can be tested.

00:42:43.630 --> 00:42:47.090 align:middle line:84%
And I explain my
methodology; well,

00:42:47.090 --> 00:42:50.340 align:middle line:84%
let me look at all
the scientific reports

00:42:50.340 --> 00:42:52.900 align:middle line:84%
and see if there
are any that are

00:42:52.900 --> 00:42:56.160 align:middle line:84%
consistent with what
the Puranas say.

00:42:56.160 --> 00:43:00.020 align:middle line:84%
Now if there are none,
then I don't have anything

00:43:00.020 --> 00:43:03.420 align:middle line:90%
to say in scientific circles.

00:43:03.420 --> 00:43:07.810 align:middle line:84%
If there are such reports,
and I found there were,

00:43:07.810 --> 00:43:11.804 align:middle line:84%
there were many, enough to
fill up a 900 page book,

00:43:11.804 --> 00:43:17.680 align:middle line:84%
then I do have something to
say in scientific circles.

00:43:17.680 --> 00:43:22.300 align:middle line:84%
And in this latest book of
mine, "My Science, My Religion,"

00:43:22.300 --> 00:43:28.342 align:middle line:84%
I have 24 papers
that I presented--

00:43:28.342 --> 00:43:28.925 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:43:28.925 --> 00:43:34.100 align:middle line:84%
>>CREMO: -at major international
scientific conferences.

00:43:34.100 --> 00:43:35.340 align:middle line:90%
So--

00:43:35.340 --> 00:43:37.770 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: You were
presenting to your peers.

00:43:37.770 --> 00:43:42.040 align:middle line:84%
OK, and you were mentioning a
bit ago that the Puranas talk

00:43:42.040 --> 00:43:44.710 align:middle line:84%
about the ancient
antiquity of our species,

00:43:44.710 --> 00:43:47.830 align:middle line:84%
but also, as I recall
in reading through here,

00:43:47.830 --> 00:43:52.820 align:middle line:84%
the existence of monkey-like
or ape-like beings

00:43:52.820 --> 00:43:58.140 align:middle line:84%
who existed also into extreme
antiquity alongside humans.

00:43:58.140 --> 00:44:00.300 align:middle line:90%
They existed simultaneously.

00:44:00.300 --> 00:44:01.764 align:middle line:90%
>>CREMO: Yes.

00:44:01.764 --> 00:44:06.650 align:middle line:84%
The Puranas and other historical
writings of ancient India

00:44:06.650 --> 00:44:10.480 align:middle line:84%
speak of creatures
called Vanaras.

00:44:10.480 --> 00:44:12.970 align:middle line:90%
That means forest dwellers.

00:44:12.970 --> 00:44:16.280 align:middle line:84%
And if you look at the
descriptions of them,

00:44:16.280 --> 00:44:20.580 align:middle line:84%
you'll see they
have ape-like bodies

00:44:20.580 --> 00:44:24.260 align:middle line:90%
but human-like intelligence.

00:44:24.260 --> 00:44:27.630 align:middle line:90%
They have the ability to speak.

00:44:27.630 --> 00:44:31.640 align:middle line:84%
They have a simple
level of culture

00:44:31.640 --> 00:44:35.620 align:middle line:84%
and-- now this takes
us into another area,

00:44:35.620 --> 00:44:38.640 align:middle line:90%
they also have mystic powers.

00:44:38.640 --> 00:44:39.390 align:middle line:90%
Now--

00:44:39.390 --> 00:44:42.180 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Graham Hancock
writes about this a bit

00:44:42.180 --> 00:44:44.760 align:middle line:84%
in his work of
fiction, "Entangled."

00:44:44.760 --> 00:44:46.340 align:middle line:90%
He speaks about this.

00:44:46.340 --> 00:44:47.920 align:middle line:90%
>>CREMO: Yeah.

00:44:47.920 --> 00:44:50.260 align:middle line:90%
I know Graham.

00:44:50.260 --> 00:44:54.805 align:middle line:84%
He's another figure in the
alternative history field.

00:44:54.805 --> 00:44:55.690 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:44:55.690 --> 00:44:56.510 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

00:44:56.510 --> 00:44:58.020 align:middle line:84%
Well, and then
also, you're looking

00:44:58.020 --> 00:45:00.890 align:middle line:84%
at-- now you're looking
at coming into modern lore

00:45:00.890 --> 00:45:02.950 align:middle line:84%
with this even
taking it forward,

00:45:02.950 --> 00:45:05.800 align:middle line:84%
creatures such as
Bigfoot or Sasquatch

00:45:05.800 --> 00:45:09.660 align:middle line:84%
that have managed to
somehow throughout eons

00:45:09.660 --> 00:45:12.620 align:middle line:84%
remain isolated enough
to survive, right?

00:45:12.620 --> 00:45:14.040 align:middle line:90%
This is part of it?

00:45:14.040 --> 00:45:14.872 align:middle line:90%
>>CREMO: Yes.

00:45:14.872 --> 00:45:20.710 align:middle line:84%
I think just as today
we are coexisting

00:45:20.710 --> 00:45:26.380 align:middle line:84%
with apes and monkeys, and
with various kinds of ape men

00:45:26.380 --> 00:45:33.360 align:middle line:84%
on this planet; in the past,
we also coexisted with them.

00:45:33.360 --> 00:45:38.120 align:middle line:84%
So the picture that you get if
you look at all the evidence

00:45:38.120 --> 00:45:44.110 align:middle line:84%
is not one of evolution of
one form from the other,

00:45:44.110 --> 00:45:48.230 align:middle line:84%
but one of coexistence
of different types

00:45:48.230 --> 00:45:53.620 align:middle line:84%
of human and ape-like
and ape beings.

00:45:53.620 --> 00:45:57.870 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And in pop literature,
this was captured by the series

00:45:57.870 --> 00:46:00.500 align:middle line:90%
"Clan of the Cave Bears."

00:46:00.500 --> 00:46:05.530 align:middle line:84%
That was an attempt to
put modern anatomically--

00:46:05.530 --> 00:46:08.260 align:middle line:84%
Daryl Hannah played the
part in the film years ago,

00:46:08.260 --> 00:46:12.010 align:middle line:84%
modern humans alongside
cave dwellers of the day.

00:46:12.010 --> 00:46:16.050 align:middle line:84%
So maybe she was tapping into
something on an intuitive level

00:46:16.050 --> 00:46:18.160 align:middle line:90%
in writing this series of books.

00:46:18.160 --> 00:46:18.800 align:middle line:90%
>>CREMO: Yes.

00:46:18.800 --> 00:46:25.440 align:middle line:84%
And I think science
is step-by-step slowly

00:46:25.440 --> 00:46:29.030 align:middle line:84%
coming around to
that point of view.

00:46:29.030 --> 00:46:36.570 align:middle line:84%
When I published "Forbidden
Archeology" in 1993,

00:46:36.570 --> 00:46:41.720 align:middle line:84%
most scientists did
not believe that humans

00:46:41.720 --> 00:46:46.480 align:middle line:84%
like us coexisted
with ancestral types,

00:46:46.480 --> 00:46:48.850 align:middle line:84%
according to their
point of view.

00:46:48.850 --> 00:46:52.800 align:middle line:84%
But today, most
archaeologists do

00:46:52.800 --> 00:46:57.500 align:middle line:84%
believe that at a
certain point in time,

00:46:57.500 --> 00:47:04.720 align:middle line:84%
that humans like us coexisted
with other ape-like human-like

00:47:04.720 --> 00:47:05.860 align:middle line:90%
beings.

00:47:05.860 --> 00:47:07.936 align:middle line:90%
So they're kind of coming--

00:47:07.936 --> 00:47:08.560 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:47:08.560 --> 00:47:11.560 align:middle line:84%
And this would indicate too
there is no missing link.

00:47:11.560 --> 00:47:13.470 align:middle line:84%
We talked about this
early in the interview.

00:47:13.470 --> 00:47:14.630 align:middle line:90%
There is no missing link.

00:47:14.630 --> 00:47:17.610 align:middle line:84%
But when I talked to you last,
which was a few years ago,

00:47:17.610 --> 00:47:20.770 align:middle line:84%
I think it was before
this book came out,

00:47:20.770 --> 00:47:23.300 align:middle line:84%
we discussed that
there is a larger

00:47:23.300 --> 00:47:27.000 align:middle line:84%
agenda to Darwin's
Theory of Evolution.

00:47:27.000 --> 00:47:30.236 align:middle line:84%
And I was very interested in
what you had to say about that

00:47:30.236 --> 00:47:31.860 align:middle line:84%
and have shared that
with other people.

00:47:31.860 --> 00:47:35.800 align:middle line:84%
And I would like to hear that
again, if you wouldn't mind,

00:47:35.800 --> 00:47:38.150 align:middle line:84%
we can wrap this interview
up with that understanding

00:47:38.150 --> 00:47:40.570 align:middle line:90%
from your perspective.

00:47:40.570 --> 00:47:43.650 align:middle line:84%
>>CREMO: Well, these
questions, who am I

00:47:43.650 --> 00:47:49.280 align:middle line:84%
and where did I come
from, are very important.

00:47:49.280 --> 00:47:57.320 align:middle line:84%
We form our goals and our
values based on our answers

00:47:57.320 --> 00:47:59.820 align:middle line:90%
to these fundamental questions.

00:47:59.820 --> 00:48:03.160 align:middle line:84%
For example, if I think
I'm an American man,

00:48:03.160 --> 00:48:07.390 align:middle line:84%
then that's how I behave because
that's my sense of identity.

00:48:07.390 --> 00:48:10.780 align:middle line:84%
And from that sense
of identity flow

00:48:10.780 --> 00:48:16.030 align:middle line:84%
my values and my goals
and my ambitions.

00:48:16.030 --> 00:48:24.120 align:middle line:84%
So for the past century
or so, the supporters

00:48:24.120 --> 00:48:27.000 align:middle line:84%
of the Darwinian
Theory of Evolution,

00:48:27.000 --> 00:48:31.010 align:middle line:84%
through the monopoly they
have in the education

00:48:31.010 --> 00:48:34.000 align:middle line:84%
systems in most
countries in the world,

00:48:34.000 --> 00:48:38.810 align:middle line:84%
have had the power
to dictate to people

00:48:38.810 --> 00:48:45.100 align:middle line:84%
the answers to those
fundamental questions who am I

00:48:45.100 --> 00:48:47.560 align:middle line:90%
and where did I come from?

00:48:47.560 --> 00:48:51.270 align:middle line:84%
And the answers
that they are giving

00:48:51.270 --> 00:48:55.520 align:middle line:84%
to these fundamental questions
are quite materialistic.

00:48:55.520 --> 00:49:01.200 align:middle line:84%
They're basically saying,
well, we're just evolved apes.

00:49:01.200 --> 00:49:05.420 align:middle line:84%
We are machines made of
matter in competition

00:49:05.420 --> 00:49:09.750 align:middle line:90%
with each other for survival.

00:49:09.750 --> 00:49:14.640 align:middle line:84%
And as far as any other
ideas are concerned,

00:49:14.640 --> 00:49:19.070 align:middle line:84%
they're excluded from
the education system.

00:49:19.070 --> 00:49:22.170 align:middle line:84%
So these are the
dominant ideas that

00:49:22.170 --> 00:49:27.270 align:middle line:84%
are being promoted
all over the world

00:49:27.270 --> 00:49:31.810 align:middle line:84%
by the supporters of the
Darwinian Theory of Evolution.

00:49:31.810 --> 00:49:35.720 align:middle line:84%
Now because the
answers they're giving

00:49:35.720 --> 00:49:37.865 align:middle line:84%
to these fundamental
questions, who am I

00:49:37.865 --> 00:49:42.250 align:middle line:84%
and where did I come from, are
so thoroughly materialistic,

00:49:42.250 --> 00:49:47.280 align:middle line:84%
it's no surprise to me that
our whole worldwide human

00:49:47.280 --> 00:49:51.190 align:middle line:84%
civilization has
become influenced

00:49:51.190 --> 00:49:54.480 align:middle line:90%
in a very materialistic way.

00:49:54.480 --> 00:49:58.860 align:middle line:84%
Most people believe that
to produce and consume

00:49:58.860 --> 00:50:05.330 align:middle line:84%
more and more material things is
the main purpose of human life.

00:50:05.330 --> 00:50:09.190 align:middle line:84%
And this has some
effects on human society.

00:50:09.190 --> 00:50:12.900 align:middle line:84%
One effect that it has
is on the environment.

00:50:12.900 --> 00:50:15.626 align:middle line:84%
Because of this process
of overproduction

00:50:15.626 --> 00:50:19.660 align:middle line:84%
and over-consumption
of material things,

00:50:19.660 --> 00:50:23.470 align:middle line:84%
we're poisoning the
air, poisoning the land,

00:50:23.470 --> 00:50:27.270 align:middle line:84%
poisoning the water, consuming
the Earth's resources

00:50:27.270 --> 00:50:32.270 align:middle line:84%
in an unsustainable way,
driving all kinds of species

00:50:32.270 --> 00:50:35.890 align:middle line:84%
of plants and animals
into extinction.

00:50:35.890 --> 00:50:39.380 align:middle line:90%
So that is one effect.

00:50:39.380 --> 00:50:46.400 align:middle line:84%
Another effect of these
ideas is we see conflict

00:50:46.400 --> 00:50:48.900 align:middle line:90%
on all levels of human society.

00:50:48.900 --> 00:50:54.690 align:middle line:84%
If we're told we're machines
made of matter in competition

00:50:54.690 --> 00:50:57.270 align:middle line:84%
with each other for
survival, then we

00:50:57.270 --> 00:51:03.670 align:middle line:84%
divide ourselves into competing
groups of nations, classes,

00:51:03.670 --> 00:51:06.680 align:middle line:90%
religions, whatever.

00:51:06.680 --> 00:51:13.940 align:middle line:84%
And we compete with each other
for the control of material

00:51:13.940 --> 00:51:17.396 align:middle line:84%
resources in one
fashion or another.

00:51:17.396 --> 00:51:17.895 align:middle line:90%
So--

00:51:17.895 --> 00:51:19.770 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: But then you
go to church on Sunday

00:51:19.770 --> 00:51:22.990 align:middle line:84%
and you're told
that that is bad.

00:51:22.990 --> 00:51:24.700 align:middle line:84%
I mean, look at the
conflicting messages

00:51:24.700 --> 00:51:29.000 align:middle line:84%
that you should be, in the
Judeo Christian way, selfless.

00:51:29.000 --> 00:51:31.460 align:middle line:84%
I mean, really,
it's quite a schism.

00:51:31.460 --> 00:51:33.580 align:middle line:90%
>>CREMO: Well, it depends.

00:51:33.580 --> 00:51:40.390 align:middle line:84%
You know, the one
thing that I believe

00:51:40.390 --> 00:51:47.880 align:middle line:84%
comes from this Darwinian
idea of competing

00:51:47.880 --> 00:51:51.990 align:middle line:84%
with each other for
survival is the division

00:51:51.990 --> 00:51:55.790 align:middle line:84%
into religious groups competing
with each other for survival.

00:51:55.790 --> 00:51:58.400 align:middle line:84%
Now, I know that's
not the only cause,

00:51:58.400 --> 00:52:01.667 align:middle line:84%
but I think this is
something that contributes--

00:52:01.667 --> 00:52:02.250 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:52:02.250 --> 00:52:02.860 align:middle line:90%
>>CREMO: -to this.

00:52:02.860 --> 00:52:03.830 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So it's
still fundamental,

00:52:03.830 --> 00:52:06.180 align:middle line:84%
even to the way those
religions operate and function.

00:52:06.180 --> 00:52:11.840 align:middle line:84%
>>CREMO: Well, we see that
in the previous century,

00:52:11.840 --> 00:52:15.560 align:middle line:84%
the 20th century, the big
conflicts in the world

00:52:15.560 --> 00:52:20.240 align:middle line:84%
were driven by competing
ideological systems

00:52:20.240 --> 00:52:24.810 align:middle line:84%
like communism and
capitalism and fascism.

00:52:24.810 --> 00:52:30.810 align:middle line:84%
In the 21st century,
it appears that one

00:52:30.810 --> 00:52:35.620 align:middle line:84%
of the elements of
conflict is competing

00:52:35.620 --> 00:52:39.370 align:middle line:90%
religious views of the world.

00:52:39.370 --> 00:52:45.770 align:middle line:84%
And I think there is a
higher religious vision that

00:52:45.770 --> 00:52:51.630 align:middle line:84%
recognizes the unity
of all living things

00:52:51.630 --> 00:52:56.880 align:middle line:84%
and does not support
this division of humans

00:52:56.880 --> 00:52:58.047 align:middle line:90%
into competing--

00:52:58.047 --> 00:52:58.630 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:52:58.630 --> 00:53:01.720 align:middle line:84%
>>CREMO: -groups even on
the basis of religion.

00:53:01.720 --> 00:53:07.460 align:middle line:84%
And I think there is a
higher type of religion

00:53:07.460 --> 00:53:10.690 align:middle line:84%
that stresses
non-material values.

00:53:10.690 --> 00:53:19.140 align:middle line:84%
Now, in many cases, religion is
promoting materialistic values,

00:53:19.140 --> 00:53:20.540 align:middle line:90%
as I mentioned.

00:53:20.540 --> 00:53:26.660 align:middle line:84%
Say if you define in
scientific terms or identity

00:53:26.660 --> 00:53:28.640 align:middle line:84%
in purely materialistic
terms, you'll

00:53:28.640 --> 00:53:32.650 align:middle line:84%
think that to produce and
consume more and more material

00:53:32.650 --> 00:53:35.840 align:middle line:84%
things is the main
purpose of human life.

00:53:35.840 --> 00:53:41.220 align:middle line:84%
Well, for some people,
religion means praying to God,

00:53:41.220 --> 00:53:43.710 align:middle line:84%
please help me produce and
consume more and more--

00:53:43.710 --> 00:53:44.626 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: That's true.

00:53:44.626 --> 00:53:45.680 align:middle line:90%
That is true.

00:53:45.680 --> 00:53:46.722 align:middle line:90%
>>CREMO: -materal things.

00:53:46.722 --> 00:53:47.388 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:53:47.388 --> 00:53:49.540 align:middle line:84%
>>CREMO: So I think
there's a higher religion,

00:53:49.540 --> 00:53:56.260 align:middle line:84%
a true spirituality that kind
of goes beyond all of that.

00:53:56.260 --> 00:54:02.660 align:middle line:84%
And I would say part of the
power of the Darwinian Theory

00:54:02.660 --> 00:54:08.970 align:middle line:84%
of Evolution is the compromises
that many of the world's

00:54:08.970 --> 00:54:11.700 align:middle line:90%
religions have made with it.

00:54:11.700 --> 00:54:14.300 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: That's an
interesting story in itself.

00:54:14.300 --> 00:54:18.920 align:middle line:84%
>>CREMO: Which gives it a
certain amount of social power

00:54:18.920 --> 00:54:22.560 align:middle line:84%
that I think eventually
needs to be broken.

00:54:22.560 --> 00:54:23.420 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:54:23.420 --> 00:54:27.840 align:middle line:84%
And it seems that another effect
of believing that we descend

00:54:27.840 --> 00:54:31.590 align:middle line:84%
in a materialistic
view from an ape,

00:54:31.590 --> 00:54:33.550 align:middle line:84%
and lower life
forms before that,

00:54:33.550 --> 00:54:37.030 align:middle line:84%
is it also keeps us from
looking at the dual nature

00:54:37.030 --> 00:54:39.830 align:middle line:84%
of our being and
our true potential.

00:54:39.830 --> 00:54:43.430 align:middle line:84%
I mean, we have this vast field
of interconnected intelligence.

00:54:43.430 --> 00:54:45.680 align:middle line:84%
If you believe that
you're essentially

00:54:45.680 --> 00:54:49.430 align:middle line:84%
an ape, dust to
dust-- an evolved--

00:54:49.430 --> 00:54:51.290 align:middle line:84%
an evolution from an
ape, dust-to-dust,

00:54:51.290 --> 00:54:53.280 align:middle line:84%
why would you even
begin that search

00:54:53.280 --> 00:54:55.810 align:middle line:84%
for this more refined
aspect of being

00:54:55.810 --> 00:54:57.660 align:middle line:90%
that survives the physical?

00:54:57.660 --> 00:54:59.630 align:middle line:90%
You wouldn't, right?

00:54:59.630 --> 00:55:02.540 align:middle line:84%
>>CREMO: Yes, but--
yeah, you could

00:55:02.540 --> 00:55:08.380 align:middle line:84%
have a conception of apes
that involved understanding

00:55:08.380 --> 00:55:12.909 align:middle line:84%
that they also have a
non-material conscious self.

00:55:12.909 --> 00:55:14.950 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: That's true and
it goes a step further.

00:55:14.950 --> 00:55:19.460 align:middle line:84%
>>CREMO: And that through
the process of reincarnation

00:55:19.460 --> 00:55:21.800 align:middle line:84%
the soul that's now
in the body of an ape

00:55:21.800 --> 00:55:25.880 align:middle line:84%
could eventually come
to that of a human form.

00:55:25.880 --> 00:55:30.120 align:middle line:84%
So I think the
real problem is not

00:55:30.120 --> 00:55:38.680 align:middle line:84%
understanding that life
is more than a combination

00:55:38.680 --> 00:55:41.140 align:middle line:84%
of molecules, of
material elements.

00:55:41.140 --> 00:55:44.630 align:middle line:84%
Whether we're talking about
plants, animals, apes,

00:55:44.630 --> 00:55:49.020 align:middle line:84%
ape men, or human
beings, a living thing

00:55:49.020 --> 00:55:52.600 align:middle line:84%
is more than a
combination of chemicals.

00:55:52.600 --> 00:55:57.190 align:middle line:84%
We're not just machines
made of matter.

00:55:57.190 --> 00:56:00.250 align:middle line:84%
We have a subtle
mind element that

00:56:00.250 --> 00:56:03.400 align:middle line:90%
has some very unusual powers.

00:56:03.400 --> 00:56:09.310 align:middle line:84%
There is a conscious self
that is totally non-material.

00:56:09.310 --> 00:56:17.110 align:middle line:84%
I look at bodies as vehicles
for conscious selves.

00:56:17.110 --> 00:56:18.947 align:middle line:90%
That's what we really are.

00:56:18.947 --> 00:56:19.530 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:56:19.530 --> 00:56:23.920 align:middle line:84%
>>CREMO: And this is something
that I explored in depth

00:56:23.920 --> 00:56:27.910 align:middle line:90%
in my book "Human Devolution--"

00:56:27.910 --> 00:56:28.990 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:56:28.990 --> 00:56:34.460 align:middle line:84%
>>CREMO: -where I propose,
well, as conscious beings,

00:56:34.460 --> 00:56:39.640 align:middle line:84%
we did not evolve
up from matter.

00:56:39.640 --> 00:56:43.320 align:middle line:84%
Rather we have
devolved, or come down,

00:56:43.320 --> 00:56:46.770 align:middle line:84%
from the level of
pure consciousness.

00:56:46.770 --> 00:56:50.960 align:middle line:84%
Matter does not
produce consciousness,

00:56:50.960 --> 00:56:56.500 align:middle line:84%
but consciousness can become
associated with matter.

00:56:56.500 --> 00:57:00.910 align:middle line:84%
And we're now in that condition,
where our consciousness has

00:57:00.910 --> 00:57:05.210 align:middle line:90%
become associated with matter.

00:57:05.210 --> 00:57:13.090 align:middle line:84%
And, to me, this indicates that
the real purpose of human life

00:57:13.090 --> 00:57:19.110 align:middle line:84%
is to restore consciousness
to its original pure state.

00:57:19.110 --> 00:57:24.290 align:middle line:84%
Which means we should try
to satisfy our material

00:57:24.290 --> 00:57:29.660 align:middle line:84%
needs in the most simple,
natural, and efficient way

00:57:29.660 --> 00:57:33.870 align:middle line:84%
possible while putting
most of our human energy

00:57:33.870 --> 00:57:39.120 align:middle line:84%
into developing that
resource of consciousness.

00:57:39.120 --> 00:57:40.239 align:middle line:90%
And I think this is--

00:57:40.239 --> 00:57:41.530 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: I think you're right.

00:57:41.530 --> 00:57:44.490 align:middle line:84%
>>CREMO: -something we've gotten
away from in our current--

00:57:44.490 --> 00:57:45.950 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: That's the only thing
that's going to put balance--

00:57:45.950 --> 00:57:46.370 align:middle line:90%
>>CREMO: -situation.

00:57:46.370 --> 00:57:48.200 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: -back into all
of it because how can you

00:57:48.200 --> 00:57:49.960 align:middle line:84%
respect other life
forms and the Earth

00:57:49.960 --> 00:57:53.627 align:middle line:84%
itself if you don't have
the consciousness to do so?

00:57:53.627 --> 00:57:55.460 align:middle line:84%
And expanded awareness,
especially if you're

00:57:55.460 --> 00:57:57.880 align:middle line:84%
into a material
paradigm of consumption

00:57:57.880 --> 00:58:01.410 align:middle line:84%
so that the machine can
keep perpetuating itself.

00:58:01.410 --> 00:58:03.950 align:middle line:84%
>>CREMO: I think
if I understand I'm

00:58:03.950 --> 00:58:08.180 align:middle line:84%
a being of pure consciousness,
all others are beings

00:58:08.180 --> 00:58:10.480 align:middle line:84%
of pure consciousness,
that we develop

00:58:10.480 --> 00:58:13.820 align:middle line:90%
a real respect for life.

00:58:13.820 --> 00:58:19.750 align:middle line:84%
We don't divide ourselves
into competing groups

00:58:19.750 --> 00:58:26.560 align:middle line:84%
and cause so much conflict
and destruction in the world.

00:58:26.560 --> 00:58:27.860 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Absolutely.

00:58:27.860 --> 00:58:31.030 align:middle line:84%
I have just one quick question,
and this is now a total non

00:58:31.030 --> 00:58:35.010 align:middle line:84%
sequitur and it's a
question, why Vishnu here

00:58:35.010 --> 00:58:36.290 align:middle line:90%
is depicted as blue.

00:58:36.290 --> 00:58:38.420 align:middle line:84%
Sometimes Krishna
is depicted as blue.

00:58:38.420 --> 00:58:41.060 align:middle line:90%
Why are they depicted as blue?

00:58:41.060 --> 00:58:43.600 align:middle line:84%
>>CREMO: That is an
image of Mahavishnu.

00:58:43.600 --> 00:58:49.080 align:middle line:84%
And according to the
ancient Sanskrit texts,

00:58:49.080 --> 00:58:55.280 align:middle line:90%
that color blue is his color.

00:58:55.280 --> 00:58:57.470 align:middle line:90%
It represents pure intelligence.

00:58:57.470 --> 00:58:58.330 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: OK.

00:58:58.330 --> 00:59:01.180 align:middle line:84%
I knew it was
symbolic, but I never

00:59:01.180 --> 00:59:02.960 align:middle line:84%
asked anybody that
had that answer.

00:59:02.960 --> 00:59:04.640 align:middle line:90%
So thank you for sharing that.

00:59:04.640 --> 00:59:06.080 align:middle line:84%
And we have much
more to discuss.

00:59:06.080 --> 00:59:09.070 align:middle line:84%
So Michael and I are going
to continue this conversation

00:59:09.070 --> 00:59:11.410 align:middle line:84%
by discussing the evidence
that has been unearthed

00:59:11.410 --> 00:59:13.670 align:middle line:84%
that lines up with
the Purana texts.

00:59:13.670 --> 00:59:16.020 align:middle line:84%
These show that Homo sapiens
are hundreds of millions

00:59:16.020 --> 00:59:16.840 align:middle line:90%
of years old.

00:59:16.840 --> 00:59:19.980 align:middle line:84%
Also that we've been all but
wiped out on repeated occasions

00:59:19.980 --> 00:59:21.090 align:middle line:90%
throughout history.

00:59:21.090 --> 00:59:23.220 align:middle line:84%
You won't want to miss
the rest of the story.

00:59:23.220 --> 00:59:27.480 align:middle line:84%
Until next time, thank you for
joining us here on Gaiam TV.
