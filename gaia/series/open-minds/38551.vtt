[Silence ] [Music ]
>> Regina Meredith:

00:00:27.382 --> 00:00:30.959 align:middle line:84%
It's been a few months since we
spoke with Andy Hoffman last,

00:00:30.959 --> 00:00:33.234 align:middle line:84%
and much has changed
within the economy.

00:00:33.234 --> 00:00:35.723 align:middle line:84%
For one, we had a federal
government shutdown which

00:00:35.723 --> 00:00:37.271 align:middle line:90%
we're still reverberating from.

00:00:37.271 --> 00:00:39.240 align:middle line:90%
Next, we have Obamacare.

00:00:39.240 --> 00:00:42.309 align:middle line:84%
No one knows the toll this is
going to take on our economy.

00:00:42.309 --> 00:00:44.017 align:middle line:84%
In addition, rumors
have been heightening

00:00:44.017 --> 00:00:45.954 align:middle line:84%
for months about
global currency resets

00:00:45.954 --> 00:00:49.950 align:middle line:84%
with people putting their lives
on hold waiting for windfalls.

00:00:49.950 --> 00:00:52.697 align:middle line:84%
Andy is here to help us
sort through the whole mess

00:00:52.697 --> 00:00:53.581 align:middle line:90%
and it is a mess.

00:00:53.581 --> 00:00:54.622 align:middle line:90%
>> Andrew Hoffman: It is.

00:00:54.622 --> 00:00:55.389 align:middle line:90%
>> Regina: Indeed.

00:00:55.389 --> 00:00:57.293 align:middle line:84%
OK, let's see, I have
a couple-- I have

00:00:57.293 --> 00:00:58.459 align:middle line:90%
some questions written down.

00:00:58.459 --> 00:01:01.195 align:middle line:84%
We can go where we want with it,
but we have to start somewhere.

00:01:01.195 --> 00:01:03.663 align:middle line:84%
First of all, let's talk
about the government shutdown.

00:01:03.663 --> 00:01:05.232 align:middle line:90%
What happened?

00:01:05.232 --> 00:01:07.201 align:middle line:90%
What's still happening?

00:01:07.201 --> 00:01:09.970 align:middle line:84%
What's likely to
be happening again?

00:01:09.970 --> 00:01:12.540 align:middle line:84%
>> Hoffman: OK, well obviously
what's going on is just a lot

00:01:12.540 --> 00:01:14.008 align:middle line:90%
of political posturing.

00:01:14.008 --> 00:01:17.144 align:middle line:84%
We did have a government
shutdown per se,

00:01:17.144 --> 00:01:20.881 align:middle line:90%
because they didn't fund it.

00:01:20.881 --> 00:01:23.570 align:middle line:84%
They need it to pay the bills
so they have to create a new

00:01:23.570 --> 00:01:26.153 align:middle line:84%
budget which they still haven't
done,so they've kicked the can

00:01:26.153 --> 00:01:29.389 align:middle line:84%
down the road into January
which we'll talk about again.

00:01:29.389 --> 00:01:31.789 align:middle line:84%
People believe that
the government actually

00:01:31.789 --> 00:01:34.825 align:middle line:84%
was shutdown when in fact
90 percent of the government

00:01:34.825 --> 00:01:36.995 align:middle line:84%
was still up and running,
that's why you still

00:01:36.995 --> 00:01:40.083 align:middle line:84%
got your mail and all these
other things which have now

00:01:40.083 --> 00:01:41.302 align:middle line:90%
been considered essential.

00:01:41.302 --> 00:01:44.480 align:middle line:84%
And on top of that, all the
people who were furlowed

00:01:44.480 --> 00:01:47.035 align:middle line:84%
got unemployment
insurance, some of them

00:01:47.035 --> 00:01:49.410 align:middle line:84%
got unemployment insurance
and now they all got back pay.

00:01:49.410 --> 00:01:50.578 align:middle line:84%
>> Regina: Back pay,
I know I heard that.

00:01:50.578 --> 00:01:52.304 align:middle line:84%
>> Hoffman: So, they got
basically a two and a half week

00:01:52.304 --> 00:01:52.478 align:middle line:90%
vacation.

00:01:52.478 --> 00:01:53.314 align:middle line:84%
>> Regina: Talking
about windfalls.

00:01:53.314 --> 00:01:54.381 align:middle line:90%
>> Hoffman: Yeah.

00:01:54.381 --> 00:01:56.941 align:middle line:84%
A two and a half week vacation
that we paid for and they got

00:01:56.941 --> 00:01:58.085 align:middle line:90%
paid overtime for it.

00:01:58.085 --> 00:02:00.454 align:middle line:84%
>> Regina: And, yeah, where
did this money appear from?

00:02:00.454 --> 00:02:04.358 align:middle line:84%
>> Hoffman: Well, they made a
deal at the last second just

00:02:04.358 --> 00:02:07.795 align:middle line:84%
like the fiscal cliff deal last
year to kick the can again.

00:02:07.795 --> 00:02:10.197 align:middle line:84%
They didn't really
budget anything.

00:02:10.197 --> 00:02:12.633 align:middle line:84%
They said, "OK,
by December 13th,

00:02:12.633 --> 00:02:15.362 align:middle line:84%
we will have a long
term spending plan."

00:02:15.362 --> 00:02:16.570 align:middle line:90%
They didn't call it a budget.

00:02:16.570 --> 00:02:19.039 align:middle line:84%
Remember, we haven't had
a budget for five years.

00:02:19.039 --> 00:02:21.793 align:middle line:84%
December 13th is now only
four, five weeks away,

00:02:21.793 --> 00:02:23.676 align:middle line:90%
haven't heard a peep about it.

00:02:23.676 --> 00:02:25.092 align:middle line:84%
And if they don't
have that, we're

00:02:25.092 --> 00:02:26.926 align:middle line:84%
going to go through
the same process

00:02:26.926 --> 00:02:28.849 align:middle line:84%
early next year
because this deal

00:02:28.849 --> 00:02:32.120 align:middle line:84%
that they made only funded
the government through January

00:02:32.120 --> 00:02:32.620 align:middle line:90%
15th.

00:02:32.620 --> 00:02:36.423 align:middle line:84%
So, it looks like just like
the fiscal cliff deal last year

00:02:36.423 --> 00:02:38.631 align:middle line:84%
and this deal a few
weeks ago, we're

00:02:38.631 --> 00:02:40.961 align:middle line:84%
going to go through
the same thing again.

00:02:40.961 --> 00:02:43.533 align:middle line:84%
>> Regina: So, if you're
saying that what percentage

00:02:43.533 --> 00:02:46.033 align:middle line:84%
of the government of services
were actually still available?

00:02:46.033 --> 00:02:48.135 align:middle line:84%
I mean that-- >> Hoffman:
Just about everything.

00:02:48.135 --> 00:02:50.404 align:middle line:84%
In fact, the only things
that really close were parks.

00:02:50.404 --> 00:02:53.518 align:middle line:84%
They made a big deal
closing the memorial parks

00:02:53.518 --> 00:02:57.044 align:middle line:84%
as if you need to close a
memorial park-- >> Regina:

00:02:57.044 --> 00:02:57.544 align:middle line:90%
Right.

00:02:57.544 --> 00:02:58.612 align:middle line:84%
>> Hoffman: -- and
anger the veterans.

00:02:58.612 --> 00:03:01.081 align:middle line:84%
They had a million veteran
march to protest it.

00:03:01.081 --> 00:03:03.361 align:middle line:84%
They closed NASA,
you know, things

00:03:03.361 --> 00:03:04.918 align:middle line:90%
that really don't matter much.

00:03:04.918 --> 00:03:06.553 align:middle line:84%
But again, everyone
got paid anyway,

00:03:06.553 --> 00:03:07.955 align:middle line:90%
so it wasn't a real shutdown.

00:03:07.955 --> 00:03:10.679 align:middle line:84%
And the bigger issue
that was going on here

00:03:10.679 --> 00:03:12.388 align:middle line:84%
was this debt ceiling--
>> Regina: Right.

00:03:12.388 --> 00:03:14.262 align:middle line:84%
>> Hoffman: -- which
all was part and parcel.

00:03:14.262 --> 00:03:16.463 align:middle line:84%
Remember the fiscal
year ends September 30th

00:03:16.463 --> 00:03:17.364 align:middle line:90%
for the government.

00:03:17.364 --> 00:03:18.632 align:middle line:84%
So, that's what
this was all about,

00:03:18.632 --> 00:03:20.340 align:middle line:84%
the fiscal year they
didn't have a budget

00:03:20.340 --> 00:03:21.702 align:middle line:90%
because they never have one.

00:03:21.702 --> 00:03:23.854 align:middle line:84%
And also, because of
the deal that they

00:03:23.854 --> 00:03:27.141 align:middle line:84%
made earlier this year to kick
the can with the debt ceiling,

00:03:27.141 --> 00:03:29.443 align:middle line:90%
they pushed it to the same time.

00:03:29.443 --> 00:03:32.246 align:middle line:84%
What they agreed was to
move the debt ceiling again

00:03:32.246 --> 00:03:35.616 align:middle line:84%
to "delay it"
until February 7th.

00:03:35.616 --> 00:03:39.469 align:middle line:84%
So, again we're just growing
debt at a-- unfettered pace

00:03:39.469 --> 00:03:40.320 align:middle line:90%
right now.

00:03:40.320 --> 00:03:43.490 align:middle line:84%
But what people don't realize
about what this deal was,

00:03:43.490 --> 00:03:45.759 align:middle line:84%
remember you had the
Republicans like Boehner,

00:03:45.759 --> 00:03:46.727 align:middle line:90%
that's what I call him.

00:03:46.727 --> 00:03:49.224 align:middle line:84%
[Laughter ] >>
Regina: I like that.

00:03:49.224 --> 00:03:51.265 align:middle line:84%
>> Hoffman: You know,
acting so tough about debt.

00:03:51.265 --> 00:03:52.663 align:middle line:84%
What they inserted
into this deal

00:03:52.663 --> 00:03:57.261 align:middle line:84%
is that any future legislation
that attempts to cap the debt

00:03:57.261 --> 00:04:00.562 align:middle line:84%
can be vetoed by the
President, but better yet

00:04:00.562 --> 00:04:04.007 align:middle line:84%
to override that veto, you
now need a two thirds majority

00:04:04.007 --> 00:04:06.914 align:middle line:84%
in both the House and the
Senate which will never happen.

00:04:06.914 --> 00:04:09.940 align:middle line:84%
So, essentially, we've gotten
rid of the debt ceiling

00:04:09.940 --> 00:04:12.086 align:middle line:84%
permanently and that
will be very clear

00:04:12.086 --> 00:04:14.139 align:middle line:84%
when this whole
process goes through

00:04:14.139 --> 00:04:16.256 align:middle line:90%
in the next month or two.

00:04:16.256 --> 00:04:18.292 align:middle line:84%
>> Regina: I read somewhere
a couple weeks ago.

00:04:18.292 --> 00:04:19.756 align:middle line:84%
It was talking about
the rate that which

00:04:19.756 --> 00:04:21.547 align:middle line:84%
we're racking up debt
and it was something,

00:04:21.547 --> 00:04:23.263 align:middle line:84%
correct me if I'm
wrong, something

00:04:23.263 --> 00:04:26.467 align:middle line:84%
appalling like 56,000
dollars a second

00:04:26.467 --> 00:04:28.188 align:middle line:84%
or a minute,
something like that.

00:04:28.188 --> 00:04:30.771 align:middle line:84%
>> Hoffman: Well, I haven't done
the math in terms of seconds.

00:04:30.771 --> 00:04:31.438 align:middle line:90%
>> Regina: Yeah.

00:04:31.438 --> 00:04:33.937 align:middle line:84%
>> Hoffman: But just last year
alone, it's about a trillion.

00:04:33.937 --> 00:04:34.942 align:middle line:90%
This year I should say.

00:04:34.942 --> 00:04:35.609 align:middle line:90%
>> Regina: Yeah.

00:04:35.609 --> 00:04:37.942 align:middle line:84%
>> Hoffman: And you remember
when Obama came into office

00:04:37.942 --> 00:04:40.581 align:middle line:84%
and this is not about him,
because as a Ponzi scheme,

00:04:40.581 --> 00:04:42.082 align:middle line:90%
it must grow exponentially.

00:04:42.082 --> 00:04:44.702 align:middle line:84%
This started back when
we got up the debt --

00:04:44.702 --> 00:04:46.019 align:middle line:90%
the gold standard in 1971.

00:04:46.019 --> 00:04:51.024 align:middle line:84%
But when Obama came into office,
admittedly during this crisis,

00:04:51.024 --> 00:04:53.327 align:middle line:84%
it was 10 trillion
was the national debt.

00:04:53.327 --> 00:04:55.162 align:middle line:90%
Now, it's over 17 trillion.

00:04:55.162 --> 00:04:58.132 align:middle line:84%
So, we've added over 7
trillion in just five years.

00:04:58.132 --> 00:05:01.086 align:middle line:84%
But not only that,
we also nationalized

00:05:01.086 --> 00:05:03.122 align:middle line:84%
Fannie Mae and Freddie
Mac-- >> Regina: Right.

00:05:03.122 --> 00:05:04.705 align:middle line:84%
>> Hoffman: -- in
the last five years.

00:05:04.705 --> 00:05:06.705 align:middle line:84%
They have 5 trillion
dollars of debt themselves,

00:05:06.705 --> 00:05:08.469 align:middle line:84%
but that is now held
"off balance sheet."

00:05:08.469 --> 00:05:10.844 align:middle line:84%
>> Regina: So, that's not part
of the total debt package?

00:05:10.844 --> 00:05:11.712 align:middle line:84%
>> Hoffman: Yeah,
but it's there.

00:05:11.712 --> 00:05:12.813 align:middle line:90%
>> Regina: Yeah.

00:05:12.813 --> 00:05:14.300 align:middle line:84%
>> Hoffman: And that means we've
added 12 trillion in the last

00:05:14.300 --> 00:05:14.800 align:middle line:90%
five years.

00:05:14.800 --> 00:05:18.064 align:middle line:84%
And then you have what's called
unfunded liabilities which

00:05:18.064 --> 00:05:21.281 align:middle line:84%
means things like the promises
to pensioners, to Medicare,

00:05:21.281 --> 00:05:24.996 align:middle line:84%
to Social Security and the
estimates of those which

00:05:24.996 --> 00:05:27.839 align:middle line:84%
are rising exponentially
are anywhere from--

00:05:27.839 --> 00:05:29.630 align:middle line:84%
I've heard 50 trillion,
a hundred trillion.

00:05:29.630 --> 00:05:32.065 align:middle line:84%
I've even seen a
guy named Kotlikoff,

00:05:32.065 --> 00:05:35.702 align:middle line:84%
he said it's 220 trillion
and rising rapidly.

00:05:35.702 --> 00:05:38.172 align:middle line:84%
So, I mean we've been
broke for a very long time,

00:05:38.172 --> 00:05:40.104 align:middle line:84%
but now we're more
broke than ever.

00:05:40.104 --> 00:05:41.729 align:middle line:84%
And now that we're
actually getting rid

00:05:41.729 --> 00:05:44.275 align:middle line:84%
of the debt ceiling which
is kind of fait accompli,

00:05:44.275 --> 00:05:45.913 align:middle line:90%
it was going to happen anyway.

00:05:45.913 --> 00:05:46.914 align:middle line:90%
>> Regina: Right.

00:05:46.914 --> 00:05:48.713 align:middle line:84%
>> Hoffman: I mean there's a
good chance that that number

00:05:48.713 --> 00:05:49.783 align:middle line:90%
can really go parabolic.

00:05:49.783 --> 00:05:52.953 align:middle line:84%
Remember we have all time
low interest rates right now.

00:05:52.953 --> 00:05:55.144 align:middle line:84%
And as interest
rates creep up just

00:05:55.144 --> 00:05:58.658 align:middle line:84%
by one percent when you
have-- let's say 12 trillion--

00:05:58.658 --> 00:06:02.029 align:middle line:84%
I'm sorry, 20 trillion
debt that adds 200 billion

00:06:02.029 --> 00:06:03.864 align:middle line:84%
of interest payments
for each 1 percent

00:06:03.864 --> 00:06:06.166 align:middle line:90%
that interest rates go up.

00:06:06.166 --> 00:06:08.677 align:middle line:84%
>> Regina: OK, so we're now
within a range of unfathomable

00:06:08.677 --> 00:06:12.525 align:middle line:84%
numbers, you know, we don't
even or we can't get our minds

00:06:12.525 --> 00:06:13.407 align:middle line:90%
around it in general.

00:06:13.407 --> 00:06:14.908 align:middle line:90%
We don't understand.

00:06:14.908 --> 00:06:19.079 align:middle line:84%
I think how it could have been
allowed for us to get here

00:06:19.079 --> 00:06:21.731 align:middle line:84%
to begin with and no one
can really see a way out

00:06:21.731 --> 00:06:22.682 align:middle line:90%
of this point.

00:06:22.682 --> 00:06:25.743 align:middle line:84%
And so, just to put things in
perspective with the numbers

00:06:25.743 --> 00:06:26.887 align:middle line:90%
you just put up.

00:06:26.887 --> 00:06:29.479 align:middle line:84%
What is the gross domestic
product of the U.S.

00:06:29.479 --> 00:06:30.057 align:middle line:90%
for example?

00:06:30.057 --> 00:06:32.326 align:middle line:84%
>> Hoffman: Well, there's a lot
of different numbers out there.

00:06:32.326 --> 00:06:33.527 align:middle line:90%
>> Regina: Yeah, yeah, I know.

00:06:33.527 --> 00:06:34.583 align:middle line:84%
OK, let's say
something that might

00:06:34.583 --> 00:06:35.929 align:middle line:90%
look like a genuine number.

00:06:35.929 --> 00:06:37.164 align:middle line:90%
>> Hoffman: Yeah.

00:06:37.164 --> 00:06:40.567 align:middle line:84%
Well, for the longest time,
it was around 15 trillion.

00:06:40.567 --> 00:06:43.537 align:middle line:84%
So, we're-- you know, that would
make us a 110 percent of GDP

00:06:43.537 --> 00:06:47.507 align:middle line:84%
or maybe a 130 percent if
you include the Fannie Mae,

00:06:47.507 --> 00:06:50.410 align:middle line:84%
Freddie Mac debt or whatever
number you want to pick.

00:06:50.410 --> 00:06:53.672 align:middle line:84%
This summer-- this last
summer, the government secretly

00:06:53.672 --> 00:06:56.443 align:middle line:84%
changed their
calculation of GDP and I

00:06:56.443 --> 00:07:00.741 align:middle line:84%
think they added-- I don't know
20 or 30 percent to the number

00:07:00.741 --> 00:07:04.083 align:middle line:84%
by including intangibles
like goodwill and research

00:07:04.083 --> 00:07:06.663 align:middle line:84%
and lost money, and
research ventures

00:07:06.663 --> 00:07:10.002 align:middle line:84%
just because they want to
publish that the debt to GDP

00:07:10.002 --> 00:07:11.365 align:middle line:90%
number is lower.

00:07:11.365 --> 00:07:14.377 align:middle line:84%
But the fact is that doesn't
mask the fact that the debt is

00:07:14.377 --> 00:07:15.335 align:middle line:90%
still there and rising.

00:07:15.335 --> 00:07:16.895 align:middle line:84%
>> Regina: From
your calculations,

00:07:16.895 --> 00:07:20.774 align:middle line:84%
do you think that that's 15
trillion is fair estimate?

00:07:20.774 --> 00:07:21.909 align:middle line:90%
Is that a realistic number?

00:07:21.909 --> 00:07:24.450 align:middle line:84%
>> Hoffman: It's more realistic
than what they're putting out

00:07:24.450 --> 00:07:24.912 align:middle line:90%
there now.

00:07:24.912 --> 00:07:26.013 align:middle line:84%
>> Regina: What
they're putting-- Yeah.

00:07:26.013 --> 00:07:27.948 align:middle line:84%
>> Hoffman: But again, you know,
the rule of thumb with anything

00:07:27.948 --> 00:07:30.684 align:middle line:84%
the government puts out
regarding, well, anything.

00:07:30.684 --> 00:07:34.868 align:middle line:84%
But particularly economic data
is that it's pure lies and most

00:07:34.868 --> 00:07:37.024 align:middle line:84%
people don't follow
it like I do,

00:07:37.024 --> 00:07:41.140 align:middle line:84%
but everyone can see what's
going on with the unemployment

00:07:41.140 --> 00:07:45.666 align:middle line:84%
rate which is been particularly
galling 'cause it started right

00:07:45.666 --> 00:07:49.256 align:middle line:84%
before last-- the last election
cycle and all of the sudden

00:07:49.256 --> 00:07:51.715 align:middle line:84%
the unemployment rates started
plunging-- >> Regina: Yeah--

00:07:51.715 --> 00:07:53.964 align:middle line:84%
>> Hoffman: -- because of
the labor participation rate

00:07:53.964 --> 00:07:54.841 align:middle line:90%
plunging even faster.

00:07:54.841 --> 00:07:56.176 align:middle line:84%
>> Regina: We're going to
get into that in just a sec.

00:07:56.176 --> 00:07:58.912 align:middle line:84%
I just have another question on
this whole Ponzi scheme thing.

00:07:58.912 --> 00:08:00.013 align:middle line:90%
>> Hoffman: Yes.

00:08:00.013 --> 00:08:02.888 align:middle line:84%
>> Regina: Can you give us a
historical example of a Ponzi

00:08:02.888 --> 00:08:06.320 align:middle line:84%
scheme that actually lasted a
really long time and worked?

00:08:06.320 --> 00:08:08.322 align:middle line:84%
>> Hoffman: No, because
that's the definition.

00:08:08.322 --> 00:08:10.613 align:middle line:84%
>> Regina: Because usually
they go bust-- - >> Hoffman:

00:08:10.613 --> 00:08:13.424 align:middle line:84%
The definition of Ponzi scheme
is any kind of marketing scheme

00:08:13.424 --> 00:08:17.326 align:middle line:84%
or any kind of financial scheme
in which it must grow larger

00:08:17.326 --> 00:08:18.098 align:middle line:90%
to survive.

00:08:18.098 --> 00:08:20.767 align:middle line:84%
And as it grows larger it
must do so exponentially,

00:08:20.767 --> 00:08:23.036 align:middle line:84%
that's why it's a
pyramid-- >> Regina: Right.

00:08:23.036 --> 00:08:27.607 align:middle line:84%
>> Hoffman: -- that gets larger,
balancing on little point.

00:08:27.607 --> 00:08:29.076 align:middle line:90%
So, no, it's impossible.

00:08:29.076 --> 00:08:32.111 align:middle line:84%
It cannot, because any pyramid
scheme eventually collapses

00:08:32.111 --> 00:08:35.514 align:middle line:84%
either due to the size or
a sudden loss in confidence

00:08:35.514 --> 00:08:37.824 align:middle line:84%
and when it comes
to fiat currencies,

00:08:37.824 --> 00:08:41.842 align:middle line:84%
fiat meaning on back, there
have been 599 in the history

00:08:41.842 --> 00:08:43.991 align:middle line:84%
of mankind and not a
single one has survived.

00:08:43.991 --> 00:08:46.183 align:middle line:84%
In fact, the only ones
that didn't collapse

00:08:46.183 --> 00:08:48.518 align:middle line:84%
were because they
were-- the nation was

00:08:48.518 --> 00:08:49.896 align:middle line:90%
conquered by another nation.

00:08:49.896 --> 00:08:52.699 align:middle line:84%
But all the other ones,
including three currencies

00:08:52.699 --> 00:08:57.537 align:middle line:84%
in United States itself, every
single one has collapsed.

00:08:57.537 --> 00:09:01.209 align:middle line:84%
>> Regina: And as you said, we
talked about this in our last

00:09:01.209 --> 00:09:01.708 align:middle line:90%
interview.

00:09:01.708 --> 00:09:05.512 align:middle line:84%
Basically, this is a con game,
a confidence game right now.

00:09:05.512 --> 00:09:06.546 align:middle line:90%
>> Hoffman: Absolutely.

00:09:06.546 --> 00:09:08.882 align:middle line:84%
>> Regina: The entire
economy is a con game.

00:09:08.882 --> 00:09:11.184 align:middle line:84%
>> Hoffman: And as the Ponzi
scheme is getting larger,

00:09:11.184 --> 00:09:14.221 align:middle line:84%
meaning the debt is getting
larger exponentially,

00:09:14.221 --> 00:09:16.857 align:middle line:84%
and as the economy worldwide
is suffering and we're going

00:09:16.857 --> 00:09:19.481 align:middle line:84%
to talk about, I saw
the Fragile Five,

00:09:19.481 --> 00:09:23.836 align:middle line:84%
the economy is suffering from
the export inflation, you know,

00:09:23.836 --> 00:09:27.276 align:middle line:84%
it becomes more visible to the
average person which is why

00:09:27.276 --> 00:09:28.901 align:middle line:84%
you're seeing more
market manipulation,

00:09:28.901 --> 00:09:32.907 align:middle line:84%
more propaganda and of course
behind the scenes more money

00:09:32.907 --> 00:09:33.407 align:middle line:90%
printing.

00:09:33.407 --> 00:09:36.076 align:middle line:84%
>> Regina: Let's talk about--
let us go back to unemployment,

00:09:36.076 --> 00:09:38.612 align:middle line:84%
some of the unemployment
numbers, the real numbers.

00:09:38.612 --> 00:09:39.780 align:middle line:90%
>> Hoffman: Right.

00:09:39.780 --> 00:09:42.027 align:middle line:84%
Well, I was mentioning
the labor participation

00:09:42.027 --> 00:09:44.684 align:middle line:84%
rate, which generally means--
>> Regina: What does that mean?

00:09:44.684 --> 00:09:46.887 align:middle line:84%
>> Hoffman: In generally
means the amount of people

00:09:46.887 --> 00:09:50.824 align:middle line:84%
in the potential labor force
that are actually working.

00:09:50.824 --> 00:09:53.026 align:middle line:84%
So, what happens with
the government is

00:09:53.026 --> 00:09:56.997 align:middle line:84%
if you are unemployed for--
well it used to be 52 weeks,

00:09:56.997 --> 00:10:00.200 align:middle line:84%
now they've got up to 99 weeks
the unemployment benefits.

00:10:00.200 --> 00:10:01.134 align:middle line:90%
>> Regina: 99?

00:10:01.134 --> 00:10:03.509 align:middle line:84%
>> Hoffman: In some places 99
weeks which means why work,

00:10:03.509 --> 00:10:04.008 align:middle line:90%
right?

00:10:04.008 --> 00:10:04.704 align:middle line:90%
>> Regina: Yeah.

00:10:04.704 --> 00:10:06.106 align:middle line:90%
>> Hoffman: Or why try to work.

00:10:06.106 --> 00:10:09.443 align:middle line:84%
When you get out-- when
you no longer get benefits,

00:10:09.443 --> 00:10:11.778 align:middle line:84%
the government will no
longer consider you a person.

00:10:11.778 --> 00:10:15.382 align:middle line:84%
You're not in the denominator
of the unemployment rate.

00:10:15.382 --> 00:10:17.461 align:middle line:84%
So, as people--
less and less people

00:10:17.461 --> 00:10:20.672 align:middle line:84%
can get a job, less--
more and more people

00:10:20.672 --> 00:10:24.500 align:middle line:84%
fall off of that denominator
and therefore, the unemployment

00:10:24.500 --> 00:10:26.526 align:middle line:90%
rate looks like it's falling.

00:10:26.526 --> 00:10:29.329 align:middle line:84%
But labor participation which
shows the percentage of people

00:10:29.329 --> 00:10:31.131 align:middle line:84%
that can work,
that actually are,

00:10:31.131 --> 00:10:32.732 align:middle line:84%
has been plummeting
at a record rate.

00:10:32.732 --> 00:10:35.402 align:middle line:90%
In fact, we hit a 35 year low.

00:10:35.402 --> 00:10:38.405 align:middle line:84%
I would say we hit that
low about a year ago

00:10:38.405 --> 00:10:40.574 align:middle line:84%
and each month
it's gotten worse.

00:10:40.574 --> 00:10:43.414 align:middle line:84%
Last month was the lowest
it's been since I think,

00:10:43.414 --> 00:10:46.947 align:middle line:84%
was it 1980 or something
like that or 1978?

00:10:46.947 --> 00:10:48.742 align:middle line:84%
So, the true state
of the economy

00:10:48.742 --> 00:10:50.117 align:middle line:84%
is unemployment
is getting worse,

00:10:50.117 --> 00:10:51.852 align:middle line:90%
but that's only part of it.

00:10:51.852 --> 00:10:56.490 align:middle line:84%
The type of jobs, the quality
of the jobs is plunging,

00:10:56.490 --> 00:11:00.828 align:middle line:84%
is weakening because we've
lost all of our manufacturing

00:11:00.828 --> 00:11:01.328 align:middle line:90%
capability.

00:11:01.328 --> 00:11:03.799 align:middle line:84%
We sold it out to the east,
and part of-- >> Regina: Right.

00:11:03.799 --> 00:11:05.632 align:middle line:84%
>> Hoffman: It would
have gone there anyway,

00:11:05.632 --> 00:11:08.690 align:middle line:84%
because they have low cost, but
also because of all the trade

00:11:08.690 --> 00:11:13.573 align:middle line:84%
deals that were lobbied for in
the 1980s like GATT and NAFTA--

00:11:13.573 --> 00:11:14.674 align:middle line:90%
>> Regina: Right.

00:11:14.674 --> 00:11:16.548 align:middle line:84%
>> Hoffman: -- have
accelerated that process.

00:11:16.548 --> 00:11:19.053 align:middle line:84%
So, the jobs that we have now
which aren't even keeping up

00:11:19.053 --> 00:11:21.699 align:middle line:84%
with the growth
of the population:

00:11:21.699 --> 00:11:24.814 align:middle line:84%
waiters, bartenders, a lot
of part time jobs and we're

00:11:24.814 --> 00:11:26.584 align:middle line:84%
going to talk about
Obamacare and what

00:11:26.584 --> 00:11:28.522 align:middle line:84%
that's going to do--
>> Regina: Yup, we are.

00:11:28.522 --> 00:11:29.289 align:middle line:84%
>> Hoffman: -- with
the part time jobs.

00:11:29.289 --> 00:11:30.323 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:11:30.323 --> 00:11:33.450 align:middle line:84%
>> Regina: So, what is the true
percentage of unemployment look

00:11:33.450 --> 00:11:34.194 align:middle line:90%
like?

00:11:34.194 --> 00:11:37.597 align:middle line:84%
>> Hoffman: There's a guy named
John Williams and not the Star

00:11:37.597 --> 00:11:38.431 align:middle line:90%
Wars composer.

00:11:38.431 --> 00:11:39.533 align:middle line:90%
>> Regina: Yeah.

00:11:39.533 --> 00:11:41.491 align:middle line:84%
>> Hoffman: He has a
website called ShadowStats

00:11:41.491 --> 00:11:43.336 align:middle line:90%
and he's been doing alternative.

00:11:43.336 --> 00:11:47.407 align:middle line:84%
He's the premier alternative
economic information guy.

00:11:47.407 --> 00:11:49.549 align:middle line:84%
So, he's got the
real inflation rate

00:11:49.549 --> 00:11:53.113 align:middle line:84%
which has been hovering around
8 or 10 percent for years.

00:11:53.113 --> 00:11:54.833 align:middle line:84%
And when it comes
to unemployment

00:11:54.833 --> 00:11:56.208 align:middle line:84%
there's three
different measures.

00:11:56.208 --> 00:11:58.576 align:middle line:84%
The government gives their
bogus 7 percent or whatever

00:11:58.576 --> 00:12:00.053 align:middle line:90%
it is, 7 and a half.

00:12:00.053 --> 00:12:01.815 align:middle line:84%
And, you know, the
real rate-- if you

00:12:01.815 --> 00:12:03.960 align:middle line:84%
talk about people
who are-- as I put it

00:12:03.960 --> 00:12:06.660 align:middle line:84%
who can't pay the bills because
either they're not working

00:12:06.660 --> 00:12:09.456 align:middle line:84%
or they're working part time,
or they're not making enough

00:12:09.456 --> 00:12:10.497 align:middle line:90%
'cause it's minimum wage.

00:12:10.497 --> 00:12:13.002 align:middle line:84%
It's, you know, close to 25
percent-- >> Regina: Right.

00:12:13.002 --> 00:12:15.335 align:middle line:84%
>> Hoffman: -- which is not
far from the depression era.

00:12:15.335 --> 00:12:16.303 align:middle line:90%
>> Regina: 25 percent.

00:12:16.303 --> 00:12:17.011 align:middle line:90%
>> Hoffman: Yeah.

00:12:17.011 --> 00:12:17.838 align:middle line:90%
>> Regina: Yeah.

00:12:17.838 --> 00:12:19.673 align:middle line:84%
That's the number I've heard
bandied about about as well.

00:12:19.673 --> 00:12:20.440 align:middle line:90%
>> Hoffman: The underemployment.

00:12:20.440 --> 00:12:21.474 align:middle line:90%
>> Regina: Underemployment rate.

00:12:21.474 --> 00:12:22.183 align:middle line:90%
>> Hoffman: Yeah.

00:12:22.183 --> 00:12:23.890 align:middle line:84%
>> Regina: Yeah, which
is as significant.

00:12:23.890 --> 00:12:25.779 align:middle line:84%
I mean, that's the true
state of the economy.

00:12:25.779 --> 00:12:26.889 align:middle line:90%
>> Hoffman: Yes.

00:12:26.889 --> 00:12:28.805 align:middle line:84%
And when you've had a
fed that's been printing

00:12:28.805 --> 00:12:30.350 align:middle line:84%
unfettered money
for 40 years or,

00:12:30.350 --> 00:12:33.553 align:middle line:84%
you can go back-- it
started a hundred years ago.

00:12:33.553 --> 00:12:36.521 align:middle line:84%
Inflation has been so
bad that that trend only

00:12:36.521 --> 00:12:38.558 align:middle line:84%
makes the standard of
living that much worse

00:12:38.558 --> 00:12:41.728 align:middle line:84%
which is why we have all
time highs in food stamps

00:12:41.728 --> 00:12:44.431 align:middle line:84%
and disability and
entitlements of all kinds.

00:12:44.431 --> 00:12:45.732 align:middle line:90%
>> Regina: Yes.

00:12:45.732 --> 00:12:48.320 align:middle line:84%
OK, let's talk about federal
reserve tapering or taperings,

00:12:48.320 --> 00:12:49.236 align:middle line:90%
a subject of tapering.

00:12:49.236 --> 00:12:50.470 align:middle line:90%
What does that mean?

00:12:50.470 --> 00:12:51.438 align:middle line:90%
>> Hoffman: Right.

00:12:51.438 --> 00:12:54.307 align:middle line:84%
Well, the-- I'm sure everyone
listening has heard the term

00:12:54.307 --> 00:12:55.140 align:middle line:90%
quantitative easing.

00:12:55.140 --> 00:12:55.766 align:middle line:90%
>> Regina: Yes.

00:12:55.766 --> 00:12:58.140 align:middle line:84%
>> Hoffman: It's just a fed
euphemism for printing money.

00:12:58.140 --> 00:12:58.945 align:middle line:90%
>> Regina: Right.

00:12:58.945 --> 00:13:00.819 align:middle line:84%
>> Hoffman: Now, the
fed, generally speaking,

00:13:00.819 --> 00:13:04.529 align:middle line:84%
does kind of behind the scenes
printing money when it keeps

00:13:04.529 --> 00:13:07.492 align:middle line:84%
its fed funds rate at zero which
is where it's been for five

00:13:07.492 --> 00:13:09.656 align:middle line:84%
years, where they're--
on daily basis,

00:13:09.656 --> 00:13:13.293 align:middle line:84%
they're buying short term
bonds to keep rates down.

00:13:13.293 --> 00:13:15.009 align:middle line:84%
But quantitative
easing literally

00:13:15.009 --> 00:13:18.846 align:middle line:84%
means printing money and
monetizing well any kind

00:13:18.846 --> 00:13:19.866 align:middle line:90%
of securities.

00:13:19.866 --> 00:13:23.135 align:middle line:84%
Right now, they're monetizing
treasury bonds and mortgage

00:13:23.135 --> 00:13:25.827 align:middle line:84%
backed securities, probably
behind the scenes they're

00:13:25.827 --> 00:13:27.355 align:middle line:84%
monetizing stocks
because they have

00:13:27.355 --> 00:13:30.043 align:middle line:84%
- the President's working
group in financial markets.

00:13:30.043 --> 00:13:31.211 align:middle line:90%
It's their job to do that.

00:13:31.211 --> 00:13:32.078 align:middle line:90%
>> Regina: Right.

00:13:32.078 --> 00:13:33.536 align:middle line:84%
>> Hoffman: But
generally speaking,

00:13:33.536 --> 00:13:37.666 align:middle line:84%
since 2008 they've been on
an overt quantitative easing

00:13:37.666 --> 00:13:40.706 align:middle line:84%
program where they buy these
things every month to keep

00:13:40.706 --> 00:13:41.254 align:middle line:90%
rates down.

00:13:41.254 --> 00:13:45.123 align:middle line:84%
And unbelievably, they now own a
third of all the treasury bonds

00:13:45.123 --> 00:13:48.428 align:middle line:84%
outstanding and a half of all
the mortgage bonds outstanding,

00:13:48.428 --> 00:13:50.393 align:middle line:84%
plus they owned
Fannie Mae, so they

00:13:50.393 --> 00:13:52.518 align:middle line:84%
originate and own pretty
much every mortgage that's

00:13:52.518 --> 00:13:52.966 align:middle line:90%
out there.

00:13:52.966 --> 00:13:54.501 align:middle line:84%
>> Regina: And you say they're
also in the stock market

00:13:54.501 --> 00:13:55.914 align:middle line:90%
as well now, you think.

00:13:55.914 --> 00:13:58.038 align:middle line:84%
>> Hoffman: Oh, I know
they're in the stock market.

00:13:58.038 --> 00:13:59.906 align:middle line:90%
But they don't tell you that.

00:13:59.906 --> 00:14:02.676 align:middle line:84%
That's not something that
they give numbers for.

00:14:02.676 --> 00:14:04.559 align:middle line:84%
But for quantitative
easing, the fed

00:14:04.559 --> 00:14:07.480 align:middle line:84%
says we are buying now 85
billion dollars a month,

00:14:07.480 --> 00:14:10.150 align:middle line:84%
we are printing and buying
85 billion dollars a month

00:14:10.150 --> 00:14:11.697 align:middle line:84%
worth of treasuries
and mortgages

00:14:11.697 --> 00:14:14.464 align:middle line:84%
and just last week, they
reiterated that they're

00:14:14.464 --> 00:14:16.156 align:middle line:90%
doing it ad infinitum.

00:14:16.156 --> 00:14:18.378 align:middle line:84%
And at some point, they're
going to own all of them

00:14:18.378 --> 00:14:20.204 align:middle line:84%
and they have to
keep increasing it

00:14:20.204 --> 00:14:22.853 align:middle line:84%
because the only other
major owners in the world

00:14:22.853 --> 00:14:24.230 align:middle line:90%
are the Chinese and Japanese.

00:14:24.230 --> 00:14:26.774 align:middle line:84%
The Japanese have stopped
buying and the Chinese

00:14:26.774 --> 00:14:28.034 align:middle line:90%
are now actively selling.

00:14:28.034 --> 00:14:30.136 align:middle line:84%
So, when they talk
about tapering,

00:14:30.136 --> 00:14:31.671 align:middle line:90%
tapering is just a ruse.

00:14:31.671 --> 00:14:34.374 align:middle line:84%
It's been for the last five
years, in fact my piece

00:14:34.374 --> 00:14:37.410 align:middle line:84%
that I wrote today is about the
history of all these things.

00:14:37.410 --> 00:14:40.146 align:middle line:84%
At one point they called
it the exit strategy.

00:14:40.146 --> 00:14:42.816 align:middle line:84%
They said, we saw green
shoots of recovery

00:14:42.816 --> 00:14:46.753 align:middle line:84%
and this year it became tapering
which would mean slowing down,

00:14:46.753 --> 00:14:50.455 align:middle line:84%
not stopping, slowing down
the pace of printing money

00:14:50.455 --> 00:14:53.760 align:middle line:84%
and monetizing bonds But the
fact is they never do it,

00:14:53.760 --> 00:14:56.781 align:middle line:84%
because the economy keeps
getting worse and anytime they

00:14:56.781 --> 00:14:58.231 align:middle line:90%
even talk about it.

00:14:58.231 --> 00:14:59.743 align:middle line:84%
They started this
year in February

00:14:59.743 --> 00:15:01.070 align:middle line:90%
talking about it again.

00:15:01.070 --> 00:15:02.994 align:middle line:84%
Interest rates jumped
up and immediately

00:15:02.994 --> 00:15:05.099 align:middle line:84%
the fed governors came
out and say, no, we're

00:15:05.099 --> 00:15:05.739 align:middle line:90%
not going to do this.

00:15:05.739 --> 00:15:07.006 align:middle line:90%
>> Regina: Nope, can't do that.

00:15:07.006 --> 00:15:08.641 align:middle line:84%
>> Hoffman: And yet they still
said in September, I mean,

00:15:08.641 --> 00:15:10.099 align:middle line:84%
the media is saying
it's September.

00:15:10.099 --> 00:15:11.411 align:middle line:90%
Well, I think they might do it.

00:15:11.411 --> 00:15:13.313 align:middle line:84%
I was out there saying there's
not a chance they'll do it.

00:15:13.313 --> 00:15:14.047 align:middle line:90%
>> Regina: No way.

00:15:14.047 --> 00:15:15.148 align:middle line:90%
>> Hoffman: And they didn't.

00:15:15.148 --> 00:15:16.355 align:middle line:84%
>> Regina: Grind to a hault
the housing market and other

00:15:16.355 --> 00:15:17.146 align:middle line:90%
aspects of economy.

00:15:17.146 --> 00:15:17.855 align:middle line:90%
They can't do it.

00:15:17.855 --> 00:15:20.312 align:middle line:84%
>> Hoffman: The housing market
has rolled over dramatically

00:15:20.312 --> 00:15:22.615 align:middle line:84%
just since that dumb comment
that-- >> Regina: Yeah.

00:15:22.615 --> 00:15:23.823 align:middle line:90%
>> Hoffman: -- Bernanke made.

00:15:23.823 --> 00:15:25.948 align:middle line:84%
And all he said was, and
this was in June, he said,

00:15:25.948 --> 00:15:29.929 align:middle line:84%
"If the economy improves,
we might taper."

00:15:29.929 --> 00:15:31.698 align:middle line:90%
And the economy got worse.

00:15:31.698 --> 00:15:32.407 align:middle line:90%
>> Regina: Right.

00:15:32.407 --> 00:15:34.614 align:middle line:84%
>> Hoffman: And now the
government shutdown only made

00:15:34.614 --> 00:15:35.168 align:middle line:90%
things worse.

00:15:35.168 --> 00:15:37.737 align:middle line:84%
And now, they have another
government shutdown coming up

00:15:37.737 --> 00:15:39.639 align:middle line:84%
and now the housing
market's rolling over.

00:15:39.639 --> 00:15:40.874 align:middle line:90%
>> Regina: Exactly.

00:15:40.874 --> 00:15:43.082 align:middle line:84%
>> Hoffman: Any real economic
data you see out there,

00:15:43.082 --> 00:15:45.111 align:middle line:84%
not these diffusion
indices where it says well,

00:15:45.111 --> 00:15:47.680 align:middle line:84%
if it goes from 51 to
52, things are better.

00:15:47.680 --> 00:15:50.250 align:middle line:84%
Those are just surveys
that don't mean anything.

00:15:50.250 --> 00:15:53.234 align:middle line:84%
But if you look at
durable goods orders,

00:15:53.234 --> 00:15:55.505 align:middle line:84%
retail sales,
capital expenditures,

00:15:55.505 --> 00:15:58.610 align:middle line:84%
consumer confidence,
everything that's real

00:15:58.610 --> 00:16:00.727 align:middle line:90%
has been dramatically declining.

00:16:00.727 --> 00:16:03.696 align:middle line:84%
>> Regina: What about the--
every time we talk I forget.

00:16:03.696 --> 00:16:06.666 align:middle line:84%
I should write it down
beforehand-- the Baltic Index--

00:16:06.666 --> 00:16:07.700 align:middle line:90%
>> Hoffman: Dry Index.

00:16:07.700 --> 00:16:08.735 align:middle line:84%
>> Regina: -- Dry
Index, Baltic Dry Index.

00:16:08.735 --> 00:16:09.936 align:middle line:90%
>> Hoffman: Right.

00:16:09.936 --> 00:16:14.120 align:middle line:84%
The Baltic Dry Index
is a strange measure

00:16:14.120 --> 00:16:17.410 align:middle line:84%
of shipping because it
combines global shipping.

00:16:17.410 --> 00:16:19.145 align:middle line:90%
It combines-- >> Regina: Right.

00:16:19.145 --> 00:16:21.502 align:middle line:84%
>> Hoffman: -- the prices
of the-- the activity

00:16:21.502 --> 00:16:24.150 align:middle line:84%
of the tankers and the
prices of the tankers.

00:16:24.150 --> 00:16:26.397 align:middle line:84%
It can be misleading
though because there

00:16:26.397 --> 00:16:30.156 align:middle line:84%
was a huge glut when times were
good, five years ago or so,

00:16:30.156 --> 00:16:31.277 align:middle line:90%
when the economy was good.

00:16:31.277 --> 00:16:32.651 align:middle line:84%
A lot of these
shipping companies

00:16:32.651 --> 00:16:36.529 align:middle line:84%
built a huge amount of tankers
and that depressed demand

00:16:36.529 --> 00:16:38.932 align:middle line:84%
and prices simply 'cause
there were too many out there.

00:16:38.932 --> 00:16:40.990 align:middle line:84%
So, a part of its movement
has to do with-- >> Regina:

00:16:40.990 --> 00:16:41.968 align:middle line:84%
It's still correcting
the-- yeah.

00:16:41.968 --> 00:16:43.927 align:middle line:84%
>> Hoffman: -- factors that have
nothing to do-- >> Regina: OK,

00:16:43.927 --> 00:16:44.718 align:middle line:90%
we'll just move on.

00:16:44.718 --> 00:16:47.540 align:middle line:84%
>> Hoffman: But the fact is
it did fall to record levels

00:16:47.540 --> 00:16:50.212 align:middle line:84%
in 2008 and it stayed there
until very recently where it

00:16:50.212 --> 00:16:52.045 align:middle line:84%
started to move up and
now it's moving down.

00:16:52.045 --> 00:16:55.225 align:middle line:84%
But the fact is it's
still way below where

00:16:55.225 --> 00:16:56.282 align:middle line:90%
it was five years ago.

00:16:56.282 --> 00:16:57.684 align:middle line:84%
>> Regina: And it's a movement
of goods around the planet.

00:16:57.684 --> 00:16:58.451 align:middle line:90%
>> Hoffman: Yes.

00:16:58.451 --> 00:16:59.757 align:middle line:84%
>> Regina: Across the
ocean-- >> Hoffman: Yes,

00:16:59.757 --> 00:17:01.715 align:middle line:84%
and its' way below where
it was five years ago,

00:17:01.715 --> 00:17:04.224 align:middle line:84%
even with the recent
little blip higher.

00:17:04.224 --> 00:17:05.525 align:middle line:90%
>> Regina: Right.

00:17:05.525 --> 00:17:08.495 align:middle line:84%
I know this is a naive
question, but when

00:17:08.495 --> 00:17:12.093 align:middle line:84%
you have something that is
just so awful looming here

00:17:12.093 --> 00:17:14.426 align:middle line:84%
and you have one player sitting
in the middle of it that

00:17:14.426 --> 00:17:16.493 align:middle line:84%
has behaved so
badly, the U.S., I

00:17:16.493 --> 00:17:18.871 align:middle line:84%
mean there are some
other countries as well,

00:17:18.871 --> 00:17:23.743 align:middle line:84%
but we're in such a significant
position in the global economy,

00:17:23.743 --> 00:17:25.723 align:middle line:84%
is there such a thing
as too big to fail?

00:17:25.723 --> 00:17:27.514 align:middle line:84%
You talked about all
these other currencies

00:17:27.514 --> 00:17:29.682 align:middle line:84%
that have failed
throughout the history?

00:17:29.682 --> 00:17:33.762 align:middle line:84%
Can China, can the BRIC
nations, can Europe,

00:17:33.762 --> 00:17:36.189 align:middle line:84%
I mean-- >> Hoffman: Well,
they're all going to fail.

00:17:36.189 --> 00:17:38.625 align:middle line:84%
The way-- >> Regina: I mean
can the U.S.?-- I'm saying--

00:17:38.625 --> 00:17:41.922 align:middle line:84%
>> Hoffman: The United States,
the world ceded the United

00:17:41.922 --> 00:17:47.335 align:middle line:84%
States the ability to abuse
the global economy back in 1944

00:17:47.335 --> 00:17:49.168 align:middle line:84%
when it created the
Bretton Woods Agreement.

00:17:49.168 --> 00:17:49.938 align:middle line:90%
>> Regina: Right.

00:17:49.938 --> 00:17:52.438 align:middle line:84%
>> Hoffman: That gave the United
States the world's reserved

00:17:52.438 --> 00:17:52.972 align:middle line:90%
currency.

00:17:52.972 --> 00:17:53.768 align:middle line:90%
>> Regina: Right.

00:17:53.768 --> 00:17:55.642 align:middle line:84%
>> Hoffman: It valued
all currencies in terms

00:17:55.642 --> 00:17:58.961 align:middle line:84%
of the dollar, but it also
valued the dollar in terms

00:17:58.961 --> 00:17:59.512 align:middle line:90%
of gold.

00:17:59.512 --> 00:18:02.015 align:middle line:84%
So, there was a semi gold
backing to the world.

00:18:02.015 --> 00:18:04.811 align:middle line:84%
The problem was in 1971--
>> Regina: Bye-bye.

00:18:04.811 --> 00:18:06.519 align:middle line:84%
>> Hoffman: -- and I
say, Lyndon Johnson.

00:18:06.519 --> 00:18:08.721 align:middle line:84%
But again, all presidents
do these things.

00:18:08.721 --> 00:18:12.158 align:middle line:84%
But he in particular with the
Vietnam and his great society,

00:18:12.158 --> 00:18:15.324 align:middle line:84%
there was so much spending
that we knew we could not

00:18:15.324 --> 00:18:16.663 align:middle line:90%
keep spending like this.

00:18:16.663 --> 00:18:20.567 align:middle line:84%
So, as soon as he left
office, it hit the fan,

00:18:20.567 --> 00:18:22.775 align:middle line:84%
and of course Nixon
he just said, "Well

00:18:22.775 --> 00:18:25.338 align:middle line:84%
I'm just going to get rid of
it all together." >> Regina:

00:18:25.338 --> 00:18:25.838 align:middle line:90%
Right.

00:18:25.838 --> 00:18:26.940 align:middle line:84%
>> Hoffman: The world-- that
was the critical point in time,

00:18:26.940 --> 00:18:29.208 align:middle line:84%
because the rest of the
world could have said,

00:18:29.208 --> 00:18:31.210 align:middle line:84%
"You've breached this contract,
we're not going to let you."

00:18:31.210 --> 00:18:32.445 align:middle line:84%
>> Regina: Because now
we're a fiat currency.

00:18:32.445 --> 00:18:33.111 align:middle line:90%
>> Hoffman: Yes.

00:18:33.111 --> 00:18:33.778 align:middle line:90%
>> Regina: Yeah.

00:18:33.778 --> 00:18:36.236 align:middle line:84%
>> Hoffman: But the rest of
the world allowed us to do that

00:18:36.236 --> 00:18:39.061 align:middle line:84%
and said, "OK, we'll all be
fiat currencies." >> Regina: So,

00:18:39.061 --> 00:18:40.453 align:middle line:90%
that's what I'm asking.

00:18:40.453 --> 00:18:43.056 align:middle line:84%
We all somehow agreed
to do this together.

00:18:43.056 --> 00:18:45.725 align:middle line:84%
The nations agreed to
allow this to happen.

00:18:45.725 --> 00:18:50.945 align:middle line:84%
Can they allow us the
U.S., the dollar, the U.S.

00:18:50.945 --> 00:18:53.918 align:middle line:90%
economy to tank as it should?

00:18:53.918 --> 00:18:55.501 align:middle line:84%
>> Hoffman: Well,
they have no choice.

00:18:55.501 --> 00:18:58.137 align:middle line:84%
I mean it's going
to happen either way

00:18:58.137 --> 00:19:00.013 align:middle line:84%
and it's not a
matter-- what they

00:19:00.013 --> 00:19:02.709 align:middle line:84%
can do is try to
change their policies,

00:19:02.709 --> 00:19:06.545 align:middle line:84%
that's why you've seen so many
trade agreements between China

00:19:06.545 --> 00:19:08.003 align:middle line:84%
and all these
countries 'cause they

00:19:08.003 --> 00:19:09.949 align:middle line:90%
see the writing on the wall.

00:19:09.949 --> 00:19:12.885 align:middle line:84%
But the fact is they have all
have been on the fiat standard

00:19:12.885 --> 00:19:13.920 align:middle line:90%
for the last 40 years.

00:19:13.920 --> 00:19:14.821 align:middle line:90%
>> Regina: Right.

00:19:14.821 --> 00:19:16.274 align:middle line:84%
>> Hoffman: And they've all
racked up incredible debts

00:19:16.274 --> 00:19:16.982 align:middle line:90%
at the same rate.

00:19:16.982 --> 00:19:19.859 align:middle line:84%
In fact, more so,
than the United States

00:19:19.859 --> 00:19:22.328 align:middle line:84%
because they don't have
the reserve currency.

00:19:22.328 --> 00:19:24.183 align:middle line:84%
The don't have the
ability to print as much.

00:19:24.183 --> 00:19:26.099 align:middle line:84%
When they print-- even
if it's Europe compared

00:19:26.099 --> 00:19:29.002 align:middle line:84%
to United States, let alone
all these other countries,

00:19:29.002 --> 00:19:32.505 align:middle line:84%
it has greater ramifications
on their economy, on inflation.

00:19:32.505 --> 00:19:33.740 align:middle line:90%
>> Regina: Right.

00:19:33.740 --> 00:19:36.073 align:middle line:84%
>> Hoffman: So, they're in
even worst situation than us,

00:19:36.073 --> 00:19:39.491 align:middle line:84%
but the fact is they don't--
the only country that really has

00:19:39.491 --> 00:19:42.248 align:middle line:84%
any ability to do anything
about it is China.

00:19:42.248 --> 00:19:43.383 align:middle line:90%
>> Regina: Is China, yeah.

00:19:43.383 --> 00:19:45.466 align:middle line:84%
>> Hoffman: And they are
doing something about it,

00:19:45.466 --> 00:19:48.252 align:middle line:84%
because they know that the
Yuan is going to be the next

00:19:48.252 --> 00:19:52.091 align:middle line:84%
reserved currency and it may not
be tomorrow but it will happen.

00:19:52.091 --> 00:19:54.581 align:middle line:84%
>> Regina: Does the rest of
the planet understand people,

00:19:54.581 --> 00:19:57.627 align:middle line:84%
anyone in the know, anywhere
in the world when it comes

00:19:57.627 --> 00:20:00.633 align:middle line:84%
to global economics, understand
that the Yuan or the Renminbi,

00:20:00.633 --> 00:20:03.297 align:middle line:84%
the Chinese currency will
be the next-- >> Hoffman:

00:20:03.297 --> 00:20:04.704 align:middle line:90%
Anyone who's not in denial.

00:20:04.704 --> 00:20:07.294 align:middle line:84%
Anyone who's a
realist like we are

00:20:07.294 --> 00:20:09.609 align:middle line:84%
understands that, because
it's just simple math.

00:20:09.609 --> 00:20:13.746 align:middle line:84%
The Chinese have been
buying gold hand over fist

00:20:13.746 --> 00:20:15.181 align:middle line:90%
for the past few decades.

00:20:15.181 --> 00:20:16.919 align:middle line:84%
>> Regina: Tons >> Hoffman:
But particularly the last few

00:20:16.919 --> 00:20:18.184 align:middle line:90%
years, it's really incredible.

00:20:18.184 --> 00:20:20.606 align:middle line:84%
Last year was a record
for them for buying gold

00:20:20.606 --> 00:20:22.689 align:middle line:84%
and this year they're going
to double that amount.

00:20:22.689 --> 00:20:23.322 align:middle line:90%
>> Regina: Yeah.

00:20:23.322 --> 00:20:24.197 align:middle line:90%
>> Hoffman: At least.

00:20:24.197 --> 00:20:25.158 align:middle line:90%
>> Regina: Yeah.

00:20:25.158 --> 00:20:27.768 align:middle line:84%
>> Hoffman: Because they
know that the only monitory

00:20:27.768 --> 00:20:30.846 align:middle line:84%
standards that ever worked, that
do not allow for this inflation

00:20:30.846 --> 00:20:31.898 align:middle line:90%
are gold standards.

00:20:31.898 --> 00:20:34.579 align:middle line:84%
They also have the
largest manufacturing base

00:20:34.579 --> 00:20:38.107 align:middle line:84%
in the world and the largest
currency reserves, which

00:20:38.107 --> 00:20:41.941 align:middle line:84%
right now they're actively using
to buy things of real value,

00:20:41.941 --> 00:20:44.210 align:middle line:84%
such as gold and
other commodities.

00:20:44.210 --> 00:20:47.413 align:middle line:84%
>> Regina: So, what is the--you
touched on it a minute ago

00:20:47.413 --> 00:20:49.582 align:middle line:84%
but just to do a
little round up for us.

00:20:49.582 --> 00:20:54.654 align:middle line:84%
What is the state of the
global economy at present?

00:20:54.654 --> 00:20:56.923 align:middle line:84%
>> Hoffman: I would say it's
the worst that it's been

00:20:56.923 --> 00:20:59.659 align:middle line:84%
in our lifetimes
across the board.

00:20:59.659 --> 00:21:02.295 align:middle line:84%
I mean, that you know,
they can put out from time

00:21:02.295 --> 00:21:03.870 align:middle line:84%
to time numbers that
make things look

00:21:03.870 --> 00:21:05.598 align:middle line:84%
like, "Oh this one is
doing a little better,

00:21:05.598 --> 00:21:06.699 align:middle line:90%
it's doing a little worse."

00:21:06.699 --> 00:21:08.615 align:middle line:84%
I mean I'm seeing things
about they're talking

00:21:08.615 --> 00:21:10.002 align:middle line:90%
about the Spanish recovery.

00:21:10.002 --> 00:21:11.423 align:middle line:84%
And then, you look
at the numbers

00:21:11.423 --> 00:21:13.791 align:middle line:84%
and you go, "Well, their
housing-- their housing

00:21:13.791 --> 00:21:15.174 align:middle line:90%
never blipped up at all".

00:21:15.174 --> 00:21:16.375 align:middle line:90%
>> Regina: No.

00:21:16.375 --> 00:21:17.343 align:middle line:84%
>> Hoffman: It's been free
fall, it just hit a new low.

00:21:17.343 --> 00:21:18.911 align:middle line:84%
>> Regina: It's so
low, I mean, people--

00:21:18.911 --> 00:21:21.160 align:middle line:84%
people that shouldn't even
buy a motorcycle or saying,

00:21:21.160 --> 00:21:24.463 align:middle line:84%
"Oh I'm buying a house on the
coast of Spain." >> Hoffman:

00:21:24.463 --> 00:21:27.622 align:middle line:84%
Their bad debt at their bank
just hit an all time high last

00:21:27.622 --> 00:21:28.121 align:middle line:90%
month.

00:21:28.121 --> 00:21:30.749 align:middle line:84%
Their unemployment-- the
unemployment rate in Europe

00:21:30.749 --> 00:21:32.391 align:middle line:90%
is at an all time high.

00:21:32.391 --> 00:21:33.803 align:middle line:84%
In fact the
European-- >> Regina:

00:21:33.803 --> 00:21:34.494 align:middle line:90%
Approximately what real numbers?

00:21:34.494 --> 00:21:36.095 align:middle line:84%
>> Hoffman: 12.2 percent
in their numbers.

00:21:36.095 --> 00:21:36.863 align:middle line:90%
>> Regina: Yeah, real numbers.

00:21:36.863 --> 00:21:38.858 align:middle line:84%
>> Hoffman: Their numbers, but
who knows what the real number

00:21:38.858 --> 00:21:39.232 align:middle line:90%
is in Europe.

00:21:39.232 --> 00:21:39.999 align:middle line:90%
>> Regina: Right.

00:21:39.999 --> 00:21:41.134 align:middle line:90%
>> Hoffman: It's a lot higher.

00:21:41.134 --> 00:21:43.136 align:middle line:84%
And the European commission
today, this morning,

00:21:43.136 --> 00:21:47.016 align:middle line:84%
said we expect 12.2 to
remain through all of 2014

00:21:47.016 --> 00:21:50.862 align:middle line:84%
going down to only 11.8 in
2015 and of course they're

00:21:50.862 --> 00:21:51.778 align:middle line:90%
always overestimating.

00:21:51.778 --> 00:21:53.212 align:middle line:90%
That's how bad things are.

00:21:53.212 --> 00:21:57.083 align:middle line:84%
So, when you talk about 2008,
oh 2008, things were so bad.

00:21:57.083 --> 00:21:59.585 align:middle line:84%
It was 11 percent of
10 and a half percent.

00:21:59.585 --> 00:22:03.705 align:middle line:84%
Now it's 12.2 and think
of how low the debt

00:22:03.705 --> 00:22:06.652 align:middle line:84%
levels and money supply levels
were in Europe back then.

00:22:06.652 --> 00:22:07.360 align:middle line:90%
>> Regina: Right.

00:22:07.360 --> 00:22:09.395 align:middle line:84%
>> Hoffman: But now-- >>
Regina: Compared to now.

00:22:09.395 --> 00:22:10.563 align:middle line:84%
>> Hoffman: But now because
they've manipulated the market

00:22:10.563 --> 00:22:13.065 align:middle line:84%
higher with all this printed
money, they say, "Well,

00:22:13.065 --> 00:22:15.435 align:middle line:84%
things are better,"
but they're not better.

00:22:15.435 --> 00:22:21.207 align:middle line:84%
The people are in poverty
right now and in some places,

00:22:21.207 --> 00:22:22.852 align:middle line:90%
France is a perfect example.

00:22:22.852 --> 00:22:24.310 align:middle line:84%
They're on the
verge of revolution.

00:22:24.310 --> 00:22:26.066 align:middle line:84%
I mean this Hollande guy
came into office-- >> Regina:

00:22:26.066 --> 00:22:27.357 align:middle line:90%
Well, they know how to do that.

00:22:27.357 --> 00:22:28.381 align:middle line:90%
>> Hoffman: They do.

00:22:28.381 --> 00:22:29.849 align:middle line:84%
>> Regina: You know, the French,
I totally admire the French.

00:22:29.849 --> 00:22:30.750 align:middle line:90%
They have courage.

00:22:30.750 --> 00:22:32.952 align:middle line:84%
When they don't like
it, you know, the kids

00:22:32.952 --> 00:22:34.053 align:middle line:90%
start breaking windows.

00:22:34.053 --> 00:22:35.221 align:middle line:90%
I'm not advocating this.

00:22:35.221 --> 00:22:39.225 align:middle line:84%
I'm saying they do
something about it.

00:22:39.225 --> 00:22:41.313 align:middle line:84%
>> Hoffman: What I've read
as the most important,

00:22:41.313 --> 00:22:43.062 align:middle line:84%
the scariest number
in the world is what--

00:22:43.062 --> 00:22:45.698 align:middle line:84%
they call in Europe the
youth employment rate.

00:22:45.698 --> 00:22:46.699 align:middle line:90%
>> Regina: Yes.

00:22:46.699 --> 00:22:49.015 align:middle line:84%
>> Hoffman: It is -- I think
they use 30 as the cutoff,

00:22:49.015 --> 00:22:49.669 align:middle line:90%
or 35.

00:22:49.669 --> 00:22:50.670 align:middle line:90%
>> Regina: Yup.

00:22:50.670 --> 00:22:51.838 align:middle line:84%
What's youth employment
rate in France?

00:22:51.838 --> 00:22:53.573 align:middle line:84%
>> Hoffman: And the youth
employment rate in Europe,

00:22:53.573 --> 00:22:54.707 align:middle line:90%
in the PIIGS as called.

00:22:54.707 --> 00:22:55.808 align:middle line:90%
>> Regina: Yeah.

00:22:55.808 --> 00:22:57.808 align:middle line:84%
>> Hoffman: And that's a
lot of population, is--

00:22:57.808 --> 00:23:01.881 align:middle line:84%
it's 40 percent, in Spain and
Greece it's 50 to 60 percent.

00:23:01.881 --> 00:23:03.850 align:middle line:84%
And I haven't seen the
exact number for France,

00:23:03.850 --> 00:23:05.785 align:middle line:84%
but I assure you
it's pretty high.

00:23:05.785 --> 00:23:07.920 align:middle line:90%
It's probably 30 plus percent.

00:23:07.920 --> 00:23:09.856 align:middle line:90%
And these people are revolting.

00:23:09.856 --> 00:23:11.924 align:middle line:84%
This Hollande guy,
he's been in office

00:23:11.924 --> 00:23:13.526 align:middle line:90%
for a year, year and a half.

00:23:13.526 --> 00:23:15.321 align:middle line:84%
He comes in-- he's
basically communist.

00:23:15.321 --> 00:23:16.362 align:middle line:90%
That's what I called him.

00:23:16.362 --> 00:23:17.296 align:middle line:90%
>> Regina: Right.

00:23:17.296 --> 00:23:19.800 align:middle line:84%
>> Hoffman: He's taxing them
so high that the economy is

00:23:19.800 --> 00:23:20.299 align:middle line:90%
collapsing.

00:23:20.299 --> 00:23:22.168 align:middle line:84%
And now he has the
lowest approval rating

00:23:22.168 --> 00:23:26.370 align:middle line:84%
of any French president in
history, matching by the way

00:23:26.370 --> 00:23:29.477 align:middle line:84%
Obama's lowest approval rate
since he's gotten into office.

00:23:29.477 --> 00:23:30.643 align:middle line:90%
>> Regina: That's dangerous.

00:23:30.643 --> 00:23:33.766 align:middle line:84%
I was there many, many
years ago when Mitterrand

00:23:33.766 --> 00:23:36.539 align:middle line:84%
was elected and
watched what happened

00:23:36.539 --> 00:23:39.579 align:middle line:84%
in the more liberal
Latin quarter,

00:23:39.579 --> 00:23:41.120 align:middle line:84%
for example, where
the students were.

00:23:41.120 --> 00:23:43.106 align:middle line:84%
I've never seen
anything like it.

00:23:43.106 --> 00:23:45.424 align:middle line:90%
I did all but run for cover.

00:23:45.424 --> 00:23:48.361 align:middle line:84%
The people were smashing
business windows.

00:23:48.361 --> 00:23:50.418 align:middle line:84%
There were fires and
things and-- >> Hoffman:

00:23:50.418 --> 00:23:50.863 align:middle line:90%
And we've seen that.

00:23:50.863 --> 00:23:52.548 align:middle line:84%
>> Regina: -- it sounds
like we're there --

00:23:52.548 --> 00:23:53.065 align:middle line:90%
they're there again.

00:23:53.065 --> 00:23:55.356 align:middle line:84%
>> Hoffman: We've seen that
this year around the world.

00:23:55.356 --> 00:23:57.503 align:middle line:84%
I mean people again go
back to this Fragile Five.

00:23:57.503 --> 00:24:00.673 align:middle line:84%
It simply means the five--
these five currencies--

00:24:00.673 --> 00:24:02.008 align:middle line:90%
>> Regina: What are they?

00:24:02.008 --> 00:24:04.933 align:middle line:84%
>> Hoffman: India,
Indonesia, Turkey,

00:24:04.933 --> 00:24:07.280 align:middle line:90%
Brazil and South Africa.

00:24:07.280 --> 00:24:10.335 align:middle line:84%
They account for a quarter
of the world's population.

00:24:10.335 --> 00:24:12.418 align:middle line:84%
>> Regina: It's different
than the BRIC countries.

00:24:12.418 --> 00:24:13.185 align:middle line:90%
>> Hoffman: Yes.

00:24:13.185 --> 00:24:14.401 align:middle line:84%
>> Regina: This is a
different-- >> Hoffman:

00:24:14.401 --> 00:24:15.021 align:middle line:90%
This is the Fragile Five.

00:24:15.021 --> 00:24:16.622 align:middle line:84%
It's kind of a
take on the PIIGS,

00:24:16.622 --> 00:24:19.158 align:middle line:84%
'cause these five currencies
have, on average, fallen

00:24:19.158 --> 00:24:21.661 align:middle line:84%
over 30 percent in
the last two years.

00:24:21.661 --> 00:24:23.896 align:middle line:84%
And they have a quarter
of the world's population.

00:24:23.896 --> 00:24:27.031 align:middle line:84%
So, it's not a surprise that
Greece on the verge of collapse

00:24:27.031 --> 00:24:27.700 align:middle line:90%
right now.

00:24:27.700 --> 00:24:30.867 align:middle line:84%
They had riots in Turkey, major
riots in Brazil this year,

00:24:30.867 --> 00:24:31.837 align:middle line:90%
all about inflation.

00:24:31.837 --> 00:24:34.507 align:middle line:84%
And don't forget Egypt,
you know, the Arab Spring.

00:24:34.507 --> 00:24:37.710 align:middle line:84%
The Arab Spring is about
the fed exporting inflation.

00:24:37.710 --> 00:24:39.660 align:middle line:84%
The reason these
currencies have fallen

00:24:39.660 --> 00:24:42.882 align:middle line:84%
30 percent in the last two
years is because two years ago,

00:24:42.882 --> 00:24:45.366 align:middle line:84%
pretty much the month
is when the fed started

00:24:45.366 --> 00:24:46.546 align:middle line:90%
with QE3-- >> Regina: Right.

00:24:46.546 --> 00:24:48.754 align:middle line:84%
>> Hoffman: -- which has
been their most aggressive--

00:24:48.754 --> 00:24:50.890 align:middle line:84%
combined it with QE4,
what they're doing now.

00:24:50.890 --> 00:24:51.991 align:middle line:90%
>> Regina: Right.

00:24:51.991 --> 00:24:52.658 align:middle line:84%
>> Hoffman: Their most
aggressive money printing

00:24:52.658 --> 00:24:53.993 align:middle line:90%
to date.

00:24:53.993 --> 00:24:57.617 align:middle line:84%
And what happens is that
money--that money here,

00:24:57.617 --> 00:25:00.926 align:middle line:84%
it isn't-- doesn't do as much
damage to inflation as it does

00:25:00.926 --> 00:25:01.634 align:middle line:90%
around the world.

00:25:01.634 --> 00:25:06.038 align:middle line:84%
It just goes out into the global
markets and causes inflation.

00:25:06.038 --> 00:25:09.976 align:middle line:84%
And so, you know, that's what's
going on around the world.

00:25:09.976 --> 00:25:11.696 align:middle line:84%
And the more that
the fed prints now

00:25:11.696 --> 00:25:14.113 align:middle line:84%
and I predict that they're
going to be doing a QE5.

00:25:14.113 --> 00:25:16.849 align:middle line:84%
Probably a lot sooner
than people can think,

00:25:16.849 --> 00:25:19.285 align:middle line:84%
it's only going to cause a
greater amount of inflation

00:25:19.285 --> 00:25:21.949 align:middle line:84%
around the world and
eventually it'll, you know,

00:25:21.949 --> 00:25:24.523 align:middle line:84%
I'd say it's like a totem
pole, and we're at the top,

00:25:24.523 --> 00:25:26.058 align:middle line:84%
because we're the
reserve currency.

00:25:26.058 --> 00:25:28.908 align:middle line:84%
And eventually, the cancer
is going to up the totem

00:25:28.908 --> 00:25:31.323 align:middle line:84%
pole and give us the
kind of rampant inflation

00:25:31.323 --> 00:25:35.101 align:middle line:84%
that they've seen in India
and Indonesia and Brazil.

00:25:35.101 --> 00:25:38.771 align:middle line:84%
>> Regina: India was just on the
verge of becoming a real player

00:25:38.771 --> 00:25:41.901 align:middle line:84%
in certain industries,
what's happened with them?

00:25:41.901 --> 00:25:43.609 align:middle line:84%
>> Hoffman: The way
I put it with Brazil,

00:25:43.609 --> 00:25:45.569 align:middle line:84%
it's kind of like an
apartheid situation,

00:25:45.569 --> 00:25:49.415 align:middle line:84%
where you had in South Africa,
you had a small minority

00:25:49.415 --> 00:25:53.805 align:middle line:84%
of white people governing
hostilely a large majority

00:25:53.805 --> 00:25:55.721 align:middle line:84%
of black people and look
what happened, right?

00:25:55.721 --> 00:25:57.056 align:middle line:90%
>> Regina: Right.

00:25:57.056 --> 00:25:58.457 align:middle line:84%
>> Hoffman: Of course, there was
civil unrest then they kicked

00:25:58.457 --> 00:25:59.392 align:middle line:90%
them out.

00:25:59.392 --> 00:26:01.894 align:middle line:84%
In India which is
steeped in tradition

00:26:01.894 --> 00:26:05.292 align:middle line:84%
as the most gold loving nation
on the planet-- >> Regina: Yes.

00:26:05.292 --> 00:26:07.833 align:middle line:84%
>> Hoffman: -- where if you ask
the average Indian, you know,

00:26:07.833 --> 00:26:10.242 align:middle line:84%
how do you measure your wealth,
they're not going to say

00:26:10.242 --> 00:26:10.742 align:middle line:90%
rupees.

00:26:10.742 --> 00:26:13.172 align:middle line:84%
They're going to say real
items of value like gold.

00:26:13.172 --> 00:26:15.007 align:middle line:84%
>> Regina: I've seen
women who have nothing.

00:26:15.007 --> 00:26:19.945 align:middle line:84%
They're dirt poor, they're
selling cow dung patties to get

00:26:19.945 --> 00:26:22.782 align:middle line:84%
by with gold bracelets on 'cause
it was still what they have

00:26:22.782 --> 00:26:23.582 align:middle line:90%
left from their dowry. -- Yes.

00:26:23.582 --> 00:26:24.884 align:middle line:90%
>> Hoffman: That's their money.

00:26:24.884 --> 00:26:26.054 align:middle line:84%
It's more than a third
of all their wealth

00:26:26.054 --> 00:26:28.120 align:middle line:84%
is gold whereas in United
States it's probably 1 percent.

00:26:28.120 --> 00:26:29.722 align:middle line:84%
>> Regina: So what
does this mean?

00:26:29.722 --> 00:26:32.758 align:middle line:84%
>> Hoffman: Well, it means
that the central bankers--

00:26:32.758 --> 00:26:34.799 align:middle line:84%
again every central banker
is part of the system,

00:26:34.799 --> 00:26:36.062 align:middle line:90%
the fiat system.

00:26:36.062 --> 00:26:39.598 align:middle line:84%
And in India they allowed
them to get in power.

00:26:39.598 --> 00:26:42.802 align:middle line:84%
And there's some small
minority of people

00:26:42.802 --> 00:26:46.405 align:middle line:84%
that are printing money are
fighting a nation of people

00:26:46.405 --> 00:26:48.741 align:middle line:84%
who hate it and
want the real thing.

00:26:48.741 --> 00:26:50.176 align:middle line:84%
So, you've seen
an utter collapse

00:26:50.176 --> 00:26:53.346 align:middle line:84%
of the rupee this
year, huge inflation.

00:26:53.346 --> 00:26:55.095 align:middle line:84%
You know, I think that
there's going to be

00:26:55.095 --> 00:26:56.219 align:middle line:90%
civil unrest at some point.

00:26:56.219 --> 00:26:59.452 align:middle line:84%
In fact, what they just did
a few a month or two ago

00:26:59.452 --> 00:27:01.421 align:middle line:84%
and saying that the
government--they see this

00:27:01.421 --> 00:27:01.921 align:middle line:90%
happening.

00:27:01.921 --> 00:27:05.657 align:middle line:84%
They made a law-- a
policy where they're

00:27:05.657 --> 00:27:09.211 align:middle line:84%
going to be buying on
the open market, rice

00:27:09.211 --> 00:27:12.109 align:middle line:84%
and selling it to the
800 million people

00:27:12.109 --> 00:27:14.366 align:middle line:90%
for like a penny a pound.

00:27:14.366 --> 00:27:17.570 align:middle line:84%
So, basically, they've given
themselves an open ended.

00:27:17.570 --> 00:27:19.601 align:middle line:84%
They have to buy in
an open ended market

00:27:19.601 --> 00:27:20.539 align:middle line:90%
if rice prices go up.

00:27:20.539 --> 00:27:21.248 align:middle line:90%
>> Regina: Right.

00:27:21.248 --> 00:27:22.914 align:middle line:84%
>> Hoffman: The nation
will go bankrupt.

00:27:22.914 --> 00:27:24.955 align:middle line:84%
And so, it's just a
really insane situation

00:27:24.955 --> 00:27:26.679 align:middle line:90%
going on in India.

00:27:26.679 --> 00:27:27.746 align:middle line:90%
>> Regina: OK.

00:27:27.746 --> 00:27:29.982 align:middle line:84%
I was going to ask a
little more about Thailand

00:27:29.982 --> 00:27:31.150 align:middle line:90%
and some other countries.

00:27:31.150 --> 00:27:33.940 align:middle line:84%
But I wanted to get on
to the headlines that

00:27:33.940 --> 00:27:35.788 align:middle line:84%
are-- that have been
surfacing lately,

00:27:35.788 --> 00:27:39.758 align:middle line:84%
that the stock market is
expected to rise over 20,000.

00:27:39.758 --> 00:27:42.461 align:middle line:84%
And people are getting really
drunk on this news and people

00:27:42.461 --> 00:27:45.026 align:middle line:84%
who have been out of
the market since 2008,

00:27:45.026 --> 00:27:47.248 align:middle line:84%
I'm hearing and
noticing, even my father,

00:27:47.248 --> 00:27:50.553 align:middle line:84%
"Well I think it's time to
get back in, it's-- looks like

00:27:50.553 --> 00:27:51.504 align:middle line:90%
it's perking back up."

00:27:51.504 --> 00:27:52.738 align:middle line:90%
What's really happening?

00:27:52.738 --> 00:27:56.357 align:middle line:84%
>> Hoffman: Well, the mainstream
media is always going to just

00:27:56.357 --> 00:27:57.313 align:middle line:90%
be sheep-like.

00:27:57.313 --> 00:27:59.812 align:middle line:84%
Whatever is moving, that's what
they're going to talk about.

00:27:59.812 --> 00:28:02.081 align:middle line:84%
And of course they
are, you know,

00:28:02.081 --> 00:28:04.963 align:middle line:84%
their ulterior motive is to
cheerlead because they're

00:28:04.963 --> 00:28:07.552 align:middle line:84%
all part of this system,
everything is fine,

00:28:07.552 --> 00:28:08.687 align:middle line:90%
everything is fine.

00:28:08.687 --> 00:28:11.257 align:middle line:84%
And when it comes to stock
market, first of all,

00:28:11.257 --> 00:28:14.260 align:middle line:84%
in real terms, the stock
market is down 70 percent

00:28:14.260 --> 00:28:16.128 align:middle line:90%
since the turn of the century.

00:28:16.128 --> 00:28:18.597 align:middle line:84%
Meaning if you
take out inflation.

00:28:18.597 --> 00:28:21.387 align:middle line:84%
Not to mention if you--
the fact that the survivor

00:28:21.387 --> 00:28:24.288 align:middle line:84%
bias in the DOW itself,
you get rid of companies

00:28:24.288 --> 00:28:26.038 align:middle line:84%
that were collapsing--
>> Regina: Exactly.

00:28:26.038 --> 00:28:28.389 align:middle line:84%
>> Hoffman: -- like General
Motors and Citiroup,

00:28:28.389 --> 00:28:31.036 align:middle line:84%
Eastman Kodak-- >> Regina: Take
them out of the portfolio there

00:28:31.036 --> 00:28:33.036 align:middle line:84%
and you don't record on
them-- >> Hoffman: Yeah,

00:28:33.036 --> 00:28:33.646 align:middle line:90%
and it didn't do quite as well.

00:28:33.646 --> 00:28:34.346 align:middle line:90%
>> Regina: Right.

00:28:34.346 --> 00:28:36.679 align:middle line:84%
>> Hoffman: But what you--
mainly what you've had is all

00:28:36.679 --> 00:28:39.020 align:middle line:84%
this money printing which
essentially goes to the banks.

00:28:39.020 --> 00:28:40.853 align:middle line:84%
I mean when the fed
keeps the rates at zero,

00:28:40.853 --> 00:28:43.689 align:middle line:84%
that's mean they're buying
bonds from the big banks

00:28:43.689 --> 00:28:45.860 align:middle line:84%
that they've saved
and the big banks just

00:28:45.860 --> 00:28:47.193 align:middle line:90%
speculate in the market with it.

00:28:47.193 --> 00:28:49.261 align:middle line:84%
They haven't been
lending at all.

00:28:49.261 --> 00:28:50.763 align:middle line:90%
The lending has been collapsing.

00:28:50.763 --> 00:28:52.221 align:middle line:84%
So, they're really
just speculating

00:28:52.221 --> 00:28:53.987 align:middle line:84%
in the market, and
then of course,

00:28:53.987 --> 00:28:56.267 align:middle line:84%
the government through
its presidential working

00:28:56.267 --> 00:28:58.938 align:middle line:84%
group on financial markets,
you know boosts it further.

00:28:58.938 --> 00:29:01.893 align:middle line:84%
Retail participation
as you mentioned

00:29:01.893 --> 00:29:04.510 align:middle line:84%
has been as low
as it's ever been.

00:29:04.510 --> 00:29:07.813 align:middle line:84%
First in 2000 and
2002 market crash,

00:29:07.813 --> 00:29:09.315 align:middle line:90%
people lost their shirts.

00:29:09.315 --> 00:29:11.417 align:middle line:90%
Back then it was Greenspan.

00:29:11.417 --> 00:29:15.788 align:middle line:84%
He lowered rates to nothing,
he sparked a real state bubble.

00:29:15.788 --> 00:29:18.469 align:middle line:84%
People got in on
that because that's

00:29:18.469 --> 00:29:20.326 align:middle line:90%
what people do at the top.

00:29:20.326 --> 00:29:21.727 align:middle line:90%
They went bust again.

00:29:21.727 --> 00:29:24.530 align:middle line:84%
And now, this is the
ultimate with all the QE,

00:29:24.530 --> 00:29:27.700 align:middle line:84%
they've actually created a new
bubble in the stock market.

00:29:27.700 --> 00:29:30.002 align:middle line:84%
But this time it
hasn't been the retail.

00:29:30.002 --> 00:29:31.794 align:middle line:84%
It's not like you
know any neighbors who

00:29:31.794 --> 00:29:34.273 align:middle line:84%
are making tons of money in
the stock market these days,

00:29:34.273 --> 00:29:36.023 align:middle line:84%
'cause they've all
been out of the market.

00:29:36.023 --> 00:29:39.367 align:middle line:84%
So, as you said, all of a sudden
the market's been going up

00:29:39.367 --> 00:29:40.867 align:middle line:84%
and they're starting
to write about,

00:29:40.867 --> 00:29:43.642 align:middle line:84%
"Oh, it's going to go to the
moon," and just the last month

00:29:43.642 --> 00:29:46.871 align:middle line:84%
or two, we've started to see
retail participation start

00:29:46.871 --> 00:29:49.877 align:middle line:84%
to increase just as
interest rates are starting

00:29:49.877 --> 00:29:52.725 align:middle line:84%
to increase as well which is
the debt of the stock market.

00:29:52.725 --> 00:29:55.515 align:middle line:84%
It's just typical stuff,
but this time around there's

00:29:55.515 --> 00:29:58.497 align:middle line:84%
going to be nothing left because
when we have the next crash,

00:29:58.497 --> 00:30:01.260 align:middle line:84%
the fed can't say, "Oh, we're
going to just print money."

00:30:01.260 --> 00:30:02.801 align:middle line:84%
The fed is already
bought everything.

00:30:02.801 --> 00:30:05.506 align:middle line:84%
>> Regina: And people are
becoming very weary of that

00:30:05.506 --> 00:30:06.005 align:middle line:90%
message.

00:30:06.005 --> 00:30:08.907 align:middle line:84%
And now there's the type
of anxiety that's going on,

00:30:08.907 --> 00:30:10.943 align:middle line:90%
kind of collective anxiety.

00:30:10.943 --> 00:30:13.479 align:middle line:84%
I mean I'm speaking
from-- we're in the U.S.,

00:30:13.479 --> 00:30:17.116 align:middle line:84%
so I can certainly sense it
and I hear about it around me.

00:30:17.116 --> 00:30:20.152 align:middle line:84%
And one can only imagine what
it's like in Greece, Spain,

00:30:20.152 --> 00:30:22.454 align:middle line:90%
France, and other countries.

00:30:22.454 --> 00:30:25.691 align:middle line:84%
What-- I mean this
anxiety there--

00:30:25.691 --> 00:30:28.560 align:middle line:84%
this is reflecting something
of a mass consciousness.

00:30:28.560 --> 00:30:31.265 align:middle line:84%
We talked in the beginning about
the con game-- the confidence

00:30:31.265 --> 00:30:31.765 align:middle line:90%
game.

00:30:31.765 --> 00:30:34.767 align:middle line:84%
When does this anxiety
start showing itself

00:30:34.767 --> 00:30:36.078 align:middle line:90%
as a loss of confidence?

00:30:36.078 --> 00:30:38.203 align:middle line:84%
>> Hoffman: Well, again,
it's, you know, you have--

00:30:38.203 --> 00:30:42.107 align:middle line:84%
the 99 percent as Romney
put it, and the one percent.

00:30:42.107 --> 00:30:44.009 align:middle line:84%
And that gap is getting
larger and larger

00:30:44.009 --> 00:30:46.753 align:middle line:84%
because these policies
which are really just kick

00:30:46.753 --> 00:30:49.561 align:middle line:84%
the can policies
as far as possible

00:30:49.561 --> 00:30:51.684 align:middle line:90%
are heavily favoring the rich.

00:30:51.684 --> 00:30:54.412 align:middle line:84%
These-- particularly the
bankers and the politicians that

00:30:54.412 --> 00:30:56.121 align:middle line:90%
are in charge of the game.

00:30:56.121 --> 00:31:00.459 align:middle line:84%
And so, the average person is
having a more difficult time

00:31:00.459 --> 00:31:02.961 align:middle line:84%
paying the bills, they're
getting angrier and angrier.

00:31:02.961 --> 00:31:05.625 align:middle line:84%
You see it more so
in the other nations.

00:31:05.625 --> 00:31:07.333 align:middle line:84%
I'm talking about
the-- >> Regina: Right.

00:31:07.333 --> 00:31:08.934 align:middle line:84%
>> Hoffman: -- Fragile
Five-- >> Regina: Right.

00:31:08.934 --> 00:31:09.935 align:middle line:84%
>> Hoffman: -- and more
third world nations,

00:31:09.935 --> 00:31:12.873 align:middle line:84%
but you're also starting to see
it in First World nations per

00:31:12.873 --> 00:31:13.372 align:middle line:90%
se.

00:31:13.372 --> 00:31:14.473 align:middle line:90%
>> Regina: Yes.

00:31:14.473 --> 00:31:16.473 align:middle line:84%
>> Hoffman: I mean, Greece
is a perfect example.

00:31:16.473 --> 00:31:18.844 align:middle line:84%
I think if they had
a new election today,

00:31:18.844 --> 00:31:21.200 align:middle line:84%
I think that New Dawn
Party-- the Nazi Party

00:31:21.200 --> 00:31:23.756 align:middle line:84%
would probably get a huge
percentage of the votes.

00:31:23.756 --> 00:31:25.506 align:middle line:84%
People are getting
very angry-- and around

00:31:25.506 --> 00:31:27.089 align:middle line:84%
the country here in
the United States.

00:31:27.089 --> 00:31:30.471 align:middle line:84%
I mean, I just saw today that
now almost every retailer

00:31:30.471 --> 00:31:33.525 align:middle line:84%
is going to be open on
all day on Thanksgiving.

00:31:33.525 --> 00:31:35.635 align:middle line:84%
K-Mart is opening at
6 AM-- >> Regina: Yes.

00:31:35.635 --> 00:31:37.968 align:middle line:84%
>> Hoffman: -- because business
is so bad that they just

00:31:37.968 --> 00:31:38.468 align:middle line:90%
don't care.

00:31:38.468 --> 00:31:40.766 align:middle line:84%
I mean people have to
work for minimum wage.

00:31:40.766 --> 00:31:42.267 align:middle line:90%
They're lucky if they can do it.

00:31:42.267 --> 00:31:44.269 align:middle line:84%
These are the kind of
things that are going on.

00:31:44.269 --> 00:31:45.704 align:middle line:90%
People are getting mad.

00:31:45.704 --> 00:31:48.607 align:middle line:84%
I remember, these food
stamps, and these disability

00:31:48.607 --> 00:31:52.396 align:middle line:84%
and these entitlements which
now are given to more than half

00:31:52.396 --> 00:31:53.579 align:middle line:90%
of all Americans.

00:31:53.579 --> 00:31:57.835 align:middle line:84%
They are dependent on
inflation not getting

00:31:57.835 --> 00:32:00.147 align:middle line:84%
worse because--
in fact they just

00:32:00.147 --> 00:32:02.621 align:middle line:84%
cut-- that's one of the
few things they cut.

00:32:02.621 --> 00:32:05.624 align:middle line:84%
They just cut food
stamps by six percent

00:32:05.624 --> 00:32:07.426 align:middle line:90%
in the latest budget thing.

00:32:07.426 --> 00:32:09.395 align:middle line:84%
That's pretty much the
only thing they cut.

00:32:09.395 --> 00:32:12.457 align:middle line:84%
And so, what you're seeing
now is the standard of living

00:32:12.457 --> 00:32:14.067 align:middle line:84%
is going down and
people are getting

00:32:14.067 --> 00:32:17.336 align:middle line:84%
more and more upset and angry
except for the one percent

00:32:17.336 --> 00:32:18.670 align:middle line:90%
who are getting richer.

00:32:18.670 --> 00:32:20.819 align:middle line:84%
And, you know, at
some point it's

00:32:20.819 --> 00:32:24.080 align:middle line:84%
going to fester in this
nation as it's been

00:32:24.080 --> 00:32:25.644 align:middle line:90%
festering around the world.

00:32:25.644 --> 00:32:29.248 align:middle line:84%
>> Regina: So, amidst all of
this, what's the IMF all about?

00:32:29.248 --> 00:32:30.449 align:middle line:90%
What are they doing?

00:32:30.449 --> 00:32:33.485 align:middle line:84%
And there's something called
Special Drawing Rights.

00:32:33.485 --> 00:32:35.754 align:middle line:90%
What does that mean?

00:32:35.754 --> 00:32:40.759 align:middle line:84%
>> Hoffman: Well, the IMF is
a very nefarious organization.

00:32:40.759 --> 00:32:44.863 align:middle line:84%
It's basically-- I'm not into
this new world order thing

00:32:44.863 --> 00:32:47.566 align:middle line:84%
where - but it's
basically leader--

00:32:47.566 --> 00:32:52.004 align:middle line:84%
elite leaders of the leading
nations have created this

00:32:52.004 --> 00:32:55.988 align:middle line:84%
organization that bullies other
nations about what they should

00:32:55.988 --> 00:32:57.242 align:middle line:90%
do with their finances.

00:32:57.242 --> 00:33:00.112 align:middle line:84%
They supposedly have their
own reserves and gold

00:33:00.112 --> 00:33:02.002 align:middle line:84%
but they really
don't, they really

00:33:02.002 --> 00:33:04.512 align:middle line:84%
are just drawing on
gold that other people

00:33:04.512 --> 00:33:06.685 align:middle line:90%
own which may or may not exist.

00:33:06.685 --> 00:33:08.589 align:middle line:84%
So they're pretty much
a hollow organization

00:33:08.589 --> 00:33:12.324 align:middle line:84%
but they have a lot of power
in the things that they say.

00:33:12.324 --> 00:33:15.294 align:middle line:84%
When they say-- when
there's a bailout going on

00:33:15.294 --> 00:33:17.865 align:middle line:84%
in Greece for instance,
they're at the table

00:33:17.865 --> 00:33:19.865 align:middle line:84%
saying, "You have to do
this." >> Regina: Right.

00:33:19.865 --> 00:33:21.646 align:middle line:84%
I mean-- >> Hoffman:
It's on-- >> Regina: --

00:33:21.646 --> 00:33:21.934 align:middle line:90%
who are these people?

00:33:21.934 --> 00:33:22.868 align:middle line:90%
>> Hoffman: Yes.

00:33:22.868 --> 00:33:24.326 align:middle line:84%
They're just a
bunch of bureaucrats

00:33:24.326 --> 00:33:25.904 align:middle line:90%
that are in high positions.

00:33:25.904 --> 00:33:28.974 align:middle line:84%
And then, you know, they
are not a rich organization

00:33:28.974 --> 00:33:31.076 align:middle line:84%
but they are powerful
and they're always--

00:33:31.076 --> 00:33:33.812 align:middle line:84%
and if you'd see the
decrees that they're doing,

00:33:33.812 --> 00:33:36.260 align:middle line:84%
they are constantly
agreeing with anything

00:33:36.260 --> 00:33:42.034 align:middle line:84%
that relates to suppression
of the individual for the one

00:33:42.034 --> 00:33:42.654 align:middle line:90%
percent.

00:33:42.654 --> 00:33:46.558 align:middle line:84%
And, you know, when you talk
about special drawing rights.

00:33:46.558 --> 00:33:48.627 align:middle line:90%
That's just a silly thing.

00:33:48.627 --> 00:33:50.996 align:middle line:84%
It's-- that isn't--
they're even past it now.

00:33:50.996 --> 00:33:53.496 align:middle line:84%
It's one of these things-- well,
instead of the U.S. dollar,

00:33:53.496 --> 00:33:55.901 align:middle line:84%
why don't we create a
basket of fiat currencies

00:33:55.901 --> 00:33:57.503 align:middle line:84%
to be the world
reserved currency,

00:33:57.503 --> 00:33:59.238 align:middle line:84%
but it has the same
problems as a dollar.

00:33:59.238 --> 00:34:02.342 align:middle line:84%
It's based on nothing, plus
it has even weaker currencies

00:34:02.342 --> 00:34:03.008 align:middle line:90%
than the dollar.

00:34:03.008 --> 00:34:03.675 align:middle line:90%
>> Regina: Yeah.

00:34:03.675 --> 00:34:05.883 align:middle line:84%
>> Hoffman: So the fact is
you're always going to see

00:34:05.883 --> 00:34:08.846 align:middle line:84%
the-- as I call them, the powers
that be trying to kick the can

00:34:08.846 --> 00:34:13.218 align:middle line:84%
with new schemes whether it's
the, you know, these bailouts,

00:34:13.218 --> 00:34:17.389 align:middle line:84%
these bail ins of which the
IMF is very supportive of.

00:34:17.389 --> 00:34:20.025 align:middle line:84%
You know, tarp, you name
it-- nationalizations.

00:34:20.025 --> 00:34:23.261 align:middle line:84%
They're always there with
their evil hands in the pie.

00:34:23.261 --> 00:34:25.214 align:middle line:84%
And as things get
worse, you're going

00:34:25.214 --> 00:34:28.615 align:middle line:84%
to see more people like
them making decisions

00:34:28.615 --> 00:34:31.470 align:middle line:84%
until eventually
the people revolt.

00:34:31.470 --> 00:34:32.371 align:middle line:90%
>> Regina: OK.

00:34:32.371 --> 00:34:34.072 align:middle line:84%
Let's talk about
other currencies.

00:34:34.072 --> 00:34:36.441 align:middle line:84%
We already talked
about the Fragile Five.

00:34:36.441 --> 00:34:38.410 align:middle line:84%
Let's talk about some
that are so fragile,

00:34:38.410 --> 00:34:40.312 align:middle line:84%
they were virtually
non existent.

00:34:40.312 --> 00:34:43.181 align:middle line:84%
And I referred to this in
the opening of this show

00:34:43.181 --> 00:34:45.984 align:middle line:84%
that they're the two most
notable ones that people--

00:34:45.984 --> 00:34:47.881 align:middle line:84%
they're boards all
over the world, people

00:34:47.881 --> 00:34:51.422 align:middle line:84%
talking about the Iraqi
dinar, the Vietnamese dong,

00:34:51.422 --> 00:34:56.844 align:middle line:84%
and other currencies, that there
is a global reset of currencies

00:34:56.844 --> 00:34:58.697 align:middle line:84%
that's getting ready
to occur starting

00:34:58.697 --> 00:35:01.899 align:middle line:84%
with a few of the most
fragile, beaten up once

00:35:01.899 --> 00:35:03.201 align:middle line:90%
and moving upward.

00:35:03.201 --> 00:35:06.705 align:middle line:84%
What do you know about that
and how does Basel 3 come in?

00:35:06.705 --> 00:35:08.881 align:middle line:84%
How does the Bank of
International Settlements

00:35:08.881 --> 00:35:10.509 align:middle line:90%
figure into all of these?

00:35:10.509 --> 00:35:12.177 align:middle line:84%
>> Hoffman: Well,
a lot of question.

00:35:12.177 --> 00:35:15.948 align:middle line:84%
Well, when a currency
like the Iraqi dinar,

00:35:15.948 --> 00:35:18.684 align:middle line:84%
it was so brutally beaten
up because of the war.

00:35:18.684 --> 00:35:19.851 align:middle line:90%
>> Regina: Right.

00:35:19.851 --> 00:35:20.852 align:middle line:84%
>> Hoffman: Funny thing is
I believe in recent years,

00:35:20.852 --> 00:35:23.069 align:middle line:84%
it's actually gone up against
the dollar which should tell

00:35:23.069 --> 00:35:24.623 align:middle line:84%
you how weak-- >>
Regina: That's bad.

00:35:24.623 --> 00:35:25.791 align:middle line:84%
>> Hoffman: -- it
is for the dollar.

00:35:25.791 --> 00:35:28.394 align:middle line:84%
>> Regina: It was worth like a
portion of a cent-- >> Hoffman:

00:35:28.394 --> 00:35:28.894 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:35:28.894 --> 00:35:29.895 align:middle line:90%
>> Regina: -- you know.

00:35:29.895 --> 00:35:32.108 align:middle line:84%
>> Hoffman: I put out an article
may be two or three months ago

00:35:32.108 --> 00:35:34.600 align:middle line:84%
called "The Most Important
Article I've Ever Written"

00:35:34.600 --> 00:35:37.402 align:middle line:84%
because I was just looking at
the Fragile Five currencies

00:35:37.402 --> 00:35:39.638 align:middle line:84%
to see what was
going on with them.

00:35:39.638 --> 00:35:41.834 align:middle line:84%
But then I said, why don't
I look at all of them,

00:35:41.834 --> 00:35:44.676 align:middle line:84%
you know, from population
down just to see.

00:35:44.676 --> 00:35:45.438 align:middle line:90%
>> Regina: Right.

00:35:45.438 --> 00:35:47.479 align:middle line:84%
>> Hoffman: And it turns
out that with the U.S.--

00:35:47.479 --> 00:35:50.882 align:middle line:84%
with the fed printing more money
than it's ever printed before,

00:35:50.882 --> 00:35:53.418 align:middle line:84%
the dollar, excuse me, has
gone up against every currency

00:35:53.418 --> 00:35:59.157 align:middle line:84%
in the last two years on average
by 20 or 25 percent except

00:35:59.157 --> 00:36:03.395 align:middle line:84%
for I think the-- like the
Kenyan-- [Laughter ] --

00:36:03.395 --> 00:36:04.029 align:middle line:90%
something.

00:36:04.029 --> 00:36:06.320 align:middle line:84%
It was like a couple of
percentage actually down again.

00:36:06.320 --> 00:36:09.129 align:middle line:84%
The point is, the dollar-- the
fed has exported this inflation

00:36:09.129 --> 00:36:10.371 align:middle line:90%
explosively around the word.

00:36:10.371 --> 00:36:12.787 align:middle line:84%
And now they're-- that I believe
they're going to increase

00:36:12.787 --> 00:36:13.287 align:middle line:90%
the QE.

00:36:13.287 --> 00:36:14.706 align:middle line:90%
It's only going to get worse.

00:36:14.706 --> 00:36:19.068 align:middle line:84%
If you talk about
global resets and you

00:36:19.068 --> 00:36:21.298 align:middle line:84%
were saying potential
windfalls, there's

00:36:21.298 --> 00:36:23.715 align:middle line:84%
going to be no
windfalls for anyone.

00:36:23.715 --> 00:36:25.785 align:middle line:84%
I think if you own
physical gold and silver,

00:36:25.785 --> 00:36:27.916 align:middle line:84%
you're going to be
insured against that

00:36:27.916 --> 00:36:31.696 align:middle line:84%
but it's going to be a very
difficult road between now

00:36:31.696 --> 00:36:32.391 align:middle line:90%
and then.

00:36:32.391 --> 00:36:34.281 align:middle line:84%
No matter what
happens, any windfalls

00:36:34.281 --> 00:36:36.995 align:middle line:84%
are going to be offset
by the social unrest

00:36:36.995 --> 00:36:39.197 align:middle line:84%
by the Draconian
government decrees.

00:36:39.197 --> 00:36:42.901 align:middle line:84%
Your goal should simply
be to protect your assets

00:36:42.901 --> 00:36:46.945 align:middle line:84%
through this transition to a new
global reserve currency which

00:36:46.945 --> 00:36:48.607 align:middle line:84%
will be backed by
gold and, you know,

00:36:48.607 --> 00:36:50.509 align:middle line:84%
maybe the process
starts next year.

00:36:50.509 --> 00:36:52.449 align:middle line:84%
May be it starts in
five years but it's not

00:36:52.449 --> 00:36:55.414 align:middle line:84%
going to be generations
from now, that's for sure.

00:36:55.414 --> 00:36:57.716 align:middle line:84%
Because, as I said, it's
a Ponzi scheme that's

00:36:57.716 --> 00:37:00.852 align:middle line:84%
in its final stages, when
the debt starts-- first,

00:37:00.852 --> 00:37:03.025 align:middle line:84%
it goes out arithmetically
then geometrically,

00:37:03.025 --> 00:37:07.059 align:middle line:84%
and now it's in the phase where
it's about to go parabolically.

00:37:07.059 --> 00:37:08.293 align:middle line:90%
>> Regina: OK.

00:37:08.293 --> 00:37:09.961 align:middle line:90%
What about derivatives?

00:37:09.961 --> 00:37:11.537 align:middle line:84%
You know, a lot of
the problems here

00:37:11.537 --> 00:37:13.120 align:middle line:84%
started with the
notion of derivatives

00:37:13.120 --> 00:37:15.934 align:middle line:84%
which most people can't even
explain what a derivative is.

00:37:15.934 --> 00:37:18.860 align:middle line:84%
But does that
vehicle-- that-- do you

00:37:18.860 --> 00:37:22.240 align:middle line:84%
call it an instrument
to financial product

00:37:22.240 --> 00:37:23.375 align:middle line:90%
or instrument?

00:37:23.375 --> 00:37:25.971 align:middle line:84%
Should that even exist anymore
if we knew what it was?

00:37:25.971 --> 00:37:27.679 align:middle line:84%
>> Hoffman: Well, it's
too late for that.

00:37:27.679 --> 00:37:29.114 align:middle line:84%
>> Regina: I mean--
>> Hoffman: Yes.

00:37:29.114 --> 00:37:30.682 align:middle line:84%
I mean, it's funny
'cause Warren Buffett,

00:37:30.682 --> 00:37:32.684 align:middle line:84%
who I despise more than
anyone in the planet,

00:37:32.684 --> 00:37:34.653 align:middle line:90%
he's the chief sell out.

00:37:34.653 --> 00:37:36.535 align:middle line:84%
He's one of the few
people who could

00:37:36.535 --> 00:37:37.910 align:middle line:84%
have made a
difference especially

00:37:37.910 --> 00:37:41.526 align:middle line:84%
given who his father was--
one of the original gold bugs.

00:37:41.526 --> 00:37:43.161 align:middle line:84%
You know, he called
derivatives weapons

00:37:43.161 --> 00:37:44.761 align:middle line:84%
of mass financial
destruction which

00:37:44.761 --> 00:37:46.365 align:middle line:90%
is exactly what they were.

00:37:46.365 --> 00:37:48.891 align:middle line:84%
They compounded all
the bad practices

00:37:48.891 --> 00:37:52.654 align:middle line:84%
that led to the 2008
crash, and now they

00:37:52.654 --> 00:37:55.707 align:middle line:84%
are again, a Ponzi scheme
in that they must be there.

00:37:55.707 --> 00:37:57.361 align:middle line:90%
You can't take them out.

00:37:57.361 --> 00:37:59.611 align:middle line:84%
They are-- >> Regina: So
they're going to continue on?

00:37:59.611 --> 00:38:01.777 align:middle line:84%
>> Hoffman: They are an
integral part of the system,

00:38:01.777 --> 00:38:05.050 align:middle line:84%
a cancer that's lurking
under the table, you know,

00:38:05.050 --> 00:38:07.770 align:middle line:84%
holding it up but it's
going to eventually,

00:38:07.770 --> 00:38:10.455 align:middle line:84%
and metastasize and
destroy the economy.

00:38:10.455 --> 00:38:12.915 align:middle line:84%
The fact is that it
all-- that all goes back

00:38:12.915 --> 00:38:14.693 align:middle line:84%
to the repeal of the
Glass-Steagall Act.

00:38:14.693 --> 00:38:15.544 align:middle line:90%
>> Regina: Right.

00:38:15.544 --> 00:38:17.335 align:middle line:84%
>> Hoffman: We talked
about this last time,

00:38:17.335 --> 00:38:20.065 align:middle line:84%
back in 1999 which allowed--
basically allowed the banks

00:38:20.065 --> 00:38:21.199 align:middle line:90%
to do whatever they want.

00:38:21.199 --> 00:38:24.970 align:middle line:84%
And when they had--
it was at that time

00:38:24.970 --> 00:38:29.608 align:middle line:84%
when they were mastering the
financial engineering products

00:38:29.608 --> 00:38:31.376 align:middle line:84%
where they can mix
in the computers

00:38:31.376 --> 00:38:33.612 align:middle line:84%
into the real
world of economics.

00:38:33.612 --> 00:38:34.382 align:middle line:90%
>> Regina: Right.

00:38:34.382 --> 00:38:36.548 align:middle line:84%
>> Hoffman: And they've
latched on and destroyed it.

00:38:36.548 --> 00:38:39.605 align:middle line:84%
So everything that
happens in the markets

00:38:39.605 --> 00:38:41.586 align:middle line:84%
is compounded by
these derivatives.

00:38:41.586 --> 00:38:44.156 align:middle line:84%
And when the markets
eventually crash, you know.

00:38:44.156 --> 00:38:47.025 align:middle line:84%
What you saw on 2008, where
the derivatives compounded it,

00:38:47.025 --> 00:38:49.274 align:middle line:84%
it will be a lot
worse this time around

00:38:49.274 --> 00:38:50.762 align:middle line:84%
because the system
is more fragile

00:38:50.762 --> 00:38:52.531 align:middle line:90%
and there's more derivatives.

00:38:52.531 --> 00:38:54.232 align:middle line:90%
>> Regina: OK.

00:38:54.232 --> 00:38:57.335 align:middle line:84%
Chase, there were headlines
about Chase-- Chase Manhattan,

00:38:57.335 --> 00:38:59.183 align:middle line:84%
that they were
limiting the amount

00:38:59.183 --> 00:39:00.872 align:middle line:90%
a depositor could withdraw.

00:39:00.872 --> 00:39:01.807 align:middle line:90%
>> Hoffman: Right.

00:39:01.807 --> 00:39:02.474 align:middle line:84%
>> Regina: What's
the truth on that?

00:39:02.474 --> 00:39:03.432 align:middle line:90%
What's really going on?

00:39:03.432 --> 00:39:04.409 align:middle line:90%
>> Hoffman: Right.

00:39:04.409 --> 00:39:05.710 align:middle line:84%
Well, J.P. Morgan-- when
you say J.P. Morgan,

00:39:05.710 --> 00:39:06.778 align:middle line:90%
they are the government.

00:39:06.778 --> 00:39:08.486 align:middle line:84%
They-- you know, some
people say, " Well,

00:39:08.486 --> 00:39:09.581 align:middle line:90%
what are the banks doing?"

00:39:09.581 --> 00:39:10.080 align:middle line:90%
No.

00:39:10.080 --> 00:39:13.117 align:middle line:84%
J.P. Morgan has been
the government's bank

00:39:13.117 --> 00:39:14.452 align:middle line:90%
for some time.

00:39:14.452 --> 00:39:16.888 align:middle line:84%
You could say the same for
other banks like Goldman Sachs,

00:39:16.888 --> 00:39:19.126 align:middle line:84%
just look at all of the
appointments around the world

00:39:19.126 --> 00:39:20.292 align:middle line:90%
for-- >> Regina: Absolutely.

00:39:20.292 --> 00:39:23.028 align:middle line:84%
>> Hoffman: -- leading positions
in governments and central

00:39:23.028 --> 00:39:23.528 align:middle line:90%
banks.

00:39:23.528 --> 00:39:26.198 align:middle line:84%
But J.P. Morgan is
by far the largest.

00:39:26.198 --> 00:39:29.201 align:middle line:84%
And so, what they do
and you see every day

00:39:29.201 --> 00:39:32.340 align:middle line:84%
a new scandal with them
and a new settlement,

00:39:32.340 --> 00:39:33.171 align:middle line:90%
but they're immune.

00:39:33.171 --> 00:39:36.475 align:middle line:84%
They are too big to fail because
the government backs them.

00:39:36.475 --> 00:39:38.239 align:middle line:84%
What you're referring
to is just recently

00:39:38.239 --> 00:39:40.579 align:middle line:84%
they sent out letters
to-- >> Regina: Yes.

00:39:40.579 --> 00:39:42.997 align:middle line:84%
>> Hoffman: -- thousands of
clients saying as of November

00:39:42.997 --> 00:39:47.219 align:middle line:84%
13th, or something, you can no
longer send international wires

00:39:47.219 --> 00:39:48.954 align:middle line:84%
which is a form of
capital control.

00:39:48.954 --> 00:39:50.155 align:middle line:90%
>> Regina: Right.

00:39:50.155 --> 00:39:52.524 align:middle line:84%
>> Hoffman: And believe me,
if J.P. Morgan is doing it,

00:39:52.524 --> 00:39:55.093 align:middle line:84%
it's the government
that's behind that.

00:39:55.093 --> 00:39:59.965 align:middle line:84%
Now, there's been some question
about that particular instance

00:39:59.965 --> 00:40:03.535 align:middle line:84%
because I've seen articles
refuting it, not by J.P Morgan.

00:40:03.535 --> 00:40:05.453 align:middle line:84%
They haven't said
one thing but I've

00:40:05.453 --> 00:40:07.404 align:middle line:84%
seen business--
Forbes say, "No, it's

00:40:07.404 --> 00:40:09.508 align:middle line:84%
really only for
certain small accounts.

00:40:09.508 --> 00:40:11.162 align:middle line:84%
They can upgrade
to big accounts,"

00:40:11.162 --> 00:40:13.078 align:middle line:84%
but the fact is those
letters didn't say that.

00:40:13.078 --> 00:40:15.247 align:middle line:84%
And I haven't seen
anything that refutes that.

00:40:15.247 --> 00:40:17.583 align:middle line:84%
So it's still in
question but the fact

00:40:17.583 --> 00:40:19.479 align:middle line:84%
is, we at Miles
Franklin, we've been

00:40:19.479 --> 00:40:21.897 align:middle line:84%
talking about capital
controls for some time.

00:40:21.897 --> 00:40:23.688 align:middle line:84%
There's a-- just look
at the United States,

00:40:23.688 --> 00:40:26.591 align:middle line:84%
they have these two rules
that just came out a year

00:40:26.591 --> 00:40:31.169 align:middle line:84%
or two ago called FATCA
and FBAR, Foreign Account

00:40:31.169 --> 00:40:34.199 align:middle line:84%
Compliance Act and
one is Foreign--

00:40:34.199 --> 00:40:35.903 align:middle line:90%
I forgot what the FBAR is.

00:40:35.903 --> 00:40:38.069 align:middle line:84%
Basically, they want the
people to report everything

00:40:38.069 --> 00:40:39.838 align:middle line:84%
that they have
outside of the country

00:40:39.838 --> 00:40:41.976 align:middle line:84%
and they want other banks
and other countries,

00:40:41.976 --> 00:40:43.975 align:middle line:84%
other governments to--
>> Regina: To rat on you.

00:40:43.975 --> 00:40:44.476 align:middle line:90%
>> Hoffman: -- to conspire.

00:40:44.476 --> 00:40:45.142 align:middle line:90%
>> Regina: Yeah.

00:40:45.142 --> 00:40:45.977 align:middle line:90%
Exactly.

00:40:45.977 --> 00:40:47.451 align:middle line:84%
>> Hoffman: And so, you're
seeing a lot of blowback from

00:40:47.451 --> 00:40:49.848 align:middle line:84%
that, but the fact is these
are all capital controls.

00:40:49.848 --> 00:40:53.812 align:middle line:84%
And people forget what happened
in 2008, 2009 at-- you know,

00:40:53.812 --> 00:40:55.353 align:middle line:84%
when things are
really falling apart.

00:40:55.353 --> 00:40:58.089 align:middle line:84%
The banks were not allowing
people to take money out,

00:40:58.089 --> 00:41:00.157 align:middle line:84%
they were limiting withdrawals,
they were limiting-- >> Regina:

00:41:00.157 --> 00:41:01.393 align:middle line:84%
Like a couple thousand or
something-- it was-- yeah.

00:41:01.393 --> 00:41:02.360 align:middle line:90%
>> Hoffman: Yeah.

00:41:02.360 --> 00:41:04.195 align:middle line:84%
The government was
also negotiating--

00:41:04.195 --> 00:41:07.832 align:middle line:84%
Congress was debating
confiscating IRAs back then

00:41:07.832 --> 00:41:09.567 align:middle line:90%
which they will eventually do.

00:41:09.567 --> 00:41:11.541 align:middle line:84%
So as things get
worse, you're going

00:41:11.541 --> 00:41:13.747 align:middle line:84%
to see capital controls
which by the way

00:41:13.747 --> 00:41:15.640 align:middle line:90%
are going on all over the world.

00:41:15.640 --> 00:41:18.176 align:middle line:84%
I mean Cyprus is the
perfect example of that.

00:41:18.176 --> 00:41:18.885 align:middle line:90%
>> Regina: Right.

00:41:18.885 --> 00:41:21.300 align:middle line:84%
>> Hoffman: But it's been going
around - around the world,

00:41:21.300 --> 00:41:23.248 align:middle line:84%
even Argentina right
now, Venezuela.

00:41:23.248 --> 00:41:25.250 align:middle line:90%
It's spreading in Latin America.

00:41:25.250 --> 00:41:28.019 align:middle line:84%
So you'll see more of that
what's going on at J.P. Morgan?

00:41:28.019 --> 00:41:29.854 align:middle line:84%
It's unclear at the
moment but believe me,

00:41:29.854 --> 00:41:31.957 align:middle line:84%
where there's
smoke, there's fire.

00:41:31.957 --> 00:41:37.329 align:middle line:84%
>> Regina: Let's talk about now,
Obamacare which-- >> Hoffman:

00:41:37.329 --> 00:41:37.829 align:middle line:90%
Right.

00:41:37.829 --> 00:41:39.731 align:middle line:84%
>> Regina: -- is not
sounding too good.

00:41:39.731 --> 00:41:42.314 align:middle line:84%
I'm-- in fact next week, I'll
be doing an interview with an MD

00:41:42.314 --> 00:41:45.903 align:middle line:84%
and he started digging into
fine print and is absolutely

00:41:45.903 --> 00:41:49.341 align:middle line:84%
appalled at what Obamacare is
going to bring upon our heads.

00:41:49.341 --> 00:41:51.943 align:middle line:84%
So what do you say from a
financial point of view?

00:41:51.943 --> 00:41:55.697 align:middle line:84%
>> Hoffman: Well, as I said,
more than half of the nation is

00:41:55.697 --> 00:41:59.169 align:middle line:84%
now on entitlements, and
as the situation gets worse

00:41:59.169 --> 00:42:01.720 align:middle line:84%
for the economy, you're
going to see more of that.

00:42:01.720 --> 00:42:05.256 align:middle line:84%
That's why the Democrats are
doing so well in elections

00:42:05.256 --> 00:42:07.092 align:middle line:90%
because they promised more.

00:42:07.092 --> 00:42:09.227 align:middle line:84%
There's no-- the Republicans
are not doing well

00:42:09.227 --> 00:42:12.030 align:middle line:84%
because they have typically
been the rich party

00:42:12.030 --> 00:42:13.598 align:middle line:90%
but people aren't rich anymore.

00:42:13.598 --> 00:42:15.934 align:middle line:84%
We now have what's called
the Dependency Nation

00:42:15.934 --> 00:42:18.440 align:middle line:84%
and what better
way to foster that

00:42:18.440 --> 00:42:20.739 align:middle line:90%
than through this Obamacare.

00:42:20.739 --> 00:42:23.461 align:middle line:84%
This-- I mean-- all of the other
socialist nations in the world

00:42:23.461 --> 00:42:25.210 align:middle line:84%
have it, so why
shouldn't we have it?

00:42:25.210 --> 00:42:27.078 align:middle line:90%
It's a perfect way to get votes.

00:42:27.078 --> 00:42:29.114 align:middle line:90%
You know, damn the consequences.

00:42:29.114 --> 00:42:32.083 align:middle line:84%
Now, to anyone who's
watching this realizes,

00:42:32.083 --> 00:42:35.820 align:middle line:84%
I think it's 20,000
pages, 50,000 pages.

00:42:35.820 --> 00:42:37.660 align:middle line:84%
The people who voted
on it didn't even

00:42:37.660 --> 00:42:39.612 align:middle line:84%
read it and-- >> Regina:
Doctors are having a hard time

00:42:39.612 --> 00:42:40.986 align:middle line:84%
even knowing how
to interpret it.

00:42:40.986 --> 00:42:42.127 align:middle line:90%
>> Hoffman: Exactly.

00:42:42.127 --> 00:42:46.031 align:middle line:84%
And it's a colossal mess
which has a major cost to it.

00:42:46.031 --> 00:42:48.533 align:middle line:84%
Even the Government
Accounting Office--

00:42:48.533 --> 00:42:53.104 align:middle line:84%
the GAO has said that it's going
to cost hundreds of billions

00:42:53.104 --> 00:42:56.637 align:middle line:84%
of dollars, if not trillions,
while Obama is saying it's

00:42:56.637 --> 00:42:57.876 align:middle line:90%
going to pay for itself.

00:42:57.876 --> 00:42:59.377 align:middle line:90%
No, it's not paying for itself.

00:42:59.377 --> 00:43:01.337 align:middle line:84%
There are-- the
amount of direct costs

00:43:01.337 --> 00:43:03.895 align:middle line:84%
alone are in a hundreds of
billions, indirect costs

00:43:03.895 --> 00:43:06.567 align:middle line:84%
as you talked about,
you know, the doctors

00:43:06.567 --> 00:43:11.526 align:middle line:84%
exiting the system, the employee
mandate which they just put off

00:43:11.526 --> 00:43:14.346 align:middle line:84%
from January 1st to
January 1st next year

00:43:14.346 --> 00:43:15.838 align:middle line:84%
conveniently after
the elections,

00:43:15.838 --> 00:43:19.160 align:middle line:84%
is forcing employers to get
rid of full time employees

00:43:19.160 --> 00:43:22.252 align:middle line:84%
so that they don't have
to utilize Obamacare.

00:43:22.252 --> 00:43:23.710 align:middle line:84%
And that's going
to only contribute

00:43:23.710 --> 00:43:26.377 align:middle line:84%
to what we talked about
in the labor participation

00:43:26.377 --> 00:43:27.505 align:middle line:90%
rate going forward.

00:43:27.505 --> 00:43:29.884 align:middle line:84%
So, the way I see it and
have seen it for some time

00:43:29.884 --> 00:43:32.666 align:middle line:84%
is that this is one of the
most destructive pieces

00:43:32.666 --> 00:43:36.748 align:middle line:84%
of legislation in U.S. history
and just in the simplest form.

00:43:36.748 --> 00:43:41.286 align:middle line:84%
Forget the rationing of medical
costs are going to surge.

00:43:41.286 --> 00:43:42.766 align:middle line:84%
I mean what you're
going to see is

00:43:42.766 --> 00:43:44.932 align:middle line:84%
if we're going to be the
socialist states of America

00:43:44.932 --> 00:43:46.624 align:middle line:84%
which clearly we're
going to be, we're

00:43:46.624 --> 00:43:48.827 align:middle line:84%
going to have
socialist tax rates.

00:43:48.827 --> 00:43:51.532 align:middle line:84%
So I think everyone should
prepare for a 50 percent

00:43:51.532 --> 00:43:54.071 align:middle line:84%
federal tax rate, just
like to have in Europe,

00:43:54.071 --> 00:43:56.801 align:middle line:84%
like they have in Canada,
and getting much higher

00:43:56.801 --> 00:44:00.105 align:middle line:90%
for wealthier Americans.

00:44:00.105 --> 00:44:02.794 align:middle line:84%
>> Regina: I don't think unless
a person is well traveled from

00:44:02.794 --> 00:44:06.527 align:middle line:84%
the United States out--
people do not understand what

00:44:06.527 --> 00:44:09.581 align:middle line:84%
the quality of life level has
been here compared in living

00:44:09.581 --> 00:44:11.483 align:middle line:90%
in almost any other nation.

00:44:11.483 --> 00:44:15.814 align:middle line:84%
>> Hoffman: I just read a piece
this week that showed readings

00:44:15.814 --> 00:44:17.689 align:middle line:84%
for different countries
for their healthcare.

00:44:17.689 --> 00:44:18.823 align:middle line:90%
>> Regina: Yeah.

00:44:18.823 --> 00:44:20.948 align:middle line:84%
>> Hoffman: And the United
States rated the highest

00:44:20.948 --> 00:44:25.230 align:middle line:84%
in the quality of care in the
amount of time that it takes

00:44:25.230 --> 00:44:27.298 align:middle line:84%
to get that care, meaning
you get it quicker.

00:44:27.298 --> 00:44:28.533 align:middle line:90%
All those things.

00:44:28.533 --> 00:44:31.053 align:middle line:84%
So guess what, we're
going to now, get rid

00:44:31.053 --> 00:44:32.748 align:middle line:90%
of all that-- >> Regina: Yes.

00:44:32.748 --> 00:44:35.373 align:middle line:84%
>> Hoffman: -- and move down to
that standard-- >> Regina: Yes.

00:44:35.373 --> 00:44:36.674 align:middle line:84%
>> Hoffman: -- in
other countries.

00:44:36.674 --> 00:44:38.051 align:middle line:84%
And as a result, it's
going to cause chaos

00:44:38.051 --> 00:44:39.611 align:middle line:84%
when people came to can't
get the care they need.

00:44:39.611 --> 00:44:40.945 align:middle line:84%
>> Regina: Well, chaos
is are already occurring

00:44:40.945 --> 00:44:43.281 align:middle line:84%
because they're bumping people
off by the thousands a day off

00:44:43.281 --> 00:44:44.315 align:middle line:90%
of their current plans.

00:44:44.315 --> 00:44:47.919 align:middle line:84%
It's said in the big
bold print, no problem,

00:44:47.919 --> 00:44:50.255 align:middle line:84%
you can keep you rcurrent
plan if you wish,

00:44:50.255 --> 00:44:52.390 align:middle line:90%
or you can have our Obamacare.

00:44:52.390 --> 00:44:53.410 align:middle line:90%
That's a lie.

00:44:53.410 --> 00:44:55.409 align:middle line:84%
People are being bumped
off and my understanding

00:44:55.409 --> 00:44:57.629 align:middle line:84%
is most of us are going to be
bumped by the time it's over.

00:44:57.629 --> 00:45:00.231 align:middle line:84%
>> Hoffman: This is another one
of those things about Obamacare

00:45:00.231 --> 00:45:02.021 align:middle line:84%
which no one was aware
about until-- >> Regina:

00:45:02.021 --> 00:45:02.467 align:middle line:90%
No one was aware.

00:45:02.467 --> 00:45:03.168 align:middle line:90%
>> Hoffman: -- last week.

00:45:03.168 --> 00:45:04.335 align:middle line:90%
>> Regina: Last week.

00:45:04.335 --> 00:45:06.418 align:middle line:84%
And now, it's like 2 million
have already lost it.

00:45:06.418 --> 00:45:08.616 align:middle line:84%
People every day, people
we know-- >> Hoffman: Yeah.

00:45:08.616 --> 00:45:10.824 align:middle line:84%
>> Regina: -- are getting
notices that they have been

00:45:10.824 --> 00:45:12.282 align:middle line:84%
removed from their
healthcare plan.

00:45:12.282 --> 00:45:15.346 align:middle line:84%
And in addition to that,
it's becoming clear

00:45:15.346 --> 00:45:18.149 align:middle line:84%
that the deductibles are
going to sky rocket--

00:45:18.149 --> 00:45:21.953 align:middle line:84%
go from 6,000 to 13,000 on
some plans-- >> Hoffman: Yes.

00:45:21.953 --> 00:45:23.121 align:middle line:90%
>> Regina: -- for example.

00:45:23.121 --> 00:45:25.287 align:middle line:84%
>> Hoffman: I mean it's no
different than, you know,

00:45:25.287 --> 00:45:27.825 align:middle line:84%
you're on line for a roller
coaster-- >> Regina: Exactly.

00:45:27.825 --> 00:45:29.060 align:middle line:84%
>> Hoffman: -- a long line
and you're right in the front

00:45:29.060 --> 00:45:30.862 align:middle line:84%
and then they say, "Alright,
you're kicked out of line,

00:45:30.862 --> 00:45:33.131 align:middle line:84%
you got to go to the back of
the line-- >> Regina: Right.

00:45:33.131 --> 00:45:34.432 align:middle line:84%
>> Hoffman: --
because, you know,

00:45:34.432 --> 00:45:35.900 align:middle line:84%
when you leave your health
insurance plan and then you got

00:45:35.900 --> 00:45:38.770 align:middle line:84%
to go back in, you know, it's
the cost-- >> Regina: Oh,

00:45:38.770 --> 00:45:39.270 align:middle line:90%
forget it.

00:45:39.270 --> 00:45:39.604 align:middle line:90%
>> Hoffman: -- dramatic higher.

00:45:39.604 --> 00:45:40.638 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

00:45:40.638 --> 00:45:41.573 align:middle line:84%
>> Regina: So, if
you've been bumped now,

00:45:41.573 --> 00:45:43.031 align:middle line:84%
nobody's going to
take you back on.

00:45:43.031 --> 00:45:45.265 align:middle line:84%
You can't even get into
the computerized system

00:45:45.265 --> 00:45:47.579 align:middle line:84%
to sign up for Obamacare
if you wanted to.

00:45:47.579 --> 00:45:51.649 align:middle line:84%
That-- it's a disaster just
from a technical point of view.

00:45:51.649 --> 00:45:53.685 align:middle line:84%
What's happening when
you have millions

00:45:53.685 --> 00:45:55.486 align:middle line:90%
of people now vulnerable?

00:45:55.486 --> 00:45:58.856 align:middle line:84%
Does MediCal pick it up-- I
mean just like it always has?

00:45:58.856 --> 00:46:00.491 align:middle line:84%
What happens when
there's a problem?

00:46:00.491 --> 00:46:03.032 align:middle line:84%
>> Hoffman: Well, again, this
is going to be questions better

00:46:03.032 --> 00:46:04.863 align:middle line:84%
for the doctor--
>> Regina: Yeah.

00:46:04.863 --> 00:46:07.279 align:middle line:84%
>> Hoffman: -- because I didn't
even understand this whole

00:46:07.279 --> 00:46:09.534 align:middle line:84%
concept of this website and
signing up for Obamacare.

00:46:09.534 --> 00:46:10.702 align:middle line:90%
>> Regina: Right.

00:46:10.702 --> 00:46:11.603 align:middle line:84%
>> Hoffman: I thought it
was just kind of a mandate--

00:46:11.603 --> 00:46:12.704 align:middle line:84%
>> Regina: And
you're a smart guy.

00:46:12.704 --> 00:46:14.922 align:middle line:84%
>> Hoffman: And I really
honestly have no idea how it

00:46:14.922 --> 00:46:16.274 align:middle line:90%
works-- >> Regina: Right.

00:46:16.274 --> 00:46:18.117 align:middle line:84%
>> Hoffman: -- other than the
financial aspect which I know

00:46:18.117 --> 00:46:19.244 align:middle line:90%
is going to be catastrophic.

00:46:19.244 --> 00:46:20.119 align:middle line:90%
>> Regina: So-- yeah.

00:46:20.119 --> 00:46:21.145 align:middle line:90%
>> Hoffman: Yeah.

00:46:21.145 --> 00:46:24.515 align:middle line:84%
But there'll be many people who
will get free health insurance,

00:46:24.515 --> 00:46:26.587 align:middle line:84%
you know, a lot
of illegal aliens

00:46:26.587 --> 00:46:27.976 align:middle line:90%
will get health insurance.

00:46:27.976 --> 00:46:29.684 align:middle line:84%
You know, people-- >>
Regina: But they're

00:46:29.684 --> 00:46:30.559 align:middle line:90%
taken care of anyway.

00:46:30.559 --> 00:46:33.024 align:middle line:84%
>> Hoffman: -- people who
have-- >> Regina: Yeah.

00:46:33.024 --> 00:46:34.092 align:middle line:84%
>> Hoffman: -- no income-- I
mean that's great conceptually.

00:46:34.092 --> 00:46:35.300 align:middle line:90%
And that's the saddest thing.

00:46:35.300 --> 00:46:37.829 align:middle line:84%
You know, I talked to a
lot of intelligent people,

00:46:37.829 --> 00:46:40.445 align:middle line:84%
family members even, and
they'll say, "Well, it's

00:46:40.445 --> 00:46:43.550 align:middle line:84%
a great thing because everyone
should have health insurance."

00:46:43.550 --> 00:46:45.091 align:middle line:84%
But yes, there's a
lot of things that

00:46:45.091 --> 00:46:46.549 align:middle line:84%
should happen in
the world, but you

00:46:46.549 --> 00:46:47.805 align:middle line:90%
have to be able to pay for it.

00:46:47.805 --> 00:46:51.711 align:middle line:84%
And between the direct and the
indirect costs that Obamacare

00:46:51.711 --> 00:46:57.249 align:middle line:84%
is going to cause on Americans,
it's-- A, it's not feasible,

00:46:57.249 --> 00:46:59.929 align:middle line:84%
and B, when everyone
sees in the aftermath,

00:46:59.929 --> 00:47:02.854 align:middle line:84%
they'll realize that we
should have never done it.

00:47:02.854 --> 00:47:06.853 align:middle line:84%
>> Regina: It's
looking that that way.

00:47:06.853 --> 00:47:09.394 align:middle line:84%
Well, I wanted-- we're talking
about gold a little while ago.

00:47:09.394 --> 00:47:11.262 align:middle line:84%
I'm hopping around a bit
because we have so many topics

00:47:11.262 --> 00:47:12.697 align:middle line:90%
to get in in a short time.

00:47:12.697 --> 00:47:13.533 align:middle line:90%
We touched on it.

00:47:13.533 --> 00:47:15.199 align:middle line:84%
So I want to go back
there for a moment.

00:47:15.199 --> 00:47:17.978 align:middle line:84%
So you're talking
about gold has been,

00:47:17.978 --> 00:47:20.136 align:middle line:84%
you know, classically,
historically-- gold

00:47:20.136 --> 00:47:23.420 align:middle line:84%
backed currencies have
been the only stability

00:47:23.420 --> 00:47:26.077 align:middle line:84%
or-- to a backbone
of an economy.

00:47:26.077 --> 00:47:29.881 align:middle line:84%
Now, what I'm wondering is
you see the prices of gold

00:47:29.881 --> 00:47:33.818 align:middle line:84%
on paper which have been
brutally suppressed and taken

00:47:33.818 --> 00:47:36.287 align:middle line:84%
down by whoever
controls these markets.

00:47:36.287 --> 00:47:38.560 align:middle line:84%
And at the same time,
you're finding shortages

00:47:38.560 --> 00:47:40.101 align:middle line:84%
of physical gold
which would indicate

00:47:40.101 --> 00:47:42.327 align:middle line:90%
the prices should be higher.

00:47:42.327 --> 00:47:43.261 align:middle line:90%
>> Hoffman: Right.

00:47:43.261 --> 00:47:44.495 align:middle line:84%
>> Regina: How do
we deal with that?

00:47:44.495 --> 00:47:46.531 align:middle line:84%
How do you navigate through
that world, gold and silver?

00:47:46.531 --> 00:47:48.739 align:middle line:84%
>> Hoffman: Well, that would
be my area of expertise.

00:47:48.739 --> 00:47:49.415 align:middle line:90%
>> Regina: Yeah.

00:47:49.415 --> 00:47:49.915 align:middle line:90%
I know.

00:47:49.915 --> 00:47:51.202 align:middle line:84%
That's why I want to ask
you because I know you know.

00:47:51.202 --> 00:47:52.577 align:middle line:84%
>> Hoffman: Well,
look, to start,

00:47:52.577 --> 00:47:54.315 align:middle line:84%
the reason that
gold and silver--

00:47:54.315 --> 00:47:56.407 align:middle line:84%
they're both
monetary currencies--

00:47:56.407 --> 00:47:59.811 align:middle line:84%
have been able to support
inflation free monetary systems

00:47:59.811 --> 00:48:02.647 align:middle line:84%
is because they're the only
substances throughout history

00:48:02.647 --> 00:48:05.950 align:middle line:84%
that have-- that meet all
the definitions of money.

00:48:05.950 --> 00:48:08.841 align:middle line:84%
Now, a dollar is
currency in that

00:48:08.841 --> 00:48:12.557 align:middle line:84%
it does spend-- you
can buy things with it.

00:48:12.557 --> 00:48:15.595 align:middle line:84%
It is fungible meaning you
can make change for it.

00:48:15.595 --> 00:48:17.720 align:middle line:84%
All dollar bills are the
same although now, they're

00:48:17.720 --> 00:48:19.364 align:middle line:84%
making so many
different hundred dollar

00:48:19.364 --> 00:48:21.072 align:middle line:84%
bills with different
hundred dollar bills

00:48:21.072 --> 00:48:22.905 align:middle line:84%
with different colors,
even that's changing.

00:48:22.905 --> 00:48:23.768 align:middle line:90%
>> Regina: Yeah.

00:48:23.768 --> 00:48:24.635 align:middle line:84%
>> Hoffman: But the fact is, you
can't even spend a dollar bill

00:48:24.635 --> 00:48:26.070 align:middle line:84%
in Canada right
now where there--

00:48:26.070 --> 00:48:28.424 align:middle line:84%
where it's almost parody
let alone around the world.

00:48:28.424 --> 00:48:29.173 align:middle line:90%
>> Regina: I know.

00:48:29.173 --> 00:48:29.774 align:middle line:90%
I was there recently.

00:48:29.774 --> 00:48:30.541 align:middle line:90%
>> Hoffman: Yeah.

00:48:30.541 --> 00:48:31.709 align:middle line:90%
>> Regina: They don't want them.

00:48:31.709 --> 00:48:33.378 align:middle line:84%
>> Hoffman: And more
importantly, it's not scarce.

00:48:33.378 --> 00:48:35.947 align:middle line:84%
They are-- you don't-- A, you
don't even know how many are

00:48:35.947 --> 00:48:38.449 align:middle line:84%
out there because so much
is printed beyond the scenes

00:48:38.449 --> 00:48:40.782 align:middle line:84%
and there's no scarcity because
they could print as much

00:48:40.782 --> 00:48:41.919 align:middle line:90%
as they want, and are.

00:48:41.919 --> 00:48:44.322 align:middle line:84%
And of course, it's
not a storage of value.

00:48:44.322 --> 00:48:49.427 align:middle line:84%
The dollar has lost 98 percent
of its purchasing power

00:48:49.427 --> 00:48:51.896 align:middle line:84%
since the fed
started it in 1913.

00:48:51.896 --> 00:48:54.499 align:middle line:84%
It will keep going until
it loses all of it.

00:48:54.499 --> 00:48:56.667 align:middle line:84%
Gold and silver are--
meet all of those things.

00:48:56.667 --> 00:48:59.437 align:middle line:84%
They are a medium of exchange,
they're widely accepted,

00:48:59.437 --> 00:49:02.100 align:middle line:84%
they cannot be diluted and
they've been around storing

00:49:02.100 --> 00:49:04.675 align:middle line:90%
value for thousands of years.

00:49:04.675 --> 00:49:06.835 align:middle line:84%
That's why-- that's
why it works,

00:49:06.835 --> 00:49:09.407 align:middle line:84%
but they're very scarce
and very few people

00:49:09.407 --> 00:49:11.382 align:middle line:84%
have them and can
afford them even

00:49:11.382 --> 00:49:13.418 align:middle line:90%
at currently depressed prices.

00:49:13.418 --> 00:49:15.570 align:middle line:84%
Now, as to your question
about the disparity

00:49:15.570 --> 00:49:17.855 align:middle line:84%
in the paper and the
physical markets,

00:49:17.855 --> 00:49:20.075 align:middle line:84%
there's always been--
physical metals always

00:49:20.075 --> 00:49:23.723 align:middle line:84%
cost more than what I call
paper gold and silver, what

00:49:23.723 --> 00:49:25.323 align:middle line:84%
you see on your
screen, because there

00:49:25.323 --> 00:49:27.164 align:middle line:84%
is a cost of
marketing and refining

00:49:27.164 --> 00:49:28.943 align:middle line:84%
and all of those--
>> Regina: Delivery.

00:49:28.943 --> 00:49:30.234 align:middle line:90%
>> Hoffman: -- kinds of things.

00:49:30.234 --> 00:49:32.336 align:middle line:84%
But the things is those
premiums as we call them,

00:49:32.336 --> 00:49:35.173 align:middle line:90%
they can wildly change.

00:49:35.173 --> 00:49:38.621 align:middle line:84%
In 2008, when the government
attacked gold and silver

00:49:38.621 --> 00:49:40.638 align:middle line:84%
duringthe 2008
crisis because they

00:49:40.638 --> 00:49:43.014 align:middle line:84%
didn't want people racing
into it, they-- we--

00:49:43.014 --> 00:49:44.248 align:middle line:90%
the whole world ran out.

00:49:44.248 --> 00:49:46.818 align:middle line:84%
Every mint ran out and
the premiums on silver

00:49:46.818 --> 00:49:49.983 align:middle line:84%
were 100 percent of the
price-- the price said

00:49:49.983 --> 00:49:54.200 align:middle line:84%
on your screen, 9 dollars
and if you only sell the ETF,

00:49:54.200 --> 00:49:55.693 align:middle line:90%
you lost your shirt.

00:49:55.693 --> 00:49:58.506 align:middle line:84%
But if you own the real thing,
we weren't-- you couldn't buy

00:49:58.506 --> 00:50:01.299 align:middle line:84%
it for less than 18
dollars an ounce.

00:50:01.299 --> 00:50:02.008 align:middle line:90%
>> Regina: Right.

00:50:02.008 --> 00:50:04.382 align:middle line:84%
>> Hoffman: And, you know,
right now even on a, you know,

00:50:04.382 --> 00:50:07.271 align:middle line:84%
in quiet marketing additions,
it's a 15 percent difference

00:50:07.271 --> 00:50:10.109 align:middle line:84%
for silver and maybe five
or percent or eight percent

00:50:10.109 --> 00:50:10.608 align:middle line:90%
for gold.

00:50:10.608 --> 00:50:11.672 align:middle line:84%
In fact, in India
right now where

00:50:11.672 --> 00:50:13.213 align:middle line:84%
they're trying to
restrict ownership,

00:50:13.213 --> 00:50:17.190 align:middle line:84%
we're seeing premiums of over
200 dollars an ounce for gold.

00:50:17.190 --> 00:50:17.815 align:middle line:90%
>> Regina: Wow.

00:50:17.815 --> 00:50:18.817 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:50:18.817 --> 00:50:20.192 align:middle line:84%
>> Hoffman: So
it's a-- you know,

00:50:20.192 --> 00:50:22.792 align:middle line:84%
there's-- we've seen several
shortages this year alone

00:50:22.792 --> 00:50:23.488 align:middle line:90%
in silver.

00:50:23.488 --> 00:50:27.758 align:middle line:84%
The mint ran out for 14
days back in January.

00:50:27.758 --> 00:50:30.495 align:middle line:84%
In April, there was a big
government attack on gold.

00:50:30.495 --> 00:50:31.863 align:middle line:90%
And the same thing happened.

00:50:31.863 --> 00:50:34.950 align:middle line:84%
The premiums rocketed
higher and they're still

00:50:34.950 --> 00:50:37.168 align:middle line:84%
elevated compared to
where they have been.

00:50:37.168 --> 00:50:38.652 align:middle line:84%
And, you know, the
next crisis that

00:50:38.652 --> 00:50:40.362 align:middle line:84%
comes, what you're
going to see is--

00:50:40.362 --> 00:50:43.624 align:middle line:84%
you're going to see a complete
break between the physical

00:50:43.624 --> 00:50:44.779 align:middle line:90%
and the paper.

00:50:44.779 --> 00:50:47.278 align:middle line:84%
And that's why, you shouldn't
think of it in terms of price.

00:50:47.278 --> 00:50:50.486 align:middle line:84%
You think in terms of how many
ounces do you own because when

00:50:50.486 --> 00:50:52.383 align:middle line:84%
the-- you know, when
it hits the fan,

00:50:52.383 --> 00:50:54.018 align:middle line:90%
either you have it or you don't.

00:50:54.018 --> 00:50:56.988 align:middle line:84%
We've ran out before and,
we will run out again.

00:50:56.988 --> 00:51:01.324 align:middle line:84%
>> Regina: So what is the supply
and demand right now in terms

00:51:01.324 --> 00:51:01.926 align:middle line:90%
of scarcity?

00:51:01.926 --> 00:51:03.628 align:middle line:90%
Is it flowing fairly easily?

00:51:03.628 --> 00:51:05.602 align:middle line:84%
You said there are
fairly low premiums

00:51:05.602 --> 00:51:08.165 align:middle line:84%
on gold, maybe five or six
percent, something like that.

00:51:08.165 --> 00:51:10.200 align:middle line:84%
That must mean-- >> Hoffman: In
the United States-- >> Regina:

00:51:10.200 --> 00:51:10.902 align:middle line:90%
-- it's flowing?

00:51:10.902 --> 00:51:11.802 align:middle line:84%
>> Hoffman: -- it's just
such an incredible dichotomy

00:51:11.802 --> 00:51:14.291 align:middle line:84%
because between all the
propaganda and supporting

00:51:14.291 --> 00:51:16.774 align:middle line:84%
the DOW and all
this, and, you know,

00:51:16.774 --> 00:51:19.614 align:middle line:84%
there's constant talk about
the economy's recovering even

00:51:19.614 --> 00:51:23.280 align:middle line:84%
though it's not-- things
have quieted down in my part

00:51:23.280 --> 00:51:26.050 align:middle line:84%
of the world, in the
Western Hemisphere.

00:51:26.050 --> 00:51:29.720 align:middle line:84%
But if you look in the east,
Chinese physical demand

00:51:29.720 --> 00:51:31.322 align:middle line:84%
has-- last year
was a record high

00:51:31.322 --> 00:51:33.090 align:middle line:84%
and this year was
more than doubling.

00:51:33.090 --> 00:51:35.026 align:middle line:84%
And I was in China
two months ago.

00:51:35.026 --> 00:51:36.727 align:middle line:90%
I was in the gold shops.

00:51:36.727 --> 00:51:37.948 align:middle line:90%
It's crazy.

00:51:37.948 --> 00:51:40.364 align:middle line:84%
I mean here, there might be
five gold shops in each state.

00:51:40.364 --> 00:51:43.000 align:middle line:84%
There, there were 10 shops in
a row just in one little space

00:51:43.000 --> 00:51:46.200 align:middle line:84%
and they were full
of people buying gold

00:51:46.200 --> 00:51:48.606 align:middle line:84%
with huge teams of people
selling it to them.

00:51:48.606 --> 00:51:50.174 align:middle line:90%
So it's a big deal.

00:51:50.174 --> 00:51:53.444 align:middle line:84%
You're seeing record Indian
silver demand this year despite

00:51:53.444 --> 00:51:55.957 align:middle line:84%
the government putting a 15
percent tariff-- >> Regina:

00:51:55.957 --> 00:51:57.214 align:middle line:84%
Is that because the-- >>
Hoffman: -- on purchases.

00:51:57.214 --> 00:51:59.463 align:middle line:84%
>> Regina: -- the gold is so--
is still too high there with

00:51:59.463 --> 00:52:00.818 align:middle line:84%
the 200 percent increase
so-- >> Hoffman: Yeah.

00:52:00.818 --> 00:52:03.020 align:middle line:84%
So-- >> Regina: -- so
they're going to silver?

00:52:03.020 --> 00:52:04.712 align:middle line:84%
>> Hoffman: -- they're scared
that people are going to run

00:52:04.712 --> 00:52:07.045 align:middle line:84%
the currency to nothing so
they're putting these tariffs

00:52:07.045 --> 00:52:09.443 align:middle line:84%
on India but there's a huge
black market that's been

00:52:09.443 --> 00:52:10.027 align:middle line:90%
emerging.

00:52:10.027 --> 00:52:12.964 align:middle line:84%
And the premiums for what
is there are off the charts

00:52:12.964 --> 00:52:14.098 align:middle line:90%
right now.

00:52:14.098 --> 00:52:16.267 align:middle line:84%
So basically, you look
in the Eastern Hemisphere

00:52:16.267 --> 00:52:18.367 align:middle line:84%
and you're seeing
record demand right now,

00:52:18.367 --> 00:52:20.201 align:middle line:84%
whereas a lot of the
Western Hemisphere-- >>

00:52:20.201 --> 00:52:22.158 align:middle line:84%
Regina: Why does-- I mean
it's a global market.

00:52:22.158 --> 00:52:24.475 align:middle line:84%
Why isn't that not impacting
what's happening here?

00:52:24.475 --> 00:52:27.378 align:middle line:84%
>> Hoffman: Because as I said,
the fed has been exporting

00:52:27.378 --> 00:52:30.453 align:middle line:84%
so much inflation around the
world that those areas are

00:52:30.453 --> 00:52:31.808 align:middle line:90%
feeling it more than we are.

00:52:31.808 --> 00:52:32.516 align:middle line:90%
>> Regina: I see.

00:52:32.516 --> 00:52:33.016 align:middle line:90%
Got you.

00:52:33.016 --> 00:52:35.307 align:middle line:84%
>> Hoffman: So those people
are in more fear right now.

00:52:35.307 --> 00:52:36.253 align:middle line:90%
>> Regina: Right.

00:52:36.253 --> 00:52:37.622 align:middle line:84%
>> Hoffman: And look,
inflation is terrible here.

00:52:37.622 --> 00:52:39.991 align:middle line:84%
We're talking about
Obamacare among other things

00:52:39.991 --> 00:52:43.961 align:middle line:84%
but people have been so used to
it like frogs in a pot of this,

00:52:43.961 --> 00:52:46.297 align:middle line:84%
you know, five to 10 percent
inflation every year.

00:52:46.297 --> 00:52:48.684 align:middle line:84%
They consider it,
you know, normal but,

00:52:48.684 --> 00:52:51.015 align:middle line:84%
you know, what you're seeing
in a place like Brazil,

00:52:51.015 --> 00:52:53.048 align:middle line:84%
remember I mean, there's
300 million people

00:52:53.048 --> 00:52:57.172 align:middle line:84%
in Brazil rioting in the streets
for months this summer because

00:52:57.172 --> 00:52:57.975 align:middle line:90%
of inflation.

00:52:57.975 --> 00:52:58.843 align:middle line:90%
This is Brazil.

00:52:58.843 --> 00:53:00.778 align:middle line:84%
This is not the
middle of Africa.

00:53:00.778 --> 00:53:01.979 align:middle line:90%
>> Regina: Right.

00:53:01.979 --> 00:53:03.714 align:middle line:84%
>> Hoffman: So, you know,
people in places like that--

00:53:03.714 --> 00:53:06.005 align:middle line:84%
>> Regina: A country that
actually was crawling out was

00:53:06.005 --> 00:53:06.784 align:middle line:90%
doing pretty well.

00:53:06.784 --> 00:53:07.885 align:middle line:90%
>> Hoffman: It's a BRIC, right?

00:53:07.885 --> 00:53:08.953 align:middle line:90%
>> Regina: It's a BRIC.

00:53:08.953 --> 00:53:11.756 align:middle line:84%
It had a lot of progressive
industry going on

00:53:11.756 --> 00:53:14.058 align:middle line:84%
and biofuels, all
kinds of things.

00:53:14.058 --> 00:53:15.604 align:middle line:84%
And they're suffering
to that extent.

00:53:15.604 --> 00:53:18.062 align:middle line:84%
>> Hoffman: But again, you
know, we talked about the BRICS.

00:53:18.062 --> 00:53:22.166 align:middle line:84%
It's Brazil, Russia, India,
China, and South Africa.

00:53:22.166 --> 00:53:24.509 align:middle line:84%
You know, this was almost
like a propaganda scheme

00:53:24.509 --> 00:53:26.675 align:middle line:84%
in itself of how this is
where the world is shifting

00:53:26.675 --> 00:53:28.301 align:middle line:84%
but the fact is-- >> Regina:
India has dropped out,

00:53:28.301 --> 00:53:30.123 align:middle line:84%
it sounds like-- >> Hoffman:
India, South Africa and Brazil

00:53:30.123 --> 00:53:31.075 align:middle line:90%
are three of the Fragile Fives.

00:53:31.075 --> 00:53:31.709 align:middle line:90%
>> Regina: Exactly.

00:53:31.709 --> 00:53:32.476 align:middle line:90%
So what about Russia?

00:53:32.476 --> 00:53:33.844 align:middle line:90%
We haven't talked about Russia.

00:53:33.844 --> 00:53:35.260 align:middle line:84%
>> Hoffman: Well,
Russia actually,

00:53:35.260 --> 00:53:37.248 align:middle line:84%
it's ironic that not only
are they becoming one

00:53:37.248 --> 00:53:39.917 align:middle line:84%
of the wealthiest nations in
the world but they're being run

00:53:39.917 --> 00:53:43.621 align:middle line:84%
by Vladimir Putin who was around
when the United States won

00:53:43.621 --> 00:53:46.585 align:middle line:84%
the Cold War and has quite
the vendetta against us--

00:53:46.585 --> 00:53:48.626 align:middle line:84%
>> Regina: I guess-- >>
Hoffman: -- as he should.

00:53:48.626 --> 00:53:49.827 align:middle line:90%
>> Regina: Yes.

00:53:49.827 --> 00:53:50.594 align:middle line:84%
>> Hoffman: He's one of the
most brilliant businessmen

00:53:50.594 --> 00:53:53.515 align:middle line:84%
in the world and because
of all of their resources,

00:53:53.515 --> 00:53:55.232 align:middle line:90%
they don't-- >> Regina: Yes.

00:53:55.232 --> 00:53:56.645 align:middle line:84%
>> Hoffman: -- have a lot of
population but they have a lot

00:53:56.645 --> 00:53:56.867 align:middle line:90%
of resources.

00:53:56.867 --> 00:53:57.902 align:middle line:90%
>> Regina: A lot of resources.

00:53:57.902 --> 00:53:59.870 align:middle line:84%
>> Hoffman: They've become
extremely wealthy and they have

00:53:59.870 --> 00:54:02.606 align:middle line:84%
been acquiring gold like it's
going out of style as well.

00:54:02.606 --> 00:54:05.242 align:middle line:84%
And they've been forging
relationships with the Chinese.

00:54:05.242 --> 00:54:08.181 align:middle line:84%
So there's a new axis
that's forming in the east

00:54:08.181 --> 00:54:09.847 align:middle line:84%
and the Russians are
a major part of it.

00:54:09.847 --> 00:54:11.649 align:middle line:84%
And just look at--
just look again

00:54:11.649 --> 00:54:13.718 align:middle line:90%
from a geopolitical standpoint.

00:54:13.718 --> 00:54:16.320 align:middle line:84%
Look what Russia did
with Syria this year.

00:54:16.320 --> 00:54:18.923 align:middle line:84%
I mean we were hell
bent on bombing Syria.

00:54:18.923 --> 00:54:20.524 align:middle line:84%
There's no doubt
we were going to.

00:54:20.524 --> 00:54:21.233 align:middle line:90%
>> Regina: Right.

00:54:21.233 --> 00:54:23.440 align:middle line:84%
>> Hoffman: Until Putin
pretty much came in and said,

00:54:23.440 --> 00:54:24.995 align:middle line:84%
"You guys really
want to do this?"

00:54:24.995 --> 00:54:27.665 align:middle line:84%
And he forced Obama and
the West to back down.

00:54:27.665 --> 00:54:30.712 align:middle line:84%
I mean this is a major power
shift that's going from

00:54:30.712 --> 00:54:33.428 align:middle line:84%
the west to east and Russia's
going to be a major part

00:54:33.428 --> 00:54:36.923 align:middle line:84%
of the new -- I don't mean new
world order but I mean when you

00:54:36.923 --> 00:54:39.510 align:middle line:84%
have a new world economic
system-- >> Regina: Alliance--

00:54:39.510 --> 00:54:40.010 align:middle line:90%
yes.

00:54:40.010 --> 00:54:40.682 align:middle line:84%
>> Hoffman: -- with
the currencies,

00:54:40.682 --> 00:54:42.213 align:middle line:84%
they're going to be one
of the strong countries.

00:54:42.213 --> 00:54:43.581 align:middle line:90%
>> Regina: Interesting.

00:54:43.581 --> 00:54:46.081 align:middle line:84%
>> Hoffman: Not one of the best
places to live but certainly

00:54:46.081 --> 00:54:47.785 align:middle line:90%
one of the stronger economies.

00:54:47.785 --> 00:54:48.688 align:middle line:90%
>> Regina: Yeah.

00:54:48.688 --> 00:54:51.021 align:middle line:84%
I wouldn't trade Arizona for
Siberia-- >> Hoffman: Yeah.

00:54:51.021 --> 00:54:52.389 align:middle line:90%
>> Regina: -- that's for sure.

00:54:52.389 --> 00:54:52.889 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:54:52.889 --> 00:54:56.325 align:middle line:84%
So now, just kind of coming
around to just one more

00:54:56.325 --> 00:54:58.162 align:middle line:84%
question about kind
of what's not working.

00:54:58.162 --> 00:55:01.932 align:middle line:84%
Are there some-- which -- if
you could wave your magic wand,

00:55:01.932 --> 00:55:05.035 align:middle line:84%
foolhardy practices or
financial instruments,

00:55:05.035 --> 00:55:07.905 align:middle line:84%
would you just say, we
can't do this anymore.

00:55:07.905 --> 00:55:10.536 align:middle line:84%
And actually personally
have some control over

00:55:10.536 --> 00:55:12.015 align:middle line:90%
to clean up our own acts.

00:55:12.015 --> 00:55:14.515 align:middle line:84%
I mean obviously you can't speak
for the large-- >> Hoffman:

00:55:14.515 --> 00:55:16.848 align:middle line:84%
Well, the system is broken
because the banks now own it.

00:55:16.848 --> 00:55:19.450 align:middle line:84%
And that was the part of the
whole Glass Steagall breaking.

00:55:19.450 --> 00:55:20.117 align:middle line:90%
>> Regina: Yeah.

00:55:20.117 --> 00:55:22.741 align:middle line:84%
>> Hoffman: The banks became so
rich and powerful that they are

00:55:22.741 --> 00:55:25.322 align:middle line:84%
now are, you know, the biggest
lobbyers in the country.

00:55:25.322 --> 00:55:27.443 align:middle line:84%
Actually, the only
bigger lobbyer-- lobbyers

00:55:27.443 --> 00:55:28.959 align:middle line:84%
are the healthcare
and the military.

00:55:28.959 --> 00:55:30.247 align:middle line:84%
>> Regina: I was
going to-- Yeah,

00:55:30.247 --> 00:55:31.328 align:middle line:84%
I was going to say has
to be pharmaceutical.

00:55:31.328 --> 00:55:32.036 align:middle line:90%
>> Hoffman: Yeah.

00:55:32.036 --> 00:55:33.063 align:middle line:90%
>> Regina: Yeah.

00:55:33.063 --> 00:55:34.298 align:middle line:84%
>> Hoffman: So that's hence
you got Obamacare hence--

00:55:34.298 --> 00:55:35.466 align:middle line:90%
>> Regina: Right.

00:55:35.466 --> 00:55:37.039 align:middle line:84%
>> Hoffman: -- you know, the
ability for these guys to grow

00:55:37.039 --> 00:55:38.469 align:middle line:90%
unfettered and all these wars.

00:55:38.469 --> 00:55:39.603 align:middle line:90%
>> Regina: You bet.

00:55:39.603 --> 00:55:42.181 align:middle line:84%
>> Hoffman: So, let's see we're
talking about-- >> Regina:

00:55:42.181 --> 00:55:44.795 align:middle line:84%
I was going to say anything
that you would say in a private

00:55:44.795 --> 00:55:45.442 align:middle line:90%
way-- >> Hoffman: All right.

00:55:45.442 --> 00:55:46.059 align:middle line:90%
Right.

00:55:46.059 --> 00:55:46.677 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

00:55:46.677 --> 00:55:47.178 align:middle line:84%
>> Regina: -- just not indulge
in anymore-- stay away.

00:55:47.178 --> 00:55:48.179 align:middle line:90%
>> Hoffman: Yes.

00:55:48.179 --> 00:55:49.692 align:middle line:84%
So we're talking about
that financial-- >> Regina:

00:55:49.692 --> 00:55:52.283 align:middle line:84%
We're looking at the fixes
now in 2014-- >> Hoffman: Yes.

00:55:52.283 --> 00:55:53.050 align:middle line:84%
>> Regina: -- coming up and we
only have about five minutes.

00:55:53.050 --> 00:55:55.746 align:middle line:84%
What can we just kind of ax--
we can't control the government,

00:55:55.746 --> 00:55:56.620 align:middle line:90%
we control ourselves.

00:55:56.620 --> 00:55:57.621 align:middle line:90%
>> Hoffman: Yes.

00:55:57.621 --> 00:55:59.329 align:middle line:84%
The financial system
is hopelessly broken

00:55:59.329 --> 00:56:03.260 align:middle line:84%
and you will see more and
more of these shoddy practices

00:56:03.260 --> 00:56:05.339 align:middle line:84%
but more of them are
behind the scenes right

00:56:05.339 --> 00:56:07.898 align:middle line:84%
now for, you know, for
public consumption.

00:56:07.898 --> 00:56:10.711 align:middle line:84%
From a personal standpoint,
what you need to do

00:56:10.711 --> 00:56:11.535 align:middle line:90%
is to be defensive.

00:56:11.535 --> 00:56:13.671 align:middle line:84%
>> Regina: What do we
want to stay away from?

00:56:13.671 --> 00:56:16.123 align:middle line:84%
>> Hoffman: I think you want
to stay away from all paper

00:56:16.123 --> 00:56:18.209 align:middle line:84%
investments and that
includes paper--

00:56:18.209 --> 00:56:20.360 align:middle line:84%
what I call paper PM
investments-- paper,

00:56:20.360 --> 00:56:23.816 align:middle line:84%
gold and silver which could mean
miners and ETFs and closed-in

00:56:23.816 --> 00:56:24.315 align:middle line:90%
funds.

00:56:24.315 --> 00:56:25.149 align:middle line:84%
>> Regina: They're
all over the place.

00:56:25.149 --> 00:56:26.094 align:middle line:90%
>> Hoffman: Yeah.

00:56:26.094 --> 00:56:28.052 align:middle line:84%
The stock market is
supported by the government

00:56:28.052 --> 00:56:29.453 align:middle line:90%
at unsustainable levels.

00:56:29.453 --> 00:56:32.663 align:middle line:84%
The bond market is off
the charts as the biggest

00:56:32.663 --> 00:56:34.730 align:middle line:84%
bubble in history
and pretty much

00:56:34.730 --> 00:56:36.549 align:middle line:84%
any dollar denominated
paper security

00:56:36.549 --> 00:56:40.364 align:middle line:84%
you're at themercy of
what the fed is doing,

00:56:40.364 --> 00:56:45.169 align:middle line:84%
what the behind the scene
plans are for printing money,

00:56:45.169 --> 00:56:46.704 align:middle line:90%
and I think it's very dangerous.

00:56:46.704 --> 00:56:48.639 align:middle line:84%
And that's why I
personally, five years ago,

00:56:48.639 --> 00:56:50.107 align:middle line:84%
got out of the
system completely.

00:56:50.107 --> 00:56:54.078 align:middle line:84%
You know, you don't have to
own 100 percent physical gold

00:56:54.078 --> 00:56:55.965 align:middle line:84%
and silver as I do
but-- >> Regina: You

00:56:55.965 --> 00:56:58.215 align:middle line:84%
can still own your house,
your land-- >> Hoffman: Yes.

00:56:58.215 --> 00:56:58.883 align:middle line:90%
And will.

00:56:58.883 --> 00:56:59.216 align:middle line:90%
>> Regina: -- you know.

00:56:59.216 --> 00:57:00.584 align:middle line:90%
That's-- >> Hoffman: That's me.

00:57:00.584 --> 00:57:02.319 align:middle line:84%
That's my only other
asset-- >> Regina: Exactly.

00:57:02.319 --> 00:57:03.320 align:middle line:84%
>> Hoffman:-- because
it's real items of value.

00:57:03.320 --> 00:57:05.028 align:middle line:84%
I'm not a believer in
mortgages and debts

00:57:05.028 --> 00:57:06.223 align:middle line:90%
if you can get out of them.

00:57:06.223 --> 00:57:06.932 align:middle line:90%
>> Regina: Right.

00:57:06.932 --> 00:57:09.014 align:middle line:84%
>> Hoffman: Some people
say, "Well it will be good

00:57:09.014 --> 00:57:11.829 align:middle line:84%
if there's inflation, having a
debt,"-- no generally speaking,

00:57:11.829 --> 00:57:15.266 align:middle line:84%
debt is a dangerous instrument
and it should be used very

00:57:15.266 --> 00:57:15.766 align:middle line:90%
carefully.

00:57:15.766 --> 00:57:18.972 align:middle line:84%
I would say just prepare
for the worst case scenario

00:57:18.972 --> 00:57:20.971 align:middle line:84%
but, you know, don't
assume it's going to happen

00:57:20.971 --> 00:57:23.371 align:middle line:84%
but that means put
yourself in a situation

00:57:23.371 --> 00:57:26.277 align:middle line:84%
where you can't lose if
the market's crash again--

00:57:26.277 --> 00:57:27.378 align:middle line:90%
>> Regina: Right.

00:57:27.378 --> 00:57:28.833 align:middle line:84%
>> Hoffman: -- or stocks crash,
or bonds crash-- >> Regina:

00:57:28.833 --> 00:57:29.847 align:middle line:84%
Where you're not--
you're immune from it.

00:57:29.847 --> 00:57:31.227 align:middle line:90%
>> Hoffman: Yeah.

00:57:31.227 --> 00:57:33.851 align:middle line:84%
And certainly don't hold all of
your money in paper currencies.

00:57:33.851 --> 00:57:35.219 align:middle line:90%
>> Regina: Right.

00:57:35.219 --> 00:57:36.453 align:middle line:84%
>> Hoffman: Everyone should own
at least some physical golds.

00:57:36.453 --> 00:57:38.252 align:middle line:84%
So-- >> Regina: When
people are hearing

00:57:38.252 --> 00:57:40.436 align:middle line:84%
you talk about the Chinese
yuan, renminbi becoming

00:57:40.436 --> 00:57:41.992 align:middle line:90%
their reserved currency.

00:57:41.992 --> 00:57:43.661 align:middle line:84%
They're saying, "Gee, why
shouldn't I buy some of that?"

00:57:43.661 --> 00:57:44.942 align:middle line:84%
>> Hoffman: Well,
first of all, there's

00:57:44.942 --> 00:57:47.074 align:middle line:84%
restrictions on the--
it's still not a fully

00:57:47.074 --> 00:57:48.032 align:middle line:90%
freely traded currency.

00:57:48.032 --> 00:57:49.333 align:middle line:90%
>> Regina: I see.

00:57:49.333 --> 00:57:52.202 align:middle line:84%
>> Hoffman: The only way you
can really buy it is this ETFs--

00:57:52.202 --> 00:57:53.003 align:middle line:90%
>> Regina: Right.

00:57:53.003 --> 00:57:54.093 align:middle line:84%
>> Hoffman: -- which
is again-- >> Regina:

00:57:54.093 --> 00:57:54.738 align:middle line:90%
Stay away from those.

00:57:54.738 --> 00:57:55.272 align:middle line:84%
>> Hoffman: -- part
of the paper system.

00:57:55.272 --> 00:57:56.009 align:middle line:90%
>> Regina: Right.

00:57:56.009 --> 00:57:57.675 align:middle line:84%
>> Hoffman: And you
can't really per se,

00:57:57.675 --> 00:57:59.043 align:middle line:90%
put your saving in renminbi.

00:57:59.043 --> 00:58:01.480 align:middle line:84%
You could probably put
something in it but not much.

00:58:01.480 --> 00:58:02.146 align:middle line:90%
>> Regina: Yeah.

00:58:02.146 --> 00:58:03.380 align:middle line:90%
>> Hoffman: But yes.

00:58:03.380 --> 00:58:06.497 align:middle line:84%
And remember the renminbi,
the yuan is also un backed.

00:58:06.497 --> 00:58:08.205 align:middle line:84%
I mean, yes, there's
a lot of gold that's

00:58:08.205 --> 00:58:09.897 align:middle line:84%
being built up behind
the scenes-- >> Regina:

00:58:09.897 --> 00:58:10.754 align:middle line:84%
But it's not a gold
backed currency?

00:58:10.754 --> 00:58:12.466 align:middle line:84%
>> Hoffman: -- that ultimately
will back it, but right now,

00:58:12.466 --> 00:58:15.007 align:middle line:84%
it's-- there's not a single gold
backed currency in the world

00:58:15.007 --> 00:58:18.622 align:middle line:84%
so it's probably safer in the
big picture but it's not really

00:58:18.622 --> 00:58:19.663 align:middle line:90%
investable for Americans.

00:58:19.663 --> 00:58:20.371 align:middle line:90%
>> Regina: Right.

00:58:20.371 --> 00:58:21.335 align:middle line:90%
So-- >> Hoffman: Yeah.

00:58:21.335 --> 00:58:23.793 align:middle line:84%
>> Regina: -- you were talking
awhile ago about how we have

00:58:23.793 --> 00:58:27.170 align:middle line:84%
exported our inflation and
we have created this kind

00:58:27.170 --> 00:58:30.947 align:middle line:84%
of cancer that's metastasizing
around the planet economically,

00:58:30.947 --> 00:58:31.475 align:middle line:90%
globally.

00:58:31.475 --> 00:58:34.078 align:middle line:84%
And that's going to climb
up the totem pole eventually

00:58:34.078 --> 00:58:38.048 align:middle line:84%
and where the U.S. economy is
at the top of the totem pole.

00:58:38.048 --> 00:58:40.017 align:middle line:84%
Is that when we start
looking at something?

00:58:40.017 --> 00:58:41.695 align:middle line:84%
We only have two
minutes left so-- is

00:58:41.695 --> 00:58:43.320 align:middle line:84%
that when we start
looking at something

00:58:43.320 --> 00:58:47.693 align:middle line:84%
that becomes a global
currency, a global economy?

00:58:47.693 --> 00:58:50.234 align:middle line:84%
>> Hoffman: Well, look again,
it's a Ponzi scheme that's near

00:58:50.234 --> 00:58:50.894 align:middle line:90%
the end stages.

00:58:50.894 --> 00:58:55.065 align:middle line:84%
Eventually-- the U.S. is going
to be-- when the U.S. dollar--

00:58:55.065 --> 00:58:57.723 align:middle line:84%
people lose confidence
in it, that's

00:58:57.723 --> 00:59:00.404 align:middle line:84%
going to be the end of
this current system.

00:59:00.404 --> 00:59:04.618 align:middle line:84%
A new system will emerge which
is not dollar centric, which

00:59:04.618 --> 00:59:06.562 align:middle line:84%
is not-- and in fact,
the Chinese just

00:59:06.562 --> 00:59:10.614 align:middle line:84%
called for a de Americanized
world just a week or two ago.

00:59:10.614 --> 00:59:13.550 align:middle line:84%
So the new world-- I'm not
saying the U.S. is going away,

00:59:13.550 --> 00:59:15.780 align:middle line:84%
but it's not going to
be a super power anymore

00:59:15.780 --> 00:59:17.833 align:middle line:84%
and the dollar-- we have--
our standard of living

00:59:17.833 --> 00:59:20.657 align:middle line:84%
is going to fall to
the global average.

00:59:20.657 --> 00:59:24.595 align:middle line:84%
And the new system, will be--
it'll be very rocky between now

00:59:24.595 --> 00:59:26.795 align:middle line:84%
and when we get
there, but I don't

00:59:26.795 --> 00:59:28.468 align:middle line:84%
know what it's
going to look like

00:59:28.468 --> 00:59:30.356 align:middle line:84%
only that there will
be a lot of pain

00:59:30.356 --> 00:59:32.302 align:middle line:90%
before we get to the new system.

00:59:32.302 --> 00:59:34.304 align:middle line:84%
And that's why people
need to prepare.

00:59:34.304 --> 00:59:35.039 align:middle line:90%
>> Regina: Yeah.

00:59:35.039 --> 00:59:36.163 align:middle line:90%
I mean it seems inevitable.

00:59:36.163 --> 00:59:37.141 align:middle line:90%
We are enmeshed now.

00:59:37.141 --> 00:59:39.623 align:middle line:84%
All of our countries, our
economies, our resources

00:59:39.623 --> 00:59:40.544 align:middle line:90%
are all enmeshed.

00:59:40.544 --> 00:59:43.392 align:middle line:84%
And, you know, everyone's--
certainly anyone watching this

00:59:43.392 --> 00:59:45.860 align:middle line:84%
does not like the sound
of one world government,

00:59:45.860 --> 00:59:48.595 align:middle line:84%
one world currency or anything
like that but in the end,

00:59:48.595 --> 00:59:52.331 align:middle line:84%
do you think it's possible that
there is some kind of healthy

00:59:52.331 --> 00:59:54.925 align:middle line:84%
sort of reset to-- >>
Hoffman: Absolutely.

00:59:54.925 --> 00:59:57.361 align:middle line:84%
>> Regina: -- to create
something where we are

00:59:57.361 --> 01:00:01.078 align:middle line:84%
in a position of having
currencies and resources ebb

01:00:01.078 --> 01:00:04.116 align:middle line:84%
and flow and flow between
countries so that as you say it

01:00:04.116 --> 01:00:05.501 align:middle line:84%
will be a little more of an
even playing field-- >> Hoffman:

01:00:05.501 --> 01:00:05.669 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

01:00:05.669 --> 01:00:06.170 align:middle line:90%
That's true.

01:00:06.170 --> 01:00:07.371 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

01:00:07.371 --> 01:00:08.605 align:middle line:84%
>> Regina: -- but it could
be-- could it be healthy?

01:00:08.605 --> 01:00:10.854 align:middle line:84%
>> Hoffman: The trade barriers
are permanently broken.

01:00:10.854 --> 01:00:11.942 align:middle line:90%
It will be a global world.

01:00:11.942 --> 01:00:14.318 align:middle line:84%
I mean, yes, in the
meantime you may

01:00:14.318 --> 01:00:16.914 align:middle line:84%
have some tariffs and all kinds
of things and protectionism,

01:00:16.914 --> 01:00:19.330 align:middle line:84%
but in the big picture, it's
going to be a global economy.

01:00:19.330 --> 01:00:22.386 align:middle line:84%
And when you get back to a
real currency, real money,

01:00:22.386 --> 01:00:25.255 align:middle line:84%
you're going to see healthy
growth in the global economy,

01:00:25.255 --> 01:00:27.724 align:middle line:84%
but we need to get
to that real money.

01:00:27.724 --> 01:00:28.503 align:middle line:90%
>> Regina: Right.

01:00:28.503 --> 01:00:30.794 align:middle line:84%
>> Hoffman: We need the fiat
currency to destroy itself

01:00:30.794 --> 01:00:32.396 align:middle line:84%
first and then we'll move
on to greener pastures.

01:00:32.396 --> 01:00:33.937 align:middle line:84%
>> Regina: Creating
something better.

01:00:33.937 --> 01:00:34.765 align:middle line:90%
>> Hoffman: Yes.

01:00:34.765 --> 01:00:36.223 align:middle line:84%
>> Regina: Andy,
thank you so much.

01:00:36.223 --> 01:00:39.103 align:middle line:84%
Let's wait till-- around
April-- >> Hoffman: Sure.

01:00:39.103 --> 01:00:40.895 align:middle line:84%
>> Regina: -- of 2014
and see what happens.

01:00:40.895 --> 01:00:41.644 align:middle line:90%
>> Hoffman: Right.

01:00:41.644 --> 01:00:42.306 align:middle line:90%
>> Regina: OK.

01:00:42.306 --> 01:00:44.208 align:middle line:90%
Loads to tiptoe through here.

01:00:44.208 --> 01:00:47.330 align:middle line:84%
It seems as though there really
isn't a safe place any longer.

01:00:47.330 --> 01:00:49.913 align:middle line:84%
Maybe a little gold, silver, a
little bit of land and a house,

01:00:49.913 --> 01:00:53.183 align:middle line:84%
a shack even, and that's why
I wanted to bring Andy back

01:00:53.183 --> 01:00:54.762 align:middle line:84%
on board to talk
to us about this

01:00:54.762 --> 01:00:56.053 align:middle line:90%
and get a little reality check.

01:00:56.053 --> 01:00:58.480 align:middle line:84%
So we will see where we're
at after the first quarter

01:00:58.480 --> 01:00:59.356 align:middle line:90%
of next year.

01:00:59.356 --> 01:01:03.660 align:middle line:84%
Until next time, thank you for
joining us here on Gaiam TV.
