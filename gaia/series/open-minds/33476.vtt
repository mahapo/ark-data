00:00:20.321 --> 00:00:22.123 align:middle line:84%
>> Regina Meredith: It's no
surprise that the generation

00:00:22.123 --> 00:00:24.859 align:middle line:84%
of people 30 and under are
having a rough ride of it.

00:00:24.859 --> 00:00:27.228 align:middle line:84%
Their generation is the
largest birth demographic

00:00:27.228 --> 00:00:30.531 align:middle line:84%
in modern history, just in
time for ecological decline,

00:00:30.531 --> 00:00:33.400 align:middle line:84%
financial chaos, and
governmental upheaval.

00:00:33.400 --> 00:00:34.568 align:middle line:90%
So how do they cope?

00:00:34.568 --> 00:00:37.304 align:middle line:84%
Astrologer Robert Phoenix
says by indulgence.

00:00:37.304 --> 00:00:39.440 align:middle line:84%
What would we expect
from a generation born

00:00:39.440 --> 00:00:42.076 align:middle line:90%
under Pluto in Scorpio, right?

00:00:42.076 --> 00:00:43.277 align:middle line:90%
>> Robert Phoenix: That's right.

00:00:43.277 --> 00:00:44.478 align:middle line:84%
>> Regina Meredith: Whole
different breed of cat.

00:00:44.478 --> 00:00:47.581 align:middle line:84%
In our last conversation,
we talked about the --

00:00:47.581 --> 00:00:51.752 align:middle line:84%
well, the "Me Generation,"
Leo, the "baby boomers."

00:00:51.752 --> 00:00:55.022 align:middle line:84%
And then we talked just a
little bit about your generation

00:00:55.022 --> 00:00:57.291 align:middle line:84%
which was under the sign
of Virgo -- Pluto in Virgo.

00:00:57.291 --> 00:00:57.791 align:middle line:90%
>> Robert Phoenix: That's right.

00:00:57.791 --> 00:00:58.759 align:middle line:90%
Yep.

00:00:58.759 --> 00:01:00.060 align:middle line:84%
>> Regina Meredith:
And then we went

00:01:00.060 --> 00:01:01.395 align:middle line:84%
through in just a little
bit of those who are trying

00:01:01.395 --> 00:01:04.198 align:middle line:84%
to make life look good and
feel good and find balance,

00:01:04.198 --> 00:01:06.066 align:middle line:90%
the Libra generation, right?

00:01:06.066 --> 00:01:08.769 align:middle line:84%
And that's up until the
age of about 30, right?

00:01:08.769 --> 00:01:09.903 align:middle line:90%
>> Robert Phoenix: Yeah

00:01:09.903 --> 00:01:10.738 align:middle line:84%
>> Regina Meredith: Now
we're hitting people 30

00:01:10.738 --> 00:01:12.606 align:middle line:90%
and under in this conversation.

00:01:12.606 --> 00:01:14.008 align:middle line:84%
>> Robert Phoenix:
That's correct, yes.

00:01:14.008 --> 00:01:16.277 align:middle line:84%
>> Regina Meredith:
Okay, so let's just --

00:01:16.277 --> 00:01:20.581 align:middle line:84%
first of all, how do you
put the current events

00:01:20.581 --> 00:01:25.352 align:middle line:84%
that are happening around
Trayvon Martin into this?

00:01:25.352 --> 00:01:26.353 align:middle line:90%
>> Robert Phoenix: Well, okay.

00:01:26.353 --> 00:01:27.955 align:middle line:90%
Well, that's a big question.

00:01:27.955 --> 00:01:34.195 align:middle line:84%
And I think that -- I think we
have to step back a little bit

00:01:34.195 --> 00:01:37.631 align:middle line:84%
to answer that question and we
have to look at evolutionary --

00:01:37.631 --> 00:01:40.401 align:middle line:84%
from an evolutionary
perspective,

00:01:40.401 --> 00:01:45.772 align:middle line:84%
where what I call Generation
Triple X came into play,

00:01:45.772 --> 00:01:49.443 align:middle line:84%
and what they were raised on
and some of the cultural and...

00:01:49.443 --> 00:01:51.145 align:middle line:84%
>> Regina Meredith: Triple
X, you're going to explain

00:01:51.145 --> 00:01:52.947 align:middle line:90%
that in a little bit [laugher].

00:01:52.947 --> 00:01:53.781 align:middle line:90%
>> Robert Phoenix: Yeah.

00:01:53.781 --> 00:01:55.049 align:middle line:90%
Okay, so let's go back in time.

00:01:55.049 --> 00:02:00.120 align:middle line:84%
1984 is when Pluto and
Scorpio really begins to hit.

00:02:00.120 --> 00:02:02.289 align:middle line:84%
Had a little bit of a
brief flirtation in '83,

00:02:02.289 --> 00:02:07.328 align:middle line:84%
went back into Pluto and
Virgo and '84 comes in strong.

00:02:07.328 --> 00:02:13.701 align:middle line:84%
And that generation is the
first generation that is --

00:02:13.701 --> 00:02:17.437 align:middle line:84%
I'm probably going to get a
lot of criticism for this.

00:02:17.437 --> 00:02:20.007 align:middle line:84%
They're the first generation
that's raised on rap music.

00:02:20.007 --> 00:02:20.841 align:middle line:90%
>> RM: Yeah.

00:02:20.841 --> 00:02:21.675 align:middle line:90%
>> RP: And hip-hop in a big way.

00:02:21.675 --> 00:02:23.010 align:middle line:90%
It's their rock and roll, right?

00:02:23.010 --> 00:02:24.178 align:middle line:90%
>> RM: Mm-hmm.

00:02:24.178 --> 00:02:26.647 align:middle line:84%
>> RP: And the first
group that really comes

00:02:26.647 --> 00:02:29.216 align:middle line:90%
onto the scene is Run DMC.

00:02:29.216 --> 00:02:32.753 align:middle line:84%
And there had been a
few other, you know,

00:02:32.753 --> 00:02:34.187 align:middle line:90%
rap artists prior to that.

00:02:34.187 --> 00:02:36.790 align:middle line:90%
Curtis Blow and Sugar Hill Gang.

00:02:36.790 --> 00:02:40.394 align:middle line:84%
And most of the rhymes
at that time were very --

00:02:40.394 --> 00:02:42.363 align:middle line:90%
pretty happy in some ways.

00:02:42.363 --> 00:02:44.231 align:middle line:84%
But by the way, I don't
know if you know this

00:02:44.231 --> 00:02:45.633 align:middle line:90%
or people out there know this.

00:02:45.633 --> 00:02:49.169 align:middle line:84%
The birth of rap -- really one
of the key events in the birth

00:02:49.169 --> 00:02:51.872 align:middle line:84%
of rap is the blackout
in New York City.

00:02:51.872 --> 00:02:52.907 align:middle line:90%
Do you remember that?

00:02:52.907 --> 00:02:53.607 align:middle line:90%
>> RM: Yes.

00:02:53.607 --> 00:02:54.308 align:middle line:90%
>> RP: The big blackout?

00:02:54.308 --> 00:02:55.675 align:middle line:90%
Well, one of the things

00:02:55.675 --> 00:02:57.544 align:middle line:84%
that happened during the big
blackout is that stereo stores

00:02:57.544 --> 00:03:01.382 align:middle line:84%
and pawn shops got broken
into and all these turntables

00:03:01.382 --> 00:03:04.885 align:middle line:84%
and all these sound systems
got liberated during the...

00:03:04.885 --> 00:03:05.552 align:middle line:90%
>> RM: [Laughter].

00:03:05.552 --> 00:03:06.620 align:middle line:90%
>> RP: I'm serious.

00:03:06.620 --> 00:03:07.621 align:middle line:84%
>> RM: And then became
that err err err.

00:03:07.621 --> 00:03:08.822 align:middle line:84%
>> RP: Yeah, and
became the wikki wikki.

00:03:08.822 --> 00:03:10.024 align:middle line:90%
>> RM: Yeah, yeah.

00:03:10.024 --> 00:03:12.559 align:middle line:84%
>> RP: So thank you David
Dinkins and the blackout

00:03:12.559 --> 00:03:15.396 align:middle line:84%
in New York City for
helping launch hip-hop.

00:03:15.396 --> 00:03:16.797 align:middle line:90%
So...

00:03:16.797 --> 00:03:19.633 align:middle line:84%
>> RM: Because turntables became
freely and easily accessible.

00:03:19.633 --> 00:03:20.934 align:middle line:90%
>> RP: Absolutely.

00:03:20.934 --> 00:03:22.670 align:middle line:84%
I mean, prior to that, it
was very hard for people to,

00:03:22.670 --> 00:03:24.038 align:middle line:90%
you know, buy these things.

00:03:24.038 --> 00:03:26.907 align:middle line:84%
And -- so anyway, it's
an interesting little

00:03:26.907 --> 00:03:28.309 align:middle line:90%
side [inaudible].

00:03:28.309 --> 00:03:31.779 align:middle line:84%
But the first wave of hip-hop
is actually fairly innocuous.

00:03:31.779 --> 00:03:33.447 align:middle line:90%
It's generally happy-go-lucky.

00:03:33.447 --> 00:03:35.582 align:middle line:84%
It's "Hey, I'm good
looking," you know,

00:03:35.582 --> 00:03:37.251 align:middle line:90%
"Come check me out, I'm fine."

00:03:37.251 --> 00:03:38.619 align:middle line:90%
You know, things like that.

00:03:38.619 --> 00:03:42.690 align:middle line:84%
And it's a little bit boastful
and there may be pokes here

00:03:42.690 --> 00:03:44.058 align:middle line:90%
and there at somebody else.

00:03:44.058 --> 00:03:46.627 align:middle line:84%
It's all based on
the dozens, right?

00:03:46.627 --> 00:03:49.463 align:middle line:84%
So it's kind - it's
-- it's not heavy.

00:03:49.463 --> 00:03:51.365 align:middle line:90%
It's not a heavy experience.

00:03:51.365 --> 00:03:55.836 align:middle line:84%
Run DMC comes onto the scene
and they're very interesting

00:03:55.836 --> 00:04:00.474 align:middle line:84%
because they are this bridge,
symbolically, between rock

00:04:00.474 --> 00:04:04.211 align:middle line:84%
and roll and hip-hop and they
have a video with Aerosmith,

00:04:04.211 --> 00:04:10.384 align:middle line:84%
that Aerosmith does with them,
and Aerosmith does a remix

00:04:10.384 --> 00:04:12.152 align:middle line:90%
of one of their songs, right?

00:04:12.152 --> 00:04:15.055 align:middle line:84%
And Run DMC comes in
and starts the hip-hop.

00:04:15.055 --> 00:04:18.324 align:middle line:84%
This is a very interesting,
symbolic moment  MTV  begins

00:04:18.324 --> 00:04:20.060 align:middle line:90%
to play -- begins to play,

00:04:20.060 --> 00:04:22.596 align:middle line:84%
slowly at that time,
hip-hop music.

00:04:22.596 --> 00:04:23.997 align:middle line:90%
It's a little bit at the time.

00:04:23.997 --> 00:04:28.035 align:middle line:84%
It's very -- Michael Jackson is
really the cultural influence.

00:04:28.035 --> 00:04:30.804 align:middle line:84%
But they're the first generation
that's raised with hip-hop.

00:04:30.804 --> 00:04:36.810 align:middle line:84%
So if we go back in time, 1984,
we fast forward, we go to 1990,

00:04:36.810 --> 00:04:40.247 align:middle line:84%
1991, hip-hop is
very, very different.

00:04:40.247 --> 00:04:43.217 align:middle line:84%
You have Public Enemy
and Public Enemy has a

00:04:43.217 --> 00:04:45.119 align:middle line:90%
political consciousness.

00:04:45.119 --> 00:04:48.856 align:middle line:84%
And then you have a group out
of Los Angeles called NWA.

00:04:48.856 --> 00:04:52.760 align:middle line:84%
And I was used -- I used to
be in the music business.

00:04:52.760 --> 00:04:54.962 align:middle line:84%
That was part of
my stock and trade.

00:04:54.962 --> 00:04:58.766 align:middle line:84%
And I remember flying
across the Atlantic one day,

00:04:58.766 --> 00:05:02.469 align:middle line:84%
going to a music show -- a
music seminar, trade show,

00:05:02.469 --> 00:05:06.040 align:middle line:84%
and I sat next to a
young hip-hop broadcaster

00:05:06.040 --> 00:05:08.175 align:middle line:84%
who knew the history of
hip-hop right and left.

00:05:08.175 --> 00:05:09.676 align:middle line:90%
And, you know, he was really --

00:05:09.676 --> 00:05:12.679 align:middle line:84%
he was a Pluto and
Scorpio kid and very cool.

00:05:12.679 --> 00:05:14.181 align:middle line:90%
I mean, he knew his stuff.

00:05:14.181 --> 00:05:17.418 align:middle line:84%
And he told me --
corroborated what I had heard

00:05:17.418 --> 00:05:20.954 align:middle line:84%
in the music business was that
there was a moment in time

00:05:20.954 --> 00:05:24.690 align:middle line:84%
where the record executives
had to make a choice.

00:05:24.690 --> 00:05:28.929 align:middle line:84%
And they had to make a choice
between Public Enemy or NWA.

00:05:28.929 --> 00:05:32.599 align:middle line:84%
Now Public Enemy was probably a
choice they didn't want to make

00:05:32.599 --> 00:05:33.734 align:middle line:90%
because Public Enemy was

00:05:33.734 --> 00:05:36.236 align:middle line:84%
about political consciousness
and awareness.

00:05:36.236 --> 00:05:37.938 align:middle line:84%
And once you let the cat out
of the bag with something

00:05:37.938 --> 00:05:40.340 align:middle line:84%
like that, you never know
where it's going to go.

00:05:40.340 --> 00:05:43.310 align:middle line:84%
And in fact, one of
Public Enemy's members,

00:05:43.310 --> 00:05:47.214 align:middle line:84%
Professor Griff, had been
taken out of the group

00:05:47.214 --> 00:05:50.350 align:middle line:90%
because he was critical of --

00:05:50.350 --> 00:05:54.521 align:middle line:84%
he was critical of the
Jewish record executives,

00:05:54.521 --> 00:05:55.889 align:middle line:84%
and he basically he said
everything [inaudible].

00:05:55.889 --> 00:05:56.890 align:middle line:84%
>> RM: Right, which
was prominent

00:05:56.890 --> 00:05:57.991 align:middle line:84%
in the record industry
and has been.

00:05:57.991 --> 00:05:58.525 align:middle line:90%
>> RP: Right.

00:05:58.525 --> 00:05:59.927 align:middle line:90%
>> RM: Yeah.

00:05:59.927 --> 00:06:01.195 align:middle line:84%
>> RP: So they took him out,
which was very interesting.

00:06:01.195 --> 00:06:02.629 align:middle line:84%
He was -- he was called their
minister of information.

00:06:02.629 --> 00:06:04.998 align:middle line:84%
And Public Enemy,
interestingly enough,

00:06:04.998 --> 00:06:07.668 align:middle line:84%
wasn't quite the
same after he left.

00:06:07.668 --> 00:06:10.337 align:middle line:84%
But there was a split
that took place

00:06:10.337 --> 00:06:13.107 align:middle line:84%
and the record industry
itself said, "Okay,

00:06:13.107 --> 00:06:14.708 align:middle line:84%
we're going to throw
down behind NWA

00:06:14.708 --> 00:06:18.612 align:middle line:84%
and NWA's message was really
anything but political.

00:06:18.612 --> 00:06:20.180 align:middle line:90%
I mean, they talked about --

00:06:20.180 --> 00:06:24.651 align:middle line:84%
and this is the group that had
Dr. Dre and Ice Cube and Easy E.

00:06:24.651 --> 00:06:27.020 align:middle line:84%
And they talked about being on
the mean streets of Compton.

00:06:27.020 --> 00:06:30.190 align:middle line:84%
A lot of those -- I mean, those
guys were not really gangsters.

00:06:30.190 --> 00:06:31.291 align:middle line:90%
They weren't.

00:06:31.291 --> 00:06:34.394 align:middle line:84%
I mean, they -- they
were posing as gangsters

00:06:34.394 --> 00:06:38.499 align:middle line:84%
and they were glorifying
this really dark life.

00:06:38.499 --> 00:06:42.469 align:middle line:84%
Now keep in mind that the kids
born in 1984, this is the Pluto

00:06:42.469 --> 00:06:45.172 align:middle line:84%
and Scorpio generation,
they're six, they're seven,

00:06:45.172 --> 00:06:47.474 align:middle line:84%
the music is being
played in their homes.

00:06:47.474 --> 00:06:48.742 align:middle line:90%
This is the beginning...

00:06:48.742 --> 00:06:50.944 align:middle line:84%
>> RM: It has a very hypnotic
type of beat, as well.

00:06:50.944 --> 00:06:51.778 align:middle line:90%
>> RP: Absolutely.

00:06:51.778 --> 00:06:52.412 align:middle line:90%
>> RM: There's a trance quality.

00:06:52.412 --> 00:06:53.247 align:middle line:90%
>> RP: Absolutely.

00:06:53.247 --> 00:06:55.716 align:middle line:90%
And the lyrics and the videos.

00:06:55.716 --> 00:06:58.318 align:middle line:84%
Now by this time,  MTV  is
starting to play videos.

00:06:58.318 --> 00:06:59.453 align:middle line:90%
>> RM: Right.

00:06:59.453 --> 00:07:00.954 align:middle line:84%
>> RP: They're starting
to play hip-hop videos,

00:07:00.954 --> 00:07:04.958 align:middle line:84%
Yo MTV Raps  is one of the
most popular shows on  MTV .

00:07:04.958 --> 00:07:08.262 align:middle line:84%
So this is the Pluto
and Scorpio kids.

00:07:08.262 --> 00:07:09.963 align:middle line:90%
This is their indoctrination.

00:07:09.963 --> 00:07:11.498 align:middle line:90%
This is their intensity.

00:07:11.498 --> 00:07:13.967 align:middle line:84%
They're coming of
age with this music.

00:07:13.967 --> 00:07:16.737 align:middle line:84%
Not only that, but
they're coming of age --

00:07:16.737 --> 00:07:20.774 align:middle line:90%
excuse me, in a time and place

00:07:20.774 --> 00:07:24.478 align:middle line:84%
where crack cocaine is
really prevalent, right?

00:07:24.478 --> 00:07:27.614 align:middle line:84%
I mean, it's exploding
throughout the inner city.

00:07:27.614 --> 00:07:29.182 align:middle line:84%
And not just the
inner city by the way.

00:07:29.182 --> 00:07:32.452 align:middle line:84%
Crack cocaine made
it into the suburbs.

00:07:32.452 --> 00:07:36.423 align:middle line:84%
I knew a number of people,
you know, who you would say,

00:07:36.423 --> 00:07:37.624 align:middle line:90%
"This guy's a crack addict?"

00:07:37.624 --> 00:07:38.659 align:middle line:90%
Yeah, he's a crack addict.

00:07:38.659 --> 00:07:39.726 align:middle line:84%
>> RM: Hey, and out
into the country,

00:07:39.726 --> 00:07:41.161 align:middle line:84%
I interviewed Catherine
Austin Fitch.

00:07:41.161 --> 00:07:43.196 align:middle line:84%
She said that's a
mainstay of the economy

00:07:43.196 --> 00:07:45.098 align:middle line:84%
out where she lives
in Tennessee even.

00:07:45.098 --> 00:07:46.500 align:middle line:90%
>> RP: Yeah.

00:07:46.500 --> 00:07:49.870 align:middle line:84%
Yeah. So, this is -- this is the
milieu that they're raised in.

00:07:49.870 --> 00:07:55.842 align:middle line:84%
It's a very different kind of
world, imagistically, sonically,

00:07:55.842 --> 00:07:58.745 align:middle line:84%
and even in terms
of their own --

00:07:58.745 --> 00:08:01.515 align:middle line:84%
in many cases, their own
neighborhoods and homes.

00:08:01.515 --> 00:08:05.953 align:middle line:84%
It's a very intense
and kind of dark phase.

00:08:05.953 --> 00:08:06.987 align:middle line:90%
>> RM: Yeah.

00:08:06.987 --> 00:08:08.288 align:middle line:84%
And then with the
original intention,

00:08:08.288 --> 00:08:10.057 align:middle line:84%
I interviewed Hank Shockley,
who was the producer of...

00:08:10.057 --> 00:08:10.724 align:middle line:90%
>> RP: Oh, you did?

00:08:10.724 --> 00:08:12.025 align:middle line:90%
>> RM: Public Enemy.

00:08:12.025 --> 00:08:14.161 align:middle line:90%
And he -- he was saying --

00:08:14.161 --> 00:08:17.664 align:middle line:84%
he's a really lit up guy who's
starting his own music network

00:08:17.664 --> 00:08:18.765 align:middle line:90%
in fact.

00:08:18.765 --> 00:08:20.767 align:middle line:84%
He said, I did this
because I couldn't --

00:08:20.767 --> 00:08:25.038 align:middle line:84%
this was the only way we could
get kids to start thinking

00:08:25.038 --> 00:08:28.141 align:middle line:84%
about their own place in the
world and power and starting

00:08:28.141 --> 00:08:30.577 align:middle line:84%
to question authority,
really question it.

00:08:30.577 --> 00:08:31.712 align:middle line:90%
>> RP: Yeah.

00:08:31.712 --> 00:08:33.013 align:middle line:84%
>> RM: So he did it for
reasons that he wanted

00:08:33.013 --> 00:08:37.751 align:middle line:84%
to empower the educational
base of the Black community,

00:08:37.751 --> 00:08:38.618 align:middle line:90%
which was interesting.

00:08:38.618 --> 00:08:39.652 align:middle line:90%
>> RP: Absolutely.

00:08:39.652 --> 00:08:42.189 align:middle line:84%
And there was a lot
of that happening

00:08:42.189 --> 00:08:44.023 align:middle line:90%
in New York at that time.

00:08:44.023 --> 00:08:45.359 align:middle line:90%
You had [inaudible].

00:08:45.359 --> 00:08:47.894 align:middle line:84%
I mean, there was a lot of
consciousness and a lot of --

00:08:47.894 --> 00:08:50.597 align:middle line:84%
in fact, Jay-Z actually
kind of comes out of that.

00:08:50.597 --> 00:08:51.999 align:middle line:90%
We'll talk about Jay-Z.

00:08:51.999 --> 00:08:55.502 align:middle line:84%
He's actually a very important
figure for Pluto and Scorpio,

00:08:55.502 --> 00:09:01.274 align:middle line:84%
both imagistically, and in terms
of his own star power and icon.

00:09:01.274 --> 00:09:02.676 align:middle line:90%
You want to talk about him now?

00:09:02.676 --> 00:09:03.543 align:middle line:90%
>> RM: Please do, yeah.

00:09:03.543 --> 00:09:04.878 align:middle line:90%
>> RP: Okay.

00:09:04.878 --> 00:09:09.349 align:middle line:84%
So Jay-Z, aka Shawn Carter,
is an interesting character.

00:09:09.349 --> 00:09:10.450 align:middle line:90%
>> RM: Mm-hmm.

00:09:10.450 --> 00:09:13.587 align:middle line:84%
>> RP: And I have --
I'm going to come right

00:09:13.587 --> 00:09:14.988 align:middle line:90%
and out and be honest.

00:09:14.988 --> 00:09:20.727 align:middle line:84%
I'm not a huge fan, because I
think his message is distorted.

00:09:20.727 --> 00:09:23.830 align:middle line:84%
I think -- I'm more in
the camp of Public Enemy,

00:09:23.830 --> 00:09:26.500 align:middle line:84%
underground hip-hop,
which is about, you know,

00:09:26.500 --> 00:09:28.735 align:middle line:90%
awareness and consciousness.

00:09:28.735 --> 00:09:29.870 align:middle line:90%
>> RM: The system is corrupt.

00:09:29.870 --> 00:09:30.537 align:middle line:90%
Take it back.

00:09:30.537 --> 00:09:31.905 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:09:31.905 --> 00:09:33.206 align:middle line:84%
>> RP: Take it back, but also,
I mean, if you go into some

00:09:33.206 --> 00:09:35.142 align:middle line:84%
of the underground
hip-hop artists, I mean,

00:09:35.142 --> 00:09:37.310 align:middle line:90%
there's a spirit of love there.

00:09:37.310 --> 00:09:38.679 align:middle line:90%
>> RM: Yes.

00:09:38.679 --> 00:09:42.949 align:middle line:84%
>> RP: And I don't feel the
spirit of love in Jay-Z's music.

00:09:42.949 --> 00:09:47.954 align:middle line:84%
It's patently material, and it's
about what I can get, you know,

00:09:47.954 --> 00:09:50.991 align:middle line:84%
what I can do, what's
important to me.

00:09:50.991 --> 00:09:53.160 align:middle line:84%
These are the images,
these are the icons,

00:09:53.160 --> 00:09:56.196 align:middle line:84%
these are the elements
that support my identity.

00:09:56.196 --> 00:09:57.731 align:middle line:90%
And boy isn't my life great?

00:09:57.731 --> 00:09:59.866 align:middle line:84%
And you know, your life can
be like my life, too, right?

00:09:59.866 --> 00:10:02.302 align:middle line:90%
I mean, but really it's my life.

00:10:02.302 --> 00:10:06.106 align:middle line:84%
So you know, just you
know, groove on this.

00:10:06.106 --> 00:10:08.141 align:middle line:90%
I think it's the wrong message.

00:10:08.141 --> 00:10:10.911 align:middle line:84%
And people mistake
that for empowerment.

00:10:10.911 --> 00:10:13.380 align:middle line:84%
You know, they see it as being
-- and I know people, you know,

00:10:13.380 --> 00:10:16.450 align:middle line:84%
in the Black community, who
love Jay-Z because they think

00:10:16.450 --> 00:10:18.919 align:middle line:84%
that he represents some
form of empowerment.

00:10:18.919 --> 00:10:19.986 align:middle line:90%
And I don't -- I don't...

00:10:19.986 --> 00:10:21.021 align:middle line:84%
>> RM: It's kind of
a false empowerment.

00:10:21.021 --> 00:10:21.955 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:10:21.955 --> 00:10:23.323 align:middle line:84%
>> RP: It is a false
empowerment.

00:10:23.323 --> 00:10:27.094 align:middle line:84%
I mean, to me, it smacks of
a kind of hollow materialism.

00:10:27.094 --> 00:10:31.398 align:middle line:84%
Jay-Z has surrounded himself, by
the way, with esoteric symbols.

00:10:31.398 --> 00:10:35.569 align:middle line:84%
He is -- his Rocawear Company,
his fashion wear company.

00:10:35.569 --> 00:10:38.338 align:middle line:84%
I think it was probably
about five or six years ago,

00:10:38.338 --> 00:10:41.775 align:middle line:84%
really got into printing
aluminous,

00:10:41.775 --> 00:10:45.011 align:middle line:84%
free masonic symbols
on their t-shirts.

00:10:45.011 --> 00:10:46.947 align:middle line:84%
Now this was intentional,
by the way.

00:10:46.947 --> 00:10:48.715 align:middle line:84%
>> RM: Yeah, I was going
to say, there's a history

00:10:48.715 --> 00:10:51.852 align:middle line:84%
of that going back
a few decades even.

00:10:51.852 --> 00:10:53.253 align:middle line:90%
>> RP: Yes.

00:10:53.253 --> 00:10:54.755 align:middle line:84%
>> RM: Of that at the base of
what's going on with the release

00:10:54.755 --> 00:10:58.058 align:middle line:84%
of certain groups, certain
dates their music is released.

00:10:58.058 --> 00:10:58.759 align:middle line:90%
>> RP: Absolutely.

00:10:58.759 --> 00:10:59.392 align:middle line:90%
>> RM: Deeply involved.

00:10:59.392 --> 00:11:00.761 align:middle line:90%
>> RP: Absolutely.

00:11:00.761 --> 00:11:03.497 align:middle line:84%
But now it became -- it's
become a fashion statement.

00:11:03.497 --> 00:11:07.033 align:middle line:84%
It's like Aleister Crowley
became a fashion statement

00:11:07.033 --> 00:11:10.470 align:middle line:84%
for these kids -- the
Pluto and Scorpio kids.

00:11:10.470 --> 00:11:15.609 align:middle line:84%
There's a young hip-hop artist
in LA named Tyler the Creator

00:11:15.609 --> 00:11:19.146 align:middle line:84%
who is part of a group
called Odd Futures.

00:11:19.146 --> 00:11:22.816 align:middle line:84%
And it's a very -- their
music is extremely,

00:11:22.816 --> 00:11:25.819 align:middle line:90%
extremely dark and very macabre.

00:11:25.819 --> 00:11:28.388 align:middle line:84%
You know, when we did
dark music like --

00:11:28.388 --> 00:11:30.457 align:middle line:84%
I'm in the Neptune in
Scorpio generation.

00:11:30.457 --> 00:11:33.126 align:middle line:84%
When we did dark music
like gothic music--

00:11:33.126 --> 00:11:36.263 align:middle line:84%
like Goth rock was part
of my generation, right,

00:11:36.263 --> 00:11:39.900 align:middle line:84%
there was a hint at times of
tongue-in-cheekiness, right?

00:11:39.900 --> 00:11:42.469 align:middle line:90%
Like, what's the movie?

00:11:42.469 --> 00:11:46.072 align:middle line:90%
I'm sorry -- Tim Curry.

00:11:46.072 --> 00:11:46.907 align:middle line:90%
Rocky Horror Picture Show.

00:11:46.907 --> 00:11:48.241 align:middle line:90%
>> RM: Yes.

00:11:48.241 --> 00:11:50.043 align:middle line:84%
>> RP: It's Goth but it's sort
of tongue-in-cheek, right?

00:11:50.043 --> 00:11:50.811 align:middle line:90%
>> RM: Right.

00:11:50.811 --> 00:11:51.912 align:middle line:90%
It's poking fun at itself.

00:11:51.912 --> 00:11:54.314 align:middle line:84%
>> RP: You go to -- you
go to a scary movie,

00:11:54.314 --> 00:11:56.383 align:middle line:84%
but there's some goofy
moments, too, right?

00:11:56.383 --> 00:11:57.584 align:middle line:90%
>> RM: Yeah.

00:11:57.584 --> 00:11:58.752 align:middle line:84%
>> RP: And you know, we
had bands like 66 Sputnik

00:11:58.752 --> 00:12:00.787 align:middle line:84%
who were laughable
in some ways, right?

00:12:00.787 --> 00:12:02.789 align:middle line:90%
But that's not this generation.

00:12:02.789 --> 00:12:04.724 align:middle line:84%
>> RM: There's almost
a demonic quality.

00:12:04.724 --> 00:12:06.860 align:middle line:84%
>> RP: There is a very
demonic quality to it.

00:12:06.860 --> 00:12:09.429 align:middle line:84%
And that's part of
this whole Pluto

00:12:09.429 --> 00:12:13.133 align:middle line:84%
and Scorpio sort
of cultural signal.

00:12:13.133 --> 00:12:16.870 align:middle line:84%
And if -- we have
to understand Pluto.

00:12:16.870 --> 00:12:22.209 align:middle line:84%
We have to know Scorpio, really,
where it exists in the --

00:12:22.209 --> 00:12:24.644 align:middle line:84%
in the evolution of
the wheel, right?

00:12:24.644 --> 00:12:29.115 align:middle line:84%
If you start at Aries, you start
at the most individual sign.

00:12:29.115 --> 00:12:30.717 align:middle line:90%
It's "I" you know, "I am."

00:12:30.717 --> 00:12:32.319 align:middle line:90%
That's what it is.

00:12:32.319 --> 00:12:34.788 align:middle line:84%
And you go all the way
around the wheel and you get

00:12:34.788 --> 00:12:38.692 align:middle line:84%
to the Libra and Libra's the
first sign where you begin

00:12:38.692 --> 00:12:40.594 align:middle line:84%
to think about other
people, right?

00:12:40.594 --> 00:12:42.696 align:middle line:84%
You begin to think about,
"Oh, I want to meet somebody."

00:12:42.696 --> 00:12:44.698 align:middle line:84%
You know, "I want
to get married."

00:12:44.698 --> 00:12:47.400 align:middle line:84%
You know, that's when the
individual consciousness begins

00:12:47.400 --> 00:12:49.436 align:middle line:90%
to embrace the other, right?

00:12:49.436 --> 00:12:52.739 align:middle line:84%
And if you -- if you go a
little bit further with that,

00:12:52.739 --> 00:12:56.576 align:middle line:84%
then you get into the whole like
psychic territory of what it's

00:12:56.576 --> 00:12:58.011 align:middle line:90%
like to be in a relationship.

00:12:58.011 --> 00:13:00.380 align:middle line:84%
Yeah, you fall in love,
but then what happens?

00:13:00.380 --> 00:13:03.416 align:middle line:84%
Then you go into these
very strange places.

00:13:03.416 --> 00:13:04.684 align:middle line:90%
Who am I? Who are you?

00:13:04.684 --> 00:13:06.052 align:middle line:90%
What's our life about?

00:13:06.052 --> 00:13:07.354 align:middle line:90%
You know, what's power?

00:13:07.354 --> 00:13:08.188 align:middle line:90%
You have power.

00:13:08.188 --> 00:13:09.055 align:middle line:90%
I have power.

00:13:09.055 --> 00:13:09.890 align:middle line:90%
We have sex.

00:13:09.890 --> 00:13:10.991 align:middle line:90%
We have baby.

00:13:10.991 --> 00:13:12.359 align:middle line:90%
Now you're into Scorpio.

00:13:12.359 --> 00:13:13.994 align:middle line:90%
That's -- that's what happens.

00:13:13.994 --> 00:13:15.762 align:middle line:90%
Once you hook up in Libra...

00:13:15.762 --> 00:13:16.863 align:middle line:90%
>> RM: You end up in Scorpio.

00:13:16.863 --> 00:13:18.698 align:middle line:84%
>> RP: You drop off
the continental shelf.

00:13:18.698 --> 00:13:20.867 align:middle line:84%
You go off into these
deep psychic realms.

00:13:20.867 --> 00:13:22.836 align:middle line:84%
And then you go into
therapy, right?

00:13:22.836 --> 00:13:23.970 align:middle line:90%
>> RM: [Laughter].

00:13:23.970 --> 00:13:25.438 align:middle line:84%
>> RP: I mean, that's --
so if you look at that,

00:13:25.438 --> 00:13:28.541 align:middle line:84%
Scorpio becomes the
first transpersonal sign.

00:13:28.541 --> 00:13:31.411 align:middle line:84%
And that's a really
important thing to understand,

00:13:31.411 --> 00:13:34.614 align:middle line:84%
because after that,
everything becomes --

00:13:34.614 --> 00:13:37.517 align:middle line:84%
in terms of astrology,
it becomes cultural.

00:13:37.517 --> 00:13:39.419 align:middle line:84%
From the first house
to the seventh house,

00:13:39.419 --> 00:13:40.687 align:middle line:90%
from Aries to Libra, it's all

00:13:40.687 --> 00:13:42.756 align:middle line:84%
about the development
of the individual.

00:13:42.756 --> 00:13:44.124 align:middle line:84%
And when we get to
the seventh house,

00:13:44.124 --> 00:13:46.259 align:middle line:90%
we're dropping into the psyche.

00:13:46.259 --> 00:13:47.827 align:middle line:84%
We're dropping into
the collective.

00:13:47.827 --> 00:13:51.731 align:middle line:84%
And if we look at Pluto
and Leo, Pluto and Virgo,

00:13:51.731 --> 00:13:55.168 align:middle line:84%
Pluto and Libra, these are
all pretty much individually

00:13:55.168 --> 00:13:57.170 align:middle line:90%
based generations.

00:13:57.170 --> 00:13:58.438 align:middle line:90%
Pluto and Leo.

00:13:58.438 --> 00:14:00.473 align:middle line:84%
I'm going to -- you know,
I'm going to be president.

00:14:00.473 --> 00:14:01.608 align:middle line:90%
>> RM: The Me Generation, yeah.

00:14:01.608 --> 00:14:02.309 align:middle line:84%
>> RP: I'm going to be
Bill Clinton, all right?

00:14:02.309 --> 00:14:03.043 align:middle line:90%
>> RM: Yeah.

00:14:03.043 --> 00:14:03.977 align:middle line:90%
>> RP: Pluto and Virgo.

00:14:03.977 --> 00:14:05.612 align:middle line:84%
Oh, you can do anything
you want.

00:14:05.612 --> 00:14:06.947 align:middle line:90%
Work has meaning.

00:14:06.947 --> 00:14:09.082 align:middle line:84%
You know, you can be
anything you want, right?

00:14:09.082 --> 00:14:10.717 align:middle line:84%
Pluto and Libra, a
little bit different.

00:14:10.717 --> 00:14:13.486 align:middle line:84%
They're -- they're looking
to mend the relationship --

00:14:13.486 --> 00:14:15.989 align:middle line:84%
the broken relationships
of their mother and father,

00:14:15.989 --> 00:14:17.590 align:middle line:84%
but also find beauty
in the world.

00:14:17.590 --> 00:14:19.426 align:middle line:90%
That's what they're here to do.

00:14:19.426 --> 00:14:21.795 align:middle line:84%
Pluto and Scorpio is
very, very different.

00:14:21.795 --> 00:14:24.664 align:middle line:84%
They're almost like the
village of the damned, really.

00:14:24.664 --> 00:14:27.267 align:middle line:84%
And I'm using this kind
of tongue-in-cheekish.

00:14:27.267 --> 00:14:28.535 align:middle line:90%
>> RM: Yeah.

00:14:28.535 --> 00:14:30.370 align:middle line:84%
>> RP: Because they are a
transpersonal generation.

00:14:30.370 --> 00:14:32.839 align:middle line:84%
They're the first transpersonal
generation we've had

00:14:32.839 --> 00:14:35.475 align:middle line:84%
on this planet in
quite a long time.

00:14:35.475 --> 00:14:36.810 align:middle line:90%
Keep that in mind.

00:14:36.810 --> 00:14:39.813 align:middle line:84%
I mean, we went from Pluto
and Cancer, Pluto and Gemini,

00:14:39.813 --> 00:14:42.082 align:middle line:84%
you know Pluto -- you
know, Pluto and Taurus.

00:14:42.082 --> 00:14:44.684 align:middle line:90%
This is going way back in time.

00:14:44.684 --> 00:14:47.520 align:middle line:84%
These kids represent a very
different kind of consciousness.

00:14:47.520 --> 00:14:50.290 align:middle line:84%
>> RM: When was the last
time Pluto was in Scorpio?

00:14:50.290 --> 00:14:52.125 align:middle line:84%
>> RP: You know, I was going to
look that up before [inaudible].

00:14:52.125 --> 00:14:53.493 align:middle line:84%
>> RM: Oh, that's okay
it's a long time ago.

00:14:53.493 --> 00:14:54.794 align:middle line:84%
>> RP: It is a long
time ago, yes.

00:14:54.794 --> 00:14:57.397 align:middle line:84%
But it's -- it's
been quite a while.

00:14:57.397 --> 00:15:01.101 align:middle line:84%
And in this country, it's
never happened before.

00:15:01.101 --> 00:15:01.635 align:middle line:90%
>> RM: Yes.

00:15:01.635 --> 00:15:02.769 align:middle line:90%
>> RP: Okay?

00:15:02.769 --> 00:15:03.703 align:middle line:84%
>> RM: And we are
talking hundreds of years.

00:15:03.703 --> 00:15:04.838 align:middle line:90%
>> RP: Right.

00:15:04.838 --> 00:15:06.206 align:middle line:84%
Exactly. This country
was founded with Pluto

00:15:06.206 --> 00:15:08.141 align:middle line:84%
in Capricorn, so
just do the math.

00:15:08.141 --> 00:15:08.641 align:middle line:90%
>> RM: Yeah.

00:15:08.641 --> 00:15:09.943 align:middle line:90%
Right.

00:15:09.943 --> 00:15:13.813 align:middle line:84%
>> RP: So anyway, these kids
are very, very different.

00:15:13.813 --> 00:15:17.183 align:middle line:84%
And they have a collective
sensibility

00:15:17.183 --> 00:15:19.519 align:middle line:84%
that I don't think
we can understand

00:15:19.519 --> 00:15:22.322 align:middle line:90%
from our position at all.

00:15:22.322 --> 00:15:26.426 align:middle line:84%
And the way that we can see this
is through the protest movement.

00:15:26.426 --> 00:15:32.766 align:middle line:84%
And they have this uncanny
ability to be able to organize

00:15:32.766 --> 00:15:35.602 align:middle line:90%
and assemble very quickly.

00:15:35.602 --> 00:15:40.340 align:middle line:84%
And if you look at places
like Egypt, and Turkey,

00:15:40.340 --> 00:15:43.443 align:middle line:84%
and even Brazil,
these demonstrations

00:15:43.443 --> 00:15:46.913 align:middle line:84%
and these protests, they're
all led by young people.

00:15:46.913 --> 00:15:48.548 align:middle line:84%
They're all pretty much
led by Pluto and Scorpio.

00:15:48.548 --> 00:15:49.682 align:middle line:90%
>> RM: And they're connected.

00:15:49.682 --> 00:15:51.284 align:middle line:84%
I mean, being connected
seems to be everything.

00:15:51.284 --> 00:15:52.452 align:middle line:90%
>> RP: They're very connected.

00:15:52.452 --> 00:15:55.588 align:middle line:90%
And they share similar values.

00:15:55.588 --> 00:15:56.723 align:middle line:90%
>> RM: Yes.

00:15:56.723 --> 00:15:58.792 align:middle line:84%
>> RP: And their values
are a lot more dramatic,

00:15:58.792 --> 00:16:01.094 align:middle line:90%
I think, than we understand.

00:16:01.094 --> 00:16:05.465 align:middle line:84%
They -- Scorpio is a
sign, it's a fixed sign.

00:16:05.465 --> 00:16:07.734 align:middle line:84%
There's not a lot of
gray area with Scorpio.

00:16:07.734 --> 00:16:09.836 align:middle line:90%
It's very black and white.

00:16:09.836 --> 00:16:12.272 align:middle line:84%
And Scorpios, when
they love you,

00:16:12.272 --> 00:16:14.441 align:middle line:84%
they really love you
and they're devoted.

00:16:14.441 --> 00:16:18.211 align:middle line:84%
And if they don't like you,
watch out because they will,

00:16:18.211 --> 00:16:19.512 align:middle line:90%
you know, they'll let you know

00:16:19.512 --> 00:16:22.582 align:middle line:84%
about it either overtly
or covertly.

00:16:22.582 --> 00:16:25.952 align:middle line:84%
And this generation has
that hard-wired into them.

00:16:25.952 --> 00:16:28.888 align:middle line:84%
So when they love something,
they will really love something.

00:16:28.888 --> 00:16:31.591 align:middle line:84%
And if they say, "No,
we don't like this,"

00:16:31.591 --> 00:16:34.794 align:middle line:90%
it is a resounding no.

00:16:34.794 --> 00:16:36.663 align:middle line:84%
And that's what shows
up in these --

00:16:36.663 --> 00:16:39.232 align:middle line:84%
in these protests and
these demonstrations.

00:16:39.232 --> 00:16:42.936 align:middle line:84%
And they're also really like
the first generation that's

00:16:42.936 --> 00:16:46.973 align:middle line:84%
like in some ways the
social media generation.

00:16:46.973 --> 00:16:48.875 align:middle line:84%
Growing up, you know,
towards the back end

00:16:48.875 --> 00:16:50.844 align:middle line:90%
with Facebook and Twitter.

00:16:50.844 --> 00:16:52.345 align:middle line:90%
So they know -- and cell phones.

00:16:52.345 --> 00:16:54.481 align:middle line:90%
They know this -- YouTube.

00:16:54.481 --> 00:16:58.017 align:middle line:90%
They know this media inside out.

00:16:58.017 --> 00:16:59.419 align:middle line:90%
They're very adept at it.

00:16:59.419 --> 00:17:03.056 align:middle line:84%
They communicate in ways that
we don't understand at times.

00:17:03.056 --> 00:17:06.426 align:middle line:84%
You know, they've got -- like
today, this was very funny.

00:17:06.426 --> 00:17:09.796 align:middle line:84%
We were talking in the
first show about --

00:17:09.796 --> 00:17:13.398 align:middle line:84%
about Pierce Morgan and the
interview with the witness,

00:17:13.398 --> 00:17:16.802 align:middle line:84%
Chantel, in the Trayvon
Martin case.

00:17:16.802 --> 00:17:19.839 align:middle line:84%
He's asking her about the
meaning of the word "Cracka."

00:17:19.839 --> 00:17:21.441 align:middle line:90%
Not cracker but cracka.

00:17:21.441 --> 00:17:22.242 align:middle line:90%
>> RM: Cracka

00:17:22.242 --> 00:17:22.774 align:middle line:90%
>> RP: You know, and it's...

00:17:22.774 --> 00:17:23.743 align:middle line:90%
>> RM: Yeah.

00:17:23.743 --> 00:17:25.845 align:middle line:84%
>> RP: It's hilarious
in one sense

00:17:25.845 --> 00:17:28.248 align:middle line:84%
and it's also very
strange in another sense.

00:17:28.248 --> 00:17:30.416 align:middle line:90%
Here we have a Pluto -- I'll bet

00:17:30.416 --> 00:17:32.819 align:middle line:84%
that Peirce Morgan
is Pluto and Leo.

00:17:32.819 --> 00:17:34.554 align:middle line:84%
Here we have a Pluto and
Leo and a potentially Pluto

00:17:34.554 --> 00:17:38.992 align:middle line:84%
and Scorpio kid talking about
this code and this difference

00:17:38.992 --> 00:17:43.029 align:middle line:84%
in language and the double
meaning behind Cracka,

00:17:43.029 --> 00:17:45.965 align:middle line:84%
because -- not Cracker
with an ER, but with an A.

00:17:45.965 --> 00:17:49.402 align:middle line:84%
And most people think, "Well,
cracker is a white guy, right?"

00:17:49.402 --> 00:17:50.637 align:middle line:90%
Well, she's saying, "No,

00:17:50.637 --> 00:17:54.174 align:middle line:84%
Cracka is a security
officer or a police officer."

00:17:54.174 --> 00:17:56.910 align:middle line:84%
So they're -- you know,
they're even taking the meaning

00:17:56.910 --> 00:17:57.477 align:middle line:90%
of the word...

00:17:57.477 --> 00:17:58.478 align:middle line:90%
>> RM: Right.

00:17:58.478 --> 00:17:59.779 align:middle line:84%
>> RP: ...that we
would agree upon.

00:17:59.779 --> 00:18:02.081 align:middle line:84%
And change that meaning,
changing the spelling.

00:18:02.081 --> 00:18:03.483 align:middle line:90%
>> RM: Making it more specific.

00:18:03.483 --> 00:18:07.387 align:middle line:84%
>> RP: Very specific and making
it their own experience, right?

00:18:07.387 --> 00:18:09.489 align:middle line:90%
So this is -- as a group are --

00:18:09.489 --> 00:18:12.826 align:middle line:84%
they're more psychically
attuned, I think,

00:18:12.826 --> 00:18:15.728 align:middle line:84%
than any other generation
prior to them.

00:18:15.728 --> 00:18:19.799 align:middle line:84%
And that can be a good
thing, but it can also be a,

00:18:19.799 --> 00:18:21.534 align:middle line:90%
potentially, not so good thing.

00:18:21.534 --> 00:18:22.368 align:middle line:90%
>> RM: Okay.

00:18:22.368 --> 00:18:24.037 align:middle line:90%
On that note, I have a question.

00:18:24.037 --> 00:18:25.038 align:middle line:90%
Now when you look at the --

00:18:25.038 --> 00:18:27.307 align:middle line:84%
at kind of the esoteric
end of Scorpio,

00:18:27.307 --> 00:18:29.442 align:middle line:90%
it supposedly has two faces.

00:18:29.442 --> 00:18:31.311 align:middle line:84%
One is the scorpion
and one is the eagle.

00:18:31.311 --> 00:18:32.412 align:middle line:90%
So it has potential...

00:18:32.412 --> 00:18:33.446 align:middle line:90%
>> RP: Absolutely.

00:18:33.446 --> 00:18:34.781 align:middle line:84%
>> RM: For high and
transformative...

00:18:34.781 --> 00:18:36.482 align:middle line:90%
>> RP: Absolutely.

00:18:36.482 --> 00:18:37.150 align:middle line:90%
>> RM: So, yeah.

00:18:37.150 --> 00:18:38.351 align:middle line:90%
How does that jive?

00:18:38.351 --> 00:18:39.185 align:middle line:90%
>> RP: Well, so...

00:18:39.185 --> 00:18:40.587 align:middle line:90%
>> RM: It's so extreme itself.

00:18:40.587 --> 00:18:41.921 align:middle line:90%
>> RP: Right.

00:18:41.921 --> 00:18:44.724 align:middle line:84%
I mean, I -- so I think this
generation really can either

00:18:44.724 --> 00:18:46.626 align:middle line:90%
save the planet or burn it down.

00:18:46.626 --> 00:18:47.527 align:middle line:90%
That's what I think.

00:18:47.527 --> 00:18:49.062 align:middle line:90%
And that's the -- that's the --

00:18:49.062 --> 00:18:51.831 align:middle line:84%
and right now, some
of them are going

00:18:51.831 --> 00:18:54.400 align:middle line:90%
through their Saturn return.

00:18:54.400 --> 00:18:57.870 align:middle line:84%
Like, the kind of the,
the 28 to 30 group...

00:18:57.870 --> 00:18:58.972 align:middle line:90%
>> RM: Yes.

00:18:58.972 --> 00:19:00.106 align:middle line:84%
>> RP: Is going through
their Saturn return.

00:19:00.106 --> 00:19:01.474 align:middle line:84%
And then there's a
younger group that will go

00:19:01.474 --> 00:19:03.476 align:middle line:84%
through Saturn return with
Saturn and Sagittarius

00:19:03.476 --> 00:19:04.978 align:middle line:90%
which is a little bit different.

00:19:04.978 --> 00:19:06.079 align:middle line:90%
So they're going through --

00:19:06.079 --> 00:19:09.282 align:middle line:84%
Saturn is hitting all
of their generation

00:19:09.282 --> 00:19:10.450 align:middle line:90%
at this point in time.

00:19:10.450 --> 00:19:11.751 align:middle line:84%
So they all have
Pluto and Scorpio

00:19:11.751 --> 00:19:12.952 align:middle line:84%
and Saturn is moving
through that sign.

00:19:12.952 --> 00:19:14.721 align:middle line:90%
It's at five degrees now.

00:19:14.721 --> 00:19:17.223 align:middle line:84%
So they're all going to be
hit by Saturn over the course

00:19:17.223 --> 00:19:18.725 align:middle line:90%
of the next two years.

00:19:18.725 --> 00:19:19.859 align:middle line:90%
And...

00:19:19.859 --> 00:19:20.727 align:middle line:84%
>> RM: It's kind of like
a double whammy, right?

00:19:20.727 --> 00:19:21.961 align:middle line:90%
>> RP: It is a double whammy.

00:19:21.961 --> 00:19:24.430 align:middle line:84%
And they're either going
to step up during this time

00:19:24.430 --> 00:19:26.666 align:middle line:90%
and really come online,

00:19:26.666 --> 00:19:30.336 align:middle line:84%
or they're going to
be hard to handle.

00:19:30.336 --> 00:19:35.775 align:middle line:84%
And I think there's also -- you
know, I don't want traffic in,

00:19:35.775 --> 00:19:36.976 align:middle line:90%
you know, doom and gloom.

00:19:36.976 --> 00:19:39.445 align:middle line:84%
That's not what, you
know, I'm really into.

00:19:39.445 --> 00:19:42.682 align:middle line:84%
But I've been seeing for a
while that there's the potential

00:19:42.682 --> 00:19:47.954 align:middle line:84%
for some larger numbers of
casualties or afflictions

00:19:47.954 --> 00:19:52.191 align:middle line:84%
with this generation with Saturn
and Scorpio hitting their Pluto,

00:19:52.191 --> 00:19:54.160 align:middle line:84%
especially as it
relates to sexuality.

00:19:54.160 --> 00:19:56.296 align:middle line:84%
They're a very sexual
generation,

00:19:56.296 --> 00:19:58.031 align:middle line:90%
extremely sexual generation.

00:19:58.031 --> 00:19:59.966 align:middle line:84%
>> RM: Is that why you call
them Generation Triple X?

00:19:59.966 --> 00:20:00.800 align:middle line:90%
>> RP: Absolutely.

00:20:00.800 --> 00:20:01.801 align:middle line:90%
>> RM: Instead of Generation Y

00:20:01.801 --> 00:20:02.869 align:middle line:84%
which is what they're
normally called.

00:20:02.869 --> 00:20:03.903 align:middle line:90%
>> RP: Right.

00:20:03.903 --> 00:20:04.871 align:middle line:84%
Generation Triple
X. They're hardcore.

00:20:04.871 --> 00:20:06.806 align:middle line:90%
This is a hardcore generation.

00:20:06.806 --> 00:20:09.075 align:middle line:84%
>> RM: But that means that
something has happened

00:20:09.075 --> 00:20:12.045 align:middle line:84%
where they've been cut
off from the more kind

00:20:12.045 --> 00:20:15.381 align:middle line:84%
of delicate sensibilities of
the connection with the soul.

00:20:15.381 --> 00:20:17.884 align:middle line:84%
Something's been truncated
to create, as you say,

00:20:17.884 --> 00:20:22.221 align:middle line:84%
this hardcore sexually, but in
many, many other ways as well.

00:20:22.221 --> 00:20:22.755 align:middle line:90%
>> RP: Yeah.

00:20:22.755 --> 00:20:23.890 align:middle line:90%
I think so.

00:20:23.890 --> 00:20:25.792 align:middle line:84%
And I think, again, we
have to look at the --

00:20:25.792 --> 00:20:27.293 align:middle line:90%
the cultural influences...

00:20:27.293 --> 00:20:28.061 align:middle line:90%
>> RM: Yes.

00:20:28.061 --> 00:20:29.696 align:middle line:90%
>> RP: Of that generation.

00:20:29.696 --> 00:20:32.265 align:middle line:84%
And I'm not -- I'm not
demonizing hip-hop.

00:20:32.265 --> 00:20:34.567 align:middle line:84%
But I do think that there
are strains of hip-hop

00:20:34.567 --> 00:20:37.103 align:middle line:84%
that are extremely,
extremely dark.

00:20:37.103 --> 00:20:40.907 align:middle line:84%
And these are the --
this was the soundtrack

00:20:40.907 --> 00:20:42.709 align:middle line:90%
for a generation growing up.

00:20:42.709 --> 00:20:48.014 align:middle line:84%
And I think it's -- I think it's
impacted them on a deep level.

00:20:48.014 --> 00:20:49.248 align:middle line:90%
But it's not the only thing.

00:20:49.248 --> 00:20:50.750 align:middle line:84%
There are other things that
are part of [inaudible].

00:20:50.750 --> 00:20:52.785 align:middle line:84%
>> RM: Okay, if we look
at societal conditioning.

00:20:52.785 --> 00:20:53.653 align:middle line:90%
>> RP: Yeah.

00:20:53.653 --> 00:20:55.021 align:middle line:84%
>> RM: You know,
we're looking --

00:20:55.021 --> 00:20:57.590 align:middle line:84%
we talked a little bit about
[inaudible] on the last show.

00:20:57.590 --> 00:21:00.827 align:middle line:84%
That flat out brainwashing
of the public at large.

00:21:00.827 --> 00:21:01.961 align:middle line:90%
>> RP: Right.

00:21:01.961 --> 00:21:03.930 align:middle line:84%
>> RM: So that kind of
influence -- what is --

00:21:03.930 --> 00:21:06.099 align:middle line:84%
we can kind of look around
and see what that is,

00:21:06.099 --> 00:21:09.469 align:middle line:84%
but I'd like your take on
what the input to them is.

00:21:09.469 --> 00:21:11.137 align:middle line:84%
Not just rap music,
but beyond that.

00:21:11.137 --> 00:21:11.771 align:middle line:90%
>> RP: 9-11

00:21:11.771 --> 00:21:12.305 align:middle line:90%
>> RM: In films...

00:21:12.305 --> 00:21:13.239 align:middle line:90%
>> RP: 9-11.

00:21:13.239 --> 00:21:16.509 align:middle line:84%
They had to deal
with 9-11, right?

00:21:16.509 --> 00:21:23.816 align:middle line:84%
So if -- 1984 to 2001, so
what are we talking about?

00:21:23.816 --> 00:21:25.385 align:middle line:90%
They were 10 in '94.

00:21:25.385 --> 00:21:27.954 align:middle line:84%
So 17 would be the
first generation,

00:21:27.954 --> 00:21:30.223 align:middle line:90%
but there are younger, you know.

00:21:30.223 --> 00:21:33.559 align:middle line:84%
>> RM: They were like -- they
were like the Boomer Generation

00:21:33.559 --> 00:21:34.127 align:middle line:90%
when Kennedy was killed.

00:21:34.127 --> 00:21:34.694 align:middle line:90%
>> RP: Exactly.

00:21:34.694 --> 00:21:35.795 align:middle line:90%
>> RM: Same age.

00:21:35.795 --> 00:21:36.329 align:middle line:84%
>> RP: Which is what
we were talking about.

00:21:36.329 --> 00:21:37.397 align:middle line:90%
>> RM: Yeah.

00:21:37.397 --> 00:21:39.665 align:middle line:84%
>> RP: 9-11 is the
Kennedy moment for them.

00:21:39.665 --> 00:21:40.933 align:middle line:90%
>> RM: Right.

00:21:40.933 --> 00:21:42.668 align:middle line:84%
>> RP: And I think it's a
-- I wasn't a parent then,

00:21:42.668 --> 00:21:45.471 align:middle line:84%
but I can only imagine what it
was like to be a parent during

00:21:45.471 --> 00:21:48.307 align:middle line:84%
that time and have to
explain something like that.

00:21:48.307 --> 00:21:50.376 align:middle line:84%
It must have been
very difficult.

00:21:50.376 --> 00:21:54.447 align:middle line:84%
And more difficult if you
had some kind of insight

00:21:54.447 --> 00:21:55.615 align:middle line:84%
as to what might
have been happening.

00:21:55.615 --> 00:21:56.883 align:middle line:84%
>> RM: Yeah, well, that's
a whole other story.

00:21:56.883 --> 00:21:57.884 align:middle line:90%
>> RP: Exactly.

00:21:57.884 --> 00:21:58.751 align:middle line:84%
>> RM: What did it
do to their sense

00:21:58.751 --> 00:22:00.219 align:middle line:84%
of confidence in
life in general?

00:22:00.219 --> 00:22:01.621 align:middle line:90%
>> RP: Exactly.

00:22:01.621 --> 00:22:04.657 align:middle line:84%
I mean, this is a shattering
moment for this generation.

00:22:04.657 --> 00:22:07.693 align:middle line:84%
You know, this --
this is massive death.

00:22:07.693 --> 00:22:12.698 align:middle line:84%
This is the world that they had
been taught was safe and secure.

00:22:12.698 --> 00:22:14.700 align:middle line:90%
That's not there anymore.

00:22:14.700 --> 00:22:17.103 align:middle line:84%
This is an extremely
pivotal time I think

00:22:17.103 --> 00:22:18.438 align:middle line:90%
for their generation.

00:22:18.438 --> 00:22:24.377 align:middle line:84%
And -- and I also think because
they are a deeply psychic

00:22:24.377 --> 00:22:28.815 align:middle line:84%
generation, that they probably
on some level have intuited

00:22:28.815 --> 00:22:30.817 align:middle line:84%
that there's something
not right about this.

00:22:30.817 --> 00:22:31.350 align:middle line:90%
>> RM: Well, yeah.

00:22:31.350 --> 00:22:31.884 align:middle line:90%
Definitely.

00:22:31.884 --> 00:22:33.286 align:middle line:90%
>> RP: Yeah.

00:22:33.286 --> 00:22:34.754 align:middle line:84%
>> RM: When you talk to them,
it's like there's a part of them

00:22:34.754 --> 00:22:36.622 align:middle line:84%
that has just checked
out of the whole thing.

00:22:36.622 --> 00:22:38.024 align:middle line:90%
>> RP: That's right.

00:22:38.024 --> 00:22:40.960 align:middle line:84%
>> RM: They spend their time on
social media and on technology

00:22:40.960 --> 00:22:43.696 align:middle line:84%
with each other, but they don't
really seem to want to engage

00:22:43.696 --> 00:22:45.631 align:middle line:84%
with what's going
on on the outside.

00:22:45.631 --> 00:22:46.999 align:middle line:90%
And I can't blame them.

00:22:46.999 --> 00:22:47.567 align:middle line:90%
>> RP: Right.

00:22:47.567 --> 00:22:48.701 align:middle line:90%
Yeah, exactly.

00:22:48.701 --> 00:22:50.069 align:middle line:84%
Because it was a
traumatizing moment for them.

00:22:50.069 --> 00:22:51.070 align:middle line:90%
>> RM: Yeah.

00:22:51.070 --> 00:22:53.039 align:middle line:84%
>> RP: So what's
interesting though was

00:22:53.039 --> 00:22:56.576 align:middle line:84%
that Scorpio is the great
detective of the zodiac.

00:22:56.576 --> 00:22:57.643 align:middle line:90%
>> RM: Yes.

00:22:57.643 --> 00:23:00.513 align:middle line:84%
>> RP: So at some
point, these kids are --

00:23:00.513 --> 00:23:03.316 align:middle line:84%
they're going to wake up
and they're going to try

00:23:03.316 --> 00:23:05.852 align:middle line:90%
to figure out what's happened.

00:23:05.852 --> 00:23:06.953 align:middle line:90%
And I think that that's going

00:23:06.953 --> 00:23:08.821 align:middle line:84%
to be a very interesting
time for them.

00:23:08.821 --> 00:23:13.025 align:middle line:84%
And possibly, a very explosive
time for them, as well.

00:23:13.025 --> 00:23:15.962 align:middle line:84%
Now if you have continual
revolutions

00:23:15.962 --> 00:23:19.432 align:middle line:84%
or continual protests or
continual mass demonstrations,

00:23:19.432 --> 00:23:21.634 align:middle line:84%
you can kind of keep
them busy and occupied --

00:23:21.634 --> 00:23:23.669 align:middle line:90%
to coin the phrase, for a while.

00:23:23.669 --> 00:23:26.072 align:middle line:90%
But I think that once they --

00:23:26.072 --> 00:23:31.344 align:middle line:84%
once they peel back the layers
-- and Scorpio is very intense

00:23:31.344 --> 00:23:35.748 align:middle line:84%
and they can -- they can
zero right in as a generation

00:23:35.748 --> 00:23:39.652 align:middle line:84%
and figure this out and look
at it unflinchingly and say,

00:23:39.652 --> 00:23:42.889 align:middle line:84%
"This is wrong," or
"This happened this way,"

00:23:42.889 --> 00:23:45.992 align:middle line:90%
or "This is -- this is a lie."

00:23:45.992 --> 00:23:48.194 align:middle line:84%
Right? I mean, they
have that ability.

00:23:48.194 --> 00:23:50.496 align:middle line:84%
And that's where the
eagle can kick in.

00:23:50.496 --> 00:23:51.330 align:middle line:90%
We hope, right?

00:23:51.330 --> 00:23:52.231 align:middle line:90%
>> RM: Well, let's hope, yes.

00:23:52.231 --> 00:23:53.633 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:23:53.633 --> 00:23:54.934 align:middle line:84%
>> RP: We hope that the eagle
kicks in because now it's like,

00:23:54.934 --> 00:23:56.402 align:middle line:90%
okay, we have the vision.

00:23:56.402 --> 00:23:59.138 align:middle line:84%
What do we want to -- what do
we want to do with this vision.

00:23:59.138 --> 00:24:02.341 align:middle line:84%
>> RM: I mean, we're going
toward the center of the galaxy.

00:24:02.341 --> 00:24:05.978 align:middle line:84%
I mean, aren't we talking
about larger cosmic influences

00:24:05.978 --> 00:24:09.315 align:middle line:84%
that should really inspire
the eagle to rise out of that?

00:24:09.315 --> 00:24:09.815 align:middle line:90%
>> RP: Yeah.

00:24:09.815 --> 00:24:10.883 align:middle line:90%
I -- yeah.

00:24:10.883 --> 00:24:11.717 align:middle line:84%
>> RM: It's just the
social conditioning,

00:24:11.717 --> 00:24:13.719 align:middle line:90%
media conditioning, etcetera.

00:24:13.719 --> 00:24:16.889 align:middle line:84%
Right now, while they're young,
it seems that it's having a --

00:24:16.889 --> 00:24:19.625 align:middle line:90%
an inordinate amount of effect.

00:24:19.625 --> 00:24:20.459 align:middle line:90%
>> RP: Ah, yes.

00:24:20.459 --> 00:24:21.260 align:middle line:90%
Absolutely.

00:24:21.260 --> 00:24:24.430 align:middle line:90%
And -- and I think that --

00:24:24.430 --> 00:24:26.632 align:middle line:84%
there's a really interesting
football player named

00:24:26.632 --> 00:24:27.700 align:middle line:90%
Colin Kaepernick.

00:24:27.700 --> 00:24:30.002 align:middle line:84%
And he plays for the
San Francisco 49ers.

00:24:30.002 --> 00:24:31.470 align:middle line:90%
And he's a Scorpio.

00:24:31.470 --> 00:24:33.072 align:middle line:84%
And he also has Pluto
and Scorpio

00:24:33.072 --> 00:24:34.941 align:middle line:90%
and Pluto as conjunctive sun.

00:24:34.941 --> 00:24:37.977 align:middle line:90%
And it was really interesting.

00:24:37.977 --> 00:24:40.980 align:middle line:84%
Last year, I'm on this
football forum, right?

00:24:40.980 --> 00:24:44.350 align:middle line:84%
And I was doing Kaepernick's
astrology and I said

00:24:44.350 --> 00:24:48.220 align:middle line:84%
in this forum, I said, Alex
Smith who is his opposite sign,

00:24:48.220 --> 00:24:51.023 align:middle line:84%
Taurus -- this was in October
-- just before October.

00:24:51.023 --> 00:24:53.192 align:middle line:84%
I said, Alex Smith
is going to get hurt

00:24:53.192 --> 00:24:54.627 align:middle line:90%
in the middle of October.

00:24:54.627 --> 00:24:57.897 align:middle line:84%
Colin Kaepernick will
take over the starting job

00:24:57.897 --> 00:24:59.065 align:middle line:90%
and he will never look back.

00:24:59.065 --> 00:25:00.433 align:middle line:90%
And it happened.

00:25:00.433 --> 00:25:01.734 align:middle line:90%
And I was like, ah, that's cool.

00:25:01.734 --> 00:25:03.002 align:middle line:90%
>> RM: He's a genius!

00:25:03.002 --> 00:25:04.370 align:middle line:84%
>> RP: That's cool, I got
it right for once, right?

00:25:04.370 --> 00:25:07.573 align:middle line:84%
So I got it right and Kaepernick
has been really interesting

00:25:07.573 --> 00:25:12.478 align:middle line:84%
because he -- he's on the
cover of ESPN Magazine

00:25:12.478 --> 00:25:14.380 align:middle line:84%
and he's only been a
starting quarterback

00:25:14.380 --> 00:25:15.715 align:middle line:90%
in the NFL for nine games.

00:25:15.715 --> 00:25:19.085 align:middle line:84%
He's become a massively
iconic figure,

00:25:19.085 --> 00:25:21.454 align:middle line:84%
and in some ways a very
polarizing figure too

00:25:21.454 --> 00:25:23.689 align:middle line:84%
because Scorpio can
polarize, right?

00:25:23.689 --> 00:25:25.157 align:middle line:90%
It's black and white.

00:25:25.157 --> 00:25:30.262 align:middle line:84%
And ESPN is just now hitting
the stands with its body issue.

00:25:30.262 --> 00:25:33.399 align:middle line:84%
Sports Illustrated has
this swimsuit issue

00:25:33.399 --> 00:25:35.801 align:middle line:90%
and ESPN has the body issue,

00:25:35.801 --> 00:25:38.537 align:middle line:84%
which is very Scorpionic,
by the way, right?

00:25:38.537 --> 00:25:42.041 align:middle line:84%
And there's Kaepernick and
Kaepernick has an amazing body.

00:25:42.041 --> 00:25:47.213 align:middle line:84%
He's totally sculpted and
he's crouching on these rocks

00:25:47.213 --> 00:25:50.182 align:middle line:84%
and he's got this tattoo
coming down him and it's

00:25:50.182 --> 00:25:53.786 align:middle line:84%
like he's the first human
coming out of the water,

00:25:53.786 --> 00:25:56.856 align:middle line:84%
which is a very kind of
Scorpionic iconic moment, right?

00:25:56.856 --> 00:25:58.424 align:middle line:90%
It's very, very powerful.

00:25:58.424 --> 00:26:01.427 align:middle line:84%
But what's really interesting
is that he was wearing --

00:26:01.427 --> 00:26:04.330 align:middle line:84%
he was caught wearing
a Miami Dolphins cap

00:26:04.330 --> 00:26:06.499 align:middle line:90%
and he plays for the 49ers.

00:26:06.499 --> 00:26:07.967 align:middle line:84%
All these old school
people are saying,

00:26:07.967 --> 00:26:09.635 align:middle line:84%
"Why are you wearing
a Dolphins cap?

00:26:09.635 --> 00:26:11.037 align:middle line:90%
You play for the 9ers."

00:26:11.037 --> 00:26:13.339 align:middle line:84%
Well, what he was doing was he
was shirtless and he was trying

00:26:13.339 --> 00:26:18.144 align:middle line:84%
to match the teal of the cap
with his underwear, which was --

00:26:18.144 --> 00:26:19.879 align:middle line:84%
which is a very kind
of Scorpionic thing,

00:26:19.879 --> 00:26:22.381 align:middle line:84%
coming up out of
his shorts, right?

00:26:22.381 --> 00:26:26.118 align:middle line:84%
And he basically said, "I
don't care what you think."

00:26:26.118 --> 00:26:29.255 align:middle line:84%
You know? "I play hard,
I work hard, you know,

00:26:29.255 --> 00:26:31.190 align:middle line:90%
all I care about is what I do."

00:26:31.190 --> 00:26:36.495 align:middle line:84%
And this in some ways is a
motto for this generation.

00:26:36.495 --> 00:26:37.563 align:middle line:90%
They don't care.

00:26:37.563 --> 00:26:38.698 align:middle line:90%
They don't care what I think.

00:26:38.698 --> 00:26:40.032 align:middle line:90%
They don't care what you think.

00:26:40.032 --> 00:26:41.133 align:middle line:84%
They don't care what
anybody thinks.

00:26:41.133 --> 00:26:42.601 align:middle line:84%
They're going to do what
they're going to do.

00:26:42.601 --> 00:26:47.940 align:middle line:84%
And in some ways, we have to let
them go in order to experience

00:26:47.940 --> 00:26:50.876 align:middle line:84%
that and to understand
that, but they will go

00:26:50.876 --> 00:26:53.612 align:middle line:90%
through some very powerful

00:26:53.612 --> 00:26:56.415 align:middle line:84%
and transformative
experiences along the way.

00:26:56.415 --> 00:26:57.783 align:middle line:84%
>> RM: One of the
things I'm noticing --

00:26:57.783 --> 00:27:00.019 align:middle line:84%
and I do want to get back to
the Trayvon Martin story just

00:27:00.019 --> 00:27:03.656 align:middle line:84%
because of what it's doing
with their generation racially,

00:27:03.656 --> 00:27:06.158 align:middle line:84%
because it's really been a
period of total integration.

00:27:06.158 --> 00:27:08.661 align:middle line:90%
I mean, in the media certainly.

00:27:08.661 --> 00:27:09.695 align:middle line:90%
>> RP: Sure.

00:27:09.695 --> 00:27:11.397 align:middle line:84%
>> RM: But why don't
we go there first?

00:27:11.397 --> 00:27:12.398 align:middle line:90%
>> RP: Black and White.

00:27:12.398 --> 00:27:13.199 align:middle line:90%
Black and White.

00:27:13.199 --> 00:27:14.834 align:middle line:90%
Scorpio is black and white.

00:27:14.834 --> 00:27:16.368 align:middle line:84%
I mean, it's really
pretty simple.

00:27:16.368 --> 00:27:21.040 align:middle line:84%
And it's a divide and
conquer strategy and Pluto

00:27:21.040 --> 00:27:25.010 align:middle line:84%
and Scorpio tend to be
responding this on some level.

00:27:25.010 --> 00:27:28.214 align:middle line:84%
There is -- you know,
hopefully some of them will see

00:27:28.214 --> 00:27:33.919 align:middle line:84%
through this and understand that
there is a level of manipulation

00:27:33.919 --> 00:27:36.422 align:middle line:84%
that is taking place on
the collective level.

00:27:36.422 --> 00:27:37.256 align:middle line:90%
>> RM: Yes.

00:27:37.256 --> 00:27:38.591 align:middle line:90%
>> RP: And they can get there.

00:27:38.591 --> 00:27:42.328 align:middle line:84%
But in order for them to get
to that point, they're going

00:27:42.328 --> 00:27:44.497 align:middle line:84%
to have to go through
some of their anger

00:27:44.497 --> 00:27:46.065 align:middle line:90%
and some of their rage.

00:27:46.065 --> 00:27:48.300 align:middle line:90%
And that takes us back to 9-11.

00:27:48.300 --> 00:27:51.303 align:middle line:84%
That takes us back to how
they were brought up at times.

00:27:51.303 --> 00:27:55.207 align:middle line:84%
Maybe they were brought up in a
really shaky environment with,

00:27:55.207 --> 00:27:56.976 align:middle line:84%
you know, parents that
weren't there all the time.

00:27:56.976 --> 00:27:58.110 align:middle line:84%
>> RM: A lot of broken
homes, certainly.

00:27:58.110 --> 00:27:59.345 align:middle line:90%
>> RP: Yeah.

00:27:59.345 --> 00:28:01.514 align:middle line:84%
Exactly. So, you know,
they're going to have to go

00:28:01.514 --> 00:28:05.584 align:middle line:84%
through their own collective
reckoning around anger and rage.

00:28:05.584 --> 00:28:09.855 align:middle line:84%
I think every generation has
to do that in their own way,

00:28:09.855 --> 00:28:11.857 align:middle line:84%
because I think we're
all grieving, right?

00:28:11.857 --> 00:28:17.763 align:middle line:84%
I mean, we're all grieving on
some level due to whatever form

00:28:17.763 --> 00:28:20.199 align:middle line:84%
of separation we've experienced,
whether it's separation

00:28:20.199 --> 00:28:23.469 align:middle line:84%
from nature, or separation
from a parent, or separation --

00:28:23.469 --> 00:28:26.138 align:middle line:84%
the ultimate separation
from God, or the universe.

00:28:26.138 --> 00:28:27.573 align:middle line:90%
We're grieving for that.

00:28:27.573 --> 00:28:31.544 align:middle line:84%
But the level above grief is
anger, and we all go through it

00:28:31.544 --> 00:28:33.846 align:middle line:84%
and we all have to come
though it in our own way.

00:28:33.846 --> 00:28:37.349 align:middle line:84%
And I think they will as
well and I think right now,

00:28:37.349 --> 00:28:40.586 align:middle line:84%
with Saturn and Scorpio,
and Jupiter and Cancer,

00:28:40.586 --> 00:28:44.657 align:middle line:84%
this could be a very
therapeutic phase for them

00:28:44.657 --> 00:28:45.991 align:middle line:90%
as well as a potentially...

00:28:45.991 --> 00:28:46.792 align:middle line:90%
>> RM: Volatile.

00:28:46.792 --> 00:28:48.561 align:middle line:90%
>> RP: Volatile phase, too.

00:28:48.561 --> 00:28:51.363 align:middle line:84%
>> RM: One thing I'm seeing --
my son is right on the edge.

00:28:51.363 --> 00:28:52.865 align:middle line:90%
He just turned 31.

00:28:52.865 --> 00:28:53.799 align:middle line:90%
>> RP: Mm-hmm.

00:28:53.799 --> 00:28:54.733 align:middle line:84%
>> RM: So he's on
the edge of it.

00:28:54.733 --> 00:28:55.501 align:middle line:84%
A lot of his friends
are younger,

00:28:55.501 --> 00:28:57.136 align:middle line:90%
a lot are at his own age.

00:28:57.136 --> 00:29:00.673 align:middle line:84%
And one thing I'm seeing is
they're not choosing to buy

00:29:00.673 --> 00:29:05.110 align:middle line:84%
into the structures of family
and marriage in the same way.

00:29:05.110 --> 00:29:07.112 align:middle line:84%
A lot of them are
saying, "Hold on a minute.

00:29:07.112 --> 00:29:09.215 align:middle line:84%
It's really screwed
up out there."

00:29:09.215 --> 00:29:10.316 align:middle line:90%
>> RP: Right.

00:29:10.316 --> 00:29:11.650 align:middle line:84%
>> RM: In fact, I think
of Stuart's friends,

00:29:11.650 --> 00:29:14.720 align:middle line:84%
most of them I've known for
a couple of decades anyway.

00:29:14.720 --> 00:29:17.990 align:middle line:84%
Only a couple of them have even
had children at this point.

00:29:17.990 --> 00:29:19.391 align:middle line:90%
>> RP: Yeah.

00:29:19.391 --> 00:29:21.060 align:middle line:84%
>> RM: Whereas prior to that, it
was happening a little earlier.

00:29:21.060 --> 00:29:24.930 align:middle line:84%
What's going on there in terms
of their perceptions of family,

00:29:24.930 --> 00:29:26.732 align:middle line:90%
relationship, etcetera?

00:29:26.732 --> 00:29:29.602 align:middle line:84%
>> RP: Well, I mean, have you
ever been to a Tumblr page?

00:29:29.602 --> 00:29:30.169 align:middle line:90%
>> RM: A what?

00:29:30.169 --> 00:29:30.870 align:middle line:90%
>> RP: Tumblr.

00:29:30.870 --> 00:29:31.403 align:middle line:90%
>> RM: No.

00:29:31.403 --> 00:29:32.404 align:middle line:90%
>> RP: Okay.

00:29:32.404 --> 00:29:33.439 align:middle line:84%
>> RM: What's Tumblr--
a Tumblr page?

00:29:33.439 --> 00:29:34.440 align:middle line:90%
>> RP: A Tumblr page, yeah.

00:29:34.440 --> 00:29:35.674 align:middle line:90%
>> RM: What's that?

00:29:35.674 --> 00:29:38.644 align:middle line:84%
>> RP: I highly suggest
anybody watching this to...

00:29:38.644 --> 00:29:40.045 align:middle line:84%
>> RM: I guess I'm
really out of [inaudible].

00:29:40.045 --> 00:29:43.382 align:middle line:84%
>> RP: If you want to understand
Pluto and Scorpio, go to Tumblr

00:29:43.382 --> 00:29:45.918 align:middle line:84%
and start going through
Tumblr pages.

00:29:45.918 --> 00:29:46.552 align:middle line:90%
>> RM: Okay.

00:29:46.552 --> 00:29:47.186 align:middle line:90%
>> RP: Because...

00:29:47.186 --> 00:29:48.387 align:middle line:90%
>> RM: What is it?

00:29:48.387 --> 00:29:50.890 align:middle line:84%
>> RP: Tumblr is a -- it's
a form of social media.

00:29:50.890 --> 00:29:52.558 align:middle line:84%
I think they were
just bought recently

00:29:52.558 --> 00:29:54.760 align:middle line:90%
by -- I think its Yahoo.

00:29:54.760 --> 00:29:56.929 align:middle line:90%
I think Yahoo bought Tumblr.

00:29:56.929 --> 00:30:00.132 align:middle line:90%
And Tumblr is --

00:30:00.132 --> 00:30:04.436 align:middle line:84%
it's fascinating because there's
very little text involved.

00:30:04.436 --> 00:30:07.640 align:middle line:84%
And this is a generation
that is breaking away

00:30:07.640 --> 00:30:09.675 align:middle line:84%
from language in
traditional ways.

00:30:09.675 --> 00:30:13.979 align:middle line:84%
We've already talked about
that with texting and code.

00:30:13.979 --> 00:30:18.050 align:middle line:84%
But also, in terms of how
they present themselves.

00:30:18.050 --> 00:30:20.486 align:middle line:84%
You know, they have
cell phone cameras.

00:30:20.486 --> 00:30:22.688 align:middle line:84%
There are these things called
selfies where they take pictures

00:30:22.688 --> 00:30:23.656 align:middle line:90%
of themselves all the time.

00:30:23.656 --> 00:30:25.057 align:middle line:84%
>> RM: Now they have
Google Glass.

00:30:25.057 --> 00:30:25.724 align:middle line:90%
>> RP: Yeah.

00:30:25.724 --> 00:30:26.825 align:middle line:90%
>> RM: That's scary.

00:30:26.825 --> 00:30:30.095 align:middle line:84%
>> RP: So Tumblr is
their own personal page

00:30:30.095 --> 00:30:32.398 align:middle line:90%
and it's mostly images.

00:30:32.398 --> 00:30:34.833 align:middle line:90%
You know, very little text.

00:30:34.833 --> 00:30:36.535 align:middle line:84%
And this is how they
tell their story.

00:30:36.535 --> 00:30:38.537 align:middle line:84%
And if you go into
a Tumblr page,

00:30:38.537 --> 00:30:41.173 align:middle line:84%
you'll be -- you'll
be blown away.

00:30:41.173 --> 00:30:44.243 align:middle line:84%
I -- I did a piece on
Pluto and Scorpio in my --

00:30:44.243 --> 00:30:47.613 align:middle line:84%
on my blog and I found this
hip-hop artist named [inaudible]

00:30:47.613 --> 00:30:51.317 align:middle line:84%
who's from the Bay Area and
I was fascinated by her.

00:30:51.317 --> 00:30:53.218 align:middle line:90%
I was fascinated by her --

00:30:53.218 --> 00:30:56.622 align:middle line:84%
by her songs, so I went to her
Tumblr page and I started to go

00:30:56.622 --> 00:31:00.125 align:middle line:84%
to Tumblr pages that people
were liking, you know,

00:31:00.125 --> 00:31:03.162 align:middle line:84%
or people that were part of
her, you know, her fan base.

00:31:03.162 --> 00:31:05.064 align:middle line:90%
And I was blown away.

00:31:05.064 --> 00:31:07.833 align:middle line:84%
I remember seeing this
one -- this one page.

00:31:07.833 --> 00:31:09.301 align:middle line:84%
So with Tumblr, you'll
have an image.

00:31:09.301 --> 00:31:11.070 align:middle line:84%
You get to see who
the person is.

00:31:11.070 --> 00:31:15.107 align:middle line:84%
And I saw this girl, she might
have been about 17, right?

00:31:15.107 --> 00:31:17.843 align:middle line:84%
And I looked at her and
she had this big smile,

00:31:17.843 --> 00:31:19.478 align:middle line:90%
you know, and nice hair.

00:31:19.478 --> 00:31:21.947 align:middle line:84%
Like oh, she's you know,
an attractive young woman.

00:31:21.947 --> 00:31:23.816 align:middle line:84%
I went through her
Tumblr page and all

00:31:23.816 --> 00:31:25.484 align:middle line:90%
of a sudden was like, woah!

00:31:25.484 --> 00:31:26.185 align:middle line:90%
TMI. You know?

00:31:26.185 --> 00:31:28.854 align:middle line:90%
I mean, what graphics.

00:31:28.854 --> 00:31:29.688 align:middle line:90%
>> RM: [Inaudible].

00:31:29.688 --> 00:31:30.556 align:middle line:90%
>> RP: We're talking graphic.

00:31:30.556 --> 00:31:31.890 align:middle line:90%
Hence Triple X.

00:31:31.890 --> 00:31:32.624 align:middle line:90%
>> RM: Oh my gosh.

00:31:32.624 --> 00:31:33.625 align:middle line:90%
>> RP: Yeah.

00:31:33.625 --> 00:31:34.426 align:middle line:84%
>> RM: And that's
common on Tumblr?

00:31:34.426 --> 00:31:35.794 align:middle line:90%
>> RP: It's very common.

00:31:35.794 --> 00:31:36.862 align:middle line:90%
Absolutely, very common.

00:31:36.862 --> 00:31:38.897 align:middle line:84%
>> RM: So what's
the power game or --

00:31:38.897 --> 00:31:41.433 align:middle line:84%
what's the power
game going on there?

00:31:41.433 --> 00:31:44.470 align:middle line:84%
I mean we know that women have
been conditioned since the '60s

00:31:44.470 --> 00:31:46.972 align:middle line:84%
and '70s, take your
power, take your power.

00:31:46.972 --> 00:31:50.009 align:middle line:84%
The whole porn thing has
certainly exploded since then.

00:31:50.009 --> 00:31:52.544 align:middle line:84%
Then the girls take
the tough role.

00:31:52.544 --> 00:31:53.379 align:middle line:90%
They're going to be dominant.

00:31:53.379 --> 00:31:54.646 align:middle line:90%
Lara Croft, Tomb Raider.

00:31:54.646 --> 00:31:55.681 align:middle line:90%
>> RP: That's right.

00:31:55.681 --> 00:31:56.949 align:middle line:84%
>> RM: You know, we
started getting --

00:31:56.949 --> 00:31:57.850 align:middle line:84%
the women are going to be
the dominant, tough ones.

00:31:57.850 --> 00:31:58.951 align:middle line:90%
>> RP: That's right.

00:31:58.951 --> 00:32:00.052 align:middle line:84%
>> RM: And drag the
boys around behind them.

00:32:00.052 --> 00:32:01.320 align:middle line:90%
What's going on now?

00:32:01.320 --> 00:32:03.822 align:middle line:84%
>> RP: Well, it's -- it's
-- yeah, I don't know,

00:32:03.822 --> 00:32:07.693 align:middle line:84%
because I don't really hang out
with that generation that much

00:32:07.693 --> 00:32:09.028 align:middle line:90%
>> RM: Yeah.

00:32:09.028 --> 00:32:12.131 align:middle line:84%
>> RP: But from what I can
tell and understand, they're --

00:32:12.131 --> 00:32:14.666 align:middle line:90%
they -- they're very into sex.

00:32:14.666 --> 00:32:16.201 align:middle line:90%
Sex is power.

00:32:16.201 --> 00:32:20.406 align:middle line:84%
And -- and you were asking
about, you know, what is the --

00:32:20.406 --> 00:32:22.508 align:middle line:90%
the sort of cultural standards

00:32:22.508 --> 00:32:24.610 align:middle line:84%
around marriage and
things like this.

00:32:24.610 --> 00:32:25.611 align:middle line:90%
>> RM: Right.

00:32:25.611 --> 00:32:26.712 align:middle line:84%
>> RP: This is --
this is a really,

00:32:26.712 --> 00:32:29.481 align:middle line:84%
what I would term a
polysexual generation.

00:32:29.481 --> 00:32:32.584 align:middle line:84%
You know, this is a
generation that has no problem

00:32:32.584 --> 00:32:34.186 align:middle line:90%
with same-sex marriages.

00:32:34.186 --> 00:32:35.020 align:middle line:90%
>> RM: Right.

00:32:35.020 --> 00:32:36.355 align:middle line:90%
>> RP: No problem with same sex.

00:32:36.355 --> 00:32:39.691 align:middle line:84%
I mean, this is a very, very
different group of people.

00:32:39.691 --> 00:32:42.161 align:middle line:84%
>> RM: That's one thing I
noticed in schools in general.

00:32:42.161 --> 00:32:45.364 align:middle line:84%
That there was the phase
maybe five or ten years ago

00:32:45.364 --> 00:32:48.434 align:middle line:84%
that I think has continued, but
it was popular for girls to go

00:32:48.434 --> 00:32:51.036 align:middle line:84%
out with girls for a while
and for everyone to more

00:32:51.036 --> 00:32:52.237 align:middle line:90%
or less just experiment.

00:32:52.237 --> 00:32:54.339 align:middle line:84%
But girls with girls
in particular...

00:32:54.339 --> 00:32:55.007 align:middle line:90%
>> RP: Yeah.

00:32:55.007 --> 00:32:56.208 align:middle line:90%
>> RM: Was the deal.

00:32:56.208 --> 00:32:57.643 align:middle line:84%
And that was supposed to
be a turn-on for the boys.

00:32:57.643 --> 00:33:00.379 align:middle line:84%
The girls may or may
not have been lesbian.

00:33:00.379 --> 00:33:01.580 align:middle line:90%
It was not really relevant.

00:33:01.580 --> 00:33:03.382 align:middle line:84%
It was just something
you were supposed to do.

00:33:03.382 --> 00:33:04.049 align:middle line:90%
>> RP: Right.

00:33:04.049 --> 00:33:05.150 align:middle line:90%
Now let's be clear.

00:33:05.150 --> 00:33:06.452 align:middle line:84%
This is not everybody
in this generation.

00:33:06.452 --> 00:33:07.086 align:middle line:90%
>> RM: No.

00:33:07.086 --> 00:33:07.886 align:middle line:90%
No. I understand.

00:33:07.886 --> 00:33:09.054 align:middle line:90%
>> RP: [Inaudible] you know.

00:33:09.054 --> 00:33:11.590 align:middle line:84%
>> RM: It's just a
trending on top of the norm.

00:33:11.590 --> 00:33:12.091 align:middle line:90%
>> RP: Yeah.

00:33:12.091 --> 00:33:12.624 align:middle line:90%
It is.

00:33:12.624 --> 00:33:13.826 align:middle line:90%
>> RM: Yeah.

00:33:13.826 --> 00:33:15.861 align:middle line:84%
>> RP: In fact, one of my
readers and subscribers

00:33:15.861 --> 00:33:19.865 align:middle line:84%
to my newsletter is a
librarian in New York

00:33:19.865 --> 00:33:24.870 align:middle line:84%
and she's told me stories about
young girls that come to her.

00:33:24.870 --> 00:33:27.372 align:middle line:84%
And they're kind of
horrific actually

00:33:27.372 --> 00:33:33.579 align:middle line:84%
because boys will ask --
ask her if she does anal.

00:33:33.579 --> 00:33:34.279 align:middle line:90%
>> RM: Are you kidding?

00:33:34.279 --> 00:33:35.514 align:middle line:90%
>> RP: No.

00:33:35.514 --> 00:33:38.050 align:middle line:84%
And if she doesn't do anal,
she's not worth dating.

00:33:38.050 --> 00:33:39.318 align:middle line:90%
>> RM: Oh, goodness.

00:33:39.318 --> 00:33:42.154 align:middle line:84%
>> RP: And unfortunately
there's a level of perversion,

00:33:42.154 --> 00:33:43.956 align:middle line:84%
because again we're
talking the generation...

00:33:43.956 --> 00:33:45.290 align:middle line:84%
>> RM: Well, that's a
lower Scorpio trait.

00:33:45.290 --> 00:33:46.125 align:middle line:90%
>> RP: It is.

00:33:46.125 --> 00:33:47.526 align:middle line:90%
It's a horrible Scorpio trend.

00:33:47.526 --> 00:33:51.797 align:middle line:84%
But they're having to deal with
it and its shaping and morphing

00:33:51.797 --> 00:33:53.098 align:middle line:90%
and warping their values.

00:33:53.098 --> 00:33:54.500 align:middle line:84%
>> RM: And it makes sense
because they're very young,

00:33:54.500 --> 00:33:56.235 align:middle line:84%
they're immature,
they're Scorpio,

00:33:56.235 --> 00:33:57.603 align:middle line:84%
they're in the Scorpio
generation [inaudible].

00:33:57.603 --> 00:33:59.805 align:middle line:84%
>> RP: Well, they grew up with
porn on the Internet, too.

00:33:59.805 --> 00:34:01.206 align:middle line:90%
>> RM: Yes.

00:34:01.206 --> 00:34:03.942 align:middle line:84%
>> RP: This is a generation that
had access to porn in a way --

00:34:03.942 --> 00:34:07.246 align:middle line:84%
we had, you know, I don't
know, Playboy Magazine,

00:34:07.246 --> 00:34:10.115 align:middle line:84%
which was nothing
compared to what's online

00:34:10.115 --> 00:34:11.550 align:middle line:90%
at any given point in time.

00:34:11.550 --> 00:34:14.853 align:middle line:84%
And they've had full access
to that from a very young age.

00:34:14.853 --> 00:34:18.390 align:middle line:84%
That's another part of their
generation which sets them apart

00:34:18.390 --> 00:34:19.658 align:middle line:90%
from other generations.

00:34:19.658 --> 00:34:22.060 align:middle line:84%
>> RM: So one-on-one
relationships are really looking

00:34:22.060 --> 00:34:25.030 align:middle line:84%
pale and boring and not
something that's holding a lot

00:34:25.030 --> 00:34:26.430 align:middle line:90%
of intrigue.

00:34:26.430 --> 00:34:30.536 align:middle line:84%
>> RP: I don't necessarily think
that that's what they're about.

00:34:30.536 --> 00:34:33.705 align:middle line:84%
No. Pluto and Libra,
just going back in time,

00:34:33.705 --> 00:34:38.376 align:middle line:84%
one of the most important films
for them was the movie Singles.

00:34:38.376 --> 00:34:41.580 align:middle line:84%
I don't know if you -- it was
all about living in Seattle.

00:34:41.580 --> 00:34:42.147 align:middle line:90%
>> RM: Oh, yeah.

00:34:42.147 --> 00:34:42.714 align:middle line:90%
I did see it.

00:34:42.714 --> 00:34:43.649 align:middle line:90%
>> RP: Right.

00:34:43.649 --> 00:34:45.150 align:middle line:84%
You know? Matt --
what's his name?

00:34:45.150 --> 00:34:45.717 align:middle line:90%
Not Matt Damon.

00:34:45.717 --> 00:34:46.418 align:middle line:90%
The other Matt.

00:34:46.418 --> 00:34:47.151 align:middle line:90%
The Matt that went away.

00:34:47.151 --> 00:34:47.986 align:middle line:90%
>> RM: Yeah, Matt.

00:34:47.986 --> 00:34:49.321 align:middle line:90%
I know who you're talking about.

00:34:49.321 --> 00:34:50.856 align:middle line:90%
Yeah. Dillion?

00:34:50.856 --> 00:34:52.791 align:middle line:90%
>> RP: Matt Dillion, right.

00:34:52.791 --> 00:34:55.593 align:middle line:84%
That was all about,
you know, partnering

00:34:55.593 --> 00:34:56.862 align:middle line:90%
and finding the right person.

00:34:56.862 --> 00:35:00.833 align:middle line:84%
And that's a Pluto and
Libra kind of movie.

00:35:00.833 --> 00:35:02.634 align:middle line:90%
This generation doesn't Singles.

00:35:02.634 --> 00:35:04.636 align:middle line:84%
>> RM: What would -- give us a
couple movies that really kind

00:35:04.636 --> 00:35:06.038 align:middle line:90%
of represent this generation.

00:35:06.038 --> 00:35:08.473 align:middle line:84%
>> RP: Well, I would say that
you would probably have to go

00:35:08.473 --> 00:35:10.442 align:middle line:90%
into the Twilight series.

00:35:10.442 --> 00:35:11.577 align:middle line:90%
>> RM: Yeah.

00:35:11.577 --> 00:35:15.480 align:middle line:84%
>> RP: And these are the
films that tweaked them

00:35:15.480 --> 00:35:17.482 align:middle line:90%
and it's all about vampirism.

00:35:17.482 --> 00:35:19.418 align:middle line:84%
It's all about love
in the underworld.

00:35:19.418 --> 00:35:21.520 align:middle line:90%
Very Scorpionic themes.

00:35:21.520 --> 00:35:25.390 align:middle line:84%
Another one would be the
HBO series True Blood,

00:35:25.390 --> 00:35:28.560 align:middle line:84%
which was a series
of books originally.

00:35:28.560 --> 00:35:29.695 align:middle line:90%
>> RM: Yes.

00:35:29.695 --> 00:35:31.897 align:middle line:84%
>> RP: And sort of the
tail end of it for them,

00:35:31.897 --> 00:35:34.032 align:middle line:84%
it sort of may be picking
a little on the Pluto

00:35:34.032 --> 00:35:36.635 align:middle line:84%
and Sagittariusness of
the Harry Potter books

00:35:36.635 --> 00:35:40.339 align:middle line:84%
and the Harry Potter films which
are about Black Magic of course.

00:35:40.339 --> 00:35:41.974 align:middle line:84%
>> RM: And there is
a bit of an obsession

00:35:41.974 --> 00:35:43.208 align:middle line:90%
with death within that.

00:35:43.208 --> 00:35:44.509 align:middle line:90%
>> RP: Absolutely.

00:35:44.509 --> 00:35:45.711 align:middle line:90%
Absolutely.

00:35:45.711 --> 00:35:46.845 align:middle line:84%
There is a bit of an
obsession with -- there is.

00:35:46.845 --> 00:35:47.512 align:middle line:90%
It's death.

00:35:47.512 --> 00:35:48.447 align:middle line:90%
Death, death, death.

00:35:48.447 --> 00:35:49.748 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:35:49.748 --> 00:35:53.051 align:middle line:84%
>> RM: So what -- what does
it take in terms of the --

00:35:53.051 --> 00:35:54.853 align:middle line:90%
I mean it's so hard to say

00:35:54.853 --> 00:35:57.089 align:middle line:84%
because of the outside
influences

00:35:57.089 --> 00:35:59.324 align:middle line:90%
that are really supporting this.

00:35:59.324 --> 00:36:02.194 align:middle line:84%
What would it take for
that -- that breakthrough,

00:36:02.194 --> 00:36:04.630 align:middle line:90%
that rebirth to start occurring?

00:36:04.630 --> 00:36:06.098 align:middle line:90%
>> RP: They have to hit a wall.

00:36:06.098 --> 00:36:09.534 align:middle line:84%
I mean, Scorpio is -- it's
kind of like having the moment

00:36:09.534 --> 00:36:11.870 align:middle line:84%
of clarity, you know,
in Alcoholics Anonymous.

00:36:11.870 --> 00:36:13.005 align:middle line:90%
You hit the wall.

00:36:13.005 --> 00:36:16.174 align:middle line:84%
You finally push against
something hard enough

00:36:16.174 --> 00:36:17.309 align:middle line:90%
and it pushes back.

00:36:17.309 --> 00:36:18.810 align:middle line:84%
>> RM: You're looking at
astrology all the time.

00:36:18.810 --> 00:36:21.480 align:middle line:84%
What is that thing that
could be just hard enough

00:36:21.480 --> 00:36:23.382 align:middle line:84%
that can influence
this generation

00:36:23.382 --> 00:36:26.018 align:middle line:84%
to start moving toward
their eagle?

00:36:26.018 --> 00:36:30.822 align:middle line:84%
>> RP: Well, I think
potentially, it would have to do

00:36:30.822 --> 00:36:32.791 align:middle line:90%
with their sexual energy.

00:36:32.791 --> 00:36:33.625 align:middle line:90%
>> RM: Mm-hmm.

00:36:33.625 --> 00:36:34.593 align:middle line:90%
>> RP: And their sexual power,

00:36:34.593 --> 00:36:35.827 align:middle line:84%
to take it up a couple
of octaves.

00:36:35.827 --> 00:36:36.862 align:middle line:90%
>> RM: Like they just burn

00:36:36.862 --> 00:36:38.096 align:middle line:84%
out after they've
explored everything?

00:36:38.096 --> 00:36:38.930 align:middle line:90%
>> RP: They could.

00:36:38.930 --> 00:36:40.265 align:middle line:90%
Theoretically, that could be --

00:36:40.265 --> 00:36:43.535 align:middle line:84%
I think that that could be
the most graceful sort of path

00:36:43.535 --> 00:36:46.605 align:middle line:84%
that they could take, to
take it up a few notches.

00:36:46.605 --> 00:36:50.976 align:middle line:84%
The hope -- the --
hopefully this wouldn't occur,

00:36:50.976 --> 00:36:57.082 align:middle line:84%
but the path that would be
much more tragic would be a --

00:36:57.082 --> 00:36:58.250 align:middle line:90%
the disease or disorder

00:36:58.250 --> 00:37:00.319 align:middle line:84%
or something along
the lines of AIDS.

00:37:00.319 --> 00:37:01.320 align:middle line:90%
>> RM: Oh, I see.

00:37:01.320 --> 00:37:02.087 align:middle line:84%
>> RP: That would
spread through...

00:37:02.087 --> 00:37:03.288 align:middle line:90%
>> RM: That forces it.

00:37:03.288 --> 00:37:04.323 align:middle line:84%
>> RP: That would spread
through their generation.

00:37:04.323 --> 00:37:05.557 align:middle line:84%
And with that, they
would really have

00:37:05.557 --> 00:37:07.492 align:middle line:84%
to reconsider what they were
doing with their energy.

00:37:07.492 --> 00:37:09.027 align:middle line:84%
>> RM: Well, now when we're
talking about their energy,

00:37:09.027 --> 00:37:11.897 align:middle line:84%
let's look at, you know, a
whole other aspect of life

00:37:11.897 --> 00:37:14.099 align:middle line:84%
which is the workforce
in general.

00:37:14.099 --> 00:37:17.035 align:middle line:84%
I had a conversation -- I
won't name him right now,

00:37:17.035 --> 00:37:18.270 align:middle line:90%
with a British person who was --

00:37:18.270 --> 00:37:21.139 align:middle line:84%
had been high up
in JP Morgan quit.

00:37:21.139 --> 00:37:22.274 align:middle line:90%
>> RP: Yeah.

00:37:22.274 --> 00:37:23.675 align:middle line:84%
>> RM: He was going in
a whole other direction,

00:37:23.675 --> 00:37:27.312 align:middle line:84%
and basically he's looking for
spiritual resonance in finance.

00:37:27.312 --> 00:37:28.714 align:middle line:90%
>> RP: Mm-hmm.

00:37:28.714 --> 00:37:31.750 align:middle line:84%
>> RM: And he was saying that
this generation, basically 30

00:37:31.750 --> 00:37:35.220 align:middle line:84%
and under, very large
corporations are now having

00:37:35.220 --> 00:37:37.422 align:middle line:90%
to meet and meet with coaches

00:37:37.422 --> 00:37:40.792 align:middle line:84%
like himself to say,
"It's dying.

00:37:40.792 --> 00:37:42.027 align:middle line:90%
Our mall's dying.

00:37:42.027 --> 00:37:43.261 align:middle line:90%
We can't sell to these guys.

00:37:43.261 --> 00:37:44.596 align:middle line:84%
We've got a whole
generation coming

00:37:44.596 --> 00:37:46.631 align:middle line:84%
up we don't even
know how to sell to."

00:37:46.631 --> 00:37:47.466 align:middle line:90%
>> RP: Right.

00:37:47.466 --> 00:37:48.400 align:middle line:90%
>> RM: And so, it's like that

00:37:48.400 --> 00:37:50.802 align:middle line:84%
"sell to" isn't really
an option.

00:37:50.802 --> 00:37:53.972 align:middle line:84%
Something else has to be
born to keep the machine

00:37:53.972 --> 00:37:56.241 align:middle line:90%
of the economy rolling.

00:37:56.241 --> 00:37:57.242 align:middle line:90%
>> RP: Yeah.

00:37:57.242 --> 00:37:58.510 align:middle line:84%
>> RM: What's that
look like to you?

00:37:58.510 --> 00:38:00.245 align:middle line:84%
>> RP: Well, you also
have to understand

00:38:00.245 --> 00:38:03.482 align:middle line:84%
that these kids are sitting
on a mountain of student debt.

00:38:03.482 --> 00:38:04.049 align:middle line:90%
>> RM: Yes.

00:38:04.049 --> 00:38:04.716 align:middle line:90%
It's horrible.

00:38:04.716 --> 00:38:06.084 align:middle line:90%
>> RP: From college.

00:38:06.084 --> 00:38:09.187 align:middle line:84%
And they -- so they have all
this debt that they've accrued

00:38:09.187 --> 00:38:13.025 align:middle line:84%
and they come out into the
workforce and they realize

00:38:13.025 --> 00:38:17.562 align:middle line:84%
that the jobs that they need
in order to attack their debt

00:38:17.562 --> 00:38:20.132 align:middle line:84%
and have a life,
they're just not there.

00:38:20.132 --> 00:38:21.500 align:middle line:90%
>> RM: They're not there.

00:38:21.500 --> 00:38:23.535 align:middle line:84%
>> RP: The jobs aren't there
and they're having to take jobs

00:38:23.535 --> 00:38:25.737 align:middle line:90%
that are outside of their --

00:38:25.737 --> 00:38:29.374 align:middle line:84%
what they've studied or they're
having to work for a lot less.

00:38:29.374 --> 00:38:31.109 align:middle line:84%
And this will lead to
some disillusionment.

00:38:31.109 --> 00:38:32.911 align:middle line:90%
But this is a tough generation.

00:38:32.911 --> 00:38:34.780 align:middle line:90%
These are strong kids.

00:38:34.780 --> 00:38:37.649 align:middle line:84%
And if they decide that they
want to be entrepreneurial

00:38:37.649 --> 00:38:40.886 align:middle line:84%
or have ideas that are --
that are individual based

00:38:40.886 --> 00:38:43.488 align:middle line:84%
or they want to work
together, they will follow

00:38:43.488 --> 00:38:45.023 align:middle line:90%
through on their ideas.

00:38:45.023 --> 00:38:46.858 align:middle line:90%
Scorpio is a fixed sign.

00:38:46.858 --> 00:38:49.728 align:middle line:84%
So I think in terms of their
generation and how they're going

00:38:49.728 --> 00:38:53.165 align:middle line:84%
to be dealing with their
purpose, or being able

00:38:53.165 --> 00:38:54.599 align:middle line:84%
to make a living
or have a vocation

00:38:54.599 --> 00:38:56.835 align:middle line:84%
or whatever those
things are, there's going

00:38:56.835 --> 00:38:59.704 align:middle line:84%
to be a very individual
experience for them.

00:38:59.704 --> 00:39:00.939 align:middle line:84%
>> RM: They're going to
create their own thing.

00:39:00.939 --> 00:39:02.607 align:middle line:84%
>> RP: They're going to
create their own thing.

00:39:02.607 --> 00:39:03.942 align:middle line:90%
>> RM: [Inaudible].

00:39:03.942 --> 00:39:06.344 align:middle line:84%
One of the things I noticed
just in moving about trying

00:39:06.344 --> 00:39:07.646 align:middle line:84%
to have some fun,
a little travel,

00:39:07.646 --> 00:39:09.281 align:middle line:84%
because these guys
are saddled with debt.

00:39:09.281 --> 00:39:10.382 align:middle line:90%
>> RP: Yeah.

00:39:10.382 --> 00:39:11.316 align:middle line:84%
>> RM: And crummy jobs
that don't pay much.

00:39:11.316 --> 00:39:13.018 align:middle line:84%
They have degrees
-- good degrees.

00:39:13.018 --> 00:39:14.219 align:middle line:90%
>> RP: Yeah.

00:39:14.219 --> 00:39:15.420 align:middle line:84%
>> RM: And that means
you can be a sales clerk.

00:39:15.420 --> 00:39:17.322 align:middle line:84%
Maybe you can be a barista
or something like that.

00:39:17.322 --> 00:39:18.323 align:middle line:90%
>> RP: Yeah.

00:39:18.323 --> 00:39:19.925 align:middle line:84%
>> RM: With that
degree, is that they --

00:39:19.925 --> 00:39:22.060 align:middle line:84%
they created the whole
couch surfing thing.

00:39:22.060 --> 00:39:24.196 align:middle line:84%
Again, there seems
to be this kind

00:39:24.196 --> 00:39:26.765 align:middle line:84%
of underground travel
thing, trusting each other,

00:39:26.765 --> 00:39:30.135 align:middle line:84%
surfing on a stranger's couch,
which has graduated to Air B&B,

00:39:30.135 --> 00:39:32.604 align:middle line:84%
which is surfing on
someone's couch for 20 bucks.

00:39:32.604 --> 00:39:33.572 align:middle line:90%
>> RP: Yeah.

00:39:33.572 --> 00:39:34.940 align:middle line:84%
>> RM: Or $30 or
something like that.

00:39:34.940 --> 00:39:37.676 align:middle line:84%
It's kind of interesting because
that's becoming a big deal.

00:39:37.676 --> 00:39:39.945 align:middle line:84%
>> RP: This is actually a really
good point that you bring up.

00:39:39.945 --> 00:39:41.880 align:middle line:90%
There's a company right now

00:39:41.880 --> 00:39:44.950 align:middle line:84%
in San Francisco started
by two 19-year-olds.

00:39:44.950 --> 00:39:47.953 align:middle line:84%
And this is -- this is --
again, they had an idea.

00:39:47.953 --> 00:39:49.488 align:middle line:90%
This is their idea.

00:39:49.488 --> 00:39:51.890 align:middle line:84%
They said, "We're going to
do something very different.

00:39:51.890 --> 00:39:56.361 align:middle line:84%
We're not -- we're going to have
a parking lot by the airport.

00:39:56.361 --> 00:39:59.764 align:middle line:84%
And we're going to have
people bring their cars

00:39:59.764 --> 00:40:01.066 align:middle line:84%
to the parking lot,
and guess what?

00:40:01.066 --> 00:40:03.034 align:middle line:84%
We're going to rent
their cars out."

00:40:03.034 --> 00:40:04.703 align:middle line:84%
>> RM: While they're in --
while they're on a flight?

00:40:04.703 --> 00:40:05.403 align:middle line:90%
>> RP: Yeah.

00:40:05.403 --> 00:40:05.937 align:middle line:90%
>> RM: Going somewhere?

00:40:05.937 --> 00:40:07.105 align:middle line:90%
>> RP: Yeah.

00:40:07.105 --> 00:40:10.375 align:middle line:84%
So that, now I'm not
paying for parking, right?

00:40:10.375 --> 00:40:11.510 align:middle line:90%
>> RM: You're getting paid.

00:40:11.510 --> 00:40:13.512 align:middle line:84%
>> RP: You're getting
paid while you're away.

00:40:13.512 --> 00:40:16.047 align:middle line:84%
You get an oil change, and
you get your car washed.

00:40:16.047 --> 00:40:17.415 align:middle line:90%
And these kids are doing this.

00:40:17.415 --> 00:40:18.483 align:middle line:90%
They're 19 years old.

00:40:18.483 --> 00:40:19.651 align:middle line:84%
>> RM: How do they
get the insurance?

00:40:19.651 --> 00:40:21.052 align:middle line:90%
I mean, that's the funny thing.

00:40:21.052 --> 00:40:22.821 align:middle line:84%
>> RP: Well, they got funding
because they had a good idea.

00:40:22.821 --> 00:40:23.321 align:middle line:90%
>> RM: Wow.

00:40:23.321 --> 00:40:24.256 align:middle line:90%
Right.

00:40:24.256 --> 00:40:25.590 align:middle line:84%
>> RP: And so they
went after this.

00:40:25.590 --> 00:40:29.394 align:middle line:84%
Now, San Francisco County
and the City of San Francisco

00:40:29.394 --> 00:40:31.630 align:middle line:84%
who actually runs
the airport, "Well,

00:40:31.630 --> 00:40:33.198 align:middle line:84%
you need insurance
and you've got to..."

00:40:33.198 --> 00:40:33.965 align:middle line:90%
>> RM: I know, I mean, that's...

00:40:33.965 --> 00:40:35.300 align:middle line:90%
yeah.

00:40:35.300 --> 00:40:36.234 align:middle line:84%
>> RP: "But you've got to
have these-- these, you know,

00:40:36.234 --> 00:40:37.369 align:middle line:84%
you've got to sign
off on this form

00:40:37.369 --> 00:40:39.004 align:middle line:84%
and you've got to
be approved here."

00:40:39.004 --> 00:40:40.338 align:middle line:90%
>> RM: That's what I meant.

00:40:40.338 --> 00:40:41.540 align:middle line:90%
How can they do it [inaudible].

00:40:41.540 --> 00:40:42.741 align:middle line:84%
>> RP: [Inaudible] they're
like, "We don't care."

00:40:42.741 --> 00:40:43.375 align:middle line:90%
>> RM: Exactly.

00:40:43.375 --> 00:40:44.409 align:middle line:90%
>> RP: That's old.

00:40:44.409 --> 00:40:45.443 align:middle line:90%
That's an old model.

00:40:45.443 --> 00:40:46.945 align:middle line:90%
We don't care.

00:40:46.945 --> 00:40:48.013 align:middle line:90%
We don't worry.

00:40:48.013 --> 00:40:49.214 align:middle line:84%
And this kid said,
"Well, what about going

00:40:49.214 --> 00:40:50.215 align:middle line:90%
to court and being sued?"

00:40:50.215 --> 00:40:51.516 align:middle line:84%
He said, "We don't
worry about that."

00:40:51.516 --> 00:40:52.150 align:middle line:90%
>> RM: Exactly.

00:40:52.150 --> 00:40:53.151 align:middle line:90%
They don't.

00:40:53.151 --> 00:40:54.119 align:middle line:84%
>> RP: They don't
worry about that.

00:40:54.119 --> 00:40:56.021 align:middle line:84%
That's part of their
strength, right?

00:40:56.021 --> 00:40:59.057 align:middle line:84%
And they're thinking
outside the box.

00:40:59.057 --> 00:41:03.395 align:middle line:84%
There's another company called
Lyft, L-Y-F-T, and Lyft was --

00:41:03.395 --> 00:41:05.897 align:middle line:84%
and it's still doing
pretty well.

00:41:05.897 --> 00:41:09.501 align:middle line:84%
Lyft is a company where if you
have a car, right, and you want

00:41:09.501 --> 00:41:11.636 align:middle line:84%
to pick somebody
up, all somebody has

00:41:11.636 --> 00:41:14.472 align:middle line:84%
to do is have the Lyft
app and they can --

00:41:14.472 --> 00:41:17.342 align:middle line:84%
and you have the Lyft app,
they can go onto the Lyft app.

00:41:17.342 --> 00:41:18.944 align:middle line:90%
They'll see that you're online.

00:41:18.944 --> 00:41:20.645 align:middle line:84%
They'll hit you with
something, right?

00:41:20.645 --> 00:41:23.114 align:middle line:84%
And you go pick them up
and they'll, you know,

00:41:23.114 --> 00:41:24.482 align:middle line:90%
they'll pay you 20 bucks.

00:41:24.482 --> 00:41:28.553 align:middle line:84%
Well, of course the taxicab
drivers were furious, right?

00:41:28.553 --> 00:41:29.688 align:middle line:90%
You can't [inaudible]...

00:41:29.688 --> 00:41:30.956 align:middle line:84%
>> RM: I think they're
using a similar app now.

00:41:30.956 --> 00:41:32.257 align:middle line:84%
>> RP: The cabs --
the taxicabs, yes.

00:41:32.257 --> 00:41:33.425 align:middle line:90%
They are. They are.

00:41:33.425 --> 00:41:34.526 align:middle line:90%
>> RM: Yes.

00:41:34.526 --> 00:41:35.560 align:middle line:84%
>> RP: They finally woke
up the 21st Century.

00:41:35.560 --> 00:41:36.628 align:middle line:90%
>> RM: Yes.

00:41:36.628 --> 00:41:37.696 align:middle line:84%
>> RP: Well, it was
really interesting.

00:41:37.696 --> 00:41:39.531 align:middle line:84%
Again, this is a San
Francisco experience

00:41:39.531 --> 00:41:41.566 align:middle line:84%
because Silicon Valley's
right by there.

00:41:41.566 --> 00:41:44.402 align:middle line:84%
The City of San Francisco
went after Lyfed

00:41:44.402 --> 00:41:45.870 align:middle line:84%
and they said, "You
can't do this.

00:41:45.870 --> 00:41:48.106 align:middle line:84%
You've got to have
your drivers insured --

00:41:48.106 --> 00:41:49.474 align:middle line:90%
dah dah dah dah dah dah."

00:41:49.474 --> 00:41:53.545 align:middle line:84%
Lyft provided enough of
a pushback where the City

00:41:53.545 --> 00:41:57.082 align:middle line:84%
of San Francisco backed off a
little bit and they said, "Well,

00:41:57.082 --> 00:41:59.651 align:middle line:84%
all we need is some background
checks on your drivers.

00:41:59.651 --> 00:42:00.885 align:middle line:90%
Basically at the end of the day,

00:42:00.885 --> 00:42:03.188 align:middle line:84%
the background check was
more important to the City

00:42:03.188 --> 00:42:06.758 align:middle line:84%
of San Francisco, but Lyft
was able to stay in business.

00:42:06.758 --> 00:42:11.329 align:middle line:84%
So this is a generation that
is changing how we do things.

00:42:11.329 --> 00:42:13.465 align:middle line:84%
You know, it's changing
the rules.

00:42:13.465 --> 00:42:14.733 align:middle line:84%
They're saying, "We're
just going to go about it.

00:42:14.733 --> 00:42:16.301 align:middle line:84%
We're going to do
things differently."

00:42:16.301 --> 00:42:17.802 align:middle line:90%
And I applaud that, completely.

00:42:17.802 --> 00:42:19.137 align:middle line:90%
>> RM: Oh, I do, too.

00:42:19.137 --> 00:42:21.306 align:middle line:84%
I mean -- I -- I really --
I'm hearing what you're saying

00:42:21.306 --> 00:42:24.476 align:middle line:84%
about Generation XXX, and I
know that it's gotten kind

00:42:24.476 --> 00:42:26.144 align:middle line:84%
of tweaked out, and
I feel really --

00:42:26.144 --> 00:42:28.279 align:middle line:84%
honestly, I feel sorry
for a lot of the girls.

00:42:28.279 --> 00:42:29.614 align:middle line:90%
>> RP: Yeah.

00:42:29.614 --> 00:42:30.615 align:middle line:84%
>> RM: Because they didn't
get a chance to just be girls.

00:42:30.615 --> 00:42:31.316 align:middle line:90%
>> RP: It's true.

00:42:31.316 --> 00:42:32.684 align:middle line:90%
>> RM: That generation.

00:42:32.684 --> 00:42:34.352 align:middle line:84%
I mean, again -- I mean, if
you're choosing to [inaudible]

00:42:34.352 --> 00:42:37.889 align:middle line:84%
under Pluto and Scorpio,
in these times,

00:42:37.889 --> 00:42:40.258 align:middle line:84%
then you know what you're
getting to as a soul

00:42:40.258 --> 00:42:42.794 align:middle line:84%
and maybe it's not
necessary to go through that.

00:42:42.794 --> 00:42:45.930 align:middle line:84%
Maybe we'd have to go through
this incredibly intense

00:42:45.930 --> 00:42:48.333 align:middle line:84%
and somewhat tweaked
period of time in order

00:42:48.333 --> 00:42:50.635 align:middle line:84%
to emerge something
stronger on the other side.

00:42:50.635 --> 00:42:51.836 align:middle line:90%
>> RP: I agree.

00:42:51.836 --> 00:42:53.872 align:middle line:84%
I agree. It's -- we're in
a very Scorpionic time.

00:42:53.872 --> 00:42:54.439 align:middle line:90%
>> RM: Yes.

00:42:54.439 --> 00:42:55.140 align:middle line:90%
>> RP: You know.

00:42:55.140 --> 00:42:56.841 align:middle line:90%
Very transformational.

00:42:56.841 --> 00:42:57.776 align:middle line:90%
>> RM: Yeah.

00:42:57.776 --> 00:42:58.877 align:middle line:84%
>> RP: And these
kids are warriors.

00:42:58.877 --> 00:42:59.844 align:middle line:90%
>> RM: Yeah.

00:42:59.844 --> 00:43:00.979 align:middle line:84%
>> RP: That's really
what they are.

00:43:00.979 --> 00:43:02.047 align:middle line:84%
>> RM: I'm really glad
to hear you say that,

00:43:02.047 --> 00:43:02.947 align:middle line:84%
because we're feeling
sorry for them.

00:43:02.947 --> 00:43:04.049 align:middle line:90%
They can't find decent work.

00:43:04.049 --> 00:43:05.950 align:middle line:84%
Well, who wants most
of those jobs anyway?

00:43:05.950 --> 00:43:07.185 align:middle line:90%
>> RP: Right.

00:43:07.185 --> 00:43:07.719 align:middle line:84%
>> RM: I mean, most of
these people are not wanting

00:43:07.719 --> 00:43:08.820 align:middle line:90%
to plug in.

00:43:08.820 --> 00:43:10.121 align:middle line:84%
You do have a large
aspect of the population

00:43:10.121 --> 00:43:12.190 align:middle line:84%
that does want jobs
as engineers,

00:43:12.190 --> 00:43:13.591 align:middle line:84%
and in tech fields,
and so forth.

00:43:13.591 --> 00:43:17.228 align:middle line:84%
But what happens to all of those
artistic souls on the planet

00:43:17.228 --> 00:43:20.565 align:middle line:84%
that have gotten stuffed into
jobs as insurance salesmen

00:43:20.565 --> 00:43:22.967 align:middle line:84%
or whatnot, when really
that wasn't their calling

00:43:22.967 --> 00:43:24.302 align:middle line:90%
in previous generations.

00:43:24.302 --> 00:43:25.103 align:middle line:90%
>> RP: Yeah.

00:43:25.103 --> 00:43:26.237 align:middle line:90%
>> RM: These guy have to --

00:43:26.237 --> 00:43:27.806 align:middle line:84%
artists have to create
something, don't they?

00:43:27.806 --> 00:43:29.174 align:middle line:84%
>> RP: They do have
to create something.

00:43:29.174 --> 00:43:34.846 align:middle line:84%
And it's unfortunate because
art is being excluded in a lot

00:43:34.846 --> 00:43:38.883 align:middle line:84%
of ways from the curriculum,
and the whole idea of the arts

00:43:38.883 --> 00:43:41.219 align:middle line:84%
to be able to, you
know, keep us in touch

00:43:41.219 --> 00:43:45.490 align:middle line:84%
with our humanity is being
eroded at the college level.

00:43:45.490 --> 00:43:48.226 align:middle line:84%
Not necessarily at
the elementary level.

00:43:48.226 --> 00:43:49.160 align:middle line:90%
>> RM: High school, it's gone.

00:43:49.160 --> 00:43:49.828 align:middle line:90%
>> RP: Yeah.

00:43:49.828 --> 00:43:51.029 align:middle line:90%
>> RM: Pretty much.

00:43:51.029 --> 00:43:52.397 align:middle line:84%
>> RP: And at the college
level, what's really --

00:43:52.397 --> 00:43:56.000 align:middle line:84%
what's driving people now in
college, especially more so now

00:43:56.000 --> 00:43:59.037 align:middle line:84%
than ever, is the ability
to obviously make money.

00:43:59.037 --> 00:44:01.272 align:middle line:84%
And the ability to
make money are things

00:44:01.272 --> 00:44:04.542 align:middle line:90%
like the neurosciences and a lot

00:44:04.542 --> 00:44:07.245 align:middle line:84%
of these extremely
high tech field,

00:44:07.245 --> 00:44:09.781 align:middle line:84%
which is where all the
research dollars are.

00:44:09.781 --> 00:44:14.385 align:middle line:84%
And that's a really
tricky place in terms of,

00:44:14.385 --> 00:44:15.620 align:middle line:90%
you know, [inaudible].

00:44:15.620 --> 00:44:16.921 align:middle line:84%
>> RM: Let's talk about
it, because we're also kind

00:44:16.921 --> 00:44:18.923 align:middle line:84%
of segwaying into the
notion of transhumanism.

00:44:18.923 --> 00:44:19.758 align:middle line:90%
>> RP: That's right.

00:44:19.758 --> 00:44:20.725 align:middle line:90%
>> RM: We're talking about --

00:44:20.725 --> 00:44:21.826 align:middle line:84%
we're talking about
transhumanism

00:44:21.826 --> 00:44:23.928 align:middle line:84%
in like half the movies
out there right now.

00:44:23.928 --> 00:44:25.029 align:middle line:90%
>> RP: Yeah.

00:44:25.029 --> 00:44:27.699 align:middle line:84%
Transhumanism is a --
it's the next wave.

00:44:27.699 --> 00:44:32.137 align:middle line:84%
It's a really -- it's -- you
know, again, if you want to look

00:44:32.137 --> 00:44:35.473 align:middle line:84%
at the Pluto and Scorpio
kids, one of the big films

00:44:35.473 --> 00:44:37.909 align:middle line:84%
for them were the
Terminator series.

00:44:37.909 --> 00:44:38.977 align:middle line:90%
>> RM: Yeah.

00:44:38.977 --> 00:44:40.078 align:middle line:84%
>> RP: They were raised
on the Terminator.

00:44:40.078 --> 00:44:41.646 align:middle line:84%
There was Terminator
One and Terminator Two.

00:44:41.646 --> 00:44:44.716 align:middle line:84%
Robots play a big role
in their consciousness.

00:44:44.716 --> 00:44:48.553 align:middle line:84%
So this whole concept or notion
of transhumanism is something

00:44:48.553 --> 00:44:52.557 align:middle line:84%
that they could probably
sign off on on some level

00:44:52.557 --> 00:44:54.025 align:middle line:84%
because they were --
they were raised with it.

00:44:54.025 --> 00:44:56.127 align:middle line:84%
But transhumanism
really is the --

00:44:56.127 --> 00:45:01.132 align:middle line:84%
it's the end of the human in
many ways, shapes, and forms.

00:45:01.132 --> 00:45:04.936 align:middle line:84%
I mean, and if we look at
the big picture, you know,

00:45:04.936 --> 00:45:08.273 align:middle line:84%
we've reached this point where,
especially here in this country,

00:45:08.273 --> 00:45:13.745 align:middle line:84%
in the United States, the masses
of people in order to, you know,

00:45:13.745 --> 00:45:16.848 align:middle line:84%
man a factory and fuel
the assembly lines,

00:45:16.848 --> 00:45:18.583 align:middle line:90%
they're not needed anymore.

00:45:18.583 --> 00:45:19.717 align:middle line:90%
You know, we are --

00:45:19.717 --> 00:45:22.020 align:middle line:84%
we are useless eaters
at this point in time.

00:45:22.020 --> 00:45:22.787 align:middle line:90%
>> RM: Yes.

00:45:22.787 --> 00:45:23.321 align:middle line:90%
That's what we're called.

00:45:23.321 --> 00:45:23.855 align:middle line:90%
>> RP: Yeah.

00:45:23.855 --> 00:45:25.190 align:middle line:90%
Absolutely.

00:45:25.190 --> 00:45:26.658 align:middle line:84%
And transhumanism comes along
and gets to replace us --

00:45:26.658 --> 00:45:29.928 align:middle line:84%
and to replace -- it's replacing
us at an alarming rate,

00:45:29.928 --> 00:45:31.129 align:middle line:90%
to be honest with you.

00:45:31.129 --> 00:45:32.197 align:middle line:84%
>> RM: How would
you explain that?

00:45:32.197 --> 00:45:33.898 align:middle line:90%
>> RP: Well, I mean, if you go

00:45:33.898 --> 00:45:40.772 align:middle line:84%
into a sophisticated warehouse
now, the actual human workforce

00:45:40.772 --> 00:45:43.808 align:middle line:84%
in a very sophisticated
warehouse has been reduced

00:45:43.808 --> 00:45:45.476 align:middle line:90%
by about two thirds.

00:45:45.476 --> 00:45:47.212 align:middle line:90%
It's completely automated.

00:45:47.212 --> 00:45:50.648 align:middle line:84%
They have these small
robots that move boxes

00:45:50.648 --> 00:45:51.983 align:middle line:90%
from one place to another.

00:45:51.983 --> 00:45:57.288 align:middle line:84%
They're all -- they're all
kind of guided by RFID signals.

00:45:57.288 --> 00:46:00.725 align:middle line:84%
So they have somebody at
a workstation who punches

00:46:00.725 --> 00:46:04.629 align:middle line:84%
in the RFID signal and you've
got to go from this zone

00:46:04.629 --> 00:46:07.131 align:middle line:84%
to this zone and move
this to this place.

00:46:07.131 --> 00:46:10.635 align:middle line:84%
And they've got all these robots
moving these large packages

00:46:10.635 --> 00:46:13.171 align:middle line:84%
around in ways that
humans used to.

00:46:13.171 --> 00:46:14.372 align:middle line:90%
My father was a warehouseman.

00:46:14.372 --> 00:46:15.340 align:middle line:90%
>> RM: Right.

00:46:15.340 --> 00:46:16.040 align:middle line:84%
>> RP: My father
belonged to a union.

00:46:16.040 --> 00:46:17.141 align:middle line:90%
>> RM: Right.

00:46:17.141 --> 00:46:17.976 align:middle line:84%
>> RP: That's how we
-- that's how we lived.

00:46:17.976 --> 00:46:19.043 align:middle line:90%
My father would be obsolete now.

00:46:19.043 --> 00:46:20.979 align:middle line:84%
And that's just --
that's just one example

00:46:20.979 --> 00:46:21.846 align:middle line:90%
of what I'm talking about.

00:46:21.846 --> 00:46:23.214 align:middle line:90%
>> RM: Right.

00:46:23.214 --> 00:46:25.483 align:middle line:84%
>> RP: There's a -- was a big
piece this week that popped

00:46:25.483 --> 00:46:29.254 align:middle line:84%
up on the Internet where robots
are now making their presence

00:46:29.254 --> 00:46:30.855 align:middle line:90%
felt in farming.

00:46:30.855 --> 00:46:33.157 align:middle line:84%
And they're replacing
farm workers.

00:46:33.157 --> 00:46:36.094 align:middle line:84%
You know, this whole idea that,
you know, we need immigrants

00:46:36.094 --> 00:46:38.162 align:middle line:84%
to work the farms,
that's going --

00:46:38.162 --> 00:46:41.199 align:middle line:84%
that's going to be a quaint
notion within 10 years

00:46:41.199 --> 00:46:42.767 align:middle line:90%
because even they will be phased

00:46:42.767 --> 00:46:47.805 align:middle line:84%
out by high end technological
means

00:46:47.805 --> 00:46:52.744 align:middle line:84%
of not only tending the crops
but also getting the crops

00:46:52.744 --> 00:46:55.079 align:middle line:90%
in from the field and sorting.

00:46:55.079 --> 00:46:58.516 align:middle line:84%
We're in a -- this is the brave
new world in the workforce.

00:46:58.516 --> 00:47:01.152 align:middle line:84%
There was -- there was something
else that I was -- nurses.

00:47:01.152 --> 00:47:04.856 align:middle line:84%
Nurses are being displaced
by robots in hospitals.

00:47:04.856 --> 00:47:05.390 align:middle line:90%
>> RM: Really?

00:47:05.390 --> 00:47:06.591 align:middle line:90%
>> RP: Yeah.

00:47:06.591 --> 00:47:08.760 align:middle line:84%
They have robots that can
actually move medicines

00:47:08.760 --> 00:47:09.961 align:middle line:84%
and trays and things
[inaudible]...

00:47:09.961 --> 00:47:11.262 align:middle line:90%
>> RM: That's a horrible trend.

00:47:11.262 --> 00:47:12.463 align:middle line:90%
>> RP: Up -- up in...

00:47:12.463 --> 00:47:14.699 align:middle line:84%
Yeah. And ultimately, you
know, we're losing touch

00:47:14.699 --> 00:47:18.336 align:middle line:84%
with the ability to have
human contact in hospitals.

00:47:18.336 --> 00:47:20.572 align:middle line:84%
Now people say, "Well, you
know, you're -- you're paranoid.

00:47:20.572 --> 00:47:22.206 align:middle line:84%
You know, you're
10-15 [inaudible]."

00:47:22.206 --> 00:47:23.908 align:middle line:90%
No, it's here right now.

00:47:23.908 --> 00:47:25.109 align:middle line:90%
We're staring down.

00:47:25.109 --> 00:47:29.147 align:middle line:84%
Time Magazine is putting
out a very sophisticated,

00:47:29.147 --> 00:47:33.418 align:middle line:84%
glossy book in September
called "Rise of the Robots."

00:47:33.418 --> 00:47:35.186 align:middle line:90%
They're conditioning us.

00:47:35.186 --> 00:47:37.021 align:middle line:84%
>> RM: Well, certainly
Hollywood's been conditioning us

00:47:37.021 --> 00:47:38.356 align:middle line:90%
for a decade to expect this.

00:47:38.356 --> 00:47:39.724 align:middle line:90%
>> RP: Absolutely.

00:47:39.724 --> 00:47:43.227 align:middle line:84%
And the robots have been
made to look and be friendly,

00:47:43.227 --> 00:47:44.495 align:middle line:90%
and to be our friends.

00:47:44.495 --> 00:47:48.232 align:middle line:84%
And at some point, those
robots will not be our friends.

00:47:48.232 --> 00:47:51.069 align:middle line:84%
Like for instance,
when we look at drones.

00:47:51.069 --> 00:47:53.237 align:middle line:90%
You know, drones are --

00:47:53.237 --> 00:47:56.140 align:middle line:84%
drones are an outgrowth
of transhumanism,

00:47:56.140 --> 00:48:01.713 align:middle line:84%
even though they don't have the
human and synthetic interface.

00:48:01.713 --> 00:48:04.315 align:middle line:84%
They do on some level,
because on one end

00:48:04.315 --> 00:48:06.651 align:middle line:84%
of the drone experience
is a human, right?

00:48:06.651 --> 00:48:07.452 align:middle line:90%
>> RM: Right.

00:48:07.452 --> 00:48:08.419 align:middle line:90%
>> RP: That's going to end,

00:48:08.419 --> 00:48:10.488 align:middle line:84%
because humans have
a conscience.

00:48:10.488 --> 00:48:11.589 align:middle line:90%
>> RM: Right.

00:48:11.589 --> 00:48:12.790 align:middle line:84%
>> RP: No matter --
no matter how diff --

00:48:12.790 --> 00:48:18.229 align:middle line:84%
no matter how hard these
consciences are tweaked

00:48:18.229 --> 00:48:21.532 align:middle line:90%
and abused, we still have them.

00:48:21.532 --> 00:48:25.403 align:middle line:84%
And there was a young -- a young
man who just came out and said,

00:48:25.403 --> 00:48:27.071 align:middle line:84%
"I was a drone operator
and I feel

00:48:27.071 --> 00:48:29.307 align:middle line:84%
like the worst psychopath
on the planet."

00:48:29.307 --> 00:48:31.342 align:middle line:84%
He hates himself
for what he did.

00:48:31.342 --> 00:48:34.479 align:middle line:84%
Well, that's a human error, and
that guy's going to be replaced.

00:48:34.479 --> 00:48:35.713 align:middle line:90%
And so guess who's going

00:48:35.713 --> 00:48:37.382 align:middle line:84%
to be running those
[inaudible] and those missions?

00:48:37.382 --> 00:48:38.216 align:middle line:90%
>> RM: That generation.

00:48:38.216 --> 00:48:38.716 align:middle line:90%
>> RP: No.

00:48:38.716 --> 00:48:39.283 align:middle line:90%
it will...

00:48:39.283 --> 00:48:39.984 align:middle line:90%
>> RM: No one.

00:48:39.984 --> 00:48:40.718 align:middle line:90%
There will be no people.

00:48:40.718 --> 00:48:41.285 align:middle line:90%
That's right.

00:48:41.285 --> 00:48:42.320 align:middle line:90%
>> RP: No one.

00:48:42.320 --> 00:48:43.254 align:middle line:84%
No one. They will
have the coordinates

00:48:43.254 --> 00:48:44.856 align:middle line:84%
and they will do
what they're told.

00:48:44.856 --> 00:48:46.824 align:middle line:84%
And this -- we're in
Uranus in Aries right now.

00:48:46.824 --> 00:48:48.126 align:middle line:84%
We can talk about
Uranus and Aries

00:48:48.126 --> 00:48:50.161 align:middle line:84%
and how this relates
to transhumanism.

00:48:50.161 --> 00:48:55.500 align:middle line:84%
And drones -- let's say
you're a robot soldier, right?

00:48:55.500 --> 00:48:56.968 align:middle line:84%
You can repair yourself
in the field.

00:48:56.968 --> 00:48:57.735 align:middle line:90%
>> RM: Right.

00:48:57.735 --> 00:48:58.770 align:middle line:90%
>> RP: You can do things.

00:48:58.770 --> 00:49:00.171 align:middle line:90%
You don't need a medic.

00:49:00.171 --> 00:49:03.341 align:middle line:84%
You can do things to yourself
in order to continue to fight

00:49:03.341 --> 00:49:04.609 align:middle line:90%
or do whatever you need.

00:49:04.609 --> 00:49:07.045 align:middle line:84%
And the other thing that
they're working with in terms

00:49:07.045 --> 00:49:10.214 align:middle line:84%
of artificial intelligence
is facial recognition.

00:49:10.214 --> 00:49:14.419 align:middle line:84%
And if facial recognition
is hard-wired into,

00:49:14.419 --> 00:49:18.222 align:middle line:84%
say a robot soldier
or a robot cop,

00:49:18.222 --> 00:49:21.459 align:middle line:84%
they can basically make a
value-based judgment based

00:49:21.459 --> 00:49:25.663 align:middle line:84%
on everything that's
been downloaded into them

00:49:25.663 --> 00:49:27.632 align:middle line:90%
on your facial criteria.

00:49:27.632 --> 00:49:30.868 align:middle line:84%
They can take your pulse rate,
your breathing, you know,

00:49:30.868 --> 00:49:33.938 align:middle line:84%
your eye twitch and they can
make a value-based judgment

00:49:33.938 --> 00:49:35.039 align:middle line:90%
on all of that.

00:49:35.039 --> 00:49:36.974 align:middle line:84%
And that's where --
that's where this --

00:49:36.974 --> 00:49:38.342 align:middle line:90%
this is headed [inaudible].

00:49:38.342 --> 00:49:40.611 align:middle line:84%
>> RM: So that is essentially
completely eliminating human

00:49:40.611 --> 00:49:42.413 align:middle line:90%
contact, the human touch.

00:49:42.413 --> 00:49:44.315 align:middle line:84%
I mean, just in the
medical industry alone.

00:49:44.315 --> 00:49:45.583 align:middle line:90%
>> RP: Yeah.

00:49:45.583 --> 00:49:47.318 align:middle line:84%
>> RM: The thought of a
person being in an environment

00:49:47.318 --> 00:49:50.254 align:middle line:84%
like a hospital with no
human contact or touch

00:49:50.254 --> 00:49:52.657 align:middle line:84%
or very little is
more terrifying

00:49:52.657 --> 00:49:54.459 align:middle line:84%
than the staff that's already
running [inaudible], [laughter].

00:49:54.459 --> 00:49:56.961 align:middle line:84%
>> RP: Well, humans have been
conditioned for that, right?

00:49:56.961 --> 00:49:58.362 align:middle line:90%
>> RM: Yes.

00:49:58.362 --> 00:49:59.864 align:middle line:84%
>> RP: I mean, if you look at
the -- the evolution of doctors

00:49:59.864 --> 00:50:02.366 align:middle line:84%
and medicine, you know, 40 years
ago, you had a family doctor.

00:50:02.366 --> 00:50:03.634 align:middle line:90%
>> RM: Yeah.

00:50:03.634 --> 00:50:05.269 align:middle line:84%
>> RP: And that doctor
stayed with you and knew you.

00:50:05.269 --> 00:50:06.237 align:middle line:90%
>> RM: Yes.

00:50:06.237 --> 00:50:07.605 align:middle line:84%
>> RP: And you trusted
that doctor.

00:50:07.605 --> 00:50:10.708 align:middle line:84%
Well, that -- that's in the,
you know, dustbin of history.

00:50:10.708 --> 00:50:12.543 align:middle line:84%
And then we moved into
HMOs, you don't know

00:50:12.543 --> 00:50:14.412 align:middle line:90%
who you're going to see, right?

00:50:14.412 --> 00:50:15.680 align:middle line:84%
You don't -- they have
no history with you.

00:50:15.680 --> 00:50:16.748 align:middle line:84%
>> RM: So there's no
personal relationship.

00:50:16.748 --> 00:50:17.982 align:middle line:84%
>> RP: There's no
personal relationships.

00:50:17.982 --> 00:50:20.451 align:middle line:84%
And we've actually been
conditioned to begin

00:50:20.451 --> 00:50:22.086 align:middle line:90%
to accept these things.

00:50:22.086 --> 00:50:23.421 align:middle line:90%
>> RM: But there's something --

00:50:23.421 --> 00:50:27.692 align:middle line:84%
again going back into this
generation, that when you said,

00:50:27.692 --> 00:50:30.094 align:middle line:84%
as we were talking about
earlier, if it gets to the point

00:50:30.094 --> 00:50:33.698 align:middle line:84%
where everything has been
explored and exploited enough,

00:50:33.698 --> 00:50:36.367 align:middle line:84%
especially sexually where
there's no connection,

00:50:36.367 --> 00:50:39.604 align:middle line:84%
just hardcore sex, isn't
there a possibility that seed

00:50:39.604 --> 00:50:42.206 align:middle line:84%
of yearning -- Scorpio
also yearns for intimacy

00:50:42.206 --> 00:50:43.608 align:middle line:90%
and deep, deep contact.

00:50:43.608 --> 00:50:44.175 align:middle line:90%
>> RP: Yes.

00:50:44.175 --> 00:50:44.742 align:middle line:90%
Lots of depth.

00:50:44.742 --> 00:50:45.710 align:middle line:90%
Very much so.

00:50:45.710 --> 00:50:46.878 align:middle line:84%
>> RM: And you don't
get depth out of

00:50:46.878 --> 00:50:48.846 align:middle line:90%
that kind of relationship.

00:50:48.846 --> 00:50:49.847 align:middle line:90%
>> RP: No.

00:50:49.847 --> 00:50:50.615 align:middle line:84%
They need to burn
through it though.

00:50:50.615 --> 00:50:51.282 align:middle line:90%
I mean, that's part of it.

00:50:51.282 --> 00:50:52.550 align:middle line:90%
>> RM: Yes.

00:50:52.550 --> 00:50:53.351 align:middle line:84%
>> RP: That's part of
burning away the [inaudible].

00:50:53.351 --> 00:50:54.352 align:middle line:90%
And that's what Pluto does.

00:50:54.352 --> 00:50:55.820 align:middle line:84%
And they've got double
Pluto, right?

00:50:55.820 --> 00:50:57.889 align:middle line:90%
Pluto and Scorpio together.

00:50:57.889 --> 00:51:00.958 align:middle line:84%
So they can burn
through their experience,

00:51:00.958 --> 00:51:03.361 align:middle line:84%
and they could ultimately
say no.

00:51:03.361 --> 00:51:04.061 align:middle line:90%
>> RM: Yes.

00:51:04.061 --> 00:51:04.795 align:middle line:90%
So that's the potential.

00:51:04.795 --> 00:51:05.863 align:middle line:90%
>> RP: Yes.

00:51:05.863 --> 00:51:07.298 align:middle line:84%
>> RM: And the hope
in this generation.

00:51:07.298 --> 00:51:08.432 align:middle line:90%
>> RP: Yes.

00:51:08.432 --> 00:51:11.068 align:middle line:84%
>> RM: So they've taken
a declining condition

00:51:11.068 --> 00:51:14.038 align:middle line:84%
and they can, like the
Phoenix -- like the Phoenix,

00:51:14.038 --> 00:51:14.605 align:middle line:90%
rise above it, from it.

00:51:14.605 --> 00:51:15.139 align:middle line:90%
>> RP: Right.

00:51:15.139 --> 00:51:16.174 align:middle line:90%
Absolutely.

00:51:16.174 --> 00:51:17.275 align:middle line:84%
I mean, you just go
back to those kids

00:51:17.275 --> 00:51:18.476 align:middle line:84%
that started the
parking lot business.

00:51:18.476 --> 00:51:19.177 align:middle line:90%
>> RM: Yeah, I love that.

00:51:19.177 --> 00:51:19.810 align:middle line:90%
>> RP: In San Francisco.

00:51:19.810 --> 00:51:20.811 align:middle line:90%
They said no.

00:51:20.811 --> 00:51:21.512 align:middle line:90%
>> RM: Yeah.

00:51:21.512 --> 00:51:22.213 align:middle line:90%
>> RP : They said no.

00:51:22.213 --> 00:51:23.548 align:middle line:90%
This is an old story.

00:51:23.548 --> 00:51:25.383 align:middle line:84%
And they said yes
to something else.

00:51:25.383 --> 00:51:27.218 align:middle line:84%
>> RM: Well, this is going
to destroy an old story.

00:51:27.218 --> 00:51:29.153 align:middle line:84%
What happens to the
IRS and the tax roles

00:51:29.153 --> 00:51:31.556 align:middle line:84%
when these are kids are saying,
you know, "The heck with it.

00:51:31.556 --> 00:51:32.523 align:middle line:90%
I don't want to do this."

00:51:32.523 --> 00:51:33.891 align:middle line:84%
>> RP: That's a very
good question.

00:51:33.891 --> 00:51:35.126 align:middle line:90%
It's a really god question.

00:51:35.126 --> 00:51:36.928 align:middle line:84%
>> RM: And I mean, if it
falls, the sooner the better

00:51:36.928 --> 00:51:37.895 align:middle line:90%
as far as I'm concerned.

00:51:37.895 --> 00:51:39.564 align:middle line:84%
>> RP: Saturn in
Scorpio, again IRS.

00:51:39.564 --> 00:51:41.599 align:middle line:84%
We talked about that in
the previous segment.

00:51:41.599 --> 00:51:44.969 align:middle line:84%
They're going to have their own
kind of reckoning at some point.

00:51:44.969 --> 00:51:45.603 align:middle line:90%
>> RM: Yes.

00:51:45.603 --> 00:51:46.137 align:middle line:90%
I would think so.

00:51:46.137 --> 00:51:47.171 align:middle line:90%
>> RP: Yeah.

00:51:47.171 --> 00:51:48.739 align:middle line:84%
>> RM: Let's talk
about the next one.

00:51:48.739 --> 00:51:49.874 align:middle line:90%
18 and under.

00:51:49.874 --> 00:51:51.809 align:middle line:84%
Now we're talking about
Pluto and Sagittarius.

00:51:51.809 --> 00:51:55.546 align:middle line:84%
And it is really
interesting, many --

00:51:55.546 --> 00:52:00.885 align:middle line:84%
much higher incidence of Autism,
of genius, of psychic abilities

00:52:00.885 --> 00:52:02.954 align:middle line:84%
and genetic changes
in this group.

00:52:02.954 --> 00:52:04.355 align:middle line:90%
How do you see it?

00:52:04.355 --> 00:52:05.489 align:middle line:84%
>> RP: Well, it's
really interesting.

00:52:05.489 --> 00:52:07.892 align:middle line:84%
I heard something about
Autism the other day.

00:52:07.892 --> 00:52:12.697 align:middle line:84%
I forget where I heard it or
read it, but there's a group

00:52:12.697 --> 00:52:17.535 align:middle line:84%
of Autistic kids that are
functionally Autistic.

00:52:17.535 --> 00:52:20.104 align:middle line:84%
And they're being
hired for jobs.

00:52:20.104 --> 00:52:23.507 align:middle line:84%
And what's interesting
about them is that --

00:52:23.507 --> 00:52:27.311 align:middle line:84%
how do I say this with --
in a compassionate way?

00:52:27.311 --> 00:52:30.281 align:middle line:84%
They're much more easy to
manipulate and manage on the job

00:52:30.281 --> 00:52:32.950 align:middle line:84%
because they don't have
complex relationships outside

00:52:32.950 --> 00:52:34.185 align:middle line:90%
of the job.

00:52:34.185 --> 00:52:36.354 align:middle line:84%
It's kind of like the trend
that happened in the --

00:52:36.354 --> 00:52:40.224 align:middle line:84%
like in the '80s when they were
hiring Down's Syndrome kids

00:52:40.224 --> 00:52:41.759 align:middle line:84%
to like bag groceries
and stuff like that.

00:52:41.759 --> 00:52:42.260 align:middle line:90%
>> RM: Right.

00:52:42.260 --> 00:52:42.827 align:middle line:90%
Right.

00:52:42.827 --> 00:52:43.661 align:middle line:90%
>> RP: Right?

00:52:43.661 --> 00:52:44.695 align:middle line:90%
There's another level of that.

00:52:44.695 --> 00:52:46.063 align:middle line:84%
So these Autistic
kids are actually --

00:52:46.063 --> 00:52:50.401 align:middle line:84%
they're actually being hired
because they're not pushing back

00:52:50.401 --> 00:52:52.103 align:middle line:84%
like the Pluto and
Scorpio kids are.

00:52:52.103 --> 00:52:53.271 align:middle line:84%
>> RM: Because they're
not engaged socially

00:52:53.271 --> 00:52:54.538 align:middle line:90%
in the same ways.

00:52:54.538 --> 00:52:55.906 align:middle line:84%
>> RP: They're not engaged
socially in the same way,

00:52:55.906 --> 00:52:59.410 align:middle line:84%
and yet they're functioning
enough in order to work.

00:52:59.410 --> 00:53:01.112 align:middle line:84%
But they're an interesting
generation,

00:53:01.112 --> 00:53:02.413 align:middle line:90%
Pluto and Sagittarius.

00:53:02.413 --> 00:53:06.417 align:middle line:84%
They are -- they're going
to be engaged in the pursuit

00:53:06.417 --> 00:53:09.153 align:middle line:84%
of their own authentic
experience.

00:53:09.153 --> 00:53:10.221 align:middle line:90%
>> RM: Yes.

00:53:10.221 --> 00:53:12.490 align:middle line:84%
>> RP: Scorpio and
Sagittarius and similar

00:53:12.490 --> 00:53:13.324 align:middle line:90%
in some ways [inaudible].

00:53:13.324 --> 00:53:14.625 align:middle line:90%
>> RM: But it's not quite as --

00:53:14.625 --> 00:53:15.626 align:middle line:84%
it doesn't have quite the
dark potential [inaudible].

00:53:15.626 --> 00:53:16.494 align:middle line:84%
>> RP: IT doesn't
have the darkness

00:53:16.494 --> 00:53:18.029 align:middle line:90%
and it doesn't have the edge.

00:53:18.029 --> 00:53:21.766 align:middle line:84%
However, Pluto and
Sagittarius can be really wild.

00:53:21.766 --> 00:53:22.967 align:middle line:90%
>> RM: Yeah.

00:53:22.967 --> 00:53:24.702 align:middle line:84%
>> RP: Like I have son
who's a Pluto and Sag kid,

00:53:24.702 --> 00:53:28.172 align:middle line:84%
and at the age of
five, he was on a --

00:53:28.172 --> 00:53:31.676 align:middle line:84%
one of those little razor
scooters and he was going

00:53:31.676 --> 00:53:35.446 align:middle line:84%
down hills that were
completely insane.

00:53:35.446 --> 00:53:37.114 align:middle line:84%
And I'm like, "I
would never have done

00:53:37.114 --> 00:53:38.349 align:middle line:90%
that when I was a kid."

00:53:38.349 --> 00:53:38.916 align:middle line:90%
>> RM: Right?

00:53:38.916 --> 00:53:39.750 align:middle line:90%
>> RP: You know?

00:53:39.750 --> 00:53:40.551 align:middle line:90%
But they kind of have that...

00:53:40.551 --> 00:53:41.519 align:middle line:90%
>> RM: That risk-taker fire.

00:53:41.519 --> 00:53:42.520 align:middle line:90%
>> RP: They.

00:53:42.520 --> 00:53:44.121 align:middle line:84%
They have that hard-wired
into them.

00:53:44.121 --> 00:53:47.291 align:middle line:84%
A lot of them are going to be
incredible athletes, by the way.

00:53:47.291 --> 00:53:49.493 align:middle line:90%
Both the men and the women.

00:53:49.493 --> 00:53:53.831 align:middle line:84%
And they're -- they also have
again this yearning for truth.

00:53:53.831 --> 00:53:56.167 align:middle line:84%
And some of them
-- Sagittarius is,

00:53:56.167 --> 00:53:58.202 align:middle line:90%
can be a very religious sign.

00:53:58.202 --> 00:54:02.740 align:middle line:84%
And some of them will have
a very knee-jerk reaction

00:54:02.740 --> 00:54:04.575 align:middle line:84%
to the Pluto and
Scorpio generation.

00:54:04.575 --> 00:54:07.244 align:middle line:84%
And they will go in
the opposite direction.

00:54:07.244 --> 00:54:10.281 align:middle line:84%
And they'll be very
interested in religion.

00:54:10.281 --> 00:54:14.585 align:middle line:84%
You know, you'll see -- I think
you'll see a kind of a rebirth

00:54:14.585 --> 00:54:17.355 align:middle line:90%
in religion in their generation,

00:54:17.355 --> 00:54:21.892 align:middle line:84%
but it may not necessarily
be really touchy,

00:54:21.892 --> 00:54:23.294 align:middle line:90%
feely, lovey religion.

00:54:23.294 --> 00:54:26.831 align:middle line:84%
It could be very -- Sagittarius
can be a very judgmental sign.

00:54:26.831 --> 00:54:28.899 align:middle line:84%
>> RM: So it could go
back to fundamentalism?

00:54:28.899 --> 00:54:29.934 align:middle line:90%
>> RP: There could be a strain

00:54:29.934 --> 00:54:32.603 align:middle line:84%
of fundamentalism
in this generation.

00:54:32.603 --> 00:54:36.440 align:middle line:84%
The other thing is that they're
being conditioned in some ways,

00:54:36.440 --> 00:54:39.977 align:middle line:84%
because they're the ones I think
that can really pull the rug

00:54:39.977 --> 00:54:45.049 align:middle line:84%
out from the power structures
in terms of truth and allusion,

00:54:45.049 --> 00:54:47.351 align:middle line:84%
because Sagittarius
will just nail it.

00:54:47.351 --> 00:54:49.587 align:middle line:84%
They'll say, "This is
bullshit," you know?

00:54:49.587 --> 00:54:50.721 align:middle line:90%
>> RM: Mm-hmm.

00:54:50.721 --> 00:54:52.123 align:middle line:84%
>> RP: And that's what
Sagittarius is about.

00:54:52.123 --> 00:54:53.457 align:middle line:90%
And what they're trying to do --

00:54:53.457 --> 00:54:55.159 align:middle line:84%
at least my estimation
is what they're trying

00:54:55.159 --> 00:54:59.563 align:middle line:84%
to do right now is condition
this group of kids to begin

00:54:59.563 --> 00:55:05.903 align:middle line:84%
to take on a slightly
more militaristic vocation

00:55:05.903 --> 00:55:07.004 align:middle line:90%
in their lives.

00:55:07.004 --> 00:55:09.039 align:middle line:84%
Like one of the things
that the Department

00:55:09.039 --> 00:55:13.010 align:middle line:84%
of Homeland Security has started
is like this Youth Corps.

00:55:13.010 --> 00:55:14.078 align:middle line:90%
>> RM: Yeah.

00:55:14.078 --> 00:55:15.446 align:middle line:84%
>> RP: Those are all
Pluto and Sag kids.

00:55:15.446 --> 00:55:16.280 align:middle line:90%
>> RM: Yeah.

00:55:16.280 --> 00:55:18.849 align:middle line:90%
>> RP Starting at 14, 15, 16.

00:55:18.849 --> 00:55:22.787 align:middle line:84%
Then you have, you know, Obama
trying to tap into them in terms

00:55:22.787 --> 00:55:25.389 align:middle line:84%
of like, you know,
kind of an Obama Corps.

00:55:25.389 --> 00:55:29.927 align:middle line:84%
And you know, so they're trying
to grab a hold of their psyche

00:55:29.927 --> 00:55:34.165 align:middle line:84%
and bring them into sort
of a more regimented kind

00:55:34.165 --> 00:55:38.102 align:middle line:90%
of order in some ways.

00:55:38.102 --> 00:55:40.838 align:middle line:84%
You know, their film obviously
is  The Hunger Games .

00:55:40.838 --> 00:55:43.140 align:middle line:90%
And if you look at Sagittarius,

00:55:43.140 --> 00:55:45.976 align:middle line:84%
the symbol Sagittarius
is the centaur --

00:55:45.976 --> 00:55:47.445 align:middle line:90%
the centaur with the bow.

00:55:47.445 --> 00:55:49.346 align:middle line:84%
And what does Katniss
Everdeen have?

00:55:49.346 --> 00:55:50.147 align:middle line:90%
She has a bow.

00:55:50.147 --> 00:55:50.981 align:middle line:90%
>> RM: Yes.

00:55:50.981 --> 00:55:51.982 align:middle line:90%
>> RP: She's our [inaudible].

00:55:51.982 --> 00:55:54.385 align:middle line:84%
This is a complete
Sagittarian movie

00:55:54.385 --> 00:55:55.820 align:middle line:90%
and it's all about competition.

00:55:55.820 --> 00:56:00.658 align:middle line:84%
It takes place outdoors,
outside, nature, right?

00:56:00.658 --> 00:56:03.127 align:middle line:84%
And there's a kind
of a regimentation.

00:56:03.127 --> 00:56:05.629 align:middle line:84%
And now ultimately,
theoretically,

00:56:05.629 --> 00:56:09.600 align:middle line:84%
The Hunger Games  is about
some form of revolution.

00:56:09.600 --> 00:56:10.568 align:middle line:90%
RP: I mean, that's...

00:56:10.568 --> 00:56:11.235 align:middle line:90%
>> RM: Right.

00:56:11.235 --> 00:56:12.336 align:middle line:90%
>> RP: That's the...

00:56:12.336 --> 00:56:14.071 align:middle line:84%
>> RM: And the creating
of unlikely heroes.

00:56:14.071 --> 00:56:15.206 align:middle line:90%
>> RP: Exactly.

00:56:15.206 --> 00:56:19.944 align:middle line:84%
Exactly. In November,
we have Ender's Game,

00:56:19.944 --> 00:56:22.546 align:middle line:84%
which is a movie
that's based on a book

00:56:22.546 --> 00:56:26.050 align:middle line:84%
by Orson Scott Card,
who's a novelist.

00:56:26.050 --> 00:56:30.154 align:middle line:84%
And Ender's Game is again
about a group of young people,

00:56:30.154 --> 00:56:33.123 align:middle line:84%
and a boy by the name of Ender,
who are being conditioned

00:56:33.123 --> 00:56:35.426 align:middle line:90%
and trained to fight aliens.

00:56:35.426 --> 00:56:37.528 align:middle line:84%
Like this is the secret
weapon of the planet,

00:56:37.528 --> 00:56:39.997 align:middle line:84%
that these kids are
going to save the world.

00:56:39.997 --> 00:56:43.767 align:middle line:84%
And so you have the male
version of  The Hunger Games .

00:56:43.767 --> 00:56:47.671 align:middle line:84%
Harrison Ford and Ben Kings that
are going to be in this film.

00:56:47.671 --> 00:56:48.372 align:middle line:90%
>> RM: Interesting.

00:56:48.372 --> 00:56:48.939 align:middle line:90%
>> RP: Yeah.

00:56:48.939 --> 00:56:50.608 align:middle line:90%
So these kids...

00:56:50.608 --> 00:56:52.510 align:middle line:84%
>> RM: They feel under
threat, obviously.

00:56:52.510 --> 00:56:54.745 align:middle line:84%
They feel like they have to
consolidate their forces.

00:56:54.745 --> 00:56:55.579 align:middle line:90%
>> RP: They do.

00:56:55.579 --> 00:56:56.780 align:middle line:90%
>> RM: To be able to survive.

00:56:56.780 --> 00:56:58.182 align:middle line:90%
>> RP: They do.

00:56:58.182 --> 00:57:01.018 align:middle line:84%
But I also think that there's --
each generation, again starting

00:57:01.018 --> 00:57:04.955 align:middle line:84%
with Pluto and Leo,
there is a type of media

00:57:04.955 --> 00:57:07.691 align:middle line:90%
and cinematic coercion.

00:57:07.691 --> 00:57:08.392 align:middle line:90%
>> RM: Yes.

00:57:08.392 --> 00:57:08.959 align:middle line:90%
>> RP: That moves it...

00:57:08.959 --> 00:57:09.793 align:middle line:90%
>> RM: You bet.

00:57:09.793 --> 00:57:10.628 align:middle line:90%
>> RP: In a certain direction.

00:57:10.628 --> 00:57:11.362 align:middle line:90%
>> RM: Predictive programming.

00:57:11.362 --> 00:57:12.296 align:middle line:90%
>> RP: Absolutely.

00:57:12.296 --> 00:57:13.264 align:middle line:90%
Absolutely.

00:57:13.264 --> 00:57:15.099 align:middle line:84%
And I think that
these people who --

00:57:15.099 --> 00:57:18.202 align:middle line:84%
who make movies and
who create the media

00:57:18.202 --> 00:57:21.805 align:middle line:84%
at a high level are very
aware of the esoteric nature

00:57:21.805 --> 00:57:23.774 align:middle line:84%
of their art and the
timing of their art.

00:57:23.774 --> 00:57:24.775 align:middle line:90%
>> RM: Oh, yeah.

00:57:24.775 --> 00:57:25.809 align:middle line:84%
You bet. I absolutely
agree with that.

00:57:25.809 --> 00:57:26.944 align:middle line:90%
It's part of an agenda.

00:57:26.944 --> 00:57:28.812 align:middle line:84%
>> RP: And the Pluto
and Sag kids are funny.

00:57:28.812 --> 00:57:31.115 align:middle line:84%
They have really
good senses of humor.

00:57:31.115 --> 00:57:32.116 align:middle line:90%
And very, very [inaudible].

00:57:32.116 --> 00:57:32.917 align:middle line:90%
>> RM: Super smart.

00:57:32.917 --> 00:57:33.717 align:middle line:90%
>> RP: They're very smart.

00:57:33.717 --> 00:57:35.219 align:middle line:90%
They're very, very playful.

00:57:35.219 --> 00:57:36.921 align:middle line:90%
And they like each other.

00:57:36.921 --> 00:57:38.122 align:middle line:90%
They really like each other.

00:57:38.122 --> 00:57:39.690 align:middle line:84%
I've witnessed them
on playgrounds.

00:57:39.690 --> 00:57:40.791 align:middle line:90%
>> RM: Yes.

00:57:40.791 --> 00:57:42.326 align:middle line:84%
>> RP: And they hang
out and they're buddies.

00:57:42.326 --> 00:57:43.460 align:middle line:90%
>> RM: Yeah.

00:57:43.460 --> 00:57:44.495 align:middle line:84%
>> RP: And they're going
to be very interesting

00:57:44.495 --> 00:57:47.064 align:middle line:84%
because they're --
one of the big games

00:57:47.064 --> 00:57:50.301 align:middle line:84%
in their generation is called
Minecraft, and it's all

00:57:50.301 --> 00:57:53.837 align:middle line:84%
about building, and
it's prevalent.

00:57:53.837 --> 00:57:55.005 align:middle line:90%
And they experience things just

00:57:55.005 --> 00:57:57.741 align:middle line:84%
like every other
generation on mass.

00:57:57.741 --> 00:58:03.180 align:middle line:84%
So my Minecraft is their latest
-- their latest pit stop on...

00:58:03.180 --> 00:58:04.548 align:middle line:90%
>> RM: That's interesting.

00:58:04.548 --> 00:58:05.716 align:middle line:90%
>> RP: Yeah.

00:58:05.716 --> 00:58:07.251 align:middle line:84%
>> RM: Again, this person
I was speaking to --

00:58:07.251 --> 00:58:10.721 align:middle line:84%
about earlier having
to do with observing,

00:58:10.721 --> 00:58:15.059 align:middle line:84%
how is the world economically
going to go through this period

00:58:15.059 --> 00:58:16.560 align:middle line:84%
when you don't have
the same kind

00:58:16.560 --> 00:58:18.929 align:middle line:84%
of consumer base
anymore to keep it going.

00:58:18.929 --> 00:58:22.366 align:middle line:84%
They were talking about they
have children in that same Pluto

00:58:22.366 --> 00:58:24.134 align:middle line:90%
and Sagittarius age as you have.

00:58:24.134 --> 00:58:25.369 align:middle line:90%
>> RP: Right.

00:58:25.369 --> 00:58:26.737 align:middle line:84%
>> RM: And they were saying
they'll call you on it.

00:58:26.737 --> 00:58:28.105 align:middle line:90%
If you try to lie to them.

00:58:28.105 --> 00:58:31.809 align:middle line:84%
If you try to sell them on
something that's not consistent

00:58:31.809 --> 00:58:34.178 align:middle line:84%
with what they feel
is authentically true.

00:58:34.178 --> 00:58:35.012 align:middle line:90%
>> RP: Right.

00:58:35.012 --> 00:58:35.813 align:middle line:90%
>> RM: They just won't buy it.

00:58:35.813 --> 00:58:36.647 align:middle line:90%
>> RP: Oh, it's true.

00:58:36.647 --> 00:58:37.281 align:middle line:90%
>> RM: You can't convince them.

00:58:37.281 --> 00:58:38.349 align:middle line:90%
>> RP: Absolutely.

00:58:38.349 --> 00:58:39.550 align:middle line:90%
Absolutely.

00:58:39.550 --> 00:58:42.586 align:middle line:84%
And in fact, I'll just
share a personal anecdote.

00:58:42.586 --> 00:58:43.921 align:middle line:90%
>> RM: Please do.

00:58:43.921 --> 00:58:46.924 align:middle line:84%
>> RP: My son plays little
league and there was his coach.

00:58:46.924 --> 00:58:48.459 align:middle line:90%
He -- you know, he meant well,

00:58:48.459 --> 00:58:50.828 align:middle line:84%
but he went into coach
mode and he was like.

00:58:50.828 --> 00:58:52.396 align:middle line:84%
"Raw, raw, raw, raw,
raw, raw," you know?

00:58:52.396 --> 00:58:54.565 align:middle line:84%
He's said, you know, going into
it, "You've got to do this.

00:58:54.565 --> 00:58:56.233 align:middle line:90%
You've got to do that."

00:58:56.233 --> 00:58:58.369 align:middle line:90%
And I watched my son.

00:58:58.369 --> 00:58:59.403 align:middle line:90%
He was like this.

00:58:59.403 --> 00:59:00.337 align:middle line:90%
>> RM: [Laughter].

00:59:00.337 --> 00:59:00.904 align:middle line:84%
>> RP: You know,
just [inaudible].

00:59:00.904 --> 00:59:01.572 align:middle line:90%
"I'm shut down.

00:59:01.572 --> 00:59:02.406 align:middle line:90%
I'm not listening."

00:59:02.406 --> 00:59:04.141 align:middle line:90%
Because he knew, in that moment,

00:59:04.141 --> 00:59:06.543 align:middle line:84%
that he was getting
kind of a load of B.S.

00:59:06.543 --> 00:59:07.645 align:middle line:90%
>> RM: Yeah.

00:59:07.645 --> 00:59:09.013 align:middle line:84%
>> RP: And that is part
of their generation.

00:59:09.013 --> 00:59:10.247 align:middle line:90%
>> RM: Which is beautiful.

00:59:10.247 --> 00:59:10.781 align:middle line:90%
>> RP: Yeah.

00:59:10.781 --> 00:59:11.482 align:middle line:90%
Absolutely.

00:59:11.482 --> 00:59:12.683 align:middle line:90%
Absolutely.

00:59:12.683 --> 00:59:13.984 align:middle line:84%
>> RM: Because they're not
going to be manipulated

00:59:13.984 --> 00:59:16.654 align:middle line:84%
and have all their power
taken away in the same way

00:59:16.654 --> 00:59:17.721 align:middle line:90%
on a day-to-day basis.

00:59:17.721 --> 00:59:20.190 align:middle line:84%
Now they are being
manipulated via media,

00:59:20.190 --> 00:59:21.659 align:middle line:90%
education, and so forth.

00:59:21.659 --> 00:59:22.726 align:middle line:90%
>> RP: Right.

00:59:22.726 --> 00:59:24.128 align:middle line:84%
>> RM: But just in
their human interactions

00:59:24.128 --> 00:59:25.429 align:middle line:90%
with each other, they're not.

00:59:25.429 --> 00:59:26.830 align:middle line:90%
>> RP: Yeah.

00:59:26.830 --> 00:59:28.799 align:middle line:84%
>> RM: That makes them a little
stronger for being able to carve

00:59:28.799 --> 00:59:32.269 align:middle line:84%
out their own territory
and maybe carry

00:59:32.269 --> 00:59:34.171 align:middle line:90%
on as the Scorpio generation is.

00:59:34.171 --> 00:59:35.406 align:middle line:90%
>> RP: Yeah.

00:59:35.406 --> 00:59:37.207 align:middle line:84%
I think that they may --
they may have some reactions

00:59:37.207 --> 00:59:38.642 align:middle line:84%
to the Pluto and
Scorpio generation.

00:59:38.642 --> 00:59:39.910 align:middle line:90%
>> RM: Yeah.

00:59:39.910 --> 00:59:41.679 align:middle line:84%
>> RP: They may not necessarily
jive with them so much.

00:59:41.679 --> 00:59:42.880 align:middle line:90%
>> RM: Yeah.

00:59:42.880 --> 00:59:43.681 align:middle line:84%
No I mean in terms of
creating their own thing.

00:59:43.681 --> 00:59:44.815 align:middle line:90%
>> RP: Creating.

00:59:44.815 --> 00:59:46.550 align:middle line:84%
They will -- they will
create their own thing.

00:59:46.550 --> 00:59:50.154 align:middle line:84%
This generation loves nature,
and so, you know, if we--

00:59:50.154 --> 00:59:53.190 align:middle line:84%
hopefully if they're not
corralled by, you know,

00:59:53.190 --> 00:59:56.994 align:middle line:84%
green politician agenda 21 and
turn it into the Green Brigade,

00:59:56.994 --> 00:59:58.529 align:middle line:90%
they will stand up for nature.

00:59:58.529 --> 01:00:01.065 align:middle line:84%
And we can count
on them for that.

01:00:01.065 --> 01:00:02.099 align:middle line:90%
>> RM: Excellent.

01:00:02.099 --> 01:00:03.367 align:middle line:84%
Well I personally
have faith in them.

01:00:03.367 --> 01:00:06.236 align:middle line:84%
Maybe because I'm only
meeting with the ones that tend

01:00:06.236 --> 01:00:09.206 align:middle line:84%
to have a little bit
lighter view of the world.

01:00:09.206 --> 01:00:10.207 align:middle line:90%
>> RP: Yeah.

01:00:10.207 --> 01:00:11.742 align:middle line:84%
>> RM: Maybe by my
son's association.

01:00:11.742 --> 01:00:14.611 align:middle line:84%
I don't know, but I have
faith that their creativity

01:00:14.611 --> 01:00:16.280 align:middle line:84%
and their intelligence
is going to --

01:00:16.280 --> 01:00:18.082 align:middle line:84%
well, this will certainly
take us

01:00:18.082 --> 01:00:20.517 align:middle line:84%
to an interesting
places, but I don't know.

01:00:20.517 --> 01:00:21.585 align:middle line:90%
What do you think?

01:00:21.585 --> 01:00:23.153 align:middle line:84%
>> RP: Well, I think
a lot of it depends

01:00:23.153 --> 01:00:25.489 align:middle line:90%
on the older power structures.

01:00:25.489 --> 01:00:26.623 align:middle line:90%
>> RM: Yeah.

01:00:26.623 --> 01:00:27.458 align:middle line:84%
>> RP: And how desperately
they want to hang

01:00:27.458 --> 01:00:30.661 align:middle line:90%
on to their last dying breaths.

01:00:30.661 --> 01:00:31.495 align:middle line:90%
>> RM: Yes.

01:00:31.495 --> 01:00:32.529 align:middle line:90%
>> RP: And it's not just Pluto.

01:00:32.529 --> 01:00:33.497 align:middle line:84%
>> RM: You're not
being very gracious.

01:00:33.497 --> 01:00:34.732 align:middle line:84%
>> RP: It's not just
Pluto and Leo.

01:00:34.732 --> 01:00:36.500 align:middle line:84%
You've got to go back
into Pluto and Cancer.

01:00:36.500 --> 01:00:39.403 align:middle line:84%
A lot of the Pluto and Cancer
people are still around.

01:00:39.403 --> 01:00:40.838 align:middle line:84%
And we're talking
Henry Kissinger.

01:00:40.838 --> 01:00:41.805 align:middle line:90%
>> RM: Yep.

01:00:41.805 --> 01:00:43.006 align:middle line:84%
>> RP: We're talking
Rockefellers.

01:00:43.006 --> 01:00:44.007 align:middle line:90%
You know, the Queen of England.

01:00:44.007 --> 01:00:45.075 align:middle line:90%
>> RM: Yep.

01:00:45.075 --> 01:00:46.076 align:middle line:84%
>> RP: I mean, these
people are the ones

01:00:46.076 --> 01:00:48.545 align:middle line:84%
that are still having
a stranglehold

01:00:48.545 --> 01:00:50.114 align:middle line:90%
on the resources of the planet.

01:00:50.114 --> 01:00:50.681 align:middle line:90%
>> RM: You bet.

01:00:50.681 --> 01:00:51.348 align:middle line:90%
>> RP: And so...

01:00:51.348 --> 01:00:52.249 align:middle line:90%
>> RM: And on power.

01:00:52.249 --> 01:00:53.484 align:middle line:90%
We look at the Queen.

01:00:53.484 --> 01:00:56.487 align:middle line:84%
I mean, won't even pass it
on at her age, you know?

01:00:56.487 --> 01:00:57.154 align:middle line:90%
>> RP: Yeah.

01:00:57.154 --> 01:00:57.821 align:middle line:90%
>> RM: There you go.

01:00:57.821 --> 01:00:59.223 align:middle line:90%
Again, well listen.

01:00:59.223 --> 01:01:02.025 align:middle line:84%
We're out of time and it's been
so interesting talking with you.

01:01:02.025 --> 01:01:03.827 align:middle line:84%
I really appreciate
your perspectives

01:01:03.827 --> 01:01:05.362 align:middle line:90%
on all these generations.

01:01:05.362 --> 01:01:06.363 align:middle line:90%
So we'll do this again.

01:01:06.363 --> 01:01:07.564 align:middle line:90%
>> RP: My pleasure.

01:01:07.564 --> 01:01:09.933 align:middle line:84%
>> RM: For more of Robert's
insightful analysis,

01:01:09.933 --> 01:01:12.336 align:middle line:84%
you can go to his website
at RobertPhoenix.com.

01:01:12.336 --> 01:01:14.738 align:middle line:84%
There are dozens of
thought-provoking articles

01:01:14.738 --> 01:01:16.907 align:middle line:84%
and links to hook up
with for your own chart,

01:01:16.907 --> 01:01:18.242 align:middle line:90%
or those of your children.

01:01:18.242 --> 01:01:20.444 align:middle line:84%
Perhaps we need to take a
break from this neurotic spell

01:01:20.444 --> 01:01:23.347 align:middle line:84%
of business just long enough to
take a step back and see what's

01:01:23.347 --> 01:01:25.516 align:middle line:84%
in this bigger picture
for all our sakes.

01:01:25.516 --> 01:01:29.419 align:middle line:84%
Until next time, thank you for
joining us here on  Gaiam TV .
