>>REGINA MEREDITH: One
great beauty of this time

00:00:29.820 --> 00:00:32.159 align:middle line:10%
is that we're seeing the
convergence of science

00:00:32.159 --> 00:00:33.930 align:middle line:10%
and ancient knowledge.

00:00:33.930 --> 00:00:36.000 align:middle line:10%
More so, it's some of
the younger generation

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:37.560 align:middle line:10%
that are putting
pieces together that

00:00:37.560 --> 00:00:39.240 align:middle line:10%
have been missed until now.

00:00:39.240 --> 00:00:42.240 align:middle line:84%
Tiffany Barsotti is showing
how our body is directly

00:00:42.240 --> 00:00:45.270 align:middle line:84%
interfacing with our higher
mind and consciousness.

00:00:45.270 --> 00:00:47.190 align:middle line:84%
It gives an entirely
different understanding

00:00:47.190 --> 00:00:50.550 align:middle line:84%
of what our glands and
nerves are actually doing.

00:00:50.550 --> 00:00:51.420 align:middle line:90%
Welcome.

00:00:51.420 --> 00:00:53.820 align:middle line:84%
First of all, so people can
get to know you a little bit,

00:00:53.820 --> 00:00:55.500 align:middle line:90%
just tell us your background.

00:00:55.500 --> 00:00:57.208 align:middle line:10%
>>TIFFANY BARSOTTI:
So I actually started

00:00:57.208 --> 00:00:59.310 align:middle line:10%
in the entertainment
industry at about age 16

00:00:59.310 --> 00:01:03.390 align:middle line:10%
and was sort of directionless
living in Los Angeles, South

00:01:03.390 --> 00:01:04.360 align:middle line:10%
Central actually.

00:01:04.360 --> 00:01:06.985 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: What an unusual story
direction, directionless in LA.

00:01:06.985 --> 00:01:08.650 align:middle line:90%
>>BARSOTTI: Directionless in LA.

00:01:08.650 --> 00:01:10.110 align:middle line:90%
Can you imagine?

00:01:10.110 --> 00:01:12.577 align:middle line:84%
And Ruth Pointer of
the Pointer Sisters,

00:01:12.577 --> 00:01:14.160 align:middle line:84%
actually, was like
a surrogate mother.

00:01:14.160 --> 00:01:16.350 align:middle line:10%
And she pointed me in
the direction and said,

00:01:16.350 --> 00:01:18.450 align:middle line:10%
you would make an
excellent manager.

00:01:18.450 --> 00:01:20.610 align:middle line:84%
And so it really gave
me some life direction

00:01:20.610 --> 00:01:22.260 align:middle line:90%
that was beautiful.

00:01:22.260 --> 00:01:24.030 align:middle line:84%
All the while, I
had been dealing

00:01:24.030 --> 00:01:25.830 align:middle line:84%
with my own sort of
health challenges

00:01:25.830 --> 00:01:30.000 align:middle line:84%
and very interested in
Rosicrucian, Egyptian

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:33.750 align:middle line:84%
philosophy, physics
and quantum physics.

00:01:33.750 --> 00:01:36.960 align:middle line:10%
One of my favorite
authors was Fritjof Capra.

00:01:36.960 --> 00:01:39.180 align:middle line:84%
And so "The Tao of
Physics" is what

00:01:39.180 --> 00:01:42.030 align:middle line:84%
I was reading over and
over again at the time.

00:01:42.030 --> 00:01:44.220 align:middle line:84%
The guidance that I
got in that moment

00:01:44.220 --> 00:01:46.110 align:middle line:90%
was call a medical intuitive.

00:01:46.110 --> 00:01:47.220 align:middle line:90%
So I did.

00:01:47.220 --> 00:01:51.270 align:middle line:84%
And within a couple of
days, I was in her office,

00:01:51.270 --> 00:01:53.250 align:middle line:90%
maybe about a week max.

00:01:53.250 --> 00:01:55.740 align:middle line:84%
And she comes out of
her trance-like state.

00:01:55.740 --> 00:01:59.730 align:middle line:84%
And she says, you have three
days to make up your mind.

00:01:59.730 --> 00:02:00.530 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: About?

00:02:00.530 --> 00:02:01.330 align:middle line:90%
>>BARSOTTI: Yeah.

00:02:01.330 --> 00:02:02.990 align:middle line:84%
I wanted to pretend
like I didn't know

00:02:02.990 --> 00:02:04.460 align:middle line:90%
what she was talking about.

00:02:04.460 --> 00:02:08.419 align:middle line:84%
But deep down, I knew,
because I had been told,

00:02:08.419 --> 00:02:12.320 align:middle line:84%
I think at age 18 for 19 by a
good friend, family friend who

00:02:12.320 --> 00:02:14.540 align:middle line:84%
was an astrologer,
you're a healer.

00:02:14.540 --> 00:02:16.850 align:middle line:84%
You're supposed to be
doing these kinds of things

00:02:16.850 --> 00:02:19.250 align:middle line:90%
and be in this realm.

00:02:19.250 --> 00:02:20.600 align:middle line:90%
And I was like, absolutely not.

00:02:20.600 --> 00:02:21.680 align:middle line:90%
I'm a business person.

00:02:21.680 --> 00:02:22.820 align:middle line:90%
I'm ambitious.

00:02:22.820 --> 00:02:23.900 align:middle line:90%
This is what I'm doing.

00:02:23.900 --> 00:02:24.800 align:middle line:90%
And she says, OK.

00:02:24.800 --> 00:02:27.930 align:middle line:84%
It also says you're
a late bloomer.

00:02:27.930 --> 00:02:30.360 align:middle line:84%
So take the road
you need to take.

00:02:30.360 --> 00:02:31.250 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:02:31.250 --> 00:02:34.820 align:middle line:84%
So now, I'm asking you in
advance, because a lot of this

00:02:34.820 --> 00:02:38.570 align:middle line:84%
is science-based, to put it
in lay terms for all of us.

00:02:38.570 --> 00:02:40.340 align:middle line:84%
And we'll have
some lovely imagery

00:02:40.340 --> 00:02:42.260 align:middle line:84%
that will help develop
this, because we're

00:02:42.260 --> 00:02:45.620 align:middle line:84%
talking about systems, glandular
systems, and connections

00:02:45.620 --> 00:02:47.450 align:middle line:84%
in the body, the
autonomic nervous system,

00:02:47.450 --> 00:02:50.868 align:middle line:84%
albeit a brand new take on the
autonomic nervous system, which

00:02:50.868 --> 00:02:52.160 align:middle line:90%
is a part that I find exciting.

00:02:52.160 --> 00:02:53.840 align:middle line:84%
As we're going
through this matrix,

00:02:53.840 --> 00:02:55.670 align:middle line:90%
let's go to the vagus nerve.

00:02:55.670 --> 00:02:58.110 align:middle line:84%
>>BARSOTTI: I'd like to describe
it as an adaptive nerve.

00:02:58.110 --> 00:03:01.610 align:middle line:84%
It's the one that's constantly
reading your outer environment

00:03:01.610 --> 00:03:03.290 align:middle line:90%
to your inner environment.

00:03:03.290 --> 00:03:06.680 align:middle line:84%
And it is the only nerve
in the body that wanders.

00:03:06.680 --> 00:03:08.540 align:middle line:10%
It's also known as the
10th cranial nerve,

00:03:08.540 --> 00:03:11.990 align:middle line:10%
once again branching out of
that same area, which is why

00:03:11.990 --> 00:03:14.330 align:middle line:10%
my attention was drawn to it.

00:03:14.330 --> 00:03:17.255 align:middle line:84%
And it weaves all the
way through the body.

00:03:17.255 --> 00:03:19.130 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: All the way
down through digestive.

00:03:19.130 --> 00:03:21.410 align:middle line:84%
>>BARSOTTI: Digestive,
liver, all the viscera.

00:03:21.410 --> 00:03:23.480 align:middle line:84%
And it also-- so
that's the efferent,

00:03:23.480 --> 00:03:26.250 align:middle line:84%
meaning the downward flow,
the exit out of the brain.

00:03:26.250 --> 00:03:29.630 align:middle line:84%
The afferent is the upward,
going into the brain.

00:03:29.630 --> 00:03:32.040 align:middle line:90%
About 20% are up.

00:03:32.040 --> 00:03:33.740 align:middle line:90%
80% are down.

00:03:33.740 --> 00:03:36.260 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: You're saying
that a lot of people that

00:03:36.260 --> 00:03:39.590 align:middle line:84%
are being diagnosed with
one condition or another,

00:03:39.590 --> 00:03:42.810 align:middle line:84%
it's actually stemming
from the vagus nerve.

00:03:42.810 --> 00:03:43.610 align:middle line:90%
>>BARSOTTI: Yes.

00:03:43.610 --> 00:03:48.980 align:middle line:84%
So if we look at this
as the body's feedback

00:03:48.980 --> 00:03:52.130 align:middle line:84%
in the inflammatory states,
if you've eaten something

00:03:52.130 --> 00:03:55.340 align:middle line:84%
that is gone awry,
and your body is

00:03:55.340 --> 00:03:57.500 align:middle line:84%
trying to give you
some feedback on it.

00:03:57.500 --> 00:03:59.600 align:middle line:84%
And say you just take
some indigestion pills,

00:03:59.600 --> 00:04:04.457 align:middle line:84%
or you just take Beano,
or whatever it is,

00:04:04.457 --> 00:04:07.040 align:middle line:84%
know that's your body actually
trying to communicate something

00:04:07.040 --> 00:04:08.810 align:middle line:90%
that isn't digesting well.

00:04:08.810 --> 00:04:11.270 align:middle line:84%
And that's the vagus that's
actually doing that work.

00:04:11.270 --> 00:04:12.500 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: It's giving
you the information.

00:04:12.500 --> 00:04:14.333 align:middle line:84%
>>BARSOTTI: It's giving
you the information.

00:04:14.333 --> 00:04:16.680 align:middle line:10%
We could look at this
now as three branches.

00:04:16.680 --> 00:04:19.200 align:middle line:10%
We've always looked at the
autonomic nervous system

00:04:19.200 --> 00:04:20.600 align:middle line:10%
is having two.

00:04:20.600 --> 00:04:22.308 align:middle line:84%
But I see that work
in the body as three.

00:04:22.308 --> 00:04:24.517 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Sympathetic and
parasympathetic, and that's

00:04:24.517 --> 00:04:26.450 align:middle line:84%
really all you hear about
is on, off, on, off.

00:04:26.450 --> 00:04:27.492 align:middle line:90%
>>BARSOTTI: Yes, exactly.

00:04:27.492 --> 00:04:28.970 align:middle line:84%
And so now, there's
this other one

00:04:28.970 --> 00:04:32.150 align:middle line:90%
that we call safety or social.

00:04:32.150 --> 00:04:35.060 align:middle line:84%
And that's really
looking at more of--

00:04:35.060 --> 00:04:38.150 align:middle line:84%
there's a theory going on
about the polyvagal theory.

00:04:38.150 --> 00:04:40.250 align:middle line:90%
And this is bringing that in.

00:04:40.250 --> 00:04:43.460 align:middle line:84%
Stephen Porges is the
creator of this theory.

00:04:43.460 --> 00:04:46.910 align:middle line:84%
And he talks about
the difference

00:04:46.910 --> 00:04:51.710 align:middle line:84%
in the nervous system type,
the cell types, and the ones

00:04:51.710 --> 00:04:54.890 align:middle line:84%
that are sort of a protected
nerve, that goes upward

00:04:54.890 --> 00:04:57.920 align:middle line:84%
from the diaphragm, and one
that is less protected that's

00:04:57.920 --> 00:05:04.250 align:middle line:84%
leftover from our reptilian,
our older system, that are

00:05:04.250 --> 00:05:05.780 align:middle line:90%
everything below the diaphragm.

00:05:05.780 --> 00:05:06.620 align:middle line:90%
So this is--

00:05:06.620 --> 00:05:08.120 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Isn't it
interesting, now?

00:05:08.120 --> 00:05:12.680 align:middle line:84%
This brings up a big area of
discussion, because, I mean,

00:05:12.680 --> 00:05:16.940 align:middle line:84%
it's almost an epidemic now that
people are finding themselves

00:05:16.940 --> 00:05:20.660 align:middle line:84%
supposedly allergic to all
of these foods to the point

00:05:20.660 --> 00:05:24.800 align:middle line:84%
where some people find food too
so toxic they can barely eat.

00:05:24.800 --> 00:05:25.850 align:middle line:90%
What's going on?

00:05:25.850 --> 00:05:28.010 align:middle line:84%
>>BARSOTTI: We are
needing to evolve

00:05:28.010 --> 00:05:29.870 align:middle line:90%
the way that we are digesting.

00:05:29.870 --> 00:05:32.420 align:middle line:84%
And I would like to look at this
more from an energetic point

00:05:32.420 --> 00:05:33.220 align:middle line:90%
of view.

00:05:33.220 --> 00:05:35.410 align:middle line:90%
It's what are we not digesting.

00:05:35.410 --> 00:05:38.280 align:middle line:84%
We're all taking in
so much information.

00:05:38.280 --> 00:05:40.670 align:middle line:84%
So if we're on
information overload,

00:05:40.670 --> 00:05:44.360 align:middle line:84%
and we're not digesting either
things from our emotional past,

00:05:44.360 --> 00:05:47.000 align:middle line:84%
things that are unfinished
business that were left over

00:05:47.000 --> 00:05:50.990 align:middle line:84%
from long ago, that were
just left lying dormant,

00:05:50.990 --> 00:05:53.360 align:middle line:84%
and we're not actually
dealing with them,

00:05:53.360 --> 00:05:54.950 align:middle line:84%
these things are
going to show up

00:05:54.950 --> 00:05:56.990 align:middle line:90%
in our inflammatory reflexes.

00:05:56.990 --> 00:05:58.490 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: First of
all, how was this

00:05:58.490 --> 00:06:00.860 align:middle line:84%
discovered, this notion
of a third branch

00:06:00.860 --> 00:06:02.910 align:middle line:90%
of the autonomic nervous system?

00:06:02.910 --> 00:06:07.330 align:middle line:84%
And what does this
actually mean to us

00:06:07.330 --> 00:06:10.960 align:middle line:84%
on a personal level about being
so disconnected and isolated

00:06:10.960 --> 00:06:14.500 align:middle line:84%
as individuals, versus
being socially coherent

00:06:14.500 --> 00:06:16.990 align:middle line:84%
and having that
interpret somehow

00:06:16.990 --> 00:06:18.130 align:middle line:90%
into our nervous system?

00:06:18.130 --> 00:06:20.100 align:middle line:84%
>>BARSOTTI: Yeah, a
couple of things here.

00:06:20.100 --> 00:06:23.140 align:middle line:84%
So it's discovery has
been somewhat recent.

00:06:23.140 --> 00:06:26.560 align:middle line:84%
However, if you look back
to AT Still's work, who

00:06:26.560 --> 00:06:30.220 align:middle line:84%
wrote on osteopathic medicine
and manual manipulation,

00:06:30.220 --> 00:06:32.620 align:middle line:84%
they talked about other
branches and other activity

00:06:32.620 --> 00:06:34.010 align:middle line:90%
within the nervous system.

00:06:34.010 --> 00:06:36.730 align:middle line:90%
They didn't have a name for it.

00:06:36.730 --> 00:06:39.490 align:middle line:84%
It's, I believe, since
Stephen Porges' work,

00:06:39.490 --> 00:06:41.260 align:middle line:84%
that it's actually
received a name, which

00:06:41.260 --> 00:06:43.490 align:middle line:90%
is this social network.

00:06:43.490 --> 00:06:47.680 align:middle line:84%
Now, if we look at it
as we've been evolving,

00:06:47.680 --> 00:06:52.480 align:middle line:84%
and we learn the activity
of our facial structures,

00:06:52.480 --> 00:06:55.900 align:middle line:84%
how we're responding, the
porosity of our voice,

00:06:55.900 --> 00:06:58.390 align:middle line:84%
meaning how we're
rhythmically we are connected

00:06:58.390 --> 00:07:03.250 align:middle line:84%
with our voice, how well we use
our ability to connect with one

00:07:03.250 --> 00:07:07.360 align:middle line:84%
another, that actually
creates an inner ear balance

00:07:07.360 --> 00:07:10.570 align:middle line:84%
and helps with a person
to be able to have

00:07:10.570 --> 00:07:13.820 align:middle line:84%
a sense of connection and
feel a sense of safety.

00:07:13.820 --> 00:07:15.130 align:middle line:90%
That's the key.

00:07:15.130 --> 00:07:17.812 align:middle line:84%
The social piece is
connected to safety.

00:07:17.812 --> 00:07:19.270 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: What is
this showing you?

00:07:19.270 --> 00:07:22.300 align:middle line:84%
What are you able to take
away from this in service

00:07:22.300 --> 00:07:23.615 align:middle line:90%
to your clients?

00:07:23.615 --> 00:07:25.240 align:middle line:84%
>>BARSOTTI: For those
that are mothers,

00:07:25.240 --> 00:07:29.170 align:middle line:84%
to really make sure that they
use their face expressions

00:07:29.170 --> 00:07:34.060 align:middle line:84%
a lot to connect with
their children with voice,

00:07:34.060 --> 00:07:37.540 align:middle line:84%
because it's the development
of this area of all

00:07:37.540 --> 00:07:42.970 align:middle line:84%
of the afferent, the parts
of the nerve sheath that are

00:07:42.970 --> 00:07:46.630 align:middle line:84%
growing up into the brain that
connect to the middle ear that

00:07:46.630 --> 00:07:51.580 align:middle line:84%
allow us to have an equilibrium,
both literally an equilibrium,

00:07:51.580 --> 00:07:53.337 align:middle line:84%
as well as a balanced
equilibrium in our--

00:07:53.337 --> 00:07:55.420 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Emotionally,
spiritually, and otherwise.

00:07:55.420 --> 00:07:55.855 align:middle line:90%
>>BARSOTTI: Emotionally.

00:07:55.855 --> 00:07:56.655 align:middle line:90%
Exactly.

00:07:56.655 --> 00:07:58.240 align:middle line:84%
And it gives you
a sense of safety.

00:07:58.240 --> 00:07:59.830 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And now
this really moves

00:07:59.830 --> 00:08:03.310 align:middle line:84%
us toward the subject
of mind, greater mind,

00:08:03.310 --> 00:08:06.060 align:middle line:84%
because mind is
permeating all of this.

00:08:06.060 --> 00:08:10.450 align:middle line:84%
Mind is permeating the nervous
pathways, the glandular

00:08:10.450 --> 00:08:12.770 align:middle line:90%
systems, the organic systems.

00:08:12.770 --> 00:08:15.160 align:middle line:84%
Let's speak about mind from
a different perspective

00:08:15.160 --> 00:08:16.913 align:middle line:84%
in the way that you're
understanding it.

00:08:16.913 --> 00:08:17.830 align:middle line:90%
>>BARSOTTI: Beautiful.

00:08:17.830 --> 00:08:20.530 align:middle line:84%
One thing I love
that Einstein said

00:08:20.530 --> 00:08:23.350 align:middle line:84%
close to his time of
death, is that it's

00:08:23.350 --> 00:08:25.405 align:middle line:90%
field before particle.

00:08:25.405 --> 00:08:26.205 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:08:26.205 --> 00:08:29.470 align:middle line:84%
>>BARSOTTI: And the mind
may be more of a field.

00:08:29.470 --> 00:08:30.550 align:middle line:90%
And Pen--

00:08:30.550 --> 00:08:31.950 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Should we
read that quote by Pen?

00:08:31.950 --> 00:08:32.360 align:middle line:90%
>>BARSOTTI: Sure.

00:08:32.360 --> 00:08:33.160 align:middle line:90%
Please do.

00:08:33.160 --> 00:08:36.010 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: --"admonished his
peers not to look for the mind

00:08:36.010 --> 00:08:36.940 align:middle line:90%
within the brain.

00:08:36.940 --> 00:08:39.190 align:middle line:84%
He had spent his
career searching

00:08:39.190 --> 00:08:40.480 align:middle line:90%
and could not find it there.

00:08:40.480 --> 00:08:43.059 align:middle line:84%
We may come to find that
neither consciousness,

00:08:43.059 --> 00:08:45.580 align:middle line:84%
nor Consciousness
with a capital C,

00:08:45.580 --> 00:08:47.860 align:middle line:84%
is under the control
of a single structure,

00:08:47.860 --> 00:08:52.630 align:middle line:84%
responding instead to reflexes
within axes of structures.

00:08:52.630 --> 00:08:54.323 align:middle line:90%
What does that mean?

00:08:54.323 --> 00:08:55.990 align:middle line:84%
>>BARSOTTI: That's a
mouthful, isn't it?

00:08:55.990 --> 00:08:56.980 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: It is.

00:08:56.980 --> 00:08:58.940 align:middle line:84%
>>BARSOTTI: So Penfield
Wilder, first of all,

00:08:58.940 --> 00:09:03.400 align:middle line:84%
he is just an amazing mind
in being able to advance

00:09:03.400 --> 00:09:04.740 align:middle line:90%
our neurosciences.

00:09:04.740 --> 00:09:07.690 align:middle line:84%
And he really had a great
respect for the mind.

00:09:07.690 --> 00:09:10.840 align:middle line:84%
So the point that I was
raising in that, bringing

00:09:10.840 --> 00:09:15.100 align:middle line:84%
in his comment, is if we
don't think of the mind

00:09:15.100 --> 00:09:18.910 align:middle line:84%
and consciousness so centrally
localized to the brain,

00:09:18.910 --> 00:09:20.770 align:middle line:84%
then how is it that
we could actually

00:09:20.770 --> 00:09:23.890 align:middle line:84%
be looking at these accesses
throughout our body,

00:09:23.890 --> 00:09:27.100 align:middle line:84%
whether we're talking about
the hypothalamus pituitary

00:09:27.100 --> 00:09:30.760 align:middle line:84%
adrenal access, whether we're
talking about these brain

00:09:30.760 --> 00:09:34.360 align:middle line:84%
accesses, there's all different
accesses throughout the body.

00:09:34.360 --> 00:09:40.030 align:middle line:84%
And for millennia in
looking at systems biology

00:09:40.030 --> 00:09:42.610 align:middle line:84%
and how ayurvedic
looks at it, Tibetan

00:09:42.610 --> 00:09:45.160 align:middle line:84%
medicine, Sufi
medicine, they've always

00:09:45.160 --> 00:09:48.160 align:middle line:84%
looked at these interchanges,
these crossroads of the body.

00:09:48.160 --> 00:09:49.158 align:middle line:90%
Those are accesses.

00:09:49.158 --> 00:09:50.950 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: To the mind,
to the greater mind.

00:09:50.950 --> 00:09:51.220 align:middle line:90%
>>BARSOTTI: To the mind.

00:09:51.220 --> 00:09:52.150 align:middle line:90%
That's right.

00:09:52.150 --> 00:09:54.143 align:middle line:84%
So what is your
relationship with spirit?

00:09:54.143 --> 00:09:55.810 align:middle line:84%
What is your relationship
with yourself?

00:09:55.810 --> 00:09:57.560 align:middle line:84%
What is your relationship
with your family

00:09:57.560 --> 00:09:58.940 align:middle line:90%
and your environment?

00:09:58.940 --> 00:10:02.170 align:middle line:84%
Those are the things that have
to do with all the information

00:10:02.170 --> 00:10:03.550 align:middle line:90%
that your mind is picking up.

00:10:03.550 --> 00:10:07.250 align:middle line:84%
If we think about the mind
being more field oriented,

00:10:07.250 --> 00:10:10.090 align:middle line:84%
we're constantly
picking up information.

00:10:10.090 --> 00:10:11.890 align:middle line:84%
You said earlier
something that is

00:10:11.890 --> 00:10:15.340 align:middle line:84%
key about how there's so many
bits and bytes that we're

00:10:15.340 --> 00:10:16.420 align:middle line:90%
picking up.

00:10:16.420 --> 00:10:20.740 align:middle line:90%
The number that is in Norretra--

00:10:20.740 --> 00:10:21.680 align:middle line:90%
it's "User Illusion."

00:10:21.680 --> 00:10:22.930 align:middle line:90%
I'm going to butcher his name.

00:10:22.930 --> 00:10:25.000 align:middle line:90%
So I won't say his name.

00:10:25.000 --> 00:10:27.950 align:middle line:84%
He spoke about how many nerve
endings there are and that

00:10:27.950 --> 00:10:28.750 align:middle line:90%
they're--

00:10:28.750 --> 00:10:32.320 align:middle line:84%
subconscious is actually
processing about 12 billion--

00:10:32.320 --> 00:10:36.320 align:middle line:84%
sorry, 12 million bits of
information per second.

00:10:36.320 --> 00:10:40.900 align:middle line:84%
Meanwhile, the cognitive brain
is only doing about 100--

00:10:40.900 --> 00:10:46.030 align:middle line:84%
I see the ranges between
134 and 183 bits per second.

00:10:46.030 --> 00:10:49.057 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So our field
is processing everything.

00:10:49.057 --> 00:10:49.890 align:middle line:90%
>>BARSOTTI: So much.

00:10:49.890 --> 00:10:51.460 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: It's processing sound.

00:10:51.460 --> 00:10:52.780 align:middle line:90%
It's processing light.

00:10:52.780 --> 00:10:54.520 align:middle line:90%
It's processing words.

00:10:54.520 --> 00:10:57.790 align:middle line:84%
It's processing frequencies
passing through our field.

00:10:57.790 --> 00:10:59.440 align:middle line:90%
It's processing all the time.

00:10:59.440 --> 00:11:01.878 align:middle line:84%
And we're consciously,
mostly unaware of it.

00:11:01.878 --> 00:11:02.920 align:middle line:90%
>>BARSOTTI: That's right.

00:11:02.920 --> 00:11:03.940 align:middle line:90%
That's right.

00:11:03.940 --> 00:11:07.190 align:middle line:84%
However, as we
increase our ability

00:11:07.190 --> 00:11:09.740 align:middle line:90%
and knowing ourselves as field--

00:11:09.740 --> 00:11:11.090 align:middle line:90%
some say bio field.

00:11:11.090 --> 00:11:12.170 align:middle line:90%
Some say aura.

00:11:12.170 --> 00:11:14.420 align:middle line:84%
Some say-- there's all these
different terms around it

00:11:14.420 --> 00:11:15.650 align:middle line:90%
these days.

00:11:15.650 --> 00:11:21.170 align:middle line:84%
If we can see that there are
aspects to ourselves that

00:11:21.170 --> 00:11:23.210 align:middle line:84%
go far beyond,
there's some people

00:11:23.210 --> 00:11:26.770 align:middle line:84%
that say for as far as your
arms can go high and wide,

00:11:26.770 --> 00:11:28.610 align:middle line:90%
is as big as your field.

00:11:28.610 --> 00:11:31.250 align:middle line:84%
And so that is
processing information.

00:11:31.250 --> 00:11:34.460 align:middle line:84%
One of my personal
curiosities is

00:11:34.460 --> 00:11:38.660 align:middle line:84%
can we process information
that happens out here before it

00:11:38.660 --> 00:11:41.630 align:middle line:90%
happens in here, ideally?

00:11:41.630 --> 00:11:45.380 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Because it happens
here first, out there first,

00:11:45.380 --> 00:11:48.320 align:middle line:84%
but the transference
is so quick.

00:11:48.320 --> 00:11:49.940 align:middle line:90%
So let's talk about that.

00:11:49.940 --> 00:11:51.170 align:middle line:90%
You're working with clients.

00:11:51.170 --> 00:11:53.720 align:middle line:84%
And you can see
disruptions in field.

00:11:53.720 --> 00:11:56.090 align:middle line:90%
You can see blown out fields.

00:11:56.090 --> 00:11:58.820 align:middle line:84%
You can see areas where there's
no more protection in a field,

00:11:58.820 --> 00:11:59.930 align:middle line:90%
and so forth.

00:11:59.930 --> 00:12:02.960 align:middle line:84%
How do you begin
working with restoring

00:12:02.960 --> 00:12:06.260 align:middle line:84%
the field or the interface with
the greater mind, the higher

00:12:06.260 --> 00:12:10.610 align:middle line:84%
mind into the more
matter-oriented aspects

00:12:10.610 --> 00:12:11.840 align:middle line:90%
of our life, the physical?

00:12:11.840 --> 00:12:15.110 align:middle line:84%
>>BARSOTTI: So depending
on what it is, sometimes

00:12:15.110 --> 00:12:16.760 align:middle line:90%
I won't begin out here.

00:12:16.760 --> 00:12:21.560 align:middle line:84%
I'll actually begin where
our central nervous system,

00:12:21.560 --> 00:12:24.680 align:middle line:84%
bringing choice back
to your awareness,

00:12:24.680 --> 00:12:27.080 align:middle line:84%
because where we put our
attention-- once again,

00:12:27.080 --> 00:12:29.540 align:middle line:84%
this is using the reticular
activating system--

00:12:29.540 --> 00:12:32.390 align:middle line:84%
where we put our
attention is where

00:12:32.390 --> 00:12:35.510 align:middle line:90%
we tend to be bringing more in.

00:12:35.510 --> 00:12:38.745 align:middle line:84%
And so I will make
someone aware of,

00:12:38.745 --> 00:12:40.370 align:middle line:84%
whether it's through
one of the devices

00:12:40.370 --> 00:12:43.550 align:middle line:84%
that I use to help
them see, or I'm

00:12:43.550 --> 00:12:46.820 align:middle line:84%
helping them see or
feel for themself,

00:12:46.820 --> 00:12:50.390 align:middle line:84%
what is actually going on
and say what happened here.

00:12:50.390 --> 00:12:51.860 align:middle line:90%
And we'll usually get a story.

00:12:51.860 --> 00:12:54.410 align:middle line:84%
We'll usually get
something as an entree.

00:12:54.410 --> 00:12:57.320 align:middle line:84%
Oh, this trauma happened here,
oh, this damage, oh, there it

00:12:57.320 --> 00:12:58.880 align:middle line:90%
brings up a memory.

00:12:58.880 --> 00:13:02.720 align:middle line:84%
So it's once again, it's
very personal and individual.

00:13:02.720 --> 00:13:05.570 align:middle line:84%
And then I will begin,
usually, from the inside out.

00:13:05.570 --> 00:13:07.470 align:middle line:84%
What choice did you
make in that moment?

00:13:07.470 --> 00:13:09.500 align:middle line:84%
Because you either
lost energy, and you're

00:13:09.500 --> 00:13:10.692 align:middle line:90%
draining energy from there.

00:13:10.692 --> 00:13:12.650 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Is this almost
like the trauma that's

00:13:12.650 --> 00:13:15.470 align:middle line:84%
trapped inside,
both inside the body

00:13:15.470 --> 00:13:17.090 align:middle line:84%
and the greater mind
at the same time?

00:13:17.090 --> 00:13:18.132 align:middle line:90%
>>BARSOTTI: That's right.

00:13:18.132 --> 00:13:19.040 align:middle line:90%
That's right.

00:13:19.040 --> 00:13:24.290 align:middle line:84%
So if we can heal by realizing
that we've put our mind,

00:13:24.290 --> 00:13:29.570 align:middle line:84%
our attention, our focus,
in a certain area and caused

00:13:29.570 --> 00:13:32.562 align:middle line:84%
something to happen to us,
then we have to also realize--

00:13:32.562 --> 00:13:34.520 align:middle line:84%
whether or not you want
to take responsibility,

00:13:34.520 --> 00:13:35.780 align:middle line:90%
it doesn't matter--

00:13:35.780 --> 00:13:39.410 align:middle line:84%
whether we can actually see
that our choice has the ability

00:13:39.410 --> 00:13:42.120 align:middle line:84%
to affect what
happens in the future.

00:13:42.120 --> 00:13:44.900 align:middle line:84%
So then if you
are-- we will likely

00:13:44.900 --> 00:13:47.300 align:middle line:84%
be in a similar
situation in the future,

00:13:47.300 --> 00:13:50.370 align:middle line:84%
so that when you are in that
situation in the future,

00:13:50.370 --> 00:13:51.470 align:middle line:90%
you will have the skills.

00:13:51.470 --> 00:13:52.430 align:middle line:90%
You will be adept.

00:13:52.430 --> 00:13:56.090 align:middle line:84%
You will know what to do and how
to adapt yourself differently.

00:13:56.090 --> 00:13:58.130 align:middle line:84%
But onset after
onset, if you've got

00:13:58.130 --> 00:14:00.620 align:middle line:84%
a weak spot in your
auric field, and you

00:14:00.620 --> 00:14:02.930 align:middle line:84%
keep getting slammed
there, it's likely

00:14:02.930 --> 00:14:06.350 align:middle line:84%
going to create another kind
of organ different damage.

00:14:06.350 --> 00:14:07.400 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:14:07.400 --> 00:14:10.820 align:middle line:84%
How, when we're looking at
this great field of mind,

00:14:10.820 --> 00:14:13.970 align:middle line:84%
how often do you see where,
actually, past lives have

00:14:13.970 --> 00:14:17.190 align:middle line:84%
played into whatever the
physical circumstances

00:14:17.190 --> 00:14:17.990 align:middle line:90%
at this time?

00:14:17.990 --> 00:14:19.740 align:middle line:84%
>>BARSOTTI: It's quite
frequent, actually,

00:14:19.740 --> 00:14:21.170 align:middle line:90%
that there's a lot that's there.

00:14:21.170 --> 00:14:24.710 align:middle line:84%
And it used to be that
after my training,

00:14:24.710 --> 00:14:31.113 align:middle line:84%
that I would spend a good
amount of time beginning there.

00:14:31.113 --> 00:14:32.030 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Interesting.

00:14:32.030 --> 00:14:33.570 align:middle line:84%
>>BARSOTTI: And now
I don't anymore.

00:14:33.570 --> 00:14:38.460 align:middle line:84%
I actually just let the process
begin where it needs to begin.

00:14:38.460 --> 00:14:41.570 align:middle line:84%
And if we are taken, because the
body's innate intelligence will

00:14:41.570 --> 00:14:45.570 align:middle line:84%
take us there, where it's
ready to heal in that time,

00:14:45.570 --> 00:14:48.860 align:middle line:84%
then it will be the right time
to go and dig that stuff up.

00:14:48.860 --> 00:14:50.900 align:middle line:84%
But if I begin
there, and I what I

00:14:50.900 --> 00:14:53.060 align:middle line:84%
have found, if the
person doesn't have

00:14:53.060 --> 00:14:54.698 align:middle line:84%
the tools and the
cognitive ability

00:14:54.698 --> 00:14:56.990 align:middle line:84%
to be able to deal with the
fact that we just opened up

00:14:56.990 --> 00:15:00.600 align:middle line:84%
this whole other part of them,
and they're not ready for it,

00:15:00.600 --> 00:15:02.300 align:middle line:90%
it's not a good thing either.

00:15:02.300 --> 00:15:06.740 align:middle line:84%
So and for past life, for some
people that maybe don't believe

00:15:06.740 --> 00:15:08.690 align:middle line:90%
in that, we all have a lineage.

00:15:08.690 --> 00:15:10.160 align:middle line:90%
We all have a--

00:15:10.160 --> 00:15:11.910 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Call it
your parents, exactly.

00:15:11.910 --> 00:15:13.650 align:middle line:84%
>>BARSOTTI: --of
how we got here.

00:15:13.650 --> 00:15:18.330 align:middle line:84%
So unfinished business runs
the span throughout time.

00:15:18.330 --> 00:15:21.020 align:middle line:84%
So whether you're seeing it from
a past life or just something

00:15:21.020 --> 00:15:23.780 align:middle line:84%
that your mom maybe
didn't get done,

00:15:23.780 --> 00:15:26.060 align:middle line:84%
so there's still
healing that can happen.

00:15:26.060 --> 00:15:28.160 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Speaking of
mom, a lot of this also

00:15:28.160 --> 00:15:30.180 align:middle line:84%
is instigated during
the birth process.

00:15:30.180 --> 00:15:30.980 align:middle line:90%
>>BARSOTTI: Yes.

00:15:30.980 --> 00:15:32.660 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And let's
go there for a bit

00:15:32.660 --> 00:15:38.043 align:middle line:84%
before we go on to kind of the
science, the detection devices,

00:15:38.043 --> 00:15:40.460 align:middle line:84%
the some of them that you use,
and what the future's going

00:15:40.460 --> 00:15:44.000 align:middle line:84%
to look like for detecting all
of this in the greater field.

00:15:44.000 --> 00:15:45.050 align:middle line:90%
>>BARSOTTI: Beautiful.

00:15:45.050 --> 00:15:47.540 align:middle line:90%
In utero time is so important.

00:15:47.540 --> 00:15:51.440 align:middle line:84%
The way we do birth is
oftentimes the way we do life,

00:15:51.440 --> 00:15:54.450 align:middle line:84%
so meaning that we are,
it's our first entry.

00:15:54.450 --> 00:15:56.630 align:middle line:90%
And it's our first--

00:15:56.630 --> 00:15:59.000 align:middle line:84%
and if we've had a
rough birth, then we

00:15:59.000 --> 00:16:02.130 align:middle line:84%
may need to start things
that may not be always easy.

00:16:02.130 --> 00:16:02.930 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:16:02.930 --> 00:16:06.660 align:middle line:84%
What would you do about a baby
who arrives tail end first?

00:16:06.660 --> 00:16:09.652 align:middle line:84%
Frank breech birth, for example,
what would that indicate?

00:16:09.652 --> 00:16:10.860 align:middle line:90%
>>BARSOTTI: So in a session--

00:16:10.860 --> 00:16:12.110 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: With the butt first?

00:16:12.110 --> 00:16:15.960 align:middle line:84%
>>BARSOTTI: Yeah, so they may
need to do things opposite.

00:16:15.960 --> 00:16:18.030 align:middle line:90%
They may even be dyslexic.

00:16:18.030 --> 00:16:18.990 align:middle line:90%
They may be--

00:16:18.990 --> 00:16:21.733 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: I arrived that way,
and all those things are true.

00:16:21.733 --> 00:16:22.650 align:middle line:90%
>>BARSOTTI: Very good.

00:16:22.650 --> 00:16:25.215 align:middle line:90%
So you're essentially, you may--

00:16:25.215 --> 00:16:27.090 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Do everything
backwards, even wired

00:16:27.090 --> 00:16:28.297 align:middle line:90%
backwards, energetically.

00:16:28.297 --> 00:16:29.130 align:middle line:90%
>>BARSOTTI: Exactly.

00:16:29.130 --> 00:16:30.470 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: So that's perfect.

00:16:30.470 --> 00:16:31.803 align:middle line:90%
I'm glad I didn't tell you that.

00:16:31.803 --> 00:16:33.060 align:middle line:90%
But yeah, yeah.

00:16:33.060 --> 00:16:35.070 align:middle line:90%
>>BARSOTTI: So there's a big--

00:16:35.070 --> 00:16:38.520 align:middle line:84%
we actually begin our karma
in this lifetime at our birth.

00:16:38.520 --> 00:16:41.070 align:middle line:84%
And it is a life
and death moment.

00:16:41.070 --> 00:16:43.440 align:middle line:84%
And something that I think
is so important for us

00:16:43.440 --> 00:16:45.630 align:middle line:84%
to remember when
babies are born, too,

00:16:45.630 --> 00:16:49.020 align:middle line:84%
before we cut the
umbilical cord,

00:16:49.020 --> 00:16:52.380 align:middle line:84%
if it's possible, if it's
not an emergency situation,

00:16:52.380 --> 00:16:54.550 align:middle line:90%
to let the cord settle.

00:16:54.550 --> 00:16:57.990 align:middle line:84%
Let the baby just
rest on mother's chest

00:16:57.990 --> 00:17:02.400 align:middle line:84%
and feel a rhythm, feel
breath, field life, because--

00:17:02.400 --> 00:17:03.610 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Feel the field.

00:17:03.610 --> 00:17:04.410 align:middle line:90%
>>BARSOTTI: Yes.

00:17:04.410 --> 00:17:07.260 align:middle line:84%
And then cut the cord and say,
OK, baby, you're on your own.

00:17:07.260 --> 00:17:09.599 align:middle line:84%
You're breathing
now for yourself.

00:17:09.599 --> 00:17:11.339 align:middle line:90%
You're not attached to me.

00:17:11.339 --> 00:17:14.900 align:middle line:84%
Your food is not based
on only me anymore.

00:17:14.900 --> 00:17:15.700 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:17:15.700 --> 00:17:20.170 align:middle line:84%
One other, when people, when
babies come out feet first?

00:17:20.170 --> 00:17:24.352 align:middle line:84%
>>BARSOTTI: So it's kind
of similar in that they may

00:17:24.352 --> 00:17:25.560 align:middle line:90%
need to do things feet first.

00:17:25.560 --> 00:17:28.980 align:middle line:84%
They may need to do from
backwards, almost from

00:17:28.980 --> 00:17:29.855 align:middle line:90%
and to the beginning.

00:17:29.855 --> 00:17:32.105 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So all of these
things are symbolic, the way

00:17:32.105 --> 00:17:33.300 align:middle line:90%
the baby positions itself.

00:17:33.300 --> 00:17:35.760 align:middle line:90%
>>BARSOTTI: Yes, absolutely.

00:17:35.760 --> 00:17:37.950 align:middle line:84%
There's a lot of choice
with how babies come in.

00:17:37.950 --> 00:17:40.788 align:middle line:84%
It's not conscious,
it's unconscious choice.

00:17:40.788 --> 00:17:42.330 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And
sometimes the best laid

00:17:42.330 --> 00:17:44.710 align:middle line:84%
plans-- we both have
a mutual friend who

00:17:44.710 --> 00:17:47.250 align:middle line:84%
just had a baby a
couple days ago,

00:17:47.250 --> 00:17:51.810 align:middle line:84%
and healthy, picture perfect
mom, a baby developing very

00:17:51.810 --> 00:17:53.970 align:middle line:84%
nicely, and at the
last minute, everything

00:17:53.970 --> 00:17:57.240 align:middle line:84%
goes sideways, totally
not what they expected,

00:17:57.240 --> 00:17:58.188 align:middle line:90%
not what they wanted.

00:17:58.188 --> 00:17:59.730 align:middle line:84%
But I've seen this
happen quite a bit

00:17:59.730 --> 00:18:02.963 align:middle line:84%
with super conscientious
healthy moms in particular.

00:18:02.963 --> 00:18:04.380 align:middle line:84%
I've seen this
happen a few times.

00:18:04.380 --> 00:18:05.940 align:middle line:90%
What's up with that?

00:18:05.940 --> 00:18:08.580 align:middle line:84%
>>BARSOTTI: The baby
had his own contract.

00:18:08.580 --> 00:18:10.080 align:middle line:90%
It's not about what we do.

00:18:10.080 --> 00:18:11.747 align:middle line:84%
And this is a really
good thing for us--

00:18:11.747 --> 00:18:13.788 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And to not beat
ourselves up over that,

00:18:13.788 --> 00:18:14.770 align:middle line:90%
because it's--

00:18:14.770 --> 00:18:15.840 align:middle line:90%
>>BARSOTTI: Yes, don't.

00:18:15.840 --> 00:18:16.640 align:middle line:90%
No.

00:18:16.640 --> 00:18:21.660 align:middle line:84%
It's just another opportunity
for unconditional love, always,

00:18:21.660 --> 00:18:24.060 align:middle line:84%
and that we have to
just love these babies,

00:18:24.060 --> 00:18:26.730 align:middle line:84%
and even though our
mutual friend also

00:18:26.730 --> 00:18:30.160 align:middle line:84%
has realized that there's a
choice for that baby and how--

00:18:30.160 --> 00:18:30.960 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Exactly.

00:18:30.960 --> 00:18:32.130 align:middle line:90%
It could be a timing issue.

00:18:32.130 --> 00:18:33.797 align:middle line:84%
The baby doesn't want
to be born or does

00:18:33.797 --> 00:18:37.650 align:middle line:84%
want to be born under a specific
kind of cosmic influence.

00:18:37.650 --> 00:18:38.580 align:middle line:90%
It could be anything.

00:18:38.580 --> 00:18:39.850 align:middle line:90%
>>BARSOTTI: Exactly, Exactly.

00:18:39.850 --> 00:18:40.800 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So I just
thought I'd ask about that.

00:18:40.800 --> 00:18:41.430 align:middle line:84%
>>BARSOTTI: But it
is all healable.

00:18:41.430 --> 00:18:42.540 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Yes,
it's all healable.

00:18:42.540 --> 00:18:44.260 align:middle line:84%
>>BARSOTTI: So later
on, when you do--

00:18:44.260 --> 00:18:45.330 align:middle line:90%
if it's necessary.

00:18:45.330 --> 00:18:47.820 align:middle line:84%
Not everything is
necessary-- but in a session,

00:18:47.820 --> 00:18:51.000 align:middle line:84%
you go into what I
actually call de-hypnosis.

00:18:51.000 --> 00:18:54.000 align:middle line:84%
And you go into
this state where you

00:18:54.000 --> 00:18:56.282 align:middle line:90%
remember your birth process.

00:18:56.282 --> 00:18:57.990 align:middle line:84%
And you change your
relationship with it.

00:18:57.990 --> 00:18:59.530 align:middle line:90%
And you actually can reframe it.

00:18:59.530 --> 00:19:01.530 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: That's interesting,
because as I said,

00:19:01.530 --> 00:19:05.180 align:middle line:84%
I came out frank
breach, as it's called.

00:19:05.180 --> 00:19:06.930 align:middle line:84%
But I have been back
through that process.

00:19:06.930 --> 00:19:09.000 align:middle line:84%
And I remember
feeling before birth,

00:19:09.000 --> 00:19:11.340 align:middle line:90%
do I really want to do this one?

00:19:11.340 --> 00:19:14.220 align:middle line:84%
It was like, there was
going to be a lot of work.

00:19:14.220 --> 00:19:17.280 align:middle line:84%
And do I really-- it was just
kind of that last hesitation

00:19:17.280 --> 00:19:19.088 align:middle line:84%
before you step into
the game, so to speak.

00:19:19.088 --> 00:19:20.130 align:middle line:90%
>>BARSOTTI: That's right.

00:19:20.130 --> 00:19:21.480 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: So and then, I do.

00:19:21.480 --> 00:19:24.000 align:middle line:84%
I find that other people who
have gone through this process

00:19:24.000 --> 00:19:26.200 align:middle line:84%
find it quite
valuable to know what

00:19:26.200 --> 00:19:28.870 align:middle line:84%
the feelings were in the
environment just prior

00:19:28.870 --> 00:19:29.670 align:middle line:90%
to birth.

00:19:29.670 --> 00:19:32.040 align:middle line:84%
It tells you a lot about what
your life is going to be.

00:19:32.040 --> 00:19:33.040 align:middle line:90%
>>BARSOTTI: That's true.

00:19:33.040 --> 00:19:33.760 align:middle line:90%
That's very true.

00:19:33.760 --> 00:19:35.593 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: It is reflective
of what has been.

00:19:35.593 --> 00:19:38.250 align:middle line:84%
Now we get to the
fun stuff about you

00:19:38.250 --> 00:19:41.730 align:middle line:84%
had mentioned very briefly in
passing, some of the devices

00:19:41.730 --> 00:19:44.190 align:middle line:84%
that are used to be able
to show this incredibly

00:19:44.190 --> 00:19:48.540 align:middle line:84%
complex picture of
health and field

00:19:48.540 --> 00:19:50.460 align:middle line:90%
and so forth to the client.

00:19:50.460 --> 00:19:54.550 align:middle line:10%
And one of them is the GVD
device, or the Bio-Well device,

00:19:54.550 --> 00:19:56.880 align:middle line:10%
which actually Gaia
is now in partnership

00:19:56.880 --> 00:20:00.270 align:middle line:10%
with Konstantin Korotkov in
creating this so that it's

00:20:00.270 --> 00:20:02.770 align:middle line:10%
very available to the public.

00:20:02.770 --> 00:20:04.080 align:middle line:10%
How do you use this device?

00:20:04.080 --> 00:20:05.270 align:middle line:10%
How does this work?

00:20:05.270 --> 00:20:07.560 align:middle line:10%
>>BARSOTTI: So clinically
and in research both.

00:20:07.560 --> 00:20:11.585 align:middle line:84%
And I've been using the
GDV now for plus 10 years.

00:20:11.585 --> 00:20:13.710 align:middle line:84%
So there's actually a fair
amount of research on it

00:20:13.710 --> 00:20:17.130 align:middle line:84%
that's mostly been done in
Russia, some here as well.

00:20:17.130 --> 00:20:19.710 align:middle line:84%
So what it's doing
is taking a picture

00:20:19.710 --> 00:20:21.300 align:middle line:90%
of the end of the fingertips.

00:20:21.300 --> 00:20:25.260 align:middle line:84%
And it's looking at--
so you know this.

00:20:25.260 --> 00:20:27.150 align:middle line:84%
And probably most
of the audience

00:20:27.150 --> 00:20:30.360 align:middle line:84%
knows this-- that
the meridians end

00:20:30.360 --> 00:20:32.130 align:middle line:90%
at the fingertips and the toes.

00:20:32.130 --> 00:20:35.340 align:middle line:84%
And so what we're taking
a picture of is this gas

00:20:35.340 --> 00:20:37.765 align:middle line:90%
discharge exchange with this--

00:20:37.765 --> 00:20:40.140 align:middle line:84%
I'm not going to get into the
physics of the whole thing.

00:20:40.140 --> 00:20:42.690 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: It shows you a picture
of, essentially, your aura.

00:20:42.690 --> 00:20:43.170 align:middle line:90%
>>BARSOTTI: Yes.

00:20:43.170 --> 00:20:44.280 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And your
energy centers.

00:20:44.280 --> 00:20:45.080 align:middle line:90%
>>BARSOTTI: Yes.

00:20:45.080 --> 00:20:46.380 align:middle line:90%
So it gives you the chakras.

00:20:46.380 --> 00:20:49.860 align:middle line:84%
It gives you-- and
these are pixilated

00:20:49.860 --> 00:20:55.140 align:middle line:84%
views, these kind of dots that
make it look like your aura.

00:20:55.140 --> 00:20:58.080 align:middle line:84%
And they map to organs
and systems in the body.

00:20:58.080 --> 00:21:00.720 align:middle line:84%
So it shows you how
you're managing stress

00:21:00.720 --> 00:21:04.470 align:middle line:84%
and how you are managing
and adapting through all

00:21:04.470 --> 00:21:06.020 align:middle line:90%
of your organs and systems.

00:21:06.020 --> 00:21:12.120 align:middle line:84%
So it's great to give a
visual assistant to my clients

00:21:12.120 --> 00:21:15.870 align:middle line:84%
or somebody that just needs to
see what's actually going on.

00:21:15.870 --> 00:21:18.300 align:middle line:84%
And when we're in--
and it's very dynamic.

00:21:18.300 --> 00:21:22.710 align:middle line:84%
So when we're in a state,
and we take a measurement,

00:21:22.710 --> 00:21:25.750 align:middle line:84%
you're getting a snapshot
in that moment in time.

00:21:25.750 --> 00:21:28.080 align:middle line:84%
So if something happens,
say you do a healing,

00:21:28.080 --> 00:21:29.810 align:middle line:84%
which isn't going
in a positive way,

00:21:29.810 --> 00:21:33.620 align:middle line:84%
or some trauma happens,
and you take a GDV,

00:21:33.620 --> 00:21:38.550 align:middle line:84%
it will be obvious in the
results of what you're seeing.

00:21:38.550 --> 00:21:40.250 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: And how do your--

00:21:40.250 --> 00:21:41.850 align:middle line:90%
I just, I'm dyslexic.

00:21:41.850 --> 00:21:43.190 align:middle line:90%
I said GVD I think.

00:21:43.190 --> 00:21:43.990 align:middle line:90%
>>BARSOTTI: GDV.

00:21:43.990 --> 00:21:45.760 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Yeah, I
think I said a GVD.

00:21:45.760 --> 00:21:47.530 align:middle line:90%
I do that all the time.

00:21:47.530 --> 00:21:49.190 align:middle line:84%
So how do your clients
respond to this?

00:21:49.190 --> 00:21:50.440 align:middle line:90%
>>BARSOTTI: It's very helpful.

00:21:50.440 --> 00:21:51.857 align:middle line:84%
So it's like a
light bulb goes on.

00:21:51.857 --> 00:21:54.510 align:middle line:84%
Oh, you mean-- and
so oftentimes, we

00:21:54.510 --> 00:21:57.080 align:middle line:84%
can see it this big
blast at the thyroid.

00:21:57.080 --> 00:22:03.000 align:middle line:84%
Or we can see something like
a missing area in the adrenals

00:22:03.000 --> 00:22:07.980 align:middle line:84%
or see a missing area or a
really large plume of energy

00:22:07.980 --> 00:22:11.663 align:middle line:84%
off the hypothalamus
that's giving us--

00:22:11.663 --> 00:22:12.830 align:middle line:90%
and there's ways to read it.

00:22:12.830 --> 00:22:14.622 align:middle line:84%
So we're looking at
the color that's there.

00:22:14.622 --> 00:22:19.140 align:middle line:84%
We're looking at the amount of
energy that's there and seeing,

00:22:19.140 --> 00:22:20.460 align:middle line:90%
is it healthy energy?

00:22:20.460 --> 00:22:23.130 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Yes, so this is one
of these beautiful crossover

00:22:23.130 --> 00:22:26.430 align:middle line:84%
devices that is beginning
to show us within the field.

00:22:26.430 --> 00:22:30.270 align:middle line:84%
So we can see prior to it taking
really deep root into the body

00:22:30.270 --> 00:22:31.630 align:middle line:90%
and start taking action.

00:22:31.630 --> 00:22:32.770 align:middle line:90%
I mean, it's really lovely.

00:22:32.770 --> 00:22:33.990 align:middle line:84%
And we only have a
couple of minutes

00:22:33.990 --> 00:22:36.240 align:middle line:84%
left, but if you could tell
us a little bit about what

00:22:36.240 --> 00:22:37.897 align:middle line:90%
you see as--

00:22:37.897 --> 00:22:39.480 align:middle line:84%
we were going to
talk about the notion

00:22:39.480 --> 00:22:43.110 align:middle line:84%
of the development of
cross-platform validation

00:22:43.110 --> 00:22:44.400 align:middle line:90%
in the world of science.

00:22:44.400 --> 00:22:47.340 align:middle line:84%
Because right now,
you have allopathic

00:22:47.340 --> 00:22:48.660 align:middle line:90%
and you have non-allopathic.

00:22:48.660 --> 00:22:50.235 align:middle line:84%
And the two don't
really cross over.

00:22:50.235 --> 00:22:52.110 align:middle line:84%
And you get-- your doctor
tells you one thing

00:22:52.110 --> 00:22:53.400 align:middle line:90%
and scares you to death.

00:22:53.400 --> 00:22:57.300 align:middle line:84%
You go to your alternative
practitioner of some kind.

00:22:57.300 --> 00:23:00.900 align:middle line:84%
They say, no, you are all right,
just need some supplements.

00:23:00.900 --> 00:23:01.860 align:middle line:90%
So where are we going?

00:23:01.860 --> 00:23:03.150 align:middle line:90%
Talk about this crossover.

00:23:03.150 --> 00:23:04.590 align:middle line:84%
>>BARSOTTI: First of all,
I have a lot of compassion

00:23:04.590 --> 00:23:05.820 align:middle line:90%
for the doctors right now.

00:23:05.820 --> 00:23:07.702 align:middle line:84%
There are a lot who
really do believe,

00:23:07.702 --> 00:23:09.660 align:middle line:84%
and because they have an
M.D. after their name,

00:23:09.660 --> 00:23:11.740 align:middle line:84%
they have to practice
standard of care.

00:23:11.740 --> 00:23:13.380 align:middle line:90%
So I have a lot of compassion.

00:23:13.380 --> 00:23:15.780 align:middle line:84%
For those that do have the
Open Minds that actually want

00:23:15.780 --> 00:23:18.540 align:middle line:84%
to branch into these areas
and those that are willing,

00:23:18.540 --> 00:23:20.370 align:middle line:84%
there are tools to
be able to start

00:23:20.370 --> 00:23:24.060 align:middle line:90%
to look into these things.

00:23:24.060 --> 00:23:26.550 align:middle line:84%
I happen to work
alongside several M.D.

00:23:26.550 --> 00:23:29.520 align:middle line:84%
And naturopathic
doctors, osteopaths,

00:23:29.520 --> 00:23:31.710 align:middle line:84%
and all kinds of other
allied health professionals

00:23:31.710 --> 00:23:33.300 align:middle line:90%
that are in this area.

00:23:33.300 --> 00:23:38.160 align:middle line:84%
So I'm in a unique position of
educating them and showing them

00:23:38.160 --> 00:23:38.960 align:middle line:90%
what we can see.

00:23:38.960 --> 00:23:40.530 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And seeing
cross-validation.

00:23:40.530 --> 00:23:41.488 align:middle line:90%
>>BARSOTTI: Absolutely.

00:23:41.488 --> 00:23:45.570 align:middle line:84%
And so the idea with this
cross platform validation

00:23:45.570 --> 00:23:49.260 align:middle line:84%
is that we will
build a lab that is

00:23:49.260 --> 00:23:52.890 align:middle line:84%
able to look at many of
these devices to see,

00:23:52.890 --> 00:23:54.570 align:middle line:84%
this one tells us
this over here.

00:23:54.570 --> 00:23:56.190 align:middle line:90%
And this one tells us this.

00:23:56.190 --> 00:23:57.600 align:middle line:90%
Where do they correlate?

00:23:57.600 --> 00:23:59.790 align:middle line:84%
And also against
gold standard, so

00:23:59.790 --> 00:24:05.350 align:middle line:84%
if we've been using EKG for
heart health for a long time,

00:24:05.350 --> 00:24:08.250 align:middle line:84%
how else can we maybe use some
of these other devices that

00:24:08.250 --> 00:24:10.590 align:middle line:84%
may be giving us just
a different subtlety

00:24:10.590 --> 00:24:14.380 align:middle line:84%
and a different finesse on
the same type of information?

00:24:14.380 --> 00:24:16.590 align:middle line:84%
So we have loads of
stories with the GDV

00:24:16.590 --> 00:24:20.730 align:middle line:84%
and the Bio-Well of people
getting their image taken

00:24:20.730 --> 00:24:23.610 align:middle line:84%
and saying, go check
out your heart.

00:24:23.610 --> 00:24:25.410 align:middle line:84%
And the EKG didn't
pick up anything.

00:24:25.410 --> 00:24:27.267 align:middle line:84%
But maybe a year or
two later, it did.

00:24:27.267 --> 00:24:29.850 align:middle line:84%
>>BARSOTTI: Right, because it's
reading the more subtle field.

00:24:29.850 --> 00:24:32.125 align:middle line:84%
And there's Konstantin
Korotkov, who

00:24:32.125 --> 00:24:34.500 align:middle line:84%
I think we all adore for the
work he's done in the world,

00:24:34.500 --> 00:24:35.955 align:middle line:90%
and an adorable human being.

00:24:35.955 --> 00:24:37.830 align:middle line:84%
Anybody that's interested,
I did an interview

00:24:37.830 --> 00:24:39.480 align:middle line:90%
with him a few years ago.

00:24:39.480 --> 00:24:42.010 align:middle line:84%
So they'll find that in
the CMN archives here.

00:24:42.010 --> 00:24:43.920 align:middle line:84%
But he worked on this
for what, 20 years?

00:24:43.920 --> 00:24:44.940 align:middle line:90%
>>BARSOTTI: Yes, more than now.

00:24:44.940 --> 00:24:46.315 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: I mean,
he's brilliant,

00:24:46.315 --> 00:24:48.600 align:middle line:84%
Soviet Academy of Sciences,
brilliant, brilliant man.

00:24:48.600 --> 00:24:48.990 align:middle line:90%
>>BARSOTTI: Yes, we're lucky.

00:24:48.990 --> 00:24:50.850 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So that's where
that science is coming from.

00:24:50.850 --> 00:24:51.540 align:middle line:90%
It's solid.

00:24:51.540 --> 00:24:52.350 align:middle line:90%
>>BARSOTTI: It is very solid.

00:24:52.350 --> 00:24:53.490 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: subtle, but solid.

00:24:53.490 --> 00:24:55.090 align:middle line:84%
And that's really more
where we're moving.

00:24:55.090 --> 00:24:56.923 align:middle line:84%
>>BARSOTTI: And it's
different mathematical.

00:24:56.923 --> 00:24:59.320 align:middle line:84%
So and just to say on
this note that there

00:24:59.320 --> 00:25:01.800 align:middle line:84%
is a practice of
medicine that I am

00:25:01.800 --> 00:25:04.120 align:middle line:90%
a fellow of called endobiogeny.

00:25:04.120 --> 00:25:05.940 align:middle line:90%
And it's systems biology.

00:25:05.940 --> 00:25:08.190 align:middle line:84%
And I am able to
see blood correlate

00:25:08.190 --> 00:25:12.420 align:middle line:84%
with the numbers and the
values that we see in the GDV.

00:25:12.420 --> 00:25:14.640 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So it's another
way of viewing blood?

00:25:14.640 --> 00:25:15.892 align:middle line:90%
>>BARSOTTI: Yes.

00:25:15.892 --> 00:25:17.100 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: That's interesting.

00:25:17.100 --> 00:25:19.020 align:middle line:84%
That's almost another
conversation, isn't it?

00:25:19.020 --> 00:25:19.330 align:middle line:90%
>>BARSOTTI: It is.

00:25:19.330 --> 00:25:19.770 align:middle line:90%
It is.

00:25:19.770 --> 00:25:22.062 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Goodness, and we've
chewed right past-- we've

00:25:22.062 --> 00:25:23.773 align:middle line:90%
blown right past our exit time.

00:25:23.773 --> 00:25:24.690 align:middle line:90%
It's been so much fun.

00:25:24.690 --> 00:25:25.490 align:middle line:90%
>>BARSOTTI: Did we?

00:25:25.490 --> 00:25:26.370 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Oh, yeah.

00:25:26.370 --> 00:25:27.660 align:middle line:90%
Any final thoughts for us?

00:25:27.660 --> 00:25:31.560 align:middle line:84%
I know that we touched on
it, some mobile technologies

00:25:31.560 --> 00:25:34.770 align:middle line:84%
coming out Michio Kaku and I
don't know if it was "Visions."

00:25:34.770 --> 00:25:38.820 align:middle line:84%
But one of his books about 15
years ago talked about 50, 150,

00:25:38.820 --> 00:25:41.800 align:middle line:84%
and on into the future and
what science would look like.

00:25:41.800 --> 00:25:44.280 align:middle line:84%
And one of them that
stuck was our toilets

00:25:44.280 --> 00:25:47.580 align:middle line:84%
would be able to reflect back
all of our biological data

00:25:47.580 --> 00:25:49.390 align:middle line:90%
to us on a daily basis.

00:25:49.390 --> 00:25:51.180 align:middle line:84%
So we could see our
chemicals and how

00:25:51.180 --> 00:25:54.158 align:middle line:84%
they're changing in the body,
and hormones, and so forth.

00:25:54.158 --> 00:25:55.950 align:middle line:84%
What are some of them
that you're aware of?

00:25:55.950 --> 00:25:56.670 align:middle line:84%
>>BARSOTTI: And
this is so great,

00:25:56.670 --> 00:25:59.190 align:middle line:84%
because now where we are
with our microbiome research,

00:25:59.190 --> 00:26:00.990 align:middle line:84%
that we might be
able to actually find

00:26:00.990 --> 00:26:03.600 align:middle line:84%
the proper receptacle
that can actually do this.

00:26:03.600 --> 00:26:07.890 align:middle line:84%
So there's a lot
developing in this area.

00:26:07.890 --> 00:26:12.180 align:middle line:84%
Konstantin and I have sort
of joked in the future

00:26:12.180 --> 00:26:16.470 align:middle line:84%
that there would be a mirror
that we could see ourselves

00:26:16.470 --> 00:26:19.205 align:middle line:84%
before we walk out
the door and say,

00:26:19.205 --> 00:26:20.330 align:middle line:90%
let's just check my energy.

00:26:20.330 --> 00:26:22.050 align:middle line:84%
Let's see how I'm
doing today and be

00:26:22.050 --> 00:26:26.457 align:middle line:84%
able to have that reflection be
more of a healthy mind state.

00:26:26.457 --> 00:26:29.040 align:middle line:10%
And it's like, yeah, that board
meeting that is supposed to be

00:26:29.040 --> 00:26:31.080 align:middle line:10%
today, I better not attend.

00:26:31.080 --> 00:26:32.610 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: And you know what?

I don't think that's far off.

00:26:34.170 --> 00:26:35.490 align:middle line:90%
>>BARSOTTI: I agree.

00:26:35.490 --> 00:26:36.360 align:middle line:90%
I agree.

00:26:36.360 --> 00:26:37.410 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And I
think our ancestors

00:26:37.410 --> 00:26:38.580 align:middle line:90%
knew how to do that anyway.

00:26:38.580 --> 00:26:38.970 align:middle line:90%
>>BARSOTTI: Absolutely.

00:26:38.970 --> 00:26:41.250 align:middle line:84%

00:26:41.250 --> 00:26:41.910 align:middle line:90%
reflected.

00:26:41.910 --> 00:26:42.810 align:middle line:90%
>>BARSOTTI: That's right.

00:26:42.810 --> 00:26:44.520 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: It's exciting
and really exciting

00:26:44.520 --> 00:26:45.320 align:middle line:90%
crossover times.

00:26:45.320 --> 00:26:46.660 align:middle line:90%
And your work is amazing.

00:26:46.660 --> 00:26:49.590 align:middle line:84%
And I think we'll have more to
talk about down the road too.

00:26:49.590 --> 00:26:52.080 align:middle line:84%
We haven't even gotten
into, I think, about half

00:26:52.080 --> 00:26:55.440 align:middle line:84%
of what we were scheduled
to talk about today.

00:26:55.440 --> 00:26:58.245 align:middle line:84%
