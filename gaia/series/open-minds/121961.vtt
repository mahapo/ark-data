00:00:27.677 --> 00:00:29.760 align:middle line:10%
>>REGINA MEREDITH: Throughout
history the question

00:00:29.760 --> 00:00:33.270 align:middle line:10%
has risen about the missing two
decades in the life of Jesus.

00:00:33.270 --> 00:00:35.850 align:middle line:84%
Many have speculated that
he journeyed east to become

00:00:35.850 --> 00:00:38.260 align:middle line:90%
educated by eastern mystics.

00:00:38.260 --> 00:00:39.870 align:middle line:84%
Paul Davids is
here with us today

00:00:39.870 --> 00:00:42.460 align:middle line:84%
to speak about his
film "Jesus in India,"

00:00:42.460 --> 00:00:44.400 align:middle line:84%
which gives a fascinating
glimpse into some

00:00:44.400 --> 00:00:47.850 align:middle line:84%
of the alleged evidence that
Jesus was indeed in India where

00:00:47.850 --> 00:00:49.650 align:middle line:90%
he is still revered today.

00:00:49.650 --> 00:00:52.250 align:middle line:84%
And I think that's one of the
things people would be probably

00:00:52.250 --> 00:00:56.410 align:middle line:84%
most surprised about is to hear
that the being known as Jesus

00:00:56.410 --> 00:00:58.932 align:middle line:84%
is indeed revered in
India, in Kashmir.

00:00:58.932 --> 00:01:00.140 align:middle line:90%
And we're going to get to it.

00:01:00.140 --> 00:01:04.140 align:middle line:84%
There's even a Pakistani beer
that's involved in this story.

00:01:04.140 --> 00:01:06.700 align:middle line:84%
So before we get going,
I'd like to find out first

00:01:06.700 --> 00:01:09.140 align:middle line:84%
why you decided to
take this project on.

00:01:09.140 --> 00:01:12.050 align:middle line:84%
And then give us a little bit
of the story of Ed Martin,

00:01:12.050 --> 00:01:14.240 align:middle line:84%
who we're going to be
seeing featured quite a bit

00:01:14.240 --> 00:01:18.850 align:middle line:84%
here, which is-- he seems like
such an earnest gentleman that

00:01:18.850 --> 00:01:21.120 align:middle line:84%
was really on a soul
searching journey.

00:01:21.120 --> 00:01:22.250 align:middle line:90%
So set us up.

00:01:22.250 --> 00:01:24.770 align:middle line:10%
>>PAUL DAVIDS: Well, that's
all absolutely true about Ed.

00:01:24.770 --> 00:01:27.900 align:middle line:10%
He's one of the most remarkable
people I've ever met.

00:01:27.900 --> 00:01:30.690 align:middle line:10%
And this was one of the
most challenging movies,

00:01:30.690 --> 00:01:32.620 align:middle line:10%
challenging projects
I've ever taken on.

00:01:32.620 --> 00:01:33.420 align:middle line:10%
>>REGINA: How so?

00:01:33.420 --> 00:01:38.500 align:middle line:84%
>>DAVIDS: Because it involved
4,000 miles of travel in India

00:01:38.500 --> 00:01:39.794 align:middle line:90%
under harrowing conditions.

00:01:39.794 --> 00:01:40.960 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: It looked like it.

00:01:40.960 --> 00:01:43.840 align:middle line:84%
>>DAVIDS: Going to
absolutely incredible places,

00:01:43.840 --> 00:01:48.420 align:middle line:84%
ancient temples of the Hindus,
Buddhist temples far up

00:01:48.420 --> 00:01:52.535 align:middle line:84%
in the mountains, meeting
with the Shankaracharya,

00:01:52.535 --> 00:01:55.920 align:middle line:84%
he is essentially
the pope of Hinduism.

00:01:55.920 --> 00:01:57.360 align:middle line:84%
And then traveling
to the Vatican

00:01:57.360 --> 00:02:00.250 align:middle line:84%
to get their point of
view about the question.

00:02:00.250 --> 00:02:06.420 align:middle line:84%
The whole issue of the missing
years, the Bible takes Jesus up

00:02:06.420 --> 00:02:12.760 align:middle line:84%
to about the age 13, giving
learned answers in the temple

00:02:12.760 --> 00:02:16.120 align:middle line:84%
to the contemporary wise
men who are so surprised

00:02:16.120 --> 00:02:17.910 align:middle line:90%
with his wisdom.

00:02:17.910 --> 00:02:21.069 align:middle line:84%
And then we have what in
film we call a jump cut.

00:02:21.069 --> 00:02:22.360 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right, what happened.

00:02:22.360 --> 00:02:24.234 align:middle line:84%
>>DAVIDS: There's 18
years are not mentioned.

00:02:24.234 --> 00:02:28.080 align:middle line:84%
There's one sentence
in Luke that says

00:02:28.080 --> 00:02:34.150 align:middle line:84%
and Jesus grew in wisdom
and in stature and in favor

00:02:34.150 --> 00:02:35.870 align:middle line:90%
with God and man.

00:02:35.870 --> 00:02:38.762 align:middle line:90%
And that covers 18 years of--

00:02:38.762 --> 00:02:39.970 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: That's a catch-all.

00:02:39.970 --> 00:02:42.670 align:middle line:84%
>>DAVIDS: --one of the
most important personages

00:02:42.670 --> 00:02:44.060 align:middle line:90%
of all of history.

00:02:44.060 --> 00:02:49.430 align:middle line:84%
So the question arises why
is all of that left out.

00:02:49.430 --> 00:02:51.770 align:middle line:84%
Because in the Bible
you next see Jesus

00:02:51.770 --> 00:02:56.670 align:middle line:84%
by the River Jordan being
baptized by his cousin John.

00:02:56.670 --> 00:02:59.860 align:middle line:84%
And it says that Jesus got
to be around 30 years of age

00:02:59.860 --> 00:03:01.540 align:middle line:90%
at that point.

00:03:01.540 --> 00:03:04.270 align:middle line:90%
Now how did I come upon this?

00:03:04.270 --> 00:03:09.730 align:middle line:84%
I met Edward T. Martin
at a conference.

00:03:09.730 --> 00:03:13.760 align:middle line:84%
Actually I think it was
2002 when we first met.

00:03:13.760 --> 00:03:17.950 align:middle line:84%
And he had a book called
"King of Travelers,

00:03:17.950 --> 00:03:20.980 align:middle line:90%
Jesus' Lost Years in India."

00:03:20.980 --> 00:03:22.820 align:middle line:84%
I thought it was
very curious and I

00:03:22.820 --> 00:03:26.660 align:middle line:90%
like curious and unusual topics.

00:03:26.660 --> 00:03:30.700 align:middle line:84%
And he pointed out
to me that there

00:03:30.700 --> 00:03:36.810 align:middle line:84%
is a book of Muslims sayings
that is well known by Muslims

00:03:36.810 --> 00:03:38.500 align:middle line:90%
that refers to Jesus.

00:03:38.500 --> 00:03:40.560 align:middle line:90%
They called him Saint Issa.

00:03:40.560 --> 00:03:44.580 align:middle line:84%
It refers to him as
the king of travelers

00:03:44.580 --> 00:03:47.660 align:middle line:84%
or the prince of
travelers, the concept

00:03:47.660 --> 00:03:50.955 align:middle line:84%
being that he traveled more
than any other contemporary

00:03:50.955 --> 00:03:52.550 align:middle line:90%
of his time.

00:03:52.550 --> 00:03:58.750 align:middle line:84%
He wasn't just in
Galilee and Judea.

00:03:58.750 --> 00:04:03.920 align:middle line:84%
But his journey was to reunite
the lost tribes of Israel.

00:04:03.920 --> 00:04:05.820 align:middle line:84%
And they were
scattered, and many

00:04:05.820 --> 00:04:07.370 align:middle line:90%
were scattered to the east.

00:04:07.370 --> 00:04:09.637 align:middle line:84%
And that included India,
a lot of evidence of this.

00:04:09.637 --> 00:04:11.720 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: This is a really
fascinating part, which

00:04:11.720 --> 00:04:13.090 align:middle line:90%
we'll get into further on.

00:04:13.090 --> 00:04:15.320 align:middle line:90%
But I found that fascinating.

00:04:15.320 --> 00:04:17.746 align:middle line:84%
>>DAVIDS: But the
relationship with Ed--

00:04:17.746 --> 00:04:19.579 align:middle line:84%
just I'll fill in a
little more because he's

00:04:19.579 --> 00:04:21.829 align:middle line:84%
so important to the
story, in his book.

00:04:21.829 --> 00:04:23.790 align:middle line:90%
He's a mountain climber.

00:04:23.790 --> 00:04:25.090 align:middle line:90%
He's an adventurer.

00:04:25.090 --> 00:04:26.820 align:middle line:90%
He's from Texas.

00:04:26.820 --> 00:04:28.780 align:middle line:90%
He hunts with a bow and arrow.

00:04:28.780 --> 00:04:30.790 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: He's from
fundamentalist country too.

00:04:30.790 --> 00:04:34.200 align:middle line:84%
>>DAVIDS: He was raised as a
fundamentalist and he liked it.

00:04:34.200 --> 00:04:36.900 align:middle line:84%
His mother took them to
church three times a week,

00:04:36.900 --> 00:04:39.450 align:middle line:84%
and they were serious
about their churching.

00:04:39.450 --> 00:04:40.450 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes they were.

00:04:40.450 --> 00:04:41.150 align:middle line:90%
>>DAVIDS: They liked it.

00:04:41.150 --> 00:04:41.650 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: You see
that in the film.

00:04:41.650 --> 00:04:43.090 align:middle line:90%
>>DAVIDS: They liked it.

00:04:43.090 --> 00:04:47.270 align:middle line:84%
And his problem with
his Church of Christ

00:04:47.270 --> 00:04:50.840 align:middle line:84%
was that he asked
too many questions.

00:04:50.840 --> 00:04:54.900 align:middle line:84%
They would say Ed why are
you worrying about that.

00:04:54.900 --> 00:04:57.120 align:middle line:84%
You worry about
your own salvation.

00:04:57.120 --> 00:04:59.400 align:middle line:84%
That's what Ed needs
to worry about,

00:04:59.400 --> 00:05:01.730 align:middle line:84%
not where Jesus was
during those 18 years.

00:05:01.730 --> 00:05:04.360 align:middle line:90%
What difference does it make?

00:05:04.360 --> 00:05:07.770 align:middle line:84%
Ed explains in the book that he
came upon this theory of Jesus

00:05:07.770 --> 00:05:11.100 align:middle line:84%
in India from a few
different sources.

00:05:11.100 --> 00:05:12.970 align:middle line:90%
One was Edgar Cayce.

00:05:12.970 --> 00:05:14.577 align:middle line:84%
He joined an Edgar
Cayce study group.

00:05:14.577 --> 00:05:15.910 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: That'll get you going.

00:05:15.910 --> 00:05:18.660 align:middle line:84%
>>DAVIDS: He found that this
great sleeping prophet had

00:05:18.660 --> 00:05:20.800 align:middle line:90%
said that Jesus was in India.

00:05:20.800 --> 00:05:24.910 align:middle line:84%
Then number two Ed came
across "The Aquarian Gospel

00:05:24.910 --> 00:05:30.880 align:middle line:84%
of Jesus the Christ" by Reverend
Dowling, a civil war writer.

00:05:30.880 --> 00:05:32.720 align:middle line:90%
This was channeled material.

00:05:32.720 --> 00:05:37.040 align:middle line:84%
Again, it said that Jesus spent
part of his life in India.

00:05:37.040 --> 00:05:40.280 align:middle line:84%
And I believe that
does mention Jagannath

00:05:40.280 --> 00:05:44.780 align:middle line:84%
where there was a famous Hindu
temple that's 2,500 years old.

00:05:44.780 --> 00:05:46.930 align:middle line:84%
That temple would've
been there for 500 years

00:05:46.930 --> 00:05:49.490 align:middle line:90%
by the time Jesus showed up.

00:05:49.490 --> 00:05:52.220 align:middle line:84%
So the idea of
going to Jagannath

00:05:52.220 --> 00:05:53.679 align:middle line:84%
and talking to the
head of Hinduism

00:05:53.679 --> 00:05:55.094 align:middle line:84%
and getting his
side of the story.

00:05:55.094 --> 00:05:55.930 align:middle line:90%
I mean we did this.

00:05:55.930 --> 00:05:57.429 align:middle line:90%
We actually did it.

00:05:57.429 --> 00:05:58.720 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: I know, it's amazing.

00:05:58.720 --> 00:05:59.980 align:middle line:90%
You really went to the lengths.

00:05:59.980 --> 00:06:00.210 align:middle line:84%
>>DAVIDS: We went
to the Dalai Lama.

00:06:00.210 --> 00:06:00.320 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes you did.

00:06:00.320 --> 00:06:01.230 align:middle line:84%
>>DAVIDS: We went
to the Vatican.

00:06:01.230 --> 00:06:01.965 align:middle line:90%
We got to--

00:06:01.965 --> 00:06:02.920 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And we're going
to hear from the Dalai

00:06:02.920 --> 00:06:03.753 align:middle line:90%
Lama in this as well

00:06:03.753 --> 00:06:05.700 align:middle line:90%
>>DAVIDS: It was incredible.

00:06:05.700 --> 00:06:09.850 align:middle line:84%
There was a third source
for Ed, the writings

00:06:09.850 --> 00:06:12.590 align:middle line:90%
of Paramahansa Yogananda.

00:06:12.590 --> 00:06:17.662 align:middle line:84%
Yogananda, the great
yogi who brought I think

00:06:17.662 --> 00:06:18.870 align:middle line:90%
responsible for bringing it--

00:06:18.870 --> 00:06:19.840 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: To the
Western world, sure.

00:06:19.840 --> 00:06:21.470 align:middle line:84%
>>DAVIDS: --yoga to
the Western world

00:06:21.470 --> 00:06:24.060 align:middle line:84%
and founded the
self-realization fellowship,

00:06:24.060 --> 00:06:27.520 align:middle line:90%
which is very important today.

00:06:27.520 --> 00:06:31.030 align:middle line:84%
Yogananda died in
the early 1950s,

00:06:31.030 --> 00:06:35.030 align:middle line:84%
but his writings such as
"Autobiography of a Yogi,"

00:06:35.030 --> 00:06:39.030 align:middle line:84%
are revered today,
very, very widely read.

00:06:39.030 --> 00:06:43.340 align:middle line:84%
And Yogananda claimed that Jesus
was in India for those-- a lot

00:06:43.340 --> 00:06:44.500 align:middle line:90%
of those missing years.

00:06:44.500 --> 00:06:46.080 align:middle line:84%
We're not saying
the whole 18 years,

00:06:46.080 --> 00:06:49.410 align:middle line:84%
but that he took the
Silk Road to the east.

00:06:49.410 --> 00:06:54.840 align:middle line:84%
Now his explanation was that the
three wise men were from India.

00:06:54.840 --> 00:06:55.720 align:middle line:90%
That's been debated.

00:06:55.720 --> 00:06:56.810 align:middle line:90%
Where were they from?

00:06:56.810 --> 00:06:57.260 align:middle line:90%
Who knows.

00:06:57.260 --> 00:06:57.740 align:middle line:90%
Were they Persians.

00:06:57.740 --> 00:06:58.120 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Some say Persia.

00:06:58.120 --> 00:06:58.920 align:middle line:90%
Yeah, exactly.

00:06:58.920 --> 00:07:00.750 align:middle line:90%
>>DAVIDS: Yeah, your Persia.

00:07:00.750 --> 00:07:02.240 align:middle line:90%
Yogananda said no, no, no.

00:07:02.240 --> 00:07:06.420 align:middle line:84%
The gifts were gold,
incense, and myrrh,

00:07:06.420 --> 00:07:11.630 align:middle line:84%
and those were traditional
gifts that Indian holy men would

00:07:11.630 --> 00:07:16.540 align:middle line:90%
bestow upon worthy individuals.

00:07:16.540 --> 00:07:22.180 align:middle line:84%
So he claimed that they had
an influence in Jesus' life

00:07:22.180 --> 00:07:25.380 align:middle line:84%
and he was essentially
repaying the visit.

00:07:25.380 --> 00:07:31.800 align:middle line:84%
And even in the Aquarian gospel
it talks about a Prince Ravanna

00:07:31.800 --> 00:07:34.680 align:middle line:84%
I believe from India who
became a sort of patron.

00:07:34.680 --> 00:07:37.811 align:middle line:90%
Now is any of this true?

00:07:37.811 --> 00:07:39.810 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: The point is
these were the influences

00:07:39.810 --> 00:07:41.740 align:middle line:84%
to start him on this
amazing journey.

00:07:41.740 --> 00:07:42.698 align:middle line:90%
>>DAVIDS: That's right.

00:07:42.698 --> 00:07:48.339 align:middle line:84%
He started and he
badgered his minister.

00:07:48.339 --> 00:07:49.880 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: We're
going to show a clip.

00:07:49.880 --> 00:07:50.840 align:middle line:90%
Do you mind?

00:07:50.840 --> 00:07:51.930 align:middle line:90%
In a moment.

00:07:51.930 --> 00:07:52.971 align:middle line:90%
>>DAVIDS: We can do that.

00:07:52.971 --> 00:07:56.490 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: We need to
show where Ed came from

00:07:56.490 --> 00:07:58.460 align:middle line:90%
and what he was up against.

00:07:58.460 --> 00:08:00.670 align:middle line:84%
He lost a lot of
credibility, a lot

00:08:00.670 --> 00:08:03.320 align:middle line:84%
of street cred in his community
and certainly with the church,

00:08:03.320 --> 00:08:06.250 align:middle line:84%
and among his family and
so forth for pursuing

00:08:06.250 --> 00:08:09.675 align:middle line:84%
this crazy odyssey to again
uncover these missing years.

00:08:09.675 --> 00:08:11.300 align:middle line:84%
>>DAVIDS: Regina, he
comes from a world

00:08:11.300 --> 00:08:16.530 align:middle line:84%
of no drinking, no dancing,
three times a week at church.

00:08:16.530 --> 00:08:20.070 align:middle line:84%
So his persistence
after he heard

00:08:20.070 --> 00:08:22.410 align:middle line:84%
about the possibility
of Jesus in India

00:08:22.410 --> 00:08:24.300 align:middle line:84%
got him blackballed
from a church

00:08:24.300 --> 00:08:27.149 align:middle line:84%
that his family had been
members of for their whole life.

00:08:27.149 --> 00:08:28.190 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: His whole life.

00:08:28.190 --> 00:08:31.450 align:middle line:84%
So let's take a look
at the clip of some

00:08:31.450 --> 00:08:35.480 align:middle line:84%
of his former colleagues in
the church and his minister.

00:08:35.480 --> 00:08:36.340 align:middle line:90%
>>DAVIDS: Yes.

00:08:36.340 --> 00:08:40.230 align:middle line:10%
>>Well, we're I guess you'd say
fundamental as far as scripture

00:08:40.230 --> 00:08:41.030 align:middle line:10%
is concerned.

00:08:41.030 --> 00:08:43.132 align:middle line:10%
>>We believe every
word of it, yes.

00:08:43.132 --> 00:08:45.215 align:middle line:10%
>>It was understood we
were not supposed to dance.

00:08:45.215 --> 00:08:48.173 align:middle line:10%
We weren't supposed to drink.

00:08:48.173 --> 00:08:50.638 align:middle line:90%
Gambling was a no-no.

00:08:50.638 --> 00:08:56.415 align:middle line:84%
I've known Ed Martin for
I guess 50 years since he

00:08:56.415 --> 00:08:57.540 align:middle line:90%
was a little boy certainly.

00:08:57.540 --> 00:09:00.662 align:middle line:84%
I'm not sure how old Ed
is, but I've known him

00:09:00.662 --> 00:09:02.470 align:middle line:90%
I guess all of his life.

00:09:02.470 --> 00:09:04.935 align:middle line:84%
Ed has always been
out there on the edge.

00:09:04.935 --> 00:09:09.372 align:middle line:84%
The difference between being
a visionary and being crazy

00:09:09.372 --> 00:09:11.837 align:middle line:84%
is a very small
difference sometimes.

00:09:11.837 --> 00:09:16.810 align:middle line:84%
And none of us know-- none of
us know what that difference is.

00:09:16.810 --> 00:09:19.230 align:middle line:84%
Ed's grasp of reality and
mine are not the same thing.

00:09:19.230 --> 00:09:23.548 align:middle line:84%
>>He has always wandered
around and he enjoys traveling.

00:09:23.548 --> 00:09:26.760 align:middle line:10%
And he just never
has settled in.

00:09:26.760 --> 00:09:31.184 align:middle line:84%
And that's all right because
that's what he wants to do.

00:09:31.184 --> 00:09:33.510 align:middle line:84%
But that's not what the
rest of us do of course.

00:09:33.510 --> 00:09:35.962 align:middle line:84%
That's different
is what I'm saying.

00:09:35.962 --> 00:09:38.170 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Anyway, I think
we can see that what he did

00:09:38.170 --> 00:09:40.044 align:middle line:84%
was quite a departure
from what he came from.

00:09:40.044 --> 00:09:41.550 align:middle line:84%
And I just had
to-- I just wanted

00:09:41.550 --> 00:09:43.510 align:middle line:84%
to show that because it
took a lot of courage

00:09:43.510 --> 00:09:46.910 align:middle line:90%
for him to go on this odyssey.

00:09:46.910 --> 00:09:49.030 align:middle line:84%
>>DAVIDS: He risked
everything to pursue the--

00:09:49.030 --> 00:09:50.321 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: He risked everything.

00:09:50.321 --> 00:09:54.840 align:middle line:84%
>>DAVIDS: Now when he
was young he decided

00:09:54.840 --> 00:09:56.610 align:middle line:90%
to join the Peace Corps.

00:09:56.610 --> 00:10:01.170 align:middle line:84%
It was the early 1970s and
they sent him to Afghanistan.

00:10:01.170 --> 00:10:03.210 align:middle line:90%
He wanted to go to India.

00:10:03.210 --> 00:10:05.270 align:middle line:84%
But he felt that being
in Afghanistan at least

00:10:05.270 --> 00:10:07.660 align:middle line:90%
he would be close to India.

00:10:07.660 --> 00:10:09.630 align:middle line:84%
And so he accepted
that assignment

00:10:09.630 --> 00:10:12.190 align:middle line:84%
to teach English as
a second language.

00:10:12.190 --> 00:10:16.690 align:middle line:84%
And before he
departed his mother

00:10:16.690 --> 00:10:21.040 align:middle line:84%
ran into an old high school
friend who-- they hadn't

00:10:21.040 --> 00:10:22.240 align:middle line:90%
seen each other in years.

00:10:22.240 --> 00:10:25.160 align:middle line:84%
This man had become
a diplomat in India.

00:10:25.160 --> 00:10:29.230 align:middle line:84%
And when she told him
of her son's ambition

00:10:29.230 --> 00:10:31.610 align:middle line:90%
he said I've got to talk to him.

00:10:31.610 --> 00:10:35.460 align:middle line:84%
And the conversation between
this man and Ed was pivotal.

00:10:35.460 --> 00:10:36.802 align:middle line:90%
It was as though it was fated.

00:10:36.802 --> 00:10:38.260 align:middle line:84%
It was one of those
things that had

00:10:38.260 --> 00:10:41.980 align:middle line:84%
to happen because this diplomat
said if you go to India

00:10:41.980 --> 00:10:44.450 align:middle line:90%
you must go to Kashmir.

00:10:44.450 --> 00:10:46.790 align:middle line:84%
And it was Ed's decision
to go to Kashmir

00:10:46.790 --> 00:10:51.130 align:middle line:84%
that opened up for
him an immense part

00:10:51.130 --> 00:10:54.970 align:middle line:84%
of the hidden story
about Jesus in India.

00:10:54.970 --> 00:10:57.690 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: In an area which
since has had so much conflict.

00:10:57.690 --> 00:10:59.810 align:middle line:84%
And we're going to
show a bit of film

00:10:59.810 --> 00:11:02.390 align:middle line:84%
at the end about what
he was up against trying

00:11:02.390 --> 00:11:03.792 align:middle line:90%
to get to the crypt.

00:11:03.792 --> 00:11:05.250 align:middle line:84%
>>DAVIDS: Regina,
when we decided--

00:11:05.250 --> 00:11:06.130 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: You were scared.

00:11:06.130 --> 00:11:06.725 align:middle line:90%
I mean you had--

00:11:06.725 --> 00:11:07.210 align:middle line:90%
>>DAVIDS: Yes.

00:11:07.210 --> 00:11:09.740 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: --really terrorist
activities following you.

00:11:09.740 --> 00:11:12.510 align:middle line:84%
>>DAVIDS: He was there
in his younger years

00:11:12.510 --> 00:11:14.850 align:middle line:90%
during his Afghanistan days.

00:11:14.850 --> 00:11:18.420 align:middle line:84%
But when we were there
with the film crew,

00:11:18.420 --> 00:11:20.180 align:middle line:84%
and I'll say that when
the movie actually

00:11:20.180 --> 00:11:25.847 align:middle line:84%
happened we had a film crew that
was mainly Hindus from India.

00:11:25.847 --> 00:11:28.180 align:middle line:84%
I think there was one Muslim
who helped us, particularly

00:11:28.180 --> 00:11:30.420 align:middle line:84%
in Kashmir, because
Kashmir is divided

00:11:30.420 --> 00:11:33.250 align:middle line:84%
between the Muslims
and the Hindus.

00:11:33.250 --> 00:11:37.050 align:middle line:84%
And there's sort of a
silent war always going on.

00:11:37.050 --> 00:11:40.080 align:middle line:84%
There's soldiers on
every block with rifles.

00:11:40.080 --> 00:11:42.780 align:middle line:84%
And here we work,
two Americans landing

00:11:42.780 --> 00:11:45.850 align:middle line:84%
into that situation at
a time when the State

00:11:45.850 --> 00:11:47.429 align:middle line:90%
Department advised against it.

00:11:47.429 --> 00:11:48.470 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah, don't go.

00:11:48.470 --> 00:11:51.029 align:middle line:84%
>>DAVIDS: It wasn't
forbidden, but we

00:11:51.029 --> 00:11:52.070 align:middle line:90%
should have known better.

00:11:52.070 --> 00:11:52.903 align:middle line:90%
It was sort of the--

00:11:52.903 --> 00:11:55.340 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Well, as you say
in the documentary it seemed

00:11:55.340 --> 00:11:57.420 align:middle line:84%
like you were able to
get through each step

00:11:57.420 --> 00:12:00.320 align:middle line:84%
you needed, but within 24
hours some kind of terror

00:12:00.320 --> 00:12:02.440 align:middle line:84%
was following on your
heels in that exact place

00:12:02.440 --> 00:12:03.620 align:middle line:90%
you'd been the day before.

00:12:03.620 --> 00:12:05.940 align:middle line:84%
So it took a lot of courage
for you guys to do this.

00:12:05.940 --> 00:12:07.579 align:middle line:84%
>>DAVIDS: Regina,
we did feel as if we

00:12:07.579 --> 00:12:08.870 align:middle line:90%
were protected on this journey.

00:12:08.870 --> 00:12:09.890 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Exactly.

00:12:09.890 --> 00:12:11.700 align:middle line:84%
>>DAVIDS: And to give
you some examples,

00:12:11.700 --> 00:12:19.280 align:middle line:84%
we were going to go to
a famous Krishna temple.

00:12:19.280 --> 00:12:21.820 align:middle line:84%
I forget if it was in the
place of Krishna's birth.

00:12:21.820 --> 00:12:25.790 align:middle line:84%
But we canceled that
part of the trip.

00:12:25.790 --> 00:12:29.240 align:middle line:84%
And there was a terrorist
attack there at that Temple.

00:12:29.240 --> 00:12:31.690 align:middle line:90%
We would have been there.

00:12:31.690 --> 00:12:37.610 align:middle line:84%
And in Kashmir, the
area that we were at,

00:12:37.610 --> 00:12:41.370 align:middle line:84%
there were a number
of people murdered,

00:12:41.370 --> 00:12:44.866 align:middle line:84%
killed within days
of our departure.

00:12:44.866 --> 00:12:46.240 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: The
force was with you.

00:12:46.240 --> 00:12:47.573 align:middle line:90%
>>DAVIDS: The force was with us.

00:12:47.573 --> 00:12:48.944 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:12:48.944 --> 00:12:51.360 align:middle line:84%
>>DAVIDS: We asked for the
blessing of Yogananda before we

00:12:51.360 --> 00:12:51.640 align:middle line:90%
went and--

00:12:51.640 --> 00:12:53.320 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So this
was your own odyssey.

00:12:53.320 --> 00:12:55.380 align:middle line:84%
Now going back to
the life of Jesus

00:12:55.380 --> 00:12:57.120 align:middle line:84%
and what has been
speculated and what

00:12:57.120 --> 00:13:01.140 align:middle line:84%
looks like it may very well
have some historical roots

00:13:01.140 --> 00:13:03.289 align:middle line:84%
that are valid-- that
you have validated.

00:13:03.289 --> 00:13:05.080 align:middle line:84%
I mean to the extent
you could, considering

00:13:05.080 --> 00:13:07.520 align:middle line:84%
you're getting a lot of
resistance out of this.

00:13:07.520 --> 00:13:09.760 align:middle line:90%
You're talking about a young--

00:13:09.760 --> 00:13:12.400 align:middle line:84%
>>DAVIDS: We call it a
2,000 year old cold case.

00:13:12.400 --> 00:13:13.570 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah, cold case.

00:13:13.570 --> 00:13:15.280 align:middle line:84%
And so in this cold
case you're talking

00:13:15.280 --> 00:13:18.670 align:middle line:84%
about a young man who
by the age of 12, 13

00:13:18.670 --> 00:13:21.930 align:middle line:84%
his elders were listening to
with reverence, because he was

00:13:21.930 --> 00:13:29.300 align:middle line:84%
speaking such incredibly-- not
just esoteric but sophisticated

00:13:29.300 --> 00:13:32.850 align:middle line:84%
wisdoms beyond his
peers, beyond the sages

00:13:32.850 --> 00:13:34.160 align:middle line:90%
and rabbis of the day.

00:13:34.160 --> 00:13:36.060 align:middle line:90%
So he was a respected young man.

00:13:36.060 --> 00:13:38.570 align:middle line:84%
So of course we already know
he's imbued with something.

00:13:38.570 --> 00:13:41.710 align:middle line:84%
And now it's thought that
he may have taken off

00:13:41.710 --> 00:13:44.675 align:middle line:84%
with a caravan along
the Silk Route.

00:13:44.675 --> 00:13:47.175 align:middle line:84%
>>DAVIDS: Well, that was the
way to get to the east in those

00:13:47.175 --> 00:13:48.520 align:middle line:90%
days.

00:13:48.520 --> 00:13:51.700 align:middle line:84%
I mean Jerusalem was
a cosmopolitan city.

00:13:51.700 --> 00:13:53.200 align:middle line:84%
There were people
from China there.

00:13:53.200 --> 00:13:53.710 align:middle line:90%
There were people from India.

00:13:53.710 --> 00:13:55.710 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: All kinds of a
trading going on, yeah.

00:13:55.710 --> 00:13:56.986 align:middle line:90%
>>DAVIDS: Traders, traders.

00:13:56.986 --> 00:14:01.450 align:middle line:84%
Now in the Jewish tradition
of course he reaches 13.

00:14:01.450 --> 00:14:03.140 align:middle line:84%
He would have been
bar mitzvahed,

00:14:03.140 --> 00:14:07.150 align:middle line:84%
which means you're a man
now and you get married.

00:14:07.150 --> 00:14:10.440 align:middle line:84%
That's the next thing that
happens in those days.

00:14:10.440 --> 00:14:12.620 align:middle line:90%
You're an eligible bachelor.

00:14:12.620 --> 00:14:15.280 align:middle line:84%
They're going to
find a mate for you.

00:14:15.280 --> 00:14:18.390 align:middle line:90%
Well, he didn't marry.

00:14:18.390 --> 00:14:20.700 align:middle line:84%
And that kind of
lends credibility

00:14:20.700 --> 00:14:24.150 align:middle line:84%
to the idea that he
didn't remain there

00:14:24.150 --> 00:14:30.990 align:middle line:84%
but joined a caravan and
departed for the east.

00:14:30.990 --> 00:14:32.880 align:middle line:90%
That's the theory.

00:14:32.880 --> 00:14:36.490 align:middle line:84%
And then the question
is, after 2,000 years,

00:14:36.490 --> 00:14:38.770 align:middle line:84%
and with a little help from
Elizabeth Clare Prophet

00:14:38.770 --> 00:14:42.080 align:middle line:84%
and in her book, "The Lost
Years of"-- and a little help

00:14:42.080 --> 00:14:44.905 align:middle line:84%
from German writer
Holger Kersten,

00:14:44.905 --> 00:14:50.780 align:middle line:84%
"Jesus Lived in
India," can we find

00:14:50.780 --> 00:14:54.130 align:middle line:84%
some pretty convincing evidence
that it really happened.

00:14:54.130 --> 00:14:59.610 align:middle line:84%
And I think that there's a
lot that favors that that we

00:14:59.610 --> 00:15:01.960 align:middle line:90%
can really put on the table.

00:15:01.960 --> 00:15:04.150 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Let's talk
about the Pakistani beer.

00:15:04.150 --> 00:15:05.940 align:middle line:84%
Now we're going to
start with the lowest

00:15:05.940 --> 00:15:09.740 align:middle line:84%
element of culture, which
is having one at happy hour.

00:15:09.740 --> 00:15:11.310 align:middle line:84%
But the name of this
particular beer,

00:15:11.310 --> 00:15:15.670 align:middle line:84%
just to show how deep
a part of the native

00:15:15.670 --> 00:15:20.210 align:middle line:84%
culture the presence
of Issa was.

00:15:20.210 --> 00:15:24.930 align:middle line:84%
>>DAVIDS: Well yes, I mean but
this beer was called Murree.

00:15:24.930 --> 00:15:25.940 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: I understand.

00:15:25.940 --> 00:15:27.356 align:middle line:84%
>>DAVIDS: It's a
town in Pakistan.

00:15:27.356 --> 00:15:33.290 align:middle line:84%
It's spelled M-U-R-R-E-E. And
when Ed was in the Peace Corps

00:15:33.290 --> 00:15:37.470 align:middle line:84%
in Afghanistan you
couldn't find liquor there.

00:15:37.470 --> 00:15:38.460 align:middle line:90%
It's a Muslim area.

00:15:38.460 --> 00:15:43.380 align:middle line:84%
But there was a certain American
section where it was allowed

00:15:43.380 --> 00:15:45.030 align:middle line:90%
and you could get a beer.

00:15:45.030 --> 00:15:47.210 align:middle line:84%
And he said he met a
man named Mr. Wilson who

00:15:47.210 --> 00:15:50.510 align:middle line:84%
was the bartender and
he saw this Murree beer.

00:15:50.510 --> 00:15:52.970 align:middle line:84%
And he said, well
that's an English name.

00:15:52.970 --> 00:15:54.360 align:middle line:90%
What's that doing?

00:15:54.360 --> 00:16:00.255 align:middle line:84%
And Mr. Wilson said,
well that's Murree.

00:16:00.255 --> 00:16:01.230 align:middle line:90%
That's Mary.

00:16:01.230 --> 00:16:05.640 align:middle line:84%
That's mother of Jesus, Sahib,
most assuredly mother of Jesus.

00:16:05.640 --> 00:16:06.900 align:middle line:90%
The town named after her.

00:16:06.900 --> 00:16:08.624 align:middle line:90%
She is buried there in Pakistan.

00:16:08.624 --> 00:16:10.290 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: This will
make a lot of people

00:16:10.290 --> 00:16:13.915 align:middle line:84%
upset that think that she
might be up north in England.

00:16:13.915 --> 00:16:15.300 align:middle line:90%
No, no in England.

00:16:15.300 --> 00:16:16.270 align:middle line:84%
>>DAVIDS: Oh, some
say England and some

00:16:16.270 --> 00:16:16.970 align:middle line:90%
say she ascended bodily.

00:16:16.970 --> 00:16:18.920 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Yeah,
Glastonbury and all, yeah.

00:16:18.920 --> 00:16:20.890 align:middle line:84%
>>DAVIDS: Well, the
point is he hears a story

00:16:20.890 --> 00:16:22.630 align:middle line:90%
about a tomb in Pakistan.

00:16:22.630 --> 00:16:26.170 align:middle line:84%
Now Suzanne Olsson is a
writer who has investigated

00:16:26.170 --> 00:16:27.570 align:middle line:90%
this very thoroughly.

00:16:27.570 --> 00:16:31.090 align:middle line:84%
She's written books about
it, the tomb of Mary

00:16:31.090 --> 00:16:33.320 align:middle line:90%
in Murree, Pakistan.

00:16:33.320 --> 00:16:36.920 align:middle line:84%
Why would they
possibly believe this?

00:16:36.920 --> 00:16:39.692 align:middle line:84%
This has to do with the second
part of the story really,

00:16:39.692 --> 00:16:41.525 align:middle line:84%
so we're really jumping
ahead here because--

00:16:41.525 --> 00:16:42.910 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: OK, let's
not jump ahead.

00:16:42.910 --> 00:16:45.201 align:middle line:84%
I just want to say we've got
a beer here that validates

00:16:45.201 --> 00:16:46.150 align:middle line:90%
Jesus was in India OK.

00:16:46.150 --> 00:16:46.800 align:middle line:90%
>>DAVIDS: We've got Mary.

00:16:46.800 --> 00:16:47.430 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Because
his mother was there

00:16:47.430 --> 00:16:48.350 align:middle line:90%
and his mother went with him.

00:16:48.350 --> 00:16:49.370 align:middle line:90%
OK fine.

00:16:49.370 --> 00:16:52.280 align:middle line:84%
So now we can there--
I know one area

00:16:52.280 --> 00:16:55.570 align:middle line:84%
that you think for you in
this story is really profound.

00:16:55.570 --> 00:16:57.210 align:middle line:90%
We can jump right to that.

00:16:57.210 --> 00:17:00.290 align:middle line:84%
And that has to do with a
book by Nicolas Notovitch.

00:17:00.290 --> 00:17:02.560 align:middle line:84%
>>DAVIDS: Yes,
Nicolas Notovitch.

00:17:02.560 --> 00:17:10.950 align:middle line:84%
We're back now in 1890-- wait,
let me see, I think 1887.

00:17:10.950 --> 00:17:14.520 align:middle line:90%
He was on an expedition.

00:17:14.520 --> 00:17:15.510 align:middle line:90%
He was Jewish.

00:17:15.510 --> 00:17:16.310 align:middle line:90%
He converted--

00:17:16.310 --> 00:17:17.110 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Russian.

00:17:17.110 --> 00:17:18.790 align:middle line:90%
>>DAVIDS: --to Catholicism.

00:17:18.790 --> 00:17:22.650 align:middle line:84%
And he's on an
expedition that takes him

00:17:22.650 --> 00:17:27.470 align:middle line:84%
to Hemis Monastery
in Ladakh, India.

00:17:27.470 --> 00:17:31.480 align:middle line:84%
This is around 14,000 feet
elevation, very rarefied.

00:17:31.480 --> 00:17:35.000 align:middle line:84%
It's a part of the world
that very few people

00:17:35.000 --> 00:17:36.690 align:middle line:90%
would get there.

00:17:36.690 --> 00:17:41.500 align:middle line:84%
And Notovitch had an
accident, fell off a horse,

00:17:41.500 --> 00:17:44.080 align:middle line:84%
broke his leg, and he had to
spend many, many weeks there

00:17:44.080 --> 00:17:45.890 align:middle line:90%
at the monastery.

00:17:45.890 --> 00:17:49.670 align:middle line:84%
And during that time the
monks confided in him

00:17:49.670 --> 00:17:52.850 align:middle line:84%
that they had an
ancient manuscript there

00:17:52.850 --> 00:17:56.380 align:middle line:84%
that told of the life of
Jesus that told of his travels

00:17:56.380 --> 00:17:58.130 align:middle line:90%
in India.

00:17:58.130 --> 00:18:00.800 align:middle line:84%
And he was shown
this manuscript.

00:18:00.800 --> 00:18:02.470 align:middle line:84%
Now these manuscripts
themselves,

00:18:02.470 --> 00:18:04.700 align:middle line:90%
they look very, very unusual.

00:18:04.700 --> 00:18:06.900 align:middle line:90%
I mean it's one page at a time.

00:18:06.900 --> 00:18:08.920 align:middle line:90%
It's like it's on leather.

00:18:08.920 --> 00:18:09.720 align:middle line:90%
I don't know.

00:18:09.720 --> 00:18:10.020 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: It was long.

00:18:10.020 --> 00:18:11.860 align:middle line:84%
>>DAVIDS: Yeah, there
are these long pieces

00:18:11.860 --> 00:18:13.930 align:middle line:90%
one after the other.

00:18:13.930 --> 00:18:17.530 align:middle line:84%
But this book was called
"The Life of Saint Issa,

00:18:17.530 --> 00:18:19.970 align:middle line:90%
The Best of the Sons of Men."

00:18:19.970 --> 00:18:26.964 align:middle line:84%
And Notovitch had help in
translating it from Tibetan.

00:18:26.964 --> 00:18:28.130 align:middle line:90%
This was written in Tibetan.

00:18:28.130 --> 00:18:31.310 align:middle line:84%
But he was told
that the original

00:18:31.310 --> 00:18:35.200 align:middle line:84%
was in Tibet in the poly
language, an older language.

00:18:35.200 --> 00:18:37.700 align:middle line:84%
And the claim was that
this went back to the time

00:18:37.700 --> 00:18:40.410 align:middle line:90%
just after the crucifixion.

00:18:40.410 --> 00:18:43.960 align:middle line:84%
And it told-- it begins
with the crucifixion,

00:18:43.960 --> 00:18:51.660 align:middle line:84%
and presumably written by
traders from the east at that

00:18:51.660 --> 00:18:53.450 align:middle line:84%
time who heard of
the crucifixion

00:18:53.450 --> 00:18:58.790 align:middle line:84%
and then tell the story of Saint
Issa and his travels in India,

00:18:58.790 --> 00:19:02.880 align:middle line:84%
starting from the time
that he was around 13.

00:19:02.880 --> 00:19:05.590 align:middle line:84%
And those travels
they said took him

00:19:05.590 --> 00:19:09.370 align:middle line:84%
to Jagannath, that ancient
temple that would've

00:19:09.370 --> 00:19:10.780 align:middle line:90%
been about 500 years old.

00:19:10.780 --> 00:19:13.660 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Which is where some
of the top sages in the east

00:19:13.660 --> 00:19:14.700 align:middle line:90%
would have resided.

00:19:14.700 --> 00:19:16.290 align:middle line:90%
>>DAVIDS: Would have resided.

00:19:16.290 --> 00:19:18.110 align:middle line:84%
So the claim was
there in this story

00:19:18.110 --> 00:19:20.120 align:middle line:84%
that Jesus was in
Jagannath, like was

00:19:20.120 --> 00:19:25.020 align:middle line:84%
said in the Aquarian
gospel, which was supposedly

00:19:25.020 --> 00:19:27.703 align:middle line:84%
channeled information
from the Akashic records.

00:19:27.703 --> 00:19:28.510 align:middle line:90%
Who knows?

00:19:28.510 --> 00:19:29.280 align:middle line:90%
It's interesting.

00:19:29.280 --> 00:19:30.955 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: In that sense
it's all channeled.

00:19:30.955 --> 00:19:31.450 align:middle line:90%
>>DAVIDS: In that sense.

00:19:31.450 --> 00:19:32.440 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Every
book is channeled,

00:19:32.440 --> 00:19:34.231 align:middle line:84%
every divine work is
channeled pretty much.

00:19:34.231 --> 00:19:36.570 align:middle line:84%
>>DAVIDS: But
here's Notovitch who

00:19:36.570 --> 00:19:40.020 align:middle line:84%
is able to translate this story
and he wants to publish it.

00:19:40.020 --> 00:19:43.640 align:middle line:90%
And he goes to Rome.

00:19:43.640 --> 00:19:47.080 align:middle line:84%
He speaks to an archbishop
of the Catholic Church

00:19:47.080 --> 00:19:51.660 align:middle line:84%
who he refuses to name who
discourages him and says, oh

00:19:51.660 --> 00:19:52.910 align:middle line:90%
why would you want to do that.

00:19:52.910 --> 00:19:54.535 align:middle line:84%
Nobody's going to
believe it and you're

00:19:54.535 --> 00:19:57.030 align:middle line:90%
going to have so many enemies.

00:19:57.030 --> 00:19:58.830 align:middle line:90%
But he did publish it.

00:19:58.830 --> 00:20:01.900 align:middle line:84%
He also claimed that the
archbishop confided in him

00:20:01.900 --> 00:20:04.220 align:middle line:84%
that the Vatican knew
all about Jesus in India,

00:20:04.220 --> 00:20:07.280 align:middle line:84%
that they had many documents
related to Jesus' travels

00:20:07.280 --> 00:20:08.110 align:middle line:90%
in India.

00:20:08.110 --> 00:20:10.400 align:middle line:84%
It's not part of
the official canon.

00:20:10.400 --> 00:20:16.600 align:middle line:84%
This, like many of the books
that were considered heretical

00:20:16.600 --> 00:20:18.850 align:middle line:84%
and erased from the
record when they decided

00:20:18.850 --> 00:20:21.550 align:middle line:84%
what were going to be the
books of the New Testament

00:20:21.550 --> 00:20:24.129 align:middle line:84%
and the letters, and the
epistles, and that's it.

00:20:24.129 --> 00:20:25.420 align:middle line:90%
Everything else was eliminated.

00:20:25.420 --> 00:20:26.340 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Book of Thomas
eliminated, others.

00:20:26.340 --> 00:20:27.173 align:middle line:90%
>>DAVIDS: Destroyed.

00:20:27.173 --> 00:20:30.380 align:middle line:84%
Well, it was buried in
the desert in Egypt.

00:20:30.380 --> 00:20:35.810 align:middle line:84%
So Notovitch publishes the book
under the name "The Secret Life

00:20:35.810 --> 00:20:37.950 align:middle line:90%
of Jesus Christ."

00:20:37.950 --> 00:20:43.330 align:middle line:84%
And it causes a furor,
a sensation and a furor.

00:20:43.330 --> 00:20:47.270 align:middle line:84%
I think it was in
19-- no, it was 1894

00:20:47.270 --> 00:20:48.500 align:middle line:90%
when that book was published.

00:20:48.500 --> 00:20:52.130 align:middle line:84%
So this is what really brought
the Jesus in India concept

00:20:52.130 --> 00:20:54.472 align:middle line:90%
to the forefront.

00:20:54.472 --> 00:20:56.680 align:middle line:84%
But it got the attention of
so many important people.

00:20:56.680 --> 00:21:04.590 align:middle line:84%
For example Nehru, the first
prime minister of India

00:21:04.590 --> 00:21:07.465 align:middle line:84%
indicated that the belief
was very, very strong

00:21:07.465 --> 00:21:12.070 align:middle line:84%
that Jesus had been in
northern India and Kashmir,

00:21:12.070 --> 00:21:14.000 align:middle line:90%
Ladakh, that region.

00:21:14.000 --> 00:21:18.050 align:middle line:84%
So that gave it
further credibility.

00:21:18.050 --> 00:21:21.890 align:middle line:84%
In any event, there was
a skeptic or debunker

00:21:21.890 --> 00:21:25.980 align:middle line:84%
at that time, Max Muller,
who was a scholar.

00:21:25.980 --> 00:21:29.640 align:middle line:84%
I believe he was from England,
who attacked Notovitch

00:21:29.640 --> 00:21:32.890 align:middle line:84%
so bitterly, claiming he
made the whole thing up.

00:21:32.890 --> 00:21:34.580 align:middle line:90%
It was all a forgery.

00:21:34.580 --> 00:21:38.750 align:middle line:84%
So many Christians have
relied upon the debunking

00:21:38.750 --> 00:21:42.050 align:middle line:84%
of Max Muller to dismiss
this without knowing

00:21:42.050 --> 00:21:43.660 align:middle line:90%
the rest of the story.

00:21:43.660 --> 00:21:46.850 align:middle line:84%
The rest of the story is
fascinating, it's fabulous.

00:21:46.850 --> 00:21:49.860 align:middle line:84%
It's what gives it the
meat and credibility.

00:21:49.860 --> 00:21:51.530 align:middle line:84%
And it explained a
lot of our journey

00:21:51.530 --> 00:21:55.450 align:middle line:84%
in India, because for
us this was a quest.

00:21:55.450 --> 00:21:57.790 align:middle line:84%
If we could actually see
this document and proved

00:21:57.790 --> 00:21:59.490 align:middle line:90%
it still existed.

00:21:59.490 --> 00:22:04.160 align:middle line:84%
If we could even prove
the chain of those

00:22:04.160 --> 00:22:08.410 align:middle line:84%
who saw it subsequently
that that had validity,

00:22:08.410 --> 00:22:10.920 align:middle line:84%
what a contribution
we would be making.

00:22:10.920 --> 00:22:14.620 align:middle line:84%
And this is really what we were
able to do in this 4,000 mile

00:22:14.620 --> 00:22:17.140 align:middle line:84%
quest, not to actually
see the document.

00:22:17.140 --> 00:22:22.390 align:middle line:84%
We didn't succeed in that,
although we got to Hemis.

00:22:22.390 --> 00:22:27.100 align:middle line:84%
We have an interview with one
of the top monks from Hemis.

00:22:27.100 --> 00:22:31.340 align:middle line:84%
So we have an inside story
that hasn't been heard before.

00:22:31.340 --> 00:22:33.730 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA MEREDITH: So
let's-- yes, go ahead.

00:22:33.730 --> 00:22:35.124 align:middle line:90%
>>DAVIDS: So here's the chain.

00:22:35.124 --> 00:22:36.290 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes, that's right.

00:22:36.290 --> 00:22:39.910 align:middle line:84%
>>DAVIDS: From Notovitch
we go to Swami Abhedananda.

00:22:39.910 --> 00:22:41.850 align:middle line:90%
He lived in Calcutta.

00:22:41.850 --> 00:22:42.970 align:middle line:90%
He was a scholar.

00:22:42.970 --> 00:22:45.510 align:middle line:84%
He's written many
books, wonderful books.

00:22:45.510 --> 00:22:49.220 align:middle line:84%
They have a tremendous
psychology to them.

00:22:49.220 --> 00:22:52.590 align:middle line:84%
He's an expert in
Vedanta philosophy.

00:22:52.590 --> 00:22:55.690 align:middle line:84%
And there's still
a hermitage there

00:22:55.690 --> 00:22:59.480 align:middle line:84%
in his name with monks that
have kept his quarters where

00:22:59.480 --> 00:23:02.330 align:middle line:90%
he lived exactly as they were.

00:23:02.330 --> 00:23:05.574 align:middle line:84%
Thomas Edison visited
there in India.

00:23:05.574 --> 00:23:07.740 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Yes, you have a
piece in the film on this.

00:23:07.740 --> 00:23:10.744 align:middle line:84%
>>DAVIDS: Yes, he gifted Swami
Abhedananda his own gramophone.

00:23:10.744 --> 00:23:12.160 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: I was
thinking we should

00:23:12.160 --> 00:23:13.560 align:middle line:90%
take a little peek at that.

00:23:13.560 --> 00:23:13.815 align:middle line:90%
Shall we?

00:23:13.815 --> 00:23:14.260 align:middle line:90%
>>DAVIDS: Let's see it.

00:23:14.260 --> 00:23:15.864 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Let's take a look.

00:23:15.864 --> 00:23:20.157 align:middle line:10%
>>And Swami Abhedananda lives
for about 20 years in America

00:23:20.157 --> 00:23:25.510 align:middle line:10%
and during that time-- 25
years, 25 years in America.

00:23:25.510 --> 00:23:30.420 align:middle line:10%
And then Swami Abhedananda
made a journey to Hemis Gompa

00:23:30.420 --> 00:23:56.620 align:middle line:10%
and found, he
was-- Thomas Edison

00:23:56.620 --> 00:23:59.800 align:middle line:10%
gave this to Swami Abhedananda.

00:23:59.800 --> 00:24:11.840 align:middle line:90%


00:24:11.840 --> 00:24:13.250 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: So that's fascinating.

00:24:13.250 --> 00:24:17.410 align:middle line:84%
So you wonder, OK what's
Thomas Edison doing there.

00:24:17.410 --> 00:24:19.510 align:middle line:84%
>>DAVIDS: He was interested
in Indian philosophy.

00:24:19.510 --> 00:24:23.420 align:middle line:84%
And Abhedananda had
a superb reputation

00:24:23.420 --> 00:24:27.150 align:middle line:84%
and he wanted to know if there
was truth to the Notovitch

00:24:27.150 --> 00:24:27.950 align:middle line:90%
document.

00:24:27.950 --> 00:24:29.340 align:middle line:90%
So he went to Hemis.

00:24:29.340 --> 00:24:31.180 align:middle line:90%
He was shown the document.

00:24:31.180 --> 00:24:37.990 align:middle line:84%
He translated it again, so I
think into Sanskrit this time,

00:24:37.990 --> 00:24:40.870 align:middle line:84%
so confirmation that
it really exists.

00:24:40.870 --> 00:24:46.200 align:middle line:90%
And that was in I believe 1922.

00:24:46.200 --> 00:24:50.130 align:middle line:84%
Following that up,
just a few years later

00:24:50.130 --> 00:24:55.575 align:middle line:84%
a great Russian explorer, an
artist, very respected man,

00:24:55.575 --> 00:24:59.810 align:middle line:84%
a remarkable man named Nicholas
Roerich leads an expedition

00:24:59.810 --> 00:25:04.300 align:middle line:84%
to that part of the world
and he gets to Hemis.

00:25:04.300 --> 00:25:07.280 align:middle line:84%
And he not only
confirms the document,

00:25:07.280 --> 00:25:09.710 align:middle line:84%
but he sends stories
back that get

00:25:09.710 --> 00:25:15.090 align:middle line:84%
to the top newspapers in New
York at that time, and in Italy

00:25:15.090 --> 00:25:17.810 align:middle line:84%
where it comes to the
attention of the Vatican.

00:25:17.810 --> 00:25:21.140 align:middle line:84%
And these newspaper
headlines there in our movie

00:25:21.140 --> 00:25:23.710 align:middle line:84%
and they're a remarkable
piece of history,

00:25:23.710 --> 00:25:26.620 align:middle line:84%
where the Western
world is being told

00:25:26.620 --> 00:25:32.620 align:middle line:84%
we've got a manuscript, ancient,
says that Jesus was in India.

00:25:32.620 --> 00:25:35.600 align:middle line:84%
Well, the Vatican
responded with skepticism.

00:25:35.600 --> 00:25:37.242 align:middle line:84%
Although it was very
interesting that--

00:25:37.242 --> 00:25:39.450 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Well, the Vatican
responded with skepticism

00:25:39.450 --> 00:25:41.040 align:middle line:90%
when you guys went to them too.

00:25:41.040 --> 00:25:42.170 align:middle line:90%
>>DAVIDS: Sure, of course.

00:25:42.170 --> 00:25:43.220 align:middle line:90%
It's their job.

00:25:43.220 --> 00:25:43.880 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: It's their job.

00:25:43.880 --> 00:25:44.990 align:middle line:90%
>>DAVIDS: It's their job.

00:25:44.990 --> 00:25:50.970 align:middle line:84%
But they did make a
point in connection

00:25:50.970 --> 00:25:54.740 align:middle line:84%
with their skeptical
response that they were not

00:25:54.740 --> 00:25:57.000 align:middle line:84%
questioning the
integrity of Nicholas

00:25:57.000 --> 00:25:59.742 align:middle line:90%
Roerich or his sincerity.

00:25:59.742 --> 00:26:00.950 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: That's good enough.

00:26:00.950 --> 00:26:03.160 align:middle line:84%
>>DAVIDS: But the
question is, if we

00:26:03.160 --> 00:26:06.580 align:middle line:84%
had our hands on this document,
science could study it and tell

00:26:06.580 --> 00:26:07.770 align:middle line:90%
us how old it is.

00:26:07.770 --> 00:26:10.880 align:middle line:84%
Now in the Hemis
monastery they said

00:26:10.880 --> 00:26:15.370 align:middle line:84%
this was a copy of the
original from Tibet.

00:26:15.370 --> 00:26:17.170 align:middle line:84%
You'd need the
original wouldn't you?

00:26:17.170 --> 00:26:22.920 align:middle line:84%
Because as the point is made by
Monsignor Corrado Balducci who

00:26:22.920 --> 00:26:29.870 align:middle line:84%
we saw at the Vatican, and
he was apostolic nuncio

00:26:29.870 --> 00:26:31.550 align:middle line:90%
of John Paul II.

00:26:31.550 --> 00:26:34.080 align:middle line:84%
He was a representative
in Washington, also

00:26:34.080 --> 00:26:37.050 align:middle line:84%
the Vatican's head
exorcist for many years.

00:26:37.050 --> 00:26:39.000 align:middle line:84%
And he kindly consented
to an interview.

00:26:39.000 --> 00:26:41.080 align:middle line:90%
We ambushed him.

00:26:41.080 --> 00:26:42.530 align:middle line:90%
We ambushed him.

00:26:42.530 --> 00:26:46.720 align:middle line:84%
He said, look he thinks
this is, he said in Italian,

00:26:46.720 --> 00:26:49.650 align:middle line:90%
"falsa, falsa, falsa."

00:26:49.650 --> 00:26:53.640 align:middle line:84%
Well, he said look,
in India certainly

00:26:53.640 --> 00:26:56.050 align:middle line:84%
they wrote this
manuscript after they

00:26:56.050 --> 00:26:58.440 align:middle line:90%
knew the full story of Jesus.

00:26:58.440 --> 00:27:01.470 align:middle line:84%
So he said he claims
it's an invention.

00:27:01.470 --> 00:27:03.450 align:middle line:84%
The Vatican doesn't
accept it he says.

00:27:03.450 --> 00:27:05.515 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: He forgets that
it would have-- well, I

00:27:05.515 --> 00:27:06.890 align:middle line:84%
guess it wouldn't
have pre-dated,

00:27:06.890 --> 00:27:11.950 align:middle line:84%
but it would have pre-dated
any text that they have.

00:27:11.950 --> 00:27:14.930 align:middle line:84%
>>DAVIDS: The problem
is if we had our hands

00:27:14.930 --> 00:27:17.860 align:middle line:84%
on the original text
and science could study,

00:27:17.860 --> 00:27:19.420 align:middle line:90%
they could really tell us.

00:27:19.420 --> 00:27:24.670 align:middle line:84%
Because if it was written 500
years after the crucifixion,

00:27:24.670 --> 00:27:28.070 align:middle line:90%
well why should we believe it.

00:27:28.070 --> 00:27:32.050 align:middle line:84%
Except it does mention
Jagannath as one of the places

00:27:32.050 --> 00:27:32.950 align:middle line:90%
that Jesus went to.

00:27:32.950 --> 00:27:34.200 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So this
keeps coming up.

00:27:34.200 --> 00:27:35.408 align:middle line:90%
>>DAVIDS: It keeps coming up.

00:27:35.408 --> 00:27:39.900 align:middle line:84%
So we went to Puri where
Jagannath Temple is, which

00:27:39.900 --> 00:27:42.280 align:middle line:90%
is a great center of Hinduism.

00:27:42.280 --> 00:27:43.560 align:middle line:90%
The original temple exists.

00:27:43.560 --> 00:27:46.640 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: OK now let's-- let me
just get to something before we

00:27:46.640 --> 00:27:48.160 align:middle line:90%
go there and set this up.

00:27:48.160 --> 00:27:49.990 align:middle line:90%
>>DAVIDS: Sure.

00:27:49.990 --> 00:27:51.490 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: James
Deardorff was saying

00:27:51.490 --> 00:27:54.720 align:middle line:84%
that Islam does
not believe-- and I

00:27:54.720 --> 00:27:56.530 align:middle line:84%
think this is kind
of critical to it,

00:27:56.530 --> 00:28:01.300 align:middle line:84%
they do not believe that
Jesus died in the crucifixion.

00:28:01.300 --> 00:28:04.571 align:middle line:84%
And this has been brought up
in other streams of thought

00:28:04.571 --> 00:28:06.070 align:middle line:84%
as well and other
schools of thought

00:28:06.070 --> 00:28:09.150 align:middle line:84%
that he didn't die in the
crucifixion per se, that he was

00:28:09.150 --> 00:28:12.720 align:middle line:84%
simply elevated from there
or suffered, was taken down,

00:28:12.720 --> 00:28:17.900 align:middle line:84%
and then left and moved on,
and went back in later life,

00:28:17.900 --> 00:28:18.810 align:middle line:90%
back to the east.

00:28:18.810 --> 00:28:21.240 align:middle line:84%
Where as we say the Mother
Mary and Jesus supposedly die.

00:28:21.240 --> 00:28:22.660 align:middle line:90%
We haven't gotten there yet.

00:28:22.660 --> 00:28:24.920 align:middle line:84%
So the point is not
everybody believes

00:28:24.920 --> 00:28:28.545 align:middle line:84%
he died in the crucifixion,
particularly Islam.

00:28:28.545 --> 00:28:31.620 align:middle line:84%
>>DAVIDS: Well, what you've
just said about Islam is true.

00:28:31.620 --> 00:28:34.530 align:middle line:84%
But the trip to
Jagannath by Jesus

00:28:34.530 --> 00:28:38.820 align:middle line:84%
would be during those
missing years of 13 to 30.

00:28:38.820 --> 00:28:39.890 align:middle line:90%
So we're not the--

00:28:39.890 --> 00:28:40.270 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: We're not at that yet.

00:28:40.270 --> 00:28:42.392 align:middle line:84%
>>DAVIDS: --question of
after the crucifixion yet.

00:28:42.392 --> 00:28:43.350 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: You're right.

00:28:43.350 --> 00:28:46.760 align:middle line:84%
>>DAVIDS: And what's
important is, well

00:28:46.760 --> 00:28:52.070 align:middle line:84%
when we went to Puri first
of all we were fascinated

00:28:52.070 --> 00:28:55.018 align:middle line:84%
by the fact that a hermitage
that Paramahansa Yogananda had

00:28:55.018 --> 00:29:00.250 align:middle line:84%
studied at with his guru Sri
Teswar was located nearby.

00:29:00.250 --> 00:29:02.060 align:middle line:90%
And we were able to visit.

00:29:02.060 --> 00:29:03.460 align:middle line:90%
We were received with open arms.

00:29:03.460 --> 00:29:05.820 align:middle line:84%
But the question is
could we get an interview

00:29:05.820 --> 00:29:06.960 align:middle line:90%
with the Shankaracharya.

00:29:06.960 --> 00:29:08.360 align:middle line:84%
It's like getting an
interview with the pope.

00:29:08.360 --> 00:29:09.610 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: With the pope, yeah.

00:29:09.610 --> 00:29:11.220 align:middle line:84%
>>DAVIDS: And we're
waiting day by day

00:29:11.220 --> 00:29:13.740 align:middle line:90%
to see can we get an interview.

00:29:13.740 --> 00:29:16.980 align:middle line:84%
And I have a fellow
producer who I

00:29:16.980 --> 00:29:22.030 align:middle line:84%
invited into the project
who's from India, Anil Urmil.

00:29:22.030 --> 00:29:24.270 align:middle line:84%
And he had some
family connections

00:29:24.270 --> 00:29:27.940 align:middle line:84%
and he was-- he
got the word to me

00:29:27.940 --> 00:29:32.470 align:middle line:84%
that we may be able to meet
with the Shankaracharya

00:29:32.470 --> 00:29:34.275 align:middle line:84%
but you won't be
able to film him.

00:29:34.275 --> 00:29:35.900 align:middle line:84%
You won't be able to
have an interview.

00:29:35.900 --> 00:29:40.100 align:middle line:84%
You probably will not even be
able to have your picture taken

00:29:40.100 --> 00:29:40.970 align:middle line:90%
with him to prove.

00:29:40.970 --> 00:29:42.240 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: He didn't know
you had the force with you.

00:29:42.240 --> 00:29:43.073 align:middle line:90%
>>DAVIDS: He didn't.

00:29:43.073 --> 00:29:44.150 align:middle line:90%
He didn't know.

00:29:44.150 --> 00:29:45.890 align:middle line:90%
None of us knew that.

00:29:45.890 --> 00:29:48.600 align:middle line:84%
Because when we got
there-- well, what he said

00:29:48.600 --> 00:29:51.050 align:middle line:84%
is there's an American
filmmaker here.

00:29:51.050 --> 00:29:54.590 align:middle line:84%
And he loves
Paramahansa Yogananda

00:29:54.590 --> 00:29:55.790 align:middle line:90%
and the Shankaracharya.

00:29:55.790 --> 00:29:59.780 align:middle line:84%
He said oh, then
this Paul Davids, I

00:29:59.780 --> 00:30:02.460 align:middle line:84%
must consider him
an honorary Hindu.

00:30:02.460 --> 00:30:04.265 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Interesting OK.

00:30:04.265 --> 00:30:05.140 align:middle line:90%
>>DAVIDS: Come, come.

00:30:05.140 --> 00:30:05.410 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: That's how it--

00:30:05.410 --> 00:30:06.820 align:middle line:90%
>>DAVIDS: You have a camera.

00:30:06.820 --> 00:30:08.310 align:middle line:90%
Let's talk about Jesus in India.

00:30:08.310 --> 00:30:09.800 align:middle line:90%
I will tell you.

00:30:09.800 --> 00:30:15.790 align:middle line:84%
So we go into this room and
some of his followers are there.

00:30:15.790 --> 00:30:20.340 align:middle line:84%
There are four
Shankaracharyas in Hinduism.

00:30:20.340 --> 00:30:24.730 align:middle line:84%
But the one we met with is
like the leader of them all.

00:30:24.730 --> 00:30:27.580 align:middle line:84%
So this was like a
meeting with the pope.

00:30:27.580 --> 00:30:30.690 align:middle line:84%
And I don't know
what language he

00:30:30.690 --> 00:30:33.510 align:middle line:90%
spoke in-- Anil translated it.

00:30:33.510 --> 00:30:35.460 align:middle line:90%
We have subtitles.

00:30:35.460 --> 00:30:39.450 align:middle line:84%
But we asked him and
he said, oh absolutely.

00:30:39.450 --> 00:30:40.940 align:middle line:90%
Jesus was here.

00:30:40.940 --> 00:30:44.190 align:middle line:84%
He said you know the tradition
a Shankaracharya goes back

00:30:44.190 --> 00:30:46.750 align:middle line:90%
2,500 years approximately.

00:30:46.750 --> 00:30:50.610 align:middle line:84%
And Jesus would have met the
Shankaracharya of that day.

00:30:50.610 --> 00:30:55.600 align:middle line:84%
And he was here for
years studying with us

00:30:55.600 --> 00:31:02.440 align:middle line:84%
and learning the scriptures,
the Hindu scriptures.

00:31:02.440 --> 00:31:05.880 align:middle line:84%
And he listed what Jesus
would have studied there,

00:31:05.880 --> 00:31:10.190 align:middle line:84%
and that there was-- let's
see if I can remember.

00:31:10.190 --> 00:31:20.590 align:middle line:84%
But it was a truthfulness,
compassion, service to others,

00:31:20.590 --> 00:31:24.230 align:middle line:90%
patience, love, all of the--

00:31:24.230 --> 00:31:25.030 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Virtues.

00:31:25.030 --> 00:31:26.850 align:middle line:90%
>>DAVIDS: --all of the virtues.

00:31:26.850 --> 00:31:32.350 align:middle line:84%
And certainly patience is one
of the virtues of Hinduism

00:31:32.350 --> 00:31:34.450 align:middle line:84%
and Buddhism I
think, maybe more so

00:31:34.450 --> 00:31:36.650 align:middle line:90%
than what we have in the West.

00:31:36.650 --> 00:31:41.580 align:middle line:84%
But he could not produce
the ancient scrolls

00:31:41.580 --> 00:31:44.070 align:middle line:90%
that would have supported this.

00:31:44.070 --> 00:31:48.370 align:middle line:84%
He said that during ancient
invasions these were all hidden

00:31:48.370 --> 00:31:50.280 align:middle line:84%
and they don't have
access to them today.

00:31:50.280 --> 00:31:52.860 align:middle line:84%
But this is a
tradition that has been

00:31:52.860 --> 00:31:56.600 align:middle line:84%
known by all the Shankaracharyas
going back to the days of Jesus

00:31:56.600 --> 00:31:58.560 align:middle line:90%
that he was there.

00:31:58.560 --> 00:32:01.640 align:middle line:84%
Now this was the first
time I think in history

00:32:01.640 --> 00:32:04.280 align:middle line:84%
that a filmmaker had
gotten a religious leader

00:32:04.280 --> 00:32:07.220 align:middle line:84%
of this magnitude to make
those statements, which

00:32:07.220 --> 00:32:10.320 align:middle line:84%
were completely diametrically
opposite to what

00:32:10.320 --> 00:32:13.450 align:middle line:84%
we heard from Monsignor
Balducci at the Vatican.

00:32:13.450 --> 00:32:15.330 align:middle line:84%
And in editing
this movie I think

00:32:15.330 --> 00:32:17.920 align:middle line:84%
one of the key
points of it is when

00:32:17.920 --> 00:32:22.180 align:middle line:84%
I cut the two of them together
back to back saying completely

00:32:22.180 --> 00:32:24.610 align:middle line:90%
contradictory things.

00:32:24.610 --> 00:32:30.480 align:middle line:84%
Now the secret life of Jesus
the Christ, that document

00:32:30.480 --> 00:32:37.200 align:middle line:84%
from Hemis monastery, it says
that Jesus got into trouble

00:32:37.200 --> 00:32:38.624 align:middle line:90%
in his days among the Hindus.

00:32:38.624 --> 00:32:41.040 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Found that-- yes, I
found that fascinating, yes.

00:32:41.040 --> 00:32:42.623 align:middle line:84%
>>DAVIDS: It paints
a picture of Jesus

00:32:42.623 --> 00:32:46.320 align:middle line:84%
that is completely consistent
with the Jesus that we know.

00:32:46.320 --> 00:32:51.150 align:middle line:84%
It's not an all honey and
roses picture of Jesus there.

00:32:51.150 --> 00:32:54.270 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: No, well, Jesus was
considered to be an activist.

00:32:54.270 --> 00:32:55.270 align:middle line:90%
>>DAVIDS: He challenged.

00:32:55.270 --> 00:32:57.145 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: He challenged
people, and certainly

00:32:57.145 --> 00:33:00.270 align:middle line:84%
the people in Rome didn't
care much for his ways.

00:33:00.270 --> 00:33:03.640 align:middle line:84%
>>DAVIDS: Yes, well
he-- what he did was

00:33:03.640 --> 00:33:06.060 align:middle line:90%
object to the caste system.

00:33:06.060 --> 00:33:07.610 align:middle line:90%
You can't do that among Hindus.

00:33:07.610 --> 00:33:08.660 align:middle line:90%
They have four castes.

00:33:08.660 --> 00:33:10.326 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: The Brahmin,
he said this is--

00:33:10.326 --> 00:33:13.650 align:middle line:84%
>>DAVIDS: The Brahmins,
those are the top people.

00:33:13.650 --> 00:33:18.270 align:middle line:10%
He objected to how they
were so aloof and put

00:33:18.270 --> 00:33:23.190 align:middle line:10%
themself in such a privileged
position up on a pedestal.

00:33:23.190 --> 00:33:24.890 align:middle line:90%
So he attacked the Brahmins.

00:33:24.890 --> 00:33:29.440 align:middle line:84%
And the lowest caste of course
would be the untouchables.

00:33:29.440 --> 00:33:31.150 align:middle line:84%
Well, you certainly
wouldn't read to them

00:33:31.150 --> 00:33:33.390 align:middle line:90%
the holy scriptures.

00:33:33.390 --> 00:33:35.887 align:middle line:84%
They'll get to hear the holy
scriptures when they come back

00:33:35.887 --> 00:33:37.970 align:middle line:84%
on their next incarnation,
if they're lucky enough

00:33:37.970 --> 00:33:40.440 align:middle line:84%
to be further up the
chain, but not now.

00:33:40.440 --> 00:33:44.162 align:middle line:90%
Well, he violated that.

00:33:44.162 --> 00:33:48.400 align:middle line:84%
He anchored them to the
point where an assassin

00:33:48.400 --> 00:33:51.950 align:middle line:90%
was hired to do away with him.

00:33:51.950 --> 00:33:55.390 align:middle line:84%
Now this is the story in
that ancient manuscript.

00:33:55.390 --> 00:33:57.810 align:middle line:84%
And it's completely
consistent with the Jesus

00:33:57.810 --> 00:34:00.350 align:middle line:90%
who in Judea in Israel.

00:34:00.350 --> 00:34:02.700 align:middle line:84%
He would've gone into
the temple and thrown

00:34:02.700 --> 00:34:06.080 align:middle line:84%
over the tables of
the money changers,

00:34:06.080 --> 00:34:08.389 align:middle line:84%
and saying not in
my father's house.

00:34:08.389 --> 00:34:10.809 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: He spoke his
truth wherever he went.

00:34:10.809 --> 00:34:15.080 align:middle line:84%
>>DAVIDS: Yeah, it's
supportive of that.

00:34:15.080 --> 00:34:16.270 align:middle line:90%
This is fascinating.

00:34:16.270 --> 00:34:20.290 align:middle line:84%
Well, the claim is that then
he left and he went northward

00:34:20.290 --> 00:34:24.690 align:middle line:84%
actually to the land of the
birthplace of the Buddha.

00:34:24.690 --> 00:34:28.850 align:middle line:84%
I don't think I can pronounce
it, but as part of his journey

00:34:28.850 --> 00:34:30.179 align:middle line:90%
there.

00:34:30.179 --> 00:34:35.080 align:middle line:84%
So we had this confirmation
from the Shankaracharya.

00:34:35.080 --> 00:34:39.659 align:middle line:84%
What we really needed was
to get to Hemis monastery

00:34:39.659 --> 00:34:42.060 align:middle line:84%
and find out what's
their position.

00:34:42.060 --> 00:34:43.940 align:middle line:90%
Can we see the document?

00:34:43.940 --> 00:34:45.659 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: You made it there.

00:34:45.659 --> 00:34:47.790 align:middle line:84%
>>DAVIDS: Well we-- I
sent part of my crew.

00:34:47.790 --> 00:34:48.790 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah OK.

00:34:48.790 --> 00:34:49.955 align:middle line:84%
>>DAVIDS: I couldn't
personally go.

00:34:49.955 --> 00:34:50.739 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Part of
the crew, all right.

00:34:50.739 --> 00:34:51.699 align:middle line:90%
>>DAVIDS: As a matter of fact--

00:34:51.699 --> 00:34:54.210 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: I didn't know if you
actually personally had or not.

00:34:54.210 --> 00:34:55.880 align:middle line:84%
>>DAVIDS: 14,000 feet would've
been a little tough for me.

00:34:55.880 --> 00:34:57.005 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Too much for you.

00:34:57.005 --> 00:34:58.729 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:34:58.729 --> 00:35:00.520 align:middle line:84%
>>DAVIDS: Ed has climbed
a lot of mountains

00:35:00.520 --> 00:35:04.400 align:middle line:84%
and he really
wanted to go there.

00:35:04.400 --> 00:35:09.330 align:middle line:84%
But when we had been
to Kashmir, that

00:35:09.330 --> 00:35:11.510 align:middle line:84%
was going to be our
next destination.

00:35:11.510 --> 00:35:14.820 align:middle line:84%
We were going to fly to
Ladakh and go to Hemis.

00:35:14.820 --> 00:35:17.317 align:middle line:90%


00:35:17.317 --> 00:35:19.400 align:middle line:84%
Let me backtrack and tell
you what happened to us.

00:35:19.400 --> 00:35:21.980 align:middle line:90%


00:35:21.980 --> 00:35:27.120 align:middle line:84%
We heard that the plane we were
assigned to that we had tickets

00:35:27.120 --> 00:35:31.800 align:middle line:84%
for, that the prime
minister or the head,

00:35:31.800 --> 00:35:36.670 align:middle line:84%
the president of Kashmir was
going to be on that plane

00:35:36.670 --> 00:35:40.740 align:middle line:84%
with many people who worked
with him from the government.

00:35:40.740 --> 00:35:43.320 align:middle line:84%
And there had been multiple
assassination attempts

00:35:43.320 --> 00:35:45.630 align:middle line:90%
against him.

00:35:45.630 --> 00:35:49.880 align:middle line:84%
And the day before we
heard on the street

00:35:49.880 --> 00:35:54.500 align:middle line:84%
through the Muslim who
was part of our crew

00:35:54.500 --> 00:35:56.310 align:middle line:84%
that everyone on
the street seemed

00:35:56.310 --> 00:35:59.640 align:middle line:84%
to know that this man was
going to be on that plane.

00:35:59.640 --> 00:36:03.400 align:middle line:84%
And it was probably going
to be a target and somebody

00:36:03.400 --> 00:36:05.690 align:middle line:90%
might try to shoot it down.

00:36:05.690 --> 00:36:10.220 align:middle line:84%
So we decided, well we're
not going out on that plane.

00:36:10.220 --> 00:36:15.340 align:middle line:84%
Well we hadn't brought much
money with us to Kashmir.

00:36:15.340 --> 00:36:20.590 align:middle line:84%
We figured well we'll charge it,
tickets to get another plane.

00:36:20.590 --> 00:36:22.972 align:middle line:84%
First of all there wasn't
another plane out to Ladakh

00:36:22.972 --> 00:36:23.930 align:middle line:90%
that was going to work.

00:36:23.930 --> 00:36:26.060 align:middle line:84%
And second of all they
didn't accept charge cards,

00:36:26.060 --> 00:36:27.314 align:middle line:90%
and we were out of money.

00:36:27.314 --> 00:36:28.980 align:middle line:84%
We didn't even have
enough money to stay

00:36:28.980 --> 00:36:30.650 align:middle line:90%
in a hotel another night there.

00:36:30.650 --> 00:36:34.850 align:middle line:84%
We were on Dal Lake
in a houseboat.

00:36:34.850 --> 00:36:36.510 align:middle line:90%
We were really stuck.

00:36:36.510 --> 00:36:39.530 align:middle line:84%
We were there in the airport,
which was our refuge.

00:36:39.530 --> 00:36:42.080 align:middle line:84%
And we knew they were going
to kick us out of the airport

00:36:42.080 --> 00:36:47.020 align:middle line:84%
soon because we didn't
have a valid ticket.

00:36:47.020 --> 00:36:53.060 align:middle line:84%
Calls were made to one of our
associate producers in India.

00:36:53.060 --> 00:36:54.630 align:middle line:84%
And I think it was
a Sunday and he

00:36:54.630 --> 00:36:59.300 align:middle line:84%
had to get a banker he knew
to go into a bank on a Sunday

00:36:59.300 --> 00:37:03.680 align:middle line:84%
and wire the money to
get us out of there.

00:37:03.680 --> 00:37:07.980 align:middle line:84%
It was absolutely harrowing
because we were Americans there

00:37:07.980 --> 00:37:11.640 align:middle line:90%
and we were targets.

00:37:11.640 --> 00:37:13.300 align:middle line:90%
I went into a little curio shop.

00:37:13.300 --> 00:37:14.880 align:middle line:84%
We were trying to
use a telephone

00:37:14.880 --> 00:37:16.890 align:middle line:90%
to call this man in India.

00:37:16.890 --> 00:37:18.820 align:middle line:84%
And there were some
people who came in

00:37:18.820 --> 00:37:21.060 align:middle line:84%
and they sold knives
in this curio shop.

00:37:21.060 --> 00:37:25.190 align:middle line:84%
And someone picked up a knife
and was gleefully playing

00:37:25.190 --> 00:37:26.470 align:middle line:90%
with it and pointing it at me.

00:37:26.470 --> 00:37:29.700 align:middle line:90%


00:37:29.700 --> 00:37:34.140 align:middle line:84%
Could I be another little
notch on his knife.

00:37:34.140 --> 00:37:36.820 align:middle line:90%
So it wasn't fun.

00:37:36.820 --> 00:37:37.620 align:middle line:90%
It was scary.

00:37:37.620 --> 00:37:40.670 align:middle line:84%
So we didn't get to
Hemis on that trip.

00:37:40.670 --> 00:37:47.740 align:middle line:84%
Later I sent my assistant
director who is Hindu.

00:37:47.740 --> 00:37:51.260 align:middle line:84%
And he got the footage up
there and he got an interview

00:37:51.260 --> 00:37:52.390 align:middle line:90%
with one of the top people.

00:37:52.390 --> 00:37:53.860 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Yes, that's the
one I'm referring to, yes.

00:37:53.860 --> 00:37:55.720 align:middle line:84%
>>DAVIDS: Top people
from the Hemis monk.

00:37:55.720 --> 00:37:59.219 align:middle line:84%
This interview was
really curious.

00:37:59.219 --> 00:38:00.760 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Should we
take a look at it

00:38:00.760 --> 00:38:02.730 align:middle line:84%
and then you can explain
to us what this meant.

00:38:02.730 --> 00:38:03.530 align:middle line:90%
Let's take a look.

00:38:03.530 --> 00:39:05.900 align:middle line:90%


00:39:05.900 --> 00:39:09.930 align:middle line:84%
>>The lamas were not allowed
to open the archives which

00:39:09.930 --> 00:39:12.090 align:middle line:90%
are just bound with strings.

00:39:12.090 --> 00:39:14.490 align:middle line:84%
But the head lama, who
had given the orders

00:39:14.490 --> 00:39:17.120 align:middle line:84%
that they were sealed and
should not be opened until he

00:39:17.120 --> 00:39:18.120 align:middle line:90%
returned.

00:39:18.120 --> 00:39:19.870 align:middle line:84%
>>DAVIDS: What we knew
from that interview

00:39:19.870 --> 00:39:24.290 align:middle line:84%
was that they had many, many
ancient manuscripts there.

00:39:24.290 --> 00:39:28.560 align:middle line:84%
You could see them and
they're on these shelves.

00:39:28.560 --> 00:39:32.410 align:middle line:84%
And the lama explains,
well it's locked.

00:39:32.410 --> 00:39:33.590 align:middle line:90%
You can't touch that.

00:39:33.590 --> 00:39:34.910 align:middle line:90%
What does he mean by a lock?

00:39:34.910 --> 00:39:37.220 align:middle line:84%
It's not exactly what we
mean by a lock in the West.

00:39:37.220 --> 00:39:38.511 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: A lock and key, yeah.

00:39:38.511 --> 00:39:40.150 align:middle line:84%
>>DAVIDS: It's not
a combination lock.

00:39:40.150 --> 00:39:41.430 align:middle line:90%
It doesn't have a key.

00:39:41.430 --> 00:39:43.410 align:middle line:90%
It's a piece of yarn.

00:39:43.410 --> 00:39:46.510 align:middle line:84%
It's a piece of string tied to
hold the two doors together.

00:39:46.510 --> 00:39:48.640 align:middle line:90%
Why is that a lock?

00:39:48.640 --> 00:39:52.342 align:middle line:84%
Because it's been commanded
by their head lama.

00:39:52.342 --> 00:39:54.496 align:middle line:84%
You don't open those
until I'm back.

00:39:54.496 --> 00:39:56.370 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: He's been gone
for years hasn't he?

00:39:56.370 --> 00:39:57.350 align:middle line:90%
>>DAVIDS: Yes, yes.

00:39:57.350 --> 00:39:59.770 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: No one knows when
he's coming back, if ever.

00:39:59.770 --> 00:40:00.936 align:middle line:90%
>>DAVIDS: Is he coming back?

00:40:00.936 --> 00:40:03.260 align:middle line:90%
He left as a boy.

00:40:03.260 --> 00:40:07.700 align:middle line:84%
And he was in Tibet and then
the Chinese communists come.

00:40:07.700 --> 00:40:09.560 align:middle line:84%
Do they even know
if he's still alive?

00:40:09.560 --> 00:40:13.620 align:middle line:84%
But they say that their
translation project

00:40:13.620 --> 00:40:15.212 align:middle line:90%
of the documents is held up.

00:40:15.212 --> 00:40:17.170 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Until he returns,
which may be never.

00:40:17.170 --> 00:40:17.690 align:middle line:84%
>>DAVIDS: Until he
returns, of course.

00:40:17.690 --> 00:40:19.065 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Wait
for the next lama.

00:40:19.065 --> 00:40:21.650 align:middle line:84%
>>DAVIDS: Of course,
now and the other thing

00:40:21.650 --> 00:40:26.680 align:middle line:84%
about the answer that
was so curious was

00:40:26.680 --> 00:40:32.680 align:middle line:84%
the person we were interviewing
said, look it's not up to me

00:40:32.680 --> 00:40:33.500 align:middle line:90%
to tell you.

00:40:33.500 --> 00:40:40.040 align:middle line:84%
I can't do this alone,
because this could involve--

00:40:40.040 --> 00:40:44.400 align:middle line:84%
it could be so sensational
that it would have

00:40:44.400 --> 00:40:47.080 align:middle line:90%
to be done by the committee.

00:40:47.080 --> 00:40:49.270 align:middle line:84%
It can't be one person
making the decision alone.

00:40:49.270 --> 00:40:55.500 align:middle line:84%
This could have repercussions
if we were able to confirm this

00:40:55.500 --> 00:40:57.620 align:middle line:90%
and I don't if we can.

00:40:57.620 --> 00:41:01.070 align:middle line:84%
I personally don't know where
the document would be he said.

00:41:01.070 --> 00:41:03.430 align:middle line:84%
But he said I have
heard the stories too.

00:41:03.430 --> 00:41:05.350 align:middle line:84%
He said researchers
have come here

00:41:05.350 --> 00:41:08.310 align:middle line:84%
who've said they talked
to the Dalai Lama,

00:41:08.310 --> 00:41:10.610 align:middle line:84%
and that the Dalai Lama
had confirmed privately

00:41:10.610 --> 00:41:13.390 align:middle line:84%
for them that when
he was a boy in Tibet

00:41:13.390 --> 00:41:19.870 align:middle line:84%
he saw that version of
the document of Issa.

00:41:19.870 --> 00:41:22.980 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: The document that
Nicolas-- the secret life

00:41:22.980 --> 00:41:24.220 align:middle line:90%
of Jesus Christ.

00:41:24.220 --> 00:41:28.020 align:middle line:84%
>>DAVIDS: Yes, the
story of Saint Issa

00:41:28.020 --> 00:41:29.920 align:middle line:84%
that he sought in
the poly language

00:41:29.920 --> 00:41:35.230 align:middle line:84%
it would have been at the
Maribor monastery in Tibet

00:41:35.230 --> 00:41:37.900 align:middle line:84%
and that the Dalai
Lama was aware of it.

00:41:37.900 --> 00:41:40.910 align:middle line:84%
So the men we were
interviewing said look,

00:41:40.910 --> 00:41:43.510 align:middle line:84%
we can't say that this-- we
don't know where it would be.

00:41:43.510 --> 00:41:46.100 align:middle line:84%
Now I'm asking why wouldn't
they know where it would be.

00:41:46.100 --> 00:41:49.300 align:middle line:84%
Because when we know that
Nicolas Notovitch saw it.

00:41:49.300 --> 00:41:51.750 align:middle line:90%
Swami Abhedananda saw it.

00:41:51.750 --> 00:41:53.740 align:middle line:90%
Nicholas Roerich saw it.

00:41:53.740 --> 00:41:55.450 align:middle line:90%
Madame Caspari saw it.

00:41:55.450 --> 00:41:57.310 align:middle line:90%
We have two translations of it.

00:41:57.310 --> 00:41:58.550 align:middle line:90%
It exists.

00:41:58.550 --> 00:42:02.420 align:middle line:84%
Max Muller who debunked the
whole thing absolutely wrong.

00:42:02.420 --> 00:42:05.120 align:middle line:84%
And I wish all of the Christian
websites who are still

00:42:05.120 --> 00:42:07.600 align:middle line:84%
claiming that it's
a made up story

00:42:07.600 --> 00:42:11.590 align:middle line:84%
because Max Muller proved
that would back off and change

00:42:11.590 --> 00:42:12.480 align:middle line:90%
their position.

00:42:12.480 --> 00:42:14.600 align:middle line:90%
That's absolutely wrong.

00:42:14.600 --> 00:42:17.000 align:middle line:90%
It does exist or it did exist.

00:42:17.000 --> 00:42:20.540 align:middle line:84%
The question is how old is it
and why can't we see it today.

00:42:20.540 --> 00:42:22.170 align:middle line:84%
Is the reason we
can't see it today

00:42:22.170 --> 00:42:24.630 align:middle line:84%
because the Vatican
made arrangements

00:42:24.630 --> 00:42:27.594 align:middle line:84%
to take possession of it,
sometime maybe in the 1930s

00:42:27.594 --> 00:42:28.760 align:middle line:90%
after Madame Caspari saw it.

00:42:28.760 --> 00:42:30.760 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA MEREDITH: It
could be, yeah absolutely.

00:42:30.760 --> 00:42:32.650 align:middle line:84%
>>DAVIDS: That it
is no longer there.

00:42:32.650 --> 00:42:35.880 align:middle line:84%
Or they have instructions that
they can't show it to anybody

00:42:35.880 --> 00:42:38.290 align:middle line:84%
because of the
explosion or the furor

00:42:38.290 --> 00:42:40.640 align:middle line:84%
it would make in the
whole Christian world.

00:42:40.640 --> 00:42:43.730 align:middle line:84%
If the Vatican had to address
the fact that there really

00:42:43.730 --> 00:42:46.250 align:middle line:84%
is information
about those missing.

00:42:46.250 --> 00:42:48.390 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Well, and that
his teachings were heavily

00:42:48.390 --> 00:42:49.640 align:middle line:90%
influenced by eastern thought.

00:42:49.640 --> 00:42:50.440 align:middle line:90%
>>DAVIDS: That too.

00:42:50.440 --> 00:42:52.160 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: They're so
terrified of that.

00:42:52.160 --> 00:42:54.170 align:middle line:84%
>>DAVIDS: Well,
they won't go there.

00:42:54.170 --> 00:42:56.360 align:middle line:90%
They disallow it.

00:42:56.360 --> 00:42:59.050 align:middle line:84%
It all came from
divine knowledge

00:42:59.050 --> 00:43:02.034 align:middle line:84%
because of who he was, as
the story of the Vatican--

00:43:02.034 --> 00:43:03.950 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: As though it's
less divine if you go

00:43:03.950 --> 00:43:06.405 align:middle line:84%
and you have knowledge
presented to you

00:43:06.405 --> 00:43:08.200 align:middle line:90%
and experienced elsewhere.

00:43:08.200 --> 00:43:11.880 align:middle line:84%
>>DAVIDS: But the point of view
of those in the east in India

00:43:11.880 --> 00:43:16.030 align:middle line:84%
particularly is-- and
India, which is a country

00:43:16.030 --> 00:43:18.050 align:middle line:84%
divided between
Hindus and Muslims.

00:43:18.050 --> 00:43:19.380 align:middle line:90%
Yes there are Catholics there.

00:43:19.380 --> 00:43:22.600 align:middle line:84%
There are Christians,
certainly in Goa where we were.

00:43:22.600 --> 00:43:27.720 align:middle line:84%
But most of the Muslims
ended up in Pakistan

00:43:27.720 --> 00:43:31.990 align:middle line:84%
after the division of the
country after the British left.

00:43:31.990 --> 00:43:36.680 align:middle line:84%
And most Hindu-- India
itself is mainly Hindu.

00:43:36.680 --> 00:43:38.710 align:middle line:84%
But you have these
two different cultures

00:43:38.710 --> 00:43:44.190 align:middle line:84%
that both know of the
story of Saint Issa.

00:43:44.190 --> 00:43:52.150 align:middle line:84%
So their feeling is that if
Christianity acknowledged

00:43:52.150 --> 00:43:58.580 align:middle line:84%
Jesus' travels in India, that
he was the king of travelers,

00:43:58.580 --> 00:44:03.390 align:middle line:84%
that it would have a soothing
and bonding and binding

00:44:03.390 --> 00:44:08.220 align:middle line:84%
effect on the disparities
between the religions.

00:44:08.220 --> 00:44:11.180 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So that's where the
comment by Sir Jonathan Sacks

00:44:11.180 --> 00:44:15.230 align:middle line:84%
comes in, because he's
trying to find a way

00:44:15.230 --> 00:44:17.720 align:middle line:84%
to look at these
religions and he

00:44:17.720 --> 00:44:20.080 align:middle line:84%
thinks this might be
the bonding agent.

00:44:20.080 --> 00:44:22.450 align:middle line:84%
If these years of Jesus,
having been heavily

00:44:22.450 --> 00:44:26.520 align:middle line:84%
influence and respectful of
both Buddhism and Hinduism,

00:44:26.520 --> 00:44:29.540 align:middle line:84%
could be the bond that would
bridge all of these cultures

00:44:29.540 --> 00:44:32.260 align:middle line:90%
spiritually once and for all.

00:44:32.260 --> 00:44:37.740 align:middle line:84%
>>DAVIDS: Yes, in our film
it's a famous rabbi professor

00:44:37.740 --> 00:44:42.980 align:middle line:84%
from Loyola University who makes
that point and talks about what

00:44:42.980 --> 00:44:47.260 align:middle line:84%
is the Jewish perspective
on these questions.

00:44:47.260 --> 00:44:54.280 align:middle line:84%
And of course Judaism doesn't
incorporate Jesus, certainly

00:44:54.280 --> 00:44:57.400 align:middle line:84%
not as a messiah
and doesn't even

00:44:57.400 --> 00:45:01.860 align:middle line:84%
know whether to acknowledge
the historicity of whether he

00:45:01.860 --> 00:45:03.039 align:middle line:90%
really lived.

00:45:03.039 --> 00:45:04.080 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Existed, right.

00:45:04.080 --> 00:45:06.420 align:middle line:84%
>>DAVIDS: So
Judaism doesn't have

00:45:06.420 --> 00:45:09.540 align:middle line:90%
a point of view about that.

00:45:09.540 --> 00:45:14.280 align:middle line:84%
But they do have the point of
view that if Jesus did exist,

00:45:14.280 --> 00:45:17.570 align:middle line:84%
certainly he was more Jewish
than most contemporary Jews

00:45:17.570 --> 00:45:19.240 align:middle line:90%
in the United States today.

00:45:19.240 --> 00:45:21.270 align:middle line:90%
Certainly he kept kosher.

00:45:21.270 --> 00:45:25.950 align:middle line:84%
We know that the Last
Supper was Passover.

00:45:25.950 --> 00:45:31.260 align:middle line:84%
So he comes firmly from
a Judaic tradition.

00:45:31.260 --> 00:45:33.630 align:middle line:84%
But the picture of Jesus
that emerges from this

00:45:33.630 --> 00:45:37.390 align:middle line:84%
is one who sought
the missing tribes.

00:45:37.390 --> 00:45:40.570 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Which were disbursed
throughout the Middle

00:45:40.570 --> 00:45:42.220 align:middle line:90%
East and the Near East.

00:45:42.220 --> 00:45:49.310 align:middle line:84%
>>DAVIDS: Yes, and then
came back to Israel

00:45:49.310 --> 00:45:54.750 align:middle line:84%
to preach a new
way of life which

00:45:54.750 --> 00:45:58.230 align:middle line:84%
had the virtues of
those other religions

00:45:58.230 --> 00:46:02.990 align:middle line:84%
and was opposed to
the Old Testament

00:46:02.990 --> 00:46:07.390 align:middle line:84%
philosophy of an eye
for an eye, that you

00:46:07.390 --> 00:46:11.800 align:middle line:84%
repay violence with violence
and the vengeful god

00:46:11.800 --> 00:46:16.590 align:middle line:84%
of the Old Testament who
was always sending plagues

00:46:16.590 --> 00:46:17.640 align:middle line:90%
upon mankind.

00:46:17.640 --> 00:46:20.890 align:middle line:84%
He preached a
different approach.

00:46:20.890 --> 00:46:25.040 align:middle line:84%
It was unpopular among
the Romans and the Jews

00:46:25.040 --> 00:46:26.130 align:middle line:90%
at that time.

00:46:26.130 --> 00:46:28.290 align:middle line:90%
He ended up on across.

00:46:28.290 --> 00:46:33.570 align:middle line:84%
So nevertheless, the
Hindus and the Muslims

00:46:33.570 --> 00:46:35.510 align:middle line:84%
that I talked to
in India all felt,

00:46:35.510 --> 00:46:39.112 align:middle line:84%
oh if only the West would
acknowledge this how

00:46:39.112 --> 00:46:41.120 align:middle line:90%
it would bring us all together.

00:46:41.120 --> 00:46:46.390 align:middle line:84%
That Jesus instead of being a
dividing between our religions

00:46:46.390 --> 00:46:51.740 align:middle line:84%
would now be Saint Issa who
brings us all closer together.

00:46:51.740 --> 00:46:53.930 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Well, and
there are other hallmarks

00:46:53.930 --> 00:46:54.750 align:middle line:90%
of that presence.

00:46:54.750 --> 00:46:58.880 align:middle line:84%
You brought up Judaism,
there are oddly

00:46:58.880 --> 00:47:02.890 align:middle line:84%
a lot of-- the presence of a
lot of Jewish or Hebrew names

00:47:02.890 --> 00:47:04.680 align:middle line:90%
in India for example.

00:47:04.680 --> 00:47:05.930 align:middle line:90%
It's like how did that happen.

00:47:05.930 --> 00:47:08.890 align:middle line:84%
And the thought is that some
of the missing tribes of Israel

00:47:08.890 --> 00:47:10.404 align:middle line:84%
may well have been
that far east.

00:47:10.404 --> 00:47:11.820 align:middle line:84%
>>DAVIDS: Yes, as
a matter of fact

00:47:11.820 --> 00:47:14.070 align:middle line:84%
we talk in the film
about someone who

00:47:14.070 --> 00:47:18.280 align:middle line:84%
received a commission to do
research and study on behalf

00:47:18.280 --> 00:47:21.360 align:middle line:84%
of the government of India
as to why there are so

00:47:21.360 --> 00:47:25.700 align:middle line:84%
many Hebrew names of places
spread out throughout India.

00:47:25.700 --> 00:47:29.650 align:middle line:84%
And in Kashmir the
connections are even stronger.

00:47:29.650 --> 00:47:33.240 align:middle line:84%
There is the theory
that the Kasmiris

00:47:33.240 --> 00:47:38.970 align:middle line:84%
are one of the lost
tribes, that the language

00:47:38.970 --> 00:47:43.020 align:middle line:84%
has many common root
words as Hebrew.

00:47:43.020 --> 00:47:49.090 align:middle line:84%
Customs are similar, tools,
even the shape of the paddle

00:47:49.090 --> 00:47:52.360 align:middle line:84%
used at Dal Lake was
the shape of a heart

00:47:52.360 --> 00:47:54.050 align:middle line:90%
shaped paddle that was--

00:47:54.050 --> 00:47:55.240 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: That was an
interesting part of the film

00:47:55.240 --> 00:47:56.190 align:middle line:90%
as well.

00:47:56.190 --> 00:47:57.814 align:middle line:84%
You had the physical
evidence for that.

00:47:57.814 --> 00:48:00.914 align:middle line:84%
>>DAVIDS: And there's a
genetic confirmation connecting

00:48:00.914 --> 00:48:01.830 align:middle line:90%
the people of Kashmir.

00:48:01.830 --> 00:48:03.820 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: The DNA pools, yes.

00:48:03.820 --> 00:48:08.090 align:middle line:84%
>>DAVIDS: So is it far fetched
that Jesus, if his mission was

00:48:08.090 --> 00:48:10.960 align:middle line:84%
to reunite the lost tribes,
is it far-fetched that he

00:48:10.960 --> 00:48:12.310 align:middle line:90%
would have gone to Kashmir.

00:48:12.310 --> 00:48:13.985 align:middle line:90%
No, of course not.

00:48:13.985 --> 00:48:15.610 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Let's talk
about the presence

00:48:15.610 --> 00:48:18.150 align:middle line:90%
of Saint Thomas in India.

00:48:18.150 --> 00:48:19.370 align:middle line:90%
>>DAVIDS: It's a great point.

00:48:19.370 --> 00:48:20.750 align:middle line:90%
It really is a great point.

00:48:20.750 --> 00:48:23.840 align:middle line:84%
Because for those Christians
who have a problem

00:48:23.840 --> 00:48:26.690 align:middle line:84%
with the idea of
Jesus' travels, they

00:48:26.690 --> 00:48:32.910 align:middle line:84%
should ask themselves why did
Jesus send Thomas to India.

00:48:32.910 --> 00:48:35.270 align:middle line:84%
Why was it Saint
Thomas, doubting

00:48:35.270 --> 00:48:42.150 align:middle line:84%
Thomas who goes to India
and founds a church there

00:48:42.150 --> 00:48:46.670 align:middle line:84%
and spreads Christianity
for the first time in India.

00:48:46.670 --> 00:48:48.200 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Which
exists to this day.

00:48:48.200 --> 00:48:49.158 align:middle line:90%
>>DAVIDS: You could go.

00:48:49.158 --> 00:48:49.970 align:middle line:90%
We did go.

00:48:49.970 --> 00:48:54.090 align:middle line:84%
And it's in the film to
the Church of Saint Thomas.

00:48:54.090 --> 00:48:59.590 align:middle line:84%
It's probably been rebuilt but
that's where his church was.

00:48:59.590 --> 00:49:04.140 align:middle line:84%
And there is a cathedral for
Thomas there, a Thomas museum.

00:49:04.140 --> 00:49:07.340 align:middle line:84%
And the confirmation that this
part of the Christian story

00:49:07.340 --> 00:49:11.420 align:middle line:84%
is true you can take
from Pope John Paul

00:49:11.420 --> 00:49:18.450 align:middle line:84%
II who went there to pay homage
to Saint Thomas, went to India.

00:49:18.450 --> 00:49:22.500 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So a precedent
of travelers in association

00:49:22.500 --> 00:49:24.810 align:middle line:84%
with Jesus who had gone
to India has already

00:49:24.810 --> 00:49:26.170 align:middle line:90%
been well established.

00:49:26.170 --> 00:49:28.050 align:middle line:84%
>>DAVIDS: Yes, one of
the original apostles

00:49:28.050 --> 00:49:30.810 align:middle line:84%
spends the rest of his life
and dies after about 20 years

00:49:30.810 --> 00:49:31.610 align:middle line:90%
there.

00:49:31.610 --> 00:49:34.360 align:middle line:84%
He's assassinated by
a Hindu by the way.

00:49:34.360 --> 00:49:41.220 align:middle line:84%
But devotes himself to the
introduction of Christianity

00:49:41.220 --> 00:49:43.990 align:middle line:84%
into that culture and
Christianity spreads.

00:49:43.990 --> 00:49:46.370 align:middle line:84%
And there are Catholic
communities now.

00:49:46.370 --> 00:49:48.627 align:middle line:84%
Certainly Goa is very
Catholic, I would say.

00:49:48.627 --> 00:49:49.710 align:middle line:90%
The Portuguese brought it.

00:49:49.710 --> 00:49:52.490 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Portuguese, but
that wasn't reflected back

00:49:52.490 --> 00:49:54.739 align:middle line:84%
into any of the gospels
that were then handed down

00:49:54.739 --> 00:49:55.780 align:middle line:90%
into the Christian world.

00:49:55.780 --> 00:49:58.160 align:middle line:84%
That was a missing gospel
as a matter of fact.

00:49:58.160 --> 00:50:00.730 align:middle line:84%
Again, the refusal
to allow eastern

00:50:00.730 --> 00:50:03.952 align:middle line:84%
thought into that particular
document, the Bible.

00:50:03.952 --> 00:50:05.410 align:middle line:84%
>>DAVIDS: This
could be a good time

00:50:05.410 --> 00:50:08.550 align:middle line:90%
to get into the missing gospels.

00:50:08.550 --> 00:50:10.450 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Can I read
one statement here?

00:50:10.450 --> 00:50:14.580 align:middle line:84%
It's a biblical passage that has
left a lot of people scratching

00:50:14.580 --> 00:50:15.790 align:middle line:90%
their heads.

00:50:15.790 --> 00:50:18.440 align:middle line:84%
Now if you take eastern
thought into consideration

00:50:18.440 --> 00:50:19.740 align:middle line:90%
it makes perfect sense.

00:50:19.740 --> 00:50:21.230 align:middle line:90%
This is from Jesus.

00:50:21.230 --> 00:50:24.160 align:middle line:84%
Blessed is the one
who came into being

00:50:24.160 --> 00:50:26.570 align:middle line:90%
before he came into being.

00:50:26.570 --> 00:50:28.760 align:middle line:84%
>>DAVIDS: That's from
the Gospel of Thomas.

00:50:28.760 --> 00:50:30.884 align:middle line:84%
And Elaine Pagels of
Princeton University--

00:50:30.884 --> 00:50:31.800 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: I love that.

00:50:31.800 --> 00:50:33.675 align:middle line:84%
>>DAVIDS: --she talks
about that in the film.

00:50:33.675 --> 00:50:35.092 align:middle line:84%
It seems to suggest
reincarnation.

00:50:35.092 --> 00:50:36.258 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: It certainly does.

00:50:36.258 --> 00:50:37.820 align:middle line:84%
I mean that's just
one-- I just want

00:50:37.820 --> 00:50:39.611 align:middle line:84%
to throw one little
tidbit out before we go

00:50:39.611 --> 00:50:41.850 align:middle line:90%
into the other missing gospels.

00:50:41.850 --> 00:50:43.800 align:middle line:84%
>>DAVIDS: Yes, the
Gospel of Thomas

00:50:43.800 --> 00:50:46.150 align:middle line:90%
was found in India in a jar.

00:50:46.150 --> 00:50:51.202 align:middle line:84%
It was dug up by a Bedouin
who was digging for fertilizer

00:50:51.202 --> 00:50:52.160 align:middle line:90%
or something like that.

00:50:52.160 --> 00:50:56.330 align:middle line:84%
And lots of ancient Christian
manuscripts, gospels

00:50:56.330 --> 00:50:58.917 align:middle line:84%
were found there that
have been widely studied.

00:50:58.917 --> 00:51:01.250 align:middle line:84%
And these were ones that had
been rejected for inclusion

00:51:01.250 --> 00:51:02.208 align:middle line:90%
in the Christian Bible.

00:51:02.208 --> 00:51:03.090 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Of course.

00:51:03.090 --> 00:51:07.200 align:middle line:84%
>>DAVIDS: So the Gospel of
Thomas, which Elaine Pagels

00:51:07.200 --> 00:51:10.030 align:middle line:84%
speculates may in its
philosophy be closer

00:51:10.030 --> 00:51:11.880 align:middle line:84%
to the original
Christianity than some

00:51:11.880 --> 00:51:13.171 align:middle line:90%
of what's in the New Testament.

00:51:13.171 --> 00:51:16.700 align:middle line:90%


00:51:16.700 --> 00:51:18.530 align:middle line:84%
The kingdom of
heaven is within you.

00:51:18.530 --> 00:51:19.750 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Is within you,
that's the other one.

00:51:19.750 --> 00:51:20.800 align:middle line:90%
>>DAVIDS: It's a yogic idea.

00:51:20.800 --> 00:51:21.800 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Totally yogic.

00:51:21.800 --> 00:51:23.440 align:middle line:90%
>>DAVIDS: Go within, meditation.

00:51:23.440 --> 00:51:25.485 align:middle line:90%
You'll find the presence of God.

00:51:25.485 --> 00:51:27.860 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Don't be looking to
the outside for validation,

00:51:27.860 --> 00:51:29.300 align:middle line:90%
forgiveness, permission.

00:51:29.300 --> 00:51:30.700 align:middle line:90%
Go inside, you already know.

00:51:30.700 --> 00:51:33.030 align:middle line:84%
>>DAVIDS: Yes, and that you
can have your own contact

00:51:33.030 --> 00:51:33.620 align:middle line:90%
with divinity.

00:51:33.620 --> 00:51:35.745 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: But that whole
notion of self-empowerment

00:51:35.745 --> 00:51:39.020 align:middle line:84%
isn't really big in either the
Catholic or Protestant belief

00:51:39.020 --> 00:51:39.820 align:middle line:90%
systems.

00:51:39.820 --> 00:51:40.890 align:middle line:84%
>>DAVIDS: Are we
that short on time

00:51:40.890 --> 00:51:42.720 align:middle line:84%
because we haven't
talked about Yuz Asaf.

00:51:42.720 --> 00:51:43.690 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: We're going
to go-- actually

00:51:43.690 --> 00:51:46.135 align:middle line:84%
that's where I was going to go
instead of the missing gospel.

00:51:46.135 --> 00:51:46.560 align:middle line:90%
>>DAVIDS: Let's go there.

00:51:46.560 --> 00:51:47.800 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: OK, because
we go there instead.

00:51:47.800 --> 00:51:49.508 align:middle line:84%
Let's do that, because
I want to also get

00:51:49.508 --> 00:51:52.172 align:middle line:90%
that film clip from the bomb.

00:51:52.172 --> 00:51:53.880 align:middle line:84%
>>DAVIDS: From the
Muslims near the tomb.

00:51:53.880 --> 00:51:55.588 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: From the
Muslims near the tomb.

00:51:55.588 --> 00:51:58.210 align:middle line:84%
So first of all,
tell us what we're

00:51:58.210 --> 00:52:01.380 align:middle line:84%
going to be seeing and
tell us about that tomb.

00:52:01.380 --> 00:52:04.540 align:middle line:84%
And then we're going
to show the clip.

00:52:04.540 --> 00:52:08.040 align:middle line:84%
>>DAVIDS: Now this is the
most controversial part

00:52:08.040 --> 00:52:11.070 align:middle line:84%
of the Jesus in India
theory, that there

00:52:11.070 --> 00:52:13.935 align:middle line:84%
are some who take it way
beyond the 18 missing years

00:52:13.935 --> 00:52:17.310 align:middle line:84%
where we have all this evidence
I've been talking about.

00:52:17.310 --> 00:52:20.450 align:middle line:84%
And they offer the
theory that Jesus,

00:52:20.450 --> 00:52:24.180 align:middle line:84%
like the Muslims believe,
did not die on the cross.

00:52:24.180 --> 00:52:26.650 align:middle line:84%
Whether it's because
they didn't quite

00:52:26.650 --> 00:52:28.800 align:middle line:84%
finish the execution before
they brought him down

00:52:28.800 --> 00:52:31.650 align:middle line:90%
and ministered to help.

00:52:31.650 --> 00:52:33.300 align:middle line:84%
I mean it's a different
way of looking

00:52:33.300 --> 00:52:36.910 align:middle line:84%
at it than the miraculous way
that there was a resurrection.

00:52:36.910 --> 00:52:40.000 align:middle line:84%
So it contradicts with
Orthodox Christianity.

00:52:40.000 --> 00:52:44.220 align:middle line:84%
And no one here is saying
that this is true, but it's--

00:52:44.220 --> 00:52:46.329 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Just talking
about one of the theories

00:52:46.329 --> 00:52:47.370 align:middle line:90%
and what's devoted to it.

00:52:47.370 --> 00:52:50.740 align:middle line:84%
>>DAVIDS: --interesting
that in Kashmir there

00:52:50.740 --> 00:52:54.090 align:middle line:90%
is a tomb of Yuz Asaf.

00:52:54.090 --> 00:52:56.530 align:middle line:90%
It sounds like Jesus in a way.

00:52:56.530 --> 00:53:02.760 align:middle line:84%
They say it's either Jesus the
gatherer or Jesus the healer.

00:53:02.760 --> 00:53:06.790 align:middle line:84%
And we went to Kashmir in
search of what evidence there

00:53:06.790 --> 00:53:07.620 align:middle line:90%
might be.

00:53:07.620 --> 00:53:10.700 align:middle line:84%
There are those who think
it's the tomb of Christ.

00:53:10.700 --> 00:53:13.250 align:middle line:84%
But I want to say
before I go there

00:53:13.250 --> 00:53:23.050 align:middle line:84%
that James Cameron, the great
director and Simcha Jacobovici

00:53:23.050 --> 00:53:25.530 align:middle line:84%
have done a wonderful
documentary on the tomb

00:53:25.530 --> 00:53:28.330 align:middle line:84%
of Jesus claiming
a tomb of Jesus

00:53:28.330 --> 00:53:31.520 align:middle line:84%
and his family has actually
been found in Israel.

00:53:31.520 --> 00:53:35.030 align:middle line:84%
Certainly both
stories can't be true,

00:53:35.030 --> 00:53:38.150 align:middle line:84%
and I don't know which one
has the stronger element.

00:53:38.150 --> 00:53:42.090 align:middle line:90%
But the Kashmir tomb we think--

00:53:42.090 --> 00:53:44.660 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Well, let's bring
up politics for a moment.

00:53:44.660 --> 00:53:50.060 align:middle line:84%
He had already alienated
himself from the people,

00:53:50.060 --> 00:53:52.770 align:middle line:84%
from both as you
say both the church

00:53:52.770 --> 00:53:57.280 align:middle line:84%
and from the Hebrew community
at the time of his death

00:53:57.280 --> 00:53:58.410 align:middle line:90%
or crucifixion.

00:53:58.410 --> 00:54:02.470 align:middle line:84%
So as you stated in the film,
it would've been very consistent

00:54:02.470 --> 00:54:05.510 align:middle line:84%
in his character for him to
say I'm out of here if you did

00:54:05.510 --> 00:54:08.920 align:middle line:84%
survive it, to move on and
perhaps back two fields

00:54:08.920 --> 00:54:10.860 align:middle line:84%
that were a little
more receptive.

00:54:10.860 --> 00:54:13.210 align:middle line:84%
So it's possible if he did
live he would have moved on.

00:54:13.210 --> 00:54:15.340 align:middle line:84%
He could have gone right
back to India or Kashmir.

00:54:15.340 --> 00:54:16.548 align:middle line:90%
>>DAVIDS: To return to India.

00:54:16.548 --> 00:54:18.490 align:middle line:90%
He was a wanted man in Israel.

00:54:18.490 --> 00:54:23.930 align:middle line:84%
And on the way where was it
that he was physically seen

00:54:23.930 --> 00:54:25.370 align:middle line:90%
by Saint Paul?

00:54:25.370 --> 00:54:26.995 align:middle line:90%
On the road to Damascus.

00:54:26.995 --> 00:54:28.200 align:middle line:90%
That's Syria.

00:54:28.200 --> 00:54:31.156 align:middle line:90%
That's the way out of town.

00:54:31.156 --> 00:54:33.030 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So now let's
go, now let's go ahead

00:54:33.030 --> 00:54:34.700 align:middle line:90%
and set up this tomb.

00:54:34.700 --> 00:54:37.240 align:middle line:84%
Once again before we
go to the comments

00:54:37.240 --> 00:54:42.770 align:middle line:84%
by the local Muslim hierarchy
that exists there today.

00:54:42.770 --> 00:54:45.410 align:middle line:84%
>>DAVIDS: Well, Ed Martin
had discovered a book written

00:54:45.410 --> 00:54:48.290 align:middle line:84%
by someone from Kashmir
whose name is Aziz Kashmiri,

00:54:48.290 --> 00:54:51.080 align:middle line:84%
and it's called
"Jesus in Kashmir."

00:54:51.080 --> 00:54:53.760 align:middle line:84%
This is what shocked
him because he

00:54:53.760 --> 00:54:55.850 align:middle line:84%
had been urged he had
to go to Kashmir if he

00:54:55.850 --> 00:54:56.840 align:middle line:90%
was going to India.

00:54:56.840 --> 00:54:58.800 align:middle line:84%
And he felt that
meeting Aziz Kashmiri

00:54:58.800 --> 00:55:00.575 align:middle line:90%
was the whole purpose of that.

00:55:00.575 --> 00:55:02.950 align:middle line:84%
That it was almost ordained
that he had to follow through

00:55:02.950 --> 00:55:04.890 align:middle line:90%
on that part of the mission.

00:55:04.890 --> 00:55:07.500 align:middle line:84%
Aziz Kashmiri's book gives
all the arguments why

00:55:07.500 --> 00:55:09.120 align:middle line:90%
the tomb of Yuz Asaf.

00:55:09.120 --> 00:55:11.905 align:middle line:90%
is the tomb of Christ.

00:55:11.905 --> 00:55:15.760 align:middle line:90%


00:55:15.760 --> 00:55:18.660 align:middle line:84%
The tomb itself is in
the east west direction,

00:55:18.660 --> 00:55:20.695 align:middle line:90%
which was a Jewish tradition.

00:55:20.695 --> 00:55:23.020 align:middle line:90%
The Hindus cremated their dead.

00:55:23.020 --> 00:55:27.190 align:middle line:90%
So this was prior to Islam.

00:55:27.190 --> 00:55:29.540 align:middle line:90%
It's an older tomb than that.

00:55:29.540 --> 00:55:33.120 align:middle line:84%
And there's a Temple
of Solomon in Kashmir,

00:55:33.120 --> 00:55:36.044 align:middle line:84%
which is a duplication
of the smaller

00:55:36.044 --> 00:55:37.335 align:middle line:90%
version of the original temple.

00:55:37.335 --> 00:55:40.190 align:middle line:84%
And there was inscription
on there going back

00:55:40.190 --> 00:55:44.360 align:middle line:84%
to the time of Yuz Asaf in
Kashmir declaring himself

00:55:44.360 --> 00:55:48.060 align:middle line:84%
a prophet of the
children of Israel.

00:55:48.060 --> 00:55:50.210 align:middle line:90%
That is compelling.

00:55:50.210 --> 00:55:51.010 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: It is.

00:55:51.010 --> 00:55:52.380 align:middle line:84%
>>DAVIDS: Now I know
Catholics who say,

00:55:52.380 --> 00:55:54.090 align:middle line:84%
look it didn't have
to be Christ himself.

00:55:54.090 --> 00:55:55.555 align:middle line:84%
It could've been one
of Christ's followers.

00:55:55.555 --> 00:55:56.940 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: It could have
been a different one, yes.

00:55:56.940 --> 00:55:59.640 align:middle line:84%
>>DAVIDS: Someone in his name,
someone preaching the gospel.

00:55:59.640 --> 00:56:01.290 align:middle line:90%
Jesus sent out many.

00:56:01.290 --> 00:56:04.550 align:middle line:84%
So we don't want
to say that this

00:56:04.550 --> 00:56:06.720 align:middle line:84%
is a-- but it's
interesting there

00:56:06.720 --> 00:56:09.430 align:middle line:84%
is the belief of many in
that part of the world that's

00:56:09.430 --> 00:56:10.230 align:middle line:90%
his tomb.

00:56:10.230 --> 00:56:13.940 align:middle line:84%
It's the belief of
the Ahmadiyya Muslims.

00:56:13.940 --> 00:56:15.930 align:middle line:84%
They experienced
prejudice against them

00:56:15.930 --> 00:56:19.300 align:middle line:84%
from all the other
branches of Islam.

00:56:19.300 --> 00:56:23.120 align:middle line:90%
They are punished.

00:56:23.120 --> 00:56:24.790 align:middle line:90%
They are sometimes murdered.

00:56:24.790 --> 00:56:26.880 align:middle line:84%
They're not allowed to
have pilgrimage to Mecca.

00:56:26.880 --> 00:56:27.110 align:middle line:90%
They have to convert.

00:56:27.110 --> 00:56:28.640 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Well, because there
are very strong feelings

00:56:28.640 --> 00:56:29.480 align:middle line:90%
about this.

00:56:29.480 --> 00:56:30.842 align:middle line:90%
Let's go to the clip of film.

00:56:30.842 --> 00:56:32.800 align:middle line:84%
>>DAVIDS: Of what the
Muslim said at the tomb--

00:56:32.800 --> 00:56:34.640 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: What they
said at the tomb itself.

00:56:34.640 --> 00:56:35.630 align:middle line:90%
Let's just take a look.

00:56:35.630 --> 00:56:36.430 align:middle line:90%
This is vehement.

00:56:36.430 --> 00:56:37.470 align:middle line:90%
>>DAVIDS: It was heated.

00:56:37.470 --> 00:56:38.270 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Heated.

00:56:38.270 --> 00:57:13.770 align:middle line:90%


00:57:13.770 --> 00:57:18.080 align:middle line:84%
Yeah so we can see we've
got a lot of bridge building

00:57:18.080 --> 00:57:20.170 align:middle line:90%
to still build here.

00:57:20.170 --> 00:57:23.140 align:middle line:10%
And one of the things that
was of interest on that tomb

00:57:23.140 --> 00:57:26.060 align:middle line:10%
too was the carvings
of the individual

00:57:26.060 --> 00:57:28.370 align:middle line:10%
where they showed the feet
of the person entombed--

00:57:28.370 --> 00:57:29.786 align:middle line:10%
>>DAVIDS: The feet
of the prophet.

00:57:29.786 --> 00:57:32.470 align:middle line:10%
>>REGINA: --which had holes
in it from what appear to be

00:57:32.470 --> 00:57:33.949 align:middle line:10%
crucifixion of some--

00:57:33.949 --> 00:57:35.490 align:middle line:10%
>>DAVIDS: Indicating
the crucifixion.

00:57:35.490 --> 00:57:37.245 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: And how old is that?

00:57:37.245 --> 00:57:38.620 align:middle line:84%
>>DAVIDS: Honestly
we don't know.

00:57:38.620 --> 00:57:39.140 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Does anyone know?

00:57:39.140 --> 00:57:40.240 align:middle line:90%
>>DAVIDS: We don't know.

00:57:40.240 --> 00:57:42.449 align:middle line:84%
But now the Muslims near
there they cover it up.

00:57:42.449 --> 00:57:44.990 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Right, they keep it
shuttered so no one can see it.

00:57:44.990 --> 00:57:45.552 align:middle line:84%
>>DAVIDS: As a
matter of fact, they

00:57:45.552 --> 00:57:47.740 align:middle line:84%
got the government to
lock up the whole tomb,

00:57:47.740 --> 00:57:48.854 align:middle line:90%
so no one is allowed in.

00:57:48.854 --> 00:57:51.020 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So obviously
they're protecting something.

00:57:51.020 --> 00:57:53.530 align:middle line:84%
>>DAVIDS: It happened
because author Suzanne

00:57:53.530 --> 00:57:56.920 align:middle line:84%
Olson got permission
to go in there

00:57:56.920 --> 00:57:58.280 align:middle line:90%
and try and get a DNA sample.

00:57:58.280 --> 00:58:00.240 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Right, right
she was a brave woman.

00:58:00.240 --> 00:58:02.019 align:middle line:84%
>>DAVIDS: And then
people got up in arms.

00:58:02.019 --> 00:58:03.310 align:middle line:90%
They didn't allow it to happen.

00:58:03.310 --> 00:58:04.440 align:middle line:90%
They locked up the tomb.

00:58:04.440 --> 00:58:08.290 align:middle line:84%
We weren't even allowed
to go in there to film.

00:58:08.290 --> 00:58:09.150 align:middle line:90%
We managed it.

00:58:09.150 --> 00:58:10.290 align:middle line:90%
Somehow we managed it.

00:58:10.290 --> 00:58:13.210 align:middle line:84%
And when the police
showed up and my crew

00:58:13.210 --> 00:58:17.530 align:middle line:84%
was nearly arrested, it was
only thanks to a soccer game

00:58:17.530 --> 00:58:19.130 align:middle line:84%
that they weren't
taken off to prison.

00:58:19.130 --> 00:58:21.420 align:middle line:84%
Because the policeman,
it turns out

00:58:21.420 --> 00:58:23.710 align:middle line:84%
had a son who was playing
in a soccer match in India.

00:58:23.710 --> 00:58:27.160 align:middle line:84%
That was the same soccer match
that my Indian producer--

00:58:27.160 --> 00:58:29.937 align:middle line:84%
so they talked soccer
instead of legalities.

00:58:29.937 --> 00:58:30.770 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Jail time.

00:58:30.770 --> 00:58:31.390 align:middle line:90%
>>DAVIDS: Yes, yes.

00:58:31.390 --> 00:58:32.370 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Thank God.

00:58:32.370 --> 00:58:33.411 align:middle line:90%
>>DAVIDS: It was amazing.

00:58:33.411 --> 00:58:36.500 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Well, now we're out
of time I'm afraid to say.

00:58:36.500 --> 00:58:38.640 align:middle line:84%
But almost I just
think that before we

00:58:38.640 --> 00:58:43.760 align:middle line:84%
go the whole point is Ed wanted
to find for himself if there

00:58:43.760 --> 00:58:46.490 align:middle line:84%
was some kind of bridge that
bridged all of this together

00:58:46.490 --> 00:58:49.400 align:middle line:84%
and made these stories he'd
been hearing about true.

00:58:49.400 --> 00:58:51.140 align:middle line:84%
You didn't get your
hands on the document

00:58:51.140 --> 00:58:53.550 align:middle line:84%
but you got a lot of
evidence along the way.

00:58:53.550 --> 00:58:56.770 align:middle line:84%
And I think it's appropriate
to end this with the statement

00:58:56.770 --> 00:58:58.900 align:middle line:90%
from the Dalai Lama.

00:58:58.900 --> 00:59:01.580 align:middle line:10%
>>DAVIDS: Well,
before the Dalai Lama

00:59:01.580 --> 00:59:04.990 align:middle line:10%
speaks I want to say what Ed
said is is the old saying where

00:59:04.990 --> 00:59:06.342 align:middle line:10%
there's smoke there's fire.

00:59:06.342 --> 00:59:07.300 align:middle line:10%
>>REGINA: That's right.

00:59:07.300 --> 00:59:09.633 align:middle line:10%
>>DAVIDS: And he may not have
put his hands in the fire,

00:59:09.633 --> 00:59:11.090 align:middle line:10%
but he saw a lot of smoke.

00:59:11.090 --> 00:59:12.750 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: A lot
of smoke, exactly.

00:59:12.750 --> 00:59:15.010 align:middle line:84%
>>DAVIDS: We were able to
get to the Dalai Lama, who

00:59:15.010 --> 00:59:18.730 align:middle line:84%
in a letter to me actually
denied that he had

00:59:18.730 --> 00:59:21.140 align:middle line:90%
seen that document in Tibet.

00:59:21.140 --> 00:59:25.080 align:middle line:84%
It may have been something
done of official necessity,

00:59:25.080 --> 00:59:28.180 align:middle line:84%
but he had the courtesy to
respond to me from his office

00:59:28.180 --> 00:59:29.630 align:middle line:90%
to my question.

00:59:29.630 --> 00:59:32.600 align:middle line:84%
And he had the
courtesy to allow us

00:59:32.600 --> 00:59:36.520 align:middle line:84%
to let him sort of give the
wrap up to this whole story

00:59:36.520 --> 00:59:37.670 align:middle line:90%
about Jesus in India.

00:59:37.670 --> 00:59:40.602 align:middle line:84%
That tells us something
and he's wonderful.

00:59:40.602 --> 00:59:42.400 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Yes, and
on that note, I

00:59:42.400 --> 00:59:46.166 align:middle line:84%
want to thank you so much
for your participation in it,

00:59:46.166 --> 00:59:47.540 align:middle line:84%
for coming and
sharing the story.

00:59:47.540 --> 00:59:48.860 align:middle line:90%
You're a wonderful storyteller.

00:59:48.860 --> 00:59:51.270 align:middle line:84%
And there's some-- just it's
a beautiful film, a really

00:59:51.270 --> 00:59:54.870 align:middle line:84%
beautiful film and a
very wonderful endeavor

00:59:54.870 --> 00:59:56.470 align:middle line:90%
on the part of Edward.

00:59:56.470 --> 00:59:58.770 align:middle line:84%
So I want to thank
you, him via you

00:59:58.770 --> 01:00:00.060 align:middle line:90%
as well if you talk to him OK.
