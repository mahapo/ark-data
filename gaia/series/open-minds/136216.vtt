[THEME MUSIC]

00:00:08.266 --> 00:00:27.370 align:middle line:90%


00:00:27.370 --> 00:00:29.870 align:middle line:10%
>> REGINA MEREDITH: Many of us
remember when the first young

00:00:29.870 --> 00:00:33.050 align:middle line:10%
people began appearing in
airports in their orange robes,

00:00:33.050 --> 00:00:35.360 align:middle line:10%
blissed out, chanting
Hare Krishna.

00:00:35.360 --> 00:00:36.980 align:middle line:84%
It was the first
such public witness

00:00:36.980 --> 00:00:40.340 align:middle line:84%
of religious practices of
the East for many Americans,

00:00:40.340 --> 00:00:42.080 align:middle line:90%
and it looked strange to us.

00:00:42.080 --> 00:00:44.210 align:middle line:84%
Joshua Greene was
one such devotee

00:00:44.210 --> 00:00:46.640 align:middle line:84%
of a man with a
remarkable life story.

00:00:46.640 --> 00:00:48.650 align:middle line:90%
Swami "Prabhubadha."

00:00:48.650 --> 00:00:51.120 align:middle line:84%
And it's actually-- I know
I've mispronounced it already.

00:00:51.120 --> 00:00:52.500 align:middle line:90%
I think it's Prabhupada.

00:00:52.500 --> 00:00:54.500 align:middle line:84%
But give us his whole
name, because I don't dare

00:00:54.500 --> 00:00:55.610 align:middle line:90%
do that on camera.

00:00:55.610 --> 00:00:55.760 align:middle line:90%
>> JOSHUA GREENE: OK.

00:00:55.760 --> 00:00:56.927 align:middle line:90%
The official honorific name.

00:00:56.927 --> 00:00:57.726 align:middle line:10%
>> REGINA: Yes.

00:00:57.726 --> 00:00:59.060 align:middle line:10%
>> GREENE: His divine grace.

00:00:59.060 --> 00:00:59.860 align:middle line:10%
>> REGINA: Yes.

00:00:59.860 --> 00:01:04.714 align:middle line:84%
>> GREENE: A.C. Bhaktivedanta
Swami Prabhupada.

00:01:04.714 --> 00:01:05.630 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Prabhupada.

00:01:05.630 --> 00:01:06.260 align:middle line:90%
>> GREENE: Prabhupada.

00:01:06.260 --> 00:01:07.060 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: OK.

00:01:07.060 --> 00:01:10.700 align:middle line:84%
So thank you for
clarifying that.

00:01:10.700 --> 00:01:13.580 align:middle line:84%
And you know, I think to
start this conversation,

00:01:13.580 --> 00:01:18.620 align:middle line:84%
before we get into the
life story of Prabhupada,

00:01:18.620 --> 00:01:20.600 align:middle line:84%
I want to find out what
it was like for you

00:01:20.600 --> 00:01:23.960 align:middle line:84%
as a young devotee, because
I was doing the opposite.

00:01:23.960 --> 00:01:27.980 align:middle line:84%
I was on the airplane in my
20s, going to NBC in New York,

00:01:27.980 --> 00:01:30.830 align:middle line:84%
and hustling along,
and not very satisfied

00:01:30.830 --> 00:01:32.126 align:middle line:90%
with life on a lot of levels.

00:01:32.126 --> 00:01:33.500 align:middle line:84%
And you guys were
all blissed out

00:01:33.500 --> 00:01:37.150 align:middle line:84%
and I thought, who
are these guys.

00:01:37.150 --> 00:01:42.020 align:middle line:84%
And this was 1969 for you
when you started, and tell us

00:01:42.020 --> 00:01:44.420 align:middle line:84%
what prompted this
change in your life

00:01:44.420 --> 00:01:48.540 align:middle line:84%
and what it felt like
to be seen in this way

00:01:48.540 --> 00:01:52.540 align:middle line:84%
by all the strangers passing by,
or if this was even a thought.

00:01:52.540 --> 00:01:53.340 align:middle line:90%
>> GREENE: Sure.

00:01:53.340 --> 00:01:57.870 align:middle line:10%
What prompted it for me was,
I couldn't make the connection

00:01:57.870 --> 00:02:01.060 align:middle line:10%
between my studies at
the Sorbonne in Paris

00:02:01.060 --> 00:02:03.540 align:middle line:10%
in French literature
and the real world.

00:02:03.540 --> 00:02:05.430 align:middle line:84%
I didn't know what
Stendhal had to do

00:02:05.430 --> 00:02:08.160 align:middle line:84%
with me for love or
money, and was ready

00:02:08.160 --> 00:02:11.350 align:middle line:90%
for a change of some kind.

00:02:11.350 --> 00:02:13.870 align:middle line:84%
It's a question that can
be answered on many levels,

00:02:13.870 --> 00:02:17.700 align:middle line:84%
I think psychologically
also, as an only child

00:02:17.700 --> 00:02:21.630 align:middle line:84%
of a divorced mother
growing up at a time--

00:02:21.630 --> 00:02:24.240 align:middle line:84%
she was liberated
before it was chic,

00:02:24.240 --> 00:02:28.110 align:middle line:84%
so I grew up in a very
Jewish intellectual New York

00:02:28.110 --> 00:02:33.950 align:middle line:84%
environment, which meant being
open to pretty much anything.

00:02:33.950 --> 00:02:36.300 align:middle line:84%
There's another
dimension, which is--

00:02:36.300 --> 00:02:39.540 align:middle line:84%
you might call it the
mystery of the world, where

00:02:39.540 --> 00:02:42.990 align:middle line:90%
meeting a teacher is a gift.

00:02:42.990 --> 00:02:45.300 align:middle line:84%
You can't plot that
sociologically,

00:02:45.300 --> 00:02:47.640 align:middle line:84%
or historically,
or psychologically.

00:02:47.640 --> 00:02:51.180 align:middle line:84%
You can just be
appreciative for that.

00:02:51.180 --> 00:02:53.555 align:middle line:84%
What it was like
putting on robes--

00:02:53.555 --> 00:02:54.930 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: First,
where were you?

00:02:54.930 --> 00:02:55.730 align:middle line:90%
>> GREENE: Yeah.

00:02:55.730 --> 00:02:57.760 align:middle line:84%
I was in Paris and
then went to London.

00:02:57.760 --> 00:03:00.476 align:middle line:84%
Someone in Paris, an early
disciple of Prabhupada,

00:03:00.476 --> 00:03:02.100 align:middle line:84%
said, you know, you
should go to London

00:03:02.100 --> 00:03:06.600 align:middle line:84%
because the devotees are
recording records at Apple

00:03:06.600 --> 00:03:09.904 align:middle line:84%
studios with George Harrison,
and it's a great opportunity.

00:03:09.904 --> 00:03:10.704 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: What?

00:03:10.704 --> 00:03:11.181 align:middle line:90%
What?

00:03:11.181 --> 00:03:11.660 align:middle line:90%
>> GREENE: Ding.

00:03:11.660 --> 00:03:12.460 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:03:12.460 --> 00:03:15.510 align:middle line:84%
I mean, for any of your viewers
who were there at that time,

00:03:15.510 --> 00:03:19.380 align:middle line:84%
they know that the Beatles
back in the late '60s were it.

00:03:19.380 --> 00:03:21.210 align:middle line:84%
I mean, whatever
they were doing,

00:03:21.210 --> 00:03:23.670 align:middle line:84%
we wanted to know
what was going on.

00:03:23.670 --> 00:03:24.480 align:middle line:90%
So I did.

00:03:24.480 --> 00:03:25.530 align:middle line:90%
I went to London.

00:03:25.530 --> 00:03:28.029 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: And Prabhupada had
been staying with John Lennon?

00:03:28.029 --> 00:03:31.200 align:middle line:84%
>> GREENE: He had been staying
at John and Yoko's home.

00:03:31.200 --> 00:03:33.590 align:middle line:84%
Tittenhurst Park, I
think it was called.

00:03:33.590 --> 00:03:35.280 align:middle line:84%
And at one point,
they came to him

00:03:35.280 --> 00:03:37.110 align:middle line:84%
and said could he
arrange for them

00:03:37.110 --> 00:03:39.630 align:middle line:84%
to be reincarnated
together because they

00:03:39.630 --> 00:03:41.190 align:middle line:90%
loved each other so much.

00:03:41.190 --> 00:03:42.960 align:middle line:84%
Prabhupada smiled,
and shook his head,

00:03:42.960 --> 00:03:44.874 align:middle line:90%
and said that's not my business.

00:03:44.874 --> 00:03:46.080 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Right.

00:03:46.080 --> 00:03:50.890 align:middle line:84%
>> GREENE: So I showed up just
a couple of days after he had

00:03:50.890 --> 00:03:51.690 align:middle line:90%
left London.

00:03:51.690 --> 00:03:53.512 align:middle line:90%
So I missed seeing him.

00:03:53.512 --> 00:03:55.845 align:middle line:84%
So that's the first takeaway,
I think, for your viewers.

00:03:55.845 --> 00:03:56.015 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: OK.

00:03:56.015 --> 00:03:58.050 align:middle line:84%
Let's get into the
recording studio.

00:03:58.050 --> 00:03:58.850 align:middle line:90%
Why?

00:03:58.850 --> 00:04:00.580 align:middle line:84%
What was going on
with that at the time?

00:04:00.580 --> 00:04:05.640 align:middle line:84%
>> GREENE: George Harrison had
gotten very turned on by Bhakti

00:04:05.640 --> 00:04:07.410 align:middle line:90%
or devotional yoga.

00:04:07.410 --> 00:04:10.410 align:middle line:84%
He had gone to India in
'68 with Ravi Shankar.

00:04:10.410 --> 00:04:14.130 align:middle line:84%
Then, the following year, he
had been with the Beatles.

00:04:14.130 --> 00:04:16.320 align:middle line:90%
It was that same year. '68.

00:04:16.320 --> 00:04:19.500 align:middle line:84%
Let me get my dates straight.
'66 with Ravi Shankar

00:04:19.500 --> 00:04:21.829 align:middle line:90%
in Srinagar in Kashmir.

00:04:21.829 --> 00:04:25.770 align:middle line:84%
Then in '68, he took the other
Beatles to Maharishi's ashram

00:04:25.770 --> 00:04:27.390 align:middle line:90%
in Rishikesh.

00:04:27.390 --> 00:04:29.430 align:middle line:90%
They weren't into it.

00:04:29.430 --> 00:04:33.300 align:middle line:84%
George came back looking
for some spiritual company,

00:04:33.300 --> 00:04:36.510 align:middle line:84%
met my godbrothers
and godsisters

00:04:36.510 --> 00:04:39.630 align:middle line:84%
who were in London to
start a Krishna temple.

00:04:39.630 --> 00:04:45.030 align:middle line:84%
He got very turned on by the
Krishna view of spirituality

00:04:45.030 --> 00:04:48.880 align:middle line:84%
and decided he wanted
to give something back.

00:04:48.880 --> 00:04:53.465 align:middle line:84%
So he suggested, let's make a
recording of Sanskrit mantras.

00:04:53.465 --> 00:04:55.590 align:middle line:84%
And of course, the business
people at Apple studios

00:04:55.590 --> 00:04:58.920 align:middle line:84%
had no idea what's going to
come of this Sanskrit thing

00:04:58.920 --> 00:05:02.580 align:middle line:90%
with the Ringo Starr drumbeat.

00:05:02.580 --> 00:05:04.650 align:middle line:84%
So that's when I showed
up is when George

00:05:04.650 --> 00:05:06.909 align:middle line:90%
was recording those records.

00:05:06.909 --> 00:05:09.450 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: So you had a chance
to brush with him a little bit

00:05:09.450 --> 00:05:10.110 align:middle line:90%
too.

00:05:10.110 --> 00:05:10.910 align:middle line:90%
>> GREENE: Yeah.

00:05:10.910 --> 00:05:14.070 align:middle line:84%
That was an important
influence for me.

00:05:14.070 --> 00:05:18.360 align:middle line:84%
I mean, imagine being
19 years old in 1969

00:05:18.360 --> 00:05:20.160 align:middle line:84%
and getting to hang
out with George

00:05:20.160 --> 00:05:22.890 align:middle line:90%
Harrison and his friends.

00:05:22.890 --> 00:05:26.120 align:middle line:84%
So I'm thinking to myself as I'm
sitting there playing harmonium

00:05:26.120 --> 00:05:30.080 align:middle line:84%
in this EMI
recording studio, OK.

00:05:30.080 --> 00:05:35.280 align:middle line:84%
If I stay with these people,
I get god and the Beatles.

00:05:35.280 --> 00:05:36.080 align:middle line:90%
OK, I'm in.

00:05:36.080 --> 00:05:36.968 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Let's see.

00:05:36.968 --> 00:05:39.530 align:middle line:84%
I could go back to school
and study philosophy or--

00:05:39.530 --> 00:05:40.330 align:middle line:90%
>> GREENE: Right.

00:05:40.330 --> 00:05:41.290 align:middle line:90%
Or I can be here.

00:05:41.290 --> 00:05:43.575 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: And so, just
as a tiny little aside,

00:05:43.575 --> 00:05:46.460 align:middle line:84%
a divergence for a moment, how
did you find George Harrison

00:05:46.460 --> 00:05:48.939 align:middle line:90%
to be as a human being?

00:05:48.939 --> 00:05:51.230 align:middle line:84%
>> GREENE: As long as you
approached him and spoke with

00:05:51.230 --> 00:05:54.230 align:middle line:84%
him as a human being,
he was there for you.

00:05:54.230 --> 00:05:57.890 align:middle line:84%
He was warm, he was friendly,
he was interested in you.

00:05:57.890 --> 00:06:02.040 align:middle line:84%
You couldn't hope for a more
engaging conversationalist.

00:06:02.040 --> 00:06:02.840 align:middle line:90%
He was funny.

00:06:02.840 --> 00:06:04.090 align:middle line:90%
He had a great sense of humor.

00:06:04.090 --> 00:06:05.090 align:middle line:90%
Very energetic guy.

00:06:05.090 --> 00:06:08.690 align:middle line:84%
He would sometimes bounce
back and foot from one foot

00:06:08.690 --> 00:06:11.630 align:middle line:84%
to the other, because he was
just so excited about life.

00:06:11.630 --> 00:06:15.530 align:middle line:84%
If you looked at him with
that little glint in your eye

00:06:15.530 --> 00:06:19.070 align:middle line:84%
like, oh, I'm with a Beatle now,
he would walk the other way.

00:06:19.070 --> 00:06:24.500 align:middle line:84%
He did not want to reinforce
that Maya illusory material

00:06:24.500 --> 00:06:28.310 align:middle line:84%
identity for anyone,
including himself, anymore.

00:06:28.310 --> 00:06:29.660 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Interesting.

00:06:29.660 --> 00:06:30.460 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:06:30.460 --> 00:06:32.390 align:middle line:90%
So anyway, we'll get--

00:06:32.390 --> 00:06:35.480 align:middle line:84%
in the story, as we progress
through Swami's life,

00:06:35.480 --> 00:06:37.340 align:middle line:84%
we'll get to that
part of the story

00:06:37.340 --> 00:06:39.530 align:middle line:84%
and other expressions
of it, artistically,

00:06:39.530 --> 00:06:41.690 align:middle line:84%
and how he just kind
of blew up, literally,

00:06:41.690 --> 00:06:43.250 align:middle line:90%
in America in a good way.

00:06:43.250 --> 00:06:44.150 align:middle line:90%
But OK.

00:06:44.150 --> 00:06:48.230 align:middle line:84%
So let's start now with,
once you put the robes on.

00:06:48.230 --> 00:06:50.242 align:middle line:84%
Now, let's get to
your story first.

00:06:50.242 --> 00:06:51.950 align:middle line:84%
Where did you start
putting the robes on,

00:06:51.950 --> 00:06:55.250 align:middle line:84%
and you were one of
the people in the park.

00:06:55.250 --> 00:06:59.180 align:middle line:84%
>> GREENE: In London, when
I first visited the Krishna

00:06:59.180 --> 00:07:05.330 align:middle line:84%
temple there in December of
'69, this was still bell bottoms

00:07:05.330 --> 00:07:08.690 align:middle line:90%
and, you know, that whole scene.

00:07:08.690 --> 00:07:11.840 align:middle line:84%
So in a sense, putting on
robes, and painting yourself,

00:07:11.840 --> 00:07:13.820 align:middle line:84%
and wearing beads wasn't
all that big a change.

00:07:13.820 --> 00:07:14.660 align:middle line:90%
We were doing that anyway.

00:07:14.660 --> 00:07:15.470 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: Because we had long
hair and we were wearing beads

00:07:15.470 --> 00:07:16.270 align:middle line:90%
anyway.

00:07:16.270 --> 00:07:18.690 align:middle line:90%


00:07:18.690 --> 00:07:21.200 align:middle line:84%
>> GREENE: But it
was a psychic shift.

00:07:21.200 --> 00:07:24.830 align:middle line:84%
I mean, French
sociologist Emile Durkheim

00:07:24.830 --> 00:07:26.309 align:middle line:90%
would describe it as anomie.

00:07:26.309 --> 00:07:27.350 align:middle line:90%
It's an interesting word.

00:07:27.350 --> 00:07:29.570 align:middle line:90%
"A-N-O-M-I-E."

00:07:29.570 --> 00:07:33.380 align:middle line:84%
When you're in the normal
world, the everyday world,

00:07:33.380 --> 00:07:35.455 align:middle line:84%
the common world, you
know what the rules are.

00:07:35.455 --> 00:07:37.080 align:middle line:84%
You know how you're
supposed to behave.

00:07:37.080 --> 00:07:38.788 align:middle line:84%
You know how people
are going to respond,

00:07:38.788 --> 00:07:43.190 align:middle line:84%
how do you respond to them,
how to talk, what to do.

00:07:43.190 --> 00:07:46.250 align:middle line:84%
If you're brought
out of that world

00:07:46.250 --> 00:07:49.760 align:middle line:84%
into a new place where you
don't know the rules anymore,

00:07:49.760 --> 00:07:52.070 align:middle line:84%
that awkward sense
of displacement,

00:07:52.070 --> 00:07:57.500 align:middle line:84%
of not knowing how to behave,
Durkheim called anomie.

00:07:57.500 --> 00:08:03.860 align:middle line:84%
There was some anomie
going into devotional life.

00:08:03.860 --> 00:08:07.970 align:middle line:84%
How I decided to do it is
still a bit of a mystery to me.

00:08:07.970 --> 00:08:10.310 align:middle line:84%
You know, I think it
was experimenting,

00:08:10.310 --> 00:08:13.170 align:middle line:84%
as we were doing in those days
anyway, in all kinds of ways.

00:08:13.170 --> 00:08:15.410 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Sure.

00:08:15.410 --> 00:08:19.640 align:middle line:84%
>> GREENE: As best I've
been able to figure it out,

00:08:19.640 --> 00:08:21.380 align:middle line:90%
I liked the people.

00:08:21.380 --> 00:08:23.030 align:middle line:90%
They were smart.

00:08:23.030 --> 00:08:25.190 align:middle line:90%
They were funny.

00:08:25.190 --> 00:08:29.300 align:middle line:84%
I didn't really understand the
Bhagavad-Gita or the imagery

00:08:29.300 --> 00:08:30.290 align:middle line:90%
and the iconography.

00:08:30.290 --> 00:08:31.940 align:middle line:90%
That was all kind of foreign.

00:08:31.940 --> 00:08:35.960 align:middle line:84%
But those people, I
wanted in my life.

00:08:35.960 --> 00:08:39.919 align:middle line:84%
I mean, in Christianity, it
would be called fellowship.

00:08:39.919 --> 00:08:43.280 align:middle line:84%
In Sanskrit and ashrams,
it's called sangha.

00:08:43.280 --> 00:08:48.524 align:middle line:84%
The most important component of
spiritual life is good company.

00:08:48.524 --> 00:08:50.690 align:middle line:84%
If you don't have that, all
the mantras in the world

00:08:50.690 --> 00:08:52.430 align:middle line:84%
aren't going to do you any
good because you're going

00:08:52.430 --> 00:08:53.720 align:middle line:90%
to stop at a certain point.

00:08:53.720 --> 00:08:54.770 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Very true.

00:08:54.770 --> 00:08:57.350 align:middle line:84%
>> GREENE: Having good
friends, smart people,

00:08:57.350 --> 00:09:02.330 align:middle line:84%
fellow journeyers on the path
is the greatest resource.

00:09:02.330 --> 00:09:04.850 align:middle line:84%
So they were doing
it and I said, OK.

00:09:04.850 --> 00:09:07.190 align:middle line:90%
It's worth an experiment.

00:09:07.190 --> 00:09:11.280 align:middle line:84%
So I put on the robes, I put
on the tilak, as it's called,

00:09:11.280 --> 00:09:15.050 align:middle line:84%
which is Ganges
clay on the face.

00:09:15.050 --> 00:09:16.790 align:middle line:90%
Neck beads.

00:09:16.790 --> 00:09:19.610 align:middle line:84%
And we went out on
Oxford Street in London

00:09:19.610 --> 00:09:22.520 align:middle line:84%
with the drums and
the hand symbols

00:09:22.520 --> 00:09:24.210 align:middle line:90%
chanting (SINGING) Hare Krishna.

00:09:24.210 --> 00:09:25.310 align:middle line:90%
Hare Krishna.

00:09:25.310 --> 00:09:28.310 align:middle line:90%
Krishna Krishna Hare Hare.

00:09:28.310 --> 00:09:31.740 align:middle line:84%
(SPEAKING) And I was
shaking in my boots.

00:09:31.740 --> 00:09:33.719 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: I bet.

00:09:33.719 --> 00:09:34.760 align:middle line:90%
Especially Oxford Street.

00:09:34.760 --> 00:09:35.960 align:middle line:84%
>> GREENE: I was saying
what the heck is this.

00:09:35.960 --> 00:09:36.760 align:middle line:90%
You know?

00:09:36.760 --> 00:09:38.450 align:middle line:90%
How did I get here?

00:09:38.450 --> 00:09:43.610 align:middle line:84%
And you want to know how
macabre God's sense of humor is?

00:09:43.610 --> 00:09:45.680 align:middle line:84%
The first day I
went out chanting

00:09:45.680 --> 00:09:49.470 align:middle line:84%
on Oxford Street, my old
girlfriend from college--

00:09:49.470 --> 00:09:50.270 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Oh god.

00:09:50.270 --> 00:09:51.900 align:middle line:84%
>> GREENE: Is walking
down the street.

00:09:51.900 --> 00:09:58.360 align:middle line:84%
She's visiting London and
I'm going oh my Krishna.

00:09:58.360 --> 00:10:00.236 align:middle line:90%
What is this?

00:10:00.236 --> 00:10:02.860 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: This is like-- those
are those moments I was talking

00:10:02.860 --> 00:10:03.180 align:middle line:90%
about.

00:10:03.180 --> 00:10:05.138 align:middle line:84%
>> GREENE: I'm getting
chills just remembering.

00:10:05.138 --> 00:10:06.600 align:middle line:84%
And she looked at
me and she froze.

00:10:06.600 --> 00:10:07.400 align:middle line:90%
Literally.

00:10:07.400 --> 00:10:10.790 align:middle line:84%
I'd never seen anyone
freeze quite as dramatically

00:10:10.790 --> 00:10:11.840 align:middle line:90%
as she froze.

00:10:11.840 --> 00:10:14.930 align:middle line:84%
And her eyes just
kind of bugged out,

00:10:14.930 --> 00:10:16.890 align:middle line:90%
and I didn't know what to do.

00:10:16.890 --> 00:10:17.690 align:middle line:90%
That's anomie.

00:10:17.690 --> 00:10:18.731 align:middle line:90%
I didn't know what to do.

00:10:18.731 --> 00:10:24.830 align:middle line:84%
I didn't know how to
respond to her sense

00:10:24.830 --> 00:10:27.020 align:middle line:84%
of maybe being afraid,
of not quite knowing

00:10:27.020 --> 00:10:29.510 align:middle line:90%
what is she seeing here.

00:10:29.510 --> 00:10:31.520 align:middle line:90%
I wish I had done better.

00:10:31.520 --> 00:10:33.140 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: What did you do?

00:10:33.140 --> 00:10:35.509 align:middle line:84%
>> GREENE: I smiled
and I kept walking.

00:10:35.509 --> 00:10:37.050 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: Oh, you
didn't engage her.

00:10:37.050 --> 00:10:37.500 align:middle line:90%
>> GREENE: I didn't.

00:10:37.500 --> 00:10:38.555 align:middle line:90%
I didn't know what to say.

00:10:38.555 --> 00:10:39.720 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: And
she didn't either.

00:10:39.720 --> 00:10:40.520 align:middle line:90%
>> GREENE: No.

00:10:40.520 --> 00:10:46.410 align:middle line:84%
No, it was-- well,
it made me question,

00:10:46.410 --> 00:10:48.430 align:middle line:84%
is this really
what I want to do.

00:10:48.430 --> 00:10:49.230 align:middle line:90%
You know.

00:10:49.230 --> 00:10:49.600 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Right.

00:10:49.600 --> 00:10:51.450 align:middle line:84%
You had to make-- this
was a big choice point,

00:10:51.450 --> 00:10:51.980 align:middle line:90%
and it was immediate.

00:10:51.980 --> 00:10:52.180 align:middle line:90%
>> GREENE: Yeah.

00:10:52.180 --> 00:10:53.130 align:middle line:84%
That was a big
moment right there.

00:10:53.130 --> 00:10:54.570 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: Immediate
choice point.

00:10:54.570 --> 00:10:55.920 align:middle line:90%
First time you put the robes on.

00:10:55.920 --> 00:11:00.582 align:middle line:84%
>> GREENE: And maybe the
takeaway there for people is,

00:11:00.582 --> 00:11:05.340 align:middle line:84%
as Joe Campbell describes
in the Monomyth Model,

00:11:05.340 --> 00:11:08.340 align:middle line:84%
sooner or later, whether
it's by choice or by force

00:11:08.340 --> 00:11:10.680 align:middle line:84%
of circumstance,
you will confront--

00:11:10.680 --> 00:11:12.750 align:middle line:90%
every one of us will confront--

00:11:12.750 --> 00:11:16.940 align:middle line:84%
that moment of a
call to adventure

00:11:16.940 --> 00:11:20.400 align:middle line:84%
is what Campbell
describes it, where

00:11:20.400 --> 00:11:23.040 align:middle line:84%
you're forced out of
the everyday world

00:11:23.040 --> 00:11:24.810 align:middle line:90%
and you're on this trial--

00:11:24.810 --> 00:11:27.690 align:middle line:84%
on this trail, rather,
where there are

00:11:27.690 --> 00:11:30.759 align:middle line:90%
trials, and confronting them.

00:11:30.759 --> 00:11:32.550 align:middle line:84%
I think that might have
been my first trial

00:11:32.550 --> 00:11:34.224 align:middle line:90%
was seeing my old girlfriend.

00:11:34.224 --> 00:11:35.640 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: Well,
that's a big one.

00:11:35.640 --> 00:11:39.540 align:middle line:84%
That's-- so does-- and
beyond disconcerting.

00:11:39.540 --> 00:11:40.920 align:middle line:90%
And so OK.

00:11:40.920 --> 00:11:42.090 align:middle line:90%
You got through that moment.

00:11:42.090 --> 00:11:43.260 align:middle line:90%
Your heart slowed down.

00:11:43.260 --> 00:11:44.950 align:middle line:90%
You started chanting some more.

00:11:44.950 --> 00:11:49.020 align:middle line:84%
You start going into that alpha
state of consciousness, maybe

00:11:49.020 --> 00:11:50.430 align:middle line:90%
even beyond that.

00:11:50.430 --> 00:11:51.960 align:middle line:90%
And what was that like?

00:11:51.960 --> 00:11:56.160 align:middle line:84%
How were you seeing the people
in London respond to you?

00:11:56.160 --> 00:12:00.540 align:middle line:84%
It was a crash course
in psychotherapy.

00:12:00.540 --> 00:12:07.800 align:middle line:84%
It was kind of an instant
epiphany of not being the body.

00:12:07.800 --> 00:12:11.730 align:middle line:84%
I mean, lesson 101 of every
authentic spiritual tradition

00:12:11.730 --> 00:12:14.220 align:middle line:84%
is do not be fooled
into thinking

00:12:14.220 --> 00:12:17.790 align:middle line:84%
that you are your physical
body or your subtle mind.

00:12:17.790 --> 00:12:19.620 align:middle line:90%
That is not who you are.

00:12:19.620 --> 00:12:23.250 align:middle line:84%
You are the consciousness that
animates the body and mind,

00:12:23.250 --> 00:12:28.710 align:middle line:84%
and there was no more visceral
experience of that for me

00:12:28.710 --> 00:12:31.570 align:middle line:84%
in those early
days of my journey

00:12:31.570 --> 00:12:35.580 align:middle line:84%
than to be on the
street in London

00:12:35.580 --> 00:12:39.660 align:middle line:84%
looking at people
looking at me and seeing

00:12:39.660 --> 00:12:43.860 align:middle line:84%
their discomfort, and
their uncertainty,

00:12:43.860 --> 00:12:45.390 align:middle line:90%
and sometimes their hostility.

00:12:45.390 --> 00:12:47.220 align:middle line:84%
They'd be so afraid of
what they're seeing.

00:12:47.220 --> 00:12:49.740 align:middle line:84%
They'd come up, and a
couple of times people

00:12:49.740 --> 00:12:50.694 align:middle line:90%
hit me on the head.

00:12:50.694 --> 00:12:51.610 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Oh, really?

00:12:51.610 --> 00:12:52.443 align:middle line:90%
>> GREENE: Oh, yeah.

00:12:52.443 --> 00:12:54.870 align:middle line:84%
I mean, it was so fear-- it
happened in London one time

00:12:54.870 --> 00:12:56.280 align:middle line:90%
and it happened in Paris.

00:12:56.280 --> 00:12:57.960 align:middle line:90%
I can understand it in Paris.

00:12:57.960 --> 00:13:00.420 align:middle line:84%
I mean, here you've got
a country that witnessed

00:13:00.420 --> 00:13:02.310 align:middle line:90%
defeat in two world wars.

00:13:02.310 --> 00:13:06.480 align:middle line:84%
They saw the face and
the costumes of tyranny.

00:13:06.480 --> 00:13:11.460 align:middle line:84%
So I think anyone dressed
in some uniform way behaving

00:13:11.460 --> 00:13:13.550 align:middle line:84%
differently would have
unconsciously triggered

00:13:13.550 --> 00:13:14.550 align:middle line:90%
that kind of a reaction.

00:13:14.550 --> 00:13:15.840 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: And overtly
more emotional people.

00:13:15.840 --> 00:13:16.350 align:middle line:90%
>> GREENE: Sure.

00:13:16.350 --> 00:13:16.680 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Right.

00:13:16.680 --> 00:13:17.480 align:middle line:90%
So that's that.

00:13:17.480 --> 00:13:18.550 align:middle line:90%
Brits are so restrained.

00:13:18.550 --> 00:13:19.350 align:middle line:90%
>> GREENE: Yeah.

00:13:19.350 --> 00:13:20.570 align:middle line:90%
Why it happened in London--

00:13:20.570 --> 00:13:22.020 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: I can't see a
Brit bopping you on the head.

00:13:22.020 --> 00:13:23.340 align:middle line:90%
Maybe he'd come from the pub.

00:13:23.340 --> 00:13:24.840 align:middle line:84%
>> GREENE: Well,
it's a challenge.

00:13:24.840 --> 00:13:26.400 align:middle line:90%
It's throwing down a gauntlet.

00:13:26.400 --> 00:13:29.220 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: And
when do you think,

00:13:29.220 --> 00:13:31.800 align:middle line:84%
with this journey you've been
on so long now and so much

00:13:31.800 --> 00:13:36.090 align:middle line:84%
discovered, what was it that was
being triggered in these people

00:13:36.090 --> 00:13:38.580 align:middle line:90%
that created such terror?

00:13:38.580 --> 00:13:41.790 align:middle line:90%
>> GREENE: Fear of religion.

00:13:41.790 --> 00:13:44.820 align:middle line:84%
Scratch an atheist
and what you find

00:13:44.820 --> 00:13:49.080 align:middle line:84%
is a regular human being who's
had a really bad encounter

00:13:49.080 --> 00:13:50.070 align:middle line:90%
with religion.

00:13:50.070 --> 00:13:51.070 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Usually, yes.

00:13:51.070 --> 00:13:52.170 align:middle line:90%
>> GREENE: Yeah.

00:13:52.170 --> 00:13:58.500 align:middle line:84%
And to literally parade
your faith in public

00:13:58.500 --> 00:14:03.840 align:middle line:84%
is existentially threatening
to a lot of people.

00:14:03.840 --> 00:14:05.686 align:middle line:84%
And you have to
bear that in mind

00:14:05.686 --> 00:14:06.810 align:middle line:90%
if you're going to do that.

00:14:06.810 --> 00:14:11.100 align:middle line:84%
If you're going to wear the
cloth and walk your talk,

00:14:11.100 --> 00:14:13.260 align:middle line:84%
be prepared that
it's going to be

00:14:13.260 --> 00:14:14.670 align:middle line:90%
threatening to certain people.

00:14:14.670 --> 00:14:15.570 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: And a lot of jeering.

00:14:15.570 --> 00:14:16.620 align:middle line:90%
Go get a job.

00:14:16.620 --> 00:14:18.055 align:middle line:84%
Why are you wearing
your pajamas?

00:14:18.055 --> 00:14:18.855 align:middle line:90%
>> GREENE: Sure.

00:14:18.855 --> 00:14:20.324 align:middle line:90%
You can't let throw you.

00:14:20.324 --> 00:14:21.990 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: Yeah, let
stuff get you down.

00:14:21.990 --> 00:14:24.990 align:middle line:84%
But did you feel
in the midst of it

00:14:24.990 --> 00:14:27.780 align:middle line:84%
that you were actually
gaining some kind of traction

00:14:27.780 --> 00:14:29.520 align:middle line:90%
or shifting consciousness?

00:14:29.520 --> 00:14:31.800 align:middle line:84%
Was it-- were you
expecting to have

00:14:31.800 --> 00:14:35.280 align:middle line:84%
an effect in your immediate
world of the passers-by,

00:14:35.280 --> 00:14:38.130 align:middle line:84%
or did you feel more that
you were infusing the field

00:14:38.130 --> 00:14:40.320 align:middle line:90%
with something more joyful?

00:14:40.320 --> 00:14:42.370 align:middle line:90%
>> GREENE: Really good question.

00:14:42.370 --> 00:14:44.340 align:middle line:90%
You know, well, that's a--

00:14:44.340 --> 00:14:48.900 align:middle line:84%
it's taken almost a half century
of Bhakti practice and chanting

00:14:48.900 --> 00:14:51.390 align:middle line:84%
of the Krishna
mantra to really get

00:14:51.390 --> 00:14:53.220 align:middle line:90%
an insight into that question.

00:14:53.220 --> 00:14:56.070 align:middle line:84%
I think in the moment,
it was more a sense

00:14:56.070 --> 00:14:57.600 align:middle line:90%
that I have a teacher now.

00:14:57.600 --> 00:14:59.470 align:middle line:90%
I have a guru.

00:14:59.470 --> 00:15:00.330 align:middle line:90%
Prabhupada.

00:15:00.330 --> 00:15:06.300 align:middle line:84%
And he has encouraged us to do
this as an act of compassion

00:15:06.300 --> 00:15:08.860 align:middle line:90%
toward others.

00:15:08.860 --> 00:15:11.260 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: Yet, it
pushed their buttons.

00:15:11.260 --> 00:15:13.020 align:middle line:84%
>> GREENE: Well, that's
what a guru does.

00:15:13.020 --> 00:15:14.800 align:middle line:90%
A guru pushes buttons.

00:15:14.800 --> 00:15:19.210 align:middle line:84%
He is not there to encourage
you in your complacency.

00:15:19.210 --> 00:15:22.720 align:middle line:84%
He's there to shake you
out of your complacency

00:15:22.720 --> 00:15:26.500 align:middle line:84%
by providing knowledge
and opportunities

00:15:26.500 --> 00:15:28.840 align:middle line:84%
for you to stretch
your own boundaries.

00:15:28.840 --> 00:15:29.750 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: So how--

00:15:29.750 --> 00:15:33.250 align:middle line:84%
now, in this in-between place
you are in, still as a novice,

00:15:33.250 --> 00:15:35.560 align:middle line:84%
even, how did you
embrace the message

00:15:35.560 --> 00:15:38.020 align:middle line:84%
that you're doing
an act of compassion

00:15:38.020 --> 00:15:41.440 align:middle line:84%
by chanting Hare Krishna when
all these people passing by

00:15:41.440 --> 00:15:45.400 align:middle line:84%
were clearly agitated
or confronted by it?

00:15:45.400 --> 00:15:46.700 align:middle line:90%
How did those two--

00:15:46.700 --> 00:15:47.500 align:middle line:90%
>> GREENE: Yeah.

00:15:47.500 --> 00:15:49.810 align:middle line:84%
Well, as a 19-year-old,
as a 20-year-old,

00:15:49.810 --> 00:15:54.880 align:middle line:84%
I think it was more an act of
faith than of real realization.

00:15:54.880 --> 00:15:56.530 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Right.

00:15:56.530 --> 00:15:57.970 align:middle line:90%
>> GREENE: I trusted my teacher.

00:15:57.970 --> 00:16:00.880 align:middle line:90%
I trusted Prabhupada.

00:16:00.880 --> 00:16:04.690 align:middle line:84%
And if he said this
is OK, that this

00:16:04.690 --> 00:16:07.520 align:middle line:84%
will have a cleansing
effect on people--

00:16:07.520 --> 00:16:10.630 align:middle line:84%
the power of mantra
is such that, if it's

00:16:10.630 --> 00:16:15.190 align:middle line:84%
chanted in public, even
after the chanters have left,

00:16:15.190 --> 00:16:18.640 align:middle line:84%
they've created an atmosphere
such that people walking

00:16:18.640 --> 00:16:20.421 align:middle line:90%
through that space--

00:16:20.421 --> 00:16:21.920 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: That's
what I was asking.

00:16:21.920 --> 00:16:22.540 align:middle line:90%
>> GREENE: Absolutely.

00:16:22.540 --> 00:16:23.748 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: That's the effect.

00:16:23.748 --> 00:16:27.220 align:middle line:84%
So tell us, first of all, the
entire mantra, what it means.

00:16:27.220 --> 00:16:30.820 align:middle line:84%
It's a simple meaning,
and it has Rama in it.

00:16:30.820 --> 00:16:31.780 align:middle line:90%
Not just Krishna.

00:16:31.780 --> 00:16:33.090 align:middle line:90%
So tell us what this means.

00:16:33.090 --> 00:16:33.890 align:middle line:90%
>> GREENE: Right.

00:16:33.890 --> 00:16:37.360 align:middle line:84%
Well, at the base of devotional
practice, Bhakti yoga,

00:16:37.360 --> 00:16:40.150 align:middle line:90%
is the chanting of gods' names.

00:16:40.150 --> 00:16:42.010 align:middle line:84%
The Krishna mantra
in particular is

00:16:42.010 --> 00:16:46.450 align:middle line:84%
referenced in the ancient
Sanskrit texts as effective

00:16:46.450 --> 00:16:47.830 align:middle line:90%
in Kali Yuga.

00:16:47.830 --> 00:16:53.710 align:middle line:84%
It's kind of a main line,
direct express connection

00:16:53.710 --> 00:16:55.300 align:middle line:90%
with divinity.

00:16:55.300 --> 00:16:58.390 align:middle line:84%
And the three words of
the mantra, Hare, Krishna,

00:16:58.390 --> 00:17:04.230 align:middle line:84%
and Rama, are constructed
in this 16-word order.

00:17:04.230 --> 00:17:08.530 align:middle line:84%
Hare Krishna, Hare Krishna,
Krishna Krishna, Hare Hare,

00:17:08.530 --> 00:17:12.550 align:middle line:84%
Hare Rama, Hare Rama,
Rama Rama, Hare Hare.

00:17:12.550 --> 00:17:15.520 align:middle line:84%
The word Hare is the
evocative of Hara,

00:17:15.520 --> 00:17:19.900 align:middle line:84%
which is the name of Radha,
god in feminine form.

00:17:19.900 --> 00:17:23.319 align:middle line:84%
And one of the things that
attracted me about the Krishna

00:17:23.319 --> 00:17:29.290 align:middle line:84%
practice was that it had the
insight to acknowledge divinity

00:17:29.290 --> 00:17:32.050 align:middle line:90%
in both male and female form.

00:17:32.050 --> 00:17:34.440 align:middle line:84%
So quite different
from the misogynistic--

00:17:34.440 --> 00:17:35.950 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: And we're going to
get into that in a little bit.

00:17:35.950 --> 00:17:38.075 align:middle line:84%
>> GREENE: Paternalistic
religious traditions.

00:17:38.075 --> 00:17:38.875 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Yes.

00:17:38.875 --> 00:17:40.622 align:middle line:84%
So it's male-female
deity in form.

00:17:40.622 --> 00:17:41.830 align:middle line:90%
>> GREENE: So there was that.

00:17:41.830 --> 00:17:44.260 align:middle line:90%
So Hare is an invocation.

00:17:44.260 --> 00:17:48.280 align:middle line:84%
It's an appeal to Radha,
god in feminine form,

00:17:48.280 --> 00:17:50.770 align:middle line:90%
to accept us in devotional life.

00:17:50.770 --> 00:17:53.380 align:middle line:84%
Krishna simply means
the most attractive.

00:17:53.380 --> 00:17:56.020 align:middle line:84%
It's a very universal
name for divinity.

00:17:56.020 --> 00:17:59.070 align:middle line:84%
Rama means the highest
pleasure possible.

00:17:59.070 --> 00:18:03.430 align:middle line:84%
So through effective,
authentic spiritual practice,

00:18:03.430 --> 00:18:07.250 align:middle line:84%
yogis encounter
the highest bliss.

00:18:07.250 --> 00:18:10.004 align:middle line:84%
So that's the meaning
of those three words.

00:18:10.004 --> 00:18:11.170 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: It's interesting.

00:18:11.170 --> 00:18:13.800 align:middle line:84%
I'm just thinking of,
you know, Greek mythology

00:18:13.800 --> 00:18:16.510 align:middle line:90%
with Zeus and Hera.

00:18:16.510 --> 00:18:19.610 align:middle line:84%
Hara and Hera, again,
the female compliment.

00:18:19.610 --> 00:18:21.560 align:middle line:90%
And this seems to play out.

00:18:21.560 --> 00:18:25.480 align:middle line:84%
The Vedas preceded the Greek
mythology or the Greek gods

00:18:25.480 --> 00:18:29.230 align:middle line:84%
in our understanding
in the scribing of it.

00:18:29.230 --> 00:18:32.600 align:middle line:84%
>> GREENE: Well, if you go
to authentic traditions,

00:18:32.600 --> 00:18:36.100 align:middle line:84%
whether it be Greek, or whether
it's the ancient Christian

00:18:36.100 --> 00:18:39.760 align:middle line:84%
mystic traditions, or the
Sufi tradition in Islam,

00:18:39.760 --> 00:18:43.540 align:middle line:84%
or kabbalah in Judaism,
you find equivalence.

00:18:43.540 --> 00:18:45.510 align:middle line:90%
It's not a new idea.

00:18:45.510 --> 00:18:50.110 align:middle line:84%
I mean, Shekhinah, for
example, the feminine divinity

00:18:50.110 --> 00:18:52.690 align:middle line:90%
in Judaism.

00:18:52.690 --> 00:18:59.680 align:middle line:84%
The mystic bride marriage
in Christianity--

00:18:59.680 --> 00:19:02.200 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: Which is not
acknowledged by the majority--

00:19:02.200 --> 00:19:03.000 align:middle line:90%
>> GREENE: No.

00:19:03.000 --> 00:19:03.170 align:middle line:90%
It's too threatening.

00:19:03.170 --> 00:19:04.780 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: In the
Christian world.

00:19:04.780 --> 00:19:08.340 align:middle line:84%
So the Christian world's
quite absent of that,

00:19:08.340 --> 00:19:09.820 align:middle line:90%
for the most part.

00:19:09.820 --> 00:19:12.000 align:middle line:90%
I was raised a Lutheran.

00:19:12.000 --> 00:19:13.280 align:middle line:90%
There were no women.

00:19:13.280 --> 00:19:15.490 align:middle line:90%
They were just bells.

00:19:15.490 --> 00:19:16.290 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:19:16.290 --> 00:19:16.470 align:middle line:90%
Good.

00:19:16.470 --> 00:19:18.630 align:middle line:84%
Thank you for explaining
what that means.

00:19:18.630 --> 00:19:20.370 align:middle line:84%
It's important to
understand what was

00:19:20.370 --> 00:19:22.110 align:middle line:90%
being projected into the field.

00:19:22.110 --> 00:19:24.090 align:middle line:84%
Now I would like-- and
thank you for sharing

00:19:24.090 --> 00:19:25.170 align:middle line:90%
your personal story.

00:19:25.170 --> 00:19:28.420 align:middle line:84%
That's really interesting, about
running into your ex-girlfriend

00:19:28.420 --> 00:19:29.287 align:middle line:90%
the first day.

00:19:29.287 --> 00:19:31.620 align:middle line:84%
>> GREENE: I haven't told
that story before, by the way.

00:19:31.620 --> 00:19:32.430 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Oh my god.

00:19:32.430 --> 00:19:33.644 align:middle line:90%
I mean, I can feel the pain.

00:19:33.644 --> 00:19:35.310 align:middle line:84%
>> GREENE: You're
bringing it out in me.

00:19:35.310 --> 00:19:38.820 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: I think our viewers
very much have appreciated it.

00:19:38.820 --> 00:19:42.930 align:middle line:84%
Let's now go into Prabhupada,
because this is a character,

00:19:42.930 --> 00:19:46.830 align:middle line:84%
an individual incarnated
in the human body

00:19:46.830 --> 00:19:49.950 align:middle line:84%
that, by the age of
five, he was digging

00:19:49.950 --> 00:19:52.020 align:middle line:90%
all the ceremonies passing by.

00:19:52.020 --> 00:19:52.920 align:middle line:90%
He wanted his own.

00:19:52.920 --> 00:19:54.900 align:middle line:84%
Explain the little
cart, explain--

00:19:54.900 --> 00:19:56.550 align:middle line:90%
he was five, six years old--

00:19:56.550 --> 00:20:00.060 align:middle line:84%
what he asked his parents for,
and how it was affecting him,

00:20:00.060 --> 00:20:03.430 align:middle line:84%
and its place in the
ceremonial rites.

00:20:03.430 --> 00:20:04.230 align:middle line:90%
>> GREENE: Sure.

00:20:04.230 --> 00:20:06.180 align:middle line:84%
Well, thank you for
inviting me to talk

00:20:06.180 --> 00:20:10.140 align:middle line:84%
about my favorite topic,
which is my teacher.

00:20:10.140 --> 00:20:12.690 align:middle line:84%
Just a little bit
of context here.

00:20:12.690 --> 00:20:17.380 align:middle line:84%
Prabhupada was born into
British colonial India in 1896.

00:20:17.380 --> 00:20:19.460 align:middle line:84%
So he wasn't even born
in the 20th century.

00:20:19.460 --> 00:20:21.570 align:middle line:90%
Born in the 19th century.

00:20:21.570 --> 00:20:29.210 align:middle line:84%
And the image of Hindu
culture at that time

00:20:29.210 --> 00:20:32.570 align:middle line:90%
was not particularly flattering.

00:20:32.570 --> 00:20:36.440 align:middle line:84%
The Christian missionaries who
had come mostly from England,

00:20:36.440 --> 00:20:40.280 align:middle line:84%
but from elsewhere, had
taken it upon themselves

00:20:40.280 --> 00:20:45.920 align:middle line:84%
to convert Hindus to the true
light of the Christian church.

00:20:45.920 --> 00:20:51.200 align:middle line:84%
And the one offense that
they found most egregious

00:20:51.200 --> 00:20:54.710 align:middle line:84%
was what they
called idol worship.

00:20:54.710 --> 00:20:58.280 align:middle line:84%
Of all the deities in India,
of all the gods worshipped

00:20:58.280 --> 00:21:02.770 align:middle line:84%
in India, can you guess
who was the most egregious?

00:21:02.770 --> 00:21:03.570 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Krishna.

00:21:03.570 --> 00:21:04.560 align:middle line:90%
>> GREENE: Krishna.

00:21:04.560 --> 00:21:06.270 align:middle line:90%
Why Krishna?

00:21:06.270 --> 00:21:08.610 align:middle line:90%
Because he's the god of love.

00:21:08.610 --> 00:21:11.910 align:middle line:84%
The image of Krishna
playing his flute

00:21:11.910 --> 00:21:16.650 align:middle line:84%
and dancing with the
cowherd girls of his village

00:21:16.650 --> 00:21:21.834 align:middle line:84%
was everything objectionable to
the enlightened European mind.

00:21:21.834 --> 00:21:24.250 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: Probably close to
even obscene because it would

00:21:24.250 --> 00:21:27.074 align:middle line:84%
denote something that could

00:21:27.074 --> 00:21:27.990 align:middle line:90%
>> GREENE: Absolutely.

00:21:27.990 --> 00:21:31.920 align:middle line:84%
In fact, there are quotes from
missionaries of the day saying

00:21:31.920 --> 00:21:37.530 align:middle line:84%
this licentious,
heathen practice

00:21:37.530 --> 00:21:39.840 align:middle line:84%
must be rejected
if Hindus are ever

00:21:39.840 --> 00:21:42.990 align:middle line:84%
going to take their place
at the table of the world.

00:21:42.990 --> 00:21:44.220 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Under us.

00:21:44.220 --> 00:21:44.610 align:middle line:90%
>> GREENE: Absolutely.

00:21:44.610 --> 00:21:45.443 align:middle line:90%
&Gt;> REGINA: Right.

00:21:45.443 --> 00:21:47.820 align:middle line:84%
>> GREENE: So here
was Prabhupada,

00:21:47.820 --> 00:21:50.295 align:middle line:84%
born into an orthodox
Krishna worshipping family,

00:21:50.295 --> 00:21:53.130 align:middle line:90%
a Vaishnava family.

00:21:53.130 --> 00:21:56.850 align:middle line:84%
His father, Gour Mohan
De had other children,

00:21:56.850 --> 00:22:01.830 align:middle line:84%
but he saw something in
this young boy, his son,

00:22:01.830 --> 00:22:03.530 align:middle line:90%
who was named Abhay Charan--

00:22:03.530 --> 00:22:05.580 align:middle line:90%
that's the A.C. in his name--

00:22:05.580 --> 00:22:09.480 align:middle line:84%
meaning one who is fearless
having taken shelter

00:22:09.480 --> 00:22:11.010 align:middle line:90%
at the feet of the lord.

00:22:11.010 --> 00:22:14.430 align:middle line:84%
That's the definition
of those two names.

00:22:14.430 --> 00:22:17.370 align:middle line:84%
This young man,
Abhay's father said,

00:22:17.370 --> 00:22:21.600 align:middle line:84%
will succumb neither to the
propaganda of the British

00:22:21.600 --> 00:22:25.890 align:middle line:84%
nor the distortions of
the Hindu intelligentsia.

00:22:25.890 --> 00:22:30.300 align:middle line:84%
Now, what he meant by that was
the reaction of the Bhadralok,

00:22:30.300 --> 00:22:35.310 align:middle line:84%
as they were called, the Kolkata
Hindu intellectual class,

00:22:35.310 --> 00:22:40.960 align:middle line:84%
to this infiltration by
European Christianity

00:22:40.960 --> 00:22:44.200 align:middle line:84%
was, OK, what do we
have to do to make

00:22:44.200 --> 00:22:47.170 align:middle line:84%
Hinduism acceptable to
the rest of the world.

00:22:47.170 --> 00:22:50.110 align:middle line:84%
So rather than educating
themselves deeper

00:22:50.110 --> 00:22:53.080 align:middle line:84%
about Krishna,
their conclusion was

00:22:53.080 --> 00:22:55.360 align:middle line:84%
let's just strip away
everything that the Europeans

00:22:55.360 --> 00:22:56.700 align:middle line:90%
find objectionable.

00:22:56.700 --> 00:22:58.210 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: What's that leave?

00:22:58.210 --> 00:23:06.670 align:middle line:84%
>> GREENE: What it leaves is a
kind of monistic pablum which

00:23:06.670 --> 00:23:12.130 align:middle line:84%
says don't be offended by these
beginners in spiritual life who

00:23:12.130 --> 00:23:13.880 align:middle line:84%
are worshiping
Krishna and deities.

00:23:13.880 --> 00:23:16.000 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Primitives.

00:23:16.000 --> 00:23:17.050 align:middle line:90%
>> GREENE: That's right.

00:23:17.050 --> 00:23:18.820 align:middle line:84%
These are undeveloped
minds trying

00:23:18.820 --> 00:23:21.670 align:middle line:84%
to grasp very
sophisticated concepts,

00:23:21.670 --> 00:23:23.740 align:middle line:84%
and when they've
evolved more, they'll

00:23:23.740 --> 00:23:26.080 align:middle line:84%
leave behind Krishna, and
the worship of Krishna,

00:23:26.080 --> 00:23:27.790 align:middle line:90%
and all that stuff.

00:23:27.790 --> 00:23:33.340 align:middle line:84%
And so you have these two
very powerful energies

00:23:33.340 --> 00:23:37.167 align:middle line:90%
conspiring against personalism.

00:23:37.167 --> 00:23:38.750 align:middle line:84%
Now, it's very
important to understand

00:23:38.750 --> 00:23:42.095 align:middle line:84%
that what Prabhupada's
contribution was,

00:23:42.095 --> 00:23:47.940 align:middle line:84%
was to re-establish the
validity of a personal divinity,

00:23:47.940 --> 00:23:50.910 align:middle line:84%
and that's what the Krishna
movement is all about.

00:23:50.910 --> 00:23:55.080 align:middle line:84%
What he started was the
Western world branch

00:23:55.080 --> 00:23:57.960 align:middle line:84%
of this ancient,
personalist tradition

00:23:57.960 --> 00:24:00.960 align:middle line:90%
of Bhakti or devotional yoga.

00:24:00.960 --> 00:24:05.820 align:middle line:84%
So he's born at a time when
these powerful influences are

00:24:05.820 --> 00:24:07.440 align:middle line:90%
conspiring against him.

00:24:07.440 --> 00:24:10.470 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: Let me add one
more thing here, if you would,

00:24:10.470 --> 00:24:11.910 align:middle line:90%
to have you explain.

00:24:11.910 --> 00:24:14.220 align:middle line:84%
Not only that, the
Brits were really

00:24:14.220 --> 00:24:18.330 align:middle line:84%
creating extreme divisiveness
between all of the religions

00:24:18.330 --> 00:24:21.690 align:middle line:84%
within India that had
previously live side by side.

00:24:21.690 --> 00:24:23.750 align:middle line:84%
Hindus against
Muslims and so on.

00:24:23.750 --> 00:24:24.550 align:middle line:90%
>> GREENE: Sure.

00:24:24.550 --> 00:24:26.670 align:middle line:84%
Yeah, in fact,
Prabhupada's neighborhood

00:24:26.670 --> 00:24:33.720 align:middle line:84%
was arbitrarily segregated
by the British into ghettos.

00:24:33.720 --> 00:24:36.990 align:middle line:84%
There was a Muslim ghetto
and there was a Hindu ghetto.

00:24:36.990 --> 00:24:41.070 align:middle line:84%
So from a young age,
Prabhupada saw the consequence

00:24:41.070 --> 00:24:44.820 align:middle line:84%
of that kind of
bigotry, that kind

00:24:44.820 --> 00:24:50.800 align:middle line:84%
of religious prejudice on
the part of the British

00:24:50.800 --> 00:24:53.020 align:middle line:90%
and part of the Raj.

00:24:53.020 --> 00:24:56.770 align:middle line:84%
And so imagine
growing up, perhaps

00:24:56.770 --> 00:25:00.350 align:middle line:84%
akin to what it's like being
black or Hispanic in America.

00:25:00.350 --> 00:25:01.150 align:middle line:90%
You know.

00:25:01.150 --> 00:25:04.210 align:middle line:90%
You're not the mainstream here.

00:25:04.210 --> 00:25:06.850 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: And before, there was
this cross-pollination between

00:25:06.850 --> 00:25:08.260 align:middle line:90%
the cultures and religions.

00:25:08.260 --> 00:25:09.630 align:middle line:90%
People, families were friends.

00:25:09.630 --> 00:25:11.620 align:middle line:84%
>> GREENE: They lived
together side by side.

00:25:11.620 --> 00:25:12.820 align:middle line:90%
Children played together.

00:25:12.820 --> 00:25:14.500 align:middle line:90%
People did business together.

00:25:14.500 --> 00:25:22.090 align:middle line:84%
It wasn't a problem until it was
made a problem by the British,

00:25:22.090 --> 00:25:24.800 align:middle line:90%
initially through census.

00:25:24.800 --> 00:25:27.250 align:middle line:84%
On their census forms,
they enforced people

00:25:27.250 --> 00:25:29.050 align:middle line:90%
to say what is your religion.

00:25:29.050 --> 00:25:31.600 align:middle line:90%
Are you Hindu or are you Muslim?

00:25:31.600 --> 00:25:36.280 align:middle line:84%
Before that, Hinduism
was never a religion.

00:25:36.280 --> 00:25:37.400 align:middle line:90%
It was not a religion.

00:25:37.400 --> 00:25:39.660 align:middle line:90%
It was a spiritual practice.

00:25:39.660 --> 00:25:43.720 align:middle line:84%
The name Hindu isn't
even indigenous to India.

00:25:43.720 --> 00:25:47.530 align:middle line:84%
It's a name that was
given by the British

00:25:47.530 --> 00:25:49.540 align:middle line:90%
in their census forms.

00:25:49.540 --> 00:25:55.150 align:middle line:84%
The word originally
came from the Mughals,

00:25:55.150 --> 00:25:58.330 align:middle line:84%
who pronounced
their S's like H's.

00:25:58.330 --> 00:26:01.510 align:middle line:84%
So the people living on the
other side of the Sindh River

00:26:01.510 --> 00:26:03.762 align:middle line:90%
became the Hinds.

00:26:03.762 --> 00:26:05.470 align:middle line:84%
And that's where the
British got the idea

00:26:05.470 --> 00:26:10.150 align:middle line:84%
of calling indigenous
religions of India Hinduism.

00:26:10.150 --> 00:26:13.810 align:middle line:84%
But you never find that word
in any of the Sanskrit text.

00:26:13.810 --> 00:26:18.257 align:middle line:84%
The wisdom texts of India do
not mention Hinduism anywhere.

00:26:18.257 --> 00:26:19.840 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: That's
interesting to note.

00:26:19.840 --> 00:26:21.232 align:middle line:90%
So now you have Hindus, Muslims.

00:26:21.232 --> 00:26:22.690 align:middle line:84%
You have the Brits
overseeing this.

00:26:22.690 --> 00:26:23.773 align:middle line:90%
>> GREENE: All artificial.

00:26:23.773 --> 00:26:28.420 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: And you're having
the essence of the religion

00:26:28.420 --> 00:26:32.020 align:middle line:84%
stripped down to some almost
scientific, bare bones reality.

00:26:32.020 --> 00:26:32.820 align:middle line:90%
Right?

00:26:32.820 --> 00:26:35.010 align:middle line:84%
And so now you have
this little boy

00:26:35.010 --> 00:26:38.200 align:middle line:84%
who's being brought
up to resist this.

00:26:38.200 --> 00:26:39.890 align:middle line:90%
>> GREENE: Well, he is.

00:26:39.890 --> 00:26:46.990 align:middle line:84%
And again, going back to that
Joseph Campbell Monomyth model,

00:26:46.990 --> 00:26:50.500 align:middle line:84%
there is a moment of
what Campbell calls

00:26:50.500 --> 00:26:53.530 align:middle line:90%
the meeting with the mentor.

00:26:53.530 --> 00:26:56.920 align:middle line:84%
You hear something
in your life that you

00:26:56.920 --> 00:26:59.530 align:middle line:84%
may have heard 100 times
before, but somehow,

00:26:59.530 --> 00:27:02.810 align:middle line:84%
this person saying it
to you, it gets through.

00:27:02.810 --> 00:27:07.380 align:middle line:84%
That was when young Prabhupada,
Abhay, met his guru,

00:27:07.380 --> 00:27:08.920 align:middle line:90%
Bhaktisiddhanta Sarasvati.

00:27:08.920 --> 00:27:11.200 align:middle line:90%
It was in 1922.

00:27:11.200 --> 00:27:13.390 align:middle line:84%
He was at a place
called the Gaudiya Math,

00:27:13.390 --> 00:27:17.170 align:middle line:84%
which was Bhaktisiddhanta's
spiritual schools,

00:27:17.170 --> 00:27:19.680 align:middle line:90%
a series of them.

00:27:19.680 --> 00:27:22.620 align:middle line:84%
And Bhaktisiddhanta,
who is a very erudite

00:27:22.620 --> 00:27:26.310 align:middle line:84%
Krishna worshipper, when
he saw this young man--

00:27:26.310 --> 00:27:30.960 align:middle line:84%
Prabhupada at that time
must've been 26 years old--

00:27:30.960 --> 00:27:33.270 align:middle line:84%
the first thing that
Bhaktisiddhanta said to him

00:27:33.270 --> 00:27:36.750 align:middle line:84%
is, you look to me like a
very intelligent fellow.

00:27:36.750 --> 00:27:40.530 align:middle line:84%
Why don't you take
this Krishna teachings

00:27:40.530 --> 00:27:42.510 align:middle line:90%
and bring them to the west?

00:27:42.510 --> 00:27:46.050 align:middle line:84%
Talk to people in English
about the Bhagavad Gita,

00:27:46.050 --> 00:27:47.780 align:middle line:84%
and the chanting of
the Krishna mantra,

00:27:47.780 --> 00:27:49.125 align:middle line:90%
and living a devotional life.

00:27:49.125 --> 00:27:52.140 align:middle line:90%


00:27:52.140 --> 00:27:58.610 align:middle line:84%
To this day, I wonder what that
must have felt like for him,

00:27:58.610 --> 00:28:01.130 align:middle line:84%
on the first meeting
with his guru,

00:28:01.130 --> 00:28:03.920 align:middle line:90%
to be given this life mission.

00:28:03.920 --> 00:28:05.217 align:middle line:90%
Go to the west.

00:28:05.217 --> 00:28:06.300 align:middle line:90%
The idea of leaving India.

00:28:06.300 --> 00:28:07.940 align:middle line:90%
He had never been outside India.

00:28:07.940 --> 00:28:10.130 align:middle line:84%
It was hard to get
outside India in 1922.

00:28:10.130 --> 00:28:11.210 align:middle line:90%
You couldn't do it.

00:28:11.210 --> 00:28:12.500 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Right.

00:28:12.500 --> 00:28:15.100 align:middle line:84%
And seeing the influence of
the West on their own culture.

00:28:15.100 --> 00:28:15.900 align:middle line:90%
>> GREENE: Exactly.

00:28:15.900 --> 00:28:16.910 align:middle line:90%

Exactly.

00:28:18.400 --> 00:28:20.810 align:middle line:84%
And the only
impression that people

00:28:20.810 --> 00:28:23.990 align:middle line:84%
had in India at that time of
America-- because the West

00:28:23.990 --> 00:28:25.190 align:middle line:90%
meant the United States.

00:28:25.190 --> 00:28:28.070 align:middle line:84%
Right-- was from
"National Geographic"

00:28:28.070 --> 00:28:29.750 align:middle line:90%
magazine, "Life" magazine.

00:28:29.750 --> 00:28:32.150 align:middle line:84%
You know, the publications
that were distributed there.

00:28:32.150 --> 00:28:33.410 align:middle line:90%

00:28:41.645 --> 00:28:43.280 align:middle line:84%
I mean, you know,

00:28:43.280 --> 00:28:45.090 align:middle line:90%
that's like, oh my gosh.

00:28:45.090 --> 00:28:46.280 align:middle line:90%
What is that?

00:28:46.280 --> 00:28:52.400 align:middle line:84%
So the idea of voluntarily going
into that hell to tell people

00:28:52.400 --> 00:28:54.514 align:middle line:90%
give up meat--

00:28:54.514 --> 00:28:55.680 align:middle line:90%

Give up sex outside of

Give up gambling.

00:29:00.890 --> 00:29:03.550 align:middle line:90%
Give-- you have to be crazy.

00:29:03.550 --> 00:29:04.350 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Right.

00:29:04.350 --> 00:29:06.470 align:middle line:84%
Didn't Seem like a
natural fit at the time.

00:29:06.470 --> 00:29:09.450 align:middle line:84%
>> GREENE: Not the first thing
you'd think about as a career

00:29:09.450 --> 00:29:10.250 align:middle line:90%
path.

00:29:10.250 --> 00:29:11.090 align:middle line:90%
Right.

00:29:11.090 --> 00:29:13.548 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: Well, but he-- there
was something in him that--

00:29:13.548 --> 00:29:16.510 align:middle line:84%
as I mentioned that cute little
story of when he was little--

00:29:16.510 --> 00:29:18.620 align:middle line:84%
was so devotional from
such an early age.

00:29:18.620 --> 00:29:22.010 align:middle line:84%
Clearly, his being had
incarnated to take this on.

00:29:22.010 --> 00:29:25.630 align:middle line:84%
He was making his
own displays in

00:29:25.630 --> 00:29:29.210 align:middle line:84%
the great religious
celebrations of his little cart

00:29:29.210 --> 00:29:31.410 align:middle line:84%
with Krishna, and little
symbols, and little drums.

00:29:31.410 --> 00:29:32.210 align:middle line:90%
>> GREENE: Yeah.

00:29:32.210 --> 00:29:33.010 align:middle line:90%
Oh, yeah.

00:29:33.010 --> 00:29:35.970 align:middle line:90%
He took to it quite naturally.

00:29:35.970 --> 00:29:42.140 align:middle line:84%
And you're putting your
finger on a difficult issue

00:29:42.140 --> 00:29:44.420 align:middle line:90%
for me, Regina.

00:29:44.420 --> 00:29:49.460 align:middle line:84%
I had to figure out in writing
"Swami in a Strange Land"

00:29:49.460 --> 00:29:55.490 align:middle line:84%
how much to honor that
vision of Prabhupada

00:29:55.490 --> 00:29:59.480 align:middle line:84%
as this divine soul who had
come into the world, God's

00:29:59.480 --> 00:30:03.020 align:middle line:84%
missionary, to essentially
bring salvation to humanity.

00:30:03.020 --> 00:30:05.270 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: It's obvious, or
he wouldn't have had those

00:30:05.270 --> 00:30:07.100 align:middle line:84%
proclivities as a
tiny little boy.

00:30:07.100 --> 00:30:08.180 align:middle line:90%
>> GREENE: It was there.

00:30:08.180 --> 00:30:10.030 align:middle line:84%
It was clearly there
from previous lives.

00:30:10.030 --> 00:30:11.900 align:middle line:10%
>> REGINA: Exactly.

00:30:11.900 --> 00:30:16.760 align:middle line:10%
>> GREENE: But if I wanted
people to be able to identify

00:30:16.760 --> 00:30:20.240 align:middle line:10%
with him, if I wanted people
to take seriously the teachings

00:30:20.240 --> 00:30:23.450 align:middle line:10%
that he brought for us-- he
wasn't teaching Hinduism.

00:30:23.450 --> 00:30:28.160 align:middle line:84%
So how do I put that in a
biography of this person

00:30:28.160 --> 00:30:31.430 align:middle line:84%
in a way that makes it
acceptable and real?

00:30:31.430 --> 00:30:34.610 align:middle line:84%
So the struggle for me as
the author of this book

00:30:34.610 --> 00:30:43.720 align:middle line:84%
was to make him human enough
that readers would consider,

00:30:43.720 --> 00:30:44.800 align:middle line:90%
yeah.

00:30:44.800 --> 00:30:45.640 align:middle line:90%
He came.

00:30:45.640 --> 00:30:45.940 align:middle line:90%
All right.

00:30:45.940 --> 00:30:47.481 align:middle line:84%
I understand this
person came for me.

00:30:47.481 --> 00:30:50.220 align:middle line:90%
I'm involved in this somehow.

00:30:50.220 --> 00:30:53.210 align:middle line:90%
And yeah.

00:30:53.210 --> 00:30:56.850 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: But the truth is,
that's why I resonated with

00:30:56.850 --> 00:30:59.780 align:middle line:84%
the story, because obviously--
and you're talking to a lot

00:30:59.780 --> 00:31:02.540 align:middle line:84%
of very beautiful minds right
now who are watching this,

00:31:02.540 --> 00:31:03.920 align:middle line:84%
and they understand
these things,

00:31:03.920 --> 00:31:07.770 align:middle line:90%
that beings come with purpose.

00:31:07.770 --> 00:31:11.420 align:middle line:84%
He was pre-wired for this
purpose before his incarnation

00:31:11.420 --> 00:31:15.350 align:middle line:84%
and he was displaying his
own passion and ecstasy

00:31:15.350 --> 00:31:18.250 align:middle line:90%
at a very early age for this.

00:31:18.250 --> 00:31:19.760 align:middle line:90%
>> GREENE: That's quite true.

00:31:19.760 --> 00:31:23.420 align:middle line:84%
He had a small Ratha
Yatra cart, which

00:31:23.420 --> 00:31:30.650 align:middle line:84%
is a decorated model
of the large Rath carts

00:31:30.650 --> 00:31:32.180 align:middle line:84%
that are pulled
through the streets

00:31:32.180 --> 00:31:34.730 align:middle line:84%
each year in a big festival
called the Ratha Yatra

00:31:34.730 --> 00:31:36.890 align:middle line:90%
festival, the chariot festival.

00:31:36.890 --> 00:31:44.180 align:middle line:84%
These are six, seven story tall
huge, monumental, extremely

00:31:44.180 --> 00:31:47.930 align:middle line:84%
heavy chariots with big wheels
that weigh several tons,

00:31:47.930 --> 00:31:50.600 align:middle line:84%
and they're pulled through the
streets in the town of Puri

00:31:50.600 --> 00:31:52.670 align:middle line:84%
in Orissa by
millions of pilgrims

00:31:52.670 --> 00:31:55.850 align:middle line:84%
on these huge,
thick, long ropes.

00:31:55.850 --> 00:31:58.370 align:middle line:84%
Prabhupada was always
excited by the description

00:31:58.370 --> 00:32:01.010 align:middle line:84%
of this festival as a young
boy and wanted a chariot

00:32:01.010 --> 00:32:03.200 align:middle line:84%
like that of his
own, so his father

00:32:03.200 --> 00:32:05.600 align:middle line:84%
bought him a little
wooden model,

00:32:05.600 --> 00:32:09.500 align:middle line:84%
and Prabhupada staged his
own Ratha Yatra festival

00:32:09.500 --> 00:32:11.647 align:middle line:84%
in his neighborhood
with all the kids.

00:32:11.647 --> 00:32:13.480 align:middle line:84%
Called the kids around,
hey, you play drums.

00:32:13.480 --> 00:32:14.320 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: His like
three feet tall.

00:32:14.320 --> 00:32:16.960 align:middle line:84%
&Gt;> GREENE: He was organizing
stuff even at age six.

00:32:16.960 --> 00:32:19.640 align:middle line:84%
So this was-- you know, he
was showing his proclivities

00:32:19.640 --> 00:32:20.870 align:middle line:90%
at a very early age.

00:32:20.870 --> 00:32:20.990 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Exactly.

00:32:20.990 --> 00:32:22.906 align:middle line:84%
And I just bring that
up so people understand,

00:32:22.906 --> 00:32:24.700 align:middle line:84%
he came pre-wired
for this mission.

00:32:24.700 --> 00:32:26.240 align:middle line:90%
>> GREENE: It was there.

00:32:26.240 --> 00:32:27.740 align:middle line:90%
It was there.

00:32:27.740 --> 00:32:30.020 align:middle line:90%
But truth be told--

00:32:30.020 --> 00:32:31.940 align:middle line:84%
and again, if you
haven't figured it out,

00:32:31.940 --> 00:32:34.670 align:middle line:90%
I am a Campbell fan--

00:32:34.670 --> 00:32:38.990 align:middle line:84%
it ain't easy, even for the
avatars and the great souls.

00:32:38.990 --> 00:32:40.790 align:middle line:90%
It ain't easy.

00:32:40.790 --> 00:32:45.260 align:middle line:84%
Nobody should have that idea
that, oh, well, a great soul.

00:32:45.260 --> 00:32:46.240 align:middle line:90%
He never suffered.

00:32:46.240 --> 00:32:47.240 align:middle line:90%
He never-- you know.

00:32:47.240 --> 00:32:48.170 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: No, of course not.

00:32:48.170 --> 00:32:50.302 align:middle line:84%
>> GREENE: The suffering,
if anything, was greater.

00:32:50.302 --> 00:32:52.480 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: Oh, I mean, his
life is really amazing.

00:32:52.480 --> 00:32:54.920 align:middle line:84%
You just have to point to
what happened after this.

00:32:54.920 --> 00:32:57.390 align:middle line:90%
And he did have a proper--

00:32:57.390 --> 00:32:58.190 align:middle line:90%
well, not British.

00:32:58.190 --> 00:32:59.420 align:middle line:90%
Scottish education.

00:32:59.420 --> 00:33:00.220 align:middle line:90%
Right?

00:33:00.220 --> 00:33:01.020 align:middle line:90%
>> GREENE: Yeah.

00:33:01.020 --> 00:33:02.020 align:middle line:90%
Scottish Church College.

00:33:02.020 --> 00:33:04.228 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: English, economics,
and philosophy, right?

00:33:04.228 --> 00:33:05.090 align:middle line:90%
>> GREENE: Yeah.

00:33:05.090 --> 00:33:06.196 align:middle line:90%
Westernized.

00:33:06.196 --> 00:33:08.070 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: Much like
Gandhi's, Sri Aurobindo,

00:33:08.070 --> 00:33:09.050 align:middle line:90%
and a lot of them.

00:33:09.050 --> 00:33:11.591 align:middle line:84%
>> GREENE: And he was a Gandhi
man for the early years of his

00:33:11.591 --> 00:33:14.420 align:middle line:84%
life, up until the time
he met his guru in '22.

00:33:14.420 --> 00:33:16.580 align:middle line:84%
He was an [INAUDIBLE] He
was wearing khadi cloth

00:33:16.580 --> 00:33:19.850 align:middle line:84%
like the Gandhi followers, he'd
given up his college degree

00:33:19.850 --> 00:33:23.047 align:middle line:84%
since Gandhi had said let's
reject all British titles,

00:33:23.047 --> 00:33:24.880 align:middle line:84%
and he was an organizer
in his neighborhood.

00:33:24.880 --> 00:33:25.790 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: Peaceful
disobedience.

00:33:25.790 --> 00:33:26.706 align:middle line:90%
>> GREENE: Absolutely.

00:33:26.706 --> 00:33:29.240 align:middle line:84%
He was right there
with all of that.

00:33:29.240 --> 00:33:33.120 align:middle line:84%
When he started
studying with his guru

00:33:33.120 --> 00:33:37.940 align:middle line:84%
Bhaktisiddhanta Sarasvati,
what that happened for him--

00:33:37.940 --> 00:33:42.110 align:middle line:84%
and if you want to call it the
mission unfolding or some level

00:33:42.110 --> 00:33:46.430 align:middle line:84%
of consciousness coming to the
surface in the life of a divine

00:33:46.430 --> 00:33:50.180 align:middle line:84%
being, however you
wish to describe it,

00:33:50.180 --> 00:33:57.520 align:middle line:84%
all of a sudden, his
India-centric focus of a life

00:33:57.520 --> 00:34:00.950 align:middle line:84%
went global and he
saw the possibility

00:34:00.950 --> 00:34:06.740 align:middle line:84%
of bringing true spiritual
knowledge to the entire world,

00:34:06.740 --> 00:34:10.340 align:middle line:84%
and the idea of
re-spiritualizing humanity

00:34:10.340 --> 00:34:12.020 align:middle line:90%
became a reality for him.

00:34:12.020 --> 00:34:18.739 align:middle line:84%
I always ask myself what is
it that compels people to go

00:34:18.739 --> 00:34:22.219 align:middle line:84%
past the limits that
they set for themselves.

00:34:22.219 --> 00:34:27.820 align:middle line:84%
What is it that allows us to
do more than we think ourselves

00:34:27.820 --> 00:34:28.810 align:middle line:90%
capable of doing?

00:34:28.810 --> 00:34:29.610 align:middle line:90%
All right.

00:34:29.610 --> 00:34:30.902 align:middle line:90%
Let's put this in some context.

00:34:30.902 --> 00:34:31.701 align:middle line:90%
All right.

00:34:31.701 --> 00:34:33.850 align:middle line:84%
What are the basic
teachings of Bhagavad Gita?

00:34:33.850 --> 00:34:36.310 align:middle line:84%
The basic teachings
of the Gita are

00:34:36.310 --> 00:34:37.900 align:middle line:90%
that you are an eternal soul.

00:34:37.900 --> 00:34:40.300 align:middle line:84%
In this moment and
forever, you are divine.

00:34:40.300 --> 00:34:41.139 align:middle line:90%
You are beautiful.

00:34:41.139 --> 00:34:41.860 align:middle line:90%
You are perfect.

00:34:41.860 --> 00:34:42.679 align:middle line:90%
You are complete.

00:34:42.679 --> 00:34:43.870 align:middle line:90%
You lack for nothing.

00:34:43.870 --> 00:34:45.940 align:middle line:90%
No one can hurt you.

00:34:45.940 --> 00:34:46.870 align:middle line:90%
You're immortal.

00:34:46.870 --> 00:34:48.969 align:middle line:90%
You're an immortal being.

00:34:48.969 --> 00:34:52.436 align:middle line:84%
So what is it like
to live like that?

00:34:52.436 --> 00:34:54.560 align:middle line:84%
I mean, it's one thing to
intellectually, yeah, OK.

00:34:54.560 --> 00:34:55.120 align:middle line:90%
Yeah, I get it.

00:34:55.120 --> 00:34:55.690 align:middle line:90%
I'm a soul.

00:34:55.690 --> 00:34:56.739 align:middle line:90%
I'm an eternal soul.

00:34:56.739 --> 00:34:58.255 align:middle line:90%
Imagine living like that.

00:34:58.255 --> 00:35:00.870 align:middle line:90%


00:35:00.870 --> 00:35:03.690 align:middle line:90%
You can live like that.

00:35:03.690 --> 00:35:06.780 align:middle line:84%
Consciousness may be
covered over right now.

00:35:06.780 --> 00:35:10.150 align:middle line:84%
For example, Gil brought
me here in his car.

00:35:10.150 --> 00:35:13.830 align:middle line:84%
If he left his car in the
parking lot of Gaia TV

00:35:13.830 --> 00:35:15.990 align:middle line:90%
for a week, it'd get filthy.

00:35:15.990 --> 00:35:19.350 align:middle line:84%
Cover it with dust, if it
rains, there'd be mud, you know.

00:35:19.350 --> 00:35:22.500 align:middle line:84%
Just by being in the material
world, things get covered.

00:35:22.500 --> 00:35:25.890 align:middle line:84%
That's true of
consciousness as well.

00:35:25.890 --> 00:35:28.920 align:middle line:84%
We don't recall ourselves
as spiritual beings

00:35:28.920 --> 00:35:31.170 align:middle line:84%
because we've taken
so many births

00:35:31.170 --> 00:35:33.680 align:middle line:90%
that we've forgotten that.

00:35:33.680 --> 00:35:36.050 align:middle line:84%
The yoga practices,
the spiritual practices

00:35:36.050 --> 00:35:39.300 align:middle line:84%
do not impose
anything new on us.

00:35:39.300 --> 00:35:44.020 align:middle line:84%
They reawaken something that's
already been there forever.

00:35:44.020 --> 00:35:46.540 align:middle line:84%
So it's a return of memory,
which is interesting

00:35:46.540 --> 00:35:48.540 align:middle line:84%
because there are parallels
in Holocaust studies

00:35:48.540 --> 00:35:51.030 align:middle line:84%
as well of the
return of traumatized

00:35:51.030 --> 00:35:52.010 align:middle line:90%
or suppressed memory.

00:35:52.010 --> 00:35:54.640 align:middle line:90%


00:35:54.640 --> 00:35:57.120 align:middle line:84%
The chanting of the Krishna
mantra is for that purpose.

00:35:57.120 --> 00:36:01.752 align:middle line:84%
It's to revitalize our knowledge
of ourselves as divine beings.

00:36:01.752 --> 00:36:04.630 align:middle line:90%


00:36:04.630 --> 00:36:06.520 align:middle line:84%
Imagine how
liberating that would

00:36:06.520 --> 00:36:09.370 align:middle line:84%
be to live like that,
knowing yourself

00:36:09.370 --> 00:36:12.240 align:middle line:90%
to be that no one can hurt you.

00:36:12.240 --> 00:36:15.870 align:middle line:84%
If I know that you can't
hurt me, that frees me up,

00:36:15.870 --> 00:36:16.670 align:middle line:90%
doesn't it?

00:36:16.670 --> 00:36:18.740 align:middle line:84%
It means I can be here
and I can listen to you.

00:36:18.740 --> 00:36:20.720 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: You don't have
to be defensive, aggressive.

00:36:20.720 --> 00:36:21.590 align:middle line:90%
It's all gone.

00:36:21.590 --> 00:36:23.173 align:middle line:84%
>> GREENE: Don't
have to be defensive.

00:36:23.173 --> 00:36:24.650 align:middle line:90%
Don't have to be aggressive.

00:36:24.650 --> 00:36:27.870 align:middle line:84%
Don't have to be wondering,
what's in this for me.

00:36:27.870 --> 00:36:29.360 align:middle line:90%
You know, I can be here for you.

00:36:29.360 --> 00:36:33.680 align:middle line:84%
I can listen to you and respond
to you as a spiritual being.

00:36:33.680 --> 00:36:35.240 align:middle line:90%
What an amazing thing that is.

00:36:35.240 --> 00:36:37.100 align:middle line:90%
Why should I love you?

00:36:37.100 --> 00:36:39.680 align:middle line:84%
It's not because I've got
some lovely hallmark card that

00:36:39.680 --> 00:36:42.110 align:middle line:90%
says, oh, God's in your heart.

00:36:42.110 --> 00:36:45.780 align:middle line:84%
No, it's because you're
a soul just like I am,

00:36:45.780 --> 00:36:47.810 align:middle line:84%
and you're in that body
and contending with all

00:36:47.810 --> 00:36:51.890 align:middle line:84%
that that implies just
like I've been doing.

00:36:51.890 --> 00:36:56.810 align:middle line:84%
And so I get you a little
bit, and we're family.

00:36:56.810 --> 00:36:58.950 align:middle line:90%
I love you because we're family.

00:36:58.950 --> 00:37:02.982 align:middle line:84%
Now, what an amazing peace
formula that would be.

00:37:02.982 --> 00:37:04.940 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: And that's
where he was living from.

00:37:04.940 --> 00:37:06.273 align:middle line:90%
>> GREENE: That's exactly right.

00:37:06.273 --> 00:37:10.400 align:middle line:84%
He had come to this point,
studying under his guru,

00:37:10.400 --> 00:37:12.977 align:middle line:84%
really imbibing this
from childhood, you know,

00:37:12.977 --> 00:37:14.060 align:middle line:90%
that you are not the body.

00:37:14.060 --> 00:37:18.560 align:middle line:84%
You are an eternal soul,
where he saw the possibilities

00:37:18.560 --> 00:37:21.750 align:middle line:90%
of going global with this.

00:37:21.750 --> 00:37:24.050 align:middle line:90%
Wow.

00:37:24.050 --> 00:37:25.100 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Right.

00:37:25.100 --> 00:37:25.900 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:37:25.900 --> 00:37:26.700 align:middle line:90%
Oh my gosh.

00:37:26.700 --> 00:37:28.450 align:middle line:90%
What it took for him to do that.

00:37:28.450 --> 00:37:31.960 align:middle line:84%
So first of all, let's
get into his life.

00:37:31.960 --> 00:37:33.580 align:middle line:90%
He had to support himself.

00:37:33.580 --> 00:37:36.730 align:middle line:84%
Interestingly, he had
an arranged marriage,

00:37:36.730 --> 00:37:39.160 align:middle line:90%
but it was almost--

00:37:39.160 --> 00:37:41.380 align:middle line:84%
the idea initially was to
arrange a marriage that

00:37:41.380 --> 00:37:44.200 align:middle line:84%
wouldn't be just so
overpoweringly lovely that you

00:37:44.200 --> 00:37:48.560 align:middle line:84%
can't leave it when it's time
to heed the call of Krishna.

00:37:48.560 --> 00:37:49.510 align:middle line:90%
Right?

00:37:49.510 --> 00:37:50.385 align:middle line:90%
>> GREENE: Well said.

00:37:50.385 --> 00:37:52.110 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:37:52.110 --> 00:37:54.640 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: So he didn't have
huge inducements to throw his

00:37:54.640 --> 00:37:57.520 align:middle line:84%
life completely in that
way, into family life,

00:37:57.520 --> 00:37:59.710 align:middle line:90%
but he did have to provide.

00:37:59.710 --> 00:38:01.030 align:middle line:90%
He was a pharmacist.

00:38:01.030 --> 00:38:03.280 align:middle line:84%
>> GREENE: Yes, he was, and
a very responsible person.

00:38:03.280 --> 00:38:07.240 align:middle line:84%
I think that that
bears mentioning.

00:38:07.240 --> 00:38:10.240 align:middle line:84%
When I showed the original
manuscript for "Swami

00:38:10.240 --> 00:38:12.770 align:middle line:84%
in a Strange Land"
to my editor--

00:38:12.770 --> 00:38:14.380 align:middle line:84%
really wonderful
editor whom I've been

00:38:14.380 --> 00:38:16.720 align:middle line:90%
working with for a long time--

00:38:16.720 --> 00:38:19.750 align:middle line:84%
she said, you know, this
is a gripping story.

00:38:19.750 --> 00:38:24.930 align:middle line:84%
This is a really exciting story,
but there's one thing I just--

00:38:24.930 --> 00:38:29.320 align:middle line:84%
I love Prabhupada by reading
your biography of him,

00:38:29.320 --> 00:38:31.990 align:middle line:84%
but how could he have
ever left his family?

00:38:31.990 --> 00:38:33.700 align:middle line:90%
That was the one thing.

00:38:33.700 --> 00:38:35.360 align:middle line:90%
And not just Kyra--

00:38:35.360 --> 00:38:38.050 align:middle line:84%
Kyra Ryan is her name--
but others as well.

00:38:38.050 --> 00:38:39.190 align:middle line:90%
How could he ever do that?

00:38:39.190 --> 00:38:41.860 align:middle line:84%
And so I had to get
into that in the book.

00:38:41.860 --> 00:38:44.360 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: This is not uncommon
for activism on all levels,

00:38:44.360 --> 00:38:45.160 align:middle line:90%
though, in India.

00:38:45.160 --> 00:38:47.050 align:middle line:84%
Often, the family
was left behind

00:38:47.050 --> 00:38:49.420 align:middle line:84%
so the man fulfilled what
he felt his destiny was.

00:38:49.420 --> 00:38:50.220 align:middle line:90%
>> GREENE: Sure.

00:38:50.220 --> 00:38:53.020 align:middle line:84%
I remember one interview
with Nelson Mandela where

00:38:53.020 --> 00:38:55.270 align:middle line:84%
the reporter asked, is there
anything about your life

00:38:55.270 --> 00:38:56.500 align:middle line:90%
that you regret.

00:38:56.500 --> 00:38:57.300 align:middle line:90%
And he says, yeah.

00:38:57.300 --> 00:39:01.180 align:middle line:84%
I wish I'd spent more
time with my family.

00:39:01.180 --> 00:39:02.470 align:middle line:90%
That's a tough call.

00:39:02.470 --> 00:39:04.990 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: It's a tough call,
but he had a higher calling

00:39:04.990 --> 00:39:06.940 align:middle line:90%
than family in his heart.

00:39:06.940 --> 00:39:07.740 align:middle line:90%
>> GREENE: Yeah.

00:39:07.740 --> 00:39:11.830 align:middle line:84%
And it's important for you, and
me, and viewers, and everybody

00:39:11.830 --> 00:39:17.005 align:middle line:84%
to understand that there
is nothing incompatible--

00:39:17.005 --> 00:39:18.130 align:middle line:90%
this is an important thing.

00:39:18.130 --> 00:39:20.530 align:middle line:84%
Took me a long time
to understand this.

00:39:20.530 --> 00:39:24.130 align:middle line:84%
There is nothing incompatible
with living your life

00:39:24.130 --> 00:39:27.610 align:middle line:84%
and being a thoroughly
spiritual person.

00:39:27.610 --> 00:39:33.400 align:middle line:84%
Marriage, children,
job, responsibilities,

00:39:33.400 --> 00:39:35.240 align:middle line:90%
Little League, whatever.

00:39:35.240 --> 00:39:36.040 align:middle line:90%
You know?

00:39:36.040 --> 00:39:38.320 align:middle line:84%
You know, there is
nothing inherently

00:39:38.320 --> 00:39:40.990 align:middle line:90%
unspiritual about any of that.

00:39:40.990 --> 00:39:44.140 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: Some would argue more
so, because it takes so much

00:39:44.140 --> 00:39:47.650 align:middle line:84%
more to stay in a state of
awareness, and consciousness,

00:39:47.650 --> 00:39:51.040 align:middle line:84%
and devotion amidst real life
than to sequester yourself,

00:39:51.040 --> 00:39:53.047 align:middle line:84%
which is the easier
path in many views.

00:39:53.047 --> 00:39:54.880 align:middle line:84%
>> GREENE: Well, you've
just put your finger

00:39:54.880 --> 00:39:58.840 align:middle line:84%
on Prabhupada's core teaching,
which was stay where you are

00:39:58.840 --> 00:40:01.480 align:middle line:90%
and see Krishna in the details.

00:40:01.480 --> 00:40:04.480 align:middle line:84%
See God in the details of
the life you already have.

00:40:04.480 --> 00:40:06.335 align:middle line:84%
Don't go off coveting
some life that you--

00:40:06.335 --> 00:40:07.210 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: In a cave.

00:40:07.210 --> 00:40:08.010 align:middle line:90%
Right.

00:40:08.010 --> 00:40:10.180 align:middle line:84%
>> GREENE: --wish to
have or don't have.

00:40:10.180 --> 00:40:12.190 align:middle line:84%
All the tools of
your enlightenment

00:40:12.190 --> 00:40:15.520 align:middle line:84%
have already been provided
in the life you have now.

00:40:15.520 --> 00:40:17.710 align:middle line:84%
Just acknowledge them and
be appreciative for what

00:40:17.710 --> 00:40:18.510 align:middle line:90%
you've got.

00:40:18.510 --> 00:40:19.780 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Very true.

00:40:19.780 --> 00:40:24.080 align:middle line:84%
>> GREENE: Now, that's tough
when your situation is painful.

00:40:24.080 --> 00:40:25.790 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: His was painful.

00:40:25.790 --> 00:40:28.150 align:middle line:84%
But he was also-- he was
living both realities,

00:40:28.150 --> 00:40:29.920 align:middle line:90%
but in an extreme way.

00:40:29.920 --> 00:40:32.830 align:middle line:84%
I mean, as I understand,
by this time,

00:40:32.830 --> 00:40:35.080 align:middle line:84%
he was chanting
seven hours a day--

00:40:35.080 --> 00:40:36.970 align:middle line:90%
Hare Krishna seven hours a day.

00:40:36.970 --> 00:40:37.840 align:middle line:90%
>> GREENE: Yes.

00:40:37.840 --> 00:40:39.460 align:middle line:84%
And in that sense,
I think we have

00:40:39.460 --> 00:40:42.510 align:middle line:84%
to acknowledge there's
something extra human about him.

00:40:42.510 --> 00:40:43.310 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Yes.

00:40:43.310 --> 00:40:44.320 align:middle line:90%
Extra devoted.

00:40:44.320 --> 00:40:46.570 align:middle line:84%
>> GREENE: Something
unusual there.

00:40:46.570 --> 00:40:47.870 align:middle line:90%
He was one of a kind.

00:40:47.870 --> 00:40:48.670 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Yeah.

00:40:48.670 --> 00:40:50.620 align:middle line:84%
He was finding his
solace in that,

00:40:50.620 --> 00:40:52.720 align:middle line:84%
and his connection in
that, his motivation

00:40:52.720 --> 00:40:55.392 align:middle line:84%
in chanting Hare Krishna
seven hours a day.

00:40:55.392 --> 00:40:57.100 align:middle line:84%
>> GREENE: Can I tell
you a little story?

00:40:57.100 --> 00:40:57.520 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Mhmm.

00:40:57.520 --> 00:40:59.680 align:middle line:84%
>> GREENE: The first
time I met my teacher,

00:40:59.680 --> 00:41:04.450 align:middle line:84%
the first time I met Prabhupada,
I was all of 20 years old

00:41:04.450 --> 00:41:10.600 align:middle line:84%
or whatever, and I had been
initiated already for a year.

00:41:10.600 --> 00:41:13.540 align:middle line:84%
And the idea of
meeting him in person

00:41:13.540 --> 00:41:17.001 align:middle line:84%
was like, I'm a giddy
little school girl going

00:41:17.001 --> 00:41:19.250 align:middle line:90%
to meet my hero here.

00:41:19.250 --> 00:41:22.450 align:middle line:90%
And the first thing he said--

00:41:22.450 --> 00:41:27.160 align:middle line:84%
I ran back to the house that
was our temple outside Paris

00:41:27.160 --> 00:41:30.610 align:middle line:84%
and was the first one
there, so it was just him

00:41:30.610 --> 00:41:31.750 align:middle line:90%
and me in the house.

00:41:31.750 --> 00:41:34.030 align:middle line:84%
Him and his servant who
had driven him there.

00:41:34.030 --> 00:41:37.120 align:middle line:84%
And I hear from his
room, Yogesvara.

00:41:37.120 --> 00:41:38.980 align:middle line:90%
That's my spiritual name.

00:41:38.980 --> 00:41:44.200 align:middle line:84%
So I came running in and
offered my respects to him,

00:41:44.200 --> 00:41:47.500 align:middle line:84%
and he was sitting there
chanting on his beads.

00:41:47.500 --> 00:41:49.120 align:middle line:90%
His eyes were closed.

00:41:49.120 --> 00:41:50.500 align:middle line:84%
And the first
thing he said to me

00:41:50.500 --> 00:41:53.160 align:middle line:84%
was, you know, throughout
my entire life,

00:41:53.160 --> 00:41:55.690 align:middle line:90%
I have never forgotten Krishna.

00:41:55.690 --> 00:41:58.420 align:middle line:84%
He said, even when I was a
little boy, I had my dolls.

00:41:58.420 --> 00:42:00.304 align:middle line:84%
He called his Radha
Krishna deities dolls.

00:42:00.304 --> 00:42:01.720 align:middle line:84%
And he put his
hand out to show me

00:42:01.720 --> 00:42:06.790 align:middle line:84%
that they were a child's set
of Radha Krishna deities.

00:42:06.790 --> 00:42:10.330 align:middle line:84%
Why he chose that to be the
first thing that he would say

00:42:10.330 --> 00:42:14.380 align:middle line:84%
to me, I'm still meditating
on, but it was significant,

00:42:14.380 --> 00:42:16.090 align:middle line:84%
because what he
was doing, I think,

00:42:16.090 --> 00:42:20.660 align:middle line:84%
was reassuring me that
you can trust this

00:42:20.660 --> 00:42:21.980 align:middle line:90%
and you can trust me.

00:42:21.980 --> 00:42:23.840 align:middle line:90%
I'm never going to hurt you.

00:42:23.840 --> 00:42:27.020 align:middle line:84%
I have your spiritual
interests at heart.

00:42:27.020 --> 00:42:30.440 align:middle line:84%
My whole life has been
Krishna conscious,

00:42:30.440 --> 00:42:31.850 align:middle line:90%
and I have no other interests.

00:42:31.850 --> 00:42:35.480 align:middle line:90%
I have no selfish motive here.

00:42:35.480 --> 00:42:37.810 align:middle line:90%
That's a rare soul.

00:42:37.810 --> 00:42:39.200 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Indeed.

00:42:39.200 --> 00:42:44.300 align:middle line:84%
So at this point, let's
go back a little bit.

00:42:44.300 --> 00:42:50.380 align:middle line:84%
He was devoted to the higher
principles of the Bhagavad

00:42:50.380 --> 00:42:51.180 align:middle line:90%
Gita.

00:42:51.180 --> 00:42:51.980 align:middle line:90%
Right?

00:42:51.980 --> 00:42:55.350 align:middle line:84%
And was it called the
Bhagavatam that was, he said,

00:42:55.350 --> 00:42:57.050 align:middle line:90%
is a post-doctoral course--

00:42:57.050 --> 00:42:58.758 align:middle line:84%
>> GREENE: Oh, you've
done your homework.

00:42:58.758 --> 00:43:00.120 align:middle line:90%
This is great.

00:43:00.120 --> 00:43:02.940 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: --in these teachings
which took everything to a much

00:43:02.940 --> 00:43:04.860 align:middle line:90%
higher, almost cosmic level.

00:43:04.860 --> 00:43:07.200 align:middle line:84%
And I bring that up, if you
can expand on that a bit,

00:43:07.200 --> 00:43:10.410 align:middle line:84%
so we can go into this
deep concern, which

00:43:10.410 --> 00:43:13.590 align:middle line:84%
is true of many
people, even now,

00:43:13.590 --> 00:43:16.655 align:middle line:84%
about the Kali Yuga and
implications of the Kali Yuga

00:43:16.655 --> 00:43:17.455 align:middle line:90%
stage.

00:43:17.455 --> 00:43:17.850 align:middle line:90%
&Gt;> GREENE: OK.

00:43:17.850 --> 00:43:18.150 align:middle line:90%
Wow.

00:43:18.150 --> 00:43:19.400 align:middle line:90%
That's a mouthful right there.

00:43:19.400 --> 00:43:22.230 align:middle line:90%


00:43:22.230 --> 00:43:24.870 align:middle line:84%
They're the basics
of spiritual life.

00:43:24.870 --> 00:43:27.300 align:middle line:84%
You know, nonviolence,
compassion

00:43:27.300 --> 00:43:32.670 align:middle line:84%
for others, a healthy diet,
keep your nose clean literally

00:43:32.670 --> 00:43:34.290 align:middle line:90%
and metaphorically.

00:43:34.290 --> 00:43:37.020 align:middle line:84%
Don't get involved
with activities

00:43:37.020 --> 00:43:39.810 align:middle line:84%
that are contrary to
your spiritual interests.

00:43:39.810 --> 00:43:40.800 align:middle line:90%
Keep good company.

00:43:40.800 --> 00:43:43.950 align:middle line:84%
I mean, these are
all very foundational

00:43:43.950 --> 00:43:48.330 align:middle line:84%
behavioral guidelines for
healthy spiritual life.

00:43:48.330 --> 00:43:50.010 align:middle line:90%
Where does that take you?

00:43:50.010 --> 00:43:51.560 align:middle line:90%
You go to yoga classes.

00:43:51.560 --> 00:43:52.360 align:middle line:90%
Right?

00:43:52.360 --> 00:43:53.160 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:43:53.160 --> 00:43:54.790 align:middle line:90%
So now you're all mellow.

00:43:54.790 --> 00:43:56.290 align:middle line:84%
First of all, how
long does it last?

00:43:56.290 --> 00:43:57.690 align:middle line:90%
Usually about 10 minutes.

00:43:57.690 --> 00:44:00.570 align:middle line:84%
You leave the yoga studio and
wham, Kali Yuga's right back.

00:44:00.570 --> 00:44:03.070 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: Someone just
cuts you off on the road.

00:44:03.070 --> 00:44:04.840 align:middle line:90%
&Gt;> GREENE: Road rage ready.

00:44:04.840 --> 00:44:07.300 align:middle line:84%
So the question is, how
do you sustain that.

00:44:07.300 --> 00:44:09.280 align:middle line:84%
How do you go into
Savasana and maintain

00:44:09.280 --> 00:44:13.870 align:middle line:84%
that sense of peacefulness
throughout the day?

00:44:13.870 --> 00:44:17.020 align:middle line:84%
That requires study and it
requires deeper knowledge

00:44:17.020 --> 00:44:20.290 align:middle line:84%
of the philosophy behind
yoga and other spiritual

00:44:20.290 --> 00:44:22.480 align:middle line:90%
disciplines.

00:44:22.480 --> 00:44:23.890 align:middle line:90%
Again, going back to 101.

00:44:23.890 --> 00:44:24.760 align:middle line:90%
You're not the body.

00:44:24.760 --> 00:44:25.870 align:middle line:90%
You're an eternal soul.

00:44:25.870 --> 00:44:28.030 align:middle line:90%
What is the nature of spirit?

00:44:28.030 --> 00:44:29.920 align:middle line:84%
What is the nature
of that consciousness

00:44:29.920 --> 00:44:32.110 align:middle line:90%
that animates your body?

00:44:32.110 --> 00:44:33.970 align:middle line:84%
The foundations of
that understanding

00:44:33.970 --> 00:44:35.590 align:middle line:84%
are in the Bhagavad
Gita, which is

00:44:35.590 --> 00:44:39.580 align:middle line:84%
the core essential
text of Bhakti

00:44:39.580 --> 00:44:41.830 align:middle line:90%
culture, devotional culture.

00:44:41.830 --> 00:44:43.690 align:middle line:84%
When you've mastered
those basics

00:44:43.690 --> 00:44:46.060 align:middle line:84%
and these things become
second nature for you,

00:44:46.060 --> 00:44:49.090 align:middle line:84%
you're no longer struggling
with staying away from alcohol,

00:44:49.090 --> 00:44:50.610 align:middle line:90%
and drugs, or whatever.

00:44:50.610 --> 00:44:54.800 align:middle line:84%
You're staying in a
different kind of high now.

00:44:54.800 --> 00:44:57.350 align:middle line:84%
George Harrison once said
in order to go higher,

00:44:57.350 --> 00:44:58.960 align:middle line:90%
you have to stop getting high.

00:44:58.960 --> 00:45:01.150 align:middle line:84%
There's a nice
way of putting it.

00:45:01.150 --> 00:45:03.400 align:middle line:84%
The postgraduate study
of the Bhagavad Gita

00:45:03.400 --> 00:45:06.350 align:middle line:90%
is called the Srimad Bhagavatam.

00:45:06.350 --> 00:45:08.470 align:middle line:84%
It's also known as
the Bhagavata Purana.

00:45:08.470 --> 00:45:11.990 align:middle line:84%
The Puranas are the histories
not only of this universe,

00:45:11.990 --> 00:45:13.700 align:middle line:90%
but other universes.

00:45:13.700 --> 00:45:17.620 align:middle line:84%
Prabhupada's life mission was
translating and commenting

00:45:17.620 --> 00:45:21.370 align:middle line:84%
these books for us
here in the West,

00:45:21.370 --> 00:45:25.150 align:middle line:84%
in America, in
Europe, in Asia so

00:45:25.150 --> 00:45:28.750 align:middle line:84%
that these millennial
teachings would

00:45:28.750 --> 00:45:33.160 align:middle line:84%
be understandable in
the context of the life

00:45:33.160 --> 00:45:35.410 align:middle line:90%
we know, the world we live in.

00:45:35.410 --> 00:45:37.390 align:middle line:90%
That was his brilliant gift.

00:45:37.390 --> 00:45:40.630 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: And to critical
acclaim of all kinds.

00:45:40.630 --> 00:45:43.060 align:middle line:84%
His translations, apparently,
are just almost flawless.

00:45:43.060 --> 00:45:46.060 align:middle line:84%
>> GREENE: They're
standard in courses,

00:45:46.060 --> 00:45:49.270 align:middle line:84%
university courses
and yoga studios.

00:45:49.270 --> 00:45:51.100 align:middle line:84%
These are now the
standard texts.

00:45:51.100 --> 00:45:55.250 align:middle line:84%
The Bhaktivedanta commentaries
on the Isha Upanishad,

00:45:55.250 --> 00:45:59.230 align:middle line:90%
Bhagavad Gita, the Bhagavatam.

00:45:59.230 --> 00:46:03.570 align:middle line:84%
These are now the standard
references for those texts.

00:46:03.570 --> 00:46:06.040 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: And they
came at a great price.

00:46:06.040 --> 00:46:09.400 align:middle line:84%
This man up at 3:00
and 4:00 in the morning

00:46:09.400 --> 00:46:14.110 align:middle line:84%
hand writing this year,
after year, after year,

00:46:14.110 --> 00:46:17.280 align:middle line:84%
after year, and scraping
together pennies

00:46:17.280 --> 00:46:19.200 align:middle line:90%
to have even one volume printed.

00:46:19.200 --> 00:46:22.360 align:middle line:84%
I mean, the dedication
is probably--

00:46:22.360 --> 00:46:24.760 align:middle line:84%
I don't know that I've
ever read a story of anyone

00:46:24.760 --> 00:46:27.700 align:middle line:84%
more dedicated to
a single theme.

00:46:27.700 --> 00:46:30.730 align:middle line:84%
>> GREENE: People ask, when
you wrote "Swami in a Strange

00:46:30.730 --> 00:46:33.700 align:middle line:84%
Land," were there
any real surprises.

00:46:33.700 --> 00:46:35.680 align:middle line:84%
That was maybe one of
the biggest for me was,

00:46:35.680 --> 00:46:42.010 align:middle line:84%
I had not understood the
depth of his sacrifice for me.

00:46:42.010 --> 00:46:46.090 align:middle line:84%
For us to have gone through
what he went through,

00:46:46.090 --> 00:46:54.310 align:middle line:84%
to translate, comment these
books, beg, save, scrimp.

00:46:54.310 --> 00:46:55.690 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: For a few rupees.

00:46:55.690 --> 00:46:59.480 align:middle line:84%
>> GREENE: To get a little money
to go buy paper during war time

00:46:59.480 --> 00:47:03.100 align:middle line:84%
India where these things were
rationed so that he could print

00:47:03.100 --> 00:47:05.950 align:middle line:84%
these books, so that when
he got on that boat to come

00:47:05.950 --> 00:47:10.350 align:middle line:84%
to America, he would have
something to substantiate his

00:47:10.350 --> 00:47:12.720 align:middle line:84%
teachings that people
would understand.

00:47:12.720 --> 00:47:14.070 align:middle line:90%
He had not invented this.

00:47:14.070 --> 00:47:16.920 align:middle line:84%
This is traditional
knowledge going back

00:47:16.920 --> 00:47:19.320 align:middle line:90%
before recorded history.

00:47:19.320 --> 00:47:21.370 align:middle line:84%
I had not understood
how great that sacrif--

00:47:21.370 --> 00:47:23.880 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: Well, I found
that really just shocking,

00:47:23.880 --> 00:47:27.000 align:middle line:84%
because this went on, well,
not for just a few years.

00:47:27.000 --> 00:47:29.370 align:middle line:90%
Not even just a few decades.

00:47:29.370 --> 00:47:31.620 align:middle line:84%
As he struggled to keep
his business afloat,

00:47:31.620 --> 00:47:34.329 align:middle line:84%
finally, he had to
separate from his family

00:47:34.329 --> 00:47:36.870 align:middle line:84%
because the moment came where
he had to devote his life fully

00:47:36.870 --> 00:47:40.560 align:middle line:84%
to this body of work that he
had really made available,

00:47:40.560 --> 00:47:44.310 align:middle line:84%
and now, I think, because
we have some time left,

00:47:44.310 --> 00:47:48.907 align:middle line:84%
but I don't want to ignore
this, he's almost 70 years old--

00:47:48.907 --> 00:47:50.740 align:middle line:84%
>> GREENE: Yeah, at
this point in the story.

00:47:50.740 --> 00:47:53.280 align:middle line:84%
&Gt;> REGINA: When he finally
got a ticket and clearances

00:47:53.280 --> 00:47:54.180 align:middle line:90%
to go to America.

00:47:54.180 --> 00:47:54.390 align:middle line:90%
>> GREENE: Yeah.

00:47:54.390 --> 00:47:55.549 align:middle line:90%
It was 1965.

00:47:55.549 --> 00:47:57.090 align:middle line:84%
&Gt;> REGINA: And
he got the message.

00:47:57.090 --> 00:48:00.000 align:middle line:84%
He received the message from
Sarasvati when he was 26.

00:48:00.000 --> 00:48:04.200 align:middle line:84%
It took till he was 70 to get it
together and make that journey.

00:48:04.200 --> 00:48:08.040 align:middle line:90%
>> GREENE: He calculated.

00:48:08.040 --> 00:48:13.210 align:middle line:84%
Who goes to America without
money, at my age especially?

00:48:13.210 --> 00:48:14.460 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: He was feeling old.

00:48:14.460 --> 00:48:17.010 align:middle line:90%
>> GREENE: He was 70 years old.

00:48:17.010 --> 00:48:19.267 align:middle line:90%
So everyone's discouraging him.

00:48:19.267 --> 00:48:20.100 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: And poor.

00:48:20.100 --> 00:48:20.610 align:middle line:90%
Very poor.

00:48:20.610 --> 00:48:21.609 align:middle line:90%
&Gt;> GREENE: Very poor.

00:48:21.609 --> 00:48:25.380 align:middle line:84%
When he became a
renunciant in 1959,

00:48:25.380 --> 00:48:28.710 align:middle line:84%
that meant giving up all
attachment to business,

00:48:28.710 --> 00:48:32.890 align:middle line:84%
moneymaking ventures, rarely
seeing family, having no fixed

00:48:32.890 --> 00:48:33.690 align:middle line:90%
residence.

00:48:33.690 --> 00:48:36.750 align:middle line:84%
You constantly travel to teach
for the benefit of others.

00:48:36.750 --> 00:48:40.540 align:middle line:90%


00:48:40.540 --> 00:48:44.080 align:middle line:84%
It finally became clear, through
dreams, in large measure,

00:48:44.080 --> 00:48:47.860 align:middle line:84%
that he had to
just go and really

00:48:47.860 --> 00:48:52.960 align:middle line:84%
just completely throw himself
on God's mercy and Krishna's

00:48:52.960 --> 00:48:55.090 align:middle line:90%
grace.

00:48:55.090 --> 00:48:56.912 align:middle line:84%
I don't know how he
got on that boat.

00:48:56.912 --> 00:48:58.120 align:middle line:90%
&Gt;> REGINA: I don't either.

00:48:58.120 --> 00:49:02.887 align:middle line:84%
I mean, he got on it, though,
and he had heart failure.

00:49:02.887 --> 00:49:04.095 align:middle line:90%
>> GREENE: Two heart attacks.

00:49:04.095 --> 00:49:04.795 align:middle line:90%
&Gt;> REGINA: Two heart attacks.

00:49:04.795 --> 00:49:05.230 align:middle line:90%
&Gt;> GREENE: On the way over.

00:49:05.230 --> 00:49:07.104 align:middle line:84%
&Gt;> REGINA: On the
trip, right off the bat.

00:49:07.104 --> 00:49:09.037 align:middle line:84%
Sick to his stomach
on these roiling seas.

00:49:09.037 --> 00:49:10.120 align:middle line:90%
&Gt;> GREENE: Nearly died.

00:49:10.120 --> 00:49:11.470 align:middle line:90%
&Gt;> REGINA: Nearly died.

00:49:11.470 --> 00:49:13.980 align:middle line:84%
And got to New
York city and said,

00:49:13.980 --> 00:49:16.425 align:middle line:84%
oy, why did you send
me to this awful place.

00:49:16.425 --> 00:49:18.175 align:middle line:84%
>> GREENE: I don't
know about the oy part,

00:49:18.175 --> 00:49:19.383 align:middle line:90%
but it's the right sentiment.

00:49:19.383 --> 00:49:20.770 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: That's for you.

00:49:20.770 --> 00:49:23.270 align:middle line:84%
>> GREENE: This is what Campbell
would have called the belly

00:49:23.270 --> 00:49:25.240 align:middle line:84%
of the whale, the
point of no return.

00:49:25.240 --> 00:49:27.610 align:middle line:90%
There's no turning back now.

00:49:27.610 --> 00:49:29.230 align:middle line:90%
He's left India.

00:49:29.230 --> 00:49:33.000 align:middle line:84%
He's crossed the
ocean at age 70.

00:49:33.000 --> 00:49:35.740 align:middle line:84%
Most people are setting
up their folding chairs

00:49:35.740 --> 00:49:38.200 align:middle line:90%
on Collins Avenue in Miami.

00:49:38.200 --> 00:49:41.340 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: And he had $8,
an umbrella, a suitcase,

00:49:41.340 --> 00:49:42.700 align:middle line:90%
and his books.

00:49:42.700 --> 00:49:44.820 align:middle line:84%
>> GREENE: That's it,
and a bag of cereal.

00:49:44.820 --> 00:49:45.220 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: And cereal.

00:49:45.220 --> 00:49:45.820 align:middle line:84%
&Gt;> GREENE:
Because he thought,

00:49:45.820 --> 00:49:47.770 align:middle line:84%
if I can't find
anything else to eat,

00:49:47.770 --> 00:49:51.460 align:middle line:84%
I'll mix this with water
and have a few pancakes.

00:49:51.460 --> 00:49:54.470 align:middle line:90%
So he gets off the boat.

00:49:54.470 --> 00:49:56.860 align:middle line:90%
You have to imagine the scene.

00:49:56.860 --> 00:49:59.230 align:middle line:84%
And this is the
belly of the beast.

00:49:59.230 --> 00:50:01.490 align:middle line:90%
New York, 1965.

00:50:01.490 --> 00:50:02.290 align:middle line:90%
Right?

00:50:02.290 --> 00:50:06.070 align:middle line:90%
It's a chaotic world here.

00:50:06.070 --> 00:50:08.320 align:middle line:84%
Turning to the left,
turning to the right,

00:50:08.320 --> 00:50:10.000 align:middle line:84%
not knowing where
to go, where these--

00:50:10.000 --> 00:50:10.840 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: The
times of "Mad Men."

00:50:10.840 --> 00:50:11.690 align:middle line:90%
You know, Madison Avenue.

00:50:11.690 --> 00:50:12.410 align:middle line:90%
>> GREENE: This crazy.

00:50:12.410 --> 00:50:13.020 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Crazy materialism.

00:50:13.020 --> 00:50:13.500 align:middle line:90%
>> GREENE: Yeah.

00:50:13.500 --> 00:50:14.680 align:middle line:90%
It's the "Mad Men" era.

00:50:14.680 --> 00:50:15.220 align:middle line:90%
Exactly right.

00:50:15.220 --> 00:50:15.640 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: "Mad Men" era.

00:50:15.640 --> 00:50:15.760 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:50:15.760 --> 00:50:17.760 align:middle line:84%
>> GREENE: So all of this
advertising, you know,

00:50:17.760 --> 00:50:20.860 align:middle line:84%
miniskirts, hippies,
the whole thing.

00:50:20.860 --> 00:50:24.430 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: Women are
smoking along with the men.

00:50:24.430 --> 00:50:26.360 align:middle line:90%
>> GREENE: And what does he do?

00:50:26.360 --> 00:50:30.220 align:middle line:90%
He starts chanting.

00:50:30.220 --> 00:50:32.650 align:middle line:90%
How's that for a game plan?

00:50:32.650 --> 00:50:36.370 align:middle line:84%
Sits down on the grass next
to the sign that says keep off

00:50:36.370 --> 00:50:41.190 align:middle line:84%
the grass in the park in New
York City and starts chanting,

00:50:41.190 --> 00:50:42.150 align:middle line:90%
Hare Krishna.

00:50:42.150 --> 00:50:42.950 align:middle line:90%
Hare Krishna.

00:50:42.950 --> 00:50:44.350 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: Well, that's
all he knew to do,

00:50:44.350 --> 00:50:45.790 align:middle line:84%
and that's what he
was there to do.

00:50:45.790 --> 00:50:46.590 align:middle line:90%
>> GREENE: He knew.

00:50:46.590 --> 00:50:53.200 align:middle line:84%
Well, he had a faith that
surpasseth understanding.

00:50:53.200 --> 00:50:55.090 align:middle line:84%
He knew that this
was going to happen.

00:50:55.090 --> 00:50:58.390 align:middle line:90%
It had been prophesized that--

00:50:58.390 --> 00:51:00.910 align:middle line:84%
there had been predictions
that the chanting

00:51:00.910 --> 00:51:04.585 align:middle line:84%
would be heard worldwide for
hundreds and hundreds of years.

00:51:04.585 --> 00:51:06.210 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: And temples
would be built--

00:51:06.210 --> 00:51:07.150 align:middle line:84%
>> GREENE: There would
be temples worldwide.

00:51:07.150 --> 00:51:08.230 align:middle line:84%
&Gt;> REGINA: --throughout
the West devoted to it.

00:51:08.230 --> 00:51:10.270 align:middle line:84%
>> GREENE: So at
a certain point,

00:51:10.270 --> 00:51:14.290 align:middle line:84%
I think he must have understood
that God has chosen me

00:51:14.290 --> 00:51:17.620 align:middle line:84%
to fulfill these ancient
processes that the chanting

00:51:17.620 --> 00:51:20.031 align:middle line:84%
of the names of Krishna
would go worldwide.

00:51:20.031 --> 00:51:22.030 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: And Sarasvati
must've known that too.

00:51:22.030 --> 00:51:24.670 align:middle line:84%
&Gt;> GREENE: Bhaktisiddhanta
Sarasvati understood,

00:51:24.670 --> 00:51:27.850 align:middle line:84%
and he had asked other students
to go to the west and none

00:51:27.850 --> 00:51:30.400 align:middle line:90%
of them had had much success.

00:51:30.400 --> 00:51:35.050 align:middle line:84%
And in Prabhupada, I
think, he found his vehicle

00:51:35.050 --> 00:51:36.539 align:middle line:90%
for that mission.

00:51:36.539 --> 00:51:37.580 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: So he arrives.

00:51:37.580 --> 00:51:39.970 align:middle line:90%
He has one kind of contact.

00:51:39.970 --> 00:51:43.300 align:middle line:84%
>> GREENE: Sort of a
contact is a Dr. Mishra,

00:51:43.300 --> 00:51:45.760 align:middle line:84%
later known as
Brahmananda Sarasvati--

00:51:45.760 --> 00:51:47.320 align:middle line:90%
he's passed away now--

00:51:47.320 --> 00:51:50.710 align:middle line:84%
who was one of the early
yoga teachers in America.

00:51:50.710 --> 00:51:55.330 align:middle line:84%
Had a yoga studio
up in the west '70s

00:51:55.330 --> 00:51:58.786 align:middle line:84%
and was happy to find a
fellow Bengali and a teacher.

00:51:58.786 --> 00:52:01.060 align:middle line:84%
They had their
philosophic differences,

00:52:01.060 --> 00:52:05.090 align:middle line:84%
but he asked Prabhupada to lead
the chanting for his students,

00:52:05.090 --> 00:52:05.920 align:middle line:90%
and eventually--

00:52:05.920 --> 00:52:06.850 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: His yoga classes.

00:52:06.850 --> 00:52:07.060 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:52:07.060 --> 00:52:08.020 align:middle line:84%
&Gt;> GREENE: And the
yoga classes there.

00:52:08.020 --> 00:52:08.820 align:middle line:90%
Exactly.

00:52:08.820 --> 00:52:13.510 align:middle line:84%
And eventually, Prabhupada
developed his own followers,

00:52:13.510 --> 00:52:15.940 align:middle line:84%
and they found a little
place down on the Lower East

00:52:15.940 --> 00:52:19.210 align:middle line:84%
Side, which was the first
Krishna temple in the world

00:52:19.210 --> 00:52:20.380 align:middle line:90%
outside of India.

00:52:20.380 --> 00:52:22.480 align:middle line:90%
26 2nd Avenue.

00:52:22.480 --> 00:52:26.772 align:middle line:84%
And he had classes there,
and there's that funny story

00:52:26.772 --> 00:52:28.480 align:middle line:84%
that you and I were
talking about earlier

00:52:28.480 --> 00:52:30.400 align:middle line:90%
about the drunkards who--

00:52:30.400 --> 00:52:33.130 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: See, I loved that
story for a couple of reasons.

00:52:33.130 --> 00:52:37.090 align:middle line:84%
And he had a little group
of young people, like you,

00:52:37.090 --> 00:52:41.740 align:middle line:84%
but in New York prior to you,
who were really taken with what

00:52:41.740 --> 00:52:43.440 align:middle line:90%
he was trying to project.

00:52:43.440 --> 00:52:45.210 align:middle line:84%
And so they started
following him.

00:52:45.210 --> 00:52:46.210 align:middle line:90%
They were wearing robes.

00:52:46.210 --> 00:52:49.390 align:middle line:84%
They invited others in,
and little gatherings

00:52:49.390 --> 00:52:50.480 align:middle line:90%
were happening.

00:52:50.480 --> 00:52:54.070 align:middle line:84%
And at one of these
gatherings, a drunk man just

00:52:54.070 --> 00:52:55.697 align:middle line:90%
stumbled in off the streets.

00:52:55.697 --> 00:52:57.280 align:middle line:84%
>> GREENE: Stumbles
in off the street.

00:52:57.280 --> 00:52:58.390 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: All, you
know, disheveled.

00:52:58.390 --> 00:52:58.800 align:middle line:90%
>> GREENE: Smelly.

00:52:58.800 --> 00:52:59.920 align:middle line:90%
&Gt;> REGINA: Smelly.

00:52:59.920 --> 00:53:00.410 align:middle line:90%
>> GREENE: It was like-- yeah.

00:53:00.410 --> 00:53:01.015 align:middle line:90%
&Gt;> REGINA: It was like whoa.

00:53:01.015 --> 00:53:01.570 align:middle line:90%
What's going on?

00:53:01.570 --> 00:53:03.280 align:middle line:84%
>> GREENE: Basically, you
know, your typical New Yorker,

00:53:03.280 --> 00:53:04.450 align:middle line:90%
basically.

00:53:04.450 --> 00:53:07.582 align:middle line:84%
And he kind of
weaves his way over

00:53:07.582 --> 00:53:09.040 align:middle line:84%
to Prabhupada,
who's sitting at one

00:53:09.040 --> 00:53:11.500 align:middle line:84%
end of this tiny little
storefront location

00:53:11.500 --> 00:53:16.810 align:middle line:84%
where he gave class and wanted
to give a gift of some kind

00:53:16.810 --> 00:53:17.920 align:middle line:90%
to the Swami.

00:53:17.920 --> 00:53:23.950 align:middle line:84%
So from the coat pocket, whips
out this bag of toilet paper

00:53:23.950 --> 00:53:29.020 align:middle line:84%
and plunks it down on the podium
where Prabhupada is lecturing,

00:53:29.020 --> 00:53:32.500 align:middle line:84%
and he stumbles back and plops
himself down in the room,

00:53:32.500 --> 00:53:36.130 align:middle line:84%
and promptly falls
asleep against the wall.

00:53:36.130 --> 00:53:39.180 align:middle line:84%
And Prabhupada,
without missing a beat,

00:53:39.180 --> 00:53:40.900 align:middle line:84%
says to the few
people who were there

00:53:40.900 --> 00:53:43.870 align:middle line:84%
in those days for
classes, just see.

00:53:43.870 --> 00:53:49.750 align:middle line:84%
Surface to others is the nature,
the Dharma of all beings.

00:53:49.750 --> 00:53:52.540 align:middle line:84%
This fellow may not be in
order, but he was thinking,

00:53:52.540 --> 00:53:54.610 align:middle line:90%
let me give some service.

00:53:54.610 --> 00:53:56.020 align:middle line:90%
He said, there it is.

00:53:56.020 --> 00:53:57.430 align:middle line:90%
Custom made for the class.

00:53:57.430 --> 00:53:59.410 align:middle line:90%
And he started another Kirtan.

00:53:59.410 --> 00:54:03.502 align:middle line:84%
This guy wakes up, stands
up and starts dancing.

00:54:03.502 --> 00:54:04.302 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Right.

00:54:04.302 --> 00:54:06.250 align:middle line:90%
Dancing around and chanting.

00:54:06.250 --> 00:54:08.770 align:middle line:84%
>> GREENE: And chanting
with the devotees.

00:54:08.770 --> 00:54:12.430 align:middle line:84%
And came back
about a week later,

00:54:12.430 --> 00:54:22.530 align:middle line:84%
clean shaven, fresh clothing,
sober as morning dew,

00:54:22.530 --> 00:54:26.100 align:middle line:84%
intoxicated by this
new kind of ecstasy

00:54:26.100 --> 00:54:29.160 align:middle line:84%
that he discovered with
Prabhupada and Krishna

00:54:29.160 --> 00:54:30.660 align:middle line:90%
consciousness.

00:54:30.660 --> 00:54:33.060 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: And as you
comment in the book,

00:54:33.060 --> 00:54:34.460 align:middle line:90%
a new type of intoxication.

00:54:34.460 --> 00:54:35.930 align:middle line:90%
>> GREENE: New kind, yes.

00:54:35.930 --> 00:54:37.250 align:middle line:90%
&Gt;> REGINA: For this man.

00:54:37.250 --> 00:54:39.190 align:middle line:84%
And to see that,
of his own accord,

00:54:39.190 --> 00:54:41.130 align:middle line:84%
this happened so
quickly that his spirit

00:54:41.130 --> 00:54:43.770 align:middle line:84%
was speaking to him in
this way, such a profound

00:54:43.770 --> 00:54:44.700 align:middle line:90%
and quick manner.

00:54:44.700 --> 00:54:49.620 align:middle line:84%
>> GREENE: It doesn't have to
take grueling, mind-searing,

00:54:49.620 --> 00:54:53.277 align:middle line:84%
gut-rending decades to
achieve enlightenment.

00:54:53.277 --> 00:54:54.360 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: No, not at all.

00:54:54.360 --> 00:54:55.693 align:middle line:90%
&Gt;> GREENE: It really doesn't.

00:54:55.693 --> 00:54:57.810 align:middle line:84%
&Gt;> REGINA: Well, so
now he is starting to--

00:54:57.810 --> 00:55:00.700 align:middle line:84%
"Village Voice" is talking
about the arrival of the Swami,

00:55:00.700 --> 00:55:01.500 align:middle line:90%
right?

00:55:01.500 --> 00:55:02.010 align:middle line:90%
And now--

00:55:02.010 --> 00:55:02.820 align:middle line:90%
>> GREENE: Picked up fast.

00:55:02.820 --> 00:55:03.720 align:middle line:84%
&Gt;> REGINA: Yeah,
picked up fast.

00:55:03.720 --> 00:55:04.270 align:middle line:90%
>> GREENE: Picked up very fast.

00:55:04.270 --> 00:55:06.910 align:middle line:84%
&Gt;> REGINA: People of profile
are starting to about it Allen

00:55:06.910 --> 00:55:07.710 align:middle line:90%
Ginsberg.

00:55:07.710 --> 00:55:09.168 align:middle line:84%
>> GREENE: Allen
Ginsberg shows up.

00:55:09.168 --> 00:55:13.270 align:middle line:84%
And Ginsberg had been to India
already some years before

00:55:13.270 --> 00:55:16.710 align:middle line:84%
and had seen the chanting of the
Krishna mantra in the streets,

00:55:16.710 --> 00:55:19.980 align:middle line:84%
so he was familiar with that
already and had been chanting.

00:55:19.980 --> 00:55:22.530 align:middle line:84%
He was on the Alan
Burke TV show.

00:55:22.530 --> 00:55:25.650 align:middle line:84%
Burke was kind of like the
Johnny Carson of his day.

00:55:25.650 --> 00:55:28.931 align:middle line:84%
And would chant wherever
he would have poetry.

00:55:28.931 --> 00:55:31.180 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: Did he go on
William F. Buckley's show too?

00:55:31.180 --> 00:55:32.400 align:middle line:84%
&Gt;> GREENE: He was
on the Buckley show.

00:55:32.400 --> 00:55:33.774 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: Chanting
Hare Krishna.

00:55:33.774 --> 00:55:34.950 align:middle line:90%
Which, can you imagine that?

00:55:34.950 --> 00:55:38.730 align:middle line:84%
I would love to see that
segment with William Buckley.

00:55:38.730 --> 00:55:40.847 align:middle line:84%
I can't even fathom
what that was like.

00:55:40.847 --> 00:55:42.930 align:middle line:84%
>> GREENE: Interesting
chanting, you've got there.

00:55:42.930 --> 00:55:45.360 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: Well, he certainly
propelled the notion of it

00:55:45.360 --> 00:55:45.990 align:middle line:90%
to the mainstream.

00:55:45.990 --> 00:55:46.790 align:middle line:90%
>> GREENE: He did.

00:55:46.790 --> 00:55:48.630 align:middle line:84%
&Gt;> REGINA: Via
these media outlets.

00:55:48.630 --> 00:55:50.250 align:middle line:84%
>> GREENE: Ginsberg
was an important,

00:55:50.250 --> 00:55:52.760 align:middle line:84%
influential person
in those days.

00:55:52.760 --> 00:55:56.100 align:middle line:84%
Of course, he was kind of the
doyen of the hippie poetry

00:55:56.100 --> 00:55:57.210 align:middle line:90%
world.

00:55:57.210 --> 00:56:01.230 align:middle line:84%
And so he came to see Prabhupada
and gave him a harmonium,

00:56:01.230 --> 00:56:02.730 align:middle line:84%
which is how I got
started as well,

00:56:02.730 --> 00:56:05.460 align:middle line:84%
which was playing this
little keyboard instrument.

00:56:05.460 --> 00:56:08.940 align:middle line:84%
And whenever Ginsberg
had public events,

00:56:08.940 --> 00:56:12.140 align:middle line:84%
he would chant the
Krishna mantra.

00:56:12.140 --> 00:56:13.680 align:middle line:90%
It was picked up by musicians.

00:56:13.680 --> 00:56:14.580 align:middle line:90%
I mean, you have to remember--

00:56:14.580 --> 00:56:15.621 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: John Coltrane.

00:56:15.621 --> 00:56:18.630 align:middle line:84%
&Gt;> GREENE: Coltrane had three
albums where he thanked mantra

00:56:18.630 --> 00:56:22.650 align:middle line:84%
meditation, and India, and yoga
for kind of weaning him off

00:56:22.650 --> 00:56:23.565 align:middle line:90%
of drug abuse.

00:56:23.565 --> 00:56:25.811 align:middle line:90%


00:56:25.811 --> 00:56:27.810 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: And then, of
course, George Harrison.

00:56:27.810 --> 00:56:29.760 align:middle line:84%
>> GREENE: Then George came
along and the whole thing

00:56:29.760 --> 00:56:30.130 align:middle line:90%
exploded.

00:56:30.130 --> 00:56:31.020 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: Now, the
whole thing's exploding.

00:56:31.020 --> 00:56:31.895 align:middle line:90%
>> GREENE: That's it.

00:56:31.895 --> 00:56:34.740 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: And now you have this
album out with Hare Krishna,

00:56:34.740 --> 00:56:38.970 align:middle line:84%
and people, teenagers, you know,
and young people all around

00:56:38.970 --> 00:56:41.010 align:middle line:84%
the country and world
listening to this.

00:56:41.010 --> 00:56:45.430 align:middle line:84%
>> GREENE: Well, you know,
God works in strange ways,

00:56:45.430 --> 00:56:47.970 align:middle line:84%
and he can work through
the Beatles as well.

00:56:47.970 --> 00:56:51.510 align:middle line:84%
So when George started chanting
and the Beatles went to India,

00:56:51.510 --> 00:56:53.820 align:middle line:90%
that was the game changer.

00:56:53.820 --> 00:56:59.250 align:middle line:84%
That's when things-- because
the whole post-war baby boomers,

00:56:59.250 --> 00:57:02.126 align:middle line:84%
as we were called, looked to
the Beatles and realized that,

00:57:02.126 --> 00:57:03.750 align:middle line:84%
all of a sudden, if
they're doing this,

00:57:03.750 --> 00:57:08.640 align:middle line:84%
there's got to be something here
in this chanting and in yoga.

00:57:08.640 --> 00:57:11.125 align:middle line:84%
Prior to that time,
say early '60s,

00:57:11.125 --> 00:57:12.750 align:middle line:84%
you could have opened
up any newspaper.

00:57:12.750 --> 00:57:14.670 align:middle line:84%
There wasn't one ad
for a yoga class.

00:57:14.670 --> 00:57:15.562 align:middle line:90%
There was no yoga.

00:57:15.562 --> 00:57:16.362 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: No.

00:57:16.362 --> 00:57:16.806 align:middle line:90%
No, there wasn't.

00:57:16.806 --> 00:57:17.250 align:middle line:90%
&Gt;> GREENE: It wasn't there.

00:57:17.250 --> 00:57:19.259 align:middle line:84%
So this was very cutting
edge stuff back then.

00:57:19.259 --> 00:57:20.300 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: It really was.

00:57:20.300 --> 00:57:22.400 align:middle line:84%
And with this pickup
with the yoga,

00:57:22.400 --> 00:57:24.660 align:middle line:84%
with the music and
everything, now it's

00:57:24.660 --> 00:57:26.835 align:middle line:84%
starting to sift into
everyone's consciousness,

00:57:26.835 --> 00:57:27.960 align:middle line:90%
whether you know it or not.

00:57:27.960 --> 00:57:30.480 align:middle line:84%
You're listening to a pop
station, Hare Krishna's

00:57:30.480 --> 00:57:33.420 align:middle line:84%
playing, you know, as you say,
with some beats and all that.

00:57:33.420 --> 00:57:35.070 align:middle line:84%
And you just start
humming along.

00:57:35.070 --> 00:57:38.640 align:middle line:84%
And so we only have literally
a couple minutes left.

00:57:38.640 --> 00:57:40.380 align:middle line:84%
We've had such a
delightful conversation.

00:57:40.380 --> 00:57:41.760 align:middle line:90%
The time has flown.

00:57:41.760 --> 00:57:42.610 align:middle line:90%
But let's talk.

00:57:42.610 --> 00:57:44.730 align:middle line:84%
Let's do the epilogue
from this point.

00:57:44.730 --> 00:57:47.040 align:middle line:84%
It's made it into the
mass consciousness,

00:57:47.040 --> 00:57:49.770 align:middle line:84%
with resistance or
not with the people.

00:57:49.770 --> 00:57:53.560 align:middle line:84%
But nonetheless, the
prophecy was fulfilled.

00:57:53.560 --> 00:57:54.360 align:middle line:90%
>> GREENE: Yeah.

00:57:54.360 --> 00:57:55.160 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Right?

00:57:55.160 --> 00:57:56.640 align:middle line:90%
&Gt;> GREENE: Yeah, it was.

00:57:56.640 --> 00:58:00.030 align:middle line:84%
&Gt;> REGINA: Hundreds
or more than 100 temples?

00:58:00.030 --> 00:58:02.672 align:middle line:84%
>> GREENE: So
there's 650 temples.

00:58:02.672 --> 00:58:03.630 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: 650 temples.

00:58:03.630 --> 00:58:05.463 align:middle line:84%
&Gt;> GREENE: Krishna
temples now worldwide.

00:58:05.463 --> 00:58:08.990 align:middle line:84%
110 vegetarian
restaurants, farms.

00:58:08.990 --> 00:58:13.040 align:middle line:84%
And perhaps as significant,
if not more so, for me,

00:58:13.040 --> 00:58:15.590 align:middle line:84%
the penetration of
consciousness studies

00:58:15.590 --> 00:58:18.290 align:middle line:90%
into the fields of science--

00:58:18.290 --> 00:58:21.620 align:middle line:90%
neurology, cosmology, physics--

00:58:21.620 --> 00:58:27.230 align:middle line:84%
I think, is the long term
impact of Prabhupada's mission.

00:58:27.230 --> 00:58:31.670 align:middle line:84%
He would never have
claimed exclusive credit

00:58:31.670 --> 00:58:33.320 align:middle line:84%
for any of that,
but certainly he

00:58:33.320 --> 00:58:37.850 align:middle line:84%
did a mammoth job of
pushing forward the notion

00:58:37.850 --> 00:58:41.660 align:middle line:84%
that you, and I, and
everyone watching this

00:58:41.660 --> 00:58:44.870 align:middle line:84%
is an eternal spiritual being,
that consciousness is not

00:58:44.870 --> 00:58:50.540 align:middle line:84%
the product of chemistry in the
brain, interactions of forces

00:58:50.540 --> 00:58:52.500 align:middle line:84%
and subatomic
particles, that you

00:58:52.500 --> 00:58:54.980 align:middle line:84%
were something that existed
before this body came

00:58:54.980 --> 00:58:56.510 align:middle line:90%
into existence.

00:58:56.510 --> 00:58:59.420 align:middle line:84%
You will continue to exist
after this body can no

00:58:59.420 --> 00:59:01.520 align:middle line:90%
longer maintain consciousness.

00:59:01.520 --> 00:59:03.320 align:middle line:90%
You are eternal.

00:59:03.320 --> 00:59:06.320 align:middle line:84%
That will be, I believe,
the long term benefit.

00:59:06.320 --> 00:59:08.480 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: I think so as well.

00:59:08.480 --> 00:59:11.870 align:middle line:84%
And all these fields of study
have popped up around it.

00:59:11.870 --> 00:59:14.450 align:middle line:84%
The work of Michael Cremo, for
example, has popped up too.

00:59:14.450 --> 00:59:15.205 align:middle line:90%
>> GREENE: An old friend.

00:59:15.205 --> 00:59:16.005 align:middle line:90%
&Gt;> REGINA: Yes.

00:59:16.005 --> 00:59:18.140 align:middle line:90%
I would assume that.

00:59:18.140 --> 00:59:22.610 align:middle line:84%
And in essence, putting the
rigorous Western scientific

00:59:22.610 --> 00:59:26.720 align:middle line:84%
rigor to spirituality
and finding that,

00:59:26.720 --> 00:59:28.769 align:middle line:84%
while it can't be
completely explained--

00:59:28.769 --> 00:59:31.060 align:middle line:84%
they're looking in the fields
of dark matter as spirit,

00:59:31.060 --> 00:59:32.900 align:middle line:90%
for example--

00:59:32.900 --> 00:59:35.810 align:middle line:84%
its being displayed, and it's
more understood than ever

00:59:35.810 --> 00:59:41.030 align:middle line:84%
that there's something grander
that creates and inspires,

00:59:41.030 --> 00:59:42.830 align:middle line:90%
that transcends this.

00:59:42.830 --> 00:59:47.030 align:middle line:10%
>> GREENE: That's what gets me
up every morning is that vision

00:59:47.030 --> 00:59:53.690 align:middle line:10%
of a purposeful, beneficent
universe that reflects

00:59:53.690 --> 01:00:00.300 align:middle line:10%
the beauty, the artistry,
the creative sensitivity

01:00:00.300 --> 01:00:02.280 align:middle line:10%
of the creator.

01:00:02.280 --> 01:00:03.090 align:middle line:90%
He and she.

01:00:03.090 --> 01:00:06.480 align:middle line:90%


01:00:06.480 --> 01:00:08.309 align:middle line:90%
Brings tears to my eyes.

01:00:08.309 --> 01:00:09.850 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: And I
can understand that.

01:00:09.850 --> 01:00:12.420 align:middle line:84%
That's the beauty of
life and the possibility

01:00:12.420 --> 01:00:15.330 align:middle line:84%
of a really beautiful
life even here on Earth.

01:00:15.330 --> 01:00:16.380 align:middle line:90%
Especially here on Earth.

01:00:16.380 --> 01:00:18.510 align:middle line:90%
This is a special place.

01:00:18.510 --> 01:00:19.600 align:middle line:90%
You did a beautiful job.

01:00:19.600 --> 01:00:22.950 align:middle line:84%
I just have to thank you for
all the work you did on the book

01:00:22.950 --> 01:00:26.410 align:middle line:84%
to really bring his
life to light, and all

01:00:26.410 --> 01:00:29.550 align:middle line:90%
your own journalistic rigor.

01:00:29.550 --> 01:00:31.200 align:middle line:90%
>> GREENE: Thank you very much.

01:00:31.200 --> 01:00:33.780 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: Again, the name of
the book is "Swami in a Strange

01:00:33.780 --> 01:00:34.170 align:middle line:90%
Land."

01:00:34.170 --> 01:00:35.820 align:middle line:10%
It's a fascinating
look into the life

01:00:35.820 --> 01:00:39.390 align:middle line:10%
of an incredibly patient,
faith-filled, and devotional

01:00:39.390 --> 01:00:40.350 align:middle line:10%
human being.

01:00:40.350 --> 01:00:42.390 align:middle line:10%
Until next time, thank
you for joining us here

01:00:42.390 --> 01:00:44.930 align:middle line:10%
on "Open Minds."

01:00:44.930 --> 01:00:50.667 align:middle line:90%
