>> REGINA MEREDITH: How would
it sound to move from suffering

00:00:31.010 --> 00:00:32.090 align:middle line:10%
to grace?

00:00:32.090 --> 00:00:34.040 align:middle line:10%
Grace is a word that
is emerging more

00:00:34.040 --> 00:00:37.144 align:middle line:10%
as we become more aware that we
are not on this journey alone,

00:00:37.144 --> 00:00:39.560 align:middle line:10%
and there are forces aligned
with us, including our higher

00:00:39.560 --> 00:00:41.690 align:middle line:10%
self, to move us through life.

00:00:41.690 --> 00:00:45.020 align:middle line:10%
Tiffany Barsotti is here to
speak about moving into grace

00:00:45.020 --> 00:00:46.350 align:middle line:10%
as we grow through life.

00:00:46.350 --> 00:00:47.850 align:middle line:84%
It's good to see
you again, Tiffany.

00:00:47.850 --> 00:00:48.940 align:middle line:84%
>> TIFFANY BARSOTTI: You
too, thank you so much.

00:00:48.940 --> 00:00:50.900 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: It's been a few
years since our last interview,

00:00:50.900 --> 00:00:51.700 align:middle line:90%
right?

00:00:51.700 --> 00:00:55.340 align:middle line:84%
In the last one, we really got
into more of what, I think,

00:00:55.340 --> 00:00:59.120 align:middle line:84%
your dissertation
work was at one point,

00:00:59.120 --> 00:01:03.650 align:middle line:84%
and this incredibly beautiful
and complex understanding

00:01:03.650 --> 00:01:09.580 align:middle line:84%
of how the quantum field of
consciousness, as I recall it,

00:01:09.580 --> 00:01:12.800 align:middle line:84%
joins in through the
physical really through part

00:01:12.800 --> 00:01:14.450 align:middle line:90%
of the limbic system.

00:01:14.450 --> 00:01:15.830 align:middle line:90%
Was that part of it?

00:01:15.830 --> 00:01:18.050 align:middle line:84%
You refresh us on what--
so people can kind of get

00:01:18.050 --> 00:01:20.466 align:middle line:84%
an idea of where we were before,
and they can also go back

00:01:20.466 --> 00:01:21.510 align:middle line:90%
and watch that interview.

00:01:21.510 --> 00:01:22.600 align:middle line:90%
It's been a long time.

00:01:22.600 --> 00:01:23.400 align:middle line:90%
>> BARSOTTI: Yeah.

00:01:23.400 --> 00:01:26.750 align:middle line:84%
I think it was towards the
end of 2015 when it came out.

00:01:26.750 --> 00:01:27.860 align:middle line:90%
So, yeah.

00:01:27.860 --> 00:01:31.430 align:middle line:10%
I'm saying that there's a nexus
to this body-mind connection

00:01:31.430 --> 00:01:35.390 align:middle line:10%
as a way of knowing our higher
self and knowing spirit,

00:01:35.390 --> 00:01:38.030 align:middle line:10%
and the collection of
that is the vagus nerve,

00:01:38.030 --> 00:01:40.880 align:middle line:10%
this little-known chakra
called the alta major,

00:01:40.880 --> 00:01:42.920 align:middle line:10%
and the reticular
activating system,

00:01:42.920 --> 00:01:45.200 align:middle line:10%
that just all happen
to line up nicely

00:01:45.200 --> 00:01:47.210 align:middle line:10%
right in the back
of the head, right

00:01:47.210 --> 00:01:50.590 align:middle line:10%
at the occipital ridge
area in that little divot.

00:01:50.590 --> 00:01:51.390 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Yes.

00:01:51.390 --> 00:01:54.239 align:middle line:84%
>> BARSOTTI: So this is an
area that's really interesting.

00:01:54.239 --> 00:01:56.030 align:middle line:84%
Needs a lot more
research, because we still

00:01:56.030 --> 00:01:57.150 align:middle line:90%
can't see it on the fMRI.

00:01:57.150 --> 00:01:57.950 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: It does.

00:01:57.950 --> 00:02:00.560 align:middle line:84%
And more and more
researchers are coming out

00:02:00.560 --> 00:02:03.860 align:middle line:84%
with this kind of new and
mysterious understanding

00:02:03.860 --> 00:02:05.530 align:middle line:84%
of the function of
the vagus nerve.

00:02:05.530 --> 00:02:06.430 align:middle line:90%
>> BARSOTTI: Yeah.

00:02:06.430 --> 00:02:08.263 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: And talk a
little bit about that.

00:02:08.263 --> 00:02:11.270 align:middle line:84%
Because I hear it from
a lot of quarters now.

00:02:11.270 --> 00:02:13.130 align:middle line:84%
There's not a
consistent story yet,

00:02:13.130 --> 00:02:17.450 align:middle line:84%
but maybe you know of something
common to all the stories

00:02:17.450 --> 00:02:19.220 align:middle line:90%
that is emerging through this.

00:02:19.220 --> 00:02:21.506 align:middle line:84%
So tell us what
the vagus nerve is

00:02:21.506 --> 00:02:22.880 align:middle line:84%
and the stories
that are emerging

00:02:22.880 --> 00:02:25.760 align:middle line:84%
in your understanding of what
it actually is capable of.

00:02:25.760 --> 00:02:27.320 align:middle line:84%
>> BARSOTTI:
Beautiful, thank you.

00:02:27.320 --> 00:02:30.110 align:middle line:10%
It's a complex
system, because it's

00:02:30.110 --> 00:02:32.570 align:middle line:10%
known as the 10th cranial
nerve in the nervous system

00:02:32.570 --> 00:02:34.490 align:middle line:10%
that branches out
of the brain stem.

00:02:34.490 --> 00:02:37.970 align:middle line:84%
And what it's doing is wandering
all the way through the body.

00:02:37.970 --> 00:02:40.910 align:middle line:84%
It touches all the organs,
especially the heart

00:02:40.910 --> 00:02:42.140 align:middle line:90%
and the gut.

00:02:42.140 --> 00:02:45.350 align:middle line:84%
So some of the
recent research is

00:02:45.350 --> 00:02:48.140 align:middle line:84%
related both to
behavioral medicine,

00:02:48.140 --> 00:02:51.560 align:middle line:84%
like traumas and the
psychiatry and psyche,

00:02:51.560 --> 00:02:53.600 align:middle line:90%
but it's also in the microbiome.

00:02:53.600 --> 00:02:56.390 align:middle line:10%
And they're looking
at it as being

00:02:56.390 --> 00:03:00.500 align:middle line:10%
sort of the pathways
that connect

00:03:00.500 --> 00:03:05.330 align:middle line:10%
the gut-brain connection, and
how it is that we are actually

00:03:05.330 --> 00:03:08.390 align:middle line:10%
these efferent signals,
which means they go up

00:03:08.390 --> 00:03:11.510 align:middle line:10%
towards the brain, that it's
not just a one-way track,

00:03:11.510 --> 00:03:15.560 align:middle line:10%
as is often taught in
medical school 15 years ago.

00:03:15.560 --> 00:03:18.760 align:middle line:84%
So there's more
theory around that

00:03:18.760 --> 00:03:20.540 align:middle line:84%
now, as far as it being
a pathway, because

00:03:20.540 --> 00:03:23.180 align:middle line:84%
of all these efferent
signals, as well

00:03:23.180 --> 00:03:25.460 align:middle line:84%
as the polyvagal vagal
theory, which I love.

00:03:25.460 --> 00:03:28.820 align:middle line:10%
It's constantly being expanded
upon by Stephen Porges.

00:03:28.820 --> 00:03:32.030 align:middle line:10%
And he's really dealing with
this in the realm of psychiatry

00:03:32.030 --> 00:03:33.140 align:middle line:10%
and trauma.

00:03:33.140 --> 00:03:35.750 align:middle line:84%
And what we're
saying now about it--

00:03:35.750 --> 00:03:38.000 align:middle line:84%
and having a better
understanding--

00:03:38.000 --> 00:03:43.820 align:middle line:84%
is that we are truly wired,
naturally wired, for trust,

00:03:43.820 --> 00:03:46.690 align:middle line:90%
love, vulnerability, bliss.

00:03:46.690 --> 00:03:49.970 align:middle line:84%
Candace Pert's work taught
us that about the endorphins.

00:03:49.970 --> 00:03:51.740 align:middle line:84%
But we're really seeing
these nerve fibers

00:03:51.740 --> 00:03:53.990 align:middle line:84%
being able to tell us
so much more about,

00:03:53.990 --> 00:03:56.100 align:middle line:90%
this is truly who we really are.

00:03:56.100 --> 00:04:00.290 align:middle line:84%
So the vagus very reflexive
in that it's-- some would say

00:04:00.290 --> 00:04:02.820 align:middle line:84%
in the neural field
that it's plastic,

00:04:02.820 --> 00:04:06.360 align:middle line:84%
that we have the ability to wire
it the way that we need to wire

00:04:06.360 --> 00:04:07.160 align:middle line:90%
it.

00:04:07.160 --> 00:04:09.440 align:middle line:84%
Essentially, the whole
body can be rewired.

00:04:09.440 --> 00:04:13.100 align:middle line:84%
So as we step out of suffering,
and we step more and get off

00:04:13.100 --> 00:04:16.160 align:middle line:84%
the laws of karma and more
into the laws of grace,

00:04:16.160 --> 00:04:18.890 align:middle line:84%
then I think that that gives
us some hope with rewiring

00:04:18.890 --> 00:04:20.121 align:middle line:90%
our nervous system.

00:04:20.121 --> 00:04:21.079 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Interesting.

00:04:21.079 --> 00:04:23.680 align:middle line:84%
This is a total aside and
it's totally personal,

00:04:23.680 --> 00:04:26.495 align:middle line:84%
but through the years I would
go to my kinesiologist, who's

00:04:26.495 --> 00:04:29.980 align:middle line:84%
a brilliant kinesiologist,
leading-edge research and all.

00:04:29.980 --> 00:04:32.150 align:middle line:90%
And kind of had the same issues.

00:04:32.150 --> 00:04:33.211 align:middle line:90%
My body doesn't create--

00:04:33.211 --> 00:04:34.585 align:middle line:84%
it creates virtually
no cortisol.

00:04:34.585 --> 00:04:37.140 align:middle line:84%
It's a weird, very
strange birth defect.

00:04:37.140 --> 00:04:40.740 align:middle line:84%
And so the word that
kept coming up is,

00:04:40.740 --> 00:04:43.530 align:middle line:84%
he kept talking about the
involvement of the vagus nerve.

00:04:43.530 --> 00:04:44.960 align:middle line:90%
Well, this would involve--

00:04:44.960 --> 00:04:47.370 align:middle line:84%
I found, as the years
went on, I started seeing

00:04:47.370 --> 00:04:49.710 align:middle line:90%
the complex of events, myself.

00:04:49.710 --> 00:04:53.860 align:middle line:84%
And I saw even where fear
would change the outcome.

00:04:53.860 --> 00:04:57.000 align:middle line:84%
And the vagus
nerve was involved.

00:04:57.000 --> 00:04:58.890 align:middle line:84%
And fear because an
event was beginning

00:04:58.890 --> 00:05:02.070 align:middle line:84%
to happen which is
extreme, as long

00:05:02.070 --> 00:05:05.790 align:middle line:84%
as I could avoid any kind
of fear or emotional input

00:05:05.790 --> 00:05:09.240 align:middle line:84%
into the event, I
could actually have

00:05:09.240 --> 00:05:13.950 align:middle line:84%
it track a different direction,
which takes discipline,

00:05:13.950 --> 00:05:16.720 align:middle line:84%
because otherwise I'm lying
somewhere unconscious, right?

00:05:16.720 --> 00:05:19.155 align:middle line:90%
What's going on?

00:05:19.155 --> 00:05:21.700 align:middle line:84%
But that effects all the
way through to the guts.

00:05:21.700 --> 00:05:22.700 align:middle line:90%
>> BARSOTTI: Everywhere.

00:05:22.700 --> 00:05:26.610 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: Unconsciousness to
the guts to fear intersecting

00:05:26.610 --> 00:05:29.310 align:middle line:84%
control over emotions
in those moments.

00:05:29.310 --> 00:05:32.040 align:middle line:84%
Would that be something that
would fit the pattern of what

00:05:32.040 --> 00:05:35.880 align:middle line:84%
you're talking about, this
multidimensional pathway

00:05:35.880 --> 00:05:37.860 align:middle line:84%
that we're talking
about, the vagus nerve?

00:05:37.860 --> 00:05:39.277 align:middle line:90%
>> BARSOTTI: Absolutely, 100%.

00:05:39.277 --> 00:05:41.610 align:middle line:84%
And what you're demonstrating
in that that's so exciting

00:05:41.610 --> 00:05:44.040 align:middle line:84%
is how you've been
able to literally put

00:05:44.040 --> 00:05:46.230 align:middle line:90%
your mind elsewhere.

00:05:46.230 --> 00:05:49.230 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: Yeah, I can say,
I know this is happening,

00:05:49.230 --> 00:05:50.490 align:middle line:90%
it is not happening.

00:05:50.490 --> 00:05:53.580 align:middle line:84%
I'm not going to allow
this to continue happening.

00:05:53.580 --> 00:05:57.750 align:middle line:84%
Staying calm, calm,
cool and calm.

00:05:57.750 --> 00:05:59.320 align:middle line:90%
Knowing the drill.

00:05:59.320 --> 00:06:00.570 align:middle line:90%
I've been there so many times.

00:06:00.570 --> 00:06:03.060 align:middle line:84%
I know the drill,
and many times now,

00:06:03.060 --> 00:06:05.620 align:middle line:84%
I've been able to
stay conscious instead

00:06:05.620 --> 00:06:08.560 align:middle line:84%
of going unconscious by
not-- but as soon as I say,

00:06:08.560 --> 00:06:12.240 align:middle line:84%
oh, no, it's happening, the
fear floods the body and, boom,

00:06:12.240 --> 00:06:13.740 align:middle line:84%
it's a completely
different outcome.

00:06:13.740 --> 00:06:15.000 align:middle line:90%
>> BARSOTTI: Totally.

00:06:15.000 --> 00:06:16.060 align:middle line:90%
Good job.

00:06:16.060 --> 00:06:16.490 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Thank you.

00:06:16.490 --> 00:06:17.290 align:middle line:90%
Thank you.

00:06:17.290 --> 00:06:20.620 align:middle line:84%
Maybe I just needed validation
that I'm doing a good job.

00:06:20.620 --> 00:06:23.470 align:middle line:84%
No, but I'm saying, I
remember that because it

00:06:23.470 --> 00:06:24.720 align:middle line:90%
was all about the vagus nerve.

00:06:24.720 --> 00:06:25.500 align:middle line:90%
>> BARSOTTI: Yes.

00:06:25.500 --> 00:06:26.300 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

00:06:26.300 --> 00:06:28.456 align:middle line:84%
It's the communicative
web in the body.

00:06:28.456 --> 00:06:30.330 align:middle line:84%
The part that I'm also
interested in starting

00:06:30.330 --> 00:06:31.920 align:middle line:90%
to get into more and more--

00:06:31.920 --> 00:06:35.150 align:middle line:84%
and this is actually what
took me to graduate school.

00:06:35.150 --> 00:06:38.610 align:middle line:84%
I ended up in graduate
seminary, but--

00:06:38.610 --> 00:06:41.320 align:middle line:84%
I was really interested in
what the eyes are doing,

00:06:41.320 --> 00:06:43.860 align:middle line:84%
because the eyes are
only really connected

00:06:43.860 --> 00:06:46.020 align:middle line:84%
through the optic
nerve and fascia.

00:06:46.020 --> 00:06:48.370 align:middle line:84%
So there's so many
different types

00:06:48.370 --> 00:06:49.620 align:middle line:90%
of fascia throughout the body.

00:06:49.620 --> 00:06:54.570 align:middle line:84%
Well, that webbing, that's a
universal, ubiquitous component

00:06:54.570 --> 00:06:56.760 align:middle line:84%
to how our systems
are connected.

00:06:56.760 --> 00:06:58.900 align:middle line:90%
I mean, it's our outward skin.

00:06:58.900 --> 00:07:04.890 align:middle line:84%
One of my advisors for my
thesis is Clair Francomano

00:07:04.890 --> 00:07:09.330 align:middle line:84%
and her expertise is in
fascia, and she told me

00:07:09.330 --> 00:07:11.760 align:middle line:84%
during the process of defending
my thesis that there's

00:07:11.760 --> 00:07:14.400 align:middle line:84%
over 4,000 different
types of fascia.

00:07:14.400 --> 00:07:20.500 align:middle line:84%
So we have a huge way to go
here to have some understanding.

00:07:20.500 --> 00:07:24.270 align:middle line:84%
But I'm really interested
because when we see something--

00:07:24.270 --> 00:07:27.210 align:middle line:84%
if I see something-- but
even if you're not sighted,

00:07:27.210 --> 00:07:28.050 align:middle line:90%
you still sense.

00:07:28.050 --> 00:07:29.490 align:middle line:90%
You still have this--

00:07:29.490 --> 00:07:31.380 align:middle line:84%
you know what your
environment is.

00:07:31.380 --> 00:07:33.910 align:middle line:84%
We have receptors
that are very tuned.

00:07:33.910 --> 00:07:34.710 align:middle line:90%
You know?

00:07:34.710 --> 00:07:37.140 align:middle line:84%
I think that the latest
number is four billion bits

00:07:37.140 --> 00:07:41.040 align:middle line:84%
of information, is what
our field is processing,

00:07:41.040 --> 00:07:42.322 align:middle line:90%
whereas maybe--

00:07:42.322 --> 00:07:43.530 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: At any given time.

00:07:43.530 --> 00:07:44.610 align:middle line:90%
>> BARSOTTI: Yes.

00:07:44.610 --> 00:07:48.000 align:middle line:84%
The brain is only capable
of about 128 or something--

00:07:48.000 --> 00:07:50.434 align:middle line:84%
I don't know where
these numbers come from.

00:07:50.434 --> 00:07:51.600 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: It's interesting.

00:07:51.600 --> 00:07:53.070 align:middle line:84%
So what you're
really beginning--

00:07:53.070 --> 00:07:56.430 align:middle line:84%
you've seen a larger picture
emerge in all of this,

00:07:56.430 --> 00:07:59.010 align:middle line:84%
and we can no longer
afford the luxury

00:07:59.010 --> 00:08:04.530 align:middle line:84%
of thinking that the mind, the
body, the soul, the spirit,

00:08:04.530 --> 00:08:07.180 align:middle line:90%
the astral is separate.

00:08:07.180 --> 00:08:10.590 align:middle line:84%
There's nothing that's
separate from the other.

00:08:10.590 --> 00:08:13.650 align:middle line:84%
But this is now happening more
through the world of science.

00:08:13.650 --> 00:08:15.840 align:middle line:84%
The world of science
is validating it.

00:08:15.840 --> 00:08:20.099 align:middle line:10%
So after you went down
that road, you began--

00:08:20.099 --> 00:08:22.140 align:middle line:10%
some of the people that
have been your influences

00:08:22.140 --> 00:08:24.330 align:middle line:10%
are ones that I greatly
admire, and maybe you

00:08:24.330 --> 00:08:27.960 align:middle line:10%
can talk about the pieces that
the ancient Egyptian teachings

00:08:27.960 --> 00:08:31.950 align:middle line:10%
brought in, Sri Aurobindo, who
is lesser-known to many people,

00:08:31.950 --> 00:08:33.549 align:middle line:10%
Rudolf Steiner.

00:08:33.549 --> 00:08:35.880 align:middle line:10%
How they contributed to
this body of knowledge.

00:08:35.880 --> 00:08:39.270 align:middle line:84%
Because all of them
understood the depths

00:08:39.270 --> 00:08:41.159 align:middle line:90%
of our multi-dimensionality.

00:08:41.159 --> 00:08:43.350 align:middle line:90%
>> BARSOTTI: Absolutely.

00:08:43.350 --> 00:08:46.920 align:middle line:84%
These teachers
are other-worldly.

00:08:46.920 --> 00:08:50.970 align:middle line:84%
They're polymaths or
polyglots with their access

00:08:50.970 --> 00:08:54.810 align:middle line:84%
to information,
and I accidentally

00:08:54.810 --> 00:08:57.130 align:middle line:90%
stumbled on each of them.

00:08:57.130 --> 00:08:59.760 align:middle line:84%
So in some of my work when I
was at school-- and, you know,

00:08:59.760 --> 00:09:01.890 align:middle line:84%
it's the journey to
know thyself, right?

00:09:01.890 --> 00:09:05.430 align:middle line:84%
So much of the work I was doing
was really a lot on myself,

00:09:05.430 --> 00:09:08.260 align:middle line:84%
before we started
working on other people.

00:09:08.260 --> 00:09:11.970 align:middle line:84%
And I found that the
thoughts kept thinking me,

00:09:11.970 --> 00:09:13.680 align:middle line:84%
and I would be led
to Steiner's work,

00:09:13.680 --> 00:09:18.580 align:middle line:84%
or I would be led to the
ancient Egyptians' work, and Sri

00:09:18.580 --> 00:09:19.620 align:middle line:90%
Aurobindo, of course.

00:09:19.620 --> 00:09:23.090 align:middle line:84%
So the area of focus
where I have been

00:09:23.090 --> 00:09:26.830 align:middle line:84%
is looking at the subconscious
and unconscious realms.

00:09:26.830 --> 00:09:29.160 align:middle line:84%
So that takes us
into more modern day

00:09:29.160 --> 00:09:32.910 align:middle line:84%
of what Carl Jung and
Caroline Myss Eddinger,

00:09:32.910 --> 00:09:35.580 align:middle line:84%
and so many other people
have been talking about.

00:09:35.580 --> 00:09:37.530 align:middle line:84%
So that's more modern
time, but we have

00:09:37.530 --> 00:09:39.690 align:middle line:90%
these works to build off of.

00:09:39.690 --> 00:09:42.220 align:middle line:84%
So what really got
me so excited is

00:09:42.220 --> 00:09:45.100 align:middle line:84%
when I've been studying this
nature of the subconscious

00:09:45.100 --> 00:09:48.640 align:middle line:84%
selves and I was looking for,
what's the emanation of this?

00:09:48.640 --> 00:09:50.440 align:middle line:90%
Where were these coming from?

00:09:50.440 --> 00:09:53.950 align:middle line:10%
And I found roots of
it in ancient Egypt,

00:09:53.950 --> 00:09:59.380 align:middle line:10%
and they taught that there
were nine eyes of light.

00:09:59.380 --> 00:10:03.280 align:middle line:10%
And they each have their
names and sort of attributes

00:10:03.280 --> 00:10:05.950 align:middle line:10%
and the sort of the
segments within our field

00:10:05.950 --> 00:10:08.500 align:middle line:10%
that they are responsible for.

00:10:08.500 --> 00:10:11.560 align:middle line:84%
Steiner also said that
there were nine selves.

00:10:11.560 --> 00:10:14.590 align:middle line:84%
And Jesus's
teachings, he has said

00:10:14.590 --> 00:10:18.040 align:middle line:84%
that there are seven
mansions within my mansion.

00:10:18.040 --> 00:10:20.440 align:middle line:84%
Teresa of Avila,
The Interior Castle,

00:10:20.440 --> 00:10:22.300 align:middle line:90%
spoke of the seven levels.

00:10:22.300 --> 00:10:25.030 align:middle line:84%
Caroline Myss developed
her work even more.

00:10:25.030 --> 00:10:27.730 align:middle line:90%
So there's been this root.

00:10:27.730 --> 00:10:30.520 align:middle line:84%
And Sri Aurobindo spoke
of the many selves.

00:10:30.520 --> 00:10:34.220 align:middle line:84%
And he's got dedicated books
that the mother has written on

00:10:34.220 --> 00:10:35.410 align:middle line:90%
after his passing.

00:10:35.410 --> 00:10:36.210 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Yes.

00:10:36.210 --> 00:10:40.000 align:middle line:84%
>> BARSOTTI: So that takes
these teachings even further.

00:10:40.000 --> 00:10:42.800 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: And I think--

00:10:42.800 --> 00:10:44.950 align:middle line:84%
here I have this
one comment down,

00:10:44.950 --> 00:10:46.540 align:middle line:90%
it of falls into line with this.

00:10:46.540 --> 00:10:47.500 align:middle line:90%
It was Freud.

00:10:47.500 --> 00:10:50.740 align:middle line:84%
Freud said he was pessimistic
that people could actually

00:10:50.740 --> 00:10:53.770 align:middle line:84%
overcome the darkness
that crippled them

00:10:53.770 --> 00:10:55.117 align:middle line:90%
from the unconscious mind.

00:10:55.117 --> 00:10:56.950 align:middle line:84%
And here he's trying
to muck around and deal

00:10:56.950 --> 00:10:58.440 align:middle line:84%
with the unconscious
exclusively,

00:10:58.440 --> 00:11:00.220 align:middle line:90%
and he ends up a pessimist.

00:11:00.220 --> 00:11:01.770 align:middle line:90%
I don't think you can do it.

00:11:01.770 --> 00:11:02.750 align:middle line:90%
>> BARSOTTI: Exactly.

00:11:02.750 --> 00:11:03.550 align:middle line:90%
Exactly.

00:11:03.550 --> 00:11:05.560 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: And that's probably
because the lens he was looking

00:11:05.560 --> 00:11:07.690 align:middle line:84%
through didn't have the
tools to maybe understand

00:11:07.690 --> 00:11:12.850 align:middle line:84%
the multi-dimensionality, but
also the history of what feeds

00:11:12.850 --> 00:11:13.780 align:middle line:90%
the subconscious.

00:11:13.780 --> 00:11:16.360 align:middle line:84%
Because that requires a
buy-in on another level

00:11:16.360 --> 00:11:17.670 align:middle line:90%
he didn't really have.

00:11:17.670 --> 00:11:18.550 align:middle line:90%
>> BARSOTTI: No.

00:11:18.550 --> 00:11:21.320 align:middle line:84%
And people may hate
me for saying this,

00:11:21.320 --> 00:11:23.900 align:middle line:84%
but I actually don't think
that Freud did his own work.

00:11:23.900 --> 00:11:24.700 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Yeah.

00:11:24.700 --> 00:11:27.940 align:middle line:84%
>> BARSOTTI: So this
is something that--

00:11:27.940 --> 00:11:30.190 align:middle line:84%
we can look through it,
and I'm grateful for what

00:11:30.190 --> 00:11:33.312 align:middle line:84%
he has added to the body of
how we look at psychiatry

00:11:33.312 --> 00:11:35.020 align:middle line:84%
and psychology and
all of that, because I

00:11:35.020 --> 00:11:37.750 align:middle line:84%
think that we've really
had a lot to build off of.

00:11:37.750 --> 00:11:39.815 align:middle line:90%
However, it was incomplete.

00:11:39.815 --> 00:11:40.940 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Very incomplete.

00:11:40.940 --> 00:11:41.670 align:middle line:84%
>> BARSOTTI: As is
a lot of teachers.

00:11:41.670 --> 00:11:42.700 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: So it was
interesting that,

00:11:42.700 --> 00:11:44.830 align:middle line:84%
when all was said and done,
no, I don't think we can look

00:11:44.830 --> 00:11:45.630 align:middle line:90%
at it.

00:11:45.630 --> 00:11:47.830 align:middle line:84%
I don't think we can
do anything with this.

00:11:47.830 --> 00:11:48.790 align:middle line:90%
>> BARSOTTI: Exactly.

00:11:48.790 --> 00:11:51.910 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: And so in your work,
I mean, you work individually--

00:11:51.910 --> 00:11:54.095 align:middle line:84%
besides being a
lecturer and author,

00:11:54.095 --> 00:11:55.720 align:middle line:84%
you also work
individually with people,

00:11:55.720 --> 00:11:58.690 align:middle line:84%
so you have to take all of
these aspects of their being

00:11:58.690 --> 00:12:00.130 align:middle line:90%
into consideration.

00:12:00.130 --> 00:12:02.380 align:middle line:84%
So now we go into
the area that--

00:12:02.380 --> 00:12:04.150 align:middle line:84%
not so much for
our audience here,

00:12:04.150 --> 00:12:07.300 align:middle line:84%
we have a very
open-minded audience,

00:12:07.300 --> 00:12:09.670 align:middle line:84%
but still, some people
buck a bit, which

00:12:09.670 --> 00:12:13.000 align:middle line:84%
is the notion that the
unconscious or subconscious is

00:12:13.000 --> 00:12:15.520 align:middle line:84%
a repository for
everything that's been,

00:12:15.520 --> 00:12:18.160 align:middle line:84%
everything we have experienced
within our soul's journey.

00:12:18.160 --> 00:12:19.160 align:middle line:90%
>> BARSOTTI: Absolutely.

00:12:19.160 --> 00:12:23.324 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: So can you imagine
how much baggage that is?

00:12:23.324 --> 00:12:24.490 align:middle line:90%
>> BARSOTTI: A lot of stuff.

00:12:24.490 --> 00:12:27.550 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: Every life, every
event that has ever made its

00:12:27.550 --> 00:12:31.352 align:middle line:84%
imprint on us, those
pixels still carry forward,

00:12:31.352 --> 00:12:33.310 align:middle line:84%
even if we don't know
them and can't feel them.

00:12:33.310 --> 00:12:34.690 align:middle line:84%
You go ahead and
riff on this one.

00:12:34.690 --> 00:12:35.940 align:middle line:90%
>> BARSOTTI: Yeah, absolutely.

00:12:35.940 --> 00:12:36.880 align:middle line:90%
Thank you.

00:12:36.880 --> 00:12:38.440 align:middle line:90%
Pixels is a great word.

00:12:38.440 --> 00:12:41.980 align:middle line:84%
And when I find evidence
for-- and I've totally changed

00:12:41.980 --> 00:12:44.190 align:middle line:90%
my practice in the years.

00:12:44.190 --> 00:12:47.740 align:middle line:84%
It used to be that I was so was
dedicated into the past lives,

00:12:47.740 --> 00:12:52.180 align:middle line:84%
and what I found is that
there's a lot of, like, oh, I

00:12:52.180 --> 00:12:53.242 align:middle line:90%
have fear around that.

00:12:53.242 --> 00:12:55.450 align:middle line:84%
And so I just started calling
the majority of my work

00:12:55.450 --> 00:12:57.430 align:middle line:84%
emotional memory
therapy, because I

00:12:57.430 --> 00:12:59.680 align:middle line:84%
don't care where it
is that we find these,

00:12:59.680 --> 00:13:01.030 align:middle line:90%
because it doesn't matter.

00:13:01.030 --> 00:13:02.707 align:middle line:84%
If we happen to
land in a past life,

00:13:02.707 --> 00:13:04.540 align:middle line:84%
I hope that the person
that I'm working with

00:13:04.540 --> 00:13:06.880 align:middle line:84%
is open enough to continue
to go down that path,

00:13:06.880 --> 00:13:10.700 align:middle line:84%
because a lot gets resolved
if that's what happens.

00:13:10.700 --> 00:13:12.280 align:middle line:84%
But I don't feel
the need to open up

00:13:12.280 --> 00:13:18.160 align:middle line:84%
the book to all of that
documentary drama we've all

00:13:18.160 --> 00:13:19.340 align:middle line:90%
lived, right?

00:13:19.340 --> 00:13:21.880 align:middle line:84%
Couple of points here,
though, is that I really

00:13:21.880 --> 00:13:25.150 align:middle line:84%
feel that we have
this amalgamation

00:13:25.150 --> 00:13:30.310 align:middle line:84%
of, in our history-history, our
past, deep, distant history,

00:13:30.310 --> 00:13:31.630 align:middle line:90%
that is meant to inform us.

00:13:31.630 --> 00:13:34.630 align:middle line:84%
But it's also not supposed to
be this whole cascade that we

00:13:34.630 --> 00:13:36.100 align:middle line:90%
deal with all in this lifetime.

00:13:36.100 --> 00:13:37.210 align:middle line:90%
We've got enough.

00:13:37.210 --> 00:13:37.630 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Right.

00:13:37.630 --> 00:13:40.150 align:middle line:84%
>> BARSOTTI: But it is our high
self that I believe that has

00:13:40.150 --> 00:13:43.270 align:middle line:84%
aligned this group of
subconscious selves for this

00:13:43.270 --> 00:13:46.540 align:middle line:84%
lifetime, and this
sort of family dynamic,

00:13:46.540 --> 00:13:48.710 align:middle line:84%
this set of friends,
this social environment,

00:13:48.710 --> 00:13:52.750 align:middle line:84%
all of these sorts of things
that collectively create this

00:13:52.750 --> 00:13:54.790 align:middle line:90%
current experience.

00:13:54.790 --> 00:13:55.790 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Exactly.

00:13:55.790 --> 00:13:58.490 align:middle line:84%
There's a woman who
I've mentioned before,

00:13:58.490 --> 00:14:00.820 align:middle line:84%
who has been a
channeler in the past,

00:14:00.820 --> 00:14:04.300 align:middle line:84%
and whenever the beings were
speaking to the person sitting

00:14:04.300 --> 00:14:07.780 align:middle line:84%
before them, questions
had to be very specific,

00:14:07.780 --> 00:14:12.190 align:middle line:84%
the reason being here you have
who knows how many thousands

00:14:12.190 --> 00:14:14.920 align:middle line:84%
or millions of
pixels of events that

00:14:14.920 --> 00:14:17.230 align:middle line:84%
are within the
subconscious but beyond

00:14:17.230 --> 00:14:19.540 align:middle line:90%
below the cognizant level.

00:14:19.540 --> 00:14:24.430 align:middle line:84%
And they would say the
best question was always,

00:14:24.430 --> 00:14:27.160 align:middle line:84%
can you tell me any
information from the past

00:14:27.160 --> 00:14:30.730 align:middle line:84%
that is specifically
informing or directing me

00:14:30.730 --> 00:14:31.930 align:middle line:90%
in this lifetime?

00:14:31.930 --> 00:14:33.550 align:middle line:84%
And then the show
of pixels would all

00:14:33.550 --> 00:14:35.980 align:middle line:90%
narrow down to one or two.

00:14:35.980 --> 00:14:40.010 align:middle line:84%
This is the only thing relevant
in all of that bag of material

00:14:40.010 --> 00:14:41.420 align:middle line:90%
that is really--

00:14:41.420 --> 00:14:43.790 align:middle line:84%
you've come to work on
in this one lifetime.

00:14:43.790 --> 00:14:44.780 align:middle line:90%
>> BARSOTTI: Exactly.

00:14:44.780 --> 00:14:48.530 align:middle line:10%
And Dolores Cannon got
into that a little bit

00:14:48.530 --> 00:14:53.090 align:middle line:10%
towards the end of her
life, and it was still,

00:14:53.090 --> 00:14:54.830 align:middle line:10%
for the majority
of her career, she

00:14:54.830 --> 00:14:57.420 align:middle line:10%
was focused on what all
of these had to teach us.

00:14:57.420 --> 00:14:58.220 align:middle line:10%
>> REGINA: Right.

00:14:58.220 --> 00:15:00.440 align:middle line:10%
>> BARSOTTI: And so we have
those floodgates that can open

00:15:00.440 --> 00:15:01.240 align:middle line:10%
up like that.

00:15:01.240 --> 00:15:03.955 align:middle line:84%
I have not seen that do a whole
lot of service for people.

00:15:03.955 --> 00:15:05.330 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: Don't
need floodgates.

00:15:05.330 --> 00:15:06.130 align:middle line:90%
>> BARSOTTI: No.

00:15:06.130 --> 00:15:09.680 align:middle line:84%
Being more pinpointed in
where we go and how we do it.

00:15:09.680 --> 00:15:13.310 align:middle line:84%
And what I really find
is that the subconscious,

00:15:13.310 --> 00:15:16.640 align:middle line:84%
its prime directive is to
keep us healthy and alive,

00:15:16.640 --> 00:15:19.800 align:middle line:84%
so it's never going to bring up
anything that we can't handle.

00:15:19.800 --> 00:15:22.380 align:middle line:84%
And if we just
operate from there,

00:15:22.380 --> 00:15:24.890 align:middle line:84%
but we actually
allow the emotions,

00:15:24.890 --> 00:15:27.830 align:middle line:84%
we allow the energy that needs
to come up through the system

00:15:27.830 --> 00:15:30.110 align:middle line:84%
to be our teacher,
to be our guide,

00:15:30.110 --> 00:15:31.760 align:middle line:84%
then we can move
through these things.

00:15:31.760 --> 00:15:32.720 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: To help
resolve and heal.

00:15:32.720 --> 00:15:33.410 align:middle line:90%
>> BARSOTTI: Exactly.

00:15:33.410 --> 00:15:34.784 align:middle line:84%
But a lot of people
push it down,

00:15:34.784 --> 00:15:37.680 align:middle line:84%
like I can't feel that, I can't
deal with that, it's too much.

00:15:37.680 --> 00:15:38.480 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Right.

00:15:38.480 --> 00:15:39.980 align:middle line:84%
And the fact of the
matter is, there

00:15:39.980 --> 00:15:43.220 align:middle line:84%
is a grace in coming
in without memory,

00:15:43.220 --> 00:15:45.890 align:middle line:84%
without conscious memory of
the past, for the most part.

00:15:45.890 --> 00:15:46.010 align:middle line:90%
>> BARSOTTI: Yes.

00:15:46.010 --> 00:15:48.343 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: We might see a
little flicker here and there,

00:15:48.343 --> 00:15:52.030 align:middle line:84%
but by and large, what good
could that possibly do a person

00:15:52.030 --> 00:15:55.900 align:middle line:84%
who has come to
experience a thing or two?

00:15:55.900 --> 00:15:58.610 align:middle line:84%
To have all that in front
of them, and everything

00:15:58.610 --> 00:16:02.910 align:middle line:84%
they've ever been implicated
in, or desired, or whatnot.

00:16:02.910 --> 00:16:05.210 align:middle line:84%
So there is a grace into
this lack of memory.

00:16:05.210 --> 00:16:07.952 align:middle line:84%
Because a lot of people
complain about it and say,

00:16:07.952 --> 00:16:10.160 align:middle line:84%
I just don't understand why
I can't remember my past.

00:16:10.160 --> 00:16:11.868 align:middle line:84%
Well, maybe it's not
in our best interest

00:16:11.868 --> 00:16:15.107 align:middle line:84%
to remember too much at
one given time, right?

00:16:15.107 --> 00:16:15.940 align:middle line:90%
>> BARSOTTI: Agreed.

00:16:15.940 --> 00:16:16.740 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Yeah.

00:16:16.740 --> 00:16:18.647 align:middle line:84%
And so for you,
the dark side, you

00:16:18.647 --> 00:16:20.480 align:middle line:84%
were just seeing the
shadow or the emotions.

00:16:20.480 --> 00:16:24.200 align:middle line:90%


00:16:24.200 --> 00:16:25.730 align:middle line:84%
That's part of your
process, is you

00:16:25.730 --> 00:16:30.140 align:middle line:84%
do need to look at and start
exploring into the more

00:16:30.140 --> 00:16:31.540 align:middle line:90%
challenging part of ourselves.

00:16:31.540 --> 00:16:32.540 align:middle line:90%
>> BARSOTTI: Absolutely.

00:16:32.540 --> 00:16:33.875 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: So let's
talk about that.

00:16:33.875 --> 00:16:36.050 align:middle line:84%
>> BARSOTTI: So I have a
very strong belief that,

00:16:36.050 --> 00:16:40.220 align:middle line:84%
when we know our shadow,
we get closer to a source.

00:16:40.220 --> 00:16:42.860 align:middle line:84%
Because this really is a
journey to know thyself.

00:16:42.860 --> 00:16:46.160 align:middle line:84%
And as we get closer to
understanding our shadow,

00:16:46.160 --> 00:16:48.890 align:middle line:84%
and not be afraid
of our shadow, is

00:16:48.890 --> 00:16:52.510 align:middle line:84%
to have that opportunity
for the knowledge

00:16:52.510 --> 00:16:57.205 align:middle line:84%
for the transcendence, and
to gather the little bread

00:16:57.205 --> 00:16:58.940 align:middle line:90%
crumbs that are on our path.

00:16:58.940 --> 00:17:01.310 align:middle line:84%
And sometimes they're
in our shadow elements.

00:17:01.310 --> 00:17:05.990 align:middle line:84%
And so if we can
experience fully our shadow

00:17:05.990 --> 00:17:09.260 align:middle line:84%
and welcome it, not
be terrified of it,

00:17:09.260 --> 00:17:11.119 align:middle line:90%
then we grow through that.

00:17:11.119 --> 00:17:13.770 align:middle line:84%
And it also does a
couple of other things.

00:17:13.770 --> 00:17:16.700 align:middle line:84%
When we have the experience of
our shadow, it helps us to ask,

00:17:16.700 --> 00:17:18.200 align:middle line:84%
and when we ask,
we're creating more

00:17:18.200 --> 00:17:20.210 align:middle line:84%
of our vertical
relationship, and not

00:17:20.210 --> 00:17:23.450 align:middle line:84%
being in the horizontal plane,
which is where so much fear is.

00:17:23.450 --> 00:17:26.390 align:middle line:84%
So if we nurture
that vertical even

00:17:26.390 --> 00:17:28.490 align:middle line:84%
as we are addressing
the shadow, it's

00:17:28.490 --> 00:17:30.411 align:middle line:90%
just to say thank you anyway.

00:17:30.411 --> 00:17:32.410 align:middle line:84%
You don't even know why
you're saying thank you,

00:17:32.410 --> 00:17:34.220 align:middle line:84%
but to operate from
a place of gratitude

00:17:34.220 --> 00:17:37.190 align:middle line:84%
immediately starts
to transcend that.

00:17:37.190 --> 00:17:40.740 align:middle line:84%
So the shadow work is
so vitally important.

00:17:40.740 --> 00:17:41.540 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Right.

00:17:41.540 --> 00:17:44.120 align:middle line:84%
>> BARSOTTI: And I'd just like
to encourage everybody to have

00:17:44.120 --> 00:17:45.660 align:middle line:90%
the willingness to go there.

00:17:45.660 --> 00:17:47.330 align:middle line:90%
I know it can be scary.

00:17:47.330 --> 00:17:49.940 align:middle line:90%
I know that that's real.

00:17:49.940 --> 00:17:52.590 align:middle line:84%
However, once you get
there, you realize

00:17:52.590 --> 00:17:56.150 align:middle line:84%
there's no prickliness to
the ugly green monster.

00:17:56.150 --> 00:17:59.130 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: Usually it's
just a sad and neglected,

00:17:59.130 --> 00:18:02.300 align:middle line:84%
disempowered part that is
struggling to be addressed

00:18:02.300 --> 00:18:04.220 align:middle line:84%
on some level, or
to be acknowledged.

00:18:04.220 --> 00:18:05.510 align:middle line:90%
>> BARSOTTI: Exactly.

00:18:05.510 --> 00:18:07.550 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: OK, so that goes to
Carolyn Myss's work a little

00:18:07.550 --> 00:18:07.730 align:middle line:90%
bit.

00:18:07.730 --> 00:18:08.000 align:middle line:90%
>> BARSOTTI: Yes.

00:18:08.000 --> 00:18:08.690 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: OK.

00:18:08.690 --> 00:18:10.220 align:middle line:10%
Because you did
study hers, as well.

00:18:10.220 --> 00:18:12.170 align:middle line:10%
And this whole
notion-- and this has

00:18:12.170 --> 00:18:14.480 align:middle line:10%
to do with the shadow to
large degree, the four

00:18:14.480 --> 00:18:15.590 align:middle line:10%
basic archetypes, right?

00:18:15.590 --> 00:18:16.390 align:middle line:90%
>> BARSOTTI: Yes.

00:18:16.390 --> 00:18:18.810 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: The saboteur, the
prostitute, the inner child,

00:18:18.810 --> 00:18:19.610 align:middle line:90%
and the victim.

00:18:19.610 --> 00:18:22.130 align:middle line:84%
And these are shadowy
forces within us.

00:18:22.130 --> 00:18:23.810 align:middle line:84%
Let's talk about
these archetypes.

00:18:23.810 --> 00:18:25.700 align:middle line:84%
>> BARSOTTI: Yeah,
both shadow and light.

00:18:25.700 --> 00:18:26.799 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: And light, yes.

00:18:26.799 --> 00:18:28.340 align:middle line:84%
>> BARSOTTI: So I
really appreciate--

00:18:28.340 --> 00:18:31.400 align:middle line:84%
I had the good fortune
of studying with her

00:18:31.400 --> 00:18:35.090 align:middle line:84%
for an extended period
of time, over five years,

00:18:35.090 --> 00:18:39.800 align:middle line:84%
and there was a lot put in
towards these shadow-- sorry,

00:18:39.800 --> 00:18:41.490 align:middle line:90%
these archetypes of survival.

00:18:41.490 --> 00:18:42.290 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Yeah.

00:18:42.290 --> 00:18:46.190 align:middle line:10%
>> BARSOTTI: And so if we
understand that the saboteur is

00:18:46.190 --> 00:18:49.740 align:middle line:10%
really there to be our
teacher, one of the things that

00:18:49.740 --> 00:18:52.580 align:middle line:10%
I'm really propagating and
wanting to go forward with is

00:18:52.580 --> 00:18:55.730 align:middle line:10%
that, how do we move from
the archetypes of survival

00:18:55.730 --> 00:18:57.320 align:middle line:10%
to the archetypes of grace?

00:18:57.320 --> 00:18:59.420 align:middle line:84%
But we have to
know these aspects.

00:18:59.420 --> 00:19:01.790 align:middle line:90%
So that the victim is--

00:19:01.790 --> 00:19:05.630 align:middle line:84%
let's say that we have
a voice that constantly

00:19:05.630 --> 00:19:08.180 align:middle line:84%
sort of victimizing ourselves,
or victimizing and poking

00:19:08.180 --> 00:19:11.030 align:middle line:90%
other people.

00:19:11.030 --> 00:19:13.550 align:middle line:84%
If we look at our motivation
as to why we're doing that,

00:19:13.550 --> 00:19:15.740 align:middle line:84%
both to ourselves
and to others, that

00:19:15.740 --> 00:19:17.540 align:middle line:84%
helps us turn on
our accessibility

00:19:17.540 --> 00:19:18.980 align:middle line:90%
of making a new choice.

00:19:18.980 --> 00:19:20.600 align:middle line:84%
But if we're constantly
operating out

00:19:20.600 --> 00:19:23.700 align:middle line:84%
of that same pattern, now
we're on the drama triangle.

00:19:23.700 --> 00:19:25.730 align:middle line:84%
Now we're chasing
ourselves all over,

00:19:25.730 --> 00:19:27.440 align:middle line:84%
from victim,
rescuer, persecutor,

00:19:27.440 --> 00:19:30.840 align:middle line:84%
and back and forth, which is
a horrible, seductive loop

00:19:30.840 --> 00:19:32.360 align:middle line:90%
that we have to get off of.

00:19:32.360 --> 00:19:35.580 align:middle line:84%
And then the sabotage is
like the sabotaging thoughts,

00:19:35.580 --> 00:19:39.010 align:middle line:84%
the victimizing is what we
do to act on those thoughts,

00:19:39.010 --> 00:19:40.810 align:middle line:84%
and then the prostitute
is how we give away

00:19:40.810 --> 00:19:43.590 align:middle line:84%
our power, and then
the inner child--

00:19:43.590 --> 00:19:46.750 align:middle line:84%
inner child is just so
blessed and beautiful,

00:19:46.750 --> 00:19:50.620 align:middle line:84%
and to nurture it, but not
to be running our life out

00:19:50.620 --> 00:19:51.820 align:middle line:90%
of the inner child.

00:19:51.820 --> 00:19:53.890 align:middle line:90%
But our inner child can--

00:19:53.890 --> 00:19:55.879 align:middle line:90%
the curiosity, the playfulness.

00:19:55.879 --> 00:19:58.420 align:middle line:84%
Wouldn't that be fun to bring
that into absolutely everything

00:19:58.420 --> 00:19:59.620 align:middle line:90%
that we do as an adult?

00:19:59.620 --> 00:20:01.540 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Yes, absolutely.

00:20:01.540 --> 00:20:03.250 align:middle line:84%
If you don't mind,
in a couple of cases

00:20:03.250 --> 00:20:06.249 align:middle line:84%
where you've worked with
people, specifically

00:20:06.249 --> 00:20:08.290 align:middle line:84%
where you've worked with
one of these archetypes,

00:20:08.290 --> 00:20:11.050 align:middle line:84%
like the victim,
for example, tell us

00:20:11.050 --> 00:20:15.860 align:middle line:84%
about what you perceived
as their transformation

00:20:15.860 --> 00:20:17.510 align:middle line:84%
through that
particular archetype.

00:20:17.510 --> 00:20:19.980 align:middle line:84%
Because this really moves
us toward the story of race

00:20:19.980 --> 00:20:20.780 align:middle line:90%
anyway.

00:20:20.780 --> 00:20:22.190 align:middle line:90%
>> BARSOTTI: Totally.

00:20:22.190 --> 00:20:24.770 align:middle line:84%
Recently I started working in
a recovery center, which has

00:20:24.770 --> 00:20:27.050 align:middle line:90%
been an interesting challenge.

00:20:27.050 --> 00:20:30.830 align:middle line:84%
And really realizing how
much this trauma triangle

00:20:30.830 --> 00:20:33.800 align:middle line:90%
plays into the everyday life.

00:20:33.800 --> 00:20:37.550 align:middle line:84%
So what I notice is that, when
somebody is operating a victim,

00:20:37.550 --> 00:20:40.610 align:middle line:84%
they're doing the rescuer-victim
thing back and forth,

00:20:40.610 --> 00:20:43.110 align:middle line:84%
and it's like they keep
each other in a job.

00:20:43.110 --> 00:20:44.972 align:middle line:90%
So what I notice--

00:20:44.972 --> 00:20:47.180 align:middle line:84%
the first story that comes
to mind as you ask me this

00:20:47.180 --> 00:20:49.460 align:middle line:84%
is that recently,
just the other day,

00:20:49.460 --> 00:20:52.120 align:middle line:84%
I was working in the recovery
center and this woman,

00:20:52.120 --> 00:20:55.880 align:middle line:84%
I brought up to her about not
just the victim conversation,

00:20:55.880 --> 00:20:56.990 align:middle line:90%
but about--

00:20:56.990 --> 00:20:59.810 align:middle line:84%
she was saying, I really
thought how good of a person

00:20:59.810 --> 00:21:03.200 align:middle line:84%
I was, because I was always
taking care of everybody else's

00:21:03.200 --> 00:21:04.430 align:middle line:90%
needs, and all of that.

00:21:04.430 --> 00:21:06.316 align:middle line:84%
And I was like,
that's manipulation.

00:21:06.316 --> 00:21:07.940 align:middle line:84%
You're manipulating
people to like you.

00:21:07.940 --> 00:21:09.236 align:middle line:90%
She's like, you're right.

00:21:09.236 --> 00:21:10.610 align:middle line:84%
I just want
everybody to like me.

00:21:10.610 --> 00:21:12.752 align:middle line:84%
And I'm, like, a
really good person.

00:21:12.752 --> 00:21:14.210 align:middle line:84%
This is the
realization she got to.

00:21:14.210 --> 00:21:16.160 align:middle line:90%
I was like, uh-uh.

00:21:16.160 --> 00:21:18.590 align:middle line:90%
Stop it.

00:21:18.590 --> 00:21:20.130 align:middle line:90%
That's the vampire archetype.

00:21:20.130 --> 00:21:20.930 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Right.

00:21:20.930 --> 00:21:23.330 align:middle line:84%
>> BARSOTTI: That you actually
need to be in your own light,

00:21:23.330 --> 00:21:24.050 align:middle line:90%
not trying--

00:21:24.050 --> 00:21:26.360 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: You want everybody
to like you, to feed you.

00:21:26.360 --> 00:21:27.290 align:middle line:90%
>> BARSOTTI: Yes, exactly.

00:21:27.290 --> 00:21:28.280 align:middle line:90%
It's the feeding thing.

00:21:28.280 --> 00:21:28.640 align:middle line:90%
Right?

00:21:28.640 --> 00:21:30.681 align:middle line:84%
It's like, I need your
light in order to survive.

00:21:30.681 --> 00:21:32.720 align:middle line:90%
No, get your own light.

00:21:32.720 --> 00:21:33.740 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Right.

00:21:33.740 --> 00:21:35.540 align:middle line:84%
>> BARSOTTI: Stay
in your own light.

00:21:35.540 --> 00:21:38.750 align:middle line:84%
And so that was, like,
this major turning moment

00:21:38.750 --> 00:21:39.957 align:middle line:90%
where she was like--

00:21:39.957 --> 00:21:41.790 align:middle line:84%
and she has been in
recovery multiple times.

00:21:41.790 --> 00:21:45.184 align:middle line:84%
She's like, nobody has ever
said that I was a manipulation.

00:21:45.184 --> 00:21:47.100 align:middle line:84%
That was all a manipulation,
what I was doing.

00:21:47.100 --> 00:21:49.472 align:middle line:84%
And I was like, putting
it on the table right now.

00:21:49.472 --> 00:21:50.930 align:middle line:84%
That's exactly what
you were doing.

00:21:50.930 --> 00:21:54.040 align:middle line:84%
So what new choice
would you make?

00:21:54.040 --> 00:21:56.415 align:middle line:84%
And she really wasn't ready
to give an answer right then.

00:21:56.415 --> 00:21:58.331 align:middle line:84%
She was like, I really
have to think about it,

00:21:58.331 --> 00:22:00.005 align:middle line:84%
because this is
years of behavior.

00:22:00.005 --> 00:22:01.630 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: Well, an
addictive behavior.

00:22:01.630 --> 00:22:05.120 align:middle line:84%
Like you say, it's kind of a
seductive cycle that we get on.

00:22:05.120 --> 00:22:07.397 align:middle line:84%
There are a lot
of dense emotions,

00:22:07.397 --> 00:22:09.730 align:middle line:84%
and you're getting your charge,
even if it's negatively,

00:22:09.730 --> 00:22:11.031 align:middle line:90%
out of those dense emotions.

00:22:11.031 --> 00:22:12.030 align:middle line:90%
>> BARSOTTI: Absolutely.

00:22:12.030 --> 00:22:14.170 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: And I'm sure-- we've
all had these kind of self-talk

00:22:14.170 --> 00:22:16.770 align:middle line:84%
loops where we go back and forth
between one thing or another.

00:22:16.770 --> 00:22:17.080 align:middle line:90%
>> BARSOTTI: Yes.

00:22:17.080 --> 00:22:17.880 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Right?

00:22:17.880 --> 00:22:20.620 align:middle line:84%
OK, so let's talk about maybe
an example with the rescuer.

00:22:20.620 --> 00:22:21.430 align:middle line:90%
>> BARSOTTI: Yeah.

00:22:21.430 --> 00:22:26.170 align:middle line:84%
So the rescuer, this
is co-dependency.

00:22:26.170 --> 00:22:29.050 align:middle line:10%
And I really believe
that this is an abuse

00:22:29.050 --> 00:22:30.790 align:middle line:10%
of the divine feminine.

00:22:30.790 --> 00:22:34.930 align:middle line:84%
And if we can really understand
what codependency is--

00:22:34.930 --> 00:22:36.970 align:middle line:84%
and for the record,
let me just say,

00:22:36.970 --> 00:22:40.540 align:middle line:84%
it's putting everybody
else's needs before yours,

00:22:40.540 --> 00:22:43.060 align:middle line:84%
and making sure that everybody
else's needs are met,

00:22:43.060 --> 00:22:46.690 align:middle line:84%
and then you ultimately
are left empty.

00:22:46.690 --> 00:22:49.870 align:middle line:84%
I also see this energy a
lot around breast cancer,

00:22:49.870 --> 00:22:52.520 align:middle line:84%
when I'm working with
people with breast cancer.

00:22:52.520 --> 00:22:54.280 align:middle line:84%
I'm constantly looking
for these nuggets

00:22:54.280 --> 00:22:57.910 align:middle line:84%
of, where's the resentment
and grief, where's the guilt,

00:22:57.910 --> 00:23:01.330 align:middle line:84%
and where is this activity
of constant codependency?

00:23:01.330 --> 00:23:03.100 align:middle line:84%
Because we need to
train that out of it.

00:23:03.100 --> 00:23:04.472 align:middle line:90%
So that this rescuer--

00:23:04.472 --> 00:23:07.120 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: That would be more
under the prostitute archetype,

00:23:07.120 --> 00:23:09.402 align:middle line:84%
kind of giving in
power and energy away?

00:23:09.402 --> 00:23:10.360 align:middle line:90%
>> BARSOTTI: It can be.

00:23:10.360 --> 00:23:10.660 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: OK.

00:23:10.660 --> 00:23:11.470 align:middle line:90%
But go ahead, yeah.

00:23:11.470 --> 00:23:11.980 align:middle line:90%
>> BARSOTTI: It can be.

00:23:11.980 --> 00:23:14.290 align:middle line:84%
You can really get these all
of these that kind of link up.

00:23:14.290 --> 00:23:15.090 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: OK.

00:23:15.090 --> 00:23:21.040 align:middle line:10%
>> BARSOTTI: So the rescuer has
this habit of needing to feel

00:23:21.040 --> 00:23:25.970 align:middle line:10%
important and feel purposeful by
taking care of everybody else,

00:23:25.970 --> 00:23:27.940 align:middle line:10%
but then leaving
themselves empty.

00:23:27.940 --> 00:23:30.760 align:middle line:84%
That just isn't good
for us to do anymore,

00:23:30.760 --> 00:23:33.700 align:middle line:84%
and it makes the pendulum swing
too far in the other direction,

00:23:33.700 --> 00:23:35.260 align:middle line:90%
towards narcissism.

00:23:35.260 --> 00:23:38.120 align:middle line:84%
And the match made in
hell is the narcissist

00:23:38.120 --> 00:23:39.470 align:middle line:90%
and the codependent.

00:23:39.470 --> 00:23:40.270 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Right.

00:23:40.270 --> 00:23:43.206 align:middle line:84%
And there's a lot of that,
because they need each other.

00:23:43.206 --> 00:23:44.080 align:middle line:90%
>> BARSOTTI: They do.

00:23:44.080 --> 00:23:45.640 align:middle line:84%
But that's what
keeps them in a job.

00:23:45.640 --> 00:23:47.140 align:middle line:84%
And if we could
just recognize that,

00:23:47.140 --> 00:23:50.830 align:middle line:84%
if we could take care of our own
needs and stop feeling the need

00:23:50.830 --> 00:23:55.780 align:middle line:84%
that you need to be filled
up by somebody else's, then

00:23:55.780 --> 00:23:56.782 align:middle line:90%
you can shift that.

00:23:56.782 --> 00:23:58.240 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: And
isn't it true, also,

00:23:58.240 --> 00:24:00.730 align:middle line:84%
that some people that do this,
that are constantly giving

00:24:00.730 --> 00:24:02.860 align:middle line:84%
their energy away, is
simply because of a lack

00:24:02.860 --> 00:24:03.660 align:middle line:90%
of self-worth?

00:24:03.660 --> 00:24:05.368 align:middle line:84%
Thinking, if I don't
do that, they're not

00:24:05.368 --> 00:24:06.840 align:middle line:90%
going to like me, or whatnot?

00:24:06.840 --> 00:24:08.170 align:middle line:90%
There's that part of it, too.

00:24:08.170 --> 00:24:08.970 align:middle line:90%
>> BARSOTTI: Yes.

00:24:08.970 --> 00:24:11.290 align:middle line:84%
And that is where it
ties into the prostitute.

00:24:11.290 --> 00:24:12.090 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Right.

00:24:12.090 --> 00:24:14.920 align:middle line:84%
>> BARSOTTI: Because
I see that this--

00:24:14.920 --> 00:24:16.690 align:middle line:84%
I call these archetypes
of survival kind

00:24:16.690 --> 00:24:18.580 align:middle line:84%
of like the inner
critic committee.

00:24:18.580 --> 00:24:21.970 align:middle line:84%
They got all their information
from our upbringing,

00:24:21.970 --> 00:24:25.180 align:middle line:84%
and school, society,
parental, grandparents,

00:24:25.180 --> 00:24:27.670 align:middle line:84%
whatever the situation was
that we were raised in,

00:24:27.670 --> 00:24:29.720 align:middle line:84%
a lot of that
information is there.

00:24:29.720 --> 00:24:34.780 align:middle line:84%
So this prostitute is looking
for its sense of belonging,

00:24:34.780 --> 00:24:39.160 align:middle line:84%
really, where do I fit
in, but it's also the need

00:24:39.160 --> 00:24:41.590 align:middle line:90%
to step into authenticity.

00:24:41.590 --> 00:24:44.680 align:middle line:84%
And that's where it
becomes more empowered.

00:24:44.680 --> 00:24:45.730 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Right.

00:24:45.730 --> 00:24:47.260 align:middle line:90%
What about the saboteur?

00:24:47.260 --> 00:24:50.350 align:middle line:84%
>> BARSOTTI: The saboteur,
it can become the discerner

00:24:50.350 --> 00:24:54.130 align:middle line:84%
of truth, as it
can transcend that,

00:24:54.130 --> 00:24:56.119 align:middle line:84%
I don't need to
sabotage anymore.

00:24:56.119 --> 00:24:58.660 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: Any cases that come
up that really exemplify that?

00:24:58.660 --> 00:24:58.960 align:middle line:90%
>> BARSOTTI: Yeah.

00:24:58.960 --> 00:25:01.390 align:middle line:84%
Let me say this is a really
important thing, too.

00:25:01.390 --> 00:25:02.890 align:middle line:84%
What I notice with
this inner critic

00:25:02.890 --> 00:25:05.030 align:middle line:84%
committee, or the
archetypes of survival,

00:25:05.030 --> 00:25:07.330 align:middle line:84%
they have two main
fear points, which

00:25:07.330 --> 00:25:09.020 align:middle line:90%
are unworthy and unlovable.

00:25:09.020 --> 00:25:09.820 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Yeah.

00:25:09.820 --> 00:25:11.410 align:middle line:84%
>> BARSOTTI: I'm not
enough, unworthy,

00:25:11.410 --> 00:25:13.270 align:middle line:84%
kind of all the same
thing, and unlovable.

00:25:13.270 --> 00:25:16.300 align:middle line:84%
Those are the core wounds that
pretty much all of humanity

00:25:16.300 --> 00:25:17.270 align:middle line:90%
are healing.

00:25:17.270 --> 00:25:18.070 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Right.

00:25:18.070 --> 00:25:20.230 align:middle line:84%
>> BARSOTTI: So the saboteur
is where, let's say,

00:25:20.230 --> 00:25:21.510 align:middle line:90%
weight issues.

00:25:21.510 --> 00:25:25.600 align:middle line:84%
Oftentimes we will have,
oh, I shouldn't eat that,

00:25:25.600 --> 00:25:26.730 align:middle line:90%
or I shouldn't do that.

00:25:26.730 --> 00:25:30.790 align:middle line:90%
And the voice is the saboteur.

00:25:30.790 --> 00:25:32.980 align:middle line:84%
This is how I've
teased this apart.

00:25:32.980 --> 00:25:39.490 align:middle line:84%
This is not Caroline Myss's
work, this is my estimation,

00:25:39.490 --> 00:25:40.760 align:middle line:90%
and what I've seen.

00:25:40.760 --> 00:25:44.690 align:middle line:84%
The saboteur is the one that has
the voice of, oh, oh my god, I

00:25:44.690 --> 00:25:48.070 align:middle line:84%
want to eat that whole
pie, or whatever it is.

00:25:48.070 --> 00:25:51.040 align:middle line:84%
The victim part, the
victimizer part of us,

00:25:51.040 --> 00:25:54.130 align:middle line:84%
will actually do it, will
actually take the action.

00:25:54.130 --> 00:25:59.720 align:middle line:84%
So the saboteur has the tendency
now, with awareness, to say,

00:25:59.720 --> 00:26:01.120 align:middle line:90%
OK, what's the truth here?

00:26:01.120 --> 00:26:02.710 align:middle line:90%
Do I need that whole pie?

00:26:02.710 --> 00:26:05.200 align:middle line:90%
What do I actually really need?

00:26:05.200 --> 00:26:08.707 align:middle line:84%
If I ask myself that, it's
not the pie that I need,

00:26:08.707 --> 00:26:10.540 align:middle line:84%
I actually need some
other kind of soothing.

00:26:10.540 --> 00:26:11.530 align:middle line:90%
I need something else.

00:26:11.530 --> 00:26:14.590 align:middle line:84%
What just happened that I
can work further upstream

00:26:14.590 --> 00:26:17.650 align:middle line:84%
and be able to discern
what my needs truly are?

00:26:17.650 --> 00:26:18.830 align:middle line:90%
Because it's not the pie.

00:26:18.830 --> 00:26:19.630 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Right.

00:26:19.630 --> 00:26:22.870 align:middle line:84%
But on the negatively
afflicted side of the saboteur,

00:26:22.870 --> 00:26:23.875 align:middle line:90%
would say what?

00:26:23.875 --> 00:26:25.000 align:middle line:90%
>> BARSOTTI: I'm eating it.

00:26:25.000 --> 00:26:26.770 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: I'm eating it.

00:26:26.770 --> 00:26:29.030 align:middle line:84%
>> BARSOTTI: I'm going
to fall into the habit,

00:26:29.030 --> 00:26:31.727 align:middle line:84%
I'm going to fall into the
addictive kind of tendencies.

00:26:31.727 --> 00:26:33.310 align:middle line:84%
I'm going to have
the drink, I'm going

00:26:33.310 --> 00:26:37.120 align:middle line:84%
to do the things that I know
already that that actually

00:26:37.120 --> 00:26:37.960 align:middle line:90%
take me under.

00:26:37.960 --> 00:26:40.150 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: But that is the very
place that has the potential

00:26:40.150 --> 00:26:41.590 align:middle line:90%
to rise above it, as you say.

00:26:41.590 --> 00:26:42.190 align:middle line:90%
>> BARSOTTI: Absolutely.

00:26:42.190 --> 00:26:42.990 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Yeah.

00:26:42.990 --> 00:26:44.335 align:middle line:90%
What about the inner child?

00:26:44.335 --> 00:26:47.350 align:middle line:84%
>> BARSOTTI: Oh,
the inner child.

00:26:47.350 --> 00:26:49.720 align:middle line:10%
You know, Louise Hay
just passed recently,

00:26:49.720 --> 00:26:53.050 align:middle line:10%
and she taught a lot
on the inner child.

00:26:53.050 --> 00:26:55.210 align:middle line:84%
And once again, as much
as I love her work,

00:26:55.210 --> 00:26:56.740 align:middle line:90%
it was very incomplete.

00:26:56.740 --> 00:27:01.510 align:middle line:84%
And I would say that my
inner child has taught me

00:27:01.510 --> 00:27:06.670 align:middle line:84%
a lot through the pathways
of traversing other people's

00:27:06.670 --> 00:27:07.780 align:middle line:90%
inner child.

00:27:07.780 --> 00:27:13.670 align:middle line:84%
And what I have found
is, with our inner child,

00:27:13.670 --> 00:27:15.290 align:middle line:90%
they can call the shots.

00:27:15.290 --> 00:27:16.830 align:middle line:90%
Like in relationships.

00:27:16.830 --> 00:27:17.630 align:middle line:90%
I just want a man.

00:27:17.630 --> 00:27:19.084 align:middle line:90%
I just need to feel important.

00:27:19.084 --> 00:27:21.500 align:middle line:84%
I just need to feel grounded,
because of the relationship.

00:27:21.500 --> 00:27:24.060 align:middle line:90%
Or I just need to have a mother.

00:27:24.060 --> 00:27:26.330 align:middle line:84%
I need to have somebody--
as we're grown.

00:27:26.330 --> 00:27:28.860 align:middle line:84%
This is our inner
child running the show.

00:27:28.860 --> 00:27:34.250 align:middle line:84%
So if we emancipate and
really see the inner child

00:27:34.250 --> 00:27:38.030 align:middle line:84%
as being an opportunity to
get into playfulness, to get

00:27:38.030 --> 00:27:40.880 align:middle line:84%
into a place of
curiosity, then it

00:27:40.880 --> 00:27:43.010 align:middle line:84%
doesn't need to feel like
it's running the show.

00:27:43.010 --> 00:27:44.840 align:middle line:90%
But there is a place for it.

00:27:44.840 --> 00:27:47.090 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: So all these
archetypes end up holding us

00:27:47.090 --> 00:27:50.860 align:middle line:84%
kind of hostage on
some level, right?

00:27:50.860 --> 00:27:52.610 align:middle line:84%
And you're trying--
what you're saying is,

00:27:52.610 --> 00:27:54.900 align:middle line:84%
we need to move away
from the common--

00:27:54.900 --> 00:27:57.360 align:middle line:84%
well, the way you
understand the word karma.

00:27:57.360 --> 00:27:59.480 align:middle line:84%
Everyone understands the
word karma differently,

00:27:59.480 --> 00:28:01.530 align:middle line:84%
so first explain what
you mean by karma.

00:28:01.530 --> 00:28:04.560 align:middle line:84%
Away from karma into this
flow of grace, right?

00:28:04.560 --> 00:28:05.360 align:middle line:90%
>> BARSOTTI: Yes.

00:28:05.360 --> 00:28:07.610 align:middle line:10%
So I'm really meaning
more of that kind

00:28:07.610 --> 00:28:10.690 align:middle line:10%
of the pedestrian version
of karma, because karma

00:28:10.690 --> 00:28:13.100 align:middle line:10%
is a whole deep subject
which we can spend

00:28:13.100 --> 00:28:18.290 align:middle line:10%
an entire hour talking about,
but karma in the realm of cause

00:28:18.290 --> 00:28:22.070 align:middle line:10%
and effect, but specifically
dealing with the fact

00:28:22.070 --> 00:28:26.300 align:middle line:10%
that what I see
over and over again

00:28:26.300 --> 00:28:28.610 align:middle line:10%
is the need to step
off the karmic wheel.

00:28:28.610 --> 00:28:32.750 align:middle line:84%
We see how cyclically, I'm
just doing what my parents did.

00:28:32.750 --> 00:28:37.320 align:middle line:84%
I'm just-- this learned
behavior is advanced forward,

00:28:37.320 --> 00:28:41.110 align:middle line:84%
and I'm just reenacting
my same childhood.

00:28:41.110 --> 00:28:42.590 align:middle line:10%
>> REGINA: Or deep past.

00:28:42.590 --> 00:28:43.710 align:middle line:90%
I've always done this.

00:28:43.710 --> 00:28:44.585 align:middle line:90%
>> BARSOTTI: Exactly.

00:28:44.585 --> 00:28:46.084 align:middle line:90%
Exactly And that's--

00:28:46.084 --> 00:28:47.000 align:middle line:90%
I've always done this.

00:28:47.000 --> 00:28:48.740 align:middle line:84%
It's like, well,
that that's supposed

00:28:48.740 --> 00:28:52.920 align:middle line:84%
to be an excuse of some type,
just because it's a habit?

00:28:52.920 --> 00:28:53.720 align:middle line:90%
No.

00:28:53.720 --> 00:28:56.000 align:middle line:84%
I believe we're meant
to be looking at this.

00:28:56.000 --> 00:28:59.060 align:middle line:84%
So that's in which way I'm
speaking about the karma is,

00:28:59.060 --> 00:29:00.920 align:middle line:84%
when we look at a
certain event, do you

00:29:00.920 --> 00:29:03.330 align:middle line:84%
want to reproduce
that in the same way?

00:29:03.330 --> 00:29:04.130 align:middle line:90%
You know, wars.

00:29:04.130 --> 00:29:08.624 align:middle line:84%
We've been in wars forever,
since the evolutionary--

00:29:08.624 --> 00:29:10.040 align:middle line:84%
well, I don't want
to say forever,

00:29:10.040 --> 00:29:13.680 align:middle line:84%
because I don't know that
it was always about war,

00:29:13.680 --> 00:29:17.660 align:middle line:84%
but Steiner said that the Earth
is where conscious awakening

00:29:17.660 --> 00:29:19.390 align:middle line:90%
happens, versus other planets.

00:29:19.390 --> 00:29:20.390 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Right, right.

00:29:20.390 --> 00:29:21.770 align:middle line:90%
Exactly.

00:29:21.770 --> 00:29:24.080 align:middle line:84%
Well, it is a place
of high contrast.

00:29:24.080 --> 00:29:25.580 align:middle line:90%
That's fair to say.

00:29:25.580 --> 00:29:29.430 align:middle line:84%
means high contrast means
the beauty of choice.

00:29:29.430 --> 00:29:30.230 align:middle line:90%
>> BARSOTTI: Yes.

00:29:30.230 --> 00:29:34.070 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: But again, now this
takes us to the next level.

00:29:34.070 --> 00:29:37.100 align:middle line:84%
When you're looking
at choice, it's

00:29:37.100 --> 00:29:39.500 align:middle line:84%
hard to make a
good choice if you

00:29:39.500 --> 00:29:42.110 align:middle line:84%
don't hear the whisper
of your own higher mind,

00:29:42.110 --> 00:29:43.615 align:middle line:90%
your own higher self, right?

00:29:43.615 --> 00:29:44.490 align:middle line:90%
>> BARSOTTI: So true.

00:29:44.490 --> 00:29:48.890 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: So how much of your
work is really centered around

00:29:48.890 --> 00:29:51.840 align:middle line:84%
a person being able to
connect with their own voice?

00:29:51.840 --> 00:29:53.390 align:middle line:90%
>> BARSOTTI: 100%.

00:29:53.390 --> 00:29:54.200 align:middle line:90%
300%.

00:29:54.200 --> 00:29:55.060 align:middle line:90%
Mind, body, spirit.

00:29:55.060 --> 00:29:59.720 align:middle line:84%
That is my-- if I
haven't helped a person

00:29:59.720 --> 00:30:04.340 align:middle line:84%
to hear their inner voice
in whatever way it comes,

00:30:04.340 --> 00:30:06.590 align:middle line:84%
whether it's just a
sensing and a knowing

00:30:06.590 --> 00:30:10.580 align:middle line:84%
or an actual
audible kind of cue,

00:30:10.580 --> 00:30:13.610 align:middle line:84%
or however it comes
in for a person,

00:30:13.610 --> 00:30:16.940 align:middle line:84%
then I haven't been
successful in my job.

00:30:16.940 --> 00:30:19.105 align:middle line:84%
And it's not 100% my
responsibility, either.

00:30:19.105 --> 00:30:21.230 align:middle line:84%
There are people that will
come and not actually do

00:30:21.230 --> 00:30:22.130 align:middle line:90%
the work, of course.

00:30:22.130 --> 00:30:22.930 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Right.

00:30:22.930 --> 00:30:27.680 align:middle line:84%
>> BARSOTTI: So I have
to know that piece.

00:30:27.680 --> 00:30:30.710 align:middle line:84%
But what I'm fully
looking for is, how can I

00:30:30.710 --> 00:30:34.610 align:middle line:84%
be of service to this person by
turning on their own intuition?

00:30:34.610 --> 00:30:36.890 align:middle line:84%
Because I want to
give the tools.

00:30:36.890 --> 00:30:39.720 align:middle line:84%
I don't want to have to
do one-on-work therapy--

00:30:39.720 --> 00:30:40.995 align:middle line:90%
one-on-one-- forever.

00:30:40.995 --> 00:30:42.620 align:middle line:84%
And I don't believe
that we're supposed

00:30:42.620 --> 00:30:44.990 align:middle line:84%
to be in therapy for the
rest of our lives, either.

00:30:44.990 --> 00:30:47.780 align:middle line:84%
So what is it that
we can help to turn

00:30:47.780 --> 00:30:49.520 align:middle line:90%
on people's inner voice?

00:30:49.520 --> 00:30:51.980 align:middle line:84%
And a lot of this is
subconscious selves.

00:30:51.980 --> 00:30:54.770 align:middle line:84%
And where I see a
huge interrupter

00:30:54.770 --> 00:30:57.965 align:middle line:84%
is sabotaging voice and
the mental judge self,

00:30:57.965 --> 00:30:59.465 align:middle line:84%
which we haven't
really gotten into.

00:30:59.465 --> 00:31:00.500 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: Let's
get into it now.

00:31:00.500 --> 00:31:01.300 align:middle line:90%
>> BARSOTTI: OK.

00:31:01.300 --> 00:31:03.950 align:middle line:84%
So in the system
that I like to teach,

00:31:03.950 --> 00:31:06.440 align:middle line:84%
which is called Personal
Self Integration,

00:31:06.440 --> 00:31:08.990 align:middle line:90%
is the seven selves.

00:31:08.990 --> 00:31:11.540 align:middle line:84%
So when I was
studying the Steiner

00:31:11.540 --> 00:31:16.067 align:middle line:84%
piece and the Egyptian pieces,
these other two additional

00:31:16.067 --> 00:31:18.650 align:middle line:84%
selves that I mentioned earlier,
about the nine eyes of light,

00:31:18.650 --> 00:31:21.080 align:middle line:84%
and then Steiner taught
that there were nine selves.

00:31:21.080 --> 00:31:23.810 align:middle line:84%
What I have found in
studying their teachings is

00:31:23.810 --> 00:31:27.500 align:middle line:84%
that those other two selves
are a little bit more--

00:31:27.500 --> 00:31:30.200 align:middle line:84%
they're there, but
they're more outside

00:31:30.200 --> 00:31:33.020 align:middle line:90%
of our sort of current system.

00:31:33.020 --> 00:31:35.680 align:middle line:84%
I found the seven a
nice model to work with.

00:31:35.680 --> 00:31:37.334 align:middle line:84%
It's not completely
overwhelming.

00:31:37.334 --> 00:31:38.750 align:middle line:84%
It's already
overwhelming to think

00:31:38.750 --> 00:31:40.530 align:middle line:84%
that you've got all
these voices going on,

00:31:40.530 --> 00:31:42.360 align:middle line:84%
and these internal
conversations.

00:31:42.360 --> 00:31:46.400 align:middle line:84%
But I worked with somebody who
had a multiple personality--

00:31:46.400 --> 00:31:48.080 align:middle line:90%
five that I counted--

00:31:48.080 --> 00:31:51.710 align:middle line:84%
who needed to be in a different
part in my office for every

00:31:51.710 --> 00:31:53.210 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: Part of
the conversation,

00:31:53.210 --> 00:31:53.540 align:middle line:90%
depending on who was there?

00:31:53.540 --> 00:31:55.123 align:middle line:84%
>> BARSOTTI: Part
of the conversation.

00:31:55.123 --> 00:31:58.130 align:middle line:84%
And one part was mute and
would only draw pictures,

00:31:58.130 --> 00:32:00.440 align:middle line:84%
and was fetal, and she
would only draw pictures

00:32:00.440 --> 00:32:02.310 align:middle line:90%
when she felt like doing it.

00:32:02.310 --> 00:32:05.060 align:middle line:84%
So I was scared to death
about, oh my god, I'm

00:32:05.060 --> 00:32:07.940 align:middle line:84%
going to introduce seven
more selves to her?

00:32:07.940 --> 00:32:10.360 align:middle line:84%
Not all at once, it
doesn't work like that.

00:32:10.360 --> 00:32:14.510 align:middle line:84%
But I invited to the table,
what if there was really

00:32:14.510 --> 00:32:17.840 align:middle line:84%
a place for each
of these selves?

00:32:17.840 --> 00:32:21.330 align:middle line:84%
And what ended up happening
was, an integration happened.

00:32:21.330 --> 00:32:24.717 align:middle line:84%
It didn't happen overnight,
but it felt welcome.

00:32:24.717 --> 00:32:27.050 align:middle line:84%
They didn't-- they were like,
I don't want to be drugged

00:32:27.050 --> 00:32:27.850 align:middle line:90%
anymore.

00:32:27.850 --> 00:32:29.880 align:middle line:84%
I don't want to be told
that I don't exist.

00:32:29.880 --> 00:32:31.500 align:middle line:90%
I do exist.

00:32:31.500 --> 00:32:34.910 align:middle line:84%
So what was blocking her--
she was highly intuitive.

00:32:34.910 --> 00:32:38.840 align:middle line:84%
But what was blocking her
was her mental judge self.

00:32:38.840 --> 00:32:42.290 align:middle line:84%
There was a fear,
because there's a core--

00:32:42.290 --> 00:32:48.430 align:middle line:84%
so humans have the core fear
of being unworthy and lovable.

00:32:48.430 --> 00:32:54.290 align:middle line:84%
The subconscious fears are
being enslaved or annihilated.

00:32:54.290 --> 00:32:57.230 align:middle line:84%
And so when we deal with these
deep-rooted subconscious,

00:32:57.230 --> 00:32:59.270 align:middle line:84%
unconscious pieces,
maybe there's

00:32:59.270 --> 00:33:01.240 align:middle line:84%
something, a belief in
the mental judge self

00:33:01.240 --> 00:33:05.720 align:middle line:84%
that's saying, oh no, the last
time we trusted the high self,

00:33:05.720 --> 00:33:08.360 align:middle line:84%
we ended up in as a
gladiator in the lion's den.

00:33:08.360 --> 00:33:10.970 align:middle line:90%


00:33:10.970 --> 00:33:13.810 align:middle line:84%
That was the extent
of our lives.

00:33:13.810 --> 00:33:15.670 align:middle line:84%
We're not going
to do that again.

00:33:15.670 --> 00:33:16.670 align:middle line:90%
So we have to cure that.

00:33:16.670 --> 00:33:17.918 align:middle line:90%
We have to help that.

00:33:17.918 --> 00:33:20.990 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: So how do you, then--

00:33:20.990 --> 00:33:23.690 align:middle line:84%
forget going into direct
communication for higher mind

00:33:23.690 --> 00:33:28.490 align:middle line:84%
just yet, because that's
a process for most people.

00:33:28.490 --> 00:33:31.520 align:middle line:84%
But where do you even start
listening is a good one.

00:33:31.520 --> 00:33:33.410 align:middle line:84%
And maybe that's a
good place to go.

00:33:33.410 --> 00:33:40.000 align:middle line:84%
Where do people first notice the
signaling from the higher self?

00:33:40.000 --> 00:33:44.420 align:middle line:84%
Is it often in the
body, or emotions, or?

00:33:44.420 --> 00:33:46.610 align:middle line:84%
Where do you find, with
most of your clients,

00:33:46.610 --> 00:33:50.030 align:middle line:84%
it landed to get their
attention enough to understand

00:33:50.030 --> 00:33:51.647 align:middle line:90%
they needed to engage?

00:33:51.647 --> 00:33:53.397 align:middle line:84%
>> BARSOTTI: Beautiful,
love the question.

00:33:53.397 --> 00:33:55.910 align:middle line:84%
What I find, and trying
to help people with,

00:33:55.910 --> 00:33:58.610 align:middle line:84%
is understanding that our
emotions are our guidance

00:33:58.610 --> 00:33:59.540 align:middle line:90%
system.

00:33:59.540 --> 00:34:03.230 align:middle line:84%
So many people are trying
to squash it, right?

00:34:03.230 --> 00:34:05.750 align:middle line:84%
And something I've been
teaching on recently,

00:34:05.750 --> 00:34:08.750 align:middle line:84%
in groups and in
private practice,

00:34:08.750 --> 00:34:11.570 align:middle line:90%
is, anxiety is not an emotion.

00:34:11.570 --> 00:34:14.480 align:middle line:84%
Anxiety is the evidence
that you've been walling off

00:34:14.480 --> 00:34:16.429 align:middle line:84%
the emotions, and
that we actually

00:34:16.429 --> 00:34:18.270 align:middle line:90%
need to let that stream move.

00:34:18.270 --> 00:34:19.070 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Right.

00:34:19.070 --> 00:34:19.870 align:middle line:90%
>> BARSOTTI: Right?

00:34:19.870 --> 00:34:23.510 align:middle line:84%
So if I can get people to
start getting comfortable

00:34:23.510 --> 00:34:26.360 align:middle line:84%
with their emotions,
their guidance system

00:34:26.360 --> 00:34:28.370 align:middle line:90%
is part and parcel to that.

00:34:28.370 --> 00:34:31.790 align:middle line:84%
So then their language,
however their high self,

00:34:31.790 --> 00:34:35.690 align:middle line:84%
besides literally taking them
on a guided imagery meditation

00:34:35.690 --> 00:34:37.550 align:middle line:90%
to meet their high self.

00:34:37.550 --> 00:34:39.110 align:middle line:90%
Sometimes when that happens--

00:34:39.110 --> 00:34:40.723 align:middle line:84%
it actually happens
quite a bit--

00:34:40.723 --> 00:34:42.139 align:middle line:84%
the mental judge
self, once again,

00:34:42.139 --> 00:34:44.969 align:middle line:84%
will intermit and
say, no, no, no,

00:34:44.969 --> 00:34:48.060 align:middle line:84%
or another self that has some
fear or trepidation about going

00:34:48.060 --> 00:34:48.860 align:middle line:90%
there.

00:34:48.860 --> 00:34:50.630 align:middle line:84%
And then we have
to overcome that.

00:34:50.630 --> 00:34:53.444 align:middle line:84%
So what I find is, is that
everybody's signal is a little

00:34:53.444 --> 00:34:54.860 align:middle line:84%
bit different, and
how we're going

00:34:54.860 --> 00:34:57.050 align:middle line:84%
to get there is
a unique process,

00:34:57.050 --> 00:35:01.430 align:middle line:84%
but usually we can land
on, well, what emotion?

00:35:01.430 --> 00:35:02.600 align:middle line:90%
What is the sensation?

00:35:02.600 --> 00:35:04.940 align:middle line:84%
Go to that gut
feeling, when you knew

00:35:04.940 --> 00:35:06.920 align:middle line:84%
you knew you knew
something, and it

00:35:06.920 --> 00:35:09.290 align:middle line:90%
was absolutely unquestionable.

00:35:09.290 --> 00:35:12.890 align:middle line:90%
And then we build on that.

00:35:12.890 --> 00:35:15.820 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: Build on
a success, already.

00:35:15.820 --> 00:35:18.260 align:middle line:84%
This is another
thing that comes up,

00:35:18.260 --> 00:35:22.760 align:middle line:84%
and that is the distinction
between feelings and emotions.

00:35:22.760 --> 00:35:27.350 align:middle line:84%
Because to me, there's
a big distinction.

00:35:27.350 --> 00:35:30.950 align:middle line:84%
And I might struggle
for words to define it,

00:35:30.950 --> 00:35:33.610 align:middle line:84%
but I know the difference
between the two

00:35:33.610 --> 00:35:35.470 align:middle line:90%
when I'm experiencing it.

00:35:35.470 --> 00:35:37.430 align:middle line:84%
Or that kind of, like
you said, that feeling,

00:35:37.430 --> 00:35:40.670 align:middle line:84%
like where a kind of
anxiety or something blows

00:35:40.670 --> 00:35:42.410 align:middle line:90%
through like a wind.

00:35:42.410 --> 00:35:46.250 align:middle line:84%
For an example, when something
like this, a sense of anxiety--

00:35:46.250 --> 00:35:48.280 align:middle line:84%
you're fine, you're
just doing your day--

00:35:48.280 --> 00:35:50.150 align:middle line:90%
and it blows through you.

00:35:50.150 --> 00:35:51.920 align:middle line:84%
It's like, what
just happened there?

00:35:51.920 --> 00:35:53.900 align:middle line:84%
I'm not thinking
an anxious thought,

00:35:53.900 --> 00:35:56.870 align:middle line:84%
I don't have any emotions
charged around it.

00:35:56.870 --> 00:36:00.710 align:middle line:84%
So let's talk about what
that subtle sense of feelings

00:36:00.710 --> 00:36:02.772 align:middle line:90%
is that blow through us.

00:36:02.772 --> 00:36:03.980 align:middle line:90%
>> BARSOTTI: I just love you.

00:36:03.980 --> 00:36:06.021 align:middle line:84%
Because we get to get into
all of this fun stuff.

00:36:06.021 --> 00:36:07.550 align:middle line:90%
So I actually teach as a tool--

00:36:07.550 --> 00:36:09.050 align:middle line:84%
I actually have a
handout on this--

00:36:09.050 --> 00:36:11.520 align:middle line:84%
is the emotional
discernment tool.

00:36:11.520 --> 00:36:13.400 align:middle line:90%
And one of the things that--

00:36:13.400 --> 00:36:15.920 align:middle line:84%
so often, many of
us are empaths.

00:36:15.920 --> 00:36:19.452 align:middle line:84%
We're feeling not just what
you and I are doing the dance

00:36:19.452 --> 00:36:20.660 align:middle line:90%
in a conversation right now--

00:36:20.660 --> 00:36:22.610 align:middle line:84%
I'm not feeling your
emotions, though.

00:36:22.610 --> 00:36:24.839 align:middle line:84%
You've got your
boundaries, I have mine.

00:36:24.839 --> 00:36:27.380 align:middle line:84%
By the way, that's another piece
of the prostitute archetype,

00:36:27.380 --> 00:36:29.030 align:middle line:90%
is to have boundaries.

00:36:29.030 --> 00:36:34.140 align:middle line:84%
So when a person is feeling
a sense of emotional--

00:36:34.140 --> 00:36:34.940 align:middle line:90%
overwhelmed.

00:36:34.940 --> 00:36:36.980 align:middle line:84%
Whatever, if it's
anxiety, if all

00:36:36.980 --> 00:36:39.560 align:middle line:84%
of a sudden it's overwhelming
sadness and grief,

00:36:39.560 --> 00:36:43.640 align:middle line:84%
like they just walked into
this plasma bubble of stuff.

00:36:43.640 --> 00:36:46.910 align:middle line:84%
What I teach them is
to ask, is this mine?

00:36:46.910 --> 00:36:48.180 align:middle line:90%
So ask-- first question--

00:36:48.180 --> 00:36:48.430 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: Number
one, is this mine?

00:36:48.430 --> 00:36:50.317 align:middle line:84%
>> BARSOTTI: Number
one, is this mine?

00:36:50.317 --> 00:36:52.400 align:middle line:84%
And start to listen to
that intuitive voice, which

00:36:52.400 --> 00:36:55.670 align:middle line:84%
is another way of starting to
increase that dialogue that

00:36:55.670 --> 00:36:58.610 align:middle line:84%
goes back and forth
for high self.

00:36:58.610 --> 00:37:00.230 align:middle line:90%
Is this mine, yes or no.

00:37:00.230 --> 00:37:02.120 align:middle line:90%
Listen for the first answer.

00:37:02.120 --> 00:37:03.514 align:middle line:90%
If it's yes, OK.

00:37:03.514 --> 00:37:05.180 align:middle line:84%
Look at where it
showed up in your body.

00:37:05.180 --> 00:37:07.160 align:middle line:84%
Look and see if there was a
memory that got triggered.

00:37:07.160 --> 00:37:08.810 align:middle line:84%
Look and see what
the situation was.

00:37:08.810 --> 00:37:11.810 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: Did a smell or a
word or a sound trigger it?

00:37:11.810 --> 00:37:12.775 align:middle line:90%
>> BARSOTTI: Exactly.

00:37:12.775 --> 00:37:16.560 align:middle line:84%
And if it's not yours,
then the next question

00:37:16.560 --> 00:37:18.180 align:middle line:90%
is, male or female?

00:37:18.180 --> 00:37:21.600 align:middle line:84%
Friend, family, colleague,
situation, environment,

00:37:21.600 --> 00:37:22.980 align:middle line:90%
what was it?

00:37:22.980 --> 00:37:25.050 align:middle line:84%
Usually by the time
you ask that question

00:37:25.050 --> 00:37:27.870 align:middle line:84%
the situation or person
has popped into your mind

00:37:27.870 --> 00:37:31.230 align:middle line:84%
and you go, oh, actually--
and in fact, every time

00:37:31.230 --> 00:37:33.780 align:middle line:84%
I'm with that person, or
every time I'm in that space,

00:37:33.780 --> 00:37:35.170 align:middle line:90%
this is what I feel.

00:37:35.170 --> 00:37:37.710 align:middle line:90%
OK, this is not mine.

00:37:37.710 --> 00:37:40.570 align:middle line:84%
I can't process somebody
else's emotions for them.

00:37:40.570 --> 00:37:41.370 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Right.

00:37:41.370 --> 00:37:43.080 align:middle line:84%
This is really
important because a lot

00:37:43.080 --> 00:37:44.850 align:middle line:84%
of people that are
watching this show

00:37:44.850 --> 00:37:48.060 align:middle line:84%
are very open, very empathic,
probably prostitutes

00:37:48.060 --> 00:37:49.440 align:middle line:90%
in the true sense of the word--

00:37:49.440 --> 00:37:50.490 align:middle line:90%
I'm one, too.

00:37:50.490 --> 00:37:52.560 align:middle line:84%
You know, where you
can't draw boundaries

00:37:52.560 --> 00:37:54.780 align:middle line:84%
and you're feeling
everybody else's stuff.

00:37:54.780 --> 00:37:56.640 align:middle line:90%
So that's very practical.

00:37:56.640 --> 00:37:59.610 align:middle line:84%
Now, when you're looking at
the means of discerning this,

00:37:59.610 --> 00:38:01.770 align:middle line:84%
you can just ask and say,
uh-huh, uh-uh, or you

00:38:01.770 --> 00:38:05.370 align:middle line:90%
can use divination, for example.

00:38:05.370 --> 00:38:07.890 align:middle line:84%
How does your work interface
with using divination

00:38:07.890 --> 00:38:09.250 align:middle line:90%
in this process of discernment?

00:38:09.250 --> 00:38:10.050 align:middle line:90%
>> BARSOTTI: Yeah.

00:38:10.050 --> 00:38:14.100 align:middle line:84%
So for me, I'm pretty
good about teasing out,

00:38:14.100 --> 00:38:17.880 align:middle line:84%
because I operate as an
empath for a long time.

00:38:17.880 --> 00:38:18.930 align:middle line:90%
There's a PS to this.

00:38:18.930 --> 00:38:21.630 align:middle line:84%
The reason that we
usually become empathic

00:38:21.630 --> 00:38:24.450 align:middle line:84%
is because we had to keep
ourselves safe in a situation

00:38:24.450 --> 00:38:25.860 align:middle line:90%
where we weren't safe.

00:38:25.860 --> 00:38:29.040 align:middle line:84%
So we get so good at
reading the landscape

00:38:29.040 --> 00:38:31.740 align:middle line:84%
that we forget that,
when we're adults,

00:38:31.740 --> 00:38:36.000 align:middle line:84%
that we don't need to be in
that coping realm anymore.

00:38:36.000 --> 00:38:39.870 align:middle line:84%
How we coped as kids saved
us, but if we cope that way

00:38:39.870 --> 00:38:42.510 align:middle line:90%
as an adult, it can kill us.

00:38:42.510 --> 00:38:47.510 align:middle line:84%
And so that's a discerning way
of looking at this, as well.

00:38:47.510 --> 00:38:48.310 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Yes.

00:38:48.310 --> 00:38:51.125 align:middle line:84%
And so now let's say we've
gotten the first bit,

00:38:51.125 --> 00:38:53.160 align:middle line:90%
that's not mine, but we can't--

00:38:53.160 --> 00:38:58.620 align:middle line:84%
we don't have the language for
it in terms of our connection

00:38:58.620 --> 00:39:00.510 align:middle line:84%
just yet-- the
direct connection.

00:39:00.510 --> 00:39:02.161 align:middle line:90%
Can you use divination devices?

00:39:02.161 --> 00:39:03.160 align:middle line:90%
>> BARSOTTI: Absolutely.

00:39:03.160 --> 00:39:06.305 align:middle line:84%
Pendulums, the personal
muscle testing,

00:39:06.305 --> 00:39:07.680 align:middle line:84%
if people aren't
necessarily good

00:39:07.680 --> 00:39:09.330 align:middle line:84%
with their fingers
or their hands,

00:39:09.330 --> 00:39:10.720 align:middle line:90%
they can just do a sway test.

00:39:10.720 --> 00:39:12.430 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: Right,
that one's a good one.

00:39:12.430 --> 00:39:14.861 align:middle line:84%
Just sway forward or
sway away, it's almost

00:39:14.861 --> 00:39:16.110 align:middle line:90%
like you're being pushed back.

00:39:16.110 --> 00:39:16.985 align:middle line:90%
>> BARSOTTI: Exactly.

00:39:16.985 --> 00:39:19.032 align:middle line:84%
That one seems to be
most obvious to people.

00:39:19.032 --> 00:39:20.990 align:middle line:84%
It's the one I like to
give as a tool because--

00:39:20.990 --> 00:39:22.365 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: Don't
wear high heels.

00:39:22.365 --> 00:39:26.990 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHTER]

00:39:26.990 --> 00:39:30.060 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: Yeah, so that's
good as a little tool,

00:39:30.060 --> 00:39:32.190 align:middle line:84%
because I think this
happens to people.

00:39:32.190 --> 00:39:34.020 align:middle line:84%
Because we are so
intertwined, our fields

00:39:34.020 --> 00:39:37.680 align:middle line:84%
are so open now, that
everything seems to come in

00:39:37.680 --> 00:39:40.720 align:middle line:84%
and we can't tell what's ours at
all anymore, in a lot of cases.

00:39:40.720 --> 00:39:41.520 align:middle line:90%
Right?

00:39:41.520 --> 00:39:42.478 align:middle line:90%
>> BARSOTTI: It's true.

00:39:42.478 --> 00:39:47.670 align:middle line:84%
This discernment, I would
say probably 90% of my week,

00:39:47.670 --> 00:39:49.260 align:middle line:90%
I hand out that tool.

00:39:49.260 --> 00:39:51.030 align:middle line:84%
If they don't already
know it, then we're

00:39:51.030 --> 00:39:53.970 align:middle line:84%
talking about their
exercising of it,

00:39:53.970 --> 00:39:56.310 align:middle line:84%
and making sure that they
actually get this as--

00:39:56.310 --> 00:39:57.990 align:middle line:84%
you know, it's like
exercising a muscle.

00:39:57.990 --> 00:40:00.270 align:middle line:90%
You do need to learn it.

00:40:00.270 --> 00:40:03.150 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: Is it your feeling
that in the case of literal

00:40:03.150 --> 00:40:05.590 align:middle line:84%
multiple personalities,
for example,

00:40:05.590 --> 00:40:08.100 align:middle line:84%
that you can have someone
who's literally just taking

00:40:08.100 --> 00:40:11.650 align:middle line:84%
on another entity full on,
and that's what's going on.

00:40:11.650 --> 00:40:13.350 align:middle line:84%
You're not talking
to one person,

00:40:13.350 --> 00:40:17.880 align:middle line:84%
you're talking to literally
several different entities.

00:40:17.880 --> 00:40:20.760 align:middle line:84%
Because they're so permeable,
they have no boundaries at all,

00:40:20.760 --> 00:40:21.630 align:middle line:90%
right?

00:40:21.630 --> 00:40:23.170 align:middle line:90%
>> BARSOTTI: Exactly.

00:40:23.170 --> 00:40:25.230 align:middle line:84%
And I just wanted to
say something, also,

00:40:25.230 --> 00:40:27.180 align:middle line:84%
about the prostitute
archetype, because we all

00:40:27.180 --> 00:40:28.830 align:middle line:90%
have the prostitute archetype.

00:40:28.830 --> 00:40:32.280 align:middle line:84%
Those archetypes of survival
every single one of us has.

00:40:32.280 --> 00:40:36.450 align:middle line:84%
So this opportunity, when
we are connecting with--

00:40:36.450 --> 00:40:39.240 align:middle line:84%
it's like we get into an
argument with ourselves

00:40:39.240 --> 00:40:42.240 align:middle line:84%
and feel like nobody
wins, sometimes.

00:40:42.240 --> 00:40:43.440 align:middle line:90%
That's an opportunity.

00:40:43.440 --> 00:40:45.660 align:middle line:84%
That's an opportunity
for engagement.

00:40:45.660 --> 00:40:48.120 align:middle line:84%
Well, let's sit
down as though I'm

00:40:48.120 --> 00:40:51.300 align:middle line:84%
going to have time and
conversation with that part.

00:40:51.300 --> 00:40:54.450 align:middle line:84%
Well, what's your
feelings about this?

00:40:54.450 --> 00:40:56.970 align:middle line:84%
And this is so,
so, so important.

00:40:56.970 --> 00:40:59.610 align:middle line:84%
We, as our outer
self personality,

00:40:59.610 --> 00:41:02.010 align:middle line:90%
are calling the shots.

00:41:02.010 --> 00:41:05.760 align:middle line:84%
Our subconscious selves
are along for the ride.

00:41:05.760 --> 00:41:08.340 align:middle line:84%
If one of them or
more has a fear

00:41:08.340 --> 00:41:10.830 align:middle line:84%
about what it is that
we are putting ourselves

00:41:10.830 --> 00:41:14.250 align:middle line:84%
in the midst of, there
will be sabotage.

00:41:14.250 --> 00:41:15.090 align:middle line:90%
There will be some--

00:41:15.090 --> 00:41:17.340 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: The subconscious
doesn't allow itself to be

00:41:17.340 --> 00:41:17.790 align:middle line:90%
threatened.

00:41:17.790 --> 00:41:18.780 align:middle line:90%
>> BARSOTTI: Exactly.

00:41:18.780 --> 00:41:23.880 align:middle line:84%
So whether or not that
threat is sensical or not is

00:41:23.880 --> 00:41:26.850 align:middle line:84%
a whole other judgment call
that we then have to look at.

00:41:26.850 --> 00:41:31.650 align:middle line:84%
But if it is sensical, then that
is something, hey, back off.

00:41:31.650 --> 00:41:33.330 align:middle line:90%
Back off from the cliff.

00:41:33.330 --> 00:41:35.892 align:middle line:84%
You don't need to be always
so edgy in your life.

00:41:35.892 --> 00:41:37.350 align:middle line:84%
What's the reason
that you're going

00:41:37.350 --> 00:41:39.808 align:middle line:84%
to say that thing that triggers
the person just because you

00:41:39.808 --> 00:41:40.840 align:middle line:90%
can?

00:41:40.840 --> 00:41:42.900 align:middle line:84%
That's trying to look
for control and power

00:41:42.900 --> 00:41:45.570 align:middle line:84%
over another person, and
that's the misuse of power.

00:41:45.570 --> 00:41:46.410 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Right.

00:41:46.410 --> 00:41:49.020 align:middle line:84%
What about-- we're talking
about Haley Wilford,

00:41:49.020 --> 00:41:52.080 align:middle line:84%
the subconscious
will protect itself.

00:41:52.080 --> 00:41:55.380 align:middle line:84%
And it's there to, ultimately,
protect us and signal us

00:41:55.380 --> 00:41:59.220 align:middle line:84%
from past experience lodged
in the body and the emotions

00:41:59.220 --> 00:42:00.190 align:middle line:90%
and so forth.

00:42:00.190 --> 00:42:02.310 align:middle line:84%
So how do you then
reverse that and begin

00:42:02.310 --> 00:42:05.520 align:middle line:84%
working with transforming
those aspects?

00:42:05.520 --> 00:42:09.227 align:middle line:84%
Or do you ever transform
the subconscious?

00:42:09.227 --> 00:42:10.310 align:middle line:90%
>> BARSOTTI: I believe so.

00:42:10.310 --> 00:42:13.320 align:middle line:84%
I think it's a reflexive
system just in the same way

00:42:13.320 --> 00:42:14.930 align:middle line:90%
that our vagus nerve is.

00:42:14.930 --> 00:42:17.130 align:middle line:84%
You know, outward,
inward, inward, outward.

00:42:17.130 --> 00:42:18.660 align:middle line:90%
As above, so below.

00:42:18.660 --> 00:42:21.480 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: So if it can grow
to trust in something higher,

00:42:21.480 --> 00:42:25.170 align:middle line:84%
it can begin transforming all
of the pixels of experience

00:42:25.170 --> 00:42:27.450 align:middle line:84%
and fear and such that
it's holding onto?

00:42:27.450 --> 00:42:31.060 align:middle line:84%
>> BARSOTTI: That is our job
as the outer self personality.

00:42:31.060 --> 00:42:34.290 align:middle line:84%
In this conglomeration that we
are of our subconscious selves,

00:42:34.290 --> 00:42:36.130 align:middle line:90%
we're in it together.

00:42:36.130 --> 00:42:38.860 align:middle line:84%
We're in it together
as a human species,

00:42:38.860 --> 00:42:42.060 align:middle line:84%
but we're in it together in
our inner and outer selves.

00:42:42.060 --> 00:42:45.390 align:middle line:90%
And so it's all about the trust.

00:42:45.390 --> 00:42:48.160 align:middle line:84%
And when we really have
that internal trust of all

00:42:48.160 --> 00:42:51.390 align:middle line:84%
of these voices, these
subconscious selves,

00:42:51.390 --> 00:42:54.570 align:middle line:84%
then we can also have more
trust in our high self.

00:42:54.570 --> 00:42:56.280 align:middle line:84%
And that's really
the key, because we

00:42:56.280 --> 00:42:59.880 align:middle line:84%
need to be able to have those
kinds of internal conversations

00:42:59.880 --> 00:43:02.029 align:middle line:84%
that, once again, help
us know ourselves.

00:43:02.029 --> 00:43:04.320 align:middle line:84%
Understanding the shadow,
understanding the things that

00:43:04.320 --> 00:43:06.150 align:middle line:84%
may trigger us, what
are our motivations

00:43:06.150 --> 00:43:09.520 align:middle line:84%
for doing X, Y, Z, why are
we doing what we're doing?

00:43:09.520 --> 00:43:13.140 align:middle line:84%
And then be able to call
shots from a place of being

00:43:13.140 --> 00:43:17.022 align:middle line:84%
fully informed, and fully
engaged, and fully inspired.

00:43:17.022 --> 00:43:18.480 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: And as
you said earlier,

00:43:18.480 --> 00:43:23.270 align:middle line:84%
that has to start with what
you can perceive as the success

00:43:23.270 --> 00:43:24.404 align:middle line:90%
that already exists.

00:43:24.404 --> 00:43:25.820 align:middle line:84%
When you knew you
knew you knew, I

00:43:25.820 --> 00:43:29.750 align:middle line:84%
think you said, were there was
something where you knew and it

00:43:29.750 --> 00:43:31.010 align:middle line:90%
turned out to be true.

00:43:31.010 --> 00:43:33.410 align:middle line:84%
That's exactly
what was going on.

00:43:33.410 --> 00:43:38.120 align:middle line:84%
And so building from there, then
let's talk about the process

00:43:38.120 --> 00:43:41.100 align:middle line:84%
that you use for
engaging more dialogue,

00:43:41.100 --> 00:43:44.030 align:middle line:84%
more listening to the
whispers of the higher mind.

00:43:44.030 --> 00:43:45.020 align:middle line:90%
>> BARSOTTI: Beautiful.

00:43:45.020 --> 00:43:50.250 align:middle line:84%
So guided imagery, guided
meditations, is one mechanism.

00:43:50.250 --> 00:43:53.360 align:middle line:84%
Oftentimes what I'm listening
for, keenly, in a person

00:43:53.360 --> 00:43:56.630 align:middle line:84%
is, where am I hearing
something else be inserted?

00:43:56.630 --> 00:43:58.910 align:middle line:84%
And then I'm bringing
the logical mind

00:43:58.910 --> 00:44:01.595 align:middle line:90%
to presence with that.

00:44:01.595 --> 00:44:05.360 align:middle line:84%
But that then depends
on me, and I'm

00:44:05.360 --> 00:44:08.967 align:middle line:84%
trying to learn how to exit
myself out of the system,

00:44:08.967 --> 00:44:10.550 align:middle line:84%
because it's all
about teaching people

00:44:10.550 --> 00:44:12.110 align:middle line:90%
to do this for themselves.

00:44:12.110 --> 00:44:16.940 align:middle line:84%
So when I give somebody a
tool such as a meditation

00:44:16.940 --> 00:44:21.020 align:middle line:84%
and I record the session, and
they can go back and listen

00:44:21.020 --> 00:44:25.580 align:middle line:84%
to it as often as they need
to in order to get the a-has,

00:44:25.580 --> 00:44:30.380 align:middle line:84%
there's so much more said than
is currently consciously being

00:44:30.380 --> 00:44:31.620 align:middle line:90%
registered.

00:44:31.620 --> 00:44:33.870 align:middle line:84%
And it's like, the
session continues.

00:44:33.870 --> 00:44:35.904 align:middle line:84%
So this guided imagery,
guided meditation--

00:44:35.904 --> 00:44:37.820 align:middle line:84%
it's not guided imagery,
I shouldn't say that.

00:44:37.820 --> 00:44:42.110 align:middle line:84%
It's a guided meditation
that is really phenomenal,

00:44:42.110 --> 00:44:45.080 align:middle line:84%
because the person that
says I've never done this,

00:44:45.080 --> 00:44:46.890 align:middle line:90%
I've never been successful.

00:44:46.890 --> 00:44:48.890 align:middle line:84%
And yet where did all
that just come from?

00:44:48.890 --> 00:44:50.360 align:middle line:90%
I couldn't make this up.

00:44:50.360 --> 00:44:50.540 align:middle line:90%
Could I?

00:44:50.540 --> 00:44:51.320 align:middle line:90%
Could I make it up?

00:44:51.320 --> 00:44:52.140 align:middle line:90%
Am I making it up?

00:44:52.140 --> 00:44:54.830 align:middle line:84%
And I was like, you
can't really make it up.

00:44:54.830 --> 00:44:59.060 align:middle line:84%
Go back and listen, and
you will hear the wisdom

00:44:59.060 --> 00:45:01.390 align:middle line:90%
that's being offered to you.

00:45:01.390 --> 00:45:02.850 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Yes.

00:45:02.850 --> 00:45:06.210 align:middle line:84%
One little tidbit in
that I like to share,

00:45:06.210 --> 00:45:08.870 align:middle line:84%
whether I'm doing a workshop or
a lecture or whatnot, is this.

00:45:08.870 --> 00:45:10.280 align:middle line:90%
It's so simple.

00:45:10.280 --> 00:45:15.860 align:middle line:84%
That your days are peppered with
these little sparks of desire,

00:45:15.860 --> 00:45:17.780 align:middle line:84%
and we usually don't
think much of it.

00:45:17.780 --> 00:45:20.510 align:middle line:84%
We usually say, oh, it's
nice, and ride past it,

00:45:20.510 --> 00:45:22.260 align:middle line:90%
I don't have time for that.

00:45:22.260 --> 00:45:24.700 align:middle line:90%
You don't really dial in.

00:45:24.700 --> 00:45:28.060 align:middle line:84%
And all of these little moments
of desire, these little sparks,

00:45:28.060 --> 00:45:30.140 align:middle line:90%
like, oh, that's beautiful.

00:45:30.140 --> 00:45:32.920 align:middle line:84%
It's inviting you to engage
with that moment on some level.

00:45:32.920 --> 00:45:33.720 align:middle line:90%
It can be anything.

00:45:33.720 --> 00:45:38.060 align:middle line:84%
It can be a mother tickling
her little baby or something.

00:45:38.060 --> 00:45:40.700 align:middle line:84%
To move into that,
because that's

00:45:40.700 --> 00:45:42.500 align:middle line:84%
putting off a frequency
that your being is

00:45:42.500 --> 00:45:44.430 align:middle line:90%
desiring in that moment.

00:45:44.430 --> 00:45:46.790 align:middle line:90%
To anything.

00:45:46.790 --> 00:45:50.810 align:middle line:84%
To getting this whim that passes
through, in my case, like,

00:45:50.810 --> 00:45:53.315 align:middle line:84%
so-and-so is blue, bake them
something and take it over

00:45:53.315 --> 00:45:54.160 align:middle line:90%
or whatever.

00:45:54.160 --> 00:45:54.530 align:middle line:90%
You know?

00:45:54.530 --> 00:45:55.330 align:middle line:90%
>> BARSOTTI: Yeah.

00:45:55.330 --> 00:45:57.950 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: But all these little
sparks of desire are working

00:45:57.950 --> 00:46:03.890 align:middle line:84%
toward a refined connection with
the higher mind and the more

00:46:03.890 --> 00:46:07.280 align:middle line:84%
ordinary lower mind, or common,
every day, conscious mind.

00:46:07.280 --> 00:46:12.350 align:middle line:84%
And just listening and following
these little sparks of desire

00:46:12.350 --> 00:46:15.650 align:middle line:84%
actually open up much larger
pathways for communications

00:46:15.650 --> 00:46:18.090 align:middle line:84%
beyond these little
momentary things.

00:46:18.090 --> 00:46:19.362 align:middle line:90%
So please expand on that.

00:46:19.362 --> 00:46:20.570 align:middle line:90%
>> BARSOTTI: Yeah, thank you.

00:46:20.570 --> 00:46:24.170 align:middle line:84%
This is so key, because
that's inspiration.

00:46:24.170 --> 00:46:26.660 align:middle line:84%
And sometimes when I'm
working with people

00:46:26.660 --> 00:46:28.790 align:middle line:84%
that have been steeped in
the Buddhist tradition,

00:46:28.790 --> 00:46:31.490 align:middle line:84%
right, they've been
taught that desire is bad.

00:46:31.490 --> 00:46:33.550 align:middle line:90%
And I'm like, no!

00:46:33.550 --> 00:46:35.684 align:middle line:84%
OK, the very thought
of you saying

00:46:35.684 --> 00:46:37.100 align:middle line:84%
that you don't
want to have desire

00:46:37.100 --> 00:46:38.270 align:middle line:90%
is still having a desire.

00:46:38.270 --> 00:46:42.020 align:middle line:84%
So how do you unite
yourself from that knot?

00:46:42.020 --> 00:46:45.290 align:middle line:84%
But the point is, is
that spirituality,

00:46:45.290 --> 00:46:51.740 align:middle line:84%
or being inspired, it's the
animation of spirit within us.

00:46:51.740 --> 00:46:56.270 align:middle line:84%
And to be inspired is to have
the breath of that spirit,

00:46:56.270 --> 00:46:57.380 align:middle line:90%
in spiritu.

00:46:57.380 --> 00:46:58.640 align:middle line:90%
It's the breath of life.

00:46:58.640 --> 00:47:01.070 align:middle line:84%
So those little
nuggets of desire,

00:47:01.070 --> 00:47:04.640 align:middle line:84%
of inspiration to follow,
go take this to somebody,

00:47:04.640 --> 00:47:07.760 align:middle line:84%
say this something, compliment
this person in this way,

00:47:07.760 --> 00:47:08.810 align:middle line:90%
follow it.

00:47:08.810 --> 00:47:09.980 align:middle line:90%
It's so dynamic.

00:47:09.980 --> 00:47:11.480 align:middle line:90%
Thank you for saying that.

00:47:11.480 --> 00:47:15.620 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: Well, and it does
create a larger highway of data

00:47:15.620 --> 00:47:18.050 align:middle line:84%
flowing through than these
simple little things.

00:47:18.050 --> 00:47:20.900 align:middle line:84%
It begins developing
that beautiful trust

00:47:20.900 --> 00:47:23.390 align:middle line:84%
factor between the
everyday experience

00:47:23.390 --> 00:47:25.270 align:middle line:84%
and the whisperings
of the higher mind.

00:47:25.270 --> 00:47:27.770 align:middle line:84%
And what better way to do it
than through an invitation that

00:47:27.770 --> 00:47:30.710 align:middle line:84%
has a beautiful desire attached
to it than someone trying

00:47:30.710 --> 00:47:32.360 align:middle line:90%
to pound it down your throat?

00:47:32.360 --> 00:47:33.186 align:middle line:90%
You know.

00:47:33.186 --> 00:47:34.310 align:middle line:90%
That's no way to get there.

00:47:34.310 --> 00:47:36.710 align:middle line:84%
You need to do this, you
have to do this, that's not

00:47:36.710 --> 00:47:38.280 align:middle line:90%
a pathway to open exploration.

00:47:38.280 --> 00:47:39.080 align:middle line:90%
>> BARSOTTI: No.

00:47:39.080 --> 00:47:40.240 align:middle line:90%
And shoulds.

00:47:40.240 --> 00:47:43.230 align:middle line:84%
Shoulds, ought to,
need to, have to.

00:47:43.230 --> 00:47:44.030 align:middle line:90%
These are--

00:47:44.030 --> 00:47:46.210 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: Those are like
poison to the spirit.

00:47:46.210 --> 00:47:48.330 align:middle line:84%
>> BARSOTTI: Well,
It's actually ego.

00:47:48.330 --> 00:47:52.820 align:middle line:84%
And I like the definition
of edging god out,

00:47:52.820 --> 00:47:55.400 align:middle line:84%
but the ego is meant to
be incorporated, right?

00:47:55.400 --> 00:47:57.510 align:middle line:84%
Because we still need
to have a sense of self.

00:47:57.510 --> 00:48:01.130 align:middle line:84%
So these ought to,
should, need to, have to--

00:48:01.130 --> 00:48:04.670 align:middle line:84%
what I love the saying is, is
that what we said at school is,

00:48:04.670 --> 00:48:06.953 align:middle line:84%
thou shall not
should on thyself.

00:48:06.953 --> 00:48:08.037 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHTER]

00:48:08.037 --> 00:48:10.370 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: So let's say, OK,
you have a deadline coming,

00:48:10.370 --> 00:48:12.495 align:middle line:84%
and maybe you've been
procrastinating a little, oh,

00:48:12.495 --> 00:48:14.480 align:middle line:84%
I really should get
around to this, whatever.

00:48:14.480 --> 00:48:16.331 align:middle line:90%
How do you deal with that?

00:48:16.331 --> 00:48:17.330 align:middle line:90%
>> BARSOTTI: Priorities.

00:48:17.330 --> 00:48:19.670 align:middle line:84%
Look at what needs
to be prioritized.

00:48:19.670 --> 00:48:23.350 align:middle line:84%
All of us, we could ourselves
in the pants, oftentimes.

00:48:23.350 --> 00:48:26.320 align:middle line:84%
I know that I need to--
but if you don't have,

00:48:26.320 --> 00:48:28.660 align:middle line:84%
really, the energy
lined up to do it,

00:48:28.660 --> 00:48:32.025 align:middle line:84%
go do something that gives
yourself a discharge.

00:48:32.025 --> 00:48:33.150 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: You're right on.

00:48:33.150 --> 00:48:33.950 align:middle line:90%
>> BARSOTTI: Right?

00:48:33.950 --> 00:48:38.440 align:middle line:84%
Give yourself an opportunity
to go and do something else

00:48:38.440 --> 00:48:40.120 align:middle line:90%
and then come back to it.

00:48:40.120 --> 00:48:42.200 align:middle line:84%
Einstein got the
theory of relativity--

00:48:42.200 --> 00:48:45.840 align:middle line:84%
whether right or wrong, that's
a side conversation-- riding

00:48:45.840 --> 00:48:46.840 align:middle line:90%
his bicycle.

00:48:46.840 --> 00:48:47.800 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Right.

00:48:47.800 --> 00:48:49.300 align:middle line:90%
That's where-- there's a book--

00:48:49.300 --> 00:48:52.446 align:middle line:84%
God, I read it 20 years
ago-- on the inspirations

00:48:52.446 --> 00:48:54.320 align:middle line:84%
of all the great
breakthroughs that happened.

00:48:54.320 --> 00:48:57.200 align:middle line:84%
They were all riding a bus,
dreaming, on their bicycle,

00:48:57.200 --> 00:48:58.000 align:middle line:90%
or whatnot.

00:48:58.000 --> 00:48:59.791 align:middle line:84%
When they were freeing
themselves-- and I'm

00:48:59.791 --> 00:49:01.930 align:middle line:90%
a big devotee of this.

00:49:01.930 --> 00:49:04.260 align:middle line:84%
If I'm putting something
off and procrastinating,

00:49:04.260 --> 00:49:08.120 align:middle line:84%
the time is here, then I go do
something else that I enjoy.

00:49:08.120 --> 00:49:08.920 align:middle line:90%
That's it.

00:49:08.920 --> 00:49:10.630 align:middle line:84%
And then I'm refreshed,
and it's like, OK.

00:49:10.630 --> 00:49:12.160 align:middle line:84%
Make yourself a cup of
tea and let's get at it.

00:49:12.160 --> 00:49:13.035 align:middle line:90%
>> BARSOTTI: Exactly.

00:49:13.035 --> 00:49:15.262 align:middle line:90%
Imagination, it's so important.

00:49:15.262 --> 00:49:17.470 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: You have to
refresh the soul with things--

00:49:17.470 --> 00:49:20.400 align:middle line:84%
the spirit with the things that
we do desire and that we do

00:49:20.400 --> 00:49:21.200 align:middle line:90%
enjoy.

00:49:21.200 --> 00:49:22.825 align:middle line:84%
>> BARSOTTI: And this
is usually where?

00:49:22.825 --> 00:49:25.900 align:middle line:84%
When we get into those shoulds,
ought to, need to, have to,

00:49:25.900 --> 00:49:27.970 align:middle line:84%
take a page from
the inner child.

00:49:27.970 --> 00:49:30.540 align:middle line:84%
Because the inner child
is probably tugging,

00:49:30.540 --> 00:49:32.872 align:middle line:84%
let's get outside,
let's go do something.

00:49:32.872 --> 00:49:34.550 align:middle line:84%
Let's distract
ourselves for a moment

00:49:34.550 --> 00:49:35.950 align:middle line:90%
and then come back to it.

00:49:35.950 --> 00:49:37.270 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: I think
mine is alive and well.

00:49:37.270 --> 00:49:38.770 align:middle line:84%
OK, we have a few
minutes left, but I

00:49:38.770 --> 00:49:40.186 align:middle line:84%
wanted to get to
this other-- it's

00:49:40.186 --> 00:49:43.430 align:middle line:84%
another Guthrie and Carish I
think were their names, right?

00:49:43.430 --> 00:49:45.514 align:middle line:84%
They teach another four
kind of architects,

00:49:45.514 --> 00:49:46.930 align:middle line:84%
and this is kind
of fun, you know,

00:49:46.930 --> 00:49:48.805 align:middle line:84%
if people are reading
your papers or whatnot,

00:49:48.805 --> 00:49:50.900 align:middle line:84%
and this is the elemental,
devic, outer spatial,

00:49:50.900 --> 00:49:54.610 align:middle line:84%
and angelic archetypes, of which
most of us are a combination.

00:49:54.610 --> 00:49:57.560 align:middle line:84%
But let's talk about why you
find that particular system

00:49:57.560 --> 00:49:58.360 align:middle line:90%
of value.

00:49:58.360 --> 00:50:01.510 align:middle line:84%
>> BARSOTTI: Oh it's so handy,
because as we are a blend

00:50:01.510 --> 00:50:04.439 align:middle line:84%
of these energies,
when we meet--

00:50:04.439 --> 00:50:05.980 align:middle line:84%
and I've met a lot
of them, because I

00:50:05.980 --> 00:50:07.450 align:middle line:90%
used to be in technology--

00:50:07.450 --> 00:50:09.580 align:middle line:90%
so outer spatial types.

00:50:09.580 --> 00:50:12.250 align:middle line:84%
They happen to be
wired for being

00:50:12.250 --> 00:50:15.790 align:middle line:84%
able to do technological
things, but not always

00:50:15.790 --> 00:50:18.674 align:middle line:90%
are they sociably wired, right?

00:50:18.674 --> 00:50:21.340 align:middle line:84%
They're sometimes uncomfortable,
that's not how they want to do.

00:50:21.340 --> 00:50:22.140 align:middle line:90%
So it's--

00:50:22.140 --> 00:50:24.550 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: Can you just stay
with the logic of what I was

00:50:24.550 --> 00:50:26.000 align:middle line:90%
talking about, please?

00:50:26.000 --> 00:50:27.580 align:middle line:90%
No deviations, please.

00:50:27.580 --> 00:50:30.270 align:middle line:84%
>> BARSOTTI: Don't challenge me
to have an interrelationship--

00:50:30.270 --> 00:50:31.540 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: There are
time I have that, too.

00:50:31.540 --> 00:50:33.650 align:middle line:84%
No, no, I'm just trying to
stay with this line of thought.

00:50:33.650 --> 00:50:35.899 align:middle line:84%
And other people want to
have fun and go other places,

00:50:35.899 --> 00:50:37.210 align:middle line:90%
and I have to adjust.

00:50:37.210 --> 00:50:38.200 align:middle line:90%
>> BARSOTTI: Exactly.

00:50:38.200 --> 00:50:41.260 align:middle line:84%
So the outer spatial type
is that type of person.

00:50:41.260 --> 00:50:43.630 align:middle line:84%
Well, the best way to relate
to an outer spatial type

00:50:43.630 --> 00:50:45.280 align:middle line:90%
is to compliment them.

00:50:45.280 --> 00:50:46.900 align:middle line:90%
Ground them in.

00:50:46.900 --> 00:50:49.200 align:middle line:84%
Find something to
praise them about.

00:50:49.200 --> 00:50:51.070 align:middle line:84%
Compliment may be
too strong of a word,

00:50:51.070 --> 00:50:53.200 align:middle line:84%
praise is like, I
appreciate the work

00:50:53.200 --> 00:50:54.880 align:middle line:90%
that you did on bla-de-bla.

00:50:54.880 --> 00:50:57.370 align:middle line:84%
That code you wrote for
this was just pure genius.

00:50:57.370 --> 00:50:58.780 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: So what does
this-- how does this break

00:50:58.780 --> 00:50:59.680 align:middle line:90%
the pattern?

00:50:59.680 --> 00:51:02.320 align:middle line:84%
>> BARSOTTI: What it does is,
it says that you see them.

00:51:02.320 --> 00:51:04.000 align:middle line:84%
You see them for
who they are, you're

00:51:04.000 --> 00:51:05.245 align:middle line:90%
not trying to change them.

00:51:05.245 --> 00:51:07.120 align:middle line:84%
But what the outer
spatials are here to learn

00:51:07.120 --> 00:51:10.860 align:middle line:84%
is how to have an emotional
experience on Earth.

00:51:10.860 --> 00:51:12.730 align:middle line:90%
Well, they're overwhelmed.

00:51:12.730 --> 00:51:15.064 align:middle line:84%
So we can help them by just
giving them a little praise,

00:51:15.064 --> 00:51:17.396 align:middle line:84%
by telling them that we see
them and we acknowledge them

00:51:17.396 --> 00:51:18.320 align:middle line:90%
for who they are.

00:51:18.320 --> 00:51:19.720 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: So let's
talk about the devic.

00:51:19.720 --> 00:51:21.410 align:middle line:84%
We'll go through each
one, because it's fun.

00:51:21.410 --> 00:51:22.210 align:middle line:90%
>> BARSOTTI: It is.

00:51:22.210 --> 00:51:23.570 align:middle line:90%
I find it so helpful.

00:51:23.570 --> 00:51:26.374 align:middle line:84%
And I give this
list of attributes

00:51:26.374 --> 00:51:27.790 align:middle line:84%
to people, especially
in business,

00:51:27.790 --> 00:51:30.160 align:middle line:84%
to help them relate to
their employees better.

00:51:30.160 --> 00:51:32.260 align:middle line:84%
And you know if you're
hiring the right person

00:51:32.260 --> 00:51:34.570 align:middle line:84%
in the right frame,
when you know

00:51:34.570 --> 00:51:38.000 align:middle line:84%
that they're a dominant
person, let's say, is devic.

00:51:38.000 --> 00:51:41.530 align:middle line:84%
So the devic type are
the highly creative.

00:51:41.530 --> 00:51:44.035 align:middle line:90%
They love projects.

00:51:44.035 --> 00:51:47.002 align:middle line:90%
And we all have devic in us.

00:51:47.002 --> 00:51:48.960 align:middle line:84%
Our mental judge self
and our astral judge self

00:51:48.960 --> 00:51:50.590 align:middle line:90%
are primarily devic.

00:51:50.590 --> 00:51:53.080 align:middle line:84%
Love sinking our
teeth into things.

00:51:53.080 --> 00:51:55.900 align:middle line:84%
Well, they need
to be acknowledged

00:51:55.900 --> 00:51:58.501 align:middle line:84%
for their creative abilities,
but what can happen

00:51:58.501 --> 00:52:00.250 align:middle line:84%
is sort of the shadow
aspect, is that they

00:52:00.250 --> 00:52:03.730 align:middle line:84%
can get lost in the deva
aspects, where they're just

00:52:03.730 --> 00:52:08.740 align:middle line:84%
show off in la la land having
the experience of being

00:52:08.740 --> 00:52:10.990 align:middle line:84%
creative that they
forget to be grounded,

00:52:10.990 --> 00:52:12.850 align:middle line:84%
and that's where the
elemental comes in.

00:52:12.850 --> 00:52:13.990 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: OK.

00:52:13.990 --> 00:52:14.790 align:middle line:90%
Talk about that.

00:52:14.790 --> 00:52:16.360 align:middle line:84%
So the elemental
are literally coming

00:52:16.360 --> 00:52:17.680 align:middle line:90%
from the elemental kingdom.

00:52:17.680 --> 00:52:19.910 align:middle line:84%
Steiner spoke a lot
about this, right?

00:52:19.910 --> 00:52:22.570 align:middle line:84%
So the elemental
kingdom is literally

00:52:22.570 --> 00:52:25.090 align:middle line:84%
of the rocks, of the
earth, of minerals,

00:52:25.090 --> 00:52:27.010 align:middle line:90%
and they ground us in.

00:52:27.010 --> 00:52:30.370 align:middle line:84%
So let's say that there's
a couple of-- at odds here.

00:52:30.370 --> 00:52:33.250 align:middle line:84%
When we all-- usually
we have this combination

00:52:33.250 --> 00:52:35.800 align:middle line:84%
of elemental and devic that
want to play the game together.

00:52:35.800 --> 00:52:39.010 align:middle line:84%
Well, if we're especially
being devic, and not elemental

00:52:39.010 --> 00:52:41.530 align:middle line:84%
enough, it's very frustrating
for the elemental part.

00:52:41.530 --> 00:52:44.730 align:middle line:84%
So the elemental, if we
acknowledge it, can say, OK.

00:52:44.730 --> 00:52:47.020 align:middle line:84%
Help me be grounded in
the fact that I actually

00:52:47.020 --> 00:52:48.670 align:middle line:90%
need to get this, now, done.

00:52:48.670 --> 00:52:51.700 align:middle line:84%
I don't want to just continue
off and end up in Pluto

00:52:51.700 --> 00:52:53.730 align:middle line:84%
by the time I get done
with this project.

00:52:53.730 --> 00:52:55.810 align:middle line:84%
I need to still
ground it in reality.

00:52:55.810 --> 00:52:58.640 align:middle line:84%
And our elemental parts
can help us do that.

00:52:58.640 --> 00:53:01.380 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: Let's talk
about the angelic parts.

00:53:01.380 --> 00:53:05.440 align:middle line:84%
>> BARSOTTI: Yeah, so the
angelic is both the shadow

00:53:05.440 --> 00:53:09.220 align:middle line:84%
and the light side,
very highly resourced.

00:53:09.220 --> 00:53:11.660 align:middle line:90%
And we can so--

00:53:11.660 --> 00:53:14.440 align:middle line:84%
a good example is somebody
who thinks that time is just

00:53:14.440 --> 00:53:18.070 align:middle line:84%
a mere suggestion,
and the angelic types

00:53:18.070 --> 00:53:20.470 align:middle line:84%
are the type that,
like, we have plenty.

00:53:20.470 --> 00:53:22.040 align:middle line:84%
We don't need to
worry about that.

00:53:22.040 --> 00:53:24.260 align:middle line:84%
It's coming, it's all
good, but it may not

00:53:24.260 --> 00:53:26.330 align:middle line:90%
be very grounded in reality.

00:53:26.330 --> 00:53:32.600 align:middle line:84%
It's great to have the belief,
but it may not be actualizable

00:53:32.600 --> 00:53:38.322 align:middle line:84%
And the angelic will help give
us the aha that, oh, my god,

00:53:38.322 --> 00:53:39.530 align:middle line:90%
this is going to be possible.

00:53:39.530 --> 00:53:41.090 align:middle line:90%
We can attain that goal.

00:53:41.090 --> 00:53:44.060 align:middle line:84%
It's like the impossible,
impossible dream,

00:53:44.060 --> 00:53:47.419 align:middle line:84%
and the angelic can help us
actually dream the impossible.

00:53:47.419 --> 00:53:49.460 align:middle line:84%
And then we need the other
parts to actually help

00:53:49.460 --> 00:53:50.514 align:middle line:90%
it be realized.

00:53:50.514 --> 00:53:52.430 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: The shadow
side of that I noticed--

00:53:52.430 --> 00:53:54.980 align:middle line:84%
because I live in Sedona, and
there are a lot of angelic

00:53:54.980 --> 00:54:00.140 align:middle line:84%
types, but the other
side of that is delusion.

00:54:00.140 --> 00:54:03.770 align:middle line:84%
It's like, no, it doesn't
actually work like that.

00:54:03.770 --> 00:54:06.440 align:middle line:84%
If you don't engage
the other parts,

00:54:06.440 --> 00:54:10.230 align:middle line:84%
you're just going to be drifting
and living in your car soon.

00:54:10.230 --> 00:54:11.480 align:middle line:90%
And there's a lot of that.

00:54:11.480 --> 00:54:13.610 align:middle line:84%
>> BARSOTTI: And that's exactly
what we're talking about,

00:54:13.610 --> 00:54:14.410 align:middle line:90%
right?

00:54:14.410 --> 00:54:17.390 align:middle line:84%
We're just thinking, oh, my next
thing will arrive, it'll be OK,

00:54:17.390 --> 00:54:20.750 align:middle line:84%
but they haven't done
anything to take action.

00:54:20.750 --> 00:54:23.750 align:middle line:84%
And it's great to be in
such faith and trust,

00:54:23.750 --> 00:54:25.610 align:middle line:84%
that's a beautiful
thing, but we have

00:54:25.610 --> 00:54:30.140 align:middle line:84%
to do it with some assembly
of the total picture and not

00:54:30.140 --> 00:54:31.575 align:middle line:90%
just--

00:54:31.575 --> 00:54:33.200 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: Where
heaven and earth meet.

00:54:33.200 --> 00:54:35.810 align:middle line:84%
>> BARSOTTI: Where heaven
and earth meet, well said.

00:54:35.810 --> 00:54:38.990 align:middle line:84%
And that would be, if our
angelic parts can get along

00:54:38.990 --> 00:54:40.640 align:middle line:84%
with our elemental
parts can get along

00:54:40.640 --> 00:54:43.820 align:middle line:84%
with our outer spatial parts can
get along with our devic parts,

00:54:43.820 --> 00:54:46.489 align:middle line:84%
now we've got all parts of
the puzzle working together.

00:54:46.489 --> 00:54:47.530 align:middle line:90%
>> TIFFANY BARSOTTI: Yes.

00:54:47.530 --> 00:54:49.770 align:middle line:84%
OK, now, we only have
a few minutes left.

00:54:49.770 --> 00:54:52.730 align:middle line:84%
Let's just address-- because
everyone deals with it--

00:54:52.730 --> 00:54:56.090 align:middle line:84%
when these kinds of basic fears
that grip us and sabotage just

00:54:56.090 --> 00:54:58.370 align:middle line:84%
come up from the
subconscious because

00:54:58.370 --> 00:55:01.730 align:middle line:84%
of its fear of annihilation
and enslavement,

00:55:01.730 --> 00:55:04.610 align:middle line:84%
what is the best way to
engage with those kind

00:55:04.610 --> 00:55:08.270 align:middle line:84%
of gut-gripping
situations that come up?

00:55:08.270 --> 00:55:11.340 align:middle line:84%
And you know they're dragging
you back down, you can feel it.

00:55:11.340 --> 00:55:12.140 align:middle line:90%
>> BARSOTTI: Yes.

00:55:12.140 --> 00:55:14.600 align:middle line:90%
So immediately, say thank you.

00:55:14.600 --> 00:55:17.580 align:middle line:84%
You don't even know
why it's happening,

00:55:17.580 --> 00:55:21.530 align:middle line:84%
but to start shifting the
energy towards thank you.

00:55:21.530 --> 00:55:26.010 align:middle line:84%
We were just recently in
Tibet, a travel day from hell--

00:55:26.010 --> 00:55:26.810 align:middle line:90%
getting back.

00:55:26.810 --> 00:55:27.710 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: From
the lower realms.

00:55:27.710 --> 00:55:28.150 align:middle line:90%
>> BARSOTTI: Right.

00:55:28.150 --> 00:55:30.450 align:middle line:84%
And I was literally jumping
up and down in the airport,

00:55:30.450 --> 00:55:31.750 align:middle line:90%
like, no, we're going to--

00:55:31.750 --> 00:55:36.807 align:middle line:84%
anyway, I had to shift to
say, just say thank you.

00:55:36.807 --> 00:55:38.390 align:middle line:84%
I don't know why I'm
saying thank you,

00:55:38.390 --> 00:55:39.848 align:middle line:84%
but there's always
something for us

00:55:39.848 --> 00:55:42.139 align:middle line:90%
to learn in these situations.

00:55:42.139 --> 00:55:44.180 align:middle line:84%
And so I'm trying to get
it right then and there,

00:55:44.180 --> 00:55:48.080 align:middle line:84%
but let me take something
that's not so just travel day.

00:55:48.080 --> 00:55:54.600 align:middle line:84%
Something that is a true, like,
oh my god, this is happening--

00:55:54.600 --> 00:55:56.870 align:middle line:84%
or it's happening
again, where we're

00:55:56.870 --> 00:55:59.480 align:middle line:84%
just sort of stripped
of all of who we

00:55:59.480 --> 00:56:02.120 align:middle line:90%
think that we were capable of.

00:56:02.120 --> 00:56:03.530 align:middle line:90%
There's a reason for it.

00:56:03.530 --> 00:56:05.270 align:middle line:84%
And we may not be
able to see it,

00:56:05.270 --> 00:56:09.260 align:middle line:84%
but if we just ground ourselves
into whatever that moment is

00:56:09.260 --> 00:56:12.560 align:middle line:84%
and just say, I know that there
is something for me to learn

00:56:12.560 --> 00:56:15.350 align:middle line:84%
and extract from it,
I know that there

00:56:15.350 --> 00:56:17.210 align:middle line:90%
is something for me to get.

00:56:17.210 --> 00:56:21.530 align:middle line:84%
Master Du-al Kul, which is some
of what my thesis was based on,

00:56:21.530 --> 00:56:27.680 align:middle line:84%
those teachings, when I work
with him and he comes through,

00:56:27.680 --> 00:56:31.170 align:middle line:84%
the question is always,
what are you learning?

00:56:31.170 --> 00:56:32.400 align:middle line:90%
What are you learning?

00:56:32.400 --> 00:56:34.922 align:middle line:84%
And you may not be
able to ask yourself

00:56:34.922 --> 00:56:35.880 align:middle line:90%
that in those moments--

00:56:35.880 --> 00:56:37.100 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: Maybe it
comes in a dream.

00:56:37.100 --> 00:56:37.575 align:middle line:90%
>> BARSOTTI: It does.

00:56:37.575 --> 00:56:39.120 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: Maybe it
makes sense tomorrow.

00:56:39.120 --> 00:56:39.995 align:middle line:90%
>> BARSOTTI: Exactly.

00:56:39.995 --> 00:56:42.660 align:middle line:84%
But if you just open
yourself up to the idea

00:56:42.660 --> 00:56:44.780 align:middle line:84%
that there could be
some other reasons

00:56:44.780 --> 00:56:45.780 align:middle line:90%
that this is happening--

00:56:45.780 --> 00:56:48.540 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: And don't react in
the moment and shut it down.

00:56:48.540 --> 00:56:51.820 align:middle line:84%
Don't shut the possibility
down that's showing itself.

00:56:51.820 --> 00:56:52.744 align:middle line:90%
So you thank it.

00:56:52.744 --> 00:56:53.660 align:middle line:90%
>> BARSOTTI: Thank it.

00:56:53.660 --> 00:56:56.270 align:middle line:84%
That immediately
shifts the energy.

00:56:56.270 --> 00:56:57.070 align:middle line:90%
Immediately.

00:56:57.070 --> 00:56:59.430 align:middle line:10%
And you know, my beloved,
I'm so lucky that I actually

00:56:59.430 --> 00:57:04.110 align:middle line:10%
get to work with my divine
love, and that's Paul Mills,

00:57:04.110 --> 00:57:07.740 align:middle line:10%
and he's a scientist at UCSD.

00:57:07.740 --> 00:57:09.210 align:middle line:10%
He actually did
gratitude research,

00:57:09.210 --> 00:57:12.610 align:middle line:10%
and showed that the inflammatory
changes at the heart

00:57:12.610 --> 00:57:15.040 align:middle line:10%
change as soon as you
go into gratitude.

00:57:15.040 --> 00:57:17.280 align:middle line:84%
I mean, there's
biomedical research

00:57:17.280 --> 00:57:19.320 align:middle line:84%
that says as soon as
we go into gratitude

00:57:19.320 --> 00:57:22.050 align:middle line:84%
we shift the whole
neurotransmitter

00:57:22.050 --> 00:57:26.519 align:middle line:84%
cascade into something that
changes for the positive.

00:57:26.519 --> 00:57:28.560 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: You can feel
the cascade in your body.

00:57:28.560 --> 00:57:29.550 align:middle line:90%
>> BARSOTTI: You can.

00:57:29.550 --> 00:57:31.830 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: So on that
note, any final thoughts?

00:57:31.830 --> 00:57:33.340 align:middle line:90%
Because we're out of time.

00:57:33.340 --> 00:57:34.535 align:middle line:90%
This has been really fun.

00:57:34.535 --> 00:57:35.410 align:middle line:90%
>> BARSOTTI: Love it.

00:57:35.410 --> 00:57:36.750 align:middle line:10%
Thank you so much.

00:57:36.750 --> 00:57:40.050 align:middle line:10%
That piece with the archetypes
of survival to the archetypes

00:57:40.050 --> 00:57:43.310 align:middle line:10%
of grace and evolving,
those archetypes--

00:57:43.310 --> 00:57:46.120 align:middle line:10%
>> REGINA: You talked about
bits of methods to do that,

00:57:46.120 --> 00:57:47.490 align:middle line:10%
but go ahead.

00:57:47.490 --> 00:57:53.254 align:middle line:84%
>> BARSOTTI: That piece is on
Huffington Post and SFGate,

00:57:53.254 --> 00:57:54.420 align:middle line:90%
the San Francisco Chronicle.

00:57:54.420 --> 00:57:55.260 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: Well, it's
on your site, isn't it?

00:57:55.260 --> 00:57:56.259 align:middle line:90%
So you have links to it?

00:57:56.259 --> 00:57:57.330 align:middle line:90%
>> BARSOTTI: I did, yes.

00:57:57.330 --> 00:58:00.526 align:middle line:10%
We invited Deepak Chopra, and
Paul and I-- the three of us

00:58:00.526 --> 00:58:01.900 align:middle line:10%
really wrote that
piece together.

00:58:01.900 --> 00:58:03.483 align:middle line:10%
So I'm going to be
expounding on that,

00:58:03.483 --> 00:58:05.940 align:middle line:10%
and I'm working on a book
for it-- those ideas.

00:58:05.940 --> 00:58:07.170 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Excellent.

00:58:07.170 --> 00:58:09.927 align:middle line:84%
OK, well I'll send
people there right now.

00:58:09.927 --> 00:58:11.760 align:middle line:84%
Thanks so much Tiffany,
we'll do this again.

00:58:11.760 --> 00:58:13.030 align:middle line:90%
I always love chatting with you.

00:58:13.030 --> 00:58:13.170 align:middle line:90%
>> BARSOTTI: Me too.

00:58:13.170 --> 00:58:14.580 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: It's
really beautiful.

00:58:14.580 --> 00:58:16.450 align:middle line:10%
Again, to connect with
