00:00:21.902 --> 00:00:24.110 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA MEREDITH: One of
the biggest archaeological

00:00:24.110 --> 00:00:26.690 align:middle line:84%
controversies of the past
several years has been

00:00:26.690 --> 00:00:30.120 align:middle line:84%
the authenticity of what are
called the Bosnian pyramids.

00:00:30.120 --> 00:00:33.060 align:middle line:84%
Those in academic circles
have been calling it a hoax.

00:00:33.060 --> 00:00:35.310 align:middle line:84%
The problem is, all
but a few have not

00:00:35.310 --> 00:00:37.420 align:middle line:84%
taken the time to go
to the site to examine

00:00:37.420 --> 00:00:38.920 align:middle line:90%
the evidence for themselves.

00:00:38.920 --> 00:00:40.140 align:middle line:90%
But we did.

00:00:40.140 --> 00:00:43.340 align:middle line:84%
The man who took it upon
himself to begin the excavation

00:00:43.340 --> 00:00:46.640 align:middle line:84%
is Dr. Semir Osmanagich,
a scholar in Mayan history

00:00:46.640 --> 00:00:48.170 align:middle line:90%
and a native to Bosnia.

00:00:48.170 --> 00:00:50.590 align:middle line:84%
When we met with Semir,
we were in for a shock

00:00:50.590 --> 00:00:52.820 align:middle line:84%
and became the first
media in the world

00:00:52.820 --> 00:00:55.840 align:middle line:84%
to learn of what is now believed
to be the oldest pyramid to be

00:00:55.840 --> 00:00:58.660 align:middle line:84%
discovered, by many
thousands of years.

00:00:58.660 --> 00:01:01.710 align:middle line:84%
The implications are such
that this discovery may

00:01:01.710 --> 00:01:04.700 align:middle line:84%
call for a complete rewrite
of our human history.

00:01:04.700 --> 00:01:08.050 align:middle line:84%
Join me now in
Bosnia with Semir.

00:01:08.050 --> 00:01:09.760 align:middle line:84%
Semir, it's so good
to be here with you.

00:01:09.760 --> 00:01:13.270 align:middle line:10%
And it was absolutely marvelous
being out in the tunnels,

00:01:13.270 --> 00:01:17.145 align:middle line:10%
just to get that incredibly
clean, fresh air in our lungs.

00:01:17.145 --> 00:01:19.980 align:middle line:90%


00:01:19.980 --> 00:01:21.860 align:middle line:84%
What's interesting
about this story

00:01:21.860 --> 00:01:23.710 align:middle line:84%
to me is if anyone
right now watching this

00:01:23.710 --> 00:01:27.100 align:middle line:84%
were to go onto the internet
and start researching

00:01:27.100 --> 00:01:29.180 align:middle line:84%
Bosnian pyramids, one
of the first things

00:01:29.180 --> 00:01:33.810 align:middle line:84%
that's going to pop up
is Bosnian pyramid hoax.

00:01:33.810 --> 00:01:34.880 align:middle line:90%
You know?

00:01:34.880 --> 00:01:36.120 align:middle line:90%
It's a hoax.

00:01:36.120 --> 00:01:39.410 align:middle line:10%
And yet clearly, once someone
takes the time and trouble

00:01:39.410 --> 00:01:42.070 align:middle line:10%
to come here,
there's not a hoax.

00:01:42.070 --> 00:01:46.790 align:middle line:10%
And you've been dealing
with this since 2005.

00:01:46.790 --> 00:01:49.120 align:middle line:84%
And let's talk
about how-- first,

00:01:49.120 --> 00:01:51.350 align:middle line:84%
there are a lot of
little pyramid--

00:01:51.350 --> 00:01:53.930 align:middle line:84%
several pyramid-looking
mountains there, right?

00:01:53.930 --> 00:01:56.080 align:middle line:84%
How did you first
become alerted enough

00:01:56.080 --> 00:01:58.555 align:middle line:84%
to go to the trouble
to start excavation?

00:01:58.555 --> 00:02:00.222 align:middle line:84%
And tell us about
your background a bit.

00:02:00.222 --> 00:02:02.430 align:middle line:84%
>> SEMIR OSMANAGICH: First
of all, welcome to Bosnia.

00:02:02.430 --> 00:02:03.390 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Thank you.

00:02:03.390 --> 00:02:05.765 align:middle line:84%
>> OSMANAGICH: I've been
dealing with the pyramid science

00:02:05.765 --> 00:02:07.270 align:middle line:90%
for about 25 years now.

00:02:07.270 --> 00:02:10.330 align:middle line:10%
My PhD is in Mayan
studies, which

00:02:10.330 --> 00:02:13.910 align:middle line:10%
means that I spend a lot of
time in the jungles of Honduras,

00:02:13.910 --> 00:02:17.260 align:middle line:10%
Guatemala, El Salvador,
Belize, and Mexico.

00:02:17.260 --> 00:02:20.115 align:middle line:84%
I've seen hundreds and
hundreds of pyramids

00:02:20.115 --> 00:02:24.440 align:middle line:84%
in forests, completely covered
by soil and vegetation.

00:02:24.440 --> 00:02:29.030 align:middle line:84%
250 pyramids in China, also
completely covered by soil.

00:02:29.030 --> 00:02:31.830 align:middle line:84%
So I realized that
the pyramids are not

00:02:31.830 --> 00:02:35.550 align:middle line:84%
all like the ones on Giza
Plateau, in a desert,

00:02:35.550 --> 00:02:37.530 align:middle line:90%
visible to everyone.

00:02:37.530 --> 00:02:41.840 align:middle line:84%
Then the next thing, you realize
that Egyptian pyramids are not

00:02:41.840 --> 00:02:43.900 align:middle line:84%
built as the tombs
for the pharaohs.

00:02:43.900 --> 00:02:45.510 align:middle line:90%
No hieroglyphic writings.

00:02:45.510 --> 00:02:46.480 align:middle line:90%
No symbols.

00:02:46.480 --> 00:02:47.210 align:middle line:90%
No tools.

00:02:47.210 --> 00:02:48.950 align:middle line:90%
No organic materials.

00:02:48.950 --> 00:02:50.170 align:middle line:90%
No mummies.

00:02:50.170 --> 00:02:53.120 align:middle line:84%
Then you ask yourself, hey,
if the pyramids are not

00:02:53.120 --> 00:02:56.040 align:middle line:84%
only native to Mexico
but all over the planet

00:02:56.040 --> 00:02:59.260 align:middle line:84%
on all six continents,
what was their purpose?

00:02:59.260 --> 00:03:01.880 align:middle line:84%
And obviously there
was a communication

00:03:01.880 --> 00:03:06.070 align:middle line:84%
on global level
thousands of years back.

00:03:06.070 --> 00:03:09.740 align:middle line:84%
So once I've seen and written
about so many pyramids,

00:03:09.740 --> 00:03:13.980 align:middle line:84%
I came to Bosnia in
the spring of 2005.

00:03:13.980 --> 00:03:17.570 align:middle line:84%
They invited me to come to this
central Bosnian town of Visoko,

00:03:17.570 --> 00:03:18.821 align:middle line:90%
only 20 miles northwest--

00:03:18.821 --> 00:03:21.320 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: When you say "they"
invited you, who invited you?

00:03:21.320 --> 00:03:23.560 align:middle line:84%
>> OSMANAGICH: The director
of the local museum.

00:03:23.560 --> 00:03:26.210 align:middle line:84%
They wanted me to
see the local museum.

00:03:26.210 --> 00:03:27.390 align:middle line:90%
I came there.

00:03:27.390 --> 00:03:32.980 align:middle line:10%
But once I saw that hill
towering the town, which is now

00:03:32.980 --> 00:03:35.970 align:middle line:10%
known as the Bosnian
Pyramid of the Sun,

00:03:35.970 --> 00:03:39.730 align:middle line:10%
even though it was covered
in forest and soil and dirt,

00:03:39.730 --> 00:03:43.940 align:middle line:10%
when I saw the geometry--
four sides, triangular

00:03:43.940 --> 00:03:49.850 align:middle line:10%
faces, the same slope on
all sides, obvious corners--

00:03:49.850 --> 00:03:51.270 align:middle line:10%
I took the compass to my hand.

00:03:51.270 --> 00:03:53.550 align:middle line:90%
I put it in front of me.

00:03:53.550 --> 00:03:57.270 align:middle line:84%
And the compass showed me
that the sides perfectly

00:03:57.270 --> 00:04:01.370 align:middle line:84%
matched the cardinal points,
east, west, north, and south.

00:04:01.370 --> 00:04:02.870 align:middle line:84%
And that's exactly
how the pyramids

00:04:02.870 --> 00:04:06.840 align:middle line:84%
were built in China,
the oldest one in Egypt,

00:04:06.840 --> 00:04:10.650 align:middle line:84%
in Peru, Cahokia pyramids
in the state of Illinois.

00:04:10.650 --> 00:04:15.170 align:middle line:84%
So I knew that it was an
artificial structure, covered

00:04:15.170 --> 00:04:17.820 align:middle line:84%
by soil after
thousands of years.

00:04:17.820 --> 00:04:22.050 align:middle line:84%
And then I decided to start
the project of investigation.

00:04:22.050 --> 00:04:24.320 align:middle line:84%
I was hiring the
core drilling drew.

00:04:24.320 --> 00:04:26.610 align:middle line:84%
Then I was ready to
write my first book

00:04:26.610 --> 00:04:29.170 align:middle line:84%
about the discovery
of Bosnian pyramids.

00:04:29.170 --> 00:04:31.230 align:middle line:90%
That was October of 2005.

00:04:31.230 --> 00:04:33.600 align:middle line:84%
I announced the
news to the world.

00:04:33.600 --> 00:04:36.300 align:middle line:84%
And thousands of people
wrote me in emails.

00:04:36.300 --> 00:04:37.841 align:middle line:90%
They wanted to be part of it.

00:04:37.841 --> 00:04:39.090 align:middle line:90%
They wanted to do the support.

00:04:39.090 --> 00:04:41.060 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: I remember when
it came out in the mainstream

00:04:41.060 --> 00:04:41.395 align:middle line:90%
news.

00:04:41.395 --> 00:04:41.730 align:middle line:90%
>> OSMANAGICH: Yes.

00:04:41.730 --> 00:04:42.396 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Yeah.

00:04:42.396 --> 00:04:44.760 align:middle line:84%
>> OSMANAGICH: And at
that time I said, well,

00:04:44.760 --> 00:04:47.200 align:middle line:90%
this is not a one-man show.

00:04:47.200 --> 00:04:50.380 align:middle line:84%
This discovery
belongs to everyone.

00:04:50.380 --> 00:04:52.470 align:middle line:84%
I established
nonprofit foundation.

00:04:52.470 --> 00:04:57.690 align:middle line:84%
And ever since, we got the
umbrella for this huge project.

00:04:57.690 --> 00:05:02.000 align:middle line:84%
And the last seven
years, from 2005 to 2012,

00:05:02.000 --> 00:05:05.710 align:middle line:84%
it has become the most
active archaeological site

00:05:05.710 --> 00:05:11.290 align:middle line:84%
in the world, every year
500, 600 volunteers coming

00:05:11.290 --> 00:05:14.290 align:middle line:84%
from all continents
to little Bosnia,

00:05:14.290 --> 00:05:16.575 align:middle line:84%
the country that was
known for the war

00:05:16.575 --> 00:05:20.562 align:middle line:84%
and the violence and
corruption, all the bad stuff.

00:05:20.562 --> 00:05:25.120 align:middle line:84%
But now with this project,
we talk about archaeology,

00:05:25.120 --> 00:05:28.750 align:middle line:84%
about tourism, about
volunteers, about nice stuff.

00:05:28.750 --> 00:05:32.200 align:middle line:84%
So we want to change the
image of the whole country

00:05:32.200 --> 00:05:33.540 align:middle line:90%
for the better.

00:05:33.540 --> 00:05:35.600 align:middle line:84%
So you did mention
discovery and how

00:05:35.600 --> 00:05:37.520 align:middle line:84%
it was received by
mainstream media

00:05:37.520 --> 00:05:39.670 align:middle line:90%
and the cultural establishment.

00:05:39.670 --> 00:05:42.070 align:middle line:84%
Unfortunately,
all the professors

00:05:42.070 --> 00:05:46.470 align:middle line:84%
of archaeology, history,
geology here locally in Bosnia,

00:05:46.470 --> 00:05:48.130 align:middle line:84%
instead of supporting
the project

00:05:48.130 --> 00:05:50.460 align:middle line:84%
or at least trying to
become a part of it,

00:05:50.460 --> 00:05:53.610 align:middle line:84%
trying to do their
part in the research,

00:05:53.610 --> 00:05:55.810 align:middle line:90%
they decided to attack us.

00:05:55.810 --> 00:05:58.800 align:middle line:84%
They were writing petitions
trying to stop the project.

00:05:58.800 --> 00:06:01.520 align:middle line:10%
But fortunately, the
Bosnian prime minister,

00:06:01.520 --> 00:06:04.130 align:middle line:10%
the Bosnian government who
came to the site, they said,

00:06:04.130 --> 00:06:07.860 align:middle line:10%
hey, we have some
artificially made blocks.

00:06:07.860 --> 00:06:10.360 align:middle line:90%
We have a lot of tourists.

00:06:10.360 --> 00:06:11.860 align:middle line:90%
This is good for country.

00:06:11.860 --> 00:06:15.050 align:middle line:84%
So just keep working
on this project,

00:06:15.050 --> 00:06:17.687 align:middle line:84%
and don't worry about
the jealous scientists.

00:06:17.687 --> 00:06:20.020 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: Now, you told a
story off-camera when we were

00:06:20.020 --> 00:06:26.330 align:middle line:84%
in the tunnels the other day
about one of the journalists--

00:06:26.330 --> 00:06:28.610 align:middle line:84%
I think he was an
archaeologist here in Bosnia--

00:06:28.610 --> 00:06:31.260 align:middle line:84%
went on the camera
and had a book.

00:06:31.260 --> 00:06:35.670 align:middle line:84%
Can you tell that story to try
to dismiss the fact that this

00:06:35.670 --> 00:06:37.559 align:middle line:90%
may be a genuine discovery?

00:06:37.559 --> 00:06:38.350 align:middle line:90%
>> OSMANAGICH: Yes.

00:06:38.350 --> 00:06:41.330 align:middle line:84%
What we had, we had
history professors here.

00:06:41.330 --> 00:06:43.510 align:middle line:84%
And they were showing
these encyclopedias

00:06:43.510 --> 00:06:45.930 align:middle line:90%
written in the 1960s.

00:06:45.930 --> 00:06:48.180 align:middle line:84%
And he was saying,
well, in this book

00:06:48.180 --> 00:06:50.680 align:middle line:84%
we have all the
archaeological sites in Bosnia

00:06:50.680 --> 00:06:51.920 align:middle line:90%
and the former Yugoslavia.

00:06:51.920 --> 00:06:54.810 align:middle line:84%
On this site, we don't
have Bosnian pyramids.

00:06:54.810 --> 00:06:57.390 align:middle line:90%
Therefore, they don't exist.

00:06:57.390 --> 00:07:01.600 align:middle line:84%
Now, the book was written
40, 50, 60 years ago.

00:07:01.600 --> 00:07:03.390 align:middle line:84%
Now, is it possible
that you have

00:07:03.390 --> 00:07:05.850 align:middle line:84%
all the archaeological
sites in the books?

00:07:05.850 --> 00:07:07.010 align:middle line:90%
Of course not.

00:07:07.010 --> 00:07:08.520 align:middle line:84%
Then it would mean
that everything

00:07:08.520 --> 00:07:10.460 align:middle line:90%
has been discovered already.

00:07:10.460 --> 00:07:12.920 align:middle line:84%
Where is the place
for the science?

00:07:12.920 --> 00:07:17.090 align:middle line:84%
So we have to stay open for
the new discoveries always.

00:07:17.090 --> 00:07:19.260 align:middle line:84%
It doesn't matter
what position we have.

00:07:19.260 --> 00:07:21.900 align:middle line:90%
It doesn't matter how we are.

00:07:21.900 --> 00:07:24.770 align:middle line:84%
We simply need to be
ready for new discoveries.

00:07:24.770 --> 00:07:28.810 align:middle line:84%
And then, and only then,
there is a hope for us.

00:07:28.810 --> 00:07:31.170 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: In all ways
we have to remain open.

00:07:31.170 --> 00:07:33.290 align:middle line:84%
But what's interesting
to me in this is here

00:07:33.290 --> 00:07:37.790 align:middle line:84%
you have a country that
has been so ravaged by war.

00:07:37.790 --> 00:07:41.650 align:middle line:84%
I mean, when you look outside,
the one startling feature

00:07:41.650 --> 00:07:43.870 align:middle line:84%
driving through Sarajevo
is there are cemeteries

00:07:43.870 --> 00:07:44.430 align:middle line:90%
everywhere.

00:07:44.430 --> 00:07:46.840 align:middle line:84%
And there are a lot
of new headstones

00:07:46.840 --> 00:07:48.880 align:middle line:90%
from the 1990s and the war.

00:07:48.880 --> 00:07:51.580 align:middle line:84%
You lost a good percentage
of the population.

00:07:51.580 --> 00:07:56.430 align:middle line:84%
So you would think, given that,
with something so amazing right

00:07:56.430 --> 00:08:00.690 align:middle line:84%
in the backyard here, that the
Bosnian establishment would

00:08:00.690 --> 00:08:04.010 align:middle line:84%
welcome the thought that there's
something new to be discovered

00:08:04.010 --> 00:08:06.912 align:middle line:84%
and to bring people
in to examine.

00:08:06.912 --> 00:08:08.245 align:middle line:90%
I don't understand this mindset.

00:08:08.245 --> 00:08:09.869 align:middle line:84%
>> OSMANAGICH: That's
the common sense.

00:08:09.869 --> 00:08:12.090 align:middle line:84%
And a matter of fact,
the common people,

00:08:12.090 --> 00:08:14.910 align:middle line:90%
they do support the project.

00:08:14.910 --> 00:08:17.310 align:middle line:84%
But then when it comes to
the cultural establishment,

00:08:17.310 --> 00:08:19.690 align:middle line:90%
they have their own interests.

00:08:19.690 --> 00:08:23.650 align:middle line:84%
And some of them, like the
local historians, geologists,

00:08:23.650 --> 00:08:26.490 align:middle line:84%
archaeologists, they do not
even realize that they were just

00:08:26.490 --> 00:08:30.530 align:middle line:84%
the tools from
some elite centers.

00:08:30.530 --> 00:08:32.799 align:middle line:84%
And basically they were
doing the dirty job,

00:08:32.799 --> 00:08:34.763 align:middle line:90%
trying to stop this project.

00:08:34.763 --> 00:08:36.179 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: Now,
did some of them--

00:08:36.179 --> 00:08:38.554 align:middle line:84%
certainly they must have come
out to examine some of this

00:08:38.554 --> 00:08:39.767 align:middle line:90%
for themselves.

00:08:39.767 --> 00:08:41.850 align:middle line:84%
>> OSMANAGICH: Most of
them, even though they live

00:08:41.850 --> 00:08:44.450 align:middle line:84%
in Sarajevo, which is only
20 miles from the site,

00:08:44.450 --> 00:08:46.280 align:middle line:90%
they never came to Visoko.

00:08:46.280 --> 00:08:48.820 align:middle line:84%
But they claim, oh,
we know the terrain.

00:08:48.820 --> 00:08:49.960 align:middle line:90%
We did some research.

00:08:49.960 --> 00:08:51.450 align:middle line:90%
There is nothing there.

00:08:51.450 --> 00:08:56.110 align:middle line:84%
I mean, what's wrong about it
to come and see for yourself

00:08:56.110 --> 00:08:57.720 align:middle line:90%
and say, hey, maybe I was wrong.

00:08:57.720 --> 00:08:59.880 align:middle line:84%
Let's continue
with the research.

00:08:59.880 --> 00:09:03.645 align:middle line:84%
Unfortunately, sometimes
the ego is just too big

00:09:03.645 --> 00:09:06.140 align:middle line:84%
and doesn't let you do
your scientific work.

00:09:06.140 --> 00:09:09.064 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: Especially if it's
going up against what you have

00:09:09.064 --> 00:09:11.355 align:middle line:84%
already established yourself
in and your own reputation

00:09:11.355 --> 00:09:13.260 align:middle line:90%
in in the world of science.

00:09:13.260 --> 00:09:15.670 align:middle line:10%
>> OSMANAGICH: Unlike any
other archaeological or even

00:09:15.670 --> 00:09:21.120 align:middle line:10%
scientific project, here we try
to view the results from three

00:09:21.120 --> 00:09:24.260 align:middle line:10%
realms, from physical--
based on the physical senses

00:09:24.260 --> 00:09:27.550 align:middle line:10%
and physical science--
energy, and spiritual.

00:09:27.550 --> 00:09:30.310 align:middle line:10%
They're the only way to
understand the structures, not

00:09:30.310 --> 00:09:33.240 align:middle line:10%
only in Bosnia but a lot
of ancient structures.

00:09:33.240 --> 00:09:35.540 align:middle line:84%
And then we approach
the whole project

00:09:35.540 --> 00:09:37.215 align:middle line:90%
with the good intentions.

00:09:37.215 --> 00:09:39.690 align:middle line:84%
For a lot of scientists,
it doesn't mean anything.

00:09:39.690 --> 00:09:42.080 align:middle line:84%
For us, it means
a lot because when

00:09:42.080 --> 00:09:44.000 align:middle line:84%
you go to the ancient
sites, you don't

00:09:44.000 --> 00:09:46.980 align:middle line:84%
want to disturb
certain entities.

00:09:46.980 --> 00:09:51.900 align:middle line:84%
And I think it's helping us to
bring a lot of positive energy.

00:09:51.900 --> 00:09:55.200 align:middle line:84%
And then this
project is so unique

00:09:55.200 --> 00:09:57.980 align:middle line:84%
that even in naming
the pyramids,

00:09:57.980 --> 00:10:00.980 align:middle line:84%
we named one the
Pyramid of Love.

00:10:00.980 --> 00:10:03.640 align:middle line:84%
That was one of the reasons
why some of the archaeologists

00:10:03.640 --> 00:10:05.690 align:middle line:84%
were attacking me,
saying, why is he

00:10:05.690 --> 00:10:08.510 align:middle line:84%
giving such romantic
names to the structures?

00:10:08.510 --> 00:10:12.810 align:middle line:84%
Why didn't he name it Structure
Number 25, for example?

00:10:12.810 --> 00:10:17.380 align:middle line:84%
They don't realize that the
words are very powerful.

00:10:17.380 --> 00:10:20.250 align:middle line:84%
And the most powerful
one is the word "love."

00:10:20.250 --> 00:10:24.980 align:middle line:84%
So when you assign the word
"love" to huge structure,

00:10:24.980 --> 00:10:29.690 align:middle line:84%
the idea is that that word
colors the whole valley

00:10:29.690 --> 00:10:33.070 align:middle line:84%
with such positive
feelings, feelings of love.

00:10:33.070 --> 00:10:34.510 align:middle line:84%
And these are type
of the messages

00:10:34.510 --> 00:10:39.160 align:middle line:84%
that we wanted to send out to
the world, messages of love.

00:10:39.160 --> 00:10:42.750 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: So the world
of archaeology is--

00:10:42.750 --> 00:10:45.760 align:middle line:84%
you're going up against
the current dogma.

00:10:45.760 --> 00:10:48.610 align:middle line:84%
You're also going up
against the notion

00:10:48.610 --> 00:10:52.600 align:middle line:84%
of a crossover between
science and spirituality,

00:10:52.600 --> 00:10:56.720 align:middle line:84%
which it seems to me talking
just here and there with some

00:10:56.720 --> 00:10:59.980 align:middle line:84%
of the people in Bosnia,
there's quite a lot of heart.

00:10:59.980 --> 00:11:03.110 align:middle line:84%
There's an innate
understanding of spirit,

00:11:03.110 --> 00:11:06.432 align:middle line:90%
and people understand this.

00:11:06.432 --> 00:11:07.640 align:middle line:90%
So it would only makes sense.

00:11:07.640 --> 00:11:08.476 align:middle line:90%
You're Bosnian.

00:11:08.476 --> 00:11:10.290 align:middle line:90%
You're from this land.

00:11:10.290 --> 00:11:11.700 align:middle line:84%
It would only make
sense that you

00:11:11.700 --> 00:11:14.370 align:middle line:84%
would be able to tap
in and really feel

00:11:14.370 --> 00:11:16.860 align:middle line:84%
these energies and the
importance of bringing spirit

00:11:16.860 --> 00:11:20.710 align:middle line:84%
back along with just the
hardcore analysis of strata

00:11:20.710 --> 00:11:22.520 align:middle line:84%
and soil samples
and all of that.

00:11:22.520 --> 00:11:24.020 align:middle line:84%
>> OSMANAGICH: And
a matter of fact,

00:11:24.020 --> 00:11:26.910 align:middle line:84%
this discovery will change
so many other things,

00:11:26.910 --> 00:11:29.660 align:middle line:84%
not only on a local
but on a global level.

00:11:29.660 --> 00:11:32.120 align:middle line:84%
So far we thought that the
pyramids were the pharaohs'

00:11:32.120 --> 00:11:36.180 align:middle line:84%
tombs, or they were places to
do some ceremonial sacrifices

00:11:36.180 --> 00:11:37.970 align:middle line:90%
on Mexican soil, and so on.

00:11:37.970 --> 00:11:39.430 align:middle line:90%
This is so wrong.

00:11:39.430 --> 00:11:40.850 align:middle line:90%
It has to be changed.

00:11:40.850 --> 00:11:42.960 align:middle line:84%
By changing that,
basically you're

00:11:42.960 --> 00:11:45.780 align:middle line:84%
changing the current
scientific paradigm.

00:11:45.780 --> 00:11:48.050 align:middle line:84%
The discovery of
Bosnian pyramids,

00:11:48.050 --> 00:11:51.260 align:middle line:84%
being the first one and
the biggest one in Europe,

00:11:51.260 --> 00:11:55.070 align:middle line:84%
means that you're not adding
just one little chapter

00:11:55.070 --> 00:11:56.430 align:middle line:90%
in the history books.

00:11:56.430 --> 00:11:58.945 align:middle line:84%
Because Bosnian
pyramids being probably

00:11:58.945 --> 00:12:02.920 align:middle line:84%
the oldest means that when
you change the beginning,

00:12:02.920 --> 00:12:05.404 align:middle line:84%
everything else that
follows has to be changed.

00:12:05.404 --> 00:12:06.320 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Absolutely.

00:12:06.320 --> 00:12:08.840 align:middle line:84%
>> OSMANAGICH: So you
need to rewrite the books.

00:12:08.840 --> 00:12:10.370 align:middle line:90%
The PhDs are no good.

00:12:10.370 --> 00:12:12.630 align:middle line:90%
Professorships either.

00:12:12.630 --> 00:12:15.660 align:middle line:84%
The way professors
teach our kids,

00:12:15.660 --> 00:12:17.960 align:middle line:84%
all that has to be
changed from little Bosnia

00:12:17.960 --> 00:12:22.110 align:middle line:90%
to Croatia, France, UK, US.

00:12:22.110 --> 00:12:25.365 align:middle line:84%
It was much easier for them
to control this project

00:12:25.365 --> 00:12:28.750 align:middle line:84%
and try to stop it, stop
this little foundation,

00:12:28.750 --> 00:12:30.626 align:middle line:90%
this little guy.

00:12:30.626 --> 00:12:33.240 align:middle line:84%
But unfortunately
for them, we know

00:12:33.240 --> 00:12:36.100 align:middle line:90%
that the truth is on our side.

00:12:36.100 --> 00:12:39.380 align:middle line:84%
We have noble goals
in front of us.

00:12:39.380 --> 00:12:41.870 align:middle line:84%
And that's the reason why
we're going to succeed.

00:12:41.870 --> 00:12:44.080 align:middle line:84%
We opened this
project for everyone.

00:12:44.080 --> 00:12:46.020 align:middle line:90%
No elite science here.

00:12:46.020 --> 00:12:47.912 align:middle line:84%
No selection of
information here.

00:12:47.912 --> 00:12:49.370 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: Anybody
can go in there.

00:12:49.370 --> 00:12:50.911 align:middle line:84%
>> OSMANAGICH:
Anybody can come here.

00:12:50.911 --> 00:12:53.873 align:middle line:84%
As a matter of fact,
we are the only one

00:12:53.873 --> 00:12:57.660 align:middle line:84%
that offered this opportunity
to anyone to come up here,

00:12:57.660 --> 00:13:01.010 align:middle line:84%
but to come to volunteer
to work with us to be

00:13:01.010 --> 00:13:03.910 align:middle line:90%
an active part of discoveries.

00:13:03.910 --> 00:13:06.655 align:middle line:84%
I mean, you cannot just go
like that to Egypt or Mexico

00:13:06.655 --> 00:13:09.310 align:middle line:84%
and start digging
or join their teams.

00:13:09.310 --> 00:13:11.890 align:middle line:84%
I mean, you have to
belong to certain circles.

00:13:11.890 --> 00:13:13.370 align:middle line:90%
You have to be checked out.

00:13:13.370 --> 00:13:17.940 align:middle line:84%
And then, and only then, you can
go there but without talking.

00:13:17.940 --> 00:13:19.617 align:middle line:90%
In our case, no secrets.

00:13:19.617 --> 00:13:21.700 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: No, I see people
coming up with their--

00:13:21.700 --> 00:13:23.991 align:middle line:84%
>> OSMANAGICH: It is an
interaction between volunteers,

00:13:23.991 --> 00:13:27.420 align:middle line:84%
experts, media,
visitors, guests.

00:13:27.420 --> 00:13:28.175 align:middle line:90%
We are so open.

00:13:28.175 --> 00:13:30.690 align:middle line:84%
And you could see the
smiles of the volunteers

00:13:30.690 --> 00:13:32.940 align:middle line:84%
in the Sun Pyramid
and the tunnels.

00:13:32.940 --> 00:13:35.570 align:middle line:84%
People work hard five,
six, seven hours,

00:13:35.570 --> 00:13:38.650 align:middle line:84%
but they always have smile on
their face because they know

00:13:38.650 --> 00:13:40.420 align:middle line:84%
they are part of
something so very--

00:13:40.420 --> 00:13:41.820 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: It's a very
happy-looking lot.

00:13:41.820 --> 00:13:42.611 align:middle line:90%
>> OSMANAGICH: Yes.

00:13:42.611 --> 00:13:44.380 align:middle line:84%
So 10, 20 years
from now, they will

00:13:44.380 --> 00:13:46.800 align:middle line:84%
be talking to their
kids or grandchildren.

00:13:46.800 --> 00:13:48.530 align:middle line:84%
Hey, I was there
in the beginning.

00:13:48.530 --> 00:13:50.006 align:middle line:90%
I did my part.

00:13:50.006 --> 00:13:52.690 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: That's
what strikes me.

00:13:52.690 --> 00:13:54.790 align:middle line:84%
Because it's so
accessible, anyone

00:13:54.790 --> 00:13:55.969 align:middle line:90%
can drive up to that tunnel.

00:13:55.969 --> 00:13:56.760 align:middle line:90%
>> OSMANAGICH: Yes.

00:13:56.760 --> 00:14:00.370 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: And you go in for
just the equivalent of maybe

00:14:00.370 --> 00:14:02.950 align:middle line:84%
a donation of a couple dollars
or something to help with

00:14:02.950 --> 00:14:06.530 align:middle line:84%
the process of the digging,
just some of the basic supplies

00:14:06.530 --> 00:14:08.300 align:middle line:84%
and taking care
of your brochures.

00:14:08.300 --> 00:14:09.413 align:middle line:90%
And anyone can go.

00:14:09.413 --> 00:14:11.000 align:middle line:84%
A family comes
up, and they start

00:14:11.000 --> 00:14:14.210 align:middle line:84%
talking to you or someone else
and take their kids in there.

00:14:14.210 --> 00:14:15.190 align:middle line:90%
There's no block.

00:14:15.190 --> 00:14:16.315 align:middle line:90%
There's no big permissions.

00:14:16.315 --> 00:14:17.273 align:middle line:90%
>> OSMANAGICH: Exactly.

00:14:17.273 --> 00:14:18.570 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: It's so available.

00:14:18.570 --> 00:14:21.226 align:middle line:84%
>> OSMANAGICH: To the
left, there is a tunnel.

00:14:21.226 --> 00:14:23.990 align:middle line:84%
To the right, there
is another one.

00:14:23.990 --> 00:14:26.820 align:middle line:84%
Of course, we have to make
sure that everything we do

00:14:26.820 --> 00:14:28.800 align:middle line:84%
is per our project
documentation.

00:14:28.800 --> 00:14:30.680 align:middle line:84%
You need to get the
permits from the country.

00:14:30.680 --> 00:14:32.040 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: You've got to
have your safety hats on.

00:14:32.040 --> 00:14:32.845 align:middle line:84%
>> OSMANAGICH:
Yeah, safety hats.

00:14:32.845 --> 00:14:34.690 align:middle line:84%
We need to make sure
nothing happens there.

00:14:34.690 --> 00:14:36.812 align:middle line:84%
But then on the other
hand, we are so open

00:14:36.812 --> 00:14:38.300 align:middle line:90%
and we are so different.

00:14:38.300 --> 00:14:41.350 align:middle line:84%
So I think this is
the future of not only

00:14:41.350 --> 00:14:44.700 align:middle line:84%
archaeological excavation but
any other scientific projects.

00:14:44.700 --> 00:14:46.530 align:middle line:90%
Why secrets?

00:14:46.530 --> 00:14:49.890 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: Involve people in
their own intelligence and let

00:14:49.890 --> 00:14:53.130 align:middle line:84%
them decide for themselves,
and also their own intuition.

00:14:53.130 --> 00:14:55.460 align:middle line:84%
And beyond intuition
now, I want to get

00:14:55.460 --> 00:14:58.000 align:middle line:90%
into the hardcore science of it.

00:14:58.000 --> 00:15:01.770 align:middle line:84%
There are five
basic factors that

00:15:01.770 --> 00:15:04.040 align:middle line:84%
are involved in
deciphering whether or not

00:15:04.040 --> 00:15:05.350 align:middle line:90%
something is a genuine pyramid.

00:15:05.350 --> 00:15:06.760 align:middle line:84%
Just run through
those really quickly,

00:15:06.760 --> 00:15:08.176 align:middle line:84%
and then we'll get
to the science.

00:15:08.176 --> 00:15:09.110 align:middle line:90%
>> OSMANAGICH: Yes.

00:15:09.110 --> 00:15:11.840 align:middle line:84%
So if you want to call
something a pyramid,

00:15:11.840 --> 00:15:14.160 align:middle line:90%
we have to have geometry.

00:15:14.160 --> 00:15:18.690 align:middle line:84%
Usually it's four sides,
triangular faces, corners,

00:15:18.690 --> 00:15:19.820 align:middle line:90%
the same slope.

00:15:19.820 --> 00:15:22.320 align:middle line:84%
That's what we have in the
case of Bosnian pyramids.

00:15:22.320 --> 00:15:24.776 align:middle line:90%
The second are the orientation.

00:15:24.776 --> 00:15:28.150 align:middle line:84%
The old pyramids in
China, 250 of them,

00:15:28.150 --> 00:15:30.920 align:middle line:84%
are oriented built
to the cosmic north.

00:15:30.920 --> 00:15:34.210 align:middle line:84%
The oldest, the biggest
Egyptian pyramids, north.

00:15:34.210 --> 00:15:36.450 align:middle line:90%
Peruvian, Cahokia, north.

00:15:36.450 --> 00:15:38.450 align:middle line:84%
So far we've thought
that the best orientation

00:15:38.450 --> 00:15:41.180 align:middle line:84%
is the northern side of
the Great Pyramid of Egypt,

00:15:41.180 --> 00:15:44.995 align:middle line:84%
with an error of zero
degrees and two minutes.

00:15:44.995 --> 00:15:46.120 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: It's so precise.

00:15:46.120 --> 00:15:46.911 align:middle line:90%
>> OSMANAGICH: Yes.

00:15:46.911 --> 00:15:50.210 align:middle line:84%
But in our case, the State
Institute for Geodesy

00:15:50.210 --> 00:15:52.770 align:middle line:84%
came to the top of the
Sun Pyramid in Bosnia,

00:15:52.770 --> 00:15:56.830 align:middle line:84%
measured it, and concluded that
the error to the perfect north

00:15:56.830 --> 00:16:01.590 align:middle line:84%
is zero degrees, zero
minutes, and only 12 seconds.

00:16:01.590 --> 00:16:03.549 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: More precise
than the Giza pyramids.

00:16:03.549 --> 00:16:04.506 align:middle line:90%
>> OSMANAGICH: Exactly.

00:16:04.506 --> 00:16:06.020 align:middle line:84%
It's just a fraction
of one minute.

00:16:06.020 --> 00:16:09.610 align:middle line:84%
This is the most precise
orientation ever on the planet.

00:16:09.610 --> 00:16:11.030 align:middle line:84%
The element number
three, you have

00:16:11.030 --> 00:16:13.870 align:middle line:84%
to have artificial
construction material.

00:16:13.870 --> 00:16:15.690 align:middle line:90%
In Peru, they use adobe bricks.

00:16:15.690 --> 00:16:18.360 align:middle line:84%
In Guatemala, they're shaped
through cutting stones.

00:16:18.360 --> 00:16:20.540 align:middle line:90%
In Mexico, limestone.

00:16:20.540 --> 00:16:22.650 align:middle line:90%
In Egypt, limestone and granite.

00:16:22.650 --> 00:16:27.750 align:middle line:84%
In Bosnia, what they did,
they made concrete blocks.

00:16:27.750 --> 00:16:32.190 align:middle line:84%
This is our archaeological
trench number 4C.

00:16:32.190 --> 00:16:37.360 align:middle line:84%
We have removed approximately
one meter of layers of soil.

00:16:37.360 --> 00:16:39.920 align:middle line:84%
And then we
discovered the blocks.

00:16:39.920 --> 00:16:42.510 align:middle line:84%
This was the first
one to be discovered.

00:16:42.510 --> 00:16:46.830 align:middle line:84%
The blocks, which is rectangular
in the shape, four and a half

00:16:46.830 --> 00:16:53.400 align:middle line:84%
metres in length, one and a half
in width, 45 centimeters thick.

00:16:53.400 --> 00:16:57.910 align:middle line:84%
It has seven tons,
or 16,000 pounds.

00:16:57.910 --> 00:17:04.780 align:middle line:84%
It does have flat top, break
at 90 degrees, flat side,

00:17:04.780 --> 00:17:07.490 align:middle line:90%
break at 90, flat bottom.

00:17:07.490 --> 00:17:11.530 align:middle line:84%
Six flat sides and six
breaks at 90 degrees.

00:17:11.530 --> 00:17:13.030 align:middle line:84%
When they were
building the tunnels,

00:17:13.030 --> 00:17:15.810 align:middle line:84%
they dug out stones,
pebbles, rocks.

00:17:15.810 --> 00:17:18.040 align:middle line:84%
They got the clay
as a binding agent.

00:17:18.040 --> 00:17:21.099 align:middle line:84%
They mixed everything, and
they pulled the concrete blocks

00:17:21.099 --> 00:17:23.069 align:middle line:90%
on the top of the Sun Pyramid.

00:17:23.069 --> 00:17:26.240 align:middle line:84%
The element number
four, inner passageways.

00:17:26.240 --> 00:17:29.010 align:middle line:84%
Our friends, geophysicists
and the georadar specialists

00:17:29.010 --> 00:17:31.330 align:middle line:84%
from Germany, Russia,
Austria, and Serbia,

00:17:31.330 --> 00:17:34.990 align:middle line:84%
they did prove that there is
a network of inner passageways

00:17:34.990 --> 00:17:37.032 align:middle line:84%
and chambers inside
the pyramids.

00:17:37.032 --> 00:17:40.050 align:middle line:84%
The element number five,
underground tunnels.

00:17:40.050 --> 00:17:42.000 align:middle line:84%
You have to have
underground tunnels

00:17:42.000 --> 00:17:44.010 align:middle line:84%
as part of the
whole construction.

00:17:44.010 --> 00:17:47.410 align:middle line:90%
We hit a wall here in 2010.

00:17:47.410 --> 00:17:48.906 align:middle line:90%
It was completely closed.

00:17:48.906 --> 00:17:50.825 align:middle line:90%
And then we hit another wall.

00:17:50.825 --> 00:17:51.700 align:middle line:90%
We removed the walls.

00:17:51.700 --> 00:17:54.280 align:middle line:90%
We removed the free material.

00:17:54.280 --> 00:17:58.240 align:middle line:84%
And after four or five
hours, we could see the hole.

00:17:58.240 --> 00:18:01.650 align:middle line:84%
We removed more material,
and then for the first time

00:18:01.650 --> 00:18:04.640 align:middle line:84%
we found two open
sections, one to the left,

00:18:04.640 --> 00:18:08.660 align:middle line:84%
45 meters, one to the
right, 200 meters.

00:18:08.660 --> 00:18:09.435 align:middle line:90%
>>CREW: Opened?

00:18:09.435 --> 00:18:10.268 align:middle line:90%
>> OSMANAGICH: Open.

00:18:10.268 --> 00:18:12.910 align:middle line:84%
So you have construction
and structures

00:18:12.910 --> 00:18:15.330 align:middle line:90%
above and below the ground.

00:18:15.330 --> 00:18:17.910 align:middle line:84%
So we have a big
master plan when

00:18:17.910 --> 00:18:20.240 align:middle line:84%
they started building
the whole project.

00:18:20.240 --> 00:18:25.200 align:middle line:84%
In the last seven years,
we have spent 300,000 hours

00:18:25.200 --> 00:18:29.550 align:middle line:84%
on archaeological digging,
sample analysis, test analysis,

00:18:29.550 --> 00:18:31.370 align:middle line:90%
and radiocarbon datings.

00:18:31.370 --> 00:18:34.295 align:middle line:10%
And then we concluded
that in Visoko we

00:18:34.295 --> 00:18:36.240 align:middle line:10%
have valley of
pyramids consisting

00:18:36.240 --> 00:18:38.580 align:middle line:10%
of five pyramids which
we named the Bosnian

00:18:38.580 --> 00:18:44.620 align:middle line:10%
Pyramids of the Sun, Moon,
Dragon, Earth, and Love.

00:18:44.620 --> 00:18:46.890 align:middle line:84%
Three pyramids,
Sun, Moon, Dragon,

00:18:46.890 --> 00:18:49.690 align:middle line:84%
they form perfect
equilateral triangle

00:18:49.690 --> 00:18:53.250 align:middle line:84%
when we connect the
tops of these pyramids.

00:18:53.250 --> 00:18:59.000 align:middle line:84%
The distance between them, 2,170
meters, or one and a half mile.

00:18:59.000 --> 00:19:00.940 align:middle line:84%
So this is something
that we can consider

00:19:00.940 --> 00:19:03.760 align:middle line:84%
a sacred geometry,
perfect triangles.

00:19:03.760 --> 00:19:06.060 align:middle line:84%
There is another one
within the bigger one,

00:19:06.060 --> 00:19:09.390 align:middle line:84%
the tops of the Love,
Earth, and the river,

00:19:09.390 --> 00:19:11.350 align:middle line:90%
another equilateral triangle.

00:19:11.350 --> 00:19:15.090 align:middle line:84%
So people did a master
plan before they

00:19:15.090 --> 00:19:18.010 align:middle line:90%
executed the structures.

00:19:18.010 --> 00:19:19.970 align:middle line:84%
And finally, the
element number seven

00:19:19.970 --> 00:19:21.690 align:middle line:90%
is also important, the water.

00:19:21.690 --> 00:19:24.790 align:middle line:84%
You have to have water
above the ground,

00:19:24.790 --> 00:19:26.110 align:middle line:90%
underground water streams.

00:19:26.110 --> 00:19:27.605 align:middle line:90%
You always have the water.

00:19:27.605 --> 00:19:32.790 align:middle line:84%
You see the lake is about
150 square feet of surface

00:19:32.790 --> 00:19:34.320 align:middle line:84%
and about a couple
of feet in depth.

00:19:34.320 --> 00:19:35.655 align:middle line:90%
Can you see the water there?

00:19:35.655 --> 00:19:37.531 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: Oh, that's
the reflective surface.

00:19:37.531 --> 00:19:39.071 align:middle line:84%
>> OSMANAGICH: Yes,
that's the water.

00:19:39.071 --> 00:19:39.770 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Yeah.

00:19:39.770 --> 00:19:41.740 align:middle line:84%
>> OSMANAGICH: When
the pyramid works,

00:19:41.740 --> 00:19:44.360 align:middle line:90%
it acts also as a water pump.

00:19:44.360 --> 00:19:45.780 align:middle line:90%
It sucks the water.

00:19:45.780 --> 00:19:47.960 align:middle line:90%
The water circles everywhere.

00:19:47.960 --> 00:19:51.170 align:middle line:84%
So these are very interesting
not only structures,

00:19:51.170 --> 00:19:55.270 align:middle line:84%
but as we proved here in
Bosnia, they're machines.

00:19:55.270 --> 00:19:58.770 align:middle line:84%
Namely, on the top of the
Bosnian Pyramid of the Sun,

00:19:58.770 --> 00:20:03.710 align:middle line:84%
we had four independent teams
at four different times,

00:20:03.710 --> 00:20:06.400 align:middle line:84%
physicists and
electrical engineers,

00:20:06.400 --> 00:20:09.030 align:middle line:84%
the experts in
energy phenomena who

00:20:09.030 --> 00:20:10.900 align:middle line:90%
were doing the measurements.

00:20:10.900 --> 00:20:15.925 align:middle line:84%
And what they concluded was that
on the top of the Sun Pyramid

00:20:15.925 --> 00:20:19.582 align:middle line:84%
they were able to
detect and measure

00:20:19.582 --> 00:20:22.900 align:middle line:84%
the energy beam,
electromagnetic field coming

00:20:22.900 --> 00:20:28.870 align:middle line:84%
from the pyramid in the radius
of 13 feet of 28 kilohertz

00:20:28.870 --> 00:20:30.240 align:middle line:90%
frequency.

00:20:30.240 --> 00:20:32.840 align:middle line:84%
Now, this is a
frequency which is not

00:20:32.840 --> 00:20:35.220 align:middle line:90%
readily available in the nature.

00:20:35.220 --> 00:20:40.440 align:middle line:84%
So, I mean, you need a machine
to generate this frequency.

00:20:40.440 --> 00:20:41.995 align:middle line:84%
And then the second
energy phenomenon

00:20:41.995 --> 00:20:45.610 align:middle line:84%
that we measured over
there was the ultrasound

00:20:45.610 --> 00:20:48.590 align:middle line:84%
beam, about 30
feet radius, coming

00:20:48.590 --> 00:20:50.610 align:middle line:84%
through the top of
the Sun Pyramid.

00:20:50.610 --> 00:20:54.740 align:middle line:84%
Again, the frequency
28 to 33 kilohertz.

00:20:54.740 --> 00:20:57.780 align:middle line:84%
So since these frequencies
cannot be made by Mother

00:20:57.780 --> 00:20:59.710 align:middle line:84%
Nature-- you have
to have machine--

00:20:59.710 --> 00:21:04.080 align:middle line:84%
the logical conclusion is the
Bosnian Pyramid of the Sun

00:21:04.080 --> 00:21:08.450 align:middle line:84%
isn't only a structure;
it is an energy machine.

00:21:08.450 --> 00:21:10.720 align:middle line:84%
And then once you
have the machine,

00:21:10.720 --> 00:21:12.520 align:middle line:84%
then you can have
those engineers

00:21:12.520 --> 00:21:15.970 align:middle line:84%
trying to explain how
the machine works.

00:21:15.970 --> 00:21:19.060 align:middle line:84%
So what we were doing
in April of 2012,

00:21:19.060 --> 00:21:22.880 align:middle line:84%
we brought about 600 pounds
of equipment-- generators,

00:21:22.880 --> 00:21:25.420 align:middle line:84%
oscilloscopes,
gaussmeters, laptops.

00:21:25.420 --> 00:21:31.140 align:middle line:84%
For 54 hours, we were emitting
the electromagnetic field

00:21:31.140 --> 00:21:34.730 align:middle line:84%
from our generator
to the pyramid.

00:21:34.730 --> 00:21:37.860 align:middle line:84%
So now the physicists said, OK,
if you have one energy machine,

00:21:37.860 --> 00:21:41.720 align:middle line:84%
you have another one, you
emit electromagnetic field,

00:21:41.720 --> 00:21:44.426 align:middle line:84%
basically you can
predict what is

00:21:44.426 --> 00:21:45.800 align:middle line:84%
the strength of
the signal you're

00:21:45.800 --> 00:21:47.860 align:middle line:84%
going to get back
from this machine.

00:21:47.860 --> 00:21:48.390 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: From the resistance.

00:21:48.390 --> 00:21:49.931 align:middle line:84%
>> OSMANAGICH: From
the pyramid, yes.

00:21:49.931 --> 00:21:53.180 align:middle line:84%
And they said it
will be 0.9 volts.

00:21:53.180 --> 00:21:55.070 align:middle line:84%
But what happened
is that the signal

00:21:55.070 --> 00:21:57.240 align:middle line:84%
back, which was
over three volts,

00:21:57.240 --> 00:22:01.070 align:middle line:84%
it was more than
three times stronger.

00:22:01.070 --> 00:22:04.150 align:middle line:84%
Now, the physicists
could not believe.

00:22:04.150 --> 00:22:08.330 align:middle line:84%
So what we have here,
not only that the pyramid

00:22:08.330 --> 00:22:10.740 align:middle line:84%
acts as the energy
machine, but it's

00:22:10.740 --> 00:22:14.170 align:middle line:84%
saying that this is
an intelligent energy

00:22:14.170 --> 00:22:19.210 align:middle line:90%
machine deciding how to react.

00:22:19.210 --> 00:22:20.090 align:middle line:90%
So very interesting.

00:22:20.090 --> 00:22:22.667 align:middle line:84%
So we are opening a completely
new door into science.

00:22:22.667 --> 00:22:24.250 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: And this
is very difficult.

00:22:24.250 --> 00:22:26.310 align:middle line:84%
Now, when you make a
statement like that,

00:22:26.310 --> 00:22:28.372 align:middle line:84%
that's where the tools
don't work anymore.

00:22:28.372 --> 00:22:29.580 align:middle line:90%
>> OSMANAGICH: You are right.

00:22:29.580 --> 00:22:32.390 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: In measuring it, when
you talk about consciousness

00:22:32.390 --> 00:22:35.592 align:middle line:84%
and intelligence, now there's
no measurement just yet.

00:22:35.592 --> 00:22:36.800 align:middle line:90%
>> OSMANAGICH: You are right.

00:22:36.800 --> 00:22:39.120 align:middle line:84%
You know that almost
100 years ago, Einstein

00:22:39.120 --> 00:22:41.255 align:middle line:84%
said everything is
energy in nature.

00:22:41.255 --> 00:22:44.010 align:middle line:90%
Our planet is energy ball.

00:22:44.010 --> 00:22:45.150 align:middle line:90%
We are energy balls.

00:22:45.150 --> 00:22:46.147 align:middle line:90%
The trees are energy.

00:22:46.147 --> 00:22:47.100 align:middle line:90%
But also the pyramids.

00:22:47.100 --> 00:22:48.680 align:middle line:90%
The stones is energy.

00:22:48.680 --> 00:22:52.730 align:middle line:84%
The pyramids are very old
and powerful energies.

00:22:52.730 --> 00:22:56.010 align:middle line:84%
So eventually they got the
consciousness of their own.

00:22:56.010 --> 00:22:58.410 align:middle line:84%
And that's the reason why
we are getting such results.

00:22:58.410 --> 00:23:02.410 align:middle line:84%
So like I said, the only way
to understand these structures

00:23:02.410 --> 00:23:05.050 align:middle line:84%
and these ancient
monuments is to view them

00:23:05.050 --> 00:23:09.470 align:middle line:84%
through three realms: physical,
energy, and spiritual.

00:23:09.470 --> 00:23:12.020 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: And just the sheer
intelligence it took to create

00:23:12.020 --> 00:23:15.750 align:middle line:84%
these and what was put into
there for purpose is part

00:23:15.750 --> 00:23:19.815 align:middle line:84%
of the construct, the field of
intelligence of it, as well.

00:23:19.815 --> 00:23:21.560 align:middle line:90%
>> OSMANAGICH: You are right.

00:23:21.560 --> 00:23:23.750 align:middle line:84%
You know, sometimes
we think that we even

00:23:23.750 --> 00:23:27.730 align:middle line:84%
don't have enough
scientific tools developed

00:23:27.730 --> 00:23:31.440 align:middle line:84%
to understand this project
and these monuments.

00:23:31.440 --> 00:23:34.970 align:middle line:84%
I mean, of course we
have some to kind of get

00:23:34.970 --> 00:23:37.970 align:middle line:84%
to electromagnetic fields,
ultrasound, and so on.

00:23:37.970 --> 00:23:41.750 align:middle line:84%
But how can measure
Orgone, the life energy,

00:23:41.750 --> 00:23:44.360 align:middle line:84%
some other types of
more important energies?

00:23:44.360 --> 00:23:48.800 align:middle line:84%
And it seems that the ancient
beings, the ancient builders,

00:23:48.800 --> 00:23:53.150 align:middle line:84%
knew how to manipulate so
many types of energies.

00:23:53.150 --> 00:23:55.260 align:middle line:84%
And that was the main
purpose of the pyramids

00:23:55.260 --> 00:23:57.730 align:middle line:84%
and the main purpose of
the underground tunnels.

00:23:57.730 --> 00:24:01.860 align:middle line:84%
And we have tens of miles under
the Bosnian pyramid complex,

00:24:01.860 --> 00:24:04.485 align:middle line:90%
most for the energy to flow.

00:24:04.485 --> 00:24:07.360 align:middle line:84%
Got the map of the
underground labyrinth,

00:24:07.360 --> 00:24:09.930 align:middle line:90%
the entrance, tunnels.

00:24:09.930 --> 00:24:12.150 align:middle line:90%
We do clean just a few tunnels.

00:24:12.150 --> 00:24:16.930 align:middle line:84%
Most of them, we
keep them sealed.

00:24:16.930 --> 00:24:21.230 align:middle line:84%
Tens of miles of underground
tunnels and chambers

00:24:21.230 --> 00:24:24.960 align:middle line:84%
and underground
water accumulations.

00:24:24.960 --> 00:24:26.740 align:middle line:84%
So somebody was
able to manipulate

00:24:26.740 --> 00:24:29.240 align:middle line:84%
with the huge
quantities of material.

00:24:29.240 --> 00:24:32.340 align:middle line:84%
And always the purpose
was about the energy.

00:24:32.340 --> 00:24:34.700 align:middle line:84%
Klaus Dona, the great
researcher from Austria,

00:24:34.700 --> 00:24:37.850 align:middle line:84%
in 2011 at our
scientific conference

00:24:37.850 --> 00:24:40.550 align:middle line:84%
brought the georadar
readings of the Sun Pyramid,

00:24:40.550 --> 00:24:44.430 align:middle line:84%
proving that you have tunnels on
seven different levels or seven

00:24:44.430 --> 00:24:49.230 align:middle line:84%
different depths, anywhere
from 15 feet to 1,000 feet.

00:24:49.230 --> 00:24:52.680 align:middle line:84%
And every level is kind
of a little bit moved.

00:24:52.680 --> 00:24:55.099 align:middle line:90%
So it creates a spiral.

00:24:55.099 --> 00:24:56.640 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: Yes, and
I wanted to get--

00:24:56.640 --> 00:24:58.514 align:middle line:84%
>> OSMANAGICH: Spiral
is extremely important.

00:24:58.514 --> 00:25:01.080 align:middle line:84%
When you have this energy
flowing through tunnels,

00:25:01.080 --> 00:25:03.600 align:middle line:84%
getting through the pyramid,
going through the spiral,

00:25:03.600 --> 00:25:07.180 align:middle line:84%
it is a base to
generate the scalar

00:25:07.180 --> 00:25:09.832 align:middle line:84%
waves, the non-Hertzian
technology.

00:25:09.832 --> 00:25:11.040 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Scalar waves, yes.

00:25:11.040 --> 00:25:12.498 align:middle line:84%
>> OSMANAGICH: So
when we measured,

00:25:12.498 --> 00:25:15.550 align:middle line:84%
on the top of the Sun Pyramid,
the strength of the signal,

00:25:15.550 --> 00:25:18.890 align:middle line:84%
first we put our
instruments on the surface.

00:25:18.890 --> 00:25:20.810 align:middle line:90%
It showed certain strength.

00:25:20.810 --> 00:25:22.870 align:middle line:90%
Then we lifted about 10 feet.

00:25:22.870 --> 00:25:25.300 align:middle line:90%
The strength was higher.

00:25:25.300 --> 00:25:26.810 align:middle line:90%
Then another 10 feet.

00:25:26.810 --> 00:25:29.080 align:middle line:90%
Again, the signal was stronger.

00:25:29.080 --> 00:25:30.900 align:middle line:84%
So the physicists,
again, they could not

00:25:30.900 --> 00:25:33.405 align:middle line:84%
understand because
our technology

00:25:33.405 --> 00:25:37.530 align:middle line:84%
in 21st century, which we
can call Hertzian technology,

00:25:37.530 --> 00:25:39.880 align:middle line:84%
tells us that the
closer to the source,

00:25:39.880 --> 00:25:41.120 align:middle line:90%
the stronger the signal.

00:25:41.120 --> 00:25:43.490 align:middle line:84%
You move away, the
signal is getting weaker.

00:25:43.490 --> 00:25:45.710 align:middle line:84%
But now in Bosnia,
it's upside down.

00:25:45.710 --> 00:25:48.310 align:middle line:84%
You move from the source,
it's getting stronger.

00:25:48.310 --> 00:25:49.470 align:middle line:90%
So what does that mean?

00:25:49.470 --> 00:25:51.507 align:middle line:84%
If that signal is
getting stronger

00:25:51.507 --> 00:25:53.090 align:middle line:84%
moving away from the
pyramid, it means

00:25:53.090 --> 00:25:55.600 align:middle line:84%
it can reach any
point in the universe.

00:25:55.600 --> 00:25:58.100 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: It means this has
to be a generator of some kind.

00:25:58.100 --> 00:25:59.910 align:middle line:84%
>> OSMANAGICH: Exactly,
it is a generator.

00:25:59.910 --> 00:26:03.890 align:middle line:84%
Now, the pyramid itself does not
generate energy from nothing.

00:26:03.890 --> 00:26:07.330 align:middle line:84%
It uses natural
sources of energy.

00:26:07.330 --> 00:26:11.020 align:middle line:84%
Of course, one of them is magma
in the core of our planet,

00:26:11.020 --> 00:26:13.025 align:middle line:90%
creating magnetic energy.

00:26:13.025 --> 00:26:15.250 align:middle line:84%
You have underground
water streams,

00:26:15.250 --> 00:26:18.520 align:middle line:84%
and then they
generate energy also.

00:26:18.520 --> 00:26:21.560 align:middle line:84%
So the pyramid sucks those
different types of energy,

00:26:21.560 --> 00:26:22.930 align:middle line:90%
amplifying them.

00:26:22.930 --> 00:26:25.850 align:middle line:84%
Our colleagues from Russia from
Schmidt Institute, Professor

00:26:25.850 --> 00:26:27.830 align:middle line:84%
Khavroshkin and
Professor Tsyplakov,

00:26:27.830 --> 00:26:30.000 align:middle line:84%
they were able to
measure the signal

00:26:30.000 --> 00:26:31.750 align:middle line:84%
on the bottom of a
pyramid-- in Egypt

00:26:31.750 --> 00:26:34.600 align:middle line:90%
and in Bosnia-- and on the top.

00:26:34.600 --> 00:26:41.260 align:middle line:84%
Their conclusion, the signal
on the top is 50 to 500 times

00:26:41.260 --> 00:26:44.390 align:middle line:90%
stronger than on the bottom.

00:26:44.390 --> 00:26:49.160 align:middle line:84%
So it tell us that the ancients
knew the power of geometry

00:26:49.160 --> 00:26:52.430 align:middle line:84%
and all those waves
created by the pyramids.

00:26:52.430 --> 00:26:55.060 align:middle line:10%
>> REGINA: Well, all of this
is absolutely fascinating.

00:26:55.060 --> 00:26:58.120 align:middle line:10%
So we've already gone over
some of the background of how

00:26:58.120 --> 00:26:58.790 align:middle line:10%
this came to be.

00:26:58.790 --> 00:27:02.280 align:middle line:84%
But when you start diving
down into the details,

00:27:02.280 --> 00:27:04.690 align:middle line:84%
we start looking
at the construction

00:27:04.690 --> 00:27:07.070 align:middle line:90%
of the blocks themselves.

00:27:07.070 --> 00:27:10.680 align:middle line:10%
>> OSMANAGICH: Next to
this block is another one.

00:27:10.680 --> 00:27:14.940 align:middle line:10%
They are laid out next to each
other, forming the same slope.

00:27:14.940 --> 00:27:17.630 align:middle line:90%
And the third one, and so on.

00:27:17.630 --> 00:27:20.750 align:middle line:84%
But this is just the
first row of blocks.

00:27:20.750 --> 00:27:26.550 align:middle line:84%
Below is the second, and the
third, and then the fourth.

00:27:26.550 --> 00:27:29.610 align:middle line:90%
One, two, three, four.

00:27:29.610 --> 00:27:31.620 align:middle line:90%
It's not tectonic movement.

00:27:31.620 --> 00:27:34.150 align:middle line:84%
It's the work of the
intelligent hands.

00:27:34.150 --> 00:27:38.990 align:middle line:84%
The mass is seven
tons, or 16,000 pounds.

00:27:38.990 --> 00:27:42.100 align:middle line:84%
Mother Nature does not
make blocks like that.

00:27:42.100 --> 00:27:43.160 align:middle line:90%
It's obvious.

00:27:43.160 --> 00:27:45.120 align:middle line:84%
Some of the geologists
were saying,

00:27:45.120 --> 00:27:48.080 align:middle line:84%
oh, it was the result
of tectonic movements.

00:27:48.080 --> 00:27:50.005 align:middle line:90%
Which is, of course, nonsense.

00:27:50.005 --> 00:27:53.650 align:middle line:84%
Now, you have
obviously the blocks

00:27:53.650 --> 00:27:56.360 align:middle line:84%
that somebody made
in the distant past.

00:27:56.360 --> 00:27:58.360 align:middle line:84%
Now, when you see
the blocks, you

00:27:58.360 --> 00:28:02.750 align:middle line:84%
can see, on the surface,
different colored materials.

00:28:02.750 --> 00:28:06.300 align:middle line:84%
Some of the stones and rocks
and pebbles, they are blue,

00:28:06.300 --> 00:28:09.110 align:middle line:84%
they are red, they are green,
they are brown, they are gray,

00:28:09.110 --> 00:28:11.900 align:middle line:84%
they're white--
different colors.

00:28:11.900 --> 00:28:15.120 align:middle line:10%
In the tunnels, the
conglomerate material

00:28:15.120 --> 00:28:18.390 align:middle line:10%
is exactly the same,
different colored material.

00:28:18.390 --> 00:28:20.190 align:middle line:10%
Then on those
concrete blocks, you

00:28:20.190 --> 00:28:23.700 align:middle line:10%
can see different sizes,
larger pieces, medium-sized,

00:28:23.700 --> 00:28:27.510 align:middle line:10%
smaller pieces, sand, the
same thing in the tunnels.

00:28:27.510 --> 00:28:32.030 align:middle line:84%
So the connection, direct link,
between the tunnel builders

00:28:32.030 --> 00:28:34.030 align:middle line:90%
and pyramid builders is there.

00:28:34.030 --> 00:28:37.905 align:middle line:84%
They removed hundreds of
thousands of tunnel materials

00:28:37.905 --> 00:28:40.290 align:middle line:84%
to build those
underground tunnels.

00:28:40.290 --> 00:28:43.980 align:middle line:84%
What did they do with such
huge quantities of material?

00:28:43.980 --> 00:28:48.710 align:middle line:84%
They used every bit of it
to make the concrete blocks.

00:28:48.710 --> 00:28:51.150 align:middle line:84%
How do you know that
they are concrete?

00:28:51.150 --> 00:28:55.300 align:middle line:10%
We took about 50
samples and sent them

00:28:55.300 --> 00:28:57.755 align:middle line:10%
to six different
labs, institutes

00:28:57.755 --> 00:29:02.630 align:middle line:10%
for materials in Bosnia,
Italy-- Politecnico di Torino--

00:29:02.630 --> 00:29:05.120 align:middle line:10%
and France-- Institute
for Geopolymers,

00:29:05.120 --> 00:29:06.980 align:middle line:10%
which is run by
famous scientist,

00:29:06.980 --> 00:29:08.980 align:middle line:10%
Dr. Joseph Davidovits.

00:29:08.980 --> 00:29:11.450 align:middle line:84%
They all confirmed
the same thing.

00:29:11.450 --> 00:29:13.960 align:middle line:90%
This was a man-made concrete.

00:29:13.960 --> 00:29:16.700 align:middle line:84%
And they explained
us the technology.

00:29:16.700 --> 00:29:18.705 align:middle line:84%
They said besides the
construction material,

00:29:18.705 --> 00:29:21.230 align:middle line:84%
the pebbles and
rocks and sand, they

00:29:21.230 --> 00:29:24.280 align:middle line:90%
used clay as the binding agent.

00:29:24.280 --> 00:29:27.160 align:middle line:84%
A lot of clay around
Bosnian pyramids.

00:29:27.160 --> 00:29:30.170 align:middle line:84%
They ground the clay,
mix it with the water,

00:29:30.170 --> 00:29:32.905 align:middle line:84%
heat it up to 400
degrees, and then clay

00:29:32.905 --> 00:29:35.200 align:middle line:90%
is getting binding properties.

00:29:35.200 --> 00:29:38.750 align:middle line:84%
They knew that in ancient
Rome, 2,000 years ago.

00:29:38.750 --> 00:29:42.100 align:middle line:84%
But also they knew that
in Bosnian pyramid sites

00:29:42.100 --> 00:29:44.680 align:middle line:84%
thousands and thousands
of years before.

00:29:44.680 --> 00:29:47.460 align:middle line:84%
So basically they are
pouring those concrete blocks

00:29:47.460 --> 00:29:51.800 align:middle line:84%
at the site, which is much
more practical and quicker

00:29:51.800 --> 00:29:54.854 align:middle line:84%
than to cut seven-ton blocks
in quarries and then move them.

00:29:54.854 --> 00:29:56.020 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: That makes sense.

00:29:56.020 --> 00:29:58.836 align:middle line:84%
And then also you don't
have debris and, you know,

00:29:58.836 --> 00:29:59.760 align:middle line:90%
mountains of debris.

00:29:59.760 --> 00:30:00.718 align:middle line:90%
>> OSMANAGICH: Exactly.

00:30:00.718 --> 00:30:03.330 align:middle line:84%
So now, when it
comes to concrete,

00:30:03.330 --> 00:30:06.550 align:middle line:84%
two main properties that
determine the qualities

00:30:06.550 --> 00:30:09.210 align:middle line:84%
are the hardness and
the water absorption.

00:30:09.210 --> 00:30:12.760 align:middle line:84%
The harder the concrete,
the better the quality.

00:30:12.760 --> 00:30:15.330 align:middle line:84%
Our modern concretes
in 21st century

00:30:15.330 --> 00:30:19.217 align:middle line:84%
are in the range from 10
megapascals to 60 megapascals.

00:30:19.217 --> 00:30:21.800 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: What is the name of
that unit of measurement again?

00:30:21.800 --> 00:30:22.924 align:middle line:90%
>> OSMANAGICH: Megapascals.

00:30:22.924 --> 00:30:23.940 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: OK.

00:30:23.940 --> 00:30:27.230 align:middle line:84%
>> OSMANAGICH: Now, the samples
from the Sun Pyramid in Bosnia

00:30:27.230 --> 00:30:33.680 align:middle line:84%
are in the range from
73 to 134 megapascals.

00:30:33.680 --> 00:30:35.740 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: So almost
double, double or more.

00:30:35.740 --> 00:30:37.830 align:middle line:84%
>> OSMANAGICH: Two or
three times stronger.

00:30:37.830 --> 00:30:40.630 align:middle line:84%
Two or three times
better quality.

00:30:40.630 --> 00:30:44.370 align:middle line:84%
The second property
is water absorption.

00:30:44.370 --> 00:30:46.980 align:middle line:84%
If water can get into
the concrete blocks

00:30:46.980 --> 00:30:50.540 align:middle line:84%
during the winter, it
freezes and then it breaks.

00:30:50.540 --> 00:30:54.780 align:middle line:84%
So we try to keep the water
absorption as low as possible.

00:30:54.780 --> 00:30:58.670 align:middle line:90%
Our standards are up to 3%.

00:30:58.670 --> 00:31:01.600 align:middle line:84%
In those samples, the concretes
from the Bosnian Pyramid

00:31:01.600 --> 00:31:06.980 align:middle line:84%
of the Sun, the water
absorption is around 1%,

00:31:06.980 --> 00:31:10.310 align:middle line:84%
much more superior
to modern concretes.

00:31:10.310 --> 00:31:14.650 align:middle line:84%
So obviously in the past you
did have advanced civilizations

00:31:14.650 --> 00:31:18.010 align:middle line:84%
who knew how to put
these formulas together

00:31:18.010 --> 00:31:20.560 align:middle line:84%
to make such excellent
quality concrete.

00:31:20.560 --> 00:31:23.880 align:middle line:84%
So the whole pyramid is
covered with the best quality

00:31:23.880 --> 00:31:25.169 align:middle line:90%
concrete on the planet.

00:31:25.169 --> 00:31:26.960 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: And the
problematic part-- well,

00:31:26.960 --> 00:31:28.020 align:middle line:90%
it's not really problematic.

00:31:28.020 --> 00:31:29.228 align:middle line:90%
You don't want to destroy it.

00:31:29.228 --> 00:31:32.460 align:middle line:84%
But it's very difficult
to drill into.

00:31:32.460 --> 00:31:34.134 align:middle line:84%
Didn't you say you
had someone drilling

00:31:34.134 --> 00:31:36.050 align:middle line:84%
a certain part you were
trying to get through?

00:31:36.050 --> 00:31:36.972 align:middle line:90%
Or what was--

00:31:36.972 --> 00:31:38.680 align:middle line:84%
>> OSMANAGICH: Of
course, as a scientist,

00:31:38.680 --> 00:31:40.986 align:middle line:84%
we would like to know more
about the inner structure

00:31:40.986 --> 00:31:41.610 align:middle line:90%
of the pyramid.

00:31:41.610 --> 00:31:44.190 align:middle line:84%
We would like to get inside
to find the passageways

00:31:44.190 --> 00:31:45.910 align:middle line:90%
and chambers and so on.

00:31:45.910 --> 00:31:47.410 align:middle line:84%
According to some
georadar readings,

00:31:47.410 --> 00:31:49.210 align:middle line:84%
we are finding
some of the tunnels

00:31:49.210 --> 00:31:52.416 align:middle line:84%
rather close to the surface,
about 15 to 20 feet.

00:31:52.416 --> 00:31:53.790 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: That's
that one large,

00:31:53.790 --> 00:31:55.695 align:middle line:84%
open area where you
can see down inside.

00:31:55.695 --> 00:31:56.528 align:middle line:90%
>> OSMANAGICH: Yeah.

00:31:56.528 --> 00:31:59.380 align:middle line:84%
So the idea was try to
get into the passageways.

00:31:59.380 --> 00:32:02.900 align:middle line:84%
Now we can see two, maybe
even three layers of concrete.

00:32:02.900 --> 00:32:06.170 align:middle line:84%
So we were able to
remove the first layer.

00:32:06.170 --> 00:32:09.085 align:middle line:84%
Actually, we cut a
small piece, so we

00:32:09.085 --> 00:32:11.090 align:middle line:84%
are able to go a
little bit deeper.

00:32:11.090 --> 00:32:13.900 align:middle line:84%
But now we got to the second
layer of concrete blocks,

00:32:13.900 --> 00:32:17.750 align:middle line:84%
and they are so extremely hard,
you cannot do nothing to them.

00:32:17.750 --> 00:32:20.400 align:middle line:84%
I mean, any drill machine
or Hilti or anything,

00:32:20.400 --> 00:32:22.290 align:middle line:90%
it simply cannot go through.

00:32:22.290 --> 00:32:26.200 align:middle line:84%
Of course, we don't want to use
dynamite or anything like that.

00:32:26.200 --> 00:32:30.720 align:middle line:84%
But it will be hard work to
try to get to the pyramid.

00:32:30.720 --> 00:32:33.525 align:middle line:84%
But then, no rush in
a project like this.

00:32:33.525 --> 00:32:36.220 align:middle line:84%
Eventually we're going to get
it either from the surface

00:32:36.220 --> 00:32:39.750 align:middle line:90%
or from the underground tunnels.

00:32:39.750 --> 00:32:42.676 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: And right now this
is all being done by volunteers.

00:32:42.676 --> 00:32:44.800 align:middle line:10%
>> OSMANAGICH: Like we
said, this is a project open

00:32:44.800 --> 00:32:45.370 align:middle line:10%
for everyone.

00:32:45.370 --> 00:32:46.940 align:middle line:10%
This is excellent experience.

00:32:46.940 --> 00:32:49.370 align:middle line:10%
I mean, coming to
another country, meeting

00:32:49.370 --> 00:32:51.440 align:middle line:10%
with so many young
people, and those

00:32:51.440 --> 00:32:54.140 align:middle line:10%
who are young in their hearts,
from so many countries.

00:32:54.140 --> 00:32:55.730 align:middle line:10%
I mean that's
excellent experience.

00:32:55.730 --> 00:32:56.530 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: What an adventure.

00:32:56.530 --> 00:32:57.230 align:middle line:90%
And it is.

00:32:57.230 --> 00:32:59.690 align:middle line:84%
It's a wonderful
adventure being here.

00:32:59.690 --> 00:33:04.740 align:middle line:84%
So we have this obviously
superior kind of concrete

00:33:04.740 --> 00:33:05.440 align:middle line:90%
that's in there.

00:33:05.440 --> 00:33:08.280 align:middle line:90%
And we see these big blocks.

00:33:08.280 --> 00:33:09.889 align:middle line:90%
And you say they go four deep.

00:33:09.889 --> 00:33:10.680 align:middle line:90%
>> OSMANAGICH: Yes.

00:33:10.680 --> 00:33:14.840 align:middle line:84%
In some cases, they're like
45, 50 centimeters thick.

00:33:14.840 --> 00:33:15.910 align:middle line:90%
You've got four rows.

00:33:15.910 --> 00:33:17.420 align:middle line:84%
In some cases,
some of the blocks

00:33:17.420 --> 00:33:20.760 align:middle line:84%
are 75, 80 centimeters
thick, and have two rows.

00:33:20.760 --> 00:33:24.070 align:middle line:84%
So basically you have
two rows to four rows

00:33:24.070 --> 00:33:25.190 align:middle line:90%
of concrete blocks.

00:33:25.190 --> 00:33:27.810 align:middle line:90%
Then you have clay and clay.

00:33:27.810 --> 00:33:29.660 align:middle line:84%
And the ancients
were very smart.

00:33:29.660 --> 00:33:35.140 align:middle line:84%
They were using clay as a
binder but also as a waterproof

00:33:35.140 --> 00:33:38.550 align:middle line:84%
material, as the
thermal insulation.

00:33:38.550 --> 00:33:42.320 align:middle line:84%
And in the case of
earthquakes, the clay

00:33:42.320 --> 00:33:45.070 align:middle line:84%
gives flexibility
to the structure.

00:33:45.070 --> 00:33:46.850 align:middle line:90%
It does not collapse.

00:33:46.850 --> 00:33:47.800 align:middle line:90%
It breathes.

00:33:47.800 --> 00:33:52.410 align:middle line:84%
So concrete, clay, and then
we have sandstone blocks.

00:33:52.410 --> 00:33:53.970 align:middle line:90%
And then again we have clay.

00:33:53.970 --> 00:33:59.280 align:middle line:84%
And they are all laid out at
the same angle, 35 degrees

00:33:59.280 --> 00:34:01.970 align:middle line:84%
to 45 degrees on
the other two sides.

00:34:01.970 --> 00:34:04.810 align:middle line:84%
So basically you
have the same slope

00:34:04.810 --> 00:34:07.950 align:middle line:84%
from the bottom to the
top of the pyramid.

00:34:07.950 --> 00:34:10.449 align:middle line:84%
Some of the scientists, like
some of the Egyptian scientists

00:34:10.449 --> 00:34:12.150 align:middle line:84%
from the beginning--
Dr. Barakat,

00:34:12.150 --> 00:34:14.949 align:middle line:84%
Dr. Swelim-- thought
that maybe the pyramid

00:34:14.949 --> 00:34:16.960 align:middle line:84%
was a natural hill
in the beginning,

00:34:16.960 --> 00:34:22.080 align:middle line:84%
so it was shaped by people
to get those four triangular

00:34:22.080 --> 00:34:24.250 align:middle line:84%
faces, the perfect
orientation, and then

00:34:24.250 --> 00:34:26.457 align:middle line:90%
it was covered by concrete.

00:34:26.457 --> 00:34:28.540 align:middle line:84%
But the Russians scientists,
Professor Khavroshkin

00:34:28.540 --> 00:34:31.030 align:middle line:84%
and Tsyplakov, using
their instruments,

00:34:31.030 --> 00:34:33.590 align:middle line:84%
they proved that
the whole pyramid

00:34:33.590 --> 00:34:36.989 align:middle line:84%
is built from the
non-compact material.

00:34:36.989 --> 00:34:39.650 align:middle line:84%
If it is not compact,
it means it is not

00:34:39.650 --> 00:34:41.892 align:middle line:84%
the result of
millions of years--

00:34:41.892 --> 00:34:43.350 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: Natural
phenomena, yeah.

00:34:43.350 --> 00:34:44.920 align:middle line:84%
>> OSMANAGICH:
--of accumulation,

00:34:44.920 --> 00:34:49.159 align:middle line:84%
but it was a huge
construction site.

00:34:49.159 --> 00:34:51.000 align:middle line:84%
Of course, the
question is, who was

00:34:51.000 --> 00:34:55.920 align:middle line:84%
able to manipulate with 18
million tons of materials?

00:34:55.920 --> 00:34:59.130 align:middle line:84%
The Cheops, or the Great Pyramid
of Egypt, 5 million tons.

00:34:59.130 --> 00:35:00.642 align:middle line:90%
Here, 18 millions.

00:35:00.642 --> 00:35:05.631 align:middle line:84%
Well obviously, the answer is
more advanced civilization.

00:35:05.631 --> 00:35:07.130 align:middle line:84%
And that's nothing
to be ashamed of.

00:35:07.130 --> 00:35:07.960 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: No, not at all.

00:35:07.960 --> 00:35:08.935 align:middle line:90%
We have to get over that.

00:35:08.935 --> 00:35:10.710 align:middle line:84%
>> OSMANAGICH: If we are not
the most advanced-- you know,

00:35:10.710 --> 00:35:12.650 align:middle line:84%
we think that we are
most intelligent,

00:35:12.650 --> 00:35:14.480 align:middle line:90%
most beautiful ever.

00:35:14.480 --> 00:35:16.046 align:middle line:90%
Well, we are not.

00:35:16.046 --> 00:35:17.680 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: There you go.

00:35:17.680 --> 00:35:18.826 align:middle line:90%
Now, one thing.

00:35:18.826 --> 00:35:20.450 align:middle line:84%
You were talking
about the measurements

00:35:20.450 --> 00:35:21.781 align:middle line:90%
coming out of the top.

00:35:21.781 --> 00:35:24.030 align:middle line:84%
Now, what's interesting is
something else you told us,

00:35:24.030 --> 00:35:27.110 align:middle line:84%
is that in Egypt, the
government will not

00:35:27.110 --> 00:35:29.437 align:middle line:84%
allow measurements of
these kinds to be taken.

00:35:29.437 --> 00:35:31.020 align:middle line:84%
That's one of the
things that's really

00:35:31.020 --> 00:35:33.750 align:middle line:84%
I find intriguing and
beautiful about this project.

00:35:33.750 --> 00:35:35.896 align:middle line:84%
The government's not
shutting you down.

00:35:35.896 --> 00:35:38.020 align:middle line:84%
They're allowing scientists
from all over the world

00:35:38.020 --> 00:35:40.210 align:middle line:90%
to come in and analyze.

00:35:40.210 --> 00:35:43.030 align:middle line:84%
So we don't know what's coming
out of the Pyramid of Giza

00:35:43.030 --> 00:35:45.870 align:middle line:84%
in terms of those--
you say, I think,

00:35:45.870 --> 00:35:48.360 align:middle line:84%
it was 28 kilohertz coming
out of the top of this,

00:35:48.360 --> 00:35:50.430 align:middle line:84%
but we don't know what's
happening in Giza.

00:35:50.430 --> 00:35:51.638 align:middle line:90%
>> OSMANAGICH: Exactly right.

00:35:51.638 --> 00:35:54.460 align:middle line:84%
It's very unfortunate
that you have generations

00:35:54.460 --> 00:35:58.650 align:middle line:84%
of Egyptian scientists, people
who run antiquities in Egypt,

00:35:58.650 --> 00:36:01.430 align:middle line:84%
they don't let
independent researchers

00:36:01.430 --> 00:36:03.960 align:middle line:84%
from all over the world
to come and measure

00:36:03.960 --> 00:36:06.120 align:middle line:90%
ancient energy phenomena.

00:36:06.120 --> 00:36:08.100 align:middle line:84%
In the late 1960s,
when they were

00:36:08.100 --> 00:36:10.480 align:middle line:84%
looking for the passageways
and more chambers

00:36:10.480 --> 00:36:13.490 align:middle line:84%
in the second biggest
pyramid, Khafre Pyramid, when

00:36:13.490 --> 00:36:17.040 align:middle line:84%
the Japanese scientists
realized that every 10

00:36:17.040 --> 00:36:21.880 align:middle line:84%
minutes, the energy field
of that pyramid changes,

00:36:21.880 --> 00:36:23.750 align:middle line:84%
the Egyptians threw
them out of the country.

00:36:23.750 --> 00:36:26.470 align:middle line:84%
Because they said, we don't
care about the energies.

00:36:26.470 --> 00:36:28.710 align:middle line:84%
All we care is to
prove that this

00:36:28.710 --> 00:36:33.030 align:middle line:84%
is the result of the pharaohs
of the Fourth Dynasty.

00:36:33.030 --> 00:36:34.134 align:middle line:90%
So it is really a shame.

00:36:34.134 --> 00:36:35.550 align:middle line:84%
I mean, if you're
a scientist, you

00:36:35.550 --> 00:36:37.140 align:middle line:90%
need to look for the answers.

00:36:37.140 --> 00:36:40.600 align:middle line:84%
So if you're finding things
like this, like these anomalies,

00:36:40.600 --> 00:36:41.675 align:middle line:90%
you need to work on them.

00:36:41.675 --> 00:36:44.050 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: So let's talk about
the anomalies underground,

00:36:44.050 --> 00:36:46.832 align:middle line:84%
because they don't just stop
at what's coming out the top.

00:36:46.832 --> 00:36:48.040 align:middle line:90%
>> OSMANAGICH: You are right.

00:36:48.040 --> 00:36:49.040 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: When you
go into the tunnels--

00:36:49.040 --> 00:36:49.831 align:middle line:90%
>> OSMANAGICH: Yes.

00:36:49.831 --> 00:36:54.170 align:middle line:84%
If you have the largest
structures above the ground,

00:36:54.170 --> 00:36:55.660 align:middle line:84%
of course they
had to be followed

00:36:55.660 --> 00:36:58.090 align:middle line:84%
with the huge structure
below the ground.

00:36:58.090 --> 00:37:01.140 align:middle line:84%
In 2005, when I first came
to this town of Visoko,

00:37:01.140 --> 00:37:03.680 align:middle line:84%
I wrote in my first
book that we were

00:37:03.680 --> 00:37:08.360 align:middle line:84%
going to find the
underground tunnels.

00:37:08.360 --> 00:37:10.710 align:middle line:84%
And the whole cultural
establishment attacked me.

00:37:10.710 --> 00:37:12.270 align:middle line:90%
They said, what tunnels?

00:37:12.270 --> 00:37:12.860 align:middle line:90%
What chambers?

00:37:12.860 --> 00:37:14.110 align:middle line:90%
What is he talking about?

00:37:14.110 --> 00:37:17.425 align:middle line:84%
Well, seven years later,
turns out that we were right.

00:37:17.425 --> 00:37:23.530 align:middle line:84%
Even though we uncovered
about 850 to 900 meters so far

00:37:23.530 --> 00:37:28.110 align:middle line:84%
in the last six years, it
is probably just 2% or 3%

00:37:28.110 --> 00:37:29.265 align:middle line:90%
of the whole network.

00:37:29.265 --> 00:37:33.510 align:middle line:84%
But then imagine 900 meters
of pre-historical underground

00:37:33.510 --> 00:37:36.330 align:middle line:84%
tunnels are discovered in
the last six, seven years.

00:37:36.330 --> 00:37:40.370 align:middle line:84%
When they discovered
15 meters in Mexico

00:37:40.370 --> 00:37:42.460 align:middle line:84%
in Teotihuacan a
couple of years back,

00:37:42.460 --> 00:37:43.800 align:middle line:90%
that was the world sensation.

00:37:43.800 --> 00:37:46.250 align:middle line:84%
And we've got 900
meters, and we've

00:37:46.250 --> 00:37:48.760 align:middle line:84%
got months and months
in front of us.

00:37:48.760 --> 00:37:52.490 align:middle line:84%
So under the ground,
approximately 25 meters,

00:37:52.490 --> 00:37:53.710 align:middle line:90%
or about 80 feet.

00:37:53.710 --> 00:37:56.610 align:middle line:84%
So below the surface there
is this huge network.

00:37:56.610 --> 00:38:00.500 align:middle line:84%
It consists of tunnels,
chambers, intersections.

00:38:00.500 --> 00:38:04.176 align:middle line:84%
And we can see the traces
of two civilizations--

00:38:04.176 --> 00:38:07.455 align:middle line:84%
A lot of carvings
here, as you can see.

00:38:07.455 --> 00:38:11.040 align:middle line:84%
Looks like a face with
the eyes and the mouth.

00:38:11.040 --> 00:38:14.910 align:middle line:84%
--one who built this
network, and the second one

00:38:14.910 --> 00:38:17.500 align:middle line:84%
who came and for
some reason closed

00:38:17.500 --> 00:38:21.850 align:middle line:84%
all these tunnels, filled
them in, made those dry walls.

00:38:21.850 --> 00:38:23.550 align:middle line:90%
They sealed them.

00:38:23.550 --> 00:38:24.230 align:middle line:90%
Why?

00:38:24.230 --> 00:38:25.690 align:middle line:90%
It's hard to say at this point.

00:38:25.690 --> 00:38:26.270 align:middle line:90%
Look at here.

00:38:26.270 --> 00:38:28.455 align:middle line:84%
Here, obviously
we have the wall.

00:38:28.455 --> 00:38:30.720 align:middle line:90%
Now, we call this wall dry wall.

00:38:30.720 --> 00:38:34.300 align:middle line:84%
Dry wall, it does not have
cement or binding material.

00:38:34.300 --> 00:38:37.236 align:middle line:90%
But they are still very compact.

00:38:37.236 --> 00:38:42.470 align:middle line:84%
Now, behind the dry wall
we have free material.

00:38:42.470 --> 00:38:44.930 align:middle line:90%
And we have a tunnel here.

00:38:44.930 --> 00:38:45.800 align:middle line:90%
You see?

00:38:45.800 --> 00:38:46.931 align:middle line:90%
>>CREW: Yep.

00:38:46.931 --> 00:38:48.920 align:middle line:84%
>> OSMANAGICH: Half-circle
radius-- I mean,

00:38:48.920 --> 00:38:50.710 align:middle line:90%
half-circle ceiling here.

00:38:50.710 --> 00:38:54.650 align:middle line:84%
So somebody completely filled
in this tunnel with material.

00:38:54.650 --> 00:38:57.310 align:middle line:84%
It's not like a couple or
three feet and it's open.

00:38:57.310 --> 00:39:01.701 align:middle line:84%
No, they are completely filled
in for hundreds and hundreds

00:39:01.701 --> 00:39:02.200 align:middle line:90%
of meters.

00:39:02.200 --> 00:39:04.300 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: So what
are we talking about,

00:39:04.300 --> 00:39:06.370 align:middle line:90%
about sheer amounts of material?

00:39:06.370 --> 00:39:10.770 align:middle line:84%
>> OSMANAGICH: We are talking
about tens of miles of tunnels

00:39:10.770 --> 00:39:16.706 align:middle line:84%
and chambers, hundreds of
thousands of tons of material.

00:39:16.706 --> 00:39:19.520 align:middle line:84%
So whoever was
closing this, they

00:39:19.520 --> 00:39:23.100 align:middle line:84%
were able to manipulate with
the hundreds of thousands

00:39:23.100 --> 00:39:26.990 align:middle line:84%
of tons of materials
and millions of rocks,

00:39:26.990 --> 00:39:31.250 align:middle line:84%
probably from the river bed,
and placing them together.

00:39:31.250 --> 00:39:35.630 align:middle line:84%
We can see that somebody had
such brilliant engineering

00:39:35.630 --> 00:39:40.060 align:middle line:84%
skills to build a network that
even today, probably 12,000

00:39:40.060 --> 00:39:44.100 align:middle line:84%
years plus after it was built,
the tunnels are still there.

00:39:44.100 --> 00:39:45.760 align:middle line:90%
They have not collapsed.

00:39:45.760 --> 00:39:51.820 align:middle line:84%
Last month, August of 2012, we
had several earthquakes nearby.

00:39:51.820 --> 00:39:54.315 align:middle line:84%
And during one of them,
I was in the tunnels.

00:39:54.315 --> 00:39:55.680 align:middle line:90%
We could not feel anything.

00:39:55.680 --> 00:39:58.584 align:middle line:84%
We got on the surface, people
are asking us, did you feel it?

00:39:58.584 --> 00:39:59.250 align:middle line:90%
Did you feel it?

00:39:59.250 --> 00:39:59.830 align:middle line:90%
I said, what?

00:39:59.830 --> 00:40:00.360 align:middle line:90%
Earthquake.

00:40:00.360 --> 00:40:01.240 align:middle line:90%
No.

00:40:01.240 --> 00:40:03.580 align:middle line:84%
So after so many
thousands of years,

00:40:03.580 --> 00:40:04.960 align:middle line:90%
it's like earthquake proof.

00:40:04.960 --> 00:40:06.043 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: They're stable.

00:40:06.043 --> 00:40:09.420 align:middle line:84%
Now, all of these
massive tunnels

00:40:09.420 --> 00:40:13.564 align:middle line:84%
were filled in with
that same loose granite.

00:40:13.564 --> 00:40:14.355 align:middle line:90%
>> OSMANAGICH: Yes.

00:40:14.355 --> 00:40:17.710 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: Which looks different
than the surrounding surface

00:40:17.710 --> 00:40:18.530 align:middle line:90%
of the tunnel.

00:40:18.530 --> 00:40:19.880 align:middle line:90%
It's crumbly.

00:40:19.880 --> 00:40:20.940 align:middle line:90%
It's almost like sand.

00:40:20.940 --> 00:40:23.190 align:middle line:84%
>> OSMANAGICH: Yeah, it's
like normal clay and compact

00:40:23.190 --> 00:40:23.689 align:middle line:90%
material.

00:40:23.689 --> 00:40:25.590 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: Yeah, like
very gritty sand.

00:40:25.590 --> 00:40:27.912 align:middle line:90%
But it's completely filled in.

00:40:27.912 --> 00:40:29.370 align:middle line:84%
>> OSMANAGICH: To
the ceiling, yes.

00:40:29.370 --> 00:40:30.453 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: To the ceiling.

00:40:30.453 --> 00:40:32.000 align:middle line:84%
I'm trying to imagine
with a shovel,

00:40:32.000 --> 00:40:35.394 align:middle line:84%
getting it so you have
absolutely no air pockets even.

00:40:35.394 --> 00:40:37.060 align:middle line:84%
>> OSMANAGICH: That
would be impossible.

00:40:37.060 --> 00:40:38.050 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Impossible, yeah.

00:40:38.050 --> 00:40:39.890 align:middle line:84%
>> OSMANAGICH: First
civilization, very advanced.

00:40:39.890 --> 00:40:41.473 align:middle line:84%
The second one-- if
it's a second one.

00:40:41.473 --> 00:40:43.850 align:middle line:84%
Maybe it was the same
one, but thousands

00:40:43.850 --> 00:40:47.030 align:middle line:84%
of years after, also
extremely developed.

00:40:47.030 --> 00:40:50.080 align:middle line:84%
They were able to manipulate
with hundreds of thousands

00:40:50.080 --> 00:40:52.470 align:middle line:90%
of tons of fill-in material.

00:40:52.470 --> 00:40:53.860 align:middle line:90%
How did they move it?

00:40:53.860 --> 00:40:56.990 align:middle line:84%
Obviously it was not
neolithic cave men.

00:40:56.990 --> 00:40:57.900 align:middle line:90%
How they move it?

00:40:57.900 --> 00:41:00.830 align:middle line:84%
How they fill it in all
the way to the ceiling?

00:41:00.830 --> 00:41:04.857 align:middle line:84%
I mean, it was not just
laborers and shovels.

00:41:04.857 --> 00:41:05.440 align:middle line:90%
Of course not.

00:41:05.440 --> 00:41:06.400 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: No, it
wouldn't be possible.

00:41:06.400 --> 00:41:08.649 align:middle line:84%
>> OSMANAGICH: You have to
have something either under

00:41:08.649 --> 00:41:11.250 align:middle line:84%
pressure, like big pipes, and
you fill it up all the way,

00:41:11.250 --> 00:41:14.380 align:middle line:84%
and then you build the
walls every few meters,

00:41:14.380 --> 00:41:17.410 align:middle line:84%
and that's how they would
complete the sections.

00:41:17.410 --> 00:41:19.490 align:middle line:90%
Or they had some other ways.

00:41:19.490 --> 00:41:23.110 align:middle line:84%
Maybe all this material
was levitating somehow,

00:41:23.110 --> 00:41:25.780 align:middle line:84%
and it was filling
all these pockets.

00:41:25.780 --> 00:41:29.160 align:middle line:84%
So we have two big mysteries,
and not a single word

00:41:29.160 --> 00:41:32.020 align:middle line:84%
about those civilizations
in our history books.

00:41:32.020 --> 00:41:34.050 align:middle line:84%
So when you come up
with something new,

00:41:34.050 --> 00:41:37.790 align:middle line:84%
the first reaction of
the mainstream science

00:41:37.790 --> 00:41:40.600 align:middle line:84%
is to attack you, to
try to shut you down

00:41:40.600 --> 00:41:42.939 align:middle line:84%
because they want to
keep the status quo.

00:41:42.939 --> 00:41:43.730 align:middle line:90%
And that's a shame.

00:41:43.730 --> 00:41:44.938 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Well, that's true.

00:41:44.938 --> 00:41:48.640 align:middle line:84%
But what you've been able
to get through analysis

00:41:48.640 --> 00:41:51.280 align:middle line:84%
is that it appears
those tunnels may

00:41:51.280 --> 00:41:54.039 align:middle line:84%
have been filled in
about 5,000 years ago.

00:41:54.039 --> 00:41:54.830 align:middle line:90%
>> OSMANAGICH: Yes.

00:41:54.830 --> 00:41:57.730 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: Which is essentially
the same time period that

00:41:57.730 --> 00:42:00.071 align:middle line:84%
the Egyptologists
say Giza was built.

00:42:00.071 --> 00:42:01.570 align:middle line:84%
Of course, they're
not sure on that.

00:42:01.570 --> 00:42:03.292 align:middle line:84%
I mean, there's
a lot of dispute.

00:42:03.292 --> 00:42:04.500 align:middle line:90%
>> OSMANAGICH: You are right.

00:42:04.500 --> 00:42:06.880 align:middle line:84%
In that fill-in material,
because since they

00:42:06.880 --> 00:42:09.900 align:middle line:84%
had to move hundreds of
thousands of tons of materials,

00:42:09.900 --> 00:42:12.320 align:middle line:84%
we are finding pieces
of organic material,

00:42:12.320 --> 00:42:14.450 align:middle line:84%
pieces of wood and
things like that.

00:42:14.450 --> 00:42:19.210 align:middle line:84%
When we analyze, we
go back 4,610 years.

00:42:19.210 --> 00:42:21.460 align:middle line:90%
So it is almost 5,000 years.

00:42:21.460 --> 00:42:26.140 align:middle line:84%
So it tells us that it was
not a primitive neolithic man

00:42:26.140 --> 00:42:28.070 align:middle line:84%
living in this
area, but there was

00:42:28.070 --> 00:42:30.800 align:middle line:90%
a civilization very advanced.

00:42:30.800 --> 00:42:33.120 align:middle line:84%
Now, being in tunnels--
you were there-- you

00:42:33.120 --> 00:42:36.535 align:middle line:84%
could feel how perfect
is the air circulation.

00:42:36.535 --> 00:42:37.660 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Oh, the tunnels.

00:42:37.660 --> 00:42:39.390 align:middle line:84%
You just want to stay
in there and breathe.

00:42:39.390 --> 00:42:41.264 align:middle line:84%
>> OSMANAGICH: Matter
of fact, you go deeper,

00:42:41.264 --> 00:42:42.455 align:middle line:90%
you breathe better.

00:42:42.455 --> 00:42:44.850 align:middle line:84%
When we have our coal mining
engineers coming through

00:42:44.850 --> 00:42:48.320 align:middle line:84%
the tunnels, they cannot believe
what they experience there.

00:42:48.320 --> 00:42:51.865 align:middle line:84%
They're saying, well, in our
case, when we go 50 meters,

00:42:51.865 --> 00:42:53.690 align:middle line:90%
we lack oxygen.

00:42:53.690 --> 00:42:56.530 align:middle line:84%
We need to use the fans,
get the oxygen inside,

00:42:56.530 --> 00:42:57.740 align:middle line:90%
get the bottles, and so on.

00:42:57.740 --> 00:43:02.010 align:middle line:84%
But in our case, you go deeper,
you breathe better and better.

00:43:02.010 --> 00:43:03.860 align:middle line:90%
And only one entrance.

00:43:03.860 --> 00:43:07.370 align:middle line:84%
So it's the genius of
these ancient builders.

00:43:07.370 --> 00:43:10.240 align:middle line:84%
What they were doing in
order to move the air,

00:43:10.240 --> 00:43:13.350 align:middle line:84%
they were making the
ceilings different heights.

00:43:13.350 --> 00:43:16.980 align:middle line:84%
So some sections sits rather
low, three, four feet.

00:43:16.980 --> 00:43:20.190 align:middle line:84%
Some sections go up
to 10, 12, 15 feet,

00:43:20.190 --> 00:43:21.700 align:middle line:84%
then it comes down
and up and down.

00:43:21.700 --> 00:43:23.440 align:middle line:90%
It's like a sinusoid.

00:43:23.440 --> 00:43:25.570 align:middle line:84%
So when you have
a lower section,

00:43:25.570 --> 00:43:27.500 align:middle line:90%
the air pressure is stronger.

00:43:27.500 --> 00:43:31.600 align:middle line:84%
When you have higher sections,
the air pressure is weaker.

00:43:31.600 --> 00:43:35.480 align:middle line:84%
Strong, weak, strong, weak,
different air pressure, the air

00:43:35.480 --> 00:43:36.600 align:middle line:90%
moves.

00:43:36.600 --> 00:43:40.420 align:middle line:84%
When you have one long tunnel,
it's like you have one big fan.

00:43:40.420 --> 00:43:43.130 align:middle line:84%
When you have hundreds
of tunnels like we do,

00:43:43.130 --> 00:43:45.030 align:middle line:90%
you have hundreds of fans.

00:43:45.030 --> 00:43:48.125 align:middle line:84%
So no need for
electricity or fans.

00:43:48.125 --> 00:43:48.625 align:middle line:90%
Genius.

00:43:48.625 --> 00:43:49.820 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Yeah, genius.

00:43:49.820 --> 00:43:51.530 align:middle line:84%
And it just feels
sublime in there.

00:43:51.530 --> 00:43:52.530 align:middle line:90%
You just want to stay.

00:43:52.530 --> 00:43:56.440 align:middle line:90%


00:43:56.440 --> 00:44:00.100 align:middle line:84%
This is really just
beautiful energy.

00:44:00.100 --> 00:44:01.590 align:middle line:84%
>> OSMANAGICH:
People gets inside,

00:44:01.590 --> 00:44:04.825 align:middle line:84%
they don't think about
the worries of daily life.

00:44:04.825 --> 00:44:08.170 align:middle line:84%
But inside, they think about
this, they got relaxed.

00:44:08.170 --> 00:44:13.500 align:middle line:84%
And in 2010, '11, and '12,
we've had so many testimonies,

00:44:13.500 --> 00:44:16.180 align:middle line:84%
people telling us that
they feel so good.

00:44:16.180 --> 00:44:19.720 align:middle line:84%
If they had asthma,
once they got out,

00:44:19.720 --> 00:44:22.050 align:middle line:84%
asthma, basically they
can breathe normally

00:44:22.050 --> 00:44:23.700 align:middle line:90%
without those little pumps.

00:44:23.700 --> 00:44:25.560 align:middle line:84%
People who have
headaches or back pains,

00:44:25.560 --> 00:44:27.500 align:middle line:90%
those pains are gone.

00:44:27.500 --> 00:44:29.650 align:middle line:84%
Allergies, the
allergies are gone.

00:44:29.650 --> 00:44:31.790 align:middle line:84%
So something strange
was happening there.

00:44:31.790 --> 00:44:33.960 align:middle line:84%
So we wanted to find
a scientific way

00:44:33.960 --> 00:44:38.470 align:middle line:84%
to prove why we have the healing
properties of the tunnels.

00:44:38.470 --> 00:44:42.360 align:middle line:84%
So what we did, we measured the
concentration of negative ions.

00:44:42.360 --> 00:44:45.330 align:middle line:84%
Negative ions kills
viruses, bacterias.

00:44:45.330 --> 00:44:47.900 align:middle line:84%
In our cities, in our
offices, the concentration

00:44:47.900 --> 00:44:51.350 align:middle line:84%
of negative ions is rather
low, 200 negative ions

00:44:51.350 --> 00:44:53.280 align:middle line:90%
per cubic centimeter.

00:44:53.280 --> 00:44:56.950 align:middle line:84%
At the entrance of the
tunnel, 1,000 negative ions.

00:44:56.950 --> 00:44:58.730 align:middle line:84%
In the first
underground chamber,

00:44:58.730 --> 00:45:02.050 align:middle line:84%
approximately 700 feet
from the entrance,

00:45:02.050 --> 00:45:06.774 align:middle line:84%
it is 43,000 negative
ions per cubic centimeter.

00:45:06.774 --> 00:45:08.690 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: No wonder we
felt so good in there.

00:45:08.690 --> 00:45:12.803 align:middle line:84%
>> OSMANAGICH: It's 200 times
healthier than what we have

00:45:12.803 --> 00:45:13.880 align:middle line:90%
here.

00:45:13.880 --> 00:45:16.590 align:middle line:84%
And the second thing,
also very important.

00:45:16.590 --> 00:45:18.110 align:middle line:84%
When we live on
the surface, we are

00:45:18.110 --> 00:45:20.230 align:middle line:90%
exposed to the cosmic radiation.

00:45:20.230 --> 00:45:22.820 align:middle line:84%
Some of them, they are
very bad for our body,

00:45:22.820 --> 00:45:25.930 align:middle line:84%
and our body cells
fight those radiations.

00:45:25.930 --> 00:45:29.130 align:middle line:84%
There are Hartmann grids,
Curry grids, Schneider grids.

00:45:29.130 --> 00:45:30.990 align:middle line:84%
There's underground
natural radioactivity,

00:45:30.990 --> 00:45:34.000 align:middle line:84%
underground water that
releases negative energy.

00:45:34.000 --> 00:45:37.540 align:middle line:84%
So in our life, it's
so many negativity.

00:45:37.540 --> 00:45:41.290 align:middle line:84%
And our body cells, they keep
fighting with those enemies.

00:45:41.290 --> 00:45:44.700 align:middle line:84%
We've measured those values
in the underground labyrinth

00:45:44.700 --> 00:45:46.240 align:middle line:90%
in Visoko.

00:45:46.240 --> 00:45:48.140 align:middle line:90%
No negative cosmic radiations.

00:45:48.140 --> 00:45:51.330 align:middle line:84%
Hartmann and other
grids equal zero.

00:45:51.330 --> 00:45:53.060 align:middle line:90%
No natural radioactivity.

00:45:53.060 --> 00:45:55.830 align:middle line:84%
No negative energy from
the underground waters.

00:45:55.830 --> 00:45:58.520 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: Now, isn't there
normally radiation coming from

00:45:58.520 --> 00:45:59.069 align:middle line:90%
the earth?

00:45:59.069 --> 00:45:59.860 align:middle line:90%
>> OSMANAGICH: Yes.

00:45:59.860 --> 00:46:05.350 align:middle line:84%
But in our case, the
radiations are 10 times lower

00:46:05.350 --> 00:46:07.460 align:middle line:90%
than the minimum allowed.

00:46:07.460 --> 00:46:11.340 align:middle line:84%
So the location of this
place was very important.

00:46:11.340 --> 00:46:16.200 align:middle line:84%
And the way they built it, they
built the safest, most secure

00:46:16.200 --> 00:46:17.720 align:middle line:90%
place on this planet.

00:46:17.720 --> 00:46:19.020 align:middle line:90%
So what's happening now?

00:46:19.020 --> 00:46:22.170 align:middle line:84%
Our body cells don't have
the enemies around them,

00:46:22.170 --> 00:46:24.360 align:middle line:90%
so they start doing their job.

00:46:24.360 --> 00:46:27.087 align:middle line:84%
And their job is to fix
the problems in our bodies.

00:46:27.087 --> 00:46:28.920 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: Maybe that's
why all the people--

00:46:28.920 --> 00:46:31.050 align:middle line:84%
I've seen quite a few
of the people that come

00:46:31.050 --> 00:46:34.530 align:middle line:84%
in as volunteers, and they go
in with a hard hat, a shovel,

00:46:34.530 --> 00:46:35.440 align:middle line:90%
and wheelbarrows.

00:46:35.440 --> 00:46:37.680 align:middle line:84%
This is old-fashioned
excavation.

00:46:37.680 --> 00:46:40.509 align:middle line:84%
But all of them look
very radiant and healthy.

00:46:40.509 --> 00:46:41.300 align:middle line:90%
>> OSMANAGICH: Yes.

00:46:41.300 --> 00:46:43.880 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: And part of it is
they're doing what they love.

00:46:43.880 --> 00:46:46.450 align:middle line:84%
But I couldn't help,
after feeling that energy,

00:46:46.450 --> 00:46:49.830 align:middle line:84%
wondering if that might be
some of what's going on.

00:46:49.830 --> 00:46:53.190 align:middle line:84%
And yet when I'm
thinking, my mind

00:46:53.190 --> 00:46:55.850 align:middle line:84%
keeps going back
to this one place.

00:46:55.850 --> 00:46:59.655 align:middle line:84%
You're talking about a
structure that's been filled in.

00:46:59.655 --> 00:47:03.520 align:middle line:84%
What must the energy have been
like and the energy emission

00:47:03.520 --> 00:47:08.320 align:middle line:84%
been like before the
tunnels were filled in?

00:47:08.320 --> 00:47:10.860 align:middle line:84%
>> OSMANAGICH: Some of the
dowsers who come to the place,

00:47:10.860 --> 00:47:13.745 align:middle line:84%
they come with their dowsing
equipment, wires, and so on.

00:47:13.745 --> 00:47:16.120 align:middle line:84%
When they walk through the
tunnels, they're saying, well,

00:47:16.120 --> 00:47:19.660 align:middle line:84%
this tunnel is built exactly
above the energy lines, the ley

00:47:19.660 --> 00:47:20.570 align:middle line:90%
lines.

00:47:20.570 --> 00:47:22.420 align:middle line:84%
So we always have
energy involved.

00:47:22.420 --> 00:47:25.210 align:middle line:84%
So imagine tens of
miles of the tunnels.

00:47:25.210 --> 00:47:27.920 align:middle line:84%
You have energy
flows everywhere.

00:47:27.920 --> 00:47:30.346 align:middle line:84%
And most of it are
flowing to the pyramid.

00:47:30.346 --> 00:47:31.970 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: Through
that spiral network.

00:47:31.970 --> 00:47:33.136 align:middle line:90%
>> OSMANAGICH: Yes, exactly.

00:47:33.136 --> 00:47:35.260 align:middle line:84%
And that's why we have
this focused energy going

00:47:35.260 --> 00:47:37.350 align:middle line:90%
through top of the pyramid.

00:47:37.350 --> 00:47:39.500 align:middle line:84%
But once we get
back to the tunnels,

00:47:39.500 --> 00:47:42.710 align:middle line:84%
obviously, one of the
purposes, maybe main purpose,

00:47:42.710 --> 00:47:46.420 align:middle line:84%
is to get enough energy for the
main generator for the pyramid.

00:47:46.420 --> 00:47:51.430 align:middle line:84%
But also among some other,
maybe secondary, is the health.

00:47:51.430 --> 00:47:55.240 align:middle line:84%
Basically the main
thing in our life

00:47:55.240 --> 00:47:57.990 align:middle line:84%
is living healthy
with a prolonged life.

00:47:57.990 --> 00:48:00.970 align:middle line:84%
And they made this
underground facility

00:48:00.970 --> 00:48:04.790 align:middle line:84%
to say what is the
most valuable to us.

00:48:04.790 --> 00:48:05.820 align:middle line:90%
That's the second thing.

00:48:05.820 --> 00:48:07.250 align:middle line:90%
Probably there are more.

00:48:07.250 --> 00:48:09.920 align:middle line:84%
So it seems whenever they
were building something,

00:48:09.920 --> 00:48:12.200 align:middle line:90%
it did have several functions.

00:48:12.200 --> 00:48:13.950 align:middle line:84%
Now, with this
energy beam coming

00:48:13.950 --> 00:48:16.090 align:middle line:84%
through top of the
pyramid, if you

00:48:16.090 --> 00:48:18.740 align:middle line:84%
could reach any other
planet, obviously you

00:48:18.740 --> 00:48:20.740 align:middle line:90%
have a communication mean.

00:48:20.740 --> 00:48:23.370 align:middle line:84%
Because with energy bridge
between two planets,

00:48:23.370 --> 00:48:28.620 align:middle line:84%
you can move the vibrations,
information, and so on.

00:48:28.620 --> 00:48:31.340 align:middle line:84%
And then the second
thing, what are we?

00:48:31.340 --> 00:48:32.740 align:middle line:90%
We are just the vibrations.

00:48:32.740 --> 00:48:36.140 align:middle line:84%
We simply vibrate differently
than this table or this planet.

00:48:36.140 --> 00:48:38.780 align:middle line:84%
So there is a way,
technically speaking,

00:48:38.780 --> 00:48:42.170 align:middle line:90%
to move objects or our bodies.

00:48:42.170 --> 00:48:45.750 align:middle line:84%
So you have a base
for the teleportation.

00:48:45.750 --> 00:48:49.050 align:middle line:84%
The third thing, nowadays
when in China or Russia

00:48:49.050 --> 00:48:51.630 align:middle line:84%
you have stormy weather,
they have these projectiles.

00:48:51.630 --> 00:48:54.050 align:middle line:84%
They disperse those
stormy clouds.

00:48:54.050 --> 00:48:57.690 align:middle line:84%
There is a way to
focus this energy beam

00:48:57.690 --> 00:48:58.899 align:middle line:90%
and then adjust the climate.

00:48:58.899 --> 00:49:00.940 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: Well, just like
the Orgone generators.

00:49:00.940 --> 00:49:02.148 align:middle line:90%
>> OSMANAGICH: Exactly right.

00:49:02.148 --> 00:49:04.790 align:middle line:84%
Then you can use it for
heating, for healing,

00:49:04.790 --> 00:49:06.460 align:middle line:90%
for military purposes.

00:49:06.460 --> 00:49:09.570 align:middle line:84%
I mean, our imagination
is our limit.

00:49:09.570 --> 00:49:13.420 align:middle line:84%
When you have enough energy,
then you can find a use for it.

00:49:13.420 --> 00:49:15.350 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: OK, now
we get to, to me,

00:49:15.350 --> 00:49:18.240 align:middle line:84%
just the astounding
part of this.

00:49:18.240 --> 00:49:22.340 align:middle line:84%
You had more analysis
done on organic material.

00:49:22.340 --> 00:49:24.430 align:middle line:84%
And I believe you
said it was trapped

00:49:24.430 --> 00:49:27.510 align:middle line:84%
between the outer surface
blocks of the pyramid

00:49:27.510 --> 00:49:30.880 align:middle line:84%
and the sand and
everything that's

00:49:30.880 --> 00:49:33.690 align:middle line:84%
come over time to
revegetate the area.

00:49:33.690 --> 00:49:36.940 align:middle line:84%
And you had that analyzed
because that would tell you

00:49:36.940 --> 00:49:37.752 align:middle line:90%
a lot, right?

00:49:37.752 --> 00:49:38.710 align:middle line:90%
>> OSMANAGICH: Exactly.

00:49:38.710 --> 00:49:42.870 align:middle line:84%
Well, in June of 2012, we had
our first shift of volunteers.

00:49:42.870 --> 00:49:47.630 align:middle line:84%
And we asked them to extend one
of our archaeological trenches.

00:49:47.630 --> 00:49:48.980 align:middle line:90%
We saw the concrete blocks.

00:49:48.980 --> 00:49:52.080 align:middle line:84%
We said, OK, let's go five,
six feet to the right.

00:49:52.080 --> 00:49:54.210 align:middle line:84%
So basically they were
removing approximately three

00:49:54.210 --> 00:49:58.670 align:middle line:84%
and a half feet of the soil
and the clay and the dirt.

00:49:58.670 --> 00:50:02.140 align:middle line:84%
And once they removed
that, we discovered

00:50:02.140 --> 00:50:06.530 align:middle line:84%
on the surface of concrete
blocks an organic material,

00:50:06.530 --> 00:50:09.880 align:middle line:84%
fossilized organic
material, pieces of wood.

00:50:09.880 --> 00:50:12.680 align:middle line:84%
And incidentally we had an
Austrian, Terry Kreuger.

00:50:12.680 --> 00:50:15.240 align:middle line:84%
I was there, a couple
of our archaeologists.

00:50:15.240 --> 00:50:18.520 align:middle line:84%
And we saw that piece of organic
material, we were so exciting.

00:50:18.520 --> 00:50:20.770 align:middle line:84%
We said hey, this
organic material

00:50:20.770 --> 00:50:23.890 align:middle line:84%
can give us a minimum
age of the pyramid.

00:50:23.890 --> 00:50:27.390 align:middle line:84%
So obviously it was before
this dirt starting, you know,

00:50:27.390 --> 00:50:30.370 align:middle line:84%
accumulating and after
the pyramid was built,

00:50:30.370 --> 00:50:32.680 align:middle line:84%
after the concrete
blocks were there.

00:50:32.680 --> 00:50:38.260 align:middle line:84%
So we sent the samples
to two lab in Europe.

00:50:38.260 --> 00:50:40.080 align:middle line:90%
One is in Poland in Gliwice.

00:50:40.080 --> 00:50:42.120 align:middle line:84%
The other one is
Kiev in Ukraine.

00:50:42.120 --> 00:50:45.010 align:middle line:84%
And we already received
the first results back

00:50:45.010 --> 00:50:46.100 align:middle line:90%
from Ukraine.

00:50:46.100 --> 00:50:50.740 align:middle line:84%
And exclusively for you guys,
I can give you the results.

00:50:50.740 --> 00:50:58.070 align:middle line:84%
The results is 24,800
years, plus/minus 200 years.

00:50:58.070 --> 00:51:01.910 align:middle line:84%
So we are going
back 25,000 years.

00:51:01.910 --> 00:51:05.620 align:middle line:84%
So this is the minimum age of
the Bosnian Pyramid of the Sun.

00:51:05.620 --> 00:51:06.870 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: This is astounding.

00:51:06.870 --> 00:51:10.110 align:middle line:84%
>> OSMANAGICH: It forever
changes our view of the ancient

00:51:10.110 --> 00:51:12.660 align:middle line:90%
history.

00:51:12.660 --> 00:51:14.270 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Does it ever.

00:51:14.270 --> 00:51:16.900 align:middle line:84%
I mean, when you got
this information back,

00:51:16.900 --> 00:51:18.970 align:middle line:90%
were you expecting this?

00:51:18.970 --> 00:51:21.350 align:middle line:84%
>> OSMANAGICH: Well, we knew
that it would be more than

00:51:21.350 --> 00:51:24.860 align:middle line:84%
12,000 years, more than the
end of the last ice age.

00:51:24.860 --> 00:51:27.010 align:middle line:84%
Because from the
very beginning, these

00:51:27.010 --> 00:51:28.590 align:middle line:84%
were the type of
information we were

00:51:28.590 --> 00:51:30.910 align:middle line:90%
getting from different sources.

00:51:30.910 --> 00:51:34.500 align:middle line:84%
For example, if you can figure
out the age of the soil,

00:51:34.500 --> 00:51:37.080 align:middle line:84%
then you can say the
minimum age of the pyramid.

00:51:37.080 --> 00:51:40.460 align:middle line:84%
And the science that deals
with the soil and its origin

00:51:40.460 --> 00:51:41.720 align:middle line:90%
is called pedology.

00:51:41.720 --> 00:51:45.220 align:middle line:84%
We had institutes for pedology
from Bosnia, and they came.

00:51:45.220 --> 00:51:47.910 align:middle line:84%
They measured the samples of
the Sun and the Moon pyramids,

00:51:47.910 --> 00:51:49.950 align:middle line:84%
and they said the
soil is between 12,000

00:51:49.950 --> 00:51:52.040 align:middle line:90%
and 15,000 years.

00:51:52.040 --> 00:51:55.060 align:middle line:84%
So we already knew that
it will be extremely old.

00:51:55.060 --> 00:51:59.090 align:middle line:84%
But once you get such a
hard scientific data showing

00:51:59.090 --> 00:52:02.940 align:middle line:84%
25,000 years, of course
it is mind-blowing.

00:52:02.940 --> 00:52:05.310 align:middle line:84%
And then when you go
and see official results

00:52:05.310 --> 00:52:10.210 align:middle line:84%
for Egyptian pyramids--
4,500 years-- for Mexican,

00:52:10.210 --> 00:52:14.610 align:middle line:84%
Peruvian, Chinese,
2,000 to 3,000,

00:52:14.610 --> 00:52:20.552 align:middle line:84%
you can say, hey, these are the
oldest pyramids on the planet.

00:52:20.552 --> 00:52:23.010 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: And people don't
really have a context for that.

00:52:23.010 --> 00:52:25.160 align:middle line:84%
I mean, if you listen
to certain circles,

00:52:25.160 --> 00:52:26.827 align:middle line:84%
humanity is only 6,000
years old, right?

00:52:26.827 --> 00:52:27.785 align:middle line:90%
>> OSMANAGICH: Exactly.

00:52:27.785 --> 00:52:30.440 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: You go to others who
will say, no, at least 12,000.

00:52:30.440 --> 00:52:32.040 align:middle line:84%
Now, some of the
people are starting

00:52:32.040 --> 00:52:34.730 align:middle line:84%
to extend out to at
least 12,000 now, even

00:52:34.730 --> 00:52:36.650 align:middle line:90%
in the world of science.

00:52:36.650 --> 00:52:42.470 align:middle line:84%
And yet, when we think
academically right now,

00:52:42.470 --> 00:52:44.570 align:middle line:84%
what would they
say would have been

00:52:44.570 --> 00:52:47.484 align:middle line:90%
going on here 25,000 years ago?

00:52:47.484 --> 00:52:49.400 align:middle line:84%
>> OSMANAGICH: Of course
they will be shocked.

00:52:49.400 --> 00:52:51.655 align:middle line:84%
They were shocked when we said
that the pyramids are in Bosnia

00:52:51.655 --> 00:52:53.330 align:middle line:84%
are bigger than
the Egyptian ones.

00:52:53.330 --> 00:52:54.662 align:middle line:90%
But it is shock after shock.

00:52:54.662 --> 00:52:56.120 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: Shock
after shock, yeah.

00:52:56.120 --> 00:52:57.160 align:middle line:90%
>> OSMANAGICH: So what?

00:52:57.160 --> 00:52:59.410 align:middle line:84%
I mean, we have to
stay open minded.

00:52:59.410 --> 00:53:01.900 align:middle line:84%
And then I don't
think that we do

00:53:01.900 --> 00:53:04.940 align:middle line:84%
have a real age for the
oldest Egyptian pyramids

00:53:04.940 --> 00:53:07.885 align:middle line:84%
or Mexican pyramids or
Peruvian or Chinese pyramids.

00:53:07.885 --> 00:53:11.700 align:middle line:84%
You go to China, out of
250 pyramids, 20 of them,

00:53:11.700 --> 00:53:13.460 align:middle line:84%
the biggest ones, are
the most superior,

00:53:13.460 --> 00:53:16.370 align:middle line:84%
built from granite
and limestone,

00:53:16.370 --> 00:53:18.690 align:middle line:84%
and the smallest
from the mud bricks.

00:53:18.690 --> 00:53:22.730 align:middle line:84%
We know that the Chinese
emperors did use the mud brick.

00:53:22.730 --> 00:53:25.910 align:middle line:84%
But we know that they did not
use the granite because they

00:53:25.910 --> 00:53:28.500 align:middle line:84%
did not have tools, so
they are much older.

00:53:28.500 --> 00:53:30.740 align:middle line:84%
1967, the Chinese
archaeologist who

00:53:30.740 --> 00:53:33.220 align:middle line:84%
deciphered some of the
hieroglyphic symbols

00:53:33.220 --> 00:53:36.250 align:middle line:90%
said they are 12,500 years old.

00:53:36.250 --> 00:53:38.500 align:middle line:84%
And then they sent him
to the mental hospital.

00:53:38.500 --> 00:53:40.850 align:middle line:84%
But we know that
there are information

00:53:40.850 --> 00:53:44.560 align:middle line:84%
out there telling us that
some of the older pyramids

00:53:44.560 --> 00:53:47.310 align:middle line:84%
are older than the end
of the last ice age.

00:53:47.310 --> 00:53:48.080 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Yes.

00:53:48.080 --> 00:53:51.550 align:middle line:84%
>> OSMANAGICH: So we are
going back to different cycle

00:53:51.550 --> 00:53:53.670 align:middle line:90%
of civilization on this planet.

00:53:53.670 --> 00:53:56.350 align:middle line:84%
And that's what the elite
don't want us to believe.

00:53:56.350 --> 00:53:59.510 align:middle line:84%
They are telling us everything
started with Sumer and Babylon,

00:53:59.510 --> 00:54:02.080 align:middle line:84%
Akkad, Assyria, ancient
Egypt, ancient India,

00:54:02.080 --> 00:54:04.280 align:middle line:84%
6,000, 7,000 years
ago, and that's it.

00:54:04.280 --> 00:54:05.920 align:middle line:90%
Well, that's not it.

00:54:05.920 --> 00:54:09.470 align:middle line:84%
That's just the last
cycle of humanity.

00:54:09.470 --> 00:54:11.480 align:middle line:84%
Before this one there
was another one,

00:54:11.480 --> 00:54:14.070 align:middle line:84%
which was interrupted by
the global catastrophe.

00:54:14.070 --> 00:54:16.970 align:middle line:84%
Before that one there was
another one, and another one.

00:54:16.970 --> 00:54:21.350 align:middle line:84%
So that's what's happening
on the face of this planet.

00:54:21.350 --> 00:54:23.390 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: I mean, that
does change everything.

00:54:23.390 --> 00:54:27.220 align:middle line:84%
All the books, as you say, once
something like this happens,

00:54:27.220 --> 00:54:28.722 align:middle line:90%
everything has to be rewritten.

00:54:28.722 --> 00:54:29.680 align:middle line:90%
>> OSMANAGICH: Exactly.

00:54:29.680 --> 00:54:32.960 align:middle line:84%
And in science, the
only thing that counts

00:54:32.960 --> 00:54:37.470 align:middle line:84%
are the scientific arguments,
lab analysis, test reports,

00:54:37.470 --> 00:54:38.990 align:middle line:90%
datings.

00:54:38.990 --> 00:54:42.520 align:middle line:84%
And what we have here when
it comes to Bosnian pyramid

00:54:42.520 --> 00:54:44.760 align:middle line:84%
project, a lot of people
saying, oh, it's impossible.

00:54:44.760 --> 00:54:47.450 align:middle line:90%
Oh, I don't believe.

00:54:47.450 --> 00:54:49.160 align:middle line:90%
That's their opinions.

00:54:49.160 --> 00:54:51.532 align:middle line:90%
Opinions are irrelevant.

00:54:51.532 --> 00:54:52.240 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Right.

00:54:52.240 --> 00:54:55.600 align:middle line:84%
But I can't help but think
this has to be major.

00:54:55.600 --> 00:54:56.780 align:middle line:90%
You've just told us.

00:54:56.780 --> 00:54:59.220 align:middle line:84%
We're the first media
that know about this.

00:54:59.220 --> 00:55:01.799 align:middle line:84%
In another few days, you
have a conference happening.

00:55:01.799 --> 00:55:03.340 align:middle line:84%
More media is going
to know about it,

00:55:03.340 --> 00:55:06.820 align:middle line:84%
and this is going to start
trickling out around the world.

00:55:06.820 --> 00:55:08.490 align:middle line:84%
What do you expect
is going to happen

00:55:08.490 --> 00:55:10.624 align:middle line:90%
once that finding is known?

00:55:10.624 --> 00:55:13.040 align:middle line:84%
>> OSMANAGICH: Once people
start getting this information,

00:55:13.040 --> 00:55:15.440 align:middle line:84%
they will start thinking,
hey, obviously it was wrong,

00:55:15.440 --> 00:55:19.160 align:middle line:84%
what they were telling us, so
let's try to find the context.

00:55:19.160 --> 00:55:22.660 align:middle line:84%
And then they will realize that
all these anomalies, Yonaguni

00:55:22.660 --> 00:55:26.000 align:middle line:84%
monuments on the
bottom Pacific floor--

00:55:26.000 --> 00:55:27.630 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: Graham
Hancock's work, yeah.

00:55:27.630 --> 00:55:30.280 align:middle line:84%
>> OSMANAGICH: Lebanon,
huge blocks, 1,200 tons.

00:55:30.280 --> 00:55:33.590 align:middle line:84%
The new dating of Mexican,
Peruvian pyramids,

00:55:33.590 --> 00:55:35.670 align:middle line:84%
now they are getting
a new context

00:55:35.670 --> 00:55:37.730 align:middle line:90%
with the Bosnian pyramids.

00:55:37.730 --> 00:55:39.610 align:middle line:84%
And the nice thing
about it, like you said,

00:55:39.610 --> 00:55:42.590 align:middle line:84%
we are going to end up
with the volunteers.

00:55:42.590 --> 00:55:45.650 align:middle line:84%
Our international summer
camps-- now look at the data.

00:55:45.650 --> 00:55:49.660 align:middle line:84%
2010, 500 volunteers,
30 countries.

00:55:49.660 --> 00:55:52.300 align:middle line:84%
2011, they came
from 32 countries.

00:55:52.300 --> 00:55:57.790 align:middle line:84%
2012, 700 of them, 52
countries and six continents.

00:55:57.790 --> 00:55:59.070 align:middle line:90%
That's what we want to do.

00:55:59.070 --> 00:56:01.145 align:middle line:84%
We want to give the
power to the people,

00:56:01.145 --> 00:56:03.300 align:middle line:90%
the power of information.

00:56:03.300 --> 00:56:07.400 align:middle line:84%
Because when there is a
free flow of information,

00:56:07.400 --> 00:56:10.890 align:middle line:84%
no need for the
elites and the others.

00:56:10.890 --> 00:56:13.580 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: And as for who
built it, why they built it,

00:56:13.580 --> 00:56:17.500 align:middle line:84%
and what's in there, you
believe there's a secret to be

00:56:17.500 --> 00:56:18.690 align:middle line:90%
revealed.

00:56:18.690 --> 00:56:19.750 align:middle line:90%
>> OSMANAGICH: There is.

00:56:19.750 --> 00:56:22.280 align:middle line:84%
Seven years after, we are
just scratching the surface.

00:56:22.280 --> 00:56:25.920 align:middle line:84%
But we do know it was a
more advanced civilization,

00:56:25.920 --> 00:56:29.277 align:middle line:90%
and a lot to learn from them.

00:56:29.277 --> 00:56:31.360 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: Do you feel
that we have matured enough

00:56:31.360 --> 00:56:34.950 align:middle line:84%
as a species that we're ready
to know this technology?

00:56:34.950 --> 00:56:39.220 align:middle line:84%
>> OSMANAGICH: We will need to
develop spiritually in order

00:56:39.220 --> 00:56:42.500 align:middle line:84%
to understand everything, and
then the knowledge will be

00:56:42.500 --> 00:56:44.470 align:middle line:90%
given to us.

00:56:44.470 --> 00:56:48.230 align:middle line:84%
And so much to learn from
this side and some other.

00:56:48.230 --> 00:56:52.250 align:middle line:84%
And then, once we are
ready, we will learn a lot.

00:56:52.250 --> 00:56:54.150 align:middle line:84%
We will move ourself
to the next step.

00:56:54.150 --> 00:56:56.690 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: And I want to see
what the energy is like once

00:56:56.690 --> 00:56:59.030 align:middle line:84%
you get this entire
thing excavated.

00:56:59.030 --> 00:57:01.740 align:middle line:84%
But as you were saying, you
still need a lot of volunteers.

00:57:01.740 --> 00:57:04.660 align:middle line:84%
At this rate, with the number
of people you have right now

00:57:04.660 --> 00:57:07.110 align:middle line:84%
and your number of
wheelbarrows and shovels,

00:57:07.110 --> 00:57:08.890 align:middle line:90%
it would take about 200 years?

00:57:08.890 --> 00:57:10.960 align:middle line:10%
>> OSMANAGICH: 200
years, exactly.

00:57:10.960 --> 00:57:12.970 align:middle line:10%
Unfortunately, a lot
of the time, everything

00:57:12.970 --> 00:57:14.470 align:middle line:10%
boils down to the money.

00:57:14.470 --> 00:57:15.760 align:middle line:10%
We need more money, of course.

00:57:15.760 --> 00:57:17.360 align:middle line:10%
We need more, you know, funding.

00:57:17.360 --> 00:57:19.920 align:middle line:10%
But even with this stage
with the volunteers,

00:57:19.920 --> 00:57:23.100 align:middle line:10%
I'm talking very positively
of what we have here.

00:57:23.100 --> 00:57:25.970 align:middle line:84%
I think more people wil
be coming, more tourists.

00:57:25.970 --> 00:57:29.240 align:middle line:84%
And finally, people who
are ready to finance

00:57:29.240 --> 00:57:33.380 align:middle line:84%
certain commercial projects,
tourist projects, and so

00:57:33.380 --> 00:57:36.440 align:middle line:84%
on, and they should speed up
the whole scientific project.

00:57:36.440 --> 00:57:39.740 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: And the other overlay
to this is there are incredible

00:57:39.740 --> 00:57:42.990 align:middle line:84%
technologies that are being
developed right as we speak

00:57:42.990 --> 00:57:47.380 align:middle line:84%
that are already in existence
that are already able to look

00:57:47.380 --> 00:57:49.710 align:middle line:84%
at it and say, this
is what's there,

00:57:49.710 --> 00:57:52.800 align:middle line:84%
and there are some big surprises
still in the future not just

00:57:52.800 --> 00:57:54.470 align:middle line:90%
here, all over the planet.

00:57:54.470 --> 00:57:57.000 align:middle line:84%
As you say, there are
pyramids everywhere.

00:57:57.000 --> 00:57:59.130 align:middle line:84%
But the fact that you've
gone this far on this one,

00:57:59.130 --> 00:58:01.210 align:middle line:84%
this gives us a place
to really sink our teeth

00:58:01.210 --> 00:58:04.070 align:middle line:84%
into at the scientific
community and the hearts
