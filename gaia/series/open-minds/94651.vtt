>>REGINA MEREDITH:
Though it's not commonly

00:00:06.670 --> 00:00:09.790 align:middle line:84%
perceived this way, one of our
most intimate relationships

00:00:09.790 --> 00:00:11.470 align:middle line:90%
in life is with money.

00:00:11.470 --> 00:00:15.160 align:middle line:84%
Here in the City of London, it's
the tool for global control.

00:00:15.160 --> 00:00:17.910 align:middle line:84%
For most of us, it
affects every single thing

00:00:17.910 --> 00:00:19.510 align:middle line:90%
we do in our daily lives.

00:00:19.510 --> 00:00:22.450 align:middle line:84%
In a moment, we're going to meet
with Tracy Smith, who tells us

00:00:22.450 --> 00:00:26.108 align:middle line:84%
how we can transform our
relationship with money.

00:00:26.108 --> 00:00:29.102 align:middle line:90%
[THEME MUSIC]

00:00:29.102 --> 00:00:50.110 align:middle line:90%


00:00:50.110 --> 00:00:51.960 align:middle line:84%
Thank you for joining
us here, Tracy.

00:00:51.960 --> 00:00:54.500 align:middle line:10%
You say right off
the bat that money

00:00:54.500 --> 00:00:57.049 align:middle line:10%
is one of our most intimate
relationships in life.

00:00:57.049 --> 00:00:58.590 align:middle line:10%
And if you were to
ask people, what's

00:00:58.590 --> 00:01:01.540 align:middle line:10%
your must intimate relationship,
they would never say money.

00:01:01.540 --> 00:01:04.555 align:middle line:84%
But in fact-- please
talk about that.

00:01:04.555 --> 00:01:06.930 align:middle line:10%
>>TRACY SMITH: How you do
money is how you do everything.

00:01:06.930 --> 00:01:10.610 align:middle line:10%
So that's the tenet
that lies at the heart

00:01:10.610 --> 00:01:13.280 align:middle line:10%
of the work, the sacred
money archetype work.

00:01:13.280 --> 00:01:16.260 align:middle line:10%
So sacred money
archetypes were developed

00:01:16.260 --> 00:01:18.840 align:middle line:10%
by Kendall SummerHawk, and
that's one of her sayings,

00:01:18.840 --> 00:01:21.130 align:middle line:10%
that how you do money is
how you do everything.

00:01:21.130 --> 00:01:25.220 align:middle line:10%
And that was certainly the thing
that captured my attention.

00:01:25.220 --> 00:01:29.830 align:middle line:10%
Probably about 2 years ago--
2 and 1/2 years ago now-- so

00:01:29.830 --> 00:01:32.530 align:middle line:10%
I've been running
aCREATIVEspace business there.

00:01:32.530 --> 00:01:35.467 align:middle line:84%
And at aCREATIVEspace,
we always say

00:01:35.467 --> 00:01:37.050 align:middle line:84%
it's about helping
people create lives

00:01:37.050 --> 00:01:39.830 align:middle line:84%
they love-- so do what they
love with people they love,

00:01:39.830 --> 00:01:41.290 align:middle line:90%
in places they love.

00:01:41.290 --> 00:01:44.380 align:middle line:84%
And over and over again,
the main obstacle to that

00:01:44.380 --> 00:01:46.550 align:middle line:90%
seemed to be not-- the money.

00:01:46.550 --> 00:01:49.170 align:middle line:84%
They didn't feel they
could afford to do it,

00:01:49.170 --> 00:01:51.780 align:middle line:84%
wouldn't be able to support
themselves doing it.

00:01:51.780 --> 00:01:54.680 align:middle line:84%
And so about 2
and 1/2 years ago,

00:01:54.680 --> 00:01:57.210 align:middle line:84%
I started to look
for something that

00:01:57.210 --> 00:02:00.600 align:middle line:84%
might help overcome
that problem.

00:02:00.600 --> 00:02:03.420 align:middle line:84%
I was also getting very tired
of people loving the work we did

00:02:03.420 --> 00:02:04.837 align:middle line:84%
but saying I can't
really afford--

00:02:04.837 --> 00:02:05.711 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: To pay you.

00:02:05.711 --> 00:02:07.190 align:middle line:90%
>>SMITH: --pay you, yeah.

00:02:07.190 --> 00:02:10.340 align:middle line:84%
And it also felt like, actually,
energetically-- it's like,

00:02:10.340 --> 00:02:13.300 align:middle line:84%
wouldn't it be great if by
helping somebody energetically,

00:02:13.300 --> 00:02:15.930 align:middle line:84%
it must mean that you start
to help them with the money

00:02:15.930 --> 00:02:17.140 align:middle line:90%
as well.

00:02:17.140 --> 00:02:19.820 align:middle line:84%
So I felt this was a bit of
my repertoire, if you like,

00:02:19.820 --> 00:02:20.870 align:middle line:90%
that was missing.

00:02:20.870 --> 00:02:23.360 align:middle line:84%
And I remember, particularly,
sitting at lunch,

00:02:23.360 --> 00:02:25.219 align:middle line:84%
waiting for my two
daughters to arrive.

00:02:25.219 --> 00:02:26.760 align:middle line:84%
And there was a
women sat next to me,

00:02:26.760 --> 00:02:29.180 align:middle line:84%
and she had a financial
adviser with her,

00:02:29.180 --> 00:02:32.120 align:middle line:84%
who was taking her through
figures and things.

00:02:32.120 --> 00:02:33.790 align:middle line:84%
And I thought,
wouldn't it be great

00:02:33.790 --> 00:02:37.330 align:middle line:84%
if we could actually take
somebody through their money

00:02:37.330 --> 00:02:40.680 align:middle line:84%
and actually go in at that level
to make the other differences,

00:02:40.680 --> 00:02:44.426 align:middle line:84%
rather than-- facing it, sort
of taking it straight on, rather

00:02:44.426 --> 00:02:46.050 align:middle line:84%
than doing all the
other stuff and then

00:02:46.050 --> 00:02:49.800 align:middle line:84%
getting to the I love what
you do, but I can't afford it.

00:02:49.800 --> 00:02:52.280 align:middle line:84%
So I really began
to look into this,

00:02:52.280 --> 00:02:55.010 align:middle line:84%
and I remember finding--
it's one of those things;

00:02:55.010 --> 00:02:57.000 align:middle line:84%
I don't know how I
came across the email,

00:02:57.000 --> 00:03:00.010 align:middle line:84%
but I'm listening to an
introductory call Kendall

00:03:00.010 --> 00:03:02.157 align:middle line:84%
was doing, and she
said those words,

00:03:02.157 --> 00:03:03.990 align:middle line:84%
"how you do money is
how you do everything."

00:03:03.990 --> 00:03:05.510 align:middle line:84%
And that was it,
because I really

00:03:05.510 --> 00:03:09.070 align:middle line:84%
felt that when I looked
at people's relationship

00:03:09.070 --> 00:03:11.590 align:middle line:84%
with money, you could see
what was actually going on

00:03:11.590 --> 00:03:13.350 align:middle line:84%
with them energetically,
because it's

00:03:13.350 --> 00:03:14.860 align:middle line:90%
like the money doesn't lie.

00:03:14.860 --> 00:03:19.030 align:middle line:84%
It's a real-- it really
shows the true picture.

00:03:19.030 --> 00:03:21.770 align:middle line:84%
And in particular, there'd
been a couple who were--

00:03:21.770 --> 00:03:24.580 align:middle line:84%
who I'd-- working with
the wife-- well, ex-wife.

00:03:24.580 --> 00:03:26.950 align:middle line:84%
They'd been divorced
for a number of years.

00:03:26.950 --> 00:03:30.010 align:middle line:84%
But I noticed that,
energetically, there was still

00:03:30.010 --> 00:03:32.970 align:middle line:84%
a massive tie between
her and her ex-husband,

00:03:32.970 --> 00:03:36.000 align:middle line:84%
and he was still
supporting her financially.

00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:40.180 align:middle line:84%
And so regardless of what she
was fronting, energetically,

00:03:40.180 --> 00:03:43.330 align:middle line:84%
there was still this
very complex relationship

00:03:43.330 --> 00:03:45.900 align:middle line:84%
between the two, and
that was something

00:03:45.900 --> 00:03:47.550 align:middle line:84%
that was really,
really interesting.

00:03:47.550 --> 00:03:49.305 align:middle line:84%
So when Kendall
said, "How you do

00:03:49.305 --> 00:03:53.680 align:middle line:84%
money is how you do everything,"
it was like, OK, this is it.

00:03:53.680 --> 00:03:56.700 align:middle line:84%
And I started with her, doing
something called the money

00:03:56.700 --> 00:03:57.930 align:middle line:90%
breakthrough method.

00:03:57.930 --> 00:04:01.900 align:middle line:84%
And there was a key
piece in that for me,

00:04:01.900 --> 00:04:03.580 align:middle line:84%
which was looking
at your family money

00:04:03.580 --> 00:04:06.239 align:middle line:90%
legacy, which was fascinating.

00:04:06.239 --> 00:04:07.780 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Inter--
tell us about that.

00:04:07.780 --> 00:04:10.480 align:middle line:84%
>>SMITH: Yeah,so it was actually
an exercise that was actually

00:04:10.480 --> 00:04:13.380 align:middle line:84%
looking at what your
family money story was,

00:04:13.380 --> 00:04:17.050 align:middle line:84%
because most of us pick up
all our beliefs around money

00:04:17.050 --> 00:04:20.320 align:middle line:84%
by-- probably by the age
of six from our parents,

00:04:20.320 --> 00:04:23.350 align:middle line:84%
and we pick a lot of
those up subconsciously.

00:04:23.350 --> 00:04:27.130 align:middle line:84%
And if you never actually
visit those consciously,

00:04:27.130 --> 00:04:29.400 align:middle line:84%
it's like having a six-year-old
running your money.

00:04:29.400 --> 00:04:30.150 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Oh, boy.

00:04:30.150 --> 00:04:31.490 align:middle line:90%
That's true, isn't it?

00:04:31.490 --> 00:04:33.270 align:middle line:84%
>>SMITH: So it's
actually looking

00:04:33.270 --> 00:04:35.780 align:middle line:84%
at what those beliefs are
because if your beliefs create

00:04:35.780 --> 00:04:37.829 align:middle line:84%
your experience,
then your-- that's

00:04:37.829 --> 00:04:39.995 align:middle line:84%
going to create your
experience of money, with then,

00:04:39.995 --> 00:04:41.991 align:middle line:84%
of course, reinforces
your belief around money.

00:04:41.991 --> 00:04:43.740 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Well, so not
to be too personal,

00:04:43.740 --> 00:04:45.552 align:middle line:90%
but yes, let's be personal.

00:04:45.552 --> 00:04:46.510 align:middle line:90%
>>SMITH: What was mine?

00:04:46.510 --> 00:04:47.240 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: So what was yours?

00:04:47.240 --> 00:04:49.199 align:middle line:84%
What was the six-year-old
running your program?

00:04:49.199 --> 00:04:51.448 align:middle line:84%
>>SMITH: The six-year-old
running mine was fascinating

00:04:51.448 --> 00:04:53.400 align:middle line:84%
because I realized I
had all these stories

00:04:53.400 --> 00:04:56.160 align:middle line:84%
about my grandmother
who, during the war,

00:04:56.160 --> 00:04:58.810 align:middle line:84%
had been able to get a
job for the first time.

00:04:58.810 --> 00:05:01.350 align:middle line:84%
So she worked in a
munitions factory.

00:05:01.350 --> 00:05:03.952 align:middle line:84%
And the story was that every
night, she used to come home,

00:05:03.952 --> 00:05:06.410 align:middle line:84%
wash out her underwear because
she only had one set, put it

00:05:06.410 --> 00:05:09.400 align:middle line:84%
on the fender to dry so she
could go back the next day.

00:05:09.400 --> 00:05:11.760 align:middle line:84%
And her-- she was doing
it because her target was

00:05:11.760 --> 00:05:15.600 align:middle line:84%
to save 100 pounds, and
that 100 pounds then

00:05:15.600 --> 00:05:18.760 align:middle line:84%
became the deposit for their
first house, which then

00:05:18.760 --> 00:05:21.300 align:middle line:84%
launched them onto a different
business of making money

00:05:21.300 --> 00:05:23.110 align:middle line:90%
by doing up property.

00:05:23.110 --> 00:05:24.520 align:middle line:90%
So that was the family story.

00:05:24.520 --> 00:05:26.620 align:middle line:84%
And then, when I started
to dig behind it,

00:05:26.620 --> 00:05:28.830 align:middle line:84%
I thought, actually,
my story was

00:05:28.830 --> 00:05:31.080 align:middle line:90%
that making money was hard work.

00:05:31.080 --> 00:05:34.340 align:middle line:84%
So you could make money, but
you had to work hard at it.

00:05:34.340 --> 00:05:36.340 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: That's most
people's belief, isn't it?

00:05:36.340 --> 00:05:37.770 align:middle line:84%
>>SMITH: Well, actually,
you might think it is.

00:05:37.770 --> 00:05:38.894 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: But no, it's not?

00:05:38.894 --> 00:05:41.770 align:middle line:84%
Well, we all think it's-- most
people think it's hard work.

00:05:41.770 --> 00:05:44.320 align:middle line:84%
>>SMITH: Well, but what
was fascinating about doing

00:05:44.320 --> 00:05:47.060 align:middle line:84%
the money breakthrough was
doing accounts for other people

00:05:47.060 --> 00:05:47.720 align:middle line:90%
who had different beliefs.

00:05:47.720 --> 00:05:48.275 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: OK, good.

00:05:48.275 --> 00:05:49.410 align:middle line:90%
I can't wait until we get--

00:05:49.410 --> 00:05:50.390 align:middle line:90%
>>SMITH: That was fascinating.

00:05:50.390 --> 00:05:52.140 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: --into some
of these archetypes.

00:05:52.140 --> 00:05:53.940 align:middle line:10%
>>SMITH: So my-- so
what I discovered was

00:05:53.940 --> 00:05:56.490 align:middle line:10%
I felt that I could--
making money was hard work.

00:05:56.490 --> 00:06:00.090 align:middle line:10%
So of course, when I then
looked around, in my experience,

00:06:00.090 --> 00:06:03.270 align:middle line:10%
I was surrounded by lots of
people who had made money,

00:06:03.270 --> 00:06:06.230 align:middle line:10%
had a lot of money, but
worked extremely hard for it.

00:06:06.230 --> 00:06:08.540 align:middle line:10%
So of course, it
was then going, wow,

00:06:08.540 --> 00:06:11.440 align:middle line:10%
that's my belief
creating that experience.

00:06:11.440 --> 00:06:13.540 align:middle line:10%
And actually, what
then, for me, happened

00:06:13.540 --> 00:06:16.720 align:middle line:10%
was I started to
then look at, well,

00:06:16.720 --> 00:06:18.870 align:middle line:10%
what are other beliefs
have I inherited?

00:06:18.870 --> 00:06:21.860 align:middle line:84%
It was like, what else
am I believing and then

00:06:21.860 --> 00:06:24.960 align:middle line:84%
experiencing, but it's
simply a belief pattern?

00:06:24.960 --> 00:06:29.340 align:middle line:84%
And one of the other
women on the course, she

00:06:29.340 --> 00:06:31.530 align:middle line:84%
said I find making
money really easy.

00:06:31.530 --> 00:06:34.360 align:middle line:84%
She said, but I can't
stop spending it.

00:06:34.360 --> 00:06:37.157 align:middle line:84%
And I went, I don't have
any trouble holding onto it.

00:06:37.157 --> 00:06:38.740 align:middle line:84%
So it was like-- and
what we had there

00:06:38.740 --> 00:06:42.710 align:middle line:84%
was a completely different
money story-- so a lot of guilt

00:06:42.710 --> 00:06:46.190 align:middle line:84%
around having money and
people who had money.

00:06:46.190 --> 00:06:48.210 align:middle line:10%
So actually, when I
started to investigate

00:06:48.210 --> 00:06:50.410 align:middle line:10%
that, what I found was
there was a huge variety

00:06:50.410 --> 00:06:51.619 align:middle line:10%
of money stories.

00:06:51.619 --> 00:06:53.160 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Yes, and
we're going to get

00:06:53.160 --> 00:06:56.510 align:middle line:84%
into them, all the
archetypes, in great detail.

00:06:56.510 --> 00:06:57.820 align:middle line:90%
Which ones work well together?

00:06:57.820 --> 00:07:00.510 align:middle line:84%
Which ones have
built-in challenge?

00:07:00.510 --> 00:07:02.160 align:middle line:90%
But let's back up just a minute.

00:07:02.160 --> 00:07:05.786 align:middle line:84%
How does bioresonance factor
into this whole story?

00:07:05.786 --> 00:07:06.910 align:middle line:90%
And how did that crossover?

00:07:06.910 --> 00:07:09.827 align:middle line:84%
So you were interested
in energy prior to this.

00:07:09.827 --> 00:07:11.910 align:middle line:84%
Let's talk about that,
your children and so forth.

00:07:11.910 --> 00:07:14.680 align:middle line:84%
>>SMITH: So what happened there
was-- I have three children,

00:07:14.680 --> 00:07:20.100 align:middle line:84%
and when-- oh, I think probably
10, 11 years ago, two of them

00:07:20.100 --> 00:07:22.362 align:middle line:84%
had been diagnosed
dyslexic, and I was really

00:07:22.362 --> 00:07:24.070 align:middle line:84%
looking for something
that would actually

00:07:24.070 --> 00:07:26.710 align:middle line:84%
help support them
cope with school.

00:07:26.710 --> 00:07:29.670 align:middle line:84%
And I came across the work
of a lady called Jane Lloyd

00:07:29.670 --> 00:07:31.900 align:middle line:84%
and took my
son-in-law to see her.

00:07:31.900 --> 00:07:34.830 align:middle line:84%
And actually, what she helped
me to see was that, actually,

00:07:34.830 --> 00:07:36.990 align:middle line:90%
Patrick was just hypersensitive.

00:07:36.990 --> 00:07:39.229 align:middle line:84%
So he had
hypersensitive hearing.

00:07:39.229 --> 00:07:40.520 align:middle line:90%
Everybody had test his hearing.

00:07:40.520 --> 00:07:42.280 align:middle line:84%
He didn't speak until
he was 3 and 1/2,

00:07:42.280 --> 00:07:45.620 align:middle line:84%
so there'd been real
concerns when he was younger.

00:07:45.620 --> 00:07:48.170 align:middle line:84%
So I was looking for
something to help him,

00:07:48.170 --> 00:07:52.340 align:middle line:84%
found this whole concept
of hypersensitivity,

00:07:52.340 --> 00:07:55.040 align:middle line:84%
and I actually remember sitting,
filling out the questionnaires,

00:07:55.040 --> 00:07:57.320 align:middle line:90%
going, well, my son does that.

00:07:57.320 --> 00:07:58.070 align:middle line:90%
Patrick does that.

00:07:58.070 --> 00:07:59.470 align:middle line:90%
Holly does that.

00:07:59.470 --> 00:08:00.940 align:middle line:84%
And ooh, I do that
one-- and just

00:08:00.940 --> 00:08:03.000 align:middle line:84%
going through these
questionnaires,

00:08:03.000 --> 00:08:08.280 align:middle line:84%
understanding not just my son,
but my daughter and me as well.

00:08:08.280 --> 00:08:11.700 align:middle line:84%
And so it really-- it
had such an impact on me

00:08:11.700 --> 00:08:15.070 align:middle line:84%
that not only did I take
then my other daughter,

00:08:15.070 --> 00:08:17.660 align:middle line:84%
I actually then started to work
with Jane to help her develop.

00:08:17.660 --> 00:08:21.750 align:middle line:84%
And she had at the time
a really complex therapy,

00:08:21.750 --> 00:08:27.040 align:middle line:84%
which was nutritional, sound,
lights, movement, detox,

00:08:27.040 --> 00:08:29.370 align:middle line:84%
everything; and it
was very expensive.

00:08:29.370 --> 00:08:32.366 align:middle line:84%
It was a six-month waiting
list, and she really-- you

00:08:32.366 --> 00:08:35.900 align:middle line:84%
had to-- you had to have
resource to be able to do it.

00:08:35.900 --> 00:08:39.165 align:middle line:84%
And so she had discovered
bioresonance, largely

00:08:39.165 --> 00:08:42.470 align:middle line:84%
through allergy testing, which
was where it was being used.

00:08:42.470 --> 00:08:44.790 align:middle line:84%
And she met with
one of the chaps who

00:08:44.790 --> 00:08:47.740 align:middle line:84%
developed the
bioresonance computer,

00:08:47.740 --> 00:08:50.190 align:middle line:84%
a chap called Victor
Simms, and said, OK,

00:08:50.190 --> 00:08:53.190 align:middle line:84%
can we put what I
do into a program

00:08:53.190 --> 00:08:54.490 align:middle line:90%
to run on the bioresonance?

00:08:54.490 --> 00:08:57.480 align:middle line:84%
And he sort of thought about
it and says yes, we can.

00:08:57.480 --> 00:08:59.121 align:middle line:84%
So that then started
this process--

00:08:59.121 --> 00:09:01.120 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So it's kind
of frequencies supporting

00:09:01.120 --> 00:09:02.590 align:middle line:84%
the changes that
you were seeking.

00:09:02.590 --> 00:09:04.048 align:middle line:84%
>>SMITH: So what
we were looking at

00:09:04.048 --> 00:09:07.220 align:middle line:84%
was using resonant
frequency patterns

00:09:07.220 --> 00:09:10.740 align:middle line:84%
to de-stress, essentially,
which is why we ended up

00:09:10.740 --> 00:09:13.060 align:middle line:84%
calling ourselves
aCREATIVEspace.

00:09:13.060 --> 00:09:17.660 align:middle line:84%
So what we were doing was
using the bioresonance program

00:09:17.660 --> 00:09:20.300 align:middle line:84%
and resonant frequency
patterns to actually create

00:09:20.300 --> 00:09:21.800 align:middle line:90%
space, de-stress.

00:09:21.800 --> 00:09:24.710 align:middle line:84%
And of course, what we
found with the children was

00:09:24.710 --> 00:09:27.420 align:middle line:84%
as we took the stress
out of their experience,

00:09:27.420 --> 00:09:29.670 align:middle line:84%
which was because of
the hypersensitivity,

00:09:29.670 --> 00:09:31.460 align:middle line:84%
they began to perform
better at school,

00:09:31.460 --> 00:09:34.400 align:middle line:84%
but it was sort of a side
effect to actually just removing

00:09:34.400 --> 00:09:35.650 align:middle line:90%
the stress.

00:09:35.650 --> 00:09:37.130 align:middle line:84%
And so we were
working with-- we'd

00:09:37.130 --> 00:09:39.340 align:middle line:84%
start working with the
children, and then we'd

00:09:39.340 --> 00:09:41.480 align:middle line:84%
find that mums would
say, well, this is great,

00:09:41.480 --> 00:09:43.220 align:middle line:84%
but my husband's
really stressed.

00:09:43.220 --> 00:09:44.930 align:middle line:90%
He needs some of this.

00:09:44.930 --> 00:09:47.850 align:middle line:84%
And so we started then
to run whole families.

00:09:47.850 --> 00:09:50.380 align:middle line:84%
But also, what I could
see was-- my background

00:09:50.380 --> 00:09:52.780 align:middle line:84%
was that I'd been a lawyer
and a management consultant,

00:09:52.780 --> 00:09:54.880 align:middle line:84%
and I'd worked with
small businesses.

00:09:54.880 --> 00:09:56.610 align:middle line:84%
And I could see that
actually, once you

00:09:56.610 --> 00:09:59.610 align:middle line:84%
start to look at the world
in terms of frequency,

00:09:59.610 --> 00:10:01.980 align:middle line:84%
everything's a frequency,
including business.

00:10:01.980 --> 00:10:06.010 align:middle line:84%
So the whole thing expanded
from just children and families

00:10:06.010 --> 00:10:07.890 align:middle line:90%
through to running businesses.

00:10:07.890 --> 00:10:10.530 align:middle line:84%
So that was-- we
then set-- we also

00:10:10.530 --> 00:10:14.370 align:middle line:84%
were running our business on
that-- on those principles.

00:10:14.370 --> 00:10:15.905 align:middle line:84%
And as we started
to do that, that

00:10:15.905 --> 00:10:19.150 align:middle line:84%
was when the investigation
around money came as well.

00:10:19.150 --> 00:10:22.340 align:middle line:84%
This felt like, well, we
could remove the stress.

00:10:22.340 --> 00:10:24.680 align:middle line:84%
It felt like there was
a conscious component

00:10:24.680 --> 00:10:26.389 align:middle line:84%
as well that would
really support people.

00:10:26.389 --> 00:10:28.596 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So when you work
with people on this level,

00:10:28.596 --> 00:10:30.320 align:middle line:84%
before we even get
into it, are you

00:10:30.320 --> 00:10:32.770 align:middle line:84%
finding that you're having
success with people?

00:10:32.770 --> 00:10:34.960 align:middle line:84%
Are they shifting
their relationship

00:10:34.960 --> 00:10:37.870 align:middle line:84%
to the notion of what
money and abundance is?

00:10:37.870 --> 00:10:39.640 align:middle line:84%
>>SMITH: Yes, and
that's when I find

00:10:39.640 --> 00:10:41.720 align:middle line:84%
that one of the really
winning combinations

00:10:41.720 --> 00:10:45.080 align:middle line:84%
is to use the sacred money
archetypes with the support

00:10:45.080 --> 00:10:47.420 align:middle line:84%
in the background of
the bioresonance program

00:10:47.420 --> 00:10:50.530 align:middle line:84%
because as people start
to engage with the money,

00:10:50.530 --> 00:10:52.240 align:middle line:90%
it can bring up a lot of stress.

00:10:52.240 --> 00:10:54.480 align:middle line:84%
There's a lot of reason why
we won't engage with it.

00:10:54.480 --> 00:10:58.270 align:middle line:84%
So having the support of the
bioresonance behind actually

00:10:58.270 --> 00:11:01.850 align:middle line:84%
just-- creating the space,
removing the stress as people

00:11:01.850 --> 00:11:05.730 align:middle line:84%
start to move through and
address those belief patterns

00:11:05.730 --> 00:11:08.590 align:middle line:84%
and really start to
engage with money.

00:11:08.590 --> 00:11:10.620 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So say people
can't do bioresonance.

00:11:10.620 --> 00:11:12.270 align:middle line:84%
In a sense,
everything is energy.

00:11:12.270 --> 00:11:15.650 align:middle line:84%
What else might one do before
they start down this road

00:11:15.650 --> 00:11:17.800 align:middle line:84%
to support themselves
while they're

00:11:17.800 --> 00:11:20.410 align:middle line:84%
doing this work with
the money archetypes?

00:11:20.410 --> 00:11:22.660 align:middle line:84%
Some other practices,
some other things?

00:11:22.660 --> 00:11:27.120 align:middle line:84%
>>SMITH: Well, one of the things
that really helps is-- well,

00:11:27.120 --> 00:11:29.700 align:middle line:84%
we'll talk-- I know we're going
to talk about the archetypes.

00:11:29.700 --> 00:11:35.173 align:middle line:84%
But really, if you have any
practice around yoga or-- one

00:11:35.173 --> 00:11:38.050 align:middle line:84%
of the things I've been looking
at recently is all the--

00:11:38.050 --> 00:11:42.900 align:middle line:84%
a lot of around breath
and using-- really,

00:11:42.900 --> 00:11:45.980 align:middle line:84%
any practice that you have that
helps you to cope with stress

00:11:45.980 --> 00:11:47.695 align:middle line:84%
will create the
space in the same way

00:11:47.695 --> 00:11:49.640 align:middle line:90%
as any of these things.

00:11:49.640 --> 00:11:50.390 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: OK, yes.

00:11:50.390 --> 00:11:52.460 align:middle line:84%
I just wanted to lay that
down so people don't say--

00:11:52.460 --> 00:11:52.550 align:middle line:90%
>>SMITH: Oh, no.

00:11:52.550 --> 00:11:52.900 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: I can't
get to bioresonance.

00:11:52.900 --> 00:11:53.120 align:middle line:90%
>>SMITH: No, not at all.

00:11:53.120 --> 00:11:54.520 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: This
won't work for me.

00:11:54.520 --> 00:11:57.020 align:middle line:84%
>>SMITH: No, absolutely,
because I just-- there are

00:11:57.020 --> 00:12:00.020 align:middle line:84%
lots of sacred money
archetype consultants--

00:12:00.020 --> 00:12:01.520 align:middle line:84%
coaches out there,
and they all have

00:12:01.520 --> 00:12:02.644 align:middle line:90%
different ways of doing it.

00:12:02.644 --> 00:12:04.400 align:middle line:84%
The bioresonance is
just the way that I--

00:12:04.400 --> 00:12:05.608 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: But it makes sense.

00:12:05.608 --> 00:12:07.920 align:middle line:84%
I mean, to just start
reducing the baseline stress

00:12:07.920 --> 00:12:09.870 align:middle line:84%
in our lives and
anxiety physically

00:12:09.870 --> 00:12:11.370 align:middle line:84%
as well as emotionally
and mentally.

00:12:11.370 --> 00:12:14.290 align:middle line:84%
And as you say, something as
simple as the ancient forms

00:12:14.290 --> 00:12:16.790 align:middle line:84%
of breath, something
as simple as breathing

00:12:16.790 --> 00:12:19.960 align:middle line:84%
in to the count of 10, holding
to 10, releasing to 10--

00:12:19.960 --> 00:12:22.780 align:middle line:84%
do that for a few minutes,
and your entire chemistry

00:12:22.780 --> 00:12:23.950 align:middle line:90%
has changed.

00:12:23.950 --> 00:12:26.010 align:middle line:84%
Literally, your
biochemistry has changed.

00:12:26.010 --> 00:12:28.290 align:middle line:84%
>>SMITH: Yeah, because
what-- what-- well,

00:12:28.290 --> 00:12:30.610 align:middle line:84%
what I feel with the money
is that, actually, it

00:12:30.610 --> 00:12:34.424 align:middle line:84%
provides this extraordinary
pathway through to becoming

00:12:34.424 --> 00:12:36.090 align:middle line:84%
a greater expression
who you really are.

00:12:36.090 --> 00:12:37.210 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: I think
so, because when

00:12:37.210 --> 00:12:38.751 align:middle line:84%
you think of the
reverse of it, which

00:12:38.751 --> 00:12:40.700 align:middle line:84%
is people and their
anxieties around money,

00:12:40.700 --> 00:12:43.570 align:middle line:84%
it creates a lesser
version of who we are.

00:12:43.570 --> 00:12:46.640 align:middle line:84%
And we're held hostage to it,
and we're in the pursuit of it,

00:12:46.640 --> 00:12:48.340 align:middle line:84%
and then we're not
looking to expand

00:12:48.340 --> 00:12:50.730 align:middle line:90%
other aspects of our own being.

00:12:50.730 --> 00:12:54.230 align:middle line:84%
>>SMITH: Yeah, so
what my experience is

00:12:54.230 --> 00:12:56.590 align:middle line:84%
when you start to
engage with it,

00:12:56.590 --> 00:13:01.480 align:middle line:84%
it's like you feel
that boundary,

00:13:01.480 --> 00:13:04.580 align:middle line:84%
and so any practice
that you have that

00:13:04.580 --> 00:13:07.890 align:middle line:84%
will keep you at that boundary,
rather than pulling away

00:13:07.890 --> 00:13:11.510 align:middle line:84%
from it-- because it's like,
when you-- I find with people,

00:13:11.510 --> 00:13:13.910 align:middle line:84%
with money, one of the
things is that often, people

00:13:13.910 --> 00:13:16.655 align:middle line:84%
find they won't even
look at the money.

00:13:16.655 --> 00:13:17.780 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: It's too painful.

00:13:17.780 --> 00:13:18.210 align:middle line:90%
>>SMITH: It's just too painful.

00:13:18.210 --> 00:13:19.610 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: There's too
much fear around it.

00:13:19.610 --> 00:13:21.276 align:middle line:84%
>>SMITH: There's so
much fear around it,

00:13:21.276 --> 00:13:24.610 align:middle line:84%
but actually, for me, it's
like that's the opportunity.

00:13:24.610 --> 00:13:26.010 align:middle line:84%
That's the
opportunity that money

00:13:26.010 --> 00:13:30.660 align:middle line:84%
provides, is to actually meet
that fear and move through it.

00:13:30.660 --> 00:13:34.230 align:middle line:84%
And I feel it's much easier
to almost do it with something

00:13:34.230 --> 00:13:36.335 align:middle line:84%
like money than it is
to do it in other areas.

00:13:36.335 --> 00:13:38.710 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: With some other
trauma that's happened in life.

00:13:38.710 --> 00:13:38.980 align:middle line:90%
>>SMITH: Yeah.

00:13:38.980 --> 00:13:40.960 align:middle line:84%
And how you do money is
how you do everything,

00:13:40.960 --> 00:13:42.940 align:middle line:90%
so it's-- and it's a hologram.

00:13:42.940 --> 00:13:43.940 align:middle line:90%
It's holographic.

00:13:43.940 --> 00:13:46.080 align:middle line:84%
So it's like, take the
opportunity that money's

00:13:46.080 --> 00:13:49.810 align:middle line:84%
giving you to feel that,
to move to that place

00:13:49.810 --> 00:13:52.250 align:middle line:84%
where you feel the fear,
because all the fear

00:13:52.250 --> 00:13:54.540 align:middle line:84%
is telling you is
that you're starting

00:13:54.540 --> 00:13:57.300 align:middle line:84%
to believe that your challenges
are greater than your gifts,

00:13:57.300 --> 00:14:00.005 align:middle line:84%
and that means you've
forgotten who you are.

00:14:00.005 --> 00:14:00.880 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Absolutely.

00:14:00.880 --> 00:14:04.180 align:middle line:84%
And we need to say right up
front that just because someone

00:14:04.180 --> 00:14:06.150 align:middle line:84%
has a great deal
of money does not

00:14:06.150 --> 00:14:07.810 align:middle line:84%
mean they're exempt
from that fear.

00:14:07.810 --> 00:14:10.062 align:middle line:90%
And sometimes, it's even worse.

00:14:10.062 --> 00:14:11.770 align:middle line:84%
And you've noticed
that in your own work.

00:14:11.770 --> 00:14:12.353 align:middle line:90%
>>SMITH: Yeah.

00:14:12.353 --> 00:14:13.990 align:middle line:84%
That's been also
part of my learning.

00:14:13.990 --> 00:14:16.590 align:middle line:84%
One of the archetypes I talk
about is the accumulator,

00:14:16.590 --> 00:14:19.272 align:middle line:84%
and the accumulators appear to
function very well with money,

00:14:19.272 --> 00:14:21.355 align:middle line:84%
but they also have a great
deal of fear around it.

00:14:21.355 --> 00:14:21.896 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: OK.

00:14:21.896 --> 00:14:24.180 align:middle line:84%
I think this is a good time
to go into the-- let's go

00:14:24.180 --> 00:14:26.060 align:middle line:90%
into detail in the archetypes.

00:14:26.060 --> 00:14:28.770 align:middle line:84%
And after that, I'd like
to go into the interaction

00:14:28.770 --> 00:14:32.280 align:middle line:84%
between the archetypes
on a personal level,

00:14:32.280 --> 00:14:35.000 align:middle line:84%
in business, in marriage,
and partnership,

00:14:35.000 --> 00:14:38.910 align:middle line:84%
obviously, so we can-- we
can start seeing ourselves

00:14:38.910 --> 00:14:39.740 align:middle line:90%
in the story.

00:14:39.740 --> 00:14:42.920 align:middle line:84%
And at the very end, we will let
people know where they can go

00:14:42.920 --> 00:14:45.647 align:middle line:84%
to take their self-test so they
can determine what kind of--

00:14:45.647 --> 00:14:46.980 align:middle line:90%
>>SMITH: Find out what they are.

00:14:46.980 --> 00:14:47.750 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Or which types.

00:14:47.750 --> 00:14:49.060 align:middle line:90%
And you're not just one type.

00:14:49.060 --> 00:14:50.930 align:middle line:84%
You're usually a type
with a couple overlays

00:14:50.930 --> 00:14:52.640 align:middle line:90%
or lesser types in there.

00:14:52.640 --> 00:14:55.670 align:middle line:84%
And then, we'll find
out our opposite types

00:14:55.670 --> 00:14:57.380 align:middle line:90%
and what that lesson is for us.

00:14:57.380 --> 00:14:59.380 align:middle line:84%
>>SMITH: Yes, there's
huge growth there as well.

00:14:59.380 --> 00:15:02.130 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: OK, so let's
start out with the ruler.

00:15:02.130 --> 00:15:05.690 align:middle line:84%
>>SMITH: The ruler-- OK,
that's my archetype, actually.

00:15:05.690 --> 00:15:09.240 align:middle line:84%
So each of the archetypes
has a nickname,

00:15:09.240 --> 00:15:13.050 align:middle line:84%
and the ruler's the
inner empire builder.

00:15:13.050 --> 00:15:16.380 align:middle line:84%
And all of the archetypes
have a sacred money contract,

00:15:16.380 --> 00:15:18.940 align:middle line:84%
which is what you've come
to express with money.

00:15:18.940 --> 00:15:23.390 align:middle line:84%
And for the ruler, it's to
innovate, achieve, and empower

00:15:23.390 --> 00:15:25.940 align:middle line:90%
wealth with grace and ease.

00:15:25.940 --> 00:15:29.160 align:middle line:84%
Now, the challenge-- the
sacred money contracts

00:15:29.160 --> 00:15:31.260 align:middle line:84%
have been really
carefully crafted.

00:15:31.260 --> 00:15:33.960 align:middle line:84%
So there'll be one part, and
if it's your archetype, you go,

00:15:33.960 --> 00:15:34.459 align:middle line:90%
yes!

00:15:34.459 --> 00:15:36.450 align:middle line:84%
And there's another
part, you go, ew.

00:15:36.450 --> 00:15:37.770 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Don't want to
see the shadow of it.

00:15:37.770 --> 00:15:38.353 align:middle line:90%
>>SMITH: Yeah.

00:15:38.353 --> 00:15:40.500 align:middle line:84%
So the rulers are
very hardworking.

00:15:40.500 --> 00:15:41.720 align:middle line:90%
They're very driven.

00:15:41.720 --> 00:15:45.600 align:middle line:84%
They have an enormous
capacity for work

00:15:45.600 --> 00:15:47.890 align:middle line:90%
and for creating prosperity.

00:15:47.890 --> 00:15:50.220 align:middle line:84%
The challenge is the
grace and ease bit

00:15:50.220 --> 00:15:53.670 align:middle line:84%
because they can often
be not very present.

00:15:53.670 --> 00:15:56.170 align:middle line:84%
They tend to have a lot--
they can have a lot of anxiety

00:15:56.170 --> 00:15:58.380 align:middle line:90%
around money running out.

00:15:58.380 --> 00:16:02.360 align:middle line:84%
So what you have with rulers--
each of the archetypes

00:16:02.360 --> 00:16:06.020 align:middle line:84%
has a set of challenges
and gifts as well.

00:16:06.020 --> 00:16:07.990 align:middle line:84%
So the gifts for the
ruler is creating

00:16:07.990 --> 00:16:09.900 align:middle line:84%
an empire where
everyone thrives.

00:16:09.900 --> 00:16:12.050 align:middle line:84%
That's what rulers
really want to do.

00:16:12.050 --> 00:16:14.530 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So give us an example
of who might be rulers out

00:16:14.530 --> 00:16:17.029 align:middle line:84%
there and what that might look
like if a ruler's doing money

00:16:17.029 --> 00:16:18.200 align:middle line:90%
well.

00:16:18.200 --> 00:16:20.840 align:middle line:10%
>>SMITH: An entrepreneur
would be, I think,

00:16:20.840 --> 00:16:25.845 align:middle line:10%
probably one of the classic for
a net ruler, because there, it

00:16:25.845 --> 00:16:28.080 align:middle line:10%
is about creating an empire.

00:16:28.080 --> 00:16:31.860 align:middle line:84%
And each of the archetypes
has a high vibration

00:16:31.860 --> 00:16:32.960 align:middle line:90%
and a low vibration.

00:16:32.960 --> 00:16:34.780 align:middle line:84%
So the high vibration
of the ruler

00:16:34.780 --> 00:16:37.737 align:middle line:90%
is this sort of benevolence.

00:16:37.737 --> 00:16:39.320 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: You want
to create something

00:16:39.320 --> 00:16:41.150 align:middle line:84%
which everyone's
going to benefit from.

00:16:41.150 --> 00:16:41.983 align:middle line:90%
>>SMITH: Absolutely.

00:16:41.983 --> 00:16:44.870 align:middle line:84%
And they're very, very
innovative and decisive.

00:16:44.870 --> 00:16:49.130 align:middle line:84%
But the lower vibration is
they become very controlling,

00:16:49.130 --> 00:16:50.570 align:middle line:84%
so they're a bit
like a dictator.

00:16:50.570 --> 00:16:52.110 align:middle line:84%
So it's like my
way or the highway.

00:16:52.110 --> 00:16:54.580 align:middle line:10%
And they push
people really hard.

00:16:54.580 --> 00:16:58.160 align:middle line:84%
So that's the-- so
often-- in entrepreneur,

00:16:58.160 --> 00:17:00.550 align:middle line:84%
it's quite a good thing
to have ruler somewhere

00:17:00.550 --> 00:17:04.040 align:middle line:84%
because it is about
having an eye to all

00:17:04.040 --> 00:17:07.589 align:middle line:84%
the different functions and
being able to sort of have

00:17:07.589 --> 00:17:12.095 align:middle line:84%
that overview without
becoming that controlling.

00:17:12.095 --> 00:17:13.720 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: But they
wouldn't necessarily

00:17:13.720 --> 00:17:15.500 align:middle line:90%
have a Pollyanna-type streak.

00:17:15.500 --> 00:17:17.819 align:middle line:84%
They're not going in blindly,
generally, with money?

00:17:17.819 --> 00:17:19.329 align:middle line:90%
They would have a business plan.

00:17:19.329 --> 00:17:20.954 align:middle line:84%
Would that be more
the mark of a ruler?

00:17:20.954 --> 00:17:21.704 align:middle line:90%
Someone who does--

00:17:21.704 --> 00:17:23.660 align:middle line:84%
>>SMITH: Yeah, so rulers
are good with money.

00:17:23.660 --> 00:17:26.740 align:middle line:84%
They are high
functioning with money.

00:17:26.740 --> 00:17:29.670 align:middle line:10%
They're usually very
organized with money.

00:17:29.670 --> 00:17:31.180 align:middle line:84%
And the downside
is just that they

00:17:31.180 --> 00:17:33.460 align:middle line:84%
can get very anxious
about how much money they

00:17:33.460 --> 00:17:36.670 align:middle line:84%
feel they have to
have to retire.

00:17:36.670 --> 00:17:40.290 align:middle line:84%
And they can often
not enjoy the moment.

00:17:40.290 --> 00:17:42.770 align:middle line:84%
They're always like
that forward motion

00:17:42.770 --> 00:17:45.420 align:middle line:90%
of more, more, more, more, more.

00:17:45.420 --> 00:17:50.105 align:middle line:84%
But that growth can be
being driven by fear of it

00:17:50.105 --> 00:17:50.980 align:middle line:90%
all being taken away.

00:17:50.980 --> 00:17:52.950 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Of not having
enough, no matter how much.

00:17:52.950 --> 00:17:53.533 align:middle line:90%
>>SMITH: Yeah.

00:17:53.533 --> 00:17:55.940 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So some of the people
we would read about, say,

00:17:55.940 --> 00:17:58.360 align:middle line:84%
in the financial sections
of our newspapers

00:17:58.360 --> 00:18:01.497 align:middle line:84%
would often fall under
the ruler category?

00:18:01.497 --> 00:18:02.080 align:middle line:90%
>>SMITH: Yeah.

00:18:02.080 --> 00:18:05.390 align:middle line:84%
I think they would be normally
like sort of where they've

00:18:05.390 --> 00:18:08.650 align:middle line:84%
got to a position of power,
where they have a lot of people

00:18:08.650 --> 00:18:10.970 align:middle line:84%
who are responsible to
them, that would be-- I

00:18:10.970 --> 00:18:14.700 align:middle line:84%
would expect to see
a ruler doing that.

00:18:14.700 --> 00:18:18.840 align:middle line:84%
And actually, each
of the archetypes

00:18:18.840 --> 00:18:22.530 align:middle line:84%
also relates to the
function within a business.

00:18:22.530 --> 00:18:25.140 align:middle line:10%
So one of the ways you
can use the archetypes

00:18:25.140 --> 00:18:27.940 align:middle line:10%
is really-- there's
no archetype that's

00:18:27.940 --> 00:18:30.910 align:middle line:10%
better at making money
than another archetype.

00:18:30.910 --> 00:18:33.150 align:middle line:84%
It's really just about
knowing who you are.

00:18:33.150 --> 00:18:35.860 align:middle line:84%
So all the archetypes
have the capacity

00:18:35.860 --> 00:18:38.460 align:middle line:90%
to make-- to be very wealthy.

00:18:38.460 --> 00:18:41.880 align:middle line:84%
It's not-- there's
no one that's-- no,

00:18:41.880 --> 00:18:44.430 align:middle line:90%
you're condemned to.

00:18:44.430 --> 00:18:46.160 align:middle line:90%
So they all have that ability.

00:18:46.160 --> 00:18:48.350 align:middle line:84%
And the fascinating
thing is, really,

00:18:48.350 --> 00:18:50.120 align:middle line:84%
to be able to move
it into a business

00:18:50.120 --> 00:18:54.000 align:middle line:84%
to be able to see whether
the different functions,

00:18:54.000 --> 00:18:57.670 align:middle line:84%
different archetypes, will
settle into really nicely.

00:18:57.670 --> 00:19:01.980 align:middle line:84%
And for the ruler-- rulers are
very good around marketing.

00:19:01.980 --> 00:19:04.200 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: OK, what about
now the accumulator?

00:19:04.200 --> 00:19:06.400 align:middle line:10%
>>SMITH: Accumulator--
now, the accumulator

00:19:06.400 --> 00:19:08.640 align:middle line:10%
is the inner banker.

00:19:08.640 --> 00:19:11.360 align:middle line:84%
So that's a nickname
for the accumulator.

00:19:11.360 --> 00:19:14.080 align:middle line:84%
And their sacred
money contract is

00:19:14.080 --> 00:19:17.990 align:middle line:84%
to respect the power of money
by investing to create freedom.

00:19:17.990 --> 00:19:21.130 align:middle line:84%
So the easy bit for
that is respecting

00:19:21.130 --> 00:19:23.510 align:middle line:90%
money for accumulators.

00:19:23.510 --> 00:19:26.500 align:middle line:84%
The challenging bit is
investing to create freedom,

00:19:26.500 --> 00:19:29.440 align:middle line:84%
because accumulators
love to accumulate money.

00:19:29.440 --> 00:19:32.940 align:middle line:84%
They get very anxious
about letting money go,

00:19:32.940 --> 00:19:35.910 align:middle line:84%
so they can have a lot of
anxiety around running out

00:19:35.910 --> 00:19:38.750 align:middle line:84%
of money, and it is
almost like there's never

00:19:38.750 --> 00:19:41.446 align:middle line:90%
enough for accumulators.

00:19:41.446 --> 00:19:43.070 align:middle line:84%
But very kind--
appears to be very high

00:19:43.070 --> 00:19:45.210 align:middle line:84%
functioning with money, so
they're very financially

00:19:45.210 --> 00:19:49.282 align:middle line:84%
responsible, very
rarely get into debt.

00:19:49.282 --> 00:19:51.365 align:middle line:84%
And if they did, that would
cause so much anxiety,

00:19:51.365 --> 00:19:53.460 align:middle line:90%
it would be very traumatic.

00:19:53.460 --> 00:19:56.430 align:middle line:84%
So they love to
accumulate money.

00:19:56.430 --> 00:19:58.601 align:middle line:84%
So that's the
highest expression.

00:19:58.601 --> 00:19:59.850 align:middle line:90%
It is like they're the banker.

00:19:59.850 --> 00:20:03.000 align:middle line:84%
The lowest expression
is the miser.

00:20:03.000 --> 00:20:06.890 align:middle line:84%
Got to hold onto it a little
bit tighter-- really tightly.

00:20:06.890 --> 00:20:08.140 align:middle line:10%
So yes, they save money.

00:20:08.140 --> 00:20:10.470 align:middle line:84%
They're very-- they're usually
financially independent

00:20:10.470 --> 00:20:13.520 align:middle line:84%
and very financially
responsible.

00:20:13.520 --> 00:20:17.410 align:middle line:10%
And I really-- I have--
accumulator's my second.

00:20:17.410 --> 00:20:19.860 align:middle line:84%
So when you do the assessment,
what you're looking at

00:20:19.860 --> 00:20:21.350 align:middle line:90%
are your top three.

00:20:21.350 --> 00:20:22.965 align:middle line:84%
The top one is your
primary archetype.

00:20:22.965 --> 00:20:26.170 align:middle line:84%
The second-- and then you
look at the second two.

00:20:26.170 --> 00:20:29.390 align:middle line:84%
They expand what's possible
for that top archetype.

00:20:29.390 --> 00:20:33.730 align:middle line:84%
So they help that top archetype
to overcome the challenges.

00:20:33.730 --> 00:20:35.980 align:middle line:84%
So you'll never be-- it's
not that I'm an accumulator,

00:20:35.980 --> 00:20:38.607 align:middle line:84%
but it figures very
strongly in my pattern.

00:20:38.607 --> 00:20:40.940 align:middle line:84%
And I found that I really
struggled with the accumulator

00:20:40.940 --> 00:20:43.420 align:middle line:84%
to find a good
feeling around it,

00:20:43.420 --> 00:20:46.080 align:middle line:84%
because even just
inner banker-- I mean,

00:20:46.080 --> 00:20:48.670 align:middle line:84%
it's not the nicest
name to have these days.

00:20:48.670 --> 00:20:51.510 align:middle line:84%
But what I realized is
accumulators at that higher

00:20:51.510 --> 00:20:55.090 align:middle line:84%
expression, they just really
love money, and that's OK.

00:20:55.090 --> 00:20:56.784 align:middle line:90%
They will look after money.

00:20:56.784 --> 00:20:57.700 align:middle line:90%
They'll nurture money.

00:20:57.700 --> 00:21:00.420 align:middle line:10%
They'll look-- they love money.

00:21:00.420 --> 00:21:03.640 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Interestingly,
after I learned

00:21:03.640 --> 00:21:06.470 align:middle line:84%
about your work
and your website,

00:21:06.470 --> 00:21:09.430 align:middle line:84%
I had some of my
friends take the test,

00:21:09.430 --> 00:21:16.020 align:middle line:84%
and what I found interesting
is the women who were single

00:21:16.020 --> 00:21:20.110 align:middle line:84%
and fully responsible for
their own financial well-being,

00:21:20.110 --> 00:21:23.490 align:middle line:84%
almost without exception,
had accumulator

00:21:23.490 --> 00:21:27.270 align:middle line:84%
in the top one or
two, out of necessity.

00:21:27.270 --> 00:21:32.760 align:middle line:84%
I mean, how-- that's not
necessarily who we might be,

00:21:32.760 --> 00:21:34.307 align:middle line:90%
but you see what I'm saying?

00:21:34.307 --> 00:21:36.140 align:middle line:10%
>>SMITH: I do, and what
would be interesting

00:21:36.140 --> 00:21:43.450 align:middle line:10%
would be to know whether all
single women or single mums

00:21:43.450 --> 00:21:48.710 align:middle line:10%
have that, or whether they
have-- they are financially

00:21:48.710 --> 00:21:50.932 align:middle line:10%
responsible because
they have that.

00:21:50.932 --> 00:21:52.390 align:middle line:84%
It's like-- do you
see what I mean?

00:21:52.390 --> 00:21:53.200 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes, chicken or egg.

00:21:53.200 --> 00:21:55.870 align:middle line:84%
>>SMITH: So it is whether
it's chicken or egg, because I

00:21:55.870 --> 00:21:58.540 align:middle line:84%
can think of lots of single
mums that aren't financially

00:21:58.540 --> 00:22:01.190 align:middle line:84%
responsible and don't
have accumulator in there.

00:22:01.190 --> 00:22:06.640 align:middle line:84%
So some of it is actually
just a resonance pattern.

00:22:06.640 --> 00:22:09.680 align:middle line:10%
But yes, you would
expect-- they would

00:22:09.680 --> 00:22:13.530 align:middle line:10%
be the single mums who would
be financially independent,

00:22:13.530 --> 00:22:16.330 align:middle line:10%
single women who are
financially independent.

00:22:16.330 --> 00:22:20.670 align:middle line:84%
The question, then, is
whether that's a natural one

00:22:20.670 --> 00:22:22.490 align:middle line:90%
or whether it's a--

00:22:22.490 --> 00:22:24.660 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Driven by
fear and forced and--

00:22:24.660 --> 00:22:27.810 align:middle line:84%
>>SMITH: But again, it's almost
as though it doesn't matter.

00:22:27.810 --> 00:22:30.870 align:middle line:84%
It sort of becomes part of
their relationship with money.

00:22:30.870 --> 00:22:33.360 align:middle line:10%
And actually, for
me, I think where

00:22:33.360 --> 00:22:37.640 align:middle line:10%
you have women who have that
accumulator-- that, I think,

00:22:37.640 --> 00:22:42.156 align:middle line:10%
is really-- that's fascinating
and actually quite-- I

00:22:42.156 --> 00:22:43.780 align:middle line:10%
get quite excited
about that because it

00:22:43.780 --> 00:22:46.630 align:middle line:10%
is like the more women
who have accumulator

00:22:46.630 --> 00:22:48.980 align:middle line:10%
in those top three--
that, I think,

00:22:48.980 --> 00:22:51.410 align:middle line:10%
starts to really change
the energy of money.

00:22:51.410 --> 00:22:53.050 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes, I would think so.

00:22:53.050 --> 00:22:55.520 align:middle line:84%
Also, I'm wondering,
culturally, have you noticed--

00:22:55.520 --> 00:22:57.240 align:middle line:84%
before we go on to
the other types--

00:22:57.240 --> 00:23:01.660 align:middle line:84%
have you noticed, culturally,
among your clientele, friends,

00:23:01.660 --> 00:23:06.270 align:middle line:84%
and so forth, if there is
a different kind of split

00:23:06.270 --> 00:23:08.020 align:middle line:90%
on the subject of accumulator?

00:23:08.020 --> 00:23:13.020 align:middle line:84%
For example, we think of
Americans and the whole culture

00:23:13.020 --> 00:23:15.760 align:middle line:84%
being central-- money
being so central

00:23:15.760 --> 00:23:19.790 align:middle line:84%
to the American culture-- money
and endeavor and so forth.

00:23:19.790 --> 00:23:21.690 align:middle line:84%
You wouldn't be
surprised to find

00:23:21.690 --> 00:23:23.550 align:middle line:84%
a fairly high rate
of accumulators.

00:23:23.550 --> 00:23:26.390 align:middle line:84%
But then you think of people--
we would think of people--

00:23:26.390 --> 00:23:29.420 align:middle line:84%
for example in the more
Latin countries or Greece

00:23:29.420 --> 00:23:32.360 align:middle line:84%
or something, where the
quality of life and being

00:23:32.360 --> 00:23:34.550 align:middle line:84%
with your family and
having a glass of wine

00:23:34.550 --> 00:23:36.160 align:middle line:84%
down by the water
with some sardines

00:23:36.160 --> 00:23:37.900 align:middle line:90%
might make more sense, right?

00:23:37.900 --> 00:23:40.340 align:middle line:90%
Do you see cultural differences?

00:23:40.340 --> 00:23:43.130 align:middle line:84%
>>SMITH: I haven't done a lot of
work with people out of-- I've

00:23:43.130 --> 00:23:45.150 align:middle line:90%
done some work in the States.

00:23:45.150 --> 00:23:49.410 align:middle line:84%
I was-- again, actually, my
own experience-- thinking

00:23:49.410 --> 00:23:54.830 align:middle line:84%
about-- it was a couple, where
the husband was Italian-- or is

00:23:54.830 --> 00:23:57.900 align:middle line:84%
Italian-- and the
wife is English,

00:23:57.900 --> 00:23:59.992 align:middle line:84%
and it's the husband
who has accumulator.

00:23:59.992 --> 00:24:00.700 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Really?

00:24:00.700 --> 00:24:01.283 align:middle line:90%
>>SMITH: Yeah.

00:24:01.283 --> 00:24:02.260 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHTER]

00:24:02.260 --> 00:24:03.890 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So that's
not going to work.

00:24:03.890 --> 00:24:06.550 align:middle line:84%
Just kind of looking
for the exceptions.

00:24:06.550 --> 00:24:09.057 align:middle line:84%
OK, so after that, we
go to the alchemists.

00:24:09.057 --> 00:24:09.890 align:middle line:90%
This is interesting.

00:24:09.890 --> 00:24:11.140 align:middle line:90%
>>SMITH: The alchemists, yeah.

00:24:11.140 --> 00:24:13.590 align:middle line:84%
The alchemist is
the inner idealist.

00:24:13.590 --> 00:24:15.050 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Inner idealist, OK.

00:24:15.050 --> 00:24:15.633 align:middle line:90%
>>SMITH: Yeah.

00:24:15.633 --> 00:24:18.240 align:middle line:10%
So their sacred
money contract is

00:24:18.240 --> 00:24:21.640 align:middle line:10%
to transform ideas
into financial success.

00:24:21.640 --> 00:24:24.730 align:middle line:84%
So alchemists have a real
love/hate relationship

00:24:24.730 --> 00:24:29.624 align:middle line:84%
with money, and they're the
ones that really get the ideas.

00:24:29.624 --> 00:24:31.290 align:middle line:84%
So they're the really
creative thinkers.

00:24:31.290 --> 00:24:33.010 align:middle line:10%
They're incredibly creative.

00:24:33.010 --> 00:24:34.960 align:middle line:84%
Their challenge--
the stretch to them

00:24:34.960 --> 00:24:38.080 align:middle line:84%
is to confirm it, put it
into financial success--

00:24:38.080 --> 00:24:40.990 align:middle line:84%
is to really bring
it into the physical

00:24:40.990 --> 00:24:45.600 align:middle line:84%
and to actually bring that
idea, slow it down, and hold it

00:24:45.600 --> 00:24:49.640 align:middle line:84%
long enough that it can
actually come into form.

00:24:49.640 --> 00:24:53.250 align:middle line:84%
And they can often-- they're
very connected to money,

00:24:53.250 --> 00:24:55.611 align:middle line:84%
but it can be a real love/hate
relationship with it.

00:24:55.611 --> 00:24:57.860 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Because essentially,
they're creative types.

00:24:57.860 --> 00:25:01.650 align:middle line:84%
They're idealistic, and they
have to somehow concretize

00:25:01.650 --> 00:25:05.077 align:middle line:84%
that idea into something
that can be traded on.

00:25:05.077 --> 00:25:06.160 align:middle line:90%
>>SMITH: Yeah, absolutely.

00:25:06.160 --> 00:25:08.810 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And that's a
scary zone for a lot of us.

00:25:08.810 --> 00:25:10.670 align:middle line:84%
A lot of people in this
world would probably

00:25:10.670 --> 00:25:11.470 align:middle line:90%
fall into alchemists.

00:25:11.470 --> 00:25:13.969 align:middle line:84%
>>SMITH: And actually, when I
started to do the sacred money

00:25:13.969 --> 00:25:17.120 align:middle line:84%
archetypes, I met a
lot of alchemists,

00:25:17.120 --> 00:25:20.640 align:middle line:84%
so a lot of people,
particularly in this sort

00:25:20.640 --> 00:25:22.720 align:middle line:84%
of spiritual field,
or people who

00:25:22.720 --> 00:25:25.940 align:middle line:84%
are connecting
with those energies

00:25:25.940 --> 00:25:28.750 align:middle line:90%
and living in that arena.

00:25:28.750 --> 00:25:33.140 align:middle line:84%
The whole financial system
just feels really clunky.

00:25:33.140 --> 00:25:36.940 align:middle line:84%
And often, they were-- if you
think about the alchemists

00:25:36.940 --> 00:25:41.430 align:middle line:84%
traditionally, they were-- they
had the patronage of probably

00:25:41.430 --> 00:25:44.930 align:middle line:84%
royalty or whatever, so they
were always looked after.

00:25:44.930 --> 00:25:47.150 align:middle line:84%
So they can often
end up creating

00:25:47.150 --> 00:25:51.580 align:middle line:84%
financial dependency,
alchemists.

00:25:51.580 --> 00:25:54.440 align:middle line:84%
And the challenge
for the alchemist

00:25:54.440 --> 00:25:57.780 align:middle line:84%
is really to be able to overcome
that love/hate relationship

00:25:57.780 --> 00:26:01.550 align:middle line:84%
with money to-- and
that's again, I think,

00:26:01.550 --> 00:26:04.920 align:middle line:84%
really valuable because the more
alchemists that can do that--

00:26:04.920 --> 00:26:07.620 align:middle line:84%
again, for me, it starts to
change the energy of money.

00:26:07.620 --> 00:26:10.290 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: The entire
landscape, absolutely.

00:26:10.290 --> 00:26:13.530 align:middle line:84%
And you know, when I think
of that, with that-- there

00:26:13.530 --> 00:26:15.750 align:middle line:84%
are certain people
I'm thinking of who

00:26:15.750 --> 00:26:19.340 align:middle line:84%
have that alchemical nature,
including with money.

00:26:19.340 --> 00:26:21.280 align:middle line:84%
I'm going to take
this idea, and I'm

00:26:21.280 --> 00:26:23.660 align:middle line:84%
going to manifest this
and make a living at it.

00:26:23.660 --> 00:26:26.340 align:middle line:84%
But then, because that can
become a little bit challenging

00:26:26.340 --> 00:26:28.610 align:middle line:84%
in this world, might
their second one,

00:26:28.610 --> 00:26:31.050 align:middle line:84%
again, shunt over
to accumulator,

00:26:31.050 --> 00:26:32.620 align:middle line:84%
for example, where
they're running--

00:26:32.620 --> 00:26:34.660 align:middle line:84%
there's also a fear
program running?

00:26:34.660 --> 00:26:38.490 align:middle line:84%
>>SMITH: Yeah, and it's like, if
there is the accumulator there,

00:26:38.490 --> 00:26:40.330 align:middle line:84%
then I think if there's
the accumulator,

00:26:40.330 --> 00:26:43.920 align:middle line:84%
then that would be an
alchemist that had money.

00:26:43.920 --> 00:26:46.370 align:middle line:84%
So they had money,
but they'd be very

00:26:46.370 --> 00:26:51.507 align:middle line:84%
nervous about investing it to
get their idea up and running.

00:26:51.507 --> 00:26:53.340 align:middle line:84%
That would be the pattern
I'd expect to see.

00:26:53.340 --> 00:26:54.710 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So that would
be almost the shadow

00:26:54.710 --> 00:26:55.880 align:middle line:90%
side of the alchemist.

00:26:55.880 --> 00:26:56.620 align:middle line:90%
>>SMITH: Yeah.

00:26:56.620 --> 00:27:01.130 align:middle line:84%
And the thing for the alchemist
is-- for me, it's about saying,

00:27:01.130 --> 00:27:01.940 align:middle line:90%
well, look.

00:27:01.940 --> 00:27:05.580 align:middle line:84%
Actually, it's about overcoming
that love/hate relationship

00:27:05.580 --> 00:27:07.370 align:middle line:84%
because in a sense,
if there's anything--

00:27:07.370 --> 00:27:11.190 align:middle line:84%
what that's showing you is
that there's an aspect probably

00:27:11.190 --> 00:27:13.760 align:middle line:84%
of yourself that you have that
uncomfortable relationship

00:27:13.760 --> 00:27:16.180 align:middle line:90%
with as well.

00:27:16.180 --> 00:27:18.850 align:middle line:84%
And when I work with
people with money,

00:27:18.850 --> 00:27:22.110 align:middle line:84%
I do an exercise which is
about stepping into money,

00:27:22.110 --> 00:27:24.900 align:middle line:84%
a visualization, which
is really powerful.

00:27:24.900 --> 00:27:27.295 align:middle line:84%
And actually, when I put--
you put money in front of you,

00:27:27.295 --> 00:27:29.240 align:middle line:90%
and you literally step into it.

00:27:29.240 --> 00:27:31.970 align:middle line:84%
And it's never what people
think it's going to be.

00:27:31.970 --> 00:27:34.179 align:middle line:84%
What they feel when they
step in is never what they--

00:27:34.179 --> 00:27:35.553 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Have
you recorded that?

00:27:35.553 --> 00:27:36.600 align:middle line:90%
Is that available for us?

00:27:36.600 --> 00:27:38.400 align:middle line:84%
>>SMITH: It's not available
at the moment, actually.

00:27:38.400 --> 00:27:39.983 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Could you
make it available?

00:27:39.983 --> 00:27:41.450 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHTER]

00:27:41.450 --> 00:27:43.100 align:middle line:84%
Maybe you can make
it available online

00:27:43.100 --> 00:27:44.670 align:middle line:84%
for all of our
interested parties.

00:27:44.670 --> 00:27:47.810 align:middle line:84%
>>SMITH: I'll see what I
can do, because also, what I

00:27:47.810 --> 00:27:50.320 align:middle line:84%
find is first of all, it's
never what people think.

00:27:50.320 --> 00:27:53.240 align:middle line:84%
So I had one lady who
had a grandfather who

00:27:53.240 --> 00:27:54.760 align:middle line:90%
was a bank manager.

00:27:54.760 --> 00:27:57.130 align:middle line:84%
She had accumulator
in her top three,

00:27:57.130 --> 00:27:59.370 align:middle line:84%
and she did not want
to look at it at all

00:27:59.370 --> 00:28:01.480 align:middle line:84%
because, to her,
that was boring.

00:28:01.480 --> 00:28:02.250 align:middle line:90%
It was gray.

00:28:02.250 --> 00:28:05.950 align:middle line:84%
It was tedious, like she
felt her grandfather had

00:28:05.950 --> 00:28:08.150 align:middle line:90%
been-- boring bank manager.

00:28:08.150 --> 00:28:11.560 align:middle line:84%
When she stepped into
it, she just went,

00:28:11.560 --> 00:28:15.472 align:middle line:84%
it's just sparkly and
lovely, and it's really--

00:28:15.472 --> 00:28:16.180 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Really?

00:28:16.180 --> 00:28:16.900 align:middle line:90%
That quickly, it shifted?

00:28:16.900 --> 00:28:19.191 align:middle line:84%
>>SMITH: Yeah, and her whole
energy completely shifted.

00:28:19.191 --> 00:28:21.440 align:middle line:84%
And she said it's really
light, and it's fun.

00:28:21.440 --> 00:28:23.650 align:middle line:84%
And we were falling
about laughing at her

00:28:23.650 --> 00:28:26.760 align:middle line:84%
because she just
changed completely.

00:28:26.760 --> 00:28:29.530 align:middle line:84%
And what I find interesting
is when people step in,

00:28:29.530 --> 00:28:33.980 align:middle line:84%
it's usually-- what it reveals
is the aspect of themselves

00:28:33.980 --> 00:28:36.390 align:middle line:84%
that they're not really
expressing at the moment.

00:28:36.390 --> 00:28:37.406 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Interesting.

00:28:37.406 --> 00:28:39.030 align:middle line:84%
Oh, I would love to
do that meditation.

00:28:39.030 --> 00:28:40.310 align:middle line:84%
>>SMITH: Yeah, she
was a fun lady.

00:28:40.310 --> 00:28:42.184 align:middle line:84%
And you could just see
that it's like money's

00:28:42.184 --> 00:28:44.280 align:middle line:90%
going come on, come on, come on.

00:28:44.280 --> 00:28:46.060 align:middle line:84%
There's more--
there's more to you.

00:28:46.060 --> 00:28:47.120 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Engage, engage.

00:28:47.120 --> 00:28:47.859 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

00:28:47.859 --> 00:28:48.358 align:middle line:90%
[SIGH]

00:28:48.358 --> 00:28:48.940 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHTER]

00:28:48.940 --> 00:28:49.440 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:28:49.440 --> 00:28:50.481 align:middle line:90%
What about the connector?

00:28:50.481 --> 00:28:54.670 align:middle line:84%
And you and I both know a lovely
mutual friend, Sandie Sedgbeer.

00:28:54.670 --> 00:28:58.050 align:middle line:84%
Everything about Sandie
has to do with connection,

00:28:58.050 --> 00:29:00.320 align:middle line:84%
whether it's people
or money or whatnot.

00:29:00.320 --> 00:29:03.330 align:middle line:84%
So we would hold her up as
one example of the connector.

00:29:03.330 --> 00:29:06.060 align:middle line:84%
But let's talk about what
the connector actually means.

00:29:06.060 --> 00:29:07.810 align:middle line:84%
>>SMITH: OK, so
connector-- their nickname

00:29:07.810 --> 00:29:13.230 align:middle line:84%
is the inner relationship
creator, which is Sandie.

00:29:13.230 --> 00:29:16.480 align:middle line:84%
Their sacred money contract
is to connect with others,

00:29:16.480 --> 00:29:18.660 align:middle line:90%
is to connect to money.

00:29:18.660 --> 00:29:20.920 align:middle line:84%
So of all the
archetypes, the connector

00:29:20.920 --> 00:29:23.320 align:middle line:84%
has the least
connection to money.

00:29:23.320 --> 00:29:26.340 align:middle line:84%
They often find it
incredibly puzzling.

00:29:26.340 --> 00:29:30.320 align:middle line:90%
They just really can't get it.

00:29:30.320 --> 00:29:32.610 align:middle line:84%
They have a lot of
peace around money.

00:29:32.610 --> 00:29:35.280 align:middle line:84%
One of their gifts is that
they have a lot of faith

00:29:35.280 --> 00:29:39.599 align:middle line:84%
around money and don't feel
anxious often around it.

00:29:39.599 --> 00:29:41.390 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: They don't
understand it, per se,

00:29:41.390 --> 00:29:44.185 align:middle line:84%
but they feel, eh, it'll
come from somewhere.

00:29:44.185 --> 00:29:44.685 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:29:44.685 --> 00:29:46.560 align:middle line:84%
>>SMITH: So they're the
people who will say--

00:29:46.560 --> 00:29:50.670 align:middle line:84%
and that's their experience,
often, that it just shows up.

00:29:50.670 --> 00:29:54.690 align:middle line:84%
So-- but they have a very--
very little connection.

00:29:54.690 --> 00:29:57.190 align:middle line:84%
So good things for
connectors is-- especially

00:29:57.190 --> 00:30:00.940 align:middle line:84%
because money's so virtual
as well-- is to actually

00:30:00.940 --> 00:30:03.820 align:middle line:84%
pay for more in cash, to have
to spend more time actually

00:30:03.820 --> 00:30:08.010 align:middle line:84%
just physically
engaging with the money.

00:30:08.010 --> 00:30:09.580 align:middle line:84%
So the challenge
for connectors is

00:30:09.580 --> 00:30:13.214 align:middle line:84%
that they can end up
financially dependent--

00:30:13.214 --> 00:30:13.880 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Broke.

00:30:13.880 --> 00:30:15.610 align:middle line:84%
>>SMITH: --because they
don't-- no, they're often--

00:30:15.610 --> 00:30:16.890 align:middle line:90%
because it comes through.

00:30:16.890 --> 00:30:18.307 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: It'll
land in their lap.

00:30:18.307 --> 00:30:19.723 align:middle line:10%
>>SMITH: Yeah, and
actually I used

00:30:19.723 --> 00:30:21.680 align:middle line:10%
to find-- I do have
connector as my third one,

00:30:21.680 --> 00:30:24.970 align:middle line:10%
but I used to find it quite
frustrating because it's like,

00:30:24.970 --> 00:30:28.020 align:middle line:10%
I've got ruler and
accumulator at the top two.

00:30:28.020 --> 00:30:30.130 align:middle line:84%
And when you combine
those two, there's

00:30:30.130 --> 00:30:31.860 align:middle line:84%
a lot of fear about
it running out.

00:30:31.860 --> 00:30:34.760 align:middle line:84%
And so when I met connectors
who go, oh, it's all right,

00:30:34.760 --> 00:30:35.760 align:middle line:90%
it comes through.

00:30:35.760 --> 00:30:36.090 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: It'll come anyway.

00:30:36.090 --> 00:30:37.548 align:middle line:84%
>>SMITH: Oh, that
really annoys me.

00:30:37.548 --> 00:30:38.250 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHING]

00:30:38.250 --> 00:30:40.680 align:middle line:84%
And that was their experience,
that it would come through.

00:30:40.680 --> 00:30:42.150 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And it does
come through, doesn't it?

00:30:42.150 --> 00:30:42.858 align:middle line:90%
>>SMITH: It does.

00:30:42.858 --> 00:30:46.330 align:middle line:84%
It does, but it's sort of-- and
it's actually saying-- well,

00:30:46.330 --> 00:30:48.810 align:middle line:84%
that's why it's saying to
connect to money-- to connect

00:30:48.810 --> 00:30:50.220 align:middle line:84%
to others is to
connect to money.

00:30:50.220 --> 00:30:54.430 align:middle line:84%
So it's like saying, actually,
if you connect to money,

00:30:54.430 --> 00:30:57.960 align:middle line:84%
it's almost as though your
connection expands even more.

00:30:57.960 --> 00:31:00.250 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Well, there
are often people

00:31:00.250 --> 00:31:04.680 align:middle line:84%
who are-- their main currency
is their relationships

00:31:04.680 --> 00:31:06.570 align:middle line:90%
with other people, right?

00:31:06.570 --> 00:31:10.070 align:middle line:84%
And so money comes as a result
of touching other people,

00:31:10.070 --> 00:31:11.950 align:middle line:84%
touching people
with other people.

00:31:11.950 --> 00:31:12.870 align:middle line:90%
>>SMITH: Yeah.

00:31:12.870 --> 00:31:14.640 align:middle line:84%
So then it's saying,
well, actually,

00:31:14.640 --> 00:31:17.030 align:middle line:84%
if you were to connect to
money, how many more people

00:31:17.030 --> 00:31:18.300 align:middle line:90%
could you touch?

00:31:18.300 --> 00:31:19.070 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:31:19.070 --> 00:31:20.360 align:middle line:90%
>>SMITH: Yeah.

00:31:20.360 --> 00:31:22.440 align:middle line:84%
And often I find
with connectors--

00:31:22.440 --> 00:31:25.747 align:middle line:84%
one of the things that can
happen to them is that they're

00:31:25.747 --> 00:31:28.170 align:middle line:84%
so busy trying to
connect, they actually

00:31:28.170 --> 00:31:32.100 align:middle line:84%
can become quite
difficult to connect to.

00:31:32.100 --> 00:31:35.090 align:middle line:84%
They're always seeking
that connection.

00:31:35.090 --> 00:31:37.480 align:middle line:84%
And so really,
again, it's almost as

00:31:37.480 --> 00:31:39.670 align:middle line:84%
though there's an
internal connection that's

00:31:39.670 --> 00:31:43.090 align:middle line:90%
not quite there.

00:31:43.090 --> 00:31:47.400 align:middle line:84%
And often, by engaging
with the money--

00:31:47.400 --> 00:31:49.480 align:middle line:84%
because it's something
they're so disconnected

00:31:49.480 --> 00:31:51.540 align:middle line:84%
to-- it's like
going, this is just

00:31:51.540 --> 00:31:53.864 align:middle line:84%
a new chance to
make a new friend.

00:31:53.864 --> 00:31:55.744 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHTER]

00:31:55.744 --> 00:31:57.660 align:middle line:84%
And how you do money is
how you do everything.

00:31:57.660 --> 00:32:02.042 align:middle line:84%
So this is a new
friend called money.

00:32:02.042 --> 00:32:03.500 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: OK, now
next, we're going

00:32:03.500 --> 00:32:05.250 align:middle line:90%
to talk about the romantic.

00:32:05.250 --> 00:32:06.900 align:middle line:90%
>>SMITH: Oh, the romantic, yes.

00:32:06.900 --> 00:32:10.670 align:middle line:10%
The romantic is
the inner hedonist,

00:32:10.670 --> 00:32:14.880 align:middle line:10%
which-- I think hedonist has
got a bit of a bad rap, really.

00:32:14.880 --> 00:32:18.970 align:middle line:84%
And romantics just
love the fine things.

00:32:18.970 --> 00:32:24.880 align:middle line:10%
So their sacred money contract
is to create financial security

00:32:24.880 --> 00:32:26.520 align:middle line:10%
while living life
to its fullest.

00:32:26.520 --> 00:32:29.270 align:middle line:84%
So they have no problem in
living life to its fullest.

00:32:29.270 --> 00:32:32.020 align:middle line:84%
It's creating the
financial security.

00:32:32.020 --> 00:32:35.580 align:middle line:10%
And what romantics
are all about--

00:32:35.580 --> 00:32:39.470 align:middle line:10%
they love really-- they're
real aesthetics, you know?

00:32:39.470 --> 00:32:42.190 align:middle line:10%
They love-- they really
appreciate beauty.

00:32:42.190 --> 00:32:46.270 align:middle line:10%
They appreciate all
the really fine things

00:32:46.270 --> 00:32:49.150 align:middle line:10%
and have a great appreciation
for that and also

00:32:49.150 --> 00:32:52.027 align:middle line:10%
then are a great support
for people whose passion it

00:32:52.027 --> 00:32:55.450 align:middle line:10%
is to create those things.

00:32:55.450 --> 00:32:58.265 align:middle line:84%
So it always makes me smile
because the romantics-- one

00:32:58.265 --> 00:33:00.030 align:middle line:84%
of their gifts is
supporting the economy.

00:33:00.030 --> 00:33:01.350 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHTER]

00:33:01.350 --> 00:33:02.352 align:middle line:90%
They're the spenders.

00:33:02.352 --> 00:33:04.560 align:middle line:84%
They're the ones that will
go out there and spend it.

00:33:04.560 --> 00:33:06.770 align:middle line:84%
They're very generous, and
again have a lot of faith

00:33:06.770 --> 00:33:07.990 align:middle line:90%
around money.

00:33:07.990 --> 00:33:11.320 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So might they
also be a lot of the support

00:33:11.320 --> 00:33:12.600 align:middle line:90%
and charity and so forth?

00:33:12.600 --> 00:33:16.650 align:middle line:10%
>>SMITH: Yeah, but
particularly like our artists,

00:33:16.650 --> 00:33:19.390 align:middle line:10%
or they're the people who will
spend money on the really fine

00:33:19.390 --> 00:33:19.890 align:middle line:10%
food--

00:33:19.890 --> 00:33:21.050 align:middle line:10%
>>REGINA: On beautiful art and--

00:33:21.050 --> 00:33:22.383 align:middle line:10%
>>SMITH: --or the beautiful art.

00:33:22.383 --> 00:33:24.260 align:middle line:90%
And they support the artists.

00:33:24.260 --> 00:33:27.320 align:middle line:90%
That's what they're doing.

00:33:27.320 --> 00:33:30.924 align:middle line:84%
I think romantics are all about
bringing beauty to the planet,

00:33:30.924 --> 00:33:32.090 align:middle line:90%
and I think they're really--

00:33:32.090 --> 00:33:33.360 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Totally necessary.

00:33:33.360 --> 00:33:34.200 align:middle line:90%
>>SMITH: Yeah.

00:33:34.200 --> 00:33:37.220 align:middle line:84%
So at the higher expression,
that's what they are.

00:33:37.220 --> 00:33:40.155 align:middle line:84%
The lower expression, possibly
the glutton-- you know,

00:33:40.155 --> 00:33:42.250 align:middle line:84%
it's like more, more,
more, always wanting more.

00:33:42.250 --> 00:33:47.850 align:middle line:10%
And that's often where there's
that buying to fill a hole--

00:33:47.850 --> 00:33:49.680 align:middle line:10%
>>REGINA: Inside their
own psyche or heart.

00:33:49.680 --> 00:33:51.030 align:middle line:90%
>>SMITH: Yeah.

00:33:51.030 --> 00:33:51.850 align:middle line:90%
But I--

00:33:51.850 --> 00:33:55.140 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: But you can't buy
enough handbags and pieces

00:33:55.140 --> 00:33:56.020 align:middle line:90%
of art to fill it.

00:33:56.020 --> 00:33:58.353 align:middle line:84%
>>SMITH: And that's when I
think it becomes interesting,

00:33:58.353 --> 00:34:00.390 align:middle line:84%
because it's like,
what's driving that?

00:34:00.390 --> 00:34:01.990 align:middle line:90%
What's behind that purchase?

00:34:01.990 --> 00:34:03.540 align:middle line:90%
Is it oh, yes!

00:34:03.540 --> 00:34:04.460 align:middle line:90%
Or is it--

00:34:04.460 --> 00:34:05.460 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Gotta have it.

00:34:05.460 --> 00:34:06.560 align:middle line:90%
>>SMITH: Yeah.

00:34:06.560 --> 00:34:10.539 align:middle line:84%
And that's that lower and higher
expression of the romantic.

00:34:10.539 --> 00:34:11.080 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: OK.

00:34:11.080 --> 00:34:12.790 align:middle line:90%
What about the celebrity?

00:34:12.790 --> 00:34:17.620 align:middle line:10%
>>SMITH: The celebrity-- OK, the
celebrity's the inner big shot,

00:34:17.620 --> 00:34:21.719 align:middle line:10%
and their sacred money contract
is to accumulate wealth

00:34:21.719 --> 00:34:24.120 align:middle line:10%
while being admired and
valued in the world.

00:34:24.120 --> 00:34:26.909 align:middle line:84%
So the admired and valued
in the world, no problem--

00:34:26.909 --> 00:34:29.500 align:middle line:84%
accumulating wealth,
a bit more tricky.

00:34:29.500 --> 00:34:34.429 align:middle line:10%
So what they love is they
are-- they're sort of-- they

00:34:34.429 --> 00:34:38.030 align:middle line:10%
want to be in the
spotlight, the celebrities.

00:34:38.030 --> 00:34:39.610 align:middle line:10%
And so what they're
very good at is

00:34:39.610 --> 00:34:41.735 align:middle line:10%
they will help other people
to be in the spotlight,

00:34:41.735 --> 00:34:44.830 align:middle line:10%
so they're often
real leaders as well.

00:34:44.830 --> 00:34:46.580 align:middle line:90%
And they just like to shine.

00:34:46.580 --> 00:34:48.870 align:middle line:90%
They are the stars.

00:34:48.870 --> 00:34:50.980 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And how does
that relate to money?

00:34:50.980 --> 00:34:52.610 align:middle line:84%
>>SMITH: Well, the
thing with the money

00:34:52.610 --> 00:34:57.800 align:middle line:84%
is that they can often end up
spending very compulsively.

00:34:57.800 --> 00:34:59.590 align:middle line:90%
They like the bling.

00:34:59.590 --> 00:35:03.820 align:middle line:84%
They like the-- they'll buy
a designer label because it's

00:35:03.820 --> 00:35:06.640 align:middle line:84%
a designer label, whereas
the romantic will buy it

00:35:06.640 --> 00:35:09.200 align:middle line:84%
because it's handmade
and it's beautiful.

00:35:09.200 --> 00:35:12.540 align:middle line:84%
So they will buy it because
it's Versace or whatever.

00:35:12.540 --> 00:35:14.290 align:middle line:90%
It's got a particular look.

00:35:14.290 --> 00:35:16.770 align:middle line:10%
So they are the show people.

00:35:16.770 --> 00:35:20.149 align:middle line:84%
They're the people who--
so it's then whether or not

00:35:20.149 --> 00:35:22.690 align:middle line:84%
what they're doing is aligned,
whether they're at that higher

00:35:22.690 --> 00:35:24.780 align:middle line:84%
expression or that
lower expression.

00:35:24.780 --> 00:35:28.020 align:middle line:84%
So at the higher expression,
they not only shine,

00:35:28.020 --> 00:35:30.060 align:middle line:84%
but they shine light
on other people.

00:35:30.060 --> 00:35:32.320 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And the
lower expression, they

00:35:32.320 --> 00:35:34.210 align:middle line:90%
can be spendthrifts, you say?

00:35:34.210 --> 00:35:35.280 align:middle line:90%
>>SMITH: Yeah.

00:35:35.280 --> 00:35:36.140 align:middle line:90%
They can be very--

00:35:36.140 --> 00:35:38.090 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Run themselves
into financial ruination--

00:35:38.090 --> 00:35:38.242 align:middle line:90%
>>SMITH: Yeah.

00:35:38.242 --> 00:35:38.741 align:middle line:90%
And often--

00:35:38.741 --> 00:35:40.410 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: --over
acquisitions and such?

00:35:40.410 --> 00:35:42.576 align:middle line:84%
>>SMITH: And have a mismatch
between the public face

00:35:42.576 --> 00:35:43.890 align:middle line:90%
and the private face.

00:35:43.890 --> 00:35:47.860 align:middle line:84%
It can just be all show,
keeping up appearances.

00:35:47.860 --> 00:35:50.890 align:middle line:84%
But actually, they've
got a fantastic handbag,

00:35:50.890 --> 00:35:54.120 align:middle line:84%
but they're eating--
they can't afford

00:35:54.120 --> 00:35:56.290 align:middle line:84%
to eat proper food,
that sort of thing.

00:35:56.290 --> 00:35:58.100 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: What
about the nurturer?

00:35:58.100 --> 00:36:02.170 align:middle line:84%
>>SMITH: The nurturer
is the inner sponsor,

00:36:02.170 --> 00:36:05.250 align:middle line:84%
and the sacred money
contract is to care

00:36:05.250 --> 00:36:07.820 align:middle line:84%
for others by
empowering oneself.

00:36:07.820 --> 00:36:13.060 align:middle line:84%
So nurturers, again-- caring for
others is what comes naturally.

00:36:13.060 --> 00:36:14.930 align:middle line:84%
They give, give,
give, give, give,

00:36:14.930 --> 00:36:18.240 align:middle line:84%
but they can often not
receive, receive, receive.

00:36:18.240 --> 00:36:19.420 align:middle line:90%
So they become the martyrs.

00:36:19.420 --> 00:36:20.610 align:middle line:90%
They can become the martyrs.

00:36:20.610 --> 00:36:22.681 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Can they
become the enablers?

00:36:22.681 --> 00:36:23.430 align:middle line:10%
>>SMITH: They can.

00:36:23.430 --> 00:36:26.690 align:middle line:10%
That's when they get it--
especially financially,

00:36:26.690 --> 00:36:28.940 align:middle line:10%
that's the key for the
nurturer, to become

00:36:28.940 --> 00:36:31.340 align:middle line:10%
an enabler, rather
than a rescuer.

00:36:31.340 --> 00:36:32.790 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: OK, interesting.

00:36:32.790 --> 00:36:35.810 align:middle line:84%
>>SMITH: So nurturers are
often very good financially.

00:36:35.810 --> 00:36:38.450 align:middle line:10%
They are very
competent, but they

00:36:38.450 --> 00:36:42.620 align:middle line:10%
can end up getting in
debt to help other people.

00:36:42.620 --> 00:36:47.410 align:middle line:10%
So they become the enabler when
they-- that's the key for them,

00:36:47.410 --> 00:36:51.890 align:middle line:10%
is to empower other people,
rather than to race in

00:36:51.890 --> 00:36:53.990 align:middle line:10%
to rescue them.

00:36:53.990 --> 00:36:57.014 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: OK, and the final
one is the maverick, I believe.

00:36:57.014 --> 00:36:58.180 align:middle line:90%
Do we-- have we covered all?

00:36:58.180 --> 00:36:59.320 align:middle line:90%
Yes, the maverick.

00:36:59.320 --> 00:36:59.903 align:middle line:90%
>>SMITH: Yeah.

00:36:59.903 --> 00:37:03.820 align:middle line:84%
The maverick is the
inner rebel with a cause.

00:37:03.820 --> 00:37:06.930 align:middle line:84%
So their sacred
money contract is

00:37:06.930 --> 00:37:10.890 align:middle line:84%
to balance extreme risk
with financial security.

00:37:10.890 --> 00:37:13.980 align:middle line:10%
So they're the gamblers.

00:37:13.980 --> 00:37:16.860 align:middle line:90%
They like the big wins.

00:37:16.860 --> 00:37:22.310 align:middle line:84%
And their challenge is to
do the slow, steady stuff.

00:37:22.310 --> 00:37:25.520 align:middle line:84%
And it's quite interesting
because Bill Aley, my business

00:37:25.520 --> 00:37:28.240 align:middle line:84%
partner, he's a maverick,
and I'm a ruler.

00:37:28.240 --> 00:37:30.260 align:middle line:84%
So sometimes, it feels
like I'll build it up,

00:37:30.260 --> 00:37:33.470 align:middle line:84%
and then he'll come in
and turn the tables over.

00:37:33.470 --> 00:37:35.742 align:middle line:84%
But he was a bond dealer
before, so mavericks--

00:37:35.742 --> 00:37:37.700 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Oh, and there's
gambling there, even.

00:37:37.700 --> 00:37:37.812 align:middle line:90%
>>SMITH: Yeah.

00:37:37.812 --> 00:37:39.228 align:middle line:84%
Well, they have a
very-- mavericks

00:37:39.228 --> 00:37:41.910 align:middle line:84%
have a very good
connection to price.

00:37:41.910 --> 00:37:44.070 align:middle line:84%
They have that
real innate knowing

00:37:44.070 --> 00:37:47.490 align:middle line:84%
of how something
should be priced,

00:37:47.490 --> 00:37:50.300 align:middle line:84%
and they're very good
at financial complexity,

00:37:50.300 --> 00:37:51.800 align:middle line:90%
dealing with money.

00:37:51.800 --> 00:37:54.720 align:middle line:90%
They're very financially savvy.

00:37:54.720 --> 00:37:59.510 align:middle line:84%
And the challenge is to really
do the steady, slow stuff,

00:37:59.510 --> 00:38:01.260 align:middle line:84%
because they get
really bored with that.

00:38:01.260 --> 00:38:03.080 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Really
bored easily-- OK,

00:38:03.080 --> 00:38:04.900 align:middle line:84%
so we've talked about
these, and we're

00:38:04.900 --> 00:38:07.750 align:middle line:84%
looking at-- you have one
dominant one and usually one

00:38:07.750 --> 00:38:10.363 align:middle line:84%
or two secondary ones that
show you the potential, right?

00:38:10.363 --> 00:38:10.946 align:middle line:90%
>>SMITH: Yeah.

00:38:10.946 --> 00:38:13.160 align:middle line:84%
So when you do the
assessment, you rank them.

00:38:13.160 --> 00:38:15.070 align:middle line:84%
And then, you're
looking for the top one,

00:38:15.070 --> 00:38:17.056 align:middle line:84%
and then you're looking
for your number two

00:38:17.056 --> 00:38:18.830 align:middle line:90%
and your number three.

00:38:18.830 --> 00:38:21.870 align:middle line:84%
And the way it works is
the primary archetype

00:38:21.870 --> 00:38:23.310 align:middle line:90%
will be your top one.

00:38:23.310 --> 00:38:25.030 align:middle line:84%
And then the second
two, what they

00:38:25.030 --> 00:38:27.470 align:middle line:84%
do is they expand
what's possible.

00:38:27.470 --> 00:38:29.980 align:middle line:84%
So sometimes, that's
by-- if you look

00:38:29.980 --> 00:38:32.260 align:middle line:84%
at the gifts of
the other two, they

00:38:32.260 --> 00:38:34.630 align:middle line:84%
will enhance the
gifts of the top one.

00:38:34.630 --> 00:38:36.620 align:middle line:84%
So connectors have a lot
of faith around money.

00:38:36.620 --> 00:38:38.000 align:middle line:90%
So do romantics.

00:38:38.000 --> 00:38:40.960 align:middle line:90%
So that would enhance that.

00:38:40.960 --> 00:38:44.070 align:middle line:84%
Sometimes, they actually
overcome the challenges

00:38:44.070 --> 00:38:44.980 align:middle line:90%
at the top.

00:38:44.980 --> 00:38:48.580 align:middle line:84%
So I have connector in my
third one, ruler at the top.

00:38:48.580 --> 00:38:50.410 align:middle line:90%
Connectors-- faith in money.

00:38:50.410 --> 00:38:52.475 align:middle line:90%
Rulers-- anxiety.

00:38:52.475 --> 00:38:53.350 align:middle line:90%
So that allows that--

00:38:53.350 --> 00:38:54.100 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Kind of softens it.

00:38:54.100 --> 00:38:56.020 align:middle line:84%
>>SMITH: Softens it--
and sometimes, it just

00:38:56.020 --> 00:38:58.290 align:middle line:84%
exacerbates the challenges
because it means you really

00:38:58.290 --> 00:39:00.090 align:middle line:90%
are going to have to look at it.

00:39:00.090 --> 00:39:01.835 align:middle line:84%
So what they do
is-- and I see it

00:39:01.835 --> 00:39:03.380 align:middle line:84%
as being like a
three-legged stool.

00:39:03.380 --> 00:39:05.310 align:middle line:84%
And there are three,
and often you'll

00:39:05.310 --> 00:39:08.950 align:middle line:84%
find that people will resist--
may not be really expressing

00:39:08.950 --> 00:39:11.000 align:middle line:90%
one of them.

00:39:11.000 --> 00:39:13.325 align:middle line:84%
So I always tease Sandie
because Sandie has romantic--

00:39:13.325 --> 00:39:14.950 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Yes, she
does, and connector.

00:39:14.950 --> 00:39:17.400 align:middle line:84%
>>SMITH: And I will say, come
on, where's the romantic?

00:39:17.400 --> 00:39:18.165 align:middle line:90%
So that is that.

00:39:18.165 --> 00:39:19.290 align:middle line:90%
So that's the way it works.

00:39:19.290 --> 00:39:20.840 align:middle line:84%
And then, there's
also the bottom one.

00:39:20.840 --> 00:39:22.580 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And that's what
I wanted to bring up next.

00:39:22.580 --> 00:39:25.250 align:middle line:84%
So let's talk about the bottom
one, what you absolutely

00:39:25.250 --> 00:39:25.860 align:middle line:90%
are not.

00:39:25.860 --> 00:39:28.190 align:middle line:84%
And that has to be
some aspect of our self

00:39:28.190 --> 00:39:31.277 align:middle line:84%
we're rejecting, having a
hard time connecting with.

00:39:31.277 --> 00:39:31.860 align:middle line:90%
>>SMITH: Yeah.

00:39:31.860 --> 00:39:36.190 align:middle line:10%
So my bottom one is
celebrity, and it

00:39:36.190 --> 00:39:38.260 align:middle line:10%
made an awful lot
of sense when I

00:39:38.260 --> 00:39:40.280 align:middle line:10%
saw that because it
was like, actually,

00:39:40.280 --> 00:39:43.440 align:middle line:10%
I really don't want to do that.

00:39:43.440 --> 00:39:47.020 align:middle line:84%
And Sandie teased-- I remember
when I did her "Virtual Light"

00:39:47.020 --> 00:39:51.020 align:middle line:84%
broadcast, and she said,
do you want to come on?

00:39:51.020 --> 00:39:51.590 align:middle line:90%
I said no.

00:39:51.590 --> 00:39:52.340 align:middle line:90%
She said, why not?

00:39:52.340 --> 00:39:56.740 align:middle line:10%
I said celebrity is
my bottom archetype.

00:39:56.740 --> 00:39:59.360 align:middle line:10%
But the way it works
is it's also, then,

00:39:59.360 --> 00:40:02.449 align:middle line:10%
the real opportunity for
growth because it's like,

00:40:02.449 --> 00:40:04.240 align:middle line:10%
well, what's going on
with that bottom one?

00:40:04.240 --> 00:40:07.640 align:middle line:84%
It's not that you're
ever going to be that.

00:40:07.640 --> 00:40:10.460 align:middle line:84%
And so part of what
happens is when

00:40:10.460 --> 00:40:13.200 align:middle line:84%
people do their archetypes,
they can sort of

00:40:13.200 --> 00:40:16.200 align:middle line:90%
relax and go, oh, right, OK.

00:40:16.200 --> 00:40:18.370 align:middle line:84%
So it was me going, no,
I'm not a celebrity.

00:40:18.370 --> 00:40:20.689 align:middle line:10%
Money is not going
to flow to me.

00:40:20.689 --> 00:40:22.230 align:middle line:10%
I'm not going to be
a full expression

00:40:22.230 --> 00:40:23.650 align:middle line:10%
by being a celebrity.

00:40:23.650 --> 00:40:28.180 align:middle line:10%
But I can also look at what
my resistance is there to it

00:40:28.180 --> 00:40:31.830 align:middle line:10%
and-- because once you've
lost the resistance to it,

00:40:31.830 --> 00:40:35.480 align:middle line:10%
then it can then
really add to the mix.

00:40:35.480 --> 00:40:39.640 align:middle line:84%
So it's usually part of--
often, there's a family money

00:40:39.640 --> 00:40:42.107 align:middle line:84%
story, some family
thing going on there,

00:40:42.107 --> 00:40:43.565 align:middle line:84%
but it is usually
a bit of yourself

00:40:43.565 --> 00:40:45.720 align:middle line:84%
that you're sort of going,
oh, I'm not going there.

00:40:45.720 --> 00:40:46.845 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: You're rejecting.

00:40:46.845 --> 00:40:48.810 align:middle line:10%
>>SMITH: So it's not
about ever becoming it.

00:40:48.810 --> 00:40:52.090 align:middle line:84%
So we had another client
who was running a business

00:40:52.090 --> 00:40:55.060 align:middle line:84%
as a martial arts
schools, and he

00:40:55.060 --> 00:40:57.940 align:middle line:84%
was building a number
of different schools.

00:40:57.940 --> 00:41:00.420 align:middle line:84%
And we looked at it,
and I said, you know,

00:41:00.420 --> 00:41:02.700 align:middle line:90%
ruler's right at the bottom.

00:41:02.700 --> 00:41:04.180 align:middle line:90%
That's your bottom archetype.

00:41:04.180 --> 00:41:06.260 align:middle line:84%
And you could feel that
he was putting himself

00:41:06.260 --> 00:41:10.290 align:middle line:84%
on this path of when I've
done this-- feeling he had

00:41:10.290 --> 00:41:13.390 align:middle line:84%
to do that in order to be
successful-- it's just stepping

00:41:13.390 --> 00:41:15.960 align:middle line:84%
back from it, going
look, you're not a ruler.

00:41:15.960 --> 00:41:18.800 align:middle line:84%
Actually, what you have
is you have nurturer.

00:41:18.800 --> 00:41:22.002 align:middle line:84%
You have celebrity,
and you have alchemist.

00:41:22.002 --> 00:41:25.960 align:middle line:10%
Now, let's work with those
and see what happens.

00:41:25.960 --> 00:41:30.240 align:middle line:10%
If, as the alchemist,
that's part of the vision,

00:41:30.240 --> 00:41:31.800 align:middle line:10%
then you need to
find other people

00:41:31.800 --> 00:41:35.990 align:middle line:10%
to come in to do the bits of
the business that you can't do.

00:41:35.990 --> 00:41:37.472 align:middle line:84%
But it's not about--
for him, it's

00:41:37.472 --> 00:41:38.680 align:middle line:90%
not about building an empire.

00:41:38.680 --> 00:41:40.640 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Because if you ignore
the parts that aren't working,

00:41:40.640 --> 00:41:42.560 align:middle line:84%
then your business goes
down anyway, right?

00:41:42.560 --> 00:41:44.860 align:middle line:84%
>>SMITH: And it was
struggling, yeah.

00:41:44.860 --> 00:41:49.170 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And do people often
have embarrassment or shame

00:41:49.170 --> 00:41:52.900 align:middle line:84%
around their money type, once
they find out what it is?

00:41:52.900 --> 00:41:55.250 align:middle line:10%
>>SMITH: Sometimes,
one thing-- often,

00:41:55.250 --> 00:41:58.240 align:middle line:10%
people will just go, oh,
yeah, that makes sense,

00:41:58.240 --> 00:42:00.476 align:middle line:10%
because what this
is about is this

00:42:00.476 --> 00:42:03.330 align:middle line:10%
is the inherent pattern of
power for money with you.

00:42:03.330 --> 00:42:05.127 align:middle line:84%
And often, people
go, oh, you mean

00:42:05.127 --> 00:42:07.460 align:middle line:84%
I don't have to do all
those things anymore?

00:42:07.460 --> 00:42:10.430 align:middle line:84%
So it is like meeting
yourself and going,

00:42:10.430 --> 00:42:12.400 align:middle line:84%
you can be that,
because it's saying

00:42:12.400 --> 00:42:14.550 align:middle line:84%
you don't have to pretend
to be all these things.

00:42:14.550 --> 00:42:16.605 align:middle line:84%
And often, the bottom
one is the thing

00:42:16.605 --> 00:42:19.790 align:middle line:84%
that you think you have to
do in order to be successful,

00:42:19.790 --> 00:42:22.040 align:middle line:84%
so it's being able to
go, don't resist it,

00:42:22.040 --> 00:42:24.950 align:middle line:90%
but you don't have to be that.

00:42:24.950 --> 00:42:28.209 align:middle line:84%
Sometimes, people will
go, I don't like that one.

00:42:28.209 --> 00:42:29.750 align:middle line:84%
People often have
a lot of resistance

00:42:29.750 --> 00:42:33.100 align:middle line:84%
to being nurturers because they
think they'll never make money

00:42:33.100 --> 00:42:37.830 align:middle line:84%
being a nurturer because it's
about looking after people.

00:42:37.830 --> 00:42:42.352 align:middle line:84%
And people often have reluctance
around the accumulator.

00:42:42.352 --> 00:42:44.810 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Because you think
you're greedy, selfish, boring,

00:42:44.810 --> 00:42:45.200 align:middle line:90%
whatever.

00:42:45.200 --> 00:42:46.190 align:middle line:90%
>>SMITH: Boring, yeah.

00:42:46.190 --> 00:42:47.820 align:middle line:84%
So sometimes-- and
then, it will often

00:42:47.820 --> 00:42:51.070 align:middle line:84%
show up when people
step into the space

00:42:51.070 --> 00:42:52.290 align:middle line:90%
between the archetypes.

00:42:52.290 --> 00:42:55.320 align:middle line:84%
You can-- what I do is get
them to put pieces of paper

00:42:55.320 --> 00:42:58.160 align:middle line:84%
down and stand with the
three archetypes on,

00:42:58.160 --> 00:43:00.461 align:middle line:84%
stand in the middle, and
just see how that feels.

00:43:00.461 --> 00:43:02.710 align:middle line:84%
And often, you'll just watch
people go, oh, yeah, that

00:43:02.710 --> 00:43:04.090 align:middle line:90%
feels really good.

00:43:04.090 --> 00:43:05.740 align:middle line:84%
Or they'll go--
you can just see,

00:43:05.740 --> 00:43:08.370 align:middle line:84%
they'll physically
move towards one.

00:43:08.370 --> 00:43:11.264 align:middle line:84%
OK, what's the
story with this one?

00:43:11.264 --> 00:43:13.180 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Well, let's
talk about relationships

00:43:13.180 --> 00:43:16.160 align:middle line:84%
now because that's where
this intimate relationship

00:43:16.160 --> 00:43:19.720 align:middle line:84%
with money often falls down,
is in our relationships

00:43:19.720 --> 00:43:22.490 align:middle line:84%
with others and how we
perceive money and utilize it.

00:43:22.490 --> 00:43:24.940 align:middle line:84%
So give us some
examples of, say,

00:43:24.940 --> 00:43:28.200 align:middle line:84%
a couple of couples, one
that is really well matched

00:43:28.200 --> 00:43:30.820 align:middle line:84%
on the archetype level and
a couple that would not

00:43:30.820 --> 00:43:33.180 align:middle line:84%
be very well matched and
might need some outside help,

00:43:33.180 --> 00:43:36.340 align:middle line:90%
or even end up divorced.

00:43:36.340 --> 00:43:39.580 align:middle line:10%
>>SMITH: I think
the one-- I suppose

00:43:39.580 --> 00:43:41.980 align:middle line:10%
I've had people with
both situations.

00:43:41.980 --> 00:43:45.480 align:middle line:84%
One couple I saw
was where you have

00:43:45.480 --> 00:43:48.900 align:middle line:84%
the connector and
the accumulator,

00:43:48.900 --> 00:43:56.570 align:middle line:84%
and that can work very well
because the connector will--

00:43:56.570 --> 00:44:00.660 align:middle line:84%
the accumulator provides
the base for the connector,

00:44:00.660 --> 00:44:02.750 align:middle line:84%
and then the connector
provides the connection

00:44:02.750 --> 00:44:04.170 align:middle line:90%
for the accumulator.

00:44:04.170 --> 00:44:06.580 align:middle line:84%
So together, they
actually complement

00:44:06.580 --> 00:44:09.600 align:middle line:90%
one another really well.

00:44:09.600 --> 00:44:11.320 align:middle line:90%
So that works.

00:44:11.320 --> 00:44:12.770 align:middle line:90%
That can work.

00:44:12.770 --> 00:44:14.470 align:middle line:90%
They can all work.

00:44:14.470 --> 00:44:19.040 align:middle line:84%
The challenge is almost, I feel,
going forward, is to avoid co--

00:44:19.040 --> 00:44:20.717 align:middle line:84%
is to getting out
of co-dependency.

00:44:20.717 --> 00:44:22.050 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes, I can understand.

00:44:22.050 --> 00:44:24.650 align:middle line:84%
I mean, there are some
larger themes at play here.

00:44:24.650 --> 00:44:26.860 align:middle line:84%
But just looking-- if
we're walking around,

00:44:26.860 --> 00:44:32.540 align:middle line:84%
not all that conscious or aware
of these kinds of archetypes,

00:44:32.540 --> 00:44:35.170 align:middle line:84%
and-- what are the-- what
would the trap, for example,

00:44:35.170 --> 00:44:38.050 align:middle line:84%
be of a couple that you've seen,
where they've both fallen into,

00:44:38.050 --> 00:44:42.440 align:middle line:84%
and something larger is not
being generated or addressed?

00:44:42.440 --> 00:44:44.150 align:middle line:84%
>>SMITH: One of
the things that I

00:44:44.150 --> 00:44:47.370 align:middle line:84%
saw was where we had
actually two nurturers.

00:44:47.370 --> 00:44:50.500 align:middle line:84%
So they both had to--
they were both nurturers,

00:44:50.500 --> 00:44:53.600 align:middle line:84%
so you could see why they'd
been attracted to one another.

00:44:53.600 --> 00:44:55.650 align:middle line:84%
So they both have
very similar attitudes

00:44:55.650 --> 00:44:58.500 align:middle line:84%
to money, which you would
think would be quite good.

00:44:58.500 --> 00:44:59.890 align:middle line:84%
But then, what
you had to look at

00:44:59.890 --> 00:45:02.760 align:middle line:84%
was, well, they were actually
very different nurturers.

00:45:02.760 --> 00:45:07.910 align:middle line:84%
So one had this-- I think one
had alchemist and celebrity,

00:45:07.910 --> 00:45:09.890 align:middle line:84%
and another had
maverick and romantic.

00:45:09.890 --> 00:45:15.140 align:middle line:84%
So you go, actually, they're
two very different nurturers.

00:45:15.140 --> 00:45:18.340 align:middle line:10%
And actually, when we set
out the archetypes for them,

00:45:18.340 --> 00:45:21.910 align:middle line:10%
you could say-- you could
go, oh, well, actually,

00:45:21.910 --> 00:45:24.500 align:middle line:10%
that makes a lot of sense
because you could feel

00:45:24.500 --> 00:45:28.610 align:middle line:10%
he would get frustrated
by her being what he felt

00:45:28.610 --> 00:45:34.200 align:middle line:10%
was sort of frivolous spending
on beautiful, beautiful things.

00:45:34.200 --> 00:45:35.875 align:middle line:84%
And she could feel
with the maverick

00:45:35.875 --> 00:45:39.170 align:middle line:84%
was he was being a bit
stuffy about this-- the way

00:45:39.170 --> 00:45:41.960 align:middle line:84%
he was with all things,
but couldn't understand

00:45:41.960 --> 00:45:44.920 align:middle line:84%
why celebrity-- why he-- it
was really important for him--

00:45:44.920 --> 00:45:52.580 align:middle line:84%
he had a particular uniform-type
clothes that he would wear.

00:45:52.580 --> 00:45:55.430 align:middle line:84%
So both-- when they-- you
can have two people who

00:45:55.430 --> 00:45:57.030 align:middle line:84%
come together have
the same archetype,

00:45:57.030 --> 00:45:59.074 align:middle line:90%
which can have problems.

00:45:59.074 --> 00:46:00.490 align:middle line:84%
The other thing
I've seen is where

00:46:00.490 --> 00:46:03.860 align:middle line:84%
you have husband and
wives running businesses,

00:46:03.860 --> 00:46:05.890 align:middle line:90%
or partners running businesses.

00:46:05.890 --> 00:46:08.930 align:middle line:84%
And I know there was one
couple I came across,

00:46:08.930 --> 00:46:13.460 align:middle line:84%
and I remember sort of saying
neither of them had connector

00:46:13.460 --> 00:46:16.430 align:middle line:84%
at all, and it was like,
well-- and I think nurturing.

00:46:16.430 --> 00:46:19.080 align:middle line:84%
It was like, well, who
deals with the staff?

00:46:19.080 --> 00:46:21.165 align:middle line:84%
And they just laughed
and went, yeah.

00:46:21.165 --> 00:46:22.100 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHTER]

00:46:22.100 --> 00:46:24.950 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: No one
deals with the staff.

00:46:24.950 --> 00:46:27.810 align:middle line:10%
>>SMITH: And then it was
like, well, accumulator

00:46:27.810 --> 00:46:29.560 align:middle line:10%
is the other one, and
it was like, well,

00:46:29.560 --> 00:46:33.030 align:middle line:10%
who-- you need a
really good accountant

00:46:33.030 --> 00:46:36.320 align:middle line:10%
because you can often see-- you
have a couple come together.

00:46:36.320 --> 00:46:37.546 align:middle line:90%
Somebody's got the idea.

00:46:37.546 --> 00:46:38.920 align:middle line:84%
Somebody else is
going to carry--

00:46:38.920 --> 00:46:41.350 align:middle line:84%
a nurturer is going to
support and carry it through.

00:46:41.350 --> 00:46:42.870 align:middle line:84%
And it's like, OK,
but who's going

00:46:42.870 --> 00:46:46.145 align:middle line:84%
to just do the nitty-gritty
on the money side?

00:46:46.145 --> 00:46:47.520 align:middle line:84%
And so that was--
you really need

00:46:47.520 --> 00:46:49.310 align:middle line:84%
to go and get a
really good accountant

00:46:49.310 --> 00:46:54.260 align:middle line:90%
to keep that solid pit in place.

00:46:54.260 --> 00:46:59.530 align:middle line:84%
So the partners-- it can work
brilliantly, and it can--

00:46:59.530 --> 00:47:01.740 align:middle line:90%
until it doesn't.

00:47:01.740 --> 00:47:03.940 align:middle line:84%
Whatever combination
you put together,

00:47:03.940 --> 00:47:05.870 align:middle line:90%
there are always going to be--

00:47:05.870 --> 00:47:09.160 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Potential
shadow sides, right?

00:47:09.160 --> 00:47:10.910 align:middle line:84%
>>SMITH: And what I've
found is the beauty

00:47:10.910 --> 00:47:13.400 align:middle line:84%
of doing the
archetypes with couples

00:47:13.400 --> 00:47:17.350 align:middle line:84%
is it can really help them to
understand the other person's

00:47:17.350 --> 00:47:18.490 align:middle line:90%
perspective.

00:47:18.490 --> 00:47:20.950 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Well, like you
were saying, with the woman,

00:47:20.950 --> 00:47:24.090 align:middle line:84%
she was very attracted to
having a beautiful life,

00:47:24.090 --> 00:47:27.060 align:middle line:84%
and beauty of all kinds--
art and so forth--

00:47:27.060 --> 00:47:29.570 align:middle line:90%
was a major theme in her life.

00:47:29.570 --> 00:47:31.990 align:middle line:84%
And you can see
situations around you

00:47:31.990 --> 00:47:35.070 align:middle line:84%
where maybe the husband
thinks that's so silly.

00:47:35.070 --> 00:47:36.760 align:middle line:84%
Why would you spend
money on that?

00:47:36.760 --> 00:47:39.115 align:middle line:84%
And you can see that can
cause a lot of conflict.

00:47:39.115 --> 00:47:41.240 align:middle line:84%
>>SMITH: And it's sometimes
being able to say where

00:47:41.240 --> 00:47:45.380 align:middle line:84%
you've got-- say the husband
then has accumulator and ruler

00:47:45.380 --> 00:47:47.490 align:middle line:84%
there, and it's saying--
being able to explain,

00:47:47.490 --> 00:47:49.590 align:middle line:84%
this creates a lot of
anxiety around money--

00:47:49.590 --> 00:47:50.360 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:47:50.360 --> 00:47:52.540 align:middle line:90%
>>SMITH: --and then going, yeah.

00:47:52.540 --> 00:47:53.500 align:middle line:10%
Oh, yeah, that.

00:47:53.500 --> 00:47:54.916 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And the
other way, where

00:47:54.916 --> 00:47:57.330 align:middle line:84%
you have a woman who
may be doing a job.

00:47:57.330 --> 00:47:59.340 align:middle line:84%
In America, we only have
two weeks a year off,

00:47:59.340 --> 00:48:00.760 align:middle line:90%
which is absolutely inhumane.

00:48:00.760 --> 00:48:03.670 align:middle line:84%
But she's working hard so that
she can have a stable family

00:48:03.670 --> 00:48:05.510 align:middle line:84%
life and take care
of the kids, maybe

00:48:05.510 --> 00:48:07.430 align:middle line:84%
put the kids into
a private school.

00:48:07.430 --> 00:48:10.430 align:middle line:84%
And the husband may be
out doing day trading.

00:48:10.430 --> 00:48:13.785 align:middle line:84%
Now, who are the
day traders who are

00:48:13.785 --> 00:48:15.670 align:middle line:84%
kind of putting it
on red every day?

00:48:15.670 --> 00:48:16.780 align:middle line:90%
Who are those people?

00:48:16.780 --> 00:48:18.960 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHTER]

00:48:18.960 --> 00:48:22.030 align:middle line:84%
>>SMITH: That's a bit
of a maverick there.

00:48:22.030 --> 00:48:23.210 align:middle line:90%
It'll come in.

00:48:23.210 --> 00:48:23.860 align:middle line:90%
It'll come.

00:48:23.860 --> 00:48:28.440 align:middle line:84%
Yeah, and it often just--
it almost depersonalizes it,

00:48:28.440 --> 00:48:29.580 align:middle line:90%
and you can sort of say--

00:48:29.580 --> 00:48:31.060 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Yeah, that's what's
beautiful about this system.

00:48:31.060 --> 00:48:32.435 align:middle line:84%
>>SMITH: --this
is what you have.

00:48:32.435 --> 00:48:34.650 align:middle line:84%
And often, what I'll do is
actually get the cards out

00:48:34.650 --> 00:48:37.147 align:middle line:90%
and say, OK, this is you.

00:48:37.147 --> 00:48:37.980 align:middle line:90%
Stand in the middle.

00:48:37.980 --> 00:48:38.505 align:middle line:90%
This is you.

00:48:38.505 --> 00:48:39.910 align:middle line:90%
Stand in the middle.

00:48:39.910 --> 00:48:42.590 align:middle line:84%
Now, let's have a look
at where it works,

00:48:42.590 --> 00:48:45.430 align:middle line:84%
where your strengths
will support one another,

00:48:45.430 --> 00:48:47.230 align:middle line:84%
because often, it
can work beautifully,

00:48:47.230 --> 00:48:48.938 align:middle line:84%
where you have strength
over here that're

00:48:48.938 --> 00:48:51.260 align:middle line:84%
supporting weaknesses
over here--

00:48:51.260 --> 00:48:53.520 align:middle line:90%
and where it's going to clash.

00:48:53.520 --> 00:48:56.282 align:middle line:84%
And underneath it, it's
almost as though it's not--

00:48:56.282 --> 00:48:57.240 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: It's therapy.

00:48:57.240 --> 00:48:59.092 align:middle line:84%
It's almost couples
therapy, isn't it?

00:48:59.092 --> 00:49:00.550 align:middle line:84%
>>SMITH: Yeah, and
it can be easier

00:49:00.550 --> 00:49:01.870 align:middle line:90%
to address it through the money.

00:49:01.870 --> 00:49:03.170 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Yes, that make
sense-- than personal--

00:49:03.170 --> 00:49:03.440 align:middle line:84%
>>SMITH: Oh, that
sometimes happens.

00:49:03.440 --> 00:49:05.590 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: --trauma or
issues, although that

00:49:05.590 --> 00:49:07.277 align:middle line:84%
can cause personal
traumas and issue.

00:49:07.277 --> 00:49:07.860 align:middle line:90%
>>SMITH: Yeah.

00:49:07.860 --> 00:49:10.485 align:middle line:84%
I know there was one couple then
had this horrendous argument--

00:49:10.485 --> 00:49:11.950 align:middle line:90%
row all the way home.

00:49:11.950 --> 00:49:14.120 align:middle line:84%
But what happened was
there was a lot of stuff

00:49:14.120 --> 00:49:18.370 align:middle line:84%
got aired that hadn't
been aired before.

00:49:18.370 --> 00:49:20.329 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHING]

00:49:20.329 --> 00:49:22.120 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Now, let's
talk about businesses.

00:49:22.120 --> 00:49:24.970 align:middle line:84%
So let's say you're
going to go into business

00:49:24.970 --> 00:49:26.520 align:middle line:90%
with another partner or two.

00:49:26.520 --> 00:49:29.930 align:middle line:84%
What are the things that
really need to be in order?

00:49:29.930 --> 00:49:32.170 align:middle line:84%
What is it that any
business, in your mind,

00:49:32.170 --> 00:49:35.070 align:middle line:84%
really must have in
order to make a go of it?

00:49:35.070 --> 00:49:36.470 align:middle line:84%
And I know they're
all different.

00:49:36.470 --> 00:49:37.360 align:middle line:90%
It can be a service.

00:49:37.360 --> 00:49:39.930 align:middle line:84%
It can be a peace of
technology or whatnot.

00:49:39.930 --> 00:49:44.110 align:middle line:84%
What do you find is a good
spectrum of archetypes?

00:49:44.110 --> 00:49:46.480 align:middle line:84%
>>SMITH: I think it's-- so
the best thing to do is,

00:49:46.480 --> 00:49:48.350 align:middle line:84%
whenever you're doing that,
is to actually know what

00:49:48.350 --> 00:49:50.350 align:middle line:84%
your archetypes are and
know what the archetypes

00:49:50.350 --> 00:49:52.910 align:middle line:84%
of the people that-- the person
you are going into business

00:49:52.910 --> 00:49:55.310 align:middle line:90%
with is.

00:49:55.310 --> 00:49:59.690 align:middle line:84%
Each of the archetypes
has a different function.

00:49:59.690 --> 00:50:01.470 align:middle line:10%
So some of them,
you could probably--

00:50:01.470 --> 00:50:05.210 align:middle line:10%
so if you don't have a
celebrity, say, that's fine.

00:50:05.210 --> 00:50:06.710 align:middle line:84%
What you'd be looking
at is you need

00:50:06.710 --> 00:50:08.270 align:middle line:84%
somebody who's
going to do you PR,

00:50:08.270 --> 00:50:10.530 align:middle line:84%
who's going to do that
communication for you.

00:50:10.530 --> 00:50:12.530 align:middle line:84%
So you could sort
of outsource that.

00:50:12.530 --> 00:50:16.620 align:middle line:84%
If you don't have accumulator,
then actually, you could just

00:50:16.620 --> 00:50:18.590 align:middle line:84%
get-- make sure you've
got a good accountant.

00:50:18.590 --> 00:50:20.030 align:middle line:84%
But if you don't
have accumulator

00:50:20.030 --> 00:50:23.197 align:middle line:84%
and you're both
connectors, then it

00:50:23.197 --> 00:50:25.280 align:middle line:84%
starts to get a little bit
worrying because you're

00:50:25.280 --> 00:50:27.870 align:middle line:84%
going to have to take more
responsibility for the money,

00:50:27.870 --> 00:50:29.360 align:middle line:90%
the day-to-day stuff.

00:50:29.360 --> 00:50:31.730 align:middle line:84%
So accumulator--
you could probably--

00:50:31.730 --> 00:50:34.380 align:middle line:90%
that's your accountant.

00:50:34.380 --> 00:50:40.750 align:middle line:84%
The celebrity-- that would
be your PR department.

00:50:40.750 --> 00:50:43.090 align:middle line:84%
Maverick-- that's all
about your feeling

00:50:43.090 --> 00:50:44.990 align:middle line:90%
the market and the pricing.

00:50:44.990 --> 00:50:48.180 align:middle line:84%
So again, it sort of
helps if one of you's

00:50:48.180 --> 00:50:50.410 align:middle line:84%
got that because
otherwise, you're

00:50:50.410 --> 00:50:52.470 align:middle line:84%
probably going to
be undercharging.

00:50:52.470 --> 00:50:55.050 align:middle line:84%
You're just not going
to charge enough.

00:50:55.050 --> 00:50:57.360 align:middle line:90%
So it would help to have that.

00:50:57.360 --> 00:51:01.490 align:middle line:84%
The alchemist-- again,
that's the vision.

00:51:01.490 --> 00:51:06.020 align:middle line:84%
So it probably helps if you
both don't have that-- probably

00:51:06.020 --> 00:51:07.740 align:middle line:90%
have one vision.

00:51:07.740 --> 00:51:09.690 align:middle line:84%
But it needs somebody--
so it needs somebody

00:51:09.690 --> 00:51:12.390 align:middle line:84%
to hold the vision, somebody
to be able to price it.

00:51:12.390 --> 00:51:16.180 align:middle line:84%
Probably, initially,
the connector-- again,

00:51:16.180 --> 00:51:18.850 align:middle line:84%
a lot of these things
now can be outsourced.

00:51:18.850 --> 00:51:24.050 align:middle line:84%
You have people who have
collaboration managers.

00:51:24.050 --> 00:51:26.500 align:middle line:84%
So it's knowing that's something
you won't naturally do.

00:51:26.500 --> 00:51:28.030 align:middle line:90%
You need to find a connector.

00:51:28.030 --> 00:51:30.400 align:middle line:84%
But initially, in
the initial stages,

00:51:30.400 --> 00:51:33.710 align:middle line:84%
you need somebody who's going
to be prepared to connect and go

00:51:33.710 --> 00:51:36.330 align:middle line:90%
through.

00:51:36.330 --> 00:51:40.360 align:middle line:84%
The romantic is
actually the salesperson

00:51:40.360 --> 00:51:42.300 align:middle line:84%
because they're the
people who really

00:51:42.300 --> 00:51:45.790 align:middle line:84%
can feel-- I think they
can really feel what

00:51:45.790 --> 00:51:47.780 align:middle line:84%
the connection-- more
than the connector.

00:51:47.780 --> 00:51:49.640 align:middle line:84%
The connector tends
to be the person who

00:51:49.640 --> 00:51:51.637 align:middle line:90%
will find partners to work with.

00:51:51.637 --> 00:51:52.720 align:middle line:90%
They're the relationships.

00:51:52.720 --> 00:51:55.380 align:middle line:84%
But it's the romantic
who can really

00:51:55.380 --> 00:51:59.060 align:middle line:84%
feel what that person--
the message-- what

00:51:59.060 --> 00:52:02.420 align:middle line:90%
that person really wants.

00:52:02.420 --> 00:52:04.310 align:middle line:84%
So it would help
to have romantic

00:52:04.310 --> 00:52:06.189 align:middle line:84%
in there somewhere
to make sales.

00:52:06.189 --> 00:52:07.730 align:middle line:84%
If you haven't, then
you need to look

00:52:07.730 --> 00:52:11.096 align:middle line:84%
at bringing in a romantic
who can do the sales.

00:52:11.096 --> 00:52:12.720 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: To me, it
makes so much sense

00:52:12.720 --> 00:52:15.420 align:middle line:84%
that we take this
head-on and look at it.

00:52:15.420 --> 00:52:17.540 align:middle line:84%
Give us an example
of maybe a business

00:52:17.540 --> 00:52:20.300 align:middle line:84%
that you worked with that
was really floundering

00:52:20.300 --> 00:52:21.900 align:middle line:84%
that was able to
right themselves

00:52:21.900 --> 00:52:24.570 align:middle line:84%
after finding out
their archetypes.

00:52:24.570 --> 00:52:26.750 align:middle line:10%
>>SMITH: One of the ones
was the martial arts, where

00:52:26.750 --> 00:52:30.680 align:middle line:10%
we looked at it, and
there was a huge amount

00:52:30.680 --> 00:52:37.420 align:middle line:10%
of energy going into driving
this business forward, trying

00:52:37.420 --> 00:52:38.800 align:middle line:10%
to get it into profits.

00:52:38.800 --> 00:52:42.120 align:middle line:84%
And then, by identifying
this ruler wasn't there,

00:52:42.120 --> 00:52:46.620 align:middle line:84%
it really allowed him
to step back and go, OK,

00:52:46.620 --> 00:52:48.240 align:middle line:90%
I need to really rethink this.

00:52:48.240 --> 00:52:51.920 align:middle line:84%
And actually, what he had
was he had celebrity there.

00:52:51.920 --> 00:52:55.000 align:middle line:84%
So he loves to be
in the spotlight,

00:52:55.000 --> 00:52:59.310 align:middle line:84%
and he's a really inspirational
martial arts figure.

00:52:59.310 --> 00:53:00.940 align:middle line:84%
So it was about
saying, well, actually,

00:53:00.940 --> 00:53:03.760 align:middle line:84%
this is about me having
more of a profile,

00:53:03.760 --> 00:53:09.270 align:middle line:84%
and that profile then nurturing
other people to-- I mean,

00:53:09.270 --> 00:53:12.080 align:middle line:84%
he's nurturer first, and
it's really interesting,

00:53:12.080 --> 00:53:16.200 align:middle line:84%
watching the way that he works,
particularly with young men,

00:53:16.200 --> 00:53:20.700 align:middle line:84%
to-- he is really nurturing
them to allow-- especially

00:53:20.700 --> 00:53:25.560 align:middle line:84%
this young male energy--
to ground and be here.

00:53:25.560 --> 00:53:28.740 align:middle line:84%
So a real nurturer,
but actually needing

00:53:28.740 --> 00:53:34.810 align:middle line:84%
to take more of a leadership
role and to be prepared to let,

00:53:34.810 --> 00:53:36.560 align:middle line:84%
and actually letting
some of the-- saying,

00:53:36.560 --> 00:53:38.980 align:middle line:84%
well, the schools-- I'm
going to let them go.

00:53:38.980 --> 00:53:42.570 align:middle line:10%
If people want to take
them on, they can do that--

00:53:42.570 --> 00:53:45.460 align:middle line:10%
and actually then
embarking on a new project.

00:53:45.460 --> 00:53:48.820 align:middle line:84%
So actually stemming the loss--
it's actually just walking

00:53:48.820 --> 00:53:50.695 align:middle line:84%
away, going, no,
that wasn't right.

00:53:50.695 --> 00:53:52.320 align:middle line:10%
>>REGINA: Because if
you've been trying

00:53:52.320 --> 00:53:55.600 align:middle line:10%
to live your not
type, then ultimately,

00:53:55.600 --> 00:53:58.300 align:middle line:10%
you may be forced to look
at these kinds of decisions.

00:53:58.300 --> 00:54:01.200 align:middle line:84%
You have to, as you say, cut
your losses at that point.

00:54:01.200 --> 00:54:02.000 align:middle line:90%
>>SMITH: Yeah.

00:54:02.000 --> 00:54:05.640 align:middle line:10%
Another client I
have is an artist,

00:54:05.640 --> 00:54:10.140 align:middle line:10%
and that was really interesting
because she has-- she's

00:54:10.140 --> 00:54:14.530 align:middle line:10%
a connector, romantic,
and nurturer.

00:54:14.530 --> 00:54:16.692 align:middle line:84%
And she was one of the
first people I worked with,

00:54:16.692 --> 00:54:19.150 align:middle line:84%
and it was fascinating because
you say, well, actually, you

00:54:19.150 --> 00:54:20.650 align:middle line:84%
can imagine different
artists would

00:54:20.650 --> 00:54:23.090 align:middle line:90%
have different archetypes.

00:54:23.090 --> 00:54:25.000 align:middle line:84%
But for her, she was
very much about being

00:54:25.000 --> 00:54:26.800 align:middle line:84%
able to-- her particular
talent is being

00:54:26.800 --> 00:54:29.790 align:middle line:84%
able to connect with somebody
and create something beautiful

00:54:29.790 --> 00:54:31.250 align:middle line:84%
that nurtures them
in their home.

00:54:31.250 --> 00:54:34.200 align:middle line:10%
And she has this-- it's
almost like psychic ability

00:54:34.200 --> 00:54:36.870 align:middle line:10%
to create a painting with
colors that she's never

00:54:36.870 --> 00:54:41.340 align:middle line:10%
seen in the home, that
she just places it.

00:54:41.340 --> 00:54:43.370 align:middle line:10%
And for her, again,
it was actually

00:54:43.370 --> 00:54:46.370 align:middle line:10%
recognizing that
she could charge

00:54:46.370 --> 00:54:50.860 align:middle line:10%
a lot more for those paintings
by actually really getting

00:54:50.860 --> 00:54:53.020 align:middle line:10%
a sense of the value of them.

00:54:53.020 --> 00:54:56.430 align:middle line:84%
And as a connector-- but
before she could do that,

00:54:56.430 --> 00:54:58.550 align:middle line:84%
she had to start to
connect to the money.

00:54:58.550 --> 00:55:00.310 align:middle line:10%
>>REGINA: Yes, interesting.

00:55:00.310 --> 00:55:02.700 align:middle line:10%
OK, so now we're at
the point-- we still

00:55:02.700 --> 00:55:04.530 align:middle line:10%
have just a few minutes left.

00:55:04.530 --> 00:55:08.600 align:middle line:84%
We can talk about
how we take this test

00:55:08.600 --> 00:55:10.547 align:middle line:90%
and then how we apply it.

00:55:10.547 --> 00:55:12.630 align:middle line:84%
And like you said-- we
were talking about earlier,

00:55:12.630 --> 00:55:14.430 align:middle line:84%
don't freak out
if you don't like

00:55:14.430 --> 00:55:16.640 align:middle line:84%
what the test is
revealing to you.

00:55:16.640 --> 00:55:18.480 align:middle line:84%
But there is a proper
way to take it,

00:55:18.480 --> 00:55:20.104 align:middle line:84%
and if you don't do
it that way, you're

00:55:20.104 --> 00:55:21.607 align:middle line:84%
going to get skewed
results, right?

00:55:21.607 --> 00:55:22.190 align:middle line:90%
>>SMITH: Yeah.

00:55:22.190 --> 00:55:24.640 align:middle line:90%
It's quite a robust test.

00:55:24.640 --> 00:55:27.780 align:middle line:10%
Kendall SummerHawk,
who developed it-- it's

00:55:27.780 --> 00:55:29.080 align:middle line:10%
pretty good.

00:55:29.080 --> 00:55:31.620 align:middle line:84%
But the way-- you can
download the assessment

00:55:31.620 --> 00:55:35.020 align:middle line:84%
from our website, which
is acreativespace.org.

00:55:35.020 --> 00:55:37.860 align:middle line:10%
And when you print
it off and then--

00:55:37.860 --> 00:55:40.430 align:middle line:10%
what it has is a set of
questions, which you simply

00:55:40.430 --> 00:55:43.120 align:middle line:10%
are asked to score
one to five as

00:55:43.120 --> 00:55:45.260 align:middle line:10%
agree, disagree,
that sort of thing.

00:55:45.260 --> 00:55:48.430 align:middle line:84%
And then, when you get to the
bottom, it walks you through.

00:55:48.430 --> 00:55:51.210 align:middle line:84%
You just total it until
you've got all the totals,

00:55:51.210 --> 00:55:54.690 align:middle line:84%
and then it will reveal itself
as to what your archetypes are.

00:55:54.690 --> 00:56:00.050 align:middle line:84%
And then, you're ranking them in
terms of top, all the way down.

00:56:00.050 --> 00:56:02.630 align:middle line:84%
The best thing is
not to over-think it.

00:56:02.630 --> 00:56:05.430 align:middle line:84%
So it takes about
eight minutes to do.

00:56:05.430 --> 00:56:07.110 align:middle line:90%
So just don't over-think it.

00:56:07.110 --> 00:56:08.160 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Just feel it.

00:56:08.160 --> 00:56:10.102 align:middle line:84%
Mark whatever
instinctively comes first.

00:56:10.102 --> 00:56:10.935 align:middle line:90%
>>SMITH: Absolutely.

00:56:10.935 --> 00:56:13.570 align:middle line:90%


00:56:13.570 --> 00:56:15.400 align:middle line:90%
And trust it.

00:56:15.400 --> 00:56:19.440 align:middle line:84%
Honestly, it is a pretty
robust assessment.

00:56:19.440 --> 00:56:23.510 align:middle line:84%
And I've had people try to
do it again and come out

00:56:23.510 --> 00:56:25.210 align:middle line:90%
with exactly the same result.

00:56:25.210 --> 00:56:26.760 align:middle line:90%
So it is pretty robust.

00:56:26.760 --> 00:56:29.670 align:middle line:84%
Now, one of things that happens
is people may have ties.

00:56:29.670 --> 00:56:33.250 align:middle line:84%
So you might find that you're
tied first place, second place.

00:56:33.250 --> 00:56:37.910 align:middle line:84%
So that-- let me take a
couple of minutes on that

00:56:37.910 --> 00:56:40.120 align:middle line:84%
because what a
tie is-- if you've

00:56:40.120 --> 00:56:44.699 align:middle line:84%
got a tie in the first place,
then what you'll need to decide

00:56:44.699 --> 00:56:46.740 align:middle line:84%
is-- one of those will be
your primary archetype,

00:56:46.740 --> 00:56:49.100 align:middle line:84%
and then one will be
your second archetype.

00:56:49.100 --> 00:56:53.550 align:middle line:84%
And it's worth just looking
through the archetypes.

00:56:53.550 --> 00:56:55.310 align:middle line:84%
There's a very simple
introduction to them

00:56:55.310 --> 00:56:59.204 align:middle line:84%
that's available from our site
to just see-- well, and also,

00:56:59.204 --> 00:57:00.370 align:middle line:90%
just from listening to this.

00:57:00.370 --> 00:57:04.330 align:middle line:90%
Which one feels the right one?

00:57:04.330 --> 00:57:06.490 align:middle line:84%
And then, if you have a
tie, say, in second-- say

00:57:06.490 --> 00:57:07.920 align:middle line:90%
you have a tie in second place.

00:57:07.920 --> 00:57:09.240 align:middle line:90%
Then they, too, tie.

00:57:09.240 --> 00:57:11.080 align:middle line:84%
That would become your
second and third one.

00:57:11.080 --> 00:57:12.410 align:middle line:90%
You're done.

00:57:12.410 --> 00:57:14.590 align:middle line:84%
If you got a tie in third
place, then again, you're

00:57:14.590 --> 00:57:16.670 align:middle line:84%
looking at them, saying,
OK, which one of these

00:57:16.670 --> 00:57:21.570 align:middle line:84%
am I going to take
as my third one?

00:57:21.570 --> 00:57:25.690 align:middle line:84%
Because sometimes-- I have
an alchemist and connector

00:57:25.690 --> 00:57:27.700 align:middle line:90%
tied in my third place.

00:57:27.700 --> 00:57:30.780 align:middle line:84%
Now, alchemist is very
much part of who I am,

00:57:30.780 --> 00:57:31.867 align:middle line:90%
so I didn't feel like--

00:57:31.867 --> 00:57:33.950 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: You intuitively
resonated with that one.

00:57:33.950 --> 00:57:36.440 align:middle line:84%
>>SMITH: Yeah, so I
could see that one.

00:57:36.440 --> 00:57:39.750 align:middle line:84%
And so actually, the one that
I wanted to bring forward

00:57:39.750 --> 00:57:43.190 align:middle line:84%
a bit more was the connector
because looking at the three,

00:57:43.190 --> 00:57:46.570 align:middle line:84%
it was to have a little
bit more faith around money

00:57:46.570 --> 00:57:48.220 align:middle line:84%
was something that
would really--

00:57:48.220 --> 00:57:52.219 align:middle line:84%
that gift would help me with
the ruler and the accumulator.

00:57:52.219 --> 00:57:53.260 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: It makes sense.

00:57:53.260 --> 00:57:54.810 align:middle line:90%
So just go lightly.

00:57:54.810 --> 00:57:57.590 align:middle line:84%
Just let it intuitively
come to you, more or less.

00:57:57.590 --> 00:58:00.370 align:middle line:84%
And then finally, do
you find that if we

00:58:00.370 --> 00:58:03.840 align:middle line:84%
were to take this test, we
were to face it head-on,

00:58:03.840 --> 00:58:06.750 align:middle line:84%
and then even look at the shadow
side, the thing we are not,

00:58:06.750 --> 00:58:08.890 align:middle line:84%
take that into
consideration-- if we took

00:58:08.890 --> 00:58:10.830 align:middle line:84%
that test a year
later, for example,

00:58:10.830 --> 00:58:14.670 align:middle line:90%
would our archetypes change?

00:58:14.670 --> 00:58:17.400 align:middle line:90%
>>SMITH: Possibly.

00:58:17.400 --> 00:58:22.370 align:middle line:84%
I first took the test probably
nearly two years ago now.

00:58:22.370 --> 00:58:26.310 align:middle line:84%
And actually, my top archetype
at the time was alchemist.

00:58:26.310 --> 00:58:29.750 align:middle line:84%
So I had alchemist, accumulator,
ruler, in that order.

00:58:29.750 --> 00:58:33.910 align:middle line:84%
I took it six months later,
and the alchemist and the ruler

00:58:33.910 --> 00:58:34.710 align:middle line:90%
had flipped.

00:58:34.710 --> 00:58:37.650 align:middle line:84%
Now, in that time, I'd
separated from my husband

00:58:37.650 --> 00:58:39.900 align:middle line:84%
and my father had
died, so there'd

00:58:39.900 --> 00:58:43.240 align:middle line:84%
been big changes for
me, and it was about me,

00:58:43.240 --> 00:58:46.221 align:middle line:84%
I think, stepping into--
moving that ruler up.

00:58:46.221 --> 00:58:47.470 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: So life change that.

00:58:47.470 --> 00:58:48.370 align:middle line:84%
>>SMITH: So life
can change that.

00:58:48.370 --> 00:58:49.578 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: So we're not fixed.

00:58:49.578 --> 00:58:51.590 align:middle line:84%
No matter what we find,
it's not fixed in stone.

00:58:51.590 --> 00:58:55.070 align:middle line:10%
>>SMITH: No, but it's also
just really-- just loving

00:58:55.070 --> 00:58:59.170 align:middle line:10%
what you are, because
often, if you're not,

00:58:59.170 --> 00:59:04.330 align:middle line:10%
and you've got money problems or
money issues, there's the clue,

00:59:04.330 --> 00:59:08.102 align:middle line:10%
because it's pulling us forward
to being more authentic.

00:59:08.102 --> 00:59:09.060 align:middle line:10%
That's what it's about.

00:59:09.060 --> 00:59:11.309 align:middle line:10%
>>REGINA: Well, on that note,
I love what you're doing

00:59:11.309 --> 00:59:15.000 align:middle line:10%
and that Kendall invented
this whole system.

00:59:15.000 --> 00:59:18.020 align:middle line:84%
And I certainly would encourage
everyone to take a look at it.

00:59:18.020 --> 00:59:19.410 align:middle line:90%
It's revealing.

00:59:19.410 --> 00:59:20.450 align:middle line:90%
Thank you for your time.

00:59:20.450 --> 00:59:21.658 align:middle line:90%
