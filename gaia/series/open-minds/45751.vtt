00:00:28.209 --> 00:00:30.750 align:middle line:10%
>>REGINA MEREDITH: I'm here at
the International UFO Congress

00:00:30.750 --> 00:00:32.364 align:middle line:10%
in Scottsdale,
Arizona, where I've

00:00:32.364 --> 00:00:33.780 align:middle line:10%
had a chance to
catch up with some

00:00:33.780 --> 00:00:36.780 align:middle line:10%
of the top minds in
the world of ufology.

00:00:36.780 --> 00:00:40.630 align:middle line:84%
One such person was Tim
Good, an English gentleman

00:00:40.630 --> 00:00:43.870 align:middle line:84%
who has spent the majority
of his life having access

00:00:43.870 --> 00:00:48.297 align:middle line:84%
to some of the most top
secret archives in the field.

00:00:48.297 --> 00:00:49.880 align:middle line:84%
Thank you so much
for joining us, Tim,

00:00:49.880 --> 00:00:53.540 align:middle line:84%
and I was so intrigued with
some of the stories and images.

00:00:53.540 --> 00:00:56.564 align:middle line:84%
And I took down pages
and pages of notes;

00:00:56.564 --> 00:00:58.980 align:middle line:84%
however, we're going to focus
maybe a little more in depth

00:00:58.980 --> 00:01:01.340 align:middle line:84%
on only six or
seven of the topics.

00:01:01.340 --> 00:01:03.550 align:middle line:84%
And one of them that
I found interesting

00:01:03.550 --> 00:01:06.130 align:middle line:84%
that I have not heard
people speak about

00:01:06.130 --> 00:01:10.760 align:middle line:84%
is the notion that it's not just
reverse engineered craft that

00:01:10.760 --> 00:01:12.480 align:middle line:90%
have happened around the world.

00:01:12.480 --> 00:01:15.640 align:middle line:84%
But you say the truth is
since '70s, we've been-- I

00:01:15.640 --> 00:01:18.840 align:middle line:84%
think you said '70s-- we have
actually been experimenting

00:01:18.840 --> 00:01:21.025 align:middle line:84%
with and flying
alien craft directly.

00:01:21.025 --> 00:01:23.400 align:middle line:84%
>>TIMOTHY GOOD: I think even
earlier than that, actually.

00:01:23.400 --> 00:01:24.941 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Talk about
this phenomenon.

00:01:24.941 --> 00:01:28.520 align:middle line:84%
>>GOOD: My information
comes from several sources.

00:01:28.520 --> 00:01:31.450 align:middle line:10%
One is a former army
intelligence officer,

00:01:31.450 --> 00:01:33.610 align:middle line:10%
whom I've known
for very many years

00:01:33.610 --> 00:01:38.400 align:middle line:10%
and he's a very trusty
aerospace journalist.

00:01:38.400 --> 00:01:45.770 align:middle line:10%
And he indicated to me
that from the mid '50s,

00:01:45.770 --> 00:01:48.410 align:middle line:10%
we were developing
alien technology.

00:01:48.410 --> 00:01:50.890 align:middle line:84%
And we had mastered
alien technology

00:01:50.890 --> 00:01:52.890 align:middle line:90%
in a relatively short time.

00:01:52.890 --> 00:01:57.390 align:middle line:84%
That was quite
surprising apparently.

00:01:57.390 --> 00:02:04.090 align:middle line:84%
And we also have been
given actual craft

00:02:04.090 --> 00:02:07.430 align:middle line:84%
by certain aliens, who have
our best interests at heart.

00:02:07.430 --> 00:02:11.070 align:middle line:84%
We have been given the
technology and the craft,

00:02:11.070 --> 00:02:14.420 align:middle line:84%
and we have been flying
them for a very long time.

00:02:14.420 --> 00:02:15.670 align:middle line:90%
That is my information.

00:02:15.670 --> 00:02:19.990 align:middle line:84%
And even Gordon
Cooper, the astronaut,

00:02:19.990 --> 00:02:24.010 align:middle line:84%
whom I knew, we corresponded--
I think we spoke on the phone

00:02:24.010 --> 00:02:24.910 align:middle line:90%
probably once.

00:02:24.910 --> 00:02:27.720 align:middle line:84%
But according to
a friend of his,

00:02:27.720 --> 00:02:32.970 align:middle line:84%
who I know and trust
implicitly-- well,

00:02:32.970 --> 00:02:35.800 align:middle line:84%
it's known that
Gordon Cooper became

00:02:35.800 --> 00:02:38.470 align:middle line:84%
very frustrated with the way
the United Nations ignored

00:02:38.470 --> 00:02:42.430 align:middle line:90%
the subject back in 1978.

00:02:42.430 --> 00:02:44.200 align:middle line:84%
There was a meeting,
I think, in Florida--

00:02:44.200 --> 00:02:46.680 align:middle line:84%
a Florida branch of
the United Nations--

00:02:46.680 --> 00:02:50.330 align:middle line:84%
and he was very, very
unhappy about it.

00:02:50.330 --> 00:02:54.340 align:middle line:90%
And he said, what does it take.

00:02:54.340 --> 00:02:56.880 align:middle line:84%
Do I have to fly
one of these craft

00:02:56.880 --> 00:03:02.560 align:middle line:84%
and land it outside the United
Nations building in New York?

00:03:02.560 --> 00:03:04.575 align:middle line:84%
He was actually
prepared to do that.

00:03:04.575 --> 00:03:05.700 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: He wasn't joking.

00:03:05.700 --> 00:03:08.390 align:middle line:90%
>>GOOD: No.

00:03:08.390 --> 00:03:10.692 align:middle line:84%
I thought it was a joke until
this friend said, no, he

00:03:10.692 --> 00:03:12.770 align:middle line:84%
was being absolutely
serious because quite

00:03:12.770 --> 00:03:15.270 align:middle line:84%
a number of the astronauts
had been flying these craft.

00:03:15.270 --> 00:03:19.217 align:middle line:90%
There is a real space program.

00:03:19.217 --> 00:03:19.800 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:03:19.800 --> 00:03:21.600 align:middle line:84%
>>GOOD: And there is
a cover space program,

00:03:21.600 --> 00:03:23.261 align:middle line:90%
which is the NASA space program.

00:03:23.261 --> 00:03:24.010 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Exactly.

00:03:24.010 --> 00:03:26.080 align:middle line:84%
>>GOOD: My information
is, for example,

00:03:26.080 --> 00:03:29.690 align:middle line:84%
that United States Air Force
Space Command is actually

00:03:29.690 --> 00:03:32.610 align:middle line:84%
in charge of the
proper space program.

00:03:32.610 --> 00:03:35.846 align:middle line:84%
And this information
comes via Paul LaViolette,

00:03:35.846 --> 00:03:36.970 align:middle line:90%
who is an excellent writer.

00:03:36.970 --> 00:03:37.235 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:03:37.235 --> 00:03:38.290 align:middle line:90%
I know Paul LaViolette.

00:03:38.290 --> 00:03:39.060 align:middle line:90%
>>GOOD: He's a physicist.

00:03:39.060 --> 00:03:39.770 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:03:39.770 --> 00:03:42.690 align:middle line:84%
>>GOOD: And he gets hold of
some very good information.

00:03:42.690 --> 00:03:43.700 align:middle line:90%
And we get on well.

00:03:43.700 --> 00:03:46.505 align:middle line:84%
I've only met him once,
but he's a very bright lad.

00:03:46.505 --> 00:03:47.380 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes, he is.

00:03:47.380 --> 00:03:48.490 align:middle line:90%
He's a good researcher.

00:03:48.490 --> 00:03:55.190 align:middle line:84%
>>GOOD: And he said he was told
that the US Air Force Space

00:03:55.190 --> 00:04:00.110 align:middle line:84%
Command had a base in the middle
of the Pacific Ocean somewhere.

00:04:00.110 --> 00:04:03.760 align:middle line:84%
They've got a huge shuttle fleet
that goes regularly to the moon

00:04:03.760 --> 00:04:05.880 align:middle line:90%
and to Mars.

00:04:05.880 --> 00:04:06.890 align:middle line:90%
Apparently.

00:04:06.890 --> 00:04:09.370 align:middle line:90%
And I don't disbelieve him.

00:04:09.370 --> 00:04:12.520 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Well,
and it-- I believe

00:04:12.520 --> 00:04:16.040 align:middle line:84%
it was Neil Armstrong
that said, there

00:04:16.040 --> 00:04:19.640 align:middle line:84%
were other spacecraft
and things on the moon.

00:04:19.640 --> 00:04:21.709 align:middle line:84%
>>GOOD: That was actually
picked up and recorded.

00:04:21.709 --> 00:04:23.200 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes, it was.

00:04:23.200 --> 00:04:26.920 align:middle line:84%
>>GOOD: I think the Russians,
at least, had picked it up.

00:04:26.920 --> 00:04:29.630 align:middle line:90%
And so it's a matter of fact.

00:04:29.630 --> 00:04:35.240 align:middle line:84%
But I had a friend called
Pamela Hanford, who was in MI6.

00:04:35.240 --> 00:04:37.500 align:middle line:90%
I'd known her for many years.

00:04:37.500 --> 00:04:39.580 align:middle line:84%
She's passed away now,
which is why she allowed

00:04:39.580 --> 00:04:42.560 align:middle line:84%
me to use her name for the
first time, because the story

00:04:42.560 --> 00:04:45.100 align:middle line:84%
actually came out in my first
book, "Above Top Secret,"

00:04:45.100 --> 00:04:48.470 align:middle line:84%
but I couldn't mention her
name because of her background.

00:04:48.470 --> 00:04:54.990 align:middle line:84%
But in any event, she
participated in, I would think,

00:04:54.990 --> 00:05:01.020 align:middle line:84%
a restricted NASA conference
in 1984 in Anacapri in Italy.

00:05:01.020 --> 00:05:06.090 align:middle line:84%
And her bedroom adjoined that of
Neil Armstrong and the bedroom

00:05:06.090 --> 00:05:09.790 align:middle line:84%
beyond that was
Buzz Aldrin, and she

00:05:09.790 --> 00:05:12.701 align:middle line:84%
said she overheard-- I'm quite
sure she bugged their rooms.

00:05:12.701 --> 00:05:15.200 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Well, if she's MI6,
likely she had the technology.

00:05:15.200 --> 00:05:16.052 align:middle line:90%
>>GOOD: As they do.

00:05:16.052 --> 00:05:19.440 align:middle line:84%
And she overheard
this conversation

00:05:19.440 --> 00:05:21.990 align:middle line:84%
with a German professor,
Professor Schwartz,

00:05:21.990 --> 00:05:23.757 align:middle line:84%
saying, tell us,
come on, come on.

00:05:23.757 --> 00:05:25.465 align:middle line:84%
Tell us what really
happened on the moon.

00:05:25.465 --> 00:05:26.670 align:middle line:84%
And he said, oh,
it was dreadful.

00:05:26.670 --> 00:05:28.544 align:middle line:84%
We got there and there
were these space ships

00:05:28.544 --> 00:05:30.220 align:middle line:84%
and they were menacing
and everything.

00:05:30.220 --> 00:05:34.760 align:middle line:84%
And Pamela got all this
and so at cocktails later

00:05:34.760 --> 00:05:36.800 align:middle line:84%
on that day or the
next day, I forget

00:05:36.800 --> 00:05:40.914 align:middle line:84%
which, she accosted Armstrong
and said, oh, by the way,

00:05:40.914 --> 00:05:43.080 align:middle line:84%
can you tell me more about
what went on on the moon?

00:05:43.080 --> 00:05:45.890 align:middle line:84%
And he told her, he said,
yeah, we were very frightened.

00:05:45.890 --> 00:05:47.850 align:middle line:90%
It was very, very disturbing.

00:05:47.850 --> 00:05:49.884 align:middle line:90%
There were two large menacing--

00:05:49.884 --> 00:05:50.550 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: I see.

00:05:50.550 --> 00:05:52.250 align:middle line:90%
Menacing.

00:05:52.250 --> 00:05:54.910 align:middle line:90%
>>GOOD: They found it menacing.

00:05:54.910 --> 00:05:57.310 align:middle line:90%
And he said that was it.

00:05:57.310 --> 00:06:01.110 align:middle line:84%
It was just a short
hop and that was it.

00:06:01.110 --> 00:06:04.303 align:middle line:84%
So that's the cover space
program, that which is NASA--

00:06:04.303 --> 00:06:05.511 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: That's interesting.

00:06:05.511 --> 00:06:06.350 align:middle line:90%
You know there's--

00:06:06.350 --> 00:06:07.308 align:middle line:90%
>>GOOD: -in my opinion.

00:06:07.308 --> 00:06:10.340 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: -there's so much
contradictory information

00:06:10.340 --> 00:06:12.610 align:middle line:84%
coming out about
the moon in general,

00:06:12.610 --> 00:06:14.330 align:middle line:90%
about the moon landing.

00:06:14.330 --> 00:06:17.420 align:middle line:84%
There was even claims that
there was a secondary film made

00:06:17.420 --> 00:06:21.940 align:middle line:84%
of the moon landing that
did not show and implicate

00:06:21.940 --> 00:06:23.490 align:middle line:90%
all these other things involved.

00:06:23.490 --> 00:06:23.618 align:middle line:90%
>>GOOD: Yes.

00:06:23.618 --> 00:06:23.940 align:middle line:90%
I wouldn't be surprised, yeah.

00:06:23.940 --> 00:06:25.690 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Because-- you
believe that's true?

00:06:25.690 --> 00:06:27.520 align:middle line:84%
>>GOOD: I don't know,
but it sounds likely.

00:06:27.520 --> 00:06:30.480 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Yes, I mean Stanley
Kubrick was supposedly involved

00:06:30.480 --> 00:06:33.930 align:middle line:84%
and was open about this, and
films have been made on this.

00:06:33.930 --> 00:06:37.905 align:middle line:84%
And it would make sense if
what they actually found up

00:06:37.905 --> 00:06:39.085 align:middle line:90%
there was the other.

00:06:39.085 --> 00:06:39.585 align:middle line:90%
>>GOOD: Yes.

00:06:39.585 --> 00:06:40.560 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Mm-hmm.

00:06:40.560 --> 00:06:42.576 align:middle line:84%
To have an alternate
version of that.

00:06:42.576 --> 00:06:47.120 align:middle line:84%
>>GOOD: And Pamela also told
me that the United States has

00:06:47.120 --> 00:06:50.060 align:middle line:84%
been in regular
communication with a planet.

00:06:50.060 --> 00:06:53.865 align:middle line:84%
She didn't reveal to me what
planet, she just said a planet.

00:06:53.865 --> 00:06:55.990 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So when they
found these menacing-looking

00:06:55.990 --> 00:07:02.000 align:middle line:84%
structures, or the ships on
the moon, craft on the moon,

00:07:02.000 --> 00:07:04.820 align:middle line:84%
did they view whatever
that might be associated

00:07:04.820 --> 00:07:06.880 align:middle line:84%
with as a potential
threat to humanity?

00:07:06.880 --> 00:07:08.360 align:middle line:90%
>>GOOD: That's what they felt.

00:07:08.360 --> 00:07:11.780 align:middle line:84%
I don't know about that, but
they certainly sure as hell

00:07:11.780 --> 00:07:14.240 align:middle line:90%
thought it was a threat to them.

00:07:14.240 --> 00:07:16.630 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Interesting
because we spoke earlier,

00:07:16.630 --> 00:07:20.330 align:middle line:84%
just touched on for a moment,
the fact that there are some

00:07:20.330 --> 00:07:24.399 align:middle line:84%
forces that are not working in
the best interest of humanity--

00:07:24.399 --> 00:07:24.940 align:middle line:90%
>>GOOD: Sure.

00:07:24.940 --> 00:07:26.940 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: -involved in these
hybridization programs.

00:07:26.940 --> 00:07:27.810 align:middle line:90%
>>GOOD: Definitely.

00:07:27.810 --> 00:07:30.415 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And who knows
if those were involved,

00:07:30.415 --> 00:07:32.290 align:middle line:84%
if those had anything
to do with that or not.

00:07:32.290 --> 00:07:34.540 align:middle line:84%
But the sense that
they had of danger

00:07:34.540 --> 00:07:36.070 align:middle line:84%
is kind of interesting,
because some

00:07:36.070 --> 00:07:38.900 align:middle line:84%
of these men-- we know
Gordon Cooper and Edgar

00:07:38.900 --> 00:07:42.790 align:middle line:84%
Mitchell-- were also very
intuitive and open men as well.

00:07:42.790 --> 00:07:45.750 align:middle line:90%
So I find that link interesting.

00:07:45.750 --> 00:07:49.960 align:middle line:84%
And so these spacecraft
have been loaned to us,

00:07:49.960 --> 00:07:51.542 align:middle line:84%
so to speak, from
off planet cultures

00:07:51.542 --> 00:07:53.750 align:middle line:84%
so that we would be able to
get up to speed and the--

00:07:53.750 --> 00:07:54.570 align:middle line:84%
>>GOOD: I think some
of them are being--

00:07:54.570 --> 00:07:55.710 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: -technology
to defend ourselves.

00:07:55.710 --> 00:07:56.800 align:middle line:90%
>>GOOD: Yes.

00:07:56.800 --> 00:08:00.130 align:middle line:84%
I mean, we actually developed
the technology from,

00:08:00.130 --> 00:08:03.370 align:middle line:84%
probably from captured
craft quite early on,

00:08:03.370 --> 00:08:06.370 align:middle line:84%
but I think things improved
from the mid 1950s,

00:08:06.370 --> 00:08:08.690 align:middle line:90%
according to my information.

00:08:08.690 --> 00:08:12.970 align:middle line:84%
That we were actually
being given some craft

00:08:12.970 --> 00:08:14.982 align:middle line:90%
and technology.

00:08:14.982 --> 00:08:17.140 align:middle line:84%
So we've got highly
advanced craft

00:08:17.140 --> 00:08:19.250 align:middle line:84%
that are being
flown by our guys.

00:08:19.250 --> 00:08:22.340 align:middle line:84%
That's been going on
in Italy, for example.

00:08:22.340 --> 00:08:28.760 align:middle line:84%
Professor Stefano Breccia told
me that he was aware of-- he

00:08:28.760 --> 00:08:31.940 align:middle line:84%
told me this, what, three years
ago, nearly three years ago,

00:08:31.940 --> 00:08:34.450 align:middle line:84%
yeah, I think it
was-- and he said

00:08:34.450 --> 00:08:41.080 align:middle line:84%
that there were craft
that were being flown

00:08:41.080 --> 00:08:44.875 align:middle line:84%
by 10 to 15 Italian
Air Force pilots.

00:08:44.875 --> 00:08:46.750 align:middle line:84%
And he gave me some
funny stories about them,

00:08:46.750 --> 00:08:49.920 align:middle line:84%
because they've been
flying-- they were trained

00:08:49.920 --> 00:08:52.210 align:middle line:84%
by the alien
group-- the Amicizia

00:08:52.210 --> 00:08:54.070 align:middle line:90%
Group-- over a lengthy period.

00:08:54.070 --> 00:08:56.624 align:middle line:84%
But actually the craft
are very easy to fly.

00:08:56.624 --> 00:08:58.040 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So I
remember you saying

00:08:58.040 --> 00:08:59.998 align:middle line:84%
that, much easier than
what we've come up with.

00:08:59.998 --> 00:09:01.807 align:middle line:84%
Our technology is so
primitive relatively.

00:09:01.807 --> 00:09:02.890 align:middle line:90%
>>GOOD: To such an extent.

00:09:02.890 --> 00:09:05.060 align:middle line:84%
Stefano is a pilot,
a qualified pilot,

00:09:05.060 --> 00:09:08.330 align:middle line:84%
and he said he just
found it boring

00:09:08.330 --> 00:09:11.200 align:middle line:84%
and he just made notes on
his Olivetti typewriter

00:09:11.200 --> 00:09:15.104 align:middle line:84%
sitting in the flying
saucer with a German pilot.

00:09:15.104 --> 00:09:16.020 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Interesting.

00:09:16.020 --> 00:09:18.030 align:middle line:84%
Talk a little bit about
the Amicizia Group,

00:09:18.030 --> 00:09:20.210 align:middle line:84%
the friendship group,
and what that was about.

00:09:20.210 --> 00:09:23.030 align:middle line:84%
>>GOOD: Amicizia started
in the mid 1950s.

00:09:23.030 --> 00:09:26.960 align:middle line:84%
In Italy it was called
Amicizia, and the Italians

00:09:26.960 --> 00:09:29.820 align:middle line:84%
were the first to publish
information about it.

00:09:29.820 --> 00:09:32.440 align:middle line:84%
But in fact, it was going
on in many countries,

00:09:32.440 --> 00:09:35.070 align:middle line:90%
in the former Soviet Union.

00:09:35.070 --> 00:09:39.730 align:middle line:84%
And Stefano himself had
addressed the Soviet Academy

00:09:39.730 --> 00:09:42.160 align:middle line:84%
of Sciences at one
time as a scientist

00:09:42.160 --> 00:09:45.210 align:middle line:84%
on his particular
specialties and things,

00:09:45.210 --> 00:09:47.440 align:middle line:90%
not about the alien situation.

00:09:47.440 --> 00:09:53.250 align:middle line:84%
But he said there
were people, Russians

00:09:53.250 --> 00:09:58.860 align:middle line:84%
were communicating with
aliens as far away as a Chile.

00:09:58.860 --> 00:10:01.600 align:middle line:84%
There was Friendship
Isle in Chile.

00:10:01.600 --> 00:10:04.025 align:middle line:84%
It wasn't called Amicizia,
so the people in Chile

00:10:04.025 --> 00:10:06.150 align:middle line:84%
were well-aware that it
was going on, some of them.

00:10:06.150 --> 00:10:08.730 align:middle line:84%
And I'm well aware
at that period

00:10:08.730 --> 00:10:12.850 align:middle line:84%
of time, the mid 1950s,
contacts were building up

00:10:12.850 --> 00:10:16.080 align:middle line:84%
with individuals in the United
Kingdom, in the United States,

00:10:16.080 --> 00:10:19.910 align:middle line:84%
in Russia, in Australia,
many, many countries

00:10:19.910 --> 00:10:21.250 align:middle line:90%
around the world.

00:10:21.250 --> 00:10:25.216 align:middle line:84%
So I think it's a much larger
process than we might imagine.

00:10:25.216 --> 00:10:27.090 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And that was
a very profound period

00:10:27.090 --> 00:10:28.700 align:middle line:90%
of time for contact, in general.

00:10:28.700 --> 00:10:31.360 align:middle line:84%
And let's pick it up with
President Eisenhower now

00:10:31.360 --> 00:10:34.810 align:middle line:84%
that we're into the '50s,
because that's fascinating.

00:10:34.810 --> 00:10:40.170 align:middle line:84%
>>GOOD: I think it's no
coincidence that 1955

00:10:40.170 --> 00:10:43.240 align:middle line:84%
was the point that
we were actually

00:10:43.240 --> 00:10:47.290 align:middle line:84%
close to blowing ourselves
up with hydrogen bombs.

00:10:47.290 --> 00:10:48.390 align:middle line:90%
[EXPLOSION]

00:10:48.390 --> 00:10:51.000 align:middle line:84%
There was a tit
for tat going on,

00:10:51.000 --> 00:10:54.980 align:middle line:84%
Russian tests of hydrogen
bombs, not atomic bombs,

00:10:54.980 --> 00:10:56.940 align:middle line:90%
and the Americans were doing it.

00:10:56.940 --> 00:11:03.882 align:middle line:84%
And the aliens said,
enough is enough

00:11:03.882 --> 00:11:05.870 align:middle line:84%
and they arranged
for this meeting

00:11:05.870 --> 00:11:12.660 align:middle line:84%
to take place at Holloman Air
Force Base in February of 1955.

00:11:12.660 --> 00:11:13.600 align:middle line:90%
And it did take place.

00:11:13.600 --> 00:11:17.730 align:middle line:84%
The only problem is we don't
have any information that's

00:11:17.730 --> 00:11:21.180 align:middle line:84%
available to me at any rate yet,
of what actually-- all I know,

00:11:21.180 --> 00:11:22.460 align:middle line:90%
it was a half hour meeting.

00:11:22.460 --> 00:11:24.769 align:middle line:84%
Eisenhower was taken
on board their saucer.

00:11:24.769 --> 00:11:25.310 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: OK.

00:11:25.310 --> 00:11:26.574 align:middle line:90%
Now let's back up a bit.

00:11:26.574 --> 00:11:27.490 align:middle line:90%
>>GOOD: Let's back up.

00:11:27.490 --> 00:11:27.780 align:middle line:90%
OK

00:11:27.780 --> 00:11:28.321 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: OK.

00:11:28.321 --> 00:11:31.400 align:middle line:84%
So Art Campbell did quite a
bit of research in this, right?

00:11:31.400 --> 00:11:33.740 align:middle line:84%
>>GOOD: Art Campbell did
tremendous amount of research

00:11:33.740 --> 00:11:34.520 align:middle line:90%
and let me use--

00:11:34.520 --> 00:11:36.800 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Tell the cover
story of it from Art said,

00:11:36.800 --> 00:11:39.069 align:middle line:84%
the cover story of
where Eisenhower

00:11:39.069 --> 00:11:41.360 align:middle line:84%
said he was going all the
way through to what happened.

00:11:41.360 --> 00:11:42.930 align:middle line:90%
>>GOOD: Yes.

00:11:42.930 --> 00:11:46.000 align:middle line:84%
Eisenhower made a
statement to the effect

00:11:46.000 --> 00:11:49.650 align:middle line:84%
that he was going for a
few days quail shooting

00:11:49.650 --> 00:11:57.365 align:middle line:84%
with the Treasury Secretary
and he'd be back fine.

00:11:57.365 --> 00:11:59.790 align:middle line:84%
And he took a whole
plane-load of people,

00:11:59.790 --> 00:12:03.260 align:middle line:84%
including Mamie, his wife,
and a lot of other people.

00:12:03.260 --> 00:12:07.320 align:middle line:84%
The plane went out there
and within a few hours,

00:12:07.320 --> 00:12:11.130 align:middle line:84%
a message went out that he'd
caught a case of the snuffles,

00:12:11.130 --> 00:12:15.110 align:middle line:84%
so he was going to go
to bed and sleep it

00:12:15.110 --> 00:12:16.760 align:middle line:90%
off overnight and everything.

00:12:16.760 --> 00:12:19.220 align:middle line:84%
In actual fact, he
flew in Air Force One

00:12:19.220 --> 00:12:22.330 align:middle line:84%
to Holloman Air Force
Base for this secret

00:12:22.330 --> 00:12:27.630 align:middle line:84%
arranged meeting with relatively
few people on board the plane.

00:12:27.630 --> 00:12:31.660 align:middle line:84%
Trusted people, like I
mentioned Leo Borrego, who

00:12:31.660 --> 00:12:35.000 align:middle line:90%
was one of the security guards.

00:12:35.000 --> 00:12:37.400 align:middle line:90%
He served several presidents.

00:12:37.400 --> 00:12:40.680 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And so he
went aboard a craft?

00:12:40.680 --> 00:12:42.170 align:middle line:90%
>>GOOD: Yes.

00:12:42.170 --> 00:12:44.420 align:middle line:84%
Unfortunately, we don't
know what was said.

00:12:44.420 --> 00:12:46.880 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: We only know as
evidence when he was leaving

00:12:46.880 --> 00:12:50.550 align:middle line:84%
office that he was fully aware
that some program had been

00:12:50.550 --> 00:12:52.990 align:middle line:84%
co-opted because of
his famous statement--

00:12:52.990 --> 00:12:55.073 align:middle line:84%
>>GOOD: Military industrial
speech and everything.

00:12:55.073 --> 00:12:57.350 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: -beware of the
military industrial complex.

00:12:57.350 --> 00:13:00.080 align:middle line:84%
So Art Campbell, of
course, he wasn't there.

00:13:00.080 --> 00:13:01.880 align:middle line:90%
So is that lost?

00:13:01.880 --> 00:13:03.840 align:middle line:84%
The knowledge of what
happened on board

00:13:03.840 --> 00:13:05.090 align:middle line:90%
that craft with the president?

00:13:05.090 --> 00:13:06.240 align:middle line:90%
>>GOOD: I doubt it.

00:13:06.240 --> 00:13:12.450 align:middle line:84%
I'm trying to think of a
retiring American source.

00:13:12.450 --> 00:13:14.710 align:middle line:84%
He's in my book, I've
just forgotten his name,

00:13:14.710 --> 00:13:20.960 align:middle line:84%
who came out just about a year
and a half ago with information

00:13:20.960 --> 00:13:24.010 align:middle line:84%
saying that he'd seen top
secret documents relating

00:13:24.010 --> 00:13:29.410 align:middle line:84%
to Eisenhower's meetings,
plural, with extraterrestrials.

00:13:29.410 --> 00:13:33.530 align:middle line:84%
Because we know there
were two in 1954

00:13:33.530 --> 00:13:36.380 align:middle line:84%
at what used to be
called Muroc Airfield.

00:13:36.380 --> 00:13:38.020 align:middle line:90%
It's now Edwards Air Force Base.

00:13:38.020 --> 00:13:41.170 align:middle line:84%
In fact, a year or so
afterwards it was called,

00:13:41.170 --> 00:13:43.570 align:middle line:90%
I think, Edwards Air Force Base.

00:13:43.570 --> 00:13:46.540 align:middle line:84%
And Eisenhower had at
least one meeting there,

00:13:46.540 --> 00:13:50.390 align:middle line:84%
which was attended by a number
of distinguished people,

00:13:50.390 --> 00:13:54.610 align:middle line:84%
an archbishop of Los Angeles,
and all sorts of people

00:13:54.610 --> 00:13:55.430 align:middle line:90%
were there.

00:13:55.430 --> 00:14:00.059 align:middle line:84%
And I have reproduced the
actual documents in my book

00:14:00.059 --> 00:14:02.600 align:middle line:84%
where he gives the names of some
of the people who were there

00:14:02.600 --> 00:14:05.330 align:middle line:84%
with him, quite
high ranking people.

00:14:05.330 --> 00:14:11.060 align:middle line:84%
And there was another meeting
either at that same Air Force

00:14:11.060 --> 00:14:12.620 align:middle line:90%
base or somewhere else.

00:14:12.620 --> 00:14:14.980 align:middle line:84%
I'm not absolutely
quite sure, but there

00:14:14.980 --> 00:14:16.670 align:middle line:90%
was a lot going on at that time.

00:14:16.670 --> 00:14:20.610 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Now what about after
when Kennedy came into office,

00:14:20.610 --> 00:14:24.760 align:middle line:84%
because there are a lot of
different stories about Kennedy

00:14:24.760 --> 00:14:26.700 align:middle line:84%
wanting to be more on
a need to know basis.

00:14:26.700 --> 00:14:27.940 align:middle line:84%
And then there were
certain events--

00:14:27.940 --> 00:14:28.898 align:middle line:90%
>>GOOD: That's correct.

00:14:28.898 --> 00:14:33.870 align:middle line:84%
My information is that the
controversial guy, George

00:14:33.870 --> 00:14:36.830 align:middle line:84%
Adamski, who is much
maligned, actually

00:14:36.830 --> 00:14:39.920 align:middle line:84%
had a US government ordinance
pass, which gave him clearance

00:14:39.920 --> 00:14:43.760 align:middle line:84%
to all military bases throughout
the world, all United States

00:14:43.760 --> 00:14:44.470 align:middle line:90%
military bases.

00:14:44.470 --> 00:14:44.940 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: So I understand.

00:14:44.940 --> 00:14:47.540 align:middle line:84%
>>GOOD: He also had clearance
to go to the White House

00:14:47.540 --> 00:14:50.230 align:middle line:84%
at any time, where
he met Kennedy.

00:14:50.230 --> 00:14:52.830 align:middle line:84%
I think he met other
presidents as well.

00:14:52.830 --> 00:14:54.460 align:middle line:84%
And he certainly
went to the Vatican

00:14:54.460 --> 00:14:56.682 align:middle line:90%
on probably three occasions.

00:14:56.682 --> 00:14:58.890 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Actually, I held
the coin in my hand today.

00:14:58.890 --> 00:15:01.204 align:middle line:84%
Glenn let me have the
coin that Adamski--

00:15:01.204 --> 00:15:02.120 align:middle line:90%
>>GOOD: How wonderful.

00:15:02.120 --> 00:15:02.230 align:middle line:90%
How wonderful.

00:15:02.230 --> 00:15:03.660 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: -used to carry.

00:15:03.660 --> 00:15:04.295 align:middle line:90%
It was amazing.

00:15:04.295 --> 00:15:05.045 align:middle line:90%
>>GOOD: I hope I see that too.

00:15:05.045 --> 00:15:05.795 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Ask him.

00:15:05.795 --> 00:15:06.460 align:middle line:90%
He's here.

00:15:06.460 --> 00:15:07.542 align:middle line:90%
He'll show it to you.

00:15:07.542 --> 00:15:08.030 align:middle line:90%
It's in his pocket.

00:15:08.030 --> 00:15:09.655 align:middle line:84%
>>GOOD: Such a shame
I've got to leave.

00:15:09.655 --> 00:15:11.160 align:middle line:90%
But anyway, we digress.

00:15:11.160 --> 00:15:12.500 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: We digress.

00:15:12.500 --> 00:15:13.880 align:middle line:90%
And so he met with the pope.

00:15:13.880 --> 00:15:14.838 align:middle line:90%
He met with presidents.

00:15:14.838 --> 00:15:17.280 align:middle line:84%
>>GOOD: He met with
Pope John 23rd twice,

00:15:17.280 --> 00:15:20.950 align:middle line:84%
and it was a private meeting and
the Pope gave him that medal.

00:15:20.950 --> 00:15:22.710 align:middle line:84%
Earlier than that,
I think it was--

00:15:22.710 --> 00:15:24.644 align:middle line:84%
I forget which
Pope it was, Pious.

00:15:24.644 --> 00:15:26.810 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Do we know the
nature of his conversations

00:15:26.810 --> 00:15:28.650 align:middle line:84%
at all with Kennedy
or any of the others?

00:15:28.650 --> 00:15:30.330 align:middle line:90%
>>GOOD: No, we don't.

00:15:30.330 --> 00:15:35.810 align:middle line:84%
All we know is that Adamski
arranged for Kennedy

00:15:35.810 --> 00:15:39.020 align:middle line:84%
to be taken on board one of
the large cigar-shaped craft,

00:15:39.020 --> 00:15:40.430 align:middle line:90%
and that was arranged.

00:15:40.430 --> 00:15:44.150 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Is that documented
somewhere in some classified

00:15:44.150 --> 00:15:45.150 align:middle line:90%
file?

00:15:45.150 --> 00:15:46.290 align:middle line:90%
>>GOOD: I would think so.

00:15:46.290 --> 00:15:48.140 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: See, now
that I wasn't aware of.

00:15:48.140 --> 00:15:49.860 align:middle line:90%
I wasn't aware of that.

00:15:49.860 --> 00:15:50.590 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:15:50.590 --> 00:15:53.320 align:middle line:84%
Well, Adamski seems to
have been really key.

00:15:53.320 --> 00:15:56.900 align:middle line:84%
And as I said to Glenn
Steckling when we were talking,

00:15:56.900 --> 00:16:00.340 align:middle line:84%
there's something about
just looking at Adamski,

00:16:00.340 --> 00:16:02.920 align:middle line:84%
just looking at his picture
before I even knew anything

00:16:02.920 --> 00:16:03.540 align:middle line:90%
about the man.

00:16:03.540 --> 00:16:04.370 align:middle line:84%
>>GOOD: Something
about him, isn't there?

00:16:04.370 --> 00:16:05.911 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: There's
something about him

00:16:05.911 --> 00:16:07.770 align:middle line:84%
that has this grace
that's hard to describe.

00:16:07.770 --> 00:16:10.380 align:middle line:90%
There's an extra quality to him.

00:16:10.380 --> 00:16:13.190 align:middle line:84%
And so it appears he
was highly influential

00:16:13.190 --> 00:16:15.150 align:middle line:84%
behind the scenes
for many, many years.

00:16:15.150 --> 00:16:15.890 align:middle line:90%
>>GOOD: Yeah.

00:16:15.890 --> 00:16:19.700 align:middle line:10%
And my frustration was that I
was supposed to be meeting him

00:16:19.700 --> 00:16:24.160 align:middle line:10%
in 1963, I was touring with the
Royal Philharmonic Orchestra,

00:16:24.160 --> 00:16:27.800 align:middle line:10%
and it was weird
actually in a way.

00:16:27.800 --> 00:16:29.080 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Why?

00:16:29.080 --> 00:16:31.270 align:middle line:84%
>>GOOD: I never got to
meet him, but before we

00:16:31.270 --> 00:16:34.810 align:middle line:84%
go to Los Angeles,
we were in a convoy

00:16:34.810 --> 00:16:37.710 align:middle line:84%
of 3 coaches, the orchestra,
from Tucson to Los Angeles.

00:16:37.710 --> 00:16:41.350 align:middle line:84%
I think it's about 500
and something miles.

00:16:41.350 --> 00:16:42.860 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: It's a distance, yes.

00:16:42.860 --> 00:16:49.340 align:middle line:84%
>>GOOD: And we had a
cafe stop for an hour.

00:16:49.340 --> 00:16:52.260 align:middle line:84%
And I was wondering whether
I would get the chance

00:16:52.260 --> 00:16:53.800 align:middle line:84%
to see Adamski and
I thought, what

00:16:53.800 --> 00:16:55.850 align:middle line:84%
about our rehearsal
schedule and I

00:16:55.850 --> 00:16:58.160 align:middle line:84%
had to go up to the
Palomar and everything.

00:16:58.160 --> 00:17:00.920 align:middle line:90%
I was worrying about it all.

00:17:00.920 --> 00:17:03.570 align:middle line:84%
Anyway, we sat down
in this restaurant

00:17:03.570 --> 00:17:07.920 align:middle line:84%
and I was with three of my
colleagues in a sort of corner

00:17:07.920 --> 00:17:10.200 align:middle line:84%
area, but not far
from the line, and I

00:17:10.200 --> 00:17:13.810 align:middle line:84%
saw waiting in line--
I was alerted a very

00:17:13.810 --> 00:17:18.010 align:middle line:84%
petite girl, very
attractive, but very,

00:17:18.010 --> 00:17:24.040 align:middle line:84%
very calm and difficult
to describe really.

00:17:24.040 --> 00:17:27.359 align:middle line:90%
Very, very collected.

00:17:27.359 --> 00:17:29.590 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: That extra
presence of grace?

00:17:29.590 --> 00:17:30.800 align:middle line:90%
>>GOOD: Yes.

00:17:30.800 --> 00:17:32.520 align:middle line:84%
Sort of like a
ballet dancer almost,

00:17:32.520 --> 00:17:36.890 align:middle line:90%
but she wasn't very tall.

00:17:36.890 --> 00:17:39.650 align:middle line:84%
And in my mind I thought,
you're one of them.

00:17:39.650 --> 00:17:41.940 align:middle line:84%
So I sent out the thought,
if you're from elsewhere,

00:17:41.940 --> 00:17:47.010 align:middle line:84%
could you pass by my table
and give me some proof.

00:17:47.010 --> 00:17:50.740 align:middle line:84%
She came to my table with
a deadpan look on her face.

00:17:50.740 --> 00:17:52.450 align:middle line:90%
And then she went.

00:17:52.450 --> 00:17:55.140 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Is that what you
asked her to do telepathically?

00:17:55.140 --> 00:17:56.070 align:middle line:90%
>>GOOD: Not--

00:17:56.070 --> 00:17:56.700 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: You just
said to give--

00:17:56.700 --> 00:17:56.870 align:middle line:90%
>>GOOD: -specifically.

00:17:56.870 --> 00:17:58.370 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: -her
something, a clue.

00:17:58.370 --> 00:17:59.910 align:middle line:90%
>>GOOD: To give me some.

00:17:59.910 --> 00:18:00.826 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: How amazing.

00:18:00.826 --> 00:18:04.699 align:middle line:84%
>>GOOD: And my colleague said,
what's that all about, Tim?

00:18:04.699 --> 00:18:05.990 align:middle line:90%
Where did you pick her up from?

00:18:05.990 --> 00:18:07.375 align:middle line:90%
And I said, I don't know.

00:18:07.375 --> 00:18:09.940 align:middle line:84%
And when she left, it was a
completely deadpan expression,

00:18:09.940 --> 00:18:11.110 align:middle line:84%
I realized that
was the end of it.

00:18:11.110 --> 00:18:12.901 align:middle line:84%
She went to another
part of the restaurant.

00:18:12.901 --> 00:18:16.000 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: You know, I've
heard that there are many,

00:18:16.000 --> 00:18:17.890 align:middle line:84%
many of these beings
walking among us.

00:18:17.890 --> 00:18:21.370 align:middle line:84%
Have you ever heard a
number, like a general number

00:18:21.370 --> 00:18:23.320 align:middle line:84%
of how many of
these beings might

00:18:23.320 --> 00:18:25.170 align:middle line:84%
be walking among us
at any given time?

00:18:25.170 --> 00:18:26.680 align:middle line:90%
>>GOOD: I don't know.

00:18:26.680 --> 00:18:29.380 align:middle line:84%
Probably more than
we could guess.

00:18:29.380 --> 00:18:32.750 align:middle line:84%
But my second
experience was in 1967,

00:18:32.750 --> 00:18:35.383 align:middle line:84%
when I was working-- I was
then with the London Symphony

00:18:35.383 --> 00:18:37.591 align:middle line:84%
Orchestra, as member of the
London Symphony Orchestra

00:18:37.591 --> 00:18:38.520 align:middle line:90%
by that time.

00:18:38.520 --> 00:18:42.910 align:middle line:84%
And we were staying at the Park
Sheraton Hotel in New York.

00:18:42.910 --> 00:18:46.030 align:middle line:84%
I think it's off of 7th
Avenue, not far from Carnegie,

00:18:46.030 --> 00:18:50.280 align:middle line:84%
where we were doing a week's
concertizing with Rostropovich

00:18:50.280 --> 00:18:52.010 align:middle line:90%
as a cellist.

00:18:52.010 --> 00:18:55.247 align:middle line:84%
And one afternoon, I sort of
thought, you know, why, not?

00:18:55.247 --> 00:18:57.830 align:middle line:84%
Why don't I sort of sit down in
the lobby of the Park Sheraton

00:18:57.830 --> 00:18:59.630 align:middle line:84%
and send out a
telepathic message.

00:18:59.630 --> 00:19:01.750 align:middle line:84%
If any of you guys in
the New York district

00:19:01.750 --> 00:19:05.430 align:middle line:84%
come down or whatever
and prove it to me,

00:19:05.430 --> 00:19:10.640 align:middle line:84%
come by, drop by,
words to that effect.

00:19:10.640 --> 00:19:13.620 align:middle line:84%
So I sent out that thought
and after about half an hour,

00:19:13.620 --> 00:19:16.430 align:middle line:84%
I thought this is ridiculous
nothing's happening.

00:19:16.430 --> 00:19:20.190 align:middle line:84%
But eventually it could've
been 40 minutes, 35, 40 minutes

00:19:20.190 --> 00:19:23.200 align:middle line:84%
after I'd sent out
the thought, a man

00:19:23.200 --> 00:19:28.410 align:middle line:84%
came in, immaculately dressed,
pale olive complexion,

00:19:28.410 --> 00:19:32.779 align:middle line:84%
pale bluish greenish eyes, a
very, very straight-forward

00:19:32.779 --> 00:19:33.320 align:middle line:90%
looking chap.

00:19:33.320 --> 00:19:36.690 align:middle line:84%
He didn't really smile
or frown or anything,

00:19:36.690 --> 00:19:39.360 align:middle line:90%
very self-possessed.

00:19:39.360 --> 00:19:43.860 align:middle line:84%
And he then came and sat
down beside me on the sofa,

00:19:43.860 --> 00:19:46.760 align:middle line:84%
but leaving a space
in between, he

00:19:46.760 --> 00:19:48.430 align:middle line:90%
didn't come right close to me.

00:19:48.430 --> 00:19:51.071 align:middle line:84%
He then had an attache
case, and everything he did

00:19:51.071 --> 00:19:52.070 align:middle line:90%
was slow and deliberate.

00:19:52.070 --> 00:19:55.180 align:middle line:84%
He opened the attache
case, then he pulled out

00:19:55.180 --> 00:19:57.380 align:middle line:84%
the "New York
Times," opened it up

00:19:57.380 --> 00:20:01.020 align:middle line:84%
and he went through
the pages like this.

00:20:01.020 --> 00:20:04.074 align:middle line:84%
Just went through the whole
paper, folded it in two,

00:20:04.074 --> 00:20:06.240 align:middle line:84%
put it back in his attache
case, and just sat there.

00:20:06.240 --> 00:20:07.930 align:middle line:84%
So I thought, right,
now's the time.

00:20:07.930 --> 00:20:10.750 align:middle line:84%
So in my mind, I said,
if you're the guy

00:20:10.750 --> 00:20:13.239 align:middle line:84%
I'm looking for take
your right index finger

00:20:13.239 --> 00:20:15.780 align:middle line:84%
and hold it to the right side
of your nose and keep it there.

00:20:15.780 --> 00:20:16.821 align:middle line:90%
And immediately he went--

00:20:16.821 --> 00:20:20.139 align:middle line:90%


00:20:20.139 --> 00:20:20.740 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Wow.

00:20:20.740 --> 00:20:23.570 align:middle line:84%
>>GOOD: Then I thought--
people say, why don't you

00:20:23.570 --> 00:20:25.080 align:middle line:90%
talk to them, Tim?

00:20:25.080 --> 00:20:28.300 align:middle line:84%
And I just didn't feel
it was appropriate.

00:20:28.300 --> 00:20:29.494 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: You British.

00:20:29.494 --> 00:20:30.410 align:middle line:90%
An American would've--

00:20:30.410 --> 00:20:30.670 align:middle line:90%
>>GOOD: Of course.

00:20:30.670 --> 00:20:31.169 align:middle line:90%
Of course.

00:20:31.169 --> 00:20:32.460 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: -burst off.

00:20:32.460 --> 00:20:35.440 align:middle line:84%
So nothing came of it
and eventually he got up,

00:20:35.440 --> 00:20:37.770 align:middle line:84%
just looked at me in
a very pleasant way.

00:20:37.770 --> 00:20:42.124 align:middle line:84%
And then he went off out onto
7th Avenue, or wherever it was.

00:20:42.124 --> 00:20:44.415 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: What did this do
to your life from that point

00:20:44.415 --> 00:20:44.915 align:middle line:90%
forward?

00:20:44.915 --> 00:20:47.330 align:middle line:84%
>>GOOD: It convinced me that
there are these guys around

00:20:47.330 --> 00:20:49.370 align:middle line:84%
and that they are
communicating with us.

00:20:49.370 --> 00:20:53.384 align:middle line:84%
And then there was
another occasion,

00:20:53.384 --> 00:20:54.800 align:middle line:84%
which I've written
up in the book.

00:20:54.800 --> 00:20:56.650 align:middle line:84%
I've written all three
cases or experiences.

00:20:56.650 --> 00:20:58.025 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: What
was the third one?

00:20:58.025 --> 00:21:00.540 align:middle line:84%
>>GOOD: Third one, without
having the book in front of me,

00:21:00.540 --> 00:21:03.206 align:middle line:84%
I can't remember the exact date,
but it was about nine years ago

00:21:03.206 --> 00:21:05.200 align:middle line:90%
in Vrotslav in Poland.

00:21:05.200 --> 00:21:08.980 align:middle line:84%
I was the guest of honor at a
prestigious debating society,

00:21:08.980 --> 00:21:12.510 align:middle line:84%
Professor Dudek's
Salon it was called.

00:21:12.510 --> 00:21:18.400 align:middle line:84%
And I was the special guest
and it was the first time

00:21:18.400 --> 00:21:21.190 align:middle line:84%
they'd dealt with the dreaded
subject of UFOs and there was

00:21:21.190 --> 00:21:24.220 align:middle line:90%
a lot of sort of...

00:21:24.220 --> 00:21:27.160 align:middle line:90%


00:21:27.160 --> 00:21:31.580 align:middle line:84%
not dismay so much as disgust
even that the subject of UFOs

00:21:31.580 --> 00:21:35.230 align:middle line:84%
would be brought up in a
prestigious debating salon.

00:21:35.230 --> 00:21:37.170 align:middle line:84%
Anyway, there were
about I should

00:21:37.170 --> 00:21:40.550 align:middle line:90%
think 70 to 80 people there.

00:21:40.550 --> 00:21:41.560 align:middle line:90%
I was the first person.

00:21:41.560 --> 00:21:44.650 align:middle line:84%
I presented a slide show for
35 minutes and that was that.

00:21:44.650 --> 00:21:46.920 align:middle line:90%
Then there was a break.

00:21:46.920 --> 00:21:50.610 align:middle line:84%
After the break, I think it
was a good half hour's break,

00:21:50.610 --> 00:21:52.370 align:middle line:84%
and people could then
come forward and say

00:21:52.370 --> 00:21:54.203 align:middle line:84%
what they wanted in
front of the mic, though

00:21:54.203 --> 00:21:57.110 align:middle line:84%
couldn't be more than 5, 6, 7
minutes, something like that.

00:21:57.110 --> 00:22:01.030 align:middle line:84%
Anyway, I had been noticing
someone sitting not more

00:22:01.030 --> 00:22:03.340 align:middle line:84%
than about 10 feet,
12 feet away from me,

00:22:03.340 --> 00:22:06.560 align:middle line:84%
who I thought was very similar
to the guy in New York,

00:22:06.560 --> 00:22:08.500 align:middle line:90%
but slimmer.

00:22:08.500 --> 00:22:09.920 align:middle line:90%
And I thought, right.

00:22:09.920 --> 00:22:12.610 align:middle line:84%
I think you're one
of them, you see.

00:22:12.610 --> 00:22:16.410 align:middle line:84%
People say, Tim, why didn't you
take photographs of these guys?

00:22:16.410 --> 00:22:19.270 align:middle line:84%
And I thought, oh, I'll try
and get a picture of him.

00:22:19.270 --> 00:22:22.170 align:middle line:84%
So I had a Minox
camera, which is

00:22:22.170 --> 00:22:26.330 align:middle line:84%
suitable for sort of
discrete photography.

00:22:26.330 --> 00:22:31.390 align:middle line:84%
And I needed with that
camera to do three takes,

00:22:31.390 --> 00:22:33.870 align:middle line:90%
because of the size of the room.

00:22:33.870 --> 00:22:36.471 align:middle line:84%
So I went one side and
got some of the people

00:22:36.471 --> 00:22:37.970 align:middle line:84%
there, not everybody,
because people

00:22:37.970 --> 00:22:42.510 align:middle line:84%
were starting to come back for
the second half of the program.

00:22:42.510 --> 00:22:44.680 align:middle line:84%
And I went to the
middle section,

00:22:44.680 --> 00:22:47.190 align:middle line:90%
I took a picture there.

00:22:47.190 --> 00:22:50.670 align:middle line:84%
And then I went to take a
picture of where the guy was,

00:22:50.670 --> 00:22:53.170 align:middle line:90%
and a voice came from nowhere.

00:22:53.170 --> 00:22:55.975 align:middle line:84%
"The speaker is not allowed
to take photographs."

00:22:55.975 --> 00:22:56.810 align:middle line:90%
And I looked.

00:22:56.810 --> 00:22:59.680 align:middle line:84%
And to this day, I have
no idea who said that.

00:22:59.680 --> 00:23:03.800 align:middle line:84%
I said, oh, I'm terribly
sorry to whatever it was.

00:23:03.800 --> 00:23:05.100 align:middle line:90%
So that was that.

00:23:05.100 --> 00:23:06.260 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: No pictures.

00:23:06.260 --> 00:23:08.010 align:middle line:84%
Did you ask him
to do another one

00:23:08.010 --> 00:23:10.617 align:middle line:84%
of these identifications
of sorts?

00:23:10.617 --> 00:23:11.200 align:middle line:90%
>>GOOD: I did.

00:23:11.200 --> 00:23:13.390 align:middle line:84%
It was absolutely
no response at all.

00:23:13.390 --> 00:23:15.015 align:middle line:90%
But it gets more interesting.

00:23:15.015 --> 00:23:18.509 align:middle line:90%


00:23:18.509 --> 00:23:20.425 align:middle line:84%
In fact, there was a
professional photographer

00:23:20.425 --> 00:23:22.160 align:middle line:90%
there, I should point that out.

00:23:22.160 --> 00:23:26.910 align:middle line:84%
And I had a Polish interpreter
on my shoulder practically,

00:23:26.910 --> 00:23:30.150 align:middle line:84%
because sometimes you need
simultaneous translation when

00:23:30.150 --> 00:23:34.100 align:middle line:84%
some people don't-- I mean,
there were two Polish Air Force

00:23:34.100 --> 00:23:36.345 align:middle line:84%
pilots there, quite high
ranking one of them,

00:23:36.345 --> 00:23:38.719 align:middle line:84%
and they were arguing with
the people who were rubbishing

00:23:38.719 --> 00:23:42.800 align:middle line:84%
the subject saying things-- the
psychiatrists and psychologists

00:23:42.800 --> 00:23:45.966 align:middle line:84%
were saying, it's outrageous
we have this discussion here.

00:23:45.966 --> 00:23:48.240 align:middle line:84%
At which point, one
of the pilots, major,

00:23:48.240 --> 00:23:50.740 align:middle line:84%
stood up and said, you don't
know what you're talking about.

00:23:50.740 --> 00:23:53.277 align:middle line:84%
We're the guys who have
to deal with these things.

00:23:53.277 --> 00:23:55.110 align:middle line:84%
And then he pointed to
his friend next door,

00:23:55.110 --> 00:23:58.750 align:middle line:84%
who'd actually been
chased by a UFO.

00:23:58.750 --> 00:24:02.380 align:middle line:84%
I think he'd tried
taking a potshot at it.

00:24:02.380 --> 00:24:03.710 align:middle line:90%
That was quite interesting.

00:24:03.710 --> 00:24:07.140 align:middle line:90%


00:24:07.140 --> 00:24:10.990 align:middle line:84%
Let's cut to the end
of the whole evening.

00:24:10.990 --> 00:24:12.640 align:middle line:84%
People were coming
up to the microphone

00:24:12.640 --> 00:24:18.660 align:middle line:84%
giving their five minute
statement or contribution

00:24:18.660 --> 00:24:20.490 align:middle line:90%
to the debate, whatever.

00:24:20.490 --> 00:24:26.090 align:middle line:84%
The last person to do that
was this strange person,

00:24:26.090 --> 00:24:30.410 align:middle line:84%
and the subject of
his-- I can't tell you

00:24:30.410 --> 00:24:35.660 align:middle line:84%
how long it went on, I'll
come to that in a minute--

00:24:35.660 --> 00:24:40.890 align:middle line:84%
but it was about
Earth's future in space.

00:24:40.890 --> 00:24:43.180 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And he spoke
with authority on this?

00:24:43.180 --> 00:24:44.804 align:middle line:84%
>>GOOD: And he was
speaking in English.

00:24:44.804 --> 00:24:45.400 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

00:24:45.400 --> 00:24:48.270 align:middle line:84%
And I listened to
it and I thought,

00:24:48.270 --> 00:24:49.551 align:middle line:90%
this is absolutely fantastic.

00:24:49.551 --> 00:24:51.550 align:middle line:84%
I've got to talk to this
guy when he's finished.

00:24:51.550 --> 00:24:57.240 align:middle line:84%
So everything closed down for
the evening about 11 o'clock.

00:24:57.240 --> 00:24:59.870 align:middle line:90%


00:24:59.870 --> 00:25:03.970 align:middle line:84%
And he sort of walked
towards me, and I thought,

00:25:03.970 --> 00:25:06.400 align:middle line:84%
I'm going to try and shake
his hand or something.

00:25:06.400 --> 00:25:11.660 align:middle line:84%
So I put out my hand towards him
and-- you can be me, all right?

00:25:11.660 --> 00:25:14.970 align:middle line:84%
I'm the alien and you're
going to shake my hand.

00:25:14.970 --> 00:25:15.470 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:25:15.470 --> 00:25:18.520 align:middle line:90%


00:25:18.520 --> 00:25:21.420 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Oh, just like that.

00:25:21.420 --> 00:25:22.281 align:middle line:90%
Whoa.

00:25:22.281 --> 00:25:22.780 align:middle line:90%
Interesting.

00:25:22.780 --> 00:25:24.100 align:middle line:90%
>>GOOD: No blink.

00:25:24.100 --> 00:25:25.440 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: And no grasping?

00:25:25.440 --> 00:25:26.000 align:middle line:90%
Just a--

00:25:26.000 --> 00:25:26.666 align:middle line:90%
>>GOOD: Nothing.

00:25:26.666 --> 00:25:28.230 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: -straight
touch, that's it.

00:25:28.230 --> 00:25:29.896 align:middle line:84%
>>GOOD: And I gave
him my business card,

00:25:29.896 --> 00:25:33.510 align:middle line:84%
and I said to him, I think you
have a great deal of knowledge.

00:25:33.510 --> 00:25:38.400 align:middle line:84%
And he didn't smile, he didn't
say thank you or anything

00:25:38.400 --> 00:25:39.890 align:middle line:90%
and he went away.

00:25:39.890 --> 00:25:42.940 align:middle line:84%
Then it was time for
us all to go home.

00:25:42.940 --> 00:25:46.840 align:middle line:84%
And I don't know-- I was
just in a party of about 15

00:25:46.840 --> 00:25:49.880 align:middle line:84%
because I was being put up at
a converted Polish castle where

00:25:49.880 --> 00:25:51.850 align:middle line:84%
they had a restaurant
and a hotel,

00:25:51.850 --> 00:25:54.160 align:middle line:90%
and having a wonderful time.

00:25:54.160 --> 00:25:56.500 align:middle line:84%
And I think there was a
total of about 10 of us

00:25:56.500 --> 00:26:00.680 align:middle line:84%
all together in a group,
so we got into about 2 cars

00:26:00.680 --> 00:26:03.590 align:middle line:84%
and then went back to the--
and in the car on the way back,

00:26:03.590 --> 00:26:07.566 align:middle line:84%
I said, who's that guy that
gave the last presentation?

00:26:07.566 --> 00:26:09.440 align:middle line:84%
And they said, oh yes,
he's very interesting.

00:26:09.440 --> 00:26:11.273 align:middle line:84%
He's always got something
interesting to say

00:26:11.273 --> 00:26:12.500 align:middle line:90%
about any subject.

00:26:12.500 --> 00:26:13.710 align:middle line:90%
Oh yes, OK.

00:26:13.710 --> 00:26:15.811 align:middle line:90%
I said, what did he talk about?

00:26:15.811 --> 00:26:18.060 align:middle line:84%
And they said, oh, it's about
Earth's future in space.

00:26:18.060 --> 00:26:20.000 align:middle line:84%
I said yes, but what
did he talk about?

00:26:20.000 --> 00:26:22.330 align:middle line:90%
What did he say?

00:26:22.330 --> 00:26:23.210 align:middle line:90%
Gone.

00:26:23.210 --> 00:26:25.800 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: No one could remember.

00:26:25.800 --> 00:26:27.290 align:middle line:90%
>>GOOD: Wiped.

00:26:27.290 --> 00:26:30.650 align:middle line:84%
So then I thought,
well, in my contract,

00:26:30.650 --> 00:26:35.467 align:middle line:84%
it said the speaker is due
to get an audio of the event.

00:26:35.467 --> 00:26:37.300 align:middle line:84%
There was a professional
photographer there.

00:26:37.300 --> 00:26:41.710 align:middle line:84%
He's supposed to get photographs
of the people that were there,

00:26:41.710 --> 00:26:43.510 align:middle line:90%
and it goes on and on.

00:26:43.510 --> 00:26:48.941 align:middle line:84%
Could I get the audio that I was
supposed to have by contract?

00:26:48.941 --> 00:26:49.440 align:middle line:90%
No.

00:26:49.440 --> 00:26:51.680 align:middle line:84%
Could I get any photographs
from the photographer,

00:26:51.680 --> 00:26:55.050 align:middle line:84%
as I was supposed by
contract to have photographs?

00:26:55.050 --> 00:26:56.230 align:middle line:90%
Nothing.

00:26:56.230 --> 00:26:59.050 align:middle line:84%
Could I get in touch
with Professor Dudek?

00:26:59.050 --> 00:27:00.470 align:middle line:90%
No.

00:27:00.470 --> 00:27:01.560 align:middle line:90%
Nothing.

00:27:01.560 --> 00:27:02.722 align:middle line:90%
That was the end of it.

00:27:02.722 --> 00:27:03.638 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Interesting.

00:27:03.638 --> 00:27:05.596 align:middle line:84%
>>GOOD: So, that's
what happened.

00:27:05.596 --> 00:27:06.970 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Well,
that's wonderful.

00:27:06.970 --> 00:27:09.734 align:middle line:84%
That would certainly catapult
you forward into all of this.

00:27:09.734 --> 00:27:12.150 align:middle line:84%
And sometimes it's hiding,
it's all hiding in plain sight.

00:27:12.150 --> 00:27:14.190 align:middle line:84%
And one of the things
in your presentation

00:27:14.190 --> 00:27:16.230 align:middle line:84%
I found really
interesting was the fact

00:27:16.230 --> 00:27:19.520 align:middle line:84%
that National Inquirer had
done a very accurate and full

00:27:19.520 --> 00:27:21.312 align:middle line:90%
write-up on this in 1979.

00:27:21.312 --> 00:27:22.270 align:middle line:90%
Could you explain this?

00:27:22.270 --> 00:27:22.840 align:middle line:90%
>>GOOD: Yes.

00:27:22.840 --> 00:27:25.830 align:middle line:84%
Now Bo Pratt was
a friend of mine.

00:27:25.830 --> 00:27:28.200 align:middle line:84%
He was a very exceptionally
good journalist,

00:27:28.200 --> 00:27:30.380 align:middle line:90%
and he wrote at least one book.

00:27:30.380 --> 00:27:33.290 align:middle line:90%
He spoke Spanish very well.

00:27:33.290 --> 00:27:36.002 align:middle line:84%
He spent a lot of
time in Brazil,

00:27:36.002 --> 00:27:37.460 align:middle line:84%
not just for the
National Inquirer,

00:27:37.460 --> 00:27:40.160 align:middle line:84%
but on his own behalf because
there were some horrific things

00:27:40.160 --> 00:27:44.360 align:middle line:84%
that have been going
on with alien stuff

00:27:44.360 --> 00:27:48.930 align:middle line:90%
in the Brazilian jungle.

00:27:48.930 --> 00:27:50.650 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: I don't
know about that.

00:27:50.650 --> 00:27:52.860 align:middle line:84%
>>GOOD: Well,
there's been a lot.

00:27:52.860 --> 00:27:53.360 align:middle line:90%
A lot.

00:27:53.360 --> 00:27:54.484 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: You say horrific?

00:27:54.484 --> 00:27:57.480 align:middle line:84%
>>GOOD: People chased up
trees and things and scarred

00:27:57.480 --> 00:27:58.830 align:middle line:90%
and threatened.

00:27:58.830 --> 00:28:04.170 align:middle line:84%
I mean, a lot of stuff, horrific
stuff, really frightening.

00:28:04.170 --> 00:28:07.740 align:middle line:84%
And to the extent that they
had to send in a Brazilian Air

00:28:07.740 --> 00:28:10.470 align:middle line:84%
Force intelligence team and
they spent a long time there

00:28:10.470 --> 00:28:11.850 align:middle line:84%
and they all had
encounters, they

00:28:11.850 --> 00:28:15.470 align:middle line:84%
all saw these craft
regularly, different types.

00:28:15.470 --> 00:28:16.707 align:middle line:90%
And--

00:28:16.707 --> 00:28:18.790 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: It's one of the
hot spots on the planet.

00:28:18.790 --> 00:28:21.122 align:middle line:84%
We know that just
from sightings.

00:28:21.122 --> 00:28:23.330 align:middle line:84%
I didn't know about the
horrific parts in the jungle.

00:28:23.330 --> 00:28:27.184 align:middle line:84%
>>GOOD: So Bob Pratt told me
that the extraordinary thing

00:28:27.184 --> 00:28:29.350 align:middle line:84%
about the National Inquirer
was, well, first of all,

00:28:29.350 --> 00:28:31.250 align:middle line:90%
it was owned by the CIA.

00:28:31.250 --> 00:28:33.890 align:middle line:84%
Secondly he said,
the amazing thing

00:28:33.890 --> 00:28:38.860 align:middle line:84%
is that the articles
that we send

00:28:38.860 --> 00:28:41.140 align:middle line:84%
in-- all of us,
different people.

00:28:41.140 --> 00:28:44.390 align:middle line:84%
Bob Pratt might have shared
an article with someone else.

00:28:44.390 --> 00:28:47.260 align:middle line:84%
It was exactly--
nothing was changed.

00:28:47.260 --> 00:28:51.550 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And the subject
of that article in '79?

00:28:51.550 --> 00:28:54.950 align:middle line:84%
>>GOOD: I think it
was about-- which one?

00:28:54.950 --> 00:28:57.975 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: I think it was maybe
about Eisenhower, looking back.

00:28:57.975 --> 00:28:58.850 align:middle line:90%
>>GOOD: Oh, that one.

00:28:58.850 --> 00:28:59.985 align:middle line:90%
The National Inquirer.

00:28:59.985 --> 00:29:01.717 align:middle line:84%
That one also is
extremely accurate.

00:29:01.717 --> 00:29:02.300 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:29:02.300 --> 00:29:02.900 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

00:29:02.900 --> 00:29:06.600 align:middle line:84%
And the thing is, it's a rag,
and so was it set up by the--

00:29:06.600 --> 00:29:07.850 align:middle line:90%
>>GOOD: Hidden in plain sight.

00:29:07.850 --> 00:29:09.225 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: -hidden
in plain sight.

00:29:09.225 --> 00:29:10.459 align:middle line:90%
Was it set up that way?

00:29:10.459 --> 00:29:12.250 align:middle line:84%
Yes, they're getting
accurate information--

00:29:12.250 --> 00:29:13.083 align:middle line:90%
>>GOOD: I expect so.

00:29:13.083 --> 00:29:14.868 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: -to begin
the ridicule factor?

00:29:14.868 --> 00:29:16.204 align:middle line:90%
>>GOOD: I don't know.

00:29:16.204 --> 00:29:17.620 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Isn't
that interesting--

00:29:17.620 --> 00:29:19.940 align:middle line:84%
>>GOOD: But it's very
easy to ridicule it.

00:29:19.940 --> 00:29:21.940 align:middle line:84%
But all I know is
that everything

00:29:21.940 --> 00:29:24.060 align:middle line:84%
was printed
absolutely accurately

00:29:24.060 --> 00:29:27.550 align:middle line:84%
according to what the reporters
had given in their copy.

00:29:27.550 --> 00:29:32.842 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: We have only time
for a couple more questions.

00:29:32.842 --> 00:29:34.550 align:middle line:84%
Well, this isn't even
a question, really.

00:29:34.550 --> 00:29:36.730 align:middle line:90%
It has to do with Ben Rich.

00:29:36.730 --> 00:29:38.800 align:middle line:84%
And when you were
talking today, you

00:29:38.800 --> 00:29:41.180 align:middle line:84%
were giving the
famous quote, which

00:29:41.180 --> 00:29:43.150 align:middle line:84%
anyone who's been hanging
out in this community

00:29:43.150 --> 00:29:46.670 align:middle line:84%
as I have for a long time,
is familiar with this,

00:29:46.670 --> 00:29:48.920 align:middle line:84%
but the public and some
of our viewers may not be.

00:29:48.920 --> 00:29:50.460 align:middle line:90%
But it's important to hear this.

00:29:50.460 --> 00:29:55.490 align:middle line:84%
>>GOOD: This was during
an alumni meeting

00:29:55.490 --> 00:29:59.050 align:middle line:84%
at the University of
California in Los Angeles,

00:29:59.050 --> 00:30:03.240 align:middle line:84%
and they were alumni of
the engineering association

00:30:03.240 --> 00:30:05.620 align:middle line:90%
there in California.

00:30:05.620 --> 00:30:08.050 align:middle line:84%
And two friends of mine--
one of them, at least,

00:30:08.050 --> 00:30:13.170 align:middle line:84%
might be at this conference, I'm
not sure-- were alumni as well.

00:30:13.170 --> 00:30:14.799 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: For Americans, alumni.

00:30:14.799 --> 00:30:15.340 align:middle line:90%
>>GOOD: Yeah.

00:30:15.340 --> 00:30:15.890 align:middle line:90%
Alumni.

00:30:15.890 --> 00:30:16.500 align:middle line:90%
Oh, I'm sorry.

00:30:16.500 --> 00:30:17.080 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: No, it's fine.

00:30:17.080 --> 00:30:18.454 align:middle line:84%
That's the British
pronunciation.

00:30:18.454 --> 00:30:20.280 align:middle line:90%
>>GOOD: Alumni, OK.

00:30:20.280 --> 00:30:23.540 align:middle line:84%
And Ben Rich gave an
extraordinary presentation

00:30:23.540 --> 00:30:27.520 align:middle line:84%
and he actually said during
his presentation, now guys,

00:30:27.520 --> 00:30:29.870 align:middle line:84%
you know there are several
people from the Air Force

00:30:29.870 --> 00:30:33.587 align:middle line:90%
and the CIA present in his room.

00:30:33.587 --> 00:30:36.170 align:middle line:84%
He didn't say, I must be careful
what I say, because, in fact,

00:30:36.170 --> 00:30:37.910 align:middle line:90%
he wasn't.

00:30:37.910 --> 00:30:43.810 align:middle line:84%
And one of the last things
he said is an absolute gem.

00:30:43.810 --> 00:30:47.170 align:middle line:84%
Now bear in mind, this was at
the University of California

00:30:47.170 --> 00:30:52.770 align:middle line:84%
in Los Angeles in March of 1993,
which is quite a while back.

00:30:52.770 --> 00:30:57.500 align:middle line:84%
And during his presentation,
this is what he said.

00:30:57.500 --> 00:31:03.320 align:middle line:84%
"We already have the means
to travel among the stars,

00:31:03.320 --> 00:31:06.450 align:middle line:84%
but these technologies are
locked up in black projects

00:31:06.450 --> 00:31:11.410 align:middle line:84%
and it would take an act of
God to ever get them out.

00:31:11.410 --> 00:31:16.405 align:middle line:84%
Anything you can imagine,
we already know how to do."

00:31:16.405 --> 00:31:17.030 align:middle line:90%
How about that?

00:31:17.030 --> 00:31:18.167 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: That says it.

00:31:18.167 --> 00:31:19.500 align:middle line:90%
>>GOOD: Says it all, doesn't it?

00:31:19.500 --> 00:31:20.140 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: It does say it all.

00:31:20.140 --> 00:31:21.890 align:middle line:84%
And knowing what you
know-- and we've only

00:31:21.890 --> 00:31:24.270 align:middle line:84%
touched on a half a dozen
of many, many topics

00:31:24.270 --> 00:31:28.770 align:middle line:84%
here-- in short, for you, what
is, from everything you have

00:31:28.770 --> 00:31:31.380 align:middle line:84%
access to, the greatest
hope in all of this

00:31:31.380 --> 00:31:34.670 align:middle line:84%
and the greatest
concern in all of this?

00:31:34.670 --> 00:31:42.380 align:middle line:84%
>>GOOD: My greatest hope is
that via the Amicizia Project,

00:31:42.380 --> 00:31:44.780 align:middle line:84%
if you like, which took
place in many countries

00:31:44.780 --> 00:31:48.030 align:middle line:84%
around the world, involving
lots and lots of people,

00:31:48.030 --> 00:31:52.570 align:middle line:84%
they have been given an
insight into a more advanced

00:31:52.570 --> 00:31:53.640 align:middle line:90%
civilization.

00:31:53.640 --> 00:31:57.990 align:middle line:84%
A civilization
probably thousands

00:31:57.990 --> 00:32:00.190 align:middle line:90%
of years in advance of ours.

00:32:00.190 --> 00:32:03.750 align:middle line:84%
But the downside of that, as
it was admitted by the Amicizia

00:32:03.750 --> 00:32:05.720 align:middle line:84%
aliens themselves,
was that there

00:32:05.720 --> 00:32:10.840 align:middle line:84%
are others, who they had to
deal with-- they called them

00:32:10.840 --> 00:32:16.620 align:middle line:84%
the Contrari in Italian-- the
ones that they were-- they

00:32:16.620 --> 00:32:17.670 align:middle line:90%
fought together.

00:32:17.670 --> 00:32:20.310 align:middle line:84%
I mean, there were all sorts of
extraordinary things going on.

00:32:20.310 --> 00:32:23.880 align:middle line:84%
In 1978, when officially
they claimed to be leaving,

00:32:23.880 --> 00:32:27.060 align:middle line:84%
the Adriatic Sea went and
did absolutely turmoil.

00:32:27.060 --> 00:32:29.360 align:middle line:84%
Several fisherman were
killed, I believe, and--

00:32:29.360 --> 00:32:30.390 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Was this
part of the fight?

00:32:30.390 --> 00:32:31.556 align:middle line:90%
>>GOOD: -accordind to-- yes.

00:32:31.556 --> 00:32:35.220 align:middle line:84%
There was an undersea battle
being waged apparently

00:32:35.220 --> 00:32:38.680 align:middle line:84%
between these
Contrari, if you like.

00:32:38.680 --> 00:32:41.267 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And are most of
them in the sea, these beings

00:32:41.267 --> 00:32:42.350 align:middle line:90%
that you're talking about?

00:32:42.350 --> 00:32:43.440 align:middle line:90%
>>GOOD: The base is.

00:32:43.440 --> 00:32:44.090 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: These
bases in the sea?

00:32:44.090 --> 00:32:44.590 align:middle line:90%
>>GOOD: No.

00:32:44.590 --> 00:32:49.770 align:middle line:84%
They had, for example, a base
in the north of the Abruzzo

00:32:49.770 --> 00:32:52.560 align:middle line:84%
region, which was
about 184 miles long.

00:32:52.560 --> 00:32:57.120 align:middle line:84%
These bases, you think, gosh,
they've got guys with things.

00:32:57.120 --> 00:32:58.930 align:middle line:90%
They can be created in seconds.

00:32:58.930 --> 00:33:02.010 align:middle line:84%
They have the technology
to compact matter.

00:33:02.010 --> 00:33:04.980 align:middle line:84%
And when they compact
matter, it makes

00:33:04.980 --> 00:33:08.404 align:middle line:90%
the surround much more solid.

00:33:08.404 --> 00:33:09.320 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Interesting.

00:33:09.320 --> 00:33:10.140 align:middle line:90%
>>GOOD: Think of it.

00:33:10.140 --> 00:33:10.520 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Interesting.

00:33:10.520 --> 00:33:12.434 align:middle line:84%
>>GOOD: And then when
they leave, they just

00:33:12.434 --> 00:33:13.350 align:middle line:90%
close it all in again.

00:33:13.350 --> 00:33:15.360 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And what
is their agenda?

00:33:15.360 --> 00:33:18.154 align:middle line:90%
According to the Amicizia Group.

00:33:18.154 --> 00:33:19.820 align:middle line:10%
>>GOOD: According to
the Amicizia Group,

00:33:19.820 --> 00:33:24.200 align:middle line:10%
to help us to
progress, and to help

00:33:24.200 --> 00:33:28.526 align:middle line:10%
them deal with the situation
from other aliens, who do not

00:33:28.526 --> 00:33:29.900 align:middle line:10%
have our best
interests at heart.

00:33:29.900 --> 00:33:31.500 align:middle line:10%
That is where the problem lies.

00:33:31.500 --> 00:33:33.000 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And we'll
leave it at that

00:33:33.000 --> 00:33:35.002 align:middle line:84%
because we've had
many conversations

00:33:35.002 --> 00:33:36.710 align:middle line:84%
with different people
talking about this.

00:33:36.710 --> 00:33:38.875 align:middle line:84%
And I appreciate your
perspectives on it.

00:33:38.875 --> 00:33:40.250 align:middle line:84%
And thank you so
much for sharing

00:33:40.250 --> 00:33:41.920 align:middle line:84%
your personal
encounters as well.

00:33:41.920 --> 00:33:42.670 align:middle line:90%
>>GOOD: Thank you.

00:33:42.670 --> 00:33:44.137 align:middle line:90%
My pleasure.

00:33:44.137 --> 00:34:03.634 align:middle line:90%
