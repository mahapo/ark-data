[ Music and Nature Sounds ]

00:00:20.020 --> 00:00:21.254 align:middle line:90%
One of the great mysteries

00:00:21.254 --> 00:00:24.491 align:middle line:84%
of history has been the
lost continent of Atlantis.

00:00:24.491 --> 00:00:27.127 align:middle line:84%
The orthodox scientific
community relegates it

00:00:27.127 --> 00:00:29.362 align:middle line:90%
to legend, but if you move back

00:00:29.362 --> 00:00:32.165 align:middle line:84%
into ancient history it
was often referred to even

00:00:32.165 --> 00:00:34.968 align:middle line:84%
by such philosophical
luminaries as Plato.

00:00:34.968 --> 00:00:36.970 align:middle line:84%
According to the
Edgar Cayce readings,

00:00:36.970 --> 00:00:39.606 align:middle line:84%
"It matters that we are aware
of its existence, because we're

00:00:39.606 --> 00:00:42.475 align:middle line:84%
about to enter a similar
potential of destruction

00:00:42.475 --> 00:00:45.011 align:middle line:84%
or salvation, depending
on how we choose

00:00:45.011 --> 00:00:46.580 align:middle line:90%
to use our technologies."

00:00:46.580 --> 00:00:50.116 align:middle line:84%
Raymond Tarpey is a Cayce
scholar who also shares that,

00:00:50.116 --> 00:00:52.953 align:middle line:84%
"The people who lived in the
Atlantean times are back,

00:00:52.953 --> 00:00:55.088 align:middle line:90%
particularly in America."

00:00:55.088 --> 00:00:58.391 align:middle line:84%
Welcome back, conversation
number two, we just had a blast

00:00:58.391 --> 00:01:01.194 align:middle line:84%
in conversation number one
talking about the origins

00:01:01.194 --> 00:01:04.164 align:middle line:84%
of the species and many other
things that you peppered

00:01:04.164 --> 00:01:07.834 align:middle line:84%
in there, and so let's do a
quick little recap on that

00:01:07.834 --> 00:01:10.270 align:middle line:84%
and how we get to
Atlantis from there.

00:01:10.270 --> 00:01:15.175 align:middle line:84%
Okay, the recap would be we
went to the story of creation,

00:01:15.175 --> 00:01:18.044 align:middle line:90%
of this particular creation not

00:01:18.044 --> 00:01:21.481 align:middle line:84%
that there haven't been ones
before and will come after,

00:01:21.481 --> 00:01:24.284 align:middle line:84%
this whole universe is part
of the creation and one

00:01:24.284 --> 00:01:30.156 align:middle line:84%
of the universes, and we found
how we were originally spirit

00:01:30.156 --> 00:01:33.260 align:middle line:84%
beings, and that we
have a spirit destiny,

00:01:33.260 --> 00:01:37.964 align:middle line:84%
but when get entwined with
matter, then we lose that memory

00:01:37.964 --> 00:01:42.202 align:middle line:84%
and we prefer to deny it
because we're enjoying our self

00:01:42.202 --> 00:01:43.904 align:middle line:90%
in this place.

00:01:43.904 --> 00:01:47.641 align:middle line:84%
But this enjoyment had
pitfalls designed for us

00:01:47.641 --> 00:01:50.042 align:middle line:90%
to awaken and see the reality.

00:01:50.042 --> 00:01:53.380 align:middle line:84%
Reality is the main word you
see in the Buddhist temple,

00:01:53.380 --> 00:01:55.081 align:middle line:90%
every Buddhist temple, there's

00:01:55.081 --> 00:01:58.584 align:middle line:84%
on Chinese word,
"xianshi", "reality."

00:01:58.584 --> 00:02:03.556 align:middle line:84%
It's like, "Xianshi, wake up
and see what is really here

00:02:03.556 --> 00:02:07.827 align:middle line:84%
and fulfill your contract in
between enjoyments [laughter].

00:02:07.827 --> 00:02:09.362 align:middle line:84%
[Laughter] well, yes,
in between enjoyments.

00:02:09.362 --> 00:02:13.633 align:middle line:84%
It is critical that we enjoy
this life, we've chosen it,

00:02:13.633 --> 00:02:17.103 align:middle line:84%
but you talk about how we came
for the pleasure of immersing

00:02:17.103 --> 00:02:18.905 align:middle line:90%
with matter and exploration.

00:02:18.905 --> 00:02:20.240 align:middle line:84%
We also talked about
how the fact

00:02:20.240 --> 00:02:22.342 align:middle line:84%
that many souls became
trapped in that,

00:02:22.342 --> 00:02:24.811 align:middle line:84%
and then did lose their
memory of the other.

00:02:24.811 --> 00:02:27.113 align:middle line:84%
That has created also
a tremendous amount

00:02:27.113 --> 00:02:28.348 align:middle line:90%
of trauma and pain.

00:02:28.348 --> 00:02:33.486 align:middle line:84%
To be a species that is
unaware of its more eternal

00:02:33.486 --> 00:02:38.525 align:middle line:84%
and wise half, creates and
internal disconnect and trauma.

00:02:38.525 --> 00:02:41.428 align:middle line:84%
And it creates a
controllable population.

00:02:41.428 --> 00:02:42.529 align:middle line:90%
A controllable population, yes.

00:02:42.529 --> 00:02:45.699 align:middle line:84%
Because the material
will begin to control,

00:02:45.699 --> 00:02:49.035 align:middle line:90%
you have no other recourse.

00:02:49.035 --> 00:02:53.473 align:middle line:84%
You think you have a certain
hierarchy and a certain place,

00:02:53.473 --> 00:02:58.144 align:middle line:84%
that's only in that world,
that material world, you are --

00:02:58.144 --> 00:03:03.450 align:middle line:84%
you are nobility, and what
the spirit life teaches is

00:03:03.450 --> 00:03:08.421 align:middle line:84%
that you are noble, you are
the one, you are the teacher,

00:03:08.421 --> 00:03:13.093 align:middle line:84%
you are the shaman and your
job in this life is to achieve

00:03:13.093 --> 00:03:17.230 align:middle line:84%
that level of resonance so that
we can all achieve together

00:03:17.230 --> 00:03:18.331 align:middle line:90%
and be free.

00:03:18.331 --> 00:03:21.401 align:middle line:84%
And as you also talked
about, when we were

00:03:21.401 --> 00:03:24.838 align:middle line:84%
in the nonmaterial realms
before being encased

00:03:24.838 --> 00:03:28.541 align:middle line:84%
and ultimately trapped into the
physical world, we were able

00:03:28.541 --> 00:03:30.410 align:middle line:84%
to create at the
speed of thought,

00:03:30.410 --> 00:03:31.811 align:middle line:90%
we were master creators,

00:03:31.811 --> 00:03:34.280 align:middle line:84%
this world was created
via thought forms

00:03:34.280 --> 00:03:39.019 align:middle line:84%
from even a larger source of
creation, and so we've been --

00:03:39.019 --> 00:03:42.389 align:middle line:84%
we're slow as mud now trying
to make anything happen

00:03:42.389 --> 00:03:43.623 align:middle line:84%
in the physical world
[laughter].

00:03:43.623 --> 00:03:46.225 align:middle line:84%
We're a shadow, we have
the shadow creative ability

00:03:46.225 --> 00:03:49.596 align:middle line:84%
of what we once had and
we're trying to duplicate it

00:03:49.596 --> 00:03:52.932 align:middle line:84%
in the material, but the
spiritual is helping us to do it

00:03:52.932 --> 00:03:56.535 align:middle line:84%
and working our way backwards
through a plan because we're

00:03:56.535 --> 00:03:59.039 align:middle line:84%
under a plan right
now, it's called --

00:03:59.039 --> 00:04:00.807 align:middle line:84%
I call it the plan
of revelation.

00:04:00.807 --> 00:04:04.944 align:middle line:84%
It is established by Amelius,
the one who split himself

00:04:04.944 --> 00:04:08.648 align:middle line:84%
into five different Adam
and Eves simultaneously,

00:04:08.648 --> 00:04:15.588 align:middle line:84%
at some point over 200,000
years ago, at that --

00:04:15.588 --> 00:04:18.624 align:middle line:84%
I don't know the form that
that took, it could have been

00:04:18.624 --> 00:04:24.197 align:middle line:84%
on the spiritual realm,
infusing into individuals

00:04:24.197 --> 00:04:26.800 align:middle line:90%
in the five areas of the earth.

00:04:26.800 --> 00:04:30.437 align:middle line:84%
We have to go into each one of
them to explain how that evolved

00:04:30.437 --> 00:04:36.643 align:middle line:84%
and unfolded, but the plan is
afoot and we are to remember

00:04:36.643 --> 00:04:39.546 align:middle line:84%
that we have help at
all points in time,

00:04:39.546 --> 00:04:43.216 align:middle line:84%
all we have to do
is sit and meditate

00:04:43.216 --> 00:04:48.354 align:middle line:84%
and realize our preciousness,
you are precious, you are loved

00:04:48.354 --> 00:04:53.293 align:middle line:84%
to a degree that you can't
even imagine, it's all created

00:04:53.293 --> 00:04:59.265 align:middle line:84%
for you, and all we have to
do is realize our preciousness

00:04:59.265 --> 00:05:03.670 align:middle line:84%
and melt that fear away and
the people controlling are

00:05:03.670 --> 00:05:08.975 align:middle line:84%
like a house of cards,
so also will they fall.

00:05:08.975 --> 00:05:11.377 align:middle line:84%
And so the pain that
we're experiencing

00:05:11.377 --> 00:05:14.414 align:middle line:84%
as a species is only
a matter of the degree

00:05:14.414 --> 00:05:16.382 align:middle line:84%
to which we're cut
off from ourselves.

00:05:16.382 --> 00:05:18.284 align:middle line:84%
That's correct, our
spirit selves.

00:05:18.284 --> 00:05:22.088 align:middle line:84%
Yes, and let's talk about the
ones that are controlling,

00:05:22.088 --> 00:05:23.823 align:middle line:84%
you brought this
up in the past...

00:05:23.823 --> 00:05:25.492 align:middle line:84%
Yes. ...in the last
conversation,

00:05:25.492 --> 00:05:27.961 align:middle line:84%
we need to discuss it again
because it lays the foundation

00:05:27.961 --> 00:05:31.064 align:middle line:84%
for what played out in the
various iterations of Atlantis.

00:05:31.064 --> 00:05:33.466 align:middle line:84%
Correct. So we're talking
about, according to Edgar Cayce,

00:05:33.466 --> 00:05:36.870 align:middle line:84%
and this same story shows
up as light and dark

00:05:36.870 --> 00:05:39.405 align:middle line:84%
and travel throughout
all of the...

00:05:39.405 --> 00:05:45.678 align:middle line:84%
Oh yes and Citreous and Timeous
and Plato, Socrates was involved

00:05:45.678 --> 00:05:48.948 align:middle line:84%
in the dialogue, they're all
talking about the same thing;

00:05:48.948 --> 00:05:53.586 align:middle line:90%
how the ruling elite lost it,

00:05:53.586 --> 00:05:56.022 align:middle line:84%
and they considered
themselves noble

00:05:56.022 --> 00:05:59.893 align:middle line:84%
and all the others peasantry
and created what they call

00:05:59.893 --> 00:06:03.329 align:middle line:84%
"The Great Lie" of the
hierarchy of beings.

00:06:03.329 --> 00:06:06.866 align:middle line:84%
There is no hierarchy of
beings; they are all equal.

00:06:06.866 --> 00:06:11.271 align:middle line:84%
Yes, and one of -- and another
legend that I became aware

00:06:11.271 --> 00:06:16.176 align:middle line:84%
of about 30 years ago, very,
very similar to Edgar Cayce's,

00:06:16.176 --> 00:06:20.914 align:middle line:84%
when the trapping came about,
the trapping of the souls

00:06:20.914 --> 00:06:24.083 align:middle line:84%
into the physical, no
longer able to escape back

00:06:24.083 --> 00:06:28.254 align:middle line:84%
in to freely go between
their true essence,

00:06:28.254 --> 00:06:30.790 align:middle line:84%
nonphysical essence
and what they are now,

00:06:30.790 --> 00:06:33.793 align:middle line:84%
when that happened there
were those who did retain --

00:06:33.793 --> 00:06:36.563 align:middle line:84%
were able to traverse and retain
a good amount of knowledge,

00:06:36.563 --> 00:06:41.334 align:middle line:84%
who by virtue of that became
those who were the leaders.

00:06:41.334 --> 00:06:45.138 align:middle line:84%
But within that you had
two camps; we talked about,

00:06:45.138 --> 00:06:47.807 align:middle line:84%
the Sons of the Law of
One and the Sons of Belial

00:06:47.807 --> 00:06:52.545 align:middle line:84%
as Edgar Cayce describes these
two philosophical factions

00:06:52.545 --> 00:06:54.881 align:middle line:84%
of those who remained
in power in the very,

00:06:54.881 --> 00:06:56.683 align:middle line:90%
very early days of humanity.

00:06:56.683 --> 00:06:58.718 align:middle line:84%
Can you talk about
the objectives of each

00:06:58.718 --> 00:07:00.587 align:middle line:90%
or the philosophy of each?

00:07:00.587 --> 00:07:04.257 align:middle line:84%
Well, the Sons of Belial were
involved with the technology.

00:07:04.257 --> 00:07:08.428 align:middle line:84%
They realized that they
had power and they came

00:07:08.428 --> 00:07:14.300 align:middle line:84%
to ignore their spirit selves
and we still have many beings

00:07:14.300 --> 00:07:17.103 align:middle line:84%
on the earth that ignore
their spirit selves,

00:07:17.103 --> 00:07:20.639 align:middle line:84%
they think that they
can prove everything.

00:07:20.639 --> 00:07:22.609 align:middle line:90%
Proving is ego.

00:07:22.609 --> 00:07:24.877 align:middle line:90%
It is a controlling act.

00:07:24.877 --> 00:07:28.181 align:middle line:84%
There is no proof, there
is only the looking,

00:07:28.181 --> 00:07:31.117 align:middle line:84%
there is only the
realizing of the self

00:07:31.117 --> 00:07:34.520 align:middle line:84%
that it's been here
long before us,

00:07:34.520 --> 00:07:37.724 align:middle line:90%
it will be here long after us.

00:07:37.724 --> 00:07:39.659 align:middle line:90%
We did not create it.

00:07:39.659 --> 00:07:44.030 align:middle line:84%
Some -- we were born into an
incredibly intelligent place

00:07:44.030 --> 00:07:49.435 align:middle line:84%
and science helps us by showing
us how incredibly intelligence

00:07:49.435 --> 00:07:51.137 align:middle line:90%
nature is.

00:07:51.137 --> 00:07:52.538 align:middle line:90%
Now we have to begin

00:07:52.538 --> 00:07:56.509 align:middle line:84%
to ask ourselves individually,
"Who is the shaman?"

00:07:56.509 --> 00:08:00.947 align:middle line:84%
And the first question
that the shaman asks is,

00:08:00.947 --> 00:08:03.283 align:middle line:90%
"Who's running the show?"

00:08:03.283 --> 00:08:06.286 align:middle line:84%
When you're sleeping with
your name, like "I am Raymond,

00:08:06.286 --> 00:08:10.823 align:middle line:84%
I'm sleeping," who's
conducting my digestion,

00:08:10.823 --> 00:08:14.961 align:middle line:84%
this complex thing, the heart,
the circulation of the blood?

00:08:14.961 --> 00:08:16.629 align:middle line:90%
Who's healing all the cells

00:08:16.629 --> 00:08:20.199 align:middle line:84%
in my body while
Raymond is sleeping?"

00:08:20.199 --> 00:08:23.403 align:middle line:84%
Now, you can ask that question
of people and some people say,

00:08:23.403 --> 00:08:26.472 align:middle line:84%
"Well, that's my brain,"
and that's how humans

00:08:26.472 --> 00:08:29.676 align:middle line:84%
like to take credit for
things that they're not doing.

00:08:29.676 --> 00:08:32.577 align:middle line:84%
It's not yours because
you're not doing it,

00:08:32.577 --> 00:08:36.481 align:middle line:84%
you're claiming something that
you're not doing, so the waking

00:08:36.481 --> 00:08:39.986 align:middle line:84%
up means stop claiming
intelligence

00:08:39.986 --> 00:08:43.323 align:middle line:84%
that you're not doing, and
saying, "You're just doing it

00:08:43.323 --> 00:08:46.626 align:middle line:84%
on a subconscious level,"
then start to listen

00:08:46.626 --> 00:08:48.761 align:middle line:84%
to that subconscious
level because that's

00:08:48.761 --> 00:08:50.997 align:middle line:90%
where the intelligence is.

00:08:50.997 --> 00:08:52.198 align:middle line:90%
Absolutely.

00:08:52.198 --> 00:08:54.901 align:middle line:84%
Okay, so now we've set
the foundation of players.

00:08:54.901 --> 00:08:59.072 align:middle line:84%
Yes. Now let's go -- there
was a migration and we talked

00:08:59.072 --> 00:09:01.341 align:middle line:84%
about the Mayans,
the Mayans are unique

00:09:01.341 --> 00:09:03.109 align:middle line:84%
in that they had the
migration of those

00:09:03.109 --> 00:09:04.711 align:middle line:90%
from Lemuria on one side...

00:09:04.711 --> 00:09:07.647 align:middle line:84%
Yes. ...and the pacific,
and then from the Atlantic,

00:09:07.647 --> 00:09:10.316 align:middle line:84%
The Atlanteans, and so the
Mayan legend came about,

00:09:10.316 --> 00:09:13.753 align:middle line:84%
and you're a scholar in this
area, you even do Mayan readings

00:09:13.753 --> 00:09:16.556 align:middle line:84%
for people which is at a
depth far beyond astrology,

00:09:16.556 --> 00:09:17.924 align:middle line:90%
goes into the depth of the soul.

00:09:17.924 --> 00:09:19.625 align:middle line:90%
It's American astrology.

00:09:19.625 --> 00:09:20.927 align:middle line:90%
American astrology.

00:09:20.927 --> 00:09:24.230 align:middle line:84%
American-Indian astrology,
which came through the heart

00:09:24.230 --> 00:09:27.467 align:middle line:84%
of the Americas, it's no
mistake that the Maya are right

00:09:27.467 --> 00:09:29.602 align:middle line:84%
in the heart, the
center of the two pieces

00:09:29.602 --> 00:09:32.805 align:middle line:84%
like a giant butterfly,
they are the center

00:09:32.805 --> 00:09:38.578 align:middle line:84%
and their culture is picked to
survive, and their writing came

00:09:38.578 --> 00:09:42.015 align:middle line:84%
to us direct so that the
westerner can appreciate it.

00:09:42.015 --> 00:09:45.218 align:middle line:84%
If there's no writing the
westerner has a hard time

00:09:45.218 --> 00:09:46.886 align:middle line:90%
appreciating or...

00:09:46.886 --> 00:09:47.553 align:middle line:90%
Accepting...

00:09:47.553 --> 00:09:48.955 align:middle line:90%
valuing a culture.

00:09:48.955 --> 00:09:53.192 align:middle line:84%
They have to have that
writing, and so it is the gift,

00:09:53.192 --> 00:09:56.863 align:middle line:84%
it is the gift of the Christ
that came through the Maya

00:09:56.863 --> 00:10:00.800 align:middle line:84%
that that writing was preserved
to us as an ancient record;

00:10:00.800 --> 00:10:03.136 align:middle line:84%
it's hard to stop it
because we're helped.

00:10:03.136 --> 00:10:04.837 align:middle line:84%
And that's why the
Maya are so prominent

00:10:04.837 --> 00:10:06.172 align:middle line:90%
at this point in history.

00:10:06.172 --> 00:10:10.042 align:middle line:84%
Correct. So, now we know their
lineage, but let's go now

00:10:10.042 --> 00:10:14.280 align:middle line:84%
from Lemuria which
overlapped with the seeding

00:10:14.280 --> 00:10:18.518 align:middle line:84%
of the populations in the
upper Atlantean stage,

00:10:18.518 --> 00:10:20.686 align:middle line:84%
the higher stage,
the early stage.

00:10:20.686 --> 00:10:26.225 align:middle line:84%
The first migrations are
coming in from Lemuria

00:10:26.225 --> 00:10:31.431 align:middle line:84%
and they're coming in earlier
so far -- I stick with science,

00:10:31.431 --> 00:10:35.535 align:middle line:84%
too, I want the scientists out
there to remember I love you

00:10:35.535 --> 00:10:40.840 align:middle line:84%
for doing all the grunt work
so we can use this, too,

00:10:40.840 --> 00:10:44.143 align:middle line:84%
as evidence for things,
and it guides us.

00:10:44.143 --> 00:10:46.245 align:middle line:84%
The scientists are
doing the valuable work,

00:10:46.245 --> 00:10:49.449 align:middle line:84%
the archaeologists; I
respect every one of them.

00:10:49.449 --> 00:10:52.218 align:middle line:84%
They're crawling
through with paintbrushes

00:10:52.218 --> 00:10:55.354 align:middle line:84%
and little toothbrushes
and doing this all for us,

00:10:55.354 --> 00:10:57.256 align:middle line:90%
it is a great sacrifice.

00:10:57.256 --> 00:11:00.693 align:middle line:84%
And what they found is the
Mu/Lemurian culture was most

00:11:00.693 --> 00:11:04.964 align:middle line:84%
prominent in Peru first, because
the oldest ones are found

00:11:04.964 --> 00:11:06.065 align:middle line:90%
on the Pacific coasts,

00:11:06.065 --> 00:11:09.068 align:middle line:84%
that's why the Andes
civilizations developed

00:11:09.068 --> 00:11:13.873 align:middle line:84%
at that specific area, and so
the greatest discovery now is

00:11:13.873 --> 00:11:19.178 align:middle line:84%
in Peru, the great pyramids
of the Caral Supe culture.

00:11:19.178 --> 00:11:20.246 align:middle line:90%
Yes, mm-hmm.

00:11:20.246 --> 00:11:24.784 align:middle line:84%
Which Ruth, Dr. Ruth
Shawdee came across,

00:11:24.784 --> 00:11:27.453 align:middle line:84%
there's a big archeological
controversy

00:11:27.453 --> 00:11:30.957 align:middle line:84%
about a credit thing that's
going on, but it's okay,

00:11:30.957 --> 00:11:32.725 align:middle line:90%
I just -- I visited down there

00:11:32.725 --> 00:11:38.364 align:middle line:84%
because after I got my crystal
skull I was led from the Maya

00:11:38.364 --> 00:11:41.968 align:middle line:84%
to Peru and my daughter
married a guy from Peru and all

00:11:41.968 --> 00:11:45.671 align:middle line:84%
of a sudden I'm drawn there
by this crystal skull energy,

00:11:45.671 --> 00:11:50.443 align:middle line:84%
and I visited Caral Supe
and I saw one of about 19

00:11:50.443 --> 00:11:56.015 align:middle line:84%
or 20 pyramid sites, huge, and
they're built at the same time

00:11:56.015 --> 00:12:01.354 align:middle line:84%
or before Giza, and around
them we find no forts,

00:12:01.354 --> 00:12:02.989 align:middle line:90%
no fortifications.

00:12:02.989 --> 00:12:05.691 align:middle line:84%
Most -- and weaponry,
none of it.

00:12:05.691 --> 00:12:06.959 align:middle line:90%
Musical instruments.

00:12:06.959 --> 00:12:08.261 align:middle line:90%
Interesting.

00:12:08.261 --> 00:12:12.098 align:middle line:84%
Now, if we're putting a date
on that, supposedly the --

00:12:12.098 --> 00:12:14.467 align:middle line:84%
according to the Edgar
Cayce readings, the Pyramids

00:12:14.467 --> 00:12:18.404 align:middle line:84%
at Giza were looking at
12,500 years ago roughly.

00:12:18.404 --> 00:12:19.171 align:middle line:90%
That's correct.

00:12:19.171 --> 00:12:20.473 align:middle line:90%
Which is also...

00:12:20.473 --> 00:12:22.408 align:middle line:84%
Based on the great pyramid,
because it's the anomaly,

00:12:22.408 --> 00:12:27.013 align:middle line:84%
and the greatest anomaly is what
pharaoh would you know would not

00:12:27.013 --> 00:12:29.582 align:middle line:90%
put his name on inside?

00:12:29.582 --> 00:12:32.518 align:middle line:84%
No carvings at all
in that pyramid.

00:12:32.518 --> 00:12:35.788 align:middle line:84%
And of course the first
pyramid, the Great Pyramid,

00:12:35.788 --> 00:12:38.491 align:middle line:84%
is the greatest one,
then everybody declined

00:12:38.491 --> 00:12:40.259 align:middle line:90%
and forgot everything.

00:12:40.259 --> 00:12:44.263 align:middle line:84%
So what -- what many
people who study history

00:12:44.263 --> 00:12:49.235 align:middle line:84%
in this other vein think
is that they found that.

00:12:49.235 --> 00:12:52.538 align:middle line:84%
The cultures that came out of
the Sahara when the Sahara dried

00:12:52.538 --> 00:12:57.209 align:middle line:84%
up and flowed into Egypt,
they found this pyramid there,

00:12:57.209 --> 00:13:00.079 align:middle line:84%
and their next pyramids
were attempts

00:13:00.079 --> 00:13:02.214 align:middle line:90%
to imitate what they found.

00:13:02.214 --> 00:13:04.216 align:middle line:84%
Yes, much of like what's
happen in South America

00:13:04.216 --> 00:13:06.852 align:middle line:84%
and Central America as well
in later civilizations,

00:13:06.852 --> 00:13:11.624 align:middle line:84%
so going back, the Lemurians,
the first point of immigration

00:13:11.624 --> 00:13:14.660 align:middle line:90%
so to speak was to Peru.

00:13:14.660 --> 00:13:17.563 align:middle line:84%
Now, let's look at how the
Atlantean leap occurred.

00:13:17.563 --> 00:13:22.234 align:middle line:84%
The Atlanteans came --
were coming through also,

00:13:22.234 --> 00:13:24.503 align:middle line:84%
but it seems like
they're earliest in Peru,

00:13:24.503 --> 00:13:28.140 align:middle line:84%
they came through way
earlier than 3,000, 4,000,

00:13:28.140 --> 00:13:31.777 align:middle line:84%
10,000 because in order to build
those pyramids you had to go

00:13:31.777 --> 00:13:35.847 align:middle line:84%
through and it's not always when
you migrate that the people,

00:13:35.847 --> 00:13:38.250 align:middle line:84%
the master craftsmen
get to migrate.

00:13:38.250 --> 00:13:40.853 align:middle line:84%
They may have died so you
had to start from scratch,

00:13:40.853 --> 00:13:44.023 align:middle line:84%
but at least you had the
memory of what could be

00:13:44.023 --> 00:13:46.525 align:middle line:84%
and that's the most
important thing to have.

00:13:46.525 --> 00:13:48.294 align:middle line:84%
And in a way we're
out of sequence

00:13:48.294 --> 00:13:51.631 align:middle line:84%
because as we're talking
about Egypt 12,500 years ago

00:13:51.631 --> 00:13:55.534 align:middle line:84%
as the Great Pyramid, that
is a remnant of Atlantis.

00:13:55.534 --> 00:13:58.004 align:middle line:84%
So now I'm going to take
us back to Atlantis,

00:13:58.004 --> 00:14:01.207 align:middle line:84%
that upper civilization,
what the beings were like,

00:14:01.207 --> 00:14:05.011 align:middle line:84%
the dramas that were playing out
on that stage, the technologies,

00:14:05.011 --> 00:14:08.014 align:middle line:84%
mental and physical that
were available to us.

00:14:08.014 --> 00:14:11.817 align:middle line:84%
What was life like when the
entire continent was whole

00:14:11.817 --> 00:14:13.185 align:middle line:90%
in the Upper Atlanteans Phase?

00:14:13.185 --> 00:14:15.821 align:middle line:84%
When it was whole
it was beautiful,

00:14:15.821 --> 00:14:23.062 align:middle line:84%
because they recognized crystal
as the way to communicate

00:14:23.062 --> 00:14:24.830 align:middle line:90%
with other dimensions.

00:14:24.830 --> 00:14:27.933 align:middle line:84%
Edgar Cayce mentioned
the Pleiades are tourists

00:14:27.933 --> 00:14:31.504 align:middle line:84%
from the light shining
upon us is filled

00:14:31.504 --> 00:14:34.407 align:middle line:84%
with intelligence
if we're open to it.

00:14:34.407 --> 00:14:38.544 align:middle line:84%
One of the first meditations of
the American Indians is to look

00:14:38.544 --> 00:14:43.716 align:middle line:84%
at the moon, stare at the moon's
light and find the rabbit.

00:14:43.716 --> 00:14:47.119 align:middle line:84%
Find the rabbit there and
you've taken the first step

00:14:47.119 --> 00:14:50.056 align:middle line:84%
into feeling what
the moon really is

00:14:50.056 --> 00:14:53.459 align:middle line:84%
and what intelligence it
can give through light

00:14:53.459 --> 00:14:55.928 align:middle line:90%
into your inner being.

00:14:55.928 --> 00:14:59.865 align:middle line:84%
So going back to the
Atlanteans and the understanding

00:14:59.865 --> 00:15:02.068 align:middle line:84%
that crystal was the
communication device

00:15:02.068 --> 00:15:05.271 align:middle line:84%
between dimensions because these
were kind of fresh off the boat.

00:15:05.271 --> 00:15:08.040 align:middle line:84%
A lot of these beings were
newly seeded to the planet,

00:15:08.040 --> 00:15:11.444 align:middle line:84%
taking the material form
there, as happened in Mu

00:15:11.444 --> 00:15:13.045 align:middle line:90%
and Lemuria prior to that.

00:15:13.045 --> 00:15:17.383 align:middle line:84%
And they had their early
ages of great achievement

00:15:17.383 --> 00:15:21.487 align:middle line:84%
where they got it together and
they had a Democratic society.

00:15:21.487 --> 00:15:26.726 align:middle line:84%
Edgar Cayce said that and so
did Plato, but gradually even

00:15:26.726 --> 00:15:30.896 align:middle line:84%
in Plato, it agrees with Edgar
Cayce that the God part of them,

00:15:30.896 --> 00:15:39.872 align:middle line:84%
the spirit part of them became
more and more smaller, more...

00:15:39.872 --> 00:15:41.140 align:middle line:90%
Recessive.

00:15:41.140 --> 00:15:44.510 align:middle line:84%
...less seen, less effective,
less seen, forgotten,

00:15:44.510 --> 00:15:49.081 align:middle line:84%
and so the more they were
led into that material realm

00:15:49.081 --> 00:15:52.118 align:middle line:90%
and then they went away from --

00:15:52.118 --> 00:15:55.654 align:middle line:84%
they wanted to increase their
pleasure, their attachments,

00:15:55.654 --> 00:15:57.923 align:middle line:84%
and part of their
pleasure is control

00:15:57.923 --> 00:16:00.292 align:middle line:90%
of others, the ego loves it.

00:16:00.292 --> 00:16:04.096 align:middle line:84%
"I am the one, me, and I
just enjoy being important

00:16:04.096 --> 00:16:06.065 align:middle line:90%
and other people bowing to me.

00:16:06.065 --> 00:16:07.933 align:middle line:90%
I am the creator."

00:16:07.933 --> 00:16:11.670 align:middle line:84%
Then we -- the greatest
definition I've heard of ego is

00:16:11.670 --> 00:16:16.375 align:middle line:84%
"Edge God Out," [laughter]
I am the god!

00:16:16.375 --> 00:16:19.845 align:middle line:84%
Right? The divine right
of kings comes through.

00:16:19.845 --> 00:16:22.748 align:middle line:84%
Well, what's interesting
about that to me is that,

00:16:22.748 --> 00:16:24.550 align:middle line:84%
as you're speaking
about it, you have --

00:16:24.550 --> 00:16:26.018 align:middle line:84%
beings who are fresh
off the boat

00:16:26.018 --> 00:16:30.589 align:middle line:84%
from another dimensional area,
taking the physical and the ones

00:16:30.589 --> 00:16:34.927 align:middle line:84%
who weren't damaged, and
weren't lost in this encasement,

00:16:34.927 --> 00:16:39.097 align:middle line:84%
and did keep both aspects of
the being connected and alive,

00:16:39.097 --> 00:16:42.735 align:middle line:84%
lots of technological and other
information flowed through them.

00:16:42.735 --> 00:16:44.804 align:middle line:90%
They had very high capabilities.

00:16:44.804 --> 00:16:47.273 align:middle line:84%
Can you talk about
some of what Cayce --

00:16:47.273 --> 00:16:50.843 align:middle line:84%
Cayce's readings revealed in
terms of what we were doing,

00:16:50.843 --> 00:16:52.812 align:middle line:84%
what the place looked
like, the technologies,

00:16:52.812 --> 00:16:54.780 align:middle line:84%
the agricultural
practices and so forth?

00:16:54.780 --> 00:16:57.983 align:middle line:84%
The technology involved
the cutting of canals,

00:16:57.983 --> 00:17:03.422 align:middle line:84%
there were canals and they
were towers and temples to --

00:17:03.422 --> 00:17:09.929 align:middle line:84%
according to the Greek myth it
was the giving out to Poseidon.

00:17:09.929 --> 00:17:14.567 align:middle line:84%
He was granted at that field
according to the Greek myth,

00:17:14.567 --> 00:17:17.937 align:middle line:84%
much like the Amelius,
and so Edgar Cayce said

00:17:17.937 --> 00:17:23.209 align:middle line:84%
that those islands, there were
three main ones, Poseidia,

00:17:23.209 --> 00:17:30.216 align:middle line:84%
Oak and Aryan, so the
"Aryan" word that we use,

00:17:30.216 --> 00:17:34.720 align:middle line:84%
I know the word "oak" because
I studied Gaelic, and the word

00:17:34.720 --> 00:17:38.858 align:middle line:84%
in Gaelic in for "oak"
is "youth" or "young",

00:17:38.858 --> 00:17:42.761 align:middle line:84%
the land of the young,
the land of forever young

00:17:42.761 --> 00:17:45.631 align:middle line:84%
because they could live to
long age during those time.

00:17:45.631 --> 00:17:46.699 align:middle line:90%
Let's talk about that.

00:17:46.699 --> 00:17:48.834 align:middle line:84%
What kind of life
spans did we have then?

00:17:48.834 --> 00:17:51.670 align:middle line:84%
Well you look at the
Bible as the best --

00:17:51.670 --> 00:17:53.672 align:middle line:90%
we don't have exact sources,

00:17:53.672 --> 00:17:57.009 align:middle line:84%
Edgar Cayce said they lived
long ages at certain periods

00:17:57.009 --> 00:18:01.313 align:middle line:84%
and then we had the bible to
go to and other sources also

00:18:01.313 --> 00:18:03.482 align:middle line:84%
that say the same
thing around the world.

00:18:03.482 --> 00:18:05.351 align:middle line:84%
So we're looking at
700, 800, 900 years.

00:18:05.351 --> 00:18:07.987 align:middle line:84%
Right, because even today
scientists have no idea why

00:18:07.987 --> 00:18:09.121 align:middle line:90%
we age.

00:18:09.121 --> 00:18:11.490 align:middle line:84%
Right, it's like some
switch got turned off.

00:18:11.490 --> 00:18:12.958 align:middle line:90%
There's no reason for it

00:18:12.958 --> 00:18:18.397 align:middle line:84%
and I think we've cut off our
home juices and perhaps we want

00:18:18.397 --> 00:18:21.000 align:middle line:84%
to get out of here after
a while, it's suffering

00:18:21.000 --> 00:18:24.837 align:middle line:84%
because we're trapped and we
know we're going no further.

00:18:24.837 --> 00:18:26.372 align:middle line:90%
Okay, now that makes sense.

00:18:26.372 --> 00:18:28.440 align:middle line:84%
So the other thing
they were doing

00:18:28.440 --> 00:18:31.477 align:middle line:84%
at that time was
using technologies,

00:18:31.477 --> 00:18:34.346 align:middle line:84%
let's talk about the use of
technologies for the good

00:18:34.346 --> 00:18:36.782 align:middle line:84%
and for maybe the
not-so-positive.

00:18:36.782 --> 00:18:43.455 align:middle line:84%
We have a date from Edgar
Cayce of 5,722 year BCE --

00:18:43.455 --> 00:18:46.258 align:middle line:90%
or years ago, I'm not too sure,

00:18:46.258 --> 00:18:48.727 align:middle line:84%
when there was a
great conference,

00:18:48.727 --> 00:18:51.830 align:middle line:84%
a worldwide conference
because these groups,

00:18:51.830 --> 00:18:53.799 align:middle line:90%
these ancient civilizations,

00:18:53.799 --> 00:18:55.668 align:middle line:84%
were in communication
with each other.

00:18:55.668 --> 00:18:58.938 align:middle line:84%
There were great meetings in
Egypt, there were great meetings

00:18:58.938 --> 00:19:02.341 align:middle line:84%
in Atlantis and representatives
from around the world,

00:19:02.341 --> 00:19:06.912 align:middle line:84%
and this is hard for historians
and archeologists to swallow.

00:19:06.912 --> 00:19:09.315 align:middle line:84%
But you're talking about
telecommunications or...

00:19:09.315 --> 00:19:11.417 align:middle line:84%
And it could be on that
level, that's right.

00:19:11.417 --> 00:19:12.818 align:middle line:90%
There was some evidence...

00:19:12.818 --> 00:19:19.358 align:middle line:84%
But for Edgar Cayce I think he's
talking about actual meetings,

00:19:19.358 --> 00:19:21.994 align:middle line:84%
and that we had these
earlier civilizations

00:19:21.994 --> 00:19:24.997 align:middle line:84%
that just have been buried
and we can't find trace

00:19:24.997 --> 00:19:27.967 align:middle line:84%
of them anymore, and the
Greeks said the same thing,

00:19:27.967 --> 00:19:30.135 align:middle line:90%
that Zeus called the meeting,

00:19:30.135 --> 00:19:34.807 align:middle line:84%
and because people were going
away from their godlike selves

00:19:34.807 --> 00:19:40.346 align:middle line:84%
and were going into lower
material life forms and needed

00:19:40.346 --> 00:19:44.583 align:middle line:84%
to remember who they are,
not that the matter is lower

00:19:44.583 --> 00:19:45.884 align:middle line:90%
but they have to remember

00:19:45.884 --> 00:19:51.223 align:middle line:84%
that they have another existence
besides this existence.

00:19:51.223 --> 00:19:54.560 align:middle line:84%
So nudging back into the
technological age that developed

00:19:54.560 --> 00:19:57.396 align:middle line:84%
at that time, where Mu
was really more primitive

00:19:57.396 --> 00:19:58.397 align:middle line:90%
in terms of more...

00:19:58.397 --> 00:19:59.965 align:middle line:84%
Mu was not interested
in technology.

00:19:59.965 --> 00:20:02.434 align:middle line:84%
That's right, living more
in contact with just nature,

00:20:02.434 --> 00:20:03.702 align:middle line:90%
the divine principles of nature.

00:20:03.702 --> 00:20:05.304 align:middle line:84%
Mu was the land of
crystal power,

00:20:05.304 --> 00:20:07.873 align:middle line:84%
and I think Atlantis got
the crystal power from Mu.

00:20:07.873 --> 00:20:11.910 align:middle line:84%
Mu/Lemuria, because they were
in touch with each other.

00:20:11.910 --> 00:20:15.114 align:middle line:84%
How was it exploited
and utilized?

00:20:15.114 --> 00:20:18.317 align:middle line:84%
For Mu it's more a
culture of agriculture,

00:20:18.317 --> 00:20:22.287 align:middle line:84%
and it's more building of
simple temples and agriculture,

00:20:22.287 --> 00:20:25.357 align:middle line:90%
and no weaponry, no warfare.

00:20:25.357 --> 00:20:28.794 align:middle line:84%
And that's what we're finding
in ancient Peru right now,

00:20:28.794 --> 00:20:31.296 align:middle line:84%
all though we're still
early, they've had this hope

00:20:31.296 --> 00:20:33.699 align:middle line:84%
for many different
civilizations,

00:20:33.699 --> 00:20:35.534 align:middle line:90%
and like among the Maya,

00:20:35.534 --> 00:20:38.103 align:middle line:84%
and they say the Maya became
warlike too, but they have

00:20:38.103 --> 00:20:41.907 align:middle line:84%
to remember that the Maya were
invaded by the civilizations

00:20:41.907 --> 00:20:45.944 align:middle line:84%
of heartland of Mexico
and then they changed.

00:20:45.944 --> 00:20:50.816 align:middle line:84%
They were occupied,
and so what the --

00:20:50.816 --> 00:20:56.155 align:middle line:84%
Edgar Cayce said in that
year of 50,000 BC...

00:20:56.155 --> 00:20:57.723 align:middle line:90%
50,000 right?

00:20:57.723 --> 00:21:01.293 align:middle line:84%
... -- 52,000 years ago, I love
the number 52 because it fits

00:21:01.293 --> 00:21:03.629 align:middle line:90%
with the Mayan sacred numbers,

00:21:03.629 --> 00:21:06.098 align:middle line:84%
there was a threat
from large animals.

00:21:06.098 --> 00:21:09.968 align:middle line:84%
Certain environments were
threatened, and they began

00:21:09.968 --> 00:21:13.238 align:middle line:84%
to use the technology in
the crystal that they had

00:21:13.238 --> 00:21:17.009 align:middle line:84%
to develop weaponry
to change the climate.

00:21:17.009 --> 00:21:18.277 align:middle line:90%
To change the climate?

00:21:18.277 --> 00:21:21.346 align:middle line:84%
Much like people say that
things are going on today

00:21:21.346 --> 00:21:26.318 align:middle line:84%
that are happening with
chem trails and various --

00:21:26.318 --> 00:21:35.394 align:middle line:84%
shooting up rays into the
atmosphere for finding

00:21:36.729 --> 00:21:39.398 align:middle line:84%
out what's in the ionosphere
and how we can use it to spy

00:21:39.398 --> 00:21:43.669 align:middle line:84%
on other cultures and bombarding
it to see what will happen

00:21:43.669 --> 00:21:48.040 align:middle line:84%
so we can get -- so we
can get material gain.

00:21:48.040 --> 00:21:51.243 align:middle line:84%
Yes, and that's a
whole other subject.

00:21:51.243 --> 00:21:53.479 align:middle line:84%
So they were using
similar technologies

00:21:53.479 --> 00:21:56.882 align:middle line:84%
and you're saying now that they
were altering weather patterns

00:21:56.882 --> 00:22:01.186 align:middle line:84%
having to do with the roaming or
invasion of the larger animals?

00:22:01.186 --> 00:22:03.122 align:middle line:84%
Were those two somehow
linked then

00:22:03.122 --> 00:22:04.156 align:middle line:90%
to control those populations?

00:22:04.156 --> 00:22:05.858 align:middle line:84%
Some areas in their
colonies and parts

00:22:05.858 --> 00:22:08.961 align:middle line:84%
of Atlantis threatened
by larger animals.

00:22:08.961 --> 00:22:11.597 align:middle line:84%
We don't get into -- they
don't get into details

00:22:11.597 --> 00:22:13.332 align:middle line:84%
about what the large
animals are.

00:22:13.332 --> 00:22:16.735 align:middle line:90%
So I don't know what that is.

00:22:16.735 --> 00:22:20.506 align:middle line:84%
A person that I have a great
amount of respect for --

00:22:20.506 --> 00:22:24.910 align:middle line:84%
and I both used to be taken back
into past life into regressions

00:22:24.910 --> 00:22:28.680 align:middle line:84%
into these times and I have just
a smattering of experiences.

00:22:28.680 --> 00:22:30.849 align:middle line:84%
But I remember the
first one that she went

00:22:30.849 --> 00:22:37.689 align:middle line:84%
through she was there as a
guardian for the people --

00:22:37.689 --> 00:22:43.295 align:middle line:84%
the human beings to help keep
the animals separate from them,

00:22:43.295 --> 00:22:47.833 align:middle line:84%
the large human-like,
humanoid-type animals away

00:22:47.833 --> 00:22:51.270 align:middle line:84%
from them because they had
developed agricultural practices

00:22:51.270 --> 00:22:54.506 align:middle line:84%
so it was a draw, an
attraction to the other species

00:22:54.506 --> 00:22:57.276 align:middle line:84%
to come there, and they would
come and maraud and wipe

00:22:57.276 --> 00:23:00.445 align:middle line:84%
out the food supplies so
there was an attempt to try

00:23:00.445 --> 00:23:04.049 align:middle line:84%
to keep them kind of corralled
and moved into other areas,

00:23:04.049 --> 00:23:05.217 align:middle line:90%
so maybe that's part of this.

00:23:05.217 --> 00:23:08.353 align:middle line:84%
We have to think of
animal life forms and some

00:23:08.353 --> 00:23:15.060 align:middle line:84%
of it could be ethereal and
that they are guardians,

00:23:15.060 --> 00:23:19.298 align:middle line:84%
they were the guardians of the
previous creation number two,

00:23:19.298 --> 00:23:22.301 align:middle line:84%
and so they are always
our guardians but we have

00:23:22.301 --> 00:23:25.671 align:middle line:84%
to remember their strength;
when we pressure them

00:23:25.671 --> 00:23:28.373 align:middle line:84%
as maybe the Atlanteans
were pressuring them,

00:23:28.373 --> 00:23:33.745 align:middle line:84%
then they assume forms that
they don't want to assume

00:23:33.745 --> 00:23:37.649 align:middle line:84%
but they are empowered by
the earth, the mother earth

00:23:37.649 --> 00:23:39.818 align:middle line:90%
to assume a form to protect...

00:23:39.818 --> 00:23:41.053 align:middle line:90%
Which is interesting.

00:23:41.053 --> 00:23:42.888 align:middle line:84%
...because we're not
allowed to destroy the earth.

00:23:42.888 --> 00:23:45.524 align:middle line:84%
Right and that featured
prominently in a number

00:23:45.524 --> 00:23:46.825 align:middle line:90%
of readings is that,

00:23:46.825 --> 00:23:50.195 align:middle line:84%
in the early Atlantean times
the civilization was being

00:23:50.195 --> 00:23:54.333 align:middle line:84%
threatened and overrun by these
very large animals as sorts.

00:23:54.333 --> 00:23:55.701 align:middle line:84%
They don't describe
what they look like.

00:23:55.701 --> 00:23:58.670 align:middle line:84%
We're still doing research
on what the nature of that is

00:23:58.670 --> 00:24:00.706 align:middle line:84%
and I appreciate you
opening that for me

00:24:00.706 --> 00:24:03.275 align:middle line:90%
because I hadn't done that.

00:24:03.275 --> 00:24:05.544 align:middle line:84%
It just flashed through my mind
when you were talking about it

00:24:05.544 --> 00:24:07.512 align:middle line:84%
that she had seen that
in that regression.

00:24:07.512 --> 00:24:10.349 align:middle line:84%
Nobody can study everything,
it's too much, it's too much.

00:24:10.349 --> 00:24:13.385 align:middle line:84%
I'm hoping more people
will get into this study.

00:24:13.385 --> 00:24:15.654 align:middle line:84%
Well, and it's a matter of
putting the little pieces

00:24:15.654 --> 00:24:18.190 align:middle line:84%
of the puzzle together to
create a larger portrait.

00:24:18.190 --> 00:24:21.727 align:middle line:90%
So they also had the advantage

00:24:21.727 --> 00:24:27.032 align:middle line:84%
of electromagnetic technologies
they were mastering the use of

00:24:27.032 --> 00:24:29.301 align:middle line:84%
and even fission at that
time, as I understand?

00:24:29.301 --> 00:24:32.204 align:middle line:84%
Yes, and they were beginning to
master it and you have people

00:24:32.204 --> 00:24:37.075 align:middle line:84%
like Tesla that we had
in our history who began

00:24:37.075 --> 00:24:40.512 align:middle line:84%
to have amazing ideas
of using electricity

00:24:40.512 --> 00:24:44.049 align:middle line:84%
and it would be free,
using the earth as a wire.

00:24:44.049 --> 00:24:45.751 align:middle line:84%
And they were doing
that then already.

00:24:45.751 --> 00:24:48.954 align:middle line:84%
And that kind of person, his
records had to be expunged

00:24:48.954 --> 00:24:52.457 align:middle line:84%
and he had to be
eliminated so that people --

00:24:52.457 --> 00:24:57.262 align:middle line:84%
the scientists who were doing
this could be easily waylaid

00:24:57.262 --> 00:25:01.667 align:middle line:84%
in their attempts by people who
are trying to use the technology

00:25:01.667 --> 00:25:04.536 align:middle line:84%
and charge for it,
and become dominant

00:25:04.536 --> 00:25:07.406 align:middle line:84%
in the society becoming
the ones who deal

00:25:07.406 --> 00:25:08.941 align:middle line:90%
out the energy and the power.

00:25:08.941 --> 00:25:11.076 align:middle line:84%
Keeping a slave species
of sorts.

00:25:11.076 --> 00:25:12.611 align:middle line:90%
Yes, enslavement, yes.

00:25:12.611 --> 00:25:14.246 align:middle line:90%
To keep enslavement going.

00:25:14.246 --> 00:25:16.048 align:middle line:84%
So this started back
then, right?

00:25:16.048 --> 00:25:17.382 align:middle line:90%
Yes, it's a cycle.

00:25:17.382 --> 00:25:18.283 align:middle line:90%
It's a cycle.

00:25:18.283 --> 00:25:20.285 align:middle line:90%
It's what human beings do.

00:25:20.285 --> 00:25:22.521 align:middle line:84%
So everything we're
supposedly inventing

00:25:22.521 --> 00:25:25.090 align:middle line:84%
and discovering is really
only rediscovering because all

00:25:25.090 --> 00:25:26.992 align:middle line:84%
of us -- and we haven't
gotten as far

00:25:26.992 --> 00:25:28.994 align:middle line:84%
as those early Atlantean
civilizations.

00:25:28.994 --> 00:25:31.797 align:middle line:84%
Right now I think we're
approaching where Atlantis was,

00:25:31.797 --> 00:25:36.902 align:middle line:84%
we are quite there, and a
lot of Atlanteans are coming

00:25:36.902 --> 00:25:40.872 align:middle line:84%
into this lifetime because
they love it, they remember

00:25:40.872 --> 00:25:44.376 align:middle line:84%
and they want to come in here
and do that again and enjoy it,

00:25:44.376 --> 00:25:47.946 align:middle line:84%
even the abusing, an
they're free to do that.

00:25:47.946 --> 00:25:52.417 align:middle line:84%
Is it -- would you say in
your own understanding of it,

00:25:52.417 --> 00:25:55.954 align:middle line:84%
that the ones who come back or
who are posing as power elite

00:25:55.954 --> 00:26:00.092 align:middle line:84%
at this time have played
that role from that time --

00:26:00.092 --> 00:26:02.761 align:middle line:84%
from the Atlantean times forward
and this is the role they're...

00:26:02.761 --> 00:26:04.029 align:middle line:90%
Yes, they're replaying.

00:26:04.029 --> 00:26:06.365 align:middle line:84%
They're replaying their
role, and some of them are --

00:26:06.365 --> 00:26:10.769 align:middle line:84%
they don't want to wake up in
this lifetime, they like this

00:26:10.769 --> 00:26:14.406 align:middle line:84%
and they're allowed to do it,
and they're allowed to do it

00:26:14.406 --> 00:26:17.376 align:middle line:84%
because we have a
universe of worlds...

00:26:17.376 --> 00:26:22.914 align:middle line:84%
Yes. ...and so when they pass
there are millions and billions

00:26:22.914 --> 00:26:26.618 align:middle line:84%
of worlds where they can
go to as the next step

00:26:26.618 --> 00:26:29.121 align:middle line:90%
in their education in the hope

00:26:29.121 --> 00:26:31.957 align:middle line:84%
that they will choose
another route

00:26:31.957 --> 00:26:36.461 align:middle line:84%
because creation is an
invitation, it's synonymous

00:26:36.461 --> 00:26:38.497 align:middle line:90%
with the world "invitation".

00:26:38.497 --> 00:26:42.033 align:middle line:84%
We are invited to learn,
we are never forced.

00:26:42.033 --> 00:26:45.036 align:middle line:84%
It is open and it
will be spread out,

00:26:45.036 --> 00:26:48.874 align:middle line:84%
that's why the universe
is expanding, it is not --

00:26:48.874 --> 00:26:51.910 align:middle line:84%
it is not going backwards
as they thought,

00:26:51.910 --> 00:26:56.381 align:middle line:84%
it's getting larger because
we are making it larger.

00:26:56.381 --> 00:27:01.353 align:middle line:84%
We are creating these new worlds
because we're demanding more,

00:27:01.353 --> 00:27:05.357 align:middle line:84%
more fields to play
in for our evolution,

00:27:05.357 --> 00:27:07.893 align:middle line:84%
and whatever we demand
the creator will grant,

00:27:07.893 --> 00:27:09.261 align:middle line:90%
we are that precious.

00:27:09.261 --> 00:27:12.497 align:middle line:84%
And we had refined this creation
quite well in earthly forms

00:27:12.497 --> 00:27:14.733 align:middle line:84%
at that time, and
one of the areas

00:27:14.733 --> 00:27:17.502 align:middle line:84%
that has intrigued me is what
they were doing at the time

00:27:17.502 --> 00:27:21.006 align:middle line:84%
with agriculture, that part I
haven't seen us master yet in

00:27:21.006 --> 00:27:25.811 align:middle line:84%
that there was the use of
crystal and the use of crystal

00:27:25.811 --> 00:27:29.614 align:middle line:84%
as a light source, among --
as well as energy source,

00:27:29.614 --> 00:27:33.852 align:middle line:84%
where they were shining light
on the backside of the mountains

00:27:33.852 --> 00:27:37.389 align:middle line:84%
and growing extraordinary
produce, you could --

00:27:37.389 --> 00:27:39.891 align:middle line:84%
anywhere really, from
anywhere with the technology.

00:27:39.891 --> 00:27:41.660 align:middle line:84%
Yes, because they're
in the red lands,

00:27:41.660 --> 00:27:43.128 align:middle line:90%
they're in the place of feeling.

00:27:43.128 --> 00:27:46.231 align:middle line:84%
The Atlanteans could
feel the earth

00:27:46.231 --> 00:27:50.101 align:middle line:84%
and so they could use the
crystal power to help grow,

00:27:50.101 --> 00:27:55.974 align:middle line:84%
they could use their own minds
to open up the magical entities,

00:27:55.974 --> 00:27:58.477 align:middle line:84%
the fairies -- what
we call the fairies...

00:27:58.477 --> 00:27:59.845 align:middle line:90%
Yes, Divot Kingdom.

00:27:59.845 --> 00:28:03.748 align:middle line:84%
The magical parts and the
entities of the earth to grow,

00:28:03.748 --> 00:28:07.385 align:middle line:84%
they were very successful, they
-- Cayce, Edgar Cayce said,

00:28:07.385 --> 00:28:11.423 align:middle line:84%
"They reached very high
levels of production,

00:28:11.423 --> 00:28:14.593 align:middle line:84%
agricultural production
and civilization."

00:28:14.593 --> 00:28:18.697 align:middle line:84%
It's only in the later
times when they went awry

00:28:18.697 --> 00:28:24.336 align:middle line:84%
after the 50,000 -- 52,000
mark, when they started

00:28:24.336 --> 00:28:28.340 align:middle line:84%
to use the technology
in the wrong way,

00:28:28.340 --> 00:28:30.976 align:middle line:84%
they were using it
to destroy climate.

00:28:30.976 --> 00:28:34.679 align:middle line:84%
That's not their job, their
job is not to destroy,

00:28:34.679 --> 00:28:38.116 align:middle line:84%
and they got enamored with it,
and that was the beginning.

00:28:38.116 --> 00:28:41.853 align:middle line:84%
And then they started the
earth disturbances much more

00:28:41.853 --> 00:28:45.156 align:middle line:84%
than they could handle, and
then there were a series --

00:28:45.156 --> 00:28:50.195 align:middle line:84%
as most of the ARE
scholars now point to 52...

00:28:50.195 --> 00:28:50.862 align:middle line:90%
That's the Cayce scholars.

00:28:50.862 --> 00:28:52.697 align:middle line:90%
...and 26 and 13...

00:28:52.697 --> 00:28:55.734 align:middle line:84%
Those are the Mayan power
numbers, so I always consider it

00:28:55.734 --> 00:28:58.069 align:middle line:90%
in those, in that way.

00:28:58.069 --> 00:29:01.873 align:middle line:84%
So that, is there any
feeling of for how long

00:29:01.873 --> 00:29:05.810 align:middle line:84%
that culture existed before
the first takedown 52,

00:29:05.810 --> 00:29:07.012 align:middle line:90%
54,000 years ago?

00:29:07.012 --> 00:29:09.514 align:middle line:84%
Oh, the Atlantean culture
was going on thousands

00:29:09.514 --> 00:29:11.082 align:middle line:90%
of years before that,

00:29:11.082 --> 00:29:14.753 align:middle line:84%
Edgar Cayce is talking
about these key eras.

00:29:14.753 --> 00:29:18.590 align:middle line:84%
He talked most about the
key eras because he saw

00:29:18.590 --> 00:29:21.326 align:middle line:84%
that we were going through the
same one and the clients wanted

00:29:21.326 --> 00:29:26.631 align:middle line:84%
that information, so he
talked about why people came

00:29:26.631 --> 00:29:30.535 align:middle line:84%
in from Atlantis and
why people were working

00:29:30.535 --> 00:29:32.804 align:middle line:84%
in the electrical field,
became an engineer,

00:29:32.804 --> 00:29:35.106 align:middle line:90%
because you were that before.

00:29:35.106 --> 00:29:38.443 align:middle line:84%
And this time you want to
come around and do it again

00:29:38.443 --> 00:29:41.780 align:middle line:84%
and do it right, because
that is the whole key

00:29:41.780 --> 00:29:50.755 align:middle line:84%
of the Mayan way is they have
the mythology of Quetzalcoatl.

00:29:50.755 --> 00:29:54.993 align:middle line:84%
Quetzalcoatl is the
eternal priest king.

00:29:54.993 --> 00:30:01.766 align:middle line:84%
Quetzal means bird, blue-green
bird, and qoatl means snake.

00:30:01.766 --> 00:30:04.035 align:middle line:84%
The bird means the
knowledge of the skies

00:30:04.035 --> 00:30:06.204 align:middle line:84%
and the snake the
knowledge of the underworld,

00:30:06.204 --> 00:30:09.040 align:middle line:84%
the one who knows,
the priest-king.

00:30:09.040 --> 00:30:14.379 align:middle line:84%
And he defiled himself with
a little help from the --

00:30:14.379 --> 00:30:18.383 align:middle line:84%
from others, but he defiled
himself and he had part of it

00:30:18.383 --> 00:30:21.252 align:middle line:84%
and he had to leave,
he had to go,

00:30:21.252 --> 00:30:26.458 align:middle line:84%
and when he left it was a
big, "Goodbye, I will return."

00:30:26.458 --> 00:30:29.494 align:middle line:84%
The priest falls
and has to leave.

00:30:29.494 --> 00:30:33.665 align:middle line:84%
The Rayaw thing of one of
the previous incarnations

00:30:33.665 --> 00:30:37.268 align:middle line:84%
of Edgar Cayce is the
priest-king in Egypt

00:30:37.268 --> 00:30:43.908 align:middle line:84%
and he original had a wonderful,
miraculous civilization in Egypt

00:30:43.908 --> 00:30:46.811 align:middle line:84%
which came from Persia,
the older one,

00:30:46.811 --> 00:30:51.449 align:middle line:84%
and then he defiled
himself, married a relation,

00:30:51.449 --> 00:30:55.854 align:middle line:84%
too close of a relation, and too
young and so therefore he had

00:30:55.854 --> 00:31:00.792 align:middle line:84%
to leave, and so many
ancient civilizations talk

00:31:00.792 --> 00:31:02.727 align:middle line:90%
about the return of the priest.

00:31:02.727 --> 00:31:03.795 align:middle line:90%
The return of the priest, okay.

00:31:03.795 --> 00:31:05.930 align:middle line:90%
The return of the mature priest,

00:31:05.930 --> 00:31:10.769 align:middle line:84%
and that's what Mayan
mythology is all about,

00:31:10.769 --> 00:31:15.407 align:middle line:84%
spiritual immaturity
and spiritual maturity.

00:31:15.407 --> 00:31:18.276 align:middle line:84%
Okay, so let's go
-- let's go now

00:31:18.276 --> 00:31:22.814 align:middle line:84%
to how the priests were reigning
at that time in Atlantis

00:31:22.814 --> 00:31:26.251 align:middle line:84%
in that first one and then
let's move into 28,000

00:31:26.251 --> 00:31:28.987 align:middle line:84%
when the civilization
was first lost.

00:31:28.987 --> 00:31:31.356 align:middle line:84%
Yes. That portion of
the civilization is lost

00:31:31.356 --> 00:31:34.092 align:middle line:84%
and the migratory patterns
outward of the people.

00:31:34.092 --> 00:31:38.363 align:middle line:84%
Yes. Yes. The migratory
patterns from Atlantis,

00:31:38.363 --> 00:31:40.165 align:middle line:84%
Edgar Cayce said
they're all coming

00:31:40.165 --> 00:31:42.333 align:middle line:90%
through the Yucatan lands.

00:31:42.333 --> 00:31:45.603 align:middle line:84%
They're coming through Yucatan
and from there they're going

00:31:45.603 --> 00:31:52.377 align:middle line:84%
to Peru, the Atlanteans, and he
records all the mixtures, all --

00:31:52.377 --> 00:31:56.848 align:middle line:84%
it's mindboggling the amount of
migrations, you had Mu areas,

00:31:56.848 --> 00:31:59.451 align:middle line:90%
you had Atlantean areas,

00:31:59.451 --> 00:32:03.021 align:middle line:84%
and gradually you'll
see the influence

00:32:03.021 --> 00:32:06.291 align:middle line:84%
in the Peruvian cultures
like in Chavín de Huantar,

00:32:06.291 --> 00:32:10.595 align:middle line:84%
the great site of Peru which
was started off so beautifully

00:32:10.595 --> 00:32:16.267 align:middle line:84%
but then the Sons of Belial
got control and the art changes

00:32:16.267 --> 00:32:21.673 align:middle line:84%
and their trade system
changes and it becomes more --

00:32:21.673 --> 00:32:25.009 align:middle line:84%
and their temples change,
they get more limited access

00:32:25.009 --> 00:32:29.914 align:middle line:84%
by the nobility, it's no longer
-- it's no longer wide access.

00:32:29.914 --> 00:32:34.219 align:middle line:84%
Okay. They -- also, as I
recall reading in Cayce's work,

00:32:34.219 --> 00:32:37.355 align:middle line:84%
the other migration that
was occurring was occurring

00:32:37.355 --> 00:32:40.358 align:middle line:84%
eastward, where you're
talking about the engagement

00:32:40.358 --> 00:32:42.660 align:middle line:84%
of the Pyrenees and
Portugal and Spain.

00:32:42.660 --> 00:32:45.096 align:middle line:84%
That's right, and there was an
attempt and Plato recorded that,

00:32:45.096 --> 00:32:49.334 align:middle line:84%
the dialogues recorded that,
the attempt to take over the war

00:32:49.334 --> 00:32:52.504 align:middle line:84%
with Athens, and
the war with Egypt

00:32:52.504 --> 00:32:54.139 align:middle line:84%
and eventually they
were defeated

00:32:54.139 --> 00:32:56.407 align:middle line:84%
by an ancient Athens,
which is interesting.

00:32:56.407 --> 00:32:57.675 align:middle line:90%
It is interesting.

00:32:57.675 --> 00:32:59.644 align:middle line:84%
Okay. Now, so, my
mind's kind of going...

00:32:59.644 --> 00:33:01.112 align:middle line:90%
That's Plato's dialogues.

00:33:01.112 --> 00:33:06.484 align:middle line:84%
Yes, and let me go in a linear
fashion here, so then at 52,000,

00:33:06.484 --> 00:33:09.788 align:middle line:84%
we had a disruption, a
complete disruption of the land,

00:33:09.788 --> 00:33:12.390 align:middle line:84%
and a large portion of
early Atlantis was gone.

00:33:12.390 --> 00:33:14.159 align:middle line:90%
Of the Americas, yes.

00:33:14.159 --> 00:33:17.095 align:middle line:84%
Yeah. Okay, now the migration
had started people --

00:33:17.095 --> 00:33:18.496 align:middle line:84%
there was some forewarning,
I mean,

00:33:18.496 --> 00:33:19.664 align:middle line:90%
it didn't happen in an instant.

00:33:19.664 --> 00:33:21.900 align:middle line:84%
The migration was going
on all the way through,

00:33:21.900 --> 00:33:24.502 align:middle line:84%
and Edgar Cayce talked
about one particular one

00:33:24.502 --> 00:33:28.673 align:middle line:84%
that was very important and
that was the one led by Iltar

00:33:28.673 --> 00:33:31.609 align:middle line:90%
of the House of Astlan.

00:33:31.609 --> 00:33:34.546 align:middle line:84%
And he led about 10
individuals and he was --

00:33:34.546 --> 00:33:37.482 align:middle line:84%
what, building some
of the first temples

00:33:37.482 --> 00:33:41.486 align:middle line:84%
in the Yucatan Colony Land,
but that land is probably now

00:33:41.486 --> 00:33:44.689 align:middle line:84%
under the water, that's why
we went there in 12/12/12

00:33:44.689 --> 00:33:47.091 align:middle line:84%
with the crystal
skulls to get the --

00:33:47.091 --> 00:33:49.994 align:middle line:84%
to download the skulls
with that information.

00:33:49.994 --> 00:33:53.431 align:middle line:84%
Okay, now what was the
second iteration --

00:33:53.431 --> 00:33:56.267 align:middle line:84%
or the remaining
culture of Atlantis

00:33:56.267 --> 00:34:00.438 align:middle line:84%
after the first disappearance
of the landmass,

00:34:00.438 --> 00:34:02.707 align:middle line:84%
which took that culture
with it, that portion

00:34:02.707 --> 00:34:04.042 align:middle line:90%
of the culture with it.

00:34:04.042 --> 00:34:06.110 align:middle line:84%
That's right, and then the
islands became more separated

00:34:06.110 --> 00:34:10.648 align:middle line:84%
and smaller and then
wars, one to the other,

00:34:10.648 --> 00:34:12.283 align:middle line:90%
and different ones doing --

00:34:12.283 --> 00:34:15.352 align:middle line:84%
because the Atlanteans
were entrepreneurial,

00:34:15.352 --> 00:34:17.921 align:middle line:84%
very entrepreneurial,
more aggressive

00:34:17.921 --> 00:34:19.357 align:middle line:90%
than the Lemurians were.

00:34:19.357 --> 00:34:24.963 align:middle line:84%
You can see that when you
compare the west to the east,

00:34:24.963 --> 00:34:28.832 align:middle line:84%
there is a certain -- that's
why the Pacific is called

00:34:28.832 --> 00:34:30.301 align:middle line:90%
the Pacific.

00:34:30.301 --> 00:34:35.439 align:middle line:84%
It's much more -- there's
a much more placidness.

00:34:35.439 --> 00:34:36.808 align:middle line:90%
It's softer.

00:34:36.808 --> 00:34:40.445 align:middle line:84%
Softness there and a knowledge
of space in between people.

00:34:40.445 --> 00:34:43.281 align:middle line:84%
And even the remaining
cultures that dot along

00:34:43.281 --> 00:34:46.317 align:middle line:84%
in the Atlantic still have
that softness in connection

00:34:46.317 --> 00:34:49.553 align:middle line:84%
with the land and nature,
so now in the Atlantic area

00:34:49.553 --> 00:34:51.522 align:middle line:84%
where people have
spread both directions

00:34:51.522 --> 00:34:55.325 align:middle line:84%
and into the Americas
including into the Southwest.

00:34:55.325 --> 00:34:59.030 align:middle line:84%
Right, and you're going to
have colonies being established

00:34:59.030 --> 00:35:03.067 align:middle line:84%
in different places where it
was ripe and they could control

00:35:03.067 --> 00:35:06.404 align:middle line:84%
and then if they had a Lemurian
culture then the Atlanteans

00:35:06.404 --> 00:35:08.973 align:middle line:84%
would come in and
become the other faction

00:35:08.973 --> 00:35:10.675 align:middle line:84%
and then gradually
bring it down.

00:35:10.675 --> 00:35:13.478 align:middle line:84%
So Cayce's reading
for individuals,

00:35:13.478 --> 00:35:18.816 align:middle line:84%
over 14,000 readings, nobody
can read them all, but they talk

00:35:18.816 --> 00:35:21.052 align:middle line:90%
about gaining and losing.

00:35:21.052 --> 00:35:25.256 align:middle line:84%
You were one of the
priestesses in the temple there,

00:35:25.256 --> 00:35:28.660 align:middle line:84%
at first you did very
well and then you lost.

00:35:28.660 --> 00:35:31.296 align:middle line:84%
Yes, then the corruption
within happened.

00:35:31.296 --> 00:35:33.998 align:middle line:84%
The corruption, and
part of your sadness

00:35:33.998 --> 00:35:36.501 align:middle line:90%
in this life is for that reason.

00:35:36.501 --> 00:35:38.836 align:middle line:84%
Doesn't it seem like we're
always doing that even every --

00:35:38.836 --> 00:35:41.205 align:middle line:84%
I mean, we're always bumping
up against our boundaries

00:35:41.205 --> 00:35:43.207 align:middle line:90%
and doing course corrections.

00:35:43.207 --> 00:35:46.244 align:middle line:84%
Yes, and bumping up
against ourselves

00:35:46.244 --> 00:35:50.715 align:middle line:84%
because what we've done and
why we study this archeology

00:35:50.715 --> 00:35:54.185 align:middle line:84%
and this history is, because
our ancient selves have left

00:35:54.185 --> 00:35:56.754 align:middle line:90%
messages for ourselves knowing

00:35:56.754 --> 00:35:59.924 align:middle line:84%
that we will come
back and be reminded.

00:35:59.924 --> 00:36:03.161 align:middle line:84%
Yes. So it's spiritual
archeology.

00:36:03.161 --> 00:36:05.997 align:middle line:84%
So at this time in the
second portion that went

00:36:05.997 --> 00:36:10.201 align:middle line:84%
down in 28,000, you still had
high technology, they had things

00:36:10.201 --> 00:36:13.104 align:middle line:84%
like floating cars, they
understood gravity really well.

00:36:13.104 --> 00:36:15.139 align:middle line:90%
Yes, they had central source,

00:36:15.139 --> 00:36:20.411 align:middle line:84%
magnificently called the Tu'A'Oe
[phonetic spelling] Stone.

00:36:20.411 --> 00:36:21.946 align:middle line:90%
Now that sounds Lemurian to me.

00:36:21.946 --> 00:36:23.014 align:middle line:90%
Isn't' that the big crystal?

00:36:23.014 --> 00:36:25.283 align:middle line:84%
Yeah, the big crystal,
and it sound --

00:36:25.283 --> 00:36:28.252 align:middle line:84%
that's why I think the
Lemurian is the place

00:36:28.252 --> 00:36:29.620 align:middle line:90%
where the crystal comes from.

00:36:29.620 --> 00:36:31.022 align:middle line:90%
And they have flight.

00:36:31.022 --> 00:36:34.359 align:middle line:84%
And they used it and they used
it as a central power station

00:36:34.359 --> 00:36:38.096 align:middle line:84%
and it powered submarines
and airplanes, you name it,

00:36:38.096 --> 00:36:40.198 align:middle line:90%
and eventually weaponry.

00:36:40.198 --> 00:36:44.102 align:middle line:84%
Death ray -- Edgar Cayce talked
about the death ray that began.

00:36:44.102 --> 00:36:45.169 align:middle line:90%
That's right.

00:36:45.169 --> 00:36:46.637 align:middle line:84%
That was before the
science in this day

00:36:46.637 --> 00:36:47.972 align:middle line:90%
and age came about on that.

00:36:47.972 --> 00:36:49.107 align:middle line:90%
That's right.

00:36:49.107 --> 00:36:52.477 align:middle line:84%
That -- we're just
getting to that level now,

00:36:52.477 --> 00:36:55.480 align:middle line:84%
and congratulating
ourselves [laughter].

00:36:55.480 --> 00:36:58.416 align:middle line:84%
Yeah, like we've reached a
high level of advancement.

00:36:58.416 --> 00:37:00.385 align:middle line:84%
How was the death ray
used at that time,

00:37:00.385 --> 00:37:02.987 align:middle line:84%
because this really figures
into the destruction?

00:37:02.987 --> 00:37:07.125 align:middle line:84%
They used it to destroy
large animals

00:37:07.125 --> 00:37:09.894 align:middle line:84%
and at first what
they would talk --

00:37:09.894 --> 00:37:13.431 align:middle line:84%
I don't get this from Edgar
Cayce readings so I'm going

00:37:13.431 --> 00:37:16.634 align:middle line:84%
to jump here and say
I'm betting that some

00:37:16.634 --> 00:37:19.470 align:middle line:84%
of the colonies were
warring with other colonies,

00:37:19.470 --> 00:37:22.006 align:middle line:84%
and would use their
technology to win.

00:37:22.006 --> 00:37:24.976 align:middle line:84%
Okay, so it was essentially they
were kind of nuking -- yeah.

00:37:24.976 --> 00:37:26.911 align:middle line:84%
Yeah, and much the same
as the Greeks were doing.

00:37:26.911 --> 00:37:28.179 align:middle line:90%
Same thing.

00:37:28.179 --> 00:37:31.416 align:middle line:84%
They would go, they would
use the Oracle at Delphi,

00:37:31.416 --> 00:37:34.886 align:middle line:84%
that's one theory now, they
were using the Oracle at Delphi

00:37:34.886 --> 00:37:39.724 align:middle line:84%
as a major intelligence
point to inform people going

00:37:39.724 --> 00:37:43.361 align:middle line:84%
to Delphi Oracle and the
priest speaking behind,

00:37:43.361 --> 00:37:48.866 align:middle line:84%
it's not so pure sometimes, and
letting them know of information

00:37:48.866 --> 00:37:51.736 align:middle line:84%
where certain areas
less civilized

00:37:51.736 --> 00:37:55.273 align:middle line:84%
around the Mediterranean
are ripe for invasion

00:37:55.273 --> 00:37:58.643 align:middle line:84%
by certain city states,
entrepreneurial ones who want

00:37:58.643 --> 00:38:03.681 align:middle line:84%
to increase their power, because
Greece was not a central empire

00:38:03.681 --> 00:38:06.451 align:middle line:84%
and so -- and Atlantis
was breaking up

00:38:06.451 --> 00:38:08.953 align:middle line:84%
and so they were
not central anymore,

00:38:08.953 --> 00:38:11.222 align:middle line:90%
they used to be the ten kings

00:38:11.222 --> 00:38:15.793 align:middle line:84%
and then they had a unity among
them but the unity had broken

00:38:15.793 --> 00:38:19.163 align:middle line:84%
down and now they're fighting
with each other, and the Sons

00:38:19.163 --> 00:38:23.768 align:middle line:84%
of Belial are not a single
entity either, they are --

00:38:23.768 --> 00:38:28.706 align:middle line:84%
they are different
because the islands

00:38:28.706 --> 00:38:31.409 align:middle line:90%
as the destruction advanced,

00:38:31.409 --> 00:38:35.413 align:middle line:84%
in the separate islands there
were separate governments

00:38:35.413 --> 00:38:38.616 align:middle line:84%
formed, but Cayce I
think is mainly talking

00:38:38.616 --> 00:38:40.518 align:middle line:84%
about the main island
of Poseidia.

00:38:40.518 --> 00:38:41.986 align:middle line:90%
Yes, right.

00:38:41.986 --> 00:38:45.089 align:middle line:84%
And so as I understand
it from the readings,

00:38:45.089 --> 00:38:49.360 align:middle line:84%
by a very large increment this
connection with the spirit

00:38:49.360 --> 00:38:51.529 align:middle line:84%
and the spiritual
understandings kept declining

00:38:51.529 --> 00:38:53.364 align:middle line:84%
with each destruction
of Atlantis.

00:38:53.364 --> 00:38:56.567 align:middle line:84%
Correct, it was time
for them to fall.

00:38:56.567 --> 00:38:58.469 align:middle line:84%
There is the invitation,
there is the hope

00:38:58.469 --> 00:39:02.306 align:middle line:84%
that they can wake up, but a
resonance has to be created

00:39:02.306 --> 00:39:03.808 align:middle line:84%
between the followers
of the one,

00:39:03.808 --> 00:39:08.246 align:middle line:84%
which we're doing right now, we
have to network with each other,

00:39:08.246 --> 00:39:12.416 align:middle line:84%
we have to talk with this
resonance, we have to remember.

00:39:12.416 --> 00:39:17.021 align:middle line:84%
We have to become a member
of ourselves again, remember,

00:39:17.021 --> 00:39:20.625 align:middle line:84%
to become a member
again, of each other,

00:39:20.625 --> 00:39:25.096 align:middle line:84%
and stop letting other forces
from the top separate us

00:39:25.096 --> 00:39:27.532 align:middle line:84%
into little groups through
fear and competition.

00:39:27.532 --> 00:39:31.335 align:middle line:84%
This has been carried out
now for hundreds of thousands

00:39:31.335 --> 00:39:32.270 align:middle line:90%
of years and going on.

00:39:32.270 --> 00:39:33.337 align:middle line:90%
Divide and conquer, yeah.

00:39:33.337 --> 00:39:35.807 align:middle line:84%
And we have an opportunity
-- absolutely.

00:39:35.807 --> 00:39:38.009 align:middle line:84%
I had the experience
with Dolores Cannon

00:39:38.009 --> 00:39:40.478 align:middle line:84%
of doing a past life
regression at one time,

00:39:40.478 --> 00:39:42.446 align:middle line:84%
had no idea where I
was going to end up,

00:39:42.446 --> 00:39:44.715 align:middle line:84%
I just know what I went
for, which was a --

00:39:44.715 --> 00:39:47.818 align:middle line:90%
some kind of damage that I felt

00:39:47.818 --> 00:39:50.721 align:middle line:84%
like my heart had been really
hampered at some point,

00:39:50.721 --> 00:39:53.157 align:middle line:84%
assuming it might be a little
love affair in the past,

00:39:53.157 --> 00:39:56.661 align:middle line:84%
went right back to the final
days of one of the epoch periods

00:39:56.661 --> 00:39:59.964 align:middle line:84%
in Atlantis and the one thing
that I noticed is when --

00:39:59.964 --> 00:40:02.567 align:middle line:84%
and I was working at
that time with energy,

00:40:02.567 --> 00:40:05.703 align:middle line:84%
we worked with the mind, it
was females in a temple setting

00:40:05.703 --> 00:40:08.372 align:middle line:84%
as opposed to the
males predominantly

00:40:08.372 --> 00:40:10.808 align:middle line:84%
but not entirely working
with the great crystal

00:40:10.808 --> 00:40:13.477 align:middle line:84%
and the energy sources outside
which I didn't really have a lot

00:40:13.477 --> 00:40:16.147 align:middle line:84%
of awareness of because
we were cloistered.

00:40:16.147 --> 00:40:19.483 align:middle line:84%
So I only had what I would
hear and what we could see.

00:40:19.483 --> 00:40:24.355 align:middle line:84%
But when it was over, and
this was the final day,

00:40:24.355 --> 00:40:26.958 align:middle line:84%
and the sadness was so
dense, we had been trying

00:40:26.958 --> 00:40:31.429 align:middle line:84%
to hold the energy as others
had for decades upon decades,

00:40:31.429 --> 00:40:33.931 align:middle line:84%
and we were about
in our mid-200s,

00:40:33.931 --> 00:40:36.167 align:middle line:84%
we were like a 32-year-old
today,

00:40:36.167 --> 00:40:39.537 align:middle line:84%
but we were 250 years old,
roughly, the point was

00:40:39.537 --> 00:40:42.340 align:middle line:84%
after it all went
down, you could see --

00:40:42.340 --> 00:40:45.776 align:middle line:84%
I assume it was a nuclear type
of thing because the fish,

00:40:45.776 --> 00:40:48.579 align:middle line:84%
I could see them belly up
and boiling in the waters,

00:40:48.579 --> 00:40:52.183 align:middle line:84%
and I didn't stay for the
actual meltdown, I was there

00:40:52.183 --> 00:40:54.919 align:middle line:84%
but I didn't choose to
look at it, went beyond it,

00:40:54.919 --> 00:40:58.289 align:middle line:84%
the thing that struck
me, I kept saying to her,

00:40:58.289 --> 00:41:00.091 align:middle line:90%
"How could we have done this?"

00:41:00.091 --> 00:41:03.527 align:middle line:84%
Because we have ruined
the very delicate matrix

00:41:03.527 --> 00:41:06.197 align:middle line:84%
that has been created between
ourselves, and the sun.

00:41:06.197 --> 00:41:09.367 align:middle line:84%
So it was cosmological on one
level, and then I was saying

00:41:09.367 --> 00:41:12.336 align:middle line:84%
that in seeing, I kept
saying, "We have to go to sleep

00:41:12.336 --> 00:41:14.705 align:middle line:84%
for a very long time now,"
because there would be no --

00:41:14.705 --> 00:41:16.641 align:middle line:84%
there would be no
incentive to incarnate

00:41:16.641 --> 00:41:18.142 align:middle line:84%
if we could remember
what we just lost.

00:41:18.142 --> 00:41:21.979 align:middle line:84%
And those voices
were, "Go to sleep,"

00:41:21.979 --> 00:41:25.116 align:middle line:84%
was to encrypt the
information in the crystal.

00:41:25.116 --> 00:41:26.350 align:middle line:90%
Interesting!

00:41:26.350 --> 00:41:28.552 align:middle line:84%
Encrypt themselves, an
ethereal part of themselves

00:41:28.552 --> 00:41:30.988 align:middle line:84%
into the crystal, and
that's what the crystal

00:41:30.988 --> 00:41:32.323 align:middle line:90%
skull represents.

00:41:32.323 --> 00:41:34.358 align:middle line:84%
Okay, now, this skull, this
skull you're speaking of --

00:41:34.358 --> 00:41:38.729 align:middle line:84%
Earth Keeper, came to you
when I met you in 11/11/11,

00:41:38.729 --> 00:41:40.898 align:middle line:90%
and you didn't ask for it.

00:41:40.898 --> 00:41:45.569 align:middle line:84%
A man from Germany and a
lady from Peru came up to me

00:41:45.569 --> 00:41:46.937 align:middle line:90%
and they said this --

00:41:46.937 --> 00:41:50.174 align:middle line:84%
I was lecturing just on these
very subjects and they said,

00:41:50.174 --> 00:41:52.710 align:middle line:84%
"He wants to be on the
table while you're talking."

00:41:52.710 --> 00:41:55.813 align:middle line:84%
So I said, "Okay, put him
on the table," then later

00:41:55.813 --> 00:41:58.683 align:middle line:84%
on at four o'clock I was done
lecturing, they came back

00:41:58.683 --> 00:42:01.252 align:middle line:84%
and they said, "He still
wants to be with you.

00:42:01.252 --> 00:42:05.389 align:middle line:84%
Would you please
become his caretaker?"

00:42:05.389 --> 00:42:08.559 align:middle line:84%
I had told my wife,
one will come to us

00:42:08.559 --> 00:42:12.630 align:middle line:84%
and sure enough it was -- that's
the most powerful sign to me,

00:42:12.630 --> 00:42:17.301 align:middle line:84%
and it's a sign of what we
can get and what we can expect

00:42:17.301 --> 00:42:21.305 align:middle line:84%
because we're so precious,
following the spirit of us,

00:42:21.305 --> 00:42:24.775 align:middle line:84%
we will be given gifts,
we will be given help

00:42:24.775 --> 00:42:27.311 align:middle line:90%
and clear signs, unmistakable.

00:42:27.311 --> 00:42:30.081 align:middle line:90%
So let's talk about him.

00:42:30.081 --> 00:42:30.715 align:middle line:90%
I want to...

00:42:30.715 --> 00:42:31.749 align:middle line:90%
Yes. Earth Keeper.

00:42:31.749 --> 00:42:33.150 align:middle line:84%
-- ... before we end
this conversation,

00:42:33.150 --> 00:42:37.054 align:middle line:84%
we still have time, I want to
talk about what happened during

00:42:37.054 --> 00:42:41.392 align:middle line:84%
that phase of instability where
there was again, a leaping off

00:42:41.392 --> 00:42:43.694 align:middle line:84%
and an exodus to other
parts of the world,

00:42:43.694 --> 00:42:46.897 align:middle line:84%
especially into Egypt
from Atlantis.

00:42:46.897 --> 00:42:49.200 align:middle line:84%
Those two cultures
started clashing.

00:42:49.200 --> 00:42:50.534 align:middle line:90%
Yes. Right.

00:42:50.534 --> 00:42:52.303 align:middle line:84%
Before we go there, just give
us a little bit of an idea

00:42:52.303 --> 00:42:55.272 align:middle line:84%
of what the Earth Keeper's
skull has been bringing

00:42:55.272 --> 00:42:57.541 align:middle line:90%
by way of memory.

00:42:57.541 --> 00:43:01.412 align:middle line:84%
It's in my life, he has
started to form my life,

00:43:01.412 --> 00:43:05.683 align:middle line:84%
he/she has started to form
my life and Noby's life.

00:43:05.683 --> 00:43:06.951 align:middle line:90%
Your wife Noby.

00:43:06.951 --> 00:43:09.553 align:middle line:84%
Immediately we were
drawn towards Peru,

00:43:09.553 --> 00:43:12.456 align:middle line:84%
because I was engaged not
just with the Earth Keeper,

00:43:12.456 --> 00:43:15.426 align:middle line:84%
but with the Mitchell
Hedges skull, that was found

00:43:15.426 --> 00:43:19.497 align:middle line:84%
in Lubaantun on the east
coast of the Yucatan

00:43:19.497 --> 00:43:22.133 align:middle line:90%
and it is a site unusual.

00:43:22.133 --> 00:43:25.903 align:middle line:84%
It's more like a Peruvian site,
no mortar between the stones,

00:43:25.903 --> 00:43:31.509 align:middle line:84%
build like the pyramids of
Caral Supe in ancient Peru,

00:43:31.509 --> 00:43:34.578 align:middle line:84%
and Peru is older, the
archeological evidence is coming

00:43:34.578 --> 00:43:37.448 align:middle line:84%
out older, all though that's
not for sure because a lot

00:43:37.448 --> 00:43:39.650 align:middle line:84%
of land sunk in the
Yucatan off there.

00:43:39.650 --> 00:43:43.287 align:middle line:84%
So he's taking you -- he's been
guiding you that direction,

00:43:43.287 --> 00:43:45.122 align:middle line:84%
of course you don't know where
you're going to be guided next,

00:43:45.122 --> 00:43:47.758 align:middle line:84%
but the intelligence of
it is pulling you forward

00:43:47.758 --> 00:43:49.460 align:middle line:84%
and pulling you into deeper
understanding in each of these?

00:43:49.460 --> 00:43:51.262 align:middle line:84%
And then being sensitive
enough to realize --

00:43:51.262 --> 00:43:54.398 align:middle line:84%
then my daughter marries
a guy from Peru, Dennis,

00:43:54.398 --> 00:43:57.735 align:middle line:84%
and all of a sudden I
am going to Peru again.

00:43:57.735 --> 00:43:59.437 align:middle line:84%
So maybe your skull's
a matchmaker.

00:43:59.437 --> 00:44:03.073 align:middle line:84%
I'm studying about Peru
and because I'm being led

00:44:03.073 --> 00:44:07.178 align:middle line:84%
in my study to another
place, the Mu/Lemurian place.

00:44:07.178 --> 00:44:09.146 align:middle line:90%
Peru is much more Mu/Lemurian.

00:44:09.146 --> 00:44:10.815 align:middle line:90%
Right. And so I'm led

00:44:10.815 --> 00:44:13.417 align:middle line:84%
to a deeper level
in a sense of smell.

00:44:13.417 --> 00:44:16.654 align:middle line:84%
Yes. It's almost like I have
to awaken a sense of smell

00:44:16.654 --> 00:44:22.827 align:middle line:84%
that I have and you will have
accidents in your life, your --

00:44:22.827 --> 00:44:25.729 align:middle line:84%
everything is so part of
the plan of revelation,

00:44:25.729 --> 00:44:28.999 align:middle line:84%
every sickness that you
have is designed by you.

00:44:28.999 --> 00:44:31.702 align:middle line:84%
So in the Mayan calendar
reading, a person says,

00:44:31.702 --> 00:44:35.139 align:middle line:84%
"I've been having trouble with
my nose, I've had allergies

00:44:35.139 --> 00:44:38.642 align:middle line:84%
and everything," I said,
"That's because you assigned

00:44:38.642 --> 00:44:41.812 align:middle line:84%
that to yourself, that's
the help given to you

00:44:41.812 --> 00:44:46.283 align:middle line:84%
so that a great resonant center
and a memory can be awakened

00:44:46.283 --> 00:44:48.786 align:middle line:90%
in that area, and that has to do

00:44:48.786 --> 00:44:52.356 align:middle line:84%
with Mu/Lemuria and
study Mu/Lemuria.

00:44:52.356 --> 00:44:55.059 align:middle line:84%
This is what the Mayan
calendar reading does.

00:44:55.059 --> 00:45:00.097 align:middle line:84%
If it's an injury to the ear and
so therefore the five places,

00:45:00.097 --> 00:45:04.368 align:middle line:84%
you have a powerful lifetime
at that time, and I didn't used

00:45:04.368 --> 00:45:08.639 align:middle line:84%
to do this until I
got Earth Keeper.

00:45:08.639 --> 00:45:10.674 align:middle line:90%
It's different, it's different

00:45:10.674 --> 00:45:13.777 align:middle line:84%
because ancient memories
are coming out of there

00:45:13.777 --> 00:45:15.679 align:middle line:84%
and you're a part
of it, you're --

00:45:15.679 --> 00:45:17.581 align:middle line:84%
you put yourself
into that crystal.

00:45:17.581 --> 00:45:18.649 align:middle line:90%
You mean when you're sitting

00:45:18.649 --> 00:45:19.817 align:middle line:84%
with somebody doing
a reading, you mean?

00:45:19.817 --> 00:45:20.918 align:middle line:90%
The three of you?

00:45:20.918 --> 00:45:22.453 align:middle line:84%
It's coming right out
of there through me,

00:45:22.453 --> 00:45:26.157 align:middle line:84%
and so I advise everyone
to get a crystal skull.

00:45:26.157 --> 00:45:29.493 align:middle line:84%
A small one or big one, it
doesn't make any difference.

00:45:29.493 --> 00:45:30.828 align:middle line:90%
Get one, have one.

00:45:30.828 --> 00:45:33.564 align:middle line:84%
And it doesn't matter that
it was just carved yesterday?

00:45:33.564 --> 00:45:37.535 align:middle line:84%
Get a -- crystal is crystal,
it's all millions of years old.

00:45:37.535 --> 00:45:42.606 align:middle line:84%
It was all there and it's all
planned to be there not only

00:45:42.606 --> 00:45:47.044 align:middle line:84%
for our technology but for the
original reason it came was

00:45:47.044 --> 00:45:51.849 align:middle line:84%
to help us with communication
with other dimensions,

00:45:51.849 --> 00:45:54.318 align:middle line:84%
it's a help, it's
almost like a Christ.

00:45:54.318 --> 00:45:57.021 align:middle line:84%
It's a vehicle of the Christ,
and the ancient memories

00:45:57.021 --> 00:46:01.492 align:middle line:84%
of all the souls who, like
yourself, who appear and had

00:46:01.492 --> 00:46:03.761 align:middle line:90%
to go away, couldn't stand it.

00:46:03.761 --> 00:46:06.797 align:middle line:84%
Where would be the place
for the ethereal beings

00:46:06.797 --> 00:46:09.934 align:middle line:90%
to go, but inside crystal?

00:46:09.934 --> 00:46:13.404 align:middle line:84%
It came out in a
Superman movies, remember?

00:46:13.404 --> 00:46:16.740 align:middle line:90%
It's in our memory; it's there.

00:46:16.740 --> 00:46:21.111 align:middle line:84%
So the Atlanteans were
very crystal-based for good

00:46:21.111 --> 00:46:22.213 align:middle line:90%
and for negative --

00:46:22.213 --> 00:46:23.914 align:middle line:84%
for destructive and
for healing purposes.

00:46:23.914 --> 00:46:26.650 align:middle line:84%
Some of it was used in
their great healing halls,

00:46:26.650 --> 00:46:29.486 align:middle line:84%
for example, which were very
sophisticated forms of healing.

00:46:29.486 --> 00:46:31.855 align:middle line:84%
Edward Cayce talked a lot
about that, about the temple,

00:46:31.855 --> 00:46:34.959 align:middle line:84%
beautiful, and the
temple of sacrifice

00:46:34.959 --> 00:46:38.562 align:middle line:84%
and where people
were eliminating some

00:46:38.562 --> 00:46:42.866 align:middle line:84%
of their animal parts,
I guess to be more

00:46:42.866 --> 00:46:48.238 align:middle line:84%
into the fourth creation, to
be more part of it, the --

00:46:48.238 --> 00:46:52.643 align:middle line:84%
the only thing is it became
-- civilization was coming,

00:46:52.643 --> 00:46:55.679 align:middle line:84%
have to be aware of
what civilizations

00:46:55.679 --> 00:46:59.183 align:middle line:84%
and what beings Edgar Cayce is
talking to at the time, too,

00:46:59.183 --> 00:47:02.820 align:middle line:84%
to eliminate the parts,
it's a purification.

00:47:02.820 --> 00:47:07.758 align:middle line:84%
Edgar Cayce is not an infallible
source, he met other beings

00:47:07.758 --> 00:47:12.363 align:middle line:84%
up there called Halileel for
example who said other things,

00:47:12.363 --> 00:47:16.867 align:middle line:84%
and he said -- and Cayce
didn't -- would just --

00:47:16.867 --> 00:47:19.036 align:middle line:84%
is just a transmitter
of information,

00:47:19.036 --> 00:47:21.839 align:middle line:84%
and it's up to individual
people --

00:47:21.839 --> 00:47:25.042 align:middle line:84%
there's no right or
wrong in Edgar Cayce.

00:47:25.042 --> 00:47:27.911 align:middle line:84%
There is just read it and
see what your heart says.

00:47:27.911 --> 00:47:30.547 align:middle line:84%
Well, and didn't each person
attract the source it needed

00:47:30.547 --> 00:47:32.549 align:middle line:84%
for its information that
was given in that way

00:47:32.549 --> 00:47:34.251 align:middle line:84%
because maybe there was
a previous relationship?

00:47:34.251 --> 00:47:36.820 align:middle line:84%
We have the wonderful
Metatron in our age,

00:47:36.820 --> 00:47:38.088 align:middle line:90%
giving out information.

00:47:38.088 --> 00:47:39.423 align:middle line:90%
We have  The Skull Speaks ,

00:47:39.423 --> 00:47:43.761 align:middle line:84%
which is a book I highly
recommend by Carol Wilson-Davis,

00:47:43.761 --> 00:47:45.929 align:middle line:84%
who talked about --
who did readings,

00:47:45.929 --> 00:47:50.334 align:middle line:84%
she was a famous psychic in
Canada, and she did readings

00:47:50.334 --> 00:47:54.138 align:middle line:84%
in the 1980's with the
Mitchell Hedges skull,

00:47:54.138 --> 00:47:56.440 align:middle line:84%
and when you read it
you'll see Edgar --

00:47:56.440 --> 00:47:58.642 align:middle line:84%
the resonance of
Edgar Cayce is there.

00:47:58.642 --> 00:48:02.279 align:middle line:84%
When the last -- the last time
-- before the final destruction

00:48:02.279 --> 00:48:04.181 align:middle line:84%
of Atlantis my understanding
is one

00:48:04.181 --> 00:48:06.684 align:middle line:84%
of the last remaining
physical places

00:48:06.684 --> 00:48:09.653 align:middle line:84%
of Atlantis is actually
a peak in the Azores,

00:48:09.653 --> 00:48:13.257 align:middle line:84%
and there are others too, but
there are remaining little pits,

00:48:13.257 --> 00:48:17.094 align:middle line:84%
now Edgar Cayce and other beings
have said during the period

00:48:17.094 --> 00:48:19.496 align:middle line:84%
of history around now,
and everybody's off

00:48:19.496 --> 00:48:23.233 align:middle line:84%
on it a little bit, that
Atlantis will be rising again.

00:48:23.233 --> 00:48:26.370 align:middle line:84%
So there is something key
about that, but let's talk

00:48:26.370 --> 00:48:30.407 align:middle line:84%
about the migration to Egypt and
then what happened spiritually

00:48:30.407 --> 00:48:34.178 align:middle line:84%
with the -- initially,
clash of knowledge and power

00:48:34.178 --> 00:48:37.214 align:middle line:84%
that were taking place from
the Atlantean tribes coming

00:48:37.214 --> 00:48:40.017 align:middle line:84%
in to what was existing
in Egypt at that time.

00:48:40.017 --> 00:48:42.886 align:middle line:84%
Yes. How did those
two begin integrating?

00:48:42.886 --> 00:48:45.089 align:middle line:84%
Because no one really
understands ancient

00:48:45.089 --> 00:48:46.423 align:middle line:90%
Egyptian history.

00:48:46.423 --> 00:48:49.526 align:middle line:84%
Well, the Atlantean tribes
are coming in with the Greeks,

00:48:49.526 --> 00:48:53.197 align:middle line:84%
the Greek invasion,
Alexander, so their form

00:48:53.197 --> 00:48:56.100 align:middle line:84%
of spirituality is
coming through,

00:48:56.100 --> 00:49:00.804 align:middle line:84%
and so the ancient knowledge
of Egypt had to go underground.

00:49:00.804 --> 00:49:04.908 align:middle line:84%
And that ancient
knowledge is in the Sufis.

00:49:04.908 --> 00:49:06.043 align:middle line:90%
Oh, interesting.

00:49:06.043 --> 00:49:08.612 align:middle line:84%
Because later on there
was another conquest,

00:49:08.612 --> 00:49:13.016 align:middle line:84%
the Arab conquest of Egypt,
so it's way underground and

00:49:13.016 --> 00:49:17.387 align:middle line:84%
yet the Sufis are very
powerful, still alive

00:49:17.387 --> 00:49:20.457 align:middle line:84%
and still there and
without borders.

00:49:20.457 --> 00:49:24.294 align:middle line:84%
And there is a story, the
ancient story of the Sufis

00:49:24.294 --> 00:49:28.632 align:middle line:84%
that they -- when Mohammad
was alive, they came to him,

00:49:28.632 --> 00:49:31.502 align:middle line:90%
the ancient people, Mu/Lemurian

00:49:31.502 --> 00:49:35.139 align:middle line:84%
and the High Atlantean
Knowledge people, the Followers

00:49:35.139 --> 00:49:39.042 align:middle line:84%
of the One, came to
Mohammad, and they talked

00:49:39.042 --> 00:49:42.980 align:middle line:84%
about their beliefs and
Mohammad said not a word.

00:49:42.980 --> 00:49:49.219 align:middle line:84%
This is a legend now, Mohammad
did not speak, but assented

00:49:49.219 --> 00:49:52.923 align:middle line:84%
with his eye, and that's
why the Sufi are still

00:49:52.923 --> 00:49:54.558 align:middle line:90%
within that realm.

00:49:54.558 --> 00:49:55.926 align:middle line:90%
Aha, okay.

00:49:55.926 --> 00:49:59.496 align:middle line:84%
So it's very -- we have to look
at that, and realize we have

00:49:59.496 --> 00:50:01.064 align:middle line:90%
to look carefully about --

00:50:01.064 --> 00:50:06.103 align:middle line:84%
in the world and see the little
things that are going on,

00:50:06.103 --> 00:50:09.072 align:middle line:84%
not sometimes the great
movements but the movements

00:50:09.072 --> 00:50:12.509 align:middle line:84%
in between them, and there
you will find the followers

00:50:12.509 --> 00:50:14.077 align:middle line:90%
of the one.

00:50:14.077 --> 00:50:19.016 align:middle line:84%
Okay, so that takes us in more
modern history, we have Rumi

00:50:19.016 --> 00:50:22.386 align:middle line:84%
for example, who celebrated
the Sufi tradition.

00:50:22.386 --> 00:50:23.720 align:middle line:90%
December 17th.

00:50:23.720 --> 00:50:28.091 align:middle line:84%
December 17th, the wedding
day of Rumi's spirit and body,

00:50:28.091 --> 00:50:32.196 align:middle line:84%
and this -- I mean, if
we're looking for kind

00:50:32.196 --> 00:50:37.134 align:middle line:84%
of modern literature to turn
to that we can relate to,

00:50:37.134 --> 00:50:39.102 align:middle line:90%
the beauty and resonance

00:50:39.102 --> 00:50:42.706 align:middle line:84%
in the Rumi writings might be
a good place for us to turn

00:50:42.706 --> 00:50:46.910 align:middle line:84%
if we're looking for the
ancient Lemurian teachings?

00:50:46.910 --> 00:50:49.213 align:middle line:84%
Yes, and their ceremonies,
when they moved,

00:50:49.213 --> 00:50:53.283 align:middle line:84%
the whirling dervishes,
moving in the same direction

00:50:53.283 --> 00:50:57.888 align:middle line:84%
as the earth, getting in tune
with the earth, not mind,

00:50:57.888 --> 00:51:01.492 align:middle line:84%
getting in tune with the
earth and open that mind,

00:51:01.492 --> 00:51:05.863 align:middle line:84%
because as Einstein said,
"All I did was study.

00:51:05.863 --> 00:51:08.098 align:middle line:84%
I just studied and
kept the mind open.

00:51:08.098 --> 00:51:09.666 align:middle line:90%
I read -- " In the patent office

00:51:09.666 --> 00:51:13.337 align:middle line:84%
in Switzerland he read
every conceivable theory,

00:51:13.337 --> 00:51:17.307 align:middle line:84%
and then he would be walking by
a river, or walking in the town

00:51:17.307 --> 00:51:19.776 align:middle line:90%
and all of a sudden, boom!

00:51:19.776 --> 00:51:24.681 align:middle line:84%
He said, "It came to me in full
form, like music came to Mozart.

00:51:24.681 --> 00:51:27.150 align:middle line:90%
It came -- it's not mine.

00:51:27.150 --> 00:51:30.921 align:middle line:84%
It was never mine; I
just readied the mind

00:51:30.921 --> 00:51:35.726 align:middle line:84%
so that the heart would trust
me with it and send it up."

00:51:35.726 --> 00:51:38.395 align:middle line:90%
Yes. And that's the key to us.

00:51:38.395 --> 00:51:44.034 align:middle line:84%
So in looking at the
information that's surfacing,

00:51:44.034 --> 00:51:48.205 align:middle line:84%
all of this from all these
different sources, we seem to be

00:51:48.205 --> 00:51:49.640 align:middle line:90%
at a turning point once again.

00:51:49.640 --> 00:51:52.309 align:middle line:84%
As you said, a lot of
the technology is --

00:51:52.309 --> 00:51:54.978 align:middle line:84%
it hasn't fully been
recovered, we're not really --

00:51:54.978 --> 00:51:56.880 align:middle line:90%
maybe Black Ops in the military,

00:51:56.880 --> 00:51:59.650 align:middle line:84%
but for public consumption we're
not using a lot of anti-gravity

00:51:59.650 --> 00:52:02.519 align:middle line:84%
and such just yet, all though
it is being done behind

00:52:02.519 --> 00:52:03.887 align:middle line:90%
closed doors.

00:52:03.887 --> 00:52:06.256 align:middle line:84%
It's pretty tough, it's a pretty
tough environment right now,

00:52:06.256 --> 00:52:09.593 align:middle line:84%
and we're -- you're going to
see a lot of falling down,

00:52:09.593 --> 00:52:13.430 align:middle line:84%
that's what I got from the
12/12/12 trip is there's a lot

00:52:13.430 --> 00:52:16.867 align:middle line:84%
of falling down, and
you look for signs.

00:52:16.867 --> 00:52:20.103 align:middle line:90%
You will see storms appearing,

00:52:20.103 --> 00:52:22.873 align:middle line:84%
you will see earthquakes
appearing,

00:52:22.873 --> 00:52:24.541 align:middle line:90%
but they will not be --

00:52:24.541 --> 00:52:30.614 align:middle line:84%
my testimony coming from Egypt
coming when I was in Egypt

00:52:30.614 --> 00:52:33.617 align:middle line:84%
and doing a Mayan ceremony in
front of the Great Pyramid,

00:52:33.617 --> 00:52:36.920 align:middle line:90%
a boy fell off one of the blocks

00:52:36.920 --> 00:52:39.923 align:middle line:84%
and I was just doing the
ceremony and I looked up,

00:52:39.923 --> 00:52:44.428 align:middle line:84%
I heard the screaming, he
was limping, he was okay,

00:52:44.428 --> 00:52:48.966 align:middle line:84%
and so that was a sign to me,
and then later on in the hotel,

00:52:48.966 --> 00:52:53.036 align:middle line:84%
two nights later I was
doing a Mayan ceremony

00:52:53.036 --> 00:52:58.041 align:middle line:84%
and three feet behind me a
woman fell, she just plopped

00:52:58.041 --> 00:53:01.845 align:middle line:84%
onto the ground and
she had no --

00:53:01.845 --> 00:53:05.983 align:middle line:84%
apparently there was no
epilepsy, she said, "No,

00:53:05.983 --> 00:53:09.653 align:middle line:84%
I don't have epilepsy,"
but she survived.

00:53:09.653 --> 00:53:12.622 align:middle line:84%
That's metaphorical for
what you were -- yeah.

00:53:12.622 --> 00:53:14.591 align:middle line:90%
That's how signs come.

00:53:14.591 --> 00:53:17.361 align:middle line:84%
So it was a falling
down but a survival?

00:53:17.361 --> 00:53:18.895 align:middle line:90%
That's what I'm getting.

00:53:18.895 --> 00:53:21.565 align:middle line:84%
We're going to get
minor adjustments.

00:53:21.565 --> 00:53:23.166 align:middle line:84%
I'm glad of that
because as I said

00:53:23.166 --> 00:53:25.469 align:middle line:84%
to you before, I'm
involved here.

00:53:25.469 --> 00:53:26.837 align:middle line:90%
[Laughter] Yes.

00:53:26.837 --> 00:53:28.972 align:middle line:84%
I always say in my lectures,
"I'm into minor adjustments,"

00:53:28.972 --> 00:53:30.907 align:middle line:84%
because I think new
souls are coming,

00:53:30.907 --> 00:53:32.576 align:middle line:84%
I think we're getting
a lot of help.

00:53:32.576 --> 00:53:35.178 align:middle line:84%
Think of all the people
that work with animals,

00:53:35.178 --> 00:53:38.815 align:middle line:84%
that work with plants,
all the channelers

00:53:38.815 --> 00:53:39.916 align:middle line:90%
that are coming through.

00:53:39.916 --> 00:53:41.351 align:middle line:90%
"We didn't see this number!"

00:53:41.351 --> 00:53:43.820 align:middle line:90%
The internet is loaded now!

00:53:43.820 --> 00:53:46.490 align:middle line:84%
Before Edgar Cayce
was a standard

00:53:46.490 --> 00:53:49.926 align:middle line:84%
in the theosophical
society they stood alone!

00:53:49.926 --> 00:53:51.061 align:middle line:90%
And so when I was

00:53:51.061 --> 00:53:55.499 align:middle line:84%
at the 11/11/11 Crystal
Skull Convention I said,

00:53:55.499 --> 00:53:58.535 align:middle line:84%
"How are young people
attracted to crystal skulls?"

00:53:58.535 --> 00:53:59.903 align:middle line:90%
Yes. More than old people.

00:53:59.903 --> 00:54:01.371 align:middle line:90%
Right. So it's a vehicle.

00:54:01.371 --> 00:54:04.474 align:middle line:84%
And so I said, "How many people
have heard of Edgar Cayce?"

00:54:04.474 --> 00:54:06.743 align:middle line:90%
90% raised their hand.

00:54:06.743 --> 00:54:08.111 align:middle line:90%
So that's how I knew.

00:54:08.111 --> 00:54:13.350 align:middle line:84%
Stay with that organization
because they are a foundation,

00:54:13.350 --> 00:54:16.286 align:middle line:84%
a stake driven into
the ground for memory.

00:54:16.286 --> 00:54:18.555 align:middle line:84%
And as you say, this
memory is rising,

00:54:18.555 --> 00:54:20.724 align:middle line:84%
it's coming up through
all these different means,

00:54:20.724 --> 00:54:22.325 align:middle line:84%
we're remembering
the opportunity

00:54:22.325 --> 00:54:23.727 align:middle line:90%
to reconnect directly,

00:54:23.727 --> 00:54:27.364 align:middle line:84%
vertically with our other
dimensional aspects which are,

00:54:27.364 --> 00:54:32.002 align:middle line:84%
as you say, noble, beautiful
creators, and simultaneously,

00:54:32.002 --> 00:54:34.805 align:middle line:84%
if we want to assign
separation and names to it,

00:54:34.805 --> 00:54:39.376 align:middle line:84%
The Sons of Belial are
also offering mass trauma

00:54:39.376 --> 00:54:40.644 align:middle line:90%
and hypnosis.

00:54:40.644 --> 00:54:42.012 align:middle line:90%
The Hollywood depictions

00:54:42.012 --> 00:54:46.016 align:middle line:84%
of our future are absolutely
catastrophic, devastating,

00:54:46.016 --> 00:54:49.352 align:middle line:84%
apocalyptic visions,
and television shows,

00:54:49.352 --> 00:54:51.421 align:middle line:84%
this is being reinforced
that we're going to go

00:54:51.421 --> 00:54:53.557 align:middle line:84%
through a total collapse
of civilization.

00:54:53.557 --> 00:54:57.327 align:middle line:84%
Fear breed control, Machiavelli
said it a long time ago,

00:54:57.327 --> 00:55:03.467 align:middle line:84%
it is -- the underside of
statecraft is that to control

00:55:03.467 --> 00:55:07.804 align:middle line:84%
and to make people afraid,
and create an elite,

00:55:07.804 --> 00:55:11.041 align:middle line:84%
and the society will fall,
it will become top heavy.

00:55:11.041 --> 00:55:14.678 align:middle line:84%
As a philosopher, how do
you -- how do you view --

00:55:14.678 --> 00:55:18.181 align:middle line:84%
I mean there's an obvious level
to it, how do you view that game

00:55:18.181 --> 00:55:23.620 align:middle line:84%
of programming the public
to expect an apocalypse?

00:55:23.620 --> 00:55:30.327 align:middle line:84%
It is more in the -- it is more
in the Eurasian field than it is

00:55:30.327 --> 00:55:34.231 align:middle line:84%
in the Mayan field, for the
Maya it's a natural cycle,

00:55:34.231 --> 00:55:35.866 align:middle line:84%
it's just going to
occur again and again,

00:55:35.866 --> 00:55:40.570 align:middle line:84%
from the Eurasian field it's
a straight line evolution

00:55:40.570 --> 00:55:43.173 align:middle line:84%
through history, the history
of salvation, it's called --

00:55:43.173 --> 00:55:48.845 align:middle line:84%
for the Maya we are invited
again and again, we can stop it.

00:55:48.845 --> 00:55:50.747 align:middle line:90%
It's an invitation to stopping,

00:55:50.747 --> 00:55:53.717 align:middle line:84%
if we can network
with each other.

00:55:53.717 --> 00:55:56.553 align:middle line:84%
If we can -- as the
early Christians said,

00:55:56.553 --> 00:55:58.622 align:middle line:90%
they were one community.

00:55:58.622 --> 00:56:01.591 align:middle line:84%
It's when they started to get
into the state and make it

00:56:01.591 --> 00:56:04.427 align:middle line:84%
into a state religion
and state precepts

00:56:04.427 --> 00:56:05.929 align:middle line:90%
that it starts to go down.

00:56:05.929 --> 00:56:11.268 align:middle line:84%
It is a grassroots thing,
and then we succeed.

00:56:11.268 --> 00:56:18.141 align:middle line:84%
And right now, looking
around, sadly these --

00:56:18.141 --> 00:56:22.612 align:middle line:84%
all the human beings, these
beautiful individual creators

00:56:22.612 --> 00:56:25.649 align:middle line:84%
and souls that are all
equal to each other.

00:56:25.649 --> 00:56:28.685 align:middle line:84%
I mean, just, if you're
going to put a label on it,

00:56:28.685 --> 00:56:31.755 align:middle line:90%
it looks like more than 90%-98%

00:56:31.755 --> 00:56:34.891 align:middle line:84%
of human beings are
allowing these other forces

00:56:34.891 --> 00:56:36.226 align:middle line:90%
to control them.

00:56:36.226 --> 00:56:39.029 align:middle line:84%
Many people watching this,
we've all been subject to that.

00:56:39.029 --> 00:56:41.264 align:middle line:84%
We're all coming out
of our forgetfulness,

00:56:41.264 --> 00:56:43.266 align:middle line:84%
that long sleep I
spoke about earlier.

00:56:43.266 --> 00:56:44.100 align:middle line:90%
How do we...

00:56:44.100 --> 00:56:45.468 align:middle line:90%
And it's been a critical few.

00:56:45.468 --> 00:56:47.470 align:middle line:84%
Yes. It doesn't have
to be the majority;

00:56:47.470 --> 00:56:50.407 align:middle line:84%
it can be just a
critical few that do it,

00:56:50.407 --> 00:56:54.477 align:middle line:84%
that can create a network
and a resonance that all

00:56:54.477 --> 00:56:56.012 align:middle line:90%
of a sudden, they're feeling it!

00:56:56.012 --> 00:56:58.081 align:middle line:84%
They don't know where
it's coming from.

00:56:58.081 --> 00:57:00.984 align:middle line:84%
They feel it and they go,
"Something else is afoot."

00:57:00.984 --> 00:57:06.423 align:middle line:84%
It destabilizes them and in the
Mayan ball game is a metaphor

00:57:06.423 --> 00:57:08.325 align:middle line:90%
for the battle to be fought.

00:57:08.325 --> 00:57:11.161 align:middle line:84%
It is a -- even when
the odds are stacked

00:57:11.161 --> 00:57:15.665 align:middle line:84%
against you ten million to one,
the creator loves that the best

00:57:15.665 --> 00:57:20.103 align:middle line:84%
when you have the gall,
the guts to make a play.

00:57:20.103 --> 00:57:21.504 align:middle line:90%
Help will come.

00:57:21.504 --> 00:57:24.774 align:middle line:84%
We're not to consider the
forces arrayed against us,

00:57:24.774 --> 00:57:26.876 align:middle line:84%
we're only to fulfill
our mission

00:57:26.876 --> 00:57:29.913 align:middle line:84%
and we're doing it right
now with this program.

00:57:29.913 --> 00:57:34.718 align:middle line:84%
So we have just a minute or so
left, any kind of final thoughts

00:57:34.718 --> 00:57:38.889 align:middle line:84%
that you would like to share
regarding reclaiming the mind,

00:57:38.889 --> 00:57:40.123 align:middle line:90%
reclaiming the self, the soul?

00:57:40.123 --> 00:57:43.727 align:middle line:84%
To reclaim the mind is to
go into your own study.

00:57:43.727 --> 00:57:46.129 align:middle line:84%
Begin studying where
your passion is,

00:57:46.129 --> 00:57:47.664 align:middle line:90%
I don't care where it is.

00:57:47.664 --> 00:57:50.233 align:middle line:84%
If it's golf, be a
golf professional,

00:57:50.233 --> 00:57:53.937 align:middle line:84%
if you can't be the great golf
player be in the golf business.

00:57:53.937 --> 00:57:56.673 align:middle line:84%
But study it completely
and utterly,

00:57:56.673 --> 00:57:59.542 align:middle line:84%
that study of golf will lead
you right to the spiritual.

00:57:59.542 --> 00:58:02.646 align:middle line:84%
Everything goes to the
spiritual at bottom,

00:58:02.646 --> 00:58:07.017 align:middle line:84%
and you can do your work and you
can be the expert in that area.

00:58:07.017 --> 00:58:10.086 align:middle line:84%
You will not look for jobs;
the job will come looking

00:58:10.086 --> 00:58:11.788 align:middle line:90%
for you when you study.

00:58:11.788 --> 00:58:13.189 align:middle line:90%
You control the world.

00:58:13.189 --> 00:58:14.557 align:middle line:90%
That makes sense.

00:58:14.557 --> 00:58:18.428 align:middle line:84%
When you put your complete soul,
your passion into anything,

00:58:18.428 --> 00:58:21.531 align:middle line:84%
now you have a vibrant planet,
and you need golf professionals

00:58:21.531 --> 00:58:22.766 align:middle line:90%
as much as you need...

00:58:22.766 --> 00:58:24.200 align:middle line:84%
And you'll be at a party
and you'll mention something

00:58:24.200 --> 00:58:25.869 align:middle line:84%
that the person has
not heard before

00:58:25.869 --> 00:58:27.037 align:middle line:90%
and they'll say, "I want you."

00:58:27.037 --> 00:58:28.171 align:middle line:90%
That's how it works.

00:58:28.171 --> 00:58:29.072 align:middle line:84%
That's because you're
involved in your life,

00:58:29.072 --> 00:58:30.206 align:middle line:90%
and so any expression...

00:58:30.206 --> 00:58:31.574 align:middle line:84%
That's right, because
you have the passion.

00:58:31.574 --> 00:58:32.809 align:middle line:90%
It's a resonance.

00:58:32.809 --> 00:58:35.045 align:middle line:84%
So whether you're a mother,
whether you're a lawyer,

00:58:35.045 --> 00:58:36.579 align:middle line:90%
it doesn't matter what we are.

00:58:36.579 --> 00:58:38.648 align:middle line:84%
You're saying involve
your passion completely
