00:00:08.143 --> 00:00:09.503 align:middle line:90%


00:00:09.503 --> 00:00:11.170 align:middle line:84%
- I've done thousands
of these readings,

00:00:11.170 --> 00:00:13.420 align:middle line:84%
and throughout I've noticed
certain health trends

00:00:13.420 --> 00:00:14.860 align:middle line:90%
with certain star lineages.

00:00:14.860 --> 00:00:17.530 align:middle line:84%
We start off from a
very high place, then

00:00:17.530 --> 00:00:19.030 align:middle line:90%
like an inverted bell curve.

00:00:19.030 --> 00:00:21.250 align:middle line:84%
Each incarnation, we
go lower and lower

00:00:21.250 --> 00:00:22.640 align:middle line:90%
and lower and dimension.

00:00:22.640 --> 00:00:25.030 align:middle line:84%
And then they start
developing these conditions.

00:00:25.030 --> 00:00:27.760 align:middle line:84%
And they're wondering, how
come nobody can help me?

00:00:27.760 --> 00:00:29.590 align:middle line:84%
If they come to see
me, I can explain

00:00:29.590 --> 00:00:30.820 align:middle line:90%
what's going on with them.

00:00:30.820 --> 00:00:31.330 align:middle line:90%
- Right.

00:00:31.330 --> 00:00:32.950 align:middle line:84%
Now we have something
called an "AS."

00:00:32.950 --> 00:00:34.300 align:middle line:90%
- "AS," yeah.

00:00:34.300 --> 00:00:38.740 align:middle line:84%
We came from civilizations
where food wasn't ingested.

00:00:38.740 --> 00:00:41.890 align:middle line:84%
Arcturians along with the
Andromeda in star seeds

00:00:41.890 --> 00:00:45.820 align:middle line:84%
probably have the roughest time
as far as physical illnesses.

00:00:45.820 --> 00:00:46.960 align:middle line:90%
- Onto Orion.

00:00:46.960 --> 00:00:47.800 align:middle line:90%
- Orion.

00:00:47.800 --> 00:00:48.685 align:middle line:90%
Oh, yeah, Orion.

00:00:48.685 --> 00:00:52.760 align:middle line:90%

REGINA MEREDITH: Today
is Debbie Solaris.

00:00:54.590 --> 00:00:57.200 align:middle line:10%
Debbie transitioned
from government employee

00:00:57.200 --> 00:01:00.470 align:middle line:10%
to a cosmic translator of
sorts, helping people understand

00:01:00.470 --> 00:01:01.970 align:middle line:10%
their potential origins.

00:01:01.970 --> 00:01:04.730 align:middle line:10%
Today we're going to talk
about the health complications

00:01:04.730 --> 00:01:08.310 align:middle line:10%
of being on Earth, if you're a
hybrid from another off planet

00:01:08.310 --> 00:01:09.110 align:middle line:10%
culture.

00:01:09.110 --> 00:01:10.550 align:middle line:90%
Welcome back, Debbie.

00:01:10.550 --> 00:01:12.100 align:middle line:90%
We're doing a regular thing now.

00:01:12.100 --> 00:01:12.500 align:middle line:90%
DEBBIE SOLARIS: I know.

00:01:12.500 --> 00:01:14.990 align:middle line:84%
REGINA: You're around everywhere
now on all kinds of shows.

00:01:14.990 --> 00:01:15.815 align:middle line:90%
I love it.

00:01:15.815 --> 00:01:17.190 align:middle line:84%
SOLARIS: Thank
you for having me.

00:01:17.190 --> 00:01:18.510 align:middle line:90%
And I'm excited to be back.

00:01:18.510 --> 00:01:19.310 align:middle line:90%
Thanks.

00:01:19.310 --> 00:01:19.670 align:middle line:90%
Thanks.

00:01:19.670 --> 00:01:20.600 align:middle line:90%
Thank you so much.

00:01:20.600 --> 00:01:22.760 align:middle line:84%
REGINA: Yeah, and it's
interesting because when

00:01:22.760 --> 00:01:25.130 align:middle line:84%
we very first met I
thought, are people

00:01:25.130 --> 00:01:26.720 align:middle line:90%
going to relate to this story?

00:01:26.720 --> 00:01:28.850 align:middle line:90%
Will the audiences relate?

00:01:28.850 --> 00:01:32.180 align:middle line:84%
Oh my gosh, they eat
it up with a big spoon

00:01:32.180 --> 00:01:35.150 align:middle line:84%
because something in us is
telling us that we're not

00:01:35.150 --> 00:01:36.410 align:middle line:90%
hearing the whole story.

00:01:36.410 --> 00:01:36.740 align:middle line:90%
SOLARIS: Exactly.

00:01:36.740 --> 00:01:38.573 align:middle line:84%
REGINA: And you're
helping people understand

00:01:38.573 --> 00:01:40.580 align:middle line:84%
there's much more to
the complexity of what

00:01:40.580 --> 00:01:41.690 align:middle line:90%
it is to be human.

00:01:41.690 --> 00:01:42.620 align:middle line:90%
SOLARIS: Absolutely.

00:01:42.620 --> 00:01:45.440 align:middle line:84%
And I feel like
it's my life's work

00:01:45.440 --> 00:01:49.670 align:middle line:84%
to help connect people who
they are, where they came from,

00:01:49.670 --> 00:01:52.050 align:middle line:84%
and why we're all
here right now.

00:01:52.050 --> 00:01:52.850 align:middle line:90%
REGINA: Yes.

00:01:52.850 --> 00:01:55.640 align:middle line:84%
And if anyone wants to look
at the very beginning of how

00:01:55.640 --> 00:01:59.510 align:middle line:84%
we laid this foundation, you can
go back to the Gaia archives,

00:01:59.510 --> 00:02:02.630 align:middle line:84%
and people can go back and take
a look at our first interview.

00:02:02.630 --> 00:02:04.460 align:middle line:84%
It gets into your
background, who you are.

00:02:04.460 --> 00:02:06.050 align:middle line:84%
We're not going to go
over that again today.

00:02:06.050 --> 00:02:06.440 align:middle line:90%
SOLARIS: Yeah.

00:02:06.440 --> 00:02:07.460 align:middle line:90%
Thank you.

00:02:07.460 --> 00:02:09.189 align:middle line:84%
REGINA: We're just going to
go right on with the story.

00:02:09.189 --> 00:02:09.989 align:middle line:90%
SOLARIS: Yeah.

00:02:09.989 --> 00:02:12.980 align:middle line:84%
REGINA: So first
of all, how is it

00:02:12.980 --> 00:02:16.070 align:middle line:84%
help us to understand
our star lineage in terms

00:02:16.070 --> 00:02:18.370 align:middle line:90%
of our bodies and our health?

00:02:18.370 --> 00:02:20.870 align:middle line:84%
Because I know we've got a lot
of health complications going

00:02:20.870 --> 00:02:21.890 align:middle line:90%
on around the planet.

00:02:21.890 --> 00:02:22.723 align:middle line:90%
SOLARIS: Absolutely.

00:02:22.723 --> 00:02:25.640 align:middle line:84%
REGINA: Everybody is allergic
to something or everything now.

00:02:25.640 --> 00:02:29.510 align:middle line:10%
SOLARIS: Well, I've done Akashic
readings for quite a few years

00:02:29.510 --> 00:02:33.140 align:middle line:10%
now of, say, about a
decade, and I've done

00:02:33.140 --> 00:02:34.370 align:middle line:10%
thousands of these readings.

00:02:34.370 --> 00:02:35.828 align:middle line:84%
And throughout
these readings, I've

00:02:35.828 --> 00:02:38.390 align:middle line:84%
noticed certain health trends
with certain star lineages.

00:02:38.390 --> 00:02:41.010 align:middle line:90%


00:02:41.010 --> 00:02:44.030 align:middle line:10%
And I get a lot of questions
from my clients about health.

00:02:44.030 --> 00:02:47.270 align:middle line:10%
Like, hey, I don't feel great.

00:02:47.270 --> 00:02:49.340 align:middle line:90%
How can I heal?

00:02:49.340 --> 00:02:51.360 align:middle line:90%
How can I improve?

00:02:51.360 --> 00:02:55.610 align:middle line:84%
How can I become my most
vital energetic self?

00:02:55.610 --> 00:02:58.970 align:middle line:84%
And it's also been
part of my own journey

00:02:58.970 --> 00:03:02.300 align:middle line:84%
because as many
people probably know,

00:03:02.300 --> 00:03:05.510 align:middle line:84%
I also went through a massive
health transformation myself.

00:03:05.510 --> 00:03:08.510 align:middle line:84%
I did have some
allopathic medicine help,

00:03:08.510 --> 00:03:12.500 align:middle line:84%
but I also utilize
some of these trends

00:03:12.500 --> 00:03:14.480 align:middle line:84%
I was seeing in the
"Akashic records"

00:03:14.480 --> 00:03:20.365 align:middle line:84%
and starting to use some of them
with my own health journeys.

00:03:20.365 --> 00:03:22.490 align:middle line:84%
REGINA: I don't know that
I've ever asked you this.

00:03:22.490 --> 00:03:23.290 align:middle line:90%
SOLARIS: Yeah.

00:03:23.290 --> 00:03:25.070 align:middle line:84%
REGINA: So where's
your original place?

00:03:25.070 --> 00:03:27.290 align:middle line:90%
Where's your place of origin?

00:03:27.290 --> 00:03:29.300 align:middle line:84%
SOLARIS: I'm actually an
Arcturian in Star seed.

00:03:29.300 --> 00:03:31.610 align:middle line:90%
So I am from Arcturus.

00:03:31.610 --> 00:03:34.590 align:middle line:84%
But I've had incarnations, I
think, in quite a few systems.

00:03:34.590 --> 00:03:35.390 align:middle line:90%
REGINA: Yes.

00:03:35.390 --> 00:03:36.190 align:middle line:90%
Yeah, yeah.

00:03:36.190 --> 00:03:37.040 align:middle line:90%
SOLARIS: Yeah.

00:03:37.040 --> 00:03:37.520 align:middle line:90%
REGINA: OK, good.

00:03:37.520 --> 00:03:39.540 align:middle line:84%
I just-- it just occurred to
me I never asked you that.

00:03:39.540 --> 00:03:39.846 align:middle line:90%
SOLARIS: Yeah, yeah.

00:03:39.846 --> 00:03:39.950 align:middle line:90%
Absolutely.

00:03:39.950 --> 00:03:40.985 align:middle line:90%
REGINA: Everybody but you.

00:03:40.985 --> 00:03:41.785 align:middle line:90%
SOLARIS: Yeah.

00:03:41.785 --> 00:03:43.460 align:middle line:84%
REGINA: OK, so you
say that what's

00:03:43.460 --> 00:03:46.460 align:middle line:84%
happening with our
bodies physically is also

00:03:46.460 --> 00:03:49.250 align:middle line:84%
tied to where we're
going as a species

00:03:49.250 --> 00:03:53.600 align:middle line:84%
and where we're changing our
frequencies and in some terms

00:03:53.600 --> 00:03:55.047 align:middle line:90%
you can say ascension.

00:03:55.047 --> 00:03:55.880 align:middle line:90%
SOLARIS: Absolutely.

00:03:55.880 --> 00:03:57.410 align:middle line:84%
REGINA: But what
we're moving into

00:03:57.410 --> 00:03:59.390 align:middle line:90%
vibrationally as a species.

00:03:59.390 --> 00:04:01.130 align:middle line:84%
Let's talk about
that for a minute,

00:04:01.130 --> 00:04:03.560 align:middle line:90%
how health is playing into this.

00:04:03.560 --> 00:04:04.780 align:middle line:90%
SOLARIS: Absolutely.

00:04:04.780 --> 00:04:08.300 align:middle line:84%
Well, what's happening is that
a lot of people are awakening

00:04:08.300 --> 00:04:11.790 align:middle line:84%
and as they're awakening,
energetically, they're

00:04:11.790 --> 00:04:12.590 align:middle line:90%
upgrading.

00:04:12.590 --> 00:04:18.230 align:middle line:84%
So their energetic field is
no longer a vibrational match

00:04:18.230 --> 00:04:20.480 align:middle line:90%
to their physical bodies.

00:04:20.480 --> 00:04:25.100 align:middle line:84%
And so then they start
developing inconsistencies

00:04:25.100 --> 00:04:27.800 align:middle line:84%
between these frequencies
that cause either

00:04:27.800 --> 00:04:30.500 align:middle line:90%
ascension symptoms, which--

00:04:30.500 --> 00:04:33.350 align:middle line:84%
REGINA: Now we have something
called ascension systems?

00:04:33.350 --> 00:04:34.730 align:middle line:90%
I have AS.

00:04:34.730 --> 00:04:35.690 align:middle line:90%
SOLARIS: You have AS.

00:04:35.690 --> 00:04:36.950 align:middle line:90%
Yeah, exactly, yes.

00:04:36.950 --> 00:04:37.910 align:middle line:90%
REGINA: I love it.

00:04:37.910 --> 00:04:39.110 align:middle line:84%
SOLARIS: Ascension
symptoms, yeah.

00:04:39.110 --> 00:04:39.920 align:middle line:90%
REGINA: We'll get into that.

00:04:39.920 --> 00:04:42.620 align:middle line:84%
We'll continue what you're
saying, and then get into "AS."

00:04:42.620 --> 00:04:45.560 align:middle line:90%
SOLARIS: "AS," yeah.

00:04:45.560 --> 00:04:49.940 align:middle line:84%
So ascension
symptoms are symptoms

00:04:49.940 --> 00:04:55.460 align:middle line:84%
that occur that can be
disconcerting because you just

00:04:55.460 --> 00:04:56.690 align:middle line:90%
feel off.

00:04:56.690 --> 00:04:58.880 align:middle line:84%
And a lot of times it happens
because we're shifting

00:04:58.880 --> 00:05:00.000 align:middle line:90%
in and out of dimension.

00:05:00.000 --> 00:05:03.590 align:middle line:84%
So a lot of star
seeds and lightworkers

00:05:03.590 --> 00:05:09.170 align:middle line:84%
actually reside in higher
fourth and mid-fourth dimension,

00:05:09.170 --> 00:05:11.750 align:middle line:84%
but then we have to
pull our vibrations down

00:05:11.750 --> 00:05:13.130 align:middle line:90%
to third dimension.

00:05:13.130 --> 00:05:17.270 align:middle line:84%
And it causes a lot of
incongruence with how we feel.

00:05:17.270 --> 00:05:22.760 align:middle line:84%
But my main concern is the
actual physical illnesses.

00:05:22.760 --> 00:05:26.420 align:middle line:84%
So what is it that really
are chronic diseases

00:05:26.420 --> 00:05:32.210 align:middle line:84%
or chronic illnesses that are
causing people to feel off

00:05:32.210 --> 00:05:34.130 align:middle line:90%
or not feeling their best?

00:05:34.130 --> 00:05:39.030 align:middle line:84%
REGINA: So, OK, so one time when
I was looking at all of this,

00:05:39.030 --> 00:05:42.080 align:middle line:84%
I was doing a meditation
and just talking

00:05:42.080 --> 00:05:43.920 align:middle line:84%
with my guides for
a moment and saying,

00:05:43.920 --> 00:05:45.980 align:middle line:84%
what's going on
with the human body?

00:05:45.980 --> 00:05:52.562 align:middle line:84%
And one thing I was shown is
that part of these digestive

00:05:52.562 --> 00:05:54.020 align:middle line:84%
goes right with
what you're saying.

00:05:54.020 --> 00:05:54.820 align:middle line:90%
SOLARIS: Yeah.

00:05:54.820 --> 00:05:56.320 align:middle line:90%
REGINA: Died several years ago.

00:05:56.320 --> 00:05:57.910 align:middle line:84%
Part of these
digestive issues were

00:05:57.910 --> 00:06:02.500 align:middle line:84%
because the human digestive
system, as we know it,

00:06:02.500 --> 00:06:05.950 align:middle line:84%
is going to begin
atrophying and to not handle

00:06:05.950 --> 00:06:09.250 align:middle line:84%
dense large amounts of food
and that we, in the future,

00:06:09.250 --> 00:06:12.160 align:middle line:84%
would be moving into a
more liquid-based and

00:06:12.160 --> 00:06:16.270 align:middle line:90%
phytonutrient-based diet.

00:06:16.270 --> 00:06:18.295 align:middle line:84%
When you think about
it, that makes sense.

00:06:18.295 --> 00:06:19.095 align:middle line:90%
SOLARIS: Totally.

00:06:19.095 --> 00:06:21.070 align:middle line:84%
REGINA: If we were to
each one is shutting down

00:06:21.070 --> 00:06:25.900 align:middle line:84%
or transitioning their digestive
system as a soul preparing

00:06:25.900 --> 00:06:27.497 align:middle line:90%
for future incarnations.

00:06:27.497 --> 00:06:28.330 align:middle line:90%
SOLARIS: Absolutely.

00:06:28.330 --> 00:06:30.038 align:middle line:84%
REGINA: And when
I asked my guide

00:06:30.038 --> 00:06:32.080 align:middle line:84%
at the time I said, well,
what kind of time frame

00:06:32.080 --> 00:06:33.080 align:middle line:90%
we were looking at here?

00:06:33.080 --> 00:06:35.590 align:middle line:90%
And they said, within--

00:06:35.590 --> 00:06:38.200 align:middle line:84%
for a lot of people, just
one to two incarnations,

00:06:38.200 --> 00:06:39.770 align:middle line:90%
the transition will be complete.

00:06:39.770 --> 00:06:41.860 align:middle line:84%
And they won't be
really imbibing

00:06:41.860 --> 00:06:46.660 align:middle line:84%
much solid food, very simple
solids, not like hamburgers

00:06:46.660 --> 00:06:48.130 align:middle line:90%
and French fries anymore.

00:06:48.130 --> 00:06:49.300 align:middle line:90%
That will kind of be out.

00:06:49.300 --> 00:06:50.570 align:middle line:90%
That will be out.

00:06:50.570 --> 00:06:53.530 align:middle line:84%
So taking that
into consideration,

00:06:53.530 --> 00:06:57.550 align:middle line:84%
what have you seen as a
general rule about where we're

00:06:57.550 --> 00:07:00.160 align:middle line:90%
transitioning to diet wise?

00:07:00.160 --> 00:07:03.460 align:middle line:84%
SOLARIS: Well, a lot
of us with lineages

00:07:03.460 --> 00:07:07.270 align:middle line:84%
connected with Arcturus
or Andromeda specifically

00:07:07.270 --> 00:07:14.590 align:middle line:84%
but even some of the Syrian and
Lyra, Vega lineages as well,

00:07:14.590 --> 00:07:18.280 align:middle line:84%
we came from
civilizations where food

00:07:18.280 --> 00:07:24.920 align:middle line:84%
wasn't ingested in these higher
dimensional star systems.

00:07:24.920 --> 00:07:33.220 align:middle line:84%
Arcturians, for instance, ingest
a light like a liquid energy.

00:07:33.220 --> 00:07:37.660 align:middle line:84%
So it's like a
liquid energy force.

00:07:37.660 --> 00:07:40.370 align:middle line:90%
Andromedans don't eat very much.

00:07:40.370 --> 00:07:44.800 align:middle line:84%
So a lot of times when a soul
from Arcturus or Andromeda

00:07:44.800 --> 00:07:47.770 align:middle line:84%
incarnates on Earth and they're
dealing with all this really

00:07:47.770 --> 00:07:50.890 align:middle line:84%
dense food, they have a
lot of digestive issues.

00:07:50.890 --> 00:07:53.500 align:middle line:84%
Me, personally, I used
to suffer horribly

00:07:53.500 --> 00:08:00.860 align:middle line:84%
from IBS and acid reflux
because my body just

00:08:00.860 --> 00:08:02.510 align:middle line:90%
couldn't handle dense foods.

00:08:02.510 --> 00:08:06.405 align:middle line:84%
REGINA: So how did you
yourself transform that?

00:08:06.405 --> 00:08:08.780 align:middle line:84%
Wait, did you find there are
certain food groups you just

00:08:08.780 --> 00:08:09.580 align:middle line:90%
can't eat?

00:08:09.580 --> 00:08:11.600 align:middle line:84%
SOLARIS: Yes, I know
I can't eat dairy,

00:08:11.600 --> 00:08:15.350 align:middle line:84%
and I really
struggle with gluten.

00:08:15.350 --> 00:08:18.050 align:middle line:84%
And there's also
some other foods.

00:08:18.050 --> 00:08:21.290 align:middle line:90%
I don't do well with red meat.

00:08:21.290 --> 00:08:25.280 align:middle line:84%
I can eat fish, but red
meat, heavier meats,

00:08:25.280 --> 00:08:28.640 align:middle line:84%
I just have a really
hard time digesting.

00:08:28.640 --> 00:08:32.419 align:middle line:84%
So what I did was I
transitioned to eating

00:08:32.419 --> 00:08:37.490 align:middle line:84%
five or six small meals a
day, very low calorie meals,

00:08:37.490 --> 00:08:41.120 align:middle line:90%
very plant-based mostly.

00:08:41.120 --> 00:08:44.059 align:middle line:84%
That seems to really
work for me, especially

00:08:44.059 --> 00:08:47.840 align:middle line:84%
since I used to be
pre-diabetic, and now I

00:08:47.840 --> 00:08:50.630 align:middle line:90%
keep my blood sugar going.

00:08:50.630 --> 00:08:52.980 align:middle line:84%
But I'm not ingesting
a lot of sugar

00:08:52.980 --> 00:08:59.120 align:middle line:84%
or a lot of foods that are not
appropriate for my physicality.

00:08:59.120 --> 00:09:01.880 align:middle line:84%
I find that I struggle
a lot with sugars.

00:09:01.880 --> 00:09:04.760 align:middle line:84%
So I do keep that
out of my diet.

00:09:04.760 --> 00:09:06.440 align:middle line:84%
REGINA: And I ask you
this because there

00:09:06.440 --> 00:09:08.660 align:middle line:84%
are many people watching
this right now that will

00:09:08.660 --> 00:09:09.965 align:middle line:90%
have the exact same symptoms.

00:09:09.965 --> 00:09:10.965 align:middle line:90%
SOLARIS: Oh, absolutely.

00:09:10.965 --> 00:09:12.340 align:middle line:84%
REGINA: In fact,
myself included.

00:09:12.340 --> 00:09:13.140 align:middle line:90%
SOLARIS: Yeah.

00:09:13.140 --> 00:09:15.470 align:middle line:84%
REGINA: And so it's good
to hear how you managed it

00:09:15.470 --> 00:09:17.000 align:middle line:84%
as an individual because
we're going to go

00:09:17.000 --> 00:09:18.200 align:middle line:90%
through the different groups.

00:09:18.200 --> 00:09:19.000 align:middle line:90%
SOLARIS: Yeah.

00:09:19.000 --> 00:09:21.130 align:middle line:84%
REGINA: And each one
is a little bit unique.

00:09:21.130 --> 00:09:22.880 align:middle line:84%
And I have a question
before we get there.

00:09:22.880 --> 00:09:23.680 align:middle line:90%
SOLARIS: Yeah.

00:09:23.680 --> 00:09:25.890 align:middle line:84%
REGINA: This is off-topic
but not entirely.

00:09:25.890 --> 00:09:26.690 align:middle line:90%
SOLARIS: Right.

00:09:26.690 --> 00:09:28.732 align:middle line:84%
REGINA: Because I've known
some other Arcturians,

00:09:28.732 --> 00:09:32.840 align:middle line:84%
and they seem to have a
similar way about them.

00:09:32.840 --> 00:09:37.440 align:middle line:84%
What is your-- what is the
emotional structure from there

00:09:37.440 --> 00:09:39.030 align:middle line:90%
function as?

00:09:39.030 --> 00:09:40.620 align:middle line:90%
What's it like?

00:09:40.620 --> 00:09:43.080 align:middle line:84%
SOLARIS: As far as how
they do on Earth or just--

00:09:43.080 --> 00:09:47.970 align:middle line:84%
REGINA: How they do on
Earth with their emotions.

00:09:47.970 --> 00:09:49.470 align:middle line:84%
SOLARIS: Arcturians,
what I notice

00:09:49.470 --> 00:09:52.620 align:middle line:84%
with a lot of Arcturian star
seeds, particularly the ones

00:09:52.620 --> 00:09:56.160 align:middle line:84%
that I've worked
with, besides myself,

00:09:56.160 --> 00:09:59.970 align:middle line:84%
we struggle with a lot
of anxiety and depression

00:09:59.970 --> 00:10:03.150 align:middle line:84%
early on in life
because in our Arcturus,

00:10:03.150 --> 00:10:05.910 align:middle line:84%
we're used we're used to being
connected to a collective.

00:10:05.910 --> 00:10:10.630 align:middle line:84%
So in Arcturus, we're constantly
connected with other Arcturian

00:10:10.630 --> 00:10:11.430 align:middle line:90%
beings.

00:10:11.430 --> 00:10:15.180 align:middle line:84%
We feel a lot of love,
support, energy from--

00:10:15.180 --> 00:10:16.410 align:middle line:90%
REGINA: Learning, sharing.

00:10:16.410 --> 00:10:17.210 align:middle line:90%
SOLARIS: Yeah.

00:10:17.210 --> 00:10:19.360 align:middle line:90%
And a lot of conversation.

00:10:19.360 --> 00:10:22.980 align:middle line:84%
So when we incarnate here on
Earth, we feel very separated.

00:10:22.980 --> 00:10:24.930 align:middle line:84%
We feel like,
where's my support?

00:10:24.930 --> 00:10:25.920 align:middle line:90%
Where is my love?

00:10:25.920 --> 00:10:27.450 align:middle line:90%
Where is my family?

00:10:27.450 --> 00:10:31.980 align:middle line:84%
And so we tend to undergo
quite a bit of anxiety

00:10:31.980 --> 00:10:33.760 align:middle line:90%
early on in life.

00:10:33.760 --> 00:10:37.170 align:middle line:90%
Sometimes it can be lifelong.

00:10:37.170 --> 00:10:38.850 align:middle line:90%
I still struggle with anxiety.

00:10:38.850 --> 00:10:42.180 align:middle line:84%
I have to-- I keep
it under control,

00:10:42.180 --> 00:10:45.990 align:middle line:84%
but I do have my moments
where I do struggle with that.

00:10:45.990 --> 00:10:50.730 align:middle line:84%
And I've noticed that once
Arcturian star seeds understand

00:10:50.730 --> 00:10:54.480 align:middle line:84%
that, hey, I used to be
connected with this big family,

00:10:54.480 --> 00:10:59.070 align:middle line:84%
it seems like they're able
to manage with the anxiety

00:10:59.070 --> 00:11:01.830 align:middle line:84%
here on Earth much better
and the end the depression

00:11:01.830 --> 00:11:03.510 align:middle line:84%
where they feel
like, oh, there's

00:11:03.510 --> 00:11:04.750 align:middle line:90%
a reason why I feel this way.

00:11:04.750 --> 00:11:05.550 align:middle line:90%
REGINA: Yeah.

00:11:05.550 --> 00:11:08.430 align:middle line:84%
So they can-- yeah, they
can understand it at least.

00:11:08.430 --> 00:11:09.780 align:middle line:90%
SOLARIS: Exactly.

00:11:09.780 --> 00:11:11.250 align:middle line:90%
REGINA: And that helps.

00:11:11.250 --> 00:11:12.960 align:middle line:84%
Another thing is,
are there a lot

00:11:12.960 --> 00:11:16.507 align:middle line:84%
of Arcturians in non-physical
form who serve as guides here?

00:11:16.507 --> 00:11:17.340 align:middle line:90%
SOLARIS: Absolutely.

00:11:17.340 --> 00:11:22.290 align:middle line:84%
REGINA: And so when you're an
Acturian person or originally

00:11:22.290 --> 00:11:25.380 align:middle line:84%
a star seed who's now incarnated
as human, do you usually

00:11:25.380 --> 00:11:27.535 align:middle line:90%
have Arcturian guides?

00:11:27.535 --> 00:11:29.160 align:middle line:84%
SOLARIS: I would say
the majority of us

00:11:29.160 --> 00:11:31.377 align:middle line:90%
would have Arcturian guides.

00:11:31.377 --> 00:11:32.960 align:middle line:84%
REGINA: So can you
call on your guides

00:11:32.960 --> 00:11:35.130 align:middle line:84%
and sound needed some cuddles
and love and friendship

00:11:35.130 --> 00:11:35.730 align:middle line:90%
right now?

00:11:35.730 --> 00:11:37.410 align:middle line:84%
SOLARIS: I do that
every single day.

00:11:37.410 --> 00:11:38.850 align:middle line:90%
REGINA: OK.

00:11:38.850 --> 00:11:40.830 align:middle line:84%
SOLARIS: I'm always
hooking up with my guides.

00:11:40.830 --> 00:11:42.780 align:middle line:90%
I do that every single day.

00:11:42.780 --> 00:11:44.850 align:middle line:84%
I have running conversations
with them actually.

00:11:44.850 --> 00:11:47.353 align:middle line:84%
So it's been lovely to
reconnect with them.

00:11:47.353 --> 00:11:49.020 align:middle line:84%
REGINA: Oh, that's
wonderful because I'm

00:11:49.020 --> 00:11:50.760 align:middle line:84%
thinking of someone
specifically who goes

00:11:50.760 --> 00:11:51.900 align:middle line:90%
through the same thing you do.

00:11:51.900 --> 00:11:52.200 align:middle line:90%
SOLARIS: Yeah.

00:11:52.200 --> 00:11:53.280 align:middle line:84%
REGINA: It's like,
where are my people?

00:11:53.280 --> 00:11:54.300 align:middle line:90%
We're supposed to collaborate.

00:11:54.300 --> 00:11:56.670 align:middle line:84%
We're not supposed to be
individuals that just are out

00:11:56.670 --> 00:11:57.470 align:middle line:90%
for ourselves.

00:11:57.470 --> 00:11:58.640 align:middle line:90%
This doesn't work for me.

00:11:58.640 --> 00:11:58.926 align:middle line:90%
SOLARIS: Exactly.

00:11:58.926 --> 00:11:59.070 align:middle line:90%
Totally.

00:11:59.070 --> 00:12:00.670 align:middle line:84%
REGINA: So that's
really interesting.

00:12:00.670 --> 00:12:01.470 align:middle line:90%
SOLARIS: Yeah.

00:12:01.470 --> 00:12:03.060 align:middle line:90%
REGINA: So let's go on now.

00:12:03.060 --> 00:12:05.880 align:middle line:84%
We're going to talk about the
most common Arcturians aren't

00:12:05.880 --> 00:12:08.250 align:middle line:84%
the most common, but there
are a lot of them here.

00:12:08.250 --> 00:12:12.750 align:middle line:84%
But let's talk about the
most common star seed beings

00:12:12.750 --> 00:12:14.487 align:middle line:90%
from-- where they're from.

00:12:14.487 --> 00:12:16.320 align:middle line:84%
First of all, just kind
of label them a bit,

00:12:16.320 --> 00:12:18.330 align:middle line:84%
and then we're going to
go into each one in terms

00:12:18.330 --> 00:12:19.150 align:middle line:90%
of the challenges.

00:12:19.150 --> 00:12:22.010 align:middle line:84%
SOLARIS: Yeah that
would be awesome.

00:12:22.010 --> 00:12:24.320 align:middle line:84%
I actually did a training
on this recently,

00:12:24.320 --> 00:12:26.880 align:middle line:90%
and it was very popular.

00:12:26.880 --> 00:12:29.800 align:middle line:84%
A lot of people really gave us
some really positive feedback

00:12:29.800 --> 00:12:30.600 align:middle line:90%
with it.

00:12:30.600 --> 00:12:32.480 align:middle line:84%
So if you're interested
in that training,

00:12:32.480 --> 00:12:35.100 align:middle line:84%
feel free to connect
on my website.

00:12:35.100 --> 00:12:40.820 align:middle line:84%
But just to give an overview,
the most common star groups,

00:12:40.820 --> 00:12:43.490 align:middle line:84%
I would say there's like
six or seven, I would say,

00:12:43.490 --> 00:12:45.060 align:middle line:90%
are really common.

00:12:45.060 --> 00:12:49.340 align:middle line:84%
And then we have another
six or seven more

00:12:49.340 --> 00:12:53.780 align:middle line:84%
that are a little bit less
common, but I see quite a bit

00:12:53.780 --> 00:12:55.340 align:middle line:90%
in my Akashic readings.

00:12:55.340 --> 00:12:56.840 align:middle line:84%
REGINA: Let's go
with the first six.

00:12:56.840 --> 00:12:57.710 align:middle line:90%
SOLARIS: Top six.

00:12:57.710 --> 00:13:03.982 align:middle line:84%
Top six would be Lyra,
Vega, Sirius, Arcturus.

00:13:03.982 --> 00:13:05.690 align:middle line:84%
REGINA: Oh, so Arcturus
is high up there?

00:13:05.690 --> 00:13:08.260 align:middle line:84%
SOLARIS: Yeah, it is
pretty high up there.

00:13:08.260 --> 00:13:14.290 align:middle line:84%
Andromeda, Orion,
and Andromeda galaxy.

00:13:14.290 --> 00:13:15.370 align:middle line:90%
REGINA: Andromeda galaxy.

00:13:15.370 --> 00:13:15.860 align:middle line:90%
I'm ready.

00:13:15.860 --> 00:13:16.790 align:middle line:90%
I'm taking notes

00:13:16.790 --> 00:13:17.590 align:middle line:90%
SOLARIS: OK.

00:13:17.590 --> 00:13:21.880 align:middle line:84%
REGINA: So now what about the
other six less present ones?

00:13:21.880 --> 00:13:22.848 align:middle line:90%
SOLARIS: Less present--

00:13:22.848 --> 00:13:23.890 align:middle line:90%
REGINA: A fewer of, yeah.

00:13:23.890 --> 00:13:25.432 align:middle line:84%
SOLARIS: A fewer
would be Cassiopeia.

00:13:25.432 --> 00:13:28.850 align:middle line:90%


00:13:28.850 --> 00:13:34.710 align:middle line:84%
I would say Alpha Centauri,
Beta Centauri, Venus.

00:13:34.710 --> 00:13:35.510 align:middle line:90%
REGINA: Oh, yes.

00:13:35.510 --> 00:13:36.593 align:middle line:90%
OK, we'll talk about that.

00:13:36.593 --> 00:13:37.580 align:middle line:90%
SOLARIS: Yeah, Venus.

00:13:37.580 --> 00:13:43.050 align:middle line:84%
Polaris and Kalisieti
another one.

00:13:43.050 --> 00:13:45.540 align:middle line:90%
I occasionally get people.

00:13:45.540 --> 00:13:49.170 align:middle line:84%
And actually I get
a few on Anunnaki.

00:13:49.170 --> 00:13:51.540 align:middle line:90%
Get a few from Sirius.

00:13:51.540 --> 00:13:59.490 align:middle line:84%
I also get few occasionally some
reptilian and some Essassani

00:13:59.490 --> 00:14:01.020 align:middle line:90%
and YahYel.

00:14:01.020 --> 00:14:03.640 align:middle line:84%
So those are hybrid
races from the future.

00:14:03.640 --> 00:14:04.520 align:middle line:90%
So--

00:14:04.520 --> 00:14:05.520 align:middle line:90%
REGINA: Oh, interesting.

00:14:05.520 --> 00:14:05.910 align:middle line:90%
SOLARIS: Yeah.

00:14:05.910 --> 00:14:07.350 align:middle line:84%
REGINA: Oh, goodness, we
have a whole other show

00:14:07.350 --> 00:14:08.260 align:middle line:90%
to do after this one.

00:14:08.260 --> 00:14:09.060 align:middle line:90%
SOLARIS: Yeah.

00:14:09.060 --> 00:14:12.060 align:middle line:84%
Oh, yeah, we can go deep,
deep, deep into that one.

00:14:12.060 --> 00:14:14.857 align:middle line:84%
REGINA: Well, let's
like take the top hits.

00:14:14.857 --> 00:14:15.690 align:middle line:90%
SOLARIS: OK, let's--

00:14:15.690 --> 00:14:17.940 align:middle line:84%
REGINA: Since that's the
majority of people, at least,

00:14:17.940 --> 00:14:18.940 align:middle line:90%
that you've encountered.

00:14:18.940 --> 00:14:19.740 align:middle line:90%
SOLARIS: Yeah.

00:14:19.740 --> 00:14:21.300 align:middle line:84%
REGINA: And maybe
add the reptilians

00:14:21.300 --> 00:14:22.590 align:middle line:84%
and just because
people are intrigued.

00:14:22.590 --> 00:14:24.090 align:middle line:84%
They don't eat
they're young though.

00:14:24.090 --> 00:14:25.080 align:middle line:90%
That's not good.

00:14:25.080 --> 00:14:25.320 align:middle line:90%
SOLARIS: No.

00:14:25.320 --> 00:14:26.945 align:middle line:84%
REGINA: That's a
horrible thing to say.

00:14:26.945 --> 00:14:29.100 align:middle line:84%
But people have such a
negative connotation.

00:14:29.100 --> 00:14:31.860 align:middle line:84%
SOLARIS: Actually,
the reptilians that--

00:14:31.860 --> 00:14:34.350 align:middle line:84%
the people with
reptilian genetics

00:14:34.350 --> 00:14:36.960 align:middle line:84%
that I've worked with,
either on Anunnaki,

00:14:36.960 --> 00:14:39.450 align:middle line:84%
which is hybrid,
or full reptilian,

00:14:39.450 --> 00:14:40.620 align:middle line:90%
they've been quite lovely.

00:14:40.620 --> 00:14:41.730 align:middle line:90%
I mean, they're not--

00:14:41.730 --> 00:14:43.170 align:middle line:84%
REGINA: Yeah, they're just
the same as human beings.

00:14:43.170 --> 00:14:44.160 align:middle line:90%
SOLARIS: Yeah, exactly.

00:14:44.160 --> 00:14:45.453 align:middle line:90%
REGINA: Yeah, I get that.

00:14:45.453 --> 00:14:46.370 align:middle line:90%
I was just being mean.

00:14:46.370 --> 00:14:47.340 align:middle line:90%
SOLARIS: Yeah, I know.

00:14:47.340 --> 00:14:50.250 align:middle line:84%
REGINA: So, OK, so
let's start with Lyra.

00:14:50.250 --> 00:14:51.120 align:middle line:90%
SOLARIS: Lyra.

00:14:51.120 --> 00:14:55.020 align:middle line:84%
So I work with a
lot of clients that

00:14:55.020 --> 00:14:58.860 align:middle line:84%
have connections with either
Lyra or the specific star

00:14:58.860 --> 00:15:01.740 align:middle line:84%
system within Lyra,
which is Vega.

00:15:01.740 --> 00:15:05.370 align:middle line:84%
Vega is more of the mother
goddess consciousness

00:15:05.370 --> 00:15:08.850 align:middle line:84%
representation of the
Lyran civilization.

00:15:08.850 --> 00:15:11.370 align:middle line:84%
And the rest of the Lyran
stars are more farther

00:15:11.370 --> 00:15:13.920 align:middle line:84%
God consciousness
representations.

00:15:13.920 --> 00:15:16.870 align:middle line:84%
But pretty much I grouped
them into the same category

00:15:16.870 --> 00:15:19.170 align:middle line:84%
because they went through
similar experiences

00:15:19.170 --> 00:15:25.200 align:middle line:84%
in their past
incarnations in Lyra.

00:15:25.200 --> 00:15:29.580 align:middle line:84%
Lyrans, for the most part, and
I'm including the vegan people

00:15:29.580 --> 00:15:36.740 align:middle line:84%
with this, were lovely people
that lived in a paradise

00:15:36.740 --> 00:15:39.125 align:middle line:90%
reality for thousands of years.

00:15:39.125 --> 00:15:41.720 align:middle line:90%


00:15:41.720 --> 00:15:47.090 align:middle line:84%
There was no stress, no
adversity, no violence,

00:15:47.090 --> 00:15:48.200 align:middle line:90%
no trauma.

00:15:48.200 --> 00:15:49.802 align:middle line:90%
So then--

00:15:49.802 --> 00:15:52.010 align:middle line:84%
REGINA: It's kind of like
what humans would relate to

00:15:52.010 --> 00:15:53.130 align:middle line:90%
in Eden of sorts.

00:15:53.130 --> 00:15:53.930 align:middle line:90%
SOLARIS: Yeah.

00:15:53.930 --> 00:15:56.570 align:middle line:84%
Yeah, I think the whole
concept of Garden of Eden

00:15:56.570 --> 00:15:58.110 align:middle line:84%
maybe was represented--
was Lyran.

00:15:58.110 --> 00:15:58.910 align:middle line:90%
REGINA: Yes.

00:15:58.910 --> 00:16:05.840 align:middle line:84%
SOLARIS: So the Lyran people
lived in this beautiful reality

00:16:05.840 --> 00:16:09.950 align:middle line:84%
for thousands of years, then
all of a sudden they became

00:16:09.950 --> 00:16:12.980 align:middle line:84%
ambushed by the
Draconians from Draco.

00:16:12.980 --> 00:16:16.100 align:middle line:84%
The Draconians decided they
wanted to conquer their system.

00:16:16.100 --> 00:16:19.190 align:middle line:84%
And they went through
a horrific war

00:16:19.190 --> 00:16:22.370 align:middle line:84%
that pretty much decimated
a lot of their planets

00:16:22.370 --> 00:16:26.030 align:middle line:90%
and decimated 50 million Lyrans.

00:16:26.030 --> 00:16:29.540 align:middle line:84%
There were quite a few
survivors that ended up

00:16:29.540 --> 00:16:32.370 align:middle line:90%
seeding other star systems.

00:16:32.370 --> 00:16:36.080 align:middle line:84%
So I would say pretty much the
majority of us here on Earth,

00:16:36.080 --> 00:16:39.740 align:middle line:84%
either genetically
or spiritually,

00:16:39.740 --> 00:16:42.830 align:middle line:84%
have a connection
with Lyra and Vega.

00:16:42.830 --> 00:16:45.920 align:middle line:84%
REGINA: So what are
their unique challenges?

00:16:45.920 --> 00:16:48.710 align:middle line:84%
SOLARIS: With Lyran
and Vegan people,

00:16:48.710 --> 00:16:52.040 align:middle line:84%
I notice that when
they undergo stress

00:16:52.040 --> 00:16:54.530 align:middle line:84%
and when they get
a little bit older,

00:16:54.530 --> 00:16:57.950 align:middle line:84%
they're starting to take on more
responsibilities and life here

00:16:57.950 --> 00:17:00.890 align:middle line:84%
on Earth gets more a little
bit more challenging,

00:17:00.890 --> 00:17:06.530 align:middle line:84%
they start developing autoimmune
conditions and conditions that

00:17:06.530 --> 00:17:11.540 align:middle line:84%
are inflammation-based, so that
would be like chronic fatigue

00:17:11.540 --> 00:17:19.230 align:middle line:84%
syndrome, fibromyalgia,
Crohn's disease, lupus,

00:17:19.230 --> 00:17:22.290 align:middle line:84%
rheumatoid arthritis,
multiple sclerosis.

00:17:22.290 --> 00:17:24.920 align:middle line:84%
So all of these
conditions are usually

00:17:24.920 --> 00:17:30.080 align:middle line:84%
based from trauma
signatures that these Lyran

00:17:30.080 --> 00:17:37.820 align:middle line:84%
souls have carried in their soul
DNA for, I would say, millenia.

00:17:37.820 --> 00:17:40.670 align:middle line:84%
So initially, when they
start life here on Earth,

00:17:40.670 --> 00:17:42.950 align:middle line:84%
they're fairly healthy
because they're

00:17:42.950 --> 00:17:44.540 align:middle line:90%
the original human template.

00:17:44.540 --> 00:17:46.490 align:middle line:90%
So they're fairly healthy.

00:17:46.490 --> 00:17:49.550 align:middle line:84%
But then they undergo some
sort of traumatic experience,

00:17:49.550 --> 00:17:55.100 align:middle line:84%
or some stress, or some sort
of overwhelming situation

00:17:55.100 --> 00:17:56.690 align:middle line:84%
in their lives,
and then they start

00:17:56.690 --> 00:18:00.050 align:middle line:90%
developing these conditions.

00:18:00.050 --> 00:18:02.810 align:middle line:84%
And they're wondering, how
come nobody can help me?

00:18:02.810 --> 00:18:05.630 align:middle line:84%
I'm going to all these
doctors and none of them

00:18:05.630 --> 00:18:08.510 align:middle line:84%
can explain what's
going on with me.

00:18:08.510 --> 00:18:10.370 align:middle line:84%
If they come to see
me, I can explain

00:18:10.370 --> 00:18:11.570 align:middle line:90%
what's going on with them.

00:18:11.570 --> 00:18:13.520 align:middle line:90%
REGINA: Right.

00:18:13.520 --> 00:18:16.340 align:middle line:84%
SOLARIS: So I think
it involves-- as far

00:18:16.340 --> 00:18:19.940 align:middle line:84%
as transforming these
health conditions,

00:18:19.940 --> 00:18:22.130 align:middle line:84%
it would involve
working as much with

00:18:22.130 --> 00:18:26.684 align:middle line:84%
the psycho spiritual components
as it would with the physical.

00:18:26.684 --> 00:18:30.500 align:middle line:84%
Physically, these people
probably should really

00:18:30.500 --> 00:18:33.290 align:middle line:90%
clean up their diets.

00:18:33.290 --> 00:18:37.720 align:middle line:84%
With Lyra, Vega folks, they do
best with plant-based diets.

00:18:37.720 --> 00:18:41.240 align:middle line:84%
A lot of them seem to do
very well with vegan diets

00:18:41.240 --> 00:18:44.780 align:middle line:84%
because that mimics their
original diet from their star

00:18:44.780 --> 00:18:46.800 align:middle line:90%
system.

00:18:46.800 --> 00:18:50.540 align:middle line:84%
So the more higher
vibrational the diet can be,

00:18:50.540 --> 00:18:53.180 align:middle line:90%
I think the better they'll feel.

00:18:53.180 --> 00:18:57.590 align:middle line:84%
And really minimizing or
eliminating processed foods.

00:18:57.590 --> 00:18:59.990 align:middle line:90%
And that's a big, big thing.

00:18:59.990 --> 00:19:02.970 align:middle line:84%
REGINA: And, OK, so at this
point, thank you for that.

00:19:02.970 --> 00:19:03.980 align:middle line:90%
Let's talk about--

00:19:03.980 --> 00:19:06.183 align:middle line:84%
OK, because you say
that's the most common,

00:19:06.183 --> 00:19:07.850 align:middle line:84%
there are people
listening saying, oh, I

00:19:07.850 --> 00:19:08.660 align:middle line:90%
identify with that.

00:19:08.660 --> 00:19:09.493 align:middle line:90%
SOLARIS: Absolutely.

00:19:09.493 --> 00:19:13.850 align:middle line:84%
REGINA: So how do
people most easily

00:19:13.850 --> 00:19:16.100 align:middle line:84%
figure out what star
system they might

00:19:16.100 --> 00:19:18.840 align:middle line:84%
be from so that when
we're talking about this,

00:19:18.840 --> 00:19:19.730 align:middle line:90%
it makes more sense?

00:19:19.730 --> 00:19:20.780 align:middle line:90%
SOLARIS: Oh, absolutely.

00:19:20.780 --> 00:19:22.730 align:middle line:90%
I get that question a lot.

00:19:22.730 --> 00:19:25.130 align:middle line:84%
One of the, I think,
the most common ways

00:19:25.130 --> 00:19:27.620 align:middle line:84%
is just using your
own intuition.

00:19:27.620 --> 00:19:30.650 align:middle line:84%
So if you read
about Lyra and Vega,

00:19:30.650 --> 00:19:32.840 align:middle line:84%
or you read about cat
beings, or you really

00:19:32.840 --> 00:19:36.860 align:middle line:84%
identify with cat beings, or
you identify with avian beings,

00:19:36.860 --> 00:19:41.510 align:middle line:84%
you are probably most
likely a Lyra, Vega soul.

00:19:41.510 --> 00:19:43.520 align:middle line:84%
There was also quite
a bit of humanoid.

00:19:43.520 --> 00:19:45.770 align:middle line:84%
So Lyra went
through this process

00:19:45.770 --> 00:19:49.220 align:middle line:84%
where they started off with a
lot of cat and avian genetics,

00:19:49.220 --> 00:19:52.500 align:middle line:84%
mostly cat but
some avian as well.

00:19:52.500 --> 00:19:55.640 align:middle line:84%
And there was a lot of
elemental components to Lyra.

00:19:55.640 --> 00:19:59.750 align:middle line:84%
But then eventually as they
were trying to figure out,

00:19:59.750 --> 00:20:02.480 align:middle line:84%
how can we get beings
to stay in physicality,

00:20:02.480 --> 00:20:05.630 align:middle line:84%
they became more and more
hybridized and eventually

00:20:05.630 --> 00:20:11.810 align:middle line:84%
developed into two human races,
the blue Vega beings that

00:20:11.810 --> 00:20:16.800 align:middle line:84%
look very similar to Hindu gods
or the beings from "Avatar,"

00:20:16.800 --> 00:20:17.600 align:middle line:90%
if you want to.

00:20:17.600 --> 00:20:19.142 align:middle line:84%
REGINA: I was just
going to ask that.

00:20:19.142 --> 00:20:20.270 align:middle line:90%
SOLARIS: Yeah, "Avatar."

00:20:20.270 --> 00:20:23.540 align:middle line:84%
Or you got the white Lyrans
that looked like, I don't know,

00:20:23.540 --> 00:20:24.350 align:middle line:90%
Greek gods.

00:20:24.350 --> 00:20:27.530 align:middle line:84%
I mean, they were
very attractive people

00:20:27.530 --> 00:20:30.892 align:middle line:90%
but more Caucasian looking.

00:20:30.892 --> 00:20:32.600 align:middle line:84%
But anyway, getting
back to your question

00:20:32.600 --> 00:20:36.230 align:middle line:84%
about how to determine a
star system of origins,

00:20:36.230 --> 00:20:40.940 align:middle line:84%
I would say you're welcome
to use my website and--

00:20:40.940 --> 00:20:43.190 align:middle line:84%
REGINA: You have really good
descriptions of each one.

00:20:43.190 --> 00:20:45.260 align:middle line:84%
In fact, now that
I asked that, as we

00:20:45.260 --> 00:20:49.040 align:middle line:84%
go through these symptoms,
these what's the AS--

00:20:49.040 --> 00:20:49.910 align:middle line:90%
SOLARIS: AS, yeah.

00:20:49.910 --> 00:20:50.840 align:middle line:90%
AS, yes.

00:20:50.840 --> 00:20:52.507 align:middle line:84%
REGINA: As we go
through these symptoms,

00:20:52.507 --> 00:20:55.245 align:middle line:84%
people will say, oh, goodness,
I relate strongly to that one,

00:20:55.245 --> 00:20:57.620 align:middle line:84%
and maybe they can find a
little bit out about themselves

00:20:57.620 --> 00:20:58.170 align:middle line:90%
through this.

00:20:58.170 --> 00:21:00.440 align:middle line:84%
So let's just continue our
line of questioning then.

00:21:00.440 --> 00:21:00.830 align:middle line:90%
SOLARIS: Yes.

00:21:00.830 --> 00:21:01.130 align:middle line:90%
REGINA: OK.

00:21:01.130 --> 00:21:02.652 align:middle line:84%
Yeah, so you've
got training on it.

00:21:02.652 --> 00:21:04.235 align:middle line:84%
You've got a website
people can go to.

00:21:04.235 --> 00:21:05.960 align:middle line:90%
SOLARIS: People can go to.

00:21:05.960 --> 00:21:06.230 align:middle line:90%
REGINA: And now you can--

00:21:06.230 --> 00:21:08.230 align:middle line:84%
SOLARIS: I think it's
mainly through the traits.

00:21:08.230 --> 00:21:13.750 align:middle line:84%
Like, Lyran people
are very childlike.

00:21:13.750 --> 00:21:18.460 align:middle line:84%
They're very open hearted,
very loving people

00:21:18.460 --> 00:21:22.660 align:middle line:84%
for the most part, maybe not
the most practical people,

00:21:22.660 --> 00:21:27.790 align:middle line:84%
very drawn to plant medicine,
being around plants and nature

00:21:27.790 --> 00:21:29.830 align:middle line:90%
and animals.

00:21:29.830 --> 00:21:35.300 align:middle line:84%
And they are usually good
healers and teachers.

00:21:35.300 --> 00:21:36.100 align:middle line:90%
REGINA: OK.

00:21:36.100 --> 00:21:40.810 align:middle line:84%
SOLARIS: So we do have quite
a few wonderful, holistic

00:21:40.810 --> 00:21:44.350 align:middle line:84%
practitioners who come
from Lyra and Vega

00:21:44.350 --> 00:21:46.250 align:middle line:90%
mostly plant-medicine-oriented.

00:21:46.250 --> 00:21:47.050 align:middle line:90%
REGINA: OK.

00:21:47.050 --> 00:21:47.670 align:middle line:90%
SOLARIS: Yeah.

00:21:47.670 --> 00:21:48.010 align:middle line:90%
REGINA: OK.

00:21:48.010 --> 00:21:49.060 align:middle line:90%
SOLARIS: So--

00:21:49.060 --> 00:21:49.860 align:middle line:90%
REGINA: Good.

00:21:49.860 --> 00:21:51.640 align:middle line:84%
Well, I want to go to
Sirius because we've

00:21:51.640 --> 00:21:52.900 align:middle line:84%
got a lot to go through
before the show's over.

00:21:52.900 --> 00:21:53.710 align:middle line:90%
SOLARIS: I know, yeah.

00:21:53.710 --> 00:21:54.627 align:middle line:90%
REGINA: OK, thank you.

00:21:54.627 --> 00:21:58.090 align:middle line:84%
That's a good--
at least a good--

00:21:58.090 --> 00:21:59.680 align:middle line:84%
few touchstones
there for Lyrans.

00:21:59.680 --> 00:22:01.370 align:middle line:84%
OK, let's do the
same for Sirians.

00:22:01.370 --> 00:22:02.170 align:middle line:90%
SOLARIS: Sirius.

00:22:02.170 --> 00:22:06.430 align:middle line:10%
Sirius, OK, Sirius
was a race that

00:22:06.430 --> 00:22:10.270 align:middle line:10%
was a blend of Lyra
and Vegan refugees.

00:22:10.270 --> 00:22:15.340 align:middle line:84%
So quite a few of
their survivor ships

00:22:15.340 --> 00:22:17.150 align:middle line:90%
ended up in these systems.

00:22:17.150 --> 00:22:23.030 align:middle line:84%
And so they became the first, I
would say, mixed raced people.

00:22:23.030 --> 00:22:25.540 align:middle line:84%
And so these were
mostly humanoid people.

00:22:25.540 --> 00:22:29.380 align:middle line:84%
But Sirius also had beings
that was quite diverse.

00:22:29.380 --> 00:22:31.630 align:middle line:84%
It was a very
diverse star system.

00:22:31.630 --> 00:22:32.860 align:middle line:90%
So they had cat beings.

00:22:32.860 --> 00:22:33.940 align:middle line:90%
They had dog beings.

00:22:33.940 --> 00:22:35.950 align:middle line:90%
They had Avians.

00:22:35.950 --> 00:22:38.470 align:middle line:90%
They have amphibian beings.

00:22:38.470 --> 00:22:40.180 align:middle line:90%
They had everything.

00:22:40.180 --> 00:22:41.830 align:middle line:84%
They had some
reptilians there too.

00:22:41.830 --> 00:22:44.560 align:middle line:90%
So it was a mixed bag.

00:22:44.560 --> 00:22:47.170 align:middle line:84%
But for the purposes
of this show,

00:22:47.170 --> 00:22:52.110 align:middle line:84%
I will stick with the
more humanoid Sirians.

00:22:52.110 --> 00:22:56.730 align:middle line:84%
So humanoid Sirians
are pretty hardy.

00:22:56.730 --> 00:23:01.710 align:middle line:84%
The reason for that is
because they quite a bit

00:23:01.710 --> 00:23:05.190 align:middle line:84%
of their genetics
have been seeded

00:23:05.190 --> 00:23:07.420 align:middle line:90%
into the Earth human genome.

00:23:07.420 --> 00:23:11.520 align:middle line:84%
So the majority of us
carry, I would say,

00:23:11.520 --> 00:23:14.260 align:middle line:84%
varying percentages
of Sirian DNA.

00:23:14.260 --> 00:23:17.710 align:middle line:84%
So a lot of Sirian star
seeds, for the most part,

00:23:17.710 --> 00:23:19.710 align:middle line:90%
do quite well physically.

00:23:19.710 --> 00:23:23.640 align:middle line:84%
However, they are prone
to insulin resistance

00:23:23.640 --> 00:23:25.530 align:middle line:90%
and metabolic syndrome.

00:23:25.530 --> 00:23:27.300 align:middle line:90%
REGINA: OK.

00:23:27.300 --> 00:23:30.240 align:middle line:84%
SOLARIS: Also, some of them can
develop some heart conditions.

00:23:30.240 --> 00:23:32.400 align:middle line:84%
Sirians are very
hard working people.

00:23:32.400 --> 00:23:34.180 align:middle line:90%
They're very practical.

00:23:34.180 --> 00:23:36.270 align:middle line:90%
They are very serious.

00:23:36.270 --> 00:23:38.130 align:middle line:90%
So serious Sirians.

00:23:38.130 --> 00:23:42.060 align:middle line:84%
So it's a little bit of a
pun there but very true.

00:23:42.060 --> 00:23:44.550 align:middle line:90%
And they tend to be caretakers.

00:23:44.550 --> 00:23:49.870 align:middle line:84%
These are people that love
to be of service to others.

00:23:49.870 --> 00:23:53.500 align:middle line:84%
And so oftentimes they'll find
themselves in caretaking roles,

00:23:53.500 --> 00:23:58.920 align:middle line:84%
whether it be their
families, or their friends,

00:23:58.920 --> 00:24:01.170 align:middle line:90%
or their coworkers.

00:24:01.170 --> 00:24:06.670 align:middle line:84%
And they become very overworked
and very stressed out.

00:24:06.670 --> 00:24:07.878 align:middle line:90%
We call this sirian syndrome.

00:24:07.878 --> 00:24:09.170 align:middle line:90%
So this is the Sirian syndrome.

00:24:09.170 --> 00:24:10.210 align:middle line:90%
REGINA: SS.

00:24:10.210 --> 00:24:11.010 align:middle line:90%
SOLARIS: SS, yeah.

00:24:11.010 --> 00:24:12.030 align:middle line:90%
So now there's SS.

00:24:12.030 --> 00:24:17.160 align:middle line:84%
So Sirians will start
developing conditions

00:24:17.160 --> 00:24:19.740 align:middle line:84%
with their heart or
conditions with their weight.

00:24:19.740 --> 00:24:22.570 align:middle line:84%
So they'll start
packing on the pounds.

00:24:22.570 --> 00:24:24.090 align:middle line:84%
REGINA: And diabetes
can play into?

00:24:24.090 --> 00:24:25.380 align:middle line:90%
SOLARIS: Yeah, totally, yeah.

00:24:25.380 --> 00:24:26.880 align:middle line:84%
REGINA: With the
insulin resistance,

00:24:26.880 --> 00:24:27.750 align:middle line:90%
SOLARIS: Insulin resistance.

00:24:27.750 --> 00:24:28.550 align:middle line:90%
REGINA: Yeah.

00:24:28.550 --> 00:24:29.650 align:middle line:90%
SOLARIS: Yeah, totally.

00:24:29.650 --> 00:24:30.450 align:middle line:90%
They tend to--

00:24:30.450 --> 00:24:32.200 align:middle line:84%
REGINA: Would that be
later onset diabetes

00:24:32.200 --> 00:24:33.030 align:middle line:90%
for the most part?

00:24:33.030 --> 00:24:33.830 align:middle line:90%
SOLARIS: Yeah.

00:24:33.830 --> 00:24:37.290 align:middle line:84%
REGINA: Because of work and
lifestyle and stress and so,

00:24:37.290 --> 00:24:38.850 align:middle line:90%
yeah, late onset diabetes.

00:24:38.850 --> 00:24:41.160 align:middle line:90%
SOLARIS: Yeah, totally.

00:24:41.160 --> 00:24:45.270 align:middle line:84%
So Sirians, for the
most part, do well when

00:24:45.270 --> 00:24:49.140 align:middle line:84%
they go on more of a paleo
type of diet, or a keto,

00:24:49.140 --> 00:24:52.650 align:middle line:90%
or low carb type diet.

00:24:52.650 --> 00:24:56.400 align:middle line:84%
So as long as they're watching
their sugars and carbohydrates,

00:24:56.400 --> 00:24:59.580 align:middle line:84%
they usually recover
quite quickly.

00:24:59.580 --> 00:25:01.380 align:middle line:90%
Same with the heart conditions.

00:25:01.380 --> 00:25:03.300 align:middle line:90%
They might want to--

00:25:03.300 --> 00:25:10.080 align:middle line:84%
rather than going on some of the
statin drugs or the big pharma

00:25:10.080 --> 00:25:15.540 align:middle line:84%
drugs, they do
well when they take

00:25:15.540 --> 00:25:18.450 align:middle line:84%
supplements that relate
to reducing stress

00:25:18.450 --> 00:25:22.860 align:middle line:84%
like ashwagandha, or
rhodiola rosea, or valerian.

00:25:22.860 --> 00:25:25.980 align:middle line:90%
REGINA: Valerian, yeah.

00:25:25.980 --> 00:25:28.710 align:middle line:84%
SOLARIS: And they usually
recover much more quickly

00:25:28.710 --> 00:25:30.135 align:middle line:90%
than the Lyran and Vegan people.

00:25:30.135 --> 00:25:30.840 align:middle line:90%
REGINA: OK.

00:25:30.840 --> 00:25:32.220 align:middle line:84%
Because they're
hardier by nature.

00:25:32.220 --> 00:25:32.880 align:middle line:90%
SOLARIS: Yeah, totally.

00:25:32.880 --> 00:25:34.990 align:middle line:84%
REGINA: A little more compatible
with the genetics of Earth.

00:25:34.990 --> 00:25:35.980 align:middle line:90%
SOLARIS: Yeah, totally.

00:25:35.980 --> 00:25:36.390 align:middle line:90%
REGINA: OK.

00:25:36.390 --> 00:25:36.960 align:middle line:90%
SOLARIS: Exactly.

00:25:36.960 --> 00:25:37.290 align:middle line:90%
REGINA: Cool.

00:25:37.290 --> 00:25:39.510 align:middle line:84%
Well, let's touch just
for a minute on Arcturus

00:25:39.510 --> 00:25:40.950 align:middle line:84%
again because we already
kind of went there,

00:25:40.950 --> 00:25:42.780 align:middle line:84%
but you're talking a
lot of digestive upset.

00:25:42.780 --> 00:25:43.580 align:middle line:90%
SOLARIS: Yeah.

00:25:43.580 --> 00:25:44.820 align:middle line:90%
REGINA: So why is that?

00:25:44.820 --> 00:25:46.470 align:middle line:90%
Well, you explained it earlier.

00:25:46.470 --> 00:25:47.280 align:middle line:90%
SOLARIS: Yeah.

00:25:47.280 --> 00:25:49.350 align:middle line:84%
Because Arcturians aren't
used to eating foods.

00:25:49.350 --> 00:25:50.400 align:middle line:90%
REGINA: Yeah, yeah.

00:25:50.400 --> 00:25:51.450 align:middle line:90%
That explains it.

00:25:51.450 --> 00:25:53.700 align:middle line:84%
SOLARIS: But what happens
when a lot of Arcturian star

00:25:53.700 --> 00:25:57.630 align:middle line:84%
seeds incarnate on Earth is that
we get fascinated with food.

00:25:57.630 --> 00:25:59.432 align:middle line:90%
We want to try everything.

00:25:59.432 --> 00:26:01.140 align:middle line:84%
Yeah, we're just like,
oh my God, there's

00:26:01.140 --> 00:26:05.370 align:middle line:84%
this smorgasbord of food and
all these sensual pleasures.

00:26:05.370 --> 00:26:07.350 align:middle line:84%
And so we get a little
overboard at first.

00:26:07.350 --> 00:26:12.870 align:middle line:84%
But Arcturians probably along
with the Andromeda star seeds

00:26:12.870 --> 00:26:17.670 align:middle line:84%
probably have the roughest time
as far as physical illnesses.

00:26:17.670 --> 00:26:24.150 align:middle line:84%
Arcturians fall prey to
several cancer conditions.

00:26:24.150 --> 00:26:26.670 align:middle line:84%
We seem to struggle
with our thyroid

00:26:26.670 --> 00:26:28.510 align:middle line:90%
and our endocrine systems.

00:26:28.510 --> 00:26:32.040 align:middle line:84%
So we get some really
bizarre illnesses.

00:26:32.040 --> 00:26:35.970 align:middle line:84%
I know at one time I suffered
from hyperparathyroidism,

00:26:35.970 --> 00:26:40.770 align:middle line:84%
which is not the thyroid,
is the parathyroid.

00:26:40.770 --> 00:26:44.560 align:middle line:84%
And it affects your calcium
levels in your blood.

00:26:44.560 --> 00:26:48.180 align:middle line:84%
So I had to have a special
surgery to remove tumors

00:26:48.180 --> 00:26:49.187 align:middle line:90%
from my parathyroid.

00:26:49.187 --> 00:26:50.520 align:middle line:90%
REGINA: Oh, my mom had that too.

00:26:50.520 --> 00:26:51.320 align:middle line:90%
SOLARIS: Yeah.

00:26:51.320 --> 00:26:54.360 align:middle line:84%
And so I have a little
scar right here.

00:26:54.360 --> 00:26:59.370 align:middle line:84%
And I've had actually several
clients, Arcturian clients that

00:26:59.370 --> 00:27:01.290 align:middle line:90%
have had hyperparathyroidism.

00:27:01.290 --> 00:27:03.450 align:middle line:84%
It seems to be
something that's related

00:27:03.450 --> 00:27:05.550 align:middle line:90%
to Arcturians for some reason.

00:27:05.550 --> 00:27:07.380 align:middle line:90%
REGINA: Interesting.

00:27:07.380 --> 00:27:09.930 align:middle line:84%
SOLARIS: And we tend
to be hypothyroid.

00:27:09.930 --> 00:27:13.390 align:middle line:84%
So we struggle with
hormone balance.

00:27:13.390 --> 00:27:15.540 align:middle line:84%
So a lot of times we
struggle with skin

00:27:15.540 --> 00:27:18.520 align:middle line:84%
conditions in addition
to the stomach upset.

00:27:18.520 --> 00:27:19.320 align:middle line:90%
So--

00:27:19.320 --> 00:27:20.790 align:middle line:84%
REGINA: Wow, you guys
really get walloped.

00:27:20.790 --> 00:27:21.600 align:middle line:90%
SOLARIS: Yeah, we do.

00:27:21.600 --> 00:27:22.400 align:middle line:90%
We do.

00:27:22.400 --> 00:27:25.620 align:middle line:84%
I mean, I was a mess for the
first 50 years of my life.

00:27:25.620 --> 00:27:29.010 align:middle line:84%
I had horrible acne
as a child, actually

00:27:29.010 --> 00:27:31.080 align:middle line:90%
as a teenager and a child.

00:27:31.080 --> 00:27:33.370 align:middle line:84%
I started getting
acne at 10 years old.

00:27:33.370 --> 00:27:34.170 align:middle line:90%
REGINA: Oh, boy.

00:27:34.170 --> 00:27:36.630 align:middle line:84%
SOLARIS: Yeah, it
was pretty bad.

00:27:36.630 --> 00:27:40.440 align:middle line:84%
And then I had all the stomach
issues and the anxiety.

00:27:40.440 --> 00:27:42.850 align:middle line:84%
Yeah, we just really
have it rough.

00:27:42.850 --> 00:27:45.240 align:middle line:84%
REGINA: Parathyroid
hypothyroidism.

00:27:45.240 --> 00:27:48.060 align:middle line:90%
OK, so that's Arcturus.

00:27:48.060 --> 00:27:50.040 align:middle line:84%
What would be some
differentiating factors

00:27:50.040 --> 00:27:52.080 align:middle line:90%
if we go to Andromedans then?

00:27:52.080 --> 00:27:56.400 align:middle line:84%
SOLARIS: Andromedans also
suffer from digestive issues.

00:27:56.400 --> 00:28:00.230 align:middle line:84%
They have a lot of food
allergies, I notice.

00:28:00.230 --> 00:28:03.500 align:middle line:84%
Andromedans, there's
a lot of foods

00:28:03.500 --> 00:28:05.480 align:middle line:84%
that are not compatible
with, so they almost

00:28:05.480 --> 00:28:07.860 align:middle line:84%
have to do trial and
error, a lot of times,

00:28:07.860 --> 00:28:09.320 align:middle line:90%
which can be quite tedious.

00:28:09.320 --> 00:28:12.020 align:middle line:84%
But the other thing
with Andromedans

00:28:12.020 --> 00:28:17.500 align:middle line:84%
is that they also have
the inflammation issues

00:28:17.500 --> 00:28:21.010 align:middle line:90%
but not similar to the Lyrans.

00:28:21.010 --> 00:28:25.790 align:middle line:84%
It's more like
off-the-wall diseases.

00:28:25.790 --> 00:28:30.280 align:middle line:84%
And so in a lot of ways, they're
similar to the Arcturians

00:28:30.280 --> 00:28:33.760 align:middle line:90%
but not exactly.

00:28:33.760 --> 00:28:35.590 align:middle line:90%
Their issues are--

00:28:35.590 --> 00:28:39.710 align:middle line:84%
They can have gynecological
issues as well.

00:28:39.710 --> 00:28:45.910 align:middle line:84%
And they just seem to struggle
all around by diseases

00:28:45.910 --> 00:28:48.730 align:middle line:84%
that there's really
no explanation for.

00:28:48.730 --> 00:28:50.860 align:middle line:84%
REGINA: So these are
among the group of people

00:28:50.860 --> 00:28:53.810 align:middle line:84%
that go to doctors and they say,
it's all in your head maybe.

00:28:53.810 --> 00:28:54.610 align:middle line:90%
SOLARIS: Yeah.

00:28:54.610 --> 00:28:55.120 align:middle line:90%
Yeah, exactly.

00:28:55.120 --> 00:28:56.953 align:middle line:84%
REGINA: We can't see
there's anything there.

00:28:56.953 --> 00:28:59.020 align:middle line:84%
And that's very,
very challenging

00:28:59.020 --> 00:29:01.775 align:middle line:84%
for human beings to
go to a doctor who's

00:29:01.775 --> 00:29:04.150 align:middle line:84%
supposed to know something
about bodies and find out they

00:29:04.150 --> 00:29:06.190 align:middle line:84%
don't know anything about
how your body works.

00:29:06.190 --> 00:29:07.840 align:middle line:90%
SOLARIS: Yeah, absolutely.

00:29:07.840 --> 00:29:10.510 align:middle line:84%
Andromedans, like
Arcturian star seeds

00:29:10.510 --> 00:29:13.420 align:middle line:90%
are relatively rare groups.

00:29:13.420 --> 00:29:17.260 align:middle line:84%
So there's probably
not as much information

00:29:17.260 --> 00:29:19.700 align:middle line:84%
out there about how do they
deal with these illnesses.

00:29:19.700 --> 00:29:20.500 align:middle line:90%
REGINA: Right.

00:29:20.500 --> 00:29:21.010 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:29:21.010 --> 00:29:21.820 align:middle line:90%
SOLARIS: Yeah.

00:29:21.820 --> 00:29:22.960 align:middle line:90%
REGINA: Onto Orion.

00:29:22.960 --> 00:29:23.800 align:middle line:90%
SOLARIS: Orion.

00:29:23.800 --> 00:29:24.805 align:middle line:90%
Oh, yeah, Orion.

00:29:24.805 --> 00:29:28.930 align:middle line:84%
Orion is similar
to Sirius in that--

00:29:28.930 --> 00:29:31.900 align:middle line:84%
and they do share quite a
bit of genetics with Sirians.

00:29:31.900 --> 00:29:38.950 align:middle line:84%
But Orion is similar to
Sirius in that they basically

00:29:38.950 --> 00:29:42.450 align:middle line:90%
tend to be pretty hardy.

00:29:42.450 --> 00:29:46.650 align:middle line:84%
But what they struggle with
a lot is heart conditions.

00:29:46.650 --> 00:29:48.870 align:middle line:84%
Orion star seeds
carry a lot of anger

00:29:48.870 --> 00:29:52.050 align:middle line:84%
from past lives where they
might have been enslaved,

00:29:52.050 --> 00:29:55.680 align:middle line:84%
or might have had to work
for reptilian forces,

00:29:55.680 --> 00:29:58.230 align:middle line:84%
or they have attachments
that are associated

00:29:58.230 --> 00:30:01.260 align:middle line:84%
with these connections,
with reptilians,

00:30:01.260 --> 00:30:07.350 align:middle line:84%
and gray aliens in some
of the Orion star systems.

00:30:07.350 --> 00:30:11.460 align:middle line:84%
So they suffer a lot from
heart conditions and stroke

00:30:11.460 --> 00:30:16.230 align:middle line:84%
and other conditions that
are more, I would say,

00:30:16.230 --> 00:30:18.390 align:middle line:90%
urgent or immediate.

00:30:18.390 --> 00:30:25.500 align:middle line:84%
So for them, anger
management, emotional--

00:30:25.500 --> 00:30:26.790 align:middle line:90%
REGINA: Meditation.

00:30:26.790 --> 00:30:30.970 align:middle line:84%
SOLARIS: --yeah,
would help them a lot.

00:30:30.970 --> 00:30:34.720 align:middle line:84%
They do well with the cache
clearings and any kind

00:30:34.720 --> 00:30:38.140 align:middle line:84%
of shadow work that
helps them to transcend

00:30:38.140 --> 00:30:44.020 align:middle line:84%
a lot of these old karmic
connections with past lives

00:30:44.020 --> 00:30:47.380 align:middle line:84%
where maybe they
felt disempowered.

00:30:47.380 --> 00:30:50.800 align:middle line:84%
REGINA: So they could
definitely use like cosmic hugs.

00:30:50.800 --> 00:30:52.272 align:middle line:90%
SOLARIS: Yeah, totally.

00:30:52.272 --> 00:30:53.230 align:middle line:90%
REGINA: And human hugs.

00:30:53.230 --> 00:30:55.060 align:middle line:90%
SOLARIS: Human hugs.

00:30:55.060 --> 00:30:57.880 align:middle line:84%
They tend to do well
on meat-based diets.

00:30:57.880 --> 00:31:00.370 align:middle line:84%
But I noticed with
Orion star seeds,

00:31:00.370 --> 00:31:04.840 align:middle line:84%
as they upgrade and
ascend and transcend,

00:31:04.840 --> 00:31:08.870 align:middle line:84%
they tend to do better on the
more plant-based diets as well.

00:31:08.870 --> 00:31:10.780 align:middle line:84%
REGINA: So once they
start transforming

00:31:10.780 --> 00:31:13.262 align:middle line:84%
through the beyond the stress
and anger and so forth.

00:31:13.262 --> 00:31:14.095 align:middle line:90%
SOLARIS: Absolutely.

00:31:14.095 --> 00:31:15.160 align:middle line:84%
REGINA: Yeah,
because that's dense.

00:31:15.160 --> 00:31:16.910 align:middle line:84%
Those are very
dense frequencies.

00:31:16.910 --> 00:31:19.722 align:middle line:84%
So you would need denser
foods to be able to hold that.

00:31:19.722 --> 00:31:20.680 align:middle line:90%
SOLARIS: Yeah, totally.

00:31:20.680 --> 00:31:22.120 align:middle line:90%
Totally.

00:31:22.120 --> 00:31:25.000 align:middle line:90%
REGINA: OK, now what about--

00:31:25.000 --> 00:31:26.230 align:middle line:90%
gee, I'm not reading.

00:31:26.230 --> 00:31:27.967 align:middle line:90%
It's not Andromeda.

00:31:27.967 --> 00:31:29.050 align:middle line:90%
SOLARIS: Andromeda Galaxy?

00:31:29.050 --> 00:31:31.480 align:middle line:90%
REGINA: Yeah, the galaxy, yeah.

00:31:31.480 --> 00:31:36.610 align:middle line:84%
SOLARIS: Andromeda galaxy people
are kind of all over the place.

00:31:36.610 --> 00:31:42.760 align:middle line:84%
They're not as specific as the
Andromeda constellation groups.

00:31:42.760 --> 00:31:47.200 align:middle line:84%
But what I see with them
is a lot of anxiety,

00:31:47.200 --> 00:31:51.850 align:middle line:84%
kind of a lot of
generalized anxiety issues,

00:31:51.850 --> 00:31:58.420 align:middle line:84%
a lot of issues where maybe
they're not quite as--

00:31:58.420 --> 00:32:00.970 align:middle line:84%
it's like, again,
similar to the Arcturian

00:32:00.970 --> 00:32:04.630 align:middle line:84%
where there's a lot
of endocrine issues.

00:32:04.630 --> 00:32:08.380 align:middle line:90%
Cancer is a big one with them.

00:32:08.380 --> 00:32:11.890 align:middle line:84%
They tend to have a lot of
incarnations on Earth, which

00:32:11.890 --> 00:32:13.578 align:middle line:90%
seems kind of--

00:32:13.578 --> 00:32:14.620 align:middle line:90%
REGINA: Counterintuitive.

00:32:14.620 --> 00:32:16.540 align:middle line:84%
SOLARIS: Yeah,
counterintuitive, yeah.

00:32:16.540 --> 00:32:17.860 align:middle line:84%
REGINA: Their bodies
would be more able.

00:32:17.860 --> 00:32:18.660 align:middle line:90%
SOLARIS: Yeah.

00:32:18.660 --> 00:32:24.100 align:middle line:84%
But I think because they're
so devoted to the evolution

00:32:24.100 --> 00:32:27.530 align:middle line:84%
of the galaxy, that they
tend to take on a lot.

00:32:27.530 --> 00:32:30.340 align:middle line:84%
So what I see a lot
with Andromeda Galaxy

00:32:30.340 --> 00:32:33.640 align:middle line:84%
souls is that they're so
devoted to the mission.

00:32:33.640 --> 00:32:37.820 align:middle line:84%
They'll take on the worst
families or the worst life

00:32:37.820 --> 00:32:38.620 align:middle line:90%
lessons.

00:32:38.620 --> 00:32:43.540 align:middle line:84%
And so they're dealing with a
lot of transcendence of trauma.

00:32:43.540 --> 00:32:45.740 align:middle line:84%
REGINA: Yeah, high,
high intensity learning.

00:32:45.740 --> 00:32:46.540 align:middle line:90%
SOLARIS: Yeah.

00:32:46.540 --> 00:32:51.280 align:middle line:84%
So a lot of times when I'm
working with Andromeda Galaxy

00:32:51.280 --> 00:32:53.470 align:middle line:84%
folks, we're working
with a lot of trauma

00:32:53.470 --> 00:32:57.180 align:middle line:90%
from past Earth lives.

00:32:57.180 --> 00:33:00.090 align:middle line:90%
And they tend to be pretty--

00:33:00.090 --> 00:33:01.630 align:middle line:90%
they tend to hang in there.

00:33:01.630 --> 00:33:05.760 align:middle line:84%
I mean, a lot of
Andromeda Galaxy souls

00:33:05.760 --> 00:33:10.770 align:middle line:84%
actually do quite well
with frequency healing.

00:33:10.770 --> 00:33:15.270 align:middle line:84%
So if they go to energy healers
or if they work with, say,

00:33:15.270 --> 00:33:17.888 align:middle line:90%
theta healing or some--

00:33:17.888 --> 00:33:18.930 align:middle line:90%
REGINA: Frequency device.

00:33:18.930 --> 00:33:20.850 align:middle line:84%
SOLARIS: --devices,
yeah, they do really

00:33:20.850 --> 00:33:26.340 align:middle line:84%
well because for them
it's all about frequency.

00:33:26.340 --> 00:33:31.090 align:middle line:84%
So sound frequency healing
too would be a good one.

00:33:31.090 --> 00:33:33.600 align:middle line:84%
So maybe having
like a sound bath

00:33:33.600 --> 00:33:36.780 align:middle line:84%
or being around some
crystal bowls maybe

00:33:36.780 --> 00:33:38.380 align:middle line:84%
would really help
them out a lot.

00:33:38.380 --> 00:33:39.180 align:middle line:90%
REGINA: OK.

00:33:39.180 --> 00:33:39.930 align:middle line:90%
Thank you.

00:33:39.930 --> 00:33:40.730 align:middle line:90%
SOLARIS: Yeah.

00:33:40.730 --> 00:33:43.680 align:middle line:84%
REGINA: What I'd like to do
now is-- you touched on Venus.

00:33:43.680 --> 00:33:45.720 align:middle line:84%
I would like to get
into our solar system

00:33:45.720 --> 00:33:47.460 align:middle line:84%
because there are
also, I believe,

00:33:47.460 --> 00:33:50.520 align:middle line:84%
are quite a few people that
were formerly from Mars

00:33:50.520 --> 00:33:53.580 align:middle line:84%
and maybe even working
with technology and such

00:33:53.580 --> 00:33:54.930 align:middle line:90%
to get back there one day.

00:33:54.930 --> 00:33:55.380 align:middle line:90%
SOLARIS: Yeah, totally.

00:33:55.380 --> 00:33:56.797 align:middle line:84%
REGINA: So let's
start with Venus,

00:33:56.797 --> 00:34:01.980 align:middle line:84%
the beings from Venus who we
have chronicled in the past.

00:34:01.980 --> 00:34:04.530 align:middle line:84%
Humans have chronicled
interactions with, especially

00:34:04.530 --> 00:34:07.440 align:middle line:84%
in the '50s and '60s when
they're arriving and chatting

00:34:07.440 --> 00:34:09.989 align:middle line:84%
with people, beautiful
people chatting

00:34:09.989 --> 00:34:13.830 align:middle line:84%
with other people about what
we needed to take a look at.

00:34:13.830 --> 00:34:15.389 align:middle line:90%
SOLARIS: I do get a few--

00:34:15.389 --> 00:34:18.540 align:middle line:84%
I do work with a few clients
that have incarnations

00:34:18.540 --> 00:34:20.190 align:middle line:90%
or came from Venus.

00:34:20.190 --> 00:34:29.420 align:middle line:84%
So for the most part, they
tend to be Sirian in origin.

00:34:29.420 --> 00:34:32.600 align:middle line:84%
So I think a long,
long time ago,

00:34:32.600 --> 00:34:38.440 align:middle line:84%
there was a group called the
Hathors that seeded Venus.

00:34:38.440 --> 00:34:43.780 align:middle line:84%
So they brought in this divine
feminine energy to the Venus

00:34:43.780 --> 00:34:46.270 align:middle line:84%
planet because
they wanted to have

00:34:46.270 --> 00:34:49.929 align:middle line:84%
an anchor for divine
femininity on planet Earth--

00:34:49.929 --> 00:34:52.449 align:middle line:84%
I mean, on our
solar system, sorry.

00:34:52.449 --> 00:34:54.550 align:middle line:84%
Planet Earth was
more meant to be

00:34:54.550 --> 00:34:57.280 align:middle line:84%
like a blend of masculine
and feminine energies.

00:34:57.280 --> 00:35:00.340 align:middle line:84%
And Mars is very masculine,
Mars and Maldek, which

00:35:00.340 --> 00:35:02.440 align:middle line:90%
is I'm going to bring up also.

00:35:02.440 --> 00:35:05.110 align:middle line:84%
But Venus had an
interesting history

00:35:05.110 --> 00:35:08.060 align:middle line:84%
because their planet used
to be quite inhabitable.

00:35:08.060 --> 00:35:08.860 align:middle line:90%
REGINA: Yes.

00:35:08.860 --> 00:35:12.190 align:middle line:84%
SOLARIS: And then it
was similar to Earth.

00:35:12.190 --> 00:35:18.550 align:middle line:84%
And then I don't know if their
orbit shifted or what happened.

00:35:18.550 --> 00:35:23.080 align:middle line:84%
But there was a natural disaster
that happened with Venus too.

00:35:23.080 --> 00:35:25.987 align:middle line:84%
And I saw this in the
"Akashic records."

00:35:25.987 --> 00:35:28.070 align:middle line:84%
I don't know if it correlates
with other accounts.

00:35:28.070 --> 00:35:33.040 align:middle line:84%
But what I saw in the records
is that somehow their orbit

00:35:33.040 --> 00:35:36.550 align:middle line:84%
shifted, I think,
after things that

00:35:36.550 --> 00:35:39.310 align:middle line:84%
happened within the rest
of the solar system,

00:35:39.310 --> 00:35:42.610 align:middle line:84%
and then the planet was
no longer inhabitable.

00:35:42.610 --> 00:35:47.420 align:middle line:84%
So a lot of Annusians had to
migrate to the Proxima Centauri

00:35:47.420 --> 00:35:48.220 align:middle line:90%
system.

00:35:48.220 --> 00:35:50.530 align:middle line:84%
So that would be Alpha
and Beta Centauri.

00:35:50.530 --> 00:35:51.550 align:middle line:90%
REGINA: Interesting.

00:35:51.550 --> 00:35:55.960 align:middle line:84%
And interestingly too, as
we talk about all of this,

00:35:55.960 --> 00:35:58.930 align:middle line:84%
we're talking about
more physical dimensions

00:35:58.930 --> 00:35:59.927 align:middle line:90%
of these planets.

00:35:59.927 --> 00:36:00.760 align:middle line:90%
SOLARIS: Absolutely.

00:36:00.760 --> 00:36:02.343 align:middle line:84%
REGINA: Because each
of these planets,

00:36:02.343 --> 00:36:04.720 align:middle line:84%
including Earth, has
other dimensions that

00:36:04.720 --> 00:36:06.700 align:middle line:84%
would be less
dense less physical

00:36:06.700 --> 00:36:08.158 align:middle line:84%
but still have
whole civilizations.

00:36:08.158 --> 00:36:09.033 align:middle line:90%
SOLARIS: Oh, totally.

00:36:09.033 --> 00:36:10.600 align:middle line:84%
REGINA: So some
of the Venutians,

00:36:10.600 --> 00:36:12.490 align:middle line:84%
or Martians, or
whomever is coming

00:36:12.490 --> 00:36:16.090 align:middle line:84%
here can be coming from
another dimension of that area

00:36:16.090 --> 00:36:18.107 align:middle line:90%
and be able to phase in to here.

00:36:18.107 --> 00:36:18.940 align:middle line:90%
SOLARIS: Absolutely.

00:36:18.940 --> 00:36:21.200 align:middle line:84%
REGINA: So just
bringing that up.

00:36:21.200 --> 00:36:22.960 align:middle line:84%
So what are some
of the challenges

00:36:22.960 --> 00:36:24.970 align:middle line:90%
then for the Venutians?

00:36:24.970 --> 00:36:26.235 align:middle line:90%
Or are they more hardy?

00:36:26.235 --> 00:36:27.860 align:middle line:84%
SOLARIS: I think they
tend to be more--

00:36:27.860 --> 00:36:28.150 align:middle line:90%
[INTERPOSING VOICES]

00:36:28.150 --> 00:36:29.710 align:middle line:84%
SOLARIS: Yeah,
they're Sirian stocks,

00:36:29.710 --> 00:36:32.050 align:middle line:90%
so they tend to be quite hardy.

00:36:32.050 --> 00:36:34.930 align:middle line:84%
Maybe some of their issues,
if they do have them,

00:36:34.930 --> 00:36:38.410 align:middle line:84%
might be similar to Sirian
but to a lesser degree.

00:36:38.410 --> 00:36:41.230 align:middle line:84%
But I don't
generally-- with some

00:36:41.230 --> 00:36:43.750 align:middle line:84%
of the groups that come
from closer to Earth,

00:36:43.750 --> 00:36:49.180 align:middle line:84%
I don't see as much marked
dramatic issues with them

00:36:49.180 --> 00:36:51.850 align:middle line:84%
as I do with maybe
some folks that

00:36:51.850 --> 00:36:54.460 align:middle line:84%
come from star systems
that are more located far

00:36:54.460 --> 00:36:55.870 align:middle line:90%
away, like Andromeda.

00:36:55.870 --> 00:36:57.490 align:middle line:84%
REGINA: OK, what
about Mars then?

00:36:57.490 --> 00:37:00.250 align:middle line:84%
You touched on a moment ago
much more masculine energy.

00:37:00.250 --> 00:37:02.230 align:middle line:90%
SOLARIS: Yeah, masculine energy.

00:37:02.230 --> 00:37:06.290 align:middle line:84%
The Mars energy and
the Maldekan energy--

00:37:06.290 --> 00:37:07.930 align:middle line:84%
so I want to explain
what Maldek is.

00:37:07.930 --> 00:37:08.730 align:middle line:90%
REGINA: Yes.

00:37:08.730 --> 00:37:10.210 align:middle line:84%
SOLARIS: A Maldek
is a planet that

00:37:10.210 --> 00:37:15.220 align:middle line:84%
used to be located between
Jupiter and Mars, which is now

00:37:15.220 --> 00:37:17.800 align:middle line:84%
the asteroid belt.
So the asteroid belt

00:37:17.800 --> 00:37:22.900 align:middle line:84%
is the remnants of an ancient
planet called Maldek that--

00:37:22.900 --> 00:37:27.100 align:middle line:84%
they ended up having a Civil
War and they blew themselves up.

00:37:27.100 --> 00:37:29.110 align:middle line:84%
A big part of the
reason why a lot of us

00:37:29.110 --> 00:37:31.870 align:middle line:84%
are here right now
as star seeds is

00:37:31.870 --> 00:37:34.570 align:middle line:84%
to prevent that same
fate for planet Earth.

00:37:34.570 --> 00:37:36.830 align:middle line:84%
The Galactic councils
were a little concerned

00:37:36.830 --> 00:37:40.100 align:middle line:84%
when WW II occurred and
Hiroshima was bombed.

00:37:40.100 --> 00:37:40.900 align:middle line:90%
REGINA: Right.

00:37:40.900 --> 00:37:41.775 align:middle line:90%
SOLARIS: And I know--

00:37:41.775 --> 00:37:45.220 align:middle line:84%
REGINA: That's where
a lot of UFO activity

00:37:45.220 --> 00:37:46.810 align:middle line:84%
really ramped up
around the Earth

00:37:46.810 --> 00:37:48.670 align:middle line:90%
was after that detonation.

00:37:48.670 --> 00:37:50.450 align:middle line:90%
SOLARIS: Yeah, totally.

00:37:50.450 --> 00:37:54.340 align:middle line:84%
And Dolores Cannon
mentions this quite a bit.

00:37:54.340 --> 00:37:57.940 align:middle line:90%
So Mars and Maldek--

00:37:57.940 --> 00:38:00.670 align:middle line:90%


00:38:00.670 --> 00:38:06.430 align:middle line:84%
Mars had colonies that
contained a lot of beings

00:38:06.430 --> 00:38:11.950 align:middle line:84%
from the Orion system,
some benevolent some not

00:38:11.950 --> 00:38:12.820 align:middle line:90%
so benevolent.

00:38:12.820 --> 00:38:15.850 align:middle line:84%
So we're talking about
Zeta Reticuli individuals,

00:38:15.850 --> 00:38:17.320 align:middle line:84%
so that would be
the grey aliens.

00:38:17.320 --> 00:38:20.470 align:middle line:84%
We're talking about insectoid
along with humanoids.

00:38:20.470 --> 00:38:25.060 align:middle line:84%
Some of the tall whites
were also on board Mars.

00:38:25.060 --> 00:38:27.550 align:middle line:84%
Mars carries a lot
of masculine energy.

00:38:27.550 --> 00:38:30.100 align:middle line:84%
So their symptoms
and their issues

00:38:30.100 --> 00:38:31.790 align:middle line:84%
would be very
similar to the Orion.

00:38:31.790 --> 00:38:32.590 align:middle line:90%
So--

00:38:32.590 --> 00:38:33.040 align:middle line:90%
REGINA: Heart.

00:38:33.040 --> 00:38:34.040 align:middle line:90%
SOLARIS: --heart issues.

00:38:34.040 --> 00:38:35.320 align:middle line:90%
Yeah, a lot of heart.

00:38:35.320 --> 00:38:39.430 align:middle line:90%
I see that also with Maldekians.

00:38:39.430 --> 00:38:42.730 align:middle line:84%
Maldekian people
were people that--

00:38:42.730 --> 00:38:48.460 align:middle line:84%
I kind of jokingly call them the
Australia of the solar system

00:38:48.460 --> 00:38:52.930 align:middle line:84%
because they were people
that were kicked out

00:38:52.930 --> 00:38:56.230 align:middle line:84%
of Orion because they were--
the Orion government didn't

00:38:56.230 --> 00:38:57.620 align:middle line:90%
want to deal with them.

00:38:57.620 --> 00:38:59.920 align:middle line:84%
So they just shipped
them off to Maldek.

00:38:59.920 --> 00:39:02.500 align:middle line:84%
And so there was a lot
of infighting in Maldek.

00:39:02.500 --> 00:39:06.310 align:middle line:84%
It was not a very
pleasant planet to be on.

00:39:06.310 --> 00:39:10.260 align:middle line:84%
REGINA: So the inheritance is
broken hearts at heart, anger,

00:39:10.260 --> 00:39:11.110 align:middle line:90%
frustration.

00:39:11.110 --> 00:39:12.910 align:middle line:90%
Yeah, all of that.

00:39:12.910 --> 00:39:17.267 align:middle line:84%
SOLARIS: And maybe even
a little bit of guilt.

00:39:17.267 --> 00:39:18.100 align:middle line:90%
REGINA: Heavy heart.

00:39:18.100 --> 00:39:19.225 align:middle line:90%
SOLARIS: Heavy heart, yeah.

00:39:19.225 --> 00:39:22.480 align:middle line:84%
So they tend to have a
lot of heart conditions

00:39:22.480 --> 00:39:25.330 align:middle line:90%
the same with the Mars people.

00:39:25.330 --> 00:39:27.970 align:middle line:84%
I do get a few star seeds
that have had lifetimes

00:39:27.970 --> 00:39:32.270 align:middle line:84%
in Mars, worked on some
of those bases on Mars.

00:39:32.270 --> 00:39:36.520 align:middle line:84%
And I do get some
from Venus, too.

00:39:36.520 --> 00:39:38.960 align:middle line:84%
So I think a lot of us have
had long journeys getting here

00:39:38.960 --> 00:39:39.760 align:middle line:90%
REGINA: Oh, yeah.

00:39:39.760 --> 00:39:42.640 align:middle line:84%
I mean, there's even a step
down process that I'm aware of.

00:39:42.640 --> 00:39:45.470 align:middle line:84%
And [NON-ENGLISH]
confirmed it for me--

00:39:45.470 --> 00:39:46.270 align:middle line:90%
SOLARIS: Yeah.

00:39:46.270 --> 00:39:48.220 align:middle line:84%
REGINA: --a long time
ago about coming from--

00:39:48.220 --> 00:39:49.387 align:middle line:90%
and I'll ask that next then.

00:39:49.387 --> 00:39:50.187 align:middle line:90%
SOLARIS: Yeah.

00:39:50.187 --> 00:39:52.510 align:middle line:84%
REGINA: How about-- we'll
save some of these others

00:39:52.510 --> 00:39:54.652 align:middle line:84%
in the future species for
our next conversation.

00:39:54.652 --> 00:39:55.610 align:middle line:90%
SOLARIS: Totally, yeah.

00:39:55.610 --> 00:39:58.120 align:middle line:84%
REGINA: But then there are also
interdimensional people who

00:39:58.120 --> 00:40:01.720 align:middle line:84%
are from places that don't
have physicality from far away,

00:40:01.720 --> 00:40:07.090 align:middle line:84%
and they're here now, and
they've been through of a step

00:40:07.090 --> 00:40:10.660 align:middle line:84%
down process where you
go from galaxy to galaxy

00:40:10.660 --> 00:40:13.570 align:middle line:84%
to solar system and
densify till you actually

00:40:13.570 --> 00:40:16.370 align:middle line:84%
are able to even incarnate
in this dense field of Earth.

00:40:16.370 --> 00:40:17.170 align:middle line:90%
SOLARIS: Totally.

00:40:17.170 --> 00:40:20.770 align:middle line:84%
REGINA: So how do
interdimensionals

00:40:20.770 --> 00:40:24.610 align:middle line:84%
do here who are from
a place of no form?

00:40:24.610 --> 00:40:25.850 align:middle line:90%
SOLARIS: No form.

00:40:25.850 --> 00:40:28.870 align:middle line:84%
I do get a few folks
from Orion Nebula.

00:40:28.870 --> 00:40:33.562 align:middle line:84%
And even Andromeda Galaxy
would fall in that category.

00:40:33.562 --> 00:40:35.020 align:middle line:84%
REGINA: What about
the Crab Nebula?

00:40:35.020 --> 00:40:36.130 align:middle line:90%
SOLARIS: The Crab Nebula.

00:40:36.130 --> 00:40:39.430 align:middle line:84%
Yeah, you get some
of those folks.

00:40:39.430 --> 00:40:43.310 align:middle line:84%
Polaris is another one
of those locations.

00:40:43.310 --> 00:40:46.090 align:middle line:84%
So what happens with,
I think, with souls

00:40:46.090 --> 00:40:48.220 align:middle line:84%
is that we start off
from a very high place.

00:40:48.220 --> 00:40:50.050 align:middle line:90%
So we are all from source.

00:40:50.050 --> 00:40:57.020 align:middle line:84%
So we all are soul shards
of source as a frequency.

00:40:57.020 --> 00:41:00.970 align:middle line:84%
So then we become we
go through evolutions

00:41:00.970 --> 00:41:05.200 align:middle line:84%
like an inverted bell curve
where we go lower and lower.

00:41:05.200 --> 00:41:08.650 align:middle line:84%
With each incarnation, we
go lower and lower and lower

00:41:08.650 --> 00:41:09.820 align:middle line:90%
in dimension.

00:41:09.820 --> 00:41:11.590 align:middle line:90%
Earth is pretty much point zero.

00:41:11.590 --> 00:41:15.340 align:middle line:84%
So Earth is the lowest dimension
because I don't think any of us

00:41:15.340 --> 00:41:16.780 align:middle line:90%
are going to get to 2D.

00:41:16.780 --> 00:41:18.640 align:middle line:84%
There might be some
2D people out there.

00:41:18.640 --> 00:41:20.860 align:middle line:84%
But 2D is pretty much
a piece of paper.

00:41:20.860 --> 00:41:21.850 align:middle line:90%
REGINA: Right, right.

00:41:21.850 --> 00:41:23.500 align:middle line:84%
SOLARIS: Yeah, so
third dimension

00:41:23.500 --> 00:41:26.110 align:middle line:84%
is about as low dimensional
as you can go and still

00:41:26.110 --> 00:41:28.510 align:middle line:90%
be a sentient being.

00:41:28.510 --> 00:41:32.740 align:middle line:84%
So then we're going to
go up as we leave Earth.

00:41:32.740 --> 00:41:35.750 align:middle line:84%
So there is a
stepping off point.

00:41:35.750 --> 00:41:39.760 align:middle line:84%
So with each
consequent incarnation,

00:41:39.760 --> 00:41:41.950 align:middle line:84%
we, as souls,
because we're trying

00:41:41.950 --> 00:41:45.070 align:middle line:84%
to go through this journey
of separation from source,

00:41:45.070 --> 00:41:50.920 align:middle line:84%
we choose realities
and star systems

00:41:50.920 --> 00:41:52.630 align:middle line:84%
that maybe are
lower in dimension

00:41:52.630 --> 00:41:55.180 align:middle line:84%
than the last one we were in,
and then lower in dimension.

00:41:55.180 --> 00:41:58.450 align:middle line:84%
So I do see a fair
number of star seeds

00:41:58.450 --> 00:42:02.260 align:middle line:84%
that maybe they originated
from Andromeda galaxy,

00:42:02.260 --> 00:42:04.280 align:middle line:84%
but they had
incarnations and Lyra.

00:42:04.280 --> 00:42:05.080 align:middle line:90%
REGINA: Exactly.

00:42:05.080 --> 00:42:07.840 align:middle line:84%
SOLARIS: And then they had
incarnations in Pleiades,

00:42:07.840 --> 00:42:12.400 align:middle line:84%
and then they had incarnations
in Alpha Centauri, and then

00:42:12.400 --> 00:42:13.752 align:middle line:90%
Venus, and then Earth.

00:42:13.752 --> 00:42:16.210 align:middle line:84%
REGINA: Speaking of which, we
didn't talk about Pleiadians.

00:42:16.210 --> 00:42:16.570 align:middle line:90%
SOLARIS: Yeah.

00:42:16.570 --> 00:42:16.870 align:middle line:90%
Oh, yeah.

00:42:16.870 --> 00:42:17.920 align:middle line:90%
We didn't even mention--

00:42:17.920 --> 00:42:20.200 align:middle line:84%
REGINA: What kind of
challenges might they have?

00:42:20.200 --> 00:42:21.920 align:middle line:84%
SOLARIS: Yeah, we didn't
even bring up the Pleiadians.

00:42:21.920 --> 00:42:22.630 align:middle line:90%
And that's a--

00:42:22.630 --> 00:42:22.840 align:middle line:84%
REGINA: Yeah, well,
let's do that.

00:42:22.840 --> 00:42:24.120 align:middle line:84%
SOLARIS: Yeah,
that's a big group.

00:42:24.120 --> 00:42:26.440 align:middle line:84%
I mean, there's a lot of
Pleiadian star seeds watching

00:42:26.440 --> 00:42:27.240 align:middle line:90%
this show.

00:42:27.240 --> 00:42:31.610 align:middle line:84%
So we want to definitely
honor the Pleiadians.

00:42:31.610 --> 00:42:36.250 align:middle line:84%
So Pleiadians star seeds are
super sensitive, very empathic

00:42:36.250 --> 00:42:37.570 align:middle line:90%
people.

00:42:37.570 --> 00:42:40.090 align:middle line:84%
They come from very high
dimensional realities

00:42:40.090 --> 00:42:45.460 align:middle line:84%
that are super supportive
similar to the Arcturians.

00:42:45.460 --> 00:42:49.390 align:middle line:84%
So when Pleiadian star seeds
incarnate here on Earth,

00:42:49.390 --> 00:42:52.360 align:middle line:84%
they struggle with
a lot of diabetes,

00:42:52.360 --> 00:42:55.880 align:middle line:90%
a lot of blood sugar issues.

00:42:55.880 --> 00:42:58.900 align:middle line:84%
So I think that's why we're
seeing diabetes so prevalent

00:42:58.900 --> 00:43:05.020 align:middle line:84%
right now in our society because
life is hard here on Earth.

00:43:05.020 --> 00:43:08.050 align:middle line:84%
And a lot of the sweetness has
been taken out of our lives

00:43:08.050 --> 00:43:10.150 align:middle line:84%
with all the struggles
that we have here.

00:43:10.150 --> 00:43:13.720 align:middle line:84%
And Pleiadian star
seeds, they tend

00:43:13.720 --> 00:43:16.420 align:middle line:84%
to transmute a lot
of negative energy.

00:43:16.420 --> 00:43:19.430 align:middle line:84%
So they not only
recognize energy--

00:43:19.430 --> 00:43:22.680 align:middle line:84%
so a lot of them are
empathic-- but they transmute

00:43:22.680 --> 00:43:24.430 align:middle line:84%
the negative energies,
and then it becomes

00:43:24.430 --> 00:43:26.240 align:middle line:90%
very overwhelming for them.

00:43:26.240 --> 00:43:27.910 align:middle line:84%
A lot of them,
like the Arcturians

00:43:27.910 --> 00:43:29.360 align:middle line:90%
come down with cancer.

00:43:29.360 --> 00:43:34.180 align:middle line:84%
So they can suffer from
various cancer maladies.

00:43:34.180 --> 00:43:40.240 align:middle line:84%
They tend to do best when
they do a lot of self care.

00:43:40.240 --> 00:43:44.680 align:middle line:84%
And when they break
off, maybe codependent

00:43:44.680 --> 00:43:49.120 align:middle line:84%
relationships or connections
that are not really serving

00:43:49.120 --> 00:43:51.490 align:middle line:84%
their highest good,
a lot of them,

00:43:51.490 --> 00:43:53.650 align:middle line:84%
because they're
super empathic, tend

00:43:53.650 --> 00:43:56.800 align:middle line:84%
to fall into codependent
type of situations

00:43:56.800 --> 00:43:59.870 align:middle line:84%
either at work or through
their family relationships.

00:43:59.870 --> 00:44:02.830 align:middle line:84%
And so when they start setting
stronger boundaries, when

00:44:02.830 --> 00:44:05.920 align:middle line:84%
they start taking
care of themselves,

00:44:05.920 --> 00:44:08.200 align:middle line:90%
they tend to do very well.

00:44:08.200 --> 00:44:10.750 align:middle line:84%
With Pleiadian star
seeds as far as diet,

00:44:10.750 --> 00:44:14.500 align:middle line:84%
they tend to do better on
vegetarian and vegan diets.

00:44:14.500 --> 00:44:16.240 align:middle line:90%
That seems to be the trend.

00:44:16.240 --> 00:44:20.260 align:middle line:84%
But they can actually handle
complex carbohydrates.

00:44:20.260 --> 00:44:26.980 align:middle line:84%
They do well with sweet
potatoes or certain grains that

00:44:26.980 --> 00:44:30.550 align:middle line:84%
are hardy and help
with bringing fiber

00:44:30.550 --> 00:44:33.140 align:middle line:84%
and help balance
their blood sugar.

00:44:33.140 --> 00:44:37.690 align:middle line:10%
So, of course, if you're
a Pleiadian star seed

00:44:37.690 --> 00:44:42.490 align:middle line:10%
and you do have pre-diabetes
or diabetes, of course,

00:44:42.490 --> 00:44:46.208 align:middle line:10%
you want to take some
precautions with not overdoing

00:44:46.208 --> 00:44:47.250 align:middle line:10%
it with the carbohydrate.

00:44:47.250 --> 00:44:48.050 align:middle line:90%
REGINA: Right.

00:44:48.050 --> 00:44:51.800 align:middle line:84%
SOLARIS: But they can
manage the complex ones.

00:44:51.800 --> 00:44:52.600 align:middle line:90%
REGINA: OK.

00:44:52.600 --> 00:44:54.468 align:middle line:84%
Yeah, well, on that
we're out of time,

00:44:54.468 --> 00:44:56.260 align:middle line:84%
and there are some
things we didn't get to,

00:44:56.260 --> 00:44:57.400 align:middle line:90%
so we'll do it next time.

00:44:57.400 --> 00:44:58.200 align:middle line:90%
SOLARIS: OK.

00:44:58.200 --> 00:45:00.130 align:middle line:84%
REGINA: Well, next time
we'll talk about some

00:45:00.130 --> 00:45:02.470 align:middle line:84%
of these species from
the future because we

00:45:02.470 --> 00:45:03.860 align:middle line:90%
know time is not linear.

00:45:03.860 --> 00:45:04.660 align:middle line:90%
SOLARIS: No.

00:45:04.660 --> 00:45:07.090 align:middle line:84%
REGINA: And then we'll also
talk about the whole notion

00:45:07.090 --> 00:45:12.550 align:middle line:84%
of anti-aging and what
is being shown us now.

00:45:12.550 --> 00:45:14.860 align:middle line:84%
What is the possibility
for our future

00:45:14.860 --> 00:45:16.150 align:middle line:90%
through these different types?

00:45:16.150 --> 00:45:18.178 align:middle line:84%
SOLARIS: I can't wait to
discuss that with you.

00:45:18.178 --> 00:45:19.720 align:middle line:84%
REGINA: Yeah, that's
going to be fun.

00:45:19.720 --> 00:45:20.110 align:middle line:90%
SOLARIS: Yeah.

00:45:20.110 --> 00:45:21.685 align:middle line:84%
REGINA: Well, so
thank you so much.

00:45:21.685 --> 00:45:21.940 align:middle line:84%
SOLARIS: Thank
you for having me.

00:45:21.940 --> 00:45:24.790 align:middle line:84%
REGINA: That was a pact,
packed with data for people.

00:45:24.790 --> 00:45:26.790 align:middle line:84%
And I'm sure our audience
saw themselves in it--

00:45:26.790 --> 00:45:27.590 align:middle line:90%
SOLARIS: Yeah.

00:45:27.590 --> 00:45:28.760 align:middle line:90%
REGINA: --in one or another.

00:45:28.760 --> 00:45:29.992 align:middle line:90%
So, Debbie, thanks so much.

00:45:29.992 --> 00:45:30.950 align:middle line:90%
I look forward to next.

00:45:30.950 --> 00:45:32.325 align:middle line:84%
SOLARIS: Thank
you for having me.

00:45:32.325 --> 00:45:33.703 align:middle line:90%
It's been a real pleasure.

00:45:33.703 --> 00:45:35.620 align:middle line:84%
REGINA: Well, I hope
that was helpful for you.

00:45:35.620 --> 00:45:37.450 align:middle line:10%
Certainly fascinating
and clarifying

00:45:37.450 --> 00:45:38.860 align:middle line:10%
on a lot of different levels.

00:45:38.860 --> 00:45:40.420 align:middle line:10%
