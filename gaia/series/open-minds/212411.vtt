00:00:15.495 --> 00:00:17.620 align:middle line:10%
>> REGINA MEREDITH: The
most underutilized resource

00:00:17.620 --> 00:00:20.110 align:middle line:10%
on the planet has been
the female human brain,

00:00:20.110 --> 00:00:23.380 align:middle line:10%
according to neuroscience
researcher Kayla Osterhoff.

00:00:23.380 --> 00:00:24.970 align:middle line:10%
This is not just clickbait.

00:00:24.970 --> 00:00:25.960 align:middle line:90%
It's true.

00:00:25.960 --> 00:00:27.940 align:middle line:84%
Part of the reason
is that most studies

00:00:27.940 --> 00:00:30.280 align:middle line:84%
done in the fields of
medicine and psychology

00:00:30.280 --> 00:00:31.850 align:middle line:90%
are done on males.

00:00:31.850 --> 00:00:34.780 align:middle line:84%
So very little has been known
about the unique capabilities

00:00:34.780 --> 00:00:37.840 align:middle line:84%
of the female mind,
which you've made it

00:00:37.840 --> 00:00:39.800 align:middle line:84%
your life's work,
your passion, in fact.

00:00:39.800 --> 00:00:41.800 align:middle line:84%
You gave us a lot of food
for thought last time.

00:00:41.800 --> 00:00:45.560 align:middle line:84%
And since then, you have
since gained your PhD in--

00:00:45.560 --> 00:00:48.042 align:middle line:84%
let me say it right--
neuro-psychophysiology.

00:00:48.042 --> 00:00:49.000 align:middle line:90%
>>KAYLA OSTERHOFF: Yes.

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:50.752 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: So, congratulations.

00:00:50.752 --> 00:00:51.710 align:middle line:90%
>>OSTERHOFF: Thank you.

00:00:51.710 --> 00:00:54.620 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: There's so much being
discovered almost by the day.

00:00:54.620 --> 00:00:57.730 align:middle line:84%
And obviously, our audience
resonated very well

00:00:57.730 --> 00:00:58.670 align:middle line:90%
with this story.

00:00:58.670 --> 00:01:02.020 align:middle line:84%
And so we want to get a
carry-on of what happened before

00:01:02.020 --> 00:01:04.599 align:middle line:84%
between us when that
information has been forwarded

00:01:04.599 --> 00:01:06.587 align:middle line:90%
quite a bit since then.

00:01:06.587 --> 00:01:10.630 align:middle line:84%
So one of the things is I
want to go back and touch on,

00:01:10.630 --> 00:01:13.510 align:middle line:84%
for those who haven't seen
the previous interview,

00:01:13.510 --> 00:01:16.660 align:middle line:84%
why is it that all
these medical studies--

00:01:16.660 --> 00:01:19.570 align:middle line:84%
it's like, tell us the
percentage of studies, too--

00:01:19.570 --> 00:01:20.680 align:middle line:90%
are all done on men?

00:01:20.680 --> 00:01:24.760 align:middle line:84%
We always think, oh, no, these
studies are male and female.

00:01:24.760 --> 00:01:26.330 align:middle line:90%
We just make that assumption.

00:01:26.330 --> 00:01:27.890 align:middle line:90%
But that's not true.

00:01:27.890 --> 00:01:30.850 align:middle line:84%
Tell us the types of studies,
the percentage of studies

00:01:30.850 --> 00:01:32.420 align:middle line:84%
that are mostly
male, and so forth

00:01:32.420 --> 00:01:35.210 align:middle line:90%
so we see the problem here.

00:01:35.210 --> 00:01:36.850 align:middle line:84%
>>OSTERHOFF: Yeah,
so this problem

00:01:36.850 --> 00:01:39.520 align:middle line:84%
dates back to, really,
the beginning of time,

00:01:39.520 --> 00:01:43.060 align:middle line:84%
or the beginning of scientific
inquiry, whenever that started.

00:01:43.060 --> 00:01:45.460 align:middle line:10%
And there were two
main reasons that women

00:01:45.460 --> 00:01:48.890 align:middle line:10%
were not studied or not included
in the scientific inquiry.

00:01:48.890 --> 00:01:52.660 align:middle line:10%
And that's because of, one,
women make risky research

00:01:52.660 --> 00:01:56.050 align:middle line:10%
subjects, because they can
potentially become pregnant

00:01:56.050 --> 00:01:57.910 align:middle line:10%
at any time, right?

00:01:57.910 --> 00:01:59.140 align:middle line:10%
So that's reason one.

00:01:59.140 --> 00:02:01.930 align:middle line:10%
And reason number two
is more frustrating

00:02:01.930 --> 00:02:04.120 align:middle line:10%
and really the reason
that's lingering

00:02:04.120 --> 00:02:06.880 align:middle line:10%
and the reason why women are
not included in studies today.

00:02:06.880 --> 00:02:10.210 align:middle line:84%
And that is because of
our biological complexity

00:02:10.210 --> 00:02:12.890 align:middle line:84%
in comparison to our
male counterparts.

00:02:12.890 --> 00:02:15.680 align:middle line:84%
What I mean by that
is there are more

00:02:15.680 --> 00:02:17.930 align:middle line:84%
moving parts in
the female biology.

00:02:17.930 --> 00:02:22.370 align:middle line:84%
And women's biology is
driven by the ovarian hormone

00:02:22.370 --> 00:02:25.340 align:middle line:84%
cycle, which is very different
than the male biology, which

00:02:25.340 --> 00:02:27.170 align:middle line:90%
is driven by the adrenals.

00:02:27.170 --> 00:02:29.180 align:middle line:84%
And so what all
that boils down to

00:02:29.180 --> 00:02:32.720 align:middle line:84%
is that the female biology
and physiology is constantly

00:02:32.720 --> 00:02:36.620 align:middle line:84%
changing, little by little each
day, and ebbing and flowing

00:02:36.620 --> 00:02:40.680 align:middle line:84%
through four different
significant phases each month.

00:02:40.680 --> 00:02:43.250 align:middle line:84%
And this is why I say
women are actually

00:02:43.250 --> 00:02:45.380 align:middle line:84%
four different
women every month,

00:02:45.380 --> 00:02:47.172 align:middle line:90%
physiologically speaking.

00:02:47.172 --> 00:02:49.130 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Well, we have
four different seasons.

00:02:49.130 --> 00:02:51.150 align:middle line:84%
The Earth herself
has her seasons--

00:02:51.150 --> 00:02:52.400 align:middle line:90%
>>OSTERHOFF: Absolutely, yeah.

00:02:52.400 --> 00:02:54.233 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: --that reflect
these exact seasons

00:02:54.233 --> 00:02:57.465 align:middle line:84%
that you talk about in
terms of our neurobiology.

00:02:57.465 --> 00:02:58.340 align:middle line:90%
>>OSTERHOFF: Exactly.

00:02:58.340 --> 00:03:01.520 align:middle line:84%
And so because of this ebb and
flow and this constant change

00:03:01.520 --> 00:03:05.450 align:middle line:84%
in our physiology, it makes
us very difficult research

00:03:05.450 --> 00:03:06.290 align:middle line:90%
subjects.

00:03:06.290 --> 00:03:10.160 align:middle line:84%
And in fact, in 1977,
the FDA formally

00:03:10.160 --> 00:03:12.680 align:middle line:84%
banned all women of
childbearing potential

00:03:12.680 --> 00:03:14.720 align:middle line:90%
from all clinical research.

00:03:14.720 --> 00:03:18.800 align:middle line:84%
And that ban remained
in effect until 1993,

00:03:18.800 --> 00:03:20.700 align:middle line:90%
if you can even fathom that.

00:03:20.700 --> 00:03:20.840 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Oh, my god.

00:03:20.840 --> 00:03:22.465 align:middle line:84%
And this is for every
kind of product--

00:03:22.465 --> 00:03:24.750 align:middle line:84%
psychological studies,
social studies, everything?

00:03:24.750 --> 00:03:25.550 align:middle line:90%
>>OSTERHOFF: Yes.

00:03:25.550 --> 00:03:26.925 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: We've
been blocked out.

00:03:26.925 --> 00:03:28.430 align:middle line:90%
We're not even accounted for.

00:03:28.430 --> 00:03:32.690 align:middle line:84%
But as you say, the men
with their very regular type

00:03:32.690 --> 00:03:36.050 align:middle line:84%
of testosterone production
and 24-hour cycles,

00:03:36.050 --> 00:03:37.450 align:middle line:90%
it's low hanging fruit.

00:03:37.450 --> 00:03:38.450 align:middle line:90%
>>OSTERHOFF: Absolutely.

00:03:38.450 --> 00:03:42.260 align:middle line:84%
So what's happening is in
our modern, fast-paced,

00:03:42.260 --> 00:03:45.230 align:middle line:84%
evidence-based society,
we all want what?

00:03:45.230 --> 00:03:47.280 align:middle line:90%
Fast, cheap data.

00:03:47.280 --> 00:03:48.080 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Exactly.

00:03:48.080 --> 00:03:51.110 align:middle line:84%
>>OSTERHOFF: The only way to get
it is to study male subjects.

00:03:51.110 --> 00:03:54.200 align:middle line:84%
And that's including
humans and animals.

00:03:54.200 --> 00:03:55.670 align:middle line:84%
Even in our animal
studies, we're

00:03:55.670 --> 00:04:00.540 align:middle line:84%
using male subjects because they
are more biologically simple.

00:04:00.540 --> 00:04:02.450 align:middle line:84%
And what this really
boils down to is

00:04:02.450 --> 00:04:04.940 align:middle line:84%
it is cheaper to
study them because you

00:04:04.940 --> 00:04:08.900 align:middle line:84%
can take data collection
from several months, which

00:04:08.900 --> 00:04:12.980 align:middle line:84%
is the requirement to study
in women, down to a few days

00:04:12.980 --> 00:04:14.130 align:middle line:90%
with men.

00:04:14.130 --> 00:04:16.550 align:middle line:84%
And you can also--
you don't have

00:04:16.550 --> 00:04:19.519 align:middle line:84%
to control for so many
factors because they're

00:04:19.519 --> 00:04:21.200 align:middle line:90%
biologically consistent, right?

00:04:21.200 --> 00:04:23.990 align:middle line:84%
So they're the same
subject every day.

00:04:23.990 --> 00:04:25.980 align:middle line:90%
Women are a different subject.

00:04:25.980 --> 00:04:26.780 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:04:26.780 --> 00:04:29.430 align:middle line:84%
No, I mean from a practical
point of view, it makes sense.

00:04:29.430 --> 00:04:30.230 align:middle line:90%
>>OSTERHOFF: Yes.

00:04:30.230 --> 00:04:32.180 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: But it's
basically junk data.

00:04:32.180 --> 00:04:34.360 align:middle line:84%
It doesn't apply to
half of the population.

00:04:34.360 --> 00:04:35.670 align:middle line:90%
>>OSTERHOFF: Absolutely.

00:04:35.670 --> 00:04:36.470 align:middle line:90%
Absolutely.

00:04:36.470 --> 00:04:40.580 align:middle line:84%
So because of that gap
in our information,

00:04:40.580 --> 00:04:42.770 align:middle line:84%
that scientific gap
in our information,

00:04:42.770 --> 00:04:45.320 align:middle line:90%
we don't understand women.

00:04:45.320 --> 00:04:48.410 align:middle line:84%
And the amount of data that we
have on women and their bodies

00:04:48.410 --> 00:04:51.380 align:middle line:84%
and how they really operate
and what they need in order

00:04:51.380 --> 00:04:54.800 align:middle line:84%
to thrive is minuscule
in comparison to the data

00:04:54.800 --> 00:04:58.010 align:middle line:84%
that we have on male
bodies and male biology.

00:04:58.010 --> 00:04:59.990 align:middle line:84%
And what we've
done is we've taken

00:04:59.990 --> 00:05:03.900 align:middle line:84%
that template of our science,
all the data that we have,

00:05:03.900 --> 00:05:08.040 align:middle line:84%
which is 99.9% of it-- and
that's how significant it is.

00:05:08.040 --> 00:05:11.870 align:middle line:84%
And then we have our 1% of
data that is female-centric,

00:05:11.870 --> 00:05:13.440 align:middle line:90%
or at least includes women.

00:05:13.440 --> 00:05:14.240 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Geez.

00:05:14.240 --> 00:05:18.050 align:middle line:84%
>>OSTERHOFF: And we are
creating our societal structures

00:05:18.050 --> 00:05:20.960 align:middle line:84%
based on the data that we have,
which is very male-centric.

00:05:20.960 --> 00:05:23.085 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Well, I suppose
it's no surprise for most

00:05:23.085 --> 00:05:24.980 align:middle line:84%
of our viewers that
society, institutions,

00:05:24.980 --> 00:05:26.930 align:middle line:84%
and so forth, the
architecture of these

00:05:26.930 --> 00:05:28.430 align:middle line:84%
have been set up
for the male mind.

00:05:28.430 --> 00:05:28.565 align:middle line:90%
Period.

00:05:28.565 --> 00:05:29.450 align:middle line:90%
>>OSTERHOFF: Yes.

00:05:29.450 --> 00:05:32.450 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And the male emotional
model and mental model.

00:05:32.450 --> 00:05:33.720 align:middle line:90%
That's not working anymore.

00:05:33.720 --> 00:05:36.500 align:middle line:84%
They're all-- I mean,
there isn't an institution

00:05:36.500 --> 00:05:41.350 align:middle line:84%
that isn't really crumbling
to one degree or another,

00:05:41.350 --> 00:05:42.433 align:middle line:90%
in need of transformation.

00:05:42.433 --> 00:05:43.200 align:middle line:90%
>>OSTERHOFF: Absolutely.

00:05:43.200 --> 00:05:45.440 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So this seems to
me to be a key component.

00:05:45.440 --> 00:05:48.620 align:middle line:84%
Men and women have to be
able to stand side by side

00:05:48.620 --> 00:05:51.950 align:middle line:84%
and work in a
complex way together,

00:05:51.950 --> 00:05:56.160 align:middle line:84%
whether it's in education
or medicine or politics,

00:05:56.160 --> 00:05:58.100 align:middle line:90%
social structures, military.

00:05:58.100 --> 00:05:59.220 align:middle line:90%
Even in the military.

00:05:59.220 --> 00:06:00.020 align:middle line:90%
>>OSTERHOFF: Yes.

00:06:00.020 --> 00:06:01.200 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: So let's talk--

00:06:01.200 --> 00:06:03.658 align:middle line:84%
I mean, we talked about this
a little bit in our last show,

00:06:03.658 --> 00:06:06.960 align:middle line:84%
about how the female brain
would fit into the military,

00:06:06.960 --> 00:06:07.760 align:middle line:90%
because--

00:06:07.760 --> 00:06:10.170 align:middle line:84%
and we'll get into the
rest of this in a moment.

00:06:10.170 --> 00:06:15.640 align:middle line:84%
But it was so fun, that the male
brain is not particularly wired

00:06:15.640 --> 00:06:17.140 align:middle line:90%
for consequence.

00:06:17.140 --> 00:06:21.140 align:middle line:84%
But it is wired very
well for direct action.

00:06:21.140 --> 00:06:23.020 align:middle line:84%
So let's talk about
what this means

00:06:23.020 --> 00:06:28.000 align:middle line:84%
when you have male leaders in
the military and in politics

00:06:28.000 --> 00:06:30.710 align:middle line:84%
without the modulation
of the female mind.

00:06:30.710 --> 00:06:31.510 align:middle line:90%
>>OSTERHOFF: Yeah.

00:06:31.510 --> 00:06:35.590 align:middle line:84%
So masculine leadership,
male leadership,

00:06:35.590 --> 00:06:38.200 align:middle line:84%
and feminine leadership,
or female leadership,

00:06:38.200 --> 00:06:41.440 align:middle line:84%
are two very different
balls of wax, right?

00:06:41.440 --> 00:06:44.860 align:middle line:84%
But in our society, we
only have representation

00:06:44.860 --> 00:06:47.170 align:middle line:90%
of male leadership.

00:06:47.170 --> 00:06:50.000 align:middle line:84%
Even our female leaders
are leading in a very

00:06:50.000 --> 00:06:50.800 align:middle line:90%
male-centric--

00:06:50.800 --> 00:06:52.930 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Yes, they're
adopting male patterns.

00:06:52.930 --> 00:06:53.730 align:middle line:90%
>>OSTERHOFF: Yes.

00:06:53.730 --> 00:06:57.170 align:middle line:84%
And that's why we barely
see many female leaders.

00:06:57.170 --> 00:06:59.440 align:middle line:84%
And it's also why we see
women leaders burning out.

00:06:59.440 --> 00:07:01.065 align:middle line:84%
And we can talk about
that in a minute.

00:07:01.065 --> 00:07:05.020 align:middle line:84%
But so what we have is
this male-centric template

00:07:05.020 --> 00:07:07.450 align:middle line:84%
of leadership, which
works really well

00:07:07.450 --> 00:07:09.010 align:middle line:90%
for the male neurology.

00:07:09.010 --> 00:07:13.040 align:middle line:84%
It is actually perfectly aligned
with the male neurology, which

00:07:13.040 --> 00:07:15.080 align:middle line:90%
is wired for productivity.

00:07:15.080 --> 00:07:16.980 align:middle line:90%
It's very systematic.

00:07:16.980 --> 00:07:18.020 align:middle line:90%
It's linear.

00:07:18.020 --> 00:07:20.120 align:middle line:90%
And it's about objects in space.

00:07:20.120 --> 00:07:23.950 align:middle line:84%
It's about physical things
that you can see and tangible

00:07:23.950 --> 00:07:24.750 align:middle line:90%
results.

00:07:24.750 --> 00:07:26.208 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And
actions you can take.

00:07:26.208 --> 00:07:27.950 align:middle line:90%
>>OSTERHOFF: Yes, exactly.

00:07:27.950 --> 00:07:31.110 align:middle line:84%
Now the female neurology
is very different.

00:07:31.110 --> 00:07:32.900 align:middle line:84%
It's wired completely
differently.

00:07:32.900 --> 00:07:35.610 align:middle line:84%
And female leadership
is very different.

00:07:35.610 --> 00:07:39.770 align:middle line:84%
It's not about what you can
see and touch and smell.

00:07:39.770 --> 00:07:42.720 align:middle line:90%
It's about what you can't see.

00:07:42.720 --> 00:07:46.520 align:middle line:84%
It's about what you can
sense, what you can feel.

00:07:46.520 --> 00:07:47.420 align:middle line:90%
So--

00:07:47.420 --> 00:07:49.340 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And consequence
is a part of it.

00:07:49.340 --> 00:07:50.340 align:middle line:90%
>>OSTERHOFF: Absolutely.

00:07:50.340 --> 00:07:52.520 align:middle line:84%
Now the consequence
piece really goes down

00:07:52.520 --> 00:07:54.890 align:middle line:84%
to a psychological
predisposition

00:07:54.890 --> 00:07:56.520 align:middle line:90%
that men and women have.

00:07:56.520 --> 00:07:58.790 align:middle line:84%
So going back to the
beginning of time,

00:07:58.790 --> 00:08:02.600 align:middle line:84%
men have taken on the role
of provider for the family,

00:08:02.600 --> 00:08:04.910 align:middle line:90%
for the community, whatever.

00:08:04.910 --> 00:08:08.870 align:middle line:84%
And so in this role,
it is really important

00:08:08.870 --> 00:08:12.050 align:middle line:84%
to be focused on
self-achievement.

00:08:12.050 --> 00:08:15.470 align:middle line:84%
It is really important
to be focused on action

00:08:15.470 --> 00:08:18.680 align:middle line:84%
and what you can do because
your family or your tribe

00:08:18.680 --> 00:08:23.240 align:middle line:84%
or your community is relying
on you to be successful, meet

00:08:23.240 --> 00:08:25.700 align:middle line:84%
your goals, and come back
and bring what you produce.

00:08:25.700 --> 00:08:29.520 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So to be clearheaded
and confident in your actions.

00:08:29.520 --> 00:08:30.320 align:middle line:90%
>>OSTERHOFF: Yes.

00:08:30.320 --> 00:08:32.870 align:middle line:84%
And it's super important
to have that in society.

00:08:32.870 --> 00:08:36.200 align:middle line:84%
And we have it on a
global scale, right?

00:08:36.200 --> 00:08:40.940 align:middle line:84%
Now we've become a little too
focused just on productivity.

00:08:40.940 --> 00:08:43.640 align:middle line:84%
And that's where we've lost
the other side of the coin

00:08:43.640 --> 00:08:45.440 align:middle line:84%
that we really need
that is starting

00:08:45.440 --> 00:08:48.440 align:middle line:84%
to make its appearance now
through feminine leadership.

00:08:48.440 --> 00:08:51.680 align:middle line:84%
Now that is that women,
since the beginning of time,

00:08:51.680 --> 00:08:54.380 align:middle line:84%
have taken on more of a
caretaker role in society.

00:08:54.380 --> 00:08:55.970 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Preservation of life.

00:08:55.970 --> 00:08:57.350 align:middle line:90%
>>OSTERHOFF: Right, exactly.

00:08:57.350 --> 00:08:58.980 align:middle line:90%
So it's about connection.

00:08:58.980 --> 00:09:01.130 align:middle line:84%
It's about consideration
of the collective.

00:09:01.130 --> 00:09:04.430 align:middle line:84%
And it's about, what is
the collective impact

00:09:04.430 --> 00:09:06.830 align:middle line:90%
of my actions?

00:09:06.830 --> 00:09:12.020 align:middle line:84%
Versus the male psychology,
which is not necessarily

00:09:12.020 --> 00:09:13.500 align:middle line:90%
so concerned about that.

00:09:13.500 --> 00:09:15.710 align:middle line:84%
It's about, what
will be the impact

00:09:15.710 --> 00:09:20.570 align:middle line:90%
on my success of these actions?

00:09:20.570 --> 00:09:23.330 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So let's go ahead then
and dive in looking technically

00:09:23.330 --> 00:09:25.160 align:middle line:90%
at the differences about--

00:09:25.160 --> 00:09:26.150 align:middle line:90%
here I have some.

00:09:26.150 --> 00:09:30.290 align:middle line:84%
The denser neural network in the
prefrontal cortex of the brain.

00:09:30.290 --> 00:09:32.700 align:middle line:84%
Women have a denser
neural network.

00:09:32.700 --> 00:09:35.290 align:middle line:84%
Let's talk about the
implications of that first.

00:09:35.290 --> 00:09:36.290 align:middle line:90%
>>OSTERHOFF: Absolutely.

00:09:36.290 --> 00:09:42.380 align:middle line:84%
So generally, the male
brain is a larger organ.

00:09:42.380 --> 00:09:44.270 align:middle line:84%
And the female brain
is a smaller organ.

00:09:44.270 --> 00:09:48.260 align:middle line:84%
But the female brain actually
has denser neural networks

00:09:48.260 --> 00:09:51.110 align:middle line:84%
in specific areas
that are related

00:09:51.110 --> 00:09:53.600 align:middle line:84%
to these different
female-centric cognitive

00:09:53.600 --> 00:09:54.530 align:middle line:90%
capacities.

00:09:54.530 --> 00:09:57.620 align:middle line:84%
The prefrontal cortex is
one area, the hippocampus,

00:09:57.620 --> 00:09:58.820 align:middle line:90%
and the insula.

00:09:58.820 --> 00:10:03.080 align:middle line:84%
So all three of these
areas, also interestingly,

00:10:03.080 --> 00:10:07.093 align:middle line:84%
have high densities of receptors
for estrogen and progesterone.

00:10:07.093 --> 00:10:09.260 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: OK, so let's talk
about what each of those

00:10:09.260 --> 00:10:10.110 align:middle line:90%
are tasked with.

00:10:10.110 --> 00:10:10.910 align:middle line:90%
>>OSTERHOFF: Yes.

00:10:10.910 --> 00:10:17.850 align:middle line:84%
Yes, so the prefrontal cortex is
kind of your lens of the world.

00:10:17.850 --> 00:10:21.260 align:middle line:84%
It's hard to generalize each
area because it's not really

00:10:21.260 --> 00:10:22.160 align:middle line:90%
how the brain works.

00:10:22.160 --> 00:10:25.287 align:middle line:84%
I know it's sensationalized as,
this area does this and this.

00:10:25.287 --> 00:10:26.370 align:middle line:90%
It's not really like that.

00:10:26.370 --> 00:10:28.880 align:middle line:84%
But in general, the
prefrontal cortex

00:10:28.880 --> 00:10:32.600 align:middle line:90%
is about your lens of the world.

00:10:32.600 --> 00:10:35.030 align:middle line:84%
And it's kind of
how you see things.

00:10:35.030 --> 00:10:37.580 align:middle line:84%
But it's also how
you see yourself.

00:10:37.580 --> 00:10:43.280 align:middle line:84%
It's also responsible for
discernment, decision-making,

00:10:43.280 --> 00:10:46.040 align:middle line:90%
and these executive functions.

00:10:46.040 --> 00:10:47.700 align:middle line:90%
That's the prefrontal cortex.

00:10:47.700 --> 00:10:52.100 align:middle line:84%
The hippocampus is
involved in memory.

00:10:52.100 --> 00:10:54.950 align:middle line:84%
That's kind of the
biggest area, is memory.

00:10:54.950 --> 00:10:57.860 align:middle line:84%
And specifically,
episodic memory

00:10:57.860 --> 00:11:00.920 align:middle line:84%
is more strong in
the female brain

00:11:00.920 --> 00:11:03.930 align:middle line:84%
than in the male brain, which
is more about working memory.

00:11:03.930 --> 00:11:05.930 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Yeah, we'll get
into that in a moment.

00:11:05.930 --> 00:11:07.880 align:middle line:84%
Talk about the insula,
and then let's get back

00:11:07.880 --> 00:11:09.020 align:middle line:90%
to that working memory thing.

00:11:09.020 --> 00:11:09.820 align:middle line:90%
>>OSTERHOFF: Yes.

00:11:09.820 --> 00:11:13.110 align:middle line:84%
So the insula is all
about emotional regulation

00:11:13.110 --> 00:11:15.060 align:middle line:90%
and emotional intelligence.

00:11:15.060 --> 00:11:18.570 align:middle line:84%
It's also about understanding
the emotional undercurrents

00:11:18.570 --> 00:11:19.810 align:middle line:90%
of a situation.

00:11:19.810 --> 00:11:21.060 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Like reading a room.

00:11:21.060 --> 00:11:22.000 align:middle line:90%
>>OSTERHOFF: Exactly.

00:11:22.000 --> 00:11:25.620 align:middle line:84%
Now really interestingly,
too, about the female brain,

00:11:25.620 --> 00:11:29.155 align:middle line:84%
is it has a larger
mirror neuron system.

00:11:29.155 --> 00:11:30.280 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: What's that mean?

00:11:30.280 --> 00:11:32.160 align:middle line:84%
>>OSTERHOFF: So a
mirror neuron system

00:11:32.160 --> 00:11:38.040 align:middle line:84%
is taking in nonverbal
cues to understand

00:11:38.040 --> 00:11:42.190 align:middle line:84%
the emotional undercurrents
of situations.

00:11:42.190 --> 00:11:47.040 align:middle line:84%
So in the female brain, there
is this larger mirror neuron

00:11:47.040 --> 00:11:47.940 align:middle line:90%
system.

00:11:47.940 --> 00:11:51.270 align:middle line:84%
And it's attributed
to one of the factors

00:11:51.270 --> 00:11:57.360 align:middle line:84%
in intuition or female
intuition, which is literally

00:11:57.360 --> 00:12:00.120 align:middle line:84%
a real thing that,
now, we can measure

00:12:00.120 --> 00:12:02.140 align:middle line:90%
through scientific inquiry.

00:12:02.140 --> 00:12:05.820 align:middle line:84%
So this mirror neuron
system allows--

00:12:05.820 --> 00:12:08.070 align:middle line:84%
this larger, stronger
mirror neuron system

00:12:08.070 --> 00:12:11.460 align:middle line:84%
in the female brain
allows women to take

00:12:11.460 --> 00:12:17.230 align:middle line:84%
in nonverbal information,
to understand not only what

00:12:17.230 --> 00:12:20.650 align:middle line:84%
the situation might require
that is not being said,

00:12:20.650 --> 00:12:24.040 align:middle line:84%
but to also understand what
somebody else may need,

00:12:24.040 --> 00:12:28.010 align:middle line:84%
what the community may need, and
to establish stronger rapport.

00:12:28.010 --> 00:12:28.810 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:12:28.810 --> 00:12:30.310 align:middle line:90%
OK, so now we take all this.

00:12:30.310 --> 00:12:33.130 align:middle line:84%
We go back to the war room--
until war becomes extinct.

00:12:33.130 --> 00:12:34.310 align:middle line:90%
It's still here.

00:12:34.310 --> 00:12:36.460 align:middle line:84%
And so we go back to
the military as a model

00:12:36.460 --> 00:12:37.810 align:middle line:90%
just because it's so extreme.

00:12:37.810 --> 00:12:40.750 align:middle line:84%
So the ideal, it
seems to me, would

00:12:40.750 --> 00:12:44.410 align:middle line:84%
be you would want your
supreme commander to probably

00:12:44.410 --> 00:12:47.890 align:middle line:84%
be female, as it's taking
in all of this subtle data

00:12:47.890 --> 00:12:52.700 align:middle line:84%
and preservation of the species
is innately woven into that.

00:12:52.700 --> 00:12:56.380 align:middle line:84%
But then you would want to
have the right-hand man,

00:12:56.380 --> 00:12:58.950 align:middle line:84%
the strategist, be
male, it sounds like.

00:12:58.950 --> 00:12:59.950 align:middle line:90%
>>OSTERHOFF: Absolutely.

00:12:59.950 --> 00:13:00.750 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

00:13:00.750 --> 00:13:03.460 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And then when
you go into the execution

00:13:03.460 --> 00:13:04.600 align:middle line:90%
in the field--

00:13:04.600 --> 00:13:08.060 align:middle line:84%
I mean, it really
helps, I think,

00:13:08.060 --> 00:13:10.840 align:middle line:84%
to not have consequence in mind
when you're a young soldier.

00:13:10.840 --> 00:13:15.580 align:middle line:84%
And it's very unfortunate
because these young men sign up

00:13:15.580 --> 00:13:18.330 align:middle line:84%
for the excitement of
camaraderie and battle

00:13:18.330 --> 00:13:19.130 align:middle line:90%
and everything.

00:13:19.130 --> 00:13:20.755 align:middle line:84%
And then the poor
mother is left crying

00:13:20.755 --> 00:13:23.030 align:middle line:90%
when their sons are taken down.

00:13:23.030 --> 00:13:25.890 align:middle line:84%
I mean, and this is just
kind of the way it's wired.

00:13:25.890 --> 00:13:26.890 align:middle line:90%
>>OSTERHOFF: Absolutely.

00:13:26.890 --> 00:13:29.350 align:middle line:84%
And it comes down to
these cultural norms

00:13:29.350 --> 00:13:32.020 align:middle line:84%
as well and just
the expectations

00:13:32.020 --> 00:13:35.470 align:middle line:90%
that we have on genders.

00:13:35.470 --> 00:13:38.530 align:middle line:84%
But it is really
important, I think,

00:13:38.530 --> 00:13:44.080 align:middle line:84%
that every leadership role that
is driving our global economy,

00:13:44.080 --> 00:13:47.440 align:middle line:84%
that is driving the
collective healing

00:13:47.440 --> 00:13:51.250 align:middle line:84%
of our world, these positions
really need to be twos.

00:13:51.250 --> 00:13:52.750 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Absolutely.

00:13:52.750 --> 00:13:54.460 align:middle line:84%
>>OSTERHOFF: A
male and a female.

00:13:54.460 --> 00:13:57.095 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Consequence has
to be, long-term view.

00:13:57.095 --> 00:13:57.895 align:middle line:90%
>>OSTERHOFF: Yeah.

00:13:57.895 --> 00:13:58.330 align:middle line:90%
You need both.

00:13:58.330 --> 00:14:00.580 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Reading the net
effect in the end really

00:14:00.580 --> 00:14:02.060 align:middle line:90%
has to be part of the equation.

00:14:02.060 --> 00:14:02.860 align:middle line:90%
And look around.

00:14:02.860 --> 00:14:04.918 align:middle line:90%
It's not, not on any level.

00:14:04.918 --> 00:14:06.460 align:middle line:84%
>>OSTERHOFF: No,
it's absolutely not.

00:14:06.460 --> 00:14:09.220 align:middle line:84%
Our collective
health in this world

00:14:09.220 --> 00:14:12.430 align:middle line:84%
and in humanity and
even the Earth's health,

00:14:12.430 --> 00:14:17.980 align:middle line:84%
it seems like we're on this
brink of breaking, right?

00:14:17.980 --> 00:14:23.110 align:middle line:84%
And the solution, I feel-- and
what I'm seeing is happening

00:14:23.110 --> 00:14:24.280 align:middle line:90%
little by little--

00:14:24.280 --> 00:14:30.160 align:middle line:84%
is honoring the feminine in
partnership with the masculine

00:14:30.160 --> 00:14:33.700 align:middle line:84%
and understanding that we
need both roles in order

00:14:33.700 --> 00:14:37.310 align:middle line:84%
to bring balance and
harmony back into humanity.

00:14:37.310 --> 00:14:38.110 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:14:38.110 --> 00:14:39.910 align:middle line:84%
It can't be this
one-dimensional story

00:14:39.910 --> 00:14:42.220 align:middle line:84%
of these repetitive
cycles because, A,

00:14:42.220 --> 00:14:43.580 align:middle line:90%
that is not reality.

00:14:43.580 --> 00:14:45.730 align:middle line:84%
It's not the nature,
as I said earlier,

00:14:45.730 --> 00:14:47.230 align:middle line:90%
of the Earth and her cycles.

00:14:47.230 --> 00:14:50.140 align:middle line:84%
It's not the nature of
the cosmos and its cycles.

00:14:50.140 --> 00:14:52.720 align:middle line:90%
It's not the nature of beings.

00:14:52.720 --> 00:14:55.240 align:middle line:84%
We go through
troughs, and then we

00:14:55.240 --> 00:14:57.010 align:middle line:84%
go to great heights
and troughs again,

00:14:57.010 --> 00:14:58.990 align:middle line:90%
where we recollect and we learn.

00:14:58.990 --> 00:15:01.170 align:middle line:84%
And then we explore
outward again.

00:15:01.170 --> 00:15:02.170 align:middle line:90%
I mean, this is natural.

00:15:02.170 --> 00:15:06.040 align:middle line:84%
But nothing, not one system
we have is designed--

00:15:06.040 --> 00:15:07.240 align:middle line:90%
based on this.

00:15:07.240 --> 00:15:09.910 align:middle line:84%
So you're one of
the young pioneers

00:15:09.910 --> 00:15:13.910 align:middle line:84%
that's going to be changing that
for all of us in the future.

00:15:13.910 --> 00:15:16.210 align:middle line:84%
So I wanted to go back to
this working memory thing

00:15:16.210 --> 00:15:19.310 align:middle line:84%
because this is a thing that
is very frustrating for women.

00:15:19.310 --> 00:15:20.110 align:middle line:90%
>>OSTERHOFF: Yes.

00:15:20.110 --> 00:15:22.600 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Because
you'll read something--

00:15:22.600 --> 00:15:24.430 align:middle line:90%
I mean, I research a lot, right?

00:15:24.430 --> 00:15:26.960 align:middle line:84%
So I've read a
lot of everything.

00:15:26.960 --> 00:15:31.150 align:middle line:84%
And so I'll understand
something in a subject,

00:15:31.150 --> 00:15:33.400 align:middle line:84%
feel like I have a
grasp on it enough

00:15:33.400 --> 00:15:35.110 align:middle line:90%
that I can converse on it.

00:15:35.110 --> 00:15:38.350 align:middle line:84%
But if I'm with a
man who says, no, no,

00:15:38.350 --> 00:15:41.980 align:middle line:84%
because this particular event
happened on this particular day

00:15:41.980 --> 00:15:44.980 align:middle line:84%
and this happened-- and you
start becoming overwhelmed

00:15:44.980 --> 00:15:49.420 align:middle line:84%
with these very
bald facts that are

00:15:49.420 --> 00:15:52.510 align:middle line:84%
detracting from what you feel
is the larger flow of the story.

00:15:52.510 --> 00:15:55.150 align:middle line:84%
And women generally tend
to shut up at that point,

00:15:55.150 --> 00:15:58.270 align:middle line:84%
feel like, well, OK, if I don't
have the facts at hand-- when

00:15:58.270 --> 00:16:00.370 align:middle line:84%
you can actually see
the flow of the story.

00:16:00.370 --> 00:16:01.880 align:middle line:84%
And you know the
flow of the story.

00:16:01.880 --> 00:16:02.680 align:middle line:90%
>>OSTERHOFF: Yeah.

00:16:02.680 --> 00:16:07.630 align:middle line:84%
So this actually goes back to
a really interesting aspect

00:16:07.630 --> 00:16:12.080 align:middle line:84%
of human development, human
neurological development.

00:16:12.080 --> 00:16:15.280 align:middle line:84%
So when studying
human babies, we

00:16:15.280 --> 00:16:18.760 align:middle line:84%
have found that the
male babies, the boys

00:16:18.760 --> 00:16:24.130 align:middle line:84%
have a stronger reaction
to objects in space.

00:16:24.130 --> 00:16:28.280 align:middle line:84%
And the female babies
have a stronger reaction

00:16:28.280 --> 00:16:34.330 align:middle line:84%
and connection to faces
and emotional output.

00:16:34.330 --> 00:16:38.350 align:middle line:84%
So because of this,
even in adulthood,

00:16:38.350 --> 00:16:41.050 align:middle line:84%
women are more
connected to emotions

00:16:41.050 --> 00:16:43.330 align:middle line:84%
and facial expressions,
where men--

00:16:43.330 --> 00:16:47.420 align:middle line:84%
males-- are more connected
to things in space.

00:16:47.420 --> 00:16:51.100 align:middle line:84%
So this actually aligns with
the different memory capacities

00:16:51.100 --> 00:16:52.450 align:middle line:90%
that we each have, right?

00:16:52.450 --> 00:16:58.660 align:middle line:84%
So with men having a stronger
capacity for this working

00:16:58.660 --> 00:17:01.655 align:middle line:84%
memory, that makes sense because
it's objects of space facts.

00:17:01.655 --> 00:17:02.455 align:middle line:90%
It's timelines.

00:17:02.455 --> 00:17:03.580 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Data, facts and--

00:17:03.580 --> 00:17:07.640 align:middle line:84%
>>OSTERHOFF: Whereas women have
a stronger episodic memory,

00:17:07.640 --> 00:17:11.050 align:middle line:84%
which is about the emotional
undercurrent of the situations.

00:17:11.050 --> 00:17:12.609 align:middle line:90%
It's the story.

00:17:12.609 --> 00:17:14.740 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And how the
story played out, yeah.

00:17:14.740 --> 00:17:15.540 align:middle line:90%
>>OSTERHOFF: Yes.

00:17:15.540 --> 00:17:17.680 align:middle line:84%
So if we think
about this, how we

00:17:17.680 --> 00:17:21.160 align:middle line:84%
are teaching our young people
should align with this, right?

00:17:21.160 --> 00:17:24.010 align:middle line:84%
We should have a
combination of timeline

00:17:24.010 --> 00:17:28.000 align:middle line:84%
and facts and stories that
are just as important.

00:17:28.000 --> 00:17:31.210 align:middle line:84%
Learning those emotional
undercurrents of situations

00:17:31.210 --> 00:17:35.800 align:middle line:84%
is going to help young
women to understand history,

00:17:35.800 --> 00:17:39.370 align:middle line:84%
to understand certain
subjects, and for them

00:17:39.370 --> 00:17:40.523 align:middle line:90%
to retain that information.

00:17:40.523 --> 00:17:42.190 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: But how do
we get to the point

00:17:42.190 --> 00:17:44.110 align:middle line:84%
where women aren't
intimidated to speak up

00:17:44.110 --> 00:17:46.930 align:middle line:84%
even if they may understand
the episodic flow

00:17:46.930 --> 00:17:49.810 align:middle line:90%
of a historical event very well?

00:17:49.810 --> 00:17:53.050 align:middle line:84%
Stand up against the facts
that are being tossed out there

00:17:53.050 --> 00:17:54.580 align:middle line:90%
by, say, a guy.

00:17:54.580 --> 00:17:59.470 align:middle line:84%
>>OSTERHOFF: Well, it's because
we have this cultural default

00:17:59.470 --> 00:18:03.580 align:middle line:84%
to the male model and what is
important to the male model.

00:18:03.580 --> 00:18:06.370 align:middle line:84%
Now in my opinion,
this is not something

00:18:06.370 --> 00:18:09.700 align:middle line:84%
that we created on purpose it's
kind of just something that

00:18:09.700 --> 00:18:12.970 align:middle line:84%
happened because our
data is male-centric

00:18:12.970 --> 00:18:16.870 align:middle line:84%
and our world is driven
by data, evidence-based.

00:18:16.870 --> 00:18:22.060 align:middle line:84%
So because we have gotten
to this place where

00:18:22.060 --> 00:18:24.940 align:middle line:84%
the male model is
the default, what's

00:18:24.940 --> 00:18:29.530 align:middle line:84%
important for the male
model to thrive and operate

00:18:29.530 --> 00:18:32.530 align:middle line:84%
at their highest level
has become important

00:18:32.530 --> 00:18:34.450 align:middle line:90%
on a societal level.

00:18:34.450 --> 00:18:37.750 align:middle line:84%
Now the solution,
to me, is we just

00:18:37.750 --> 00:18:41.020 align:middle line:84%
need to bring awareness
around the female model.

00:18:41.020 --> 00:18:45.730 align:middle line:84%
We need to start normalizing the
female model at the same level

00:18:45.730 --> 00:18:46.780 align:middle line:90%
as the male model.

00:18:46.780 --> 00:18:49.460 align:middle line:84%
We need to start teaching the
female model, which we do not

00:18:49.460 --> 00:18:50.260 align:middle line:90%
do.

00:18:50.260 --> 00:18:50.710 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:18:50.710 --> 00:18:52.793 align:middle line:84%
>>OSTERHOFF: For instance,
if you go back into any

00:18:52.793 --> 00:18:54.520 align:middle line:90%
of your biology textbooks, go--

00:18:54.520 --> 00:18:57.370 align:middle line:84%
if you have one at home,
go back and look at it.

00:18:57.370 --> 00:19:00.340 align:middle line:84%
Page after page after page,
what are you going to find?

00:19:00.340 --> 00:19:03.010 align:middle line:84%
The male model, because
it's the default.

00:19:03.010 --> 00:19:04.990 align:middle line:84%
It's because it's what
the data that we have,

00:19:04.990 --> 00:19:06.260 align:middle line:90%
it's what we teach.

00:19:06.260 --> 00:19:09.340 align:middle line:84%
But the only place you're
going to find the female model

00:19:09.340 --> 00:19:11.140 align:middle line:84%
specifically is
when we're talking

00:19:11.140 --> 00:19:13.000 align:middle line:90%
about reproductive health.

00:19:13.000 --> 00:19:13.930 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: [LAUGHS]

00:19:13.930 --> 00:19:16.120 align:middle line:84%
>>OSTERHOFF: Women's
health has been boiled down

00:19:16.120 --> 00:19:17.200 align:middle line:90%
to reproductive health.

00:19:17.200 --> 00:19:19.120 align:middle line:90%
And that's only one tiny aspect.

00:19:19.120 --> 00:19:21.010 align:middle line:84%
There's everything
else that we just

00:19:21.010 --> 00:19:24.010 align:middle line:84%
don't understand that
has implications on women

00:19:24.010 --> 00:19:26.540 align:middle line:84%
and their role and
function in society.

00:19:26.540 --> 00:19:28.930 align:middle line:84%
So we need to start
teaching that so that,

00:19:28.930 --> 00:19:31.270 align:middle line:84%
on a societal level,
what's important

00:19:31.270 --> 00:19:34.720 align:middle line:84%
for women to operate
and thrive becomes also

00:19:34.720 --> 00:19:36.370 align:middle line:90%
important on a societal level.

00:19:36.370 --> 00:19:38.080 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: It makes total sense.

00:19:38.080 --> 00:19:40.510 align:middle line:84%
Now we get into
something that's dicey.

00:19:40.510 --> 00:19:43.000 align:middle line:84%
And we have a lot to talk
about, men and dopamine.

00:19:43.000 --> 00:19:45.430 align:middle line:84%
There's so much to talk
about here, oxytocin.

00:19:45.430 --> 00:19:47.840 align:middle line:84%
But let's talk about
politics for a moment.

00:19:47.840 --> 00:19:51.230 align:middle line:84%
So the politics right now are
to degenderize the population

00:19:51.230 --> 00:19:52.630 align:middle line:84%
so we don't really
have masculine

00:19:52.630 --> 00:19:53.500 align:middle line:90%
and don't have feminine.

00:19:53.500 --> 00:19:54.300 align:middle line:90%
>>OSTERHOFF: Yes.

00:19:54.300 --> 00:19:57.520 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: But you can't get
away from that when what

00:19:57.520 --> 00:19:58.930 align:middle line:90%
we're talking about--

00:19:58.930 --> 00:20:00.550 align:middle line:90%
we are male and female.

00:20:00.550 --> 00:20:02.110 align:middle line:84%
Our brains do
operate differently.

00:20:02.110 --> 00:20:04.570 align:middle line:84%
Our bodies biologically
operate differently.

00:20:04.570 --> 00:20:07.983 align:middle line:84%
How do you navigate
the political landscape

00:20:07.983 --> 00:20:10.150 align:middle line:84%
when people are saying,
well, you can't divide us up

00:20:10.150 --> 00:20:11.710 align:middle line:90%
like that, male and female?

00:20:11.710 --> 00:20:13.810 align:middle line:84%
>>OSTERHOFF: Well,
what I'm talking about

00:20:13.810 --> 00:20:18.510 align:middle line:84%
is biology and neurology
and physiology.

00:20:18.510 --> 00:20:21.110 align:middle line:84%
And when I'm talking
male and female,

00:20:21.110 --> 00:20:23.400 align:middle line:90%
this is on a chromosomal level.

00:20:23.400 --> 00:20:26.570 align:middle line:84%
So even those who don't
identify as female

00:20:26.570 --> 00:20:29.540 align:middle line:84%
but were born with
the female chromosomes

00:20:29.540 --> 00:20:31.560 align:middle line:84%
carry that throughout
their entire lives.

00:20:31.560 --> 00:20:34.050 align:middle line:84%
So they still operate in the
way that we're talking about,

00:20:34.050 --> 00:20:34.850 align:middle line:90%
right?

00:20:34.850 --> 00:20:35.650 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:20:35.650 --> 00:20:38.420 align:middle line:10%
>>OSTERHOFF: So anyone, no
matter how they identify

00:20:38.420 --> 00:20:39.810 align:middle line:10%
as male or female--

00:20:39.810 --> 00:20:44.480 align:middle line:10%
and I totally understand
these issues around gender.

00:20:44.480 --> 00:20:48.990 align:middle line:84%
And I'm very cognizant and
sensitive to those things.

00:20:48.990 --> 00:20:51.710 align:middle line:84%
However, no matter
how you identify,

00:20:51.710 --> 00:20:53.035 align:middle line:90%
the scientific underpinnings--

00:20:53.035 --> 00:20:54.785 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Certain
chemicals are chemicals.

00:20:54.785 --> 00:20:56.368 align:middle line:84%
>>OSTERHOFF: It is
the way that it is.

00:20:56.368 --> 00:20:59.810 align:middle line:84%
So we do need to
understand both so

00:20:59.810 --> 00:21:01.550 align:middle line:90%
that we can support all people.

00:21:01.550 --> 00:21:04.100 align:middle line:84%
Now here's the
thing where I think

00:21:04.100 --> 00:21:06.450 align:middle line:84%
we've gotten it wrong
on a societal level.

00:21:06.450 --> 00:21:09.290 align:middle line:84%
I think we can all agree,
or most of us in the world

00:21:09.290 --> 00:21:13.730 align:middle line:84%
can all agree, that we want
peace and equality, right?

00:21:13.730 --> 00:21:17.360 align:middle line:84%
But the problem is the
strategy that we've taken

00:21:17.360 --> 00:21:19.700 align:middle line:90%
to come to a place of equality.

00:21:19.700 --> 00:21:21.480 align:middle line:90%
The strategy is wrong.

00:21:21.480 --> 00:21:24.350 align:middle line:84%
What we have done is
level the playing field,

00:21:24.350 --> 00:21:27.050 align:middle line:84%
standardize everything,
and create the same playing

00:21:27.050 --> 00:21:30.620 align:middle line:84%
field for everyone to come in
and be able to play on, right?

00:21:30.620 --> 00:21:35.120 align:middle line:84%
So the problem is we actually
need a playing field that

00:21:35.120 --> 00:21:37.580 align:middle line:84%
is expansive enough
and customizable enough

00:21:37.580 --> 00:21:41.300 align:middle line:84%
to meet the unique
needs and strengths

00:21:41.300 --> 00:21:46.200 align:middle line:84%
and qualities of each person,
including male and female.

00:21:46.200 --> 00:21:47.000 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah, no.

00:21:47.000 --> 00:21:48.410 align:middle line:90%
That makes perfect sense.

00:21:48.410 --> 00:21:52.280 align:middle line:84%
And so we're not looking to--
oftentimes, it has been--

00:21:52.280 --> 00:21:56.210 align:middle line:84%
it's kind of a common term
that within every male is--

00:21:56.210 --> 00:21:58.760 align:middle line:84%
within the male is the
female, and within the female

00:21:58.760 --> 00:22:00.820 align:middle line:90%
is the male, and all of that.

00:22:00.820 --> 00:22:01.620 align:middle line:90%
>>OSTERHOFF: Yeah.

00:22:01.620 --> 00:22:03.120 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: But the
reality is, you're

00:22:03.120 --> 00:22:06.830 align:middle line:84%
talking about functional,
physiological,

00:22:06.830 --> 00:22:09.570 align:middle line:84%
biological,
neurological realities.

00:22:09.570 --> 00:22:10.370 align:middle line:90%
>>OSTERHOFF: Yes.

00:22:10.370 --> 00:22:11.787 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So let
me ask you again.

00:22:11.787 --> 00:22:15.030 align:middle line:84%
This is another one because
we're coming up now and seeing

00:22:15.030 --> 00:22:18.030 align:middle line:84%
more and more of it, which is
when you go to transgender when

00:22:18.030 --> 00:22:20.880 align:middle line:84%
you're talking about taking
hormones, a female taking

00:22:20.880 --> 00:22:24.750 align:middle line:84%
male hormones, for example,
and vice versa, now

00:22:24.750 --> 00:22:26.400 align:middle line:90%
what is that doing?

00:22:26.400 --> 00:22:28.570 align:middle line:90%
What does that do to the brain?

00:22:28.570 --> 00:22:31.620 align:middle line:84%
>>OSTERHOFF: Well,
what I would assume

00:22:31.620 --> 00:22:33.510 align:middle line:84%
is it's very confusing
for the brain

00:22:33.510 --> 00:22:37.770 align:middle line:84%
because the ovarian
hormones are extremely

00:22:37.770 --> 00:22:42.070 align:middle line:84%
important and impactful for
female neurology and cognitive

00:22:42.070 --> 00:22:42.870 align:middle line:90%
development.

00:22:42.870 --> 00:22:43.670 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:22:43.670 --> 00:22:46.560 align:middle line:84%
>>OSTERHOFF: And
testosterone is also

00:22:46.560 --> 00:22:48.810 align:middle line:84%
important for the
male brain, but not

00:22:48.810 --> 00:22:51.130 align:middle line:90%
on the same level of capacity.

00:22:51.130 --> 00:22:54.450 align:middle line:84%
So when you are
eliminating or modulating

00:22:54.450 --> 00:22:56.130 align:middle line:84%
these hormones, of
course it's going

00:22:56.130 --> 00:22:58.920 align:middle line:90%
to have a physiological impact.

00:22:58.920 --> 00:23:02.277 align:middle line:84%
The problem is we certainly
don't study transgender, right?

00:23:02.277 --> 00:23:04.110 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: No, we're not
even studying women.

00:23:04.110 --> 00:23:05.220 align:middle line:84%
>>OSTERHOFF: If we're
not studying women,

00:23:05.220 --> 00:23:06.315 align:middle line:90%
we're not studying transgender.

00:23:06.315 --> 00:23:07.115 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Exactly.

00:23:07.115 --> 00:23:09.960 align:middle line:84%
>>OSTERHOFF: They're an
even greater blind spot

00:23:09.960 --> 00:23:11.640 align:middle line:90%
in our scientific inquiry.

00:23:11.640 --> 00:23:15.120 align:middle line:84%
So my answer is, I don't know
because we're not studying it.

00:23:15.120 --> 00:23:16.050 align:middle line:90%
So I don't know--

00:23:16.050 --> 00:23:17.520 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: You can only
guess what would happen.

00:23:17.520 --> 00:23:19.853 align:middle line:84%
>>OSTERHOFF: --what those
long-term qualifications would

00:23:19.853 --> 00:23:22.260 align:middle line:84%
be, but I could imagine that
for the brain specifically,

00:23:22.260 --> 00:23:25.480 align:middle line:90%
it would be very confusing.

00:23:25.480 --> 00:23:28.950 align:middle line:84%
So we really need to
study transgender folks

00:23:28.950 --> 00:23:31.860 align:middle line:84%
and their neurology and the
impact of these hormones,

00:23:31.860 --> 00:23:36.540 align:middle line:84%
because we know that hormones
have a global modulatory impact

00:23:36.540 --> 00:23:38.170 align:middle line:90%
on everything in our bodies.

00:23:38.170 --> 00:23:42.325 align:middle line:84%
It's not just localized
to sex and reproduction.

00:23:42.325 --> 00:23:43.125 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:23:43.125 --> 00:23:45.092 align:middle line:84%
And since you said
the word globalized,

00:23:45.092 --> 00:23:46.800 align:middle line:84%
I'm going to hop back
in the conversation

00:23:46.800 --> 00:23:49.590 align:middle line:84%
because I went astray on the
politics and transgenderism

00:23:49.590 --> 00:23:51.550 align:middle line:90%
because I'm curious about it.

00:23:51.550 --> 00:23:54.840 align:middle line:84%
But one of the other
aspects of the female brain

00:23:54.840 --> 00:23:57.510 align:middle line:84%
is that the two hemispheres
along the centrioles

00:23:57.510 --> 00:24:00.630 align:middle line:84%
seem to communicate
a little more easily.

00:24:00.630 --> 00:24:05.880 align:middle line:84%
Now that seems to me like it
would have some very important

00:24:05.880 --> 00:24:07.173 align:middle line:90%
ramifications.

00:24:07.173 --> 00:24:08.340 align:middle line:90%
>>OSTERHOFF: Oh, absolutely.

00:24:08.340 --> 00:24:12.270 align:middle line:84%
It really changes everything
about what we understand

00:24:12.270 --> 00:24:14.000 align:middle line:90%
about the human brain.

00:24:14.000 --> 00:24:15.950 align:middle line:84%
How many times have
you heard like, oh, I'm

00:24:15.950 --> 00:24:18.350 align:middle line:84%
a left versus
right brain, right?

00:24:18.350 --> 00:24:22.340 align:middle line:84%
That's actually more in
alignment with the male brain,

00:24:22.340 --> 00:24:27.170 align:middle line:84%
because the male brain has more
localized, regional activity.

00:24:27.170 --> 00:24:30.800 align:middle line:84%
And it has a stronger
dominance of left or right.

00:24:30.800 --> 00:24:32.810 align:middle line:84%
But the female brain
is not really--

00:24:32.810 --> 00:24:34.430 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So you
mean like vacillating

00:24:34.430 --> 00:24:35.907 align:middle line:90%
between left and right?

00:24:35.907 --> 00:24:36.740 align:middle line:90%
>>OSTERHOFF: Mm-hmm.

00:24:36.740 --> 00:24:40.250 align:middle line:84%
Yeah there's
typically-- each person,

00:24:40.250 --> 00:24:43.490 align:middle line:84%
each male will have
a propensity to be

00:24:43.490 --> 00:24:45.800 align:middle line:90%
more left- or right-brained.

00:24:45.800 --> 00:24:49.220 align:middle line:84%
And you could technically
say that about women.

00:24:49.220 --> 00:24:51.080 align:middle line:90%
But it's not a one-to-one.

00:24:51.080 --> 00:24:53.670 align:middle line:84%
It's not really an
accurate comparison.

00:24:53.670 --> 00:24:59.930 align:middle line:84%
So with women, because of
these denser neural networks,

00:24:59.930 --> 00:25:04.490 align:middle line:84%
there is more connectivity
between brain hemispheres

00:25:04.490 --> 00:25:05.850 align:middle line:90%
and regions.

00:25:05.850 --> 00:25:11.480 align:middle line:84%
So what this translates
to is a global processing

00:25:11.480 --> 00:25:14.770 align:middle line:84%
of information, a more global
processing of information.

00:25:14.770 --> 00:25:18.660 align:middle line:84%
That's why women tend to
have an easier time thinking

00:25:18.660 --> 00:25:20.160 align:middle line:90%
big picture.

00:25:20.160 --> 00:25:23.620 align:middle line:84%
They can pull in all the
different information,

00:25:23.620 --> 00:25:26.880 align:middle line:84%
including the information
that is not physically seen

00:25:26.880 --> 00:25:30.510 align:middle line:84%
or touched, that emotional
undercurrent information.

00:25:30.510 --> 00:25:31.440 align:middle line:90%
And they process that.

00:25:31.440 --> 00:25:33.900 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: They mix that
with all of the data

00:25:33.900 --> 00:25:37.330 align:middle line:84%
and the ordinary kind of
left-brain processing.

00:25:37.330 --> 00:25:38.130 align:middle line:90%
>>OSTERHOFF: Yeah.

00:25:38.130 --> 00:25:40.630 align:middle line:84%
So this goes back to
a woman's intuition,

00:25:40.630 --> 00:25:43.110 align:middle line:84%
which again, is a real thing
that we are understanding.

00:25:43.110 --> 00:25:46.200 align:middle line:84%
And I also just want to make
the caveat that intuition

00:25:46.200 --> 00:25:49.690 align:middle line:84%
and emotional processing
and productivity,

00:25:49.690 --> 00:25:52.230 align:middle line:84%
these are qualities that
all humans have, right?

00:25:52.230 --> 00:25:56.940 align:middle line:84%
But what I'm talking about is
the neurological propensity

00:25:56.940 --> 00:26:02.020 align:middle line:84%
and the strength that each
male and female has naturally.

00:26:02.020 --> 00:26:02.820 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:26:02.820 --> 00:26:05.880 align:middle line:84%
OK, so going back to
the male because we

00:26:05.880 --> 00:26:07.260 align:middle line:84%
have a lot of
women watching that

00:26:07.260 --> 00:26:08.940 align:middle line:84%
have little boys
and little girls.

00:26:08.940 --> 00:26:11.100 align:middle line:84%
And we have to see
the strengths of each.

00:26:11.100 --> 00:26:14.450 align:middle line:84%
And we're not try to condemn
them and behave like the other.

00:26:14.450 --> 00:26:15.480 align:middle line:90%
This is what I'm saying.

00:26:15.480 --> 00:26:18.483 align:middle line:84%
I think the
degenderization, that's

00:26:18.483 --> 00:26:20.900 align:middle line:84%
where it's not a good idea,
when you don't let people live

00:26:20.900 --> 00:26:22.790 align:middle line:84%
their natural state
and you're politically

00:26:22.790 --> 00:26:25.820 align:middle line:84%
trying to move them into
another state of being

00:26:25.820 --> 00:26:27.530 align:middle line:84%
and a way of
thinking and feeling

00:26:27.530 --> 00:26:30.030 align:middle line:84%
that's not accurate
for them personally.

00:26:30.030 --> 00:26:30.830 align:middle line:90%
>>OSTERHOFF: Yes.

00:26:30.830 --> 00:26:34.250 align:middle line:84%
Well, and it also perpetuates
a couple of issues

00:26:34.250 --> 00:26:39.330 align:middle line:84%
that we have globally,
which is a loss of identity.

00:26:39.330 --> 00:26:40.130 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:26:40.130 --> 00:26:41.240 align:middle line:90%
>>OSTERHOFF: Across the globe.

00:26:41.240 --> 00:26:41.600 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:26:41.600 --> 00:26:44.183 align:middle line:84%
>>OSTERHOFF: And when it comes
to women, this loss of identity

00:26:44.183 --> 00:26:47.840 align:middle line:84%
comes from a taught
detachment from our bodies,

00:26:47.840 --> 00:26:50.060 align:middle line:84%
from our natural
cycles and rhythms,

00:26:50.060 --> 00:26:53.780 align:middle line:84%
from our natural
abilities, from the way

00:26:53.780 --> 00:26:56.450 align:middle line:84%
our brain operates because
we just didn't know

00:26:56.450 --> 00:26:58.100 align:middle line:90%
and we didn't understand.

00:26:58.100 --> 00:27:01.140 align:middle line:84%
And we thought that it was the
same for males and females.

00:27:01.140 --> 00:27:05.200 align:middle line:84%
But the solution is
honoring our differences.

00:27:05.200 --> 00:27:06.388 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Absolutely.

00:27:06.388 --> 00:27:08.180 align:middle line:84%
>>OSTERHOFF: Acknowledging
our differences.

00:27:08.180 --> 00:27:09.688 align:middle line:84%
And not trying to
get rid of them.

00:27:09.688 --> 00:27:11.480 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And they work
perfectly together.

00:27:11.480 --> 00:27:15.400 align:middle line:84%
It's the two working together
that makes the whole possible.

00:27:15.400 --> 00:27:18.060 align:middle line:84%
So let's look at, now, the
little boys and the men.

00:27:18.060 --> 00:27:21.700 align:middle line:10%
Dopamine-regulated
systems, reward-driven.

00:27:21.700 --> 00:27:22.500 align:middle line:90%
>>OSTERHOFF: Yes.

00:27:22.500 --> 00:27:23.833 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Let's talk about that.

00:27:23.833 --> 00:27:25.620 align:middle line:84%
>>OSTERHOFF: Yeah,
so the male brain

00:27:25.620 --> 00:27:29.160 align:middle line:84%
is reward-driven,
as you mentioned,

00:27:29.160 --> 00:27:32.400 align:middle line:84%
because dopamine is the
master neuroregulator

00:27:32.400 --> 00:27:34.800 align:middle line:90%
for the male neurology.

00:27:34.800 --> 00:27:38.700 align:middle line:84%
And for the endocrine
cascade that happens,

00:27:38.700 --> 00:27:41.130 align:middle line:84%
the neuroendocrine
cascade that happens,

00:27:41.130 --> 00:27:45.750 align:middle line:84%
dopamine is the supportive
driving factor there.

00:27:45.750 --> 00:27:47.890 align:middle line:90%
For women, it's very different.

00:27:47.890 --> 00:27:50.340 align:middle line:90%
It's oxytocin-regulated.

00:27:50.340 --> 00:27:52.860 align:middle line:84%
So oxytocin is the
master neuroregulator

00:27:52.860 --> 00:27:55.950 align:middle line:84%
for women, which means
that the female brain

00:27:55.950 --> 00:28:00.210 align:middle line:84%
and the female physiology
is more connection-based.

00:28:00.210 --> 00:28:03.100 align:middle line:90%
Because what is oxytocin about?

00:28:03.100 --> 00:28:05.100 align:middle line:90%
It's called the cuddle hormone.

00:28:05.100 --> 00:28:07.740 align:middle line:84%
And yes, when you hug somebody,
you can get some oxytocin.

00:28:07.740 --> 00:28:09.090 align:middle line:90%
But that's not all it is.

00:28:09.090 --> 00:28:11.110 align:middle line:90%
It's about feeling connected.

00:28:11.110 --> 00:28:11.910 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:28:11.910 --> 00:28:13.770 align:middle line:84%
>>OSTERHOFF: So it
takes us full circle

00:28:13.770 --> 00:28:17.160 align:middle line:84%
to what is that
neuropsychological gift

00:28:17.160 --> 00:28:19.230 align:middle line:90%
of the female neurology?

00:28:19.230 --> 00:28:22.590 align:middle line:84%
It's this ability to
think for the collective.

00:28:22.590 --> 00:28:23.940 align:middle line:90%
It's about being connected.

00:28:23.940 --> 00:28:25.990 align:middle line:84%
It's about
understanding emotions.

00:28:25.990 --> 00:28:27.150 align:middle line:90%
It's about compassion.

00:28:27.150 --> 00:28:28.770 align:middle line:90%
It's about empathy, right?

00:28:28.770 --> 00:28:32.010 align:middle line:84%
So it all matches
up perfectly to

00:28:32.010 --> 00:28:35.020 align:middle line:84%
this beautiful
feminine leadership,

00:28:35.020 --> 00:28:38.520 align:middle line:84%
which is different than
the masculine leadership.

00:28:38.520 --> 00:28:41.070 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Yeah, and some of
this is very misunderstood.

00:28:41.070 --> 00:28:45.270 align:middle line:84%
And you almost have to turn to
fields of entertainment, films

00:28:45.270 --> 00:28:48.880 align:middle line:84%
and novels and so forth,
and music in particular,

00:28:48.880 --> 00:28:50.730 align:middle line:90%
when you think of this.

00:28:50.730 --> 00:28:53.130 align:middle line:84%
And you think, OK, the women,
they have the love hormone.

00:28:53.130 --> 00:28:54.630 align:middle line:90%
They have the oxytocin.

00:28:54.630 --> 00:28:57.210 align:middle line:84%
And so they're
concerned and they're

00:28:57.210 --> 00:29:00.480 align:middle line:84%
in love with their little
children and love, love, love.

00:29:00.480 --> 00:29:02.640 align:middle line:84%
And then what
happens is the male

00:29:02.640 --> 00:29:04.830 align:middle line:84%
seems to be marginalized
in that area, where

00:29:04.830 --> 00:29:08.790 align:middle line:84%
oftentimes the type of love
that males represent and express

00:29:08.790 --> 00:29:11.820 align:middle line:84%
in the world is
almost life-altering.

00:29:11.820 --> 00:29:15.690 align:middle line:84%
It's life-altering, in a way,
for them on a different level,

00:29:15.690 --> 00:29:18.660 align:middle line:84%
the type of love that
these beautiful songs

00:29:18.660 --> 00:29:22.380 align:middle line:84%
and books and such have
been written about.

00:29:22.380 --> 00:29:26.190 align:middle line:84%
So what is it in the
male model of love--

00:29:26.190 --> 00:29:30.030 align:middle line:84%
what is the hallmark of that
makes it so kind of extreme

00:29:30.030 --> 00:29:32.760 align:middle line:90%
and committed and focused?

00:29:32.760 --> 00:29:36.540 align:middle line:84%
>>OSTERHOFF: So committed and
focused is the core component,

00:29:36.540 --> 00:29:40.440 align:middle line:84%
because remember, the
gift of the male neurology

00:29:40.440 --> 00:29:41.880 align:middle line:90%
is productivity, right?

00:29:41.880 --> 00:29:43.770 align:middle line:90%
Being able to produce.

00:29:43.770 --> 00:29:48.510 align:middle line:84%
Even the male physiology when
it comes to how we reproduce,

00:29:48.510 --> 00:29:52.590 align:middle line:84%
it's about producing,
spreading the seed, right?

00:29:52.590 --> 00:29:57.780 align:middle line:84%
Whereas the female physiology
is about creativity,

00:29:57.780 --> 00:29:58.620 align:middle line:90%
creating life.

00:29:58.620 --> 00:30:00.870 align:middle line:90%
It's a different energy.

00:30:00.870 --> 00:30:03.640 align:middle line:84%
And it is connected in with
that love and connection

00:30:03.640 --> 00:30:04.440 align:middle line:90%
with your family.

00:30:04.440 --> 00:30:06.435 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Different kind
of love than the male.

00:30:06.435 --> 00:30:07.602 align:middle line:90%
>>OSTERHOFF: Different, yes.

00:30:07.602 --> 00:30:12.780 align:middle line:84%
And with males, oftentimes
the way that they express love

00:30:12.780 --> 00:30:17.190 align:middle line:84%
will be more through the
doing, through the providing,

00:30:17.190 --> 00:30:19.960 align:middle line:84%
through the safety,
through the container.

00:30:19.960 --> 00:30:21.180 align:middle line:90%
Yeah so it's different.

00:30:21.180 --> 00:30:23.438 align:middle line:84%
But both are absolutely
so important and needed.

00:30:23.438 --> 00:30:24.480 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Oh, absolutely.

00:30:24.480 --> 00:30:25.515 align:middle line:90%
And both are as intense.

00:30:25.515 --> 00:30:26.640 align:middle line:90%
>>OSTERHOFF: Yes, they are.

00:30:26.640 --> 00:30:28.182 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: It's
important to say that.

00:30:28.182 --> 00:30:31.710 align:middle line:84%
Just because men don't
create as much oxytocin,

00:30:31.710 --> 00:30:33.450 align:middle line:84%
it doesn't mean the
love isn't there.

00:30:33.450 --> 00:30:33.960 align:middle line:90%
It is.

00:30:33.960 --> 00:30:34.760 align:middle line:90%
>>OSTERHOFF: No.

00:30:34.760 --> 00:30:37.093 align:middle line:84%
But another important piece
about this oxytocin versus--

00:30:37.093 --> 00:30:37.893 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Dopamine.

00:30:37.893 --> 00:30:39.330 align:middle line:84%
>>OSTERHOFF:
--dopamine regulation

00:30:39.330 --> 00:30:42.160 align:middle line:84%
is, when you look
into our society,

00:30:42.160 --> 00:30:45.690 align:middle line:84%
it's very
dopamine-driven, right?

00:30:45.690 --> 00:30:49.710 align:middle line:84%
Checking things off the
to-do list, social media, all

00:30:49.710 --> 00:30:53.610 align:middle line:84%
this stimulation, the way that
we have set up our world to be

00:30:53.610 --> 00:30:56.220 align:middle line:84%
goal-oriented and
step-by-step process,

00:30:56.220 --> 00:30:58.380 align:middle line:90%
all that is dopamine-driven.

00:30:58.380 --> 00:31:01.980 align:middle line:84%
And that's why, typically,
men have an easier time

00:31:01.980 --> 00:31:04.590 align:middle line:84%
operating in these
systems, because they're

00:31:04.590 --> 00:31:06.840 align:middle line:90%
regulated by that.

00:31:06.840 --> 00:31:09.240 align:middle line:84%
It doesn't mean that too much
dopamine isn't bad for them

00:31:09.240 --> 00:31:10.890 align:middle line:90%
just like it is for anyone.

00:31:10.890 --> 00:31:12.420 align:middle line:90%
But it is healthier.

00:31:12.420 --> 00:31:17.460 align:middle line:84%
And then for women, this
dopamine-driven society

00:31:17.460 --> 00:31:20.190 align:middle line:84%
is very problematic
because dopamine actually

00:31:20.190 --> 00:31:21.638 align:middle line:90%
squelches oxytocin.

00:31:21.638 --> 00:31:22.930 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: It makes total sense.

00:31:22.930 --> 00:31:25.472 align:middle line:84%
>>OSTERHOFF: And we're already
not getting enough opportunity

00:31:25.472 --> 00:31:27.220 align:middle line:90%
for oxytocin in our society.

00:31:27.220 --> 00:31:31.060 align:middle line:84%
It's not a priority even though
it's so crucial and important

00:31:31.060 --> 00:31:31.860 align:middle line:90%
for women.

00:31:31.860 --> 00:31:33.810 align:middle line:84%
And then we have all
this dopamine flooding

00:31:33.810 --> 00:31:37.200 align:middle line:84%
in that is taking those
oxytocin levels down even more.

00:31:37.200 --> 00:31:41.277 align:middle line:84%
So we're deprived from
our master neuroregulator.

00:31:41.277 --> 00:31:42.360 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: We're burnt out.

00:31:42.360 --> 00:31:43.360 align:middle line:90%
Women are burnt out.

00:31:43.360 --> 00:31:45.510 align:middle line:84%
I mean, I wake up, and
as soon as I open up

00:31:45.510 --> 00:31:48.510 align:middle line:84%
my computer, look at my
iPhone, and the email list,

00:31:48.510 --> 00:31:49.830 align:middle line:90%
I want to go back to bed.

00:31:49.830 --> 00:31:50.100 align:middle line:90%
>>OSTERHOFF: Yes.

00:31:50.100 --> 00:31:51.870 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: To me, it's
overwhelming and exhausting

00:31:51.870 --> 00:31:52.940 align:middle line:90%
and not enjoyable at all.

00:31:52.940 --> 00:31:53.940 align:middle line:90%
>>OSTERHOFF: Absolutely.

00:31:53.940 --> 00:31:54.870 align:middle line:90%
It absolutely is.

00:31:54.870 --> 00:31:55.670 align:middle line:90%
And that's, again--

00:31:55.670 --> 00:31:58.320 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Other people, men
in particular, it's a buzz.

00:31:58.320 --> 00:32:00.780 align:middle line:84%
It's something to
engage with and tick off

00:32:00.780 --> 00:32:02.190 align:middle line:90%
number 1, 2, and 3.

00:32:02.190 --> 00:32:04.410 align:middle line:84%
We are all-- we're very
different that way.

00:32:04.410 --> 00:32:05.827 align:middle line:84%
>>OSTERHOFF: We're
very different.

00:32:05.827 --> 00:32:07.350 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So let's
talk about how

00:32:07.350 --> 00:32:09.960 align:middle line:84%
we start incorporating
the understanding

00:32:09.960 --> 00:32:15.700 align:middle line:84%
of the female neurobiology into
the workplace, for example.

00:32:15.700 --> 00:32:19.630 align:middle line:84%
>>OSTERHOFF: So again,
what this boils down to

00:32:19.630 --> 00:32:27.460 align:middle line:84%
is creating a more expansive,
more inclusive environment,

00:32:27.460 --> 00:32:29.950 align:middle line:84%
a playing field,
you can call it.

00:32:29.950 --> 00:32:32.650 align:middle line:84%
So kind of going back to
this playing field idea,

00:32:32.650 --> 00:32:35.680 align:middle line:84%
let's say that you
have Michael Jordan,

00:32:35.680 --> 00:32:37.480 align:middle line:90%
a player, an amazing player.

00:32:37.480 --> 00:32:40.480 align:middle line:84%
And then you have
Tom Brady, right?

00:32:40.480 --> 00:32:42.130 align:middle line:84%
He's a really great
football player.

00:32:42.130 --> 00:32:43.870 align:middle line:84%
So you have Michael
Jordan and Tom Brady.

00:32:43.870 --> 00:32:45.790 align:middle line:84%
And you drop them both
on the football field,

00:32:45.790 --> 00:32:47.680 align:middle line:84%
and you say, play
your best game.

00:32:47.680 --> 00:32:49.097 align:middle line:84%
Who's going to
play the best game?

00:32:49.097 --> 00:32:49.897 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:32:49.897 --> 00:32:51.650 align:middle line:84%
>>OSTERHOFF: They're
both amazing players.

00:32:51.650 --> 00:32:53.740 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Athletes,
but different sports.

00:32:53.740 --> 00:32:57.250 align:middle line:84%
>>OSTERHOFF: But the playing
field is only adapted to one.

00:32:57.250 --> 00:32:59.360 align:middle line:84%
So that's what we
have in the workplace.

00:32:59.360 --> 00:33:01.750 align:middle line:84%
We have a playing field
that is very male-centric,

00:33:01.750 --> 00:33:04.000 align:middle line:84%
but both men and women are
dropped in and expected

00:33:04.000 --> 00:33:05.170 align:middle line:90%
to play their best game.

00:33:05.170 --> 00:33:07.910 align:middle line:84%
And they are both
amazing players.

00:33:07.910 --> 00:33:12.470 align:middle line:84%
So we need to create a more
adaptive, a more expansive,

00:33:12.470 --> 00:33:14.650 align:middle line:84%
more inclusive
playing field that

00:33:14.650 --> 00:33:18.850 align:middle line:84%
can allow the flexibility
that women need in order

00:33:18.850 --> 00:33:21.490 align:middle line:84%
to operate in this
ebb and flow way

00:33:21.490 --> 00:33:23.740 align:middle line:84%
that their body
naturally operates in.

00:33:23.740 --> 00:33:26.200 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: But how does
that language even start,

00:33:26.200 --> 00:33:29.200 align:middle line:84%
because first thing you're going
to have men saying, oh, my god.

00:33:29.200 --> 00:33:32.740 align:middle line:84%
Now we have to know who's on
their period and who's not.

00:33:32.740 --> 00:33:35.080 align:middle line:84%
I mean, you can see everybody
throwing their hands up

00:33:35.080 --> 00:33:39.240 align:middle line:84%
in the air because it's going to
be a messy type of convergence.

00:33:39.240 --> 00:33:40.330 align:middle line:90%
>>OSTERHOFF: Sure.

00:33:40.330 --> 00:33:42.830 align:middle line:84%
It is, while we're
building our awareness.

00:33:42.830 --> 00:33:44.935 align:middle line:84%
So self-awareness is
always step one, right?

00:33:44.935 --> 00:33:45.735 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:33:45.735 --> 00:33:47.710 align:middle line:84%
>>OSTERHOFF: And I work
with major corporations

00:33:47.710 --> 00:33:48.650 align:middle line:90%
around the world.

00:33:48.650 --> 00:33:51.310 align:middle line:84%
And they are actually very
extremely open to this

00:33:51.310 --> 00:33:54.250 align:middle line:84%
because they see
the problem of women

00:33:54.250 --> 00:33:56.120 align:middle line:90%
leaving the workforce by mass.

00:33:56.120 --> 00:33:56.920 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:33:56.920 --> 00:33:58.337 align:middle line:84%
>>OSTERHOFF: They
see the problem.

00:33:58.337 --> 00:34:02.980 align:middle line:84%
This is having major economic
implications for our world.

00:34:02.980 --> 00:34:05.110 align:middle line:84%
Nobody wants this
to happen, right?

00:34:05.110 --> 00:34:07.840 align:middle line:84%
So they're looking for
creative solutions.

00:34:07.840 --> 00:34:10.742 align:middle line:84%
And it's not about
menstrual leave,

00:34:10.742 --> 00:34:12.409 align:middle line:84%
not that I think that
that's a bad idea.

00:34:12.409 --> 00:34:13.451 align:middle line:90%
I think it's a fine idea.

00:34:13.451 --> 00:34:17.469 align:middle line:84%
It's not about us disclosing,
oh, I'm on my period, I'm not.

00:34:17.469 --> 00:34:18.830 align:middle line:90%
That's not what it's about.

00:34:18.830 --> 00:34:22.300 align:middle line:84%
It's about expanding the playing
field to be more inclusive.

00:34:22.300 --> 00:34:24.820 align:middle line:84%
And the biggest
piece, the one tidbit

00:34:24.820 --> 00:34:27.670 align:middle line:84%
that I would say for everyone
that you can start adopting,

00:34:27.670 --> 00:34:29.560 align:middle line:90%
is more flexibility.

00:34:29.560 --> 00:34:31.130 align:middle line:90%
I'll give you one example.

00:34:31.130 --> 00:34:35.139 align:middle line:84%
Let's say that your
goals are oriented

00:34:35.139 --> 00:34:38.139 align:middle line:84%
on a weekly basis at work,
which is typical, right?

00:34:38.139 --> 00:34:41.679 align:middle line:84%
We have these things that we
have to complete every week

00:34:41.679 --> 00:34:44.199 align:middle line:84%
and check the
things off the box.

00:34:44.199 --> 00:34:49.750 align:middle line:84%
Now if we could simply just
expand that to a month view,

00:34:49.750 --> 00:34:53.260 align:middle line:84%
then women could orient
and create their workflow

00:34:53.260 --> 00:34:56.260 align:middle line:84%
to get the same amount of
things done, but in a way

00:34:56.260 --> 00:34:57.880 align:middle line:90%
that works for them.

00:34:57.880 --> 00:35:00.640 align:middle line:84%
Because if we're expected
to operate the same way

00:35:00.640 --> 00:35:03.340 align:middle line:84%
and have the same
output and energy levels

00:35:03.340 --> 00:35:06.700 align:middle line:84%
and focus week after
week after week and day

00:35:06.700 --> 00:35:09.680 align:middle line:84%
after day after day,
it's never going to work.

00:35:09.680 --> 00:35:11.360 align:middle line:84%
And that's why women
are burning out.

00:35:11.360 --> 00:35:14.590 align:middle line:84%
So now if we simply expand
that and we allow women

00:35:14.590 --> 00:35:18.400 align:middle line:84%
the flexibility to adjust
their schedules and workflows

00:35:18.400 --> 00:35:21.940 align:middle line:84%
in alignment with their
biology, with their bodies--

00:35:21.940 --> 00:35:24.700 align:middle line:84%
and the amazing
part is they have

00:35:24.700 --> 00:35:26.770 align:middle line:84%
these different
cognitive gifts that

00:35:26.770 --> 00:35:29.950 align:middle line:84%
come online in different weeks
over the course of the month

00:35:29.950 --> 00:35:32.920 align:middle line:84%
that they could use to be
more productive in their work,

00:35:32.920 --> 00:35:34.690 align:middle line:84%
if they were allowed
to do it and if they

00:35:34.690 --> 00:35:36.170 align:middle line:90%
were taught about it.

00:35:36.170 --> 00:35:38.320 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So then you look
at it in a linear sense.

00:35:38.320 --> 00:35:40.900 align:middle line:84%
And you think, OK, we've
got X number of tasks

00:35:40.900 --> 00:35:42.640 align:middle line:84%
and we have one
month to do them.

00:35:42.640 --> 00:35:44.740 align:middle line:84%
And the man is
consistent and on-task.

00:35:44.740 --> 00:35:46.630 align:middle line:84%
He's ticking off
every day because he's

00:35:46.630 --> 00:35:49.990 align:middle line:84%
dopamine and reward-driven,
dopamine-centered and

00:35:49.990 --> 00:35:51.070 align:middle line:90%
reward-driven.

00:35:51.070 --> 00:35:55.600 align:middle line:84%
OK, so you think, whoa, that's
really unfair because it seems

00:35:55.600 --> 00:35:58.660 align:middle line:84%
to me she's just kind of spaced
out and daydreaming and not

00:35:58.660 --> 00:36:00.280 align:middle line:90%
really showing up right now.

00:36:00.280 --> 00:36:03.850 align:middle line:84%
And yet, there's something
that will carry the female

00:36:03.850 --> 00:36:06.940 align:middle line:84%
through at the end for a
kind of super performance

00:36:06.940 --> 00:36:08.510 align:middle line:90%
when it's all said and done.

00:36:08.510 --> 00:36:13.010 align:middle line:84%
There are these sort
of superinfused moments

00:36:13.010 --> 00:36:16.820 align:middle line:84%
with the feminine that
are kind of superhuman.

00:36:16.820 --> 00:36:18.980 align:middle line:84%
So let's talk about
that and see, just

00:36:18.980 --> 00:36:21.800 align:middle line:84%
so the men don't feel like
it's an unfair burden.

00:36:21.800 --> 00:36:23.900 align:middle line:84%
Let's see how the
woman catches up

00:36:23.900 --> 00:36:25.745 align:middle line:84%
and this all equalizes
in its own way.

00:36:25.745 --> 00:36:26.545 align:middle line:90%
>>OSTERHOFF: Yeah.

00:36:26.545 --> 00:36:29.450 align:middle line:84%
So we have to stop
micromanaging people.

00:36:29.450 --> 00:36:32.780 align:middle line:84%
And we need to
allow them to work

00:36:32.780 --> 00:36:37.160 align:middle line:84%
in a way that is in
alignment with our bodies

00:36:37.160 --> 00:36:38.840 align:middle line:90%
and our natural abilities.

00:36:38.840 --> 00:36:44.600 align:middle line:84%
So during the week that we may
not have as much mental energy

00:36:44.600 --> 00:36:47.570 align:middle line:84%
and focus, we're going
to spin our wheels

00:36:47.570 --> 00:36:49.910 align:middle line:84%
if we're trying to sit down
and do that kind of work.

00:36:49.910 --> 00:36:52.100 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Yeah, just drinking
coffee and feeling depressed.

00:36:52.100 --> 00:36:52.490 align:middle line:90%
>>OSTERHOFF: Yeah.

00:36:52.490 --> 00:36:54.800 align:middle line:84%
And we're not actually
going to be very productive.

00:36:54.800 --> 00:36:59.150 align:middle line:84%
But there are a couple of weeks
during the month where that

00:36:59.150 --> 00:37:02.180 align:middle line:84%
actually is an activity
that would be supportive

00:37:02.180 --> 00:37:04.880 align:middle line:84%
and in alignment with
our neurophysiology.

00:37:04.880 --> 00:37:07.370 align:middle line:84%
And we're going to
get a lot more done.

00:37:07.370 --> 00:37:10.350 align:middle line:84%
We're going to be so much more
productive with those kinds

00:37:10.350 --> 00:37:13.180 align:middle line:90%
of tasks during that time.

00:37:13.180 --> 00:37:16.530 align:middle line:84%
So if we allowed women
to have the flexibility

00:37:16.530 --> 00:37:18.910 align:middle line:84%
and we weren't looking over
their shoulder, saying, wait,

00:37:18.910 --> 00:37:21.670 align:middle line:84%
this week you were too
slow on your productivity,

00:37:21.670 --> 00:37:25.320 align:middle line:84%
if we just allow the
space and allow the trust,

00:37:25.320 --> 00:37:27.420 align:middle line:84%
and we all understand
what the goal

00:37:27.420 --> 00:37:30.810 align:middle line:84%
is at the end of the month, who
cares how we get there, right?

00:37:30.810 --> 00:37:33.810 align:middle line:84%
If men want to work consistently
little by little each day

00:37:33.810 --> 00:37:35.550 align:middle line:90%
to get there, amazing.

00:37:35.550 --> 00:37:37.380 align:middle line:84%
I would actually
recommend that they

00:37:37.380 --> 00:37:40.090 align:middle line:84%
do that because that is in
alignment with their neurology.

00:37:40.090 --> 00:37:40.890 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes, yes.

00:37:40.890 --> 00:37:41.690 align:middle line:90%
Get it done.

00:37:41.690 --> 00:37:44.310 align:middle line:84%
>>OSTERHOFF: And if women
want to rest and gain

00:37:44.310 --> 00:37:48.660 align:middle line:84%
the inspiration and recover
and then hit it hard and work

00:37:48.660 --> 00:37:51.170 align:middle line:84%
longer hours and be super hyper
focused during a certain--

00:37:51.170 --> 00:37:52.920 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And super
creative, because some

00:37:52.920 --> 00:37:55.020 align:middle line:84%
of these portions
of the brain are

00:37:55.020 --> 00:37:56.840 align:middle line:90%
hyper creative in the female.

00:37:56.840 --> 00:37:58.260 align:middle line:90%
>>OSTERHOFF: Yes, exactly.

00:37:58.260 --> 00:38:01.890 align:middle line:84%
Then we're both going to make
it to the same finish line.

00:38:01.890 --> 00:38:05.940 align:middle line:84%
And in fact, female leaders,
when we actually measure this,

00:38:05.940 --> 00:38:08.448 align:middle line:84%
they outperform male
leaders across the board.

00:38:08.448 --> 00:38:09.490 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: It makes sense.

00:38:09.490 --> 00:38:12.600 align:middle line:84%
But the men would argue, because
we're going through these ups

00:38:12.600 --> 00:38:15.780 align:middle line:84%
and downs emotionally, and
also in terms of the way

00:38:15.780 --> 00:38:18.900 align:middle line:84%
our mind is processing,
that we make unfit leaders

00:38:18.900 --> 00:38:21.720 align:middle line:84%
because on any given day,
you can't rely on a woman

00:38:21.720 --> 00:38:24.360 align:middle line:90%
to be very specifically on.

00:38:24.360 --> 00:38:27.000 align:middle line:84%
>>OSTERHOFF: Yes, but
that's because we have

00:38:27.000 --> 00:38:29.370 align:middle line:90%
unfair expectations of women.

00:38:29.370 --> 00:38:31.890 align:middle line:84%
We have set a consistent
bar, and we said,

00:38:31.890 --> 00:38:34.110 align:middle line:84%
you have to meet this
every single day.

00:38:34.110 --> 00:38:38.970 align:middle line:84%
Not only that, but we've set a
male-centric model for society

00:38:38.970 --> 00:38:41.200 align:middle line:90%
and how success looks.

00:38:41.200 --> 00:38:44.580 align:middle line:84%
And again, because we're using
this male-centric model, that

00:38:44.580 --> 00:38:48.730 align:middle line:84%
is what we are understanding
is important in society.

00:38:48.730 --> 00:38:51.000 align:middle line:84%
So when we start to
shift that, we're

00:38:51.000 --> 00:38:54.840 align:middle line:84%
going to see that some of the
issues that we're experiencing

00:38:54.840 --> 00:38:58.170 align:middle line:84%
across the world
can be solved when

00:38:58.170 --> 00:39:01.470 align:middle line:84%
we start to elevate the
other half of the population

00:39:01.470 --> 00:39:04.920 align:middle line:84%
and bring them up to the
level and level of importance

00:39:04.920 --> 00:39:09.420 align:middle line:84%
and level of normalcy
as the male model.

00:39:09.420 --> 00:39:12.075 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So it starts at
home with our children.

00:39:12.075 --> 00:39:12.950 align:middle line:90%
>>OSTERHOFF: It does.

00:39:12.950 --> 00:39:15.390 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: So we have, say a boy.

00:39:15.390 --> 00:39:16.370 align:middle line:90%
And we have a girl.

00:39:16.370 --> 00:39:18.410 align:middle line:90%
And the boy is on it.

00:39:18.410 --> 00:39:19.565 align:middle line:90%
He has all his skills.

00:39:19.565 --> 00:39:21.440 align:middle line:84%
I think I've written
them all down, his motor

00:39:21.440 --> 00:39:24.770 align:middle line:84%
skills, his mathematical
reasoning, his working memory,

00:39:24.770 --> 00:39:27.380 align:middle line:84%
his pattern recognition, all
these very strong male traits.

00:39:27.380 --> 00:39:29.060 align:middle line:90%
He's going, going, going.

00:39:29.060 --> 00:39:31.130 align:middle line:84%
And the girl is
dragging herself.

00:39:31.130 --> 00:39:33.800 align:middle line:84%
And then she comes up with
some brilliant, off-the-wall

00:39:33.800 --> 00:39:35.270 align:middle line:90%
solution to something.

00:39:35.270 --> 00:39:39.980 align:middle line:84%
How do parents best start
accommodating for this in home

00:39:39.980 --> 00:39:43.340 align:middle line:84%
when they both have their
tests due the same day?

00:39:43.340 --> 00:39:46.550 align:middle line:84%
They both have to
graduate in the same year.

00:39:46.550 --> 00:39:48.740 align:middle line:84%
>>OSTERHOFF: It's the
same solution, I think,

00:39:48.740 --> 00:39:52.550 align:middle line:84%
in the corporate space and for
our world's economy, which is,

00:39:52.550 --> 00:39:56.540 align:middle line:84%
we want to expand the
expectations and the playing

00:39:56.540 --> 00:40:00.180 align:middle line:84%
field to be more inclusive
of the little girls

00:40:00.180 --> 00:40:02.090 align:middle line:84%
and the different way
that they operate.

00:40:02.090 --> 00:40:05.540 align:middle line:84%
Even the way that we do
our K-12 education is

00:40:05.540 --> 00:40:07.400 align:middle line:90%
based around the male model.

00:40:07.400 --> 00:40:10.070 align:middle line:84%
Sit at the desk for
five straight hours

00:40:10.070 --> 00:40:13.920 align:middle line:84%
and do subject after subject
after subject, right?

00:40:13.920 --> 00:40:16.090 align:middle line:84%
And I don't really think
that works for any human,

00:40:16.090 --> 00:40:16.890 align:middle line:90%
to be honest.

00:40:16.890 --> 00:40:19.720 align:middle line:84%
I don't think it works
for men or women.

00:40:19.720 --> 00:40:23.640 align:middle line:84%
But it is more aligned
with the capacities

00:40:23.640 --> 00:40:27.520 align:middle line:90%
of the male neurophysiology.

00:40:27.520 --> 00:40:31.230 align:middle line:84%
So parents can start to
understand that there are

00:40:31.230 --> 00:40:33.300 align:middle line:90%
differences and that that's OK.

00:40:33.300 --> 00:40:36.930 align:middle line:84%
And what I would suggest is
to celebrate the differences.

00:40:36.930 --> 00:40:39.780 align:middle line:84%
When you see your
little boys are

00:40:39.780 --> 00:40:42.600 align:middle line:84%
more interested
in activities that

00:40:42.600 --> 00:40:45.570 align:middle line:84%
might be related
to dopamine, you

00:40:45.570 --> 00:40:47.430 align:middle line:84%
can celebrate that
and honor that.

00:40:47.430 --> 00:40:49.440 align:middle line:84%
When you see our
little girls are

00:40:49.440 --> 00:40:54.840 align:middle line:84%
more interested in connection
and creating stories

00:40:54.840 --> 00:40:58.680 align:middle line:84%
about their dolls that are
also really important for them

00:40:58.680 --> 00:41:02.430 align:middle line:84%
to understand society and how
it works, we celebrate that.

00:41:02.430 --> 00:41:04.350 align:middle line:84%
And we don't make
it lesser than.

00:41:04.350 --> 00:41:07.120 align:middle line:84%
One is not better or
lesser than the other.

00:41:07.120 --> 00:41:09.310 align:middle line:84%
They're both
extremely important.

00:41:09.310 --> 00:41:11.150 align:middle line:84%
They're just different
paths, again,

00:41:11.150 --> 00:41:12.330 align:middle line:90%
to get to the same place.

00:41:12.330 --> 00:41:14.372 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So what would
you say to a mother who's

00:41:14.372 --> 00:41:16.370 align:middle line:84%
maybe a little bit
of a helicopter mom

00:41:16.370 --> 00:41:18.545 align:middle line:84%
and wants her kids to
do well and score high,

00:41:18.545 --> 00:41:20.420 align:middle line:84%
and has all kinds of
after-school activities,

00:41:20.420 --> 00:41:22.010 align:middle line:90%
and the girl is dragging?

00:41:22.010 --> 00:41:24.320 align:middle line:84%
She's not-- she's
in her low phase.

00:41:24.320 --> 00:41:26.180 align:middle line:84%
What would you
say to these moms?

00:41:26.180 --> 00:41:29.120 align:middle line:84%
>>OSTERHOFF: Well again,
remember, it's just a phase.

00:41:29.120 --> 00:41:32.300 align:middle line:84%
And it's going to be
over in less than a week.

00:41:32.300 --> 00:41:35.360 align:middle line:84%
So maybe what we
could do and say,

00:41:35.360 --> 00:41:37.822 align:middle line:84%
I know you're feeling a little
less energized right now.

00:41:37.822 --> 00:41:39.530 align:middle line:84%
And I'm going to go
ahead and honor that.

00:41:39.530 --> 00:41:41.780 align:middle line:84%
We're going to allow
you to get more rest.

00:41:41.780 --> 00:41:45.110 align:middle line:84%
I'm not going to push you
to do all of these tasks

00:41:45.110 --> 00:41:46.278 align:middle line:90%
that you need to do.

00:41:46.278 --> 00:41:47.570 align:middle line:90%
I'm going to allow you to rest.

00:41:47.570 --> 00:41:51.080 align:middle line:84%
And also, know
that next week when

00:41:51.080 --> 00:41:52.910 align:middle line:84%
I know you're
feeling better and I

00:41:52.910 --> 00:41:54.920 align:middle line:84%
know you have more
energy and more focus

00:41:54.920 --> 00:41:57.230 align:middle line:84%
and more capacity for
this type of work,

00:41:57.230 --> 00:41:58.993 align:middle line:84%
we're going to do
a little extra.

00:41:58.993 --> 00:42:00.410 align:middle line:84%
We're going to do
a couple-- we're

00:42:00.410 --> 00:42:03.320 align:middle line:84%
going to do two hours of
homework instead of one.

00:42:03.320 --> 00:42:05.180 align:middle line:84%
And I'm going to
help you through.

00:42:05.180 --> 00:42:07.130 align:middle line:84%
And we're going to learn
how to navigate this.

00:42:07.130 --> 00:42:09.020 align:middle line:90%
That would be ideal.

00:42:09.020 --> 00:42:11.070 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: That's so intelligent.

00:42:11.070 --> 00:42:12.420 align:middle line:90%
And so not being done.

00:42:12.420 --> 00:42:13.800 align:middle line:90%
You used to work for the CDC.

00:42:13.800 --> 00:42:14.220 align:middle line:90%
>>OSTERHOFF: Yeah.

00:42:14.220 --> 00:42:16.140 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And so you
started seeing-- you saw

00:42:16.140 --> 00:42:17.670 align:middle line:90%
all these patterns playing out.

00:42:17.670 --> 00:42:20.040 align:middle line:90%
And you saw all the burnout.

00:42:20.040 --> 00:42:24.240 align:middle line:84%
And at what rate-- we talked
about this a little last time.

00:42:24.240 --> 00:42:26.550 align:middle line:90%
I'd like to know now.

00:42:26.550 --> 00:42:29.460 align:middle line:84%
What kind of rate are you
seeing of female burnout

00:42:29.460 --> 00:42:33.570 align:middle line:84%
in the workplace,
and at what ages?

00:42:33.570 --> 00:42:37.230 align:middle line:84%
>>OSTERHOFF: It's every
age, to be honest.

00:42:37.230 --> 00:42:41.790 align:middle line:84%
Our female leaders
are really reporting

00:42:41.790 --> 00:42:44.190 align:middle line:90%
this across the globe.

00:42:44.190 --> 00:42:46.860 align:middle line:84%
The most public
example of this, you

00:42:46.860 --> 00:42:49.110 align:middle line:84%
might remember from
January of this year,

00:42:49.110 --> 00:42:51.420 align:middle line:84%
was when Jacinda
Ardern stepped down

00:42:51.420 --> 00:42:53.040 align:middle line:84%
as prime minister
of New Zealand.

00:42:53.040 --> 00:42:54.165 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes, New Zealand.

00:42:54.165 --> 00:42:55.870 align:middle line:84%
>>OSTERHOFF: And
what she said was,

00:42:55.870 --> 00:42:58.260 align:middle line:84%
"I have no gas
left in the tank."

00:42:58.260 --> 00:43:00.630 align:middle line:84%
And the reason
why is because she

00:43:00.630 --> 00:43:04.140 align:middle line:84%
had these male-centric
expectations and environment,

00:43:04.140 --> 00:43:07.290 align:middle line:84%
this playing field to work
within that was so limiting

00:43:07.290 --> 00:43:12.450 align:middle line:84%
and not in alignment with her
natural gifts and rhythms.

00:43:12.450 --> 00:43:15.940 align:middle line:84%
And then the BBC had the
audacity to ask the question,

00:43:15.940 --> 00:43:18.360 align:middle line:84%
well, can women actually
have it all, then?

00:43:18.360 --> 00:43:20.580 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right, I remember.

00:43:20.580 --> 00:43:23.280 align:middle line:10%
>>OSTERHOFF: And
the answer is no,

00:43:23.280 --> 00:43:27.720 align:middle line:10%
not if we continue to have
the same expectations of what

00:43:27.720 --> 00:43:29.970 align:middle line:10%
success is.

00:43:29.970 --> 00:43:36.390 align:middle line:84%
So I think what we need to do is
we need to understand that what

00:43:36.390 --> 00:43:39.450 align:middle line:84%
is contributing to these
excessive burnout rates, which

00:43:39.450 --> 00:43:44.223 align:middle line:84%
is more than 200%
higher in women than men

00:43:44.223 --> 00:43:45.640 align:middle line:84%
across the board
in the workplace.

00:43:45.640 --> 00:43:46.950 align:middle line:90%
And this isn't just in the US.

00:43:46.950 --> 00:43:48.840 align:middle line:10%
This is in the UK, Canada.

00:43:48.840 --> 00:43:51.010 align:middle line:10%
I'm doing a lot of projects
in other countries.

00:43:51.010 --> 00:43:53.130 align:middle line:84%
And we're finding
the same thing is

00:43:53.130 --> 00:43:56.400 align:middle line:84%
being reported from the women
in the corporate structure.

00:43:56.400 --> 00:44:00.780 align:middle line:84%
So we really need to
take a look at why.

00:44:00.780 --> 00:44:03.510 align:middle line:90%
What is the underlying issue?

00:44:03.510 --> 00:44:06.600 align:middle line:84%
And the solution isn't
just plop more women

00:44:06.600 --> 00:44:08.940 align:middle line:90%
into leadership positions.

00:44:08.940 --> 00:44:10.790 align:middle line:84%
That's just fixing the
numbers temporarily.

00:44:10.790 --> 00:44:13.290 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Right, the perception,
really, more than anything.

00:44:13.290 --> 00:44:13.650 align:middle line:90%
>>OSTERHOFF: Yes.

00:44:13.650 --> 00:44:15.240 align:middle line:84%
That's not doing it,
because guess what?

00:44:15.240 --> 00:44:17.198 align:middle line:84%
We're going to plop women
into these leadership

00:44:17.198 --> 00:44:20.310 align:middle line:84%
positions in a
male-centric environment,

00:44:20.310 --> 00:44:23.430 align:middle line:84%
and they're still going to
burn out because it's not

00:44:23.430 --> 00:44:25.170 align:middle line:90%
set up for them.

00:44:25.170 --> 00:44:27.120 align:middle line:84%
It's not set up
an acknowledgment

00:44:27.120 --> 00:44:30.500 align:middle line:84%
of their unique capacities,
needs, and skills.

00:44:30.500 --> 00:44:31.300 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:44:31.300 --> 00:44:33.700 align:middle line:84%
And your work is really--
that's what you're covering,

00:44:33.700 --> 00:44:37.060 align:middle line:84%
that you're looking
at these female cycles

00:44:37.060 --> 00:44:39.490 align:middle line:84%
so that we can see how
this starts plugging in

00:44:39.490 --> 00:44:42.550 align:middle line:84%
and where we give this
grace of time and space

00:44:42.550 --> 00:44:45.280 align:middle line:84%
to women so that we can
have the gift of all

00:44:45.280 --> 00:44:49.340 align:middle line:84%
those other incredible
mental capabilities,

00:44:49.340 --> 00:44:53.170 align:middle line:84%
including super high creativity
to whatever solutions are

00:44:53.170 --> 00:44:55.130 align:middle line:90%
being needed on a global scale.

00:44:55.130 --> 00:44:59.122 align:middle line:84%
So again, congratulations on
all the work you're doing.

00:44:59.122 --> 00:45:00.205 align:middle line:90%
And you're just beginning.

00:45:00.205 --> 00:45:01.163 align:middle line:90%
>>OSTERHOFF: Thank you.

00:45:01.163 --> 00:45:03.850 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So any final thoughts
before we sign off here?

00:45:03.850 --> 00:45:05.410 align:middle line:84%
We've covered quite
a bit and a lot.

00:45:05.410 --> 00:45:08.260 align:middle line:84%
And I thank you for the
kind of functional advice.

00:45:08.260 --> 00:45:09.160 align:middle line:90%
>>OSTERHOFF: Yeah.

00:45:09.160 --> 00:45:10.490 align:middle line:90%
Well, thank you for having me.

00:45:10.490 --> 00:45:12.140 align:middle line:90%
This is so important.

00:45:12.140 --> 00:45:14.920 align:middle line:84%
And I want everyone
who is watching,

00:45:14.920 --> 00:45:17.590 align:middle line:84%
whether you're a
male or a female,

00:45:17.590 --> 00:45:22.010 align:middle line:84%
to just understand
that across the globe,

00:45:22.010 --> 00:45:26.200 align:middle line:84%
we're really disconnected from
nature and the natural phases

00:45:26.200 --> 00:45:28.360 align:middle line:90%
and cycles and rhythms.

00:45:28.360 --> 00:45:31.630 align:middle line:84%
And one way that we can
connect back in with nature

00:45:31.630 --> 00:45:35.830 align:middle line:84%
is by connecting back in with
the natural rhythms of nature,

00:45:35.830 --> 00:45:38.320 align:middle line:84%
the natural rhythms
of plants and animals,

00:45:38.320 --> 00:45:41.380 align:middle line:84%
and the natural biological
rhythms of women

00:45:41.380 --> 00:45:45.730 align:middle line:84%
that have been ignored and
suppressed for so long.

00:45:45.730 --> 00:45:48.760 align:middle line:84%
If we can all start to
acknowledge that and think

00:45:48.760 --> 00:45:51.760 align:middle line:84%
about how that
impacts how we operate

00:45:51.760 --> 00:45:55.340 align:middle line:84%
and how we relate to one another
and how we support one another,

00:45:55.340 --> 00:45:57.918 align:middle line:84%
then we can really make a
sustainable change, I think.

00:45:57.918 --> 00:45:59.710 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And when you
look at it that way,

00:45:59.710 --> 00:46:00.910 align:middle line:90%
it's actually magical.

00:46:00.910 --> 00:46:02.770 align:middle line:90%
>>OSTERHOFF: It is magical, yes.

00:46:02.770 --> 00:46:04.252 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Kayla,
thank you so much.

00:46:04.252 --> 00:46:05.210 align:middle line:90%
>>OSTERHOFF: Thank you.

00:46:05.210 --> 00:46:07.240 align:middle line:10%
>>REGINA: This is exciting
work, so necessary

00:46:07.240 --> 00:46:10.120 align:middle line:10%
that we begin to incorporate
these traits and gifts

00:46:10.120 --> 00:46:13.360 align:middle line:10%
side by side for the creation
of the new world we all

00:46:13.360 --> 00:46:14.950 align:middle line:10%
want to be giving birth to now.

00:46:14.950 --> 00:46:16.790 align:middle line:84%
We simply can't do it
the old way anymore.

00:46:16.790 --> 00:46:17.590 align:middle line:90%
It's not working.

00:46:17.590 --> 00:46:18.715 align:middle line:90%
The systems aren't working.

00:46:18.715 --> 00:46:19.700 align:middle line:90%
None of it's working.

00:46:19.700 --> 00:46:22.150 align:middle line:84%
So we have to start from the
ground up beginning at home.

00:46:22.150 --> 00:46:26.650 align:middle line:84%
