00:00:27.490 --> 00:00:30.160 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA MEREDITH: Ivan Rados
began his life as an artist.

00:00:30.160 --> 00:00:32.740 align:middle line:10%
But as with many
artists, he also

00:00:32.740 --> 00:00:34.580 align:middle line:10%
was an empath and intuitive.

00:00:34.580 --> 00:00:38.940 align:middle line:84%
This is the path to the great
art, that openness to what is.

00:00:38.940 --> 00:00:41.530 align:middle line:84%
The path of discovery
begins with understanding

00:00:41.530 --> 00:00:42.510 align:middle line:90%
consciousness.

00:00:42.510 --> 00:00:44.230 align:middle line:84%
As Ivan describes
it, consciousness

00:00:44.230 --> 00:00:47.420 align:middle line:84%
is both conscious of and
impartial to the activity

00:00:47.420 --> 00:00:48.280 align:middle line:90%
of the mind.

00:00:48.280 --> 00:00:50.550 align:middle line:84%
Even when it's wreaking
havoc on our lives,

00:00:50.550 --> 00:00:52.890 align:middle line:84%
it has the immense
power of creation.

00:00:52.890 --> 00:00:54.850 align:middle line:84%
Ivan is with us to
talk about finding

00:00:54.850 --> 00:00:57.370 align:middle line:84%
our own truth, a tall
order while living

00:00:57.370 --> 00:01:00.680 align:middle line:84%
among perpetual messaging
in our daily lives.

00:01:00.680 --> 00:01:02.940 align:middle line:84%
And we're going to talk
about that in a little bit.

00:01:02.940 --> 00:01:05.410 align:middle line:84%
I mean, disturbing
how much messaging

00:01:05.410 --> 00:01:08.330 align:middle line:84%
is hitting every
human being per day,

00:01:08.330 --> 00:01:10.900 align:middle line:84%
unless you're living in
the Outback somewhere.

00:01:10.900 --> 00:01:13.140 align:middle line:84%
>>IVAN RADOS: Yeah, the
most disturbing message

00:01:13.140 --> 00:01:16.670 align:middle line:84%
you can send or give to
people is to tell them

00:01:16.670 --> 00:01:18.600 align:middle line:90%
you are not your mind.

00:01:18.600 --> 00:01:20.360 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Interesting.

00:01:20.360 --> 00:01:23.530 align:middle line:84%
>>RADOS: Because then
people will defend that.

00:01:23.530 --> 00:01:25.760 align:middle line:84%
Because when they are
defending the mind,

00:01:25.760 --> 00:01:27.760 align:middle line:84%
they are defending
their attachment

00:01:27.760 --> 00:01:30.827 align:middle line:84%
to society rules and
norms, conditions.

00:01:30.827 --> 00:01:31.410 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:01:31.410 --> 00:01:31.909 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:01:31.909 --> 00:01:34.642 align:middle line:84%
We're going to go way deep
into that in a little bit.

00:01:34.642 --> 00:01:37.100 align:middle line:84%
First I wanted to let people
know who you are a little bit.

00:01:37.100 --> 00:01:39.100 align:middle line:84%
I mean, you're really
a world famous artist.

00:01:39.100 --> 00:01:41.370 align:middle line:84%
You've had a very
successful career

00:01:41.370 --> 00:01:44.600 align:middle line:90%
as an artist, modern era.

00:01:44.600 --> 00:01:47.170 align:middle line:84%
You've been featured in
the Tate Museum in London.

00:01:47.170 --> 00:01:49.920 align:middle line:84%
And with the work you're
doing now is absolutely divine

00:01:49.920 --> 00:01:52.370 align:middle line:84%
because it's speaking to
us in another language,

00:01:52.370 --> 00:01:55.380 align:middle line:84%
your language, which
is sacred geometry.

00:01:55.380 --> 00:01:57.520 align:middle line:84%
And sacred geometry,
as it's shown

00:01:57.520 --> 00:02:01.150 align:middle line:84%
through your beautiful
yantra work, which we'll show

00:02:01.150 --> 00:02:02.960 align:middle line:90%
throughout our conversation.

00:02:02.960 --> 00:02:06.530 align:middle line:84%
So let's talk a little bit about
your early life and career,

00:02:06.530 --> 00:02:09.000 align:middle line:84%
and then ultimately,
how you segued

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:10.687 align:middle line:90%
into what you're doing now.

00:02:10.687 --> 00:02:11.770 align:middle line:90%
>>RADOS: Oh, that's tough.

00:02:11.770 --> 00:02:12.490 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHS]

00:02:12.490 --> 00:02:13.198 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Oh, no.

00:02:13.198 --> 00:02:13.930 align:middle line:10%
We have an hour.

00:02:13.930 --> 00:02:15.600 align:middle line:10%
Just tell us your life story.

00:02:15.600 --> 00:02:18.200 align:middle line:10%
>>RADOS: I'd rather give
this task to someone else

00:02:18.200 --> 00:02:21.240 align:middle line:10%
to talk about my past than
me talking about my past

00:02:21.240 --> 00:02:24.360 align:middle line:10%
because that past is gone.

00:02:24.360 --> 00:02:25.260 align:middle line:10%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:02:25.260 --> 00:02:27.610 align:middle line:10%
>>RADOS: Certain memories
are left, you know?

00:02:27.610 --> 00:02:33.700 align:middle line:84%
But thanks to the question,
I can revive some memories

00:02:33.700 --> 00:02:35.599 align:middle line:84%
and open my mind
to talk about it.

00:02:35.599 --> 00:02:36.140 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: OK.

00:02:36.140 --> 00:02:36.770 align:middle line:90%
I would appreciate it.

00:02:36.770 --> 00:02:38.478 align:middle line:84%
>>RADOS: In order to
reference something,

00:02:38.478 --> 00:02:43.380 align:middle line:84%
in order to point at
something, which is useful.

00:02:43.380 --> 00:02:47.014 align:middle line:84%
Which can be useful,
which can be helpful.

00:02:47.014 --> 00:02:47.930 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes, it can.

00:02:47.930 --> 00:02:48.710 align:middle line:90%
>>RADOS: Yes.

00:02:48.710 --> 00:02:53.380 align:middle line:84%
So I was born--
actually, my body

00:02:53.380 --> 00:02:55.700 align:middle line:90%
was born in former Yugoslavia.

00:02:55.700 --> 00:02:57.660 align:middle line:84%
And I have a
relationship with my body

00:02:57.660 --> 00:03:02.070 align:middle line:84%
but not with the place
where my body was born.

00:03:02.070 --> 00:03:07.850 align:middle line:84%
So my body was born there in
the family of alcoholic father

00:03:07.850 --> 00:03:12.230 align:middle line:84%
and Catholic-- orthodox
Catholic devoted mother.

00:03:12.230 --> 00:03:13.460 align:middle line:90%
So in that--

00:03:13.460 --> 00:03:14.270 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Wow.

00:03:14.270 --> 00:03:17.810 align:middle line:84%
>>RADOS: --that dynamic of
causes and consequences,

00:03:17.810 --> 00:03:20.220 align:middle line:84%
my father would come drunk,
my mother would complain,

00:03:20.220 --> 00:03:22.362 align:middle line:84%
my father would yell,
my mother would--

00:03:22.362 --> 00:03:23.070 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Preach?

00:03:23.070 --> 00:03:23.750 align:middle line:90%
>>RADOS: Preach.

00:03:23.750 --> 00:03:28.310 align:middle line:84%
And then me and my sister
would be punished at the end.

00:03:28.310 --> 00:03:31.640 align:middle line:84%
So my mother would say, I'm
doing all of that for you.

00:03:31.640 --> 00:03:32.940 align:middle line:90%
I love you.

00:03:32.940 --> 00:03:38.880 align:middle line:84%
So I grew up in the atmosphere
of a very dysfunctional family.

00:03:38.880 --> 00:03:44.670 align:middle line:84%
And in a way-- in a way I
knew that I chose that family

00:03:44.670 --> 00:03:46.770 align:middle line:90%
for a particular reason.

00:03:46.770 --> 00:03:55.050 align:middle line:84%
In a way, I respected their
wish to be there not for me,

00:03:55.050 --> 00:03:58.780 align:middle line:84%
but to be there for
something greater and more

00:03:58.780 --> 00:04:04.530 align:middle line:84%
powerful than what life is
providing at the moment.

00:04:04.530 --> 00:04:09.740 align:middle line:84%
Some abstract ideas, some
beliefs, dysfunctionality,

00:04:09.740 --> 00:04:11.740 align:middle line:90%
fantasies, dreams.

00:04:11.740 --> 00:04:16.010 align:middle line:84%
My father had the dream
to go away from the town

00:04:16.010 --> 00:04:17.209 align:middle line:90%
and live somewhere else.

00:04:17.209 --> 00:04:19.750 align:middle line:84%
My father wanted to achieve
heaven, attain heaven.

00:04:19.750 --> 00:04:23.650 align:middle line:84%
So they would clash then-- us
kids, me and sister would be

00:04:23.650 --> 00:04:24.980 align:middle line:90%
[INAUDIBLE].

00:04:24.980 --> 00:04:29.990 align:middle line:84%
So very manipulative
way of existing.

00:04:29.990 --> 00:04:31.890 align:middle line:90%
And I wanted to go out.

00:04:31.890 --> 00:04:35.560 align:middle line:84%
Not out of my family,
but out of that imprint,

00:04:35.560 --> 00:04:38.100 align:middle line:90%
out of that possibility.

00:04:38.100 --> 00:04:40.780 align:middle line:84%
My son was born in
'97, called Kai.

00:04:40.780 --> 00:04:44.380 align:middle line:84%
And my father called me
and said, oh, thanks God.

00:04:44.380 --> 00:04:47.340 align:middle line:84%
You have a son, so
you can continue

00:04:47.340 --> 00:04:49.500 align:middle line:90%
tradition of the Rados family.

00:04:49.500 --> 00:04:51.780 align:middle line:90%
And I said, what tradition?

00:04:51.780 --> 00:04:55.450 align:middle line:84%
Tradition of bullying,
tradition of not listening?

00:04:55.450 --> 00:04:59.630 align:middle line:90%
Tradition of not being there?

00:04:59.630 --> 00:05:00.490 align:middle line:90%
Not loving?

00:05:00.490 --> 00:05:01.597 align:middle line:90%
Not supporting?

00:05:01.597 --> 00:05:02.555 align:middle line:90%
That kind of tradition?

00:05:02.555 --> 00:05:04.610 align:middle line:90%
I don't want that tradition.

00:05:04.610 --> 00:05:06.370 align:middle line:84%
I'm going to destroy
all the traditions.

00:05:06.370 --> 00:05:12.990 align:middle line:84%
And that was the beginning of
my deeper search to find myself.

00:05:12.990 --> 00:05:16.560 align:middle line:84%
So but before that, I had
glimpses of, I want to go out.

00:05:16.560 --> 00:05:18.090 align:middle line:90%
I wanted to find my way.

00:05:18.090 --> 00:05:19.560 align:middle line:90%
I wanted to find myself.

00:05:19.560 --> 00:05:22.800 align:middle line:90%
So I asked my grandma.

00:05:22.800 --> 00:05:24.210 align:middle line:90%
She was a very wise one.

00:05:24.210 --> 00:05:29.260 align:middle line:84%
I said, Grandma--
yeah, but I forgot

00:05:29.260 --> 00:05:33.210 align:middle line:84%
to tell you that
before that, I used

00:05:33.210 --> 00:05:36.000 align:middle line:84%
to touch people,
kids in the school,

00:05:36.000 --> 00:05:39.310 align:middle line:84%
touching them if
they had any problem.

00:05:39.310 --> 00:05:42.010 align:middle line:90%
Sort of like compassion.

00:05:42.010 --> 00:05:44.270 align:middle line:84%
In a way, you came to
predict as empathy.

00:05:44.270 --> 00:05:45.510 align:middle line:90%
But I didn't know that.

00:05:45.510 --> 00:05:48.940 align:middle line:84%
So touching them, and they
would be healthy again.

00:05:48.940 --> 00:05:50.140 align:middle line:90%
Stomachache, headache.

00:05:50.140 --> 00:05:52.770 align:middle line:90%
So kids used to come, you know?

00:05:52.770 --> 00:05:56.520 align:middle line:90%
Age seven, eight, nine.

00:05:56.520 --> 00:05:57.980 align:middle line:84%
And said, oh, I
have a toothache.

00:05:57.980 --> 00:05:59.440 align:middle line:90%
Can you help me?

00:05:59.440 --> 00:06:02.450 align:middle line:84%
So my principal
called my mother.

00:06:02.450 --> 00:06:05.530 align:middle line:84%
And my mother was really
furious and said, what are you

00:06:05.530 --> 00:06:07.610 align:middle line:90%
doing there, you know?

00:06:07.610 --> 00:06:09.300 align:middle line:90%
You have to stop doing that.

00:06:09.300 --> 00:06:11.540 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Why was she so
afraid of what you did?

00:06:11.540 --> 00:06:14.554 align:middle line:84%
>>RADOS: Because of being
judged by other people.

00:06:14.554 --> 00:06:15.220 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: I see.

00:06:15.220 --> 00:06:15.740 align:middle line:90%
>>RADOS: You see?

00:06:15.740 --> 00:06:16.530 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: I see.

00:06:16.530 --> 00:06:18.380 align:middle line:84%
>>RADOS: Society's
controlling you

00:06:18.380 --> 00:06:21.310 align:middle line:84%
by you giving your
responsibility to society.

00:06:21.310 --> 00:06:24.710 align:middle line:84%
So society will tell you who
you are, what you have to be,

00:06:24.710 --> 00:06:26.120 align:middle line:90%
where you have to go.

00:06:26.120 --> 00:06:31.580 align:middle line:84%
And so anyway, I asked my
grandma, and my grandma said,

00:06:31.580 --> 00:06:32.790 align:middle line:90%
you have that talent.

00:06:32.790 --> 00:06:39.115 align:middle line:84%
You have the energy inside of
you to be great with yourself.

00:06:39.115 --> 00:06:41.470 align:middle line:90%
And so you can be a healer.

00:06:41.470 --> 00:06:43.990 align:middle line:84%
But people will
not understand you.

00:06:43.990 --> 00:06:46.920 align:middle line:84%
And you will clash with
principal, and then later

00:06:46.920 --> 00:06:51.590 align:middle line:84%
on with other people
as you grow up.

00:06:51.590 --> 00:06:53.140 align:middle line:90%
So it's better to channel that.

00:06:53.140 --> 00:06:54.530 align:middle line:90%
How to channel that?

00:06:54.530 --> 00:06:57.545 align:middle line:90%
And she said, go into art.

00:06:57.545 --> 00:06:58.790 align:middle line:90%
And I said, yeah.

00:06:58.790 --> 00:06:59.600 align:middle line:90%
I can do that.

00:06:59.600 --> 00:07:02.080 align:middle line:84%
I can channel that
energy into art.

00:07:02.080 --> 00:07:04.890 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Sounds like your
grandma was a wise person.

00:07:04.890 --> 00:07:07.590 align:middle line:84%
Was she also a healer
or an intuitive?

00:07:07.590 --> 00:07:11.540 align:middle line:84%
>>RADOS: In to herbs-- like
I remember twisting my ankle.

00:07:11.540 --> 00:07:17.455 align:middle line:84%
As you would come and cut
onion in half and salt

00:07:17.455 --> 00:07:22.140 align:middle line:84%
it with sea salt. And she would
put that on my ankle, and ankle

00:07:22.140 --> 00:07:25.590 align:middle line:84%
would be healed in less
than an hour or two.

00:07:25.590 --> 00:07:26.320 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: No.

00:07:26.320 --> 00:07:26.630 align:middle line:90%
>>RADOS: Yeah.

00:07:26.630 --> 00:07:27.030 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Really.

00:07:27.030 --> 00:07:27.779 align:middle line:90%
>>RADOS: Try that.

00:07:27.779 --> 00:07:28.390 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHS]

00:07:28.390 --> 00:07:29.980 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Oh, you
just get-- lovely.

00:07:29.980 --> 00:07:30.480 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:07:30.480 --> 00:07:34.422 align:middle line:84%
So cut onion, put sea salt
on it, then put it on wound.

00:07:34.422 --> 00:07:35.630 align:middle line:90%
>>RADOS: Put it on the wound.

00:07:35.630 --> 00:07:36.421 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: OK, good.

00:07:36.421 --> 00:07:36.980 align:middle line:90%
Thank you.

00:07:36.980 --> 00:07:38.390 align:middle line:90%
>>RADOS: But it can be painful.

00:07:38.390 --> 00:07:39.190 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: I bet it can.

00:07:39.190 --> 00:07:40.480 align:middle line:84%
>>RADOS: But you have
to go through the pain.

00:07:40.480 --> 00:07:41.330 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah, it'll burn.

00:07:41.330 --> 00:07:41.860 align:middle line:90%
Interesting.

00:07:41.860 --> 00:07:42.090 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:07:42.090 --> 00:07:42.500 align:middle line:90%
Go ahead.

00:07:42.500 --> 00:07:42.999 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

00:07:42.999 --> 00:07:46.045 align:middle line:84%
>>RADOS: And I went
into art, studied art.

00:07:46.045 --> 00:07:48.680 align:middle line:90%


00:07:48.680 --> 00:07:50.680 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Was this
available to you,

00:07:50.680 --> 00:07:55.117 align:middle line:84%
or was this something that was
promoted by the school as well?

00:07:55.117 --> 00:07:55.950 align:middle line:90%
>>RADOS: No, no, no.

00:07:55.950 --> 00:07:57.020 align:middle line:90%
It was my own decision.

00:07:57.020 --> 00:07:58.070 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: OK.

00:07:58.070 --> 00:08:00.670 align:middle line:84%
>>RADOS: I decided, I'm
going to be an artist.

00:08:00.670 --> 00:08:04.480 align:middle line:84%
So at the time I
decided to be an artist,

00:08:04.480 --> 00:08:06.770 align:middle line:84%
I was already
involved in acting.

00:08:06.770 --> 00:08:09.300 align:middle line:90%
I was acting in theater.

00:08:09.300 --> 00:08:10.520 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: How old were you?

00:08:10.520 --> 00:08:11.942 align:middle line:90%
>>RADOS: I was 17.

00:08:11.942 --> 00:08:12.650 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: 17, OK.

00:08:12.650 --> 00:08:13.200 align:middle line:90%
>>RADOS: 16.

00:08:13.200 --> 00:08:14.220 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Had you
already exhibited

00:08:14.220 --> 00:08:15.280 align:middle line:90%
some artistic ability?

00:08:15.280 --> 00:08:16.590 align:middle line:90%
>>RADOS: No.

00:08:16.590 --> 00:08:20.360 align:middle line:90%
Age 19, I exhibited in Sarajevo.

00:08:20.360 --> 00:08:22.750 align:middle line:90%
My first exhibition.

00:08:22.750 --> 00:08:24.250 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: And you started at 17?

00:08:24.250 --> 00:08:25.910 align:middle line:84%
You've discovered
yourself at 17.

00:08:25.910 --> 00:08:26.959 align:middle line:90%
So this was latent.

00:08:26.959 --> 00:08:27.500 align:middle line:90%
>>RADOS: Yes.

00:08:27.500 --> 00:08:28.083 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:08:28.083 --> 00:08:33.330 align:middle line:84%
>>RADOS: So by the way, age
15, I've lifted my astral body.

00:08:33.330 --> 00:08:34.850 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHS]

00:08:34.850 --> 00:08:36.090 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Tell us about that.

00:08:36.090 --> 00:08:36.673 align:middle line:90%
>>RADOS: Yeah.

00:08:36.673 --> 00:08:42.309 align:middle line:84%
So, like, watching myself from
the ceiling and just realizing,

00:08:42.309 --> 00:08:45.400 align:middle line:84%
oh, I'm really
grateful for this.

00:08:45.400 --> 00:08:46.600 align:middle line:90%
Wow.

00:08:46.600 --> 00:08:49.680 align:middle line:84%
But immediately, the thought
of fear came, and I was--

00:08:49.680 --> 00:08:50.300 align:middle line:90%


00:08:50.300 --> 00:08:51.550 align:middle line:90%
--down there in my body.

00:08:51.550 --> 00:08:56.810 align:middle line:84%
And that triggered me
to explore certain ways

00:08:56.810 --> 00:09:02.020 align:middle line:84%
and certain methods to
attain my lost self.

00:09:02.020 --> 00:09:04.830 align:middle line:84%
My lost self meaning
that I lost myself

00:09:04.830 --> 00:09:06.710 align:middle line:90%
being raised by my family.

00:09:06.710 --> 00:09:07.580 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:09:07.580 --> 00:09:08.410 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

00:09:08.410 --> 00:09:11.200 align:middle line:90%
OK, so now you are 17.

00:09:11.200 --> 00:09:13.327 align:middle line:84%
You decide you're
going to be an artist.

00:09:13.327 --> 00:09:14.660 align:middle line:90%
Or that's when you start acting?

00:09:14.660 --> 00:09:15.020 align:middle line:90%
Both?

00:09:15.020 --> 00:09:15.660 align:middle line:90%
>>RADOS: That's right.

00:09:15.660 --> 00:09:16.240 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: OK.

00:09:16.240 --> 00:09:22.350 align:middle line:84%
And was it just something that
immediately expressed itself,

00:09:22.350 --> 00:09:23.760 align:middle line:90%
your incredible talent?

00:09:23.760 --> 00:09:27.080 align:middle line:84%
>>RADOS: It expressed
itself in an incredible way

00:09:27.080 --> 00:09:31.230 align:middle line:84%
because I was so amazed by what
was coming out of me, you see?

00:09:31.230 --> 00:09:33.580 align:middle line:90%
I was educating myself.

00:09:33.580 --> 00:09:36.870 align:middle line:84%
What we see as education,
it's nothing else

00:09:36.870 --> 00:09:38.620 align:middle line:90%
than indoctrination.

00:09:38.620 --> 00:09:42.000 align:middle line:84%
Educational systems are
indoctrinating kids,

00:09:42.000 --> 00:09:43.780 align:middle line:90%
giving them information.

00:09:43.780 --> 00:09:47.080 align:middle line:84%
This is information you have
to remember and act according

00:09:47.080 --> 00:09:50.390 align:middle line:84%
to that information, create
your life according to that,

00:09:50.390 --> 00:09:53.100 align:middle line:90%
think consensus.

00:09:53.100 --> 00:09:55.060 align:middle line:84%
But the real
meaning of education

00:09:55.060 --> 00:09:58.637 align:middle line:90%
is to draw out, to express--

00:09:58.637 --> 00:09:59.720 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Not to pound in.

00:09:59.720 --> 00:10:00.761 align:middle line:90%
>>RADOS: Not to pound in.

00:10:00.761 --> 00:10:05.110 align:middle line:84%
To express, do rediscover
something inside that

00:10:05.110 --> 00:10:06.820 align:middle line:90%
is there as a potential.

00:10:06.820 --> 00:10:12.340 align:middle line:84%
So expressing it can
be painful because you

00:10:12.340 --> 00:10:16.410 align:middle line:84%
have to go through
the dark wounds

00:10:16.410 --> 00:10:18.070 align:middle line:84%
in order to understand
them, in order

00:10:18.070 --> 00:10:21.010 align:middle line:84%
to express through the
creativity something that

00:10:21.010 --> 00:10:24.740 align:middle line:84%
is beyond those wounds
and the pain, you see?

00:10:24.740 --> 00:10:26.240 align:middle line:84%
And I was going
through that process

00:10:26.240 --> 00:10:29.620 align:middle line:84%
of rediscovering myself,
experiencing my anger,

00:10:29.620 --> 00:10:31.629 align:middle line:90%
experiencing my jealousy.

00:10:31.629 --> 00:10:33.170 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Was this
was showing itself

00:10:33.170 --> 00:10:34.720 align:middle line:90%
very literally in your artwork?

00:10:34.720 --> 00:10:35.910 align:middle line:90%
>>RADOS: Exactly.

00:10:35.910 --> 00:10:37.120 align:middle line:90%
Exactly.

00:10:37.120 --> 00:10:38.070 align:middle line:90%
Painting creatures.

00:10:38.070 --> 00:10:42.420 align:middle line:84%
My phantasmagoric dreams
and my nightmares.

00:10:42.420 --> 00:10:46.740 align:middle line:84%
I used to rip canvases and
paint them over and throw them

00:10:46.740 --> 00:10:49.440 align:middle line:84%
in garbage, burn them
with fire because I

00:10:49.440 --> 00:10:54.230 align:middle line:84%
was not-- I was going through
the internal process of giving

00:10:54.230 --> 00:10:55.580 align:middle line:90%
birth to myself.

00:10:55.580 --> 00:11:01.700 align:middle line:84%
So at one point, war happens,
and I found myself in England.

00:11:01.700 --> 00:11:08.320 align:middle line:84%
And thanks to that war, that war
took all the past away from me.

00:11:08.320 --> 00:11:09.400 align:middle line:90%
I'm very grateful.

00:11:09.400 --> 00:11:14.780 align:middle line:84%
I mean, unfortunately people
died, and people suffered.

00:11:14.780 --> 00:11:16.760 align:middle line:90%
For what, I don't know.

00:11:16.760 --> 00:11:20.890 align:middle line:84%
For the glory of the
mind of the powerful one.

00:11:20.890 --> 00:11:25.840 align:middle line:84%
But individually, I would
say that thanks to that war,

00:11:25.840 --> 00:11:28.660 align:middle line:84%
I finally disconnected from
my past and everything else.

00:11:28.660 --> 00:11:33.280 align:middle line:84%
And that set me on the journey
of really self-discovery

00:11:33.280 --> 00:11:37.940 align:middle line:84%
and using my art as
the spiritual method

00:11:37.940 --> 00:11:39.210 align:middle line:90%
in order to attain that.

00:11:39.210 --> 00:11:42.140 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Did you leave
Yugoslavia during those times

00:11:42.140 --> 00:11:43.584 align:middle line:90%
alone or with your family?

00:11:43.584 --> 00:11:45.250 align:middle line:84%
>>RADOS: With my
girlfriend in the time.

00:11:45.250 --> 00:11:45.880 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: In the time.

00:11:45.880 --> 00:11:46.665 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:11:46.665 --> 00:11:47.830 align:middle line:90%
>>RADOS: Yes.

00:11:47.830 --> 00:11:52.090 align:middle line:84%
And then went to England,
stationed myself there.

00:11:52.090 --> 00:11:55.300 align:middle line:84%
Very soon, got an
international art studio,

00:11:55.300 --> 00:11:56.860 align:middle line:90%
I think off Halifax.

00:11:56.860 --> 00:11:58.060 align:middle line:90%
That's northern Yorkshire.

00:11:58.060 --> 00:12:02.676 align:middle line:84%
Stayed there for 10 years
working intensively.

00:12:02.676 --> 00:12:03.800 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Studying English.

00:12:03.800 --> 00:12:04.883 align:middle line:90%
>>RADOS: Studying English.

00:12:04.883 --> 00:12:09.170 align:middle line:84%
Well, while my wife was studying
English for me, I was painting.

00:12:09.170 --> 00:12:11.947 align:middle line:84%
Studying myself
through the painting.

00:12:11.947 --> 00:12:12.530 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:12:12.530 --> 00:12:13.113 align:middle line:90%
>>RADOS: Yeah.

00:12:13.113 --> 00:12:17.190 align:middle line:90%


00:12:17.190 --> 00:12:23.030 align:middle line:84%
And at one point,
I was painting--

00:12:23.030 --> 00:12:29.790 align:middle line:84%
I took this spiritual approach,
art as my spiritual approach,

00:12:29.790 --> 00:12:32.970 align:middle line:90%
in tantric way.

00:12:32.970 --> 00:12:34.880 align:middle line:90%
I decided, I'm going to paint.

00:12:34.880 --> 00:12:36.910 align:middle line:90%
I'm going to go to my studio.

00:12:36.910 --> 00:12:41.940 align:middle line:84%
And I would say to Lana-- Lana,
don't expect me, you know?

00:12:41.940 --> 00:12:43.144 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: For how long?

00:12:43.144 --> 00:12:44.060 align:middle line:90%
>>RADOS: For how long?

00:12:44.060 --> 00:12:45.670 align:middle line:90%
Whenever I arrive.

00:12:45.670 --> 00:12:52.270 align:middle line:84%
And I would go there and be with
my brush and paint and myself

00:12:52.270 --> 00:12:56.760 align:middle line:84%
alone, and expressing,
educating myself.

00:12:56.760 --> 00:12:59.270 align:middle line:90%
Not sleeping, not eating.

00:12:59.270 --> 00:13:02.250 align:middle line:84%
Only drinking water, as
I'm drinking right now.

00:13:02.250 --> 00:13:04.330 align:middle line:90%
So for three, four days.

00:13:04.330 --> 00:13:08.350 align:middle line:90%
At one point-- I can't remember.

00:13:08.350 --> 00:13:14.020 align:middle line:90%
19-- 1999?

00:13:14.020 --> 00:13:17.076 align:middle line:90%
Just before millennium, 2000.

00:13:17.076 --> 00:13:19.677 align:middle line:84%
I stayed five days with no
drink, no water, no sleep.

00:13:19.677 --> 00:13:21.260 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Well, now,
that would create

00:13:21.260 --> 00:13:22.480 align:middle line:90%
some good hallucinations.

00:13:22.480 --> 00:13:24.040 align:middle line:90%
>>RADOS: Just water.

00:13:24.040 --> 00:13:26.330 align:middle line:84%
It created, at the
beginning-- of the three

00:13:26.330 --> 00:13:30.230 align:middle line:84%
days it created-- during those
three days, hallucinations.

00:13:30.230 --> 00:13:33.500 align:middle line:90%
My body was really wrecked.

00:13:33.500 --> 00:13:34.450 align:middle line:90%
Totally tired.

00:13:34.450 --> 00:13:36.310 align:middle line:90%
Absolutely exhausted.

00:13:36.310 --> 00:13:38.040 align:middle line:90%
Anxiety was kicking in.

00:13:38.040 --> 00:13:39.700 align:middle line:90%
The fear and all of that.

00:13:39.700 --> 00:13:42.780 align:middle line:84%
And I passed those
three challenging days,

00:13:42.780 --> 00:13:45.560 align:middle line:84%
and the fourth one
was in a way peaceful.

00:13:45.560 --> 00:13:48.760 align:middle line:84%
But I knew that this peaceful
was created because I passed

00:13:48.760 --> 00:13:50.740 align:middle line:90%
the first layer of energy.

00:13:50.740 --> 00:13:53.510 align:middle line:84%
And then coming to the second
one where more tranquil,

00:13:53.510 --> 00:13:54.930 align:middle line:90%
more peaceful.

00:13:54.930 --> 00:13:57.760 align:middle line:84%
But still, I had to
battle with my canvases.

00:13:57.760 --> 00:13:59.310 align:middle line:90%
I was fighting my canvases.

00:13:59.310 --> 00:14:02.669 align:middle line:84%
Fighting canvases, fighting
colors and clashing them

00:14:02.669 --> 00:14:04.210 align:middle line:84%
and with the brushes
and all of that.

00:14:04.210 --> 00:14:05.860 align:middle line:90%
I was clashing with my own self.

00:14:05.860 --> 00:14:10.580 align:middle line:84%
I was clashing myself in my
own mind between my good aspect

00:14:10.580 --> 00:14:12.350 align:middle line:90%
of me and bad aspect of me.

00:14:12.350 --> 00:14:16.210 align:middle line:84%
And there's just the
war there happening.

00:14:16.210 --> 00:14:23.270 align:middle line:84%
And then fifth day, I
remember that I was so tired.

00:14:23.270 --> 00:14:25.890 align:middle line:84%
I was so mentally tired,
exhausted physically.

00:14:25.890 --> 00:14:28.870 align:middle line:90%
And I decided I have to go home.

00:14:28.870 --> 00:14:32.750 align:middle line:84%
At that moment, my
body collapsed totally.

00:14:32.750 --> 00:14:33.940 align:middle line:90%
I could not wake up.

00:14:33.940 --> 00:14:35.450 align:middle line:90%
And I was aware.

00:14:35.450 --> 00:14:37.400 align:middle line:90%
And the thought came.

00:14:37.400 --> 00:14:40.390 align:middle line:84%
One thought came
ripping my head off.

00:14:40.390 --> 00:14:45.980 align:middle line:84%
And that thought said,
you are absolute failure.

00:14:45.980 --> 00:14:50.850 align:middle line:84%
Through the conflict, I come
to the feeling of failure.

00:14:50.850 --> 00:14:52.020 align:middle line:90%
And I surrender myself.

00:14:52.020 --> 00:14:53.600 align:middle line:84%
I surrendered the
thought of failure.

00:14:53.600 --> 00:14:58.230 align:middle line:84%
If I'm failure, there's no way
I can live in myself that way.

00:14:58.230 --> 00:15:00.360 align:middle line:90%
So I totally relaxed.

00:15:00.360 --> 00:15:00.860 align:middle line:90%
Totally--

00:15:00.860 --> 00:15:02.270 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: You gave up.

00:15:02.270 --> 00:15:03.270 align:middle line:90%
>>RADOS: Not gave up.

00:15:03.270 --> 00:15:03.900 align:middle line:90%
I gave in.

00:15:03.900 --> 00:15:04.650 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Gave in.

00:15:04.650 --> 00:15:05.149 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:15:05.149 --> 00:15:06.760 align:middle line:90%
Better put, yes.

00:15:06.760 --> 00:15:09.540 align:middle line:84%
>>RADOS: And then-- but
awareness was there.

00:15:09.540 --> 00:15:12.240 align:middle line:90%
Awareness that I am.

00:15:12.240 --> 00:15:15.120 align:middle line:84%
And that awareness was there
for I don't know for how long.

00:15:15.120 --> 00:15:19.780 align:middle line:84%
A day, two, three, five I
was there lying, not moving.

00:15:19.780 --> 00:15:23.343 align:middle line:84%
At one point, Lana was
ringing in my head.

00:15:23.343 --> 00:15:24.801 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: I was
going to say, yeah.

00:15:24.801 --> 00:15:26.840 align:middle line:84%
When did she come
and round you up?

00:15:26.840 --> 00:15:28.170 align:middle line:90%
>>RADOS: So I went home.

00:15:28.170 --> 00:15:30.650 align:middle line:90%
And that changed everything.

00:15:30.650 --> 00:15:34.370 align:middle line:84%
So after that, I see
reality differently.

00:15:34.370 --> 00:15:36.150 align:middle line:84%
I see actually
myself differently.

00:15:36.150 --> 00:15:39.240 align:middle line:84%
And then as a consequence of
seeing myself differently,

00:15:39.240 --> 00:15:40.997 align:middle line:90%
the reality changed around me.

00:15:40.997 --> 00:15:41.580 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:15:41.580 --> 00:15:45.390 align:middle line:84%
You know, one thing I really
have spent more time thinking

00:15:45.390 --> 00:15:47.430 align:middle line:84%
about recently--
and it had to do

00:15:47.430 --> 00:15:50.327 align:middle line:84%
with reading a book
regarding children who

00:15:50.327 --> 00:15:51.910 align:middle line:84%
are some of the new
wave of children--

00:15:51.910 --> 00:15:54.230 align:middle line:90%
and I know Kai is quite special.

00:15:54.230 --> 00:15:57.260 align:middle line:84%
And these children
who are so sensitive,

00:15:57.260 --> 00:15:58.480 align:middle line:90%
they feel everything.

00:15:58.480 --> 00:16:00.820 align:middle line:84%
They can barely sit
down because they're

00:16:00.820 --> 00:16:03.640 align:middle line:84%
absorbing so much of
the energy around them

00:16:03.640 --> 00:16:06.480 align:middle line:84%
that they need to dispel
it by just moving, just

00:16:06.480 --> 00:16:07.850 align:middle line:90%
moving all the time.

00:16:07.850 --> 00:16:10.470 align:middle line:84%
And as I was reading that, I
kept thinking about artists

00:16:10.470 --> 00:16:15.780 align:middle line:84%
and musicians, and how in
order to create at that level,

00:16:15.780 --> 00:16:18.239 align:middle line:84%
you would have to have
that degree of sensitivity.

00:16:18.239 --> 00:16:19.780 align:middle line:84%
And often, these
little kids have had

00:16:19.780 --> 00:16:21.540 align:middle line:90%
problems, people judging them.

00:16:21.540 --> 00:16:23.960 align:middle line:84%
In your case, you were an
empath and a little healer

00:16:23.960 --> 00:16:26.410 align:middle line:84%
when you were just
a little tiny guy.

00:16:26.410 --> 00:16:30.980 align:middle line:84%
So this is something I think
that the world needs to have,

00:16:30.980 --> 00:16:32.810 align:middle line:84%
or the rest of the
people in the world

00:16:32.810 --> 00:16:36.670 align:middle line:84%
need to learn to respect when
we read about artists that

00:16:36.670 --> 00:16:39.420 align:middle line:84%
are going off the rails, artists
that have turned to drugs

00:16:39.420 --> 00:16:41.810 align:middle line:84%
and reckless behavior,
and so forth because

00:16:41.810 --> 00:16:43.260 align:middle line:90%
of this sensitivity.

00:16:43.260 --> 00:16:44.260 align:middle line:90%
Can you talk about that?

00:16:44.260 --> 00:16:45.120 align:middle line:90%
>>RADOS: Yes.

00:16:45.120 --> 00:16:49.390 align:middle line:84%
The reason for that,
art is going away.

00:16:49.390 --> 00:16:53.472 align:middle line:84%
Away from goodness,
put it this way.

00:16:53.472 --> 00:16:58.490 align:middle line:84%
And it's because artists
don't carry themselves

00:16:58.490 --> 00:17:00.470 align:middle line:90%
with what they're doing.

00:17:00.470 --> 00:17:02.137 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Explain
what you mean by that,

00:17:02.137 --> 00:17:04.511 align:middle line:84%
that they don't carry themselves
with what they're doing.

00:17:04.511 --> 00:17:05.260 align:middle line:90%
What do you mean?

00:17:05.260 --> 00:17:08.420 align:middle line:84%
>>RADOS: They are not
aware what they are doing.

00:17:08.420 --> 00:17:12.440 align:middle line:84%
They're not conscious while
whatever they're doing.

00:17:12.440 --> 00:17:17.530 align:middle line:84%
So carrying on, being--
paying attention to themselves

00:17:17.530 --> 00:17:21.710 align:middle line:84%
while paying attention to what
they're doing, whatever that

00:17:21.710 --> 00:17:22.210 align:middle line:90%
might be.

00:17:22.210 --> 00:17:26.000 align:middle line:84%
The idea of achieving
something, the idea of attaining

00:17:26.000 --> 00:17:28.890 align:middle line:84%
something, attaining great
painting, showing the world

00:17:28.890 --> 00:17:30.520 align:middle line:90%
that I'm the great artist.

00:17:30.520 --> 00:17:34.620 align:middle line:84%
Being aware of that attempt,
being aware of that ego input,

00:17:34.620 --> 00:17:39.130 align:middle line:84%
but also being aware of the
one who created that input.

00:17:39.130 --> 00:17:42.200 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Is it possible that
through that extreme openness

00:17:42.200 --> 00:17:44.350 align:middle line:90%
combined with ego and to excel--

00:17:44.350 --> 00:17:46.375 align:middle line:84%
>>RADOS: Then you
become creative.

00:17:46.375 --> 00:17:48.000 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: But aren't
you also a vehicle

00:17:48.000 --> 00:17:50.717 align:middle line:84%
for pretty much
anything that's there?

00:17:50.717 --> 00:17:52.550 align:middle line:84%
>>RADOS: You open
yourself to the wholeness.

00:17:52.550 --> 00:17:53.140 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:17:53.140 --> 00:17:54.640 align:middle line:84%
>>RADOS: You don't
have preconceived

00:17:54.640 --> 00:17:55.760 align:middle line:90%
idea of what to paint.

00:17:55.760 --> 00:17:57.740 align:middle line:84%
You don't have
preconceived idea of what

00:17:57.740 --> 00:17:59.830 align:middle line:90%
to create in the reality.

00:17:59.830 --> 00:18:02.700 align:middle line:84%
You have just openness
and receptivity.

00:18:02.700 --> 00:18:04.690 align:middle line:84%
And whatever comes,
you just express that.

00:18:04.690 --> 00:18:09.215 align:middle line:84%
You use the mind as a tool,
not being used by your mind.

00:18:09.215 --> 00:18:10.090 align:middle line:90%
Do you see the point?

00:18:10.090 --> 00:18:10.850 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:18:10.850 --> 00:18:15.450 align:middle line:84%
>>RADOS: So generally,
99.99% of population on earth

00:18:15.450 --> 00:18:17.350 align:middle line:90%
is used by the mind.

00:18:17.350 --> 00:18:20.017 align:middle line:84%
And the mind is the
master of people's life.

00:18:20.017 --> 00:18:20.600 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:18:20.600 --> 00:18:23.310 align:middle line:84%
>>RADOS: And the mind is
controlled by society.

00:18:23.310 --> 00:18:26.440 align:middle line:84%
You have to think certain way,
you have to behave certain way.

00:18:26.440 --> 00:18:28.100 align:middle line:90%
You have to be certain way.

00:18:28.100 --> 00:18:32.420 align:middle line:84%
You have to show your support,
your loyalty, your obedience.

00:18:32.420 --> 00:18:36.180 align:middle line:84%
You have to follow certain
norms and conditions, morality

00:18:36.180 --> 00:18:37.750 align:middle line:90%
and stuff like that.

00:18:37.750 --> 00:18:39.000 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:18:39.000 --> 00:18:43.030 align:middle line:84%
>>RADOS: But when you get out
of that obligation of fulfilling

00:18:43.030 --> 00:18:45.760 align:middle line:84%
the ideas of what
life is, according

00:18:45.760 --> 00:18:48.710 align:middle line:84%
to the mind,
expectations and desires,

00:18:48.710 --> 00:18:52.540 align:middle line:84%
then you come to the real life
that is called individuality,

00:18:52.540 --> 00:18:54.060 align:middle line:90%
you become individual.

00:18:54.060 --> 00:18:57.290 align:middle line:84%
You can live in the society,
but you cannot really follow

00:18:57.290 --> 00:18:59.190 align:middle line:90%
the rules of society.

00:18:59.190 --> 00:19:01.830 align:middle line:84%
You follow the rules
of love and compassion

00:19:01.830 --> 00:19:05.555 align:middle line:84%
because we relate to each
other on an individual level.

00:19:05.555 --> 00:19:09.420 align:middle line:84%
On the abstract
level of society,

00:19:09.420 --> 00:19:11.650 align:middle line:84%
we have a relationship
with each other.

00:19:11.650 --> 00:19:14.050 align:middle line:84%
We have a ship, and we
are traveling together

00:19:14.050 --> 00:19:16.050 align:middle line:90%
to gain something together.

00:19:16.050 --> 00:19:19.480 align:middle line:90%
Glories, progress, whatever.

00:19:19.480 --> 00:19:20.590 align:middle line:90%
Satisfaction.

00:19:20.590 --> 00:19:24.790 align:middle line:84%
And outside, causes
and consequences.

00:19:24.790 --> 00:19:28.040 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So what happens
when, as in America,

00:19:28.040 --> 00:19:33.110 align:middle line:84%
you completely remove art
from the educational system?

00:19:33.110 --> 00:19:34.470 align:middle line:90%
For example, that's no longer--

00:19:34.470 --> 00:19:35.900 align:middle line:90%
>>RADOS: You create robots.

00:19:35.900 --> 00:19:37.620 align:middle line:90%
You create machines.

00:19:37.620 --> 00:19:42.180 align:middle line:84%
You create soldiers,
workers, and warriors.

00:19:42.180 --> 00:19:43.930 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Let's talk
about that for a bit.

00:19:43.930 --> 00:19:46.590 align:middle line:84%
I mean, you've bridged
different kinds of cultures.

00:19:46.590 --> 00:19:49.520 align:middle line:84%
And you know,
what's interesting,

00:19:49.520 --> 00:19:53.650 align:middle line:84%
I always found interesting in
the day about the Soviet empire

00:19:53.650 --> 00:19:57.340 align:middle line:84%
is that arts-- the
arts were elevated,

00:19:57.340 --> 00:19:59.940 align:middle line:84%
where here at the same time,
they were being destroyed.

00:19:59.940 --> 00:20:01.390 align:middle line:90%
>>RADOS: Art was controlled.

00:20:01.390 --> 00:20:02.700 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: But controlled, yes.

00:20:02.700 --> 00:20:05.130 align:middle line:84%
And I want you to explain
this whole thing to us.

00:20:05.130 --> 00:20:08.400 align:middle line:84%
>>RADOS: But even Western
art was controlled.

00:20:08.400 --> 00:20:14.020 align:middle line:84%
Because you see,
through controlling art,

00:20:14.020 --> 00:20:17.402 align:middle line:84%
you're controlling
consciousness directly.

00:20:17.402 --> 00:20:18.980 align:middle line:90%
You see?

00:20:18.980 --> 00:20:23.490 align:middle line:84%
You are giving consciousness
rules and obligations.

00:20:23.490 --> 00:20:25.820 align:middle line:84%
That's called social
engineering, you see?

00:20:25.820 --> 00:20:28.710 align:middle line:84%
We are-- Hollywood
is a big [INAUDIBLE],

00:20:28.710 --> 00:20:31.630 align:middle line:84%
educating the entire
world what to think.

00:20:31.630 --> 00:20:34.420 align:middle line:90%
Creating movement in society.

00:20:34.420 --> 00:20:35.507 align:middle line:90%
You see?

00:20:35.507 --> 00:20:36.090 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:20:36.090 --> 00:20:38.830 align:middle line:84%
I mean, this subject I
find really fascinating.

00:20:38.830 --> 00:20:42.500 align:middle line:84%
For example, you've shown at
to Tate, I go into the Tate,

00:20:42.500 --> 00:20:44.300 align:middle line:84%
and there are times
I have to walk out,

00:20:44.300 --> 00:20:46.640 align:middle line:84%
there's so much
dissonance in the art.

00:20:46.640 --> 00:20:48.764 align:middle line:84%
So much-- it is
modern art, of course,

00:20:48.764 --> 00:20:50.680 align:middle line:84%
so it's whatever the
impression of the artist.

00:20:50.680 --> 00:20:55.740 align:middle line:84%
But for me as a being, I'll
find so much dissonance in it.

00:20:55.740 --> 00:20:58.380 align:middle line:84%
And I have read about
CIA agendas having

00:20:58.380 --> 00:21:00.490 align:middle line:84%
to do between the
Soviets and the Americans

00:21:00.490 --> 00:21:02.440 align:middle line:84%
and the control of
art and so forth.

00:21:02.440 --> 00:21:03.450 align:middle line:90%
I mean, I get all that.

00:21:03.450 --> 00:21:06.780 align:middle line:84%
We can go down the
conspiracy theory rabbit hole

00:21:06.780 --> 00:21:07.900 align:middle line:90%
pretty easily on this one.

00:21:07.900 --> 00:21:10.660 align:middle line:84%
And I think a lot of
it is possibly true.

00:21:10.660 --> 00:21:15.570 align:middle line:84%
But interestingly, I had
read a particular document

00:21:15.570 --> 00:21:18.830 align:middle line:84%
that appeared in the
Congressional Journal.

00:21:18.830 --> 00:21:22.000 align:middle line:84%
And it had to do with a
judiciary subcommittee

00:21:22.000 --> 00:21:25.780 align:middle line:84%
of some kind was
hearing testimony

00:21:25.780 --> 00:21:30.050 align:middle line:84%
regarding an infiltration
into the communist agenda.

00:21:30.050 --> 00:21:33.740 align:middle line:84%
Whatever communist agenda
actually means in America.

00:21:33.740 --> 00:21:36.730 align:middle line:84%
And one of the things--
a few of the points.

00:21:36.730 --> 00:21:40.370 align:middle line:84%
And one was for the
communists to gain control

00:21:40.370 --> 00:21:42.630 align:middle line:84%
of any editorial
positions having

00:21:42.630 --> 00:21:44.810 align:middle line:84%
to do with art in
the publications

00:21:44.810 --> 00:21:49.350 align:middle line:84%
throughout the country, to gain
positions as museum curators.

00:21:49.350 --> 00:21:56.140 align:middle line:84%
And then to promote
asymmetry in art.

00:21:56.140 --> 00:22:02.890 align:middle line:84%
Now I bring this up because
you were doing modern art.

00:22:02.890 --> 00:22:06.730 align:middle line:84%
But what you're doing
now is this incredibly

00:22:06.730 --> 00:22:10.160 align:middle line:84%
symmetrical, beautiful,
geometrical representation

00:22:10.160 --> 00:22:11.460 align:middle line:90%
of consciousness.

00:22:11.460 --> 00:22:13.740 align:middle line:84%
Can you talk about-- I
know I just brought up

00:22:13.740 --> 00:22:16.830 align:middle line:84%
a lot of things-- can you
tie that all together,

00:22:16.830 --> 00:22:18.256 align:middle line:90%
what's happening?

00:22:18.256 --> 00:22:18.880 align:middle line:90%
>>RADOS: I can.

00:22:18.880 --> 00:22:24.875 align:middle line:84%
One day in my studio, two events
brought me to a realization.

00:22:24.875 --> 00:22:27.400 align:middle line:90%


00:22:27.400 --> 00:22:31.410 align:middle line:84%
One event was I had
that studio Dean Clough,

00:22:31.410 --> 00:22:35.410 align:middle line:84%
Halifax with 20 artists,
international artists.

00:22:35.410 --> 00:22:36.160 align:middle line:90%
Huge, big complex.

00:22:36.160 --> 00:22:40.580 align:middle line:84%
Used to be a carpet factory
owned by Sir Ernest Hall who

00:22:40.580 --> 00:22:43.190 align:middle line:84%
socialized with
Prince Charles and who

00:22:43.190 --> 00:22:46.250 align:middle line:84%
married one of the
royalties, aristocrat.

00:22:46.250 --> 00:22:50.840 align:middle line:84%
And he brought one Lord to
my studio, appointed directly

00:22:50.840 --> 00:22:52.910 align:middle line:90%
by queen.

00:22:52.910 --> 00:22:54.870 align:middle line:84%
Because as a part
of agreement, I

00:22:54.870 --> 00:22:58.110 align:middle line:84%
had to open my studio
for public, for a day.

00:22:58.110 --> 00:23:02.260 align:middle line:84%
Whoever wants to come to chat
with an artist is welcome.

00:23:02.260 --> 00:23:04.490 align:middle line:84%
And he brought a
Lord because he was

00:23:04.490 --> 00:23:09.580 align:middle line:84%
visiting Halifax, that
complex, came as a friend.

00:23:09.580 --> 00:23:11.650 align:middle line:84%
I was very well
known as an artist.

00:23:11.650 --> 00:23:14.740 align:middle line:84%
People used to stop me
on the street saying,

00:23:14.740 --> 00:23:17.430 align:middle line:90%
oh, I've seen you in-- whatever.

00:23:17.430 --> 00:23:18.720 align:middle line:90%
Daily Telegraph.

00:23:18.720 --> 00:23:21.164 align:middle line:90%
I've seen you in BBC.

00:23:21.164 --> 00:23:22.330 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: You're a big deal.

00:23:22.330 --> 00:23:23.640 align:middle line:90%
Absolutely.

00:23:23.640 --> 00:23:26.420 align:middle line:84%
>>RADOS: It flattered
my ego at the time.

00:23:26.420 --> 00:23:31.060 align:middle line:84%
And the Lord came, and
he didn't look at my art.

00:23:31.060 --> 00:23:33.260 align:middle line:90%
He was looking at the ceiling.

00:23:33.260 --> 00:23:37.540 align:middle line:90%
He said, where do you live?

00:23:37.540 --> 00:23:41.140 align:middle line:90%
I said, nowhere.

00:23:41.140 --> 00:23:43.410 align:middle line:90%
And he said, where are you from?

00:23:43.410 --> 00:23:44.870 align:middle line:90%
I said, I just told you.

00:23:44.870 --> 00:23:46.600 align:middle line:90%
Nowhere.

00:23:46.600 --> 00:23:47.930 align:middle line:90%
He said, who are you?

00:23:47.930 --> 00:23:50.560 align:middle line:90%
I said, nobody.

00:23:50.560 --> 00:23:52.217 align:middle line:90%
He said, that cannot be.

00:23:52.217 --> 00:23:53.550 align:middle line:90%
First time he looked at my eyes.

00:23:53.550 --> 00:23:55.530 align:middle line:90%
He said, this cannot be.

00:23:55.530 --> 00:23:58.450 align:middle line:84%
I said, it can because
it's my reality.

00:23:58.450 --> 00:24:00.170 align:middle line:90%
What is your reality, I said.

00:24:00.170 --> 00:24:02.350 align:middle line:90%
He said, how dare you?

00:24:02.350 --> 00:24:02.892 align:middle line:90%
I said, what?

00:24:02.892 --> 00:24:04.141 align:middle line:90%
Asking you about your reality.

00:24:04.141 --> 00:24:04.880 align:middle line:90%
Who are you?

00:24:04.880 --> 00:24:05.965 align:middle line:90%
Where are you from?

00:24:05.965 --> 00:24:07.850 align:middle line:90%
He said, this is nonsense.

00:24:07.850 --> 00:24:10.080 align:middle line:90%
He left my studio.

00:24:10.080 --> 00:24:13.410 align:middle line:84%
And Ernest Hall said, what
did you do to that man?

00:24:13.410 --> 00:24:14.400 align:middle line:90%
I said, nothing.

00:24:14.400 --> 00:24:16.010 align:middle line:90%
I was just myself.

00:24:16.010 --> 00:24:17.500 align:middle line:90%
So that was one event.

00:24:17.500 --> 00:24:21.280 align:middle line:84%
Another one, two days later,
someone knocked on my door.

00:24:21.280 --> 00:24:22.724 align:middle line:90%
Artist.

00:24:22.724 --> 00:24:24.390 align:middle line:84%
Which I'm not going
to mention his name.

00:24:24.390 --> 00:24:28.450 align:middle line:84%
And he said, Ivan, uh,
my master sent me to you.

00:24:28.450 --> 00:24:29.707 align:middle line:90%
And I said, your master?

00:24:29.707 --> 00:24:30.290 align:middle line:90%
He said, yeah.

00:24:30.290 --> 00:24:31.590 align:middle line:90%
Grandmaster.

00:24:31.590 --> 00:24:33.610 align:middle line:90%
And we usually don't do that.

00:24:33.610 --> 00:24:36.440 align:middle line:84%
But we would like you
to consider joining us.

00:24:36.440 --> 00:24:37.450 align:middle line:90%
I said, who are you?

00:24:37.450 --> 00:24:38.826 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Of which order?

00:24:38.826 --> 00:24:39.450 align:middle line:90%
>>RADOS: Order.

00:24:39.450 --> 00:24:40.360 align:middle line:90%
Masonic order.

00:24:40.360 --> 00:24:42.640 align:middle line:90%
Halifax is well known for that.

00:24:42.640 --> 00:24:44.690 align:middle line:90%
I said, oh, OK.

00:24:44.690 --> 00:24:45.840 align:middle line:90%
So to be a mason.

00:24:45.840 --> 00:24:48.220 align:middle line:90%
He said, yeah.

00:24:48.220 --> 00:24:49.910 align:middle line:90%
You deserve that.

00:24:49.910 --> 00:24:55.430 align:middle line:84%
I said, can you say to
your Lord, to your master,

00:24:55.430 --> 00:24:56.770 align:middle line:90%
I'm really grateful.

00:24:56.770 --> 00:25:00.580 align:middle line:84%
I really, really am grateful
for this opportunity

00:25:00.580 --> 00:25:04.710 align:middle line:84%
to join your cause,
whatever that cause is.

00:25:04.710 --> 00:25:06.860 align:middle line:90%
But I have to stay myself.

00:25:06.860 --> 00:25:09.520 align:middle line:90%
I have to respect myself.

00:25:09.520 --> 00:25:12.030 align:middle line:84%
I am never going
to join anything.

00:25:12.030 --> 00:25:15.729 align:middle line:84%
But please, you master
would understand that.

00:25:15.729 --> 00:25:16.770 align:middle line:90%
He said, I appreciate it.

00:25:16.770 --> 00:25:17.670 align:middle line:90%
Thank you very much.

00:25:17.670 --> 00:25:19.180 align:middle line:90%
Thank you very much.

00:25:19.180 --> 00:25:21.750 align:middle line:84%
And I came home and
I said to my wife--

00:25:21.750 --> 00:25:24.235 align:middle line:84%
I haven't seen her for
three days, those three,

00:25:24.235 --> 00:25:27.910 align:middle line:84%
four days that Lord happened
and that event happened.

00:25:27.910 --> 00:25:30.070 align:middle line:90%
I said, you know what happened?

00:25:30.070 --> 00:25:33.340 align:middle line:84%
That Lord came and
he left, furious.

00:25:33.340 --> 00:25:37.350 align:middle line:84%
And then two days later,
they asked me to join masons.

00:25:37.350 --> 00:25:39.290 align:middle line:90%
Oh Ivan, and what did you say?

00:25:39.290 --> 00:25:40.970 align:middle line:90%
I said, no.

00:25:40.970 --> 00:25:43.550 align:middle line:84%
And she said, you just
refused your success.

00:25:43.550 --> 00:25:45.830 align:middle line:84%
You just said no
to your success.

00:25:45.830 --> 00:25:49.210 align:middle line:84%
And you clashed the entire
structure of society

00:25:49.210 --> 00:25:53.860 align:middle line:84%
by pointing at the Lord and
saying, you are not my Lord.

00:25:53.860 --> 00:25:56.700 align:middle line:84%
And after that, everything's
changing because then I

00:25:56.700 --> 00:25:57.640 align:middle line:90%
start seeing things.

00:25:57.640 --> 00:26:00.744 align:middle line:84%
And that five days
happens and then, bang.

00:26:00.744 --> 00:26:01.660 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Interesting.

00:26:01.660 --> 00:26:02.440 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:26:02.440 --> 00:26:05.420 align:middle line:84%
So you found this
kind of congruently

00:26:05.420 --> 00:26:07.660 align:middle line:84%
within yourself
after this five days,

00:26:07.660 --> 00:26:10.440 align:middle line:84%
this clash between these
parts of your own mind.

00:26:10.440 --> 00:26:12.660 align:middle line:84%
And I want to go back to
what I brought up earlier.

00:26:12.660 --> 00:26:15.490 align:middle line:84%
This clash with our own
perception on something

00:26:15.490 --> 00:26:18.802 align:middle line:84%
as simple as asymmetry
versus symmetry.

00:26:18.802 --> 00:26:19.510 align:middle line:90%
>>RADOS: Exactly.

00:26:19.510 --> 00:26:24.710 align:middle line:84%
So my point here is, if
you follow certain rules,

00:26:24.710 --> 00:26:27.265 align:middle line:84%
if you follow
certain norms, if you

00:26:27.265 --> 00:26:32.490 align:middle line:84%
are using your creativity
just to prove your own ego,

00:26:32.490 --> 00:26:34.230 align:middle line:90%
then you're a majority.

00:26:34.230 --> 00:26:37.780 align:middle line:84%
Only individuals
who are using art

00:26:37.780 --> 00:26:42.230 align:middle line:84%
to explore who they are on
that path of real creativity.

00:26:42.230 --> 00:26:45.580 align:middle line:84%
Everything else is a
flower, a plastic flower

00:26:45.580 --> 00:26:51.270 align:middle line:84%
while inner exploration through
creativity is your awakening,

00:26:51.270 --> 00:26:52.920 align:middle line:90%
is the real fragrance of flower.

00:26:52.920 --> 00:26:54.650 align:middle line:84%
It's the real
meditation, you see.

00:26:54.650 --> 00:26:58.430 align:middle line:84%
So very rarely you
will find real artist.

00:26:58.430 --> 00:27:01.030 align:middle line:84%
If you find real
artist, guarantee

00:27:01.030 --> 00:27:06.007 align:middle line:84%
99.99%, that artist does not
belong to any organization,

00:27:06.007 --> 00:27:06.590 align:middle line:90%
is individual.

00:27:06.590 --> 00:27:09.940 align:middle line:84%
He is exhibiting in small
galleries somewhere else.

00:27:09.940 --> 00:27:15.710 align:middle line:84%
Big galleries are there to
guide people what to think.

00:27:15.710 --> 00:27:17.070 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:27:17.070 --> 00:27:18.210 align:middle line:90%
Including the Tate.

00:27:18.210 --> 00:27:19.760 align:middle line:90%
>>RADOS: Including the Tate.

00:27:19.760 --> 00:27:27.270 align:middle line:84%
Because you see, it's the
play between-- the secret

00:27:27.270 --> 00:27:33.930 align:middle line:84%
is using the symbology, using
sacred geometry to enclose

00:27:33.930 --> 00:27:35.850 align:middle line:90%
the space you are in.

00:27:35.850 --> 00:27:39.440 align:middle line:84%
When you're enclosed in that
space, you become finite.

00:27:39.440 --> 00:27:40.880 align:middle line:90%
You're not infinite anymore.

00:27:40.880 --> 00:27:43.720 align:middle line:84%
You're not exploring yourself
in the infinite field

00:27:43.720 --> 00:27:45.280 align:middle line:90%
of possibilities.

00:27:45.280 --> 00:27:47.480 align:middle line:84%
You have only a couple
of possibilities.

00:27:47.480 --> 00:27:50.075 align:middle line:84%
And those possibilities,
only those possibilities

00:27:50.075 --> 00:27:55.280 align:middle line:84%
are promoted in galleries
as a way to control people.

00:27:55.280 --> 00:27:57.170 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So let's
talk about modern art.

00:27:57.170 --> 00:28:00.050 align:middle line:84%
Let's talk about what modern
art does to control people,

00:28:00.050 --> 00:28:03.002 align:middle line:84%
versus Renaissance
or classic art.

00:28:03.002 --> 00:28:06.230 align:middle line:84%
Let's talk about the
different kinds of control.

00:28:06.230 --> 00:28:07.420 align:middle line:90%
>>RADOS: What's modern art?

00:28:07.420 --> 00:28:08.920 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Well, I
mean abstract art.

00:28:08.920 --> 00:28:11.270 align:middle line:84%
Not modern, but let's
say very abstract art.

00:28:11.270 --> 00:28:12.480 align:middle line:90%
>>RADOS: Very abstract art.

00:28:12.480 --> 00:28:15.950 align:middle line:84%
Abstract art refers
to abstract mind.

00:28:15.950 --> 00:28:19.160 align:middle line:84%
So only abstract mind can
understand abstract art.

00:28:19.160 --> 00:28:23.020 align:middle line:84%
So abstract mind is the thought
that you cannot control,

00:28:23.020 --> 00:28:26.680 align:middle line:84%
that you're not aware of
that this there in repetitive

00:28:26.680 --> 00:28:27.420 align:middle line:90%
situation.

00:28:27.420 --> 00:28:29.170 align:middle line:90%
Always moving, you know?

00:28:29.170 --> 00:28:31.480 align:middle line:84%
Coming and coming, coming
and going, coming and going.

00:28:31.480 --> 00:28:34.140 align:middle line:84%
It's an exploration
of the same phenomena

00:28:34.140 --> 00:28:36.240 align:middle line:90%
over and over and over again.

00:28:36.240 --> 00:28:38.074 align:middle line:90%
That's called zombie state.

00:28:38.074 --> 00:28:39.930 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:28:39.930 --> 00:28:42.020 align:middle line:90%
And did I misunderstand you?

00:28:42.020 --> 00:28:45.712 align:middle line:84%
Did you say abstract art
perpetuates that state?

00:28:45.712 --> 00:28:46.420 align:middle line:90%
>>RADOS: Exactly.

00:28:46.420 --> 00:28:48.750 align:middle line:84%
Because to understand
the abstract art,

00:28:48.750 --> 00:28:50.960 align:middle line:90%
you have to have abstract mind.

00:28:50.960 --> 00:28:51.560 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: OK.

00:28:51.560 --> 00:28:53.060 align:middle line:84%
I understand what
you're saying now.

00:28:53.060 --> 00:28:54.920 align:middle line:90%
That's very interesting.

00:28:54.920 --> 00:28:57.620 align:middle line:84%
>>RADOS: You see, if
you have whole mind,

00:28:57.620 --> 00:29:00.270 align:middle line:90%
whole mind is no mind.

00:29:00.270 --> 00:29:03.410 align:middle line:90%
Whole mind is the mind hollow.

00:29:03.410 --> 00:29:04.760 align:middle line:90%
Hollow bamboo.

00:29:04.760 --> 00:29:08.086 align:middle line:84%
On one side is divine,
one other side is you.

00:29:08.086 --> 00:29:09.800 align:middle line:90%
You can call the divine god.

00:29:09.800 --> 00:29:11.480 align:middle line:84%
You can call the
divine wholeness,

00:29:11.480 --> 00:29:14.300 align:middle line:90%
existence, the truth.

00:29:14.300 --> 00:29:15.860 align:middle line:90%
On the other side is you.

00:29:15.860 --> 00:29:20.850 align:middle line:84%
The mind is the link, is a tube
between infinite and something

00:29:20.850 --> 00:29:23.060 align:middle line:90%
that is finite.

00:29:23.060 --> 00:29:23.930 align:middle line:90%
As appearance.

00:29:23.930 --> 00:29:25.500 align:middle line:84%
It appears as
finite, but it's not.

00:29:25.500 --> 00:29:27.240 align:middle line:90%
It's just a bubble.

00:29:27.240 --> 00:29:28.700 align:middle line:90%
It appears that way.

00:29:28.700 --> 00:29:31.720 align:middle line:90%
But the mind is there as a link.

00:29:31.720 --> 00:29:35.230 align:middle line:84%
Once you clog your mind
with thoughts, then

00:29:35.230 --> 00:29:37.530 align:middle line:84%
you disconnect yourself
from the wholeness.

00:29:37.530 --> 00:29:40.350 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Which abstract
art forces you to do.

00:29:40.350 --> 00:29:41.241 align:middle line:90%
>>RADOS: Exactly.

00:29:41.241 --> 00:29:42.740 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: That's
what I always felt.

00:29:42.740 --> 00:29:45.980 align:middle line:84%
And I felt that it was
in itself an agenda,

00:29:45.980 --> 00:29:49.420 align:middle line:84%
particularly after reading
that particular-- that entry

00:29:49.420 --> 00:29:52.730 align:middle line:84%
in the Congressional
Journal right after Kennedy

00:29:52.730 --> 00:29:54.650 align:middle line:90%
was assassinated.

00:29:54.650 --> 00:29:57.155 align:middle line:84%
>>RADOS: It's the way to
control people's consciousness.

00:29:57.155 --> 00:29:59.005 align:middle line:90%
It's not to control their mind.

00:29:59.005 --> 00:30:00.380 align:middle line:84%
Their mind is
already controlled.

00:30:00.380 --> 00:30:02.820 align:middle line:10%
Because your mind
is not your mind.

00:30:02.820 --> 00:30:04.340 align:middle line:10%
It's society's mind.

00:30:04.340 --> 00:30:06.490 align:middle line:90%
So you don't have your thoughts.

00:30:06.490 --> 00:30:08.077 align:middle line:90%
You don't think your thoughts.

00:30:08.077 --> 00:30:10.160 align:middle line:84%
You cannot say, oh, this
thought is very original.

00:30:10.160 --> 00:30:11.440 align:middle line:90%
It's mine.

00:30:11.440 --> 00:30:12.430 align:middle line:90%
No, it's not.

00:30:12.430 --> 00:30:14.470 align:middle line:84%
Your thought is
recycled thought.

00:30:14.470 --> 00:30:15.630 align:middle line:90%
Borrowed thought.

00:30:15.630 --> 00:30:19.590 align:middle line:84%
Someone else thought that
before, and before, and before.

00:30:19.590 --> 00:30:22.630 align:middle line:84%
It's there, circulating,
coming and going.

00:30:22.630 --> 00:30:24.290 align:middle line:90%
That's called karma.

00:30:24.290 --> 00:30:25.460 align:middle line:90%
That's called reincarnation.

00:30:25.460 --> 00:30:29.740 align:middle line:84%
You are coming back again to
the same structure of the mind,

00:30:29.740 --> 00:30:33.049 align:middle line:84%
the same reality of the mind
where thoughts are rolling.

00:30:33.049 --> 00:30:33.590 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: OK.

00:30:33.590 --> 00:30:35.510 align:middle line:84%
So now we look at art
where you're maybe

00:30:35.510 --> 00:30:37.480 align:middle line:90%
going in for an experience.

00:30:37.480 --> 00:30:39.930 align:middle line:84%
But if we go into
abstract art fully,

00:30:39.930 --> 00:30:43.145 align:middle line:84%
you have to engage the
mind down that chute.

00:30:43.145 --> 00:30:44.020 align:middle line:90%
>>RADOS: You have to.

00:30:44.020 --> 00:30:45.057 align:middle line:90%
You have to focus.

00:30:45.057 --> 00:30:46.140 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: You can't just--

00:30:46.140 --> 00:30:47.580 align:middle line:84%
>>RADOS: You cannot
take it whole.

00:30:47.580 --> 00:30:49.390 align:middle line:84%
You see, the mind
cannot take it whole.

00:30:49.390 --> 00:30:52.370 align:middle line:84%
The mind either is in the
past or in the future.

00:30:52.370 --> 00:30:53.770 align:middle line:90%
Lost.

00:30:53.770 --> 00:30:55.050 align:middle line:90%
You know?

00:30:55.050 --> 00:30:58.350 align:middle line:84%
The moment now does not
belong to the time frame.

00:30:58.350 --> 00:31:00.675 align:middle line:90%
It's now.

00:31:00.675 --> 00:31:03.610 align:middle line:84%
Now is life
happening infinitely.

00:31:03.610 --> 00:31:06.165 align:middle line:90%
Now there are no thoughts.

00:31:06.165 --> 00:31:07.670 align:middle line:90%
The wholeness does not think.

00:31:07.670 --> 00:31:10.570 align:middle line:84%
God does not have
any thoughts of you.

00:31:10.570 --> 00:31:14.510 align:middle line:84%
God is ultimate awareness of
itself, and that's what now is.

00:31:14.510 --> 00:31:17.430 align:middle line:84%
When you become aware
that you are now,

00:31:17.430 --> 00:31:19.120 align:middle line:90%
you don't have any mind.

00:31:19.120 --> 00:31:23.510 align:middle line:84%
You have a machine, a tool that
you can use if you need it.

00:31:23.510 --> 00:31:26.020 align:middle line:84%
You can focus yourself
if you need it.

00:31:26.020 --> 00:31:31.320 align:middle line:84%
But if your focus is 24
hours a day, 356 days a year,

00:31:31.320 --> 00:31:32.990 align:middle line:90%
then that's the abstract.

00:31:32.990 --> 00:31:35.850 align:middle line:84%
So you're creating a separate
reality out of the wholeness,

00:31:35.850 --> 00:31:36.710 align:middle line:90%
from the wholeness.

00:31:36.710 --> 00:31:38.050 align:middle line:90%
You are in separation.

00:31:38.050 --> 00:31:41.240 align:middle line:84%
You're in this connected
state of being.

00:31:41.240 --> 00:31:45.021 align:middle line:84%
And then you are there
to rule and to be ruled.

00:31:45.021 --> 00:31:46.520 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: I really
appreciate your--

00:31:46.520 --> 00:31:47.895 align:middle line:84%
it's the first
time I've actually

00:31:47.895 --> 00:31:49.720 align:middle line:84%
asked an artist about
this, and you've

00:31:49.720 --> 00:31:53.410 align:middle line:84%
explained it in a way that
is totally congruent with me.

00:31:53.410 --> 00:31:55.260 align:middle line:90%
That's my feeling about it.

00:31:55.260 --> 00:31:57.230 align:middle line:84%
Now let's talk
about what you did

00:31:57.230 --> 00:32:00.450 align:middle line:84%
when you-- moving into
geometry, sacred geometry,

00:32:00.450 --> 00:32:03.430 align:middle line:84%
and the beautiful yantras
you do, what happened there?

00:32:03.430 --> 00:32:05.160 align:middle line:84%
>>RADOS: You see,
when you're going--

00:32:05.160 --> 00:32:10.060 align:middle line:84%
in order to attain something,
you need to have an effort,

00:32:10.060 --> 00:32:11.795 align:middle line:90%
do you?

00:32:11.795 --> 00:32:13.006 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:32:13.006 --> 00:32:15.130 align:middle line:84%
>>RADOS: First of all, you
would need to have idea.

00:32:15.130 --> 00:32:16.280 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And a
decision, a commitment.

00:32:16.280 --> 00:32:17.160 align:middle line:90%
>>RADOS: Idea.

00:32:17.160 --> 00:32:20.520 align:middle line:84%
And then from idea,
immediately desire comes.

00:32:20.520 --> 00:32:21.764 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:32:21.764 --> 00:32:23.930 align:middle line:84%
>>RADOS: But you see, you
have to understand desire.

00:32:23.930 --> 00:32:25.680 align:middle line:84%
Desire can be positive,
can be negative.

00:32:25.680 --> 00:32:25.910 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:32:25.910 --> 00:32:27.410 align:middle line:84%
And talk about
that a little bit.

00:32:27.410 --> 00:32:28.600 align:middle line:90%
>>RADOS: So you can say, OK.

00:32:28.600 --> 00:32:30.410 align:middle line:84%
I would like to
attain this, I would

00:32:30.410 --> 00:32:32.010 align:middle line:90%
like to achieve this idea.

00:32:32.010 --> 00:32:35.230 align:middle line:84%
Or your desire might be,
I will never get that.

00:32:35.230 --> 00:32:36.567 align:middle line:90%
Meaning it's a desire.

00:32:36.567 --> 00:32:38.150 align:middle line:84%
You're going to get
that at one point,

00:32:38.150 --> 00:32:40.890 align:middle line:90%
but you are rejecting the mind.

00:32:40.890 --> 00:32:45.810 align:middle line:84%
And mind is there in sub level
saying, oh, we can accept,

00:32:45.810 --> 00:32:46.690 align:middle line:90%
we can reject.

00:32:46.690 --> 00:32:49.750 align:middle line:84%
But either way, we
will get what we want.

00:32:49.750 --> 00:32:52.760 align:middle line:90%
So you have to have idea.

00:32:52.760 --> 00:32:53.950 align:middle line:90%
You have to have a desire.

00:32:53.950 --> 00:32:56.180 align:middle line:84%
And then you have
to make an effort.

00:32:56.180 --> 00:32:59.370 align:middle line:84%
You have to be motivated
to go through that effort

00:32:59.370 --> 00:33:00.510 align:middle line:90%
in order to attain it.

00:33:00.510 --> 00:33:02.660 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And the desire
is the motivation.

00:33:02.660 --> 00:33:03.450 align:middle line:90%
>>RADOS: Exactly.

00:33:03.450 --> 00:33:07.057 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And that's a missing
element a lot in new age work.

00:33:07.057 --> 00:33:08.890 align:middle line:84%
>>RADOS: But new age
work is saying, oh, you

00:33:08.890 --> 00:33:11.355 align:middle line:84%
have to believe that
it will be attainable.

00:33:11.355 --> 00:33:13.080 align:middle line:90%
No, you don't.

00:33:13.080 --> 00:33:14.830 align:middle line:90%
You know, the mind is a belief.

00:33:14.830 --> 00:33:18.080 align:middle line:84%
So now you are talking
about confirming the mind

00:33:18.080 --> 00:33:19.241 align:middle line:90%
with more mind.

00:33:19.241 --> 00:33:19.740 align:middle line:90%
No.

00:33:19.740 --> 00:33:21.280 align:middle line:90%
The mind is a belief.

00:33:21.280 --> 00:33:24.340 align:middle line:84%
Nothing else believe
in separated reality.

00:33:24.340 --> 00:33:25.630 align:middle line:90%
That's what mind is.

00:33:25.630 --> 00:33:26.880 align:middle line:90%
It's not reality.

00:33:26.880 --> 00:33:27.630 align:middle line:90%
It's a separation.

00:33:27.630 --> 00:33:30.350 align:middle line:84%
It's a bubble outside of
the wholeness, outside

00:33:30.350 --> 00:33:31.890 align:middle line:90%
of existence.

00:33:31.890 --> 00:33:32.655 align:middle line:90%
What's the bubble?

00:33:32.655 --> 00:33:33.850 align:middle line:90%
It's just illusion.

00:33:33.850 --> 00:33:36.650 align:middle line:84%
It's your thinking about
something that happened,

00:33:36.650 --> 00:33:41.130 align:middle line:84%
unresolved, unlived, the memory
stored somewhere in your past.

00:33:41.130 --> 00:33:43.280 align:middle line:90%
Or projected future.

00:33:43.280 --> 00:33:44.350 align:middle line:90%
That's the bubble.

00:33:44.350 --> 00:33:46.500 align:middle line:84%
While their life is
happening right now,

00:33:46.500 --> 00:33:49.230 align:middle line:84%
your consciousness is right now,
your awareness is right now,

00:33:49.230 --> 00:33:50.330 align:middle line:90%
God is right now.

00:33:50.330 --> 00:33:53.960 align:middle line:84%
We are missing that all the time
when we are locked in our mind,

00:33:53.960 --> 00:33:56.830 align:middle line:84%
believing that we are
our mind, believing

00:33:56.830 --> 00:33:58.700 align:middle line:90%
that we are our thoughts.

00:33:58.700 --> 00:34:01.490 align:middle line:84%
When you disconnect
yourself from that belief,

00:34:01.490 --> 00:34:05.430 align:middle line:84%
you immediately then desire
to attain the unattainable.

00:34:05.430 --> 00:34:07.650 align:middle line:90%
But the desire is good.

00:34:07.650 --> 00:34:08.359 align:middle line:90%
That's the point.

00:34:08.359 --> 00:34:10.691 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Desire is the fuel
for creation of all things.

00:34:10.691 --> 00:34:13.050 align:middle line:84%
>>RADOS: Then you desire,
and then you use an effort,

00:34:13.050 --> 00:34:15.837 align:middle line:84%
and then you are motivated,
and you go to discover that.

00:34:15.837 --> 00:34:17.670 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Now that's
positive use of desire.

00:34:17.670 --> 00:34:18.586 align:middle line:90%
>>RADOS: That's right.

00:34:18.586 --> 00:34:20.659 align:middle line:84%
But it can be
another mind attempt

00:34:20.659 --> 00:34:23.239 align:middle line:84%
to sabotage your
effort to find yourself

00:34:23.239 --> 00:34:28.250 align:middle line:84%
if you continue doing that
effort without abandoning it.

00:34:28.250 --> 00:34:31.721 align:middle line:84%
You have to stop
using the effort.

00:34:31.721 --> 00:34:32.429 align:middle line:90%
You have to stop.

00:34:32.429 --> 00:34:33.803 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So you
use the effort--

00:34:33.803 --> 00:34:36.760 align:middle line:84%
>>RADOS: You use the
energy, and you relax.

00:34:36.760 --> 00:34:39.550 align:middle line:84%
You use the energy,
and you relax.

00:34:39.550 --> 00:34:43.250 align:middle line:84%
When you use the energy, move
that energy, then their energy

00:34:43.250 --> 00:34:46.120 align:middle line:84%
re-manifests itself the way
it needs to manifest itself.

00:34:46.120 --> 00:34:48.409 align:middle line:84%
Who are you to
control that energy?

00:34:48.409 --> 00:34:51.510 align:middle line:84%
If you try to control
it, you are in duality.

00:34:51.510 --> 00:34:54.190 align:middle line:84%
You never know the result.
Then you are in suffering.

00:34:54.190 --> 00:34:56.880 align:middle line:90%
Then you're in big surprise.

00:34:56.880 --> 00:34:59.050 align:middle line:90%
It might turn ugly at the end.

00:34:59.050 --> 00:35:00.660 align:middle line:90%
You never know.

00:35:00.660 --> 00:35:01.960 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Too much efforting.

00:35:01.960 --> 00:35:04.130 align:middle line:84%
>>RADOS: So when
you put an effort

00:35:04.130 --> 00:35:07.190 align:middle line:84%
and you give that
effort to the wholeness,

00:35:07.190 --> 00:35:09.960 align:middle line:84%
it will materialize
itself in a way,

00:35:09.960 --> 00:35:12.070 align:middle line:90%
if it needs to materialize.

00:35:12.070 --> 00:35:15.120 align:middle line:84%
It will manifest itself if
it needs to manifest itself.

00:35:15.120 --> 00:35:16.350 align:middle line:90%
And you are grateful.

00:35:16.350 --> 00:35:18.660 align:middle line:84%
When you are grateful
for that, you're

00:35:18.660 --> 00:35:20.580 align:middle line:90%
at peace with who you are.

00:35:20.580 --> 00:35:25.080 align:middle line:84%
And then creativity flows
because you become open, fluid.

00:35:25.080 --> 00:35:26.520 align:middle line:90%
You become that hollow bamboo.

00:35:26.520 --> 00:35:30.340 align:middle line:84%
You become no mind where you
can use the mind in order

00:35:30.340 --> 00:35:32.285 align:middle line:84%
to create, designate,
and communicate--

00:35:32.285 --> 00:35:33.430 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: As your servant.

00:35:33.430 --> 00:35:34.471 align:middle line:90%
>>RADOS: As your servant.

00:35:34.471 --> 00:35:35.660 align:middle line:90%
As your tool.

00:35:35.660 --> 00:35:37.820 align:middle line:90%
I'm not my car I'm driving.

00:35:37.820 --> 00:35:40.740 align:middle line:84%
I'm a driver of that
car, but I'm not driving.

00:35:40.740 --> 00:35:42.390 align:middle line:90%
I'm enjoying driving.

00:35:42.390 --> 00:35:43.980 align:middle line:90%
I am enjoying.

00:35:43.980 --> 00:35:45.830 align:middle line:90%
That's the whole purpose of it.

00:35:45.830 --> 00:35:48.080 align:middle line:90%
That's the whole point of it.

00:35:48.080 --> 00:35:50.760 align:middle line:84%
I'm not my pen, I'm
writing letter to you.

00:35:50.760 --> 00:35:52.955 align:middle line:90%
I'm not the message I'm writing.

00:35:52.955 --> 00:35:58.240 align:middle line:84%
I'm the movement of that pen,
and when expressing itself,

00:35:58.240 --> 00:35:59.070 align:middle line:90%
I'm expressing.

00:35:59.070 --> 00:36:02.351 align:middle line:84%
I'm educating myself through
writing you a letter.

00:36:02.351 --> 00:36:03.850 align:middle line:84%
And when I write
the letter, I don't

00:36:03.850 --> 00:36:05.766 align:middle line:84%
care how you're going
to perceive that letter.

00:36:05.766 --> 00:36:07.710 align:middle line:90%
And I don't care about pen.

00:36:07.710 --> 00:36:10.310 align:middle line:84%
I care as much that put it
on the place and say, OK.

00:36:10.310 --> 00:36:11.440 align:middle line:90%
Now it's safe.

00:36:11.440 --> 00:36:12.450 align:middle line:90%
Look after yourself.

00:36:12.450 --> 00:36:14.790 align:middle line:84%
If you want to destroy
yourself, do it.

00:36:14.790 --> 00:36:17.490 align:middle line:84%
If you want to disappear for
my vision, that's up to you.

00:36:17.490 --> 00:36:21.370 align:middle line:84%
If you take my letter with
offense or with gratitude,

00:36:21.370 --> 00:36:22.360 align:middle line:90%
that's your decision.

00:36:22.360 --> 00:36:23.480 align:middle line:90%
Not mine.

00:36:23.480 --> 00:36:27.280 align:middle line:84%
But I did the best
explaining my way.

00:36:27.280 --> 00:36:29.080 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Let's
talk about then--

00:36:29.080 --> 00:36:30.580 align:middle line:84%
unless you already
have and I didn't

00:36:30.580 --> 00:36:34.000 align:middle line:84%
get it-- the way in which
desire can negatively

00:36:34.000 --> 00:36:35.670 align:middle line:90%
impact our efforts.

00:36:35.670 --> 00:36:38.230 align:middle line:84%
>>RADOS: Desire can
negatively impact our effort

00:36:38.230 --> 00:36:41.340 align:middle line:84%
when you desire
to have yourself,

00:36:41.340 --> 00:36:45.790 align:middle line:84%
and then you desire to have that
self and achieving that self.

00:36:45.790 --> 00:36:47.480 align:middle line:90%
And then your ego becomes big.

00:36:47.480 --> 00:36:50.050 align:middle line:90%


00:36:50.050 --> 00:36:52.660 align:middle line:84%
When I was kid, I used
to say to my grandma,

00:36:52.660 --> 00:36:55.455 align:middle line:84%
I can be a president of
United States of America.

00:36:55.455 --> 00:36:56.850 align:middle line:90%
She said, no, you cannot.

00:36:56.850 --> 00:36:58.440 align:middle line:90%
I said, yes, I can.

00:36:58.440 --> 00:36:59.710 align:middle line:90%
You see?

00:36:59.710 --> 00:37:03.160 align:middle line:84%
Maybe from your perspective, I
cannot do that in this reality.

00:37:03.160 --> 00:37:04.800 align:middle line:90%
But in another reality, I can.

00:37:04.800 --> 00:37:08.941 align:middle line:84%
I can be born in the
family where I will

00:37:08.941 --> 00:37:10.930 align:middle line:90%
be prepared to be president.

00:37:10.930 --> 00:37:13.520 align:middle line:84%
Because presidents
are not chosen.

00:37:13.520 --> 00:37:15.360 align:middle line:90%
They're selected.

00:37:15.360 --> 00:37:17.060 align:middle line:84%
Because society
needs them in order

00:37:17.060 --> 00:37:20.890 align:middle line:84%
to represent that
controlled structure.

00:37:20.890 --> 00:37:22.041 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Very much so.

00:37:22.041 --> 00:37:22.540 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:37:22.540 --> 00:37:26.460 align:middle line:84%
So now I'm going to use your
art as the anchor point moving

00:37:26.460 --> 00:37:27.470 align:middle line:90%
through consciousness.

00:37:27.470 --> 00:37:33.920 align:middle line:84%
So you create this geometry,
this beautiful sacred geometry.

00:37:33.920 --> 00:37:36.710 align:middle line:84%
Why and how did that
start expressing itself?

00:37:36.710 --> 00:37:39.900 align:middle line:84%
And what was actually
flowing through you?

00:37:39.900 --> 00:37:43.580 align:middle line:84%
And then what would
you like to feel

00:37:43.580 --> 00:37:45.880 align:middle line:90%
that is giving to humanity?

00:37:45.880 --> 00:37:51.560 align:middle line:84%
>>RADOS: When I started painting
while I was four or five years,

00:37:51.560 --> 00:37:54.860 align:middle line:84%
I only drew triangles
and circles and squares

00:37:54.860 --> 00:37:56.710 align:middle line:90%
and this and that.

00:37:56.710 --> 00:37:57.210 align:middle line:90%
Always.

00:37:57.210 --> 00:37:59.981 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Most kids just
go to sacred geometry.

00:37:59.981 --> 00:38:01.480 align:middle line:84%
>>RADOS: While
everyone was studying

00:38:01.480 --> 00:38:06.892 align:middle line:84%
math, mathematics, equations,
I drew something else out

00:38:06.892 --> 00:38:08.460 align:middle line:90%
of the blue.

00:38:08.460 --> 00:38:14.640 align:middle line:84%
So later on, I went into
phantasmagoria, my dreams.

00:38:14.640 --> 00:38:18.920 align:middle line:84%
Going through that process
of going through the mind.

00:38:18.920 --> 00:38:20.490 align:middle line:84%
Because when you go
through the mind,

00:38:20.490 --> 00:38:22.781 align:middle line:84%
what you're going to find
when you go through the mind,

00:38:22.781 --> 00:38:25.600 align:middle line:84%
you're going to find
positive, negative.

00:38:25.600 --> 00:38:27.800 align:middle line:84%
And the tension between
positive and negative

00:38:27.800 --> 00:38:32.620 align:middle line:84%
and all other
things in that space

00:38:32.620 --> 00:38:35.850 align:middle line:84%
between positive
and negative, clash

00:38:35.850 --> 00:38:43.100 align:middle line:84%
of different elements, different
poles and the extremes.

00:38:43.100 --> 00:38:47.320 align:middle line:84%
And then when you come
beyond the mind-- I mean,

00:38:47.320 --> 00:38:48.700 align:middle line:90%
you don't come beyond the mind.

00:38:48.700 --> 00:38:52.410 align:middle line:84%
The mind drops itself and
you are already beyond.

00:38:52.410 --> 00:38:56.060 align:middle line:84%
Then the only way that
you can be creative

00:38:56.060 --> 00:38:59.511 align:middle line:84%
is to use something more
balanced, more significant

00:38:59.511 --> 00:39:00.760 align:middle line:90%
that relates to consciousness.

00:39:00.760 --> 00:39:06.560 align:middle line:90%


00:39:06.560 --> 00:39:13.190 align:middle line:84%
As one focus for you to retain
the level of consciousness,

00:39:13.190 --> 00:39:17.830 align:middle line:84%
and as a portal for
someone else to attain

00:39:17.830 --> 00:39:23.110 align:middle line:84%
that level of consciousness
if they are drawn into it.

00:39:23.110 --> 00:39:27.410 align:middle line:84%
So sacred geometry is
the way not to explain

00:39:27.410 --> 00:39:28.910 align:middle line:90%
how the universe works.

00:39:28.910 --> 00:39:30.610 align:middle line:84%
All those people
trying to explain

00:39:30.610 --> 00:39:33.490 align:middle line:84%
and using equations
and mathematics,

00:39:33.490 --> 00:39:35.920 align:middle line:84%
it's one way of explaining,
but it's not the whole.

00:39:35.920 --> 00:39:39.610 align:middle line:84%
Sacred geometry is the
consciousness itself.

00:39:39.610 --> 00:39:41.060 align:middle line:84%
So when you will
become conscious,

00:39:41.060 --> 00:39:45.660 align:middle line:84%
then you use the sacred geometry
without your desire to use it.

00:39:45.660 --> 00:39:49.780 align:middle line:84%
I cannot create phantasmagoric
dreams and nightmares anymore.

00:39:49.780 --> 00:39:55.240 align:middle line:84%
I cannot do that because I'm
not locked in my mind anymore.

00:39:55.240 --> 00:39:56.680 align:middle line:90%
I'm beyond the mind.

00:39:56.680 --> 00:39:59.500 align:middle line:84%
So when I'm beyond the
mind, what else to do?

00:39:59.500 --> 00:40:01.460 align:middle line:90%
Just to balance everything.

00:40:01.460 --> 00:40:04.520 align:middle line:84%
So creating sacred
geometry is the way off

00:40:04.520 --> 00:40:08.260 align:middle line:84%
expressing my consciousness
as a reference point,

00:40:08.260 --> 00:40:10.730 align:middle line:84%
and also as a portal
for someone else

00:40:10.730 --> 00:40:12.970 align:middle line:84%
to find that reference
point of themselves,

00:40:12.970 --> 00:40:15.280 align:middle line:90%
if they wish and desire.

00:40:15.280 --> 00:40:15.860 align:middle line:90%
You see?

00:40:15.860 --> 00:40:20.750 align:middle line:84%
So sacred geometry does
not contain the energy.

00:40:20.750 --> 00:40:25.210 align:middle line:84%
But sacred geometry acts as a
portal for your consciousness

00:40:25.210 --> 00:40:27.766 align:middle line:84%
to recognize
itself, to recognize

00:40:27.766 --> 00:40:28.890 align:middle line:90%
that energy inside ourself.

00:40:28.890 --> 00:40:32.830 align:middle line:10%
And use that energy creatively
in order to expand itself.

00:40:32.830 --> 00:40:36.460 align:middle line:10%
Not to rule the reality or
change the reality outside,

00:40:36.460 --> 00:40:40.215 align:middle line:10%
because reality's changing
itself all the time without you

00:40:40.215 --> 00:40:41.840 align:middle line:10%
being involved in it.

00:40:41.840 --> 00:40:44.490 align:middle line:10%
You are changing the
perception of who you are,

00:40:44.490 --> 00:40:48.110 align:middle line:10%
coming much closer to
the center of your being.

00:40:48.110 --> 00:40:49.520 align:middle line:90%
Realizing your illusions.

00:40:49.520 --> 00:40:53.080 align:middle line:84%
Realizing your dreams and your
fantasies, your attachments,

00:40:53.080 --> 00:40:54.220 align:middle line:90%
your identifications.

00:40:54.220 --> 00:40:57.550 align:middle line:84%
Going through the mind
and finally allowing mind

00:40:57.550 --> 00:41:02.710 align:middle line:84%
to drop itself and submit itself
to you to be used as a tool.

00:41:02.710 --> 00:41:04.450 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So if you
don't mind me asking,

00:41:04.450 --> 00:41:07.230 align:middle line:84%
very kind of personally--
not your experience

00:41:07.230 --> 00:41:10.650 align:middle line:84%
but perhaps the experience of
others and even your child,

00:41:10.650 --> 00:41:12.800 align:middle line:84%
Kai-- when you're
talking about going

00:41:12.800 --> 00:41:16.250 align:middle line:84%
through the experience
of the geometrical--

00:41:16.250 --> 00:41:18.730 align:middle line:84%
the sacred geometrical
forms or the yantras,

00:41:18.730 --> 00:41:21.830 align:middle line:84%
what kind of experiences
are people having?

00:41:21.830 --> 00:41:23.144 align:middle line:90%
>>RADOS: OK.

00:41:23.144 --> 00:41:23.810 align:middle line:90%
Sacred geometry.

00:41:23.810 --> 00:41:25.310 align:middle line:84%
We just look at the
sacred geometry.

00:41:25.310 --> 00:41:27.820 align:middle line:90%


00:41:27.820 --> 00:41:30.440 align:middle line:90%
Architectural sacred geometry.

00:41:30.440 --> 00:41:34.070 align:middle line:84%
If you was a
conscious person, you

00:41:34.070 --> 00:41:38.000 align:middle line:84%
want to create
sacred geometry, you

00:41:38.000 --> 00:41:40.950 align:middle line:84%
have to be in a certain
level of consciousness

00:41:40.950 --> 00:41:44.750 align:middle line:84%
in order to represent
certain geometrical patterns

00:41:44.750 --> 00:41:46.839 align:middle line:90%
and shapes.

00:41:46.839 --> 00:41:47.380 align:middle line:90%
So I knew it.

00:41:47.380 --> 00:41:51.950 align:middle line:84%
But you have to start
from nothing, you see?

00:41:51.950 --> 00:41:52.890 align:middle line:90%
It's not an idea.

00:41:52.890 --> 00:41:54.060 align:middle line:90%
It's an urge.

00:41:54.060 --> 00:41:55.590 align:middle line:84%
With an idea,
you're in your mind.

00:41:55.590 --> 00:41:57.730 align:middle line:90%
Mind means idea.

00:41:57.730 --> 00:42:01.290 align:middle line:84%
Ideas that are different
than what is at the moment.

00:42:01.290 --> 00:42:03.930 align:middle line:84%
What is at the
moment is impulse.

00:42:03.930 --> 00:42:06.560 align:middle line:90%
It's a drive from the wholeness.

00:42:06.560 --> 00:42:11.880 align:middle line:84%
It's the invitation to move the
energy for the greatest good.

00:42:11.880 --> 00:42:13.180 align:middle line:90%
What's the greatest good?

00:42:13.180 --> 00:42:14.340 align:middle line:90%
Expansion.

00:42:14.340 --> 00:42:17.220 align:middle line:84%
Not expansion of and
progression of the society

00:42:17.220 --> 00:42:20.210 align:middle line:84%
and the material order or
whatever, [INAUDIBLE], but

00:42:20.210 --> 00:42:22.430 align:middle line:90%
of your consciousness.

00:42:22.430 --> 00:42:26.840 align:middle line:84%
So that input creates
certain portal inside of you

00:42:26.840 --> 00:42:28.874 align:middle line:84%
where that expression
will happen

00:42:28.874 --> 00:42:30.790 align:middle line:84%
and the manifestation
of that sacred geometry.

00:42:30.790 --> 00:42:34.450 align:middle line:84%
But first from
nothingness comes the dot.

00:42:34.450 --> 00:42:37.530 align:middle line:84%
So the consciousness
is ceding itself

00:42:37.530 --> 00:42:40.060 align:middle line:84%
in that nothingness
and that emptiness.

00:42:40.060 --> 00:42:43.290 align:middle line:84%
And from that consciousness,
containing all,

00:42:43.290 --> 00:42:46.250 align:middle line:84%
contains all the forms, all
the shapes, all the colors,

00:42:46.250 --> 00:42:48.670 align:middle line:84%
that dot contains
everything that is.

00:42:48.670 --> 00:42:51.440 align:middle line:90%
Consciousness contained that.

00:42:51.440 --> 00:42:54.670 align:middle line:84%
Now you have to be
motivated and excited

00:42:54.670 --> 00:42:57.430 align:middle line:84%
and use the effort to
create a circle around.

00:42:57.430 --> 00:42:59.230 align:middle line:90%
You are enclosing that.

00:42:59.230 --> 00:43:03.420 align:middle line:84%
But if you're
enclosing that dot,

00:43:03.420 --> 00:43:07.710 align:middle line:84%
you're making actually,
immediately, duality.

00:43:07.710 --> 00:43:10.110 align:middle line:84%
Because one dot
creating a circle-- so

00:43:10.110 --> 00:43:12.100 align:middle line:90%
it's a bubble in the bubble.

00:43:12.100 --> 00:43:13.260 align:middle line:90%
You understand that?

00:43:13.260 --> 00:43:18.430 align:middle line:84%
It's a circle in the circle
creating apparent duality,

00:43:18.430 --> 00:43:20.240 align:middle line:90%
apparent self.

00:43:20.240 --> 00:43:22.170 align:middle line:84%
That apparent self
is just a reflection.

00:43:22.170 --> 00:43:23.070 align:middle line:90%
It's a hologram.

00:43:23.070 --> 00:43:27.820 align:middle line:84%
So I have to be aware of myself
if I want to know who I am,

00:43:27.820 --> 00:43:28.320 align:middle line:90%
you see?

00:43:28.320 --> 00:43:30.890 align:middle line:84%
I have to be conscious
of my consciousness.

00:43:30.890 --> 00:43:34.742 align:middle line:84%
If I'm just conscious,
what to refer with?

00:43:34.742 --> 00:43:35.950 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: No reference point.

00:43:35.950 --> 00:43:37.910 align:middle line:84%
>>RADOS: No reference
point, you see?

00:43:37.910 --> 00:43:41.060 align:middle line:84%
So when you create
that circle, then there

00:43:41.060 --> 00:43:42.960 align:middle line:84%
are infinite points
on that circle.

00:43:42.960 --> 00:43:46.080 align:middle line:84%
There is one dot, but there are
infinite dots on that circle.

00:43:46.080 --> 00:43:50.010 align:middle line:10%
So every single dot is a
reflection of that first dot.

00:43:50.010 --> 00:43:51.520 align:middle line:10%
It appears, disappears.

00:43:51.520 --> 00:43:54.242 align:middle line:10%
That's your cellular
structure in your body.

00:43:54.242 --> 00:43:56.350 align:middle line:10%
I came from one cell.

00:43:56.350 --> 00:43:58.780 align:middle line:84%
Trillions of other cells
were born out of it.

00:43:58.780 --> 00:44:03.420 align:middle line:84%
So every single cell of your
body is in close relation

00:44:03.420 --> 00:44:07.340 align:middle line:84%
with the primordial self
containing the whole.

00:44:07.340 --> 00:44:10.140 align:middle line:84%
Because your cell is no
different than my cell.

00:44:10.140 --> 00:44:12.200 align:middle line:84%
Different information,
different vibration

00:44:12.200 --> 00:44:15.395 align:middle line:90%
but containing the whole.

00:44:15.395 --> 00:44:18.730 align:middle line:84%
Any other cell in the
infinite universe is the same.

00:44:18.730 --> 00:44:19.990 align:middle line:90%
It's the one cell.

00:44:19.990 --> 00:44:21.800 align:middle line:84%
So what we see is
just the appearance

00:44:21.800 --> 00:44:24.430 align:middle line:84%
of the same dot appearing
and disappearing,

00:44:24.430 --> 00:44:26.910 align:middle line:84%
giving the appearance
of solidity.

00:44:26.910 --> 00:44:29.320 align:middle line:84%
When that appearance
of solidity happens,

00:44:29.320 --> 00:44:31.660 align:middle line:84%
then you start drawing
the forms there.

00:44:31.660 --> 00:44:35.030 align:middle line:84%
From one dot to the other and
triangles and forms and shapes

00:44:35.030 --> 00:44:35.980 align:middle line:90%
and all of that.

00:44:35.980 --> 00:44:38.464 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Which becomes,
then, a very mathematical--

00:44:38.464 --> 00:44:39.380 align:middle line:90%
>>RADOS: Mathematical.

00:44:39.380 --> 00:44:44.540 align:middle line:84%
And you give emotions into it
by painting it with colors.

00:44:44.540 --> 00:44:48.178 align:middle line:90%
Colors are linked with emotions.

00:44:48.178 --> 00:44:50.640 align:middle line:84%
One person came to my
studio, saw my paintings

00:44:50.640 --> 00:44:52.292 align:middle line:90%
and said to his wife, run!

00:44:52.292 --> 00:44:53.980 align:middle line:90%
Run!

00:44:53.980 --> 00:44:56.580 align:middle line:84%
They were running
through the halls.

00:44:56.580 --> 00:45:00.093 align:middle line:84%
And while running she
said, why are we running?

00:45:00.093 --> 00:45:03.250 align:middle line:84%
And he said, we are
running against colors.

00:45:03.250 --> 00:45:06.080 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHTER]

00:45:06.080 --> 00:45:08.570 align:middle line:84%
They were very tight
English people, so--

00:45:08.570 --> 00:45:09.639 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHTER]

00:45:09.639 --> 00:45:11.430 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: I spent a
lot of time in England.

00:45:11.430 --> 00:45:13.340 align:middle line:90%
>>RADOS: Colors brings emotions.

00:45:13.340 --> 00:45:14.350 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:45:14.350 --> 00:45:14.930 align:middle line:90%
Absolutely.

00:45:14.930 --> 00:45:16.560 align:middle line:84%
>>RADOS: Disturbing color,
disturbing emotions.

00:45:16.560 --> 00:45:18.170 align:middle line:84%
So you wear your
clothes depending

00:45:18.170 --> 00:45:21.230 align:middle line:84%
on what kind of
emotions are surfacing

00:45:21.230 --> 00:45:22.860 align:middle line:90%
at that moment in your life.

00:45:22.860 --> 00:45:24.610 align:middle line:84%
You might say, oh, I'm
not for blue today,

00:45:24.610 --> 00:45:27.420 align:middle line:84%
but I'm for red because I'm
very active emotionally.

00:45:27.420 --> 00:45:28.650 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: It's a frequency.

00:45:28.650 --> 00:45:30.060 align:middle line:90%
>>RADOS: It's a frequency.

00:45:30.060 --> 00:45:35.040 align:middle line:84%
So anyways, you put the
emotions into sacred geometry.

00:45:35.040 --> 00:45:41.620 align:middle line:84%
But you see, variations of
colors are seen as emotions.

00:45:41.620 --> 00:45:44.540 align:middle line:84%
Purity of colors are
seen as feelings.

00:45:44.540 --> 00:45:46.727 align:middle line:84%
There's a difference
between feeling and emotion.

00:45:46.727 --> 00:45:47.310 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:45:47.310 --> 00:45:48.960 align:middle line:90%
And please explain this.

00:45:48.960 --> 00:45:50.460 align:middle line:84%
>>RADOS: Emotions
are nothing else

00:45:50.460 --> 00:45:57.150 align:middle line:84%
than the chemical reactions
of certain beliefs interpreted

00:45:57.150 --> 00:45:59.490 align:middle line:90%
by the mind as feeling.

00:45:59.490 --> 00:46:02.410 align:middle line:84%
So emotion of love can
be emotion of hate,

00:46:02.410 --> 00:46:04.040 align:middle line:90%
but it's not real love.

00:46:04.040 --> 00:46:06.832 align:middle line:90%
Real love is real feeling.

00:46:06.832 --> 00:46:07.790 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Feeling, yes.

00:46:07.790 --> 00:46:10.410 align:middle line:84%
>>RADOS: What is love
as a real feeling?

00:46:10.410 --> 00:46:14.780 align:middle line:84%
And there is only one
emotion out of that one-- no.

00:46:14.780 --> 00:46:16.540 align:middle line:90%
There's only one feeling.

00:46:16.540 --> 00:46:18.680 align:middle line:84%
There are infinite
number of emotions.

00:46:18.680 --> 00:46:21.850 align:middle line:84%
What comes out of
that one feeling?

00:46:21.850 --> 00:46:23.490 align:middle line:90%
All other feelings.

00:46:23.490 --> 00:46:25.770 align:middle line:90%
One feeling is called love.

00:46:25.770 --> 00:46:29.700 align:middle line:84%
Out of that love comes
gratitude, trust, peace,

00:46:29.700 --> 00:46:34.390 align:middle line:90%
tranquility, bliss, compassion.

00:46:34.390 --> 00:46:36.650 align:middle line:90%
So that feeling is love.

00:46:36.650 --> 00:46:39.980 align:middle line:90%
But love is equal to life.

00:46:39.980 --> 00:46:44.010 align:middle line:84%
And what life is, what love is--
I mean, it's not sentimental.

00:46:44.010 --> 00:46:46.160 align:middle line:84%
It's not, I love
you, you love me.

00:46:46.160 --> 00:46:48.530 align:middle line:84%
It's ultimate
acceptance of all that

00:46:48.530 --> 00:46:51.130 align:middle line:90%
is right now in this moment.

00:46:51.130 --> 00:46:55.000 align:middle line:84%
Ultimate acceptance of
yourself the way you are.

00:46:55.000 --> 00:46:56.820 align:middle line:90%
But you don't know who you are.

00:46:56.820 --> 00:47:00.820 align:middle line:90%
But you are aware that you are.

00:47:00.820 --> 00:47:02.260 align:middle line:90%
You are aware that you are.

00:47:02.260 --> 00:47:05.390 align:middle line:84%
That awareness is the
center of the universe.

00:47:05.390 --> 00:47:08.370 align:middle line:90%
That awareness is right now.

00:47:08.370 --> 00:47:12.760 align:middle line:84%
So from that point, you
will never be the same.

00:47:12.760 --> 00:47:14.039 align:middle line:90%
Everything's changed.

00:47:14.039 --> 00:47:14.580 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: OK.

00:47:14.580 --> 00:47:16.822 align:middle line:84%
So now you project
these beautiful pieces--

00:47:16.822 --> 00:47:18.780 align:middle line:84%
>>RADOS: And you project
those beautiful images

00:47:18.780 --> 00:47:22.321 align:middle line:84%
so you understand
the point of now.

00:47:22.321 --> 00:47:22.820 align:middle line:90%
You see?

00:47:22.820 --> 00:47:27.120 align:middle line:90%
You understand what balance is.

00:47:27.120 --> 00:47:30.720 align:middle line:84%
Balance is not giving
priorities to something

00:47:30.720 --> 00:47:32.165 align:middle line:90%
that is outside of you.

00:47:32.165 --> 00:47:34.020 align:middle line:90%
The thoughts are outside of you.

00:47:34.020 --> 00:47:37.790 align:middle line:84%
Ideas, theories, beliefs,
dogma, this and that.

00:47:37.790 --> 00:47:43.000 align:middle line:84%
So you surrender everything
that is in your mind.

00:47:43.000 --> 00:47:45.300 align:middle line:84%
You surrender your
mind to nothing.

00:47:45.300 --> 00:47:47.720 align:middle line:84%
And you relax, and you
find yourself there

00:47:47.720 --> 00:47:51.380 align:middle line:84%
being aware of oneself from
that aspect, from that portal.

00:47:51.380 --> 00:47:57.910 align:middle line:84%
So the sacred geometry acts as
a portal to recognize yourself,

00:47:57.910 --> 00:47:59.200 align:middle line:90%
to mirror yourself.

00:47:59.200 --> 00:48:01.530 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And that is
when you're creating,

00:48:01.530 --> 00:48:03.777 align:middle line:84%
I'm assuming you're
creating for yourself.

00:48:03.777 --> 00:48:05.610 align:middle line:84%
>>RADOS: No, I don't
create for anyone else.

00:48:05.610 --> 00:48:06.400 align:middle line:90%
Just for myself.

00:48:06.400 --> 00:48:07.066 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:48:07.066 --> 00:48:09.340 align:middle line:84%
And so by other people
experiencing it--

00:48:09.340 --> 00:48:11.140 align:middle line:84%
>>RADOS: So I don't
create it for myself.

00:48:11.140 --> 00:48:15.710 align:middle line:84%
Actually I just don't
have any idea to create.

00:48:15.710 --> 00:48:16.662 align:middle line:90%
It just happens.

00:48:16.662 --> 00:48:18.870 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So once you create
these beautiful pieces--

00:48:18.870 --> 00:48:19.786 align:middle line:90%
and they're out there.

00:48:19.786 --> 00:48:21.840 align:middle line:84%
People can access them
now in a variety of ways.

00:48:21.840 --> 00:48:22.600 align:middle line:90%
>>RADOS: They can access.

00:48:22.600 --> 00:48:23.183 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:48:23.183 --> 00:48:24.860 align:middle line:84%
>>RADOS: They have
to look at the dot.

00:48:24.860 --> 00:48:25.860 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: In the center.

00:48:25.860 --> 00:48:26.990 align:middle line:90%
>>RADOS: In the center.

00:48:26.990 --> 00:48:27.850 align:middle line:90%
That's all.

00:48:27.850 --> 00:48:29.896 align:middle line:84%
That's the second
geometry yantra.

00:48:29.896 --> 00:48:31.395 align:middle line:84%
Now it becomes
sacred geometry-- now

00:48:31.395 --> 00:48:33.740 align:middle line:84%
it's sacred geometry
representing something.

00:48:33.740 --> 00:48:36.500 align:middle line:84%
They're representing my
state of consciousness, OK?

00:48:36.500 --> 00:48:38.700 align:middle line:90%
It can act as a portal.

00:48:38.700 --> 00:48:40.490 align:middle line:84%
But when you start
to meditating on it,

00:48:40.490 --> 00:48:44.070 align:middle line:84%
when you use that
portal, you activate

00:48:44.070 --> 00:48:47.050 align:middle line:84%
the-- you activate
the sacred geometry,

00:48:47.050 --> 00:48:49.300 align:middle line:84%
and that sacred
geometry becomes yantra.

00:48:49.300 --> 00:48:53.490 align:middle line:84%
And yantra means a machine,
a device, a portal.

00:48:53.490 --> 00:49:00.090 align:middle line:84%
Now you can use that machine in
order to attain unattainable.

00:49:00.090 --> 00:49:01.740 align:middle line:90%
And then looking at the dot.

00:49:01.740 --> 00:49:05.600 align:middle line:84%
You look at a dot for 10,
15 minutes, 20 minutes

00:49:05.600 --> 00:49:07.760 align:middle line:84%
without blinking,
if you can try that.

00:49:07.760 --> 00:49:09.930 align:middle line:84%
You're focusing
your consciousness.

00:49:09.930 --> 00:49:13.280 align:middle line:84%
You're focusing your whole
attention to the dot.

00:49:13.280 --> 00:49:17.520 align:middle line:84%
The dot will reveal itself
because it contains the whole.

00:49:17.520 --> 00:49:19.810 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: It's pretty trippy
what happens to the mind.

00:49:19.810 --> 00:49:21.893 align:middle line:84%
>>RADOS: Because mind would
like to wander around.

00:49:21.893 --> 00:49:26.100 align:middle line:84%
Mind would like to go like a fly
from this place to that place

00:49:26.100 --> 00:49:27.750 align:middle line:90%
and explore this, explore that.

00:49:27.750 --> 00:49:31.140 align:middle line:84%
For just shortly, I don't want
to have a full experience, just

00:49:31.140 --> 00:49:32.100 align:middle line:90%
glimpse of it.

00:49:32.100 --> 00:49:33.920 align:middle line:90%
Let's go and get drunk here.

00:49:33.920 --> 00:49:36.930 align:middle line:84%
Let's go and get
socially active here.

00:49:36.930 --> 00:49:37.620 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:49:37.620 --> 00:49:38.910 align:middle line:90%
But you're right.

00:49:38.910 --> 00:49:41.550 align:middle line:84%
When you go in and stay
with that center point,

00:49:41.550 --> 00:49:45.250 align:middle line:84%
it is amazing what
shows itself to you.

00:49:45.250 --> 00:49:47.400 align:middle line:84%
>>RADOS: And then if
you persist there,

00:49:47.400 --> 00:49:52.450 align:middle line:84%
if you were dedicated, if you
are in that process of focusing

00:49:52.450 --> 00:49:56.710 align:middle line:84%
your attention to that dot
without moving anywhere else,

00:49:56.710 --> 00:49:58.650 align:middle line:84%
your peripheral
vision will remember

00:49:58.650 --> 00:50:03.030 align:middle line:84%
all the lines and all shapes and
all the forms, all the colors.

00:50:03.030 --> 00:50:06.650 align:middle line:84%
There is that mind thinking
there, thinking and thinking

00:50:06.650 --> 00:50:10.030 align:middle line:84%
through the peripheral vision
while your consciousness is

00:50:10.030 --> 00:50:12.250 align:middle line:90%
there in the center.

00:50:12.250 --> 00:50:15.160 align:middle line:84%
That consciousness
like a laser light,

00:50:15.160 --> 00:50:19.040 align:middle line:84%
is penetrating the
thickness of your thinking,

00:50:19.040 --> 00:50:21.885 align:middle line:84%
trying to find the gap
between two thoughts.

00:50:21.885 --> 00:50:23.510 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: The gap
between the thoughts.

00:50:23.510 --> 00:50:24.010 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:50:24.010 --> 00:50:26.590 align:middle line:84%
>>RADOS: While the thoughts
are there and you witness them,

00:50:26.590 --> 00:50:27.640 align:middle line:90%
you see them.

00:50:27.640 --> 00:50:31.450 align:middle line:90%
But you don't act like them.

00:50:31.450 --> 00:50:33.750 align:middle line:84%
You don't identify
yourself with them.

00:50:33.750 --> 00:50:36.845 align:middle line:84%
You leave them to
wander around, to be

00:50:36.845 --> 00:50:39.290 align:middle line:90%
in that traffic of business.

00:50:39.290 --> 00:50:41.854 align:middle line:84%
You're focusing on
that, on that dot.

00:50:41.854 --> 00:50:43.270 align:middle line:84%
At one point, you
close your eyes.

00:50:43.270 --> 00:50:45.144 align:middle line:84%
You're going to know
when to close your eyes.

00:50:45.144 --> 00:50:47.800 align:middle line:84%
It's not like I'm--
it's enough of me.

00:50:47.800 --> 00:50:50.000 align:middle line:90%
I cannot stand it anymore.

00:50:50.000 --> 00:50:51.200 align:middle line:90%
It comes like invitation.

00:50:51.200 --> 00:50:53.840 align:middle line:84%
Now is the time, and
then you close your eyes.

00:50:53.840 --> 00:50:57.650 align:middle line:84%
And what happens is that image
will be there in your mind.

00:50:57.650 --> 00:50:59.820 align:middle line:84%
Now you're freezing
that image in your mind.

00:50:59.820 --> 00:51:03.060 align:middle line:84%
Your thoughts are stopping
and creating one image.

00:51:03.060 --> 00:51:05.490 align:middle line:84%
Now there is a distance
between you and that image.

00:51:05.490 --> 00:51:09.600 align:middle line:84%
You are seeing your mind now
for the first time, represented

00:51:09.600 --> 00:51:13.514 align:middle line:84%
in that image,
embedded in that mind.

00:51:13.514 --> 00:51:16.180 align:middle line:84%
And that image starts spinning--
depends on the sacred geometry.

00:51:16.180 --> 00:51:19.800 align:middle line:84%
Spinning, pulsating like a
cell is doing in our body.

00:51:19.800 --> 00:51:20.750 align:middle line:90%
And then, poof.

00:51:20.750 --> 00:51:21.787 align:middle line:90%
Just disappearing.

00:51:21.787 --> 00:51:22.870 align:middle line:90%
And then what do you find?

00:51:22.870 --> 00:51:25.200 align:middle line:90%
Nothing at the end.

00:51:25.200 --> 00:51:29.080 align:middle line:84%
The result of that
process is nothing.

00:51:29.080 --> 00:51:31.760 align:middle line:84%
That's what contains the
thoughts and the things.

00:51:31.760 --> 00:51:32.770 align:middle line:90%
You are present there.

00:51:32.770 --> 00:51:33.770 align:middle line:90%
You are aware.

00:51:33.770 --> 00:51:37.670 align:middle line:84%
And that's what peace
is, love is, life is,

00:51:37.670 --> 00:51:41.130 align:middle line:84%
trust, gratitude,
all of that together

00:51:41.130 --> 00:51:45.986 align:middle line:90%
in being aware that you are.

00:51:45.986 --> 00:51:47.360 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: None of
these questions

00:51:47.360 --> 00:51:49.340 align:middle line:84%
are what I had planned
on talking to you about.

00:51:49.340 --> 00:51:51.000 align:middle line:84%
But I told you
before we started,

00:51:51.000 --> 00:51:54.280 align:middle line:84%
I felt this conversation
would take its own direction.

00:51:54.280 --> 00:51:57.880 align:middle line:84%
And I love that we're
using art and your artwork

00:51:57.880 --> 00:52:00.790 align:middle line:84%
and your own journey
personally to have

00:52:00.790 --> 00:52:03.560 align:middle line:84%
this focal point through
which to understand

00:52:03.560 --> 00:52:04.450 align:middle line:90%
our consciousness.

00:52:04.450 --> 00:52:07.960 align:middle line:84%
And so now let's-- I mean, part
of me doesn't want to go back

00:52:07.960 --> 00:52:10.290 align:middle line:84%
to my little list of questions
here and say, well, now,

00:52:10.290 --> 00:52:11.380 align:middle line:84%
I read in your
book this and that.

00:52:11.380 --> 00:52:12.965 align:middle line:84%
>>RADOS: Hit me
with your question.

00:52:12.965 --> 00:52:14.210 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: I'll do a couple.

00:52:14.210 --> 00:52:17.670 align:middle line:84%
But I want to just finish one
little bit on the art part.

00:52:17.670 --> 00:52:22.820 align:middle line:84%
And that is when we're watching
our children create art,

00:52:22.820 --> 00:52:25.340 align:middle line:84%
we know art's no longer
encouraged in schools.

00:52:25.340 --> 00:52:26.720 align:middle line:84%
If you want art,
the parents have

00:52:26.720 --> 00:52:28.470 align:middle line:84%
to provide that
environment for the child.

00:52:28.470 --> 00:52:29.136 align:middle line:90%
>>RADOS: Really?

00:52:29.136 --> 00:52:30.230 align:middle line:90%
That's in America?

00:52:30.230 --> 00:52:31.690 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: In America, yeah.

00:52:31.690 --> 00:52:33.989 align:middle line:84%
That was the first thing--
a couple decades ago,

00:52:33.989 --> 00:52:36.280 align:middle line:84%
they started cutting art out
of the budget immediately.

00:52:36.280 --> 00:52:38.370 align:middle line:90%
Art and music went kaput.

00:52:38.370 --> 00:52:40.330 align:middle line:84%
So we don't offer
that in our schools

00:52:40.330 --> 00:52:43.180 align:middle line:84%
now unless it's
a private school.

00:52:43.180 --> 00:52:45.260 align:middle line:90%
Or charter school of some kind.

00:52:45.260 --> 00:52:47.610 align:middle line:84%
>>RADOS: The same way as
the society will not provide

00:52:47.610 --> 00:52:48.850 align:middle line:90%
meditation classes for you.

00:52:48.850 --> 00:52:49.850 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Of course not.

00:52:49.850 --> 00:52:50.280 align:middle line:90%
No.

00:52:50.280 --> 00:52:50.880 align:middle line:90%
Of course not.

00:52:50.880 --> 00:52:52.400 align:middle line:90%
And you don't teach joy.

00:52:52.400 --> 00:52:53.970 align:middle line:84%
That's not part
of the curriculum.

00:52:53.970 --> 00:52:54.860 align:middle line:90%
It's creating robots.

00:52:54.860 --> 00:52:55.943 align:middle line:90%
>>RADOS: It's competition.

00:52:55.943 --> 00:52:58.150 align:middle line:90%
Creating competition and greed.

00:52:58.150 --> 00:53:00.690 align:middle line:84%
Greed is the quality
now, you know?

00:53:00.690 --> 00:53:02.200 align:middle line:90%
Seen as a quality.

00:53:02.200 --> 00:53:04.036 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And its
elevated in its status

00:53:04.036 --> 00:53:05.910 align:middle line:90%
in the media and such.

00:53:05.910 --> 00:53:08.580 align:middle line:84%
So when we see our little
children who are still,

00:53:08.580 --> 00:53:10.670 align:middle line:84%
if they're not on
some electrical device

00:53:10.670 --> 00:53:13.220 align:middle line:84%
and you give them a pen
and paper or a pencil,

00:53:13.220 --> 00:53:15.090 align:middle line:84%
crayons, whatever,
are going to start

00:53:15.090 --> 00:53:17.810 align:middle line:84%
doing their little stars
and their little triangles,

00:53:17.810 --> 00:53:19.030 align:middle line:90%
and so forth.

00:53:19.030 --> 00:53:22.272 align:middle line:84%
What can we do as parents
with them besides just maybe

00:53:22.272 --> 00:53:23.980 align:middle line:84%
give them the stuff
and leave them alone?

00:53:23.980 --> 00:53:25.877 align:middle line:84%
Or what can we learn
from them by what

00:53:25.877 --> 00:53:26.960 align:middle line:90%
their doodles are showing?

00:53:26.960 --> 00:53:28.280 align:middle line:90%
>>RADOS: Read those signs.

00:53:28.280 --> 00:53:34.080 align:middle line:84%
Because you see, sacred
geometry can imprison you

00:53:34.080 --> 00:53:37.230 align:middle line:90%
or it can liberate you.

00:53:37.230 --> 00:53:41.650 align:middle line:84%
You just choose the way you want
to use that sacred geometry.

00:53:41.650 --> 00:53:43.900 align:middle line:90%
Every sign on the street--

00:53:43.900 --> 00:53:44.620 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:53:44.620 --> 00:53:46.270 align:middle line:90%
That's all sacred geometry.

00:53:46.270 --> 00:53:49.980 align:middle line:84%
>>RADOS: It's controlling
you saying stop, move, left,

00:53:49.980 --> 00:53:51.570 align:middle line:90%
one way road.

00:53:51.570 --> 00:53:58.130 align:middle line:84%
Every sign you go by, you pass
by the store or window shop,

00:53:58.130 --> 00:54:00.490 align:middle line:90%
it's there inviting you.

00:54:00.490 --> 00:54:04.000 align:middle line:84%
It's using you, using
your own ability.

00:54:04.000 --> 00:54:08.580 align:middle line:84%
Using your sense of
guilt, using your passion,

00:54:08.580 --> 00:54:13.120 align:middle line:84%
using your beliefs and your
definition of who you are,

00:54:13.120 --> 00:54:16.740 align:middle line:84%
inviting you that
you can be used.

00:54:16.740 --> 00:54:19.610 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And you notice those
signs are always right angles.

00:54:19.610 --> 00:54:23.860 align:middle line:84%
You almost never see a
circular type of sign.

00:54:23.860 --> 00:54:26.030 align:middle line:84%
>>RADOS: That's why
I have this, you see.

00:54:26.030 --> 00:54:26.905 align:middle line:90%
You know what's that?

00:54:26.905 --> 00:54:28.215 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Flower of life, yeah.

00:54:28.215 --> 00:54:30.090 align:middle line:90%
What is that for you?

00:54:30.090 --> 00:54:31.890 align:middle line:90%
>>RADOS: What is that for me?

00:54:31.890 --> 00:54:35.150 align:middle line:84%
It's balance between
positive and negative.

00:54:35.150 --> 00:54:36.110 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: OK.

00:54:36.110 --> 00:54:37.234 align:middle line:90%
>>RADOS: That's what it is.

00:54:37.234 --> 00:54:39.895 align:middle line:90%
It's called the oneness, OK?

00:54:39.895 --> 00:54:42.170 align:middle line:90%
It's called flower of life.

00:54:42.170 --> 00:54:46.910 align:middle line:84%
We call it flower of life
because it represents flower.

00:54:46.910 --> 00:54:52.210 align:middle line:84%
But most of all, it represents
the fragrance of flower

00:54:52.210 --> 00:54:53.810 align:middle line:90%
because that enclosure.

00:54:53.810 --> 00:54:56.220 align:middle line:84%
See, if you find yourself
in middle of that flower,

00:54:56.220 --> 00:54:59.257 align:middle line:84%
then you will smell the
fragrance of divine.

00:54:59.257 --> 00:54:59.840 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:54:59.840 --> 00:55:05.110 align:middle line:84%
>>RADOS: So this represents--
this is the symbol of divine.

00:55:05.110 --> 00:55:06.590 align:middle line:90%
As I said, dot in the middle.

00:55:06.590 --> 00:55:07.464 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Absolutely.

00:55:07.464 --> 00:55:09.230 align:middle line:84%
>>RADOS: Enclosure,
so you can draw.

00:55:09.230 --> 00:55:11.060 align:middle line:90%
You can draw the balance.

00:55:11.060 --> 00:55:14.950 align:middle line:84%
You can create madness in
between dot and the circle,

00:55:14.950 --> 00:55:16.440 align:middle line:90%
or you can create a balance.

00:55:16.440 --> 00:55:17.610 align:middle line:90%
It's up to you.

00:55:17.610 --> 00:55:20.610 align:middle line:84%
When you create the balance,
you connect equal dots

00:55:20.610 --> 00:55:23.640 align:middle line:84%
connecting with another
circles like here,

00:55:23.640 --> 00:55:27.240 align:middle line:84%
and you have something
that is balance, perfect,

00:55:27.240 --> 00:55:30.760 align:middle line:84%
and representing your
feminine and masculine aspect

00:55:30.760 --> 00:55:33.200 align:middle line:84%
inside of you that
when you look at it,

00:55:33.200 --> 00:55:36.130 align:middle line:84%
then you can relax and
recognize those aspects,

00:55:36.130 --> 00:55:39.460 align:middle line:84%
recognize left and right
brain and equalize them

00:55:39.460 --> 00:55:40.300 align:middle line:90%
energetically.

00:55:40.300 --> 00:55:43.000 align:middle line:84%
At the moment, for
example, we are talking,

00:55:43.000 --> 00:55:47.150 align:middle line:84%
and maybe our right hemisphere
is more active than our left.

00:55:47.150 --> 00:55:48.030 align:middle line:90%
We are not logical.

00:55:48.030 --> 00:55:51.285 align:middle line:84%
We aren't talking mathematics
here and abstract stuff.

00:55:51.285 --> 00:55:53.530 align:middle line:90%
We are talking essential stuff.

00:55:53.530 --> 00:55:58.461 align:middle line:84%
So our right brain
is more active.

00:55:58.461 --> 00:56:01.290 align:middle line:84%
You can even see which
part of the brain

00:56:01.290 --> 00:56:03.910 align:middle line:84%
is more active by
measuring the amount of air

00:56:03.910 --> 00:56:05.520 align:middle line:90%
through your nose.

00:56:05.520 --> 00:56:08.310 align:middle line:84%
Close one because
this nostril is

00:56:08.310 --> 00:56:10.931 align:middle line:84%
linked with the other
opposite side of the brain,

00:56:10.931 --> 00:56:11.930 align:middle line:90%
and that one over there.

00:56:11.930 --> 00:56:13.260 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So my
right brain is open

00:56:13.260 --> 00:56:14.550 align:middle line:84%
right now because it's
coming in the left.

00:56:14.550 --> 00:56:15.370 align:middle line:90%
>>RADOS: Exactly.

00:56:15.370 --> 00:56:18.790 align:middle line:90%
So this is a little secret.

00:56:18.790 --> 00:56:20.435 align:middle line:84%
You can balance the
brain hemispheres.

00:56:20.435 --> 00:56:24.650 align:middle line:84%
If you attain 50-50%,
then your perception

00:56:24.650 --> 00:56:27.030 align:middle line:84%
will come, perception
from the wholeness.

00:56:27.030 --> 00:56:28.620 align:middle line:90%
The mind will be less active.

00:56:28.620 --> 00:56:32.130 align:middle line:84%
You will have gaps of
emptiness inside of your mind

00:56:32.130 --> 00:56:34.710 align:middle line:84%
where the wholeness, as I
explained will come to you

00:56:34.710 --> 00:56:37.325 align:middle line:84%
and give you the glory and
gratitude and compassion

00:56:37.325 --> 00:56:40.610 align:middle line:84%
and love, acceptance
of yourself,

00:56:40.610 --> 00:56:42.690 align:middle line:84%
which will bring
more creativity,

00:56:42.690 --> 00:56:45.869 align:middle line:84%
which will bring you more
stability in your life.

00:56:45.869 --> 00:56:46.410 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: OK.

00:56:46.410 --> 00:56:47.387 align:middle line:90%
So I have one for you.

00:56:47.387 --> 00:56:49.470 align:middle line:84%
We were talking about
iconic symbols in the world,

00:56:49.470 --> 00:56:52.130 align:middle line:84%
and I had just said
that most of what we see

00:56:52.130 --> 00:56:54.550 align:middle line:84%
is right angles, whether
it's squares, rectangles,

00:56:54.550 --> 00:56:55.320 align:middle line:90%
or whatnot.

00:56:55.320 --> 00:57:00.180 align:middle line:84%
However, let's take Apple,
the symbol for Apple.

00:57:00.180 --> 00:57:03.820 align:middle line:84%
Which you could say--
I mean, beautiful,

00:57:03.820 --> 00:57:09.790 align:middle line:84%
much more-- obviously rounded,
graceful, balanced on one hand.

00:57:09.790 --> 00:57:13.130 align:middle line:84%
But on the other,
also a technology

00:57:13.130 --> 00:57:15.990 align:middle line:90%
that completely enslaves us.

00:57:15.990 --> 00:57:19.400 align:middle line:84%
Our time, our energy,
our minds, and so forth.

00:57:19.400 --> 00:57:22.320 align:middle line:84%
Is there an incongruity
or an intention there?

00:57:22.320 --> 00:57:27.030 align:middle line:84%
>>RADOS: It's always intention
but not from consciousness.

00:57:27.030 --> 00:57:28.370 align:middle line:90%
It's intention.

00:57:28.370 --> 00:57:30.540 align:middle line:90%
You see, just listen.

00:57:30.540 --> 00:57:31.911 align:middle line:90%
Intention.

00:57:31.911 --> 00:57:32.410 align:middle line:90%
In-tention.

00:57:32.410 --> 00:57:34.960 align:middle line:90%


00:57:34.960 --> 00:57:36.330 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: In-tension.

00:57:36.330 --> 00:57:36.865 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:57:36.865 --> 00:57:38.140 align:middle line:90%
>>RADOS: It is tension.

00:57:38.140 --> 00:57:41.520 align:middle line:84%
Because to have intention-- so
you cannot hear-- for example,

00:57:41.520 --> 00:57:43.745 align:middle line:84%
just recently I found a
book Wayne Dyer wrote--

00:57:43.745 --> 00:57:44.620 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Wayne Dyer.

00:57:44.620 --> 00:57:45.732 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:57:45.732 --> 00:57:46.410 align:middle line:90%
Wayne Dyer.

00:57:46.410 --> 00:57:47.370 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:57:47.370 --> 00:57:49.200 align:middle line:84%
>>RADOS: You can use
intention to attain--

00:57:49.200 --> 00:57:53.650 align:middle line:84%
to achieve a good car, good
carpet, better house, better

00:57:53.650 --> 00:57:55.260 align:middle line:90%
lifestyle, this and that.

00:57:55.260 --> 00:57:57.177 align:middle line:84%
But you cannot find
yourself with intention,

00:57:57.177 --> 00:57:58.760 align:middle line:84%
because you're going
to be in tension.

00:57:58.760 --> 00:58:00.940 align:middle line:84%
So if you continue being in
tension, so you will never,

00:58:00.940 --> 00:58:01.760 align:middle line:90%
ever find yourself.

00:58:01.760 --> 00:58:03.130 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: It's a
tense state to be in.

00:58:03.130 --> 00:58:04.963 align:middle line:84%
>>RADOS: Being is an
intense state of being.

00:58:04.963 --> 00:58:06.580 align:middle line:84%
So you have to give
up on your tension

00:58:06.580 --> 00:58:09.326 align:middle line:90%
in order to attain nonintention.

00:58:09.326 --> 00:58:10.700 align:middle line:84%
State nonintentional
state to be.

00:58:10.700 --> 00:58:12.949 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Which is what we
were talking about earlier.

00:58:12.949 --> 00:58:14.820 align:middle line:90%
You create the idea.

00:58:14.820 --> 00:58:16.530 align:middle line:84%
You have to desire,
the motivation.

00:58:16.530 --> 00:58:18.356 align:middle line:84%
Then you put the
effort in, which

00:58:18.356 --> 00:58:19.980 align:middle line:84%
requires a certain
amount of intention,

00:58:19.980 --> 00:58:20.980 align:middle line:90%
and then let go of it.

00:58:20.980 --> 00:58:22.917 align:middle line:84%
Otherwise you remain
in tension, right?

00:58:22.917 --> 00:58:24.000 align:middle line:90%
>>RADOS: It was intention.

00:58:24.000 --> 00:58:28.750 align:middle line:84%
When you are in tension, you
are trapped in your mind.

00:58:28.750 --> 00:58:32.140 align:middle line:84%
You are in that tension between
positive and negative clashing

00:58:32.140 --> 00:58:33.980 align:middle line:84%
there, so you don't
know what to choose.

00:58:33.980 --> 00:58:35.450 align:middle line:84%
You're choosing
sometimes positive

00:58:35.450 --> 00:58:36.980 align:middle line:90%
while negative is following you.

00:58:36.980 --> 00:58:40.360 align:middle line:84%
Or you might choose negative to
punish yourself or someone else

00:58:40.360 --> 00:58:46.930 align:middle line:84%
while positive might come and
represent itself as whatever.

00:58:46.930 --> 00:58:49.100 align:middle line:84%
You see, the
complexity of reality

00:58:49.100 --> 00:58:53.200 align:middle line:84%
is the mind, the
way of the mind.

00:58:53.200 --> 00:58:57.700 align:middle line:84%
Simplicity of reality
is the way of no mind.

00:58:57.700 --> 00:58:59.130 align:middle line:84%
Everything is so
simple right now.

00:58:59.130 --> 00:59:01.630 align:middle line:90%
Life is happening right now.

00:59:01.630 --> 00:59:05.210 align:middle line:84%
Life is not happening
anywhere else apart from now.

00:59:05.210 --> 00:59:08.816 align:middle line:84%
So if you are right now,
you're very much alive.

00:59:08.816 --> 00:59:12.950 align:middle line:84%
If you have that awareness, if
you have that access to now,

00:59:12.950 --> 00:59:15.750 align:middle line:84%
then you will also realize
that you are infinite.

00:59:15.750 --> 00:59:18.220 align:middle line:84%
And when you are infinite,
there's no need to worry.

00:59:18.220 --> 00:59:19.640 align:middle line:90%
There's no need to be in fear.

00:59:19.640 --> 00:59:21.520 align:middle line:90%
There's no need to be anxious.

00:59:21.520 --> 00:59:24.350 align:middle line:84%
There's no need to separate
yourself and fantasize

00:59:24.350 --> 00:59:27.620 align:middle line:84%
about this and be
lost for some time.

00:59:27.620 --> 00:59:28.650 align:middle line:90%
You're present.

00:59:28.650 --> 00:59:33.600 align:middle line:84%
You see through everything
that appears in front of you.

00:59:33.600 --> 00:59:39.540 align:middle line:84%
So you see, if we are able to
see everything as illusion,

00:59:39.540 --> 00:59:44.700 align:middle line:84%
then we find ourselves real
at the end of the journey.

00:59:44.700 --> 00:59:46.530 align:middle line:84%
So everything you
are experiencing,

00:59:46.530 --> 00:59:48.640 align:middle line:84%
everything you are
seeing, everything

00:59:48.640 --> 00:59:54.280 align:middle line:84%
that appears and goes, it's
not real, and it's not you.

00:59:54.280 --> 00:59:54.940 align:middle line:90%
Do you get it?

00:59:54.940 --> 00:59:55.340 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:59:55.340 --> 00:59:56.464 align:middle line:90%
>>RADOS: It comes and goes.

00:59:56.464 --> 00:59:58.150 align:middle line:90%
It's a world of change.

00:59:58.150 --> 01:00:00.340 align:middle line:90%
You appear, you disappear.

01:00:00.340 --> 01:00:03.660 align:middle line:84%
I cannot remember-- we had an
interview, great interview.

01:00:03.660 --> 01:00:04.600 align:middle line:90%
You remember this.

01:00:04.600 --> 01:00:05.730 align:middle line:90%
I could not remember you.

01:00:05.730 --> 01:00:06.720 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: I remember the
time, it was wonderful.

01:00:06.720 --> 01:00:07.420 align:middle line:90%
But, yes.

01:00:07.420 --> 01:00:09.030 align:middle line:84%
>>RADOS: But what
I could remember

01:00:09.030 --> 01:00:12.420 align:middle line:84%
is your absolute
assertive voice.

01:00:12.420 --> 01:00:17.210 align:middle line:10%
And I said, this
person is absolutely

01:00:17.210 --> 01:00:20.810 align:middle line:10%
stable in her own self, you see?

01:00:20.810 --> 01:00:22.310 align:middle line:90%
That's what you get.

01:00:22.310 --> 01:00:26.820 align:middle line:84%
Not the shapes and forms, but
the essence, the consciousness.

01:00:26.820 --> 01:00:29.000 align:middle line:84%
So your body's
different than my body.

01:00:29.000 --> 01:00:30.590 align:middle line:84%
Your mind has a
different structure

01:00:30.590 --> 01:00:33.960 align:middle line:84%
than my body-- than
my mind and my body.

01:00:33.960 --> 01:00:39.220 align:middle line:84%
Your emotions fluctuate
differently than my emotions.

01:00:39.220 --> 01:00:42.280 align:middle line:84%
We are different in
outside circumstances.

01:00:42.280 --> 01:00:45.430 align:middle line:84%
But we are one and
the same in oneness.

01:00:45.430 --> 01:00:47.650 align:middle line:84%
Your consciousness
and my consciousness

01:00:47.650 --> 01:00:49.200 align:middle line:90%
is one consciousness.

01:00:49.200 --> 01:00:51.790 align:middle line:84%
When you become conscious
of who you are and I

01:00:51.790 --> 01:00:55.400 align:middle line:84%
become conscious of who you are,
I'll recognize myself in you.

01:00:55.400 --> 01:00:59.500 align:middle line:84%
Because your consciousness
is all about goodness, peace,

01:00:59.500 --> 01:01:04.210 align:middle line:84%
tranquility, love, happiness,
contentment in the moment.

01:01:04.210 --> 01:01:05.800 align:middle line:90%
That's the same in me.

01:01:05.800 --> 01:01:08.190 align:middle line:90%
So I recognize myself in you.

01:01:08.190 --> 01:01:09.420 align:middle line:90%
And that's what love is.

01:01:09.420 --> 01:01:11.120 align:middle line:90%
I love you, you see?

01:01:11.120 --> 01:01:12.680 align:middle line:90%
And you love me.

01:01:12.680 --> 01:01:15.070 align:middle line:84%
Actually, I accept
you the way you are.

01:01:15.070 --> 01:01:18.100 align:middle line:84%
If you decide to go
a little bit dreamy,

01:01:18.100 --> 01:01:23.140 align:middle line:84%
go and confirm to society that
you are valuable, available,

01:01:23.140 --> 01:01:23.640 align:middle line:90%
part of it.

01:01:23.640 --> 01:01:24.600 align:middle line:90%
So find good.

01:01:24.600 --> 01:01:25.450 align:middle line:90%
I'm OK with that.

01:01:25.450 --> 01:01:29.160 align:middle line:84%
And I will wait the moment
when I will recognize myself

01:01:29.160 --> 01:01:30.800 align:middle line:84%
in you again, and
we'll be together,

01:01:30.800 --> 01:01:34.600 align:middle line:84%
and love will be
there to be shared.

01:01:34.600 --> 01:01:35.360 align:middle line:90%
Do you get it?

01:01:35.360 --> 01:01:36.250 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: I do.

01:01:36.250 --> 01:01:37.830 align:middle line:90%
And-- wow.

01:01:37.830 --> 01:01:38.330 align:middle line:90%
OK.

01:01:38.330 --> 01:01:39.080 align:middle line:90%
We're out of time.

01:01:39.080 --> 01:01:40.260 align:middle line:90%
We actually went over time.

01:01:40.260 --> 01:01:42.134 align:middle line:84%
I've enjoyed myself so
much because I've just

01:01:42.134 --> 01:01:44.190 align:middle line:84%
been floating in the
right hemisphere,

01:01:44.190 --> 01:01:46.110 align:middle line:84%
just soaking in
what you're saying.

01:01:46.110 --> 01:01:49.360 align:middle line:84%
And I'm so glad we totally
diverted from my plan.

01:01:49.360 --> 01:01:49.960 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHTER]

01:01:49.960 --> 01:01:52.335 align:middle line:84%
>>RADOS: I didn't like your
plan anyway at the beginning.

01:01:52.335 --> 01:01:53.790 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHTER]

01:01:53.790 --> 01:01:54.980 align:middle line:90%
It's a good plan, actually.

01:01:54.980 --> 01:01:55.655 align:middle line:90%
Very good plan.

01:01:55.655 --> 01:01:56.600 align:middle line:90%
I mean, I'm joking.

01:01:56.600 --> 01:01:58.760 align:middle line:90%
It's a really good plan.

01:01:58.760 --> 01:02:02.162 align:middle line:10%
>>REGINA: Well, listen, we
didn't talk about your books,

01:02:02.162 --> 01:02:03.370 align:middle line:10%
but you've got a lot of them.

01:02:03.370 --> 01:02:05.050 align:middle line:84%
So we'll just go ahead
and wrap this up,

01:02:05.050 --> 01:02:06.758 align:middle line:84%
and I just want to
say thank you so much.

01:02:06.758 --> 01:02:09.660 align:middle line:84%
I really thoroughly enjoyed the
conversation and just literally

01:02:09.660 --> 01:02:11.420 align:middle line:90%
floating in that space with you.

01:02:11.420 --> 01:02:15.067 align:middle line:84%
>>RADOS: I'm very grateful
for you to appear in my life.

01:02:15.067 --> 01:02:15.900 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Thank you.

01:02:15.900 --> 01:02:18.460 align:middle line:84%
>>RADOS: Because I recognize
myself more in you.

01:02:18.460 --> 01:02:19.020 align:middle line:90%
Thank you.

01:02:19.020 --> 01:02:20.600 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: And vice versa.
