00:00:19.428 --> 00:00:21.720 align:middle line:10%
>>REGINA MEREDITH: I would
speculate that there has not

00:00:21.720 --> 00:00:23.640 align:middle line:10%
been a period of time
that has mirrored where

00:00:23.640 --> 00:00:27.510 align:middle line:10%
we are in 2020, in terms
of pervasive global stress

00:00:27.510 --> 00:00:28.800 align:middle line:10%
and anxiety.

00:00:28.800 --> 00:00:31.080 align:middle line:84%
On one hand, the world
quieted for a time and people

00:00:31.080 --> 00:00:32.070 align:middle line:90%
went inside.

00:00:32.070 --> 00:00:34.830 align:middle line:84%
But when we emerged,
the world had changed.

00:00:34.830 --> 00:00:37.710 align:middle line:84%
Tiffany Barsotti is a medical
intuitive and teacher.

00:00:37.710 --> 00:00:39.180 align:middle line:84%
And she's back with
us to help sift

00:00:39.180 --> 00:00:42.120 align:middle line:84%
through the process of
working through mass unrest

00:00:42.120 --> 00:00:45.120 align:middle line:84%
at both the macro
and micro levels--

00:00:45.120 --> 00:00:46.662 align:middle line:84%
very different than
last time we met.

00:00:46.662 --> 00:00:48.162 align:middle line:84%
>>TIFFANY BARSOTTI:
Most definitely.

00:00:48.162 --> 00:00:49.710 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: [LAUGHS]
Different world--

00:00:49.710 --> 00:00:51.840 align:middle line:84%
we've created a
parallel timeline.

00:00:51.840 --> 00:00:55.110 align:middle line:84%
It's really interesting,
in terms of what

00:00:55.110 --> 00:00:56.760 align:middle line:90%
this has unleashed in people.

00:00:56.760 --> 00:00:58.260 align:middle line:84%
So first, my first
question to you,

00:00:58.260 --> 00:01:00.825 align:middle line:84%
just to get the
conversation started,

00:01:00.825 --> 00:01:04.379 align:middle line:84%
in working with your clients
as a medical intuitive, what

00:01:04.379 --> 00:01:09.360 align:middle line:84%
have you seen as kind
of the mass response

00:01:09.360 --> 00:01:14.460 align:middle line:84%
to going through COVID, and
now the beginning of dealing

00:01:14.460 --> 00:01:16.800 align:middle line:84%
with what's happening
with the economy globally?

00:01:16.800 --> 00:01:19.080 align:middle line:10%
>>BARSOTTI: Yes, these
are huge important points,

00:01:19.080 --> 00:01:24.030 align:middle line:10%
and times for us to be looking
more deeply into who we really

00:01:24.030 --> 00:01:26.700 align:middle line:10%
are, is, I think,
the emergent quality.

00:01:26.700 --> 00:01:30.750 align:middle line:10%
So to begin with that
as the end in mind,

00:01:30.750 --> 00:01:33.360 align:middle line:10%
and we'll get there
throughout our conversation.

00:01:33.360 --> 00:01:40.290 align:middle line:84%
But people-- first of all, a
lot of anxiety, a lot of upset.

00:01:40.290 --> 00:01:42.120 align:middle line:84%
Actually first, it
was mostly fear.

00:01:42.120 --> 00:01:46.170 align:middle line:84%
And under anxiety, you
can usually find fear.

00:01:46.170 --> 00:01:52.050 align:middle line:84%
But the uncertainty of how
serious this virus SARS-CoV-2

00:01:52.050 --> 00:01:54.480 align:middle line:84%
really is, and what
effects are these

00:01:54.480 --> 00:01:57.840 align:middle line:84%
going to have on our family
and all of the people

00:01:57.840 --> 00:02:01.150 align:middle line:84%
that we know and love, and
how we usually do life.

00:02:01.150 --> 00:02:06.030 align:middle line:84%
So the fear factor of those
things really emerged.

00:02:06.030 --> 00:02:10.199 align:middle line:84%
And then what I started
hearing a lot of is,

00:02:10.199 --> 00:02:12.407 align:middle line:90%
I can't do this work anymore.

00:02:12.407 --> 00:02:13.740 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes, that's a big one.

00:02:13.740 --> 00:02:17.610 align:middle line:84%
>>BARSOTTI: I can't go back
to my old way of being.

00:02:17.610 --> 00:02:21.510 align:middle line:84%
And the healers, the other
healers that I work with,

00:02:21.510 --> 00:02:24.180 align:middle line:84%
are like, oh, phew,
a relaxed state,

00:02:24.180 --> 00:02:26.500 align:middle line:84%
I'm just going to
breathe into this.

00:02:26.500 --> 00:02:28.140 align:middle line:84%
I'm sort of built
for this, right?

00:02:28.140 --> 00:02:30.510 align:middle line:90%
I'm ready for all of this.

00:02:30.510 --> 00:02:34.275 align:middle line:84%
And then there are the people
that are really stressed by,

00:02:34.275 --> 00:02:37.260 align:middle line:90%
uh-oh, I don't have the tools.

00:02:37.260 --> 00:02:38.375 align:middle line:90%
I don't have the skills.

00:02:38.375 --> 00:02:39.750 align:middle line:84%
And now I'm locked
up with people

00:02:39.750 --> 00:02:43.650 align:middle line:84%
who I don't even
like, and also people

00:02:43.650 --> 00:02:45.990 align:middle line:84%
who are in really
awful situations

00:02:45.990 --> 00:02:48.600 align:middle line:84%
that they don't know
how to get along.

00:02:48.600 --> 00:02:50.378 align:middle line:84%
They're doing that
drama triangle dance,

00:02:50.378 --> 00:02:51.420 align:middle line:90%
which is rescue, victim--

00:02:51.420 --> 00:02:52.650 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Yeah, we're
going to get into this.

00:02:52.650 --> 00:02:54.120 align:middle line:90%
>>BARSOTTI: --yeah, persecutor.

00:02:54.120 --> 00:02:59.140 align:middle line:84%
And so that dance can be really
dangerous for a lot of people.

00:02:59.140 --> 00:03:00.810 align:middle line:84%
People are locked
up with abusers.

00:03:00.810 --> 00:03:04.540 align:middle line:84%
So there's been a whole
faction of experiences.

00:03:04.540 --> 00:03:08.310 align:middle line:84%
And I would say, primarily, by
the time that people find me,

00:03:08.310 --> 00:03:09.750 align:middle line:90%
they have--

00:03:09.750 --> 00:03:14.850 align:middle line:84%
or the people who find me,
they're seeking something else.

00:03:14.850 --> 00:03:16.440 align:middle line:90%
They know your work.

00:03:16.440 --> 00:03:17.910 align:middle line:90%
They know some of mine.

00:03:17.910 --> 00:03:20.160 align:middle line:84%
They've been searching
for different terms,

00:03:20.160 --> 00:03:23.460 align:middle line:84%
even on the internet, maybe that
they've searched in the past.

00:03:23.460 --> 00:03:25.200 align:middle line:84%
They don't want to
do the psychotherapy.

00:03:25.200 --> 00:03:28.080 align:middle line:84%
They don't want to do
the same sort of wheel

00:03:28.080 --> 00:03:29.580 align:middle line:90%
that they've been doing.

00:03:29.580 --> 00:03:31.230 align:middle line:90%
So they're changing.

00:03:31.230 --> 00:03:32.730 align:middle line:84%
I've even had a
bunch of people that

00:03:32.730 --> 00:03:35.730 align:middle line:84%
even searched for drama triangle
and found some of my videos.

00:03:35.730 --> 00:03:37.830 align:middle line:90%
So I was like, wow, OK.

00:03:37.830 --> 00:03:40.470 align:middle line:84%
So there's something waking
up in the Zeitgeist that

00:03:40.470 --> 00:03:44.233 align:middle line:90%
is helping to wake us up.

00:03:44.233 --> 00:03:45.400 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: I agree with that.

00:03:45.400 --> 00:03:49.380 align:middle line:84%
And you know, this
is the human species.

00:03:49.380 --> 00:03:50.798 align:middle line:90%
If everything's going along--

00:03:50.798 --> 00:03:52.340 align:middle line:84%
like the people who
say, I don't want

00:03:52.340 --> 00:03:57.000 align:middle line:84%
to do this anymore, OK,
pre-COVID, in the old world,

00:03:57.000 --> 00:04:01.050 align:middle line:84%
the other timeline, the
parallel reality, in that world

00:04:01.050 --> 00:04:03.500 align:middle line:84%
before, you would
say, ah, yeah, OK,

00:04:03.500 --> 00:04:05.708 align:middle line:84%
I don't like my job so much,
but hey, I'm used to it.

00:04:05.708 --> 00:04:06.508 align:middle line:90%
It's not so bad.

00:04:06.508 --> 00:04:07.350 align:middle line:90%
It pays the bills.

00:04:07.350 --> 00:04:09.750 align:middle line:84%
And so you're going
on, and your life

00:04:09.750 --> 00:04:11.290 align:middle line:90%
looks kind of normal to you.

00:04:11.290 --> 00:04:14.940 align:middle line:84%
And it has some moments
of satisfaction, right?

00:04:14.940 --> 00:04:17.399 align:middle line:84%
And if someone came to you,
if a little angel tapped you

00:04:17.399 --> 00:04:22.110 align:middle line:84%
on the shoulder and said, you
know what, your life really

00:04:22.110 --> 00:04:24.600 align:middle line:84%
could take a big
step up if you were

00:04:24.600 --> 00:04:27.840 align:middle line:84%
willing to make some
significant changes right now,

00:04:27.840 --> 00:04:29.700 align:middle line:84%
most people would
say, nah, I'm good.

00:04:29.700 --> 00:04:30.300 align:middle line:90%
>>BARSOTTI: Yeah, exactly.

00:04:30.300 --> 00:04:31.800 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: That's
what we do as people.

00:04:31.800 --> 00:04:32.070 align:middle line:90%
>>BARSOTTI: Leave it.

00:04:32.070 --> 00:04:34.530 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Until something
knocks us off our perch.

00:04:34.530 --> 00:04:36.810 align:middle line:84%
And so if we can
just accept the fact

00:04:36.810 --> 00:04:38.850 align:middle line:84%
that our level of
human development

00:04:38.850 --> 00:04:41.760 align:middle line:84%
is that we still tend to learn
through pressure, challenge,

00:04:41.760 --> 00:04:44.880 align:middle line:84%
and pain, then we can see
the beauty in all of this.

00:04:44.880 --> 00:04:48.060 align:middle line:84%
Meanwhile, it's not so
beautiful for those at home who

00:04:48.060 --> 00:04:50.190 align:middle line:90%
are now going through abuse.

00:04:50.190 --> 00:04:52.980 align:middle line:84%
And we need to talk about
that at a deep level.

00:04:52.980 --> 00:04:56.520 align:middle line:84%
Because sometimes, it's been
simmering, it's been there,

00:04:56.520 --> 00:04:59.340 align:middle line:84%
but it hasn't been expressed,
because the pressure wasn't on.

00:04:59.340 --> 00:05:04.003 align:middle line:84%
Let's talk about abuse,
how abuse is perpetuated.

00:05:04.003 --> 00:05:05.670 align:middle line:84%
>>BARSOTTI: Abuse is
really interesting,

00:05:05.670 --> 00:05:08.220 align:middle line:84%
because it's definitely part
of this whole karmic wheel.

00:05:08.220 --> 00:05:11.370 align:middle line:84%
We've both been the
abuser and the abused.

00:05:11.370 --> 00:05:13.560 align:middle line:84%
We've been the victim
and the victimizer.

00:05:13.560 --> 00:05:15.330 align:middle line:84%
So we really run
the gamut in all

00:05:15.330 --> 00:05:16.950 align:middle line:90%
of these various experiences.

00:05:16.950 --> 00:05:20.240 align:middle line:84%
And some people are
here figuring that out.

00:05:20.240 --> 00:05:23.870 align:middle line:90%
And they might even be in--

00:05:23.870 --> 00:05:27.380 align:middle line:84%
if you look at this karmically,
oh, I know this person.

00:05:27.380 --> 00:05:29.660 align:middle line:84%
I know this person
from other experiences,

00:05:29.660 --> 00:05:32.030 align:middle line:84%
whether it be a
distant relative that

00:05:32.030 --> 00:05:34.430 align:middle line:84%
had the same behavior,
or a past life,

00:05:34.430 --> 00:05:38.330 align:middle line:84%
or anything like that, where
these same dynamics are

00:05:38.330 --> 00:05:39.500 align:middle line:90%
at play.

00:05:39.500 --> 00:05:41.990 align:middle line:84%
And it's all calling
us to wake up.

00:05:41.990 --> 00:05:44.990 align:middle line:84%
But that discomfort that
we have to sit in, I think,

00:05:44.990 --> 00:05:47.900 align:middle line:90%
will expose the genius.

00:05:47.900 --> 00:05:52.100 align:middle line:84%
Jung said, the wound
becomes your genius.

00:05:52.100 --> 00:05:54.210 align:middle line:84%
That's not exactly
the exact right quote.

00:05:54.210 --> 00:05:58.880 align:middle line:84%
But if we allow it, the
wound is the challenge.

00:05:58.880 --> 00:06:01.400 align:middle line:84%
It's the thing that, yes,
we don't want anybody

00:06:01.400 --> 00:06:04.550 align:middle line:84%
to be in a really horrible,
abusive situation.

00:06:04.550 --> 00:06:05.760 align:middle line:90%
Of course not.

00:06:05.760 --> 00:06:08.780 align:middle line:84%
But if it is about that
person finding their own power

00:06:08.780 --> 00:06:11.420 align:middle line:84%
and getting their
essence back, then that

00:06:11.420 --> 00:06:14.125 align:middle line:84%
might be the thing that
they need to stand up and--

00:06:14.125 --> 00:06:15.500 align:middle line:84%
you don't necessarily
want to get

00:06:15.500 --> 00:06:17.160 align:middle line:90%
into a fight with your abuser--

00:06:17.160 --> 00:06:19.400 align:middle line:84%
but where is your
own power, and to be

00:06:19.400 --> 00:06:21.500 align:middle line:84%
able to start
utilizing your will,

00:06:21.500 --> 00:06:23.750 align:middle line:84%
and get smart about
the situations

00:06:23.750 --> 00:06:25.970 align:middle line:84%
and the relationships
that you're choosing,

00:06:25.970 --> 00:06:29.990 align:middle line:84%
and how it is that you're we're
the creators of our reality.

00:06:29.990 --> 00:06:32.220 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Well, and we
couldn't have chosen a more,

00:06:32.220 --> 00:06:34.640 align:middle line:84%
let's say, potent time
to learn that one.

00:06:34.640 --> 00:06:36.440 align:middle line:84%
Because oftentimes,
what happens is,

00:06:36.440 --> 00:06:40.700 align:middle line:84%
you're trapped in a situation,
psychologically, maybe even

00:06:40.700 --> 00:06:43.040 align:middle line:90%
karmically and otherwise.

00:06:43.040 --> 00:06:46.040 align:middle line:84%
You're in a situation, and
you can't see a way out.

00:06:46.040 --> 00:06:48.560 align:middle line:84%
Say you're a woman
with two or three kids.

00:06:48.560 --> 00:06:52.130 align:middle line:84%
And say you're in an abusive
relationship with a man.

00:06:52.130 --> 00:06:54.440 align:middle line:84%
And the man is the
one who is primarily

00:06:54.440 --> 00:06:55.880 align:middle line:90%
supporting the family.

00:06:55.880 --> 00:06:57.990 align:middle line:84%
This has been classic
throughout history.

00:06:57.990 --> 00:07:00.740 align:middle line:84%
This is what has allowed
the abuse to continue.

00:07:00.740 --> 00:07:04.430 align:middle line:84%
Now what happens when
the money's gone?

00:07:04.430 --> 00:07:07.610 align:middle line:84%
There is no money for
anyone to actually pick

00:07:07.610 --> 00:07:10.700 align:middle line:90%
up and move into a new place.

00:07:10.700 --> 00:07:14.690 align:middle line:84%
There's no first, last, and
security deposit available.

00:07:14.690 --> 00:07:16.310 align:middle line:90%
And now you're kind of really--

00:07:16.310 --> 00:07:19.760 align:middle line:84%
this is knocked on from this,
and the financial ramifications

00:07:19.760 --> 00:07:21.410 align:middle line:90%
of this COVID thing.

00:07:21.410 --> 00:07:24.380 align:middle line:90%
What happens?

00:07:24.380 --> 00:07:26.450 align:middle line:84%
How does a person
extract themselves

00:07:26.450 --> 00:07:30.710 align:middle line:84%
when they feel absolutely
powerless in the material world

00:07:30.710 --> 00:07:31.790 align:middle line:90%
to make a change?

00:07:31.790 --> 00:07:35.170 align:middle line:84%
>>BARSOTTI: Yeah,
it's a tough question.

00:07:35.170 --> 00:07:37.450 align:middle line:84%
Ultimately, we are
creative beings.

00:07:37.450 --> 00:07:42.340 align:middle line:84%
And I believe the anxieties
that actually thwart our ability

00:07:42.340 --> 00:07:46.190 align:middle line:84%
to be able to tap
into that creativity,

00:07:46.190 --> 00:07:49.950 align:middle line:84%
if we can get calm,
that we can allow that--

00:07:49.950 --> 00:07:53.150 align:middle line:84%
and I know the calm is
sometimes hard to reach.

00:07:53.150 --> 00:07:56.570 align:middle line:84%
But it's like we wait for that
little bit of inspiration,

00:07:56.570 --> 00:07:58.150 align:middle line:90%
that thing that comes in.

00:07:58.150 --> 00:08:01.310 align:middle line:84%
Because I have clients that are
in these kinds of situations

00:08:01.310 --> 00:08:02.990 align:middle line:90%
as what you just named.

00:08:02.990 --> 00:08:05.930 align:middle line:84%
And what has
happened to a couple

00:08:05.930 --> 00:08:10.370 align:middle line:84%
of them is they
realized, oh, I can't

00:08:10.370 --> 00:08:12.620 align:middle line:90%
do this the way that I used to.

00:08:12.620 --> 00:08:16.110 align:middle line:84%
But I'm going to teach
my classes differently.

00:08:16.110 --> 00:08:18.380 align:middle line:84%
I'm not going to follow
the curriculum, since all

00:08:18.380 --> 00:08:20.150 align:middle line:90%
these systems are broken.

00:08:20.150 --> 00:08:24.050 align:middle line:84%
Half my kids can't even get
on-- if they're-- as a teacher,

00:08:24.050 --> 00:08:27.500 align:middle line:84%
they can't even get online in
order do the online education.

00:08:27.500 --> 00:08:29.000 align:middle line:84%
So they're getting
really creative--

00:08:29.000 --> 00:08:31.360 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Yeah, this
is the beauty of it.

00:08:31.360 --> 00:08:33.470 align:middle line:84%
>>BARSOTTI: --and
that emergent quality

00:08:33.470 --> 00:08:36.020 align:middle line:90%
of us and our creative nature.

00:08:36.020 --> 00:08:38.150 align:middle line:84%
And I like to say
that, once ships

00:08:38.150 --> 00:08:40.250 align:middle line:90%
can come in over a calm sea.

00:08:40.250 --> 00:08:42.140 align:middle line:84%
And that to me is,
the vagus nerve

00:08:42.140 --> 00:08:46.760 align:middle line:84%
is your sea, of whether or not
you can be able to calm it.

00:08:46.760 --> 00:08:49.370 align:middle line:84%
And breath does a really
good job for doing that.

00:08:49.370 --> 00:08:51.025 align:middle line:90%
So if we can catch our breath--

00:08:51.025 --> 00:08:52.400 align:middle line:84%
there's a tool
that I like to use

00:08:52.400 --> 00:08:55.820 align:middle line:84%
and is a favorite of
amongst some of my clients.

00:08:55.820 --> 00:08:57.680 align:middle line:84%
It's the pattern
interrupt, where you just

00:08:57.680 --> 00:09:00.320 align:middle line:84%
stop in the middle
of all the craziness,

00:09:00.320 --> 00:09:02.960 align:middle line:84%
and know-- of course if you're
about to be hit by somebody

00:09:02.960 --> 00:09:06.350 align:middle line:84%
or be seriously abused,
keep your wits about you

00:09:06.350 --> 00:09:10.280 align:middle line:84%
and get smart, and find another
way to be in that situation--

00:09:10.280 --> 00:09:12.410 align:middle line:84%
or not be in that
situation rather.

00:09:12.410 --> 00:09:13.460 align:middle line:90%
Find a safe haven.

00:09:13.460 --> 00:09:15.790 align:middle line:84%
And there are people that
have been doing that.

00:09:15.790 --> 00:09:17.240 align:middle line:90%
But for the people that--

00:09:17.240 --> 00:09:21.920 align:middle line:84%
I would say 99.7% of
the time we are safe.

00:09:21.920 --> 00:09:26.780 align:middle line:84%
And what doesn't feel safe
is this sort of bullet train

00:09:26.780 --> 00:09:28.950 align:middle line:90%
that's happening in our head.

00:09:28.950 --> 00:09:32.250 align:middle line:84%
And if we can just collect
ourselves for a moment,

00:09:32.250 --> 00:09:34.880 align:middle line:84%
then we can allow the
creativity to come in.

00:09:34.880 --> 00:09:37.460 align:middle line:84%
So the pattern interrupt is
where you just stop, look

00:09:37.460 --> 00:09:38.390 align:middle line:90%
at your feet.

00:09:38.390 --> 00:09:40.710 align:middle line:84%
Because when you make
contact with your body,

00:09:40.710 --> 00:09:42.900 align:middle line:84%
the body is always
in the present.

00:09:42.900 --> 00:09:46.900 align:middle line:84%
So when you make contact with
the body, it's like, OK, land.

00:09:46.900 --> 00:09:47.900 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Take a breath.

00:09:47.900 --> 00:09:48.350 align:middle line:90%
>>BARSOTTI: Take a breath.

00:09:48.350 --> 00:09:49.767 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: There's
really-- there's

00:09:49.767 --> 00:09:53.840 align:middle line:84%
a strong point to taking
that breath that's

00:09:53.840 --> 00:09:55.588 align:middle line:90%
not just metaphorical.

00:09:55.588 --> 00:09:57.130 align:middle line:84%
>>BARSOTTI: No,
that's exactly right.

00:09:57.130 --> 00:09:59.120 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: It calms the
nervous system immediately.

00:09:59.120 --> 00:09:59.920 align:middle line:90%
Take a breath.

00:09:59.920 --> 00:10:01.100 align:middle line:90%
>>BARSOTTI: Take a breath.

00:10:01.100 --> 00:10:06.890 align:middle line:84%
And then realize, I'm in control
of my next thing, my thought.

00:10:06.890 --> 00:10:10.940 align:middle line:84%
I'm the one choosing where it
is that I choose to go next.

00:10:10.940 --> 00:10:14.510 align:middle line:84%
I can choose to
inflame this person.

00:10:14.510 --> 00:10:16.220 align:middle line:84%
Oh, OK, that's
the typical dance.

00:10:16.220 --> 00:10:17.680 align:middle line:90%
That's the thing that we do.

00:10:17.680 --> 00:10:21.172 align:middle line:84%
And so that inflaming
creates more of the same.

00:10:21.172 --> 00:10:22.880 align:middle line:84%
So if we start to make
different choices,

00:10:22.880 --> 00:10:24.840 align:middle line:90%
we get some different outcomes.

00:10:24.840 --> 00:10:28.060 align:middle line:84%
So I know of many people who
have created new businesses.

00:10:28.060 --> 00:10:29.980 align:middle line:84%
OK, their business
is now shut down.

00:10:29.980 --> 00:10:35.090 align:middle line:84%
And then they have to reinvent
who they are in this process.

00:10:35.090 --> 00:10:36.080 align:middle line:90%
And they're doing it.

00:10:36.080 --> 00:10:37.310 align:middle line:90%
But it's like a flash.

00:10:37.310 --> 00:10:38.240 align:middle line:90%
It's in a dream.

00:10:38.240 --> 00:10:39.710 align:middle line:90%
It's an insight.

00:10:39.710 --> 00:10:41.950 align:middle line:90%
It's something that comes in.

00:10:41.950 --> 00:10:45.620 align:middle line:84%
And sometimes, it feels like,
oh, wow, that is way too big,

00:10:45.620 --> 00:10:46.730 align:middle line:90%
I can't go for that.

00:10:46.730 --> 00:10:50.770 align:middle line:84%
Or they get what I like to call
the how hole, that you-- well,

00:10:50.770 --> 00:10:53.270 align:middle line:84%
how is that going to happen and
how is that going to happen?

00:10:53.270 --> 00:10:55.980 align:middle line:84%
Just take a breath again,
because the how isn't always

00:10:55.980 --> 00:10:56.780 align:middle line:90%
our job.

00:10:56.780 --> 00:11:00.170 align:middle line:84%
It's just to stay the course
of, I have this creative vision,

00:11:00.170 --> 00:11:01.910 align:middle line:84%
I'm going to nurture
this, and I'm

00:11:01.910 --> 00:11:03.680 align:middle line:90%
going to see what comes of it.

00:11:03.680 --> 00:11:06.950 align:middle line:84%
And so to allow the calmness
that can come over--

00:11:06.950 --> 00:11:08.900 align:middle line:90%
and it may not be calm.

00:11:08.900 --> 00:11:11.330 align:middle line:84%
That might be too
much of a leap.

00:11:11.330 --> 00:11:12.140 align:middle line:90%
And that's OK.

00:11:12.140 --> 00:11:14.900 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Even if it's a
moment of clarity, if not calm.

00:11:14.900 --> 00:11:16.310 align:middle line:90%
>>BARSOTTI: Yes, exactly.

00:11:16.310 --> 00:11:19.380 align:middle line:84%
So just get your feet in
the dirt for a second and--

00:11:19.380 --> 00:11:20.300 align:middle line:90%
or not even.

00:11:20.300 --> 00:11:23.120 align:middle line:84%
Just look at your
feet and just get back

00:11:23.120 --> 00:11:24.860 align:middle line:90%
into this present moment.

00:11:24.860 --> 00:11:27.800 align:middle line:84%
Because the stress mostly
is coming from living

00:11:27.800 --> 00:11:30.410 align:middle line:90%
too far in the past and future.

00:11:30.410 --> 00:11:32.698 align:middle line:84%
It's getting out of
the present moment.

00:11:32.698 --> 00:11:34.240 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And this
is requiring that.

00:11:34.240 --> 00:11:36.950 align:middle line:84%
And it's interesting, because
you were bringing up a teacher,

00:11:36.950 --> 00:11:40.880 align:middle line:84%
and I was flashing by free
association to my husband.

00:11:40.880 --> 00:11:44.030 align:middle line:84%
He was teaching a course called
Emotions and Motivation, which

00:11:44.030 --> 00:11:46.010 align:middle line:90%
is an amazing course.

00:11:46.010 --> 00:11:47.060 align:middle line:90%
It wasn't.

00:11:47.060 --> 00:11:49.970 align:middle line:84%
It was a textbook, and they
laid out this dry curriculum.

00:11:49.970 --> 00:11:51.980 align:middle line:84%
And he thought,
they do not pay me

00:11:51.980 --> 00:11:55.370 align:middle line:84%
enough to do this
crappy course this way.

00:11:55.370 --> 00:11:58.400 align:middle line:84%
So he totally reinvented
it, took it online,

00:11:58.400 --> 00:12:02.060 align:middle line:84%
turned it into a video
course of his own volition.

00:12:02.060 --> 00:12:06.590 align:middle line:84%
He ended up getting
a 4.9 rating out of 5

00:12:06.590 --> 00:12:08.830 align:middle line:84%
throughout-- he taught
it for seven semesters

00:12:08.830 --> 00:12:12.153 align:middle line:84%
through Northern
Arizona University.

00:12:12.153 --> 00:12:13.820 align:middle line:84%
Actually, he even has
it free for people

00:12:13.820 --> 00:12:15.920 align:middle line:90%
on his site askdrzeus.com.

00:12:15.920 --> 00:12:18.740 align:middle line:84%
But he did this as a
service to the students

00:12:18.740 --> 00:12:21.650 align:middle line:84%
to have something
real to graduate with,

00:12:21.650 --> 00:12:25.100 align:middle line:84%
rather than these
horrid, dry curriculums

00:12:25.100 --> 00:12:26.690 align:middle line:90%
that had been handed to him.

00:12:26.690 --> 00:12:29.090 align:middle line:84%
And like he said, you're
not paying me enough.

00:12:29.090 --> 00:12:31.220 align:middle line:84%
This is what's happening
with all these teachers.

00:12:31.220 --> 00:12:32.870 align:middle line:90%
You're not paying me enough.

00:12:32.870 --> 00:12:34.910 align:middle line:90%
This is not satisfying enough.

00:12:34.910 --> 00:12:37.190 align:middle line:84%
I want to do it my
way now, like what

00:12:37.190 --> 00:12:39.050 align:middle line:90%
you mentioned with this person.

00:12:39.050 --> 00:12:42.440 align:middle line:84%
I think it's a beautiful
time to basically disconnect.

00:12:42.440 --> 00:12:46.680 align:middle line:84%
And granted, it looks rather
chaotic and anarchistic.

00:12:46.680 --> 00:12:50.490 align:middle line:84%
But in all of us, we
have a little anarchist,

00:12:50.490 --> 00:12:53.430 align:middle line:84%
I think, where the opportunity
for our inner anarchist

00:12:53.430 --> 00:12:56.340 align:middle line:84%
is there to come out and
say, I can do this better

00:12:56.340 --> 00:12:58.260 align:middle line:90%
than what they want of me.

00:12:58.260 --> 00:13:00.460 align:middle line:84%
And what are you going
to do about it, you know?

00:13:00.460 --> 00:13:01.490 align:middle line:90%
>>BARSOTTI: Exactly.

00:13:01.490 --> 00:13:03.390 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So I think it's
a beautiful moment in time

00:13:03.390 --> 00:13:04.190 align:middle line:90%
for creativity.

00:13:04.190 --> 00:13:06.310 align:middle line:84%
I totally agree
with you on that.

00:13:06.310 --> 00:13:09.090 align:middle line:84%
Another thing is
that, people often--

00:13:09.090 --> 00:13:10.680 align:middle line:84%
when you're in
fear and shut down

00:13:10.680 --> 00:13:14.340 align:middle line:84%
like this, like in the
situation of abuse,

00:13:14.340 --> 00:13:17.940 align:middle line:84%
people can't see
possibility and opportunity.

00:13:17.940 --> 00:13:20.460 align:middle line:84%
Everything closes
into a little box.

00:13:20.460 --> 00:13:25.080 align:middle line:84%
And I've always said
to people, look around.

00:13:25.080 --> 00:13:27.120 align:middle line:90%
Where is their love?

00:13:27.120 --> 00:13:28.710 align:middle line:90%
Who loves you?

00:13:28.710 --> 00:13:32.160 align:middle line:84%
Your mom, your dad, your
brother, your cousin--

00:13:32.160 --> 00:13:33.660 align:middle line:90%
can you go there?

00:13:33.660 --> 00:13:37.860 align:middle line:84%
Go where love is, and just get
safe so you can think clearly.

00:13:37.860 --> 00:13:39.680 align:middle line:84%
And I would like your
thoughts on that,

00:13:39.680 --> 00:13:42.060 align:middle line:84%
the notion of how
to open ourselves up

00:13:42.060 --> 00:13:43.818 align:middle line:90%
so we can think clearly again.

00:13:43.818 --> 00:13:44.735 align:middle line:90%
>>BARSOTTI: Beautiful.

00:13:44.735 --> 00:13:46.402 align:middle line:84%
A couple of things
actually, because I'm

00:13:46.402 --> 00:13:48.390 align:middle line:84%
working with a couple
of people who actually

00:13:48.390 --> 00:13:53.790 align:middle line:84%
don't have a safe place,
that their family is not

00:13:53.790 --> 00:13:55.650 align:middle line:90%
a safe place.

00:13:55.650 --> 00:14:00.540 align:middle line:84%
And they're having to find
that inner reservoir of where

00:14:00.540 --> 00:14:03.060 align:middle line:90%
that love is for themselves.

00:14:03.060 --> 00:14:04.650 align:middle line:90%
And that is--

00:14:04.650 --> 00:14:07.890 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: That's the holy grail,
if you can find it in that.

00:14:07.890 --> 00:14:09.960 align:middle line:84%
>>BARSOTTI: And sometimes
these really tough--

00:14:09.960 --> 00:14:13.840 align:middle line:84%
like it's the coal being
forged into a diamond.

00:14:13.840 --> 00:14:18.180 align:middle line:84%
And it's that kind of
pressurization that's going on.

00:14:18.180 --> 00:14:19.980 align:middle line:90%
That's there for a reason.

00:14:19.980 --> 00:14:22.080 align:middle line:84%
And for some people,
that pressure

00:14:22.080 --> 00:14:25.740 align:middle line:84%
is really on, because that's
what it took in order for them

00:14:25.740 --> 00:14:27.480 align:middle line:90%
to find their tipping point.

00:14:27.480 --> 00:14:29.600 align:middle line:84%
And for some people,
if you can just--

00:14:29.600 --> 00:14:32.070 align:middle line:84%
I have a saying that, if
you follow the bread crumbs,

00:14:32.070 --> 00:14:33.750 align:middle line:90%
you end up being well-fed.

00:14:33.750 --> 00:14:37.260 align:middle line:84%
But if you're in resistance,
and you just want to argue,

00:14:37.260 --> 00:14:39.240 align:middle line:84%
and you want to
stay in judgment,

00:14:39.240 --> 00:14:41.010 align:middle line:84%
or you want to argue
for your limitations,

00:14:41.010 --> 00:14:42.712 align:middle line:84%
or you want to stay
in victim, these

00:14:42.712 --> 00:14:44.670 align:middle line:84%
are not times that are
going to serve you well.

00:14:44.670 --> 00:14:48.030 align:middle line:84%
And you will be flitted
around like a ping pong ball.

00:14:48.030 --> 00:14:52.200 align:middle line:90%
And to find that place--

00:14:52.200 --> 00:14:54.750 align:middle line:84%
because the only thing we can
really trust is ourselves.

00:14:54.750 --> 00:14:55.740 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: In the end, that's it,

00:14:55.740 --> 00:14:56.657 align:middle line:90%
>>BARSOTTI: That's it.

00:14:56.657 --> 00:14:59.370 align:middle line:84%
And so for people, whether
they don't have a safe place

00:14:59.370 --> 00:15:01.470 align:middle line:84%
or they do have a
safe place, what

00:15:01.470 --> 00:15:04.500 align:middle line:84%
is it that they know that they
can rely upon in themselves?

00:15:04.500 --> 00:15:06.630 align:middle line:84%
Where has there ever
been any evidence

00:15:06.630 --> 00:15:10.373 align:middle line:84%
in their life of some nugget
of truth that they follow?

00:15:10.373 --> 00:15:11.415 align:middle line:90%
Because we all have them.

00:15:11.415 --> 00:15:13.873 align:middle line:84%
It's just sometimes we have to
be a bit of an archaeologist

00:15:13.873 --> 00:15:15.820 align:middle line:90%
to go find them.

00:15:15.820 --> 00:15:19.380 align:middle line:84%
And I agree with you about
this little inner rebel

00:15:19.380 --> 00:15:22.290 align:middle line:84%
that is essential,
that we just rise up

00:15:22.290 --> 00:15:25.240 align:middle line:84%
and say, no, I'm not
doing it that way anymore.

00:15:25.240 --> 00:15:27.517 align:middle line:84%
And that's where the
creativity can emerge, as well,

00:15:27.517 --> 00:15:29.100 align:middle line:84%
because everything
else has been based

00:15:29.100 --> 00:15:30.870 align:middle line:90%
in status quo and control.

00:15:30.870 --> 00:15:32.100 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah, I agree.

00:15:32.100 --> 00:15:33.360 align:middle line:90%
Let's talk about this thing.

00:15:33.360 --> 00:15:37.090 align:middle line:84%
You and I had discussed this
a little in email beforehand.

00:15:37.090 --> 00:15:40.560 align:middle line:84%
And you were saying that
abusers are usually in denial

00:15:40.560 --> 00:15:42.210 align:middle line:90%
about their own power.

00:15:42.210 --> 00:15:43.540 align:middle line:90%
Now, what does that mean?

00:15:43.540 --> 00:15:45.123 align:middle line:84%
>>BARSOTTI: Well, a
couple of things--

00:15:45.123 --> 00:15:48.750 align:middle line:84%
so it's also, abusers
see somebody else's power

00:15:48.750 --> 00:15:50.880 align:middle line:90%
and want their power.

00:15:50.880 --> 00:15:53.070 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Or they're
threatened by their power.

00:15:53.070 --> 00:15:54.570 align:middle line:84%
>>BARSOTTI: By their
power, exactly.

00:15:54.570 --> 00:15:57.660 align:middle line:84%
And so you wonder, how is
it that little kids can

00:15:57.660 --> 00:15:58.950 align:middle line:90%
be molested?

00:15:58.950 --> 00:16:01.680 align:middle line:84%
How is it that
there is such abuse?

00:16:01.680 --> 00:16:02.542 align:middle line:90%
And what I find--

00:16:02.542 --> 00:16:04.500 align:middle line:84%
which is really interesting,
because I actually

00:16:04.500 --> 00:16:07.230 align:middle line:84%
use a form of esoteric
numerology, which

00:16:07.230 --> 00:16:11.820 align:middle line:84%
is Carl Jung's interpretation
of the Tarot, Pythagoras'

00:16:11.820 --> 00:16:13.110 align:middle line:90%
numbering system.

00:16:13.110 --> 00:16:15.060 align:middle line:90%
And it's from astrology.

00:16:15.060 --> 00:16:17.550 align:middle line:84%
I'm not an astrologer, but
I mix all of these things,

00:16:17.550 --> 00:16:19.470 align:middle line:90%
and it's really robust.

00:16:19.470 --> 00:16:22.830 align:middle line:84%
So what I end up
finding, more than--

00:16:22.830 --> 00:16:26.820 align:middle line:84%
I would say, just maybe
under 100% of the time,

00:16:26.820 --> 00:16:30.040 align:middle line:84%
is that people have what
we call a master number.

00:16:30.040 --> 00:16:32.607 align:middle line:84%
And in this system, we
take it all the way to 99.

00:16:32.607 --> 00:16:34.815 align:middle line:84%
But really, if you're going
to follow the Tarot deck,

00:16:34.815 --> 00:16:36.180 align:middle line:90%
it's to about 77.

00:16:36.180 --> 00:16:40.110 align:middle line:84%
But suffice it to say, these
people have this in common.

00:16:40.110 --> 00:16:42.300 align:middle line:84%
And what I typically
find is, is that there

00:16:42.300 --> 00:16:46.890 align:middle line:84%
needs to be this type of effort
put into their lives for them

00:16:46.890 --> 00:16:50.470 align:middle line:84%
to remember what their
journey was about.

00:16:50.470 --> 00:16:53.220 align:middle line:84%
And if everything
happens for our good

00:16:53.220 --> 00:16:55.800 align:middle line:84%
in our life, that's
the work, is,

00:16:55.800 --> 00:16:58.500 align:middle line:84%
why did we write
this into motion,

00:16:58.500 --> 00:17:00.270 align:middle line:90%
why at the causal plane?

00:17:00.270 --> 00:17:01.890 align:middle line:90%
We wrote all of this.

00:17:01.890 --> 00:17:06.210 align:middle line:84%
And so to remember that
that's actually-- oh, OK,

00:17:06.210 --> 00:17:09.540 align:middle line:84%
so as soon as I
really get this, I

00:17:09.540 --> 00:17:12.300 align:middle line:84%
don't need the abuser to still
be the abuser in my life,

00:17:12.300 --> 00:17:15.150 align:middle line:84%
because I can wake
up to my own power.

00:17:15.150 --> 00:17:20.280 align:middle line:84%
And also, the abuser who's
doing that, as a victimization

00:17:20.280 --> 00:17:22.692 align:middle line:84%
to other people,
they can also realize

00:17:22.692 --> 00:17:24.150 align:middle line:84%
that they don't
need other people's

00:17:24.150 --> 00:17:26.440 align:middle line:84%
power in order for
their survival.

00:17:26.440 --> 00:17:30.540 align:middle line:84%
So there can-- but as
soon as we stop playing

00:17:30.540 --> 00:17:32.970 align:middle line:84%
that role, the
other people don't

00:17:32.970 --> 00:17:34.860 align:middle line:90%
need to play in that role.

00:17:34.860 --> 00:17:37.230 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: It takes-- either
one could stop the chain

00:17:37.230 --> 00:17:38.160 align:middle line:90%
and break it.

00:17:38.160 --> 00:17:38.515 align:middle line:90%
>>BARSOTTI: Exactly.

00:17:38.515 --> 00:17:40.350 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Yeah, that's
a very good point.

00:17:40.350 --> 00:17:44.490 align:middle line:84%
OK, now let's go to another
subject, which is, you deal

00:17:44.490 --> 00:17:46.010 align:middle line:90%
with a lot of other healers.

00:17:46.010 --> 00:17:49.420 align:middle line:84%
And a lot of other healers
are also wobbly and trying

00:17:49.420 --> 00:17:50.740 align:middle line:90%
to find their own bearings.

00:17:50.740 --> 00:17:54.850 align:middle line:84%
And empaths are having a
particularly challenging time.

00:17:54.850 --> 00:17:57.460 align:middle line:84%
Let's talk about when
your field's wide open,

00:17:57.460 --> 00:17:59.140 align:middle line:84%
and you want to
be of assistance.

00:17:59.140 --> 00:18:02.680 align:middle line:84%
But you, yourself are having to
struggle for your own survival.

00:18:02.680 --> 00:18:05.140 align:middle line:84%
Because a lot of people
watching are empaths.

00:18:05.140 --> 00:18:06.550 align:middle line:90%
>>BARSOTTI: Yes, absolutely.

00:18:06.550 --> 00:18:09.190 align:middle line:84%
First of all, I have
a great compassion.

00:18:09.190 --> 00:18:11.870 align:middle line:84%
And we've talked about this
before with my own story.

00:18:11.870 --> 00:18:12.870 align:middle line:90%
And most us--

00:18:12.870 --> 00:18:14.620 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And refresh
people just a little

00:18:14.620 --> 00:18:16.690 align:middle line:84%
bit, if they haven't
already met you.

00:18:16.690 --> 00:18:20.710 align:middle line:84%
Just give us the thumbnail
sketch of your background

00:18:20.710 --> 00:18:22.750 align:middle line:84%
so they understand what
you're talking about.

00:18:22.750 --> 00:18:23.550 align:middle line:90%
>>BARSOTTI: OK.

00:18:23.550 --> 00:18:28.360 align:middle line:84%
So I had the so-called
gifts of the clairs--

00:18:28.360 --> 00:18:31.690 align:middle line:84%
the clairvoyance,
clairaudience, clairsentience,

00:18:31.690 --> 00:18:34.540 align:middle line:84%
claircognizance,
and so this knowing,

00:18:34.540 --> 00:18:37.810 align:middle line:90%
that was overwhelming to me.

00:18:37.810 --> 00:18:40.480 align:middle line:84%
I did everything in my power
to shut those things down,

00:18:40.480 --> 00:18:43.150 align:middle line:84%
because it was way overwhelming,
to a five-year-old,

00:18:43.150 --> 00:18:44.590 align:middle line:90%
a six-year-old, seven-year-old.

00:18:44.590 --> 00:18:46.210 align:middle line:84%
I had my first
out-of-body experience

00:18:46.210 --> 00:18:47.668 align:middle line:84%
with some stress
that was going on,

00:18:47.668 --> 00:18:50.760 align:middle line:84%
because my father was being
taken to jail at age seven.

00:18:50.760 --> 00:18:54.850 align:middle line:90%
So that was sort of the impetus.

00:18:54.850 --> 00:18:57.520 align:middle line:84%
Where I want to link
this in is that, I

00:18:57.520 --> 00:19:02.390 align:middle line:84%
was sensitive in so many
ways for so many purposes.

00:19:02.390 --> 00:19:05.110 align:middle line:84%
And it was to wake
up my own intuition,

00:19:05.110 --> 00:19:08.470 align:middle line:90%
and also to learn discernment.

00:19:08.470 --> 00:19:12.670 align:middle line:84%
I had to end up
figuring out, OK, this

00:19:12.670 --> 00:19:15.010 align:middle line:90%
that I'm feeling, whose is it?

00:19:15.010 --> 00:19:18.760 align:middle line:84%
Is it mine, is it not mine, and
working on that discernment.

00:19:18.760 --> 00:19:21.520 align:middle line:84%
Most empaths are
being bombarded,

00:19:21.520 --> 00:19:23.110 align:middle line:84%
because that
discernment is still

00:19:23.110 --> 00:19:25.150 align:middle line:90%
needing to get worked out.

00:19:25.150 --> 00:19:30.520 align:middle line:84%
And we can make ourselves crazy
by thinking that everything

00:19:30.520 --> 00:19:32.950 align:middle line:84%
that we're going around,
the room that you're in,

00:19:32.950 --> 00:19:35.180 align:middle line:84%
the people that you might
be hanging out with,

00:19:35.180 --> 00:19:38.740 align:middle line:84%
whomever, have
this effect on us.

00:19:38.740 --> 00:19:43.750 align:middle line:84%
Well, that being so
permeable is handy at times.

00:19:43.750 --> 00:19:45.850 align:middle line:84%
But we want to be able to
dial that back and have

00:19:45.850 --> 00:19:48.070 align:middle line:90%
some controls within that.

00:19:48.070 --> 00:19:51.850 align:middle line:84%
Because it's actually part
of the journey, to wake up.

00:19:51.850 --> 00:19:57.220 align:middle line:84%
Jung actually had, as a way
within the archetypal structure

00:19:57.220 --> 00:19:59.440 align:middle line:84%
as part of the archetypes
of individuation,

00:19:59.440 --> 00:20:01.480 align:middle line:90%
that you become empathic.

00:20:01.480 --> 00:20:04.960 align:middle line:84%
Well, that's good, but not
to get stuck and stay there.

00:20:04.960 --> 00:20:07.480 align:middle line:84%
Because then you're getting
flitted about by everybody

00:20:07.480 --> 00:20:08.800 align:middle line:90%
else's mood.

00:20:08.800 --> 00:20:13.950 align:middle line:84%
So that grounding, first, and
to get clear, what's mine.

00:20:13.950 --> 00:20:16.990 align:middle line:84%
I actually have something
that I use as a tool.

00:20:16.990 --> 00:20:19.000 align:middle line:84%
I literally ask
all the empaths--

00:20:19.000 --> 00:20:20.920 align:middle line:84%
and I challenge
all the empaths--

00:20:20.920 --> 00:20:24.040 align:middle line:84%
don't pick up other
stuff right now.

00:20:24.040 --> 00:20:25.223 align:middle line:90%
Get really clear.

00:20:25.223 --> 00:20:26.140 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: That's hard.

00:20:26.140 --> 00:20:27.520 align:middle line:90%
>>BARSOTTI: It is hard.

00:20:27.520 --> 00:20:29.620 align:middle line:90%
None of this is easy.

00:20:29.620 --> 00:20:31.497 align:middle line:90%
None of what we are in is easy.

00:20:31.497 --> 00:20:32.580 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: [LAUGHTER] True.

00:20:32.580 --> 00:20:35.140 align:middle line:84%
It's easy if you can
kind of isolate yourself.

00:20:35.140 --> 00:20:37.550 align:middle line:84%
But as long as you're around
a lot of other people, oy.

00:20:37.550 --> 00:20:38.350 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:20:38.350 --> 00:20:40.210 align:middle line:84%
>>BARSOTTI: And
what's interesting is

00:20:40.210 --> 00:20:42.670 align:middle line:84%
that people, even
when we did isolate,

00:20:42.670 --> 00:20:44.920 align:middle line:84%
the empaths that are
having a really tough time

00:20:44.920 --> 00:20:47.950 align:middle line:84%
are feeling the collective
grief, collective anger,

00:20:47.950 --> 00:20:49.810 align:middle line:90%
the collective confusion.

00:20:49.810 --> 00:20:52.840 align:middle line:84%
And it's yet even
another call to action,

00:20:52.840 --> 00:20:56.380 align:middle line:84%
another layer to get
even more discerning.

00:20:56.380 --> 00:20:57.452 align:middle line:90%
So that's a key.

00:20:57.452 --> 00:20:59.410 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And discernment
is the key right now.

00:20:59.410 --> 00:21:01.170 align:middle line:90%
And this whole thing about--

00:21:01.170 --> 00:21:05.140 align:middle line:84%
OK, so I was reading
some stats this morning.

00:21:05.140 --> 00:21:10.000 align:middle line:84%
And there's a site called
the medium.com, which

00:21:10.000 --> 00:21:13.190 align:middle line:84%
has a lot of good articles,
contemporary, different points

00:21:13.190 --> 00:21:13.990 align:middle line:90%
of view.

00:21:13.990 --> 00:21:15.550 align:middle line:84%
And the first one
up this morning

00:21:15.550 --> 00:21:19.240 align:middle line:84%
was one by a young man who
was basically saying, OK,

00:21:19.240 --> 00:21:21.190 align:middle line:84%
America has walked
away from COVID.

00:21:21.190 --> 00:21:23.140 align:middle line:90%
We are screwed for years.

00:21:23.140 --> 00:21:25.480 align:middle line:90%
It was very dark, very negative.

00:21:25.480 --> 00:21:28.510 align:middle line:84%
And so I started thinking
about it, and thought, hmm,

00:21:28.510 --> 00:21:30.190 align:middle line:90%
what has happened here?

00:21:30.190 --> 00:21:34.280 align:middle line:84%
And I realized, this
is a large country.

00:21:34.280 --> 00:21:36.910 align:middle line:84%
This is a country that's
not really a country.

00:21:36.910 --> 00:21:40.240 align:middle line:84%
California and the West Coast
has one way of thinking.

00:21:40.240 --> 00:21:42.610 align:middle line:84%
Northeast has a
completely different way

00:21:42.610 --> 00:21:44.020 align:middle line:90%
of thinking and culture.

00:21:44.020 --> 00:21:47.080 align:middle line:84%
The South, the Southwest,
and the Midwest--

00:21:47.080 --> 00:21:50.230 align:middle line:84%
completely different
realities, each one

00:21:50.230 --> 00:21:53.230 align:middle line:84%
contending with this
situation in their own way,

00:21:53.230 --> 00:21:55.930 align:middle line:84%
each one decided when and
how they're going to open.

00:21:55.930 --> 00:21:58.760 align:middle line:84%
There was no real science at
any level that was cohesive,

00:21:58.760 --> 00:22:00.460 align:middle line:84%
so you just picked
the one you wanted,

00:22:00.460 --> 00:22:02.200 align:middle line:90%
the study that you wanted.

00:22:02.200 --> 00:22:03.370 align:middle line:90%
And so here we are.

00:22:03.370 --> 00:22:05.170 align:middle line:84%
It's almost as though
we're living in--

00:22:05.170 --> 00:22:08.890 align:middle line:84%
everyone's living in
their own reality bubble.

00:22:08.890 --> 00:22:11.960 align:middle line:84%
But the discernment doesn't
seem to have been developed.

00:22:11.960 --> 00:22:13.960 align:middle line:84%
So let's talk about,
in a time when you're

00:22:13.960 --> 00:22:18.670 align:middle line:84%
untethered from any kind of
collectively agreed upon norms,

00:22:18.670 --> 00:22:22.210 align:middle line:84%
what happens when you then
are put under pressure

00:22:22.210 --> 00:22:24.220 align:middle line:84%
and you have to figure
it out for yourself?

00:22:24.220 --> 00:22:26.387 align:middle line:84%
>>BARSOTTI: You know what's
so beautiful about this?

00:22:26.387 --> 00:22:28.570 align:middle line:84%
I think this taps
into the Aquarian Age.

00:22:28.570 --> 00:22:33.160 align:middle line:84%
This taps into exactly
where-- we are right on time.

00:22:33.160 --> 00:22:35.740 align:middle line:84%
And only the creator
makes this much

00:22:35.740 --> 00:22:37.347 align:middle line:90%
of a mess out of everything.

00:22:37.347 --> 00:22:38.570 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHTER]

00:22:38.570 --> 00:22:39.550 align:middle line:90%
So if we--

00:22:39.550 --> 00:22:41.590 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And it
was in the stars.

00:22:41.590 --> 00:22:44.320 align:middle line:84%
We did astrological--
I did a couple shows

00:22:44.320 --> 00:22:47.340 align:middle line:84%
on it, one in Western astrology
with Robert Phoenix, one

00:22:47.340 --> 00:22:49.800 align:middle line:84%
with Simon Chokoisky
and Vedic astrology.

00:22:49.800 --> 00:22:53.850 align:middle line:84%
They both pointed-- said,
uh-oh, winter of 2020,

00:22:53.850 --> 00:22:56.910 align:middle line:84%
don't know what it is, but
what a ride we're going on.

00:22:56.910 --> 00:22:57.960 align:middle line:90%
So it's in the stars.

00:22:57.960 --> 00:22:59.235 align:middle line:90%
It was meant to be.

00:22:59.235 --> 00:23:01.110 align:middle line:84%
>>BARSOTTI: It is-- and
the Chinese New Year.

00:23:01.110 --> 00:23:01.500 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:23:01.500 --> 00:23:02.460 align:middle line:90%
Oh, tell us about that.

00:23:02.460 --> 00:23:04.170 align:middle line:84%
>>BARSOTTI: Yeah,
the Chinese New Year,

00:23:04.170 --> 00:23:07.620 align:middle line:84%
which is beginning the top
of February, end of January,

00:23:07.620 --> 00:23:09.450 align:middle line:90%
top of February, right?

00:23:09.450 --> 00:23:12.900 align:middle line:84%
It's the white metal rat, which
is technology and viruses.

00:23:12.900 --> 00:23:14.740 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHTER]

00:23:14.740 --> 00:23:16.020 align:middle line:90%
You can't make this stuff up.

00:23:16.020 --> 00:23:17.013 align:middle line:90%
I mean, it's there.

00:23:17.013 --> 00:23:18.930 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So let's just
say it's in the cards.

00:23:18.930 --> 00:23:20.260 align:middle line:90%
This was supposed to happen.

00:23:20.260 --> 00:23:22.320 align:middle line:84%
So go on about the
Age of Aquarius thing.

00:23:22.320 --> 00:23:24.650 align:middle line:84%
>>BARSOTTI: Yeah, so I
really feel that this is--

00:23:24.650 --> 00:23:27.660 align:middle line:84%
and who knows exactly when
this really got going.

00:23:27.660 --> 00:23:31.680 align:middle line:84%
But it says that we're been
in it for a period of time

00:23:31.680 --> 00:23:32.970 align:middle line:90%
already, right?

00:23:32.970 --> 00:23:36.300 align:middle line:84%
It's the awakening of
our own human potential.

00:23:36.300 --> 00:23:39.090 align:middle line:84%
But we have to remember
what it is to be that human,

00:23:39.090 --> 00:23:43.320 align:middle line:84%
to remember our own will,
to remember our discernment.

00:23:43.320 --> 00:23:47.280 align:middle line:84%
And our own will
eventually is enabling us

00:23:47.280 --> 00:23:50.190 align:middle line:90%
to be able to choose surrender.

00:23:50.190 --> 00:23:55.230 align:middle line:84%
And as we are
navigating these waters,

00:23:55.230 --> 00:23:57.720 align:middle line:84%
I really-- there's another
challenge I would like to make,

00:23:57.720 --> 00:23:59.850 align:middle line:84%
is that, with all
the news that we

00:23:59.850 --> 00:24:02.780 align:middle line:84%
are hearing, all of
the various opinions,

00:24:02.780 --> 00:24:06.750 align:middle line:84%
east, north, west,
south, European, Asian,

00:24:06.750 --> 00:24:09.430 align:middle line:84%
wherever we are in the world, it
doesn't matter, South African,

00:24:09.430 --> 00:24:12.280 align:middle line:84%
South American,
African, there's going

00:24:12.280 --> 00:24:13.890 align:middle line:84%
to be all these
different opinions

00:24:13.890 --> 00:24:15.840 align:middle line:90%
on all of these things.

00:24:15.840 --> 00:24:18.480 align:middle line:90%
What is your truth?

00:24:18.480 --> 00:24:19.290 align:middle line:90%
What is it?

00:24:19.290 --> 00:24:22.320 align:middle line:84%
Like get really in
touch with, what is it?

00:24:22.320 --> 00:24:24.840 align:middle line:84%
All right, what message
am I getting from my body?

00:24:24.840 --> 00:24:27.190 align:middle line:90%
What message am I--

00:24:27.190 --> 00:24:29.970 align:middle line:84%
and is this reality that
everybody's talking about,

00:24:29.970 --> 00:24:31.000 align:middle line:90%
is this my reality?

00:24:31.000 --> 00:24:33.000 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Right, because
your body will say, eh,

00:24:33.000 --> 00:24:35.550 align:middle line:90%
I'm not too worried.

00:24:35.550 --> 00:24:36.900 align:middle line:90%
I'm not feeling it.

00:24:36.900 --> 00:24:39.720 align:middle line:84%
Someone else will
really be feeling it.

00:24:39.720 --> 00:24:42.270 align:middle line:84%
And so this is
subtle information

00:24:42.270 --> 00:24:43.410 align:middle line:90%
that's being communicated.

00:24:43.410 --> 00:24:45.480 align:middle line:84%
We don't understand
the nature of feelings.

00:24:45.480 --> 00:24:47.940 align:middle line:84%
It's subtle information
being communicated to us,

00:24:47.940 --> 00:24:50.140 align:middle line:84%
through our feelings,
even through our bodies,

00:24:50.140 --> 00:24:52.500 align:middle line:84%
and def-- well, definitely
into the bodies.

00:24:52.500 --> 00:24:53.340 align:middle line:90%
Continue, yes.

00:24:53.340 --> 00:24:56.310 align:middle line:84%
>>BARSOTTI: Yeah, our
bodies have such wisdom.

00:24:56.310 --> 00:25:00.480 align:middle line:84%
But we have given away
so much power to--

00:25:00.480 --> 00:25:03.600 align:middle line:84%
whether it be other
people, other doctors.

00:25:03.600 --> 00:25:07.170 align:middle line:84%
And that's another facet
of the Aquarian Age

00:25:07.170 --> 00:25:10.950 align:middle line:84%
is that, this isn't so much
about reductionistic way

00:25:10.950 --> 00:25:11.940 align:middle line:90%
of thinking.

00:25:11.940 --> 00:25:15.660 align:middle line:84%
This is about, OK,
inclusive in my own reality,

00:25:15.660 --> 00:25:16.740 align:middle line:90%
what is my truth?

00:25:16.740 --> 00:25:18.450 align:middle line:90%
What is it that I see?

00:25:18.450 --> 00:25:22.590 align:middle line:84%
All right, I know I am
being impulsed, internally,

00:25:22.590 --> 00:25:24.180 align:middle line:90%
not to eat sugar--

00:25:24.180 --> 00:25:25.230 align:middle line:90%
good idea.

00:25:25.230 --> 00:25:29.790 align:middle line:84%
I'm being impulsed to
eat more natural fibers

00:25:29.790 --> 00:25:33.510 align:middle line:84%
and eat more naturally
and less processed food.

00:25:33.510 --> 00:25:34.570 align:middle line:90%
Follow it.

00:25:34.570 --> 00:25:37.960 align:middle line:84%
These are the things that
I think will give us--

00:25:37.960 --> 00:25:38.760 align:middle line:90%
I don't think.

00:25:38.760 --> 00:25:39.560 align:middle line:90%
I know it.

00:25:39.560 --> 00:25:41.790 align:middle line:84%
I know it at every
part of my being, that,

00:25:41.790 --> 00:25:45.390 align:middle line:84%
as we follow that
internal compass,

00:25:45.390 --> 00:25:47.250 align:middle line:90%
then we will find our way.

00:25:47.250 --> 00:25:49.290 align:middle line:84%
Then we're led to
those breadcrumbs.

00:25:49.290 --> 00:25:51.145 align:middle line:84%
Then we can find
those little morsels.

00:25:51.145 --> 00:25:52.020 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Absolutely.

00:25:52.020 --> 00:25:53.580 align:middle line:84%
But you have to
be able to discern

00:25:53.580 --> 00:25:56.580 align:middle line:90%
that voice from the other one.

00:25:56.580 --> 00:25:58.490 align:middle line:84%
You know, you got them
on both shoulders.

00:25:58.490 --> 00:26:01.360 align:middle line:84%
And you'll say, oh, I really,
really want that sugary thing

00:26:01.360 --> 00:26:02.160 align:middle line:90%
right now.

00:26:02.160 --> 00:26:02.970 align:middle line:90%
I really want it.

00:26:02.970 --> 00:26:03.980 align:middle line:90%
It'd make me feel good.

00:26:03.980 --> 00:26:06.522 align:middle line:84%
And the other one's trying to
say, your body's trying to say,

00:26:06.522 --> 00:26:07.800 align:middle line:90%
mm, not really.

00:26:07.800 --> 00:26:10.385 align:middle line:84%
And so right now,
when you have stress,

00:26:10.385 --> 00:26:11.760 align:middle line:84%
people have a hard
time listening

00:26:11.760 --> 00:26:12.843 align:middle line:90%
to the more subtle voices.

00:26:12.843 --> 00:26:13.920 align:middle line:90%
>>BARSOTTI: It's true.

00:26:13.920 --> 00:26:16.700 align:middle line:84%
And the more we
practice it, however--

00:26:16.700 --> 00:26:18.360 align:middle line:84%
and this is what I'm
going to say also

00:26:18.360 --> 00:26:20.640 align:middle line:90%
is the discipline of our time.

00:26:20.640 --> 00:26:23.250 align:middle line:84%
This, it's not an
overnight process.

00:26:23.250 --> 00:26:26.820 align:middle line:84%
And I'll speak for
myself, historically.

00:26:26.820 --> 00:26:29.940 align:middle line:84%
When I was getting
myself out of OCD,

00:26:29.940 --> 00:26:34.320 align:middle line:84%
very much I was in an
argument-- the ego guidance

00:26:34.320 --> 00:26:36.360 align:middle line:84%
and the intuition
guidance, this like--

00:26:36.360 --> 00:26:40.530 align:middle line:84%
as you were just gesturing,
on either side, like woo, OK.

00:26:40.530 --> 00:26:42.720 align:middle line:84%
And both spoke the
truth at times.

00:26:42.720 --> 00:26:45.330 align:middle line:90%
Both had a lot of convincing.

00:26:45.330 --> 00:26:46.950 align:middle line:84%
The thing is, the
smarter that we get,

00:26:46.950 --> 00:26:48.540 align:middle line:90%
the smarter our ego gets.

00:26:48.540 --> 00:26:51.390 align:middle line:84%
So it uses all these
pieces of information

00:26:51.390 --> 00:26:54.330 align:middle line:84%
that we've gathered
over time and uses it.

00:26:54.330 --> 00:26:56.250 align:middle line:90%
And it's like, oh, aren't you--

00:26:56.250 --> 00:26:58.470 align:middle line:90%
OK, this is really good.

00:26:58.470 --> 00:27:01.240 align:middle line:84%
All right, so I'm just going
to pause here for a second,

00:27:01.240 --> 00:27:02.950 align:middle line:84%
and I'm not going
to take action.

00:27:02.950 --> 00:27:05.790 align:middle line:84%
I'm not going to take action,
because it's not clear.

00:27:05.790 --> 00:27:08.430 align:middle line:84%
And until we get
that discipline,

00:27:08.430 --> 00:27:10.620 align:middle line:84%
that I'm not going to come
from a reactive place,

00:27:10.620 --> 00:27:12.180 align:middle line:84%
I'm not going to
come from this place

00:27:12.180 --> 00:27:15.360 align:middle line:84%
where I'm just literally
being flitted about, again,

00:27:15.360 --> 00:27:18.180 align:middle line:84%
either by somebody else's
mood or a condition

00:27:18.180 --> 00:27:21.240 align:middle line:84%
or something that might
feel good temporarily.

00:27:21.240 --> 00:27:22.800 align:middle line:90%
I know what the outcome is.

00:27:22.800 --> 00:27:24.930 align:middle line:84%
And the outcome is
always the same,

00:27:24.930 --> 00:27:27.030 align:middle line:84%
and so let me choose
something different.

00:27:27.030 --> 00:27:29.940 align:middle line:84%
Because this is the
insaneness of sameness,

00:27:29.940 --> 00:27:34.770 align:middle line:84%
that we just continue to
perpetuate the same ideas that

00:27:34.770 --> 00:27:37.110 align:middle line:90%
don't--

00:27:37.110 --> 00:27:39.460 align:middle line:84%
they don't pan out
to our creativity.

00:27:39.460 --> 00:27:41.590 align:middle line:84%
It's just keeping us
on the karmic wheel.

00:27:41.590 --> 00:27:42.390 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Exactly.

00:27:42.390 --> 00:27:45.100 align:middle line:84%
And a lot of that just is
simply down to our beliefs,

00:27:45.100 --> 00:27:46.850 align:middle line:84%
that have become
concretized, so to speak.

00:27:46.850 --> 00:27:49.080 align:middle line:84%
So I'm going to go off
script a little bit here.

00:27:49.080 --> 00:27:51.780 align:middle line:84%
And I don't know if this is an
area that you choose to go in

00:27:51.780 --> 00:27:52.940 align:middle line:90%
or are comfortable with.

00:27:52.940 --> 00:27:58.970 align:middle line:84%
But this, to me, offers
the ultimate opportunity.

00:27:58.970 --> 00:28:00.030 align:middle line:90%
I'll give you an example.

00:28:00.030 --> 00:28:02.570 align:middle line:84%
I interviewed a woman
named Elena Tonetti

00:28:02.570 --> 00:28:05.870 align:middle line:84%
Vladimirova, many years ago,
probably close to 10 years

00:28:05.870 --> 00:28:06.950 align:middle line:90%
ago now.

00:28:06.950 --> 00:28:10.970 align:middle line:84%
And she lived in a
Siberian village.

00:28:10.970 --> 00:28:13.640 align:middle line:84%
And it was the first
place Russia had--

00:28:13.640 --> 00:28:18.950 align:middle line:84%
or the Soviet Union had
placed a nuclear power

00:28:18.950 --> 00:28:20.960 align:middle line:90%
to power the community.

00:28:20.960 --> 00:28:23.780 align:middle line:84%
It didn't go well,
had lots of leaks.

00:28:23.780 --> 00:28:25.700 align:middle line:84%
So she and her
entire community were

00:28:25.700 --> 00:28:30.140 align:middle line:84%
exposed to radiation poisoning,
low level, constant radiation

00:28:30.140 --> 00:28:32.360 align:middle line:90%
poisoning for a long time.

00:28:32.360 --> 00:28:34.340 align:middle line:84%
And she said it
was so interesting

00:28:34.340 --> 00:28:37.170 align:middle line:90%
how people's bodies responded.

00:28:37.170 --> 00:28:38.390 align:middle line:90%
She said in roughly--

00:28:38.390 --> 00:28:39.500 align:middle line:90%
this is rough terms--

00:28:39.500 --> 00:28:41.670 align:middle line:84%
roughly half the
population anomalies

00:28:41.670 --> 00:28:46.800 align:middle line:84%
started happening-- cancers,
birth defects, strange things.

00:28:46.800 --> 00:28:49.610 align:middle line:84%
But in the other part
of the population,

00:28:49.610 --> 00:28:53.840 align:middle line:84%
they developed these like
super immune systems--

00:28:53.840 --> 00:28:55.550 align:middle line:90%
and she was one of those--

00:28:55.550 --> 00:28:58.520 align:middle line:84%
to the point where she said,
when Fukushima happened,

00:28:58.520 --> 00:29:02.480 align:middle line:84%
she was so excited she
wanted to go there and be

00:29:02.480 --> 00:29:05.870 align:middle line:84%
in the radiation
because it feeds her.

00:29:05.870 --> 00:29:08.300 align:middle line:84%
And you look at Hiroshima,
a thriving city today.

00:29:08.300 --> 00:29:11.030 align:middle line:84%
What's the half-life, hundreds,
thousands of years of that kind

00:29:11.030 --> 00:29:12.200 align:middle line:90%
of radiation?

00:29:12.200 --> 00:29:15.140 align:middle line:90%
Built a city there, people are--

00:29:15.140 --> 00:29:17.360 align:middle line:84%
I think the stats are
pretty good, in terms

00:29:17.360 --> 00:29:18.950 align:middle line:90%
of even the cancer rates.

00:29:18.950 --> 00:29:23.840 align:middle line:84%
And it's a thriving city today,
only, what, 50, 60 years later.

00:29:23.840 --> 00:29:25.280 align:middle line:90%
So what's going on here?

00:29:25.280 --> 00:29:28.220 align:middle line:84%
This is a lot of this thing
you were talking about,

00:29:28.220 --> 00:29:29.450 align:middle line:90%
the sameness thing.

00:29:29.450 --> 00:29:31.070 align:middle line:84%
We need to break
those perceptions.

00:29:31.070 --> 00:29:34.270 align:middle line:84%
We're non-physical
beings at the core.

00:29:34.270 --> 00:29:35.870 align:middle line:90%
And I mean on an atomic level.

00:29:35.870 --> 00:29:37.490 align:middle line:90%
We are non-physical beings.

00:29:37.490 --> 00:29:40.040 align:middle line:84%
We are nothing but space,
with this perception

00:29:40.040 --> 00:29:41.760 align:middle line:90%
that we're seeing here.

00:29:41.760 --> 00:29:45.710 align:middle line:84%
So what can we do in this
change, this time that

00:29:45.710 --> 00:29:49.850 align:middle line:84%
offers creativity, the
opportunity for discernment,

00:29:49.850 --> 00:29:52.130 align:middle line:84%
and to take back the
power of our own mind?

00:29:52.130 --> 00:29:57.290 align:middle line:84%
What can we create by way of
mastery our own body and cells

00:29:57.290 --> 00:29:59.450 align:middle line:84%
and our body's reaction
to things like COVID

00:29:59.450 --> 00:30:01.412 align:middle line:84%
or whatever comes
up in the future.

00:30:01.412 --> 00:30:02.870 align:middle line:84%
>>BARSOTTI: I think
it's happening.

00:30:02.870 --> 00:30:06.290 align:middle line:10%
I think, so long as we
don't operate out of stress,

00:30:06.290 --> 00:30:09.710 align:middle line:10%
we can allow ourselves to just
move gently down the river.

00:30:09.710 --> 00:30:11.330 align:middle line:84%
And those people
didn't know what

00:30:11.330 --> 00:30:13.410 align:middle line:90%
was happening to them, right?

00:30:13.410 --> 00:30:14.660 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: No, not for a while.

00:30:14.660 --> 00:30:15.410 align:middle line:90%
>>BARSOTTI: Right, exactly.

00:30:15.410 --> 00:30:17.000 align:middle line:84%
It's like the frogs
in water, right?

00:30:17.000 --> 00:30:19.350 align:middle line:84%
You don't know-- and that
has a negative connotation,

00:30:19.350 --> 00:30:20.150 align:middle line:90%
I realize.

00:30:20.150 --> 00:30:23.990 align:middle line:84%
But the adaptivity
that we all have,

00:30:23.990 --> 00:30:25.340 align:middle line:90%
and it begins with the mind.

00:30:25.340 --> 00:30:27.860 align:middle line:84%
It begins with our relationship
to what's going on.

00:30:27.860 --> 00:30:29.630 align:middle line:84%
Because if we
perceive it constantly

00:30:29.630 --> 00:30:32.630 align:middle line:84%
from a place of
stress, versus, I

00:30:32.630 --> 00:30:35.030 align:middle line:84%
have followed my
guidance continuously,

00:30:35.030 --> 00:30:36.900 align:middle line:90%
I hear my guidance.

00:30:36.900 --> 00:30:38.550 align:middle line:84%
And if you don't
hear it completely,

00:30:38.550 --> 00:30:40.220 align:middle line:84%
know you're working
on your guidance.

00:30:40.220 --> 00:30:41.780 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Your
feeling will tell you.

00:30:41.780 --> 00:30:45.890 align:middle line:84%
>>BARSOTTI: Yes, and you
will unlock the next thing.

00:30:45.890 --> 00:30:48.620 align:middle line:84%
This is where trust and
faith really comes in,

00:30:48.620 --> 00:30:52.760 align:middle line:84%
is to, OK, you know what, I know
what's behind door number 1.

00:30:52.760 --> 00:30:54.480 align:middle line:90%
I keep choosing it.

00:30:54.480 --> 00:30:58.550 align:middle line:84%
So let me go into a new facet,
a new way of-- let me just

00:30:58.550 --> 00:30:59.780 align:middle line:90%
take a chance.

00:30:59.780 --> 00:31:01.430 align:middle line:90%
And I have a saying.

00:31:01.430 --> 00:31:03.723 align:middle line:84%
I actually was preparing
for this course

00:31:03.723 --> 00:31:05.390 align:middle line:84%
that I've been in the
midst of teaching,

00:31:05.390 --> 00:31:07.483 align:middle line:84%
the personal
self-integration course.

00:31:07.483 --> 00:31:09.650 align:middle line:84%
And it's a 12-week course
that I'm just wrapping up.

00:31:09.650 --> 00:31:14.180 align:middle line:84%
But in preparation for that, I
was reading one of these papers

00:31:14.180 --> 00:31:16.130 align:middle line:84%
I had written several
years ago about,

00:31:16.130 --> 00:31:19.250 align:middle line:84%
in the eye of the needle,
we are the thread.

00:31:19.250 --> 00:31:22.040 align:middle line:84%
And Carl Jung spoke to
a very distinct date.

00:31:22.040 --> 00:31:24.770 align:middle line:84%
Now, I forgot to look
up when he exactly died.

00:31:24.770 --> 00:31:27.560 align:middle line:84%
It was in the early '50s,
I think, is when he died.

00:31:27.560 --> 00:31:31.880 align:middle line:84%
He said 11/11/11 is a
key time for humanity.

00:31:31.880 --> 00:31:36.140 align:middle line:84%
And that it's narrow, if you
look it as a simple symbolism.

00:31:36.140 --> 00:31:38.360 align:middle line:84%
And that these are
like narrow portals.

00:31:38.360 --> 00:31:40.100 align:middle line:84%
And when we go
through these things,

00:31:40.100 --> 00:31:42.290 align:middle line:84%
we don't take our
baggage with us.

00:31:42.290 --> 00:31:45.740 align:middle line:84%
And that's the work,
is for us to remember

00:31:45.740 --> 00:31:53.623 align:middle line:84%
we are mostly just prismatics
of light, that we are--

00:31:53.623 --> 00:31:55.790 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Right, in the
very real scientific quantum

00:31:55.790 --> 00:31:57.420 align:middle line:90%
sense, that is all we are.

00:31:57.420 --> 00:31:58.220 align:middle line:90%
>>BARSOTTI: Yes.

00:31:58.220 --> 00:32:02.270 align:middle line:84%
And so when we lighten
our load and realize

00:32:02.270 --> 00:32:07.940 align:middle line:84%
that we are that light,
there's a different tenor

00:32:07.940 --> 00:32:10.070 align:middle line:90%
that comes over the whole body.

00:32:10.070 --> 00:32:12.650 align:middle line:90%
And we're guided differently.

00:32:12.650 --> 00:32:14.660 align:middle line:84%
And I don't have a
fear in the world

00:32:14.660 --> 00:32:16.980 align:middle line:90%
that we're going to be OK.

00:32:16.980 --> 00:32:17.810 align:middle line:90%
I just don't.

00:32:17.810 --> 00:32:19.790 align:middle line:90%
Is it totally crazy times?

00:32:19.790 --> 00:32:21.810 align:middle line:84%
Are people totally
against each other?

00:32:21.810 --> 00:32:25.010 align:middle line:84%
And we've got racism
to the 10th power,

00:32:25.010 --> 00:32:28.538 align:middle line:84%
again, we've got all this
happening with SARS-CoV-2,

00:32:28.538 --> 00:32:30.830 align:middle line:84%
and then whatever is going
to happen with the next time

00:32:30.830 --> 00:32:32.360 align:middle line:90%
that this comes around?

00:32:32.360 --> 00:32:36.380 align:middle line:84%
Because it's typical iof
viruses that these are--

00:32:36.380 --> 00:32:37.940 align:middle line:90%
they come back around.

00:32:37.940 --> 00:32:40.640 align:middle line:90%
And how do we develop ourselves?

00:32:40.640 --> 00:32:44.350 align:middle line:84%
Well, we develop ourselves with
our guidance first, I believe.

00:32:44.350 --> 00:32:45.680 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: I believe so, too.

00:32:45.680 --> 00:32:49.470 align:middle line:84%
And look at what's happening,
instinctively, as you mentioned

00:32:49.470 --> 00:32:50.640 align:middle line:90%
with the racial tensions.

00:32:50.640 --> 00:32:54.390 align:middle line:84%
We thought we were overcoming
that in the United States.

00:32:54.390 --> 00:32:55.660 align:middle line:90%
We weren't even close.

00:32:55.660 --> 00:32:57.870 align:middle line:84%
It has shown what has
been lurking there,

00:32:57.870 --> 00:32:59.970 align:middle line:90%
undealt with this whole time.

00:32:59.970 --> 00:33:01.950 align:middle line:84%
And it's never been
dealt with properly.

00:33:01.950 --> 00:33:05.670 align:middle line:84%
But now, really, I
think for the first time

00:33:05.670 --> 00:33:09.840 align:middle line:84%
in any serious sense,
people of all colors

00:33:09.840 --> 00:33:11.920 align:middle line:90%
are marching together.

00:33:11.920 --> 00:33:15.303 align:middle line:84%
And for the most part, they're
marching peacefully together.

00:33:15.303 --> 00:33:17.220 align:middle line:84%
There are always
opportunists and angry people

00:33:17.220 --> 00:33:19.380 align:middle line:84%
who will turn into
rioters and looters.

00:33:19.380 --> 00:33:22.330 align:middle line:84%
But that is not the spirit of
what's happening in the street.

00:33:22.330 --> 00:33:25.047 align:middle line:84%
And I've seen a couple
of them firsthand.

00:33:25.047 --> 00:33:26.880 align:middle line:84%
I've certainly watched
from around the world

00:33:26.880 --> 00:33:30.420 align:middle line:84%
as thousands, tens of
thousands of people

00:33:30.420 --> 00:33:32.910 align:middle line:84%
are gathering in the streets
for the first time to say,

00:33:32.910 --> 00:33:33.720 align:middle line:90%
enough is enough.

00:33:33.720 --> 00:33:35.820 align:middle line:90%
When do we all get to be humans?

00:33:35.820 --> 00:33:38.160 align:middle line:84%
When is it his right to
be a human like mine?

00:33:38.160 --> 00:33:40.190 align:middle line:84%
Because we've all
experienced it.

00:33:40.190 --> 00:33:41.190 align:middle line:90%
And it gets me very sa--

00:33:41.190 --> 00:33:42.960 align:middle line:84%
I mean, that's where
I get worked up.

00:33:42.960 --> 00:33:46.170 align:middle line:84%
I get very sad when it comes
to that kind of inequality.

00:33:46.170 --> 00:33:47.100 align:middle line:90%
So you have this.

00:33:47.100 --> 00:33:50.010 align:middle line:84%
You have now actions being
taken, again, in the United

00:33:50.010 --> 00:33:51.930 align:middle line:90%
States region by region.

00:33:51.930 --> 00:33:55.380 align:middle line:84%
In one region in Minnesota
saying, ugh, I'm stepping down.

00:33:55.380 --> 00:33:58.320 align:middle line:84%
This did not go well
on my watch and we

00:33:58.320 --> 00:34:00.840 align:middle line:84%
need to re-evaluate what
a police force is for.

00:34:00.840 --> 00:34:03.310 align:middle line:84%
When I was a kid, they were
called officers of the peace.

00:34:03.310 --> 00:34:06.717 align:middle line:84%
Now, many of them are behaving
in a militaristic way.

00:34:06.717 --> 00:34:07.800 align:middle line:90%
There's a reason for that.

00:34:07.800 --> 00:34:09.310 align:middle line:90%
They're being trained that way.

00:34:09.310 --> 00:34:11.429 align:middle line:84%
So now we look at that
and say, no, no more.

00:34:11.429 --> 00:34:13.500 align:middle line:90%
So I see the beauty in that.

00:34:13.500 --> 00:34:18.690 align:middle line:84%
And then just very recently, our
conservative Supreme Court just

00:34:18.690 --> 00:34:21.239 align:middle line:84%
did a landmark decision
that shocked everybody

00:34:21.239 --> 00:34:24.510 align:middle line:84%
in favor of expanded
and continued

00:34:24.510 --> 00:34:28.440 align:middle line:90%
rights for the LGBTQ community.

00:34:28.440 --> 00:34:29.850 align:middle line:90%
Who would have thought that?

00:34:29.850 --> 00:34:31.679 align:middle line:84%
We thought the
Supreme Court had been

00:34:31.679 --> 00:34:37.110 align:middle line:84%
stacked against that kind
of decision, 6 to 3 no less.

00:34:37.110 --> 00:34:41.100 align:middle line:84%
There are miracles
happening all around us now.

00:34:41.100 --> 00:34:44.850 align:middle line:84%
People are, I think on
such a deep level, getting,

00:34:44.850 --> 00:34:46.260 align:middle line:90%
we can't do this to people.

00:34:46.260 --> 00:34:48.389 align:middle line:84%
We can't do this to
each other anymore.

00:34:48.389 --> 00:34:52.810 align:middle line:84%
And that is the possibility
of these wrenching times.

00:34:52.810 --> 00:34:53.610 align:middle line:90%
>>BARSOTTI: Yes.

00:34:53.610 --> 00:34:55.980 align:middle line:84%
And I also think that that
plays into these times where

00:34:55.980 --> 00:34:59.430 align:middle line:84%
we were talking about,
the Aquarian times, what

00:34:59.430 --> 00:35:01.290 align:middle line:90%
we are waking up to.

00:35:01.290 --> 00:35:05.700 align:middle line:84%
And no, it's not just the divide
of colors and all of this.

00:35:05.700 --> 00:35:07.200 align:middle line:90%
It's humans.

00:35:07.200 --> 00:35:08.130 align:middle line:90%
Who are we?

00:35:08.130 --> 00:35:11.640 align:middle line:84%
And there's so much more
to uncover and discover

00:35:11.640 --> 00:35:13.500 align:middle line:90%
within ourselves.

00:35:13.500 --> 00:35:15.300 align:middle line:84%
And as we do that
work, we're going

00:35:15.300 --> 00:35:19.320 align:middle line:84%
to be able to do collective
consciousness so much better.

00:35:19.320 --> 00:35:21.270 align:middle line:90%
And that is where we're going.

00:35:21.270 --> 00:35:22.728 align:middle line:84%
And we're not being
Pollyanna here.

00:35:22.728 --> 00:35:24.103 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: No, this
is-- now we're

00:35:24.103 --> 00:35:26.400 align:middle line:84%
having to really pay our
dues, put our boots on, and do

00:35:26.400 --> 00:35:27.600 align:middle line:90%
this thing.

00:35:27.600 --> 00:35:30.030 align:middle line:84%
I'm going to be interviewing
Carl Calleman, whom

00:35:30.030 --> 00:35:31.440 align:middle line:90%
I have interviewed before.

00:35:31.440 --> 00:35:33.900 align:middle line:84%
And he's talking about the
ninth wave of consciousness,

00:35:33.900 --> 00:35:35.850 align:middle line:84%
and saying, hey, we've
been operating out

00:35:35.850 --> 00:35:38.580 align:middle line:84%
of a sixth wave--
patriarchy, structure,

00:35:38.580 --> 00:35:40.740 align:middle line:90%
technology, all of this.

00:35:40.740 --> 00:35:44.550 align:middle line:84%
But we have the opportunity
now to move our consciousness

00:35:44.550 --> 00:35:47.100 align:middle line:84%
into the ninth wave of
consciousness, which

00:35:47.100 --> 00:35:49.830 align:middle line:84%
is unity consciousness,
which is exactly what you're

00:35:49.830 --> 00:35:50.820 align:middle line:90%
talking about.

00:35:50.820 --> 00:35:52.860 align:middle line:84%
With all this
separation and division,

00:35:52.860 --> 00:35:56.190 align:middle line:84%
it's actually waking us
up to how we're unified

00:35:56.190 --> 00:36:00.738 align:middle line:90%
as a species, which I love.

00:36:00.738 --> 00:36:02.030 align:middle line:90%
>>BARSOTTI: It's very exciting.

00:36:02.030 --> 00:36:03.750 align:middle line:90%
It is very exciting.

00:36:03.750 --> 00:36:07.163 align:middle line:90%
The thing about the ninth wave--

00:36:07.163 --> 00:36:08.580 align:middle line:84%
because this
actually just came up

00:36:08.580 --> 00:36:10.215 align:middle line:84%
in the course I was
teaching, as well-- is like,

00:36:10.215 --> 00:36:12.570 align:middle line:84%
what is the difference
between individualization

00:36:12.570 --> 00:36:14.370 align:middle line:90%
and individuation?

00:36:14.370 --> 00:36:18.510 align:middle line:84%
And individualization, the way
that I would tease this out,

00:36:18.510 --> 00:36:23.160 align:middle line:84%
still has egotism
attached to it.

00:36:23.160 --> 00:36:24.720 align:middle line:84%
And we're still sort
of figuring out.

00:36:24.720 --> 00:36:26.020 align:middle line:90%
We're answering the call.

00:36:26.020 --> 00:36:29.300 align:middle line:84%
So if we think about this
from the heroic journey,

00:36:29.300 --> 00:36:30.630 align:middle line:90%
and we're answering the call.

00:36:30.630 --> 00:36:33.450 align:middle line:84%
And we have many iterations
of the hero's journey

00:36:33.450 --> 00:36:34.750 align:middle line:90%
in our lives.

00:36:34.750 --> 00:36:38.280 align:middle line:84%
And so as we're answering
the call, what's

00:36:38.280 --> 00:36:41.070 align:middle line:84%
our motivation to be able
to do what we're doing next?

00:36:41.070 --> 00:36:42.840 align:middle line:84%
Where are we being
motivated from?

00:36:42.840 --> 00:36:45.090 align:middle line:90%
Is it pure of heart?

00:36:45.090 --> 00:36:47.200 align:middle line:90%
And that's the thing to go back.

00:36:47.200 --> 00:36:48.930 align:middle line:84%
And also, when
we're questioning,

00:36:48.930 --> 00:36:50.610 align:middle line:90%
what intuition, what's ego?

00:36:50.610 --> 00:36:52.940 align:middle line:84%
What is-- is this
a separating idea

00:36:52.940 --> 00:36:55.000 align:middle line:90%
or is this a joining with idea?

00:36:55.000 --> 00:36:55.800 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Exactly.

00:36:55.800 --> 00:36:56.770 align:middle line:90%
I couldn't agree more.

00:36:56.770 --> 00:36:59.670 align:middle line:84%
I just had a text exchange
with a friend last night.

00:36:59.670 --> 00:37:02.790 align:middle line:84%
We're, you can say,
kind of sociopolitically

00:37:02.790 --> 00:37:04.750 align:middle line:90%
on opposite sides of the fence.

00:37:04.750 --> 00:37:08.557 align:middle line:84%
And she was saying, well,
I bet this and this,

00:37:08.557 --> 00:37:10.140 align:middle line:84%
trying to kind of
see how I'd respond.

00:37:10.140 --> 00:37:12.687 align:middle line:84%
I said, you know, when
it comes down to it,

00:37:12.687 --> 00:37:13.770 align:middle line:90%
we can think what we want.

00:37:13.770 --> 00:37:17.070 align:middle line:84%
But I think our
real information is

00:37:17.070 --> 00:37:20.040 align:middle line:84%
going to come from the
heart, what's motivating us.

00:37:20.040 --> 00:37:22.590 align:middle line:84%
Where is our heart in all
this, which is exactly what you

00:37:22.590 --> 00:37:23.880 align:middle line:90%
were just saying.

00:37:23.880 --> 00:37:28.440 align:middle line:84%
Because in the end, the
notion of the virtue--

00:37:28.440 --> 00:37:30.750 align:middle line:90%
we can't trust truth anymore.

00:37:30.750 --> 00:37:33.540 align:middle line:84%
On my own website, it
says, truth matters.

00:37:33.540 --> 00:37:35.040 align:middle line:90%
Well, it does to me.

00:37:35.040 --> 00:37:36.250 align:middle line:90%
But then what is truth?

00:37:36.250 --> 00:37:39.750 align:middle line:84%
Now we're starting to
get down to, whose truth?

00:37:39.750 --> 00:37:42.570 align:middle line:90%
Where was it generated from?

00:37:42.570 --> 00:37:44.900 align:middle line:84%
But what does stand
the test of time

00:37:44.900 --> 00:37:51.530 align:middle line:84%
is kindness, inclusivity,
compassion, the virtues that

00:37:51.530 --> 00:37:53.690 align:middle line:90%
really emanate from the heart.

00:37:53.690 --> 00:37:55.250 align:middle line:84%
And you are so
right when you say,

00:37:55.250 --> 00:37:59.000 align:middle line:84%
if we're using that
as our lens to discern

00:37:59.000 --> 00:38:00.830 align:middle line:84%
for ourselves through,
we're probably going

00:38:00.830 --> 00:38:02.290 align:middle line:90%
to end up in pretty good shape.

00:38:02.290 --> 00:38:04.040 align:middle line:84%
And that's what's
happening as people join

00:38:04.040 --> 00:38:05.390 align:middle line:90%
hands in the streets together.

00:38:05.390 --> 00:38:06.840 align:middle line:84%
They're coming
from their hearts.

00:38:06.840 --> 00:38:09.800 align:middle line:84%
>>BARSOTTI: Yeah,
honestly, we're weaving--

00:38:09.800 --> 00:38:12.950 align:middle line:84%
as we get more
comfortable with the fact

00:38:12.950 --> 00:38:16.040 align:middle line:84%
that the wound ultimately
becomes our genius,

00:38:16.040 --> 00:38:18.890 align:middle line:84%
and that gets woven
into our tapestry.

00:38:18.890 --> 00:38:23.120 align:middle line:84%
And I mean like a unity, kind
of like what that actually

00:38:23.120 --> 00:38:24.050 align:middle line:90%
really means.

00:38:24.050 --> 00:38:27.680 align:middle line:84%
So as we do that,
we can find comfort.

00:38:27.680 --> 00:38:30.290 align:middle line:84%
I don't believe that
we can effectively

00:38:30.290 --> 00:38:33.440 align:middle line:84%
do group consciousness
until we have a better

00:38:33.440 --> 00:38:36.210 align:middle line:90%
understanding as to who we are.

00:38:36.210 --> 00:38:38.420 align:middle line:90%
And that's the mission of--

00:38:38.420 --> 00:38:41.330 align:middle line:84%
I think what we're in right
now, about this very essence

00:38:41.330 --> 00:38:43.580 align:middle line:84%
of what's truth,
and who's saying it

00:38:43.580 --> 00:38:45.200 align:middle line:90%
and what's their agenda.

00:38:45.200 --> 00:38:47.720 align:middle line:84%
And is that true for
me, really going back

00:38:47.720 --> 00:38:49.550 align:middle line:84%
to-- if there's
a takeaway here--

00:38:49.550 --> 00:38:52.490 align:middle line:84%
going back to, do
I have any evidence

00:38:52.490 --> 00:38:54.350 align:middle line:90%
of that being truth in my life?

00:38:54.350 --> 00:38:56.210 align:middle line:84%
Or am I just
accepting that this is

00:38:56.210 --> 00:38:59.120 align:middle line:84%
what's being told to me
because it's somebody else's

00:38:59.120 --> 00:39:01.610 align:middle line:84%
truth, based on an agenda
that I couldn't possibly know,

00:39:01.610 --> 00:39:05.690 align:middle line:84%
that's so scattered with
so many other agendas?

00:39:05.690 --> 00:39:08.300 align:middle line:84%
And who's pulling the
strings behind that one?

00:39:08.300 --> 00:39:09.230 align:middle line:90%
It's crazy-making.

00:39:09.230 --> 00:39:10.400 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: That's where
you go to the heart.

00:39:10.400 --> 00:39:11.200 align:middle line:90%
The heart knows.

00:39:11.200 --> 00:39:13.520 align:middle line:90%
>>BARSOTTI: Come back to center.

00:39:13.520 --> 00:39:14.660 align:middle line:90%
What's in love?

00:39:14.660 --> 00:39:19.100 align:middle line:84%
What do you know from your
essence that comes from love?

00:39:19.100 --> 00:39:21.500 align:middle line:90%
And let that be the motivator.

00:39:21.500 --> 00:39:24.050 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: That really cuts
through virtually every agenda,

00:39:24.050 --> 00:39:26.660 align:middle line:90%
honestly.

00:39:26.660 --> 00:39:28.993 align:middle line:84%
And it tells you where to put
your energy and your time,

00:39:28.993 --> 00:39:29.793 align:middle line:90%
really.

00:39:29.793 --> 00:39:31.340 align:middle line:84%
It gives you very
practical guidance.

00:39:31.340 --> 00:39:33.320 align:middle line:84%
One of the things that
you were suggesting

00:39:33.320 --> 00:39:38.270 align:middle line:84%
is that, we're entering into the
evolution of the age of grace.

00:39:38.270 --> 00:39:40.032 align:middle line:84%
So we just talked about
love a little bit.

00:39:40.032 --> 00:39:41.990 align:middle line:84%
So I think this is a good
segue way to go into.

00:39:41.990 --> 00:39:43.220 align:middle line:90%
What does that mean?

00:39:43.220 --> 00:39:44.660 align:middle line:90%
What is the age of grace?

00:39:44.660 --> 00:39:47.750 align:middle line:84%
>>BARSOTTI: So where this
came from, this was really--

00:39:47.750 --> 00:39:52.190 align:middle line:84%
this was weeks of
contemplation, as well.

00:39:52.190 --> 00:39:54.950 align:middle line:84%
As you know, I studied
with Caroline Myss and Norm

00:39:54.950 --> 00:39:57.220 align:middle line:90%
Shealy and many other--

00:39:57.220 --> 00:40:00.170 align:middle line:84%
I'll call them modern
mystics at Holos University.

00:40:00.170 --> 00:40:06.860 align:middle line:84%
And I had the fun fortune of
doing a lot within archetypes.

00:40:06.860 --> 00:40:08.900 align:middle line:84%
And Jung wrote about
this, Ed Ettinger.

00:40:08.900 --> 00:40:12.200 align:middle line:84%
Many people write about these
sort of survival archetypes.

00:40:12.200 --> 00:40:15.830 align:middle line:84%
And as I studied them
more, I was like, whew,

00:40:15.830 --> 00:40:18.440 align:middle line:84%
I really want to be
done with this model.

00:40:18.440 --> 00:40:19.760 align:middle line:90%
Where are we going?

00:40:19.760 --> 00:40:22.010 align:middle line:84%
And this is another
really important thing,

00:40:22.010 --> 00:40:25.010 align:middle line:84%
because we do need to have
this understanding of,

00:40:25.010 --> 00:40:27.170 align:middle line:90%
where are we going?

00:40:27.170 --> 00:40:31.550 align:middle line:84%
And so this was born out of
this questioning of myself.

00:40:31.550 --> 00:40:35.930 align:middle line:84%
And as we evolve out of
the archetypes of survival,

00:40:35.930 --> 00:40:38.450 align:middle line:90%
which are victim, persecutor--

00:40:38.450 --> 00:40:43.550 align:middle line:84%
sorry, victim, saboteur,
inner child, and prostitute.

00:40:43.550 --> 00:40:47.960 align:middle line:84%
So as we evolve out of them,
what are we evolving into?

00:40:47.960 --> 00:40:52.790 align:middle line:84%
And so what got downloaded
to me very quickly was, oh,

00:40:52.790 --> 00:40:54.290 align:middle line:90%
the archetypes of grace.

00:40:54.290 --> 00:40:58.040 align:middle line:84%
OK, well, as we evolve them,
what exactly does that mean?

00:40:58.040 --> 00:41:04.730 align:middle line:84%
And when we are feeling into,
I can't operate from that same

00:41:04.730 --> 00:41:08.570 align:middle line:84%
model anymore, so if I can't
prostitute myself and I

00:41:08.570 --> 00:41:13.030 align:middle line:84%
can't show up in that same
job anymore, and oh, my god,

00:41:13.030 --> 00:41:16.040 align:middle line:84%
every part of my body just
cannot do that job anymore--

00:41:16.040 --> 00:41:17.540 align:middle line:90%
how many people are saying that?

00:41:17.540 --> 00:41:19.790 align:middle line:84%
They can't sit in
the traffic anymore.

00:41:19.790 --> 00:41:22.520 align:middle line:84%
They don't want it to go
back to the way that it was.

00:41:22.520 --> 00:41:25.190 align:middle line:84%
And so all right, so if
I'm not prostituting myself

00:41:25.190 --> 00:41:29.390 align:middle line:84%
for a paycheck anymore, then
who am I if I'm being authentic?

00:41:29.390 --> 00:41:33.902 align:middle line:84%
And that's the archetype
that's moving into grace.

00:41:33.902 --> 00:41:37.370 align:middle line:84%
It's, the prostitute moves
into the authentic self.

00:41:37.370 --> 00:41:41.330 align:middle line:84%
And that, well, now we're
asking a much deeper question.

00:41:41.330 --> 00:41:42.650 align:middle line:90%
What's my truth?

00:41:42.650 --> 00:41:44.420 align:middle line:90%
Who am I authentically?

00:41:44.420 --> 00:41:47.360 align:middle line:84%
What is it that I actually
want to put out in the world?

00:41:47.360 --> 00:41:49.380 align:middle line:84%
Is there a problem
for me to solve?

00:41:49.380 --> 00:41:52.730 align:middle line:84%
Is there something
that I am feeling

00:41:52.730 --> 00:41:55.550 align:middle line:84%
like, I can't do my
teaching gig the way

00:41:55.550 --> 00:41:58.220 align:middle line:84%
that I was, I can't do my
advertising gig the way

00:41:58.220 --> 00:41:59.360 align:middle line:90%
that I used to?

00:41:59.360 --> 00:42:04.730 align:middle line:84%
Whatever that money-making
job was, if it's in alignment,

00:42:04.730 --> 00:42:05.960 align:middle line:90%
fabulous.

00:42:05.960 --> 00:42:08.000 align:middle line:84%
But if it's no
longer in alignment,

00:42:08.000 --> 00:42:09.980 align:middle line:84%
then there's a
deeper questioning,

00:42:09.980 --> 00:42:11.780 align:middle line:84%
and to get right
with your own river

00:42:11.780 --> 00:42:15.295 align:middle line:84%
and go in the direction
of that creative river.

00:42:15.295 --> 00:42:16.170 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Absolutely.

00:42:16.170 --> 00:42:18.140 align:middle line:84%
And this is going to
have to also happen

00:42:18.140 --> 00:42:20.900 align:middle line:90%
at the institutional levels.

00:42:20.900 --> 00:42:24.230 align:middle line:84%
Because right now, we're
looking at a time of automation.

00:42:24.230 --> 00:42:26.387 align:middle line:84%
We're looking at companies,
for example, they've

00:42:26.387 --> 00:42:28.220 align:middle line:84%
been struggling for a
long time, and they're

00:42:28.220 --> 00:42:33.320 align:middle line:84%
using COVID as the opportunity
to either downscale or to quit.

00:42:33.320 --> 00:42:36.320 align:middle line:84%
And we're seeing this from
the tiniest of businesses,

00:42:36.320 --> 00:42:38.510 align:middle line:84%
little dog grooming
parlors, all the way up

00:42:38.510 --> 00:42:42.440 align:middle line:84%
to giant department
store chains.

00:42:42.440 --> 00:42:46.957 align:middle line:84%
So how do we start
employing this collectively?

00:42:46.957 --> 00:42:48.540 align:middle line:84%
When you're in a
situation where we're

00:42:48.540 --> 00:42:50.100 align:middle line:84%
going to go to
increased automation,

00:42:50.100 --> 00:42:53.400 align:middle line:84%
meaning millions and millions of
jobs are going to go away now--

00:42:53.400 --> 00:42:56.730 align:middle line:84%
they already have, and millions
more are going to go away--

00:42:56.730 --> 00:42:58.410 align:middle line:90%
where does that leave humanity?

00:42:58.410 --> 00:42:59.650 align:middle line:90%
Are we here to work?

00:42:59.650 --> 00:43:02.130 align:middle line:90%
Are we here to work for the man?

00:43:02.130 --> 00:43:04.830 align:middle line:84%
Is that what we as human
beings and souls are here for,

00:43:04.830 --> 00:43:07.200 align:middle line:90%
is to work for a living?

00:43:07.200 --> 00:43:09.360 align:middle line:90%
No, that's not our sole purpose.

00:43:09.360 --> 00:43:14.280 align:middle line:84%
So the whole notion of this mass
level of connected creativity

00:43:14.280 --> 00:43:20.070 align:middle line:84%
and unification of beings,
of thought, has to happen.

00:43:20.070 --> 00:43:22.020 align:middle line:90%
It's not like it's a choice now.

00:43:22.020 --> 00:43:25.867 align:middle line:84%
What do you do when millions of
people's jobs no longer exist?

00:43:25.867 --> 00:43:26.700 align:middle line:90%
>>BARSOTTI: Exactly.

00:43:26.700 --> 00:43:29.242 align:middle line:84%
And the government isn't going
to be able to employ everyone.

00:43:29.242 --> 00:43:31.533 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And the government
can't keep doing bailouts,

00:43:31.533 --> 00:43:33.630 align:middle line:84%
because we're already
beyond hope on that one.

00:43:33.630 --> 00:43:34.720 align:middle line:90%
Can't ever pay it back.

00:43:34.720 --> 00:43:37.740 align:middle line:84%
>>BARSOTTI: So this is where
we get into that center.

00:43:37.740 --> 00:43:39.510 align:middle line:84%
And it's just like,
OK, since I can't

00:43:39.510 --> 00:43:41.850 align:middle line:84%
operate from that
old paradigm anymore,

00:43:41.850 --> 00:43:43.590 align:middle line:90%
what's waking up inside me?

00:43:43.590 --> 00:43:46.190 align:middle line:84%
What's the thing that I always
knew that I wanted to do,

00:43:46.190 --> 00:43:48.270 align:middle line:84%
but maybe had too
much fear around,

00:43:48.270 --> 00:43:52.770 align:middle line:84%
or the new idea, the thing that
has dawned on me now, that,

00:43:52.770 --> 00:43:54.510 align:middle line:90%
oh, now's the time for that?

00:43:54.510 --> 00:43:57.900 align:middle line:84%
It maybe wasn't the time
when I first had the idea.

00:43:57.900 --> 00:43:59.670 align:middle line:90%
But now is the time.

00:43:59.670 --> 00:44:01.260 align:middle line:90%
This is now ripe.

00:44:01.260 --> 00:44:02.060 align:middle line:90%
This takes courage.

00:44:02.060 --> 00:44:03.560 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: It takes
a lot of courage,

00:44:03.560 --> 00:44:06.240 align:middle line:84%
because it means circumstances
generally have to change around

00:44:06.240 --> 00:44:07.050 align:middle line:90%
it to support it.

00:44:07.050 --> 00:44:07.850 align:middle line:90%
>>BARSOTTI: Yes.

00:44:07.850 --> 00:44:10.830 align:middle line:84%
And the courage sort
of ignites that flame.

00:44:10.830 --> 00:44:11.970 align:middle line:90%
It will get it going.

00:44:11.970 --> 00:44:13.440 align:middle line:84%
And I love Brene
Brown's teachings

00:44:13.440 --> 00:44:15.357 align:middle line:84%
on courage and vulnerability,
that they really

00:44:15.357 --> 00:44:16.800 align:middle line:90%
go hand-in-hand.

00:44:16.800 --> 00:44:17.700 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: They do.

00:44:17.700 --> 00:44:19.320 align:middle line:84%
>>BARSOTTI: Yes,
you can't separate.

00:44:19.320 --> 00:44:21.000 align:middle line:84%
And it's just like,
sometimes when

00:44:21.000 --> 00:44:23.647 align:middle line:84%
I teach the drama triangle--
or getting out of the drama

00:44:23.647 --> 00:44:25.980 align:middle line:84%
triangle, which I call the
empowered surrender triangle,

00:44:25.980 --> 00:44:27.360 align:middle line:90%
which was another download.

00:44:27.360 --> 00:44:29.880 align:middle line:84%
But that was-- people
really took issue

00:44:29.880 --> 00:44:31.450 align:middle line:90%
with the word surrender.

00:44:31.450 --> 00:44:32.350 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Why?

00:44:32.350 --> 00:44:33.758 align:middle line:90%
>>BARSOTTI: That it was like--

00:44:33.758 --> 00:44:34.800 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Like giving up?

00:44:34.800 --> 00:44:36.630 align:middle line:84%
>>BARSOTTI: --acqueising
control and power.

00:44:36.630 --> 00:44:38.910 align:middle line:84%
And it's like, no,
it's the opposite.

00:44:38.910 --> 00:44:41.670 align:middle line:84%
But this is why
I believe that we

00:44:41.670 --> 00:44:44.310 align:middle line:84%
have to know our own
will before we can

00:44:44.310 --> 00:44:46.650 align:middle line:90%
let divine will will thy will.

00:44:46.650 --> 00:44:49.205 align:middle line:90%
So it's about a collective will.

00:44:49.205 --> 00:44:50.080 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Absolutely.

00:44:50.080 --> 00:44:51.510 align:middle line:84%
And you're teaching
a new course,

00:44:51.510 --> 00:44:54.000 align:middle line:84%
and it's about merging
personality with soul.

00:44:54.000 --> 00:44:55.890 align:middle line:84%
This is where I
think that comes in.

00:44:55.890 --> 00:44:58.590 align:middle line:84%
Because these feelings we
have, these subtle feelings--

00:44:58.590 --> 00:45:01.590 align:middle line:84%
I don't want to do this, my
being can't do it anymore,

00:45:01.590 --> 00:45:04.380 align:middle line:84%
and I haven't had a chance
to express the thing I really

00:45:04.380 --> 00:45:05.700 align:middle line:90%
want to express--

00:45:05.700 --> 00:45:09.180 align:middle line:84%
that's a deep yearning in
so many people right now.

00:45:09.180 --> 00:45:11.070 align:middle line:84%
But the personality
continues on,

00:45:11.070 --> 00:45:12.845 align:middle line:84%
in its set form,
trying to continue on

00:45:12.845 --> 00:45:14.220 align:middle line:84%
in the way that's
the most secure

00:45:14.220 --> 00:45:16.320 align:middle line:84%
for hearth and
home and all that.

00:45:16.320 --> 00:45:19.680 align:middle line:84%
How do you begin
merging your true self,

00:45:19.680 --> 00:45:22.290 align:middle line:84%
those subtle impulses
from the soul--

00:45:22.290 --> 00:45:24.300 align:middle line:90%
and not so subtle impulses--

00:45:24.300 --> 00:45:28.030 align:middle line:84%
with the personality that's
expressing itself in the world?

00:45:28.030 --> 00:45:29.280 align:middle line:90%
Because I find it challenging.

00:45:29.280 --> 00:45:31.650 align:middle line:84%
If you went to a
meditation, it's like, woo,

00:45:31.650 --> 00:45:36.880 align:middle line:84%
you can be anywhere, blissed,
beyond that, undifferentiated

00:45:36.880 --> 00:45:37.680 align:middle line:90%
even.

00:45:37.680 --> 00:45:40.550 align:middle line:84%
But you come back in, and
someone cut you off in traffic.

00:45:40.550 --> 00:45:42.113 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHTER]

00:45:42.113 --> 00:45:43.030 align:middle line:90%
>>BARSOTTI: It's true.

00:45:43.030 --> 00:45:46.840 align:middle line:84%
And Pema Chodron has a
great teaching on patience.

00:45:46.840 --> 00:45:50.640 align:middle line:84%
She says, if you're going to
try and teach yourself patience,

00:45:50.640 --> 00:45:53.340 align:middle line:84%
don't do it with the most
challenging relationship you

00:45:53.340 --> 00:45:54.210 align:middle line:90%
have.

00:45:54.210 --> 00:45:55.668 align:middle line:84%
Teach yourself
patience in traffic.

00:45:55.668 --> 00:45:57.630 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: In the little
things, in traffic--

00:45:57.630 --> 00:45:58.430 align:middle line:90%
I agree.

00:45:58.430 --> 00:46:00.990 align:middle line:84%
>>BARSOTTI: And we're
working our way towards that.

00:46:00.990 --> 00:46:04.770 align:middle line:84%
We have to, I believe,
embrace our personality.

00:46:04.770 --> 00:46:07.660 align:middle line:84%
But there's the shadow that
goes with this, as well.

00:46:07.660 --> 00:46:10.410 align:middle line:90%
And there are a lot of people--

00:46:10.410 --> 00:46:12.300 align:middle line:84%
we've spoken about
this in the past--

00:46:12.300 --> 00:46:14.850 align:middle line:90%
where they have done--

00:46:14.850 --> 00:46:16.080 align:middle line:90%
skipped over so much.

00:46:16.080 --> 00:46:20.550 align:middle line:84%
They had the bliss experience
in their meditations.

00:46:20.550 --> 00:46:22.800 align:middle line:84%
But they didn't incorporate
any of the shadow yet.

00:46:22.800 --> 00:46:25.500 align:middle line:84%
Well, at some point, that's
got to get incorporated.

00:46:25.500 --> 00:46:27.390 align:middle line:90%
And what I actually--

00:46:27.390 --> 00:46:30.090 align:middle line:84%
Richard Rudd speaks to
this, of the gene keys.

00:46:30.090 --> 00:46:33.780 align:middle line:84%
He speaks about that, what
Kundalini energy is actually

00:46:33.780 --> 00:46:35.550 align:middle line:90%
the rising up of shadows.

00:46:35.550 --> 00:46:37.320 align:middle line:90%
And I agree with that.

00:46:37.320 --> 00:46:39.050 align:middle line:84%
And this is why it
can hit so much.

00:46:39.050 --> 00:46:40.140 align:middle line:90%
Yes, it's pure energy.

00:46:40.140 --> 00:46:41.670 align:middle line:90%
Yes, it's pure potential.

00:46:41.670 --> 00:46:43.830 align:middle line:90%
Yes, it can be enlightening.

00:46:43.830 --> 00:46:46.200 align:middle line:84%
And it can also
really stir the pot.

00:46:46.200 --> 00:46:50.730 align:middle line:84%
And we want that pot stirred,
because whatever it needs,

00:46:50.730 --> 00:46:54.240 align:middle line:84%
whatever that crusty stuff
is of the bottom, that's

00:46:54.240 --> 00:46:56.880 align:middle line:84%
what we need to do so that we're
not continuing to do the drama

00:46:56.880 --> 00:46:59.520 align:middle line:90%
triangle and the karmic wheel.

00:46:59.520 --> 00:47:02.530 align:middle line:84%
And it's time to
get on with this.

00:47:02.530 --> 00:47:04.500 align:middle line:84%
>>BARSOTTI: So in your
course, what do people

00:47:04.500 --> 00:47:10.410 align:middle line:84%
experience to start
enfolding the shadow in?

00:47:10.410 --> 00:47:13.470 align:middle line:84%
What does that look like, so
that you can merge more purely

00:47:13.470 --> 00:47:14.370 align:middle line:90%
with the soul?

00:47:14.370 --> 00:47:16.090 align:middle line:90%
>>BARSOTTI: The aha first.

00:47:16.090 --> 00:47:19.060 align:middle line:84%
And you know, Maslow spoke
about the peak experience.

00:47:19.060 --> 00:47:21.210 align:middle line:90%
And to me, that's the aha.

00:47:21.210 --> 00:47:29.370 align:middle line:84%
It's like, oh, wow, OK, I cannot
go and inflame this same person

00:47:29.370 --> 00:47:33.090 align:middle line:84%
where that used to be the
dynamic that made me thrive.

00:47:33.090 --> 00:47:35.040 align:middle line:84%
And those fights
that I used to pick

00:47:35.040 --> 00:47:37.800 align:middle line:84%
with people that actually
gave me energy, now

00:47:37.800 --> 00:47:39.090 align:middle line:90%
actually tear me down.

00:47:39.090 --> 00:47:40.930 align:middle line:90%
I can't deal with it anymore.

00:47:40.930 --> 00:47:43.620 align:middle line:84%
I don't want to plug
in in that same way.

00:47:43.620 --> 00:47:46.840 align:middle line:84%
Or it's not necessarily
what's in my course,

00:47:46.840 --> 00:47:48.250 align:middle line:90%
about the angry piece.

00:47:48.250 --> 00:47:50.800 align:middle line:84%
However, we do need to
get in touch with anger.

00:47:50.800 --> 00:47:52.450 align:middle line:84%
Because the appropriate
use of anger

00:47:52.450 --> 00:47:54.310 align:middle line:84%
is to set appropriate
boundaries.

00:47:54.310 --> 00:47:56.680 align:middle line:84%
And that's also
necessary for the empath,

00:47:56.680 --> 00:47:59.170 align:middle line:84%
is to have good boundaries
and to be able--

00:47:59.170 --> 00:48:02.200 align:middle line:84%
so a lot of this, that emergence
and the emergent quality

00:48:02.200 --> 00:48:04.630 align:middle line:84%
out of the course, was
courage, which was curious.

00:48:04.630 --> 00:48:07.780 align:middle line:84%
I didn't know yet what was
going to emerge out of that.

00:48:07.780 --> 00:48:11.260 align:middle line:84%
And the courage
is to be yourself.

00:48:11.260 --> 00:48:12.620 align:middle line:90%
What is the personality?

00:48:12.620 --> 00:48:14.990 align:middle line:90%
Own the shadow aspects?

00:48:14.990 --> 00:48:18.250 align:middle line:90%
And those ahas that come--

00:48:18.250 --> 00:48:19.120 align:middle line:90%
there were so many.

00:48:19.120 --> 00:48:21.550 align:middle line:84%
I'm having a hard time
landing on one right now.

00:48:21.550 --> 00:48:25.930 align:middle line:84%
But they're this
essence of remembering,

00:48:25.930 --> 00:48:28.810 align:middle line:84%
oh, I'm here to be
this creative person.

00:48:28.810 --> 00:48:31.870 align:middle line:84%
I don't want to plug into
the man's model anymore.

00:48:31.870 --> 00:48:33.260 align:middle line:90%
And I just can't do it.

00:48:33.260 --> 00:48:37.900 align:middle line:84%
I can't do the
agendized method or way

00:48:37.900 --> 00:48:42.100 align:middle line:84%
or industrialized
reductionistic model of how it

00:48:42.100 --> 00:48:43.370 align:middle line:90%
is that we used to do things.

00:48:43.370 --> 00:48:44.170 align:middle line:90%
I can't.

00:48:44.170 --> 00:48:45.580 align:middle line:90%
That egg broke.

00:48:45.580 --> 00:48:46.570 align:middle line:90%
I can't do it.

00:48:46.570 --> 00:48:47.612 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: That egg broke.

00:48:47.612 --> 00:48:50.785 align:middle line:84%
And a lot of eggs broke,
because also people,

00:48:50.785 --> 00:48:53.860 align:middle line:84%
in being cast into the situation
where we were isolated,

00:48:53.860 --> 00:48:56.500 align:middle line:84%
sometimes with people we
don't get on that well with,

00:48:56.500 --> 00:48:58.660 align:middle line:84%
many things broke
within us to say,

00:48:58.660 --> 00:49:02.680 align:middle line:84%
I can't be that person that
you're demanding of me anymore.

00:49:02.680 --> 00:49:05.470 align:middle line:84%
This is a really big win
for women, is to say,

00:49:05.470 --> 00:49:07.750 align:middle line:84%
you know what, I've been
trying to be what you want.

00:49:07.750 --> 00:49:09.970 align:middle line:90%
And I can't do it anymore.

00:49:09.970 --> 00:49:10.880 align:middle line:90%
I'm not capable.

00:49:10.880 --> 00:49:13.300 align:middle line:84%
>>BARSOTTI: The no--
that was a piece

00:49:13.300 --> 00:49:18.340 align:middle line:84%
that I was so pleased that
it emerged, but I would not

00:49:18.340 --> 00:49:20.650 align:middle line:84%
have predicted it, in
this personality, soul

00:49:20.650 --> 00:49:23.110 align:middle line:90%
conversation that we're having.

00:49:23.110 --> 00:49:26.350 align:middle line:90%
When is the appropriate no?

00:49:26.350 --> 00:49:32.650 align:middle line:84%
And a lot of people are saying
no, whether their political,

00:49:32.650 --> 00:49:36.250 align:middle line:84%
to their sociopolitical
relationship,

00:49:36.250 --> 00:49:38.635 align:middle line:84%
to the people that they
usually said yes to,

00:49:38.635 --> 00:49:41.410 align:middle line:84%
to the people that their
contracts depended on.

00:49:41.410 --> 00:49:44.140 align:middle line:84%
It's just like, wow, I
just can't do that anymore.

00:49:44.140 --> 00:49:46.570 align:middle line:84%
The tolerance
level, the threshold

00:49:46.570 --> 00:49:48.700 align:middle line:84%
has just gotten
much more crunched.

00:49:48.700 --> 00:49:49.750 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: It really has.

00:49:49.750 --> 00:49:52.795 align:middle line:84%
>>BARSOTTI: And so that
ability to say no--

00:49:52.795 --> 00:49:55.420 align:middle line:84%
and then it's like, oh, my god,
that just came out of my mouth.

00:49:55.420 --> 00:49:57.470 align:middle line:90%
[GASPS] What does that mean?

00:49:57.470 --> 00:49:58.270 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: It is.

00:49:58.270 --> 00:49:59.140 align:middle line:90%
It's fascinating.

00:49:59.140 --> 00:50:00.723 align:middle line:84%
Because people, once
they were quiet--

00:50:00.723 --> 00:50:03.182 align:middle line:84%
and they couldn't really move
around much in the beginning.

00:50:03.182 --> 00:50:04.840 align:middle line:90%
Everyone was frightened, right?

00:50:04.840 --> 00:50:06.850 align:middle line:84%
Oh, stay indoors, keep
your masks on indoors

00:50:06.850 --> 00:50:07.650 align:middle line:90%
if you have to.

00:50:07.650 --> 00:50:10.420 align:middle line:90%


00:50:10.420 --> 00:50:12.820 align:middle line:84%
This quiet that
started settling in

00:50:12.820 --> 00:50:15.760 align:middle line:84%
that we talked about in the
very beginning, people maybe

00:50:15.760 --> 00:50:19.000 align:middle line:84%
kind of antsy, like what
do I do with my days,

00:50:19.000 --> 00:50:19.990 align:middle line:90%
they figured it out.

00:50:19.990 --> 00:50:21.910 align:middle line:84%
You figured out what
to do with your days.

00:50:21.910 --> 00:50:27.250 align:middle line:84%
But this sense of peace of being
more left alone with yourself,

00:50:27.250 --> 00:50:30.100 align:middle line:84%
and how much of your
energy is exhausted

00:50:30.100 --> 00:50:35.380 align:middle line:84%
by pleasing others, in every
way, in every single way.

00:50:35.380 --> 00:50:37.990 align:middle line:84%
And so reclaiming that
part seems to me--

00:50:37.990 --> 00:50:39.670 align:middle line:84%
I think just
recognizing that has

00:50:39.670 --> 00:50:44.540 align:middle line:84%
been one of the great gifts
of the COVID season of 2020,

00:50:44.540 --> 00:50:45.340 align:middle line:90%
right?

00:50:45.340 --> 00:50:46.660 align:middle line:90%
>>BARSOTTI: Agreed, agreed.

00:50:46.660 --> 00:50:48.160 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Because
that's energy that

00:50:48.160 --> 00:50:50.470 align:middle line:84%
could be used toward
creativity, that

00:50:50.470 --> 00:50:55.270 align:middle line:84%
could be used for being able
to be of assistance, to open

00:50:55.270 --> 00:50:57.040 align:middle line:84%
up and see each
other more clearly,

00:50:57.040 --> 00:51:00.340 align:middle line:84%
just purely exhausted
trying to please each other.

00:51:00.340 --> 00:51:01.300 align:middle line:90%
>>BARSOTTI: Exactly.

00:51:01.300 --> 00:51:05.480 align:middle line:84%
And it's just not tolerable
as much as it used to be.

00:51:05.480 --> 00:51:06.280 align:middle line:90%
It's

00:51:06.280 --> 00:51:06.610 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Not.

00:51:06.610 --> 00:51:07.485 align:middle line:90%
>>BARSOTTI: It's not.

00:51:07.485 --> 00:51:10.840 align:middle line:84%
And that gives
the rise to this--

00:51:10.840 --> 00:51:14.380 align:middle line:84%
I say about it,
the anxiety piece,

00:51:14.380 --> 00:51:16.240 align:middle line:84%
anxiety isn't just
a single emotion.

00:51:16.240 --> 00:51:20.950 align:middle line:84%
I actually-- I go totally
against what is in the DSM 5

00:51:20.950 --> 00:51:23.980 align:middle line:84%
and in the typical
literature when you look up

00:51:23.980 --> 00:51:26.070 align:middle line:90%
anxiety and depression.

00:51:26.070 --> 00:51:29.380 align:middle line:84%
And we have spoken some
about this in the past.

00:51:29.380 --> 00:51:34.600 align:middle line:84%
But I see it as a collection
of memories, of memories

00:51:34.600 --> 00:51:37.750 align:middle line:84%
that the body hangs on to like
little eddies, like a fast--

00:51:37.750 --> 00:51:40.540 align:middle line:84%
I really like the
analogy of like class

00:51:40.540 --> 00:51:44.500 align:middle line:84%
5 rapids, that we all have
that creative energy moving

00:51:44.500 --> 00:51:45.850 align:middle line:90%
within us.

00:51:45.850 --> 00:51:50.760 align:middle line:84%
And this beauty,
once we tap into,

00:51:50.760 --> 00:51:53.130 align:middle line:84%
and we realize that
it's better if we go

00:51:53.130 --> 00:51:54.630 align:middle line:90%
with the flow of the energy--

00:51:54.630 --> 00:51:59.760 align:middle line:84%
because always, when I'm
working on topic of anxiety,

00:51:59.760 --> 00:52:02.010 align:middle line:84%
the key question
to ask ourselves

00:52:02.010 --> 00:52:04.950 align:middle line:84%
is, what do we know that
we need to be creating?

00:52:04.950 --> 00:52:08.970 align:middle line:84%
Either you let it do a flyby
on, and you didn't actually

00:52:08.970 --> 00:52:10.020 align:middle line:90%
finish it.

00:52:10.020 --> 00:52:13.410 align:middle line:84%
And that is what needs
your time and attention.

00:52:13.410 --> 00:52:15.870 align:middle line:84%
And then also, the
anxieties are where you just

00:52:15.870 --> 00:52:18.540 align:middle line:84%
let all these other
emotions do the flyby.

00:52:18.540 --> 00:52:19.560 align:middle line:90%
And you didn't seize it.

00:52:19.560 --> 00:52:21.825 align:middle line:84%
You didn't get what it
was intended to teach you.

00:52:21.825 --> 00:52:22.950 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: You ignored them.

00:52:22.950 --> 00:52:23.120 align:middle line:90%
>>BARSOTTI: Exactly.

00:52:23.120 --> 00:52:24.340 align:middle line:90%
So it builds up.

00:52:24.340 --> 00:52:26.160 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: It does, yeah.

00:52:26.160 --> 00:52:29.790 align:middle line:84%
Out of all this, one of the
most stark instances of someone

00:52:29.790 --> 00:52:32.940 align:middle line:84%
who just thrived in COVID
was a friend of mine.

00:52:32.940 --> 00:52:35.400 align:middle line:84%
Now, she's the kind of
personality, very talented,

00:52:35.400 --> 00:52:38.340 align:middle line:84%
kind of wants to be part
of everything all the time.

00:52:38.340 --> 00:52:42.360 align:middle line:84%
Her agenda has to be full all
the time, never a slot open.

00:52:42.360 --> 00:52:45.270 align:middle line:84%
And now she's at
home by herself.

00:52:45.270 --> 00:52:48.630 align:middle line:84%
And she said, gosh,
I feel so good.

00:52:48.630 --> 00:52:53.730 align:middle line:84%
And she realized that she didn't
want to miss out on anything.

00:52:53.730 --> 00:52:56.850 align:middle line:84%
Like her life would be
less if she missed out

00:52:56.850 --> 00:53:01.090 align:middle line:84%
on everything and everyone
that was going on around her.

00:53:01.090 --> 00:53:03.310 align:middle line:84%
And when she realized,
I can't go anywhere,

00:53:03.310 --> 00:53:06.990 align:middle line:84%
there is nowhere to go, she
started settling into herself.

00:53:06.990 --> 00:53:09.120 align:middle line:90%
And she was more calm.

00:53:09.120 --> 00:53:12.420 align:middle line:84%
She was starting to get
back into her artwork.

00:53:12.420 --> 00:53:13.950 align:middle line:84%
And it was just
beautiful to watch.

00:53:13.950 --> 00:53:17.970 align:middle line:84%
She wasn't out there trying
to prove and please and feel

00:53:17.970 --> 00:53:21.150 align:middle line:84%
like she was wanted and part of
all of these different groups

00:53:21.150 --> 00:53:22.020 align:middle line:90%
and so forth.

00:53:22.020 --> 00:53:25.020 align:middle line:84%
And for her, COVID was really
a transformational experience.

00:53:25.020 --> 00:53:26.190 align:middle line:90%
>>BARSOTTI: I totally agree.

00:53:26.190 --> 00:53:28.350 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: It was
beautiful to see.

00:53:28.350 --> 00:53:31.260 align:middle line:84%
I don't have to be anywhere
with anyone at a certain time.

00:53:31.260 --> 00:53:32.410 align:middle line:90%
No one else is either.

00:53:32.410 --> 00:53:33.490 align:middle line:90%
I'm not missing out.

00:53:33.490 --> 00:53:36.810 align:middle line:84%
>>BARSOTTI: Yeah, and my add
to that is, which she also

00:53:36.810 --> 00:53:39.720 align:middle line:84%
may have tapped into is how
she was feeding on the energy

00:53:39.720 --> 00:53:41.790 align:middle line:84%
where everybody else
was in the midst of what

00:53:41.790 --> 00:53:43.320 align:middle line:90%
they were doing, as well.

00:53:43.320 --> 00:53:46.500 align:middle line:84%
And to get come back
in and hone, well,

00:53:46.500 --> 00:53:48.930 align:middle line:84%
what is it that wants
to be created within me,

00:53:48.930 --> 00:53:51.360 align:middle line:84%
not answering the
call always to what

00:53:51.360 --> 00:53:53.970 align:middle line:84%
is somebody else
needing from me.

00:53:53.970 --> 00:53:56.430 align:middle line:84%
And that's another thing
where empaths can fall in.

00:53:56.430 --> 00:53:59.970 align:middle line:84%
Because the empaths can
fall in and be rescuers.

00:53:59.970 --> 00:54:01.238 align:middle line:90%
And that is--

00:54:01.238 --> 00:54:03.280 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And even take
it on as their own fault.

00:54:03.280 --> 00:54:04.320 align:middle line:90%
>>BARSOTTI: Absolutely.

00:54:04.320 --> 00:54:08.460 align:middle line:84%
And so that energy that's
being summoned by somebody else

00:54:08.460 --> 00:54:12.162 align:middle line:84%
is summoning that out of
me as a call and response.

00:54:12.162 --> 00:54:13.620 align:middle line:84%
OK, that could be
a slippery slope.

00:54:13.620 --> 00:54:14.537 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes, it can.

00:54:14.537 --> 00:54:16.620 align:middle line:84%
>>BARSOTTI: And so
to look at, what's

00:54:16.620 --> 00:54:20.100 align:middle line:84%
the motivation for
entering into that dynamic,

00:54:20.100 --> 00:54:22.980 align:middle line:84%
if it's not coming from a
pure place, don't do it.

00:54:22.980 --> 00:54:24.420 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Exactly, I agree.

00:54:24.420 --> 00:54:26.067 align:middle line:84%
OK, I just had to
toss that out there.

00:54:26.067 --> 00:54:27.150 align:middle line:90%
We're running out of time.

00:54:27.150 --> 00:54:29.483 align:middle line:84%
And I just wanted to get to
the one final question here,

00:54:29.483 --> 00:54:31.463 align:middle line:90%
which is a big one.

00:54:31.463 --> 00:54:33.380 align:middle line:84%
And that is-- we've had
an idea, a perception,

00:54:33.380 --> 00:54:35.570 align:middle line:90%
of what the good life is.

00:54:35.570 --> 00:54:38.400 align:middle line:84%
And it's been fairly
steady throughout history.

00:54:38.400 --> 00:54:42.240 align:middle line:84%
Now all of that has
been blasted apart.

00:54:42.240 --> 00:54:44.760 align:middle line:84%
So what is your
perception of how

00:54:44.760 --> 00:54:49.290 align:middle line:84%
we have to re-establish in our
minds what the good life is,

00:54:49.290 --> 00:54:50.733 align:middle line:90%
to accommodate this?

00:54:50.733 --> 00:54:51.650 align:middle line:90%
>>BARSOTTI: Thank you.

00:54:51.650 --> 00:54:54.120 align:middle line:84%
What comes to mind when we
talk about the good life,

00:54:54.120 --> 00:54:59.220 align:middle line:84%
or like ads that come up
in the '50s, that have--

00:54:59.220 --> 00:55:00.900 align:middle line:84%
oh, you've got
washing machines now.

00:55:00.900 --> 00:55:02.610 align:middle line:90%
You've got all these machines.

00:55:02.610 --> 00:55:04.068 align:middle line:84%
And it's interesting,
because we're

00:55:04.068 --> 00:55:05.700 align:middle line:90%
in another kind of machine time.

00:55:05.700 --> 00:55:09.450 align:middle line:84%
But what's being required
is a little bit different.

00:55:09.450 --> 00:55:13.040 align:middle line:84%
And finding more
time for ourselves,

00:55:13.040 --> 00:55:16.830 align:middle line:84%
while we have more
of the age devices

00:55:16.830 --> 00:55:18.660 align:middle line:84%
that have come to
maturity-- like,

00:55:18.660 --> 00:55:20.460 align:middle line:84%
wow, we should
actually find ourselves

00:55:20.460 --> 00:55:21.870 align:middle line:90%
with time on our hands.

00:55:21.870 --> 00:55:25.110 align:middle line:84%
But we actually are finding
ourselves more geared into,

00:55:25.110 --> 00:55:27.720 align:middle line:84%
well, what information is
out there, and plugging

00:55:27.720 --> 00:55:29.100 align:middle line:90%
into a matrix.

00:55:29.100 --> 00:55:33.210 align:middle line:84%
And the good life
is, to me, choice.

00:55:33.210 --> 00:55:35.760 align:middle line:84%
It's realizing the
dominion and the domain

00:55:35.760 --> 00:55:39.690 align:middle line:84%
and the sovereignty
of our own choices,

00:55:39.690 --> 00:55:44.070 align:middle line:84%
and that we were being
sold something in what we

00:55:44.070 --> 00:55:45.300 align:middle line:90%
had as the good life.

00:55:45.300 --> 00:55:47.050 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Well, you
work a certain amount,

00:55:47.050 --> 00:55:47.850 align:middle line:90%
then you retire.

00:55:47.850 --> 00:55:49.470 align:middle line:84%
And then after you
retire, maybe you

00:55:49.470 --> 00:55:52.170 align:middle line:84%
go buy a condo somewhere
else, and whatever

00:55:52.170 --> 00:55:54.450 align:middle line:84%
that idea in the
material plane was.

00:55:54.450 --> 00:55:58.630 align:middle line:84%
And it was almost all associated
with the material plane.

00:55:58.630 --> 00:56:01.050 align:middle line:84%
Versus in some other
traditions in the East,

00:56:01.050 --> 00:56:02.550 align:middle line:84%
when you reach a
certain age, that's

00:56:02.550 --> 00:56:04.770 align:middle line:84%
your time of contemplation,
and the good life

00:56:04.770 --> 00:56:06.660 align:middle line:90%
is to untether from everything.

00:56:06.660 --> 00:56:08.327 align:middle line:84%
Not in the West,
we don't have that.

00:56:08.327 --> 00:56:09.160 align:middle line:90%
>>BARSOTTI: Not yet.

00:56:09.160 --> 00:56:10.020 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Maybe this
is our opportunity.

00:56:10.020 --> 00:56:12.480 align:middle line:84%
>>BARSOTTI: I think so, in that
we got a little taste of it

00:56:12.480 --> 00:56:13.470 align:middle line:90%
with the isolation.

00:56:13.470 --> 00:56:16.740 align:middle line:84%
And to the extent that we
can use it, and not let

00:56:16.740 --> 00:56:19.110 align:middle line:90%
industry hijack our minds.

00:56:19.110 --> 00:56:23.260 align:middle line:84%
Don't-- we can resist that,
and it's by our choice.

00:56:23.260 --> 00:56:25.290 align:middle line:84%
So I believe that,
in the age of grace,

00:56:25.290 --> 00:56:26.800 align:middle line:90%
it's about choosing first.

00:56:26.800 --> 00:56:27.600 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: I agree.

00:56:27.600 --> 00:56:30.630 align:middle line:90%
Final thoughts?

00:56:30.630 --> 00:56:32.070 align:middle line:84%
>>BARSOTTI: Let's
be disciplined.

00:56:32.070 --> 00:56:35.070 align:middle line:10%
Let's be disciplined
about our own truth.

00:56:35.070 --> 00:56:36.030 align:middle line:90%
What is our truth?

00:56:36.030 --> 00:56:37.020 align:middle line:90%
Feel it.

00:56:37.020 --> 00:56:38.130 align:middle line:90%
Come from love.

00:56:38.130 --> 00:56:39.690 align:middle line:10%
Be aware of what's
motivating you.

00:56:39.690 --> 00:56:42.920 align:middle line:10%
And if it's not coming from--
motivating us, not even you.

00:56:42.920 --> 00:56:44.700 align:middle line:90%
I mean, the collective you.

00:56:44.700 --> 00:56:50.250 align:middle line:84%
The universal I is greatly
affected by the individual I,

00:56:50.250 --> 00:56:52.620 align:middle line:84%
and that we are
responsible, ultimately,

00:56:52.620 --> 00:56:54.570 align:middle line:90%
for these choices that we make.

00:56:54.570 --> 00:56:57.310 align:middle line:84%
And they do have an effect
on the greater whole.

00:56:57.310 --> 00:56:59.130 align:middle line:90%
So we're in it together.

00:56:59.130 --> 00:57:05.630 align:middle line:84%
And that responsibility for self
and also the collective is--

00:57:05.630 --> 00:57:08.160 align:middle line:84%
we're in a gracious time to be
able to, I think, offer that.

00:57:08.160 --> 00:57:09.390 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Entering
the age of grace.

00:57:09.390 --> 00:57:10.770 align:middle line:84%
>>BARSOTTI: Yes,
we're getting there.

00:57:10.770 --> 00:57:11.370 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Hear, hear.

00:57:11.370 --> 00:57:11.790 align:middle line:90%
Beautiful.

00:57:11.790 --> 00:57:13.110 align:middle line:90%
Thank you so much, Tiffany.

00:57:13.110 --> 00:57:15.030 align:middle line:84%
I think this kind
of a conversation

00:57:15.030 --> 00:57:16.620 align:middle line:84%
is really warranted
at this time,

00:57:16.620 --> 00:57:19.830 align:middle line:84%
while we each try to struggle
looking for what's next.

00:57:19.830 --> 00:57:20.860 align:middle line:90%
So thank you so much.

00:57:20.860 --> 00:57:21.660 align:middle line:90%
>>BARSOTTI: Agreed.

00:57:21.660 --> 00:57:23.318 align:middle line:90%
Thank you so much, Regina.

this conversation,

00:57:25.110 --> 00:57:26.820 align:middle line:10%

Meanwhile, if you're
an empath and ready

00:57:31.020 --> 00:57:33.060 align:middle line:84%
to let go of the
stuff of others,

Until next time, thank
you for joining us here
