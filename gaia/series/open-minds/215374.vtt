00:00:19.040 --> 00:00:21.290 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA MEREDITH: Dr. Linda
Backman is back with us

00:00:21.290 --> 00:00:24.170 align:middle line:84%
to plunge deeper into the
concept of soul essence

00:00:24.170 --> 00:00:25.200 align:middle line:90%
psychology.

00:00:25.200 --> 00:00:26.840 align:middle line:84%
This means that we
examine our lives

00:00:26.840 --> 00:00:28.890 align:middle line:84%
through the lens
of our past lives,

00:00:28.890 --> 00:00:31.740 align:middle line:84%
our soul's origin, and
our life's purpose.

00:00:31.740 --> 00:00:33.890 align:middle line:84%
This also takes into
account the family

00:00:33.890 --> 00:00:37.820 align:middle line:84%
we choose to incarnate into and
all of those dynamics, which

00:00:37.820 --> 00:00:39.202 align:middle line:90%
is a very complex topic.

00:00:39.202 --> 00:00:40.410 align:middle line:90%
We're going to get into that.

00:00:40.410 --> 00:00:42.600 align:middle line:84%
So, first of all,
it's wonderful.

00:00:42.600 --> 00:00:44.160 align:middle line:84%
Wonderful to have
you back again.

00:00:44.160 --> 00:00:49.800 align:middle line:84%
And I love this topic of soul
incarnation, family incarnation,

00:00:49.800 --> 00:00:53.100 align:middle line:84%
dynamics, and how
these soul families,

00:00:53.100 --> 00:00:55.850 align:middle line:84%
our soul families choose
to come back together

00:00:55.850 --> 00:00:59.540 align:middle line:84%
to continue lessons
and torture each other

00:00:59.540 --> 00:01:01.780 align:middle line:90%
and enchant each other.

00:01:01.780 --> 00:01:04.280 align:middle line:84%
>> LINDA BACKMAN: Struggle
and love all at the same time.

00:01:04.280 --> 00:01:09.410 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And just to lay the
foundation for this, tell us--

00:01:09.410 --> 00:01:12.230 align:middle line:84%
I mean, people know you from
my past interviews with you.

00:01:12.230 --> 00:01:13.970 align:middle line:84%
So we won't go into
all the history.

00:01:13.970 --> 00:01:17.740 align:middle line:84%
But you've been doing
regression work, psychotherapist

00:01:17.740 --> 00:01:19.130 align:middle line:90%
for a very long time.

00:01:19.130 --> 00:01:25.660 align:middle line:84%
And so let's talk about why
you feel it's so important, so

00:01:25.660 --> 00:01:28.930 align:middle line:84%
valuable for a person to
have some understanding

00:01:28.930 --> 00:01:32.530 align:middle line:90%
of their past lives.

00:01:32.530 --> 00:01:35.020 align:middle line:84%
And is it necessary
for everyone?

00:01:35.020 --> 00:01:37.580 align:middle line:10%
>> LINDA: Well, that's
a great question.

00:01:37.580 --> 00:01:41.350 align:middle line:10%
And sometimes people will say to
me, well, Linda, my past lives

00:01:41.350 --> 00:01:44.510 align:middle line:10%
are past, so why do I need
to know about my past lives?

00:01:44.510 --> 00:01:48.610 align:middle line:10%
But the bottom line is our past
lives show up in current life,

00:01:48.610 --> 00:01:51.620 align:middle line:10%
and our past lives tell
us what kind of work--

00:01:51.620 --> 00:01:54.820 align:middle line:10%
not work, not paid
work, but what kind

00:01:54.820 --> 00:01:57.580 align:middle line:10%
of accomplishments
and learning has

00:01:57.580 --> 00:02:01.370 align:middle line:10%
been going on lifetime
to lifetime to lifetime?

00:02:01.370 --> 00:02:05.300 align:middle line:84%
It explains, well, why do
I feel drawn to this person

00:02:05.300 --> 00:02:06.680 align:middle line:90%
but I've never met them?

00:02:06.680 --> 00:02:08.240 align:middle line:90%
Why do I have this skill?

00:02:08.240 --> 00:02:09.680 align:middle line:90%
Where did it come from?

00:02:09.680 --> 00:02:11.720 align:middle line:90%
What have I accomplished before?

00:02:11.720 --> 00:02:14.540 align:middle line:84%
And so our past lives are
part of our current life.

00:02:14.540 --> 00:02:16.010 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah, absolutely.

00:02:16.010 --> 00:02:17.980 align:middle line:84%
So one of the things
I love is what

00:02:17.980 --> 00:02:20.650 align:middle line:84%
I talked about
early on, which is

00:02:20.650 --> 00:02:25.690 align:middle line:84%
the notion that a soul carefully
plans their incarnations.

00:02:25.690 --> 00:02:27.580 align:middle line:84%
And a lot of people
have a problem

00:02:27.580 --> 00:02:31.720 align:middle line:84%
with this concept, which is
I happen to agree with you.

00:02:31.720 --> 00:02:35.740 align:middle line:84%
My understanding is that we
definitely choose our families

00:02:35.740 --> 00:02:36.980 align:middle line:90%
before birth.

00:02:36.980 --> 00:02:39.880 align:middle line:84%
We're not just stuffed into
a body against our will

00:02:39.880 --> 00:02:43.490 align:middle line:84%
with a bunch of strangers, even
if we'd like to say we were,

00:02:43.490 --> 00:02:46.420 align:middle line:90%
even if it wasn't fun.

00:02:46.420 --> 00:02:48.920 align:middle line:84%
Let's talk about that
in a fuller sense.

00:02:48.920 --> 00:02:51.864 align:middle line:84%
>> LINDA: Well I
like to call this--

00:02:51.864 --> 00:02:54.260 align:middle line:84%
you referred to soul
essence psychology.

00:02:54.260 --> 00:02:56.590 align:middle line:84%
So soul essence
psychology means,

00:02:56.590 --> 00:02:58.400 align:middle line:90%
who am I at that core level?

00:02:58.400 --> 00:02:59.570 align:middle line:90%
Who have I been before?

00:02:59.570 --> 00:03:00.970 align:middle line:90%
Where do I come from?

00:03:00.970 --> 00:03:02.060 align:middle line:90%
Why am I here now?

00:03:02.060 --> 00:03:05.290 align:middle line:84%
So when we step
into our families,

00:03:05.290 --> 00:03:08.080 align:middle line:84%
that's not to say that every
family member is someone

00:03:08.080 --> 00:03:09.670 align:middle line:90%
we've had many lives with.

00:03:09.670 --> 00:03:15.910 align:middle line:84%
But almost always generally
those first-degree relatives are

00:03:15.910 --> 00:03:16.992 align:middle line:90%
souls we've--

00:03:16.992 --> 00:03:18.200 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Known before, yeah.

00:03:18.200 --> 00:03:19.617 align:middle line:84%
>> LINDA: That
we've known before.

00:03:19.617 --> 00:03:25.300 align:middle line:84%
And we're either cleaning
something up from the past.

00:03:25.300 --> 00:03:28.390 align:middle line:84%
One of the tricky parts
is that both souls have--

00:03:28.390 --> 00:03:30.970 align:middle line:84%
both people in body,
both souls in body

00:03:30.970 --> 00:03:33.110 align:middle line:84%
have to agree to
clean things up.

00:03:33.110 --> 00:03:37.490 align:middle line:84%
So sometimes we don't clean
things up in current life.

00:03:37.490 --> 00:03:42.322 align:middle line:84%
That's because both people
aren't ready to do that.

00:03:42.322 --> 00:03:45.940 align:middle line:84%
But yes, the
familiarity we have is,

00:03:45.940 --> 00:03:47.930 align:middle line:84%
oh, I mean, it
could be a mentor.

00:03:47.930 --> 00:03:49.640 align:middle line:84%
It could be your
next door neighbor.

00:03:49.640 --> 00:03:52.840 align:middle line:84%
It's like, why do I feel
drawn to this person?

00:03:52.840 --> 00:03:54.915 align:middle line:84%
It's usually because
you've known them before.

00:03:54.915 --> 00:03:57.960 align:middle line:90%


00:03:57.960 --> 00:04:00.600 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: I had a situation in
my life where someone very dear

00:04:00.600 --> 00:04:03.460 align:middle line:84%
passed and I was left
with the impression, God,

00:04:03.460 --> 00:04:06.240 align:middle line:84%
I wish I could have done
more for them before they

00:04:06.240 --> 00:04:07.090 align:middle line:90%
passed away.

00:04:07.090 --> 00:04:09.160 align:middle line:90%
I feel like I didn't.

00:04:09.160 --> 00:04:11.230 align:middle line:84%
And so I talked
with my own group--

00:04:11.230 --> 00:04:15.160 align:middle line:84%
my own soul group, and
they explained to me,

00:04:15.160 --> 00:04:18.540 align:middle line:84%
they said, you don't
understand this correctly.

00:04:18.540 --> 00:04:20.640 align:middle line:90%
You helped this soul before.

00:04:20.640 --> 00:04:24.360 align:middle line:84%
And this soul was here to help
you along in this lifetime

00:04:24.360 --> 00:04:27.330 align:middle line:84%
and wasn't able to accomplish
what they came to do.

00:04:27.330 --> 00:04:29.550 align:middle line:84%
And it was very
interesting because they

00:04:29.550 --> 00:04:33.550 align:middle line:84%
said the time for this
connection has now passed.

00:04:33.550 --> 00:04:36.090 align:middle line:90%
You will not be together again.

00:04:36.090 --> 00:04:39.480 align:middle line:84%
You can be thankful and
grateful and love this soul,

00:04:39.480 --> 00:04:44.070 align:middle line:84%
but the soul will go on and
continue learning this lesson

00:04:44.070 --> 00:04:46.465 align:middle line:84%
with someone else
who's in the space

00:04:46.465 --> 00:04:48.840 align:middle line:84%
to learn that lesson because
I guess I must have moved on

00:04:48.840 --> 00:04:49.960 align:middle line:90%
from that lesson.

00:04:49.960 --> 00:04:52.090 align:middle line:84%
And I thought that
was interesting,

00:04:52.090 --> 00:04:55.720 align:middle line:84%
because a character who
I've incarnated with plenty,

00:04:55.720 --> 00:04:59.510 align:middle line:84%
and they said, now
time's up on that one.

00:04:59.510 --> 00:05:00.950 align:middle line:84%
It was fascinating
because that's

00:05:00.950 --> 00:05:02.867 align:middle line:84%
the only time I've heard
that where you're not

00:05:02.867 --> 00:05:05.040 align:middle line:90%
going to see them again.

00:05:05.040 --> 00:05:07.640 align:middle line:90%
>> LINDA: I think there are--

00:05:07.640 --> 00:05:08.850 align:middle line:90%
how to say this.

00:05:08.850 --> 00:05:12.440 align:middle line:84%
It's like the spiritual realm
is much more complicated

00:05:12.440 --> 00:05:13.790 align:middle line:90%
than people think.

00:05:13.790 --> 00:05:17.550 align:middle line:84%
And so it's like, how
do plans get made?

00:05:17.550 --> 00:05:20.160 align:middle line:84%
How do plans, you
might say, get unmade?

00:05:20.160 --> 00:05:22.522 align:middle line:90%
Referring to what you just said.

00:05:22.522 --> 00:05:23.777 align:middle line:90%
And what's the point?

00:05:23.777 --> 00:05:25.610 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Because you
just said that earlier

00:05:25.610 --> 00:05:29.250 align:middle line:84%
that both souls have to show
up to learn the thing together.

00:05:29.250 --> 00:05:30.890 align:middle line:90%
That's why I brought it up.

00:05:30.890 --> 00:05:33.110 align:middle line:90%
Didn't happen that way.

00:05:33.110 --> 00:05:34.640 align:middle line:90%
>> LINDA: Exactly.

00:05:34.640 --> 00:05:38.070 align:middle line:84%
But yes, the spiritual
realm can decide,

00:05:38.070 --> 00:05:41.400 align:middle line:84%
well, OK, it didn't work
this way to clean this up.

00:05:41.400 --> 00:05:44.660 align:middle line:90%
So we'll create another way.

00:05:44.660 --> 00:05:47.360 align:middle line:84%
It's almost like,
to some extent,

00:05:47.360 --> 00:05:48.960 align:middle line:90%
it's a little bit experimenting.

00:05:48.960 --> 00:05:50.910 align:middle line:90%
It's like, this didn't work.

00:05:50.910 --> 00:05:52.533 align:middle line:90%
So let's try something else.

00:05:52.533 --> 00:05:54.200 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Just stuck
with the same souls

00:05:54.200 --> 00:05:58.180 align:middle line:84%
where you have any kind
of inequity in your desire

00:05:58.180 --> 00:06:00.748 align:middle line:84%
to learn, your ability to
take on challenge and change.

00:06:00.748 --> 00:06:03.040 align:middle line:84%
You're not still stuck with
it if you don't work it out

00:06:03.040 --> 00:06:04.540 align:middle line:90%
with that soul.

00:06:04.540 --> 00:06:06.260 align:middle line:90%
>> LINDA: Totally.

00:06:06.260 --> 00:06:10.390 align:middle line:84%
Here's a different version
of that or a different story.

00:06:10.390 --> 00:06:12.920 align:middle line:90%
This is about me personally.

00:06:12.920 --> 00:06:15.950 align:middle line:84%
I have a very dear, long
standing girlfriend.

00:06:15.950 --> 00:06:18.220 align:middle line:84%
I've known her since
I think I was 12.

00:06:18.220 --> 00:06:20.660 align:middle line:90%
And we're very different today.

00:06:20.660 --> 00:06:23.930 align:middle line:84%
Everybody that's listening
knows me and knows what I do.

00:06:23.930 --> 00:06:27.790 align:middle line:84%
She does not believe
in this type of work.

00:06:27.790 --> 00:06:32.180 align:middle line:84%
She's very tied to
her own Western--

00:06:32.180 --> 00:06:35.150 align:middle line:84%
you might say Western
religious beliefs,

00:06:35.150 --> 00:06:36.860 align:middle line:90%
which is completely fine.

00:06:36.860 --> 00:06:39.640 align:middle line:90%
I totally respect her for that.

00:06:39.640 --> 00:06:42.060 align:middle line:84%
In a way, we're walking
different paths and in a way

00:06:42.060 --> 00:06:42.860 align:middle line:90%
we're not.

00:06:42.860 --> 00:06:45.140 align:middle line:90%
We're still very good friends.

00:06:45.140 --> 00:06:48.200 align:middle line:84%
I don't know that we're
cleaning up a lot of things,

00:06:48.200 --> 00:06:52.480 align:middle line:84%
but what I'm speaking
to is where people--

00:06:52.480 --> 00:06:55.750 align:middle line:84%
where we accept, OK, I have
this perspective of life.

00:06:55.750 --> 00:06:57.460 align:middle line:84%
I have this spiritual
perspective.

00:06:57.460 --> 00:07:00.130 align:middle line:84%
Somebody else has a
different perspective.

00:07:00.130 --> 00:07:02.620 align:middle line:84%
Does that mean we
can't interact?

00:07:02.620 --> 00:07:05.650 align:middle line:84%
Does that mean it's not
purposeful to be connected?

00:07:05.650 --> 00:07:08.140 align:middle line:84%
My sense is no, it
doesn't mean that.

00:07:08.140 --> 00:07:11.400 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Oh, yeah, that's
what I find, because like you,

00:07:11.400 --> 00:07:14.400 align:middle line:84%
are there people who have
certainly judged my career path

00:07:14.400 --> 00:07:16.540 align:middle line:90%
over the last 25 years or so?

00:07:16.540 --> 00:07:19.500 align:middle line:84%
And most of the
people in my life

00:07:19.500 --> 00:07:22.110 align:middle line:84%
just didn't understand why
I would use my media career

00:07:22.110 --> 00:07:23.862 align:middle line:90%
and do that with it.

00:07:23.862 --> 00:07:25.660 align:middle line:90%
But these are people I love.

00:07:25.660 --> 00:07:29.640 align:middle line:84%
And so I just choose to
connect with them in the areas

00:07:29.640 --> 00:07:32.430 align:middle line:84%
where we actually
have connection.

00:07:32.430 --> 00:07:36.400 align:middle line:84%
So if it's about our children,
if it's about movies,

00:07:36.400 --> 00:07:39.070 align:middle line:84%
you can still connect and
you can still have love.

00:07:39.070 --> 00:07:40.740 align:middle line:84%
It doesn't mean you
have to be on-- this

00:07:40.740 --> 00:07:42.060 align:middle line:90%
is a big one right now.

00:07:42.060 --> 00:07:44.460 align:middle line:90%
This is huge in society.

00:07:44.460 --> 00:07:48.220 align:middle line:84%
You don't have to believe the
same to still love one another.

00:07:48.220 --> 00:07:51.450 align:middle line:84%
>> LINDA: And I think, I
mean, I love how we just segue

00:07:51.450 --> 00:07:53.600 align:middle line:90%
into different pieces of this.

00:07:53.600 --> 00:07:55.880 align:middle line:84%
Makes me think about
how many of my clients

00:07:55.880 --> 00:07:59.100 align:middle line:84%
come and they bring questions
to their regression.

00:07:59.100 --> 00:08:01.620 align:middle line:84%
And one of their questions,
especially if they're a mom,

00:08:01.620 --> 00:08:03.750 align:middle line:84%
they'll say, well, how
can I help my child?

00:08:03.750 --> 00:08:06.740 align:middle line:84%
How can I-- and the child
might be seven or the child

00:08:06.740 --> 00:08:08.190 align:middle line:90%
might be 47.

00:08:08.190 --> 00:08:09.290 align:middle line:90%
It doesn't really matter.

00:08:09.290 --> 00:08:11.190 align:middle line:90%
But, what can I do?

00:08:11.190 --> 00:08:14.060 align:middle line:84%
My child is struggling
with x, y, z.

00:08:14.060 --> 00:08:16.910 align:middle line:84%
And almost always the
guides of the client

00:08:16.910 --> 00:08:22.170 align:middle line:84%
will say your child's on their
journey, you're on your journey.

00:08:22.170 --> 00:08:25.580 align:middle line:84%
And the guides
often will say, let

00:08:25.580 --> 00:08:30.180 align:middle line:84%
your child make their choices,
love them, support them.

00:08:30.180 --> 00:08:34.289 align:middle line:84%
And it's so hard when
it's your own child,

00:08:34.289 --> 00:08:36.799 align:middle line:84%
but let them walk
their own journey.

00:08:36.799 --> 00:08:39.140 align:middle line:90%
But love them all the same.

00:08:39.140 --> 00:08:40.320 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Absolutely.

00:08:40.320 --> 00:08:41.789 align:middle line:90%
And I know that one well.

00:08:41.789 --> 00:08:45.950 align:middle line:84%
And so let's talk
about that for a moment

00:08:45.950 --> 00:08:49.280 align:middle line:84%
because there is a thing
that's been happening-- there

00:08:49.280 --> 00:08:50.510 align:middle line:90%
are articles written on it.

00:08:50.510 --> 00:08:54.880 align:middle line:84%
And they label it more of a
millennial generation thing,

00:08:54.880 --> 00:08:57.240 align:middle line:84%
but it's probably
in the Zs as well.

00:08:57.240 --> 00:08:58.480 align:middle line:90%
Gen Z, the Zoomers.

00:08:58.480 --> 00:09:02.500 align:middle line:84%
And that is a rejection
of parents and family,

00:09:02.500 --> 00:09:05.160 align:middle line:84%
which is becoming
fairly prominent.

00:09:05.160 --> 00:09:06.930 align:middle line:84%
I'm shocked at the
number of people

00:09:06.930 --> 00:09:10.140 align:middle line:84%
I run across whose
kids have said,

00:09:10.140 --> 00:09:14.830 align:middle line:84%
I don't accept the way you do
something or you talk to me

00:09:14.830 --> 00:09:18.130 align:middle line:84%
and I want to sever ties with
you because you stress me out.

00:09:18.130 --> 00:09:21.630 align:middle line:84%
And what is going
on there to have

00:09:21.630 --> 00:09:27.450 align:middle line:84%
so much more a mass movement
towards severing ties

00:09:27.450 --> 00:09:29.350 align:middle line:90%
with family or parents?

00:09:29.350 --> 00:09:32.880 align:middle line:84%
Have you seen any of
this in your regressions?

00:09:32.880 --> 00:09:34.710 align:middle line:90%
>> LINDA: I mean, I don't see--

00:09:34.710 --> 00:09:36.960 align:middle line:84%
I certainly know what you're
talking about in terms

00:09:36.960 --> 00:09:38.708 align:middle line:90%
of severing ties.

00:09:38.708 --> 00:09:39.750 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: So many people.

00:09:39.750 --> 00:09:41.483 align:middle line:90%
And that never used to happen.

00:09:41.483 --> 00:09:43.150 align:middle line:84%
You might not like
your parents, per se.

00:09:43.150 --> 00:09:44.770 align:middle line:90%
You might find them whatever.

00:09:44.770 --> 00:09:46.330 align:middle line:90%
But you didn't sever ties.

00:09:46.330 --> 00:09:47.950 align:middle line:90%
They were your parents.

00:09:47.950 --> 00:09:49.240 align:middle line:90%
>> LINDA: Well, yes.

00:09:49.240 --> 00:09:50.690 align:middle line:90%
But I think it's almost--

00:09:50.690 --> 00:09:52.830 align:middle line:90%
some of that's generational.

00:09:52.830 --> 00:09:56.030 align:middle line:84%
Obviously, one or
two generations ago,

00:09:56.030 --> 00:09:57.600 align:middle line:90%
who ever heard of divorce?

00:09:57.600 --> 00:09:58.740 align:middle line:90%
It just didn't happen.

00:09:58.740 --> 00:10:01.450 align:middle line:90%
People just stayed together.

00:10:01.450 --> 00:10:02.700 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Except in my family.

00:10:02.700 --> 00:10:04.347 align:middle line:90%
My grandfather did it a lot.

00:10:04.347 --> 00:10:05.430 align:middle line:90%
>> LINDA: Oh, interesting.

00:10:05.430 --> 00:10:06.260 align:middle line:90%
Interesting.

00:10:06.260 --> 00:10:07.990 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:10:07.990 --> 00:10:13.650 align:middle line:84%
I think there's more pressure on
what I call experienced souls.

00:10:13.650 --> 00:10:15.540 align:middle line:84%
And so, what do I mean
by experienced souls?

00:10:15.540 --> 00:10:18.470 align:middle line:84%
I simply mean someone whose
level of soul evolution

00:10:18.470 --> 00:10:19.950 align:middle line:90%
is beyond mid-range.

00:10:19.950 --> 00:10:24.560 align:middle line:84%
I think there's more pressure
from the higher realm.

00:10:24.560 --> 00:10:29.070 align:middle line:84%
The needs of humanity are
so much greater currently,

00:10:29.070 --> 00:10:31.430 align:middle line:84%
and there's so many issues
that people are struggling

00:10:31.430 --> 00:10:36.600 align:middle line:84%
with that guides, put more
pressure on their guidees,

00:10:36.600 --> 00:10:39.300 align:middle line:84%
you might say, to
grow and evolve.

00:10:39.300 --> 00:10:44.180 align:middle line:84%
So sometimes that person
needs to pull away

00:10:44.180 --> 00:10:49.360 align:middle line:84%
in order to step onto maybe
a slightly different path.

00:10:49.360 --> 00:10:53.320 align:middle line:84%
And I think it happens a lot
where the child then comes back

00:10:53.320 --> 00:10:57.315 align:middle line:84%
around and reconnects
back with their family.

00:10:57.315 --> 00:10:59.950 align:middle line:90%


00:10:59.950 --> 00:11:02.320 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: I just find it
fascinating because it's almost

00:11:02.320 --> 00:11:04.280 align:middle line:84%
like you're not
meeting my preferences,

00:11:04.280 --> 00:11:06.590 align:middle line:84%
so I don't want
anything to do with you.

00:11:06.590 --> 00:11:08.860 align:middle line:84%
That's what it looks like
at the most gross face

00:11:08.860 --> 00:11:11.510 align:middle line:90%
value, which seems like, whoa.

00:11:11.510 --> 00:11:13.580 align:middle line:84%
On the other hand, you
just mentioned something,

00:11:13.580 --> 00:11:16.810 align:middle line:84%
and that is that a lot of the
newer generations of souls

00:11:16.810 --> 00:11:18.850 align:middle line:90%
have higher sensitivity levels.

00:11:18.850 --> 00:11:21.050 align:middle line:90%
So yeah, we're siloed.

00:11:21.050 --> 00:11:22.520 align:middle line:84%
Yeah, we all have
our preferences.

00:11:22.520 --> 00:11:25.640 align:middle line:84%
And people like to be
treated like they're special.

00:11:25.640 --> 00:11:26.630 align:middle line:90%
That's true.

00:11:26.630 --> 00:11:31.060 align:middle line:84%
But genuinely, the younger souls
are having this high sensitivity

00:11:31.060 --> 00:11:33.430 align:middle line:84%
where they seem to not
be able to tolerate

00:11:33.430 --> 00:11:35.980 align:middle line:84%
or handle things that
seem too harsh to them

00:11:35.980 --> 00:11:37.690 align:middle line:90%
on an emotional level.

00:11:37.690 --> 00:11:38.590 align:middle line:90%
>> LINDA: Yes.

00:11:38.590 --> 00:11:40.900 align:middle line:84%
And what I know
from my own work is

00:11:40.900 --> 00:11:44.710 align:middle line:84%
that there are more souls
coming to the planet that

00:11:44.710 --> 00:11:50.070 align:middle line:84%
don't have a lot of background
in incarnation on this planet.

00:11:50.070 --> 00:11:51.810 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So no
emotional resilience.

00:11:51.810 --> 00:11:53.410 align:middle line:90%
This is a very emotional planet.

00:11:53.410 --> 00:11:54.368 align:middle line:90%
>> LINDA: That's right.

00:11:54.368 --> 00:11:57.180 align:middle line:84%
And they're not
used to being here.

00:11:57.180 --> 00:12:01.590 align:middle line:84%
And so it's almost like moving
from you've lived in the United

00:12:01.590 --> 00:12:07.080 align:middle line:84%
States for 55 years and
suddenly you move to China

00:12:07.080 --> 00:12:10.300 align:middle line:84%
or wherever you move
to, to try to adapt.

00:12:10.300 --> 00:12:14.640 align:middle line:84%
And so I think the
adaptation is harder.

00:12:14.640 --> 00:12:19.980 align:middle line:84%
So I know from client
regression work

00:12:19.980 --> 00:12:26.280 align:middle line:84%
that the higher realm keeps
working to create ways

00:12:26.280 --> 00:12:28.470 align:middle line:90%
to advance humanity.

00:12:28.470 --> 00:12:33.160 align:middle line:84%
And sometimes the ways aren't
so smooth and easy for people.

00:12:33.160 --> 00:12:34.898 align:middle line:90%
But there's--

00:12:34.898 --> 00:12:36.690 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: No, we didn't
choose to incarnate

00:12:36.690 --> 00:12:38.710 align:middle line:90%
into smooth and easy times.

00:12:38.710 --> 00:12:41.550 align:middle line:84%
We chose to incarnate
into transformative times.

00:12:41.550 --> 00:12:45.150 align:middle line:84%
So going back to this notion of
family, because it's coming up

00:12:45.150 --> 00:12:47.150 align:middle line:84%
so much and so many
families are even

00:12:47.150 --> 00:12:52.280 align:middle line:84%
divided now philosophically,
politically, psychologically.

00:12:52.280 --> 00:12:54.210 align:middle line:84%
This is the time of
the great division.

00:12:54.210 --> 00:12:57.920 align:middle line:84%
And so, can you give us
an example of any clients

00:12:57.920 --> 00:13:00.590 align:middle line:84%
you may have worked with
on a family level that

00:13:00.590 --> 00:13:02.060 align:middle line:84%
are trying to
bridge this and what

00:13:02.060 --> 00:13:03.990 align:middle line:84%
they found through
past life regression

00:13:03.990 --> 00:13:05.690 align:middle line:84%
even, because these
times are not--

00:13:05.690 --> 00:13:08.250 align:middle line:84%
it's not the first time the
planet has been divided.

00:13:08.250 --> 00:13:12.440 align:middle line:84%
>> LINDA: Well, I think that all
goes back to what I like to call

00:13:12.440 --> 00:13:13.680 align:middle line:90%
soul design.

00:13:13.680 --> 00:13:17.870 align:middle line:84%
So it's like soul design
means understanding yourself

00:13:17.870 --> 00:13:22.290 align:middle line:84%
not just from this life,
but from past lives.

00:13:22.290 --> 00:13:26.870 align:middle line:84%
And so soul design
means if I know what's

00:13:26.870 --> 00:13:29.780 align:middle line:90%
happened to me in the past--

00:13:29.780 --> 00:13:32.630 align:middle line:84%
and perhaps if I know
what's happened to my sister

00:13:32.630 --> 00:13:36.740 align:middle line:84%
or my child or my
neighbor, it helps

00:13:36.740 --> 00:13:41.690 align:middle line:84%
me to understand them and not
be judgmental of their choices

00:13:41.690 --> 00:13:44.120 align:middle line:90%
and their actions.

00:13:44.120 --> 00:13:48.790 align:middle line:90%
It helps me to get them.

00:13:48.790 --> 00:13:52.220 align:middle line:84%
I recently had an experience,
even in my own personal life

00:13:52.220 --> 00:13:56.810 align:middle line:84%
of understanding a
new responsibility.

00:13:56.810 --> 00:13:58.490 align:middle line:90%
So this brings in higher self.

00:13:58.490 --> 00:14:02.570 align:middle line:84%
So this brings in,
what is our soul doing?

00:14:02.570 --> 00:14:05.660 align:middle line:84%
What is our higher self
doing when we're in body?

00:14:05.660 --> 00:14:10.150 align:middle line:84%
And I recently was a
little bit uncomfortable,

00:14:10.150 --> 00:14:11.650 align:middle line:84%
I'll put it that
way, with something

00:14:11.650 --> 00:14:14.330 align:middle line:90%
that our son said to me.

00:14:14.330 --> 00:14:17.210 align:middle line:84%
Our son is obviously
very much an adult.

00:14:17.210 --> 00:14:20.900 align:middle line:84%
And it's like I was a
little bit miffed by it.

00:14:20.900 --> 00:14:25.330 align:middle line:84%
And so I did some of my own
intuitive work to tap into,

00:14:25.330 --> 00:14:27.910 align:middle line:84%
what's going on with
his higher self?

00:14:27.910 --> 00:14:31.120 align:middle line:84%
And his higher self, what
I got through my guides

00:14:31.120 --> 00:14:34.540 align:middle line:84%
is his higher self has taken
on a new responsibility

00:14:34.540 --> 00:14:36.190 align:middle line:90%
on the planet.

00:14:36.190 --> 00:14:40.000 align:middle line:84%
So our higher
selves agree to what

00:14:40.000 --> 00:14:42.020 align:middle line:84%
we're going to be doing
in our current life.

00:14:42.020 --> 00:14:45.530 align:middle line:84%
And its higher self had
taken on a responsibility

00:14:45.530 --> 00:14:51.270 align:middle line:84%
to try to assist an issue
going on with humans.

00:14:51.270 --> 00:14:56.060 align:middle line:84%
And it was like, oh,
that explains why he--

00:14:56.060 --> 00:14:58.940 align:middle line:84%
I thought, overreacted
to something

00:14:58.940 --> 00:15:04.260 align:middle line:84%
I said because it ties to his
agreements at the soul level.

00:15:04.260 --> 00:15:09.960 align:middle line:84%
And it helped me relax
about my response to him.

00:15:09.960 --> 00:15:14.210 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So it allows you to
stay in deep rapport with them

00:15:14.210 --> 00:15:18.800 align:middle line:84%
in peace by having done
your own excavation of that.

00:15:18.800 --> 00:15:20.095 align:middle line:90%
Did you share that with him?

00:15:20.095 --> 00:15:22.610 align:middle line:90%


00:15:22.610 --> 00:15:24.840 align:middle line:84%
>> LINDA: Not yet,
because it's new.

00:15:24.840 --> 00:15:27.180 align:middle line:84%
I just gained that
perspective, actually,

00:15:27.180 --> 00:15:30.110 align:middle line:84%
very, very recently in
the last week or so.

00:15:30.110 --> 00:15:33.465 align:middle line:84%
And I know him well
enough to know--

00:15:33.465 --> 00:15:35.340 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: You'll know
when the time is right.

00:15:35.340 --> 00:15:35.620 align:middle line:90%
>> LINDA: Right.

00:15:35.620 --> 00:15:37.170 align:middle line:90%
And I have to be careful.

00:15:37.170 --> 00:15:38.930 align:middle line:90%
He has certain boundaries.

00:15:38.930 --> 00:15:42.350 align:middle line:84%
I need to respect
those boundaries.

00:15:42.350 --> 00:15:46.470 align:middle line:84%
But it certainly helped me
let go of being frustrated.

00:15:46.470 --> 00:15:47.300 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Good.

00:15:47.300 --> 00:15:48.270 align:middle line:90%
Excellent.

00:15:48.270 --> 00:15:52.140 align:middle line:84%
So let's talk a little bit
about the regression process.

00:15:52.140 --> 00:15:55.100 align:middle line:84%
And years ago, I had a
little hypnotherapy gig

00:15:55.100 --> 00:15:56.900 align:middle line:90%
and I did past life regressions.

00:15:56.900 --> 00:15:58.290 align:middle line:90%
I did it because it was fun.

00:15:58.290 --> 00:15:59.100 align:middle line:90%
I loved doing it.

00:15:59.100 --> 00:16:00.183 align:middle line:90%
And it was-- I don't know.

00:16:00.183 --> 00:16:02.240 align:middle line:84%
It was just a skill set
that came easily for me.

00:16:02.240 --> 00:16:05.790 align:middle line:84%
So I started noticing
certain patterns and such.

00:16:05.790 --> 00:16:09.560 align:middle line:84%
And one of the things that
people come in with is they're

00:16:09.560 --> 00:16:11.480 align:middle line:84%
afraid that they're
going to make a mistake

00:16:11.480 --> 00:16:14.570 align:middle line:84%
and not be right, that they're
going to say something that's

00:16:14.570 --> 00:16:16.830 align:middle line:90%
not true and so forth.

00:16:16.830 --> 00:16:18.780 align:middle line:90%
So I had my own way.

00:16:18.780 --> 00:16:21.140 align:middle line:84%
And let's talk about
how you let a person

00:16:21.140 --> 00:16:24.960 align:middle line:84%
know: relax, it can
be metaphorical.

00:16:24.960 --> 00:16:26.700 align:middle line:90%
You don't have to be perfect.

00:16:26.700 --> 00:16:30.120 align:middle line:84%
Talk about this, how we set
ourselves up for regression.

00:16:30.120 --> 00:16:33.460 align:middle line:84%
So we don't feel like we're
coming in with anxiety

00:16:33.460 --> 00:16:34.760 align:middle line:90%
like we're going to fail.

00:16:34.760 --> 00:16:38.300 align:middle line:84%
>> LINDA: And meaning that we
don't have as much performance

00:16:38.300 --> 00:16:40.802 align:middle line:90%
anxiety about the regression.

00:16:40.802 --> 00:16:42.510 align:middle line:84%
I've been doing this
for years and years.

00:16:42.510 --> 00:16:46.330 align:middle line:84%
And I just say you don't get
a good grade or a bad grade

00:16:46.330 --> 00:16:47.660 align:middle line:90%
when you do a regression.

00:16:47.660 --> 00:16:49.250 align:middle line:90%
You don't get it right or wrong.

00:16:49.250 --> 00:16:52.150 align:middle line:90%
This is not a performance.

00:16:52.150 --> 00:16:54.360 align:middle line:90%
Because clients are nervous.

00:16:54.360 --> 00:16:55.160 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: They are.

00:16:55.160 --> 00:16:56.330 align:middle line:90%
Yeah, they're very nervous.

00:16:56.330 --> 00:16:56.530 align:middle line:90%
>> LINDA: Yeah.

00:16:56.530 --> 00:16:57.830 align:middle line:90%
And part of the nervousness--

00:16:57.830 --> 00:16:58.660 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: I think they're
going to find something

00:16:58.660 --> 00:16:59.960 align:middle line:90%
bad inside themselves.

00:16:59.960 --> 00:17:00.990 align:middle line:90%
>> LINDA: That's true.

00:17:00.990 --> 00:17:03.246 align:middle line:90%
That's totally true.

00:17:03.246 --> 00:17:05.710 align:middle line:84%
But we live in a
culture of maybe

00:17:05.710 --> 00:17:08.380 align:middle line:84%
they're going to find something
bad, so they worry about that.

00:17:08.380 --> 00:17:13.049 align:middle line:84%
Maybe they need to please me
with how well or not well they

00:17:13.049 --> 00:17:13.849 align:middle line:90%
do.

00:17:13.849 --> 00:17:16.300 align:middle line:84%
So I just have this
automatic thing

00:17:16.300 --> 00:17:19.180 align:middle line:84%
I say is they're getting
ready to lie down

00:17:19.180 --> 00:17:21.050 align:middle line:84%
and so they can
relax their bodies.

00:17:21.050 --> 00:17:26.020 align:middle line:84%
And I just say things
like you don't pass

00:17:26.020 --> 00:17:28.099 align:middle line:90%
or fail in doing a regression.

00:17:28.099 --> 00:17:31.930 align:middle line:84%
It comes forward the way
it needs to come forward.

00:17:31.930 --> 00:17:35.140 align:middle line:84%
The other thing is they
often misunderstand

00:17:35.140 --> 00:17:36.620 align:middle line:90%
the anxiety they feel.

00:17:36.620 --> 00:17:39.880 align:middle line:84%
So oftentimes, clients
will say I'll meet them

00:17:39.880 --> 00:17:42.690 align:middle line:84%
and I'll be doing the interview
and I'll say, how are you doing?

00:17:42.690 --> 00:17:45.840 align:middle line:84%
And I'll say, well, I'm excited,
but I'm kind of nervous.

00:17:45.840 --> 00:17:50.810 align:middle line:84%
And so I say to them,
nervousness is normal

00:17:50.810 --> 00:17:53.490 align:middle line:84%
and you may be
feeling the energy.

00:17:53.490 --> 00:17:59.130 align:middle line:84%
What you perceive as nervousness
may well be the energy building.

00:17:59.130 --> 00:18:03.020 align:middle line:84%
Your guides are ready to be
benevolent and bring forward

00:18:03.020 --> 00:18:04.500 align:middle line:90%
useful information.

00:18:04.500 --> 00:18:07.650 align:middle line:84%
Not malevolent, but
benevolent information.

00:18:07.650 --> 00:18:09.980 align:middle line:84%
And you feel the energy
building and you're

00:18:09.980 --> 00:18:11.630 align:middle line:90%
interpreting that as anxiety.

00:18:11.630 --> 00:18:13.830 align:middle line:90%
That is extremely common.

00:18:13.830 --> 00:18:17.240 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And also not knowing--
even if they're already

00:18:17.240 --> 00:18:19.640 align:middle line:84%
spiritually well
developed, not knowing

00:18:19.640 --> 00:18:22.580 align:middle line:84%
what kind of new
responsibility might be

00:18:22.580 --> 00:18:25.050 align:middle line:90%
arriving through that session.

00:18:25.050 --> 00:18:27.690 align:middle line:84%
What kind of changes
might be necessary.

00:18:27.690 --> 00:18:29.172 align:middle line:90%
Just the unexpected.

00:18:29.172 --> 00:18:31.130 align:middle line:84%
Not knowing what's going
to be required of them

00:18:31.130 --> 00:18:32.255 align:middle line:90%
after they know this stuff.

00:18:32.255 --> 00:18:33.055 align:middle line:90%
>> LINDA: Sure.

00:18:33.055 --> 00:18:34.700 align:middle line:84%
And I think that
it's normal for us

00:18:34.700 --> 00:18:38.060 align:middle line:84%
as humans to worry
about the unexpected.

00:18:38.060 --> 00:18:39.510 align:middle line:84%
There are a lot
of people, though,

00:18:39.510 --> 00:18:41.820 align:middle line:84%
that think that if
they're going to uncover--

00:18:41.820 --> 00:18:43.423 align:middle line:84%
I've had so many
people say to me,

00:18:43.423 --> 00:18:44.840 align:middle line:84%
well, Linda, I
don't want to learn

00:18:44.840 --> 00:18:46.350 align:middle line:90%
that I was a mass murderer.

00:18:46.350 --> 00:18:49.520 align:middle line:84%
And what I say to them,
completely honest response

00:18:49.520 --> 00:18:54.020 align:middle line:84%
from me is I've honestly never
regressed a mass murderer in 20

00:18:54.020 --> 00:18:54.840 align:middle line:90%
some odd years.

00:18:54.840 --> 00:18:58.110 align:middle line:84%
So they're not going to learn
they're a mass murderer.

00:18:58.110 --> 00:19:00.690 align:middle line:84%
But they're worried
that there's trauma.

00:19:00.690 --> 00:19:02.490 align:middle line:90%
They understand karma.

00:19:02.490 --> 00:19:06.410 align:middle line:84%
I mean, we've all made
unhealthy choices in past lives

00:19:06.410 --> 00:19:09.240 align:middle line:84%
because the human
times are brutal,

00:19:09.240 --> 00:19:11.840 align:middle line:90%
we've definitely unhealthy.

00:19:11.840 --> 00:19:16.280 align:middle line:84%
So I help them understand, what
might anxiety mean because we

00:19:16.280 --> 00:19:18.492 align:middle line:90%
often misinterpret it?

00:19:18.492 --> 00:19:20.390 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And also
to open Pandoras Box

00:19:20.390 --> 00:19:22.880 align:middle line:84%
and be confronted,
perhaps with some of that,

00:19:22.880 --> 00:19:24.425 align:middle line:90%
that is still trying to heal.

00:19:24.425 --> 00:19:25.225 align:middle line:90%
>> LINDA: Right.

00:19:25.225 --> 00:19:26.940 align:middle line:90%
And we're all trying to heal.

00:19:26.940 --> 00:19:29.702 align:middle line:84%
I mean, that's in many ways,
that's why we came into body.

00:19:29.702 --> 00:19:31.160 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: But don't
you notice that

00:19:31.160 --> 00:19:33.980 align:middle line:84%
with people, most of the
time, that's not really what

00:19:33.980 --> 00:19:35.220 align:middle line:90%
people are confronted with.

00:19:35.220 --> 00:19:37.378 align:middle line:84%
The guides and their
higher self really

00:19:37.378 --> 00:19:39.170 align:middle line:84%
want to show them what's
critical for right

00:19:39.170 --> 00:19:42.470 align:middle line:84%
now to advance, not
to hold you back

00:19:42.470 --> 00:19:45.470 align:middle line:84%
into the slop of
the emotional past.

00:19:45.470 --> 00:19:48.660 align:middle line:10%
>> LINDA: I mean,
their guides, clearly,

00:19:48.660 --> 00:19:50.130 align:middle line:10%
from what you're
saying, is true.

00:19:50.130 --> 00:19:53.810 align:middle line:10%
Guides aren't trying to make
you miserable by helping

00:19:53.810 --> 00:19:56.510 align:middle line:10%
you understand something
that happened in a past life.

00:19:56.510 --> 00:19:59.390 align:middle line:90%
But plus, the reason--

00:19:59.390 --> 00:20:02.720 align:middle line:84%
I think one of the core
of the core reasons

00:20:02.720 --> 00:20:08.360 align:middle line:84%
why I do regression is for
people to understand, who am I?

00:20:08.360 --> 00:20:09.870 align:middle line:90%
Where do I come from?

00:20:09.870 --> 00:20:11.130 align:middle line:90%
Why am I here?

00:20:11.130 --> 00:20:12.750 align:middle line:90%
What am I working on?

00:20:12.750 --> 00:20:15.680 align:middle line:90%
What are my skills?

00:20:15.680 --> 00:20:17.580 align:middle line:90%
Am I pushing myself too hard?

00:20:17.580 --> 00:20:21.830 align:middle line:84%
Sometimes guides will say you
need to take more time just

00:20:21.830 --> 00:20:27.260 align:middle line:84%
to go do what you want to do and
not pressure yourself so much.

00:20:27.260 --> 00:20:31.080 align:middle line:84%
And so it's all about learning,
who are we at the core level?

00:20:31.080 --> 00:20:34.520 align:middle line:84%
Not just who are
we in life today?

00:20:34.520 --> 00:20:38.740 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And speaking of
today, so let's maybe if you can

00:20:38.740 --> 00:20:41.120 align:middle line:84%
reflect back on a client
or share a story with us,

00:20:41.120 --> 00:20:42.940 align:middle line:90%
yours or someone else's.

00:20:42.940 --> 00:20:46.370 align:middle line:84%
Often what happens in past
life regression, of course,

00:20:46.370 --> 00:20:49.910 align:middle line:84%
is they're not necessarily going
to bring you a linear past life.

00:20:49.910 --> 00:20:51.910 align:middle line:84%
They're going to
bring a past life that

00:20:51.910 --> 00:20:54.400 align:middle line:84%
is directly reflective
of what you're working

00:20:54.400 --> 00:20:56.570 align:middle line:90%
on enhancing or learning now.

00:20:56.570 --> 00:20:59.470 align:middle line:84%
And that could have been
thousands of years ago.

00:20:59.470 --> 00:21:04.780 align:middle line:84%
Oh, so please talk about that
and share a regression or two

00:21:04.780 --> 00:21:06.680 align:middle line:84%
about this, because
people are confused.

00:21:06.680 --> 00:21:08.630 align:middle line:84%
They think it's their
immediate last life.

00:21:08.630 --> 00:21:10.160 align:middle line:90%
No, that's not how it works.

00:21:10.160 --> 00:21:11.090 align:middle line:90%
It's non-linear.

00:21:11.090 --> 00:21:12.560 align:middle line:90%
>> LINDA: Well, two things.

00:21:12.560 --> 00:21:15.760 align:middle line:84%
It's almost never your
most recent past life.

00:21:15.760 --> 00:21:21.260 align:middle line:84%
And just so listeners know
this, lives can overlap in time.

00:21:21.260 --> 00:21:25.370 align:middle line:84%
So that kind of sets up
a bit of a confusion.

00:21:25.370 --> 00:21:30.020 align:middle line:84%
But yeah, I mean, I love
our organic conversation.

00:21:30.020 --> 00:21:34.210 align:middle line:90%
I'm flashing on a recent client.

00:21:34.210 --> 00:21:37.480 align:middle line:84%
I can't tell you how long
ago this was, but when I tell

00:21:37.480 --> 00:21:38.740 align:middle line:90%
the details, it'll be obvious.

00:21:38.740 --> 00:21:39.880 align:middle line:90%
It was a long time ago.

00:21:39.880 --> 00:21:43.680 align:middle line:84%
This woman, one of the reasons
for coming for the regression is

00:21:43.680 --> 00:21:46.980 align:middle line:84%
she said, I'm very
spiritual, but I've always

00:21:46.980 --> 00:21:47.910 align:middle line:90%
been afraid of dying.

00:21:47.910 --> 00:21:50.140 align:middle line:90%
And I just can't seem to shake.

00:21:50.140 --> 00:21:51.730 align:middle line:90%
I know we continue.

00:21:51.730 --> 00:21:53.940 align:middle line:90%
I know our soul is immortal.

00:21:53.940 --> 00:21:56.720 align:middle line:90%
But I have such a fear of dying.

00:21:56.720 --> 00:21:59.710 align:middle line:84%
And I think listeners know
when I'm guiding regression,

00:21:59.710 --> 00:22:03.810 align:middle line:84%
I have no idea before the
regression where it's going.

00:22:03.810 --> 00:22:08.420 align:middle line:84%
She went into-- it's fascinating
for me and hopefully fascinating

00:22:08.420 --> 00:22:09.220 align:middle line:90%
for the client.

00:22:09.220 --> 00:22:13.680 align:middle line:84%
She went into a time
of living in a cave.

00:22:13.680 --> 00:22:15.220 align:middle line:90%
She was a leper.

00:22:15.220 --> 00:22:16.600 align:middle line:90%
She had leprosy.

00:22:16.600 --> 00:22:20.700 align:middle line:84%
So I'm sure we're talking
thousands of years ago.

00:22:20.700 --> 00:22:26.610 align:middle line:84%
She was a leper in a cave with
a man who was also had leprosy.

00:22:26.610 --> 00:22:30.340 align:middle line:84%
They weren't romantically
connected with each other.

00:22:30.340 --> 00:22:33.060 align:middle line:84%
They were living in
this cave because they

00:22:33.060 --> 00:22:36.740 align:middle line:84%
were protecting other
people from their disease.

00:22:36.740 --> 00:22:39.180 align:middle line:84%
Fortunately, she was not
in the cave by herself,

00:22:39.180 --> 00:22:41.210 align:middle line:84%
but she learned
how she died, which

00:22:41.210 --> 00:22:44.780 align:middle line:84%
was the release valve,
almost like the release

00:22:44.780 --> 00:22:46.410 align:middle line:90%
valve on a pressure cooker.

00:22:46.410 --> 00:22:51.870 align:middle line:84%
So she discovered that there was
a major storm or a major flood

00:22:51.870 --> 00:22:56.510 align:middle line:84%
or something, and
the cave flooded.

00:22:56.510 --> 00:22:58.770 align:middle line:84%
And this may sound
awful to listeners.

00:22:58.770 --> 00:23:01.350 align:middle line:84%
It was a complete
release for her.

00:23:01.350 --> 00:23:06.030 align:middle line:84%
The cave flooded and she died
because the cave flooded.

00:23:06.030 --> 00:23:09.390 align:middle line:90%
That was the fear of dying.

00:23:09.390 --> 00:23:13.340 align:middle line:84%
She reported to me after
days and a few weeks

00:23:13.340 --> 00:23:16.400 align:middle line:84%
after the regression
that she had released

00:23:16.400 --> 00:23:19.880 align:middle line:84%
her fear of dying because
she understood what happened

00:23:19.880 --> 00:23:21.120 align:middle line:90%
thousands of years ago.

00:23:21.120 --> 00:23:23.390 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Did she also
have a fear of water?

00:23:23.390 --> 00:23:24.196 align:middle line:90%
>> LINDA: Yeah.

00:23:24.196 --> 00:23:26.654 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: A lot of people have
a fear of water when they've

00:23:26.654 --> 00:23:27.960 align:middle line:90%
drowned a number of times.

00:23:27.960 --> 00:23:28.760 align:middle line:90%
>> LINDA: Exactly.

00:23:28.760 --> 00:23:31.040 align:middle line:84%
I think it was a
fear, basically,

00:23:31.040 --> 00:23:36.820 align:middle line:84%
of dying because water
and mud filled the cave.

00:23:36.820 --> 00:23:40.940 align:middle line:84%
And so people might go, oh,
dear, that's really awful.

00:23:40.940 --> 00:23:44.030 align:middle line:84%
What I teach people how
to guide regression.

00:23:44.030 --> 00:23:48.310 align:middle line:84%
And what I say is you've got
to be supportive and stay

00:23:48.310 --> 00:23:54.370 align:middle line:84%
with the client, because the
ultimate release will almost

00:23:54.370 --> 00:23:57.730 align:middle line:90%
always alleviate the fear.

00:23:57.730 --> 00:23:58.850 align:middle line:90%
And it did.

00:23:58.850 --> 00:24:02.270 align:middle line:84%
But it was fascinating that
she could see she was a leper.

00:24:02.270 --> 00:24:03.730 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Wow, that's wonderful.

00:24:03.730 --> 00:24:08.290 align:middle line:84%
When you're talking, one thing
that's striking me is I've

00:24:08.290 --> 00:24:10.850 align:middle line:90%
always had this feeling.

00:24:10.850 --> 00:24:13.640 align:middle line:84%
And I guess, I don't know
if it's a fear or not

00:24:13.640 --> 00:24:19.540 align:middle line:84%
a fear, maybe, of dying
at a certain time of day.

00:24:19.540 --> 00:24:22.990 align:middle line:84%
And it happens to
be the time of day

00:24:22.990 --> 00:24:28.340 align:middle line:84%
I was born in this lifetime
with the sun at that angle.

00:24:28.340 --> 00:24:32.320 align:middle line:84%
And then many years
later, I learned that

00:24:32.320 --> 00:24:34.560 align:middle line:84%
through the
Rosicrucian teachings

00:24:34.560 --> 00:24:37.410 align:middle line:84%
that they believe that
your time of birth

00:24:37.410 --> 00:24:42.180 align:middle line:84%
coincides with the time of
death in your last incarnation.

00:24:42.180 --> 00:24:44.178 align:middle line:84%
And I thought,
that's interesting.

00:24:44.178 --> 00:24:45.720 align:middle line:84%
I wonder what was
going on, because I

00:24:45.720 --> 00:24:50.400 align:middle line:84%
remember thinking I would
rather die earlier in the day

00:24:50.400 --> 00:24:51.330 align:middle line:90%
than then.

00:24:51.330 --> 00:24:54.010 align:middle line:84%
And Always I've carried that
feeling with me my whole life.

00:24:54.010 --> 00:24:55.870 align:middle line:84%
So when I see the light
at that time of day,

00:24:55.870 --> 00:24:58.120 align:middle line:84%
it's like, yeah, I
don't like that light.

00:24:58.120 --> 00:25:00.750 align:middle line:84%
So something must
have happened in the--

00:25:00.750 --> 00:25:01.953 align:middle line:90%
and I never looked into it.

00:25:01.953 --> 00:25:04.120 align:middle line:84%
I've never regressed myself
or been regressed on it.

00:25:04.120 --> 00:25:06.680 align:middle line:90%
But I find that interesting.

00:25:06.680 --> 00:25:09.607 align:middle line:84%
>> LINDA: I've never heard
that Rosicrucian belief.

00:25:09.607 --> 00:25:11.940 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: That's somewhere
in the Hermetic teachings was

00:25:11.940 --> 00:25:13.350 align:middle line:90%
talking about that, I thought.

00:25:13.350 --> 00:25:15.250 align:middle line:84%
It was a Rosicrucian
book, actually.

00:25:15.250 --> 00:25:17.310 align:middle line:84%
I thought that's
interesting that we

00:25:17.310 --> 00:25:20.140 align:middle line:84%
would pick up on the
frequency we left off at.

00:25:20.140 --> 00:25:22.720 align:middle line:84%
If that's true, I only
read it in one book.

00:25:22.720 --> 00:25:25.710 align:middle line:84%
So it's hearsay
until we find out

00:25:25.710 --> 00:25:28.810 align:middle line:84%
on a mass scale people are
experiencing this, I suppose.

00:25:28.810 --> 00:25:33.070 align:middle line:84%
>> LINDA: But that would be
fascinating to theoretically

00:25:33.070 --> 00:25:39.700 align:middle line:84%
guide you in a regression, not
necessarily to see at what time

00:25:39.700 --> 00:25:42.160 align:middle line:90%
of day that might come forward.

00:25:42.160 --> 00:25:44.530 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: 4:44.

00:25:44.530 --> 00:25:45.705 align:middle line:90%
>> LINDA: So it's 4:44.

00:25:45.705 --> 00:25:47.080 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: In the
afternoon, yeah.

00:25:47.080 --> 00:25:47.880 align:middle line:90%
>> LINDA: Yeah.

00:25:47.880 --> 00:25:49.750 align:middle line:84%
So there's probably
some numerology,

00:25:49.750 --> 00:25:50.990 align:middle line:90%
I'm sure you know this.

00:25:50.990 --> 00:25:54.830 align:middle line:84%
There's some kind of
numerology relationship.

00:25:54.830 --> 00:25:57.775 align:middle line:84%
I'm sure you know
numbers have meaning.

00:25:57.775 --> 00:25:59.420 align:middle line:90%
And so that's the case.

00:25:59.420 --> 00:26:06.700 align:middle line:84%
But to ask, that's the beauty
of discovering and asking

00:26:06.700 --> 00:26:08.320 align:middle line:84%
questions in the
longer regression

00:26:08.320 --> 00:26:10.700 align:middle line:84%
that I guide, which is
also soul level regression,

00:26:10.700 --> 00:26:13.340 align:middle line:84%
is for what reason
do I have this worry?

00:26:13.340 --> 00:26:18.320 align:middle line:84%
For what reason do I look at the
sun at 4:44 and wonder what that

00:26:18.320 --> 00:26:19.120 align:middle line:90%
means?

00:26:19.120 --> 00:26:21.740 align:middle line:90%
I know for me, I have many--

00:26:21.740 --> 00:26:23.590 align:middle line:84%
I have far more
than one past life

00:26:23.590 --> 00:26:26.450 align:middle line:84%
where I died young
from an illness.

00:26:26.450 --> 00:26:30.400 align:middle line:84%
And young, meaning younger
in my adult years than I

00:26:30.400 --> 00:26:31.820 align:middle line:90%
would have expected to die.

00:26:31.820 --> 00:26:42.600 align:middle line:84%
And I died from a deteriorating
illness, that worry lives in me.

00:26:42.600 --> 00:26:44.050 align:middle line:90%
So it's not fully gone.

00:26:44.050 --> 00:26:46.440 align:middle line:84%
But because I know
about it, it helps

00:26:46.440 --> 00:26:51.910 align:middle line:84%
me to not let physical
things overly concern me.

00:26:51.910 --> 00:26:54.360 align:middle line:90%
So I think a lot of us have.

00:26:54.360 --> 00:26:55.240 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:26:55.240 --> 00:26:57.690 align:middle line:84%
And as you're
speaking about that,

00:26:57.690 --> 00:27:00.360 align:middle line:84%
I'm feeling like
what bothers me about

00:27:00.360 --> 00:27:02.140 align:middle line:84%
that, I think I live
to be quite old,

00:27:02.140 --> 00:27:04.210 align:middle line:84%
which I may again
in this lifetime.

00:27:04.210 --> 00:27:08.730 align:middle line:84%
And I think I was alone
when the sun was setting.

00:27:08.730 --> 00:27:12.810 align:middle line:84%
And it's something about
the kind of a coldness

00:27:12.810 --> 00:27:19.650 align:middle line:84%
and a loneliness of those last
hours of awareness as the sun is

00:27:19.650 --> 00:27:22.450 align:middle line:90%
setting, something about that.

00:27:22.450 --> 00:27:25.200 align:middle line:84%
>> LINDA: So my sense is,
and this is the beauty

00:27:25.200 --> 00:27:28.020 align:middle line:84%
of our conversation right
now, is that my sense is

00:27:28.020 --> 00:27:30.300 align:middle line:84%
you're tapping into
valid information.

00:27:30.300 --> 00:27:32.403 align:middle line:90%
That's how it feels to me.

00:27:32.403 --> 00:27:34.070 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Yeah, because
that's one thing

00:27:34.070 --> 00:27:35.760 align:middle line:90%
about living to be really old.

00:27:35.760 --> 00:27:37.830 align:middle line:84%
We also want to
have a long life.

00:27:37.830 --> 00:27:39.680 align:middle line:84%
But a lot of times,
those last years

00:27:39.680 --> 00:27:41.130 align:middle line:90%
are very lonely for people.

00:27:41.130 --> 00:27:43.380 align:middle line:84%
I'm so glad my dad
lived into his 90s.

00:27:43.380 --> 00:27:45.230 align:middle line:84%
I'm so glad we could
be there for him

00:27:45.230 --> 00:27:47.180 align:middle line:90%
right up to the very end.

00:27:47.180 --> 00:27:51.810 align:middle line:84%
To be surrounded with love
is such a wonderful luxury,

00:27:51.810 --> 00:27:54.620 align:middle line:90%
if you can have that.

00:27:54.620 --> 00:27:57.860 align:middle line:84%
>> LINDA: So that brings
forward another quick story.

00:27:57.860 --> 00:27:58.710 align:middle line:90%
Quick story.

00:27:58.710 --> 00:28:02.510 align:middle line:84%
My mother died at 93
about 10 years ago.

00:28:02.510 --> 00:28:04.730 align:middle line:90%
My mother and I did not have--

00:28:04.730 --> 00:28:07.320 align:middle line:84%
I mean, we had a relationship
throughout my whole life,

00:28:07.320 --> 00:28:09.720 align:middle line:84%
but my mother was not
an easy personality.

00:28:09.720 --> 00:28:12.000 align:middle line:84%
And lots of people
agreed with that.

00:28:12.000 --> 00:28:14.910 align:middle line:84%
But as she was getting older
and once she was a widow,

00:28:14.910 --> 00:28:18.560 align:middle line:84%
after my father passed,
I had this compulsion

00:28:18.560 --> 00:28:23.450 align:middle line:84%
that I didn't understand to
make sure she was cared for.

00:28:23.450 --> 00:28:26.300 align:middle line:84%
And I was going to be
the one versus my sibling

00:28:26.300 --> 00:28:28.080 align:middle line:90%
to make sure mom was cared for.

00:28:28.080 --> 00:28:33.560 align:middle line:84%
So that happened, and we had
her in a very wonderful facility

00:28:33.560 --> 00:28:36.040 align:middle line:84%
and I visited her
at least once a week

00:28:36.040 --> 00:28:41.020 align:middle line:84%
and made sure her needs were
met, et cetera, Et cetera.

00:28:41.020 --> 00:28:45.220 align:middle line:84%
In that course of that period
of time, seven or eight years,

00:28:45.220 --> 00:28:48.310 align:middle line:84%
we finally said I love
you to each other.

00:28:48.310 --> 00:28:52.100 align:middle line:84%
She didn't expect me to want
to take care of her, and I did.

00:28:52.100 --> 00:28:54.340 align:middle line:84%
But in the course of
the seven or eight years

00:28:54.340 --> 00:28:58.060 align:middle line:84%
that she lived in this
very wonderful facility

00:28:58.060 --> 00:29:02.320 align:middle line:84%
not too far from where I live,
I discovered a past life.

00:29:02.320 --> 00:29:04.910 align:middle line:84%
And I discovered a
past life of mine

00:29:04.910 --> 00:29:08.180 align:middle line:84%
where, to make the
long story short,

00:29:08.180 --> 00:29:13.210 align:middle line:84%
I was married to a man that
had political aspirations.

00:29:13.210 --> 00:29:14.960 align:middle line:90%
This life was in India.

00:29:14.960 --> 00:29:17.420 align:middle line:84%
I was married to a man that
had political aspirations.

00:29:17.420 --> 00:29:18.680 align:middle line:90%
I deeply loved this man.

00:29:18.680 --> 00:29:22.060 align:middle line:90%
He was much older than I was.

00:29:22.060 --> 00:29:23.440 align:middle line:90%
So we married.

00:29:23.440 --> 00:29:25.490 align:middle line:84%
My family didn't
want me to marry him.

00:29:25.490 --> 00:29:27.560 align:middle line:90%
I was Zoroastrian.

00:29:27.560 --> 00:29:33.250 align:middle line:84%
I was of the Persian
faith and he was Muslim.

00:29:33.250 --> 00:29:37.510 align:middle line:84%
And in order to marry him,
I had to convert to Islam.

00:29:37.510 --> 00:29:38.920 align:middle line:90%
And my family did not like that.

00:29:38.920 --> 00:29:41.200 align:middle line:84%
But anyway, I was
deeply in love with him.

00:29:41.200 --> 00:29:42.480 align:middle line:90%
We had a daughter.

00:29:42.480 --> 00:29:45.990 align:middle line:84%
And soon after the
daughter was born,

00:29:45.990 --> 00:29:51.100 align:middle line:84%
he basically left the marriage
for his political desires.

00:29:51.100 --> 00:29:56.110 align:middle line:84%
I was so bereft over this
that when our daughter was 10,

00:29:56.110 --> 00:29:58.630 align:middle line:84%
I willed myself to
die from an illness.

00:29:58.630 --> 00:30:01.360 align:middle line:90%
But I willed myself to die.

00:30:01.360 --> 00:30:06.430 align:middle line:84%
The soul of the daughter is the
soul of my current life mother.

00:30:06.430 --> 00:30:10.800 align:middle line:84%
So it explained why I needed
to clean up the karma.

00:30:10.800 --> 00:30:13.080 align:middle line:84%
She'd already been
abandoned by her father.

00:30:13.080 --> 00:30:17.170 align:middle line:84%
So I abandoned her by
dying when she was 10.

00:30:17.170 --> 00:30:22.870 align:middle line:84%
And it helped me understand the
compulsion to take care of mom,

00:30:22.870 --> 00:30:25.163 align:middle line:90%
which I'm so glad I did.

00:30:25.163 --> 00:30:26.580 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: To just
get to the point

00:30:26.580 --> 00:30:28.250 align:middle line:84%
where you could say I
love you to each other.

00:30:28.250 --> 00:30:30.792 align:middle line:84%
>> LINDA: Well, I was with her
when she took her last breath.

00:30:30.792 --> 00:30:32.260 align:middle line:90%
It's exactly what I wanted.

00:30:32.260 --> 00:30:34.090 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: That's wonderful.

00:30:34.090 --> 00:30:38.920 align:middle line:84%
So in a cell maturation level,
as families go through this

00:30:38.920 --> 00:30:40.880 align:middle line:90%
and mature together, we do.

00:30:40.880 --> 00:30:44.350 align:middle line:84%
We do have a time where we
start splitting off a bit,

00:30:44.350 --> 00:30:48.040 align:middle line:84%
where I talked about
early on, and we

00:30:48.040 --> 00:30:51.160 align:middle line:84%
start taking on new
members of our soul tribe

00:30:51.160 --> 00:30:53.750 align:middle line:84%
to be able to engage us
into these new lessons.

00:30:53.750 --> 00:30:55.600 align:middle line:84%
So in our other
conversations, we've

00:30:55.600 --> 00:30:57.730 align:middle line:84%
talked about the three
main groups that are here--

00:30:57.730 --> 00:31:00.410 align:middle line:84%
Earth-based souls, IP
interplanetary souls,

00:31:00.410 --> 00:31:01.670 align:middle line:90%
and angelic type souls.

00:31:01.670 --> 00:31:04.840 align:middle line:84%
So let's talk about
what that looks

00:31:04.840 --> 00:31:07.390 align:middle line:84%
like with Earth-based
souls, which

00:31:07.390 --> 00:31:09.400 align:middle line:90%
are the majority of people.

00:31:09.400 --> 00:31:11.980 align:middle line:84%
How those family
dynamics, what you

00:31:11.980 --> 00:31:14.560 align:middle line:84%
see in terms of the
transformation and growth

00:31:14.560 --> 00:31:18.980 align:middle line:84%
and the need to move beyond
that particular soul family

00:31:18.980 --> 00:31:20.590 align:middle line:84%
perchance, or at
least some of them

00:31:20.590 --> 00:31:23.120 align:middle line:84%
compared to some of
the IP souls coming in.

00:31:23.120 --> 00:31:24.200 align:middle line:90%
That's a whole different.

00:31:24.200 --> 00:31:25.000 align:middle line:90%
>> LINDA: Yeah.

00:31:25.000 --> 00:31:27.520 align:middle line:84%
And soul families are different,
which we can talk about.

00:31:27.520 --> 00:31:30.750 align:middle line:84%
So families are different for
interplanetary and angelic

00:31:30.750 --> 00:31:31.823 align:middle line:90%
souls.

00:31:31.823 --> 00:31:34.240 align:middle line:84%
Let's talk about Earth-based
first and then the other two.

00:31:34.240 --> 00:31:37.900 align:middle line:84%
So Earth-based souls,
when our soul is new,

00:31:37.900 --> 00:31:42.600 align:middle line:84%
we are a member of what I call
soul pod of a good friend that

00:31:42.600 --> 00:31:45.190 align:middle line:84%
calls it a soul posse,
which is an interesting way.

00:31:45.190 --> 00:31:46.800 align:middle line:90%
So a soul pod.

00:31:46.800 --> 00:31:51.160 align:middle line:84%
An Earth-based soul pod
is about 12 to 20 souls,

00:31:51.160 --> 00:31:56.010 align:middle line:84%
and we have more lives with
those souls in that soul

00:31:56.010 --> 00:31:58.720 align:middle line:90%
pod than any other souls.

00:31:58.720 --> 00:32:02.235 align:middle line:84%
And then secondarily,
we have the next,

00:32:02.235 --> 00:32:03.610 align:middle line:84%
this is always
hard to verbalize,

00:32:03.610 --> 00:32:05.650 align:middle line:90%
we have the next most--

00:32:05.650 --> 00:32:10.390 align:middle line:84%
the next greatest number of
lives with adjacent soul pods.

00:32:10.390 --> 00:32:12.820 align:middle line:90%
Our soul pod never changes.

00:32:12.820 --> 00:32:16.720 align:middle line:84%
It is what it is,
but it can be unique.

00:32:16.720 --> 00:32:20.280 align:middle line:84%
Like for example, it just so
happens that my husband and I

00:32:20.280 --> 00:32:21.520 align:middle line:90%
are in the same soul pod.

00:32:21.520 --> 00:32:24.150 align:middle line:84%
That doesn't happen
for all people--

00:32:24.150 --> 00:32:26.880 align:middle line:84%
of romantically
connected people.

00:32:26.880 --> 00:32:29.670 align:middle line:84%
One of his grandparents
is in the pod

00:32:29.670 --> 00:32:32.710 align:middle line:84%
and one of my grandparents
is in the pod.

00:32:32.710 --> 00:32:37.470 align:middle line:84%
So in other words, it isn't
just, oh, it's my mother

00:32:37.470 --> 00:32:40.870 align:middle line:84%
and my mother's mother
and my grandfather.

00:32:40.870 --> 00:32:46.780 align:middle line:84%
It can be someone else's
loved ones, if you will.

00:32:46.780 --> 00:32:49.800 align:middle line:84%
And of course, those
people in that soul pod

00:32:49.800 --> 00:32:51.900 align:middle line:84%
don't always incarnate
in every life.

00:32:51.900 --> 00:32:54.840 align:middle line:90%
So they're not all with us now.

00:32:54.840 --> 00:32:58.290 align:middle line:84%
And they also may be people
that are not our family

00:32:58.290 --> 00:33:00.840 align:middle line:90%
members in current life.

00:33:00.840 --> 00:33:02.747 align:middle line:90%
But the soul pod doesn't change.

00:33:02.747 --> 00:33:03.580 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: All right.

00:33:03.580 --> 00:33:06.220 align:middle line:84%
So you have your set people
and then your adjacent,

00:33:06.220 --> 00:33:07.620 align:middle line:84%
which is kind of
compatible where

00:33:07.620 --> 00:33:09.940 align:middle line:84%
they come in and
out in incarnations,

00:33:09.940 --> 00:33:11.940 align:middle line:90%
your adjacent soul pod?

00:33:11.940 --> 00:33:16.530 align:middle line:84%
>> LINDA: The adjacent, quick
example would be I have two

00:33:16.530 --> 00:33:17.470 align:middle line:90%
children.

00:33:17.470 --> 00:33:20.530 align:middle line:84%
Our oldest child is
in the pod I'm in.

00:33:20.530 --> 00:33:22.930 align:middle line:84%
Our younger child is
in an adjacent pod.

00:33:22.930 --> 00:33:25.390 align:middle line:84%
It just means that with
our younger child that's

00:33:25.390 --> 00:33:28.990 align:middle line:84%
our daughter, I haven't had
quite as many lives with her

00:33:28.990 --> 00:33:30.290 align:middle line:90%
as our son.

00:33:30.290 --> 00:33:32.450 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: OK, let's
get to the eyepiece,

00:33:32.450 --> 00:33:35.180 align:middle line:90%
the interplanetary soul pods.

00:33:35.180 --> 00:33:36.640 align:middle line:90%
How does that even work?

00:33:36.640 --> 00:33:41.420 align:middle line:84%
These souls have come in
from around the cosmos.

00:33:41.420 --> 00:33:42.220 align:middle line:90%
>> LINDA: Yes.

00:33:42.220 --> 00:33:45.770 align:middle line:84%
So interplanetary
soul pods are small.

00:33:45.770 --> 00:33:49.520 align:middle line:84%
They're usually
three to five souls.

00:33:49.520 --> 00:33:53.080 align:middle line:84%
And those souls usually
come from one location

00:33:53.080 --> 00:33:54.680 align:middle line:90%
in the universe.

00:33:54.680 --> 00:33:57.110 align:middle line:90%
So now what people ask me a lot.

00:33:57.110 --> 00:33:58.220 align:middle line:90%
So I guide a regression.

00:33:58.220 --> 00:34:00.250 align:middle line:84%
The client learns
they're interplanetary.

00:34:00.250 --> 00:34:04.327 align:middle line:84%
And they know or we figure
out through the regression,

00:34:04.327 --> 00:34:06.410 align:middle line:84%
let's just say the oldest
child is their daughter,

00:34:06.410 --> 00:34:07.940 align:middle line:90%
and the daughter is Earth-based.

00:34:07.940 --> 00:34:10.760 align:middle line:84%
So the client-- this
is a common question.

00:34:10.760 --> 00:34:15.080 align:middle line:84%
The client asks me, so
does that mean my daughter,

00:34:15.080 --> 00:34:18.639 align:middle line:84%
Earth-based daughter
is in my soul pod?

00:34:18.639 --> 00:34:21.380 align:middle line:90%
I explain, no, they are not.

00:34:21.380 --> 00:34:24.580 align:middle line:84%
So sometimes that
bothers people.

00:34:24.580 --> 00:34:27.010 align:middle line:84%
And so just so the
listeners understand this.

00:34:27.010 --> 00:34:30.030 align:middle line:84%
But the bottom line is
an interplanetary soul

00:34:30.030 --> 00:34:33.960 align:middle line:84%
can have an Earth-based
family member

00:34:33.960 --> 00:34:37.290 align:middle line:84%
or loved one that they've
had multiple lives with.

00:34:37.290 --> 00:34:39.489 align:middle line:90%
There's still a soul connection.

00:34:39.489 --> 00:34:42.370 align:middle line:84%
It's just not that
they're in the same pod.

00:34:42.370 --> 00:34:46.050 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Why are the pods so
small with the interplanetaries?

00:34:46.050 --> 00:34:49.440 align:middle line:84%
>> LINDA: Partly because
interplanetary souls can come

00:34:49.440 --> 00:34:52.239 align:middle line:84%
from so many places
in the universe,

00:34:52.239 --> 00:35:00.600 align:middle line:84%
that often there are not many
souls from their home location

00:35:00.600 --> 00:35:02.310 align:middle line:90%
with whom they incarnate.

00:35:02.310 --> 00:35:05.010 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And who they have
those basic vibrational

00:35:05.010 --> 00:35:06.460 align:middle line:90%
frequencies that match with.

00:35:06.460 --> 00:35:07.260 align:middle line:90%
>> LINDA: Exactly.

00:35:07.260 --> 00:35:10.000 align:middle line:84%
And they don't know
them in current life,

00:35:10.000 --> 00:35:12.570 align:middle line:84%
perhaps, because
sometimes I work

00:35:12.570 --> 00:35:15.510 align:middle line:84%
with an interplanetary
client who

00:35:15.510 --> 00:35:21.100 align:middle line:84%
is the only soul from their home
location that comes to Earth.

00:35:21.100 --> 00:35:21.900 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:35:21.900 --> 00:35:22.992 align:middle line:90%
I hear you.

00:35:22.992 --> 00:35:27.540 align:middle line:84%
And for them, oftentimes, it's
a little lonelier existence?

00:35:27.540 --> 00:35:29.490 align:middle line:90%
>> LINDA: I would say yes.

00:35:29.490 --> 00:35:32.150 align:middle line:84%
Truthfully, I think
interplanetary souls

00:35:32.150 --> 00:35:35.750 align:middle line:84%
and angelic souls, maybe a
bit more interplanetary souls

00:35:35.750 --> 00:35:38.210 align:middle line:84%
struggle a bit more
with loneliness

00:35:38.210 --> 00:35:40.575 align:middle line:90%
than Earth-based souls do.

00:35:40.575 --> 00:35:42.450 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Now, let's go
to the angelic souls.

00:35:42.450 --> 00:35:43.250 align:middle line:90%
>> LINDA: Yeah.

00:35:43.250 --> 00:35:46.170 align:middle line:84%
Angelic souls-- all three
types of souls are fascinating.

00:35:46.170 --> 00:35:52.010 align:middle line:84%
But angelic souls are, I
find, incredibly fascinating.

00:35:52.010 --> 00:35:54.950 align:middle line:84%
I have a new book that will
have a lot more angelic soul

00:35:54.950 --> 00:35:57.440 align:middle line:90%
information in it from clients.

00:35:57.440 --> 00:36:01.680 align:middle line:84%
Angelic souls are some
of the most loving,

00:36:01.680 --> 00:36:05.910 align:middle line:84%
nurturing, caring because they
come from the angelic realm.

00:36:05.910 --> 00:36:08.540 align:middle line:90%
So angelic souls serve source.

00:36:08.540 --> 00:36:10.440 align:middle line:90%
They carry source energy.

00:36:10.440 --> 00:36:15.560 align:middle line:84%
So their signature vibration,
their signature orientation

00:36:15.560 --> 00:36:21.180 align:middle line:84%
is some of the purest caring
that I often ever see in people.

00:36:21.180 --> 00:36:28.020 align:middle line:84%
It's amazing how they are so
accepting of so many people that

00:36:28.020 --> 00:36:29.850 align:middle line:90%
are around them.

00:36:29.850 --> 00:36:32.500 align:middle line:84%
There are more angelic
souls coming to the planet.

00:36:32.500 --> 00:36:35.470 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Well, I was going
to be my next question.

00:36:35.470 --> 00:36:37.810 align:middle line:84%
So that hallmark is
they're very caring.

00:36:37.810 --> 00:36:40.350 align:middle line:90%
What about their soul pods?

00:36:40.350 --> 00:36:42.130 align:middle line:84%
>> LINDA: The soul
pods are small,

00:36:42.130 --> 00:36:44.590 align:middle line:90%
just like interplanetary souls.

00:36:44.590 --> 00:36:46.960 align:middle line:90%
Again, it could be two souls.

00:36:46.960 --> 00:36:48.113 align:middle line:90%
It could be five souls.

00:36:48.113 --> 00:36:50.730 align:middle line:90%


00:36:50.730 --> 00:36:54.630 align:middle line:84%
Angelic souls work within
the quandary of souls

00:36:54.630 --> 00:36:56.110 align:middle line:90%
that are angelic souls.

00:36:56.110 --> 00:37:00.570 align:middle line:84%
And they're headed
by the archangels.

00:37:00.570 --> 00:37:03.190 align:middle line:84%
But they don't-- it's not
like they don't have karma.

00:37:03.190 --> 00:37:05.580 align:middle line:90%
They can gather karma.

00:37:05.580 --> 00:37:09.450 align:middle line:84%
But typically they
are so accepting

00:37:09.450 --> 00:37:11.760 align:middle line:84%
that they don't
have quite as much

00:37:11.760 --> 00:37:15.330 align:middle line:90%
to work on in a human lifetime.

00:37:15.330 --> 00:37:16.690 align:middle line:90%
They're highly unique.

00:37:16.690 --> 00:37:19.600 align:middle line:84%
But we need their
energy on this planet.

00:37:19.600 --> 00:37:23.420 align:middle line:84%
We need more acceptance
of each other

00:37:23.420 --> 00:37:27.320 align:middle line:84%
and people's behavior and
people's differences and all

00:37:27.320 --> 00:37:28.225 align:middle line:90%
of that.

00:37:28.225 --> 00:37:30.350 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Yeah, and that's
one thing you're finding

00:37:30.350 --> 00:37:33.260 align:middle line:84%
in your work, is this going
toward this larger acceptance

00:37:33.260 --> 00:37:38.150 align:middle line:84%
and moving into what floats
all of us instead of the--

00:37:38.150 --> 00:37:40.620 align:middle line:84%
and everybody I interview,
it's the same thing.

00:37:40.620 --> 00:37:45.250 align:middle line:84%
We have to move away from
competition, exclusiveness, et

00:37:45.250 --> 00:37:46.220 align:middle line:90%
cetera.

00:37:46.220 --> 00:37:50.460 align:middle line:84%
We can't isolate ourselves as
beings, as a country, as souls.

00:37:50.460 --> 00:37:51.750 align:middle line:90%
We can't do that any longer.

00:37:51.750 --> 00:37:55.580 align:middle line:84%
So with the souls
that you're seeing,

00:37:55.580 --> 00:38:00.270 align:middle line:84%
you're seeing an increase in
angelic souls incarnating now.

00:38:00.270 --> 00:38:03.260 align:middle line:90%
What about IP souls?

00:38:03.260 --> 00:38:04.970 align:middle line:90%
>> LINDA: Yes.

00:38:04.970 --> 00:38:10.296 align:middle line:84%
Even though Earth is about
90% Earth-based souls,

00:38:10.296 --> 00:38:13.940 align:middle line:84%
but more angelics
and more IP souls

00:38:13.940 --> 00:38:16.710 align:middle line:84%
are being prepared
also to come to Earth.

00:38:16.710 --> 00:38:17.790 align:middle line:90%
So what does that mean?

00:38:17.790 --> 00:38:23.380 align:middle line:84%
That means IPs and angelic
souls have difficulty at times

00:38:23.380 --> 00:38:24.380 align:middle line:90%
being here.

00:38:24.380 --> 00:38:26.480 align:middle line:90%
It's an unfamiliar environment.

00:38:26.480 --> 00:38:31.220 align:middle line:84%
It's an unfamiliar physical
body, unfamiliar diet.

00:38:31.220 --> 00:38:33.620 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Which can bring
a lot of dietary issues,

00:38:33.620 --> 00:38:36.650 align:middle line:84%
digestive issues,
sleeping issues.

00:38:36.650 --> 00:38:38.420 align:middle line:84%
These souls have
a hard time here.

00:38:38.420 --> 00:38:39.460 align:middle line:90%
>> LINDA: Absolutely.

00:38:39.460 --> 00:38:45.320 align:middle line:84%
IPs can contribute in so
many ways to our culture,

00:38:45.320 --> 00:38:49.300 align:middle line:84%
but they can also struggle
so much with being here

00:38:49.300 --> 00:38:55.780 align:middle line:84%
and perhaps have ideas
that we might say need

00:38:55.780 --> 00:39:02.120 align:middle line:84%
to be molded a bit or
calmed a bit or whatever.

00:39:02.120 --> 00:39:08.330 align:middle line:84%
But humanity, humanity is a
work in progress, as we know.

00:39:08.330 --> 00:39:12.290 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So this place
in our collective history,

00:39:12.290 --> 00:39:15.010 align:middle line:84%
it seems to me, as the
time the windows opening

00:39:15.010 --> 00:39:21.400 align:middle line:84%
for the return to a sense of
basic justice, basic morality.

00:39:21.400 --> 00:39:23.200 align:middle line:84%
And I don't mean that
in a churchy sense.

00:39:23.200 --> 00:39:26.830 align:middle line:84%
Basic kindness and
respect for one another.

00:39:26.830 --> 00:39:29.070 align:middle line:84%
And so what are you seeing
with the souls coming in

00:39:29.070 --> 00:39:31.320 align:middle line:84%
and the children of
the people you're

00:39:31.320 --> 00:39:34.260 align:middle line:84%
regressing in terms of the
nature of these kids that

00:39:34.260 --> 00:39:35.260 align:middle line:90%
are coming in now.

00:39:35.260 --> 00:39:37.840 align:middle line:84%
In terms of being more
about the collective,

00:39:37.840 --> 00:39:39.980 align:middle line:84%
are you seeing that
trend happening?

00:39:39.980 --> 00:39:40.780 align:middle line:90%
>> LINDA: Some.

00:39:40.780 --> 00:39:43.950 align:middle line:90%


00:39:43.950 --> 00:39:50.280 align:middle line:84%
I think that humanity is
at a point of almost trying

00:39:50.280 --> 00:39:53.290 align:middle line:84%
to figure out, which
direction are we going?

00:39:53.290 --> 00:39:55.290 align:middle line:84%
Are we becoming more
inclusive or are we

00:39:55.290 --> 00:39:57.720 align:middle line:90%
becoming more exclusive?

00:39:57.720 --> 00:40:00.880 align:middle line:84%
I mean, I certainly see
a lot of young people,

00:40:00.880 --> 00:40:06.690 align:middle line:90%
young people meaning 18 to 25.

00:40:06.690 --> 00:40:10.440 align:middle line:84%
I see a lot of
advanced young people.

00:40:10.440 --> 00:40:14.517 align:middle line:84%
But I also see young people that
don't quite know where they fit.

00:40:14.517 --> 00:40:15.850 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Because they're young.

00:40:15.850 --> 00:40:19.320 align:middle line:84%
One of one of the people I
interviewed who does Vedic

00:40:19.320 --> 00:40:23.310 align:middle line:84%
astrology and handwriting was
saying the interesting thing

00:40:23.310 --> 00:40:30.450 align:middle line:84%
about Gen Zs, for example, is
that their backbone is to have

00:40:30.450 --> 00:40:36.360 align:middle line:84%
strong character, high
moralistic character and strong

00:40:36.360 --> 00:40:40.723 align:middle line:84%
will, but they don't really
mature until their 40s.

00:40:40.723 --> 00:40:43.990 align:middle line:90%


00:40:43.990 --> 00:40:45.790 align:middle line:90%
The oldest is 27 right now.

00:40:45.790 --> 00:40:47.580 align:middle line:84%
I just find that
really interesting

00:40:47.580 --> 00:40:49.870 align:middle line:84%
as a generational
statement if that's true,

00:40:49.870 --> 00:40:51.952 align:middle line:84%
that archetypally,
they want to bring back

00:40:51.952 --> 00:40:53.535 align:middle line:84%
a sense of inclusiveness
and morality.

00:40:53.535 --> 00:40:55.030 align:middle line:90%
But they're still kids.

00:40:55.030 --> 00:40:57.660 align:middle line:84%
They're still on their
games and such right now.

00:40:57.660 --> 00:40:58.770 align:middle line:90%
>> LINDA: Yes.

00:40:58.770 --> 00:41:00.310 align:middle line:90%
I mean, I think that's true.

00:41:00.310 --> 00:41:05.970 align:middle line:84%
But I also see some young people
like undergraduate college age

00:41:05.970 --> 00:41:12.120 align:middle line:84%
young people that are amazingly
advanced and amazingly smart

00:41:12.120 --> 00:41:18.050 align:middle line:84%
and creating new
ideas, new skills,

00:41:18.050 --> 00:41:19.340 align:middle line:90%
new ways of functioning--

00:41:19.340 --> 00:41:20.140 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:41:20.140 --> 00:41:21.560 align:middle line:84%
So some of them
are already awake.

00:41:21.560 --> 00:41:23.360 align:middle line:84%
The rest is going to take
a little longer to wake up,

00:41:23.360 --> 00:41:24.500 align:middle line:90%
it sounds like.

00:41:24.500 --> 00:41:25.923 align:middle line:90%
So I have a question.

00:41:25.923 --> 00:41:27.340 align:middle line:84%
The ones that
you're seeing in who

00:41:27.340 --> 00:41:30.340 align:middle line:84%
are appearing to be very already
awake and advanced and creative

00:41:30.340 --> 00:41:33.490 align:middle line:84%
and bringing these new
technologies, ideas, thoughts

00:41:33.490 --> 00:41:35.890 align:middle line:84%
to the planet, are
they Earth-based souls

00:41:35.890 --> 00:41:37.750 align:middle line:84%
who are simply coming
into a field that's

00:41:37.750 --> 00:41:39.670 align:middle line:90%
more ripe to express that?

00:41:39.670 --> 00:41:42.760 align:middle line:84%
Or are they more IP
souls that are coming in

00:41:42.760 --> 00:41:46.893 align:middle line:84%
with these ideas and knowledge
to help advance us this time?

00:41:46.893 --> 00:41:48.560 align:middle line:84%
>> LINDA: Yeah, that's
a great question.

00:41:48.560 --> 00:41:50.360 align:middle line:90%
And I'm seeing honestly both.

00:41:50.360 --> 00:41:51.160 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Good.

00:41:51.160 --> 00:41:51.960 align:middle line:90%
Excellent.

00:41:51.960 --> 00:41:54.470 align:middle line:84%
>> LINDA: I'm seeing
a lot of both.

00:41:54.470 --> 00:41:57.480 align:middle line:84%
Some of them have been here
over and over and over.

00:41:57.480 --> 00:41:58.730 align:middle line:90%
They're highly advanced souls.

00:41:58.730 --> 00:41:59.563 align:middle line:90%
They're Earth-based.

00:41:59.563 --> 00:42:04.150 align:middle line:84%
But I'm also seeing some
very smart but very unique

00:42:04.150 --> 00:42:09.725 align:middle line:84%
ideas and progressive ideas
that are IPs and angelics.

00:42:09.725 --> 00:42:11.600 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: We only have
a couple minutes left.

00:42:11.600 --> 00:42:13.990 align:middle line:84%
So with all of
this and you do so

00:42:13.990 --> 00:42:19.250 align:middle line:84%
many regressions, which I know,
no the rest for the weary.

00:42:19.250 --> 00:42:20.223 align:middle line:90%
Do you feel hopeful?

00:42:20.223 --> 00:42:22.640 align:middle line:84%
Do you feel good about where
we're headed from what you're

00:42:22.640 --> 00:42:25.070 align:middle line:84%
seeing coming out of
the subconscious of all

00:42:25.070 --> 00:42:29.100 align:middle line:84%
these people's minds, the
deep memory and the forward--

00:42:29.100 --> 00:42:30.643 align:middle line:84%
well, because it's
not linear, time

00:42:30.643 --> 00:42:32.060 align:middle line:84%
is not linear,
some of where we're

00:42:32.060 --> 00:42:35.090 align:middle line:90%
going looking at these people?

00:42:35.090 --> 00:42:36.180 align:middle line:90%
>> LINDA: I would say yes.

00:42:36.180 --> 00:42:39.530 align:middle line:84%
I mean, I tend to be a glass
half full versus a glass half

00:42:39.530 --> 00:42:40.970 align:middle line:90%
empty kind of person.

00:42:40.970 --> 00:42:45.960 align:middle line:84%
But no, I see a lot of
people seeking regression.

00:42:45.960 --> 00:42:48.320 align:middle line:84%
I see a lot of people--
and not just seeking

00:42:48.320 --> 00:42:51.810 align:middle line:84%
to understand past lives, but
seeking to understand, who am I?

00:42:51.810 --> 00:42:53.300 align:middle line:90%
Why am I here?

00:42:53.300 --> 00:42:56.660 align:middle line:84%
Why do I have these
interests, these skills,

00:42:56.660 --> 00:42:58.595 align:middle line:90%
that sort of thing?

00:42:58.595 --> 00:43:01.250 align:middle line:84%
I see a lot of people wanting
to understand themselves

00:43:01.250 --> 00:43:02.820 align:middle line:90%
at a deeper level.

00:43:02.820 --> 00:43:03.982 align:middle line:90%
And so that gives me--

00:43:03.982 --> 00:43:05.190 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: That's a good sign.

00:43:05.190 --> 00:43:05.480 align:middle line:90%
That's helpful.

00:43:05.480 --> 00:43:06.438 align:middle line:90%
>> LINDA: Give me hope.

00:43:06.438 --> 00:43:07.560 align:middle line:90%
Yes, absolutely.

00:43:07.560 --> 00:43:09.393 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Even though
there's a lot of stuff

00:43:09.393 --> 00:43:12.737 align:middle line:84%
there in that subconscious
that we're carrying forward,

00:43:12.737 --> 00:43:14.070 align:middle line:90%
we're just trying to tidy it up.

00:43:14.070 --> 00:43:16.970 align:middle line:84%
Any final thoughts
before we say goodbye?

00:43:16.970 --> 00:43:19.780 align:middle line:10%
>> LINDA: Final thoughts would
just be for people to trust

00:43:19.780 --> 00:43:22.060 align:middle line:10%
they're here with purpose.

00:43:22.060 --> 00:43:24.080 align:middle line:10%
And that purpose isn't--

00:43:24.080 --> 00:43:26.990 align:middle line:10%
that purpose isn't always
something that fits into a box.

00:43:26.990 --> 00:43:28.490 align:middle line:10%
It's not a purpose
that says, well,

00:43:28.490 --> 00:43:35.410 align:middle line:10%
I'm going to be a physician or
whatever, run my own business

00:43:35.410 --> 00:43:36.680 align:middle line:10%
or whatever that might be.

00:43:36.680 --> 00:43:37.910 align:middle line:90%
People are here with purpose.

00:43:37.910 --> 00:43:41.560 align:middle line:84%
Sometimes that is just how
they relate to each other.

00:43:41.560 --> 00:43:45.070 align:middle line:84%
And so trust you're
here with purpose

00:43:45.070 --> 00:43:46.550 align:middle line:90%
and follow your passions.

00:43:46.550 --> 00:43:47.350 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:43:47.350 --> 00:43:48.410 align:middle line:90%
Very good.

00:43:48.410 --> 00:43:49.550 align:middle line:90%
Thank you so much.

00:43:49.550 --> 00:43:51.092 align:middle line:84%
And I'm sure I'll
be seeing you again

00:43:51.092 --> 00:43:52.400 align:middle line:90%
in the not too distant future.

00:43:52.400 --> 00:43:52.790 align:middle line:90%
>> LINDA: Thank you.

00:43:52.790 --> 00:43:53.623 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Thank you.
