>> REGINA MEREDITH: The
debate regarding which school

00:00:20.690 --> 00:00:23.240 align:middle line:10%
of astrology is more
valued continues,

00:00:23.240 --> 00:00:26.070 align:middle line:10%
Western or tropical
Zodiac and Vedic,

00:00:26.070 --> 00:00:27.980 align:middle line:10%
also called sidereal Zodiac.

00:00:27.980 --> 00:00:29.720 align:middle line:84%
Like a lot of people,
we tend to choose

00:00:29.720 --> 00:00:33.360 align:middle line:84%
based on which system most
explains our personality traits.

00:00:33.360 --> 00:00:35.120 align:middle line:84%
That said, today,
we're going to delve

00:00:35.120 --> 00:00:37.700 align:middle line:84%
into Vedic astrology,
the backbone of choosing

00:00:37.700 --> 00:00:41.220 align:middle line:84%
relationships, auspicious
times for business, and more,

00:00:41.220 --> 00:00:46.170 align:middle line:84%
with Brent Becvar, an Associate
of Deepak Chopra's for 33 years,

00:00:46.170 --> 00:00:46.980 align:middle line:90%
so welcome.

00:00:46.980 --> 00:00:49.790 align:middle line:84%
I'm so happy to have you here
and have this conversation

00:00:49.790 --> 00:00:53.270 align:middle line:84%
with you, because I
like a lot of people--

00:00:53.270 --> 00:00:56.420 align:middle line:84%
personally, because you go
on your personality traits,

00:00:56.420 --> 00:00:59.250 align:middle line:84%
and I say, I feel more
of the Vedic thing for me

00:00:59.250 --> 00:01:02.190 align:middle line:84%
than the other one,
all right, tropical.

00:01:02.190 --> 00:01:04.328 align:middle line:84%
But other people feel
the opposite way.

00:01:04.328 --> 00:01:06.120 align:middle line:84%
And we're going to get
into the differences

00:01:06.120 --> 00:01:08.475 align:middle line:90%
between the two and much more.

00:01:08.475 --> 00:01:10.600 align:middle line:84%
But first of all, we need
to get to know you a bit.

00:01:10.600 --> 00:01:13.300 align:middle line:84%
So they already heard me say
Deepak Chopra for 30 years.

00:01:13.300 --> 00:01:14.920 align:middle line:90%
But let's back up before that.

00:01:14.920 --> 00:01:16.305 align:middle line:90%
So you were a psychotherapist?

00:01:16.305 --> 00:01:17.403 align:middle line:90%
>> BRENT BECVAR: Yes.

00:01:17.403 --> 00:01:19.320 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: Let's talk
about that a little bit,

00:01:19.320 --> 00:01:22.830 align:middle line:84%
and how that started feeding
into any kind of usefulness

00:01:22.830 --> 00:01:25.566 align:middle line:84%
in this profession
now as an astrologer.

00:01:25.566 --> 00:01:28.290 align:middle line:10%
>> BECVAR: I think I've always
been interested in going

00:01:28.290 --> 00:01:30.370 align:middle line:10%
into the mystery
to find the truth.

00:01:30.370 --> 00:01:32.130 align:middle line:10%
I think I can see
that as something

00:01:32.130 --> 00:01:33.910 align:middle line:10%
consistent throughout my life.

00:01:33.910 --> 00:01:37.530 align:middle line:84%
I was always interested
in going into the mystery.

00:01:37.530 --> 00:01:40.468 align:middle line:10%
And I was actually
interested in astrology

00:01:40.468 --> 00:01:42.010 align:middle line:10%
before I knew there
was such a thing.

00:01:42.010 --> 00:01:43.560 align:middle line:10%
I would meet
someone, I would want

00:01:43.560 --> 00:01:45.660 align:middle line:10%
to know when they were born.

00:01:45.660 --> 00:01:48.940 align:middle line:10%
And I felt like I had some
sense, even as a child.

00:01:48.940 --> 00:01:51.440 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: You wanted to know
the birth date, even as a kid?

00:01:51.440 --> 00:01:53.732 align:middle line:84%
Like it was giving you some
kind of hidden information.

00:01:53.732 --> 00:01:54.540 align:middle line:90%
>> BECVAR: Yeah.

00:01:54.540 --> 00:01:55.440 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Interesting.

00:01:55.440 --> 00:01:56.648 align:middle line:90%
Yeah, you're born to do that.

00:01:56.648 --> 00:01:58.080 align:middle line:90%
>> BECVAR: I can't explain it.

00:01:58.080 --> 00:02:00.640 align:middle line:84%
During the course of my life,
I've lived here in Boulder,

00:02:00.640 --> 00:02:01.440 align:middle line:90%
actually.

00:02:01.440 --> 00:02:04.360 align:middle line:90%
I was at CU as a student.

00:02:04.360 --> 00:02:07.540 align:middle line:84%
And I got very
interested in yoga.

00:02:07.540 --> 00:02:09.930 align:middle line:84%
At that time, I was
about 20 years old.

00:02:09.930 --> 00:02:14.160 align:middle line:84%
And I became a yoga teacher
with Swami Satchidananda.

00:02:14.160 --> 00:02:16.920 align:middle line:84%
Integral Yoga
Institute was here.

00:02:16.920 --> 00:02:20.640 align:middle line:84%
And I began to explore
the Vedic tradition

00:02:20.640 --> 00:02:23.820 align:middle line:90%
from that time in my life.

00:02:23.820 --> 00:02:28.380 align:middle line:84%
I then did get my
masters in psychology

00:02:28.380 --> 00:02:31.030 align:middle line:84%
and began working in
traditional psychotherapy.

00:02:31.030 --> 00:02:34.380 align:middle line:84%
But I didn't find it
very satisfying for me.

00:02:34.380 --> 00:02:36.790 align:middle line:90%
I focused on gestalt therapy.

00:02:36.790 --> 00:02:40.530 align:middle line:84%
That was the mentor that
I had in graduate school.

00:02:40.530 --> 00:02:42.520 align:middle line:84%
But I was always
interested in yoga,

00:02:42.520 --> 00:02:45.060 align:middle line:84%
and I always felt like I
wanted to somehow marry

00:02:45.060 --> 00:02:49.360 align:middle line:84%
the Vedic tradition with
psychotherapy or with therapy.

00:02:49.360 --> 00:02:51.790 align:middle line:84%
It's a longer story
how I met Deepak,

00:02:51.790 --> 00:02:53.752 align:middle line:90%
but I did begin to explore.

00:02:53.752 --> 00:02:56.210 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: Wasn't there a little
detour along the way, too,

00:02:56.210 --> 00:02:56.670 align:middle line:90%
in advertising?

00:02:56.670 --> 00:02:57.610 align:middle line:90%
>> BECVAR: I did, yes.

00:02:57.610 --> 00:02:58.670 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: Yeah,
let's talk about that.

00:02:58.670 --> 00:03:01.045 align:middle line:84%
Because I mean, it all kind
of comes together in the end.

00:03:01.045 --> 00:03:03.830 align:middle line:84%
>> BECVAR: Well, it was actually
a good transition for me

00:03:03.830 --> 00:03:04.630 align:middle line:90%
at the time after.

00:03:04.630 --> 00:03:09.190 align:middle line:84%
I got a little disenchanted with
psychotherapy after a few years.

00:03:09.190 --> 00:03:11.830 align:middle line:84%
So I took a break
and I got into--

00:03:11.830 --> 00:03:15.880 align:middle line:84%
I took a vocational
preference test.

00:03:15.880 --> 00:03:18.110 align:middle line:84%
Then I used to give to
my clients at times,

00:03:18.110 --> 00:03:21.610 align:middle line:84%
and I had a very high score in
advertising, which was something

00:03:21.610 --> 00:03:23.390 align:middle line:90%
I was surprised about.

00:03:23.390 --> 00:03:25.360 align:middle line:90%
And I thought, that sounds fun.

00:03:25.360 --> 00:03:27.650 align:middle line:84%
I loved media, I
loved television.

00:03:27.650 --> 00:03:32.320 align:middle line:84%
And through some contacts
of my father's, I

00:03:32.320 --> 00:03:34.630 align:middle line:84%
got into a television
station and began

00:03:34.630 --> 00:03:35.875 align:middle line:90%
working in advertising.

00:03:35.875 --> 00:03:36.675 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Where?

00:03:36.675 --> 00:03:40.142 align:middle line:84%
>> BECVAR: At that time,
in Louisville, Kentucky.

00:03:40.142 --> 00:03:43.540 align:middle line:84%
And I began writing commercials,
and directing commercials,

00:03:43.540 --> 00:03:45.050 align:middle line:90%
and also I had clients.

00:03:45.050 --> 00:03:46.250 align:middle line:90%
And it was really fun.

00:03:46.250 --> 00:03:47.710 align:middle line:90%
I learned a lot.

00:03:47.710 --> 00:03:50.200 align:middle line:84%
I learned a lot about
many different businesses

00:03:50.200 --> 00:03:51.830 align:middle line:84%
and many different
kinds of people.

00:03:51.830 --> 00:03:53.930 align:middle line:90%
I was a bit shy before that.

00:03:53.930 --> 00:03:57.090 align:middle line:84%
So it was a good 10,
11 years in my life.

00:03:57.090 --> 00:04:00.020 align:middle line:84%
But then I came to a
point where I really

00:04:00.020 --> 00:04:03.470 align:middle line:84%
didn't feel that I
was doing anything

00:04:03.470 --> 00:04:05.460 align:middle line:90%
of real importance for me.

00:04:05.460 --> 00:04:07.220 align:middle line:84%
Nothing wrong with
advertising, but I

00:04:07.220 --> 00:04:11.780 align:middle line:84%
didn't feel like I was really
in alignment with my nature.

00:04:11.780 --> 00:04:15.200 align:middle line:84%
And I talk a lot about
this with my clients

00:04:15.200 --> 00:04:21.529 align:middle line:84%
because we all have a dharma,
a purpose, you might say.

00:04:21.529 --> 00:04:24.000 align:middle line:84%
And when we're in
alignment with our nature,

00:04:24.000 --> 00:04:27.090 align:middle line:84%
we feel fulfilled just
in doing that thing,

00:04:27.090 --> 00:04:29.150 align:middle line:84%
much as I'm sure you
do in doing the work

00:04:29.150 --> 00:04:30.930 align:middle line:84%
you've been doing
all these many years.

00:04:30.930 --> 00:04:32.480 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: I found out this
morning that you had seen

00:04:32.480 --> 00:04:33.030 align:middle line:90%
my chart.

00:04:33.030 --> 00:04:33.850 align:middle line:90%
You have seen my chart.

00:04:33.850 --> 00:04:34.650 align:middle line:90%
>> BECVAR: I did.

00:04:34.650 --> 00:04:37.680 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: And you said that I'm
right where I'm supposed to be,

00:04:37.680 --> 00:04:38.480 align:middle line:90%
dharma-wise.

00:04:38.480 --> 00:04:40.800 align:middle line:84%
>> BECVAR: Absolutely,
absolutely.

00:04:40.800 --> 00:04:45.180 align:middle line:84%
And you're doing a
great service to others.

00:04:45.180 --> 00:04:50.360 align:middle line:84%
You're playing your part
in this big play we're in.

00:04:50.360 --> 00:04:52.440 align:middle line:84%
So it is important
that we really

00:04:52.440 --> 00:04:54.370 align:middle line:84%
try to find out what
we're meant to do,

00:04:54.370 --> 00:04:55.690 align:middle line:90%
because we all have a purpose.

00:04:55.690 --> 00:04:58.080 align:middle line:84%
We all have something
that we can contribute.

00:04:58.080 --> 00:05:03.190 align:middle line:84%
And when we do, we feel
exalted in doing that thing.

00:05:03.190 --> 00:05:04.690 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: Well,
it's so fulfilling.

00:05:04.690 --> 00:05:05.970 align:middle line:90%
It takes a lot of--

00:05:05.970 --> 00:05:09.030 align:middle line:84%
I mean, I find I don't
have a lot of the anxieties

00:05:09.030 --> 00:05:12.300 align:middle line:84%
that people tend
to have in my life

00:05:12.300 --> 00:05:16.510 align:middle line:84%
because I connected with my
dharma so early on in life.

00:05:16.510 --> 00:05:19.770 align:middle line:84%
And so I didn't really
question, why am I here?

00:05:19.770 --> 00:05:20.830 align:middle line:90%
Should I be doing this?

00:05:20.830 --> 00:05:22.330 align:middle line:84%
I don't have any
of those questions.

00:05:22.330 --> 00:05:23.510 align:middle line:90%
I just kept proceeding forward.

00:05:23.510 --> 00:05:24.960 align:middle line:84%
>> BECVAR: You were really
lucky and fortunate.

00:05:24.960 --> 00:05:25.280 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: I was very lucky.

00:05:25.280 --> 00:05:28.200 align:middle line:84%
>> BECVAR: And it shows in
your chart because of the--

00:05:28.200 --> 00:05:30.120 align:middle line:84%
I told you, the ruler
of your ascendant

00:05:30.120 --> 00:05:32.380 align:middle line:84%
is in the ninth house,
the house of dharma.

00:05:32.380 --> 00:05:35.470 align:middle line:84%
And it gives this sort of
lifelong pursuit of knowledge

00:05:35.470 --> 00:05:36.270 align:middle line:90%
as well.

00:05:36.270 --> 00:05:37.070 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Yes.

00:05:37.070 --> 00:05:40.740 align:middle line:84%
>> BECVAR: When we're in
alignment with dharma,

00:05:40.740 --> 00:05:44.237 align:middle line:84%
we don't have that empty
feeling like I need something,

00:05:44.237 --> 00:05:45.070 align:middle line:90%
something's missing.

00:05:45.070 --> 00:05:45.385 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Exactly, yeah.

00:05:45.385 --> 00:05:46.385 align:middle line:90%
>> BECVAR: And I think--

00:05:46.385 --> 00:05:49.030 align:middle line:84%
I do talk about this
subject with my clients.

00:05:49.030 --> 00:05:51.360 align:middle line:84%
There's a beautiful
body of knowledge

00:05:51.360 --> 00:05:53.710 align:middle line:84%
from the Vedic tradition
called the Purusharthas,

00:05:53.710 --> 00:05:54.627 align:middle line:90%
the four aims of life.

00:05:54.627 --> 00:05:56.335 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: We're going
to get into those.

00:05:56.335 --> 00:05:58.260 align:middle line:84%
But let's find out how
you finally discovered

00:05:58.260 --> 00:06:01.300 align:middle line:84%
your own dharma after you were
dissatisfied with advertising.

00:06:01.300 --> 00:06:04.967 align:middle line:84%
>> BECVAR: About that time, I
was starting to feel like, OK,

00:06:04.967 --> 00:06:05.800 align:middle line:90%
something's missing.

00:06:05.800 --> 00:06:09.250 align:middle line:84%
And I really began
to pray sincerely.

00:06:09.250 --> 00:06:11.650 align:middle line:84%
And something shifted in my
heart when that happened.

00:06:11.650 --> 00:06:14.670 align:middle line:84%
And shortly after that,
through an interesting set

00:06:14.670 --> 00:06:18.065 align:middle line:84%
of circumstances, I met
Dr. Chopra, Deepak Chopra.

00:06:18.065 --> 00:06:19.370 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: That's a big leap.

00:06:19.370 --> 00:06:22.870 align:middle line:84%
>> BECVAR: It was one of the
greatest gifts in my life,

00:06:22.870 --> 00:06:24.330 align:middle line:90%
I'll tell you.

00:06:24.330 --> 00:06:27.730 align:middle line:84%
He's been a great friend and
mentor over these many 33 years.

00:06:27.730 --> 00:06:33.420 align:middle line:84%
But through a remarkable
series of coincidences

00:06:33.420 --> 00:06:37.260 align:middle line:84%
and synchronicities and good
fortune and karma, I guess,

00:06:37.260 --> 00:06:41.340 align:middle line:84%
I was invited to come and work
for him up in Massachusetts.

00:06:41.340 --> 00:06:45.690 align:middle line:84%
And as an administrator
there, that

00:06:45.690 --> 00:06:47.950 align:middle line:84%
began, as I said,
33 years ago, but it

00:06:47.950 --> 00:06:49.780 align:middle line:84%
was right at the
beginning of that time

00:06:49.780 --> 00:06:51.800 align:middle line:90%
that I met a Vedic astrologer.

00:06:51.800 --> 00:06:53.600 align:middle line:84%
And I'd been interested
in astrology,

00:06:53.600 --> 00:06:55.240 align:middle line:90%
as I said, since I was little.

00:06:55.240 --> 00:06:57.930 align:middle line:84%
Even studied Western
astrology for 20 years.

00:06:57.930 --> 00:06:58.730 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Yeah.

00:06:58.730 --> 00:07:01.850 align:middle line:84%
>> BECVAR: So I knew there
was something to astrology.

00:07:01.850 --> 00:07:06.160 align:middle line:84%
And I have compassion
for people that

00:07:06.160 --> 00:07:09.520 align:middle line:84%
are attached to
their Western chart

00:07:09.520 --> 00:07:13.780 align:middle line:84%
because I think we know there's
some truth that can be found

00:07:13.780 --> 00:07:15.790 align:middle line:90%
in this knowledge of astrology.

00:07:15.790 --> 00:07:21.820 align:middle line:84%
Every exalted wisdom tradition,
every culture, exalted culture,

00:07:21.820 --> 00:07:26.510 align:middle line:84%
has had a very high knowledge
of astrology/astronomy.

00:07:26.510 --> 00:07:29.170 align:middle line:84%
It was one thing,
astrology/astronomy.

00:07:29.170 --> 00:07:33.070 align:middle line:84%
So I think we sense that we're
not separate from this greater

00:07:33.070 --> 00:07:35.200 align:middle line:84%
body of the universe, and
there's something for us

00:07:35.200 --> 00:07:38.660 align:middle line:84%
to learn in the same way that
we're connected to the cycles,

00:07:38.660 --> 00:07:44.630 align:middle line:84%
the sidereal, the circadian
rhythm of day and night.

00:07:44.630 --> 00:07:47.688 align:middle line:84%
The lunar rhythms, of course,
we're intimately connected.

00:07:47.688 --> 00:07:49.980 align:middle line:84%
And everything in nature is
connected to these rhythms.

00:07:49.980 --> 00:07:52.620 align:middle line:84%
The seasonal rhythms, and
these greater rhythms,

00:07:52.620 --> 00:07:54.980 align:middle line:84%
these planetary
rhythms are very much

00:07:54.980 --> 00:07:57.150 align:middle line:90%
a part of our bigger awareness.

00:07:57.150 --> 00:08:00.480 align:middle line:84%
Maybe not all the time of
our conscious awareness,

00:08:00.480 --> 00:08:04.020 align:middle line:84%
but our super conscious
awareness, let's say.

00:08:04.020 --> 00:08:06.150 align:middle line:84%
I kept studying
Western astrology.

00:08:06.150 --> 00:08:08.160 align:middle line:84%
I often say it was like
an article of clothing

00:08:08.160 --> 00:08:09.300 align:middle line:90%
I wanted to squeeze into.

00:08:09.300 --> 00:08:12.780 align:middle line:84%
I wanted to wear it, but
it didn't quite fit for me.

00:08:12.780 --> 00:08:15.180 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: So you weren't--
like I said in the open,

00:08:15.180 --> 00:08:17.790 align:middle line:84%
you weren't even on
a personal level,

00:08:17.790 --> 00:08:21.080 align:middle line:84%
particularly identifying with
what was assigned to you via

00:08:21.080 --> 00:08:22.460 align:middle line:90%
Western astrology, I take it.

00:08:22.460 --> 00:08:24.650 align:middle line:84%
You felt there was
something that needed

00:08:24.650 --> 00:08:25.950 align:middle line:90%
to shift in that for you?

00:08:25.950 --> 00:08:30.200 align:middle line:84%
>> BECVAR: Yeah, I mean,
like a lot of people that are

00:08:30.200 --> 00:08:33.740 align:middle line:84%
interested in Western astrology,
I kind of align myself with

00:08:33.740 --> 00:08:39.080 align:middle line:84%
those planetary positions,
the rising sign, the sun sign,

00:08:39.080 --> 00:08:41.929 align:middle line:84%
and all the other
planetary positions.

00:08:41.929 --> 00:08:46.130 align:middle line:84%
But somehow, it just didn't
quite fit, as I said.

00:08:46.130 --> 00:08:50.060 align:middle line:84%
And when I met this
Vedic astrologer,

00:08:50.060 --> 00:08:56.220 align:middle line:84%
this was an important moment in
my life because he did my chart.

00:08:56.220 --> 00:09:00.710 align:middle line:84%
And for the first time in my
life, I felt that that suit fit.

00:09:00.710 --> 00:09:02.240 align:middle line:84%
It was exactly
because everything

00:09:02.240 --> 00:09:05.150 align:middle line:84%
is different in a Vedic
chart by 24 degrees

00:09:05.150 --> 00:09:06.925 align:middle line:90%
from a Western tropical chart.

00:09:06.925 --> 00:09:10.790 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: So it almost slides
everything three weeks forward

00:09:10.790 --> 00:09:12.080 align:middle line:90%
or backward.

00:09:12.080 --> 00:09:16.580 align:middle line:84%
So for example, in my chart,
I would be a Scorpio somewhere

00:09:16.580 --> 00:09:18.870 align:middle line:90%
around the November 14 area.

00:09:18.870 --> 00:09:19.880 align:middle line:90%
So in everything seems--

00:09:19.880 --> 00:09:20.510 align:middle line:90%
>> BECVAR: Happy birthday.

00:09:20.510 --> 00:09:21.500 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Thank you.

00:09:21.500 --> 00:09:23.330 align:middle line:84%
It seems to slide
everything back

00:09:23.330 --> 00:09:25.457 align:middle line:84%
into the later degrees of
Libra about three weeks.

00:09:25.457 --> 00:09:26.540 align:middle line:90%
>> BECVAR: That's correct.

00:09:26.540 --> 00:09:28.490 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: So if everyone's
looking at their chart roughly,

00:09:28.490 --> 00:09:30.350 align:middle line:84%
if you in your
mind can calculate,

00:09:30.350 --> 00:09:31.950 align:middle line:90%
slide it back about three weeks.

00:09:31.950 --> 00:09:33.960 align:middle line:84%
>> BECVAR: Everything in the
horoscope moves 24 degrees.

00:09:33.960 --> 00:09:34.070 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Yeah.

00:09:34.070 --> 00:09:36.070 align:middle line:84%
>> BECVAR: But most
especially, the rising sign,

00:09:36.070 --> 00:09:39.170 align:middle line:84%
because we don't think of you in
terms of your sun sign as much

00:09:39.170 --> 00:09:41.280 align:middle line:84%
in the Vedic chart
as your rising sign.

00:09:41.280 --> 00:09:45.330 align:middle line:84%
The rising sign is just as
we're turning with the planet

00:09:45.330 --> 00:09:47.880 align:middle line:90%
as we are right now.

00:09:47.880 --> 00:09:51.580 align:middle line:84%
And as the sun appeared to rise
this morning, it wasn't rising,

00:09:51.580 --> 00:09:53.320 align:middle line:84%
we were just turning
in relation to it.

00:09:53.320 --> 00:09:55.420 align:middle line:84%
In the same way, as we
turn with the planet,

00:09:55.420 --> 00:09:58.890 align:middle line:84%
different constellations will
appear on the Eastern horizon

00:09:58.890 --> 00:10:00.790 align:middle line:84%
at different times
of the day and night.

00:10:00.790 --> 00:10:03.390 align:middle line:84%
And they change about
every hour to two hours.

00:10:03.390 --> 00:10:07.620 align:middle line:84%
So that really sets
up the relationship

00:10:07.620 --> 00:10:10.202 align:middle line:84%
of all, the relationship
of the planets

00:10:10.202 --> 00:10:12.410 align:middle line:84%
at the time of a person's
birth to the event of the--

00:10:12.410 --> 00:10:14.460 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: So the rising sun
takes precedence over the sun

00:10:14.460 --> 00:10:15.545 align:middle line:90%
sign in Vedic astrology?

00:10:15.545 --> 00:10:16.775 align:middle line:90%
>> BECVAR: Yes, it does.

00:10:16.775 --> 00:10:18.400 align:middle line:84%
Yeah, it's the first
thing to consider,

00:10:18.400 --> 00:10:24.300 align:middle line:84%
because then you see how all the
other planetary positions relate

00:10:24.300 --> 00:10:26.610 align:middle line:90%
to that moment of birth.

00:10:26.610 --> 00:10:29.910 align:middle line:84%
And the rising sun
does give a lot of--

00:10:29.910 --> 00:10:32.620 align:middle line:84%
has a lot to do with the
personality, the physical body,

00:10:32.620 --> 00:10:36.120 align:middle line:84%
the way we present ourselves to
the world and a lot of the way

00:10:36.120 --> 00:10:39.060 align:middle line:84%
we're perceived
by others as well.

00:10:39.060 --> 00:10:43.160 align:middle line:84%
The moon position is
also very important,

00:10:43.160 --> 00:10:46.250 align:middle line:84%
and the moon has a lot
to do with the manas,

00:10:46.250 --> 00:10:48.500 align:middle line:84%
the intuitive mind,
the subtle mind.

00:10:48.500 --> 00:10:50.540 align:middle line:84%
I think of it as
being that aspect,

00:10:50.540 --> 00:10:54.460 align:middle line:84%
that very sensitive aspect of
ourselves which is constantly

00:10:54.460 --> 00:10:55.430 align:middle line:90%
discerning.

00:10:55.430 --> 00:10:57.130 align:middle line:84%
Is this a nourishing
impression that's

00:10:57.130 --> 00:10:58.960 align:middle line:84%
coming in through
the five senses

00:10:58.960 --> 00:11:00.650 align:middle line:90%
from the environment for me?

00:11:00.650 --> 00:11:02.060 align:middle line:90%
Or is it not nourishing?

00:11:02.060 --> 00:11:06.020 align:middle line:84%
So we're always a little-- and
that's our intuition, really.

00:11:06.020 --> 00:11:08.030 align:middle line:84%
And our sixth sense,
we're always--

00:11:08.030 --> 00:11:09.680 align:middle line:84%
is this a nourishing--
is this safe?

00:11:09.680 --> 00:11:12.320 align:middle line:84%
Is this something I want
to take in or is it not?

00:11:12.320 --> 00:11:15.000 align:middle line:84%
So the moon is very
important because the moon

00:11:15.000 --> 00:11:17.500 align:middle line:84%
and where the mind goes, that's
kind of where the rest of us

00:11:17.500 --> 00:11:18.300 align:middle line:90%
goes.

00:11:18.300 --> 00:11:20.950 align:middle line:84%
And in the state of
the mind determines

00:11:20.950 --> 00:11:25.880 align:middle line:84%
how much joy we take in our
experience moment to moment,

00:11:25.880 --> 00:11:28.600 align:middle line:84%
or if we're just on
guard all the time,

00:11:28.600 --> 00:11:31.300 align:middle line:84%
the sympathetic nervous
system as opposed

00:11:31.300 --> 00:11:33.040 align:middle line:84%
to the parasympathetic
nervous system.

00:11:33.040 --> 00:11:35.990 align:middle line:84%
So the moon is very important
part of the horoscope.

00:11:35.990 --> 00:11:40.120 align:middle line:84%
Also, in the Vedic
chart, the planet

00:11:40.120 --> 00:11:43.070 align:middle line:84%
that rules your rising sign
is also very important.

00:11:43.070 --> 00:11:46.000 align:middle line:84%
And each of the
12 ascendants has

00:11:46.000 --> 00:11:51.070 align:middle line:84%
one planet that presents the
qualities of that rising sign.

00:11:51.070 --> 00:11:54.490 align:middle line:84%
People that are ruled
by Venus, Taurus, rising

00:11:54.490 --> 00:11:56.350 align:middle line:84%
in the Vedic system,
and Libra rising

00:11:56.350 --> 00:11:58.610 align:middle line:84%
are ruled by Venus
or more Venusian.

00:11:58.610 --> 00:12:02.720 align:middle line:84%
They're more relational,
they're interested in harmony,

00:12:02.720 --> 00:12:07.620 align:middle line:84%
often, interested in balance
and design and fairness.

00:12:07.620 --> 00:12:09.142 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: The
beauty of all kinds.

00:12:09.142 --> 00:12:10.600 align:middle line:84%
>> BECVAR: The
beauty of all kinds.

00:12:10.600 --> 00:12:11.830 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: Harmony
and beauty, yeah.

00:12:11.830 --> 00:12:13.540 align:middle line:84%
>> BECVAR: Harmony
and beauty, exactly.

00:12:13.540 --> 00:12:17.600 align:middle line:84%
And as I said, you've got a
prominent Venus in your chart.

00:12:17.600 --> 00:12:19.910 align:middle line:84%
People that are ruled
by Mars, however,

00:12:19.910 --> 00:12:21.680 align:middle line:90%
can have a lot of drive.

00:12:21.680 --> 00:12:26.620 align:middle line:84%
Mars is that planet of courage,
passion, energy, which we like

00:12:26.620 --> 00:12:29.210 align:middle line:84%
and it can make a
person a self-starter.

00:12:29.210 --> 00:12:31.598 align:middle line:84%
It can make them a
good athlete or--

00:12:31.598 --> 00:12:32.515 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Rebellious.

00:12:32.515 --> 00:12:35.540 align:middle line:84%
>> BECVAR: Warrior or
rebellious, yeah, of course.

00:12:35.540 --> 00:12:38.040 align:middle line:84%
But there's the shadow
side of every planet.

00:12:38.040 --> 00:12:39.780 align:middle line:84%
So you can give
irritability, anger,

00:12:39.780 --> 00:12:44.570 align:middle line:84%
impatience at times,
inflammatory disorders.

00:12:44.570 --> 00:12:48.980 align:middle line:84%
Mercurial people, Gemini
rising and Virgo rising people

00:12:48.980 --> 00:12:50.550 align:middle line:90%
are ruled by Mercury.

00:12:50.550 --> 00:12:53.390 align:middle line:84%
So Mercury, planet
of the intellect,

00:12:53.390 --> 00:12:56.510 align:middle line:90%
planet of communications a lot.

00:12:56.510 --> 00:13:00.120 align:middle line:84%
And Sagittarius is
ruled by Jupiter.

00:13:00.120 --> 00:13:04.700 align:middle line:84%
And Pisces is ruled by Jupiter,
Capricorn by Saturn and Aquarius

00:13:04.700 --> 00:13:06.960 align:middle line:90%
by Saturn in the Vedic system.

00:13:06.960 --> 00:13:09.320 align:middle line:84%
We don't use the
outer Saturan planets

00:13:09.320 --> 00:13:10.725 align:middle line:90%
of Uranus, Pluto, Neptune.

00:13:10.725 --> 00:13:11.870 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Oh, not at all?

00:13:11.870 --> 00:13:12.450 align:middle line:90%
>> BECVAR: Not at all.

00:13:12.450 --> 00:13:12.750 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Oh, interesting.

00:13:12.750 --> 00:13:15.510 align:middle line:84%
>> BECVAR: I mean, many Vedic
astrologers will include them.

00:13:15.510 --> 00:13:17.700 align:middle line:84%
I do include them
when I do a chart.

00:13:17.700 --> 00:13:21.590 align:middle line:84%
But traditional Vedic
astrology utilizes

00:13:21.590 --> 00:13:24.390 align:middle line:84%
what are called the true
planets, the visible planets.

00:13:24.390 --> 00:13:28.670 align:middle line:84%
And the system is very elegant
if you look at a Vedic chart.

00:13:28.670 --> 00:13:33.800 align:middle line:84%
Because Cancer and Leo are
right together, sun and moon.

00:13:33.800 --> 00:13:37.350 align:middle line:84%
And then next you have the
mercury-ruled constellations

00:13:37.350 --> 00:13:39.220 align:middle line:90%
of Gemini and Virgo.

00:13:39.220 --> 00:13:42.250 align:middle line:84%
Then you have Libra and
Taurus ruled by Venus.

00:13:42.250 --> 00:13:45.100 align:middle line:84%
Then you have Aries and
Scorpio ruled by Mars.

00:13:45.100 --> 00:13:47.850 align:middle line:84%
Then Pisces, Sagittarius
ruled by Jupiter,

00:13:47.850 --> 00:13:51.420 align:middle line:84%
and Capricorn and Aquarius
ruled by Saturn, farthest

00:13:51.420 --> 00:13:52.530 align:middle line:90%
from the sun.

00:13:52.530 --> 00:13:56.530 align:middle line:84%
So honestly, in
doing a Vedic chart,

00:13:56.530 --> 00:13:59.730 align:middle line:84%
I don't really find I need
to use the outer Saturn

00:13:59.730 --> 00:14:03.285 align:middle line:84%
planets, although
they're certainly useful,

00:14:03.285 --> 00:14:04.085 align:middle line:90%
can be very useful.

00:14:04.085 --> 00:14:05.710 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: Well, what
about the notion,

00:14:05.710 --> 00:14:10.000 align:middle line:84%
like the Age of Aquarius, that
happened on November 19, 2024,

00:14:10.000 --> 00:14:12.270 align:middle line:90%
in Western astrology?

00:14:12.270 --> 00:14:16.360 align:middle line:84%
What is the actual date of
entering that Aquarian period?

00:14:16.360 --> 00:14:18.370 align:middle line:90%
Although that's Pluto.

00:14:18.370 --> 00:14:20.650 align:middle line:84%
If you don't recognize
Pluto, how does that all--

00:14:20.650 --> 00:14:23.220 align:middle line:84%
how does the Age of Aquarius
work in the Vedic chart, then?

00:14:23.220 --> 00:14:25.980 align:middle line:84%
>> BECVAR: The Age of Aquarius,
I think I started to say that

00:14:25.980 --> 00:14:29.190 align:middle line:84%
because of that wobble
in the spin of the Earth,

00:14:29.190 --> 00:14:35.350 align:middle line:84%
the point where the sun rises
every spring equinox is the way

00:14:35.350 --> 00:14:38.510 align:middle line:90%
we determine the planetary age.

00:14:38.510 --> 00:14:43.120 align:middle line:84%
So in Western
astrology, they say that

00:14:43.120 --> 00:14:45.720 align:middle line:90%
on April, March 15 to April--

00:14:45.720 --> 00:14:46.520 align:middle line:90%
what is it?

00:14:46.520 --> 00:14:51.050 align:middle line:90%
March 21 to April 21 is Aries.

00:14:51.050 --> 00:14:52.060 align:middle line:90%
If the sun is--

00:14:52.060 --> 00:14:54.680 align:middle line:84%
I mean, if you're born at that
time, the sun was in Aries.

00:14:54.680 --> 00:14:59.860 align:middle line:84%
Well, the sun hasn't risen in
Aries on those dates in over

00:14:59.860 --> 00:15:00.980 align:middle line:90%
1,800 years.

00:15:00.980 --> 00:15:02.530 align:middle line:90%
It's been precessing.

00:15:02.530 --> 00:15:04.480 align:middle line:84%
Because of that wobble,
it's been rising

00:15:04.480 --> 00:15:06.410 align:middle line:90%
in the constellation of Pisces.

00:15:06.410 --> 00:15:10.070 align:middle line:84%
And we've been in the Piscean
age as a result of this.

00:15:10.070 --> 00:15:14.787 align:middle line:84%
A planetary age, an astrological
age lasts about 2,150 years,

00:15:14.787 --> 00:15:15.620 align:middle line:90%
something like that.

00:15:15.620 --> 00:15:17.330 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: So when do we
scooch on over into Aquarius?

00:15:17.330 --> 00:15:19.010 align:middle line:84%
>> BECVAR: So we're not
quite scootched in just yet,

00:15:19.010 --> 00:15:20.220 align:middle line:90%
but we're in the cusp phase.

00:15:20.220 --> 00:15:21.352 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: OK.

00:15:21.352 --> 00:15:24.790 align:middle line:84%
>> BECVAR: And because of
that, we're starting to feel

00:15:24.790 --> 00:15:26.170 align:middle line:90%
the shift.

00:15:26.170 --> 00:15:29.930 align:middle line:84%
We're starting to feel the
influence of this new period.

00:15:29.930 --> 00:15:32.650 align:middle line:84%
And I think-- an
astrologer friend of mine

00:15:32.650 --> 00:15:34.600 align:middle line:84%
would say that when
we're approaching

00:15:34.600 --> 00:15:38.380 align:middle line:84%
a shift, an astrological
shift, our attention is

00:15:38.380 --> 00:15:42.440 align:middle line:84%
on that new territory and we're
starting to think more about it,

00:15:42.440 --> 00:15:44.710 align:middle line:84%
and we're feeling some
of the influence of that.

00:15:44.710 --> 00:15:49.520 align:middle line:84%
So because of this shift that
we're experiencing already,

00:15:49.520 --> 00:15:52.070 align:middle line:84%
a lot of the old forms
are breaking down.

00:15:52.070 --> 00:15:55.190 align:middle line:84%
The old governmental forms,
the old religious forms,

00:15:55.190 --> 00:15:57.410 align:middle line:84%
the old economic forms,
the old social forms,

00:15:57.410 --> 00:15:58.670 align:middle line:90%
they're not working.

00:15:58.670 --> 00:16:02.030 align:middle line:84%
And as a result, there's
a lot of chaos and fear.

00:16:02.030 --> 00:16:03.910 align:middle line:84%
And a lot of people are
holding on for dear--

00:16:03.910 --> 00:16:06.410 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: Which makes people
want to cling to it even more.

00:16:06.410 --> 00:16:07.210 align:middle line:90%
>> BECVAR: Exactly.

00:16:07.210 --> 00:16:10.450 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: Reinstantiate all
the old ways because Aquarius is

00:16:10.450 --> 00:16:11.805 align:middle line:90%
about innovation.

00:16:11.805 --> 00:16:12.850 align:middle line:90%
>> BECVAR: Beautiful.

00:16:12.850 --> 00:16:13.280 align:middle line:90%
Exactly, yeah.

00:16:13.280 --> 00:16:15.980 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: I mean, and we have
to start from scratch, really,

00:16:15.980 --> 00:16:17.510 align:middle line:90%
and rebuild all these things.

00:16:17.510 --> 00:16:19.430 align:middle line:84%
And a lot of people
feel they're not ready,

00:16:19.430 --> 00:16:20.500 align:middle line:90%
but their soul is here.

00:16:20.500 --> 00:16:21.300 align:middle line:90%
>> BECVAR: Well--

00:16:21.300 --> 00:16:22.130 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: They're ready.

00:16:22.130 --> 00:16:23.547 align:middle line:84%
>> BECVAR: --it's
going to happen.

00:16:23.547 --> 00:16:24.980 align:middle line:90%
And it will happen gradually.

00:16:24.980 --> 00:16:26.980 align:middle line:84%
But people that
are living in fear

00:16:26.980 --> 00:16:29.660 align:middle line:84%
and holding on to these
ultra-conservative ideas

00:16:29.660 --> 00:16:31.950 align:middle line:84%
or fundamentalist
religious ideas,

00:16:31.950 --> 00:16:33.420 align:middle line:90%
it's all going to fall away.

00:16:33.420 --> 00:16:36.080 align:middle line:10%
I'm sorry, but it will.

00:16:36.080 --> 00:16:39.710 align:middle line:10%
And new forms will
develop, new consciousness.

00:16:39.710 --> 00:16:44.450 align:middle line:84%
And I think everything
that Gaia represents

00:16:44.450 --> 00:16:48.325 align:middle line:84%
is about making this shift
into this new consciousness.

00:16:48.325 --> 00:16:49.640 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: I think so.

00:16:49.640 --> 00:16:51.930 align:middle line:84%
>> BECVAR: All of the people
that you've talked with,

00:16:51.930 --> 00:16:54.530 align:middle line:84%
all the shows that you
do, it's all about this.

00:16:54.530 --> 00:16:58.190 align:middle line:84%
So it's not like there's a
point where suddenly we're

00:16:58.190 --> 00:16:59.330 align:middle line:90%
in the Aquarian age where--

00:16:59.330 --> 00:17:00.090 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: We're ramping up.

00:17:00.090 --> 00:17:01.507 align:middle line:84%
>> BECVAR: --we're
moving into it.

00:17:01.507 --> 00:17:05.540 align:middle line:84%
And many people, hopefully you
and me and many of the people

00:17:05.540 --> 00:17:08.779 align:middle line:84%
that are watching this program
are feeling it and are open--

00:17:08.779 --> 00:17:09.079 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Yeah, excited.

00:17:09.079 --> 00:17:10.412 align:middle line:90%
>> BECVAR: --to that transition.

00:17:10.412 --> 00:17:11.339 align:middle line:90%
Excited, yeah.

00:17:11.339 --> 00:17:14.569 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: I mean, for me, that
pendulum of time that swings

00:17:14.569 --> 00:17:19.829 align:middle line:84%
back and forth, it obviously
correct, it's sort of natural.

00:17:19.829 --> 00:17:23.280 align:middle line:84%
It has turned into a very
rapidly moving wrecking ball.

00:17:23.280 --> 00:17:24.217 align:middle line:90%
And I love it.

00:17:24.217 --> 00:17:26.800 align:middle line:84%
>> BECVAR: Well, there's another
really important point I just

00:17:26.800 --> 00:17:29.150 align:middle line:84%
want to make about this
precession of the equinoxes,

00:17:29.150 --> 00:17:32.380 align:middle line:84%
because in the Vedic tradition,
there are these Yugas or these

00:17:32.380 --> 00:17:33.890 align:middle line:90%
great spans of time.

00:17:33.890 --> 00:17:37.510 align:middle line:84%
The whole cycle of precession
takes about 26,000 years

00:17:37.510 --> 00:17:40.510 align:middle line:84%
for that precessional movement
all the way through all

00:17:40.510 --> 00:17:42.460 align:middle line:90%
the constellations.

00:17:42.460 --> 00:17:46.300 align:middle line:84%
In the Vedic tradition, it said
that there is a declining period

00:17:46.300 --> 00:17:49.280 align:middle line:84%
of half of that, maybe
13,000 years or so.

00:17:49.280 --> 00:17:52.100 align:middle line:84%
When consciousness
becomes more and more dim,

00:17:52.100 --> 00:17:55.040 align:middle line:84%
we go from the Satya
Yuga, the golden age,

00:17:55.040 --> 00:17:59.600 align:middle line:84%
into Treta Yuga, the silver
age into to Dvapara Yuga,

00:17:59.600 --> 00:18:03.650 align:middle line:84%
the bronze age, and eventually,
into Kali Yuga, the lead age.

00:18:03.650 --> 00:18:05.560 align:middle line:90%
And we have come out of that.

00:18:05.560 --> 00:18:08.178 align:middle line:84%
Like in the 1600s, we've begun
to come out of Kali Yuga.

00:18:08.178 --> 00:18:09.220 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: The Kali Yuga.

00:18:09.220 --> 00:18:11.213 align:middle line:84%
>> BECVAR: Yeah, it
was such a dark time.

00:18:11.213 --> 00:18:12.380 align:middle line:90%
We won't even talk about it.

00:18:12.380 --> 00:18:13.505 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Yeah, let's not.

00:18:13.505 --> 00:18:17.650 align:middle line:84%
>> BECVAR: But we're now in the
upward moving period of Dvapara

00:18:17.650 --> 00:18:21.730 align:middle line:84%
Yuga, which is reflected in all
the technological developments.

00:18:21.730 --> 00:18:25.630 align:middle line:84%
It's rapid technological
advancement.

00:18:25.630 --> 00:18:28.920 align:middle line:84%
However, consciousness
hasn't quite

00:18:28.920 --> 00:18:32.110 align:middle line:84%
caught up to the
technological advancement.

00:18:32.110 --> 00:18:34.170 align:middle line:90%
I'm sure you'll agree.

00:18:34.170 --> 00:18:38.365 align:middle line:84%
It will if we can hang on
long enough to get there.

00:18:38.365 --> 00:18:39.165 align:middle line:90%
People are--

00:18:39.165 --> 00:18:40.010 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Be wise.

00:18:40.010 --> 00:18:40.690 align:middle line:90%
>> BECVAR: Be wise.

00:18:40.690 --> 00:18:42.940 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: Try to find some
wisdom in that transition.

00:18:42.940 --> 00:18:46.980 align:middle line:84%
Or in merging with the
technology in a way that's

00:18:46.980 --> 00:18:49.690 align:middle line:84%
useful to humans, rather
than us being useful to it.

00:18:49.690 --> 00:18:52.587 align:middle line:90%
>> BECVAR: Yeah, exactly.

00:18:52.587 --> 00:18:53.920 align:middle line:90%
There's a lot to say about that.

00:18:53.920 --> 00:18:56.685 align:middle line:84%
But anyway, I'm mentioning
this because it gives me

00:18:56.685 --> 00:18:58.840 align:middle line:84%
hope, the fact that we're
in this ascending period.

00:18:58.840 --> 00:19:00.007 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Yeah, absolutely.

00:19:00.007 --> 00:19:01.690 align:middle line:84%
>> BECVAR: And it
will get better.

00:19:01.690 --> 00:19:06.550 align:middle line:84%
It's slow, it only moves
one degree every 72 years.

00:19:06.550 --> 00:19:08.470 align:middle line:90%
So it's not like we're--

00:19:08.470 --> 00:19:11.050 align:middle line:84%
but we're in a better
period than we were--

00:19:11.050 --> 00:19:11.075 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: We are
in the up-swing.

00:19:11.075 --> 00:19:12.617 align:middle line:84%
The point is the
lights are coming on

00:19:12.617 --> 00:19:15.490 align:middle line:90%
rather than dimming further.

00:19:15.490 --> 00:19:19.510 align:middle line:84%
So let's just take your
own chart, for example.

00:19:19.510 --> 00:19:24.230 align:middle line:84%
And since the rising is such a
critical key component of it,

00:19:24.230 --> 00:19:27.650 align:middle line:84%
I guess the center of it, what
happened in your old chart

00:19:27.650 --> 00:19:30.670 align:middle line:84%
then to your new chart that you
started identifying in yourself

00:19:30.670 --> 00:19:34.215 align:middle line:84%
and feeling like, yeah, this
coat's kind of fitting me now.

00:19:34.215 --> 00:19:36.470 align:middle line:84%
>> BECVAR: Well, that's
a great question.

00:19:36.470 --> 00:19:39.790 align:middle line:84%
I think the real
light went on for me

00:19:39.790 --> 00:19:41.930 align:middle line:84%
when I realized in
the Vedic system

00:19:41.930 --> 00:19:44.780 align:middle line:84%
I was Libra rising rather
than Scorpio rising.

00:19:44.780 --> 00:19:49.630 align:middle line:84%
I never really related
to the Scorpio archetype.

00:19:49.630 --> 00:19:51.350 align:middle line:84%
I mean, it's a
powerful archetype.

00:19:51.350 --> 00:19:53.950 align:middle line:84%
And I have many clients
with Scorpio ascendant

00:19:53.950 --> 00:19:55.630 align:middle line:90%
and they're powerful.

00:19:55.630 --> 00:19:57.470 align:middle line:90%
But it just didn't fit me.

00:19:57.470 --> 00:20:01.095 align:middle line:84%
The Libra ascendant
fit me like a glove.

00:20:01.095 --> 00:20:02.450 align:middle line:90%
I'm much more relational.

00:20:02.450 --> 00:20:03.450 align:middle line:90%
I'm much more Venusian.

00:20:03.450 --> 00:20:04.250 align:middle line:90%
I'm an artist.

00:20:04.250 --> 00:20:05.630 align:middle line:90%
I'm a musician.

00:20:05.630 --> 00:20:08.240 align:middle line:90%
I'm interested in harmony.

00:20:08.240 --> 00:20:10.300 align:middle line:84%
And so all the other
planetary positions

00:20:10.300 --> 00:20:15.890 align:middle line:84%
began to shift as a result.
Libra is ruled by Venus.

00:20:15.890 --> 00:20:18.852 align:middle line:84%
And in my chart, Venus
is in the ninth house,

00:20:18.852 --> 00:20:20.810 align:middle line:84%
just like in your chart,
your ascendant ruler's

00:20:20.810 --> 00:20:22.070 align:middle line:90%
in the ninth house.

00:20:22.070 --> 00:20:25.910 align:middle line:84%
This gives me and will give
a person with that all things

00:20:25.910 --> 00:20:28.940 align:middle line:84%
being equal, a lifelong love
of knowledge and pursuit

00:20:28.940 --> 00:20:30.030 align:middle line:90%
of knowledge.

00:20:30.030 --> 00:20:34.160 align:middle line:84%
And it's the ninth
house of the house

00:20:34.160 --> 00:20:38.360 align:middle line:84%
of dharma, which means, as
I said before, the way we

00:20:38.360 --> 00:20:41.720 align:middle line:84%
seek to align with our own
nature and with natural law.

00:20:41.720 --> 00:20:49.190 align:middle line:84%
This also fit me completely very
different from my Western chart

00:20:49.190 --> 00:20:51.690 align:middle line:84%
and other things
in the horoscope.

00:20:51.690 --> 00:20:54.120 align:middle line:84%
I had Jupiter in the
fourth house, for example.

00:20:54.120 --> 00:20:56.390 align:middle line:84%
Jupiter is the great
benefic planet referred

00:20:56.390 --> 00:20:59.370 align:middle line:84%
to in Sanskrit as guru,
means remover of ignorance,

00:20:59.370 --> 00:21:00.270 align:middle line:90%
remover of darkness.

00:21:00.270 --> 00:21:04.250 align:middle line:84%
So Jupiter is the planet that
draws us toward consciousness.

00:21:04.250 --> 00:21:07.905 align:middle line:84%
And I have Jupiter in
the fourth house, which

00:21:07.905 --> 00:21:09.030 align:middle line:90%
is the house of the mother.

00:21:09.030 --> 00:21:11.870 align:middle line:84%
For one thing, I had a
very spiritual mother,

00:21:11.870 --> 00:21:13.680 align:middle line:90%
a wonderful, conscious mother.

00:21:13.680 --> 00:21:16.950 align:middle line:84%
And I've always had
nice places to live.

00:21:16.950 --> 00:21:19.830 align:middle line:84%
Fourth house has a lot
to do with home and land.

00:21:19.830 --> 00:21:25.040 align:middle line:84%
And I've been very fortunate in
my home life, residential life.

00:21:25.040 --> 00:21:27.980 align:middle line:84%
I have challenges in my
chart like everybody.

00:21:27.980 --> 00:21:32.570 align:middle line:84%
Mars and Saturn are somewhere
and everybody's horoscope.

00:21:32.570 --> 00:21:36.680 align:middle line:84%
As I said, they have
their positive reflections

00:21:36.680 --> 00:21:38.420 align:middle line:90%
and their challenges.

00:21:38.420 --> 00:21:40.475 align:middle line:84%
So I could see that
in my chart as well.

00:21:40.475 --> 00:21:42.350 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: So generally,
you're seeing your--

00:21:42.350 --> 00:21:44.270 align:middle line:84%
>> BECVAR: Some of my childhood
experiences were really

00:21:44.270 --> 00:21:46.070 align:middle line:84%
reflected in the
Vedic chart, yeah.

00:21:46.070 --> 00:21:50.150 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: So in general, your
life as it expresses itself now

00:21:50.150 --> 00:21:52.880 align:middle line:84%
is a direct reflection of what
your Vedic chart would say?

00:21:52.880 --> 00:21:55.380 align:middle line:84%
>> BECVAR: I love it that you
said that, Regina, reflection.

00:21:55.380 --> 00:21:57.740 align:middle line:84%
Because that's often
what I think of the Vedic

00:21:57.740 --> 00:21:59.480 align:middle line:90%
chart as being as like a mirror.

00:21:59.480 --> 00:22:01.820 align:middle line:84%
It's called a
Darpana in Sanskrit.

00:22:01.820 --> 00:22:04.950 align:middle line:84%
And in a therapeutic
environment,

00:22:04.950 --> 00:22:08.840 align:middle line:84%
I can hold up a chart
to someone and say,

00:22:08.840 --> 00:22:12.180 align:middle line:84%
and I can point to all the
talents, gifts, and abilities.

00:22:12.180 --> 00:22:15.030 align:middle line:84%
I can point to some of the blind
spots, some of the challenges.

00:22:15.030 --> 00:22:17.490 align:middle line:90%
And people they start to relax.

00:22:17.490 --> 00:22:21.970 align:middle line:84%
Because they get it, they
feel like, yes, this is me.

00:22:21.970 --> 00:22:26.250 align:middle line:84%
Not only that, but
they feel that they

00:22:26.250 --> 00:22:28.420 align:middle line:84%
can trust me because I'm
not going to judge them.

00:22:28.420 --> 00:22:32.130 align:middle line:84%
I'm not there to tell them
they should be something other

00:22:32.130 --> 00:22:33.070 align:middle line:90%
than they are.

00:22:33.070 --> 00:22:36.450 align:middle line:84%
We all have our karma,
we all have our road

00:22:36.450 --> 00:22:39.900 align:middle line:90%
to run, our path in this life.

00:22:39.900 --> 00:22:43.860 align:middle line:84%
So I think that's the first
step in utilizing this

00:22:43.860 --> 00:22:46.890 align:middle line:84%
in a therapeutic environment,
is to put people at ease

00:22:46.890 --> 00:22:49.840 align:middle line:84%
and give them an
ability to be open.

00:22:49.840 --> 00:22:51.840 align:middle line:84%
And then I can
hopefully offer them

00:22:51.840 --> 00:22:54.628 align:middle line:84%
some healthy tools
and techniques

00:22:54.628 --> 00:22:55.670 align:middle line:90%
from the Vedic tradition.

00:22:55.670 --> 00:22:57.295 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: Well, I
have to say, I mean,

00:22:57.295 --> 00:22:59.200 align:middle line:84%
when I first encountered
Vedic astrology--

00:22:59.200 --> 00:23:01.090 align:middle line:90%
I'm not deep into astrology.

00:23:01.090 --> 00:23:01.930 align:middle line:90%
I'm a dilettante.

00:23:01.930 --> 00:23:05.100 align:middle line:84%
I have to be, in a sense, I
can't know all these subjects

00:23:05.100 --> 00:23:06.402 align:middle line:90%
with that amount of depth.

00:23:06.402 --> 00:23:08.110 align:middle line:84%
So I kind of play with
them a little bit,

00:23:08.110 --> 00:23:09.670 align:middle line:84%
and then I'm on to
the next subject.

00:23:09.670 --> 00:23:11.560 align:middle line:90%
So right up front, dilettante.

00:23:11.560 --> 00:23:15.340 align:middle line:84%
But one thing I never really
related very strongly to

00:23:15.340 --> 00:23:19.430 align:middle line:84%
was my son and my
Venus in Scorpio.

00:23:19.430 --> 00:23:21.280 align:middle line:84%
It didn't feel
like my personality

00:23:21.280 --> 00:23:23.060 align:middle line:90%
or like I go along in the world.

00:23:23.060 --> 00:23:24.920 align:middle line:84%
Then when I found
Vedic astrology,

00:23:24.920 --> 00:23:26.920 align:middle line:90%
I realized those are in Libra.

00:23:26.920 --> 00:23:28.670 align:middle line:90%
And that's how I live.

00:23:28.670 --> 00:23:31.280 align:middle line:84%
That's my life is
living like that.

00:23:31.280 --> 00:23:34.340 align:middle line:84%
And I thought, same as
you, that's all I knew.

00:23:34.340 --> 00:23:35.450 align:middle line:90%
I didn't know any more.

00:23:35.450 --> 00:23:38.050 align:middle line:84%
Just that it was a better
fitting suit or sweater.

00:23:38.050 --> 00:23:41.470 align:middle line:84%
>> BECVAR: This makes total
sense as I get to know you.

00:23:41.470 --> 00:23:45.200 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: Where the
Scorpio remains in mercury.

00:23:45.200 --> 00:23:49.090 align:middle line:84%
My mercury remains in Scorpio,
which is that kind of my mind,

00:23:49.090 --> 00:23:50.065 align:middle line:90%
going after things.

00:23:50.065 --> 00:23:52.690 align:middle line:84%
>> BECVAR: Now, see, that's very
interesting because Scorpio is

00:23:52.690 --> 00:23:55.500 align:middle line:84%
the eighth constellation or the
eighth house from your rising

00:23:55.500 --> 00:23:56.300 align:middle line:90%
sign.

00:23:56.300 --> 00:23:58.930 align:middle line:84%
And so you like to go into
the mystery to find the truth.

00:23:58.930 --> 00:24:00.013 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Oh, absolutely.

00:24:00.013 --> 00:24:02.470 align:middle line:84%
>> BECVAR: You're all about
metaphysics or esoteric

00:24:02.470 --> 00:24:02.895 align:middle line:90%
subjects.

00:24:02.895 --> 00:24:03.550 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: I have been
for many, many times.

00:24:03.550 --> 00:24:05.660 align:middle line:84%
>> BECVAR: And you've got
a great mind for that.

00:24:05.660 --> 00:24:08.320 align:middle line:84%
You can carry a lot of
details about these things

00:24:08.320 --> 00:24:09.830 align:middle line:90%
and communicate those details.

00:24:09.830 --> 00:24:10.705 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Thank you.

00:24:10.705 --> 00:24:11.750 align:middle line:90%
And so that made sense.

00:24:11.750 --> 00:24:15.000 align:middle line:84%
I thought that still remains in
Scorpio, and that makes sense.

00:24:15.000 --> 00:24:18.320 align:middle line:84%
So my personal little
ill fitting suit,

00:24:18.320 --> 00:24:20.570 align:middle line:84%
it did fit better when I
moved it over to look at it

00:24:20.570 --> 00:24:22.030 align:middle line:90%
through the Vedic lens.

00:24:22.030 --> 00:24:24.660 align:middle line:84%
>> BECVAR: Even the moon in your
chart, not to go on too much,

00:24:24.660 --> 00:24:24.710 align:middle line:90%
but--

00:24:24.710 --> 00:24:25.850 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Where is my moon?

00:24:25.850 --> 00:24:26.815 align:middle line:84%
>> BECVAR: Moon's
in the 10th house.

00:24:26.815 --> 00:24:27.410 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: But what is--

00:24:27.410 --> 00:24:28.180 align:middle line:90%
>> BECVAR: House of career.

00:24:28.180 --> 00:24:29.147 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Oh, OK.

00:24:29.147 --> 00:24:30.480 align:middle line:90%
>> BECVAR: Moon, it's Capricorn.

00:24:30.480 --> 00:24:34.970 align:middle line:84%
But it's the 10th house
is the mid-heaven.

00:24:34.970 --> 00:24:38.760 align:middle line:84%
In the chart, it's how we
contribute to the community.

00:24:38.760 --> 00:24:42.170 align:middle line:84%
And you're born on a waxing
moon, a bright-ish moon.

00:24:42.170 --> 00:24:44.010 align:middle line:90%
You're in the public eye.

00:24:44.010 --> 00:24:47.070 align:middle line:90%
You're seen, you're visible.

00:24:47.070 --> 00:24:48.112 align:middle line:90%
It's really perfect for--

00:24:48.112 --> 00:24:48.912 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Is it?

00:24:48.912 --> 00:24:50.010 align:middle line:90%
For what I'm doing?

00:24:50.010 --> 00:24:51.080 align:middle line:84%
>> BECVAR: For what
you're doing, yeah,

00:24:51.080 --> 00:24:52.180 align:middle line:90%
many things are perfect.

00:24:52.180 --> 00:24:54.347 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: It looks like
at least I've got that part

00:24:54.347 --> 00:24:55.682 align:middle line:90%
of my life right.

00:24:55.682 --> 00:24:59.030 align:middle line:84%
So Let's go forward
then into what we just

00:24:59.030 --> 00:25:00.720 align:middle line:90%
touched on it a little bit ago.

00:25:00.720 --> 00:25:02.810 align:middle line:90%
And that is--

00:25:02.810 --> 00:25:05.330 align:middle line:84%
I want to get this one of
the key periods, the Dasha

00:25:05.330 --> 00:25:09.660 align:middle line:84%
or the karmic environment of
one's life from birth to death.

00:25:09.660 --> 00:25:11.220 align:middle line:90%
I thought that was fascinating.

00:25:11.220 --> 00:25:12.330 align:middle line:90%
Tell us more about that.

00:25:12.330 --> 00:25:14.330 align:middle line:84%
>> BECVAR: Yeah, that's
a really important point

00:25:14.330 --> 00:25:16.540 align:middle line:84%
in distinguishing Vedic
astrology from Western

00:25:16.540 --> 00:25:17.340 align:middle line:90%
astrology.

00:25:17.340 --> 00:25:19.048 align:middle line:84%
And by the way, I did
want to say I'm not

00:25:19.048 --> 00:25:20.790 align:middle line:90%
disparaging Western astrology.

00:25:20.790 --> 00:25:23.050 align:middle line:84%
As I said, I know many
people are drawn to it,

00:25:23.050 --> 00:25:24.800 align:middle line:84%
and I'm compassionate
toward those people.

00:25:24.800 --> 00:25:26.750 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: It's more prominent
in the Western culture right

00:25:26.750 --> 00:25:26.940 align:middle line:90%
now.

00:25:26.940 --> 00:25:28.850 align:middle line:84%
>> BECVAR: It's what
we're accustomed to.

00:25:28.850 --> 00:25:30.140 align:middle line:90%
However, it would be good--

00:25:30.140 --> 00:25:32.307 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: It's in the
newspaper, for heaven's sake.

00:25:32.307 --> 00:25:36.650 align:middle line:84%
>> BECVAR: If they would begin
to realize that the sidereal

00:25:36.650 --> 00:25:38.670 align:middle line:84%
positions are actually
the accurate ones,

00:25:38.670 --> 00:25:41.720 align:middle line:84%
and with every passing day, the
tropical positions become less

00:25:41.720 --> 00:25:43.800 align:middle line:90%
and less so.

00:25:43.800 --> 00:25:47.610 align:middle line:84%
But anyway, this Dasha, these
Dashas, these planetary periods,

00:25:47.610 --> 00:25:49.550 align:middle line:84%
each of us goes through
a sequence or series

00:25:49.550 --> 00:25:51.467 align:middle line:84%
of these planetary periods
from the time we're

00:25:51.467 --> 00:25:52.970 align:middle line:90%
born until we leave the body.

00:25:52.970 --> 00:25:54.620 align:middle line:84%
These are determined
for each of us

00:25:54.620 --> 00:25:56.940 align:middle line:84%
by the position of the
moon when we're born.

00:25:56.940 --> 00:25:59.660 align:middle line:84%
And there's more to
explain about that.

00:25:59.660 --> 00:26:02.460 align:middle line:84%
Some of these periods
are quite long,

00:26:02.460 --> 00:26:04.770 align:middle line:84%
like the Venus
periods, 20 years long.

00:26:04.770 --> 00:26:07.405 align:middle line:84%
Some are short, like the
sun periods only six years.

00:26:07.405 --> 00:26:09.990 align:middle line:90%


00:26:09.990 --> 00:26:13.260 align:middle line:84%
These Dasha periods
are mysterious

00:26:13.260 --> 00:26:15.630 align:middle line:84%
because we don't
really know how they

00:26:15.630 --> 00:26:17.470 align:middle line:90%
were determined in the past.

00:26:17.470 --> 00:26:25.170 align:middle line:84%
Vedic astrology really came down
from a much older tradition,

00:26:25.170 --> 00:26:27.250 align:middle line:90%
before things were written down.

00:26:27.250 --> 00:26:29.770 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: I don't know what
your thoughts on all this are,

00:26:29.770 --> 00:26:32.203 align:middle line:84%
but did they come down
from a lost continent time?

00:26:32.203 --> 00:26:33.120 align:middle line:90%
>> BECVAR: I think so.

00:26:33.120 --> 00:26:34.980 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: From Atlantean
times past down.

00:26:34.980 --> 00:26:39.230 align:middle line:84%
>> BECVAR: Pre-diluvian culture,
we've had many exalted cultures

00:26:39.230 --> 00:26:40.030 align:middle line:90%
on this planet.

00:26:40.030 --> 00:26:40.895 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Yes.

00:26:40.895 --> 00:26:43.120 align:middle line:90%
>> BECVAR: Yes, I believe so.

00:26:43.120 --> 00:26:46.747 align:middle line:84%
And some people--
well, anyway, we

00:26:46.747 --> 00:26:48.830 align:middle line:84%
could launch off into the
extra terrestrial stuff.

00:26:48.830 --> 00:26:51.122 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: I think people
watching this are comfortable

00:26:51.122 --> 00:26:54.430 align:middle line:84%
with the notion that it came
from pre-diluvian times.

00:26:54.430 --> 00:26:59.230 align:middle line:84%
>> BECVAR: Yeah, a higher
culture, but it works.

00:26:59.230 --> 00:27:01.570 align:middle line:84%
All I can say is
these Dashas work.

00:27:01.570 --> 00:27:05.730 align:middle line:84%
And for example, when you change
major periods in your life

00:27:05.730 --> 00:27:08.210 align:middle line:84%
as you've done, actually
not that long ago--

00:27:08.210 --> 00:27:09.200 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Thank god.

00:27:09.200 --> 00:27:10.422 align:middle line:90%
>> BECVAR: Fortunately, yeah.

00:27:10.422 --> 00:27:12.880 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: I feel like I just
came out of one of those meat

00:27:12.880 --> 00:27:13.320 align:middle line:90%
grinders.

00:27:13.320 --> 00:27:15.108 align:middle line:84%
>> BECVAR: You
really did, my dear.

00:27:15.108 --> 00:27:17.150 align:middle line:84%
You came through, as I
think I've told you, one--

00:27:17.150 --> 00:27:17.260 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Seven years.

00:27:17.260 --> 00:27:19.540 align:middle line:84%
>> BECVAR: --of the worst
periods that we go through

00:27:19.540 --> 00:27:20.928 align:middle line:90%
in terms of the Vedic chart.

00:27:20.928 --> 00:27:22.220 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Yeah, it wasn't fun.

00:27:22.220 --> 00:27:24.012 align:middle line:84%
>> BECVAR: Transit of
Saturn over the moon.

00:27:24.012 --> 00:27:25.780 align:middle line:90%
It's rough.

00:27:25.780 --> 00:27:28.970 align:middle line:84%
Anyway, I'm glad we're
meeting on the other side.

00:27:28.970 --> 00:27:34.070 align:middle line:84%
But anyway, these Dasha
periods, they reflect,

00:27:34.070 --> 00:27:37.340 align:middle line:84%
I often say, like the karmic
environment of our lives.

00:27:37.340 --> 00:27:41.750 align:middle line:84%
So it depends what
period you're running.

00:27:41.750 --> 00:27:44.530 align:middle line:84%
How that planet is
conditioned in the chart.

00:27:44.530 --> 00:27:45.590 align:middle line:90%
Is it's strong?

00:27:45.590 --> 00:27:49.350 align:middle line:84%
What houses and what aspects
are there on that planet?

00:27:49.350 --> 00:27:52.110 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: So we talked a
little about the dharma already.

00:27:52.110 --> 00:27:53.360 align:middle line:90%
That's one of the four, right?

00:27:53.360 --> 00:27:54.940 align:middle line:84%
>> BECVAR: One of the
four aims of life.

00:27:54.940 --> 00:27:56.148 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Four aims of life.

00:27:56.148 --> 00:27:56.948 align:middle line:90%
OK, so continue on.

00:27:56.948 --> 00:27:58.948 align:middle line:84%
>> BECVAR: Yeah, thank
you for bringing that up.

00:27:58.948 --> 00:28:00.790 align:middle line:84%
Because each of the
houses in the chart

00:28:00.790 --> 00:28:03.860 align:middle line:84%
relate to one of those
four Purusharthas

00:28:03.860 --> 00:28:06.910 align:middle line:84%
or there's four aims of
life, which are dharma,

00:28:06.910 --> 00:28:10.990 align:middle line:84%
artha, which is our material
resources that we seek in order

00:28:10.990 --> 00:28:14.540 align:middle line:84%
to survive and hopefully
thrive and live our purpose,

00:28:14.540 --> 00:28:15.940 align:middle line:90%
so material things.

00:28:15.940 --> 00:28:19.880 align:middle line:84%
Kama, as in kama sutra,
which means pleasure.

00:28:19.880 --> 00:28:22.520 align:middle line:84%
When we have our basic
resources in place,

00:28:22.520 --> 00:28:24.140 align:middle line:90%
we want to expand our enjoyment.

00:28:24.140 --> 00:28:26.630 align:middle line:84%
We look for relationships
to share pleasure.

00:28:26.630 --> 00:28:30.410 align:middle line:84%
So karma is a lot about
our psychological values,

00:28:30.410 --> 00:28:33.470 align:middle line:84%
like artha is about
our economic values,

00:28:33.470 --> 00:28:35.330 align:middle line:84%
dharma is about
our moral values.

00:28:35.330 --> 00:28:38.600 align:middle line:84%
And the fourth is moksha,
liberation, self-realization,

00:28:38.600 --> 00:28:40.030 align:middle line:90%
our spiritual values.

00:28:40.030 --> 00:28:43.390 align:middle line:84%
So in every moment of our
lives, one of these desires

00:28:43.390 --> 00:28:44.217 align:middle line:90%
is prominent.

00:28:44.217 --> 00:28:45.300 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: More prominent.

00:28:45.300 --> 00:28:50.160 align:middle line:84%
>> BECVAR: But they're all
functioning all the time

00:28:50.160 --> 00:28:50.960 align:middle line:90%
in our lives.

00:28:50.960 --> 00:28:55.120 align:middle line:84%
It's just a brilliant
and enlightened approach

00:28:55.120 --> 00:28:59.630 align:middle line:84%
to human life and how to
observe ourselves in our lives.

00:28:59.630 --> 00:29:01.970 align:middle line:84%
What's motivating us
in terms of desire?

00:29:01.970 --> 00:29:04.903 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: And your chart shows
which one is dominant at that

00:29:04.903 --> 00:29:05.070 align:middle line:90%
given time?

00:29:05.070 --> 00:29:06.403 align:middle line:90%
>> BECVAR: That's exactly right.

00:29:06.403 --> 00:29:08.820 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: Like if you're
in a monetary period,

00:29:08.820 --> 00:29:11.450 align:middle line:84%
an economic period of
settling and developing

00:29:11.450 --> 00:29:14.704 align:middle line:84%
your understanding of economy
and life, for example,

00:29:14.704 --> 00:29:15.504 align:middle line:90%
that would be--

00:29:15.504 --> 00:29:17.310 align:middle line:84%
>> BECVAR: That
would play into it.

00:29:17.310 --> 00:29:21.870 align:middle line:84%
I think more relevant would
be your basic birth chart.

00:29:21.870 --> 00:29:24.825 align:middle line:84%
And what are the strong
indications in the birth chart?

00:29:24.825 --> 00:29:26.700 align:middle line:84%
Like I was saying in
your chart and my chart,

00:29:26.700 --> 00:29:30.130 align:middle line:90%
the dharma is really important.

00:29:30.130 --> 00:29:32.280 align:middle line:84%
And I think when we're
in alignment with dharma,

00:29:32.280 --> 00:29:34.320 align:middle line:84%
we attract appropriate
relationships.

00:29:34.320 --> 00:29:36.470 align:middle line:84%
We attract
appropriate resources.

00:29:36.470 --> 00:29:38.900 align:middle line:84%
We're not feeling like
something's missing and looking

00:29:38.900 --> 00:29:43.460 align:middle line:84%
for something outside of that,
and which can give rise to greed

00:29:43.460 --> 00:29:46.250 align:middle line:84%
and avarice or give
rise to addiction

00:29:46.250 --> 00:29:49.295 align:middle line:90%
in terms of the kama principle.

00:29:49.295 --> 00:29:51.000 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Let me understand.

00:29:51.000 --> 00:29:54.030 align:middle line:84%
So I'm understanding that all
of these, the moral values,

00:29:54.030 --> 00:29:56.330 align:middle line:84%
economic values, psychological
values, spiritual values

00:29:56.330 --> 00:29:58.500 align:middle line:90%
are all playing in our chart.

00:29:58.500 --> 00:30:00.390 align:middle line:90%
They're playing all the time.

00:30:00.390 --> 00:30:04.600 align:middle line:84%
But depending on our
birth and our rising sign,

00:30:04.600 --> 00:30:07.080 align:middle line:84%
one of those areas
is probably going

00:30:07.080 --> 00:30:10.685 align:middle line:84%
to be most prominent as an
over-story of our lives.

00:30:10.685 --> 00:30:14.160 align:middle line:84%
>> BECVAR: Yes, I don't want
to make it too simplistic

00:30:14.160 --> 00:30:15.630 align:middle line:84%
because all four
will be reflected.

00:30:15.630 --> 00:30:17.172 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: That's
all I'm capable of.

00:30:17.172 --> 00:30:20.070 align:middle line:84%
>> BECVAR: No, your
questions are really good.

00:30:20.070 --> 00:30:22.840 align:middle line:84%
All four are reflected
in the chart.

00:30:22.840 --> 00:30:26.790 align:middle line:84%
Some maybe at different
times as you suggested,

00:30:26.790 --> 00:30:30.348 align:middle line:84%
but it is a helpful
way to look at a chart

00:30:30.348 --> 00:30:31.890 align:middle line:84%
because we can see,
well, where do we

00:30:31.890 --> 00:30:34.770 align:middle line:90%
need to do a little attunement?

00:30:34.770 --> 00:30:38.340 align:middle line:84%
Now, everybody can benefit from
putting more attention on dharma

00:30:38.340 --> 00:30:39.610 align:middle line:90%
on their moral values.

00:30:39.610 --> 00:30:42.060 align:middle line:84%
Not moral in a
fundamentalist way, but

00:30:42.060 --> 00:30:44.800 align:middle line:84%
how can I really
align with my nature

00:30:44.800 --> 00:30:47.070 align:middle line:84%
so that I'm in alignment
with great nature

00:30:47.070 --> 00:30:49.680 align:middle line:90%
and supported by great nature?

00:30:49.680 --> 00:30:54.540 align:middle line:84%
So these are just tools that
can be used in the chart.

00:30:54.540 --> 00:30:56.688 align:middle line:90%
I don't like to be too--

00:30:56.688 --> 00:30:57.605 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: --dogmatic.

00:30:57.605 --> 00:30:58.910 align:middle line:90%
>> BECVAR: Dogmatic, exactly.

00:30:58.910 --> 00:30:59.910 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: I understand.

00:30:59.910 --> 00:31:04.065 align:middle line:84%
So now, looking at
everything through this lens,

00:31:04.065 --> 00:31:06.010 align:middle line:84%
one thing you do
is the component

00:31:06.010 --> 00:31:10.150 align:middle line:84%
of analyzing-- in your practice
and working with people,

00:31:10.150 --> 00:31:12.800 align:middle line:84%
analyzing relationship
compatibility

00:31:12.800 --> 00:31:15.310 align:middle line:84%
that you find this a
really beautiful system

00:31:15.310 --> 00:31:17.590 align:middle line:84%
to be able to give
someone a heads up.

00:31:17.590 --> 00:31:18.610 align:middle line:90%
>> BECVAR: I love it.

00:31:18.610 --> 00:31:21.920 align:middle line:84%
As a Libran, which Libras
are all about relationship,

00:31:21.920 --> 00:31:24.830 align:middle line:84%
they are all about finding
harmony, getting along,

00:31:24.830 --> 00:31:27.280 align:middle line:90%
they just want to get along.

00:31:27.280 --> 00:31:30.510 align:middle line:84%
Relationship compatibility
is interesting and important

00:31:30.510 --> 00:31:31.310 align:middle line:90%
for all of us.

00:31:31.310 --> 00:31:34.930 align:middle line:84%
We're always looking
for companionship.

00:31:34.930 --> 00:31:37.867 align:middle line:84%
I mean, if you watch
most movies on TV,

00:31:37.867 --> 00:31:40.450 align:middle line:84%
there's always that component
is really key to the melodrama--

00:31:40.450 --> 00:31:41.595 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: People want
to feel connected.

00:31:41.595 --> 00:31:43.960 align:middle line:84%
>> BECVAR: They want to
feel connected, yeah.

00:31:43.960 --> 00:31:47.710 align:middle line:84%
And finding a good
relationship can

00:31:47.710 --> 00:31:50.870 align:middle line:84%
be one of the great
joys of a human life.

00:31:50.870 --> 00:31:53.380 align:middle line:84%
I love looking at
relationship compatibility

00:31:53.380 --> 00:31:57.820 align:middle line:84%
because there are
several cornerstones that

00:31:57.820 --> 00:32:01.700 align:middle line:84%
will indicate how you're going
to get along with this person.

00:32:01.700 --> 00:32:03.790 align:middle line:90%
The first is the rising sign.

00:32:03.790 --> 00:32:07.270 align:middle line:84%
And is the other
person's rising sign

00:32:07.270 --> 00:32:12.340 align:middle line:84%
in complementary
relationship to that,

00:32:12.340 --> 00:32:15.383 align:middle line:90%
is it opposite for one thing?

00:32:15.383 --> 00:32:16.300 align:middle line:90%
That can be very good.

00:32:16.300 --> 00:32:17.200 align:middle line:90%
Or is it the same?

00:32:17.200 --> 00:32:18.190 align:middle line:90%
That can be very good.

00:32:18.190 --> 00:32:20.940 align:middle line:84%
Or is it the same or a
complementary element?

00:32:20.940 --> 00:32:22.840 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Element, right.

00:32:22.840 --> 00:32:26.200 align:middle line:84%
So in that sense, Western
astrology is similar.

00:32:26.200 --> 00:32:27.210 align:middle line:90%
>> BECVAR: Yeah.

00:32:27.210 --> 00:32:30.050 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: Say your sun and
their moon or your rising signs,

00:32:30.050 --> 00:32:30.850 align:middle line:90%
that's similar.

00:32:30.850 --> 00:32:34.070 align:middle line:84%
>> BECVAR: Right, it can be,
and it's used in that way.

00:32:34.070 --> 00:32:37.120 align:middle line:84%
And there are many useful
tools in Western astrology

00:32:37.120 --> 00:32:39.850 align:middle line:84%
that people get benefit
from, like observing

00:32:39.850 --> 00:32:42.840 align:middle line:84%
the relationships of planets
to one another, the aspects

00:32:42.840 --> 00:32:43.640 align:middle line:90%
and so on.

00:32:43.640 --> 00:32:45.860 align:middle line:84%
That's still works
in Western astrology.

00:32:45.860 --> 00:32:47.570 align:middle line:90%
It's just the tropical Zodiac.

00:32:47.570 --> 00:32:48.370 align:middle line:90%
We need to--

00:32:48.370 --> 00:32:48.850 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: Right,
right, got you.

00:32:48.850 --> 00:32:51.525 align:middle line:84%
>> BECVAR: --begin to shift
a little bit from that.

00:32:51.525 --> 00:32:54.730 align:middle line:84%
I want to make that
gentle suggestion.

00:32:54.730 --> 00:32:56.182 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: So it works that way.

00:32:56.182 --> 00:32:57.890 align:middle line:84%
So what you're talking
about rising signs

00:32:57.890 --> 00:32:59.275 align:middle line:84%
when you're looking
at compatibility.

00:32:59.275 --> 00:33:01.567 align:middle line:84%
>> BECVAR: Because the rising
sign has a lot to do with

00:33:01.567 --> 00:33:04.020 align:middle line:84%
the physical body and
how we occupy space,

00:33:04.020 --> 00:33:08.030 align:middle line:84%
so how well will I be able
to align with you in terms

00:33:08.030 --> 00:33:10.130 align:middle line:90%
of physical space?

00:33:10.130 --> 00:33:12.870 align:middle line:84%
Will there be some
complementarity there?

00:33:12.870 --> 00:33:16.190 align:middle line:84%
The moon sign is very important
in the Vedic tradition.

00:33:16.190 --> 00:33:17.960 align:middle line:84%
In India for thousands
of years, they've

00:33:17.960 --> 00:33:20.090 align:middle line:84%
arranged marriages
primarily based

00:33:20.090 --> 00:33:22.850 align:middle line:84%
on the moon signs, the
relationships of the moon signs.

00:33:22.850 --> 00:33:25.740 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: But
statistically, I mean,

00:33:25.740 --> 00:33:28.350 align:middle line:84%
it's a different culture where
you can't just easily divorce

00:33:28.350 --> 00:33:30.180 align:middle line:84%
and so forth, at
least in the past.

00:33:30.180 --> 00:33:33.630 align:middle line:84%
But statistically, if you
could even use that word,

00:33:33.630 --> 00:33:36.440 align:middle line:84%
didn't those relationships
also oftentimes have

00:33:36.440 --> 00:33:37.565 align:middle line:90%
some real staying power?

00:33:37.565 --> 00:33:41.090 align:middle line:84%
>> BECVAR: Yes, and I think part
of it is the culture really puts

00:33:41.090 --> 00:33:42.570 align:middle line:90%
a lot of importance on that.

00:33:42.570 --> 00:33:47.190 align:middle line:84%
The families get together
when somebody's--

00:33:47.190 --> 00:33:50.630 align:middle line:84%
There's a whole lot that goes
into arranging a marriage,

00:33:50.630 --> 00:33:51.720 align:middle line:90%
making a decision.

00:33:51.720 --> 00:33:54.090 align:middle line:84%
It's changed somewhat
for modern Indians.

00:33:54.090 --> 00:33:57.180 align:middle line:84%
But this idea of
utilizing the moon signs

00:33:57.180 --> 00:33:58.270 align:middle line:90%
can really be helpful.

00:33:58.270 --> 00:33:59.770 align:middle line:84%
Because the moon,
as I said earlier,

00:33:59.770 --> 00:34:01.780 align:middle line:84%
it has to do with the
manas, the intuitive mind.

00:34:01.780 --> 00:34:04.197 align:middle line:84%
And where the mind goes, that's
where the rest of us goes.

00:34:04.197 --> 00:34:08.070 align:middle line:84%
And if there's good synastry,
good harmony between the moon

00:34:08.070 --> 00:34:10.960 align:middle line:84%
signs, generally, the
communications will be good,

00:34:10.960 --> 00:34:12.510 align:middle line:90%
there'll be good empathy.

00:34:12.510 --> 00:34:16.320 align:middle line:84%
There'll be good ability
to communicate and navigate

00:34:16.320 --> 00:34:18.219 align:middle line:84%
other things that
come up in life.

00:34:18.219 --> 00:34:21.190 align:middle line:84%
But we also look at the
positions of Venus, for example.

00:34:21.190 --> 00:34:24.870 align:middle line:84%
The Venus positions have a lot
to do with the things we love

00:34:24.870 --> 00:34:27.000 align:middle line:90%
and enjoy and are attracted to.

00:34:27.000 --> 00:34:29.050 align:middle line:84%
So the Venus positions
are harmonious.

00:34:29.050 --> 00:34:31.008 align:middle line:84%
You're going to have fun
with the other person.

00:34:31.008 --> 00:34:33.360 align:middle line:84%
You're going to
feel love for them.

00:34:33.360 --> 00:34:36.870 align:middle line:84%
I often say when I see Venus
in the same sign of a couple's

00:34:36.870 --> 00:34:40.260 align:middle line:84%
charts, I just love
that because they just

00:34:40.260 --> 00:34:41.679 align:middle line:90%
feel good with each other.

00:34:41.679 --> 00:34:44.210 align:middle line:84%
They don't even know why,
they just want to snuggle up.

00:34:44.210 --> 00:34:45.010 align:middle line:90%
They fall in love.

00:34:45.010 --> 00:34:45.843 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Hang out.

00:34:45.843 --> 00:34:49.139 align:middle line:84%
>> BECVAR: Hang out, it's
a very important component.

00:34:49.139 --> 00:34:52.239 align:middle line:84%
Also, the sun signs, of
course, come into play.

00:34:52.239 --> 00:34:54.589 align:middle line:84%
And Jupiter, the position
of Jupiter-- actually,

00:34:54.589 --> 00:34:55.389 align:middle line:90%
all the planets.

00:34:55.389 --> 00:34:57.750 align:middle line:84%
But there are some
cornerstone elements

00:34:57.750 --> 00:35:00.910 align:middle line:84%
that I always look at in
compatibility analysis.

00:35:00.910 --> 00:35:04.300 align:middle line:84%
And believe me, over the 30
odd years I've been doing this,

00:35:04.300 --> 00:35:06.443 align:middle line:84%
I rarely see it that
it doesn't work.

00:35:06.443 --> 00:35:08.110 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: It doesn't
play out that way.

00:35:08.110 --> 00:35:10.210 align:middle line:84%
>> BECVAR: I mean, there are
many different combinations,

00:35:10.210 --> 00:35:10.660 align:middle line:90%
obviously.

00:35:10.660 --> 00:35:12.660 align:middle line:84%
Sometimes somebody will
be attracted to somebody

00:35:12.660 --> 00:35:15.023 align:middle line:84%
because Venus is good and
you just fall in love.

00:35:15.023 --> 00:35:16.690 align:middle line:84%
But the moon signs
might not be so good,

00:35:16.690 --> 00:35:18.670 align:middle line:84%
so their communications
might be wonky.

00:35:18.670 --> 00:35:20.945 align:middle line:84%
So that's where they need
to do some adjustments.

00:35:20.945 --> 00:35:23.310 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: Yeah, what do you
do when you're working with

00:35:23.310 --> 00:35:26.970 align:middle line:84%
a couple that's looking at their
compatibility in a chart and you

00:35:26.970 --> 00:35:29.486 align:middle line:90%
see some breathtaking obstacles.

00:35:29.486 --> 00:35:31.370 align:middle line:90%
>> BECVAR: Well, I do.

00:35:31.370 --> 00:35:32.170 align:middle line:90%
It happens.

00:35:32.170 --> 00:35:36.300 align:middle line:84%
And believe me, one very
good tool I'll tell you

00:35:36.300 --> 00:35:39.000 align:middle line:84%
right now because it's useful
for anybody and anybody could do

00:35:39.000 --> 00:35:41.790 align:middle line:84%
it even with their partner or
with the clerk in the grocery

00:35:41.790 --> 00:35:45.660 align:middle line:84%
store, is to inquire of
yourself from time to time,

00:35:45.660 --> 00:35:49.300 align:middle line:84%
in this moment, in this moment,
whatever this moment is,

00:35:49.300 --> 00:35:53.020 align:middle line:84%
what would nourishment be
like for this other person?

00:35:53.020 --> 00:35:56.193 align:middle line:84%
And just suspend your
own agenda, whatever

00:35:56.193 --> 00:35:57.610 align:middle line:84%
that is, and just
inquire, what is

00:35:57.610 --> 00:36:00.580 align:middle line:84%
nourishment like in this
moment for this other person?

00:36:00.580 --> 00:36:03.320 align:middle line:84%
And let yourself get a
little intuitive hit.

00:36:03.320 --> 00:36:06.550 align:middle line:84%
You'll get a little message
if you ask that sincerely.

00:36:06.550 --> 00:36:08.770 align:middle line:84%
You might get a
message like, well, it

00:36:08.770 --> 00:36:11.513 align:middle line:84%
might be nourishing for
this person to take a walk,

00:36:11.513 --> 00:36:13.430 align:middle line:84%
or it be nourishing for
them to watch a movie,

00:36:13.430 --> 00:36:15.260 align:middle line:84%
or it might be
nourishing for them to--

00:36:15.260 --> 00:36:16.910 align:middle line:84%
I don't know what, could
be a million things.

00:36:16.910 --> 00:36:18.660 align:middle line:84%
But the point of doing
this is that you're

00:36:18.660 --> 00:36:21.100 align:middle line:84%
putting your unconditional
positive attention

00:36:21.100 --> 00:36:22.120 align:middle line:90%
on this other person.

00:36:22.120 --> 00:36:23.203 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Mhm, Beautiful.

00:36:23.203 --> 00:36:26.900 align:middle line:84%
>> BECVAR: And they feel
it in some subtle way.

00:36:26.900 --> 00:36:28.722 align:middle line:84%
It's like, oh,
you care about me,

00:36:28.722 --> 00:36:29.930 align:middle line:90%
you want to know what I want?

00:36:29.930 --> 00:36:30.740 align:middle line:90%
Thank you.

00:36:30.740 --> 00:36:33.130 align:middle line:90%
They have to turn toward you.

00:36:33.130 --> 00:36:35.527 align:middle line:84%
I know it doesn't always--
you don't always get--

00:36:35.527 --> 00:36:37.610 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: What about when
you're kind of almost--

00:36:37.610 --> 00:36:39.193 align:middle line:84%
and I don't even
want to say neurotic,

00:36:39.193 --> 00:36:41.140 align:middle line:84%
that's not the right
word, but you're

00:36:41.140 --> 00:36:42.770 align:middle line:90%
focused too much on the other.

00:36:42.770 --> 00:36:45.130 align:middle line:84%
>> BECVAR: Yeah,
that can happen.

00:36:45.130 --> 00:36:46.560 align:middle line:90%
That can happen.

00:36:46.560 --> 00:36:50.120 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: What's is that
fine line between giving this

00:36:50.120 --> 00:36:52.670 align:middle line:84%
beautiful, positive thought
of nourishment to the other

00:36:52.670 --> 00:36:54.710 align:middle line:90%
and overdoing it?

00:36:54.710 --> 00:36:55.920 align:middle line:90%
>> BECVAR: That's so good.

00:36:55.920 --> 00:36:57.120 align:middle line:90%
Such a good question.

00:36:57.120 --> 00:37:00.630 align:middle line:84%
Well, I think you have to
ask the question at times,

00:37:00.630 --> 00:37:02.082 align:middle line:90%
are they doing this for me?

00:37:02.082 --> 00:37:04.290 align:middle line:84%
And in a good relationship,
you'll have an agreement.

00:37:04.290 --> 00:37:05.373 align:middle line:90%
You'll say, let's do this.

00:37:05.373 --> 00:37:08.220 align:middle line:84%
Let's make a game out or
experiment out of this.

00:37:08.220 --> 00:37:10.400 align:middle line:84%
I'm not going to tell
you when I'm doing it.

00:37:10.400 --> 00:37:12.750 align:middle line:84%
You don't need to tell
me when you're doing it.

00:37:12.750 --> 00:37:17.440 align:middle line:84%
Let's do it for 30 days and see
if the rapport gets a little bit

00:37:17.440 --> 00:37:18.240 align:middle line:90%
better.

00:37:18.240 --> 00:37:19.210 align:middle line:90%
I love that word, rapport.

00:37:19.210 --> 00:37:20.418 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Yeah, that's nice.

00:37:20.418 --> 00:37:24.690 align:middle line:84%
>> BECVAR: So if the other
person is not on board for this,

00:37:24.690 --> 00:37:26.550 align:middle line:84%
then there's going
to be disappointment.

00:37:26.550 --> 00:37:30.360 align:middle line:84%
You're not going to get
the reciprocal attention.

00:37:30.360 --> 00:37:33.110 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: I just want to bring
that up because a lot of people

00:37:33.110 --> 00:37:35.370 align:middle line:84%
and oftentimes
women, in particular,

00:37:35.370 --> 00:37:39.410 align:middle line:84%
but a lot of people tend to get
into that cycle of especially

00:37:39.410 --> 00:37:42.620 align:middle line:84%
if their partner is
discontented on some level,

00:37:42.620 --> 00:37:44.630 align:middle line:90%
you can't give enough.

00:37:44.630 --> 00:37:46.700 align:middle line:84%
You just keep
thinking, what else

00:37:46.700 --> 00:37:50.748 align:middle line:84%
can I do or we do to lift
this person's spirits?

00:37:50.748 --> 00:37:52.790 align:middle line:84%
And right now, because
we're in such a time where

00:37:52.790 --> 00:37:55.820 align:middle line:84%
so many spirits are down,
that's why I'm saying,

00:37:55.820 --> 00:37:57.540 align:middle line:84%
what's the demarcation
between those?

00:37:57.540 --> 00:38:00.850 align:middle line:84%
And it sounds like you said
considering self as well.

00:38:00.850 --> 00:38:02.600 align:middle line:84%
>> BECVAR: Absolutely,
consider self.

00:38:02.600 --> 00:38:07.080 align:middle line:84%
But also enroll the other
person in this situation.

00:38:07.080 --> 00:38:09.140 align:middle line:84%
And you can do it
in a diplomatic way.

00:38:09.140 --> 00:38:11.390 align:middle line:84%
You don't want to make the
other person wrong and say,

00:38:11.390 --> 00:38:13.830 align:middle line:84%
I don't feel like I'm getting
the attention from you.

00:38:13.830 --> 00:38:16.670 align:middle line:84%
Just say, let's
try an experiment.

00:38:16.670 --> 00:38:17.510 align:middle line:90%
Just as I mentioned.

00:38:17.510 --> 00:38:19.795 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: That's really
beautiful, experiment.

00:38:19.795 --> 00:38:22.520 align:middle line:84%
>> BECVAR: Or even a game,
make it a game, sure.

00:38:22.520 --> 00:38:24.050 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: OK.

00:38:24.050 --> 00:38:26.160 align:middle line:84%
There's so much, and we
have five minutes left.

00:38:26.160 --> 00:38:27.950 align:middle line:84%
So one thing you
look at in the chart

00:38:27.950 --> 00:38:31.010 align:middle line:84%
is you call remedial
work, really

00:38:31.010 --> 00:38:34.550 align:middle line:84%
how to start helping
in areas where

00:38:34.550 --> 00:38:36.530 align:middle line:84%
you can look at
areas of challenge

00:38:36.530 --> 00:38:41.270 align:middle line:84%
in a new way and some tools you
can use to help heal those areas

00:38:41.270 --> 00:38:42.180 align:middle line:90%
or refine them.

00:38:42.180 --> 00:38:42.980 align:middle line:90%
>> BECVAR: Yeah.

00:38:42.980 --> 00:38:44.400 align:middle line:90%
Yeah, important question.

00:38:44.400 --> 00:38:47.610 align:middle line:84%
And this is a big part
of the Vedic approach

00:38:47.610 --> 00:38:51.180 align:middle line:84%
to astrology, are the remedial
measures they referred to

00:38:51.180 --> 00:38:52.660 align:middle line:90%
as upanyas.

00:38:52.660 --> 00:38:56.980 align:middle line:84%
And they can be in a
therapeutic environment.

00:38:56.980 --> 00:39:02.640 align:middle line:84%
They can range from enrolling
a person to change their diet

00:39:02.640 --> 00:39:09.690 align:middle line:84%
or get more exercise or just
basic things in the direction

00:39:09.690 --> 00:39:11.200 align:middle line:90%
of health and healing.

00:39:11.200 --> 00:39:15.810 align:middle line:84%
They can also have
to do with maybe

00:39:15.810 --> 00:39:18.240 align:middle line:84%
more spiritual
things like we would

00:39:18.240 --> 00:39:19.860 align:middle line:90%
find in the yoga tradition.

00:39:19.860 --> 00:39:23.460 align:middle line:84%
Maybe learning meditation or
learning Pranayama breathing

00:39:23.460 --> 00:39:26.040 align:middle line:90%
techniques.

00:39:26.040 --> 00:39:28.240 align:middle line:84%
Meditation is so
vitally important.

00:39:28.240 --> 00:39:31.710 align:middle line:84%
I really almost with every
client I see I try to encourage

00:39:31.710 --> 00:39:36.270 align:middle line:84%
them and even guide them in a
practice because we can really

00:39:36.270 --> 00:39:40.320 align:middle line:84%
resolve so many of the issues
that we have in our lives

00:39:40.320 --> 00:39:43.690 align:middle line:84%
by becoming more self-referral
rather than object referral--

00:39:43.690 --> 00:39:43.960 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: Absolutely,
absolutely.

00:39:43.960 --> 00:39:45.550 align:middle line:84%
>> BECVAR: --as
people would say.

00:39:45.550 --> 00:39:47.860 align:middle line:84%
So learning that the
source of our being

00:39:47.860 --> 00:39:52.460 align:middle line:84%
is always present with us, and
we always have that to draw on,

00:39:52.460 --> 00:39:55.630 align:middle line:84%
and we find that we experience
that directly in meditation, it

00:39:55.630 --> 00:39:56.720 align:middle line:90%
changes everything.

00:39:56.720 --> 00:40:00.070 align:middle line:84%
It changes our
perception of the world.

00:40:00.070 --> 00:40:02.620 align:middle line:84%
But in the Vedic
tradition also, there

00:40:02.620 --> 00:40:04.880 align:middle line:90%
are many more esoteric ones.

00:40:04.880 --> 00:40:07.495 align:middle line:84%
Certainly, the use of
gemstones has been used for--

00:40:07.495 --> 00:40:08.295 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Oh, yes.

00:40:08.295 --> 00:40:10.720 align:middle line:84%
>> BECVAR: Really, much of
the original use of wearing

00:40:10.720 --> 00:40:11.520 align:middle line:90%
of gemstones.

00:40:11.520 --> 00:40:14.840 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: Oh, that bracelet
that Yogananda wore,

00:40:14.840 --> 00:40:16.520 align:middle line:84%
I've just looked at
that so many times.

00:40:16.520 --> 00:40:17.740 align:middle line:84%
>> BECVAR: Yeah,
the three metals.

00:40:17.740 --> 00:40:18.855 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: And the stones.

00:40:18.855 --> 00:40:19.790 align:middle line:90%
>> BECVAR: The stones.

00:40:19.790 --> 00:40:21.140 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: All the stones.

00:40:21.140 --> 00:40:24.310 align:middle line:84%
>> BECVAR: Yeah, because
gemstones are conductors

00:40:24.310 --> 00:40:26.150 align:middle line:90%
of electromagnetism.

00:40:26.150 --> 00:40:29.500 align:middle line:84%
And different gemstones relate
different to different planetary

00:40:29.500 --> 00:40:30.430 align:middle line:90%
archetypes.

00:40:30.430 --> 00:40:32.600 align:middle line:84%
The diamond, I wear
the diamond for Venus,

00:40:32.600 --> 00:40:34.430 align:middle line:90%
which is my ruling planet.

00:40:34.430 --> 00:40:36.890 align:middle line:10%
So that's another area.

00:40:36.890 --> 00:40:40.760 align:middle line:10%
There can also be even more
tantric ones like charity to--

00:40:40.760 --> 00:40:44.390 align:middle line:10%
well, certainly charity to
unprivileged, underprivileged

00:40:44.390 --> 00:40:46.398 align:middle line:10%
people or giving time
to children, giving--

00:40:46.398 --> 00:40:47.690 align:middle line:10%
>> REGINA: For practical means.

00:40:47.690 --> 00:40:49.565 align:middle line:10%
>> BECVAR: --attention
to elders, practical--

00:40:49.565 --> 00:40:52.250 align:middle line:10%
but also things like feeding
crows on a Saturday is a good

00:40:52.250 --> 00:40:54.230 align:middle line:10%
remedial measure for Saturn.

00:40:54.230 --> 00:40:55.333 align:middle line:90%
Saturn's day is Saturday.

00:40:55.333 --> 00:40:57.500 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: I haven't been
feeding any crows and boy,

00:40:57.500 --> 00:40:58.740 align:middle line:90%
did I have Saturn.

00:40:58.740 --> 00:40:59.540 align:middle line:90%
I wish I'd known.

00:40:59.540 --> 00:41:00.540 align:middle line:90%
>> BECVAR: Yeah, you did.

00:41:00.540 --> 00:41:01.250 align:middle line:90%
You went through Saturn.

00:41:01.250 --> 00:41:02.625 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: I
would've fed a lot--

00:41:02.625 --> 00:41:05.194 align:middle line:84%
I'd have gotten a
lot of bird seed.

00:41:05.194 --> 00:41:10.080 align:middle line:84%
>> BECVAR: Well, Saturn is the
great teacher, the lord of time,

00:41:10.080 --> 00:41:10.880 align:middle line:90%
Chronos.

00:41:10.880 --> 00:41:14.450 align:middle line:90%
So we honor Shani, Saturn.

00:41:14.450 --> 00:41:16.920 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: So we are
actually out of time,

00:41:16.920 --> 00:41:19.820 align:middle line:84%
and we got to some of what
I wanted to talk about.

00:41:19.820 --> 00:41:22.200 align:middle line:84%
And you've been wonderful
in helping us understand.

00:41:22.200 --> 00:41:24.600 align:middle line:84%
And I have to tell you
that with my permission,

00:41:24.600 --> 00:41:27.030 align:middle line:84%
I'd forgotten about
this, my producer, Julie,

00:41:27.030 --> 00:41:28.410 align:middle line:90%
had given you my chart.

00:41:28.410 --> 00:41:32.970 align:middle line:84%
And we were blown away in the
green room when you said, wow,

00:41:32.970 --> 00:41:35.480 align:middle line:84%
and you gave specific
timelines and you

00:41:35.480 --> 00:41:39.220 align:middle line:84%
didn't know anything about me or
my life right to the timelines.

00:41:39.220 --> 00:41:40.020 align:middle line:90%
It was right on.

00:41:40.020 --> 00:41:42.170 align:middle line:84%
So I have to say,
I don't think I'm

00:41:42.170 --> 00:41:44.130 align:middle line:84%
going to bother with
Western astrology.

00:41:44.130 --> 00:41:46.640 align:middle line:84%
My dilettante fooling around
with Western astrology anymore.

00:41:46.640 --> 00:41:47.970 align:middle line:90%
>> BECVAR: It's a transition.

00:41:47.970 --> 00:41:48.890 align:middle line:90%
I think many people are making.

00:41:48.890 --> 00:41:50.125 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: I think I made
the transition today.

00:41:50.125 --> 00:41:52.000 align:middle line:84%
>> BECVAR: As I said,
I'm not disparaging it,

00:41:52.000 --> 00:41:55.440 align:middle line:84%
and I have compassion for people
that are really interested.

00:41:55.440 --> 00:41:59.380 align:middle line:84%
But I want to encourage people
to look at this new possibility.

00:41:59.380 --> 00:42:02.240 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: I just found just
in that few minutes we had was

00:42:02.240 --> 00:42:04.380 align:middle line:84%
so incredibly to the
heart and accurate.

00:42:04.380 --> 00:42:05.310 align:middle line:84%
>> BECVAR: That's
what I experienced.

00:42:05.310 --> 00:42:06.143 align:middle line:90%
I never looked back.

00:42:06.143 --> 00:42:07.410 align:middle line:90%
Once I found it, that was it.

00:42:07.410 --> 00:42:09.090 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: Well, you
got a convert here,

00:42:09.090 --> 00:42:11.695 align:middle line:84%
and I think some people
here at Gaia, too.

00:42:11.695 --> 00:42:12.570 align:middle line:90%
>> BECVAR: Thank you.

00:42:12.570 --> 00:42:14.010 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: Thank you
so much for your time.

00:42:14.010 --> 00:42:14.090 align:middle line:90%
>> BECVAR: I had great pleasure.

00:42:14.090 --> 00:42:15.210 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: I really
appreciate it.

00:42:15.210 --> 00:42:16.502 align:middle line:90%
>> BECVAR: Thank you very much.

00:42:16.502 --> 00:42:18.680 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: You can find
more about Vedic astrology

00:42:18.680 --> 00:42:24.090 align:middle line:84%
and Brent's work on his site,
brentbecvar.com, B-E-C-V-A-R.

00:42:24.090 --> 00:42:26.690 align:middle line:84%
He has some lovely videos
explaining the principles

00:42:26.690 --> 00:42:27.810 align:middle line:90%
we've been discussing.

00:42:27.810 --> 00:42:30.480 align:middle line:84%
You can also schedule an
astrological reading from him.

00:42:30.480 --> 00:42:33.860 align:middle line:84%
Until next time, thank you for
