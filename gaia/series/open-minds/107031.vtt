00:00:27.961 --> 00:00:30.460 align:middle line:10%
>>REGINA MEREDITH: In my last
conversation with Jerry Wills,

00:00:30.460 --> 00:00:33.620 align:middle line:10%
we talked about how he was
recruited to be an evangelist

00:00:33.620 --> 00:00:35.730 align:middle line:10%
tent healer at the age of 19.

00:00:35.730 --> 00:00:36.600 align:middle line:90%
He refused.

00:00:36.600 --> 00:00:39.950 align:middle line:84%
But sometimes, we just
can't cheat our fate.

00:00:39.950 --> 00:00:42.750 align:middle line:84%
When Jerry goes to
conferences and does his work,

00:00:42.750 --> 00:00:45.430 align:middle line:84%
people have literally been able
to throw away the crutches,

00:00:45.430 --> 00:00:47.620 align:middle line:84%
the blind have been
able to see new colors,

00:00:47.620 --> 00:00:49.100 align:middle line:90%
and tumors disappear.

00:00:49.100 --> 00:00:52.290 align:middle line:84%
Today, we talk about the
essence of our own abilities

00:00:52.290 --> 00:00:53.850 align:middle line:90%
to heal as human beings.

00:00:53.850 --> 00:00:55.800 align:middle line:84%
And that's really
the crux of it.

00:00:55.800 --> 00:00:58.430 align:middle line:84%
In the last conversation, we
opened it up a little bit,

00:00:58.430 --> 00:01:00.610 align:middle line:84%
and people love to
hear the stories,

00:01:00.610 --> 00:01:03.780 align:middle line:84%
because it gives us a
sense of what's possible.

00:01:03.780 --> 00:01:07.090 align:middle line:84%
It's not magic, it's
what's possible.

00:01:07.090 --> 00:01:08.820 align:middle line:84%
So I'm doing something
with you that I

00:01:08.820 --> 00:01:10.099 align:middle line:90%
haven't done before in a show.

00:01:10.099 --> 00:01:11.140 align:middle line:90%
>>JERRY WILLS: All right.

00:01:11.140 --> 00:01:14.890 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: You know how on
the page that the show is

00:01:14.890 --> 00:01:18.080 align:middle line:84%
featured on Gaiam, right, there
are all these comments below.

00:01:18.080 --> 00:01:20.430 align:middle line:84%
And here are the first
six hours, 12 hours.

00:01:20.430 --> 00:01:23.140 align:middle line:84%
We're watching all the comments
come in, everybody on the team.

00:01:23.140 --> 00:01:26.880 align:middle line:84%
And people were, oh, I
just love Jerry Wills.

00:01:26.880 --> 00:01:30.040 align:middle line:84%
His whole being makes me
feel so calm and on and on.

00:01:30.040 --> 00:01:33.014 align:middle line:84%
Then a little bit later, we got
a couple other kinds of emails,

00:01:33.014 --> 00:01:34.180 align:middle line:90%
and I'm going to read those.

00:01:34.180 --> 00:01:36.690 align:middle line:84%
There were a lot of very
flattering, lovely emails

00:01:36.690 --> 00:01:40.640 align:middle line:84%
from people who can't wait to
see other installments of you

00:01:40.640 --> 00:01:41.427 align:middle line:90%
on the show.

00:01:41.427 --> 00:01:42.010 align:middle line:90%
>>WILLS: Sure.

00:01:42.010 --> 00:01:44.153 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: This particular
one, I think is good,

00:01:44.153 --> 00:01:45.990 align:middle line:90%
and it's worth pointing out.

00:01:45.990 --> 00:01:49.390 align:middle line:84%
It's talking about, so the
negative ETs providing us

00:01:49.390 --> 00:01:51.920 align:middle line:84%
with the new world order,
billionaire psychopaths,

00:01:51.920 --> 00:01:54.680 align:middle line:84%
biotech nanotech, mind
control, zero point energy,

00:01:54.680 --> 00:01:57.370 align:middle line:84%
and the good ETs
are giving us Jerry.

00:01:57.370 --> 00:01:59.550 align:middle line:84%
And essentially,
this saying, they're

00:01:59.550 --> 00:02:05.200 align:middle line:84%
trying-- this is very long--
control the entire planet.

00:02:05.200 --> 00:02:08.150 align:middle line:84%
But where does that leave
the rest of humanity

00:02:08.150 --> 00:02:11.220 align:middle line:84%
that doesn't get this
type of personal training?

00:02:11.220 --> 00:02:12.160 align:middle line:90%
That's a question.

00:02:12.160 --> 00:02:14.240 align:middle line:84%
That was a frustration
of a few people.

00:02:14.240 --> 00:02:17.360 align:middle line:84%
Nice if he can do it, wherever
he's from, but where's

00:02:17.360 --> 00:02:18.651 align:middle line:90%
that leave the rest of us?

00:02:18.651 --> 00:02:19.150 align:middle line:90%
You know?

00:02:19.150 --> 00:02:21.830 align:middle line:84%
This whole notion
of being special.

00:02:21.830 --> 00:02:24.490 align:middle line:84%
>>WILLS: You know, the
comment that, well, there's

00:02:24.490 --> 00:02:27.244 align:middle line:84%
all these bad guys,
and then there's me.

00:02:27.244 --> 00:02:27.910 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:02:27.910 --> 00:02:29.620 align:middle line:10%
>>WILLS: But the
reality is that I

00:02:29.620 --> 00:02:32.620 align:middle line:10%
was just one of quite a
number who were brought here.

00:02:32.620 --> 00:02:35.040 align:middle line:10%
The other ones haven't become
vocal or made themselves

00:02:35.040 --> 00:02:35.946 align:middle line:10%
that well known.

00:02:35.946 --> 00:02:37.320 align:middle line:84%
But they're still
out there doing

00:02:37.320 --> 00:02:38.485 align:middle line:90%
what they came here to do.

00:02:38.485 --> 00:02:40.360 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And we talked
about this last time.

00:02:40.360 --> 00:02:43.210 align:middle line:84%
Each person has a slightly
different charter.

00:02:43.210 --> 00:02:46.970 align:middle line:84%
You came with a couple of things
in particular, the ability

00:02:46.970 --> 00:02:49.790 align:middle line:84%
to help us heal
ourselves, in addition

00:02:49.790 --> 00:02:52.700 align:middle line:84%
to helping expedite
that within others.

00:02:52.700 --> 00:02:53.410 align:middle line:90%
>>WILLS: Sure.

00:02:53.410 --> 00:02:56.480 align:middle line:10%
And then the thing that I
do, helping other people,

00:02:56.480 --> 00:03:01.830 align:middle line:10%
is something that's a tenet of
the people where I come from.

00:03:01.830 --> 00:03:03.470 align:middle line:84%
It's not a special
talent of mine.

00:03:03.470 --> 00:03:05.830 align:middle line:84%
It's just that I'm
using it in this way.

00:03:05.830 --> 00:03:08.990 align:middle line:84%
I felt that it was something
I could use to help others

00:03:08.990 --> 00:03:12.850 align:middle line:84%
and to fill a void
that was there.

00:03:12.850 --> 00:03:15.540 align:middle line:84%
And I know there was some
comments about, oh, yeah, sure,

00:03:15.540 --> 00:03:17.340 align:middle line:84%
Jerry's charging
money to do this.

00:03:17.340 --> 00:03:20.081 align:middle line:84%
Well, it's the only way
that bills get paid.

00:03:20.081 --> 00:03:21.330 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Well, not only that.

00:03:21.330 --> 00:03:23.371 align:middle line:84%
I think there's another
part of this story, which

00:03:23.371 --> 00:03:27.702 align:middle line:84%
is you do far more work
free than you are paid for.

00:03:27.702 --> 00:03:29.910 align:middle line:84%
>>WILLS: Well, those are
the ones no one knows about.

00:03:29.910 --> 00:03:32.368 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: You know they don't
know about them because these

00:03:32.368 --> 00:03:33.870 align:middle line:84%
are people in
desperate situations

00:03:33.870 --> 00:03:36.645 align:middle line:84%
who have tried everything else,
and it hasn't worked for them.

00:03:36.645 --> 00:03:37.520 align:middle line:90%
>>WILLS: That's true.

00:03:37.520 --> 00:03:41.222 align:middle line:84%
And a lot of people can't
afford to pay anything.

00:03:41.222 --> 00:03:42.400 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:03:42.400 --> 00:03:47.360 align:middle line:84%
>>WILLS: There was a lady that
I worked with just recently up

00:03:47.360 --> 00:03:49.410 align:middle line:90%
in the Washington area.

00:03:49.410 --> 00:03:50.865 align:middle line:90%
And it was quite a story.

00:03:50.865 --> 00:03:52.920 align:middle line:90%
She came to see me.

00:03:52.920 --> 00:03:55.740 align:middle line:84%
Said that she couldn't
see very well.

00:03:55.740 --> 00:04:00.010 align:middle line:90%
So there was no cost.

00:04:00.010 --> 00:04:01.930 align:middle line:84%
This was not about
doing anything

00:04:01.930 --> 00:04:03.770 align:middle line:90%
for any amount of money.

00:04:03.770 --> 00:04:05.605 align:middle line:84%
And I said, well,
I'm really sorry.

00:04:05.605 --> 00:04:06.980 align:middle line:84%
But let me see if
I can help you.

00:04:06.980 --> 00:04:08.674 align:middle line:90%
I don't know if it will work.

00:04:08.674 --> 00:04:09.840 align:middle line:90%
And I tell that to everyone.

00:04:09.840 --> 00:04:13.160 align:middle line:84%
I don't know how well this
is going to work for you.

00:04:13.160 --> 00:04:16.240 align:middle line:84%
After I finished, she was real
happy and crying and saying,

00:04:16.240 --> 00:04:18.529 align:middle line:90%
oh, I can see much better now.

00:04:18.529 --> 00:04:22.490 align:middle line:84%
I didn't know at the time
that she was legally blind.

00:04:22.490 --> 00:04:24.720 align:middle line:84%
And when I caught
up with her later,

00:04:24.720 --> 00:04:26.780 align:middle line:84%
she was impressing
others by reading out

00:04:26.780 --> 00:04:29.140 align:middle line:90%
of pamphlets and books.

00:04:29.140 --> 00:04:32.260 align:middle line:84%
Reading things she
was able to see now.

00:04:32.260 --> 00:04:37.990 align:middle line:84%
Before she left, when I
worked with her, because it

00:04:37.990 --> 00:04:41.090 align:middle line:84%
was for nothing--
I just, let me do

00:04:41.090 --> 00:04:45.040 align:middle line:84%
this to try and help-- she
said, I'm on a fixed income.

00:04:45.040 --> 00:04:47.810 align:middle line:84%
I only get $400 a month
in Social Security.

00:04:47.810 --> 00:04:50.350 align:middle line:90%
I only have $7 in my pocket.

00:04:50.350 --> 00:04:53.670 align:middle line:84%
It's all I have left
until I get paid again.

00:04:53.670 --> 00:04:56.030 align:middle line:90%
And she offered it to me.

00:04:56.030 --> 00:04:59.590 align:middle line:84%
And I said, you know, you
don't have to do that.

00:04:59.590 --> 00:05:01.400 align:middle line:84%
She says, no, I do
have to do this.

00:05:01.400 --> 00:05:04.080 align:middle line:90%
And she told me to keep it.

00:05:04.080 --> 00:05:06.150 align:middle line:90%
So I did.

00:05:06.150 --> 00:05:11.230 align:middle line:84%
There are a lot of folks
who come to see me,

00:05:11.230 --> 00:05:14.216 align:middle line:84%
that I work with over
the phone, and so forth,

00:05:14.216 --> 00:05:17.109 align:middle line:90%
and there's no money involved.

00:05:17.109 --> 00:05:17.650 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: No.

00:05:17.650 --> 00:05:19.685 align:middle line:90%
The lion's share of the people.

00:05:19.685 --> 00:05:20.810 align:middle line:90%
That's why I brought it up.

00:05:20.810 --> 00:05:23.500 align:middle line:84%
Because there was that,
why do you charge money

00:05:23.500 --> 00:05:26.320 align:middle line:90%
for when this should be a gift?

00:05:26.320 --> 00:05:28.794 align:middle line:84%
Well, it's lovely that
you know how to do this.

00:05:28.794 --> 00:05:30.460 align:middle line:84%
But I have a problem
with the word gift.

00:05:30.460 --> 00:05:31.799 align:middle line:90%
This isn't a gift.

00:05:31.799 --> 00:05:32.840 align:middle line:90%
>>WILLS: It's an ability.

00:05:32.840 --> 00:05:33.923 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: It's an ability.

00:05:33.923 --> 00:05:37.020 align:middle line:84%
>>WILLS: It's a state
of being that-- I've

00:05:37.020 --> 00:05:40.970 align:middle line:84%
been saying this over and
over-- that isn't unique to me.

00:05:40.970 --> 00:05:45.150 align:middle line:84%
I just know how to tap
into it very effectively.

00:05:45.150 --> 00:05:48.610 align:middle line:84%
It's a state of being that
every one of us possess.

00:05:48.610 --> 00:05:52.440 align:middle line:84%
And as far as how is
it that I can do it

00:05:52.440 --> 00:05:56.850 align:middle line:84%
and others can't, well, I try to
teach other people to do those.

00:05:56.850 --> 00:05:57.350 align:middle line:90%
And--

00:05:57.350 --> 00:05:59.724 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: That's going to be
the bulk of our conversation

00:05:59.724 --> 00:06:01.790 align:middle line:90%
today, essentially.

00:06:01.790 --> 00:06:04.090 align:middle line:84%
And also, the
roadblocks to that.

00:06:04.090 --> 00:06:07.030 align:middle line:90%
Because that is our birthright.

00:06:07.030 --> 00:06:09.970 align:middle line:84%
This is something that
came up regarding--

00:06:09.970 --> 00:06:15.700 align:middle line:84%
in another one of the emails,
my name is Maiden Hair in it.

00:06:15.700 --> 00:06:17.310 align:middle line:84%
I was called Maiden
Hair because I

00:06:17.310 --> 00:06:20.347 align:middle line:84%
was very naive in not asking
you to prove that you're an ET.

00:06:20.347 --> 00:06:22.930 align:middle line:84%
Which I'm not really quite sure
what proof you could offer me.

00:06:22.930 --> 00:06:26.000 align:middle line:84%
But you know, it was
doing my due diligence.

00:06:26.000 --> 00:06:30.120 align:middle line:84%
And part of it is that that
is so non-phenomenal to me.

00:06:30.120 --> 00:06:31.990 align:middle line:84%
I've been in this
world for a long time.

00:06:31.990 --> 00:06:33.770 align:middle line:84%
I know a lot of different
kinds of beings.

00:06:33.770 --> 00:06:35.550 align:middle line:84%
So it wouldn't
have occurred to me

00:06:35.550 --> 00:06:37.690 align:middle line:84%
to have you prove on
some level that you were

00:06:37.690 --> 00:06:40.640 align:middle line:84%
an ET with a special
birthmark or whatever

00:06:40.640 --> 00:06:42.420 align:middle line:90%
they were hoping to find there.

00:06:42.420 --> 00:06:47.465 align:middle line:84%
But they were talking about,
again, the same thing here.

00:06:47.465 --> 00:06:53.300 align:middle line:84%
[MUMBLING] "I left the path
30 years ago, but it taught me

00:06:53.300 --> 00:06:56.330 align:middle line:84%
a good lesson-- doubt
everything and ask for proof

00:06:56.330 --> 00:06:57.580 align:middle line:90%
where possible."

00:06:57.580 --> 00:07:01.920 align:middle line:84%
So on that note, part of the
reason I had felt comfortable

00:07:01.920 --> 00:07:04.160 align:middle line:84%
also is last time
we interviewed you,

00:07:04.160 --> 00:07:10.190 align:middle line:84%
I had a spontaneous little
vessel in my eye burst.

00:07:10.190 --> 00:07:11.290 align:middle line:90%
The whole thing was red.

00:07:11.290 --> 00:07:13.360 align:middle line:84%
The whole half of my
eye was blood red.

00:07:13.360 --> 00:07:15.732 align:middle line:84%
And it was embarrassing
because I had some shows to do.

00:07:15.732 --> 00:07:17.190 align:middle line:84%
And you couldn't
help but notice it

00:07:17.190 --> 00:07:18.880 align:middle line:84%
because you were
one of the people.

00:07:18.880 --> 00:07:21.980 align:middle line:84%
And so later that day, I guess
you did a little juju on it,

00:07:21.980 --> 00:07:23.650 align:middle line:84%
and by the next
day, it was gone.

00:07:23.650 --> 00:07:24.980 align:middle line:90%
And it was just a normal eye.

00:07:24.980 --> 00:07:26.940 align:middle line:84%
Which it normally
takes about two weeks

00:07:26.940 --> 00:07:29.580 align:middle line:84%
to clear that amount
of blood from the eye.

00:07:29.580 --> 00:07:32.995 align:middle line:84%
So I'd already experienced a
little bit of your abilities.

00:07:32.995 --> 00:07:35.120 align:middle line:84%
And I've seen other people
who've experienced them.

00:07:35.120 --> 00:07:36.820 align:middle line:84%
And I just wanted
to say that upfront.

00:07:36.820 --> 00:07:38.949 align:middle line:84%
So I wasn't really
looking to disprove you

00:07:38.949 --> 00:07:40.490 align:middle line:84%
because I've already
seen what you're

00:07:40.490 --> 00:07:43.220 align:middle line:90%
capable of doing personally.

00:07:43.220 --> 00:07:47.210 align:middle line:84%
So anyway, back to the
point, it is our birthright

00:07:47.210 --> 00:07:48.050 align:middle line:90%
to do this too.

00:07:48.050 --> 00:07:52.870 align:middle line:84%
And many of us heal each
other unknowingly even.

00:07:52.870 --> 00:07:53.770 align:middle line:90%
>>WILLS: I think so.

00:07:53.770 --> 00:07:54.990 align:middle line:90%
I've seen evidence of that.

00:07:54.990 --> 00:07:57.620 align:middle line:90%


00:07:57.620 --> 00:08:02.750 align:middle line:84%
Offering proof of something like
this is kind of off tangent.

00:08:02.750 --> 00:08:04.560 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes, it is.

00:08:04.560 --> 00:08:06.810 align:middle line:84%
>>WILLS: Offering proof that
I'm from somewhere else--

00:08:06.810 --> 00:08:10.210 align:middle line:84%
I tell folks, it really
doesn't matter where I'm from.

00:08:10.210 --> 00:08:12.250 align:middle line:90%
That's not the issue.

00:08:12.250 --> 00:08:14.610 align:middle line:84%
There are people from
Australia, and they

00:08:14.610 --> 00:08:16.460 align:middle line:90%
can pull out a passport.

00:08:16.460 --> 00:08:19.010 align:middle line:84%
You know, oh well, I thought
you might be from somewhere

00:08:19.010 --> 00:08:20.570 align:middle line:90%
else like Australia.

00:08:20.570 --> 00:08:24.580 align:middle line:84%
But the reality is, it
doesn't matter where I'm from.

00:08:24.580 --> 00:08:27.690 align:middle line:84%
It's not the messenger
that's important.

00:08:27.690 --> 00:08:29.854 align:middle line:84%
And I'm not trying to
be important because I

00:08:29.854 --> 00:08:31.020 align:middle line:90%
say I'm from somewhere else.

00:08:31.020 --> 00:08:34.039 align:middle line:84%
It's just a point of
information is well.

00:08:34.039 --> 00:08:36.020 align:middle line:84%
I don't care if anyone
believes it or not.

00:08:36.020 --> 00:08:37.993 align:middle line:90%
It's not important to me.

00:08:37.993 --> 00:08:39.159 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: It's your reality.

00:08:39.159 --> 00:08:40.034 align:middle line:90%
>>WILLS: Yeah, it is.

00:08:40.034 --> 00:08:41.360 align:middle line:90%
And that's all.

00:08:41.360 --> 00:08:42.110 align:middle line:90%
What's important--

00:08:42.110 --> 00:08:44.059 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And you say
where you're from,

00:08:44.059 --> 00:08:46.140 align:middle line:84%
that this-- everybody
knows how to-- this is just

00:08:46.140 --> 00:08:48.870 align:middle line:84%
a normal part of being,
to be able to heal.

00:08:48.870 --> 00:08:49.581 align:middle line:90%
>>WILLS: Sure.

00:08:49.581 --> 00:08:50.080 align:middle line:90%
It is.

00:08:50.080 --> 00:08:53.980 align:middle line:84%
It's just a standard
tool set that everyone

00:08:53.980 --> 00:08:57.350 align:middle line:84%
has available to
them, there and here.

00:08:57.350 --> 00:09:01.840 align:middle line:84%
Because really, when you
take a look at the people

00:09:01.840 --> 00:09:04.260 align:middle line:84%
from there, wherever
there is-- it

00:09:04.260 --> 00:09:08.040 align:middle line:84%
could be any number
of places-- and you

00:09:08.040 --> 00:09:10.100 align:middle line:84%
examine them and you
examine the people here,

00:09:10.100 --> 00:09:12.090 align:middle line:84%
there are slight
differences, just like you'd

00:09:12.090 --> 00:09:17.860 align:middle line:84%
find between people from
Italy or the Aboriginals

00:09:17.860 --> 00:09:19.120 align:middle line:90%
from Australia.

00:09:19.120 --> 00:09:22.680 align:middle line:84%
I mean, you've got differences,
but there on the same planet.

00:09:22.680 --> 00:09:24.239 align:middle line:84%
We have differences
between people

00:09:24.239 --> 00:09:26.280 align:middle line:84%
like that in other worlds
too, but they all still

00:09:26.280 --> 00:09:30.240 align:middle line:84%
have the basic subset of
tools available to them

00:09:30.240 --> 00:09:32.159 align:middle line:84%
because they are
alive, they're people.

00:09:32.159 --> 00:09:33.200 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: They're people.

00:09:33.200 --> 00:09:35.770 align:middle line:84%
And these are cosmic
energies we're

00:09:35.770 --> 00:09:37.880 align:middle line:84%
working with that run
through each one of us.

00:09:37.880 --> 00:09:38.519 align:middle line:90%
>>WILLS: It is.

00:09:38.519 --> 00:09:39.060 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: OK.

00:09:39.060 --> 00:09:42.000 align:middle line:84%
So now, this brings me to
this part of the conversation.

00:09:42.000 --> 00:09:44.410 align:middle line:84%
You wrote an article
several years ago.

00:09:44.410 --> 00:09:47.750 align:middle line:84%
It was called "When God
Sighs," about why we're

00:09:47.750 --> 00:09:49.290 align:middle line:90%
afraid to heal one another.

00:09:49.290 --> 00:09:53.330 align:middle line:84%
And I'd like to go into
this because everything's

00:09:53.330 --> 00:09:56.920 align:middle line:84%
limited to our fears
and our perceptions.

00:09:56.920 --> 00:09:58.170 align:middle line:90%
>>WILLS: Sure.

00:09:58.170 --> 00:10:01.520 align:middle line:84%
One of the reasons why I
wrote this was because there

00:10:01.520 --> 00:10:05.730 align:middle line:84%
are folks that really
want to do something

00:10:05.730 --> 00:10:10.540 align:middle line:84%
good for another person in
aspects of healing, let's say.

00:10:10.540 --> 00:10:12.190 align:middle line:84%
And when it doesn't
work, they're

00:10:12.190 --> 00:10:16.630 align:middle line:84%
asking themselves,
what did I do wrong?

00:10:16.630 --> 00:10:19.660 align:middle line:84%
What could I have
done differently?

00:10:19.660 --> 00:10:24.110 align:middle line:84%
Did I not do this
or that properly?

00:10:24.110 --> 00:10:27.034 align:middle line:84%
And when it does work,
they're really impressed.

00:10:27.034 --> 00:10:28.700 align:middle line:84%
They get a bit more
confidence, and they

00:10:28.700 --> 00:10:31.390 align:middle line:84%
feel like they've really
done something great.

00:10:31.390 --> 00:10:32.890 align:middle line:84%
But then they're
going, well, I have

00:10:32.890 --> 00:10:35.210 align:middle line:84%
to protect myself
because I don't

00:10:35.210 --> 00:10:38.200 align:middle line:84%
want to get the whatever it
is this person might have.

00:10:38.200 --> 00:10:42.870 align:middle line:84%
I don't want to get their aches,
pains, bad energy, whatever.

00:10:42.870 --> 00:10:45.440 align:middle line:84%
The point that I was
making in this article

00:10:45.440 --> 00:10:49.190 align:middle line:84%
is that if it works or
if it doesn't, it's not

00:10:49.190 --> 00:10:52.480 align:middle line:90%
because you made the choice.

00:10:52.480 --> 00:10:55.100 align:middle line:84%
If you're the
person who is going

00:10:55.100 --> 00:10:58.030 align:middle line:84%
to be the one who has the
ultimate amount of wisdom

00:10:58.030 --> 00:11:03.420 align:middle line:84%
to determine whether or not
this other person's illness

00:11:03.420 --> 00:11:09.160 align:middle line:84%
or whatever's wrong with
them no longer serves them,

00:11:09.160 --> 00:11:11.270 align:middle line:90%
then you must be God.

00:11:11.270 --> 00:11:14.860 align:middle line:84%
Because the only way that
you can interfere with

00:11:14.860 --> 00:11:19.510 align:middle line:84%
another person's path
is if it's allowed.

00:11:19.510 --> 00:11:23.410 align:middle line:84%
In other words,
regardless of the outcome,

00:11:23.410 --> 00:11:24.860 align:middle line:90%
it's in God's hands.

00:11:24.860 --> 00:11:26.480 align:middle line:90%
If it works, it belongs to God.

00:11:26.480 --> 00:11:28.910 align:middle line:84%
If it doesn't work,
it belongs to God.

00:11:28.910 --> 00:11:30.460 align:middle line:90%
Take the ego out of it.

00:11:30.460 --> 00:11:31.230 align:middle line:90%
It wasn't you.

00:11:31.230 --> 00:11:34.220 align:middle line:84%
It wasn't something that
made you special or less

00:11:34.220 --> 00:11:37.040 align:middle line:84%
than special, whether it
worked or if it didn't work.

00:11:37.040 --> 00:11:39.140 align:middle line:84%
You don't know what the
underlying reality is

00:11:39.140 --> 00:11:44.280 align:middle line:90%
and that person's path.

00:11:44.280 --> 00:11:46.310 align:middle line:84%
And that's why I
wrote the article.

00:11:46.310 --> 00:11:49.020 align:middle line:84%
I wanted to try and
clear that up for folks.

00:11:49.020 --> 00:11:52.640 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: That's
a really big one.

00:11:52.640 --> 00:11:55.100 align:middle line:84%
Actually, you and I had
an off-camera conversation

00:11:55.100 --> 00:11:56.250 align:middle line:90%
about that.

00:11:56.250 --> 00:11:59.840 align:middle line:84%
Because it was something
that dogged me, even

00:11:59.840 --> 00:12:01.880 align:middle line:90%
on a personal level.

00:12:01.880 --> 00:12:04.050 align:middle line:84%
Another one of our
interviewees, who

00:12:04.050 --> 00:12:08.600 align:middle line:84%
is also a friend, who also lives
in Sedona now, Stephen Ross.

00:12:08.600 --> 00:12:15.770 align:middle line:84%
Stephen Ross was exposed to
a protocol for doing healing.

00:12:15.770 --> 00:12:19.770 align:middle line:84%
And it had oftentimes
an instantaneous effect.

00:12:19.770 --> 00:12:24.780 align:middle line:84%
And it's just
something that he does.

00:12:24.780 --> 00:12:25.780 align:middle line:90%
He's not known for that.

00:12:25.780 --> 00:12:27.650 align:middle line:84%
It's just something
that he's able to do.

00:12:27.650 --> 00:12:32.520 align:middle line:84%
And so one day, he told
me that his guidance

00:12:32.520 --> 00:12:36.590 align:middle line:84%
was telling him that he was
supposed to pass that on to me.

00:12:36.590 --> 00:12:40.902 align:middle line:84%
And so, when I was ready-- well,
two days later, I was panicked.

00:12:40.902 --> 00:12:41.610 align:middle line:90%
And I called him.

00:12:41.610 --> 00:12:43.070 align:middle line:90%
I have to know now.

00:12:43.070 --> 00:12:45.070 align:middle line:84%
And he handed me a paper
with a paragraph on it.

00:12:45.070 --> 00:12:47.020 align:middle line:84%
It was really quite
simple, as most healing

00:12:47.020 --> 00:12:48.710 align:middle line:90%
can be quite simple.

00:12:48.710 --> 00:12:52.630 align:middle line:84%
And the next day, my
closest friend had a stroke.

00:12:52.630 --> 00:12:54.665 align:middle line:84%
And it was when
needed that, and she

00:12:54.665 --> 00:12:57.040 align:middle line:84%
was in the midst of having
the stroke when she called,

00:12:57.040 --> 00:13:01.470 align:middle line:84%
and her speech was slurred,
and she was losing the strength

00:13:01.470 --> 00:13:02.930 align:middle line:90%
on one side of her body.

00:13:02.930 --> 00:13:06.290 align:middle line:84%
And then I remembered
that and executed it.

00:13:06.290 --> 00:13:09.520 align:middle line:84%
And this happened a few times,
where it just reversed it.

00:13:09.520 --> 00:13:10.984 align:middle line:84%
And it reversed
the blood markers.

00:13:10.984 --> 00:13:12.900 align:middle line:84%
You would not know that
anything had happened.

00:13:12.900 --> 00:13:16.150 align:middle line:84%
It worked exactly as
it should have worked.

00:13:16.150 --> 00:13:21.440 align:middle line:84%
But the one difference there was
that little protocol had said,

00:13:21.440 --> 00:13:24.600 align:middle line:84%
or he had said, just check in,
just check in on a soul to soul

00:13:24.600 --> 00:13:27.870 align:middle line:84%
level first and
make sure it's OK.

00:13:27.870 --> 00:13:31.547 align:middle line:84%
You're saying we don't even
need to do that, really?

00:13:31.547 --> 00:13:32.880 align:middle line:90%
>>WILLS: It's just another step.

00:13:32.880 --> 00:13:34.390 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Because it's going
to define itself anyway, right?

00:13:34.390 --> 00:13:35.310 align:middle line:90%
>>WILLS: Right.

00:13:35.310 --> 00:13:41.270 align:middle line:84%
I've worked on people that were
having their issue because it

00:13:41.270 --> 00:13:43.087 align:middle line:90%
was part of their path.

00:13:43.087 --> 00:13:43.670 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:13:43.670 --> 00:13:45.225 align:middle line:90%
That's what I wanted to get to.

00:13:45.225 --> 00:13:48.000 align:middle line:84%
Well, to finish that little
part of the story up, being

00:13:48.000 --> 00:13:52.700 align:middle line:84%
incarnated as a woman, which
is true with a lot of women,

00:13:52.700 --> 00:13:55.900 align:middle line:84%
for reasons of
historical, made to feel

00:13:55.900 --> 00:13:58.440 align:middle line:84%
quite uncomfortable at
these abilities in times

00:13:58.440 --> 00:14:02.890 align:middle line:84%
past or whatnot, I just wouldn't
continue using those skills

00:14:02.890 --> 00:14:06.450 align:middle line:84%
unless it was an emergency,
and it just happened quickly.

00:14:06.450 --> 00:14:07.760 align:middle line:90%
And that's why we were talking.

00:14:07.760 --> 00:14:11.250 align:middle line:84%
I said, I feel kind of
embarrassed that I am not more

00:14:11.250 --> 00:14:13.540 align:middle line:90%
of service in that capacity.

00:14:13.540 --> 00:14:17.030 align:middle line:84%
And it really does come down
to just a confidence thing.

00:14:17.030 --> 00:14:20.170 align:middle line:84%
Even though I've seen it work,
there's still this, yeah,

00:14:20.170 --> 00:14:23.890 align:middle line:84%
but what if it doesn't and
then having to be wrong.

00:14:23.890 --> 00:14:26.150 align:middle line:90%
>>WILLS: Well, there you go.

00:14:26.150 --> 00:14:28.400 align:middle line:90%
You're never wrong.

00:14:28.400 --> 00:14:32.290 align:middle line:90%
You do what you feel led to do.

00:14:32.290 --> 00:14:33.760 align:middle line:90%
You feel it in your heart.

00:14:33.760 --> 00:14:36.500 align:middle line:90%
You feel it really in your soul.

00:14:36.500 --> 00:14:39.640 align:middle line:84%
It's a state of being, is
what I'm trying to say.

00:14:39.640 --> 00:14:40.480 align:middle line:90%
And you feel it.

00:14:40.480 --> 00:14:41.580 align:middle line:90%
You just do it.

00:14:41.580 --> 00:14:43.560 align:middle line:90%
And if it works, great.

00:14:43.560 --> 00:14:46.460 align:middle line:84%
If it doesn't, that's
the way it goes.

00:14:46.460 --> 00:14:50.270 align:middle line:84%
You aren't the one who
makes the decision.

00:14:50.270 --> 00:14:52.360 align:middle line:84%
God lives within
you, but it also

00:14:52.360 --> 00:14:54.580 align:middle line:90%
lives within this other person.

00:14:54.580 --> 00:14:59.750 align:middle line:84%
And that other
person has something

00:14:59.750 --> 00:15:01.600 align:middle line:90%
going that's in their path.

00:15:01.600 --> 00:15:06.020 align:middle line:84%
Now sometimes, it's as
innocuous as stepping

00:15:06.020 --> 00:15:08.960 align:middle line:84%
on a tack on the floor,
and you're going,

00:15:08.960 --> 00:15:10.340 align:middle line:90%
holy mackerel, that hurts.

00:15:10.340 --> 00:15:11.720 align:middle line:90%
You pull the tack out.

00:15:11.720 --> 00:15:13.370 align:middle line:90%
Then you start leaking.

00:15:13.370 --> 00:15:14.341 align:middle line:90%
Blood comes out.

00:15:14.341 --> 00:15:14.840 align:middle line:90%
Rub it.

00:15:14.840 --> 00:15:16.970 align:middle line:90%
It's stinging.

00:15:16.970 --> 00:15:19.290 align:middle line:84%
And that's just-- there
there's no cosmic message there

00:15:19.290 --> 00:15:20.350 align:middle line:90%
for you.

00:15:20.350 --> 00:15:21.569 align:middle line:90%
We could probably invent one.

00:15:21.569 --> 00:15:23.110 align:middle line:84%
Well, maybe your
awareness isn't in--

00:15:23.110 --> 00:15:24.650 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Afraid to move
forward or something like that.

00:15:24.650 --> 00:15:25.951 align:middle line:90%
>>WILLS: Or invent something.

00:15:25.951 --> 00:15:28.200 align:middle line:84%
But the reality is, it's
just something that happened.

00:15:28.200 --> 00:15:31.730 align:middle line:90%
It's just a bump in the road.

00:15:31.730 --> 00:15:34.210 align:middle line:84%
There are things like that
that happen to people,

00:15:34.210 --> 00:15:36.730 align:middle line:84%
I don't think were
supposed to happen.

00:15:36.730 --> 00:15:38.880 align:middle line:84%
And those are the
people that I can help.

00:15:38.880 --> 00:15:42.010 align:middle line:84%
There are others who have
things wrong with them.

00:15:42.010 --> 00:15:44.025 align:middle line:84%
And these things
I can't approach.

00:15:44.025 --> 00:15:46.590 align:middle line:90%


00:15:46.590 --> 00:15:51.980 align:middle line:84%
For example, I can
work on, let's say,

00:15:51.980 --> 00:15:53.910 align:middle line:84%
I'm just going
throw out a number,

00:15:53.910 --> 00:15:57.050 align:middle line:84%
say five people who have
different kinds of cancer.

00:15:57.050 --> 00:16:01.920 align:middle line:90%
And they are in bad, bad shape.

00:16:01.920 --> 00:16:05.760 align:middle line:84%
All five of them,
suddenly nothing is wrong.

00:16:05.760 --> 00:16:11.070 align:middle line:84%
And this is established
from doctors' tests.

00:16:11.070 --> 00:16:13.450 align:middle line:90%
Here comes number six.

00:16:13.450 --> 00:16:14.590 align:middle line:90%
Cancer again.

00:16:14.590 --> 00:16:15.440 align:middle line:90%
I work on them.

00:16:15.440 --> 00:16:17.100 align:middle line:90%
Nothing happens.

00:16:17.100 --> 00:16:19.270 align:middle line:90%
Why is that?

00:16:19.270 --> 00:16:22.420 align:middle line:84%
Well, it's because
this is happening

00:16:22.420 --> 00:16:24.410 align:middle line:90%
in their life for a purpose.

00:16:24.410 --> 00:16:28.040 align:middle line:90%
This is their path back to God.

00:16:28.040 --> 00:16:30.270 align:middle line:90%
Whatever that means.

00:16:30.270 --> 00:16:33.330 align:middle line:84%
It's the best phrase-ism
I could come up with.

00:16:33.330 --> 00:16:35.260 align:middle line:90%
But it's their path back to God.

00:16:35.260 --> 00:16:39.010 align:middle line:84%
And I can't interfere
with that because I'll

00:16:39.010 --> 00:16:41.500 align:middle line:90%
be interfering with their path.

00:16:41.500 --> 00:16:45.690 align:middle line:84%
And in doing so, well,
it's just not allowed.

00:16:45.690 --> 00:16:48.620 align:middle line:84%
But if I were to really push
it and go, holy mackerel,

00:16:48.620 --> 00:16:50.070 align:middle line:90%
this can't be.

00:16:50.070 --> 00:16:52.040 align:middle line:84%
I just won't allow
this to happen.

00:16:52.040 --> 00:16:54.370 align:middle line:84%
If I were to be so
bold as to go there,

00:16:54.370 --> 00:16:57.500 align:middle line:84%
which I wouldn't,
and I changed it--

00:16:57.500 --> 00:17:03.480 align:middle line:84%
what has that done to that
person's soul's progression?

00:17:03.480 --> 00:17:05.210 align:middle line:90%
It has altered it forever.

00:17:05.210 --> 00:17:07.839 align:middle line:84%
And now what are they going
to have to go through?

00:17:07.839 --> 00:17:10.895 align:middle line:84%
What other things will
they have to endure?

00:17:10.895 --> 00:17:12.270 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Because
whatever needed

00:17:12.270 --> 00:17:14.452 align:middle line:84%
to be embraced or
learned was not learned.

00:17:14.452 --> 00:17:16.410 align:middle line:84%
>>WILLS: And then someone's
interfered with it.

00:17:16.410 --> 00:17:17.076 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:17:17.076 --> 00:17:19.520 align:middle line:84%
>>WILLS: How dare
I do such a thing?

00:17:19.520 --> 00:17:20.020 align:middle line:90%
So I don't.

00:17:20.020 --> 00:17:22.318 align:middle line:90%


00:17:22.318 --> 00:17:22.859 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: OK.

00:17:22.859 --> 00:17:24.990 align:middle line:84%
Let's talk about
cancer for a moment.

00:17:24.990 --> 00:17:31.600 align:middle line:84%
Because you'll say, five are OK,
and then the next one is not.

00:17:31.600 --> 00:17:34.970 align:middle line:90%
Cancer is so pervasive.

00:17:34.970 --> 00:17:38.280 align:middle line:84%
From what you're seeing,
is it that it's simply

00:17:38.280 --> 00:17:41.380 align:middle line:84%
a chronic condition having
to do with all the overload

00:17:41.380 --> 00:17:44.980 align:middle line:84%
factors of whether it's
chemicals, diet, fear,

00:17:44.980 --> 00:17:48.305 align:middle line:84%
or whatever that have overloaded
the body to this state, where

00:17:48.305 --> 00:17:51.200 align:middle line:84%
it kind of starts eating
itself, so to speak?

00:17:51.200 --> 00:17:52.700 align:middle line:84%
Like you say, it's
not necessarily

00:17:52.700 --> 00:17:57.585 align:middle line:84%
inherent to a larger life
lesson in so many people?

00:17:57.585 --> 00:17:58.960 align:middle line:84%
>>WILLS: Well, I
mean, there's so

00:17:58.960 --> 00:18:01.440 align:middle line:90%
many reasons why this happens.

00:18:01.440 --> 00:18:03.780 align:middle line:84%
And usually, when I
work with someone,

00:18:03.780 --> 00:18:05.300 align:middle line:90%
I can move them through time.

00:18:05.300 --> 00:18:09.420 align:middle line:84%
I can see where it started,
and how it will probably

00:18:09.420 --> 00:18:15.340 align:middle line:84%
end if left unattended, and
the reasons that it occurs.

00:18:15.340 --> 00:18:17.120 align:middle line:84%
I mean, you have
everything from,

00:18:17.120 --> 00:18:21.050 align:middle line:84%
oh it's an emotional thing,
or karmic life lesson,

00:18:21.050 --> 00:18:23.400 align:middle line:90%
or fill in the blanks.

00:18:23.400 --> 00:18:25.850 align:middle line:84%
But what I see
more than anything,

00:18:25.850 --> 00:18:29.150 align:middle line:84%
is that it's a toxic
environment, and the body's

00:18:29.150 --> 00:18:32.230 align:middle line:84%
inability to cope
with it any longer.

00:18:32.230 --> 00:18:33.830 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Which is
not a soul lesson.

00:18:33.830 --> 00:18:34.660 align:middle line:84%
>>WILLS: No, it's
just a state of being.

00:18:34.660 --> 00:18:37.210 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: It's just a state of
being, living in these times.

00:18:37.210 --> 00:18:37.793 align:middle line:90%
>>WILLS: Sure.

00:18:37.793 --> 00:18:40.810 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And these
environmental conditions.

00:18:40.810 --> 00:18:42.850 align:middle line:84%
>>WILLS: So you
know, I do the best

00:18:42.850 --> 00:18:44.810 align:middle line:90%
I can try to try and help folks.

00:18:44.810 --> 00:18:47.760 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So now, in
a situation like that,

00:18:47.760 --> 00:18:51.800 align:middle line:84%
where a person has cancer that's
developed from-- first of all,

00:18:51.800 --> 00:18:55.690 align:middle line:84%
now we're putting it
back on the individual.

00:18:55.690 --> 00:18:58.394 align:middle line:84%
How can they look
inside themselves

00:18:58.394 --> 00:18:59.810 align:middle line:84%
and determine
whether this is just

00:18:59.810 --> 00:19:03.190 align:middle line:84%
something that happened
due to these stressors,

00:19:03.190 --> 00:19:06.464 align:middle line:90%
versus an actual life lesson?

00:19:06.464 --> 00:19:08.630 align:middle line:84%
>>WILLS: I think they just
have to go within and ask

00:19:08.630 --> 00:19:10.670 align:middle line:90%
those questions.

00:19:10.670 --> 00:19:13.700 align:middle line:84%
Regardless of what happens
to you that isn't good,

00:19:13.700 --> 00:19:16.510 align:middle line:84%
you're going to reflect on
it and try to find answers.

00:19:16.510 --> 00:19:18.500 align:middle line:90%
That's just the way it is.

00:19:18.500 --> 00:19:21.600 align:middle line:84%
And the lessons that
are in that are,

00:19:21.600 --> 00:19:23.710 align:middle line:90%
what are you coming up with?

00:19:23.710 --> 00:19:26.950 align:middle line:84%
And it's going to be within
the paradigm of what you know.

00:19:26.950 --> 00:19:27.630 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:19:27.630 --> 00:19:28.960 align:middle line:84%
>>WILLS: It's not going
to be outside of that

00:19:28.960 --> 00:19:29.970 align:middle line:90%
because how could it be?

00:19:29.970 --> 00:19:32.420 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Oh, I ate Twinkies
every day for 20 years.

00:19:32.420 --> 00:19:33.197 align:middle line:90%
I mean, OK.

00:19:33.197 --> 00:19:33.780 align:middle line:90%
>>WILLS: Yeah.

00:19:33.780 --> 00:19:34.446 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:19:34.446 --> 00:19:36.910 align:middle line:84%
>>WILLS: But then, for some
of these folks, I see this

00:19:36.910 --> 00:19:39.050 align:middle line:84%
and I say, you
know, it was this,

00:19:39.050 --> 00:19:42.910 align:middle line:84%
or it was that, or
this other thing.

00:19:42.910 --> 00:19:45.820 align:middle line:84%
And they're going, I didn't
even know about that.

00:19:45.820 --> 00:19:49.570 align:middle line:84%
And suddenly, their whole story
changes of why this happens.

00:19:49.570 --> 00:19:52.090 align:middle line:90%
Knowledge goes a long way.

00:19:52.090 --> 00:19:57.310 align:middle line:84%
It doesn't explain
how it can be abated.

00:19:57.310 --> 00:19:59.500 align:middle line:84%
But in some ways,
it does explain how

00:19:59.500 --> 00:20:01.250 align:middle line:90%
it could be avoided perhaps.

00:20:01.250 --> 00:20:02.010 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Exactly.

00:20:02.010 --> 00:20:03.801 align:middle line:84%
I mean, that's what
I'm finding interesting

00:20:03.801 --> 00:20:05.110 align:middle line:90%
about that comment you made.

00:20:05.110 --> 00:20:07.530 align:middle line:84%
That kind of five
to one ratio, which

00:20:07.530 --> 00:20:10.110 align:middle line:84%
was maybe just a casual
number, maybe not,

00:20:10.110 --> 00:20:12.170 align:middle line:84%
is that so much
cancer really isn't

00:20:12.170 --> 00:20:15.920 align:middle line:84%
about a disharmony on a
soul level of something

00:20:15.920 --> 00:20:17.130 align:middle line:90%
that hasn't been played out.

00:20:17.130 --> 00:20:18.490 align:middle line:84%
It's just something that
happens in the body.

00:20:18.490 --> 00:20:20.073 align:middle line:84%
>>WILLS: And people
ask me about this.

00:20:20.073 --> 00:20:22.440 align:middle line:90%
And I say, I don't look at that.

00:20:22.440 --> 00:20:25.590 align:middle line:84%
Disharmony on a
soul level, really?

00:20:25.590 --> 00:20:28.120 align:middle line:90%
It's karma?

00:20:28.120 --> 00:20:29.590 align:middle line:84%
I think there's a
misunderstanding

00:20:29.590 --> 00:20:30.726 align:middle line:90%
of what karma actually is.

00:20:30.726 --> 00:20:31.350 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Good.

00:20:31.350 --> 00:20:32.640 align:middle line:90%
Explain that.

00:20:32.640 --> 00:20:34.940 align:middle line:84%
>>WILLS: Well, it's
just my opinion.

00:20:34.940 --> 00:20:37.090 align:middle line:84%
You know, you had
another lifetime,

00:20:37.090 --> 00:20:39.410 align:middle line:90%
and things didn't go well.

00:20:39.410 --> 00:20:41.390 align:middle line:84%
Maybe you did something
and screwed up.

00:20:41.390 --> 00:20:45.200 align:middle line:90%
Who knows what the thing is.

00:20:45.200 --> 00:20:48.160 align:middle line:90%
It's a story.

00:20:48.160 --> 00:20:50.780 align:middle line:84%
So now, here you are
in this life time.

00:20:50.780 --> 00:20:53.130 align:middle line:84%
And everything's going
along swimmingly,

00:20:53.130 --> 00:20:54.670 align:middle line:90%
and you're having a great life.

00:20:54.670 --> 00:20:58.800 align:middle line:84%
And all of a sudden,
something bad happens to you.

00:20:58.800 --> 00:21:03.390 align:middle line:84%
And there are always those
who will pop up and say,

00:21:03.390 --> 00:21:06.780 align:middle line:84%
that last lifetime, you
screwed up about such and such,

00:21:06.780 --> 00:21:07.960 align:middle line:90%
and this and that.

00:21:07.960 --> 00:21:11.830 align:middle line:90%
And this is your payback.

00:21:11.830 --> 00:21:14.970 align:middle line:90%


00:21:14.970 --> 00:21:19.900 align:middle line:84%
If you don't remember
it at all, and I

00:21:19.900 --> 00:21:22.140 align:middle line:90%
haven't found anyone who does--

00:21:22.140 --> 00:21:24.260 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:21:24.260 --> 00:21:25.740 align:middle line:84%
>>WILLS: --how is
that even fair?

00:21:25.740 --> 00:21:26.620 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Exactly.

00:21:26.620 --> 00:21:27.620 align:middle line:90%
It's very disempowering.

00:21:27.620 --> 00:21:32.750 align:middle line:84%
>>WILLS: It's like getting a
really bad slap because someone

00:21:32.750 --> 00:21:35.400 align:middle line:90%
said, oh, I know.

00:21:35.400 --> 00:21:37.780 align:middle line:84%
You were thinking about
that in the third grade.

00:21:37.780 --> 00:21:39.820 align:middle line:90%
And now, here you are.

00:21:39.820 --> 00:21:41.610 align:middle line:90%
You're 40 years old.

00:21:41.610 --> 00:21:43.600 align:middle line:84%
And I want to slap you
because you thought

00:21:43.600 --> 00:21:44.940 align:middle line:90%
that in the third grade.

00:21:44.940 --> 00:21:48.770 align:middle line:90%
It just seems ridiculous to me.

00:21:48.770 --> 00:21:52.600 align:middle line:84%
What I see is like a
law of reciprocity.

00:21:52.600 --> 00:21:55.980 align:middle line:84%
You reap what you
sow in this life.

00:21:55.980 --> 00:21:58.310 align:middle line:84%
You do something
good, and you're not

00:21:58.310 --> 00:22:00.624 align:middle line:84%
going to get reimbursed
because you did something good.

00:22:00.624 --> 00:22:03.040 align:middle line:84%
You just did something good
because that's the true nature

00:22:03.040 --> 00:22:06.240 align:middle line:90%
of who you are at the core.

00:22:06.240 --> 00:22:08.460 align:middle line:84%
You do something bad,
it sends out ripples,

00:22:08.460 --> 00:22:10.920 align:middle line:90%
just like doing something good.

00:22:10.920 --> 00:22:14.620 align:middle line:84%
But the ripples where you did
something bad go bouncing off,

00:22:14.620 --> 00:22:17.250 align:middle line:84%
and you start getting
this from other people.

00:22:17.250 --> 00:22:19.430 align:middle line:84%
It's kind of like if you're
in a group of friends,

00:22:19.430 --> 00:22:22.580 align:middle line:84%
and suddenly someone
does something,

00:22:22.580 --> 00:22:24.450 align:middle line:84%
and you just lose
respect for them.

00:22:24.450 --> 00:22:25.380 align:middle line:90%
They cheated you.

00:22:25.380 --> 00:22:26.088 align:middle line:90%
They lied to you.

00:22:26.088 --> 00:22:28.240 align:middle line:90%
They did something dishonest.

00:22:28.240 --> 00:22:31.700 align:middle line:84%
And now suddenly, you
feel bad towards them.

00:22:31.700 --> 00:22:33.580 align:middle line:84%
The person that did
it isn't getting

00:22:33.580 --> 00:22:35.500 align:middle line:84%
the benefit of
whatever it was they

00:22:35.500 --> 00:22:39.520 align:middle line:84%
were able to have in that
companionship with you

00:22:39.520 --> 00:22:45.120 align:middle line:84%
and their karma is
their losing out.

00:22:45.120 --> 00:22:47.980 align:middle line:84%
You see that kind of, what
they call instant karma,

00:22:47.980 --> 00:22:50.400 align:middle line:84%
I suppose-- I don't
know how instant it is.

00:22:50.400 --> 00:22:54.070 align:middle line:84%
But you see the evidence
of this all the time.

00:22:54.070 --> 00:22:58.590 align:middle line:84%
But I don't really buy
into the last lifetime,

00:22:58.590 --> 00:23:02.640 align:middle line:84%
or three lifetimes ago,
you were such and such,

00:23:02.640 --> 00:23:04.960 align:middle line:84%
and you did this and
that, and now, well, it's

00:23:04.960 --> 00:23:06.770 align:middle line:90%
time for payback.

00:23:06.770 --> 00:23:08.440 align:middle line:90%
It just seems goofy to me.

00:23:08.440 --> 00:23:09.860 align:middle line:90%
I just don't buy into it.

00:23:09.860 --> 00:23:11.389 align:middle line:90%
I don't think it's real.

00:23:11.389 --> 00:23:11.930 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: OK.

00:23:11.930 --> 00:23:16.270 align:middle line:84%
Now what about the notion
that somebody was say,

00:23:16.270 --> 00:23:20.500 align:middle line:84%
traumatically injured in their
shoulder in a recent lifetime,

00:23:20.500 --> 00:23:25.150 align:middle line:84%
and they come back in and
have problems or chronic pain,

00:23:25.150 --> 00:23:27.470 align:middle line:90%
say, in that region.

00:23:27.470 --> 00:23:31.190 align:middle line:84%
How does that work for
you, looking at it?

00:23:31.190 --> 00:23:34.210 align:middle line:84%
I mean, do see you causal
effect from another lifetime

00:23:34.210 --> 00:23:36.240 align:middle line:90%
sometimes into a body at all?

00:23:36.240 --> 00:23:37.340 align:middle line:90%
>>WILLS: No.

00:23:37.340 --> 00:23:38.560 align:middle line:90%
I don't look for that.

00:23:38.560 --> 00:23:39.130 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: OK.

00:23:39.130 --> 00:23:39.629 align:middle line:90%
All right.

00:23:39.629 --> 00:23:40.270 align:middle line:90%
Gotcha.

00:23:40.270 --> 00:23:42.530 align:middle line:84%
>>WILLS: Because I
think it's foolish.

00:23:42.530 --> 00:23:44.080 align:middle line:90%
I don't give it any reality.

00:23:44.080 --> 00:23:48.670 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So if we have
multiple incarnations,

00:23:48.670 --> 00:23:51.710 align:middle line:84%
and we've probably been
bludgeoned and drowned

00:23:51.710 --> 00:23:54.490 align:middle line:84%
and pretty much everything
that happens to humankind

00:23:54.490 --> 00:23:55.930 align:middle line:84%
throughout our
personal histories,

00:23:55.930 --> 00:23:58.013 align:middle line:84%
we've been traumatized in
a lot of different ways,

00:23:58.013 --> 00:23:59.650 align:middle line:84%
and here we are
fresh, starting again.

00:23:59.650 --> 00:24:02.480 align:middle line:90%


00:24:02.480 --> 00:24:04.080 align:middle line:84%
It sounds to me the
way you're looking

00:24:04.080 --> 00:24:06.770 align:middle line:90%
at it is, it's a fresh slate.

00:24:06.770 --> 00:24:08.030 align:middle line:90%
It's a fresh slate.

00:24:08.030 --> 00:24:11.410 align:middle line:84%
And you can only
see whether or not

00:24:11.410 --> 00:24:15.081 align:middle line:84%
your influence is going to be
allowed to help heal or not.

00:24:15.081 --> 00:24:15.580 align:middle line:90%
Right?

00:24:15.580 --> 00:24:16.980 align:middle line:90%
And that's where you go with it?

00:24:16.980 --> 00:24:18.271 align:middle line:90%
>>WILLS: That's pretty much it.

00:24:18.271 --> 00:24:20.700 align:middle line:84%
I'm not saying that this
other doesn't exist.

00:24:20.700 --> 00:24:22.840 align:middle line:84%
I don't have proof one
way or the other of it.

00:24:22.840 --> 00:24:26.340 align:middle line:84%
It's just my own
feelings about it.

00:24:26.340 --> 00:24:34.110 align:middle line:84%
And I've heard people argue
the details in both directions.

00:24:34.110 --> 00:24:37.510 align:middle line:84%
When I look and see what's
going on, like the bad shoulder,

00:24:37.510 --> 00:24:42.340 align:middle line:84%
for example, I look back,
and I see a lot of things

00:24:42.340 --> 00:24:44.630 align:middle line:90%
that I don't talk about.

00:24:44.630 --> 00:24:47.370 align:middle line:84%
Some of these things have
to do with other lifetimes.

00:24:47.370 --> 00:24:49.050 align:middle line:90%
Who is this person, really?

00:24:49.050 --> 00:24:51.920 align:middle line:90%


00:24:51.920 --> 00:24:54.750 align:middle line:90%
And I just don't see that.

00:24:54.750 --> 00:24:56.430 align:middle line:90%
I just don't see it.

00:24:56.430 --> 00:24:59.610 align:middle line:84%
I see there's a
weakness here that

00:24:59.610 --> 00:25:03.040 align:middle line:84%
was exacerbated by an
injury, and the injury now

00:25:03.040 --> 00:25:06.160 align:middle line:90%
has caused this to be painful.

00:25:06.160 --> 00:25:08.970 align:middle line:84%
What can be done to change
that in this moment?

00:25:08.970 --> 00:25:11.580 align:middle line:90%
How can we make this better?

00:25:11.580 --> 00:25:18.430 align:middle line:84%
In the case of one fellow, Tony,
he was a pitcher, a ballplayer.

00:25:18.430 --> 00:25:21.680 align:middle line:90%


00:25:21.680 --> 00:25:23.290 align:middle line:90%
He was actually quite good.

00:25:23.290 --> 00:25:28.310 align:middle line:84%
And then his arm, his shoulder,
torn rotator cuff, or whatever

00:25:28.310 --> 00:25:32.120 align:middle line:84%
it was, he just couldn't lift
his arm up very high at all.

00:25:32.120 --> 00:25:34.580 align:middle line:90%
It took 15 minutes to fix.

00:25:34.580 --> 00:25:38.666 align:middle line:84%
And within two days, he was
throwing 95, 98 miles an hour

00:25:38.666 --> 00:25:39.920 align:middle line:90%
again.

00:25:39.920 --> 00:25:42.190 align:middle line:90%
And he's over 50.

00:25:42.190 --> 00:25:43.570 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Wow.

00:25:43.570 --> 00:25:45.780 align:middle line:84%
>>WILLS: Fox TV did
a thing on that.

00:25:45.780 --> 00:25:47.080 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: On that healing?

00:25:47.080 --> 00:25:49.087 align:middle line:84%
I mean, you've been
featured on TV a few times

00:25:49.087 --> 00:25:49.795 align:middle line:90%
doing this stuff.

00:25:49.795 --> 00:25:49.940 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:25:49.940 --> 00:25:50.523 align:middle line:90%
>>WILLS: Yeah.

00:25:50.523 --> 00:25:52.420 align:middle line:90%
Quite a few times.

00:25:52.420 --> 00:25:53.090 align:middle line:90%
You know.

00:25:53.090 --> 00:25:53.340 align:middle line:90%
There are--

00:25:53.340 --> 00:25:54.923 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So he
regained is abilities.

00:25:54.923 --> 00:25:56.681 align:middle line:90%
>>WILLS: Oh sure.

00:25:56.681 --> 00:25:57.180 align:middle line:90%
He did.

00:25:57.180 --> 00:25:58.970 align:middle line:90%
And he was very fast.

00:25:58.970 --> 00:26:01.540 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: What about one of
the people that wrote in,

00:26:01.540 --> 00:26:05.190 align:middle line:84%
a woman who said,
well, I wrote to Jerry,

00:26:05.190 --> 00:26:08.480 align:middle line:84%
and it took him days
to get back to me.

00:26:08.480 --> 00:26:12.870 align:middle line:84%
And when he finally did, he told
me he really couldn't help me,

00:26:12.870 --> 00:26:14.130 align:middle line:90%
and I was just so sad.

00:26:14.130 --> 00:26:15.810 align:middle line:90%
I was so disappointed.

00:26:15.810 --> 00:26:17.480 align:middle line:90%
It was my last resort.

00:26:17.480 --> 00:26:20.510 align:middle line:84%
I was so hoping that
he would help me.

00:26:20.510 --> 00:26:22.830 align:middle line:84%
And you responded directly
to her on that page.

00:26:22.830 --> 00:26:27.240 align:middle line:84%
Anybody can read that page
with our last interview.

00:26:27.240 --> 00:26:29.470 align:middle line:84%
And you said there was
actually more to that story.

00:26:29.470 --> 00:26:33.250 align:middle line:84%
So let's talk about that story
and some of those complexities.

00:26:33.250 --> 00:26:35.750 align:middle line:84%
>>WILLS: Well it was a very
long message that she sent,

00:26:35.750 --> 00:26:39.450 align:middle line:84%
with a long list of things
that were bothering her.

00:26:39.450 --> 00:26:41.367 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: The original
message she sent you?

00:26:41.367 --> 00:26:42.200 align:middle line:90%
>>WILLS: Personally.

00:26:42.200 --> 00:26:42.695 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Personally.

00:26:42.695 --> 00:26:44.236 align:middle line:84%
>>WILLS: Before
posted it onto Gaiam.

00:26:44.236 --> 00:26:46.810 align:middle line:90%


00:26:46.810 --> 00:26:50.490 align:middle line:84%
Out of everything she
wrote, the one thing

00:26:50.490 --> 00:26:55.270 align:middle line:84%
that I know because I've
been doing this awhile,

00:26:55.270 --> 00:26:57.500 align:middle line:84%
is there are some
things you have

00:26:57.500 --> 00:27:00.000 align:middle line:90%
to take care of for yourself.

00:27:00.000 --> 00:27:03.190 align:middle line:84%
And the one thing that was
of critical importance,

00:27:03.190 --> 00:27:07.120 align:middle line:84%
in my opinion, she had a
gallbladder issue with stones

00:27:07.120 --> 00:27:08.480 align:middle line:90%
the size of golf balls.

00:27:08.480 --> 00:27:09.344 align:middle line:90%
Well, that's huge.

00:27:09.344 --> 00:27:11.260 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: She needed you
to take care of that.

00:27:11.260 --> 00:27:12.801 align:middle line:84%
>>WILLS: That needed
to be taken care

00:27:12.801 --> 00:27:15.520 align:middle line:84%
of because it throws the
whole body into a bad place.

00:27:15.520 --> 00:27:19.410 align:middle line:90%
I know that really well.

00:27:19.410 --> 00:27:22.180 align:middle line:90%
So that was my advice.

00:27:22.180 --> 00:27:25.300 align:middle line:90%
Go take care of this.

00:27:25.300 --> 00:27:27.330 align:middle line:84%
I can't do anything
else to help you

00:27:27.330 --> 00:27:29.120 align:middle line:90%
until you take care of this.

00:27:29.120 --> 00:27:30.770 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And then,
was the implication

00:27:30.770 --> 00:27:33.500 align:middle line:84%
that if you take care
of this stem thing, then

00:27:33.500 --> 00:27:35.670 align:middle line:84%
I can help you with
the other things after?

00:27:35.670 --> 00:27:37.290 align:middle line:90%
>>WILLS: I said that I can try.

00:27:37.290 --> 00:27:37.350 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:27:37.350 --> 00:27:37.891 align:middle line:90%
And will try.

00:27:37.891 --> 00:27:38.840 align:middle line:90%
Yes, OK.

00:27:38.840 --> 00:27:41.990 align:middle line:84%
>>WILLS: And that
was what I wrote.

00:27:41.990 --> 00:27:44.102 align:middle line:84%
Well, and of course,
she posted it

00:27:44.102 --> 00:27:45.560 align:middle line:84%
and made it sound
like that I said,

00:27:45.560 --> 00:27:48.840 align:middle line:90%
well sorry, can't help you.

00:27:48.840 --> 00:27:51.200 align:middle line:90%
That wasn't true.

00:27:51.200 --> 00:27:54.212 align:middle line:84%
And I brought that
to her attention.

00:27:54.212 --> 00:27:55.670 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And I
think she has since

00:27:55.670 --> 00:27:58.600 align:middle line:90%
gotten some medical evaluation.

00:27:58.600 --> 00:28:00.780 align:middle line:84%
And they told her
the exact same thing.

00:28:00.780 --> 00:28:03.330 align:middle line:84%
They said, you have to
have this thing taken

00:28:03.330 --> 00:28:04.654 align:middle line:90%
care of immediately.

00:28:04.654 --> 00:28:05.320 align:middle line:90%
>>WILLS: Mm-hmm.

00:28:05.320 --> 00:28:06.150 align:middle line:90%
Because it's life-threatening.

00:28:06.150 --> 00:28:07.483 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: It's life-threatening.

00:28:07.483 --> 00:28:09.830 align:middle line:84%
And so she's now at a
point where she's saying,

00:28:09.830 --> 00:28:11.660 align:middle line:90%
OK, I get it.

00:28:11.660 --> 00:28:12.160 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:28:12.160 --> 00:28:13.991 align:middle line:90%
>>WILLS: Exactly.

00:28:13.991 --> 00:28:15.877 align:middle line:90%
And she's a lovely person.

00:28:15.877 --> 00:28:16.460 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:28:16.460 --> 00:28:16.720 align:middle line:90%
She is.

00:28:16.720 --> 00:28:17.630 align:middle line:90%
Very lovely lady.

00:28:17.630 --> 00:28:17.840 align:middle line:90%
>>WILLS: Yeah.

00:28:17.840 --> 00:28:18.550 align:middle line:90%
No problem there.

00:28:18.550 --> 00:28:19.490 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And she
was very grateful

00:28:19.490 --> 00:28:21.200 align:middle line:84%
that you wrote back
to her and so forth.

00:28:21.200 --> 00:28:24.930 align:middle line:84%
But she was afraid to take
care of the stem issue.

00:28:24.930 --> 00:28:27.030 align:middle line:84%
How often do you
find this in people

00:28:27.030 --> 00:28:32.030 align:middle line:84%
when you say, you know, you've
got to go and have this cut out

00:28:32.030 --> 00:28:32.620 align:middle line:90%
or whatever?

00:28:32.620 --> 00:28:34.570 align:middle line:84%
I mean, it happens
knowing-- I know

00:28:34.570 --> 00:28:36.640 align:middle line:84%
people's tumors shrink
and all, but aren't there

00:28:36.640 --> 00:28:39.640 align:middle line:84%
instances where they just
have to have it taken out?

00:28:39.640 --> 00:28:41.830 align:middle line:84%
>>WILLS: Well, I can tell
you a couple stories.

00:28:41.830 --> 00:28:46.320 align:middle line:84%
One of them is the gal that
came to see me with her mother.

00:28:46.320 --> 00:28:49.305 align:middle line:84%
The gal was a doctor, and
her mother, of course,

00:28:49.305 --> 00:28:50.580 align:middle line:90%
is her mother.

00:28:50.580 --> 00:28:54.600 align:middle line:84%
And I went to work on
her, to help her out.

00:28:54.600 --> 00:28:56.880 align:middle line:84%
She had a little
trouble breathing.

00:28:56.880 --> 00:28:58.900 align:middle line:84%
I was going to take
a look and see why.

00:28:58.900 --> 00:29:04.660 align:middle line:84%
So I just put my hand here,
just below towards her neck,

00:29:04.660 --> 00:29:06.290 align:middle line:90%
other hand on her back.

00:29:06.290 --> 00:29:07.617 align:middle line:90%
Took a look.

00:29:07.617 --> 00:29:08.450 align:middle line:90%
Pulled my hands off.

00:29:08.450 --> 00:29:11.650 align:middle line:84%
And I said, look,
don't get excited.

00:29:11.650 --> 00:29:13.630 align:middle line:90%
Just be relaxed.

00:29:13.630 --> 00:29:16.480 align:middle line:84%
I want you to go to the
hospital immediately.

00:29:16.480 --> 00:29:20.250 align:middle line:84%
Tell the doctors that there's
something terribly wrong

00:29:20.250 --> 00:29:21.560 align:middle line:90%
with your heart.

00:29:21.560 --> 00:29:23.950 align:middle line:84%
That there is going to be
an issue if they don't do

00:29:23.950 --> 00:29:26.080 align:middle line:90%
something about it immediately.

00:29:26.080 --> 00:29:27.780 align:middle line:90%
It's very dangerous.

00:29:27.780 --> 00:29:31.370 align:middle line:84%
Take a deep breath,
relax, go, and do it now.

00:29:31.370 --> 00:29:32.710 align:middle line:90%
Don't wait 10 minutes.

00:29:32.710 --> 00:29:34.330 align:middle line:90%
Don't wait a half an hour.

00:29:34.330 --> 00:29:37.090 align:middle line:84%
Go directly to the
hospital from here.

00:29:37.090 --> 00:29:38.430 align:middle line:90%
She did.

00:29:38.430 --> 00:29:40.680 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: How did her daughter,
the doctor, handle it?

00:29:40.680 --> 00:29:42.355 align:middle line:84%
>>WILLS: Well, she
was like, I'm on it.

00:29:42.355 --> 00:29:44.230 align:middle line:84%
Because I'd already
worked with her daughter.

00:29:44.230 --> 00:29:44.880 align:middle line:90%
She already--

00:29:44.880 --> 00:29:45.250 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: OK.

00:29:45.250 --> 00:29:46.070 align:middle line:84%
So she knew what you
could assist with.

00:29:46.070 --> 00:29:48.294 align:middle line:84%
>>WILLS: She knew
what that was about.

00:29:48.294 --> 00:29:48.960 align:middle line:90%
They went there.

00:29:48.960 --> 00:29:53.670 align:middle line:84%
They found out that a stent
that had been put in, there

00:29:53.670 --> 00:29:56.260 align:middle line:84%
were huge blood clots that
had formed inside of it,

00:29:56.260 --> 00:29:58.840 align:middle line:90%
and it was about to let loose.

00:29:58.840 --> 00:30:01.790 align:middle line:84%
And they were able
to save her life.

00:30:01.790 --> 00:30:06.350 align:middle line:84%
Another one was a fellow
that came to see me.

00:30:06.350 --> 00:30:10.750 align:middle line:84%
Slurring of the
speech, little off.

00:30:10.750 --> 00:30:13.140 align:middle line:90%
Hard to walk.

00:30:13.140 --> 00:30:14.450 align:middle line:90%
And I took a look.

00:30:14.450 --> 00:30:17.470 align:middle line:84%
I just went in and
looked inside his head.

00:30:17.470 --> 00:30:23.100 align:middle line:84%
And I said, you need to go
to the hospital immediately.

00:30:23.100 --> 00:30:26.570 align:middle line:84%
You have some foreign
object in your head.

00:30:26.570 --> 00:30:28.070 align:middle line:10%
Well, his wife's a
registered nurse.

00:30:28.070 --> 00:30:31.280 align:middle line:10%
She says, well, he
has a stent in there

00:30:31.280 --> 00:30:33.420 align:middle line:10%
because there's a
tumor, and there's

00:30:33.420 --> 00:30:38.910 align:middle line:10%
a place where the fluid drains
through the brain and so forth,

00:30:38.910 --> 00:30:45.170 align:middle line:10%
and they put that in there
because it wasn't draining.

00:30:45.170 --> 00:30:46.420 align:middle line:90%
Well, I told him.

00:30:46.420 --> 00:30:50.680 align:middle line:84%
I said, this was put in upside
down, and I think backwards.

00:30:50.680 --> 00:30:52.430 align:middle line:84%
Not that I know how
it's supposed to look,

00:30:52.430 --> 00:30:54.500 align:middle line:84%
but that's just what
came out of my mouth.

00:30:54.500 --> 00:30:56.730 align:middle line:84%
I said, you need to go to
the hospital right now.

00:30:56.730 --> 00:30:58.630 align:middle line:90%
This is life or death.

00:30:58.630 --> 00:31:02.830 align:middle line:84%
Get a brain surgeon, have
him take a look, fix this.

00:31:02.830 --> 00:31:03.470 align:middle line:90%
They went.

00:31:03.470 --> 00:31:04.880 align:middle line:90%
Sure enough, that was the issue.

00:31:04.880 --> 00:31:07.490 align:middle line:90%


00:31:07.490 --> 00:31:10.610 align:middle line:84%
This is one that Fox did
a special on as well.

00:31:10.610 --> 00:31:13.920 align:middle line:84%
And as it turns out, I was
called over to the hospital

00:31:13.920 --> 00:31:16.710 align:middle line:84%
because nothing they
would do was working.

00:31:16.710 --> 00:31:20.240 align:middle line:84%
So I had a conversation
with the brain surgeon

00:31:20.240 --> 00:31:22.820 align:middle line:84%
and said, well, where it
has been placed really

00:31:22.820 --> 00:31:25.170 align:middle line:90%
isn't where it should be.

00:31:25.170 --> 00:31:28.720 align:middle line:84%
And I gave him
some of my advice.

00:31:28.720 --> 00:31:30.260 align:middle line:90%
And who am I to do this, really?

00:31:30.260 --> 00:31:35.180 align:middle line:84%
But I said, here's how
I see it would work.

00:31:35.180 --> 00:31:35.770 align:middle line:90%
He did.

00:31:35.770 --> 00:31:37.970 align:middle line:90%
It worked.

00:31:37.970 --> 00:31:41.310 align:middle line:84%
When Fox did the special,
now that he was out

00:31:41.310 --> 00:31:43.520 align:middle line:84%
of life-threatening
danger, they had

00:31:43.520 --> 00:31:45.390 align:middle line:84%
me do a reenactment
of me working on him.

00:31:45.390 --> 00:31:46.640 align:middle line:90%
Well, it wasn't a reenactment.

00:31:46.640 --> 00:31:47.895 align:middle line:90%
I actually was.

00:31:47.895 --> 00:31:52.400 align:middle line:84%
And I found the tumor,
went to work on it.

00:31:52.400 --> 00:31:54.150 align:middle line:90%
It was an inoperable.

00:31:54.150 --> 00:31:56.510 align:middle line:84%
There was nothing they
could do about it.

00:31:56.510 --> 00:31:58.640 align:middle line:90%
They said, give us a few months.

00:31:58.640 --> 00:32:00.860 align:middle line:90%
I'll check in on you.

00:32:00.860 --> 00:32:03.210 align:middle line:84%
A few months later,
there was no tumor.

00:32:03.210 --> 00:32:06.490 align:middle line:84%
There was no need for the
stent and the drainage.

00:32:06.490 --> 00:32:08.546 align:middle line:90%
He was fine.

00:32:08.546 --> 00:32:09.420 align:middle line:90%
He's with his family.

00:32:09.420 --> 00:32:12.450 align:middle line:90%


00:32:12.450 --> 00:32:14.844 align:middle line:84%
Those are examples of when
I see something wrong,

00:32:14.844 --> 00:32:15.510 align:middle line:90%
and I tell them.

00:32:15.510 --> 00:32:16.870 align:middle line:90%
People say, oh well, you--

00:32:16.870 --> 00:32:17.786 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Just fix it.

00:32:17.786 --> 00:32:18.790 align:middle line:90%
Right?

00:32:18.790 --> 00:32:21.030 align:middle line:90%
>>WILLS: Just fix it.

00:32:21.030 --> 00:32:23.380 align:middle line:90%
Or I don't trust doctors at all.

00:32:23.380 --> 00:32:25.150 align:middle line:90%
That's stupid.

00:32:25.150 --> 00:32:29.970 align:middle line:84%
Just because you don't
agree with some of the way

00:32:29.970 --> 00:32:33.300 align:middle line:84%
they do things doesn't
mean that doctors are bad.

00:32:33.300 --> 00:32:36.480 align:middle line:84%
Doctors have a
place in all this.

00:32:36.480 --> 00:32:40.270 align:middle line:84%
They do what they do, and
they do it quite well.

00:32:40.270 --> 00:32:42.910 align:middle line:84%
We might not like their
prices, and we might not

00:32:42.910 --> 00:32:46.120 align:middle line:90%
like their aloofness.

00:32:46.120 --> 00:32:50.040 align:middle line:84%
But they are the technicians,
the mechanics really.

00:32:50.040 --> 00:32:52.700 align:middle line:84%
And they know what
they're doing.

00:32:52.700 --> 00:32:55.570 align:middle line:84%
I think the future of medicine
is going to incorporate both

00:32:55.570 --> 00:32:57.797 align:middle line:90%
what I do and what they do.

00:32:57.797 --> 00:32:58.880 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes, let's hope.

00:32:58.880 --> 00:33:00.684 align:middle line:90%
That makes perfect sense.

00:33:00.684 --> 00:33:02.100 align:middle line:84%
Until we get to
the point where we

00:33:02.100 --> 00:33:04.420 align:middle line:84%
can learn not to manifest
these things to begin with,

00:33:04.420 --> 00:33:05.670 align:middle line:90%
which could be a little while.

00:33:05.670 --> 00:33:07.430 align:middle line:90%
Part of the human condition.

00:33:07.430 --> 00:33:10.230 align:middle line:84%
So one of the things
I wonder about

00:33:10.230 --> 00:33:15.030 align:middle line:84%
is where you have kind
of anomalous expressions

00:33:15.030 --> 00:33:16.710 align:middle line:90%
of illness.

00:33:16.710 --> 00:33:20.670 align:middle line:84%
Because we tend to think that
we're mechanistic in nature.

00:33:20.670 --> 00:33:22.320 align:middle line:90%
This chemical goes this way.

00:33:22.320 --> 00:33:23.650 align:middle line:90%
This signal goes that way.

00:33:23.650 --> 00:33:25.490 align:middle line:90%
This is connected to that.

00:33:25.490 --> 00:33:31.160 align:middle line:84%
But in truth, do you see
a wide kind of variances

00:33:31.160 --> 00:33:33.820 align:middle line:84%
in what people look like
and how their bodies go

00:33:33.820 --> 00:33:36.680 align:middle line:90%
through the task of healing?

00:33:36.680 --> 00:33:37.460 align:middle line:90%
>>WILLS: I do.

00:33:37.460 --> 00:33:42.170 align:middle line:84%
Everyone goes into a healing
process in their own way.

00:33:42.170 --> 00:33:46.240 align:middle line:90%
There isn't any one set path.

00:33:46.240 --> 00:33:50.720 align:middle line:84%
If you're looking at a torn
muscle or a torn ligament

00:33:50.720 --> 00:33:52.240 align:middle line:84%
or something, there
is a path where

00:33:52.240 --> 00:33:53.650 align:middle line:90%
it goes a certain direction.

00:33:53.650 --> 00:33:55.610 align:middle line:84%
It's pretty much the
same for everyone.

00:33:55.610 --> 00:33:59.780 align:middle line:84%
But how well it heals one
person to the next is different.

00:33:59.780 --> 00:34:04.080 align:middle line:84%
What I try to do is improve that
when I work with the person.

00:34:04.080 --> 00:34:06.680 align:middle line:84%
Sometimes it's instantaneous,
and other times, it

00:34:06.680 --> 00:34:08.780 align:middle line:90%
takes a little while.

00:34:08.780 --> 00:34:13.190 align:middle line:84%
And like I tell everyone,
I can't fix everybody.

00:34:13.190 --> 00:34:17.679 align:middle line:84%
I try, but it doesn't
work for every person.

00:34:17.679 --> 00:34:21.429 align:middle line:84%
But the healing
process, it's totally

00:34:21.429 --> 00:34:27.300 align:middle line:84%
dependent upon the raw
materials, what's there.

00:34:27.300 --> 00:34:32.552 align:middle line:84%
In very few cases,
I've had to pull it

00:34:32.552 --> 00:34:34.260 align:middle line:84%
from different parts
of the body in order

00:34:34.260 --> 00:34:37.216 align:middle line:90%
to get things to heal properly.

00:34:37.216 --> 00:34:39.340 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: What are some of
the basic raw materials?

00:34:39.340 --> 00:34:42.300 align:middle line:84%
Because I want to get
into how we can begin

00:34:42.300 --> 00:34:45.480 align:middle line:84%
facilitating these things
in ourselves and each other

00:34:45.480 --> 00:34:47.989 align:middle line:90%
as humans.

00:34:47.989 --> 00:34:51.409 align:middle line:84%
And what are some of
the basic raw materials

00:34:51.409 --> 00:34:53.690 align:middle line:84%
that we seem to
chronically be missing,

00:34:53.690 --> 00:34:58.790 align:middle line:84%
or we can benefit from to help
our own healing processes?

00:34:58.790 --> 00:35:02.920 align:middle line:84%
>>WILLS: Well, it's everything
that the body is composed of.

00:35:02.920 --> 00:35:06.170 align:middle line:90%


00:35:06.170 --> 00:35:07.380 align:middle line:90%
What is the--

00:35:07.380 --> 00:35:10.030 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Are you seeing some
common deficiencies, though?

00:35:10.030 --> 00:35:11.654 align:middle line:84%
>>WILLS: There are
common deficiencies.

00:35:11.654 --> 00:35:15.430 align:middle line:84%
And mostly, it has to do with
nutrition and mineralization.

00:35:15.430 --> 00:35:21.620 align:middle line:84%
And most people need to have
more of all the minerals.

00:35:21.620 --> 00:35:23.140 align:middle line:90%
That's an issue.

00:35:23.140 --> 00:35:26.705 align:middle line:84%
Their nutrition
is maybe lacking.

00:35:26.705 --> 00:35:30.610 align:middle line:90%


00:35:30.610 --> 00:35:34.460 align:middle line:84%
These sort of things are
common with everyone.

00:35:34.460 --> 00:35:37.620 align:middle line:84%
And even if you're trying to
use, let's say, for example,

00:35:37.620 --> 00:35:39.300 align:middle line:84%
you're using all
the right things.

00:35:39.300 --> 00:35:43.310 align:middle line:90%


00:35:43.310 --> 00:35:46.280 align:middle line:84%
If you're not doing it
on a consistent basis,

00:35:46.280 --> 00:35:49.360 align:middle line:84%
your body uses it up,
and it becomes exhausted.

00:35:49.360 --> 00:35:54.010 align:middle line:84%
So you have to just continually
put the right things in.

00:35:54.010 --> 00:35:56.750 align:middle line:90%
It's as important as breathing.

00:35:56.750 --> 00:35:58.800 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So if you're
doing a fix on someone,

00:35:58.800 --> 00:36:00.960 align:middle line:84%
and their body's
deficient, you just

00:36:00.960 --> 00:36:03.630 align:middle line:84%
mentioned you have to pull
it from somewhere else.

00:36:03.630 --> 00:36:05.660 align:middle line:90%
What's that look like?

00:36:05.660 --> 00:36:07.525 align:middle line:84%
>>WILLS: Well, it
looks like energy.

00:36:07.525 --> 00:36:11.600 align:middle line:90%


00:36:11.600 --> 00:36:17.850 align:middle line:84%
It is pulling bits and
pieces from the femur or--

00:36:17.850 --> 00:36:19.260 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Some nutrients.

00:36:19.260 --> 00:36:20.362 align:middle line:90%
Minerals or whatever.

00:36:20.362 --> 00:36:22.070 align:middle line:84%
>>WILLS: Just things,
pulling it through.

00:36:22.070 --> 00:36:26.730 align:middle line:84%
There was a gal that
I worked on-- gosh,

00:36:26.730 --> 00:36:32.090 align:middle line:84%
it's been a few weeks--
that was lacking

00:36:32.090 --> 00:36:39.250 align:middle line:84%
so badly that I just transferred
some of mine into her.

00:36:39.250 --> 00:36:42.862 align:middle line:84%
Just sent energy in, carrying
this in an energetic form.

00:36:42.862 --> 00:36:43.570 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Mm-hmm.

00:36:43.570 --> 00:36:44.165 align:middle line:90%
Those frequencies.

00:36:44.165 --> 00:36:44.664 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:36:44.664 --> 00:36:45.740 align:middle line:90%
>>WILLS: And it helped.

00:36:45.740 --> 00:36:48.580 align:middle line:90%


00:36:48.580 --> 00:36:51.714 align:middle line:84%
But it's the sort of thing that
I don't like doing very often.

00:36:51.714 --> 00:36:52.380 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:36:52.380 --> 00:36:53.300 align:middle line:90%
Of course.

00:36:53.300 --> 00:36:55.342 align:middle line:84%
Well, OK, I have a
specific one to ask you

00:36:55.342 --> 00:36:57.660 align:middle line:84%
about because I've
heard you notice

00:36:57.660 --> 00:37:00.414 align:middle line:84%
that it could be beneficial
in a couple of cases.

00:37:00.414 --> 00:37:02.330 align:middle line:84%
It's something we don't
hear about very often.

00:37:02.330 --> 00:37:04.750 align:middle line:90%
It's boron.

00:37:04.750 --> 00:37:07.260 align:middle line:84%
>>WILLS: Well, the way
it was explained to me

00:37:07.260 --> 00:37:11.630 align:middle line:84%
is boron is an
essential mineral.

00:37:11.630 --> 00:37:16.020 align:middle line:84%
If you take a look at-- and
I haven't looked into this,

00:37:16.020 --> 00:37:17.562 align:middle line:90%
so I can't attest to it.

00:37:17.562 --> 00:37:19.550 align:middle line:84%
But I'm just repeating
what I was told.

00:37:19.550 --> 00:37:23.750 align:middle line:84%
The folks in the Middle
East, for example,

00:37:23.750 --> 00:37:28.500 align:middle line:84%
they don't have issues
with joint disease.

00:37:28.500 --> 00:37:32.800 align:middle line:84%
And it was a real curiosity
according to this doctor

00:37:32.800 --> 00:37:37.710 align:middle line:84%
until they discovered that
their water was rich in boron.

00:37:37.710 --> 00:37:40.920 align:middle line:84%
So he started suggesting
people use boron.

00:37:40.920 --> 00:37:43.840 align:middle line:84%
And as they did, a lot
of the joint disease

00:37:43.840 --> 00:37:45.770 align:middle line:90%
started to just fade away.

00:37:45.770 --> 00:37:47.040 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Interesting.

00:37:47.040 --> 00:37:48.850 align:middle line:84%
Would this help with
arthritic conditions?

00:37:48.850 --> 00:37:50.760 align:middle line:90%
>>WILLS: Well, according to him.

00:37:50.760 --> 00:37:51.840 align:middle line:90%
I've not tried it.

00:37:51.840 --> 00:37:53.970 align:middle line:84%
Of course, I haven't had
any arthritic conditions.

00:37:53.970 --> 00:37:58.770 align:middle line:84%
But I do know that if you
take boron, too much of it--

00:37:58.770 --> 00:38:01.190 align:middle line:84%
because what I do is when
someone suggests something,

00:38:01.190 --> 00:38:03.020 align:middle line:90%
I'll use it.

00:38:03.020 --> 00:38:06.150 align:middle line:84%
And most people make
the mistake of thinking

00:38:06.150 --> 00:38:08.990 align:middle line:84%
if a little as good,
a lot is better.

00:38:08.990 --> 00:38:10.945 align:middle line:84%
I guarantee it's not
the case with boron.

00:38:10.945 --> 00:38:13.070 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: What happens if
you have the right amount

00:38:13.070 --> 00:38:14.130 align:middle line:90%
versus too much?

00:38:14.130 --> 00:38:16.620 align:middle line:84%
>>WILLS: The right amount,
you don't notice it.

00:38:16.620 --> 00:38:19.540 align:middle line:84%
Too much, it feels
like searing hot nails

00:38:19.540 --> 00:38:20.770 align:middle line:90%
driven into your head.

00:38:20.770 --> 00:38:22.020 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: [LAUGHING] Goodness.

00:38:22.020 --> 00:38:26.010 align:middle line:84%
>>WILLS: And it hurts
really bad for a while.

00:38:26.010 --> 00:38:28.320 align:middle line:84%
Taking too much boron
is not a good idea.

00:38:28.320 --> 00:38:28.862 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: OK.

00:38:28.862 --> 00:38:30.236 align:middle line:84%
I just brought it
up because it's

00:38:30.236 --> 00:38:31.420 align:middle line:90%
one of the more exotic ones.

00:38:31.420 --> 00:38:34.130 align:middle line:84%
Another one I've heard
you mention-- in fact, you

00:38:34.130 --> 00:38:38.260 align:middle line:84%
mentioned it to me-- was
iodine, but a very specific kind

00:38:38.260 --> 00:38:38.940 align:middle line:90%
of iodine.

00:38:38.940 --> 00:38:42.090 align:middle line:84%
And I know Patrick
Flanagan is really

00:38:42.090 --> 00:38:45.100 align:middle line:84%
big on iodine
supplementation as well.

00:38:45.100 --> 00:38:48.930 align:middle line:84%
And for him, it
becomes a lot from-- he

00:38:48.930 --> 00:38:51.980 align:middle line:84%
does a lot of
readings of radiation

00:38:51.980 --> 00:38:54.214 align:middle line:84%
exposure around the
planet, saying that we just

00:38:54.214 --> 00:38:55.630 align:middle line:84%
have a little bit
too much of that

00:38:55.630 --> 00:38:57.650 align:middle line:84%
going on for our own
good in the thyroid.

00:38:57.650 --> 00:39:00.280 align:middle line:90%
>>WILLS: Well, that's true.

00:39:00.280 --> 00:39:03.325 align:middle line:84%
There's a doctor's name
whose name is Jorge Flechas.

00:39:03.325 --> 00:39:06.680 align:middle line:84%
He's one of the world's
leading experts on iodine.

00:39:06.680 --> 00:39:09.850 align:middle line:84%
He worked with Dr.
Brownstein, who is probably

00:39:09.850 --> 00:39:12.490 align:middle line:90%
the world's leading expert.

00:39:12.490 --> 00:39:17.470 align:middle line:84%
Anyway, it is such that
when you use iodine,

00:39:17.470 --> 00:39:20.600 align:middle line:84%
it feeds all the
cells of the body.

00:39:20.600 --> 00:39:22.880 align:middle line:84%
Now, most people think
iodine goes to the thyroid.

00:39:22.880 --> 00:39:25.290 align:middle line:84%
And what they're suggesting
is that-- what is it,

00:39:25.290 --> 00:39:30.290 align:middle line:84%
64.7 milligrams per day
was the optimum amount?

00:39:30.290 --> 00:39:36.750 align:middle line:84%
So 50 milligrams a day would
be close enough to do the job.

00:39:36.750 --> 00:39:39.720 align:middle line:84%
In order for iodine
to not just go

00:39:39.720 --> 00:39:41.819 align:middle line:84%
to the thyroid-- in other
words, you take iodine,

00:39:41.819 --> 00:39:44.360 align:middle line:84%
it's going to hit the thyroid
and be flushed out of the body.

00:39:44.360 --> 00:39:48.320 align:middle line:84%
It circulates through,
as I understand it.

00:39:48.320 --> 00:39:54.960 align:middle line:84%
Well, when taking iodine with
something called ATP cofactors,

00:39:54.960 --> 00:39:57.334 align:middle line:84%
which is really
vitamin B2 and B3.

00:39:57.334 --> 00:39:58.250 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah, right.

00:39:58.250 --> 00:40:02.641 align:middle line:84%
>>WILLS: 100 milligrams of
B2, 500 milligrams of B3.

00:40:02.641 --> 00:40:04.890 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And Patrick's--
he's really big on that too,

00:40:04.890 --> 00:40:05.810 align:middle line:90%
like you are.

00:40:05.810 --> 00:40:07.640 align:middle line:84%
>>WILLS: B3 is
niacin, so you want

00:40:07.640 --> 00:40:11.440 align:middle line:84%
to use an inositol
hexanicotinate, which

00:40:11.440 --> 00:40:13.770 align:middle line:90%
is a no-flush niacin.

00:40:13.770 --> 00:40:16.510 align:middle line:90%
But it's 100, 500.

00:40:16.510 --> 00:40:18.390 align:middle line:84%
Well you use this,
and what happens

00:40:18.390 --> 00:40:21.820 align:middle line:84%
is that the iodine can now
connect to the red blood cells,

00:40:21.820 --> 00:40:24.700 align:middle line:84%
and it'll move
through your body.

00:40:24.700 --> 00:40:27.110 align:middle line:84%
If you get too much,
it's going to be stored

00:40:27.110 --> 00:40:30.020 align:middle line:90%
in a special area of the brain.

00:40:30.020 --> 00:40:33.841 align:middle line:84%
Now, this information was
given to me by Dr. Flechas,

00:40:33.841 --> 00:40:35.590 align:middle line:84%
and I've seen evidence
of this when I've--

00:40:35.590 --> 00:40:37.740 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: What happens when
it gets stored in the brain?

00:40:37.740 --> 00:40:40.198 align:middle line:84%
>>WILLS: Well, it's a magical
thing because it stays there.

00:40:40.198 --> 00:40:45.960 align:middle line:84%
Now imagine if you were to
get some kind of an injury.

00:40:45.960 --> 00:40:47.960 align:middle line:84%
Well, the iodine
would be pumped down

00:40:47.960 --> 00:40:50.100 align:middle line:90%
through your nervous system.

00:40:50.100 --> 00:40:53.000 align:middle line:84%
In an injury like neck,
like whiplash-- something,

00:40:53.000 --> 00:40:55.400 align:middle line:84%
pinched nerve, iodine
gets pumped down

00:40:55.400 --> 00:40:57.580 align:middle line:90%
through the nervous system.

00:40:57.580 --> 00:41:01.480 align:middle line:84%
Iodine inhibits the
formation of scar tissue.

00:41:01.480 --> 00:41:05.400 align:middle line:84%
And according to Dr.
Flechas, his patients

00:41:05.400 --> 00:41:10.230 align:middle line:84%
use iodine in order to
overwhelm fibrocystic breast

00:41:10.230 --> 00:41:16.620 align:middle line:84%
disease, fibromyalgia, and a
whole list of other issues.

00:41:16.620 --> 00:41:19.500 align:middle line:84%
So when I run into this,
I put them in touch

00:41:19.500 --> 00:41:22.139 align:middle line:84%
with Dr. Flechas
research and let them

00:41:22.139 --> 00:41:23.430 align:middle line:90%
make a decision for themselves.

00:41:23.430 --> 00:41:24.320 align:middle line:90%
Is it good for you?

00:41:24.320 --> 00:41:26.954 align:middle line:84%
I don't know but
read this and see.

00:41:26.954 --> 00:41:27.620 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:41:27.620 --> 00:41:29.250 align:middle line:84%
Yeah, because it's
so controversial,

00:41:29.250 --> 00:41:31.180 align:middle line:84%
whether you get too
much or too little.

00:41:31.180 --> 00:41:33.672 align:middle line:84%
But the type of iodine
matters as well.

00:41:33.672 --> 00:41:34.630 align:middle line:90%
>>WILLS: Well, exactly.

00:41:34.630 --> 00:41:38.560 align:middle line:84%
And it needs to be the
mineral form of iodine.

00:41:38.560 --> 00:41:40.560 align:middle line:84%
There's a really
good source for it.

00:41:40.560 --> 00:41:44.310 align:middle line:90%
You can find it on the internet.

00:41:44.310 --> 00:41:49.371 align:middle line:84%
But there's one source that
we found that is fantastic.

00:41:49.371 --> 00:41:49.870 align:middle line:90%
The best.

00:41:49.870 --> 00:41:53.300 align:middle line:84%
And we've ordered lots
from different resources.

00:41:53.300 --> 00:41:56.729 align:middle line:10%
The one we found is
from naturodoc.com.

00:41:56.729 --> 00:41:58.270 align:middle line:10%
And that's
N-A-T-U-R-O-D-O-C dot com.

00:41:58.270 --> 00:42:01.945 align:middle line:90%


00:42:01.945 --> 00:42:05.460 align:middle line:84%
The fellow that makes it is
actually a friend of ours.

00:42:05.460 --> 00:42:07.590 align:middle line:90%
His name is Dr. Thomas Lee.

00:42:07.590 --> 00:42:09.510 align:middle line:90%
He's a naturopathic doctor.

00:42:09.510 --> 00:42:13.030 align:middle line:84%
And his stuff is like
the best I've ever used.

00:42:13.030 --> 00:42:15.230 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And is
that called Lugol's?

00:42:15.230 --> 00:42:17.260 align:middle line:90%
>>WILLS: Lugol's 5% Solution.

00:42:17.260 --> 00:42:18.810 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Lugol's 5% Solution.

00:42:18.810 --> 00:42:21.312 align:middle line:84%
I noticed some of them have
potassium at 10% with it.

00:42:21.312 --> 00:42:22.020 align:middle line:90%
>>WILLS: They do.

00:42:22.020 --> 00:42:22.645 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:42:22.645 --> 00:42:23.160 align:middle line:90%
That's OK?

00:42:23.160 --> 00:42:23.920 align:middle line:90%
That's cool.

00:42:23.920 --> 00:42:24.640 align:middle line:90%
>>WILLS: Yeah, that's fine.

00:42:24.640 --> 00:42:24.920 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: OK.

00:42:24.920 --> 00:42:25.420 align:middle line:90%
Good.

00:42:25.420 --> 00:42:28.620 align:middle line:84%
Well, that's a nice little
resource for us to have.

00:42:28.620 --> 00:42:29.120 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:42:29.120 --> 00:42:33.190 align:middle line:84%
Now let's get back to
humans healing humans.

00:42:33.190 --> 00:42:37.170 align:middle line:84%
And OK, we've already realized
that part of it is our fear.

00:42:37.170 --> 00:42:38.460 align:middle line:90%
That we think we can't do it.

00:42:38.460 --> 00:42:38.740 align:middle line:90%
That we're responsible--

00:42:38.740 --> 00:42:40.680 align:middle line:84%
>>WILLS: Well,
fear or inadequacy.

00:42:40.680 --> 00:42:41.770 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Or inadequacy.

00:42:41.770 --> 00:42:44.990 align:middle line:84%
Fear that we're wrong, good
enough, not good enough, and so

00:42:44.990 --> 00:42:45.900 align:middle line:90%
forth.

00:42:45.900 --> 00:42:49.900 align:middle line:84%
So once we realize, hey,
this is our birthright,

00:42:49.900 --> 00:42:53.160 align:middle line:84%
everybody has this
capacity to do

00:42:53.160 --> 00:42:55.970 align:middle line:84%
this, if not impeded
by something else,

00:42:55.970 --> 00:42:57.560 align:middle line:90%
or is that even true?

00:42:57.560 --> 00:43:00.960 align:middle line:84%
Are there some people
that simply maybe they

00:43:00.960 --> 00:43:04.710 align:middle line:84%
want to heal others but
aren't really wired to do so?

00:43:04.710 --> 00:43:06.360 align:middle line:90%
Not their dharma or whatnot?

00:43:06.360 --> 00:43:09.070 align:middle line:84%
I mean, is it fair to say it's
everyone's birthright to heal

00:43:09.070 --> 00:43:10.330 align:middle line:90%
themselves and one another?

00:43:10.330 --> 00:43:12.496 align:middle line:84%
>>WILLS: I think that it's
everyone's responsibility

00:43:12.496 --> 00:43:13.334 align:middle line:90%
to know how to.

00:43:13.334 --> 00:43:14.750 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Yeah, I
agree with that.

00:43:14.750 --> 00:43:16.720 align:middle line:84%
>>WILLS: Whether
you're proficient,

00:43:16.720 --> 00:43:21.160 align:middle line:84%
can do what I do, or do what--
someone's just trying to do it.

00:43:21.160 --> 00:43:26.130 align:middle line:84%
It's that act of caring
that distinguishes us.

00:43:26.130 --> 00:43:32.610 align:middle line:84%
And when you want to
do this sort of thing,

00:43:32.610 --> 00:43:34.480 align:middle line:90%
there's a language.

00:43:34.480 --> 00:43:36.720 align:middle line:84%
And the language is very
important, because there

00:43:36.720 --> 00:43:38.920 align:middle line:84%
are a lot of people
watching right now,

00:43:38.920 --> 00:43:41.930 align:middle line:84%
who are saying I
want to be a healer,

00:43:41.930 --> 00:43:44.300 align:middle line:90%
and someday, I will be a healer.

00:43:44.300 --> 00:43:48.150 align:middle line:84%
You want to be, but
you'll never be a healer.

00:43:48.150 --> 00:43:50.420 align:middle line:84%
And the reason is because
it isn't something

00:43:50.420 --> 00:43:53.410 align:middle line:90%
that you want to be.

00:43:53.410 --> 00:43:56.000 align:middle line:90%
The language is basically this.

00:43:56.000 --> 00:43:58.370 align:middle line:90%
You either are or you aren't.

00:43:58.370 --> 00:44:03.130 align:middle line:84%
If you are, then embrace it and
start acting as though you are.

00:44:03.130 --> 00:44:06.540 align:middle line:84%
The successes and failures
don't belong to you

00:44:06.540 --> 00:44:08.870 align:middle line:84%
so don't worry
about that anymore.

00:44:08.870 --> 00:44:11.320 align:middle line:84%
The act of love,
caring, compassion

00:44:11.320 --> 00:44:13.360 align:middle line:84%
the effort you
put into it, those

00:44:13.360 --> 00:44:15.570 align:middle line:90%
are the important factors.

00:44:15.570 --> 00:44:20.370 align:middle line:84%
That there's a person who was
in pain or afraid or hurt,

00:44:20.370 --> 00:44:25.800 align:middle line:84%
and you walk up to them and
try to ease how they feel.

00:44:25.800 --> 00:44:30.750 align:middle line:84%
The first order of business
for anyone who's a healer

00:44:30.750 --> 00:44:32.298 align:middle line:90%
is to establish peace.

00:44:32.298 --> 00:44:35.427 align:middle line:90%


00:44:35.427 --> 00:44:37.135 align:middle line:84%
And beyond that, all
things are possible.

00:44:37.135 --> 00:44:39.830 align:middle line:90%


00:44:39.830 --> 00:44:44.670 align:middle line:84%
The fact you would go up and
just go, I can hold your hands.

00:44:44.670 --> 00:44:45.930 align:middle line:90%
That's all I can do.

00:44:45.930 --> 00:44:48.850 align:middle line:84%
And I can say a
prayer to whatever god

00:44:48.850 --> 00:44:51.960 align:middle line:90%
you might believe in.

00:44:51.960 --> 00:44:55.930 align:middle line:90%
But you're not alone with this.

00:44:55.930 --> 00:45:00.760 align:middle line:84%
That is establishing a
state of being called peace,

00:45:00.760 --> 00:45:03.990 align:middle line:90%
where all things can happen.

00:45:03.990 --> 00:45:07.510 align:middle line:84%
It is something we should
all do for each other.

00:45:07.510 --> 00:45:10.270 align:middle line:90%
It's the fact that we can care.

00:45:10.270 --> 00:45:15.510 align:middle line:84%
And the thing that's sad
is that we might care,

00:45:15.510 --> 00:45:19.870 align:middle line:84%
but we don't respond
to the events the way

00:45:19.870 --> 00:45:23.780 align:middle line:84%
that we could
otherwise respond to.

00:45:23.780 --> 00:45:25.930 align:middle line:90%
Just be who you are.

00:45:25.930 --> 00:45:29.030 align:middle line:84%
Don't try to be
something you aren't.

00:45:29.030 --> 00:45:31.871 align:middle line:84%
Don't worry about
trying to cover yourself

00:45:31.871 --> 00:45:32.745 align:middle line:90%
with the white light.

00:45:32.745 --> 00:45:35.840 align:middle line:90%


00:45:35.840 --> 00:45:38.700 align:middle line:84%
If there's anything
to be afraid of,

00:45:38.700 --> 00:45:40.800 align:middle line:84%
it isn't about
protecting yourself

00:45:40.800 --> 00:45:43.666 align:middle line:90%
from this, whatever it is.

00:45:43.666 --> 00:45:44.790 align:middle line:90%
There isn't any protection.

00:45:44.790 --> 00:45:47.730 align:middle line:90%
God lives here first.

00:45:47.730 --> 00:45:50.780 align:middle line:90%
And everything comes from God.

00:45:50.780 --> 00:45:53.090 align:middle line:84%
And if you're trying to
pull in the white light,

00:45:53.090 --> 00:45:56.480 align:middle line:84%
what light is it that
you're trying to pull?

00:45:56.480 --> 00:45:58.790 align:middle line:84%
Or the purple flame or
whatever you're trying to pull?

00:45:58.790 --> 00:46:01.760 align:middle line:90%


00:46:01.760 --> 00:46:04.770 align:middle line:90%
No, it's not that.

00:46:04.770 --> 00:46:07.760 align:middle line:90%
You are the light.

00:46:07.760 --> 00:46:10.860 align:middle line:90%
You're the light.

00:46:10.860 --> 00:46:15.480 align:middle line:84%
Embrace that idea and
become what you already are,

00:46:15.480 --> 00:46:18.850 align:middle line:84%
the presence of God
manifest before me.

00:46:18.850 --> 00:46:19.980 align:middle line:90%
Let your light shine.

00:46:19.980 --> 00:46:22.190 align:middle line:84%
You don't have to pull
it somewhere else.

00:46:22.190 --> 00:46:26.060 align:middle line:90%
Let it emit from you.

00:46:26.060 --> 00:46:29.150 align:middle line:90%
Become the light.

00:46:29.150 --> 00:46:34.480 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And so the notion
that you have to be able to scan

00:46:34.480 --> 00:46:37.460 align:middle line:84%
and view, see what's going
on, and make an assessment,

00:46:37.460 --> 00:46:41.550 align:middle line:84%
and set your intention
to fix a specific thing,

00:46:41.550 --> 00:46:42.800 align:middle line:90%
is not necessary--

00:46:42.800 --> 00:46:43.440 align:middle line:90%
>>WILLS: All technical stuff.

00:46:43.440 --> 00:46:44.898 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: It's not
necessary if you

00:46:44.898 --> 00:46:48.440 align:middle line:84%
establish that peace
and caring and rapport

00:46:48.440 --> 00:46:54.040 align:middle line:84%
and simply intention to share
energy light and be of service?

00:46:54.040 --> 00:46:57.620 align:middle line:84%
>>WILLS: Yeah, that's just
making it all too complicated.

00:46:57.620 --> 00:46:58.540 align:middle line:90%
I do all this.

00:46:58.540 --> 00:47:02.160 align:middle line:84%
I look inside to see the things
I can see because I can see it.

00:47:02.160 --> 00:47:02.840 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:47:02.840 --> 00:47:04.230 align:middle line:90%
>>WILLS: And it's fun.

00:47:04.230 --> 00:47:06.910 align:middle line:84%
If I can see this or
that, that's entertaining.

00:47:06.910 --> 00:47:09.839 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: You read someone-- you
did a session on someone I know

00:47:09.839 --> 00:47:11.755 align:middle line:84%
recently, and she'd
totally forgotten that she

00:47:11.755 --> 00:47:12.820 align:middle line:90%
had injured that thing.

00:47:12.820 --> 00:47:14.700 align:middle line:84%
Years and years ago,
she was having problems.

00:47:14.700 --> 00:47:15.232 align:middle line:90%
Oh my god.

00:47:15.232 --> 00:47:15.940 align:middle line:90%
You can see that.

00:47:15.940 --> 00:47:17.060 align:middle line:90%
I forgot about it.

00:47:17.060 --> 00:47:19.210 align:middle line:84%
You have pretty good
x-ray vision that way.

00:47:19.210 --> 00:47:20.196 align:middle line:90%
>>WILLS: Yeah.

00:47:20.196 --> 00:47:21.570 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: But for
the rest of us,

00:47:21.570 --> 00:47:24.089 align:middle line:84%
let's say we're not
capable of doing that--

00:47:24.089 --> 00:47:25.255 align:middle line:90%
>>WILLS: It isn't important.

00:47:25.255 --> 00:47:28.050 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Doesn't make us
any less potent as healers?

00:47:28.050 --> 00:47:28.550 align:middle line:90%
>>WILLS: No.

00:47:28.550 --> 00:47:32.240 align:middle line:84%
It just shows you
what's possible.

00:47:32.240 --> 00:47:35.950 align:middle line:84%
Sometimes, there are those folks
who come up and say, oh sure,

00:47:35.950 --> 00:47:42.140 align:middle line:84%
you can do all these
things and are a show-off.

00:47:42.140 --> 00:47:46.540 align:middle line:84%
But the reality is, it's
not about showing off

00:47:46.540 --> 00:47:47.670 align:middle line:90%
what I can do.

00:47:47.670 --> 00:47:50.090 align:middle line:84%
It's about showing,
this is what's possible.

00:47:50.090 --> 00:47:52.800 align:middle line:90%
You can do this too.

00:47:52.800 --> 00:47:55.670 align:middle line:90%
Let me help you get there.

00:47:55.670 --> 00:47:57.380 align:middle line:84%
And it's not about
taking my courses

00:47:57.380 --> 00:48:03.260 align:middle line:84%
or about any of this stuff where
there's a financial exchange.

00:48:03.260 --> 00:48:04.680 align:middle line:90%
That's all just hooey.

00:48:04.680 --> 00:48:06.800 align:middle line:90%
It's just stuff.

00:48:06.800 --> 00:48:09.890 align:middle line:84%
It's like, listen to
what I'm telling you.

00:48:09.890 --> 00:48:12.085 align:middle line:84%
Take the courses and
do all these things,

00:48:12.085 --> 00:48:15.580 align:middle line:84%
read all the books you can,
and spend this amount of money

00:48:15.580 --> 00:48:23.050 align:middle line:84%
to get to this point, or
wake up to who you really are

00:48:23.050 --> 00:48:25.287 align:middle line:90%
and trust yourself.

00:48:25.287 --> 00:48:27.120 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So when you're
doing your courses,

00:48:27.120 --> 00:48:29.630 align:middle line:84%
that's essentially just where
you're trying to get everybody?

00:48:29.630 --> 00:48:30.230 align:middle line:90%
>>WILLS: Sure.

00:48:30.230 --> 00:48:31.063 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Just that.

00:48:31.063 --> 00:48:32.680 align:middle line:84%
>>WILLS: Empowered
to understand,

00:48:32.680 --> 00:48:34.220 align:middle line:90%
this is who you are.

00:48:34.220 --> 00:48:36.570 align:middle line:90%
You're an aspect to what God is.

00:48:36.570 --> 00:48:38.150 align:middle line:90%
Do you get it now?

00:48:38.150 --> 00:48:40.040 align:middle line:90%
And they do.

00:48:40.040 --> 00:48:42.700 align:middle line:84%
When they take the
courses-- sure,

00:48:42.700 --> 00:48:46.377 align:middle line:84%
it's handy, because I can show
people how to see the aura.

00:48:46.377 --> 00:48:48.460 align:middle line:84%
And not with an aura
machine, or any of this stuff

00:48:48.460 --> 00:48:53.940 align:middle line:84%
but actually take a look and go,
wow, first time I ever saw it.

00:48:53.940 --> 00:48:55.570 align:middle line:90%
I can show them that.

00:48:55.570 --> 00:48:59.740 align:middle line:84%
And I can teach them how to
take that and move something.

00:48:59.740 --> 00:49:04.090 align:middle line:90%
But that's all well and good.

00:49:04.090 --> 00:49:10.790 align:middle line:84%
But really, the bottom line is,
just wake up to who you are.

00:49:10.790 --> 00:49:12.490 align:middle line:84%
It doesn't matter
how proficient you

00:49:12.490 --> 00:49:15.610 align:middle line:84%
think you are, because
in the long run,

00:49:15.610 --> 00:49:17.620 align:middle line:84%
no matter how
proficient I think I am,

00:49:17.620 --> 00:49:20.100 align:middle line:84%
there are still
those I can't help.

00:49:20.100 --> 00:49:23.450 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So let's say we
have someone significant

00:49:23.450 --> 00:49:25.210 align:middle line:84%
that we love in our
lives, and that person

00:49:25.210 --> 00:49:26.980 align:middle line:90%
has a terrible headache.

00:49:26.980 --> 00:49:29.232 align:middle line:84%
Is it sufficient to just
care about that person

00:49:29.232 --> 00:49:32.480 align:middle line:84%
and maybe just gently place
our hands on their head

00:49:32.480 --> 00:49:33.977 align:middle line:90%
and just love them?

00:49:33.977 --> 00:49:34.560 align:middle line:90%
>>WILLS: Sure.

00:49:34.560 --> 00:49:37.143 align:middle line:84%
And don't worry if you're going
to get the headache from them.

00:49:37.143 --> 00:49:39.810 align:middle line:84%
You probably will if
you're successful.

00:49:39.810 --> 00:49:41.710 align:middle line:90%
So here's how it works.

00:49:41.710 --> 00:49:44.242 align:middle line:90%
Let's say the headache issue.

00:49:44.242 --> 00:49:46.700 align:middle line:84%
You just put your hands there,
and you're just loving them.

00:49:46.700 --> 00:49:48.180 align:middle line:90%
You just feel love.

00:49:48.180 --> 00:49:49.800 align:middle line:90%
Nothing else.

00:49:49.800 --> 00:49:53.520 align:middle line:84%
You just breathe it
in and just allow

00:49:53.520 --> 00:49:56.910 align:middle line:90%
it to merge with the person.

00:49:56.910 --> 00:50:00.220 align:middle line:84%
And maybe you'll feel
the headache as well.

00:50:00.220 --> 00:50:02.210 align:middle line:90%
And if you do, fine.

00:50:02.210 --> 00:50:04.260 align:middle line:84%
What good's it being a
healer if you're isolated

00:50:04.260 --> 00:50:05.551 align:middle line:90%
from the people you're healing?

00:50:05.551 --> 00:50:08.970 align:middle line:84%
It's just part of
the experience.

00:50:08.970 --> 00:50:12.780 align:middle line:90%
Take a breath and let it go.

00:50:12.780 --> 00:50:14.140 align:middle line:90%
Give it back to God.

00:50:14.140 --> 00:50:16.900 align:middle line:90%
Give it back to the cosmos.

00:50:16.900 --> 00:50:19.460 align:middle line:90%
It's a circular thing.

00:50:19.460 --> 00:50:24.910 align:middle line:84%
The person has it, comes into
you, it's a gift back to God,

00:50:24.910 --> 00:50:26.410 align:middle line:90%
energy goes back through them.

00:50:26.410 --> 00:50:28.218 align:middle line:84%
It's a circular
thing as I see it.

00:50:28.218 --> 00:50:31.810 align:middle line:90%


00:50:31.810 --> 00:50:36.211 align:middle line:84%
And you just be yourself and
just allow this to happen.

00:50:36.211 --> 00:50:37.710 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: There's
so much more grace

00:50:37.710 --> 00:50:41.290 align:middle line:84%
in that than
thinking that we have

00:50:41.290 --> 00:50:44.810 align:middle line:84%
to have our own version of some
kind of doctoral degree just

00:50:44.810 --> 00:50:47.410 align:middle line:84%
to be able to help
energetically heal each other.

00:50:47.410 --> 00:50:48.300 align:middle line:84%
>>WILLS: Well,
there's a lot of folks

00:50:48.300 --> 00:50:50.050 align:middle line:84%
who have to go through
a rite and a ritual

00:50:50.050 --> 00:50:52.210 align:middle line:84%
in order to get
ready to do this.

00:50:52.210 --> 00:50:54.870 align:middle line:84%
And then while they're
doing it, more ritual.

00:50:54.870 --> 00:50:57.550 align:middle line:84%
And then when they
finish, more ritual.

00:50:57.550 --> 00:51:00.760 align:middle line:84%
It's as though it's stuck
in a paradigm where there

00:51:00.760 --> 00:51:03.150 align:middle line:90%
are rules and regulations.

00:51:03.150 --> 00:51:10.310 align:middle line:84%
If you were to venture into that
somewhat undiscovered country,

00:51:10.310 --> 00:51:14.620 align:middle line:84%
where what if you
really were God?

00:51:14.620 --> 00:51:18.675 align:middle line:84%
What rules would you grow
tired of after a while?

00:51:18.675 --> 00:51:20.780 align:middle line:84%
And wouldn't it
just be your state

00:51:20.780 --> 00:51:24.960 align:middle line:84%
of being making the difference
instead of standing on one foot

00:51:24.960 --> 00:51:27.410 align:middle line:90%
and saying these words?

00:51:27.410 --> 00:51:30.250 align:middle line:84%
Or you have to use your left
hand or your right hand.

00:51:30.250 --> 00:51:32.860 align:middle line:84%
Or you have close your
eyes or open your eyes.

00:51:32.860 --> 00:51:35.950 align:middle line:84%
All these little things,
these little technicalities,

00:51:35.950 --> 00:51:39.610 align:middle line:84%
are something that
people put in place.

00:51:39.610 --> 00:51:42.970 align:middle line:84%
And these are limiting items
because if you forget one,

00:51:42.970 --> 00:51:44.500 align:middle line:90%
it doesn't work.

00:51:44.500 --> 00:51:45.930 align:middle line:90%
Oh my god.

00:51:45.930 --> 00:51:47.250 align:middle line:90%
I tried to help the person.

00:51:47.250 --> 00:51:53.340 align:middle line:84%
I forgot to put my tongue
on the left side of my jaw,

00:51:53.340 --> 00:51:54.170 align:middle line:90%
and it didn't work.

00:51:54.170 --> 00:51:56.860 align:middle line:84%
I'm not going to
tell them I did that,

00:51:56.860 --> 00:51:58.930 align:middle line:90%
but next time, I'll remember.

00:51:58.930 --> 00:51:59.490 align:middle line:90%
It's silly.

00:51:59.490 --> 00:52:01.170 align:middle line:84%
You don't need to do
this sort of thing.

00:52:01.170 --> 00:52:03.460 align:middle line:84%
You just be who
you are, breathe,

00:52:03.460 --> 00:52:05.000 align:middle line:90%
and just let the energy flow.

00:52:05.000 --> 00:52:07.450 align:middle line:84%
You're not going
to push the energy.

00:52:07.450 --> 00:52:09.280 align:middle line:90%
Energy can't be pushed.

00:52:09.280 --> 00:52:13.260 align:middle line:84%
It is given a set of
desires and instructions

00:52:13.260 --> 00:52:16.180 align:middle line:90%
and allowed to go where it goes.

00:52:16.180 --> 00:52:19.630 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So maybe
to build confidence,

00:52:19.630 --> 00:52:24.620 align:middle line:84%
it would be good for a person
who wishes to be of service

00:52:24.620 --> 00:52:28.440 align:middle line:84%
and feels that they
innately have the desire,

00:52:28.440 --> 00:52:31.460 align:middle line:84%
the ability to heal,
whatnot, to maybe not say

00:52:31.460 --> 00:52:32.340 align:middle line:90%
anything about it.

00:52:32.340 --> 00:52:35.117 align:middle line:84%
Maybe if someone has a headache,
just to hold their head

00:52:35.117 --> 00:52:36.575 align:middle line:84%
and love them, and
not say, I'm not

00:52:36.575 --> 00:52:38.420 align:middle line:84%
going to get rid of
your headache for you.

00:52:38.420 --> 00:52:40.530 align:middle line:84%
And then just see
what transpires.

00:52:40.530 --> 00:52:42.980 align:middle line:84%
And over time, one can
build because we're

00:52:42.980 --> 00:52:45.530 align:middle line:84%
humans with this
analytical part-- maybe do

00:52:45.530 --> 00:52:47.240 align:middle line:90%
this kind of thing often enough.

00:52:47.240 --> 00:52:48.950 align:middle line:84%
Just as a sympathetic
person would say,

00:52:48.950 --> 00:52:54.490 align:middle line:84%
oh, I'm so sorry that hurts and
place your hand there and watch

00:52:54.490 --> 00:52:56.160 align:middle line:90%
the results over time.

00:52:56.160 --> 00:52:57.747 align:middle line:84%
And that's the
confidence builder?

00:52:57.747 --> 00:52:58.580 align:middle line:90%
>>WILLS: I think so.

00:52:58.580 --> 00:53:01.160 align:middle line:90%
That would be a very good idea.

00:53:01.160 --> 00:53:04.800 align:middle line:84%
And don't do it with
some preconceived notion

00:53:04.800 --> 00:53:06.470 align:middle line:90%
of what you're supposed to do.

00:53:06.470 --> 00:53:10.620 align:middle line:84%
All you're supposed to do is
breathe and be the best version

00:53:10.620 --> 00:53:13.340 align:middle line:90%
of you that you can be.

00:53:13.340 --> 00:53:15.340 align:middle line:84%
Not the version that
everyone's expecting

00:53:15.340 --> 00:53:18.560 align:middle line:84%
or not the version that everyone
thinks a healer would be.

00:53:18.560 --> 00:53:22.880 align:middle line:84%
But just be you, honest
and to the point.

00:53:22.880 --> 00:53:25.310 align:middle line:90%
Just be who you are.

00:53:25.310 --> 00:53:27.160 align:middle line:84%
Because that's what
makes the difference.

00:53:27.160 --> 00:53:29.190 align:middle line:84%
And if your light is
going to shine brightly,

00:53:29.190 --> 00:53:32.040 align:middle line:84%
it's going to be because
you were doing that.

00:53:32.040 --> 00:53:36.430 align:middle line:84%
It doesn't shine that brightly
when you're not just being you.

00:53:36.430 --> 00:53:40.140 align:middle line:84%
It goes a little
bit on the dim side.

00:53:40.140 --> 00:53:42.880 align:middle line:84%
Being who you truly
are, that's what makes

00:53:42.880 --> 00:53:45.070 align:middle line:90%
the difference in the world.

00:53:45.070 --> 00:53:46.030 align:middle line:90%
Just caring.

00:53:46.030 --> 00:53:47.610 align:middle line:90%
Just being alive.

00:53:47.610 --> 00:53:51.310 align:middle line:84%
Breathing and
experiencing what it's

00:53:51.310 --> 00:53:53.080 align:middle line:84%
like to care about
another person,

00:53:53.080 --> 00:53:55.690 align:middle line:84%
even if you don't
know who they are.

00:53:55.690 --> 00:53:59.760 align:middle line:84%
All the people
that I work with, I

00:53:59.760 --> 00:54:01.645 align:middle line:90%
have to care about them first.

00:54:01.645 --> 00:54:02.310 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:54:02.310 --> 00:54:04.760 align:middle line:84%
>>WILLS: I have to
feel it in my heart.

00:54:04.760 --> 00:54:07.560 align:middle line:90%
And it's not hard to do.

00:54:07.560 --> 00:54:09.890 align:middle line:90%
Well, there are those--

00:54:09.890 --> 00:54:10.390 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHING]

00:54:10.390 --> 00:54:11.098 align:middle line:90%
I'm just kidding.

00:54:11.098 --> 00:54:13.970 align:middle line:90%


00:54:13.970 --> 00:54:16.160 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: But what
you're saying is so,

00:54:16.160 --> 00:54:20.160 align:middle line:90%
it's so basic, so logical.

00:54:20.160 --> 00:54:22.940 align:middle line:84%
It's so filled with a
really essential kind

00:54:22.940 --> 00:54:24.720 align:middle line:90%
of grace and wisdom.

00:54:24.720 --> 00:54:28.730 align:middle line:84%
As I said a little bit ago, it's
like you really can't go wrong.

00:54:28.730 --> 00:54:29.850 align:middle line:90%
>>WILLS: No, you can't.

00:54:29.850 --> 00:54:32.350 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And here, we're so
afraid of not being good enough

00:54:32.350 --> 00:54:34.750 align:middle line:90%
and being wrong as healers.

00:54:34.750 --> 00:54:35.582 align:middle line:90%
>>WILLS: Sure.

00:54:35.582 --> 00:54:37.290 align:middle line:84%
And you know, I don't
think that everyone

00:54:37.290 --> 00:54:41.020 align:middle line:84%
was meant to be the
healer, but we were all

00:54:41.020 --> 00:54:43.549 align:middle line:90%
meant to be healers.

00:54:43.549 --> 00:54:44.840 align:middle line:90%
And there's a difference there.

00:54:44.840 --> 00:54:47.870 align:middle line:84%
I mean, if it's really
what your life work is

00:54:47.870 --> 00:54:53.300 align:middle line:84%
and what your passion
is, go for it.

00:54:53.300 --> 00:55:00.070 align:middle line:84%
But some people just need to
be present at the right moment.

00:55:00.070 --> 00:55:03.570 align:middle line:84%
And that makes all
the difference.

00:55:03.570 --> 00:55:06.560 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Years ago, I
had a dream one night.

00:55:06.560 --> 00:55:09.730 align:middle line:84%
Actually, there was a
flying saucer involved.

00:55:09.730 --> 00:55:12.250 align:middle line:84%
It came over my-- it was
like I'm a Greek painting.

00:55:12.250 --> 00:55:14.380 align:middle line:84%
We were all standing
watching the solar eclipse,

00:55:14.380 --> 00:55:16.300 align:middle line:90%
and a spaceship came along.

00:55:16.300 --> 00:55:19.220 align:middle line:84%
Came over my head and started
downloading massive amounts

00:55:19.220 --> 00:55:20.660 align:middle line:90%
of energy into my head.

00:55:20.660 --> 00:55:23.760 align:middle line:84%
And I was embarrassed because
I thought other people could

00:55:23.760 --> 00:55:25.210 align:middle line:90%
see that happening.

00:55:25.210 --> 00:55:29.310 align:middle line:84%
So I turned around, head down,
and went into my little house,

00:55:29.310 --> 00:55:32.560 align:middle line:84%
and picked up a pot
holder, and it caught fire

00:55:32.560 --> 00:55:36.390 align:middle line:84%
because a blue flame was
coming out of my fingers, which

00:55:36.390 --> 00:55:37.830 align:middle line:90%
had happened.

00:55:37.830 --> 00:55:41.410 align:middle line:84%
And the voice simply said,
it happens every now and then

00:55:41.410 --> 00:55:41.910 align:middle line:90%
like this.

00:55:41.910 --> 00:55:44.380 align:middle line:84%
It's time to begin
healing again.

00:55:44.380 --> 00:55:45.820 align:middle line:90%
And so, all right.

00:55:45.820 --> 00:55:48.920 align:middle line:84%
Well within the next two weeks,
I cannot tell you how many

00:55:48.920 --> 00:55:53.367 align:middle line:84%
things happened, starting the
very next day I came upon a car

00:55:53.367 --> 00:55:55.700 align:middle line:84%
accident, where the woman had
been thrown out of the car

00:55:55.700 --> 00:55:58.520 align:middle line:90%
in Arizona into the cactus.

00:55:58.520 --> 00:55:59.912 align:middle line:90%
>>WILLS: Oh, dear.

00:55:59.912 --> 00:56:01.670 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:56:01.670 --> 00:56:03.420 align:middle line:90%
And I was the first one there.

00:56:03.420 --> 00:56:07.290 align:middle line:84%
And just calming her and her
nervous system down until they

00:56:07.290 --> 00:56:09.440 align:middle line:84%
could come and extricate
her from the cactus

00:56:09.440 --> 00:56:11.540 align:middle line:90%
and take her to the hospital.

00:56:11.540 --> 00:56:15.060 align:middle line:84%
But one thing after-- heat
stroke, a very weird skin

00:56:15.060 --> 00:56:17.470 align:middle line:84%
condition, and I just
remembered the dream.

00:56:17.470 --> 00:56:18.410 align:middle line:90%
Oh, yeah.

00:56:18.410 --> 00:56:19.520 align:middle line:90%
So I just touched people.

00:56:19.520 --> 00:56:21.720 align:middle line:84%
And I could feel kind
of blue flames tingling

00:56:21.720 --> 00:56:24.120 align:middle line:84%
in those fingers,
the fingertips there.

00:56:24.120 --> 00:56:26.790 align:middle line:84%
And it worked every
time because it was just

00:56:26.790 --> 00:56:29.300 align:middle line:84%
laid out that I was to
be at certain places

00:56:29.300 --> 00:56:30.182 align:middle line:90%
at a certain time.

00:56:30.182 --> 00:56:31.640 align:middle line:84%
>>WILLS: Well,
that's how it works.

00:56:31.640 --> 00:56:35.256 align:middle line:84%
You know, I think we are
doing this, just being you--

00:56:35.256 --> 00:56:39.810 align:middle line:84%
that it's not that these
are put into your path,

00:56:39.810 --> 00:56:42.550 align:middle line:84%
but you're drawn to
those who need you.

00:56:42.550 --> 00:56:43.640 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah, exactly.

00:56:43.640 --> 00:56:47.460 align:middle line:84%
And it's totally
effortless in that way.

00:56:47.460 --> 00:56:50.830 align:middle line:84%
It's been wonderful
talking with you as always.

00:56:50.830 --> 00:56:52.354 align:middle line:90%
Any final thoughts on this?

00:56:52.354 --> 00:56:54.020 align:middle line:84%
I mean, I think these
things you've said

00:56:54.020 --> 00:56:56.090 align:middle line:90%
about just being authentic.

00:56:56.090 --> 00:56:58.390 align:middle line:84%
Don't try to pretend
we're something we're not

00:56:58.390 --> 00:57:00.620 align:middle line:84%
and to show up
with care and love.

00:57:00.620 --> 00:57:02.900 align:middle line:84%
We're not trying to be
the big "I Am" here.

00:57:02.900 --> 00:57:06.589 align:middle line:84%
It's a natural way of
being to help each other.

00:57:06.589 --> 00:57:07.880 align:middle line:90%
>>WILLS: We are the big "I Am."

00:57:07.880 --> 00:57:08.735 align:middle line:90%
Person to person.

00:57:08.735 --> 00:57:09.860 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Person to person.

00:57:09.860 --> 00:57:11.700 align:middle line:84%
Any other thoughts
you have before we

00:57:11.700 --> 00:57:12.742 align:middle line:90%
wrap up our conversation?

00:57:12.742 --> 00:57:14.200 align:middle line:84%
>>WILLS: Well,
there will always be

00:57:14.200 --> 00:57:16.740 align:middle line:84%
people who agree and disagree
with the things that I say

00:57:16.740 --> 00:57:20.480 align:middle line:84%
and things that I do, my
opinions, and that's fine.

00:57:20.480 --> 00:57:22.960 align:middle line:90%
It's good that people do.

00:57:22.960 --> 00:57:25.540 align:middle line:84%
I think that more
than anything else,

00:57:25.540 --> 00:57:28.680 align:middle line:84%
if anyone listening is
interested to go beyond where

00:57:28.680 --> 00:57:31.650 align:middle line:84%
they are, they simply
need to look in a mirror

00:57:31.650 --> 00:57:33.260 align:middle line:90%
and find God within.

00:57:33.260 --> 00:57:37.340 align:middle line:84%
Because these are the tenants
that bring you to that point.

00:57:37.340 --> 00:57:39.950 align:middle line:84%
You find peace within
yourself, and your world

00:57:39.950 --> 00:57:42.570 align:middle line:90%
becomes a peaceful place.

00:57:42.570 --> 00:57:45.350 align:middle line:84%
Be who you are and let
your light shine brightly.

00:57:45.350 --> 00:57:47.620 align:middle line:90%
That's my advice to everyone.

00:57:47.620 --> 00:57:49.760 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Couldn't be
more pure than that.

00:57:49.760 --> 00:57:52.330 align:middle line:84%
Oh, by the way, one final
question before we sign off.

00:57:52.330 --> 00:57:55.920 align:middle line:84%
Do these same principles apply
with our little beloved furry

00:57:55.920 --> 00:57:56.420 align:middle line:90%
ones?

00:57:56.420 --> 00:57:58.370 align:middle line:90%
Pets and animals and such?

00:57:58.370 --> 00:57:59.380 align:middle line:90%
>>WILLS: It does.

00:57:59.380 --> 00:58:03.930 align:middle line:10%
I work with a lot of animals--
horses, dogs, cats, snakes,

00:58:03.930 --> 00:58:05.620 align:middle line:10%
mountain lions.

00:58:05.620 --> 00:58:07.160 align:middle line:10%
I worked on all of them.

00:58:07.160 --> 00:58:08.530 align:middle line:10%
And it's the same.

00:58:08.530 --> 00:58:10.300 align:middle line:10%
Animals are a lot
easier to work with

00:58:10.300 --> 00:58:13.840 align:middle line:10%
because they don't have a
rationale in place that says,

00:58:13.840 --> 00:58:15.680 align:middle line:10%
I don't know if I
believe this stuff.

00:58:15.680 --> 00:58:19.710 align:middle line:84%
They just lie there
and allow it to happen.

00:58:19.710 --> 00:58:21.690 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Once again,
thank you so much, Jerry.

00:58:21.690 --> 00:58:24.170 align:middle line:84%
I love the purity
of this message.

00:58:24.170 --> 00:58:25.919 align:middle line:84%
>>WILLS: Thank you
for having me on.

00:58:25.919 --> 00:58:28.210 align:middle line:10%
>>REGINA: To learn more about
Jerry's healing workshops

00:58:28.210 --> 00:58:30.335 align:middle line:10%
and other adventures, you
can go to jerrywills.com.

00:58:30.335 --> 00:58:32.870 align:middle line:84%
If you haven't already
done so, please

00:58:32.870 --> 00:58:35.120 align:middle line:84%
enjoy my other two
interviews with Jerry.

00:58:35.120 --> 00:58:37.590 align:middle line:84%
Until next time, thank you for
