00:00:28.060 --> 00:00:30.560 align:middle line:10%
>>REGINA MEREDITH: Most of you
watching this are fairly well

00:00:30.560 --> 00:00:32.060 align:middle line:10%
aware of the events
of Roswell, New

00:00:32.060 --> 00:00:34.570 align:middle line:10%
Mexico in the summer of 1947.

00:00:34.570 --> 00:00:36.620 align:middle line:84%
What you may not be
aware of, however,

00:00:36.620 --> 00:00:38.690 align:middle line:84%
is that there was an
equally stunning event that

00:00:38.690 --> 00:00:42.090 align:middle line:84%
happened in Rendlesham
Forest in England in 1980.

00:00:42.090 --> 00:00:43.940 align:middle line:84%
In addition, this
case was very well

00:00:43.940 --> 00:00:46.040 align:middle line:84%
documented by those
in the military.

00:00:46.040 --> 00:00:47.780 align:middle line:84%
In a two part interview
with Nick Pope,

00:00:47.780 --> 00:00:50.420 align:middle line:84%
formerly with the British
Ministry of Defense,

00:00:50.420 --> 00:00:53.150 align:middle line:84%
we will hear what happened
on three consecutive nights

00:00:53.150 --> 00:00:55.180 align:middle line:84%
in the forest and
how governments

00:00:55.180 --> 00:00:58.050 align:middle line:84%
go about covering up or
clouding the facts to keep

00:00:58.050 --> 00:00:59.350 align:middle line:90%
it secret from the public.

00:00:59.350 --> 00:01:02.230 align:middle line:10%
>>SGT. JAMES PENNISTON: The
craft itself was void of things

00:01:02.230 --> 00:01:03.820 align:middle line:10%
that aircraft need to fly.

00:01:03.820 --> 00:01:08.260 align:middle line:10%
I mean, it did not have a crew
compartment that I could see.

00:01:08.260 --> 00:01:09.260 align:middle line:10%
It did not have exhaust.

00:01:09.260 --> 00:01:10.410 align:middle line:10%
It did not have intake.

00:01:10.410 --> 00:01:14.675 align:middle line:10%
I couldn't-- I did not
know what the front was.

00:01:14.675 --> 00:01:17.060 align:middle line:84%
So it was pretty void
of all those things.

00:01:17.060 --> 00:01:19.860 align:middle line:84%
And aerodynamically,
well, it was a brick.

00:01:19.860 --> 00:01:22.480 align:middle line:84%
I mean, there's no way
that thing could fly.

00:01:22.480 --> 00:01:25.507 align:middle line:84%
And my mindset at the time was
that was not going anywhere.

00:01:25.507 --> 00:01:26.840 align:middle line:90%
It was just going to stay there.

00:01:26.840 --> 00:01:30.240 align:middle line:84%
So I had all the
time in the world.

00:01:30.240 --> 00:01:33.080 align:middle line:84%
>>SGT. JOHN BURROUGHS: Can I
take a second to add to that?

00:01:33.080 --> 00:01:36.110 align:middle line:84%
The reason why we were sent
out there by our ship commander

00:01:36.110 --> 00:01:38.130 align:middle line:84%
and after a discussion
on the phone

00:01:38.130 --> 00:01:44.700 align:middle line:84%
was the fact that eastern radar
was contacted and notified us

00:01:44.700 --> 00:01:46.190 align:middle line:84%
that there was
some kind of object

00:01:46.190 --> 00:01:49.040 align:middle line:84%
over the base that
disappeared in the forest.

00:01:49.040 --> 00:01:52.310 align:middle line:84%
Because it was off base, our
jurisdiction was limited.

00:01:52.310 --> 00:01:56.270 align:middle line:84%
But because the possibility
existed that something actually

00:01:56.270 --> 00:01:58.210 align:middle line:84%
crashed in the
forest, the decision

00:01:58.210 --> 00:02:00.310 align:middle line:84%
was made by the shift
commander to allow

00:02:00.310 --> 00:02:02.636 align:middle line:84%
us to go out into the
forest and investigate.

00:02:02.636 --> 00:02:04.260 align:middle line:10%
At the same time,
the local authorities

00:02:04.260 --> 00:02:05.869 align:middle line:10%
were contacted also.

00:02:05.869 --> 00:02:07.410 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: We're
going to launch right

00:02:07.410 --> 00:02:09.800 align:middle line:84%
into the events in a
minute because there's

00:02:09.800 --> 00:02:11.490 align:middle line:84%
so much that we
have to go by way.

00:02:11.490 --> 00:02:14.080 align:middle line:84%
This was so much better
documented than Roswell.

00:02:14.080 --> 00:02:16.520 align:middle line:84%
It's almost as though Roswell
was just swept under the rug

00:02:16.520 --> 00:02:19.620 align:middle line:84%
and left where
this one had act--

00:02:19.620 --> 00:02:21.580 align:middle line:84%
there was active knowledge
that was documented

00:02:21.580 --> 00:02:23.430 align:middle line:84%
from the very
beginning of the event.

00:02:23.430 --> 00:02:26.124 align:middle line:84%
But so here we go
back to, what was it?

00:02:26.124 --> 00:02:26.790 align:middle line:90%
Christmas night.

00:02:26.790 --> 00:02:28.010 align:middle line:90%
Everybody has a full belly.

00:02:28.010 --> 00:02:29.600 align:middle line:84%
They've gone to bed
after celebrating

00:02:29.600 --> 00:02:31.070 align:middle line:90%
Christmas festivities.

00:02:31.070 --> 00:02:34.720 align:middle line:84%
And in the wee hours, begin
telling us what happened.

00:02:34.720 --> 00:02:35.620 align:middle line:90%
>>NICK POPE: Sure.

00:02:35.620 --> 00:02:40.050 align:middle line:10%
It's the early hours
of December 26, 1980.

00:02:40.050 --> 00:02:45.180 align:middle line:10%
And law enforcement and
security police personnel

00:02:45.180 --> 00:02:49.250 align:middle line:10%
guarding these twin bases
of Bentwaters and Woodbridge

00:02:49.250 --> 00:02:52.520 align:middle line:10%
in the United Kingdom
see strange lights

00:02:52.520 --> 00:02:55.690 align:middle line:10%
in the forest-- like strange,
multi-colored lights.

00:02:55.690 --> 00:02:58.240 align:middle line:84%
And they really don't
know what to make of this.

00:02:58.240 --> 00:03:00.120 align:middle line:84%
It's like nothing
they've ever seen before.

00:03:00.120 --> 00:03:03.650 align:middle line:84%
Their first thought is
that maybe an aircraft

00:03:03.650 --> 00:03:05.850 align:middle line:90%
has crashed and is burning.

00:03:05.850 --> 00:03:07.970 align:middle line:90%
There are chemicals.

00:03:07.970 --> 00:03:09.940 align:middle line:90%
There is a fire.

00:03:09.940 --> 00:03:11.090 align:middle line:10%
They don't know.

00:03:11.090 --> 00:03:14.010 align:middle line:10%
So they seek
permission to go out,

00:03:14.010 --> 00:03:17.030 align:middle line:10%
to investigate, and
to launch, I guess,

00:03:17.030 --> 00:03:20.290 align:middle line:10%
a search and rescue
mission if needs be.

00:03:20.290 --> 00:03:22.870 align:middle line:84%
But then as they
go out, one of them

00:03:22.870 --> 00:03:25.670 align:middle line:84%
says something that
really shocks the others.

00:03:25.670 --> 00:03:28.205 align:middle line:90%
And he says it didn't crash.

00:03:28.205 --> 00:03:29.800 align:middle line:90%
It landed.

00:03:29.800 --> 00:03:34.360 align:middle line:84%
And that, as you can imagine,
kind of sets everyone on edge.

00:03:34.360 --> 00:03:35.550 align:middle line:90%
And everyone's very nervy.

00:03:35.550 --> 00:03:39.710 align:middle line:84%
And there's a number of
different people driving out

00:03:39.710 --> 00:03:43.290 align:middle line:84%
through one of the main gates
in a Jeep into the forest.

00:03:43.290 --> 00:03:45.620 align:middle line:84%
And just to put this
into its context,

00:03:45.620 --> 00:03:50.650 align:middle line:84%
Bentwaters and Woodbridge are
ostensibly Royal Air Force

00:03:50.650 --> 00:03:51.570 align:middle line:90%
bases.

00:03:51.570 --> 00:03:53.430 align:middle line:90%
But that's just a fiction.

00:03:53.430 --> 00:03:57.320 align:middle line:84%
They're called RAF Bentwaters
and RAF Woodbridge.

00:03:57.320 --> 00:03:58.527 align:middle line:90%
They're American bases.

00:03:58.527 --> 00:03:59.110 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:03:59.110 --> 00:04:01.380 align:middle line:84%
And how far are the two
apart just to give us some--

00:04:01.380 --> 00:04:03.890 align:middle line:84%
>>POPE: Really no more
than a few hundred yards.

00:04:03.890 --> 00:04:04.390 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: OK

00:04:04.390 --> 00:04:07.670 align:middle line:84%
>>POPE: Rendlesham Forest
effectively lies between them.

00:04:07.670 --> 00:04:10.140 align:middle line:84%
And you know, they're
so close together

00:04:10.140 --> 00:04:13.840 align:middle line:84%
that from a command and
control point of view,

00:04:13.840 --> 00:04:16.160 align:middle line:84%
they're treated as
a single entity.

00:04:16.160 --> 00:04:19.290 align:middle line:84%
So they're sometimes
described as the twin bases.

00:04:19.290 --> 00:04:22.089 align:middle line:84%
In other words, there's
one commanding officer

00:04:22.089 --> 00:04:24.520 align:middle line:84%
and there's one
deputy base commander.

00:04:24.520 --> 00:04:25.670 align:middle line:90%
We'll come onto him later.

00:04:25.670 --> 00:04:26.920 align:middle line:90%
He's a big part of the story.

00:04:26.920 --> 00:04:27.503 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:04:27.503 --> 00:04:28.670 align:middle line:90%
And also, it's interesting.

00:04:28.670 --> 00:04:31.100 align:middle line:84%
Because right away,
just from what you said,

00:04:31.100 --> 00:04:35.360 align:middle line:84%
we can hear that this is going
to be a very messy affair.

00:04:35.360 --> 00:04:39.560 align:middle line:84%
Because you have Americans
occupying a British base.

00:04:39.560 --> 00:04:42.750 align:middle line:84%
And you have both commands that
are drawn into this whole thing

00:04:42.750 --> 00:04:45.584 align:middle line:84%
maybe at counter
purposes at times, even.

00:04:45.584 --> 00:04:47.000 align:middle line:84%
>>POPE: You're
absolutely spot on.

00:04:47.000 --> 00:04:51.930 align:middle line:84%
And this whole kind of
conflict between the Americans

00:04:51.930 --> 00:04:54.620 align:middle line:84%
and the Brits in
terms of jurisdiction,

00:04:54.620 --> 00:04:57.900 align:middle line:84%
in terms of primacy,
leads to lot of confusion.

00:04:57.900 --> 00:05:00.310 align:middle line:84%
And I'm sure we'll get into
a discussion about where

00:05:00.310 --> 00:05:04.320 align:middle line:84%
the line is between conspiracy
and bureaucracy, for example.

00:05:04.320 --> 00:05:05.470 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes, yes.

00:05:05.470 --> 00:05:08.100 align:middle line:84%
That sometimes is a lot more
subtle line then a lot of us

00:05:08.100 --> 00:05:08.700 align:middle line:90%
would think.

00:05:08.700 --> 00:05:10.750 align:middle line:84%
Because a lot of
people watching this

00:05:10.750 --> 00:05:14.040 align:middle line:84%
have been heavily ensconced
in conspiracy information.

00:05:14.040 --> 00:05:16.030 align:middle line:84%
And so there's
just an assumption

00:05:16.030 --> 00:05:18.480 align:middle line:84%
that there is an agenda going
on when, oftentimes, it's

00:05:18.480 --> 00:05:20.940 align:middle line:90%
such a mess of bureaucracy.

00:05:20.940 --> 00:05:22.839 align:middle line:90%
It's not always what it seems.

00:05:22.839 --> 00:05:24.880 align:middle line:84%
>>POPE: It isn't, although
sometimes of course it

00:05:24.880 --> 00:05:25.380 align:middle line:90%
can be both.

00:05:25.380 --> 00:05:26.320 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Absolutely.

00:05:26.320 --> 00:05:28.930 align:middle line:84%
Yeah, I'm not just
dismissing that part.

00:05:28.930 --> 00:05:31.570 align:middle line:84%
It's just as we see here, it's
just as we get further in,

00:05:31.570 --> 00:05:34.045 align:middle line:84%
it's just fascinating
how this stuff then

00:05:34.045 --> 00:05:37.809 align:middle line:84%
ends up being shoved aside
so you can't find it anymore.

00:05:37.809 --> 00:05:39.850 align:middle line:84%
But meanwhile, let's go
back to the event itself.

00:05:39.850 --> 00:05:42.899 align:middle line:84%
We have First Class
Airman John Burroughs.

00:05:42.899 --> 00:05:44.440 align:middle line:84%
He's the one that
spotted the lights.

00:05:44.440 --> 00:05:46.050 align:middle line:84%
And he told his
Sergeant-- and this

00:05:46.050 --> 00:05:48.730 align:middle line:84%
is the beginning of the
documentation-- Budd Steffens.

00:05:48.730 --> 00:05:50.206 align:middle line:84%
Let's go into what
happened there.

00:05:50.206 --> 00:05:51.330 align:middle line:90%
>>POPE: Well, that's right.

00:05:51.330 --> 00:05:53.720 align:middle line:90%
Budd Steffens is out there.

00:05:53.720 --> 00:05:55.550 align:middle line:10%
John Burroughs is out there.

00:05:55.550 --> 00:05:59.140 align:middle line:10%
And then the security--
the senior security police

00:05:59.140 --> 00:06:03.020 align:middle line:10%
officer on duty Jim Penniston,
gets in on the act, too.

00:06:03.020 --> 00:06:06.340 align:middle line:10%
And he comes almost to sort
this out and say, come on,

00:06:06.340 --> 00:06:07.990 align:middle line:10%
what's going on
out here, people?

00:06:07.990 --> 00:06:09.910 align:middle line:10%
Let's put this to bed.

00:06:09.910 --> 00:06:14.290 align:middle line:84%
And he has his rider--
basically his driver-- Ed

00:06:14.290 --> 00:06:15.870 align:middle line:90%
Cabansag with him.

00:06:15.870 --> 00:06:17.500 align:middle line:84%
So right from the
outset, you've got

00:06:17.500 --> 00:06:20.120 align:middle line:84%
a number of different
people involved.

00:06:20.120 --> 00:06:22.900 align:middle line:84%
This number starts
to thin out a little.

00:06:22.900 --> 00:06:24.400 align:middle line:90%
Because something weird happens.

00:06:24.400 --> 00:06:28.700 align:middle line:84%
As they drive out into the
forest-- well, first of all,

00:06:28.700 --> 00:06:29.540 align:middle line:90%
this isn't weird.

00:06:29.540 --> 00:06:33.220 align:middle line:84%
But the path just gets
narrower and narrower.

00:06:33.220 --> 00:06:34.880 align:middle line:84%
And there's a
certain point where

00:06:34.880 --> 00:06:37.020 align:middle line:84%
they can't drive the
Jeep any further.

00:06:37.020 --> 00:06:40.070 align:middle line:84%
So they get out and
they continue on foot.

00:06:40.070 --> 00:06:43.220 align:middle line:84%
But then, their radios
start to cut out.

00:06:43.220 --> 00:06:48.110 align:middle line:84%
Now, these were very reliable
line of sight radios.

00:06:48.110 --> 00:06:52.080 align:middle line:84%
And suddenly, there's just
interference and crackling.

00:06:52.080 --> 00:06:54.590 align:middle line:84%
And about the only
place that this happens

00:06:54.590 --> 00:06:55.890 align:middle line:90%
is if there's a dip.

00:06:55.890 --> 00:06:57.490 align:middle line:90%
And that wasn't the case here.

00:06:57.490 --> 00:06:59.170 align:middle line:90%
So they think, what's going on?

00:06:59.170 --> 00:07:03.610 align:middle line:84%
And so they leave some
of the other people back.

00:07:03.610 --> 00:07:09.640 align:middle line:84%
And ultimately, it's just John
Burroughs and Jim Penniston

00:07:09.640 --> 00:07:13.200 align:middle line:84%
who really are the two at the
absolute vanguard of this.

00:07:13.200 --> 00:07:17.460 align:middle line:84%
They go forward to find
out what this thing is,

00:07:17.460 --> 00:07:19.580 align:middle line:84%
this thing which
originally they thought was

00:07:19.580 --> 00:07:20.930 align:middle line:90%
may be a crashed aircraft.

00:07:20.930 --> 00:07:22.388 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: How did
they approach it?

00:07:22.388 --> 00:07:23.750 align:middle line:90%
I mean, were they armed?

00:07:23.750 --> 00:07:25.824 align:middle line:84%
Not that it would matter
in a scenario like this.

00:07:25.824 --> 00:07:27.240 align:middle line:84%
But we think of
the normal way as,

00:07:27.240 --> 00:07:30.460 align:middle line:84%
like, they must have
had some nerviness to go

00:07:30.460 --> 00:07:32.920 align:middle line:84%
into the forest, get out of
their Jeep, go into the forest,

00:07:32.920 --> 00:07:34.490 align:middle line:84%
and start walking
toward this thing

00:07:34.490 --> 00:07:37.450 align:middle line:84%
that's landed that has
these flashing lights.

00:07:37.450 --> 00:07:39.250 align:middle line:84%
Did they have any
kind of defense

00:07:39.250 --> 00:07:41.830 align:middle line:84%
at all that one would
normally look to

00:07:41.830 --> 00:07:43.470 align:middle line:84%
in a situation like
that, even if it's

00:07:43.470 --> 00:07:45.137 align:middle line:90%
somewhat comical in hindsight?

00:07:45.137 --> 00:07:46.720 align:middle line:84%
>>POPE: Well, you
know, right away, we

00:07:46.720 --> 00:07:48.880 align:middle line:84%
run into one of
the controversies

00:07:48.880 --> 00:07:51.070 align:middle line:90%
about this with that question.

00:07:51.070 --> 00:07:55.680 align:middle line:84%
In theory, these being
American bases on British soil,

00:07:55.680 --> 00:07:57.800 align:middle line:84%
there were very
few circumstances

00:07:57.800 --> 00:08:02.620 align:middle line:84%
where live weapons would be
allowed outside the perimeter.

00:08:02.620 --> 00:08:05.750 align:middle line:84%
In some counter-terrorist
situations, maybe.

00:08:05.750 --> 00:08:09.050 align:middle line:84%
Anyway, the guys say that
all left their weapons back

00:08:09.050 --> 00:08:10.160 align:middle line:90%
at base.

00:08:10.160 --> 00:08:12.337 align:middle line:84%
Well, you know, I
don't know about that.

00:08:12.337 --> 00:08:13.920 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Well,
that's why I'm asking.

00:08:13.920 --> 00:08:15.740 align:middle line:84%
You would think that
your impulse would

00:08:15.740 --> 00:08:17.940 align:middle line:84%
be to pick up anything that
you're familiar with it

00:08:17.940 --> 00:08:21.050 align:middle line:84%
that you could feel might
defend oneself with.

00:08:21.050 --> 00:08:21.550 align:middle line:90%
>>POPE: Yes.

00:08:21.550 --> 00:08:25.720 align:middle line:84%
Their party line has been,
yeah, we didn't take our guns.

00:08:25.720 --> 00:08:26.630 align:middle line:90%
But--

00:08:26.630 --> 00:08:29.190 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: There have been
some rumor inside that said--

00:08:29.190 --> 00:08:29.880 align:middle line:90%
>>POPE: Exactly.

00:08:29.880 --> 00:08:30.505 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:08:30.505 --> 00:08:32.240 align:middle line:90%
>>POPE: Now, they went out.

00:08:32.240 --> 00:08:33.770 align:middle line:84%
And yes, to answer
your question,

00:08:33.770 --> 00:08:36.419 align:middle line:84%
they were clearly
apprehensive about this.

00:08:36.419 --> 00:08:38.539 align:middle line:84%
I guess you could
say that-- well, I

00:08:38.539 --> 00:08:41.510 align:middle line:84%
suppose we've all watched things
like "The Blair Witch Project."

00:08:41.510 --> 00:08:44.900 align:middle line:84%
Any forest at night is a
pretty spooky, scary place.

00:08:44.900 --> 00:08:50.700 align:middle line:84%
But they're highly trained,
fairly tough people, obviously.

00:08:50.700 --> 00:08:52.670 align:middle line:90%
And they don't scare easily.

00:08:52.670 --> 00:08:54.781 align:middle line:90%
They were apprehensive.

00:08:54.781 --> 00:08:57.030 align:middle line:84%
Because this was like nothing
they'd ever seen before.

00:08:57.030 --> 00:09:00.200 align:middle line:84%
I mean, this clearly
wasn't a fire

00:09:00.200 --> 00:09:02.060 align:middle line:84%
as they got closer
and closer to this.

00:09:02.060 --> 00:09:04.680 align:middle line:84%
And the lights, there were
multi-colored lights, but all

00:09:04.680 --> 00:09:07.700 align:middle line:84%
the wrong colors
for aircraft lights.

00:09:07.700 --> 00:09:11.410 align:middle line:84%
Jim Penniston in particular
was exceptionally familiar

00:09:11.410 --> 00:09:13.880 align:middle line:84%
with all different
aircraft types.

00:09:13.880 --> 00:09:17.550 align:middle line:84%
So they were apprehensive,
but they had a mission.

00:09:17.550 --> 00:09:20.800 align:middle line:84%
And they went through
with their job.

00:09:20.800 --> 00:09:25.400 align:middle line:84%
So they approached this
small clearing in the trees.

00:09:25.400 --> 00:09:27.040 align:middle line:90%
And suddenly, there it was.

00:09:27.040 --> 00:09:30.140 align:middle line:84%
Not a crashed
aircraft-- a landed UFO.

00:09:30.140 --> 00:09:37.270 align:middle line:84%
A small, triangular shaped
craft maybe nine feet across,

00:09:37.270 --> 00:09:39.280 align:middle line:90%
nine feet tall.

00:09:39.280 --> 00:09:42.530 align:middle line:10%
Clearly, again, with Jim's
aircraft recognition hat

00:09:42.530 --> 00:09:47.112 align:middle line:10%
on, as he said years later,
well, like no aircraft--

00:09:47.112 --> 00:09:48.070 align:middle line:10%
>>REGINA: No prototype.

00:09:48.070 --> 00:09:48.569 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:09:48.569 --> 00:09:50.150 align:middle line:90%
>>POPE: No, nothing.

00:09:50.150 --> 00:09:53.450 align:middle line:84%
And strange markings on
the side of this thing.

00:09:53.450 --> 00:09:54.080 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes

00:09:54.080 --> 00:09:55.990 align:middle line:84%
>>POPE: A bit like
Egyptian hieroglyphs.

00:09:55.990 --> 00:09:56.700 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes

00:09:56.700 --> 00:09:58.930 align:middle line:90%
>>POPE: Now, he went up.

00:09:58.930 --> 00:10:01.230 align:middle line:84%
First thing he did, he
had a camera with him.

00:10:01.230 --> 00:10:04.270 align:middle line:84%
He shot off a
whole roll of film.

00:10:04.270 --> 00:10:07.040 align:middle line:84%
And then when he
finished with that,

00:10:07.040 --> 00:10:09.710 align:middle line:84%
he flipped out his
police notebook

00:10:09.710 --> 00:10:11.759 align:middle line:90%
and started sketching it.

00:10:11.759 --> 00:10:13.300 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Thank
goodness he did that.

00:10:13.300 --> 00:10:13.890 align:middle line:90%
>>POPE: Yes.

00:10:13.890 --> 00:10:17.224 align:middle line:84%
Because he was later told
that, oh, sorry, your film

00:10:17.224 --> 00:10:17.890 align:middle line:90%
didn't come out.

00:10:17.890 --> 00:10:18.875 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah, right.

00:10:18.875 --> 00:10:19.416 align:middle line:90%
>>POPE: Yeah.

00:10:19.416 --> 00:10:21.830 align:middle line:84%
Well, there is a debate
about that, you know.

00:10:21.830 --> 00:10:23.450 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: I mean it could've
been the same interference that

00:10:23.450 --> 00:10:25.658 align:middle line:84%
didn't allow the walkie-talkies
to work right, right?

00:10:25.658 --> 00:10:26.960 align:middle line:90%
>>POPE: And it could've been.

00:10:26.960 --> 00:10:30.680 align:middle line:84%
It could also have been there
was a very bright light source

00:10:30.680 --> 00:10:31.470 align:middle line:90%
here.

00:10:31.470 --> 00:10:35.090 align:middle line:84%
And particularly, and this is
an important point of the story

00:10:35.090 --> 00:10:36.950 align:middle line:84%
that perhaps we'll
get into, there

00:10:36.950 --> 00:10:41.760 align:middle line:84%
was high levels of
radioactivity in this clearing

00:10:41.760 --> 00:10:44.690 align:middle line:84%
almost certainly as a
direct result of the craft.

00:10:44.690 --> 00:10:47.450 align:middle line:90%
And any of those things may--

00:10:47.450 --> 00:10:49.510 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Yeah, could
affect the film.

00:10:49.510 --> 00:10:53.590 align:middle line:84%
>>POPE: Yeah, so we instantly--
we may not automatically

00:10:53.590 --> 00:10:56.000 align:middle line:84%
be in the conspiracy
territory here.

00:10:56.000 --> 00:11:00.550 align:middle line:84%
We may indeed be in, well,
these sorts of things happen.

00:11:00.550 --> 00:11:05.680 align:middle line:84%
Anyway, Jim is
documenting all this.

00:11:05.680 --> 00:11:07.980 align:middle line:90%
He approaches this craft.

00:11:07.980 --> 00:11:10.390 align:middle line:84%
And he starts-- he sees
these strange symbols

00:11:10.390 --> 00:11:11.602 align:middle line:90%
like the hieroglyph.

00:11:11.602 --> 00:11:13.260 align:middle line:90%
He touches them.

00:11:13.260 --> 00:11:17.470 align:middle line:84%
And then he touches the largest
one, a very prominent symbol

00:11:17.470 --> 00:11:21.420 align:middle line:84%
of a triangle shape with
a circle imposed on it.

00:11:21.420 --> 00:11:27.710 align:middle line:84%
And as he touches this thing,
there's a flash of light.

00:11:27.710 --> 00:11:30.310 align:middle line:90%
And he hits the deck.

00:11:30.310 --> 00:11:33.400 align:middle line:84%
Jim-- pardon me--
John, he looks back.

00:11:33.400 --> 00:11:34.900 align:middle line:90%
And John is on the ground.

00:11:34.900 --> 00:11:36.970 align:middle line:90%
This is to his perspective.

00:11:36.970 --> 00:11:39.640 align:middle line:84%
John remembers it kind
of a different way.

00:11:39.640 --> 00:11:41.730 align:middle line:84%
And, you know, all of
this is interesting.

00:11:41.730 --> 00:11:44.930 align:middle line:84%
Several people entered
the forest that evening.

00:11:44.930 --> 00:11:48.430 align:middle line:84%
They all came out with slightly
different recollections

00:11:48.430 --> 00:11:49.650 align:middle line:90%
of what took place.

00:11:49.650 --> 00:11:53.680 align:middle line:84%
Again, that's
interesting in of itself.

00:11:53.680 --> 00:11:57.020 align:middle line:84%
Jim thought John was maybe
a casualty at that point.

00:11:57.020 --> 00:11:58.090 align:middle line:90%
He's down.

00:11:58.090 --> 00:11:59.290 align:middle line:90%
He saw he was down.

00:11:59.290 --> 00:12:03.610 align:middle line:84%
John remembers, as he puts
it, going into the light.

00:12:03.610 --> 00:12:06.795 align:middle line:84%
Very provocative, given
some of the testimony

00:12:06.795 --> 00:12:09.810 align:middle line:84%
that we hear from people
in the UFO community

00:12:09.810 --> 00:12:12.400 align:middle line:84%
about these sorts
of experiences.

00:12:12.400 --> 00:12:19.120 align:middle line:84%
Suffice to say that this thing
is just hovering or maybe

00:12:19.120 --> 00:12:23.140 align:middle line:84%
landed on three legs on
a tripod like device.

00:12:23.140 --> 00:12:28.130 align:middle line:84%
When John touches that
final symbols, the flash,

00:12:28.130 --> 00:12:33.450 align:middle line:84%
the thing starts to slowly
rise up above the ground.

00:12:33.450 --> 00:12:39.350 align:middle line:84%
And it goes very, very
slowly up vertically.

00:12:39.350 --> 00:12:41.540 align:middle line:90%
It's a very small clearing.

00:12:41.540 --> 00:12:44.660 align:middle line:84%
It maneuvers its way
through this tiny gap

00:12:44.660 --> 00:12:48.240 align:middle line:84%
at the top of the trees--
maybe 30, 40, 50 feet up.

00:12:48.240 --> 00:12:52.290 align:middle line:84%
And then suddenly, it
just accelerates away

00:12:52.290 --> 00:12:53.730 align:middle line:90%
to the horizon.

00:12:53.730 --> 00:12:59.367 align:middle line:84%
And Jim writes in his police
notebook, speed impossible.

00:12:59.367 --> 00:12:59.950 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:12:59.950 --> 00:13:01.980 align:middle line:84%
And that was-- and
he had knowledge.

00:13:01.980 --> 00:13:03.890 align:middle line:84%
So this meant
something at the time.

00:13:03.890 --> 00:13:06.450 align:middle line:84%
There was another element
to it I read in your book.

00:13:06.450 --> 00:13:08.900 align:middle line:84%
And that had to do
with the feeling

00:13:08.900 --> 00:13:12.990 align:middle line:84%
they had as they
approached the craft.

00:13:12.990 --> 00:13:14.670 align:middle line:90%
The energy completely shifted.

00:13:14.670 --> 00:13:16.200 align:middle line:90%
Can you talk about that a bit?

00:13:16.200 --> 00:13:16.970 align:middle line:90%
>>POPE: Yes.

00:13:16.970 --> 00:13:22.240 align:middle line:84%
They've used expressions like
the air was heavy with almost

00:13:22.240 --> 00:13:25.040 align:middle line:90%
like a static electricity.

00:13:25.040 --> 00:13:29.650 align:middle line:84%
That there seemed to be an
almost an otherworldliness

00:13:29.650 --> 00:13:31.320 align:middle line:90%
about this.

00:13:31.320 --> 00:13:35.190 align:middle line:84%
The phrase almost like
walking through treacle

00:13:35.190 --> 00:13:40.750 align:middle line:84%
or being underwater is phrases
that both of them have used.

00:13:40.750 --> 00:13:43.360 align:middle line:90%
This was not a normal situation.

00:13:43.360 --> 00:13:46.310 align:middle line:84%
And again, one can
speculate about this.

00:13:46.310 --> 00:13:52.040 align:middle line:84%
But I think knowing what we know
now, clearly the focus is on

00:13:52.040 --> 00:13:56.370 align:middle line:84%
was there some sort of
energy source or propulsion

00:13:56.370 --> 00:13:59.720 align:middle line:84%
system at work, an
unconventional one, which

00:13:59.720 --> 00:14:04.620 align:middle line:84%
caused not only these strange
sensations, but things

00:14:04.620 --> 00:14:07.230 align:middle line:84%
like the interference
with the radios

00:14:07.230 --> 00:14:09.790 align:middle line:84%
that we spoke about
a little earlier.

00:14:09.790 --> 00:14:11.860 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And when he
was running his hand

00:14:11.860 --> 00:14:17.300 align:middle line:84%
over the craft, as I recall,
it was smooth like glass

00:14:17.300 --> 00:14:19.910 align:middle line:90%
until they hit those symbols.

00:14:19.910 --> 00:14:20.540 align:middle line:90%
>>POPE: Yes.

00:14:20.540 --> 00:14:21.960 align:middle line:90%
Now, these symbols were raised.

00:14:21.960 --> 00:14:26.990 align:middle line:84%
I mean, there was a definite
pattern and texture to them.

00:14:26.990 --> 00:14:30.350 align:middle line:84%
So it wasn't just
the fact that they

00:14:30.350 --> 00:14:33.940 align:middle line:84%
were the only marks
on this thing.

00:14:33.940 --> 00:14:36.160 align:middle line:84%
They had a different
texture, too.

00:14:36.160 --> 00:14:39.820 align:middle line:84%
And I mean, again, some people
have speculated-- I even

00:14:39.820 --> 00:14:42.420 align:middle line:84%
speculated when I
looked for some sort

00:14:42.420 --> 00:14:44.890 align:middle line:84%
of conventional explanation,
I said, well, look.

00:14:44.890 --> 00:14:48.430 align:middle line:84%
Could this have been some
sort of secret prototype

00:14:48.430 --> 00:14:50.270 align:middle line:90%
Soviet craft?

00:14:50.270 --> 00:14:54.620 align:middle line:84%
And could these strange letters
have been Cyrillic alphabet?

00:14:54.620 --> 00:14:55.920 align:middle line:90%
And Jim just laughed.

00:14:55.920 --> 00:14:59.120 align:middle line:84%
And he said, Nick, when I
say I was trained on aircraft

00:14:59.120 --> 00:15:03.270 align:middle line:84%
recognition, bear in mind it's
the height of the Cold War.

00:15:03.270 --> 00:15:07.030 align:middle line:84%
He told me he was trained in
Soviet aircraft recognition as

00:15:07.030 --> 00:15:10.840 align:middle line:84%
well as anything that we might
have in terms of the United

00:15:10.840 --> 00:15:13.180 align:middle line:90%
States, the United Kingdom.

00:15:13.180 --> 00:15:16.390 align:middle line:84%
And he said this
was no Soviet craft.

00:15:16.390 --> 00:15:20.460 align:middle line:84%
In fact, this was no
craft of any type.

00:15:20.460 --> 00:15:21.040 align:middle line:90%
I mean this--

00:15:21.040 --> 00:15:22.180 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Of any human origin.

00:15:22.180 --> 00:15:22.700 align:middle line:90%
>>POPE: Yeah.

00:15:22.700 --> 00:15:23.283 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:15:23.283 --> 00:15:25.330 align:middle line:84%
So again, I mean, to me,
a lot of the evidence

00:15:25.330 --> 00:15:30.600 align:middle line:84%
comes from the feeling of it
and also the experience of it.

00:15:30.600 --> 00:15:35.030 align:middle line:84%
And that when they experience
this blast of white light

00:15:35.030 --> 00:15:37.750 align:middle line:84%
when he ran his hand over the
largest of one of these raised

00:15:37.750 --> 00:15:41.645 align:middle line:84%
symbols, something else
happened, too, didn't it?

00:15:41.645 --> 00:15:42.270 align:middle line:90%
>>POPE: It did.

00:15:42.270 --> 00:15:46.140 align:middle line:84%
And he-- the only way he can
really put this into words

00:15:46.140 --> 00:15:51.670 align:middle line:84%
is that it was as if there
was a flash into his mind,

00:15:51.670 --> 00:15:53.080 align:middle line:90%
into his consciousness.

00:15:53.080 --> 00:15:56.570 align:middle line:84%
And what he has
subsequently termed

00:15:56.570 --> 00:16:02.370 align:middle line:84%
a sort of telepathic
download of ones and zeroes.

00:16:02.370 --> 00:16:03.410 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Interesting.

00:16:03.410 --> 00:16:07.600 align:middle line:84%
>>POPE: And what happened was
that he put this from his mind

00:16:07.600 --> 00:16:08.400 align:middle line:90%
somehow.

00:16:08.400 --> 00:16:12.110 align:middle line:84%
Maybe it was suppressed
or repressed,

00:16:12.110 --> 00:16:14.710 align:middle line:90%
whichever of those techniques.

00:16:14.710 --> 00:16:17.430 align:middle line:84%
Two or three days
later, when he was back

00:16:17.430 --> 00:16:22.600 align:middle line:84%
at home, as if under
some sort of compulsion,

00:16:22.600 --> 00:16:26.190 align:middle line:84%
he again reached for
his police notebook.

00:16:26.190 --> 00:16:29.520 align:middle line:84%
And as if in a
trance, he wrote down

00:16:29.520 --> 00:16:30.995 align:middle line:90%
16 pages of ones and zeroes.

00:16:30.995 --> 00:16:33.120 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Yes, and we can
see what these look like.

00:16:33.120 --> 00:16:35.530 align:middle line:84%
Now, this was not common
language at the time--

00:16:35.530 --> 00:16:38.200 align:middle line:84%
the language of
the computer model.

00:16:38.200 --> 00:16:39.000 align:middle line:90%
>>POPE: No, indeed.

00:16:39.000 --> 00:16:41.960 align:middle line:84%
And he certainly
didn't recognize it

00:16:41.960 --> 00:16:45.450 align:middle line:84%
as what many people now
say must be binary code.

00:16:45.450 --> 00:16:46.000 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes

00:16:46.000 --> 00:16:48.590 align:middle line:84%
>>POPE: And this has been
dubbed the Rendlesham

00:16:48.590 --> 00:16:51.090 align:middle line:84%
Code, the Rendlesham
Binary Message,

00:16:51.090 --> 00:16:55.380 align:middle line:84%
whatever people in the UFO
community-- whatever phase

00:16:55.380 --> 00:16:56.300 align:middle line:90%
they use.

00:16:56.300 --> 00:16:59.820 align:middle line:84%
But there is huge amount
of interest and controversy

00:16:59.820 --> 00:17:01.110 align:middle line:90%
in this at present.

00:17:01.110 --> 00:17:02.010 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Absolutely.

00:17:02.010 --> 00:17:06.060 align:middle line:84%
Was there a message
that was deciphered?

00:17:06.060 --> 00:17:07.310 align:middle line:90%
>>POPE: There was.

00:17:07.310 --> 00:17:09.800 align:middle line:84%
A couple of years
ago, Jim Penniston

00:17:09.800 --> 00:17:13.140 align:middle line:90%
was taking part in a TV special.

00:17:13.140 --> 00:17:14.490 align:middle line:90%
And he was filming.

00:17:14.490 --> 00:17:18.349 align:middle line:84%
And in between takes, he
had out his police notebook.

00:17:18.349 --> 00:17:21.079 align:middle line:84%
And he was saying
to the director,

00:17:21.079 --> 00:17:24.480 align:middle line:84%
oh yes, you want to see
the sketch of the UFO

00:17:24.480 --> 00:17:27.460 align:middle line:84%
that I made and the
symbols on the side.

00:17:27.460 --> 00:17:29.060 align:middle line:90%
Let me find it for you.

00:17:29.060 --> 00:17:32.670 align:middle line:84%
And as he was flicking
through, suddenly he

00:17:32.670 --> 00:17:36.290 align:middle line:84%
got to be 16 pages
of ones and zeroes.

00:17:36.290 --> 00:17:40.040 align:middle line:84%
Somebody happened to be kind
of watching over his shoulder

00:17:40.040 --> 00:17:43.540 align:middle line:90%
and just said, Jim, what's that?

00:17:43.540 --> 00:17:47.970 align:middle line:84%
And Jim was like, oh, well, you
didn't really ask about that.

00:17:47.970 --> 00:17:52.880 align:middle line:84%
But if you must know, that's
that strange code message

00:17:52.880 --> 00:17:54.390 align:middle line:84%
that I got when I
touched the craft.

00:17:54.390 --> 00:17:56.960 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Was he reticent
to share that all along?

00:17:56.960 --> 00:17:59.249 align:middle line:84%
This was not easy for him
because he didn't understand

00:17:59.249 --> 00:18:00.540 align:middle line:90%
what had happened there, right?

00:18:00.540 --> 00:18:01.480 align:middle line:90%
>>POPE: Two reasons.

00:18:01.480 --> 00:18:04.160 align:middle line:84%
Firstly, he didn't
really understand

00:18:04.160 --> 00:18:05.390 align:middle line:90%
what he was dealing with.

00:18:05.390 --> 00:18:08.730 align:middle line:84%
But secondly and
far more immediately

00:18:08.730 --> 00:18:12.340 align:middle line:84%
in the aftermath of the
incident itself, Jim

00:18:12.340 --> 00:18:15.420 align:middle line:84%
had an exceptionally
high security clearance.

00:18:15.420 --> 00:18:21.160 align:middle line:84%
And he was also on what
was called PRP-- Personal

00:18:21.160 --> 00:18:23.540 align:middle line:90%
Reliability Program.

00:18:23.540 --> 00:18:26.370 align:middle line:84%
These were people who
had a high security

00:18:26.370 --> 00:18:31.220 align:middle line:84%
clearance and extra
layers of vetting.

00:18:31.220 --> 00:18:34.660 align:middle line:84%
And he basically-- the
way he's told this to me

00:18:34.660 --> 00:18:37.980 align:middle line:84%
is, like, if I'd have
said, oh, by the way, when

00:18:37.980 --> 00:18:39.770 align:middle line:84%
I touched the side
of this UFO, I

00:18:39.770 --> 00:18:41.650 align:middle line:84%
had this kind of
telepathic download,

00:18:41.650 --> 00:18:44.510 align:middle line:84%
he would have been
drummed out of the PRP

00:18:44.510 --> 00:18:47.300 align:middle line:84%
and maybe indeed the
United States Air

00:18:47.300 --> 00:18:51.370 align:middle line:84%
Force as a whole faster
than the blink of an eye.

00:18:51.370 --> 00:18:55.090 align:middle line:84%
So he made a conscious
decision back in 1980

00:18:55.090 --> 00:18:57.850 align:middle line:84%
not to say anything
about the code.

00:18:57.850 --> 00:19:01.360 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So now, here we are,
a couple of years ago, 2012ish,

00:19:01.360 --> 00:19:04.050 align:middle line:84%
and someone's looking over his
shoulder and sees this code.

00:19:04.050 --> 00:19:06.200 align:middle line:90%
Then what happened?

00:19:06.200 --> 00:19:10.630 align:middle line:84%
>>POPE: Well, at that point, the
TV production company thought,

00:19:10.630 --> 00:19:13.210 align:middle line:84%
well, we need to look
into this; let's get

00:19:13.210 --> 00:19:14.940 align:middle line:90%
hold of a computer expert.

00:19:14.940 --> 00:19:19.920 align:middle line:84%
And they got hold of this guy
who knew all about binary code.

00:19:19.920 --> 00:19:24.990 align:middle line:84%
They came up with this,
I suppose, translation.

00:19:24.990 --> 00:19:27.232 align:middle line:84%
And they simply put
this-- you know,

00:19:27.232 --> 00:19:28.940 align:middle line:84%
you can do this on
the internet yourself.

00:19:28.940 --> 00:19:31.440 align:middle line:84%
You can put in all
these ones and zeroes.

00:19:31.440 --> 00:19:38.320 align:middle line:84%
And there are websites that say
binary to text, text to binary.

00:19:38.320 --> 00:19:44.090 align:middle line:10%
And you got out this strange
message-- exploration

00:19:44.090 --> 00:19:50.970 align:middle line:10%
of humanity continuous for
planetary advance origin year

00:19:50.970 --> 00:19:57.100 align:middle line:10%
8,100 eyes of our
eyes-- and then

00:19:57.100 --> 00:20:01.390 align:middle line:10%
a series of what appeared
to be latitude and longitude

00:20:01.390 --> 00:20:04.930 align:middle line:10%
geographical coordinates
that just happened

00:20:04.930 --> 00:20:07.570 align:middle line:10%
to match a number
of I suppose you'd

00:20:07.570 --> 00:20:10.800 align:middle line:10%
call them power sites
of great significance

00:20:10.800 --> 00:20:15.061 align:middle line:10%
to people interested in
ancient wisdom, spirituality.

00:20:15.061 --> 00:20:16.560 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And what
were those sites?

00:20:16.560 --> 00:20:18.100 align:middle line:84%
>>POPE: The Great
Pyramid at Giza,

00:20:18.100 --> 00:20:25.280 align:middle line:84%
the Nazca Lines, the temple
of Apollo, and one of them

00:20:25.280 --> 00:20:28.820 align:middle line:84%
even turned out to be
coordinates associated

00:20:28.820 --> 00:20:33.620 align:middle line:84%
with Hy Brasil, which is
sometimes dubbed the Celtic

00:20:33.620 --> 00:20:36.720 align:middle line:84%
Atlantis-- this
mysterious Celtic legend

00:20:36.720 --> 00:20:38.494 align:middle line:90%
of this sunken continent.

00:20:38.494 --> 00:20:40.160 align:middle line:84%
And again, what's
interesting about that

00:20:40.160 --> 00:20:45.300 align:middle line:84%
is many cultures all around
the world quite independently

00:20:45.300 --> 00:20:53.120 align:middle line:84%
have this kind of central belief
of some prior civilization that

00:20:53.120 --> 00:20:55.642 align:middle line:84%
had great knowledge and power
and wisdom and technology.

00:20:55.642 --> 00:20:56.850 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: And this is global.

00:20:56.850 --> 00:20:59.690 align:middle line:84%
And it's embedded in all of
the ancient religions and texts

00:20:59.690 --> 00:21:00.390 align:middle line:90%
as well.

00:21:00.390 --> 00:21:00.890 align:middle line:90%
>>POPE: Yes.

00:21:00.890 --> 00:21:04.160 align:middle line:84%
And somehow as a result
of some great cataclysm--

00:21:04.160 --> 00:21:07.960 align:middle line:84%
often a flood, of course,
as we see in the Bible--

00:21:07.960 --> 00:21:11.490 align:middle line:90%
this civilization was destroyed.

00:21:11.490 --> 00:21:13.850 align:middle line:90%
The knowledge was somehow lost.

00:21:13.850 --> 00:21:16.630 align:middle line:84%
And this turned up again in
the so called Rendlesham Code.

00:21:16.630 --> 00:21:17.546 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Interesting.

00:21:17.546 --> 00:21:20.330 align:middle line:84%
Now, where-- what
was that location?

00:21:20.330 --> 00:21:25.710 align:middle line:84%
>>POPE: This is in the Atlantic
Ocean just off of the West

00:21:25.710 --> 00:21:29.675 align:middle line:84%
coast, I guess, of
Ireland, a bit further out.

00:21:29.675 --> 00:21:30.550 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Interesting

00:21:30.550 --> 00:21:34.240 align:middle line:84%
>>POPE: But Jim
Penniston really had

00:21:34.240 --> 00:21:39.700 align:middle line:84%
no interest in the
esoteric, in New Age.

00:21:39.700 --> 00:21:45.980 align:middle line:84%
He was a real no-nonsense senior
sergeant on security police

00:21:45.980 --> 00:21:50.150 align:middle line:84%
at these highly
sensitive military bases

00:21:50.150 --> 00:21:51.400 align:middle line:90%
at the height of the cold war.

00:21:51.400 --> 00:21:52.190 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:21:52.190 --> 00:21:55.030 align:middle line:84%
So this is-- yes, that wouldn't
have been his first concern.

00:21:55.030 --> 00:21:59.190 align:middle line:84%
But since that came to light
and since that decoding of sorts

00:21:59.190 --> 00:22:02.730 align:middle line:84%
occurred, has this
been handed over

00:22:02.730 --> 00:22:07.640 align:middle line:84%
to other groups of individuals
for further examination

00:22:07.640 --> 00:22:08.987 align:middle line:90%
and contemplation?

00:22:08.987 --> 00:22:09.820 align:middle line:90%
>>POPE: Yes, indeed.

00:22:09.820 --> 00:22:13.150 align:middle line:84%
In the TV show, and
I believe it was

00:22:13.150 --> 00:22:18.100 align:middle line:84%
the ubiquitous "Ancient
Aliens" that did this special,

00:22:18.100 --> 00:22:20.540 align:middle line:84%
we obviously had
this translation.

00:22:20.540 --> 00:22:26.560 align:middle line:10%
But a couple of years ago, John
Burroughs, Jim Penniston, and I

00:22:26.560 --> 00:22:29.750 align:middle line:10%
actually teamed up
and we wrote this book

00:22:29.750 --> 00:22:31.180 align:middle line:10%
"Encounter in
Rendlesham Forest."

00:22:31.180 --> 00:22:35.160 align:middle line:10%
And we took the decision
that not withstanding

00:22:35.160 --> 00:22:40.880 align:middle line:10%
what "Ancient Aliens" had done
in hiring their own expert,

00:22:40.880 --> 00:22:45.410 align:middle line:10%
this was not on all
16 pages of the code.

00:22:45.410 --> 00:22:46.920 align:middle line:84%
For a number of
reasons, I think,

00:22:46.920 --> 00:22:49.064 align:middle line:84%
Jim was still
reluctant to make--

00:22:49.064 --> 00:22:51.480 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: How many pages of
code did he allow them to see?

00:22:51.480 --> 00:22:54.860 align:middle line:84%
>>POPE: I'm not sure
how many they looked at.

00:22:54.860 --> 00:22:58.440 align:middle line:84%
But suffice to say
that in our book,

00:22:58.440 --> 00:23:04.310 align:middle line:84%
we took the decision to publish
for the first time all 16 pages

00:23:04.310 --> 00:23:07.210 align:middle line:84%
exactly as they
appeared in his notebook

00:23:07.210 --> 00:23:11.030 align:middle line:84%
rather than just snippets
of them or translations.

00:23:11.030 --> 00:23:15.800 align:middle line:84%
And the reason we did that
is we wanted the UFO research

00:23:15.800 --> 00:23:19.420 align:middle line:84%
community, we wanted
the esoteric community,

00:23:19.420 --> 00:23:23.990 align:middle line:84%
to have the raw data and to
say, look, a number of people

00:23:23.990 --> 00:23:25.200 align:middle line:90%
have had a go at this.

00:23:25.200 --> 00:23:26.140 align:middle line:90%
You have a go.

00:23:26.140 --> 00:23:27.014 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:23:27.014 --> 00:23:28.430 align:middle line:84%
>>POPE: See what
you make of this.

00:23:28.430 --> 00:23:30.570 align:middle line:84%
We didn't want to
keep this secret.

00:23:30.570 --> 00:23:35.430 align:middle line:84%
We didn't want, if this was some
message, to set ourselves up

00:23:35.430 --> 00:23:37.002 align:middle line:90%
as custodians of it.

00:23:37.002 --> 00:23:37.710 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Exactly

00:23:37.710 --> 00:23:40.209 align:middle line:84%
>>POPE: We felt that if there
was an important message here,

00:23:40.209 --> 00:23:41.520 align:middle line:90%
it was a message for everyone.

00:23:41.520 --> 00:23:44.940 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: That was generous,
brilliant in its transparency.

00:23:44.940 --> 00:23:47.470 align:middle line:84%
And have you since
been receiving

00:23:47.470 --> 00:23:50.744 align:middle line:84%
various-- varied
interpretations of it?

00:23:50.744 --> 00:23:51.410 align:middle line:90%
>>POPE: We have.

00:23:51.410 --> 00:23:52.600 align:middle line:90%
And there's a lot out there.

00:23:52.600 --> 00:23:54.560 align:middle line:84%
I mean, I think if--
I don't want to--

00:23:54.560 --> 00:23:55.351 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: We won't.

00:23:55.351 --> 00:23:58.070 align:middle line:84%
>>POPE: --in a sense
favor any one translation.

00:23:58.070 --> 00:23:59.690 align:middle line:84%
But suffice to
say, again, if you

00:23:59.690 --> 00:24:03.580 align:middle line:84%
Google phrases such as the
Rendlesham Code, the Rendlesham

00:24:03.580 --> 00:24:05.810 align:middle line:84%
Binary Message,
you'll find a number

00:24:05.810 --> 00:24:08.320 align:middle line:90%
of websites devoted to it.

00:24:08.320 --> 00:24:11.240 align:middle line:84%
And a number of
esoteric researchers

00:24:11.240 --> 00:24:13.640 align:middle line:84%
are bringing their own
very considerable knowledge

00:24:13.640 --> 00:24:15.600 align:middle line:90%
and experience to bear on this.

00:24:15.600 --> 00:24:17.690 align:middle line:90%
And it's exciting times.

00:24:17.690 --> 00:24:19.150 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes, very exciting.

00:24:19.150 --> 00:24:21.030 align:middle line:84%
I mean, to me, that's
one of the most

00:24:21.030 --> 00:24:22.730 align:middle line:90%
juicy parts of that whole story.

00:24:22.730 --> 00:24:24.040 align:middle line:90%
>>POPE: It is.

00:24:24.040 --> 00:24:27.900 align:middle line:84%
And not withstanding
this translation,

00:24:27.900 --> 00:24:33.730 align:middle line:84%
continuous advancement,
et cetera, et cetera,

00:24:33.730 --> 00:24:36.400 align:middle line:90%
I can't help but wonder.

00:24:36.400 --> 00:24:39.230 align:middle line:84%
If there's a real
message there, maybe it's

00:24:39.230 --> 00:24:40.820 align:middle line:90%
buried a little bit deeper.

00:24:40.820 --> 00:24:43.000 align:middle line:84%
Maybe it's a little
bit more subtle.

00:24:43.000 --> 00:24:44.500 align:middle line:84%
Again, that's one
of the reasons we

00:24:44.500 --> 00:24:47.317 align:middle line:84%
decided to put the
raw data out there.

00:24:47.317 --> 00:24:47.900 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:24:47.900 --> 00:24:51.360 align:middle line:84%
>>POPE: Now, of course,
this phrase that crops up,

00:24:51.360 --> 00:24:53.210 align:middle line:90%
origin year 8400--

00:24:53.210 --> 00:24:55.850 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Yes, that's
what struck me.

00:24:55.850 --> 00:24:58.540 align:middle line:90%
From what point?

00:24:58.540 --> 00:25:00.530 align:middle line:84%
>>POPE: What this has
lead to, of course,

00:25:00.530 --> 00:25:03.490 align:middle line:84%
is a number of people
suggesting that what we're

00:25:03.490 --> 00:25:07.910 align:middle line:84%
dealing with here is not,
as some people believe,

00:25:07.910 --> 00:25:12.090 align:middle line:84%
extraterrestrials, but perhaps
time travelers from the future.

00:25:12.090 --> 00:25:14.480 align:middle line:90%
Now, I can't really say.

00:25:14.480 --> 00:25:19.350 align:middle line:84%
I mean, my take is until we
have a definitive answer,

00:25:19.350 --> 00:25:23.030 align:middle line:84%
I don't think any of us should
be so arrogant as to say,

00:25:23.030 --> 00:25:24.600 align:middle line:90%
here's what it was.

00:25:24.600 --> 00:25:26.450 align:middle line:90%
We've cracked the code.

00:25:26.450 --> 00:25:29.070 align:middle line:90%
We've solved the mystery.

00:25:29.070 --> 00:25:30.240 align:middle line:90%
I don't know.

00:25:30.240 --> 00:25:33.860 align:middle line:84%
But again, I think the
interesting thing about this

00:25:33.860 --> 00:25:36.130 align:middle line:90%
is it throws open the debate.

00:25:36.130 --> 00:25:40.090 align:middle line:84%
For years and years,
the only question

00:25:40.090 --> 00:25:45.000 align:middle line:84%
was this kind of believer
versus skeptic dog fight over,

00:25:45.000 --> 00:25:48.275 align:middle line:84%
is it aliens, or is it
just something conventional

00:25:48.275 --> 00:25:49.600 align:middle line:90%
we've misidentified?

00:25:49.600 --> 00:25:51.100 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: That's a
really big point.

00:25:51.100 --> 00:25:53.820 align:middle line:84%
Because in all the
interviews I do

00:25:53.820 --> 00:25:58.370 align:middle line:84%
and all the stories I encounter
which are always intriguing,

00:25:58.370 --> 00:26:01.850 align:middle line:84%
the one thing that comes up is
the need for nuanced thinking

00:26:01.850 --> 00:26:03.232 align:middle line:90%
now, across the board.

00:26:03.232 --> 00:26:04.940 align:middle line:84%
It doesn't really
matter what the subject

00:26:04.940 --> 00:26:07.250 align:middle line:90%
is, and certainly in ufology.

00:26:07.250 --> 00:26:11.230 align:middle line:84%
Because we tend to want to
fall into one camp or another

00:26:11.230 --> 00:26:12.690 align:middle line:90%
to make it easy on ourselves.

00:26:12.690 --> 00:26:16.220 align:middle line:84%
Somehow, I don't know what
it is in human beings that

00:26:16.220 --> 00:26:20.200 align:middle line:84%
feel their mind can't handle
subtleties and conflicts

00:26:20.200 --> 00:26:22.050 align:middle line:84%
with a fair amount
of confidence.

00:26:22.050 --> 00:26:23.620 align:middle line:84%
But that's what's
really required now

00:26:23.620 --> 00:26:25.110 align:middle line:90%
in these examinations.

00:26:25.110 --> 00:26:26.720 align:middle line:90%
>>POPE: I think so.

00:26:26.720 --> 00:26:29.820 align:middle line:90%
We do like to label things.

00:26:29.820 --> 00:26:33.680 align:middle line:84%
And we do like to put things
into very specific pigeon

00:26:33.680 --> 00:26:34.460 align:middle line:90%
holes.

00:26:34.460 --> 00:26:36.480 align:middle line:84%
So with Rendlesham
Forest, some people

00:26:36.480 --> 00:26:38.860 align:middle line:90%
put it in the alien pigeonhole.

00:26:38.860 --> 00:26:41.570 align:middle line:84%
Others will put it in the
time travel pigeonhole.

00:26:41.570 --> 00:26:46.120 align:middle line:84%
Others will speculate about
other dimensions and things

00:26:46.120 --> 00:26:47.509 align:middle line:90%
like that.

00:26:47.509 --> 00:26:49.050 align:middle line:84%
A few years ago,
that might have been

00:26:49.050 --> 00:26:51.200 align:middle line:90%
regarded as science fiction.

00:26:51.200 --> 00:26:52.860 align:middle line:84%
I guess some of
the things going on

00:26:52.860 --> 00:26:54.110 align:middle line:90%
at the large hadron collider--

00:26:54.110 --> 00:26:55.010 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Oh yes.

00:26:55.010 --> 00:26:56.779 align:middle line:84%
That's not science
fiction any longer.

00:26:56.779 --> 00:26:57.570 align:middle line:90%
>>POPE: No, indeed.

00:26:57.570 --> 00:26:58.445 align:middle line:90%
We can rethink all that.

00:26:58.445 --> 00:26:59.569 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah, absolutely.

00:26:59.569 --> 00:27:03.500 align:middle line:10%
>>POPE: But I'm not a
great one for these labels.

00:27:03.500 --> 00:27:07.745 align:middle line:10%
And I can't help but wonder
that if there is ever

00:27:07.745 --> 00:27:12.690 align:middle line:10%
a great parting of the curtain
moment and a great revelation--

00:27:12.690 --> 00:27:16.120 align:middle line:10%
here it is, this is what it
is-- I can't help but think

00:27:16.120 --> 00:27:18.390 align:middle line:10%
that we'll all go, oh.

00:27:18.390 --> 00:27:21.480 align:middle line:84%
So it was something completely
different all along,

00:27:21.480 --> 00:27:24.840 align:middle line:84%
something maybe that we
don't have the words for.

00:27:24.840 --> 00:27:28.017 align:middle line:84%
We perhaps haven't even
begun to conceptualize yet.

00:27:28.017 --> 00:27:28.600 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:27:28.600 --> 00:27:30.058 align:middle line:84%
And to have the
humility to just be

00:27:30.058 --> 00:27:33.431 align:middle line:84%
comfortable with waiting until
it's obvious-- and exploring.

00:27:33.431 --> 00:27:34.930 align:middle line:84%
There's nothing
wrong with exploring

00:27:34.930 --> 00:27:36.320 align:middle line:90%
all of these possibilities.

00:27:36.320 --> 00:27:37.820 align:middle line:90%
I'm all for that.

00:27:37.820 --> 00:27:41.330 align:middle line:84%
But not to necessarily
attach too heavily

00:27:41.330 --> 00:27:43.680 align:middle line:84%
to where it becomes
dogma in and of itself.

00:27:43.680 --> 00:27:44.180 align:middle line:90%
>>POPE: Yes.

00:27:44.180 --> 00:27:47.390 align:middle line:84%
And I think we can't-- in a
sense, we can't help this.

00:27:47.390 --> 00:27:50.160 align:middle line:84%
Because inevitably,
we bring with us

00:27:50.160 --> 00:27:56.640 align:middle line:84%
baggage in terms of our cultural
background, our knowledge,

00:27:56.640 --> 00:27:58.080 align:middle line:90%
our belief system.

00:27:58.080 --> 00:28:01.150 align:middle line:84%
And I'm not the first
one to make this analogy.

00:28:01.150 --> 00:28:03.540 align:middle line:84%
But if you were to wake up
in the middle of the night

00:28:03.540 --> 00:28:07.060 align:middle line:84%
and see a shadowy at
the foot of your bed,

00:28:07.060 --> 00:28:10.960 align:middle line:84%
paranormal researchers
might think ghost.

00:28:10.960 --> 00:28:13.560 align:middle line:84%
UFO researchers
might think alien.

00:28:13.560 --> 00:28:15.840 align:middle line:84%
Religious people
might think angel.

00:28:15.840 --> 00:28:18.260 align:middle line:90%
And again, these are all labels.

00:28:18.260 --> 00:28:19.930 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes, absolutely.

00:28:19.930 --> 00:28:21.750 align:middle line:84%
OK, well, thank
you for taking time

00:28:21.750 --> 00:28:24.870 align:middle line:84%
to flesh that code out
a little bit for us.

00:28:24.870 --> 00:28:27.590 align:middle line:84%
And now we're going to go
back to the diagram of what

00:28:27.590 --> 00:28:29.000 align:middle line:90%
happened that evening.

00:28:29.000 --> 00:28:30.130 align:middle line:90%
What are blotters?

00:28:30.130 --> 00:28:33.520 align:middle line:84%
And right here, I
ask the questions,

00:28:33.520 --> 00:28:35.122 align:middle line:90%
when did they go missing?

00:28:35.122 --> 00:28:36.580 align:middle line:84%
Because most of us
have never heard

00:28:36.580 --> 00:28:38.020 align:middle line:90%
the term blotter to begin with.

00:28:38.020 --> 00:28:41.020 align:middle line:84%
And why is this
significant to this story?

00:28:41.020 --> 00:28:46.500 align:middle line:84%
>>POPE: Blotters are effectively
just kind of notebooks, pads.

00:28:46.500 --> 00:28:50.700 align:middle line:84%
And when something
happens, duty staff

00:28:50.700 --> 00:28:52.850 align:middle line:90%
will write it onto the blotters.

00:28:52.850 --> 00:28:54.930 align:middle line:90%
So there are security blotters.

00:28:54.930 --> 00:28:59.700 align:middle line:84%
There are police blotters, a
number of different blotters.

00:28:59.700 --> 00:29:04.740 align:middle line:84%
And the important thing is that
it's a record of what happened.

00:29:04.740 --> 00:29:10.360 align:middle line:84%
Now, John and Jim, after
this spectacular encounter,

00:29:10.360 --> 00:29:13.960 align:middle line:84%
they're just left
shaking their heads.

00:29:13.960 --> 00:29:15.230 align:middle line:90%
They return to base.

00:29:15.230 --> 00:29:17.660 align:middle line:84%
They say, what the
heck are we going

00:29:17.660 --> 00:29:19.840 align:middle line:90%
to tell anyone about this?

00:29:19.840 --> 00:29:20.820 align:middle line:90%
They won't believe us.

00:29:20.820 --> 00:29:24.000 align:middle line:84%
And so they think, well, what's
the least they can get away

00:29:24.000 --> 00:29:24.510 align:middle line:90%
with?

00:29:24.510 --> 00:29:26.210 align:middle line:84%
Well, we saw some
strange lights.

00:29:26.210 --> 00:29:30.470 align:middle line:84%
We did see a craft, but
we couldn't identify it.

00:29:30.470 --> 00:29:33.440 align:middle line:84%
We'll kick it up the
chain of command.

00:29:33.440 --> 00:29:36.640 align:middle line:84%
When they got back,
they found that the base

00:29:36.640 --> 00:29:38.710 align:middle line:84%
was in a state of
absolute panic.

00:29:38.710 --> 00:29:44.180 align:middle line:84%
And they had been gone for
longer than they believed.

00:29:44.180 --> 00:29:47.620 align:middle line:84%
And there was a discrepancy in
terms of their wrist watches

00:29:47.620 --> 00:29:51.820 align:middle line:84%
and the time back at base
of around about 45 minutes.

00:29:51.820 --> 00:29:53.920 align:middle line:84%
And indeed, they
were on the point

00:29:53.920 --> 00:29:57.110 align:middle line:84%
of sending search parties
out to look for them.

00:29:57.110 --> 00:30:00.510 align:middle line:84%
I mean, again, operational
military bases,

00:30:00.510 --> 00:30:06.020 align:middle line:84%
two of the most strategically
vital bases in the entire NATO

00:30:06.020 --> 00:30:09.770 align:middle line:84%
alliance at the height of the
Cold War, people going out

00:30:09.770 --> 00:30:13.060 align:middle line:84%
to investigate what
was classified.

00:30:13.060 --> 00:30:14.530 align:middle line:90%
No one was talking UFOs.

00:30:14.530 --> 00:30:16.650 align:middle line:90%
It was a security situation.

00:30:16.650 --> 00:30:19.050 align:middle line:90%
And the people go missing.

00:30:19.050 --> 00:30:22.780 align:middle line:84%
You can well understand why this
was a cause of huge concern.

00:30:22.780 --> 00:30:27.110 align:middle line:84%
Well, suffice to say, they
go back in the nick of time.

00:30:27.110 --> 00:30:29.470 align:middle line:84%
The information
or the basic story

00:30:29.470 --> 00:30:33.240 align:middle line:84%
that they encountered
something unknown out there

00:30:33.240 --> 00:30:36.970 align:middle line:84%
was written onto the police
and the security blotters.

00:30:36.970 --> 00:30:41.380 align:middle line:84%
But within 24 hours, those
blotters went missing.

00:30:41.380 --> 00:30:46.900 align:middle line:84%
Somebody had somehow entered
the secure area-- or maybe they

00:30:46.900 --> 00:30:52.990 align:middle line:84%
worked there already in the
first place-- and spirited away

00:30:52.990 --> 00:30:56.860 align:middle line:84%
one of the most
important, I suppose,

00:30:56.860 --> 00:31:00.640 align:middle line:84%
initial documentation
of what happened.

00:31:00.640 --> 00:31:05.920 align:middle line:84%
Now, subsequently, a whole
bunch of different witnesses

00:31:05.920 --> 00:31:10.140 align:middle line:84%
were told to write up
statements of what happened.

00:31:10.140 --> 00:31:12.770 align:middle line:84%
And there were five
witness statements.

00:31:12.770 --> 00:31:15.010 align:middle line:90%
But these are a complete mess.

00:31:15.010 --> 00:31:17.662 align:middle line:84%
Some of the witnesses
say, I didn't write it.

00:31:17.662 --> 00:31:18.870 align:middle line:90%
Some of them are handwritten.

00:31:18.870 --> 00:31:19.630 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Oh yes.

00:31:19.630 --> 00:31:20.130 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

00:31:20.130 --> 00:31:21.421 align:middle line:90%
>>POPE: Some of them are typed.

00:31:21.421 --> 00:31:22.766 align:middle line:90%
Not all of them are dated.

00:31:22.766 --> 00:31:24.140 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Yes,
we're going to get

00:31:24.140 --> 00:31:25.810 align:middle line:90%
into that whole aspect of it.

00:31:25.810 --> 00:31:26.310 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:31:26.310 --> 00:31:29.880 align:middle line:84%
So the blotters went missing
that had the original accounts.

00:31:29.880 --> 00:31:34.680 align:middle line:84%
In addition to that, they sent
the film to the Air Force lab.

00:31:34.680 --> 00:31:35.330 align:middle line:90%
>>POPE: Yes.

00:31:35.330 --> 00:31:37.590 align:middle line:84%
This was really the
only first night of--

00:31:37.590 --> 00:31:39.270 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Oh, that's
my next question.

00:31:39.270 --> 00:31:41.776 align:middle line:84%
So please continue
on right now, yes.

00:31:41.776 --> 00:31:43.150 align:middle line:84%
>>POPE: I can do
the second night

00:31:43.150 --> 00:31:45.960 align:middle line:84%
quite quickly because
comparatively little is

00:31:45.960 --> 00:31:46.950 align:middle line:90%
known about this.

00:31:46.950 --> 00:31:53.690 align:middle line:84%
But after John and Jim's
encounter on the first night,

00:31:53.690 --> 00:31:58.620 align:middle line:84%
there was a second night
where, really, balls of light

00:31:58.620 --> 00:32:04.410 align:middle line:84%
were seen by completely
different bunch of security

00:32:04.410 --> 00:32:06.760 align:middle line:84%
police, law
enforcement personnel.

00:32:06.760 --> 00:32:08.550 align:middle line:90%
Again, all military witnesses.

00:32:08.550 --> 00:32:11.080 align:middle line:90%
But really, balls of light.

00:32:11.080 --> 00:32:14.460 align:middle line:84%
But the sighting which
was of most, I suppose,

00:32:14.460 --> 00:32:19.910 align:middle line:84%
concern was that two of the
security police personnel were

00:32:19.910 --> 00:32:23.510 align:middle line:84%
driving a Jeep
through the forest,

00:32:23.510 --> 00:32:27.020 align:middle line:84%
travelling towards the location
where some of these balls

00:32:27.020 --> 00:32:29.130 align:middle line:90%
of light had been seen.

00:32:29.130 --> 00:32:34.660 align:middle line:84%
And they had the windows
open in the cab up front.

00:32:34.660 --> 00:32:39.950 align:middle line:84%
And a ball of light flew
through the open window

00:32:39.950 --> 00:32:44.180 align:middle line:84%
on one side, passed
directly in front,

00:32:44.180 --> 00:32:46.770 align:middle line:84%
just inches from
the faces of the two

00:32:46.770 --> 00:32:51.250 align:middle line:84%
people in the front cab, and out
again through the open window

00:32:51.250 --> 00:32:53.360 align:middle line:90%
the other side.

00:32:53.360 --> 00:32:56.860 align:middle line:84%
Suffice to say that one
of the people on duty who

00:32:56.860 --> 00:33:02.260 align:middle line:84%
was a lieutenant was so
shocked by this and clearly

00:33:02.260 --> 00:33:07.690 align:middle line:84%
in a state of shock that they
had to be taken off duty.

00:33:07.690 --> 00:33:10.825 align:middle line:90%
And everyone was just stunned--

00:33:10.825 --> 00:33:11.450 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right

00:33:11.450 --> 00:33:12.210 align:middle line:90%
>>POPE: --by this.

00:33:12.210 --> 00:33:16.580 align:middle line:84%
But for a number of
reasons, these witnesses

00:33:16.580 --> 00:33:22.120 align:middle line:84%
from the second night, which
I call the intermediary night,

00:33:22.120 --> 00:33:25.380 align:middle line:84%
have been reluctant
to come forward.

00:33:25.380 --> 00:33:29.910 align:middle line:84%
The third night involved
the return of the UFO

00:33:29.910 --> 00:33:33.460 align:middle line:84%
and-- I mentioned him right at
the beginning-- the involvement

00:33:33.460 --> 00:33:36.770 align:middle line:84%
of the deputy base commander
whose name was the Lieutenant

00:33:36.770 --> 00:33:38.270 align:middle line:90%
Colonel Charles Halt.

00:33:38.270 --> 00:33:39.200 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:33:39.200 --> 00:33:41.210 align:middle line:84%
Now, he's a really
key player here.

00:33:41.210 --> 00:33:43.130 align:middle line:84%
We're going to get to
Halt in just a moment.

00:33:43.130 --> 00:33:46.640 align:middle line:84%
I wanted to ask you about--
one of the people reported

00:33:46.640 --> 00:33:50.050 align:middle line:90%
to Colonel Ted Conrad, right?

00:33:50.050 --> 00:33:50.570 align:middle line:90%
>>POPE: Yes.

00:33:50.570 --> 00:33:53.620 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And Conrad
was at a social affair

00:33:53.620 --> 00:33:57.800 align:middle line:84%
and chose not to
respond at all to this.

00:33:57.800 --> 00:33:58.300 align:middle line:90%
>>POPE: Yes.

00:33:58.300 --> 00:34:01.390 align:middle line:84%
This is what happened
on the third night.

00:34:01.390 --> 00:34:03.420 align:middle line:84%
And what happened,
as you say, there

00:34:03.420 --> 00:34:08.010 align:middle line:84%
was this social function which
was in fact an awards ceremony.

00:34:08.010 --> 00:34:10.889 align:middle line:84%
And it was just
about to get underway

00:34:10.889 --> 00:34:14.370 align:middle line:84%
when the door was burst open
and one of the junior officers

00:34:14.370 --> 00:34:21.469 align:middle line:84%
came up and found Ted Conrad
and Charles Halt together.

00:34:21.469 --> 00:34:25.060 align:middle line:84%
Now, Ted Conrad was
the base commander.

00:34:25.060 --> 00:34:28.239 align:middle line:84%
Charles Halt was a
deputy base commander.

00:34:28.239 --> 00:34:31.270 align:middle line:84%
And even these
terminologies are a little

00:34:31.270 --> 00:34:33.900 align:middle line:84%
misleading to people without
a military background

00:34:33.900 --> 00:34:37.210 align:middle line:84%
because senior to them
was Gordon Williams, who

00:34:37.210 --> 00:34:38.650 align:middle line:90%
was the wing commander.

00:34:38.650 --> 00:34:42.270 align:middle line:84%
So he was in overall
command of the twin bases.

00:34:42.270 --> 00:34:45.830 align:middle line:84%
But on this night and
at this social function,

00:34:45.830 --> 00:34:50.380 align:middle line:84%
Ted Conrad and Charles Halt were
the senior ranking officers.

00:34:50.380 --> 00:34:54.830 align:middle line:84%
So the young airman saluted
and said, sir, it's back.

00:34:54.830 --> 00:34:57.080 align:middle line:84%
And there was a, you
know, well, what's back?

00:34:57.080 --> 00:34:58.790 align:middle line:90%
What are you talking about?

00:34:58.790 --> 00:35:00.120 align:middle line:90%
The UFO, sir.

00:35:00.120 --> 00:35:02.780 align:middle line:84%
The UFO that's been
seen previously.

00:35:02.780 --> 00:35:04.230 align:middle line:90%
It's come back.

00:35:04.230 --> 00:35:10.610 align:middle line:84%
Ted Conrad decided that Halt
should go and investigate.

00:35:10.610 --> 00:35:13.310 align:middle line:84%
Now, maybe this
was because Conrad

00:35:13.310 --> 00:35:16.880 align:middle line:84%
felt that his place was
at the award ceremony

00:35:16.880 --> 00:35:20.560 align:middle line:84%
and that the senior ranking
officer should be handing out

00:35:20.560 --> 00:35:21.230 align:middle line:90%
the awards.

00:35:21.230 --> 00:35:25.580 align:middle line:84%
Or maybe it was simply because
it was a cold, miserable night

00:35:25.580 --> 00:35:27.810 align:middle line:90%
in the English countryside.

00:35:27.810 --> 00:35:30.880 align:middle line:84%
And after all, rank
has its privileges.

00:35:30.880 --> 00:35:35.150 align:middle line:84%
But for whatever reason,
Conrad said to Halt,

00:35:35.150 --> 00:35:36.960 align:middle line:90%
you deal with this.

00:35:36.960 --> 00:35:41.810 align:middle line:84%
So Halt threw together a team
of about half a dozen people.

00:35:41.810 --> 00:35:43.830 align:middle line:90%
And he went out into the forest.

00:35:43.830 --> 00:35:48.670 align:middle line:84%
In his words, he said, I'm going
to debunk this UFO nonsense,

00:35:48.670 --> 00:35:52.390 align:middle line:84%
put this crazy business to
bed for once and for all.

00:35:52.390 --> 00:35:54.790 align:middle line:90%
Well, that didn't end up.

00:35:54.790 --> 00:35:57.741 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: He turned out to be
the better choice of the two.

00:35:57.741 --> 00:35:58.740 align:middle line:90%
>>POPE: Yes, I think so.

00:35:58.740 --> 00:35:59.281 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes

00:35:59.281 --> 00:36:00.860 align:middle line:84%
>>POPE: Though, of
course, had Conrad

00:36:00.860 --> 00:36:03.920 align:middle line:84%
actually seen this and
experienced this, who knows?

00:36:03.920 --> 00:36:08.490 align:middle line:84%
Maybe he would have ended
up where Halt is now.

00:36:08.490 --> 00:36:13.620 align:middle line:84%
Halt said, you know, if there's
anything out in the forest,

00:36:13.620 --> 00:36:19.400 align:middle line:84%
I want to light this whole
area up and flush it out.

00:36:19.400 --> 00:36:23.280 align:middle line:84%
So he ordered what
are called light-alls

00:36:23.280 --> 00:36:24.750 align:middle line:90%
to be taken into the forest.

00:36:24.750 --> 00:36:27.010 align:middle line:84%
And these are just basically
very powerful lights

00:36:27.010 --> 00:36:32.580 align:middle line:84%
which you can drag or
drive on a flatbed vehicle.

00:36:32.580 --> 00:36:35.700 align:middle line:90%
And he called for these things.

00:36:35.700 --> 00:36:38.540 align:middle line:84%
And as they went
out into the forest,

00:36:38.540 --> 00:36:42.280 align:middle line:84%
all these lights began
to splutter and die.

00:36:42.280 --> 00:36:45.420 align:middle line:84%
A bit like the radios
back on the first night.

00:36:45.420 --> 00:36:51.510 align:middle line:84%
Well, Halt was in a
state of disbelief

00:36:51.510 --> 00:36:53.040 align:middle line:90%
and a little bit of anger.

00:36:53.040 --> 00:36:54.030 align:middle line:90%
And he was like, what?

00:36:54.030 --> 00:36:55.810 align:middle line:90%
Aren't these fueled properly?

00:36:55.810 --> 00:36:57.420 align:middle line:90%
Get this sorted out now.

00:36:57.420 --> 00:37:01.580 align:middle line:84%
And there was dozens
of people out there.

00:37:01.580 --> 00:37:04.330 align:middle line:84%
People are running around
like headless chickens

00:37:04.330 --> 00:37:07.040 align:middle line:90%
going back to the fueling depot.

00:37:07.040 --> 00:37:09.300 align:middle line:84%
These things seem to
be properly fueled.

00:37:09.300 --> 00:37:11.380 align:middle line:84%
There didn't seem
to be obvious signs

00:37:11.380 --> 00:37:13.950 align:middle line:90%
of any technical malfunction.

00:37:13.950 --> 00:37:18.890 align:middle line:84%
But just every time they tried
to get them out, they cut out.

00:37:18.890 --> 00:37:21.740 align:middle line:84%
So anyway, Halt decided
while he was waiting

00:37:21.740 --> 00:37:24.690 align:middle line:84%
for these light-alls
to be sorted out,

00:37:24.690 --> 00:37:28.790 align:middle line:84%
he would go back to where it
all began on the first night

00:37:28.790 --> 00:37:32.410 align:middle line:84%
to where Jim and John
had had their encounter.

00:37:32.410 --> 00:37:35.910 align:middle line:84%
So he went out to the
clearing with his team.

00:37:35.910 --> 00:37:40.140 align:middle line:84%
And at that point, they couldn't
see anything unusual themselves

00:37:40.140 --> 00:37:44.030 align:middle line:84%
in terms of the UFO that
they'd been told had returned.

00:37:44.030 --> 00:37:47.040 align:middle line:84%
So he started to
document what could

00:37:47.040 --> 00:37:49.070 align:middle line:90%
be witnessed in the clearing.

00:37:49.070 --> 00:37:51.610 align:middle line:84%
And sure enough, exactly
where Jim and John

00:37:51.610 --> 00:37:53.330 align:middle line:84%
said that they'd
encountered this UFO

00:37:53.330 --> 00:37:56.665 align:middle line:84%
were three indentations
in the ground.

00:37:56.665 --> 00:38:00.830 align:middle line:84%
Now, the ground was really
hard and frozen solid.

00:38:00.830 --> 00:38:04.760 align:middle line:84%
And these fresh marks
suggested to Halt

00:38:04.760 --> 00:38:07.739 align:middle line:84%
there's an object weighing
several tons had--

00:38:07.739 --> 00:38:09.280 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Even though
it was so tiny.

00:38:09.280 --> 00:38:10.710 align:middle line:90%
>>POPE: Absolutely.

00:38:10.710 --> 00:38:12.230 align:middle line:90%
It had been there.

00:38:12.230 --> 00:38:17.510 align:middle line:84%
And later on, people
poured plaster of Paris

00:38:17.510 --> 00:38:22.400 align:middle line:84%
into this to get a mold of it
as part of the investigation,

00:38:22.400 --> 00:38:26.840 align:middle line:84%
as part of the attempt to
document what they could

00:38:26.840 --> 00:38:30.770 align:middle line:84%
discern about this object
from the trace evidence

00:38:30.770 --> 00:38:32.670 align:middle line:90%
that they had.

00:38:32.670 --> 00:38:36.790 align:middle line:84%
But the real critical thing
that Halt did at that point

00:38:36.790 --> 00:38:39.910 align:middle line:84%
is that he had with
him Monroe Nevilles.

00:38:39.910 --> 00:38:42.970 align:middle line:84%
Monroe Nevilles was the
disaster preparedness officer.

00:38:42.970 --> 00:38:45.540 align:middle line:84%
And he had with him
a Geiger counter.

00:38:45.540 --> 00:38:49.090 align:middle line:90%
And they swept the area.

00:38:49.090 --> 00:38:52.920 align:middle line:84%
And sure enough,
right in the middle

00:38:52.920 --> 00:38:55.560 align:middle line:84%
of the clearing
where this thing had

00:38:55.560 --> 00:39:00.310 align:middle line:84%
been seen to land, and
particularly in these three

00:39:00.310 --> 00:39:07.990 align:middle line:84%
indentations, they got spikes,
peak readings of radioactivity.

00:39:07.990 --> 00:39:11.810 align:middle line:84%
And all around the edge
of this small clearing,

00:39:11.810 --> 00:39:13.720 align:middle line:90%
there were trees.

00:39:13.720 --> 00:39:17.780 align:middle line:84%
And the inward facing
sides of these trees

00:39:17.780 --> 00:39:20.810 align:middle line:90%
were visibly scorched.

00:39:20.810 --> 00:39:25.090 align:middle line:84%
And again, there was
high radioactivity

00:39:25.090 --> 00:39:27.700 align:middle line:84%
found on the inward
sides of the trees.

00:39:27.700 --> 00:39:28.780 align:middle line:90%
Not the outwards.

00:39:28.780 --> 00:39:31.540 align:middle line:84%
The outward facing
bits were fine.

00:39:31.540 --> 00:39:36.450 align:middle line:84%
But not just visible
blackened scorch marks,

00:39:36.450 --> 00:39:41.210 align:middle line:84%
but high levels of
radioactivity, clearly as if

00:39:41.210 --> 00:39:45.770 align:middle line:84%
a high heat source and a
source of high radioactivity

00:39:45.770 --> 00:39:46.620 align:middle line:90%
had been there.

00:39:46.620 --> 00:39:51.070 align:middle line:84%
Was this associated, again
as I speculated earlier,

00:39:51.070 --> 00:39:56.320 align:middle line:84%
with some sort of exotic energy
source or propulsion system?

00:39:56.320 --> 00:39:58.670 align:middle line:84%
It's speculation,
but I think it's

00:39:58.670 --> 00:40:02.560 align:middle line:84%
a fairly sound piece
of speculation.

00:40:02.560 --> 00:40:06.870 align:middle line:90%
Something anomalous caused that.

00:40:06.870 --> 00:40:09.770 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And the beauty
of Halt being there

00:40:09.770 --> 00:40:12.540 align:middle line:84%
and witnessing this is
that he was carrying

00:40:12.540 --> 00:40:15.080 align:middle line:84%
within him a cassette
recorder throughout all

00:40:15.080 --> 00:40:17.640 align:middle line:84%
of his investigation
that became really key,

00:40:17.640 --> 00:40:19.670 align:middle line:84%
which is why I mentioned
him earlier, right?

00:40:19.670 --> 00:40:20.170 align:middle line:90%
>>POPE: Yes.

00:40:20.170 --> 00:40:22.935 align:middle line:84%
He's like the Dale
Cooper of this incident.

00:40:22.935 --> 00:40:25.150 align:middle line:84%
I don't know if you
remember "Twin Peaks,"

00:40:25.150 --> 00:40:28.840 align:middle line:84%
but Special Agent Cooper
always carried with him

00:40:28.840 --> 00:40:31.250 align:middle line:90%
this hand-held Dictaphone.

00:40:31.250 --> 00:40:33.930 align:middle line:90%
And Halt was exactly the same.

00:40:33.930 --> 00:40:36.860 align:middle line:84%
He carried this thing pretty
much everywhere he went.

00:40:36.860 --> 00:40:41.420 align:middle line:84%
And any observations,
any thoughts,

00:40:41.420 --> 00:40:44.870 align:middle line:84%
he would record them so that
he would have a record of it

00:40:44.870 --> 00:40:45.530 align:middle line:90%
later.

00:40:45.530 --> 00:40:49.250 align:middle line:84%
And incredibly,
that audio record

00:40:49.250 --> 00:40:52.960 align:middle line:84%
of Halt going out into
the forest with his team

00:40:52.960 --> 00:40:53.820 align:middle line:90%
has survived.

00:40:53.820 --> 00:40:54.707 align:middle line:90%
And we have it.

00:40:54.707 --> 00:40:55.290 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:40:55.290 --> 00:40:55.790 align:middle line:90%
I know.

00:40:55.790 --> 00:40:58.040 align:middle line:84%
I just-- I was so
thrilled to learn that.

00:40:58.040 --> 00:41:01.370 align:middle line:84%
OK, now let's-- we're going to
shift just a little bit before

00:41:01.370 --> 00:41:04.870 align:middle line:84%
we continue the story in terms
of, what is the Suffolk area

00:41:04.870 --> 00:41:05.540 align:middle line:90%
about?

00:41:05.540 --> 00:41:08.620 align:middle line:84%
There were rumors that
there were nuclear warheads

00:41:08.620 --> 00:41:12.190 align:middle line:84%
in this area which
weren't supposed to be.

00:41:12.190 --> 00:41:13.780 align:middle line:90%
Let's talk about what was there.

00:41:13.780 --> 00:41:16.330 align:middle line:84%
Why might it been
that this area was

00:41:16.330 --> 00:41:21.016 align:middle line:84%
chosen on those three nights
to have this contact of sorts?

00:41:21.016 --> 00:41:23.900 align:middle line:84%
>>POPE: Well, this
area of England,

00:41:23.900 --> 00:41:29.120 align:middle line:84%
this part of Suffolk dating
back almost to the dawn of time

00:41:29.120 --> 00:41:34.100 align:middle line:84%
has been associated with all
sorts of strange occurrences.

00:41:34.100 --> 00:41:39.620 align:middle line:84%
And it now survives in terms
of legend and folklore.

00:41:39.620 --> 00:41:45.950 align:middle line:84%
Everything from
witchcraft to black dogs.

00:41:45.950 --> 00:41:49.710 align:middle line:84%
More recently and
better documented,

00:41:49.710 --> 00:41:51.840 align:middle line:84%
this is an area
which has been used

00:41:51.840 --> 00:41:55.220 align:middle line:84%
for secret military and
scientific research.

00:41:55.220 --> 00:41:59.120 align:middle line:84%
It was the part of the country
where, for example, radar

00:41:59.120 --> 00:42:02.850 align:middle line:84%
technology was first developed,
something which of course had

00:42:02.850 --> 00:42:06.840 align:middle line:84%
a pivotal effect on the outcome
of the Second World War.

00:42:06.840 --> 00:42:09.370 align:middle line:84%
So arguably, one
of those turning

00:42:09.370 --> 00:42:12.150 align:middle line:90%
points in human history.

00:42:12.150 --> 00:42:15.950 align:middle line:84%
Also, it's an area associated
with the embryonic British

00:42:15.950 --> 00:42:23.110 align:middle line:84%
nuclear research program,
with over the horizon radar

00:42:23.110 --> 00:42:27.390 align:middle line:84%
tests, something called Cobra
Mist, which has sometimes

00:42:27.390 --> 00:42:30.940 align:middle line:84%
been described as
a British HAARP.

00:42:30.940 --> 00:42:35.340 align:middle line:90%
A lot of controversy about that.

00:42:35.340 --> 00:42:39.560 align:middle line:84%
As to the question of
nuclear weapons at Bentwaters

00:42:39.560 --> 00:42:44.600 align:middle line:84%
and Woodbridge, I am still bound
by the Official Secrets Act.

00:42:44.600 --> 00:42:48.950 align:middle line:84%
And although I left
the British government

00:42:48.950 --> 00:42:52.890 align:middle line:84%
some years ago after 21 years
in the Ministry of Defense,

00:42:52.890 --> 00:42:57.140 align:middle line:84%
I can still neither confirm
nor deny the presence

00:42:57.140 --> 00:43:00.370 align:middle line:84%
of nuclear weapons
at this location

00:43:00.370 --> 00:43:02.320 align:middle line:90%
at that particular time.

00:43:02.320 --> 00:43:05.840 align:middle line:84%
But there is a lot of material
out there on the internet.

00:43:05.840 --> 00:43:11.005 align:middle line:84%
And if it helps you and
if it helps viewers--

00:43:11.005 --> 00:43:12.380 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: They
can search for it.

00:43:12.380 --> 00:43:14.300 align:middle line:84%
Because the evidence
was that it was

00:43:14.300 --> 00:43:16.630 align:middle line:84%
violating certain
treaties of the day.

00:43:16.630 --> 00:43:18.530 align:middle line:84%
>>POPE: Again, I
can't go into that.

00:43:18.530 --> 00:43:19.480 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Potentially.

00:43:19.480 --> 00:43:22.620 align:middle line:84%
>>POPE: Well, to give you one
anecdote, the people guarding

00:43:22.620 --> 00:43:25.610 align:middle line:84%
a specific area of
the base where there

00:43:25.610 --> 00:43:29.082 align:middle line:84%
was particularly high
security nicknamed it Hot Row.

00:43:29.082 --> 00:43:31.290 align:middle line:84%
So again, I think you can
draw your own conclusions--

00:43:31.290 --> 00:43:32.210 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Yes, draw
our own conclusions.

00:43:32.210 --> 00:43:33.001 align:middle line:90%
>>POPE: --for that.

00:43:33.001 --> 00:43:35.240 align:middle line:90%
But I can't, with regret.

00:43:35.240 --> 00:43:38.150 align:middle line:84%
And I checked this recently
with the Ministry of Defense

00:43:38.150 --> 00:43:39.300 align:middle line:90%
press office.

00:43:39.300 --> 00:43:40.670 align:middle line:90%
I said, look, come on.

00:43:40.670 --> 00:43:43.350 align:middle line:84%
Isn't this all a bit of
Cold War history now?

00:43:43.350 --> 00:43:44.400 align:middle line:90%
And they said, no.

00:43:44.400 --> 00:43:49.330 align:middle line:84%
You must stick to the line
that you can neither confirm

00:43:49.330 --> 00:43:52.090 align:middle line:84%
nor deny the presence
of nuclear weapons

00:43:52.090 --> 00:43:54.619 align:middle line:84%
at any given location
at any particular time.

00:43:54.619 --> 00:43:55.160 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: OK.

00:43:55.160 --> 00:43:57.084 align:middle line:84%
>>POPE: That's been
a longstanding policy

00:43:57.084 --> 00:43:59.500 align:middle line:84%
of, in fact, both the British
and the American government.

00:43:59.500 --> 00:44:00.460 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Absolutely.

00:44:00.460 --> 00:44:03.000 align:middle line:84%
Now let's talk about
the convenient use

00:44:03.000 --> 00:44:06.820 align:middle line:84%
of the word or the term
neither confirm nor deny.

00:44:06.820 --> 00:44:11.710 align:middle line:84%
Because this has a lot more
punch than people understand.

00:44:11.710 --> 00:44:12.430 align:middle line:90%
>>POPE: Yes.

00:44:12.430 --> 00:44:14.790 align:middle line:84%
On the one hand,
you could almost

00:44:14.790 --> 00:44:17.540 align:middle line:84%
regard it as a sort of
glorified no comment.

00:44:17.540 --> 00:44:20.170 align:middle line:84%
But it does go much
further than that.

00:44:20.170 --> 00:44:24.060 align:middle line:84%
What it means is that even
if we have testimony as we

00:44:24.060 --> 00:44:29.360 align:middle line:84%
do from somebody like Lord
Hill Norton, a former chief

00:44:29.360 --> 00:44:31.690 align:middle line:84%
of the defense staff
in the United Kingdom--

00:44:31.690 --> 00:44:35.740 align:middle line:90%
so a five star military officer.

00:44:35.740 --> 00:44:37.710 align:middle line:84%
Really, the American
equivalent would

00:44:37.710 --> 00:44:40.260 align:middle line:90%
be Chairman of the Joint Chiefs.

00:44:40.260 --> 00:44:44.680 align:middle line:84%
He, when after his
retirement, went on the record

00:44:44.680 --> 00:44:47.500 align:middle line:84%
and said, yes, there
were nuclear weapons

00:44:47.500 --> 00:44:51.160 align:middle line:84%
at the twin bases of
Bentwaters Woodbridge.

00:44:51.160 --> 00:44:55.350 align:middle line:84%
But even testimony
like that does not

00:44:55.350 --> 00:44:59.910 align:middle line:84%
get the government to
say, oh, all right, then.

00:44:59.910 --> 00:45:05.030 align:middle line:84%
Neither confirm nor deny,
NCND, is still the line.

00:45:05.030 --> 00:45:08.310 align:middle line:84%
And it crops up in
relation to submarines

00:45:08.310 --> 00:45:10.150 align:middle line:90%
visiting foreign bases.

00:45:10.150 --> 00:45:12.930 align:middle line:84%
It crops up in relation
to nuclear weapons.

00:45:12.930 --> 00:45:16.930 align:middle line:84%
It crops up in relation
to US UK treaties.

00:45:16.930 --> 00:45:19.920 align:middle line:84%
It really does lay
at the heart of maybe

00:45:19.920 --> 00:45:23.260 align:middle line:84%
the whole diplomatic
relationship

00:45:23.260 --> 00:45:28.200 align:middle line:84%
between the US and the UK, a
relationship which, by the way,

00:45:28.200 --> 00:45:31.750 align:middle line:84%
was strained almost to breaking
point over the Rendlesham

00:45:31.750 --> 00:45:36.400 align:middle line:84%
Forest incident, as we will
perhaps get on to discuss.

00:45:36.400 --> 00:45:37.350 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:45:37.350 --> 00:45:40.810 align:middle line:84%
We'll talk about that
in our next conversation

00:45:40.810 --> 00:45:43.680 align:middle line:90%
about how cover-ups occur.

00:45:43.680 --> 00:45:47.010 align:middle line:84%
Meanwhile, Halt
himself said that he

00:45:47.010 --> 00:45:52.030 align:middle line:84%
felt there was collusion
between the American and British

00:45:52.030 --> 00:45:54.860 align:middle line:84%
governments to
cover up this event.

00:45:54.860 --> 00:45:55.360 align:middle line:90%
>>POPE: Yes.

00:45:55.360 --> 00:45:59.410 align:middle line:84%
Halt has made it
very clear, and he's

00:45:59.410 --> 00:46:01.540 align:middle line:90%
particularly outspoken on this.

00:46:01.540 --> 00:46:07.565 align:middle line:84%
He says-- he says sometimes,
well, people say, oh,

00:46:07.565 --> 00:46:12.430 align:middle line:84%
isn't there-- who would
cover up something like this?

00:46:12.430 --> 00:46:15.370 align:middle line:84%
It would take some sort
of super secret agency.

00:46:15.370 --> 00:46:17.180 align:middle line:84%
And he says, folks,
let me tell you.

00:46:17.180 --> 00:46:19.770 align:middle line:84%
There is such a
super secret agency.

00:46:19.770 --> 00:46:23.850 align:middle line:84%
And covering it up is
exactly what they did.

00:46:23.850 --> 00:46:28.750 align:middle line:84%
And of course, Halt didn't
just document John and Jim's

00:46:28.750 --> 00:46:31.480 align:middle line:84%
sighting in relation
to the burnt trees

00:46:31.480 --> 00:46:32.840 align:middle line:90%
and the radioactivity.

00:46:32.840 --> 00:46:35.830 align:middle line:84%
He then, as you can go
on to hear on the tape,

00:46:35.830 --> 00:46:38.931 align:middle line:90%
did encounter the UFO himself.

00:46:38.931 --> 00:46:40.680 align:middle line:84%
And again, one of the
most dramatic things

00:46:40.680 --> 00:46:43.220 align:middle line:84%
on the audio tape is
where somebody calls it

00:46:43.220 --> 00:46:46.200 align:middle line:84%
to his attention and says,
sir, through the trees.

00:46:46.200 --> 00:46:47.900 align:middle line:90%
It's coming this way.

00:46:47.900 --> 00:46:49.620 align:middle line:84%
And you hear, it's
coming this way.

00:46:49.620 --> 00:46:51.260 align:middle line:90%
It's definitely coming this way.

00:46:51.260 --> 00:46:55.550 align:middle line:84%
And at one point, this
UFO is directly overhead

00:46:55.550 --> 00:47:00.000 align:middle line:84%
and fires a narrow beam of
light down at the ground

00:47:00.000 --> 00:47:02.950 align:middle line:84%
just feet in front
of him and his men.

00:47:02.950 --> 00:47:07.380 align:middle line:84%
And he said in later years
looking back at this,

00:47:07.380 --> 00:47:08.870 align:middle line:90%
was this a weapon?

00:47:08.870 --> 00:47:10.520 align:middle line:90%
Was this communication?

00:47:10.520 --> 00:47:12.700 align:middle line:90%
Was this a warning?

00:47:12.700 --> 00:47:14.270 align:middle line:90%
What was this?

00:47:14.270 --> 00:47:19.130 align:middle line:84%
And later on, right at the
end of his encounter, which

00:47:19.130 --> 00:47:23.580 align:middle line:84%
although the tape is
about 17 or 18 minutes,

00:47:23.580 --> 00:47:26.690 align:middle line:84%
it's edited down from
about two or three hours.

00:47:26.690 --> 00:47:28.990 align:middle line:84%
He wasn't recording
for the whole time.

00:47:28.990 --> 00:47:31.365 align:middle line:84%
And there's controversy about
whether those other parts--

00:47:31.365 --> 00:47:32.323 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Missing tape.

00:47:32.323 --> 00:47:33.841 align:middle line:90%
Yeah, missing time on the tape.

00:47:33.841 --> 00:47:34.340 align:middle line:90%
>>POPE: Yes.

00:47:34.340 --> 00:47:35.673 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Vis-a-vis Nixon, yeah.

00:47:35.673 --> 00:47:38.070 align:middle line:84%
>>POPE: But the last
thing you hear on the tape

00:47:38.070 --> 00:47:43.340 align:middle line:84%
is Colonel Halt out in
the forest looking back.

00:47:43.340 --> 00:47:47.050 align:middle line:84%
And he reports the
UFO hovering directly

00:47:47.050 --> 00:47:51.280 align:middle line:84%
over the Woodbridge base,
firing beams of light

00:47:51.280 --> 00:47:52.410 align:middle line:90%
down at the ground.

00:47:52.410 --> 00:47:57.210 align:middle line:84%
And some witnesses on the
ground have said in later years

00:47:57.210 --> 00:48:03.600 align:middle line:84%
that the light beams struck
a particularly sensitive part

00:48:03.600 --> 00:48:07.280 align:middle line:90%
of this military establishment.

00:48:07.280 --> 00:48:07.890 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:48:07.890 --> 00:48:11.800 align:middle line:84%
And you were on television last
night, as a matter of fact,

00:48:11.800 --> 00:48:14.980 align:middle line:84%
on the Science Channel--
"Unexplained Files."

00:48:14.980 --> 00:48:17.410 align:middle line:84%
And you were actually doing
what I'm doing right now.

00:48:17.410 --> 00:48:21.950 align:middle line:84%
You, because of your position
and your security oaths,

00:48:21.950 --> 00:48:24.380 align:middle line:84%
you were placed in the position
of the journalist asking

00:48:24.380 --> 00:48:27.030 align:middle line:84%
the questions, which puts you
in a little safer position

00:48:27.030 --> 00:48:29.020 align:middle line:90%
but in a place of knowledge.

00:48:29.020 --> 00:48:33.370 align:middle line:84%
And you talked
about, specifically,

00:48:33.370 --> 00:48:37.050 align:middle line:84%
the relationship between
UFOs and nuclear facilities

00:48:37.050 --> 00:48:39.330 align:middle line:90%
not just there, but in general.

00:48:39.330 --> 00:48:42.440 align:middle line:84%
And I recently interviewed
Robert Salas over this.

00:48:42.440 --> 00:48:46.360 align:middle line:84%
And so we're going to talk about
that a little more in part two.

00:48:46.360 --> 00:48:48.140 align:middle line:84%
But I have a couple
little questions

00:48:48.140 --> 00:48:51.180 align:middle line:90%
to ask just before we tie up.

00:48:51.180 --> 00:48:54.140 align:middle line:84%
After your time in the-- during
your time in the military

00:48:54.140 --> 00:48:57.430 align:middle line:84%
and after, how did
you end up feeling

00:48:57.430 --> 00:49:01.610 align:middle line:84%
as a citizen about the
process of disinformation

00:49:01.610 --> 00:49:03.357 align:middle line:90%
and how it occurs?

00:49:03.357 --> 00:49:04.940 align:middle line:84%
>>POPE: Well, I
should clarify and say

00:49:04.940 --> 00:49:07.490 align:middle line:84%
that although I worked for
the Ministry of Defense

00:49:07.490 --> 00:49:10.350 align:middle line:84%
for 21 years, I was actually
a civilian employee.

00:49:10.350 --> 00:49:11.937 align:middle line:84%
So I was never in
the military myself.

00:49:11.937 --> 00:49:12.520 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:49:12.520 --> 00:49:14.295 align:middle line:84%
>>POPE: But clearly,
I worked alongside--

00:49:14.295 --> 00:49:15.753 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Thank
you for clarifying.

00:49:15.753 --> 00:49:17.820 align:middle line:84%
>>POPE: No, I worked
alongside the military,

00:49:17.820 --> 00:49:20.327 align:middle line:84%
alongside colleagues in
the intelligence community.

00:49:20.327 --> 00:49:20.910 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:49:20.910 --> 00:49:26.120 align:middle line:84%
>>POPE: And I suppose--
guilty confession time--

00:49:26.120 --> 00:49:28.080 align:middle line:84%
that with your
question in mind, I

00:49:28.080 --> 00:49:33.030 align:middle line:84%
suppose I was part of that
misidentification process.

00:49:33.030 --> 00:49:37.490 align:middle line:84%
Our policy over many
years was very clear.

00:49:37.490 --> 00:49:40.950 align:middle line:84%
We consistently told the
British parliament, the media,

00:49:40.950 --> 00:49:46.360 align:middle line:84%
and the public that the UFO
issue and specific cases

00:49:46.360 --> 00:49:48.560 align:middle line:84%
like the Rendlesham
Forest incident

00:49:48.560 --> 00:49:53.180 align:middle line:84%
were of very little
interest to the department

00:49:53.180 --> 00:49:59.270 align:middle line:84%
and were assessed as being
of no defense significance.

00:49:59.270 --> 00:50:03.200 align:middle line:84%
And yet, behind the
scenes, as is now

00:50:03.200 --> 00:50:06.140 align:middle line:84%
quite clear from the
declassification and release

00:50:06.140 --> 00:50:08.820 align:middle line:84%
of much of the British
government's UFO files,

00:50:08.820 --> 00:50:10.570 align:middle line:84%
behind the scenes, it
was very clear there

00:50:10.570 --> 00:50:15.050 align:middle line:84%
was an entirely different
story-- highly classified

00:50:15.050 --> 00:50:18.860 align:middle line:84%
intelligence studies going
on into the phenomenon,

00:50:18.860 --> 00:50:20.860 align:middle line:84%
conclusions which
were certainly,

00:50:20.860 --> 00:50:24.390 align:middle line:84%
I think, at odds with the no
defense significance sound bite

00:50:24.390 --> 00:50:25.980 align:middle line:90%
that we trotted out.

00:50:25.980 --> 00:50:28.790 align:middle line:84%
And indeed, in black
and white, in one

00:50:28.790 --> 00:50:31.790 align:middle line:84%
of declassified
documents, it actually

00:50:31.790 --> 00:50:37.220 align:middle line:84%
says the well documented
Rendlesham Forest incident

00:50:37.220 --> 00:50:41.540 align:middle line:84%
is an example, we would suggest,
of a case in which witnesses

00:50:41.540 --> 00:50:46.810 align:middle line:84%
were irradiated by what we call
a UAP-- Unidentified Aerial

00:50:46.810 --> 00:50:47.374 align:middle line:90%
Phenomena.

00:50:47.374 --> 00:50:48.040 align:middle line:90%
We didn't like--

00:50:48.040 --> 00:50:50.860 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And that includes
Burroughs and Penniston,

00:50:50.860 --> 00:50:52.280 align:middle line:90%
who have suffered.

00:50:52.280 --> 00:50:53.030 align:middle line:90%
>>POPE: They have.

00:50:53.030 --> 00:50:55.610 align:middle line:84%
They have health
issues to this day.

00:50:55.610 --> 00:51:00.190 align:middle line:84%
They are struggling to
seek appropriate diagnosis

00:51:00.190 --> 00:51:05.640 align:middle line:84%
and treatment, and to do that,
need their contemporaneous

00:51:05.640 --> 00:51:08.530 align:middle line:84%
military medical records,
which they do not

00:51:08.530 --> 00:51:09.875 align:middle line:90%
seem to be able to access.

00:51:09.875 --> 00:51:11.930 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: No surprise
there, I suppose.

00:51:11.930 --> 00:51:13.740 align:middle line:84%
Now, why did you
do this project?

00:51:13.740 --> 00:51:17.670 align:middle line:84%
Before we go on to
part two another time,

00:51:17.670 --> 00:51:20.670 align:middle line:84%
why did you decide
to write this book?

00:51:20.670 --> 00:51:24.040 align:middle line:84%
>>POPE: I felt that there
had been a lot of speculation

00:51:24.040 --> 00:51:24.840 align:middle line:90%
about this.

00:51:24.840 --> 00:51:27.500 align:middle line:84%
There had been a lot of
kind of people telling

00:51:27.500 --> 00:51:29.270 align:middle line:84%
their stories in
bits and pieces.

00:51:29.270 --> 00:51:32.780 align:middle line:84%
But this was always
outsiders looking in.

00:51:32.780 --> 00:51:36.090 align:middle line:84%
I thought, what if I could
get the two witnesses really

00:51:36.090 --> 00:51:39.940 align:middle line:84%
at the heart of this-- John
Burroughs and Jim Penniston,

00:51:39.940 --> 00:51:43.350 align:middle line:84%
who after all got
closest to this thing.

00:51:43.350 --> 00:51:45.950 align:middle line:84%
Jim touched it and
had this download.

00:51:45.950 --> 00:51:48.490 align:middle line:84%
John-- maybe the phrase
again that's being used

00:51:48.490 --> 00:51:51.230 align:middle line:90%
is went into the light.

00:51:51.230 --> 00:51:55.500 align:middle line:84%
John and Jim from the point of
view of the witnesses, myself

00:51:55.500 --> 00:51:56.920 align:middle line:84%
from the point of
view of somebody

00:51:56.920 --> 00:52:00.450 align:middle line:84%
who's worked on the UFO issue
for the British government.

00:52:00.450 --> 00:52:03.110 align:middle line:10%
So this book, "Encounter
in Rendlesham Forest,"

00:52:03.110 --> 00:52:08.260 align:middle line:10%
would be a chance to tell the
story not from the outside in,

00:52:08.260 --> 00:52:10.260 align:middle line:10%
but from the inside out.

00:52:10.260 --> 00:52:12.300 align:middle line:90%
So we flip the dynamic.

00:52:12.300 --> 00:52:16.460 align:middle line:84%
And I think that combination of
the military witnesses telling

00:52:16.460 --> 00:52:19.370 align:middle line:84%
their story for the
first time and myself

00:52:19.370 --> 00:52:23.780 align:middle line:84%
as a government UFO investigator
was a unique combination.

00:52:23.780 --> 00:52:28.060 align:middle line:84%
And as a result, which has
started a few conspiracy

00:52:28.060 --> 00:52:33.570 align:middle line:84%
theories itself, this was
the only UFO book in history

00:52:33.570 --> 00:52:37.910 align:middle line:84%
ever to have required security
clearance by both the American

00:52:37.910 --> 00:52:40.280 align:middle line:90%
and the British government.

00:52:40.280 --> 00:52:42.290 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: And you procured that.

00:52:42.290 --> 00:52:43.380 align:middle line:90%
>>POPE: Yes.

00:52:43.380 --> 00:52:44.480 align:middle line:90%
We got that.

00:52:44.480 --> 00:52:51.580 align:middle line:84%
Clearly when we speculate
about some aspects of the base

00:52:51.580 --> 00:52:53.710 align:middle line:84%
where this took
place and clearly

00:52:53.710 --> 00:52:57.390 align:middle line:84%
as we get into some
scientific and technical areas

00:52:57.390 --> 00:53:02.160 align:middle line:84%
relating to intelligence
and weaponization--

00:53:02.160 --> 00:53:04.670 align:middle line:84%
and again, perhaps we'll
get on to this in part two--

00:53:04.670 --> 00:53:06.759 align:middle line:90%
there are clear limits.

00:53:06.759 --> 00:53:08.550 align:middle line:84%
And there are some
places that we can't go.

00:53:08.550 --> 00:53:11.890 align:middle line:84%
But what I hope we've
done is put enough out

00:53:11.890 --> 00:53:15.620 align:middle line:84%
into the public domain that
we can get certain people

00:53:15.620 --> 00:53:20.170 align:middle line:84%
in Congress, in the media, who
we know are interested in this

00:53:20.170 --> 00:53:23.810 align:middle line:84%
but perhaps won't say
so publicly, to take

00:53:23.810 --> 00:53:27.820 align:middle line:84%
a serious look at both
the Rendlesham Forest

00:53:27.820 --> 00:53:31.560 align:middle line:84%
issue and indeed
the UFO phenomenon

00:53:31.560 --> 00:53:35.384 align:middle line:90%
as a wider kind of phenomenon.

00:53:35.384 --> 00:53:37.800 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Well, I have to say
you've done a beautiful job.

00:53:37.800 --> 00:53:40.070 align:middle line:84%
And I was so excited
to know of this book

00:53:40.070 --> 00:53:43.040 align:middle line:84%
and read it because there's
so many people in my own life,

00:53:43.040 --> 00:53:45.580 align:middle line:84%
personally, that--
you know, I love

00:53:45.580 --> 00:53:47.542 align:middle line:84%
to share information
with them about some

00:53:47.542 --> 00:53:49.000 align:middle line:84%
of the things I've
been exposed to.

00:53:49.000 --> 00:53:53.300 align:middle line:84%
But there's always this fringe
factor kind of perception

00:53:53.300 --> 00:53:54.000 align:middle line:90%
that's going on.

00:53:54.000 --> 00:53:55.860 align:middle line:84%
And reading this
book was really,

00:53:55.860 --> 00:53:58.590 align:middle line:84%
I think, the first book
I've read where I thought,

00:53:58.590 --> 00:54:01.250 align:middle line:84%
this is so well-documented
and put together and because

00:54:01.250 --> 00:54:03.640 align:middle line:84%
of your position and the
position of the others

00:54:03.640 --> 00:54:08.040 align:middle line:84%
that we can kind of now lay
the fringe factor part of this

00:54:08.040 --> 00:54:10.720 align:middle line:84%
to rest and start getting
on with some real dialogue

00:54:10.720 --> 00:54:13.980 align:middle line:84%
about it even for the
most die hard skeptics.

00:54:13.980 --> 00:54:14.980 align:middle line:90%
>>POPE: Well, thank you.

00:54:14.980 --> 00:54:17.760 align:middle line:10%
And that was absolutely
what we set out to do.

00:54:17.760 --> 00:54:19.690 align:middle line:10%
Every claim we make
in the book can

00:54:19.690 --> 00:54:24.130 align:middle line:10%
be validated by documents
the provenance of which

00:54:24.130 --> 00:54:25.240 align:middle line:10%
is not disputed.

00:54:25.240 --> 00:54:26.960 align:middle line:10%
We talk about radiation levels.

00:54:26.960 --> 00:54:27.650 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:54:27.650 --> 00:54:28.900 align:middle line:90%
>>POPE: We quote the document.

00:54:28.900 --> 00:54:30.520 align:middle line:90%
We produce it in the appendix.

00:54:30.520 --> 00:54:33.409 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And the recordings
exist of the original event.

00:54:33.409 --> 00:54:34.200 align:middle line:90%
>>POPE: Absolutely.

00:54:34.200 --> 00:54:34.850 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:54:34.850 --> 00:54:36.600 align:middle line:84%
Well, I want to thank
you so much on that.

00:54:36.600 --> 00:54:38.266 align:middle line:84%
And then of course,
we're going to go on

00:54:38.266 --> 00:54:40.130 align:middle line:84%
to part two which is
where some of the more

00:54:40.130 --> 00:54:42.280 align:middle line:84%
controversial
information takes place.

00:54:42.280 --> 00:54:44.160 align:middle line:84%
Thank you so much
for your time, Nick.

00:54:44.160 --> 00:54:45.124 align:middle line:90%
>>POPE: Thank you.

00:54:45.124 --> 00:54:46.790 align:middle line:10%
>>REGINA: The means
by which information

00:54:46.790 --> 00:54:48.720 align:middle line:10%
is obscured is
fascinating, beginning

00:54:48.720 --> 00:54:51.530 align:middle line:10%
with injecting witnesses with
sodium pentothal, or truth

00:54:51.530 --> 00:54:54.670 align:middle line:10%
serum, and subjecting them to
hypnosis prior to having them

00:54:54.670 --> 00:54:57.110 align:middle line:10%
sign statements prepared
by the military.

00:54:57.110 --> 00:55:00.640 align:middle line:84%
It's a fascinating story which
we will continue in part two.

00:55:00.640 --> 00:55:03.340 align:middle line:84%
Nick's book is "Encounter
at Rendlesham Forest,"

00:55:03.340 --> 00:55:05.550 align:middle line:84%
which you can purchase
at any major bookseller.

00:55:05.550 --> 00:55:09.540 align:middle line:84%
