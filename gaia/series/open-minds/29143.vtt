00:00:20.150 --> 00:00:22.150 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA MEREDITH: It's
been said by great sages

00:00:22.150 --> 00:00:24.280 align:middle line:84%
throughout the ages
that this planet has

00:00:24.280 --> 00:00:27.010 align:middle line:84%
pyramids in every corner:
buried, often still

00:00:27.010 --> 00:00:29.920 align:middle line:84%
energetically active,
waiting to be rediscovered.

00:00:29.920 --> 00:00:32.330 align:middle line:84%
We visited one such
pyramid recently in Bosnia.

00:00:32.330 --> 00:00:34.460 align:middle line:10%
And now Linda Moulton
Howe is bringing us

00:00:34.460 --> 00:00:38.110 align:middle line:10%
news of another located west
of Mount McKinley in Alaska.

00:00:38.110 --> 00:00:40.130 align:middle line:10%
They call it The Dark Pyramid.

00:00:40.130 --> 00:00:42.230 align:middle line:10%
Reports from credible
military sources

00:00:42.230 --> 00:00:46.840 align:middle line:10%
began surfacing in June of 2012
on this strange artifact, which

00:00:46.840 --> 00:00:49.560 align:middle line:10%
the government took great
steps to keep secret.

00:00:49.560 --> 00:00:52.475 align:middle line:84%
Linda, an investigative
reporter for earthfiles.com

00:00:52.475 --> 00:00:55.100 align:middle line:84%
is here today to share
what she has learned

00:00:55.100 --> 00:00:57.590 align:middle line:84%
about this truly
strange anomaly.

00:00:57.590 --> 00:01:00.166 align:middle line:84%
And the thing is, this
is really coming new.

00:01:00.166 --> 00:01:01.540 align:middle line:84%
I mean, you've
been breaking this

00:01:01.540 --> 00:01:02.850 align:middle line:90%
over the last couple of months.

00:01:02.850 --> 00:01:04.308 align:middle line:84%
And you've done
this incredible job

00:01:04.308 --> 00:01:08.240 align:middle line:84%
on Earthfiles of collating
all the different testimony

00:01:08.240 --> 00:01:11.147 align:middle line:90%
from as far back as, what, 1959?

00:01:11.147 --> 00:01:12.522 align:middle line:84%
>>LINDA MOULTON
HOWE: Well, yeah.

00:01:12.522 --> 00:01:16.390 align:middle line:10%
And the thing about it is that
it really begins with the fact

00:01:16.390 --> 00:01:20.550 align:middle line:10%
that in the first two weeks of
June, I was in southern Turkey

00:01:20.550 --> 00:01:24.880 align:middle line:10%
and traveled all the way to
Gobekli Tepe with the idea

00:01:24.880 --> 00:01:26.420 align:middle line:10%
that I wanted to
know what it was

00:01:26.420 --> 00:01:31.490 align:middle line:10%
like to be up close to
those 19-foot tall pillars

00:01:31.490 --> 00:01:35.190 align:middle line:10%
that we've only been hearing
about probably since 2010

00:01:35.190 --> 00:01:38.770 align:middle line:10%
publicly, even though
the excavation began

00:01:38.770 --> 00:01:43.730 align:middle line:10%
in 1994 with the German
archaeologist Klaus Schmidt.

00:01:43.730 --> 00:01:49.610 align:middle line:84%
And looking at the fact
that the hill is supposed

00:01:49.610 --> 00:01:57.310 align:middle line:84%
to have 30 acres of these tall
limestone pillars in rings all

00:01:57.310 --> 00:02:00.820 align:middle line:84%
over it, of which they've
only excavated 5%,

00:02:00.820 --> 00:02:05.260 align:middle line:84%
I wanted to go with Robert
Schoch, who is a geologist

00:02:05.260 --> 00:02:09.360 align:middle line:84%
and did his PhD at Yale
and has been involved

00:02:09.360 --> 00:02:13.210 align:middle line:84%
with Sphinx and Egypt
and Yonaguni studies,

00:02:13.210 --> 00:02:17.600 align:middle line:84%
and he took a group of us
in Turkey to Gobekli Tepe.

00:02:17.600 --> 00:02:21.800 align:middle line:84%
And I was there in the
morning of June 13th

00:02:21.800 --> 00:02:26.510 align:middle line:84%
with the sun on my back and very
close to these tall limestone

00:02:26.510 --> 00:02:32.000 align:middle line:84%
pillars, trying to get a
sense of what are they?

00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:35.010 align:middle line:84%
Why are there these
rings of these pillars?

00:02:35.010 --> 00:02:39.030 align:middle line:84%
And what struck me
was that I and others,

00:02:39.030 --> 00:02:41.470 align:middle line:84%
all you get is a
feeling of alienness.

00:02:41.470 --> 00:02:44.330 align:middle line:84%
You don't get a sense
of why are they there.

00:02:44.330 --> 00:02:47.260 align:middle line:84%
Robert Schoch, the
geologist, said

00:02:47.260 --> 00:02:50.120 align:middle line:84%
there's something about
the shape and the thinness

00:02:50.120 --> 00:02:54.360 align:middle line:84%
that struck him as being
something like resonance,

00:02:54.360 --> 00:02:58.400 align:middle line:84%
that they were made
like antenna to vibrate.

00:02:58.400 --> 00:03:00.650 align:middle line:84%
But whatever it
is, we all agreed

00:03:00.650 --> 00:03:03.940 align:middle line:84%
that we were in the presence
of something that is not

00:03:03.940 --> 00:03:07.570 align:middle line:84%
easily accessible
to the human mind.

00:03:07.570 --> 00:03:12.890 align:middle line:84%
And more than that, the
Klaus Schmidt Archaeology

00:03:12.890 --> 00:03:16.320 align:middle line:84%
came to the conclusion that
this was 12,000 years old

00:03:16.320 --> 00:03:18.600 align:middle line:84%
through meticulous
carbon dating.

00:03:18.600 --> 00:03:21.730 align:middle line:84%
And then through
soil studies, he's

00:03:21.730 --> 00:03:27.330 align:middle line:84%
concluded that 1,000 years after
all of these big stone rings

00:03:27.330 --> 00:03:33.510 align:middle line:84%
were set over 30 acres of hill,
that somehow it was all buried.

00:03:33.510 --> 00:03:35.160 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And this
is the common theme

00:03:35.160 --> 00:03:38.120 align:middle line:84%
now, is we're getting into this
notion of "buried" artifacts.

00:03:38.120 --> 00:03:40.161 align:middle line:84%
>>MOULTON HOWE: The very
fact that it was buried.

00:03:40.161 --> 00:03:41.970 align:middle line:84%
And when I got
back to Albuquerque

00:03:41.970 --> 00:03:45.690 align:middle line:84%
and did Earthfiles and
did Coast to Coast AM,

00:03:45.690 --> 00:03:49.030 align:middle line:84%
I am laying out everything
that we saw and experienced

00:03:49.030 --> 00:03:52.060 align:middle line:84%
in Turkey and talking
about this phenomena.

00:03:52.060 --> 00:03:57.030 align:middle line:84%
How would you bury 30 acres
of 19-foot tall pillars

00:03:57.030 --> 00:03:59.380 align:middle line:90%
all in these rings?

00:03:59.380 --> 00:04:02.360 align:middle line:84%
Did it take a long time,
and if it did, why?

00:04:02.360 --> 00:04:04.790 align:middle line:84%
If it happened in a short
period of time because

00:04:04.790 --> 00:04:06.640 align:middle line:84%
of an emergency,
who could possibly

00:04:06.640 --> 00:04:09.250 align:middle line:90%
do this 12,000 years ago?

00:04:09.250 --> 00:04:14.180 align:middle line:84%
It was very clear that we were
looking at keenly, beautifully,

00:04:14.180 --> 00:04:18.880 align:middle line:84%
elegantly, almost you would use
the word manufactured pillars,

00:04:18.880 --> 00:04:22.540 align:middle line:84%
because some of these
19-foot tall, thin

00:04:22.540 --> 00:04:24.910 align:middle line:84%
had big animals
coming out of them.

00:04:24.910 --> 00:04:26.130 align:middle line:90%
And they're not glued on.

00:04:26.130 --> 00:04:28.740 align:middle line:84%
It is as if they
were made in one

00:04:28.740 --> 00:04:31.990 align:middle line:84%
fell swoop of
somebody's concept.

00:04:31.990 --> 00:04:36.820 align:middle line:84%
So after reporting about this
and leaving that question

00:04:36.820 --> 00:04:40.230 align:middle line:84%
for Coast and Earthfiles
viewers and listeners,

00:04:40.230 --> 00:04:43.590 align:middle line:84%
here we have one of the
archaeological breakthroughs

00:04:43.590 --> 00:04:45.280 align:middle line:90%
of all centuries.

00:04:45.280 --> 00:04:50.390 align:middle line:84%
12,000 years is more than
double Mesopotamia and Sumeria.

00:04:50.390 --> 00:04:52.260 align:middle line:90%
How was it buried?

00:04:52.260 --> 00:04:55.210 align:middle line:84%
A week after I had
done the broadcast,

00:04:55.210 --> 00:04:58.840 align:middle line:84%
I had an email from a
man named Doug Mutschler.

00:04:58.840 --> 00:05:02.970 align:middle line:84%
He had served for about 13 years
in Army Counterintelligence

00:05:02.970 --> 00:05:05.580 align:middle line:90%
at Fort Richardson in Alaska.

00:05:05.580 --> 00:05:09.750 align:middle line:84%
And his email was, "I was
exposed with 39 other guys,

00:05:09.750 --> 00:05:16.640 align:middle line:84%
40 of us, in an orderly room
in November of 1994 to a TV

00:05:16.640 --> 00:05:19.850 align:middle line:84%
story"-- he thought it was
on Channel 13 broadcast

00:05:19.850 --> 00:05:25.100 align:middle line:84%
in Alaska-- about the
discovery of a huge pyramid,

00:05:25.100 --> 00:05:29.920 align:middle line:84%
perhaps four times the cubic
volume of Cheops in Egypt,

00:05:29.920 --> 00:05:33.390 align:middle line:84%
underground somewhere
west of Mount McKinley,

00:05:33.390 --> 00:05:37.740 align:middle line:84%
and that they had done
animation in this TV program.

00:05:37.740 --> 00:05:41.670 align:middle line:84%
But when he tried to find
out more information-- he

00:05:41.670 --> 00:05:44.370 align:middle line:84%
was working Army
Counterintelligence--

00:05:44.370 --> 00:05:48.460 align:middle line:84%
and went to the station,
he met nothing but walls.

00:05:48.460 --> 00:05:51.130 align:middle line:84%
No one, not even the
TV station, would even

00:05:51.130 --> 00:05:54.260 align:middle line:84%
admit that they had
broadcast anything.

00:05:54.260 --> 00:05:56.850 align:middle line:84%
And he said, if you can get
to the bottom of this, Linda,

00:05:56.850 --> 00:06:00.800 align:middle line:84%
I have been trying to
find out ever since 1994.

00:06:00.800 --> 00:06:05.730 align:middle line:84%
One of the keys to 1994
was five months before.

00:06:05.730 --> 00:06:13.210 align:middle line:84%
On May 22, 1994, China did an
underground megaton nuclear

00:06:13.210 --> 00:06:14.020 align:middle line:90%
test.

00:06:14.020 --> 00:06:16.230 align:middle line:84%
The United States
and other countries

00:06:16.230 --> 00:06:18.190 align:middle line:84%
were upset that
China had done this.

00:06:18.190 --> 00:06:22.360 align:middle line:84%
But I have learned from
other seismologists

00:06:22.360 --> 00:06:26.790 align:middle line:84%
that that test was used to look
at some of the Earth's crust.

00:06:26.790 --> 00:06:30.050 align:middle line:84%
Any large, huge energy
underground tests

00:06:30.050 --> 00:06:32.940 align:middle line:84%
can be used to
look at the crust.

00:06:32.940 --> 00:06:35.690 align:middle line:84%
Doug Mutschler's story
is that they discovered

00:06:35.690 --> 00:06:39.824 align:middle line:84%
this big pyramid because of
the China underground test.

00:06:39.824 --> 00:06:40.990 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: How did that work?

00:06:40.990 --> 00:06:42.960 align:middle line:90%
How did they discover it?

00:06:42.960 --> 00:06:47.520 align:middle line:84%
>>MOULTON HOWE: Well, if
you have seismic instruments

00:06:47.520 --> 00:06:51.800 align:middle line:84%
set up-- and let's say they
already had information in 1994

00:06:51.800 --> 00:06:54.040 align:middle line:84%
about this pyramid, which
is what I'm going to.

00:06:54.040 --> 00:06:57.590 align:middle line:84%
This is what I have learned
now since-- they would

00:06:57.590 --> 00:07:01.740 align:middle line:84%
have put the seismic monitors
specifically around this area

00:07:01.740 --> 00:07:07.750 align:middle line:84%
in Alaska west of Mount McKinley
and used the China test knowing

00:07:07.750 --> 00:07:10.020 align:middle line:84%
that they already had
something underground

00:07:10.020 --> 00:07:12.600 align:middle line:84%
that they wanted to get
a clearer picture of.

00:07:12.600 --> 00:07:14.290 align:middle line:84%
So now working
backwards in time,

00:07:14.290 --> 00:07:19.290 align:middle line:84%
I did a story at Earthfiles and
at Coast to Coast and Dreamland

00:07:19.290 --> 00:07:23.040 align:middle line:84%
about the Doug Mutschler
saying does anybody out there

00:07:23.040 --> 00:07:25.800 align:middle line:84%
have any more information
from Fort Richardson

00:07:25.800 --> 00:07:29.230 align:middle line:84%
or any military source
about this pyramid?

00:07:29.230 --> 00:07:30.980 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Let me
interject something here.

00:07:30.980 --> 00:07:33.680 align:middle line:84%
Your background-- and
you have a master's

00:07:33.680 --> 00:07:35.110 align:middle line:90%
from Stanford University.

00:07:35.110 --> 00:07:37.800 align:middle line:84%
You've been producing and
doing investigative reporting

00:07:37.800 --> 00:07:39.580 align:middle line:90%
for over three decades now.

00:07:39.580 --> 00:07:43.940 align:middle line:84%
And so the types of people
that come to Earthfiles

00:07:43.940 --> 00:07:46.265 align:middle line:84%
are everything
from dignitaries--

00:07:46.265 --> 00:07:47.390 align:middle line:90%
>>MOULTON HOWE: Scientists.

00:07:47.390 --> 00:07:49.150 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: -global
leaders, scientists

00:07:49.150 --> 00:07:53.460 align:middle line:84%
because you do extremely
meticulous research.

00:07:53.460 --> 00:07:56.410 align:middle line:84%
You're not going out
into speculation.

00:07:56.410 --> 00:07:59.070 align:middle line:84%
And I'm not saying there
isn't room for speculation.

00:07:59.070 --> 00:08:00.390 align:middle line:90%
I'm saying that's not your job.

00:08:00.390 --> 00:08:04.225 align:middle line:84%
But your job is to really
meticulously detail this.

00:08:04.225 --> 00:08:07.690 align:middle line:84%
So, when people start
writing in to you,

00:08:07.690 --> 00:08:09.230 align:middle line:84%
it's because of the
kind of presence

00:08:09.230 --> 00:08:10.480 align:middle line:90%
you've created with this site.

00:08:10.480 --> 00:08:11.563 align:middle line:90%
>>MOULTON HOWE: Thank you.

00:08:11.563 --> 00:08:14.160 align:middle line:84%
I hope so, because
I started getting

00:08:14.160 --> 00:08:17.280 align:middle line:84%
a lot of people who
were scientists saying,

00:08:17.280 --> 00:08:21.310 align:middle line:84%
I don't want my name used,
but here try this, try this.

00:08:21.310 --> 00:08:25.290 align:middle line:84%
And one of the emails that came
in after the Doug Mutschler

00:08:25.290 --> 00:08:28.780 align:middle line:84%
Earthfiles and broadcast,
was from the son of a man

00:08:28.780 --> 00:08:31.000 align:middle line:90%
that I call John Smith.

00:08:31.000 --> 00:08:38.049 align:middle line:84%
And his father had a
career that involved

00:08:38.049 --> 00:08:43.010 align:middle line:84%
working in the military and
had gone in to Western Electric

00:08:43.010 --> 00:08:44.580 align:middle line:90%
after the military.

00:08:44.580 --> 00:08:49.150 align:middle line:84%
And Western Electric
and Bell were the lab--

00:08:49.150 --> 00:08:52.690 align:middle line:84%
if there was any place on the
planet doing groundbreaking

00:08:52.690 --> 00:08:54.274 align:middle line:84%
science, it was in
the United States--

00:08:58.410 --> 00:09:01.680 align:middle line:84%
And the story, now, in
the John Smith character

00:09:01.680 --> 00:09:07.590 align:middle line:84%
is that his father got
a request to go and work

00:09:07.590 --> 00:09:12.030 align:middle line:90%
in Alaska between '59 and '61.

00:09:12.030 --> 00:09:16.290 align:middle line:84%
And now it's not
mysterious, the son

00:09:16.290 --> 00:09:21.320 align:middle line:84%
talking with his father for
decades about his assignment

00:09:21.320 --> 00:09:25.530 align:middle line:84%
says he referred to
it as a dark pyramid.

00:09:25.530 --> 00:09:29.370 align:middle line:84%
That he went in an elevator--
a mining shaft elevator

00:09:29.370 --> 00:09:34.900 align:middle line:84%
down 700 feet to the
base of a pyramid

00:09:34.900 --> 00:09:37.320 align:middle line:84%
made out of some
kind of stone that

00:09:37.320 --> 00:09:40.070 align:middle line:84%
was considered to be
somewhere around four

00:09:40.070 --> 00:09:42.230 align:middle line:90%
times the volume of Cheops.

00:09:42.230 --> 00:09:45.230 align:middle line:84%
And that the father told
the son in great detail

00:09:45.230 --> 00:09:49.720 align:middle line:84%
about how they would walk
down a cement walkway,

00:09:49.720 --> 00:09:51.880 align:middle line:84%
and that they would
enter into one

00:09:51.880 --> 00:09:55.470 align:middle line:84%
of the base vertices
of this huge pyramid.

00:09:55.470 --> 00:09:58.930 align:middle line:84%
And said that they knew
that it could give off

00:09:58.930 --> 00:10:01.230 align:middle line:90%
a tremendous amount of energy.

00:10:01.230 --> 00:10:03.580 align:middle line:84%
And not only could
it give off energy,

00:10:03.580 --> 00:10:07.110 align:middle line:84%
the father's work was
trying to understand

00:10:07.110 --> 00:10:11.540 align:middle line:84%
how this huge structure
underground could somehow

00:10:11.540 --> 00:10:15.420 align:middle line:84%
enhance energy in
an electrical form.

00:10:15.420 --> 00:10:17.270 align:middle line:90%
This was the mystery.

00:10:17.270 --> 00:10:21.870 align:middle line:84%
And that the father confirmed
that the vertex-- so here's

00:10:21.870 --> 00:10:28.590 align:middle line:84%
a pyramid-- the top was 150 feet
below ground, the base at 700.

00:10:28.590 --> 00:10:34.210 align:middle line:84%
That means this was a pyramid
550 feet vertical, bigger

00:10:34.210 --> 00:10:37.380 align:middle line:84%
than Cheops, which is what
Doug Mutschler had said

00:10:37.380 --> 00:10:41.000 align:middle line:84%
they had reported on this
strange mysterious TV program

00:10:41.000 --> 00:10:43.420 align:middle line:90%
that nobody can find.

00:10:43.420 --> 00:10:49.410 align:middle line:84%
So I put out Earthfiles
and at Coast and Dreamland

00:10:49.410 --> 00:10:52.630 align:middle line:84%
the story now of
a Western Electric

00:10:52.630 --> 00:10:54.920 align:middle line:84%
man with all of his
background papers,

00:10:54.920 --> 00:10:58.620 align:middle line:84%
even more than I have
put out publicly.

00:10:58.620 --> 00:11:02.960 align:middle line:84%
And within a week of that,
I get another email coming

00:11:02.960 --> 00:11:05.490 align:middle line:84%
from a man who said,
"I'm going to let

00:11:05.490 --> 00:11:09.060 align:middle line:84%
you use my real
name, Bruce Pearson."

00:11:09.060 --> 00:11:15.270 align:middle line:84%
And he said, "My father was
in the Navy, was on a PT boat.

00:11:15.270 --> 00:11:17.985 align:middle line:84%
My father has a typed
letter from Forrestal,

00:11:17.985 --> 00:11:20.570 align:middle line:84%
who was our first
Secretary of Defense."

00:11:20.570 --> 00:11:22.960 align:middle line:84%
He said, "Our family
has never understood

00:11:22.960 --> 00:11:26.920 align:middle line:84%
why did my dad receive
this typed letter?"

00:11:26.920 --> 00:11:29.610 align:middle line:84%
Maybe it was something that
went to a bunch of people

00:11:29.610 --> 00:11:31.390 align:middle line:90%
who had fought.

00:11:31.390 --> 00:11:35.490 align:middle line:84%
But nevertheless, it always
raised questions in the family

00:11:35.490 --> 00:11:38.270 align:middle line:84%
as the father left
military and started

00:11:38.270 --> 00:11:42.990 align:middle line:84%
doing a variety of
other kinds of work.

00:11:42.990 --> 00:11:45.260 align:middle line:84%
He-- the father said
he wanted to get away

00:11:45.260 --> 00:11:48.750 align:middle line:90%
from Washington, DC pressure.

00:11:48.750 --> 00:11:50.580 align:middle line:90%
And the son remembered that.

00:11:50.580 --> 00:11:52.580 align:middle line:90%
And where did they go?

00:11:52.580 --> 00:11:56.140 align:middle line:84%
The father and the mother
applied for a teaching job

00:11:56.140 --> 00:11:58.910 align:middle line:90%
in Unalakleet, Alaska.

00:11:58.910 --> 00:12:01.420 align:middle line:84%
It's about as far
to the west as you

00:12:01.420 --> 00:12:04.680 align:middle line:90%
can get from Mount McKinley.

00:12:04.680 --> 00:12:07.520 align:middle line:84%
And the story is
from the son talking

00:12:07.520 --> 00:12:11.200 align:middle line:84%
with the father in great
depth, that-- and the mother.

00:12:11.200 --> 00:12:14.430 align:middle line:84%
The mother is still alive and
completely confirms everything

00:12:14.430 --> 00:12:19.810 align:middle line:84%
that I've reported, and more
actually-- that the father, who

00:12:19.810 --> 00:12:25.500 align:middle line:84%
kept his hand in aviation
from his military career,

00:12:25.500 --> 00:12:30.510 align:middle line:84%
was in Unalakleet one day
and how he crossed paths

00:12:30.510 --> 00:12:34.980 align:middle line:84%
with this helicopter pilot
is still not quite clear.

00:12:34.980 --> 00:12:38.260 align:middle line:84%
But the helicopter
pilot and the dad

00:12:38.260 --> 00:12:40.510 align:middle line:90%
talk about their PT boat days.

00:12:40.510 --> 00:12:41.480 align:middle line:90%
They had both been--

00:12:41.480 --> 00:12:42.810 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: A little
camaraderie was developing.

00:12:42.810 --> 00:12:44.320 align:middle line:90%
>>MOULTON HOWE: Camaraderie.

00:12:44.320 --> 00:12:48.300 align:middle line:84%
And according to the
son, and I have this

00:12:48.300 --> 00:12:51.850 align:middle line:84%
straight from the
wife, the mother,

00:12:51.850 --> 00:12:55.850 align:middle line:84%
the father told them the
pilot said, "Hey, we're

00:12:55.850 --> 00:12:58.020 align:middle line:90%
on a classified mission."

00:12:58.020 --> 00:13:01.700 align:middle line:84%
But it was like, you've
been in our shoes.

00:13:01.700 --> 00:13:04.450 align:middle line:84%
Why don't you take a
jump run out with us.

00:13:04.450 --> 00:13:06.450 align:middle line:90%
We're going to be out two hours.

00:13:06.450 --> 00:13:09.780 align:middle line:84%
They've told us we can't
land, we can only drop off,

00:13:09.780 --> 00:13:11.440 align:middle line:90%
we've got heavy cargo.

00:13:11.440 --> 00:13:13.220 align:middle line:84%
And then we'll be
back to Unalakleet

00:13:13.220 --> 00:13:15.810 align:middle line:90%
and we'll have fun talking.

00:13:15.810 --> 00:13:19.630 align:middle line:84%
And as they approached, you
could see Mount McKinley,

00:13:19.630 --> 00:13:23.145 align:middle line:84%
which I now know exactly because
I've had a helicopter go there

00:13:23.145 --> 00:13:25.270 align:middle line:84%
and I now know what it
looks like from a helicopter

00:13:25.270 --> 00:13:27.995 align:middle line:84%
in this place that we
think is the anomaly.

00:13:27.995 --> 00:13:30.770 align:middle line:90%


00:13:30.770 --> 00:13:33.410 align:middle line:90%
They lose everything.

00:13:33.410 --> 00:13:34.740 align:middle line:90%
They lose their compass--

00:13:34.740 --> 00:13:36.300 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Magnetic
orientation, yeah.

00:13:36.300 --> 00:13:38.420 align:middle line:84%
>>MOULTON HOWE:
Everything is going crazy.

00:13:38.420 --> 00:13:43.110 align:middle line:84%
And at first, the father
riding in the backseat,

00:13:43.110 --> 00:13:44.680 align:middle line:84%
even though the
pilot had said we

00:13:44.680 --> 00:13:47.125 align:middle line:84%
may run into something choppy,
when it starts happening,

00:13:47.125 --> 00:13:48.930 align:middle line:84%
he says don't
worry, don't worry.

00:13:48.930 --> 00:13:50.430 align:middle line:90%
We've been briefed on this.

00:13:50.430 --> 00:13:53.230 align:middle line:84%
We'll be able to get
down, don't worry.

00:13:53.230 --> 00:13:59.040 align:middle line:84%
And eventually, with all of
this sort of flying blind,

00:13:59.040 --> 00:14:02.080 align:middle line:84%
they were able to
land and could see

00:14:02.080 --> 00:14:08.000 align:middle line:84%
a jeep that had a .50 caliber
machine gun aimed at them.

00:14:08.000 --> 00:14:14.540 align:middle line:84%
There were six men in
black suits, no insignias,

00:14:14.540 --> 00:14:16.220 align:middle line:90%
who came running.

00:14:16.220 --> 00:14:20.520 align:middle line:84%
Inside of the helicopter
were these two heavy cases,

00:14:20.520 --> 00:14:22.950 align:middle line:84%
and the pilot had said he had
no idea what were in them.

00:14:22.950 --> 00:14:27.360 align:middle line:84%
But they were so heavy that
when the helicopter settled just

00:14:27.360 --> 00:14:32.880 align:middle line:84%
for the men to come in,
the bases of the helicopter

00:14:32.880 --> 00:14:35.100 align:middle line:84%
went out there
was so much weight

00:14:35.100 --> 00:14:36.840 align:middle line:90%
in these two heavy boxes.

00:14:36.840 --> 00:14:42.210 align:middle line:84%
Six men pull off and
they say, "Standby."

00:14:42.210 --> 00:14:45.730 align:middle line:84%
And they had-- it was
kind of like a hose that

00:14:45.730 --> 00:14:48.760 align:middle line:84%
was in the back of this jeep
where the .50 caliber was.

00:14:48.760 --> 00:14:51.030 align:middle line:84%
They refueled and
told them they had

00:14:51.030 --> 00:14:53.600 align:middle line:90%
to keep the rotor blades going.

00:14:53.600 --> 00:14:58.150 align:middle line:84%
And so they refueled
and took off.

00:14:58.150 --> 00:15:01.965 align:middle line:84%
Now what did the father tell
the son that I've interviewed

00:15:01.965 --> 00:15:06.500 align:middle line:84%
that he learned from that
pilot about what in the world

00:15:06.500 --> 00:15:08.575 align:middle line:84%
was there under that
kind of security.

00:15:08.575 --> 00:15:11.800 align:middle line:90%


00:15:11.800 --> 00:15:18.460 align:middle line:84%
It is a pyramid made out of
stone thousands of years old,

00:15:18.460 --> 00:15:22.220 align:middle line:84%
the maker is
unknown, and that we

00:15:22.220 --> 00:15:25.430 align:middle line:84%
know-- meaning our
government, the US government

00:15:25.430 --> 00:15:28.670 align:middle line:84%
has learned-- that
it can give off

00:15:28.670 --> 00:15:34.080 align:middle line:84%
enough energy to power
the nation of Canada.

00:15:34.080 --> 00:15:39.830 align:middle line:84%
Now the father tells his
wife and the son about this

00:15:39.830 --> 00:15:43.690 align:middle line:84%
and says, "I promised the
pilot I would never ever

00:15:43.690 --> 00:15:46.510 align:middle line:90%
talk to anybody, so don't talk."

00:15:46.510 --> 00:15:48.580 align:middle line:90%
That was in 1978.

00:15:48.580 --> 00:15:54.590 align:middle line:10%
So now we have '59 to '61,
a Western Electric, Bell

00:15:54.590 --> 00:15:57.670 align:middle line:10%
with a military background,
electrical engineer, who

00:15:57.670 --> 00:16:00.900 align:middle line:10%
was working at the
base of a pyramid

00:16:00.900 --> 00:16:03.220 align:middle line:10%
and tells his son all about it.

00:16:03.220 --> 00:16:09.710 align:middle line:84%
Then you jump from '59, '61, to
1978, Unalakleet out to where?

00:16:09.710 --> 00:16:11.530 align:middle line:90%
Very near Mount McKinley.

00:16:11.530 --> 00:16:16.060 align:middle line:84%
And this drama and this
being thousands of years old?

00:16:16.060 --> 00:16:18.790 align:middle line:84%
No one knows who made
it, but the government

00:16:18.790 --> 00:16:23.920 align:middle line:84%
knows that it will give off
enough energy to power Canada?

00:16:23.920 --> 00:16:26.560 align:middle line:90%
Jump to 1994, November.

00:16:26.560 --> 00:16:30.610 align:middle line:84%
40 men working in the
United States Army

00:16:30.610 --> 00:16:33.130 align:middle line:84%
Counterintelligence--
the warrant

00:16:33.130 --> 00:16:36.120 align:middle line:84%
officer, Doug
Mutschler, watches.

00:16:36.120 --> 00:16:37.480 align:middle line:90%
It was in house.

00:16:37.480 --> 00:16:38.880 align:middle line:90%
It was in Fort Richardson.

00:16:38.880 --> 00:16:41.810 align:middle line:84%
That's what we are still
trying to figure out.

00:16:41.810 --> 00:16:44.340 align:middle line:84%
Was this something
that was not broadcast

00:16:44.340 --> 00:16:46.590 align:middle line:84%
to the greater
Anchorage population?

00:16:46.590 --> 00:16:51.490 align:middle line:84%
Was this a test for some reason
inside of Fort Richardson,

00:16:51.490 --> 00:16:54.275 align:middle line:84%
and it tells about this
huge pyramid underground

00:16:54.275 --> 00:16:57.840 align:middle line:84%
and how scientists found it
with the Chinese 1 megaton

00:16:57.840 --> 00:17:01.720 align:middle line:84%
test, which is how I
came to learn about it?

00:17:01.720 --> 00:17:06.710 align:middle line:84%
And since I have
done that interview

00:17:06.710 --> 00:17:09.550 align:middle line:84%
and have been unfolding
this story, what

00:17:09.550 --> 00:17:13.020 align:middle line:84%
is beginning to
come forward to me

00:17:13.020 --> 00:17:17.109 align:middle line:84%
are other stories that I
still do not have hard fact

00:17:17.109 --> 00:17:20.900 align:middle line:84%
but are suggesting that
all over the planet

00:17:20.900 --> 00:17:23.180 align:middle line:84%
that there are pyramid
structures that,

00:17:23.180 --> 00:17:28.140 align:middle line:84%
once upon a time, as the
pilot of that helicopter

00:17:28.140 --> 00:17:35.640 align:middle line:84%
told Bruce Pearson's father,
thousands of years old.

00:17:35.640 --> 00:17:39.730 align:middle line:84%
Well, Gobekli Tepe
is 12,000 years old.

00:17:39.730 --> 00:17:44.230 align:middle line:84%
And Gobekli Tepe has an alien
quality to it that you cannot

00:17:44.230 --> 00:17:49.540 align:middle line:84%
imagine hunter-gatherers taking
blades and making Gobekli Tepe.

00:17:49.540 --> 00:17:51.942 align:middle line:84%
So who was on this
planet terraforming--

00:17:51.942 --> 00:17:53.400 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: I mean,
they're in China.

00:17:53.400 --> 00:17:54.816 align:middle line:84%
>>MOULTON HOWE:
-12,000 years ago.

00:17:54.816 --> 00:17:57.210 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Central America,
South America, Mexico.

00:17:57.210 --> 00:17:58.570 align:middle line:90%
They're everywhere.

00:17:58.570 --> 00:18:03.370 align:middle line:84%
>>MOULTON HOWE: And if
what that pilot said

00:18:03.370 --> 00:18:07.320 align:middle line:84%
is true, that our government
knows that they can give off

00:18:07.320 --> 00:18:12.010 align:middle line:84%
enough energy to power
Canada, what in the world must

00:18:12.010 --> 00:18:14.470 align:middle line:84%
this planet have
looked like, whether it

00:18:14.470 --> 00:18:18.760 align:middle line:84%
was 12,000, 20,000,
50,000 years ago?

00:18:18.760 --> 00:18:20.620 align:middle line:84%
We're talking about
something that

00:18:20.620 --> 00:18:24.970 align:middle line:84%
might have been a
Nikolai Tesla dream.

00:18:24.970 --> 00:18:30.740 align:middle line:84%
Pyramids around this whole
25,000-mile circumference

00:18:30.740 --> 00:18:38.155 align:middle line:84%
planet that would have
provided wireless free energy.

00:18:38.155 --> 00:18:39.030 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Absolutely.

00:18:39.030 --> 00:18:41.470 align:middle line:84%
And you and I both know of
Christopher Dunn's work.

00:18:41.470 --> 00:18:43.345 align:middle line:84%
We have an interview,
if you haven't seen it,

00:18:43.345 --> 00:18:46.170 align:middle line:84%
in our archives of Christopher
Dunn's work and the Giza power

00:18:46.170 --> 00:18:47.240 align:middle line:90%
plant.

00:18:47.240 --> 00:18:51.330 align:middle line:84%
And what's interesting
is at this time,

00:18:51.330 --> 00:18:54.680 align:middle line:84%
certain technologies of
almost an esoteric nature--

00:18:54.680 --> 00:18:57.240 align:middle line:84%
because we're really out
there in the quantum field now

00:18:57.240 --> 00:18:58.860 align:middle line:84%
in terms of
technologies interfacing

00:18:58.860 --> 00:19:00.670 align:middle line:84%
with consciousness--
are starting

00:19:00.670 --> 00:19:04.540 align:middle line:84%
to have the capability of
locating a lot of what's

00:19:04.540 --> 00:19:08.090 align:middle line:84%
underground in a way that hasn't
been possible until this time.

00:19:08.090 --> 00:19:09.569 align:middle line:90%
And I know of one such source.

00:19:09.569 --> 00:19:11.110 align:middle line:84%
And just because
it's esoteric, we'll

00:19:11.110 --> 00:19:13.105 align:middle line:84%
just put it out there as
hearsay at this point.

00:19:13.105 --> 00:19:14.730 align:middle line:84%
But nonetheless,
they're saying they've

00:19:14.730 --> 00:19:17.890 align:middle line:84%
discovered lots of
different pyramids

00:19:17.890 --> 00:19:20.510 align:middle line:84%
and there are various minerals
and such that are always

00:19:20.510 --> 00:19:22.460 align:middle line:84%
combined with these
pyramids nearby.

00:19:22.460 --> 00:19:24.210 align:middle line:84%
>>MOULTON HOWE: And
it's not even hearsay.

00:19:24.210 --> 00:19:27.650 align:middle line:84%
We're talking about just in
the past 12 months or so,

00:19:27.650 --> 00:19:31.800 align:middle line:84%
that there was a deep
ground-penetrating radar

00:19:31.800 --> 00:19:34.190 align:middle line:90%
study of Cairo.

00:19:34.190 --> 00:19:36.050 align:middle line:84%
And they have found
as many, I believe,

00:19:36.050 --> 00:19:40.530 align:middle line:84%
it's 19 buried pyramids
that no one knew about.

00:19:40.530 --> 00:19:41.790 align:middle line:90%
It's like Gobekli.

00:19:41.790 --> 00:19:42.870 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:19:42.870 --> 00:19:46.790 align:middle line:84%
>>MOULTON HOWE: Klaus
Schmidt started in 1994

00:19:46.790 --> 00:19:49.140 align:middle line:84%
and made his first
public statements

00:19:49.140 --> 00:19:52.910 align:middle line:90%
about Gobekli Tepe in 2010.

00:19:52.910 --> 00:19:56.450 align:middle line:84%
And all he has been able
to uncover is about 5%

00:19:56.450 --> 00:19:58.130 align:middle line:90%
of that hill.

00:19:58.130 --> 00:20:01.490 align:middle line:84%
When they did the
ground-penetrating radar,

00:20:01.490 --> 00:20:05.370 align:middle line:84%
and they said, my god,
there may be 200 or 300 more

00:20:05.370 --> 00:20:11.370 align:middle line:84%
of these tall pillars
in these rings.

00:20:11.370 --> 00:20:14.340 align:middle line:84%
We are now at a time
where it isn't just

00:20:14.340 --> 00:20:21.660 align:middle line:84%
Gobekli Tepe and Cairo and
buried pyramids or pillars.

00:20:21.660 --> 00:20:24.130 align:middle line:84%
I think one of the most
fascinating stories that I have

00:20:24.130 --> 00:20:28.290 align:middle line:84%
done in the last-- let's say
between 2010 and 2012 alone,

00:20:28.290 --> 00:20:33.070 align:middle line:84%
and no one knew about
this until just recently--

00:20:33.070 --> 00:20:37.040 align:middle line:84%
an Australian archaeologist
decided that he would try

00:20:37.040 --> 00:20:41.610 align:middle line:84%
to see into politically
difficult areas of the world

00:20:41.610 --> 00:20:48.200 align:middle line:84%
like Syria, Iran, Iraq, and what
they have found are more than

00:20:48.200 --> 00:20:53.200 align:middle line:84%
2,000--- try to grasp
this-- 2,000 stone rings.

00:20:53.200 --> 00:20:55.750 align:middle line:84%
Many of them are as
big as football fields,

00:20:55.750 --> 00:20:57.810 align:middle line:90%
300 feet in diameter.

00:20:57.810 --> 00:21:00.480 align:middle line:84%
And they spread
from southern Syria

00:21:00.480 --> 00:21:04.700 align:middle line:84%
into Jordan and
into Saudi Arabia.

00:21:04.700 --> 00:21:09.810 align:middle line:84%
No one, including the
Bedouin, knew they were there.

00:21:09.810 --> 00:21:13.280 align:middle line:84%
You cannot stand on the
ground-- just like at Nazca--

00:21:13.280 --> 00:21:17.070 align:middle line:84%
you can't stand on the
ground and see anything.

00:21:17.070 --> 00:21:20.690 align:middle line:84%
And yet, when they
went to satellites

00:21:20.690 --> 00:21:23.590 align:middle line:84%
for the brand new technology
of beginning to look,

00:21:23.590 --> 00:21:26.250 align:middle line:84%
just like Google is
mapping the world,

00:21:26.250 --> 00:21:29.620 align:middle line:84%
this is where these
thousands of rings showed up.

00:21:29.620 --> 00:21:32.980 align:middle line:90%
But they aren't just rings.

00:21:32.980 --> 00:21:36.820 align:middle line:84%
I have photographs that I got
from the Australian scientist,

00:21:36.820 --> 00:21:39.610 align:middle line:84%
and it looks like you're
looking at bacteria.

00:21:39.610 --> 00:21:42.580 align:middle line:84%
It looks like you're
looking at organic forms.

00:21:42.580 --> 00:21:45.945 align:middle line:84%
They either have facets
or divisions to them.

00:21:45.945 --> 00:21:51.820 align:middle line:84%
The big circles can have smaller
circles and weird patterns.

00:21:51.820 --> 00:21:53.110 align:middle line:90%
Why?

00:21:53.110 --> 00:21:55.850 align:middle line:84%
And what is the
oldest date so far?

00:21:55.850 --> 00:21:59.510 align:middle line:90%
9,000 to 10,000 years old.

00:21:59.510 --> 00:22:04.020 align:middle line:84%
Now we're getting up
into Gobekli territory.

00:22:04.020 --> 00:22:08.470 align:middle line:84%
Who was putting thousands
of rings in lava--

00:22:08.470 --> 00:22:11.800 align:middle line:84%
it's a whole big
20-million-year-old lava

00:22:11.800 --> 00:22:16.270 align:middle line:84%
spread, that that's what makes
them so visible from the sky,

00:22:16.270 --> 00:22:19.360 align:middle line:84%
and that that lava covers these
three nations and that's how

00:22:19.360 --> 00:22:20.710 align:middle line:90%
they could see them.

00:22:20.710 --> 00:22:24.460 align:middle line:84%
Well, but who 9,000
to 10,000 years ago

00:22:24.460 --> 00:22:27.240 align:middle line:84%
would've had the
ability to make all

00:22:27.240 --> 00:22:34.530 align:middle line:84%
of these very complex, bizarre
300-foot diameter rings that

00:22:34.530 --> 00:22:38.667 align:middle line:90%
can only be seen from the sky?

00:22:38.667 --> 00:22:40.500 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Well, and
what's fascinating to me

00:22:40.500 --> 00:22:42.760 align:middle line:84%
as you're talking about
it, what it's drawing up

00:22:42.760 --> 00:22:45.200 align:middle line:84%
is the imagery in also
Michael Tellinger's work

00:22:45.200 --> 00:22:49.740 align:middle line:84%
of all these artifacts covering
thousands and thousands

00:22:49.740 --> 00:22:51.690 align:middle line:90%
of kilometers in South Africa.

00:22:51.690 --> 00:22:53.350 align:middle line:84%
>>MOULTON HOWE: And
do you know what?

00:22:53.350 --> 00:22:55.480 align:middle line:84%
I began to think
when I started going

00:22:55.480 --> 00:22:59.860 align:middle line:84%
into crop circles for the
first time in 1992 in England,

00:22:59.860 --> 00:23:01.550 align:middle line:84%
some of us got
into discussions--

00:23:01.550 --> 00:23:04.360 align:middle line:84%
and I wrote about this in my
fourth book, "Mysterious Lights

00:23:04.360 --> 00:23:07.260 align:middle line:84%
and Crop Circles--"
the possibility

00:23:07.260 --> 00:23:15.840 align:middle line:84%
that rings and circles of
stone, ziggurats, pyramids

00:23:15.840 --> 00:23:18.660 align:middle line:84%
all played as some
sort of a technology

00:23:18.660 --> 00:23:21.990 align:middle line:84%
by advanced intelligences
that were not Cro-Magnon,

00:23:21.990 --> 00:23:23.940 align:middle line:90%
Homo sapien, Sapien.

00:23:23.940 --> 00:23:28.700 align:middle line:84%
And then you jump to the
1970s and to the 1980s

00:23:28.700 --> 00:23:34.440 align:middle line:84%
and to the 1990s and now as
we go into the 21st century,

00:23:34.440 --> 00:23:38.530 align:middle line:84%
crop formations have been
all over this planet as well.

00:23:38.530 --> 00:23:43.260 align:middle line:84%
But we consider it to be
a modern day phenomenon.

00:23:43.260 --> 00:23:47.120 align:middle line:84%
And in 1993, my second
year in England,

00:23:47.120 --> 00:23:49.350 align:middle line:84%
I met a man in a
crop formation and we

00:23:49.350 --> 00:23:52.775 align:middle line:84%
had the strangest
conversation at the time.

00:23:52.775 --> 00:23:55.160 align:middle line:84%
And I was brand new
like everybody else

00:23:55.160 --> 00:23:57.370 align:middle line:84%
to crop formations, but
it ties into everything

00:23:57.370 --> 00:24:00.240 align:middle line:90%
we've talked about.

00:24:00.240 --> 00:24:03.660 align:middle line:84%
He said that he had a friend
working for the Central

00:24:03.660 --> 00:24:06.430 align:middle line:84%
Intelligence Agency
whose job was

00:24:06.430 --> 00:24:11.250 align:middle line:84%
to study crop formations from
satellites because they had

00:24:11.250 --> 00:24:14.170 align:middle line:84%
big Cray computers that
were trying by latitude

00:24:14.170 --> 00:24:20.180 align:middle line:84%
and longitude and chronology to
put every crop formation that

00:24:20.180 --> 00:24:23.490 align:middle line:84%
appeared on the
planet on a timeline,

00:24:23.490 --> 00:24:29.200 align:middle line:84%
because the CIA was looking for
embedded mathematical language.

00:24:29.200 --> 00:24:33.440 align:middle line:84%
And he said my friend
told me that they

00:24:33.440 --> 00:24:37.040 align:middle line:84%
have come to the conclusion that
the crop formations are being

00:24:37.040 --> 00:24:42.490 align:middle line:84%
made by time travelers, who
are using the skin of the Earth

00:24:42.490 --> 00:24:46.710 align:middle line:84%
to judge how accurate they
are in terms of the position

00:24:46.710 --> 00:24:51.550 align:middle line:84%
that they are
coming back in time.

00:24:51.550 --> 00:24:58.740 align:middle line:84%
How complex is the history
of this planet in waves.

00:24:58.740 --> 00:25:02.060 align:middle line:84%
And I think you laugh
because we could go back

00:25:02.060 --> 00:25:05.400 align:middle line:84%
270 million years
ago, and there may

00:25:05.400 --> 00:25:08.950 align:middle line:84%
have been all kinds of
geopolitical territorial

00:25:08.950 --> 00:25:12.060 align:middle line:84%
structures on this
planet, so far

00:25:12.060 --> 00:25:13.804 align:middle line:90%
preceding standing up primates.

00:25:13.804 --> 00:25:14.470 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:25:14.470 --> 00:25:17.526 align:middle line:10%
>>MOULTON HOWE: And how
ironic that in 2012,

00:25:17.526 --> 00:25:21.490 align:middle line:10%
in the 21st century,
our biggest truths

00:25:21.490 --> 00:25:24.730 align:middle line:10%
are beginning to come to
us through the ground,

00:25:24.730 --> 00:25:26.630 align:middle line:10%
through the things
that have been buried.

00:25:26.630 --> 00:25:30.410 align:middle line:10%
And that suddenly the whole
idea that Cheops in Egypt

00:25:30.410 --> 00:25:34.370 align:middle line:10%
was something grand and
unique-- it is grand and unique,

00:25:34.370 --> 00:25:37.350 align:middle line:10%
but it is not the only
grand and unique pyramid.

00:25:37.350 --> 00:25:40.040 align:middle line:10%
And that it may be
that eventually we

00:25:40.040 --> 00:25:43.935 align:middle line:10%
are going to find that
there are buried pyramids--

00:25:43.935 --> 00:25:44.810 align:middle line:10%
>>REGINA: Absolutely.

00:25:44.810 --> 00:25:45.160 align:middle line:90%
>>MOULTON HOWE: -everywhere.

00:25:45.160 --> 00:25:46.790 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And not
just the ground.

00:25:46.790 --> 00:25:48.790 align:middle line:84%
I mean, more than the
skin of the Earth telling

00:25:48.790 --> 00:25:50.940 align:middle line:84%
its story, more
than the artifacts,

00:25:50.940 --> 00:25:52.560 align:middle line:90%
people are telling this story.

00:25:52.560 --> 00:25:56.430 align:middle line:84%
And this is the part I find
fascinating because for me, I'm

00:25:56.430 --> 00:25:59.840 align:middle line:84%
totally comfortable with the
notion of the continuation

00:25:59.840 --> 00:26:01.430 align:middle line:90%
of a soul's journey, i.e.

00:26:01.430 --> 00:26:02.470 align:middle line:90%
reincarnation.

00:26:02.470 --> 00:26:06.060 align:middle line:84%
And something came
into our awareness

00:26:06.060 --> 00:26:10.460 align:middle line:84%
rather recently about an
inventor of this time who

00:26:10.460 --> 00:26:16.170 align:middle line:84%
is the reincarnation of a very
famous turn of the 20th century

00:26:16.170 --> 00:26:16.994 align:middle line:90%
inventor.

00:26:16.994 --> 00:26:18.410 align:middle line:84%
And we've talked
to him, and we're

00:26:18.410 --> 00:26:19.790 align:middle line:90%
talking about Patrick Flanagan--

00:26:19.790 --> 00:26:20.980 align:middle line:84%
>>MOULTON HOWE:
And Nikolai Tesla.

00:26:20.980 --> 00:26:22.366 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: -and Nikolai Tesla.

00:26:22.366 --> 00:26:25.820 align:middle line:84%
And we're talking
about a person being

00:26:25.820 --> 00:26:28.850 align:middle line:84%
born that had all of
that knowledge Tesla had.

00:26:28.850 --> 00:26:30.990 align:middle line:84%
Well, all of the knowledge
Tesla had was clearly

00:26:30.990 --> 00:26:33.570 align:middle line:84%
something that's been available
from some previous time

00:26:33.570 --> 00:26:35.109 align:middle line:90%
or Tesla wouldn't have had it.

00:26:35.109 --> 00:26:36.650 align:middle line:84%
And we're talking
about-- when you're

00:26:36.650 --> 00:26:39.110 align:middle line:84%
talking about the pyramid
technology itself,

00:26:39.110 --> 00:26:41.560 align:middle line:84%
as a young man, he wrote a
book called "Pyramid Power."

00:26:41.560 --> 00:26:44.220 align:middle line:84%
For anybody out there who wants
to take this book, "Pyramid

00:26:44.220 --> 00:26:47.410 align:middle line:84%
Power," on, it's
heavily science-based,

00:26:47.410 --> 00:26:48.520 align:middle line:90%
very mathematical.

00:26:48.520 --> 00:26:52.160 align:middle line:84%
But it talks about the full
potential and expression

00:26:52.160 --> 00:26:53.810 align:middle line:90%
of pyramid technology.

00:26:53.810 --> 00:26:56.980 align:middle line:84%
>>MOULTON HOWE: And it brings
up a troubling question.

00:26:56.980 --> 00:27:02.740 align:middle line:84%
Nikolai Tesla, upon his death,
within 24 or 48 hours, the FBI

00:27:02.740 --> 00:27:05.660 align:middle line:84%
and the Patent Office
moved in and they took out

00:27:05.660 --> 00:27:07.720 align:middle line:84%
all of his paperwork
and patents.

00:27:07.720 --> 00:27:08.810 align:middle line:90%
That is a fact.

00:27:08.810 --> 00:27:10.220 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:27:10.220 --> 00:27:16.730 align:middle line:84%
>>MOULTON HOWE: When you go to
this whole issue of a pyramid

00:27:16.730 --> 00:27:20.310 align:middle line:84%
that our government may have
discovered after World War II,

00:27:20.310 --> 00:27:23.680 align:middle line:84%
because we moved
rapidly into Alaska

00:27:23.680 --> 00:27:26.210 align:middle line:84%
with 10,000 engineers
and scientists

00:27:26.210 --> 00:27:29.610 align:middle line:84%
to build the DEW Line and
White Alice with the idea

00:27:29.610 --> 00:27:33.450 align:middle line:84%
that we'd be able to detect
any action from the Soviet

00:27:33.450 --> 00:27:35.270 align:middle line:90%
Union coming over the pole.

00:27:35.270 --> 00:27:40.330 align:middle line:84%
So we had to have magnetic
field grid sensors.

00:27:40.330 --> 00:27:41.220 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:27:41.220 --> 00:27:44.740 align:middle line:84%
>>MOULTON HOWE: And if that's
how they found the pyramid

00:27:44.740 --> 00:27:49.080 align:middle line:84%
and it goes all the way back
to the '50s, and our government

00:27:49.080 --> 00:27:53.110 align:middle line:84%
learned at some point that the
energy that that pyramid could

00:27:53.110 --> 00:27:59.034 align:middle line:84%
give off could power Canada,
what do they know in 2012--

00:27:59.034 --> 00:27:59.700 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: A lot.

00:27:59.700 --> 00:28:02.320 align:middle line:84%
>>MOULTON HOWE: -and where
are we sitting in relationship

00:28:02.320 --> 00:28:05.389 align:middle line:84%
to fossil fuels versus
some kind of pyramid power.

00:28:05.389 --> 00:28:07.680 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Well, we're going
to talk about some of that.

00:28:07.680 --> 00:28:08.770 align:middle line:84%
We're going to take
a little break.

00:28:08.770 --> 00:28:10.989 align:middle line:84%
We have, as you can tell,
much more to talk about.

00:28:10.989 --> 00:28:12.780 align:middle line:84%
We're about jumping
out of our chairs here.

00:28:12.780 --> 00:28:13.613 align:middle line:90%
We'll be right back.

00:28:13.613 --> 00:28:19.940 align:middle line:90%


00:28:19.940 --> 00:28:22.610 align:middle line:84%
We are back and we were
just getting juiced up.

00:28:22.610 --> 00:28:24.705 align:middle line:84%
And Linda, I'm just
chomping at the bit

00:28:24.705 --> 00:28:26.446 align:middle line:84%
to tell this to
you, because we are

00:28:26.446 --> 00:28:29.070 align:middle line:84%
going to be talking with Patrick
Flanagan in a future interview

00:28:29.070 --> 00:28:29.770 align:middle line:90%
here.

00:28:29.770 --> 00:28:32.230 align:middle line:84%
And one of the things I was
drawn into and intrigued about

00:28:32.230 --> 00:28:33.688 align:middle line:84%
was what you just
brought up, which

00:28:33.688 --> 00:28:38.610 align:middle line:84%
is that Tesla's papers were
spirited away after his death.

00:28:38.610 --> 00:28:40.700 align:middle line:84%
18 months later,
Flanagan was born.

00:28:40.700 --> 00:28:42.200 align:middle line:10%
By the time he was
in his 20s, he'd

00:28:42.200 --> 00:28:44.200 align:middle line:10%
written this book
called "Pyramid Power."

00:28:44.200 --> 00:28:46.230 align:middle line:10%
He had made many
other discoveries.

00:28:46.230 --> 00:28:51.050 align:middle line:10%
And in fact, this whole
operation for missile detection

00:28:51.050 --> 00:28:54.290 align:middle line:10%
was built-- $360
million dollars,

00:28:54.290 --> 00:28:59.030 align:middle line:10%
I think, to build that facility
up in Alaska right around 1960,

00:28:59.030 --> 00:29:01.290 align:middle line:10%
'61, '58 in that area.

00:29:01.290 --> 00:29:04.190 align:middle line:84%
Flanagan had built the
exact same missile detection

00:29:04.190 --> 00:29:07.140 align:middle line:90%
device in his garage for $15.

00:29:07.140 --> 00:29:08.800 align:middle line:84%
That's when the men
in black showed up.

00:29:08.800 --> 00:29:10.040 align:middle line:90%
So his life went on.

00:29:10.040 --> 00:29:12.910 align:middle line:84%
But the interesting
thing was he ended up

00:29:12.910 --> 00:29:16.870 align:middle line:90%
in a circle of Tesla admirers.

00:29:16.870 --> 00:29:20.880 align:middle line:84%
And the man who spirited
those papers away,

00:29:20.880 --> 00:29:23.540 align:middle line:84%
I think his name was
Strasburger, Strassenberger,

00:29:23.540 --> 00:29:25.020 align:middle line:90%
something like that.

00:29:25.020 --> 00:29:27.280 align:middle line:90%
You probably know his name.

00:29:27.280 --> 00:29:29.532 align:middle line:90%
We're right around his name.

00:29:29.532 --> 00:29:30.990 align:middle line:84%
>>MOULTON HOWE:
What it underscores

00:29:30.990 --> 00:29:33.870 align:middle line:84%
is how important Tesla
was, and how important he

00:29:33.870 --> 00:29:35.330 align:middle line:90%
was monitored by the government.

00:29:35.330 --> 00:29:36.250 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:29:36.250 --> 00:29:39.680 align:middle line:84%
And Patrick said,
hey, that's who I was.

00:29:39.680 --> 00:29:42.410 align:middle line:84%
And they said if you were
that person, prove it.

00:29:42.410 --> 00:29:44.660 align:middle line:84%
What do you know about the
particle beam generator,

00:29:44.660 --> 00:29:47.540 align:middle line:84%
this longitudinal
wave weapon device?

00:29:47.540 --> 00:29:49.730 align:middle line:84%
And he said, give
me a piece of paper.

00:29:49.730 --> 00:29:52.020 align:middle line:84%
So he drew it out,
drew all the equations,

00:29:52.020 --> 00:29:54.450 align:middle line:84%
the man almost--
his jaw dropped.

00:29:54.450 --> 00:29:57.820 align:middle line:84%
He said, no one could know
that other than Tesla.

00:29:57.820 --> 00:30:00.870 align:middle line:84%
The point is, he's not the only
person on the planet coming

00:30:00.870 --> 00:30:05.670 align:middle line:84%
back with this, we want
to say priority type

00:30:05.670 --> 00:30:07.520 align:middle line:90%
of advanced knowledge.

00:30:07.520 --> 00:30:08.930 align:middle line:90%
He's one of the people.

00:30:08.930 --> 00:30:11.840 align:middle line:84%
They're bringing something back
from some other point in time,

00:30:11.840 --> 00:30:15.110 align:middle line:84%
whether it's time travel
into the future or the past.

00:30:15.110 --> 00:30:19.220 align:middle line:84%
The memories are emerging
now of all this technology.

00:30:19.220 --> 00:30:21.190 align:middle line:10%
>>MOULTON HOWE: I am
really truly beginning

00:30:21.190 --> 00:30:26.340 align:middle line:10%
to think of Earth's history as
these waves of intelligences

00:30:26.340 --> 00:30:30.600 align:middle line:10%
that have used our planet,
terraformed our planet,

00:30:30.600 --> 00:30:35.860 align:middle line:10%
mined our planet so long before
the first primate stood up

00:30:35.860 --> 00:30:40.400 align:middle line:10%
that it is difficult to
have these discussions now

00:30:40.400 --> 00:30:45.440 align:middle line:10%
because the rest of the world
has been so cemented into we

00:30:45.440 --> 00:30:46.920 align:middle line:10%
are alone in the universe.

00:30:46.920 --> 00:30:49.000 align:middle line:10%
When in fact, I
think it's beginning

00:30:49.000 --> 00:30:52.680 align:middle line:10%
to be clear to even the
archaeology community,

00:30:52.680 --> 00:30:57.510 align:middle line:10%
like in Gobekli Tepe, this was
not made by hunter gatherers.

00:30:57.510 --> 00:31:00.740 align:middle line:84%
And if we have these
waves of intelligences

00:31:00.740 --> 00:31:05.740 align:middle line:84%
before, who, what, why, and
what were they terraforming?

00:31:05.740 --> 00:31:11.770 align:middle line:84%
I think what you're saying is
that if we have reincarnation

00:31:11.770 --> 00:31:13.960 align:middle line:84%
as part of the machinery
of the universe,

00:31:13.960 --> 00:31:18.280 align:middle line:84%
and this is a fabric of
existence on this planet,

00:31:18.280 --> 00:31:23.580 align:middle line:84%
then somebody like Nikolai Tesla
might be bringing in his mind

00:31:23.580 --> 00:31:27.610 align:middle line:84%
some of this intelligence and
some of this technology that

00:31:27.610 --> 00:31:30.827 align:middle line:84%
still doesn't exist in the 21st
first century among Cro-Magnon,

00:31:30.827 --> 00:31:31.660 align:middle line:90%
Homo sapien, Sapien.

00:31:31.660 --> 00:31:33.080 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Exactly.

00:31:33.080 --> 00:31:35.030 align:middle line:84%
>>MOULTON HOWE:
And this also goes

00:31:35.030 --> 00:31:38.550 align:middle line:84%
to one of these
huge issues that I

00:31:38.550 --> 00:31:42.590 align:middle line:84%
have had to deal with
now for three decades.

00:31:42.590 --> 00:31:45.660 align:middle line:84%
What is it that the government
of the United States

00:31:45.660 --> 00:31:49.400 align:middle line:84%
is sitting on that they
made some sort of a decision

00:31:49.400 --> 00:31:51.510 align:middle line:90%
at the end of World War II?

00:31:51.510 --> 00:31:53.890 align:middle line:84%
They already had a great
deal of information

00:31:53.890 --> 00:31:59.240 align:middle line:84%
by 1941 with the retrieval
of both bodies and craft

00:31:59.240 --> 00:32:02.770 align:middle line:84%
and technology, including
a piece of technology

00:32:02.770 --> 00:32:07.810 align:middle line:84%
that they referred to as a
neutronic propulsion system.

00:32:07.810 --> 00:32:09.690 align:middle line:84%
It suggests that
the scientists who

00:32:09.690 --> 00:32:12.280 align:middle line:84%
named it were referring
to neutrons, which

00:32:12.280 --> 00:32:18.590 align:middle line:84%
is part of the proton, electron,
neutron at the heart of atoms.

00:32:18.590 --> 00:32:22.900 align:middle line:84%
The inside information is
that when they got this

00:32:22.900 --> 00:32:27.620 align:middle line:84%
from Cape Girardeau,
Missouri, 1941,

00:32:27.620 --> 00:32:32.890 align:middle line:84%
six years before anything
that surfaced out of Roswell,

00:32:32.890 --> 00:32:36.930 align:middle line:84%
that propulsion device
went to Los Alamos.

00:32:36.930 --> 00:32:39.420 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Well, there was also
talk it came out of Germany.

00:32:39.420 --> 00:32:40.461 align:middle line:90%
>>MOULTON HOWE: Well, no.

00:32:40.461 --> 00:32:43.780 align:middle line:84%
But I'm trying to stay in
this thread of our government.

00:32:43.780 --> 00:32:44.580 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:32:44.580 --> 00:32:48.140 align:middle line:84%
>>MOULTON HOWE: Oppenheimer was
already given the assignment

00:32:48.140 --> 00:32:51.840 align:middle line:84%
to start and develop what became
Los Alamos in the development

00:32:51.840 --> 00:32:56.040 align:middle line:84%
of the atomic bomb that
we dropped on Japan.

00:32:56.040 --> 00:33:01.890 align:middle line:84%
So '41, the story is out of
a crashed disc in Missouri,

00:33:01.890 --> 00:33:07.340 align:middle line:84%
we take technology that goes
to New Mexico for this genius,

00:33:07.340 --> 00:33:12.890 align:middle line:84%
Oppenheimer, to
develop, to work on.

00:33:12.890 --> 00:33:16.100 align:middle line:84%
If the government
of the United States

00:33:16.100 --> 00:33:20.450 align:middle line:84%
was already accessing
technology that was not

00:33:20.450 --> 00:33:24.930 align:middle line:84%
from this planet
in '41, the idea

00:33:24.930 --> 00:33:30.090 align:middle line:84%
of there being innocence
about an underground pyramid

00:33:30.090 --> 00:33:35.620 align:middle line:84%
discovered in the '50s is
probably just another cover.

00:33:35.620 --> 00:33:37.260 align:middle line:84%
It means that our
government would

00:33:37.260 --> 00:33:39.830 align:middle line:84%
have been looking
themselves, doing

00:33:39.830 --> 00:33:43.070 align:middle line:84%
what I've been trying to
do by going to Turkey.

00:33:43.070 --> 00:33:46.100 align:middle line:84%
Those of us who keep hitting
this information fresh,

00:33:46.100 --> 00:33:49.780 align:middle line:84%
the government was probably
already doing in World War II

00:33:49.780 --> 00:33:50.280 align:middle line:90%
time.

00:33:50.280 --> 00:33:52.770 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: I think it
sounds safe to assume that.

00:33:52.770 --> 00:33:57.730 align:middle line:84%
>>MOULTON HOWE: So now
you step back and you say,

00:33:57.730 --> 00:34:03.780 align:middle line:84%
if Lieutenant Colonel Philip J
Corso who fought in the army,

00:34:03.780 --> 00:34:06.190 align:middle line:84%
who was hand-picked by
General Arthur Trudeau--

00:34:06.190 --> 00:34:07.260 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Love the man.

00:34:07.260 --> 00:34:09.320 align:middle line:84%
>>MOULTON HOWE: -who was
hand-picked by Dwight D

00:34:09.320 --> 00:34:14.900 align:middle line:84%
Eisenhower, Trudeau was the only
PhD in electrical engineering

00:34:14.900 --> 00:34:17.699 align:middle line:84%
who fought in World
War II in the army.

00:34:17.699 --> 00:34:18.740 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Hand chose him.

00:34:18.740 --> 00:34:20.364 align:middle line:84%
>>MOULTON HOWE: And
Dwight D Eisenhower

00:34:20.364 --> 00:34:22.050 align:middle line:84%
knew and respected
him, and put him

00:34:22.050 --> 00:34:25.199 align:middle line:84%
in charge of R&D, the first
one coming out of World War II.

00:34:25.199 --> 00:34:26.889 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Foreign
Technology Office.

00:34:26.889 --> 00:34:31.420 align:middle line:84%
>>MOULTON HOWE: And Trudeau
knew Corso out of Italy, hand

00:34:31.420 --> 00:34:32.429 align:middle line:90%
picks him.

00:34:32.429 --> 00:34:35.310 align:middle line:84%
And what does that
story boil down to?

00:34:35.310 --> 00:34:36.987 align:middle line:90%
I believe Colonel Corso--

00:34:36.987 --> 00:34:37.820 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: I do, too.

00:34:37.820 --> 00:34:39.449 align:middle line:84%
>>MOULTON HOWE: -not the
critics and the debunkers.

00:34:39.449 --> 00:34:40.060 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Thank you.

00:34:40.060 --> 00:34:41.809 align:middle line:84%
I'm so glad to hear
you say that because--

00:34:41.809 --> 00:34:44.710 align:middle line:84%
>>MOULTON HOWE: They were
taking the technology,

00:34:44.710 --> 00:34:47.290 align:middle line:84%
whether it was from Missouri,
whether it was from Texas,

00:34:47.290 --> 00:34:50.380 align:middle line:84%
whether it was from New
Mexico, wherever it was.

00:34:50.380 --> 00:34:55.030 align:middle line:84%
And General Arthur Trudeau
showed Colonel Corso

00:34:55.030 --> 00:34:58.199 align:middle line:84%
in his office in the
Pentagon a file drawer.

00:34:58.199 --> 00:34:59.490 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: A file cabinet, yeah.

00:34:59.490 --> 00:35:02.010 align:middle line:84%
>>MOULTON HOWE: Corso told
me, he said it was amazing.

00:35:02.010 --> 00:35:04.850 align:middle line:84%
The general walks over
and pulls open a drawer

00:35:04.850 --> 00:35:07.630 align:middle line:84%
and starts lifting this
stuff out and saying,

00:35:07.630 --> 00:35:09.910 align:middle line:84%
this is extra-terrestrial
technology

00:35:09.910 --> 00:35:13.170 align:middle line:84%
we have taken out of
these crashed craft.

00:35:13.170 --> 00:35:15.620 align:middle line:84%
And he said, "Your
job is going to be--

00:35:15.620 --> 00:35:17.731 align:middle line:84%
I'm the one who will
set up the meeting."

00:35:17.731 --> 00:35:19.230 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: I remember
he said he felt

00:35:19.230 --> 00:35:22.790 align:middle line:84%
like a little kid at Christmas
time in his apartment or home

00:35:22.790 --> 00:35:26.410 align:middle line:84%
with this stuff spread out
on the floor thinking, what

00:35:26.410 --> 00:35:27.670 align:middle line:90%
is this stuff?

00:35:27.670 --> 00:35:28.810 align:middle line:90%
And it was his job--

00:35:28.810 --> 00:35:30.880 align:middle line:90%
>>MOULTON HOWE: To hand carry.

00:35:30.880 --> 00:35:34.050 align:middle line:84%
And that's what a lot
of people lose sight of.

00:35:34.050 --> 00:35:39.930 align:middle line:84%
We're talking about what, 15
to 20 years after the war?

00:35:39.930 --> 00:35:43.800 align:middle line:84%
We are still in a post-war
counterintelligence,

00:35:43.800 --> 00:35:45.080 align:middle line:90%
extremely sophisticated world.

00:35:45.080 --> 00:35:46.710 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Yeah, they started
reverse engineering in '61,

00:35:46.710 --> 00:35:47.210 align:middle line:90%
I think.

00:35:47.210 --> 00:35:48.710 align:middle line:84%
>>MOULTON HOWE:
And it would have

00:35:48.710 --> 00:35:53.650 align:middle line:84%
been Trudeau would know
one man, let's say,

00:35:53.650 --> 00:35:57.040 align:middle line:90%
in any one of the corporations.

00:35:57.040 --> 00:36:01.170 align:middle line:84%
Corning Glass was
very much involved.

00:36:01.170 --> 00:36:02.190 align:middle line:90%
Makes one contact--

00:36:02.190 --> 00:36:04.010 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: I thought
Bell Labs was.

00:36:04.010 --> 00:36:04.730 align:middle line:84%
>>MOULTON HOWE: Yeah,
but I'm just saying.

00:36:04.730 --> 00:36:06.271 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: All of
the main guys, yeah.

00:36:06.271 --> 00:36:08.250 align:middle line:84%
>>MOULTON HOWE: So
let's say Corning Glass.

00:36:08.250 --> 00:36:10.730 align:middle line:90%
It isn't a phone call.

00:36:10.730 --> 00:36:13.400 align:middle line:84%
General Trudeau would
have had a meeting

00:36:13.400 --> 00:36:17.890 align:middle line:84%
with the person in Corning
Glass, whoever was hand-picked,

00:36:17.890 --> 00:36:20.094 align:middle line:84%
and they discuss
what's going to happen.

00:36:20.094 --> 00:36:20.760 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:36:20.760 --> 00:36:23.750 align:middle line:84%
>>MOULTON HOWE: And then Philip
Corso would have a meeting

00:36:23.750 --> 00:36:27.320 align:middle line:84%
and a physical item would be
transported to one person.

00:36:27.320 --> 00:36:29.980 align:middle line:90%
So only three human beings know.

00:36:29.980 --> 00:36:32.570 align:middle line:90%


00:36:32.570 --> 00:36:34.930 align:middle line:84%
I hope that the audience
understands this.

00:36:34.930 --> 00:36:36.410 align:middle line:90%
It's just the way this worked.

00:36:36.410 --> 00:36:37.784 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: It's
compartmentalized.

00:36:37.784 --> 00:36:40.000 align:middle line:84%
>>MOULTON HOWE: And
all of the scientists,

00:36:40.000 --> 00:36:43.830 align:middle line:84%
all of the administrators,
everybody in Corning Glass

00:36:43.830 --> 00:36:46.440 align:middle line:84%
would never have
known the source.

00:36:46.440 --> 00:36:50.540 align:middle line:84%
It would have been given
as a research project,

00:36:50.540 --> 00:36:53.500 align:middle line:84%
and eventually a patent
would be evolved,

00:36:53.500 --> 00:36:58.590 align:middle line:84%
and everybody in that
corporation is out of the loop.

00:36:58.590 --> 00:37:04.400 align:middle line:84%
Today in 2012, what
really intrigues me,

00:37:04.400 --> 00:37:12.010 align:middle line:84%
if the John Smith
father in '59 to '61

00:37:12.010 --> 00:37:16.680 align:middle line:84%
was going in a mine shaft
elevator down 700 feet,

00:37:16.680 --> 00:37:21.630 align:middle line:84%
coming into a base that he
worked in for two plus years,

00:37:21.630 --> 00:37:27.580 align:middle line:84%
knew that it would give off
tremendous amounts of energy,

00:37:27.580 --> 00:37:32.620 align:middle line:84%
did somebody make a decision
to close down that pyramid?

00:37:32.620 --> 00:37:35.370 align:middle line:90%
And how did they do it, and why?

00:37:35.370 --> 00:37:37.370 align:middle line:90%
Why am I saying this?

00:37:37.370 --> 00:37:45.050 align:middle line:84%
'78 clearly that group that
went out in the helicopter

00:37:45.050 --> 00:37:47.590 align:middle line:84%
had some kind of
magnetic interference,

00:37:47.590 --> 00:37:48.980 align:middle line:90%
and they were briefed.

00:37:48.980 --> 00:37:51.180 align:middle line:84%
And that meant
that our government

00:37:51.180 --> 00:37:55.360 align:middle line:84%
knew that this crew
had to be briefed.

00:37:55.360 --> 00:37:57.350 align:middle line:90%
What happened after '78?

00:37:57.350 --> 00:38:00.330 align:middle line:84%
Because there have
been crews-- and I've

00:38:00.330 --> 00:38:02.560 align:middle line:84%
been doing a lot of
research on this--

00:38:02.560 --> 00:38:09.510 align:middle line:84%
flying around Mount
McKinley now '78 to 2012.

00:38:09.510 --> 00:38:14.070 align:middle line:84%
There's not a single report and
I'm-- I'm saying, Linda Howe,

00:38:14.070 --> 00:38:17.930 align:middle line:84%
investigative reporter-- I had
been talking to people who do

00:38:17.930 --> 00:38:23.440 align:middle line:84%
$500,000 research projects,
taking big classified

00:38:23.440 --> 00:38:28.740 align:middle line:84%
magnetometers and put them in
tow on airplanes for whether

00:38:28.740 --> 00:38:33.800 align:middle line:84%
it's the Defense Department
or fossil fuel, natural gas.

00:38:33.800 --> 00:38:37.060 align:middle line:10%
They're out there all
the time, and there's not

00:38:37.060 --> 00:38:42.160 align:middle line:10%
one single report of the
current age of anybody having

00:38:42.160 --> 00:38:46.520 align:middle line:10%
any kind of magnetic
field anomalies.

00:38:46.520 --> 00:38:51.280 align:middle line:10%
What is it that will
disconnect the power?

00:38:51.280 --> 00:38:54.660 align:middle line:84%
It's been suggested to me in
an email since I started doing

00:38:54.660 --> 00:38:59.030 align:middle line:84%
this work, by somebody that
I can't put on the air,

00:38:59.030 --> 00:39:02.500 align:middle line:84%
I cannot use their name, it's
a terrible situation to be

00:39:02.500 --> 00:39:03.940 align:middle line:90%
in as a reporter.

00:39:03.940 --> 00:39:09.460 align:middle line:84%
But I can at least
share this as what if.

00:39:09.460 --> 00:39:15.675 align:middle line:84%
That if the capstones of
specific pyramids are removed,

00:39:15.675 --> 00:39:21.327 align:middle line:84%
it might disconnect the
entire ancient power grid.

00:39:21.327 --> 00:39:22.660 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: That would make sense.

00:39:22.660 --> 00:39:25.830 align:middle line:84%
It would totally change
the geometrical structure

00:39:25.830 --> 00:39:27.570 align:middle line:84%
and the energetic
potentials of it

00:39:27.570 --> 00:39:30.621 align:middle line:84%
if you remove what was called in
the Great Pyramid the "Benben,"

00:39:30.621 --> 00:39:31.120 align:middle line:90%
right?

00:39:31.120 --> 00:39:33.750 align:middle line:84%
>>MOULTON HOWE: And
in this email here

00:39:33.750 --> 00:39:37.300 align:middle line:90%
was the kicker, the punch line.

00:39:37.300 --> 00:39:40.290 align:middle line:84%
Would our government ever
have had the knowledge

00:39:40.290 --> 00:39:43.140 align:middle line:84%
to do this disconnect,
or are we talking

00:39:43.140 --> 00:39:46.190 align:middle line:84%
about the ancient
intelligences that

00:39:46.190 --> 00:39:49.430 align:middle line:84%
have been and used
this Earth in waves

00:39:49.430 --> 00:39:53.410 align:middle line:84%
for perhaps millions
of years who

00:39:53.410 --> 00:39:57.430 align:middle line:84%
would know how to disconnect
and would have done this

00:39:57.430 --> 00:40:03.320 align:middle line:84%
on purpose to keep humans
essentially still using fire

00:40:03.320 --> 00:40:05.089 align:middle line:90%
until what point in the future?

00:40:05.089 --> 00:40:05.630 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: OK.

00:40:05.630 --> 00:40:09.990 align:middle line:84%
So to play devil's advocate on
that, that's entirely possible.

00:40:09.990 --> 00:40:13.250 align:middle line:84%
I mean, that would be probably
one prevailing theory--

00:40:13.250 --> 00:40:14.830 align:middle line:90%
the largest prevailing theory.

00:40:14.830 --> 00:40:17.630 align:middle line:84%
I'm just looking at it from
the other point of view, too.

00:40:17.630 --> 00:40:21.360 align:middle line:84%
If like Tesla's
concern was the energy,

00:40:21.360 --> 00:40:22.890 align:middle line:84%
if it were to be
used incorrectly,

00:40:22.890 --> 00:40:24.973 align:middle line:84%
it was one of the most
powerful destructive forces

00:40:24.973 --> 00:40:26.030 align:middle line:90%
on the planet.

00:40:26.030 --> 00:40:26.700 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:40:26.700 --> 00:40:30.230 align:middle line:84%
We've kind of seen how atomic
energy has borne out over time.

00:40:30.230 --> 00:40:32.960 align:middle line:90%


00:40:32.960 --> 00:40:33.460 align:middle line:90%
Is it also--

00:40:33.460 --> 00:40:36.060 align:middle line:84%
>>MOULTON HOWE: But don't
mix the apples and oranges.

00:40:36.060 --> 00:40:38.697 align:middle line:84%
Atomic is one thing, pyramid
power is completely different.

00:40:38.697 --> 00:40:40.030 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: No, I understand that.

00:40:40.030 --> 00:40:43.080 align:middle line:84%
But I'm saying, we're talking
about advanced free energy

00:40:43.080 --> 00:40:45.740 align:middle line:84%
gathering from the
forces of nature

00:40:45.740 --> 00:40:47.990 align:middle line:84%
and compressing or
condensing, and then--

00:40:47.990 --> 00:40:48.790 align:middle line:84%
>>MOULTON HOWE: We
don't know how it works.

00:40:48.790 --> 00:40:50.373 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: -being
able to project them.

00:40:50.373 --> 00:40:52.420 align:middle line:84%
But his concern was
it would be used

00:40:52.420 --> 00:40:57.200 align:middle line:84%
for potentially
destructive purposes.

00:40:57.200 --> 00:41:01.720 align:middle line:90%
That's a genuine concern.

00:41:01.720 --> 00:41:04.270 align:middle line:84%
In terms of who disabled
this technology,

00:41:04.270 --> 00:41:06.444 align:middle line:84%
I would tend to think the
government has had access

00:41:06.444 --> 00:41:08.610 align:middle line:84%
to this information for
quite a long time as to what

00:41:08.610 --> 00:41:10.790 align:middle line:90%
the capabilities might be.

00:41:10.790 --> 00:41:15.220 align:middle line:84%
Is it possible that they were
disabled until a point came

00:41:15.220 --> 00:41:17.814 align:middle line:84%
where we really had matured
enough on one level,

00:41:17.814 --> 00:41:19.230 align:middle line:84%
that's certainly
another question.

00:41:19.230 --> 00:41:20.300 align:middle line:84%
>>MOULTON HOWE: That's
the implication.

00:41:20.300 --> 00:41:22.174 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Well, do you
know Judy Wood's work?

00:41:22.174 --> 00:41:23.720 align:middle line:90%
Doctor Judy Wood and 9/11?

00:41:23.720 --> 00:41:24.030 align:middle line:90%
>>MOULTON HOWE: Yes.

00:41:24.030 --> 00:41:25.613 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: We interviewed
her and she's

00:41:25.613 --> 00:41:27.970 align:middle line:90%
saying that was a Tesla device.

00:41:27.970 --> 00:41:32.660 align:middle line:84%
She's saying that was a Tesla
device, and her evidence--

00:41:32.660 --> 00:41:35.430 align:middle line:84%
she's highly qualified,
incredible evidence.

00:41:35.430 --> 00:41:38.400 align:middle line:84%
But to the effect that that was
justified through a Tesla type

00:41:38.400 --> 00:41:41.350 align:middle line:84%
technology, her
interest and concern

00:41:41.350 --> 00:41:43.890 align:middle line:84%
is if we saw with
our own eyes what

00:41:43.890 --> 00:41:47.260 align:middle line:84%
it can do in a destructive way,
what happens if you harness it

00:41:47.260 --> 00:41:48.640 align:middle line:90%
for peaceful purposes?

00:41:48.640 --> 00:41:50.223 align:middle line:84%
>>MOULTON HOWE: The
problem with using

00:41:50.223 --> 00:41:55.000 align:middle line:84%
the word Tesla device,
his greatest claim to fame

00:41:55.000 --> 00:41:57.420 align:middle line:90%
would be alternating current.

00:41:57.420 --> 00:42:03.120 align:middle line:84%
And that's-- so he was involved
with what we would say Edison

00:42:03.120 --> 00:42:07.400 align:middle line:90%
versus Tesla, DC versus AC--

00:42:07.400 --> 00:42:09.060 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Which was
one thing he did.

00:42:09.060 --> 00:42:09.410 align:middle line:90%
>>MOULTON HOWE: Yeah.

00:42:09.410 --> 00:42:10.341 align:middle line:90%
And it's only one.

00:42:10.341 --> 00:42:10.840 align:middle line:90%
And then--

00:42:10.840 --> 00:42:11.410 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: That's only one thing.

00:42:11.410 --> 00:42:12.375 align:middle line:84%
He still had the
particle beam generator.

00:42:12.375 --> 00:42:13.650 align:middle line:84%
>>MOULTON HOWE: And then he
was dealing with turbines,

00:42:13.650 --> 00:42:16.220 align:middle line:84%
and then he was dealing
with electrostatic energy.

00:42:16.220 --> 00:42:18.820 align:middle line:84%
And there's that famous
photograph where he picks up

00:42:18.820 --> 00:42:21.240 align:middle line:84%
that fluorescent
tube and you see

00:42:21.240 --> 00:42:24.400 align:middle line:84%
all of the electrostatic
air, and he's

00:42:24.400 --> 00:42:26.960 align:middle line:84%
sitting there in a chair or
standing up with this tube

00:42:26.960 --> 00:42:28.300 align:middle line:90%
and it's lighted.

00:42:28.300 --> 00:42:32.020 align:middle line:84%
That is the direction in which
I think when people are thinking

00:42:32.020 --> 00:42:36.960 align:middle line:84%
about Tesla, that was his
demonstration, that he could

00:42:36.960 --> 00:42:39.110 align:middle line:84%
light the tube in an
electrostatic field.

00:42:39.110 --> 00:42:40.110 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: No, I'm talking
particle beam generator.

00:42:40.110 --> 00:42:41.901 align:middle line:84%
I'm talking about the
other technology that

00:42:41.901 --> 00:42:46.260 align:middle line:84%
was sequestered and put in
a safe that that man, Frank

00:42:46.260 --> 00:42:49.064 align:middle line:84%
Strassberger, Strausberger or
something, whatever it was.

00:42:49.064 --> 00:42:50.730 align:middle line:84%
>>MOULTON HOWE: Well,
the important part

00:42:50.730 --> 00:42:54.900 align:middle line:84%
of Tesla to me, to the
pyramid, the parallel,

00:42:54.900 --> 00:42:57.440 align:middle line:84%
is the demonstration
that he was dealing

00:42:57.440 --> 00:43:01.210 align:middle line:84%
with electrostatic fields and
had the idea that he could

00:43:01.210 --> 00:43:03.420 align:middle line:84%
build these towers
that would generate,

00:43:03.420 --> 00:43:06.500 align:middle line:84%
in some sort of
a way, waves that

00:43:06.500 --> 00:43:09.430 align:middle line:84%
would start going around
the planet-- standing waves

00:43:09.430 --> 00:43:14.350 align:middle line:84%
from, I think,
electrostatic energy.

00:43:14.350 --> 00:43:16.730 align:middle line:84%
And it is extremely
interesting that when

00:43:16.730 --> 00:43:21.250 align:middle line:84%
you come to the discs,
triangles, spheres,

00:43:21.250 --> 00:43:24.320 align:middle line:84%
whatever you-- there's such a
variety that people have either

00:43:24.320 --> 00:43:27.250 align:middle line:84%
photographed or
drawn in the-- we'll

00:43:27.250 --> 00:43:30.850 align:middle line:84%
call it the unidentified
flying object field-- what

00:43:30.850 --> 00:43:34.670 align:middle line:84%
is one of the most common
denominators over 60,

00:43:34.670 --> 00:43:37.760 align:middle line:90%
70, 100 years?

00:43:37.760 --> 00:43:42.410 align:middle line:84%
People will see what
they think is a cloud.

00:43:42.410 --> 00:43:48.930 align:middle line:84%
And the cloud will suddenly
change into a disc or a sphere

00:43:48.930 --> 00:43:51.032 align:middle line:90%
or a triangle or a cigar.

00:43:51.032 --> 00:43:52.990 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: It can be also
an unidentified flying

00:43:52.990 --> 00:43:54.130 align:middle line:90%
object shaped cloud.

00:43:54.130 --> 00:43:56.430 align:middle line:84%
>>MOULTON HOWE: What
I'm coming to is

00:43:56.430 --> 00:44:01.460 align:middle line:90%
electrostatic fields can ionize.

00:44:01.460 --> 00:44:03.820 align:middle line:90%
Ionization can glow.

00:44:03.820 --> 00:44:06.440 align:middle line:90%
It's a plasma.

00:44:06.440 --> 00:44:10.900 align:middle line:84%
So in the phenomenon itself
just to eyewitnesses,

00:44:10.900 --> 00:44:15.170 align:middle line:84%
you have this link between
ionization-- glowing ionization

00:44:15.170 --> 00:44:17.580 align:middle line:90%
around their craft.

00:44:17.580 --> 00:44:22.560 align:middle line:84%
Tesla was saying that he
could use electrostatic fields

00:44:22.560 --> 00:44:26.800 align:middle line:84%
in these towers to create
standing waves that would then

00:44:26.800 --> 00:44:30.860 align:middle line:84%
be free energy around the planet
that everyone could lift up

00:44:30.860 --> 00:44:35.480 align:middle line:84%
their lights or somehow just
that's it, you just have a rod,

00:44:35.480 --> 00:44:37.140 align:middle line:90%
and you would power a house.

00:44:37.140 --> 00:44:38.200 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:44:38.200 --> 00:44:40.740 align:middle line:84%
>>MOULTON HOWE: That
is where, to me--

00:44:40.740 --> 00:44:42.407 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: That's the
pyramid technology.

00:44:42.407 --> 00:44:43.615 align:middle line:90%
>>MOULTON HOWE: That's right.

00:44:43.615 --> 00:44:44.180 align:middle line:90%
I agree.

00:44:44.180 --> 00:44:47.520 align:middle line:84%
And if there has
been a disconnect--

00:44:47.520 --> 00:44:49.910 align:middle line:84%
I don't know this
for a fact-- if there

00:44:49.910 --> 00:44:53.770 align:middle line:84%
has been a disconnect
of the grid, who did it?

00:44:53.770 --> 00:44:57.110 align:middle line:84%
And if there has not been
a disconnect of the grid,

00:44:57.110 --> 00:44:59.950 align:middle line:84%
is it actually functioning
and we don't know it?

00:44:59.950 --> 00:45:02.290 align:middle line:90%
And is the government using it?

00:45:02.290 --> 00:45:06.500 align:middle line:84%
And then, where does
something like Gobekli Tepe

00:45:06.500 --> 00:45:09.920 align:middle line:84%
that Robert Schoch standing
there right next to me

00:45:09.920 --> 00:45:11.690 align:middle line:84%
is looking at these
and says, "You know,

00:45:11.690 --> 00:45:16.380 align:middle line:84%
Linda, every time I look at
these T-shaped, thin, elegant

00:45:16.380 --> 00:45:18.730 align:middle line:84%
limestone tall
pillars," he said,

00:45:18.730 --> 00:45:22.500 align:middle line:90%
"I think of tuning forks."

00:45:22.500 --> 00:45:25.660 align:middle line:84%
And now, all over,
people are beginning

00:45:25.660 --> 00:45:31.190 align:middle line:84%
to report in various papers
Stonehenge might have been

00:45:31.190 --> 00:45:37.760 align:middle line:84%
involved with frequencies,
that Malta, the Hypogeum built

00:45:37.760 --> 00:45:42.420 align:middle line:84%
in order to function at
110 to 115 Hertz frequency,

00:45:42.420 --> 00:45:44.660 align:middle line:90%
the sound of a male's voice.

00:45:44.660 --> 00:45:47.830 align:middle line:84%
What would this planet
have been 12,000 years ago

00:45:47.830 --> 00:45:50.680 align:middle line:84%
when Gobekli Tepe
was first built?

00:45:50.680 --> 00:45:54.500 align:middle line:84%
Would it have been that sound
itself was involved in some

00:45:54.500 --> 00:45:57.532 align:middle line:84%
sort of a global-- I'm
going to say technology--

00:45:57.532 --> 00:45:59.740 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Well, that's partly
what Christopher Dunn--

00:45:59.740 --> 00:46:00.660 align:middle line:84%
>>MOULTON HOWE: -that there
may have been resonance.

00:46:00.660 --> 00:46:01.700 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes, exactly.

00:46:01.700 --> 00:46:02.015 align:middle line:90%
Resonance.

00:46:02.015 --> 00:46:03.040 align:middle line:84%
>>MOULTON HOWE:
And the pyramids--

00:46:03.040 --> 00:46:04.020 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Right,
are part of that.

00:46:04.020 --> 00:46:04.800 align:middle line:84%
>>MOULTON HOWE:
-were part of it.

00:46:04.800 --> 00:46:06.174 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So I
have another thing

00:46:06.174 --> 00:46:08.220 align:middle line:84%
to bring up then just
to toss out there.

00:46:08.220 --> 00:46:11.140 align:middle line:84%
If species from other
planets, maybe even

00:46:11.140 --> 00:46:13.600 align:middle line:84%
a variety of them, maybe even
over hundreds of millions

00:46:13.600 --> 00:46:17.310 align:middle line:84%
of years, not just 50,
25, 10,000 years ago

00:46:17.310 --> 00:46:19.850 align:middle line:84%
were building these
things, they were clearly

00:46:19.850 --> 00:46:21.510 align:middle line:84%
building them for
their own purposes.

00:46:21.510 --> 00:46:22.960 align:middle line:90%
These weren't for human use.

00:46:22.960 --> 00:46:23.100 align:middle line:90%
>>MOULTON HOWE: No.

00:46:23.100 --> 00:46:24.550 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Nor
consumption purpose

00:46:24.550 --> 00:46:27.070 align:middle line:84%
for our understanding
or anything.

00:46:27.070 --> 00:46:30.150 align:middle line:84%
So let's say we are now
refining our knowledge

00:46:30.150 --> 00:46:32.250 align:middle line:84%
and opening or intellect
up as a species

00:46:32.250 --> 00:46:36.342 align:middle line:84%
to be able to grok what the
potential of these things are.

00:46:36.342 --> 00:46:38.300 align:middle line:84%
And when you're bringing
up the question of who

00:46:38.300 --> 00:46:39.674 align:middle line:84%
could have removed
the capstones,

00:46:39.674 --> 00:46:45.135 align:middle line:84%
really is that our-- on one
level, it's interesting,

00:46:45.135 --> 00:46:47.380 align:middle line:90%
but that's not our technology.

00:46:47.380 --> 00:46:49.220 align:middle line:84%
If they removed the
capstones, does there

00:46:49.220 --> 00:46:52.980 align:middle line:84%
have to necessarily be a human
interface type of agenda to it?

00:46:52.980 --> 00:46:54.730 align:middle line:84%
>>MOULTON HOWE: Well,
it's how would our--

00:46:54.730 --> 00:46:57.470 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Could it simply
be that's their technology.

00:46:57.470 --> 00:46:59.130 align:middle line:84%
Maybe they're not
using it and they

00:46:59.130 --> 00:47:00.640 align:middle line:84%
don't want it used
by anybody else.

00:47:00.640 --> 00:47:01.640 align:middle line:90%
>>MOULTON HOWE: Exactly.

00:47:01.640 --> 00:47:04.870 align:middle line:84%
But how would our government
have ever determined

00:47:04.870 --> 00:47:07.430 align:middle line:84%
that it would give
off enough power

00:47:07.430 --> 00:47:10.930 align:middle line:90%
to power the nation of Canada?

00:47:10.930 --> 00:47:16.990 align:middle line:84%
Somebody did something in
a test and concluded this?

00:47:16.990 --> 00:47:23.910 align:middle line:84%
Well, why can't we move, why
can't the revolution now move

00:47:23.910 --> 00:47:24.410 align:middle line:90%
to that?

00:47:24.410 --> 00:47:26.340 align:middle line:84%
Let the chips fall
where they may,

00:47:26.340 --> 00:47:28.390 align:middle line:84%
let the governments
of the world say,

00:47:28.390 --> 00:47:31.330 align:middle line:84%
we're going out of fossil
fuels, ladies and gentlemen,

00:47:31.330 --> 00:47:33.207 align:middle line:84%
because this is what
we now understand.

00:47:33.207 --> 00:47:35.540 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: But don't you think
we're really approaching--

00:47:35.540 --> 00:47:37.930 align:middle line:84%
recently, I interviewed
Sterling Allan.

00:47:37.930 --> 00:47:41.280 align:middle line:84%
I don't know if you know of him,
but he has the PESWiki site.

00:47:41.280 --> 00:47:43.390 align:middle line:84%
And his job is
basically like you,

00:47:43.390 --> 00:47:46.060 align:middle line:84%
an investigative reporter
going around the planet,

00:47:46.060 --> 00:47:49.102 align:middle line:84%
and first-hand interfacing
with the inventors

00:47:49.102 --> 00:47:50.810 align:middle line:84%
of all the leading-edge
technologies that

00:47:50.810 --> 00:47:54.820 align:middle line:84%
are coming close to market, real
viability and actually close

00:47:54.820 --> 00:47:55.740 align:middle line:90%
to market.

00:47:55.740 --> 00:47:57.790 align:middle line:84%
Some of them are
literally months away.

00:47:57.790 --> 00:47:59.822 align:middle line:90%
They're all free energy devices.

00:47:59.822 --> 00:48:00.780 align:middle line:90%
They're very different.

00:48:00.780 --> 00:48:02.720 align:middle line:84%
Three of them happen
to be cold fusion,

00:48:02.720 --> 00:48:04.770 align:middle line:84%
but there are other
motor generators,

00:48:04.770 --> 00:48:06.600 align:middle line:90%
perpetual motion of sorts.

00:48:06.600 --> 00:48:10.090 align:middle line:84%
There is the Keshe technology,
which is far advanced

00:48:10.090 --> 00:48:12.490 align:middle line:84%
of all of that even,
and it's all coming.

00:48:12.490 --> 00:48:14.600 align:middle line:84%
It's like it's right
around the corner.

00:48:14.600 --> 00:48:19.350 align:middle line:84%
I think the pyramidal structure
in geometry and mathematics

00:48:19.350 --> 00:48:25.570 align:middle line:84%
offers us something maybe very
organic and elegant and simple

00:48:25.570 --> 00:48:29.490 align:middle line:84%
that can be tapped into
for our energy purposes,

00:48:29.490 --> 00:48:31.870 align:middle line:84%
maybe on a small scale,
maybe on a large scale.

00:48:31.870 --> 00:48:33.682 align:middle line:90%
But maybe it's just one thing.

00:48:33.682 --> 00:48:35.640 align:middle line:84%
>>MOULTON HOWE: Well, we
come back to the irony

00:48:35.640 --> 00:48:40.560 align:middle line:84%
that the pyramid underground
may be the first path taking us

00:48:40.560 --> 00:48:43.040 align:middle line:84%
directly to evidence
of extraterrestrials

00:48:43.040 --> 00:48:43.957 align:middle line:90%
on this planet, right?

00:48:43.957 --> 00:48:45.956 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: We're kind of
jumping the gun assuming

00:48:45.956 --> 00:48:46.960 align:middle line:90%
that, but yeah.

00:48:46.960 --> 00:48:51.160 align:middle line:84%
>>MOULTON HOWE: But, it also
goes right back to Gobekli

00:48:51.160 --> 00:48:51.829 align:middle line:90%
because--

00:48:51.829 --> 00:48:53.620 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Let's talk
about-- we have some--

00:48:53.620 --> 00:48:54.580 align:middle line:84%
>>MOULTON HOWE: We
went to the museum.

00:48:54.580 --> 00:48:57.205 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: I want to say that we
have images, would you please--

00:48:57.205 --> 00:49:00.400 align:middle line:84%
we're going to bring some images
up and they're-- first of all,

00:49:00.400 --> 00:49:02.660 align:middle line:84%
the first image you're going
to see is the large site

00:49:02.660 --> 00:49:03.790 align:middle line:90%
and the digs.

00:49:03.790 --> 00:49:05.780 align:middle line:84%
And the second image
you're going to see

00:49:05.780 --> 00:49:08.362 align:middle line:84%
is going to be of that very
strange statue, not the man.

00:49:08.362 --> 00:49:10.820 align:middle line:84%
>>MOULTON HOWE: And that's just
exactly where I was headed.

00:49:10.820 --> 00:49:11.653 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Thank you.

00:49:11.653 --> 00:49:13.340 align:middle line:84%
>>MOULTON HOWE:
Because at Gobekli,

00:49:13.340 --> 00:49:16.710 align:middle line:84%
after we had had this
experience down with the pillars

00:49:16.710 --> 00:49:21.110 align:middle line:84%
and no one could feel what
is this for outside of shock,

00:49:21.110 --> 00:49:25.500 align:middle line:84%
saying maybe tuning forks that
would resonate in a frequency.

00:49:25.500 --> 00:49:27.690 align:middle line:90%
We went to the museum in Urfa.

00:49:27.690 --> 00:49:29.880 align:middle line:84%
And for the last
five years or so,

00:49:29.880 --> 00:49:32.240 align:middle line:84%
they have been taking
some of the most valuable

00:49:32.240 --> 00:49:34.540 align:middle line:84%
of all of the stone
things that they

00:49:34.540 --> 00:49:37.721 align:middle line:84%
have found-- not just
pillars, a totem.

00:49:37.721 --> 00:49:39.470 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: The one we
just saw a moment ago

00:49:39.470 --> 00:49:42.310 align:middle line:90%
was one of the totem angles.

00:49:42.310 --> 00:49:45.180 align:middle line:84%
>>MOULTON HOWE: And
very bizarre creatures.

00:49:45.180 --> 00:49:48.320 align:middle line:84%
And they have been protecting
them in the museum.

00:49:48.320 --> 00:49:49.836 align:middle line:90%
And I walked in--

00:49:49.836 --> 00:49:51.710 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: We're looking
"Urfa Man" right now.

00:49:51.710 --> 00:49:55.120 align:middle line:84%
>>MOULTON HOWE: -to-- that was
the first thing that I came to.

00:49:55.120 --> 00:50:00.600 align:middle line:84%
And you stand in front of this
well done-- it could be today,

00:50:00.600 --> 00:50:02.720 align:middle line:84%
a modern artist
today could have done

00:50:02.720 --> 00:50:07.050 align:middle line:84%
this very sophisticated
sculpture-- no hair,

00:50:07.050 --> 00:50:13.620 align:middle line:84%
very little ears, a huge
nose had been on this

00:50:13.620 --> 00:50:15.300 align:middle line:90%
and it's broken off.

00:50:15.300 --> 00:50:19.010 align:middle line:84%
But what you are first looking
at, and you can't look away,

00:50:19.010 --> 00:50:24.180 align:middle line:84%
are obsidian crystals in
perfectly circular eye holes

00:50:24.180 --> 00:50:26.900 align:middle line:90%
that stick out 3/4 to an inch.

00:50:26.900 --> 00:50:29.770 align:middle line:84%
And I tried to photograph to
get the feeling that you're

00:50:29.770 --> 00:50:33.170 align:middle line:84%
looking into depth, you're
looking into facets,

00:50:33.170 --> 00:50:36.320 align:middle line:84%
and they're set in
these round eyes.

00:50:36.320 --> 00:50:39.600 align:middle line:84%
And it's not quite human, and
you know it's not quite human,

00:50:39.600 --> 00:50:41.920 align:middle line:84%
and you've never seen
anything like it before.

00:50:41.920 --> 00:50:45.460 align:middle line:84%
And then your eyes settle
down from the crystals

00:50:45.460 --> 00:50:48.490 align:middle line:84%
past the nose that
has been whacked off.

00:50:48.490 --> 00:50:52.760 align:middle line:84%
And this is not mouthless
because somebody whacked off

00:50:52.760 --> 00:50:54.119 align:middle line:90%
the mouth, it was built--

00:50:54.119 --> 00:50:54.910 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: No mouth.

00:50:54.910 --> 00:50:57.810 align:middle line:84%
>>MOULTON HOWE: -as a
whole thing of just a chin.

00:50:57.810 --> 00:51:00.210 align:middle line:84%
And what I'm thinking
of, is this meaning

00:51:00.210 --> 00:51:02.350 align:middle line:90%
that it was telepathic?

00:51:02.350 --> 00:51:05.140 align:middle line:84%
And then you come
down into the neck.

00:51:05.140 --> 00:51:09.077 align:middle line:84%
And here are double
Vs exactly like--

00:51:09.077 --> 00:51:09.910 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Star Trek.

00:51:09.910 --> 00:51:11.701 align:middle line:84%
>>MOULTON HOWE: -people
in the abduc-- Star

00:51:11.701 --> 00:51:13.110 align:middle line:90%
Trek and the abduction syndrome.

00:51:13.110 --> 00:51:16.130 align:middle line:84%
35 years I've had
people draw beings

00:51:16.130 --> 00:51:18.560 align:middle line:84%
that they've encountered
with the double V.

00:51:18.560 --> 00:51:21.550 align:middle line:84%
And then you keep dropping
down on this torso,

00:51:21.550 --> 00:51:25.460 align:middle line:84%
and you are coming to a man
who's got five fingers that

00:51:25.460 --> 00:51:28.490 align:middle line:84%
are holding an erect
phallus, the testicles

00:51:28.490 --> 00:51:31.620 align:middle line:84%
are hanging down below
the bottom of the hands.

00:51:31.620 --> 00:51:36.390 align:middle line:84%
And everybody there said, if
the five fingers are holding

00:51:36.390 --> 00:51:41.080 align:middle line:84%
an erect phallus, there must
be a sixth finger behind.

00:51:41.080 --> 00:51:43.200 align:middle line:84%
This is one of the
questions that comes up

00:51:43.200 --> 00:51:47.260 align:middle line:84%
about Gobekli Tepe, six
fingers versus five fingers.

00:51:47.260 --> 00:51:52.100 align:middle line:84%
And Genesis, in the
literature of the Bible,

00:51:52.100 --> 00:51:55.020 align:middle line:84%
talks about giants
who were the product

00:51:55.020 --> 00:51:57.960 align:middle line:84%
of some sort of non-human
or angelic realm

00:51:57.960 --> 00:52:01.127 align:middle line:84%
and human females that had
six fingers and were tall.

00:52:01.127 --> 00:52:03.210 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Let's go back
now to the other sculpture

00:52:03.210 --> 00:52:05.585 align:middle line:84%
for a moment, because one of
the things you discovered on

00:52:05.585 --> 00:52:08.210 align:middle line:84%
that, the face is
kind of obscured,

00:52:08.210 --> 00:52:09.740 align:middle line:84%
but let's talk
about the product.

00:52:09.740 --> 00:52:14.370 align:middle line:84%
>>MOULTON HOWE: This was, to
me, the most astonishing thing

00:52:14.370 --> 00:52:16.450 align:middle line:84%
outside of "Urfa
Man" in the museum.

00:52:16.450 --> 00:52:19.770 align:middle line:84%
And remember, everything
you're looking at,

00:52:19.770 --> 00:52:23.750 align:middle line:84%
everything we're describing
is at least 12,000 years old.

00:52:23.750 --> 00:52:27.600 align:middle line:84%
"Urfa Man" with sculpted
at least 12,000 years ago.

00:52:27.600 --> 00:52:31.050 align:middle line:84%
And I came into the
museum taking photographs

00:52:31.050 --> 00:52:34.757 align:middle line:84%
and came in to the left side
of a stone totem about 6 feet--

00:52:34.757 --> 00:52:36.590 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Which we are
looking at right now.

00:52:36.590 --> 00:52:38.190 align:middle line:90%
>>MOULTON HOWE: -4 inches tall.

00:52:38.190 --> 00:52:41.270 align:middle line:84%
And from the side, it
looked like a creature--

00:52:41.270 --> 00:52:43.920 align:middle line:84%
a definitely non-human
creature's head.

00:52:43.920 --> 00:52:47.990 align:middle line:84%
And then I thought it was a
snake coming down the side.

00:52:47.990 --> 00:52:52.190 align:middle line:84%
And when I moved around to
take the front photograph,

00:52:52.190 --> 00:52:56.480 align:middle line:84%
my shock was that what was
the creature's bizarre head

00:52:56.480 --> 00:53:00.725 align:middle line:84%
to the side, something had
smashed it off like to nose

00:53:00.725 --> 00:53:03.320 align:middle line:84%
had been whacked
off of "Urfa Man."

00:53:03.320 --> 00:53:07.000 align:middle line:84%
And below was another
bizarre creature's head

00:53:07.000 --> 00:53:10.160 align:middle line:84%
with strange eyes and
hands coming around,

00:53:10.160 --> 00:53:13.770 align:middle line:84%
and then I realized
the snakes coming down

00:53:13.770 --> 00:53:19.020 align:middle line:84%
are the arms, knees,
and feet of a pubic area

00:53:19.020 --> 00:53:22.471 align:middle line:84%
that is giving birth to what
looks like a human child.

00:53:22.471 --> 00:53:24.970 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: That little child we
see at the bottom there, yes.

00:53:24.970 --> 00:53:28.420 align:middle line:84%
>>MOULTON HOWE: And I stood
there in a minor state of shock

00:53:28.420 --> 00:53:36.450 align:middle line:84%
because on April 9, 1983,
at Kirtland Air Force

00:53:36.450 --> 00:53:38.820 align:middle line:84%
Base in Albuquerque,
New Mexico, working

00:53:38.820 --> 00:53:45.920 align:middle line:84%
on an HBO hour for television,
I was given a so-called briefing

00:53:45.920 --> 00:53:49.780 align:middle line:84%
paper for the President of
the United States of America.

00:53:49.780 --> 00:53:51.470 align:middle line:90%
I was asked to read it.

00:53:51.470 --> 00:53:54.180 align:middle line:84%
I was told that the AFOSI
agent in front of me

00:53:54.180 --> 00:53:56.850 align:middle line:84%
would answer questions,
but I could take no notes.

00:53:56.850 --> 00:53:59.520 align:middle line:84%
And they directed me to a
chair in the middle of the room

00:53:59.520 --> 00:54:03.470 align:middle line:84%
where I had to sit to read this
alleged presidential briefing

00:54:03.470 --> 00:54:05.200 align:middle line:90%
paper.

00:54:05.200 --> 00:54:09.120 align:middle line:84%
And as I read, I
came to a paragraph

00:54:09.120 --> 00:54:12.020 align:middle line:90%
that is still clear in my mind.

00:54:12.020 --> 00:54:14.560 align:middle line:84%
Extraterrestrial
biological entities

00:54:14.560 --> 00:54:18.670 align:middle line:84%
manipulated DNA in
already evolving primates

00:54:18.670 --> 00:54:22.480 align:middle line:84%
to create Homo sapiens and
the Latin word was used.

00:54:22.480 --> 00:54:25.780 align:middle line:84%
And then another paragraph
under a Project Garnet--

00:54:25.780 --> 00:54:28.850 align:middle line:84%
because I told myself,
remember your birthday--

00:54:28.850 --> 00:54:32.470 align:middle line:84%
Project Garnet, all
questions and mysteries

00:54:32.470 --> 00:54:35.640 align:middle line:84%
about the evolution of
Homo sapien on this planet

00:54:35.640 --> 00:54:38.930 align:middle line:84%
have been answered and
this project is closed.

00:54:38.930 --> 00:54:41.700 align:middle line:84%
And I remember reading
both of these sentences

00:54:41.700 --> 00:54:45.750 align:middle line:84%
over and over as if my mind
went to a tilt, in which

00:54:45.750 --> 00:54:53.880 align:middle line:84%
the implications were racing
with we are-- if we standing up

00:54:53.880 --> 00:54:57.450 align:middle line:84%
primates are made from
genetic manipulation

00:54:57.450 --> 00:54:59.830 align:middle line:84%
by extraterrestrial
biological entities,

00:54:59.830 --> 00:55:03.300 align:middle line:84%
we are, by every definition
of Webster's, somebody

00:55:03.300 --> 00:55:04.345 align:middle line:90%
else's android.

00:55:04.345 --> 00:55:09.170 align:middle line:84%
An android is defined as
a biological smart robot.

00:55:09.170 --> 00:55:13.910 align:middle line:84%
A robot is mechanical;
an android is organic.

00:55:13.910 --> 00:55:17.900 align:middle line:84%
What is our relationship
as Cro-Magnon, Homo sapien,

00:55:17.900 --> 00:55:23.100 align:middle line:84%
Sapien to all of these waves
of other advanced intelligences

00:55:23.100 --> 00:55:26.350 align:middle line:84%
and their technologies
over millennia.

00:55:26.350 --> 00:55:31.260 align:middle line:84%
And I will share with you and
your audience something that

00:55:31.260 --> 00:55:34.950 align:middle line:84%
was told to me in
1999 by a man who

00:55:34.950 --> 00:55:38.990 align:middle line:84%
was retired from the
Defense Intelligence Agency.

00:55:38.990 --> 00:55:43.430 align:middle line:84%
He told me that his job
was to monitor and research

00:55:43.430 --> 00:55:45.990 align:middle line:84%
geopolitical
territorial conflicts

00:55:45.990 --> 00:55:49.660 align:middle line:84%
of extraterrestrial biological
entities on this planet.

00:55:49.660 --> 00:55:54.050 align:middle line:84%
And he said, Linda,
think of modern man

00:55:54.050 --> 00:55:59.214 align:middle line:84%
as the 37th model of a
Hoover vacuum cleaner.

00:55:59.214 --> 00:56:00.880 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And I hear
what you're saying.

00:56:00.880 --> 00:56:03.100 align:middle line:84%
And that other
document you read,

00:56:03.100 --> 00:56:05.720 align:middle line:84%
that you got your hands
on that is amazing,

00:56:05.720 --> 00:56:10.470 align:middle line:84%
as profound as it is, I find
it arrogant in that it may

00:56:10.470 --> 00:56:12.910 align:middle line:84%
be talking about what they
have been able to discover

00:56:12.910 --> 00:56:14.910 align:middle line:84%
to this point, but
to say everything

00:56:14.910 --> 00:56:17.762 align:middle line:84%
is already known that was
then when we don't even

00:56:17.762 --> 00:56:18.470 align:middle line:90%
know the stretch?

00:56:18.470 --> 00:56:21.390 align:middle line:84%
>>MOULTON HOWE: Oh, about
that the project was closed

00:56:21.390 --> 00:56:26.007 align:middle line:84%
because their bottom line is, we
are made by extraterrestrials.

00:56:26.007 --> 00:56:26.590 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:56:26.590 --> 00:56:28.420 align:middle line:84%
>>MOULTON HOWE: But
they're not answering,

00:56:28.420 --> 00:56:32.230 align:middle line:84%
nor do they know who, what,
and why, specifically,

00:56:32.230 --> 00:56:34.620 align:middle line:90%
and what is the big box agenda.

00:56:34.620 --> 00:56:36.990 align:middle line:84%
And that's what you,
I, and a few others

00:56:36.990 --> 00:56:38.082 align:middle line:90%
are trying honestly to--

00:56:38.082 --> 00:56:38.790 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: We are.

00:56:38.790 --> 00:56:39.100 align:middle line:90%
>>MOULTON HOWE: -find out.

00:56:39.100 --> 00:56:40.940 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And it doesn't
take into account

00:56:40.940 --> 00:56:45.430 align:middle line:84%
the whole other realm of what
is this intelligence beyond?

00:56:45.430 --> 00:56:49.555 align:middle line:84%
What is this thing that
seems to follow beyond death?

00:56:49.555 --> 00:56:50.930 align:middle line:84%
>>MOULTON HOWE:
The divine field.

00:56:50.930 --> 00:56:52.096 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: This intelligence.

00:56:52.096 --> 00:56:54.210 align:middle line:84%
This divine field,
the notion of soul.

00:56:54.210 --> 00:56:56.606 align:middle line:84%
We have to have another talk
another time because I still

00:56:56.606 --> 00:56:58.230 align:middle line:84%
feel like we're just
getting warmed up.

00:56:58.230 --> 00:57:00.480 align:middle line:84%
Linda, thank you so much for
taking the time to be here.

00:57:00.480 --> 00:57:01.480 align:middle line:84%
>>MOULTON HOWE: Oh, it's
been fun to be here.

00:57:01.480 --> 00:57:02.190 align:middle line:90%
Thank you.

00:57:02.190 --> 00:57:03.780 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: You are so welcome.

00:57:03.780 --> 00:57:05.970 align:middle line:84%
To learn more about this
phenomenon and many others,

00:57:05.970 --> 00:57:08.510 align:middle line:84%
you can go to earthfiles.com
where Linda has compiled

00:57:08.510 --> 00:57:10.800 align:middle line:84%
a massive library
of case studies

00:57:10.800 --> 00:57:13.830 align:middle line:84%
in really the most credible
way possible, in my opinion.

00:57:13.830 --> 00:57:15.410 align:middle line:84%
In her files,
again which you can

00:57:15.410 --> 00:57:17.356 align:middle line:84%
refer to as the real
"X Files," Linda

00:57:17.356 --> 00:57:18.730 align:middle line:84%
is demonstrating
we're only being

00:57:18.730 --> 00:57:21.325 align:middle line:84%
told a small portion
of our human story.

00:57:21.325 --> 00:57:23.450 align:middle line:84%
For more on that, you might
also enjoy my interview

00:57:23.450 --> 00:57:25.700 align:middle line:84%
with Christopher Dunn, which
we talked about, and also

Lynne Kitei.

00:57:26.800 --> 00:57:29.890 align:middle line:84%
Until next time, thank you for
joining us here on Gaiam TV.
