00:00:20.750 --> 00:00:23.150 align:middle line:10%
>>REGINA MEREDITH: There's a
famous poem by Maya Angelou

00:00:23.150 --> 00:00:24.340 align:middle line:10%
that goes like this.

00:00:24.340 --> 00:00:26.420 align:middle line:10%
"Why does the caged bird sing?"

00:00:26.420 --> 00:00:29.960 align:middle line:10%
I would ask why don't we
caged birds sing any longer?

00:00:29.960 --> 00:00:32.119 align:middle line:84%
Because we've become
modernized and civilized,

00:00:32.119 --> 00:00:35.600 align:middle line:84%
we no longer gather as family
and community and sing.

00:00:35.600 --> 00:00:38.510 align:middle line:84%
But what have we lost along
the way as a result of that?

00:00:38.510 --> 00:00:40.580 align:middle line:84%
Let's ask Jill Purce,
who is with us today

00:00:40.580 --> 00:00:42.710 align:middle line:84%
to speak about the
role of toning, music,

00:00:42.710 --> 00:00:44.250 align:middle line:90%
and chanting in our lives.

00:00:44.250 --> 00:00:46.760 align:middle line:84%
And first of all, you've
already had a really wonderful

00:00:46.760 --> 00:00:48.920 align:middle line:84%
set up by your husband
Rupert Sheldrake, who

00:00:48.920 --> 00:00:52.520 align:middle line:84%
credits a lot to you by his way
of experience and understanding

00:00:52.520 --> 00:00:54.410 align:middle line:90%
with voice and singing.

00:00:54.410 --> 00:00:58.010 align:middle line:84%
And I wanted to start right out
with a wonderful little story

00:00:58.010 --> 00:01:00.860 align:middle line:84%
you told on an interview
that I watched with you that

00:01:00.860 --> 00:01:02.870 align:middle line:84%
had to do when you
were a little girl,

00:01:02.870 --> 00:01:04.069 align:middle line:90%
and you were out on a boat.

00:01:04.069 --> 00:01:07.520 align:middle line:84%
And the sea was stormy, or the
lake, or whatever body of water

00:01:07.520 --> 00:01:08.990 align:middle line:90%
you were on was stormy.

00:01:08.990 --> 00:01:10.790 align:middle line:90%
It's just a beautiful tale.

00:01:10.790 --> 00:01:12.570 align:middle line:84%
Would you please
share that with us?

00:01:12.570 --> 00:01:13.370 align:middle line:90%
And welcome.

00:01:13.370 --> 00:01:14.704 align:middle line:90%
It's wonderful to have you here.

00:01:14.704 --> 00:01:15.703 align:middle line:90%
>>JILL PURCE: Thank you.

00:01:15.703 --> 00:01:16.610 align:middle line:10%
Thank you.

00:01:16.610 --> 00:01:18.320 align:middle line:10%
Well, my father
was very eccentric.

00:01:18.320 --> 00:01:20.390 align:middle line:10%
And when I was a
child, he would lead us

00:01:20.390 --> 00:01:23.690 align:middle line:10%
on expeditions when everybody
else was going to bed.

00:01:23.690 --> 00:01:27.090 align:middle line:84%
And on one occasion, he wanted
to go to this remote island,

00:01:27.090 --> 00:01:29.150 align:middle line:84%
and so we set off
very late at night

00:01:29.150 --> 00:01:31.400 align:middle line:84%
with nobody in the
boat except my brother,

00:01:31.400 --> 00:01:34.220 align:middle line:84%
and my mother and father,
and three old women

00:01:34.220 --> 00:01:36.050 align:middle line:84%
standing at the
back of the boat.

00:01:36.050 --> 00:01:39.980 align:middle line:84%
And as we set off, a storm came
up, and a really violent storm.

00:01:39.980 --> 00:01:43.820 align:middle line:84%
And we all were completely
convinced and terrified that we

00:01:43.820 --> 00:01:45.770 align:middle line:90%
were going to drown.

00:01:45.770 --> 00:01:47.360 align:middle line:84%
And then, all of a
sudden, these women

00:01:47.360 --> 00:01:51.920 align:middle line:84%
started a wailing, crying
chant at the back of the boat.

00:01:51.920 --> 00:01:56.870 align:middle line:84%
And with that chant, our
terror turned to ecstasy.

00:01:56.870 --> 00:02:00.260 align:middle line:84%
Our fear that we would
drown became a kind

00:02:00.260 --> 00:02:02.780 align:middle line:84%
of blissfulness in
the exact moment

00:02:02.780 --> 00:02:04.640 align:middle line:90%
that they started chanting.

00:02:04.640 --> 00:02:10.730 align:middle line:84%
And then, the wind subsided, the
waves calmed, and we arrived.

00:02:10.730 --> 00:02:13.100 align:middle line:84%
And so this in my
experience, this

00:02:13.100 --> 00:02:17.180 align:middle line:84%
was my first transmission of
the power of sound as something

00:02:17.180 --> 00:02:21.650 align:middle line:84%
which transforms not just our
emotions, but the very elements

00:02:21.650 --> 00:02:23.380 align:middle line:90%
themselves.

00:02:23.380 --> 00:02:26.030 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: You know,
as you're saying that,

00:02:26.030 --> 00:02:29.120 align:middle line:84%
what I was going through
my head is that you were

00:02:29.120 --> 00:02:33.800 align:middle line:84%
in a state of trauma, in that
momentary kind of frozen state

00:02:33.800 --> 00:02:36.680 align:middle line:84%
of trauma when you all
thought you were going to die.

00:02:36.680 --> 00:02:39.620 align:middle line:84%
And it's always said that trauma
is the time where the being is

00:02:39.620 --> 00:02:43.430 align:middle line:84%
most susceptible and most open
to any kind of suggestion,

00:02:43.430 --> 00:02:46.400 align:middle line:84%
like in the world of
hypnotherapy for example.

00:02:46.400 --> 00:02:49.910 align:middle line:84%
But that brings the
question of, how

00:02:49.910 --> 00:02:53.660 align:middle line:84%
might sound be used when
trauma is occurring in life?

00:02:53.660 --> 00:02:56.960 align:middle line:84%
How might it have been
used in the past in tribes,

00:02:56.960 --> 00:02:59.120 align:middle line:84%
for example, in
indigenous tribes when

00:02:59.120 --> 00:03:02.450 align:middle line:84%
there was a trauma to
the tribe or the family?

00:03:02.450 --> 00:03:04.400 align:middle line:84%
>>PURCE: Well sound
has many functions

00:03:04.400 --> 00:03:09.850 align:middle line:84%
and it originally sound
was used to maintain life

00:03:09.850 --> 00:03:12.950 align:middle line:84%
so people chanted
literally to stay alive

00:03:12.950 --> 00:03:16.790 align:middle line:84%
because in traditional
cultures you only stayed alive

00:03:16.790 --> 00:03:20.660 align:middle line:84%
if you had a good relationship
with the divine or the God

00:03:20.660 --> 00:03:25.340 align:middle line:84%
or that's the great spirit or
whoever you felt was in charge

00:03:25.340 --> 00:03:27.110 align:middle line:90%
of our life and destiny.

00:03:27.110 --> 00:03:29.870 align:middle line:84%
And so by chanting,
and praising,

00:03:29.870 --> 00:03:35.090 align:middle line:84%
praising this great divine
being, you were doing what--

00:03:35.090 --> 00:03:40.370 align:middle line:84%
I call these the 3 Ps, so
praising first, and then when

00:03:40.370 --> 00:03:43.010 align:middle line:84%
you've praised and thanked,
then petitioning, asking

00:03:43.010 --> 00:03:46.340 align:middle line:84%
for help, and then on a
more sophisticated level,

00:03:46.340 --> 00:03:50.300 align:middle line:84%
participating. so praising,
petitioning, and participating,

00:03:50.300 --> 00:03:52.700 align:middle line:84%
which means
integrating completely

00:03:52.700 --> 00:03:54.860 align:middle line:84%
through sound with
a divine being

00:03:54.860 --> 00:03:57.800 align:middle line:84%
or with the spiritual
dimension itself.

00:03:57.800 --> 00:04:04.470 align:middle line:84%
So sound is used and has always
been used to maintain life

00:04:04.470 --> 00:04:05.270 align:middle line:90%
itself.

00:04:05.270 --> 00:04:09.290 align:middle line:84%
And then, as we
continued, gradually, we

00:04:09.290 --> 00:04:12.410 align:middle line:84%
thought we could
maintain life by seeing

00:04:12.410 --> 00:04:14.000 align:middle line:84%
what happened
yesterday, by trying

00:04:14.000 --> 00:04:15.714 align:middle line:84%
to predict what would
happen tomorrow,

00:04:15.714 --> 00:04:17.089 align:middle line:84%
based on what
happened yesterday.

00:04:17.089 --> 00:04:20.269 align:middle line:84%
And in order to do
that, you have to kill,

00:04:20.269 --> 00:04:23.180 align:middle line:84%
you have to grind up,
and measure, and then

00:04:23.180 --> 00:04:28.250 align:middle line:84%
count in order to
try to establish

00:04:28.250 --> 00:04:31.130 align:middle line:84%
if it's going to measure
and count the same tomorrow.

00:04:31.130 --> 00:04:35.490 align:middle line:84%
So in traditional cultures,
the world is alive,

00:04:35.490 --> 00:04:37.430 align:middle line:84%
and so we have a
living relationship

00:04:37.430 --> 00:04:40.670 align:middle line:90%
with that through sound itself.

00:04:40.670 --> 00:04:43.610 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And really,
what you were just

00:04:43.610 --> 00:04:47.570 align:middle line:84%
saying about becoming concerned
about projecting from the past

00:04:47.570 --> 00:04:49.580 align:middle line:84%
into the future,
projecting, and predicting,

00:04:49.580 --> 00:04:52.500 align:middle line:84%
and so forth, it takes us
out of the now as well.

00:04:52.500 --> 00:04:54.410 align:middle line:84%
And the one thing
about singing is

00:04:54.410 --> 00:04:58.340 align:middle line:84%
it's a vibrational
transmission of the now.

00:04:58.340 --> 00:04:59.870 align:middle line:90%
And let's talk about--

00:04:59.870 --> 00:05:02.150 align:middle line:84%
we have mostly
lost our connection

00:05:02.150 --> 00:05:05.630 align:middle line:84%
with the now, which is I
guess why Eckhart Tolle's

00:05:05.630 --> 00:05:08.180 align:middle line:84%
book, The Power of Now, was
such a hit is because everybody

00:05:08.180 --> 00:05:09.882 align:middle line:90%
forgot how to be here now.

00:05:09.882 --> 00:05:11.840 align:middle line:84%
>>PURCE: So that's really
the essence of sound.

00:05:11.840 --> 00:05:16.670 align:middle line:84%
I mean, the essence of
sound is that you could only

00:05:16.670 --> 00:05:18.490 align:middle line:90%
chant in the present.

00:05:18.490 --> 00:05:19.750 align:middle line:90%
You can't chant in the past.

00:05:19.750 --> 00:05:21.490 align:middle line:90%
You can't chant in the future.

00:05:21.490 --> 00:05:24.640 align:middle line:84%
So as long as you're chanting
in the present, if you,

00:05:24.640 --> 00:05:27.070 align:middle line:84%
at the same time, as
chanting the present,

00:05:27.070 --> 00:05:30.080 align:middle line:84%
you are listening to yourself
chanting in the present.

00:05:30.080 --> 00:05:31.840 align:middle line:84%
Then, you create a
circuit of tension.

00:05:31.840 --> 00:05:33.370 align:middle line:84%
So you're chanting
in the present,

00:05:33.370 --> 00:05:34.500 align:middle line:84%
and you're listening
to the chant

00:05:34.500 --> 00:05:36.083 align:middle line:84%
that you are chanting
at the same time

00:05:36.083 --> 00:05:37.330 align:middle line:90%
as you're chanting it.

00:05:37.330 --> 00:05:40.600 align:middle line:84%
So you're maintaining yourself
in the present moment,

00:05:40.600 --> 00:05:45.770 align:middle line:84%
and that's one of the key
qualities, the gifts of sound,

00:05:45.770 --> 00:05:49.330 align:middle line:84%
which is that, unlike
mindfulness, where you're

00:05:49.330 --> 00:05:51.550 align:middle line:84%
attending to what's
happening around you,

00:05:51.550 --> 00:05:54.160 align:middle line:84%
you're actually doing the thing
that you're being mindful of.

00:05:54.160 --> 00:05:57.110 align:middle line:84%
So this circuit of
attention is absolutely key.

00:05:57.110 --> 00:05:58.750 align:middle line:90%
And so you are in the present.

00:05:58.750 --> 00:06:01.660 align:middle line:84%
So normally, we spend
most of our time

00:06:01.660 --> 00:06:04.690 align:middle line:84%
naming that which is other
than us, as separate from us,

00:06:04.690 --> 00:06:05.530 align:middle line:90%
so giving names.

00:06:05.530 --> 00:06:09.970 align:middle line:84%
So from an early childhood, the
more names we have for things--

00:06:09.970 --> 00:06:13.510 align:middle line:84%
we sit on our parents' knee
who points out images and say

00:06:13.510 --> 00:06:15.250 align:middle line:90%
cows, sheep, dog.

00:06:15.250 --> 00:06:17.320 align:middle line:84%
And then, the more names
we have for things,

00:06:17.320 --> 00:06:20.470 align:middle line:84%
the more articulate we
think that we become,

00:06:20.470 --> 00:06:23.500 align:middle line:84%
the more separate we become
from that which is not us,

00:06:23.500 --> 00:06:25.630 align:middle line:84%
the greater our
language, the better

00:06:25.630 --> 00:06:28.930 align:middle line:84%
degrees we get at university,
the better colleges we go to.

00:06:28.930 --> 00:06:32.020 align:middle line:84%
But there's more that's
outside of us, which is not us.

00:06:32.020 --> 00:06:34.480 align:middle line:84%
There's more definition,
more separation.

00:06:34.480 --> 00:06:38.180 align:middle line:84%
The ego is more defined, more
separate, more articulated.

00:06:38.180 --> 00:06:40.030 align:middle line:90%
And so there's more to overcome.

00:06:40.030 --> 00:06:46.030 align:middle line:84%
So most spiritual
practices involve

00:06:46.030 --> 00:06:48.440 align:middle line:90%
using these doors of perception.

00:06:48.440 --> 00:06:52.600 align:middle line:84%
So, for example, you know,
using names to go beyond names.

00:06:52.600 --> 00:06:56.830 align:middle line:84%
So if I say tree, then going
to the essence of treeness.

00:06:56.830 --> 00:07:04.480 align:middle line:84%
So sound allows us to overcome
this state of separation, which

00:07:04.480 --> 00:07:07.810 align:middle line:84%
means that we're usually in
a state of regressing what we

00:07:07.810 --> 00:07:11.080 align:middle line:84%
forgot to do in the past
and writing what we will,

00:07:11.080 --> 00:07:12.910 align:middle line:84%
therefore, have to do
in the future, which

00:07:12.910 --> 00:07:14.710 align:middle line:90%
means we are isolated.

00:07:14.710 --> 00:07:18.430 align:middle line:84%
We're in a kind of
separated from this time

00:07:18.430 --> 00:07:22.636 align:middle line:84%
line, which has no existence
except it's a delusional.

00:07:22.636 --> 00:07:24.010 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: It's
just a perception.

00:07:24.010 --> 00:07:25.390 align:middle line:90%
Right, an illusion.

00:07:25.390 --> 00:07:28.030 align:middle line:84%
>>PURCE: And so the
essence of sound

00:07:28.030 --> 00:07:31.860 align:middle line:84%
is it allows us to overcome
these regrets of the past,

00:07:31.860 --> 00:07:34.660 align:middle line:84%
these dreads of the future,
to be in the present,

00:07:34.660 --> 00:07:37.510 align:middle line:84%
continuously in the present,
for as long as we listen

00:07:37.510 --> 00:07:39.230 align:middle line:90%
to the sound that we're making.

00:07:39.230 --> 00:07:43.090 align:middle line:84%
And so the key is not to forget
to listen or to remember when

00:07:43.090 --> 00:07:44.980 align:middle line:84%
we have forgotten,
which is difficult

00:07:44.980 --> 00:07:46.430 align:middle line:90%
because we have forgotten.

00:07:46.430 --> 00:07:47.230 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:07:47.230 --> 00:07:50.200 align:middle line:84%
You bring up a few key points
that I'm going to take off on,

00:07:50.200 --> 00:07:51.540 align:middle line:90%
riff on a little bit with you.

00:07:51.540 --> 00:07:53.450 align:middle line:84%
And one of them
is the notion of--

00:07:53.450 --> 00:07:56.500 align:middle line:84%
as you say, people used
to sing to stay alive.

00:07:56.500 --> 00:08:00.760 align:middle line:84%
And we think of the
only fuel that we

00:08:00.760 --> 00:08:04.060 align:middle line:84%
need to stay alive is
things like food, water,

00:08:04.060 --> 00:08:05.377 align:middle line:90%
and supplements.

00:08:05.377 --> 00:08:07.210 align:middle line:84%
Some people would say
wine and other things,

00:08:07.210 --> 00:08:10.360 align:middle line:84%
but the point is we think
that's what keeps us alive

00:08:10.360 --> 00:08:15.130 align:middle line:84%
when we have forgotten that
everything is frequency based.

00:08:15.130 --> 00:08:16.960 align:middle line:84%
And those things are
maybe the densest

00:08:16.960 --> 00:08:19.450 align:middle line:90%
of all frequencies we take in.

00:08:19.450 --> 00:08:23.260 align:middle line:84%
And then we ignore
incredible frequency sources,

00:08:23.260 --> 00:08:25.900 align:middle line:90%
such as sound in our own voice.

00:08:25.900 --> 00:08:28.690 align:middle line:84%
Can you talk about that
really more on a nutrient

00:08:28.690 --> 00:08:31.960 align:middle line:84%
level for not just
the soul but the body?

00:08:31.960 --> 00:08:34.740 align:middle line:84%
>>PURCE: Well the world that
we live in is a vibratory one,

00:08:34.740 --> 00:08:39.460 align:middle line:84%
so everything is regularity
and periodicities of movement.

00:08:39.460 --> 00:08:41.799 align:middle line:84%
And the way that we can
participate in that-- so going

00:08:41.799 --> 00:08:46.790 align:middle line:84%
back to my 3 Ps, my
praise, petition, and then

00:08:46.790 --> 00:08:49.180 align:middle line:84%
participation, the
way we can participate

00:08:49.180 --> 00:08:51.797 align:middle line:84%
in the vibratory nature of
things is by bracing ourselves.

00:08:51.797 --> 00:08:53.380 align:middle line:84%
And the way that we
have of doing that

00:08:53.380 --> 00:08:55.060 align:middle line:90%
is through our voices.

00:08:55.060 --> 00:08:58.700 align:middle line:84%
And I often sort
of tease people.

00:08:58.700 --> 00:09:01.270 align:middle line:84%
I was once on a plane
with a whole orchestra

00:09:01.270 --> 00:09:03.290 align:middle line:84%
again between
Boston and New York.

00:09:03.290 --> 00:09:05.380 align:middle line:84%
And when we came to
the baggage pick up,

00:09:05.380 --> 00:09:07.660 align:middle line:84%
there was a woman laboring
under her double bass.

00:09:07.660 --> 00:09:11.787 align:middle line:84%
So I couldn't help whispering
in her ear, you should sing.

00:09:11.787 --> 00:09:13.870 align:middle line:84%
Because you don't need an
extra seat on the plane.

00:09:13.870 --> 00:09:17.140 align:middle line:84%
We carry our voices around
all the time, and our voices--

00:09:17.140 --> 00:09:19.380 align:middle line:84%
the way that we
integrate with the world

00:09:19.380 --> 00:09:21.740 align:middle line:84%
is the way that we
flow with the world.

00:09:21.740 --> 00:09:24.130 align:middle line:84%
It's the way that we become
present with the world,

00:09:24.130 --> 00:09:27.446 align:middle line:84%
and it's interesting to look
at why we stopped chanting.

00:09:27.446 --> 00:09:29.320 align:middle line:84%
And this is one of the
things that's always--

00:09:29.320 --> 00:09:30.880 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: That's
my next question.

00:09:30.880 --> 00:09:31.710 align:middle line:90%
Why did we stop?

00:09:31.710 --> 00:09:33.460 align:middle line:84%
Well, I have one
more before that.

00:09:33.460 --> 00:09:35.350 align:middle line:84%
So when you're in
the moment, when

00:09:35.350 --> 00:09:39.250 align:middle line:84%
you're putting these
sounds out, does this

00:09:39.250 --> 00:09:43.240 align:middle line:84%
remove us from, or
bypass, egoic function?

00:09:43.240 --> 00:09:45.370 align:middle line:84%
Because so much of
our self-perception

00:09:45.370 --> 00:09:49.100 align:middle line:84%
is just tied up in the egoic
perception of what we are.

00:09:49.100 --> 00:09:51.370 align:middle line:84%
And I mean kind of the
bastardized use of the word

00:09:51.370 --> 00:09:53.680 align:middle line:90%
ego, not the pure word.

00:09:53.680 --> 00:09:55.730 align:middle line:84%
>>PURCE: Well, you
know, we have--

00:09:55.730 --> 00:10:00.100 align:middle line:84%
so if I see you as
separate from me,

00:10:00.100 --> 00:10:06.640 align:middle line:84%
then that leads me
to two next impulses.

00:10:06.640 --> 00:10:09.740 align:middle line:84%
One is, I like you,
and I want you.

00:10:09.740 --> 00:10:11.530 align:middle line:90%
And I cannot have enough of you.

00:10:11.530 --> 00:10:14.920 align:middle line:84%
So I'm in a state of
desire and of attachment.

00:10:14.920 --> 00:10:18.100 align:middle line:84%
Or if I see you
separate from me,

00:10:18.100 --> 00:10:21.480 align:middle line:84%
and I find I'm lumbered with
you, but I don't want you,

00:10:21.480 --> 00:10:23.710 align:middle line:84%
then that leads to
anger, resentment,

00:10:23.710 --> 00:10:25.480 align:middle line:90%
and pushing you away.

00:10:25.480 --> 00:10:29.010 align:middle line:84%
So in Tibetan Buddhism,
these desire and attachment,

00:10:29.010 --> 00:10:34.450 align:middle line:84%
or anger, and resentment, and
aversion to primary impulses,

00:10:34.450 --> 00:10:36.310 align:middle line:84%
which are all
based on ignorance.

00:10:36.310 --> 00:10:38.950 align:middle line:84%
And ignorance is
ignoring what is,

00:10:38.950 --> 00:10:43.930 align:middle line:84%
which is there is no separation,
but we ignore it even though we

00:10:43.930 --> 00:10:46.110 align:middle line:84%
know-- so there's an
element of blame--

00:10:46.110 --> 00:10:47.600 align:middle line:90%
that there is no separation.

00:10:47.600 --> 00:10:51.857 align:middle line:84%
And these are a fundamental
basis on which we exist.

00:10:51.857 --> 00:10:54.190 align:middle line:84%
These are known in Tibetan
Buddhism as the three poisons

00:10:54.190 --> 00:10:58.120 align:middle line:84%
and are the cause of all
sickness, of all separation,

00:10:58.120 --> 00:11:01.720 align:middle line:84%
of all our problems, of our
delusions of separation.

00:11:01.720 --> 00:11:06.290 align:middle line:84%
And so sound that allows us
to overcome the separation

00:11:06.290 --> 00:11:08.680 align:middle line:90%
so that there is no--

00:11:08.680 --> 00:11:12.170 align:middle line:84%
we're able to integrate
in such a way that,

00:11:12.170 --> 00:11:14.560 align:middle line:84%
for the duration of the
sound, and while we're

00:11:14.560 --> 00:11:17.230 align:middle line:84%
listening to it,
there is no separation

00:11:17.230 --> 00:11:19.800 align:middle line:84%
because sound is
very interesting.

00:11:19.800 --> 00:11:21.230 align:middle line:90%
Sound creates form.

00:11:21.230 --> 00:11:24.110 align:middle line:84%
So every form has its
own sounds, you know.

00:11:24.110 --> 00:11:27.580 align:middle line:84%
We know this from winding our
finger around a wine glass,

00:11:27.580 --> 00:11:29.360 align:middle line:84%
and then the wine
glass sings it's note.

00:11:29.360 --> 00:11:30.160 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:11:30.160 --> 00:11:31.990 align:middle line:10%
In somatics, where
you can watch sound

00:11:31.990 --> 00:11:35.419 align:middle line:10%
create vibrational patterns in
the sand, geometric patterns.

00:11:35.419 --> 00:11:37.210 align:middle line:10%
>>PURCE: Well, this
was what started me off

00:11:37.210 --> 00:11:39.070 align:middle line:10%
in my work with sand,
but I come back to that.

00:11:39.070 --> 00:11:39.870 align:middle line:10%
>>REGINA: OK.

00:11:39.870 --> 00:11:42.280 align:middle line:84%
>>PURCE: So with the wine
glass, if you wet a finger

00:11:42.280 --> 00:11:44.440 align:middle line:84%
and wind it around, the
wine glass sings its note.

00:11:44.440 --> 00:11:44.890 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:11:44.890 --> 00:11:46.598 align:middle line:84%
>>PURCE: And that's
the note you can then

00:11:46.598 --> 00:11:49.060 align:middle line:84%
direct back at the wine
glass in order to shatter it.

00:11:49.060 --> 00:11:52.020 align:middle line:84%
So the sound of a thing is the
key to its own dissolution.

00:11:52.020 --> 00:11:53.020 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Wait a minute.

00:11:53.020 --> 00:11:55.750 align:middle line:84%
So you're saying if we're
ringing our wine glass,

00:11:55.750 --> 00:11:58.300 align:middle line:84%
OK, if it's ringing,
if we tone that

00:11:58.300 --> 00:12:01.000 align:middle line:84%
back to it, that
same tone, is that

00:12:01.000 --> 00:12:02.125 align:middle line:90%
what causes the shattering?

00:12:02.125 --> 00:12:03.310 align:middle line:90%
>>PURCE: So that could--

00:12:03.310 --> 00:12:07.464 align:middle line:84%
well, that, but you
slightly, come slightly above

00:12:07.464 --> 00:12:09.130 align:middle line:84%
and slightly below
because the intervals

00:12:09.130 --> 00:12:11.500 align:middle line:84%
slightly above
and slightly below

00:12:11.500 --> 00:12:13.380 align:middle line:90%
are the most disharmonious.

00:12:13.380 --> 00:12:15.940 align:middle line:84%
And so you do what has
been called worrying it.

00:12:15.940 --> 00:12:19.870 align:middle line:10%
So in the early '70s, I
was living and working

00:12:19.870 --> 00:12:22.990 align:middle line:10%
with a German composer,
Karlheinz Stockhausen,

00:12:22.990 --> 00:12:24.940 align:middle line:10%
and one of the pieces
that we worked on

00:12:24.940 --> 00:12:27.370 align:middle line:10%
was called Alphabet
for Liege, which

00:12:27.370 --> 00:12:31.040 align:middle line:10%
had been commissioned by the
city of Liege in Belgium.

00:12:31.040 --> 00:12:35.590 align:middle line:84%
And so what we did was we had 13
different installations showing

00:12:35.590 --> 00:12:37.970 align:middle line:90%
the effect of sound on matter.

00:12:37.970 --> 00:12:41.970 align:middle line:84%
And one of these, an old
assistants of Stockhausen,

00:12:41.970 --> 00:12:46.300 align:middle line:84%
Hugh Davis, got these
very large sheets of glass

00:12:46.300 --> 00:12:47.110 align:middle line:90%
with holes in them.

00:12:47.110 --> 00:12:49.030 align:middle line:84%
And then he had what he
called a siren, which

00:12:49.030 --> 00:12:52.870 align:middle line:84%
is an electronic instrument
for electronically changing

00:12:52.870 --> 00:12:54.080 align:middle line:90%
the pitch continuously.

00:12:54.080 --> 00:12:57.951 align:middle line:84%
[MIMICKING SIREN] And
then, so he'd get this,

00:12:57.951 --> 00:12:59.700 align:middle line:84%
and it had this little
of bolt on the end.

00:12:59.700 --> 00:13:01.370 align:middle line:84%
And then he'd take
these big sheets.

00:13:01.370 --> 00:13:03.350 align:middle line:84%
Meanwhile, the audience
was perambulatory.

00:13:03.350 --> 00:13:06.500 align:middle line:84%
It was in an old, in a half
built television studio.

00:13:06.500 --> 00:13:10.790 align:middle line:84%
So the audience was going from
installation to installation.

00:13:10.790 --> 00:13:12.410 align:middle line:84%
So people would
come, and then he'd

00:13:12.410 --> 00:13:14.090 align:middle line:84%
take these very large
sheets of glass,

00:13:14.090 --> 00:13:17.070 align:middle line:84%
and he'd bolt them
on to the siren.

00:13:17.070 --> 00:13:19.940 align:middle line:90%
And then he'd turn up the sound.

00:13:19.940 --> 00:13:23.060 align:middle line:84%
[MIMICKING SIREN] And then,
he poured water on the glass.

00:13:23.060 --> 00:13:24.980 align:middle line:84%
And then, as soon as
he got to the harmonics

00:13:24.980 --> 00:13:27.050 align:middle line:84%
of the pitch of
the glass itself,

00:13:27.050 --> 00:13:29.120 align:middle line:84%
the vibrations, such as
you were talking about,

00:13:29.120 --> 00:13:33.176 align:middle line:84%
the cymatics, the pattern, these
vibratory patterns, would show.

00:13:33.176 --> 00:13:35.300 align:middle line:84%
And then he'd know what
the pitch of the glass was.

00:13:35.300 --> 00:13:37.175 align:middle line:84%
And then, he'd get to
the pitch of the glass,

00:13:37.175 --> 00:13:38.834 align:middle line:84%
and he'd do what he
called worrying it,

00:13:38.834 --> 00:13:41.000 align:middle line:84%
where you're just slightly
above and below the pitch

00:13:41.000 --> 00:13:41.930 align:middle line:90%
of the glass.

00:13:41.930 --> 00:13:43.506 align:middle line:90%
[HUMMING PITCH]

00:13:43.506 --> 00:13:44.880 align:middle line:84%
Meanwhile, the
audience was calm.

00:13:44.880 --> 00:13:45.963 align:middle line:90%
It was holding the breath.

00:13:45.963 --> 00:13:47.740 align:middle line:90%
And suddenly, it would shatter.

00:13:47.740 --> 00:13:48.540 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Really?

00:13:48.540 --> 00:13:50.790 align:middle line:84%
>>PURCE: But the only problem
with wine glasses is you

00:13:50.790 --> 00:13:52.790 align:middle line:84%
have to have very good
quality wine glasses,

00:13:52.790 --> 00:13:54.070 align:middle line:90%
crystal wine glasses.

00:13:54.070 --> 00:13:57.364 align:middle line:84%

most people have neither.

>>REGINA: Interesting.

00:13:58.280 --> 00:13:59.090 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:13:59.090 --> 00:14:01.490 align:middle line:84%
And so I assume
your wine glass is

00:14:01.490 --> 00:14:04.310 align:middle line:84%
going to sing both major
and minor tones only

00:14:04.310 --> 00:14:05.390 align:middle line:90%
on the amount of water?

00:14:05.390 --> 00:14:06.670 align:middle line:90%
Let's talk about it.

00:14:06.670 --> 00:14:08.210 align:middle line:90%
I love ringing wine glasses.

00:14:08.210 --> 00:14:09.770 align:middle line:84%
>>PURCE: You can
make them depending

00:14:09.770 --> 00:14:11.686 align:middle line:84%
on the amount of water
or the kind wine glass,

00:14:11.686 --> 00:14:12.960 align:middle line:90%
you can have any tone.

00:14:12.960 --> 00:14:16.740 align:middle line:84%
It's just a way of showing that
every form has its own sound.

00:14:16.740 --> 00:14:20.540 align:middle line:84%
So the gift of sound is that
every form has its own sound,

00:14:20.540 --> 00:14:22.550 align:middle line:90%
but it also dissolves sound.

00:14:22.550 --> 00:14:25.790 align:middle line:84%
So one of the gifts of sound is
that it dissolves boundaries.

00:14:25.790 --> 00:14:27.980 align:middle line:90%
It dissolves limitations.

00:14:27.980 --> 00:14:30.900 align:middle line:84%
So it dissolves the
boundaries between you and me.

00:14:30.900 --> 00:14:33.510 align:middle line:84%
It dissolves the boundaries
between matter and spirit.

00:14:33.510 --> 00:14:37.160 align:middle line:84%
It dissolves the boundaries
between this and between that.

00:14:37.160 --> 00:14:42.520 align:middle line:84%
And so it allows for

00:14:42.520 --> 00:14:45.630 align:middle line:84%
community is one of the things
that is not happening anymore.

00:14:45.630 --> 00:14:49.400 align:middle line:84%
And so the way that communities
were created and sustained

00:14:49.400 --> 00:14:51.680 align:middle line:84%
in the past was
through chanting.

00:14:51.680 --> 00:14:54.680 align:middle line:84%
So if you make sounds together,
you dissolve the boundaries

00:14:54.680 --> 00:14:57.710 align:middle line:84%
between each one of
you, each one of us.

00:14:57.710 --> 00:15:00.290 align:middle line:84%
If you're chanting together,
you dissolve the boundaries

00:15:00.290 --> 00:15:02.320 align:middle line:84%
between nature, between
the outside world

00:15:02.320 --> 00:15:07.400 align:middle line:84%
and the inside world so that you
are able to overcome separation

00:15:07.400 --> 00:15:08.960 align:middle line:90%
in every way.

00:15:08.960 --> 00:15:12.530 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: This practice,
it's not an agenda

00:15:12.530 --> 00:15:13.460 align:middle line:90%
that it was destroyed.

00:15:13.460 --> 00:15:15.800 align:middle line:84%
We kind of lost our way
in terms of community

00:15:15.800 --> 00:15:17.660 align:middle line:90%
on a number of levels.

00:15:17.660 --> 00:15:20.420 align:middle line:84%
Certainly, with the
advent of moving away

00:15:20.420 --> 00:15:24.560 align:middle line:84%
from villages and such into
suburbs, for example, where

00:15:24.560 --> 00:15:28.010 align:middle line:84%
families became more separate
from one another and fractured,

00:15:28.010 --> 00:15:30.260 align:middle line:84%
this was just a
practical extension of it

00:15:30.260 --> 00:15:32.010 align:middle line:84%
that we lost our
little communities,

00:15:32.010 --> 00:15:35.250 align:middle line:84%
whether we sang together, and
wherever we sang together,

00:15:35.250 --> 00:15:37.730 align:middle line:84%
whether it was in church
or within a social group

00:15:37.730 --> 00:15:39.350 align:middle line:90%
of some kind.

00:15:39.350 --> 00:15:42.710 align:middle line:84%
How do you look at how we
lost our way in singing?

00:15:42.710 --> 00:15:46.880 align:middle line:84%
That's why I said, we're now the
caged birds, and we don't sing.

00:15:46.880 --> 00:15:49.640 align:middle line:84%
>>PURCE: Well, there are
many reasons for that.

00:15:49.640 --> 00:15:52.250 align:middle line:84%
One reason interestingly
is the development

00:15:52.250 --> 00:15:56.210 align:middle line:84%
of musical notation, which began
in around the eighth century.

00:15:56.210 --> 00:16:00.620 align:middle line:84%
So once you can
notate music, then you

00:16:00.620 --> 00:16:03.620 align:middle line:84%
can use all the
parameters of sound

00:16:03.620 --> 00:16:06.440 align:middle line:84%
and permutate them in
really complex ways.

00:16:06.440 --> 00:16:08.990 align:middle line:84%
And then you can repeat
the music that was created.

00:16:08.990 --> 00:16:13.454 align:middle line:84%
So interestingly, this
is called to execute.

00:16:13.454 --> 00:16:14.495 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Oh interesting.

00:16:14.495 --> 00:16:18.865 align:middle line:84%
>>PURCE: Professional musicians
are called executing--

00:16:18.865 --> 00:16:20.310 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: The notes.

00:16:20.310 --> 00:16:21.110 align:middle line:90%
>>PURCE: Exactly.

00:16:21.110 --> 00:16:24.950 align:middle line:84%
Executing the very thing that
they are trying to recreate.

00:16:24.950 --> 00:16:29.062 align:middle line:84%
So musical notation meant that
it was only available to those

00:16:29.062 --> 00:16:30.770 align:middle line:84%
who could read music,
and this has always

00:16:30.770 --> 00:16:35.270 align:middle line:84%
been a fairly sort of
limited group of people--

00:16:35.270 --> 00:16:36.470 align:middle line:90%
professionals.

00:16:36.470 --> 00:16:38.510 align:middle line:84%
And the interesting
thing about professionals

00:16:38.510 --> 00:16:40.220 align:middle line:84%
is the opposite of
professionals is

00:16:40.220 --> 00:16:42.860 align:middle line:84%
to be an amateur,
which means literally

00:16:42.860 --> 00:16:44.570 align:middle line:90%
in Latin to love something.

00:16:44.570 --> 00:16:47.420 align:middle line:90%
Amour means to love.

00:16:47.420 --> 00:16:50.480 align:middle line:84%
So by definition,
amateurs love something.

00:16:50.480 --> 00:16:53.330 align:middle line:84%
And the inference, of
course, is that professionals

00:16:53.330 --> 00:16:55.700 align:middle line:84%
don't love something,
and that's, sometimes,

00:16:55.700 --> 00:16:57.230 align:middle line:90%
in the music the case.

00:16:57.230 --> 00:17:01.160 align:middle line:84%
So one of the ways that we
stopped using our voices

00:17:01.160 --> 00:17:03.500 align:middle line:84%
was through this
hijacking of sacred music

00:17:03.500 --> 00:17:05.630 align:middle line:90%
by the professionals.

00:17:05.630 --> 00:17:10.069 align:middle line:84%
And then the loss of
communities and the loss

00:17:10.069 --> 00:17:13.300 align:middle line:90%
of spiritual traditions.

00:17:13.300 --> 00:17:16.310 align:middle line:84%
So in the Christian
tradition, for example, people

00:17:16.310 --> 00:17:18.020 align:middle line:84%
would come together
at the same time

00:17:18.020 --> 00:17:20.760 align:middle line:84%
of the year, the
same time of the day,

00:17:20.760 --> 00:17:24.500 align:middle line:84%
using traditionally Latin,
to have the same language.

00:17:24.500 --> 00:17:28.190 align:middle line:84%
And all over the Christian
world, or Christendom, people

00:17:28.190 --> 00:17:31.130 align:middle line:84%
would be chanting the same
time, the same kind of thing,

00:17:31.130 --> 00:17:33.440 align:middle line:84%
which was a huge kind of
resonance that was happening,

00:17:33.440 --> 00:17:35.690 align:middle line:84%
and the same, of
course, is in Islam,

00:17:35.690 --> 00:17:39.770 align:middle line:84%
and the same is in most
spiritual traditions.

00:17:39.770 --> 00:17:42.500 align:middle line:84%
You have these
communities of chant

00:17:42.500 --> 00:17:46.100 align:middle line:84%
that harness the same times of
the year, the same festivals,

00:17:46.100 --> 00:17:49.340 align:middle line:84%
the same holy days, the
same times of the day.

00:17:49.340 --> 00:17:51.230 align:middle line:84%
In the Christian
tradition, the five hours

00:17:51.230 --> 00:17:54.380 align:middle line:84%
that the monks would, or
the nuns, would chant.

00:17:54.380 --> 00:17:57.570 align:middle line:84%
You know, the turning points,
which through chanting

00:17:57.570 --> 00:18:01.380 align:middle line:84%
enables you to go through
the slightly dodgy moments.

00:18:01.380 --> 00:18:05.550 align:middle line:84%
So chant was used to sustain
us through dangerous times.

00:18:05.550 --> 00:18:07.230 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Yes, and
so it would also

00:18:07.230 --> 00:18:08.610 align:middle line:84%
keep you in tune
with one another

00:18:08.610 --> 00:18:10.609 align:middle line:84%
as you were saying earlier,
a type of resonance,

00:18:10.609 --> 00:18:15.000 align:middle line:84%
a kind of psycho-spiritual
resonance within a community,

00:18:15.000 --> 00:18:19.170 align:middle line:84%
a tribe, a township,
a church, or whatnot.

00:18:19.170 --> 00:18:22.620 align:middle line:84%
There was a baseline
understanding of what life was,

00:18:22.620 --> 00:18:24.000 align:middle line:90%
I would assume.

00:18:24.000 --> 00:18:26.520 align:middle line:84%
>>PURCE: Absolutely,
and chanting together

00:18:26.520 --> 00:18:28.650 align:middle line:84%
was a way of homogenizing
the community,

00:18:28.650 --> 00:18:33.060 align:middle line:84%
or creating good feeling,
or dissolving disharmony

00:18:33.060 --> 00:18:35.580 align:middle line:84%
in the community, and
it's one of the quickest

00:18:35.580 --> 00:18:43.240 align:middle line:84%
ways of creating a harmonious
group, which can work together.

00:18:43.240 --> 00:18:45.480 align:middle line:84%
So I like to think of the
people who work with me,

00:18:45.480 --> 00:18:47.340 align:middle line:84%
we're part of this
sonorous community,

00:18:47.340 --> 00:18:53.880 align:middle line:84%
and I see that, in general, in
the world, we're disenchanted.

00:18:53.880 --> 00:18:55.020 align:middle line:90%
People are complaining.

00:18:55.020 --> 00:18:56.260 align:middle line:90%
They're disenchanted.

00:18:56.260 --> 00:18:58.440 align:middle line:84%
And so my sense of
the remedy of that

00:18:58.440 --> 00:19:03.600 align:middle line:84%
is to enchant, and to enchant
means to make magical again

00:19:03.600 --> 00:19:04.530 align:middle line:90%
through chanting.

00:19:04.530 --> 00:19:06.029 align:middle line:90%
I see it literally.

00:19:06.029 --> 00:19:07.570 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: No, that
makes total sense.

00:19:07.570 --> 00:19:10.260 align:middle line:90%
And in fact, I think you don't--

00:19:10.260 --> 00:19:13.710 align:middle line:84%
well, especially on public
transit here in London,

00:19:13.710 --> 00:19:16.410 align:middle line:84%
I can't even imagine
someone singing.

00:19:16.410 --> 00:19:19.140 align:middle line:84%
I can't imagine
anyone even humming.

00:19:19.140 --> 00:19:20.530 align:middle line:90%
People don't look at each other.

00:19:20.530 --> 00:19:21.330 align:middle line:90%
They don't smile.

00:19:21.330 --> 00:19:23.190 align:middle line:90%
They don't connect.

00:19:23.190 --> 00:19:25.450 align:middle line:90%
And it almost as though--

00:19:25.450 --> 00:19:27.660 align:middle line:84%
not just here, and
this is in the US too--

00:19:27.660 --> 00:19:30.510 align:middle line:84%
the Tube in particular people
really need their privacy,

00:19:30.510 --> 00:19:31.320 align:middle line:90%
I guess.

00:19:31.320 --> 00:19:34.590 align:middle line:84%
But there's this notion
we've almost become

00:19:34.590 --> 00:19:39.120 align:middle line:84%
too sophisticated to be seen
doing something as lowly

00:19:39.120 --> 00:19:41.370 align:middle line:90%
or out of control as singing.

00:19:41.370 --> 00:19:42.900 align:middle line:84%
>>PURCE: Well, I
mean in the Tube

00:19:42.900 --> 00:19:45.810 align:middle line:84%
what we see is everybody
with earphones.

00:19:45.810 --> 00:19:49.260 align:middle line:84%
And earphones are
interesting because we

00:19:49.260 --> 00:19:51.420 align:middle line:84%
have an atavistic memory
that we're supposed

00:19:51.420 --> 00:19:53.370 align:middle line:90%
to have sound inside us.

00:19:53.370 --> 00:19:55.980 align:middle line:84%
So now, because we feel so
disempowered, what we do

00:19:55.980 --> 00:19:58.950 align:middle line:84%
is we empower the professionals
to make the sound,

00:19:58.950 --> 00:20:01.510 align:middle line:84%
and then we try and ram it back
inside us through earphones.

00:20:01.510 --> 00:20:02.310 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:20:02.310 --> 00:20:04.260 align:middle line:84%
>>PURCE: Thinking
that by putting it out

00:20:04.260 --> 00:20:06.570 align:middle line:84%
from outside in by
professionals, then

00:20:06.570 --> 00:20:08.340 align:middle line:90%
we will have sound inside us.

00:20:08.340 --> 00:20:11.670 align:middle line:84%
But actually, this is
the cause of deafness.

00:20:11.670 --> 00:20:13.380 align:middle line:84%
You know, earphones
make us deaf.

00:20:13.380 --> 00:20:17.790 align:middle line:84%
So what we have to
remember is that we

00:20:17.790 --> 00:20:19.880 align:middle line:84%
need to regenerate
the sound ourselves.

00:20:19.880 --> 00:20:21.900 align:middle line:84%
It's only when we
become the instrument.

00:20:21.900 --> 00:20:25.500 align:middle line:84%
So we are instruments, and so
the way that we remain healthy

00:20:25.500 --> 00:20:28.260 align:middle line:84%
is by activating these
resonances within us.

00:20:28.260 --> 00:20:31.920 align:middle line:84%
Otherwise, we're like an
instrument on a shelf that

00:20:31.920 --> 00:20:34.230 align:middle line:90%
becomes tarnished, out of tune.

00:20:34.230 --> 00:20:37.800 align:middle line:84%
And so by activating these
rhythms and these resonances

00:20:37.800 --> 00:20:42.420 align:middle line:84%
within us, we can
resonate and re-harmonize

00:20:42.420 --> 00:20:44.040 align:middle line:84%
all the different
aspects of ourselves

00:20:44.040 --> 00:20:45.582 align:middle line:84%
so that we're
harmonious instruments.

00:20:45.582 --> 00:20:47.373 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: You know,
that makes total sense.

00:20:47.373 --> 00:20:50.190 align:middle line:84%
And you were talking about the
homogeneous nature when we're

00:20:50.190 --> 00:20:52.950 align:middle line:84%
talking about more the
psycho-spiritual field

00:20:52.950 --> 00:20:55.410 align:middle line:84%
of a group of people who
chant or sing together.

00:20:55.410 --> 00:20:59.370 align:middle line:84%
That itself is even
seen as a negative now,

00:20:59.370 --> 00:21:01.530 align:middle line:84%
the notion of
homogeneous culture.

00:21:01.530 --> 00:21:03.300 align:middle line:90%
It's about diversity.

00:21:03.300 --> 00:21:06.000 align:middle line:84%
I mean, politically,
it's about diversity.

00:21:06.000 --> 00:21:10.006 align:middle line:84%
And so what's your
response to that?

00:21:10.006 --> 00:21:11.630 align:middle line:84%
>>PURCE: Yes, well
it's both, isn't it?

00:21:11.630 --> 00:21:16.120 align:middle line:84%
It's glocalization, I
think it's now called.

00:21:16.120 --> 00:21:18.169 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Glocalization.

00:21:18.169 --> 00:21:19.210 align:middle line:90%
I haven't heard that one.

00:21:19.210 --> 00:21:21.430 align:middle line:84%
>>PURCE: Yeah, I think
that's what it's called.

00:21:21.430 --> 00:21:24.360 align:middle line:84%
So one of the
interesting things--

00:21:24.360 --> 00:21:27.460 align:middle line:84%
when I started this, I
realized that we, as a society,

00:21:27.460 --> 00:21:28.360 align:middle line:90%
we've gone silent.

00:21:28.360 --> 00:21:29.160 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:21:29.160 --> 00:21:31.080 align:middle line:84%
>>PURCE: And that all
the traditional ways

00:21:31.080 --> 00:21:32.640 align:middle line:84%
that we had of making
sounds together

00:21:32.640 --> 00:21:34.830 align:middle line:84%
had gone, been eroded
from our society,

00:21:34.830 --> 00:21:37.770 align:middle line:84%
through measuring, and
counting, and trying to predict,

00:21:37.770 --> 00:21:40.120 align:middle line:84%
and remain living through
counting, and measuring.

00:21:40.120 --> 00:21:45.900 align:middle line:84%
And so my agenda was, as
I said, to re-enchant.

00:21:45.900 --> 00:21:51.680 align:middle line:84%
And so when I was trying
to think about this,

00:21:51.680 --> 00:21:54.182 align:middle line:84%
or at least when I look back
on what I was trying to do--

00:21:54.182 --> 00:21:56.640 align:middle line:84%
because when I was doing it I
really wasn't sure what I was

00:21:56.640 --> 00:21:57.660 align:middle line:90%
doing--

00:21:57.660 --> 00:22:00.180 align:middle line:84%
I realized I was asking
the question, if we're

00:22:00.180 --> 00:22:03.250 align:middle line:84%
going to sing again, what
song are we going to sing?

00:22:03.250 --> 00:22:04.050 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:22:04.050 --> 00:22:05.850 align:middle line:84%
>>PURCE: Now, if
we sing in words--

00:22:05.850 --> 00:22:08.940 align:middle line:84%
if we're singing a national
anthem one side of the border,

00:22:08.940 --> 00:22:10.890 align:middle line:84%
you know like in
Europe, for example,

00:22:10.890 --> 00:22:12.954 align:middle line:84%
then we're saying
the right song.

00:22:12.954 --> 00:22:15.120 align:middle line:84%
If we stepped over the
boarder, it's the wrong song.

00:22:15.120 --> 00:22:15.920 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Exactly.

00:22:15.920 --> 00:22:18.150 align:middle line:84%
>>PURCE: So as soon as
you incorporate words,

00:22:18.150 --> 00:22:22.470 align:middle line:84%
then you have this problem
of being OK, appropriate,

00:22:22.470 --> 00:22:24.420 align:middle line:90%
or not appropriate.

00:22:24.420 --> 00:22:27.120 align:middle line:84%
And also, words
are then that which

00:22:27.120 --> 00:22:31.520 align:middle line:84%
keep you in time because words
and language is time bound.

00:22:31.520 --> 00:22:34.440 align:middle line:84%
And so when I was looking
for ways of chanting,

00:22:34.440 --> 00:22:37.940 align:middle line:84%
I was looking for something that
goes beyond the use of words.

00:22:37.940 --> 00:22:40.440 align:middle line:84%
So I worked a lot
with monks and nuns,

00:22:40.440 --> 00:22:42.630 align:middle line:84%
for example, who have
this tradition of chanting

00:22:42.630 --> 00:22:45.360 align:middle line:90%
five times a day, or did.

00:22:45.360 --> 00:22:49.780 align:middle line:84%
It's now being eroded by things
that they need to do and so on.

00:22:49.780 --> 00:22:53.670 align:middle line:84%
But so what I realized was
there was this movement

00:22:53.670 --> 00:22:55.830 align:middle line:84%
in the '50s of
re-vernacularizing

00:22:55.830 --> 00:22:59.340 align:middle line:84%
or vernacularizing the chants
that were traditionally--

00:22:59.340 --> 00:23:02.430 align:middle line:84%
people have always chanted
in archaic languages.

00:23:02.430 --> 00:23:05.010 align:middle line:84%
So they have the
intention to chant,

00:23:05.010 --> 00:23:08.190 align:middle line:84%
but not being bound
by the meanings.

00:23:08.190 --> 00:23:11.790 align:middle line:84%
As soon as you've translated
it into local languages,

00:23:11.790 --> 00:23:14.580 align:middle line:84%
then you're caught
by the meaning,

00:23:14.580 --> 00:23:16.650 align:middle line:84%
so you have to think
about what you're doing.

00:23:16.650 --> 00:23:19.200 align:middle line:84%
And then, for example,
if I sing hymns,

00:23:19.200 --> 00:23:22.560 align:middle line:84%
I find that I've sung
verses one to four,

00:23:22.560 --> 00:23:24.600 align:middle line:84%
and I have no idea
what I'm singing about

00:23:24.600 --> 00:23:26.530 align:middle line:84%
because I don't
listen to the words.

00:23:26.530 --> 00:23:28.350 align:middle line:84%
And so I spend the
whole of verse five

00:23:28.350 --> 00:23:30.600 align:middle line:84%
rereading verses one
to four, and then I

00:23:30.600 --> 00:23:32.070 align:middle line:84%
don't know what
verse 5 is about.

00:23:32.070 --> 00:23:32.870 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:23:32.870 --> 00:23:34.650 align:middle line:84%
>>PURCE: So the
problem is language.

00:23:34.650 --> 00:23:38.610 align:middle line:84%
So the idea is to go beyond
language, to use language

00:23:38.610 --> 00:23:39.660 align:middle line:90%
to go beyond language.

00:23:39.660 --> 00:23:43.020 align:middle line:84%
And so one of the things that
I discovered when I first

00:23:43.020 --> 00:23:46.410 align:middle line:84%
started this many,
many years ago

00:23:46.410 --> 00:23:50.200 align:middle line:84%
was a form of chanting
from Central Asia.

00:23:50.200 --> 00:23:55.110 align:middle line:84%
And this kind of chanting
chants on a single note and then

00:23:55.110 --> 00:23:59.220 align:middle line:84%
goes into that note to
amplify the sounds that

00:23:59.220 --> 00:24:02.040 align:middle line:84%
are contained within that note,
which are called harmonics

00:24:02.040 --> 00:24:06.390 align:middle line:84%
or overtones, which you
can then hear floating

00:24:06.390 --> 00:24:09.840 align:middle line:84%
above the fundamental note
as high flute-like sounds.

00:24:09.840 --> 00:24:13.350 align:middle line:84%
Now, this is very interesting
because in Western music

00:24:13.350 --> 00:24:16.650 align:middle line:84%
in the 17th century, with
the popularity of keyboard

00:24:16.650 --> 00:24:21.990 align:middle line:84%
instruments, we retuned our
instruments because the pianos

00:24:21.990 --> 00:24:24.990 align:middle line:84%
or keyboards were in tune in
one part but very out of tune

00:24:24.990 --> 00:24:26.470 align:middle line:90%
in another.

00:24:26.470 --> 00:24:30.170 align:middle line:84%
And so it was a real
problem of tuning,

00:24:30.170 --> 00:24:32.550 align:middle line:84%
so this was a problem
which concerned

00:24:32.550 --> 00:24:35.820 align:middle line:84%
mathematicians, musicians,
polymaths of all kinds.

00:24:35.820 --> 00:24:37.740 align:middle line:90%
And so what was adopted--

00:24:37.740 --> 00:24:40.080 align:middle line:84%
many, many versions
were proposed--

00:24:40.080 --> 00:24:41.490 align:middle line:84%
and what we adopted
in was what's

00:24:41.490 --> 00:24:45.030 align:middle line:84%
called the tempered scale,
the well-tempered scale.

00:24:45.030 --> 00:24:47.820 align:middle line:84%
So Bach, for
example, uses a form

00:24:47.820 --> 00:24:50.490 align:middle line:84%
of this, which he
then demonstrates

00:24:50.490 --> 00:24:54.820 align:middle line:84%
for the preludes and fugues
for the Well-Tempered Clavier.

00:24:54.820 --> 00:24:59.780 align:middle line:84%
So he shows how you can now
play in every key, which

00:24:59.780 --> 00:25:00.780 align:middle line:90%
was not possible before.

00:25:00.780 --> 00:25:04.950 align:middle line:84%
So all music since Bach
has been out of tune,

00:25:04.950 --> 00:25:07.590 align:middle line:84%
and at the same time, would
never have been possible

00:25:07.590 --> 00:25:09.210 align:middle line:90%
without this retuning.

00:25:09.210 --> 00:25:11.670 align:middle line:84%
So I like to think of this
as the Faustian bargain.

00:25:11.670 --> 00:25:14.790 align:middle line:84%
We'll make all our
music out of tune,

00:25:14.790 --> 00:25:18.120 align:middle line:84%
and then look what
we can do with it.

00:25:18.120 --> 00:25:18.960 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:25:18.960 --> 00:25:20.010 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:25:20.010 --> 00:25:23.170 align:middle line:84%
Well, that brings us to
some interesting discussion.

00:25:23.170 --> 00:25:26.430 align:middle line:84%
So if modern music
is out of tune,

00:25:26.430 --> 00:25:30.490 align:middle line:84%
and we're all subjecting
ourselves to it all the time,

00:25:30.490 --> 00:25:33.570 align:middle line:84%
first of all, what is that doing
to us on a personal integration

00:25:33.570 --> 00:25:35.430 align:middle line:90%
or disintegration level?

00:25:35.430 --> 00:25:37.110 align:middle line:84%
>>PURCE: Well,
firstly, when this

00:25:37.110 --> 00:25:40.710 align:middle line:84%
was done in the 17th century, it
was thought-- so what happened

00:25:40.710 --> 00:25:45.390 align:middle line:84%
was a traditional tuning would
go from a note to the note

00:25:45.390 --> 00:25:47.280 align:middle line:84%
five notes above,
and then from that

00:25:47.280 --> 00:25:49.650 align:middle line:84%
note, five notes about
that, and then five.

00:25:49.650 --> 00:25:51.210 align:middle line:90%
It's called the cycle of fifths.

00:25:51.210 --> 00:25:54.360 align:middle line:90%
[HUMMING] And then so on.

00:25:54.360 --> 00:25:57.000 align:middle line:84%
And then you should, in
theory, come to the octave

00:25:57.000 --> 00:25:58.620 align:middle line:90%
above where you started.

00:25:58.620 --> 00:26:00.390 align:middle line:84%
But in fact, what
happens is you don't.

00:26:00.390 --> 00:26:03.000 align:middle line:84%
Overlap it by a
quarter of a semitone

00:26:03.000 --> 00:26:05.730 align:middle line:90%
known as the Pythagorean comma.

00:26:05.730 --> 00:26:09.660 align:middle line:84%
So the problem of tuning was
what to do with this overlap.

00:26:09.660 --> 00:26:12.030 align:middle line:84%
So what was done in
the 17th century,

00:26:12.030 --> 00:26:15.570 align:middle line:84%
how they solved this problem,
this Faustian bargain as I like

00:26:15.570 --> 00:26:18.420 align:middle line:84%
to think of it, was
they took this interval,

00:26:18.420 --> 00:26:20.270 align:middle line:84%
and they put it back
inside the octave,

00:26:20.270 --> 00:26:22.680 align:middle line:84%
making all the intervals
in the octave slightly

00:26:22.680 --> 00:26:26.910 align:middle line:84%
bigger or slightly
smaller, hence out of tune.

00:26:26.910 --> 00:26:30.384 align:middle line:84%
So all music since then,
since it's the 17th century,

00:26:30.384 --> 00:26:31.800 align:middle line:84%
has been a little
bit out of tune.

00:26:31.800 --> 00:26:34.960 align:middle line:84%
And since we export our
music all over the world,

00:26:34.960 --> 00:26:37.320 align:middle line:84%
it means pretty much
everywhere now is out of tune.

00:26:37.320 --> 00:26:39.690 align:middle line:90%
And so what it does is it--

00:26:39.690 --> 00:26:41.940 align:middle line:84%
well, firstly, it was thought
that it wouldn't matter,

00:26:41.940 --> 00:26:42.981 align:middle line:90%
that nobody would notice.

00:26:42.981 --> 00:26:45.620 align:middle line:84%
And most people don't
because it's very little.

00:26:45.620 --> 00:26:47.902 align:middle line:84%
And in fact, our piano
tuner comes to our house,

00:26:47.902 --> 00:26:49.110 align:middle line:90%
and we have this little joke.

00:26:49.110 --> 00:26:53.610 align:middle line:84%
And I say, hey Bruce, you
know, are the octaves in tune?

00:26:53.610 --> 00:26:55.315 align:middle line:90%
And he says stretched.

00:26:55.315 --> 00:26:57.790 align:middle line:84%
And so I say, Bruce,
are the octaves in tune?

00:26:57.790 --> 00:26:59.720 align:middle line:90%
And he says stretched.

00:26:59.720 --> 00:27:02.370 align:middle line:84%
And so now when he goes
to tune people's pianos,

00:27:02.370 --> 00:27:06.060 align:middle line:84%
his joke is that he's going
to stretch their octave.

00:27:06.060 --> 00:27:10.840 align:middle line:84%
So, naturally, we're
a resonant system.

00:27:10.840 --> 00:27:13.590 align:middle line:84%
And so if we're all listening
to music that's out of tune,

00:27:13.590 --> 00:27:15.927 align:middle line:84%
even though we don't
know it's out of tune,

00:27:15.927 --> 00:27:17.760 align:middle line:84%
we are, of course, out
of tune, and I say it

00:27:17.760 --> 00:27:20.160 align:middle line:90%
as a pathology of our times.

00:27:20.160 --> 00:27:23.070 align:middle line:84%
The music that we're listening
to, the music that we're making

00:27:23.070 --> 00:27:24.420 align:middle line:90%
is out of tune.

00:27:24.420 --> 00:27:31.530 align:middle line:84%
And so the reason that I adopted
this form of chanting as a way

00:27:31.530 --> 00:27:36.730 align:middle line:84%
in for people, where we
chant on a single note

00:27:36.730 --> 00:27:39.370 align:middle line:84%
and then amplify the harmonics
because the harmonics

00:27:39.370 --> 00:27:41.440 align:middle line:84%
come about through
resonance, which

00:27:41.440 --> 00:27:43.671 align:middle line:90%
means literally to resound.

00:27:43.671 --> 00:27:45.670 align:middle line:84%
And the sounds that come
about through resonance

00:27:45.670 --> 00:27:47.770 align:middle line:90%
can only be in tune.

00:27:47.770 --> 00:27:50.710 align:middle line:84%
And so how I came
to be doing this--

00:27:50.710 --> 00:27:53.650 align:middle line:84%
there are two aspects
of how I received this.

00:27:53.650 --> 00:27:57.520 align:middle line:84%
One was through, starting
with Tibetan Lamas

00:27:57.520 --> 00:28:00.550 align:middle line:84%
from the '60s
onwards, where they

00:28:00.550 --> 00:28:04.330 align:middle line:84%
have certain tantric colleges
within Tibetan Buddhism have

00:28:04.330 --> 00:28:07.090 align:middle line:90%
this form of chanting.

00:28:07.090 --> 00:28:11.170 align:middle line:84%
And so I studied with
the Gyuto chant master

00:28:11.170 --> 00:28:14.530 align:middle line:90%
who teaches this to his monks.

00:28:14.530 --> 00:28:17.290 align:middle line:84%
And then, in the
early '70s, I worked

00:28:17.290 --> 00:28:20.380 align:middle line:84%
with Karlheinz Stockhausen,
the German composer,

00:28:20.380 --> 00:28:22.570 align:middle line:84%
who in 1968 had
written a piece called

00:28:22.570 --> 00:28:27.310 align:middle line:84%
Stimmung for Six Singers who
chants on a B-flat on one note,

00:28:27.310 --> 00:28:30.420 align:middle line:84%
and then through
a very simple form

00:28:30.420 --> 00:28:35.020 align:middle line:84%
of exaggerating the
vowels, they produce

00:28:35.020 --> 00:28:36.760 align:middle line:84%
the harmonics which
can be just heard

00:28:36.760 --> 00:28:38.740 align:middle line:90%
over the fundamental note.

00:28:38.740 --> 00:28:42.770 align:middle line:84%
So this was a way of chanting,
which when I started,

00:28:42.770 --> 00:28:47.440 align:middle line:84%
had not been heard really
except by a few arcane musicians

00:28:47.440 --> 00:28:50.890 align:middle line:84%
interested in Stockhausen or
Tibetan or Mongolian chant.

00:28:50.890 --> 00:28:54.280 align:middle line:84%
And so I find it an
extraordinary way in,

00:28:54.280 --> 00:28:58.180 align:middle line:84%
both for musicians
who'd never heard it

00:28:58.180 --> 00:29:02.120 align:middle line:84%
and for people who had been told
to stand at the back and mouth

00:29:02.120 --> 00:29:05.770 align:middle line:84%
it, who people considered
that the sounds came out

00:29:05.770 --> 00:29:08.440 align:middle line:84%
of their mouth was unacceptable
because it was out of tune.

00:29:08.440 --> 00:29:09.340 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:29:09.340 --> 00:29:11.110 align:middle line:84%
Right, that's interesting
because our ear

00:29:11.110 --> 00:29:14.230 align:middle line:84%
has become accustomed
to the music

00:29:14.230 --> 00:29:17.440 align:middle line:84%
that we've been hearing in our
lifetime, which is out of tune.

00:29:17.440 --> 00:29:21.940 align:middle line:84%
So now when we hear the pure
tones, that can sound dissonant

00:29:21.940 --> 00:29:24.084 align:middle line:90%
to us to the ear, can't it?

00:29:24.084 --> 00:29:26.500 align:middle line:84%
>>PURCE: Well, I think we very
rarely hear the pure tones,

00:29:26.500 --> 00:29:32.740 align:middle line:84%
and with the overtones, when we
hear them, it's like a memory.

00:29:32.740 --> 00:29:36.880 align:middle line:84%
It's like recognition,
which means to re-cognize,

00:29:36.880 --> 00:29:40.090 align:middle line:84%
to again know, and we can
only again know something

00:29:40.090 --> 00:29:42.550 align:middle line:90%
that we knew before.

00:29:42.550 --> 00:29:45.040 align:middle line:84%
And how we knew these before
is because we're hearing

00:29:45.040 --> 00:29:47.410 align:middle line:90%
our own geometry made audible.

00:29:47.410 --> 00:29:49.100 align:middle line:90%
So we're hearing ourselves.

00:29:49.100 --> 00:29:50.950 align:middle line:90%
And there's a real--

00:29:50.950 --> 00:29:52.060 align:middle line:90%
it's like coming home.

00:29:52.060 --> 00:29:55.120 align:middle line:84%
So when we hear
the harmonics, it's

00:29:55.120 --> 00:29:58.510 align:middle line:84%
like a reclamation of our
understanding of all that is.

00:29:58.510 --> 00:30:00.290 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Really on
a subconscious level.

00:30:00.290 --> 00:30:01.060 align:middle line:90%
>>PURCE: On all levels.

00:30:01.060 --> 00:30:01.540 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:30:01.540 --> 00:30:02.340 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

00:30:02.340 --> 00:30:05.320 align:middle line:84%
OK, so if we're talking
about Western music,

00:30:05.320 --> 00:30:08.800 align:middle line:84%
if we're talking about the
influence of let's just say

00:30:08.800 --> 00:30:11.110 align:middle line:84%
American and British
music alone that

00:30:11.110 --> 00:30:17.470 align:middle line:84%
has been exported all around
the world, as much as we

00:30:17.470 --> 00:30:21.250 align:middle line:84%
prize diversity,
culturally, sexually,

00:30:21.250 --> 00:30:25.240 align:middle line:84%
in every other way that is
now the basis of society is

00:30:25.240 --> 00:30:31.600 align:middle line:84%
to promote diversity, where we
have a pretty homogeneous kind

00:30:31.600 --> 00:30:34.930 align:middle line:84%
of output in terms of music
and what is being given

00:30:34.930 --> 00:30:36.640 align:middle line:90%
to the world, which is really--

00:30:36.640 --> 00:30:38.560 align:middle line:84%
what does that do
to societies when

00:30:38.560 --> 00:30:40.570 align:middle line:84%
they're all listening
to the same tune,

00:30:40.570 --> 00:30:45.640 align:middle line:84%
and that's not of their culture,
it's not of their genetics?

00:30:45.640 --> 00:30:47.740 align:middle line:90%
You understand what I'm saying?

00:30:47.740 --> 00:30:53.640 align:middle line:84%
>>PURCE: Yes, well I think
the whole musical exportation

00:30:53.640 --> 00:30:55.870 align:middle line:84%
and culture is a
real problem and is

00:30:55.870 --> 00:30:59.460 align:middle line:84%
a sign of the dysfunctionality
of our society.

00:30:59.460 --> 00:31:03.550 align:middle line:84%
And it's a cause
of real separation,

00:31:03.550 --> 00:31:05.740 align:middle line:84%
and so what I'm trying
to do with sound

00:31:05.740 --> 00:31:10.930 align:middle line:84%
is to allow us to overcome
the separation, to become one,

00:31:10.930 --> 00:31:16.120 align:middle line:84%
to become present, to be
in the flow, to be healed,

00:31:16.120 --> 00:31:19.750 align:middle line:84%
to re-resonate all
of the harmonics

00:31:19.750 --> 00:31:22.050 align:middle line:84%
and the resonation and
the patterns within us

00:31:22.050 --> 00:31:24.280 align:middle line:90%
and to become whole.

00:31:24.280 --> 00:31:25.120 align:middle line:90%
I see that.

00:31:25.120 --> 00:31:29.710 align:middle line:84%
And to reclaim the sonorous
community that we once had.

00:31:29.710 --> 00:31:32.290 align:middle line:84%
And so I do all kinds of
things with sound, you know.

00:31:32.290 --> 00:31:36.340 align:middle line:84%
I'm trying to re-educate us
so that we have these tools.

00:31:36.340 --> 00:31:39.250 align:middle line:90%


00:31:39.250 --> 00:31:41.860 align:middle line:84%
And then I use it
in other ways, and I

00:31:41.860 --> 00:31:44.550 align:middle line:84%
work with Family Patterns
and Family Constellations

00:31:44.550 --> 00:31:46.099 align:middle line:90%
and interruption--

00:31:46.099 --> 00:31:47.890 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And let's
about that in a moment.

00:31:47.890 --> 00:31:48.799 align:middle line:90%
>>PURCE: Absolutely.

00:31:48.799 --> 00:31:49.840 align:middle line:90%
And so I use it that way.

00:31:49.840 --> 00:31:51.530 align:middle line:84%
And then I do
extended ceremonies,

00:31:51.530 --> 00:31:54.310 align:middle line:84%
which last a week,
things that haven't

00:31:54.310 --> 00:31:57.320 align:middle line:84%
happened in our society
for a generation.

00:31:57.320 --> 00:31:59.692 align:middle line:84%
Or using sound trying
to not just teach

00:31:59.692 --> 00:32:01.150 align:middle line:84%
ways of viewing
sound, but actually

00:32:01.150 --> 00:32:02.999 align:middle line:90%
to put it into practice.

00:32:02.999 --> 00:32:05.290 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Don't you have a
workshop coming up actually?

00:32:05.290 --> 00:32:06.305 align:middle line:90%
>>PURCE: I do this weekend.

00:32:06.305 --> 00:32:07.263 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: I thought so.

00:32:07.263 --> 00:32:09.830 align:middle line:90%
There's one coming up very soon.

00:32:09.830 --> 00:32:12.514 align:middle line:84%
And what kind of-- before
we go into that, let's

00:32:12.514 --> 00:32:13.680 align:middle line:90%
just talk about the effects.

00:32:13.680 --> 00:32:17.350 align:middle line:84%
What kind of effects does being
together, chanting together

00:32:17.350 --> 00:32:19.205 align:middle line:84%
for a week, seem to
have on the people

00:32:19.205 --> 00:32:21.770 align:middle line:84%
when they're coming
out the other end?

00:32:21.770 --> 00:32:23.490 align:middle line:84%
>>PURCE: It's
completely blissful.

00:32:23.490 --> 00:32:28.920 align:middle line:84%
I think people--
they fall in love

00:32:28.920 --> 00:32:33.750 align:middle line:84%
with each other as a community,
so they rediscover the sort

00:32:33.750 --> 00:32:35.610 align:middle line:90%
of joy of being together.

00:32:35.610 --> 00:32:43.820 align:middle line:84%
And they rediscover what
happens when they're completely

00:32:43.820 --> 00:32:45.170 align:middle line:90%
in the now, in the present.

00:32:45.170 --> 00:32:49.070 align:middle line:84%
So it's an utterly joyful
ecstatic experience,

00:32:49.070 --> 00:32:51.162 align:middle line:84%
which changes people's
lives instantly.

00:32:51.162 --> 00:32:53.370 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Yeah, I can feel
that just talking with you

00:32:53.370 --> 00:32:54.500 align:middle line:90%
that that would be the case.

00:32:54.500 --> 00:32:55.416 align:middle line:90%
That sounds wonderful.

00:32:55.416 --> 00:32:57.770 align:middle line:84%
I mean, I think that's
also why a lot of people

00:32:57.770 --> 00:33:01.340 align:middle line:84%
head to foreign countries,
why Americans and Brits head

00:33:01.340 --> 00:33:05.030 align:middle line:84%
to India, so you have a chance
to chant in Sanskrit together

00:33:05.030 --> 00:33:06.710 align:middle line:84%
because we've left
behind the traditions

00:33:06.710 --> 00:33:08.240 align:middle line:90%
of our own countries.

00:33:08.240 --> 00:33:12.860 align:middle line:84%
And as you say, I think this
also has a double effect of--

00:33:12.860 --> 00:33:15.200 align:middle line:84%
we're chanting in
a language we have

00:33:15.200 --> 00:33:17.180 align:middle line:90%
no understanding of whatsoever.

00:33:17.180 --> 00:33:18.960 align:middle line:90%
So it's just really tones.

00:33:18.960 --> 00:33:21.590 align:middle line:84%
It's just vowels and
consonants, right?

00:33:21.590 --> 00:33:24.690 align:middle line:84%
And so, on that note of
vowels and consonants,

00:33:24.690 --> 00:33:26.870 align:middle line:84%
you talk about the
extension of one

00:33:26.870 --> 00:33:29.370 align:middle line:84%
and the clipped cutting
off from the other.

00:33:29.370 --> 00:33:31.430 align:middle line:84%
So let's talk about
the mechanics of vowels

00:33:31.430 --> 00:33:33.200 align:middle line:90%
and consonants a moment.

00:33:33.200 --> 00:33:36.440 align:middle line:84%
>>PURCE: Well, just in
terms of archaic languages

00:33:36.440 --> 00:33:40.880 align:middle line:84%
before we do that, when I
work with monks and nuns,

00:33:40.880 --> 00:33:44.270 align:middle line:84%
very often, they asked me
to do the overtone chanting

00:33:44.270 --> 00:33:49.610 align:middle line:84%
because the tradition that
they had of chanting five times

00:33:49.610 --> 00:33:52.760 align:middle line:84%
a day was one of induction
of contemplation.

00:33:52.760 --> 00:33:54.920 align:middle line:84%
And it no longer does
that because they

00:33:54.920 --> 00:33:57.320 align:middle line:84%
have to chant a
liturgy so many times.

00:33:57.320 --> 00:34:01.280 align:middle line:84%
And again, this problem of
being immersed in the meaning

00:34:01.280 --> 00:34:05.360 align:middle line:84%
rather than using the sound
to go beyond sound, to

00:34:05.360 --> 00:34:07.000 align:middle line:84%
go into the nature
of mind itself.

00:34:07.000 --> 00:34:08.000 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right

00:34:08.000 --> 00:34:12.170 align:middle line:84%
>>PURCE: And so they
very often ask me

00:34:12.170 --> 00:34:15.710 align:middle line:84%
to do this kind of chanting
because for them, it's

00:34:15.710 --> 00:34:17.210 align:middle line:90%
a relief.

00:34:17.210 --> 00:34:20.540 align:middle line:84%
And in fact, the abbess
of one such community

00:34:20.540 --> 00:34:22.790 align:middle line:84%
said that it was the
one thing that she

00:34:22.790 --> 00:34:26.060 align:middle line:84%
used to take her novitiate
and teach them this,

00:34:26.060 --> 00:34:28.550 align:middle line:84%
and she said it's the
one thing that enabled

00:34:28.550 --> 00:34:30.750 align:middle line:90%
her to remain as abbess.

00:34:30.750 --> 00:34:34.159 align:middle line:84%
She was constantly being
re-voted in as abbess,

00:34:34.159 --> 00:34:35.989 align:middle line:84%
and she said that
this form of chanting

00:34:35.989 --> 00:34:38.330 align:middle line:84%
had so changed her
life and given her

00:34:38.330 --> 00:34:42.659 align:middle line:84%
such a tool that it enabled
her to go on doing this.

00:34:42.659 --> 00:34:45.590 align:middle line:84%
So to get back to vowels
and consonants, when

00:34:45.590 --> 00:34:48.679 align:middle line:84%
we make vocal
sounds, we divide it

00:34:48.679 --> 00:34:51.430 align:middle line:84%
very crudely into these two
different ways of making up

00:34:51.430 --> 00:34:52.230 align:middle line:90%
sounds.

00:34:52.230 --> 00:34:57.700 align:middle line:84%
So first of all, we generate
the breath, which comes up.

00:34:57.700 --> 00:35:00.410 align:middle line:84%
And if we don't interrupt
the way that it comes out,

00:35:00.410 --> 00:35:02.510 align:middle line:90%
then we call this vowel.

00:35:02.510 --> 00:35:05.390 align:middle line:84%
If we interrupt it
with teeth, and tongue,

00:35:05.390 --> 00:35:08.520 align:middle line:84%
and all the various mechanisms
that we have for doing that,

00:35:08.520 --> 00:35:12.420 align:middle line:84%
then we are creating
noise sound.

00:35:12.420 --> 00:35:17.520 align:middle line:84%
So if the waveform is ordered,
then we call it tone or sound.

00:35:17.520 --> 00:35:22.940 align:middle line:84%
And if we interrupt it, and
if the waveforms are chaotic,

00:35:22.940 --> 00:35:24.980 align:middle line:90%
then we call that noise.

00:35:24.980 --> 00:35:26.435 align:middle line:84%
And then a complete
noise is what

00:35:26.435 --> 00:35:27.940 align:middle line:84%
we call white noise,
where the wave

00:35:27.940 --> 00:35:30.030 align:middle line:90%
forms are completely chaotic.

00:35:30.030 --> 00:35:35.060 align:middle line:84%
And so with consonance,
there's this interspersion

00:35:35.060 --> 00:35:43.040 align:middle line:84%
of chaotic acoustic waves
into the otherwise flow

00:35:43.040 --> 00:35:45.560 align:middle line:84%
of pure vowels, which
are pure tones, which

00:35:45.560 --> 00:35:47.960 align:middle line:90%
are what we call harmonics.

00:35:47.960 --> 00:35:51.200 align:middle line:84%
And so when we speak,
it's a more or less equal.

00:35:51.200 --> 00:35:53.000 align:middle line:84%
You know, so this
is a vowel sound,

00:35:53.000 --> 00:35:57.410 align:middle line:84%
which is the air coming up
uninterrupted, but just shaped

00:35:57.410 --> 00:36:00.750 align:middle line:84%
by the shape of the vocal
cavity, which determines which

00:36:00.750 --> 00:36:03.450 align:middle line:90%
vowels we're going to make.

00:36:03.450 --> 00:36:06.680 align:middle line:84%
And then, when we are speaking
with more or less equal,

00:36:06.680 --> 00:36:09.230 align:middle line:84%
we interrupt that in order
to punctuate it, in order

00:36:09.230 --> 00:36:12.710 align:middle line:84%
to make sense of what's gone
before with consonant sounds,

00:36:12.710 --> 00:36:13.880 align:middle line:90%
excuse me.

00:36:13.880 --> 00:36:16.370 align:middle line:84%
And so what's interesting
about-- as soon

00:36:16.370 --> 00:36:21.350 align:middle line:84%
as you change from
speaking into chanting,

00:36:21.350 --> 00:36:22.860 align:middle line:84%
then the one thing
that you do is

00:36:22.860 --> 00:36:27.290 align:middle line:84%
you are extending the vowel
because the only thing you

00:36:27.290 --> 00:36:31.370 align:middle line:84%
can extend when you're
chanting, intoning, or singing

00:36:31.370 --> 00:36:32.390 align:middle line:90%
is the vowel sound.

00:36:32.390 --> 00:36:34.320 align:middle line:84%
You don't extend the
noise of the sounds.

00:36:34.320 --> 00:36:35.120 align:middle line:90%
You don't--

00:36:35.120 --> 00:36:36.100 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: The punctuations.

00:36:36.100 --> 00:36:36.900 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

00:36:36.900 --> 00:36:40.640 align:middle line:84%
>>PURCE: So what you
extend is the vowel.

00:36:40.640 --> 00:36:45.740 align:middle line:84%
So the vowel is what
creates the harmonic.

00:36:45.740 --> 00:36:50.910 align:middle line:84%
So the harmonic is a supremely
ordered aspect of the sound.

00:36:50.910 --> 00:36:53.350 align:middle line:84%
If a consonant is
the noise component,

00:36:53.350 --> 00:36:55.800 align:middle line:84%
and the vowel is the
harmonic component,

00:36:55.800 --> 00:36:57.860 align:middle line:90%
almost like a sine wave.

00:36:57.860 --> 00:37:03.340 align:middle line:84%
So when you extend the sound,
what you're extending is order.

00:37:03.340 --> 00:37:05.990 align:middle line:90%
You are extending the harmonic.

00:37:05.990 --> 00:37:09.410 align:middle line:84%
And so in all traditions, the
development of consciousness

00:37:09.410 --> 00:37:16.550 align:middle line:84%
has been likened to, through
language, the induction

00:37:16.550 --> 00:37:17.400 align:middle line:90%
of order.

00:37:17.400 --> 00:37:20.240 align:middle line:84%
So in the Tibetan
tradition, diamond mind.

00:37:20.240 --> 00:37:24.265 align:middle line:84%
So a diamond is carbon atoms
in their most ordered state.

00:37:24.265 --> 00:37:26.529 align:middle line:84%
So on the one hand,
you have a lead pencil,

00:37:26.529 --> 00:37:28.320 align:middle line:84%
and then the other hand
you have a diamond,

00:37:28.320 --> 00:37:31.310 align:middle line:84%
which is supremely ordered,
can cut anything else,

00:37:31.310 --> 00:37:33.680 align:middle line:90%
and is utterly transparent.

00:37:33.680 --> 00:37:37.340 align:middle line:84%
So the idea of the
development of consciousness

00:37:37.340 --> 00:37:40.500 align:middle line:84%
is elided with this
induction of order.

00:37:40.500 --> 00:37:42.900 align:middle line:84%
So with sound,
that which carries

00:37:42.900 --> 00:37:45.265 align:middle line:84%
the order of the harmonics,
which mean the vowels.

00:37:45.265 --> 00:37:46.140 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: The vowels.

00:37:46.140 --> 00:37:50.100 align:middle line:84%
What happens when you dominantly
speak a language that's

00:37:50.100 --> 00:37:52.080 align:middle line:90%
virtually all consonants?

00:37:52.080 --> 00:37:56.550 align:middle line:84%
I mean, I think of
Welsh, even Hungarian

00:37:56.550 --> 00:37:58.920 align:middle line:84%
to a large extent,
certain languages that

00:37:58.920 --> 00:38:02.940 align:middle line:84%
seem to have a lot of
consonants, just almost

00:38:02.940 --> 00:38:04.110 align:middle line:90%
no vowels.

00:38:04.110 --> 00:38:09.270 align:middle line:84%
What happens to the
psyche, the emotions,

00:38:09.270 --> 00:38:13.080 align:middle line:84%
the spirit of a
culture that is lacking

00:38:13.080 --> 00:38:14.374 align:middle line:90%
vowels for the most part?

00:38:14.374 --> 00:38:16.540 align:middle line:84%
>>PURCE: Well, I think
language is very interesting,

00:38:16.540 --> 00:38:20.442 align:middle line:84%
and I think the kind of language
we speak affects our psyche.

00:38:20.442 --> 00:38:21.900 align:middle line:84%
And what kind of
language you speak

00:38:21.900 --> 00:38:29.040 align:middle line:84%
is related to the landscape
we are bought up into as well.

00:38:29.040 --> 00:38:31.260 align:middle line:84%
But technically, it's not
possible to have no vowels

00:38:31.260 --> 00:38:33.532 align:middle line:84%
because the sound that
comes up and out is vowels.

00:38:33.532 --> 00:38:34.740 align:middle line:90%
It's only when we interrupt--

00:38:34.740 --> 00:38:36.000 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: But you
know what I mean.

00:38:36.000 --> 00:38:36.510 align:middle line:90%
>>PURCE: Absolutely.

00:38:36.510 --> 00:38:38.040 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: In Welsh,
I mean, it appears

00:38:38.040 --> 00:38:39.040 align:middle line:90%
to be virtually all consonants.

00:38:39.040 --> 00:38:41.070 align:middle line:84%
>>PURCE: Well, certainly
when it's written it is.

00:38:41.070 --> 00:38:42.990 align:middle line:84%
I don't know about the
sounds of Welsh though.

00:38:42.990 --> 00:38:45.475 align:middle line:90%
I think when it's spoken--

00:38:45.475 --> 00:38:47.850 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: You still get the
vowels and the breath running

00:38:47.850 --> 00:38:48.930 align:middle line:90%
through it, of course.

00:38:48.930 --> 00:38:51.140 align:middle line:84%
>>PURCE: And sacred
languages have no vowels.

00:38:51.140 --> 00:38:56.520 align:middle line:84%
So for example, Arabic,
or Hebrew, or Egyptian.

00:38:56.520 --> 00:38:57.400 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Exactly.

00:38:57.400 --> 00:38:59.010 align:middle line:84%
>>PURCE: Never
notated the vowels.

00:38:59.010 --> 00:39:05.060 align:middle line:84%
And so even if you see
the word in Hebrew of God,

00:39:05.060 --> 00:39:08.070 align:middle line:84%
it would be G dot dot
dot D, for example.

00:39:08.070 --> 00:39:12.450 align:middle line:84%
Or [SPEAKING HEBREW] So
Yahweh is all vowels sounds.

00:39:12.450 --> 00:39:15.450 align:middle line:84%
So very often in
archaic traditions,

00:39:15.450 --> 00:39:19.080 align:middle line:84%
the divine, the name of the
divine is only vowel sounds.

00:39:19.080 --> 00:39:21.390 align:middle line:84%
But in notation,
the vowel sounds

00:39:21.390 --> 00:39:22.900 align:middle line:90%
are indicated, inferred--

00:39:22.900 --> 00:39:23.700 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: I see.

00:39:23.700 --> 00:39:25.241 align:middle line:84%
>>PURCE: Above and
below, but they're

00:39:25.241 --> 00:39:28.239 align:middle line:84%
not actually written because
to write a vowel sound

00:39:28.239 --> 00:39:30.780 align:middle line:84%
would be to try and limit that
which is without limits, which

00:39:30.780 --> 00:39:32.470 align:middle line:90%
is the divine.

00:39:32.470 --> 00:39:37.682 align:middle line:84%
And so very often, these vowels
are suggested and inferred.

00:39:37.682 --> 00:39:40.140 align:middle line:84%
One of the reasons we didn't
know how to pronounce Egyptian

00:39:40.140 --> 00:39:41.880 align:middle line:84%
was because we didn't
have the vowels notated.

00:39:41.880 --> 00:39:42.610 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:39:42.610 --> 00:39:43.260 align:middle line:90%
Right.

00:39:43.260 --> 00:39:45.450 align:middle line:84%
Well, I just find it interesting
because some languages

00:39:45.450 --> 00:39:47.670 align:middle line:84%
to the ear appear to be much
more clipped and ordered

00:39:47.670 --> 00:39:49.860 align:middle line:84%
toward consonants,
much more punctuated,

00:39:49.860 --> 00:39:52.350 align:middle line:84%
and others seem more extended
and seem to flow more,

00:39:52.350 --> 00:39:54.490 align:middle line:84%
the Latin languages,
for example,

00:39:54.490 --> 00:39:57.420 align:middle line:84%
seem to feel like they
have more breath, like they

00:39:57.420 --> 00:39:58.644 align:middle line:90%
have more vowels to it.

00:39:58.644 --> 00:40:00.060 align:middle line:84%
And we all like
listening to them.

00:40:00.060 --> 00:40:01.643 align:middle line:84%
>>PURCE: Yes, well,
I mean, this would

00:40:01.643 --> 00:40:04.470 align:middle line:84%
be a very
unfashionable research,

00:40:04.470 --> 00:40:05.880 align:middle line:90%
the one that should be done.

00:40:05.880 --> 00:40:07.710 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: I think
it would be too.

00:40:07.710 --> 00:40:09.850 align:middle line:84%
>>PURCE: I mean, I think,
we look like we speak.

00:40:09.850 --> 00:40:10.650 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:40:10.650 --> 00:40:12.840 align:middle line:84%
>>PURCE: So certain
languages mean

00:40:12.840 --> 00:40:16.500 align:middle line:84%
that we change the shape of
our mouth in certain ways,

00:40:16.500 --> 00:40:19.935 align:middle line:84%
and that affects just like you
look like your cat, you know,

00:40:19.935 --> 00:40:22.060 align:middle line:84%
because you are looking at
your cat the whole time.

00:40:22.060 --> 00:40:25.460 align:middle line:84%
So you look like the
language you're speaking.

00:40:25.460 --> 00:40:28.627 align:middle line:84%
But this is, course,
politically dodgy.

00:40:28.627 --> 00:40:30.210 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Yes it is
politically dodgy,

00:40:30.210 --> 00:40:31.770 align:middle line:90%
but that's OK on this show.

00:40:31.770 --> 00:40:34.290 align:middle line:84%
Our viewers are open minded,
thus the name Open Minds

00:40:34.290 --> 00:40:34.680 align:middle line:90%
for the show.

00:40:34.680 --> 00:40:36.429 align:middle line:84%
>>PURCE: So now I'm
very interested in how

00:40:36.429 --> 00:40:39.720 align:middle line:84%
we look like we speak and what
effect it has in our psyche

00:40:39.720 --> 00:40:42.962 align:middle line:90%
and on different cultures.

00:40:42.962 --> 00:40:45.420 align:middle line:84%
And I think that a lot more
research could be done on this.

00:40:45.420 --> 00:40:47.336 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: I think so too
because you see often

00:40:47.336 --> 00:40:50.650 align:middle line:84%
people who have more of a
nervous quality to them,

00:40:50.650 --> 00:40:53.400 align:middle line:84%
for example, you don't
hear a lot of vowels.

00:40:53.400 --> 00:40:56.790 align:middle line:84%
Everything seems to be locked
up in the throat, held back,

00:40:56.790 --> 00:40:59.460 align:middle line:84%
very edgy, more
consonant driven.

00:40:59.460 --> 00:41:03.180 align:middle line:84%
And I mean, I think there
it's the chicken or egg which

00:41:03.180 --> 00:41:04.260 align:middle line:90%
is affecting the other.

00:41:04.260 --> 00:41:04.730 align:middle line:90%
>>PURCE: Absolutely, yes.

00:41:04.730 --> 00:41:07.440 align:middle line:84%
Are we happy because we sing, or
do we sing because we're happy?

00:41:07.440 --> 00:41:08.640 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah, exactly.

00:41:08.640 --> 00:41:11.775 align:middle line:84%
So before we get into
a little bit of toning,

00:41:11.775 --> 00:41:13.150 align:middle line:84%
which you're going
to do for us--

00:41:13.150 --> 00:41:16.470 align:middle line:84%
and that will be interesting
for us to hear a pure tone if we

00:41:16.470 --> 00:41:18.870 align:middle line:90%
are not accustomed to it--

00:41:18.870 --> 00:41:22.050 align:middle line:84%
let's talk a little bit
about some of the effects.

00:41:22.050 --> 00:41:27.402 align:middle line:84%
And I love that you worked with
your family their entire lives.

00:41:27.402 --> 00:41:28.610 align:middle line:90%
You've worked with your sons.

00:41:28.610 --> 00:41:31.710 align:middle line:84%
You've helped them
pass examinations

00:41:31.710 --> 00:41:33.970 align:middle line:90%
and such through tone.

00:41:33.970 --> 00:41:35.350 align:middle line:90%
How does that work?

00:41:35.350 --> 00:41:36.150 align:middle line:90%
>>PURCE: Ooh.

00:41:36.150 --> 00:41:37.180 align:middle line:90%
Working with my family.

00:41:37.180 --> 00:41:37.980 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:41:37.980 --> 00:41:39.850 align:middle line:84%
>>PURCE: Well, I work
with families in general.

00:41:39.850 --> 00:41:41.320 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Yes, in
Family Constellations.

00:41:41.320 --> 00:41:42.570 align:middle line:84%
We have time to go
to that as well.

00:41:42.570 --> 00:41:43.400 align:middle line:90%
>>PURCE: Shall we do that?

00:41:43.400 --> 00:41:44.570 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah, go for it.

00:41:44.570 --> 00:41:47.040 align:middle line:84%
>>PURCE: So one of the
other aspects of my work

00:41:47.040 --> 00:41:52.050 align:middle line:84%
is working with
inherited traumas.

00:41:52.050 --> 00:41:56.250 align:middle line:84%
And so this is a very
interesting subject now

00:41:56.250 --> 00:41:59.730 align:middle line:84%
and is being
corroborated by science.

00:41:59.730 --> 00:42:03.450 align:middle line:10%
So I did a research
fellowship the early '70s

00:42:03.450 --> 00:42:07.560 align:middle line:10%
with Maurice Wilkins who got the
Nobel Prize for DNA with Watson

00:42:07.560 --> 00:42:08.790 align:middle line:10%
and Crick.

00:42:08.790 --> 00:42:11.730 align:middle line:84%
And at that point, everything
was considered genetic.

00:42:11.730 --> 00:42:12.810 align:middle line:90%
So--

00:42:12.810 --> 00:42:13.610 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:42:13.610 --> 00:42:17.550 align:middle line:84%
>>PURCE: You couldn't talk
about Lysenko or anybody

00:42:17.550 --> 00:42:20.280 align:middle line:84%
who-- even Darwin
felt that you could

00:42:20.280 --> 00:42:23.856 align:middle line:84%
inherit acquired characters,
and Lamarck, and so on.

00:42:23.856 --> 00:42:25.230 align:middle line:84%
So now it's all
very fashionable.

00:42:25.230 --> 00:42:27.030 align:middle line:84%
The most fashionable
area of science

00:42:27.030 --> 00:42:29.880 align:middle line:84%
is epigenetics, which means
the inheritance of that

00:42:29.880 --> 00:42:32.320 align:middle line:90%
which is not through the DNA.

00:42:32.320 --> 00:42:36.720 align:middle line:84%
And so the work with families,
which I also do with sound,

00:42:36.720 --> 00:42:38.490 align:middle line:90%
is about interruption.

00:42:38.490 --> 00:42:40.800 align:middle line:84%
So if going back
two generations,

00:42:40.800 --> 00:42:43.290 align:middle line:84%
you have any kind
of an interruption

00:42:43.290 --> 00:42:46.680 align:middle line:84%
to what might be considered
a flowering of a life-- so

00:42:46.680 --> 00:42:51.450 align:middle line:84%
early death, suicide,
mental illness, emigration,

00:42:51.450 --> 00:42:57.000 align:middle line:84%
incarceration, dodgy dealing,
injustices, abortions,

00:42:57.000 --> 00:42:59.280 align:middle line:84%
giving children up for
adoption, or being given up

00:42:59.280 --> 00:43:03.780 align:middle line:84%
for adoption, anything
which interrupts

00:43:03.780 --> 00:43:07.790 align:middle line:84%
the normal notion of
what a life might be

00:43:07.790 --> 00:43:12.280 align:middle line:84%
causes a stable pattern
of trauma in the field.

00:43:12.280 --> 00:43:15.540 align:middle line:84%
And this, then, goes down
through the generations,

00:43:15.540 --> 00:43:20.010 align:middle line:84%
and it seems to attract
somebody in every generation who

00:43:20.010 --> 00:43:24.070 align:middle line:84%
seems to relate, usually
without even knowing,

00:43:24.070 --> 00:43:26.370 align:middle line:84%
to what happened to
the earlier person.

00:43:26.370 --> 00:43:30.660 align:middle line:84%
So they find themselves
being excluded, or pushed

00:43:30.660 --> 00:43:33.300 align:middle line:84%
outside the system or
the family in some way,

00:43:33.300 --> 00:43:37.290 align:middle line:84%
or even following exactly
what the earlier person had

00:43:37.290 --> 00:43:38.604 align:middle line:90%
done or has happened to them.

00:43:38.604 --> 00:43:39.770 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: It's in the field.

00:43:39.770 --> 00:43:40.480 align:middle line:90%
>>PURCE: It's in the field.

00:43:40.480 --> 00:43:42.430 align:middle line:84%
It's in the family
and ancestral field.

00:43:42.430 --> 00:43:43.230 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:43:43.230 --> 00:43:48.210 align:middle line:84%
>>PURCE: And so what's really
interesting that these people

00:43:48.210 --> 00:43:52.230 align:middle line:84%
to whom who are
vulnerable to this are--

00:43:52.230 --> 00:43:54.090 align:middle line:84%
in a way, it's the
curse and the blessing.

00:43:54.090 --> 00:43:57.970 align:middle line:84%
So they are the ones that find
themselves outside the system.

00:43:57.970 --> 00:44:01.020 align:middle line:84%
But at the same time, they are
the only ones that can heal it.

00:44:01.020 --> 00:44:03.610 align:middle line:90%
And so this is the blessing.

00:44:03.610 --> 00:44:09.030 align:middle line:84%
And so what the work
involves is having

00:44:09.030 --> 00:44:13.650 align:middle line:84%
people choose people to
represent their family members

00:44:13.650 --> 00:44:18.930 align:middle line:84%
and to then place them in
some kind of a tableau, which

00:44:18.930 --> 00:44:21.220 align:middle line:84%
represents the
dynamics between them.

00:44:21.220 --> 00:44:23.430 align:middle line:84%
And then, the work
begins to unfold.

00:44:23.430 --> 00:44:26.520 align:middle line:84%
And in this way,
you see the families

00:44:26.520 --> 00:44:30.760 align:middle line:84%
through the eyes of different
members and through time.

00:44:30.760 --> 00:44:36.930 align:middle line:84%
So normally, we see our family
through a very narrow window

00:44:36.930 --> 00:44:40.980 align:middle line:84%
of were we loved, were we
not loved, were we loved more

00:44:40.980 --> 00:44:44.250 align:middle line:84%
or less than our siblings, or
were we good enough, or were we

00:44:44.250 --> 00:44:45.750 align:middle line:90%
not, and that's it.

00:44:45.750 --> 00:44:48.120 align:middle line:84%
So this way we see the
family through the eyes

00:44:48.120 --> 00:44:49.390 align:middle line:90%
of all members.

00:44:49.390 --> 00:44:52.410 align:middle line:84%
We see the family through
time, and we see it

00:44:52.410 --> 00:44:54.540 align:middle line:84%
through what happened and
through interruptions,

00:44:54.540 --> 00:44:57.570 align:middle line:84%
which are normally something
we don't really know about.

00:44:57.570 --> 00:44:59.700 align:middle line:90%
And this changes everything.

00:44:59.700 --> 00:45:04.380 align:middle line:84%
And so what I have found is
that it's really important

00:45:04.380 --> 00:45:07.770 align:middle line:84%
to acknowledge previous
members of the family, which

00:45:07.770 --> 00:45:09.520 align:middle line:90%
we call ancestors.

00:45:09.520 --> 00:45:12.990 align:middle line:84%
So in other cultures, ancestors
are completely central.

00:45:12.990 --> 00:45:16.950 align:middle line:84%
So in traditional culture,
especially in the Far East,

00:45:16.950 --> 00:45:22.080 align:middle line:84%
it's the only way that the
ongoing harmonious development

00:45:22.080 --> 00:45:26.680 align:middle line:84%
of the family can happen is by
acknowledging the ancestors.

00:45:26.680 --> 00:45:29.640 align:middle line:84%
So in every family when I was
in Japan in the early '80s,

00:45:29.640 --> 00:45:32.034 align:middle line:84%
every family had
an ancestral altar

00:45:32.034 --> 00:45:33.450 align:middle line:84%
which was acknowledged
every day--

00:45:33.450 --> 00:45:36.000 align:middle line:90%
fresh rice, fresh alcohol.

00:45:36.000 --> 00:45:39.180 align:middle line:84%
Offerings would be
made to the previous--

00:45:39.180 --> 00:45:42.790 align:middle line:84%
well, it was patriarchal--
so the head of the family.

00:45:42.790 --> 00:45:44.540 align:middle line:84%
Nowadays when I ask
Japanese people,

00:45:44.540 --> 00:45:46.860 align:middle line:84%
they say, oh, my
grandmother still has one.

00:45:46.860 --> 00:45:48.900 align:middle line:90%
So it's dying.

00:45:48.900 --> 00:45:51.240 align:middle line:84%
But what I found
is that ancestors

00:45:51.240 --> 00:45:53.190 align:middle line:84%
have a job description,
which is to help

00:45:53.190 --> 00:45:56.720 align:middle line:90%
the living remain alive.

00:45:56.720 --> 00:46:01.460 align:middle line:84%
But they have no agency unless
the living acknowledge them.

00:46:01.460 --> 00:46:04.460 align:middle line:84%
And until that happens,
it's like they're

00:46:04.460 --> 00:46:07.920 align:middle line:84%
clamorous children trying to
get our attention by putting out

00:46:07.920 --> 00:46:12.870 align:middle line:84%
a foot to trip us up, as
if to say, please open

00:46:12.870 --> 00:46:16.770 align:middle line:84%
these channels of transmission,
so we can keep you alive.

00:46:16.770 --> 00:46:18.990 align:middle line:84%
And then as soon as you
acknowledge the ancestors,

00:46:18.990 --> 00:46:22.770 align:middle line:84%
as soon as you honor
the ancestors, then

00:46:22.770 --> 00:46:23.570 align:middle line:90%
they're on board.

00:46:23.570 --> 00:46:26.620 align:middle line:84%
Then, they can help us, and they
stop being irritating clamorous

00:46:26.620 --> 00:46:27.420 align:middle line:90%
children.

00:46:27.420 --> 00:46:28.860 align:middle line:90%
They stop trying to trip us up.

00:46:28.860 --> 00:46:31.470 align:middle line:84%
And then things
that we aspired to,

00:46:31.470 --> 00:46:33.330 align:middle line:84%
things that we have
not even realized

00:46:33.330 --> 00:46:35.760 align:middle line:90%
we wanted to do start flowing.

00:46:35.760 --> 00:46:38.790 align:middle line:84%
Things that we would
like to happen,

00:46:38.790 --> 00:46:40.950 align:middle line:84%
even if we didn't know
we wanted them to happen,

00:46:40.950 --> 00:46:41.430 align:middle line:90%
start happening.

00:46:41.430 --> 00:46:43.055 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Is it almost
as though you're

00:46:43.055 --> 00:46:45.120 align:middle line:84%
going back and
re-patterning past?

00:46:45.120 --> 00:46:47.800 align:middle line:84%
If time and space
are non-linear,

00:46:47.800 --> 00:46:50.480 align:middle line:84%
that through this work,
through toning and such,

00:46:50.480 --> 00:46:52.230 align:middle line:84%
you're reconnecting
with and re-patterning

00:46:52.230 --> 00:46:55.620 align:middle line:84%
what happened to make an easier
flow of that ancestral energy

00:46:55.620 --> 00:46:56.567 align:middle line:90%
through you now.

00:46:56.567 --> 00:46:57.400 align:middle line:90%
>>PURCE: Absolutely.

00:46:57.400 --> 00:47:00.830 align:middle line:84%
We're working in the present to
change the past and the future

00:47:00.830 --> 00:47:03.530 align:middle line:84%
so that these things don't
go down through our families.

00:47:03.530 --> 00:47:05.637 align:middle line:84%
So often, people come
and say, well, I'm

00:47:05.637 --> 00:47:07.470 align:middle line:84%
really aware of this
and that and the other,

00:47:07.470 --> 00:47:09.740 align:middle line:84%
and I don't want to pass
it on to my children.

00:47:09.740 --> 00:47:10.610 align:middle line:90%
But of course we do.

00:47:10.610 --> 00:47:13.350 align:middle line:84%
We pass all these
dysfunctional patterns

00:47:13.350 --> 00:47:15.990 align:middle line:84%
we pass on to our
children simply because we

00:47:15.990 --> 00:47:18.390 align:middle line:84%
have no other way of
being other than the way

00:47:18.390 --> 00:47:20.100 align:middle line:84%
that we have received
and resonated

00:47:20.100 --> 00:47:23.490 align:middle line:84%
with our previous
parents and grandparents.

00:47:23.490 --> 00:47:25.620 align:middle line:84%
So we then turn and
face our children

00:47:25.620 --> 00:47:28.000 align:middle line:84%
and then pattern
them in the same way.

00:47:28.000 --> 00:47:30.300 align:middle line:84%
So this is the only
way we can interrupt

00:47:30.300 --> 00:47:34.320 align:middle line:84%
these dysfunctional patterns,
these negative patterns,

00:47:34.320 --> 00:47:37.036 align:middle line:84%
that we've received in order
that we don't pass them on.

00:47:37.036 --> 00:47:39.160 align:middle line:84%
And we have a responsibility
to get you to do that.

00:47:39.160 --> 00:47:40.240 align:middle line:90%
It's our job.

00:47:40.240 --> 00:47:42.370 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Yes it is,
very interesting.

00:47:42.370 --> 00:47:45.100 align:middle line:84%
On a life giving notion, there
are a couple of other areas

00:47:45.100 --> 00:47:48.880 align:middle line:84%
I found fascinating, and
that was toning and using

00:47:48.880 --> 00:47:51.520 align:middle line:84%
sound for the
development of seed stock

00:47:51.520 --> 00:47:54.550 align:middle line:90%
for example, little seedlings.

00:47:54.550 --> 00:47:55.510 align:middle line:90%
>>PURCE: Yeah.

00:47:55.510 --> 00:47:56.885 align:middle line:84%
Well, there have
been many people

00:47:56.885 --> 00:47:59.590 align:middle line:84%
over the years who have
used sound to chant

00:47:59.590 --> 00:48:05.690 align:middle line:84%
to plants in order to encourage
growth of different kinds.

00:48:05.690 --> 00:48:08.350 align:middle line:84%
People in India, and
this is certainly

00:48:08.350 --> 00:48:10.050 align:middle line:84%
something that's
happened all over.

00:48:10.050 --> 00:48:12.500 align:middle line:84%
And playing music to
plants, of course,

00:48:12.500 --> 00:48:14.710 align:middle line:84%
they find that they like
Mozart, and they like this,

00:48:14.710 --> 00:48:15.780 align:middle line:90%
and they don't like this.

00:48:15.780 --> 00:48:17.500 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Baxter's
work is beautiful.

00:48:17.500 --> 00:48:18.750 align:middle line:90%
[INTERPOSING VOICES]

00:48:18.750 --> 00:48:20.270 align:middle line:90%
>>PURCE: One of the earlier--

00:48:20.270 --> 00:48:20.740 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:48:20.740 --> 00:48:21.730 align:middle line:90%

00:48:21.730 --> 00:48:22.690 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Absolutely.

00:48:22.690 --> 00:48:25.610 align:middle line:84%
And then let's go back to your
sons, and singing, and tone,

00:48:25.610 --> 00:48:27.320 align:middle line:90%
and helping them pass exams.

00:48:27.320 --> 00:48:29.860 align:middle line:84%
I think people find this
very practical and useful

00:48:29.860 --> 00:48:32.317 align:middle line:84%
if we can find a pure
note within ourselves.

00:48:32.317 --> 00:48:34.150 align:middle line:84%
>>PURCE: Well, there
are lots of reasons why

00:48:34.150 --> 00:48:35.690 align:middle line:90%
the boys passed exams, really.

00:48:35.690 --> 00:48:38.140 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Well, they're smart.

00:48:38.140 --> 00:48:39.610 align:middle line:90%
>>PURCE: That's true, yes.

00:48:39.610 --> 00:48:43.630 align:middle line:84%
And of course, Merlin, our
eldest son, discovered,

00:48:43.630 --> 00:48:49.330 align:middle line:84%
took my husband's
theory and the idea

00:48:49.330 --> 00:48:51.070 align:middle line:84%
that the more something
has been done,

00:48:51.070 --> 00:48:53.230 align:middle line:90%
the easier it becomes to do.

00:48:53.230 --> 00:48:56.230 align:middle line:84%
So he and his
colleagues got together

00:48:56.230 --> 00:49:01.030 align:middle line:84%
in A levels, which is our
senior exam, at school

00:49:01.030 --> 00:49:05.050 align:middle line:84%
and decided to answer
the later questions first

00:49:05.050 --> 00:49:08.672 align:middle line:84%
because more people will
have done those questions.

00:49:08.672 --> 00:49:10.630 align:middle line:84%
And then they'd come back
to the first question

00:49:10.630 --> 00:49:13.570 align:middle line:84%
because more people will
have done those, rather,

00:49:13.570 --> 00:49:16.180 align:middle line:84%
so that the more people have
done the first questions will

00:49:16.180 --> 00:49:18.880 align:middle line:84%
mean it's easier for
them to get them right.

00:49:18.880 --> 00:49:20.617 align:middle line:90%
And they'll do terribly well.

00:49:20.617 --> 00:49:21.450 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Brilliant.

00:49:21.450 --> 00:49:23.530 align:middle line:90%
Oh I absolutely love it.

both do, but do your children?

00:49:27.803 --> 00:49:30.980 align:middle line:84%
>>PURCE: They do, and
our son Cosmo is now--

00:49:30.980 --> 00:49:33.760 align:middle line:84%
Cosmo Sheldrick-- is a
very well-known musician

00:49:33.760 --> 00:49:38.110 align:middle line:84%
and uses his voice,
and absolutely.

00:49:38.110 --> 00:49:39.160 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:49:39.160 --> 00:49:39.570 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: I love it.

00:49:39.570 --> 00:49:41.153 align:middle line:84%
I'm going to ask you
a little bit more

00:49:41.153 --> 00:49:43.300 align:middle line:84%
about some family stuff
going on at the very end.

00:49:43.300 --> 00:49:45.440 align:middle line:84%
We have a little
bit of time left,

00:49:45.440 --> 00:49:48.730 align:middle line:84%
and I wanted to talk to you
about the notion of using--

00:49:48.730 --> 00:49:50.700 align:middle line:84%
we talked about trauma
a couple of times--

00:49:50.700 --> 00:49:54.430 align:middle line:84%
but the notion of using
chanting through the process

00:49:54.430 --> 00:49:58.570 align:middle line:84%
of transition or death and
what this does, how this

00:49:58.570 --> 00:50:01.150 align:middle line:84%
is utilized, what it
does to the being who

00:50:01.150 --> 00:50:02.920 align:middle line:90%
is leaving this reality.

00:50:02.920 --> 00:50:06.460 align:middle line:84%
>>PURCE: There are so many
stories about sound in relation

00:50:06.460 --> 00:50:10.240 align:middle line:84%
to the passage, to death,
and choirs of angels.

00:50:10.240 --> 00:50:12.010 align:middle line:84%
I mean the interesting
thing about angels

00:50:12.010 --> 00:50:14.710 align:middle line:84%
is they don't come
in herds or packs.

00:50:14.710 --> 00:50:16.260 align:middle line:90%
They come in choirs.

00:50:16.260 --> 00:50:19.990 align:middle line:84%
So by very definition, their
whole nature is sonorous.

00:50:19.990 --> 00:50:24.580 align:middle line:84%
And the fact, I see them as
personified representations

00:50:24.580 --> 00:50:28.180 align:middle line:84%
of vibratory levels of
existence that exist

00:50:28.180 --> 00:50:30.310 align:middle line:90%
between the divine and us.

00:50:30.310 --> 00:50:33.750 align:middle line:84%
And in the Neoplatonic
tradition, a little bit of God

00:50:33.750 --> 00:50:36.220 align:middle line:84%
separates out, a little
bit of the soul substance

00:50:36.220 --> 00:50:39.010 align:middle line:84%
separates out from God and comes
down through the great chain

00:50:39.010 --> 00:50:42.190 align:middle line:84%
of being, finally through
the angels, the cherubim

00:50:42.190 --> 00:50:47.380 align:middle line:84%
and seraphim, and then comes
down to us through the elements

00:50:47.380 --> 00:50:48.730 align:middle line:90%
into a human being.

00:50:48.730 --> 00:50:51.760 align:middle line:84%
And then at the moment of
death, that separates out

00:50:51.760 --> 00:50:54.400 align:middle line:84%
and goes back through
the music of the spheres,

00:50:54.400 --> 00:50:58.000 align:middle line:84%
and we drop off all our
psychological blockages,

00:50:58.000 --> 00:51:02.670 align:middle line:84%
and configurations, and
return to the divine.

00:51:02.670 --> 00:51:05.500 align:middle line:84%
And Plato describes how
sitting on each of the spheres

00:51:05.500 --> 00:51:09.610 align:middle line:84%
is a musical being, a
bird-like creature, a siren,

00:51:09.610 --> 00:51:11.170 align:middle line:90%
uttering a different note.

00:51:11.170 --> 00:51:12.640 align:middle line:90%
So this passage between--

00:51:12.640 --> 00:51:16.190 align:middle line:84%
and they're called the
soul guides, psychopomps.

00:51:16.190 --> 00:51:20.140 align:middle line:84%
So in many traditions, this
journey between the worlds

00:51:20.140 --> 00:51:22.330 align:middle line:84%
has been described as
a sonorous one, both

00:51:22.330 --> 00:51:25.150 align:middle line:90%
coming in and going out.

00:51:25.150 --> 00:51:30.030 align:middle line:84%
And so in one of the things
I do are extended ceremonies.

00:51:30.030 --> 00:51:33.990 align:middle line:84%
I realize that it's important
not just to teach methods

00:51:33.990 --> 00:51:37.530 align:middle line:84%
of chanting in order to have
them as tools to overcome

00:51:37.530 --> 00:51:40.260 align:middle line:84%
separation, to get into
deep states of meditation,

00:51:40.260 --> 00:51:41.470 align:middle line:90%
and so on.

00:51:41.470 --> 00:51:43.410 align:middle line:84%
But actually to
provide situations

00:51:43.410 --> 00:51:46.260 align:middle line:84%
where people can,
for extended periods,

00:51:46.260 --> 00:51:49.660 align:middle line:84%
realize what happens
when you really do this.

00:51:49.660 --> 00:51:53.310 align:middle line:84%
And when you were
ceremonially, the key there

00:51:53.310 --> 00:51:54.440 align:middle line:90%
is that you have a witness.

00:51:54.440 --> 00:51:56.790 align:middle line:84%
So when you want to
change ourselves--

00:51:56.790 --> 00:51:59.400 align:middle line:84%
so people come to my workshops
because they think they could

00:51:59.400 --> 00:52:01.720 align:middle line:84%
be better, or kinder,
or more compassionate,

00:52:01.720 --> 00:52:03.189 align:middle line:90%
or develop their consciousness.

00:52:03.189 --> 00:52:04.980 align:middle line:84%
But then, they go home
and then the default

00:52:04.980 --> 00:52:08.100 align:middle line:84%
them sets in because
that's the them they always

00:52:08.100 --> 00:52:09.600 align:middle line:90%
know up to then.

00:52:09.600 --> 00:52:12.880 align:middle line:84%
So how do you sustain
the changes that happen?

00:52:12.880 --> 00:52:17.490 align:middle line:84%
And so what I found is that in
order to sustain the changes,

00:52:17.490 --> 00:52:18.600 align:middle line:90%
you need a witness.

00:52:18.600 --> 00:52:20.940 align:middle line:84%
And that's why if you
get married, for example,

00:52:20.940 --> 00:52:24.940 align:middle line:84%
traditionally, you have somebody
who signs a document and says,

00:52:24.940 --> 00:52:26.190 align:middle line:90%
I was here.

00:52:26.190 --> 00:52:29.430 align:middle line:84%
I saw, and I signed
this to say I was here,

00:52:29.430 --> 00:52:31.980 align:middle line:84%
which means that you
are now recognized

00:52:31.980 --> 00:52:33.450 align:middle line:90%
as being no longer unmarried.

00:52:33.450 --> 00:52:35.280 align:middle line:90%
You are now married.

00:52:35.280 --> 00:52:37.710 align:middle line:84%
And then you invite all your
friends and your families

00:52:37.710 --> 00:52:39.220 align:middle line:90%
to witness all those.

00:52:39.220 --> 00:52:41.280 align:middle line:84%
So nowadays, people have
destination weddings.

00:52:41.280 --> 00:52:43.925 align:middle line:84%
They go to exotic places
and get married underwater,

00:52:43.925 --> 00:52:45.300 align:middle line:84%
come back, and
tell their friends

00:52:45.300 --> 00:52:47.040 align:middle line:84%
and say, oh, by the
way we're married.

00:52:47.040 --> 00:52:48.059 align:middle line:90%
And they say, oh really?

00:52:48.059 --> 00:52:49.600 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: It was
already on Facebook.

00:52:49.600 --> 00:52:50.400 align:middle line:90%
So it's OK.

00:52:50.400 --> 00:52:51.940 align:middle line:90%
They're aware.

00:52:51.940 --> 00:52:52.900 align:middle line:90%
>>PURCE: Absolutely.

00:52:52.900 --> 00:52:55.050 align:middle line:84%
But the point about
the ceremonies

00:52:55.050 --> 00:52:57.860 align:middle line:84%
is that you have people
there as witnesses

00:52:57.860 --> 00:52:59.142 align:middle line:90%
so that there's no going back.

00:52:59.142 --> 00:53:00.600 align:middle line:84%
So you know that
they know that you

00:53:00.600 --> 00:53:03.280 align:middle line:84%
know that they know that
they're now no longer unmarried.

00:53:03.280 --> 00:53:04.080 align:middle line:90%
They're married.

00:53:04.080 --> 00:53:08.130 align:middle line:84%
And so they sustains them
in the new state of being,

00:53:08.130 --> 00:53:09.220 align:middle line:90%
and this is really key.

00:53:09.220 --> 00:53:12.720 align:middle line:84%
So in terms of working, I
find that working ceremonially

00:53:12.720 --> 00:53:14.310 align:middle line:84%
is essential for
this because then you

00:53:14.310 --> 00:53:17.330 align:middle line:84%
have all the people
witnessing your change.

00:53:17.330 --> 00:53:21.690 align:middle line:84%
And so I do these very
extended ceremonies.

00:53:21.690 --> 00:53:28.370 align:middle line:84%
And two of the ones that I do
working with Tibetan practice

00:53:28.370 --> 00:53:29.870 align:middle line:90%
of conscious dying.

00:53:29.870 --> 00:53:31.690 align:middle line:84%
So this October,
I have one where

00:53:31.690 --> 00:53:34.330 align:middle line:84%
I will be working with a
particular practice called

00:53:34.330 --> 00:53:36.810 align:middle line:84%
the poa where you shoot
your consciousness out

00:53:36.810 --> 00:53:39.270 align:middle line:84%
of your head at
the moment of death

00:53:39.270 --> 00:53:43.116 align:middle line:84%
and direct it so you don't
find yourself in some--

00:53:43.116 --> 00:53:44.490 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Lost in
some Bardo way.

00:53:44.490 --> 00:53:45.290 align:middle line:90%
>>PURCE: Exactly.

00:53:45.290 --> 00:53:46.200 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:53:46.200 --> 00:53:46.890 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Interesting.

00:53:46.890 --> 00:53:48.890 align:middle line:84%
>>PURCE: This is very
important part of my work.

00:53:48.890 --> 00:53:51.600 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So give
us a sample of what

00:53:51.600 --> 00:53:56.070 align:middle line:84%
toning is like and
overtoning, and you're just

00:53:56.070 --> 00:53:57.370 align:middle line:90%
recovering from a cold.

00:53:57.370 --> 00:54:00.450 align:middle line:84%
So if you're a little squeaky,
then we'll just forgive you,

00:54:00.450 --> 00:54:02.000 align:middle line:90%
or we'll stop it, OK?

00:54:02.000 --> 00:54:03.030 align:middle line:90%
>>PURCE: OK.

00:54:03.030 --> 00:54:05.280 align:middle line:84%
So I'm just going to
make a sound on one note,

00:54:05.280 --> 00:54:08.250 align:middle line:84%
and then I'll maybe
indicate with my hands

00:54:08.250 --> 00:54:10.281 align:middle line:84%
other sounds that
should be audible.

00:54:10.281 --> 00:54:11.081 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:54:11.081 --> 00:54:15.009 align:middle line:90%
>>PURCE: [TONING]

00:54:15.009 --> 00:54:39.342 align:middle line:90%


00:54:39.342 --> 00:54:40.800 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: You can
hear all of them.

00:54:40.800 --> 00:54:41.440 align:middle line:90%
>>PURCE: Good.

00:54:41.440 --> 00:54:42.850 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Yes, you
can hear all of them.

00:54:42.850 --> 00:54:44.440 align:middle line:84%
But it's all within
the same note.

00:54:44.440 --> 00:54:47.200 align:middle line:84%
>>PURCE: So I was
just making one note.

00:54:47.200 --> 00:54:49.660 align:middle line:84%
And the rest were
harmonics, which

00:54:49.660 --> 00:54:52.600 align:middle line:84%
come about through changing the
shape of the resonant cavity.

00:54:52.600 --> 00:54:53.900 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes, at the mouth.

00:54:53.900 --> 00:54:54.700 align:middle line:90%
Right.

00:54:54.700 --> 00:54:55.540 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:54:55.540 --> 00:54:58.090 align:middle line:84%
So let's talk about
for our viewers

00:54:58.090 --> 00:55:00.280 align:middle line:84%
now, who are by
this time absolutely

00:55:00.280 --> 00:55:03.190 align:middle line:84%
fascinated and absolutely know
they have to start singing

00:55:03.190 --> 00:55:06.040 align:middle line:84%
at least in the shower
if nowhere else,

00:55:06.040 --> 00:55:09.730 align:middle line:84%
how you find A, your pure tone,
and a couple of techniques

00:55:09.730 --> 00:55:12.790 align:middle line:84%
that, for meditation,
for example, that really

00:55:12.790 --> 00:55:14.696 align:middle line:84%
take you deep,
that you find work

00:55:14.696 --> 00:55:15.820 align:middle line:90%
with your groups of people.

00:55:15.820 --> 00:55:19.499 align:middle line:84%
Maybe it's a little mantra, a
little chant, a certain tone.

00:55:19.499 --> 00:55:21.040 align:middle line:84%
Maybe share a couple
of those with us

00:55:21.040 --> 00:55:22.700 align:middle line:90%
so we have some takeaways.

00:55:22.700 --> 00:55:25.540 align:middle line:84%
>>PURCE: So I think on
a very simple level,

00:55:25.540 --> 00:55:28.300 align:middle line:84%
the simplest level of all
is humming and listening

00:55:28.300 --> 00:55:30.040 align:middle line:90%
to yourself humming.

00:55:30.040 --> 00:55:33.610 align:middle line:84%
So just making a continuous
sound on one note,

00:55:33.610 --> 00:55:38.230 align:middle line:84%
and all the time that
you're making that sound,

00:55:38.230 --> 00:55:41.110 align:middle line:84%
allowing it to be
integrated with the vessel

00:55:41.110 --> 00:55:42.470 align:middle line:90%
of your hearing.

00:55:42.470 --> 00:55:44.860 align:middle line:84%
So there is no moment
when you're not

00:55:44.860 --> 00:55:50.140 align:middle line:84%
hearing through this intracative
listening, not judging good,

00:55:50.140 --> 00:55:55.030 align:middle line:84%
bad sound, not right
sound, but just listening

00:55:55.030 --> 00:55:58.330 align:middle line:84%
and through your hearing
attention integrating

00:55:58.330 --> 00:56:01.990 align:middle line:84%
with the continuity of the
sound-stream within the sound.

00:56:01.990 --> 00:56:06.070 align:middle line:84%
So letting it be continuous
and continuously listening.

00:56:06.070 --> 00:56:08.020 align:middle line:84%
And when you realize
you've forgotten

00:56:08.020 --> 00:56:12.250 align:middle line:84%
to listen, come back and
maintain that listening.

00:56:12.250 --> 00:56:15.700 align:middle line:84%
And that in itself is a
really profound practice

00:56:15.700 --> 00:56:16.840 align:middle line:90%
as long as you can go on.

00:56:16.840 --> 00:56:18.340 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Doesn't
matter which note?

00:56:18.340 --> 00:56:19.540 align:middle line:84%
>>PURCE: Doesn't
matter which you note.

00:56:19.540 --> 00:56:20.340 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: OK.

00:56:20.340 --> 00:56:22.930 align:middle line:84%
>>PURCE: Although, if you do
too high, you'll get exhausted.

00:56:22.930 --> 00:56:24.592 align:middle line:84%
If you do it too
low, you'll waver.

00:56:24.592 --> 00:56:26.550 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So find your
comfortable middle zone.

00:56:26.550 --> 00:56:27.220 align:middle line:90%
>>PURCE: Find a comfortable--

00:56:27.220 --> 00:56:29.678 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Doesn't matter if
it's major, minor, nothing else

00:56:29.678 --> 00:56:31.120 align:middle line:90%
matters.

00:56:31.120 --> 00:56:33.490 align:middle line:84%
In tune or out of tune,
it doesn't matter.

00:56:33.490 --> 00:56:35.480 align:middle line:84%
>>PURCE: No because
sound is relative.

00:56:35.480 --> 00:56:38.310 align:middle line:84%
So if you've got one note,
it's never out of tune.

00:56:38.310 --> 00:56:40.210 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Right,
right, there you go.

00:56:40.210 --> 00:56:41.080 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:56:41.080 --> 00:56:45.070 align:middle line:84%
And then something that takes--
unless the answer is the same--

00:56:45.070 --> 00:56:48.040 align:middle line:84%
something that takes you
really deep in preparation

00:56:48.040 --> 00:56:49.870 align:middle line:90%
for a deep meditation.

00:56:49.870 --> 00:56:53.250 align:middle line:84%
>>PURCE: Well, I
think this is it.

00:56:53.250 --> 00:56:55.827 align:middle line:84%
So whenever you're going
to do a deep meditation,

00:56:55.827 --> 00:56:57.910 align:middle line:84%
you start with the most
energetic form of practice

00:56:57.910 --> 00:57:00.490 align:middle line:84%
first, so the more
vigorous and then you

00:57:00.490 --> 00:57:04.360 align:middle line:84%
get less and less until
you're contemplative.

00:57:04.360 --> 00:57:08.090 align:middle line:84%
So I would say that this kind
of challenge is very good.

00:57:08.090 --> 00:57:10.640 align:middle line:84%
And then you can also begin
to articulate the vowels.

00:57:10.640 --> 00:57:13.690 align:middle line:84%
So if you want to bring in
the elements of the harmonics,

00:57:13.690 --> 00:57:17.500 align:middle line:84%
so you could make a
sort of cave-like mouth,

00:57:17.500 --> 00:57:20.780 align:middle line:84%
for example, containing
mouth, not completely closed,

00:57:20.780 --> 00:57:23.830 align:middle line:84%
big inside, round,
stretched, but round,

00:57:23.830 --> 00:57:25.180 align:middle line:90%
and open at the front.

00:57:25.180 --> 00:57:28.830 align:middle line:84%
And then begin to
articulate the vowels.

00:57:28.830 --> 00:57:31.690 align:middle line:84%
So move from one vowel
to another seamlessly

00:57:31.690 --> 00:57:35.200 align:middle line:84%
and really extending the
transitions between the vowels.

00:57:35.200 --> 00:57:37.240 align:middle line:84%
You can give yourself
Mickey Mouse ears,

00:57:37.240 --> 00:57:39.580 align:middle line:84%
so you can hear more
what's happening inside.

00:57:39.580 --> 00:57:42.310 align:middle line:84%
But extending the
transitions because it's

00:57:42.310 --> 00:57:44.440 align:middle line:84%
in the transitions that
we hear the harmonics,

00:57:44.440 --> 00:57:46.590 align:middle line:90%
that we hear the changes.

00:57:46.590 --> 00:57:48.610 align:middle line:90%
And again, always listening.

00:57:48.610 --> 00:57:52.120 align:middle line:84%
Always listening to the
sounds that you're making.

00:57:52.120 --> 00:57:53.530 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes, beautiful.

00:57:53.530 --> 00:57:56.410 align:middle line:84%
Thank you for those
very practical words.

00:57:56.410 --> 00:57:58.219 align:middle line:84%
And then before
we sign off here,

00:57:58.219 --> 00:58:00.010 align:middle line:84%
I just wanted to say
you have an incredibly

00:58:00.010 --> 00:58:01.630 align:middle line:90%
productive little family.

00:58:01.630 --> 00:58:03.520 align:middle line:84%
As you already mentioned,
Cosmo is really

00:58:03.520 --> 00:58:06.220 align:middle line:84%
making it on the music
scene doing amazing music.

00:58:06.220 --> 00:58:08.920 align:middle line:84%
And your other son Merlin
is following in his

00:58:08.920 --> 00:58:11.260 align:middle line:84%
dad's footsteps, and he's
actually going into it--

00:58:11.260 --> 00:58:14.300 align:middle line:84%
and you say in a very
irreverent, but amazing way--

00:58:14.300 --> 00:58:20.050 align:middle line:84%
into the study of the world of
fungus, the interconnectedness

00:58:20.050 --> 00:58:21.040 align:middle line:90%
and intelligence.

00:58:21.040 --> 00:58:23.150 align:middle line:90%
And that book's due out before?

00:58:23.150 --> 00:58:24.600 align:middle line:90%
Well, maybe within the year?

00:58:24.600 --> 00:58:25.600 align:middle line:90%
>>PURCE: Well, maybe.

00:58:25.600 --> 00:58:26.910 align:middle line:90%
I think probably not.

00:58:26.910 --> 00:58:27.710 align:middle line:90%
I think--

00:58:27.710 --> 00:58:28.750 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: It's still
a little longer.

00:58:28.750 --> 00:58:29.170 align:middle line:90%
>>PURCE: Yes.

00:58:29.170 --> 00:58:31.780 align:middle line:10%
>>PURCE: But we'll look out for
Merlin Sheldrake and his work.

00:58:31.780 --> 00:58:32.230 align:middle line:10%
>>PURCE: Yes.

00:58:32.230 --> 00:58:33.813 align:middle line:10%
