00:00:03.437 --> 00:00:21.150 align:middle line:90%


00:00:21.150 --> 00:00:23.900 align:middle line:10%
As children, many of us were
drawn to stories and films

00:00:23.900 --> 00:00:27.300 align:middle line:10%
about animals who could talk
to us and be our best friends.

00:00:27.300 --> 00:00:29.300 align:middle line:10%
Some kids took it
a little further.

00:00:29.300 --> 00:00:32.670 align:middle line:84%
As a little girl, Linda Bender
rescued animals of all sorts,

00:00:32.670 --> 00:00:35.480 align:middle line:84%
and developed the ability to
understand their thoughts.

00:00:35.480 --> 00:00:38.190 align:middle line:84%
It's no surprise she chose the
field of veterinary medicine

00:00:38.190 --> 00:00:39.520 align:middle line:90%
as her profession.

00:00:39.520 --> 00:00:41.880 align:middle line:84%
This has taken her to
wild animal refuges

00:00:41.880 --> 00:00:44.010 align:middle line:84%
around the world,
and into the minds

00:00:44.010 --> 00:00:46.200 align:middle line:90%
of our companion dogs and cats.

00:00:46.200 --> 00:00:49.980 align:middle line:84%
She's with us today to share her
unique perspective on the magic

00:00:49.980 --> 00:00:52.010 align:middle line:90%
of living alongside animals.

00:00:52.010 --> 00:00:52.910 align:middle line:90%
I'm so happy.

00:00:52.910 --> 00:00:55.921 align:middle line:84%
I've been dying to talk to you,
because I too love animals.

00:00:55.921 --> 00:00:56.620 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

00:00:56.620 --> 00:00:59.211 align:middle line:84%
And you have something
extraordinary to share with us.

00:00:59.211 --> 00:00:59.910 align:middle line:90%
Thank you.

00:00:59.910 --> 00:01:02.130 align:middle line:84%
And we're going to get into
your life as a little girl.

00:01:02.130 --> 00:01:04.631 align:middle line:84%
This has been going on
almost since you were born.

00:01:04.631 --> 00:01:05.330 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

00:01:05.330 --> 00:01:06.890 align:middle line:84%
But first, can I share
something with you--

00:01:06.890 --> 00:01:08.050 align:middle line:84%
Absolutely.
---that just happened?

00:01:08.050 --> 00:01:08.749 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

00:01:08.749 --> 00:01:10.350 align:middle line:84%
Just before I came
here to the studio,

00:01:10.350 --> 00:01:11.445 align:middle line:90%
I was talking to a woman.

00:01:11.445 --> 00:01:14.790 align:middle line:84%
And she said, so
what's your day like?

00:01:14.790 --> 00:01:16.380 align:middle line:84%
I said, oh, I'm
interviewing Linda Bender.

00:01:16.380 --> 00:01:17.350 align:middle line:90%
And she said, oh my.

00:01:17.350 --> 00:01:19.490 align:middle line:84%
I have to share
this story with you.

00:01:19.490 --> 00:01:22.570 align:middle line:84%
And she told me the
story of a horse.

00:01:22.570 --> 00:01:24.860 align:middle line:90%
She had always wanted a horse.

00:01:24.860 --> 00:01:28.050 align:middle line:84%
And what happened
was she had this--

00:01:28.050 --> 00:01:29.540 align:middle line:90%
we can see this horse here.

00:01:29.540 --> 00:01:30.750 align:middle line:90%
This course came to her.

00:01:30.750 --> 00:01:33.470 align:middle line:84%
And we won't show the
next photo for just a sec.

00:01:33.470 --> 00:01:36.910 align:middle line:84%
What happened was three years
before this horse came to her,

00:01:36.910 --> 00:01:41.230 align:middle line:84%
she wanted one so badly that
she had some glasswork done.

00:01:41.230 --> 00:01:42.880 align:middle line:90%
And she put it in her office.

00:01:42.880 --> 00:01:43.730 align:middle line:90%
It had the sun.

00:01:43.730 --> 00:01:46.120 align:middle line:84%
It had her as a
little light fairy,

00:01:46.120 --> 00:01:48.190 align:middle line:84%
and her beautiful
horse underneath it,

00:01:48.190 --> 00:01:50.930 align:middle line:84%
hoping that horse would
come to her one day.

00:01:50.930 --> 00:01:52.800 align:middle line:90%
Well, the horse did come to her.

00:01:52.800 --> 00:01:56.240 align:middle line:84%
Now let's take-- and by
a very strange event.

00:01:56.240 --> 00:01:59.770 align:middle line:84%
Her boss saw this
horse in a pasture,

00:01:59.770 --> 00:02:01.440 align:middle line:90%
bought it for no reason.

00:02:01.440 --> 00:02:04.060 align:middle line:84%
This is the stained
glass she had

00:02:04.060 --> 00:02:08.844 align:middle line:84%
done three years before, which
is identical to that horse.

00:02:08.844 --> 00:02:10.110 align:middle line:84%
And when you see it
in person, you can

00:02:10.110 --> 00:02:12.290 align:middle line:90%
see the color is even better.

00:02:12.290 --> 00:02:15.520 align:middle line:84%
That horse was given to her as
a gift by her boss, who said,

00:02:15.520 --> 00:02:16.920 align:middle line:84%
I just saw this
horse and bought it.

00:02:16.920 --> 00:02:18.530 align:middle line:90%
I had no idea why.

00:02:18.530 --> 00:02:20.750 align:middle line:84%
And he said, I was going
to sell it, but hey,

00:02:20.750 --> 00:02:21.880 align:middle line:90%
do you want a horse?

00:02:21.880 --> 00:02:23.951 align:middle line:84%
Gave her this horse,
which looked identical.

00:02:23.951 --> 00:02:24.650 align:middle line:90%
[INAUDIBLE].

00:02:24.650 --> 00:02:27.470 align:middle line:84%
And the man said, that
horse seemed to speak to me.

00:02:27.470 --> 00:02:29.440 align:middle line:90%
He wanted to come to you.

00:02:29.440 --> 00:02:31.270 align:middle line:84%
And that's kind of a
set-up for what we're

00:02:31.270 --> 00:02:32.250 align:middle line:90%
going to be talking about.

00:02:32.250 --> 00:02:32.950 align:middle line:90%
Absolutely.

00:02:32.950 --> 00:02:34.030 align:middle line:90%
Thank you for sharing that.

00:02:34.030 --> 00:02:34.830 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHS]

00:02:34.830 --> 00:02:36.340 align:middle line:90%
I thought it was so beautiful.

00:02:36.340 --> 00:02:38.500 align:middle line:84%
She's just still
stunned to the bones

00:02:38.500 --> 00:02:41.320 align:middle line:84%
that this horse found her--
-Yes.

00:02:41.320 --> 00:02:43.010 align:middle line:84%
---and had to go
through a lot of strange

00:02:43.010 --> 00:02:46.331 align:middle line:84%
people and circumstance
to find his way to her.

00:02:46.331 --> 00:02:47.030 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

00:02:47.030 --> 00:02:49.800 align:middle line:84%
And so let's start
now with you and how

00:02:49.800 --> 00:02:52.530 align:middle line:84%
you came to be the one that
could speak to those horses,

00:02:52.530 --> 00:02:55.010 align:middle line:84%
for example, when you
were a little girl.

00:02:55.010 --> 00:02:57.780 align:middle line:84%
Well, just let me
say the universe

00:02:57.780 --> 00:02:59.630 align:middle line:90%
does work in strange ways.

00:02:59.630 --> 00:03:01.730 align:middle line:10%
Indeed.

00:03:01.730 --> 00:03:05.510 align:middle line:10%
Many ways we have
yet to, and probably

00:03:05.510 --> 00:03:07.380 align:middle line:10%
will never, understand.

00:03:07.380 --> 00:03:11.350 align:middle line:10%
But for me, about
a year or so ago,

00:03:11.350 --> 00:03:14.520 align:middle line:10%
I was giving a lecture
on the sacred connection

00:03:14.520 --> 00:03:16.440 align:middle line:10%
between humans and animals.

00:03:16.440 --> 00:03:20.170 align:middle line:84%
And a woman came up to
me afterward and asked,

00:03:20.170 --> 00:03:22.050 align:middle line:90%
I love your stories, Linda.

00:03:22.050 --> 00:03:24.030 align:middle line:84%
Tell me, when did
this connection

00:03:24.030 --> 00:03:26.140 align:middle line:90%
begin with you and the animals?

00:03:26.140 --> 00:03:29.910 align:middle line:90%
What was it like before?

00:03:29.910 --> 00:03:34.910 align:middle line:84%
And I thought for a minute,
and replied, I don't remember.

00:03:34.910 --> 00:03:38.300 align:middle line:84%
I simply could not
remember a time before.

00:03:38.300 --> 00:03:42.340 align:middle line:84%
So later that evening, and
actually the next few days,

00:03:42.340 --> 00:03:44.940 align:middle line:90%
I thought about that.

00:03:44.940 --> 00:03:50.260 align:middle line:84%
And what came to mind
finally was a time

00:03:50.260 --> 00:03:51.410 align:middle line:90%
when I was a little girl.

00:03:51.410 --> 00:03:54.750 align:middle line:90%
I'm guessing six, seven.

00:03:54.750 --> 00:03:57.380 align:middle line:84%
And I used to play
in my backyard.

00:03:57.380 --> 00:03:59.910 align:middle line:90%
It was a suburb of New Jersey.

00:03:59.910 --> 00:04:03.980 align:middle line:84%
And there were wonderful birds
and wildlife in the backyard,

00:04:03.980 --> 00:04:08.090 align:middle line:90%
in an apple orchard past that.

00:04:08.090 --> 00:04:10.780 align:middle line:84%
And I was coming back
from the orchard one day.

00:04:10.780 --> 00:04:14.990 align:middle line:84%
And as I walked, I heard
a particularly crazy crowd

00:04:14.990 --> 00:04:17.155 align:middle line:84%
of jays, and that
peculiar call they have.

00:04:17.155 --> 00:04:17.855 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

00:04:17.855 --> 00:04:18.670 align:middle line:90%
The call, the call.

00:04:18.670 --> 00:04:19.410 align:middle line:90%
Very aggressive.

00:04:19.410 --> 00:04:20.284 align:middle line:90%
Something's up here.

00:04:20.284 --> 00:04:20.984 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

00:04:20.984 --> 00:04:22.590 align:middle line:90%
Something's up here.

00:04:22.590 --> 00:04:25.760 align:middle line:84%
And I, of course,
went straight over.

00:04:25.760 --> 00:04:31.270 align:middle line:84%
And there on the ground was
just a little ball of fluff.

00:04:31.270 --> 00:04:32.850 align:middle line:90%
I thought, what is that?

00:04:32.850 --> 00:04:34.870 align:middle line:90%
So I went over closer to look.

00:04:34.870 --> 00:04:39.160 align:middle line:84%
And there were about six or
seven little balls of fluff.

00:04:39.160 --> 00:04:44.470 align:middle line:84%
And upon careful inspection,
there were the most

00:04:44.470 --> 00:04:46.010 align:middle line:90%
beautiful little tiny babies.

00:04:46.010 --> 00:04:47.860 align:middle line:84%
They were nestlings
that had prematurely

00:04:47.860 --> 00:04:49.670 align:middle line:90%
fallen out of the nest.

00:04:49.670 --> 00:04:52.860 align:middle line:84%
Mom and dad, and all
the uncles and aunts,

00:04:52.860 --> 00:04:56.410 align:middle line:90%
were circling, goading me away.

00:04:56.410 --> 00:04:59.170 align:middle line:84%
But I persevered, reached
down, scooped them

00:04:59.170 --> 00:05:04.550 align:middle line:84%
up just as I was dive bombed on
the head, ran to the back door,

00:05:04.550 --> 00:05:06.170 align:middle line:90%
where my father met me.

00:05:06.170 --> 00:05:08.320 align:middle line:90%
And he gathered a box.

00:05:08.320 --> 00:05:10.730 align:middle line:84%
We put these little
babies in there.

00:05:10.730 --> 00:05:14.630 align:middle line:84%
They looked up at me,
and their eyes stared,

00:05:14.630 --> 00:05:18.120 align:middle line:84%
their beaks were open, they
were screaming for life.

00:05:18.120 --> 00:05:20.670 align:middle line:84%
And I can still
remember the connection.

00:05:20.670 --> 00:05:23.320 align:middle line:90%
My eyes met their eyes.

00:05:23.320 --> 00:05:25.437 align:middle line:90%
Those tiny little eyes.

00:05:25.437 --> 00:05:26.170 align:middle line:90%
And you never stopped.

00:05:26.170 --> 00:05:28.270 align:middle line:84%
And that connection
never stopped.

00:05:28.270 --> 00:05:29.350 align:middle line:90%
Well, here we see this.

00:05:29.350 --> 00:05:30.570 align:middle line:90%
I just love this.

00:05:30.570 --> 00:05:33.140 align:middle line:90%
This was a few years later.

00:05:33.140 --> 00:05:37.600 align:middle line:84%
And I might mention
that over the years,

00:05:37.600 --> 00:05:41.110 align:middle line:84%
they no longer
pecked me ever again.

00:05:41.110 --> 00:05:43.390 align:middle line:90%
They recognized me.

00:05:43.390 --> 00:05:46.110 align:middle line:84%
Generation after generation
in the corvid family,

00:05:46.110 --> 00:05:48.480 align:middle line:90%
like crows, animals recognize.

00:05:48.480 --> 00:05:50.930 align:middle line:84%
They knew me as a
helper, not a foe.

00:05:50.930 --> 00:05:52.995 align:middle line:84%
So they used to let me
do this sort of thing.

00:05:52.995 --> 00:05:53.694 align:middle line:90%
Well, look at this.

00:05:53.694 --> 00:05:56.740 align:middle line:84%
They're all sitting
on this little stick.

00:05:56.740 --> 00:05:58.660 align:middle line:84%
They're not afraid
of you at all.

00:05:58.660 --> 00:06:00.170 align:middle line:90%
And you're feeding them again.

00:06:00.170 --> 00:06:02.605 align:middle line:84%
It looks like they got the boot
or fell out of the nest early.

00:06:02.605 --> 00:06:04.291 align:middle line:84%
You're feeding them
with a little dropper.

00:06:04.291 --> 00:06:04.990 align:middle line:90%
LINDA BENDER: Right.

00:06:04.990 --> 00:06:07.320 align:middle line:84%
And this is essentially
how you spent your youth.

00:06:07.320 --> 00:06:08.310 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

00:06:08.310 --> 00:06:09.650 align:middle line:90%
Very much so.

00:06:09.650 --> 00:06:11.660 align:middle line:84%
Well, it was certainly
no surprise that you

00:06:11.660 --> 00:06:13.465 align:middle line:90%
were going to become a vet.

00:06:13.465 --> 00:06:14.800 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHS]

00:06:14.800 --> 00:06:17.490 align:middle line:84%
So tell us about, as you
went through life, you also

00:06:17.490 --> 00:06:20.061 align:middle line:84%
must have had house
pets in your youth.

00:06:20.061 --> 00:06:20.760 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

00:06:20.760 --> 00:06:25.780 align:middle line:84%
And did you start connecting
with them in that way as well?

00:06:25.780 --> 00:06:26.890 align:middle line:90%
I did.

00:06:26.890 --> 00:06:32.280 align:middle line:84%
My earlier childhood
stories were mostly outside.

00:06:32.280 --> 00:06:36.990 align:middle line:84%
I had a mother who had a
dog, a young dog-- a poodle.

00:06:36.990 --> 00:06:41.680 align:middle line:84%
And I loved that little poodle,
but I always wanted a cat.

00:06:41.680 --> 00:06:46.640 align:middle line:84%
And my mom was allergic, so
I never got the cat I wanted.

00:06:46.640 --> 00:06:50.300 align:middle line:84%
But it wasn't until my
20's that I actually

00:06:50.300 --> 00:06:55.340 align:middle line:84%
got my first cat, who I found
with a little Nestle's milk

00:06:55.340 --> 00:06:56.240 align:middle line:90%
can on his head.

00:06:56.240 --> 00:06:59.470 align:middle line:84%
Actually, animals
usually find me.

00:06:59.470 --> 00:07:00.590 align:middle line:84%
He had a little
can on his head?

00:07:00.590 --> 00:07:01.690 align:middle line:84%
He had a little
can on his head.

00:07:01.690 --> 00:07:02.417 align:middle line:90%
And he came--

00:07:02.417 --> 00:07:03.950 align:middle line:84%
He'd been trying to
lick it and it got stuck?

00:07:03.950 --> 00:07:05.060 align:middle line:90%
Yes, stuck on his head.

00:07:05.060 --> 00:07:07.210 align:middle line:84%
So of course I
picked him up, got

00:07:07.210 --> 00:07:10.430 align:middle line:84%
him out of that predicament,
and it was, again, instant love.

00:07:10.430 --> 00:07:12.880 align:middle line:84%
So we were together
for 20 years.

00:07:12.880 --> 00:07:14.430 align:middle line:90%
And that was my cat Whimsy.

00:07:14.430 --> 00:07:16.030 align:middle line:90%
REGINA MEREDITH: Whimsy, yes.

00:07:16.030 --> 00:07:18.461 align:middle line:84%
We're going to talk about
Whimsy in a little bit again.

00:07:18.461 --> 00:07:20.600 align:middle line:84%
LINDA BENDER: Yes.
-And, OK.

00:07:20.600 --> 00:07:25.460 align:middle line:84%
So as you graduated from
veterinarian school,

00:07:25.460 --> 00:07:28.390 align:middle line:84%
did you have a different kind
of connection with the animals

00:07:28.390 --> 00:07:30.037 align:middle line:84%
when you were going
through your training?

00:07:30.037 --> 00:07:31.070 align:middle line:90%
LINDA BENDER: Yes, and it was--

00:07:31.070 --> 00:07:32.830 align:middle line:84%
Did you see the whole
process of what you were

00:07:32.830 --> 00:07:33.860 align:middle line:90%
learning in a different way?

00:07:33.860 --> 00:07:35.550 align:middle line:90%
It was very difficult for me.

00:07:35.550 --> 00:07:37.550 align:middle line:84%
And even before vet
school, I remember

00:07:37.550 --> 00:07:42.130 align:middle line:84%
my first encounter at a
vet clinic was oh, come on.

00:07:42.130 --> 00:07:43.060 align:middle line:90%
Yes, volunteer.

00:07:43.060 --> 00:07:44.370 align:middle line:90%
Come in here.

00:07:44.370 --> 00:07:46.570 align:middle line:90%
Just help hold this dog.

00:07:46.570 --> 00:07:49.850 align:middle line:84%
And of course, I ran over, and
I was going to save and rescue

00:07:49.850 --> 00:07:52.440 align:middle line:90%
my first animal in the clinic.

00:07:52.440 --> 00:07:55.590 align:middle line:84%
And unfortunately,
it was a euthanasia.

00:07:55.590 --> 00:07:56.407 align:middle line:90%
So the dog--

00:07:56.407 --> 00:07:57.140 align:middle line:90%
REGINA MEREDITH: Whoa.

00:07:57.140 --> 00:07:59.380 align:middle line:90%
What a horrible emotional shock.

00:07:59.380 --> 00:08:01.750 align:middle line:84%
And it was a big
emotional shock,

00:08:01.750 --> 00:08:06.750 align:middle line:84%
but it was my first lesson that
this is not going to be all

00:08:06.750 --> 00:08:09.650 align:middle line:84%
rosy, and that there
is a side of veterinary

00:08:09.650 --> 00:08:13.886 align:middle line:84%
medicine that requires a
certain amount of courage--

00:08:13.886 --> 00:08:15.800 align:middle line:84%
Absolutely.
---to persevere.

00:08:15.800 --> 00:08:18.740 align:middle line:90%
And other stories, many of them.

00:08:18.740 --> 00:08:19.810 align:middle line:90%
Many others.

00:08:19.810 --> 00:08:22.750 align:middle line:84%
Well, before we go into
the veterinary clinic,

00:08:22.750 --> 00:08:24.250 align:middle line:84%
and before we
start talking about

00:08:24.250 --> 00:08:26.980 align:middle line:84%
our fuzzy little companions,
your work took you

00:08:26.980 --> 00:08:28.650 align:middle line:90%
out with large game animals.

00:08:28.650 --> 00:08:32.559 align:middle line:84%
And you had a couple of
really mystical experiences.

00:08:32.559 --> 00:08:37.990 align:middle line:84%
But let's talk about who
they are on this planet,

00:08:37.990 --> 00:08:41.740 align:middle line:84%
and what they're
looking to from us.

00:08:41.740 --> 00:08:44.151 align:middle line:84%
As you told me off camera, we're
encroaching on their territory.

00:08:44.151 --> 00:08:44.850 align:middle line:90%
LINDA BENDER: Yes.

00:08:44.850 --> 00:08:47.161 align:middle line:84%
We're damaging the
environment of the planet.

00:08:47.161 --> 00:08:48.180 align:middle line:84%
LINDA BENDER: Yes.
Yes.

00:08:48.180 --> 00:08:50.640 align:middle line:84%
They have very specific
ideas, thoughts,

00:08:50.640 --> 00:08:52.607 align:middle line:84%
and feelings about all this.
-They do.

00:08:52.607 --> 00:08:54.040 align:middle line:84%
And so why don't you
just start telling us

00:08:54.040 --> 00:08:57.150 align:middle line:84%
about some of your wild
refuge experiences?

00:08:57.150 --> 00:09:00.830 align:middle line:84%
Well, I've had quite a
bit of that experience.

00:09:00.830 --> 00:09:05.880 align:middle line:84%
And back in the day, I was
living in Southeast Asia.

00:09:05.880 --> 00:09:09.100 align:middle line:84%
And I did a lot of
work with animals

00:09:09.100 --> 00:09:12.200 align:middle line:84%
who were victims of
the animal trafficking

00:09:12.200 --> 00:09:15.040 align:middle line:84%
trade. i tried to rehabilitate
them, keep them alive.

00:09:15.040 --> 00:09:16.380 align:middle line:90%
Rehabilitate them.

00:09:16.380 --> 00:09:21.760 align:middle line:84%
And so I was able to see all
kinds of amazing animals.

00:09:21.760 --> 00:09:32.310 align:middle line:84%
Tigers, leopards, gorillas,
rare, rare psittacine parrots.

00:09:32.310 --> 00:09:36.970 align:middle line:84%
And the problem
that I encountered

00:09:36.970 --> 00:09:42.150 align:middle line:84%
was the ability
to continue doing

00:09:42.150 --> 00:09:45.180 align:middle line:84%
my work knowing that
there was such cruelty

00:09:45.180 --> 00:09:48.940 align:middle line:90%
and ignorance in the world.

00:09:48.940 --> 00:09:50.630 align:middle line:90%
It was difficult time.

00:09:50.630 --> 00:09:55.080 align:middle line:84%
I almost gave up one or
two times-- probably more

00:09:55.080 --> 00:09:56.530 align:middle line:90%
than one or two times.

00:09:56.530 --> 00:09:59.860 align:middle line:84%
But my connection and my
conviction to the animals

00:09:59.860 --> 00:10:03.600 align:middle line:84%
became deeper and deeper
through this process.

00:10:03.600 --> 00:10:08.640 align:middle line:84%
And, you know, we are now 7
billion people on the planet.

00:10:08.640 --> 00:10:14.150 align:middle line:84%
And so for reasons
of loss of habitat,

00:10:14.150 --> 00:10:21.330 align:middle line:84%
pollution, and hunting,
we're losing so many of our--

00:10:21.330 --> 00:10:22.030 align:middle line:90%
REGINA MEREDITH: Yes.

00:10:22.030 --> 00:10:26.050 align:middle line:84%
---our animals, especially
the large land mammals.

00:10:26.050 --> 00:10:28.640 align:middle line:84%
The elephants that
are meant to be

00:10:28.640 --> 00:10:33.810 align:middle line:84%
walking the longitudinal
meridians in Africa

00:10:33.810 --> 00:10:35.520 align:middle line:90%
are now being cut off.

00:10:35.520 --> 00:10:38.800 align:middle line:90%
They can't do that anymore.

00:10:38.800 --> 00:10:41.750 align:middle line:84%
A small example of
how that severely

00:10:41.750 --> 00:10:46.070 align:middle line:84%
affects all animals-- it isn't
only that the elephants suffer.

00:10:46.070 --> 00:10:49.550 align:middle line:84%
One enormous footprint
of an elephant

00:10:49.550 --> 00:10:53.895 align:middle line:84%
creates an entire ecosystem
for other small species.

00:10:53.895 --> 00:10:58.340 align:middle line:84%
And in the rain, when the rains
dry, and in the dry periods,

00:10:58.340 --> 00:11:02.770 align:middle line:84%
that creates an entire water
well for other small birds,

00:11:02.770 --> 00:11:04.180 align:middle line:90%
other creatures.

00:11:04.180 --> 00:11:07.650 align:middle line:90%
So that's one example.

00:11:07.650 --> 00:11:09.199 align:middle line:84%
There's so many.
-Yes.

00:11:09.199 --> 00:11:12.500 align:middle line:84%
And tell us about
another, maybe a couple

00:11:12.500 --> 00:11:17.960 align:middle line:84%
of your kind of heart-to-heart,
soul-to-soul experiences

00:11:17.960 --> 00:11:20.820 align:middle line:84%
you had with some of
these wild animals.

00:11:20.820 --> 00:11:22.670 align:middle line:84%
I would love to
hear some of that,

00:11:22.670 --> 00:11:25.240 align:middle line:84%
and what they were
trying to convey to you.

00:11:25.240 --> 00:11:32.280 align:middle line:84%
Well, what I believe
is happening in wildlife

00:11:32.280 --> 00:11:36.540 align:middle line:84%
is that because we
are so many humans,

00:11:36.540 --> 00:11:41.260 align:middle line:84%
they no longer live in
blissful ignorance of us.

00:11:41.260 --> 00:11:45.400 align:middle line:84%
They are now being forced
to connect with us in ways

00:11:45.400 --> 00:11:47.740 align:middle line:90%
that they've never done before.

00:11:47.740 --> 00:11:53.850 align:middle line:84%
So to those people
who are interested,

00:11:53.850 --> 00:11:58.640 align:middle line:84%
who open from their
hearts, I would describe it

00:11:58.640 --> 00:12:02.630 align:middle line:84%
as if animals-- all
animals, companion

00:12:02.630 --> 00:12:09.860 align:middle line:84%
animals and wildlife-- offer
us an invitation to connect.

00:12:09.860 --> 00:12:17.310 align:middle line:84%
And if we choose to look at
that invitation and respond,

00:12:17.310 --> 00:12:22.040 align:middle line:84%
they are then willing to
come to us at whatever level

00:12:22.040 --> 00:12:28.230 align:middle line:84%
we are able to understand,
and help share their concerns,

00:12:28.230 --> 00:12:31.080 align:middle line:84%
and their lives,
and their cultures.

00:12:31.080 --> 00:12:34.310 align:middle line:90%
For me, all life is soul.

00:12:34.310 --> 00:12:37.725 align:middle line:84%
All life is connected, as
we're learning now in physics,

00:12:37.725 --> 00:12:39.500 align:middle line:90%
in quantum physics.

00:12:39.500 --> 00:12:41.810 align:middle line:84%
My son is an
aspiring physicists,

00:12:41.810 --> 00:12:44.020 align:middle line:84%
so I always confirm
these things with him.

00:12:44.020 --> 00:12:45.419 align:middle line:84%
Yes.
Yes.

00:12:45.419 --> 00:12:46.230 align:middle line:90%
And I got the nod.

00:12:46.230 --> 00:12:46.930 align:middle line:90%
Yes, mom.

00:12:46.930 --> 00:12:49.090 align:middle line:90%
We are all connected.

00:12:49.090 --> 00:12:52.300 align:middle line:84%
But it is, to me,
wonderful confirmation

00:12:52.300 --> 00:13:00.100 align:middle line:84%
of what I understood as a
child-- which does remind me

00:13:00.100 --> 00:13:03.070 align:middle line:84%
of a time when I was
a child and I was

00:13:03.070 --> 00:13:05.800 align:middle line:90%
looking out my bedroom window.

00:13:05.800 --> 00:13:09.265 align:middle line:84%
And there was a beautiful
robin in a branch.

00:13:09.265 --> 00:13:13.950 align:middle line:84%
And I just enjoyed listening
to that robin sing,

00:13:13.950 --> 00:13:16.430 align:middle line:90%
and admiring its beautiful nest.

00:13:16.430 --> 00:13:19.751 align:middle line:84%
Robins are just
awesome nest builders.

00:13:19.751 --> 00:13:20.450 align:middle line:90%
They're the best.

00:13:20.450 --> 00:13:22.311 align:middle line:84%
They're so precise in
their nest building.

00:13:22.311 --> 00:13:24.930 align:middle line:84%
-They're the best.
-Yes, they're experts.

00:13:24.930 --> 00:13:28.750 align:middle line:84%
As a matter of
fact, a female robin

00:13:28.750 --> 00:13:32.690 align:middle line:84%
will choose her mate by what
he brings to her to offer

00:13:32.690 --> 00:13:34.160 align:middle line:90%
his nest building capabilities.

00:13:34.160 --> 00:13:36.090 align:middle line:84%
REGINA MEREDITH:
Oh, interesting.

00:13:36.090 --> 00:13:36.970 align:middle line:90%
Yeah, the sticks.

00:13:36.970 --> 00:13:39.752 align:middle line:84%
And if she doesn't like the
sticks, he's out of there.

00:13:39.752 --> 00:13:40.451 align:middle line:90%
OK?

00:13:40.451 --> 00:13:44.010 align:middle line:84%
But anyway, I was watching
this particular robin.

00:13:44.010 --> 00:13:47.990 align:middle line:84%
And of course, as a child,
I knew none of this,

00:13:47.990 --> 00:13:50.120 align:middle line:84%
but I believe to
this day that it

00:13:50.120 --> 00:13:55.960 align:middle line:84%
was a type of oneness experience
that I had with this robin.

00:13:55.960 --> 00:14:00.030 align:middle line:84%
Again, there was an invitation
to join, to come closer,

00:14:00.030 --> 00:14:02.750 align:middle line:90%
to connect through our hearts.

00:14:02.750 --> 00:14:06.230 align:middle line:84%
And that invitation opened
to a deeper soul connection--

00:14:06.230 --> 00:14:10.640 align:middle line:84%
to the recognition that
this is a soul, I am a soul,

00:14:10.640 --> 00:14:11.900 align:middle line:90%
but we are really one.

00:14:11.900 --> 00:14:17.060 align:middle line:84%
And we are joyously together
in this cosmic oneness.

00:14:17.060 --> 00:14:22.180 align:middle line:84%
And I remember-- I actually
remember feeling connected.

00:14:22.180 --> 00:14:25.340 align:middle line:84%
Feeling what the
vedics, the sages,

00:14:25.340 --> 00:14:31.185 align:middle line:84%
describe as loss of where my
body ends and the trees begin,

00:14:31.185 --> 00:14:35.730 align:middle line:84%
or where the body of the
bird began and ended.

00:14:35.730 --> 00:14:37.960 align:middle line:84%
And it was a
beautiful experience.

00:14:37.960 --> 00:14:43.380 align:middle line:84%
And it just happened naturally
through the connection

00:14:43.380 --> 00:14:45.220 align:middle line:90%
of a heart and soul.

00:14:45.220 --> 00:14:47.230 align:middle line:84%
So it's continued
through the wildlife,

00:14:47.230 --> 00:14:48.820 align:middle line:90%
and it continues today.

00:14:48.820 --> 00:14:50.660 align:middle line:84%
What are some of
the wildlife cultures

00:14:50.660 --> 00:14:53.530 align:middle line:84%
that you have a particular
fascination with

00:14:53.530 --> 00:14:56.820 align:middle line:90%
or respect for as cultures go?

00:14:56.820 --> 00:14:58.270 align:middle line:90%
Oh gosh, so many.

00:14:58.270 --> 00:15:01.550 align:middle line:84%
Well, all we have to do
is look out our window

00:15:01.550 --> 00:15:03.150 align:middle line:90%
to the common squirrel.

00:15:03.150 --> 00:15:04.790 align:middle line:90%
Oh, yes.

00:15:04.790 --> 00:15:05.534 align:middle line:90%
I love squirrels.

00:15:05.534 --> 00:15:06.400 align:middle line:90%
I used to hand feed them.

00:15:06.400 --> 00:15:07.980 align:middle line:90%
I do too.

00:15:07.980 --> 00:15:11.560 align:middle line:84%
Squirrels are-- you know some
people consider them pets.

00:15:11.560 --> 00:15:14.030 align:middle line:90%
They are absolutely fabulous.

00:15:14.030 --> 00:15:15.965 align:middle line:90%
They live life on the edge--

00:15:15.965 --> 00:15:16.965 align:middle line:90%
REGINA MEREDITH: Yes, they do.

00:15:16.965 --> 00:15:21.940 align:middle line:84%
---because they are,
as opposed to robins,

00:15:21.940 --> 00:15:24.200 align:middle line:84%
who are meticulous
nest builders, they are

00:15:24.200 --> 00:15:26.350 align:middle line:90%
fancy free about their nests.

00:15:26.350 --> 00:15:29.590 align:middle line:84%
You know, if something
goes wrong and whatever,

00:15:29.590 --> 00:15:32.750 align:middle line:84%
they abandon their home
and create another one.

00:15:32.750 --> 00:15:37.900 align:middle line:84%
But they also can fall great
distances and not get hurt.

00:15:37.900 --> 00:15:40.540 align:middle line:84%
Their tails are a
type of parachute.

00:15:40.540 --> 00:15:45.120 align:middle line:84%
So they become ever more daring,
I think, in their escapades.

00:15:45.120 --> 00:15:49.385 align:middle line:84%
So although it's devastating
when a squirrel runs out

00:15:49.385 --> 00:15:52.850 align:middle line:84%
in the road and
gets hurt or killed,

00:15:52.850 --> 00:15:55.350 align:middle line:84%
you know, that's
what squirrels do.

00:15:55.350 --> 00:15:59.250 align:middle line:84%
And so it's our job to
drive a little more slowly.

00:15:59.250 --> 00:16:00.730 align:middle line:90%
But I adore squirrels.

00:16:00.730 --> 00:16:02.740 align:middle line:84%
So they really
bring to the table

00:16:02.740 --> 00:16:06.491 align:middle line:84%
a sense of adventure
and wild daring.

00:16:06.491 --> 00:16:07.880 align:middle line:84%
Wildness.
Steering.

00:16:07.880 --> 00:16:09.120 align:middle line:84%
REGINA MEREDITH: Yes.
-Yes.

00:16:09.120 --> 00:16:10.546 align:middle line:84%
Yes.
-[INAUDIBLE].

00:16:10.546 --> 00:16:12.970 align:middle line:84%
And can you imagine
what you would be

00:16:12.970 --> 00:16:15.180 align:middle line:90%
like if you could jump 50 feet?

00:16:15.180 --> 00:16:16.220 align:middle line:90%
Yeah, no kidding.

00:16:16.220 --> 00:16:17.130 align:middle line:90%
You just want to do it.

00:16:17.130 --> 00:16:18.736 align:middle line:84%
You'd have to.
-Yeah.

00:16:18.736 --> 00:16:20.000 align:middle line:84%
So that's one
interesting account.

00:16:20.000 --> 00:16:20.580 align:middle line:84%
That's interesting.
LINDA BENDER: Yes.

00:16:20.580 --> 00:16:21.710 align:middle line:90%
What about rabbits?

00:16:21.710 --> 00:16:25.280 align:middle line:84%
I mean, everyone says,
what are they thinking?

00:16:25.280 --> 00:16:26.600 align:middle line:90%
Same as with squirrels.

00:16:26.600 --> 00:16:27.620 align:middle line:90%
What are they thinking?

00:16:27.620 --> 00:16:30.390 align:middle line:84%
Why do they wait until the
car's right there to dart

00:16:30.390 --> 00:16:31.880 align:middle line:84%
right out in front of you?
LINDA BENDER: Right.

00:16:31.880 --> 00:16:33.060 align:middle line:84%
Yeah.
-What's up with that?

00:16:33.060 --> 00:16:36.910 align:middle line:84%
Well, one thing that I
feel very strongly about,

00:16:36.910 --> 00:16:42.040 align:middle line:84%
and we do need to remember,
is that animals are living

00:16:42.040 --> 00:16:43.500 align:middle line:84%
in their natural habitat.
REGINA MEREDITH: That's right.

00:16:43.500 --> 00:16:44.560 align:middle line:90%
And we're driving through it.

00:16:44.560 --> 00:16:49.690 align:middle line:84%
Be they rabbits, squirrels,
deer, whatever, they are simply

00:16:49.690 --> 00:16:51.670 align:middle line:84%
living in their habitats.
REGINA MEREDITH: Yes.

00:16:51.670 --> 00:16:54.350 align:middle line:84%
We have cut our roads
through their habitats.

00:16:54.350 --> 00:16:55.170 align:middle line:90%
REGINA MEREDITH: Yes.

00:16:55.170 --> 00:16:58.510 align:middle line:84%
So rather than thinking we
have the right of way, actually,

00:16:58.510 --> 00:16:59.340 align:middle line:90%
they do.

00:16:59.340 --> 00:17:00.073 align:middle line:90%
REGINA MEREDITH: Sure.

00:17:00.073 --> 00:17:05.010 align:middle line:84%
So all creatures
are not expecting

00:17:05.010 --> 00:17:08.639 align:middle line:90%
us to put ourselves first.

00:17:08.639 --> 00:17:10.330 align:middle line:84%
You know, I can
understand that.

00:17:10.330 --> 00:17:11.030 align:middle line:90%
LINDA BENDER: Yes.

00:17:11.030 --> 00:17:16.069 align:middle line:84%
But if the car is moving along,
why choose that really daring

00:17:16.069 --> 00:17:18.294 align:middle line:90%
moment to go, in a sense?

00:17:18.294 --> 00:17:20.950 align:middle line:84%
You know, I'd never--
you'd think if there's

00:17:20.950 --> 00:17:24.490 align:middle line:84%
an instinct for survival,
if you see a vehicle moving

00:17:24.490 --> 00:17:27.200 align:middle line:84%
towards you, there would be a
freeze or something, instead

00:17:27.200 --> 00:17:28.830 align:middle line:84%
of, oh, right, green light.
Let's go.

00:17:28.830 --> 00:17:32.360 align:middle line:84%
Well, in some
species, they don't see

00:17:32.360 --> 00:17:33.867 align:middle line:90%
particularly well, you know?

00:17:33.867 --> 00:17:35.300 align:middle line:84%
REGINA MEREDITH: Yeah,
that's a good point.

00:17:35.300 --> 00:17:37.297 align:middle line:84%
And certain species
are better at vision.

00:17:37.297 --> 00:17:38.030 align:middle line:90%
REGINA MEREDITH: Yeah.

00:17:38.030 --> 00:17:39.740 align:middle line:90%
Others are better at sound.

00:17:39.740 --> 00:17:41.200 align:middle line:90%
Others are, you know--

00:17:41.200 --> 00:17:43.361 align:middle line:84%
Well, you would think with
rabbits, it must be sound.

00:17:43.361 --> 00:17:44.060 align:middle line:90%
LINDA BENDER: Well--

00:17:44.060 --> 00:17:45.240 align:middle line:84%
But how do they
see [INAUDIBLE]?

00:17:45.240 --> 00:17:48.120 align:middle line:84%
I actually cannot
speak on behalf of--

00:17:48.120 --> 00:17:48.960 align:middle line:90%
Of rabbits.

00:17:48.960 --> 00:17:50.943 align:middle line:84%
---why that rabbit
would jump out.

00:17:50.943 --> 00:17:51.930 align:middle line:90%
Yes, I know.

00:17:51.930 --> 00:17:54.000 align:middle line:84%
It's just a common
phenomena everybody

00:17:54.000 --> 00:17:54.940 align:middle line:90%
scratches their head over.

00:17:54.940 --> 00:17:55.890 align:middle line:84%
-Well, it is.
-Sure.

00:17:55.890 --> 00:17:56.590 align:middle line:90%
It is.

00:17:56.590 --> 00:17:57.871 align:middle line:84%
And maybe they
don't see that well.

00:17:57.871 --> 00:17:58.570 align:middle line:90%
You're right.

00:17:58.570 --> 00:18:01.130 align:middle line:84%
Maybe they feel the
rumbling on the ground,

00:18:01.130 --> 00:18:03.700 align:middle line:84%
and it excites them to movement
or something like that.

00:18:03.700 --> 00:18:05.530 align:middle line:84%
So maybe we could
get feedback on that.

00:18:05.530 --> 00:18:07.580 align:middle line:84%
Yeah, maybe we could
connect with them

00:18:07.580 --> 00:18:09.440 align:middle line:84%
and find out what's up.
LINDA BENDER: Yeah.

00:18:09.440 --> 00:18:14.840 align:middle line:84%
Now, you also worked with some
villagers around the world,

00:18:14.840 --> 00:18:16.430 align:middle line:90%
having to do with anti-poaching.

00:18:16.430 --> 00:18:20.141 align:middle line:84%
And this is a real-- this is a
very sensitive and very painful

00:18:20.141 --> 00:18:20.840 align:middle line:90%
kind of issue.

00:18:20.840 --> 00:18:23.641 align:middle line:84%
And can you talk to us a
little bit about what goes on--

00:18:23.641 --> 00:18:24.340 align:middle line:90%
Oh yes.

00:18:24.340 --> 00:18:26.980 align:middle line:84%
---and how we might
be, even inadvertently,

00:18:26.980 --> 00:18:32.180 align:middle line:84%
participating in it or
supporting it, if not directly?

00:18:32.180 --> 00:18:35.080 align:middle line:84%
Yes, it is
difficult. And when I

00:18:35.080 --> 00:18:38.900 align:middle line:84%
think of Africa and the
problems you speak of,

00:18:38.900 --> 00:18:40.460 align:middle line:90%
I tend to take a deep breath.

00:18:40.460 --> 00:18:43.240 align:middle line:90%
And it can be overwhelming.

00:18:43.240 --> 00:18:49.170 align:middle line:84%
But my deep philosophy in all
this is the old story of you

00:18:49.170 --> 00:18:53.390 align:middle line:84%
cannot save everything,
but you can certainly save

00:18:53.390 --> 00:18:55.670 align:middle line:90%
what walks across your path.

00:18:55.670 --> 00:18:56.790 align:middle line:90%
That is my mantra.

00:18:56.790 --> 00:18:58.520 align:middle line:90%
That is what I do.

00:18:58.520 --> 00:18:59.690 align:middle line:90%
And--

00:18:59.690 --> 00:19:03.160 align:middle line:84%
Tell us the nature, in
this day and age, of what

00:19:03.160 --> 00:19:05.220 align:middle line:90%
the poaching world is like.

00:19:05.220 --> 00:19:07.060 align:middle line:84%
I mean, because
we're sitting safely

00:19:07.060 --> 00:19:08.659 align:middle line:84%
tucked away from all of it.
LINDA BENDER: Right.

00:19:08.659 --> 00:19:09.830 align:middle line:90%
What is still being poached?

00:19:09.830 --> 00:19:11.560 align:middle line:84%
What is being taken
to extinction?

00:19:11.560 --> 00:19:13.630 align:middle line:84%
LINDA BENDER: Well,
one thing Americans

00:19:13.630 --> 00:19:17.800 align:middle line:84%
need to remember is that
although we're not--

00:19:17.800 --> 00:19:23.370 align:middle line:84%
we tend to feel just
distracted from it because,

00:19:23.370 --> 00:19:25.060 align:middle line:90%
oh, well, it isn't our problem.

00:19:25.060 --> 00:19:26.300 align:middle line:90%
We're not poaching.

00:19:26.300 --> 00:19:29.030 align:middle line:84%
But still-- it's
hard to believe,

00:19:29.030 --> 00:19:31.130 align:middle line:84%
but still, this country
is one of the biggest

00:19:31.130 --> 00:19:33.610 align:middle line:90%
markets for poached goods.

00:19:33.610 --> 00:19:36.650 align:middle line:84%
What kind of poached
goods are we talking about?

00:19:36.650 --> 00:19:41.030 align:middle line:84%
Open the pages of your
latest fashion magazines.

00:19:41.030 --> 00:19:42.210 align:middle line:84%
REGINA MEREDITH:
Well, certainly.

00:19:42.210 --> 00:19:43.730 align:middle line:90%
Flip through the pages.

00:19:43.730 --> 00:19:47.310 align:middle line:84%
You'll see that
I'm talking about.

00:19:47.310 --> 00:19:48.800 align:middle line:90%
And what about big game?

00:19:48.800 --> 00:19:51.870 align:middle line:84%
I mean, is that scene
still going on, or--

00:19:51.870 --> 00:19:54.460 align:middle line:90%
It's better.

00:19:54.460 --> 00:19:55.710 align:middle line:90%
It's not good.

00:19:55.710 --> 00:19:59.770 align:middle line:84%
But poaching in Africa, for
example, one thing we really

00:19:59.770 --> 00:20:07.360 align:middle line:84%
need to be mindful of is that
elephants, their body parts

00:20:07.360 --> 00:20:14.200 align:middle line:90%
are still being taken for ivory.

00:20:14.200 --> 00:20:17.250 align:middle line:84%
And rhinos--
actually, the poaching

00:20:17.250 --> 00:20:20.580 align:middle line:84%
of elephants and rhinos
is more now than ever.

00:20:20.580 --> 00:20:23.300 align:middle line:84%
And it's become
more sophisticated.

00:20:23.300 --> 00:20:25.220 align:middle line:84%
Poaching of--
-How so?

00:20:25.220 --> 00:20:29.860 align:middle line:84%
---those animals is probably
second only to the drug

00:20:29.860 --> 00:20:32.430 align:middle line:84%
culture in the world.
-Seriously?

00:20:32.430 --> 00:20:33.924 align:middle line:84%
It's that bad?
-Yes.

00:20:33.924 --> 00:20:40.190 align:middle line:84%
And in Asia, there's still
the old mistaken belief

00:20:40.190 --> 00:20:43.360 align:middle line:84%
that there are medicinal
qualities to those body parts.

00:20:43.360 --> 00:20:44.825 align:middle line:84%
REGINA MEREDITH: Right.
Right.

00:20:44.825 --> 00:20:45.640 align:middle line:90%
Right.

00:20:45.640 --> 00:20:48.380 align:middle line:84%
So education,
education, education.

00:20:48.380 --> 00:20:49.420 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

00:20:49.420 --> 00:20:52.510 align:middle line:84%
And you have spent time-- we
touched on it a moment ago.

00:20:52.510 --> 00:20:53.640 align:middle line:84%
You've spent time
with elephants.

00:20:53.640 --> 00:20:54.340 align:middle line:90%
LINDA BENDER: Yes.

00:20:54.340 --> 00:20:55.590 align:middle line:90%
I adore elephants.

00:20:55.590 --> 00:20:58.190 align:middle line:84%
Can you tell us a little
bit about their culture

00:20:58.190 --> 00:21:01.260 align:middle line:84%
and their world in India
and Southeast Asia, what

00:21:01.260 --> 00:21:03.080 align:middle line:84%
the greatest
threats to them are,

00:21:03.080 --> 00:21:05.180 align:middle line:84%
and some of the beauty
of that culture?

00:21:05.180 --> 00:21:06.700 align:middle line:90%
Oh, elephants.

00:21:06.700 --> 00:21:07.740 align:middle line:90%
I do dearly love elephants.

00:21:07.740 --> 00:21:10.120 align:middle line:84%
REGINA MEREDITH: And
you've been with elephants.

00:21:10.120 --> 00:21:11.590 align:middle line:84%
LINDA BENDER: I've
been with elephants.

00:21:11.590 --> 00:21:17.420 align:middle line:84%
I have had a few very deep
connections with elephants.

00:21:17.420 --> 00:21:21.160 align:middle line:84%
And the number one
problem with poaching--

00:21:21.160 --> 00:21:23.640 align:middle line:84%
and again, they're
always the same issues.

00:21:23.640 --> 00:21:26.830 align:middle line:84%
It's loss of habitat,
because of humans

00:21:26.830 --> 00:21:29.000 align:middle line:90%
encroaching on that territory.

00:21:29.000 --> 00:21:32.750 align:middle line:84%
And then there's the
farming of the humans.

00:21:32.750 --> 00:21:36.890 align:middle line:84%
So the elephants have fewer
and fewer places to go.

00:21:36.890 --> 00:21:38.290 align:middle line:90%
And they must roam.

00:21:38.290 --> 00:21:39.980 align:middle line:90%
They cannot be enclosed.

00:21:39.980 --> 00:21:42.500 align:middle line:84%
There are people
like Peter Beard,

00:21:42.500 --> 00:21:48.680 align:middle line:84%
for example, who, for many,
many years, was living in Africa

00:21:48.680 --> 00:21:52.710 align:middle line:84%
and documented the-- it's
a fascinating story, how

00:21:52.710 --> 00:21:56.210 align:middle line:84%
the first white people
came to East Africa.

00:21:56.210 --> 00:21:58.950 align:middle line:84%
And how that the
populations of wildlife

00:21:58.950 --> 00:22:03.280 align:middle line:84%
was just so vast that no
one could ever even imagine

00:22:03.280 --> 00:22:07.270 align:middle line:84%
there would ever be a
reduction in the abundance

00:22:07.270 --> 00:22:08.900 align:middle line:90%
of all wildlife.

00:22:08.900 --> 00:22:11.230 align:middle line:84%
And then some of
those early hunters

00:22:11.230 --> 00:22:15.380 align:middle line:84%
back in the time of
Roosevelt and those people,

00:22:15.380 --> 00:22:17.930 align:middle line:90%
they actually saw a decline.

00:22:17.930 --> 00:22:23.240 align:middle line:84%
And they became the first people
to set up game parks to protect

00:22:23.240 --> 00:22:25.110 align:middle line:90%
the animals and the elephants.

00:22:25.110 --> 00:22:26.980 align:middle line:84%
And they learned over
the years what worked

00:22:26.980 --> 00:22:27.940 align:middle line:90%
and what didn't work.

00:22:27.940 --> 00:22:30.230 align:middle line:84%
And what they for certain
learned is you cannot

00:22:30.230 --> 00:22:32.800 align:middle line:90%
enclose these wild beings.

00:22:32.800 --> 00:22:36.700 align:middle line:90%
And elephants need to roam.

00:22:36.700 --> 00:22:39.480 align:middle line:84%
Elephants need to
walk those meridians.

00:22:39.480 --> 00:22:42.160 align:middle line:84%
Tell us about that walking
of the longitudinal meridians

00:22:42.160 --> 00:22:44.090 align:middle line:84%
you spoke of earlier.
-Right.

00:22:44.090 --> 00:22:47.720 align:middle line:84%
That is the sacred
meridians, as well

00:22:47.720 --> 00:22:50.410 align:middle line:84%
as-- I think we're
going to hopefully

00:22:50.410 --> 00:22:52.094 align:middle line:90%
talk later about the lions--

00:22:52.094 --> 00:22:53.360 align:middle line:84%
REGINA MEREDITH:
Yes, we are going to.

00:22:53.360 --> 00:22:55.530 align:middle line:90%
---in South Africa.

00:22:55.530 --> 00:22:59.020 align:middle line:84%
The shaman, the African
shaman, the Zulu people,

00:22:59.020 --> 00:23:02.780 align:middle line:84%
and all the indigenous
cultures speak of these animals

00:23:02.780 --> 00:23:08.870 align:middle line:84%
as sacred beings who are the
first beings of the land,

00:23:08.870 --> 00:23:10.620 align:middle line:90%
and must be respected.

00:23:10.620 --> 00:23:11.320 align:middle line:90%
REGINA MEREDITH: Yes.

00:23:11.320 --> 00:23:14.417 align:middle line:84%
Unfortunately, that's
now coming into conflict.

00:23:14.417 --> 00:23:15.350 align:middle line:90%
REGINA MEREDITH: Yes, it is.

00:23:15.350 --> 00:23:18.150 align:middle line:84%
And elephants and all
the other wild creatures

00:23:18.150 --> 00:23:24.780 align:middle line:84%
are trying to learn
about us, trying to,

00:23:24.780 --> 00:23:27.510 align:middle line:90%
if possible, understand.

00:23:27.510 --> 00:23:31.800 align:middle line:84%
And they see the suffering
that we go through,

00:23:31.800 --> 00:23:35.930 align:middle line:84%
because the suffering
we inflict on them,

00:23:35.930 --> 00:23:39.074 align:middle line:84%
they also see happening
in our cultures.

00:23:39.074 --> 00:23:40.620 align:middle line:84%
-Yes.
-You know?

00:23:40.620 --> 00:23:42.521 align:middle line:84%
And you know the
great Credo Mutwa.

00:23:42.521 --> 00:23:43.670 align:middle line:84%
LINDA BENDER: I do.
Yes.

00:23:43.670 --> 00:23:45.010 align:middle line:84%
REGINA MEREDITH: And
I was so surprised

00:23:45.010 --> 00:23:46.660 align:middle line:84%
to learn that just
before the camera started

00:23:46.660 --> 00:23:47.650 align:middle line:84%
running, as a matter of fact.
LINDA BENDER: Yes.

00:23:47.650 --> 00:23:49.216 align:middle line:84%
REGINA MEREDITH: Michael
Telligner, David Eich.

00:23:49.216 --> 00:23:49.970 align:middle line:90%
LINDA BENDER: Yes.

00:23:49.970 --> 00:23:52.660 align:middle line:84%
REGINA MEREDITH: These are
great, great supporters

00:23:52.660 --> 00:23:54.340 align:middle line:90%
of Credo Mutwa's work as well.

00:23:54.340 --> 00:23:55.260 align:middle line:90%
LINDA BENDER: Yes.

00:23:55.260 --> 00:23:57.190 align:middle line:84%
But your connection
with him is specifically

00:23:57.190 --> 00:23:59.611 align:middle line:84%
having to do with the sacredness
of the animal kingdom.

00:23:59.611 --> 00:24:00.310 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

00:24:00.310 --> 00:24:02.940 align:middle line:84%
And I am so very
grateful, because I

00:24:02.940 --> 00:24:06.970 align:middle line:84%
was able to spend a week
with Credo at his home

00:24:06.970 --> 00:24:11.690 align:middle line:84%
and learn from him, and
hear his lifelong stories.

00:24:11.690 --> 00:24:13.030 align:middle line:90%
He's about 94 now.

00:24:13.030 --> 00:24:13.730 align:middle line:90%
REGINA MEREDITH: Yes.

00:24:13.730 --> 00:24:15.885 align:middle line:84%
Except if there are young
women around, he says he's 89.

00:24:15.885 --> 00:24:16.934 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHTER]

00:24:16.934 --> 00:24:18.110 align:middle line:90%
[INAUDIBLE].

00:24:18.110 --> 00:24:22.580 align:middle line:84%
But he's a wonderful
source of shamanic wisdom.

00:24:22.580 --> 00:24:24.910 align:middle line:84%
Well, he's the record keeper
for the Zulu tradition right?

00:24:24.910 --> 00:24:25.950 align:middle line:90%
He truly is.

00:24:25.950 --> 00:24:30.090 align:middle line:84%
But he's also the keeper of
the tragedy and the pain--

00:24:30.090 --> 00:24:30.890 align:middle line:90%
REGINA MEREDITH: Yes.

00:24:30.890 --> 00:24:33.210 align:middle line:84%
---of the animals
and the people.

00:24:33.210 --> 00:24:37.735 align:middle line:84%
And so his stories are
sometimes heartbreaking.

00:24:37.735 --> 00:24:42.780 align:middle line:84%
But I went there specifically
to deepen my sacred connection.

00:24:42.780 --> 00:24:46.721 align:middle line:84%
And I knew that I could learn
more, and more, and more.

00:24:46.721 --> 00:24:47.420 align:middle line:90%
And that he--

00:24:47.420 --> 00:24:48.820 align:middle line:84%
And what did you
take away from there

00:24:48.820 --> 00:24:50.780 align:middle line:90%
that was the most profound?

00:24:50.780 --> 00:24:53.390 align:middle line:90%
He was so inspiring.

00:24:53.390 --> 00:24:56.040 align:middle line:84%
And he said all
of us have a gift.

00:24:56.040 --> 00:24:59.660 align:middle line:84%
All of us have our unique
gift, be it helping animals

00:24:59.660 --> 00:25:01.965 align:middle line:90%
or helping the poor with AIDS.

00:25:01.965 --> 00:25:06.750 align:middle line:84%
He was particularly
active in helping AIDS.

00:25:06.750 --> 00:25:10.590 align:middle line:84%
We must take that
gift very seriously.

00:25:10.590 --> 00:25:13.030 align:middle line:90%
And that becomes our mission.

00:25:13.030 --> 00:25:16.790 align:middle line:90%
That becomes our life.

00:25:16.790 --> 00:25:20.730 align:middle line:84%
We become the warriors,
and a warrior never, ever,

00:25:20.730 --> 00:25:23.536 align:middle line:90%
ever deviates from that path.

00:25:23.536 --> 00:25:24.530 align:middle line:90%
REGINA MEREDITH: Yes.

00:25:24.530 --> 00:25:26.410 align:middle line:90%
We go on, and we go on.

00:25:26.410 --> 00:25:28.840 align:middle line:84%
And we go on not because
we're winning a battle,

00:25:28.840 --> 00:25:32.350 align:middle line:84%
but because we
cannot do otherwise.

00:25:32.350 --> 00:25:33.110 align:middle line:90%
That's beautiful.

00:25:33.110 --> 00:25:34.550 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:25:34.550 --> 00:25:37.740 align:middle line:84%
I wanted to ask you a little
bit ago if you wouldn't mind

00:25:37.740 --> 00:25:39.800 align:middle line:84%
sharing a couple of
those really deep,

00:25:39.800 --> 00:25:42.720 align:middle line:84%
connective experiences
you had with the elephants

00:25:42.720 --> 00:25:44.143 align:middle line:90%
you were referring to.

00:25:44.143 --> 00:25:46.390 align:middle line:90%
Yes, my elephants.

00:25:46.390 --> 00:25:50.150 align:middle line:84%
There was one
particular elephant

00:25:50.150 --> 00:25:55.820 align:middle line:84%
that I visited who
was with one other--

00:25:55.820 --> 00:25:57.860 align:middle line:90%
there were two male elephants.

00:25:57.860 --> 00:26:00.640 align:middle line:84%
This particular elephant
was about 20 years old,

00:26:00.640 --> 00:26:04.210 align:middle line:84%
and there was a
younger one with him.

00:26:04.210 --> 00:26:10.860 align:middle line:84%
And he recognized me on
a very nonverbal level.

00:26:10.860 --> 00:26:15.380 align:middle line:84%
And I must add here that
my connections with animals

00:26:15.380 --> 00:26:16.680 align:middle line:90%
never required words.

00:26:16.680 --> 00:26:19.590 align:middle line:90%


00:26:19.590 --> 00:26:21.800 align:middle line:84%
The entire time
I was growing up,

00:26:21.800 --> 00:26:24.770 align:middle line:84%
through all of my work,
my veterinary work,

00:26:24.770 --> 00:26:29.880 align:middle line:84%
rarely did I ever
need to assign words.

00:26:29.880 --> 00:26:33.270 align:middle line:84%
That only came later, when I had
an encounter, also in Africa,

00:26:33.270 --> 00:26:34.060 align:middle line:90%
with some buffalo.

00:26:34.060 --> 00:26:34.970 align:middle line:90%
REGINA MEREDITH: Yes.

00:26:34.970 --> 00:26:40.810 align:middle line:84%
But I did receive amazing
insight about elephants

00:26:40.810 --> 00:26:45.110 align:middle line:84%
and their capacity
to share wisdom,

00:26:45.110 --> 00:26:47.522 align:middle line:84%
because elephants really
are the symbol of wisdom.

00:26:47.522 --> 00:26:48.755 align:middle line:84%
REGINA MEREDITH:
Wisdom keepers, yes.

00:26:48.755 --> 00:26:50.550 align:middle line:84%
LINDA BENDER: The
wisdom keepers,

00:26:50.550 --> 00:26:52.240 align:middle line:90%
and the ancient traditions.

00:26:52.240 --> 00:26:59.460 align:middle line:84%
And they are-- what these
elephants really explained

00:26:59.460 --> 00:27:04.470 align:middle line:84%
to me nonverbally was
how integrated they are,

00:27:04.470 --> 00:27:07.980 align:middle line:84%
and how connected they are
to the other animal cultures

00:27:07.980 --> 00:27:10.730 align:middle line:84%
that they live and
share the land with.

00:27:10.730 --> 00:27:16.150 align:middle line:84%
And they shared other tidbits
about some of those cultures.

00:27:16.150 --> 00:27:19.530 align:middle line:84%
For example, be careful
to love the birds.

00:27:19.530 --> 00:27:23.620 align:middle line:84%
And then they would talk about
what they loved about birds.

00:27:23.620 --> 00:27:27.240 align:middle line:84%
How the lions loved the birds
and the songs of the birds.

00:27:27.240 --> 00:27:30.185 align:middle line:84%
How we must be mindful of the
giraffe, because the giraffe

00:27:30.185 --> 00:27:31.920 align:middle line:90%
are the tall beings.

00:27:31.920 --> 00:27:37.580 align:middle line:84%
And they watch out and scan
for other predator animals.

00:27:37.580 --> 00:27:41.430 align:middle line:84%
How the giraffe also
connect to the elephants.

00:27:41.430 --> 00:27:44.820 align:middle line:84%
And the elephants
are the matriarchs,

00:27:44.820 --> 00:27:47.940 align:middle line:84%
and the females are always
careful to protect their young.

00:27:47.940 --> 00:27:50.400 align:middle line:84%
Their young stick with the
mother for a good four--

00:27:50.400 --> 00:27:51.300 align:middle line:90%
They're very good mothers.

00:27:51.300 --> 00:27:53.470 align:middle line:84%
---over four years, they
nurse, which is part

00:27:53.470 --> 00:27:55.040 align:middle line:90%
of the problem with poaching.

00:27:55.040 --> 00:27:59.200 align:middle line:84%
If a mom is poached, the infant
will also die unless it's

00:27:59.200 --> 00:28:02.200 align:middle line:90%
over the age of nursing.

00:28:02.200 --> 00:28:07.080 align:middle line:84%
So they shared these
loving sacred stories

00:28:07.080 --> 00:28:09.790 align:middle line:84%
of the connections of these
different animal cultures

00:28:09.790 --> 00:28:10.915 align:middle line:90%
to me.

00:28:10.915 --> 00:28:12.100 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

00:28:12.100 --> 00:28:14.170 align:middle line:84%
What a privilege for you.
LINDA BENDER: It was.

00:28:14.170 --> 00:28:14.880 align:middle line:90%
It still is.

00:28:14.880 --> 00:28:15.780 align:middle line:90%
And thank you for sharing.

00:28:15.780 --> 00:28:16.590 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

00:28:16.590 --> 00:28:18.455 align:middle line:84%
And thank you for
sharing that with us.

00:28:18.455 --> 00:28:19.255 align:middle line:90%
LINDA BENDER: Thank you.

00:28:19.255 --> 00:28:20.521 align:middle line:84%
REGINA MEREDITH: I
mean, I'm with you,

00:28:20.521 --> 00:28:22.960 align:middle line:84%
if we can never get out
among them and be with them.

00:28:22.960 --> 00:28:27.420 align:middle line:84%
And I've only done this
one time in Southeast Asia

00:28:27.420 --> 00:28:28.839 align:middle line:84%
with elephants.
LINDA BENDER: Yes.

00:28:28.839 --> 00:28:31.230 align:middle line:84%
And I was-- we were both,
my husband and I-- it was

00:28:31.230 --> 00:28:32.890 align:middle line:84%
a life-altering experience--
LINDA BENDER: It is.

00:28:32.890 --> 00:28:35.150 align:middle line:90%
---to be among elephants.

00:28:35.150 --> 00:28:36.080 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

00:28:36.080 --> 00:28:38.320 align:middle line:84%
Aside from our
connection with elephants,

00:28:38.320 --> 00:28:40.200 align:middle line:84%
there was a video
that was-- a film

00:28:40.200 --> 00:28:41.520 align:middle line:90%
that was made a while back.

00:28:41.520 --> 00:28:44.060 align:middle line:84%
And again, this is about the
deep, powerful connection

00:28:44.060 --> 00:28:45.900 align:middle line:90%
between humans and wildlife.

00:28:45.900 --> 00:28:47.067 align:middle line:84%
And I know you're
familiar with it.

00:28:47.067 --> 00:28:47.766 align:middle line:90%
LINDA BENDER: Yes.

00:28:47.766 --> 00:28:49.240 align:middle line:84%
And we're going to
show a short clip of it.

00:28:49.240 --> 00:28:52.030 align:middle line:84%
It is the reunion
between man and lion.

00:28:52.030 --> 00:28:52.730 align:middle line:90%
LINDA BENDER: Yes.

00:28:52.730 --> 00:28:54.760 align:middle line:84%
And so let's take a
look at that video.

00:28:54.760 --> 00:28:56.370 align:middle line:90%
These magnificent creatures.

00:28:56.370 --> 00:28:58.200 align:middle line:90%
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:28:58.200 --> 00:29:01.300 align:middle line:84%
MALE SPEAKER 1 : We weren't
sure of our reception this time.

00:29:01.300 --> 00:29:04.170 align:middle line:84%
We always thought
anything could happen.

00:29:04.170 --> 00:29:05.660 align:middle line:90%
It was very dangerous.

00:29:05.660 --> 00:29:08.675 align:middle line:90%
It was the wilds of Africa.

00:29:08.675 --> 00:29:11.560 align:middle line:90%


00:29:11.560 --> 00:29:14.130 align:middle line:84%
NARRATOR: After an anxious
day in the compound,

00:29:14.130 --> 00:29:17.990 align:middle line:84%
Ace and John walked onto
Christian's territory.

00:29:17.990 --> 00:29:20.290 align:middle line:84%
George might be
welcome here, but Ace

00:29:20.290 --> 00:29:22.750 align:middle line:90%
and John were almost strangers.

00:29:22.750 --> 00:29:26.120 align:middle line:84%
They hadn't seen
Christian in a year.

00:29:26.120 --> 00:29:28.980 align:middle line:84%
If he perceived them
as unwelcome guests,

00:29:28.980 --> 00:29:30.110 align:middle line:90%
there could be trouble.

00:29:30.110 --> 00:29:33.510 align:middle line:90%


00:29:33.510 --> 00:29:36.270 align:middle line:84%
MALE SPEAKER 1 : George
appeared on the top of the hill,

00:29:36.270 --> 00:29:39.815 align:middle line:84%
I suppose about 100 meters
away from us, with Christian.

00:29:39.815 --> 00:29:42.350 align:middle line:90%


00:29:42.350 --> 00:29:47.440 align:middle line:84%
Christian ambled down
another 10 or 15 meters,

00:29:47.440 --> 00:29:51.210 align:middle line:84%
and had a very long,
hard look at us.

00:29:51.210 --> 00:29:54.260 align:middle line:90%


00:29:54.260 --> 00:29:59.200 align:middle line:84%
You could just see him
assessing what was going on.

00:29:59.200 --> 00:30:05.401 align:middle line:90%


00:30:05.401 --> 00:30:09.790 align:middle line:84%
He kept walking slowly,
slowly down towards us.

00:30:09.790 --> 00:30:12.660 align:middle line:90%


00:30:12.660 --> 00:30:16.500 align:middle line:84%
And I think that was the
point where we actually

00:30:16.500 --> 00:30:19.940 align:middle line:84%
couldn't bear it any longer, and
actually called out his name.

00:30:19.940 --> 00:30:25.520 align:middle line:90%


00:30:25.520 --> 00:30:28.720 align:middle line:84%
And at that moment,
the pace picks up.

00:30:28.720 --> 00:30:32.206 align:middle line:90%
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:30:32.206 --> 00:30:51.628 align:middle line:90%


00:30:51.628 --> 00:30:53.372 align:middle line:84%
MALE SPEAKER 2:
And he was just so,

00:30:53.372 --> 00:30:56.580 align:middle line:84%
so excited, because we were.
[INAUDIBLE]

00:30:56.580 --> 00:31:03.885 align:middle line:90%


00:31:03.885 --> 00:31:07.510 align:middle line:84%
MALE SPEAKER 1 : It it's
just an incredible reunion.

00:31:07.510 --> 00:31:10.960 align:middle line:84%
Whether we were human or he was
animal was totally irrelevant.

00:31:10.960 --> 00:31:17.373 align:middle line:90%


00:31:17.373 --> 00:31:19.728 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHTER]

00:31:19.728 --> 00:31:20.930 align:middle line:90%
Oh my god.

00:31:20.930 --> 00:31:24.610 align:middle line:84%
To me, that is one of the
most joyful films ever.

00:31:24.610 --> 00:31:25.950 align:middle line:84%
It still brings
tears to my eyes--

00:31:25.950 --> 00:31:26.650 align:middle line:90%
Oh my gosh, me too.

00:31:26.650 --> 00:31:28.660 align:middle line:84%
--[INAUDIBLE] times
since I've seen it.

00:31:28.660 --> 00:31:31.311 align:middle line:84%
And I just have to
say, I rest my case.

00:31:31.311 --> 00:31:32.010 align:middle line:90%
Exactly.

00:31:32.010 --> 00:31:38.341 align:middle line:84%
Anyone who doubts the emotional
and loving capacity of animals.

00:31:38.341 --> 00:31:39.040 align:middle line:90%
Of animals.

00:31:39.040 --> 00:31:41.331 align:middle line:84%
After everything we have done
to them and their environment--

00:31:41.331 --> 00:31:42.030 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

00:31:42.030 --> 00:31:45.361 align:middle line:84%
---to still show up with a
completely open heart for us.

00:31:45.361 --> 00:31:47.140 align:middle line:84%
-Yes.
-Well, OK.

00:31:47.140 --> 00:31:47.840 align:middle line:90%
LINDA BENDER: Yes.

00:31:47.840 --> 00:31:51.400 align:middle line:84%
That is-- and you have a
personal lion story too.

00:31:51.400 --> 00:31:55.840 align:middle line:10%
Well, I have many lion stories,
but there's one I would like

00:31:55.840 --> 00:32:01.570 align:middle line:10%
to share, because as we just
witnessed, the great love--

00:32:01.570 --> 00:32:08.230 align:middle line:10%
and I'm getting a little
[INAUDIBLE] worked

00:32:08.230 --> 00:32:10.040 align:middle line:10%
up over that precious moment--

00:32:10.040 --> 00:32:10.740 align:middle line:10%
REGINA MEREDITH: Yes.

00:32:10.740 --> 00:32:13.410 align:middle line:90%
---as I think we all should.

00:32:13.410 --> 00:32:17.960 align:middle line:84%
But we do identify
lions with courage.

00:32:17.960 --> 00:32:23.060 align:middle line:84%
We identify lions with heart,
with so many of those words

00:32:23.060 --> 00:32:26.000 align:middle line:90%
to have become over used.

00:32:26.000 --> 00:32:32.250 align:middle line:84%
But I would invite you
to take it a step deeper

00:32:32.250 --> 00:32:39.570 align:middle line:84%
and allow lions to share a more
sacred meaning of what it means

00:32:39.570 --> 00:32:42.480 align:middle line:84%
to be courageous, what
it means to be loving,

00:32:42.480 --> 00:32:46.280 align:middle line:84%
and what it means
to be prideful.

00:32:46.280 --> 00:32:49.760 align:middle line:84%
And from the level of
the heart and the soul,

00:32:49.760 --> 00:32:52.900 align:middle line:84%
what lions teach us
is, as the beings

00:32:52.900 --> 00:32:56.420 align:middle line:84%
who are the top of the
mountain, the ones who watch

00:32:56.420 --> 00:33:00.160 align:middle line:84%
over all beings
in their kingdom,

00:33:00.160 --> 00:33:02.515 align:middle line:84%
they are the great
beings of courage.

00:33:02.515 --> 00:33:06.160 align:middle line:84%
And courage to me, through my
life with working with animals,

00:33:06.160 --> 00:33:10.070 align:middle line:84%
has always been courage is
not getting rid of fear.

00:33:10.070 --> 00:33:13.980 align:middle line:84%
Courage, as lions know courage,
is courage to look fear

00:33:13.980 --> 00:33:15.150 align:middle line:90%
in the face.

00:33:15.150 --> 00:33:16.546 align:middle line:90%
And who is this?

00:33:16.546 --> 00:33:24.750 align:middle line:84%
This is a most magnificent
white lion from the Timbavati

00:33:24.750 --> 00:33:26.990 align:middle line:90%
area of South Africa.

00:33:26.990 --> 00:33:31.940 align:middle line:84%
This particular
lion in this photo

00:33:31.940 --> 00:33:38.200 align:middle line:84%
is demonstrating the
majestic lion quality.

00:33:38.200 --> 00:33:44.480 align:middle line:84%
I'd like to tell you that this
beautiful lion had this photo

00:33:44.480 --> 00:33:51.090 align:middle line:84%
taken as he was released
from a hunting camp,

00:33:51.090 --> 00:33:54.170 align:middle line:90%
where he spent his entire life.

00:33:54.170 --> 00:33:58.421 align:middle line:84%
He had never been out
of a dark caged area.

00:33:58.421 --> 00:33:59.120 align:middle line:90%
Really?

00:33:59.120 --> 00:34:04.790 align:middle line:84%
He was raised to be part
of the hunting trade.

00:34:04.790 --> 00:34:08.230 align:middle line:84%
And this photo was
taken when he was

00:34:08.230 --> 00:34:13.340 align:middle line:84%
rescued, and stepped
onto real ground

00:34:13.340 --> 00:34:14.929 align:middle line:90%
for the first time in his life.

00:34:14.929 --> 00:34:17.054 align:middle line:90%
And he was 11 years old.

00:34:17.054 --> 00:34:19.489 align:middle line:90%
REGINA MEREDITH: Oh my god.

00:34:19.489 --> 00:34:24.960 align:middle line:84%
That-- that's-- look
at his eyes, his face.

00:34:24.960 --> 00:34:26.797 align:middle line:84%
LINDA BENDER: This is
the face of courage.

00:34:26.797 --> 00:34:27.730 align:middle line:90%
REGINA MEREDITH: Oh my gosh.

00:34:27.730 --> 00:34:30.960 align:middle line:84%
It's just so powerful,
overwhelmingly powerful.

00:34:30.960 --> 00:34:33.030 align:middle line:84%
Thank you for
sharing that story.

00:34:33.030 --> 00:34:36.050 align:middle line:84%
And there are a lot
of others like him

00:34:36.050 --> 00:34:37.671 align:middle line:84%
that are living that
same kind of existence.

00:34:37.671 --> 00:34:38.370 align:middle line:90%
LINDA BENDER: Yes.

00:34:38.370 --> 00:34:40.130 align:middle line:84%
Not allowed to roam
their own land anymore.

00:34:40.130 --> 00:34:42.850 align:middle line:84%
And this is the only
place in the world

00:34:42.850 --> 00:34:47.080 align:middle line:84%
that these sacred lions
have ever, ever lived.

00:34:47.080 --> 00:34:49.730 align:middle line:84%
And the shamans, the
indigenous people,

00:34:49.730 --> 00:34:54.570 align:middle line:84%
have wonderful sacred stories
about them as the star beings--

00:34:54.570 --> 00:35:00.030 align:middle line:84%
and have many, many, many sacred
stories about those beings.

00:35:00.030 --> 00:35:03.100 align:middle line:84%
As connected to other star
systems that have come here--

00:35:03.100 --> 00:35:03.900 align:middle line:90%
LINDA BENDER: Come here.

00:35:03.900 --> 00:35:05.430 align:middle line:90%
---for a particular teaching.

00:35:05.430 --> 00:35:06.260 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

00:35:06.260 --> 00:35:08.250 align:middle line:90%
Yes, to help humanity.

00:35:08.250 --> 00:35:09.930 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

00:35:09.930 --> 00:35:14.750 align:middle line:84%
And some believe, and the
indigenous people in particular

00:35:14.750 --> 00:35:17.700 align:middle line:84%
believe, that if at some
point the white lions

00:35:17.700 --> 00:35:21.170 align:middle line:84%
leave the face of
the earth, the future

00:35:21.170 --> 00:35:22.980 align:middle line:90%
is very dark for all of us.

00:35:22.980 --> 00:35:27.570 align:middle line:84%
So people are working very
hard to have this not happen.

00:35:27.570 --> 00:35:29.040 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

00:35:29.040 --> 00:35:30.280 align:middle line:90%
Thank you.

00:35:30.280 --> 00:35:34.120 align:middle line:84%
Now, what I'd like to do is
after all that-- so it's all

00:35:34.120 --> 00:35:37.360 align:middle line:84%
so powerful, so emotional--
is turn our conversation

00:35:37.360 --> 00:35:38.720 align:middle line:84%
to something equally
as emotional,

00:35:38.720 --> 00:35:42.170 align:middle line:84%
and that is our dear little
pets-- the domesticated ones

00:35:42.170 --> 00:35:43.540 align:middle line:84%
that are no longer
in the wild, that

00:35:43.540 --> 00:35:47.011 align:middle line:84%
live alongside us, whom you
have dealt with for a lifetime.

00:35:47.011 --> 00:35:47.980 align:middle line:84%
LINDA BENDER: Yes.
Yes.

00:35:47.980 --> 00:35:51.320 align:middle line:84%
And I would like to start
out by finding-- maybe we'll

00:35:51.320 --> 00:35:54.070 align:middle line:84%
start at the beginning with
talking about some more

00:35:54.070 --> 00:35:58.330 align:middle line:84%
challenging aspects of having
dealt with all of us bringing

00:35:58.330 --> 00:36:01.120 align:middle line:84%
our little broken
animals to you as a vet

00:36:01.120 --> 00:36:03.880 align:middle line:84%
when you can talk with them
and communicate in this way.

00:36:03.880 --> 00:36:04.770 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

00:36:04.770 --> 00:36:10.960 align:middle line:84%
I particularly love when
people bring in injured birds,

00:36:10.960 --> 00:36:12.690 align:middle line:90%
injured wildlife.

00:36:12.690 --> 00:36:14.470 align:middle line:90%
And then they apologize for it.

00:36:14.470 --> 00:36:16.050 align:middle line:84%
And I give them
my little tutorial

00:36:16.050 --> 00:36:17.330 align:middle line:90%
about please don't do that.

00:36:17.330 --> 00:36:18.480 align:middle line:90%
We need people like you.

00:36:18.480 --> 00:36:20.850 align:middle line:84%
You're really brave
and wonderful.

00:36:20.850 --> 00:36:25.010 align:middle line:84%
And oh gosh, there's
so many stories.

00:36:25.010 --> 00:36:32.179 align:middle line:84%
But the ones I find
the hardest are still

00:36:32.179 --> 00:36:37.630 align:middle line:84%
are people when they bring
their pets in for euthanasia.

00:36:37.630 --> 00:36:40.090 align:middle line:84%
Yes, that is a topic
I wanted to spend

00:36:40.090 --> 00:36:44.271 align:middle line:84%
some time on that is a very
difficult topic for everyone.

00:36:44.271 --> 00:36:44.970 align:middle line:90%
It is.

00:36:44.970 --> 00:36:50.660 align:middle line:84%
And so many people have pets--
as I say, companion animals.

00:36:50.660 --> 00:36:53.020 align:middle line:84%
So many people
have dogs and cats.

00:36:53.020 --> 00:36:56.240 align:middle line:84%
And those dogs and
cats, you know,

00:36:56.240 --> 00:36:59.320 align:middle line:84%
dogs and cats used
to be outside.

00:36:59.320 --> 00:37:03.290 align:middle line:84%
Dogs used to be
out in dog houses.

00:37:03.290 --> 00:37:04.590 align:middle line:90%
Not anymore.

00:37:04.590 --> 00:37:06.715 align:middle line:84%
They're not only in our
homes, they're in our beds.

00:37:06.715 --> 00:37:07.470 align:middle line:90%
Right.

00:37:07.470 --> 00:37:09.700 align:middle line:84%
You know, they're
not Fido anymore.

00:37:09.700 --> 00:37:12.870 align:middle line:84%
They're given names as
children would be given names.

00:37:12.870 --> 00:37:14.305 align:middle line:84%
-Yeah, like Eric.
-Eric.

00:37:14.305 --> 00:37:15.821 align:middle line:84%
[LAUGHS]
-Yes.

00:37:15.821 --> 00:37:17.470 align:middle line:84%
-Right.
-Patty, Susan, whatever.

00:37:17.470 --> 00:37:19.880 align:middle line:84%
REGINA MEREDITH:
Yeah, that is true.

00:37:19.880 --> 00:37:24.100 align:middle line:84%
So these are dearly
beloved family members.

00:37:24.100 --> 00:37:27.060 align:middle line:84%
And when their lives
come toward the end,

00:37:27.060 --> 00:37:32.290 align:middle line:84%
this is often as
difficult-- how to handle

00:37:32.290 --> 00:37:36.720 align:middle line:84%
these situations, as it is with
any other human family member.

00:37:36.720 --> 00:37:40.271 align:middle line:84%
And there's so much
pain involved in it.

00:37:40.271 --> 00:37:40.970 align:middle line:90%
There is.

00:37:40.970 --> 00:37:42.701 align:middle line:84%
And it's such a
confused-- I mean--

00:37:42.701 --> 00:37:43.400 align:middle line:90%
LINDA BENDER: It is.

00:37:43.400 --> 00:37:46.460 align:middle line:84%
---I've gone through the passing
of our dog Finbar recently,

00:37:46.460 --> 00:37:47.820 align:middle line:84%
which I'll share
that story with you.

00:37:47.820 --> 00:37:54.930 align:middle line:84%
But many years prior, I
dealt with my first real,

00:37:54.930 --> 00:37:57.090 align:middle line:84%
I mean, soul mate dog.
LINDA BENDER: Yes.

00:37:57.090 --> 00:37:58.740 align:middle line:90%
I've had many dogs I love.

00:37:58.740 --> 00:38:00.130 align:middle line:90%
I've had them my whole life.

00:38:00.130 --> 00:38:04.950 align:middle line:84%
But this one, named Sugar Bear,
who was a [INAUDIBLE] mix,

00:38:04.950 --> 00:38:06.495 align:middle line:90%
we were just bound together.

00:38:06.495 --> 00:38:11.390 align:middle line:84%
And through a circumstance
that occurred, she aged.

00:38:11.390 --> 00:38:13.340 align:middle line:84%
And through some
stress that happened

00:38:13.340 --> 00:38:16.340 align:middle line:84%
in my life, which transferred
to her, she developed cancer.

00:38:16.340 --> 00:38:19.430 align:middle line:84%
And of course, I did the
last-minute lifesaving

00:38:19.430 --> 00:38:20.790 align:middle line:90%
operation, had it done.

00:38:20.790 --> 00:38:22.340 align:middle line:84%
I just couldn't
bear to let her go.

00:38:22.340 --> 00:38:23.039 align:middle line:90%
LINDA BENDER: Right.

00:38:23.039 --> 00:38:26.650 align:middle line:84%
And it only bought her an
extra couple weeks at most.

00:38:26.650 --> 00:38:30.980 align:middle line:84%
And the vet told me, now, if
you see her gums go white,

00:38:30.980 --> 00:38:33.590 align:middle line:84%
and she starts becoming weak,
there's nothing more we can do.

00:38:33.590 --> 00:38:34.911 align:middle line:84%
She's having internal
hemorrhaging.

00:38:34.911 --> 00:38:37.380 align:middle line:84%
LINDA BENDER: Right.
-So that day did come.

00:38:37.380 --> 00:38:40.190 align:middle line:84%
And they said, you might
want to bring her in, then,

00:38:40.190 --> 00:38:42.040 align:middle line:84%
and no have her go
through that suffering.

00:38:42.040 --> 00:38:45.020 align:middle line:84%
Well, I hadn't dealt with
anything like this before.

00:38:45.020 --> 00:38:45.720 align:middle line:90%
LINDA BENDER: Right.

00:38:45.720 --> 00:38:47.890 align:middle line:90%
I did take her in.

00:38:47.890 --> 00:38:51.100 align:middle line:84%
But I stopped at the park
first, and let her out

00:38:51.100 --> 00:38:54.220 align:middle line:84%
of the car-- she could barely
even get out-- just to see

00:38:54.220 --> 00:38:55.610 align:middle line:84%
if she'd chase the
squirrels, which

00:38:55.610 --> 00:38:56.820 align:middle line:90%
was her favorite thing to do.

00:38:56.820 --> 00:39:00.560 align:middle line:84%
I thought if she won't chase
the squirrels, it's really over.

00:39:00.560 --> 00:39:02.651 align:middle line:84%
I was just looking for
intervention of some kind.

00:39:02.651 --> 00:39:03.350 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

00:39:03.350 --> 00:39:06.350 align:middle line:84%
And so when I took her
in, I couldn't bear it.

00:39:06.350 --> 00:39:08.210 align:middle line:84%
And they said, I
don't think you want

00:39:08.210 --> 00:39:09.335 align:middle line:90%
to be here when this happens.

00:39:09.335 --> 00:39:10.967 align:middle line:90%
And this was a long time ago.

00:39:10.967 --> 00:39:11.900 align:middle line:90%
LINDA BENDER: Long time ago.

00:39:11.900 --> 00:39:12.800 align:middle line:90%
And they took her.

00:39:12.800 --> 00:39:14.390 align:middle line:84%
And she turned back
and looked at me.

00:39:14.390 --> 00:39:17.140 align:middle line:84%
And that's the most
haunting, horrible moment.

00:39:17.140 --> 00:39:19.000 align:middle line:84%
I have never gotten
over it in my lifetime.

00:39:19.000 --> 00:39:20.030 align:middle line:90%
I wasn't with her.

00:39:20.030 --> 00:39:20.790 align:middle line:90%
Right.

00:39:20.790 --> 00:39:21.760 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

00:39:21.760 --> 00:39:24.050 align:middle line:84%
-This is not uncommon.
-No.

00:39:24.050 --> 00:39:27.021 align:middle line:84%
And you still have
that vision of leaving.

00:39:27.021 --> 00:39:30.170 align:middle line:84%
Yes.
And this is our beloved Finbar.

00:39:30.170 --> 00:39:33.960 align:middle line:84%
Finbar just died
about five weeks ago.

00:39:33.960 --> 00:39:36.830 align:middle line:84%
He was an older fellow, but he
looked that beautiful right up

00:39:36.830 --> 00:39:39.310 align:middle line:90%
to the very, very end.

00:39:39.310 --> 00:39:41.160 align:middle line:84%
And this is one of
those situations

00:39:41.160 --> 00:39:43.280 align:middle line:84%
where after Sugar
Bear, I decided

00:39:43.280 --> 00:39:45.340 align:middle line:84%
I didn't want to do that again.
-Yes.

00:39:45.340 --> 00:39:48.540 align:middle line:84%
And so we let him go through
kind of the normal process,

00:39:48.540 --> 00:39:50.170 align:middle line:90%
but we kept intervening.

00:39:50.170 --> 00:39:54.140 align:middle line:84%
Thousands of dollars
later, IVs, staying

00:39:54.140 --> 00:39:56.640 align:middle line:84%
at the vet's office
for days at a time,

00:39:56.640 --> 00:39:58.390 align:middle line:84%
did not really buy him time.
LINDA BENDER: Right.

00:39:58.390 --> 00:40:01.490 align:middle line:84%
He was trying to crawl out to
a little area under the deck,

00:40:01.490 --> 00:40:05.300 align:middle line:84%
and be in the dirt
by himself, and go.

00:40:05.300 --> 00:40:06.510 align:middle line:90%
But we didn't know.

00:40:06.510 --> 00:40:08.920 align:middle line:84%
That brings up all
these questions.

00:40:08.920 --> 00:40:10.420 align:middle line:90%
LINDA BENDER: Yes.

00:40:10.420 --> 00:40:12.200 align:middle line:90%
When do you really listen?

00:40:12.200 --> 00:40:14.350 align:middle line:84%
When should we have
known that Finbar just--

00:40:14.350 --> 00:40:15.811 align:middle line:84%
we needed to leave him alone?
-Right.

00:40:15.811 --> 00:40:16.510 align:middle line:90%
Right.

00:40:16.510 --> 00:40:20.990 align:middle line:84%
Well, unfortunately, there
is not a simple answer

00:40:20.990 --> 00:40:21.920 align:middle line:90%
to this question.

00:40:21.920 --> 00:40:27.670 align:middle line:84%
But once again, I come back
to a life of heart connection

00:40:27.670 --> 00:40:29.350 align:middle line:90%
to animals.

00:40:29.350 --> 00:40:32.910 align:middle line:84%
And I believe, and I've often
advised this to people who

00:40:32.910 --> 00:40:34.660 align:middle line:90%
say to me, when will I know?

00:40:34.660 --> 00:40:36.230 align:middle line:90%
When will I know?

00:40:36.230 --> 00:40:40.440 align:middle line:84%
And I often say to people-- I
look deeply into them so they

00:40:40.440 --> 00:40:43.120 align:middle line:90%
really hear from their hearts.

00:40:43.120 --> 00:40:49.870 align:middle line:84%
And I say, you will know if you
pay attention and you listen.

00:40:49.870 --> 00:40:53.420 align:middle line:84%
Or if you don't go into fear
and let that override you.

00:40:53.420 --> 00:40:56.780 align:middle line:84%
Listen to the heart
connection from your animal.

00:40:56.780 --> 00:40:58.340 align:middle line:90%
And there will be signs.

00:40:58.340 --> 00:41:01.556 align:middle line:84%
You know, there are
the usual signs.

00:41:01.556 --> 00:41:03.390 align:middle line:90%
You know, not eating as much.

00:41:03.390 --> 00:41:05.290 align:middle line:90%
They're the basic things.

00:41:05.290 --> 00:41:06.590 align:middle line:84%
Well, this was way
past all the signs.

00:41:06.590 --> 00:41:07.590 align:middle line:84%
Right.
He had those.

00:41:07.590 --> 00:41:09.030 align:middle line:84%
And he hadn't
been really eating.

00:41:09.030 --> 00:41:11.000 align:middle line:84%
We'd been feeding him
with a turkey baster,

00:41:11.000 --> 00:41:12.731 align:middle line:84%
little protein shakes
just to keep him alive.

00:41:12.731 --> 00:41:13.690 align:middle line:84%
LINDA BENDER: Right.
Right.

00:41:13.690 --> 00:41:15.660 align:middle line:84%
And it wasn't-- I mean,
I look back and think,

00:41:15.660 --> 00:41:17.861 align:middle line:84%
what an undignified
thing to put him through.

00:41:17.861 --> 00:41:18.560 align:middle line:90%
Right.

00:41:18.560 --> 00:41:21.680 align:middle line:84%
So we go through all
those medical signals.

00:41:21.680 --> 00:41:25.160 align:middle line:84%
And then there's still that
time when they may be lingering.

00:41:25.160 --> 00:41:28.730 align:middle line:84%
And I do believe that
animals, especially dogs

00:41:28.730 --> 00:41:31.180 align:middle line:84%
and that loving,
loving connection,

00:41:31.180 --> 00:41:34.890 align:middle line:84%
and that bond that is so
close with their owner,

00:41:34.890 --> 00:41:37.190 align:middle line:90%
they want so much to please.

00:41:37.190 --> 00:41:39.080 align:middle line:84%
And they want to stay--
REGINA MEREDITH: Yes.

00:41:39.080 --> 00:41:41.200 align:middle line:84%
---because they see
that you need them.

00:41:41.200 --> 00:41:43.490 align:middle line:84%
And that's the
confusing point, where

00:41:43.490 --> 00:41:45.170 align:middle line:90%
you keep trying to save them.

00:41:45.170 --> 00:41:48.260 align:middle line:84%
We keep trying to save
them, and they perhaps--

00:41:48.260 --> 00:41:53.160 align:middle line:84%
you know, they, in my
experience-- animals live

00:41:53.160 --> 00:41:57.750 align:middle line:84%
in a connection that is more
connected to the universal

00:41:57.750 --> 00:41:59.910 align:middle line:90%
connectedness than humans.

00:41:59.910 --> 00:42:00.810 align:middle line:90%
Yes, by far.

00:42:00.810 --> 00:42:03.980 align:middle line:84%
So I think they're
slightly more tuned in.

00:42:03.980 --> 00:42:05.420 align:middle line:90%
Animals experience fear.

00:42:05.420 --> 00:42:06.390 align:middle line:90%
Don't get me wrong.

00:42:06.390 --> 00:42:11.050 align:middle line:84%
But I don't think that they
are as afraid to let go.

00:42:11.050 --> 00:42:14.490 align:middle line:84%
And their main concern
is our well being.

00:42:14.490 --> 00:42:16.080 align:middle line:90%
REGINA MEREDITH: Yes.

00:42:16.080 --> 00:42:19.710 align:middle line:84%
So we need to do our
part to help them along.

00:42:19.710 --> 00:42:21.750 align:middle line:84%
So in a situation
like this, which other

00:42:21.750 --> 00:42:23.449 align:middle line:84%
people have been through--
-A lot of them.

00:42:23.449 --> 00:42:24.320 align:middle line:90%
---he's an older dog.

00:42:24.320 --> 00:42:26.040 align:middle line:84%
He stopped eating.
-Yes.

00:42:26.040 --> 00:42:27.980 align:middle line:90%
He's seems to be in pain now.

00:42:27.980 --> 00:42:28.850 align:middle line:84%
LINDA BENDER: Yes.
Yes.

00:42:28.850 --> 00:42:29.884 align:middle line:84%
You know?
LINDA BENDER: Right.

00:42:29.884 --> 00:42:31.290 align:middle line:84%
What do you do?
You just [INAUDIBLE]?

00:42:31.290 --> 00:42:33.177 align:middle line:84%
You can cut back
on the heroics.

00:42:33.177 --> 00:42:33.910 align:middle line:90%
REGINA MEREDITH: Yeah.

00:42:33.910 --> 00:42:35.210 align:middle line:90%
Cut back on the heroics.

00:42:35.210 --> 00:42:39.130 align:middle line:84%
And I have been-- for someone
who knows what I know,

00:42:39.130 --> 00:42:42.670 align:middle line:84%
I've been one to
push too far as well.

00:42:42.670 --> 00:42:46.150 align:middle line:84%
And then I'm reminded,
no, this is not about me.

00:42:46.150 --> 00:42:47.020 align:middle line:90%
REGINA MEREDITH: Right.

00:42:47.020 --> 00:42:51.260 align:middle line:84%
It is about this being and
the quality of their life.

00:42:51.260 --> 00:42:55.140 align:middle line:84%
So we need to stop the
heroics to the extent we do.

00:42:55.140 --> 00:42:56.400 align:middle line:90%
And you're right.

00:42:56.400 --> 00:42:59.040 align:middle line:84%
When he hadn't eaten for
a week, then two weeks,

00:42:59.040 --> 00:43:01.030 align:middle line:84%
I mean, that's a hint.
LINDA BENDER: Right.

00:43:01.030 --> 00:43:01.730 align:middle line:90%
He's done.

00:43:01.730 --> 00:43:02.710 align:middle line:90%
LINDA BENDER: Right.

00:43:02.710 --> 00:43:04.850 align:middle line:84%
And there are two things that
I would like to bring up.

00:43:04.850 --> 00:43:09.120 align:middle line:84%
One is how we address the
situation of when we do

00:43:09.120 --> 00:43:12.591 align:middle line:84%
need to help that process
along with euthanasia.

00:43:12.591 --> 00:43:13.290 align:middle line:90%
REGINA MEREDITH: Yes.

00:43:13.290 --> 00:43:23.720 align:middle line:84%
And also, you know, what we
can do to learn from animals

00:43:23.720 --> 00:43:25.430 align:middle line:84%
about the process
of dying-- you know,

00:43:25.430 --> 00:43:28.690 align:middle line:84%
they, unfortunately, don't
live as long as we do--

00:43:28.690 --> 00:43:32.281 align:middle line:84%
and what they're trying to teach
us about that dying process.

00:43:32.281 --> 00:43:33.990 align:middle line:84%
-For sure.
-Yeah.

00:43:33.990 --> 00:43:37.100 align:middle line:84%
And I learned-- I
could share a story--

00:43:37.100 --> 00:43:38.600 align:middle line:84%
REGINA MEREDITH: Please
do, because you had--

00:43:38.600 --> 00:43:40.540 align:middle line:84%
---of my dog Pepper.
-Pepper.

00:43:40.540 --> 00:43:42.421 align:middle line:84%
And Pepper's only been
gone about six months.

00:43:42.421 --> 00:43:43.120 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

00:43:43.120 --> 00:43:46.400 align:middle line:84%
And Pepper was one of my
dearest, dearest friends,

00:43:46.400 --> 00:43:47.190 align:middle line:90%
and still is.

00:43:47.190 --> 00:43:49.560 align:middle line:84%
We have a picture of
you and Pepper together.

00:43:49.560 --> 00:43:50.430 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

00:43:50.430 --> 00:43:57.890 align:middle line:84%
But Pepper was-- again, he
found me many, many years ago.

00:43:57.890 --> 00:44:02.420 align:middle line:84%
But he had a history
of autoimmune problems.

00:44:02.420 --> 00:44:04.630 align:middle line:84%
So I worked with
that over the years.

00:44:04.630 --> 00:44:09.090 align:middle line:84%
And it's a question of what I
can fix and what I can't fix,

00:44:09.090 --> 00:44:12.130 align:middle line:84%
using all different
types of methods,

00:44:12.130 --> 00:44:16.630 align:middle line:84%
traditional and alternative,
diet, all those things,

00:44:16.630 --> 00:44:18.670 align:middle line:90%
to keep your animal healthy.

00:44:18.670 --> 00:44:25.010 align:middle line:84%
And so Pepper, as he advanced in
years, had a series of issues.

00:44:25.010 --> 00:44:31.010 align:middle line:84%
And in the last year of his
life, I got up one morning.

00:44:31.010 --> 00:44:36.000 align:middle line:84%
And instead of him greeting
me at the food dish,

00:44:36.000 --> 00:44:38.420 align:middle line:84%
he was completely
flat on his side.

00:44:38.420 --> 00:44:41.050 align:middle line:84%
I thought, oh my god,
he wasn't moving.

00:44:41.050 --> 00:44:41.980 align:middle line:90%
I thought he was dead.

00:44:41.980 --> 00:44:44.630 align:middle line:90%
I ran over, felt this heart.

00:44:44.630 --> 00:44:47.130 align:middle line:90%
He was still barely breathing.

00:44:47.130 --> 00:44:49.660 align:middle line:84%
And I thought, I don't
know what's going on.

00:44:49.660 --> 00:44:51.360 align:middle line:90%
This is a critical situation.

00:44:51.360 --> 00:44:52.830 align:middle line:90%
Should I just leave him?

00:44:52.830 --> 00:44:57.050 align:middle line:84%
Should I grab him, throw him in
the car, get him to the clinic

00:44:57.050 --> 00:44:58.660 align:middle line:90%
quickly?

00:44:58.660 --> 00:45:02.570 align:middle line:84%
I chose-- in my pajamas, lifted
him up, put him in my car,

00:45:02.570 --> 00:45:03.930 align:middle line:90%
got him to the clinic quickly.

00:45:03.930 --> 00:45:07.120 align:middle line:84%
And in that case, it was
the wise thing to do.

00:45:07.120 --> 00:45:08.660 align:middle line:90%
I did go for it.

00:45:08.660 --> 00:45:09.595 align:middle line:90%
I used my intuition.

00:45:09.595 --> 00:45:13.640 align:middle line:84%
It turned out he had a tumor in
his spleen that had ruptured,

00:45:13.640 --> 00:45:15.060 align:middle line:90%
so he was bleeding out.

00:45:15.060 --> 00:45:16.520 align:middle line:90%
We quickly got him in the OR.

00:45:16.520 --> 00:45:18.160 align:middle line:84%
Of course, I didn't
do any of this.

00:45:18.160 --> 00:45:19.480 align:middle line:90%
Right.

00:45:19.480 --> 00:45:21.200 align:middle line:84%
Your hands might
have been unsteady.

00:45:21.200 --> 00:45:26.250 align:middle line:84%
But a dear friend did bring
him back, and he was fine.

00:45:26.250 --> 00:45:27.690 align:middle line:90%
He was good as new.

00:45:27.690 --> 00:45:30.570 align:middle line:84%
He went through a series
of other critical issues.

00:45:30.570 --> 00:45:34.110 align:middle line:90%
So again, when do we know?

00:45:34.110 --> 00:45:40.240 align:middle line:84%
But in the end, Pepper went
downhill fairly quickly.

00:45:40.240 --> 00:45:42.810 align:middle line:90%
I ran a few diagnostics on him.

00:45:42.810 --> 00:45:44.960 align:middle line:84%
We couldn't figure
out what was wrong.

00:45:44.960 --> 00:45:46.040 align:middle line:90%
I then looked at Pepper.

00:45:46.040 --> 00:45:47.800 align:middle line:90%
Pepper looked at me.

00:45:47.800 --> 00:45:52.956 align:middle line:84%
I knew I could no longer keep
this body going, nor could he.

00:45:52.956 --> 00:45:58.110 align:middle line:84%
He indicated
through me listening

00:45:58.110 --> 00:46:02.950 align:middle line:90%
that his body was wearing out.

00:46:02.950 --> 00:46:06.780 align:middle line:84%
The important thing I did
with him was completely

00:46:06.780 --> 00:46:10.570 align:middle line:84%
go out of a different
mode of thinking into how

00:46:10.570 --> 00:46:11.780 align:middle line:90%
can I make you comfortable.

00:46:11.780 --> 00:46:12.800 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

00:46:12.800 --> 00:46:13.910 align:middle line:90%
I stayed with him.

00:46:13.910 --> 00:46:15.070 align:middle line:90%
We hugged.

00:46:15.070 --> 00:46:17.470 align:middle line:84%
He used to love
to tuck his head.

00:46:17.470 --> 00:46:19.640 align:middle line:84%
We just clicked into
that mode of how

00:46:19.640 --> 00:46:21.780 align:middle line:90%
can we make the end better.

00:46:21.780 --> 00:46:23.890 align:middle line:90%
And he did die in my arms.

00:46:23.890 --> 00:46:26.760 align:middle line:84%
And now, like you
and your last case,

00:46:26.760 --> 00:46:28.930 align:middle line:84%
when I look back at
Pepper, and I remember,

00:46:28.930 --> 00:46:31.140 align:middle line:90%
I do think of that end moment.

00:46:31.140 --> 00:46:33.550 align:middle line:84%
But I have tremendous
consolation knowing

00:46:33.550 --> 00:46:34.620 align:middle line:90%
that I was there with him.

00:46:34.620 --> 00:46:36.260 align:middle line:84%
Yes, the end moments
are hard when you

00:46:36.260 --> 00:46:37.450 align:middle line:90%
allow it to happen naturally.

00:46:37.450 --> 00:46:40.305 align:middle line:84%
Euthanasia is
less-- emotionally,

00:46:40.305 --> 00:46:44.640 align:middle line:84%
a very traumatic decision, but
it is less difficult to watch

00:46:44.640 --> 00:46:47.446 align:middle line:84%
than it is when you see Pepper,
or in this case, Finbar, die

00:46:47.446 --> 00:46:49.180 align:middle line:84%
naturally.
-Yes.

00:46:49.180 --> 00:46:50.140 align:middle line:90%
But as you say--

00:46:50.140 --> 00:46:53.890 align:middle line:84%
So many people, loving
their animals so much,

00:46:53.890 --> 00:46:56.880 align:middle line:84%
find it too difficult
to go to the vet

00:46:56.880 --> 00:46:59.660 align:middle line:84%
when they know
intervention is needed.

00:46:59.660 --> 00:47:02.820 align:middle line:84%
And what I would
like people to know

00:47:02.820 --> 00:47:06.030 align:middle line:84%
is that animal needs
you at that moment

00:47:06.030 --> 00:47:09.050 align:middle line:84%
more than any other
time in its life,

00:47:09.050 --> 00:47:10.972 align:middle line:90%
and that it isn't about you.

00:47:10.972 --> 00:47:15.200 align:middle line:84%
You need to rally to
be with your animal

00:47:15.200 --> 00:47:19.640 align:middle line:84%
during that last moment at the
clinic, when your animal does

00:47:19.640 --> 00:47:21.070 align:middle line:90%
require euthanasia.

00:47:21.070 --> 00:47:22.390 align:middle line:90%
Be there, holding your pet.

00:47:22.390 --> 00:47:25.360 align:middle line:84%
And if you cannot,
there are others

00:47:25.360 --> 00:47:27.160 align:middle line:90%
who might be able to step in.

00:47:27.160 --> 00:47:30.890 align:middle line:84%
Before we get to that part,
which I think is really--

00:47:30.890 --> 00:47:33.930 align:middle line:84%
you have another amazing
story about that.

00:47:33.930 --> 00:47:36.530 align:middle line:84%
Is it a matter of when
they're in too much pain?

00:47:36.530 --> 00:47:38.450 align:middle line:84%
What is the determining
factor of when

00:47:38.450 --> 00:47:41.610 align:middle line:84%
you let it take its own course
versus when intervention

00:47:41.610 --> 00:47:43.640 align:middle line:90%
might be a good thing?

00:47:43.640 --> 00:47:45.355 align:middle line:84%
Well, as you just
mentioned, pain.

00:47:45.355 --> 00:47:47.059 align:middle line:84%
REGINA MEREDITH: Pain, yeah.
Excruciating pain.

00:47:47.059 --> 00:47:47.780 align:middle line:90%
Pain is huge.

00:47:47.780 --> 00:47:50.523 align:middle line:84%
And think of your
human loved ones.

00:47:50.523 --> 00:47:51.256 align:middle line:90%
REGINA MEREDITH: Yeah.

00:47:51.256 --> 00:47:52.590 align:middle line:90%
You know?

00:47:52.590 --> 00:47:55.740 align:middle line:84%
We don't want to see
our loved ones in pain.

00:47:55.740 --> 00:47:58.470 align:middle line:84%
And then when you have
communicated with animals that

00:47:58.470 --> 00:48:00.800 align:middle line:84%
are in extreme pain,
and that have been

00:48:00.800 --> 00:48:02.990 align:middle line:84%
brought in for
euthanasia, are they,

00:48:02.990 --> 00:48:05.410 align:middle line:90%
like-- are they open to this?

00:48:05.410 --> 00:48:06.700 align:middle line:84%
Absolutely.
REGINA MEREDITH: They are.

00:48:06.700 --> 00:48:08.120 align:middle line:84%
OK.
-I do believe they are.

00:48:08.120 --> 00:48:10.740 align:middle line:90%
I do believe they are.

00:48:10.740 --> 00:48:12.419 align:middle line:84%
Yes.
-OK.

00:48:12.419 --> 00:48:14.050 align:middle line:84%
You know, all beings
want to stay alive.

00:48:14.050 --> 00:48:16.470 align:middle line:90%
They want to thrive.

00:48:16.470 --> 00:48:18.670 align:middle line:90%
Animals in pain are quite ready.

00:48:18.670 --> 00:48:19.830 align:middle line:90%
As I believe are humans.

00:48:19.830 --> 00:48:20.530 align:middle line:90%
Are humans.

00:48:20.530 --> 00:48:22.079 align:middle line:84%
Humans are too.
LINDA BENDER: Yeah.

00:48:22.079 --> 00:48:24.125 align:middle line:84%
Now, you have a story
about a woman named Jean.

00:48:24.125 --> 00:48:27.180 align:middle line:84%
And this gets us back
to the euthanasia.

00:48:27.180 --> 00:48:29.660 align:middle line:84%
LINDA BENDER: Yes.
Right.

00:48:29.660 --> 00:48:31.950 align:middle line:84%
Again, I was giving
a talk one day.

00:48:31.950 --> 00:48:35.110 align:middle line:84%
And a woman came
up to me afterward.

00:48:35.110 --> 00:48:37.880 align:middle line:90%
And she was quite emotional.

00:48:37.880 --> 00:48:40.070 align:middle line:84%
And she said, I don't know
how you do what you do.

00:48:40.070 --> 00:48:41.320 align:middle line:90%
How do you do what you do?

00:48:41.320 --> 00:48:42.340 align:middle line:90%
I love animals.

00:48:42.340 --> 00:48:43.070 align:middle line:90%
I want to help.

00:48:43.070 --> 00:48:44.930 align:middle line:90%
It hurts too much.

00:48:44.930 --> 00:48:46.410 align:middle line:90%
I just lost my dog.

00:48:46.410 --> 00:48:52.840 align:middle line:84%
I could barely stand being
there during the euthanasia.

00:48:52.840 --> 00:48:54.590 align:middle line:84%
She said, I don't
know what I can do.

00:48:54.590 --> 00:48:56.470 align:middle line:90%
I just am breaking down.

00:48:56.470 --> 00:48:58.260 align:middle line:90%
So I told her a wonderful story.

00:48:58.260 --> 00:49:01.000 align:middle line:84%
I said, well, first of
all, why I do what I do.

00:49:01.000 --> 00:49:03.390 align:middle line:90%
I'll give you a quick story.

00:49:03.390 --> 00:49:08.340 align:middle line:84%
And I really wanted to cheer her
up, because I said, all right.

00:49:08.340 --> 00:49:11.120 align:middle line:84%
For the past five years,
I teach young people.

00:49:11.120 --> 00:49:12.530 align:middle line:90%
I teach high school students.

00:49:12.530 --> 00:49:15.240 align:middle line:84%
And I teach them
about the environment,

00:49:15.240 --> 00:49:17.220 align:middle line:90%
about all sorts of things.

00:49:17.220 --> 00:49:21.010 align:middle line:84%
And I work my magic into
animals and the environment.

00:49:21.010 --> 00:49:25.970 align:middle line:84%
So I was heading to a class
one morning, leaving my home,

00:49:25.970 --> 00:49:27.700 align:middle line:84%
and I had to stop
by the Apple Store

00:49:27.700 --> 00:49:30.500 align:middle line:84%
and pick up some equipment
to use for my talk,

00:49:30.500 --> 00:49:32.450 align:middle line:90%
so I was in a bit of a hurry.

00:49:32.450 --> 00:49:34.620 align:middle line:84%
Went down to the end of
my street, turned right.

00:49:34.620 --> 00:49:37.760 align:middle line:84%
And as I entered a
slightly bigger street,

00:49:37.760 --> 00:49:42.120 align:middle line:84%
I saw this lump of feathers
on the side of the road,

00:49:42.120 --> 00:49:45.780 align:middle line:84%
almost getting a little
too close to the road.

00:49:45.780 --> 00:49:49.990 align:middle line:84%
So of course, as I
usually do, or always do,

00:49:49.990 --> 00:49:53.140 align:middle line:84%
I stopped my car in
the middle of the road,

00:49:53.140 --> 00:49:57.050 align:middle line:84%
opened the door wide to
try to block the traffic.

00:49:57.050 --> 00:50:00.010 align:middle line:84%
And I dashed across
the road, and there,

00:50:00.010 --> 00:50:05.380 align:middle line:84%
in a hump on the road, was
this enormous turkey vulture.

00:50:05.380 --> 00:50:07.530 align:middle line:84%
Now, how often do we
see turkey vultures?

00:50:07.530 --> 00:50:10.430 align:middle line:84%
They're a large
lump of feathers.

00:50:10.430 --> 00:50:12.930 align:middle line:90%
Obviously in distress.

00:50:12.930 --> 00:50:17.640 align:middle line:84%
Was about to get onto the road,
and unfortunately, be hit.

00:50:17.640 --> 00:50:18.760 align:middle line:90%
So I dashed over.

00:50:18.760 --> 00:50:20.050 align:middle line:90%
Thought, what am I going to do?

00:50:20.050 --> 00:50:23.320 align:middle line:84%
Reached down, grabbed
this enormous turkey

00:50:23.320 --> 00:50:24.270 align:middle line:90%
vulture in my arms.

00:50:24.270 --> 00:50:25.220 align:middle line:90%
It was a female.

00:50:25.220 --> 00:50:26.930 align:middle line:90%
You could tell by the markings.

00:50:26.930 --> 00:50:28.860 align:middle line:90%
And she let me pick her up.

00:50:28.860 --> 00:50:30.259 align:middle line:84%
So I thought, OK.
Great.

00:50:30.259 --> 00:50:31.300 align:middle line:90%
What are we going to do now?

00:50:31.300 --> 00:50:35.140 align:middle line:84%
So I marched over to
my car, managed to open

00:50:35.140 --> 00:50:39.030 align:middle line:90%
the car door with my foot.

00:50:39.030 --> 00:50:43.155 align:middle line:84%
Turkey vulture and I got
in my Prius, shut the door,

00:50:43.155 --> 00:50:44.550 align:middle line:84%
thought, what are
we going to do?

00:50:44.550 --> 00:50:46.590 align:middle line:90%
I put her in the passenger seat.

00:50:46.590 --> 00:50:48.390 align:middle line:84%
We dashed over to
the Apple Store.

00:50:48.390 --> 00:50:50.390 align:middle line:90%
I parked and I said, don't move.

00:50:50.390 --> 00:50:51.160 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHTER]

00:50:51.160 --> 00:50:53.510 align:middle line:90%
Like she could fly away, right?

00:50:53.510 --> 00:50:54.930 align:middle line:90%
She was listening.

00:50:54.930 --> 00:50:58.970 align:middle line:84%
I went into the Apple Store,
got my buddies to help me.

00:50:58.970 --> 00:51:01.460 align:middle line:84%
And I said, I gotta go.
I've gotta go.

00:51:01.460 --> 00:51:04.570 align:middle line:84%
I've got this enormous
bird in my car, tada tada.

00:51:04.570 --> 00:51:05.930 align:middle line:90%
So he said, I'll help you out.

00:51:05.930 --> 00:51:07.990 align:middle line:84%
We dashed out to
the parking lot.

00:51:07.990 --> 00:51:11.160 align:middle line:84%
I turned around, and not only
was my one Apple employee

00:51:11.160 --> 00:51:13.680 align:middle line:84%
friend there, but there was
a string of about 20 others

00:51:13.680 --> 00:51:15.700 align:middle line:90%
all wanting to see.

00:51:15.700 --> 00:51:16.530 align:middle line:90%
Got in the car.

00:51:16.530 --> 00:51:19.200 align:middle line:90%
There was my turkey vulture.

00:51:19.200 --> 00:51:22.510 align:middle line:84%
What I did was drive
her over to a friend's

00:51:22.510 --> 00:51:25.590 align:middle line:90%
rescue and rehab facility.

00:51:25.590 --> 00:51:27.030 align:middle line:90%
She was there, luckily.

00:51:27.030 --> 00:51:29.660 align:middle line:84%
We put the vulture in
the cage, because there

00:51:29.660 --> 00:51:32.410 align:middle line:84%
was no immediate
sign of acute trauma.

00:51:32.410 --> 00:51:34.490 align:middle line:90%
I said, let's leave her here.

00:51:34.490 --> 00:51:37.140 align:middle line:90%
I'll be back later tonight.

00:51:37.140 --> 00:51:38.450 align:middle line:90%
So I went up on my day.

00:51:38.450 --> 00:51:41.460 align:middle line:84%
She called me and
said, I think we're OK.

00:51:41.460 --> 00:51:42.160 align:middle line:90%
OK, I said.

00:51:42.160 --> 00:51:43.860 align:middle line:90%
I can't get over till 9 o'clock.

00:51:43.860 --> 00:51:45.390 align:middle line:84%
I said, can we wait
till the morning?

00:51:45.390 --> 00:51:47.070 align:middle line:90%
She said, I think we can.

00:51:47.070 --> 00:51:50.390 align:middle line:84%
First thing the next morning,
she rang me and said, Linda,

00:51:50.390 --> 00:51:52.660 align:middle line:84%
get over here as
fast as you can.

00:51:52.660 --> 00:51:55.160 align:middle line:84%
We have got to let this bird
go because if not, she's

00:51:55.160 --> 00:51:56.735 align:middle line:90%
going to break my cage.

00:51:56.735 --> 00:51:58.720 align:middle line:90%
I dashed over there.

00:51:58.720 --> 00:52:00.970 align:middle line:90%
There she was.

00:52:00.970 --> 00:52:02.810 align:middle line:90%
Whatever was wrong was--

00:52:02.810 --> 00:52:03.891 align:middle line:84%
Right.
---no longer wrong.

00:52:03.891 --> 00:52:06.010 align:middle line:84%
-Was right.
-Was right.

00:52:06.010 --> 00:52:08.160 align:middle line:90%
And she was fierce.

00:52:08.160 --> 00:52:13.050 align:middle line:84%
So I went over and I opened
this enormous wire door.

00:52:13.050 --> 00:52:16.720 align:middle line:84%
And she stepped
out so gracefully.

00:52:16.720 --> 00:52:20.875 align:middle line:84%
And she righted her body
and looked at me straight

00:52:20.875 --> 00:52:24.300 align:middle line:90%
in the eyes, and a thank you.

00:52:24.300 --> 00:52:28.590 align:middle line:84%
And then she turned and
flew up into the trees.

00:52:28.590 --> 00:52:31.567 align:middle line:84%
Now, I don't know if you've ever
seen a turkey vulture wingspan.

00:52:31.567 --> 00:52:32.700 align:middle line:84%
REGINA MEREDITH:
In California, we

00:52:32.700 --> 00:52:34.260 align:middle line:90%
have them all around our house.

00:52:34.260 --> 00:52:35.240 align:middle line:90%
I see them all the time.

00:52:35.240 --> 00:52:37.090 align:middle line:90%
LINDA BENDER: 7 foot huge.

00:52:37.090 --> 00:52:38.660 align:middle line:84%
It took my breath away--
-Yes.

00:52:38.660 --> 00:52:42.700 align:middle line:84%
---as I watched her
fly up into the trees,

00:52:42.700 --> 00:52:44.720 align:middle line:90%
having a second chance at life.

00:52:44.720 --> 00:52:46.010 align:middle line:90%
That's why I do what I do.

00:52:46.010 --> 00:52:47.476 align:middle line:84%
Second chance at life.
LINDA BENDER: Yes.

00:52:47.476 --> 00:52:48.411 align:middle line:90%
Now Jean--

00:52:48.411 --> 00:52:49.410 align:middle line:90%
LINDA BENDER: So I told Jean--

00:52:49.410 --> 00:52:50.280 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:52:50.280 --> 00:52:52.280 align:middle line:90%
Jean listened to the story.

00:52:52.280 --> 00:52:54.981 align:middle line:84%
And I said, you know, there
are a lot of things you can do,

00:52:54.981 --> 00:52:57.240 align:middle line:84%
Jean.
I know you love dogs.

00:52:57.240 --> 00:53:00.590 align:middle line:84%
I know you want to honor
the dog you just lost.

00:53:00.590 --> 00:53:02.880 align:middle line:84%
Why don't you call
a few vet clinics,

00:53:02.880 --> 00:53:05.360 align:middle line:84%
see what you can
do to volunteer.

00:53:05.360 --> 00:53:08.280 align:middle line:84%
About two months later, I
got a phone call from Jean.

00:53:08.280 --> 00:53:09.430 align:middle line:90%
She was ecstatic.

00:53:09.430 --> 00:53:11.760 align:middle line:84%
She said, Linda, I
couldn't wait to tell you.

00:53:11.760 --> 00:53:16.010 align:middle line:84%
I am now on call volunteering
when people cannot

00:53:16.010 --> 00:53:19.390 align:middle line:84%
face holding their
animals when they're about

00:53:19.390 --> 00:53:20.840 align:middle line:84%
to be put to sleep.
I go.

00:53:20.840 --> 00:53:22.800 align:middle line:90%
I comfort that animal.

00:53:22.800 --> 00:53:24.160 align:middle line:90%
That is just so beautiful.

00:53:24.160 --> 00:53:24.950 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:53:24.950 --> 00:53:29.530 align:middle line:84%
And that is her mission,
and that's her [INAUDIBLE].

00:53:29.530 --> 00:53:30.610 align:middle line:90%
And any of us can do that?

00:53:30.610 --> 00:53:31.580 align:middle line:90%
Any of us can do that.

00:53:31.580 --> 00:53:34.070 align:middle line:84%
To hold that energy
for a little animal

00:53:34.070 --> 00:53:35.511 align:middle line:84%
so they don't go
out on their own.

00:53:35.511 --> 00:53:37.890 align:middle line:84%
-Right.
-Oh, I just love that.

00:53:37.890 --> 00:53:40.381 align:middle line:84%
And every time she does
it, it honors her dog.

00:53:40.381 --> 00:53:41.845 align:middle line:84%
-Yes.
-Yeah.

00:53:41.845 --> 00:53:43.240 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:53:43.240 --> 00:53:45.200 align:middle line:84%
I was just thinking
of something

00:53:45.200 --> 00:53:46.820 align:middle line:84%
when you were talking
about that turkey

00:53:46.820 --> 00:53:48.760 align:middle line:90%
vulture part of the story.

00:53:48.760 --> 00:53:50.860 align:middle line:84%
And one day, I was
contemplating something.

00:53:50.860 --> 00:53:52.760 align:middle line:84%
It was a deeper
question, and I was

00:53:52.760 --> 00:53:55.180 align:middle line:84%
really looking for an
answer and didn't have it.

00:53:55.180 --> 00:53:58.280 align:middle line:84%
I was looking for a sign about
something, whether to take

00:53:58.280 --> 00:53:59.250 align:middle line:90%
action on something.

00:53:59.250 --> 00:53:59.950 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

00:53:59.950 --> 00:54:02.760 align:middle line:10%
And as I was driving
down our lane,

00:54:02.760 --> 00:54:06.570 align:middle line:10%
this turkey vulture came
out and flew-- I mean,

00:54:06.570 --> 00:54:08.175 align:middle line:10%
it felt like it was 3
feet from the window.

00:54:08.175 --> 00:54:09.250 align:middle line:90%
It might have been 6 feet.

00:54:09.250 --> 00:54:10.410 align:middle line:90%
It was very close.

00:54:10.410 --> 00:54:11.220 align:middle line:90%
LINDA BENDER: Yes.

00:54:11.220 --> 00:54:13.990 align:middle line:84%
And he had picked up a
snake, which was dangling

00:54:13.990 --> 00:54:17.700 align:middle line:84%
in his mouth, and flew right
in front of my windshield

00:54:17.700 --> 00:54:18.610 align:middle line:90%
with this snake.

00:54:18.610 --> 00:54:19.450 align:middle line:90%
Oh my.

00:54:19.450 --> 00:54:21.050 align:middle line:84%
And because of the
nature of the question,

00:54:21.050 --> 00:54:22.930 align:middle line:90%
I knew exactly what that meant.

00:54:22.930 --> 00:54:26.700 align:middle line:84%
And so the thing-- I mean, that
was just an amazing experience.

00:54:26.700 --> 00:54:28.581 align:middle line:84%
But that brings us to
the psychic part of it.

00:54:28.581 --> 00:54:29.280 align:middle line:90%
Right.

00:54:29.280 --> 00:54:30.800 align:middle line:84%
We only have a
few minutes left.

00:54:30.800 --> 00:54:31.499 align:middle line:90%
Right.

00:54:31.499 --> 00:54:33.550 align:middle line:84%
Now, some of us have learned
how to develop connections

00:54:33.550 --> 00:54:36.910 align:middle line:84%
with spirit guides, whatever
you want to call it,

00:54:36.910 --> 00:54:38.941 align:middle line:84%
all these different
forces around us.

00:54:38.941 --> 00:54:39.640 align:middle line:90%
LINDA BENDER: Yes.

00:54:39.640 --> 00:54:41.470 align:middle line:84%
And we learned how
to open and listen.

00:54:41.470 --> 00:54:43.990 align:middle line:84%
Is it basically the
same process if we

00:54:43.990 --> 00:54:45.200 align:middle line:90%
want to connect with our pets?

00:54:45.200 --> 00:54:47.140 align:middle line:90%
Same intention, same process?

00:54:47.140 --> 00:54:48.200 align:middle line:90%
It totally is.

00:54:48.200 --> 00:54:50.860 align:middle line:10%
And I always say to people,
I've been a meditator

00:54:50.860 --> 00:54:52.760 align:middle line:10%
for many, many, many years.
REGINA MEREDITH: Yes.

00:54:52.760 --> 00:54:55.270 align:middle line:10%
If there's one thing you want
to do to make your life better,

00:54:55.270 --> 00:55:00.990 align:middle line:10%
to tune into not only yourself,
but all life around you,

00:55:00.990 --> 00:55:02.570 align:middle line:10%
it's meditation.
REGINA MEREDITH: Yes.

00:55:02.570 --> 00:55:06.820 align:middle line:84%
And with animals, whether they
be wild animals or companion

00:55:06.820 --> 00:55:10.860 align:middle line:84%
animals, it's so much about
listening and opening,

00:55:10.860 --> 00:55:13.680 align:middle line:84%
and again, seeing
that invitation

00:55:13.680 --> 00:55:17.280 align:middle line:84%
that is always there for those
who are willing to respond.

00:55:17.280 --> 00:55:19.070 align:middle line:84%
The other thing I
find with animals

00:55:19.070 --> 00:55:21.360 align:middle line:90%
and messages, two things.

00:55:21.360 --> 00:55:25.620 align:middle line:84%
One is people cling
to an animal totem.

00:55:25.620 --> 00:55:28.220 align:middle line:84%
I believe that all
animals are totems.

00:55:28.220 --> 00:55:30.610 align:middle line:84%
And so don't
disregard if an animal

00:55:30.610 --> 00:55:35.180 align:middle line:84%
that you don't know
familiarly as a totem

00:55:35.180 --> 00:55:37.220 align:middle line:90%
comes to you in some way.

00:55:37.220 --> 00:55:38.030 align:middle line:90%
Listen.

00:55:38.030 --> 00:55:40.660 align:middle line:84%
Always be willing
to listen to what

00:55:40.660 --> 00:55:43.860 align:middle line:90%
any animal is bringing to us.

00:55:43.860 --> 00:55:45.760 align:middle line:84%
And I believe that
it isn't necessarily

00:55:45.760 --> 00:55:47.890 align:middle line:84%
the animal specifically
who was doing that.

00:55:47.890 --> 00:55:51.660 align:middle line:84%
I believe it is the
workings of the universe--

00:55:51.660 --> 00:55:56.280 align:middle line:84%
even other humans on the
other side using animals.

00:55:56.280 --> 00:55:59.720 align:middle line:84%
An animal may be doing
something, crossing your path,

00:55:59.720 --> 00:56:04.430 align:middle line:84%
not even necessarily
aware, but its presence is

00:56:04.430 --> 00:56:07.470 align:middle line:84%
guided there by higher forces.
-Yes.

00:56:07.470 --> 00:56:08.680 align:middle line:90%
I couldn't agree more.

00:56:08.680 --> 00:56:10.280 align:middle line:84%
Thank you so much for that.
-Yes.

00:56:10.280 --> 00:56:12.280 align:middle line:84%
And meanwhile, we have just
a couple minutes left now,

00:56:12.280 --> 00:56:13.900 align:middle line:84%
I want to find out
about the project.

00:56:13.900 --> 00:56:17.160 align:middle line:84%
I mean, Rupert Sheldrake
has come to-- is

00:56:17.160 --> 00:56:18.490 align:middle line:90%
in support of your work.

00:56:18.490 --> 00:56:19.700 align:middle line:84%
And you're writing
this new book.

00:56:19.700 --> 00:56:21.160 align:middle line:84%
He's actually putting
an endorsement,

00:56:21.160 --> 00:56:22.010 align:middle line:90%
which is unheard of.

00:56:22.010 --> 00:56:23.740 align:middle line:90%
Rupert doesn't endorse.

00:56:23.740 --> 00:56:25.270 align:middle line:84%
But it just shows the
power of your work.

00:56:25.270 --> 00:56:25.970 align:middle line:90%
Thank you.

00:56:25.970 --> 00:56:28.500 align:middle line:84%
And he's done that beautiful
work with animals himself.

00:56:28.500 --> 00:56:29.200 align:middle line:90%
LINDA BENDER: Yes.

00:56:29.200 --> 00:56:31.490 align:middle line:84%
So now you have a new effort,
and you would like people

00:56:31.490 --> 00:56:33.340 align:middle line:90%
to send their stories into you.

00:56:33.340 --> 00:56:34.930 align:middle line:84%
Can you speak about it
just for a minute or so?

00:56:34.930 --> 00:56:35.630 align:middle line:90%
Yes, sure.

00:56:35.630 --> 00:56:38.961 align:middle line:84%
Rupert Sheldrake is definitely
one of my all-time heroes.

00:56:38.961 --> 00:56:39.660 align:middle line:90%
REGINA MEREDITH: Yes.

00:56:39.660 --> 00:56:42.410 align:middle line:84%
He has done an amazing
amount of research

00:56:42.410 --> 00:56:46.430 align:middle line:84%
on dogs, cats,
animals, and their,

00:56:46.430 --> 00:56:50.590 align:middle line:90%
quote, "unexplained behaviors."

00:56:50.590 --> 00:56:54.010 align:middle line:84%
What I have put together,
and he has helped me with,

00:56:54.010 --> 00:56:57.780 align:middle line:84%
is a venture to
create a database.

00:56:57.780 --> 00:57:01.780 align:middle line:84%
So I would like everyone who
has a wonderful companion animal

00:57:01.780 --> 00:57:05.180 align:middle line:84%
story or any-- even a wildlife,
but particularly dogs and cats,

00:57:05.180 --> 00:57:11.660 align:middle line:84%
to email me stories about
unexplained powers of animals.

00:57:11.660 --> 00:57:12.941 align:middle line:84%
Little psychic
connections and--

00:57:12.941 --> 00:57:14.200 align:middle line:84%
LINDA BENDER: Yes.
-Yes.

00:57:14.200 --> 00:57:14.900 align:middle line:84%
LINDA BENDER: Yes.
-Wonderful.

00:57:14.900 --> 00:57:16.910 align:middle line:84%
All those things
because I know very

00:57:16.910 --> 00:57:18.620 align:middle line:90%
few people who don't have them.

00:57:18.620 --> 00:57:19.390 align:middle line:90%
REGINA MEREDITH: Yes.

00:57:19.390 --> 00:57:22.490 align:middle line:84%
And really powerful ones,
we're going to put together.

00:57:22.490 --> 00:57:24.430 align:middle line:84%
We're going to
document all this.

00:57:24.430 --> 00:57:27.070 align:middle line:84%
And I am hoping to, at
a later date, pool this,

00:57:27.070 --> 00:57:30.890 align:middle line:84%
and some of this will be
put out to be published.

00:57:30.890 --> 00:57:31.950 align:middle line:90%
So it's very exciting.

00:57:31.950 --> 00:57:33.840 align:middle line:90%
So if you can all email me--

00:57:33.840 --> 00:57:34.994 align:middle line:84%
Yes, and I'll
give them the URL--

00:57:34.994 --> 00:57:36.559 align:middle line:84%
---your wonderful stories.
---in just a second.

00:57:36.559 --> 00:57:38.120 align:middle line:90%
And thank you so much.

00:57:38.120 --> 00:57:39.760 align:middle line:84%
I'm so sorry we're out
of time, because we

00:57:39.760 --> 00:57:40.820 align:middle line:90%
could talk for another hour.

00:57:40.820 --> 00:57:41.530 align:middle line:90%
I could keep going.

00:57:41.530 --> 00:57:42.640 align:middle line:90%
I love hearing these stories.

00:57:42.640 --> 00:57:44.771 align:middle line:84%
Thank you so much, Linda, for
the incredibly beautiful work

00:57:44.771 --> 00:57:46.720 align:middle line:84%
you do.
-I'm privileged to be here.

00:57:46.720 --> 00:57:47.970 align:middle line:90%
Thank you.

00:57:47.970 --> 00:57:49.570 align:middle line:10%
To connect with
Linda's work, and ways

00:57:49.570 --> 00:57:51.260 align:middle line:10%
to become involved with
the animal kingdom,

00:57:51.260 --> 00:57:52.890 align:middle line:10%
you can go to lindabender.org.

00:57:52.890 --> 00:57:55.640 align:middle line:10%
