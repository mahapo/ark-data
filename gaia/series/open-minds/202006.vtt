00:00:19.068 --> 00:00:20.610 align:middle line:10%
>>REGINA MEREDITH:
What first drew me

00:00:20.610 --> 00:00:22.410 align:middle line:10%
to Carl Calleman's
latest work is

00:00:22.410 --> 00:00:24.960 align:middle line:10%
that it mentioned we're in a
phase of consciousness that

00:00:24.960 --> 00:00:27.250 align:middle line:10%
leads to conspiratorial
thinking.

00:00:27.250 --> 00:00:30.630 align:middle line:84%
We see the ramifications of this
in the divided world around us.

00:00:30.630 --> 00:00:33.780 align:middle line:84%
But what if there's a much
higher potential to tap into?

00:00:33.780 --> 00:00:36.050 align:middle line:84%
This is what Carl and I
will be discussing today.

00:00:36.050 --> 00:00:36.850 align:middle line:90%
Welcome, Carl.

00:00:36.850 --> 00:00:38.310 align:middle line:84%
It's good to have
you in the studio.

00:00:38.310 --> 00:00:39.140 align:middle line:84%
>>CARL JOHAN CALLEMAN:
Thank you so much

00:00:39.140 --> 00:00:41.010 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: I've only met
you via Zoom before.

00:00:41.010 --> 00:00:41.810 align:middle line:90%
>>CARL: Yeah.

00:00:41.810 --> 00:00:42.610 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:00:42.610 --> 00:00:43.530 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:00:43.530 --> 00:00:45.072 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: I want to
set this straight

00:00:45.072 --> 00:00:47.610 align:middle line:84%
before people start
wasting their energy trying

00:00:47.610 --> 00:00:49.440 align:middle line:90%
to guess what your accent is.

00:00:49.440 --> 00:00:51.810 align:middle line:84%
I want to talk a little bit
about your background, both

00:00:51.810 --> 00:00:54.930 align:middle line:84%
where you come from,
but also professionally

00:00:54.930 --> 00:00:57.860 align:middle line:84%
what you were trained to be
and how you spent your time.

00:00:57.860 --> 00:00:58.660 align:middle line:90%
>>CARL: Yeah.

00:00:58.660 --> 00:00:59.550 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:00:59.550 --> 00:01:01.020 align:middle line:90%
So I come from Sweden.

00:01:01.020 --> 00:01:03.330 align:middle line:84%
That's where I was
raised and grew up.

00:01:03.330 --> 00:01:08.610 align:middle line:10%
I got a doctorate in physical
biology from one of the--

00:01:08.610 --> 00:01:12.060 align:middle line:10%
my mentor was a member of the
Nobel committee in Sweden.

00:01:12.060 --> 00:01:16.620 align:middle line:84%
And so I worked in
the hard sciences--

00:01:16.620 --> 00:01:22.740 align:middle line:84%
toxicology-- 10 years in
Sweden, and then 10 years at

00:01:22.740 --> 00:01:25.500 align:middle line:84%
the University of
Washington in Seattle,

00:01:25.500 --> 00:01:28.230 align:middle line:84%
the Department of
Environmental Health.

00:01:28.230 --> 00:01:32.130 align:middle line:90%
And then came a sudden--

00:01:32.130 --> 00:01:37.050 align:middle line:84%
everything was up in the air
with grants and whatever.

00:01:37.050 --> 00:01:40.620 align:middle line:84%
And I had already
become acquainted

00:01:40.620 --> 00:01:44.100 align:middle line:84%
with the Mayan calendar,
and spent a lot of time

00:01:44.100 --> 00:01:46.390 align:middle line:90%
down in Mexico and so forth.

00:01:46.390 --> 00:01:50.400 align:middle line:84%
And then I just
couldn't help myself

00:01:50.400 --> 00:01:54.050 align:middle line:84%
from changing the
direction of my work.

00:01:54.050 --> 00:01:59.400 align:middle line:84%
And I full time started to
study the Mayan calendar,

00:01:59.400 --> 00:02:03.640 align:middle line:84%
and especially what it could
mean for modern people.

00:02:03.640 --> 00:02:08.044 align:middle line:84%
You cannot make sense of it from
a modern scientific background.

00:02:08.044 --> 00:02:08.919 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Definitely.

00:02:08.919 --> 00:02:11.410 align:middle line:84%
And what's interesting is
that you had that curiosity

00:02:11.410 --> 00:02:12.210 align:middle line:90%
to begin with.

00:02:12.210 --> 00:02:15.210 align:middle line:84%
Now, we're all very
textured beings

00:02:15.210 --> 00:02:17.040 align:middle line:84%
in terms of our
interests and what

00:02:17.040 --> 00:02:20.280 align:middle line:84%
we're drawn to that can come
from across time and space.

00:02:20.280 --> 00:02:24.360 align:middle line:84%
What drew you to the Mayan
calendar at the inception?

00:02:24.360 --> 00:02:26.730 align:middle line:84%
>>CARL: I had been
there when I was 29.

00:02:26.730 --> 00:02:31.410 align:middle line:84%
I did a backpacking tour
to Mexico and Guatemala.

00:02:31.410 --> 00:02:34.680 align:middle line:84%
And sort of just feeling
I should go there.

00:02:34.680 --> 00:02:37.250 align:middle line:90%


00:02:37.250 --> 00:02:42.460 align:middle line:84%
And then when I came
there, I just felt at home.

00:02:42.460 --> 00:02:46.740 align:middle line:84%
Mexico especially felt
like my spiritual home.

00:02:46.740 --> 00:02:50.940 align:middle line:84%
And then I would get some
contact with the Maya

00:02:50.940 --> 00:02:53.710 align:middle line:84%
down in the Yucatan
and so forth.

00:02:53.710 --> 00:02:57.370 align:middle line:84%
And there was
something about them,

00:02:57.370 --> 00:03:00.420 align:middle line:84%
I think, seeing something
in me that I had not

00:03:00.420 --> 00:03:01.410 align:middle line:90%
thought of before.

00:03:01.410 --> 00:03:03.660 align:middle line:84%
I was still working
in laboratories

00:03:03.660 --> 00:03:04.620 align:middle line:90%
as a graduate student.

00:03:04.620 --> 00:03:06.520 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And what were
they reflecting back to you?

00:03:06.520 --> 00:03:07.603 align:middle line:90%
>>CARL: Well, not really--

00:03:07.603 --> 00:03:11.600 align:middle line:84%
I mean, somebody would just
come up with some little amulet

00:03:11.600 --> 00:03:14.070 align:middle line:84%
or something like that and
say, [NON-ENGLISH SPEECH]..

00:03:14.070 --> 00:03:15.240 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: It's for you.

00:03:15.240 --> 00:03:16.620 align:middle line:90%
>>CARL: For you.

00:03:16.620 --> 00:03:20.000 align:middle line:90%
And why for me?

00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:21.590 align:middle line:90%
Why for me?

00:03:21.590 --> 00:03:24.830 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Because
in Scandinavia,

00:03:24.830 --> 00:03:29.610 align:middle line:84%
the society and culture is
a little more withdrawn.

00:03:29.610 --> 00:03:32.650 align:middle line:84%
A little more austere in
terms of emotional expression,

00:03:32.650 --> 00:03:33.450 align:middle line:90%
casually.

00:03:33.450 --> 00:03:33.810 align:middle line:90%
Right?

00:03:33.810 --> 00:03:34.410 align:middle line:90%
>>CARL: Yeah, yeah.

00:03:34.410 --> 00:03:34.620 align:middle line:90%
Sure.

00:03:34.620 --> 00:03:35.040 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:03:35.040 --> 00:03:35.840 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:03:35.840 --> 00:03:37.600 align:middle line:84%
So this would be a
question for you.

00:03:37.600 --> 00:03:40.050 align:middle line:90%
>>CARL: Yeah, that's right.

00:03:40.050 --> 00:03:46.070 align:middle line:84%
And so after that I just knew
this is the purpose of my life.

00:03:46.070 --> 00:03:48.240 align:middle line:84%
But then it took
another 13 years

00:03:48.240 --> 00:03:50.910 align:middle line:84%
until I devoted
myself full time to it

00:03:50.910 --> 00:03:54.060 align:middle line:90%
and left the previous career.

00:03:54.060 --> 00:03:55.890 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Yes, and
I'm glad you did.

00:03:55.890 --> 00:03:57.330 align:middle line:84%
You'd probably be
so bored by now

00:03:57.330 --> 00:03:59.205 align:middle line:84%
and you'd be kicking
yourself that you hadn't

00:03:59.205 --> 00:04:00.580 align:middle line:90%
left that career for this.

00:04:00.580 --> 00:04:01.380 align:middle line:90%
>>CARL: Probably.

00:04:01.380 --> 00:04:03.660 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So we spoke
in a conversation

00:04:03.660 --> 00:04:05.550 align:middle line:84%
on ReginaMeredith.com,
on my own site,

00:04:05.550 --> 00:04:07.860 align:middle line:84%
and we had the first
part of a conversation

00:04:07.860 --> 00:04:09.960 align:middle line:84%
about the ninth wave
of consciousness.

00:04:09.960 --> 00:04:11.700 align:middle line:84%
And what I want to
do is flesh this out

00:04:11.700 --> 00:04:15.730 align:middle line:84%
in this big fat conversation
today and go further than that.

00:04:15.730 --> 00:04:19.470 align:middle line:84%
But I want to dip back into
the whole notion of the Plumed

00:04:19.470 --> 00:04:22.350 align:middle line:84%
Serpent and the waves
of consciousness,

00:04:22.350 --> 00:04:25.800 align:middle line:84%
and how this shows up in our
world throughout history.

00:04:25.800 --> 00:04:28.722 align:middle line:84%
So give a nice explanation
as background to everyone.

00:04:28.722 --> 00:04:30.180 align:middle line:84%
>>CARL: I should
say, first of all,

00:04:30.180 --> 00:04:34.740 align:middle line:84%
that I base myself on
the ancient Maya, what

00:04:34.740 --> 00:04:38.140 align:middle line:84%
I have developed as
kind of a cosmology.

00:04:38.140 --> 00:04:42.060 align:middle line:84%
And one of the most
prominent things

00:04:42.060 --> 00:04:45.450 align:middle line:84%
there-- and I remember
when I came to Chichen Itza

00:04:45.450 --> 00:04:48.720 align:middle line:84%
the first time, I couldn't
really make sense of it

00:04:48.720 --> 00:04:52.500 align:middle line:84%
with my, at that time,
quite rational mind.

00:04:52.500 --> 00:04:56.010 align:middle line:84%
Why do they build this
whole city, and especially

00:04:56.010 --> 00:05:02.230 align:middle line:84%
their main pyramid, in honor
of the serpent or a snake?

00:05:02.230 --> 00:05:06.240 align:middle line:10%
But then it turns out
all the major sites,

00:05:06.240 --> 00:05:11.250 align:middle line:10%
really, in Mexico are dedicated
to the Plumed Serpent.

00:05:11.250 --> 00:05:16.460 align:middle line:10%
So there must have been
something profound about it.

00:05:16.460 --> 00:05:19.960 align:middle line:10%
And the way I look upon it
and have come to explain

00:05:19.960 --> 00:05:23.160 align:middle line:10%
is it really is a
metaphor, a symbol,

00:05:23.160 --> 00:05:26.230 align:middle line:10%
that people in ancient
times would use in order

00:05:26.230 --> 00:05:30.530 align:middle line:10%
to describe a sine wave.

00:05:30.530 --> 00:05:32.440 align:middle line:84%
And when you start
thinking about it,

00:05:32.440 --> 00:05:35.920 align:middle line:84%
if you're living in
nature, basically you

00:05:35.920 --> 00:05:38.990 align:middle line:84%
don't have any computer
programs or anything like that.

00:05:38.990 --> 00:05:40.810 align:middle line:84%
And then you would
like to create

00:05:40.810 --> 00:05:44.320 align:middle line:84%
a metaphor for a sine
wave, well the best thing

00:05:44.320 --> 00:05:46.330 align:middle line:84%
you could come up
with is a serpent.

00:05:46.330 --> 00:05:47.170 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Yeah,
that makes sense,

00:05:47.170 --> 00:05:48.470 align:middle line:84%
because they were
always looking--

00:05:48.470 --> 00:05:48.850 align:middle line:90%
always.

00:05:48.850 --> 00:05:50.475 align:middle line:84%
I mean, the most
sophisticated cultures

00:05:50.475 --> 00:05:53.210 align:middle line:84%
still look to the natural
world for symbols.

00:05:53.210 --> 00:05:54.010 align:middle line:90%
>>CARL: Yeah.

00:05:54.010 --> 00:05:54.450 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right?

00:05:54.450 --> 00:05:55.250 align:middle line:90%
>>CARL: Yeah.

00:05:55.250 --> 00:05:58.240 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So what other
animal would indicate this?

00:05:58.240 --> 00:06:00.260 align:middle line:84%
Or even a tree or plant
would indicate that?

00:06:00.260 --> 00:06:01.060 align:middle line:90%
>>CARL: Yeah.

00:06:01.060 --> 00:06:01.860 align:middle line:90%
Right.

00:06:01.860 --> 00:06:06.100 align:middle line:84%
And it's also all with the
serpent, this Plumed Serpent,

00:06:06.100 --> 00:06:08.620 align:middle line:84%
which is like the
main creator god.

00:06:08.620 --> 00:06:12.400 align:middle line:84%
It used to be, in ancient
times, usually also linked

00:06:12.400 --> 00:06:14.240 align:middle line:90%
to the Tree of Life.

00:06:14.240 --> 00:06:16.600 align:middle line:84%
So you know, we have
the two main symbols

00:06:16.600 --> 00:06:19.470 align:middle line:90%
from the book of Genesis there.

00:06:19.470 --> 00:06:22.123 align:middle line:90%
But all cultures, many cultures.

00:06:22.123 --> 00:06:24.040 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Yes, because
you have this symbolism

00:06:24.040 --> 00:06:25.690 align:middle line:90%
of shedding skin.

00:06:25.690 --> 00:06:28.040 align:middle line:84%
So you annually have
a chance to renew.

00:06:28.040 --> 00:06:28.840 align:middle line:90%
>>CARL: You renew.

00:06:28.840 --> 00:06:29.380 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:06:29.380 --> 00:06:30.280 align:middle line:90%
>>CARL: Molting the skin.

00:06:30.280 --> 00:06:31.090 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Molting the skin.

00:06:31.090 --> 00:06:31.890 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

00:06:31.890 --> 00:06:34.023 align:middle line:84%
So it has a lot
of deep symbolism,

00:06:34.023 --> 00:06:35.440 align:middle line:84%
because a lot of
people have taken

00:06:35.440 --> 00:06:38.853 align:middle line:84%
it to mean black magic and
dark things in general.

00:06:38.853 --> 00:06:40.270 align:middle line:84%
And that's not
really what it was.

00:06:40.270 --> 00:06:42.410 align:middle line:84%
That's not how it
was used in Egypt.

00:06:42.410 --> 00:06:45.230 align:middle line:84%
It's not how it's been used
in Central and South America.

00:06:45.230 --> 00:06:48.100 align:middle line:84%
So I'm glad you're setting
the record straight on this.

00:06:48.100 --> 00:06:48.920 align:middle line:90%
>>CARL: Yeah.

00:06:48.920 --> 00:06:54.430 align:middle line:84%
And so the Plumed Serpent,
then, as I see it, is a wave--

00:06:54.430 --> 00:06:57.760 align:middle line:90%
or a number of waves, actually.

00:06:57.760 --> 00:07:02.260 align:middle line:84%
Specifically nine
major waves that

00:07:02.260 --> 00:07:05.530 align:middle line:84%
emanate from the
center of the universe.

00:07:05.530 --> 00:07:12.220 align:middle line:84%
And the ancient Mayan texts are
quite specific on that point.

00:07:12.220 --> 00:07:14.500 align:middle line:84%
They describe-- they say
there is something they

00:07:14.500 --> 00:07:17.920 align:middle line:90%
call the place of creation.

00:07:17.920 --> 00:07:24.002 align:middle line:84%
And they also talk about that
as the raised up sky place.

00:07:24.002 --> 00:07:25.960 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: I was going to
say, a lot of cultures

00:07:25.960 --> 00:07:28.030 align:middle line:90%
refer to it as the central sun.

00:07:28.030 --> 00:07:29.950 align:middle line:90%
>>CARL: They would.

00:07:29.950 --> 00:07:33.090 align:middle line:84%
BUT what it's a little bit
specific about the Maya

00:07:33.090 --> 00:07:35.650 align:middle line:84%
is that it sounds
like they describe it

00:07:35.650 --> 00:07:41.320 align:middle line:84%
as, in this center of the
universe there are slides,

00:07:41.320 --> 00:07:47.590 align:middle line:84%
raised up skies, that are
shifted with a specific rhythm,

00:07:47.590 --> 00:07:48.880 align:middle line:90%
so to speak.

00:07:48.880 --> 00:07:53.920 align:middle line:84%
And then there is a projection
throughout the universe

00:07:53.920 --> 00:07:58.280 align:middle line:90%
of a new state of consciousness.

00:07:58.280 --> 00:08:00.520 align:middle line:90%
And it all emanates from there.

00:08:00.520 --> 00:08:04.570 align:middle line:84%
But what carries the
information of this slide,

00:08:04.570 --> 00:08:09.130 align:middle line:84%
of this state or
geometry, that's

00:08:09.130 --> 00:08:11.680 align:middle line:90%
the wave, the Plumed Serpent.

00:08:11.680 --> 00:08:14.830 align:middle line:84%
So that's the one that
brings this to us.

00:08:14.830 --> 00:08:18.580 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And they specifically
say there are these nine waves.

00:08:18.580 --> 00:08:21.740 align:middle line:84%
So do these nine waves
repeat themselves?

00:08:21.740 --> 00:08:23.465 align:middle line:84%
Do you go through
a cycle of nine

00:08:23.465 --> 00:08:25.090 align:middle line:84%
and you're at a
certain level, and then

00:08:25.090 --> 00:08:27.790 align:middle line:90%
do you start again on the nine?

00:08:27.790 --> 00:08:28.960 align:middle line:90%
Or how does that work?

00:08:28.960 --> 00:08:31.150 align:middle line:84%
>>CARL: I think
it is a build up.

00:08:31.150 --> 00:08:32.170 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: A build up.

00:08:32.170 --> 00:08:32.970 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:08:32.970 --> 00:08:38.650 align:middle line:84%
>>CARL: Like the pyramids, they
would build these nine stories,

00:08:38.650 --> 00:08:40.750 align:middle line:90%
terraces so to speak.

00:08:40.750 --> 00:08:46.380 align:middle line:84%
And each one of these
represents a specific slide,

00:08:46.380 --> 00:08:50.530 align:middle line:84%
a specific geometric
information through which

00:08:50.530 --> 00:08:55.930 align:middle line:84%
the human beings will
perceive and create reality.

00:08:55.930 --> 00:08:59.890 align:middle line:90%
But it's a climb up nine levels.

00:08:59.890 --> 00:09:04.600 align:middle line:84%
And the fundamental thing that
happened, I would say in 2011,

00:09:04.600 --> 00:09:07.900 align:middle line:90%
is that the climb was completed.

00:09:07.900 --> 00:09:11.290 align:middle line:84%
For the first time in the
history of the universe,

00:09:11.290 --> 00:09:16.880 align:middle line:84%
all waves are in principle
accessible to us.

00:09:16.880 --> 00:09:17.680 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: OK.

00:09:17.680 --> 00:09:18.870 align:middle line:90%
That's exciting.

00:09:18.870 --> 00:09:20.800 align:middle line:84%
It's also making
some people crazy.

00:09:20.800 --> 00:09:22.720 align:middle line:84%
It's making other
people step up.

00:09:22.720 --> 00:09:25.780 align:middle line:84%
It's having an interesting
effect on humanity at large.

00:09:25.780 --> 00:09:28.780 align:middle line:84%
So now, this also sets
aside the misunderstanding,

00:09:28.780 --> 00:09:31.450 align:middle line:84%
in a sense, that
the calendar simply

00:09:31.450 --> 00:09:35.170 align:middle line:90%
ended on December 21, 2012.

00:09:35.170 --> 00:09:36.910 align:middle line:90%
That the Mayan calendar ended.

00:09:36.910 --> 00:09:37.960 align:middle line:90%
And you're saying, no.

00:09:37.960 --> 00:09:38.980 align:middle line:90%
>>CARL: Yeah, no.

00:09:38.980 --> 00:09:42.040 align:middle line:84%
The easiest way for people to
actually convince themselves

00:09:42.040 --> 00:09:46.480 align:middle line:84%
that it hasn't ended is to
follow the ninth wave, which

00:09:46.480 --> 00:09:52.690 align:middle line:84%
has such a short 36 day
period that you can actually--

00:09:52.690 --> 00:09:55.090 align:middle line:84%
people that actually
follow that would

00:09:55.090 --> 00:09:58.090 align:middle line:90%
experience the ups and downs.

00:09:58.090 --> 00:10:03.040 align:middle line:84%
Meaning that this still goes
on, all the way still goes on.

00:10:03.040 --> 00:10:05.260 align:middle line:90%
And this is not--

00:10:05.260 --> 00:10:10.330 align:middle line:84%
it's not something of
my making, because there

00:10:10.330 --> 00:10:16.760 align:middle line:84%
are inscriptions from Palenque,
in Chiapas, that talk about,

00:10:16.760 --> 00:10:19.690 align:middle line:90%
for instance, the year 4100.

00:10:19.690 --> 00:10:22.750 align:middle line:84%
And so what that
tells us is that yeah,

00:10:22.750 --> 00:10:24.730 align:middle line:90%
they clearly saw that.

00:10:24.730 --> 00:10:28.545 align:middle line:84%
It wasn't 13 backtun
and then it's over.

00:10:28.545 --> 00:10:29.865 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: It continues on.

00:10:29.865 --> 00:10:30.740 align:middle line:90%
>>CARL: It continues.

00:10:30.740 --> 00:10:36.640 align:middle line:84%
There are dates pointing to
21 backtuns way in the future.

00:10:36.640 --> 00:10:38.770 align:middle line:84%
So they saw that as
an ongoing thing.

00:10:38.770 --> 00:10:42.050 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Where did get the
notion it just ended that day?

00:10:42.050 --> 00:10:44.650 align:middle line:90%
How did that become popularized?

00:10:44.650 --> 00:10:47.830 align:middle line:90%
Was that Jose Arguelles?

00:10:47.830 --> 00:10:50.110 align:middle line:90%
>>CARL: I think, yeah.

00:10:50.110 --> 00:10:54.370 align:middle line:84%
Well, actually ultimately it
goes back to, I would say,

00:10:54.370 --> 00:10:56.490 align:middle line:90%
a mistake by a Mayanist.

00:10:56.490 --> 00:11:00.250 align:middle line:84%
A very reputed,
very well respected

00:11:00.250 --> 00:11:06.220 align:middle line:84%
Mayanist, Michael Cole, who
was a curator at the Yale

00:11:06.220 --> 00:11:10.270 align:middle line:90%
Museum of Mesoamerican things.

00:11:10.270 --> 00:11:12.520 align:middle line:84%
And he wrote a
book, and I read it

00:11:12.520 --> 00:11:15.850 align:middle line:84%
when I was there the
first time in 1979.

00:11:15.850 --> 00:11:22.240 align:middle line:84%
And then he suggests that
the calendar would end--

00:11:22.240 --> 00:11:25.870 align:middle line:84%
actually he wrote 2011, which
I think is the right time.

00:11:25.870 --> 00:11:28.587 align:middle line:90%
But he said--

00:11:28.587 --> 00:11:30.670 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Did he consult
any Mayan elders on this?

00:11:30.670 --> 00:11:31.590 align:middle line:90%
>>CARL: No, I don't think so.

00:11:31.590 --> 00:11:31.810 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: OK.

00:11:31.810 --> 00:11:32.260 align:middle line:90%
There you go.

00:11:32.260 --> 00:11:33.150 align:middle line:90%
But continue.

00:11:33.150 --> 00:11:33.950 align:middle line:90%
>>CARL: Yeah.

00:11:33.950 --> 00:11:38.020 align:middle line:84%
And then he said,
maybe with a bang,

00:11:38.020 --> 00:11:41.320 align:middle line:90%
I think it says in parentheses.

00:11:41.320 --> 00:11:44.590 align:middle line:84%
And so it's a little bit
funny, because these guys,

00:11:44.590 --> 00:11:47.620 align:middle line:84%
the professional
Mayanists, they always

00:11:47.620 --> 00:11:51.100 align:middle line:84%
try to make it, oh,
we're not New Agey.

00:11:51.100 --> 00:11:52.150 align:middle line:90%
No, no, no, no.

00:11:52.150 --> 00:11:53.320 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Pure science.

00:11:53.320 --> 00:11:54.510 align:middle line:90%
>>CARL: Pure science.

00:11:54.510 --> 00:11:57.970 align:middle line:84%
But this story actually
comes from what

00:11:57.970 --> 00:12:03.340 align:middle line:84%
might be in the late 20th
century, the most respected

00:12:03.340 --> 00:12:05.960 align:middle line:90%
archaeologist in this area.

00:12:05.960 --> 00:12:07.430 align:middle line:90%
But he made it up.

00:12:07.430 --> 00:12:08.230 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: OK.

00:12:08.230 --> 00:12:09.030 align:middle line:90%
There you go.

00:12:09.030 --> 00:12:10.300 align:middle line:90%
So it turns out, it continues.

00:12:10.300 --> 00:12:11.140 align:middle line:90%
Life continues.

00:12:11.140 --> 00:12:12.200 align:middle line:90%
The universe continues.

00:12:12.200 --> 00:12:12.770 align:middle line:90%
We continue.

00:12:12.770 --> 00:12:13.900 align:middle line:90%
>>CARL: At least it's meant to.

00:12:13.900 --> 00:12:14.440 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:12:14.440 --> 00:12:15.240 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

00:12:15.240 --> 00:12:17.050 align:middle line:84%
So now let's get into
the waves themselves.

00:12:17.050 --> 00:12:19.750 align:middle line:84%
So because the
ninth wave is really

00:12:19.750 --> 00:12:22.150 align:middle line:84%
what we're going to focus
on, but what leads up to it

00:12:22.150 --> 00:12:23.300 align:middle line:90%
is interesting.

00:12:23.300 --> 00:12:25.300 align:middle line:84%
Let's talk about the
first four waves,

00:12:25.300 --> 00:12:28.210 align:middle line:84%
and even go back historically
and maybe just peg

00:12:28.210 --> 00:12:30.730 align:middle line:84%
a period, an empire
or an event or two,

00:12:30.730 --> 00:12:35.040 align:middle line:84%
to each of the waves leading
up to the sixth wave.

00:12:35.040 --> 00:12:35.840 align:middle line:90%
>>CARL: OK.

00:12:35.840 --> 00:12:36.790 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:12:36.790 --> 00:12:37.240 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:12:37.240 --> 00:12:38.650 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So people
know where we've been

00:12:38.650 --> 00:12:40.030 align:middle line:84%
and can kind of see
it in their minds.

00:12:40.030 --> 00:12:40.830 align:middle line:90%
>>CARL: Yeah.

00:12:40.830 --> 00:12:46.000 align:middle line:84%
Well, the waves, then, it seems
like they are building up.

00:12:46.000 --> 00:12:50.200 align:middle line:84%
First the four lowest levels,
the four bottom levels,

00:12:50.200 --> 00:12:56.830 align:middle line:84%
is basically about creating
the biology of the human being.

00:12:56.830 --> 00:12:58.420 align:middle line:90%
So it's a series--

00:12:58.420 --> 00:13:01.940 align:middle line:84%
the first wave just
creates the first cells.

00:13:01.940 --> 00:13:05.770 align:middle line:84%
The second level creates
plants and animals.

00:13:05.770 --> 00:13:11.790 align:middle line:84%
The third level creates upright
walking people, or monkeys,

00:13:11.790 --> 00:13:13.930 align:middle line:90%
or primates or so fourth.

00:13:13.930 --> 00:13:16.870 align:middle line:84%
And then the fourth wave,
it has this expansion

00:13:16.870 --> 00:13:18.760 align:middle line:90%
of the human brain size.

00:13:18.760 --> 00:13:23.030 align:middle line:84%
And then it leads up to what
we, biologically speaking,

00:13:23.030 --> 00:13:23.830 align:middle line:90%
are now--

00:13:23.830 --> 00:13:25.020 align:middle line:90%
Homo sapiens.

00:13:25.020 --> 00:13:26.210 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Modern humans.

00:13:26.210 --> 00:13:26.560 align:middle line:90%
>>CARL: Yes.

00:13:26.560 --> 00:13:27.360 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: OK.

00:13:27.360 --> 00:13:31.870 align:middle line:84%
So in their belief, is there
a central creative force,

00:13:31.870 --> 00:13:34.750 align:middle line:84%
or mind, or god
of some kind that

00:13:34.750 --> 00:13:36.430 align:middle line:90%
sets these waves in motion?

00:13:36.430 --> 00:13:39.340 align:middle line:84%
What are these
waves emanate from,

00:13:39.340 --> 00:13:42.040 align:middle line:84%
and what is the creative
force in creating

00:13:42.040 --> 00:13:45.690 align:middle line:84%
the templates that create the
cells that create, et cetera?

00:13:45.690 --> 00:13:47.277 align:middle line:90%
>>CARL: Yeah.

00:13:47.277 --> 00:13:48.610 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Just a small question.

00:13:48.610 --> 00:13:50.650 align:middle line:84%
>>CARL: Yeah, just
a small question.

00:13:50.650 --> 00:13:53.740 align:middle line:90%
And it really makes you wonder.

00:13:53.740 --> 00:13:58.510 align:middle line:84%
But I can tell you what the
ancient Maya seemed to believe.

00:13:58.510 --> 00:14:00.910 align:middle line:84%
So they have this
place in the center

00:14:00.910 --> 00:14:07.090 align:middle line:84%
of the universe, which is also
the center of the Tree of Life.

00:14:07.090 --> 00:14:12.310 align:middle line:84%
And then they say, in
that place, in that center

00:14:12.310 --> 00:14:17.470 align:middle line:84%
they talk about somebody
who is the first father.

00:14:17.470 --> 00:14:24.990 align:middle line:84%
And he erects the world
tree, according to one.

00:14:24.990 --> 00:14:27.170 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So creates
and conceives of.

00:14:27.170 --> 00:14:31.450 align:middle line:90%
>>CARL: That's how I read it.

00:14:31.450 --> 00:14:35.070 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Which is almost
ever of the world's faiths

00:14:35.070 --> 00:14:36.830 align:middle line:84%
and religions and
traditions have--

00:14:36.830 --> 00:14:39.260 align:middle line:84%
there's a creative mind that
precipitates everything.

00:14:39.260 --> 00:14:40.060 align:middle line:90%
>>CARL: Yeah.

00:14:40.060 --> 00:14:40.860 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:14:40.860 --> 00:14:44.560 align:middle line:84%
But it's also-- something that's
also noteworthy is that it

00:14:44.560 --> 00:14:49.180 align:middle line:84%
seems like they looked
upon it as if the gods--

00:14:49.180 --> 00:14:52.540 align:middle line:84%
and the gods then is the Plumed
Serpent, the Tree of Life,

00:14:52.540 --> 00:14:55.540 align:middle line:84%
and the Heart of the
Heavens, so to speak.

00:14:55.540 --> 00:14:59.470 align:middle line:84%
That they gathered
before creation.

00:14:59.470 --> 00:15:00.690 align:middle line:90%
So they gathered--

00:15:00.690 --> 00:15:03.500 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So they help really
engineer the materialization

00:15:03.500 --> 00:15:04.300 align:middle line:90%
of these things.

00:15:04.300 --> 00:15:05.110 align:middle line:90%
>>CARL: Yeah, exactly.

00:15:05.110 --> 00:15:05.910 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: OK.

00:15:05.910 --> 00:15:07.630 align:middle line:84%
>>CARL: And then
creation begins.

00:15:07.630 --> 00:15:08.430 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: OK.

00:15:08.430 --> 00:15:10.030 align:middle line:84%
So it's a team of
people that creates.

00:15:10.030 --> 00:15:11.020 align:middle line:90%
>>CARL: It's a team.

00:15:11.020 --> 00:15:11.990 align:middle line:90%
It's a team.

00:15:11.990 --> 00:15:13.540 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Of beings, of gods.

00:15:13.540 --> 00:15:15.070 align:middle line:90%
>>CARL: Clear teamwork, yes.

00:15:15.070 --> 00:15:15.480 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Teamwork.

00:15:15.480 --> 00:15:16.280 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:15:16.280 --> 00:15:17.700 align:middle line:84%
So now we're up
through the four--

00:15:17.700 --> 00:15:19.810 align:middle line:84%
so we have kind of
upright Homo sapiens.

00:15:19.810 --> 00:15:20.620 align:middle line:90%
>>CARL: Yeah.

00:15:20.620 --> 00:15:22.245 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: First of
all, do they believe

00:15:22.245 --> 00:15:24.100 align:middle line:84%
that this species,
this type of process,

00:15:24.100 --> 00:15:27.160 align:middle line:90%
happens elsewhere in the cosmos?

00:15:27.160 --> 00:15:29.410 align:middle line:84%
That there are many
other places populated

00:15:29.410 --> 00:15:32.420 align:middle line:84%
that go through this process
and populated with people?

00:15:32.420 --> 00:15:34.338 align:middle line:90%
>>CARL: That's not something--

00:15:34.338 --> 00:15:35.880 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: They don't
really focus on?

00:15:35.880 --> 00:15:39.070 align:middle line:84%
>>CARL: They don't focus on
it, but it would be logical.

00:15:39.070 --> 00:15:42.160 align:middle line:84%
If there is the center
of the universe that

00:15:42.160 --> 00:15:45.440 align:middle line:84%
creates these projections,
they will go out everywhere.

00:15:45.440 --> 00:15:46.240 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:15:46.240 --> 00:15:49.030 align:middle line:84%
>>CARL: And then the
logical conclusion

00:15:49.030 --> 00:15:54.100 align:middle line:84%
would be that wherever there is
a living planet or conditions

00:15:54.100 --> 00:15:55.690 align:middle line:84%
are there, then
you would have life

00:15:55.690 --> 00:15:58.898 align:middle line:84%
and the same kind of evolution
according to the same waves.

00:15:58.898 --> 00:16:00.190 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Well, it makes sense.

00:16:00.190 --> 00:16:01.900 align:middle line:84%
I mean, especially
coming from that kind

00:16:01.900 --> 00:16:05.350 align:middle line:84%
of large cosmological
overview, but even coming

00:16:05.350 --> 00:16:08.200 align:middle line:90%
from the more macro view.

00:16:08.200 --> 00:16:11.080 align:middle line:84%
Forbes magazine-- Forbes
magazine came out yesterday

00:16:11.080 --> 00:16:13.023 align:middle line:84%
with an article
stating that they

00:16:13.023 --> 00:16:14.440 align:middle line:84%
have done the
calculations, and it

00:16:14.440 --> 00:16:18.160 align:middle line:84%
appears there are at least
36 other intelligent species

00:16:18.160 --> 00:16:19.300 align:middle line:90%
throughout the universe.

00:16:19.300 --> 00:16:21.310 align:middle line:90%
And I thought, great.

00:16:21.310 --> 00:16:24.460 align:middle line:84%
It could be 36
million, 36,000, 3,600.

00:16:24.460 --> 00:16:27.730 align:middle line:84%
But even acknowledging
there are 36 in Forbes,

00:16:27.730 --> 00:16:30.050 align:middle line:84%
it's time we don't giggle
about this stuff anymore.

00:16:30.050 --> 00:16:30.850 align:middle line:90%
>>CARL: No, no.

00:16:30.850 --> 00:16:32.050 align:middle line:90%
I mean, it's just logical.

00:16:32.050 --> 00:16:32.890 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: It's just logical.

00:16:32.890 --> 00:16:33.490 align:middle line:90%
>>CARL: It's just logical.

00:16:33.490 --> 00:16:33.880 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:16:33.880 --> 00:16:35.005 align:middle line:90%
So that's kind of an aside.

00:16:35.005 --> 00:16:38.950 align:middle line:84%
>>CARL: I should say, logical
according to this kind of idea

00:16:38.950 --> 00:16:40.340 align:middle line:90%
that the universe is created.

00:16:40.340 --> 00:16:41.140 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:16:41.140 --> 00:16:45.610 align:middle line:84%
>>CARL: If you're a
biologist in a university,

00:16:45.610 --> 00:16:48.290 align:middle line:84%
you think life came
out by an accident.

00:16:48.290 --> 00:16:49.090 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:16:49.090 --> 00:16:51.220 align:middle line:90%
Well.

00:16:51.220 --> 00:16:53.950 align:middle line:84%
So we have this-- and
this kind of sine wave

00:16:53.950 --> 00:16:56.470 align:middle line:84%
is kind of like the ladder
to heaven, so to speak,

00:16:56.470 --> 00:16:57.640 align:middle line:90%
going up through the waves.

00:16:57.640 --> 00:17:00.370 align:middle line:84%
Now, let's focus for a
moment on the fifth wave.

00:17:00.370 --> 00:17:03.053 align:middle line:84%
And what was what
humans were up to?

00:17:03.053 --> 00:17:04.720 align:middle line:84%
We're going to keep
this discussion just

00:17:04.720 --> 00:17:06.170 align:middle line:90%
to the human species.

00:17:06.170 --> 00:17:06.970 align:middle line:90%
>>CARL: Yes.

00:17:06.970 --> 00:17:09.730 align:middle line:84%
So the fifth wave is
sort of the midpoint

00:17:09.730 --> 00:17:11.619 align:middle line:90%
of the climb to the top.

00:17:11.619 --> 00:17:15.849 align:middle line:84%
And that's when human
beings become something more

00:17:15.849 --> 00:17:19.690 align:middle line:84%
than animals, you might say,
as far as we can gather.

00:17:19.690 --> 00:17:23.980 align:middle line:84%
Because we do know that there
are evidence from South Africa

00:17:23.980 --> 00:17:26.829 align:middle line:84%
about 100,000 years
ago when this started,

00:17:26.829 --> 00:17:30.220 align:middle line:84%
this wave started, where
they show that people

00:17:30.220 --> 00:17:32.170 align:middle line:90%
started to make art.

00:17:32.170 --> 00:17:34.720 align:middle line:84%
And we do know
that people started

00:17:34.720 --> 00:17:39.580 align:middle line:84%
to bury their
ancestors, and also

00:17:39.580 --> 00:17:41.780 align:middle line:90%
even decorate the burial sites.

00:17:41.780 --> 00:17:42.580 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:17:42.580 --> 00:17:45.040 align:middle line:84%
So cultural practices
and traditions and such

00:17:45.040 --> 00:17:46.030 align:middle line:90%
were given birth to.

00:17:46.030 --> 00:17:48.520 align:middle line:84%
More sophisticated way of
relating to one another

00:17:48.520 --> 00:17:50.000 align:middle line:90%
and our place in the world.

00:17:50.000 --> 00:17:50.800 align:middle line:90%
>>CARL: Yeah.

00:17:50.800 --> 00:17:51.470 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:17:51.470 --> 00:17:52.270 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:17:52.270 --> 00:17:54.400 align:middle line:84%
>>CARL: And started
to create symbols.

00:17:54.400 --> 00:17:58.420 align:middle line:84%
You can think that
maybe they, you know,

00:17:58.420 --> 00:18:00.820 align:middle line:84%
there's some kind of
spirituality in it

00:18:00.820 --> 00:18:03.790 align:middle line:84%
the whole idea of saying
that maybe this person

00:18:03.790 --> 00:18:07.907 align:middle line:84%
we need to bury and it
will go on somewhere else.

00:18:07.907 --> 00:18:09.240 align:middle line:90%
So we need to honor or whatever.

00:18:09.240 --> 00:18:12.760 align:middle line:90%


00:18:12.760 --> 00:18:17.080 align:middle line:84%
It takes a very long
time, about 100,000 years,

00:18:17.080 --> 00:18:18.820 align:middle line:90%
this particular wave.

00:18:18.820 --> 00:18:21.380 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Because they
start decreasing in length,

00:18:21.380 --> 00:18:23.320 align:middle line:84%
these waves, as
you go further in.

00:18:23.320 --> 00:18:25.390 align:middle line:84%
So that's important that
you brought that up.

00:18:25.390 --> 00:18:27.700 align:middle line:84%
So what happens--
how much time has

00:18:27.700 --> 00:18:29.740 align:middle line:84%
passed before you
get to the sixth wave

00:18:29.740 --> 00:18:30.730 align:middle line:90%
and what it represents?

00:18:30.730 --> 00:18:34.960 align:middle line:84%
Because we're still living
off of the more corrupted

00:18:34.960 --> 00:18:36.652 align:middle line:90%
influences of that sixth wave.

00:18:36.652 --> 00:18:38.110 align:middle line:84%
So let's talk about
the sixth wave.

00:18:38.110 --> 00:18:38.790 align:middle line:90%
>>CARL: Yeah.

00:18:38.790 --> 00:18:39.590 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:18:39.590 --> 00:18:45.250 align:middle line:84%
The sixth wave, then, is the one
that started 5,100 years ago.

00:18:45.250 --> 00:18:48.520 align:middle line:84%
And it begins what is
usually called the Long

00:18:48.520 --> 00:18:50.470 align:middle line:90%
Count to the Maya.

00:18:50.470 --> 00:18:54.820 align:middle line:84%
And that's really what
formed the whole basis

00:18:54.820 --> 00:19:00.460 align:middle line:84%
of the discussion of the Mayan
calendar a couple of years ago.

00:19:00.460 --> 00:19:04.190 align:middle line:84%
And it creates
basically civilization.

00:19:04.190 --> 00:19:06.940 align:middle line:90%
It also creates dominance.

00:19:06.940 --> 00:19:12.940 align:middle line:84%
It also creates unequal
relationships of all kinds.

00:19:12.940 --> 00:19:15.150 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Hierarchical
stratified society.

00:19:15.150 --> 00:19:17.620 align:middle line:90%
>>CARL: Stratified society.

00:19:17.620 --> 00:19:25.690 align:middle line:84%
And presumably, from what we
can gather, before that people

00:19:25.690 --> 00:19:31.570 align:middle line:84%
lived in more communal settings
and without anybody dominating,

00:19:31.570 --> 00:19:33.040 align:middle line:90%
as far as we can tell.

00:19:33.040 --> 00:19:34.210 align:middle line:90%
And so forth.

00:19:34.210 --> 00:19:37.810 align:middle line:84%
No warfare before
that point in time.

00:19:37.810 --> 00:19:39.273 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Also more patriarchal.

00:19:39.273 --> 00:19:40.315 align:middle line:90%
>>CARL: More patriarchal.

00:19:40.315 --> 00:19:41.210 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: The
fifth became more--

00:19:41.210 --> 00:19:41.800 align:middle line:90%
>>CARL: Sixth.

00:19:41.800 --> 00:19:43.320 align:middle line:84%
The sixth wave being
more patriarchal.

00:19:43.320 --> 00:19:43.670 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Sixth.

00:19:43.670 --> 00:19:44.900 align:middle line:90%
Excuse me, sixth wave.

00:19:44.900 --> 00:19:45.290 align:middle line:90%
>>CARL: Yeah.

00:19:45.290 --> 00:19:46.090 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:19:46.090 --> 00:19:48.130 align:middle line:90%


00:19:48.130 --> 00:19:50.440 align:middle line:84%
And the way I
would explain it is

00:19:50.440 --> 00:19:56.620 align:middle line:84%
that the slide, the
geometric quantum state that

00:19:56.620 --> 00:20:01.450 align:middle line:84%
starts to be emitted then from
the center of the universe, it

00:20:01.450 --> 00:20:06.010 align:middle line:84%
holds that genuine duality,
black white duality.

00:20:06.010 --> 00:20:10.690 align:middle line:84%
And then when we download
that, because the waves,

00:20:10.690 --> 00:20:13.570 align:middle line:84%
our brains download
these waves, then we

00:20:13.570 --> 00:20:19.830 align:middle line:84%
start to look at everybody
else, or the world around us,

00:20:19.830 --> 00:20:23.580 align:middle line:84%
through this filter of
dominance basically.

00:20:23.580 --> 00:20:28.260 align:middle line:84%
And we think some
are the pharaohs,

00:20:28.260 --> 00:20:30.430 align:middle line:84%
and they are great up
there, so to speak.

00:20:30.430 --> 00:20:33.060 align:middle line:84%
And the rest are slaves
and they are down there.

00:20:33.060 --> 00:20:36.060 align:middle line:84%
But from this
perspective, it's actually

00:20:36.060 --> 00:20:39.360 align:middle line:84%
a state of consciousness
that creates

00:20:39.360 --> 00:20:42.000 align:middle line:90%
our perception of reality.

00:20:42.000 --> 00:20:44.580 align:middle line:84%
Like this comes from the
center of the universe,

00:20:44.580 --> 00:20:47.340 align:middle line:84%
it must be God
given, so to speak.

00:20:47.340 --> 00:20:51.030 align:middle line:84%
In a sense it is, because
I presume civilization

00:20:51.030 --> 00:20:52.440 align:middle line:90%
was meant to happen.

00:20:52.440 --> 00:20:55.500 align:middle line:84%
But on the other hand,
there is this other aspect

00:20:55.500 --> 00:21:01.140 align:middle line:84%
of this duality that creates
separateness and dominance.

00:21:01.140 --> 00:21:02.850 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So it was
how we as a species

00:21:02.850 --> 00:21:06.630 align:middle line:84%
took it up and responded
to that energy.

00:21:06.630 --> 00:21:09.330 align:middle line:84%
And so we can look at it from
the positive point of view

00:21:09.330 --> 00:21:12.180 align:middle line:84%
that it was time for perhaps
the population of the Earth

00:21:12.180 --> 00:21:14.850 align:middle line:84%
had grown to an extent that
larger civilization patterns

00:21:14.850 --> 00:21:17.510 align:middle line:84%
needed to be established
on some level.

00:21:17.510 --> 00:21:18.480 align:middle line:90%
Right?

00:21:18.480 --> 00:21:20.490 align:middle line:84%
I don't understand
the need for dominance

00:21:20.490 --> 00:21:22.560 align:middle line:84%
in that kind of
hierarchy, but I suppose

00:21:22.560 --> 00:21:24.900 align:middle line:84%
when you get enough people
in a room it's inevitable.

00:21:24.900 --> 00:21:27.878 align:middle line:84%
The most dominant end
up taking that place.

00:21:27.878 --> 00:21:29.920 align:middle line:84%
And then when you have
that wave of consciousness

00:21:29.920 --> 00:21:31.530 align:middle line:84%
that's creating
that stratification

00:21:31.530 --> 00:21:33.600 align:middle line:84%
in black and white,
it's inevitable some

00:21:33.600 --> 00:21:36.960 align:middle line:84%
are going to end up on top and
some will be on the bottom.

00:21:36.960 --> 00:21:38.440 align:middle line:84%
And if you look at
it more from a--

00:21:38.440 --> 00:21:42.630 align:middle line:84%
I look at it from an incarnation
point of view, repeated

00:21:42.630 --> 00:21:45.177 align:middle line:90%
incarnations and learning.

00:21:45.177 --> 00:21:47.010 align:middle line:84%
I guess that would give
you a window of time

00:21:47.010 --> 00:21:51.450 align:middle line:84%
to play with what it's
like to be the exploited

00:21:51.450 --> 00:21:54.090 align:middle line:84%
and to be the exploiter,
and kind of have all

00:21:54.090 --> 00:21:57.465 align:middle line:84%
these experiences until you come
to what we're going to come to

00:21:57.465 --> 00:21:58.590 align:middle line:90%
in the ninth wave in a bit.

00:21:58.590 --> 00:21:59.640 align:middle line:90%
But this is a playground.

00:21:59.640 --> 00:22:00.440 align:middle line:90%
>>CARL: Yeah.

00:22:00.440 --> 00:22:02.280 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: It's a
challenging playground.

00:22:02.280 --> 00:22:04.950 align:middle line:84%
We've really messed
up in a lot of ways.

00:22:04.950 --> 00:22:06.990 align:middle line:90%
Maybe could be worse.

00:22:06.990 --> 00:22:08.580 align:middle line:84%
Could be worse, it
used to be worse.

00:22:08.580 --> 00:22:10.788 align:middle line:84%
I think we're better than
we were even 100 years ago.

00:22:10.788 --> 00:22:12.050 align:middle line:90%
>>CARL: I would say so, too.

00:22:12.050 --> 00:22:12.270 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:22:12.270 --> 00:22:13.070 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:22:13.070 --> 00:22:15.342 align:middle line:84%
We are evolving within this,
and some beautiful things

00:22:15.342 --> 00:22:16.800 align:middle line:84%
are starting to
happen as a result.

00:22:16.800 --> 00:22:19.860 align:middle line:84%
But let's not skip
over what happens then

00:22:19.860 --> 00:22:22.680 align:middle line:84%
when the seventh wave hit,
and then the eighth wave

00:22:22.680 --> 00:22:23.940 align:middle line:90%
and what they brought in.

00:22:23.940 --> 00:22:27.780 align:middle line:84%
But also this notion
of the sine wave

00:22:27.780 --> 00:22:30.270 align:middle line:90%
has an incline and a decline.

00:22:30.270 --> 00:22:31.420 align:middle line:90%
And this is natural.

00:22:31.420 --> 00:22:32.220 align:middle line:90%
Right?

00:22:32.220 --> 00:22:32.580 align:middle line:90%
>>CARL: Yeah.

00:22:32.580 --> 00:22:34.290 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So we have an
incline in consciousness,

00:22:34.290 --> 00:22:35.280 align:middle line:90%
everything moves.

00:22:35.280 --> 00:22:37.770 align:middle line:84%
Renaissance period
things, start flowering.

00:22:37.770 --> 00:22:39.820 align:middle line:90%
Creativity is abundant.

00:22:39.820 --> 00:22:42.550 align:middle line:84%
And then you go down the other
slippery slope for a while.

00:22:42.550 --> 00:22:44.580 align:middle line:90%
So where are we right now?

00:22:44.580 --> 00:22:46.590 align:middle line:84%
What was the height
of the wave we're

00:22:46.590 --> 00:22:48.510 align:middle line:90%
in, and where are we right now?

00:22:48.510 --> 00:22:52.940 align:middle line:84%
>>CARL: Well, in terms
of the sixth wave,

00:22:52.940 --> 00:22:55.600 align:middle line:90%
we've just gone into a dark age.

00:22:55.600 --> 00:22:59.610 align:middle line:84%
We've gone down and
it's beginning--

00:22:59.610 --> 00:23:05.700 align:middle line:84%
there was a peak then
from 1617 to 2011.

00:23:05.700 --> 00:23:08.670 align:middle line:84%
And that's really
the peak that created

00:23:08.670 --> 00:23:12.540 align:middle line:84%
what we know-- a global
civilization, basically driven

00:23:12.540 --> 00:23:15.720 align:middle line:90%
by the West.

00:23:15.720 --> 00:23:18.360 align:middle line:90%
But now that has turned.

00:23:18.360 --> 00:23:23.790 align:middle line:84%
And this is part of many
different civilizations

00:23:23.790 --> 00:23:25.215 align:middle line:90%
in the past--

00:23:25.215 --> 00:23:28.250 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: The Vedic
traditions, rise and fall.

00:23:28.250 --> 00:23:29.200 align:middle line:90%
The Yuga cycles.

00:23:29.200 --> 00:23:30.260 align:middle line:90%
Absolutely.

00:23:30.260 --> 00:23:31.650 align:middle line:90%
>>CARL: Yeah.

00:23:31.650 --> 00:23:36.210 align:middle line:84%
But the reason I think the
Maya are so interesting

00:23:36.210 --> 00:23:38.490 align:middle line:84%
and I was guided
to work with them

00:23:38.490 --> 00:23:42.210 align:middle line:84%
is really that they give
timings for these things.

00:23:42.210 --> 00:23:46.580 align:middle line:84%
And that means that for me as
a scientist, modern scientist

00:23:46.580 --> 00:23:49.350 align:middle line:84%
so to speak, I can
sit there and check,

00:23:49.350 --> 00:23:52.080 align:middle line:84%
does this date
match with anything

00:23:52.080 --> 00:23:53.970 align:middle line:90%
that we know from history?

00:23:53.970 --> 00:23:57.340 align:middle line:84%
And it's just absolutely
amazing how much actually fits.

00:23:57.340 --> 00:23:58.140 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:23:58.140 --> 00:23:59.880 align:middle line:84%
At the top of this
particular wave

00:23:59.880 --> 00:24:02.730 align:middle line:84%
you see the establishment
of the British Empire,

00:24:02.730 --> 00:24:06.700 align:middle line:84%
America comes into the picture
as dominant powers in the room.

00:24:06.700 --> 00:24:08.680 align:middle line:90%
And again, this is dominance.

00:24:08.680 --> 00:24:10.620 align:middle line:90%
>>CARL: Yeah, it is.

00:24:10.620 --> 00:24:11.620 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: So here we go.

00:24:11.620 --> 00:24:14.160 align:middle line:90%
So now we're on the other side.

00:24:14.160 --> 00:24:16.650 align:middle line:84%
We're going into
a declining level

00:24:16.650 --> 00:24:20.080 align:middle line:90%
or state of consciousness.

00:24:20.080 --> 00:24:22.410 align:middle line:84%
And so let's talk about
what that brings with us.

00:24:22.410 --> 00:24:24.840 align:middle line:84%
Because I do want to get
into this notion of what

00:24:24.840 --> 00:24:29.040 align:middle line:84%
happens when conspiracy
starts coming into a society.

00:24:29.040 --> 00:24:31.960 align:middle line:84%
Into a person, into a
group, into a society.

00:24:31.960 --> 00:24:32.760 align:middle line:90%
>>CARL: Yeah.

00:24:32.760 --> 00:24:35.470 align:middle line:90%
Well, that's a big question.

00:24:35.470 --> 00:24:38.670 align:middle line:84%
And there are many
aspects of it.

00:24:38.670 --> 00:24:45.120 align:middle line:84%
But as far as I can understand
it from the cosmic center,

00:24:45.120 --> 00:24:48.870 align:middle line:84%
in this peak period
that we had--

00:24:48.870 --> 00:24:52.890 align:middle line:84%
it was a division so that
the West was favored,

00:24:52.890 --> 00:24:54.650 align:middle line:90%
the East was disfavored.

00:24:54.650 --> 00:25:02.070 align:middle line:84%
The left brain half was favored
and the right brain half

00:25:02.070 --> 00:25:05.400 align:middle line:90%
was disfavored in this period.

00:25:05.400 --> 00:25:10.780 align:middle line:84%
And then when it goes into dark,
both are sort of disfavored.

00:25:10.780 --> 00:25:13.980 align:middle line:84%
And you can, you
know, I think there

00:25:13.980 --> 00:25:16.660 align:middle line:90%
are several things you can see.

00:25:16.660 --> 00:25:20.290 align:middle line:84%
First of all, these
past 10 years,

00:25:20.290 --> 00:25:24.220 align:middle line:84%
you've never heard
the word unprecedented

00:25:24.220 --> 00:25:25.150 align:middle line:90%
being used so much.

00:25:25.150 --> 00:25:26.150 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: So many times.

00:25:26.150 --> 00:25:26.950 align:middle line:90%
It's true.

00:25:26.950 --> 00:25:28.930 align:middle line:90%
>>CARL: It's unprecedented.

00:25:28.930 --> 00:25:29.920 align:middle line:90%
Why?

00:25:29.920 --> 00:25:33.340 align:middle line:84%
Because the quantum
state is different now.

00:25:33.340 --> 00:25:37.900 align:middle line:84%
So whatever we grew up with
was a completely different set

00:25:37.900 --> 00:25:41.020 align:middle line:90%
of values and so forth.

00:25:41.020 --> 00:25:51.000 align:middle line:84%
But if you just look at
the situation in America,

00:25:51.000 --> 00:25:53.290 align:middle line:90%
it also equalizes.

00:25:53.290 --> 00:25:58.840 align:middle line:84%
If both sides are dark, then
there is in a sense balance.

00:25:58.840 --> 00:26:03.550 align:middle line:84%
And so you in these 10 years
since this quantum shift

00:26:03.550 --> 00:26:07.660 align:middle line:84%
happened, you've had the big
MeToo movement, and so forth.

00:26:07.660 --> 00:26:09.430 align:middle line:84%
And I would say
most of these things

00:26:09.430 --> 00:26:15.490 align:middle line:84%
were completely
unthinkable before to 2011.

00:26:15.490 --> 00:26:16.450 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: I think so.

00:26:16.450 --> 00:26:21.200 align:middle line:84%
I mean, this to me
is really watching

00:26:21.200 --> 00:26:22.870 align:middle line:84%
the higher end of
the consciousness

00:26:22.870 --> 00:26:24.850 align:middle line:90%
on that scale rising.

00:26:24.850 --> 00:26:28.840 align:middle line:84%
And when we get to the ninth
wave, it'll make sense.

00:26:28.840 --> 00:26:34.060 align:middle line:84%
But passing through this right
now, the amount of division

00:26:34.060 --> 00:26:35.050 align:middle line:90%
emits this.

00:26:35.050 --> 00:26:38.030 align:middle line:84%
We've acknowledged a few
really good things happening.

00:26:38.030 --> 00:26:40.660 align:middle line:84%
But emits that on
the home front,

00:26:40.660 --> 00:26:44.890 align:middle line:84%
in schools, in office places,
and everywhere around the world

00:26:44.890 --> 00:26:47.890 align:middle line:84%
right now, and certainly
in the United States.

00:26:47.890 --> 00:26:49.990 align:middle line:84%
This is why I wanted to
talk about conspiracy.

00:26:49.990 --> 00:26:54.490 align:middle line:84%
In this wave of consciousness,
as I was reading in your work,

00:26:54.490 --> 00:26:58.090 align:middle line:84%
we go into states of we
know something's not right.

00:26:58.090 --> 00:26:59.800 align:middle line:90%
We're not accessing the truth.

00:26:59.800 --> 00:27:01.570 align:middle line:90%
We start becoming suspicious.

00:27:01.570 --> 00:27:04.840 align:middle line:84%
>>CARL: And we know that it
comes from somewhere else.

00:27:04.840 --> 00:27:05.860 align:middle line:90%
It's not here.

00:27:05.860 --> 00:27:06.660 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Exactly.

00:27:06.660 --> 00:27:09.295 align:middle line:84%
>>CARL: And we know it's
that, but nobody tells you.

00:27:09.295 --> 00:27:10.420 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: No one tells you.

00:27:10.420 --> 00:27:12.700 align:middle line:84%
It just feels like
something's not right.

00:27:12.700 --> 00:27:15.580 align:middle line:84%
And then you start thinking,
OK, who's out to get me?

00:27:15.580 --> 00:27:16.395 align:middle line:90%
Who's lying to me?

00:27:16.395 --> 00:27:18.020 align:middle line:84%
I'm going to get to
the bottom of this.

00:27:18.020 --> 00:27:21.418 align:middle line:84%
And go over the last 10
years, conspiracy theory,

00:27:21.418 --> 00:27:22.960 align:middle line:84%
which a lot of times
it isn't theory,

00:27:22.960 --> 00:27:24.960 align:middle line:84%
it's just facts that are
difficult to deal with.

00:27:24.960 --> 00:27:28.750 align:middle line:84%
But conspiracy theory
has just mushroomed

00:27:28.750 --> 00:27:31.360 align:middle line:90%
to an absolutely absurd extent.

00:27:31.360 --> 00:27:34.030 align:middle line:84%
Now we have disinformation
artists planted all over.

00:27:34.030 --> 00:27:36.520 align:middle line:84%
No one can tell the difference
between right information

00:27:36.520 --> 00:27:38.140 align:middle line:90%
and disinformation.

00:27:38.140 --> 00:27:42.700 align:middle line:84%
It's literal insanity out
there in that world now.

00:27:42.700 --> 00:27:44.890 align:middle line:84%
And what you said that
was so interesting in one

00:27:44.890 --> 00:27:48.760 align:middle line:84%
of the articles I read was
that when that mindset becomes

00:27:48.760 --> 00:27:53.230 align:middle line:84%
collective, really
becomes entrenched,

00:27:53.230 --> 00:27:55.570 align:middle line:84%
the suspicion and
division is so deep

00:27:55.570 --> 00:27:57.490 align:middle line:84%
that empires,
societies, countries

00:27:57.490 --> 00:27:59.270 align:middle line:84%
fall at the hands of
conspiracy theory.

00:27:59.270 --> 00:28:00.070 align:middle line:90%
>>CARL: Right.

00:28:00.070 --> 00:28:01.370 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Talk about
that for a bit.

00:28:01.370 --> 00:28:02.530 align:middle line:90%
We need to understand this.

00:28:02.530 --> 00:28:03.330 align:middle line:90%
>>CARL: Yeah.

00:28:03.330 --> 00:28:05.140 align:middle line:90%
The quantum state has darkened.

00:28:05.140 --> 00:28:07.990 align:middle line:84%
It's a darkened
filter that comes out.

00:28:07.990 --> 00:28:10.840 align:middle line:84%
And it didn't used
to be darkened up

00:28:10.840 --> 00:28:13.660 align:middle line:90%
until 2011, basically.

00:28:13.660 --> 00:28:17.770 align:middle line:10%
Now what's happened when
that darkened filter becomes

00:28:17.770 --> 00:28:24.310 align:middle line:10%
what we resonate with, whether
we are aware of it or not.

00:28:24.310 --> 00:28:28.370 align:middle line:84%
It's that suddenly all the
things that people used

00:28:28.370 --> 00:28:30.080 align:middle line:90%
to think were good values--

00:28:30.080 --> 00:28:32.960 align:middle line:84%
that's a good person,
he's respected,

00:28:32.960 --> 00:28:36.330 align:middle line:84%
he did that, she did
that, cetera, et cetera.

00:28:36.330 --> 00:28:37.880 align:middle line:90%
That's been shifted.

00:28:37.880 --> 00:28:40.030 align:middle line:90%
So now everything--

00:28:40.030 --> 00:28:41.720 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Is going
through a dark lens.

00:28:41.720 --> 00:28:44.240 align:middle line:84%
>>CARL: Everything
gets torn down.

00:28:44.240 --> 00:28:46.730 align:middle line:84%
Whoever was an
ideal in those days,

00:28:46.730 --> 00:28:50.930 align:middle line:84%
well they will associate him
or her with some pedophile ring

00:28:50.930 --> 00:28:53.300 align:middle line:90%
or whatever it is like that.

00:28:53.300 --> 00:28:56.690 align:middle line:84%
Because that is
somehow to make sense

00:28:56.690 --> 00:28:59.750 align:middle line:84%
of how they see things
through this lens,

00:28:59.750 --> 00:29:02.285 align:middle line:90%
they have tear everything down.

00:29:02.285 --> 00:29:04.160 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: You have to
make the external world

00:29:04.160 --> 00:29:05.660 align:middle line:84%
match what you're going
through internally.

00:29:05.660 --> 00:29:06.650 align:middle line:90%
>>CARL: Yes, exactly.

00:29:06.650 --> 00:29:10.550 align:middle line:84%
And then it's, you know, it's
a dark filter that's coming.

00:29:10.550 --> 00:29:17.030 align:middle line:84%
And so I would say it's a
tremendous spiritual challenge

00:29:17.030 --> 00:29:18.095 align:middle line:90%
for people today.

00:29:18.095 --> 00:29:19.220 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Oh, very much so.

00:29:19.220 --> 00:29:21.620 align:middle line:84%
And it's a very big emotional
and mental challenge,

00:29:21.620 --> 00:29:23.990 align:middle line:84%
because you're watching
a site that's saying,

00:29:23.990 --> 00:29:26.055 align:middle line:84%
oh no, this is
actually really good.

00:29:26.055 --> 00:29:28.430 align:middle line:84%
It could look kind of ugly,
but it's really, really good.

00:29:28.430 --> 00:29:29.960 align:middle line:90%
And you're thinking, no.

00:29:29.960 --> 00:29:30.880 align:middle line:90%
It looks really ugly.

00:29:30.880 --> 00:29:33.590 align:middle line:84%
I'm not seeing anything
good in this at all.

00:29:33.590 --> 00:29:37.010 align:middle line:84%
And I'm not seeing anything
they ever say ever being true.

00:29:37.010 --> 00:29:38.660 align:middle line:84%
But it has this
addictive quality

00:29:38.660 --> 00:29:41.390 align:middle line:84%
to feed the expectation
of the person that's

00:29:41.390 --> 00:29:43.280 align:middle line:84%
addicted to that kind
of information now.

00:29:43.280 --> 00:29:44.080 align:middle line:90%
>>CARL: Yeah.

00:29:44.080 --> 00:29:46.640 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And to me I
watch it and I think,

00:29:46.640 --> 00:29:48.375 align:middle line:90%
this is a really slippery slope.

00:29:48.375 --> 00:29:52.250 align:middle line:84%
But maybe that's just
endemic historically

00:29:52.250 --> 00:29:54.050 align:middle line:90%
to the time we're in.

00:29:54.050 --> 00:29:57.333 align:middle line:84%
And so we'll get to the
fixes on this a little bit

00:29:57.333 --> 00:29:59.750 align:middle line:84%
later, because it's important
to talk about the solutions.

00:29:59.750 --> 00:30:02.710 align:middle line:84%
Because there is a place
to go for discernment.

00:30:02.710 --> 00:30:04.860 align:middle line:84%
For truth amidst
all of this, right?

00:30:04.860 --> 00:30:05.660 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:30:05.660 --> 00:30:08.180 align:middle line:84%
And part of this is
really interesting.

00:30:08.180 --> 00:30:09.800 align:middle line:84%
You wrote, you
explained, that this

00:30:09.800 --> 00:30:14.240 align:middle line:84%
is kind of Yahweh way
versus the serpent

00:30:14.240 --> 00:30:17.390 align:middle line:84%
is what really came up in
this wave of consciousness,

00:30:17.390 --> 00:30:19.440 align:middle line:90%
sixth kind of patriarchal wave.

00:30:19.440 --> 00:30:21.230 align:middle line:90%
Yahweh versus the serpent.

00:30:21.230 --> 00:30:23.745 align:middle line:90%
What does that mean?

00:30:23.745 --> 00:30:28.250 align:middle line:84%
And I think I wrote here,
in the book of Genesis,

00:30:28.250 --> 00:30:31.250 align:middle line:84%
it says in here is
the reversal of truth.

00:30:31.250 --> 00:30:32.740 align:middle line:90%
So let's talk about that.

00:30:32.740 --> 00:30:33.990 align:middle line:90%
I think it's really important.

00:30:33.990 --> 00:30:36.290 align:middle line:84%
So many are part of the
Judeo Christian culture.

00:30:36.290 --> 00:30:38.640 align:middle line:84%
>>CARL: It's very
important, I think.

00:30:38.640 --> 00:30:40.430 align:middle line:84%
You know, we talked
earlier about

00:30:40.430 --> 00:30:43.550 align:middle line:84%
how pretty much all the
traditions of the world

00:30:43.550 --> 00:30:46.310 align:middle line:84%
have this idea of a Tree
of Life and some kind

00:30:46.310 --> 00:30:47.480 align:middle line:90%
of a serpent to it.

00:30:47.480 --> 00:30:51.710 align:middle line:90%


00:30:51.710 --> 00:30:53.900 align:middle line:84%
And everybody has
probably heard,

00:30:53.900 --> 00:30:56.310 align:middle line:84%
at least if you live
in the Western world,

00:30:56.310 --> 00:31:00.770 align:middle line:84%
you've heard the book of
Genesis version about this.

00:31:00.770 --> 00:31:01.580 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:31:01.580 --> 00:31:04.340 align:middle line:84%
Highly conflicting information,
chapter to chapter.

00:31:04.340 --> 00:31:05.180 align:middle line:90%
>>CARL: Yeah.

00:31:05.180 --> 00:31:06.160 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:31:06.160 --> 00:31:09.200 align:middle line:90%
That's true, too.

00:31:09.200 --> 00:31:18.050 align:middle line:84%
But basically, then, it ends up
with the god, or purported god

00:31:18.050 --> 00:31:21.350 align:middle line:90%
maybe, of the Jews.

00:31:21.350 --> 00:31:27.350 align:middle line:84%
He curses the human
beings, and especially Eve,

00:31:27.350 --> 00:31:30.500 align:middle line:90%
but he also curses the serpent.

00:31:30.500 --> 00:31:34.310 align:middle line:84%
Because the serpent has
brought this knowledge

00:31:34.310 --> 00:31:39.290 align:middle line:84%
of good and evil,
and that wasn't good

00:31:39.290 --> 00:31:41.900 align:middle line:90%
according to Yahweh.

00:31:41.900 --> 00:31:44.360 align:middle line:84%
And the first thing
to notice, I think,

00:31:44.360 --> 00:31:48.530 align:middle line:84%
is that this is kind of unique
in the ancient traditions,

00:31:48.530 --> 00:31:52.490 align:middle line:84%
that the serpent is being
repressed like this.

00:31:52.490 --> 00:31:54.740 align:middle line:84%
Usually they would
honor the serpent

00:31:54.740 --> 00:31:58.890 align:middle line:84%
as being a bringer of some
information, and so forth.

00:31:58.890 --> 00:32:01.230 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: But then you have
to get into who is Yahweh?

00:32:01.230 --> 00:32:02.480 align:middle line:90%
Who are the gods of the day?

00:32:02.480 --> 00:32:05.108 align:middle line:84%
Get into-- I love Chris Hardy's
work, for example, and how

00:32:05.108 --> 00:32:06.650 align:middle line:84%
she explains it,
where you're getting

00:32:06.650 --> 00:32:09.350 align:middle line:84%
into some of the
Anunnaki influence

00:32:09.350 --> 00:32:12.550 align:middle line:84%
and men setting themselves
up as the god in residence.

00:32:12.550 --> 00:32:13.350 align:middle line:90%
>>CARL: Yeah.

00:32:13.350 --> 00:32:14.150 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:32:14.150 --> 00:32:16.100 align:middle line:84%
So that's different
than natural waves.

00:32:16.100 --> 00:32:17.240 align:middle line:90%
>>CARL: Yeah, it is.

00:32:17.240 --> 00:32:18.040 align:middle line:90%
It is.

00:32:18.040 --> 00:32:20.870 align:middle line:90%
So I think this was sort of--

00:32:20.870 --> 00:32:24.700 align:middle line:84%
that god was like a projection
of the human ego that

00:32:24.700 --> 00:32:28.160 align:middle line:90%
started to emerge at that time.

00:32:28.160 --> 00:32:30.020 align:middle line:90%
Yahweh is a jealous god.

00:32:30.020 --> 00:32:31.940 align:middle line:90%
He doesn't accept anybody else.

00:32:31.940 --> 00:32:35.180 align:middle line:90%
It's sort of typical of the ego.

00:32:35.180 --> 00:32:37.340 align:middle line:84%
And so what happens
in human society

00:32:37.340 --> 00:32:41.270 align:middle line:84%
at that time, which is sort
of being let legitimized

00:32:41.270 --> 00:32:46.650 align:middle line:84%
by this story, is that the ego
becomes the driver very much,

00:32:46.650 --> 00:32:51.470 align:middle line:84%
and people start to ignore the
wave movement and so forth.

00:32:51.470 --> 00:32:53.770 align:middle line:90%
And I think the idea is false.

00:32:53.770 --> 00:32:56.030 align:middle line:84%
I don't think that's
how things are.

00:32:56.030 --> 00:32:58.820 align:middle line:84%
Because if you actually
look at history, even

00:32:58.820 --> 00:33:02.210 align:middle line:84%
from that point of
time, 2,500 years,

00:33:02.210 --> 00:33:04.380 align:middle line:84%
it will continue
to go like a wave.

00:33:04.380 --> 00:33:09.440 align:middle line:84%
Like the serpent is
still there, but they

00:33:09.440 --> 00:33:12.800 align:middle line:84%
try to make it a human
thing, so to speak.

00:33:12.800 --> 00:33:15.950 align:middle line:84%
And the shift then
came from the earlier,

00:33:15.950 --> 00:33:20.150 align:middle line:84%
maybe more tuning
into the waves,

00:33:20.150 --> 00:33:24.550 align:middle line:84%
and then went to being
the ego sort of thing.

00:33:24.550 --> 00:33:26.060 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: The big ego.

00:33:26.060 --> 00:33:28.820 align:middle line:84%
So now let's move
on, because I'm

00:33:28.820 --> 00:33:30.250 align:middle line:90%
interested in the ninth wave.

00:33:30.250 --> 00:33:31.560 align:middle line:84%
So we've got to get
through the seventh wave

00:33:31.560 --> 00:33:32.270 align:middle line:90%
and the eighth wave.

00:33:32.270 --> 00:33:32.390 align:middle line:90%
>>CARL: Yeah.

00:33:32.390 --> 00:33:33.190 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:33:33.190 --> 00:33:37.970 align:middle line:84%
So the seventh wave was
activated in AD 1755.

00:33:37.970 --> 00:33:44.030 align:middle line:84%
And it's also a time of great
changes in human society.

00:33:44.030 --> 00:33:47.120 align:middle line:84%
For the first time
you have republics

00:33:47.120 --> 00:33:49.940 align:middle line:84%
being formed in the
United States and France,

00:33:49.940 --> 00:33:54.000 align:middle line:84%
the revolutions in those
countries, and so forth.

00:33:54.000 --> 00:33:57.170 align:middle line:84%
And so over time,
republics have come

00:33:57.170 --> 00:34:01.100 align:middle line:84%
to replace all the monarchies
that were totally the norm

00:34:01.100 --> 00:34:03.590 align:middle line:90%
before 1755.

00:34:03.590 --> 00:34:05.900 align:middle line:84%
And then it's the
Industrial Revolution.

00:34:05.900 --> 00:34:10.250 align:middle line:84%
Before that, people really
couldn't use any fossil sources

00:34:10.250 --> 00:34:11.909 align:middle line:90%
of energy.

00:34:11.909 --> 00:34:16.159 align:middle line:84%
But then 1769 with the
invention of the steam engine--

00:34:16.159 --> 00:34:17.989 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Coal and then
on to fossil fuels.

00:34:17.989 --> 00:34:21.560 align:middle line:84%
>>CARL: Onto trains and
cars and electricity,

00:34:21.560 --> 00:34:24.520 align:middle line:90%
and all that kind of a thing.

00:34:24.520 --> 00:34:28.100 align:middle line:90%
But it's also actually people--

00:34:28.100 --> 00:34:32.840 align:middle line:84%
it's creating a little
bit of balance in this.

00:34:32.840 --> 00:34:37.610 align:middle line:84%
We talked about the duality that
had dominated the sixth wave.

00:34:37.610 --> 00:34:39.050 align:middle line:90%
It became that.

00:34:39.050 --> 00:34:42.290 align:middle line:84%
And so it's only after
this point in time,

00:34:42.290 --> 00:34:46.610 align:middle line:84%
actually, that people start
to protest against slavery.

00:34:46.610 --> 00:34:49.070 align:middle line:90%
Before that, nobody really did.

00:34:49.070 --> 00:34:53.929 align:middle line:84%
But then you get this sense
that in many ways you start--

00:34:53.929 --> 00:34:56.719 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So the Industrial
Revolution, in a sense,

00:34:56.719 --> 00:34:59.260 align:middle line:90%
created an equalizing effect.

00:34:59.260 --> 00:35:00.140 align:middle line:90%
In a sense.

00:35:00.140 --> 00:35:02.460 align:middle line:84%
Even though a lot of people
were enslaved to that.

00:35:02.460 --> 00:35:03.270 align:middle line:90%
>>CARL: Yes.

00:35:03.270 --> 00:35:03.890 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

00:35:03.890 --> 00:35:04.790 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:35:04.790 --> 00:35:07.040 align:middle line:90%
Everything is sort of complex.

00:35:07.040 --> 00:35:09.350 align:middle line:84%
But I think it's still
true that people--

00:35:09.350 --> 00:35:13.120 align:middle line:84%
you know, before
this point in time,

00:35:13.120 --> 00:35:14.750 align:middle line:90%
people were very, very cruel.

00:35:14.750 --> 00:35:19.530 align:middle line:84%
And it's tremendous-- you know,
torture was sort of normal.

00:35:19.530 --> 00:35:22.200 align:middle line:90%
It was what do you do.

00:35:22.200 --> 00:35:24.270 align:middle line:84%
Because the duality
told you this

00:35:24.270 --> 00:35:28.505 align:middle line:84%
comes from some high place
up there, and so they just--

00:35:28.505 --> 00:35:29.880 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Horrid
what people have

00:35:29.880 --> 00:35:31.963 align:middle line:84%
done in the name of their
gods throughout history.

00:35:31.963 --> 00:35:33.070 align:middle line:90%
>>CARL: That, too.

00:35:33.070 --> 00:35:33.870 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:35:33.870 --> 00:35:36.090 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So the
seventh wave, then when

00:35:36.090 --> 00:35:39.000 align:middle line:84%
did that start turning down
and beginning of the eighth?

00:35:39.000 --> 00:35:41.460 align:middle line:90%
>>CARL: It goes up and down.

00:35:41.460 --> 00:35:45.090 align:middle line:84%
20 years basically
up-- it's 20 times

00:35:45.090 --> 00:35:48.390 align:middle line:84%
higher frequencies
going like that.

00:35:48.390 --> 00:35:56.130 align:middle line:84%
And then comes the eighth
wave, and that's in 1999.

00:35:56.130 --> 00:35:59.340 align:middle line:84%
And that basically,
well it brings a couple

00:35:59.340 --> 00:36:01.980 align:middle line:90%
of different phenomena.

00:36:01.980 --> 00:36:09.350 align:middle line:84%
Maybe the most remarkable
is the Digital Revolution.

00:36:09.350 --> 00:36:13.700 align:middle line:84%
So now we are living in a
digital world, pretty much.

00:36:13.700 --> 00:36:18.770 align:middle line:84%
And in the ancient times,
people would talk, say

00:36:18.770 --> 00:36:23.330 align:middle line:84%
that there were different worlds
sort of replacing each other.

00:36:23.330 --> 00:36:27.740 align:middle line:84%
And if you want an example
of how we're in a new world,

00:36:27.740 --> 00:36:32.000 align:middle line:84%
I think the digital world
really makes a good case.

00:36:32.000 --> 00:36:32.900 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Absolutely.

00:36:32.900 --> 00:36:35.280 align:middle line:84%
It's almost an alternate
reality and portal.

00:36:35.280 --> 00:36:36.080 align:middle line:90%
>>CARL: Yes.

00:36:36.080 --> 00:36:38.530 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So here we have
the Digital Revolution.

00:36:38.530 --> 00:36:40.670 align:middle line:84%
I think everyone can
understand the feelings of all

00:36:40.670 --> 00:36:42.330 align:middle line:90%
these waves we've talked about.

00:36:42.330 --> 00:36:45.860 align:middle line:84%
And what's interesting
is just because one wave

00:36:45.860 --> 00:36:47.420 align:middle line:84%
gives way to another
does not mean

00:36:47.420 --> 00:36:49.490 align:middle line:84%
that the imprint of
the previous waves

00:36:49.490 --> 00:36:52.140 align:middle line:84%
isn't influencing us, our
bodies, our development,

00:36:52.140 --> 00:36:53.330 align:middle line:90%
our societies.

00:36:53.330 --> 00:36:54.460 align:middle line:90%
They can all be present.

00:36:54.460 --> 00:36:55.260 align:middle line:90%
>>CARL: Yeah.

00:36:55.260 --> 00:36:56.130 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: OK.

00:36:56.130 --> 00:36:57.450 align:middle line:90%
Now we go to the ninth wave.

00:36:57.450 --> 00:36:58.250 align:middle line:90%
>>CARL: Yeah.

00:36:58.250 --> 00:37:02.250 align:middle line:84%
So the ninth wave was
activated in 2011.

00:37:02.250 --> 00:37:06.680 align:middle line:84%
That is the highest, as
far as we can understand

00:37:06.680 --> 00:37:08.510 align:middle line:90%
it, the highest of the waves.

00:37:08.510 --> 00:37:13.490 align:middle line:84%
And that's-- it's quite
distinct, different,

00:37:13.490 --> 00:37:14.490 align:middle line:90%
I would say.

00:37:14.490 --> 00:37:19.580 align:middle line:84%
In a sense, it has a
similar quantum state

00:37:19.580 --> 00:37:24.020 align:middle line:84%
as the fifth wave that brought
the first spirituality,

00:37:24.020 --> 00:37:26.850 align:middle line:90%
the first art, and so forth.

00:37:26.850 --> 00:37:32.780 align:middle line:84%
But most importantly,
it's a quantum state--

00:37:32.780 --> 00:37:36.360 align:middle line:84%
that wave carries
a quantum state

00:37:36.360 --> 00:37:38.730 align:middle line:90%
that doesn't create separation.

00:37:38.730 --> 00:37:44.170 align:middle line:84%
There is no duality
in it, so to speak.

00:37:44.170 --> 00:37:48.530 align:middle line:84%
And what that means
is that we could,

00:37:48.530 --> 00:37:51.770 align:middle line:84%
through developing
resonance with this,

00:37:51.770 --> 00:37:56.870 align:middle line:84%
we could go back to
relating differently.

00:37:56.870 --> 00:38:03.860 align:middle line:84%
Not that good/bad, black/white
that people normally

00:38:03.860 --> 00:38:05.700 align:middle line:90%
thought in the sixth wave.

00:38:05.700 --> 00:38:10.340 align:middle line:84%
It's one that doesn't
create separation, really.

00:38:10.340 --> 00:38:19.880 align:middle line:84%
And I would say a "we-ness"
state of consciousness.

00:38:19.880 --> 00:38:25.790 align:middle line:84%
And it won't have those
kind of clear manifestations

00:38:25.790 --> 00:38:30.080 align:middle line:84%
like the Industrial Revolution
and the Digital Revolution,

00:38:30.080 --> 00:38:33.410 align:middle line:84%
because as I
understand it, whoever

00:38:33.410 --> 00:38:37.730 align:middle line:84%
planned this cosmic plan,
it's for us an opportunity

00:38:37.730 --> 00:38:42.530 align:middle line:84%
to go back to that unity
that we came from in a sense.

00:38:42.530 --> 00:38:46.010 align:middle line:84%
And it's not really
about technology.

00:38:46.010 --> 00:38:48.380 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And we see
some evidence of this.

00:38:48.380 --> 00:38:50.460 align:middle line:90%
I mean, as is crazy--

00:38:50.460 --> 00:38:53.730 align:middle line:84%
it's kind of crazy making out
there, but I agree with you--

00:38:53.730 --> 00:38:56.360 align:middle line:84%
we've actually never
been a kinder species.

00:38:56.360 --> 00:38:58.700 align:middle line:84%
Compared to where we came
from, where literally

00:38:58.700 --> 00:39:03.030 align:middle line:84%
people would go and watch
horrible executions for fun

00:39:03.030 --> 00:39:03.830 align:middle line:90%
on the weekend.

00:39:03.830 --> 00:39:06.440 align:middle line:84%
They'd schedule an
execution essentially

00:39:06.440 --> 00:39:07.650 align:middle line:90%
for town entertainment.

00:39:07.650 --> 00:39:11.610 align:middle line:84%
I mean, we were so barbaric
such a short time ago.

00:39:11.610 --> 00:39:12.740 align:middle line:90%
We've come a long way.

00:39:12.740 --> 00:39:16.100 align:middle line:84%
And as you say, since
2011 with this ninth wave

00:39:16.100 --> 00:39:17.270 align:middle line:90%
it's interesting.

00:39:17.270 --> 00:39:20.240 align:middle line:84%
Because we've certainly
seen a polarization

00:39:20.240 --> 00:39:23.300 align:middle line:84%
in the wealth of people
and the status of people,

00:39:23.300 --> 00:39:26.870 align:middle line:84%
as the wealthier literally
garnered virtually everything

00:39:26.870 --> 00:39:29.810 align:middle line:84%
for themselves and then the
rest of society gets the scraps

00:39:29.810 --> 00:39:31.490 align:middle line:90%
and is left to survive.

00:39:31.490 --> 00:39:35.180 align:middle line:84%
That kind of concentration of
wealth has never been greater,

00:39:35.180 --> 00:39:36.050 align:middle line:90%
I don't know think.

00:39:36.050 --> 00:39:39.050 align:middle line:84%
Well, maybe in the time of
fiefdoms and kingdoms and such.

00:39:39.050 --> 00:39:41.640 align:middle line:84%
But not in modern history
as it is right now.

00:39:41.640 --> 00:39:45.450 align:middle line:84%
So we have this incredible
tearing away on one hand.

00:39:45.450 --> 00:39:49.807 align:middle line:84%
But just as unions
came about however--

00:39:49.807 --> 00:39:51.890 align:middle line:84%
I don't know when the first
union was established,

00:39:51.890 --> 00:39:56.090 align:middle line:84%
but let's say 75 years
ago, 100 years ago.

00:39:56.090 --> 00:39:58.490 align:middle line:84%
I don't know the history
of union organization.

00:39:58.490 --> 00:40:00.920 align:middle line:84%
And it gave some
protection to the workers

00:40:00.920 --> 00:40:03.440 align:middle line:84%
against the abuses
of the bosses who

00:40:03.440 --> 00:40:05.930 align:middle line:90%
wanted to crank product out.

00:40:05.930 --> 00:40:09.710 align:middle line:84%
That was done in a formal
way to give an average worker

00:40:09.710 --> 00:40:12.740 align:middle line:84%
a bit of a dignified life
instead of being worked

00:40:12.740 --> 00:40:14.690 align:middle line:90%
to death by the age of 29.

00:40:14.690 --> 00:40:16.890 align:middle line:84%
That was the beginning
of it on one level.

00:40:16.890 --> 00:40:19.440 align:middle line:84%
Then you had the
emancipation of women.

00:40:19.440 --> 00:40:22.340 align:middle line:84%
You had the rights of
all people to vote.

00:40:22.340 --> 00:40:24.140 align:middle line:90%
I mean, so it's been building.

00:40:24.140 --> 00:40:26.300 align:middle line:84%
But now what's so
beautiful, it seems

00:40:26.300 --> 00:40:31.010 align:middle line:84%
to be driven from something
deeper in ourselves really

00:40:31.010 --> 00:40:33.000 align:middle line:90%
even from the heart.

00:40:33.000 --> 00:40:36.110 align:middle line:84%
This is really catching
that divine wave.

00:40:36.110 --> 00:40:37.370 align:middle line:90%
>>CARL: Yeah.

00:40:37.370 --> 00:40:38.900 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: In the truest
sense of what it's here for.

00:40:38.900 --> 00:40:39.440 align:middle line:90%
>>CARL: Sure.

00:40:39.440 --> 00:40:40.020 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:40:40.020 --> 00:40:40.820 align:middle line:90%
Absolutely.

00:40:40.820 --> 00:40:43.520 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So with
people kind of going--

00:40:43.520 --> 00:40:48.230 align:middle line:84%
if you're not catching that
wave yet, to me I look at--

00:40:48.230 --> 00:40:50.870 align:middle line:84%
and I said this in
another show recently.

00:40:50.870 --> 00:40:52.970 align:middle line:90%
We can't look to--

00:40:52.970 --> 00:40:54.110 align:middle line:90%
I love truth.

00:40:54.110 --> 00:40:55.730 align:middle line:90%
I'm always looking for it.

00:40:55.730 --> 00:40:57.470 align:middle line:84%
But truth is so
highly subjective

00:40:57.470 --> 00:40:59.930 align:middle line:84%
right now, and through
everyone's own lens.

00:40:59.930 --> 00:41:03.980 align:middle line:84%
It's really-- you almost can't
use that word very easily.

00:41:03.980 --> 00:41:05.600 align:middle line:90%
But you can go into the heart.

00:41:05.600 --> 00:41:08.880 align:middle line:84%
You can go into what you
know to be right and true.

00:41:08.880 --> 00:41:09.680 align:middle line:90%
Right?

00:41:09.680 --> 00:41:10.480 align:middle line:90%
>>CARL: Yeah.

00:41:10.480 --> 00:41:12.740 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And so this
compartmentalization

00:41:12.740 --> 00:41:15.050 align:middle line:84%
that has been going on, this
is what you write about,

00:41:15.050 --> 00:41:18.260 align:middle line:84%
is how to begin deep
compartmentalizing so that we

00:41:18.260 --> 00:41:20.450 align:middle line:84%
can access the deeper
truths in ourself

00:41:20.450 --> 00:41:24.290 align:middle line:84%
to know what's truly a good
offering into the world.

00:41:24.290 --> 00:41:26.460 align:middle line:84%
And where to put
our time and energy.

00:41:26.460 --> 00:41:28.250 align:middle line:90%
So talk about that--

00:41:28.250 --> 00:41:29.490 align:middle line:90%
decompartmentalization.

00:41:29.490 --> 00:41:30.290 align:middle line:90%
>>CARL: Yeah.

00:41:30.290 --> 00:41:36.740 align:middle line:84%
Well, the first thing, though,
is that these nine waves,

00:41:36.740 --> 00:41:38.940 align:middle line:84%
they are now
running in parallel.

00:41:38.940 --> 00:41:39.740 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:41:39.740 --> 00:41:43.490 align:middle line:84%
And you can dip up, down,
in, and out of any of them.

00:41:43.490 --> 00:41:44.460 align:middle line:90%
>>CARL: Yes.

00:41:44.460 --> 00:41:50.790 align:middle line:84%
And different people are
resonating with different waves

00:41:50.790 --> 00:41:53.040 align:middle line:90%
to different degrees.

00:41:53.040 --> 00:41:57.880 align:middle line:84%
Some people may even be still
very much in the sixth wave,

00:41:57.880 --> 00:41:58.845 align:middle line:90%
and others maybe--

00:41:58.845 --> 00:42:00.570 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Well,
if it served them,

00:42:00.570 --> 00:42:02.580 align:middle line:84%
clinging to the remnants
of what served them.

00:42:02.580 --> 00:42:04.630 align:middle line:90%
>>CARL: That seems to be it.

00:42:04.630 --> 00:42:09.030 align:middle line:84%
And so what this means is
that it's not just these--

00:42:09.030 --> 00:42:12.000 align:middle line:84%
what's happening now in
the world and will happen

00:42:12.000 --> 00:42:15.630 align:middle line:84%
may not necessarily come
sort of across the board.

00:42:15.630 --> 00:42:17.730 align:middle line:84%
There might be some
people that are

00:42:17.730 --> 00:42:21.190 align:middle line:84%
seeing the world through
another filter, basically.

00:42:21.190 --> 00:42:23.880 align:middle line:90%


00:42:23.880 --> 00:42:28.380 align:middle line:84%
But it also points, then,
to us to some extent,

00:42:28.380 --> 00:42:32.490 align:middle line:84%
and I think the intentions that
we have are critical for this,

00:42:32.490 --> 00:42:37.950 align:middle line:84%
to what do we want to
develop resonance with?

00:42:37.950 --> 00:42:40.980 align:middle line:84%
And then I also want
to point out here

00:42:40.980 --> 00:42:47.430 align:middle line:84%
that these are actually
quantum states that are

00:42:47.430 --> 00:42:49.920 align:middle line:90%
emitted from the cosmic center.

00:42:49.920 --> 00:42:54.060 align:middle line:84%
And we don't sort
of just smoothly

00:42:54.060 --> 00:42:55.240 align:middle line:90%
go from one to another.

00:42:55.240 --> 00:42:56.040 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:42:56.040 --> 00:42:56.840 align:middle line:90%
Right.

00:42:56.840 --> 00:42:58.480 align:middle line:84%
There are always
stutters and problems.

00:42:58.480 --> 00:42:59.550 align:middle line:90%
>>CARL: Yeah.

00:42:59.550 --> 00:43:03.810 align:middle line:84%
And especially that
last quantum shift,

00:43:03.810 --> 00:43:05.500 align:middle line:84%
I would say, up
to the ninth wave.

00:43:05.500 --> 00:43:06.750 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Going from me to we.

00:43:06.750 --> 00:43:07.550 align:middle line:90%
>>CARL: Yeah.

00:43:07.550 --> 00:43:11.130 align:middle line:84%
That's-- it doesn't
happen automatically.

00:43:11.130 --> 00:43:16.050 align:middle line:84%
Because we will-- we, I don't
know if it's true for me,

00:43:16.050 --> 00:43:20.130 align:middle line:84%
but most people will still
ask the question, what's in it

00:43:20.130 --> 00:43:22.650 align:middle line:90%
for me, so to speak.

00:43:22.650 --> 00:43:25.083 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Not a good
question in that wave.

00:43:25.083 --> 00:43:27.000 align:middle line:84%
>>CARL: It's not a good
question in that wave,

00:43:27.000 --> 00:43:28.290 align:middle line:90%
because you don't--

00:43:28.290 --> 00:43:31.920 align:middle line:84%
if that's your
primary question, you

00:43:31.920 --> 00:43:35.280 align:middle line:84%
may not take that quantum
leap to the highest level.

00:43:35.280 --> 00:43:38.190 align:middle line:90%
So I would say it creates--

00:43:38.190 --> 00:43:42.930 align:middle line:84%
it requires an intention
and also then an intention

00:43:42.930 --> 00:43:45.300 align:middle line:90%
to do a quantum leap.

00:43:45.300 --> 00:43:47.790 align:middle line:84%
And what a quantum
leap means here

00:43:47.790 --> 00:43:52.430 align:middle line:84%
is that you may not
have the immediate--

00:43:52.430 --> 00:43:55.590 align:middle line:84%
on the state of
consciousness where you are,

00:43:55.590 --> 00:44:00.750 align:middle line:84%
you may not see this
other quantum state.

00:44:00.750 --> 00:44:02.850 align:middle line:84%
It's almost like I'll
have to take the risk

00:44:02.850 --> 00:44:04.840 align:middle line:90%
in this particular case.

00:44:04.840 --> 00:44:10.320 align:middle line:84%
And then start to
cultivate your resonance

00:44:10.320 --> 00:44:13.195 align:middle line:90%
with that particular wave.

00:44:13.195 --> 00:44:14.070 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Absolutely.

00:44:14.070 --> 00:44:15.640 align:middle line:90%
Because it has to be a choice.

00:44:15.640 --> 00:44:19.200 align:middle line:84%
There has to be a recognition
that this is beneficial,

00:44:19.200 --> 00:44:21.930 align:middle line:84%
to be inclusive
rather than exclusive.

00:44:21.930 --> 00:44:24.840 align:middle line:84%
To be respectful to someone
else who is different rather

00:44:24.840 --> 00:44:26.235 align:middle line:90%
than disrespectful.

00:44:26.235 --> 00:44:30.840 align:middle line:84%
A person has to have some
kind of feeling for going

00:44:30.840 --> 00:44:32.340 align:middle line:90%
in a new direction, right?

00:44:32.340 --> 00:44:33.940 align:middle line:84%
There has to be
some impetus for it.

00:44:33.940 --> 00:44:35.810 align:middle line:84%
Maybe watching someone
being humiliated

00:44:35.810 --> 00:44:38.920 align:middle line:84%
and it hurt your soul so badly
you just can't take it anymore

00:44:38.920 --> 00:44:40.400 align:middle line:90%
and you have to stand up for it.

00:44:40.400 --> 00:44:41.210 align:middle line:90%
Right?

00:44:41.210 --> 00:44:42.720 align:middle line:84%
I mean, that's what's
happening right now.

00:44:42.720 --> 00:44:43.590 align:middle line:90%
>>CARL: Yeah, it is.

00:44:43.590 --> 00:44:47.070 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So in
your book, you write

00:44:47.070 --> 00:44:49.150 align:middle line:90%
about decompartmentalization.

00:44:49.150 --> 00:44:53.040 align:middle line:84%
Even the use of
psychedelics in instances

00:44:53.040 --> 00:44:56.050 align:middle line:90%
to blow those boundaries apart.

00:44:56.050 --> 00:44:56.850 align:middle line:90%
>>CARL: Yes.

00:44:56.850 --> 00:44:58.620 align:middle line:84%
The way I look upon
it, and I think

00:44:58.620 --> 00:45:02.310 align:middle line:84%
I made a good case
that that's so,

00:45:02.310 --> 00:45:05.580 align:middle line:84%
is that we download
these quantum states

00:45:05.580 --> 00:45:07.950 align:middle line:90%
from the cosmic center.

00:45:07.950 --> 00:45:12.990 align:middle line:84%
And what that means is that we
download a particular geometry

00:45:12.990 --> 00:45:18.240 align:middle line:84%
and duality through which
we perceive reality.

00:45:18.240 --> 00:45:23.370 align:middle line:84%
And especially this sixth
wave that created civilization

00:45:23.370 --> 00:45:28.780 align:middle line:84%
5,100 years ago, it was a very
compartmentalizing geometry,

00:45:28.780 --> 00:45:29.910 align:middle line:90%
so to speak.

00:45:29.910 --> 00:45:33.210 align:middle line:84%
And in certain ways,
that's kind of--

00:45:33.210 --> 00:45:37.110 align:middle line:84%
you know, it's based
on perpendicular

00:45:37.110 --> 00:45:39.840 align:middle line:90%
structuring of our minds.

00:45:39.840 --> 00:45:43.170 align:middle line:84%
So for instance,
writing came out

00:45:43.170 --> 00:45:45.750 align:middle line:84%
of that particular--
the ability to write.

00:45:45.750 --> 00:45:47.460 align:middle line:90%
Because what is writing?

00:45:47.460 --> 00:45:51.960 align:middle line:84%
Well, it's signs, but it's
signs placed in a horizontal

00:45:51.960 --> 00:45:53.700 align:middle line:90%
or a vertical context.

00:45:53.700 --> 00:45:57.210 align:middle line:84%
And if you don't have that
context, you have no writing.

00:45:57.210 --> 00:46:00.630 align:middle line:84%
So before people started
to download this geometry,

00:46:00.630 --> 00:46:02.250 align:middle line:90%
they didn't write.

00:46:02.250 --> 00:46:04.200 align:middle line:90%
That wasn't part of it.

00:46:04.200 --> 00:46:11.700 align:middle line:84%
Now, that also, that geometry
creates a compartmentalization

00:46:11.700 --> 00:46:13.770 align:middle line:90%
of our brains.

00:46:13.770 --> 00:46:16.170 align:middle line:84%
And if you like,
most of these things

00:46:16.170 --> 00:46:19.500 align:middle line:84%
you can always see a good side
or a bad side, a little bad.

00:46:19.500 --> 00:46:22.580 align:middle line:84%
It's not as simple to
say that that's a bad way

00:46:22.580 --> 00:46:24.980 align:middle line:84%
or that's a good way
or something like that.

00:46:24.980 --> 00:46:29.850 align:middle line:84%
But there's many aspects
of them to be aware of.

00:46:29.850 --> 00:46:33.420 align:middle line:84%
And it's created
compartmentalization.

00:46:33.420 --> 00:46:36.390 align:middle line:84%
And that compartmentalization
was, for instance, also

00:46:36.390 --> 00:46:44.050 align:middle line:84%
linked to this duality, this
hierarchical differences that

00:46:44.050 --> 00:46:47.150 align:middle line:84%
ruled the world for
such a long time.

00:46:47.150 --> 00:46:53.080 align:middle line:84%
And now psychedelics come
in here, as well as--

00:46:53.080 --> 00:46:56.350 align:middle line:84%
I think one of the points
that I'm making really

00:46:56.350 --> 00:46:59.380 align:middle line:84%
in this book and the
explanation that I provide

00:46:59.380 --> 00:47:04.690 align:middle line:84%
for how psychedelics work
is that it's not really

00:47:04.690 --> 00:47:10.600 align:middle line:84%
like psychedelics is drugs and
meditation is good so to speak.

00:47:10.600 --> 00:47:11.400 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:47:11.400 --> 00:47:12.200 align:middle line:90%
>>CARL: No.

00:47:12.200 --> 00:47:15.940 align:middle line:84%
I look upon these
different phenomena--

00:47:15.940 --> 00:47:17.695 align:middle line:90%
breath work--

00:47:17.695 --> 00:47:18.570 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Meditation.

00:47:18.570 --> 00:47:19.270 align:middle line:90%
>>CARL: Meditation.

00:47:19.270 --> 00:47:20.800 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: You can
even bring in EMDR.

00:47:20.800 --> 00:47:22.480 align:middle line:84%
I mean, there are a
lot of different ways

00:47:22.480 --> 00:47:24.370 align:middle line:84%
to break these
compartmentalization patterns.

00:47:24.370 --> 00:47:25.420 align:middle line:90%
>>CARL: Exactly.

00:47:25.420 --> 00:47:29.020 align:middle line:84%
And I look upon it as
a variation of a theme.

00:47:29.020 --> 00:47:31.720 align:middle line:84%
And they function a
little bit differently,

00:47:31.720 --> 00:47:36.160 align:middle line:84%
but that's the central
of, I would say,

00:47:36.160 --> 00:47:37.760 align:middle line:90%
the healing aspect of it.

00:47:37.760 --> 00:47:42.460 align:middle line:84%
It helps us move towards
unity, I would say.

00:47:42.460 --> 00:47:45.550 align:middle line:84%
Because if you take the
case of psychedelics,

00:47:45.550 --> 00:47:48.220 align:middle line:84%
at least temporarily
for a couple of hours

00:47:48.220 --> 00:47:51.250 align:middle line:84%
it breaks down that
compartmentalization

00:47:51.250 --> 00:47:54.280 align:middle line:84%
and you get information
through the waves that

00:47:54.280 --> 00:47:59.500 align:middle line:84%
are not sort of separated
or focused in the way

00:47:59.500 --> 00:48:01.222 align:middle line:90%
that they used to be.

00:48:01.222 --> 00:48:03.430 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Because your
brain's experiencing literally

00:48:03.430 --> 00:48:08.470 align:middle line:84%
different brain wave states
than in your normal waking life.

00:48:08.470 --> 00:48:11.980 align:middle line:84%
So you're able to access these
other fields of consciousness

00:48:11.980 --> 00:48:13.770 align:middle line:84%
and tap into that
brainwave pattern.

00:48:13.770 --> 00:48:14.950 align:middle line:90%
>>CARL: Right.

00:48:14.950 --> 00:48:18.880 align:middle line:84%
You know, you go out of
your default state, which

00:48:18.880 --> 00:48:22.040 align:middle line:90%
is usually very structured.

00:48:22.040 --> 00:48:23.590 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Your identity.

00:48:23.590 --> 00:48:24.730 align:middle line:90%
>>CARL: Yeah.

00:48:24.730 --> 00:48:28.900 align:middle line:84%
Very much so, your identity
and ego and all that.

00:48:28.900 --> 00:48:34.270 align:middle line:84%
That are based on these kinds
of compartmentalizations.

00:48:34.270 --> 00:48:39.220 align:middle line:84%
And then people, whether
they are meditating or doing

00:48:39.220 --> 00:48:42.900 align:middle line:84%
any other deep
compartmentalizing things,

00:48:42.900 --> 00:48:46.750 align:middle line:90%
they get a new opening.

00:48:46.750 --> 00:48:49.730 align:middle line:84%
They see a new opening
for something else.

00:48:49.730 --> 00:48:53.257 align:middle line:84%
A more direct contact
with the divine.

00:48:53.257 --> 00:48:55.840 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And that seems to be
how most people that experience

00:48:55.840 --> 00:48:58.420 align:middle line:90%
psychotropic drugs explain it.

00:48:58.420 --> 00:49:00.970 align:middle line:84%
That it's as though they
were in touch with something

00:49:00.970 --> 00:49:03.020 align:middle line:90%
higher on some level.

00:49:03.020 --> 00:49:03.820 align:middle line:90%
>>CARL: Yeah.

00:49:03.820 --> 00:49:04.620 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:49:04.620 --> 00:49:06.850 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Something giving
guidance, even, right?

00:49:06.850 --> 00:49:09.460 align:middle line:84%
And then you have
the drug ecstasy,

00:49:09.460 --> 00:49:12.040 align:middle line:84%
which just kind of blows
everyone open into a state

00:49:12.040 --> 00:49:15.250 align:middle line:84%
of-- it seems to create this
common "we-ness" as you say.

00:49:15.250 --> 00:49:17.050 align:middle line:90%
The sense of unity and love.

00:49:17.050 --> 00:49:19.240 align:middle line:84%
I mean, and we are
not suggesting,

00:49:19.240 --> 00:49:22.418 align:middle line:84%
I'm not suggesting, any
of this as a prescription.

00:49:22.418 --> 00:49:23.710 align:middle line:90%
This is not advice of any kind.

00:49:23.710 --> 00:49:25.660 align:middle line:84%
We're just talking
about the states

00:49:25.660 --> 00:49:27.790 align:middle line:84%
that have been observed
with various drugs,

00:49:27.790 --> 00:49:28.960 align:middle line:90%
psychotropic drugs.

00:49:28.960 --> 00:49:32.980 align:middle line:84%
And it seems that ecstasy
is one that has taken people

00:49:32.980 --> 00:49:35.680 align:middle line:84%
kind of universally
into this loving unity

00:49:35.680 --> 00:49:37.340 align:middle line:90%
type of consciousness, right?

00:49:37.340 --> 00:49:39.130 align:middle line:84%
So something going
on with whatever part

00:49:39.130 --> 00:49:40.480 align:middle line:90%
of the brain that's stimulating.

00:49:40.480 --> 00:49:41.020 align:middle line:90%
>>CARL: Yeah,.

00:49:41.020 --> 00:49:43.210 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: But what about
the notion if we simply

00:49:43.210 --> 00:49:48.620 align:middle line:84%
say, I choose, because I can
feel that the rightness of it.

00:49:48.620 --> 00:49:50.500 align:middle line:90%
I choose unity.

00:49:50.500 --> 00:49:54.430 align:middle line:90%
I want to be part of something.

00:49:54.430 --> 00:49:57.370 align:middle line:84%
A part of something that's
beautiful and that serves all.

00:49:57.370 --> 00:49:58.540 align:middle line:90%
That's collaborative.

00:49:58.540 --> 00:50:00.850 align:middle line:84%
Which is getting more into
the feminine frequencies

00:50:00.850 --> 00:50:03.730 align:middle line:84%
of coordination,
collaboration, and so forth.

00:50:03.730 --> 00:50:05.650 align:middle line:84%
Unity consciousness
is generally,

00:50:05.650 --> 00:50:08.380 align:middle line:84%
as we classically call it,
more feminine in nature.

00:50:08.380 --> 00:50:09.820 align:middle line:90%
It serves all.

00:50:09.820 --> 00:50:11.800 align:middle line:84%
So what if you choose
that and you say, OK.

00:50:11.800 --> 00:50:13.570 align:middle line:90%
This is my practice now.

00:50:13.570 --> 00:50:14.410 align:middle line:90%
I choose unity.

00:50:14.410 --> 00:50:16.390 align:middle line:90%
I choose to see you as my equal.

00:50:16.390 --> 00:50:17.805 align:middle line:90%
>>CARL: Yeah.

00:50:17.805 --> 00:50:19.180 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So let's
talk about how

00:50:19.180 --> 00:50:20.570 align:middle line:90%
we can do this without drugs.

00:50:20.570 --> 00:50:21.370 align:middle line:90%
>>CARL: Yeah.

00:50:21.370 --> 00:50:21.850 align:middle line:90%
Right.

00:50:21.850 --> 00:50:22.650 align:middle line:90%
Right.

00:50:22.650 --> 00:50:25.180 align:middle line:84%
Yeah, because I
don't think you get

00:50:25.180 --> 00:50:30.345 align:middle line:84%
to the "we" state with
drugs or medication either.

00:50:30.345 --> 00:50:31.470 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: I agree with you.

00:50:31.470 --> 00:50:32.690 align:middle line:90%
And not even meditation.

00:50:32.690 --> 00:50:33.520 align:middle line:90%
It's still you.

00:50:33.520 --> 00:50:33.950 align:middle line:90%
>>CARL: Yeah.

00:50:33.950 --> 00:50:34.750 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:50:34.750 --> 00:50:39.520 align:middle line:84%
Well, you know, I collaborate
with Patricia Albere.

00:50:39.520 --> 00:50:46.270 align:middle line:84%
And I think she has come far
in developing actual practices

00:50:46.270 --> 00:50:50.522 align:middle line:84%
of getting to this
"we-ness" state.

00:50:50.522 --> 00:50:52.480 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Spell her name
for us so other people

00:50:52.480 --> 00:50:53.040 align:middle line:90%
can look her up.

00:50:53.040 --> 00:50:53.860 align:middle line:90%
>>CARL: OK.

00:50:53.860 --> 00:50:56.360 align:middle line:90%
A-L-B-E-R-E.

00:50:56.360 --> 00:50:57.160 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: OK.

00:50:57.160 --> 00:51:00.670 align:middle line:84%
And what is she doing that
has garnered your respect?

00:51:00.670 --> 00:51:05.830 align:middle line:84%
>>CARL: , Well I've been to
some of her courses or practices

00:51:05.830 --> 00:51:06.800 align:middle line:90%
and so forth.

00:51:06.800 --> 00:51:10.630 align:middle line:84%
And it's very hard to describe,
actually, what happens.

00:51:10.630 --> 00:51:14.300 align:middle line:84%
But you connect
with other people.

00:51:14.300 --> 00:51:17.770 align:middle line:84%
So one of the things that
she is saying quite clearly

00:51:17.770 --> 00:51:20.590 align:middle line:84%
is that this is not
something you get

00:51:20.590 --> 00:51:23.590 align:middle line:90%
to as a separate individual.

00:51:23.590 --> 00:51:27.610 align:middle line:84%
You don't-- and that
means that while, say,

00:51:27.610 --> 00:51:33.100 align:middle line:84%
psychotropics or meditations
may prepare you for that state,

00:51:33.100 --> 00:51:36.400 align:middle line:84%
it doesn't take you
to that quantum leap.

00:51:36.400 --> 00:51:42.610 align:middle line:84%
But it is-- you are
together, you're creating

00:51:42.610 --> 00:51:45.810 align:middle line:84%
or you're accessing directly
from the source, which

00:51:45.810 --> 00:51:49.210 align:middle line:84%
would be what the Maya called
the Center of the Universe,

00:51:49.210 --> 00:51:50.010 align:middle line:90%
so to speak.

00:51:50.010 --> 00:51:52.890 align:middle line:90%
You're accessing this wave.

00:51:52.890 --> 00:51:58.530 align:middle line:84%
And a state of "we-ness",
which is not you plus me.

00:51:58.530 --> 00:52:00.310 align:middle line:90%
It's not as simple as that.

00:52:00.310 --> 00:52:02.820 align:middle line:84%
It's something other
than you plus me.

00:52:02.820 --> 00:52:04.168 align:middle line:90%
It's not just our--

00:52:04.168 --> 00:52:05.460 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: It's not us combined.

00:52:05.460 --> 00:52:07.400 align:middle line:84%
There's a unity
that overrides that.

00:52:07.400 --> 00:52:08.590 align:middle line:90%
>>CARL: It's a shared unity.

00:52:08.590 --> 00:52:09.390 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:52:09.390 --> 00:52:12.750 align:middle line:84%
>>CARL: It's not just we
having a good relationship.

00:52:12.750 --> 00:52:15.990 align:middle line:84%
It's something
else that comes in.

00:52:15.990 --> 00:52:21.120 align:middle line:84%
And then that becomes the
driving force, you might say.

00:52:21.120 --> 00:52:25.920 align:middle line:84%
The ninth wave bringing
the world into unity.

00:52:25.920 --> 00:52:26.720 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:52:26.720 --> 00:52:30.270 align:middle line:84%
And maybe it starts as simply as
seeing ourselves in each other,

00:52:30.270 --> 00:52:32.140 align:middle line:90%
and it's all part of the same.

00:52:32.140 --> 00:52:33.000 align:middle line:90%
And that's a choice.

00:52:33.000 --> 00:52:35.080 align:middle line:84%
That's something we have
to switch gears and say,

00:52:35.080 --> 00:52:38.430 align:middle line:84%
I am choosing to view
my fellow human this way

00:52:38.430 --> 00:52:40.420 align:middle line:84%
so we can rise together
in this consciousness.

00:52:40.420 --> 00:52:41.220 align:middle line:90%
>>CARL: Yeah.

00:52:41.220 --> 00:52:43.110 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And there's
one thing I want--

00:52:43.110 --> 00:52:45.000 align:middle line:84%
because we're
about out of time--

00:52:45.000 --> 00:52:47.700 align:middle line:84%
that I thought was really
interesting as a prospect.

00:52:47.700 --> 00:52:51.720 align:middle line:84%
About when you're entering a
time of unity consciousness,

00:52:51.720 --> 00:52:53.490 align:middle line:84%
the old underpinnings
of the patriarchy

00:52:53.490 --> 00:52:54.960 align:middle line:90%
need to be let go of.

00:52:54.960 --> 00:52:57.010 align:middle line:90%
And so you were talking about--

00:52:57.010 --> 00:52:59.310 align:middle line:84%
and I wrote this
down as a question--

00:52:59.310 --> 00:53:01.590 align:middle line:84%
have we entered a
time, then, we don't

00:53:01.590 --> 00:53:04.890 align:middle line:84%
need dictators and strongmen
and strong leaders?

00:53:04.890 --> 00:53:06.810 align:middle line:84%
We actually maybe
need malleable,

00:53:06.810 --> 00:53:11.190 align:middle line:84%
weak, quote, "leaders"
so that we can all rise

00:53:11.190 --> 00:53:13.230 align:middle line:90%
together and mold each other.

00:53:13.230 --> 00:53:14.750 align:middle line:84%
Talk about that
for just a minute.

00:53:14.750 --> 00:53:15.020 align:middle line:90%
>>CARL: Yeah.

00:53:15.020 --> 00:53:15.880 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:53:15.880 --> 00:53:19.980 align:middle line:84%
Yeah, I think there's been
a tendency for strongmen

00:53:19.980 --> 00:53:22.270 align:middle line:90%
in this past 10 years or so.

00:53:22.270 --> 00:53:25.140 align:middle line:84%
But I think that more
reflects an attempt

00:53:25.140 --> 00:53:26.480 align:middle line:90%
to stay in the previous--

00:53:26.480 --> 00:53:28.380 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: To cling
onto the sixth wave.

00:53:28.380 --> 00:53:29.460 align:middle line:90%
>>CARL: Cling on to that.

00:53:29.460 --> 00:53:31.990 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So let's just say
that's an attempt to cling on.

00:53:31.990 --> 00:53:35.400 align:middle line:84%
And so what about someone who
is more malleable and soft?

00:53:35.400 --> 00:53:36.270 align:middle line:90%
>>CARL: Exactly.

00:53:36.270 --> 00:53:41.090 align:middle line:84%
Well, I think we don't
need big egos anymore.

00:53:41.090 --> 00:53:42.780 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: It doesn't
serve the unity.

00:53:42.780 --> 00:53:44.890 align:middle line:84%
>>CARL: It doesn't
serve the unity.

00:53:44.890 --> 00:53:49.170 align:middle line:84%
And so I think that's one of the
big mistakes that have happened

00:53:49.170 --> 00:53:51.850 align:middle line:90%
in our current civilization.

00:53:51.850 --> 00:53:55.950 align:middle line:84%
And it goes back to this,
maybe, the Jewish Christian God

00:53:55.950 --> 00:53:58.890 align:middle line:84%
and that whole story
when people really

00:53:58.890 --> 00:54:02.610 align:middle line:84%
started to think that we
are in control as humans.

00:54:02.610 --> 00:54:07.060 align:middle line:84%
And that had consequences for
our relationship to nature

00:54:07.060 --> 00:54:08.400 align:middle line:90%
and so forth.

00:54:08.400 --> 00:54:16.380 align:middle line:84%
No, I think whatever serves
a more humble and not big

00:54:16.380 --> 00:54:21.330 align:middle line:84%
ego thing is really what the
future needs, and will actually

00:54:21.330 --> 00:54:22.335 align:middle line:90%
be supportive of.

00:54:22.335 --> 00:54:24.210 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Is there any
final thought on this?

00:54:24.210 --> 00:54:27.340 align:middle line:84%
Because I love what you
just said-- it feels right.

00:54:27.340 --> 00:54:28.140 align:middle line:90%
>>CARL: Thank you.

00:54:28.140 --> 00:54:29.910 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:54:29.910 --> 00:54:32.910 align:middle line:84%
Well, I guess I want to
emphasize something here.

00:54:32.910 --> 00:54:36.480 align:middle line:84%
That when it comes to
the Mayan calendar system

00:54:36.480 --> 00:54:40.480 align:middle line:84%
is that it is really
a quantum theory.

00:54:40.480 --> 00:54:43.350 align:middle line:84%
Which is different from
astrology and so forth, which

00:54:43.350 --> 00:54:47.880 align:middle line:84%
is always about smooth
repeated cycles and so forth.

00:54:47.880 --> 00:54:54.930 align:middle line:84%
And in a sense, that makes
it more challenging, we said.

00:54:54.930 --> 00:54:57.937 align:middle line:84%
It's almost like you
have to take the leap--

00:54:57.937 --> 00:54:59.020 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: A leap of faith.

00:54:59.020 --> 00:55:00.258 align:middle line:90%
You have to chance it.

00:55:00.258 --> 00:55:01.800 align:middle line:84%
It's not going to
just happen to you.

00:55:01.800 --> 00:55:03.030 align:middle line:90%
>>CARL: Right.

00:55:03.030 --> 00:55:06.300 align:middle line:10%
But anyway, that there is a
whole scientific background

00:55:06.300 --> 00:55:12.240 align:middle line:10%
to this kind of quantum
evolution of the universe

00:55:12.240 --> 00:55:16.620 align:middle line:10%
that I think can place a
tremendous amount of things

00:55:16.620 --> 00:55:21.400 align:middle line:10%
into their rightful place
in a meaningful way.

00:55:21.400 --> 00:55:23.218 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: I relate to
it, and I know people

00:55:23.218 --> 00:55:24.510 align:middle line:90%
enjoyed our previous interview.

00:55:24.510 --> 00:55:26.220 align:middle line:84%
They're enjoying your
interviews with other people

00:55:26.220 --> 00:55:27.020 align:middle line:90%
and your work.

00:55:27.020 --> 00:55:29.520 align:middle line:90%
I think you're arriving--

00:55:29.520 --> 00:55:32.970 align:middle line:84%
your work has arrived
right in the perfect time.

00:55:32.970 --> 00:55:34.470 align:middle line:84%
And so I want to
thank you for that.

00:55:34.470 --> 00:55:35.360 align:middle line:90%
>>CARL: Thank you.

00:55:35.360 --> 00:55:35.930 align:middle line:90%
Thank you.

00:55:35.930 --> 00:55:36.730 align:middle line:90%
That's kind.

00:55:36.730 --> 00:55:38.130 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Thank you, Carl.

00:55:38.130 --> 00:55:40.020 align:middle line:10%
The title of Carl's
book is "Quantum Science

00:55:40.020 --> 00:55:42.990 align:middle line:10%
of Psychedelics", which you
can find at major booksellers.

00:55:42.990 --> 00:55:45.000 align:middle line:10%
You can also go to
his site Calleman.com.

00:55:45.000 --> 00:55:49.910 align:middle line:10%
Until next time, thank you for
joining us here on Open Minds.
