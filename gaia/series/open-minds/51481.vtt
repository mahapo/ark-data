00:00:28.080 --> 00:00:29.830 align:middle line:10%
>>REGINA MEREDITH:
There are so few places

00:00:29.830 --> 00:00:32.509 align:middle line:10%
to turn to get any real
information on the economy

00:00:32.509 --> 00:00:35.160 align:middle line:10%
that I turn to Andy Hoffman
every few months to give us

00:00:35.160 --> 00:00:39.050 align:middle line:10%
an update as to what's going
on a global economic level.

00:00:39.050 --> 00:00:42.180 align:middle line:84%
Today, we'll talk about what
quantitative easing was really

00:00:42.180 --> 00:00:44.740 align:middle line:84%
about, how the Chinese are
printing more money than all

00:00:44.740 --> 00:00:47.540 align:middle line:84%
the central banks
combined, what that means,

00:00:47.540 --> 00:00:49.250 align:middle line:84%
the crashing of
the Indian rupee,

00:00:49.250 --> 00:00:52.260 align:middle line:84%
plus the real unemployment
numbers here in the US.

00:00:52.260 --> 00:00:54.370 align:middle line:90%
Andy welcome back.

00:00:54.370 --> 00:00:56.780 align:middle line:84%
It's always quite a
circus of information

00:00:56.780 --> 00:00:59.730 align:middle line:84%
when we get together because
so much as popping so fast.

00:00:59.730 --> 00:01:01.820 align:middle line:84%
It's almost like, how
can you put fingers

00:01:01.820 --> 00:01:03.610 align:middle line:90%
in all those dikes in the world?

00:01:03.610 --> 00:01:04.890 align:middle line:90%
How is it still afloat?

00:01:04.890 --> 00:01:07.360 align:middle line:84%
And why are we now
talking-- every time

00:01:07.360 --> 00:01:09.550 align:middle line:90%
I get the numbers from you.

00:01:09.550 --> 00:01:11.360 align:middle line:90%
Now we're looking at trillions.

00:01:11.360 --> 00:01:14.760 align:middle line:84%
It used to be millions when we
looked at deficits and trade.

00:01:14.760 --> 00:01:15.720 align:middle line:90%
Then it was billions.

00:01:15.720 --> 00:01:18.010 align:middle line:84%
Now, we're talking
commonly about trillions.

00:01:18.010 --> 00:01:19.910 align:middle line:84%
How is this possible
in a decade?

00:01:19.910 --> 00:01:21.785 align:middle line:84%
>>ANDREW HOFFMAN: Well,
I'll put it this way.

00:01:21.785 --> 00:01:23.120 align:middle line:90%
I write five days a week.

00:01:23.120 --> 00:01:26.860 align:middle line:84%
And I do three to four podcasts
and radio shows every week.

00:01:26.860 --> 00:01:29.170 align:middle line:84%
And again, there's
just no shortage

00:01:29.170 --> 00:01:32.202 align:middle line:84%
of what I call horrible
headlines to talk about.

00:01:32.202 --> 00:01:33.660 align:middle line:10%
Whether you're
talking about what's

00:01:33.660 --> 00:01:35.610 align:middle line:10%
going on in Europe or
Asia or, of course,

00:01:35.610 --> 00:01:37.607 align:middle line:10%
over here, and of
course what's going

00:01:37.607 --> 00:01:39.440 align:middle line:10%
on with the various
currencies in the world,

00:01:39.440 --> 00:01:41.970 align:middle line:10%
the geopolitical
strains, it really

00:01:41.970 --> 00:01:45.640 align:middle line:10%
is a 24/7 job to follow
all these things.

00:01:45.640 --> 00:01:49.009 align:middle line:84%
As for the -illions-- and I
remember when I was a kid,

00:01:49.009 --> 00:01:49.800 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: -illions.

00:01:49.800 --> 00:01:53.470 align:middle line:84%
>>HOFFMAN: --$1 million was a
lot of money even after tax,

00:01:53.470 --> 00:01:55.280 align:middle line:90%
or I should say even before tax.

00:01:55.280 --> 00:01:58.460 align:middle line:84%
Today, I think we're now
talking about quadrillions

00:01:58.460 --> 00:01:59.840 align:middle line:90%
when you talk about derivatives.

00:01:59.840 --> 00:02:02.010 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Now, that's a
number that you don't hear--

00:02:02.010 --> 00:02:02.460 align:middle line:90%
>>HOFFMAN: So we're into the Qs.

00:02:02.460 --> 00:02:03.030 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Yeah, you
don't hear people

00:02:03.030 --> 00:02:04.530 align:middle line:90%
talking about the quadrillions.

00:02:04.530 --> 00:02:08.169 align:middle line:84%
But when you get to the really
high numbers in finance,

00:02:08.169 --> 00:02:10.340 align:middle line:84%
the big picture, behind
the scenes stuff,

00:02:10.340 --> 00:02:12.200 align:middle line:90%
it is quadrillions.

00:02:12.200 --> 00:02:14.570 align:middle line:84%
>>HOFFMAN: Actually, the
Japanese national debt,

00:02:14.570 --> 00:02:17.120 align:middle line:84%
because their exchange
rate is 100 to 1,

00:02:17.120 --> 00:02:18.730 align:middle line:90%
is in quadrillions right now.

00:02:18.730 --> 00:02:20.460 align:middle line:90%
They just hit a quadrillion.

00:02:20.460 --> 00:02:24.260 align:middle line:84%
And of course, no one talks
about the derivative monster,

00:02:24.260 --> 00:02:26.190 align:middle line:84%
which is still there
larger than ever.

00:02:26.190 --> 00:02:26.780 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: No one talks about it.

00:02:26.780 --> 00:02:27.590 align:middle line:90%
No, you're right.

00:02:27.590 --> 00:02:29.629 align:middle line:84%
I wasn't even going
to ask you about it.

00:02:29.629 --> 00:02:31.920 align:middle line:84%
Because it's something that's
just kind of slipped away

00:02:31.920 --> 00:02:35.967 align:middle line:84%
with all the other bad news
that's riding above it.

00:02:35.967 --> 00:02:38.300 align:middle line:84%
Talk about that for just a
moment before we get rolling.

00:02:38.300 --> 00:02:42.680 align:middle line:84%
>>HOFFMAN: Well, remember since
2008, when the government,

00:02:42.680 --> 00:02:45.340 align:middle line:84%
and the banks-- when everyone
was taken by surprise,

00:02:45.340 --> 00:02:48.090 align:middle line:84%
they didn't realize that the
stupid things they were doing

00:02:48.090 --> 00:02:49.940 align:middle line:84%
would actually
come home to roost.

00:02:49.940 --> 00:02:51.520 align:middle line:84%
So the initial
reaction, of course,

00:02:51.520 --> 00:02:53.720 align:middle line:84%
was to print incredible
amounts of money

00:02:53.720 --> 00:02:57.315 align:middle line:84%
and, I say, liquefy the banks,
really just give the money.

00:02:57.315 --> 00:02:59.190 align:middle line:84%
And the other thing that
they did at the time

00:02:59.190 --> 00:03:01.105 align:middle line:84%
was, basically,
they said not only

00:03:01.105 --> 00:03:02.730 align:middle line:84%
we don't want to let
this happen again,

00:03:02.730 --> 00:03:05.070 align:middle line:84%
get taken by surprise--
meaning we'll give them

00:03:05.070 --> 00:03:06.820 align:middle line:84%
unlimited money,
which is what you have

00:03:06.820 --> 00:03:09.220 align:middle line:84%
with quantitative easing and
zero interest rate policy.

00:03:09.220 --> 00:03:11.720 align:middle line:84%
But we're also going to
rewrite the accounting rules.

00:03:11.720 --> 00:03:15.450 align:middle line:84%
And pretty much, we're going
to turn a blind eye to it.

00:03:15.450 --> 00:03:17.970 align:middle line:84%
The biggest accounting
rule change was in 2009.

00:03:17.970 --> 00:03:19.230 align:middle line:90%
It was April 2009.

00:03:19.230 --> 00:03:22.620 align:middle line:84%
So again, we're at the
height of the crash.

00:03:22.620 --> 00:03:25.150 align:middle line:84%
FASB, that's the Financial
Accounting Standards Board,

00:03:25.150 --> 00:03:27.160 align:middle line:84%
which is not a
government entity.

00:03:27.160 --> 00:03:29.190 align:middle line:90%
It's a trade union.

00:03:29.190 --> 00:03:30.870 align:middle line:84%
So they basically
sold their soul.

00:03:30.870 --> 00:03:33.600 align:middle line:84%
They sold their integrity,
kind of like a rating agency.

00:03:33.600 --> 00:03:35.840 align:middle line:84%
And they changed the
rules for banking

00:03:35.840 --> 00:03:40.369 align:middle line:84%
that said banks can now
value on their balance sheets

00:03:40.369 --> 00:03:42.660 align:middle line:84%
their assets, their bonds,
or whatever they would like.

00:03:42.660 --> 00:03:45.060 align:middle line:84%
So if they have something,
a bond that's worth $0.10

00:03:45.060 --> 00:03:45.560 align:middle line:90%
on the $1--

00:03:45.560 --> 00:03:46.240 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Yeah,
it's a junk bond.

00:03:46.240 --> 00:03:48.060 align:middle line:84%
>>HOFFMAN: --they can
say we're valuing it

00:03:48.060 --> 00:03:52.150 align:middle line:84%
at par, at what it will
be worth at maturity.

00:03:52.150 --> 00:03:54.620 align:middle line:84%
And the same goes
for derivatives.

00:03:54.620 --> 00:03:58.190 align:middle line:10%
They suddenly one day reduced
the amount of derivatives

00:03:58.190 --> 00:04:01.480 align:middle line:10%
by 30% or 40% simply
with the stroke of a pen,

00:04:01.480 --> 00:04:04.240 align:middle line:10%
by simply saying we will
simply define it differently.

00:04:04.240 --> 00:04:07.130 align:middle line:10%
In fact, the new vogue
thing-- and we've

00:04:07.130 --> 00:04:10.380 align:middle line:10%
talked about economic data,
and we will in a second,

00:04:10.380 --> 00:04:14.897 align:middle line:10%
how everything is a lie-- is
GDP numbers around the world.

00:04:14.897 --> 00:04:15.480 align:middle line:10%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:04:15.480 --> 00:04:17.880 align:middle line:10%
>>HOFFMAN: We did it in the
states about a year ago.

00:04:17.880 --> 00:04:20.940 align:middle line:10%
We decided that any
research and development

00:04:20.940 --> 00:04:23.560 align:middle line:10%
should be considered GDP even
if it doesn't produce anything.

00:04:23.560 --> 00:04:24.330 align:middle line:10%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:04:24.330 --> 00:04:27.420 align:middle line:10%
>>HOFFMAN: Goodwill on purchases
should be considered GDP,

00:04:27.420 --> 00:04:29.087 align:middle line:10%
even though it doesn't
produce anything.

00:04:29.087 --> 00:04:30.211 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: So wait a minute.

00:04:30.211 --> 00:04:30.990 align:middle line:90%
Explain that.

00:04:30.990 --> 00:04:32.304 align:middle line:90%
Goodwill on purchases.

00:04:32.304 --> 00:04:32.970 align:middle line:90%
>>HOFFMAN: Yeah.

00:04:32.970 --> 00:04:34.428 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: What does
that even mean?

00:04:34.428 --> 00:04:38.550 align:middle line:84%
>>HOFFMAN: When a company buys
another company at a price

00:04:38.550 --> 00:04:41.364 align:middle line:84%
that's more than the value
on their balance sheet--

00:04:41.364 --> 00:04:42.030 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:04:42.030 --> 00:04:43.700 align:middle line:84%
>>HOFFMAN: --if they have a net
worth of $1 billion and they

00:04:43.700 --> 00:04:44.620 align:middle line:90%
pay $2 billion--

00:04:44.620 --> 00:04:45.414 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:04:45.414 --> 00:04:46.460 align:middle line:90%
That's called goodwill?

00:04:46.460 --> 00:04:47.510 align:middle line:84%
>>HOFFMAN: That asset
is called goodwill.

00:04:47.510 --> 00:04:48.280 align:middle line:90%
OK?

00:04:48.280 --> 00:04:49.200 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: OK.

00:04:49.200 --> 00:04:51.670 align:middle line:84%
>>HOFFMAN: And typically,
historically, most goodwill

00:04:51.670 --> 00:04:52.410 align:middle line:90%
is written off.

00:04:52.410 --> 00:04:56.110 align:middle line:84%
Because most acquisitions are
done at too high of prices.

00:04:56.110 --> 00:04:58.100 align:middle line:84%
But the point is that
the US government is now

00:04:58.100 --> 00:05:00.090 align:middle line:84%
considering all
these things that

00:05:00.090 --> 00:05:02.097 align:middle line:84%
really have no
value to be assets.

00:05:02.097 --> 00:05:03.180 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Part of the GDP.

00:05:03.180 --> 00:05:05.980 align:middle line:84%
>>HOFFMAN: So now all of a
sudden the GDP gets marked up.

00:05:05.980 --> 00:05:10.420 align:middle line:84%
And the debt to GDP ratio, which
is what all of the mainstream

00:05:10.420 --> 00:05:13.280 align:middle line:84%
economists focus on-- they
say, oh well, their debt to GDP

00:05:13.280 --> 00:05:13.780 align:middle line:90%
is lower.

00:05:13.780 --> 00:05:15.710 align:middle line:84%
So obviously, they're
in better shape.

00:05:15.710 --> 00:05:17.640 align:middle line:84%
China just did the same
thing right after us.

00:05:17.640 --> 00:05:19.590 align:middle line:84%
And the best one
was this past week.

00:05:19.590 --> 00:05:23.160 align:middle line:84%
Nigeria just did it,
so much so that they

00:05:23.160 --> 00:05:25.432 align:middle line:84%
became the largest
economy in Africa.

00:05:25.432 --> 00:05:28.390 align:middle line:84%
And this is Nigeria,
which is one

00:05:28.390 --> 00:05:30.240 align:middle line:84%
of the most backward
places on the planet.

00:05:30.240 --> 00:05:30.823 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:05:30.823 --> 00:05:33.630 align:middle line:84%
>>HOFFMAN: So the fact is that
quadrillions, quintillions,

00:05:33.630 --> 00:05:36.290 align:middle line:84%
you name it, there's a lot
more going on behind the scenes

00:05:36.290 --> 00:05:37.895 align:middle line:90%
than you're being told.

00:05:37.895 --> 00:05:38.770 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Well, yeah.

00:05:38.770 --> 00:05:39.230 align:middle line:90%
No kidding.

00:05:39.230 --> 00:05:40.460 align:middle line:84%
That's why we're
having you here.

00:05:40.460 --> 00:05:40.960 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:05:40.960 --> 00:05:44.240 align:middle line:84%
We're going to go through some
of the primary players, what's

00:05:44.240 --> 00:05:45.730 align:middle line:90%
going on in those countries.

00:05:45.730 --> 00:05:48.352 align:middle line:84%
And then ultimately, we'll
end up at the US, OK?

00:05:48.352 --> 00:05:49.560 align:middle line:90%
So we're starting with China.

00:05:49.560 --> 00:05:52.650 align:middle line:84%
And I ask for your help on
this, just so everyone knows.

00:05:52.650 --> 00:05:54.640 align:middle line:84%
It's so confusing
I don't even know

00:05:54.640 --> 00:05:56.590 align:middle line:84%
where to begin on this
interview anymore.

00:05:56.590 --> 00:05:58.710 align:middle line:84%
So you've given me
some background data

00:05:58.710 --> 00:05:59.790 align:middle line:90%
on these countries.

00:05:59.790 --> 00:06:01.980 align:middle line:84%
So let's go ahead
and start with China,

00:06:01.980 --> 00:06:05.450 align:middle line:84%
what I said in the opening,
just sheer amount of printing

00:06:05.450 --> 00:06:07.504 align:middle line:84%
of money and what that's
going to do to us.

00:06:07.504 --> 00:06:08.920 align:middle line:84%
And what it's going
to do to them,

00:06:08.920 --> 00:06:10.630 align:middle line:84%
what it's going to do
to the global economy.

00:06:10.630 --> 00:06:11.588 align:middle line:90%
Let's talk about China.

00:06:11.588 --> 00:06:13.990 align:middle line:84%
>>HOFFMAN: Well,
the enigma of China

00:06:13.990 --> 00:06:16.990 align:middle line:84%
is that because
they've grown so fast--

00:06:16.990 --> 00:06:19.770 align:middle line:84%
and again, I use the word
grown with quotes around it.

00:06:19.770 --> 00:06:23.349 align:middle line:84%
Because a lot of such growth
is unproductive growth.

00:06:23.349 --> 00:06:25.390 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Let's talk about
the unproductive part.

00:06:25.390 --> 00:06:27.060 align:middle line:84%
We know about the
stuff at Walmart.

00:06:27.060 --> 00:06:27.910 align:middle line:90%
>>HOFFMAN: Yes.

00:06:27.910 --> 00:06:29.660 align:middle line:84%
Well, the stuff at
Walmart is real growth.

00:06:29.660 --> 00:06:30.618 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: That's right.

00:06:30.618 --> 00:06:32.710 align:middle line:84%
>>HOFFMAN: They've take
our manufacturing jobs,

00:06:32.710 --> 00:06:35.000 align:middle line:84%
because they can
produce them cheaper.

00:06:35.000 --> 00:06:36.870 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: We've given
to them, haven't we?

00:06:36.870 --> 00:06:37.180 align:middle line:90%
>>HOFFMAN: Yes.

00:06:37.180 --> 00:06:38.513 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: They didn't take them.

00:06:38.513 --> 00:06:39.140 align:middle line:90%
We gave them.

00:06:39.140 --> 00:06:40.765 align:middle line:84%
>>HOFFMAN: Well, it's
a little of each.

00:06:40.765 --> 00:06:44.270 align:middle line:84%
Because of course in time,
those jobs would've gone there.

00:06:44.270 --> 00:06:45.490 align:middle line:90%
Because they produce cheaper.

00:06:45.490 --> 00:06:45.800 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:06:45.800 --> 00:06:47.150 align:middle line:84%
>>HOFFMAN: They have a
billion and a half people.

00:06:47.150 --> 00:06:48.635 align:middle line:84%
And ultimately, if
their government

00:06:48.635 --> 00:06:50.100 align:middle line:84%
wants to feed the
people, that have

00:06:50.100 --> 00:06:51.950 align:middle line:84%
to give them the
means to do that.

00:06:51.950 --> 00:06:54.820 align:middle line:84%
One way is simple communism,
which doesn't work.

00:06:54.820 --> 00:06:57.000 align:middle line:84%
Another way is to
try to create jobs.

00:06:57.000 --> 00:07:00.060 align:middle line:84%
And the easiest thing
to do was to entice

00:07:00.060 --> 00:07:01.420 align:middle line:90%
jobs to come over seas.

00:07:01.420 --> 00:07:08.070 align:middle line:84%
And part of that was simply
greedy Western corporate titans

00:07:08.070 --> 00:07:10.810 align:middle line:84%
who lobbied Congress
to have all these

00:07:10.810 --> 00:07:13.120 align:middle line:84%
liberalized trade
deals, like China

00:07:13.120 --> 00:07:15.069 align:middle line:84%
being given the most
favored national status--

00:07:15.069 --> 00:07:15.694 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:07:15.694 --> 00:07:15.880 align:middle line:90%
Favored status.

00:07:15.880 --> 00:07:17.588 align:middle line:10%
>>HOFFMAN: --even
though we theoretically

00:07:17.588 --> 00:07:20.010 align:middle line:10%
didn't agree with their
civil rights things.

00:07:20.010 --> 00:07:23.710 align:middle line:10%
Because a bunch of the companies
got a lot of money from that.

00:07:23.710 --> 00:07:25.560 align:middle line:10%
They got the cheap labor.

00:07:25.560 --> 00:07:27.470 align:middle line:10%
The problem is all
the jobs went away.

00:07:27.470 --> 00:07:29.690 align:middle line:10%
So the jobs would've
gone there in time.

00:07:29.690 --> 00:07:31.330 align:middle line:84%
But we really
accelerated that process.

00:07:31.330 --> 00:07:32.040 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: So we did.

00:07:32.040 --> 00:07:32.310 align:middle line:90%
>>HOFFMAN: Yes.

00:07:32.310 --> 00:07:33.645 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: But still,
those are assets.

00:07:33.645 --> 00:07:34.020 align:middle line:90%
>>HOFFMAN: Yes.

00:07:34.020 --> 00:07:35.870 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: You know,
that's some real growth--

00:07:35.870 --> 00:07:36.140 align:middle line:90%
>>HOFFMAN: Absolutely.

00:07:36.140 --> 00:07:37.820 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: --real
product, real exports.

00:07:37.820 --> 00:07:39.410 align:middle line:84%
Let's talk about
the hidden stuff

00:07:39.410 --> 00:07:41.674 align:middle line:84%
that we don't see that
is actually just not.

00:07:41.674 --> 00:07:43.090 align:middle line:84%
>>HOFFMAN: The
problem is when you

00:07:43.090 --> 00:07:46.880 align:middle line:84%
have a billion and a half people
is there is not enough jobs.

00:07:46.880 --> 00:07:48.250 align:middle line:90%
There'll never be enough jobs.

00:07:48.250 --> 00:07:52.500 align:middle line:84%
I mean, global population
growth is a problem everywhere.

00:07:52.500 --> 00:07:54.000 align:middle line:84%
I mean, when I was
a kid, there were

00:07:54.000 --> 00:07:55.540 align:middle line:84%
a few billion
people in the world.

00:07:55.540 --> 00:07:56.248 align:middle line:90%
I'm not that old.

00:07:56.248 --> 00:07:57.807 align:middle line:90%
There's 7 billion people now.

00:07:57.807 --> 00:07:59.890 align:middle line:84%
And then we're going to
talk about resources being

00:07:59.890 --> 00:08:03.190 align:middle line:84%
scant, food, energy,
and of course, gold.

00:08:03.190 --> 00:08:05.910 align:middle line:84%
So no matter what
the Chinese do,

00:08:05.910 --> 00:08:08.800 align:middle line:84%
they're never going to be
able to feed everybody.

00:08:08.800 --> 00:08:12.630 align:middle line:84%
There's going to have to
be some decisions made.

00:08:12.630 --> 00:08:15.040 align:middle line:84%
So one of the things
that they decided to do

00:08:15.040 --> 00:08:18.425 align:middle line:84%
was A, to peg their
currency to the dollar.

00:08:18.425 --> 00:08:19.050 align:middle line:10%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:08:19.050 --> 00:08:19.770 align:middle line:10%
The yuan.

00:08:19.770 --> 00:08:20.990 align:middle line:10%
>>HOFFMAN: People
don't realize that.

00:08:20.990 --> 00:08:22.260 align:middle line:10%
I mean, a lot of
countries have done it.

00:08:22.260 --> 00:08:24.330 align:middle line:10%
In fact, Hong Kong,
high profile economy,

00:08:24.330 --> 00:08:26.120 align:middle line:10%
has done it for years as well.

00:08:26.120 --> 00:08:30.290 align:middle line:10%
But for China to peg the
currency to the dollar--

00:08:30.290 --> 00:08:32.039 align:middle line:10%
when you peg a currency,
basically the way

00:08:32.039 --> 00:08:33.260 align:middle line:10%
you do it is you print money.

00:08:33.260 --> 00:08:36.950 align:middle line:84%
So every dollar the Fed prints,
the People's Bank of China,

00:08:36.950 --> 00:08:39.049 align:middle line:90%
the PBOC, they print yuan.

00:08:39.049 --> 00:08:41.907 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And when you
say peg, is it a 1 to 1?

00:08:41.907 --> 00:08:42.490 align:middle line:90%
Or what is it?

00:08:42.490 --> 00:08:44.436 align:middle line:84%
>>HOFFMAN: No, it
was roughly 6 to 1.

00:08:44.436 --> 00:08:45.804 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: 6 to 1.

00:08:45.804 --> 00:08:47.130 align:middle line:90%
6 to 1 yuan to the dollar.

00:08:47.130 --> 00:08:47.796 align:middle line:90%
>>HOFFMAN: Yeah.

00:08:47.796 --> 00:08:49.849 align:middle line:84%
And they've created
trading bands over it.

00:08:49.849 --> 00:08:50.390 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: OK.

00:08:50.390 --> 00:08:51.810 align:middle line:84%
>>HOFFMAN: So it
can theoretically

00:08:51.810 --> 00:08:53.379 align:middle line:90%
move, but very, very slowly.

00:08:53.379 --> 00:08:53.920 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: OK.

00:08:53.920 --> 00:08:55.014 align:middle line:90%
So 6 to the dollar.

00:08:55.014 --> 00:08:55.680 align:middle line:90%
>>HOFFMAN: Yeah.

00:08:55.680 --> 00:08:58.280 align:middle line:84%
And in fact-- well,
if we skip ahead,

00:08:58.280 --> 00:08:59.750 align:middle line:84%
they just widened
the trading band.

00:08:59.750 --> 00:09:02.150 align:middle line:10%
Because they want to devalue
the currency further.

00:09:02.150 --> 00:09:02.816 align:middle line:10%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:09:02.816 --> 00:09:04.690 align:middle line:10%
>>HOFFMAN: But the
point is in doing

00:09:04.690 --> 00:09:08.030 align:middle line:10%
so, in pegging the
yuan to the dollar,

00:09:08.030 --> 00:09:10.440 align:middle line:10%
they brought a lot more jobs
than they would have brought

00:09:10.440 --> 00:09:12.060 align:middle line:10%
even with the cheap labor.

00:09:12.060 --> 00:09:13.960 align:middle line:84%
Because it makes the
cost of production

00:09:13.960 --> 00:09:16.040 align:middle line:84%
so much cheaper for
foreign companies.

00:09:16.040 --> 00:09:19.130 align:middle line:84%
And it distorts the
economy dramatically.

00:09:19.130 --> 00:09:22.170 align:middle line:84%
And then, of course, it
creates inflation within China.

00:09:22.170 --> 00:09:23.870 align:middle line:84%
Because they're
devaluing the currency.

00:09:23.870 --> 00:09:25.820 align:middle line:84%
Again, a billion and
a half people, they

00:09:25.820 --> 00:09:26.760 align:middle line:90%
have to buy things.

00:09:26.760 --> 00:09:28.162 align:middle line:90%
So major distortions.

00:09:28.162 --> 00:09:30.370 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And they live so
marginally, in many cases,

00:09:30.370 --> 00:09:30.635 align:middle line:90%
anyway.

00:09:30.635 --> 00:09:30.900 align:middle line:90%
>>HOFFMAN: Yes.

00:09:30.900 --> 00:09:33.050 align:middle line:84%
And it's no different than
what we do here with the Fed.

00:09:33.050 --> 00:09:33.270 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right

00:09:33.270 --> 00:09:35.603 align:middle line:84%
>>HOFFMAN: But the thing is
we have to reserve currency.

00:09:35.603 --> 00:09:39.320 align:middle line:84%
So the effects of our inflation
are more like frogs in a pot.

00:09:39.320 --> 00:09:42.230 align:middle line:84%
We fill it slowly,
slowly, slowly.

00:09:42.230 --> 00:09:43.870 align:middle line:84%
But in other parts
of the world, that's

00:09:43.870 --> 00:09:45.260 align:middle line:84%
why we're having
these currency crises.

00:09:45.260 --> 00:09:46.796 align:middle line:90%
They fill it very, very quickly.

00:09:46.796 --> 00:09:47.712 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Immediately.

00:09:47.712 --> 00:09:50.600 align:middle line:10%
>>HOFFMAN: That's why the Arab
Spring was the first to happen.

00:09:50.600 --> 00:09:52.880 align:middle line:10%
Because the Arab countries
spend the most percentage

00:09:52.880 --> 00:09:54.087 align:middle line:10%
of their income on food.

00:09:54.087 --> 00:09:54.670 align:middle line:10%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:09:54.670 --> 00:09:57.336 align:middle line:10%
>>HOFFMAN: And things that go up
first are the things, as I say,

00:09:57.336 --> 00:09:58.260 align:middle line:10%
you need versus want.

00:09:58.260 --> 00:09:59.090 align:middle line:10%
Food is first.

00:09:59.090 --> 00:10:00.330 align:middle line:10%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:10:00.330 --> 00:10:00.660 align:middle line:90%
>>HOFFMAN: But anyway--

00:10:00.660 --> 00:10:02.080 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Well, you talk
about, also in China,

00:10:02.080 --> 00:10:03.215 align:middle line:90%
a shadow banking industry--

00:10:03.215 --> 00:10:03.840 align:middle line:90%
>>HOFFMAN: Yes.

00:10:03.840 --> 00:10:05.465 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: --in this
real estate bubble.

00:10:05.465 --> 00:10:07.145 align:middle line:84%
And we know about
these cities that

00:10:07.145 --> 00:10:09.145 align:middle line:84%
have been built that are
essentially in nowhere.

00:10:09.145 --> 00:10:10.020 align:middle line:90%
And they're empty.

00:10:10.020 --> 00:10:10.630 align:middle line:90%
>>HOFFMAN: They're ghost cities.

00:10:10.630 --> 00:10:10.960 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: They're ghost cities.

00:10:10.960 --> 00:10:12.920 align:middle line:84%
>>HOFFMAN: And this
is the second part

00:10:12.920 --> 00:10:15.440 align:middle line:84%
of what we're talking about
with unproductive growth.

00:10:15.440 --> 00:10:19.670 align:middle line:84%
One, they've devalued
the yuan over time,

00:10:19.670 --> 00:10:23.180 align:middle line:84%
which has caused a
greater distortion.

00:10:23.180 --> 00:10:26.920 align:middle line:84%
More and more jobs have come
to China than would have come.

00:10:26.920 --> 00:10:30.772 align:middle line:84%
And more production of things
that aren't needed in the world

00:10:30.772 --> 00:10:31.480 align:middle line:90%
came out of that.

00:10:31.480 --> 00:10:33.070 align:middle line:84%
The second part
that they've done

00:10:33.070 --> 00:10:37.670 align:middle line:84%
is they have fostered an
unregulated banking system.

00:10:37.670 --> 00:10:38.990 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: What's that mean?

00:10:38.990 --> 00:10:42.180 align:middle line:84%
>>HOFFMAN: Here in the States,
we have a very badly regulated

00:10:42.180 --> 00:10:43.987 align:middle line:84%
banking system,
which favors the--

00:10:43.987 --> 00:10:44.820 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: The banks.

00:10:44.820 --> 00:10:45.800 align:middle line:84%
>>HOFFMAN: --too
big to fail banks.

00:10:45.800 --> 00:10:46.390 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:10:46.390 --> 00:10:48.848 align:middle line:84%
>>HOFFMAN: But in China, for
the most part, they have none.

00:10:48.848 --> 00:10:52.220 align:middle line:10%
They have no FDIC that
protects investors.

00:10:52.220 --> 00:10:55.710 align:middle line:10%
They have no real rules that
limit the amount of lending

00:10:55.710 --> 00:10:58.310 align:middle line:10%
or kind of lending,
fair practices,

00:10:58.310 --> 00:10:59.610 align:middle line:10%
and know your customer.

00:10:59.610 --> 00:11:02.230 align:middle line:10%
So what they've done,
part of their back door

00:11:02.230 --> 00:11:07.780 align:middle line:10%
QE, as I call it, particularly
since 2008, the market crash,

00:11:07.780 --> 00:11:11.480 align:middle line:10%
has been to foster this
private lending system.

00:11:11.480 --> 00:11:13.080 align:middle line:10%
It's gotten so out of control.

00:11:13.080 --> 00:11:16.630 align:middle line:10%
Because anyone who has done
some history on the Chinese

00:11:16.630 --> 00:11:20.380 align:middle line:10%
know that they like to speculate
more than probably any culture.

00:11:20.380 --> 00:11:21.790 align:middle line:10%
They have a history of it.

00:11:21.790 --> 00:11:25.310 align:middle line:10%
And since the government has
fostered this shadow banking

00:11:25.310 --> 00:11:28.060 align:middle line:10%
bubble, especially
since 2008, there's

00:11:28.060 --> 00:11:31.790 align:middle line:10%
been massive, massive
construction building

00:11:31.790 --> 00:11:35.180 align:middle line:10%
around the country of
ghost cities, of roads,

00:11:35.180 --> 00:11:38.330 align:middle line:10%
you name it, and
condos, et cetera.

00:11:38.330 --> 00:11:41.470 align:middle line:84%
So the proponents, the
people who really are not

00:11:41.470 --> 00:11:43.520 align:middle line:84%
understanding what's
going on, will say well,

00:11:43.520 --> 00:11:45.840 align:middle line:84%
it's really the Chinese
simply building out

00:11:45.840 --> 00:11:48.120 align:middle line:84%
their infrastructure, so
they can rule the world.

00:11:48.120 --> 00:11:50.530 align:middle line:84%
But the fact is most
of this building

00:11:50.530 --> 00:11:52.970 align:middle line:84%
has not come from the
government, which is healthy.

00:11:52.970 --> 00:11:56.520 align:middle line:84%
It's come from the corporations,
the private citizens,

00:11:56.520 --> 00:12:01.360 align:middle line:84%
which are now the equivalent
of the sub-prime situation we

00:12:01.360 --> 00:12:02.110 align:middle line:90%
had in the States.

00:12:02.110 --> 00:12:04.200 align:middle line:90%
They're all going broke.

00:12:04.200 --> 00:12:06.900 align:middle line:84%
They're starting to declare
bankruptcy, these companies.

00:12:06.900 --> 00:12:09.110 align:middle line:84%
They're looking at all
these empty houses,

00:12:09.110 --> 00:12:12.130 align:middle line:84%
these vacant condos,
these ghost cities.

00:12:12.130 --> 00:12:15.530 align:middle line:84%
And they realized that
they're just not needed.

00:12:15.530 --> 00:12:17.980 align:middle line:84%
And that's why the price of
copper has started to fall.

00:12:17.980 --> 00:12:21.656 align:middle line:84%
So there's a lot of
collateral damage going on.

00:12:21.656 --> 00:12:23.030 align:middle line:84%
And as you said
in the beginning,

00:12:23.030 --> 00:12:25.155 align:middle line:84%
they're printing more than
the other central banks.

00:12:25.155 --> 00:12:27.760 align:middle line:84%
Well, now it's coming out
that they are actually

00:12:27.760 --> 00:12:29.080 align:middle line:90%
overtly printing money.

00:12:29.080 --> 00:12:33.130 align:middle line:84%
In January alone, the PBOC
printed more than three times

00:12:33.130 --> 00:12:35.540 align:middle line:84%
than the Fed and the
Bank of Japan combined.

00:12:35.540 --> 00:12:37.050 align:middle line:84%
Because they
realized, oh my god,

00:12:37.050 --> 00:12:39.730 align:middle line:84%
we have to do something or
everything's going to crash.

00:12:39.730 --> 00:12:41.220 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: PBOC,
Peoples Bank of--

00:12:41.220 --> 00:12:41.495 align:middle line:90%
>>HOFFMAN: China.

00:12:41.495 --> 00:12:41.770 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: --China.

00:12:41.770 --> 00:12:42.540 align:middle line:90%
>>HOFFMAN: That's their Fed.

00:12:42.540 --> 00:12:42.740 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:12:42.740 --> 00:12:42.910 align:middle line:90%
Right.

00:12:42.910 --> 00:12:43.560 align:middle line:84%
>>HOFFMAN: That's
their central bank.

00:12:43.560 --> 00:12:44.226 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:12:44.226 --> 00:12:45.720 align:middle line:84%
>>HOFFMAN: So
personally, I believe

00:12:45.720 --> 00:12:48.310 align:middle line:84%
that the crash that we're going
to see in China, real estate,

00:12:48.310 --> 00:12:50.535 align:middle line:84%
construction, credit,
will be historic.

00:12:50.535 --> 00:12:53.623 align:middle line:84%
It will make what's happened
in the Western world

00:12:53.623 --> 00:12:56.080 align:middle line:84%
in the last five years
look like nothing.

00:12:56.080 --> 00:12:59.130 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Well, it seemed like
it was so illogical even when

00:12:59.130 --> 00:12:59.920 align:middle line:90%
it was under way.

00:12:59.920 --> 00:13:02.940 align:middle line:84%
Because, I mean, you
had all these crashes

00:13:02.940 --> 00:13:04.580 align:middle line:84%
throughout other
parts of the world.

00:13:04.580 --> 00:13:05.930 align:middle line:90%
Famous-- Miami.

00:13:05.930 --> 00:13:08.270 align:middle line:84%
Even places in
California, huge tracts

00:13:08.270 --> 00:13:10.280 align:middle line:84%
developed that are
half empty now.

00:13:10.280 --> 00:13:12.350 align:middle line:84%
But there was
infrastructure that

00:13:12.350 --> 00:13:14.300 align:middle line:90%
was developed alongside it.

00:13:14.300 --> 00:13:16.340 align:middle line:84%
It seems as though a lot
of these ghost cities

00:13:16.340 --> 00:13:18.690 align:middle line:84%
had no infrastructure,
barely roads leading

00:13:18.690 --> 00:13:21.500 align:middle line:84%
to them and nothing there
out in the middle of nowhere.

00:13:21.500 --> 00:13:23.280 align:middle line:90%
Boom, here's this huge complex.

00:13:23.280 --> 00:13:25.600 align:middle line:84%
>>HOFFMAN: When you
have bubbles blowing up,

00:13:25.600 --> 00:13:27.420 align:middle line:90%
people don't understand.

00:13:27.420 --> 00:13:30.690 align:middle line:84%
It's kind of like
at the top in 2000,

00:13:30.690 --> 00:13:34.010 align:middle line:84%
we theoretically reported
a government surplus here

00:13:34.010 --> 00:13:34.770 align:middle line:90%
in the States.

00:13:34.770 --> 00:13:35.130 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:13:35.130 --> 00:13:37.713 align:middle line:84%
>>HOFFMAN: In hindsight, a lot
of it was accounting gimmickry.

00:13:37.713 --> 00:13:38.385 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:13:38.385 --> 00:13:39.760 align:middle line:84%
>>HOFFMAN: But
for the most part,

00:13:39.760 --> 00:13:42.280 align:middle line:84%
it was a bubble
that was going on,

00:13:42.280 --> 00:13:44.654 align:middle line:84%
a brief bubble that
peaked and crashed.

00:13:44.654 --> 00:13:45.320 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:13:45.320 --> 00:13:46.986 align:middle line:84%
>>HOFFMAN: And the
same thing was there.

00:13:46.986 --> 00:13:51.200 align:middle line:84%
People saw, after 2008, all that
money printed for five years

00:13:51.200 --> 00:13:52.530 align:middle line:90%
everywhere.

00:13:52.530 --> 00:13:56.185 align:middle line:84%
Pushed stock markets up,
pushed housing prices up,

00:13:56.185 --> 00:13:59.060 align:middle line:84%
and gave people confidence,
especially in China

00:13:59.060 --> 00:14:01.000 align:middle line:84%
where their government
was promoting

00:14:01.000 --> 00:14:02.660 align:middle line:90%
this kind of speculation.

00:14:02.660 --> 00:14:05.010 align:middle line:90%
Whoa, we're past 2008.

00:14:05.010 --> 00:14:06.680 align:middle line:90%
Everything's great now.

00:14:06.680 --> 00:14:09.020 align:middle line:84%
And why not just
build more houses?

00:14:09.020 --> 00:14:10.840 align:middle line:84%
And same thing's
happening here, too.

00:14:10.840 --> 00:14:14.310 align:middle line:84%
Our real estate bubble
was created solely

00:14:14.310 --> 00:14:16.260 align:middle line:84%
with money printed
by the Fed and given

00:14:16.260 --> 00:14:18.615 align:middle line:84%
to private entities
in Wall Street.

00:14:18.615 --> 00:14:20.490 align:middle line:84%
And now that's turning
around and going down.

00:14:20.490 --> 00:14:22.220 align:middle line:84%
Right now, they
just reported we're

00:14:22.220 --> 00:14:25.430 align:middle line:84%
a 20 year low in
mortgage originations.

00:14:25.430 --> 00:14:27.990 align:middle line:90%
Refinancings have collapsed.

00:14:27.990 --> 00:14:29.566 align:middle line:84%
And that's pretty
remarkable given

00:14:29.566 --> 00:14:31.816 align:middle line:84%
that interest rates really
haven't moved up that much.

00:14:31.816 --> 00:14:32.691 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: No, no, no.

00:14:32.691 --> 00:14:33.350 align:middle line:90%
Not at all.

00:14:33.350 --> 00:14:33.850 align:middle line:90%
Right.

00:14:33.850 --> 00:14:36.200 align:middle line:84%
>>HOFFMAN: So it
just shows you how

00:14:36.200 --> 00:14:41.580 align:middle line:84%
limited, the diminishing
returns have become so small

00:14:41.580 --> 00:14:44.520 align:middle line:84%
right now, that they can
print a zillion dollars,

00:14:44.520 --> 00:14:46.620 align:middle line:84%
and it doesn't do
anything anymore,

00:14:46.620 --> 00:14:50.100 align:middle line:84%
except create an
ultimately larger crash.

00:14:50.100 --> 00:14:53.280 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And with China, I'm
always so intrigued with China

00:14:53.280 --> 00:14:57.350 align:middle line:84%
in general because it's
such a different mindset.

00:14:57.350 --> 00:15:00.240 align:middle line:84%
Their population has to
be in decline now, because

00:15:00.240 --> 00:15:03.830 align:middle line:84%
of the practices of
infanticide and so forth.

00:15:03.830 --> 00:15:07.970 align:middle line:84%
And I mean, I know that
there is a ratio that

00:15:07.970 --> 00:15:11.190 align:middle line:84%
is skewing toward males
now as a result of that.

00:15:11.190 --> 00:15:13.290 align:middle line:84%
So what happens in that
country with what's

00:15:13.290 --> 00:15:17.189 align:middle line:84%
going on and a
declining population?

00:15:17.189 --> 00:15:19.730 align:middle line:84%
>>HOFFMAN: Well, you're asking
the right person, since I just

00:15:19.730 --> 00:15:21.642 align:middle line:90%
adopted from China last summer.

00:15:21.642 --> 00:15:22.350 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: A girl.

00:15:22.350 --> 00:15:23.016 align:middle line:90%
>>HOFFMAN: Yeah.

00:15:23.016 --> 00:15:26.335 align:middle line:84%
And actually, I learned quite
a bit about the whole process.

00:15:26.335 --> 00:15:27.460 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Tell us about it.

00:15:27.460 --> 00:15:28.634 align:middle line:90%
It's so intriguing.

00:15:28.634 --> 00:15:30.800 align:middle line:84%
>>HOFFMAN: Well, look, when
we went into the process

00:15:30.800 --> 00:15:34.595 align:middle line:84%
back in 2006-- it was an
18 to 24 month process.

00:15:34.595 --> 00:15:37.880 align:middle line:84%
And it took us seven
and a half years for it

00:15:37.880 --> 00:15:38.990 align:middle line:90%
to actually happen.

00:15:38.990 --> 00:15:43.150 align:middle line:84%
As it turns out, I firmly
believe that our daughter might

00:15:43.150 --> 00:15:47.070 align:middle line:84%
be one of the last healthy
girls to ever leave China,

00:15:47.070 --> 00:15:48.030 align:middle line:90%
and I mean ever.

00:15:48.030 --> 00:15:48.530 align:middle line:90%
Really?

00:15:48.530 --> 00:15:49.190 align:middle line:90%
Why?

00:15:49.190 --> 00:15:50.564 align:middle line:84%
>>HOFFMAN: First
of all, the list

00:15:50.564 --> 00:15:52.347 align:middle line:84%
had been slowing down
so much, I couldn't

00:15:52.347 --> 00:15:53.590 align:middle line:90%
believe it even happened.

00:15:53.590 --> 00:15:56.860 align:middle line:84%
But since we got her,
in July of last year,

00:15:56.860 --> 00:15:58.710 align:middle line:90%
the list hasn't moved at all.

00:15:58.710 --> 00:16:02.059 align:middle line:84%
And when we were in China,
she was the only healthy girl

00:16:02.059 --> 00:16:03.350 align:middle line:90%
of any the people we were with.

00:16:03.350 --> 00:16:04.058 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Really?

00:16:04.058 --> 00:16:06.940 align:middle line:84%
>>HOFFMAN: Everyone was what
they called special needs that

00:16:06.940 --> 00:16:09.780 align:middle line:84%
had some kind of sickness
or illness or disability.

00:16:09.780 --> 00:16:11.404 align:middle line:84%
So they are no longer
allowing children

00:16:11.404 --> 00:16:15.060 align:middle line:84%
to leave-- healthy children
to leave the country.

00:16:15.060 --> 00:16:18.260 align:middle line:84%
And on top of that,
the girls are now more

00:16:18.260 --> 00:16:19.260 align:middle line:90%
valued than the boys.

00:16:19.260 --> 00:16:19.885 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:16:19.885 --> 00:16:22.750 align:middle line:84%
>>HOFFMAN: One, because
of the demographics

00:16:22.750 --> 00:16:24.050 align:middle line:90%
from the government standpoint.

00:16:24.050 --> 00:16:25.424 align:middle line:84%
But from the
people's standpoint,

00:16:25.424 --> 00:16:27.720 align:middle line:84%
it's not as agrarian a
culture as it used to be.

00:16:27.720 --> 00:16:29.280 align:middle line:90%
It's not everyone's a farmer.

00:16:29.280 --> 00:16:30.590 align:middle line:90%
Everyone's moved to the cities.

00:16:30.590 --> 00:16:32.900 align:middle line:84%
And as it turns
out, the boys have

00:16:32.900 --> 00:16:34.780 align:middle line:90%
been taught to spend money.

00:16:34.780 --> 00:16:37.580 align:middle line:84%
And the girls have been
taught to save money.

00:16:37.580 --> 00:16:40.040 align:middle line:84%
So as it turns out, girls are
now more valuable than boys

00:16:40.040 --> 00:16:40.650 align:middle line:90%
by far.

00:16:40.650 --> 00:16:41.397 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Whoa.

00:16:41.397 --> 00:16:42.730 align:middle line:90%
So this is a total switch-a-roo.

00:16:42.730 --> 00:16:43.396 align:middle line:90%
>>HOFFMAN: Yeah.

00:16:43.396 --> 00:16:45.710 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And we had some
Chinese girls at our house

00:16:45.710 --> 00:16:47.414 align:middle line:90%
recently over from Beijing.

00:16:47.414 --> 00:16:48.580 align:middle line:90%
And we were talking to them.

00:16:48.580 --> 00:16:53.250 align:middle line:84%
And they said the government
was now even allowing-- permits

00:16:53.250 --> 00:16:54.730 align:middle line:90%
to have a second child.

00:16:54.730 --> 00:16:58.629 align:middle line:84%
But she said that
the equivalent-- she

00:16:58.629 --> 00:16:59.295 align:middle line:90%
was calculating.

00:16:59.295 --> 00:17:00.170 align:middle line:90%
>>HOFFMAN: For money.

00:17:00.170 --> 00:17:05.672 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: For money, was about
$60,000 to have a second child.

00:17:05.672 --> 00:17:07.380 align:middle line:84%
>>HOFFMAN: They've
essentially gotten rid

00:17:07.380 --> 00:17:08.940 align:middle line:90%
of the one child policy.

00:17:08.940 --> 00:17:10.440 align:middle line:84%
In fact, they just
had their meeting

00:17:10.440 --> 00:17:13.160 align:middle line:84%
called the third plenum
or the fifth plenum.

00:17:13.160 --> 00:17:16.310 align:middle line:84%
It's where they have these
giant government meetings, where

00:17:16.310 --> 00:17:19.200 align:middle line:84%
every aspect of government
meets every couple of years

00:17:19.200 --> 00:17:21.790 align:middle line:84%
and discusses every
vital topic And they just

00:17:21.790 --> 00:17:23.469 align:middle line:90%
had one maybe six months ago.

00:17:23.469 --> 00:17:24.010 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: OK.

00:17:24.010 --> 00:17:24.880 align:middle line:90%
So it changed then?

00:17:24.880 --> 00:17:26.390 align:middle line:84%
>>HOFFMAN: They
essentially, even

00:17:26.390 --> 00:17:29.170 align:middle line:84%
though just from our experience
it was pretty clear that it

00:17:29.170 --> 00:17:31.240 align:middle line:84%
was on the way out,
it really started

00:17:31.240 --> 00:17:34.060 align:middle line:84%
at the time of the Olympics is
when we saw the list slow down.

00:17:34.060 --> 00:17:36.762 align:middle line:84%
And I think part of that
was political in nature.

00:17:36.762 --> 00:17:38.220 align:middle line:84%
They're like, we
don't want to look

00:17:38.220 --> 00:17:39.580 align:middle line:84%
like we're giving
our children away

00:17:39.580 --> 00:17:41.210 align:middle line:84%
while the we're the
focus of the world.

00:17:41.210 --> 00:17:43.270 align:middle line:90%
But it's only gotten more so.

00:17:43.270 --> 00:17:47.280 align:middle line:84%
And at this fifth plenum,
whatever it's called,

00:17:47.280 --> 00:17:49.430 align:middle line:84%
they've essentially
gotten rid of the policy.

00:17:49.430 --> 00:17:53.840 align:middle line:84%
They've for some time now
allowed families within China

00:17:53.840 --> 00:17:58.517 align:middle line:84%
to adopt a second child,
which means there're not

00:17:58.517 --> 00:18:00.850 align:middle line:84%
as many being born, but they're
not leaving the country.

00:18:00.850 --> 00:18:02.975 align:middle line:84%
Because as you said, they
don't want the population

00:18:02.975 --> 00:18:03.980 align:middle line:90%
to decline too much.

00:18:03.980 --> 00:18:05.990 align:middle line:84%
And they also need to have
more girls in the country.

00:18:05.990 --> 00:18:06.656 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:18:06.656 --> 00:18:11.290 align:middle line:84%
>>HOFFMAN: And also on
top of that, you can buy.

00:18:11.290 --> 00:18:13.580 align:middle line:84%
I've heard it was more
like $10,000 or $20,000.

00:18:13.580 --> 00:18:15.390 align:middle line:84%
But $10,000 or
$20,000 in China--

00:18:15.390 --> 00:18:16.450 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Oh, that's a
huge amount of money.

00:18:16.450 --> 00:18:17.366 align:middle line:90%
>>HOFFMAN: --is a lot.

00:18:17.366 --> 00:18:20.084 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: When she said $60,000,
I said, dollars or yuan?

00:18:20.084 --> 00:18:20.750 align:middle line:90%
>>HOFFMAN: Yeah.

00:18:20.750 --> 00:18:21.400 align:middle line:90%
It's dollars.

00:18:21.400 --> 00:18:24.760 align:middle line:84%
But $10,000 is a lot
of money in China.

00:18:24.760 --> 00:18:26.190 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: That's a lot of money.

00:18:26.190 --> 00:18:27.920 align:middle line:84%
>>HOFFMAN: It's probably
10 times that here.

00:18:27.920 --> 00:18:28.586 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:18:28.586 --> 00:18:30.910 align:middle line:84%
>>HOFFMAN: And not many
people can afford $100,000.

00:18:30.910 --> 00:18:31.576 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:18:31.576 --> 00:18:34.470 align:middle line:84%
>>HOFFMAN: But you know,
they need the girls.

00:18:34.470 --> 00:18:37.900 align:middle line:84%
And they need to correct
the demographics.

00:18:37.900 --> 00:18:40.790 align:middle line:84%
But they have said
that they believe

00:18:40.790 --> 00:18:43.827 align:middle line:84%
that there are 300 million
less people in China because

00:18:43.827 --> 00:18:44.410 align:middle line:90%
of doing this.

00:18:44.410 --> 00:18:45.130 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

00:18:45.130 --> 00:18:46.960 align:middle line:84%
>>HOFFMAN: I mean,
that's a good thing.

00:18:46.960 --> 00:18:49.120 align:middle line:84%
Like I said, there's
7 billion people.

00:18:49.120 --> 00:18:51.295 align:middle line:84%
I believe India's probably
larger than China.

00:18:51.295 --> 00:18:52.160 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:18:52.160 --> 00:18:53.160 align:middle line:90%
So many mouths to feed.

00:18:53.160 --> 00:18:53.760 align:middle line:84%
>>HOFFMAN: The Middle
East is growing.

00:18:53.760 --> 00:18:55.218 align:middle line:84%
The Middle East is
having-- I think

00:18:55.218 --> 00:18:57.420 align:middle line:84%
the average woman has
six or seven children.

00:18:57.420 --> 00:18:59.031 align:middle line:84%
So for all we know,
50 years from now,

00:18:59.031 --> 00:19:01.530 align:middle line:84%
the Middle East will be the
next China as far as population.

00:19:01.530 --> 00:19:01.790 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:19:01.790 --> 00:19:02.160 align:middle line:90%
Interesting.

00:19:02.160 --> 00:19:03.360 align:middle line:84%
>>HOFFMAN: There's
just too many people.

00:19:03.360 --> 00:19:05.100 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And meanwhile, you
have a beautiful little baby

00:19:05.100 --> 00:19:06.340 align:middle line:90%
girl that you get to love.

00:19:06.340 --> 00:19:07.280 align:middle line:90%
>>HOFFMAN: Yes.

00:19:07.280 --> 00:19:08.130 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: I know you adore her.

00:19:08.130 --> 00:19:09.640 align:middle line:84%
>>HOFFMAN: It
really is remarkable

00:19:09.640 --> 00:19:11.680 align:middle line:90%
how it worked out for us.

00:19:11.680 --> 00:19:15.176 align:middle line:84%
Because she is, so
far, a blessing.

00:19:15.176 --> 00:19:16.520 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: I know.

00:19:16.520 --> 00:19:18.370 align:middle line:90%
Silvie, the light of your life.

00:19:18.370 --> 00:19:19.150 align:middle line:90%
>>HOFFMAN: Yeah.

00:19:19.150 --> 00:19:19.691 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: OK.

00:19:19.691 --> 00:19:23.507 align:middle line:84%
So let's see, anything else on
China before we go to Japan?

00:19:23.507 --> 00:19:24.090 align:middle line:90%
>>HOFFMAN: No.

00:19:24.090 --> 00:19:25.180 align:middle line:90%
We got a lot to talk about.

00:19:25.180 --> 00:19:26.180 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: OK, all right.

00:19:26.180 --> 00:19:29.496 align:middle line:84%
So Japan, you talk about-- is
called eb-onom-- eb--onomics?

00:19:29.496 --> 00:19:30.370 align:middle line:90%
>>HOFFMAN: Abenomics.

00:19:30.370 --> 00:19:31.280 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Abenomics.

00:19:31.280 --> 00:19:33.077 align:middle line:90%
What is Abenomics?

00:19:33.077 --> 00:19:33.660 align:middle line:90%
>>HOFFMAN: OK.

00:19:33.660 --> 00:19:36.660 align:middle line:84%
So Japan is the land
of the rising sun,

00:19:36.660 --> 00:19:37.910 align:middle line:90%
right, historically?

00:19:37.910 --> 00:19:39.680 align:middle line:84%
I call it the land
of the setting sun.

00:19:39.680 --> 00:19:42.580 align:middle line:84%
And I don't do it--
it's not funny.

00:19:42.580 --> 00:19:46.210 align:middle line:84%
But economically, they are
falling into the ocean.

00:19:46.210 --> 00:19:48.460 align:middle line:84%
I mean, they have a
long troubled history

00:19:48.460 --> 00:19:51.030 align:middle line:90%
of natural disasters.

00:19:51.030 --> 00:19:54.940 align:middle line:90%
So it's not uncommon.

00:19:54.940 --> 00:19:57.240 align:middle line:10%
That the fact that the
tsunami, and earthquake,

00:19:57.240 --> 00:19:59.370 align:middle line:10%
and the nuclear
disaster, the fact

00:19:59.370 --> 00:20:00.990 align:middle line:10%
that it's coming
just at the time

00:20:00.990 --> 00:20:04.180 align:middle line:10%
that Japan's economy
is falling apart

00:20:04.180 --> 00:20:06.990 align:middle line:10%
is no coincidence in my opinion.

00:20:06.990 --> 00:20:09.860 align:middle line:10%
Abenomics is named
after Shinzo Abe.

00:20:09.860 --> 00:20:11.140 align:middle line:10%
He is the Prime Minister.

00:20:11.140 --> 00:20:13.950 align:middle line:10%
He's been there for
about two years now.

00:20:13.950 --> 00:20:15.690 align:middle line:10%
And he made it under a policy--

00:20:15.690 --> 00:20:17.809 align:middle line:10%
He got in under
a platform of I'm

00:20:17.809 --> 00:20:19.100 align:middle line:10%
going to print even more money.

00:20:19.100 --> 00:20:22.100 align:middle line:10%
Remember, he was already
the Prime Minister in 2006

00:20:22.100 --> 00:20:24.810 align:middle line:10%
and '07 under that
same platform.

00:20:24.810 --> 00:20:25.740 align:middle line:10%
But it didn't work.

00:20:25.740 --> 00:20:25.840 align:middle line:10%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:20:25.840 --> 00:20:27.720 align:middle line:10%
>>HOFFMAN: So now he's
just doing it more.

00:20:27.720 --> 00:20:31.860 align:middle line:10%
Remember, Japan, they have
what I call demographic hell.

00:20:31.860 --> 00:20:33.260 align:middle line:10%
It was a piece I wrote.

00:20:33.260 --> 00:20:35.020 align:middle line:84%
They are the oldest
nation in the world.

00:20:35.020 --> 00:20:36.740 align:middle line:84%
In fact, the only
nation that's older--

00:20:36.740 --> 00:20:38.637 align:middle line:90%
I take it back-- is Monaco.

00:20:38.637 --> 00:20:39.970 align:middle line:90%
There's barely any people there.

00:20:39.970 --> 00:20:42.486 align:middle line:84%
And it's just old people
going to save on taxes.

00:20:42.486 --> 00:20:43.235 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Casinos.

00:20:43.235 --> 00:20:44.484 align:middle line:90%
>>HOFFMAN: That kind of thing.

00:20:44.484 --> 00:20:45.980 align:middle line:90%
But they are by far the oldest.

00:20:45.980 --> 00:20:49.260 align:middle line:84%
Their population is 10
years older than hours.

00:20:49.260 --> 00:20:51.080 align:middle line:84%
I think the average
person is in their mid

00:20:51.080 --> 00:20:55.129 align:middle line:84%
to late 40s, which is incredible
for a first world nation.

00:20:55.129 --> 00:20:56.420 align:middle line:90%
Because you need young people--

00:20:56.420 --> 00:20:57.086 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:20:57.086 --> 00:20:58.690 align:middle line:90%
>>HOFFMAN: --to grow it.

00:20:58.690 --> 00:21:04.790 align:middle line:84%
So they experienced their money
printing bubble and bust 10

00:21:04.790 --> 00:21:06.697 align:middle line:90%
years before ours, 1989.

00:21:06.697 --> 00:21:07.530 align:middle line:90%
It's the same thing.

00:21:07.530 --> 00:21:10.480 align:middle line:10%
We're all in the fiat currency
system, same life cycle.

00:21:10.480 --> 00:21:12.710 align:middle line:10%
Everything happened
10 years earlier.

00:21:12.710 --> 00:21:15.309 align:middle line:10%
They had their 2000 in 1989.

00:21:15.309 --> 00:21:16.850 align:middle line:10%
And they've been
printing ever since.

00:21:16.850 --> 00:21:19.750 align:middle line:10%
So they've been the poster child
of what the rest of the world

00:21:19.750 --> 00:21:22.680 align:middle line:10%
will do, assuming the rest of
the world's financial system

00:21:22.680 --> 00:21:24.930 align:middle line:10%
holds up for another 10 years.

00:21:24.930 --> 00:21:28.140 align:middle line:84%
So they have the highest
debt in the world.

00:21:28.140 --> 00:21:30.470 align:middle line:84%
Tokyo has been the
most expensive city

00:21:30.470 --> 00:21:32.240 align:middle line:84%
in the world for
the past 15 years.

00:21:32.240 --> 00:21:32.960 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:21:32.960 --> 00:21:34.376 align:middle line:84%
>>HOFFMAN: And
yet, the propaganda

00:21:34.376 --> 00:21:36.202 align:middle line:84%
that comes out of
Japan is deflation,

00:21:36.202 --> 00:21:37.535 align:middle line:90%
which we've talked about before.

00:21:37.535 --> 00:21:38.201 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:21:38.201 --> 00:21:40.400 align:middle line:84%
>>HOFFMAN: They constantly
say deflation, deflation,

00:21:40.400 --> 00:21:42.830 align:middle line:90%
deflation.

00:21:42.830 --> 00:21:44.360 align:middle line:90%
It's a misnomer to start with.

00:21:44.360 --> 00:21:46.040 align:middle line:84%
Because deflation
means a contraction

00:21:46.040 --> 00:21:48.400 align:middle line:84%
of the money supply,
which certainly has never

00:21:48.400 --> 00:21:51.100 align:middle line:84%
happened in Japan and can never
happen under any fiat currency

00:21:51.100 --> 00:21:51.480 align:middle line:90%
system.

00:21:51.480 --> 00:21:52.000 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:21:52.000 --> 00:21:53.800 align:middle line:84%
>>HOFFMAN: And the
fact is, again, things

00:21:53.800 --> 00:21:54.980 align:middle line:90%
you want versus need.

00:21:54.980 --> 00:21:57.840 align:middle line:84%
Yes, they would love to
have their housing bubble

00:21:57.840 --> 00:22:00.540 align:middle line:90%
reflate to where it was in 1989.

00:22:00.540 --> 00:22:04.160 align:middle line:84%
It's about 70% lower
than it was from 1989.

00:22:04.160 --> 00:22:06.160 align:middle line:84%
So they say we have
deflation in the nation,

00:22:06.160 --> 00:22:09.630 align:middle line:84%
because their housing
bubble hasn't gone up again.

00:22:09.630 --> 00:22:13.330 align:middle line:84%
But the fact is that their food
prices, their energy prices,

00:22:13.330 --> 00:22:15.490 align:middle line:90%
are at record highs and soaring.

00:22:15.490 --> 00:22:21.200 align:middle line:84%
And when Shinzo Abe came into
office in December of 2012,

00:22:21.200 --> 00:22:23.230 align:middle line:84%
he immediately
instituted what is now

00:22:23.230 --> 00:22:28.320 align:middle line:84%
called Abenomics, which was
after 10 or 15 rounds of QE,

00:22:28.320 --> 00:22:31.290 align:middle line:84%
to double the money supply
in a two year period.

00:22:31.290 --> 00:22:34.240 align:middle line:84%
That started a year
ago in April 2013.

00:22:34.240 --> 00:22:36.420 align:middle line:90%
So here we are a year into it.

00:22:36.420 --> 00:22:39.700 align:middle line:84%
They just announced last
week a five year high

00:22:39.700 --> 00:22:45.300 align:middle line:84%
in their massaged, lower, CPI,
a nearly all-time high in energy

00:22:45.300 --> 00:22:48.390 align:middle line:84%
prices, nearly all-time
high in food prices.

00:22:48.390 --> 00:22:50.830 align:middle line:84%
Wages in Japan,
labor wages, have

00:22:50.830 --> 00:22:53.620 align:middle line:84%
fallen for 21 straight
months right now.

00:22:53.620 --> 00:22:55.370 align:middle line:90%
And GDP was zero.

00:22:55.370 --> 00:23:00.000 align:middle line:84%
And on top of that, when he
announced Abenomics a year ago,

00:23:00.000 --> 00:23:02.000 align:middle line:84%
he said part of
the way we're going

00:23:02.000 --> 00:23:06.250 align:middle line:84%
to pay for this program
is by instituting

00:23:06.250 --> 00:23:07.967 align:middle line:84%
an increase in the
national sales tax.

00:23:07.967 --> 00:23:08.550 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:23:08.550 --> 00:23:10.300 align:middle line:90%
I mean, that's severe.

00:23:10.300 --> 00:23:13.117 align:middle line:84%
What was the sales tax,
say, 10 years ago in Japan?

00:23:13.117 --> 00:23:14.700 align:middle line:84%
>>HOFFMAN: Well,
I'll put it this way.

00:23:14.700 --> 00:23:16.750 align:middle line:84%
They instituted a
sales tax increase

00:23:16.750 --> 00:23:21.560 align:middle line:84%
in 1997, which then was
high-times for the world,

00:23:21.560 --> 00:23:23.524 align:middle line:84%
literally the peak
of the world economy.

00:23:23.524 --> 00:23:24.190 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:23:24.190 --> 00:23:26.840 align:middle line:84%
>>HOFFMAN: They went
from 2% to 5% then.

00:23:26.840 --> 00:23:29.480 align:middle line:84%
And Japan, while the
world was doing great--

00:23:29.480 --> 00:23:32.710 align:middle line:84%
it was fake great, but it
was great-- had a two year

00:23:32.710 --> 00:23:34.290 align:middle line:90%
recession as a result.

00:23:34.290 --> 00:23:36.940 align:middle line:84%
Now, with Japan
already collapsing

00:23:36.940 --> 00:23:39.680 align:middle line:84%
and the rest of the global
economy collapsing--

00:23:39.680 --> 00:23:41.580 align:middle line:84%
you like to talk about
the Baltic Dry Index,

00:23:41.580 --> 00:23:43.720 align:middle line:84%
it's had its worst
start to a year ever.

00:23:43.720 --> 00:23:43.920 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Oh, yeah.

00:23:43.920 --> 00:23:44.521 align:middle line:90%
We're going to talk about that.

00:23:44.521 --> 00:23:45.780 align:middle line:84%
Let's talk about
that in a minute.

00:23:45.780 --> 00:23:46.170 align:middle line:90%
>>HOFFMAN: OK.

00:23:46.170 --> 00:23:46.850 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: OK.

00:23:46.850 --> 00:23:49.240 align:middle line:84%
>>HOFFMAN: Now, with
this, they just raised it,

00:23:49.240 --> 00:23:53.140 align:middle line:84%
starting April 1-- meaning
last week-- from 5% to 8%.

00:23:53.140 --> 00:23:56.266 align:middle line:84%
And on top of that, next October
it's going to go up to 10%.

00:23:56.266 --> 00:23:57.390 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Double in a year.

00:23:57.390 --> 00:24:01.290 align:middle line:84%
>>HOFFMAN: And at
least, in 1996, '97,

00:24:01.290 --> 00:24:04.580 align:middle line:84%
going into that
sales tax increase,

00:24:04.580 --> 00:24:06.515 align:middle line:84%
there was a big
jump in spending.

00:24:06.515 --> 00:24:08.640 align:middle line:84%
People said I got to buy
stuff before they do this.

00:24:08.640 --> 00:24:09.050 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Before
it goes up, yeah.

00:24:09.050 --> 00:24:10.966 align:middle line:84%
>>HOFFMAN: Well, you
know what's happened now?

00:24:10.966 --> 00:24:14.882 align:middle line:84%
It's completely crashed consumer
spending going into this.

00:24:14.882 --> 00:24:16.590 align:middle line:84%
And actually, I just
read an article that

00:24:16.590 --> 00:24:20.060 align:middle line:84%
says the number one department
store chain in Japan

00:24:20.060 --> 00:24:21.810 align:middle line:84%
this week, because
it's been one week,

00:24:21.810 --> 00:24:25.470 align:middle line:84%
has had a 25% drop in
sales because of this.

00:24:25.470 --> 00:24:26.330 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: 25%.

00:24:26.330 --> 00:24:28.900 align:middle line:84%
>>HOFFMAN: So my
belief, firmly, is

00:24:28.900 --> 00:24:31.880 align:middle line:84%
that Abenomics is scheduled
to go on for another year.

00:24:31.880 --> 00:24:34.350 align:middle line:84%
I believe they're going to
increase it before then.

00:24:34.350 --> 00:24:38.200 align:middle line:84%
And I hold that Japan will
be the first first world

00:24:38.200 --> 00:24:40.650 align:middle line:84%
nation to experience
hyperinflation

00:24:40.650 --> 00:24:42.752 align:middle line:90%
in the 21st century.

00:24:42.752 --> 00:24:44.710 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: You know, one
of the things about-- I

00:24:44.710 --> 00:24:46.543 align:middle line:84%
want to go back to sales
tax, what that does

00:24:46.543 --> 00:24:49.781 align:middle line:84%
to exports and abroad and so
forth, with Japanese products

00:24:49.781 --> 00:24:50.280 align:middle line:90%
as well.

00:24:50.280 --> 00:24:51.250 align:middle line:84%
I don't know if it
affects anything.

00:24:51.250 --> 00:24:52.430 align:middle line:84%
>>HOFFMAN: Remember, part
of what they're doing

00:24:52.430 --> 00:24:53.971 align:middle line:84%
is they're trying
to devalue the yen.

00:24:53.971 --> 00:24:55.415 align:middle line:90%
That's what it's all about.

00:24:55.415 --> 00:24:56.290 align:middle line:90%
For the same reason--

00:24:56.290 --> 00:24:58.660 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: To keep themselves
viable in the market abroad?

00:24:58.660 --> 00:24:59.326 align:middle line:90%
>>HOFFMAN: Yeah.

00:24:59.326 --> 00:25:01.480 align:middle line:84%
Of course, again,
it's a misnomer

00:25:01.480 --> 00:25:03.760 align:middle line:84%
that getting those
jobs is a positive.

00:25:03.760 --> 00:25:06.110 align:middle line:84%
Because, yes, I
suppose Toyota will not

00:25:06.110 --> 00:25:08.450 align:middle line:84%
fire people if they
get more sales.

00:25:08.450 --> 00:25:11.890 align:middle line:84%
The problem is the money
that they earn is worth less.

00:25:11.890 --> 00:25:14.520 align:middle line:84%
So for the people who are
getting paid that money,

00:25:14.520 --> 00:25:16.160 align:middle line:84%
it doesn't really
help them that much.

00:25:16.160 --> 00:25:16.360 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:25:16.360 --> 00:25:18.380 align:middle line:84%
>>HOFFMAN: But from a
political standpoint,

00:25:18.380 --> 00:25:20.110 align:middle line:84%
they want to say
we're creating jobs,

00:25:20.110 --> 00:25:22.670 align:middle line:84%
so they continue
to devalue the yen.

00:25:22.670 --> 00:25:26.700 align:middle line:84%
I mean, they will say outright
our goal is to devalue the yen.

00:25:26.700 --> 00:25:30.510 align:middle line:84%
That, of course, pisses off the
Chinese, who devalue the yuan.

00:25:30.510 --> 00:25:31.190 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:25:31.190 --> 00:25:33.900 align:middle line:84%
>>HOFFMAN: You see all
these territorial disputes

00:25:33.900 --> 00:25:36.400 align:middle line:90%
they're having between the two.

00:25:36.400 --> 00:25:38.515 align:middle line:84%
It has nothing to do
with those territories.

00:25:38.515 --> 00:25:41.700 align:middle line:84%
It has to do with the anger over
what both countries are doing

00:25:41.700 --> 00:25:43.416 align:middle line:84%
to each other right
now economically.

00:25:43.416 --> 00:25:45.790 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: It's so interesting
because-- now, this is just

00:25:45.790 --> 00:25:49.720 align:middle line:84%
my naive point of view-- it
seems that both countries are

00:25:49.720 --> 00:25:53.640 align:middle line:84%
very tempered in a lot of ways
and have long term strategies

00:25:53.640 --> 00:25:57.220 align:middle line:84%
and use logic in the way they
structure their societies

00:25:57.220 --> 00:25:58.130 align:middle line:90%
and so forth.

00:25:58.130 --> 00:26:00.200 align:middle line:84%
But when it comes to
the world of economics,

00:26:00.200 --> 00:26:03.980 align:middle line:84%
it seems as though all logic,
everything that would normally

00:26:03.980 --> 00:26:06.570 align:middle line:84%
display itself in society
is thrown out the window.

00:26:06.570 --> 00:26:07.690 align:middle line:90%
And this is true globally.

00:26:07.690 --> 00:26:10.040 align:middle line:84%
But I mean, it's more
interesting to me

00:26:10.040 --> 00:26:11.460 align:middle line:90%
that it's happening in the East.

00:26:11.460 --> 00:26:13.440 align:middle line:84%
>>HOFFMAN: Well, Japan, is--
and, again, I don't even

00:26:13.440 --> 00:26:15.800 align:middle line:84%
know whether to use the word
capitalism anymore anywhere.

00:26:15.800 --> 00:26:17.341 align:middle line:84%
Because so many of
the things they're

00:26:17.341 --> 00:26:18.950 align:middle line:90%
doing are not capitalistic.

00:26:18.950 --> 00:26:22.110 align:middle line:84%
Just like there's almost
nothing capitalistic

00:26:22.110 --> 00:26:23.530 align:middle line:90%
left about America.

00:26:23.530 --> 00:26:25.170 align:middle line:90%
It's a couple of corporations.

00:26:25.170 --> 00:26:28.440 align:middle line:84%
It's what they call fascism,
where the government is

00:26:28.440 --> 00:26:29.940 align:middle line:84%
in bed with the
biggest corporation.

00:26:29.940 --> 00:26:30.830 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Corporatocracy--

00:26:30.830 --> 00:26:31.210 align:middle line:90%
>>HOFFMAN: Yeah.

00:26:31.210 --> 00:26:31.970 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: --in John
Perkin's terminology.

00:26:31.970 --> 00:26:34.386 align:middle line:84%
>>HOFFMAN: And then we have
the socialism thrown in there.

00:26:34.386 --> 00:26:37.060 align:middle line:84%
So who's doing anything
that's truly capitalistic?

00:26:37.060 --> 00:26:37.720 align:middle line:90%
But, yes.

00:26:37.720 --> 00:26:41.627 align:middle line:84%
Japan was certainly a model of
planning from a capitalistic--

00:26:41.627 --> 00:26:42.210 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:26:42.210 --> 00:26:43.668 align:middle line:84%
>>HOFFMAN: --standpoint
for a time.

00:26:43.668 --> 00:26:45.770 align:middle line:84%
Until, of course,
their market crashed

00:26:45.770 --> 00:26:47.760 align:middle line:84%
and the demographics
hit, in which case

00:26:47.760 --> 00:26:50.520 align:middle line:84%
they're turning into
a model of socialism.

00:26:50.520 --> 00:26:54.030 align:middle line:84%
And they're starting to do
incredibly non-capitalistic

00:26:54.030 --> 00:26:55.180 align:middle line:90%
business things.

00:26:55.180 --> 00:26:57.504 align:middle line:84%
Now, China's always
been communist--

00:26:57.504 --> 00:26:58.170 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:26:58.170 --> 00:26:59.836 align:middle line:84%
>>HOFFMAN: --in every
way shape or form.

00:26:59.836 --> 00:27:01.970 align:middle line:84%
And frankly, they
have to in some ways

00:27:01.970 --> 00:27:03.530 align:middle line:84%
because they have
so many people.

00:27:03.530 --> 00:27:03.810 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:27:03.810 --> 00:27:06.440 align:middle line:84%
>>HOFFMAN: There's not going
to be 1.5 billion jobs in China

00:27:06.440 --> 00:27:07.560 align:middle line:90%
no matter what they do.

00:27:07.560 --> 00:27:08.350 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:27:08.350 --> 00:27:08.710 align:middle line:90%
It makes sense, sure.

00:27:08.710 --> 00:27:10.209 align:middle line:84%
>>HOFFMAN: But of
course, it creates

00:27:10.209 --> 00:27:11.720 align:middle line:90%
the same kind of problems.

00:27:11.720 --> 00:27:15.122 align:middle line:84%
They don't have a
wealth of resources

00:27:15.122 --> 00:27:16.330 align:middle line:90%
like some other countries do.

00:27:16.330 --> 00:27:18.470 align:middle line:84%
So they're going
to have to continue

00:27:18.470 --> 00:27:21.730 align:middle line:84%
to find ways to get those
resources into the country.

00:27:21.730 --> 00:27:24.340 align:middle line:84%
And printing money to do
that creates inflation.

00:27:24.340 --> 00:27:25.770 align:middle line:90%
And it's just a vicious loop.

00:27:25.770 --> 00:27:29.190 align:middle line:84%
So the point is they all
have long term hopes.

00:27:29.190 --> 00:27:32.672 align:middle line:84%
But right now,
nothing is working.

00:27:32.672 --> 00:27:33.880 align:middle line:90%
At least they're buying gold.

00:27:33.880 --> 00:27:35.810 align:middle line:84%
They know we have to
get rid of our reserves.

00:27:35.810 --> 00:27:36.430 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Yeah, they're
buying a lot of gold.

00:27:36.430 --> 00:27:37.846 align:middle line:84%
>>HOFFMAN: So
they're buying gold.

00:27:37.846 --> 00:27:40.090 align:middle line:84%
Because in the next
version, when we finally

00:27:40.090 --> 00:27:42.860 align:middle line:84%
go back to a gold
standard, which

00:27:42.860 --> 00:27:44.590 align:middle line:84%
is the only type of
money that works--

00:27:44.590 --> 00:27:45.320 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:27:45.320 --> 00:27:46.850 align:middle line:84%
>>HOFFMAN: He who
has the gold wins.

00:27:46.850 --> 00:27:47.140 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:27:47.140 --> 00:27:48.830 align:middle line:84%
>>HOFFMAN: It you will be
the Chinese, the Russians.

00:27:48.830 --> 00:27:51.377 align:middle line:84%
The problem is for people
who think-- a lot of people

00:27:51.377 --> 00:27:53.210 align:middle line:84%
say, well, the Chinese,
they're being smart.

00:27:53.210 --> 00:27:55.210 align:middle line:84%
They're buying up all
this gold, because they're

00:27:55.210 --> 00:27:56.627 align:middle line:84%
going to convert
the yuan to gold.

00:27:56.627 --> 00:27:57.543 align:middle line:90%
And it'll be all good.

00:27:57.543 --> 00:27:58.060 align:middle line:90%
No, no.

00:27:58.060 --> 00:28:00.700 align:middle line:84%
China's economy is going
to crash, as I said,

00:28:00.700 --> 00:28:02.100 align:middle line:90%
harder than any of them.

00:28:02.100 --> 00:28:06.060 align:middle line:84%
And the Chinese government
that benefits from the gold

00:28:06.060 --> 00:28:08.000 align:middle line:84%
backed yuan being
reserved currency

00:28:08.000 --> 00:28:09.997 align:middle line:90%
will not be any of these guys.

00:28:09.997 --> 00:28:11.580 align:middle line:84%
These guys want to
protect their jobs.

00:28:11.580 --> 00:28:12.227 align:middle line:90%
But they won't.

00:28:12.227 --> 00:28:13.060 align:middle line:90%
It'll be new people.

00:28:13.060 --> 00:28:15.572 align:middle line:84%
So it's not like they're
looking out for the future.

00:28:15.572 --> 00:28:17.030 align:middle line:84%
They're looking
out for themselves.

00:28:17.030 --> 00:28:17.904 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Absolutely.

00:28:17.904 --> 00:28:19.080 align:middle line:90%
Well, that's true globally.

00:28:19.080 --> 00:28:19.680 align:middle line:90%
>>HOFFMAN: Absolutely.

00:28:19.680 --> 00:28:22.020 align:middle line:10%
It's no different than
what happens with the Obama

00:28:22.020 --> 00:28:25.030 align:middle line:10%
administration, the Bush
administration before it,

00:28:25.030 --> 00:28:27.630 align:middle line:10%
the coming Clinton
administration, the coming Bush

00:28:27.630 --> 00:28:31.474 align:middle line:10%
administration, the coming
Clinton administration.

00:28:31.474 --> 00:28:32.390 align:middle line:90%
See, I'm reading that.

00:28:32.390 --> 00:28:34.985 align:middle line:84%
And it looks like it might
be Clinton against Bush.

00:28:34.985 --> 00:28:35.860 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Oh, I know.

00:28:35.860 --> 00:28:37.090 align:middle line:90%
Again.

00:28:37.090 --> 00:28:37.980 align:middle line:90%
Heaven forbid.

00:28:37.980 --> 00:28:39.099 align:middle line:90%
>>HOFFMAN: Yeah.

00:28:39.099 --> 00:28:39.640 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: OK.

00:28:39.640 --> 00:28:41.670 align:middle line:90%
So let's see.

00:28:41.670 --> 00:28:43.654 align:middle line:84%
Japan, I think
that's kind of where

00:28:43.654 --> 00:28:44.820 align:middle line:90%
we were going to go on that.

00:28:44.820 --> 00:28:47.030 align:middle line:84%
And then Europe, we
wanted to go to Europe.

00:28:47.030 --> 00:28:49.385 align:middle line:90%
Oh, no, the Baltic Dry Index.

00:28:49.385 --> 00:28:50.220 align:middle line:90%
>>HOFFMAN: OK.

00:28:50.220 --> 00:28:51.720 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: I want
to talk about that.

00:28:51.720 --> 00:28:54.780 align:middle line:84%
Because to me, that's one of
those really kind of basic meat

00:28:54.780 --> 00:28:56.006 align:middle line:90%
and potatoes indicators.

00:28:56.006 --> 00:28:56.714 align:middle line:90%
>>HOFFMAN: Right.

00:28:56.714 --> 00:28:58.110 align:middle line:84%
And we've talked
about it before.

00:28:58.110 --> 00:28:58.160 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:28:58.160 --> 00:28:59.660 align:middle line:84%
>>HOFFMAN: It's
kind of a follow up.

00:28:59.660 --> 00:29:02.590 align:middle line:84%
And again, I caveat anything
with the Baltic Dry Index

00:29:02.590 --> 00:29:04.370 align:middle line:84%
with there are two
components of it.

00:29:04.370 --> 00:29:05.924 align:middle line:90%
One is the actual demand.

00:29:05.924 --> 00:29:08.090 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Well, explain
what it is again for people.

00:29:08.090 --> 00:29:09.590 align:middle line:84%
>>HOFFMAN: The
Baltic Dry Index is--

00:29:09.590 --> 00:29:11.267 align:middle line:84%
and again, I'm not
an expert on this.

00:29:11.267 --> 00:29:11.850 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:29:11.850 --> 00:29:13.225 align:middle line:84%
>>HOFFMAN: But
for the most part,

00:29:13.225 --> 00:29:16.210 align:middle line:84%
it's an index that measures
global tanking activity--

00:29:16.210 --> 00:29:16.900 align:middle line:90%
tanker activity.

00:29:16.900 --> 00:29:18.733 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Moving products
around the planet.

00:29:18.733 --> 00:29:19.790 align:middle line:90%
>>HOFFMAN: Yes.

00:29:19.790 --> 00:29:21.650 align:middle line:84%
It puts together a
bunch of variables,

00:29:21.650 --> 00:29:25.370 align:middle line:84%
including prices on
tankers, as they called it

00:29:25.370 --> 00:29:30.100 align:middle line:84%
the day rate, and also
the amount of movement.

00:29:30.100 --> 00:29:31.980 align:middle line:84%
But there are some
things that can affect it

00:29:31.980 --> 00:29:33.690 align:middle line:84%
that are not necessarily
demand driven.

00:29:33.690 --> 00:29:37.130 align:middle line:84%
For instance, there
was a big building boom

00:29:37.130 --> 00:29:40.470 align:middle line:84%
maybe 10 or 15 years ago,
which temporarily caused supply

00:29:40.470 --> 00:29:41.380 align:middle line:90%
to jump up.

00:29:41.380 --> 00:29:44.217 align:middle line:84%
So prices could-- the Baltic
Index could go down a bit,

00:29:44.217 --> 00:29:46.300 align:middle line:84%
but not necessarily because
the economy's falling.

00:29:46.300 --> 00:29:46.755 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:29:46.755 --> 00:29:47.254 align:middle line:90%
Right.

00:29:47.254 --> 00:29:49.270 align:middle line:84%
>>HOFFMAN: I believe
we're past that right now.

00:29:49.270 --> 00:29:50.330 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So all
things being equal,

00:29:50.330 --> 00:29:51.890 align:middle line:84%
it's moving stuff
around the planet.

00:29:51.890 --> 00:29:53.306 align:middle line:84%
>>HOFFMAN: All
things being equal.

00:29:53.306 --> 00:29:55.290 align:middle line:84%
And I don't think
that that big building

00:29:55.290 --> 00:29:58.240 align:middle line:90%
boom is a factor at this moment.

00:29:58.240 --> 00:30:01.780 align:middle line:84%
But right now, I see that it's
had it's-- it's very seasonal.

00:30:01.780 --> 00:30:05.410 align:middle line:84%
If you look at it, it
looks like this every year.

00:30:05.410 --> 00:30:07.080 align:middle line:84%
Kind of like, let's
say, gold demand,

00:30:07.080 --> 00:30:10.550 align:middle line:84%
because you have the Chinese
New Year and the Indian

00:30:10.550 --> 00:30:12.430 align:middle line:90%
the Indian wedding season.

00:30:12.430 --> 00:30:14.874 align:middle line:84%
So you do have some--
or the weather here--

00:30:14.874 --> 00:30:15.540 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:30:15.540 --> 00:30:16.831 align:middle line:90%
>>HOFFMAN: --with retail sales.

00:30:16.831 --> 00:30:18.380 align:middle line:90%
So there are some changes.

00:30:18.380 --> 00:30:21.880 align:middle line:84%
But we're seeing now that
the beginning of this year,

00:30:21.880 --> 00:30:24.650 align:middle line:84%
we're four month into the year,
is the biggest drop it's ever

00:30:24.650 --> 00:30:27.571 align:middle line:84%
had ever in the
beginning of a year.

00:30:27.571 --> 00:30:29.820 align:middle line:84%
And the second biggest drop
in the beginning of a year

00:30:29.820 --> 00:30:30.904 align:middle line:90%
was 2012.

00:30:30.904 --> 00:30:33.070 align:middle line:84%
So we're talking about when
you look back in history

00:30:33.070 --> 00:30:35.153 align:middle line:84%
and some of the worst
declines in history are now.

00:30:35.153 --> 00:30:37.280 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: You're talking,
I think you said earlier,

00:30:37.280 --> 00:30:39.895 align:middle line:84%
25% drop for the first
quarter of this year?

00:30:39.895 --> 00:30:41.770 align:middle line:84%
>>HOFFMAN: I was just
reading about it today.

00:30:41.770 --> 00:30:43.054 align:middle line:90%
I think that's about right.

00:30:43.054 --> 00:30:43.970 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: That's huge.

00:30:43.970 --> 00:30:45.678 align:middle line:84%
>>HOFFMAN: We're not
at the all-time low,

00:30:45.678 --> 00:30:47.870 align:middle line:90%
which was about the 2009, 2010.

00:30:47.870 --> 00:30:49.850 align:middle line:84%
But I firmly believe
we'll get there.

00:30:49.850 --> 00:30:52.000 align:middle line:84%
But the fact is the
seasonal trends--

00:30:52.000 --> 00:30:55.070 align:middle line:84%
just like the fact is we're not
at an all-time high at gasoline

00:30:55.070 --> 00:30:56.920 align:middle line:90%
prices here in the US.

00:30:56.920 --> 00:31:00.941 align:middle line:84%
But we are at an all-time
high for this time of year.

00:31:00.941 --> 00:31:02.440 align:middle line:84%
Because it's not
the driving season.

00:31:02.440 --> 00:31:02.530 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:31:02.530 --> 00:31:02.910 align:middle line:90%
Exactly.

00:31:02.910 --> 00:31:04.030 align:middle line:84%
>>HOFFMAN: I mean, it's
pretty darn high right now.

00:31:04.030 --> 00:31:04.350 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah, it is.

00:31:04.350 --> 00:31:06.620 align:middle line:84%
>>HOFFMAN: But think of
what it could look like.

00:31:06.620 --> 00:31:10.560 align:middle line:84%
Oil's up $5 a barrel
the last two days.

00:31:10.560 --> 00:31:13.570 align:middle line:84%
So I mean, we could be looking
at all-time high gasoline

00:31:13.570 --> 00:31:15.920 align:middle line:90%
prices this summer.

00:31:15.920 --> 00:31:19.979 align:middle line:84%
And it's during, basically,
a horrific recession,

00:31:19.979 --> 00:31:22.020 align:middle line:84%
which is another thing
we're going to talk about.

00:31:22.020 --> 00:31:22.220 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:31:22.220 --> 00:31:22.720 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:31:22.720 --> 00:31:25.600 align:middle line:84%
Let's go to Europe, GDP,
unemployment numbers

00:31:25.600 --> 00:31:27.660 align:middle line:90%
in Europe, young people.

00:31:27.660 --> 00:31:29.420 align:middle line:84%
Not a lot of work
for young people.

00:31:29.420 --> 00:31:33.180 align:middle line:84%
>>HOFFMAN: Europe is the
craziest-- the whole Euroland--

00:31:33.180 --> 00:31:35.190 align:middle line:84%
Eurozone experiment,
the euro currency,

00:31:35.190 --> 00:31:38.790 align:middle line:84%
is the craziest mad experiment
I've ever seen in history.

00:31:38.790 --> 00:31:43.140 align:middle line:84%
It's a prototypical example
of doing stupid things

00:31:43.140 --> 00:31:43.810 align:middle line:90%
at the peak.

00:31:43.810 --> 00:31:47.630 align:middle line:84%
Like, we talked
about the Chinese

00:31:47.630 --> 00:31:51.210 align:middle line:84%
starting this epic
construction boom

00:31:51.210 --> 00:31:54.235 align:middle line:84%
just because the banks
propped the stock market up

00:31:54.235 --> 00:31:56.830 align:middle line:84%
for a couple years to
ridiculously unsustainable

00:31:56.830 --> 00:31:57.590 align:middle line:90%
levels.

00:31:57.590 --> 00:32:03.010 align:middle line:84%
Well, if we talk
about that, we have

00:32:03.010 --> 00:32:05.650 align:middle line:84%
to go to the
creation of the euro.

00:32:05.650 --> 00:32:06.380 align:middle line:90%
OK?

00:32:06.380 --> 00:32:10.170 align:middle line:84%
1999 was the
creation of the euro.

00:32:10.170 --> 00:32:15.149 align:middle line:84%
It was at the quote, "height
of the global economy."

00:32:15.149 --> 00:32:16.940 align:middle line:84%
Where, even though it
was a ridiculous idea

00:32:16.940 --> 00:32:21.380 align:middle line:84%
to start with to put together
22 countries with histories

00:32:21.380 --> 00:32:24.570 align:middle line:84%
of hating each other,
speaking different languages,

00:32:24.570 --> 00:32:28.790 align:middle line:84%
having completely different
economic variables affecting

00:32:28.790 --> 00:32:32.840 align:middle line:84%
them, and different mindsets,
but because, for a brief moment

00:32:32.840 --> 00:32:37.102 align:middle line:84%
in history, just like the
US reported a brief surplus,

00:32:37.102 --> 00:32:38.560 align:middle line:84%
for a brief moment,
the politicians

00:32:38.560 --> 00:32:41.770 align:middle line:84%
thought we can look like
brilliant politicians

00:32:41.770 --> 00:32:43.920 align:middle line:84%
and be feted around
the world for doing

00:32:43.920 --> 00:32:46.170 align:middle line:84%
this great thing of putting
all the European countries

00:32:46.170 --> 00:32:47.020 align:middle line:90%
together.

00:32:47.020 --> 00:32:51.860 align:middle line:84%
And they created these-- what
do you call them-- criteria

00:32:51.860 --> 00:32:54.235 align:middle line:84%
for what the countries would
all have to do economically.

00:32:54.235 --> 00:32:54.901 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:32:54.901 --> 00:32:58.400 align:middle line:84%
>>HOFFMAN: You have to have
a GDP, a debt of x% of GDP,

00:32:58.400 --> 00:32:59.710 align:middle line:90%
and all these things.

00:32:59.710 --> 00:33:03.180 align:middle line:84%
And for the first few
years-- actually, they never

00:33:03.180 --> 00:33:06.050 align:middle line:84%
had them all meeting
those criteria.

00:33:06.050 --> 00:33:07.290 align:middle line:90%
But a few of them did.

00:33:07.290 --> 00:33:10.385 align:middle line:84%
And the rest were reasonably
close in the beginning.

00:33:10.385 --> 00:33:12.260 align:middle line:84%
So they said, see it's
all going to work out.

00:33:12.260 --> 00:33:14.300 align:middle line:84%
And of course, that was
the peak right there.

00:33:14.300 --> 00:33:16.840 align:middle line:84%
And since 1999 when
the euro started,

00:33:16.840 --> 00:33:18.360 align:middle line:90%
it's been all downhill.

00:33:18.360 --> 00:33:21.650 align:middle line:84%
And of course since 2008,
it's really been downhill.

00:33:21.650 --> 00:33:24.440 align:middle line:84%
And as we speak here,
European unemployment

00:33:24.440 --> 00:33:26.030 align:middle line:90%
is at an all-time high.

00:33:26.030 --> 00:33:28.790 align:middle line:84%
European, as you say,
youth unemployment,

00:33:28.790 --> 00:33:32.020 align:middle line:84%
which is under 25--
it's people under 25,

00:33:32.020 --> 00:33:35.570 align:middle line:84%
is an astonishing
24%, which is probably

00:33:35.570 --> 00:33:38.560 align:middle line:84%
what our real unemployment
rate is in this country.

00:33:38.560 --> 00:33:42.294 align:middle line:84%
But in some countries, these
pigs, as they call them--

00:33:42.294 --> 00:33:42.960 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:33:42.960 --> 00:33:45.150 align:middle line:10%
>>HOFFMAN: Again, first
world countries-- Spain,

00:33:45.150 --> 00:33:47.247 align:middle line:10%
Italy we're talking
about-- 50%, 60%--

00:33:47.247 --> 00:33:47.830 align:middle line:10%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:33:47.830 --> 00:33:50.310 align:middle line:10%
>>HOFFMAN: --of the people
under 25 don't have jobs.

00:33:50.310 --> 00:33:52.440 align:middle line:10%
That's why people
don't buy cars anymore.

00:33:52.440 --> 00:33:54.180 align:middle line:10%
That's why everyone
lives at home.

00:33:54.180 --> 00:33:55.580 align:middle line:10%
I mean, we are regressing.

00:33:55.580 --> 00:33:58.324 align:middle line:84%
Talk about society
is regressing.

00:33:58.324 --> 00:34:00.490 align:middle line:84%
And of course, while all
the while this is going on,

00:34:00.490 --> 00:34:03.520 align:middle line:84%
GDP has flattened
out to nothing.

00:34:03.520 --> 00:34:05.290 align:middle line:90%
Debt has exploded.

00:34:05.290 --> 00:34:07.210 align:middle line:90%
Deficits have exploded.

00:34:07.210 --> 00:34:11.280 align:middle line:84%
And the amazing thing
is back in 2012,

00:34:11.280 --> 00:34:15.500 align:middle line:84%
we had a second 2008,
2009 type thing in Europe.

00:34:15.500 --> 00:34:17.690 align:middle line:84%
All the countries are
crashing, the stock markets,

00:34:17.690 --> 00:34:18.750 align:middle line:90%
the bond markets.

00:34:18.750 --> 00:34:22.185 align:middle line:84%
So Mario Draghi, who's
the new head of the ECB,

00:34:22.185 --> 00:34:23.909 align:middle line:90%
he came in around then.

00:34:23.909 --> 00:34:25.960 align:middle line:90%
Former Goldman Sachs, of course.

00:34:25.960 --> 00:34:29.820 align:middle line:84%
He said in July, 2012,
I will do whatever

00:34:29.820 --> 00:34:32.570 align:middle line:90%
it takes to save the euro.

00:34:32.570 --> 00:34:33.739 align:middle line:90%
And then he followed up.

00:34:33.739 --> 00:34:35.969 align:middle line:90%
And believe me, I can do it.

00:34:35.969 --> 00:34:38.000 align:middle line:10%
So immediately
everyone said, they're

00:34:38.000 --> 00:34:41.150 align:middle line:10%
going to do QE at some
point, so don't worry.

00:34:41.150 --> 00:34:43.960 align:middle line:10%
So now, they've created
this ridiculous bubble

00:34:43.960 --> 00:34:45.850 align:middle line:10%
in sovereign European bonds.

00:34:45.850 --> 00:34:48.159 align:middle line:10%
If you could believe--
Greece, Spain we're

00:34:48.159 --> 00:34:49.184 align:middle line:10%
talking about right now.

00:34:49.184 --> 00:34:50.115 align:middle line:84%
Their economies,
remember how bad

00:34:50.115 --> 00:34:52.429 align:middle line:84%
it was three, four years
ago with all the bail outs?

00:34:52.429 --> 00:34:54.177 align:middle line:84%
Their economies
are much worse now.

00:34:54.177 --> 00:34:54.760 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:34:54.760 --> 00:34:56.267 align:middle line:84%
>>HOFFMAN: I mean,
much, much worse.

00:34:56.267 --> 00:34:56.850 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:34:56.850 --> 00:35:00.510 align:middle line:84%
>>HOFFMAN: Their GDP growth
is massively negative.

00:35:00.510 --> 00:35:02.230 align:middle line:84%
Their debt is much
higher, not a hope

00:35:02.230 --> 00:35:04.930 align:middle line:84%
and a prayer of paying back
anything that they owe.

00:35:04.930 --> 00:35:08.230 align:middle line:84%
And yet, their bonded yields
have gone down dramatically,

00:35:08.230 --> 00:35:10.687 align:middle line:84%
clearly because people
are expecting this QE.

00:35:10.687 --> 00:35:11.270 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:35:11.270 --> 00:35:12.090 align:middle line:90%
>>HOFFMAN: QE, yeah.

00:35:12.090 --> 00:35:13.798 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: I think you
also said that they

00:35:13.798 --> 00:35:17.270 align:middle line:84%
are looking toward more
austerity measures.

00:35:17.270 --> 00:35:19.672 align:middle line:90%
How can you be anymore austere?

00:35:19.672 --> 00:35:20.880 align:middle line:90%
>>HOFFMAN: Well, it's a joke.

00:35:20.880 --> 00:35:23.570 align:middle line:84%
Because it's like telling a
child to do something and they

00:35:23.570 --> 00:35:24.120 align:middle line:90%
don't do it.

00:35:24.120 --> 00:35:25.900 align:middle line:84%
And you keep saying, well,
all right, I'll punish you.

00:35:25.900 --> 00:35:27.150 align:middle line:90%
And you don't punish them.

00:35:27.150 --> 00:35:27.490 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:35:27.490 --> 00:35:29.156 align:middle line:84%
>>HOFFMAN: I mean,
at some point, Greece

00:35:29.156 --> 00:35:31.912 align:middle line:84%
and all these countries with the
bail outs know that they're not

00:35:31.912 --> 00:35:32.870 align:middle line:90%
going to be kicked out.

00:35:32.870 --> 00:35:34.780 align:middle line:84%
Because if they ever
kicked Greece out,

00:35:34.780 --> 00:35:38.360 align:middle line:84%
Greece has $500 million
of debt-- billion of debt.

00:35:38.360 --> 00:35:41.230 align:middle line:84%
And on top of that, all the
derivatives that would get

00:35:41.230 --> 00:35:41.810 align:middle line:90%
unleashed.

00:35:41.810 --> 00:35:43.580 align:middle line:90%
So they just say stop doing it.

00:35:43.580 --> 00:35:44.520 align:middle line:90%
Stop, stop.

00:35:44.520 --> 00:35:46.270 align:middle line:84%
But they know they can
never kick them out

00:35:46.270 --> 00:35:48.472 align:middle line:84%
because you know who
owns the Greek debt?

00:35:48.472 --> 00:35:49.930 align:middle line:84%
The French banks,
the German banks.

00:35:49.930 --> 00:35:50.230 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:35:50.230 --> 00:35:51.240 align:middle line:90%
>>HOFFMAN: So they can't do it.

00:35:51.240 --> 00:35:52.698 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: They
can't kick them out.

00:35:52.698 --> 00:35:54.430 align:middle line:84%
>>HOFFMAN: And then
you have the IMF,

00:35:54.430 --> 00:35:58.589 align:middle line:84%
which is kind of a group of
European and American bankers

00:35:58.589 --> 00:36:00.380 align:middle line:84%
that they pretend on
one side of the mouth,

00:36:00.380 --> 00:36:02.894 align:middle line:84%
"Yes, we need more austerity,
so we can get more loans."

00:36:02.894 --> 00:36:04.810 align:middle line:84%
And then the other side
of the mount they say,

00:36:04.810 --> 00:36:07.110 align:middle line:84%
"We need you to print more
money and lower interest rates,

00:36:07.110 --> 00:36:08.540 align:middle line:84%
because everything
is collapsing."

00:36:08.540 --> 00:36:11.820 align:middle line:84%
So it's just become
such a mess over there.

00:36:11.820 --> 00:36:15.020 align:middle line:84%
And finally, they
took interest rates

00:36:15.020 --> 00:36:16.780 align:middle line:90%
slowly but surely down to zero.

00:36:16.780 --> 00:36:17.750 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:36:17.750 --> 00:36:18.840 align:middle line:90%
0.25% or something.

00:36:18.840 --> 00:36:19.821 align:middle line:90%
>>HOFFMAN: Yeah, 0.25%.

00:36:19.821 --> 00:36:21.570 align:middle line:84%
Of course, they're
waiting for the markets

00:36:21.570 --> 00:36:24.932 align:middle line:84%
to have their next fall before
they make the Draconian measure

00:36:24.932 --> 00:36:27.140 align:middle line:84%
of taking that quarter
percent away as if it matters.

00:36:27.140 --> 00:36:27.950 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah, yeah.

00:36:27.950 --> 00:36:29.880 align:middle line:84%
>>HOFFMAN: They finally
said at their meeting

00:36:29.880 --> 00:36:34.330 align:middle line:84%
last week that they are now
modeling a $1.4 trillion

00:36:34.330 --> 00:36:36.324 align:middle line:84%
QE program, which
I knew they would.

00:36:36.324 --> 00:36:36.990 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:36:36.990 --> 00:36:38.573 align:middle line:84%
>>HOFFMAN: And at
some point, probably

00:36:38.573 --> 00:36:43.460 align:middle line:84%
at the same time that Abenomics
is doubled, they will say, yes.

00:36:43.460 --> 00:36:46.550 align:middle line:84%
We're launching-- it's called
the OMT, the Outright Monetary

00:36:46.550 --> 00:36:48.490 align:middle line:90%
Transaction program.

00:36:48.490 --> 00:36:50.327 align:middle line:90%
It's been sitting there waiting.

00:36:50.327 --> 00:36:52.285 align:middle line:84%
Who knows what they're
doing behind the scenes?

00:36:52.285 --> 00:36:54.750 align:middle line:84%
But it's been waiting
in front of the scenes.

00:36:54.750 --> 00:36:55.877 align:middle line:90%
And they will do it.

00:36:55.877 --> 00:36:57.460 align:middle line:10%
And then, of course,
the coup de grace

00:36:57.460 --> 00:37:02.105 align:middle line:10%
will be when Janet Yellen
admits that tapering is a lie--

00:37:02.105 --> 00:37:02.730 align:middle line:10%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:37:02.730 --> 00:37:04.313 align:middle line:10%
>>HOFFMAN: --and
turns it right around

00:37:04.313 --> 00:37:06.394 align:middle line:10%
and starts QEing at
an even greater rate.

00:37:06.394 --> 00:37:07.060 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:37:07.060 --> 00:37:07.580 align:middle line:90%
Right.

00:37:07.580 --> 00:37:08.080 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:37:08.080 --> 00:37:11.134 align:middle line:84%
So now a lot of times
we read about Germany.

00:37:11.134 --> 00:37:13.050 align:middle line:84%
Germany's saying, how
did we get in this mess?

00:37:13.050 --> 00:37:15.980 align:middle line:84%
We're responsible
citizens in this gig here.

00:37:15.980 --> 00:37:18.000 align:middle line:84%
And every now and then
you hear, hey, they'd

00:37:18.000 --> 00:37:19.709 align:middle line:84%
like to release
themselves from the euro.

00:37:19.709 --> 00:37:20.624 align:middle line:90%
>>HOFFMAN: Absolutely.

00:37:20.624 --> 00:37:21.480 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:37:21.480 --> 00:37:23.180 align:middle line:90%
Go back to the Deutsche mark.

00:37:23.180 --> 00:37:24.380 align:middle line:90%
Is this actually happening?

00:37:24.380 --> 00:37:27.160 align:middle line:84%
Do you see a potential where
the euro itself will fail

00:37:27.160 --> 00:37:29.454 align:middle line:84%
and countries will go back
to their initial currencies?

00:37:29.454 --> 00:37:30.370 align:middle line:90%
>>HOFFMAN: Absolutely.

00:37:30.370 --> 00:37:30.970 align:middle line:90%
Absolutely.

00:37:30.970 --> 00:37:32.370 align:middle line:10%
I mean, they're going
to eventually have

00:37:32.370 --> 00:37:34.411 align:middle line:10%
to be gold backed currencies,
because they're all

00:37:34.411 --> 00:37:35.840 align:middle line:10%
fiat currencies.

00:37:35.840 --> 00:37:39.410 align:middle line:10%
But it goes back to
this dirty shirt theory.

00:37:39.410 --> 00:37:40.875 align:middle line:10%
Who has the least dirty shirt?

00:37:40.875 --> 00:37:41.500 align:middle line:10%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:37:41.500 --> 00:37:42.083 align:middle line:10%
>>HOFFMAN: OK?

00:37:42.083 --> 00:37:46.360 align:middle line:10%
Because to say that the
Germans are conservative

00:37:46.360 --> 00:37:49.020 align:middle line:10%
is like saying Republicans
are fiscally conservative.

00:37:49.020 --> 00:37:49.712 align:middle line:10%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:37:49.712 --> 00:37:51.420 align:middle line:84%
>>HOFFMAN: Or that
the Chinese government

00:37:51.420 --> 00:37:54.630 align:middle line:84%
are brilliant
economic tacticians.

00:37:54.630 --> 00:37:55.130 align:middle line:90%
They're not.

00:37:55.130 --> 00:37:57.060 align:middle line:84%
They're just in better
shape than Greece.

00:37:57.060 --> 00:37:58.944 align:middle line:90%
They do have an export industry.

00:37:58.944 --> 00:37:59.610 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:37:59.610 --> 00:38:03.490 align:middle line:84%
>>HOFFMAN: They do have a better
financial condition than Greece

00:38:03.490 --> 00:38:04.900 align:middle line:90%
for whatever that's worth.

00:38:04.900 --> 00:38:08.270 align:middle line:84%
But the fact is it's a fiat
currency if it was left alone.

00:38:08.270 --> 00:38:10.410 align:middle line:84%
And they have a
terrible economy,

00:38:10.410 --> 00:38:11.896 align:middle line:84%
which is also
going nowhere fast.

00:38:11.896 --> 00:38:14.270 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Well, they have
since the absorption of Eastern

00:38:14.270 --> 00:38:15.004 align:middle line:90%
Block--

00:38:15.004 --> 00:38:15.670 align:middle line:90%
>>HOFFMAN: Yeah.

00:38:15.670 --> 00:38:16.600 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: --in East Germany.

00:38:16.600 --> 00:38:18.183 align:middle line:84%
>>HOFFMAN: They are
being pulled down.

00:38:18.183 --> 00:38:21.590 align:middle line:84%
There's no doubt that
these countries, the pigs,

00:38:21.590 --> 00:38:23.630 align:middle line:84%
the southern Europe,
are an anchor which

00:38:23.630 --> 00:38:24.880 align:middle line:90%
they would love to get rid of.

00:38:24.880 --> 00:38:27.500 align:middle line:84%
But again, they've lent so
much money to these countries.

00:38:27.500 --> 00:38:27.750 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:38:27.750 --> 00:38:29.720 align:middle line:84%
>>HOFFMAN: Again, you
can't just get rid of them.

00:38:29.720 --> 00:38:29.990 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: No.

00:38:29.990 --> 00:38:31.823 align:middle line:84%
>>HOFFMAN: Because they
will pull them down.

00:38:31.823 --> 00:38:34.480 align:middle line:84%
It's like the Titanic
split, the bottom came,

00:38:34.480 --> 00:38:38.100 align:middle line:84%
and then it pulled-- there's
no way of avoiding it.

00:38:38.100 --> 00:38:40.180 align:middle line:84%
So people will want
to think, oh yeah,

00:38:40.180 --> 00:38:41.960 align:middle line:90%
the Chinese can just go at it.

00:38:41.960 --> 00:38:44.240 align:middle line:84%
The Germans, all they have
to do is get rid of Greece

00:38:44.240 --> 00:38:45.073 align:middle line:90%
and they'll be fine.

00:38:45.073 --> 00:38:45.900 align:middle line:90%
No.

00:38:45.900 --> 00:38:48.300 align:middle line:84%
Everyone will go through
the painful correction

00:38:48.300 --> 00:38:50.120 align:middle line:90%
no matter how hard they try.

00:38:50.120 --> 00:38:53.260 align:middle line:84%
And some countries may be
better equipped for it.

00:38:53.260 --> 00:38:55.700 align:middle line:84%
But what you see
China-- not China.

00:38:55.700 --> 00:38:57.830 align:middle line:84%
What you see Germany
doing now is they've

00:38:57.830 --> 00:39:01.050 align:middle line:84%
been aligning themselves with
the Chinese and the Russians

00:39:01.050 --> 00:39:03.420 align:middle line:84%
with trade deals
more so than ever.

00:39:03.420 --> 00:39:05.210 align:middle line:90%
And by the way, they need them.

00:39:05.210 --> 00:39:06.960 align:middle line:84%
You see what's going
on in the Ukraine.

00:39:06.960 --> 00:39:09.660 align:middle line:84%
Europe gets a quarter of all
its natural gas from Russia.

00:39:09.660 --> 00:39:09.850 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:39:09.850 --> 00:39:10.870 align:middle line:84%
>>HOFFMAN: A lot of it
goes through the Ukraine.

00:39:10.870 --> 00:39:11.340 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:39:11.340 --> 00:39:12.540 align:middle line:84%
>>HOFFMAN: So there's
politics going on, too.

00:39:12.540 --> 00:39:14.123 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And then
Ukraine, meanwhile,

00:39:14.123 --> 00:39:16.610 align:middle line:84%
is fighting to get into
the European Union.

00:39:16.610 --> 00:39:18.000 align:middle line:90%
>>HOFFMAN: Some of it is.

00:39:18.000 --> 00:39:20.017 align:middle line:84%
Some of it is fighting
to get back into Russia.

00:39:20.017 --> 00:39:23.650 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: The real
Ukrainian population

00:39:23.650 --> 00:39:26.100 align:middle line:84%
before the infiltration by
the Russians into their land.

00:39:26.100 --> 00:39:26.600 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:39:26.600 --> 00:39:28.725 align:middle line:84%
>>HOFFMAN: But the fact is
the Germans are at least

00:39:28.725 --> 00:39:30.570 align:middle line:84%
smart enough to see the
writing on the wall.

00:39:30.570 --> 00:39:34.460 align:middle line:84%
And they have been slowly but
surely aligning themselves

00:39:34.460 --> 00:39:37.270 align:middle line:84%
with the eastern powers that
will eventually be the leaders.

00:39:37.270 --> 00:39:38.520 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Well, smart.

00:39:38.520 --> 00:39:39.700 align:middle line:90%
What about India?

00:39:39.700 --> 00:39:41.350 align:middle line:90%
You say the rupee is crashing.

00:39:41.350 --> 00:39:42.690 align:middle line:90%
And this whole thing about gold.

00:39:42.690 --> 00:39:46.405 align:middle line:84%
I mean, gold is so key in
just the everyday culture.

00:39:46.405 --> 00:39:47.030 align:middle line:90%
>>HOFFMAN: Yes.

00:39:47.030 --> 00:39:50.050 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And so
they're now using--

00:39:50.050 --> 00:39:55.160 align:middle line:84%
they've installed some bans
and tariffs on gold and silver

00:39:55.160 --> 00:39:57.382 align:middle line:90%
transactions in that country.

00:39:57.382 --> 00:39:58.340 align:middle line:90%
What's happening there?

00:39:58.340 --> 00:39:58.965 align:middle line:90%
>>HOFFMAN: Yes.

00:39:58.965 --> 00:40:01.720 align:middle line:84%
India has always been the
largest gold importer,

00:40:01.720 --> 00:40:03.056 align:middle line:90%
gold user, gold everything.

00:40:03.056 --> 00:40:03.680 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:40:03.680 --> 00:40:07.830 align:middle line:84%
>>HOFFMAN: And there's
no-- probably-- aside fro--

00:40:07.830 --> 00:40:13.150 align:middle line:84%
after the Chinese-- or I should
say just ahead of the Chinese,

00:40:13.150 --> 00:40:16.630 align:middle line:84%
the Indians are the culture
that values real money more

00:40:16.630 --> 00:40:19.130 align:middle line:84%
than any, going
back historically.

00:40:19.130 --> 00:40:23.850 align:middle line:84%
If you ask anyone but but the 1%
bankers what their net worth is

00:40:23.850 --> 00:40:26.330 align:middle line:90%
in India, they won't say rupees.

00:40:26.330 --> 00:40:29.440 align:middle line:84%
Instinctively, you
will say dollars.

00:40:29.440 --> 00:40:30.925 align:middle line:90%
I own $1 million of worth.

00:40:30.925 --> 00:40:32.550 align:middle line:84%
I have a half a
million dollars' worth.

00:40:32.550 --> 00:40:34.471 align:middle line:84%
You're even calculating,
oh, I have a house.

00:40:34.471 --> 00:40:34.970 align:middle line:90%
But no, no.

00:40:34.970 --> 00:40:36.317 align:middle line:90%
The house is worth x.

00:40:36.317 --> 00:40:36.900 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:40:36.900 --> 00:40:38.525 align:middle line:84%
>>HOFFMAN: Indians
don't talk that way.

00:40:38.525 --> 00:40:41.014 align:middle line:84%
They think in terms of real
items of value, as I call them.

00:40:41.014 --> 00:40:41.680 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:40:41.680 --> 00:40:44.390 align:middle line:84%
>>HOFFMAN: On a monetary
basis, it's gold.

00:40:44.390 --> 00:40:45.380 align:middle line:90%
Their jewelry is--

00:40:45.380 --> 00:40:47.660 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Jewelry is
in each household.

00:40:47.660 --> 00:40:50.410 align:middle line:84%
>>HOFFMAN: So the way
that I've-- you know,

00:40:50.410 --> 00:40:53.210 align:middle line:84%
what you've seen in the world is
everyone has gone on this fiat

00:40:53.210 --> 00:40:54.170 align:middle line:90%
currency standard.

00:40:54.170 --> 00:40:57.480 align:middle line:10%
They all let Bretton Woods be
broken by the United States

00:40:57.480 --> 00:40:58.690 align:middle line:10%
in 1971.

00:40:58.690 --> 00:41:01.450 align:middle line:10%
They went along with it, because
a bunch of bankers said sure.

00:41:01.450 --> 00:41:04.270 align:middle line:10%
We can get the short term
benefits of all the money

00:41:04.270 --> 00:41:07.140 align:middle line:10%
printing, and that is until
the credit card got charged up,

00:41:07.140 --> 00:41:08.420 align:middle line:10%
which is where we are now.

00:41:08.420 --> 00:41:09.910 align:middle line:10%
But that included the Indians.

00:41:09.910 --> 00:41:12.200 align:middle line:84%
And the way that
I put it-- India,

00:41:12.200 --> 00:41:14.380 align:middle line:84%
the way I describe it
is it's no different

00:41:14.380 --> 00:41:17.860 align:middle line:84%
from a financial perspective
than South Africa

00:41:17.860 --> 00:41:23.170 align:middle line:84%
was under apartheid from
a minority perspective.

00:41:23.170 --> 00:41:27.450 align:middle line:84%
You had a small minority
of white people governing,

00:41:27.450 --> 00:41:30.214 align:middle line:84%
oppressively, a large
majority of non-white people.

00:41:30.214 --> 00:41:30.880 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:41:30.880 --> 00:41:32.330 align:middle line:84%
>>HOFFMAN: And
look what happened.

00:41:32.330 --> 00:41:34.490 align:middle line:90%
And that's why it's ironic.

00:41:34.490 --> 00:41:36.585 align:middle line:84%
Mandela dies and a lot
of people are going,

00:41:36.585 --> 00:41:38.210 align:middle line:84%
well, Mandela really
wasn't a good guy.

00:41:38.210 --> 00:41:40.460 align:middle line:84%
He did a lot of killing
himself and all this.

00:41:40.460 --> 00:41:43.150 align:middle line:84%
And I go, Mandela was
fighting for his rights.

00:41:43.150 --> 00:41:46.310 align:middle line:84%
And whether he was-- whether
there was any killing involved,

00:41:46.310 --> 00:41:47.310 align:middle line:90%
I don't know.

00:41:47.310 --> 00:41:49.020 align:middle line:84%
But the fact is the
white people were

00:41:49.020 --> 00:41:50.340 align:middle line:90%
killing all the black people.

00:41:50.340 --> 00:41:50.530 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Exactly.

00:41:50.530 --> 00:41:52.315 align:middle line:84%
>>HOFFMAN: So they
were killing them back.

00:41:52.315 --> 00:41:54.356 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Well, so how
does this relate to India?

00:41:54.356 --> 00:41:57.290 align:middle line:84%
>>HOFFMAN: And in India you have
a billion and a half people who

00:41:57.290 --> 00:41:58.717 align:middle line:90%
value gold as money--

00:41:58.717 --> 00:41:59.300 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:41:59.300 --> 00:42:02.490 align:middle line:84%
>>HOFFMAN: --ruled by a
handful of Western loving,

00:42:02.490 --> 00:42:06.690 align:middle line:90%
Fed lackeys that print money.

00:42:06.690 --> 00:42:08.790 align:middle line:84%
And they destroy the
national currency.

00:42:08.790 --> 00:42:11.280 align:middle line:84%
And they've created
massive, massive inflation.

00:42:11.280 --> 00:42:13.970 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So how does it help
them to put tariffs on gold

00:42:13.970 --> 00:42:15.030 align:middle line:90%
to the average person?

00:42:15.030 --> 00:42:15.960 align:middle line:90%
>>HOFFMAN: Exactly.

00:42:15.960 --> 00:42:19.220 align:middle line:84%
So not only have they created
massive food inflation-- again,

00:42:19.220 --> 00:42:20.650 align:middle line:90%
we go back to Arab Spring.

00:42:20.650 --> 00:42:23.510 align:middle line:84%
The Indians are among the
highest percentage spenders

00:42:23.510 --> 00:42:24.840 align:middle line:90%
of their income on food.

00:42:24.840 --> 00:42:25.080 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:42:25.080 --> 00:42:27.163 align:middle line:84%
>>HOFFMAN: So they have
had some of the worst food

00:42:27.163 --> 00:42:28.270 align:middle line:90%
inflation in the world.

00:42:28.270 --> 00:42:29.686 align:middle line:84%
And it's one thing
to say you have

00:42:29.686 --> 00:42:32.462 align:middle line:84%
food inflation in
a small country.

00:42:32.462 --> 00:42:34.295 align:middle line:84%
But in a big country
when you have a billion

00:42:34.295 --> 00:42:37.821 align:middle line:84%
and a half people, it's created
some major social problems.

00:42:37.821 --> 00:42:39.570 align:middle line:84%
To the point where the
government has just

00:42:39.570 --> 00:42:43.080 align:middle line:84%
created an open-ended deal
where they're giving out

00:42:43.080 --> 00:42:48.070 align:middle line:84%
almost free rice to like 900
million people, which they

00:42:48.070 --> 00:42:49.440 align:middle line:90%
have to buy on the open market.

00:42:49.440 --> 00:42:51.730 align:middle line:84%
But they're helping to
inflate the cost up.

00:42:51.730 --> 00:42:54.360 align:middle line:84%
So they may not be able
to afford to do this.

00:42:54.360 --> 00:42:55.550 align:middle line:90%
So it's kind of on the edge.

00:42:55.550 --> 00:42:58.840 align:middle line:84%
But anyway, one of
their propaganda schemes

00:42:58.840 --> 00:43:02.782 align:middle line:84%
that they started about--
literally about a year ago--

00:43:02.782 --> 00:43:04.490 align:middle line:84%
actually, two years
ago, if you remember,

00:43:04.490 --> 00:43:06.640 align:middle line:90%
there was a big jewelry strike.

00:43:06.640 --> 00:43:09.280 align:middle line:84%
Because they were
banning the importation

00:43:09.280 --> 00:43:10.740 align:middle line:90%
of gold for jewelry.

00:43:10.740 --> 00:43:13.016 align:middle line:84%
And the jewelers
actually won that battle.

00:43:13.016 --> 00:43:14.390 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: But I
don't understand.

00:43:14.390 --> 00:43:16.106 align:middle line:90%
Why are they doing this?

00:43:16.106 --> 00:43:17.980 align:middle line:84%
>>HOFFMAN: Well, anyway,
a year ago the rupee

00:43:17.980 --> 00:43:19.864 align:middle line:90%
really started crashing hard.

00:43:19.864 --> 00:43:20.530 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:43:20.530 --> 00:43:22.490 align:middle line:84%
>>HOFFMAN: And they
in a propaganda scheme

00:43:22.490 --> 00:43:25.050 align:middle line:84%
said the reason the
rupee is crashing

00:43:25.050 --> 00:43:26.810 align:middle line:84%
is because everyone
is buying gold

00:43:26.810 --> 00:43:31.530 align:middle line:84%
and causing our current account
deficit to balloon, which

00:43:31.530 --> 00:43:34.070 align:middle line:84%
theoretically is why
the currency's falling,

00:43:34.070 --> 00:43:36.290 align:middle line:84%
which is the most ridiculous
thing I've ever heard.

00:43:36.290 --> 00:43:36.530 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Absolutely.

00:43:36.530 --> 00:43:37.488 align:middle line:90%
>>HOFFMAN: I mean, yes.

00:43:37.488 --> 00:43:39.840 align:middle line:84%
It is a fact, current
account deficits

00:43:39.840 --> 00:43:41.820 align:middle line:90%
ballooning is bad for currency.

00:43:41.820 --> 00:43:44.169 align:middle line:84%
But bringing gold
into the country

00:43:44.169 --> 00:43:45.210 align:middle line:90%
is good for the currency.

00:43:45.210 --> 00:43:46.751 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: That's
part of the culture.

00:43:46.751 --> 00:43:48.090 align:middle line:90%
That's intrinsic to the culture.

00:43:48.090 --> 00:43:49.810 align:middle line:84%
>>HOFFMAN: That's
good for a currency

00:43:49.810 --> 00:43:52.580 align:middle line:84%
if you bring in-- that's why the
Chinese government encourages

00:43:52.580 --> 00:43:54.020 align:middle line:90%
its people to buy gold.

00:43:54.020 --> 00:43:55.980 align:middle line:90%
It's good for the currency.

00:43:55.980 --> 00:44:00.550 align:middle line:84%
But anyway, as part of
this ridiculous scheme,

00:44:00.550 --> 00:44:03.730 align:middle line:84%
starting last year they started
to put huge import tariffs

00:44:03.730 --> 00:44:04.522 align:middle line:90%
on gold and silver.

00:44:04.522 --> 00:44:06.646 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: What is a huge
import tariff for example?

00:44:06.646 --> 00:44:07.730 align:middle line:90%
>>HOFFMAN: It was 2%.

00:44:07.730 --> 00:44:09.937 align:middle line:84%
They took it up
to 10% in August.

00:44:09.937 --> 00:44:10.520 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Wow.

00:44:10.520 --> 00:44:12.186 align:middle line:84%
>>HOFFMAN: And on top
of that, they even

00:44:12.186 --> 00:44:16.220 align:middle line:84%
banned, for most of the
banks, the importation of gold

00:44:16.220 --> 00:44:17.971 align:middle line:84%
for the purposes of
selling to the public.

00:44:17.971 --> 00:44:19.595 align:middle line:84%
They actually banned
a lot of the banks

00:44:19.595 --> 00:44:20.880 align:middle line:90%
from selling coins altogether.

00:44:20.880 --> 00:44:21.860 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: I'm
surprised there's not

00:44:21.860 --> 00:44:24.193 align:middle line:84%
rioting in the streets over
that alone no less the food.

00:44:24.193 --> 00:44:27.495 align:middle line:84%
>>HOFFMAN: Well, what it caused
was a massive black market

00:44:27.495 --> 00:44:32.430 align:middle line:84%
to develop to the point where
actual gold sales actually

00:44:32.430 --> 00:44:34.797 align:middle line:84%
increased, because
of that black market.

00:44:34.797 --> 00:44:36.380 align:middle line:84%
And then I was
actually shocked to see

00:44:36.380 --> 00:44:38.610 align:middle line:90%
the final numbers for 2013.

00:44:38.610 --> 00:44:42.110 align:middle line:84%
Even with those import
tariffs, the amount

00:44:42.110 --> 00:44:43.700 align:middle line:84%
of imports of gold
into the country

00:44:43.700 --> 00:44:47.400 align:middle line:84%
was barely lower than the
record levels from '11 and '12.

00:44:47.400 --> 00:44:49.190 align:middle line:84%
And on top of
that, silver-- yes,

00:44:49.190 --> 00:44:51.010 align:middle line:90%
it had a 10% tariff as well.

00:44:51.010 --> 00:44:52.324 align:middle line:90%
But silver is cheaper.

00:44:52.324 --> 00:44:54.740 align:middle line:84%
So there were people who said,
well, I'll just buy silver,

00:44:54.740 --> 00:44:55.760 align:middle line:90%
because it's cheaper.

00:44:55.760 --> 00:45:00.060 align:middle line:84%
Silver imports were 20%
higher than the record year.

00:45:00.060 --> 00:45:04.220 align:middle line:84%
And now on top of that, they
had elections in December.

00:45:04.220 --> 00:45:07.050 align:middle line:84%
And the ruling party, which
is called the Congress

00:45:07.050 --> 00:45:11.020 align:middle line:84%
Party, ironically, was
voted out everywhere.

00:45:11.020 --> 00:45:14.130 align:middle line:84%
So now you have the national
Prime Minister election

00:45:14.130 --> 00:45:15.649 align:middle line:90%
coming up next month.

00:45:15.649 --> 00:45:17.440 align:middle line:84%
And everyone knows that
this Congress party

00:45:17.440 --> 00:45:20.830 align:middle line:84%
is going to get their butt
kicked by what's called the BJP

00:45:20.830 --> 00:45:23.310 align:middle line:84%
Party, who has a leader
who's very pro-gold.

00:45:23.310 --> 00:45:25.460 align:middle line:84%
So all of a sudden
they're now talking about,

00:45:25.460 --> 00:45:28.470 align:middle line:84%
well, I think maybe we'll
get rid of these tariffs

00:45:28.470 --> 00:45:30.850 align:middle line:84%
because we've changed our
mind, when really they

00:45:30.850 --> 00:45:32.830 align:middle line:90%
just want to get votes.

00:45:32.830 --> 00:45:36.680 align:middle line:84%
But either way, my guess is
black market or not, they're

00:45:36.680 --> 00:45:38.830 align:middle line:84%
going to get rid of all
those tariffs at some point

00:45:38.830 --> 00:45:39.870 align:middle line:90%
in the next year or two.

00:45:39.870 --> 00:45:40.230 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Well, yeah.

00:45:40.230 --> 00:45:41.150 align:middle line:90%
It makes sense.

00:45:41.150 --> 00:45:43.880 align:middle line:84%
>>HOFFMAN: And, of course, that
means even more buying of gold.

00:45:43.880 --> 00:45:44.651 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:45:44.651 --> 00:45:45.150 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:45:45.150 --> 00:45:46.902 align:middle line:90%
On to the fragile five.

00:45:46.902 --> 00:45:47.610 align:middle line:90%
>>HOFFMAN: Right.

00:45:47.610 --> 00:45:49.680 align:middle line:84%
Well, the fragile five,
India would be one of them.

00:45:49.680 --> 00:45:50.263 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:45:50.263 --> 00:45:52.090 align:middle line:84%
>>HOFFMAN: It's a
term that came up--

00:45:52.090 --> 00:45:54.210 align:middle line:84%
came around probably
about a year ago

00:45:54.210 --> 00:45:59.040 align:middle line:84%
last summer, because another
propaganda misnomer is

00:45:59.040 --> 00:46:01.230 align:middle line:84%
this every time
currency's fall, they

00:46:01.230 --> 00:46:03.760 align:middle line:84%
say it's an emerging
markets crisis.

00:46:03.760 --> 00:46:06.670 align:middle line:84%
It's just one of their catch-all
terms that kind of tries

00:46:06.670 --> 00:46:09.010 align:middle line:84%
to downplay it and
say, well, it's

00:46:09.010 --> 00:46:11.920 align:middle line:84%
really only these bad countries,
these horribly managed

00:46:11.920 --> 00:46:12.420 align:middle line:90%
countries.

00:46:12.420 --> 00:46:15.150 align:middle line:84%
It couldn't possibly happen
in the United States.

00:46:15.150 --> 00:46:17.190 align:middle line:84%
But the fact is
what we're seeing

00:46:17.190 --> 00:46:20.854 align:middle line:84%
is all currencies have been
falling against the dollar.

00:46:20.854 --> 00:46:23.270 align:middle line:84%
And the dollar's been falling
against real items of value,

00:46:23.270 --> 00:46:26.240 align:middle line:84%
which is why we're having
huge price inflation in food

00:46:26.240 --> 00:46:27.780 align:middle line:90%
and energy and all these things.

00:46:27.780 --> 00:46:31.340 align:middle line:84%
But basically, if you look
at when this all started,

00:46:31.340 --> 00:46:34.970 align:middle line:84%
2008 is when the big, as I say,
money printing orgy started.

00:46:34.970 --> 00:46:37.340 align:middle line:84%
That was the "save
the world" thing.

00:46:37.340 --> 00:46:40.450 align:middle line:84%
And for a couple a
years it seemed to work.

00:46:40.450 --> 00:46:42.410 align:middle line:84%
Because the stock
markets recovered.

00:46:42.410 --> 00:46:44.770 align:middle line:90%
And confidence recovered a bit.

00:46:44.770 --> 00:46:47.380 align:middle line:84%
And some people might have
even spent some money.

00:46:47.380 --> 00:46:47.880 align:middle line:90%
Right?

00:46:47.880 --> 00:46:50.370 align:middle line:84%
I remember when George Bush
was sending checks out saying,

00:46:50.370 --> 00:46:52.290 align:middle line:84%
go and spend it
and be patriotic.

00:46:52.290 --> 00:46:53.030 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:46:53.030 --> 00:46:54.660 align:middle line:84%
>>HOFFMAN: So for
a couple years,

00:46:54.660 --> 00:46:56.150 align:middle line:84%
it was kind of
everyone was saying,

00:46:56.150 --> 00:46:58.100 align:middle line:90%
well, I guess maybe it worked.

00:46:58.100 --> 00:46:58.780 align:middle line:90%
Right?

00:46:58.780 --> 00:47:02.380 align:middle line:84%
But then by 2011 or so,
the world was realizing it

00:47:02.380 --> 00:47:05.340 align:middle line:84%
wasn't working,m and the Arab
Spring had already been caused.

00:47:05.340 --> 00:47:07.110 align:middle line:84%
Because, again, all
that money printing

00:47:07.110 --> 00:47:09.840 align:middle line:84%
went right to the countries
that spend food the most.

00:47:09.840 --> 00:47:12.030 align:middle line:84%
And then, of course,
as I said in 2011,

00:47:12.030 --> 00:47:13.620 align:middle line:90%
Europe started to fall apart.

00:47:13.620 --> 00:47:15.530 align:middle line:84%
Heck, we had our
S & P downgraded

00:47:15.530 --> 00:47:16.650 align:middle line:90%
in the United States.

00:47:16.650 --> 00:47:18.840 align:middle line:84%
And there was a real
crisis going on.

00:47:18.840 --> 00:47:20.670 align:middle line:84%
So that-- I think
it was at that point

00:47:20.670 --> 00:47:23.290 align:middle line:84%
where the central banks of
the world realized, holy cow.

00:47:23.290 --> 00:47:25.790 align:middle line:84%
All that stuff from '08, all
that money printing didn't work

00:47:25.790 --> 00:47:26.620 align:middle line:90%
at all.

00:47:26.620 --> 00:47:29.220 align:middle line:84%
Our only hope right now
in this Ponzi scheme,

00:47:29.220 --> 00:47:32.240 align:middle line:84%
which has to get bigger,
is to double up, triple up,

00:47:32.240 --> 00:47:36.060 align:middle line:84%
quadruple up, and just
manipulate the markets even

00:47:36.060 --> 00:47:37.752 align:middle line:84%
more, and put out
more propaganda.

00:47:37.752 --> 00:47:38.960 align:middle line:90%
And that's what they've done.

00:47:38.960 --> 00:47:40.830 align:middle line:90%
That's when QE was birthed.

00:47:40.830 --> 00:47:42.860 align:middle line:84%
Well, first it was--
in this country

00:47:42.860 --> 00:47:47.104 align:middle line:84%
it was Operation Twist, which
was really a back door QE.

00:47:47.104 --> 00:47:48.770 align:middle line:84%
And then, of course,
at the end of 2012,

00:47:48.770 --> 00:47:52.200 align:middle line:84%
they initiated QE
three and four.

00:47:52.200 --> 00:47:55.200 align:middle line:84%
Abenomics, they started
talking about in 2012

00:47:55.200 --> 00:47:57.240 align:middle line:90%
and initiated right afterward.

00:47:57.240 --> 00:48:00.080 align:middle line:84%
And in Europe, they did
something called the LTRO, Long

00:48:00.080 --> 00:48:03.660 align:middle line:84%
Term Refinancing Operation,
which really meant

00:48:03.660 --> 00:48:05.420 align:middle line:84%
printing money and
giving it to the banks.

00:48:05.420 --> 00:48:08.590 align:middle line:84%
So then you really saw the
money printing go crazy.

00:48:08.590 --> 00:48:11.170 align:middle line:84%
That's when you've seen the
spike in the money supply.

00:48:11.170 --> 00:48:14.510 align:middle line:84%
And as a result, major
exportation inflation

00:48:14.510 --> 00:48:16.000 align:middle line:90%
around the world.

00:48:16.000 --> 00:48:21.680 align:middle line:84%
So not just the Arab Spring, but
it's starting to go everywhere.

00:48:21.680 --> 00:48:23.060 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: It is
a global economy.

00:48:23.060 --> 00:48:23.430 align:middle line:90%
>>HOFFMAN: Yes.

00:48:23.430 --> 00:48:25.790 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: You know, people
can argue against globalism.

00:48:25.790 --> 00:48:26.670 align:middle line:90%
But it is.

00:48:26.670 --> 00:48:29.740 align:middle line:84%
>>HOFFMAN: So the
average currency

00:48:29.740 --> 00:48:33.690 align:middle line:84%
has fallen by 30% against the
dollar in the past three years.

00:48:33.690 --> 00:48:36.320 align:middle line:84%
Pretty much when, as I said,
Operation Twist and all the QEs

00:48:36.320 --> 00:48:37.700 align:middle line:90%
started.

00:48:37.700 --> 00:48:39.964 align:middle line:84%
The dollar-- again, we
have major inflation here.

00:48:39.964 --> 00:48:40.630 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:48:40.630 --> 00:48:42.665 align:middle line:84%
>>HOFFMAN: But those
countries have it

00:48:42.665 --> 00:48:45.400 align:middle line:84%
when they're importing as
well as within the country.

00:48:45.400 --> 00:48:48.090 align:middle line:84%
So they're having major
social unrest, major problems.

00:48:48.090 --> 00:48:50.294 align:middle line:10%
I mean, Venezuela is a
great example the way

00:48:50.294 --> 00:48:51.710 align:middle line:10%
they are hyperinflating
right now.

00:48:51.710 --> 00:48:53.270 align:middle line:10%
But you're seeing
it in Thailand.

00:48:53.270 --> 00:48:55.930 align:middle line:10%
Ukraine was another country
where you've seen that happen.

00:48:55.930 --> 00:49:01.770 align:middle line:10%
Kazakhstan, Turkey, Brazil,
Argentina, you name it.

00:49:01.770 --> 00:49:04.400 align:middle line:84%
It's spreading, all this
exportation of inflation.

00:49:04.400 --> 00:49:06.310 align:middle line:90%
India perfect example.

00:49:06.310 --> 00:49:08.590 align:middle line:84%
The fragile five
referred to five

00:49:08.590 --> 00:49:10.860 align:middle line:84%
of the larger of
these currencies which

00:49:10.860 --> 00:49:12.087 align:middle line:90%
were falling like this.

00:49:12.087 --> 00:49:12.670 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:49:12.670 --> 00:49:15.480 align:middle line:84%
>>HOFFMAN: Because again,
these five countries,

00:49:15.480 --> 00:49:19.910 align:middle line:84%
India, Indonesia, Brazil,
South Africa, and Turkey,

00:49:19.910 --> 00:49:22.350 align:middle line:84%
is where 24% of the
world's population lives.

00:49:22.350 --> 00:49:26.750 align:middle line:84%
So we're talking about out
of control food inflation

00:49:26.750 --> 00:49:28.300 align:middle line:84%
for a quarter of
the world's people.

00:49:28.300 --> 00:49:28.960 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:49:28.960 --> 00:49:31.560 align:middle line:84%
>>HOFFMAN: And again,
they stabilized them

00:49:31.560 --> 00:49:34.900 align:middle line:84%
with a lot of currency
intervention back last summer.

00:49:34.900 --> 00:49:36.270 align:middle line:90%
I mean, overt, it was out there.

00:49:36.270 --> 00:49:38.010 align:middle line:90%
It says Brazil intervening.

00:49:38.010 --> 00:49:39.407 align:middle line:90%
And it stabilized.

00:49:39.407 --> 00:49:41.156 align:middle line:84%
And sure enough, we've
now had another one

00:49:41.156 --> 00:49:43.790 align:middle line:84%
in the last month or two
where those currencies started

00:49:43.790 --> 00:49:46.120 align:middle line:90%
plunging again.

00:49:46.120 --> 00:49:48.130 align:middle line:90%
Brazil was another one.

00:49:48.130 --> 00:49:52.300 align:middle line:84%
Argentina, Indonesia,
you've seen it again.

00:49:52.300 --> 00:49:55.280 align:middle line:84%
And so here we are with
this more intervention.

00:49:55.280 --> 00:49:57.020 align:middle line:84%
And at the same time
this is happening,

00:49:57.020 --> 00:49:59.730 align:middle line:84%
you now have Japan
accelerating Abenomics

00:49:59.730 --> 00:50:00.890 align:middle line:90%
depressing their currency.

00:50:00.890 --> 00:50:04.200 align:middle line:84%
A major, major announcement
was a couple weeks ago

00:50:04.200 --> 00:50:05.990 align:middle line:84%
when China announced
that they are

00:50:05.990 --> 00:50:07.290 align:middle line:90%
widening the band on the yuan.

00:50:07.290 --> 00:50:08.630 align:middle line:84%
So they could devalue
their currency.

00:50:08.630 --> 00:50:09.588 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Oh, goodness.

00:50:09.588 --> 00:50:10.150 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:50:10.150 --> 00:50:12.740 align:middle line:84%
>>HOFFMAN: Now, we have here the
euro bank talking about a 1.4--

00:50:12.740 --> 00:50:13.410 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:50:13.410 --> 00:50:16.390 align:middle line:84%
>>HOFFMAN: So the point is
it's only going to get worse.

00:50:16.390 --> 00:50:17.070 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: We're going
to talk about the US

00:50:17.070 --> 00:50:18.130 align:middle line:90%
before we wrap it up.

00:50:18.130 --> 00:50:21.530 align:middle line:84%
Is there any place on the
planet that's actually doing OK?

00:50:21.530 --> 00:50:24.810 align:middle line:84%
I mean, is Bhutan, or
is anyone doing OK?

00:50:24.810 --> 00:50:26.490 align:middle line:84%
>>HOFFMAN: Well,
it's all relative.

00:50:26.490 --> 00:50:27.257 align:middle line:90%
I mean--

00:50:27.257 --> 00:50:29.090 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: I guess if
you're still close to--

00:50:29.090 --> 00:50:29.900 align:middle line:84%
>>HOFFMAN: I can't
speak for Bhutan.

00:50:29.900 --> 00:50:32.110 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: If you're still
an agrarian culture,

00:50:32.110 --> 00:50:35.160 align:middle line:84%
and have a fairly closed loop,
and maybe live in a village

00:50:35.160 --> 00:50:36.910 align:middle line:84%
on a hilltop that can
provide for itself--

00:50:36.910 --> 00:50:38.118 align:middle line:90%
>>HOFFMAN: I would say, yeah.

00:50:38.118 --> 00:50:41.270 align:middle line:84%
I would say probably
some of the OPEC nations

00:50:41.270 --> 00:50:42.830 align:middle line:90%
by virtue of high oil prices.

00:50:42.830 --> 00:50:43.260 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Well, that's true.

00:50:43.260 --> 00:50:43.970 align:middle line:84%
>>HOFFMAN: But they're
not all doing well.

00:50:43.970 --> 00:50:45.840 align:middle line:84%
Because they have
been mismanaged.

00:50:45.840 --> 00:50:48.070 align:middle line:84%
And they all concentrated
the wealth at the top.

00:50:48.070 --> 00:50:50.990 align:middle line:84%
And then there are ones like
Venezuela, OPEC nation, fourth

00:50:50.990 --> 00:50:52.410 align:middle line:90%
or fifth largest producer.

00:50:52.410 --> 00:50:55.910 align:middle line:84%
It's in hyperinflation,
because again fiat currencies

00:50:55.910 --> 00:50:58.319 align:middle line:90%
are mismanaged by everyone.

00:50:58.319 --> 00:50:59.860 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So let's
talk about the US,

00:50:59.860 --> 00:51:01.604 align:middle line:84%
speaking of mismanaged
fiat currencies.

00:51:01.604 --> 00:51:02.270 align:middle line:90%
>>HOFFMAN: Yeah.

00:51:02.270 --> 00:51:04.630 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Let's talk
about our real numbers,

00:51:04.630 --> 00:51:07.250 align:middle line:84%
our employment
numbers and so forth.

00:51:07.250 --> 00:51:09.942 align:middle line:84%
>>HOFFMAN: Remember, we have the
reserve currency of the world,

00:51:09.942 --> 00:51:10.650 align:middle line:90%
at least for now.

00:51:10.650 --> 00:51:12.483 align:middle line:84%
I mean, you see the
announcements out there.

00:51:12.483 --> 00:51:15.740 align:middle line:84%
It's gonna be gone soon,
just like every reserve

00:51:15.740 --> 00:51:16.980 align:middle line:90%
currency before it.

00:51:16.980 --> 00:51:18.850 align:middle line:84%
But because we've
had it, it's allowed

00:51:18.850 --> 00:51:20.770 align:middle line:84%
us to do some of
these horrible things

00:51:20.770 --> 00:51:24.490 align:middle line:84%
that everyone else is doing and
not have as Draconian effect.

00:51:24.490 --> 00:51:26.530 align:middle line:90%
We have record high food stamps.

00:51:26.530 --> 00:51:29.010 align:middle line:84%
We have record low labor
participation rate.

00:51:29.010 --> 00:51:31.480 align:middle line:84%
We have record low real
wages, all these things.

00:51:31.480 --> 00:51:35.030 align:middle line:84%
But we don't have all out
social unrest like in Venezuela

00:51:35.030 --> 00:51:35.594 align:middle line:90%
just yet.

00:51:35.594 --> 00:51:36.260 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:51:36.260 --> 00:51:38.690 align:middle line:90%
And I have here the numbers.

00:51:38.690 --> 00:51:42.715 align:middle line:84%
You say labor participation
is at a 35 year low.

00:51:42.715 --> 00:51:43.340 align:middle line:90%
>>HOFFMAN: Yes.

00:51:43.340 --> 00:51:45.798 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: I mean, adjusted to
population growth relatively.

00:51:45.798 --> 00:51:47.937 align:middle line:90%


00:51:47.937 --> 00:51:48.520 align:middle line:90%
>>HOFFMAN: No.

00:51:48.520 --> 00:51:50.020 align:middle line:84%
I mean the actual
percentage of people--

00:51:50.020 --> 00:51:50.200 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Really?

00:51:50.200 --> 00:51:51.533 align:middle line:90%
>>HOFFMAN: --yeah-- is that low.

00:51:51.533 --> 00:51:54.970 align:middle line:84%
It's down to where it was
in the late '70s, which

00:51:54.970 --> 00:51:57.640 align:middle line:84%
is when women started
entering the workforce.

00:51:57.640 --> 00:52:01.176 align:middle line:84%
So you think about on apples
to apples, it's even worse.

00:52:01.176 --> 00:52:02.550 align:middle line:84%
Because that's a
time when people

00:52:02.550 --> 00:52:04.400 align:middle line:84%
were surging into
the labor force.

00:52:04.400 --> 00:52:06.580 align:middle line:84%
And by the way, the
women-- again, you

00:52:06.580 --> 00:52:09.360 align:middle line:84%
talk about all the
misnomers in history.

00:52:09.360 --> 00:52:13.190 align:middle line:84%
Women didn't surge into labor
force in the '70s and '80s

00:52:13.190 --> 00:52:16.070 align:middle line:84%
because of women's lib and
they were all dying to work

00:52:16.070 --> 00:52:17.000 align:middle line:90%
and being equal.

00:52:17.000 --> 00:52:20.680 align:middle line:84%
They did it because, in 1971,
we went off the gold standard,

00:52:20.680 --> 00:52:23.860 align:middle line:84%
inflation surged, and
all of a sudden families

00:52:23.860 --> 00:52:25.260 align:middle line:90%
couldn't survive on one income.

00:52:25.260 --> 00:52:25.780 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: That is right.

00:52:25.780 --> 00:52:27.654 align:middle line:84%
>>HOFFMAN: That's what
happened in my family.

00:52:27.654 --> 00:52:30.005 align:middle line:84%
My mother was a-- well, now
you can't say housewife.

00:52:30.005 --> 00:52:31.880 align:middle line:84%
You have to say a
stay-at-home mom

00:52:31.880 --> 00:52:34.934 align:middle line:84%
until she went back to school
and got a real job in 1980.

00:52:34.934 --> 00:52:35.850 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: My mom, too.

00:52:35.850 --> 00:52:36.349 align:middle line:90%
Same thing.

00:52:36.349 --> 00:52:38.940 align:middle line:84%
>>HOFFMAN: Because we
couldn't afford the same life

00:52:38.940 --> 00:52:40.110 align:middle line:90%
with all the inflation.

00:52:40.110 --> 00:52:40.943 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Very true.

00:52:40.943 --> 00:52:43.870 align:middle line:84%
>>HOFFMAN: But the point is
we're back at that level now.

00:52:43.870 --> 00:52:48.490 align:middle line:84%
And the unemployment rate would
be probably four times what

00:52:48.490 --> 00:52:52.320 align:middle line:84%
it is if they didn't publish
it in such a ridiculous lie.

00:52:52.320 --> 00:52:53.090 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:52:53.090 --> 00:52:55.070 align:middle line:84%
Yeah, the way they manipulate
those numbers is criminal.

00:52:55.070 --> 00:52:55.220 align:middle line:90%
>>HOFFMAN: Yeah.

00:52:55.220 --> 00:52:57.490 align:middle line:84%
I mean, the real number is
probably 25 plus percent.

00:52:57.490 --> 00:53:01.980 align:middle line:84%
And right now we have a
record low real wages.

00:53:01.980 --> 00:53:04.040 align:middle line:84%
They keep falling and
falling and falling,

00:53:04.040 --> 00:53:07.040 align:middle line:84%
which means now you need
three people in the household

00:53:07.040 --> 00:53:07.880 align:middle line:90%
to support you.

00:53:07.880 --> 00:53:09.879 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Well, and you're
saying real inflation

00:53:09.879 --> 00:53:12.380 align:middle line:84%
is at about-- running
on average 8% to 9%.

00:53:12.380 --> 00:53:17.160 align:middle line:84%
And we can expect 20%
inflation on food in 2014

00:53:17.160 --> 00:53:19.210 align:middle line:84%
in the US when we just
went through roughly

00:53:19.210 --> 00:53:20.660 align:middle line:90%
that over the last year or two.

00:53:20.660 --> 00:53:22.770 align:middle line:84%
>>HOFFMAN: Well, I
can't say exactly what

00:53:22.770 --> 00:53:24.600 align:middle line:90%
food prices will do in 2014.

00:53:24.600 --> 00:53:29.460 align:middle line:84%
I know that the food indices,
the agricultural price indices,

00:53:29.460 --> 00:53:31.940 align:middle line:84%
are up 20% just in
the last three months.

00:53:31.940 --> 00:53:34.830 align:middle line:84%
And a lot of that already
has gone into the stores.

00:53:34.830 --> 00:53:36.400 align:middle line:90%
And some it will lag.

00:53:36.400 --> 00:53:39.770 align:middle line:84%
But you know, we're at all-time
high beef prices, milk prices,

00:53:39.770 --> 00:53:40.437 align:middle line:90%
chicken prices--

00:53:40.437 --> 00:53:41.561 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: All the proteins.

00:53:41.561 --> 00:53:44.020 align:middle line:84%
>>HOFFMAN: --bacon
prices across the board.

00:53:44.020 --> 00:53:46.020 align:middle line:84%
And of course, now we
have these droughts

00:53:46.020 --> 00:53:47.690 align:middle line:90%
in California and Brazil.

00:53:47.690 --> 00:53:50.110 align:middle line:84%
I mean, in California,
they produce

00:53:50.110 --> 00:53:52.120 align:middle line:84%
I think 2/3-- I
have some charts--

00:53:52.120 --> 00:53:54.070 align:middle line:84%
2/3 of all the produce
in this country.

00:53:54.070 --> 00:53:55.820 align:middle line:84%
And in Brazil, which
is having an equally

00:53:55.820 --> 00:53:57.780 align:middle line:84%
bad historic drought,
I mean, that's

00:53:57.780 --> 00:53:59.500 align:middle line:84%
a half of the world's
sugar and a quarter

00:53:59.500 --> 00:54:01.687 align:middle line:84%
of the soybeans, which
are in everything,

00:54:01.687 --> 00:54:02.770 align:middle line:90%
and a third of the coffee.

00:54:02.770 --> 00:54:04.920 align:middle line:84%
So you have all
these things that

00:54:04.920 --> 00:54:08.880 align:middle line:84%
are kind of coming together
as the world is accelerating

00:54:08.880 --> 00:54:09.800 align:middle line:90%
its money printing.

00:54:09.800 --> 00:54:12.750 align:middle line:84%
And by the way, it's
getting harder and harder

00:54:12.750 --> 00:54:15.165 align:middle line:84%
to grow food, to mine
gold, to produce oil.

00:54:15.165 --> 00:54:16.706 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Well,
let's talk about-- we

00:54:16.706 --> 00:54:17.870 align:middle line:90%
only have a couple minutes left.

00:54:17.870 --> 00:54:19.000 align:middle line:90%
Now, this is a whole thing.

00:54:19.000 --> 00:54:22.420 align:middle line:90%
So you left Wall Street.

00:54:22.420 --> 00:54:24.480 align:middle line:84%
You're into gold,
silver, hard assets.

00:54:24.480 --> 00:54:26.330 align:middle line:84%
I mean, that is
your background now.

00:54:26.330 --> 00:54:28.810 align:middle line:90%
That's what you believe in.

00:54:28.810 --> 00:54:30.850 align:middle line:90%
I agree with you.

00:54:30.850 --> 00:54:34.195 align:middle line:84%
But because of what's
going on in the economy,

00:54:34.195 --> 00:54:36.810 align:middle line:84%
it's becoming very-- and
because of the suppression

00:54:36.810 --> 00:54:39.190 align:middle line:84%
of gold prices, it's
becoming very difficult

00:54:39.190 --> 00:54:42.380 align:middle line:84%
for the mining companies to
stay alive and even continue.

00:54:42.380 --> 00:54:45.590 align:middle line:84%
So what's that mean when
you have these incredibly

00:54:45.590 --> 00:54:48.690 align:middle line:84%
suppressed prices and at
the same time very high

00:54:48.690 --> 00:54:51.655 align:middle line:84%
demand and limited
supplies going on?

00:54:51.655 --> 00:54:53.030 align:middle line:84%
What's going to
come out of that?

00:54:53.030 --> 00:54:54.571 align:middle line:84%
>>HOFFMAN: Well,
the perfect example,

00:54:54.571 --> 00:54:57.157 align:middle line:84%
again-- the reason
I'm so good at what

00:54:57.157 --> 00:54:59.490 align:middle line:84%
I do is because of all the
various backgrounds I've had.

00:54:59.490 --> 00:54:59.940 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:54:59.940 --> 00:55:02.439 align:middle line:84%
>>HOFFMAN: I was an oil analyst
on Wall Street for 10 years.

00:55:02.439 --> 00:55:05.130 align:middle line:84%
Not just a guy doing
bank stocks, I did oil.

00:55:05.130 --> 00:55:06.410 align:middle line:90%
I went on rigs.

00:55:06.410 --> 00:55:10.870 align:middle line:84%
I did all the studies of how
much it costs to produce oil.

00:55:10.870 --> 00:55:14.810 align:middle line:84%
And back then, oil was $20 a
barrel when I left in 2005.

00:55:14.810 --> 00:55:16.430 align:middle line:90%
Maybe it was $25 a barrel.

00:55:16.430 --> 00:55:19.910 align:middle line:84%
All the analysts were predicting
it would go down to $20 and $15

00:55:19.910 --> 00:55:20.760 align:middle line:90%
forever.

00:55:20.760 --> 00:55:23.660 align:middle line:84%
But the fact is the low
hanging fruit, as we call it

00:55:23.660 --> 00:55:27.990 align:middle line:84%
in the extraction
business, is quickly--

00:55:27.990 --> 00:55:29.490 align:middle line:90%
was quickly taken away.

00:55:29.490 --> 00:55:32.170 align:middle line:84%
The Gulf of Mexico, the
shallow stuff, is gone.

00:55:32.170 --> 00:55:33.550 align:middle line:90%
So they went deeper and deeper.

00:55:33.550 --> 00:55:34.616 align:middle line:90%
I was-- I did--

00:55:34.616 --> 00:55:36.240 align:middle line:84%
Deepwater rigs was
a big thing of mine.

00:55:36.240 --> 00:55:39.680 align:middle line:84%
I was on the Deepwater
Horizon, the rig that blew up.

00:55:39.680 --> 00:55:42.010 align:middle line:84%
And the fact is, it
blew up because it

00:55:42.010 --> 00:55:44.090 align:middle line:84%
was trying to do
things, to find oil

00:55:44.090 --> 00:55:46.210 align:middle line:84%
where they could
never find it before.

00:55:46.210 --> 00:55:49.140 align:middle line:84%
And they drilled into a place,
which is very high pressure.

00:55:49.140 --> 00:55:50.300 align:middle line:90%
And they didn't realize it.

00:55:50.300 --> 00:55:53.130 align:middle line:84%
It's so expensive to
drill oil that the Saudis

00:55:53.130 --> 00:55:55.550 align:middle line:90%
need $80 oil right now.

00:55:55.550 --> 00:55:57.390 align:middle line:90%
Saudis used to need $5 oil.

00:55:57.390 --> 00:56:02.600 align:middle line:84%
So the growth curve of
prices has been exponential.

00:56:02.600 --> 00:56:04.870 align:middle line:84%
And that goes for
any new technology

00:56:04.870 --> 00:56:06.670 align:middle line:90%
that people get excited about.

00:56:06.670 --> 00:56:08.790 align:middle line:84%
At one point it
was the tar sands,

00:56:08.790 --> 00:56:10.820 align:middle line:84%
much more expensive
than people thought.

00:56:10.820 --> 00:56:13.060 align:middle line:84%
And now the new
thing is fracking.

00:56:13.060 --> 00:56:14.470 align:middle line:90%
Oh, it's going to save America.

00:56:14.470 --> 00:56:15.100 align:middle line:90%
No, not really.

00:56:15.100 --> 00:56:16.850 align:middle line:84%
If it was really saving
America, and we've

00:56:16.850 --> 00:56:18.670 align:middle line:84%
had a huge increase
in production,

00:56:18.670 --> 00:56:20.890 align:middle line:84%
how come the price of
gasoline is at all-time highs?

00:56:20.890 --> 00:56:23.500 align:middle line:84%
And now they're finding out that
it costs a lot more to frack

00:56:23.500 --> 00:56:24.250 align:middle line:90%
than they thought.

00:56:24.250 --> 00:56:24.370 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah, exacly.

00:56:24.370 --> 00:56:26.390 align:middle line:84%
>>HOFFMAN: It causes more
environmental damage.

00:56:26.390 --> 00:56:28.350 align:middle line:84%
And by the way, it
depletes more quickly

00:56:28.350 --> 00:56:30.370 align:middle line:84%
than they thought, which
means more expensive.

00:56:30.370 --> 00:56:33.970 align:middle line:84%
So the fact is in the
oil business, where

00:56:33.970 --> 00:56:37.381 align:middle line:84%
you have a cartel supporting
prices, this is what happened.

00:56:37.381 --> 00:56:38.880 align:middle line:84%
And now in the gold
business, you've

00:56:38.880 --> 00:56:42.080 align:middle line:84%
had the cartel dramatically
attacking prices

00:56:42.080 --> 00:56:44.780 align:middle line:84%
for 15 years to the
point where, I mean,

00:56:44.780 --> 00:56:46.850 align:middle line:84%
all you have to do is
look at the numbers.

00:56:46.850 --> 00:56:50.670 align:middle line:84%
I mean, the mining industry
lost, I think, $40 billion

00:56:50.670 --> 00:56:51.790 align:middle line:90%
last year.

00:56:51.790 --> 00:56:55.230 align:middle line:84%
And this is a group with a
market cap of $3 billion.

00:56:55.230 --> 00:56:58.500 align:middle line:84%
They wrote off a quarter to
a third of all their assets.

00:56:58.500 --> 00:57:01.060 align:middle line:84%
And they've cut
their CAPEX in half.

00:57:01.060 --> 00:57:04.009 align:middle line:84%
Production of gold
peaked in 2002.

00:57:04.009 --> 00:57:04.550 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: OK.

00:57:04.550 --> 00:57:07.100 align:middle line:84%
So really quickly, because
we're about out of time--

00:57:07.100 --> 00:57:08.027 align:middle line:90%
>>HOFFMAN: Yes.

00:57:08.027 --> 00:57:09.360 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: --what does that mean?

00:57:09.360 --> 00:57:11.151 align:middle line:84%
Are we going to have
a more difficult time?

00:57:11.151 --> 00:57:14.150 align:middle line:84%
People who want to kind of flee
to silver, gold, and so forth,

00:57:14.150 --> 00:57:15.450 align:middle line:84%
copper or whatever, is it
going to be more difficult?

00:57:15.450 --> 00:57:17.910 align:middle line:84%
>>HOFFMAN: Right now, the paper
prices don't tell this story.

00:57:17.910 --> 00:57:18.270 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: OK.

00:57:18.270 --> 00:57:20.270 align:middle line:84%
>>HOFFMAN: They are
suppressed more than ever.

00:57:20.270 --> 00:57:23.190 align:middle line:84%
And the physical demand, as we
talked about India and China,

00:57:23.190 --> 00:57:26.550 align:middle line:84%
is at an all-time high
accelerating, not just

00:57:26.550 --> 00:57:28.925 align:middle line:84%
going up, accelerating rapidly
from all-time high levels.

00:57:28.925 --> 00:57:30.549 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Still a
good idea then if you

00:57:30.549 --> 00:57:32.480 align:middle line:84%
can get your hands on
any silver or gold?

00:57:32.480 --> 00:57:34.188 align:middle line:84%
>>HOFFMAN: What will
end the bull market,

00:57:34.188 --> 00:57:37.220 align:middle line:84%
as we say at Miles Franklin,
is the lack of supply.

00:57:37.220 --> 00:57:38.344 align:middle line:90%
If you don't have it--

00:57:38.344 --> 00:57:39.010 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:57:39.010 --> 00:57:40.440 align:middle line:84%
>>HOFFMAN: --you're
never going to get it.

00:57:40.440 --> 00:57:40.981 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: OK.

00:57:40.981 --> 00:57:45.410 align:middle line:84%
So just a shining word
of good news anywhere?

00:57:45.410 --> 00:57:47.112 align:middle line:90%
We all have each other, right?

00:57:47.112 --> 00:57:49.570 align:middle line:84%
>>HOFFMAN: Well, the good news
is you can protect yourself.

00:57:49.570 --> 00:57:50.920 align:middle line:10%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:57:50.920 --> 00:57:52.620 align:middle line:10%
>>HOFFMAN: And not
just financially.

00:57:52.620 --> 00:57:54.990 align:middle line:10%
You can do so by
preparing for the worst

00:57:54.990 --> 00:57:56.040 align:middle line:10%
and hoping for the best.

00:57:56.040 --> 00:57:57.000 align:middle line:10%
>>REGINA: As always, yeah.

00:57:57.000 --> 00:57:58.810 align:middle line:10%
>>HOFFMAN: And in my world,
I'm in the financial world.

00:57:58.810 --> 00:58:00.309 align:middle line:10%
I don't talk about
the other things.

00:58:00.309 --> 00:58:03.180 align:middle line:84%
I say you still can
buy gold and silver now

00:58:03.180 --> 00:58:06.020 align:middle line:84%
below the cost of production
while it's still available

00:58:06.020 --> 00:58:08.216 align:middle line:84%
and protect your
family and your future.

00:58:08.216 --> 00:58:08.840 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:58:08.840 --> 00:58:11.465 align:middle line:84%
And I always say at this point,
and grow a garden or something.

00:58:11.465 --> 00:58:12.548 align:middle line:90%
>>HOFFMAN: Well, that too.

00:58:12.548 --> 00:58:13.810 align:middle line:90%
It's a good thing to do.

00:58:13.810 --> 00:58:14.020 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes, indeed.

00:58:14.020 --> 00:58:14.920 align:middle line:90%
Thank you so much, Andy.

00:58:14.920 --> 00:58:16.900 align:middle line:84%
We'll check back in another
four to six months--

00:58:16.900 --> 00:58:17.620 align:middle line:90%
>>HOFFMAN: I look forward to it.

00:58:17.620 --> 00:58:19.369 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: --see how
thing are progressing.

00:58:19.369 --> 00:58:21.499 align:middle line:10%
That was a belly full
of economic news.

00:58:21.499 --> 00:58:23.540 align:middle line:10%
And it all comes down to
staying alert and taking

00:58:23.540 --> 00:58:25.010 align:middle line:10%
care of the basics.

00:58:25.010 --> 00:58:27.460 align:middle line:84%
This isn't meant to alarm
anyone, only to educate.

00:58:27.460 --> 00:58:31.610 align:middle line:84%
Until next time, thank you for
joining us here on Gaiam TV.
