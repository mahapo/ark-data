>>REGINA MEREDITH:
30 years ago, a group

00:00:21.350 --> 00:00:24.740 align:middle line:10%
of little beings in monks'
robes appeared to Penny Kelly

00:00:24.740 --> 00:00:26.640 align:middle line:10%
after a Kundalini awakening.

00:00:26.640 --> 00:00:28.860 align:middle line:10%
They showed her visions
of future Earth,

00:00:28.860 --> 00:00:31.450 align:middle line:10%
which was chronicled in
her books, The Robes.

00:00:31.450 --> 00:00:34.460 align:middle line:84%
Today, we're going to move the
story both forward and backward

00:00:34.460 --> 00:00:37.400 align:middle line:84%
and look at where in
the process of creating

00:00:37.400 --> 00:00:38.800 align:middle line:90%
by way of our future.

00:00:38.800 --> 00:00:39.968 align:middle line:90%
Welcome, Penny.

00:00:39.968 --> 00:00:41.010 align:middle line:90%
>>PENNY KELLY: Thank you.

00:00:41.010 --> 00:00:42.540 align:middle line:90%
It's really exciting to be here.

00:00:42.540 --> 00:00:43.340 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: It's fun.

00:00:43.340 --> 00:00:45.540 align:middle line:84%
I mean, I've interviewed
you offline elsewhere,

00:00:45.540 --> 00:00:48.220 align:middle line:84%
but we've never met
person-to-person until now,

00:00:48.220 --> 00:00:49.020 align:middle line:90%
through the years.

00:00:49.020 --> 00:00:50.020 align:middle line:90%
So it's good to see you.

00:00:50.020 --> 00:00:52.400 align:middle line:84%
And you're very
beloved by people.

00:00:52.400 --> 00:00:55.250 align:middle line:84%
And there is such
a sweetness to you

00:00:55.250 --> 00:00:57.390 align:middle line:84%
that you carry forward
through your information.

00:00:57.390 --> 00:00:58.640 align:middle line:90%
And I can see why so.

00:00:58.640 --> 00:01:00.440 align:middle line:84%
Sometimes, it's nice
to be in the flesh.

00:01:00.440 --> 00:01:02.330 align:middle line:90%
You really pick that up.

00:01:02.330 --> 00:01:03.432 align:middle line:90%
>>KELLY: I like people.

00:01:03.432 --> 00:01:04.890 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Yeah,
you do like people.

00:01:04.890 --> 00:01:04.970 align:middle line:90%
>>KELLY: Yeah.

00:01:04.970 --> 00:01:07.580 align:middle line:10%
>>REGINA: So, Penny, let's
talk for the audience

00:01:07.580 --> 00:01:09.270 align:middle line:10%
that does not know you.

00:01:09.270 --> 00:01:12.930 align:middle line:90%
Let's go back to 1980, '81--

00:01:12.930 --> 00:01:14.790 align:middle line:90%
'80 or '81, right in there.

00:01:14.790 --> 00:01:17.220 align:middle line:84%
>>KELLY: Oh, '80,
'81, part of '82.

00:01:17.220 --> 00:01:18.020 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: OK.

00:01:18.020 --> 00:01:22.800 align:middle line:10%
Back to that time, yeah,
42, 43 years ago now.

00:01:22.800 --> 00:01:26.310 align:middle line:10%
And talk about what your
life was like at the time

00:01:26.310 --> 00:01:27.790 align:middle line:10%
and what happened to you.

00:01:27.790 --> 00:01:30.600 align:middle line:10%
And then we'll start
moving the story forward.

00:01:30.600 --> 00:01:33.990 align:middle line:10%
>>KELLY: At the time, I was
an engineer for Chrysler,

00:01:33.990 --> 00:01:38.560 align:middle line:10%
and I was not into anything
spiritual, nothing.

00:01:38.560 --> 00:01:43.420 align:middle line:10%
And then boom, there was this
massive Kundalini experience,

00:01:43.420 --> 00:01:44.770 align:middle line:10%
a whole series of them.

00:01:44.770 --> 00:01:47.710 align:middle line:10%
In fact, Kundalini
is an ongoing thing.

00:01:47.710 --> 00:01:51.670 align:middle line:10%
It's not just a one time deal,
or it hasn't been for me.

00:01:51.670 --> 00:01:57.690 align:middle line:84%
But overnight, I knew a whole
bunch that I didn't know before.

00:01:57.690 --> 00:02:01.860 align:middle line:84%
I understood who I was,
what I was doing here.

00:02:01.860 --> 00:02:06.090 align:middle line:84%
Overnight, you are psychic,
clairvoyant, clairaudient,

00:02:06.090 --> 00:02:07.860 align:middle line:90%
clairsentient.

00:02:07.860 --> 00:02:11.370 align:middle line:10%
It was a very hard transition.

00:02:11.370 --> 00:02:13.890 align:middle line:10%
>>REGINA: I can imagine,
but what a gift.

00:02:13.890 --> 00:02:16.140 align:middle line:10%
A lot of people
that are wandering

00:02:16.140 --> 00:02:18.940 align:middle line:10%
around the Earth throughout
incarnations are saying,

00:02:18.940 --> 00:02:19.990 align:middle line:10%
what am I doing here?

00:02:19.990 --> 00:02:21.100 align:middle line:10%
What am I here for?

00:02:21.100 --> 00:02:23.530 align:middle line:84%
I mean, all the way up
to leaving their bodies.

00:02:23.530 --> 00:02:25.830 align:middle line:84%
So you're very
fortunate that you

00:02:25.830 --> 00:02:28.912 align:middle line:84%
were able to get a glimpse
at a young age of who you are

00:02:28.912 --> 00:02:30.870 align:middle line:84%
and what you're here to
do because you gave you

00:02:30.870 --> 00:02:32.110 align:middle line:90%
a lot of years to do it in.

00:02:32.110 --> 00:02:33.027 align:middle line:90%
>>KELLY: That's right.

00:02:33.027 --> 00:02:34.050 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHTER]

00:02:34.050 --> 00:02:36.940 align:middle line:84%
I didn't think of it that
way, but that's correct.

00:02:36.940 --> 00:02:40.200 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So let's talk
about then the appearance

00:02:40.200 --> 00:02:43.518 align:middle line:84%
of the little beings, almost
like little monks in robes.

00:02:43.518 --> 00:02:44.560 align:middle line:90%
>>KELLY: Yeah, they were.

00:02:44.560 --> 00:02:47.730 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Yeah, let's start
talking about how they first

00:02:47.730 --> 00:02:51.660 align:middle line:84%
came in and what the
whole experience of them

00:02:51.660 --> 00:02:54.570 align:middle line:84%
was, and then the
revelations that they

00:02:54.570 --> 00:02:55.770 align:middle line:90%
started sharing with you.

00:02:55.770 --> 00:02:58.380 align:middle line:90%
You can take your time on this.

00:02:58.380 --> 00:03:02.290 align:middle line:84%
>>KELLY: They appeared
on a winter night,

00:03:02.290 --> 00:03:04.000 align:middle line:90%
I think it was in January.

00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:08.130 align:middle line:84%
And it was one of
those moments where I'm

00:03:08.130 --> 00:03:09.865 align:middle line:90%
at the sink, peeling potatoes--

00:03:09.865 --> 00:03:10.740 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Of course--

00:03:10.740 --> 00:03:12.220 align:middle line:84%
>>KELLY: --getting
ready to make dinner.

00:03:12.220 --> 00:03:14.100 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: --that's what
happens when you peel potatoes

00:03:14.100 --> 00:03:14.660 align:middle line:90%
at the sink.

00:03:14.660 --> 00:03:15.300 align:middle line:90%
>>KELLY: Yeah.

00:03:15.300 --> 00:03:16.150 align:middle line:90%
I know.

00:03:16.150 --> 00:03:18.090 align:middle line:84%
And all of a sudden,
you get this feeling

00:03:18.090 --> 00:03:19.840 align:middle line:90%
that you're not alone.

00:03:19.840 --> 00:03:22.780 align:middle line:84%
And it was just
this creepy feeling.

00:03:22.780 --> 00:03:25.320 align:middle line:10%
And I turned around
and looked, and there

00:03:25.320 --> 00:03:28.320 align:middle line:10%
were these seven
little men wearing

00:03:28.320 --> 00:03:31.260 align:middle line:10%
these brown robes
that looked like monks

00:03:31.260 --> 00:03:32.860 align:middle line:10%
standing in the kitchen.

00:03:32.860 --> 00:03:36.687 align:middle line:90%
And I was not very graceful.

00:03:36.687 --> 00:03:38.020 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah, what did you do?

00:03:38.020 --> 00:03:39.900 align:middle line:90%
Did you freak out?

00:03:39.900 --> 00:03:40.870 align:middle line:90%
>>KELLY: I did.

00:03:40.870 --> 00:03:45.240 align:middle line:84%
I freaked out, and I had
been because of Kundalini.

00:03:45.240 --> 00:03:49.860 align:middle line:84%
Kundalini is, for me,
started with reading minds

00:03:49.860 --> 00:03:53.070 align:middle line:84%
and understanding what people
were thinking and seeing

00:03:53.070 --> 00:03:54.090 align:middle line:90%
the future.

00:03:54.090 --> 00:03:56.940 align:middle line:84%
All that kind of
thing, and so I was

00:03:56.940 --> 00:04:01.450 align:middle line:84%
trying to wipe that away all
the time and go back to normal.

00:04:01.450 --> 00:04:03.760 align:middle line:84%
And now here's these
seven little men.

00:04:03.760 --> 00:04:06.810 align:middle line:84%
And I thought for
a minute, OK, I'm

00:04:06.810 --> 00:04:09.900 align:middle line:90%
having another crazy perception?

00:04:09.900 --> 00:04:15.300 align:middle line:84%
And then they started
talking and I just, blah.

00:04:15.300 --> 00:04:16.140 align:middle line:90%
So I ran--

00:04:16.140 --> 00:04:17.265 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: I can't hear you.

00:04:17.265 --> 00:04:19.580 align:middle line:10%
[LAUGHTER]

00:04:19.580 --> 00:04:20.380 align:middle line:90%
>>KELLY: Yeah.

00:04:20.380 --> 00:04:23.580 align:middle line:84%
If I had known, I would
have gone la, la, la, la.

00:04:23.580 --> 00:04:26.800 align:middle line:84%
I ended up running
away into the bedroom,

00:04:26.800 --> 00:04:30.400 align:middle line:84%
climbing under the covers,
trying to make them go away.

00:04:30.400 --> 00:04:32.020 align:middle line:84%
And they came to
the bedroom door,

00:04:32.020 --> 00:04:33.700 align:middle line:90%
which freaked me out even more.

00:04:33.700 --> 00:04:38.800 align:middle line:84%
And they were so bright and
so polite and so cheerful.

00:04:38.800 --> 00:04:41.550 align:middle line:10%
And they said, well,
we'll be back when you're

00:04:41.550 --> 00:04:44.460 align:middle line:10%
having a better time of it.

00:04:44.460 --> 00:04:48.510 align:middle line:84%
And so they let me know
that they weren't giving up.

00:04:48.510 --> 00:04:52.560 align:middle line:84%
And so then they came
back again some time later

00:04:52.560 --> 00:04:55.360 align:middle line:90%
and I ignored them and was rude.

00:04:55.360 --> 00:04:57.702 align:middle line:84%
And that went against
everything in me.

00:04:57.702 --> 00:04:59.410 align:middle line:10%
>>REGINA: Yeah, you're
not a rude person.

00:04:59.410 --> 00:05:00.210 align:middle line:10%
>>KELLY: No.

00:05:00.210 --> 00:05:05.770 align:middle line:10%
And I was raised to be polite,
and so then I felt guilty.

00:05:05.770 --> 00:05:07.980 align:middle line:84%
So then they came
back the third time

00:05:07.980 --> 00:05:11.400 align:middle line:84%
and I thought, OK, they wanted
to show me some pictures.

00:05:11.400 --> 00:05:14.060 align:middle line:90%
And I thought, OK.

00:05:14.060 --> 00:05:17.450 align:middle line:84%
I'm going to look at the
pictures and they'll go away.

00:05:17.450 --> 00:05:20.780 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So at any point,
did they identify who they

00:05:20.780 --> 00:05:22.850 align:middle line:90%
were, where they were from.

00:05:22.850 --> 00:05:25.530 align:middle line:84%
They just showed up and said,
we have pictures to show you.

00:05:25.530 --> 00:05:26.130 align:middle line:90%
>>KELLY: That's right.

00:05:26.130 --> 00:05:26.930 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: OK.

00:05:26.930 --> 00:05:29.520 align:middle line:10%
>>KELLY: I did hear
a little bit later,

00:05:29.520 --> 00:05:36.080 align:middle line:10%
and I have learned since then
that there are groups of people

00:05:36.080 --> 00:05:41.730 align:middle line:10%
who go around the planet or
the cosmos, the solar system,

00:05:41.730 --> 00:05:46.190 align:middle line:10%
and they look for people
whose lights have turned on.

00:05:46.190 --> 00:05:49.080 align:middle line:84%
And when you have a
Kundalini experience,

00:05:49.080 --> 00:05:52.100 align:middle line:84%
your energy field
lights up and it

00:05:52.100 --> 00:05:56.940 align:middle line:84%
becomes about three times
bigger than it normally is.

00:05:56.940 --> 00:06:02.445 align:middle line:84%
And they know that's somebody
who's going to have trouble.

00:06:02.445 --> 00:06:05.380 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: So they set up beacon.

00:06:05.380 --> 00:06:06.200 align:middle line:90%
You just lit up.

00:06:06.200 --> 00:06:07.000 align:middle line:90%
We got to go.

00:06:07.000 --> 00:06:08.580 align:middle line:90%
So they found you.

00:06:08.580 --> 00:06:10.290 align:middle line:84%
OK, so now what
about the pictures

00:06:10.290 --> 00:06:11.410 align:middle line:90%
they wanted to show you.

00:06:11.410 --> 00:06:12.210 align:middle line:90%
>>KELLY: Oh, wow.

00:06:12.210 --> 00:06:15.350 align:middle line:10%
So the pictures, the very
first pictures were--

00:06:15.350 --> 00:06:17.010 align:middle line:10%
they said, come with us.

00:06:17.010 --> 00:06:19.900 align:middle line:90%
So we left the body.

00:06:19.900 --> 00:06:21.990 align:middle line:84%
That's another thing
that goes with Kundalini

00:06:21.990 --> 00:06:27.660 align:middle line:84%
in and out of the body,
OBEs at will anytime.

00:06:27.660 --> 00:06:32.130 align:middle line:10%
And so they took me out and we
were out away from the planet

00:06:32.130 --> 00:06:34.620 align:middle line:10%
enough to see the whole planet.

00:06:34.620 --> 00:06:38.130 align:middle line:84%
And it was just kind
of hanging there

00:06:38.130 --> 00:06:40.510 align:middle line:90%
and I'm like, what are we doing?

00:06:40.510 --> 00:06:41.740 align:middle line:90%
What is this about?

00:06:41.740 --> 00:06:44.220 align:middle line:84%
And all of a sudden,
the planet rocked.

00:06:44.220 --> 00:06:49.590 align:middle line:10%
And the ocean splashed and
it was not a pretty sight.

00:06:49.590 --> 00:06:55.590 align:middle line:90%
And I thought, well, OK, so--

00:06:55.590 --> 00:07:01.380 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Was it indicating like
a polar shift or an axis shift?

00:07:01.380 --> 00:07:02.950 align:middle line:10%
>>KELLY: There are
several things.

00:07:02.950 --> 00:07:05.070 align:middle line:10%
We do have polar shifts.

00:07:05.070 --> 00:07:07.790 align:middle line:10%
We do have axis shifts.

00:07:07.790 --> 00:07:09.160 align:middle line:90%
Actually, the planet shifts.

00:07:09.160 --> 00:07:10.620 align:middle line:90%
The axis doesn't.

00:07:10.620 --> 00:07:14.850 align:middle line:84%
We do have solar flashes
that will bump the planet.

00:07:14.850 --> 00:07:17.220 align:middle line:84%
And we also have
these little, I'm

00:07:17.220 --> 00:07:21.360 align:middle line:84%
going to call it these little
wobbles, extra wobbles that

00:07:21.360 --> 00:07:22.270 align:middle line:90%
occur.

00:07:22.270 --> 00:07:28.560 align:middle line:10%
And they cause flooding, major
flooding around the planet,

00:07:28.560 --> 00:07:30.900 align:middle line:10%
wipes out a lot of people
because a lot of people

00:07:30.900 --> 00:07:32.340 align:middle line:10%
live on the coast.

00:07:32.340 --> 00:07:36.900 align:middle line:10%
And so I was like, now, wait
a minute, wait a minute.

00:07:36.900 --> 00:07:40.000 align:middle line:10%
I wasn't sure I wanted
to keep looking.

00:07:40.000 --> 00:07:42.170 align:middle line:10%
I thought it was too fantastic.

00:07:42.170 --> 00:07:45.690 align:middle line:84%
I had an engineer's
brain at that point.

00:07:45.690 --> 00:07:49.020 align:middle line:84%
So part of me was
going, what happened?

00:07:49.020 --> 00:07:50.020 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: What was that?

00:07:50.020 --> 00:07:51.060 align:middle line:90%
>>KELLY: Yeah, exactly.

00:07:51.060 --> 00:07:52.030 align:middle line:90%
How and why?

00:07:52.030 --> 00:07:54.340 align:middle line:84%
Those are my favorite
questions in the world.

00:07:54.340 --> 00:07:58.990 align:middle line:10%
They ended up saying,
this kind of thing

00:07:58.990 --> 00:08:01.520 align:middle line:10%
is mother nature
healing herself.

00:08:01.520 --> 00:08:03.620 align:middle line:10%
It's the planet healing herself.

00:08:03.620 --> 00:08:05.080 align:middle line:10%
She's a living being.

00:08:05.080 --> 00:08:08.770 align:middle line:90%
And I was like, what?

00:08:08.770 --> 00:08:13.930 align:middle line:84%
So in the end, it really
was a situation where

00:08:13.930 --> 00:08:15.900 align:middle line:90%
that was the first thing I saw.

00:08:15.900 --> 00:08:16.900 align:middle line:90%
And then they came back.

00:08:16.900 --> 00:08:19.590 align:middle line:84%
And each time they
came back for the next

00:08:19.590 --> 00:08:23.450 align:middle line:84%
like-- there were probably
18 to 20 visits altogether.

00:08:23.450 --> 00:08:27.670 align:middle line:10%
I wrote about 16
of them in my book,

00:08:27.670 --> 00:08:32.860 align:middle line:10%
but each time they addressed a
different part of reality for us

00:08:32.860 --> 00:08:33.669 align:middle line:10%
here.

00:08:33.669 --> 00:08:37.460 align:middle line:10%
Governance, they said
everything that's happening now,

00:08:37.460 --> 00:08:38.260 align:middle line:10%
I saw all that.

00:08:38.260 --> 00:08:39.177 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Must change.

00:08:39.177 --> 00:08:40.270 align:middle line:90%
>>KELLY: Yeah.

00:08:40.270 --> 00:08:45.260 align:middle line:84%
And they said, it's because
you've outgrown your system.

00:08:45.260 --> 00:08:47.720 align:middle line:90%
You have to move up.

00:08:47.720 --> 00:08:51.110 align:middle line:84%
And at the time, I wasn't
sure what that meant.

00:08:51.110 --> 00:08:52.510 align:middle line:90%
Now, I get that.

00:08:52.510 --> 00:08:53.920 align:middle line:90%
That's very clear now.

00:08:53.920 --> 00:08:56.960 align:middle line:10%
We're moving to
4D and 5D people,

00:08:56.960 --> 00:08:59.840 align:middle line:10%
and that's a whole different
kind of consciousness.

00:08:59.840 --> 00:09:02.930 align:middle line:10%
So over the course
of those visits,

00:09:02.930 --> 00:09:07.930 align:middle line:10%
I learned that the
future was ours to create

00:09:07.930 --> 00:09:11.020 align:middle line:10%
and that we needed
to begin creating.

00:09:11.020 --> 00:09:12.760 align:middle line:10%
This was the bottom line.

00:09:12.760 --> 00:09:17.150 align:middle line:10%
That bottom line, I think
we're at that right now.

00:09:17.150 --> 00:09:21.770 align:middle line:10%
It's time to do something
that's very positive, wonderful,

00:09:21.770 --> 00:09:22.780 align:middle line:10%
creative.

00:09:22.780 --> 00:09:24.826 align:middle line:90%
That's kind of sassy.

00:09:24.826 --> 00:09:25.690 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Hm-mm.

00:09:25.690 --> 00:09:28.480 align:middle line:84%
Oh, yes, in fact,
I've interviewed

00:09:28.480 --> 00:09:30.617 align:middle line:90%
various channeled groups.

00:09:30.617 --> 00:09:32.200 align:middle line:84%
I have a few people
who are channelers

00:09:32.200 --> 00:09:34.570 align:middle line:84%
and their groups I've come
to know over the years

00:09:34.570 --> 00:09:35.540 align:middle line:90%
and talked to them.

00:09:35.540 --> 00:09:39.250 align:middle line:10%
And it almost seems
to be a consensus

00:09:39.250 --> 00:09:42.680 align:middle line:10%
that we have reached
the tipping point,

00:09:42.680 --> 00:09:44.870 align:middle line:10%
but we actually tipped over.

00:09:44.870 --> 00:09:46.768 align:middle line:84%
We've just slipped
over where [EXHALES]

00:09:46.768 --> 00:09:47.685 align:middle line:90%
>>KELLY: That's right.

00:09:47.685 --> 00:09:49.400 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: OK, you guys
are going to make it.

00:09:49.400 --> 00:09:50.270 align:middle line:90%
You're going to be fine.

00:09:50.270 --> 00:09:50.680 align:middle line:90%
>>KELLY: I know.

00:09:50.680 --> 00:09:52.097 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: You're
going to be fine.

00:09:52.097 --> 00:09:55.090 align:middle line:84%
We made it past that scary
point that people were so scared

00:09:55.090 --> 00:09:58.740 align:middle line:84%
of if it existed in real terms
the way we know it at all.

00:09:58.740 --> 00:09:59.540 align:middle line:90%
We don't know.

00:09:59.540 --> 00:10:01.770 align:middle line:84%
These things are put in
our vision for a reason.

00:10:01.770 --> 00:10:02.320 align:middle line:90%
>>KELLY: We don't want to know.

00:10:02.320 --> 00:10:03.350 align:middle line:10%
>>REGINA: We don't want to know.

00:10:03.350 --> 00:10:05.290 align:middle line:10%
And sometimes, things
are shown to us in a way

00:10:05.290 --> 00:10:07.220 align:middle line:10%
that we need to see
it to take action.

00:10:07.220 --> 00:10:09.730 align:middle line:84%
But they all say,
you have to know,

00:10:09.730 --> 00:10:13.210 align:middle line:84%
these systems are going to
crumble in an incredible chaos

00:10:13.210 --> 00:10:14.083 align:middle line:90%
for a while here.

00:10:14.083 --> 00:10:15.000 align:middle line:90%
>>KELLY: That's right.

00:10:15.000 --> 00:10:16.417 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And we're
going to have,

00:10:16.417 --> 00:10:19.290 align:middle line:84%
you tell us what you were
seeing and what that looks like.

00:10:19.290 --> 00:10:21.360 align:middle line:10%
And we've been told
this repeatedly,

00:10:21.360 --> 00:10:24.860 align:middle line:10%
where you're going into a
good 8, 10 years of chaos,

00:10:24.860 --> 00:10:27.510 align:middle line:10%
but that's OK, because
you're going to make it.

00:10:27.510 --> 00:10:30.300 align:middle line:84%
And so you've got to let the
old crumble to build the new.

00:10:30.300 --> 00:10:33.290 align:middle line:84%
So let's talk about what
they showed to you and how--

00:10:33.290 --> 00:10:34.790 align:middle line:84%
and because there
are so many things

00:10:34.790 --> 00:10:36.150 align:middle line:90%
you were shown about the future.

00:10:36.150 --> 00:10:36.950 align:middle line:90%
>>KELLY: Yeah.

00:10:36.950 --> 00:10:38.640 align:middle line:90%
Yeah, there was a lot.

00:10:38.640 --> 00:10:41.540 align:middle line:84%
The things that really
caught my attention

00:10:41.540 --> 00:10:44.700 align:middle line:84%
were bombs going off
in a lot of places.

00:10:44.700 --> 00:10:47.450 align:middle line:84%
First, there were
the two big incidents

00:10:47.450 --> 00:10:50.420 align:middle line:84%
at the Trade
Center, the one that

00:10:50.420 --> 00:10:53.520 align:middle line:84%
didn't work very well and
then the one that did.

00:10:53.520 --> 00:10:54.320 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:10:54.320 --> 00:10:56.550 align:middle line:84%
And in the Timothy
McVeigh versus 9/11.

00:10:56.550 --> 00:11:00.410 align:middle line:10%
>>KELLY: No, there was an
original bombing at the Trade

00:11:00.410 --> 00:11:02.900 align:middle line:10%
Center, but it
didn't do the damage

00:11:02.900 --> 00:11:05.790 align:middle line:10%
that they intended it to do, so
they went back and did it again.

00:11:05.790 --> 00:11:06.590 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: OK.

00:11:06.590 --> 00:11:07.020 align:middle line:90%
All right.

00:11:07.020 --> 00:11:08.270 align:middle line:90%
>>KELLY: So I saw that.

00:11:08.270 --> 00:11:11.870 align:middle line:84%
But the thing that
really broke my heart

00:11:11.870 --> 00:11:15.820 align:middle line:84%
was watching the
decay of the cities,

00:11:15.820 --> 00:11:20.720 align:middle line:84%
and the people who
lived in those cities,

00:11:20.720 --> 00:11:24.200 align:middle line:84%
they were having
difficulties of every sort.

00:11:24.200 --> 00:11:25.310 align:middle line:90%
They didn't have food.

00:11:25.310 --> 00:11:26.810 align:middle line:90%
They couldn't get water.

00:11:26.810 --> 00:11:30.100 align:middle line:10%
There were gangs
that were roaming

00:11:30.100 --> 00:11:35.200 align:middle line:10%
around that were not helpful.

00:11:35.200 --> 00:11:39.130 align:middle line:84%
Some gangs were organizing
people, but most of them

00:11:39.130 --> 00:11:40.280 align:middle line:90%
were not.

00:11:40.280 --> 00:11:43.070 align:middle line:90%
So that was very upsetting.

00:11:43.070 --> 00:11:45.230 align:middle line:84%
A lot of people died
from starvation.

00:11:45.230 --> 00:11:47.810 align:middle line:90%


00:11:47.810 --> 00:11:50.510 align:middle line:84%
I saw some things that
just freaked me out

00:11:50.510 --> 00:11:52.790 align:middle line:84%
in terms of people
eating people.

00:11:52.790 --> 00:11:54.500 align:middle line:90%
It was not good.

00:11:54.500 --> 00:11:59.180 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: It was a timeline
that went into a very desperate.

00:11:59.180 --> 00:12:00.230 align:middle line:90%
>>KELLY: Desperation.

00:12:00.230 --> 00:12:01.030 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:12:01.030 --> 00:12:03.120 align:middle line:10%
Desperate ending, or
on an ending pathway.

00:12:03.120 --> 00:12:04.920 align:middle line:90%
>>KELLY: Yeah, right.

00:12:04.920 --> 00:12:08.390 align:middle line:10%
Yeah, and then little
by little, after we

00:12:08.390 --> 00:12:12.740 align:middle line:10%
had covered what had to happen
with the governance system, what

00:12:12.740 --> 00:12:14.990 align:middle line:10%
had to happen with
business, what had to happen

00:12:14.990 --> 00:12:18.680 align:middle line:10%
with our ideas
about family and sex

00:12:18.680 --> 00:12:22.050 align:middle line:10%
and raising children and money.

00:12:22.050 --> 00:12:25.410 align:middle line:84%
All of all of that
affected me deeply.

00:12:25.410 --> 00:12:27.050 align:middle line:84%
And then they went
into and here's

00:12:27.050 --> 00:12:29.030 align:middle line:90%
what you're moving toward.

00:12:29.030 --> 00:12:31.455 align:middle line:90%
And that was-- it was magical.

00:12:31.455 --> 00:12:33.080 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So what
were they showing you

00:12:33.080 --> 00:12:36.890 align:middle line:84%
about by way of connection
and family back in 1980,

00:12:36.890 --> 00:12:40.500 align:middle line:84%
'81 that you would be
alerted to see in the future?

00:12:40.500 --> 00:12:42.110 align:middle line:84%
>>KELLY: The biggest
thing was what

00:12:42.110 --> 00:12:44.960 align:middle line:84%
would happen in the
schools, and that would

00:12:44.960 --> 00:12:48.030 align:middle line:90%
help to destroy the family.

00:12:48.030 --> 00:12:52.020 align:middle line:10%
The second thing was
the medical issue

00:12:52.020 --> 00:12:56.960 align:middle line:10%
that would take place
and the call for ID.

00:12:56.960 --> 00:13:00.980 align:middle line:84%
Medical ID, and that
would not be good.

00:13:00.980 --> 00:13:04.470 align:middle line:84%
The family just was
breaking down at every turn.

00:13:04.470 --> 00:13:09.500 align:middle line:84%
And they said, you cannot send
your children away to school

00:13:09.500 --> 00:13:12.940 align:middle line:84%
because the school isn't
teaching them anything,

00:13:12.940 --> 00:13:13.740 align:middle line:90%
number one.

00:13:13.740 --> 00:13:15.320 align:middle line:84%
And all you're
teaching the child

00:13:15.320 --> 00:13:20.726 align:middle line:84%
is that they're not important,
and they have to be sent away.

00:13:20.726 --> 00:13:23.690 align:middle line:10%
And that was just like, oh, wow.

00:13:23.690 --> 00:13:27.410 align:middle line:84%
Then later, when I became
an educational consultant

00:13:27.410 --> 00:13:31.250 align:middle line:84%
and I actually worked in
schools, then I realized,

00:13:31.250 --> 00:13:32.520 align:middle line:90%
yeah, they're right.

00:13:32.520 --> 00:13:33.320 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Oh, yeah.

00:13:33.320 --> 00:13:34.778 align:middle line:84%
>>KELLY: They were
more than right.

00:13:34.778 --> 00:13:39.830 align:middle line:84%
So that all of that
breakdown was hard to see.

00:13:39.830 --> 00:13:40.928 align:middle line:90%
It was hard to watch.

00:13:40.928 --> 00:13:42.720 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: But a lot of
it has come to pass.

00:13:42.720 --> 00:13:44.835 align:middle line:84%
And now, let me just
ask you, I mean,

00:13:44.835 --> 00:13:45.960 align:middle line:90%
it gets a little political.

00:13:45.960 --> 00:13:47.840 align:middle line:84%
We're not meaning it
in a political way.

00:13:47.840 --> 00:13:50.910 align:middle line:10%
But when COVID happened, cities
broke down all over the world.

00:13:50.910 --> 00:13:53.690 align:middle line:84%
Supply chains in general
were disrupted everywhere

00:13:53.690 --> 00:13:54.660 align:middle line:90%
around the planet.

00:13:54.660 --> 00:13:57.870 align:middle line:10%
There's not a country that
didn't suffer and isn't still

00:13:57.870 --> 00:14:00.540 align:middle line:10%
suffering from the
effects of what happened

00:14:00.540 --> 00:14:02.440 align:middle line:10%
to supply chain breakdowns.

00:14:02.440 --> 00:14:06.960 align:middle line:84%
And you had some countries
that took it a little further

00:14:06.960 --> 00:14:10.428 align:middle line:84%
and started talking about
potential vaccine passports

00:14:10.428 --> 00:14:11.970 align:middle line:84%
where you couldn't
leave the country.

00:14:11.970 --> 00:14:13.740 align:middle line:10%
And some countries
did this where

00:14:13.740 --> 00:14:15.300 align:middle line:10%
you can't leave your
country or enter

00:14:15.300 --> 00:14:20.220 align:middle line:10%
a country unless it shows that
you have your vaccination card.

00:14:20.220 --> 00:14:21.610 align:middle line:10%
Official vaccination card.

00:14:21.610 --> 00:14:23.580 align:middle line:10%
Is that some of
what-- when that all

00:14:23.580 --> 00:14:25.150 align:middle line:10%
happened, did you
think, oh, my God,

00:14:25.150 --> 00:14:26.920 align:middle line:10%
that's kind of what
I was looking at?

00:14:26.920 --> 00:14:29.460 align:middle line:84%
>>KELLY: I had a hard
time believing that.

00:14:29.460 --> 00:14:34.110 align:middle line:84%
I kept thinking, there's
no way that the US or any

00:14:34.110 --> 00:14:37.060 align:middle line:84%
of the Western countries
are going to come to that.

00:14:37.060 --> 00:14:39.460 align:middle line:84%
And so I didn't put
much in the book.

00:14:39.460 --> 00:14:45.060 align:middle line:10%
I just mentioned that there
was a call for medical ID.

00:14:45.060 --> 00:14:47.800 align:middle line:10%
And let it go at that.

00:14:47.800 --> 00:14:50.682 align:middle line:84%
The message that
went with that was

00:14:50.682 --> 00:14:53.820 align:middle line:84%
that we were damned
if we did and damned

00:14:53.820 --> 00:14:58.885 align:middle line:84%
if we didn't institute
that medical procedure.

00:14:58.885 --> 00:15:01.260 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Tell us what that
means damned if we did versus

00:15:01.260 --> 00:15:02.060 align:middle line:90%
didn't.

00:15:02.060 --> 00:15:04.360 align:middle line:10%
>>KELLY: That if
we didn't do it,

00:15:04.360 --> 00:15:08.130 align:middle line:10%
it would mean that the whole
system was breaking down.

00:15:08.130 --> 00:15:10.110 align:middle line:84%
And that's really
where they wanted

00:15:10.110 --> 00:15:14.010 align:middle line:84%
us to go because they said,
you've outgrown your system.

00:15:14.010 --> 00:15:19.410 align:middle line:84%
And if we did do it, we would
move into a totalitarian set up

00:15:19.410 --> 00:15:21.510 align:middle line:90%
and be very unhappy.

00:15:21.510 --> 00:15:24.235 align:middle line:84%
And that would blow
up down the line.

00:15:24.235 --> 00:15:25.860 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Fortunately,
it seems to have

00:15:25.860 --> 00:15:28.470 align:middle line:84%
been mitigated or
bypassed for the most

00:15:28.470 --> 00:15:30.170 align:middle line:90%
part in most of the world.

00:15:30.170 --> 00:15:31.140 align:middle line:90%
>>KELLY: Inch by inch

00:15:31.140 --> 00:15:32.740 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah, yeah.

00:15:32.740 --> 00:15:34.440 align:middle line:90%
Yeah, tiptoed around that one.

00:15:34.440 --> 00:15:38.700 align:middle line:10%
But nonetheless, we don't
know what the future holds,

00:15:38.700 --> 00:15:43.903 align:middle line:10%
because if the notion that we
were to have had this system

00:15:43.903 --> 00:15:45.570 align:middle line:10%
fall apart and destroyed
and we're still

00:15:45.570 --> 00:15:48.560 align:middle line:10%
in that chaotic process, there
could be another one of these

00:15:48.560 --> 00:15:49.360 align:middle line:10%
comes along.

00:15:49.360 --> 00:15:53.470 align:middle line:10%
And we could, as a globe, as a
people, react very differently

00:15:53.470 --> 00:15:54.540 align:middle line:10%
and what do you see.

00:15:54.540 --> 00:15:59.462 align:middle line:84%
And now in terms of, well,
our human development,

00:15:59.462 --> 00:16:02.020 align:middle line:84%
how would we resolve
that next time you think?

00:16:02.020 --> 00:16:06.780 align:middle line:84%
>>KELLY: OK, to really
answer that honestly, I

00:16:06.780 --> 00:16:12.327 align:middle line:84%
have to go into why
I'm actually here.

00:16:12.327 --> 00:16:14.160 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: OK, just so
you know, so you don't

00:16:14.160 --> 00:16:15.600 align:middle line:90%
have to feel uncomfortable.

00:16:15.600 --> 00:16:17.260 align:middle line:10%
I've interviewed
Dr. Linda Backman,

00:16:17.260 --> 00:16:19.470 align:middle line:10%
who talks about all the
different kinds of souls

00:16:19.470 --> 00:16:22.230 align:middle line:10%
from different planets,
interplanetary,

00:16:22.230 --> 00:16:24.640 align:middle line:10%
ET species that are
third dimensional,

00:16:24.640 --> 00:16:26.070 align:middle line:10%
others that are here.

00:16:26.070 --> 00:16:27.390 align:middle line:90%
There are all kinds--

00:16:27.390 --> 00:16:29.740 align:middle line:84%
we're all kind of hybrids
of one kind or another.

00:16:29.740 --> 00:16:31.440 align:middle line:84%
So whatever you
have to say will not

00:16:31.440 --> 00:16:33.834 align:middle line:90%
be unfamiliar to this audience.

00:16:33.834 --> 00:16:34.634 align:middle line:90%
>>KELLY: OK.

00:16:34.634 --> 00:16:37.950 align:middle line:84%
So there's been an effort
to take over planet

00:16:37.950 --> 00:16:40.410 align:middle line:90%
Earth for a very long time.

00:16:40.410 --> 00:16:46.560 align:middle line:10%
That takeover effort is being
countered by other people

00:16:46.560 --> 00:16:47.590 align:middle line:10%
from elsewhere.

00:16:47.590 --> 00:16:48.450 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:16:48.450 --> 00:16:52.960 align:middle line:84%
So when it got to be
a critical moment,

00:16:52.960 --> 00:16:57.870 align:middle line:84%
there was a call that went out
and that call was for volunteers

00:16:57.870 --> 00:17:00.540 align:middle line:90%
to be born into the system.

00:17:00.540 --> 00:17:03.700 align:middle line:90%
And so I volunteered.

00:17:03.700 --> 00:17:09.660 align:middle line:84%
A lot of training went into
that, and I was put on a team.

00:17:09.660 --> 00:17:13.810 align:middle line:10%
There are four teams here
and one team is media,

00:17:13.810 --> 00:17:16.290 align:middle line:10%
one team is medical,
one team is legal,

00:17:16.290 --> 00:17:20.410 align:middle line:10%
and the other team is we
call it the takedown team.

00:17:20.410 --> 00:17:22.060 align:middle line:90%
We don't say much about them.

00:17:22.060 --> 00:17:23.760 align:middle line:90%
They're very hidden.

00:17:23.760 --> 00:17:29.370 align:middle line:84%
But there's about between 60
and 70 people on each team,

00:17:29.370 --> 00:17:33.030 align:middle line:90%
very, very carefully placed.

00:17:33.030 --> 00:17:36.450 align:middle line:84%
And the goal-- my
particular task

00:17:36.450 --> 00:17:40.140 align:middle line:84%
was to teach about the
mind and consciousness.

00:17:40.140 --> 00:17:44.980 align:middle line:10%
And I was told, you will
stay under the radar.

00:17:44.980 --> 00:17:47.590 align:middle line:10%
You will stay under the radar
because they'll take you out

00:17:47.590 --> 00:17:48.390 align:middle line:10%
in a minute.

00:17:48.390 --> 00:17:53.410 align:middle line:84%
Until we tell you go,
you will not be public.

00:17:53.410 --> 00:17:54.820 align:middle line:90%
You won't say much.

00:17:54.820 --> 00:17:56.690 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So when
was your go date?

00:17:56.690 --> 00:17:58.280 align:middle line:90%
>>KELLY: It was October.

00:17:58.280 --> 00:18:02.910 align:middle line:84%
I think it was October
20 or 29, 2018.

00:18:02.910 --> 00:18:03.710 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:18:03.710 --> 00:18:05.660 align:middle line:84%
>>KELLY: And actually,
you're the one who

00:18:05.660 --> 00:18:07.380 align:middle line:90%
triggered some of that crisis.

00:18:07.380 --> 00:18:09.090 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Oh, I'm sorry.

00:18:09.090 --> 00:18:11.070 align:middle line:90%
Crisis, you didn't tell me that.

00:18:11.070 --> 00:18:11.870 align:middle line:90%
What do you mean?

00:18:11.870 --> 00:18:15.660 align:middle line:84%
>>KELLY: Well, you had
invited me to be on your site,

00:18:15.660 --> 00:18:18.873 align:middle line:84%
and so we did a program,
a couple of interviews--

00:18:18.873 --> 00:18:20.040 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah, on the road.

00:18:20.040 --> 00:18:23.500 align:middle line:84%
>>KELLY: --and I was like,
should I say anything?

00:18:23.500 --> 00:18:25.650 align:middle line:90%
Should I be--

00:18:25.650 --> 00:18:27.570 align:middle line:90%
So I'm being very careful.

00:18:27.570 --> 00:18:30.560 align:middle line:84%
But that attracted
attention and I started

00:18:30.560 --> 00:18:32.820 align:middle line:90%
getting other invitations.

00:18:32.820 --> 00:18:37.890 align:middle line:84%
And then I was like, oh, no,
I haven't gotten word yet.

00:18:37.890 --> 00:18:41.120 align:middle line:10%
And so I'm stewing and
chewing and thinking

00:18:41.120 --> 00:18:43.410 align:middle line:10%
of turning down some of these.

00:18:43.410 --> 00:18:49.020 align:middle line:10%
And one of my people appeared
in my bedroom and said,

00:18:49.020 --> 00:18:50.137 align:middle line:10%
OK, go, go, go, go.

00:18:50.137 --> 00:18:50.970 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: It's time.

00:18:50.970 --> 00:18:52.020 align:middle line:90%
The cat's out of the bag.

00:18:52.020 --> 00:18:52.820 align:middle line:90%
Go for it.

00:18:52.820 --> 00:18:53.210 align:middle line:90%
>>KELLY: That's right.

00:18:53.210 --> 00:18:54.480 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: So All right.

00:18:54.480 --> 00:18:56.010 align:middle line:84%
Well, I didn't know I was
part of that initiation,

00:18:56.010 --> 00:18:57.000 align:middle line:90%
but good to know.

00:18:57.000 --> 00:18:57.833 align:middle line:90%
>>KELLY: Yeah, sure.

00:18:57.833 --> 00:19:00.230 align:middle line:10%
>>REGINA: So then you start
speaking more publicly

00:19:00.230 --> 00:19:01.030 align:middle line:10%
about this.

00:19:01.030 --> 00:19:03.780 align:middle line:10%
So let's get into what
each of these-- and it's

00:19:03.780 --> 00:19:06.520 align:middle line:10%
important to note,
there are many,

00:19:06.520 --> 00:19:08.550 align:middle line:10%
many beings that are on
this planet right now

00:19:08.550 --> 00:19:12.750 align:middle line:10%
from other dimensions and other
third dimensional places that

00:19:12.750 --> 00:19:17.940 align:middle line:10%
are here to usher through us
through this period as hands off

00:19:17.940 --> 00:19:20.400 align:middle line:10%
and sweet a way as
possible, because this

00:19:20.400 --> 00:19:22.560 align:middle line:10%
is a precious species.

00:19:22.560 --> 00:19:28.650 align:middle line:10%
Humans are so unique and complex
and precious as a template

00:19:28.650 --> 00:19:29.770 align:middle line:10%
throughout the universe.

00:19:29.770 --> 00:19:32.260 align:middle line:84%
And we can't say
that strongly enough.

00:19:32.260 --> 00:19:34.280 align:middle line:84%
So you're one of
these team members,

00:19:34.280 --> 00:19:35.530 align:middle line:90%
you're part of the media team.

00:19:35.530 --> 00:19:37.390 align:middle line:84%
But let's talk about
the other teams, too,

00:19:37.390 --> 00:19:39.930 align:middle line:84%
and what they were here
and how they suddenly

00:19:39.930 --> 00:19:41.910 align:middle line:90%
were able to work with people.

00:19:41.910 --> 00:19:44.410 align:middle line:84%
>>KELLY: There were
only a few team leaders.

00:19:44.410 --> 00:19:46.410 align:middle line:90%
I'm one of the team leaders.

00:19:46.410 --> 00:19:51.070 align:middle line:84%
Two of my other team
leaders, one has died.

00:19:51.070 --> 00:19:55.650 align:middle line:10%
He was at the UN way up there,
and he was a huge source

00:19:55.650 --> 00:19:57.550 align:middle line:10%
of information for me.

00:19:57.550 --> 00:20:02.430 align:middle line:84%
The other one is now much
older and she's not doing well,

00:20:02.430 --> 00:20:04.930 align:middle line:90%
so she's not working.

00:20:04.930 --> 00:20:08.700 align:middle line:10%
She did her task.

00:20:08.700 --> 00:20:10.920 align:middle line:10%
She lives in South America now.

00:20:10.920 --> 00:20:15.810 align:middle line:10%
But the media team,
their task was

00:20:15.810 --> 00:20:20.020 align:middle line:10%
to tell the truth about
the turning point.

00:20:20.020 --> 00:20:24.210 align:middle line:84%
The turning point was
between 2015 and 2021.

00:20:24.210 --> 00:20:30.330 align:middle line:10%
And so that the choice that
was made, a lot of people

00:20:30.330 --> 00:20:35.860 align:middle line:10%
fell for the come on to get a
particular medical procedure.

00:20:35.860 --> 00:20:39.290 align:middle line:90%
And a lot of people just--

00:20:39.290 --> 00:20:41.290 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: There was a
choice point for humanity.

00:20:41.290 --> 00:20:42.490 align:middle line:90%
>>KELLY: Yeah, that's right.

00:20:42.490 --> 00:20:46.610 align:middle line:10%
>>REGINA: But the problem
is that the same forces that

00:20:46.610 --> 00:20:51.030 align:middle line:10%
have tried to keep people
essentially quiet and compliant.

00:20:51.030 --> 00:20:52.530 align:middle line:84%
I think that's a
good way to say it.

00:20:52.530 --> 00:20:54.420 align:middle line:84%
Quiet and compliant,
don't look too far.

00:20:54.420 --> 00:20:57.580 align:middle line:84%
Don't look too far, but
your palm will do for now.

00:20:57.580 --> 00:20:58.580 align:middle line:10%
[LAUGHTER]

00:20:58.580 --> 00:21:00.210 align:middle line:10%
What's in your palm
will do for now.

00:21:00.210 --> 00:21:01.043 align:middle line:90%
>>KELLY: Right here.

00:21:01.043 --> 00:21:03.230 align:middle line:90%


00:21:03.230 --> 00:21:04.410 align:middle line:10%
>>REGINA: Misled the public.

00:21:04.410 --> 00:21:07.910 align:middle line:84%
So it was very difficult to
make intelligent decisions

00:21:07.910 --> 00:21:08.990 align:middle line:90%
at that time.

00:21:08.990 --> 00:21:13.310 align:middle line:84%
It's going to be as difficult,
if not more difficult

00:21:13.310 --> 00:21:15.650 align:middle line:84%
on the next round,
which I believe

00:21:15.650 --> 00:21:16.810 align:middle line:90%
there will be a next round.

00:21:16.810 --> 00:21:17.610 align:middle line:90%
>>KELLY: There is.

00:21:17.610 --> 00:21:18.410 align:middle line:90%
There is.

00:21:18.410 --> 00:21:21.030 align:middle line:10%
So the media team,
the task was--

00:21:21.030 --> 00:21:24.440 align:middle line:10%
well, my task was to
teach, but in the main,

00:21:24.440 --> 00:21:28.560 align:middle line:10%
their task was to keep the
issues, keep the hope alive,

00:21:28.560 --> 00:21:32.850 align:middle line:10%
keep the truth flowing
as much as possible

00:21:32.850 --> 00:21:35.930 align:middle line:10%
and give people something
to hang on to so that they

00:21:35.930 --> 00:21:38.000 align:middle line:10%
could make the
turn even if they'd

00:21:38.000 --> 00:21:40.110 align:middle line:10%
got the medical procedure.

00:21:40.110 --> 00:21:43.040 align:middle line:10%
Now, the medical
team, some of them

00:21:43.040 --> 00:21:48.150 align:middle line:10%
were to just out and out say
no, don't do this, and they did.

00:21:48.150 --> 00:21:50.790 align:middle line:84%
But some of that
medical team are

00:21:50.790 --> 00:21:56.410 align:middle line:84%
people that are scientists
that have we'll say,

00:21:56.410 --> 00:22:01.830 align:middle line:84%
new technologies that
are ready to be shared.

00:22:01.830 --> 00:22:06.780 align:middle line:10%
And so the media team is trying
to keep people's hopes up

00:22:06.780 --> 00:22:08.370 align:middle line:10%
and keep their chin up.

00:22:08.370 --> 00:22:10.830 align:middle line:10%
At the same time,
the medical people

00:22:10.830 --> 00:22:13.960 align:middle line:10%
are saying we're working on
a cure or fix or whatever,

00:22:13.960 --> 00:22:16.000 align:middle line:10%
and we already have that.

00:22:16.000 --> 00:22:20.470 align:middle line:84%
So I know what that is, but
I'm not at liberty to say.

00:22:20.470 --> 00:22:23.430 align:middle line:10%
And then the legal
team is really

00:22:23.430 --> 00:22:26.700 align:middle line:10%
immersed in like sparking
new conversations

00:22:26.700 --> 00:22:30.640 align:middle line:10%
about what kind of governance,
what kind of country,

00:22:30.640 --> 00:22:33.430 align:middle line:10%
what kind of changes,
what kind of additions,

00:22:33.430 --> 00:22:36.840 align:middle line:10%
subtractions,
multiplications, whatever

00:22:36.840 --> 00:22:41.610 align:middle line:10%
are needed in order to
refresh the country.

00:22:41.610 --> 00:22:47.140 align:middle line:84%
And then the takedown team
is taking out the corruption.

00:22:47.140 --> 00:22:50.380 align:middle line:84%
And that's very
hidden at this point.

00:22:50.380 --> 00:22:53.610 align:middle line:10%
>>REGINA: Well,
everybody has their ways.

00:22:53.610 --> 00:22:55.060 align:middle line:90%
It's not our business, really.

00:22:55.060 --> 00:22:58.860 align:middle line:10%
Just to know that there
is a grace to all of it

00:22:58.860 --> 00:23:00.960 align:middle line:10%
and that everything
takes place as it

00:23:00.960 --> 00:23:05.460 align:middle line:10%
needs to like you say
addition and subtraction of--

00:23:05.460 --> 00:23:06.280 align:middle line:10%
>>KELLY: Yeah.

00:23:06.280 --> 00:23:09.040 align:middle line:90%
So that's pretty much the teams.

00:23:09.040 --> 00:23:13.560 align:middle line:84%
Everybody has really
done a phenomenal job.

00:23:13.560 --> 00:23:18.420 align:middle line:10%
I think watching from
a distance and trying

00:23:18.420 --> 00:23:22.710 align:middle line:10%
to keep my own self from being
completely overloaded by all

00:23:22.710 --> 00:23:24.330 align:middle line:10%
the work that's involved.

00:23:24.330 --> 00:23:28.950 align:middle line:84%
It's been a process that
is incredibly rewarding.

00:23:28.950 --> 00:23:32.610 align:middle line:84%
Sometimes, it's kind
of a head scratcher.

00:23:32.610 --> 00:23:34.492 align:middle line:84%
What are we going
to do about that?

00:23:34.492 --> 00:23:35.950 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Well, to
get from A to B,

00:23:35.950 --> 00:23:38.220 align:middle line:84%
I mean, that's the thing
is how do make this leap.

00:23:38.220 --> 00:23:38.640 align:middle line:90%
>>KELLY: That's right.

00:23:38.640 --> 00:23:39.750 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: What are all
the interim steps that

00:23:39.750 --> 00:23:40.430 align:middle line:90%
will have to happen.

00:23:40.430 --> 00:23:41.230 align:middle line:90%
>>KELLY: Yeah.

00:23:41.230 --> 00:23:45.865 align:middle line:84%
And the leap is from 3D
consciousness to 4D and even 5D.

00:23:45.865 --> 00:23:47.490 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And people
need to understand

00:23:47.490 --> 00:23:49.380 align:middle line:84%
that that doesn't
mean you're living

00:23:49.380 --> 00:23:50.920 align:middle line:84%
in the fourth or
fifth dimension.

00:23:50.920 --> 00:23:53.462 align:middle line:84%
Well, in fact, we probably are
closer to the fourth dimension

00:23:53.462 --> 00:23:54.390 align:middle line:90%
now physically.

00:23:54.390 --> 00:23:56.940 align:middle line:84%
Doesn't mean we're living in
the fifth dimensional physical

00:23:56.940 --> 00:23:59.803 align:middle line:84%
energy, but our consciousness
is moving into fifth dimension--

00:23:59.803 --> 00:24:00.720 align:middle line:90%
>>KELLY: That's right.

00:24:00.720 --> 00:24:01.803 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: --consciousness.

00:24:01.803 --> 00:24:05.220 align:middle line:10%
>>KELLY: Now, most people think
of fourth and fifth dimension

00:24:05.220 --> 00:24:08.230 align:middle line:10%
as someplace else,
a different Earth.

00:24:08.230 --> 00:24:10.950 align:middle line:10%
And what I think
is really important

00:24:10.950 --> 00:24:12.900 align:middle line:10%
is for people to
understand is that you

00:24:12.900 --> 00:24:15.880 align:middle line:10%
want to be able
to address and be

00:24:15.880 --> 00:24:19.100 align:middle line:10%
comfortable in all three
dimensions third, fourth,

00:24:19.100 --> 00:24:20.020 align:middle line:10%
and fifth.

00:24:20.020 --> 00:24:22.700 align:middle line:10%
And there's a different
consciousness.

00:24:22.700 --> 00:24:27.170 align:middle line:10%
But it's not-- if I had to
describe the consciousness,

00:24:27.170 --> 00:24:31.380 align:middle line:10%
I don't have my chart in
front of me, but in the 3D,

00:24:31.380 --> 00:24:35.630 align:middle line:10%
there's ways of thinking
about, let's just use business.

00:24:35.630 --> 00:24:37.220 align:middle line:90%
It's about competition.

00:24:37.220 --> 00:24:38.020 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:24:38.020 --> 00:24:43.720 align:middle line:84%
4D is about cooperation and
5D, it's about cooperation

00:24:43.720 --> 00:24:48.500 align:middle line:84%
and healing and making
sure everything is win-win.

00:24:48.500 --> 00:24:52.930 align:middle line:84%
And so that's a whole
different way of operating.

00:24:52.930 --> 00:24:57.910 align:middle line:84%
And I have four
pages of differences

00:24:57.910 --> 00:25:01.640 align:middle line:84%
between third and fourth and
fifth dimensional consciousness.

00:25:01.640 --> 00:25:07.690 align:middle line:84%
And once you read those, most
people think, I can do that.

00:25:07.690 --> 00:25:08.687 align:middle line:90%
I can go there.

00:25:08.687 --> 00:25:10.520 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: They're already
starting to do it.

00:25:10.520 --> 00:25:13.510 align:middle line:84%
They're already starting to
reject the ways of business.

00:25:13.510 --> 00:25:17.550 align:middle line:84%
It was interesting just to show
how ugly and awful it's become.

00:25:17.550 --> 00:25:20.670 align:middle line:84%
Very recently, one
of the lone execs

00:25:20.670 --> 00:25:24.820 align:middle line:84%
in a certain division of B of
A was worked so hard, I mean,

00:25:24.820 --> 00:25:27.340 align:middle line:84%
like running a poor
horse into the ground.

00:25:27.340 --> 00:25:31.447 align:middle line:84%
He was working over 100 hours
a week and make that sale.

00:25:31.447 --> 00:25:32.530 align:middle line:90%
You got to make that sale.

00:25:32.530 --> 00:25:34.450 align:middle line:84%
Your commission is
dependent on it.

00:25:34.450 --> 00:25:37.277 align:middle line:84%
He was doing everything
to be the perfect closer

00:25:37.277 --> 00:25:38.110 align:middle line:90%
and he dropped dead.

00:25:38.110 --> 00:25:39.080 align:middle line:90%
He was in his 30s.

00:25:39.080 --> 00:25:44.870 align:middle line:84%
Dropped dead, his heart just
gave out and, this is good,

00:25:44.870 --> 00:25:48.652 align:middle line:90%
B of A said, oh my god.

00:25:48.652 --> 00:25:49.640 align:middle line:90%
Oh my god.

00:25:49.640 --> 00:25:50.360 align:middle line:90%
>>KELLY: What have we done?

00:25:50.360 --> 00:25:51.527 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: What have we done.

00:25:51.527 --> 00:25:54.110 align:middle line:84%
And so B of A had to
start backing off,

00:25:54.110 --> 00:25:56.470 align:middle line:84%
and now they're having
to read-- this is new.

00:25:56.470 --> 00:25:58.690 align:middle line:84%
Reexamine their whole
corporate culture

00:25:58.690 --> 00:26:00.920 align:middle line:84%
that you can't treat
people like that.

00:26:00.920 --> 00:26:04.060 align:middle line:90%
But he's the sacrifice.

00:26:04.060 --> 00:26:07.640 align:middle line:84%
And there are people who've
come in for just that purpose.

00:26:07.640 --> 00:26:09.100 align:middle line:90%
>>KELLY: That's exactly right.

00:26:09.100 --> 00:26:12.490 align:middle line:10%
>>REGINA: To show us just
how corrupt it's become

00:26:12.490 --> 00:26:16.140 align:middle line:10%
and how draining of the human
spirit and human battery, energy

00:26:16.140 --> 00:26:16.940 align:middle line:10%
field.

00:26:16.940 --> 00:26:18.310 align:middle line:10%
>>KELLY: I know.

00:26:18.310 --> 00:26:19.250 align:middle line:10%
I know.

00:26:19.250 --> 00:26:21.650 align:middle line:10%
We have to become new humans.

00:26:21.650 --> 00:26:24.560 align:middle line:84%
And when we do that,
it's a new consciousness.

00:26:24.560 --> 00:26:28.010 align:middle line:84%
You can't become a new human
and keep the old consciousness.

00:26:28.010 --> 00:26:29.450 align:middle line:90%
That doesn't work.

00:26:29.450 --> 00:26:31.710 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: And it's starting.

00:26:31.710 --> 00:26:32.510 align:middle line:90%
We're seeing it.

00:26:32.510 --> 00:26:34.070 align:middle line:90%
So now I want to ask you this.

00:26:34.070 --> 00:26:36.200 align:middle line:84%
OK, so we're already
starting to see it.

00:26:36.200 --> 00:26:39.320 align:middle line:10%
Even B of A is recognizing they
have to change their ways a bit.

00:26:39.320 --> 00:26:40.133 align:middle line:90%
That's big.

00:26:40.133 --> 00:26:41.050 align:middle line:90%
>>KELLY: That is huge.

00:26:41.050 --> 00:26:42.130 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: It's very
hopeful and there's

00:26:42.130 --> 00:26:43.588 align:middle line:84%
something else
going on in the news

00:26:43.588 --> 00:26:46.880 align:middle line:84%
right now that's giving some
potential for hope as well.

00:26:46.880 --> 00:26:48.900 align:middle line:90%
So let's go now.

00:26:48.900 --> 00:26:50.370 align:middle line:90%
This all takes time.

00:26:50.370 --> 00:26:52.380 align:middle line:84%
We're going to watch
chaos for a little while.

00:26:52.380 --> 00:26:53.588 align:middle line:90%
We're going to be part of it.

00:26:53.588 --> 00:26:55.820 align:middle line:10%
We're going to make our
own empowered decisions

00:26:55.820 --> 00:26:59.030 align:middle line:10%
as to how we want to show up
as healers, every one of us

00:26:59.030 --> 00:27:01.530 align:middle line:10%
in our own lives and
among our own clans.

00:27:01.530 --> 00:27:02.940 align:middle line:90%
We're all going to do that.

00:27:02.940 --> 00:27:06.590 align:middle line:84%
But what about the younger
generations being born now?

00:27:06.590 --> 00:27:09.980 align:middle line:10%
Gen Z, let's talk about
them first and then let's

00:27:09.980 --> 00:27:11.490 align:middle line:10%
go to the little alphas.

00:27:11.490 --> 00:27:13.840 align:middle line:84%
They're quite young, these
little brilliant things.

00:27:13.840 --> 00:27:18.530 align:middle line:84%
>>KELLY: [LAUGHS] OK, so one
of the things that we have

00:27:18.530 --> 00:27:24.710 align:middle line:84%
in the future with those Gen
Z people is that they really--

00:27:24.710 --> 00:27:28.070 align:middle line:84%
they have a
different vision, OK?

00:27:28.070 --> 00:27:33.320 align:middle line:84%
They are the engine
of that new world.

00:27:33.320 --> 00:27:39.240 align:middle line:84%
And I am really very excited
about what I see with them.

00:27:39.240 --> 00:27:42.180 align:middle line:84%
There's been a lot of
talk among people my age.

00:27:42.180 --> 00:27:43.410 align:middle line:90%
How do we get them involved?

00:27:43.410 --> 00:27:44.577 align:middle line:90%
I'm like, they are involved.

00:27:44.577 --> 00:27:46.535 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: They're going
to do it their own way.

00:27:46.535 --> 00:27:47.760 align:middle line:90%
>>KELLY: That's right.

00:27:47.760 --> 00:27:49.290 align:middle line:90%
That's exactly right.

00:27:49.290 --> 00:27:53.940 align:middle line:84%
And they are out there in terms
of they're out of the box.

00:27:53.940 --> 00:27:55.400 align:middle line:90%
That's what I mean by out there.

00:27:55.400 --> 00:28:01.220 align:middle line:10%
They're out of the 3D box and
that is such a free thing.

00:28:01.220 --> 00:28:03.120 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: It's wonderful.

00:28:03.120 --> 00:28:05.580 align:middle line:84%
If I can interject
something, you'll appreciate.

00:28:05.580 --> 00:28:09.470 align:middle line:84%
So I interviewed someone named
Vernon Mahabal the other day,

00:28:09.470 --> 00:28:12.120 align:middle line:84%
and he's a lifelong
Vedic astrologer,

00:28:12.120 --> 00:28:14.900 align:middle line:84%
but he also is a master
at reading the hands

00:28:14.900 --> 00:28:15.900 align:middle line:90%
and he reads hands.

00:28:15.900 --> 00:28:19.770 align:middle line:84%
He can read the changes in hands
generationally, regionally.

00:28:19.770 --> 00:28:21.530 align:middle line:84%
Their palms and
fingers are going

00:28:21.530 --> 00:28:25.110 align:middle line:84%
to be different, depending
on what they're born into.

00:28:25.110 --> 00:28:27.420 align:middle line:90%
And I asked him about the Z's.

00:28:27.420 --> 00:28:29.760 align:middle line:84%
He said, I said, what are
their characteristics?

00:28:29.760 --> 00:28:31.350 align:middle line:90%
He said, thumb.

00:28:31.350 --> 00:28:35.600 align:middle line:84%
They have very strong
will and they are here

00:28:35.600 --> 00:28:38.815 align:middle line:84%
to live by their true
ethics and character.

00:28:38.815 --> 00:28:39.960 align:middle line:90%
>>KELLY: Oh, love it.

00:28:39.960 --> 00:28:42.920 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And high character is
the hallmark of that generation.

00:28:42.920 --> 00:28:45.937 align:middle line:84%
But that as each
generation goes along,

00:28:45.937 --> 00:28:48.020 align:middle line:84%
it's waking up a little
slower because we're going

00:28:48.020 --> 00:28:49.103 align:middle line:90%
to be living longer lives.

00:28:49.103 --> 00:28:50.150 align:middle line:90%
So it's appropriate.

00:28:50.150 --> 00:28:52.740 align:middle line:84%
If you're going to live to be
100 and 120, waking up at 40

00:28:52.740 --> 00:28:53.870 align:middle line:90%
is not so bad when.

00:28:53.870 --> 00:28:56.005 align:middle line:84%
You live to be 40,
waking up 17 worked.

00:28:56.005 --> 00:28:57.350 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHTER]

00:28:57.350 --> 00:29:00.230 align:middle line:84%
And he said, this generation
is going to be waking--

00:29:00.230 --> 00:29:04.460 align:middle line:84%
really waking up individually in
their 40s is when they come full

00:29:04.460 --> 00:29:06.540 align:middle line:84%
circle with everything
they've experienced.

00:29:06.540 --> 00:29:08.670 align:middle line:90%
So what is your thought on that?

00:29:08.670 --> 00:29:11.670 align:middle line:10%
>>KELLY: I think that, like
I said, they're the engine,

00:29:11.670 --> 00:29:14.000 align:middle line:10%
they're the creative juice.

00:29:14.000 --> 00:29:19.316 align:middle line:84%
And what I've seen is that
they have this, I don't know.

00:29:19.316 --> 00:29:21.740 align:middle line:84%
If my grandmother
were here, she would

00:29:21.740 --> 00:29:23.890 align:middle line:90%
say that they're very willful.

00:29:23.890 --> 00:29:25.140 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: That's what he said.

00:29:25.140 --> 00:29:26.730 align:middle line:90%
They have a strong will.

00:29:26.730 --> 00:29:27.580 align:middle line:90%
>>KELLY: OK.

00:29:27.580 --> 00:29:28.380 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:29:28.380 --> 00:29:30.830 align:middle line:84%
They haven't seen
some of the hard times

00:29:30.830 --> 00:29:33.140 align:middle line:84%
that people in my
generation have seen

00:29:33.140 --> 00:29:37.320 align:middle line:84%
and they don't want
to create hard times.

00:29:37.320 --> 00:29:39.290 align:middle line:90%
They don't create hard times.

00:29:39.290 --> 00:29:41.970 align:middle line:84%
That's what I see when
they're moving forward.

00:29:41.970 --> 00:29:45.080 align:middle line:84%
And I think that's because
they're living, I call it,

00:29:45.080 --> 00:29:46.420 align:middle line:90%
according to their heart.

00:29:46.420 --> 00:29:47.220 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Ethics.

00:29:47.220 --> 00:29:48.300 align:middle line:90%
True character.

00:29:48.300 --> 00:29:49.100 align:middle line:90%
>>KELLY: Yes.

00:29:49.100 --> 00:29:51.020 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Yeah,
that's sounds like you

00:29:51.020 --> 00:29:53.030 align:middle line:84%
and Vernon have a
really wonderful overlay

00:29:53.030 --> 00:29:54.030 align:middle line:90%
in your vision.

00:29:54.030 --> 00:29:57.210 align:middle line:84%
>>KELLY: I tell you what, if
you don't follow your heart,

00:29:57.210 --> 00:29:59.540 align:middle line:84%
you can't have a
relationship with source.

00:29:59.540 --> 00:30:01.260 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right Very true.

00:30:01.260 --> 00:30:07.290 align:middle line:84%
>>KELLY: That is something
that they've got in spades.

00:30:07.290 --> 00:30:09.750 align:middle line:10%
They may not use
that same language,

00:30:09.750 --> 00:30:13.960 align:middle line:10%
but they're working
in a way that is--

00:30:13.960 --> 00:30:17.720 align:middle line:10%
I'm like, where did
you get that idea?

00:30:17.720 --> 00:30:22.040 align:middle line:84%
And they saw it in some goofy
game, a video game, a movie,

00:30:22.040 --> 00:30:23.180 align:middle line:90%
a song.

00:30:23.180 --> 00:30:27.860 align:middle line:84%
And I'm looking at all that
and thinking all that stuff

00:30:27.860 --> 00:30:31.530 align:middle line:84%
that we've had, the
games, the music,

00:30:31.530 --> 00:30:34.320 align:middle line:90%
the changes along those lines.

00:30:34.320 --> 00:30:36.800 align:middle line:84%
They've taken that
and run with it.

00:30:36.800 --> 00:30:41.660 align:middle line:10%
All the permissions embedded in
those people in my generation

00:30:41.660 --> 00:30:43.480 align:middle line:10%
are like, well.

00:30:43.480 --> 00:30:44.280 align:middle line:10%
>>REGINA: Oh, yeah.

00:30:44.280 --> 00:30:45.875 align:middle line:10%
I mean, this is for
their generation.

00:30:45.875 --> 00:30:46.750 align:middle line:10%
>>KELLY: Yeah, it is.

00:30:46.750 --> 00:30:48.980 align:middle line:10%
>>REGINA: A generation came
to do what we came to do.

00:30:48.980 --> 00:30:50.520 align:middle line:10%
Their generation came for that.

00:30:50.520 --> 00:30:53.490 align:middle line:10%
And it was funny, after
I had interviewed Vernon,

00:30:53.490 --> 00:30:55.895 align:middle line:10%
went into the cafeteria,
had some lunch, and one

00:30:55.895 --> 00:30:58.020 align:middle line:10%
of the lovely men that
works in the cafeteria said,

00:30:58.020 --> 00:30:58.880 align:middle line:10%
hey, how's it going?

00:30:58.880 --> 00:30:59.855 align:middle line:90%
How was your show?

00:30:59.855 --> 00:31:00.730 align:middle line:90%
I said, it was great.

00:31:00.730 --> 00:31:02.690 align:middle line:84%
He was just talking
about Gen Z's and what

00:31:02.690 --> 00:31:04.333 align:middle line:84%
a strong, beautiful
character they have

00:31:04.333 --> 00:31:06.250 align:middle line:84%
that they're going to
have character backbone.

00:31:06.250 --> 00:31:09.070 align:middle line:84%
He goes, oh, my God, let me
tell you about my Gen Z brother.

00:31:09.070 --> 00:31:11.540 align:middle line:84%
He said, you can't
shake him from what

00:31:11.540 --> 00:31:13.110 align:middle line:90%
he believes to be right.

00:31:13.110 --> 00:31:14.250 align:middle line:90%
You just can't shake him.

00:31:14.250 --> 00:31:15.780 align:middle line:90%
He has such strong character.

00:31:15.780 --> 00:31:16.825 align:middle line:90%
>>KELLY: I love that.

00:31:16.825 --> 00:31:20.090 align:middle line:10%
>>REGINA: And so that's what
we need because we've kind of--

00:31:20.090 --> 00:31:24.140 align:middle line:10%
we've drifted into field of
being exposed to so many ideas

00:31:24.140 --> 00:31:29.700 align:middle line:10%
and concepts through the media,
through our educational system,

00:31:29.700 --> 00:31:31.960 align:middle line:10%
but just through life,
through entertainment.

00:31:31.960 --> 00:31:35.540 align:middle line:84%
The open minded people
will check out everything.

00:31:35.540 --> 00:31:36.510 align:middle line:90%
>>KELLY: They do.

00:31:36.510 --> 00:31:37.320 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: We do.

00:31:37.320 --> 00:31:38.570 align:middle line:90%
I mean, that's what humans do.

00:31:38.570 --> 00:31:40.593 align:middle line:84%
>>KELLY: And they
borrow and they copy.

00:31:40.593 --> 00:31:43.010 align:middle line:10%
>>REGINA: You do that until
you get yourself into a corner

00:31:43.010 --> 00:31:45.620 align:middle line:10%
where you say, oh, this
doesn't feel good anymore.

00:31:45.620 --> 00:31:48.110 align:middle line:10%
And then you have to swing
back to something that's

00:31:48.110 --> 00:31:52.740 align:middle line:10%
a little more, has a plumb line
that might be a little more,

00:31:52.740 --> 00:31:55.710 align:middle line:10%
as you say, will
centered and moralistic,

00:31:55.710 --> 00:31:57.120 align:middle line:10%
but not in a judgy way.

00:31:57.120 --> 00:31:59.730 align:middle line:84%
Just clearly like you
got to do what's right.

00:31:59.730 --> 00:32:02.120 align:middle line:84%
>>KELLY: Another thing
about that generation

00:32:02.120 --> 00:32:04.250 align:middle line:90%
is their sense of humor.

00:32:04.250 --> 00:32:07.350 align:middle line:10%
They have this amazing
sense of humor.

00:32:07.350 --> 00:32:11.570 align:middle line:84%
It's a little on the goofy
side, but it really carries--

00:32:11.570 --> 00:32:14.045 align:middle line:84%
You have to have
a sense of humor

00:32:14.045 --> 00:32:15.670 align:middle line:84%
in order to have
spiritual development.

00:32:15.670 --> 00:32:16.315 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Hm-mm.

00:32:16.315 --> 00:32:17.115 align:middle line:10%
Absolutely.

00:32:17.115 --> 00:32:20.120 align:middle line:84%
>>KELLY: Otherwise, you won't
have any tolerance or patience

00:32:20.120 --> 00:32:21.177 align:middle line:90%
or any of that.

00:32:21.177 --> 00:32:23.510 align:middle line:10%
>>REGINA: No, just be sitting
in judgment of everything.

00:32:23.510 --> 00:32:27.920 align:middle line:84%
I've had those days where, for
whatever reason, just no energy.

00:32:27.920 --> 00:32:31.340 align:middle line:84%
A down mood and it's like,
I am so judgy those days,

00:32:31.340 --> 00:32:32.670 align:middle line:90%
and I'm so embarrassed.

00:32:32.670 --> 00:32:33.770 align:middle line:90%
I'm like, sorry.

00:32:33.770 --> 00:32:36.490 align:middle line:10%
Sorry, person I just had
that negative thought about.

00:32:36.490 --> 00:32:37.600 align:middle line:10%
I'm the jerk.

00:32:37.600 --> 00:32:38.400 align:middle line:90%
I get it.

00:32:38.400 --> 00:32:39.500 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHTER]

00:32:39.500 --> 00:32:41.240 align:middle line:84%
>>KELLY: Let me
erase that quickly.

00:32:41.240 --> 00:32:42.380 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah, erase.

00:32:42.380 --> 00:32:44.030 align:middle line:84%
I mean, we all do
it, especially when

00:32:44.030 --> 00:32:45.690 align:middle line:90%
our energy has been depleted.

00:32:45.690 --> 00:32:49.160 align:middle line:84%
So in our energy at mass has
been depleted intentionally.

00:32:49.160 --> 00:32:50.330 align:middle line:90%
>>KELLY: It has.

00:32:50.330 --> 00:32:51.180 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:32:51.180 --> 00:32:53.100 align:middle line:84%
If there's one thing
that I could change,

00:32:53.100 --> 00:32:56.490 align:middle line:84%
it would be the health
of the population.

00:32:56.490 --> 00:32:58.650 align:middle line:84%
When I became a
naturopathic physician,

00:32:58.650 --> 00:33:01.590 align:middle line:90%
this was back in when I was 46.

00:33:01.590 --> 00:33:03.627 align:middle line:90%
That's a long time ago.

00:33:03.627 --> 00:33:09.800 align:middle line:84%
I really was just studying
that because I had developed

00:33:09.800 --> 00:33:10.991 align:middle line:90%
a rheumatoid arthritis.

00:33:10.991 --> 00:33:12.314 align:middle line:90%
Severe rheumatoid arthritis.

00:33:12.314 --> 00:33:13.640 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: When you were young.

00:33:13.640 --> 00:33:17.550 align:middle line:10%
>>KELLY: Yeah, I was 46 and I
couldn't walk, I couldn't move,

00:33:17.550 --> 00:33:20.250 align:middle line:10%
I couldn't open anything.

00:33:20.250 --> 00:33:24.940 align:middle line:84%
And so, after trying all
the new age platitudes,

00:33:24.940 --> 00:33:29.010 align:middle line:84%
I thought, OK, I need something
with some meat behind it

00:33:29.010 --> 00:33:30.690 align:middle line:90%
or some meat on the bones.

00:33:30.690 --> 00:33:36.520 align:middle line:84%
And what became so obvious
as I became healthier,

00:33:36.520 --> 00:33:39.450 align:middle line:90%
my entire consciousness changed.

00:33:39.450 --> 00:33:45.270 align:middle line:84%
And I thought it was already
out of the box, et cetera.

00:33:45.270 --> 00:33:50.070 align:middle line:84%
But at that point, that was
when all of the consciousness

00:33:50.070 --> 00:33:55.590 align:middle line:84%
came together, integrated, and
I stopped fighting Kundalini.

00:33:55.590 --> 00:33:59.100 align:middle line:84%
I started saying, what
can I do with this?

00:33:59.100 --> 00:34:01.870 align:middle line:10%
And really started
experimenting,

00:34:01.870 --> 00:34:03.700 align:middle line:10%
exploring, researching.

00:34:03.700 --> 00:34:07.560 align:middle line:84%
It's when my work as a
researcher into consciousness

00:34:07.560 --> 00:34:09.130 align:middle line:90%
really started.

00:34:09.130 --> 00:34:14.469 align:middle line:84%
But that health issue,
that is a big thing.

00:34:14.469 --> 00:34:16.960 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So such a large
percentage of humans

00:34:16.960 --> 00:34:19.840 align:middle line:84%
are walking around
feeling depleted and less

00:34:19.840 --> 00:34:21.478 align:middle line:90%
than their ideal selves.

00:34:21.478 --> 00:34:23.270 align:middle line:84%
They don't know what
their ideal selves is.

00:34:23.270 --> 00:34:24.642 align:middle line:90%
>>KELLY: I know.

00:34:24.642 --> 00:34:27.260 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: We're so used
to living with fatigue,

00:34:27.260 --> 00:34:29.530 align:middle line:84%
discomfort, pain,
and all of that

00:34:29.530 --> 00:34:32.500 align:middle line:84%
keeps us from the
brilliance of our being,

00:34:32.500 --> 00:34:34.790 align:middle line:84%
from connecting with the
brilliance of our being.

00:34:34.790 --> 00:34:35.900 align:middle line:90%
>>KELLY: I know.

00:34:35.900 --> 00:34:37.780 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So, yes,
getting free and out

00:34:37.780 --> 00:34:40.750 align:middle line:84%
of pain and having systems
that flow and work together.

00:34:40.750 --> 00:34:42.280 align:middle line:10%
Now, when you went
into the future

00:34:42.280 --> 00:34:45.760 align:middle line:10%
and were shown the future,
it was a more robust

00:34:45.760 --> 00:34:47.449 align:middle line:10%
physical profile of humans.

00:34:47.449 --> 00:34:50.270 align:middle line:84%
It was beautiful and the
technologies were beautiful.

00:34:50.270 --> 00:34:52.570 align:middle line:10%
And one of the things
is we definitely

00:34:52.570 --> 00:34:55.540 align:middle line:10%
start living closer
to nature in the land

00:34:55.540 --> 00:34:57.530 align:middle line:10%
and the offerings
of the land again.

00:34:57.530 --> 00:34:58.330 align:middle line:10%
>>KELLY: Yeah.

00:34:58.330 --> 00:35:03.880 align:middle line:10%
What happens after this period
of chaos is that people regroup.

00:35:03.880 --> 00:35:08.500 align:middle line:10%
And they group into what I'm
going to call communities

00:35:08.500 --> 00:35:09.710 align:middle line:10%
or families.

00:35:09.710 --> 00:35:12.240 align:middle line:10%
They were called
family businesses,

00:35:12.240 --> 00:35:15.210 align:middle line:10%
but they were so vibrant.

00:35:15.210 --> 00:35:17.180 align:middle line:90%
They lived close to the land.

00:35:17.180 --> 00:35:19.080 align:middle line:90%
Education was done at home.

00:35:19.080 --> 00:35:22.080 align:middle line:84%
All the children were
kept in the family.

00:35:22.080 --> 00:35:23.600 align:middle line:90%
There were no schools.

00:35:23.600 --> 00:35:26.220 align:middle line:84%
So there was nowhere
to send your children.

00:35:26.220 --> 00:35:31.250 align:middle line:84%
The issue was that people
were very, very focused

00:35:31.250 --> 00:35:34.470 align:middle line:90%
on absolute vibrant health.

00:35:34.470 --> 00:35:37.992 align:middle line:84%
The houses-- I went into
the houses of the future.

00:35:37.992 --> 00:35:40.200 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Tell us about the
houses and the bathrooms.

00:35:40.200 --> 00:35:41.160 align:middle line:90%
>>KELLY: Oh, the baths.

00:35:41.160 --> 00:35:41.960 align:middle line:90%
Oh, yes.

00:35:41.960 --> 00:35:43.700 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: I love that part.

00:35:43.700 --> 00:35:46.217 align:middle line:84%
>>KELLY: The houses were
like these dome things.

00:35:46.217 --> 00:35:47.550 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: That's what I've seen.

00:35:47.550 --> 00:35:50.310 align:middle line:10%
>>KELLY: And they were
absolutely carefree,

00:35:50.310 --> 00:35:52.213 align:middle line:10%
maintenance free.

00:35:52.213 --> 00:35:53.130 align:middle line:10%
>>REGINA: Free energy.

00:35:53.130 --> 00:35:54.020 align:middle line:10%
>>KELLY: Yeah.

00:35:54.020 --> 00:35:56.145 align:middle line:10%
They didn't have wires.

00:35:56.145 --> 00:35:57.020 align:middle line:10%
They were operating--

00:35:57.020 --> 00:35:57.853 align:middle line:10%
>>REGINA: By energy.

00:35:57.853 --> 00:35:59.720 align:middle line:10%
>>KELLY: Yeah, by frequency.

00:35:59.720 --> 00:36:01.740 align:middle line:10%
So we walked into this one.

00:36:01.740 --> 00:36:05.810 align:middle line:10%
The robes took me into a couple
of homes, and we walked in

00:36:05.810 --> 00:36:09.890 align:middle line:10%
and it struck me as this
feels like a hotel lobby, not

00:36:09.890 --> 00:36:11.100 align:middle line:10%
somebody's house.

00:36:11.100 --> 00:36:13.750 align:middle line:10%
But there were all these
hallways that went off

00:36:13.750 --> 00:36:18.800 align:middle line:10%
from the main dome, and these
hallways went to various suites,

00:36:18.800 --> 00:36:20.140 align:middle line:10%
maybe, I'll call it.

00:36:20.140 --> 00:36:23.650 align:middle line:10%
And the individual had
a bedroom and a bathroom

00:36:23.650 --> 00:36:25.010 align:middle line:10%
called a healing room.

00:36:25.010 --> 00:36:29.530 align:middle line:84%
And like a study, which
was kind of meditation,

00:36:29.530 --> 00:36:31.990 align:middle line:84%
some people called it
their evolution room

00:36:31.990 --> 00:36:36.100 align:middle line:84%
because they put some equipment
on and changed their frequency.

00:36:36.100 --> 00:36:37.970 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: The healing
room, the bathroom.

00:36:37.970 --> 00:36:39.160 align:middle line:90%
>>KELLY: The bathroom.

00:36:39.160 --> 00:36:41.050 align:middle line:90%
So we went into the bathroom.

00:36:41.050 --> 00:36:45.288 align:middle line:84%
I'll skip the huge greenhouse
that was attached to this lobby.

00:36:45.288 --> 00:36:47.830 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Yes, because we're
integrated with nature and herbs

00:36:47.830 --> 00:36:48.280 align:middle line:90%
and the things that we need.

00:36:48.280 --> 00:36:49.850 align:middle line:84%
>>KELLY: Everybody was
growing their own food.

00:36:49.850 --> 00:36:50.750 align:middle line:90%
Indoors.

00:36:50.750 --> 00:36:51.400 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Exactly.

00:36:51.400 --> 00:36:52.200 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:36:52.200 --> 00:36:54.100 align:middle line:10%
>>KELLY: So we went
into the bathroom

00:36:54.100 --> 00:37:01.160 align:middle line:10%
and the bathroom had
this like a natural pool,

00:37:01.160 --> 00:37:05.740 align:middle line:10%
like a waterfall of water
going into this rock pool.

00:37:05.740 --> 00:37:08.260 align:middle line:10%
And the water was--

00:37:08.260 --> 00:37:11.430 align:middle line:10%
you could tell that the
water was not ordinary water.

00:37:11.430 --> 00:37:13.260 align:middle line:84%
There was something,
you could smell it.

00:37:13.260 --> 00:37:16.630 align:middle line:90%
It smelled fabulous, OK?

00:37:16.630 --> 00:37:21.250 align:middle line:84%
The pool was big enough for
like 2, 3, 4 people to get in

00:37:21.250 --> 00:37:24.160 align:middle line:84%
and just sit and relax,
kind of like a hot tub.

00:37:24.160 --> 00:37:28.720 align:middle line:84%
But it looked like it was made
out of rock natural formation.

00:37:28.720 --> 00:37:30.580 align:middle line:10%
There was a mirror on the wall.

00:37:30.580 --> 00:37:32.870 align:middle line:10%
There was a huge
circular mirror.

00:37:32.870 --> 00:37:35.860 align:middle line:10%
And you would stand in this
one spot in front of the mirror

00:37:35.860 --> 00:37:38.470 align:middle line:10%
and it would light
up your energy field.

00:37:38.470 --> 00:37:40.400 align:middle line:90%
And you would see your aura.

00:37:40.400 --> 00:37:42.820 align:middle line:84%
And you could-- people
have been taught

00:37:42.820 --> 00:37:47.770 align:middle line:84%
how to diagnose what was
coming to their physical self

00:37:47.770 --> 00:37:50.060 align:middle line:90%
by looking at their lights.

00:37:50.060 --> 00:37:54.070 align:middle line:10%
And so if there was a
dark spot or a place

00:37:54.070 --> 00:37:58.370 align:middle line:10%
where your lights were not
flashing and sparkling--

00:37:58.370 --> 00:38:00.330 align:middle line:10%
>>REGINA: Where the
etheric field was dull.

00:38:00.330 --> 00:38:01.290 align:middle line:90%
>>KELLY: Right.

00:38:01.290 --> 00:38:04.590 align:middle line:84%
Or it was off color, it
would be like, what is that?

00:38:04.590 --> 00:38:07.130 align:middle line:84%
And then if there
was a place where

00:38:07.130 --> 00:38:09.650 align:middle line:84%
you had a gusher
where you were losing

00:38:09.650 --> 00:38:12.830 align:middle line:84%
just a huge amount of
energy, it'd be like, uh-oh,

00:38:12.830 --> 00:38:14.610 align:middle line:90%
there's a problem there.

00:38:14.610 --> 00:38:16.530 align:middle line:90%
There was a massage table.

00:38:16.530 --> 00:38:19.890 align:middle line:84%
It looked like a massage table
in the middle of the room.

00:38:19.890 --> 00:38:21.890 align:middle line:10%
And you would have
somebody come in

00:38:21.890 --> 00:38:25.770 align:middle line:10%
and work on you after you
had soaked in this tub.

00:38:25.770 --> 00:38:28.070 align:middle line:84%
There were places
that you could stand

00:38:28.070 --> 00:38:32.400 align:middle line:84%
and lights would shine on
you that would correct stuff.

00:38:32.400 --> 00:38:33.500 align:middle line:90%
It was just an amazing.

00:38:33.500 --> 00:38:34.790 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Using all
vibrational therapies

00:38:34.790 --> 00:38:35.590 align:middle line:90%
>>KELLY: Yeah.

00:38:35.590 --> 00:38:38.240 align:middle line:10%
And if you were really sick,
you went into the healing room

00:38:38.240 --> 00:38:43.020 align:middle line:10%
in the main portion of the
community and you had this--

00:38:43.020 --> 00:38:46.670 align:middle line:10%
it was probably the size of
this table, this template that

00:38:46.670 --> 00:38:49.430 align:middle line:10%
had all of your
frequencies mapped on it

00:38:49.430 --> 00:38:53.840 align:middle line:10%
and where your frequency
points, acupressure points

00:38:53.840 --> 00:38:55.590 align:middle line:10%
were or acupuncture points.

00:38:55.590 --> 00:38:57.980 align:middle line:10%
And this would
be-- this template

00:38:57.980 --> 00:39:01.410 align:middle line:10%
would be slid into this table
and you would lay on the table.

00:39:01.410 --> 00:39:03.170 align:middle line:84%
And this other thing
would come down

00:39:03.170 --> 00:39:04.730 align:middle line:90%
and there'd be another template.

00:39:04.730 --> 00:39:08.070 align:middle line:84%
And the two
templates would talk.

00:39:08.070 --> 00:39:10.550 align:middle line:84%
They would send a
frequency right through you

00:39:10.550 --> 00:39:13.160 align:middle line:84%
and it would correct
whatever was supposed

00:39:13.160 --> 00:39:15.810 align:middle line:90%
to happen with that frequency.

00:39:15.810 --> 00:39:18.000 align:middle line:10%
So it was amazing.

00:39:18.000 --> 00:39:18.980 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: I loved that.

00:39:18.980 --> 00:39:20.950 align:middle line:84%
I mean, that's
when I first called

00:39:20.950 --> 00:39:23.380 align:middle line:84%
you to talk with
me on my show, it

00:39:23.380 --> 00:39:25.485 align:middle line:84%
was because of-- it was
actually that bathroom.

00:39:25.485 --> 00:39:25.910 align:middle line:90%
>>KELLY: Bathroom.

00:39:25.910 --> 00:39:26.260 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHTER]

00:39:26.260 --> 00:39:27.802 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: No, I love
the whole story,

00:39:27.802 --> 00:39:29.510 align:middle line:84%
but I thought the
bathroom was so cool.

00:39:29.510 --> 00:39:29.860 align:middle line:90%
>>KELLY: It was.

00:39:29.860 --> 00:39:31.985 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: The fact that we
get developed to a point

00:39:31.985 --> 00:39:34.480 align:middle line:84%
and technology works
with us to reflect back

00:39:34.480 --> 00:39:37.250 align:middle line:84%
through our mind, what's
going on in the aura?

00:39:37.250 --> 00:39:39.280 align:middle line:84%
What's going on in
the etheric body

00:39:39.280 --> 00:39:41.740 align:middle line:84%
so that we can actually see
when we're out of balance

00:39:41.740 --> 00:39:43.870 align:middle line:84%
and nip it in the
bud before it ever

00:39:43.870 --> 00:39:46.750 align:middle line:84%
becomes manifest into our
physical emotional world?

00:39:46.750 --> 00:39:48.030 align:middle line:10%
I thought it was beautiful.

00:39:48.030 --> 00:39:48.830 align:middle line:90%
>>KELLY: It is.

00:39:48.830 --> 00:39:51.070 align:middle line:84%
It's really important,
I think, for people

00:39:51.070 --> 00:39:54.245 align:middle line:84%
to know that chemistry
follows frequency.

00:39:54.245 --> 00:39:55.120 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Absolutely.

00:39:55.120 --> 00:39:59.420 align:middle line:84%
>>KELLY: So if you don't have
the energy, the frequencies,

00:39:59.420 --> 00:40:01.150 align:middle line:84%
the chemistry isn't
going to happen

00:40:01.150 --> 00:40:03.220 align:middle line:84%
and the proteins aren't
going to form correctly,

00:40:03.220 --> 00:40:05.440 align:middle line:84%
and the interactions
aren't going to take place

00:40:05.440 --> 00:40:07.407 align:middle line:90%
and bad stuff happens.

00:40:07.407 --> 00:40:09.490 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And it also shows
us that because you're

00:40:09.490 --> 00:40:14.260 align:middle line:84%
working with energy matrices,
how quickly change can happen.

00:40:14.260 --> 00:40:16.850 align:middle line:84%
It can happen almost at
the speed of thought,

00:40:16.850 --> 00:40:17.935 align:middle line:90%
almost instantly.

00:40:17.935 --> 00:40:18.810 align:middle line:90%
>>KELLY: That's true.

00:40:18.810 --> 00:40:20.400 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And
there are examples,

00:40:20.400 --> 00:40:21.650 align:middle line:90%
I'll give you one crazy one.

00:40:21.650 --> 00:40:24.980 align:middle line:84%
Joseph Selby's book talks
about this particular woman

00:40:24.980 --> 00:40:28.680 align:middle line:84%
who was being studied on
a lot of different levels,

00:40:28.680 --> 00:40:30.060 align:middle line:90%
including drawing blood.

00:40:30.060 --> 00:40:32.160 align:middle line:10%
She was schizoid-- multiple
personality disorder.

00:40:32.160 --> 00:40:32.960 align:middle line:10%
>>KELLY: Oh, wow.

00:40:32.960 --> 00:40:34.350 align:middle line:10%
>>REGINA: 10 personalities.

00:40:34.350 --> 00:40:38.420 align:middle line:84%
And this team of
doctors studied her.

00:40:38.420 --> 00:40:40.735 align:middle line:84%
As each personality
came forward--

00:40:40.735 --> 00:40:42.060 align:middle line:90%
>>KELLY: Oh, yes.

00:40:42.060 --> 00:40:43.860 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: --her eye
color would change.

00:40:43.860 --> 00:40:45.290 align:middle line:90%
Moles would grow.

00:40:45.290 --> 00:40:47.670 align:middle line:10%
The next person that came
in, they would disappear.

00:40:47.670 --> 00:40:50.390 align:middle line:84%
Her body literally
changed with the presence

00:40:50.390 --> 00:40:55.130 align:middle line:84%
of each personality, showing
us that we can change almost

00:40:55.130 --> 00:40:56.300 align:middle line:90%
at the speed of thought.

00:40:56.300 --> 00:40:58.500 align:middle line:90%
That's our true inheritance.

00:40:58.500 --> 00:41:00.680 align:middle line:90%
We just don't believe in it yet.

00:41:00.680 --> 00:41:05.030 align:middle line:10%
>>KELLY: I think you have to
see it in order to really--

00:41:05.030 --> 00:41:07.190 align:middle line:10%
when there's somebody
has cancer and they

00:41:07.190 --> 00:41:09.780 align:middle line:10%
have spontaneous remission,
that's what they've done.

00:41:09.780 --> 00:41:11.600 align:middle line:10%
They've changed bodies.

00:41:11.600 --> 00:41:13.750 align:middle line:10%
It's just somewhere
in the night--

00:41:13.750 --> 00:41:16.535 align:middle line:10%
>>REGINA: Their imprint
just changed and manifests

00:41:16.535 --> 00:41:17.335 align:middle line:10%
into the physical.

00:41:17.335 --> 00:41:18.135 align:middle line:90%
>>KELLY: Right.

00:41:18.135 --> 00:41:19.590 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: So that is our future.

00:41:19.590 --> 00:41:20.390 align:middle line:90%
>>KELLY: Yes.

00:41:20.390 --> 00:41:21.690 align:middle line:90%
We are multidimensional.

00:41:21.690 --> 00:41:21.980 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:41:21.980 --> 00:41:23.910 align:middle line:84%
>>KELLY: We have to get
comfortable with that.

00:41:23.910 --> 00:41:24.320 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:41:24.320 --> 00:41:25.140 align:middle line:90%
>>KELLY: Yeah.

00:41:25.140 --> 00:41:25.940 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:41:25.940 --> 00:41:28.530 align:middle line:84%
And I was so intrigued
with all of that.

00:41:28.530 --> 00:41:33.530 align:middle line:10%
And way back when in the '80s,
you were seeing that these

00:41:33.530 --> 00:41:36.880 align:middle line:10%
collectives of people that
you talked about earlier were

00:41:36.880 --> 00:41:37.680 align:middle line:10%
doing--

00:41:37.680 --> 00:41:39.305 align:middle line:10%
where they were
creating their products

00:41:39.305 --> 00:41:42.350 align:middle line:10%
and they were using
some form of--

00:41:42.350 --> 00:41:44.820 align:middle line:10%
did you call it a network.

00:41:44.820 --> 00:41:46.982 align:middle line:84%
And they were interfacing
with this network where

00:41:46.982 --> 00:41:49.190 align:middle line:84%
they could communicate with
people all over the world

00:41:49.190 --> 00:41:52.760 align:middle line:84%
and buy and sell goods between
each other on this network

00:41:52.760 --> 00:41:55.590 align:middle line:90%
directly, got Amazon now.

00:41:55.590 --> 00:41:57.520 align:middle line:10%
See, you brought
that into existence.

00:41:57.520 --> 00:41:58.320 align:middle line:90%
>>KELLY: I know.

00:41:58.320 --> 00:42:01.670 align:middle line:84%
I have to say, yeah, the little
man of brown robes kept talking

00:42:01.670 --> 00:42:02.718 align:middle line:90%
about the global network.

00:42:02.718 --> 00:42:04.010 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Global network, yeah.

00:42:04.010 --> 00:42:05.803 align:middle line:90%
>>KELLY: And I'm like, OK.

00:42:05.803 --> 00:42:06.720 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: What's that?

00:42:06.720 --> 00:42:07.650 align:middle line:90%
>>KELLY: Yeah, right.

00:42:07.650 --> 00:42:10.550 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Well, now we see it
and most of us interface with it

00:42:10.550 --> 00:42:14.510 align:middle line:84%
and it has a name and there
are others that have names.

00:42:14.510 --> 00:42:16.340 align:middle line:84%
So over time, though,
the main thing

00:42:16.340 --> 00:42:19.760 align:middle line:84%
is you saw that the
way people lived

00:42:19.760 --> 00:42:24.980 align:middle line:84%
was in familial and
extended community

00:42:24.980 --> 00:42:28.010 align:middle line:84%
where there was integrity,
closeness with the land, care

00:42:28.010 --> 00:42:32.620 align:middle line:84%
for one another, bringing our
children up closely close to us,

00:42:32.620 --> 00:42:33.420 align:middle line:90%
and so forth.

00:42:33.420 --> 00:42:35.070 align:middle line:84%
>>KELLY: Let me
mention another thing.

00:42:35.070 --> 00:42:39.960 align:middle line:84%
The people in that who make
it into that new world,

00:42:39.960 --> 00:42:43.860 align:middle line:84%
their main focus was on
developing themselves.

00:42:43.860 --> 00:42:47.690 align:middle line:10%
They were amazingly intuitive.

00:42:47.690 --> 00:42:51.890 align:middle line:10%
Even the little kids
had the language.

00:42:51.890 --> 00:42:55.170 align:middle line:84%
They had the attitude,
they had the expectations,

00:42:55.170 --> 00:42:57.060 align:middle line:90%
they had the assumptions.

00:42:57.060 --> 00:42:59.790 align:middle line:90%
We don't have much of that.

00:42:59.790 --> 00:43:04.110 align:middle line:10%
I mean, you and the people
you hang with, I'm sure do.

00:43:04.110 --> 00:43:07.400 align:middle line:10%
But the children
of the future, they

00:43:07.400 --> 00:43:09.410 align:middle line:10%
have it right there
all the things

00:43:09.410 --> 00:43:11.540 align:middle line:10%
that we have struggled for.

00:43:11.540 --> 00:43:14.443 align:middle line:84%
And I'm like, yes, yes, that's
what we want to pass on.

00:43:14.443 --> 00:43:15.860 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: That's
where we're going

00:43:15.860 --> 00:43:17.565 align:middle line:84%
and that's what we'll
incarnate back to.

00:43:17.565 --> 00:43:18.365 align:middle line:90%
>>KELLY: Yeah.

00:43:18.365 --> 00:43:20.032 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And when
it's our turn to come

00:43:20.032 --> 00:43:22.850 align:middle line:84%
in as the we ones, again,
this will already be laid out.

00:43:22.850 --> 00:43:25.590 align:middle line:84%
So we know we're setting
up our own inheritance.

00:43:25.590 --> 00:43:27.860 align:middle line:84%
Not just our kids,
our own inheritance.

00:43:27.860 --> 00:43:30.375 align:middle line:84%
>>KELLY: Oh, the world has
brought that up at a point

00:43:30.375 --> 00:43:32.000 align:middle line:84%
when I didn't believe
in reincarnation.

00:43:32.000 --> 00:43:33.110 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Oh, yeah.

00:43:33.110 --> 00:43:34.810 align:middle line:90%
So that's a little bit, really?

00:43:34.810 --> 00:43:35.610 align:middle line:90%
>>KELLY: Yeah.

00:43:35.610 --> 00:43:38.220 align:middle line:84%
I'm like, well, maybe I forget
what they were talking about.

00:43:38.220 --> 00:43:40.220 align:middle line:10%
And I said, I don't--

00:43:40.220 --> 00:43:42.517 align:middle line:10%
do I really have to do
something about that?

00:43:42.517 --> 00:43:44.350 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: But now it's
kind of nice to know.

00:43:44.350 --> 00:43:45.590 align:middle line:84%
>>KELLY: And they said,
well, you don't have to,

00:43:45.590 --> 00:43:47.853 align:middle line:84%
but if you don't, then
when you come back,

00:43:47.853 --> 00:43:49.770 align:middle line:84%
you're going to have to
deal with the results.

00:43:49.770 --> 00:43:50.870 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Absolutely.

00:43:50.870 --> 00:43:53.060 align:middle line:84%
Well, Penny, we are
out of time and we

00:43:53.060 --> 00:43:54.750 align:middle line:90%
barely scratched the surface.

00:43:54.750 --> 00:43:57.950 align:middle line:84%
So I want to thank you so much,
and for those who didn't already

00:43:57.950 --> 00:43:59.660 align:middle line:84%
know your work, I'm
glad we had a chance

00:43:59.660 --> 00:44:00.960 align:middle line:84%
to let them get
to know you a bit.

00:44:00.960 --> 00:44:01.430 align:middle line:90%
>>KELLY: OK.

00:44:01.430 --> 00:44:02.310 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:44:02.310 --> 00:44:04.950 align:middle line:10%
