00:00:28.001 --> 00:00:29.500 align:middle line:10%
>>REGINA MEREDITH:
I've waited years

00:00:29.500 --> 00:00:32.590 align:middle line:10%
to have the esteemed author
and theologian Dr. Matthew Fox

00:00:32.590 --> 00:00:33.880 align:middle line:10%
on the set with me.

00:00:33.880 --> 00:00:36.590 align:middle line:84%
A man ordained in the Roman
Catholic Church's Dominican

00:00:36.590 --> 00:00:40.370 align:middle line:84%
order, his work took on such a
breadth of teaching, much based

00:00:40.370 --> 00:00:41.810 align:middle line:84%
on the medieval
Catholic mystics,

00:00:41.810 --> 00:00:45.330 align:middle line:84%
that he was expelled from the
order by Cardinal Ratzinger.

00:00:45.330 --> 00:00:47.690 align:middle line:84%
Not deterred from his mission
of educating the public

00:00:47.690 --> 00:00:50.770 align:middle line:84%
as to the highly refined
spiritual messages offered

00:00:50.770 --> 00:00:52.910 align:middle line:84%
by these mystics,
he's with us today

00:00:52.910 --> 00:00:55.430 align:middle line:84%
to speak about the life
and times of Hildegard von

00:00:55.430 --> 00:00:57.899 align:middle line:84%
Bingen. So wonderful
to finally meet you.

00:00:57.899 --> 00:00:59.690 align:middle line:84%
>>MATTHEW FOX: Good to
be with you, Regina.

00:00:59.690 --> 00:01:00.610 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: I've been
doing this a decade,

00:01:00.610 --> 00:01:02.910 align:middle line:84%
and this is the first
time we've sat together,

00:01:02.910 --> 00:01:05.690 align:middle line:84%
and I've always loved
your story because

00:01:05.690 --> 00:01:07.710 align:middle line:84%
in the tradition of
Hildegard-- and we'll

00:01:07.710 --> 00:01:11.150 align:middle line:84%
have a second conversation about
Meister Eckhart-- you, too,

00:01:11.150 --> 00:01:15.120 align:middle line:84%
have had to stand for what you
believe should be the roots

00:01:15.120 --> 00:01:19.460 align:middle line:84%
and spiritual basis
of any order, really,

00:01:19.460 --> 00:01:22.920 align:middle line:84%
and you paid a price for it,
just like they paid a price.

00:01:22.920 --> 00:01:23.729 align:middle line:90%
>>FOX: That's true.

00:01:23.729 --> 00:01:25.520 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Let's talk
about it a little bit.

00:01:25.520 --> 00:01:28.400 align:middle line:84%
Let's talk about what happened,
and how Ratzinger came in,

00:01:28.400 --> 00:01:30.250 align:middle line:84%
and what your journey
is, because I consider

00:01:30.250 --> 00:01:32.125 align:middle line:84%
that personally-- I know
I'm a bit of rebel--

00:01:32.125 --> 00:01:36.590 align:middle line:84%
but a badge of honor--
that you had to move on.

00:01:36.590 --> 00:01:40.190 align:middle line:10%
>>FOX: Well, my book called
"Original Blessing" especially

00:01:40.190 --> 00:01:42.690 align:middle line:10%
upset the Vatican, and
Cardinal Ratzinger, of course,

00:01:42.690 --> 00:01:44.947 align:middle line:10%
was the chief inquisitor
under John Paul II.

00:01:44.947 --> 00:01:47.280 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Talk about that
because most people don't even

00:01:47.280 --> 00:01:48.920 align:middle line:84%
know that a chief
inquisitor even

00:01:48.920 --> 00:01:51.890 align:middle line:84%
exists past the days
of the Inquisition.

00:01:51.890 --> 00:01:54.214 align:middle line:10%
>>FOX: Well, of course
he didn't work around

00:01:54.214 --> 00:01:55.630 align:middle line:10%
with that title
on him, but he was

00:01:55.630 --> 00:01:58.600 align:middle line:10%
head of the Congregation
of Doctrine of Faith,

00:01:58.600 --> 00:02:01.930 align:middle line:10%
and they only changed the
name on that in the late '60s.

00:02:01.930 --> 00:02:04.510 align:middle line:10%
It used to be called the
Sacred Congregation of the Holy

00:02:04.510 --> 00:02:05.890 align:middle line:10%
Inquisition.

00:02:05.890 --> 00:02:07.450 align:middle line:90%
So it was the same place.

00:02:07.450 --> 00:02:10.440 align:middle line:84%
They met in the same rooms
in the same building,

00:02:10.440 --> 00:02:16.384 align:middle line:84%
so that's the pitiful thing
about Pope John Paul's papacy--

00:02:16.384 --> 00:02:18.050 align:middle line:84%
is that he brought
the Inquisition back,

00:02:18.050 --> 00:02:24.220 align:middle line:84%
because I'm only one of 105
theologians that were haunted,

00:02:24.220 --> 00:02:27.266 align:middle line:84%
pursued, kicked out
of their orders.

00:02:27.266 --> 00:02:28.390 align:middle line:90%
They lost their livelihood.

00:02:28.390 --> 00:02:30.240 align:middle line:90%
Some died of heart attacks.

00:02:30.240 --> 00:02:33.040 align:middle line:84%
All this happened under
John Paul II, and with it,

00:02:33.040 --> 00:02:35.490 align:middle line:84%
of course, a great
cloud of fear.

00:02:35.490 --> 00:02:40.190 align:middle line:84%
It was really a teaching that
everyone should get in line

00:02:40.190 --> 00:02:42.600 align:middle line:84%
and quit thinking,
and so you had

00:02:42.600 --> 00:02:46.430 align:middle line:84%
the dumbing down of the
Catholic Church in that papacy,

00:02:46.430 --> 00:02:49.352 align:middle line:84%
and the result--
part one, the results

00:02:49.352 --> 00:02:50.810 align:middle line:84%
was, of course, a
pedophile crisis.

00:02:50.810 --> 00:02:51.600 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Exactly.

00:02:51.600 --> 00:02:54.050 align:middle line:84%
>>FOX: Because they started
pointing bishops and cardinals

00:02:54.050 --> 00:02:56.508 align:middle line:84%
who didn't do any thinking for
themselves, who were nothing

00:02:56.508 --> 00:03:00.110 align:middle line:84%
but yes men-- and so when
a crisis like pedophilia

00:03:00.110 --> 00:03:02.130 align:middle line:84%
happened, they didn't
know what to do.

00:03:02.130 --> 00:03:05.110 align:middle line:84%
They just got it line and did
what they were told, which was,

00:03:05.110 --> 00:03:09.110 align:middle line:90%
of course, illegal and immoral.

00:03:09.110 --> 00:03:14.010 align:middle line:84%
I remember when that scandal
broke I was teaching a class,

00:03:14.010 --> 00:03:15.235 align:middle line:90%
and a woman stood up.

00:03:15.235 --> 00:03:17.080 align:middle line:84%
She said I'm an
executive in business.

00:03:17.080 --> 00:03:20.120 align:middle line:84%
She says when this
happens in business,

00:03:20.120 --> 00:03:24.960 align:middle line:84%
what goes on first is that the
CEO quits no questions asked.

00:03:24.960 --> 00:03:28.560 align:middle line:84%
He just leaves, whereas
in the Catholic Church,

00:03:28.560 --> 00:03:34.210 align:middle line:84%
they elevated the CEO,
the cardinal of Boston,

00:03:34.210 --> 00:03:37.100 align:middle line:84%
and gave him a promotion,
sent him to Rome,

00:03:37.100 --> 00:03:39.310 align:middle line:84%
where he ran a fourth
century basilica.

00:03:39.310 --> 00:03:40.794 align:middle line:90%
It was a promotion.

00:03:40.794 --> 00:03:42.210 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Do you
think the thought

00:03:42.210 --> 00:03:44.440 align:middle line:84%
is, if you elevate them,
you remove them further

00:03:44.440 --> 00:03:47.319 align:middle line:84%
from any potential inquiry
from the outside or what?

00:03:47.319 --> 00:03:49.860 align:middle line:84%
>>FOX: Well, that was certainly
the case because he literally

00:03:49.860 --> 00:03:53.970 align:middle line:84%
left Boston when the Attorney
General of Massachusetts, who

00:03:53.970 --> 00:03:56.380 align:middle line:84%
was a Roman Catholic,
came to his door

00:03:56.380 --> 00:04:01.774 align:middle line:84%
subpoenaing him to report under
oath, of course, everything

00:04:01.774 --> 00:04:02.440 align:middle line:90%
he'd been doing.

00:04:02.440 --> 00:04:04.410 align:middle line:84%
Then he fled to Rome,
and of course, he never

00:04:04.410 --> 00:04:08.779 align:middle line:84%
returned because he would
have been brought into court.

00:04:08.779 --> 00:04:10.570 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And it's
interesting because I've

00:04:10.570 --> 00:04:13.690 align:middle line:84%
done other shows that are
completely different, more that

00:04:13.690 --> 00:04:15.490 align:middle line:84%
touched on the
subject of pedophilia,

00:04:15.490 --> 00:04:17.870 align:middle line:84%
and it's interesting,
because the diocese of Boston

00:04:17.870 --> 00:04:19.801 align:middle line:84%
always seems to
come into the story.

00:04:19.801 --> 00:04:21.800 align:middle line:84%
>>FOX: Well, they were
the first where it really

00:04:21.800 --> 00:04:23.920 align:middle line:90%
hit the national news.

00:04:23.920 --> 00:04:26.960 align:middle line:84%
Although actually in
California, there's

00:04:26.960 --> 00:04:31.030 align:middle line:84%
a marvelous Sister who blew
the whistle on pedophilia

00:04:31.030 --> 00:04:33.000 align:middle line:84%
before the Cardinal
Law thing blew.

00:04:33.000 --> 00:04:35.600 align:middle line:84%
She was from the
Santa Rosa diocese,

00:04:35.600 --> 00:04:40.740 align:middle line:84%
and she was amazing because
everyone told her to shut up.

00:04:40.740 --> 00:04:42.540 align:middle line:84%
She went first to
church officials who

00:04:42.540 --> 00:04:44.210 align:middle line:90%
did nothing for three years.

00:04:44.210 --> 00:04:45.740 align:middle line:90%
Then she went to a journalist.

00:04:45.740 --> 00:04:48.970 align:middle line:84%
Within 48 hours, the story
was all over America,

00:04:48.970 --> 00:04:51.250 align:middle line:84%
and she had the
courage to do that.

00:04:51.250 --> 00:04:52.900 align:middle line:90%
She paid a price for it, too.

00:04:52.900 --> 00:04:54.650 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: As many have
throughout history.

00:04:54.650 --> 00:04:56.890 align:middle line:84%
We're going to be talking
about some of them,

00:04:56.890 --> 00:05:00.260 align:middle line:84%
and the brave ones paid
a very high price, which

00:05:00.260 --> 00:05:03.810 align:middle line:84%
we'll talk about, maybe when we
get to our second conversation,

00:05:03.810 --> 00:05:06.030 align:middle line:84%
but again, this
notion that you go up

00:05:06.030 --> 00:05:09.510 align:middle line:84%
against the church
with the little c,

00:05:09.510 --> 00:05:12.620 align:middle line:84%
and this has kind of flowed
through the work of Hildegard,

00:05:12.620 --> 00:05:19.400 align:middle line:84%
who we're going to get into in
a moment in that she-- let's

00:05:19.400 --> 00:05:21.032 align:middle line:84%
start with the
words original sin.

00:05:21.032 --> 00:05:22.490 align:middle line:84%
I think maybe that's
the best place

00:05:22.490 --> 00:05:28.420 align:middle line:84%
to begin because it seems
like those words are

00:05:28.420 --> 00:05:33.100 align:middle line:84%
at the crux of an old way of
doing religion and the more

00:05:33.100 --> 00:05:36.180 align:middle line:84%
mystical and inclusive
way of doing religion,

00:05:36.180 --> 00:05:38.220 align:middle line:90%
including Catholicism.

00:05:38.220 --> 00:05:40.430 align:middle line:90%
>>FOX: Definitely.

00:05:40.430 --> 00:05:42.980 align:middle line:84%
Remember that Jesus never
heard of original sin.

00:05:42.980 --> 00:05:45.080 align:middle line:84%
No Jew has ever heard
of original sin.

00:05:45.080 --> 00:05:46.580 align:middle line:84%
The first person
who coined the word

00:05:46.580 --> 00:05:49.820 align:middle line:84%
was Augustine, Saint Augustine
in the fourth century, which

00:05:49.820 --> 00:05:52.590 align:middle line:84%
by the way, is the same century
that the church inherited

00:05:52.590 --> 00:05:53.970 align:middle line:90%
the Roman Empire.

00:05:53.970 --> 00:05:55.470 align:middle line:84%
If you're going
to run an empire,

00:05:55.470 --> 00:05:58.840 align:middle line:84%
original sin is a good idea
because it gets people in line,

00:05:58.840 --> 00:06:03.300 align:middle line:84%
and it makes them very obedient,
and they'll go to war for you,

00:06:03.300 --> 00:06:09.950 align:middle line:84%
but the truth is that Bible
Genesis 1 says it's good.

00:06:09.950 --> 00:06:11.090 align:middle line:90%
It's very good.

00:06:11.090 --> 00:06:14.910 align:middle line:84%
Well, original blessing--
blessing means goodness.

00:06:14.910 --> 00:06:17.230 align:middle line:84%
It's the Latin
word for goodness.

00:06:17.230 --> 00:06:21.220 align:middle line:84%
So the Bible doesn't
begin that way,

00:06:21.220 --> 00:06:23.420 align:middle line:84%
and Jews have never
heard of original sin,

00:06:23.420 --> 00:06:26.720 align:middle line:84%
so why are you building religion
in Jesus' name on original sin?

00:06:26.720 --> 00:06:28.990 align:middle line:84%
Well, because it serves
a certain interest,

00:06:28.990 --> 00:06:33.852 align:middle line:90%
and it makes people subservient.

00:06:33.852 --> 00:06:35.310 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: It creates
a fear factor.

00:06:35.310 --> 00:06:36.700 align:middle line:90%
>>FOX: It creates a fear factor.

00:06:36.700 --> 00:06:38.490 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Fearful people
are easily controlled.

00:06:38.490 --> 00:06:41.000 align:middle line:84%
>>FOX: Exactly, and of course,
it's very, very patriarchal.

00:06:41.000 --> 00:06:43.350 align:middle line:84%
Adrienne Rich,
the feminist poet,

00:06:43.350 --> 00:06:48.220 align:middle line:84%
talks about the fatalistic
self-hatred that men carry,

00:06:48.220 --> 00:06:53.060 align:middle line:84%
and I think that original sin--
it's a very patriarchal thing.

00:06:53.060 --> 00:06:57.180 align:middle line:84%
Women, and of course
as more fathers

00:06:57.180 --> 00:06:59.420 align:middle line:84%
are present for
childbirth-- it's

00:06:59.420 --> 00:07:02.850 align:middle line:84%
hard to believe that this being
you're bringing into the world

00:07:02.850 --> 00:07:06.540 align:middle line:84%
somehow has a fundamental
defect and flaw.

00:07:06.540 --> 00:07:08.300 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Was brought
in through sin.

00:07:08.300 --> 00:07:09.370 align:middle line:90%
>>FOX: Exactly.

00:07:09.370 --> 00:07:12.730 align:middle line:84%
And I had Native American
teachers-- one of them

00:07:12.730 --> 00:07:15.540 align:middle line:84%
was a Catholic sister,
as well, Franciscan--

00:07:15.540 --> 00:07:17.550 align:middle line:84%
who said we can't
believe in original sin.

00:07:17.550 --> 00:07:19.630 align:middle line:84%
We know how wonderful
all of nature is,

00:07:19.630 --> 00:07:23.350 align:middle line:84%
so we just memorized what
the priest tells us to say

00:07:23.350 --> 00:07:24.600 align:middle line:90%
when it's time for baptism.

00:07:24.600 --> 00:07:26.440 align:middle line:84%
We give him what
he wants to hear.

00:07:26.440 --> 00:07:28.820 align:middle line:84%
Meanwhile, we know that
everything that nature gives

00:07:28.820 --> 00:07:31.961 align:middle line:90%
birth to is beautiful and holy.

00:07:31.961 --> 00:07:34.460 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And this was very
much the spirit of Hildegard von

00:07:34.460 --> 00:07:34.570 align:middle line:90%
Bingen.

00:07:34.570 --> 00:07:36.090 align:middle line:84%
>>FOX: Very much the
spirit of Hildegard.

00:07:36.090 --> 00:07:38.381 align:middle line:10%
In fact, I'll tell you the
very first time I translated

00:07:38.381 --> 00:07:41.660 align:middle line:10%
her works, and I
read her in class--

00:07:41.660 --> 00:07:43.160 align:middle line:10%
I read one of her
poems, a marvelous

00:07:43.160 --> 00:07:48.710 align:middle line:10%
poem about the dew on the
grasses that cause us to laugh

00:07:48.710 --> 00:07:52.190 align:middle line:10%
and all this marvelous imagery--
the first one to speak up,

00:07:52.190 --> 00:07:53.770 align:middle line:10%
he said-- this
guy said I've just

00:07:53.770 --> 00:07:57.640 align:middle line:10%
come from living 16 years
on an Indian reservation.

00:07:57.640 --> 00:08:02.220 align:middle line:84%
That woman you just cited
sounds like the medicine man

00:08:02.220 --> 00:08:04.270 align:middle line:90%
who was my spiritual director.

00:08:04.270 --> 00:08:06.980 align:middle line:84%
So here you have-- I
was really blown away--

00:08:06.980 --> 00:08:12.010 align:middle line:84%
a 12th century German
abbess sounding

00:08:12.010 --> 00:08:15.100 align:middle line:84%
like a Native American
teacher in the 20th century.

00:08:15.100 --> 00:08:15.750 align:middle line:90%
What is this?

00:08:15.750 --> 00:08:17.416 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Well, it
makes sense if you're

00:08:17.416 --> 00:08:18.780 align:middle line:90%
talking about essential truths.

00:08:18.780 --> 00:08:21.670 align:middle line:84%
>>FOX: Exactly, and the
sacredness of creation.

00:08:21.670 --> 00:08:24.440 align:middle line:84%
And what's so wonderful
about these medieval mystics

00:08:24.440 --> 00:08:27.390 align:middle line:84%
is that they're premodern
because a modern consciousness

00:08:27.390 --> 00:08:28.800 align:middle line:90%
is so anthropocentric.

00:08:28.800 --> 00:08:33.440 align:middle line:84%
It's so humancentric,
and so you begin with sin

00:08:33.440 --> 00:08:35.100 align:middle line:84%
because humans do
do a lot of sinning.

00:08:35.100 --> 00:08:40.230 align:middle line:84%
We're pretty good at it, but you
don't begin with original sin.

00:08:40.230 --> 00:08:43.159 align:middle line:84%
Now we know the universe
is 13.8 billion years old,

00:08:43.159 --> 00:08:45.460 align:middle line:84%
so there was no sin
until humans came.

00:08:45.460 --> 00:08:46.870 align:middle line:90%
That's pretty late in the game.

00:08:46.870 --> 00:08:51.430 align:middle line:84%
To talk about the original
blessing that creation has been

00:08:51.430 --> 00:08:56.470 align:middle line:84%
is pretty easy to do today given
that the new story from science

00:08:56.470 --> 00:08:58.240 align:middle line:84%
of how we got
here-- so we've had

00:08:58.240 --> 00:09:01.780 align:middle line:84%
13.8 billion years of blessing
that have gotten us here.

00:09:01.780 --> 00:09:05.820 align:middle line:84%
Without many decisions
that the universe made,

00:09:05.820 --> 00:09:07.670 align:middle line:90%
we wouldn't have the Earth.

00:09:07.670 --> 00:09:11.970 align:middle line:84%
We wouldn't have the oxygen
fine tuned on the Earth.

00:09:11.970 --> 00:09:14.350 align:middle line:84%
We wouldn't have all
these marvelous beings

00:09:14.350 --> 00:09:15.600 align:middle line:90%
that we share the planet with.

00:09:15.600 --> 00:09:16.980 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Nature's bounty.

00:09:16.980 --> 00:09:19.760 align:middle line:84%
>>FOX: Nature's bounty,
and it preceded humans,

00:09:19.760 --> 00:09:22.640 align:middle line:84%
so it's a blessing,
original blessing,

00:09:22.640 --> 00:09:25.620 align:middle line:84%
and we too are part of
the goodness of creation.

00:09:25.620 --> 00:09:29.620 align:middle line:84%
Obviously we're also capable
of great harm as well,

00:09:29.620 --> 00:09:31.179 align:middle line:84%
and Hildegard speaks
out about that.

00:09:31.179 --> 00:09:32.220 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah, she does.

00:09:32.220 --> 00:09:33.780 align:middle line:90%
>>FOX: She's very ecological.

00:09:33.780 --> 00:09:36.280 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Let's kind of set up
little bit of the background.

00:09:36.280 --> 00:09:38.130 align:middle line:84%
First in a broader
category we'll

00:09:38.130 --> 00:09:41.080 align:middle line:84%
talk about the Rhineland
mystics, who they were,

00:09:41.080 --> 00:09:46.180 align:middle line:84%
and this particular region,
why so much fertility came out

00:09:46.180 --> 00:09:47.330 align:middle line:90%
of that region.

00:09:47.330 --> 00:09:51.840 align:middle line:84%
>>FOX: Well, I'll tell you the
Celts settled down the Rhine,

00:09:51.840 --> 00:09:53.820 align:middle line:84%
and you have to give
them the credit, I think,

00:09:53.820 --> 00:09:58.100 align:middle line:84%
for understanding Christianity
very differently from Augustine

00:09:58.100 --> 00:10:02.300 align:middle line:84%
and the southern Europeans,
because the Celts never

00:10:02.300 --> 00:10:06.370 align:middle line:84%
lost the context of
cosmology and nature,

00:10:06.370 --> 00:10:07.950 align:middle line:90%
and the beauty of nature.

00:10:07.950 --> 00:10:11.160 align:middle line:84%
They're very close, again,
to Native American awareness

00:10:11.160 --> 00:10:12.980 align:middle line:84%
because they were
indigenous like that,

00:10:12.980 --> 00:10:15.290 align:middle line:84%
and of course, Ireland
and Wales are not

00:10:15.290 --> 00:10:17.070 align:middle line:90%
easy places to survive in.

00:10:17.070 --> 00:10:18.390 align:middle line:90%
It's rough living.

00:10:18.390 --> 00:10:22.300 align:middle line:84%
Their soil is very shallow,
and it's tough going.

00:10:22.300 --> 00:10:27.200 align:middle line:84%
So there is an inner strength
to the Celtic spirit as well,

00:10:27.200 --> 00:10:30.210 align:middle line:84%
and Hildegard was raised
to the Celtic monastery,

00:10:30.210 --> 00:10:31.540 align:middle line:90%
even though she was German.

00:10:31.540 --> 00:10:34.580 align:middle line:84%
The Celts settled in that
area of Germany for sure,

00:10:34.580 --> 00:10:36.980 align:middle line:84%
and that's where she
got her basic training.

00:10:36.980 --> 00:10:41.880 align:middle line:84%
Not from the guilt ridden
and anthropocentric theology

00:10:41.880 --> 00:10:46.210 align:middle line:84%
of Augustine in the south
but from the Celtic approach

00:10:46.210 --> 00:10:50.654 align:middle line:84%
to the cosmic Christ, the
Christ of the universe.

00:10:50.654 --> 00:10:52.820 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Would that have
been partly an inheritance

00:10:52.820 --> 00:10:55.540 align:middle line:90%
of druidism, for example?

00:10:55.540 --> 00:10:58.000 align:middle line:84%
Her incredible
connection with nature?

00:10:58.000 --> 00:11:00.790 align:middle line:84%
>>FOX: Well, there is
that kind of overlap.

00:11:00.790 --> 00:11:06.520 align:middle line:84%
And also Hinduism because really
the Celts come from India,

00:11:06.520 --> 00:11:10.320 align:middle line:84%
and so there are greater
hints of Hinduism

00:11:10.320 --> 00:11:13.342 align:middle line:90%
in a lot of the Celtic theology.

00:11:13.342 --> 00:11:15.300 align:middle line:84%
They have a lot in common,
like the celebration

00:11:15.300 --> 00:11:17.790 align:middle line:90%
of birthing and mother god.

00:11:17.790 --> 00:11:20.980 align:middle line:84%
You see, the divine
feminine, and Irish women

00:11:20.980 --> 00:11:24.170 align:middle line:84%
tend to be very strong, like
Saint Bridget and others,

00:11:24.170 --> 00:11:27.270 align:middle line:84%
and so the honoring of
the strength of womanhood

00:11:27.270 --> 00:11:31.000 align:middle line:84%
is-- you don't have
the sexism in the North

00:11:31.000 --> 00:11:32.800 align:middle line:84%
that you have so
much in the South

00:11:32.800 --> 00:11:36.190 align:middle line:84%
because the issue
isn't to control women

00:11:36.190 --> 00:11:41.170 align:middle line:84%
or even to control nature
but to get along with nature

00:11:41.170 --> 00:11:46.150 align:middle line:84%
and to celebrate it, and to
honor, and to respect it.

00:11:46.150 --> 00:11:49.460 align:middle line:90%


00:11:49.460 --> 00:11:51.970 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: In that conversation
is the relationship

00:11:51.970 --> 00:11:53.980 align:middle line:84%
with the cosmic
Christ, and this is

00:11:53.980 --> 00:11:56.560 align:middle line:84%
something you've devoted a
good amount of your work to,

00:11:56.560 --> 00:11:57.460 align:middle line:90%
as well.

00:11:57.460 --> 00:12:00.220 align:middle line:84%
So let's talk about
Christ on the cross

00:12:00.220 --> 00:12:03.680 align:middle line:90%
versus the cosmic Christ.

00:12:03.680 --> 00:12:07.220 align:middle line:84%
>>FOX: Well, the cosmic
Christ is about the image

00:12:07.220 --> 00:12:10.990 align:middle line:90%
of God in every being.

00:12:10.990 --> 00:12:14.826 align:middle line:90%
We are all images of God.

00:12:14.826 --> 00:12:16.700 align:middle line:84%
In the East, they call
it the Buddha nature--

00:12:16.700 --> 00:12:24.160 align:middle line:84%
that every being expresses
an image of the divine.

00:12:24.160 --> 00:12:26.990 align:middle line:84%
So it just opens
things up so much.

00:12:26.990 --> 00:12:29.000 align:middle line:84%
As you say, it's not
just about the guilt

00:12:29.000 --> 00:12:31.940 align:middle line:84%
of Jesus on the cross,
but it's about--

00:12:31.940 --> 00:12:34.790 align:middle line:84%
and again, the earliest
writer about the cosmic Christ

00:12:34.790 --> 00:12:37.540 align:middle line:84%
is the first writer in
the Christian Bible, Paul.

00:12:37.540 --> 00:12:40.790 align:middle line:84%
He talks about Christ
holds everything together

00:12:40.790 --> 00:12:42.220 align:middle line:90%
in heaven in the Earth.

00:12:42.220 --> 00:12:46.080 align:middle line:84%
That's pretty cosmic,
and that's actually

00:12:46.080 --> 00:12:50.730 align:middle line:84%
taken from the wisdom literature
of Israel and the Hebrew Bible,

00:12:50.730 --> 00:12:54.950 align:middle line:84%
and of course Christ is the
wisdom, incarnated wisdom.

00:12:54.950 --> 00:12:58.490 align:middle line:84%
Now, Hildegard is very aware
that wisdom is feminine.

00:12:58.490 --> 00:13:01.460 align:middle line:84%
She has a whole
beautiful vision where

00:13:01.460 --> 00:13:07.990 align:middle line:84%
she talks about how the
maker of the world is love,

00:13:07.990 --> 00:13:09.280 align:middle line:90%
and love is feminine.

00:13:09.280 --> 00:13:13.680 align:middle line:84%
She goes on and on about this
and as pure original blessing

00:13:13.680 --> 00:13:19.720 align:middle line:84%
theology, and it comes from the
wisdom literature of Israel.

00:13:19.720 --> 00:13:21.960 align:middle line:84%
For example, Book
of Proverbs says,

00:13:21.960 --> 00:13:25.610 align:middle line:84%
I, wisdom was with God before
the creation of the world,

00:13:25.610 --> 00:13:27.960 align:middle line:84%
playing and delighting to be
with the sons and daughters

00:13:27.960 --> 00:13:29.251 align:middle line:90%
of the human race and so forth.

00:13:29.251 --> 00:13:33.530 align:middle line:84%
So the whole sense of play,
eros, joy, celebration--

00:13:33.530 --> 00:13:36.180 align:middle line:84%
this is everywhere
in Hildegard's work,

00:13:36.180 --> 00:13:39.510 align:middle line:84%
and it is the
tradition of wisdom

00:13:39.510 --> 00:13:41.459 align:middle line:90%
and of the cosmic Christ.

00:13:41.459 --> 00:13:43.500 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Let's talk about
her from an early age.

00:13:43.500 --> 00:13:46.570 align:middle line:84%
Set us up and tell us about
her life, her early life,

00:13:46.570 --> 00:13:50.110 align:middle line:84%
and where she started really
expressing these divine,

00:13:50.110 --> 00:13:52.880 align:middle line:90%
passionate visions.

00:13:52.880 --> 00:13:57.102 align:middle line:84%
>>FOX: Well, she was the 10th of
10 children, and at that time,

00:13:57.102 --> 00:13:58.560 align:middle line:84%
sometimes when you
had 10 children,

00:13:58.560 --> 00:14:02.730 align:middle line:84%
you would tithe the 10th
to the church, so to speak,

00:14:02.730 --> 00:14:05.050 align:middle line:84%
but she had visions from the
time she was little girl,

00:14:05.050 --> 00:14:07.160 align:middle line:84%
but she didn't share
them with anybody.

00:14:07.160 --> 00:14:12.170 align:middle line:84%
And to make a long story short,
when she was a young girl,

00:14:12.170 --> 00:14:13.990 align:middle line:84%
she was put in
the care of Jutta,

00:14:13.990 --> 00:14:17.090 align:middle line:84%
who was a hermitess associated
with the monastery there.

00:14:17.090 --> 00:14:18.760 align:middle line:84%
And by the way,
Celtic monasteries

00:14:18.760 --> 00:14:20.790 align:middle line:90%
had men and women in them.

00:14:20.790 --> 00:14:24.770 align:middle line:84%
Different wings you might
see, but one monastery,

00:14:24.770 --> 00:14:26.780 align:middle line:84%
which again proves the
Celts weren't all hung up

00:14:26.780 --> 00:14:28.520 align:middle line:84%
on sex like
Augustine and company

00:14:28.520 --> 00:14:30.926 align:middle line:90%
were, and the Church still is.

00:14:30.926 --> 00:14:34.690 align:middle line:90%


00:14:34.690 --> 00:14:36.750 align:middle line:84%
So she was trained by
Jutta, who obviously

00:14:36.750 --> 00:14:40.130 align:middle line:84%
was a very bright
woman, because Hildegard

00:14:40.130 --> 00:14:43.030 align:middle line:84%
was a brilliant writer
and thinker and scientist

00:14:43.030 --> 00:14:44.130 align:middle line:90%
and musician.

00:14:44.130 --> 00:14:46.600 align:middle line:84%
And of course, this Benedictine
tradition into which she

00:14:46.600 --> 00:14:52.810 align:middle line:84%
was enfolded was very rich and
of course was-- at that time,

00:14:52.810 --> 00:14:55.500 align:middle line:84%
you're in the dark ages--
was keeping things together,

00:14:55.500 --> 00:14:59.400 align:middle line:84%
if you will, in terms of
scholarship and leadership

00:14:59.400 --> 00:15:03.620 align:middle line:84%
in the Church, but
when Jutta died,

00:15:03.620 --> 00:15:05.640 align:middle line:84%
Hildegard was
elected the abbess,

00:15:05.640 --> 00:15:10.990 align:middle line:84%
the woman leader in the
monastery, but after a while,

00:15:10.990 --> 00:15:13.740 align:middle line:84%
she-- well, when she
wrote her first book,

00:15:13.740 --> 00:15:17.180 align:middle line:84%
it became so famous overnight
the pope endorsed it.

00:15:17.180 --> 00:15:20.494 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Did he understand it?

00:15:20.494 --> 00:15:22.160 align:middle line:84%
>>FOX: I think so,
but he was encouraged

00:15:22.160 --> 00:15:25.620 align:middle line:84%
by Bernard of Clairvaux,
who was his friend,

00:15:25.620 --> 00:15:28.760 align:middle line:84%
and Bernard was a
big shot, trying

00:15:28.760 --> 00:15:30.930 align:middle line:84%
to reform the order
of men while she

00:15:30.930 --> 00:15:32.760 align:middle line:90%
was trying to reform the women.

00:15:32.760 --> 00:15:35.810 align:middle line:84%
And back then when a
pope approved a book,

00:15:35.810 --> 00:15:37.410 align:middle line:90%
it sold better.

00:15:37.410 --> 00:15:39.990 align:middle line:84%
Today when they disapprove,
it tends sell better.

00:15:39.990 --> 00:15:44.450 align:middle line:84%
That's my experience,
but the truth

00:15:44.450 --> 00:15:46.470 align:middle line:84%
is that women flooded the
monastery because they

00:15:46.470 --> 00:15:49.160 align:middle line:84%
wanted to study with this
woman, and they were very proud

00:15:49.160 --> 00:15:49.660 align:middle line:90%
of her.

00:15:49.660 --> 00:15:52.224 align:middle line:84%
Her first book
contained an opera.

00:15:52.224 --> 00:15:53.640 align:middle line:84%
It's the oldest
opera in the West.

00:15:53.640 --> 00:15:55.140 align:middle line:90%
It contained paintings.

00:15:55.140 --> 00:15:57.757 align:middle line:84%
She didn't stick to
just one method at all.

00:15:57.757 --> 00:15:59.090 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: What an amazing woman.

00:15:59.090 --> 00:15:59.870 align:middle line:90%
>>FOX: Amazing woman.

00:15:59.870 --> 00:16:01.030 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: She was a
force of creativity.

00:16:01.030 --> 00:16:02.699 align:middle line:84%
>>FOX: A force of
creativity, and you

00:16:02.699 --> 00:16:04.240 align:middle line:84%
could just see it
in that first book.

00:16:04.240 --> 00:16:05.280 align:middle line:90%
It's all over the place.

00:16:05.280 --> 00:16:06.480 align:middle line:10%
It's marvelous.

00:16:06.480 --> 00:16:08.050 align:middle line:10%
There's science, theology.

00:16:08.050 --> 00:16:10.290 align:middle line:10%
She hits on
everything, but there

00:16:10.290 --> 00:16:13.400 align:middle line:10%
wasn't room in the women's
end of the monastery for all

00:16:13.400 --> 00:16:16.910 align:middle line:10%
the women that were coming, so
she asked the men to move over,

00:16:16.910 --> 00:16:19.190 align:middle line:10%
and they wouldn't, so
she got up and left

00:16:19.190 --> 00:16:21.070 align:middle line:10%
with her women
and their dowries.

00:16:21.070 --> 00:16:23.490 align:middle line:84%
Back then a nun had
to have a dowry.

00:16:23.490 --> 00:16:27.900 align:middle line:84%
These were upperclass women, and
she created her own monastery--

00:16:27.900 --> 00:16:29.940 align:middle line:84%
two of them, eventually--
and she built them.

00:16:29.940 --> 00:16:31.472 align:middle line:90%
She was the architect.

00:16:31.472 --> 00:16:33.680 align:middle line:84%
I think it was the first
monastery with running water

00:16:33.680 --> 00:16:37.280 align:middle line:84%
in it, and we have letters
from the abbot saying,

00:16:37.280 --> 00:16:39.094 align:middle line:84%
come back, come
back with your nuns,

00:16:39.094 --> 00:16:40.510 align:middle line:84%
and bring their
dowries with them.

00:16:40.510 --> 00:16:41.884 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: With
them, I read that.

00:16:41.884 --> 00:16:44.490 align:middle line:84%
>>FOX: And she said it's
a matter of justice,

00:16:44.490 --> 00:16:46.230 align:middle line:90%
and she did not return at all.

00:16:46.230 --> 00:16:47.860 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: No, and
again in this art

00:16:47.860 --> 00:16:50.020 align:middle line:84%
work that we're speaking
of, there was always

00:16:50.020 --> 00:16:53.900 align:middle line:84%
the representational kind
of cosmic egg, the feminine,

00:16:53.900 --> 00:16:57.440 align:middle line:84%
the birth being given
to all, to the cosmos

00:16:57.440 --> 00:16:59.945 align:middle line:90%
through the feminine impulse.

00:16:59.945 --> 00:17:00.570 align:middle line:90%
>>FOX: Exactly.

00:17:00.570 --> 00:17:02.510 align:middle line:84%
And the cosmos as
a living being.

00:17:02.510 --> 00:17:03.060 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Yes, as
a living being.

00:17:03.060 --> 00:17:04.560 align:middle line:84%
>>FOX: And this is
our understanding

00:17:04.560 --> 00:17:08.540 align:middle line:84%
of Gaia today, and indeed of
today's postmodern science.

00:17:08.540 --> 00:17:11.089 align:middle line:84%
The nearest thing to
the universe today,

00:17:11.089 --> 00:17:13.160 align:middle line:84%
as Rupert Sheldrake
the scientist says,

00:17:13.160 --> 00:17:16.710 align:middle line:84%
is an organism, whereas
in the modern era

00:17:16.710 --> 00:17:19.560 align:middle line:84%
we're thinking of the universe
as a machine as if it's done,

00:17:19.560 --> 00:17:22.869 align:middle line:84%
but we know the universe
began smaller than a zygote.

00:17:22.869 --> 00:17:24.240 align:middle line:90%
Well, there you go.

00:17:24.240 --> 00:17:25.410 align:middle line:90%
12th century thinking.

00:17:25.410 --> 00:17:26.280 align:middle line:90%
It was an egg.

00:17:26.280 --> 00:17:27.280 align:middle line:90%
And what is an egg?

00:17:27.280 --> 00:17:28.640 align:middle line:90%
It's an incipient being.

00:17:28.640 --> 00:17:30.850 align:middle line:84%
It's just the
beginning of something.

00:17:30.850 --> 00:17:34.580 align:middle line:84%
So evolution is built into
that kind of consciousness,

00:17:34.580 --> 00:17:36.250 align:middle line:84%
and not something
to be afraid of.

00:17:36.250 --> 00:17:38.870 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Right, and another
beautiful piece of work

00:17:38.870 --> 00:17:41.510 align:middle line:84%
was herself having
her awakening,

00:17:41.510 --> 00:17:44.080 align:middle line:84%
and again, it was just
like this cosmic fire

00:17:44.080 --> 00:17:46.350 align:middle line:84%
coming down into
the top of her head.

00:17:46.350 --> 00:17:49.360 align:middle line:84%
Talk about that piece a
little bit and her awakening,

00:17:49.360 --> 00:17:53.210 align:middle line:84%
and was she known to have
any kind of migraines

00:17:53.210 --> 00:17:55.940 align:middle line:84%
or such with these
visions sometimes?

00:17:55.940 --> 00:17:57.790 align:middle line:84%
>>FOX: Yes, she
was quite sickly.

00:17:57.790 --> 00:18:00.200 align:middle line:84%
It's amazing she lived
to be well in her 80s

00:18:00.200 --> 00:18:03.840 align:middle line:84%
with all the-- let's
just say-- struggles

00:18:03.840 --> 00:18:07.790 align:middle line:90%
that she had, but yes.

00:18:07.790 --> 00:18:11.242 align:middle line:84%
She tells us that
image that she paints

00:18:11.242 --> 00:18:12.700 align:middle line:84%
with the fire coming
down-- this is

00:18:12.700 --> 00:18:14.970 align:middle line:90%
like the apostles at Pentecost.

00:18:14.970 --> 00:18:18.150 align:middle line:84%
So she's comparing herself
to the apostles at Pentecost.

00:18:18.150 --> 00:18:19.234 align:middle line:90%
The Holy Spirit is coming.

00:18:19.234 --> 00:18:20.941 align:middle line:84%
She didn't have a bad
opinion of herself.

00:18:20.941 --> 00:18:22.126 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: No, she did not.

00:18:22.126 --> 00:18:23.080 align:middle line:90%
Good for her.

00:18:23.080 --> 00:18:25.314 align:middle line:84%
>>FOX: Good for her,
exactly, and good for us.

00:18:25.314 --> 00:18:26.980 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And good
for us, because we're

00:18:26.980 --> 00:18:29.542 align:middle line:84%
talking about-- the term
you use is pantheism,

00:18:29.542 --> 00:18:31.250 align:middle line:84%
and then there's
another one beyond that.

00:18:31.250 --> 00:18:31.749 align:middle line:90%
Panentheism?

00:18:31.749 --> 00:18:32.660 align:middle line:90%
>>FOX: Panentheism.

00:18:32.660 --> 00:18:34.420 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And if you can
talk about that a little bit

00:18:34.420 --> 00:18:36.130 align:middle line:84%
as pertains back to
what we were just

00:18:36.130 --> 00:18:38.930 align:middle line:84%
talking about with Hildegard,
her perception of self,

00:18:38.930 --> 00:18:43.540 align:middle line:84%
of other, of planet, of
plants, of animals, of cosmos?

00:18:43.540 --> 00:18:45.780 align:middle line:84%
>>FOX: Well again, the
cosmic Christ that God

00:18:45.780 --> 00:18:47.790 align:middle line:84%
is in everything, and
everything is in God.

00:18:47.790 --> 00:18:52.690 align:middle line:84%
That's panentheism, and
she saw the world that way,

00:18:52.690 --> 00:18:57.990 align:middle line:84%
as mystics do and especially
because she was so nature

00:18:57.990 --> 00:19:01.850 align:middle line:84%
centered-- and of course, she
did so much healing through

00:19:01.850 --> 00:19:04.129 align:middle line:90%
herbs and stones, even--

00:19:04.129 --> 00:19:04.920 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Crystals.

00:19:04.920 --> 00:19:07.640 align:middle line:90%
>>FOX: --crystals.

00:19:07.640 --> 00:19:08.930 align:middle line:90%
She wrote books on this.

00:19:08.930 --> 00:19:11.650 align:middle line:84%
There's a whole clinic
in Germany today

00:19:11.650 --> 00:19:14.090 align:middle line:84%
that's been running for,
I think, 40 years now,

00:19:14.090 --> 00:19:16.130 align:middle line:84%
which is devoted
entirely to her medicine.

00:19:16.130 --> 00:19:19.240 align:middle line:84%
MDs were there and devoted
their life to this,

00:19:19.240 --> 00:19:22.060 align:middle line:84%
and they're using
exclusively her medicine,

00:19:22.060 --> 00:19:24.720 align:middle line:84%
and a lot of her medicine
is very holistic,

00:19:24.720 --> 00:19:27.030 align:middle line:84%
and of course, a
lot of it is diet,

00:19:27.030 --> 00:19:30.480 align:middle line:84%
but it's also about--
versus stress.

00:19:30.480 --> 00:19:31.870 align:middle line:90%
It's psychological, too.

00:19:31.870 --> 00:19:34.300 align:middle line:84%
You see, it's all the
elements of the human

00:19:34.300 --> 00:19:36.980 align:middle line:84%
that she incorporates
into her healing process.

00:19:36.980 --> 00:19:39.320 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Do you think
that maybe her journey had

00:19:39.320 --> 00:19:42.620 align:middle line:84%
to do with the fact that her own
body was rather weak and sickly

00:19:42.620 --> 00:19:44.960 align:middle line:90%
and that was part of her search?

00:19:44.960 --> 00:19:47.570 align:middle line:84%
>>FOX: I suspect that
probably is part of it,

00:19:47.570 --> 00:19:51.551 align:middle line:84%
but also she was the abbess
of many sisters and nuns.

00:19:51.551 --> 00:19:53.050 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Well, you
had to have ways

00:19:53.050 --> 00:19:54.100 align:middle line:90%
of taking care of each other.

00:19:54.100 --> 00:19:55.800 align:middle line:84%
>>FOX: Ways of taking
care of them too.

00:19:55.800 --> 00:19:58.840 align:middle line:84%
But she had these
insights about rocks,

00:19:58.840 --> 00:20:02.890 align:middle line:84%
about animals,
about diet, plants,

00:20:02.890 --> 00:20:08.970 align:middle line:84%
and many of these
insights current doctors

00:20:08.970 --> 00:20:13.130 align:middle line:90%
and medicine have substantiated.

00:20:13.130 --> 00:20:15.060 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: You've written
two previous-- I just

00:20:15.060 --> 00:20:15.790 align:middle line:90%
want to bring this up.

00:20:15.790 --> 00:20:17.830 align:middle line:84%
You've written two previous
books on Hildegard.

00:20:17.830 --> 00:20:20.270 align:middle line:84%
What was it that you
had not yet expressed

00:20:20.270 --> 00:20:22.460 align:middle line:90%
in writing this newest one?

00:20:22.460 --> 00:20:25.040 align:middle line:90%
>>FOX: Well, I tell you.

00:20:25.040 --> 00:20:27.060 align:middle line:84%
What motivated me
to write this book

00:20:27.060 --> 00:20:29.780 align:middle line:84%
was that I heard
the pope-- this is

00:20:29.780 --> 00:20:32.650 align:middle line:84%
Pope Ratzinger-- was going
to canonize her and name

00:20:32.650 --> 00:20:33.880 align:middle line:90%
her a doctor of the church.

00:20:33.880 --> 00:20:35.330 align:middle line:84%
Now, there have only
been three other women

00:20:35.330 --> 00:20:36.360 align:middle line:90%
named doctor of the church.

00:20:36.360 --> 00:20:37.350 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: It doesn't make sense.

00:20:37.350 --> 00:20:37.650 align:middle line:90%
>>FOX: That's a big deal.

00:20:37.650 --> 00:20:39.525 align:middle line:84%
>>FOX: They get rid of
you, but they're going

00:20:39.525 --> 00:20:40.760 align:middle line:90%
to essentially canonize her.

00:20:40.760 --> 00:20:44.220 align:middle line:84%
What was it Ratzinger
wasn't on to here?

00:20:44.220 --> 00:20:46.980 align:middle line:84%
>>FOX: Well, he was
very naive, I think.

00:20:46.980 --> 00:20:49.340 align:middle line:84%
My last chapter in
this book is called

00:20:49.340 --> 00:20:51.807 align:middle line:84%
"Is Hildegard a Trojan
Horse in the Vatican?"

00:20:51.807 --> 00:20:52.640 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: I love it.

00:20:52.640 --> 00:20:55.060 align:middle line:84%
>>FOX: The answer is
yes because he did not

00:20:55.060 --> 00:20:59.100 align:middle line:84%
realize that her big thing
is the divine feminine.

00:20:59.100 --> 00:21:01.220 align:middle line:84%
I mean, that's why you
have to believe in irony.

00:21:01.220 --> 00:21:01.630 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: How
could he miss that?

00:21:01.630 --> 00:21:03.300 align:middle line:90%
Had he not read anything by her?

00:21:03.300 --> 00:21:06.902 align:middle line:84%
>>FOX: Well, he hadn't
read her correctly.

00:21:06.902 --> 00:21:09.235 align:middle line:84%
Everything depends on what
glasses you read people with.

00:21:09.235 --> 00:21:11.400 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: He didn't look
at her artwork, perhaps?

00:21:11.400 --> 00:21:11.870 align:middle line:90%
>>FOX: That's right.

00:21:11.870 --> 00:21:12.790 align:middle line:90%
He didn't get it.

00:21:12.790 --> 00:21:13.550 align:middle line:90%
He didn't get it.

00:21:13.550 --> 00:21:17.490 align:middle line:84%
He only sees his view of the
world, and you see he's German.

00:21:17.490 --> 00:21:19.110 align:middle line:90%
That's why he canonized her.

00:21:19.110 --> 00:21:19.580 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Oh,
because she's German.

00:21:19.580 --> 00:21:20.280 align:middle line:84%
>>FOX: She's a
famous German saint.

00:21:20.280 --> 00:21:21.150 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Well, there you go.

00:21:21.150 --> 00:21:23.190 align:middle line:84%
>>FOX: And all that,
but he didn't go deeply.

00:21:23.190 --> 00:21:24.648 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Lucky
for the rest of us.

00:21:24.648 --> 00:21:26.492 align:middle line:84%
>>FOX: He had no idea
what he was doing,

00:21:26.492 --> 00:21:27.450 align:middle line:90%
and I knew he wouldn't.

00:21:27.450 --> 00:21:28.866 align:middle line:84%
That's why I had
to rush the book.

00:21:28.866 --> 00:21:32.400 align:middle line:84%
I heard in January this was
going to happen in September,

00:21:32.400 --> 00:21:35.710 align:middle line:84%
so I looked for a publisher
who would get a book published

00:21:35.710 --> 00:21:36.880 align:middle line:90%
before September.

00:21:36.880 --> 00:21:38.130 align:middle line:90%
It's very hard to find.

00:21:38.130 --> 00:21:41.810 align:middle line:84%
I found this woman,
Constance, in Vancouver,

00:21:41.810 --> 00:21:43.950 align:middle line:84%
and she told me
later that I told her

00:21:43.950 --> 00:21:45.480 align:middle line:84%
about Hildegard,
whom she had not

00:21:45.480 --> 00:21:48.310 align:middle line:84%
heard of-- she was on the
ceiling for three nights,

00:21:48.310 --> 00:21:49.110 align:middle line:90%
she said.

00:21:49.110 --> 00:21:50.940 align:middle line:84%
She couldn't sleep
she was so excited,

00:21:50.940 --> 00:21:52.680 align:middle line:84%
but she came through
just as promised.

00:21:52.680 --> 00:21:54.910 align:middle line:84%
Of course, I had to
write the book fast,

00:21:54.910 --> 00:21:57.050 align:middle line:84%
but I had been teaching
her for 40 years ago,

00:21:57.050 --> 00:21:59.720 align:middle line:84%
and I hadn't written a
book about her in 30 years,

00:21:59.720 --> 00:22:03.310 align:middle line:84%
so I had plenty of material,
but I had to rush this thing in,

00:22:03.310 --> 00:22:04.810 align:middle line:84%
and then she had
a get it printed,

00:22:04.810 --> 00:22:07.660 align:middle line:84%
and it did come out a month
before the canonization.

00:22:07.660 --> 00:22:09.890 align:middle line:84%
And I'll tell you,
what the Vatican wrote

00:22:09.890 --> 00:22:11.900 align:middle line:84%
when she was declared
an official saint,

00:22:11.900 --> 00:22:14.440 align:middle line:84%
was so boring it was
like an encyclopedia

00:22:14.440 --> 00:22:16.260 align:middle line:90%
article with facts.

00:22:16.260 --> 00:22:19.060 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: It didn't
capture her spirit.

00:22:19.060 --> 00:22:19.810 align:middle line:90%
>>FOX: None of it.

00:22:19.810 --> 00:22:20.060 align:middle line:90%
None.

00:22:20.060 --> 00:22:21.251 align:middle line:90%
They didn't get it at all.

00:22:21.251 --> 00:22:22.250 align:middle line:90%
They still don't get it.

00:22:22.250 --> 00:22:25.070 align:middle line:84%
Of course, it is about the
return of the divine feminine.

00:22:25.070 --> 00:22:26.200 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Absolutely.

00:22:26.200 --> 00:22:28.880 align:middle line:84%
So one of her great
teachings was we

00:22:28.880 --> 00:22:30.990 align:middle line:84%
touched on the opposite
at the beginning

00:22:30.990 --> 00:22:33.070 align:middle line:84%
the conversation--
original sin-- she

00:22:33.070 --> 00:22:34.865 align:middle line:90%
believed in original wisdom.

00:22:34.865 --> 00:22:35.490 align:middle line:90%
>>FOX: Exactly.

00:22:35.490 --> 00:22:38.610 align:middle line:84%
That was her
phrase, and she says

00:22:38.610 --> 00:22:40.580 align:middle line:84%
that we are born with
this wisdom in us,

00:22:40.580 --> 00:22:42.940 align:middle line:84%
but it's folded up
like a tent, and she

00:22:42.940 --> 00:22:45.280 align:middle line:84%
paints a picture of this,
because we're just so little.

00:22:45.280 --> 00:22:45.880 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: There's
depiction of it, yes.

00:22:45.880 --> 00:22:47.088 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: So I'll fold it up.

00:22:47.088 --> 00:22:49.590 align:middle line:84%
So she says the process
of growing in life

00:22:49.590 --> 00:22:54.430 align:middle line:84%
is setting up this tent, this
tent of wisdom, and remember,

00:22:54.430 --> 00:22:59.140 align:middle line:84%
she gets this from John I--
that the word came and set up

00:22:59.140 --> 00:23:00.910 align:middle line:84%
his tent among us,
and that, again,

00:23:00.910 --> 00:23:03.800 align:middle line:84%
is taken from the wisdom
literature of Israel.

00:23:03.800 --> 00:23:05.650 align:middle line:10%
So she paints this
painting, where

00:23:05.650 --> 00:23:09.000 align:middle line:10%
she has the-- first she has
the child in the womb receiving

00:23:09.000 --> 00:23:12.230 align:middle line:10%
this tent folded up,
but then on the side she

00:23:12.230 --> 00:23:14.320 align:middle line:10%
has the stages of a
person setting it up.

00:23:14.320 --> 00:23:15.903 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: It's
interesting because you

00:23:15.903 --> 00:23:18.680 align:middle line:84%
can see in the image
the enslavement

00:23:18.680 --> 00:23:21.830 align:middle line:84%
of the soul and
the being as it has

00:23:21.830 --> 00:23:23.540 align:middle line:84%
to rise through all
these challenges

00:23:23.540 --> 00:23:25.176 align:middle line:84%
like on the right
side of the picture.

00:23:25.176 --> 00:23:25.800 align:middle line:90%
>>FOX: Exactly.

00:23:25.800 --> 00:23:27.634 align:middle line:84%
Climbing up mountains,
fording rivers.

00:23:27.634 --> 00:23:29.050 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Dealing
with the demons.

00:23:29.050 --> 00:23:31.470 align:middle line:84%
>>FOX: Wrestling with
alligators and demons-- all

00:23:31.470 --> 00:23:35.890 align:middle line:84%
that-- but at the top
then, the tent is set up,

00:23:35.890 --> 00:23:38.640 align:middle line:84%
and that's her naming of I
think of what Jung would call

00:23:38.640 --> 00:23:41.730 align:middle line:84%
the individuation process,
the process of growing

00:23:41.730 --> 00:23:45.680 align:middle line:84%
up and becoming your
true self and your mature

00:23:45.680 --> 00:23:48.000 align:middle line:90%
and humanity coming to the fore.

00:23:48.000 --> 00:23:53.040 align:middle line:84%
So it's is a marvelous statement
and telling the story of what

00:23:53.040 --> 00:23:54.930 align:middle line:90%
it is to be a human being.

00:23:54.930 --> 00:23:56.880 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And she
also- one of things

00:23:56.880 --> 00:24:00.300 align:middle line:84%
I just loved about her
work as you represented,

00:24:00.300 --> 00:24:05.580 align:middle line:84%
is that she believed
in full creativity.

00:24:05.580 --> 00:24:09.490 align:middle line:84%
She believed in the erotic
nature of just being alive,

00:24:09.490 --> 00:24:11.850 align:middle line:84%
and on the planet, and
having five senses,

00:24:11.850 --> 00:24:13.840 align:middle line:90%
and this being our divine right.

00:24:13.840 --> 00:24:17.190 align:middle line:84%
She used the term
juicy, which I just

00:24:17.190 --> 00:24:21.710 align:middle line:84%
love-- that life-- give us
some more idea of what she did,

00:24:21.710 --> 00:24:22.690 align:middle line:90%
what she meant by that.

00:24:22.690 --> 00:24:25.040 align:middle line:84%
>>FOX: She says the only
sin in life is drying up,

00:24:25.040 --> 00:24:26.925 align:middle line:84%
and she wrote this
to abbots and bishops

00:24:26.925 --> 00:24:28.990 align:middle line:84%
and archbishops, and
said you're drying up.

00:24:28.990 --> 00:24:30.190 align:middle line:90%
Get out of your libraries.

00:24:30.190 --> 00:24:35.160 align:middle line:84%
Do something to get wet and
green and moist and juicy.

00:24:35.160 --> 00:24:36.090 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Beautiful.

00:24:36.090 --> 00:24:38.540 align:middle line:84%
>>FOX: It's beautiful, and it's
all about creativity, isn't it?

00:24:38.540 --> 00:24:40.480 align:middle line:84%
And that word green is
very important to her.

00:24:40.480 --> 00:24:43.350 align:middle line:84%
She invented a word
in Latin, "veriditas,"

00:24:43.350 --> 00:24:45.930 align:middle line:84%
which means greening
power, and she says

00:24:45.930 --> 00:24:47.270 align:middle line:90%
this is a power of creativity.

00:24:47.270 --> 00:24:48.790 align:middle line:90%
It's a power of the Holy Spirit.

00:24:48.790 --> 00:24:51.330 align:middle line:84%
It's the sap in
the tree, she says.

00:24:51.330 --> 00:24:53.140 align:middle line:90%
The Holy Spirit is green.

00:24:53.140 --> 00:24:56.730 align:middle line:84%
Now also, of course, green is
the color of the heart chakra.

00:24:56.730 --> 00:25:00.000 align:middle line:84%
It's the color of love,
therefore, the middle chakra.

00:25:00.000 --> 00:25:02.230 align:middle line:90%
So she's honoring all that.

00:25:02.230 --> 00:25:05.080 align:middle line:84%
She even talks about
Christ as a green man

00:25:05.080 --> 00:25:07.720 align:middle line:84%
because a green man was very
big in the 12th century.

00:25:07.720 --> 00:25:09.790 align:middle line:84%
It came in with the goddess
in the 12th century.

00:25:09.790 --> 00:25:10.970 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Yes, talk
about the green man a bit

00:25:10.970 --> 00:25:12.772 align:middle line:84%
and the green man
mythology, so to speak.

00:25:12.772 --> 00:25:14.230 align:middle line:84%
>>FOX: Well, the
green man is often

00:25:14.230 --> 00:25:18.490 align:middle line:84%
depicted with bows coming out
of his fish chakra, his mouth,

00:25:18.490 --> 00:25:22.825 align:middle line:84%
and then the bows come around
him like a wreath sometimes,

00:25:22.825 --> 00:25:27.710 align:middle line:84%
and in this wreath are birds
singing and grapes growing.

00:25:27.710 --> 00:25:30.630 align:middle line:84%
It's all about generativity,
the generativity

00:25:30.630 --> 00:25:36.150 align:middle line:84%
of nature, the plant world,
and human beings, and men too.

00:25:36.150 --> 00:25:37.650 align:middle line:84%
Remember, she was
living at the time

00:25:37.650 --> 00:25:44.210 align:middle line:84%
when the goddess was roaring
into the West in full force.

00:25:44.210 --> 00:25:48.370 align:middle line:84%
The last time the goddess
returned to Western culture

00:25:48.370 --> 00:25:51.630 align:middle line:84%
was the 12th century as she's
returning now in our time,

00:25:51.630 --> 00:25:53.220 align:middle line:84%
but I love with
the goddess comes

00:25:53.220 --> 00:25:58.749 align:middle line:84%
the green man on her
coattails, you might say,

00:25:58.749 --> 00:26:00.290 align:middle line:84%
because the green
man is to remind us

00:26:00.290 --> 00:26:03.830 align:middle line:84%
that men too, have the power
of the goddess within us.

00:26:03.830 --> 00:26:07.490 align:middle line:84%
We, too, are generative, and
it gives a much better context

00:26:07.490 --> 00:26:09.700 align:middle line:84%
for our sexuality and
for all kinds of issues

00:26:09.700 --> 00:26:12.762 align:middle line:90%
that men often stumble over.

00:26:12.762 --> 00:26:14.470 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: I believe
you said in this book

00:26:14.470 --> 00:26:18.200 align:middle line:84%
that it was partly an extension
of your book, "The Hidden

00:26:18.200 --> 00:26:23.451 align:middle line:84%
Spirituality of Men," so
let's talk about that flow.

00:26:23.451 --> 00:26:25.700 align:middle line:84%
>>FOX: Well, I think the
return of the divine feminine

00:26:25.700 --> 00:26:28.960 align:middle line:84%
is one thing, but the divine
feminine, or the goddess,

00:26:28.960 --> 00:26:31.040 align:middle line:84%
deserves a worthy
consort, so that

00:26:31.040 --> 00:26:32.940 align:middle line:84%
means we've got to
have healthy masculine,

00:26:32.940 --> 00:26:37.020 align:middle line:84%
but I think that the truth is
a lot of masculinity has become

00:26:37.020 --> 00:26:41.240 align:middle line:84%
sour and toxic the
last few centuries,

00:26:41.240 --> 00:26:43.580 align:middle line:84%
and we have to clean
up the masculine

00:26:43.580 --> 00:26:45.670 align:middle line:84%
and get to the sacred
masculine again.

00:26:45.670 --> 00:26:48.880 align:middle line:84%
So I wrote that book on that
topic, and the key to it what

00:26:48.880 --> 00:26:52.470 align:middle line:84%
was I came up with
10 archetypes that

00:26:52.470 --> 00:26:54.560 align:middle line:90%
name a healthy masculinity.

00:26:54.560 --> 00:26:58.360 align:middle line:84%
The green man is one-- father
sky, spiritual warrior,

00:26:58.360 --> 00:26:59.752 align:middle line:90%
hunter gatherer, the blue man.

00:26:59.752 --> 00:27:01.710 align:middle line:84%
Hildegard has a whole
painting of the blue man.

00:27:01.710 --> 00:27:05.060 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Yes, talk about
the blue man for a moment.

00:27:05.060 --> 00:27:07.950 align:middle line:84%
>>FOX: And the blue
man is-- for Hildegard,

00:27:07.950 --> 00:27:11.410 align:middle line:84%
she calls it the healing
Christ that's in everybody.

00:27:11.410 --> 00:27:13.914 align:middle line:84%
We're all capable of this
power of healing and notice

00:27:13.914 --> 00:27:14.830 align:middle line:90%
what the man is doing.

00:27:14.830 --> 00:27:18.670 align:middle line:84%
He's doing this, and this is
an archetype for compassion

00:27:18.670 --> 00:27:22.910 align:middle line:84%
because it's about putting your
heart energy into your hands,

00:27:22.910 --> 00:27:25.350 align:middle line:84%
doing something, but
out of your heart, not

00:27:25.350 --> 00:27:30.510 align:middle line:84%
out of fame, or power, and
so on, but out of heart.

00:27:30.510 --> 00:27:33.230 align:middle line:84%
So it's an amazing vision
she had of the blue man

00:27:33.230 --> 00:27:37.070 align:middle line:84%
that she paints here,
and it's interesting

00:27:37.070 --> 00:27:41.560 align:middle line:84%
because Swami Muktanada in the
20th century, a Hindu saint,

00:27:41.560 --> 00:27:46.360 align:middle line:84%
had a vision of the blue man
that morphed from being a pearl

00:27:46.360 --> 00:27:48.762 align:middle line:84%
entry-- a blue pearl
then into a blue man,

00:27:48.762 --> 00:27:50.720 align:middle line:84%
and he said it was the
most powerful meditation

00:27:50.720 --> 00:27:51.420 align:middle line:90%
of his life.

00:27:51.420 --> 00:27:52.420 align:middle line:90%
It changed him.

00:27:52.420 --> 00:27:54.380 align:middle line:90%
He overcame his fear of death.

00:27:54.380 --> 00:27:56.810 align:middle line:84%
It empowered him
with his creativity

00:27:56.810 --> 00:28:00.070 align:middle line:84%
and especially his power
of compassion and healing.

00:28:00.070 --> 00:28:03.600 align:middle line:84%
Well, he writes about that in
the 20th century from the east.

00:28:03.600 --> 00:28:06.910 align:middle line:84%
Hildegard wrote about having
a similar vision from the West

00:28:06.910 --> 00:28:08.160 align:middle line:90%
in the 12th century.

00:28:08.160 --> 00:28:11.330 align:middle line:84%
She also mentions a
pearl in her vision.

00:28:11.330 --> 00:28:12.004 align:middle line:90%
Why the pearl?

00:28:12.004 --> 00:28:12.920 align:middle line:90%
Well, what is a pearl?

00:28:12.920 --> 00:28:15.750 align:middle line:84%
It's an imperfection
in an oyster

00:28:15.750 --> 00:28:17.470 align:middle line:84%
that gets worked
over by the sand

00:28:17.470 --> 00:28:18.900 align:middle line:90%
and the tides and the ocean.

00:28:18.900 --> 00:28:20.280 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: To create
this lustrous thing.

00:28:20.280 --> 00:28:21.238 align:middle line:90%
>>FOX: To create a gem.

00:28:21.238 --> 00:28:22.472 align:middle line:90%
That's who we are.

00:28:22.472 --> 00:28:26.990 align:middle line:84%
We got our imperfections, but we
get worked over by life itself,

00:28:26.990 --> 00:28:28.761 align:middle line:90%
and we become gem-like.

00:28:28.761 --> 00:28:30.010 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: This lustrous thing.

00:28:30.010 --> 00:28:30.926 align:middle line:90%
>>FOX: Lustrous thing.

00:28:30.926 --> 00:28:34.312 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: What about the
depictions of Krishna in blue?

00:28:34.312 --> 00:28:35.770 align:middle line:84%
>>FOX: Well, Krishna
is a blue man.

00:28:35.770 --> 00:28:36.480 align:middle line:90%
That's right.

00:28:36.480 --> 00:28:37.190 align:middle line:90%
That's right.

00:28:37.190 --> 00:28:38.580 align:middle line:90%
That's right.

00:28:38.580 --> 00:28:40.830 align:middle line:90%
There's that from the East, too.

00:28:40.830 --> 00:28:43.530 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And when we
talk about the green man,

00:28:43.530 --> 00:28:47.400 align:middle line:84%
going back into how this
flowed into some of what you've

00:28:47.400 --> 00:28:50.190 align:middle line:84%
written about in this
recent Hildegard book,

00:28:50.190 --> 00:28:52.930 align:middle line:90%
she was really an ecologist.

00:28:52.930 --> 00:28:57.880 align:middle line:84%
She couldn't separate the
cosmos from what we have,

00:28:57.880 --> 00:28:59.125 align:middle line:90%
the bounty of Earth itself.

00:28:59.125 --> 00:28:59.870 align:middle line:90%
>>FOX: Exactly.

00:28:59.870 --> 00:29:02.830 align:middle line:84%
There's one more reason we
have to listen to her today.

00:29:02.830 --> 00:29:03.940 align:middle line:90%
She's very strong.

00:29:03.940 --> 00:29:07.320 align:middle line:84%
She says humans and
the rest of creation

00:29:07.320 --> 00:29:10.310 align:middle line:84%
are bound up in a
web of life, and she

00:29:10.310 --> 00:29:16.660 align:middle line:84%
says if humans destroy
the rest of creation,

00:29:16.660 --> 00:29:19.610 align:middle line:84%
God will allow creation
to destroy humanity.

00:29:19.610 --> 00:29:21.210 align:middle line:84%
Now, notice she's
not saying that God

00:29:21.210 --> 00:29:23.450 align:middle line:84%
is going to destroy us,
but the creation is--

00:29:23.450 --> 00:29:26.580 align:middle line:84%
the droughts, the hurricanes,
everything that is happening,

00:29:26.580 --> 00:29:28.640 align:middle line:84%
the disappearance of
species, of water,

00:29:28.640 --> 00:29:31.450 align:middle line:84%
is happening everywhere with
climate change, all this.

00:29:31.450 --> 00:29:34.310 align:middle line:84%
She is saying that we are in a
web with the rest of creation.

00:29:34.310 --> 00:29:37.580 align:middle line:84%
We better pay attention, and
we'd better be humble enough

00:29:37.580 --> 00:29:39.610 align:middle line:90%
not to go around raping it.

00:29:39.610 --> 00:29:40.920 align:middle line:90%
So she's very strong.

00:29:40.920 --> 00:29:42.830 align:middle line:84%
She says the Earth
must not be injured.

00:29:42.830 --> 00:29:45.129 align:middle line:90%
The Earth must not be destroyed.

00:29:45.129 --> 00:29:46.670 align:middle line:84%
So she has this
consciousness, again,

00:29:46.670 --> 00:29:49.020 align:middle line:84%
that's like Native American,
a consciousness-- we're

00:29:49.020 --> 00:29:50.480 align:middle line:90%
part of a web.

00:29:50.480 --> 00:29:54.170 align:middle line:84%
The world isn't
here just for us.

00:29:54.170 --> 00:29:56.610 align:middle line:84%
The anthropocentrism that's
destroying the planet

00:29:56.610 --> 00:30:01.070 align:middle line:84%
finds no home in Hildegard or
really any of these premodern

00:30:01.070 --> 00:30:04.610 align:middle line:84%
thinkers as it finds no home
in indigenous consciousness

00:30:04.610 --> 00:30:05.160 align:middle line:90%
either.

00:30:05.160 --> 00:30:08.770 align:middle line:84%
We're part of a bigger
hoop, as Black Elk says.

00:30:08.770 --> 00:30:10.700 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And as
she views it, we

00:30:10.700 --> 00:30:14.837 align:middle line:84%
are the co-creators with the
cosmic Christ, the God hat.

00:30:14.837 --> 00:30:15.670 align:middle line:90%
>>FOX: That's right.

00:30:15.670 --> 00:30:17.310 align:middle line:90%
She uses that term co-creator.

00:30:17.310 --> 00:30:20.220 align:middle line:84%
Absolutely, and she's so
keen on our creativity,

00:30:20.220 --> 00:30:22.760 align:middle line:84%
and of course, that's
so important today

00:30:22.760 --> 00:30:26.750 align:middle line:84%
because what can get us out
of the corner into which we've

00:30:26.750 --> 00:30:29.430 align:middle line:84%
painted ourselves
except our creativity.

00:30:29.430 --> 00:30:31.330 align:middle line:84%
Like in India today,
they've invented a car

00:30:31.330 --> 00:30:34.710 align:middle line:90%
that runs on compressed air.

00:30:34.710 --> 00:30:36.270 align:middle line:84%
That's pretty
creative, isn't it?

00:30:36.270 --> 00:30:38.270 align:middle line:84%
That might be good
for the planet.

00:30:38.270 --> 00:30:43.240 align:middle line:84%
After all, there's no bad no
toxic fumes from all that.

00:30:43.240 --> 00:30:45.240 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: She would have
been blogging about it.

00:30:45.240 --> 00:30:45.930 align:middle line:90%
>>FOX: Exactly.

00:30:45.930 --> 00:30:47.890 align:middle line:90%
She would've been creating.

00:30:47.890 --> 00:30:51.087 align:middle line:84%
She would have been an engineer
today creating alternatives.

00:30:51.087 --> 00:30:52.170 align:middle line:90%
That's what we have to do.

00:30:52.170 --> 00:30:56.230 align:middle line:10%
We have to put all kinds of
emphasis on creativity today,

00:30:56.230 --> 00:30:58.500 align:middle line:10%
but is this happening
in education?

00:30:58.500 --> 00:30:59.840 align:middle line:90%
No.

00:30:59.840 --> 00:31:04.540 align:middle line:84%
When there's a credit
crunch on education,

00:31:04.540 --> 00:31:07.370 align:middle line:84%
out go theater, out go
music, out go dance and art.

00:31:07.370 --> 00:31:07.890 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: All the
arts are gone first.

00:31:07.890 --> 00:31:10.306 align:middle line:84%
>>FOX: All the arts are gone,
as if that's not what counts

00:31:10.306 --> 00:31:13.490 align:middle line:84%
and having a computer
is all that counts.

00:31:13.490 --> 00:31:18.260 align:middle line:84%
It's crazy, and Hildegard
would be very vocal about that.

00:31:18.260 --> 00:31:21.260 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: How did she
express her feelings

00:31:21.260 --> 00:31:25.540 align:middle line:84%
about the controlling
patriarchy of the day?

00:31:25.540 --> 00:31:27.610 align:middle line:84%
>>FOX: Well, she
didn't keep them in.

00:31:27.610 --> 00:31:27.990 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: No, she didn't.

00:31:27.990 --> 00:31:29.281 align:middle line:90%
>>FOX: She didn't repress them.

00:31:29.281 --> 00:31:30.350 align:middle line:90%
She didn't get depressed.

00:31:30.350 --> 00:31:30.950 align:middle line:90%
She put them out there.

00:31:30.950 --> 00:31:32.060 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: It's amazing
what she got away

00:31:32.060 --> 00:31:34.731 align:middle line:84%
with saying considering what
other people were burned for.

00:31:34.731 --> 00:31:35.480 align:middle line:90%
>>FOX: Absolutely.

00:31:35.480 --> 00:31:37.910 align:middle line:84%
She wrote letters to
the emperor telling him

00:31:37.910 --> 00:31:40.910 align:middle line:84%
he was acting like a baby
and telling him to man up.

00:31:40.910 --> 00:31:42.291 align:middle line:90%
She wrote letters to the pope.

00:31:42.291 --> 00:31:43.790 align:middle line:84%
She wrote letters
to the pope saying

00:31:43.790 --> 00:31:45.670 align:middle line:84%
he was surrounded
by evil people,

00:31:45.670 --> 00:31:48.100 align:middle line:90%
and he was ignoring justice.

00:31:48.100 --> 00:31:49.590 align:middle line:84%
She wrote letters
to abbots saying

00:31:49.590 --> 00:31:52.370 align:middle line:84%
they acted like
donkeys and bears,

00:31:52.370 --> 00:31:54.724 align:middle line:84%
groaning and moaning and
complaining, all the time.

00:31:54.724 --> 00:31:55.390 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Asses.

00:31:55.390 --> 00:31:56.190 align:middle line:90%
>>FOX: Self-pity.

00:31:56.190 --> 00:31:59.780 align:middle line:84%
Oh, she wrote into
bishops-- she preached

00:31:59.780 --> 00:32:01.660 align:middle line:84%
all over Germany
and Switzerland,

00:32:01.660 --> 00:32:03.700 align:middle line:84%
and her main theme was
the corrupt clergy.

00:32:03.700 --> 00:32:06.890 align:middle line:84%
That was her main topic, and
we have a letter from a bishop

00:32:06.890 --> 00:32:09.100 align:middle line:84%
saying they're still
talking about your sermon,

00:32:09.100 --> 00:32:10.910 align:middle line:90%
and you left three months ago.

00:32:10.910 --> 00:32:13.190 align:middle line:84%
Would you send us a
copy of your sermon?

00:32:13.190 --> 00:32:17.950 align:middle line:84%
So she did not hold back,
and she was very fierce.

00:32:17.950 --> 00:32:20.810 align:middle line:84%
She has a thing about
how the sea of Peter

00:32:20.810 --> 00:32:24.470 align:middle line:84%
is going to be
destroyed, and this

00:32:24.470 --> 00:32:27.620 align:middle line:84%
is one reason that one of
Martin Luther's early followers,

00:32:27.620 --> 00:32:32.250 align:middle line:84%
Osiander-- he said Hildegard
was first Protestant, which

00:32:32.250 --> 00:32:35.550 align:middle line:84%
is amazing because she was
400 years before Luther,

00:32:35.550 --> 00:32:37.290 align:middle line:84%
and she was a
Benedictine abbess,

00:32:37.290 --> 00:32:40.300 align:middle line:84%
but she was a Protestant
insofar as she was protesting.

00:32:40.300 --> 00:32:41.730 align:middle line:90%
She did not hold it in.

00:32:41.730 --> 00:32:47.470 align:middle line:84%
She was very aware of the
corruption of the clergy.

00:32:47.470 --> 00:32:51.256 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Why was she not
taken down in her day?

00:32:51.256 --> 00:32:53.130 align:middle line:84%
We'll talk about what
happened later in life,

00:32:53.130 --> 00:32:56.660 align:middle line:84%
but while she was so outspoken
and out there among the people,

00:32:56.660 --> 00:32:57.890 align:middle line:90%
why wasn't she taken down?

00:32:57.890 --> 00:32:59.015 align:middle line:90%
>>FOX: Well, I'll tell you.

00:32:59.015 --> 00:33:02.850 align:middle line:84%
I think that they all
heard about her visions,

00:33:02.850 --> 00:33:06.040 align:middle line:84%
the hierarchy and
patriarchy, and I

00:33:06.040 --> 00:33:08.630 align:middle line:84%
think they were afraid this
might really be authentic,

00:33:08.630 --> 00:33:11.300 align:middle line:84%
that she might really be
getting messages from God,

00:33:11.300 --> 00:33:13.560 align:middle line:84%
and they didn't want
to Fuss with that.

00:33:13.560 --> 00:33:14.580 align:middle line:90%
That's one thing.

00:33:14.580 --> 00:33:16.560 align:middle line:84%
Also, of course, an
abbess at that time

00:33:16.560 --> 00:33:17.940 align:middle line:90%
was a very powerful figure.

00:33:17.940 --> 00:33:20.540 align:middle line:84%
She owned a lot of
land and property,

00:33:20.540 --> 00:33:22.030 align:middle line:90%
and it was aristocratic.

00:33:22.030 --> 00:33:24.950 align:middle line:84%
They were part of
the ruling classes,

00:33:24.950 --> 00:33:26.590 align:middle line:84%
but also remember,
she had the support

00:33:26.590 --> 00:33:29.730 align:middle line:84%
of Saint Bernard, who was
a very powerful cleric,

00:33:29.730 --> 00:33:31.350 align:middle line:90%
and the support of the pope.

00:33:31.350 --> 00:33:34.890 align:middle line:84%
So all that worked to
her favor, I think.

00:33:34.890 --> 00:33:39.750 align:middle line:84%
Also, of course, you didn't
have faxes and telephones,

00:33:39.750 --> 00:33:44.220 align:middle line:84%
so news traveled
more slowly then.

00:33:44.220 --> 00:33:45.180 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Interesting.

00:33:45.180 --> 00:33:48.570 align:middle line:84%
Now, another thing
she was noted for

00:33:48.570 --> 00:33:52.480 align:middle line:84%
was this very interesting
mystical music

00:33:52.480 --> 00:33:53.330 align:middle line:90%
that she produced.

00:33:53.330 --> 00:33:55.081 align:middle line:90%
Now, I've never heard her music.

00:33:55.081 --> 00:33:57.580 align:middle line:84%
I was hoping to hear it before
we had this conversation so I

00:33:57.580 --> 00:34:01.072 align:middle line:84%
could feel it, but first
of all, describe it,

00:34:01.072 --> 00:34:02.530 align:middle line:84%
and then we're
going to take a look

00:34:02.530 --> 00:34:03.780 align:middle line:84%
and maybe hear a
little bit of it.

00:34:03.780 --> 00:34:04.530 align:middle line:90%
>>FOX: Definitely.

00:34:04.530 --> 00:34:05.350 align:middle line:90%
It's very special.

00:34:05.350 --> 00:34:07.874 align:middle line:84%
I call it erotic
Gregorian chant.

00:34:07.874 --> 00:34:09.040 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah, interesting.

00:34:09.040 --> 00:34:11.600 align:middle line:84%
>>FOX: Because it's
so much more demanding

00:34:11.600 --> 00:34:14.520 align:middle line:84%
than any other Gregorian--
the highs, and the lows-- it's

00:34:14.520 --> 00:34:16.659 align:middle line:90%
just amazing, filled with life.

00:34:16.659 --> 00:34:18.100 align:middle line:90%
For years, I taught it.

00:34:18.100 --> 00:34:20.270 align:middle line:84%
Well, I had people
teach it in my classes,

00:34:20.270 --> 00:34:25.050 align:middle line:84%
and every time what happened
was people either quit the class

00:34:25.050 --> 00:34:27.860 align:middle line:84%
or they stayed and
got high every class.

00:34:27.860 --> 00:34:28.300 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: I was going
to ask you that.

00:34:28.300 --> 00:34:30.530 align:middle line:84%
>>FOX: Because she demands
so much air to sing.

00:34:30.530 --> 00:34:34.090 align:middle line:84%
So it was definitely a form
of yoga or spiritual practice

00:34:34.090 --> 00:34:38.179 align:middle line:84%
to sing her music because
it required you to get high,

00:34:38.179 --> 00:34:39.705 align:middle line:84%
because you bringing
so much air in

00:34:39.705 --> 00:34:41.969 align:middle line:84%
to sing because
it's so demanding,

00:34:41.969 --> 00:34:45.520 align:middle line:84%
but she wrote the oldest opera
in the West-- 300 years older

00:34:45.520 --> 00:34:48.610 align:middle line:84%
than any other-- and
her music is stunning.

00:34:48.610 --> 00:34:50.830 align:middle line:84%
It's just so beautiful
and original.

00:34:50.830 --> 00:34:52.624 align:middle line:90%
It is so original and creative.

00:34:52.624 --> 00:34:54.040 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And could
it be-- as you

00:34:54.040 --> 00:34:55.670 align:middle line:84%
say, it's kind of
all over the place--

00:34:55.670 --> 00:34:57.880 align:middle line:84%
that it simply
encompassed so much

00:34:57.880 --> 00:35:00.960 align:middle line:84%
more than, say, an
average modern opera might

00:35:00.960 --> 00:35:04.540 align:middle line:84%
in terms of the range,
tone, and so forth?

00:35:04.540 --> 00:35:05.400 align:middle line:90%
>>FOX: That's true.

00:35:05.400 --> 00:35:09.160 align:middle line:84%
I think that's true,
and one musicologist

00:35:09.160 --> 00:35:14.040 align:middle line:84%
has said that she anticipated
Mozart and some other more

00:35:14.040 --> 00:35:15.915 align:middle line:90%
modern musicians.

00:35:15.915 --> 00:35:17.540 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Anticipated
them in what way?

00:35:17.540 --> 00:35:20.800 align:middle line:84%
>>FOX: Well, for example,
she introduces motifs,

00:35:20.800 --> 00:35:23.360 align:middle line:84%
and then the motif
comes back again,

00:35:23.360 --> 00:35:27.930 align:middle line:84%
and you get this, of course,
in a lot of modern music.

00:35:27.930 --> 00:35:34.560 align:middle line:84%
And she plays with the music
in an absolutely unique way

00:35:34.560 --> 00:35:37.240 align:middle line:90%
for that time in history.

00:35:37.240 --> 00:35:39.450 align:middle line:84%
She was an absolute
genius in music.

00:35:39.450 --> 00:35:42.590 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And she played
something akin to a zither?

00:35:42.590 --> 00:35:44.840 align:middle line:84%
>>FOX: Yes, or an
organum, which is

00:35:44.840 --> 00:35:49.010 align:middle line:84%
kind of a pumping
instrument that

00:35:49.010 --> 00:35:51.170 align:middle line:84%
creates almost like
an organ, but it

00:35:51.170 --> 00:35:52.592 align:middle line:90%
was very portable and small.

00:35:52.592 --> 00:35:54.050 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Like a
little concertina?

00:35:54.050 --> 00:35:57.220 align:middle line:90%
>>FOX: Something like that, yes.

00:35:57.220 --> 00:36:01.340 align:middle line:84%
But remember, she was training
her nuns to sing these parts.

00:36:01.340 --> 00:36:05.940 align:middle line:84%
She put on these plays, these
operas, and had them dress up

00:36:05.940 --> 00:36:06.990 align:middle line:90%
and everything else.

00:36:06.990 --> 00:36:10.850 align:middle line:84%
She has the male in her
life-- her Secretary was

00:36:10.850 --> 00:36:14.880 align:middle line:84%
a monk-- he's playing
the devil in this opera,

00:36:14.880 --> 00:36:17.390 align:middle line:84%
and he goes around
talking, because she says

00:36:17.390 --> 00:36:19.030 align:middle line:90%
heaven is a place of music.

00:36:19.030 --> 00:36:22.870 align:middle line:84%
So where the devil
appears, he can't sing.

00:36:22.870 --> 00:36:24.080 align:middle line:90%
He can only talk.

00:36:24.080 --> 00:36:27.029 align:middle line:84%
By the way, when she was
excommunicated at the age of 81

00:36:27.029 --> 00:36:27.820 align:middle line:90%
by the archbishop--

00:36:27.820 --> 00:36:28.580 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Took them a while.

00:36:28.580 --> 00:36:30.111 align:middle line:84%
>>FOX: Took them
a while, but she

00:36:30.111 --> 00:36:32.110 align:middle line:84%
and all of her fellow
nuns-- there official word

00:36:32.110 --> 00:36:34.750 align:middle line:84%
is interdict because they
all were excommunicated.

00:36:34.750 --> 00:36:38.640 align:middle line:84%
She wrote him a letter saying
you silenced the most beautiful

00:36:38.640 --> 00:36:40.910 align:middle line:84%
music on the Rhine,
meaning her own,

00:36:40.910 --> 00:36:42.320 align:middle line:90%
because we're being silent.

00:36:42.320 --> 00:36:43.100 align:middle line:90%
We're obeying you.

00:36:43.100 --> 00:36:45.060 align:middle line:84%
We're not singing
anymore, and she goes on

00:36:45.060 --> 00:36:46.770 align:middle line:84%
about-- she says
prophets need music.

00:36:46.770 --> 00:36:48.330 align:middle line:90%
Prophets write music.

00:36:48.330 --> 00:36:49.970 align:middle line:84%
Prophets make
musical instruments,

00:36:49.970 --> 00:36:52.000 align:middle line:84%
but you've silenced the most
beautiful music on the Rhine.

00:36:52.000 --> 00:36:52.500 align:middle line:90%
She goes on.

00:36:52.500 --> 00:36:57.940 align:middle line:84%
She ends her letter saying,
someday you will go to a place

00:36:57.940 --> 00:36:58.940 align:middle line:90%
where there is no music.

00:36:58.940 --> 00:37:00.231 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: In other words, hell.

00:37:00.231 --> 00:37:02.420 align:middle line:84%
>>FOX: Respectfully yours--
in other words, hell.

00:37:02.420 --> 00:37:05.200 align:middle line:84%
That's why she hadn't been
canonized for 800 years--

00:37:05.200 --> 00:37:07.830 align:middle line:84%
because she told the
archbishop he was going to hell

00:37:07.830 --> 00:37:09.370 align:middle line:84%
in the most creative
way anyone's

00:37:09.370 --> 00:37:10.570 align:middle line:84%
ever told an archbishop
he's going to hell.

00:37:10.570 --> 00:37:11.120 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: That's beautiful.

00:37:11.120 --> 00:37:12.994 align:middle line:84%
>>FOX: It is very
beautiful, and it tells you

00:37:12.994 --> 00:37:15.110 align:middle line:90%
a lot about her personality.

00:37:15.110 --> 00:37:17.860 align:middle line:90%
She was not repressive.

00:37:17.860 --> 00:37:20.490 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: When you have
personally chanted her music,

00:37:20.490 --> 00:37:24.820 align:middle line:84%
what is your personal
experience of it?

00:37:24.820 --> 00:37:27.250 align:middle line:84%
>>FOX: Well, it takes you into
places of great tranquility

00:37:27.250 --> 00:37:32.760 align:middle line:84%
but also into places
of great energy.

00:37:32.760 --> 00:37:37.550 align:middle line:84%
And it takes you in places
of joy, in places of silence,

00:37:37.550 --> 00:37:43.385 align:middle line:84%
if you will, stillness,
but also places of anger.

00:37:43.385 --> 00:37:45.010 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: The full
range of expression.

00:37:45.010 --> 00:37:47.380 align:middle line:84%
>>FOX: So she runs the gamut
of the human soul, I think.

00:37:47.380 --> 00:37:47.879 align:middle line:90%
Absolutely.

00:37:47.879 --> 00:37:50.580 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So there's
a BBC documentary that

00:37:50.580 --> 00:37:54.490 align:middle line:84%
features some of her music,
and her life and work and art,

00:37:54.490 --> 00:37:57.420 align:middle line:84%
so let's take a peek at this
for a couple of minutes, OK?

00:37:57.420 --> 00:37:58.970 align:middle line:90%
>>FOX: Good idea.

00:37:58.970 --> 00:38:03.730 align:middle line:10%
[MUSIC - HILDEGARD VON BINGEN,
 "ORDO VIRTUTUM"]

00:38:03.730 --> 00:39:21.020 align:middle line:90%


00:39:21.020 --> 00:39:23.990 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: I want to see
the entire documentary.

00:39:23.990 --> 00:39:24.990 align:middle line:90%
I look forward to that.

00:39:24.990 --> 00:39:26.448 align:middle line:84%
>>FOX: I'm going
to give it to you.

00:39:26.448 --> 00:39:28.140 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: I so look
forward to that.

00:39:28.140 --> 00:39:30.617 align:middle line:90%
What a brave soul.

00:39:30.617 --> 00:39:32.950 align:middle line:84%
Not just the creativity, the
visions, and understanding,

00:39:32.950 --> 00:39:35.370 align:middle line:90%
but what courage, and we forget.

00:39:35.370 --> 00:39:39.070 align:middle line:84%
Now you have anonymous
blogsters out there basically

00:39:39.070 --> 00:39:40.920 align:middle line:84%
putting a little hate
out into the world

00:39:40.920 --> 00:39:45.080 align:middle line:84%
or a little criticism,
and nothing comes of that.

00:39:45.080 --> 00:39:47.280 align:middle line:84%
However, in that day,
you risked your life

00:39:47.280 --> 00:39:51.930 align:middle line:84%
to say some of these things, and
you risked a very painful death

00:39:51.930 --> 00:39:55.000 align:middle line:84%
if the church should
find against you.

00:39:55.000 --> 00:39:57.210 align:middle line:84%
She didn't seem to be
concerned because she was so

00:39:57.210 --> 00:39:58.730 align:middle line:90%
somehow integrated.

00:39:58.730 --> 00:40:01.780 align:middle line:84%
>>FOX: She was not
intimidated by power,

00:40:01.780 --> 00:40:06.040 align:middle line:84%
and I think she
trusted her experience,

00:40:06.040 --> 00:40:08.287 align:middle line:84%
and her experiences
taught her these things.

00:40:08.287 --> 00:40:09.870 align:middle line:84%
Again, remember, she
had these visions

00:40:09.870 --> 00:40:11.500 align:middle line:90%
from the time she was a child.

00:40:11.500 --> 00:40:19.200 align:middle line:84%
So she was in this communication
with angels, forces,

00:40:19.200 --> 00:40:23.490 align:middle line:84%
for her entire life, and
she learned to trust them.

00:40:23.490 --> 00:40:25.560 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And so she
became bolder yet.

00:40:25.560 --> 00:40:28.030 align:middle line:84%
As life went on, the
visions continued,

00:40:28.030 --> 00:40:30.150 align:middle line:84%
and she now says the
visions are the basis

00:40:30.150 --> 00:40:32.387 align:middle line:90%
of the new scriptures.

00:40:32.387 --> 00:40:33.220 align:middle line:90%
>>FOX: That's right.

00:40:33.220 --> 00:40:34.350 align:middle line:90%
She actually says that, yeah.

00:40:34.350 --> 00:40:34.650 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah, she said that.

00:40:34.650 --> 00:40:36.690 align:middle line:84%
>>FOX: She compares her
writings to the scriptures.

00:40:36.690 --> 00:40:37.130 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: The new scriptures.

00:40:37.130 --> 00:40:39.463 align:middle line:84%
>>FOX: She says people aren't
reading the Bible anymore,

00:40:39.463 --> 00:40:41.250 align:middle line:84%
so let them read
my work, she says.

00:40:41.250 --> 00:40:47.530 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So let's talk
about her new scriptures

00:40:47.530 --> 00:40:52.876 align:middle line:84%
and how that statement
was received in the time.

00:40:52.876 --> 00:40:54.500 align:middle line:84%
>>FOX: Well, it was
received very well.

00:40:54.500 --> 00:40:55.770 align:middle line:90%
That's the amazing thing.

00:40:55.770 --> 00:40:58.740 align:middle line:90%


00:40:58.740 --> 00:41:00.540 align:middle line:84%
You see, these abbots
would write letters

00:41:00.540 --> 00:41:02.484 align:middle line:84%
to her asking for
spiritual direction.

00:41:02.484 --> 00:41:04.900 align:middle line:84%
They would say, you know, I'm
having trouble with my monks

00:41:04.900 --> 00:41:09.360 align:middle line:84%
and this and that, and so she
was constantly giving advice.

00:41:09.360 --> 00:41:11.790 align:middle line:84%
She wasn't running
from authority.

00:41:11.790 --> 00:41:14.000 align:middle line:84%
She was giving
advice to authority.

00:41:14.000 --> 00:41:15.760 align:middle line:90%
So it was a different situation.

00:41:15.760 --> 00:41:17.340 align:middle line:84%
Now, one thing you
have to remember

00:41:17.340 --> 00:41:20.210 align:middle line:84%
about the 12th
century-- and think

00:41:20.210 --> 00:41:23.800 align:middle line:84%
of Eleanor of Aquitaine and
the movie "Lion in Winter"

00:41:23.800 --> 00:41:28.270 align:middle line:84%
with Katherine Hepburn-- that
was the time, the same time.

00:41:28.270 --> 00:41:30.676 align:middle line:84%
And remember, a lot
of the men, especially

00:41:30.676 --> 00:41:32.050 align:middle line:84%
the aristocratic
men, the nobles,

00:41:32.050 --> 00:41:35.950 align:middle line:84%
had gone off to the Crusades,
so the women were left home

00:41:35.950 --> 00:41:36.740 align:middle line:90%
running things.

00:41:36.740 --> 00:41:38.740 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Kind of like
in any war, World War II.

00:41:38.740 --> 00:41:40.130 align:middle line:90%
They're home making the tires.

00:41:40.130 --> 00:41:42.200 align:middle line:84%
>>FOX: Well, that's
true, and so there

00:41:42.200 --> 00:41:47.330 align:middle line:84%
was kind of an emergence of
women power, and as I said,

00:41:47.330 --> 00:41:50.940 align:middle line:84%
the abbess by definition,
or in law at that time,

00:41:50.940 --> 00:41:54.030 align:middle line:84%
was a very strong
person who owned

00:41:54.030 --> 00:41:55.337 align:middle line:90%
property and all this stuff.

00:41:55.337 --> 00:41:57.920 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So with the men away,
her visions and new scriptures

00:41:57.920 --> 00:41:58.950 align:middle line:90%
were taking hold.

00:41:58.950 --> 00:41:59.920 align:middle line:90%
>>FOX: That's right.

00:41:59.920 --> 00:42:02.840 align:middle line:84%
That's right, and
again, though, she

00:42:02.840 --> 00:42:04.650 align:middle line:84%
was so articulate--
her writings are

00:42:04.650 --> 00:42:06.850 align:middle line:84%
so powerful and rich,
including her poetry,

00:42:06.850 --> 00:42:08.480 align:middle line:90%
that it captures you.

00:42:08.480 --> 00:42:11.440 align:middle line:90%
It's hard not to pay attention.

00:42:11.440 --> 00:42:16.280 align:middle line:84%
She was brighter probably than
any of the men on the field

00:42:16.280 --> 00:42:20.630 align:middle line:84%
there, and yet she
kind of used her--

00:42:20.630 --> 00:42:24.790 align:middle line:84%
she would say I'm a simple,
uneducated woman and all this.

00:42:24.790 --> 00:42:27.320 align:middle line:84%
So she kind of used that,
I think, pretty skillfully.

00:42:27.320 --> 00:42:28.640 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah, self-effacing.

00:42:28.640 --> 00:42:30.040 align:middle line:90%
>>FOX: Self-effacing, exactly.

00:42:30.040 --> 00:42:32.630 align:middle line:84%
She used all her
charms, I think.

00:42:32.630 --> 00:42:34.000 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: All of her skills.

00:42:34.000 --> 00:42:36.570 align:middle line:84%
And so there's one
quote, "Oh, humans,

00:42:36.570 --> 00:42:39.270 align:middle line:84%
why do you live
without passion?"

00:42:39.270 --> 00:42:41.522 align:middle line:84%
That was one of my
favorite lines in the book.

00:42:41.522 --> 00:42:42.480 align:middle line:90%
>>FOX: I love that too.

00:42:42.480 --> 00:42:43.813 align:middle line:90%
Why do you live without passion?

00:42:43.813 --> 00:42:45.280 align:middle line:90%
Why do you live without blood?

00:42:45.280 --> 00:42:47.155 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Yes, why do
you live without blood?

00:42:47.155 --> 00:42:49.300 align:middle line:90%
>>FOX: So she's about passion.

00:42:49.300 --> 00:42:50.640 align:middle line:90%
Life is to be lived.

00:42:50.640 --> 00:42:51.380 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Including sexuality.

00:42:51.380 --> 00:42:51.860 align:middle line:90%
All of it.

00:42:51.860 --> 00:42:53.234 align:middle line:84%
It's all part of
nature and life.

00:42:53.234 --> 00:42:54.010 align:middle line:90%
>>FOX: Exactly.

00:42:54.010 --> 00:42:54.540 align:middle line:90%
All of it.

00:42:54.540 --> 00:42:57.835 align:middle line:84%
It is to be lived, and another
place she talks about worship,

00:42:57.835 --> 00:43:03.200 align:middle line:84%
and she says that you must be
an alive, enthusiastic offering

00:43:03.200 --> 00:43:04.960 align:middle line:90%
on the altar of God.

00:43:04.960 --> 00:43:07.360 align:middle line:84%
The worship should
have energy to it.

00:43:07.360 --> 00:43:11.390 align:middle line:84%
It's not about finding the right
page to read a prayer from.

00:43:11.390 --> 00:43:14.460 align:middle line:84%
It's about developing
energy, about becoming

00:43:14.460 --> 00:43:17.060 align:middle line:84%
more of an agent
of transformation,

00:43:17.060 --> 00:43:21.390 align:middle line:84%
becoming stronger, more
courageous, more imaginative.

00:43:21.390 --> 00:43:23.790 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And so for her,
that's all an expression

00:43:23.790 --> 00:43:25.830 align:middle line:90%
of the divine feminine.

00:43:25.830 --> 00:43:28.030 align:middle line:84%
And so for her,
the Earth itself is

00:43:28.030 --> 00:43:30.550 align:middle line:84%
an expression of the feminine,
so of course, everything

00:43:30.550 --> 00:43:37.390 align:middle line:84%
that the Earth offers us is
part of that divine worship

00:43:37.390 --> 00:43:38.720 align:middle line:90%
you were just speaking of.

00:43:38.720 --> 00:43:42.930 align:middle line:84%
>>FOX: Well, that's right, and
like so many medieval people--

00:43:42.930 --> 00:43:44.680 align:middle line:84%
like Francis, who
came right after her.

00:43:44.680 --> 00:43:47.280 align:middle line:84%
He was born two
years after she died.

00:43:47.280 --> 00:43:49.260 align:middle line:84%
She had an
understanding of Gaia,

00:43:49.260 --> 00:43:54.660 align:middle line:84%
of Earth as a living being
that was noble in itself,

00:43:54.660 --> 00:43:58.470 align:middle line:84%
and she talks a lot
about how God is round.

00:43:58.470 --> 00:44:02.140 align:middle line:84%
She says we are encircled by
the arms of the mystery of God,

00:44:02.140 --> 00:44:04.340 align:middle line:84%
and that's very
motherly, you see.

00:44:04.340 --> 00:44:08.970 align:middle line:84%
That's part of her imagery
of the divine feminine,

00:44:08.970 --> 00:44:11.320 align:middle line:84%
but there are many
examples of her

00:44:11.320 --> 00:44:12.760 align:middle line:90%
pushing the divine feminine.

00:44:12.760 --> 00:44:14.430 align:middle line:84%
For example, her
talking about Mary--

00:44:14.430 --> 00:44:16.390 align:middle line:84%
she calls Mary the
ground of all being.

00:44:16.390 --> 00:44:17.140 align:middle line:90%
That's astounding.

00:44:17.140 --> 00:44:20.070 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Which was
picked up all throughout--

00:44:20.070 --> 00:44:22.610 align:middle line:84%
over the next 800 years,
that same statement was

00:44:22.610 --> 00:44:23.724 align:middle line:90%
picked up again by others.

00:44:23.724 --> 00:44:25.390 align:middle line:84%
>>FOX: Right, but it
was applied to God.

00:44:25.390 --> 00:44:26.473 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: To God, exactly.

00:44:26.473 --> 00:44:27.390 align:middle line:90%
>>FOX: Not to Mary.

00:44:27.390 --> 00:44:29.600 align:middle line:84%
So she has a sense
of the cosmic Mary.

00:44:29.600 --> 00:44:31.765 align:middle line:84%
We hear about the
cosmic Christ, but this

00:44:31.765 --> 00:44:33.223 align:middle line:84%
is the goddess
she's talking about,

00:44:33.223 --> 00:44:35.950 align:middle line:84%
you see, the ground
of all being.

00:44:35.950 --> 00:44:39.160 align:middle line:84%
And it's an amazing
phrase, and she

00:44:39.160 --> 00:44:42.260 align:middle line:84%
wrote a number of
her poems and songs

00:44:42.260 --> 00:44:46.860 align:middle line:84%
to Mary, which she
calls the green shoot.

00:44:46.860 --> 00:44:54.120 align:middle line:84%
She gives Mary a lot of
credit for the greening power.

00:44:54.120 --> 00:44:56.680 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: I was thinking of
Mary in terms of Mother Mary.

00:44:56.680 --> 00:44:58.699 align:middle line:84%
>>FOX: Well, yeah, but
she doesn't-- her Mary is

00:44:58.699 --> 00:44:59.240 align:middle line:90%
cosmological.

00:44:59.240 --> 00:44:59.960 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Is cosmological.

00:44:59.960 --> 00:45:01.001 align:middle line:90%
>>FOX: It's not personal.

00:45:01.001 --> 00:45:03.240 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So Mother
Mary is an extension

00:45:03.240 --> 00:45:04.305 align:middle line:90%
of that in her thinking.

00:45:04.305 --> 00:45:04.860 align:middle line:90%
>>FOX: That's right.

00:45:04.860 --> 00:45:07.360 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And also, I want to
ask you about Mary Magdalene--

00:45:07.360 --> 00:45:11.112 align:middle line:84%
if she ever factored
into any of this.

00:45:11.112 --> 00:45:12.320 align:middle line:90%
>>FOX: I don't remember that.

00:45:12.320 --> 00:45:15.510 align:middle line:84%
She wrote a lot of songs
about Saint Ursula, who

00:45:15.510 --> 00:45:18.880 align:middle line:84%
was a woman who was
raped and murdered

00:45:18.880 --> 00:45:21.720 align:middle line:84%
in the Rhineland
before her time,

00:45:21.720 --> 00:45:25.110 align:middle line:84%
but it was just the word
was getting on her day

00:45:25.110 --> 00:45:27.280 align:middle line:84%
that she and others had
been raped and murdered,

00:45:27.280 --> 00:45:31.260 align:middle line:84%
and so she writes more about
Saint Ursula than anybody.

00:45:31.260 --> 00:45:36.320 align:middle line:84%
So clearly she was furious,
and she was putting it out

00:45:36.320 --> 00:45:39.200 align:middle line:84%
there that we have to
remember the violence that

00:45:39.200 --> 00:45:40.320 align:middle line:90%
has done women.

00:45:40.320 --> 00:45:42.700 align:middle line:84%
So that, too, is
significant, I think--

00:45:42.700 --> 00:45:45.010 align:middle line:84%
that she took up
that cause of Saint

00:45:45.010 --> 00:45:47.260 align:middle line:90%
Ursula and her companions.

00:45:47.260 --> 00:45:50.032 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So let's also
talk about the vision--

00:45:50.032 --> 00:45:51.490 align:middle line:84%
again, this whole
thing, the bounty

00:45:51.490 --> 00:45:53.450 align:middle line:84%
of earth, the
juiciness of life--

00:45:53.450 --> 00:45:57.160 align:middle line:84%
she had apocalyptic visions
about the future of Earth

00:45:57.160 --> 00:46:01.010 align:middle line:84%
that might be wise for us
to pay attention to today.

00:46:01.010 --> 00:46:02.799 align:middle line:90%
So can you talk about that?

00:46:02.799 --> 00:46:03.840 align:middle line:90%
>>FOX: Well, that's true.

00:46:03.840 --> 00:46:05.530 align:middle line:90%
She did.

00:46:05.530 --> 00:46:09.272 align:middle line:84%
She warned that-- she talked
about how the clouds are

00:46:09.272 --> 00:46:11.230 align:middle line:84%
coming, when everything
will be turned to dark,

00:46:11.230 --> 00:46:13.950 align:middle line:84%
and the seeds will
no longer produce,

00:46:13.950 --> 00:46:19.430 align:middle line:84%
and darkness will cover
the land if humans

00:46:19.430 --> 00:46:23.390 align:middle line:84%
don't enter into a
relationship of justice

00:46:23.390 --> 00:46:25.200 align:middle line:90%
with the rest of creation.

00:46:25.200 --> 00:46:27.570 align:middle line:84%
So it was kind of
conditional for her.

00:46:27.570 --> 00:46:30.800 align:middle line:84%
It was a way of getting
people to wake up,

00:46:30.800 --> 00:46:33.450 align:middle line:84%
and of course, that's what
apocalyptic literature is all

00:46:33.450 --> 00:46:33.970 align:middle line:90%
about.

00:46:33.970 --> 00:46:38.760 align:middle line:84%
It is always about--
it's a form of generating

00:46:38.760 --> 00:46:44.450 align:middle line:84%
energy and getting people to
change and be transformed.

00:46:44.450 --> 00:46:47.550 align:middle line:84%
So she definitely
invokes that tradition

00:46:47.550 --> 00:46:50.807 align:middle line:84%
of the apocalyptic, kind
of the scary possibilities.

00:46:50.807 --> 00:46:53.140 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Sounds like she was
getting whiffs of Monsanto

00:46:53.140 --> 00:46:56.385 align:middle line:84%
coming in along in
the future, where

00:46:56.385 --> 00:46:57.742 align:middle line:90%
the seeds no longer produce.

00:46:57.742 --> 00:46:59.450 align:middle line:84%
>>FOX: We don't know
what she was smoking

00:46:59.450 --> 00:47:00.220 align:middle line:90%
or what she was eating.

00:47:00.220 --> 00:47:00.890 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Well, there you go.

00:47:00.890 --> 00:47:03.139 align:middle line:84%
>>FOX: But we do know that
she was digging and finding

00:47:03.139 --> 00:47:05.490 align:middle line:84%
all kinds of herbs and maybe
many kinds of mushrooms.

00:47:05.490 --> 00:47:06.195 align:middle line:90%
What do we know?

00:47:06.195 --> 00:47:07.070 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Absolutely.

00:47:07.070 --> 00:47:08.700 align:middle line:84%
Well, I did interview
another author

00:47:08.700 --> 00:47:11.800 align:middle line:84%
who said that, if you do look
in a lot of her paintings,

00:47:11.800 --> 00:47:14.760 align:middle line:84%
or a number of them,
you'll see the iconography

00:47:14.760 --> 00:47:17.760 align:middle line:84%
of the mushroom, which
appears throughout,

00:47:17.760 --> 00:47:20.340 align:middle line:84%
and that that may
have had something

00:47:20.340 --> 00:47:24.550 align:middle line:84%
to do with some of her
visions, because who knows?

00:47:24.550 --> 00:47:27.010 align:middle line:84%
In Germany, of course,
mushroom gathering

00:47:27.010 --> 00:47:29.757 align:middle line:84%
is a past time that's
been around for millennia.

00:47:29.757 --> 00:47:30.590 align:middle line:90%
>>FOX: That's right.

00:47:30.590 --> 00:47:32.570 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And so she
obviously was familiar

00:47:32.570 --> 00:47:33.740 align:middle line:90%
with various mushrooms.

00:47:33.740 --> 00:47:34.652 align:middle line:90%
>>FOX: Absolutely.

00:47:34.652 --> 00:47:36.360 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So it's not
out of the question

00:47:36.360 --> 00:47:39.200 align:middle line:84%
to think that she may have
come in contact with some

00:47:39.200 --> 00:47:41.883 align:middle line:84%
of these that were more
mind expanding even.

00:47:41.883 --> 00:47:43.633 align:middle line:84%
>>FOX: Right, it's
certainly not something

00:47:43.633 --> 00:47:43.970 align:middle line:90%
that can be disproved.

00:47:43.970 --> 00:47:46.220 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: She was an open
woman, and in fact, Jung

00:47:46.220 --> 00:47:50.470 align:middle line:84%
called her classic
archetype of the wild woman.

00:47:50.470 --> 00:47:51.690 align:middle line:90%
So can we talk about that?

00:47:51.690 --> 00:47:53.398 align:middle line:84%
>>FOX: That's marvelous--
the wild woman.

00:47:53.398 --> 00:47:55.720 align:middle line:84%
Yes, I have a little chapter
in my book on Hildegard,

00:47:55.720 --> 00:47:58.680 align:middle line:84%
putting her in the room with
Clarissa Pinkola Estes, who

00:47:58.680 --> 00:48:00.970 align:middle line:84%
has done, I think,
the archetypal book

00:48:00.970 --> 00:48:04.200 align:middle line:84%
on the wild woman, and the
two of them think alike.

00:48:04.200 --> 00:48:07.680 align:middle line:84%
Again, the wild woman has a
lot to do with creativity.

00:48:07.680 --> 00:48:09.990 align:middle line:84%
She also thunders
after injustice,

00:48:09.990 --> 00:48:13.200 align:middle line:84%
and she feels life in
the gut, not in the head,

00:48:13.200 --> 00:48:15.090 align:middle line:84%
and that's certainly
Hildegard, you see.

00:48:15.090 --> 00:48:16.627 align:middle line:90%
Hildegard is not over educated.

00:48:16.627 --> 00:48:18.460 align:middle line:84%
She's educated, but
she's not over educated.

00:48:18.460 --> 00:48:22.720 align:middle line:84%
She's not running around in
the world of rationality.

00:48:22.720 --> 00:48:25.342 align:middle line:84%
She is paying attention to
intuition and to instincts.

00:48:25.342 --> 00:48:27.550 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: She believed in
the intellect of the heart.

00:48:27.550 --> 00:48:28.450 align:middle line:90%
>>FOX: That's right.

00:48:28.450 --> 00:48:31.300 align:middle line:84%
That's right-- and
the power of instinct,

00:48:31.300 --> 00:48:33.720 align:middle line:84%
and again, this is part
of a shamanistic side,

00:48:33.720 --> 00:48:37.970 align:middle line:84%
too, I think-- that
the shaman, too,

00:48:37.970 --> 00:48:40.050 align:middle line:84%
puts us in touch
with the animals,

00:48:40.050 --> 00:48:42.180 align:middle line:84%
and the animal instincts
that are in all of us,

00:48:42.180 --> 00:48:46.070 align:middle line:84%
but then are also in
nature, and she talks a lot.

00:48:46.070 --> 00:48:48.070 align:middle line:84%
She paints-- you'll see
so many of her paintings

00:48:48.070 --> 00:48:49.720 align:middle line:90%
have animals in them.

00:48:49.720 --> 00:48:53.280 align:middle line:84%
And also her teaching
about healing-- she

00:48:53.280 --> 00:48:56.720 align:middle line:84%
brings in the animals,
as well, and what

00:48:56.720 --> 00:49:02.490 align:middle line:84%
they have to help us with
psychologically and emotionally

00:49:02.490 --> 00:49:04.140 align:middle line:90%
and sometimes physically.

00:49:04.140 --> 00:49:09.030 align:middle line:84%
So again, she's so
immersed in the breadth

00:49:09.030 --> 00:49:11.955 align:middle line:84%
and diversity and
wealth of nature itself.

00:49:11.955 --> 00:49:14.660 align:middle line:84%
That is where she
draws her energy,

00:49:14.660 --> 00:49:19.260 align:middle line:84%
and one very important
thinker, Thomas Berry,

00:49:19.260 --> 00:49:22.110 align:middle line:84%
says that her
mysticism is unique

00:49:22.110 --> 00:49:26.950 align:middle line:84%
because it's so nature--
it's nature based eroticism.

00:49:26.950 --> 00:49:29.367 align:middle line:84%
He says the nearest
thing to it is paganism--

00:49:29.367 --> 00:49:30.200 align:middle line:90%
that she's a pagan--

00:49:30.200 --> 00:49:31.574 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: That's
why I brought up

00:49:31.574 --> 00:49:33.820 align:middle line:84%
the whole notion of the
druidism to begin with, yes.

00:49:33.820 --> 00:49:35.990 align:middle line:84%
>>FOX: She's really a
pagan Christian mystic.

00:49:35.990 --> 00:49:37.136 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes, absolutely.

00:49:37.136 --> 00:49:38.427 align:middle line:90%
>>FOX: And this is interesting.

00:49:38.427 --> 00:49:42.680 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Yes, that's where
you perk a lot of us up.

00:49:42.680 --> 00:49:45.700 align:middle line:84%
And I have one more thing I want
to bring up before we find out

00:49:45.700 --> 00:49:48.280 align:middle line:84%
how her life wound
down and such,

00:49:48.280 --> 00:49:52.030 align:middle line:84%
and she said Adam's fall from
grace in the Garden of Eden

00:49:52.030 --> 00:49:55.240 align:middle line:84%
was a sin of omission,
not commission.

00:49:55.240 --> 00:49:58.510 align:middle line:84%
And this goes back to the
original topic of original sin,

00:49:58.510 --> 00:50:00.320 align:middle line:90%
so what did she mean by that?

00:50:00.320 --> 00:50:02.280 align:middle line:84%
>>FOX: Yeah, it's a very
interesting teaching.

00:50:02.280 --> 00:50:04.470 align:middle line:84%
I've not seen it
any other theologia.

00:50:04.470 --> 00:50:08.360 align:middle line:84%
She says that Adam only
sniffed the flowers.

00:50:08.360 --> 00:50:11.470 align:middle line:84%
If he had spent more time
taking in the complete beauty

00:50:11.470 --> 00:50:15.470 align:middle line:84%
of the flowers, he wouldn't
have fallen out of grace

00:50:15.470 --> 00:50:18.740 align:middle line:84%
because when you
only sniff at life,

00:50:18.740 --> 00:50:21.340 align:middle line:84%
you're always looking for
something more, you see.

00:50:21.340 --> 00:50:22.300 align:middle line:90%
So you go into greed.

00:50:22.300 --> 00:50:23.140 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: The sin of omission.

00:50:23.140 --> 00:50:24.910 align:middle line:84%
>>FOX: And so it was
a sin of omission.

00:50:24.910 --> 00:50:29.320 align:middle line:84%
He did not drink deeply
enough of the beauty of life.

00:50:29.320 --> 00:50:31.777 align:middle line:84%
It's a very stunning and
significant teaching.

00:50:31.777 --> 00:50:32.610 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Beautiful.

00:50:32.610 --> 00:50:35.040 align:middle line:84%
>>FOX: It's at the heart, I
think, again, of all greed.

00:50:35.040 --> 00:50:39.010 align:middle line:84%
I think consumer capitalism
only sniffs at life, you see.

00:50:39.010 --> 00:50:41.640 align:middle line:84%
It doesn't find the real
beauty and the real joy

00:50:41.640 --> 00:50:46.510 align:middle line:84%
within things and within
oneself, and so it sets us up.

00:50:46.510 --> 00:50:48.320 align:middle line:84%
I believe that
consumer capitalism

00:50:48.320 --> 00:50:51.075 align:middle line:84%
is built on an ideology
of original sin

00:50:51.075 --> 00:50:52.700 align:middle line:84%
because they're really
saying you don't

00:50:52.700 --> 00:50:54.140 align:middle line:90%
have what it takes inside you.

00:50:54.140 --> 00:50:57.360 align:middle line:84%
You have to go outside for
salvation, buy something.

00:50:57.360 --> 00:51:01.530 align:middle line:84%
Hildegard says everything
that's necessary

00:51:01.530 --> 00:51:03.860 align:middle line:90%
for life is within us.

00:51:03.860 --> 00:51:06.410 align:middle line:84%
That's powerful
teaching, and that to me,

00:51:06.410 --> 00:51:08.840 align:middle line:84%
is an affront to
consumer capitalism.

00:51:08.840 --> 00:51:09.800 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Absolutely.

00:51:09.800 --> 00:51:12.220 align:middle line:84%
She is an absolute
woman for our times.

00:51:12.220 --> 00:51:14.340 align:middle line:84%
I think everybody that's
watching this right now

00:51:14.340 --> 00:51:16.590 align:middle line:84%
is going-- they're going to
be looking for your books,

00:51:16.590 --> 00:51:19.300 align:middle line:84%
and online, and searching, and
looking for the documentary,

00:51:19.300 --> 00:51:22.619 align:middle line:90%
but let's talk about why now?

00:51:22.619 --> 00:51:24.160 align:middle line:84%
What happened to
her all these years?

00:51:24.160 --> 00:51:26.390 align:middle line:90%
She went into total obscurity.

00:51:26.390 --> 00:51:30.610 align:middle line:84%
>>FOX: She did, and I think
there are many reasons for it.

00:51:30.610 --> 00:51:34.530 align:middle line:84%
One is, of course,
patriarchy took over again,

00:51:34.530 --> 00:51:42.220 align:middle line:84%
and they consider her crazy
but thanks to her sisters--

00:51:42.220 --> 00:51:44.530 align:middle line:84%
her Benedictine sisters
preserved everything--

00:51:44.530 --> 00:51:45.360 align:middle line:90%
all her letters, all her books.

00:51:45.360 --> 00:51:46.693 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: All through the years.

00:51:46.693 --> 00:51:47.700 align:middle line:90%
>>FOX: For 800 years.

00:51:47.700 --> 00:51:49.597 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: 800 years
they protected her work.

00:51:49.597 --> 00:51:50.680 align:middle line:90%
>>FOX: Protected her work.

00:51:50.680 --> 00:51:51.430 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Amazing.

00:51:51.430 --> 00:51:53.970 align:middle line:84%
>>FOX: And in 1945, when the
American bombers were coming

00:51:53.970 --> 00:51:56.390 align:middle line:84%
near Bingen, they
packed everything up,

00:51:56.390 --> 00:51:59.599 align:middle line:84%
but wisely they photocopied
everything first.

00:51:59.599 --> 00:52:00.640 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Thank goodness.

00:52:00.640 --> 00:52:03.550 align:middle line:84%
>>FOX: They packed it all up
to take it to a safe place.

00:52:03.550 --> 00:52:07.170 align:middle line:84%
That safe place they chose
was Dresden, which means,

00:52:07.170 --> 00:52:08.840 align:middle line:84%
of course, they
were all destroyed,

00:52:08.840 --> 00:52:10.704 align:middle line:84%
but we have a copy
of everything.

00:52:10.704 --> 00:52:11.620 align:middle line:90%
First generation copy.

00:52:11.620 --> 00:52:11.970 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Thank God.

00:52:11.970 --> 00:52:12.530 align:middle line:90%
>>FOX: Thank God.

00:52:12.530 --> 00:52:12.855 align:middle line:90%
Thank the sisters.

00:52:12.855 --> 00:52:13.490 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Isn't that amazing?

00:52:13.490 --> 00:52:15.550 align:middle line:84%
>>FOX: But it raised
a question in my mind.

00:52:15.550 --> 00:52:19.240 align:middle line:84%
Hildegard had these sisters
for 800 years to support her.

00:52:19.240 --> 00:52:21.470 align:middle line:84%
How many other women
did great things?

00:52:21.470 --> 00:52:25.450 align:middle line:10%
They didn't have a sisterhood
of 800 to preserve them.

00:52:25.450 --> 00:52:28.340 align:middle line:10%
How much else has been lost
that women have accomplished

00:52:28.340 --> 00:52:29.570 align:middle line:10%
over the centuries?

00:52:29.570 --> 00:52:31.780 align:middle line:10%
At least we have this
one Renaissance woman

00:52:31.780 --> 00:52:36.320 align:middle line:10%
with all of her richness
to inspire us today,

00:52:36.320 --> 00:52:37.640 align:middle line:10%
but it's very sad.

00:52:37.640 --> 00:52:38.910 align:middle line:90%
It raises questions.

00:52:38.910 --> 00:52:41.140 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: It is
sad, but thank you

00:52:41.140 --> 00:52:45.160 align:middle line:84%
for taking the time to
document her life so thoroughly

00:52:45.160 --> 00:52:48.612 align:middle line:84%
and for being out there
sharing the wisdom she had,

00:52:48.612 --> 00:52:51.070 align:middle line:84%
and we're going to have a second
conversation because we're

00:52:51.070 --> 00:52:54.030 align:middle line:84%
going to have kind of knocked
on effect of Hildegard

00:52:54.030 --> 00:52:55.990 align:middle line:90%
in the next conversation.

00:52:55.990 --> 00:52:57.010 align:middle line:90%
Thank you so much.

00:52:57.010 --> 00:52:58.010 align:middle line:90%
>>FOX: Thank you.

00:52:58.010 --> 00:53:00.240 align:middle line:10%
>>REGINA: Dr. Fox has
written over 30 books, which

00:53:00.240 --> 00:53:01.860 align:middle line:10%
you can find in
the usual places,

00:53:01.860 --> 00:53:03.450 align:middle line:10%
and in our next
conversation, we'll

00:53:03.450 --> 00:53:05.990 align:middle line:10%
speak about an equally
prescient and profound Catholic

00:53:05.990 --> 00:53:10.160 align:middle line:10%
mystic, Meister Eckhart, not to
be confused with Eckhart Tolle.

00:53:10.160 --> 00:53:13.690 align:middle line:84%
Until next time, thank you for
joining us here on Gaiam TV.
