00:00:24.450 --> 00:00:27.330 align:middle line:10%
is going to share with us today
in the face of a great deal

00:00:27.330 --> 00:00:29.310 align:middle line:10%
of suffering in the year 2020.

useful information.

would be optional.

where you've explained a bit
about where your interests were

even as a young man,
some of the experiences

00:01:19.320 --> 00:01:20.340 align:middle line:90%
you were experiencing.

Let's just go ahead and kind
of give them a little glimpse

00:01:22.920 --> 00:01:26.230 align:middle line:84%
into young Bill, or Billy,
or whomever you were then.

00:01:27.030 --> 00:01:28.350 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Were you
Billy or were you--

00:01:28.350 --> 00:01:28.860 align:middle line:90%
>>MCKENNA: I was Billy.

00:01:28.860 --> 00:01:29.550 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: You were Billy.

00:01:29.550 --> 00:01:30.000 align:middle line:90%
I thought so.

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:30.630 align:middle line:84%
>>MCKENNA: Yeah,
I was Billy, yeah.

00:01:30.630 --> 00:01:32.755 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So let's talk
about what little Billy was

00:01:32.755 --> 00:01:35.010 align:middle line:84%
like that created the Bill
today because you saw life

00:01:35.010 --> 00:01:37.320 align:middle line:90%
differently from an early age.

00:01:37.320 --> 00:01:38.670 align:middle line:90%
>>MCKENNA: Yeah.

00:01:38.670 --> 00:01:43.980 align:middle line:84%
My perception was that I had a
traditional Irish upbringing--

00:01:43.980 --> 00:01:46.410 align:middle line:84%
mental illness, alcoholism,
those sorts of--

00:01:46.410 --> 00:01:48.440 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Just like my
family lineage, grandpa.

00:01:48.440 --> 00:01:48.720 align:middle line:90%
>>MCKENNA: Right.

00:01:48.720 --> 00:01:50.040 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Arthur Lenahan.

00:01:50.040 --> 00:01:50.970 align:middle line:90%
>>MCKENNA: Right.

00:01:50.970 --> 00:01:59.970 align:middle line:84%
So that upbringing kind
of shaped my reality.

00:01:59.970 --> 00:02:01.980 align:middle line:90%
And it was merely a perception.

00:02:01.980 --> 00:02:08.100 align:middle line:84%
But ultimately it led me
to forgive everything,

00:02:08.100 --> 00:02:10.930 align:middle line:84%
and that was the
beginning of my awakening.

00:02:10.930 --> 00:02:11.730 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:02:11.730 --> 00:02:14.130 align:middle line:84%
>>MCKENNA: From there,
all kinds of other things

00:02:14.130 --> 00:02:15.250 align:middle line:90%
started happening.

00:02:15.250 --> 00:02:16.050 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:02:16.050 --> 00:02:18.930 align:middle line:84%
Well, you have this kind
of overwhelming kind

00:02:18.930 --> 00:02:22.590 align:middle line:84%
of puppy level of enthusiasm
that most people, I'm sure,

00:02:22.590 --> 00:02:24.630 align:middle line:90%
admire if not envy.

00:02:24.630 --> 00:02:27.930 align:middle line:84%
How do you wake up so
kind of charged, just

00:02:27.930 --> 00:02:30.900 align:middle line:84%
having this natural amount of
energy running through you?

00:02:30.900 --> 00:02:33.930 align:middle line:84%
And in your case, it
does carry this optimism

00:02:33.930 --> 00:02:38.070 align:middle line:84%
and also that's taking you into
a very proactive phase of life

00:02:38.070 --> 00:02:40.650 align:middle line:90%
in creating the Cognomovement.

00:02:40.650 --> 00:02:42.450 align:middle line:90%
So what is it that fuels you?

00:02:42.450 --> 00:02:44.010 align:middle line:84%
Everyone has a fuel
that charges you

00:02:44.010 --> 00:02:46.260 align:middle line:84%
to get up in the morning
with all this energy.

00:02:46.260 --> 00:02:47.130 align:middle line:90%
>>MCKENNA: Oh, gosh.

00:02:47.130 --> 00:02:50.540 align:middle line:84%
Well, now, really, it's all
about service to others.

00:02:50.540 --> 00:02:51.570 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:02:51.570 --> 00:02:53.460 align:middle line:90%
>>MCKENNA: I can't help it.

00:02:53.460 --> 00:02:57.600 align:middle line:84%
I went from service 100% to
self to now service to others.

00:02:57.600 --> 00:03:00.340 align:middle line:90%
And it's just, I can't help it.

00:03:00.340 --> 00:03:04.560 align:middle line:84%
And so I get a lot
of ideas and concepts

00:03:04.560 --> 00:03:09.390 align:middle line:84%
and things that actually
can help a person to process

00:03:09.390 --> 00:03:13.440 align:middle line:84%
events of life, help them to
physically perform better,

00:03:13.440 --> 00:03:15.160 align:middle line:90%
all kinds of different things.

00:03:15.160 --> 00:03:17.550 align:middle line:84%
And I had wonderful
teachers along the way

00:03:17.550 --> 00:03:18.960 align:middle line:90%
that kind of helped me.

00:03:18.960 --> 00:03:21.630 align:middle line:84%
I stand on the
shoulders of giants.

00:03:21.630 --> 00:03:23.790 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Yes, and I just
want to insert something.

00:03:23.790 --> 00:03:24.730 align:middle line:90%
This is a total--

00:03:24.730 --> 00:03:27.120 align:middle line:84%
it's not exactly a non
sequitur, but it just

00:03:27.120 --> 00:03:28.680 align:middle line:90%
popped into my mind to say this.

00:03:28.680 --> 00:03:32.760 align:middle line:84%
What you just said, that now
you wake up with this enthusiasm

00:03:32.760 --> 00:03:35.843 align:middle line:84%
because your desire is to
be of service to others.

00:03:35.843 --> 00:03:38.010 align:middle line:84%
And this is one thing I've
noted throughout my life.

00:03:38.010 --> 00:03:40.620 align:middle line:84%
And I've meant to bring it up
in a couple other interviews

00:03:40.620 --> 00:03:42.312 align:middle line:90%
it was tickling my mind.

00:03:42.312 --> 00:03:43.770 align:middle line:84%
And that is during
a time where you

00:03:43.770 --> 00:03:45.955 align:middle line:84%
have such great
stress, sometimes

00:03:45.955 --> 00:03:47.580 align:middle line:84%
you just don't have
it figured out yet.

00:03:47.580 --> 00:03:49.320 align:middle line:84%
You haven't touched
on your truth,

00:03:49.320 --> 00:03:51.070 align:middle line:90%
how you fit into all of this.

00:03:51.070 --> 00:03:52.650 align:middle line:84%
But the one thing
I've found in life

00:03:52.650 --> 00:03:56.010 align:middle line:84%
that transcends all of that
is if there's something

00:03:56.010 --> 00:03:59.280 align:middle line:84%
you can do for someone else,
just anything you can do

00:03:59.280 --> 00:04:02.490 align:middle line:84%
for someone else to make them
a little more comfortable,

00:04:02.490 --> 00:04:04.200 align:middle line:84%
to bring a smile
to someone's face,

00:04:04.200 --> 00:04:06.570 align:middle line:84%
just to spoil them
even a little bit,

00:04:06.570 --> 00:04:09.870 align:middle line:84%
immediately I find
energy moves upward

00:04:09.870 --> 00:04:12.750 align:middle line:84%
once we choose to dedicate
something in ourselves

00:04:12.750 --> 00:04:14.002 align:middle line:90%
to something in someone else.

00:04:14.002 --> 00:04:15.210 align:middle line:90%
>>MCKENNA: Yeah, that's true.

00:04:15.210 --> 00:04:15.930 align:middle line:90%
That's true.

00:04:15.930 --> 00:04:17.350 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And we
can all do that.

00:04:17.350 --> 00:04:20.130 align:middle line:84%
And that's a way to
immediately shift energy.

00:04:20.130 --> 00:04:21.029 align:middle line:90%
>>MCKENNA: It is.

00:04:21.029 --> 00:04:21.829 align:middle line:90%
It is.

00:04:21.829 --> 00:04:24.160 align:middle line:84%
And most people,
it's not available.

00:04:24.160 --> 00:04:25.890 align:middle line:90%
And the reason it's not--

00:04:25.890 --> 00:04:26.850 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: What do you
mean it's not available?

00:04:26.850 --> 00:04:29.267 align:middle line:84%
>>MCKENNA: Not available because
there's part of them that

00:04:29.267 --> 00:04:31.200 align:middle line:90%
has not been healed yet.

00:04:31.200 --> 00:04:35.730 align:middle line:84%
They're overcome in shame,
humiliation, guilt, grief.

00:04:35.730 --> 00:04:38.760 align:middle line:84%
They have kind of
obsessive loops going on.

00:04:38.760 --> 00:04:41.160 align:middle line:84%
Almost anybody that
you meet, there's

00:04:41.160 --> 00:04:45.550 align:middle line:84%
a war going on inside of them
that we know nothing about.

00:04:45.550 --> 00:04:49.230 align:middle line:84%
And so one of the
things that I've done

00:04:49.230 --> 00:04:53.260 align:middle line:84%
is to help people
to break the loops.

00:04:53.260 --> 00:04:54.060 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:04:54.060 --> 00:04:54.860 align:middle line:90%
Yeah, you have.

00:04:54.860 --> 00:04:57.960 align:middle line:84%
>>MCKENNA: So that once
they've broken the loop,

00:04:57.960 --> 00:05:01.470 align:middle line:84%
whole new perceptions now
emerge, and they can actually

00:05:01.470 --> 00:05:02.850 align:middle line:90%
start being of service.

00:05:02.850 --> 00:05:05.160 align:middle line:84%
They can see a
broader perspective.

00:05:05.160 --> 00:05:09.180 align:middle line:84%
Not only can they see a broader
perspective intellectually,

00:05:09.180 --> 00:05:11.190 align:middle line:84%
but actually with
their peripheral vision

00:05:11.190 --> 00:05:12.640 align:middle line:90%
as well, literally.

00:05:12.640 --> 00:05:14.160 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: No, that is true.

00:05:14.160 --> 00:05:16.470 align:middle line:84%
And I don't know this
because, like you say,

00:05:16.470 --> 00:05:18.553 align:middle line:84%
every person is wired
so uniquely differently.

00:05:18.553 --> 00:05:20.470 align:middle line:84%
And we're going to get
into the nature of that

00:05:20.470 --> 00:05:23.020 align:middle line:84%
because it really involves
the subconscious mind

00:05:23.020 --> 00:05:28.030 align:middle line:84%
and what we carry around by way
of perception and experience.

00:05:28.030 --> 00:05:31.420 align:middle line:84%
But would you say in working
with people in general

00:05:31.420 --> 00:05:35.410 align:middle line:84%
that most people live in
a fair amount of fear?

00:05:35.410 --> 00:05:38.380 align:middle line:84%
>>MCKENNA: Almost
everybody, almost everybody

00:05:38.380 --> 00:05:43.120 align:middle line:84%
lives in an incredible amount
of fear, but it's disguised.

00:05:43.120 --> 00:05:45.610 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So what does
fear look like in disguise?

00:05:45.610 --> 00:05:46.000 align:middle line:90%
>>MCKENNA: Oh, fear--

00:05:46.000 --> 00:05:47.167 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: The masks of fear.

00:05:47.167 --> 00:05:52.360 align:middle line:84%
>>MCKENNA: The masks of fear are
really shame and humiliation.

00:05:52.360 --> 00:05:56.620 align:middle line:84%
Or fear will show
itself as anxiety.

00:05:56.620 --> 00:05:59.800 align:middle line:90%
Fear will show itself as grief.

00:05:59.800 --> 00:06:03.200 align:middle line:84%
It shows itself as all
kinds of different things.

00:06:03.200 --> 00:06:05.530 align:middle line:90%
It shows itself as resentment.

00:06:05.530 --> 00:06:08.020 align:middle line:90%
It shows itself as blame.

00:06:08.020 --> 00:06:10.030 align:middle line:90%
So it's everywhere.

00:06:10.030 --> 00:06:13.960 align:middle line:84%
And people are expressing
it just in different ways.

00:06:13.960 --> 00:06:18.340 align:middle line:84%
Most of all, people
are experiencing it

00:06:18.340 --> 00:06:19.930 align:middle line:90%
as a drain of energy.

00:06:19.930 --> 00:06:24.220 align:middle line:84%
Literally as we get
older, over time

00:06:24.220 --> 00:06:28.810 align:middle line:84%
we find that we have less energy
because we have experiences

00:06:28.810 --> 00:06:32.590 align:middle line:84%
that pile up, one
after the next,

00:06:32.590 --> 00:06:38.420 align:middle line:84%
like a betrayal, a
death of a loved one,

00:06:38.420 --> 00:06:41.350 align:middle line:84%
a feeling of an
insult by somebody.

00:06:41.350 --> 00:06:45.550 align:middle line:84%
And we loop through thoughts,
a feeling and a thought.

00:06:45.550 --> 00:06:49.930 align:middle line:84%
And what ends up happening
is that these things

00:06:49.930 --> 00:06:53.380 align:middle line:84%
slowly and bit by
bit drain our energy.

00:06:53.380 --> 00:06:56.920 align:middle line:84%
And now, which we'll get into,
we can actually prove it.

00:06:56.920 --> 00:06:59.870 align:middle line:84%
And we can prove it through
the Bio-Well system.

00:06:59.870 --> 00:07:00.670 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:07:00.670 --> 00:07:02.450 align:middle line:84%
And that is a very
good point you make.

00:07:02.450 --> 00:07:04.600 align:middle line:84%
Now, I'm going to turn
this into a somewhat

00:07:04.600 --> 00:07:07.810 align:middle line:84%
of a personal conversation
because I was born

00:07:07.810 --> 00:07:10.420 align:middle line:84%
configured in a certain way
where my body doesn't create

00:07:10.420 --> 00:07:14.260 align:middle line:84%
natural cortisol, which is your
defense to everything, right?

00:07:14.260 --> 00:07:19.120 align:middle line:84%
And so one thing that triggers
cortisol in our bodies

00:07:19.120 --> 00:07:22.210 align:middle line:90%
faster than anything is fear.

00:07:22.210 --> 00:07:25.060 align:middle line:84%
And so I'm like a
canary in the coal mine.

00:07:25.060 --> 00:07:27.850 align:middle line:84%
If I go into fear,
I start tanking,

00:07:27.850 --> 00:07:30.380 align:middle line:84%
and that can become
a very serious issue.

00:07:30.380 --> 00:07:32.230 align:middle line:84%
It's not just a
little bit of a drain.

00:07:32.230 --> 00:07:34.060 align:middle line:84%
But because I'm so
sensitively wired

00:07:34.060 --> 00:07:37.780 align:middle line:84%
and don't have that infusion
of cortisol to come in

00:07:37.780 --> 00:07:40.810 align:middle line:84%
and to keep your
vitals going and stem

00:07:40.810 --> 00:07:44.020 align:middle line:84%
the whatever the
situation at hand is,

00:07:44.020 --> 00:07:48.970 align:middle line:84%
I can see just how
incredibly dramatically fear

00:07:48.970 --> 00:07:50.050 align:middle line:90%
drains the human body.

00:07:50.050 --> 00:07:52.240 align:middle line:84%
To me, going into
fear is the difference

00:07:52.240 --> 00:07:55.045 align:middle line:84%
between ending up in the ER
or not ending up in an ER,

00:07:55.045 --> 00:07:55.845 align:middle line:90%
for example.

00:07:55.845 --> 00:07:56.430 align:middle line:90%
>>MCKENNA: Wow.

00:07:56.430 --> 00:07:57.230 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:07:57.230 --> 00:07:59.650 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So I'm looking
at it at large thinking,

00:07:59.650 --> 00:08:03.010 align:middle line:84%
humanity is going around
like this responding

00:08:03.010 --> 00:08:05.110 align:middle line:90%
to fear all the time.

00:08:05.110 --> 00:08:08.530 align:middle line:84%
They just don't have that
sense, that physical strange

00:08:08.530 --> 00:08:10.930 align:middle line:84%
sensitivity that's going
to put them in the ER.

00:08:10.930 --> 00:08:14.320 align:middle line:84%
But it's draining them
nonetheless unconsciously

00:08:14.320 --> 00:08:15.790 align:middle line:90%
all day, every day.

00:08:15.790 --> 00:08:19.570 align:middle line:84%
I can't afford to stay in fear
because it's so consequential.

00:08:19.570 --> 00:08:21.370 align:middle line:84%
But I see it all
the time in people,

00:08:21.370 --> 00:08:24.560 align:middle line:84%
and I understand how it happens,
but you're not aware of it.

00:08:24.560 --> 00:08:28.600 align:middle line:84%
You're just a little more
tired, a little less shiny

00:08:28.600 --> 00:08:32.539 align:middle line:84%
as the days, weeks, years go
on if you don't address it.

00:08:32.539 --> 00:08:33.460 align:middle line:90%
>>MCKENNA: It's true.

00:08:33.460 --> 00:08:35.440 align:middle line:84%
If you look at it,
like when you were

00:08:35.440 --> 00:08:39.197 align:middle line:84%
a teenager, all your creativity,
all of your physical energy--

00:08:39.197 --> 00:08:40.780 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So excited
about everything.

00:08:40.780 --> 00:08:41.260 align:middle line:90%
>>MCKENNA: Right?

00:08:41.260 --> 00:08:42.060 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:08:42.060 --> 00:08:47.500 align:middle line:84%
>>MCKENNA: And then as you watch
people age, most people dull.

00:08:47.500 --> 00:08:49.990 align:middle line:84%
Everything about them dulls,
and they have lower energy.

00:08:49.990 --> 00:08:51.360 align:middle line:90%
They walk slower, talk slower.

00:08:51.360 --> 00:08:52.160 align:middle line:90%
Everything--

00:08:52.160 --> 00:08:52.450 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Stoop.

00:08:52.450 --> 00:08:54.070 align:middle line:90%
Their shoulders start stooping.

00:08:54.070 --> 00:08:55.360 align:middle line:90%
This is a big one.

00:08:55.360 --> 00:08:56.290 align:middle line:90%
That's my thing.

00:08:56.290 --> 00:08:57.770 align:middle line:90%
I tell people, hey, stand up.

00:08:57.770 --> 00:08:58.570 align:middle line:90%
Stand up straight.

00:08:58.570 --> 00:08:59.620 align:middle line:90%
Get your shoulders back.

00:08:59.620 --> 00:09:00.070 align:middle line:90%
>>MCKENNA: That's right.

00:09:00.070 --> 00:09:02.070 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So you can feel
your own energy again.

00:09:02.070 --> 00:09:03.040 align:middle line:90%
>>MCKENNA: You bet.

00:09:03.040 --> 00:09:07.540 align:middle line:84%
And so when we
clear the situation,

00:09:07.540 --> 00:09:12.630 align:middle line:84%
let's say we start to clear the
guilt, the grief, the blame,

00:09:12.630 --> 00:09:15.670 align:middle line:84%
the things that are sitting
out there for people.

00:09:15.670 --> 00:09:18.550 align:middle line:84%
What happens is they
get their energy back.

00:09:18.550 --> 00:09:22.660 align:middle line:84%
They literally go
from 14 hours of sleep

00:09:22.660 --> 00:09:25.750 align:middle line:90%
now to seven hours of sleep.

00:09:25.750 --> 00:09:29.290 align:middle line:84%
They have energy to
create new things.

00:09:29.290 --> 00:09:31.600 align:middle line:90%
I had this wonderful story.

00:09:31.600 --> 00:09:36.670 align:middle line:84%
It was a woman who came in, and
she was a doctor, financially

00:09:36.670 --> 00:09:37.630 align:middle line:90%
stressed.

00:09:37.630 --> 00:09:39.030 align:middle line:90%
And it was layered.

00:09:39.030 --> 00:09:41.650 align:middle line:84%
I worked with her
with Cognomovement,

00:09:41.650 --> 00:09:46.450 align:middle line:84%
and we cleared this
feeling of stress.

00:09:46.450 --> 00:09:48.400 align:middle line:90%
Amazing thing happened.

00:09:48.400 --> 00:09:52.720 align:middle line:90%
With that week-- this is Sunday.

00:09:52.720 --> 00:09:56.320 align:middle line:84%
On Monday, she gets a
phone call from her mother.

00:09:56.320 --> 00:10:02.110 align:middle line:84%
40 years-- 40 years, her mother
never apologized for squat,

00:10:02.110 --> 00:10:04.350 align:middle line:90%
just did what she did.

00:10:04.350 --> 00:10:06.100 align:middle line:84%
And all of a sudden
Monday, she's calling.

00:10:06.100 --> 00:10:07.450 align:middle line:90%
Hey, you know what?

00:10:07.450 --> 00:10:08.440 align:middle line:90%
I admit it.

00:10:08.440 --> 00:10:09.475 align:middle line:90%
I admit it.

00:10:09.475 --> 00:10:10.360 align:middle line:90%
Admit it.

00:10:10.360 --> 00:10:13.010 align:middle line:90%
And I want to apologize.

00:10:13.010 --> 00:10:15.010 align:middle line:90%
And I want to restart.

00:10:15.010 --> 00:10:18.945 align:middle line:84%
And it was the birth of their
relationship at 40 years.

00:10:18.945 --> 00:10:20.010 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Oh, wow.

00:10:20.010 --> 00:10:21.500 align:middle line:90%
>>MCKENNA: And not only that--

00:10:21.500 --> 00:10:24.890 align:middle line:84%
not only that, but she
goes on that week--

00:10:24.890 --> 00:10:28.470 align:middle line:84%
that week, less
than one week later,

00:10:28.470 --> 00:10:30.210 align:middle line:90%
she produced this painting.

00:10:30.210 --> 00:10:32.930 align:middle line:84%
And this painting she did
in a medium she never did.

00:10:32.930 --> 00:10:33.980 align:middle line:90%
It's a flower.

00:10:33.980 --> 00:10:36.050 align:middle line:90%
It has beautiful colors.

00:10:36.050 --> 00:10:39.290 align:middle line:84%
And she never painted
the subject matter.

00:10:39.290 --> 00:10:42.468 align:middle line:84%
She figured out a mathematical
formula to paint it.

00:10:42.468 --> 00:10:44.510 align:middle line:84%
Mathematical formula-- I
never even thought about

00:10:44.510 --> 00:10:45.140 align:middle line:84%
a mathematical
formula for painting--

00:10:45.140 --> 00:10:45.610 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Oh, sure,
with flowers, sure.

00:10:45.610 --> 00:10:48.140 align:middle line:84%
>>MCKENNA: --because I'm
not an artist like that.

00:10:48.140 --> 00:10:51.440 align:middle line:84%
But anyway, there's so
many stories that I'll

00:10:51.440 --> 00:10:52.640 align:middle line:90%
tell some more about that.

00:10:52.640 --> 00:10:53.980 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Oh, no, I love that.

00:10:53.980 --> 00:10:57.170 align:middle line:84%
OK, I think it's time we start
digging into the nature of mind

00:10:57.170 --> 00:10:59.840 align:middle line:84%
because this is really
where we're hung up.

00:10:59.840 --> 00:11:01.970 align:middle line:90%
It's at that mental level.

00:11:01.970 --> 00:11:03.080 align:middle line:90%
Events happen.

00:11:03.080 --> 00:11:04.280 align:middle line:90%
We react emotionally.

00:11:04.280 --> 00:11:06.920 align:middle line:84%
It gets stuffed into one
of these compartments,

00:11:06.920 --> 00:11:09.770 align:middle line:84%
and there we stay, getting a
little duller with each year

00:11:09.770 --> 00:11:12.020 align:middle line:90%
as more stuff gets stuck there.

00:11:12.020 --> 00:11:14.990 align:middle line:84%
So in reality, we're
only working with

00:11:14.990 --> 00:11:18.740 align:middle line:84%
and aware of about 5% of
our reality through what

00:11:18.740 --> 00:11:21.710 align:middle line:84%
we call the conscious mind,
which is quite a misnomer,

00:11:21.710 --> 00:11:24.130 align:middle line:84%
in my opinion, but with
the conscious mind.

00:11:24.130 --> 00:11:28.100 align:middle line:84%
But 95% of the rest of it
is really being run out

00:11:28.100 --> 00:11:29.957 align:middle line:90%
of the subconscious mind.

00:11:29.957 --> 00:11:31.040 align:middle line:90%
>>MCKENNA: That's correct.

00:11:31.040 --> 00:11:34.700 align:middle line:84%
And what we do
here is, as humans,

00:11:34.700 --> 00:11:39.380 align:middle line:84%
we fight our subconscious
and our feelings

00:11:39.380 --> 00:11:40.730 align:middle line:90%
with our conscious mind.

00:11:40.730 --> 00:11:43.007 align:middle line:90%
It's an unfair battle.

00:11:43.007 --> 00:11:44.090 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: It's unwinnable.

00:11:44.090 --> 00:11:45.530 align:middle line:90%
>>MCKENNA: It's unwinnable.

00:11:45.530 --> 00:11:49.970 align:middle line:84%
So we're sitting there
doing meditations,

00:11:49.970 --> 00:11:53.990 align:middle line:84%
and we're doing mantras
and affirmations,

00:11:53.990 --> 00:11:57.162 align:middle line:84%
reading books, all kinds of
things that we do, right?

00:11:57.162 --> 00:11:58.120 align:middle line:90%
And I've done them too.

00:11:58.120 --> 00:12:00.890 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: That we can stuff
into that 5% of the mind.

00:12:00.890 --> 00:12:02.660 align:middle line:84%
>>MCKENNA: We're
stuffing it real good,

00:12:02.660 --> 00:12:05.250 align:middle line:84%
and we're really
working really hard.

00:12:05.250 --> 00:12:08.990 align:middle line:84%
So what happens is
people go to the seminar.

00:12:08.990 --> 00:12:11.150 align:middle line:90%
They go to the ashram.

00:12:11.150 --> 00:12:15.225 align:middle line:84%
Ram Dass, wonderful man,
he talks about this.

00:12:15.225 --> 00:12:17.690 align:middle line:84%
You go to the ashram,
and you're high, right?

00:12:17.690 --> 00:12:18.680 align:middle line:90%
You're high.

00:12:18.680 --> 00:12:21.050 align:middle line:84%
You're at love and
bliss and all that.

00:12:21.050 --> 00:12:24.440 align:middle line:84%
And then you come back, and then
you talk to your mom and dad

00:12:24.440 --> 00:12:26.640 align:middle line:90%
and it's like, [DECLINING TONE].

00:12:26.640 --> 00:12:27.440 align:middle line:90%
Right?

00:12:27.440 --> 00:12:29.210 align:middle line:84%
And everybody
witnesses this, right?

00:12:29.210 --> 00:12:30.530 align:middle line:90%
You go to a Tony Robbins deal.

00:12:30.530 --> 00:12:31.863 align:middle line:90%
You're pumped up for-- you know?

00:12:31.863 --> 00:12:33.440 align:middle line:90%
And then [DECLINING TONE].

00:12:33.440 --> 00:12:34.940 align:middle line:90%
You've got keep doing it.

00:12:34.940 --> 00:12:42.680 align:middle line:84%
But the problem is that
what is being not dealt with

00:12:42.680 --> 00:12:44.720 align:middle line:90%
is the feelings in our body.

00:12:44.720 --> 00:12:46.183 align:middle line:90%
So we have--

00:12:46.183 --> 00:12:47.600 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And those
are associated

00:12:47.600 --> 00:12:50.017 align:middle line:84%
with the subconscious, which
we'll talk about in a moment.

00:12:50.017 --> 00:12:51.050 align:middle line:90%
>>MCKENNA: Exactly.

00:12:51.050 --> 00:12:51.890 align:middle line:90%
Exactly.

00:12:51.890 --> 00:12:56.010 align:middle line:84%
So there-- we get these
feelings in our body.

00:12:56.010 --> 00:12:57.980 align:middle line:84%
And then when we
have the feeling,

00:12:57.980 --> 00:12:59.460 align:middle line:90%
we associate a thought with it.

00:12:59.460 --> 00:13:00.260 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:13:00.260 --> 00:13:02.150 align:middle line:84%
>>MCKENNA: And then when
we have the thought,

00:13:02.150 --> 00:13:04.820 align:middle line:90%
it further fuels the feeling.

00:13:04.820 --> 00:13:08.630 align:middle line:84%
So we have these
stored in our body.

00:13:08.630 --> 00:13:12.290 align:middle line:84%
If we don't eliminate
that, then we just

00:13:12.290 --> 00:13:16.950 align:middle line:84%
have this repetitive loop that
just goes on and on and on.

00:13:16.950 --> 00:13:20.990 align:middle line:90%
So this amazing story.

00:13:20.990 --> 00:13:24.050 align:middle line:90%
My mom, 12 kids in our family--

00:13:24.050 --> 00:13:25.100 align:middle line:90%
12 kids.

00:13:25.100 --> 00:13:26.840 align:middle line:90%
We're very Irish, right?

00:13:26.840 --> 00:13:28.010 align:middle line:90%
Irish Catholic.

00:13:28.010 --> 00:13:29.135 align:middle line:90%
So she has 12 kids.

00:13:29.135 --> 00:13:30.743 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Saturday
nights were good.

00:13:30.743 --> 00:13:33.010 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHTER]

00:13:33.010 --> 00:13:34.160 align:middle line:90%
>>MCKENNA: Yeah.

00:13:34.160 --> 00:13:38.180 align:middle line:90%
So there she is, and she signs--

00:13:38.180 --> 00:13:40.632 align:middle line:90%
she wanted to take my course.

00:13:40.632 --> 00:13:42.965 align:middle line:84%
And she's in her 80s, and she
wanted to take the course.

00:13:42.965 --> 00:13:47.150 align:middle line:84%
So, OK, we do like week or month
long courses where the people

00:13:47.150 --> 00:13:49.940 align:middle line:90%
can come several times a week.

00:13:49.940 --> 00:13:53.390 align:middle line:90%
And interesting thing happened.

00:13:53.390 --> 00:13:55.970 align:middle line:84%
And I didn't know
this about my mom.

00:13:55.970 --> 00:14:00.320 align:middle line:84%
It's about a month in, month
and a half in, I can't remember.

00:14:00.320 --> 00:14:06.640 align:middle line:84%
And she pipes up in
the class and she says,

00:14:06.640 --> 00:14:09.940 align:middle line:90%
I don't know what's going on.

00:14:09.940 --> 00:14:13.120 align:middle line:90%
But here I am.

00:14:13.120 --> 00:14:18.280 align:middle line:84%
Every day of my life, I've woke
up with a feeling of dread,

00:14:18.280 --> 00:14:19.870 align:middle line:90%
and it's gone.

00:14:19.870 --> 00:14:22.420 align:middle line:84%
And I feel like
nothing can touch me.

00:14:22.420 --> 00:14:23.610 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: You had 12 kids.

00:14:23.610 --> 00:14:24.410 align:middle line:90%
>>MCKENNA: Yes.

00:14:24.410 --> 00:14:24.760 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:14:24.760 --> 00:14:26.510 align:middle line:84%
>>MCKENNA: Of course
you're feeling dread.

00:14:26.510 --> 00:14:27.440 align:middle line:90%
But now, here she is.

00:14:27.440 --> 00:14:31.840 align:middle line:84%
She's saying, I feel there's
things going on around me,

00:14:31.840 --> 00:14:35.260 align:middle line:90%
but I'm a witness to the events.

00:14:35.260 --> 00:14:38.150 align:middle line:84%
I'm no longer affected
by the events.

00:14:38.150 --> 00:14:38.950 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Wow

00:14:38.950 --> 00:14:42.837 align:middle line:84%
>>MCKENNA: So this
is next-level stuff.

00:14:42.837 --> 00:14:44.920 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: How old was your
mom when this happened?

00:14:44.920 --> 00:14:47.140 align:middle line:84%
>>MCKENNA: Oh, this
was like a week ago.

00:14:47.140 --> 00:14:47.940 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:14:47.940 --> 00:14:49.642 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: OK, so she's up there.

00:14:49.642 --> 00:14:51.100 align:middle line:84%
>>MCKENNA: Oh yeah,
she's up there.

00:14:51.100 --> 00:14:52.300 align:middle line:90%
She's in her 80s.

00:14:52.300 --> 00:14:57.130 align:middle line:84%
And so it gives me great joy
to see her in a situation

00:14:57.130 --> 00:14:59.670 align:middle line:84%
where she's no longer--
she says, I'm not trying,

00:14:59.670 --> 00:15:03.160 align:middle line:84%
and I'm sleeping through the
night, and I wake up happy.

00:15:03.160 --> 00:15:07.720 align:middle line:84%
And I say, well, what
we do in these workshops

00:15:07.720 --> 00:15:10.370 align:middle line:84%
and these seminars is
we go step by step.

00:15:10.370 --> 00:15:13.360 align:middle line:84%
We'll clear out all of
the shame and humiliation,

00:15:13.360 --> 00:15:16.480 align:middle line:84%
or we work on different
subjects, like victimization.

00:15:16.480 --> 00:15:19.960 align:middle line:84%
And they do Cognomovement,
and they feel it.

00:15:19.960 --> 00:15:23.800 align:middle line:84%
It's kind of the opposite
of everything else,

00:15:23.800 --> 00:15:26.260 align:middle line:90%
is to try to vanquish something.

00:15:26.260 --> 00:15:28.360 align:middle line:84%
You actually feel it,
and you do the exercise,

00:15:28.360 --> 00:15:31.570 align:middle line:90%
and your body will actually--

00:15:31.570 --> 00:15:34.170 align:middle line:84%
you can physically feel
it, your body move.

00:15:34.170 --> 00:15:36.860 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Yeah, I've done a
session with you personally.

00:15:36.860 --> 00:15:39.460 align:middle line:84%
And so let's talk about
the mechanics of it

00:15:39.460 --> 00:15:42.430 align:middle line:84%
before we get into the
Cognomovement, then.

00:15:42.430 --> 00:15:45.640 align:middle line:84%
So here we have these
patterns of thoughts

00:15:45.640 --> 00:15:48.910 align:middle line:84%
that are in our head that are
associated and essentially

00:15:48.910 --> 00:15:50.222 align:middle line:90%
in our bodies as well.

00:15:50.222 --> 00:15:51.680 align:middle line:84%
And then you have
the subconscious,

00:15:51.680 --> 00:15:53.310 align:middle line:90%
which permeates all.

00:15:53.310 --> 00:15:55.990 align:middle line:84%
Then you've got the super
conscious or the higher mind,

00:15:55.990 --> 00:15:57.610 align:middle line:90%
soul complex you might call it.

00:15:57.610 --> 00:16:01.750 align:middle line:84%
So you've got the voice,
the higher voice always kind

00:16:01.750 --> 00:16:04.773 align:middle line:84%
of tapping us on the shoulder
trying to let itself be known.

00:16:04.773 --> 00:16:06.190 align:middle line:84%
No, no, no, no,
this isn't what we

00:16:06.190 --> 00:16:07.990 align:middle line:90%
chose to do this time around.

00:16:07.990 --> 00:16:10.262 align:middle line:84%
Let's kind of get over
here and get back on track.

00:16:10.262 --> 00:16:11.720 align:middle line:84%
So you've got that
speaking to you,

00:16:11.720 --> 00:16:15.280 align:middle line:84%
and then you have this 5%
running everything that's

00:16:15.280 --> 00:16:20.170 align:middle line:84%
in control and is not going to
let its little fist unclench.

00:16:20.170 --> 00:16:23.800 align:middle line:84%
And that's re-entrenching
thoughts and feelings

00:16:23.800 --> 00:16:27.430 align:middle line:84%
from the past, which is
the subconscious permeating

00:16:27.430 --> 00:16:29.680 align:middle line:84%
everything, which is
everything we have ever

00:16:29.680 --> 00:16:34.460 align:middle line:84%
experienced that has ever
been this life, other lives.

00:16:34.460 --> 00:16:35.260 align:middle line:90%
Who knows?

00:16:35.260 --> 00:16:37.720 align:middle line:90%
Maybe from other realms, even.

00:16:37.720 --> 00:16:39.932 align:middle line:84%
And we don't know anything
about it consciously.

00:16:39.932 --> 00:16:41.890 align:middle line:84%
That's why it's called
the subconscious, right?

00:16:41.890 --> 00:16:42.690 align:middle line:90%
>>MCKENNA: Right.

00:16:42.690 --> 00:16:45.460 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So you've got all
of these imprints and feelings

00:16:45.460 --> 00:16:48.670 align:middle line:84%
and traumas from this
lifetime and beyond that

00:16:48.670 --> 00:16:52.450 align:middle line:84%
are poking at you and
lodged in the body

00:16:52.450 --> 00:16:54.250 align:middle line:90%
and your mind's reinforcing.

00:16:54.250 --> 00:16:56.260 align:middle line:84%
So talk about that
complex a little bit more,

00:16:56.260 --> 00:17:00.160 align:middle line:84%
and then we'll go into
what Cognomovement does.

00:17:00.160 --> 00:17:05.470 align:middle line:84%
>>MCKENNA: So this is a
problem that all humans have.

00:17:05.470 --> 00:17:07.510 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: It's a
condition of being human.

00:17:07.510 --> 00:17:10.480 align:middle line:84%
This little part doesn't know
about all the other parts.

00:17:10.480 --> 00:17:11.319 align:middle line:90%
>>MCKENNA: Right.

00:17:11.319 --> 00:17:13.810 align:middle line:84%
And one of the
things is our body

00:17:13.810 --> 00:17:16.089 align:middle line:84%
is responsible,
through our energy

00:17:16.089 --> 00:17:23.359 align:middle line:84%
system, of holding on to those
thoughts and those feelings.

00:17:23.359 --> 00:17:27.339 align:middle line:84%
It does it because it's
trying to protect us.

00:17:27.339 --> 00:17:28.359 align:middle line:90%
Oh, you know--

00:17:28.359 --> 00:17:29.170 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Survival.

00:17:29.170 --> 00:17:30.670 align:middle line:90%
>>MCKENNA: It's survival.

00:17:30.670 --> 00:17:34.720 align:middle line:84%
And the body doesn't
really know that this

00:17:34.720 --> 00:17:37.090 align:middle line:90%
is no longer serving me.

00:17:37.090 --> 00:17:40.300 align:middle line:84%
It's simply no
longer serving me.

00:17:40.300 --> 00:17:44.350 align:middle line:84%
So we find the
strangest things when

00:17:44.350 --> 00:17:49.840 align:middle line:84%
we're able to identify where
this particular emotional

00:17:49.840 --> 00:17:50.800 align:middle line:90%
thing.

00:17:50.800 --> 00:17:55.510 align:middle line:84%
And then we clear it
once we've actually

00:17:55.510 --> 00:18:00.185 align:middle line:84%
broken the loop in between the
conscious mind and the body.

00:18:00.185 --> 00:18:02.560 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And we'll explain
how that happens functionally

00:18:02.560 --> 00:18:03.190 align:middle line:90%
in a bit--

00:18:03.190 --> 00:18:03.400 align:middle line:90%
>>MCKENNA: Yeah.

00:18:03.400 --> 00:18:04.790 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: --so people know
what you're talking about.

00:18:04.790 --> 00:18:04.870 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:18:04.870 --> 00:18:05.860 align:middle line:90%
>>MCKENNA: Yeah.

00:18:05.860 --> 00:18:10.510 align:middle line:84%
So once we've done
that, then it's

00:18:10.510 --> 00:18:13.080 align:middle line:90%
simply the feeling goes away.

00:18:13.080 --> 00:18:15.860 align:middle line:84%
And when the feeling goes
away, the thought goes away.

00:18:15.860 --> 00:18:16.660 align:middle line:90%
You're not--

00:18:16.660 --> 00:18:17.290 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So you
don't have anything

00:18:17.290 --> 00:18:18.740 align:middle line:90%
to reinforce this look anymore.

00:18:18.740 --> 00:18:19.540 align:middle line:90%
>>MCKENNA: Yeah.

00:18:19.540 --> 00:18:21.165 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: There's
nowhere for it to go.

00:18:21.165 --> 00:18:26.440 align:middle line:84%
>>MCKENNA: If I don't have a
feeling, I don't have a loop.

00:18:26.440 --> 00:18:30.850 align:middle line:84%
I need the feeling
for the loop, right?

00:18:30.850 --> 00:18:32.630 align:middle line:90%
And most people don't even--

00:18:32.630 --> 00:18:36.800 align:middle line:84%
it's so subtle that they don't
even recognize it's happening.

00:18:36.800 --> 00:18:40.440 align:middle line:84%
You wake up, kind of like my
mom, in a feeling of dread.

00:18:40.440 --> 00:18:41.240 align:middle line:90%
And then--

00:18:41.240 --> 00:18:41.950 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: You don't know why.

00:18:41.950 --> 00:18:43.200 align:middle line:90%
>>MCKENNA: You don't know why.

00:18:43.200 --> 00:18:45.470 align:middle line:84%
But you will find a
reason to attach it to.

00:18:45.470 --> 00:18:46.270 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:18:46.270 --> 00:18:47.852 align:middle line:90%
>>MCKENNA: So that's what we do.

00:18:47.852 --> 00:18:49.810 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Well, you take
your mom, for example.

00:18:49.810 --> 00:18:50.852 align:middle line:90%
She's going through life.

00:18:50.852 --> 00:18:53.783 align:middle line:84%
She probably didn't
plan on having 12 kids.

00:18:53.783 --> 00:18:55.450 align:middle line:84%
Who knows what she
thought might happen.

00:18:55.450 --> 00:18:58.090 align:middle line:84%
She probably thought
she'd have a family.

00:18:58.090 --> 00:19:01.120 align:middle line:84%
And so now the kids keep coming
and the kids keep coming,

00:19:01.120 --> 00:19:03.160 align:middle line:84%
and maybe she's just
simply overwhelmed.

00:19:03.160 --> 00:19:06.270 align:middle line:84%
And each day when she wakes up,
she's behind before she begins.

00:19:06.270 --> 00:19:07.070 align:middle line:90%
>>MCKENNA: Yes.

00:19:07.070 --> 00:19:08.560 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: And then this just--

00:19:08.560 --> 00:19:09.950 align:middle line:90%
every day it's reinforced.

00:19:09.950 --> 00:19:11.900 align:middle line:90%
I'm behind before I even begin.

00:19:11.900 --> 00:19:14.700 align:middle line:84%
The dread of waking up and
getting out of bed with 12 kids

00:19:14.700 --> 00:19:15.500 align:middle line:90%
waiting--

00:19:15.500 --> 00:19:15.860 align:middle line:90%
>>MCKENNA: Sure.

00:19:15.860 --> 00:19:17.460 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: --I can't
even fathom that.

00:19:17.460 --> 00:19:18.260 align:middle line:90%
>>MCKENNA: Yeah.

00:19:18.260 --> 00:19:21.500 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So you can see that
long after the kids have gone,

00:19:21.500 --> 00:19:24.020 align:middle line:84%
that's been the pattern for--
and we each have our version

00:19:24.020 --> 00:19:24.410 align:middle line:90%
of this--

00:19:24.410 --> 00:19:25.210 align:middle line:90%
>>MCKENNA: Yes.

00:19:25.210 --> 00:19:26.480 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: --for so long.

00:19:26.480 --> 00:19:28.760 align:middle line:84%
How many years has
she been waking up

00:19:28.760 --> 00:19:31.700 align:middle line:84%
with the feeling of dread
after the family left?

00:19:31.700 --> 00:19:32.950 align:middle line:90%
>>MCKENNA: Oh, it never ended.

00:19:32.950 --> 00:19:34.325 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: That's
what I'm saying.

00:19:34.325 --> 00:19:37.160 align:middle line:84%
She kept waking up, but how many
years since the family left?

00:19:37.160 --> 00:19:37.670 align:middle line:90%
>>MCKENNA: Oh, yeah.

00:19:37.670 --> 00:19:40.010 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: The impetus-- what,
20, 30 years since the family

00:19:40.010 --> 00:19:40.250 align:middle line:90%
left.

00:19:40.250 --> 00:19:40.640 align:middle line:90%
>>MCKENNA: 30 years.

00:19:40.640 --> 00:19:40.940 align:middle line:90%
30.

00:19:40.940 --> 00:19:41.240 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Exactly.

00:19:41.240 --> 00:19:41.720 align:middle line:90%
>>MCKENNA: It was a good 30.

00:19:41.720 --> 00:19:44.000 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And so we all
have our own version

00:19:44.000 --> 00:19:46.460 align:middle line:84%
of this that carries forward
and we don't question it.

00:19:46.460 --> 00:19:47.260 align:middle line:90%
>>MCKENNA: Yeah.

00:19:47.260 --> 00:19:49.640 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: It's just the
background feeling of life.

00:19:49.640 --> 00:19:50.450 align:middle line:90%
>>MCKENNA: It is.

00:19:50.450 --> 00:19:54.320 align:middle line:84%
And we don't think that
there's any other option.

00:19:54.320 --> 00:19:57.110 align:middle line:84%
Like I said, people are having
a war going on inside them

00:19:57.110 --> 00:19:58.160 align:middle line:90%
we know nothing about.

00:19:58.160 --> 00:19:59.360 align:middle line:90%
They have this feeling.

00:19:59.360 --> 00:20:02.600 align:middle line:84%
And to have a different
feeling, it's amazing.

00:20:02.600 --> 00:20:09.140 align:middle line:84%
What ends up happening is the
comment from people is, listen,

00:20:09.140 --> 00:20:11.900 align:middle line:84%
I feel like I'm in an
alternate timeline here.

00:20:11.900 --> 00:20:13.040 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:20:13.040 --> 00:20:17.300 align:middle line:84%
>>MCKENNA: Because what
reality existed before now

00:20:17.300 --> 00:20:18.780 align:middle line:90%
doesn't exist for them.

00:20:18.780 --> 00:20:21.530 align:middle line:84%
They like, I don't
know what happened.

00:20:21.530 --> 00:20:22.730 align:middle line:90%
It's just gone.

00:20:22.730 --> 00:20:25.520 align:middle line:84%
And what really did happen
is we broke the loops.

00:20:25.520 --> 00:20:27.770 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: OK, now let's talk
about breaking the loops.

00:20:27.770 --> 00:20:30.815 align:middle line:84%
So we're accessing things that
we don't know consciously.

00:20:30.815 --> 00:20:32.690 align:middle line:84%
All different kinds of
therapies, all of them

00:20:32.690 --> 00:20:33.710 align:middle line:90%
have their value.

00:20:33.710 --> 00:20:37.400 align:middle line:84%
Some people can go and speak
with a psychotherapist,

00:20:37.400 --> 00:20:40.350 align:middle line:84%
for example, and maybe touch
on something strongly enough

00:20:40.350 --> 00:20:43.280 align:middle line:84%
they can say, I need to really
dig down here and let go.

00:20:43.280 --> 00:20:44.510 align:middle line:90%
And that may work.

00:20:44.510 --> 00:20:46.340 align:middle line:84%
Someone else will go
to a hypnotherapist.

00:20:46.340 --> 00:20:48.360 align:middle line:84%
And I used to do
that for people.

00:20:48.360 --> 00:20:50.360 align:middle line:84%
And that can work because
you can get in and see

00:20:50.360 --> 00:20:51.800 align:middle line:90%
what's hidden from you.

00:20:51.800 --> 00:20:54.780 align:middle line:84%
So the hidden part will
come up a little bit faster.

00:20:54.780 --> 00:20:58.310 align:middle line:84%
But oftentimes just because
you know, it doesn't change it.

00:20:58.310 --> 00:21:00.950 align:middle line:84%
So now what we're talking
about with Cognomovement

00:21:00.950 --> 00:21:04.100 align:middle line:84%
is going in, whether you
know what it is or not,

00:21:04.100 --> 00:21:07.940 align:middle line:84%
what caused it or not,
simply breaking and causing

00:21:07.940 --> 00:21:11.750 align:middle line:84%
an interference pattern
and breaking the pattern.

00:21:11.750 --> 00:21:13.040 align:middle line:90%
>>MCKENNA: You bet.

00:21:13.040 --> 00:21:18.050 align:middle line:90%
Yes, we're breaking the pattern.

00:21:18.050 --> 00:21:21.620 align:middle line:84%
I had a seminar,
and at the seminar

00:21:21.620 --> 00:21:23.450 align:middle line:90%
there was an ophthalmologist.

00:21:23.450 --> 00:21:27.260 align:middle line:84%
And during the break,
we invite people,

00:21:27.260 --> 00:21:29.420 align:middle line:90%
whatever issue they have.

00:21:29.420 --> 00:21:33.380 align:middle line:84%
Well, he said, listen, I
have some real tough cases.

00:21:33.380 --> 00:21:37.430 align:middle line:84%
And would you mind if I invited
them for all the students

00:21:37.430 --> 00:21:38.700 align:middle line:90%
to work on?

00:21:38.700 --> 00:21:39.500 align:middle line:90%
I said certainly.

00:21:39.500 --> 00:21:40.310 align:middle line:90%
Bring everybody.

00:21:40.310 --> 00:21:42.180 align:middle line:90%
I have no idea.

00:21:42.180 --> 00:21:44.120 align:middle line:84%
It's like tough
cases from a doctor?

00:21:44.120 --> 00:21:46.580 align:middle line:84%
I don't know what's going
to walk in the door.

00:21:46.580 --> 00:21:52.760 align:middle line:84%
So he says, listen,
this one here, there

00:21:52.760 --> 00:21:58.190 align:middle line:84%
was a situation in a communist
country where a family got

00:21:58.190 --> 00:22:02.810 align:middle line:84%
arrested because the father had
said something about leadership

00:22:02.810 --> 00:22:04.220 align:middle line:90%
in the country.

00:22:04.220 --> 00:22:07.980 align:middle line:90%
He said publicly.

00:22:07.980 --> 00:22:09.320 align:middle line:90%
And he was just--

00:22:09.320 --> 00:22:11.610 align:middle line:84%
it was matter of
fact, no big deal.

00:22:11.610 --> 00:22:12.410 align:middle line:90%
He got arrested.

00:22:12.410 --> 00:22:13.702 align:middle line:90%
The whole family gets arrested.

00:22:13.702 --> 00:22:15.920 align:middle line:90%
They're put in a prison camp.

00:22:15.920 --> 00:22:20.030 align:middle line:84%
And a 9-year-old daughter--
he has a 9-year-old daughter,

00:22:20.030 --> 00:22:24.740 align:middle line:84%
and she's put in along with
wife, grandma, everybody.

00:22:24.740 --> 00:22:26.660 align:middle line:84%
At a certain point
in time, there

00:22:26.660 --> 00:22:30.410 align:middle line:84%
is an execution that
is going to take place.

00:22:30.410 --> 00:22:32.630 align:middle line:84%
For some reason in
this country, you

00:22:32.630 --> 00:22:35.270 align:middle line:84%
have to have a witness
to the execution.

00:22:35.270 --> 00:22:38.810 align:middle line:84%
And they said to
the family, listen,

00:22:38.810 --> 00:22:41.930 align:middle line:84%
you've got to choose somebody
who's going to be a witness.

00:22:41.930 --> 00:22:44.000 align:middle line:84%
And they chose the
9-year-old little girl.

00:22:44.000 --> 00:22:46.070 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: I don't even want
to go into how that could have

00:22:46.070 --> 00:22:46.520 align:middle line:90%
happened--

00:22:46.520 --> 00:22:47.250 align:middle line:90%
>>MCKENNA: I don't know.

00:22:47.250 --> 00:22:48.050 align:middle line:90%
I have no idea.

00:22:48.050 --> 00:22:50.540 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: --to choose a child
to traumatize like that.

00:22:50.540 --> 00:22:52.280 align:middle line:90%
OK, so what happened?

00:22:52.280 --> 00:22:54.590 align:middle line:84%
>>MCKENNA: The 9-year-old
girl witnesses the execution.

00:22:54.590 --> 00:22:55.713 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Of whom?

00:22:55.713 --> 00:22:56.630 align:middle line:90%
Someone in the family?

00:22:56.630 --> 00:22:58.740 align:middle line:84%
>>MCKENNA: Someone-- no,
it wasn't in the-- it

00:22:58.740 --> 00:22:59.540 align:middle line:90%
was someone else.

00:22:59.540 --> 00:23:00.340 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: OK.

00:23:00.340 --> 00:23:02.690 align:middle line:84%
>>MCKENNA: She witnessed it,
and it's only 2 feet away.

00:23:02.690 --> 00:23:03.490 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: OK.

00:23:03.490 --> 00:23:05.660 align:middle line:84%
>>MCKENNA: She gets
splattered with blood,

00:23:05.660 --> 00:23:10.610 align:middle line:90%
passes out, and wakes up blind.

00:23:10.610 --> 00:23:12.560 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: OK, you
can understand that.

00:23:12.560 --> 00:23:14.330 align:middle line:90%
>>MCKENNA: I understand.

00:23:14.330 --> 00:23:18.470 align:middle line:84%
Now she's 40-some-odd
years old, pushing 50.

00:23:18.470 --> 00:23:20.900 align:middle line:84%
She has a little bit
of vision in one eye,

00:23:20.900 --> 00:23:21.890 align:middle line:90%
but hardly anything.

00:23:21.890 --> 00:23:24.290 align:middle line:90%
The other eye is 100% blind.

00:23:24.290 --> 00:23:26.180 align:middle line:84%
And the doctor
says, listen, if you

00:23:26.180 --> 00:23:30.500 align:middle line:84%
say anything about the execution
and that this blindness is

00:23:30.500 --> 00:23:35.030 align:middle line:84%
related to it, then
you've lost her.

00:23:35.030 --> 00:23:36.347 align:middle line:90%
She won't do anything.

00:23:36.347 --> 00:23:38.180 align:middle line:84%
But I'm going to invite
her over because you

00:23:38.180 --> 00:23:39.770 align:middle line:90%
have some techniques.

00:23:39.770 --> 00:23:41.480 align:middle line:90%
Invites her over.

00:23:41.480 --> 00:23:43.230 align:middle line:90%
And I knew this.

00:23:43.230 --> 00:23:45.488 align:middle line:84%
So one of the fabulous
things about the work I do--

00:23:45.488 --> 00:23:47.780 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Well, how could
you even do this with someone

00:23:47.780 --> 00:23:48.320 align:middle line:90%
who can't see?

00:23:48.320 --> 00:23:49.760 align:middle line:84%
>>MCKENNA: She had a little
bit of vision in one eye.

00:23:49.760 --> 00:23:51.080 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: OK.

00:23:51.080 --> 00:23:53.520 align:middle line:90%
>>MCKENNA: So there we are.

00:23:53.520 --> 00:23:54.320 align:middle line:90%
She comes in.

00:23:54.320 --> 00:23:57.470 align:middle line:90%
She has those dark glasses on.

00:23:57.470 --> 00:23:58.550 align:middle line:90%
And she's like this.

00:23:58.550 --> 00:24:00.980 align:middle line:90%
And she is in pain.

00:24:00.980 --> 00:24:03.710 align:middle line:84%
Literally, she's
in physical pain.

00:24:03.710 --> 00:24:06.220 align:middle line:84%
She said the only way that
she can get through life

00:24:06.220 --> 00:24:08.050 align:middle line:90%
is to lay on the floor.

00:24:08.050 --> 00:24:10.750 align:middle line:84%
Most days, she
literally just lays

00:24:10.750 --> 00:24:12.700 align:middle line:90%
on the floor in a dark room.

00:24:12.700 --> 00:24:17.200 align:middle line:84%
She comes in, and she's kind
of moaning, like, [GROANS]..

00:24:17.200 --> 00:24:18.970 align:middle line:84%
And she had her hat
on over her eyes,

00:24:18.970 --> 00:24:21.910 align:middle line:84%
the glasses on and covering
her eyes, into a room.

00:24:21.910 --> 00:24:23.867 align:middle line:84%
It's just a normal room
with normal lighting.

00:24:23.867 --> 00:24:25.450 align:middle line:84%
We had all the lights
off, but there's

00:24:25.450 --> 00:24:29.710 align:middle line:84%
a little bit of light coming in
from the windows, a little bit.

00:24:29.710 --> 00:24:33.430 align:middle line:90%
And I ended up working with her.

00:24:33.430 --> 00:24:39.760 align:middle line:84%
Now, what I did was I
merely took Cognomovement,

00:24:39.760 --> 00:24:43.930 align:middle line:84%
and I did Cognomovement
with her and told her,

00:24:43.930 --> 00:24:46.060 align:middle line:90%
only focus on your eyes.

00:24:46.060 --> 00:24:49.240 align:middle line:84%
I want you to feel
how upsetting it

00:24:49.240 --> 00:24:52.060 align:middle line:84%
is your whole life
with this vision,

00:24:52.060 --> 00:24:55.840 align:middle line:84%
that you are having problems,
that you're in such pain

00:24:55.840 --> 00:25:00.155 align:middle line:84%
that you are having
to have not a life.

00:25:00.155 --> 00:25:01.280 align:middle line:90%
You're laying on the floor.

00:25:01.280 --> 00:25:03.530 align:middle line:84%
I want you to feel that, and
I want you to concentrate

00:25:03.530 --> 00:25:04.540 align:middle line:90%
on the blind eye.

00:25:04.540 --> 00:25:08.740 align:middle line:84%
And it was about an
hour, an hour later.

00:25:08.740 --> 00:25:10.900 align:middle line:84%
We just worked with
her bit by bit.

00:25:10.900 --> 00:25:12.390 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Did you do a little
bit of movement with the ball?

00:25:12.390 --> 00:25:13.180 align:middle line:90%
>>MCKENNA: A little bit.

00:25:13.180 --> 00:25:15.100 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: A tiny bit, as
much as she could see.

00:25:15.100 --> 00:25:16.642 align:middle line:84%
>>MCKENNA: As much
as she could take.

00:25:16.642 --> 00:25:19.600 align:middle line:84%
And it started off where the
first movements were like, ah!

00:25:19.600 --> 00:25:22.570 align:middle line:84%
And literally she
would fall over.

00:25:22.570 --> 00:25:24.730 align:middle line:84%
So I had to go really
slow, but I just

00:25:24.730 --> 00:25:26.710 align:middle line:90%
had her focus on her eyes.

00:25:26.710 --> 00:25:34.230 align:middle line:84%
And an hour later, bit by bit
by bit, the eyesight came back.

00:25:34.230 --> 00:25:35.410 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Wow.

00:25:35.410 --> 00:25:37.720 align:middle line:84%
>>MCKENNA: The thing--
the glasses came off.

00:25:37.720 --> 00:25:39.850 align:middle line:90%
The hat comes off.

00:25:39.850 --> 00:25:44.990 align:middle line:84%
She is dancing,
literally dancing--

00:25:44.990 --> 00:25:45.790 align:middle line:90%
dancing.

00:25:45.790 --> 00:25:45.970 align:middle line:90%
So--

00:25:45.970 --> 00:25:46.928 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Unbelievable.

00:25:46.928 --> 00:25:48.875 align:middle line:84%
>>MCKENNA: Yeah, it
was just wonderful.

00:25:48.875 --> 00:25:49.750 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Oh my gosh.

00:25:49.750 --> 00:25:52.900 align:middle line:84%
OK, now let's talk about
that and how that happens.

00:25:52.900 --> 00:25:55.510 align:middle line:84%
Because with someone
who is sighted,

00:25:55.510 --> 00:25:58.510 align:middle line:84%
a normal person, like you said--
you alluded to this earlier--

00:25:58.510 --> 00:26:00.220 align:middle line:90%
you have them focus on the pain.

00:26:00.220 --> 00:26:00.490 align:middle line:90%
>>MCKENNA: Yes.

00:26:00.490 --> 00:26:01.180 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: The problem.

00:26:01.180 --> 00:26:02.305 align:middle line:90%
>>MCKENNA: Yeah, emotional.

00:26:02.305 --> 00:26:04.940 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: The emotional
problem, and to really feel it.

00:26:04.940 --> 00:26:05.740 align:middle line:90%
>>MCKENNA: Yes.

00:26:05.740 --> 00:26:05.930 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Feel it.

00:26:05.930 --> 00:26:07.230 align:middle line:90%
Don't lose track of it.

00:26:07.230 --> 00:26:09.970 align:middle line:84%
Now, so that's living in the
emotional part of the body.

00:26:09.970 --> 00:26:12.550 align:middle line:84%
Might you might
even say possibly

00:26:12.550 --> 00:26:14.690 align:middle line:84%
associated with the
right side of the brain?

00:26:14.690 --> 00:26:15.490 align:middle line:90%
Right?

00:26:15.490 --> 00:26:16.290 align:middle line:90%
>>MCKENNA: Mm-hm.

00:26:16.290 --> 00:26:18.980 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Now you're introducing
something cognitive, right?

00:26:18.980 --> 00:26:19.780 align:middle line:90%
>>MCKENNA: Right.

00:26:19.780 --> 00:26:22.130 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So in this case,
it's this ball, right?

00:26:22.130 --> 00:26:22.930 align:middle line:90%
>>MCKENNA: Right.

00:26:22.930 --> 00:26:25.000 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: So you have this ball.

00:26:25.000 --> 00:26:28.540 align:middle line:84%
And so what happens
is you have people--

00:26:28.540 --> 00:26:30.280 align:middle line:84%
you're throwing or
the practitioner

00:26:30.280 --> 00:26:32.630 align:middle line:84%
is throwing the
ball back and forth

00:26:32.630 --> 00:26:34.930 align:middle line:84%
to different sides of
the body, back and forth.

00:26:34.930 --> 00:26:38.620 align:middle line:84%
And you have to, as the person
who's being worked with,

00:26:38.620 --> 00:26:41.140 align:middle line:84%
you have to identify
feeling what you're feeling

00:26:41.140 --> 00:26:43.510 align:middle line:84%
and then looking
at the color that's

00:26:43.510 --> 00:26:45.205 align:middle line:84%
most prominent as
it comes toward you

00:26:45.205 --> 00:26:46.330 align:middle line:90%
and say the color out loud.

00:26:46.330 --> 00:26:46.690 align:middle line:90%
>>MCKENNA: Correct.

00:26:46.690 --> 00:26:48.690 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Now that's the
left side of the brain.

00:26:48.690 --> 00:26:49.690 align:middle line:90%
>>MCKENNA: Yeah.

00:26:49.690 --> 00:26:53.380 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: You've engaged the
cognitive structured side

00:26:53.380 --> 00:26:54.410 align:middle line:90%
of the brain, right?

00:26:54.410 --> 00:26:55.210 align:middle line:90%
>>MCKENNA: Right.

00:26:55.210 --> 00:26:58.090 align:middle line:84%
So left brain was the
colors and symbols.

00:26:58.090 --> 00:27:01.790 align:middle line:84%
Right brain is the
three-dimensional object,

00:27:01.790 --> 00:27:03.640 align:middle line:90%
which is the ball.

00:27:03.640 --> 00:27:06.650 align:middle line:84%
And the crossing over,
over the center line--

00:27:06.650 --> 00:27:07.450 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:27:07.450 --> 00:27:08.950 align:middle line:84%
>>MCKENNA: --is
crossing information

00:27:08.950 --> 00:27:12.140 align:middle line:84%
across the corpus callosum, left
and right sides of the brain.

00:27:12.140 --> 00:27:14.110 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Which also
NLP and all this all

00:27:14.110 --> 00:27:15.340 align:middle line:90%
comes into it, kind of.

00:27:15.340 --> 00:27:16.360 align:middle line:90%
>>MCKENNA: Yes, it does.

00:27:16.360 --> 00:27:17.160 align:middle line:90%
Yes, it does.

00:27:17.160 --> 00:27:20.980 align:middle line:84%
We have a fabulous person that's
joined me, Liz Larson, who

00:27:20.980 --> 00:27:23.080 align:middle line:90%
is a master NLP practitioner.

00:27:23.080 --> 00:27:28.060 align:middle line:84%
And she was like, well, let's
start doing it low to high.

00:27:28.060 --> 00:27:30.800 align:middle line:84%
And when you're low,
your eyes are low,

00:27:30.800 --> 00:27:33.712 align:middle line:84%
you're actually connected to the
kinesthetic part of your body.

00:27:33.712 --> 00:27:35.170 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So while
you're down low,

00:27:35.170 --> 00:27:37.430 align:middle line:84%
you can really feel the
feelings in the body.

00:27:37.430 --> 00:27:42.160 align:middle line:84%
So if you're receiving the
ball on a low trajectory,

00:27:42.160 --> 00:27:44.780 align:middle line:84%
you're able to stay in
the feelings more solidly.

00:27:44.780 --> 00:27:45.580 align:middle line:90%
>>MCKENNA: Yes.

00:27:45.580 --> 00:27:46.060 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: OK.

00:27:46.060 --> 00:27:47.352 align:middle line:90%
>>MCKENNA: So it's kinesthetic.

00:27:47.352 --> 00:27:50.500 align:middle line:84%
It's the three ways that we
learn-- kinesthetic, auditory,

00:27:50.500 --> 00:27:51.550 align:middle line:90%
and visual.

00:27:51.550 --> 00:27:54.130 align:middle line:90%
Your kinesthetic is down.

00:27:54.130 --> 00:27:56.860 align:middle line:90%
Your level is auditory.

00:27:56.860 --> 00:27:59.480 align:middle line:90%
And your visual is up.

00:27:59.480 --> 00:28:01.480 align:middle line:84%
And every time you move
the ball left, right,

00:28:01.480 --> 00:28:03.682 align:middle line:84%
it also moves the information
left to right brain.

00:28:03.682 --> 00:28:05.640 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So let's talk
about what's happening.

00:28:05.640 --> 00:28:08.410 align:middle line:84%
You're tossing the ball
back and forth down low,

00:28:08.410 --> 00:28:11.080 align:middle line:84%
and you're seeing
a blue, orange.

00:28:11.080 --> 00:28:11.890 align:middle line:90%
Keep feeling it.

00:28:11.890 --> 00:28:12.910 align:middle line:90%
Keep feeling it, right?

00:28:12.910 --> 00:28:13.030 align:middle line:90%
>>MCKENNA: Yep.

00:28:13.030 --> 00:28:14.560 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Keep coaching people.

00:28:14.560 --> 00:28:15.620 align:middle line:90%
Feel that feeling, right?

00:28:15.620 --> 00:28:16.420 align:middle line:90%
>>MCKENNA: Yeah.

00:28:16.420 --> 00:28:17.337 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: You feel it.

00:28:17.337 --> 00:28:18.880 align:middle line:90%
So what is happening there?

00:28:18.880 --> 00:28:22.960 align:middle line:84%
Because we want to move into
how it's breaking the patterns.

00:28:22.960 --> 00:28:25.360 align:middle line:90%
>>MCKENNA: Ahh, very good.

00:28:25.360 --> 00:28:31.040 align:middle line:84%
So interesting thing that this
has all evolved over time.

00:28:31.040 --> 00:28:36.040 align:middle line:84%
And the way that
this works is we're

00:28:36.040 --> 00:28:41.690 align:middle line:84%
challenging your neurological
response to things.

00:28:41.690 --> 00:28:48.040 align:middle line:84%
For example, if you are telling
a story about being victimized,

00:28:48.040 --> 00:28:51.280 align:middle line:84%
or you're telling a happy
story of something that

00:28:51.280 --> 00:28:53.710 align:middle line:84%
happened to you, you
will move your eyes

00:28:53.710 --> 00:28:56.050 align:middle line:90%
into a certain position.

00:28:56.050 --> 00:28:56.850 align:middle line:90%
You will--

00:28:56.850 --> 00:28:58.933 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: That's kind of
classic NLP stuff, right?

00:28:58.933 --> 00:29:00.702 align:middle line:84%
>>MCKENNA: Classic
NLP stuff, right?

00:29:00.702 --> 00:29:02.285 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Neurolinguistic
Programming.

00:29:02.285 --> 00:29:05.460 align:middle line:84%
>>MCKENNA: You also have
postures and places outside

00:29:05.460 --> 00:29:09.700 align:middle line:84%
of you that this is as
well, which we'll get into.

00:29:09.700 --> 00:29:14.490 align:middle line:84%
But what we do is we
get you moving in ways

00:29:14.490 --> 00:29:17.250 align:middle line:90%
that you had not moved before.

00:29:17.250 --> 00:29:21.480 align:middle line:84%
And also we're lighting up
the part of the brain that

00:29:21.480 --> 00:29:23.890 align:middle line:90%
has this particular issue.

00:29:23.890 --> 00:29:27.750 align:middle line:84%
So when you think about a
particular issue, whatever

00:29:27.750 --> 00:29:31.140 align:middle line:84%
that issue might be,
you will light up

00:29:31.140 --> 00:29:32.860 align:middle line:90%
that part of the brain.

00:29:32.860 --> 00:29:37.470 align:middle line:84%
And when now you start
moving across the center

00:29:37.470 --> 00:29:40.140 align:middle line:84%
line of the body, it will
start moving information

00:29:40.140 --> 00:29:41.890 align:middle line:84%
to the opposite
lobe of the brain.

00:29:41.890 --> 00:29:44.760 align:middle line:84%
And not only that,
but you're moving it

00:29:44.760 --> 00:29:46.750 align:middle line:84%
on the different
parts of the brain.

00:29:46.750 --> 00:29:49.380 align:middle line:90%
So it's like creating genius.

00:29:49.380 --> 00:29:53.040 align:middle line:10%
And that's why we get
people that are just

00:29:53.040 --> 00:29:55.890 align:middle line:10%
having all kinds of
amazing creativity,

00:29:55.890 --> 00:29:57.870 align:middle line:10%
like I talked about
about that artist.

00:29:57.870 --> 00:29:58.890 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:29:58.890 --> 00:30:01.050 align:middle line:84%
>>MCKENNA: It's just
simply mechanically

00:30:01.050 --> 00:30:04.770 align:middle line:84%
forcing greater
levels of creativity.

00:30:04.770 --> 00:30:10.470 align:middle line:84%
So not only will it work
on just your creativity,

00:30:10.470 --> 00:30:15.790 align:middle line:84%
but it works on so many
other things as well.

00:30:15.790 --> 00:30:20.620 align:middle line:84%
For example, we talked about
the woman who lost her eyesight.

00:30:20.620 --> 00:30:22.980 align:middle line:90%
We call it hysterical blindness.

00:30:22.980 --> 00:30:25.493 align:middle line:90%
But there was another woman--

00:30:25.493 --> 00:30:27.660 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: By the way, did
she maintain her eyesight?

00:30:27.660 --> 00:30:28.930 align:middle line:90%
>>MCKENNA: As far as I know.

00:30:28.930 --> 00:30:30.630 align:middle line:90%
As far as I know.

00:30:30.630 --> 00:30:33.930 align:middle line:84%
So there was another
woman who came to me,

00:30:33.930 --> 00:30:36.900 align:middle line:84%
and she had hearing
loss in one ear.

00:30:36.900 --> 00:30:41.370 align:middle line:84%
Now, this is interesting because
it ties into the Bio-Well.

00:30:41.370 --> 00:30:46.350 align:middle line:84%
Now, with the Bio-Well,
I found out about this

00:30:46.350 --> 00:30:49.680 align:middle line:84%
because I knew we were
feeling things in the body.

00:30:49.680 --> 00:30:51.450 align:middle line:84%
The last interview
I did with you,

00:30:51.450 --> 00:30:54.510 align:middle line:84%
we knew I could feel things
in the body happening.

00:30:54.510 --> 00:30:56.880 align:middle line:84%
And people were saying,
this is happening to me

00:30:56.880 --> 00:30:57.870 align:middle line:90%
in their chakras.

00:30:57.870 --> 00:30:59.100 align:middle line:90%
We didn't know.

00:30:59.100 --> 00:31:04.590 align:middle line:84%
So I went off, and fortunately
I ran into Tiffany Barsotti.

00:31:04.590 --> 00:31:09.360 align:middle line:84%
And she got me the Bio-Well
and all the training--

00:31:09.360 --> 00:31:10.470 align:middle line:90%
amazing trainer.

00:31:10.470 --> 00:31:15.090 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And this is the
child of Konstantin Korotkov,

00:31:15.090 --> 00:31:16.360 align:middle line:90%
the Russian scientist--

00:31:16.360 --> 00:31:17.160 align:middle line:90%
>>MCKENNA: Yes.

00:31:17.160 --> 00:31:21.060 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: --who had done a
much larger, a little more

00:31:21.060 --> 00:31:25.380 align:middle line:84%
difficult to operate,
very sensitive

00:31:25.380 --> 00:31:27.210 align:middle line:84%
technology prior to
this that he wanted

00:31:27.210 --> 00:31:30.480 align:middle line:84%
to make it available to
practitioners and people,

00:31:30.480 --> 00:31:33.390 align:middle line:84%
everyday people, so you
could very quickly and easily

00:31:33.390 --> 00:31:37.110 align:middle line:84%
read the biofield
of an environment,

00:31:37.110 --> 00:31:38.260 align:middle line:90%
of people, et cetera.

00:31:38.260 --> 00:31:40.050 align:middle line:84%
So we just have to
back up a second there.

00:31:40.050 --> 00:31:43.170 align:middle line:84%
So the Bio-Well, you
stick your fingers in,

00:31:43.170 --> 00:31:45.990 align:middle line:84%
and it reads your
energy and reflects

00:31:45.990 --> 00:31:49.770 align:middle line:84%
that back in a graphic rendition
of where your energy is

00:31:49.770 --> 00:31:51.900 align:middle line:84%
distributed and
how forceful it is,

00:31:51.900 --> 00:31:53.440 align:middle line:90%
how weak it is, and so forth.

00:31:53.440 --> 00:31:58.830 align:middle line:84%
So it gives you some
evidence before and after

00:31:58.830 --> 00:32:01.420 align:middle line:84%
as to what happens in a session
and the way you're using it,

00:32:01.420 --> 00:32:02.220 align:middle line:90%
right?

00:32:02.220 --> 00:32:02.670 align:middle line:90%
>>MCKENNA: Yes.

00:32:02.670 --> 00:32:03.150 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:32:03.150 --> 00:32:04.775 align:middle line:84%
>>MCKENNA: It's
basically a combination

00:32:04.775 --> 00:32:08.220 align:middle line:84%
of Kirilian photography and
Korean finger tip acupuncture.

00:32:08.220 --> 00:32:12.120 align:middle line:84%
They know every single
meridian in your finger

00:32:12.120 --> 00:32:14.370 align:middle line:84%
and what it relates to
on the entire system.

00:32:14.370 --> 00:32:15.170 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:32:15.170 --> 00:32:16.800 align:middle line:90%
>>MCKENNA: Right?

00:32:16.800 --> 00:32:18.000 align:middle line:90%
So I go to the--

00:32:18.000 --> 00:32:21.060 align:middle line:84%
I do the three-day
seminar with Tiffany,

00:32:21.060 --> 00:32:25.440 align:middle line:84%
and she's talking
about what to look for.

00:32:25.440 --> 00:32:29.100 align:middle line:84%
And she mentioned, in one
of the reports that you get,

00:32:29.100 --> 00:32:32.650 align:middle line:84%
it shows you every
organ in your body.

00:32:32.650 --> 00:32:36.510 align:middle line:84%
And it can show you
your emotional energy

00:32:36.510 --> 00:32:38.590 align:middle line:90%
and your physical energy.

00:32:38.590 --> 00:32:42.390 align:middle line:84%
And she had mentioned, well, the
thorax behind the heart, when

00:32:42.390 --> 00:32:46.720 align:middle line:84%
the lines cross, in
this particular report,

00:32:46.720 --> 00:32:50.460 align:middle line:84%
you should ask the
question about betrayal.

00:32:50.460 --> 00:32:52.327 align:middle line:90%
So here I am.

00:32:52.327 --> 00:32:53.160 align:middle line:90%
I've got this woman.

00:32:53.160 --> 00:32:53.960 align:middle line:90%
She comes to me.

00:32:53.960 --> 00:32:56.100 align:middle line:84%
She's got hearing
loss in her ear.

00:32:56.100 --> 00:32:58.110 align:middle line:90%
And I take the Bio-Well reading.

00:32:58.110 --> 00:33:00.990 align:middle line:84%
And I'm looking at the
report, and, bam, there it is.

00:33:00.990 --> 00:33:05.640 align:middle line:84%
Behind the heart, the
lines have crossed over.

00:33:05.640 --> 00:33:12.460 align:middle line:90%
And I said, hey, you--

00:33:12.460 --> 00:33:15.820 align:middle line:84%
anything happen around the
time of loss of hearing?

00:33:15.820 --> 00:33:19.558 align:middle line:90%
Nope, just lost my hearing.

00:33:19.558 --> 00:33:21.600 align:middle line:84%
And she had spent a lot
of money on hearing aids,

00:33:21.600 --> 00:33:22.790 align:middle line:90%
stuff like that.

00:33:22.790 --> 00:33:24.730 align:middle line:90%
And so she didn't connect it.

00:33:24.730 --> 00:33:27.460 align:middle line:84%
And I said, well,
what about betrayal

00:33:27.460 --> 00:33:30.400 align:middle line:84%
right around the time of the
hearing loss and right before

00:33:30.400 --> 00:33:31.210 align:middle line:90%
then?

00:33:31.210 --> 00:33:36.130 align:middle line:90%
And she was like, oh, yeah.

00:33:36.130 --> 00:33:39.280 align:middle line:84%
She had two relatives
that were very, very close

00:33:39.280 --> 00:33:42.850 align:middle line:84%
to her that couldn't believe
it-- lifetime betrayal type

00:33:42.850 --> 00:33:44.300 align:middle line:90%
thing.

00:33:44.300 --> 00:33:46.970 align:middle line:84%
So I say, I want you to
just feel the betrayal.

00:33:46.970 --> 00:33:50.690 align:middle line:84%
And we're at a 95%
loss in that ear.

00:33:50.690 --> 00:33:51.690 align:middle line:90%
Feel the betrayal.

00:33:51.690 --> 00:33:52.490 align:middle line:90%
Boom, boom, boom.

00:33:52.490 --> 00:33:56.030 align:middle line:84%
We do it, and I just
kept her in the betrayal.

00:33:56.030 --> 00:33:59.180 align:middle line:84%
Checked in with her
after a few minutes.

00:33:59.180 --> 00:34:02.705 align:middle line:84%
The hearing's starting to
come back and more and more.

00:34:02.705 --> 00:34:04.370 align:middle line:84%
And this one ended
up-- we really

00:34:04.370 --> 00:34:09.170 align:middle line:84%
had to work for an hour or so,
but got all her hearing back.

00:34:09.170 --> 00:34:09.980 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Holy cow.

00:34:09.980 --> 00:34:12.110 align:middle line:84%
>>MCKENNA: Yeah,
and the betrayal.

00:34:12.110 --> 00:34:14.600 align:middle line:84%
And consequently, the
betrayal, the feelings

00:34:14.600 --> 00:34:16.699 align:middle line:90%
of resentment and all those--

00:34:16.699 --> 00:34:18.690 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Yes, everything
that goes with it.

00:34:18.690 --> 00:34:20.290 align:middle line:84%
>>MCKENNA: There's so many
things that go with it.

00:34:20.290 --> 00:34:21.090 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:34:21.090 --> 00:34:24.089 align:middle line:84%
Well, OK, so now did you
do her fingers afterward?

00:34:24.089 --> 00:34:24.889 align:middle line:90%
>>MCKENNA: Oh yeah.

00:34:24.889 --> 00:34:25.540 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And then
what happened?

00:34:25.540 --> 00:34:26.832 align:middle line:90%
>>MCKENNA: The lines separated.

00:34:26.832 --> 00:34:28.280 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: The line
was separated.

00:34:28.280 --> 00:34:29.080 align:middle line:90%
>>MCKENNA: Mm-hmm.

00:34:29.080 --> 00:34:30.330 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:34:30.330 --> 00:34:31.199 align:middle line:90%
Isn't that cool?

00:34:31.199 --> 00:34:33.199 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: It's so cool.

00:34:33.199 --> 00:34:34.370 align:middle line:90%
I mean, it's not a miracle.

00:34:34.370 --> 00:34:36.930 align:middle line:84%
You're doing something that
actually functionally works.

00:34:36.930 --> 00:34:37.730 align:middle line:90%
>>MCKENNA: Yeah.

00:34:37.730 --> 00:34:40.070 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And this is
something that can be proven

00:34:40.070 --> 00:34:41.300 align:middle line:90%
and is functional.

00:34:41.300 --> 00:34:44.010 align:middle line:84%
So that's what's wonderful,
because for her, she already

00:34:44.010 --> 00:34:44.810 align:middle line:90%
knew.

00:34:44.810 --> 00:34:46.010 align:middle line:90%
She had her hearing back.

00:34:46.010 --> 00:34:49.460 align:middle line:84%
But for you, it helps you
understand, OK, we really

00:34:49.460 --> 00:34:51.800 align:middle line:84%
hit the mark because I can
even see it in her field.

00:34:51.800 --> 00:34:53.510 align:middle line:84%
>>MCKENNA: Oh,
it's a great tool.

00:34:53.510 --> 00:34:53.929 align:middle line:90%
I--

00:34:53.929 --> 00:34:55.554 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: You offered
to do that on me,

00:34:55.554 --> 00:34:56.820 align:middle line:90%
and I had done it once before.

00:34:56.820 --> 00:35:00.170 align:middle line:84%
And I didn't tell you why
I didn't want to do it.

00:35:00.170 --> 00:35:04.970 align:middle line:90%
But the time I did it--

00:35:04.970 --> 00:35:06.020 align:middle line:90%
how do I say this?

00:35:06.020 --> 00:35:09.230 align:middle line:84%
Some people live closer in
their bodies than others, right?

00:35:09.230 --> 00:35:14.420 align:middle line:84%
And when I did it, you can see
the chakras lining up in it,

00:35:14.420 --> 00:35:15.350 align:middle line:90%
right?

00:35:15.350 --> 00:35:17.110 align:middle line:84%
And that's the one
that they must have

00:35:17.110 --> 00:35:19.040 align:middle line:90%
read when I put my fingers in.

00:35:19.040 --> 00:35:21.470 align:middle line:84%
And so I was essentially
sitting next to myself.

00:35:21.470 --> 00:35:22.920 align:middle line:90%
And that has happened before.

00:35:22.920 --> 00:35:25.290 align:middle line:84%
So all my chakras were
lined up way over here.

00:35:25.290 --> 00:35:26.090 align:middle line:90%
It was fine.

00:35:26.090 --> 00:35:28.220 align:middle line:84%
It just wasn't anywhere
near me or my body.

00:35:28.220 --> 00:35:28.520 align:middle line:90%
>>MCKENNA: Yeah.

00:35:28.520 --> 00:35:30.650 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And so it freaked
the other person out,

00:35:30.650 --> 00:35:34.340 align:middle line:84%
and they interpreted it
in a totally different way

00:35:34.340 --> 00:35:36.510 align:middle line:84%
than I feel it
and experience it.

00:35:36.510 --> 00:35:39.770 align:middle line:84%
So in that sense, you have to
know how to read a person too.

00:35:39.770 --> 00:35:42.200 align:middle line:84%
And I just thought, I'm
leaving that stuff alone.

00:35:42.200 --> 00:35:44.220 align:middle line:84%
I don't want any more
explanations, you know?

00:35:44.220 --> 00:35:45.020 align:middle line:90%
>>MCKENNA: Sure.

00:35:45.020 --> 00:35:46.010 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So you
know what I mean?

00:35:46.010 --> 00:35:46.830 align:middle line:90%
>>MCKENNA: Yes, I do.

00:35:46.830 --> 00:35:47.270 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:35:47.270 --> 00:35:49.890 align:middle line:84%
Because if someone had been
more mature in the use of it,

00:35:49.890 --> 00:35:53.480 align:middle line:84%
they might say, oh, well
this is interesting.

00:35:53.480 --> 00:35:54.860 align:middle line:90%
>>MCKENNA: That is.

00:35:54.860 --> 00:35:58.603 align:middle line:84%
As you go on in time, you
get more and more mature.

00:35:58.603 --> 00:36:00.770 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: More experience,
and then you can see, oh,

00:36:00.770 --> 00:36:02.315 align:middle line:90%
I see what this might mean.

00:36:02.315 --> 00:36:02.600 align:middle line:90%
>>MCKENNA: Yes.

00:36:02.600 --> 00:36:04.100 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So anyway, I'm
just confessing to you,

00:36:04.100 --> 00:36:05.323 align:middle line:90%
that's why I didn't do it.

00:36:05.323 --> 00:36:07.490 align:middle line:84%
I thought, don't need to
hear some weird stuff here.

00:36:07.490 --> 00:36:08.687 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHS]

00:36:08.687 --> 00:36:09.770 align:middle line:90%
>>MCKENNA: Understandable.

00:36:09.770 --> 00:36:10.570 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:36:10.570 --> 00:36:13.100 align:middle line:84%
So anyway, you get the
feedback back there.

00:36:13.100 --> 00:36:15.900 align:middle line:84%
Now we're going to look at
some examples of some of the--

00:36:15.900 --> 00:36:16.700 align:middle line:90%
>>MCKENNA: Oh, OK.

00:36:16.700 --> 00:36:17.400 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Do you
want to do that?

00:36:17.400 --> 00:36:17.990 align:middle line:90%
>>MCKENNA: Yeah.

00:36:17.990 --> 00:36:19.610 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: OK, we'll look
at some of the examples

00:36:19.610 --> 00:36:21.660 align:middle line:84%
where you got before and
after Bio-Well imprints.

00:36:21.660 --> 00:36:22.460 align:middle line:90%
>>MCKENNA: Yeah.

00:36:22.460 --> 00:36:22.970 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: OK.

00:36:22.970 --> 00:36:24.803 align:middle line:84%
So let me get to my
notes because I actually

00:36:24.803 --> 00:36:28.160 align:middle line:84%
have to get back to my
notes now on this one.

00:36:28.160 --> 00:36:30.740 align:middle line:84%
OK, this one we're
going to look at here

00:36:30.740 --> 00:36:34.570 align:middle line:84%
is an image of a woman
who had a fear of falling.

00:36:34.570 --> 00:36:35.510 align:middle line:90%
>>MCKENNA: Oh, yeah.

00:36:35.510 --> 00:36:37.340 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: OK, tell
us about this woman.

00:36:37.340 --> 00:36:41.120 align:middle line:84%
And then we're going to look
at her Bio-Well before and then

00:36:41.120 --> 00:36:42.110 align:middle line:90%
what happened after.

00:36:42.110 --> 00:36:42.910 align:middle line:90%
>>MCKENNA: Woo!

00:36:42.910 --> 00:36:43.827 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Here she is.

00:36:43.827 --> 00:36:45.292 align:middle line:84%
>>MCKENNA: Yeah,
so this one here--

00:36:45.292 --> 00:36:46.750 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: It looks
kind of raggedy.

00:36:46.750 --> 00:36:48.333 align:middle line:84%
It looks like she
has energy, but it's

00:36:48.333 --> 00:36:50.090 align:middle line:84%
kind of raggedy with
a couple little gaps,

00:36:50.090 --> 00:36:51.320 align:middle line:90%
a few gaps in there.

00:36:51.320 --> 00:36:52.220 align:middle line:90%
>>MCKENNA: Correct.

00:36:52.220 --> 00:36:53.413 align:middle line:90%
So down on the right femur--

00:36:53.413 --> 00:36:54.830 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Right
femur, which would

00:36:54.830 --> 00:36:57.197 align:middle line:84%
be on the left side
of our looking at her.

00:36:57.197 --> 00:36:59.030 align:middle line:84%
>>MCKENNA: Yeah, as if
she's looking at you.

00:36:59.030 --> 00:36:59.810 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes, exactly.

00:36:59.810 --> 00:37:01.460 align:middle line:84%
>>MCKENNA: You see
there's a gap there

00:37:01.460 --> 00:37:03.920 align:middle line:84%
right at the high
part of the femur.

00:37:03.920 --> 00:37:06.680 align:middle line:84%
This woman came to me
with a fear of falling.

00:37:06.680 --> 00:37:08.090 align:middle line:90%
And it was extreme.

00:37:08.090 --> 00:37:11.930 align:middle line:84%
So she was up 70s, 80s,
something like that.

00:37:11.930 --> 00:37:17.120 align:middle line:84%
I don't know the exact age, but
she looked physically capable.

00:37:17.120 --> 00:37:19.250 align:middle line:84%
But she was holding
onto everything

00:37:19.250 --> 00:37:20.360 align:middle line:90%
and looked very feeble.

00:37:20.360 --> 00:37:22.068 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Just kind
of clutching in fear.

00:37:22.068 --> 00:37:23.590 align:middle line:90%
>>MCKENNA: Clutching in fear.

00:37:23.590 --> 00:37:26.690 align:middle line:84%
And this woman told me, listen,
I'm so afraid of falling.

00:37:26.690 --> 00:37:28.490 align:middle line:90%
And it's ruining my life.

00:37:28.490 --> 00:37:30.470 align:middle line:90%
I'm just, I'm afraid of falling.

00:37:30.470 --> 00:37:35.510 align:middle line:84%
And she says, I fell down,
and I busted my femur.

00:37:35.510 --> 00:37:37.880 align:middle line:90%
And it was extremely painful.

00:37:37.880 --> 00:37:40.650 align:middle line:84%
Well, digging a
little bit deeper,

00:37:40.650 --> 00:37:45.470 align:middle line:84%
it turned out that
this woman was isolated

00:37:45.470 --> 00:37:50.600 align:middle line:84%
by one of her children, and
during the process was denied

00:37:50.600 --> 00:37:52.462 align:middle line:90%
medication, the painkillers.

00:37:52.462 --> 00:37:54.920 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: You mean while she
was recovering from the break?

00:37:54.920 --> 00:37:57.080 align:middle line:84%
>>MCKENNA: No, I mean, they
hadn't even done the surgery.

00:37:57.080 --> 00:37:58.070 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Oh, OK.

00:37:58.070 --> 00:38:00.320 align:middle line:84%
>>MCKENNA: And post
surgery as well.

00:38:00.320 --> 00:38:02.825 align:middle line:84%
So it was one of these kind
of tortured situations.

00:38:02.825 --> 00:38:04.193 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Oh, yikes.

00:38:04.193 --> 00:38:06.110 align:middle line:84%
>>MCKENNA: The child
taking its resentment out

00:38:06.110 --> 00:38:10.400 align:middle line:84%
on the parent when the
parent was incapacitated.

00:38:10.400 --> 00:38:11.703 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Vulnerable.

00:38:11.703 --> 00:38:12.620 align:middle line:90%
>>MCKENNA: Vulnerable.

00:38:12.620 --> 00:38:14.990 align:middle line:84%
And it was a torture
session, which

00:38:14.990 --> 00:38:18.892 align:middle line:84%
was horrible, because this
femur was busted like surgery.

00:38:18.892 --> 00:38:20.100 align:middle line:90%
It had to have surgery on it.

00:38:20.100 --> 00:38:21.517 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Well,
you can see, yeah.

00:38:21.517 --> 00:38:23.810 align:middle line:90%
It's broken in the aura there.

00:38:23.810 --> 00:38:25.820 align:middle line:90%
>>MCKENNA: This is years--

00:38:25.820 --> 00:38:29.930 align:middle line:84%
this was years after the
whole thing took place.

00:38:29.930 --> 00:38:33.380 align:middle line:84%
The energy is still all
jagged and like that.

00:38:33.380 --> 00:38:35.780 align:middle line:90%
So this woman busted her femur.

00:38:35.780 --> 00:38:41.030 align:middle line:84%
And during that process,
what ended up happening is

00:38:41.030 --> 00:38:45.410 align:middle line:84%
she was being caretaken by her
offspring, one of her children.

00:38:45.410 --> 00:38:48.020 align:middle line:84%
And this child abused
her during the process,

00:38:48.020 --> 00:38:52.880 align:middle line:84%
denied drugs, and was
controlling, and basically

00:38:52.880 --> 00:38:54.800 align:middle line:84%
had a situation where
it was like, you're

00:38:54.800 --> 00:38:55.810 align:middle line:90%
going to get it now.

00:38:55.810 --> 00:38:56.960 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Oh, yikes.

00:38:56.960 --> 00:38:58.760 align:middle line:90%
I mean, can you fathom?

00:38:58.760 --> 00:39:01.090 align:middle line:84%
I mean, imagine her
all those years later

00:39:01.090 --> 00:39:03.590 align:middle line:84%
and the terror of having to go
through that kind of betrayal

00:39:03.590 --> 00:39:06.890 align:middle line:84%
and trauma and such from
your own family member.

00:39:06.890 --> 00:39:08.460 align:middle line:84%
I'd be clutching
to everything too.

00:39:08.460 --> 00:39:09.260 align:middle line:90%
>>MCKENNA: Yeah.

00:39:09.260 --> 00:39:10.940 align:middle line:84%
It's like, do you want
this to happen again?

00:39:10.940 --> 00:39:12.732 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Exactly, all
buried in your body,

00:39:12.732 --> 00:39:15.485 align:middle line:84%
not even knowing why
you're clutching anymore.

00:39:15.485 --> 00:39:16.610 align:middle line:90%
>>MCKENNA: So there we are.

00:39:16.610 --> 00:39:19.670 align:middle line:84%
So I said, OK,
just feel the fear.

00:39:19.670 --> 00:39:20.900 align:middle line:90%
I want you to feel the fear.

00:39:20.900 --> 00:39:23.283 align:middle line:84%
Yes, you could end up
in that same situation.

00:39:23.283 --> 00:39:25.700 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And the energy is
still missing on the left side

00:39:25.700 --> 00:39:26.240 align:middle line:90%
of the picture--

00:39:26.240 --> 00:39:26.660 align:middle line:90%
>>MCKENNA: That's right.

00:39:26.660 --> 00:39:27.200 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: --her right femur.

00:39:27.200 --> 00:39:27.320 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:39:27.320 --> 00:39:28.120 align:middle line:90%
>>MCKENNA: Yeah.

00:39:28.120 --> 00:39:29.250 align:middle line:90%
And it didn't take much.

00:39:29.250 --> 00:39:31.450 align:middle line:90%
It only took about 20 minutes.

00:39:31.450 --> 00:39:34.650 align:middle line:84%
And we went through all the
different aspects of it.

00:39:34.650 --> 00:39:36.410 align:middle line:84%
And she says, oh,
it's just gone.

00:39:36.410 --> 00:39:38.430 align:middle line:84%
And she felt it
move in her body.

00:39:38.430 --> 00:39:39.230 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:39:39.230 --> 00:39:41.910 align:middle line:84%
>>MCKENNA: It moved right up,
the feeling, the sensation.

00:39:41.910 --> 00:39:42.710 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:39:42.710 --> 00:39:44.090 align:middle line:90%
>>MCKENNA: And it moved out.

00:39:44.090 --> 00:39:46.400 align:middle line:90%
And the fear went away.

00:39:46.400 --> 00:39:49.550 align:middle line:84%
And afterward, she's walking
around, not clutching

00:39:49.550 --> 00:39:51.485 align:middle line:84%
a damn thing, just
walking like--

00:39:51.485 --> 00:39:53.360 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Well, let's
look at the next image,

00:39:53.360 --> 00:39:55.170 align:middle line:84%
because you then did
the Bio-Well on her.

00:39:55.170 --> 00:39:56.200 align:middle line:84%
>>MCKENNA: Again,
yeah, yeah, yeah.

00:39:56.200 --> 00:39:57.350 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Now look at.

00:39:57.350 --> 00:39:58.680 align:middle line:90%
>>MCKENNA: It all filled in.

00:39:58.680 --> 00:39:59.720 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: All filled in.

00:39:59.720 --> 00:40:00.887 align:middle line:90%
>>MCKENNA: It all filled in.

00:40:00.887 --> 00:40:03.000 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: The energy became
vibrant in that area.

00:40:03.000 --> 00:40:03.800 align:middle line:90%
And not only that.

00:40:03.800 --> 00:40:06.150 align:middle line:84%
Around the rest of the aura,
it's not as jaggedy looking.

00:40:06.150 --> 00:40:06.950 align:middle line:90%
>>MCKENNA: Yeah.

00:40:06.950 --> 00:40:09.890 align:middle line:90%
That's what fear will do to you.

00:40:09.890 --> 00:40:14.420 align:middle line:84%
It's a really good
lesson for all of us.

00:40:14.420 --> 00:40:17.250 align:middle line:84%
You feel like the energy
lost when you're in fear.

00:40:17.250 --> 00:40:18.050 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:40:18.050 --> 00:40:19.310 align:middle line:84%
>>MCKENNA: You don't
feel much energy.

00:40:19.310 --> 00:40:21.070 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Yeah, like we
talked about earlier.

00:40:21.070 --> 00:40:21.440 align:middle line:90%
>>MCKENNA: Yeah.

00:40:21.440 --> 00:40:23.520 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: OK, let's go--
this is another one.

00:40:23.520 --> 00:40:26.150 align:middle line:84%
And this, I think, a lot
of people suffer from.

00:40:26.150 --> 00:40:30.260 align:middle line:84%
This is about the emotion of
forgiveness, before and afters.

00:40:30.260 --> 00:40:35.430 align:middle line:84%
>>MCKENNA: OK, yes, so
this person is actually me.

00:40:35.430 --> 00:40:38.310 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: [LAUGH] You
didn't tell me that.

00:40:38.310 --> 00:40:39.170 align:middle line:90%
>>MCKENNA: Yeah.

00:40:39.170 --> 00:40:41.870 align:middle line:84%
This one, I figured something
out around forgiveness.

00:40:41.870 --> 00:40:44.810 align:middle line:84%
So I was having some
digestion problems.

00:40:44.810 --> 00:40:47.780 align:middle line:84%
And here, you'll see
the energy center

00:40:47.780 --> 00:40:50.360 align:middle line:84%
down there in the lower
abdomen is way off.

00:40:50.360 --> 00:40:51.160 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:40:51.160 --> 00:40:53.870 align:middle line:84%
>>MCKENNA: And there were some
other reports that showed me

00:40:53.870 --> 00:40:57.080 align:middle line:84%
some areas of the body,
like around the legs, where

00:40:57.080 --> 00:41:01.780 align:middle line:84%
I had hurt myself when I was, I
think, maybe 16, 17 years old.

00:41:01.780 --> 00:41:04.790 align:middle line:84%
And I had suffered not
only breaking my leg,

00:41:04.790 --> 00:41:08.450 align:middle line:84%
but at the same point in time,
I felt my girlfriend betrayed me

00:41:08.450 --> 00:41:09.980 align:middle line:90%
or something like that.

00:41:09.980 --> 00:41:16.760 align:middle line:84%
And anyway, what happened is
because my digestion was off,

00:41:16.760 --> 00:41:17.810 align:middle line:90%
I took a reading.

00:41:17.810 --> 00:41:19.700 align:middle line:90%
And I saw all of this.

00:41:19.700 --> 00:41:21.710 align:middle line:84%
And I saw kind of
the gap in my aura

00:41:21.710 --> 00:41:26.070 align:middle line:84%
down where I broke my leg
when I was 17 or whatever.

00:41:26.070 --> 00:41:27.920 align:middle line:84%
And I was like, oh
my gosh, that was

00:41:27.920 --> 00:41:32.540 align:middle line:84%
the time when I really
had this resentment

00:41:32.540 --> 00:41:33.950 align:middle line:90%
towards those people.

00:41:33.950 --> 00:41:36.200 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Being dumped by
your girlfriend or whatever.

00:41:36.200 --> 00:41:37.910 align:middle line:90%
>>MCKENNA: Being dumped, yeah--

00:41:37.910 --> 00:41:39.200 align:middle line:90%
teenage thing.

00:41:39.200 --> 00:41:44.060 align:middle line:84%
And so anyway, I was like,
oh, I'll just forgive.

00:41:44.060 --> 00:41:46.310 align:middle line:84%
I haven't thought
about that in 40 years.

00:41:46.310 --> 00:41:48.230 align:middle line:84%
What the heck is
that coming up for?

00:41:48.230 --> 00:41:50.690 align:middle line:84%
I forgave, and then
this is what happened.

00:41:50.690 --> 00:41:51.860 align:middle line:90%
Look at this.

00:41:51.860 --> 00:41:52.190 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Oh my.

00:41:52.190 --> 00:41:52.990 align:middle line:90%
Look at that.

00:41:52.990 --> 00:41:54.605 align:middle line:90%
Everything's all lined up.

00:41:54.605 --> 00:41:55.730 align:middle line:90%
>>MCKENNA: And that-- yeah.

00:41:55.730 --> 00:41:57.647 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And what
happened to your digestion?

00:41:57.647 --> 00:41:59.330 align:middle line:84%
>>MCKENNA: Oh, it
helped the digestion.

00:41:59.330 --> 00:42:01.040 align:middle line:84%
Not only did it
help the digestion,

00:42:01.040 --> 00:42:06.080 align:middle line:84%
but for me to forgive,
it's very fast for me.

00:42:06.080 --> 00:42:09.920 align:middle line:84%
And so that was only
like three minutes.

00:42:09.920 --> 00:42:11.530 align:middle line:84%
And then I just put
my finger back in.

00:42:11.530 --> 00:42:12.330 align:middle line:90%
Pop.

00:42:12.330 --> 00:42:14.370 align:middle line:90%
And I was like, ha, ha, ha.

00:42:14.370 --> 00:42:15.897 align:middle line:90%
And the energy field returned--

00:42:15.897 --> 00:42:16.730 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: I love it.

00:42:16.730 --> 00:42:17.980 align:middle line:84%
>>MCKENNA: --around
my leg and everything.

00:42:17.980 --> 00:42:18.813 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: I love it.

00:42:18.813 --> 00:42:20.660 align:middle line:90%
>>MCKENNA: It's so funny.

00:42:20.660 --> 00:42:23.360 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Can a person go
back to the first betrayal

00:42:23.360 --> 00:42:26.330 align:middle line:84%
that they can remember
in their lifetime?

00:42:26.330 --> 00:42:28.010 align:middle line:84%
Can they go back
to that betrayal?

00:42:28.010 --> 00:42:29.810 align:middle line:84%
Because that
betrayal obviously is

00:42:29.810 --> 00:42:32.030 align:middle line:84%
stuck in the subconscious
from that point forward.

00:42:32.030 --> 00:42:33.710 align:middle line:84%
And it's going to
dictate how they

00:42:33.710 --> 00:42:36.040 align:middle line:84%
respond to future
potential betrayals, right?

00:42:36.040 --> 00:42:36.840 align:middle line:90%
>>MCKENNA: Yes.

00:42:36.840 --> 00:42:39.530 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Can you go back
and work on the first one

00:42:39.530 --> 00:42:42.510 align:middle line:84%
and have that have a knock-on
effect of healing the others?

00:42:42.510 --> 00:42:43.310 align:middle line:90%
>>MCKENNA: It does.

00:42:43.310 --> 00:42:47.960 align:middle line:84%
It does have a knock-on
effect of healing.

00:42:47.960 --> 00:42:51.140 align:middle line:84%
When we work on
anything, especially

00:42:51.140 --> 00:42:54.890 align:middle line:84%
those early, early memories
that were fairly traumatic,

00:42:54.890 --> 00:43:00.170 align:middle line:84%
it can really affect
everything after that.

00:43:00.170 --> 00:43:02.900 align:middle line:84%
We've had so many
things about this

00:43:02.900 --> 00:43:04.310 align:middle line:90%
that we've kind of learned.

00:43:04.310 --> 00:43:06.320 align:middle line:84%
And one of the things
that we learned

00:43:06.320 --> 00:43:09.950 align:middle line:84%
is that maybe for
me, forgiveness,

00:43:09.950 --> 00:43:12.410 align:middle line:90%
because I had some experiences.

00:43:12.410 --> 00:43:13.910 align:middle line:84%
Now I know it's in
my best interest.

00:43:13.910 --> 00:43:14.710 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:43:14.710 --> 00:43:16.520 align:middle line:84%
>>MCKENNA: So now it's
become easy for me

00:43:16.520 --> 00:43:20.000 align:middle line:84%
because I know that's
in my best interest.

00:43:20.000 --> 00:43:25.190 align:middle line:84%
But for most of us
is that forgiveness,

00:43:25.190 --> 00:43:28.250 align:middle line:84%
we might say we're forgiving
them, but we really don't.

00:43:28.250 --> 00:43:29.980 align:middle line:90%
We hold it in our bodies.

00:43:29.980 --> 00:43:32.690 align:middle line:90%
We're like, yeah, I forgive you.

00:43:32.690 --> 00:43:35.630 align:middle line:90%
But [GRUNT] if I could, right?

00:43:35.630 --> 00:43:38.370 align:middle line:84%
You still have
feelings around it.

00:43:38.370 --> 00:43:41.960 align:middle line:84%
And so when we
have these, they're

00:43:41.960 --> 00:43:44.030 align:middle line:84%
stuck in our energy
field like WE

00:43:44.030 --> 00:43:49.880 align:middle line:84%
talked about before in our body,
is I can't help how I feel.

00:43:49.880 --> 00:43:53.960 align:middle line:84%
So what we do is we
actually allow the person

00:43:53.960 --> 00:43:59.640 align:middle line:84%
to feel the present completely
and do the Cognomovement, which

00:43:59.640 --> 00:44:03.900 align:middle line:84%
basically helps it to
literally move out of the body.

00:44:03.900 --> 00:44:09.070 align:middle line:84%
And forgiveness becomes easy
if I don't feel anything.

00:44:09.070 --> 00:44:13.390 align:middle line:84%
Imagine who you don't feel
anything about what they did,

00:44:13.390 --> 00:44:14.370 align:middle line:90%
well, do I forgive you?

00:44:14.370 --> 00:44:14.790 align:middle line:90%
Of course.

00:44:14.790 --> 00:44:15.707 align:middle line:90%
I don't feel anything.

00:44:15.707 --> 00:44:16.507 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:44:16.507 --> 00:44:17.380 align:middle line:90%
>>MCKENNA: Right?

00:44:17.380 --> 00:44:18.385 align:middle line:90%
What's to forgive?

00:44:18.385 --> 00:44:20.760 align:middle line:84%
There's nothing to forgive
because I don't feel anything.

00:44:20.760 --> 00:44:23.460 align:middle line:90%


00:44:23.460 --> 00:44:27.180 align:middle line:84%
There was an amazing
one on a woman,

00:44:27.180 --> 00:44:29.820 align:middle line:84%
and she was going to leave
her husband and the resentment

00:44:29.820 --> 00:44:30.837 align:middle line:90%
towards her husband.

00:44:30.837 --> 00:44:32.670 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: OK, tell us
what we're looking at.

00:44:32.670 --> 00:44:34.530 align:middle line:10%
We have the green
and the blue stacks

00:44:34.530 --> 00:44:36.238 align:middle line:10%
and then the ones that
are more shadowed.

00:44:36.238 --> 00:44:38.160 align:middle line:84%
>>MCKENNA: So this
one, I love this story

00:44:38.160 --> 00:44:43.110 align:middle line:84%
because it saved a whole family
and three kids, maybe four.

00:44:43.110 --> 00:44:45.000 align:middle line:84%
I think it was
three or four kids.

00:44:45.000 --> 00:44:48.180 align:middle line:84%
So this woman comes to
me, and she said, listen,

00:44:48.180 --> 00:44:49.980 align:middle line:90%
I'm going to leave my husband.

00:44:49.980 --> 00:44:53.820 align:middle line:84%
She has a lot of
resentment, very angry--

00:44:53.820 --> 00:44:55.630 align:middle line:90%
very, very angry.

00:44:55.630 --> 00:44:58.740 align:middle line:90%
And I said, OK, all right, fine.

00:44:58.740 --> 00:45:00.480 align:middle line:84%
Let's just take a
reading here and see

00:45:00.480 --> 00:45:05.430 align:middle line:84%
what I can do to help you
at least to move forward.

00:45:05.430 --> 00:45:07.620 align:middle line:90%
And so we take the reading.

00:45:07.620 --> 00:45:10.530 align:middle line:10%
And here you'll
see at the bottom

00:45:10.530 --> 00:45:13.180 align:middle line:10%
it shows 30 different organs.

00:45:13.180 --> 00:45:16.170 align:middle line:10%
Now across the entire
thing, all this graph

00:45:16.170 --> 00:45:20.280 align:middle line:10%
is every single organ,
that 31 different organs.

00:45:20.280 --> 00:45:23.250 align:middle line:84%
And the different
colors are left, right.

00:45:23.250 --> 00:45:27.600 align:middle line:84%
So each column has a left,
right that's sympathetic,

00:45:27.600 --> 00:45:28.590 align:middle line:90%
parasympathetic.

00:45:28.590 --> 00:45:29.390 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: OK.

00:45:29.390 --> 00:45:33.600 align:middle line:10%
>>MCKENNA: Over to the left-hand
side is the amount of joules.

00:45:33.600 --> 00:45:35.680 align:middle line:10%
This is joules of energy.

00:45:35.680 --> 00:45:39.570 align:middle line:10%
So this is really
important because you know

00:45:39.570 --> 00:45:41.510 align:middle line:10%
the work of Dr. Jerry Tennant.

00:45:41.510 --> 00:45:42.310 align:middle line:90%
You had on him--

00:45:42.310 --> 00:45:42.540 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:45:42.540 --> 00:45:43.748 align:middle line:90%
>>MCKENNA: --electric health.

00:45:43.748 --> 00:45:44.640 align:middle line:90%
Wonderful man.

00:45:44.640 --> 00:45:45.870 align:middle line:90%
He went to Harvard.

00:45:45.870 --> 00:45:52.800 align:middle line:84%
And he gave me the idea around
actual electricity in the body

00:45:52.800 --> 00:45:55.880 align:middle line:90%
and that we have--

00:45:55.880 --> 00:46:00.190 align:middle line:84%
the less lower voltage means
less health and greater

00:46:00.190 --> 00:46:01.590 align:middle line:90%
voltage, greater health.

00:46:01.590 --> 00:46:04.230 align:middle line:84%
So here with the
Bio-Well, we can actually

00:46:04.230 --> 00:46:07.172 align:middle line:84%
tell the electrical charge
of every single organ.

00:46:07.172 --> 00:46:08.380 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: That's crazy, yeah.

00:46:08.380 --> 00:46:11.880 align:middle line:10%
>>MCKENNA: So over to the
left, so here you can see all

00:46:11.880 --> 00:46:16.200 align:middle line:10%
the energy that is in
every single organ,

00:46:16.200 --> 00:46:20.182 align:middle line:10%
in which the organs that
are off balance, meaning--

00:46:20.182 --> 00:46:21.390 align:middle line:10%
>>REGINA: The left and right.

00:46:21.390 --> 00:46:24.600 align:middle line:10%
>>MCKENNA: --left and right,
those ones are highlighted.

00:46:24.600 --> 00:46:26.040 align:middle line:10%
Those ones are highlighted.

00:46:26.040 --> 00:46:28.360 align:middle line:84%
So over the course
of a few hours--

00:46:28.360 --> 00:46:29.880 align:middle line:90%
this was a real severe case.

00:46:29.880 --> 00:46:32.550 align:middle line:84%
Over the course of a few hours,
I worked with this woman,

00:46:32.550 --> 00:46:34.680 align:middle line:84%
and I just had her feel
all the resentments

00:46:34.680 --> 00:46:36.690 align:middle line:90%
towards her husband.

00:46:36.690 --> 00:46:42.990 align:middle line:84%
And not only were we able to
vacate those out of her body,

00:46:42.990 --> 00:46:46.050 align:middle line:84%
but not only that,
but we got her

00:46:46.050 --> 00:46:52.210 align:middle line:84%
to the point of feeling
love, real love for him.

00:46:52.210 --> 00:46:53.970 align:middle line:90%
I call it Cognopositive.

00:46:53.970 --> 00:46:54.810 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:46:54.810 --> 00:47:00.150 align:middle line:84%
>>MCKENNA: If you actually feel
the love and do the movement,

00:47:00.150 --> 00:47:01.090 align:middle line:90%
watch what happens.

00:47:01.090 --> 00:47:01.590 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And this
is what happened.

00:47:01.590 --> 00:47:04.140 align:middle line:10%
Just one organ left
that was out of balance.

00:47:04.140 --> 00:47:05.960 align:middle line:84%
>>MCKENNA: But look
at the difference.

00:47:05.960 --> 00:47:06.760 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:47:06.760 --> 00:47:09.270 align:middle line:84%
>>MCKENNA: The amount of
energy is double, right?

00:47:09.270 --> 00:47:10.470 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah, huge.

00:47:10.470 --> 00:47:14.010 align:middle line:84%
>>MCKENNA: So when people
have this doubling of energy,

00:47:14.010 --> 00:47:17.550 align:middle line:84%
it literally means that the
electricity in the body is

00:47:17.550 --> 00:47:21.420 align:middle line:84%
greater, and you have
more vibrant energy--

00:47:21.420 --> 00:47:24.290 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Available to you
to use in positive ways and--

00:47:24.290 --> 00:47:25.090 align:middle line:90%
>>MCKENNA: Yes.

00:47:25.090 --> 00:47:25.590 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:47:25.590 --> 00:47:27.257 align:middle line:84%
>>MCKENNA: And you're
not tired anymore.

00:47:27.257 --> 00:47:28.230 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:47:28.230 --> 00:47:31.860 align:middle line:84%
>>MCKENNA: How many husbands and
wives are dragging themselves

00:47:31.860 --> 00:47:33.450 align:middle line:90%
home and, I'm so tired.

00:47:33.450 --> 00:47:34.830 align:middle line:90%
I'm so tired.

00:47:34.830 --> 00:47:36.600 align:middle line:90%
You know why you're so tired?

00:47:36.600 --> 00:47:38.430 align:middle line:90%
Is because of this.

00:47:38.430 --> 00:47:40.500 align:middle line:90%
Your energy is depleted.

00:47:40.500 --> 00:47:41.660 align:middle line:90%
And why is it depleted?

00:47:41.660 --> 00:47:45.420 align:middle line:84%
It's because of all of
these experiences in life

00:47:45.420 --> 00:47:47.610 align:middle line:84%
that have been
stacked up that you're

00:47:47.610 --> 00:47:52.890 align:middle line:84%
resenting or not able to
process the events of life.

00:47:52.890 --> 00:47:55.920 align:middle line:84%
It was such a
wonderful story that I

00:47:55.920 --> 00:48:00.540 align:middle line:84%
worked with a lot of
people of all ages.

00:48:00.540 --> 00:48:04.140 align:middle line:84%
But in some of the workshops
that I do that go on

00:48:04.140 --> 00:48:07.680 align:middle line:84%
for an extended period
of time, there's

00:48:07.680 --> 00:48:10.710 align:middle line:90%
women that are in there, 75.

00:48:10.710 --> 00:48:15.900 align:middle line:84%
And they've gone from I'm
so tired and bedraggled

00:48:15.900 --> 00:48:21.420 align:middle line:84%
and everything to they
are like sleeping--

00:48:21.420 --> 00:48:24.180 align:middle line:84%
they've cut their sleep
in half, and they're

00:48:24.180 --> 00:48:25.730 align:middle line:90%
so happy and vibrant.

00:48:25.730 --> 00:48:28.160 align:middle line:84%
And it's coming out
in the strangest ways.

00:48:28.160 --> 00:48:29.868 align:middle line:84%
It's like they're
teenagers or something.

00:48:29.868 --> 00:48:30.668 align:middle line:90%
They're like--

00:48:30.668 --> 00:48:32.356 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Oh, you
mean they were lonely.

00:48:32.356 --> 00:48:36.210 align:middle line:84%
>>MCKENNA: Oh, they want a
boyfriend, and they're like,

00:48:36.210 --> 00:48:40.500 align:middle line:84%
all my shame is gone, and
all the guilt of a lifetime.

00:48:40.500 --> 00:48:42.690 align:middle line:84%
And they're like-- they're
getting boyfriends.

00:48:42.690 --> 00:48:43.562 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHTER]

00:48:43.562 --> 00:48:45.040 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: I love it.

00:48:45.040 --> 00:48:45.840 align:middle line:90%
Oh my god.

00:48:45.840 --> 00:48:49.183 align:middle line:84%
Well, let's talk about this
because I've known you since--

00:48:49.183 --> 00:48:50.850 align:middle line:84%
well, from the beginning
of this, right?

00:48:50.850 --> 00:48:51.650 align:middle line:90%
>>MCKENNA: Yeah.

00:48:51.650 --> 00:48:53.190 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And
watched you evolve.

00:48:53.190 --> 00:48:56.260 align:middle line:84%
And you used to spend
some of your time

00:48:56.260 --> 00:48:59.530 align:middle line:84%
going down and helping work
with people that were homeless.

00:48:59.530 --> 00:49:02.260 align:middle line:84%
And you really just kind
of put yourself out there

00:49:02.260 --> 00:49:04.660 align:middle line:90%
to see what this could do.

00:49:04.660 --> 00:49:07.330 align:middle line:84%
And over the years, it's
evolved into this much more

00:49:07.330 --> 00:49:09.490 align:middle line:90%
refined, now, practice.

00:49:09.490 --> 00:49:14.170 align:middle line:90%
So you offer online classes.

00:49:14.170 --> 00:49:16.780 align:middle line:84%
If you're not lucky enough,
like I am, to sit here with you

00:49:16.780 --> 00:49:18.760 align:middle line:84%
and say, hey,
let's do a session,

00:49:18.760 --> 00:49:21.095 align:middle line:84%
how do people connect,
then, with what you do?

00:49:21.095 --> 00:49:23.470 align:middle line:84%
Because I know you're now
certifying other practitioners.

00:49:23.470 --> 00:49:27.010 align:middle line:84%
So how do people get
Cognomovement into their lives?

00:49:27.010 --> 00:49:29.200 align:middle line:90%
>>MCKENNA: Oh, gosh.

00:49:29.200 --> 00:49:31.630 align:middle line:84%
So, yeah, things
have so expanded.

00:49:31.630 --> 00:49:35.170 align:middle line:84%
We have doctors and
therapists and psychologists

00:49:35.170 --> 00:49:35.970 align:middle line:90%
and everybody's--

00:49:35.970 --> 00:49:36.186 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: I know.

00:49:36.186 --> 00:49:38.350 align:middle line:84%
It's crazy the last few
years it's exploded.

00:49:38.350 --> 00:49:39.160 align:middle line:90%
>>MCKENNA: Oh yeah.

00:49:39.160 --> 00:49:40.850 align:middle line:84%
And it's attacking
the problem from

00:49:40.850 --> 00:49:42.100 align:middle line:90%
a whole different perspective.

00:49:42.100 --> 00:49:43.120 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:49:43.120 --> 00:49:45.560 align:middle line:84%
>>MCKENNA: So you're applying
the body to the problem.

00:49:45.560 --> 00:49:46.360 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:49:46.360 --> 00:49:47.160 align:middle line:90%
>>MCKENNA: Right?

00:49:47.160 --> 00:49:49.940 align:middle line:90%
And it's fast, and it's easy.

00:49:49.940 --> 00:49:52.478 align:middle line:84%
So the way that
they can connect is

00:49:52.478 --> 00:49:54.520 align:middle line:84%
if they're interested in
becoming a practitioner,

00:49:54.520 --> 00:49:57.010 align:middle line:84%
we have practitioner
certification programs,

00:49:57.010 --> 00:50:00.550 align:middle line:84%
where they learn all of
these things about the eyes

00:50:00.550 --> 00:50:03.940 align:middle line:84%
and what's not happening
and how to help them

00:50:03.940 --> 00:50:06.110 align:middle line:90%
make it happen for a person.

00:50:06.110 --> 00:50:08.780 align:middle line:84%
So we have a
certification around that.

00:50:08.780 --> 00:50:13.120 align:middle line:84%
We have all kinds of
classes that are ongoing,

00:50:13.120 --> 00:50:15.490 align:middle line:84%
classes that you can
join and seminars.

00:50:15.490 --> 00:50:21.550 align:middle line:84%
Plus we have-- basically it's
like online courses that go on.

00:50:21.550 --> 00:50:23.950 align:middle line:84%
They're beyond
training, beyond just

00:50:23.950 --> 00:50:25.630 align:middle line:90%
learning how to do the basics.

00:50:25.630 --> 00:50:30.130 align:middle line:84%
But we found that in order
for people to really elevate

00:50:30.130 --> 00:50:34.330 align:middle line:84%
themselves to this whole new
level, where they're just like,

00:50:34.330 --> 00:50:36.850 align:middle line:90%
I am no longer affected.

00:50:36.850 --> 00:50:38.420 align:middle line:90%
My suffering is optional.

00:50:38.420 --> 00:50:40.060 align:middle line:90%
They're no longer suffering.

00:50:40.060 --> 00:50:42.700 align:middle line:84%
You need to go at it
for a period of time.

00:50:42.700 --> 00:50:44.680 align:middle line:84%
You have to sign up
for a course and just

00:50:44.680 --> 00:50:49.700 align:middle line:84%
keep going and attacking other
different parts of your life.

00:50:49.700 --> 00:50:53.680 align:middle line:84%
And when you do that, you just
stop reacting to anything.

00:50:53.680 --> 00:50:55.660 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So you just
take one issue at a time,

00:50:55.660 --> 00:50:58.070 align:middle line:84%
one feeling at a time,
and you work it through--

00:50:58.070 --> 00:50:58.180 align:middle line:90%
>>MCKENNA: Yeah.

00:50:58.180 --> 00:50:59.770 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: --till that
part has liberated itself

00:50:59.770 --> 00:51:00.610 align:middle line:90%
from your body.

00:51:00.610 --> 00:51:01.120 align:middle line:90%
>>MCKENNA: Yes.

00:51:01.120 --> 00:51:01.510 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: OK.

00:51:01.510 --> 00:51:03.635 align:middle line:84%
And then it's like, oops,
there's this other thing.

00:51:03.635 --> 00:51:05.080 align:middle line:90%
I'll go work on that again.

00:51:05.080 --> 00:51:07.480 align:middle line:84%
And you work through till
each of the major things that

00:51:07.480 --> 00:51:10.300 align:middle line:84%
have haunted you, so to
speak, are eliminated

00:51:10.300 --> 00:51:13.180 align:middle line:84%
from what appears to be the
physical, which is actually

00:51:13.180 --> 00:51:14.347 align:middle line:90%
much more than the physical.

00:51:14.347 --> 00:51:15.263 align:middle line:90%
>>MCKENNA: Absolutely.

00:51:15.263 --> 00:51:17.330 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: It's healing
the subconscious, really.

00:51:17.330 --> 00:51:18.130 align:middle line:90%
>>MCKENNA: Correct.

00:51:18.130 --> 00:51:18.930 align:middle line:90%
We are.

00:51:18.930 --> 00:51:20.590 align:middle line:84%
We're vacating it
from the body--

00:51:20.590 --> 00:51:20.800 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:51:20.800 --> 00:51:21.295 align:middle line:84%
>>MCKENNA: --and
the subconscious.

00:51:21.295 --> 00:51:22.095 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:51:22.095 --> 00:51:25.690 align:middle line:84%
>>MCKENNA: And so they literally
don't have a reaction anymore.

00:51:25.690 --> 00:51:27.170 align:middle line:90%
It's a fairly simple process.

00:51:27.170 --> 00:51:31.240 align:middle line:84%
But what we do is we'll take
a subject like victimization.

00:51:31.240 --> 00:51:36.040 align:middle line:84%
And inside victimization is
grief, is shame, is blame.

00:51:36.040 --> 00:51:38.950 align:middle line:84%
Maybe some revenge
would go in there.

00:51:38.950 --> 00:51:40.900 align:middle line:84%
Whatever it might
be, and we just

00:51:40.900 --> 00:51:44.200 align:middle line:84%
attack it from all those
angles and really clear it out.

00:51:44.200 --> 00:51:47.560 align:middle line:90%
And we work on manifesting.

00:51:47.560 --> 00:51:52.150 align:middle line:84%
Because what happens
is, if you imagine,

00:51:52.150 --> 00:51:55.810 align:middle line:84%
there's a whole different
positive aspect of this.

00:51:55.810 --> 00:51:59.980 align:middle line:84%
If I can align both halves of
your hemisphere of your brain

00:51:59.980 --> 00:52:03.370 align:middle line:84%
and align your entire
chakra system, your energy

00:52:03.370 --> 00:52:07.660 align:middle line:84%
system, and both are
all focused on one goal,

00:52:07.660 --> 00:52:09.320 align:middle line:90%
amazing things happen.

00:52:09.320 --> 00:52:12.730 align:middle line:84%
We have people getting
married and buying houses

00:52:12.730 --> 00:52:13.772 align:middle line:90%
and financially changing.

00:52:13.772 --> 00:52:15.938 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Oh, yeah, the
coherence that would happen.

00:52:15.938 --> 00:52:18.040 align:middle line:84%
Not just coherence,
but the lack of leakage

00:52:18.040 --> 00:52:19.930 align:middle line:90%
of energy every which way.

00:52:19.930 --> 00:52:22.800 align:middle line:84%
To have it available
and, like you say, focus

00:52:22.800 --> 00:52:25.390 align:middle line:90%
it into a desired outcome--

00:52:25.390 --> 00:52:26.250 align:middle line:90%
>>MCKENNA: Oh.

00:52:26.250 --> 00:52:27.050 align:middle line:90%
It's--

00:52:27.050 --> 00:52:28.510 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Pretty potent stuff.

00:52:28.510 --> 00:52:29.800 align:middle line:90%
>>MCKENNA: It is.

00:52:29.800 --> 00:52:31.880 align:middle line:90%
I'll tell you this story.

00:52:31.880 --> 00:52:33.020 align:middle line:90%
I had a guy.

00:52:33.020 --> 00:52:37.910 align:middle line:84%
He's the parent of an adult
child come to me and says,

00:52:37.910 --> 00:52:43.870 align:middle line:84%
listen, my son, he said,
it's not a matter of if, dad.

00:52:43.870 --> 00:52:45.640 align:middle line:90%
It's a matter of when.

00:52:45.640 --> 00:52:46.903 align:middle line:90%
I'm going to do it.

00:52:46.903 --> 00:52:48.070 align:middle line:90%
I'm going to commit suicide.

00:52:48.070 --> 00:52:48.760 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:52:48.760 --> 00:52:50.680 align:middle line:84%
>>MCKENNA: I've tried
all your psychologists.

00:52:50.680 --> 00:52:51.710 align:middle line:90%
I've tried everything.

00:52:51.710 --> 00:52:53.752 align:middle line:84%
I've tried this, that,
and the other thing, drugs

00:52:53.752 --> 00:52:54.850 align:middle line:90%
and what have you.

00:52:54.850 --> 00:52:56.200 align:middle line:90%
And I'm just done.

00:52:56.200 --> 00:52:59.760 align:middle line:84%
And you can try to throw me in
an institution or something.

00:52:59.760 --> 00:53:02.470 align:middle line:90%
But I'm just going to do it.

00:53:02.470 --> 00:53:07.640 align:middle line:84%
And so he comes to me and he
says the kid was telling him,

00:53:07.640 --> 00:53:09.990 align:middle line:84%
I just need to work
up the courage, dad.

00:53:09.990 --> 00:53:10.790 align:middle line:90%
So that's--

00:53:10.790 --> 00:53:12.390 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So you
worked with the kid?

00:53:12.390 --> 00:53:13.190 align:middle line:90%
>>MCKENNA: Yeah.

00:53:13.190 --> 00:53:15.950 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And what was the
key thing you worked on?

00:53:15.950 --> 00:53:19.040 align:middle line:84%
>>MCKENNA: Well, it was
actually over three days.

00:53:19.040 --> 00:53:21.080 align:middle line:84%
It was kind of one of
these things that was--

00:53:21.080 --> 00:53:21.980 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: A marathon.

00:53:21.980 --> 00:53:23.070 align:middle line:90%
>>MCKENNA: --a marathon.

00:53:23.070 --> 00:53:26.770 align:middle line:84%
And I said, I'm not
going to give up on this.

00:53:26.770 --> 00:53:30.570 align:middle line:84%
Because this person
I needed to help.

00:53:30.570 --> 00:53:32.330 align:middle line:90%
So we did it.

00:53:32.330 --> 00:53:37.160 align:middle line:84%
And I said, part time each
day, I'm going to come in,

00:53:37.160 --> 00:53:39.290 align:middle line:84%
and we're going to
do a different thing.

00:53:39.290 --> 00:53:43.070 align:middle line:84%
And we just went through
resentment towards the parents,

00:53:43.070 --> 00:53:45.047 align:middle line:84%
because those are
primary relationships,

00:53:45.047 --> 00:53:46.130 align:middle line:90%
and we've got to fix that.

00:53:46.130 --> 00:53:47.850 align:middle line:90%
So we did that.

00:53:47.850 --> 00:53:52.610 align:middle line:84%
And one by one, it
vacated, one by one.

00:53:52.610 --> 00:53:55.550 align:middle line:84%
And he was a person that
really felt things, physically.

00:53:55.550 --> 00:53:56.570 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah, yeah.

00:53:56.570 --> 00:53:59.930 align:middle line:84%
>>MCKENNA: When he got a
release, he was like, ahh!

00:53:59.930 --> 00:54:03.410 align:middle line:84%
And he had pain in his hands,
and it was very intense

00:54:03.410 --> 00:54:04.650 align:middle line:90%
for him.

00:54:04.650 --> 00:54:08.150 align:middle line:84%
So that was kind of
the setup of his body.

00:54:08.150 --> 00:54:10.970 align:middle line:84%
After three days,
there was nothing left.

00:54:10.970 --> 00:54:12.995 align:middle line:90%
He was like, I am at peace.

00:54:12.995 --> 00:54:14.743 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Wow.

00:54:14.743 --> 00:54:15.910 align:middle line:90%
>>MCKENNA: There is nothing.

00:54:15.910 --> 00:54:17.120 align:middle line:90%
No, I'm not going to do it.

00:54:17.120 --> 00:54:18.440 align:middle line:90%
I'm fine.

00:54:18.440 --> 00:54:20.480 align:middle line:90%
And he was.

00:54:20.480 --> 00:54:22.040 align:middle line:90%
But I had scheduled up--

00:54:22.040 --> 00:54:24.360 align:middle line:90%
because the guy--

00:54:24.360 --> 00:54:29.750 align:middle line:84%
I said, well, I was on my
way there the fourth day.

00:54:29.750 --> 00:54:33.170 align:middle line:84%
And the fourth day, I'm on
the road, and it hit me.

00:54:33.170 --> 00:54:35.780 align:middle line:84%
I got nothing else
for this guy to clear.

00:54:35.780 --> 00:54:36.868 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:54:36.868 --> 00:54:37.910 align:middle line:90%
>>MCKENNA: And it hit me.

00:54:37.910 --> 00:54:38.930 align:middle line:90%
You know what?

00:54:38.930 --> 00:54:41.720 align:middle line:90%
Let's turn this thing around.

00:54:41.720 --> 00:54:44.390 align:middle line:84%
And what we did is I
said, you know what?

00:54:44.390 --> 00:54:49.250 align:middle line:84%
Imagine that you have
now a credit card.

00:54:49.250 --> 00:54:51.470 align:middle line:84%
Imagine that you have
money in your bank account.

00:54:51.470 --> 00:54:53.640 align:middle line:90%
Imagine you have a job.

00:54:53.640 --> 00:54:55.550 align:middle line:84%
Imagine that you now
have a new house,

00:54:55.550 --> 00:54:59.840 align:middle line:84%
and your son, who you
can't support, loves you

00:54:59.840 --> 00:55:02.390 align:middle line:84%
and you're living
with him in the house.

00:55:02.390 --> 00:55:06.650 align:middle line:84%
And imagine that you've got all
those things of the material

00:55:06.650 --> 00:55:09.390 align:middle line:84%
world that you need
to have a great life.

00:55:09.390 --> 00:55:12.020 align:middle line:84%
And the people at
your job love you.

00:55:12.020 --> 00:55:13.130 align:middle line:90%
So I went one by one.

00:55:13.130 --> 00:55:15.265 align:middle line:84%
I'm doing
Cognomovement with him.

00:55:15.265 --> 00:55:16.640 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: With
the good feelings.

00:55:16.640 --> 00:55:18.057 align:middle line:84%
>>MCKENNA: With
the good feelings.

00:55:18.057 --> 00:55:20.060 align:middle line:84%
And I'm supporting him
in the good feelings.

00:55:20.060 --> 00:55:24.380 align:middle line:84%
And it was the craziest
thing that happened.

00:55:24.380 --> 00:55:27.350 align:middle line:90%
I'm there, and we're doing it.

00:55:27.350 --> 00:55:29.097 align:middle line:90%
And it's about seven minutes in.

00:55:29.097 --> 00:55:30.680 align:middle line:84%
And, yeah, you've
got the credit card.

00:55:30.680 --> 00:55:33.890 align:middle line:84%
Oh my god, you just put the
down payment on the new house.

00:55:33.890 --> 00:55:34.860 align:middle line:90%
Oh my god.

00:55:34.860 --> 00:55:36.270 align:middle line:90%
Da, da, da, da.

00:55:36.270 --> 00:55:40.300 align:middle line:84%
All of a sudden it was seven
minutes in and it was, [GRUNT]..

00:55:40.300 --> 00:55:42.110 align:middle line:90%
And he was there and he froze.

00:55:42.110 --> 00:55:44.510 align:middle line:84%
And the look on his
face was like, [SHRIEK]..

00:55:44.510 --> 00:55:46.190 align:middle line:90%
And I was like, oh, my--

00:55:46.190 --> 00:55:47.300 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: What happened?

00:55:47.300 --> 00:55:48.600 align:middle line:90%
>>MCKENNA: I was like, oh, 911.

00:55:48.600 --> 00:55:49.400 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:55:49.400 --> 00:55:50.442 align:middle line:90%
>>MCKENNA: I was worried.

00:55:50.442 --> 00:55:52.590 align:middle line:84%
I was like, I've never
seen this before.

00:55:52.590 --> 00:55:53.670 align:middle line:90%
What?

00:55:53.670 --> 00:55:56.130 align:middle line:90%
And he goes, [GROAN].

00:55:56.130 --> 00:55:58.380 align:middle line:90%
And then he dropped the ball.

00:55:58.380 --> 00:55:59.460 align:middle line:90%
And I was like, oh, boy.

00:55:59.460 --> 00:56:00.870 align:middle line:84%
We're going to have
to call an ambulance.

00:56:00.870 --> 00:56:02.245 align:middle line:84%
And then finally
he was like, ah.

00:56:02.245 --> 00:56:04.615 align:middle line:90%


00:56:04.615 --> 00:56:06.020 align:middle line:90%
I said, what happened?

00:56:06.020 --> 00:56:06.820 align:middle line:90%
He said, I'm OK.

00:56:06.820 --> 00:56:08.400 align:middle line:90%
I'm all right.

00:56:08.400 --> 00:56:13.620 align:middle line:84%
He said that he felt
what he could only

00:56:13.620 --> 00:56:16.030 align:middle line:90%
describe as a full-body orgasm.

00:56:16.030 --> 00:56:16.830 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Orgasm.

00:56:16.830 --> 00:56:18.270 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHTER]

00:56:18.270 --> 00:56:19.230 align:middle line:90%
I love it.

00:56:19.230 --> 00:56:22.590 align:middle line:90%


00:56:22.590 --> 00:56:25.710 align:middle line:84%
Well, I have to ask this
because we're out of time.

00:56:25.710 --> 00:56:29.550 align:middle line:84%
Is it just the magic of Bill
that's making this happen?

00:56:29.550 --> 00:56:30.660 align:middle line:90%
Because you love this.

00:56:30.660 --> 00:56:31.600 align:middle line:90%
You're so passionate.

00:56:31.600 --> 00:56:34.860 align:middle line:84%
You work so-- commit in such
a committed way with people.

00:56:34.860 --> 00:56:36.640 align:middle line:84%
Or are the other
people practicing this

00:56:36.640 --> 00:56:38.580 align:middle line:84%
also getting the
results with people?

00:56:38.580 --> 00:56:39.780 align:middle line:90%
>>MCKENNA: Oh my gosh, yes.

00:56:39.780 --> 00:56:40.580 align:middle line:90%
So--

00:56:40.580 --> 00:56:41.140 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: OK.

00:56:41.140 --> 00:56:41.940 align:middle line:90%
>>MCKENNA: Yeah.

00:56:41.940 --> 00:56:44.860 align:middle line:84%
So we have certified
practitioners across the United

00:56:44.860 --> 00:56:45.990 align:middle line:90%
States now.

00:56:45.990 --> 00:56:47.280 align:middle line:90%
We have so many.

00:56:47.280 --> 00:56:49.590 align:middle line:84%
Not only are they
getting the results.

00:56:49.590 --> 00:56:53.340 align:middle line:84%
But because we're doing this
now in classes, kind of like you

00:56:53.340 --> 00:56:54.180 align:middle line:90%
have a yoga class.

00:56:54.180 --> 00:56:54.550 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:56:54.550 --> 00:56:55.460 align:middle line:84%
>>MCKENNA: You're doing
it, Cognomovement--

00:56:55.460 --> 00:56:55.740 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: You should
do it with little kids.

00:56:55.740 --> 00:56:56.690 align:middle line:84%
>>MCKENNA: --for
the whole class.

00:56:56.690 --> 00:56:57.600 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:56:57.600 --> 00:57:00.810 align:middle line:84%
>>MCKENNA: Oh, gosh, I've got to
tell you about the little kids.

00:57:00.810 --> 00:57:03.150 align:middle line:90%
So the answer is yes.

00:57:03.150 --> 00:57:04.660 align:middle line:90%
Even teachers.

00:57:04.660 --> 00:57:08.400 align:middle line:84%
We certify, there's a
teacher, this one in Oregon.

00:57:08.400 --> 00:57:12.270 align:middle line:84%
What happened is
the year before,

00:57:12.270 --> 00:57:14.910 align:middle line:90%
he had 100 principal referrals.

00:57:14.910 --> 00:57:17.597 align:middle line:84%
And then after he started
using Cognomovement

00:57:17.597 --> 00:57:19.680 align:middle line:84%
in the classroom two times
a day for two minutes--

00:57:19.680 --> 00:57:20.960 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:57:20.960 --> 00:57:21.240 align:middle line:90%
>>MCKENNA: Two.

00:57:21.240 --> 00:57:22.350 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Yeah,
that makes sense.

00:57:22.350 --> 00:57:24.390 align:middle line:84%
That's what I was saying, is
little kids, because they don't

00:57:24.390 --> 00:57:26.432 align:middle line:84%
have a lot of programming
yet, this would-- well,

00:57:26.432 --> 00:57:28.980 align:middle line:84%
from other times maybe,
but in this time.

00:57:28.980 --> 00:57:30.210 align:middle line:90%
I think that's amazing.

00:57:30.210 --> 00:57:32.750 align:middle line:84%
What an amazing tool for
kids in the classroom.

00:57:32.750 --> 00:57:33.660 align:middle line:90%
I love it.

00:57:33.660 --> 00:57:35.520 align:middle line:84%
>>MCKENNA: Well, just the
principal referrals alone.

00:57:35.520 --> 00:57:37.187 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Well, what
about even at home?

00:57:37.187 --> 00:57:40.680 align:middle line:84%
Or you can do this
with each other.

00:57:40.680 --> 00:57:43.770 align:middle line:84%
When you do it, you know exactly
what to do as a practitioner,

00:57:43.770 --> 00:57:45.870 align:middle line:84%
how to move the ball
around and track the eye

00:57:45.870 --> 00:57:46.870 align:middle line:90%
movement and everything.

00:57:46.870 --> 00:57:49.920 align:middle line:84%
But at home, if you can just
do this with the feeling

00:57:49.920 --> 00:57:52.620 align:middle line:84%
and tossing the ball back and
forth with another person,

00:57:52.620 --> 00:57:54.180 align:middle line:90%
you can still get effect, right?

00:57:54.180 --> 00:57:55.450 align:middle line:90%
>>MCKENNA: Oh, you betcha.

00:57:55.450 --> 00:57:57.750 align:middle line:10%
And that's what the
website's all about.

00:57:57.750 --> 00:58:02.820 align:middle line:10%
We have an entire library
that people can join and get

>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:58:05.450 --> 00:58:07.158 align:middle line:10%
>>MCKENNA: And they
can do it themselves.

00:58:07.158 --> 00:58:09.570 align:middle line:90%
These are actual classes.

00:58:09.570 --> 00:58:10.890 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:58:10.890 --> 00:58:11.970 align:middle line:90%
Well, you know what?

00:58:11.970 --> 00:58:14.490 align:middle line:84%
And you did it because
you're so excited to wake up

00:58:14.490 --> 00:58:16.020 align:middle line:90%
every day to serve humanity.

00:58:16.020 --> 00:58:18.750 align:middle line:84%
Since I met you years ago
you've been like this.

00:58:18.750 --> 00:58:21.180 align:middle line:84%
And this came out of that
enthusiasm and excitement,

00:58:21.180 --> 00:58:23.700 align:middle line:84%
your observation, all
your skill from the past.

00:58:23.700 --> 00:58:25.140 align:middle line:90%
And you created Cognomovement.

00:58:25.140 --> 00:58:26.620 align:middle line:90%
And congratulations.

00:58:26.620 --> 00:58:28.800 align:middle line:90%
It's gone so far already.

>>MCKENNA: Oh, well,
and you know what?

00:58:30.510 --> 00:58:33.750 align:middle line:84%
We have so many people
that have contributed.

00:58:33.750 --> 00:58:35.440 align:middle line:90%
I can't even tell you.

00:58:35.440 --> 00:58:38.050 align:middle line:90%
And it's become a movement.

00:58:38.050 --> 00:58:40.155 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: It is,
a Cognomovement.

00:58:40.155 --> 00:58:42.480 align:middle line:90%
>>MCKENNA: [LAUGHS].

00:58:42.480 --> 00:58:44.670 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: OK, well, Bill,
thank you again so much.

And meanwhile, we'll
tell people how

00:58:49.990 --> 00:58:51.240 align:middle line:90%

00:58:51.240 --> 00:58:51.720 align:middle line:90%
