>> REGINA MEREDITH: One of the
systems I find really useful is

00:00:18.930 --> 00:00:21.720 align:middle line:10%
human design when it comes to
understanding how we function

00:00:21.720 --> 00:00:22.680 align:middle line:10%
in particular.

00:00:22.680 --> 00:00:25.020 align:middle line:84%
My friends and I refer
to it regularly when

00:00:25.020 --> 00:00:27.820 align:middle line:84%
trying to understand ourselves
and understand each other.

00:00:27.820 --> 00:00:30.210 align:middle line:84%
And today, Emma Dunwoody
is with us and she's

00:00:30.210 --> 00:00:31.860 align:middle line:84%
going to share how
the system works

00:00:31.860 --> 00:00:34.560 align:middle line:84%
and why it makes for
higher tolerances

00:00:34.560 --> 00:00:37.270 align:middle line:84%
not just of ourselves,
but for others as well.

00:00:37.270 --> 00:00:38.070 align:middle line:90%
And welcome.

00:00:38.070 --> 00:00:39.330 align:middle line:84%
It's the first
time I've met you.

00:00:39.330 --> 00:00:40.020 align:middle line:84%
>> EMMA DUNWOODY:
Yeah, thank you.

00:00:40.020 --> 00:00:40.950 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: From down under.

00:00:40.950 --> 00:00:43.000 align:middle line:84%
>>DUNWOODY: Exactly, all
the way from Australia.

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:43.875 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: I love it.

00:00:43.875 --> 00:00:45.690 align:middle line:84%
So let's just get
right into it, Emma.

00:00:45.690 --> 00:00:48.390 align:middle line:84%
How did you first
discover human design

00:00:48.390 --> 00:00:50.220 align:middle line:84%
and how did that
come into your life?

00:00:50.220 --> 00:00:54.160 align:middle line:84%
Because I think it's a really
profound, direct system.

00:00:54.160 --> 00:00:54.960 align:middle line:90%
>>DUNWOODY: Yeah.

00:00:54.960 --> 00:00:58.140 align:middle line:10%
Well, the big thing for
me was that I had spent--

00:00:58.140 --> 00:01:01.050 align:middle line:10%
I'd been diagnosed
very young, like at 28,

00:01:01.050 --> 00:01:03.390 align:middle line:10%
with depression and
panic disorder, which

00:01:03.390 --> 00:01:06.930 align:middle line:10%
was this catalyst for me
really starting to understand

00:01:06.930 --> 00:01:11.190 align:middle line:10%
the brain, behavior, even
quantum physics, psychology,

00:01:11.190 --> 00:01:12.180 align:middle line:10%
all of these things.

00:01:12.180 --> 00:01:14.940 align:middle line:84%
And that took me on this journey
of healing my mental health

00:01:14.940 --> 00:01:17.110 align:middle line:90%
and completely changing my life.

00:01:17.110 --> 00:01:19.460 align:middle line:10%
And then I would say,
about six years ago,

00:01:19.460 --> 00:01:22.720 align:middle line:10%
I had this moment where, wow,
I've changed my entire life.

00:01:22.720 --> 00:01:25.000 align:middle line:10%
Shouldn't I feel
better on the inside?

00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:27.368 align:middle line:84%
And at this moment in
time, I'm like, oh my god,

00:01:27.368 --> 00:01:28.660 align:middle line:90%
what am I going to do about it?

00:01:28.660 --> 00:01:29.780 align:middle line:90%
I'm meant to feel better.

00:01:29.780 --> 00:01:31.780 align:middle line:84%
And I just put this thing
out into the universe.

00:01:31.780 --> 00:01:33.190 align:middle line:84%
I was like,
universe, please, you

00:01:33.190 --> 00:01:34.750 align:middle line:90%
need to show me what's missing.

00:01:34.750 --> 00:01:36.940 align:middle line:84%
And, well, human
design came to me

00:01:36.940 --> 00:01:38.750 align:middle line:90%
over and over and over again.

00:01:38.750 --> 00:01:41.830 align:middle line:84%
So I committed to doing the
experiment, which is what

00:01:41.830 --> 00:01:43.330 align:middle line:90%
we talk about in human design.

00:01:43.330 --> 00:01:46.240 align:middle line:84%
And, well, I went from feeling
like there was something

00:01:46.240 --> 00:01:49.840 align:middle line:84%
missing in here to
living my dream life,

00:01:49.840 --> 00:01:53.860 align:middle line:84%
to doing my purpose,
to being fulfilled.

00:01:53.860 --> 00:01:56.080 align:middle line:84%
And human design
brought it in a way

00:01:56.080 --> 00:01:59.170 align:middle line:90%
where it was my unique playbook.

00:01:59.170 --> 00:02:01.180 align:middle line:84%
And I'd been trying
to put myself

00:02:01.180 --> 00:02:03.580 align:middle line:84%
into the playbook of life
that we're all given at birth

00:02:03.580 --> 00:02:05.200 align:middle line:90%
by our families and society.

00:02:05.200 --> 00:02:08.139 align:middle line:84%
And all of a sudden,
I could live my way,

00:02:08.139 --> 00:02:10.509 align:middle line:84%
and it just completely
transformed everything.

00:02:10.509 --> 00:02:12.290 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: I find it
truly transformative.

00:02:12.290 --> 00:02:14.633 align:middle line:84%
So you said you had to leave
behind your dream life?

00:02:14.633 --> 00:02:16.300 align:middle line:84%
OK, so tell us what
your dream life was.

00:02:16.300 --> 00:02:17.770 align:middle line:84%
And you were already
aware of human design.

00:02:17.770 --> 00:02:20.080 align:middle line:84%
You've been using human
design for quite a long time.

00:02:20.080 --> 00:02:20.880 align:middle line:90%
>>DUNWOODY: Yeah.

00:02:20.880 --> 00:02:22.330 align:middle line:84%
Yeah, so I think
the big thing is

00:02:22.330 --> 00:02:24.850 align:middle line:84%
that I had created a
life that I thought

00:02:24.850 --> 00:02:26.050 align:middle line:90%
was going to make me happy.

00:02:26.050 --> 00:02:30.880 align:middle line:84%
And I started in advertising,
and I had lived in the city,

00:02:30.880 --> 00:02:32.980 align:middle line:84%
and had the house,
and had the husband,

00:02:32.980 --> 00:02:34.850 align:middle line:90%
and all of those things.

00:02:34.850 --> 00:02:37.400 align:middle line:90%
But I just was so unhappy.

00:02:37.400 --> 00:02:40.360 align:middle line:84%
So I did all the things and I
loved people like Tony Robbins,

00:02:40.360 --> 00:02:43.580 align:middle line:84%
and I followed a lot of those
performance based people.

00:02:43.580 --> 00:02:46.990 align:middle line:84%
And I had so much change,
but it was this heart space.

00:02:46.990 --> 00:02:49.480 align:middle line:84%
Human design was
that heart space.

00:02:49.480 --> 00:02:53.020 align:middle line:84%
And I'd realized that I'd been
trying to create this life

00:02:53.020 --> 00:02:54.380 align:middle line:90%
and fit between these lines.

00:02:54.380 --> 00:02:59.890 align:middle line:84%
So we actually, very early on
in my human design experiment,

00:02:59.890 --> 00:03:02.557 align:middle line:84%
we bought a caravan
and a car, and we

00:03:02.557 --> 00:03:03.640 align:middle line:90%
traveled around Australia.

00:03:03.640 --> 00:03:05.350 align:middle line:84%
I ran my entire
business from there.

00:03:05.350 --> 00:03:06.550 align:middle line:90%
We took the kids.

00:03:06.550 --> 00:03:07.930 align:middle line:84%
And it was this
moment that I was

00:03:07.930 --> 00:03:09.890 align:middle line:84%
like, wow, when I
follow my design,

00:03:09.890 --> 00:03:11.830 align:middle line:84%
I really can live
any sort of life

00:03:11.830 --> 00:03:14.890 align:middle line:84%
instead of constantly being
on my own case that I have

00:03:14.890 --> 00:03:16.840 align:middle line:84%
to do it this way, I
have to do it that way,

00:03:16.840 --> 00:03:19.090 align:middle line:84%
and just diminishing my own
self worth and, of course,

00:03:19.090 --> 00:03:22.445 align:middle line:84%
not having the impact that
my heart is hanging to have.

00:03:22.445 --> 00:03:24.820 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: And so you were
following societal structures,

00:03:24.820 --> 00:03:27.710 align:middle line:84%
the things that are passed down
to us, like you say, the list,

00:03:27.710 --> 00:03:28.510 align:middle line:90%
the dream.

00:03:28.510 --> 00:03:30.370 align:middle line:84%
So let me just ask
you quickly, so

00:03:30.370 --> 00:03:32.110 align:middle line:84%
when you decided with
your human design

00:03:32.110 --> 00:03:34.780 align:middle line:84%
that you were going to actually
start living your type,

00:03:34.780 --> 00:03:39.280 align:middle line:84%
which really makes life nothing
but a wonderful experiment,

00:03:39.280 --> 00:03:43.360 align:middle line:84%
with sovereignty, how did
that work with your husband?

00:03:43.360 --> 00:03:46.000 align:middle line:84%
>>DUNWOODY: Yeah, this is such
a great question and I feel like

00:03:46.000 --> 00:03:46.300 align:middle line:90%
so many--

00:03:46.300 --> 00:03:47.360 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: It's a big
deal for everybody.

00:03:47.360 --> 00:03:47.960 align:middle line:90%
>>DUNWOODY: It's a big deal.

00:03:47.960 --> 00:03:49.330 align:middle line:90%
It's a really big deal.

00:03:49.330 --> 00:03:52.180 align:middle line:84%
And often in our spiritual
journey, one of us

00:03:52.180 --> 00:03:54.430 align:middle line:84%
is on the journey and the
other one isn't, and that

00:03:54.430 --> 00:03:56.230 align:middle line:90%
was very similar for us.

00:03:56.230 --> 00:03:59.350 align:middle line:84%
But the big thing that
changed for me was I

00:03:59.350 --> 00:04:01.310 align:middle line:84%
was here saying, come
on, you can do more.

00:04:01.310 --> 00:04:02.110 align:middle line:90%
You can do better.

00:04:02.110 --> 00:04:03.220 align:middle line:90%
Trying to champion him.

00:04:03.220 --> 00:04:05.230 align:middle line:84%
And I was juggling
two kids and I

00:04:05.230 --> 00:04:08.680 align:middle line:84%
was juggling studying,
and almost just waiting

00:04:08.680 --> 00:04:09.730 align:middle line:90%
for my turn.

00:04:09.730 --> 00:04:12.820 align:middle line:84%
And then when I understood human
design and this, of course,

00:04:12.820 --> 00:04:14.440 align:middle line:84%
serendipitous thing
happened where

00:04:14.440 --> 00:04:16.120 align:middle line:84%
he was given an
opportunity to take

00:04:16.120 --> 00:04:17.620 align:middle line:84%
what we call a
retrenchment package,

00:04:17.620 --> 00:04:21.829 align:middle line:84%
so he can take a big pay
out and leave his job.

00:04:21.829 --> 00:04:24.710 align:middle line:84%
And for some reason, something
in me said, oh, I'll do it.

00:04:24.710 --> 00:04:26.020 align:middle line:90%
I'll replace your income.

00:04:26.020 --> 00:04:27.850 align:middle line:84%
And he was on a big
wage at the time.

00:04:27.850 --> 00:04:29.200 align:middle line:90%
I have no idea why I did it.

00:04:29.200 --> 00:04:31.660 align:middle line:84%
But me being a manifesting
generator, I was like, wow,

00:04:31.660 --> 00:04:32.590 align:middle line:90%
and I'm away.

00:04:32.590 --> 00:04:35.710 align:middle line:84%
And then all of a sudden, I
could see him for who he is,

00:04:35.710 --> 00:04:36.940 align:middle line:90%
because he's a projector.

00:04:36.940 --> 00:04:40.690 align:middle line:84%
So I could start to understand,
right, so the way I live

00:04:40.690 --> 00:04:41.530 align:middle line:90%
is so different.

00:04:41.530 --> 00:04:42.220 align:middle line:90%
I'm passionate.

00:04:42.220 --> 00:04:43.020 align:middle line:90%
I'm excited.

00:04:43.020 --> 00:04:46.748 align:middle line:84%
I love to do this work, and I
can keep going, and dig deeper.

00:04:46.748 --> 00:04:48.040 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: You have the energy.

00:04:48.040 --> 00:04:49.700 align:middle line:90%
>>DUNWOODY: 100%.

00:04:49.700 --> 00:04:51.400 align:middle line:84%
And he doesn't have
that energy and he

00:04:51.400 --> 00:04:55.270 align:middle line:84%
doesn't have that consistent
enthusiasm driving him.

00:04:55.270 --> 00:04:57.100 align:middle line:84%
And what was beautiful
was just to see how

00:04:57.100 --> 00:04:58.490 align:middle line:90%
he could just flip everything.

00:04:58.490 --> 00:04:59.740 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Isn't that amazing?

00:04:59.740 --> 00:05:01.540 align:middle line:84%
He was living a type
that wasn't his.

00:05:01.540 --> 00:05:03.310 align:middle line:84%
You were living a
type that wasn't you.

00:05:03.310 --> 00:05:04.110 align:middle line:90%
>>DUNWOODY: Yeah.

00:05:04.110 --> 00:05:06.760 align:middle line:84%
And then, all of a sudden,
the resistance, the resistance

00:05:06.760 --> 00:05:08.302 align:middle line:84%
that we were
experiencing, whether it

00:05:08.302 --> 00:05:10.600 align:middle line:84%
was in our individual
lives or relationship,

00:05:10.600 --> 00:05:14.405 align:middle line:84%
started to fall away, and
the flow just moved in.

00:05:14.405 --> 00:05:15.280 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: I love it.

00:05:15.280 --> 00:05:17.280 align:middle line:84%
>>DUNWOODY: He's created
a whole business almost

00:05:17.280 --> 00:05:19.680 align:middle line:84%
by accident just
being in alignment

00:05:19.680 --> 00:05:20.975 align:middle line:90%
with being a projector.

00:05:20.975 --> 00:05:21.850 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: I love it.

00:05:21.850 --> 00:05:23.808 align:middle line:84%
And we're going to get
into this in just a sec.

00:05:23.808 --> 00:05:25.590 align:middle line:84%
So first of all,
human design we can't

00:05:25.590 --> 00:05:27.180 align:middle line:84%
go there without
talking about Ra

00:05:27.180 --> 00:05:28.710 align:middle line:84%
and how this whole
thing happened.

00:05:28.710 --> 00:05:31.920 align:middle line:84%
So go ahead and explain
what happened to this man.

00:05:31.920 --> 00:05:34.260 align:middle line:84%
>>DUNWOODY: Yeah, so
this was a man who was

00:05:34.260 --> 00:05:36.120 align:middle line:90%
very disillusioned with life.

00:05:36.120 --> 00:05:38.520 align:middle line:90%
He'd worked in advertising.

00:05:38.520 --> 00:05:41.767 align:middle line:84%
He'd had, I think, by that
stage, a number of marriages,

00:05:41.767 --> 00:05:43.350 align:middle line:84%
and he was looking
for something more.

00:05:43.350 --> 00:05:46.020 align:middle line:84%
And he was spending a
lot of time in Ibiza.

00:05:46.020 --> 00:05:50.100 align:middle line:84%
And he, one day,
started channeling

00:05:50.100 --> 00:05:51.540 align:middle line:90%
all of this information.

00:05:51.540 --> 00:05:53.680 align:middle line:84%
And he had this huge
resistance to it,

00:05:53.680 --> 00:05:55.290 align:middle line:84%
but, of course,
he did it anyway.

00:05:55.290 --> 00:05:57.780 align:middle line:84%
And over this period
of time of eight days,

00:05:57.780 --> 00:06:00.540 align:middle line:84%
I believe, he took
all the information,

00:06:00.540 --> 00:06:03.420 align:middle line:84%
he wrote it all down, and then
he brought it to the world.

00:06:03.420 --> 00:06:05.790 align:middle line:84%
Now, what has been very
beautiful about that

00:06:05.790 --> 00:06:08.010 align:middle line:84%
is that we are at
this time where

00:06:08.010 --> 00:06:11.310 align:middle line:84%
it doesn't have the
lineage, let's say,

00:06:11.310 --> 00:06:14.880 align:middle line:84%
of, let's say, astrology, but
we have this beautiful ability

00:06:14.880 --> 00:06:18.160 align:middle line:84%
to bring all this wisdom that
he channeled in from this guide

00:06:18.160 --> 00:06:19.930 align:middle line:90%
and he called it the Black Book.

00:06:19.930 --> 00:06:21.908 align:middle line:84%
And we are now in
this big experiment

00:06:21.908 --> 00:06:23.950 align:middle line:84%
because, ultimately, that's
what human design is.

00:06:23.950 --> 00:06:24.850 align:middle line:90%
It's an experiment.

00:06:24.850 --> 00:06:26.830 align:middle line:90%
It gives us this framework.

00:06:26.830 --> 00:06:29.140 align:middle line:84%
And something like the gene
keys puts all the beauty

00:06:29.140 --> 00:06:30.740 align:middle line:90%
around that framework.

00:06:30.740 --> 00:06:33.850 align:middle line:84%
And so Ra basically
brought it to the world,

00:06:33.850 --> 00:06:36.460 align:middle line:84%
he created this model,
he started to teach it

00:06:36.460 --> 00:06:37.870 align:middle line:90%
and took it out into the world.

00:06:37.870 --> 00:06:40.360 align:middle line:84%
And then I just feel like,
recently, probably the last two

00:06:40.360 --> 00:06:43.730 align:middle line:84%
years, it's like all of a
sudden where everyone wants to--

00:06:43.730 --> 00:06:44.530 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Exactly.

00:06:44.530 --> 00:06:48.070 align:middle line:84%
I've had friends at 22
or 23 years and people

00:06:48.070 --> 00:06:49.630 align:middle line:90%
who knew Ra actually.

00:06:49.630 --> 00:06:51.910 align:middle line:84%
And Richard was one
of the people who was

00:06:51.910 --> 00:06:53.470 align:middle line:90%
one of the top students of Ra.

00:06:53.470 --> 00:06:57.760 align:middle line:84%
And then Richard had his
own illuminating days

00:06:57.760 --> 00:07:01.180 align:middle line:84%
where it was then
the layers started

00:07:01.180 --> 00:07:03.430 align:middle line:84%
coming in, the kind
of a refinement,

00:07:03.430 --> 00:07:06.760 align:middle line:84%
almost like the spiritual
textures of human design

00:07:06.760 --> 00:07:08.290 align:middle line:90%
which became the gene keys.

00:07:08.290 --> 00:07:10.060 align:middle line:84%
And so it's really
quite beautiful

00:07:10.060 --> 00:07:11.260 align:middle line:90%
and works well together.

00:07:11.260 --> 00:07:12.060 align:middle line:90%
>>DUNWOODY: Yeah.

00:07:12.060 --> 00:07:14.740 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: One of the things
about the original human

00:07:14.740 --> 00:07:20.260 align:middle line:84%
design, I think, that so many
people enjoy is it's so clear.

00:07:20.260 --> 00:07:22.780 align:middle line:90%
It's about how you function.

00:07:22.780 --> 00:07:25.300 align:middle line:84%
Like you were saying,
this is all an experiment.

00:07:25.300 --> 00:07:27.160 align:middle line:84%
Well, it's easy to have
an experiment if you

00:07:27.160 --> 00:07:28.750 align:middle line:90%
have a home base to go to.

00:07:28.750 --> 00:07:31.510 align:middle line:84%
Untethered, experimenting
with your life is

00:07:31.510 --> 00:07:32.950 align:middle line:90%
a little more difficult. Right?

00:07:32.950 --> 00:07:34.040 align:middle line:90%
>>DUNWOODY: 100%.

00:07:34.040 --> 00:07:36.290 align:middle line:84%
And I think one of the biggest
things-- my background,

00:07:36.290 --> 00:07:38.620 align:middle line:84%
I'm a behavioral
coach, so I'm always

00:07:38.620 --> 00:07:42.527 align:middle line:84%
thinking about how the brain
works or behavioral patterns.

00:07:42.527 --> 00:07:44.110 align:middle line:84%
And one of the things
I'm always doing

00:07:44.110 --> 00:07:46.090 align:middle line:84%
is helping people make
the unconscious conscious,

00:07:46.090 --> 00:07:47.757 align:middle line:84%
because, of course,
most of our behavior

00:07:47.757 --> 00:07:49.150 align:middle line:90%
comes from the unconscious mind.

00:07:49.150 --> 00:07:50.890 align:middle line:84%
And one of the things
that-- the reason

00:07:50.890 --> 00:07:53.380 align:middle line:84%
I've created
transformational human design

00:07:53.380 --> 00:07:57.460 align:middle line:84%
is because, so often, there's
so many people out there looking

00:07:57.460 --> 00:08:00.640 align:middle line:84%
for the answer and we're
trying to fit ourselves

00:08:00.640 --> 00:08:02.230 align:middle line:90%
into everybody else's model.

00:08:02.230 --> 00:08:05.770 align:middle line:84%
When we overlay human design,
we can look at the specificity.

00:08:05.770 --> 00:08:08.320 align:middle line:84%
We can really look at
our specific shadows

00:08:08.320 --> 00:08:11.020 align:middle line:84%
and say, where is that
turning up in my life?

00:08:11.020 --> 00:08:14.020 align:middle line:84%
And then we can add
things like the gene keys

00:08:14.020 --> 00:08:16.820 align:middle line:84%
to really see the potential
that lies within us.

00:08:16.820 --> 00:08:21.100 align:middle line:84%
And that, for me, I went
from having a business that

00:08:21.100 --> 00:08:24.560 align:middle line:84%
was successful in corporate,
coaching C-level executives

00:08:24.560 --> 00:08:25.360 align:middle line:90%
and teams.

00:08:25.360 --> 00:08:27.193 align:middle line:84%
And they were already
getting great results,

00:08:27.193 --> 00:08:29.710 align:middle line:84%
but the moment I integrated
human design into it,

00:08:29.710 --> 00:08:31.880 align:middle line:84%
it just expanded
because, of course,

00:08:31.880 --> 00:08:33.280 align:middle line:90%
they let go of all the rules.

00:08:33.280 --> 00:08:36.340 align:middle line:84%
They let go of the way
they were supposed to lead,

00:08:36.340 --> 00:08:38.559 align:middle line:84%
or they let go of the
way they were supposed

00:08:38.559 --> 00:08:40.690 align:middle line:84%
to interact with
their team members,

00:08:40.690 --> 00:08:43.630 align:middle line:84%
or even understanding-- when you
understand that, let's say, you

00:08:43.630 --> 00:08:46.360 align:middle line:84%
have a manifestor in your
team, these people are

00:08:46.360 --> 00:08:49.600 align:middle line:84%
going to be initiating, and so
you want to give them freedom.

00:08:49.600 --> 00:08:52.660 align:middle line:84%
If you have a projector in your
team, then you're going to ask.

00:08:52.660 --> 00:08:55.250 align:middle line:84%
If they are giving you guidance,
you're going to listen.

00:08:55.250 --> 00:08:58.420 align:middle line:84%
And it really made such
an instant difference

00:08:58.420 --> 00:08:59.693 align:middle line:90%
because of the specificity.

00:08:59.693 --> 00:09:00.610 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Absolutely.

00:09:00.610 --> 00:09:03.160 align:middle line:84%
So the whole thing is,
once you can sort of

00:09:03.160 --> 00:09:05.680 align:middle line:84%
see this template
about yourself,

00:09:05.680 --> 00:09:08.420 align:middle line:84%
is to now start experimenting
with honoring it,

00:09:08.420 --> 00:09:11.860 align:middle line:84%
which might mean
breaking lifelong habits

00:09:11.860 --> 00:09:14.580 align:middle line:84%
and having to show up in the
world in a new way to others

00:09:14.580 --> 00:09:15.380 align:middle line:90%
as well.

00:09:15.380 --> 00:09:17.620 align:middle line:84%
So we're going to take
a look at the chart here

00:09:17.620 --> 00:09:20.020 align:middle line:84%
and you can just
explain to us, starting

00:09:20.020 --> 00:09:22.840 align:middle line:84%
with the very top
center and going down,

00:09:22.840 --> 00:09:24.250 align:middle line:90%
what these centers are.

00:09:24.250 --> 00:09:26.750 align:middle line:84%
Because it looks a lot like the
tree of life in certain ways

00:09:26.750 --> 00:09:27.550 align:middle line:90%
too.

00:09:27.550 --> 00:09:28.720 align:middle line:90%
>>DUNWOODY: Yeah, and it is.

00:09:28.720 --> 00:09:32.080 align:middle line:84%
It's connected to
these ancient wisdoms.

00:09:32.080 --> 00:09:35.230 align:middle line:84%
So we start at the head
with the head center.

00:09:35.230 --> 00:09:38.110 align:middle line:84%
And this is all about-- it's
what we call a pressure center.

00:09:38.110 --> 00:09:40.570 align:middle line:84%
And there's all this information
coming in from source.

00:09:40.570 --> 00:09:42.970 align:middle line:84%
So it's about questioning,
questions, questions,

00:09:42.970 --> 00:09:43.870 align:middle line:90%
questions.

00:09:43.870 --> 00:09:45.310 align:middle line:84%
And then we move
down to thinking

00:09:45.310 --> 00:09:48.400 align:middle line:84%
and it's processing, which
is the next downward facing

00:09:48.400 --> 00:09:50.380 align:middle line:90%
triangle, which is the ajna.

00:09:50.380 --> 00:09:53.200 align:middle line:84%
And again, if these two
areas have a colored in,

00:09:53.200 --> 00:09:54.460 align:middle line:90%
then we call it defined.

00:09:54.460 --> 00:09:56.440 align:middle line:84%
If it's undefined,
they're white.

00:09:56.440 --> 00:09:59.380 align:middle line:84%
And that's going to change
how that energy flows.

00:09:59.380 --> 00:10:01.420 align:middle line:84%
Then we move down to
the throat center.

00:10:01.420 --> 00:10:05.080 align:middle line:84%
So in a human design chart,
all the energy in your chart,

00:10:05.080 --> 00:10:08.080 align:middle line:84%
its purpose is to get to the
throat for manifestation.

00:10:08.080 --> 00:10:11.470 align:middle line:84%
Now, not all of us have a
colored in or defined throat.

00:10:11.470 --> 00:10:13.632 align:middle line:84%
So what happens is
that, when we're in flow

00:10:13.632 --> 00:10:15.340 align:middle line:84%
and we follow our
strategy and authority,

00:10:15.340 --> 00:10:17.195 align:middle line:84%
which are the two most
important things in our chart--

00:10:17.195 --> 00:10:19.580 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: Yeah, we'll get
into all of those details.

00:10:19.580 --> 00:10:20.870 align:middle line:84%
>>DUNWOODY: --then
what's going to happen

00:10:20.870 --> 00:10:23.453 align:middle line:84%
is the universe is almost going
to move us like a puzzle piece

00:10:23.453 --> 00:10:25.470 align:middle line:84%
to the right people,
to the right places

00:10:25.470 --> 00:10:28.430 align:middle line:84%
so that it helps our
energy flow to the throat.

00:10:28.430 --> 00:10:29.990 align:middle line:84%
Then we move down
to the G center,

00:10:29.990 --> 00:10:31.290 align:middle line:90%
which is a diamond shape.

00:10:31.290 --> 00:10:32.840 align:middle line:84%
And if it's colored
in, it's yellow.

00:10:32.840 --> 00:10:34.890 align:middle line:90%
And this is the higher self.

00:10:34.890 --> 00:10:37.850 align:middle line:84%
This is like unconditional
love, higher consciousness,

00:10:37.850 --> 00:10:40.430 align:middle line:84%
and it's all about our
internal direction.

00:10:40.430 --> 00:10:43.280 align:middle line:84%
Then, all of a sudden, they
kind of split out a little bit.

00:10:43.280 --> 00:10:46.130 align:middle line:84%
Directly down, we
have the sacral.

00:10:46.130 --> 00:10:48.410 align:middle line:84%
Now, the sacral is a big
player in human design

00:10:48.410 --> 00:10:50.420 align:middle line:84%
because 70% of the
global population

00:10:50.420 --> 00:10:51.720 align:middle line:90%
will have that colored in.

00:10:51.720 --> 00:10:55.070 align:middle line:84%
And this is all about
life force, the work

00:10:55.070 --> 00:10:56.340 align:middle line:90%
that we want to do, expanding.

00:10:56.340 --> 00:10:57.140 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Energy.

00:10:57.140 --> 00:10:58.070 align:middle line:90%
>>DUNWOODY: Yeah, exactly.

00:10:58.070 --> 00:10:58.880 align:middle line:90%
Power.

00:10:58.880 --> 00:11:02.580 align:middle line:84%
Then when we move off to
the little triangle up

00:11:02.580 --> 00:11:03.380 align:middle line:90%
and to the right.

00:11:03.380 --> 00:11:04.790 align:middle line:84%
That's what we call
the will center.

00:11:04.790 --> 00:11:06.890 align:middle line:84%
It's also called the ego
center and the heart center.

00:11:06.890 --> 00:11:07.765 align:middle line:90%
It's got a few names.

00:11:07.765 --> 00:11:09.200 align:middle line:90%
I'm not sure why, but it does.

00:11:09.200 --> 00:11:13.730 align:middle line:84%
And this is all about yes,
will energy, this will power,

00:11:13.730 --> 00:11:14.990 align:middle line:90%
determination.

00:11:14.990 --> 00:11:18.160 align:middle line:84%
It's very connected to the
three dimensional world.

00:11:18.160 --> 00:11:20.340 align:middle line:84%
So these people, if
it's colored in for you,

00:11:20.340 --> 00:11:23.220 align:middle line:84%
you probably want to create--
your very conscious of your 3D

00:11:23.220 --> 00:11:25.235 align:middle line:84%
reality, like the
car you drive maybe,

00:11:25.235 --> 00:11:26.610 align:middle line:84%
or the life that
you're building.

00:11:26.610 --> 00:11:29.520 align:middle line:84%
You're very focused on
that being a nice thing.

00:11:29.520 --> 00:11:32.600 align:middle line:84%
Now, we move down to the big
triangle on the right hand

00:11:32.600 --> 00:11:33.400 align:middle line:90%
side.

00:11:33.400 --> 00:11:36.310 align:middle line:84%
That is your emotional
solar plexus.

00:11:36.310 --> 00:11:37.650 align:middle line:90%
This is a big player.

00:11:37.650 --> 00:11:40.080 align:middle line:84%
And there's a big
shift that's going on

00:11:40.080 --> 00:11:41.760 align:middle line:90%
with this particular center.

00:11:41.760 --> 00:11:45.530 align:middle line:84%
Now, half the global population
have that colored in and half

00:11:45.530 --> 00:11:46.330 align:middle line:90%
don't.

00:11:46.330 --> 00:11:49.590 align:middle line:84%
And I've often heard it
explained as it's like two

00:11:49.590 --> 00:11:52.758 align:middle line:84%
completely different
races of human,

00:11:52.758 --> 00:11:55.050 align:middle line:84%
because some of us are
emotional and some of us aren't.

00:11:55.050 --> 00:11:58.590 align:middle line:84%
And I'm an emotional being
and I ride this emotional wave

00:11:58.590 --> 00:11:59.550 align:middle line:90%
all the time.

00:11:59.550 --> 00:12:01.467 align:middle line:84%
And one of the things
that human design really

00:12:01.467 --> 00:12:04.230 align:middle line:84%
helped me understand was, as a
behavioral coach and learning

00:12:04.230 --> 00:12:07.020 align:middle line:84%
NLP and mindset work, I
would do all the work,

00:12:07.020 --> 00:12:09.330 align:middle line:84%
but I wouldn't necessarily
have the change as fast as I

00:12:09.330 --> 00:12:10.830 align:middle line:90%
would see other people have it.

00:12:10.830 --> 00:12:12.810 align:middle line:84%
And I would think, well,
it's what I'm thinking

00:12:12.810 --> 00:12:14.430 align:middle line:90%
that's creating this emotion.

00:12:14.430 --> 00:12:17.702 align:middle line:84%
Now, if you're defined, if
that's colored in your chart,

00:12:17.702 --> 00:12:19.410 align:middle line:84%
then that's not entirely
true because you

00:12:19.410 --> 00:12:23.320 align:middle line:84%
have this mechanical wave that's
always going on inside of you.

00:12:23.320 --> 00:12:27.300 align:middle line:84%
So when you understand that
and you let it be there, then,

00:12:27.300 --> 00:12:29.218 align:middle line:84%
all of a sudden, those
unresourceful stories

00:12:29.218 --> 00:12:30.760 align:middle line:84%
that you tell yourself
in your head--

00:12:30.760 --> 00:12:32.730 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: So you just don't
put stories to the emotions

00:12:32.730 --> 00:12:34.860 align:middle line:84%
and understand they're just
going to keep waving through

00:12:34.860 --> 00:12:35.190 align:middle line:90%
you?

00:12:35.190 --> 00:12:35.490 align:middle line:90%
>>DUNWOODY: Yeah.

00:12:35.490 --> 00:12:37.823 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: OK, because the
stories are what take us down

00:12:37.823 --> 00:12:39.090 align:middle line:90%
and waste our energy and time.

00:12:39.090 --> 00:12:39.810 align:middle line:84%
>>DUNWOODY: That's
exactly right.

00:12:39.810 --> 00:12:41.490 align:middle line:90%
And the meanings we give it.

00:12:41.490 --> 00:12:42.960 align:middle line:84%
If we give our
emotions-- so now,

00:12:42.960 --> 00:12:44.760 align:middle line:84%
I've given my emotional
low the meaning

00:12:44.760 --> 00:12:48.030 align:middle line:84%
that it's super
important to actually

00:12:48.030 --> 00:12:49.080 align:middle line:90%
make it really positive.

00:12:49.080 --> 00:12:50.670 align:middle line:90%
OK, I'm in my emotional low.

00:12:50.670 --> 00:12:53.280 align:middle line:84%
Therefore, I need
to nurture myself.

00:12:53.280 --> 00:12:55.740 align:middle line:84%
As opposed to, oh, my goodness,
I need to work harder,

00:12:55.740 --> 00:12:57.220 align:middle line:84%
I need to do more, I
need to push harder.

00:12:57.220 --> 00:12:59.010 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: And you need to
figure out what this is,

00:12:59.010 --> 00:13:00.060 align:middle line:90%
where is it coming from.

00:13:00.060 --> 00:13:00.360 align:middle line:90%
>>DUNWOODY: Exactly.

00:13:00.360 --> 00:13:02.527 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: So you stop that,
because that can become

00:13:02.527 --> 00:13:03.720 align:middle line:90%
a really neurotic game.

00:13:03.720 --> 00:13:05.970 align:middle line:84%
>>DUNWOODY: Yeah, especially
if you've got definition

00:13:05.970 --> 00:13:07.050 align:middle line:90%
and it never goes away.

00:13:07.050 --> 00:13:08.010 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: What about people--

00:13:08.010 --> 00:13:10.343 align:middle line:84%
the other half of the population
where it's not defined?

00:13:10.343 --> 00:13:12.520 align:middle line:84%
>>DUNWOODY: Yeah, now,
this is where it can be--

00:13:12.520 --> 00:13:14.070 align:middle line:90%
it's a gift and a challenge.

00:13:14.070 --> 00:13:15.780 align:middle line:84%
Because, when it's
not defined, anywhere

00:13:15.780 --> 00:13:19.530 align:middle line:84%
that we have a white center,
it's amplifying any energy

00:13:19.530 --> 00:13:20.580 align:middle line:90%
that someone else has.

00:13:20.580 --> 00:13:22.548 align:middle line:84%
So I have a defined
solar plexus.

00:13:22.548 --> 00:13:24.090 align:middle line:84%
So someone who
doesn't, they're going

00:13:24.090 --> 00:13:26.830 align:middle line:84%
to amplify and reflect
back my emotional energy.

00:13:26.830 --> 00:13:31.290 align:middle line:84%
So imagine children with an
emotional defined mother,

00:13:31.290 --> 00:13:33.217 align:middle line:84%
or brother, or
sister, or father.

00:13:33.217 --> 00:13:34.800 align:middle line:84%
And they're not
emotional, but they're

00:13:34.800 --> 00:13:36.388 align:middle line:84%
feeling these
really big emotions

00:13:36.388 --> 00:13:37.680 align:middle line:90%
that are bigger than their own.

00:13:37.680 --> 00:13:41.543 align:middle line:84%
And of course, if we think about
the behavioral or the mindset

00:13:41.543 --> 00:13:43.710 align:middle line:84%
implications of that, then
they create this identity

00:13:43.710 --> 00:13:45.870 align:middle line:84%
that they're emotional
and they try and fix it

00:13:45.870 --> 00:13:46.950 align:middle line:90%
in their adult life.

00:13:46.950 --> 00:13:48.670 align:middle line:84%
And of course, they
can't, because--

00:13:48.670 --> 00:13:49.890 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: It wasn't
theirs to begin with.

00:13:49.890 --> 00:13:50.820 align:middle line:90%
>>DUNWOODY: Exactly.

00:13:50.820 --> 00:13:54.390 align:middle line:84%
So the solar plexus is a really
big player and it's a really--

00:13:54.390 --> 00:13:56.280 align:middle line:84%
when you understand
your definition there,

00:13:56.280 --> 00:13:58.300 align:middle line:84%
it can really help in
your healing journey.

00:13:58.300 --> 00:13:59.100 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: OK.

00:13:59.100 --> 00:14:00.755 align:middle line:84%
And what about off
to the left there?

00:14:00.755 --> 00:14:02.880 align:middle line:84%
>>DUNWOODY: So off to the
left, we have the spleen,

00:14:02.880 --> 00:14:04.200 align:middle line:90%
and that is the intuition.

00:14:04.200 --> 00:14:07.350 align:middle line:84%
It's kind of like the
ancient part of the chart.

00:14:07.350 --> 00:14:09.600 align:middle line:84%
It's about health,
well-being, intuition.

00:14:09.600 --> 00:14:11.790 align:middle line:84%
If it's colored in,
you're probably a person

00:14:11.790 --> 00:14:14.430 align:middle line:90%
that you have a lot more--

00:14:14.430 --> 00:14:17.175 align:middle line:90%
easy well-being, if you like.

00:14:17.175 --> 00:14:18.300 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: General stamina.

00:14:18.300 --> 00:14:18.900 align:middle line:90%
>>DUNWOODY: Exactly.

00:14:18.900 --> 00:14:20.010 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Inherent stamina.

00:14:20.010 --> 00:14:20.810 align:middle line:90%
>>DUNWOODY: Yes.

00:14:20.810 --> 00:14:23.010 align:middle line:84%
And you'll have a
really consistent way

00:14:23.010 --> 00:14:25.050 align:middle line:90%
of your intuition showing up.

00:14:25.050 --> 00:14:26.760 align:middle line:84%
Whereas when you're
undefined, it's

00:14:26.760 --> 00:14:28.380 align:middle line:84%
going to depend on
who you're around.

00:14:28.380 --> 00:14:31.440 align:middle line:84%
So I'm undefined and I've got
a lot of intuitive friends.

00:14:31.440 --> 00:14:33.280 align:middle line:84%
So when I'm with
the ones that are,

00:14:33.280 --> 00:14:35.650 align:middle line:84%
let's say, clairvoyant,
then, all of a sudden,

00:14:35.650 --> 00:14:36.780 align:middle line:90%
I see a lot more images.

00:14:36.780 --> 00:14:40.410 align:middle line:84%
But when I'm with friends that,
let's say, are clairsentient,

00:14:40.410 --> 00:14:42.480 align:middle line:84%
then I feel a lot more
of their clairsentience

00:14:42.480 --> 00:14:45.390 align:middle line:84%
because I'm amplifying and
reflecting back that energy.

00:14:45.390 --> 00:14:48.952 align:middle line:84%
And then, down the bottom,
we have the root center.

00:14:48.952 --> 00:14:50.910 align:middle line:84%
And the root center is
another pressure center.

00:14:50.910 --> 00:14:52.620 align:middle line:84%
It's the energy
coming up from Gaia,

00:14:52.620 --> 00:14:54.420 align:middle line:84%
pushing the energy
around the chart.

00:14:54.420 --> 00:14:58.140 align:middle line:84%
And this is all about
movement, progress,

00:14:58.140 --> 00:15:01.890 align:middle line:84%
and the fuel that drives either
emotional energy, well-being,

00:15:01.890 --> 00:15:04.530 align:middle line:90%
or that life force energy.

00:15:04.530 --> 00:15:07.710 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: And then people can
see also there are these lines,

00:15:07.710 --> 00:15:10.380 align:middle line:90%
some red, some black coming out.

00:15:10.380 --> 00:15:13.230 align:middle line:84%
And this is where,
later on, you also start

00:15:13.230 --> 00:15:16.850 align:middle line:84%
looking at how your chart
overlays with another person's

00:15:16.850 --> 00:15:19.550 align:middle line:84%
chart, where these
lines link up,

00:15:19.550 --> 00:15:22.110 align:middle line:84%
and where they're not
coming out at all.

00:15:22.110 --> 00:15:23.810 align:middle line:84%
And I guess it
shows you the things

00:15:23.810 --> 00:15:27.660 align:middle line:84%
you have to work-- that are open
that you both have to work on,

00:15:27.660 --> 00:15:31.910 align:middle line:84%
but also areas where you
can really help and finish

00:15:31.910 --> 00:15:33.890 align:middle line:90%
an energy with another person.

00:15:33.890 --> 00:15:34.760 align:middle line:90%
>>DUNWOODY: Exactly.

00:15:34.760 --> 00:15:36.500 align:middle line:84%
I was just saying
to someone recently

00:15:36.500 --> 00:15:39.200 align:middle line:84%
who was what we call a
split definition, which

00:15:39.200 --> 00:15:41.060 align:middle line:84%
means they've got these
areas of definition

00:15:41.060 --> 00:15:43.290 align:middle line:84%
where two centers
maybe are connected,

00:15:43.290 --> 00:15:44.940 align:middle line:84%
but they're not all
connected together.

00:15:44.940 --> 00:15:47.090 align:middle line:84%
And if we feel
stuck in our energy

00:15:47.090 --> 00:15:50.420 align:middle line:84%
and we have a split definition,
if we just go to the cafe

00:15:50.420 --> 00:15:52.228 align:middle line:84%
or go and lie on the
beach or something

00:15:52.228 --> 00:15:54.020 align:middle line:84%
where there's people
around us, then that's

00:15:54.020 --> 00:15:56.240 align:middle line:84%
going to, in most cases,
help our energy flow

00:15:56.240 --> 00:15:59.190 align:middle line:84%
because that's exactly how our
designs plug into each other.

00:15:59.190 --> 00:15:59.990 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Exactly.

00:15:59.990 --> 00:16:01.107 align:middle line:90%
And this is a collective.

00:16:01.107 --> 00:16:01.940 align:middle line:90%
>>DUNWOODY: Exactly.

00:16:01.940 --> 00:16:04.315 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: And so one thing
a friend of mine who's deeply

00:16:04.315 --> 00:16:06.260 align:middle line:84%
into human design
explained is that,

00:16:06.260 --> 00:16:08.150 align:middle line:84%
going back to the
emotions, because, again,

00:16:08.150 --> 00:16:10.940 align:middle line:84%
it's 50/50 on the planet,
let's go over to the other one,

00:16:10.940 --> 00:16:13.790 align:middle line:84%
to the spleen, the center
of well-being, that,

00:16:13.790 --> 00:16:17.910 align:middle line:84%
when you have a person that
is undefined in that area,

00:16:17.910 --> 00:16:19.830 align:middle line:84%
spending time with
someone who's defined,

00:16:19.830 --> 00:16:22.830 align:middle line:84%
that the person who's
undefined often will relax.

00:16:22.830 --> 00:16:27.870 align:middle line:84%
And they also gain more of a
feeling of well-being or safety

00:16:27.870 --> 00:16:29.680 align:middle line:90%
around that person.

00:16:29.680 --> 00:16:30.850 align:middle line:90%
Why would that be?

00:16:30.850 --> 00:16:32.433 align:middle line:84%
>>DUNWOODY: Well, I
love this question

00:16:32.433 --> 00:16:36.570 align:middle line:84%
because this is-- in many,
many worlds or groups

00:16:36.570 --> 00:16:38.100 align:middle line:84%
in human design,
people would have

00:16:38.100 --> 00:16:39.270 align:middle line:90%
asked the opposite question.

00:16:39.270 --> 00:16:42.030 align:middle line:84%
Why when I hang out with
people with a defined spleen,

00:16:42.030 --> 00:16:43.650 align:middle line:90%
am I unwell and fearful?

00:16:43.650 --> 00:16:45.330 align:middle line:84%
Because fear lives
in the spleen.

00:16:45.330 --> 00:16:46.680 align:middle line:90%
But you're absolutely right.

00:16:46.680 --> 00:16:48.460 align:middle line:84%
When the person
with the definition,

00:16:48.460 --> 00:16:50.002 align:middle line:84%
especially in the
spleen because it's

00:16:50.002 --> 00:16:53.010 align:middle line:84%
the house of fear, when they're
aligned and they're well,

00:16:53.010 --> 00:16:55.810 align:middle line:84%
they're actually amplifying
the well-being of the people

00:16:55.810 --> 00:16:56.610 align:middle line:90%
that they're with.

00:16:56.610 --> 00:16:57.410 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Yeah.

00:16:57.410 --> 00:16:58.900 align:middle line:90%
That's been my experience.

00:16:58.900 --> 00:16:59.700 align:middle line:90%
>>DUNWOODY: Yeah.

00:16:59.700 --> 00:17:00.658 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Interesting.

00:17:00.658 --> 00:17:03.480 align:middle line:84%
OK, so now, we're going to
talk about the four types,

00:17:03.480 --> 00:17:06.119 align:middle line:84%
the main types, and
how they function,

00:17:06.119 --> 00:17:08.760 align:middle line:84%
and what happens when
we don't understand

00:17:08.760 --> 00:17:09.990 align:middle line:90%
this about each other.

00:17:09.990 --> 00:17:14.220 align:middle line:84%
Because this leads to so much
turmoil and misunderstanding

00:17:14.220 --> 00:17:15.390 align:middle line:90%
between us.

00:17:15.390 --> 00:17:18.900 align:middle line:84%
In my opinion, in every
corporate situation,

00:17:18.900 --> 00:17:21.030 align:middle line:84%
even in the school
room, we should

00:17:21.030 --> 00:17:23.670 align:middle line:84%
have an idea of the basic
nature of the functioning

00:17:23.670 --> 00:17:24.473 align:middle line:90%
of each other.

00:17:24.473 --> 00:17:25.890 align:middle line:84%
>>DUNWOODY: I
couldn't agree more.

00:17:25.890 --> 00:17:27.850 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: OK, we start
out with generators.

00:17:27.850 --> 00:17:29.100 align:middle line:90%
>>DUNWOODY: Yeah, let's do it.

00:17:29.100 --> 00:17:33.360 align:middle line:84%
So generators, there's
two types, if you like,

00:17:33.360 --> 00:17:36.535 align:middle line:84%
because generators make up
70% of the global population,

00:17:36.535 --> 00:17:38.160 align:middle line:84%
but we have this
hybrid which is called

00:17:38.160 --> 00:17:41.250 align:middle line:84%
a manifesting generator,
which is part generator, part

00:17:41.250 --> 00:17:42.050 align:middle line:90%
manifestor.

00:17:42.050 --> 00:17:42.600 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: And that's you.

00:17:42.600 --> 00:17:44.760 align:middle line:84%
>>DUNWOODY: That's me,
the Energizer bunny,

00:17:44.760 --> 00:17:46.350 align:middle line:90%
which we're often referred to.

00:17:46.350 --> 00:17:50.010 align:middle line:84%
Now, generators, we're here
to be lit up and excited,

00:17:50.010 --> 00:17:52.680 align:middle line:84%
inspired into action by
our manifestor friends,

00:17:52.680 --> 00:17:53.670 align:middle line:90%
in many cases.

00:17:53.670 --> 00:17:56.340 align:middle line:84%
But ultimately, our
sacral is saying,

00:17:56.340 --> 00:17:57.540 align:middle line:90%
I've got energy for this.

00:17:57.540 --> 00:17:59.010 align:middle line:90%
I've got enthusiasm for this.

00:17:59.010 --> 00:17:59.830 align:middle line:90%
Let's build it.

00:17:59.830 --> 00:18:00.520 align:middle line:90%
Let's grow it.

00:18:00.520 --> 00:18:01.410 align:middle line:90%
Let's follow it.

00:18:01.410 --> 00:18:03.872 align:middle line:84%
So they're very
much here to build

00:18:03.872 --> 00:18:05.580 align:middle line:84%
something they're very
enthusiastic about

00:18:05.580 --> 00:18:07.090 align:middle line:90%
and they're passionate about.

00:18:07.090 --> 00:18:09.960 align:middle line:84%
They're also the people that
are here to respond to life.

00:18:09.960 --> 00:18:13.320 align:middle line:84%
Now, we're so taught to go
out and take massive action,

00:18:13.320 --> 00:18:15.552 align:middle line:84%
but generators are
not designed that way.

00:18:15.552 --> 00:18:17.010 align:middle line:84%
They're actually
designed to follow

00:18:17.010 --> 00:18:18.967 align:middle line:84%
what they enjoy,
what they're excited,

00:18:18.967 --> 00:18:20.050 align:middle line:90%
what they're lit up about.

00:18:20.050 --> 00:18:22.470 align:middle line:84%
And then it's like the
universe brings them

00:18:22.470 --> 00:18:24.240 align:middle line:90%
opportunity after opportunity.

00:18:24.240 --> 00:18:26.850 align:middle line:84%
And it doesn't have to
be like the dream job.

00:18:26.850 --> 00:18:28.470 align:middle line:84%
That's one way
people can respond.

00:18:28.470 --> 00:18:29.970 align:middle line:84%
But they're
responding when they--

00:18:29.970 --> 00:18:31.530 align:middle line:84%
let's say, they open
the refrigerator

00:18:31.530 --> 00:18:33.030 align:middle line:84%
and they're like,
wow, I really want

00:18:33.030 --> 00:18:34.830 align:middle line:90%
to eat that chocolate mousse.

00:18:34.830 --> 00:18:36.300 align:middle line:90%
That's a generator.

00:18:36.300 --> 00:18:39.510 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: So to be enthused
is really the fuel that keeps

00:18:39.510 --> 00:18:42.120 align:middle line:84%
generators moving forward
on track and healthy?

00:18:42.120 --> 00:18:43.380 align:middle line:90%
>>DUNWOODY: Exactly.

00:18:43.380 --> 00:18:45.240 align:middle line:84%
And the biggest challenge
is, because they

00:18:45.240 --> 00:18:48.750 align:middle line:84%
have this energy and this
ability, is, in many cases,

00:18:48.750 --> 00:18:50.400 align:middle line:90%
they don't have boundaries.

00:18:50.400 --> 00:18:51.900 align:middle line:84%
They think, well,
I have the energy,

00:18:51.900 --> 00:18:53.720 align:middle line:84%
or I can do it, or
just put it on me.

00:18:53.720 --> 00:18:54.520 align:middle line:90%
I'll take it.

00:18:54.520 --> 00:18:55.290 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: I'll
volunteer, right.

00:18:55.290 --> 00:18:56.462 align:middle line:90%
>>DUNWOODY: Yeah, exactly.

00:18:56.462 --> 00:18:58.170 align:middle line:84%
So that's probably
the biggest challenge.

00:18:58.170 --> 00:18:59.610 align:middle line:84%
And because they're
very magnetic.

00:18:59.610 --> 00:19:01.920 align:middle line:84%
A generator type is
a very magnetic type.

00:19:01.920 --> 00:19:03.420 align:middle line:90%
People are very drawn to them.

00:19:03.420 --> 00:19:05.910 align:middle line:84%
And because of the other
details of their chart,

00:19:05.910 --> 00:19:08.790 align:middle line:84%
they often find they're
very obligated to help.

00:19:08.790 --> 00:19:11.100 align:middle line:84%
So it's very important that
they follow that enthusiasm

00:19:11.100 --> 00:19:13.080 align:middle line:84%
because their sacral
is always telling them,

00:19:13.080 --> 00:19:16.080 align:middle line:84%
yep, you have energy
for this, or nope,

00:19:16.080 --> 00:19:17.410 align:middle line:90%
you don't have energy for this.

00:19:17.410 --> 00:19:20.220 align:middle line:84%
So if they can just trust
that simple yes, no,

00:19:20.220 --> 00:19:22.298 align:middle line:90%
it's a life changer for them.

00:19:22.298 --> 00:19:24.840 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: But of course, the
big problem is society has been

00:19:24.840 --> 00:19:25.687 align:middle line:90%
programmed.

00:19:25.687 --> 00:19:26.520 align:middle line:90%
>>DUNWOODY: Exactly.

00:19:26.520 --> 00:19:30.270 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: So the simplicity
of saying, oh, god,

00:19:30.270 --> 00:19:32.320 align:middle line:84%
that sounds wonderful,
yeah, I'd love to do it.

00:19:32.320 --> 00:19:33.120 align:middle line:90%
Oh, no, I can't.

00:19:33.120 --> 00:19:34.140 align:middle line:90%
I've got to get to work.

00:19:34.140 --> 00:19:34.973 align:middle line:90%
I've got to do this.

00:19:34.973 --> 00:19:35.920 align:middle line:90%
I've got to do that.

00:19:35.920 --> 00:19:41.610 align:middle line:84%
So how does a generator
or manifesting generator

00:19:41.610 --> 00:19:46.470 align:middle line:84%
begin the process of breaking
free of the imposed societal

00:19:46.470 --> 00:19:49.470 align:middle line:84%
norms and demands so
that they can literally

00:19:49.470 --> 00:19:51.570 align:middle line:90%
hear that voice of, oh, yes?

00:19:51.570 --> 00:19:52.973 align:middle line:90%
>>DUNWOODY: Yeah, I love that.

00:19:52.973 --> 00:19:54.390 align:middle line:84%
So the first thing
is always play.

00:19:54.390 --> 00:19:56.160 align:middle line:84%
We want to connect
to our sacral.

00:19:56.160 --> 00:19:58.510 align:middle line:84%
And I'm always saying,
we need to play.

00:19:58.510 --> 00:19:59.790 align:middle line:90%
All types need to play.

00:19:59.790 --> 00:20:02.820 align:middle line:84%
But ultimately, we have
to find that enthusiasm.

00:20:02.820 --> 00:20:05.112 align:middle line:84%
We also need to reteach
people how to treat us.

00:20:05.112 --> 00:20:06.570 align:middle line:84%
Because at the end
of the day, when

00:20:06.570 --> 00:20:08.167 align:middle line:84%
we take full
responsibility, we say,

00:20:08.167 --> 00:20:10.500 align:middle line:84%
OK, well, I've actually taught
you to treat me this way.

00:20:10.500 --> 00:20:12.630 align:middle line:84%
I've taught you that you
can put everything on me.

00:20:12.630 --> 00:20:13.430 align:middle line:90%
So.

00:20:13.430 --> 00:20:16.910 align:middle line:10%
It is an uncomfortable journey,
but it is an important one

00:20:16.910 --> 00:20:18.650 align:middle line:10%
of putting boundaries
in place and saying

00:20:18.650 --> 00:20:21.400 align:middle line:10%
no, my sacral-- and you
don't have to say to people,

00:20:21.400 --> 00:20:23.150 align:middle line:10%
no, my sacral says no,
but it's just like,

00:20:23.150 --> 00:20:26.990 align:middle line:10%
no, I can't take that
on, and really starting

00:20:26.990 --> 00:20:28.640 align:middle line:10%
to put boundaries in place.

00:20:28.640 --> 00:20:31.320 align:middle line:84%
The challenge also just to
be aware of is, of course,

00:20:31.320 --> 00:20:32.790 align:middle line:90%
the sacral is simple and easy.

00:20:32.790 --> 00:20:33.590 align:middle line:90%
Uh-huh, uh-uh.

00:20:33.590 --> 00:20:35.412 align:middle line:84%
But the mind isn't,
then the mind jumps in

00:20:35.412 --> 00:20:36.620 align:middle line:90%
and has all of these stories.

00:20:36.620 --> 00:20:38.270 align:middle line:90%
So it's just about practicing.

00:20:38.270 --> 00:20:40.667 align:middle line:84%
Because the more you
act from the sacral,

00:20:40.667 --> 00:20:43.250 align:middle line:84%
the louder the sacral is going
to get and the quieter the mind

00:20:43.250 --> 00:20:44.050 align:middle line:90%
is going to get.

00:20:44.050 --> 00:20:46.460 align:middle line:84%
Because all the brain is
really looking for is evidence.

00:20:46.460 --> 00:20:48.630 align:middle line:84%
It just wants the evidence
that it can trust it.

00:20:48.630 --> 00:20:52.190 align:middle line:84%
And if you keep showing it that,
yes, you can trust the gut,

00:20:52.190 --> 00:20:53.990 align:middle line:84%
then the mind will
get more quiet

00:20:53.990 --> 00:20:56.320 align:middle line:90%
and the gut will get louder.

00:20:56.320 --> 00:20:58.960 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: OK, so that's
generators and we folded

00:20:58.960 --> 00:21:00.430 align:middle line:90%
in there manifesting generators.

00:21:00.430 --> 00:21:02.530 align:middle line:84%
We'll get to pure
manifestors in a second.

00:21:02.530 --> 00:21:05.350 align:middle line:84%
But between those two,
the next is the class

00:21:05.350 --> 00:21:07.390 align:middle line:90%
that's called projectors.

00:21:07.390 --> 00:21:09.670 align:middle line:84%
>>DUNWOODY: Now, our
projectors are our guides.

00:21:09.670 --> 00:21:10.600 align:middle line:90%
These are the people--

00:21:10.600 --> 00:21:13.750 align:middle line:84%
I always love-- in my
head, the projectors

00:21:13.750 --> 00:21:17.007 align:middle line:84%
are the girl in the classroom
who always has the answers.

00:21:17.007 --> 00:21:19.090 align:middle line:84%
And you know that the
teacher says, no, no, Sally,

00:21:19.090 --> 00:21:20.410 align:middle line:90%
give someone else a go.

00:21:20.410 --> 00:21:22.910 align:middle line:84%
And actually, no, Sally is
here to answer the question,

00:21:22.910 --> 00:21:24.910 align:middle line:90%
so let her answer the questions.

00:21:24.910 --> 00:21:26.470 align:middle line:90%
That's what she's here to do.

00:21:26.470 --> 00:21:28.390 align:middle line:90%
Projectors are our guides.

00:21:28.390 --> 00:21:32.527 align:middle line:84%
They see into people in a way
that the other types don't see.

00:21:32.527 --> 00:21:34.360 align:middle line:84%
They can see the way
we're using our energy.

00:21:34.360 --> 00:21:37.040 align:middle line:84%
Is it being used resourcefully
or unresourcefully?

00:21:37.040 --> 00:21:39.560 align:middle line:84%
And projectors have
their specific people.

00:21:39.560 --> 00:21:42.880 align:middle line:84%
So for me, for example, I have
certain projectors in my life.

00:21:42.880 --> 00:21:45.640 align:middle line:84%
And I'm very much
one of their MGs,

00:21:45.640 --> 00:21:47.380 align:middle line:84%
as we call this
Manifesting Generators.

00:21:47.380 --> 00:21:49.740 align:middle line:90%
So they are there to guide us.

00:21:49.740 --> 00:21:51.490 align:middle line:84%
Now, they could be
guiding us in business.

00:21:51.490 --> 00:21:53.350 align:middle line:84%
They could be guiding
us in relationships,

00:21:53.350 --> 00:21:54.950 align:middle line:90%
in friendships, anything.

00:21:54.950 --> 00:21:58.182 align:middle line:84%
But it's really about being
able to see these people,

00:21:58.182 --> 00:22:00.140 align:middle line:84%
because the biggest
challenge for the projector

00:22:00.140 --> 00:22:01.557 align:middle line:84%
is that they see
all these things.

00:22:01.557 --> 00:22:04.730 align:middle line:84%
They're actually on the planet
to be seen and recognized,

00:22:04.730 --> 00:22:07.265 align:middle line:84%
however, they've
never been allowed

00:22:07.265 --> 00:22:09.140 align:middle line:84%
to be seen and recognized
because it's almost

00:22:09.140 --> 00:22:11.182 align:middle line:84%
like it's conditioned out
of them at a young age.

00:22:11.182 --> 00:22:11.982 align:middle line:90%
Don't be bossy.

00:22:11.982 --> 00:22:12.860 align:middle line:90%
Don't be a show-off.

00:22:12.860 --> 00:22:13.520 align:middle line:90%
Don't be this.

00:22:13.520 --> 00:22:14.320 align:middle line:90%
Don't be that.

00:22:14.320 --> 00:22:16.460 align:middle line:84%
So then they get
to this place where

00:22:16.460 --> 00:22:18.300 align:middle line:84%
I've got all this
wisdom inside of me,

00:22:18.300 --> 00:22:19.883 align:middle line:84%
and they want to
force it on everyone.

00:22:19.883 --> 00:22:20.840 align:middle line:90%
Like see me, see me.

00:22:20.840 --> 00:22:23.870 align:middle line:84%
But it's like that completely
deflates their wisdom.

00:22:23.870 --> 00:22:24.990 align:middle line:90%
No one wants to see them.

00:22:24.990 --> 00:22:26.330 align:middle line:90%
No one wants to receive them.

00:22:26.330 --> 00:22:29.960 align:middle line:84%
And it's this art form almost
of then allowing people

00:22:29.960 --> 00:22:31.650 align:middle line:90%
to come back to you.

00:22:31.650 --> 00:22:34.220 align:middle line:84%
And once you get into that
place where you're like,

00:22:34.220 --> 00:22:37.340 align:middle line:84%
you see your worth, and
your value, and your wisdom,

00:22:37.340 --> 00:22:40.910 align:middle line:84%
then the people that
you're here to guide--

00:22:40.910 --> 00:22:43.010 align:middle line:84%
I will sit around my
projectors for hours

00:22:43.010 --> 00:22:44.540 align:middle line:84%
and listen to what
they have to say.

00:22:44.540 --> 00:22:46.970 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: Now, if I may
speak on a personal note,

00:22:46.970 --> 00:22:48.230 align:middle line:90%
I'm a projector.

00:22:48.230 --> 00:22:50.570 align:middle line:84%
And I remember
when I was younger,

00:22:50.570 --> 00:22:52.820 align:middle line:84%
and gathering a
lot of knowledge,

00:22:52.820 --> 00:22:55.070 align:middle line:84%
and my intuition was
kicking in, and I

00:22:55.070 --> 00:22:59.000 align:middle line:84%
was so excited to share
everything with everyone.

00:22:59.000 --> 00:23:02.990 align:middle line:84%
I can say there was nary a
person even remotely interested

00:23:02.990 --> 00:23:05.060 align:middle line:90%
in what I had to say.

00:23:05.060 --> 00:23:06.090 align:middle line:90%
And it was frustrating.

00:23:06.090 --> 00:23:08.150 align:middle line:84%
I thought, no, but
this is so valuable.

00:23:08.150 --> 00:23:11.120 align:middle line:84%
But the point is, with
projectors, there's almost--

00:23:11.120 --> 00:23:15.575 align:middle line:84%
you have to be in a position
to wait to be invited to speak.

00:23:15.575 --> 00:23:17.700 align:middle line:84%
So what happened, as the
years went on, ultimately,

00:23:17.700 --> 00:23:19.610 align:middle line:84%
I started doing what
I'm doing for a living.

00:23:19.610 --> 00:23:23.210 align:middle line:84%
So I offer information
for a living.

00:23:23.210 --> 00:23:25.230 align:middle line:84%
I offer my insights
for a living.

00:23:25.230 --> 00:23:28.920 align:middle line:84%
And then I didn't have to try
to speak to people privately

00:23:28.920 --> 00:23:29.720 align:middle line:90%
anymore.

00:23:29.720 --> 00:23:31.340 align:middle line:90%
It was like, no, I settled in.

00:23:31.340 --> 00:23:32.700 align:middle line:90%
This is who I am.

00:23:32.700 --> 00:23:33.680 align:middle line:90%
This is my job.

00:23:33.680 --> 00:23:36.860 align:middle line:84%
And it's all kind of built
in, baked into the cake.

00:23:36.860 --> 00:23:39.530 align:middle line:84%
But it was very frustrating
in those decades

00:23:39.530 --> 00:23:42.140 align:middle line:84%
where no one cared if
I had something to say.

00:23:42.140 --> 00:23:44.150 align:middle line:84%
I was just the weird
person in the room.

00:23:44.150 --> 00:23:49.010 align:middle line:84%
>>DUNWOODY: And honestly, that's
how so many projectors feel.

00:23:49.010 --> 00:23:52.040 align:middle line:90%
They feel so unseen and unheard.

00:23:52.040 --> 00:23:54.170 align:middle line:84%
And what is beautiful
about your story

00:23:54.170 --> 00:23:57.260 align:middle line:84%
is that it's important for
projectors to focus on what--

00:23:57.260 --> 00:23:59.450 align:middle line:84%
because they all want to
obsess about something.

00:23:59.450 --> 00:24:01.130 align:middle line:84%
They're all like,
what is this thing

00:24:01.130 --> 00:24:02.930 align:middle line:90%
and how can I make it better?

00:24:02.930 --> 00:24:05.960 align:middle line:84%
And when they focus on
that and they just share,

00:24:05.960 --> 00:24:07.460 align:middle line:84%
as they get those--
as you say, it's

00:24:07.460 --> 00:24:09.387 align:middle line:84%
their strategy,
their invitation,

00:24:09.387 --> 00:24:10.970 align:middle line:84%
as they get small
invitations to share

00:24:10.970 --> 00:24:12.680 align:middle line:84%
or they're just
sharing their passion.

00:24:12.680 --> 00:24:14.660 align:middle line:90%
I always say, share it freely.

00:24:14.660 --> 00:24:16.535 align:middle line:84%
Don't worry about
what people do with it

00:24:16.535 --> 00:24:17.660 align:middle line:90%
or even if they pick it up.

00:24:17.660 --> 00:24:18.740 align:middle line:90%
Don't worry about it.

00:24:18.740 --> 00:24:21.230 align:middle line:84%
Just share whatever
you're obsessing about.

00:24:21.230 --> 00:24:23.300 align:middle line:84%
And over time, what
happens is that you

00:24:23.300 --> 00:24:24.740 align:middle line:90%
will flow into that alignment.

00:24:24.740 --> 00:24:28.010 align:middle line:84%
And your example is
perfect because you

00:24:28.010 --> 00:24:30.980 align:middle line:84%
get to do your work,
and ask the questions,

00:24:30.980 --> 00:24:32.780 align:middle line:84%
and share all of
this information,

00:24:32.780 --> 00:24:35.060 align:middle line:84%
but you don't have to ask
anyone to come to you.

00:24:35.060 --> 00:24:36.893 align:middle line:84%
You don't have to push
it on to anyone else.

00:24:36.893 --> 00:24:37.693 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Right.

00:24:37.693 --> 00:24:38.720 align:middle line:90%
Those days are over.

00:24:38.720 --> 00:24:41.090 align:middle line:84%
But the other part
of the projector

00:24:41.090 --> 00:24:43.310 align:middle line:84%
is they don't have
that innate energy

00:24:43.310 --> 00:24:47.930 align:middle line:84%
that a manifestor, manifesting
generator, or generator has.

00:24:47.930 --> 00:24:51.380 align:middle line:84%
And yet, you try to keep up,
keep up with the Joneses, i.e.

00:24:51.380 --> 00:24:53.060 align:middle line:90%
keep up with the generators.

00:24:53.060 --> 00:24:54.690 align:middle line:90%
It's very exhausting.

00:24:54.690 --> 00:24:56.570 align:middle line:84%
>>DUNWOODY: Yeah, it
can be a real challenge.

00:24:56.570 --> 00:24:59.900 align:middle line:84%
I think my mother
was a projector.

00:24:59.900 --> 00:25:03.500 align:middle line:84%
And everyone used to laugh
at her because she worked

00:25:03.500 --> 00:25:05.090 align:middle line:90%
in the media, of all things.

00:25:05.090 --> 00:25:07.492 align:middle line:84%
And she would often sleep
under her desk at lunch time.

00:25:07.492 --> 00:25:09.200 align:middle line:84%
And everyone would
think she's hilarious.

00:25:09.200 --> 00:25:10.910 align:middle line:84%
But in hindsight,
I'm like, wow, well,

00:25:10.910 --> 00:25:13.400 align:middle line:84%
she was just an in
alignment projector.

00:25:13.400 --> 00:25:14.570 align:middle line:90%
She needed the rest.

00:25:14.570 --> 00:25:16.260 align:middle line:90%
She couldn't operate that way.

00:25:16.260 --> 00:25:19.730 align:middle line:84%
So the other thing that is
really important for projectors

00:25:19.730 --> 00:25:22.550 align:middle line:84%
in all of our
non-sacral types, which

00:25:22.550 --> 00:25:25.130 align:middle line:84%
is the manifestor, the
reflector, and the projector,

00:25:25.130 --> 00:25:27.590 align:middle line:84%
is you have to become
really aware of your energy

00:25:27.590 --> 00:25:30.950 align:middle line:84%
and how much you have when
you're in your own aura.

00:25:30.950 --> 00:25:33.630 align:middle line:84%
Because when you're in the aura
of a generator-- and remember,

00:25:33.630 --> 00:25:36.140 align:middle line:84%
70% of the global
population-- you

00:25:36.140 --> 00:25:37.490 align:middle line:90%
think you have all this energy.

00:25:37.490 --> 00:25:40.370 align:middle line:84%
And then you're not in
that aura and it goes away.

00:25:40.370 --> 00:25:41.990 align:middle line:84%
And not only that
is maybe you leave

00:25:41.990 --> 00:25:44.310 align:middle line:84%
the office with all your
generator friends and you

00:25:44.310 --> 00:25:45.110 align:middle line:90%
go home.

00:25:45.110 --> 00:25:47.480 align:middle line:84%
And you're like, wow, I feel
like I've been hit like a bus.

00:25:47.480 --> 00:25:48.510 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Yeah, exactly.

00:25:48.510 --> 00:25:49.940 align:middle line:84%
>>DUNWOODY: And that's
because you've been processing

00:25:49.940 --> 00:25:51.330 align:middle line:90%
everybody else's energy.

00:25:51.330 --> 00:25:53.935 align:middle line:84%
So you have to also have
some sort of ritual, a way

00:25:53.935 --> 00:25:55.310 align:middle line:84%
that you can
cleanse your energy.

00:25:55.310 --> 00:25:56.960 align:middle line:84%
And it could be simple,
as simple as showering

00:25:56.960 --> 00:25:58.835 align:middle line:84%
as soon as you get home,
or going for a swim,

00:25:58.835 --> 00:26:00.200 align:middle line:90%
or walk in nature.

00:26:00.200 --> 00:26:01.783 align:middle line:84%
But it's really
important for you to--

00:26:01.783 --> 00:26:04.242 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: Get your own space
so they're your own thoughts,

00:26:04.242 --> 00:26:05.690 align:middle line:84%
so you have time
to really think.

00:26:05.690 --> 00:26:06.860 align:middle line:90%
>>DUNWOODY: Exactly.

00:26:06.860 --> 00:26:08.420 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: Now, we
go to manifestors,

00:26:08.420 --> 00:26:09.780 align:middle line:90%
and they're a fun lot.

00:26:09.780 --> 00:26:12.317 align:middle line:84%
I didn't understand my
manifestor friends 'til I found

00:26:12.317 --> 00:26:13.400 align:middle line:90%
out they were manifestors.

00:26:13.400 --> 00:26:16.762 align:middle line:84%
And I thought, my god, she
doesn't listen to anyone.

00:26:16.762 --> 00:26:18.470 align:middle line:84%
She just goes off and
does what she does.

00:26:18.470 --> 00:26:20.810 align:middle line:84%
She's just taking
control of everything,

00:26:20.810 --> 00:26:23.317 align:middle line:90%
trying to figure it out.

00:26:23.317 --> 00:26:24.900 align:middle line:84%
So that's what they're
supposed to do.

00:26:24.900 --> 00:26:25.733 align:middle line:90%
>>DUNWOODY: Exactly.

00:26:25.733 --> 00:26:29.870 align:middle line:84%
What they're here to do is to
initiate and inspire people

00:26:29.870 --> 00:26:30.860 align:middle line:90%
into action.

00:26:30.860 --> 00:26:32.690 align:middle line:90%
But they are the child.

00:26:32.690 --> 00:26:35.780 align:middle line:84%
Ra said, just give a
manifestor child a mobile phone

00:26:35.780 --> 00:26:39.050 align:middle line:84%
and they'll be fine,
a very Ra comment.

00:26:39.050 --> 00:26:40.130 align:middle line:90%
I do not advocate that.

00:26:40.130 --> 00:26:41.300 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: He was
very irreverent.

00:26:41.300 --> 00:26:42.100 align:middle line:90%
>>DUNWOODY: Yeah.

00:26:42.100 --> 00:26:44.085 align:middle line:90%
But they are so independent.

00:26:44.085 --> 00:26:45.710 align:middle line:84%
And from a chart
point of view, they're

00:26:45.710 --> 00:26:47.270 align:middle line:84%
energetically
independent, meaning

00:26:47.270 --> 00:26:49.340 align:middle line:84%
that they don't need
someone else's energy

00:26:49.340 --> 00:26:52.110 align:middle line:84%
to get their energy to
that manifestation place.

00:26:52.110 --> 00:26:56.630 align:middle line:84%
So as children, they can
tend to be harder to wrangle.

00:26:56.630 --> 00:26:58.520 align:middle line:84%
They're going to do
what they want to do.

00:26:58.520 --> 00:27:02.468 align:middle line:84%
And that really actually needs
to be supported in the kids.

00:27:02.468 --> 00:27:04.260 align:middle line:84%
And when you have a
manifesting generator--

00:27:04.260 --> 00:27:06.530 align:middle line:84%
I have two MG
children, two boys--

00:27:06.530 --> 00:27:08.300 align:middle line:90%
it's also a fine balance.

00:27:08.300 --> 00:27:12.350 align:middle line:84%
You have to be very careful
that you don't squash that--

00:27:12.350 --> 00:27:18.020 align:middle line:84%
I have to be allowed to
go out and into the world

00:27:18.020 --> 00:27:20.660 align:middle line:84%
and have that freedom,
because freedom and peace are

00:27:20.660 --> 00:27:23.960 align:middle line:84%
a really important part
of being a manifestor.

00:27:23.960 --> 00:27:26.540 align:middle line:84%
And a lot of manifestors,
what will happen is that,

00:27:26.540 --> 00:27:29.480 align:middle line:84%
because they have this big
really big aura-- and again,

00:27:29.480 --> 00:27:31.790 align:middle line:84%
this happens for manifesting
generators as well--

00:27:31.790 --> 00:27:35.210 align:middle line:84%
is that, often, they become
very aware very young

00:27:35.210 --> 00:27:37.190 align:middle line:84%
that they have this
big, impactful aura

00:27:37.190 --> 00:27:40.520 align:middle line:84%
and that it upsets people in
whatever way that might be.

00:27:40.520 --> 00:27:42.540 align:middle line:90%
So they shut themselves down.

00:27:42.540 --> 00:27:46.340 align:middle line:84%
They shut down their power and
they become people pleasers.

00:27:46.340 --> 00:27:49.707 align:middle line:84%
And basically, they just start
to die a little bit inside

00:27:49.707 --> 00:27:51.290 align:middle line:84%
because they're meant
to be very free.

00:27:51.290 --> 00:27:52.832 align:middle line:84%
They're meant to be
out in the world,

00:27:52.832 --> 00:27:56.060 align:middle line:84%
to be lighting the fires,
starting the process,

00:27:56.060 --> 00:27:59.460 align:middle line:84%
being the head of the
movement, whatever it might be.

00:27:59.460 --> 00:28:02.870 align:middle line:84%
So it's a journey for
them to really learn

00:28:02.870 --> 00:28:04.370 align:middle line:90%
to have that freedom again.

00:28:04.370 --> 00:28:06.410 align:middle line:84%
But the key to
being a manifestor

00:28:06.410 --> 00:28:10.460 align:middle line:84%
is part of their strategy
is they must inform.

00:28:10.460 --> 00:28:11.690 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Explain that.

00:28:11.690 --> 00:28:15.140 align:middle line:84%
>>DUNWOODY: Manifestors and
MGs, the big thing is that

00:28:15.140 --> 00:28:16.430 align:middle line:90%
a manifestor isn't--

00:28:16.430 --> 00:28:18.530 align:middle line:84%
it's not about asking
for permission.

00:28:18.530 --> 00:28:20.450 align:middle line:84%
And many manifestors
will come to it and go,

00:28:20.450 --> 00:28:21.950 align:middle line:84%
well, I'm not asking
for permission,

00:28:21.950 --> 00:28:23.960 align:middle line:84%
or they ask for permission
when they shouldn't

00:28:23.960 --> 00:28:25.940 align:middle line:90%
be asking for permission.

00:28:25.940 --> 00:28:28.130 align:middle line:84%
I like to say that
it's declaring

00:28:28.130 --> 00:28:30.570 align:middle line:90%
the direction of your energy.

00:28:30.570 --> 00:28:33.740 align:middle line:84%
So it could be simple as,
I'm going down the street

00:28:33.740 --> 00:28:37.520 align:middle line:84%
to pick up a bag of chips
or I'm going down the street

00:28:37.520 --> 00:28:39.290 align:middle line:90%
to get a green smoothie.

00:28:39.290 --> 00:28:42.080 align:middle line:84%
Or it could be,
I've had this idea,

00:28:42.080 --> 00:28:44.030 align:middle line:84%
I'm thinking of
building this business.

00:28:44.030 --> 00:28:46.040 align:middle line:90%
I'm heading in this direction.

00:28:46.040 --> 00:28:49.460 align:middle line:84%
Now, most manifestors
and MGs, especially

00:28:49.460 --> 00:28:51.260 align:middle line:84%
as they come to
human design, they'll

00:28:51.260 --> 00:28:53.802 align:middle line:84%
be like, god, I actually
go out of my way

00:28:53.802 --> 00:28:55.760 align:middle line:84%
not to inform people
because I'm afraid they're

00:28:55.760 --> 00:28:57.210 align:middle line:90%
going to get in my way.

00:28:57.210 --> 00:28:59.070 align:middle line:84%
And that's all to do
with their energy.

00:28:59.070 --> 00:29:01.220 align:middle line:84%
They actually have
this fear within them

00:29:01.220 --> 00:29:04.110 align:middle line:84%
that, if they tell people,
people are going to stop them.

00:29:04.110 --> 00:29:04.910 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Right.

00:29:04.910 --> 00:29:06.470 align:middle line:90%
And they're going forward.

00:29:06.470 --> 00:29:07.550 align:middle line:90%
>>DUNWOODY: Exactly.

00:29:07.550 --> 00:29:09.592 align:middle line:84%
And the important thing
to understand, especially

00:29:09.592 --> 00:29:14.160 align:middle line:84%
with manifestors, is that you're
going to have your people.

00:29:14.160 --> 00:29:18.050 align:middle line:84%
The knowledge talks about them
being very polarizing energy.

00:29:18.050 --> 00:29:21.120 align:middle line:84%
In my experience, the higher
their consciousness goes,

00:29:21.120 --> 00:29:22.590 align:middle line:90%
the less polarizing they are.

00:29:22.590 --> 00:29:25.220 align:middle line:84%
But they're here for very
specific people, whether it's

00:29:25.220 --> 00:29:26.930 align:middle line:90%
a large group or a few people.

00:29:26.930 --> 00:29:29.720 align:middle line:84%
So it's only important
that those specific people

00:29:29.720 --> 00:29:32.420 align:middle line:84%
follow them because they're the
ones they're here to inspire.

00:29:32.420 --> 00:29:34.670 align:middle line:84%
And it's important that the
others don't, because they

00:29:34.670 --> 00:29:35.940 align:middle line:90%
can't be wasting their energy.

00:29:35.940 --> 00:29:38.720 align:middle line:84%
They don't have a defined sacral
to be wasting all this energy

00:29:38.720 --> 00:29:40.730 align:middle line:84%
on with people that
they're not actually here

00:29:40.730 --> 00:29:42.830 align:middle line:90%
to inspire into action.

00:29:42.830 --> 00:29:45.860 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: Yeah, I found that
I've really grown to just

00:29:45.860 --> 00:29:49.280 align:middle line:84%
deeply respect my
manifestor friends.

00:29:49.280 --> 00:29:50.600 align:middle line:90%
They're a force.

00:29:50.600 --> 00:29:53.450 align:middle line:84%
And the whole notion
of just informing,

00:29:53.450 --> 00:29:55.400 align:middle line:84%
otherwise, they just
kind of disappear.

00:29:55.400 --> 00:29:57.210 align:middle line:90%
You don't know what happened.

00:29:57.210 --> 00:30:00.370 align:middle line:84%
They don't explain anything
to anyone, which they do.

00:30:00.370 --> 00:30:03.250 align:middle line:84%
And so now, we've begun
learning together.

00:30:03.250 --> 00:30:05.650 align:middle line:84%
Just let me know what's
going to happen next.

00:30:05.650 --> 00:30:07.320 align:middle line:84%
And I find that
there's just so much

00:30:07.320 --> 00:30:11.490 align:middle line:84%
creativity and energy that pours
out of it, so much research.

00:30:11.490 --> 00:30:13.955 align:middle line:84%
I'll say one thing, and they're
already on looking it up.

00:30:13.955 --> 00:30:16.080 align:middle line:84%
And like, OK, we can do
this, this, this, and this.

00:30:16.080 --> 00:30:16.860 align:middle line:90%
It's like, thank you.

00:30:16.860 --> 00:30:17.660 align:middle line:90%
That's great.

00:30:17.660 --> 00:30:20.250 align:middle line:90%
You saved me the energy.

00:30:20.250 --> 00:30:24.480 align:middle line:84%
So they're very powerful, very
powerful creators, manifestors.

00:30:24.480 --> 00:30:28.012 align:middle line:84%
So now, let's go to the one
that's, what, 1% of society?

00:30:28.012 --> 00:30:29.220 align:middle line:90%
>>DUNWOODY: Yeah, reflectors.

00:30:29.220 --> 00:30:31.890 align:middle line:10%
>> REGINA: Reflectors, which
is, when you look at a chart--

00:30:31.890 --> 00:30:35.100 align:middle line:10%
here's the chart we're going to
look at of a reflector-- oops,

00:30:35.100 --> 00:30:36.990 align:middle line:10%
nothing is filled in.

00:30:36.990 --> 00:30:38.115 align:middle line:10%
What the heck?

00:30:38.115 --> 00:30:40.800 align:middle line:84%
>>DUNWOODY: Yeah, well,
they are, as I said, 1%.

00:30:40.800 --> 00:30:42.580 align:middle line:84%
They're just this
very small group.

00:30:42.580 --> 00:30:45.810 align:middle line:84%
However, they have a very
important role to play.

00:30:45.810 --> 00:30:49.050 align:middle line:84%
Ultimately, their role to play,
if manifestors are inspiring us

00:30:49.050 --> 00:30:50.970 align:middle line:84%
into action, and
generators are manifesting,

00:30:50.970 --> 00:30:53.880 align:middle line:84%
generators are building, and
the projectors are improving

00:30:53.880 --> 00:30:56.490 align:middle line:84%
on everything so
far, the reflectors

00:30:56.490 --> 00:30:59.250 align:middle line:84%
are reflecting back where we're
at, where we're actually at.

00:30:59.250 --> 00:31:00.910 align:middle line:90%
What is the truth of the matter?

00:31:00.910 --> 00:31:02.700 align:middle line:84%
It's like, once we
reflect back and we

00:31:02.700 --> 00:31:05.220 align:middle line:84%
see the truth of where we're
at, it's like rinse and repeat.

00:31:05.220 --> 00:31:07.120 align:middle line:90%
Let's go around the cycle again.

00:31:07.120 --> 00:31:09.030 align:middle line:84%
So they are very,
very important.

00:31:09.030 --> 00:31:13.890 align:middle line:84%
If you have a happy, healthy,
well connected reflector

00:31:13.890 --> 00:31:17.230 align:middle line:84%
in your friendship
group or business,

00:31:17.230 --> 00:31:19.410 align:middle line:90%
then you know you're on track.

00:31:19.410 --> 00:31:23.020 align:middle line:90%
It's a really good sign.

00:31:23.020 --> 00:31:27.540 align:middle line:84%
However, if you have a reflector
that you feel like is lost,

00:31:27.540 --> 00:31:30.090 align:middle line:84%
and flip-flops a
lot, and doesn't

00:31:30.090 --> 00:31:33.360 align:middle line:84%
know who they are, or feels like
they have to prove themselves,

00:31:33.360 --> 00:31:35.550 align:middle line:84%
then, all of a sudden,
like, OK, wow, they're

00:31:35.550 --> 00:31:38.940 align:middle line:84%
probably reflecting back
what's going on in here.

00:31:38.940 --> 00:31:40.002 align:middle line:90%
There's work to be done.

00:31:40.002 --> 00:31:41.460 align:middle line:84%
The other thing
about the reflector

00:31:41.460 --> 00:31:44.080 align:middle line:84%
is they are incredible
at seeing energy.

00:31:44.080 --> 00:31:47.560 align:middle line:84%
So they can see this nuance
of energy, very different

00:31:47.560 --> 00:31:48.360 align:middle line:90%
to the projector.

00:31:48.360 --> 00:31:51.720 align:middle line:84%
The projector, it's
almost like this very--

00:31:51.720 --> 00:31:53.400 align:middle line:90%
I often say like Yoda.

00:31:53.400 --> 00:31:55.960 align:middle line:90%
It's like Yoda, just know.

00:31:55.960 --> 00:31:57.520 align:middle line:84%
You're not quite
with the force yet.

00:31:57.520 --> 00:31:59.440 align:middle line:84%
Whereas the reflector
is almost like

00:31:59.440 --> 00:32:01.750 align:middle line:84%
they can see the cycles
coming or they can see

00:32:01.750 --> 00:32:04.420 align:middle line:90%
a very deep shadow in someone.

00:32:04.420 --> 00:32:08.800 align:middle line:84%
So they're very, very, very
connected to subtle energy.

00:32:08.800 --> 00:32:12.100 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: The only reflector
I've known well was a genius

00:32:12.100 --> 00:32:13.600 align:middle line:90%
of a healer.

00:32:13.600 --> 00:32:16.000 align:middle line:84%
Theoretically, they were
a physical therapist,

00:32:16.000 --> 00:32:17.830 align:middle line:84%
but they understood
energy and how

00:32:17.830 --> 00:32:20.650 align:middle line:84%
to heal in the most
creative ways I've seen.

00:32:20.650 --> 00:32:22.390 align:middle line:90%
So that would probably be--

00:32:22.390 --> 00:32:23.960 align:middle line:84%
>>DUNWOODY: And
that's it spot on.

00:32:23.960 --> 00:32:26.920 align:middle line:84%
And I think one of the
challenges with a reflector

00:32:26.920 --> 00:32:28.690 align:middle line:84%
is, obviously, that
person's like, they

00:32:28.690 --> 00:32:32.410 align:middle line:84%
found their alignment
within their work.

00:32:32.410 --> 00:32:35.950 align:middle line:84%
However, let's say,
their relationship, it

00:32:35.950 --> 00:32:37.810 align:middle line:84%
isn't a high quality
relationship,

00:32:37.810 --> 00:32:40.570 align:middle line:84%
then that reflector is going
to live a very different life

00:32:40.570 --> 00:32:42.350 align:middle line:90%
in other areas of their life.

00:32:42.350 --> 00:32:45.250 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: So we have these
charts and we've seen some here

00:32:45.250 --> 00:32:48.400 align:middle line:84%
where you've got some filled
in, some not filled in.

00:32:48.400 --> 00:32:50.530 align:middle line:84%
What happens when someone
has everything filled in?

00:32:50.530 --> 00:32:52.090 align:middle line:90%
Does that happen very often?

00:32:52.090 --> 00:32:53.630 align:middle line:90%
>>DUNWOODY: It's very rare.

00:32:53.630 --> 00:32:57.460 align:middle line:84%
I think it's also 1% or
2% of the population.

00:32:57.460 --> 00:33:00.160 align:middle line:84%
I actually-- the first
ever mastermind I ever

00:33:00.160 --> 00:33:02.170 align:middle line:90%
ran was a fully defined person.

00:33:02.170 --> 00:33:03.880 align:middle line:90%
I was like, wow, this is epic.

00:33:03.880 --> 00:33:05.980 align:middle line:84%
I'm so grateful
to have you here.

00:33:05.980 --> 00:33:08.410 align:middle line:84%
And what that means is
they just have a very--

00:33:08.410 --> 00:33:10.420 align:middle line:84%
they're probably going
to be a person that feels

00:33:10.420 --> 00:33:12.310 align:middle line:90%
very certain to be around.

00:33:12.310 --> 00:33:14.290 align:middle line:90%
It's a very consistent--

00:33:14.290 --> 00:33:17.500 align:middle line:84%
people trust them because
trust comes from consistency.

00:33:17.500 --> 00:33:20.110 align:middle line:84%
So they just have a very
consistent way of being,

00:33:20.110 --> 00:33:23.410 align:middle line:84%
because where we're colored
in, it's who we feel we are

00:33:23.410 --> 00:33:25.270 align:middle line:84%
and it's how other
people see us.

00:33:25.270 --> 00:33:27.282 align:middle line:84%
Where we have those
white centers,

00:33:27.282 --> 00:33:29.740 align:middle line:84%
this is where we're taking in
and amplifying other people's

00:33:29.740 --> 00:33:30.540 align:middle line:90%
energy.

00:33:30.540 --> 00:33:34.210 align:middle line:84%
So this is where maybe we're
empathic, or we're intuitive,

00:33:34.210 --> 00:33:38.057 align:middle line:84%
or we just experienced
our energetic gifts,

00:33:38.057 --> 00:33:39.140 align:middle line:90%
or whatever that might be.

00:33:39.140 --> 00:33:40.400 align:middle line:90%
So it's a lot more fluid.

00:33:40.400 --> 00:33:43.570 align:middle line:84%
We're influenced by others
in those undefined centers.

00:33:43.570 --> 00:33:46.330 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: And then when you
get together with other people

00:33:46.330 --> 00:33:49.960 align:middle line:84%
and you put your charts
together, you might have, say,

00:33:49.960 --> 00:33:53.200 align:middle line:84%
all of them defined where
each of you have half of them.

00:33:53.200 --> 00:33:54.610 align:middle line:90%
Now, you have them all defined.

00:33:54.610 --> 00:33:57.370 align:middle line:84%
What would that bode
for a relationship?

00:33:57.370 --> 00:33:59.080 align:middle line:84%
>>DUNWOODY: Well,
they actually have--

00:33:59.080 --> 00:34:01.670 align:middle line:84%
if you put-- let's say, you
put your two charts together,

00:34:01.670 --> 00:34:05.120 align:middle line:84%
what you're really looking
for is what isn't defined.

00:34:05.120 --> 00:34:07.677 align:middle line:84%
So you might have
no centers defined.

00:34:07.677 --> 00:34:09.219 align:middle line:84%
And that really
means that it's going

00:34:09.219 --> 00:34:11.469 align:middle line:84%
to be one of these relationships
that does feel very--

00:34:11.469 --> 00:34:13.960 align:middle line:84%
I have a relationship like
that with my eldest son.

00:34:13.960 --> 00:34:16.219 align:middle line:90%
And it just feels very easy.

00:34:16.219 --> 00:34:18.610 align:middle line:84%
It feels very easy because
everything just kind of plugs

00:34:18.610 --> 00:34:19.420 align:middle line:90%
in.

00:34:19.420 --> 00:34:21.127 align:middle line:90%
We're very consistent.

00:34:21.127 --> 00:34:22.960 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: You're saying
it's all filled in?

00:34:22.960 --> 00:34:24.670 align:middle line:84%
>>DUNWOODY: All of our
centers are all filled in.

00:34:24.670 --> 00:34:26.239 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: Yeah, all the
centers are filled in.

00:34:26.239 --> 00:34:28.210 align:middle line:84%
>>DUNWOODY: So it's
almost a very-- it's

00:34:28.210 --> 00:34:30.010 align:middle line:90%
a very consistent relationship.

00:34:30.010 --> 00:34:33.380 align:middle line:84%
Now, that's not
actually very common.

00:34:33.380 --> 00:34:35.600 align:middle line:84%
Most people are going
to have at least one,

00:34:35.600 --> 00:34:38.590 align:middle line:84%
maybe two, maybe three maybe
four centers undefined when

00:34:38.590 --> 00:34:39.760 align:middle line:90%
you put the two together.

00:34:39.760 --> 00:34:42.489 align:middle line:84%
When you have that undefined
center, or the white center,

00:34:42.489 --> 00:34:44.630 align:middle line:90%
that's your area of growth.

00:34:44.630 --> 00:34:46.190 align:middle line:90%
So what does that mean?

00:34:46.190 --> 00:34:48.880 align:middle line:84%
That means that, let's say,
you have a relationship that

00:34:48.880 --> 00:34:51.130 align:middle line:84%
has still has the
G center, which

00:34:51.130 --> 00:34:54.670 align:middle line:84%
is the diamond in the middle,
it means that that relationship

00:34:54.670 --> 00:34:56.940 align:middle line:90%
is going to be--

00:34:56.940 --> 00:35:00.150 align:middle line:84%
where the inconsistency, where
the growth is going to come

00:35:00.150 --> 00:35:01.740 align:middle line:84%
is going to be all
about lovability,

00:35:01.740 --> 00:35:04.110 align:middle line:84%
because the G center is
all about lovability.

00:35:04.110 --> 00:35:06.217 align:middle line:84%
So maybe you come together
and it feels great.

00:35:06.217 --> 00:35:07.800 align:middle line:84%
And then you're
probably going to have

00:35:07.800 --> 00:35:09.900 align:middle line:84%
to work on lovability
in that relationship.

00:35:09.900 --> 00:35:11.952 align:middle line:84%
It's going to be a
significant journey for you.

00:35:11.952 --> 00:35:14.160 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: What about, say,
if your emotions are both

00:35:14.160 --> 00:35:15.400 align:middle line:90%
undefined?

00:35:15.400 --> 00:35:16.170 align:middle line:84%
>>DUNWOODY: So
you're going to have

00:35:16.170 --> 00:35:17.712 align:middle line:84%
to-- because if you
two come together

00:35:17.712 --> 00:35:19.712 align:middle line:84%
and you've got an undefined
solar plexus, what's

00:35:19.712 --> 00:35:21.212 align:middle line:84%
going to happen is
that you're going

00:35:21.212 --> 00:35:22.440 align:middle line:90%
to have to work on emotions.

00:35:22.440 --> 00:35:24.600 align:middle line:84%
You're going to have to
work on maybe clearing out

00:35:24.600 --> 00:35:27.270 align:middle line:84%
others or the patterns
that you've learned,

00:35:27.270 --> 00:35:29.430 align:middle line:84%
maybe bringing home
other people's emotions.

00:35:29.430 --> 00:35:31.260 align:middle line:90%
But it could be the other side--

00:35:31.260 --> 00:35:33.480 align:middle line:84%
maybe you grew up
in a family that

00:35:33.480 --> 00:35:36.780 align:middle line:84%
was very balanced emotionally,
and you're in a relationship,

00:35:36.780 --> 00:35:40.350 align:middle line:84%
and you're like, wow, I
should feel different to this.

00:35:40.350 --> 00:35:42.030 align:middle line:84%
But you're two
unemotional people,

00:35:42.030 --> 00:35:43.140 align:middle line:90%
so you actually get to--

00:35:43.140 --> 00:35:46.650 align:middle line:84%
OK, well, maybe we don't
have those big emotions

00:35:46.650 --> 00:35:47.650 align:middle line:90%
when we're together.

00:35:47.650 --> 00:35:48.900 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Thank you for that.

00:35:48.900 --> 00:35:51.570 align:middle line:84%
Now, someone like yourself
that is very familiar

00:35:51.570 --> 00:35:54.390 align:middle line:84%
and can really dive deep
into it, there are layers.

00:35:54.390 --> 00:35:55.840 align:middle line:84%
Now, what we've
been talking about

00:35:55.840 --> 00:35:57.430 align:middle line:84%
is right there for
anybody to see when

00:35:57.430 --> 00:35:58.638 align:middle line:90%
they pull their own chart up.

00:35:58.638 --> 00:36:00.460 align:middle line:90%
Where can they go to get charts?

00:36:00.460 --> 00:36:01.660 align:middle line:90%
I know a couple places.

00:36:01.660 --> 00:36:04.077 align:middle line:10%
>>DUNWOODY: They can go to my
website and get a free chart

00:36:04.077 --> 00:36:05.015 align:middle line:10%
and easy as that.

00:36:05.015 --> 00:36:07.390 align:middle line:10%
>> REGINA: OK, so anybody can
go on and get a free chart,

00:36:07.390 --> 00:36:10.720 align:middle line:10%
and start looking at yourselves
and seeing what's filled out.

00:36:10.720 --> 00:36:14.000 align:middle line:84%
But it takes some study and
you need a little guidance.

00:36:14.000 --> 00:36:14.800 align:middle line:90%
Right?

00:36:14.800 --> 00:36:15.600 align:middle line:90%
>>DUNWOODY: Yeah.

00:36:15.600 --> 00:36:18.670 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: So let's go into
some other layers that I found

00:36:18.670 --> 00:36:23.260 align:middle line:84%
fascinating, which is we also
are defined in how our minds

00:36:23.260 --> 00:36:27.220 align:middle line:84%
work, whether we're a very
fast processor of information--

00:36:27.220 --> 00:36:31.150 align:middle line:84%
I think you say processor-- or
whether we're a slow processor.

00:36:31.150 --> 00:36:34.780 align:middle line:84%
And this has nothing to do
with IQ or intelligence.

00:36:34.780 --> 00:36:38.383 align:middle line:84%
It's the speed at which the
brain is taking in something.

00:36:38.383 --> 00:36:40.300 align:middle line:84%
Talk about this, because,
sometimes, we think,

00:36:40.300 --> 00:36:41.825 align:middle line:90%
god, why are they so slow?

00:36:41.825 --> 00:36:44.200 align:middle line:84%
>>DUNWOODY: And I love that
you said this because there's

00:36:44.200 --> 00:36:46.960 align:middle line:90%
so many layers to this as well.

00:36:46.960 --> 00:36:49.480 align:middle line:84%
What you're referring to,
we find in our arrows.

00:36:49.480 --> 00:36:51.820 align:middle line:84%
When we look at our chart,
there's four arrows.

00:36:51.820 --> 00:36:54.010 align:middle line:84%
Some charts have
them, some don't.

00:36:54.010 --> 00:36:57.040 align:middle line:10%
And if we have a chart, if
we have an arrow to the left,

00:36:57.040 --> 00:36:58.540 align:middle line:10%
that's going to
tell us that we have

00:36:58.540 --> 00:37:01.360 align:middle line:10%
this focused, strategic mind.

00:37:01.360 --> 00:37:03.550 align:middle line:10%
It's going to
process information.

00:37:03.550 --> 00:37:04.810 align:middle line:10%
It likes to lock on to things.

00:37:04.810 --> 00:37:06.640 align:middle line:10%
There actually tend
to be people that--

00:37:06.640 --> 00:37:08.260 align:middle line:10%
and I actually have this arrow--

00:37:08.260 --> 00:37:12.010 align:middle line:10%
that you almost forget to get up
and eat or go to the bathroom,

00:37:12.010 --> 00:37:14.170 align:middle line:10%
because once you're in
there and you're processing,

00:37:14.170 --> 00:37:15.310 align:middle line:10%
you don't even think.

00:37:15.310 --> 00:37:17.570 align:middle line:84%
It's almost like you
miss the body cues.

00:37:17.570 --> 00:37:20.500 align:middle line:84%
Now, if on top of that,
you have definition

00:37:20.500 --> 00:37:23.530 align:middle line:84%
in the head and the
ajna, then you're

00:37:23.530 --> 00:37:26.860 align:middle line:84%
already three steps ahead of
the other people in the room

00:37:26.860 --> 00:37:29.440 align:middle line:90%
with undefined heads and ajnas.

00:37:29.440 --> 00:37:31.047 align:middle line:84%
So you're actually
in this situation

00:37:31.047 --> 00:37:33.130 align:middle line:84%
where you're influencing
the thinking of the room.

00:37:33.130 --> 00:37:34.420 align:middle line:90%
You're three steps ahead.

00:37:34.420 --> 00:37:37.160 align:middle line:84%
Your processing is much
faster than anyone else's.

00:37:37.160 --> 00:37:39.850 align:middle line:84%
And it's kind of like, wow,
what's going on in here?

00:37:39.850 --> 00:37:42.760 align:middle line:84%
Whereas when you're
a slower processor,

00:37:42.760 --> 00:37:44.600 align:middle line:90%
it's all about receptivity.

00:37:44.600 --> 00:37:46.730 align:middle line:84%
It's about as the
information comes in.

00:37:46.730 --> 00:37:49.420 align:middle line:84%
And these people just
have to be really focused,

00:37:49.420 --> 00:37:50.920 align:middle line:90%
have to be in the moment.

00:37:50.920 --> 00:37:53.350 align:middle line:84%
They have to be receiving
the information.

00:37:53.350 --> 00:37:55.990 align:middle line:84%
And it can actually be hard for
them to access that information

00:37:55.990 --> 00:37:56.790 align:middle line:90%
sometimes.

00:37:56.790 --> 00:38:00.070 align:middle line:84%
For example, my eldest son
is what we call a quad right.

00:38:00.070 --> 00:38:02.210 align:middle line:84%
So all of his arrows
go to the right.

00:38:02.210 --> 00:38:04.570 align:middle line:84%
And being at school,
I was like, he's

00:38:04.570 --> 00:38:07.558 align:middle line:84%
not designed for normal
school, if you like.

00:38:07.558 --> 00:38:09.100 align:middle line:84%
So I always said to
him, all you need

00:38:09.100 --> 00:38:12.228 align:middle line:84%
to do is just be
really, really present.

00:38:12.228 --> 00:38:14.770 align:middle line:84%
If you're really present, you'll
take in everything you need.

00:38:14.770 --> 00:38:16.885 align:middle line:84%
It was a game changer
for him because he

00:38:16.885 --> 00:38:18.760 align:middle line:84%
would be putting all
this pressure on himself

00:38:18.760 --> 00:38:21.058 align:middle line:84%
to try and work it out,
whereas, if he could just

00:38:21.058 --> 00:38:23.350 align:middle line:84%
stay there and be present
with the teacher or whatever,

00:38:23.350 --> 00:38:25.600 align:middle line:84%
his study partner was
saying, all of a sudden,

00:38:25.600 --> 00:38:28.093 align:middle line:84%
he was retaining all of this
information differently.

00:38:28.093 --> 00:38:30.010 align:middle line:84%
The other thing that's
important to understand

00:38:30.010 --> 00:38:33.138 align:middle line:84%
is these people who
have definition colored

00:38:33.138 --> 00:38:34.180 align:middle line:90%
in the head and the ajna.

00:38:34.180 --> 00:38:35.980 align:middle line:84%
They're influencing
the thinking of a room.

00:38:35.980 --> 00:38:37.900 align:middle line:84%
So wherever we
have definition, we

00:38:37.900 --> 00:38:40.417 align:middle line:84%
want to be responsible for
that, because we're going

00:38:40.417 --> 00:38:41.500 align:middle line:90%
to influence those people.

00:38:41.500 --> 00:38:42.880 align:middle line:90%
It's the same with emotions.

00:38:42.880 --> 00:38:44.380 align:middle line:84%
Take responsibility
for the emotions

00:38:44.380 --> 00:38:46.000 align:middle line:90%
we're bringing into the room.

00:38:46.000 --> 00:38:47.740 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: Because you're going
to have an inordinate impact

00:38:47.740 --> 00:38:49.870 align:middle line:84%
on everyone around you,
especially those who are

00:38:49.870 --> 00:38:51.197 align:middle line:90%
undefined in those areas.

00:38:51.197 --> 00:38:52.030 align:middle line:90%
>>DUNWOODY: Exactly.

00:38:52.030 --> 00:38:54.322 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: OK, another one
that I found interesting was

00:38:54.322 --> 00:38:58.300 align:middle line:84%
the notion of whether you're
an active or passive person.

00:38:58.300 --> 00:39:00.910 align:middle line:84%
And that's kind of
interesting, those definitions

00:39:00.910 --> 00:39:02.230 align:middle line:90%
in themselves.

00:39:02.230 --> 00:39:05.290 align:middle line:84%
And it came about because
my friend was reading

00:39:05.290 --> 00:39:06.460 align:middle line:90%
for a group of three of us.

00:39:06.460 --> 00:39:08.500 align:middle line:84%
And one of them just
has to go, go, go.

00:39:08.500 --> 00:39:10.610 align:middle line:84%
Everything has to be
structured and go.

00:39:10.610 --> 00:39:13.120 align:middle line:84%
It's like, can't we just
chill and have a cup of tea?

00:39:13.120 --> 00:39:15.530 align:middle line:84%
And the answer is,
no, not really.

00:39:15.530 --> 00:39:16.940 align:middle line:90%
And he was explaining why.

00:39:16.940 --> 00:39:18.970 align:middle line:84%
So let's talk about
active versus passive.

00:39:18.970 --> 00:39:21.770 align:middle line:84%
>>DUNWOODY: Yeah, again,
this is in our arrows.

00:39:21.770 --> 00:39:23.500 align:middle line:84%
And what it tells
us is that we have

00:39:23.500 --> 00:39:25.120 align:middle line:90%
an active or a passive body.

00:39:25.120 --> 00:39:27.430 align:middle line:84%
And what's really
helpful about this is,

00:39:27.430 --> 00:39:29.660 align:middle line:84%
because it does go
down into the details,

00:39:29.660 --> 00:39:31.780 align:middle line:84%
it really helps someone
like me, for example.

00:39:31.780 --> 00:39:33.430 align:middle line:84%
I'm a manifesting
generator, and I'm

00:39:33.430 --> 00:39:35.500 align:middle line:84%
told that I am this
Energizer bunny.

00:39:35.500 --> 00:39:37.070 align:middle line:84%
I have all the
energy in the world.

00:39:37.070 --> 00:39:38.207 align:middle line:90%
I can do all the things.

00:39:38.207 --> 00:39:39.790 align:middle line:84%
But when I first
came to human design,

00:39:39.790 --> 00:39:42.978 align:middle line:84%
I was like, well,
that's true sometimes.

00:39:42.978 --> 00:39:44.770 align:middle line:84%
And then when I started
to understand this,

00:39:44.770 --> 00:39:46.430 align:middle line:90%
I have a passive body.

00:39:46.430 --> 00:39:49.780 align:middle line:84%
So I have this real
polarity in so many areas

00:39:49.780 --> 00:39:51.850 align:middle line:84%
of my chart with
my passive body,

00:39:51.850 --> 00:39:55.900 align:middle line:84%
for example, that I am someone
who I get up very early.

00:39:55.900 --> 00:39:56.900 align:middle line:90%
I do a lot of exercise.

00:39:56.900 --> 00:39:57.700 align:middle line:90%
I go to the gym.

00:39:57.700 --> 00:39:58.750 align:middle line:90%
I have a horse.

00:39:58.750 --> 00:39:59.560 align:middle line:90%
I ride my horse.

00:39:59.560 --> 00:40:01.120 align:middle line:84%
But then for the
rest of the day,

00:40:01.120 --> 00:40:04.240 align:middle line:84%
I am very happy to sit at
my desk and do my work.

00:40:04.240 --> 00:40:06.670 align:middle line:90%
My body thrives in that--

00:40:06.670 --> 00:40:07.630 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Quiet state.

00:40:07.630 --> 00:40:08.463 align:middle line:90%
>>DUNWOODY: Exactly.

00:40:08.463 --> 00:40:11.410 align:middle line:84%
There's so many of my
clients and colleagues

00:40:11.410 --> 00:40:13.210 align:middle line:84%
who, they might
stand at their desk

00:40:13.210 --> 00:40:16.670 align:middle line:84%
on their treadmill or this--
and I couldn't think of anything

00:40:16.670 --> 00:40:17.470 align:middle line:90%
worse.

00:40:17.470 --> 00:40:17.890 align:middle line:90%
I'm like--

00:40:17.890 --> 00:40:19.223 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: But those are active.

00:40:19.223 --> 00:40:20.170 align:middle line:90%
>>DUNWOODY: Exactly.

00:40:20.170 --> 00:40:23.950 align:middle line:84%
And when the body is active
and you have this active arrow,

00:40:23.950 --> 00:40:25.450 align:middle line:84%
it's going to help
you think better,

00:40:25.450 --> 00:40:27.280 align:middle line:84%
and it's the same
with the passive.

00:40:27.280 --> 00:40:31.010 align:middle line:84%
So when I allow myself that
passive state, then, of course,

00:40:31.010 --> 00:40:32.980 align:middle line:84%
everything else
is easier for me.

00:40:32.980 --> 00:40:34.580 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Thank you for that.

00:40:34.580 --> 00:40:35.960 align:middle line:90%
There are so many of these.

00:40:35.960 --> 00:40:37.460 align:middle line:84%
And as you said
earlier-- and I just

00:40:37.460 --> 00:40:40.140 align:middle line:84%
want to get to it before we
wrap it up-- and that is,

00:40:40.140 --> 00:40:42.640 align:middle line:84%
you say when you're looking at
your chart for the first time

00:40:42.640 --> 00:40:44.590 align:middle line:84%
as a beginner, the
most important parts

00:40:44.590 --> 00:40:47.132 align:middle line:84%
to look at are your strategy
and authority, and explain that.

00:40:47.132 --> 00:40:49.007 align:middle line:84%
>>DUNWOODY: So I like
to explain it this way.

00:40:49.007 --> 00:40:50.560 align:middle line:84%
Your strategy is
kind of like the way

00:40:50.560 --> 00:40:51.850 align:middle line:90%
the universe speaks to you.

00:40:51.850 --> 00:40:54.130 align:middle line:84%
Your authority is your
internal guidance system

00:40:54.130 --> 00:40:57.550 align:middle line:84%
and it's the communication
loop that's constantly moving.

00:40:57.550 --> 00:40:59.530 align:middle line:84%
We find our strategy
from our type.

00:40:59.530 --> 00:41:03.790 align:middle line:84%
So of course, for you, the
strategy is to be invited.

00:41:03.790 --> 00:41:06.430 align:middle line:84%
For me, it's to be in
response and to inform.

00:41:06.430 --> 00:41:10.258 align:middle line:84%
For a manifestor, that is
to initiate and inform.

00:41:10.258 --> 00:41:11.800 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: And what
about reflectors?

00:41:11.800 --> 00:41:15.100 align:middle line:84%
>>DUNWOODY: Well, they have
to wait a 28 day lunar cycle.

00:41:15.100 --> 00:41:16.780 align:middle line:84%
Because they don't
have definition,

00:41:16.780 --> 00:41:18.460 align:middle line:84%
they actually have
to wait for the moon

00:41:18.460 --> 00:41:20.320 align:middle line:84%
to move all the way
through their chart

00:41:20.320 --> 00:41:23.380 align:middle line:84%
so that they can know how
they really feel about things.

00:41:23.380 --> 00:41:25.370 align:middle line:90%
They have to wait that 28 days.

00:41:25.370 --> 00:41:26.170 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Wow.

00:41:26.170 --> 00:41:27.430 align:middle line:90%
That takes some patience.

00:41:27.430 --> 00:41:28.535 align:middle line:90%
>>DUNWOODY: Yes.

00:41:28.535 --> 00:41:30.160 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: So we're
almost out of time.

00:41:30.160 --> 00:41:31.400 align:middle line:90%
You have a podcast, right?

00:41:31.400 --> 00:41:32.200 align:middle line:90%
>>DUNWOODY: Yes.

00:41:32.200 --> 00:41:34.510 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: So people can
kind of dial in and find out

00:41:34.510 --> 00:41:36.385 align:middle line:84%
what's going on by
listening to your podcast.

00:41:36.385 --> 00:41:38.560 align:middle line:10%
They can go get a
free chart there.

00:41:38.560 --> 00:41:41.800 align:middle line:10%
And I think the beauty of it--
and I would like you to make

00:41:41.800 --> 00:41:42.920 align:middle line:10%
your final thoughts--

00:41:42.920 --> 00:41:45.370 align:middle line:10%
I think the beauty of it is
it helps us to see ourselves

00:41:45.370 --> 00:41:49.030 align:middle line:10%
and others more clearly so
we can have more compassion

00:41:49.030 --> 00:41:50.470 align:middle line:10%
and everything settles down.

00:41:50.470 --> 00:41:51.800 align:middle line:90%
Drop judgment.

00:41:51.800 --> 00:41:53.830 align:middle line:84%
We're just more
accepting of each other.

00:41:53.830 --> 00:41:57.040 align:middle line:84%
That's what I find
about the beauty in it.

00:41:57.040 --> 00:41:58.090 align:middle line:90%
What about you?

00:41:58.090 --> 00:42:01.310 align:middle line:84%
>>DUNWOODY: I actually think
that is absolutely spot on.

00:42:01.310 --> 00:42:03.730 align:middle line:10%
I know, for me, in all
of my relationships,

00:42:03.730 --> 00:42:06.400 align:middle line:10%
even in my marriage,
everything changed

00:42:06.400 --> 00:42:10.000 align:middle line:10%
because what is so important
is that we see the world,

00:42:10.000 --> 00:42:13.610 align:middle line:10%
our brain is set up to see the
world as we are, not as it is.

00:42:13.610 --> 00:42:17.080 align:middle line:84%
And what human design
gives us is the ability not

00:42:17.080 --> 00:42:18.970 align:middle line:84%
only to treat people
as we perceive

00:42:18.970 --> 00:42:21.190 align:middle line:84%
they want to be treated,
but even better than that.

00:42:21.190 --> 00:42:24.610 align:middle line:84%
We get to treat people as
they're designed to be treated.

00:42:24.610 --> 00:42:28.325 align:middle line:84%
We get to see them truly as
they are and who they are.

00:42:28.325 --> 00:42:30.700 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: It's quite a gift
and we all have Ra to thank.

00:42:30.700 --> 00:42:31.785 align:middle line:90%
He's no longer with us.

00:42:31.785 --> 00:42:33.910 align:middle line:84%
And then we have Richard
Red who carried it forward

00:42:33.910 --> 00:42:34.570 align:middle line:90%
into gene keys.

00:42:34.570 --> 00:42:35.260 align:middle line:90%
>>DUNWOODY: It's amazing.

00:42:35.260 --> 00:42:36.550 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Absolutely amazing.

00:42:36.550 --> 00:42:39.020 align:middle line:84%
Emma, thank you so much for
explaining all this today.

00:42:39.020 --> 00:42:40.130 align:middle line:90%
I really appreciate it.

00:42:40.130 --> 00:42:42.203 align:middle line:84%
I think it's very useful
for a lot of people.

00:42:42.203 --> 00:42:43.120 align:middle line:90%

They're pretty wild.
