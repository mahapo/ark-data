>>REGINA MEREDITH: Imagine if we
had as much control of our fate

00:00:30.450 --> 00:00:33.510 align:middle line:10%
and our dreams as we
have in our daily lives.

00:00:33.510 --> 00:00:35.180 align:middle line:84%
Adepts throughout
history have always

00:00:35.180 --> 00:00:38.450 align:middle line:84%
been able to use dream time as
their playground of experience,

00:00:38.450 --> 00:00:41.990 align:middle line:84%
practice, and learning through
the state of lucid dreaming.

00:00:41.990 --> 00:00:43.550 align:middle line:84%
How would your
night world change

00:00:43.550 --> 00:00:46.850 align:middle line:84%
if you had choices on how
your dreams played out?

00:00:46.850 --> 00:00:49.490 align:middle line:84%
Jared Zeizel, lucid
dreamer, and co-author

00:00:49.490 --> 00:00:52.040 align:middle line:84%
of "The Field Guide to Lucid
Dreaming," is with us today.

00:00:52.040 --> 00:00:54.850 align:middle line:84%
And I have to say,
I love your book.

00:00:54.850 --> 00:00:57.660 align:middle line:84%
I love the illustrations,
the practicality,

00:00:57.660 --> 00:00:58.550 align:middle line:90%
the down-to-earth.

00:00:58.550 --> 00:01:00.570 align:middle line:84%
It is a fabulous
guide to dreaming.

00:01:00.570 --> 00:01:01.820 align:middle line:90%
>>JARED ZEIZEL: Oh, thank you.

00:01:01.820 --> 00:01:02.650 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: I just love it.

00:01:02.650 --> 00:01:04.650 align:middle line:84%
And I thought first of
all, we'd start out-- you

00:01:04.650 --> 00:01:05.930 align:middle line:90%
have a term in here.

00:01:05.930 --> 00:01:07.580 align:middle line:90%
And it's onironauts?

00:01:07.580 --> 00:01:10.280 align:middle line:84%
>>ZEIZEL: Well, what it
means is dream explorer.

00:01:10.280 --> 00:01:14.610 align:middle line:84%
So you know, you have astronaut,
you know, explorer of space.

00:01:14.610 --> 00:01:19.590 align:middle line:84%
Oneiro, meaning dream, is
sort of a dream explorer,

00:01:19.590 --> 00:01:21.470 align:middle line:90%
or explorer of dreams.

00:01:21.470 --> 00:01:24.470 align:middle line:84%
And so that's oneironaut,
or oneironaut, however

00:01:24.470 --> 00:01:26.330 align:middle line:84%
it's pronounced, it's
basically something

00:01:26.330 --> 00:01:28.160 align:middle line:84%
lucid dreamers
can identify with,

00:01:28.160 --> 00:01:31.500 align:middle line:84%
as they are essentially
explorers of their dreams.

00:01:31.500 --> 00:01:33.500 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: I think we've
all had this experience.

00:01:33.500 --> 00:01:35.167 align:middle line:84%
And you talk about
it early in the book,

00:01:35.167 --> 00:01:37.490 align:middle line:90%
it comes up where we wake up.

00:01:37.490 --> 00:01:40.250 align:middle line:84%
And many people feel like
they cheated themselves.

00:01:40.250 --> 00:01:42.355 align:middle line:84%
After you've been gone
exploring all night long,

00:01:42.355 --> 00:01:44.480 align:middle line:84%
and you wake up, and it's,
oh, I won't forget that.

00:01:44.480 --> 00:01:45.590 align:middle line:90%
That was so interesting.

00:01:45.590 --> 00:01:48.920 align:middle line:84%
And poof, your mind
engages upon awakening.

00:01:48.920 --> 00:01:50.930 align:middle line:90%
You change your body position.

00:01:50.930 --> 00:01:52.620 align:middle line:90%
It's all gone.

00:01:52.620 --> 00:01:55.010 align:middle line:84%
>>ZEIZEL: There's
some loose statistics

00:01:55.010 --> 00:01:59.480 align:middle line:84%
that after 5 minutes of
being awake, 50% of the dream

00:01:59.480 --> 00:02:00.770 align:middle line:90%
will be gone.

00:02:00.770 --> 00:02:03.110 align:middle line:90%
After 10 minutes, 90%.

00:02:03.110 --> 00:02:05.420 align:middle line:84%
So we often say, write
down your dreams.

00:02:05.420 --> 00:02:08.539 align:middle line:84%
Because the act of writing it
down reinforces the memory.

00:02:08.539 --> 00:02:11.855 align:middle line:84%
It also gives you this excellent
journal of your exploration

00:02:11.855 --> 00:02:12.730 align:middle line:90%
into the dream world.

00:02:12.730 --> 00:02:13.160 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Well, and
this is saying--

00:02:13.160 --> 00:02:14.750 align:middle line:84%
I mean, there are
certain philosophies

00:02:14.750 --> 00:02:18.223 align:middle line:84%
that say that's the real world,
and this is the illusory world.

00:02:18.223 --> 00:02:19.140 align:middle line:90%
>>ZEIZEL: That's true.

00:02:19.140 --> 00:02:21.200 align:middle line:90%
And I like to think, like--

00:02:21.200 --> 00:02:23.252 align:middle line:84%
take, for example, you
go into the dream world

00:02:23.252 --> 00:02:24.710 align:middle line:84%
and you have this
phenomenal dream.

00:02:24.710 --> 00:02:26.160 align:middle line:90%
And you remember it, too.

00:02:26.160 --> 00:02:27.590 align:middle line:90%
And you're flying.

00:02:27.590 --> 00:02:30.260 align:middle line:84%
You're doing all these things
that you can't physically

00:02:30.260 --> 00:02:32.040 align:middle line:90%
do in this world.

00:02:32.040 --> 00:02:34.610 align:middle line:84%
And some might say, like, well,
isn't that world much better?

00:02:34.610 --> 00:02:36.027 align:middle line:84%
Shouldn't this be,
like, the world

00:02:36.027 --> 00:02:38.120 align:middle line:84%
we kind of reside
to at one point

00:02:38.120 --> 00:02:40.830 align:middle line:84%
and then our real
life is in that world?

00:02:40.830 --> 00:02:43.370 align:middle line:84%
And I like to think that
they're both worlds that

00:02:43.370 --> 00:02:44.570 align:middle line:90%
are equally important.

00:02:44.570 --> 00:02:47.400 align:middle line:90%
And they influence one another.

00:02:47.400 --> 00:02:50.190 align:middle line:84%
So for example,
like, you might--

00:02:50.190 --> 00:02:52.520 align:middle line:84%
let's say-- I guess,
a very simple example

00:02:52.520 --> 00:02:54.560 align:middle line:84%
is, like, you watch
a scary movie.

00:02:54.560 --> 00:02:59.750 align:middle line:84%
And then, the monster from that
movie ends up in your dream.

00:02:59.750 --> 00:03:01.520 align:middle line:84%
So that's, like,
the waking world

00:03:01.520 --> 00:03:04.030 align:middle line:90%
affecting the dream world.

00:03:04.030 --> 00:03:07.040 align:middle line:84%
And we were talking a moment ago
about having a phenomenal dream

00:03:07.040 --> 00:03:09.440 align:middle line:84%
and feeling all
happy and uplifting.

00:03:09.440 --> 00:03:13.190 align:middle line:84%
That emotion translating
into this world

00:03:13.190 --> 00:03:15.710 align:middle line:90%
is a connection between the two.

00:03:15.710 --> 00:03:16.510 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:03:16.510 --> 00:03:18.410 align:middle line:84%
And the emotion can
sometimes guide you

00:03:18.410 --> 00:03:21.310 align:middle line:90%
back, but not necessarily.

00:03:21.310 --> 00:03:22.110 align:middle line:90%
>>ZEIZEL: True.

00:03:22.110 --> 00:03:24.710 align:middle line:84%
The emotion, it acts
as like a thread

00:03:24.710 --> 00:03:26.540 align:middle line:90%
or a trail of breadcrumbs.

00:03:26.540 --> 00:03:29.420 align:middle line:84%
And so a lot of times,
people will say,

00:03:29.420 --> 00:03:30.590 align:middle line:90%
like, how do I lucid dream?

00:03:30.590 --> 00:03:32.548 align:middle line:84%
And I'll always start,
like, start writing down

00:03:32.548 --> 00:03:33.740 align:middle line:90%
the dreams you're having.

00:03:33.740 --> 00:03:35.060 align:middle line:84%
And they go, oh, I don't
remember the dreams.

00:03:35.060 --> 00:03:37.640 align:middle line:84%
And I was like, OK, well,
write whatever you do remember.

00:03:37.640 --> 00:03:39.500 align:middle line:84%
I was like, was
there the color red?

00:03:39.500 --> 00:03:42.408 align:middle line:84%
Was there-- was it a
dream with your dad?

00:03:42.408 --> 00:03:44.450 align:middle line:84%
And they're like, oh, I
don't even remember that.

00:03:44.450 --> 00:03:47.530 align:middle line:84%
But what they do have,
often, is an emotion.

00:03:47.530 --> 00:03:49.740 align:middle line:84%
And that's a great
place to start.

00:03:49.740 --> 00:03:54.008 align:middle line:84%
And so it could just be you
wake up, you're feeling happy.

00:03:54.008 --> 00:03:55.550 align:middle line:84%
Or sometimes, you're
feeling anxious.

00:03:55.550 --> 00:03:56.497 align:middle line:90%
Just write that down.

00:03:56.497 --> 00:03:57.830 align:middle line:90%
And sometimes, that might be it.

00:03:57.830 --> 00:04:02.000 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: OK, so getting into
some of the nuts and bolts,

00:04:02.000 --> 00:04:06.020 align:middle line:84%
because this is a
step-by-step book with a lot

00:04:06.020 --> 00:04:07.980 align:middle line:90%
of wonderful anecdotes in it.

00:04:07.980 --> 00:04:10.370 align:middle line:84%
And one of the things
is first of all,

00:04:10.370 --> 00:04:13.080 align:middle line:84%
you have to be aware
that you're dreaming.

00:04:13.080 --> 00:04:15.230 align:middle line:90%
So we go into, what?

00:04:15.230 --> 00:04:18.565 align:middle line:10%
Three to five REM cycles a
night-- deep sleep cycles

00:04:18.565 --> 00:04:19.440 align:middle line:10%
where we're dreaming.

00:04:19.440 --> 00:04:22.610 align:middle line:84%
So if anyone says,
oh, I never dream, no.

00:04:22.610 --> 00:04:24.160 align:middle line:90%
No, you just don't remember.

00:04:24.160 --> 00:04:24.960 align:middle line:90%
We're all dreaming.

00:04:24.960 --> 00:04:26.370 align:middle line:84%
We're all dreaming,
all the time.

00:04:26.370 --> 00:04:28.832 align:middle line:84%
So you go into these
various states.

00:04:28.832 --> 00:04:30.290 align:middle line:84%
And depending on
when you wake up--

00:04:30.290 --> 00:04:33.350 align:middle line:84%
after the first or the
last cycle, and so forth--

00:04:33.350 --> 00:04:35.780 align:middle line:84%
you encourage people, of
course, to have a dream journal

00:04:35.780 --> 00:04:38.330 align:middle line:84%
and write the dreams down,
as we talked about earlier.

00:04:38.330 --> 00:04:43.490 align:middle line:84%
But the first thing is, one has
to realize they're dreaming.

00:04:43.490 --> 00:04:46.370 align:middle line:84%
And let's talk about a couple of
the techniques you give people.

00:04:46.370 --> 00:04:48.890 align:middle line:84%
Because you have some
homework in your waking hours,

00:04:48.890 --> 00:04:50.720 align:middle line:90%
in order to get to this place.

00:04:50.720 --> 00:04:51.680 align:middle line:90%
>>ZEIZEL: It does.

00:04:51.680 --> 00:04:55.940 align:middle line:84%
And I think, like you said,
finding that awareness--

00:04:55.940 --> 00:04:59.420 align:middle line:84%
and it is a bit of a
tricky, tricky game,

00:04:59.420 --> 00:05:03.140 align:middle line:84%
especially if you've
never had a lucid dream.

00:05:03.140 --> 00:05:06.020 align:middle line:84%
And you're trying to essentially
become aware of something

00:05:06.020 --> 00:05:07.820 align:middle line:84%
where you're not
actually currently

00:05:07.820 --> 00:05:10.400 align:middle line:90%
aware while you're in it.

00:05:10.400 --> 00:05:12.650 align:middle line:84%
So all the techniques
really stem

00:05:12.650 --> 00:05:15.950 align:middle line:84%
from kind of
manipulating our mind,

00:05:15.950 --> 00:05:20.720 align:middle line:84%
or focusing our mind
to detect the dream

00:05:20.720 --> 00:05:25.670 align:middle line:84%
state without us being
consciously aware of it yet.

00:05:25.670 --> 00:05:28.240 align:middle line:84%
And as soon as we can detect
it, well then, it's like--

00:05:28.240 --> 00:05:30.683 align:middle line:84%
you're instantly like, now
you're in a lucid dream.

00:05:30.683 --> 00:05:32.350 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So give
some of the techniques

00:05:32.350 --> 00:05:33.725 align:middle line:84%
that you would do
during the day,

00:05:33.725 --> 00:05:36.332 align:middle line:84%
for example, once you've
committed to finding out

00:05:36.332 --> 00:05:38.290 align:middle line:84%
that you're in the dream
state, and the process

00:05:38.290 --> 00:05:39.530 align:middle line:90%
of lucid dreaming.

00:05:39.530 --> 00:05:42.200 align:middle line:84%
>>ZEIZEL: So one of
the great techniques--

00:05:42.200 --> 00:05:45.250 align:middle line:84%
and it's a bit of homework,
but it's not going to, like,

00:05:45.250 --> 00:05:47.590 align:middle line:84%
eat into your day-- is
just, a couple of times

00:05:47.590 --> 00:05:53.080 align:middle line:84%
throughout the day, asking
yourself, am I dreaming?

00:05:53.080 --> 00:05:54.700 align:middle line:84%
And just saying,
like, am I dreaming?

00:05:54.700 --> 00:05:58.840 align:middle line:84%
Oh, no, I'm not dreaming because
I'm driving to work right now.

00:05:58.840 --> 00:06:00.280 align:middle line:90%
But saying, am I dreaming?

00:06:00.280 --> 00:06:03.220 align:middle line:84%
And taking a brief moment
to actually think about it.

00:06:03.220 --> 00:06:05.080 align:middle line:90%
Like, wait a second.

00:06:05.080 --> 00:06:08.470 align:middle line:84%
Like, is there any
weird moments going on?

00:06:08.470 --> 00:06:11.500 align:middle line:84%
Is there a pink elephant
walking across the street?

00:06:11.500 --> 00:06:14.260 align:middle line:84%
Like, that might be a sign that
you're either at the surface,

00:06:14.260 --> 00:06:16.690 align:middle line:90%
or that you're dreaming.

00:06:16.690 --> 00:06:21.370 align:middle line:84%
But saying that-- and you can
do it during certain moments.

00:06:21.370 --> 00:06:24.580 align:middle line:84%
Like, every time you walk
through your front door,

00:06:24.580 --> 00:06:26.670 align:middle line:90%
ask the question, am I dreaming?

00:06:26.670 --> 00:06:29.580 align:middle line:84%
Or, every time you get in
your car, am I dreaming?

00:06:29.580 --> 00:06:32.080 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: You're starting to
set the pattern of the question

00:06:32.080 --> 00:06:34.160 align:middle line:84%
so that it can translate
into dream time.

00:06:34.160 --> 00:06:35.020 align:middle line:90%
>>ZEIZEL: Exactly.

00:06:35.020 --> 00:06:37.900 align:middle line:84%
And then all this
leads up to, a moment

00:06:37.900 --> 00:06:42.160 align:middle line:84%
where you're in the dream,
and your body and your mind

00:06:42.160 --> 00:06:44.950 align:middle line:84%
that has become accustomed
to asking that question,

00:06:44.950 --> 00:06:46.780 align:middle line:84%
asks the question,
am I dreaming?

00:06:46.780 --> 00:06:49.280 align:middle line:84%
And in the dream, you at
first, would be like, oh, no.

00:06:49.280 --> 00:06:50.080 align:middle line:90%
I'm not dreaming.

00:06:50.080 --> 00:06:50.880 align:middle line:90%
And then go, wait.

00:06:50.880 --> 00:06:51.940 align:middle line:90%
Wait a second.

00:06:51.940 --> 00:06:55.120 align:middle line:90%
I just flew to this party.

00:06:55.120 --> 00:06:56.390 align:middle line:90%
I'm in a dream.

00:06:56.390 --> 00:06:59.260 align:middle line:84%
And that's, like,
the moment where

00:06:59.260 --> 00:07:02.560 align:middle line:84%
you've switched from not being
lucid, to becoming lucid.

00:07:02.560 --> 00:07:05.020 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Now what about these
little points of validation?

00:07:05.020 --> 00:07:06.250 align:middle line:90%
Like, am I dreaming?

00:07:06.250 --> 00:07:10.090 align:middle line:10%
And for example, someone
might look at their hands.

00:07:10.090 --> 00:07:12.490 align:middle line:84%
And normally, you
would count 10 fingers.

00:07:12.490 --> 00:07:14.470 align:middle line:84%
And you give that-- one
woman gave that example

00:07:14.470 --> 00:07:18.170 align:middle line:84%
as finally, the day came
where went, am I dreaming?

00:07:18.170 --> 00:07:21.020 align:middle line:90%
I have 11 fingers, I'm dreaming.

00:07:21.020 --> 00:07:23.470 align:middle line:10%
So give a couple
of little points,

00:07:23.470 --> 00:07:25.060 align:middle line:10%
ways in which we
can anchor this in.

00:07:25.060 --> 00:07:25.860 align:middle line:90%
>>ZEIZEL: Sure.

00:07:25.860 --> 00:07:30.583 align:middle line:84%
And these little tips
are really because you

00:07:30.583 --> 00:07:32.750 align:middle line:84%
can ask the question-- like,
I can ask the question,

00:07:32.750 --> 00:07:33.820 align:middle line:90%
am I dreaming?

00:07:33.820 --> 00:07:35.980 align:middle line:84%
And I might be like, wait
a second, I am dreaming.

00:07:35.980 --> 00:07:38.470 align:middle line:84%
I'm very, very rarely
on camera, like,

00:07:38.470 --> 00:07:39.850 align:middle line:90%
doing an interview like this.

00:07:39.850 --> 00:07:41.580 align:middle line:90%
So how can I be sure?

00:07:41.580 --> 00:07:44.710 align:middle line:84%
And so we have different things,
like counting your fingers.

00:07:44.710 --> 00:07:46.420 align:middle line:84%
Or, the one I personally
like is trying

00:07:46.420 --> 00:07:50.680 align:middle line:84%
to push my finger through
the palm of my hand.

00:07:50.680 --> 00:07:54.255 align:middle line:84%
And in lucid dreams, the
finger always goes through.

00:07:54.255 --> 00:07:56.380 align:middle line:84%
And in this world, I guess,
I'm doing it right now.

00:07:56.380 --> 00:07:57.338 align:middle line:90%
It's not going through.

00:07:57.338 --> 00:07:59.620 align:middle line:90%
So this must be real.

00:07:59.620 --> 00:08:03.410 align:middle line:10%
But you can do-- you know, you
can do stuff like turning on,

00:08:03.410 --> 00:08:04.420 align:middle line:10%
like, a light switch.

00:08:04.420 --> 00:08:06.730 align:middle line:84%
Sometimes, the wiring
in the dream world

00:08:06.730 --> 00:08:09.040 align:middle line:84%
isn't quite like the
wiring in our world.

00:08:09.040 --> 00:08:15.040 align:middle line:84%
Or, people often do reading of,
like, if there's a book there,

00:08:15.040 --> 00:08:19.120 align:middle line:84%
look at it, read it, see what
it says, and then look away.

00:08:19.120 --> 00:08:20.040 align:middle line:90%
Now go back.

00:08:20.040 --> 00:08:22.280 align:middle line:90%
Does it say the same thing?

00:08:22.280 --> 00:08:23.370 align:middle line:90%
You can also try--

00:08:23.370 --> 00:08:27.987 align:middle line:84%
one other thing I
like is jumping.

00:08:27.987 --> 00:08:29.820 align:middle line:84%
You might have to do
it at the right moment.

00:08:29.820 --> 00:08:31.360 align:middle line:84%
It might not be work
appropriate if you're in, like,

00:08:31.360 --> 00:08:31.870 align:middle line:90%
a board meeting.

00:08:31.870 --> 00:08:32.828 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right, right.

00:08:32.828 --> 00:08:35.380 align:middle line:84%
>>ZEIZEL: But take a
moment and jump up.

00:08:35.380 --> 00:08:37.659 align:middle line:84%
And often, in the dream,
we kind of-- we float down.

00:08:37.659 --> 00:08:38.470 align:middle line:90%
Or there's this--

00:08:38.470 --> 00:08:39.620 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Yes, you
hover or something.

00:08:39.620 --> 00:08:40.420 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

00:08:40.420 --> 00:08:43.179 align:middle line:84%
>>ZEIZEL: Yeah, there's this
almost molasses to the physics

00:08:43.179 --> 00:08:45.220 align:middle line:90%
in the dream world.

00:08:45.220 --> 00:08:47.560 align:middle line:84%
And so all this
stuff is to really

00:08:47.560 --> 00:08:50.720 align:middle line:84%
be evidence to what world
you're in, whether you're

00:08:50.720 --> 00:08:51.820 align:middle line:90%
in the waking world.

00:08:51.820 --> 00:08:53.500 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Before you can
make the choice of what

00:08:53.500 --> 00:08:55.390 align:middle line:84%
you're going to do, that you
need to know where you are.

00:08:55.390 --> 00:08:56.190 align:middle line:90%
>>ZEIZEL: Exactly.

00:08:56.190 --> 00:08:58.390 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And you know,
along that line, we say,

00:08:58.390 --> 00:09:01.090 align:middle line:84%
oh, pinch yourself to
see if you're in a dream.

00:09:01.090 --> 00:09:05.380 align:middle line:10%
Years ago, for-- oh, gosh, I
think it was over the course

00:09:05.380 --> 00:09:08.747 align:middle line:10%
of at least a dozen years,
maybe more than that--

00:09:08.747 --> 00:09:11.080 align:middle line:10%
I would dream that I was going
to have a baby, because I

00:09:11.080 --> 00:09:13.288 align:middle line:10%
was told when I was young,
you'll never have a child.

00:09:13.288 --> 00:09:14.980 align:middle line:10%
So this became a
subconscious issue.

00:09:14.980 --> 00:09:17.950 align:middle line:10%
So I dreamed that I was
pregnant and I was going

00:09:17.950 --> 00:09:20.260 align:middle line:10%
to have a son, a baby boy.

00:09:20.260 --> 00:09:23.170 align:middle line:10%
And so, in the dream, I'd been
through this so many times,

00:09:23.170 --> 00:09:26.170 align:middle line:10%
I would pinch myself
and say, oh, it hurt.

00:09:26.170 --> 00:09:28.150 align:middle line:90%
I'm not dreaming this time.

00:09:28.150 --> 00:09:30.310 align:middle line:84%
And then, as years
went on, I would

00:09:30.310 --> 00:09:34.972 align:middle line:84%
go through that process even
three times, and then say, no.

00:09:34.972 --> 00:09:36.430 align:middle line:84%
It's not a dream,
and then it would

00:09:36.430 --> 00:09:38.513 align:middle line:84%
be a dream within a dream,
a dream within a dream.

00:09:38.513 --> 00:09:41.782 align:middle line:84%
And even after-- no, I've done
this three different layers,

00:09:41.782 --> 00:09:43.990 align:middle line:84%
this is not a dream because
it hurt every time-- then

00:09:43.990 --> 00:09:46.080 align:middle line:90%
I'd wake up.

00:09:46.080 --> 00:09:46.880 align:middle line:10%
>>ZEIZEL: Yeah.

00:09:46.880 --> 00:09:49.030 align:middle line:84%
And part of that is, like,
because sometimes, it

00:09:49.030 --> 00:09:49.830 align:middle line:90%
does work.

00:09:49.830 --> 00:09:52.542 align:middle line:84%
But then, all these techniques
may be safer, the finger

00:09:52.542 --> 00:09:53.500 align:middle line:90%
going through the hand.

00:09:53.500 --> 00:09:54.730 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Exactly.

00:09:54.730 --> 00:09:55.970 align:middle line:90%
>>ZEIZEL: Like, they don't--

00:09:55.970 --> 00:09:57.340 align:middle line:84%
because you could actually
have a dream where your finger

00:09:57.340 --> 00:09:58.630 align:middle line:90%
doesn't go through the hand.

00:09:58.630 --> 00:10:00.700 align:middle line:84%
So we try to give a
couple different options.

00:10:00.700 --> 00:10:03.550 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Yes, better than
just trying to pinch yourself.

00:10:03.550 --> 00:10:04.350 align:middle line:90%
>>ZEIZEL: Mm-hmm.

00:10:04.350 --> 00:10:04.650 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:10:04.650 --> 00:10:05.450 align:middle line:90%
>>ZEIZEL: Yeah.

00:10:05.450 --> 00:10:06.730 align:middle line:90%
And so it's all just--

00:10:06.730 --> 00:10:09.190 align:middle line:84%
you know, because it's
this weird thing that we're

00:10:09.190 --> 00:10:11.050 align:middle line:84%
trying to catch
but we're not aware

00:10:11.050 --> 00:10:12.640 align:middle line:84%
that we're trying
to catch it, we

00:10:12.640 --> 00:10:16.927 align:middle line:84%
have to be flexible and
try different things.

00:10:16.927 --> 00:10:19.510 align:middle line:84%
And this always goes to, like,
one of the key things is, like,

00:10:19.510 --> 00:10:20.980 align:middle line:90%
keep an open mind.

00:10:20.980 --> 00:10:24.190 align:middle line:84%
And just know that if you
want to have a lucid dream,

00:10:24.190 --> 00:10:25.820 align:middle line:84%
you will eventually
have a lucid dream.

00:10:25.820 --> 00:10:29.950 align:middle line:84%
Because everyone who dreams has
the ability to become lucid.

00:10:29.950 --> 00:10:34.930 align:middle line:84%
And starting with that as a
foundation is a great thing.

00:10:34.930 --> 00:10:36.680 align:middle line:84%
And sometimes, people,
they just-- knowing

00:10:36.680 --> 00:10:39.710 align:middle line:84%
that they can have a lucid
dream, that very night,

00:10:39.710 --> 00:10:42.200 align:middle line:84%
they'll get a little bit of
awareness in their dream.

00:10:42.200 --> 00:10:43.190 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:10:43.190 --> 00:10:46.070 align:middle line:84%
OK, now let's talk about
the various cycles.

00:10:46.070 --> 00:10:48.900 align:middle line:84%
Because there are some people
who have impeded sleep.

00:10:48.900 --> 00:10:50.580 align:middle line:84%
We'll talk about
that in a moment.

00:10:50.580 --> 00:10:53.330 align:middle line:84%
So we have these,
say, average four

00:10:53.330 --> 00:10:54.950 align:middle line:84%
or five different
cycles a night,

00:10:54.950 --> 00:10:58.160 align:middle line:84%
where we go in and out
of deep dream state.

00:10:58.160 --> 00:11:02.330 align:middle line:84%
Is there a given cycle
or particular cycle

00:11:02.330 --> 00:11:05.870 align:middle line:84%
that's more advantageous
to interface

00:11:05.870 --> 00:11:08.780 align:middle line:90%
with on a lucid basis for us?

00:11:08.780 --> 00:11:09.760 align:middle line:90%
>>ZEIZEL: Definitely.

00:11:09.760 --> 00:11:11.060 align:middle line:90%
What we're trying to do--

00:11:11.060 --> 00:11:13.640 align:middle line:84%
you know, when we're trying
to have a lucid dream--

00:11:13.640 --> 00:11:17.420 align:middle line:84%
is we're trying to
catch that REM stage.

00:11:17.420 --> 00:11:22.790 align:middle line:84%
And you know, that's where the
majority of our dreams happen.

00:11:22.790 --> 00:11:25.610 align:middle line:84%
And so the potency of the
dream is at its highest

00:11:25.610 --> 00:11:26.960 align:middle line:90%
in the REM stage.

00:11:26.960 --> 00:11:29.550 align:middle line:84%
These other stages,
we're kind of--

00:11:29.550 --> 00:11:32.750 align:middle line:84%
I almost like to look at it
as like this roller coaster.

00:11:32.750 --> 00:11:33.680 align:middle line:90%
So we start up here.

00:11:33.680 --> 00:11:34.480 align:middle line:90%
We're awake.

00:11:34.480 --> 00:11:36.000 align:middle line:90%
Then we slowly drift down.

00:11:36.000 --> 00:11:39.740 align:middle line:84%
And our body is slowing down
physically-- our heart rate,

00:11:39.740 --> 00:11:41.060 align:middle line:90%
our core temperature.

00:11:41.060 --> 00:11:42.450 align:middle line:90%
Then we hit this deep sleep.

00:11:42.450 --> 00:11:44.763 align:middle line:84%
And in that stage, our
body is fixing itself.

00:11:44.763 --> 00:11:45.930 align:middle line:90%
And then we start coming up.

00:11:45.930 --> 00:11:47.138 align:middle line:90%
And we get higher and higher.

00:11:47.138 --> 00:11:50.510 align:middle line:84%
And then, we're actually
about to wake up,

00:11:50.510 --> 00:11:53.720 align:middle line:84%
but we actually stay just
beneath the surface at REM.

00:11:53.720 --> 00:11:55.800 align:middle line:84%
And that's when
our dreams happen.

00:11:55.800 --> 00:11:59.750 align:middle line:84%
And that's when it's the best
time to have a lucid dream.

00:11:59.750 --> 00:12:01.250 align:middle line:90%
So--

00:12:01.250 --> 00:12:02.930 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: How do
you program that?

00:12:02.930 --> 00:12:04.930 align:middle line:84%
>>ZEIZEL: Well, the good
thing is, we're already

00:12:04.930 --> 00:12:05.930 align:middle line:90%
programmed naturally.

00:12:05.930 --> 00:12:09.980 align:middle line:84%
And I know different
things and external things

00:12:09.980 --> 00:12:12.350 align:middle line:84%
might change if you're
on a certain medication,

00:12:12.350 --> 00:12:13.220 align:middle line:90%
or what you ate.

00:12:13.220 --> 00:12:17.600 align:middle line:84%
But for the base, that's
already programmed in us.

00:12:17.600 --> 00:12:19.670 align:middle line:84%
And part of learning
how to lucid dream

00:12:19.670 --> 00:12:21.860 align:middle line:84%
is understanding what
your programming is.

00:12:21.860 --> 00:12:27.290 align:middle line:84%
So REM usually-- or, I should
say, the largest period of REM

00:12:27.290 --> 00:12:31.490 align:middle line:84%
usually happens about four to
six hours after you initially

00:12:31.490 --> 00:12:32.300 align:middle line:90%
went to sleep.

00:12:32.300 --> 00:12:37.070 align:middle line:84%
You've already gone through
two or three full sleep cycles

00:12:37.070 --> 00:12:38.150 align:middle line:90%
with REM included.

00:12:38.150 --> 00:12:41.370 align:middle line:84%
But the REM period has
been very short in those.

00:12:41.370 --> 00:12:44.218 align:middle line:84%
And when you get to
later in your sleep,

00:12:44.218 --> 00:12:45.260 align:middle line:90%
the REM period is longer.

00:12:45.260 --> 00:12:47.250 align:middle line:84%
So you want to
try to catch that.

00:12:47.250 --> 00:12:51.680 align:middle line:84%
And so what we talk about
is doing a wake back to bed.

00:12:51.680 --> 00:12:54.200 align:middle line:84%
And so what a wake
back to bed is you

00:12:54.200 --> 00:12:56.360 align:middle line:84%
sleep for about
four to six hours.

00:12:56.360 --> 00:12:59.420 align:middle line:84%
And you know, it is
a two hour range.

00:12:59.420 --> 00:13:02.360 align:middle line:84%
But that's because we're
all a little bit different.

00:13:02.360 --> 00:13:05.330 align:middle line:84%
And finding when your
REM clicks in-- and so

00:13:05.330 --> 00:13:09.090 align:middle line:84%
want to wake up right before
that REM starts, but not

00:13:09.090 --> 00:13:09.890 align:middle line:90%
wake up fully.

00:13:09.890 --> 00:13:11.750 align:middle line:84%
You want to keep your body
still at rest so you go back

00:13:11.750 --> 00:13:13.730 align:middle line:84%
to sleep, but you're
starting to wake up

00:13:13.730 --> 00:13:17.670 align:middle line:84%
your mind so that you can
become present in the dream.

00:13:17.670 --> 00:13:19.910 align:middle line:90%
And so you wake up.

00:13:19.910 --> 00:13:24.280 align:middle line:84%
You might be up for about,
oh, 15 to 30 minutes.

00:13:24.280 --> 00:13:26.000 align:middle line:84%
And you should
think about dreaming

00:13:26.000 --> 00:13:28.250 align:middle line:90%
and think about becoming lucid.

00:13:28.250 --> 00:13:30.620 align:middle line:84%
You can even read a
chapter in the book.

00:13:30.620 --> 00:13:32.960 align:middle line:84%
And then you go back to
sleep, keeping in mind, like,

00:13:32.960 --> 00:13:33.170 align:middle line:90%
all right.

00:13:33.170 --> 00:13:34.160 align:middle line:90%
I will become lucid.

00:13:34.160 --> 00:13:35.640 align:middle line:90%
I will become lucid.

00:13:35.640 --> 00:13:36.980 align:middle line:90%
And then you go into REM.

00:13:36.980 --> 00:13:39.650 align:middle line:84%
And the hope is
that those thoughts

00:13:39.650 --> 00:13:41.330 align:middle line:84%
from when you were
awake are still

00:13:41.330 --> 00:13:43.220 align:middle line:90%
at the forefront of your mind.

00:13:43.220 --> 00:13:46.060 align:middle line:84%
And then you ask that
question, am I dreaming?

00:13:46.060 --> 00:13:47.030 align:middle line:90%
And you go, yes.

00:13:47.030 --> 00:13:48.270 align:middle line:90%
I'm dreaming.

00:13:48.270 --> 00:13:49.790 align:middle line:90%
And then you're lucid--

00:13:49.790 --> 00:13:51.598 align:middle line:84%
and now, you're
lucid in your dream.

00:13:51.598 --> 00:13:54.140 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So this is usually in
the wee hours of the morning,

00:13:54.140 --> 00:13:57.080 align:middle line:84%
or even after the last
REM cycle sometimes?

00:13:57.080 --> 00:14:01.190 align:middle line:10%
Which, I mean, I've always
found the last REM cycle

00:14:01.190 --> 00:14:04.230 align:middle line:10%
before waking for the day
is usually where, of course,

00:14:04.230 --> 00:14:05.480 align:middle line:10%
the best memory comes through.

00:14:05.480 --> 00:14:08.500 align:middle line:84%
>>ZEIZEL: So there's a
little bit of trial and error

00:14:08.500 --> 00:14:13.600 align:middle line:84%
when finding kind of what you're
naturally programmed to do.

00:14:13.600 --> 00:14:16.190 align:middle line:84%
But once you find
that spot, then when

00:14:16.190 --> 00:14:19.290 align:middle line:84%
it's time to do a wake back
to bed, you designate an hour.

00:14:19.290 --> 00:14:20.090 align:middle line:90%
It's Friday night.

00:14:20.090 --> 00:14:21.980 align:middle line:84%
I don't have to worry
about work tomorrow.

00:14:21.980 --> 00:14:24.210 align:middle line:84%
I'm going to do awake
back to bed tonight.

00:14:24.210 --> 00:14:25.670 align:middle line:84%
And you're like,
all right, I know

00:14:25.670 --> 00:14:27.560 align:middle line:84%
that the way my
body functions is I

00:14:27.560 --> 00:14:32.550 align:middle line:84%
have the biggest REM cycle
six hours after I go to bed.

00:14:32.550 --> 00:14:34.693 align:middle line:90%
And so you set your alarm.

00:14:34.693 --> 00:14:36.110 align:middle line:84%
You have to estimate
a little bit.

00:14:36.110 --> 00:14:38.443 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Or, can you just
program the subconscious mind

00:14:38.443 --> 00:14:39.655 align:middle line:90%
to wake you up at that time?

00:14:39.655 --> 00:14:40.905 align:middle line:90%
>>ZEIZEL: You know, sometimes.

00:14:40.905 --> 00:14:41.705 align:middle line:90%
And it's funny.

00:14:41.705 --> 00:14:43.985 align:middle line:84%
Whenever I have a big
thing the next day,

00:14:43.985 --> 00:14:45.360 align:middle line:84%
I always wake up
before my alarm.

00:14:45.360 --> 00:14:48.345 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Yeah, I do too,
like a minute before.

00:14:48.345 --> 00:14:49.970 align:middle line:84%
>>ZEIZEL: And actually,
we don't really

00:14:49.970 --> 00:14:52.137 align:middle line:84%
talk about kind of program
in your mind in that way.

00:14:52.137 --> 00:14:53.670 align:middle line:84%
We sort of rely on
the alarm clock.

00:14:53.670 --> 00:14:54.380 align:middle line:90%
But that's a great thing.

00:14:54.380 --> 00:14:56.420 align:middle line:84%
Because the reason you're
waking up is you've

00:14:56.420 --> 00:14:59.270 align:middle line:90%
deemed something very important.

00:14:59.270 --> 00:15:00.540 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: It's set in there.

00:15:00.540 --> 00:15:00.830 align:middle line:90%
>>ZEIZEL: Yeah.

00:15:00.830 --> 00:15:02.150 align:middle line:90%
I got to catch a flight.

00:15:02.150 --> 00:15:03.483 align:middle line:90%
I don't want to miss the flight.

00:15:03.483 --> 00:15:05.630 align:middle line:84%
So you've reinforced
that idea that

00:15:05.630 --> 00:15:09.380 align:middle line:84%
waking up at this particular
time is extremely important.

00:15:09.380 --> 00:15:13.910 align:middle line:84%
And when we can put that same
importance to our dream lives,

00:15:13.910 --> 00:15:17.900 align:middle line:84%
then we become closer
to having a lucid dream,

00:15:17.900 --> 00:15:20.840 align:middle line:84%
or building that relationship
with the dream world.

00:15:20.840 --> 00:15:23.990 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And let's talk
about the ways in which once--

00:15:23.990 --> 00:15:25.330 align:middle line:90%
and all of that's in this book.

00:15:25.330 --> 00:15:26.570 align:middle line:84%
So people can read
the book, and they're

00:15:26.570 --> 00:15:28.195 align:middle line:84%
going to see all the
ways in which they

00:15:28.195 --> 00:15:32.000 align:middle line:84%
can set the intention all the
way through to then utilizing

00:15:32.000 --> 00:15:34.325 align:middle line:90%
well that lucid dream time.

00:15:34.325 --> 00:15:39.160 align:middle line:10%
And one of the ways is to
overcome challenges in life,

00:15:39.160 --> 00:15:39.960 align:middle line:10%
for example.

00:15:39.960 --> 00:15:41.502 align:middle line:84%
A lot of people are
even afraid to go

00:15:41.502 --> 00:15:43.670 align:middle line:90%
to sleep because of nightmares.

00:15:43.670 --> 00:15:46.730 align:middle line:10%
You can actually go in
and you can inquire--

00:15:46.730 --> 00:15:49.760 align:middle line:10%
can you not-- if you are, say,
a person that has nightmares?

00:15:49.760 --> 00:15:50.870 align:middle line:90%
>>ZEIZEL: Oh, definitely.

00:15:50.870 --> 00:15:54.290 align:middle line:84%
And nightmares-- this
is a weird saying,

00:15:54.290 --> 00:15:57.020 align:middle line:84%
but nightmares hold a
special place in my heart.

00:15:57.020 --> 00:16:03.860 align:middle line:84%
Because they are so potent with
who we are, what our fears are.

00:16:03.860 --> 00:16:06.950 align:middle line:84%
And I find them one
of the easiest ways

00:16:06.950 --> 00:16:10.280 align:middle line:90%
to get-- to become lucid.

00:16:10.280 --> 00:16:13.300 align:middle line:84%
So some might think,
well, what is a nightmare?

00:16:13.300 --> 00:16:15.140 align:middle line:84%
A nightmare can be just
from a scary movie,

00:16:15.140 --> 00:16:16.550 align:middle line:90%
and then the next day it's gone.

00:16:16.550 --> 00:16:18.900 align:middle line:84%
Or it can be, like, a
deep-seated anxiety.

00:16:18.900 --> 00:16:20.317 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: It could
be reoccurring.

00:16:20.317 --> 00:16:22.070 align:middle line:84%
>>ZEIZEL: It could
be reoccurring.

00:16:22.070 --> 00:16:29.810 align:middle line:84%
It could be even stemming
from PTSD or depression.

00:16:29.810 --> 00:16:31.700 align:middle line:90%
Nightmares are very common.

00:16:31.700 --> 00:16:34.490 align:middle line:84%
And a nightmare
is something that

00:16:34.490 --> 00:16:36.660 align:middle line:90%
is not an enjoyable experience.

00:16:36.660 --> 00:16:41.900 align:middle line:84%
And it is completely reasonable
to be afraid of a nightmare.

00:16:41.900 --> 00:16:44.300 align:middle line:84%
Like, I had plenty of
nightmares when I was a kid.

00:16:44.300 --> 00:16:45.920 align:middle line:84%
And it's like, I
don't want to dream,

00:16:45.920 --> 00:16:50.420 align:middle line:84%
or I want to sleep because I
don't want to deal with that.

00:16:50.420 --> 00:16:52.310 align:middle line:84%
But for a lot of
nightmares, especially

00:16:52.310 --> 00:16:57.380 align:middle line:84%
the really potent ones that
come from deep-seated anxiety

00:16:57.380 --> 00:17:01.420 align:middle line:84%
or something in us,
they're not going

00:17:01.420 --> 00:17:02.891 align:middle line:90%
to go away just willy-nilly.

00:17:02.891 --> 00:17:04.849 align:middle line:84%
Because, really, it's
something that you're not

00:17:04.849 --> 00:17:07.250 align:middle line:90%
dealing with internally.

00:17:07.250 --> 00:17:12.440 align:middle line:84%
And so by becoming lucid, you
can then enter the nightmare.

00:17:12.440 --> 00:17:14.420 align:middle line:84%
It does take a little
bit of courage at times.

00:17:14.420 --> 00:17:16.819 align:middle line:84%
Like, you've got to
face down an adversary.

00:17:16.819 --> 00:17:18.680 align:middle line:84%
But you can then
ask the adversary,

00:17:18.680 --> 00:17:21.859 align:middle line:84%
you know, why are
you chasing me?

00:17:21.859 --> 00:17:24.260 align:middle line:84%
Why are you-- you
know, why do you

00:17:24.260 --> 00:17:26.089 align:middle line:90%
keep showing up in my dreams?

00:17:26.089 --> 00:17:31.490 align:middle line:84%
And very often, after
confronting the nightmare,

00:17:31.490 --> 00:17:34.370 align:middle line:90%
the nightmare will then leave.

00:17:34.370 --> 00:17:38.600 align:middle line:84%
Or it will kind of lead you
into the next understanding

00:17:38.600 --> 00:17:39.560 align:middle line:90%
of why it's there.

00:17:39.560 --> 00:17:41.180 align:middle line:90%
It might answer you.

00:17:41.180 --> 00:17:45.590 align:middle line:84%
And it could even become more
fearsome if you're ignoring it,

00:17:45.590 --> 00:17:47.403 align:middle line:84%
because it's trying
to get your attention.

00:17:47.403 --> 00:17:49.070 align:middle line:84%
It's desperately
trying to let you know.

00:17:49.070 --> 00:17:51.410 align:middle line:90%
Because it's not a boogey man.

00:17:51.410 --> 00:17:52.470 align:middle line:90%
It's not a monster.

00:17:52.470 --> 00:17:53.538 align:middle line:90%
It's not an axe murderer.

00:17:53.538 --> 00:17:55.080 align:middle line:10%
>>REGINA: It's some
un-healed aspect.

00:17:55.080 --> 00:17:57.590 align:middle line:84%
>>ZEIZEL: Yeah, it's an
un-healed aspect of you.

00:17:57.590 --> 00:18:02.150 align:middle line:84%
And at times, we can scare
ourselves about ourselves.

00:18:02.150 --> 00:18:04.860 align:middle line:90%
But part of-- I feel like--

00:18:04.860 --> 00:18:07.730 align:middle line:84%
understanding the world
and understanding ourselves

00:18:07.730 --> 00:18:12.120 align:middle line:84%
is dealing with the more
unpleasant aspects of it.

00:18:12.120 --> 00:18:14.432 align:middle line:84%
Another thing that
I do personally

00:18:14.432 --> 00:18:16.640 align:middle line:84%
is, like, whenever I have
a nightmare, it's like, oh,

00:18:16.640 --> 00:18:18.510 align:middle line:90%
it's time to become lucid.

00:18:18.510 --> 00:18:21.200 align:middle line:84%
And so I'll have a nightmare
in one form or another.

00:18:21.200 --> 00:18:22.700 align:middle line:84%
And I almost always
wake up from it,

00:18:22.700 --> 00:18:25.820 align:middle line:84%
because I'm usually shocked
awake because I'm so scared.

00:18:25.820 --> 00:18:27.230 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:18:27.230 --> 00:18:30.080 align:middle line:84%
>>ZEIZEL: And I say to
myself, all right, Jared.

00:18:30.080 --> 00:18:32.150 align:middle line:84%
You're about to go
back into the dream.

00:18:32.150 --> 00:18:33.990 align:middle line:90%
Those monsters are still there.

00:18:33.990 --> 00:18:35.790 align:middle line:90%
They're waiting for you.

00:18:35.790 --> 00:18:37.970 align:middle line:90%
They know you're coming back.

00:18:37.970 --> 00:18:39.500 align:middle line:84%
But when you get
there, remember,

00:18:39.500 --> 00:18:42.250 align:middle line:84%
as soon as you see
them, that it's a dream.

00:18:42.250 --> 00:18:44.310 align:middle line:90%
And you'll become lucid.

00:18:44.310 --> 00:18:46.160 align:middle line:90%
And you can deal with them.

00:18:46.160 --> 00:18:48.705 align:middle line:84%
And like, almost--
because sometimes, I've

00:18:48.705 --> 00:18:50.330 align:middle line:84%
set the intention to
have a lucid dream

00:18:50.330 --> 00:18:51.538 align:middle line:90%
and it doesn't always happen.

00:18:51.538 --> 00:18:56.380 align:middle line:84%
But 100% of those moments with
nightmares, I become lucid.

00:18:56.380 --> 00:18:58.640 align:middle line:84%
And I think that's
because nightmares

00:18:58.640 --> 00:19:03.330 align:middle line:84%
are so important in
understanding who we are.

00:19:03.330 --> 00:19:07.100 align:middle line:84%
And the reason they're so
scary is because in a way,

00:19:07.100 --> 00:19:10.490 align:middle line:84%
the nightmare knows
that it has to be known.

00:19:10.490 --> 00:19:12.060 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:19:12.060 --> 00:19:15.200 align:middle line:84%
>>ZEIZEL: And so this
isn't to say that if you're

00:19:15.200 --> 00:19:18.080 align:middle line:84%
having terrible
nightmares, like, tonight

00:19:18.080 --> 00:19:21.340 align:middle line:84%
is the night you have to go back
in and face it and overcome it.

00:19:21.340 --> 00:19:22.820 align:middle line:90%
No, these things take time.

00:19:22.820 --> 00:19:27.560 align:middle line:84%
And each person is different in
how they deal with their fears

00:19:27.560 --> 00:19:30.530 align:middle line:90%
and what's bothering them.

00:19:30.530 --> 00:19:34.040 align:middle line:84%
But by trying to
become lucid, you're

00:19:34.040 --> 00:19:37.820 align:middle line:84%
actively taking a step
to deal with perhaps

00:19:37.820 --> 00:19:41.180 align:middle line:84%
an unresolved conflict
or something that

00:19:41.180 --> 00:19:43.220 align:middle line:84%
has been bothering you
in your daily life.

00:19:43.220 --> 00:19:43.640 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Well,
that's why think it's

00:19:43.640 --> 00:19:44.840 align:middle line:84%
so-- that's why I
wanted to bring up

00:19:44.840 --> 00:19:45.980 align:middle line:90%
the subject of nightmares.

00:19:45.980 --> 00:19:48.050 align:middle line:84%
Because it seems
to me, that's maybe

00:19:48.050 --> 00:19:51.740 align:middle line:84%
the most practical
use of lucid dreaming,

00:19:51.740 --> 00:19:53.698 align:middle line:90%
is to get in and clear stuff up.

00:19:53.698 --> 00:19:54.740 align:middle line:90%
>>ZEIZEL: Oh, definitely.

00:19:54.740 --> 00:19:57.435 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: I mean,
yeah, to fly and to do

00:19:57.435 --> 00:19:59.060 align:middle line:84%
all of these other
things are just fun.

00:19:59.060 --> 00:20:00.260 align:middle line:90%
I mean, It feels good.

00:20:00.260 --> 00:20:02.270 align:middle line:84%
The sensations are
great and all that.

00:20:02.270 --> 00:20:04.580 align:middle line:84%
But to go in and
clear our fears--

00:20:04.580 --> 00:20:08.690 align:middle line:84%
and also, use it for healing,
healing physical, or mental,

00:20:08.690 --> 00:20:10.070 align:middle line:90%
or emotional ailments.

00:20:10.070 --> 00:20:12.200 align:middle line:84%
We can use lucid
dreaming to do that.

00:20:12.200 --> 00:20:15.500 align:middle line:84%
Let's talk about the
notion of having, say,

00:20:15.500 --> 00:20:18.140 align:middle line:84%
whether it's a person,
a sage, an animal,

00:20:18.140 --> 00:20:22.815 align:middle line:84%
as a partner that we use
in dream time for healing.

00:20:22.815 --> 00:20:23.690 align:middle line:90%
>>ZEIZEL: Definitely.

00:20:23.690 --> 00:20:25.760 align:middle line:84%
And I think, like,
everything you just said

00:20:25.760 --> 00:20:28.840 align:middle line:90%
is really important--

00:20:28.840 --> 00:20:32.680 align:middle line:84%
and having sort of
a sage or an animal,

00:20:32.680 --> 00:20:37.590 align:middle line:84%
or you know, what we refer to
in the book as a spirit guide.

00:20:37.590 --> 00:20:40.370 align:middle line:84%
And sometimes, people get
turned off by the word spirit.

00:20:40.370 --> 00:20:41.670 align:middle line:90%
So just look at it as a mentor.

00:20:41.670 --> 00:20:43.295 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Our audience
is good with it.

00:20:43.295 --> 00:20:44.630 align:middle line:90%
>>ZEIZEL: OK, all right.

00:20:44.630 --> 00:20:45.830 align:middle line:90%
So a spirit guide.

00:20:45.830 --> 00:20:51.050 align:middle line:10%
And they're there
to help you navigate

00:20:51.050 --> 00:20:53.840 align:middle line:10%
this dream world, which is
sometimes very confusing,

00:20:53.840 --> 00:20:55.820 align:middle line:10%
can be full of fears.

00:20:55.820 --> 00:20:58.550 align:middle line:84%
Or sometimes, it's
just pure strangeness.

00:20:58.550 --> 00:21:01.820 align:middle line:84%
And you need help
grasping at it.

00:21:01.820 --> 00:21:04.970 align:middle line:90%
And sometimes, I wonder, is my--

00:21:04.970 --> 00:21:07.400 align:middle line:84%
and my spirit
guides go through--

00:21:07.400 --> 00:21:08.470 align:middle line:90%
they change.

00:21:08.470 --> 00:21:11.270 align:middle line:84%
At one point, it was
like an old woman.

00:21:11.270 --> 00:21:13.160 align:middle line:84%
When I was younger,
it was a tiger.

00:21:13.160 --> 00:21:18.020 align:middle line:84%
Now it's this big, giant
grayish-purple bear.

00:21:18.020 --> 00:21:21.320 align:middle line:84%
So I wonder, is this a product
of something inside me?

00:21:21.320 --> 00:21:27.517 align:middle line:84%
Or is this an external
component that is--

00:21:27.517 --> 00:21:28.850 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: --there to assist you?

00:21:28.850 --> 00:21:30.760 align:middle line:90%
>>ZEIZEL: Exactly.

00:21:30.760 --> 00:21:33.520 align:middle line:84%
And so this leans
into people sometimes

00:21:33.520 --> 00:21:34.520 align:middle line:90%
go into the dream world.

00:21:34.520 --> 00:21:37.880 align:middle line:84%
And they disrespect
the dream characters.

00:21:37.880 --> 00:21:39.710 align:middle line:84%
Sometimes there's
no consequences.

00:21:39.710 --> 00:21:43.460 align:middle line:84%
But why do-- well, why
even take that time

00:21:43.460 --> 00:21:46.100 align:middle line:84%
to disrespect them
or hurt them, when

00:21:46.100 --> 00:21:48.530 align:middle line:84%
they could possibly
show something to you,

00:21:48.530 --> 00:21:50.870 align:middle line:90%
or they happened to just be you?

00:21:50.870 --> 00:21:52.720 align:middle line:84%
Or, in this case,
with a spirit guide,

00:21:52.720 --> 00:21:55.490 align:middle line:84%
it's someone who's there to
actually guide you and bring

00:21:55.490 --> 00:22:00.570 align:middle line:84%
you to a further degree of
development in your life--

00:22:00.570 --> 00:22:03.830 align:middle line:84%
both in your waking life,
and your dream life.

00:22:03.830 --> 00:22:04.910 align:middle line:10%
>>REGINA: Absolutely.

00:22:04.910 --> 00:22:08.450 align:middle line:10%
And then there are the
times where we have--

00:22:08.450 --> 00:22:11.000 align:middle line:10%
I've had different series
of repetitious dreams.

00:22:11.000 --> 00:22:16.460 align:middle line:84%
But one of them was a
self-mastery kind of dream that

00:22:16.460 --> 00:22:21.290 align:middle line:84%
started when I was 3, and had no
control over the situation of--

00:22:21.290 --> 00:22:22.200 align:middle line:90%
they were car dreams.

00:22:22.200 --> 00:22:24.260 align:middle line:84%
So cars careening down
the hill, and I realized

00:22:24.260 --> 00:22:25.880 align:middle line:90%
no parents are in the car.

00:22:25.880 --> 00:22:27.710 align:middle line:84%
And it's going to
go into the ocean.

00:22:27.710 --> 00:22:29.000 align:middle line:84%
So of course, you wake
up because there's

00:22:29.000 --> 00:22:29.800 align:middle line:90%
nothing you can do.

00:22:29.800 --> 00:22:32.168 align:middle line:84%
As time goes on, you get
your driver's license.

00:22:32.168 --> 00:22:34.460 align:middle line:84%
And then, as the dreams
progressed through the decades,

00:22:34.460 --> 00:22:37.520 align:middle line:84%
finally, the time came
where I was in a situation

00:22:37.520 --> 00:22:41.075 align:middle line:84%
and completely overcame
the effects of gravity.

00:22:41.075 --> 00:22:42.950 align:middle line:84%
And so I was in a
different world of physics.

00:22:42.950 --> 00:22:44.840 align:middle line:84%
And it was because I
had seen someone do it,

00:22:44.840 --> 00:22:49.110 align:middle line:84%
so I knew that I could do
this feat in this automobile.

00:22:49.110 --> 00:22:51.520 align:middle line:84%
And the dreams
stopped at that time.

00:22:51.520 --> 00:22:55.160 align:middle line:84%
They weren't lucid dreams,
they were recurring dreams.

00:22:55.160 --> 00:22:57.710 align:middle line:84%
But I was aware of the
progress through the years

00:22:57.710 --> 00:23:00.990 align:middle line:84%
to where, then, the need for
the dreams simply disappear.

00:23:00.990 --> 00:23:04.160 align:middle line:10%
And I think a lot of people have
these, where that sequence is

00:23:04.160 --> 00:23:07.130 align:middle line:10%
gone for a lifetime because
the mastery was done

00:23:07.130 --> 00:23:09.110 align:middle line:10%
by overcoming a certain fear.

00:23:09.110 --> 00:23:10.460 align:middle line:90%
>>ZEIZEL: Oh, yeah.

00:23:10.460 --> 00:23:13.940 align:middle line:84%
And I know from everything--
like you say, fears,

00:23:13.940 --> 00:23:19.250 align:middle line:84%
to creativity, to
just problem solving,

00:23:19.250 --> 00:23:22.370 align:middle line:84%
I can speak to the filmmaking
portion of my life.

00:23:22.370 --> 00:23:25.640 align:middle line:84%
And films, as we know, are
very expensive to make.

00:23:25.640 --> 00:23:28.210 align:middle line:84%
And you don't always
know, is this idea going

00:23:28.210 --> 00:23:30.470 align:middle line:90%
to look good or not, or work.

00:23:30.470 --> 00:23:33.380 align:middle line:84%
But by becoming lucid,
you can set it up.

00:23:33.380 --> 00:23:37.330 align:middle line:84%
You can set up the stage
and bring in the players,

00:23:37.330 --> 00:23:41.570 align:middle line:84%
and see, how does this
story that I've come up with

00:23:41.570 --> 00:23:42.370 align:middle line:90%
play out?

00:23:42.370 --> 00:23:42.610 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: It's true.

00:23:42.610 --> 00:23:43.985 align:middle line:84%
You could just
bring them all in,

00:23:43.985 --> 00:23:45.920 align:middle line:84%
do your auditions
in dream time first.

00:23:45.920 --> 00:23:46.750 align:middle line:90%
>>ZEIZEL: Exactly.

00:23:46.750 --> 00:23:49.090 align:middle line:84%
And some of them might be
a little bit more practical

00:23:49.090 --> 00:23:49.890 align:middle line:90%
to people.

00:23:49.890 --> 00:23:52.280 align:middle line:84%
Because often, we get
nervous before, say,

00:23:52.280 --> 00:23:54.950 align:middle line:84%
a job interview where we
have to give a presentation.

00:23:54.950 --> 00:23:56.420 align:middle line:84%
We'll give the
job, or do the job

00:23:56.420 --> 00:23:58.880 align:middle line:84%
interview or the presentation
in the dream world--

00:23:58.880 --> 00:24:00.213 align:middle line:90%
a place that is completely safe.

00:24:00.213 --> 00:24:01.088 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Absolutely.

00:24:01.088 --> 00:24:02.660 align:middle line:84%
Really good place
for practicing.

00:24:02.660 --> 00:24:04.130 align:middle line:10%
Now I want to go back to
what I was telling you

00:24:04.130 --> 00:24:06.740 align:middle line:10%
about a moment ago, because
I didn't bring about the most

00:24:06.740 --> 00:24:07.700 align:middle line:10%
important point of it.

00:24:07.700 --> 00:24:09.520 align:middle line:90%
Those were not lucid dreams.

00:24:09.520 --> 00:24:11.330 align:middle line:84%
Those were practice
dreams that I

00:24:11.330 --> 00:24:14.090 align:middle line:90%
happen to have good recall of.

00:24:14.090 --> 00:24:17.210 align:middle line:10%
Now how would, say, a
situation like that--

00:24:17.210 --> 00:24:21.680 align:middle line:10%
a decades long process of
self-mastery, so to speak--

00:24:21.680 --> 00:24:26.660 align:middle line:10%
be enhanced, had I actually
been in a lucid state?

00:24:26.660 --> 00:24:31.280 align:middle line:84%
>>ZEIZEL: It could have played
out in many different ways.

00:24:31.280 --> 00:24:36.500 align:middle line:84%
There is the thought that maybe
the mastery would have happened

00:24:36.500 --> 00:24:39.847 align:middle line:84%
sooner, that there's
probably-- often,

00:24:39.847 --> 00:24:41.930 align:middle line:84%
there's moments when we're
just normally dreaming,

00:24:41.930 --> 00:24:43.610 align:middle line:84%
where we're just
sort of spacing out.

00:24:43.610 --> 00:24:45.350 align:middle line:84%
We're just sort of
bringing stuff in.

00:24:45.350 --> 00:24:47.600 align:middle line:84%
We're not taking
a central action.

00:24:47.600 --> 00:24:50.160 align:middle line:90%


00:24:50.160 --> 00:24:52.420 align:middle line:84%
And what I've found
with, like, lucid dreams,

00:24:52.420 --> 00:24:54.140 align:middle line:84%
is that they really--
they bring you

00:24:54.140 --> 00:24:57.080 align:middle line:84%
to this present moment
in the dream world.

00:24:57.080 --> 00:25:02.150 align:middle line:84%
And so a very simple
example is someone calls.

00:25:02.150 --> 00:25:03.923 align:middle line:84%
I guess, this is
actually from the past

00:25:03.923 --> 00:25:05.340 align:middle line:84%
because we all
have caller ID now.

00:25:05.340 --> 00:25:05.630 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:25:05.630 --> 00:25:07.420 align:middle line:84%
>>ZEIZEL: But I
remember being younger.

00:25:07.420 --> 00:25:09.950 align:middle line:84%
And I my mom's
friend would call.

00:25:09.950 --> 00:25:14.430 align:middle line:84%
And she'd say, oh, have her
call me back at this number.

00:25:14.430 --> 00:25:17.330 align:middle line:84%
And if I didn't take that moment
to, like, write down the number

00:25:17.330 --> 00:25:20.820 align:middle line:84%
or remember that she actually
called, I'd forget it.

00:25:20.820 --> 00:25:21.620 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:25:21.620 --> 00:25:24.800 align:middle line:84%
>>ZEIZEL: Of course, hours and
hours later, we're at dinner,

00:25:24.800 --> 00:25:26.800 align:middle line:90%
and I'm like, oh, Mom.

00:25:26.800 --> 00:25:30.320 align:middle line:90%
You know, your friend called.

00:25:30.320 --> 00:25:32.840 align:middle line:84%
And of course, my mom would be
upset that I waited so long.

00:25:32.840 --> 00:25:34.850 align:middle line:84%
But that's just like a
small example of, like,

00:25:34.850 --> 00:25:39.470 align:middle line:84%
bringing the present moment and
taking that time can strengthen

00:25:39.470 --> 00:25:42.130 align:middle line:84%
whatever we are trying to do--
whether it's just remembering

00:25:42.130 --> 00:25:45.740 align:middle line:84%
a number or master
a certain skill.

00:25:45.740 --> 00:25:47.463 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: And again, when you--

00:25:47.463 --> 00:25:49.130 align:middle line:84%
I just want to go
back to this one point

00:25:49.130 --> 00:25:50.588 align:middle line:84%
you mentioned a
little bit ago too.

00:25:50.588 --> 00:25:53.450 align:middle line:10%
When you're in the dream, the
various players that are around

00:25:53.450 --> 00:25:56.060 align:middle line:10%
you in the dream, maybe
we need to consciously

00:25:56.060 --> 00:25:58.400 align:middle line:10%
make a note to
ourselves that we need

00:25:58.400 --> 00:26:00.740 align:middle line:10%
to start noting who
these people are,

00:26:00.740 --> 00:26:02.390 align:middle line:10%
rather than just
having random people

00:26:02.390 --> 00:26:04.400 align:middle line:10%
who we're bumping
into or passing by--

00:26:04.400 --> 00:26:06.890 align:middle line:10%
or whatnot-- in our dreams,
really start paying attention

00:26:06.890 --> 00:26:08.715 align:middle line:10%
to who is in our dreams?

00:26:08.715 --> 00:26:09.590 align:middle line:90%
>>ZEIZEL: Definitely.

00:26:09.590 --> 00:26:11.840 align:middle line:90%
And, like, we were talking--

00:26:11.840 --> 00:26:14.270 align:middle line:84%
you know, my earlier
years of lucid dreaming,

00:26:14.270 --> 00:26:16.250 align:middle line:84%
it was all flying,
motorcycle races,

00:26:16.250 --> 00:26:18.800 align:middle line:90%
very action-oriented stuff.

00:26:18.800 --> 00:26:23.210 align:middle line:84%
As I've gotten older,
I found far more--

00:26:23.210 --> 00:26:26.450 align:middle line:84%
I guess-- excitement
and interest

00:26:26.450 --> 00:26:29.480 align:middle line:84%
in actually just talking
with the dream characters.

00:26:29.480 --> 00:26:30.850 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Interesting.

00:26:30.850 --> 00:26:33.688 align:middle line:84%
>>ZEIZEL: Because sometimes,
you run into someone,

00:26:33.688 --> 00:26:34.730 align:middle line:90%
they have nothing to say.

00:26:34.730 --> 00:26:36.440 align:middle line:90%
They just sort of--

00:26:36.440 --> 00:26:38.540 align:middle line:90%
it's a wandering entity.

00:26:38.540 --> 00:26:41.960 align:middle line:84%
But more often than not,
they'll tell you something.

00:26:41.960 --> 00:26:44.810 align:middle line:84%
It doesn't always make sense,
but it always means something.

00:26:44.810 --> 00:26:47.180 align:middle line:84%
It's something either
from inside you,

00:26:47.180 --> 00:26:51.470 align:middle line:84%
maybe externally, but something
that's important to you.

00:26:51.470 --> 00:26:55.160 align:middle line:84%
And sometimes, it takes days
or months to actually decipher

00:26:55.160 --> 00:26:57.370 align:middle line:90%
that meaning.

00:26:57.370 --> 00:27:02.900 align:middle line:84%
But it is a worthwhile
conversation

00:27:02.900 --> 00:27:07.180 align:middle line:84%
to have from what we
can learn from it.

00:27:07.180 --> 00:27:08.120 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:27:08.120 --> 00:27:10.730 align:middle line:90%
And you know, the spectrum of--

00:27:10.730 --> 00:27:13.370 align:middle line:84%
I mean, to me, the
interesting spectrum

00:27:13.370 --> 00:27:15.090 align:middle line:84%
of things that can
occur in dream time.

00:27:15.090 --> 00:27:18.860 align:middle line:10%
OK, one of the things that's
more sensational-- as you call,

00:27:18.860 --> 00:27:20.270 align:middle line:10%
kind of the superhero things--

00:27:20.270 --> 00:27:22.460 align:middle line:10%
we've talked about looking
someone in the eye,

00:27:22.460 --> 00:27:24.980 align:middle line:10%
getting your messages, having
your totem animals there

00:27:24.980 --> 00:27:27.590 align:middle line:10%
to help you with something
you need to heal--

00:27:27.590 --> 00:27:28.852 align:middle line:10%
nightmares, and so forth.

00:27:28.852 --> 00:27:31.310 align:middle line:84%
Now let's talk about some of
the fun and fantastical stuff.

00:27:31.310 --> 00:27:33.140 align:middle line:84%
Because I don't know
anyone that doesn't

00:27:33.140 --> 00:27:35.540 align:middle line:90%
enjoy flying in their dreams.

00:27:35.540 --> 00:27:38.390 align:middle line:10%
But you're-- in the book,
you're saying that even if you

00:27:38.390 --> 00:27:42.140 align:middle line:10%
don't have flying dreams, you
can teach yourself to have

00:27:42.140 --> 00:27:43.200 align:middle line:10%
a flying dream.

00:27:43.200 --> 00:27:44.000 align:middle line:90%
>>ZEIZEL: Yeah.

00:27:44.000 --> 00:27:46.890 align:middle line:84%
And this goes-- you're talking
about mastery over stuff?

00:27:46.890 --> 00:27:47.690 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:27:47.690 --> 00:27:49.790 align:middle line:84%
>>ZEIZEL: We go into
the dream world kind

00:27:49.790 --> 00:27:51.040 align:middle line:90%
of like we go into this world.

00:27:51.040 --> 00:27:53.570 align:middle line:84%
You know, some babies,
toddlers, they just

00:27:53.570 --> 00:27:55.587 align:middle line:84%
start learning their
numbers and alphabet sooner

00:27:55.587 --> 00:27:56.420 align:middle line:90%
than the other ones.

00:27:56.420 --> 00:27:59.000 align:middle line:84%
So sometimes, we go into a
dream, and we just take off

00:27:59.000 --> 00:28:00.320 align:middle line:90%
and we can fly.

00:28:00.320 --> 00:28:02.150 align:middle line:84%
But you know, more
often than not,

00:28:02.150 --> 00:28:03.860 align:middle line:84%
these are skills
we have to learn.

00:28:03.860 --> 00:28:05.900 align:middle line:84%
So we might be able
to, say, take off.

00:28:05.900 --> 00:28:07.730 align:middle line:84%
But now we're going
faster and faster.

00:28:07.730 --> 00:28:09.510 align:middle line:84%
And we don't know,
like, how to land.

00:28:09.510 --> 00:28:11.422 align:middle line:84%
Or we don't know,
like, how to turn.

00:28:11.422 --> 00:28:13.880 align:middle line:84%
And so we do, kind of in the
book-- in the later chapters--

00:28:13.880 --> 00:28:20.270 align:middle line:84%
get into some of the skills
and quote, "super powers"

00:28:20.270 --> 00:28:22.820 align:middle line:84%
in the dream world, and
how you can kind of--

00:28:22.820 --> 00:28:25.470 align:middle line:84%
how you can begin to
learn how to do it.

00:28:25.470 --> 00:28:29.900 align:middle line:84%
So flying is
everyone's favorite.

00:28:29.900 --> 00:28:33.440 align:middle line:84%
And often, like, if you
can't fly in the beginning,

00:28:33.440 --> 00:28:38.060 align:middle line:84%
it's because your mind is
accustomed to the physical laws

00:28:38.060 --> 00:28:38.990 align:middle line:90%
of this world.

00:28:38.990 --> 00:28:39.830 align:middle line:90%
We can't fly.

00:28:39.830 --> 00:28:42.960 align:middle line:90%
I wish we could, but we can't.

00:28:42.960 --> 00:28:45.570 align:middle line:84%
And so our mind, like,
almost has this program

00:28:45.570 --> 00:28:46.370 align:middle line:90%
in the dream world.

00:28:46.370 --> 00:28:48.165 align:middle line:84%
It's like, oh,
you're a human being.

00:28:48.165 --> 00:28:49.040 align:middle line:90%
You don't have wings.

00:28:49.040 --> 00:28:50.030 align:middle line:90%
You can't fly.

00:28:50.030 --> 00:28:53.360 align:middle line:10%
So we have to start
to undo that a bit.

00:28:53.360 --> 00:28:55.970 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Maybe thinking
about the intention that I

00:28:55.970 --> 00:28:58.760 align:middle line:84%
want to fly tonight in
my dream, and really

00:28:58.760 --> 00:29:00.230 align:middle line:90%
making that a strong intention.

00:29:00.230 --> 00:29:02.570 align:middle line:10%
And then you give tools
for different ways

00:29:02.570 --> 00:29:04.880 align:middle line:10%
in which you might execute
that once you're lucid

00:29:04.880 --> 00:29:07.140 align:middle line:10%
and you know you're in
this dream time, right?

00:29:07.140 --> 00:29:09.307 align:middle line:84%
>>ZEIZEL: And I'm glad you
brought up the intention.

00:29:09.307 --> 00:29:11.950 align:middle line:84%
Because intent-- everything
starts from an intention.

00:29:11.950 --> 00:29:13.910 align:middle line:84%
Just the intention to
remember your dreams,

00:29:13.910 --> 00:29:16.730 align:middle line:90%
to become lucid, then to fly.

00:29:16.730 --> 00:29:20.658 align:middle line:84%
You want to make that
intention as strong as you can.

00:29:20.658 --> 00:29:22.700 align:middle line:84%
And then from that, like,
you had that intention.

00:29:22.700 --> 00:29:23.360 align:middle line:90%
And it's like, all right.

00:29:23.360 --> 00:29:24.540 align:middle line:90%
In the dream world, I can fly.

00:29:24.540 --> 00:29:26.165 align:middle line:84%
So now you've already
done a little bit

00:29:26.165 --> 00:29:28.520 align:middle line:84%
of that sort of programming
from this world--

00:29:28.520 --> 00:29:30.290 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: --even by
imagining it, yes.

00:29:30.290 --> 00:29:31.100 align:middle line:84%
>>ZEIZEL: And then
you could do, like,

00:29:31.100 --> 00:29:32.720 align:middle line:84%
little-- you know, then,
it's kind of going back

00:29:32.720 --> 00:29:33.930 align:middle line:90%
to the finger thing.

00:29:33.930 --> 00:29:36.340 align:middle line:84%
It's like, little tricks
that-- it's like, all right.

00:29:36.340 --> 00:29:40.260 align:middle line:84%
Well, let me see if I can
find, like, a set of wings

00:29:40.260 --> 00:29:41.060 align:middle line:90%
in the dream world.

00:29:41.060 --> 00:29:43.410 align:middle line:84%
Or let me just see--
not fly, but just

00:29:43.410 --> 00:29:44.990 align:middle line:90%
see how high I can jump.

00:29:44.990 --> 00:29:46.770 align:middle line:84%
And just try and jump
higher and higher.

00:29:46.770 --> 00:29:47.570 align:middle line:90%
And let's see.

00:29:47.570 --> 00:29:49.800 align:middle line:84%
Now let me run and
jump, and see--

00:29:49.800 --> 00:29:52.340 align:middle line:84%
like, kind of coast
a bit in the air.

00:29:52.340 --> 00:29:54.890 align:middle line:84%
And sure enough, you try
out different things.

00:29:54.890 --> 00:29:57.350 align:middle line:90%
And you experiment with it.

00:29:57.350 --> 00:29:59.497 align:middle line:84%
You start to find that
you'll make progress.

00:29:59.497 --> 00:30:00.830 align:middle line:10%
>>REGINA: I've found that over--

00:30:00.830 --> 00:30:02.240 align:middle line:10%
again, none of this is lucid.

00:30:02.240 --> 00:30:03.800 align:middle line:10%
I'm not a lucid dreamer.

00:30:03.800 --> 00:30:05.310 align:middle line:84%
But now, after
reading this book,

00:30:05.310 --> 00:30:08.480 align:middle line:84%
I realize I need to dedicate
myself to doing that just

00:30:08.480 --> 00:30:09.500 align:middle line:90%
to have even more fun.

00:30:09.500 --> 00:30:11.000 align:middle line:84%
Because I already
have great dreams.

00:30:11.000 --> 00:30:12.650 align:middle line:10%
But in the flying
dreams, they started

00:30:12.650 --> 00:30:16.250 align:middle line:10%
as a certain very primitive
type of flapping my wings going

00:30:16.250 --> 00:30:17.195 align:middle line:10%
into the wind, right?

00:30:17.195 --> 00:30:19.820 align:middle line:84%
And then, as the years went on,
of course, you just take a leap

00:30:19.820 --> 00:30:21.110 align:middle line:90%
and you're just soaring.

00:30:21.110 --> 00:30:24.295 align:middle line:84%
But it evolved over
a period of time.

00:30:24.295 --> 00:30:25.170 align:middle line:90%
>>ZEIZEL: Definitely.

00:30:25.170 --> 00:30:26.210 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:30:26.210 --> 00:30:29.450 align:middle line:84%
>>ZEIZEL: And stuff like
even moving beyond flying.

00:30:29.450 --> 00:30:31.540 align:middle line:84%
There's often the idea
of transportation.

00:30:31.540 --> 00:30:32.340 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:30:32.340 --> 00:30:33.800 align:middle line:84%
>>ZEIZEL: I guess flying is
a form of transportation.

00:30:33.800 --> 00:30:35.190 align:middle line:90%
But so is teleportation.

00:30:35.190 --> 00:30:35.990 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:30:35.990 --> 00:30:37.580 align:middle line:84%
>>ZEIZEL: And that often
can be very difficult.

00:30:37.580 --> 00:30:39.080 align:middle line:90%
If flying seems otherworldly--

00:30:39.080 --> 00:30:40.122 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah, teleport.

00:30:40.122 --> 00:30:43.820 align:middle line:84%
>>ZEIZEL: --teleporting
is supernatural.

00:30:43.820 --> 00:30:45.120 align:middle line:90%
And so with the--

00:30:45.120 --> 00:30:47.370 align:middle line:84%
something with teleportation,
just like a little thing

00:30:47.370 --> 00:30:49.340 align:middle line:84%
is like, all right,
well, we know

00:30:49.340 --> 00:30:50.820 align:middle line:90%
the dream world is malleable.

00:30:50.820 --> 00:30:54.290 align:middle line:84%
We know that it doesn't abide by
the physical laws of the waking

00:30:54.290 --> 00:30:55.262 align:middle line:90%
world.

00:30:55.262 --> 00:30:56.720 align:middle line:84%
So doing something
like, all right,

00:30:56.720 --> 00:30:58.470 align:middle line:84%
just closing your eyes
in the dream world.

00:30:58.470 --> 00:31:00.725 align:middle line:84%
And it's like, all right,
I'm in a field right now.

00:31:00.725 --> 00:31:01.850 align:middle line:90%
And I'm going to open them.

00:31:01.850 --> 00:31:05.030 align:middle line:84%
And I'm going to be in
the middle of the city.

00:31:05.030 --> 00:31:06.590 align:middle line:84%
Or, perhaps it's
usually the reverse.

00:31:06.590 --> 00:31:08.600 align:middle line:90%
You want to get out of the city.

00:31:08.600 --> 00:31:12.910 align:middle line:84%
But closing those eyes,
and then you open them,

00:31:12.910 --> 00:31:14.810 align:middle line:90%
it isn't 100% guarantee.

00:31:14.810 --> 00:31:20.750 align:middle line:84%
But it's a step towards making
that a reality and undoing,

00:31:20.750 --> 00:31:24.140 align:middle line:84%
again, the
programming that we've

00:31:24.140 --> 00:31:25.670 align:middle line:90%
sort of taken from this world.

00:31:25.670 --> 00:31:26.860 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:31:26.860 --> 00:31:28.240 align:middle line:90%
>>ZEIZEL: Now I talk about--

00:31:28.240 --> 00:31:30.950 align:middle line:84%
like, when I say undoing
programming from the waking

00:31:30.950 --> 00:31:33.648 align:middle line:84%
world, I don't mean it in
a purely negative sense.

00:31:33.648 --> 00:31:35.315 align:middle line:84%
Because we don't want
to necessarily try

00:31:35.315 --> 00:31:36.190 align:middle line:90%
to fly in this world.

00:31:36.190 --> 00:31:39.050 align:middle line:84%
We have to be aware of
the two different realms.

00:31:39.050 --> 00:31:39.878 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:31:39.878 --> 00:31:41.420 align:middle line:84%
>>ZEIZEL: But there's
a lot of stuff.

00:31:41.420 --> 00:31:45.380 align:middle line:84%
We've sort of pushed dreams to
the side in our modern culture.

00:31:45.380 --> 00:31:46.880 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And like
you say, when you

00:31:46.880 --> 00:31:50.350 align:middle line:84%
do these things-- these super
heroic types of ventures--

00:31:50.350 --> 00:31:52.880 align:middle line:84%
it actually can come back
and translate into increased

00:31:52.880 --> 00:31:55.010 align:middle line:90%
confidence in the waking world.

00:31:55.010 --> 00:31:55.970 align:middle line:90%
>>ZEIZEL: Totally.

00:31:55.970 --> 00:31:57.750 align:middle line:90%
And that's something that--

00:31:57.750 --> 00:32:00.000 align:middle line:84%
talking about giving a
presentation and being nervous.

00:32:00.000 --> 00:32:02.985 align:middle line:84%
It's like, when you can
fly, when you can teleport--

00:32:02.985 --> 00:32:05.360 align:middle line:84%
even if it's now, like in this
world-- but you actually--

00:32:05.360 --> 00:32:06.560 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: --at
your will, lucidly.

00:32:06.560 --> 00:32:06.900 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

00:32:06.900 --> 00:32:07.775 align:middle line:90%
>>ZEIZEL: Definitely.

00:32:07.775 --> 00:32:09.530 align:middle line:90%
And you get that sensation.

00:32:09.530 --> 00:32:12.145 align:middle line:84%
And you're fully aware
and conscious of that.

00:32:12.145 --> 00:32:14.270 align:middle line:84%
Well, giving a little
presentation, that's nothing.

00:32:14.270 --> 00:32:15.740 align:middle line:84%
You were just
flying around, like,

00:32:15.740 --> 00:32:17.278 align:middle line:90%
Mount Everest a few hours ago.

00:32:17.278 --> 00:32:19.820 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So it's a real-- to
be able to master dream time is

00:32:19.820 --> 00:32:20.998 align:middle line:90%
a real confidence-builder.

00:32:20.998 --> 00:32:22.040 align:middle line:90%
>>ZEIZEL: Oh, definitely.

00:32:22.040 --> 00:32:27.290 align:middle line:84%
And especially everything from
stuff like anxieties to fears,

00:32:27.290 --> 00:32:31.490 align:middle line:84%
it all can help you get the
confidence and the mental state

00:32:31.490 --> 00:32:32.550 align:middle line:90%
of mind to overcome that.

00:32:32.550 --> 00:32:33.350 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:32:33.350 --> 00:32:35.475 align:middle line:84%
What could you not work
out, really, in dream time?

00:32:35.475 --> 00:32:37.520 align:middle line:90%
Because anything is possible.

00:32:37.520 --> 00:32:41.630 align:middle line:84%
Theoretically, if you have even
an issue with another human

00:32:41.630 --> 00:32:43.770 align:middle line:84%
being-- a relationship
type of issue--

00:32:43.770 --> 00:32:45.770 align:middle line:84%
you should be able, if
you're in lucid dreaming,

00:32:45.770 --> 00:32:49.700 align:middle line:84%
to go in and consciously
address that, shouldn't you?

00:32:49.700 --> 00:32:52.830 align:middle line:84%
>>ZEIZEL: I actually
have had a dream.

00:32:52.830 --> 00:32:54.330 align:middle line:84%
This was a while
ago, but I remember

00:32:54.330 --> 00:32:56.540 align:middle line:84%
it very clearly
because at the time,

00:32:56.540 --> 00:33:00.030 align:middle line:84%
I was having a difficulty
with my brother.

00:33:00.030 --> 00:33:00.980 align:middle line:90%
It was in high school.

00:33:00.980 --> 00:33:04.880 align:middle line:84%
And as younger brothers go, they
tend to copy everything you do.

00:33:04.880 --> 00:33:07.910 align:middle line:84%
And being an older brother,
and a little teenage angst,

00:33:07.910 --> 00:33:09.720 align:middle line:84%
I just want to get
away from that.

00:33:09.720 --> 00:33:13.735 align:middle line:84%
And so I would, like, push
him aside in the waking world.

00:33:13.735 --> 00:33:15.860 align:middle line:84%
And then in the dream world,
he'd start showing up.

00:33:15.860 --> 00:33:16.902 align:middle line:90%
And I'd be like, oh, man.

00:33:16.902 --> 00:33:17.940 align:middle line:90%
Like, even in my dreams?

00:33:17.940 --> 00:33:19.110 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Can't
get away from him.

00:33:19.110 --> 00:33:20.030 align:middle line:90%
>>ZEIZEL: Yeah.

00:33:20.030 --> 00:33:24.500 align:middle line:84%
And so there was this
one dream we were having.

00:33:24.500 --> 00:33:28.760 align:middle line:84%
And we were actually in
the backyard of my house.

00:33:28.760 --> 00:33:31.700 align:middle line:84%
And then, it started to
turn into a nightmare.

00:33:31.700 --> 00:33:34.280 align:middle line:84%
And some people showed up,
and they shot my brother.

00:33:34.280 --> 00:33:35.368 align:middle line:90%
And I was like, oh.

00:33:35.368 --> 00:33:37.160 align:middle line:84%
Like, well, I can't
just push him away now.

00:33:37.160 --> 00:33:37.870 align:middle line:90%
He's bleeding.

00:33:37.870 --> 00:33:38.670 align:middle line:90%
He's dying.

00:33:38.670 --> 00:33:40.750 align:middle line:84%
I've got to get
him to a hospital.

00:33:40.750 --> 00:33:42.587 align:middle line:84%
And so in this
dream, I take him.

00:33:42.587 --> 00:33:43.920 align:middle line:90%
And I bring him to the hospital.

00:33:43.920 --> 00:33:45.480 align:middle line:90%
And they start fixing him up.

00:33:45.480 --> 00:33:47.480 align:middle line:84%
And then those people who
shot him, they turned.

00:33:47.480 --> 00:33:49.730 align:middle line:84%
They were people at first,
then they turned into monsters.

00:33:49.730 --> 00:33:51.147 align:middle line:84%
And they appeared
at the hospital.

00:33:51.147 --> 00:33:54.240 align:middle line:84%
And they started
shooting everyone.

00:33:54.240 --> 00:33:58.700 align:middle line:84%
And then at that point, I was
not lucid up until that moment.

00:33:58.700 --> 00:34:00.527 align:middle line:84%
And it was when
they shot something.

00:34:00.527 --> 00:34:02.110 align:middle line:84%
And I remember
reaching out because it

00:34:02.110 --> 00:34:04.080 align:middle line:84%
was going to my brother,
and I caught the bullet.

00:34:04.080 --> 00:34:05.330 align:middle line:90%
And I was like, wait a second.

00:34:05.330 --> 00:34:06.290 align:middle line:90%
I can't catch bullets.

00:34:06.290 --> 00:34:07.090 align:middle line:90%
This is a dream.

00:34:07.090 --> 00:34:09.380 align:middle line:84%
And I tell my dream
character of my brother,

00:34:09.380 --> 00:34:11.330 align:middle line:90%
like, this is a dream.

00:34:11.330 --> 00:34:12.860 align:middle line:84%
We need to get
rid of these guys.

00:34:12.860 --> 00:34:16.679 align:middle line:84%
So we fought these monsters
and got rid of them.

00:34:16.679 --> 00:34:19.940 align:middle line:84%
And then I woke up, I
realized, I shouldn't

00:34:19.940 --> 00:34:22.730 align:middle line:84%
push my brother away
for many reasons,

00:34:22.730 --> 00:34:24.690 align:middle line:84%
but that we're in
stuff together.

00:34:24.690 --> 00:34:26.460 align:middle line:90%
We're in this life together.

00:34:26.460 --> 00:34:28.980 align:middle line:84%
And while at times,
he's annoying and stuff,

00:34:28.980 --> 00:34:34.420 align:middle line:84%
it's important to remember that
there's not a malice in why

00:34:34.420 --> 00:34:36.117 align:middle line:90%
he wanted to hang out.

00:34:36.117 --> 00:34:38.659 align:middle line:84%
I don't quite know his reason,
but maybe a little admiration.

00:34:38.659 --> 00:34:39.659 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Exactly.

00:34:39.659 --> 00:34:41.420 align:middle line:84%
>>ZEIZEL: And that was
the important part.

00:34:41.420 --> 00:34:44.870 align:middle line:84%
And even through this
dream, I was able, then,

00:34:44.870 --> 00:34:50.120 align:middle line:84%
to bring back that idea of
becoming closer to my brother.

00:34:50.120 --> 00:34:51.290 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: That's beautiful.

00:34:51.290 --> 00:34:52.960 align:middle line:90%
So we're about out of time.

00:34:52.960 --> 00:34:57.500 align:middle line:10%
Do you think that mastering
our dream time might be,

00:34:57.500 --> 00:35:01.010 align:middle line:10%
really, one of the next
really big evolutionary steps

00:35:01.010 --> 00:35:02.340 align:middle line:10%
for humanity?

00:35:02.340 --> 00:35:04.120 align:middle line:90%
>>ZEIZEL: I would say so.

00:35:04.120 --> 00:35:06.710 align:middle line:84%
And it's funny,
because we think back

00:35:06.710 --> 00:35:09.922 align:middle line:84%
to our ancient tribes
and ancient people.

00:35:09.922 --> 00:35:11.630 align:middle line:84%
They already had
mastery of their dreams.

00:35:11.630 --> 00:35:12.560 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:35:12.560 --> 00:35:16.280 align:middle line:84%
>>ZEIZEL: And so it's
almost like we've evolved

00:35:16.280 --> 00:35:18.360 align:middle line:90%
wonderfully in many, many ways.

00:35:18.360 --> 00:35:20.660 align:middle line:84%
But we've also lost some
stuff in the process.

00:35:20.660 --> 00:35:23.210 align:middle line:84%
So I do think it's like
we should recapture that.

00:35:23.210 --> 00:35:26.890 align:middle line:84%
And that can bring
us to a new stage.

00:35:26.890 --> 00:35:29.720 align:middle line:84%
And looking at dreams,
it's not just this thing

00:35:29.720 --> 00:35:30.650 align:middle line:90%
that happens at night.

00:35:30.650 --> 00:35:31.910 align:middle line:90%
Oh, it's just a dream.

00:35:31.910 --> 00:35:35.870 align:middle line:84%
But really taking time out of
our lives and saying, like,

00:35:35.870 --> 00:35:37.347 align:middle line:90%
dreams are important.

00:35:37.347 --> 00:35:38.930 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: They're
very important, yes.

00:35:38.930 --> 00:35:41.330 align:middle line:84%
>>ZEIZEL: It's an inside
look to my subconscious.

00:35:41.330 --> 00:35:43.160 align:middle line:90%
I shouldn't just brush it off.

00:35:43.160 --> 00:35:44.800 align:middle line:90%
I should take the moment.

00:35:44.800 --> 00:35:48.050 align:middle line:84%
And even if it's just focusing
on dreams, lucid or not,

00:35:48.050 --> 00:35:49.200 align:middle line:90%
that's like one step.

00:35:49.200 --> 00:35:51.500 align:middle line:84%
But when you become
lucid, then you actually

00:35:51.500 --> 00:35:54.560 align:middle line:84%
can start interacting
with it and exploring it,

00:35:54.560 --> 00:35:56.557 align:middle line:90%
and reaching a new stage.

00:35:56.557 --> 00:35:58.640 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Well, I mean,
you certainly inspired me.

00:35:58.640 --> 00:36:01.110 align:middle line:84%
And I alluded to something
a little while ago.

00:36:01.110 --> 00:36:04.670 align:middle line:84%
And that is that when people
have kind of chronic sleeping

00:36:04.670 --> 00:36:05.720 align:middle line:90%
issues, for example--

00:36:05.720 --> 00:36:08.790 align:middle line:84%
I mean, most women I
know over the age of 40

00:36:08.790 --> 00:36:10.220 align:middle line:90%
don't sleep all that deeply.

00:36:10.220 --> 00:36:11.600 align:middle line:90%
They're in and out.

00:36:11.600 --> 00:36:15.770 align:middle line:10%
So their sleep itself
becomes so precious,

00:36:15.770 --> 00:36:18.620 align:middle line:10%
that they are very
reticent to give anything

00:36:18.620 --> 00:36:21.030 align:middle line:10%
up to remembering
dreams, for example.

00:36:21.030 --> 00:36:21.830 align:middle line:10%
It's like, oh, no.

00:36:21.830 --> 00:36:24.260 align:middle line:10%
If I wake up, my
brain will be awake.

00:36:24.260 --> 00:36:25.820 align:middle line:10%
I'll never get back to sleep.

00:36:25.820 --> 00:36:28.820 align:middle line:10%
And so you're talking
about the rest of the life,

00:36:28.820 --> 00:36:31.220 align:middle line:10%
oftentimes, just lost.

00:36:31.220 --> 00:36:33.530 align:middle line:84%
All the dreams lost
from that time on.

00:36:33.530 --> 00:36:36.140 align:middle line:84%
What kind of-- you said your
mom has gone through this.

00:36:36.140 --> 00:36:37.820 align:middle line:84%
What kind of advice
would you give

00:36:37.820 --> 00:36:41.300 align:middle line:84%
people that are just clinging
to any little shreds of sleep

00:36:41.300 --> 00:36:42.530 align:middle line:90%
they have?

00:36:42.530 --> 00:36:45.770 align:middle line:84%
>>ZEIZEL: Well, I sometimes
say, we look at sleep

00:36:45.770 --> 00:36:49.520 align:middle line:90%
as very important physically.

00:36:49.520 --> 00:36:52.490 align:middle line:84%
But dreams are
also very important

00:36:52.490 --> 00:36:54.080 align:middle line:90%
for our mental health.

00:36:54.080 --> 00:36:57.650 align:middle line:84%
And they've done studies
where if you skip over

00:36:57.650 --> 00:36:59.180 align:middle line:90%
your period of REM--

00:36:59.180 --> 00:37:02.200 align:middle line:84%
and actually, we
experience this.

00:37:02.200 --> 00:37:03.680 align:middle line:10%
You have to wake up early.

00:37:03.680 --> 00:37:05.840 align:middle line:10%
And then you're like, you have
a little time in the afternoon,

00:37:05.840 --> 00:37:06.640 align:middle line:10%
you take a nap.

00:37:06.640 --> 00:37:10.750 align:middle line:10%
And very often, you jump
right into the period of REM.

00:37:10.750 --> 00:37:14.540 align:middle line:10%
And so looking at sleep
as an important component,

00:37:14.540 --> 00:37:16.720 align:middle line:10%
but also dreams as a component--

00:37:16.720 --> 00:37:18.870 align:middle line:10%
>>REGINA: --as an equally
important component.

00:37:18.870 --> 00:37:19.910 align:middle line:90%
>>ZEIZEL: Yeah.

00:37:19.910 --> 00:37:20.710 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:37:20.710 --> 00:37:21.690 align:middle line:90%
That's a good point.

00:37:21.690 --> 00:37:24.890 align:middle line:84%
>>ZEIZEL: No stranger to, like,
our physical health, as well as

00:37:24.890 --> 00:37:26.300 align:middle line:90%
our mental health.

00:37:26.300 --> 00:37:29.630 align:middle line:84%
And dreams kind of take care
of the mental component,

00:37:29.630 --> 00:37:32.370 align:middle line:84%
while deep sleep takes care
of the physical component.

00:37:32.370 --> 00:37:33.410 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: And who knows?

00:37:33.410 --> 00:37:35.285 align:middle line:10%
Maybe if we're lucid
in our dream time,

00:37:35.285 --> 00:37:38.090 align:middle line:10%
we can even address the
subject of our nervous system

00:37:38.090 --> 00:37:40.880 align:middle line:10%
and our lack of sleep to get
deeper sleep and lucid dream.

00:37:40.880 --> 00:37:44.330 align:middle line:84%
>>ZEIZEL: Yeah, there's
so much to be explored.

00:37:44.330 --> 00:37:47.715 align:middle line:84%
And a great doorway into that
is through lucid dreaming.

00:37:47.715 --> 00:37:48.590 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Absolutely.

00:37:48.590 --> 00:37:50.160 align:middle line:90%
Well, we're out of time.

00:37:50.160 --> 00:37:52.260 align:middle line:84%
First of all, thank
Dylan and Thomas.

00:37:52.260 --> 00:37:53.442 align:middle line:90%
>>ZEIZEL: I will.

00:37:53.442 --> 00:37:55.400 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: I know they
couldn't be here as well.

00:37:55.400 --> 00:37:57.337 align:middle line:84%
But I really want
to thank all of you

00:37:57.337 --> 00:37:59.045 align:middle line:84%
for doing such a lovely
job on this book.

00:37:59.045 --> 00:38:01.940 align:middle line:84%
And sometimes, like I said,
it's the moment that the book

00:38:01.940 --> 00:38:03.500 align:middle line:90%
arrives and you think, yeah.

00:38:03.500 --> 00:38:06.420 align:middle line:84%
It's time begin another
level of mastery in life.

00:38:06.420 --> 00:38:08.593 align:middle line:84%
And I think you've done an
excellent guide to that.

00:38:08.593 --> 00:38:10.010 align:middle line:84%
>>ZEIZEL: Oh, thank
you very much.

00:38:10.010 --> 00:38:11.718 align:middle line:84%
And thank you for
having me on your show.

00:38:11.718 --> 00:38:12.890 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: You're so welcome.

00:38:12.890 --> 00:38:14.930 align:middle line:84%
Again, the name of the
book is "The Field Guide

00:38:14.930 --> 00:38:16.100 align:middle line:90%
to Lucid Dreaming".

00:38:16.100 --> 00:38:17.990 align:middle line:90%
And it's a truly useful book.

00:38:17.990 --> 00:38:18.830 align:middle line:90%
I love the book.

00:38:18.830 --> 00:38:20.600 align:middle line:10%
I'll be giving it
to people as gifts.

00:38:20.600 --> 00:38:22.123 align:middle line:10%
Also, if you enjoyed
this interview,

00:38:22.123 --> 00:38:23.540 align:middle line:10%
you might also
enjoy my interviews
