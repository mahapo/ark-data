00:00:28.334 --> 00:00:30.750 align:middle line:10%
>>REGINA MEREDITH: In my last
conversation with Dr. Donese

00:00:30.750 --> 00:00:33.540 align:middle line:10%
Worden, we dove into the
truth about cancer therapies.

00:00:33.540 --> 00:00:35.190 align:middle line:84%
It was a story
with not only hope,

00:00:35.190 --> 00:00:37.440 align:middle line:84%
but the fact that our
understanding of cancer

00:00:37.440 --> 00:00:38.640 align:middle line:90%
has turned a corner.

00:00:38.640 --> 00:00:40.440 align:middle line:84%
Today we add the
element of energy

00:00:40.440 --> 00:00:42.420 align:middle line:84%
into the story,
and healing pain,

00:00:42.420 --> 00:00:45.180 align:middle line:84%
among many, many other chronic
conditions, of which cancer

00:00:45.180 --> 00:00:46.430 align:middle line:90%
really is a chronic condition.

00:00:46.430 --> 00:00:47.160 align:middle line:90%
>>DONESE WORDEN: That's true.

00:00:47.160 --> 00:00:49.201 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So it's just
another chronic condition.

00:00:49.201 --> 00:00:51.330 align:middle line:84%
And, I mean, before
we go into anything,

00:00:51.330 --> 00:00:54.630 align:middle line:84%
let's talk about the
nature of chronic.

00:00:54.630 --> 00:00:57.930 align:middle line:84%
Because our medical system
treats everything as though

00:00:57.930 --> 00:00:59.190 align:middle line:90%
it's--

00:00:59.190 --> 00:01:00.640 align:middle line:90%
well, only symptomatic.

00:01:00.640 --> 00:01:01.440 align:middle line:90%
Right?

00:01:01.440 --> 00:01:06.540 align:middle line:84%
But in fact, give us an
array of all of the diseases

00:01:06.540 --> 00:01:09.120 align:middle line:84%
we deal with that are in
fact chronic by nature,

00:01:09.120 --> 00:01:11.040 align:middle line:84%
and that should be
treated in a way that

00:01:11.040 --> 00:01:12.250 align:middle line:90%
is appropriate for that.

00:01:12.250 --> 00:01:13.050 align:middle line:90%
Long term.

00:01:13.050 --> 00:01:14.174 align:middle line:90%
>>WORDEN: All the big ones.

00:01:14.174 --> 00:01:17.500 align:middle line:10%
You mentioned
cancer, but diabetes,

00:01:17.500 --> 00:01:20.940 align:middle line:10%
cardiovascular disease,
autoimmune, rheumatoid

00:01:20.940 --> 00:01:23.190 align:middle line:10%
arthritis-- all of
the big diseases

00:01:23.190 --> 00:01:26.760 align:middle line:10%
that we deal with are chronic
degenerative diseases.

00:01:26.760 --> 00:01:29.280 align:middle line:10%
And many of them can
respond very well

00:01:29.280 --> 00:01:32.350 align:middle line:10%
to alternative lifestyles
and natural therapies.

00:01:32.350 --> 00:01:33.150 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:01:33.150 --> 00:01:35.760 align:middle line:84%
I mean, because really, we're
throwing a Band-Aid on it.

00:01:35.760 --> 00:01:39.060 align:middle line:84%
Just masking symptoms
with traditional medicine

00:01:39.060 --> 00:01:39.900 align:middle line:90%
almost all the time.

00:01:39.900 --> 00:01:42.280 align:middle line:84%
And you're both a traditional
and naturopathic doc.

00:01:42.280 --> 00:01:43.845 align:middle line:84%
You're an MD-- a
naturopathic MD.

00:01:43.845 --> 00:01:45.250 align:middle line:84%
You know both
sides of the story.

00:01:45.250 --> 00:01:46.050 align:middle line:90%
>>WORDEN: Right.

00:01:46.050 --> 00:01:47.700 align:middle line:84%
So I tell patients,
they'll say, well,

00:01:47.700 --> 00:01:49.770 align:middle line:84%
this medicine-- they'll come in,
we'll have a list of medicines

00:01:49.770 --> 00:01:51.150 align:middle line:84%
when they first come
in, and I'll say,

00:01:51.150 --> 00:01:52.110 align:middle line:90%
is this one helping you?

00:01:52.110 --> 00:01:53.151 align:middle line:90%
First, why are you on it?

00:01:53.151 --> 00:01:54.878 align:middle line:90%
No, I don't know.

00:01:54.878 --> 00:01:56.260 align:middle line:90%
First of all, that's not good.

00:01:56.260 --> 00:01:59.554 align:middle line:84%
And second of all, if you do
know why it is, is it helping?

00:01:59.554 --> 00:02:00.970 align:middle line:84%
And they'll say,
I don't think so.

00:02:00.970 --> 00:02:03.000 align:middle line:90%
Then why are we still on it?

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:04.710 align:middle line:84%
But if they do
think it's helping,

00:02:04.710 --> 00:02:07.680 align:middle line:84%
then I have to explain it's
like leaving a fire going

00:02:07.680 --> 00:02:09.470 align:middle line:90%
and turning the fire alarm off.

00:02:09.470 --> 00:02:12.420 align:middle line:84%
Your body will give
you another symptom

00:02:12.420 --> 00:02:14.550 align:middle line:84%
somewhere else if you're
not paying attention

00:02:14.550 --> 00:02:15.870 align:middle line:90%
to the original one.

00:02:15.870 --> 00:02:18.895 align:middle line:84%
We're not about masking or
turning off fire alarms.

00:02:18.895 --> 00:02:20.770 align:middle line:84%
We're about finding
what's causing that fire,

00:02:20.770 --> 00:02:22.060 align:middle line:90%
and let's fix that.

00:02:22.060 --> 00:02:22.860 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:02:22.860 --> 00:02:26.280 align:middle line:84%
And unfortunately, the model
most people are plugged into

00:02:26.280 --> 00:02:28.700 align:middle line:84%
is about turning
off the fire alarm.

00:02:28.700 --> 00:02:32.130 align:middle line:84%
>>WORDEN: In reality, some,
if you turn off the fire alarm

00:02:32.130 --> 00:02:34.680 align:middle line:84%
and they feel better for a
short period of time, hopefully

00:02:34.680 --> 00:02:36.945 align:middle line:84%
the body will heal itself
in that time period anyway.

00:02:36.945 --> 00:02:39.240 align:middle line:84%
I think it is Hippocrates
says, you know, we just--

00:02:39.240 --> 00:02:40.500 align:middle line:84%
we're dealing with
your mind, keeping

00:02:40.500 --> 00:02:42.500 align:middle line:84%
your mind busy with
medicine while the body does

00:02:42.500 --> 00:02:43.890 align:middle line:90%
the healing.

00:02:43.890 --> 00:02:46.170 align:middle line:84%
And that's that truth
with modern medicine

00:02:46.170 --> 00:02:47.830 align:middle line:84%
and traditional
medicine as well.

00:02:47.830 --> 00:02:49.994 align:middle line:84%
Even though they may
be masking a symptom,

00:02:49.994 --> 00:02:52.410 align:middle line:84%
it might be long enough for
you to think that you're well,

00:02:52.410 --> 00:02:53.910 align:middle line:90%
so the body can actually heal.

00:02:53.910 --> 00:02:55.150 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: OK, now I
have a little theory.

00:02:55.150 --> 00:02:55.950 align:middle line:90%
>>WORDEN: OK.

00:02:55.950 --> 00:02:58.380 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: When it comes
to colds, all right?

00:02:58.380 --> 00:03:00.350 align:middle line:84%
And I get a cold
every, maybe, I don't

00:03:00.350 --> 00:03:02.280 align:middle line:84%
know, maybe every 18
months or two years

00:03:02.280 --> 00:03:03.400 align:middle line:90%
I'll get an actual cold.

00:03:03.400 --> 00:03:04.200 align:middle line:90%
Right?

00:03:04.200 --> 00:03:09.510 align:middle line:84%
And my theory is that
if you take a reliever,

00:03:09.510 --> 00:03:14.160 align:middle line:84%
like an anticongestant
or whatever,

00:03:14.160 --> 00:03:17.070 align:middle line:84%
and you feel better, that
I will heal better faster,

00:03:17.070 --> 00:03:18.390 align:middle line:90%
because I feel better.

00:03:18.390 --> 00:03:20.250 align:middle line:84%
Rather than feeling
crummy and just

00:03:20.250 --> 00:03:22.410 align:middle line:84%
having it drag on, because
then I think I'm sick.

00:03:22.410 --> 00:03:23.730 align:middle line:84%
>>WORDEN: And that's
what I'm talking about.

00:03:23.730 --> 00:03:24.400 align:middle line:90%
Those kinds of gains--

00:03:24.400 --> 00:03:25.200 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: The gap.

00:03:25.200 --> 00:03:26.190 align:middle line:90%
>>WORDEN: The gap.

00:03:26.190 --> 00:03:29.160 align:middle line:84%
That placebo effect,
which is real, by the way.

00:03:29.160 --> 00:03:31.110 align:middle line:84%
Because when we believe
something is working,

00:03:31.110 --> 00:03:32.940 align:middle line:84%
or we believe
we're better, we're

00:03:32.940 --> 00:03:36.850 align:middle line:84%
releasing our own pharmacy,
so it is working, right?

00:03:36.850 --> 00:03:38.100 align:middle line:90%
But you want to leave a fever.

00:03:38.100 --> 00:03:40.200 align:middle line:84%
The only thing I'd say about
that is, if you have a fever,

00:03:40.200 --> 00:03:41.000 align:middle line:90%
leave that alone.

00:03:41.000 --> 00:03:42.100 align:middle line:90%
Don't bring that down.

00:03:42.100 --> 00:03:44.522 align:middle line:84%
That is your body's immune
system doing its fight.

00:03:44.522 --> 00:03:45.480 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: I do do that.

00:03:45.480 --> 00:03:46.830 align:middle line:84%
>>WORDEN: But all the other
stuff, yeah, you know--

00:03:46.830 --> 00:03:47.280 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: The runny
nose and all that.

00:03:47.280 --> 00:03:48.670 align:middle line:90%
>>WORDEN: Sleep better-- yeah.

00:03:48.670 --> 00:03:49.616 align:middle line:90%
Right.

00:03:49.616 --> 00:03:50.666 align:middle line:90%
And I'm OK with that.

00:03:50.666 --> 00:03:53.040 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: It's the first time
I've actually asked anyone,

00:03:53.040 --> 00:03:55.670 align:middle line:84%
because I tend not to go
to doctors to begin with,

00:03:55.670 --> 00:03:57.530 align:middle line:90%
but thank you for sharing that.

00:03:57.530 --> 00:04:02.160 align:middle line:84%
And so, to me, what
has always been

00:04:02.160 --> 00:04:04.950 align:middle line:84%
fascinating is that if
you look at the human body

00:04:04.950 --> 00:04:07.740 align:middle line:84%
on an atomic level, there
isn't any mass there.

00:04:07.740 --> 00:04:08.640 align:middle line:90%
We're all energy.

00:04:08.640 --> 00:04:09.540 align:middle line:90%
We're all space.

00:04:09.540 --> 00:04:10.498 align:middle line:90%
>>WORDEN: That's right.

00:04:10.498 --> 00:04:14.640 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Every single atom in
the body is space and energy.

00:04:14.640 --> 00:04:18.990 align:middle line:84%
And space that interfaces
with information of all kinds,

00:04:18.990 --> 00:04:19.790 align:middle line:90%
right?

00:04:19.790 --> 00:04:20.880 align:middle line:90%
>>WORDEN: That's exactly right.

00:04:20.880 --> 00:04:22.400 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So that
is where I wanted

00:04:22.400 --> 00:04:28.220 align:middle line:84%
to launch into why energy
medicines are so incredibly

00:04:28.220 --> 00:04:29.020 align:middle line:90%
effective.

00:04:29.020 --> 00:04:31.290 align:middle line:84%
Because they have
been so marginalized

00:04:31.290 --> 00:04:33.660 align:middle line:90%
since Dinshah Color Therapy.

00:04:33.660 --> 00:04:36.750 align:middle line:84%
Rife, and the beautiful work
he was doing, and on and on

00:04:36.750 --> 00:04:38.710 align:middle line:90%
through our modern history.

00:04:38.710 --> 00:04:41.130 align:middle line:84%
Let's talk about the
history of energy medicine--

00:04:41.130 --> 00:04:42.024 align:middle line:90%
>>WORDEN: Right.

00:04:42.024 --> 00:04:43.440 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: --all
the way up to now,

00:04:43.440 --> 00:04:45.900 align:middle line:84%
and the incredible advances
in energy medicine.

00:04:45.900 --> 00:04:48.480 align:middle line:84%
But first, set the
template as to why it's

00:04:48.480 --> 00:04:50.430 align:middle line:90%
so effective in the human body.

00:04:50.430 --> 00:04:52.830 align:middle line:84%
>>WORDEN: Well, you prefaced
that by talking about,

00:04:52.830 --> 00:04:53.710 align:middle line:90%
we are energy.

00:04:53.710 --> 00:04:54.510 align:middle line:90%
We're all energy.

00:04:54.510 --> 00:04:56.155 align:middle line:90%
Every cell talks to one another.

00:04:56.155 --> 00:04:57.030 align:middle line:90%
They're not separate.

00:04:57.030 --> 00:04:58.910 align:middle line:84%
The knee bone is
connected to the shinbone,

00:04:58.910 --> 00:05:00.990 align:middle line:90%
like the old song, right?

00:05:00.990 --> 00:05:02.830 align:middle line:90%
But everything is connected.

00:05:02.830 --> 00:05:06.270 align:middle line:84%
And if you do something
to shake one molecule,

00:05:06.270 --> 00:05:08.820 align:middle line:84%
it shakes the entire tree,
which is our entire body.

00:05:08.820 --> 00:05:11.070 align:middle line:84%
There's many ways
to get to that.

00:05:11.070 --> 00:05:13.260 align:middle line:84%
Emotionally,
spiritually, physically.

00:05:13.260 --> 00:05:17.130 align:middle line:84%
Many ways to tap into that
energy system of ours.

00:05:17.130 --> 00:05:18.780 align:middle line:84%
We look at, in
traditional medicine,

00:05:18.780 --> 00:05:21.390 align:middle line:84%
the cardiovascular systems--
we have a blood flow,

00:05:21.390 --> 00:05:24.290 align:middle line:84%
we have a lymphatic flow, and
we have the nervous system.

00:05:24.290 --> 00:05:27.050 align:middle line:90%
There's an entire other system.

00:05:27.050 --> 00:05:29.410 align:middle line:84%
And it's like a
tensegrity system.

00:05:29.410 --> 00:05:32.140 align:middle line:84%
And that energy
body, which now we're

00:05:32.140 --> 00:05:35.020 align:middle line:84%
starting where we can
measure pieces of that

00:05:35.020 --> 00:05:36.580 align:middle line:90%
to know that it is real.

00:05:36.580 --> 00:05:39.640 align:middle line:84%
We can quantify
that energy body.

00:05:39.640 --> 00:05:41.500 align:middle line:90%
Now, let's start working there.

00:05:41.500 --> 00:05:43.990 align:middle line:84%
Because there are
no real side effects

00:05:43.990 --> 00:05:46.450 align:middle line:84%
if you're giving the body
the energy, or at least

00:05:46.450 --> 00:05:48.730 align:middle line:84%
the communication that
it needs, to heal.

00:05:48.730 --> 00:05:50.890 align:middle line:90%
And again, many ways to do that.

00:05:50.890 --> 00:05:52.170 align:middle line:90%
You've mentioned a few.

00:05:52.170 --> 00:05:54.520 align:middle line:84%
Color therapy, music,
all these things.

00:05:54.520 --> 00:05:56.890 align:middle line:84%
Because that, again,
is just talking

00:05:56.890 --> 00:05:58.710 align:middle line:90%
to this tensegrity system.

00:05:58.710 --> 00:06:00.730 align:middle line:90%
It's kind of like a matrix.

00:06:00.730 --> 00:06:02.350 align:middle line:84%
And I talk to the
patients about,

00:06:02.350 --> 00:06:05.546 align:middle line:84%
your body has a matrix outside
of your nervous system,

00:06:05.546 --> 00:06:07.420 align:middle line:84%
and your blood, and all
these things which we

00:06:07.420 --> 00:06:08.690 align:middle line:90%
don't talk about in medicine.

00:06:08.690 --> 00:06:11.500 align:middle line:84%
But this is the most
exciting piece of medicine

00:06:11.500 --> 00:06:12.400 align:middle line:90%
that I work with.

00:06:12.400 --> 00:06:14.350 align:middle line:90%
And that's my favorite topic.

00:06:14.350 --> 00:06:17.050 align:middle line:84%
And even when I'm lecturing
for medical doctors

00:06:17.050 --> 00:06:19.870 align:middle line:84%
or other physicians with
our medical education,

00:06:19.870 --> 00:06:22.090 align:middle line:84%
my favorite subject
to lecture on

00:06:22.090 --> 00:06:24.550 align:middle line:90%
is teaching the energy medicine.

00:06:24.550 --> 00:06:26.140 align:middle line:90%
The energetic body.

00:06:26.140 --> 00:06:29.170 align:middle line:84%
And a good place for
your listeners to go

00:06:29.170 --> 00:06:31.510 align:middle line:84%
is James Oschman,
who's written a book--

00:06:31.510 --> 00:06:33.700 align:middle line:84%
"Energy Medicine: The
Scientific Basis."

00:06:33.700 --> 00:06:35.380 align:middle line:84%
It's an easy read,
it's a fun read,

00:06:35.380 --> 00:06:37.660 align:middle line:84%
and it gives you some of
the science behind some

00:06:37.660 --> 00:06:39.410 align:middle line:84%
of the studies and the
concepts that we'll

00:06:39.410 --> 00:06:40.810 align:middle line:90%
be talking about today.

00:06:40.810 --> 00:06:43.540 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And so are you
speaking of the acupuncture

00:06:43.540 --> 00:06:45.100 align:middle line:84%
meridians system,
or beyond that?

00:06:45.100 --> 00:06:46.765 align:middle line:84%
Something that
supersedes even that,

00:06:46.765 --> 00:06:48.150 align:middle line:90%
that interpenetrates that all.

00:06:48.150 --> 00:06:48.400 align:middle line:90%
>>WORDEN: Right.

00:06:48.400 --> 00:06:49.610 align:middle line:90%
So it's beyond that.

00:06:49.610 --> 00:06:53.590 align:middle line:84%
So the acupuncture meridians
we see as kind of portals

00:06:53.590 --> 00:06:55.760 align:middle line:90%
to tap into this whole matrix.

00:06:55.760 --> 00:06:58.570 align:middle line:84%
So if you look at, like,
a bunch of little squares.

00:06:58.570 --> 00:07:02.860 align:middle line:84%
And those acupuncture meridians
that we studied in school

00:07:02.860 --> 00:07:04.710 align:middle line:84%
and have been around
for thousands of years,

00:07:04.710 --> 00:07:06.190 align:middle line:90%
there's just good ways in.

00:07:06.190 --> 00:07:09.010 align:middle line:84%
So if I'm putting
a needle there,

00:07:09.010 --> 00:07:12.760 align:middle line:84%
or I'm putting a laser
there, any energy

00:07:12.760 --> 00:07:16.900 align:middle line:84%
tapping into that portal talks
to the rest of the matrix

00:07:16.900 --> 00:07:19.226 align:middle line:90%
easier and better.

00:07:19.226 --> 00:07:20.350 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: And I'm with you.

00:07:20.350 --> 00:07:22.330 align:middle line:84%
I have been fascinated
with it for many years.

00:07:22.330 --> 00:07:25.540 align:middle line:84%
And my fascination started
originally with color therapy,

00:07:25.540 --> 00:07:26.900 align:middle line:90%
about 25 years ago.

00:07:26.900 --> 00:07:28.040 align:middle line:90%
And I was obsessed with it.

00:07:28.040 --> 00:07:29.650 align:middle line:90%
Read every book I could find.

00:07:29.650 --> 00:07:30.460 align:middle line:90%
Gave little--

00:07:30.460 --> 00:07:30.930 align:middle line:90%
>>WORDEN: Mandel.

00:07:30.930 --> 00:07:31.980 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: --gave
little lectures on it.

00:07:31.980 --> 00:07:32.530 align:middle line:90%
Right.

00:07:32.530 --> 00:07:32.910 align:middle line:90%
>>WORDEN: Right.

00:07:32.910 --> 00:07:33.710 align:middle line:90%
Right.

00:07:33.710 --> 00:07:36.190 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So because this
is a passion of yours,

00:07:36.190 --> 00:07:37.900 align:middle line:90%
you functionally work with it.

00:07:37.900 --> 00:07:39.670 align:middle line:90%
You have a clinic that's--

00:07:39.670 --> 00:07:41.429 align:middle line:84%
what is the name of
your clinic again?

00:07:41.429 --> 00:07:42.970 align:middle line:84%
>>WORDEN: I have
two medical clinics.

00:07:42.970 --> 00:07:47.170 align:middle line:84%
Repower Medical Clinic, where I
see my medically-based patients

00:07:47.170 --> 00:07:49.750 align:middle line:84%
that want naturopathic medicine,
or pain management, whatever

00:07:49.750 --> 00:07:50.890 align:middle line:90%
they're coming for.

00:07:50.890 --> 00:07:53.290 align:middle line:84%
And then I have a new
clinic called Lite Life,

00:07:53.290 --> 00:07:56.110 align:middle line:84%
and those will be replicated
across the United States.

00:07:56.110 --> 00:07:58.600 align:middle line:84%
And those really are
about energy medicine.

00:07:58.600 --> 00:08:01.810 align:middle line:84%
It's a lite life in using
cold lasers and frequency

00:08:01.810 --> 00:08:04.610 align:middle line:90%
medicine for different things.

00:08:04.610 --> 00:08:07.750 align:middle line:84%
Mostly those are looking
into natural ways

00:08:07.750 --> 00:08:09.169 align:middle line:90%
of natural aesthetics.

00:08:09.169 --> 00:08:10.960 align:middle line:84%
Because people are
looking for a way there,

00:08:10.960 --> 00:08:14.110 align:middle line:84%
and I want to guide them into
understanding that you can

00:08:14.110 --> 00:08:16.660 align:middle line:84%
build your own collagen.
You can work on things

00:08:16.660 --> 00:08:19.240 align:middle line:84%
that aesthetically you're
not really pleased with.

00:08:19.240 --> 00:08:21.430 align:middle line:84%
But if you don't
want the surgery,

00:08:21.430 --> 00:08:24.340 align:middle line:84%
if you don't want the Botox,
if you don't want the fillers,

00:08:24.340 --> 00:08:28.450 align:middle line:84%
there's ways for us to age
gracefully and with ease,

00:08:28.450 --> 00:08:30.160 align:middle line:90%
and to look healthy.

00:08:30.160 --> 00:08:32.890 align:middle line:84%
And that's what those
clinics are based upon.

00:08:32.890 --> 00:08:35.029 align:middle line:84%
And it is using
frequency medicine.

00:08:35.029 --> 00:08:37.320 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And it's interesting,
because we think about,

00:08:37.320 --> 00:08:39.932 align:middle line:84%
one is vanity and the other
is health, but in reality--

00:08:39.932 --> 00:08:41.140 align:middle line:90%
>>WORDEN: They're all health.

00:08:41.140 --> 00:08:42.306 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: --it's all health.

00:08:42.306 --> 00:08:44.980 align:middle line:84%
Because even with the
mind/body connection,

00:08:44.980 --> 00:08:46.845 align:middle line:84%
as we're living longer
and longer now--

00:08:46.845 --> 00:08:48.970 align:middle line:84%
not necessarily better and
better-- but some people

00:08:48.970 --> 00:08:51.520 align:middle line:84%
are living longer and
better, because they're

00:08:51.520 --> 00:08:54.160 align:middle line:84%
starting to understand
the nature of health.

00:08:54.160 --> 00:08:57.880 align:middle line:84%
You know, it's a challenge,
as people go through the aging

00:08:57.880 --> 00:09:00.219 align:middle line:84%
process, to see they don't
look like they feel anymore.

00:09:00.219 --> 00:09:01.510 align:middle line:90%
>>WORDEN: That's exactly right.

00:09:01.510 --> 00:09:04.300 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And then that starts
bringing kind of a negative

00:09:04.300 --> 00:09:07.272 align:middle line:84%
element of thinking
in, that is starting--

00:09:07.272 --> 00:09:08.230 align:middle line:90%
>>WORDEN: That's right.

00:09:08.230 --> 00:09:09.130 align:middle line:90%
I look in the mirror.

00:09:09.130 --> 00:09:10.480 align:middle line:84%
I must be getting
old, because I sure

00:09:10.480 --> 00:09:11.800 align:middle line:90%
don't feel like that person.

00:09:11.800 --> 00:09:12.220 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:09:12.220 --> 00:09:13.020 align:middle line:90%
Right.

00:09:13.020 --> 00:09:15.719 align:middle line:84%
>>WORDEN: And so that is
part of our spiritual,

00:09:15.719 --> 00:09:17.260 align:middle line:84%
emotional-- you'd
like to say that we

00:09:17.260 --> 00:09:19.780 align:middle line:84%
were so spiritually connected
that it wouldn't matter.

00:09:19.780 --> 00:09:20.860 align:middle line:90%
That it doesn't matter.

00:09:20.860 --> 00:09:21.660 align:middle line:90%
And that is--

00:09:21.660 --> 00:09:22.576 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: But it does.

00:09:22.576 --> 00:09:24.295 align:middle line:84%
>>WORDEN: --what we're
all striving for.

00:09:24.295 --> 00:09:27.340 align:middle line:84%
But until we get
there, I'd like to look

00:09:27.340 --> 00:09:29.350 align:middle line:84%
as well as I can
look, in health,

00:09:29.350 --> 00:09:31.210 align:middle line:90%
without negative consequences.

00:09:31.210 --> 00:09:32.410 align:middle line:90%
I'm not a fan of Botox.

00:09:32.410 --> 00:09:34.997 align:middle line:84%
It's the most potent
neurotoxin known to man.

00:09:34.997 --> 00:09:37.330 align:middle line:84%
I think in the long run we're
going to look back and go,

00:09:37.330 --> 00:09:38.288 align:middle line:90%
why were we doing that?

00:09:38.288 --> 00:09:39.490 align:middle line:90%
I could be wrong.

00:09:39.490 --> 00:09:42.430 align:middle line:84%
But in the meantime, my
intuition as a physician tells

00:09:42.430 --> 00:09:45.380 align:middle line:90%
me I'm not a fan of Botox.

00:09:45.380 --> 00:09:46.180 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: OK.

00:09:46.180 --> 00:09:53.350 align:middle line:84%
So I heard a story I was told
by a man who knew this woman.

00:09:53.350 --> 00:09:58.540 align:middle line:84%
And he actually helped her
daughter win a large beauty

00:09:58.540 --> 00:10:02.770 align:middle line:84%
pageant that had significant
effect on her chances

00:10:02.770 --> 00:10:06.400 align:middle line:84%
at marriage in life, and that
was the whole point, right?

00:10:06.400 --> 00:10:07.630 align:middle line:90%
The girl and the mother.

00:10:07.630 --> 00:10:12.370 align:middle line:84%
And the mother had started
using massive amounts of Botox.

00:10:12.370 --> 00:10:16.090 align:middle line:84%
And what he said
happened to her is,

00:10:16.090 --> 00:10:18.940 align:middle line:84%
everything became weaker
and weaker and weaker

00:10:18.940 --> 00:10:20.320 align:middle line:90%
as a result of it.

00:10:20.320 --> 00:10:24.250 align:middle line:84%
And she ended up aging
incredibly rapidly,

00:10:24.250 --> 00:10:28.800 align:middle line:84%
because all of her face, and
neck, whatever she was doing,

00:10:28.800 --> 00:10:30.930 align:middle line:90%
lost all of its tonality.

00:10:30.930 --> 00:10:32.936 align:middle line:84%
So while we're on
that subject, let's

00:10:32.936 --> 00:10:35.310 align:middle line:84%
go ahead and talk about what
is actually happening there.

00:10:35.310 --> 00:10:38.430 align:middle line:84%
>>WORDEN: So whether it's
chemical peels, whether it's

00:10:38.430 --> 00:10:41.100 align:middle line:84%
a hot laser, anytime
you do damage

00:10:41.100 --> 00:10:43.520 align:middle line:84%
to the cells, when
it sloughs off,

00:10:43.520 --> 00:10:45.270 align:middle line:84%
you can look shiny and
pretty for a while.

00:10:45.270 --> 00:10:47.970 align:middle line:84%
But in the meantime, you've
taken off the protective layer.

00:10:47.970 --> 00:10:51.770 align:middle line:84%
And in the long run, you'll
have more laxicity, maybe.

00:10:51.770 --> 00:10:53.160 align:middle line:90%
It depends on the technique.

00:10:53.160 --> 00:10:54.720 align:middle line:84%
Some of them actually
can help build

00:10:54.720 --> 00:10:57.960 align:middle line:84%
some collagen. But some
laxicity, and thinner skin.

00:10:57.960 --> 00:11:00.180 align:middle line:84%
When you look at
the Hollywood stars

00:11:00.180 --> 00:11:03.960 align:middle line:84%
and you see them start looking
gray, thin, thin skin from so

00:11:03.960 --> 00:11:07.110 align:middle line:84%
many procedures, the reason
why they're looking gray

00:11:07.110 --> 00:11:10.380 align:middle line:84%
is they thin the skin so much
there's no collagen left,

00:11:10.380 --> 00:11:12.720 align:middle line:84%
and you can see the
blue vessels, like you

00:11:12.720 --> 00:11:16.530 align:middle line:84%
can see your blue veins in
your arms, with that thin skin.

00:11:16.530 --> 00:11:20.010 align:middle line:84%
So my philosophy is, we
want to build collagen. I

00:11:20.010 --> 00:11:21.559 align:middle line:90%
don't want to slough too much.

00:11:21.559 --> 00:11:23.850 align:middle line:84%
We can use some natural
exfoliants, that kind of thing,

00:11:23.850 --> 00:11:24.650 align:middle line:90%
lightly.

00:11:24.650 --> 00:11:27.510 align:middle line:84%
But if you're really,
really thinning the skin,

00:11:27.510 --> 00:11:30.630 align:middle line:84%
in the long run, that may not
be the best thing for people.

00:11:30.630 --> 00:11:31.430 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:11:31.430 --> 00:11:32.230 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:11:32.230 --> 00:11:34.290 align:middle line:84%
Well, now, you got into
energy medicine, not--

00:11:34.290 --> 00:11:36.206 align:middle line:84%
and we'll go back to
this subject, because I'm

00:11:36.206 --> 00:11:38.730 align:middle line:84%
sure a lot of our viewers
are interested in ways

00:11:38.730 --> 00:11:41.940 align:middle line:84%
they can stay as youthful
as possible without damaging

00:11:41.940 --> 00:11:42.900 align:middle line:90%
themselves.

00:11:42.900 --> 00:11:46.440 align:middle line:84%
But you did this originally
for pain management.

00:11:46.440 --> 00:11:48.270 align:middle line:84%
And you've worked
in some research,

00:11:48.270 --> 00:11:52.140 align:middle line:84%

00:12:14.010 --> 00:12:16.670 align:middle line:84%
couldn't walk, couldn't
move their arm, leg,

00:12:16.670 --> 00:12:17.470 align:middle line:90%
and couldn't speak.

00:12:17.470 --> 00:12:18.480 align:middle line:90%
Aphasia.

00:12:18.480 --> 00:12:20.130 align:middle line:90%
And had the drop.

00:12:20.130 --> 00:12:23.340 align:middle line:84%
But it was a quality of life,
of how to help this person.

00:12:23.340 --> 00:12:26.010 align:middle line:84%
And I was actually in
medical school at the time.

00:12:26.010 --> 00:12:28.812 align:middle line:84%
And I went to a
chiropractor friend of mine,

00:12:28.812 --> 00:12:30.270 align:middle line:84%
and I said this is
what's going on.

00:12:30.270 --> 00:12:30.900 align:middle line:90%
What do you have?

00:12:30.900 --> 00:12:32.550 align:middle line:84%
And he says, well, there
are these cold lasers,

00:12:32.550 --> 00:12:34.425 align:middle line:84%
and they work neurologically
to help rebuild,

00:12:34.425 --> 00:12:35.580 align:middle line:90%
and I said let's do it.

00:12:35.580 --> 00:12:37.080 align:middle line:84%
Because we're using
it with athletes

00:12:37.080 --> 00:12:39.090 align:middle line:84%
to make them faster,
stronger, better.

00:12:39.090 --> 00:12:41.492 align:middle line:84%
Neurologically connect things
so that they could work.

00:12:41.492 --> 00:12:43.950 align:middle line:84%
I said, why are we not using
the same kinds of technologies

00:12:43.950 --> 00:12:46.560 align:middle line:84%
on these neurologically
damaged patients?

00:12:46.560 --> 00:12:49.260 align:middle line:84%
So I started working
with it at that point,

00:12:49.260 --> 00:12:51.450 align:middle line:84%
and brought that patient
to a full function of life,

00:12:51.450 --> 00:12:52.650 align:middle line:90%
and doing well.

00:12:52.650 --> 00:12:54.510 align:middle line:84%
Some neurological
damage, just because she

00:12:54.510 --> 00:12:57.420 align:middle line:84%
wasn't willing to do all
the work that she really

00:12:57.420 --> 00:12:59.040 align:middle line:90%
needed to do mechanically.

00:12:59.040 --> 00:13:01.770 align:middle line:84%
But came back to a very
good quality of life.

00:13:01.770 --> 00:13:04.110 align:middle line:84%
So that got me
interested, and I started

00:13:04.110 --> 00:13:06.420 align:middle line:84%
studying then the
Russian technologies,

00:13:06.420 --> 00:13:09.030 align:middle line:84%
the Russian science that
had been done on frequency

00:13:09.030 --> 00:13:11.280 align:middle line:84%
medicine, because I
clinically saw it working,

00:13:11.280 --> 00:13:12.630 align:middle line:90%
and I wanted to know more.

00:13:12.630 --> 00:13:15.030 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: What was happening
with the cold laser

00:13:15.030 --> 00:13:16.155 align:middle line:90%
on the neurological system?

00:13:16.155 --> 00:13:20.220 align:middle line:84%
>>WORDEN: So Tiina Karu out of
Russia probably, to this point,

00:13:20.220 --> 00:13:24.150 align:middle line:84%
has still done the most studies
on cold laser frequencies.

00:13:24.150 --> 00:13:26.310 align:middle line:84%
And when we talk about
frequency medicine,

00:13:26.310 --> 00:13:28.350 align:middle line:84%
there's a lot of
devices out there.

00:13:28.350 --> 00:13:30.630 align:middle line:84%
I've worked with
the Russian device

00:13:30.630 --> 00:13:33.240 align:middle line:84%
SCENAR, the actual SCENAR
devices, that was developed

00:13:33.240 --> 00:13:34.680 align:middle line:90%
for their Russian technology.

00:13:34.680 --> 00:13:36.210 align:middle line:84%
I've lectured on
that, done that.

00:13:36.210 --> 00:13:39.280 align:middle line:84%
There are other
knock-offs of that.

00:13:39.280 --> 00:13:41.820 align:middle line:84%
There are many devices
that can be helpful.

00:13:41.820 --> 00:13:44.190 align:middle line:84%
But the most studies
that we have to date

00:13:44.190 --> 00:13:46.740 align:middle line:90%
have been done on cold lasers.

00:13:46.740 --> 00:13:47.610 align:middle line:90%
On frequency.

00:13:47.610 --> 00:13:49.560 align:middle line:84%
And we're looking at the
specific frequencies,

00:13:49.560 --> 00:13:50.670 align:middle line:90%
and what they do.

00:13:50.670 --> 00:13:52.800 align:middle line:84%
Some we know, some
we do not know.

00:13:52.800 --> 00:13:55.140 align:middle line:84%
And in the world
of energy medicine,

00:13:55.140 --> 00:13:57.420 align:middle line:90%
there's a lot of urban legend.

00:13:57.420 --> 00:14:00.440 align:middle line:84%
Let's use this frequency
for this, and this for that.

00:14:00.440 --> 00:14:01.252 align:middle line:90%
And I've looked.

00:14:01.252 --> 00:14:03.210 align:middle line:84%
And I've said, well,
where is that coming from?

00:14:03.210 --> 00:14:05.640 align:middle line:84%
Do we really have any
knowledge on that?

00:14:05.640 --> 00:14:06.690 align:middle line:90%
Some of it we do.

00:14:06.690 --> 00:14:09.570 align:middle line:84%
We know 16 Hertz is
where muscle contracts.

00:14:09.570 --> 00:14:11.610 align:middle line:90%
We know what that does.

00:14:11.610 --> 00:14:13.100 align:middle line:90%
We know with PEMF--

00:14:13.100 --> 00:14:15.210 align:middle line:84%
that's a pulse
magnetic frequency--

00:14:15.210 --> 00:14:16.800 align:middle line:84%
that's used in
traditional medicine,

00:14:16.800 --> 00:14:18.970 align:middle line:84%
when we have bones that
aren't healing and coming

00:14:18.970 --> 00:14:19.770 align:middle line:90%
together again.

00:14:19.770 --> 00:14:21.690 align:middle line:90%
We know those frequencies.

00:14:21.690 --> 00:14:23.850 align:middle line:90%
We know those modalities.

00:14:23.850 --> 00:14:25.080 align:middle line:90%
So it's real.

00:14:25.080 --> 00:14:27.360 align:middle line:84%
We're not looking at it
in traditional medicine

00:14:27.360 --> 00:14:30.330 align:middle line:84%
as a technology to
use this medicine.

00:14:30.330 --> 00:14:31.710 align:middle line:90%
It's still diagnostic.

00:14:31.710 --> 00:14:33.440 align:middle line:90%
What do you think an MRI is?

00:14:33.440 --> 00:14:36.580 align:middle line:84%
It's looking at the magnetic
resonance of the body.

00:14:36.580 --> 00:14:39.840 align:middle line:84%
We're using frequency
medicine traditionally

00:14:39.840 --> 00:14:44.490 align:middle line:84%
to really diagnose, but very
few instances in treatment.

00:14:44.490 --> 00:14:48.450 align:middle line:84%
So I'm excited, being
able to have the exposure

00:14:48.450 --> 00:14:50.310 align:middle line:84%
that I do to many
of these devices,

00:14:50.310 --> 00:14:51.768 align:middle line:84%
and it's hard to
keep up with them.

00:14:51.768 --> 00:14:53.610 align:middle line:90%
There's a one every day.

00:14:53.610 --> 00:14:56.190 align:middle line:84%
So my first question is, do you
have any science or research,

00:14:56.190 --> 00:14:59.004 align:middle line:84%
or which technology are are
you kind of based off of?

00:14:59.004 --> 00:15:01.170 align:middle line:84%
So I at least have a starting
point to look at them.

00:15:01.170 --> 00:15:03.510 align:middle line:84%
But I will tell
you that the most--

00:15:03.510 --> 00:15:05.910 align:middle line:84%
and I'll use the word
miraculous, which is not

00:15:05.910 --> 00:15:07.800 align:middle line:84%
supposed to be said in
traditional medicine,

00:15:07.800 --> 00:15:09.330 align:middle line:90%
but I'm not traditional.

00:15:09.330 --> 00:15:10.440 align:middle line:90%
OK?

00:15:10.440 --> 00:15:12.600 align:middle line:84%
The most miraculous
recoveries and things

00:15:12.600 --> 00:15:15.390 align:middle line:84%
that I have seen in
instantaneous healings

00:15:15.390 --> 00:15:18.390 align:middle line:84%
have been happening
from frequency medicine

00:15:18.390 --> 00:15:19.470 align:middle line:90%
with patients.

00:15:19.470 --> 00:15:23.040 align:middle line:84%
That's the fastest medicine,
because it's instantaneous.

00:15:23.040 --> 00:15:25.950 align:middle line:90%
One cell talks to the whole.

00:15:25.950 --> 00:15:27.940 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And there was
that famous photograph

00:15:27.940 --> 00:15:31.540 align:middle line:84%
from the 1930s, with
a gentleman lined up

00:15:31.540 --> 00:15:35.140 align:middle line:84%
around a banquet table, Royal
Ramon Rife at the center of it,

00:15:35.140 --> 00:15:37.330 align:middle line:90%
saying, the end of cancer.

00:15:37.330 --> 00:15:40.300 align:middle line:84%
And he was having
miraculous results.

00:15:40.300 --> 00:15:42.850 align:middle line:84%
As a result of-- and we're
going to get into microscopy

00:15:42.850 --> 00:15:43.870 align:middle line:90%
in a little bit--

00:15:43.870 --> 00:15:47.470 align:middle line:84%
as a result of being able
to ascertain the frequency

00:15:47.470 --> 00:15:49.210 align:middle line:90%
range of given diseases.

00:15:49.210 --> 00:15:51.440 align:middle line:84%
But that was shut
down immediately.

00:15:51.440 --> 00:15:52.240 align:middle line:90%
>>WORDEN: Yes.

00:15:52.240 --> 00:15:55.150 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And that-- to me,
that was one of, I'd say,

00:15:55.150 --> 00:15:57.155 align:middle line:84%
the greatest crimes
in history, if we're

00:15:57.155 --> 00:15:59.530 align:middle line:84%
looking at total numbers of
death that have occurred that

00:15:59.530 --> 00:16:01.270 align:middle line:90%
could have been avoided.

00:16:01.270 --> 00:16:05.410 align:middle line:84%
>>WORDEN: And I will say that
Rife frequency medicine is

00:16:05.410 --> 00:16:07.540 align:middle line:84%
still-- in
traditional world, you

00:16:07.540 --> 00:16:11.110 align:middle line:84%
wouldn't be allowed to say,
or even be wanting to say,

00:16:11.110 --> 00:16:13.180 align:middle line:84%
that you are using
Rife frequencies.

00:16:13.180 --> 00:16:17.500 align:middle line:84%
That being said, cold laser
technologies, the cold lasers

00:16:17.500 --> 00:16:19.810 align:middle line:84%
that I particularly
work with, I can put

00:16:19.810 --> 00:16:21.790 align:middle line:90%
into the tenth decimal point.

00:16:21.790 --> 00:16:23.680 align:middle line:84%
Why do you think I
have the ability--

00:16:23.680 --> 00:16:26.050 align:middle line:84%
and those have been
built along the ability

00:16:26.050 --> 00:16:28.127 align:middle line:84%
to go to the tenth
decimal point?

00:16:28.127 --> 00:16:30.460 align:middle line:84%
It's because we can utilize
some of the frequencies that

00:16:30.460 --> 00:16:32.800 align:middle line:90%
have history behind it.

00:16:32.800 --> 00:16:36.010 align:middle line:84%
Not documented science
in traditional medicine

00:16:36.010 --> 00:16:38.950 align:middle line:84%
today, but have
history in healing.

00:16:38.950 --> 00:16:41.350 align:middle line:84%
And I personally have worked
with those, with patients,

00:16:41.350 --> 00:16:42.730 align:middle line:90%
and have had good--

00:16:42.730 --> 00:16:44.770 align:middle line:90%
great effect.

00:16:44.770 --> 00:16:46.510 align:middle line:84%
I'm not an expert
in Rife frequency,

00:16:46.510 --> 00:16:49.260 align:middle line:84%
but I utilize the frequencies,
is what I would say.

00:16:49.260 --> 00:16:50.340 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: And-- OK.

00:16:50.340 --> 00:16:52.090 align:middle line:84%
And this may or may
not make a difference,

00:16:52.090 --> 00:16:54.370 align:middle line:84%
but I do know the
individual that

00:16:54.370 --> 00:16:58.920 align:middle line:84%
has the original handwritten
notes of Rife in those books.

00:16:58.920 --> 00:17:01.990 align:middle line:84%
And with the original
frequencies for each disease.

00:17:01.990 --> 00:17:03.172 align:middle line:90%
And also the protocols.

00:17:03.172 --> 00:17:04.380 align:middle line:90%
How that was used in the day.

00:17:04.380 --> 00:17:05.530 align:middle line:84%
So I don't know if
that matters to you,

00:17:05.530 --> 00:17:06.905 align:middle line:84%
but I could put
you two together.

00:17:06.905 --> 00:17:09.490 align:middle line:84%
>>WORDEN: And I have three
sets of Rife frequencies.

00:17:09.490 --> 00:17:13.030 align:middle line:84%
One probably is from your group
that you're talking about.

00:17:13.030 --> 00:17:15.910 align:middle line:84%
And everybody says
they've got the one,

00:17:15.910 --> 00:17:17.589 align:middle line:84%
and I'm assuming,
because I know you

00:17:17.589 --> 00:17:19.339 align:middle line:84%
and how diligent you
are in your research,

00:17:19.339 --> 00:17:20.800 align:middle line:90%
that you've got the real deal.

00:17:20.800 --> 00:17:22.589 align:middle line:84%
I may have, and I'd
love to look at it.

00:17:22.589 --> 00:17:28.270 align:middle line:84%
I will say that not knowing
at this point in time,

00:17:28.270 --> 00:17:30.770 align:middle line:84%
before you were
talking to me about it,

00:17:30.770 --> 00:17:32.890 align:middle line:84%
I utilize all three,
because my machine can put

00:17:32.890 --> 00:17:34.210 align:middle line:90%
in four different pods at once.

00:17:34.210 --> 00:17:35.200 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: So we'll just do four.

00:17:35.200 --> 00:17:36.515 align:middle line:90%
>>WORDEN: I use three or four--

00:17:36.515 --> 00:17:36.790 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:17:36.790 --> 00:17:37.100 align:middle line:90%
There you go.

00:17:37.100 --> 00:17:39.100 align:middle line:84%
>>WORDEN: And I may have
your set, I don't know.

00:17:39.100 --> 00:17:41.260 align:middle line:84%
But I will tell you that
I've had some things that

00:17:41.260 --> 00:17:43.540 align:middle line:84%
should not, in
traditional medicine

00:17:43.540 --> 00:17:48.040 align:middle line:84%
and in my head, when I started
working with it 15 years ago,

00:17:48.040 --> 00:17:49.750 align:middle line:84%
saying, I don't
see how that could

00:17:49.750 --> 00:17:51.620 align:middle line:90%
have happened this quickly.

00:17:51.620 --> 00:17:54.790 align:middle line:84%
Neurological damage,
a spinal canal

00:17:54.790 --> 00:17:57.340 align:middle line:84%
that had been damaged
and mechanically,

00:17:57.340 --> 00:18:00.940 align:middle line:84%
structurally, was crushed,
and could not conduct.

00:18:00.940 --> 00:18:02.440 align:middle line:84%
Now, we all know
plasticity, where

00:18:02.440 --> 00:18:05.020 align:middle line:84%
the body can find a
different way to map around,

00:18:05.020 --> 00:18:06.560 align:middle line:90%
and different ways to do that.

00:18:06.560 --> 00:18:07.880 align:middle line:90%
But that takes time.

00:18:07.880 --> 00:18:08.860 align:middle line:90%
You have to teach it.

00:18:08.860 --> 00:18:12.760 align:middle line:84%
You have to show the
brain where this is going.

00:18:12.760 --> 00:18:15.250 align:middle line:84%
To have something happen
with that kind of damage,

00:18:15.250 --> 00:18:19.660 align:middle line:84%
that mechanically I couldn't get
my head around how that body--

00:18:19.660 --> 00:18:22.930 align:middle line:84%
and this World War II vet is
a great example, named Leo--

00:18:22.930 --> 00:18:25.870 align:middle line:84%
came in, could not walk,
had severe bilateral pain

00:18:25.870 --> 00:18:26.920 align:middle line:90%
in both legs.

00:18:26.920 --> 00:18:29.270 align:middle line:84%
One treatment, and
got up and walked.

00:18:29.270 --> 00:18:32.680 align:middle line:84%
And I thought, OK, this is
a great example of placebo,

00:18:32.680 --> 00:18:34.480 align:middle line:84%
but I'm still
thinking, mechanically,

00:18:34.480 --> 00:18:37.060 align:middle line:90%
how is he doing this?

00:18:37.060 --> 00:18:38.672 align:middle line:84%
And he came back
three months later,

00:18:38.672 --> 00:18:41.130 align:middle line:84%
and I thought, wow, if he got
out of pain for three months,

00:18:41.130 --> 00:18:41.930 align:middle line:90%
this is my--

00:18:41.930 --> 00:18:43.990 align:middle line:84%
he said no, no, I'm
not back here for that.

00:18:43.990 --> 00:18:45.640 align:middle line:84%
I hurt myself in
my machine shop.

00:18:45.640 --> 00:18:47.830 align:middle line:84%
I want you to get that
Russian thing on me again.

00:18:47.830 --> 00:18:52.240 align:middle line:84%
And it was just
an example of how

00:18:52.240 --> 00:18:55.150 align:middle line:90%
miraculous the human body is.

00:18:55.150 --> 00:18:57.130 align:middle line:84%
If it has the right
signal in the right place

00:18:57.130 --> 00:19:00.610 align:middle line:84%
at the right time, it
can fix most anything.

00:19:00.610 --> 00:19:05.020 align:middle line:84%
Even if we, knowing what we know
about the human physical body,

00:19:05.020 --> 00:19:06.880 align:middle line:84%
can't get our head
wrapped around it.

00:19:06.880 --> 00:19:09.310 align:middle line:84%
And I've seen that
over and over again.

00:19:09.310 --> 00:19:11.014 align:middle line:90%
There's times that it doesn't.

00:19:11.014 --> 00:19:12.430 align:middle line:84%
And there's all
kinds of obstacles

00:19:12.430 --> 00:19:13.810 align:middle line:90%
that can come in there.

00:19:13.810 --> 00:19:16.600 align:middle line:90%
But I love energy medicine.

00:19:16.600 --> 00:19:18.780 align:middle line:90%
So it's the wave of the future.

00:19:18.780 --> 00:19:20.510 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Definitely.

00:19:20.510 --> 00:19:22.010 align:middle line:84%
And it was used in
the ancient past.

00:19:22.010 --> 00:19:23.740 align:middle line:84%
The didn't have
those, maybe some

00:19:23.740 --> 00:19:25.270 align:middle line:90%
of those electronic devices.

00:19:25.270 --> 00:19:26.740 align:middle line:84%
But it was well-known,
it was well

00:19:26.740 --> 00:19:28.720 align:middle line:84%
utilized through
simply light and color.

00:19:28.720 --> 00:19:29.650 align:middle line:90%
Through sunshine.

00:19:29.650 --> 00:19:30.020 align:middle line:90%
>>WORDEN: That's right.

00:19:30.020 --> 00:19:31.478 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And so
what we're looking

00:19:31.478 --> 00:19:34.510 align:middle line:84%
at, it sounds like, is a means
of carrying information--

00:19:34.510 --> 00:19:37.300 align:middle line:84%
and everything is
information, right?

00:19:37.300 --> 00:19:38.680 align:middle line:90%
To the cells of the body--

00:19:38.680 --> 00:19:39.700 align:middle line:90%
>>WORDEN: That's right.

00:19:39.700 --> 00:19:41.533 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: --in a way
that has no resistance.

00:19:41.533 --> 00:19:45.190 align:middle line:84%
Unlike taking a drug that has to
go through the digestive system

00:19:45.190 --> 00:19:46.700 align:middle line:90%
and be interpreted.

00:19:46.700 --> 00:19:48.100 align:middle line:90%
Can you explain that to us?

00:19:48.100 --> 00:19:49.600 align:middle line:84%
>>WORDEN: It's an
immediate cascade.

00:19:49.600 --> 00:19:51.340 align:middle line:84%
So if we look at the
pyramids and all,

00:19:51.340 --> 00:19:53.800 align:middle line:84%
when that light was hitting
and refracting, that's a laser.

00:19:53.800 --> 00:19:55.240 align:middle line:90%
That is what it is.

00:19:55.240 --> 00:19:56.050 align:middle line:90%
That's a laser.

00:19:56.050 --> 00:19:58.383 align:middle line:84%
It's refracting that light
to get to a certain frequency

00:19:58.383 --> 00:20:00.225 align:middle line:90%
so it can get to the human body.

00:20:00.225 --> 00:20:02.350 align:middle line:84%
And you were told to stand
at a certain time of day

00:20:02.350 --> 00:20:05.090 align:middle line:84%
and let it hit you right
here for this issue.

00:20:05.090 --> 00:20:06.340 align:middle line:90%
That's what we're doing today.

00:20:06.340 --> 00:20:07.881 align:middle line:84%
You don't have to
go to the pyramids.

00:20:07.881 --> 00:20:10.930 align:middle line:84%
We've got it in devices
that we can utilize.

00:20:10.930 --> 00:20:14.889 align:middle line:84%
Again, I will caution that I
think there's a lot out there

00:20:14.889 --> 00:20:16.180 align:middle line:90%
that-- we've got to be careful.

00:20:16.180 --> 00:20:16.810 align:middle line:90%
Claims that are being made--

00:20:16.810 --> 00:20:17.670 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: We're going
to talk about this.

00:20:17.670 --> 00:20:18.690 align:middle line:90%
>>WORDEN: Yeah.

00:20:18.690 --> 00:20:22.330 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And we'll talk about
the various kinds of devices,

00:20:22.330 --> 00:20:24.010 align:middle line:90%
laser devices.

00:20:24.010 --> 00:20:27.890 align:middle line:84%
And one thing you're
really cautionary about

00:20:27.890 --> 00:20:32.930 align:middle line:84%
is not using these technologies
that tend to kill the cells,

00:20:32.930 --> 00:20:35.930 align:middle line:84%
while it's giving
its supposed effect.

00:20:35.930 --> 00:20:39.260 align:middle line:84%
So I want to launch in
and explain in detail

00:20:39.260 --> 00:20:41.570 align:middle line:84%
some of the technologies
we're talking about.

00:20:41.570 --> 00:20:43.310 align:middle line:84%
What it's actually
doing to the cells,

00:20:43.310 --> 00:20:45.200 align:middle line:84%
and where the problem with
that actually comes in.

00:20:45.200 --> 00:20:46.820 align:middle line:84%
Because some people would
say, well, I got the effect.

00:20:46.820 --> 00:20:48.330 align:middle line:84%
I don't care if
the cells are dead.

00:20:48.330 --> 00:20:50.089 align:middle line:90%
So let's launch in.

00:20:50.089 --> 00:20:52.130 align:middle line:84%
>>WORDEN: So you know,
there are lots of devices.

00:20:52.130 --> 00:20:53.360 align:middle line:84%
Let's stick with
laser for a minute,

00:20:53.360 --> 00:20:54.680 align:middle line:84%
because it's a good
teaching point.

00:20:54.680 --> 00:20:54.860 align:middle line:90%
Right?

00:20:54.860 --> 00:20:57.170 align:middle line:84%
There is hot lasers, and
then there's cold lasers.

00:20:57.170 --> 00:20:59.330 align:middle line:84%
Hot lasers have their
place for surgery.

00:20:59.330 --> 00:21:01.250 align:middle line:84%
You'd rather, most
of the time, have

00:21:01.250 --> 00:21:03.230 align:middle line:90%
a hot laser than a scalpel.

00:21:03.230 --> 00:21:04.790 align:middle line:90%
It heals better and faster.

00:21:04.790 --> 00:21:07.760 align:middle line:84%
It's still destroying tissue,
but it has a purpose, right?

00:21:07.760 --> 00:21:11.900 align:middle line:84%
There are hot technologies that
are being used aesthetically,

00:21:11.900 --> 00:21:14.160 align:middle line:84%
and that's to destroy,
let's say, a fat cell.

00:21:14.160 --> 00:21:17.089 align:middle line:84%
So these body contouring
systems that are out there.

00:21:17.089 --> 00:21:18.380 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: What are they called?

00:21:18.380 --> 00:21:19.220 align:middle line:90%
I mean, what are--

00:21:19.220 --> 00:21:20.386 align:middle line:90%
>>WORDEN: There's all kinds.

00:21:20.386 --> 00:21:24.080 align:middle line:84%
But the radio frequency
creates heat in the tissue

00:21:24.080 --> 00:21:26.120 align:middle line:90%
and destroys fat cells.

00:21:26.120 --> 00:21:31.140 align:middle line:84%
And cool therapies freeze the
cell and destroy the fat cells.

00:21:31.140 --> 00:21:32.390 align:middle line:90%
And you may say, that's great.

00:21:32.390 --> 00:21:35.240 align:middle line:84%
I want to get rid of
this fat cell pocket.

00:21:35.240 --> 00:21:37.790 align:middle line:84%
Fat cells are part of
your endocrine system.

00:21:37.790 --> 00:21:38.720 align:middle line:90%
Your hormone system.

00:21:38.720 --> 00:21:40.670 align:middle line:84%
They're important
signaling molecules.

00:21:40.670 --> 00:21:44.930 align:middle line:84%
For leptin, telling your body
whether to store fat or not.

00:21:44.930 --> 00:21:48.120 align:middle line:84%
Telling you whether I'm
hungry, I'm not hungry.

00:21:48.120 --> 00:21:50.120 align:middle line:84%
Our endocrine, our hormones,
are very important.

00:21:50.120 --> 00:21:52.130 align:middle line:90%
Very powerful molecules.

00:21:52.130 --> 00:21:56.060 align:middle line:84%
I don't like any therapy
that destroys any cells.

00:21:56.060 --> 00:22:00.140 align:middle line:84%
There are new technologies, like
a green laser, a cold laser--

00:22:00.140 --> 00:22:03.320 align:middle line:84%
doesn't create any heat,
doesn't cold or hot

00:22:03.320 --> 00:22:06.350 align:middle line:84%
destroy any tissues,
and it temporarily

00:22:06.350 --> 00:22:07.640 align:middle line:90%
opens up the adipose site.

00:22:07.640 --> 00:22:09.080 align:middle line:90%
That's the fat cell.

00:22:09.080 --> 00:22:10.220 align:middle line:90%
Opens up that membrane.

00:22:10.220 --> 00:22:11.120 align:middle line:90%
The excess fat.

00:22:11.120 --> 00:22:14.520 align:middle line:84%
Like, it used to be this
big when we were 16.

00:22:14.520 --> 00:22:16.054 align:middle line:90%
And now, they're this big.

00:22:16.054 --> 00:22:17.220 align:middle line:90%
In areas we don't want them.

00:22:17.220 --> 00:22:18.428 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: They're like ticks.

00:22:18.428 --> 00:22:19.810 align:middle line:90%
They just kind of plump up.

00:22:19.810 --> 00:22:21.769 align:middle line:84%
>>WORDEN: I wish you
could just pull them off.

00:22:21.769 --> 00:22:23.310 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So they
plump up over time.

00:22:23.310 --> 00:22:24.220 align:middle line:84%
>>WORDEN: They
plump up over time.

00:22:24.220 --> 00:22:26.420 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Don't they also
plump up with toxins?

00:22:26.420 --> 00:22:27.380 align:middle line:90%
>>WORDEN: Yes, they do.

00:22:27.380 --> 00:22:29.940 align:middle line:84%
They also plump up and cause
their own-- especially visceral

00:22:29.940 --> 00:22:30.740 align:middle line:90%
fat.

00:22:30.740 --> 00:22:32.360 align:middle line:84%
That's the fat
around the organs.

00:22:32.360 --> 00:22:34.910 align:middle line:84%
That's that hard fat
that's not pinchable.

00:22:34.910 --> 00:22:37.130 align:middle line:84%
The man with the beer
belly, that has this.

00:22:37.130 --> 00:22:40.160 align:middle line:84%
That's the most
dangerous fat there is.

00:22:40.160 --> 00:22:42.140 align:middle line:84%
That in itself
causes inflammation.

00:22:42.140 --> 00:22:45.510 align:middle line:84%
That type of fat causes
inflammation in our body.

00:22:45.510 --> 00:22:47.510 align:middle line:84%
And we all know
inflammation is the root

00:22:47.510 --> 00:22:49.400 align:middle line:84%
of every chronic
degenerative disease

00:22:49.400 --> 00:22:50.840 align:middle line:90%
that we're talking about.

00:22:50.840 --> 00:22:54.560 align:middle line:84%
So when we're working
with frequency medicine,

00:22:54.560 --> 00:22:56.900 align:middle line:84%
to be able to open up
that, let it leak out

00:22:56.900 --> 00:23:00.500 align:middle line:84%
some of that excess fat, comes
back to normal function, if not

00:23:00.500 --> 00:23:01.430 align:middle line:90%
better function.

00:23:01.430 --> 00:23:04.160 align:middle line:84%
So it's better
metabolically active.

00:23:04.160 --> 00:23:05.180 align:middle line:90%
How do I know that?

00:23:05.180 --> 00:23:06.050 align:middle line:90%
I'm measuring it.

00:23:06.050 --> 00:23:09.050 align:middle line:84%
I'm looking at body
composition analysis,

00:23:09.050 --> 00:23:10.580 align:middle line:84%
looking at phase
contrast, and I'm

00:23:10.580 --> 00:23:13.329 align:middle line:84%
seeing, when somebody's
losing a spot, or a fat,

00:23:13.329 --> 00:23:14.870 align:middle line:84%
or a cellular-- what
are they losing?

00:23:14.870 --> 00:23:17.780 align:middle line:84%
If it's water, it's just
another fad diet, which

00:23:17.780 --> 00:23:19.670 align:middle line:90%
is detrimental in the long run.

00:23:19.670 --> 00:23:22.370 align:middle line:90%
No, what they're losing is fat.

00:23:22.370 --> 00:23:24.740 align:middle line:84%
And we can document that
it was fat that they lost.

00:23:24.740 --> 00:23:25.860 align:middle line:90%
Not water, not muscle.

00:23:25.860 --> 00:23:26.660 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: OK.

00:23:26.660 --> 00:23:30.790 align:middle line:84%
So let's say your fat cells
have plumped up, right?

00:23:30.790 --> 00:23:33.110 align:middle line:84%
And now you want to
use, say, green--

00:23:33.110 --> 00:23:35.360 align:middle line:84%
because the green laser is
what you really are behind.

00:23:35.360 --> 00:23:36.260 align:middle line:90%
>>WORDEN: That is.

00:23:36.260 --> 00:23:39.110 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So you're using green
laser to help open up the cell

00:23:39.110 --> 00:23:41.150 align:middle line:84%
and dump the
contents of the cell.

00:23:41.150 --> 00:23:43.670 align:middle line:84%
Does it completely
collapse the fat cell?

00:23:43.670 --> 00:23:46.510 align:middle line:84%
Or is it dumping toxins and
things that aren't fat out

00:23:46.510 --> 00:23:47.310 align:middle line:90%
of the cell?

00:23:47.310 --> 00:23:48.143 align:middle line:90%
What's it look like?

00:23:48.143 --> 00:23:51.260 align:middle line:84%
>>WORDEN: And so after the laser
treatment, immediately after,

00:23:51.260 --> 00:23:53.870 align:middle line:84%
there's a lymphatic program
that you have to do.

00:23:53.870 --> 00:23:54.710 align:middle line:90%
In that moment.

00:23:54.710 --> 00:23:56.835 align:middle line:84%
Because you've got to move
it out to the lymphatic.

00:23:56.835 --> 00:23:58.730 align:middle line:84%
So now that those
toxins and those things

00:23:58.730 --> 00:24:01.327 align:middle line:84%
can come out through
the bowel and the urine,

00:24:01.327 --> 00:24:02.660 align:middle line:90%
the places that we normally get.

00:24:02.660 --> 00:24:03.830 align:middle line:90%
And even sweat.

00:24:03.830 --> 00:24:05.210 align:middle line:90%
So it's a whole protocol.

00:24:05.210 --> 00:24:07.370 align:middle line:10%
It's not just throw the
laser on and you're done.

00:24:07.370 --> 00:24:08.170 align:middle line:10%
We want to make--

00:24:08.170 --> 00:24:10.970 align:middle line:10%
and if a person is toxic,
we will identify that first,

00:24:10.970 --> 00:24:13.550 align:middle line:10%
and maybe work on that before
we put them on the green laser.

00:24:13.550 --> 00:24:14.350 align:middle line:90%
Right?

00:24:14.350 --> 00:24:16.342 align:middle line:84%
So always, first
do no harm, always

00:24:16.342 --> 00:24:18.050 align:middle line:84%
let's do the right
thing for the patient.

00:24:18.050 --> 00:24:20.720 align:middle line:84%
And if there's a massive
amount of weight to be lost,

00:24:20.720 --> 00:24:23.750 align:middle line:84%
they're not a candidate for
these spot reduction things.

00:24:23.750 --> 00:24:26.914 align:middle line:84%
So this is for the person
who's doing things well,

00:24:26.914 --> 00:24:29.330 align:middle line:84%
and they've got a few little
spots that are bothering them

00:24:29.330 --> 00:24:31.784 align:middle line:90%
that just won't go away.

00:24:31.784 --> 00:24:34.200 align:middle line:84%
That's the perfect candidate
for these types of therapies.

00:24:34.200 --> 00:24:35.390 align:middle line:90%
Aesthetically.

00:24:35.390 --> 00:24:38.420 align:middle line:84%
Green laser also helps the
body build its own collagen.

00:24:38.420 --> 00:24:40.190 align:middle line:84%
That's why it's
working on cellulite.

00:24:40.190 --> 00:24:42.830 align:middle line:84%
That's why it's working
on tightening and firming.

00:24:42.830 --> 00:24:45.410 align:middle line:84%
So there's other techniques
and technologies that

00:24:45.410 --> 00:24:48.290 align:middle line:90%
do it, but at some expense.

00:24:48.290 --> 00:24:50.990 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Well, what is the
expense of losing those cells?

00:24:50.990 --> 00:24:53.510 align:middle line:84%
You're saying they're no longer
available for the endocrine

00:24:53.510 --> 00:24:54.800 align:middle line:90%
system to interface with?

00:24:54.800 --> 00:24:55.280 align:middle line:90%
>>WORDEN: Right.

00:24:55.280 --> 00:24:56.080 align:middle line:90%
Right.

00:24:56.080 --> 00:24:58.910 align:middle line:84%
And we also know that there
are more warnings happening

00:24:58.910 --> 00:25:02.210 align:middle line:84%
on both ends of the cold and
the hot types of therapies

00:25:02.210 --> 00:25:05.457 align:middle line:84%
from the FDA, because it's
leaving, just like liposuction

00:25:05.457 --> 00:25:07.040 align:middle line:84%
would do, instead
of a smooth surface,

00:25:07.040 --> 00:25:08.840 align:middle line:90%
it's leaving a dimpled surface.

00:25:08.840 --> 00:25:12.140 align:middle line:84%
That is because of
problems with the collagen,

00:25:12.140 --> 00:25:14.120 align:middle line:84%
but problems with the
way that the fat cells

00:25:14.120 --> 00:25:17.990 align:middle line:84%
are able to expand or
not expand appropriately.

00:25:17.990 --> 00:25:19.680 align:middle line:90%
So I think we'll learn more.

00:25:19.680 --> 00:25:21.830 align:middle line:84%
Everybody's wanting
to do something.

00:25:21.830 --> 00:25:22.820 align:middle line:90%
And they're jumping in.

00:25:22.820 --> 00:25:24.278 align:middle line:84%
But we're seeing
problems with some

00:25:24.278 --> 00:25:26.330 align:middle line:90%
of these aesthetic procedures.

00:25:26.330 --> 00:25:27.659 align:middle line:90%
Doing it that way.

00:25:27.659 --> 00:25:29.200 align:middle line:84%
I'm comfortable with
the green laser,

00:25:29.200 --> 00:25:31.450 align:middle line:84%
because I've worked with red
laser for pain management

00:25:31.450 --> 00:25:33.040 align:middle line:90%
for many, many years.

00:25:33.040 --> 00:25:34.335 align:middle line:90%
I know what wavelength it's in.

00:25:34.335 --> 00:25:40.240 align:middle line:84%
It's in a normal range that
it's not close to UV, or X-ray,

00:25:40.240 --> 00:25:43.999 align:middle line:84%
so we're in that close,
normal, healthier range.

00:25:43.999 --> 00:25:45.790 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And there
are a lot of-- like you

00:25:45.790 --> 00:25:48.460 align:middle line:84%
say, there's a new
technology coming out

00:25:48.460 --> 00:25:49.510 align:middle line:90%
by the week or month.

00:25:49.510 --> 00:25:50.950 align:middle line:90%
>>WORDEN: That's right.

00:25:50.950 --> 00:25:52.480 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And what about
some of that these, kind of,

00:25:52.480 --> 00:25:53.470 align:middle line:90%
home devices?

00:25:53.470 --> 00:25:56.650 align:middle line:84%
Like the home SCENAR,
for pain management?

00:25:56.650 --> 00:25:57.450 align:middle line:90%
>>WORDEN: Right.

00:25:57.450 --> 00:25:58.840 align:middle line:90%
It depends on the device.

00:25:58.840 --> 00:26:01.750 align:middle line:84%
If it's the actual technology,
those SCENAR devices--

00:26:01.750 --> 00:26:04.480 align:middle line:84%
and that's an acronym for a
Self-controlled Ergonomic--

00:26:04.480 --> 00:26:07.390 align:middle line:84%
I studied with the Russians, and
studied with the Australians.

00:26:07.390 --> 00:26:08.969 align:middle line:90%
They came to America--

00:26:08.969 --> 00:26:11.260 align:middle line:84%
a group that was trying to
bring that over from Russia.

00:26:11.260 --> 00:26:13.350 align:middle line:84%
They heard me lecturing
at an energy--

00:26:13.350 --> 00:26:15.849 align:middle line:84%
on an energy medicine
lecture in Florida.

00:26:15.849 --> 00:26:17.890 align:middle line:84%
Came to show me, and I
said, show me the science.

00:26:17.890 --> 00:26:19.750 align:middle line:84%
And they gave me all
this Russian research.

00:26:19.750 --> 00:26:22.690 align:middle line:84%
And I said, OK, translate
a few for me, would you?

00:26:22.690 --> 00:26:23.560 align:middle line:90%
And they did.

00:26:23.560 --> 00:26:26.260 align:middle line:84%
And that was the actual
device that, with Leo--

00:26:26.260 --> 00:26:28.840 align:middle line:84%
I was telling you the story
of the World War II vet--

00:26:28.840 --> 00:26:31.240 align:middle line:84%
I said, bring your best
practitioner to my clinic.

00:26:31.240 --> 00:26:32.722 align:middle line:90%
I'll give you my worst patients.

00:26:32.722 --> 00:26:34.930 align:middle line:84%
They are still my patients,
because I've helped them.

00:26:34.930 --> 00:26:36.110 align:middle line:90%
They're doing better.

00:26:36.110 --> 00:26:38.080 align:middle line:90%
But I can't get there.

00:26:38.080 --> 00:26:41.560 align:middle line:84%
And when I saw what that
particular device was

00:26:41.560 --> 00:26:44.890 align:middle line:84%
doing beyond what I was already
doing, and I said I'm in.

00:26:44.890 --> 00:26:45.820 align:middle line:90%
I want to learn.

00:26:45.820 --> 00:26:48.480 align:middle line:90%
So I like the SCENAR devices.

00:26:48.480 --> 00:26:50.890 align:middle line:84%
The professional devices
are very difficult to use.

00:26:50.890 --> 00:26:53.380 align:middle line:84%
It takes a lot of training,
lots of time and effort.

00:26:53.380 --> 00:26:55.120 align:middle line:84%
We have newer devices
that have come out,

00:26:55.120 --> 00:26:57.940 align:middle line:84%
I think that are
easier to utilize.

00:26:57.940 --> 00:26:59.220 align:middle line:90%
There's some out of Australia.

00:26:59.220 --> 00:27:00.740 align:middle line:90%
There's some others.

00:27:00.740 --> 00:27:05.950 align:middle line:84%
Most people now are teaching
it from a voltage standpoint.

00:27:05.950 --> 00:27:10.180 align:middle line:84%
If a cell does not have
an appropriate voltage--

00:27:10.180 --> 00:27:11.920 align:middle line:84%
like cancer cells
would be low voltage.

00:27:11.920 --> 00:27:13.040 align:middle line:90%
We can see it.

00:27:13.040 --> 00:27:16.420 align:middle line:84%
So I have patients that
have known cancerous tumors,

00:27:16.420 --> 00:27:20.960 align:middle line:84%
and I can see exactly where
it is without their MRIs

00:27:20.960 --> 00:27:21.760 align:middle line:90%
in front of me.

00:27:21.760 --> 00:27:23.410 align:middle line:84%
Which, of course, we
want that as well.

00:27:23.410 --> 00:27:24.550 align:middle line:90%
But I can see where it is.

00:27:24.550 --> 00:27:27.310 align:middle line:84%
And it showed me that
that's actually true.

00:27:27.310 --> 00:27:28.840 align:middle line:84%
My device will
show a low voltage

00:27:28.840 --> 00:27:30.640 align:middle line:84%
in all those areas
of dysfunction.

00:27:30.640 --> 00:27:32.630 align:middle line:84%
Doesn't mean it's cancer,
but if it is cancer,

00:27:32.630 --> 00:27:34.300 align:middle line:90%
it's definitely low voltage.

00:27:34.300 --> 00:27:37.540 align:middle line:84%
It's an easy way to teach
physicians and patients.

00:27:37.540 --> 00:27:40.000 align:middle line:84%
If it's low voltage, you
need to give it some energy

00:27:40.000 --> 00:27:42.370 align:middle line:84%
so that it can heal and
properly come back to function.

00:27:42.370 --> 00:27:43.990 align:middle line:84%
But if you're
dealing with cancer,

00:27:43.990 --> 00:27:46.871 align:middle line:84%
you need someone who knows
and understands the devices,

00:27:46.871 --> 00:27:48.120 align:middle line:90%
and knows how to utilize them.

00:27:48.120 --> 00:27:51.772 align:middle line:84%
Because is it possible, if
you have an active cancer,

00:27:51.772 --> 00:27:53.980 align:middle line:84%
that some of these devices
could help replicate that?

00:27:53.980 --> 00:27:55.300 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

00:27:55.300 --> 00:27:59.280 align:middle line:84%
So doing the home devices
with cancer, I'm wary of.

00:27:59.280 --> 00:28:00.655 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Yes, I
understand that.

00:28:00.655 --> 00:28:01.810 align:middle line:90%
>>WORDEN: Must know.

00:28:01.810 --> 00:28:05.110 align:middle line:84%
But I think that as we know
more and more about it,

00:28:05.110 --> 00:28:07.820 align:middle line:84%
it will become another one
of those great therapies

00:28:07.820 --> 00:28:08.620 align:middle line:90%
for cancer.

00:28:08.620 --> 00:28:09.080 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:28:09.080 --> 00:28:09.880 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

00:28:09.880 --> 00:28:12.070 align:middle line:84%
And I interviewed
Dr. Jerry Tennant.

00:28:12.070 --> 00:28:13.150 align:middle line:90%
"Healing Is Voltage."

00:28:13.150 --> 00:28:15.410 align:middle line:84%
>>WORDEN: And he's all about
teaching it by voltage.

00:28:15.410 --> 00:28:16.210 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: He is.

00:28:16.210 --> 00:28:18.750 align:middle line:90%


00:28:18.750 --> 00:28:21.030 align:middle line:84%
And I find that a very
practical way to look at it.

00:28:21.030 --> 00:28:21.830 align:middle line:90%
>>WORDEN: It is.

00:28:21.830 --> 00:28:23.110 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: The cell's
out of energy.

00:28:23.110 --> 00:28:23.710 align:middle line:90%
>>WORDEN: That's right.

00:28:23.710 --> 00:28:23.980 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right?

00:28:23.980 --> 00:28:26.438 align:middle line:84%
And very little healing can
happen if you're out of energy.

00:28:26.438 --> 00:28:28.860 align:middle line:90%
>>WORDEN: It is.

00:28:28.860 --> 00:28:30.160 align:middle line:90%
That is an easy way to teach.

00:28:30.160 --> 00:28:32.035 align:middle line:84%
And I agree with Jerry
Tennant, in that there

00:28:32.035 --> 00:28:34.060 align:middle line:84%
are many other
aspects besides that,

00:28:34.060 --> 00:28:36.090 align:middle line:84%
like the matrix that
I was talking about,

00:28:36.090 --> 00:28:39.310 align:middle line:84%
and many other ways, especially
with the cold lasers,

00:28:39.310 --> 00:28:41.880 align:middle line:84%
with really documented
science behind it.

00:28:41.880 --> 00:28:46.300 align:middle line:90%
So it's a new area, so to speak.

00:28:46.300 --> 00:28:49.340 align:middle line:84%
But it's an old area, as you
mentioned at the beginning.

00:28:49.340 --> 00:28:51.760 align:middle line:84%
We've been using energy
medicine for a long time.

00:28:51.760 --> 00:28:54.550 align:middle line:84%
Now we have unique
cool devices, but we

00:28:54.550 --> 00:28:57.110 align:middle line:84%
need to do the studies
on them to prove

00:28:57.110 --> 00:28:59.980 align:middle line:84%
that the claims that are being
made around them are accurate.

00:28:59.980 --> 00:29:00.820 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:29:00.820 --> 00:29:04.810 align:middle line:84%
So before we go to the
Konstantin Korotkov

00:29:04.810 --> 00:29:08.495 align:middle line:84%
technology, what about, just
let's go retro for a moment.

00:29:08.495 --> 00:29:10.120 align:middle line:84%
I mean, there have
always been healers.

00:29:10.120 --> 00:29:11.200 align:middle line:90%
Hands-on healers.

00:29:11.200 --> 00:29:15.140 align:middle line:84%
Let's talk about the biofield of
the human body, with intention,

00:29:15.140 --> 00:29:18.350 align:middle line:84%
and electricity and such, that
comes out of our hands alone.

00:29:18.350 --> 00:29:19.150 align:middle line:90%
>>WORDEN: Right.

00:29:19.150 --> 00:29:21.170 align:middle line:90%
So there are some studies.

00:29:21.170 --> 00:29:23.412 align:middle line:84%
One study in
particular is a group

00:29:23.412 --> 00:29:25.120 align:middle line:84%
of scientists that
said, if this is true,

00:29:25.120 --> 00:29:26.950 align:middle line:84%
if there's hands-on healing
and this is happening,

00:29:26.950 --> 00:29:28.460 align:middle line:90%
we should be able to measure it.

00:29:28.460 --> 00:29:29.260 align:middle line:90%
So they did.

00:29:29.260 --> 00:29:29.890 align:middle line:90%
And they measure.

00:29:29.890 --> 00:29:31.630 align:middle line:84%
They can measure a
frequency coming out

00:29:31.630 --> 00:29:33.010 align:middle line:90%
of the healer's hand.

00:29:33.010 --> 00:29:36.790 align:middle line:84%
And they can also measure that
the patient, the person sitting

00:29:36.790 --> 00:29:40.090 align:middle line:84%
in front of them, started in
training with that frequency.

00:29:40.090 --> 00:29:43.810 align:middle line:84%
So we know that entrainment
is, my heart will start beating

00:29:43.810 --> 00:29:45.160 align:middle line:90%
with your heart in time.

00:29:45.160 --> 00:29:46.810 align:middle line:90%
Something that we do well.

00:29:46.810 --> 00:29:48.370 align:middle line:84%
But they measured
those frequencies.

00:29:48.370 --> 00:29:52.452 align:middle line:84%
And that range of that
frequency was around 7.8 Hertz.

00:29:52.452 --> 00:29:54.160 align:middle line:84%
It was a little above
and a little below.

00:29:54.160 --> 00:29:55.720 align:middle line:90%
What is 7.8 Hertz?

00:29:55.720 --> 00:29:59.810 align:middle line:84%
It's the same frequency of the
earth's electromagnetic field.

00:29:59.810 --> 00:30:02.394 align:middle line:84%
So go outside, if you want the
cheapest, least expensive way--

00:30:02.394 --> 00:30:03.726 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Lay on the dirt, and--

00:30:03.726 --> 00:30:06.090 align:middle line:84%
>>WORDEN: Lay on-- take
your-- that's exactly right.

00:30:06.090 --> 00:30:10.930 align:middle line:84%
Take your shoes off, and
ground yourself with the Earth.

00:30:10.930 --> 00:30:14.560 align:middle line:84%
That is frequency
medicine right there.

00:30:14.560 --> 00:30:17.350 align:middle line:84%
So these hands-on
healers, they can do it.

00:30:17.350 --> 00:30:20.080 align:middle line:84%
But they found even the
experienced healers sometimes

00:30:20.080 --> 00:30:23.470 align:middle line:84%
would show some kind of
distress in their GI,

00:30:23.470 --> 00:30:25.899 align:middle line:84%
because it took so much
energy out of them.

00:30:25.899 --> 00:30:27.940 align:middle line:84%
And you'll hear that in
communities of the people

00:30:27.940 --> 00:30:29.360 align:middle line:90%
that work with this, right?

00:30:29.360 --> 00:30:30.160 align:middle line:90%
I get exhausted.

00:30:30.160 --> 00:30:31.090 align:middle line:90%
It drains me.

00:30:31.090 --> 00:30:32.560 align:middle line:90%
We've got to be careful.

00:30:32.560 --> 00:30:35.240 align:middle line:84%
We've got to be careful
if you're using that.

00:30:35.240 --> 00:30:37.060 align:middle line:84%
And not to say that
you completely shield,

00:30:37.060 --> 00:30:39.340 align:middle line:84%
but if you've got two
fairly healthy people

00:30:39.340 --> 00:30:41.200 align:middle line:84%
and you resonate
with one another,

00:30:41.200 --> 00:30:43.210 align:middle line:84%
the amplitude of
that healthy wave

00:30:43.210 --> 00:30:45.350 align:middle line:84%
is going to get
higher and higher.

00:30:45.350 --> 00:30:47.620 align:middle line:84%
But if we got somebody
who's very, very ill,

00:30:47.620 --> 00:30:49.794 align:middle line:84%
and their wave's down
here and yours is up here,

00:30:49.794 --> 00:30:51.460 align:middle line:84%
you're going to do
this, so that's going

00:30:51.460 --> 00:30:52.690 align:middle line:84%
to bring yours
down a little bit,

00:30:52.690 --> 00:30:53.920 align:middle line:90%
while you're bringing theirs up.

00:30:53.920 --> 00:30:55.961 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Along the line
of what you were talking

00:30:55.961 --> 00:30:58.540 align:middle line:84%
about a moment ago, get
your feet out on the dirt,

00:30:58.540 --> 00:31:01.720 align:middle line:84%
there was a book that I
just absolutely adored,

00:31:01.720 --> 00:31:04.030 align:middle line:84%
called "The Goat
Doctor of the Sierras."

00:31:04.030 --> 00:31:09.010 align:middle line:84%
And this man was raised
by a very eccentric woman

00:31:09.010 --> 00:31:12.950 align:middle line:84%
in San Francisco who understood
the human elements of energy

00:31:12.950 --> 00:31:13.750 align:middle line:90%
healing.

00:31:13.750 --> 00:31:18.670 align:middle line:84%
She took this boy who had
lost a lung, to tuberculosis,

00:31:18.670 --> 00:31:21.250 align:middle line:84%
I believe, took him
to the Sierra Nevada,

00:31:21.250 --> 00:31:24.980 align:middle line:84%
and he slept in a
hollowed-out bed of dirt.

00:31:24.980 --> 00:31:26.230 align:middle line:90%
I mean, that's where he slept.

00:31:26.230 --> 00:31:27.910 align:middle line:84%
He was surrounded by
animals, including

00:31:27.910 --> 00:31:31.240 align:middle line:84%
goats, who he developed a very
deep telepathic relationship

00:31:31.240 --> 00:31:32.680 align:middle line:90%
with on a healing level.

00:31:32.680 --> 00:31:35.110 align:middle line:84%
She's told him,
grow his hair long,

00:31:35.110 --> 00:31:37.210 align:middle line:84%
so it could then
start picking up

00:31:37.210 --> 00:31:38.740 align:middle line:90%
the subtle electrical forces.

00:31:38.740 --> 00:31:42.790 align:middle line:84%
And this young man, besides
being an extraordinary story,

00:31:42.790 --> 00:31:45.220 align:middle line:84%
this man developed
incredible healing abilities,

00:31:45.220 --> 00:31:46.900 align:middle line:84%
and literally,
people would line up

00:31:46.900 --> 00:31:50.770 align:middle line:84%
and come from all over the
US out in this remote area

00:31:50.770 --> 00:31:54.070 align:middle line:84%
of the Sierra, and wait for
days to have his hands on touch.

00:31:54.070 --> 00:31:56.990 align:middle line:84%
But that is how he
recovered his own health.

00:31:56.990 --> 00:31:57.940 align:middle line:90%
>>WORDEN: Right.

00:31:57.940 --> 00:31:59.830 align:middle line:84%
And I think we all
have that ability.

00:31:59.830 --> 00:32:02.080 align:middle line:84%
It's just how
often do we get out

00:32:02.080 --> 00:32:05.080 align:middle line:84%
of the fluorescent
lights and the cell

00:32:05.080 --> 00:32:08.200 align:middle line:84%
phones and this and that, all
the disturbances that we have,

00:32:08.200 --> 00:32:11.790 align:middle line:84%
to really connect with
nature and ourselves?

00:32:11.790 --> 00:32:14.050 align:middle line:84%
And we have the
ability, but we've

00:32:14.050 --> 00:32:16.872 align:middle line:84%
chosen to have more
technology than connecting.

00:32:16.872 --> 00:32:18.580 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Which is
the shame, than touch.

00:32:18.580 --> 00:32:19.960 align:middle line:90%
More technology than touch.

00:32:19.960 --> 00:32:23.020 align:middle line:84%
And it's how beautiful it would
be if, in our lives, we had,

00:32:23.020 --> 00:32:26.635 align:middle line:84%
whether it's a partner,
or friends, or kids,

00:32:26.635 --> 00:32:28.480 align:middle line:84%
whomever we're
comfortable with, to be

00:32:28.480 --> 00:32:32.425 align:middle line:84%
able to have a little laying on
of hands, day in and day out.

00:32:32.425 --> 00:32:34.309 align:middle line:90%
A little foot massage here.

00:32:34.309 --> 00:32:36.100 align:middle line:84%
>>WORDEN: And those
studies have been done.

00:32:36.100 --> 00:32:39.550 align:middle line:84%
The healing power of
touch, and just even a hug.

00:32:39.550 --> 00:32:44.160 align:middle line:84%
But I will say the good news is,
patients 10 years ago sitting--

00:32:44.160 --> 00:32:45.280 align:middle line:90%
and it's in my intake.

00:32:45.280 --> 00:32:47.037 align:middle line:84%
I'd ask, do you have
a spiritual practice?

00:32:47.037 --> 00:32:48.370 align:middle line:90%
I'm not ask if you go to church.

00:32:48.370 --> 00:32:49.620 align:middle line:90%
I'm not asking about religion.

00:32:49.620 --> 00:32:51.460 align:middle line:84%
I'm asking, do you
feel connected?

00:32:51.460 --> 00:32:52.376 align:middle line:90%
And emotionally.

00:32:52.376 --> 00:32:53.500 align:middle line:90%
And asking those questions.

00:32:53.500 --> 00:32:56.250 align:middle line:84%
It was always a little awkward
for them to talk about.

00:32:56.250 --> 00:32:58.960 align:middle line:84%
Now, it's like an
awakening is happening.

00:32:58.960 --> 00:33:01.690 align:middle line:84%
Patients are coming in and
they want to talk about it.

00:33:01.690 --> 00:33:03.340 align:middle line:84%
I had a contractor
the other day,

00:33:03.340 --> 00:33:06.380 align:middle line:84%
a 24-year-old, working
hard, young children,

00:33:06.380 --> 00:33:08.620 align:middle line:84%
contractor coming and
falling apart at the seams.

00:33:08.620 --> 00:33:10.480 align:middle line:84%
And I said, can you just
do some breathing with me?

00:33:10.480 --> 00:33:12.604 align:middle line:84%
And he said, well, you're
the only person I'd let--

00:33:12.604 --> 00:33:13.550 align:middle line:90%
I'd do this with.

00:33:13.550 --> 00:33:14.890 align:middle line:90%
You know, the tough guy to get.

00:33:14.890 --> 00:33:17.140 align:middle line:84%
He was sobbing at
the end, and then

00:33:17.140 --> 00:33:20.350 align:middle line:84%
now he comes by every so often
and says, you saved my life.

00:33:20.350 --> 00:33:21.550 align:middle line:90%
Something as simple as that.

00:33:21.550 --> 00:33:23.652 align:middle line:90%
People are wanting it.

00:33:23.652 --> 00:33:24.610 align:middle line:90%
They know they need it.

00:33:24.610 --> 00:33:27.490 align:middle line:84%
They just need to
have this opened up

00:33:27.490 --> 00:33:28.990 align:middle line:90%
to them to hear about it.

00:33:28.990 --> 00:33:30.740 align:middle line:90%
And that's the good news.

00:33:30.740 --> 00:33:33.370 align:middle line:84%
They're not as closed
off as they used to be.

00:33:33.370 --> 00:33:37.660 align:middle line:84%
People really are wanting to
touch, and hear, and feel,

00:33:37.660 --> 00:33:39.940 align:middle line:84%
and understand that the
Earth and nature are

00:33:39.940 --> 00:33:42.229 align:middle line:90%
some of our best healers.

00:33:42.229 --> 00:33:43.270 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: And each other.

00:33:43.270 --> 00:33:44.000 align:middle line:90%
>>WORDEN: That's right.

00:33:44.000 --> 00:33:45.000 align:middle line:90%
That's right.

00:33:45.000 --> 00:33:47.416 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Now, let's go back
into the world of technology,

00:33:47.416 --> 00:33:50.350 align:middle line:84%
away from touch for a moment to
technology, and this GDV device

00:33:50.350 --> 00:33:53.230 align:middle line:84%
that we talked about, that
centers are opening based

00:33:53.230 --> 00:33:56.830 align:middle line:84%
on this, which is measuring
not only the biofield,

00:33:56.830 --> 00:34:00.460 align:middle line:84%
but the chakra field, the
vitality of the organs,

00:34:00.460 --> 00:34:01.555 align:middle line:90%
the energy output.

00:34:01.555 --> 00:34:03.020 align:middle line:90%
Let's talk about it.

00:34:03.020 --> 00:34:04.720 align:middle line:84%
>>WORDEN: So all of
those technologies

00:34:04.720 --> 00:34:07.230 align:middle line:84%
are just giving us more
and more information.

00:34:07.230 --> 00:34:10.000 align:middle line:84%
We're not just trying to look
just at the physical body.

00:34:10.000 --> 00:34:12.850 align:middle line:84%
We're looking at the field
outside of the body, which,

00:34:12.850 --> 00:34:15.909 align:middle line:84%
even in traditional
physics world,

00:34:15.909 --> 00:34:18.250 align:middle line:84%
is known to be able
to be measured.

00:34:18.250 --> 00:34:19.945 align:middle line:90%
It's not woo, we can measure it.

00:34:19.945 --> 00:34:23.631 align:middle line:84%
It exists-- this electromagnetic
field around the body.

00:34:23.631 --> 00:34:25.630 align:middle line:84%
Now, if we're starting
to tap into the spiritual

00:34:25.630 --> 00:34:32.620 align:middle line:84%
or the esoteric type world, now
you're looking at the chakras.

00:34:32.620 --> 00:34:35.359 align:middle line:90%
Are those energy wheels?

00:34:35.359 --> 00:34:36.159 align:middle line:90%
What are they?

00:34:36.159 --> 00:34:37.086 align:middle line:90%
Can we measure them?

00:34:37.086 --> 00:34:38.710 align:middle line:84%
And these new
technologies are starting

00:34:38.710 --> 00:34:40.960 align:middle line:84%
to measure them,
and correlate what

00:34:40.960 --> 00:34:43.570 align:middle line:84%
they see clinically or
emotionally happening

00:34:43.570 --> 00:34:46.300 align:middle line:84%
with the person, and then
collecting the data, and going,

00:34:46.300 --> 00:34:48.219 align:middle line:90%
this is what this may look like.

00:34:48.219 --> 00:34:50.290 align:middle line:84%
And it's a matter of
experimenting to find out

00:34:50.290 --> 00:34:52.469 align:middle line:90%
what they really look like.

00:34:52.469 --> 00:34:54.040 align:middle line:84%
For thousands of
years we've known

00:34:54.040 --> 00:34:55.539 align:middle line:90%
about these energy centers.

00:34:55.539 --> 00:34:56.830 align:middle line:90%
Different ways to work with it.

00:34:56.830 --> 00:34:59.800 align:middle line:84%
But it's really interesting
and fun to be able to see it.

00:34:59.800 --> 00:35:04.000 align:middle line:84%
And it's powerful for people
to see, oh, that's me.

00:35:04.000 --> 00:35:05.940 align:middle line:90%
This one's out of balance on me.

00:35:05.940 --> 00:35:07.815 align:middle line:84%
Instead of someone
just saying I feel it.

00:35:07.815 --> 00:35:09.940 align:middle line:84%
I can feel the presence,
and you need to work here.

00:35:09.940 --> 00:35:11.710 align:middle line:84%
And they go, OK, I think
I want to believe that,

00:35:11.710 --> 00:35:12.510 align:middle line:90%
but I'm not sure.

00:35:12.510 --> 00:35:13.930 align:middle line:84%
When they see
something physical,

00:35:13.930 --> 00:35:16.480 align:middle line:84%
a print out or whatever,
from a technology,

00:35:16.480 --> 00:35:18.760 align:middle line:84%
they're more likely to
pay attention to it.

00:35:18.760 --> 00:35:19.560 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:35:19.560 --> 00:35:21.370 align:middle line:90%
And so it's really--

00:35:21.370 --> 00:35:23.470 align:middle line:90%
that is a diagnostic tool.

00:35:23.470 --> 00:35:25.892 align:middle line:84%
But then, what is used as
its complement after that?

00:35:25.892 --> 00:35:26.850 align:middle line:90%
>>WORDEN: That's right.

00:35:26.850 --> 00:35:30.090 align:middle line:84%
So any-- a lot of the
devices will either

00:35:30.090 --> 00:35:33.540 align:middle line:84%
put back in, appropriately,
a frequency, or something

00:35:33.540 --> 00:35:36.840 align:middle line:90%
that the technology deems.

00:35:36.840 --> 00:35:39.010 align:middle line:84%
I've had a problem with
a lot of the technology

00:35:39.010 --> 00:35:41.850 align:middle line:84%
so far, because it's still
a software written by a man.

00:35:41.850 --> 00:35:45.750 align:middle line:84%
Somebody had to decide that
when the machine reads this,

00:35:45.750 --> 00:35:49.800 align:middle line:84%
this is what that means, and let
me put this frequency back in.

00:35:49.800 --> 00:35:53.980 align:middle line:84%
I was not ready to give up
my diagnostic as a human

00:35:53.980 --> 00:35:54.780 align:middle line:90%
to a machine.

00:35:54.780 --> 00:35:59.910 align:middle line:84%
But it is worthwhile information
to take, and say, I agree.

00:35:59.910 --> 00:36:02.490 align:middle line:84%
This looks like exactly
what I'm looking at.

00:36:02.490 --> 00:36:04.560 align:middle line:84%
And I think we're getting
better and better.

00:36:04.560 --> 00:36:06.810 align:middle line:84%
And these newer
technologies are getting

00:36:06.810 --> 00:36:10.830 align:middle line:84%
more and more precise in being
able to see and understand

00:36:10.830 --> 00:36:14.190 align:middle line:84%
that if I have this wave
and it needs to be here,

00:36:14.190 --> 00:36:17.040 align:middle line:84%
I know how to do that
and what it looks like.

00:36:17.040 --> 00:36:19.410 align:middle line:84%
But they are still
technology, and they are still

00:36:19.410 --> 00:36:21.637 align:middle line:84%
written and designed
and put together by--

00:36:21.637 --> 00:36:22.470 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: By people.

00:36:22.470 --> 00:36:25.065 align:middle line:90%
>>WORDEN: By people.

00:36:25.065 --> 00:36:27.810 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Well, I was going to
say, back in the day, again,

00:36:27.810 --> 00:36:31.290 align:middle line:84%
going back to Rife, the beauty
of that day was the microscope.

00:36:31.290 --> 00:36:32.760 align:middle line:84%
The universal
microscope, which was

00:36:32.760 --> 00:36:36.330 align:middle line:84%
able to see full energetic
spectrums which reflected

00:36:36.330 --> 00:36:39.330 align:middle line:84%
color ranges and such, so you
could tell the frequency range

00:36:39.330 --> 00:36:40.715 align:middle line:90%
of whatever the condition was.

00:36:40.715 --> 00:36:41.515 align:middle line:90%
Right?

00:36:41.515 --> 00:36:42.315 align:middle line:90%
>>WORDEN: Right.

00:36:42.315 --> 00:36:44.250 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: And then apply--

00:36:44.250 --> 00:36:46.980 align:middle line:84%
and his notes were
written based on that,

00:36:46.980 --> 00:36:49.290 align:middle line:84%
in terms of what should be
applied back into the body.

00:36:49.290 --> 00:36:50.610 align:middle line:90%
Into the cells.

00:36:50.610 --> 00:36:54.120 align:middle line:84%
So that microscope
was confiscated,

00:36:54.120 --> 00:36:56.190 align:middle line:84%
and many things
happened to that.

00:36:56.190 --> 00:36:58.080 align:middle line:84%
There have been some
other interesting ones.

00:36:58.080 --> 00:37:00.500 align:middle line:84%
You know of some that are
under development now.

00:37:00.500 --> 00:37:00.610 align:middle line:90%
>>WORDEN: Right.

00:37:00.610 --> 00:37:01.530 align:middle line:90%
Right.

00:37:01.530 --> 00:37:05.280 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Is it important
that the field of microscopy

00:37:05.280 --> 00:37:10.980 align:middle line:84%
reintroduce these technologies
for people like you to see--

00:37:10.980 --> 00:37:14.040 align:middle line:84%
to understand which
frequencies are working now?

00:37:14.040 --> 00:37:16.750 align:middle line:84%
>>WORDEN: I think it helps
open it up to the masses.

00:37:16.750 --> 00:37:20.730 align:middle line:84%
It helps open up the
field to more people,

00:37:20.730 --> 00:37:23.460 align:middle line:84%
to think that there's
a reality there.

00:37:23.460 --> 00:37:24.780 align:middle line:90%
That's what I think.

00:37:24.780 --> 00:37:27.600 align:middle line:84%
Is that there's still a lot
of, well, you can't prove it.

00:37:27.600 --> 00:37:28.780 align:middle line:90%
Show me the data.

00:37:28.780 --> 00:37:29.910 align:middle line:90%
Where is the information?

00:37:29.910 --> 00:37:34.230 align:middle line:84%
This is all a bunch
of urban legend.

00:37:34.230 --> 00:37:37.830 align:middle line:84%
So the more data we have,
the more ways of looking--

00:37:37.830 --> 00:37:41.159 align:middle line:84%
either a microscope, or being
able to measure with devices

00:37:41.159 --> 00:37:43.200 align:middle line:84%
that measure the field,
the electromagnetic field

00:37:43.200 --> 00:37:44.250 align:middle line:90%
around the body.

00:37:44.250 --> 00:37:46.470 align:middle line:84%
Being able to have
people like Bill Tiller

00:37:46.470 --> 00:37:48.990 align:middle line:84%
put together a
mathematical equation

00:37:48.990 --> 00:37:52.140 align:middle line:84%
to prove that intention can
be measured, and prove it

00:37:52.140 --> 00:37:53.370 align:middle line:90%
across the world.

00:37:53.370 --> 00:37:55.830 align:middle line:84%
And by the way, Bill is--
if I have a mentor, that's

00:37:55.830 --> 00:38:00.330 align:middle line:84%
who my mentor is, in frequency
and energetic medicine is Bill.

00:38:00.330 --> 00:38:02.100 align:middle line:90%
And he's a true scientist.

00:38:02.100 --> 00:38:03.060 align:middle line:90%
A true scientist.

00:38:03.060 --> 00:38:04.890 align:middle line:84%
You know, he is still
emeritus professor

00:38:04.890 --> 00:38:07.110 align:middle line:90%
in physics at Stanford.

00:38:07.110 --> 00:38:09.930 align:middle line:84%
So, you know, he really
wants to show the science,

00:38:09.930 --> 00:38:13.770 align:middle line:84%
because he understands
that to get more people

00:38:13.770 --> 00:38:15.690 align:middle line:84%
to understand and
to help more people,

00:38:15.690 --> 00:38:18.750 align:middle line:84%
we need to be able to get some
more quantification behind some

00:38:18.750 --> 00:38:20.200 align:middle line:84%
of these things
that we know work.

00:38:20.200 --> 00:38:21.000 align:middle line:90%
We know.

00:38:21.000 --> 00:38:23.280 align:middle line:84%
We know what this
is doing right here.

00:38:23.280 --> 00:38:25.800 align:middle line:84%
We know that it absorbs
energy at a [INAUDIBLE].

00:38:25.800 --> 00:38:28.500 align:middle line:84%
But how do we measure it, and
how do we really get it out

00:38:28.500 --> 00:38:28.830 align:middle line:90%
to the masses?

00:38:28.830 --> 00:38:30.450 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Which is the only way
it's going to go to the masses.

00:38:30.450 --> 00:38:31.320 align:middle line:90%
>>WORDEN: That's right.

00:38:31.320 --> 00:38:32.653 align:middle line:90%
And we are about helping people.

00:38:32.653 --> 00:38:33.840 align:middle line:90%
So let's do the research.

00:38:33.840 --> 00:38:34.790 align:middle line:90%
Let's do more.

00:38:34.790 --> 00:38:36.540 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: OK, and I
have another question,

00:38:36.540 --> 00:38:38.580 align:middle line:84%
because you have
experience in this area.

00:38:38.580 --> 00:38:43.980 align:middle line:84%
And that is, is it possible that
various diseases, since Rife

00:38:43.980 --> 00:38:46.440 align:middle line:84%
put his notes together
in the '20s and '30s,

00:38:46.440 --> 00:38:49.140 align:middle line:84%
that since then,
they have actually

00:38:49.140 --> 00:38:50.940 align:middle line:84%
shifted in their
own frequency range

00:38:50.940 --> 00:38:53.910 align:middle line:84%
as a result of our interface
with RF frequencies,

00:38:53.910 --> 00:38:56.580 align:middle line:84%
EMF frequencies, et
cetera, et cetera.

00:38:56.580 --> 00:38:58.170 align:middle line:90%
Things have to be mutating.

00:38:58.170 --> 00:39:01.230 align:middle line:84%
So those notes may
not hold today.

00:39:01.230 --> 00:39:04.890 align:middle line:84%
We would have to do
this research again.

00:39:04.890 --> 00:39:06.150 align:middle line:90%
>>WORDEN: And that's a great--

00:39:06.150 --> 00:39:07.050 align:middle line:90%
great way of looking.

00:39:07.050 --> 00:39:08.850 align:middle line:84%
And that's why it comes
to the individual,

00:39:08.850 --> 00:39:10.890 align:middle line:84%
and being able to
individually measure someone

00:39:10.890 --> 00:39:11.970 align:middle line:90%
at these levels.

00:39:11.970 --> 00:39:13.590 align:middle line:90%
And where are they right now?

00:39:13.590 --> 00:39:15.960 align:middle line:84%
And where do we think
that they need to go?

00:39:15.960 --> 00:39:18.040 align:middle line:84%
And so even the earth's
electromagnetic field

00:39:18.040 --> 00:39:18.840 align:middle line:90%
has raised.

00:39:18.840 --> 00:39:19.640 align:middle line:90%
It was 7.8.

00:39:19.640 --> 00:39:21.600 align:middle line:84%
It was in a range,
but around 7.8.

00:39:21.600 --> 00:39:22.990 align:middle line:90%
That has risen.

00:39:22.990 --> 00:39:23.790 align:middle line:90%
That has risen.

00:39:23.790 --> 00:39:26.142 align:middle line:84%
So if the Earth's
magnetic field has risen,

00:39:26.142 --> 00:39:27.600 align:middle line:84%
how could that not
be affecting us?

00:39:27.600 --> 00:39:28.800 align:middle line:90%
Of course it is.

00:39:28.800 --> 00:39:32.610 align:middle line:84%
So we're looking for,
what kinds of technologies

00:39:32.610 --> 00:39:35.910 align:middle line:84%
can we come up with to be
able to look at an individual

00:39:35.910 --> 00:39:37.560 align:middle line:84%
and see where are
you out of balance?

00:39:37.560 --> 00:39:41.280 align:middle line:84%
And instead of individual
frequencies so much,

00:39:41.280 --> 00:39:44.310 align:middle line:84%
I like the idea of balance
as being able to see

00:39:44.310 --> 00:39:46.300 align:middle line:90%
is there in imbalance somewhere?

00:39:46.300 --> 00:39:48.150 align:middle line:84%
And it may not be
that this frequency is

00:39:48.150 --> 00:39:50.640 align:middle line:84%
good for my gallbladder, but
another one may be better

00:39:50.640 --> 00:39:51.840 align:middle line:90%
for your gallbladder.

00:39:51.840 --> 00:39:54.330 align:middle line:84%
It's about, where
is my imbalance?

00:39:54.330 --> 00:39:57.570 align:middle line:84%
And what can I do to try to
get my body back in balance?

00:39:57.570 --> 00:40:00.240 align:middle line:84%
And I think that's what I'd
like to see more research.

00:40:00.240 --> 00:40:01.470 align:middle line:90%
It's all about balance.

00:40:01.470 --> 00:40:03.312 align:middle line:90%
Just like hormones-- anything.

00:40:03.312 --> 00:40:04.270 align:middle line:90%
It's all about balance.

00:40:04.270 --> 00:40:06.090 align:middle line:84%
It's not about the
exact measurement.

00:40:06.090 --> 00:40:08.640 align:middle line:84%
Your testosterone level may
need to be higher than someone

00:40:08.640 --> 00:40:11.144 align:middle line:90%
else's for your optimal range.

00:40:11.144 --> 00:40:13.560 align:middle line:84%
But if your testosterone is
here and your estrogen's here,

00:40:13.560 --> 00:40:15.600 align:middle line:90%
we've got a problem.

00:40:15.600 --> 00:40:16.401 align:middle line:90%
About balance.

00:40:16.401 --> 00:40:18.441 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Well, let's talk
about hormone therapy,

00:40:18.441 --> 00:40:19.830 align:middle line:90%
and hormone replacement therapy.

00:40:19.830 --> 00:40:22.680 align:middle line:84%
And, you know, of course
that's made the news plenty.

00:40:22.680 --> 00:40:25.230 align:middle line:84%
And then you're
talking about, kind of,

00:40:25.230 --> 00:40:28.380 align:middle line:84%
single-source pharmaceuticals
that have caused problems,

00:40:28.380 --> 00:40:29.790 align:middle line:90%
and increased cancer rates.

00:40:29.790 --> 00:40:32.914 align:middle line:84%
So what is your take on, for
longevity and well-being,

00:40:32.914 --> 00:40:34.080 align:middle line:90%
hormone replacement therapy?

00:40:34.080 --> 00:40:36.870 align:middle line:84%
>>WORDEN: The take is, we
don't have all the answers yet.

00:40:36.870 --> 00:40:38.040 align:middle line:90%
That's the take.

00:40:38.040 --> 00:40:40.680 align:middle line:84%
And do we think that
bioidentical is safer

00:40:40.680 --> 00:40:43.480 align:middle line:90%
than traditional standard?

00:40:43.480 --> 00:40:44.280 align:middle line:90%
Yes, we do.

00:40:44.280 --> 00:40:46.950 align:middle line:84%
And there's some research that
I know of that can prove that

00:40:46.950 --> 00:40:48.120 align:middle line:90%
out a little bit.

00:40:48.120 --> 00:40:50.760 align:middle line:84%
But I'm more, again,
about balance.

00:40:50.760 --> 00:40:52.800 align:middle line:84%
Because can I tell
you, of a certainty,

00:40:52.800 --> 00:40:55.740 align:middle line:84%
that if I give you a
bioidentical hormone, that that

00:40:55.740 --> 00:40:57.640 align:middle line:90%
is not going to grow a cancer?

00:40:57.640 --> 00:41:00.150 align:middle line:90%
No one can tell you that answer.

00:41:00.150 --> 00:41:02.940 align:middle line:84%
And if you're OK with that,
and you say, my quality of life

00:41:02.940 --> 00:41:03.930 align:middle line:90%
is horrible.

00:41:03.930 --> 00:41:05.100 align:middle line:90%
I cannot sleep.

00:41:05.100 --> 00:41:05.910 align:middle line:90%
I cannot do this.

00:41:05.910 --> 00:41:07.737 align:middle line:84%
And we can't balance
it by working

00:41:07.737 --> 00:41:09.570 align:middle line:84%
on your adrenal glands
and your liver, which

00:41:09.570 --> 00:41:11.903 align:middle line:84%
are a big piece of whether
hormones are balanced or not.

00:41:11.903 --> 00:41:13.830 align:middle line:84%
If we can't get to it
naturally, if we've

00:41:13.830 --> 00:41:16.140 align:middle line:84%
done everything
possible and you're

00:41:16.140 --> 00:41:17.940 align:middle line:84%
willing to take
that risk, then I

00:41:17.940 --> 00:41:19.800 align:middle line:84%
might be willing to
take that risk with you.

00:41:19.800 --> 00:41:22.600 align:middle line:84%
And watch you very carefully
to make sure those hormones are

00:41:22.600 --> 00:41:23.400 align:middle line:90%
in a range.

00:41:23.400 --> 00:41:23.660 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Balanced.

00:41:23.660 --> 00:41:24.460 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:41:24.460 --> 00:41:27.090 align:middle line:84%
>>WORDEN: Balanced and in
range, but even then, I

00:41:27.090 --> 00:41:28.890 align:middle line:84%
have to tell you,
there's no way for me

00:41:28.890 --> 00:41:32.880 align:middle line:84%
to tell you that this will
not be potentiating a cancer.

00:41:32.880 --> 00:41:35.520 align:middle line:90%
And the science is very clear.

00:41:35.520 --> 00:41:37.510 align:middle line:84%
I don't think we can
tell you otherwise.

00:41:37.510 --> 00:41:39.890 align:middle line:84%
And to say that a
hormone is going to cure?

00:41:39.890 --> 00:41:40.920 align:middle line:90%
Maybe.

00:41:40.920 --> 00:41:42.150 align:middle line:90%
But we don't know that yet.

00:41:42.150 --> 00:41:43.410 align:middle line:90%
We can't tell you that yet.

00:41:43.410 --> 00:41:44.210 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: OK.

00:41:44.210 --> 00:41:46.590 align:middle line:90%
So still, not enough research.

00:41:46.590 --> 00:41:48.720 align:middle line:84%
>>WORDEN: And it's
still enough research

00:41:48.720 --> 00:41:52.320 align:middle line:84%
that has been done to show
the detrimental effect.

00:41:52.320 --> 00:41:55.320 align:middle line:84%
I'm more cautionary on
hormones than most doctors

00:41:55.320 --> 00:41:56.940 align:middle line:90%
that do hormone therapy.

00:41:56.940 --> 00:41:58.712 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: OK.

00:41:58.712 --> 00:42:00.420 align:middle line:84%
I was going to ask
you this a moment ago.

00:42:00.420 --> 00:42:03.270 align:middle line:90%


00:42:03.270 --> 00:42:04.710 align:middle line:90%
The means of diagnoses.

00:42:04.710 --> 00:42:06.230 align:middle line:90%
Because you use several of them.

00:42:06.230 --> 00:42:11.160 align:middle line:84%
Let's talk about classic
ones, because one doctor

00:42:11.160 --> 00:42:13.880 align:middle line:84%
will say that's really
not that great a measure.

00:42:13.880 --> 00:42:16.840 align:middle line:84%
And so let's start with
dark field microscopy.

00:42:16.840 --> 00:42:17.640 align:middle line:90%
>>WORDEN: Right.

00:42:17.640 --> 00:42:19.860 align:middle line:84%
It was one of the best
patient motivators I had.

00:42:19.860 --> 00:42:21.410 align:middle line:90%
I studied dark field--

00:42:21.410 --> 00:42:23.736 align:middle line:84%
not live cell,
which is different.

00:42:23.736 --> 00:42:25.110 align:middle line:84%
That's just looking
at the cells,

00:42:25.110 --> 00:42:28.020 align:middle line:84%
and it's gotten a black
eye because a lot of people

00:42:28.020 --> 00:42:29.730 align:middle line:84%
try to do that to
sell supplements.

00:42:29.730 --> 00:42:32.160 align:middle line:84%
And that's the way it's
seen in the industry.

00:42:32.160 --> 00:42:33.930 align:middle line:84%
Dark field is looking
at that background,

00:42:33.930 --> 00:42:36.960 align:middle line:84%
and that's that whole
pleomorphic theory

00:42:36.960 --> 00:42:40.800 align:middle line:84%
that a bacterial form can turn
into a viral and into a fungal,

00:42:40.800 --> 00:42:43.290 align:middle line:90%
and they morph back and forth.

00:42:43.290 --> 00:42:46.980 align:middle line:84%
Seeing that under a microscope
makes our traditional medicine

00:42:46.980 --> 00:42:48.640 align:middle line:90%
of immunology completely--

00:42:48.640 --> 00:42:49.440 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Obsolete.

00:42:49.440 --> 00:42:51.814 align:middle line:84%
>>WORDEN: --need to be obsolete,
and thrown out the door.

00:42:51.814 --> 00:42:54.600 align:middle line:84%
So you can understand
why that about--

00:42:54.600 --> 00:42:57.240 align:middle line:84%
it's been about eight or nine
years ago that I got a letter

00:42:57.240 --> 00:43:00.840 align:middle line:84%
from my board, medical board,
that said, OK, because OSHA--

00:43:00.840 --> 00:43:04.710 align:middle line:84%
that's the government
regulatory agency

00:43:04.710 --> 00:43:06.890 align:middle line:84%
that tells what kind
of lab certification

00:43:06.890 --> 00:43:09.390 align:middle line:84%
that you need to have, because
they don't know what this is,

00:43:09.390 --> 00:43:10.700 align:middle line:90%
or how to classify it.

00:43:10.700 --> 00:43:12.660 align:middle line:84%
And because you're
a doctor, you need

00:43:12.660 --> 00:43:15.510 align:middle line:84%
to either have this level
of lab, which would cost,

00:43:15.510 --> 00:43:17.190 align:middle line:84%
at that point,
almost $1 million--

00:43:17.190 --> 00:43:20.320 align:middle line:84%
an experimental lab, or
you need to stop doing it.

00:43:20.320 --> 00:43:21.580 align:middle line:90%
And so I had to stop doing it.

00:43:21.580 --> 00:43:23.400 align:middle line:84%
I put both of my
microscopes away,

00:43:23.400 --> 00:43:25.440 align:middle line:84%
and it was one of
the hardest things

00:43:25.440 --> 00:43:29.010 align:middle line:84%
I've done, because I
gathered so much information

00:43:29.010 --> 00:43:31.920 align:middle line:90%
from that dark field microscopy.

00:43:31.920 --> 00:43:35.050 align:middle line:84%
But as a physician, right now
I'm not allowed to use it.

00:43:35.050 --> 00:43:38.400 align:middle line:90%


00:43:38.400 --> 00:43:41.670 align:middle line:90%
But I wish that I could.

00:43:41.670 --> 00:43:42.990 align:middle line:90%
Because I learned a lot.

00:43:42.990 --> 00:43:44.520 align:middle line:84%
And it always
matched clinically,

00:43:44.520 --> 00:43:47.800 align:middle line:84%
and it gave me aha's that I
can't see in traditional blood

00:43:47.800 --> 00:43:48.600 align:middle line:90%
work.

00:43:48.600 --> 00:43:49.465 align:middle line:90%
I can't see it.

00:43:49.465 --> 00:43:51.090 align:middle line:84%
But I could see it
there, and then that

00:43:51.090 --> 00:43:54.780 align:middle line:84%
allowed me to go into more
in-depth traditional ways

00:43:54.780 --> 00:43:56.850 align:middle line:90%
of looking at things to find it.

00:43:56.850 --> 00:43:58.240 align:middle line:90%
And then prove it there.

00:43:58.240 --> 00:43:59.040 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:43:59.040 --> 00:44:00.310 align:middle line:90%
Now, that makes perfect sense.

00:44:00.310 --> 00:44:02.956 align:middle line:90%
>>WORDEN: I can't do it anymore.

00:44:02.956 --> 00:44:03.780 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Oh.

00:44:03.780 --> 00:44:04.320 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:44:04.320 --> 00:44:05.380 align:middle line:90%
That's a sad story.

00:44:05.380 --> 00:44:06.910 align:middle line:90%
>>WORDEN: That's a sad story.

00:44:06.910 --> 00:44:09.900 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So let's go back
to live cell microscopy.

00:44:09.900 --> 00:44:13.254 align:middle line:84%
And if it's done properly,
if it's done well--

00:44:13.254 --> 00:44:14.420 align:middle line:90%
>>WORDEN: Again, live cell--

00:44:14.420 --> 00:44:15.180 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: --what
does it give you?

00:44:15.180 --> 00:44:16.180 align:middle line:84%
>>WORDEN: In
traditional medicine,

00:44:16.180 --> 00:44:18.420 align:middle line:84%
the only way that live
cell would be looked at

00:44:18.420 --> 00:44:19.961 align:middle line:84%
is that you can look
at whether we've

00:44:19.961 --> 00:44:22.259 align:middle line:84%
got a bacteria in
a urine, or a blood

00:44:22.259 --> 00:44:24.300 align:middle line:84%
to look at, that-- you
really just look at urine,

00:44:24.300 --> 00:44:26.570 align:middle line:84%
and whether you're anemic
or not, looking at the size

00:44:26.570 --> 00:44:28.699 align:middle line:84%
and the morphology of the
red blood cell itself.

00:44:28.699 --> 00:44:30.240 align:middle line:84%
All the other stuff
that people say--

00:44:30.240 --> 00:44:31.950 align:middle line:84%
I can see a
parasite, I can see--

00:44:31.950 --> 00:44:36.210 align:middle line:84%
that is not generally
seen in live cell.

00:44:36.210 --> 00:44:40.740 align:middle line:84%
So there is a lot, again, of
misnomers and myth out there

00:44:40.740 --> 00:44:42.930 align:middle line:84%
about what we can and
cannot see in live cell.

00:44:42.930 --> 00:44:44.940 align:middle line:90%
And I don't do live cell.

00:44:44.940 --> 00:44:47.100 align:middle line:90%
I don't do that, as well.

00:44:47.100 --> 00:44:49.090 align:middle line:84%
I want to do my
dark field again.

00:44:49.090 --> 00:44:50.330 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:44:50.330 --> 00:44:52.080 align:middle line:84%
Is there any hope on
the horizon for that?

00:44:52.080 --> 00:44:53.660 align:middle line:84%
>>WORDEN: Not in the
immediate future.

00:44:53.660 --> 00:44:54.460 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Why?

00:44:54.460 --> 00:44:57.690 align:middle line:84%
>>WORDEN: It would take a
very expansive IRB, which

00:44:57.690 --> 00:45:00.780 align:middle line:84%
is the Investigational
Review Board,

00:45:00.780 --> 00:45:03.380 align:middle line:84%
to be able to use
that on humans.

00:45:03.380 --> 00:45:06.010 align:middle line:84%
And to be able to look
at it, and lots of data.

00:45:06.010 --> 00:45:07.200 align:middle line:90%
You know, we looked at it.

00:45:07.200 --> 00:45:08.908 align:middle line:84%
A group of us looked
at that for a while.

00:45:08.908 --> 00:45:11.430 align:middle line:84%
Because I was on a board
for my naturopathic medicine

00:45:11.430 --> 00:45:14.310 align:middle line:84%
for investigational therapies,
that we were able to do this.

00:45:14.310 --> 00:45:17.820 align:middle line:84%
But whenever that came down
about OSHA, it was just who--

00:45:17.820 --> 00:45:19.807 align:middle line:84%
an individual
practitioner is not

00:45:19.807 --> 00:45:21.140 align:middle line:90%
going to afford a lab like that.

00:45:21.140 --> 00:45:22.473 align:middle line:90%
And you're not going to fund it.

00:45:22.473 --> 00:45:24.430 align:middle line:84%
Again, it's not something
that you can patent,

00:45:24.430 --> 00:45:27.110 align:middle line:84%
so what are you going
to do when you prove it?

00:45:27.110 --> 00:45:29.600 align:middle line:84%
You can't even
pay yourself back.

00:45:29.600 --> 00:45:32.900 align:middle line:84%
But there are practitioners
around the world

00:45:32.900 --> 00:45:35.560 align:middle line:84%
in other places that are
still using dark field.

00:45:35.560 --> 00:45:37.290 align:middle line:90%
There are.

00:45:37.290 --> 00:45:38.550 align:middle line:90%
People can find them.

00:45:38.550 --> 00:45:39.860 align:middle line:90%
They can even find them here.

00:45:39.860 --> 00:45:40.100 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Oh, they can.

00:45:40.100 --> 00:45:40.160 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:45:40.160 --> 00:45:41.159 align:middle line:90%
>>WORDEN: Germany-- yes.

00:45:41.159 --> 00:45:43.640 align:middle line:84%
Most of this was coming
out of Germany and Europe,

00:45:43.640 --> 00:45:46.610 align:middle line:84%
and that was some
of my teachers.

00:45:46.610 --> 00:45:48.860 align:middle line:84%
So Germany, probably,
is still the leader.

00:45:48.860 --> 00:45:53.120 align:middle line:84%
Dr. Enderlein is the one that
came up, that did dark field

00:45:53.120 --> 00:45:55.490 align:middle line:84%
and started looking at
this pleomorphic theory.

00:45:55.490 --> 00:45:57.940 align:middle line:84%
That these cells change
amongst themselves.

00:45:57.940 --> 00:46:00.670 align:middle line:84%
And that's what-- there was
a whole group of medicine--

00:46:00.670 --> 00:46:02.169 align:middle line:84%
Sanum-- that was
built along that.

00:46:02.169 --> 00:46:04.460 align:middle line:84%
And it's hard to get those
injectables into the country

00:46:04.460 --> 00:46:04.955 align:middle line:90%
now.

00:46:04.955 --> 00:46:05.755 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Oh, yes.

00:46:05.755 --> 00:46:09.600 align:middle line:84%
But that was more kind of a
germ therapy related to that?

00:46:09.600 --> 00:46:10.400 align:middle line:90%
>>WORDEN: Somewhat.

00:46:10.400 --> 00:46:11.260 align:middle line:90%
But everything.

00:46:11.260 --> 00:46:14.570 align:middle line:84%
But yeah, we're looking at that
background, that dark field.

00:46:14.570 --> 00:46:15.950 align:middle line:90%
And to be able to see--

00:46:15.950 --> 00:46:17.510 align:middle line:90%
cancer looks like a fungal form.

00:46:17.510 --> 00:46:19.130 align:middle line:90%
Looks like a fungal cell.

00:46:19.130 --> 00:46:21.830 align:middle line:84%
And so if you're getting
better, that fungal form

00:46:21.830 --> 00:46:25.460 align:middle line:84%
turns back into bacterial,
and back into viral.

00:46:25.460 --> 00:46:29.420 align:middle line:84%
But again, this flies in the
face of mainstream medicine.

00:46:29.420 --> 00:46:31.640 align:middle line:84%
And I had two
microbiologists come

00:46:31.640 --> 00:46:33.560 align:middle line:84%
in when I had my
microscopes, and I

00:46:33.560 --> 00:46:36.437 align:middle line:84%
said, come tell me what
you think you're seeing.

00:46:36.437 --> 00:46:37.270 align:middle line:90%
And they would sit--

00:46:37.270 --> 00:46:38.810 align:middle line:90%
one sat there for hours.

00:46:38.810 --> 00:46:40.355 align:middle line:90%
And came and said, I--

00:46:40.355 --> 00:46:41.350 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: --don't even
believe what I'm seeing.

00:46:41.350 --> 00:46:42.470 align:middle line:84%
>>WORDEN: --it's got
to be an artifact.

00:46:42.470 --> 00:46:44.510 align:middle line:84%
And I said, what do
you really think?

00:46:44.510 --> 00:46:46.285 align:middle line:90%
And he said, I--

00:46:46.285 --> 00:46:47.910 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: It doesn't
work like that.

00:46:47.910 --> 00:46:50.690 align:middle line:84%
>>WORDEN: It doesn't work like
that, and I can't explain it,

00:46:50.690 --> 00:46:53.450 align:middle line:90%
so I don't know what I'm seeing.

00:46:53.450 --> 00:46:55.900 align:middle line:90%
And so that's the problem.

00:46:55.900 --> 00:46:59.870 align:middle line:84%
It's so completely against
our system of medicine.

00:46:59.870 --> 00:47:02.300 align:middle line:84%
Now, you either
get an anti-viral,

00:47:02.300 --> 00:47:04.640 align:middle line:84%
you get an antibacterial,
and an antifungal medicine.

00:47:04.640 --> 00:47:05.895 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:47:05.895 --> 00:47:06.770 align:middle line:90%
Right.

00:47:06.770 --> 00:47:09.710 align:middle line:84%
30 years ago, I was out in
the field with a cameraman,

00:47:09.710 --> 00:47:13.100 align:middle line:84%
in Europe, hunting down
energy medicine sources,

00:47:13.100 --> 00:47:14.840 align:middle line:90%
and came across a man--

00:47:14.840 --> 00:47:16.970 align:middle line:84%
Steven Ross, whom I've
interviewed a few times.

00:47:16.970 --> 00:47:19.680 align:middle line:84%
He and I were on the same
hunt at the same time,

00:47:19.680 --> 00:47:22.700 align:middle line:84%
which is how he became so
involved with energy medicine,

00:47:22.700 --> 00:47:25.340 align:middle line:84%
looking for the same obscure
players that people in the US

00:47:25.340 --> 00:47:26.390 align:middle line:90%
aren't aware of.

00:47:26.390 --> 00:47:30.480 align:middle line:84%
And I was doing it as
a pilot for a series.

00:47:30.480 --> 00:47:31.280 align:middle line:90%
Anyway.

00:47:31.280 --> 00:47:35.930 align:middle line:84%
The point is, we met with a man
named Bernard Mauchline, an MD

00:47:35.930 --> 00:47:40.490 align:middle line:84%
working with energy medicine,
and in companionship

00:47:40.490 --> 00:47:42.920 align:middle line:84%
with a man named
Kurt Olbrich, who had

00:47:42.920 --> 00:47:46.280 align:middle line:90%
invented a new Rife-type scope.

00:47:46.280 --> 00:47:48.020 align:middle line:90%
The Ergonom 400.

00:47:48.020 --> 00:47:49.600 align:middle line:90%
And that scope--

00:47:49.600 --> 00:47:52.730 align:middle line:84%
I watched film of exactly
what you were talking about.

00:47:52.730 --> 00:47:53.780 align:middle line:90%
That morphing.

00:47:53.780 --> 00:47:54.738 align:middle line:90%
>>WORDEN: That's right.

00:47:54.738 --> 00:47:56.840 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And again,
medical doctors

00:47:56.840 --> 00:47:58.520 align:middle line:84%
would deny it,
looking right at it.

00:47:58.520 --> 00:47:58.865 align:middle line:84%
>>WORDEN: Microbiology,
modern medicine--

00:47:58.865 --> 00:48:00.135 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: To keep us stuck.

00:48:00.135 --> 00:48:01.135 align:middle line:90%
>>WORDEN: That's-- yeah.

00:48:01.135 --> 00:48:04.540 align:middle line:84%
They just can't look at it
and say artifact, and have--

00:48:04.540 --> 00:48:08.150 align:middle line:84%
But the electron microscope
used in traditional--

00:48:08.150 --> 00:48:11.216 align:middle line:84%
you look at what's happening
under an electron microscope?

00:48:11.216 --> 00:48:12.590 align:middle line:84%
That's talking
about this matrix.

00:48:12.590 --> 00:48:14.540 align:middle line:84%
That's looking at this matrix
that we're talking about.

00:48:14.540 --> 00:48:16.123 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Well, and
another one called

00:48:16.123 --> 00:48:19.830 align:middle line:84%
the nemoscope came along, and
that was looking at it live.

00:48:19.830 --> 00:48:24.260 align:middle line:84%
Now, that is where my
mind really lit up.

00:48:24.260 --> 00:48:29.630 align:middle line:84%
Because it was showing
the molecular--

00:48:29.630 --> 00:48:32.840 align:middle line:84%
energetic molecular
structure of elements,

00:48:32.840 --> 00:48:34.160 align:middle line:90%
including, like, iron.

00:48:34.160 --> 00:48:38.900 align:middle line:84%
But it shows this movement
in a hexagonal pattern

00:48:38.900 --> 00:48:42.890 align:middle line:84%
of the energy, back to the
sacred geometrical energetic

00:48:42.890 --> 00:48:44.870 align:middle line:90%
life force in all of our bodies.

00:48:44.870 --> 00:48:46.620 align:middle line:90%
In everything.

00:48:46.620 --> 00:48:47.420 align:middle line:90%
>>WORDEN: I know.

00:48:47.420 --> 00:48:50.360 align:middle line:84%
I just-- it's the
funding that's needed

00:48:50.360 --> 00:48:52.640 align:middle line:84%
to prove the things
that we already know,

00:48:52.640 --> 00:48:54.274 align:middle line:84%
that have been
around for millennia.

00:48:54.274 --> 00:48:55.940 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Well, they'd
have to also stop

00:48:55.940 --> 00:48:58.400 align:middle line:84%
killing the people that
create the technologies.

00:48:58.400 --> 00:48:59.570 align:middle line:90%
>>WORDEN: That would help.

00:48:59.570 --> 00:49:01.696 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And confiscating
their technology

00:49:01.696 --> 00:49:04.640 align:middle line:84%
and using it for military
weaponization, which is what

00:49:04.640 --> 00:49:06.620 align:middle line:90%
they did with the nemoscope.

00:49:06.620 --> 00:49:08.810 align:middle line:84%
>>WORDEN: You know, any
time that anything flies

00:49:08.810 --> 00:49:10.430 align:middle line:84%
in the face of the
standard of the way

00:49:10.430 --> 00:49:12.096 align:middle line:84%
that it is, it's going
to-- you have got

00:49:12.096 --> 00:49:14.120 align:middle line:90%
to be tough to withstand that.

00:49:14.120 --> 00:49:17.810 align:middle line:84%
And the brave souls that
continue to say that message,

00:49:17.810 --> 00:49:20.180 align:middle line:84%
and not be afraid to
say it, and go forward.

00:49:20.180 --> 00:49:22.650 align:middle line:84%
It's just the way
it has always been.

00:49:22.650 --> 00:49:23.450 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:49:23.450 --> 00:49:24.370 align:middle line:90%
It threatens the establishment.

00:49:24.370 --> 00:49:25.280 align:middle line:90%
>>WORDEN: It threatens it.

00:49:25.280 --> 00:49:26.080 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: OK.

00:49:26.080 --> 00:49:28.670 align:middle line:84%
Let's go on to-- a little more
mundane, now-- but it's OK.

00:49:28.670 --> 00:49:29.590 align:middle line:90%
Saliva tests.

00:49:29.590 --> 00:49:32.480 align:middle line:84%
Because a lot of doctors
work really now with saliva,

00:49:32.480 --> 00:49:33.800 align:middle line:90%
even over blood.

00:49:33.800 --> 00:49:35.540 align:middle line:84%
So the advantages--
so people that

00:49:35.540 --> 00:49:37.310 align:middle line:84%
are going in for these tests
know what they're dealing with.

00:49:37.310 --> 00:49:38.510 align:middle line:90%
>>WORDEN: Right.

00:49:38.510 --> 00:49:40.280 align:middle line:84%
Saliva test I like,
if we're looking

00:49:40.280 --> 00:49:41.320 align:middle line:90%
at cortisol or hormones.

00:49:41.320 --> 00:49:43.340 align:middle line:84%
It's showing rhythms
night and day.

00:49:43.340 --> 00:49:44.750 align:middle line:90%
And those are important.

00:49:44.750 --> 00:49:46.250 align:middle line:84%
But the standard
still, if you're

00:49:46.250 --> 00:49:49.040 align:middle line:84%
going to prescribe
something, the blood

00:49:49.040 --> 00:49:52.350 align:middle line:84%
is more accurate for the actual
number to prescribe from.

00:49:52.350 --> 00:49:53.150 align:middle line:90%
Right?

00:49:53.150 --> 00:49:56.490 align:middle line:84%
But you can do an AM
and a PM cortisol.

00:49:56.490 --> 00:49:58.580 align:middle line:84%
So my patients, if
they have insurance,

00:49:58.580 --> 00:50:01.740 align:middle line:84%
I want to use that insurance
for their purposes.

00:50:01.740 --> 00:50:04.100 align:middle line:84%
So if I do and AM
and a PM cortisol,

00:50:04.100 --> 00:50:06.050 align:middle line:90%
it's showing me that cycle.

00:50:06.050 --> 00:50:07.640 align:middle line:84%
Whereas if I was
doing the saliva,

00:50:07.640 --> 00:50:09.200 align:middle line:90%
they would have to pay cash.

00:50:09.200 --> 00:50:11.390 align:middle line:84%
And it would show
me the same cycle.

00:50:11.390 --> 00:50:15.890 align:middle line:84%
So I do a lot of blood testing
under insurance when I can.

00:50:15.890 --> 00:50:21.200 align:middle line:84%
Not to negate the effect of how
well saliva can work for us.

00:50:21.200 --> 00:50:23.660 align:middle line:84%
But if I'm looking at
the patient's pocketbook,

00:50:23.660 --> 00:50:25.820 align:middle line:84%
I try to use the
least expensive that

00:50:25.820 --> 00:50:27.070 align:middle line:90%
gives me the same information.

00:50:27.070 --> 00:50:29.440 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: No, and that's
a very considerate way

00:50:29.440 --> 00:50:32.680 align:middle line:84%
to look at it on
behalf of the patient.

00:50:32.680 --> 00:50:34.720 align:middle line:84%
We have about five
minutes left, and we've

00:50:34.720 --> 00:50:36.730 align:middle line:84%
talked about so
many things, and I

00:50:36.730 --> 00:50:40.210 align:middle line:84%
would like to really
allow you to give us

00:50:40.210 --> 00:50:42.670 align:middle line:84%
a portrait of someone
coming in, in terms

00:50:42.670 --> 00:50:48.304 align:middle line:84%
of the way in which you might
blend these therapies together.

00:50:48.304 --> 00:50:53.900 align:middle line:84%
From nutraceuticals to
energy devices to mind/body,

00:50:53.900 --> 00:50:54.700 align:middle line:90%
and so forth.

00:50:54.700 --> 00:50:56.375 align:middle line:84%
Maybe take one of
your favorite cases

00:50:56.375 --> 00:50:59.440 align:middle line:84%
that just looked
hopeless, so that we can

00:50:59.440 --> 00:51:00.940 align:middle line:90%
see how it works functionally.

00:51:00.940 --> 00:51:02.356 align:middle line:84%
>>WORDEN: You know,
sometimes it's

00:51:02.356 --> 00:51:04.180 align:middle line:84%
a lot easier than you
think, if you really

00:51:04.180 --> 00:51:05.180 align:middle line:90%
listen to the patient.

00:51:05.180 --> 00:51:06.870 align:middle line:84%
And I think that's
what we've lost.

00:51:06.870 --> 00:51:09.610 align:middle line:84%
A patient comes to see me,
they've got an hour and a half.

00:51:09.610 --> 00:51:12.460 align:middle line:84%
And they've already
filled out an intake

00:51:12.460 --> 00:51:15.340 align:middle line:84%
that took them already
another hour to fill out.

00:51:15.340 --> 00:51:18.070 align:middle line:84%
And I know that intake,
and I know those questions.

00:51:18.070 --> 00:51:21.170 align:middle line:84%
And by looking at every
piece of them-- emotionally,

00:51:21.170 --> 00:51:23.470 align:middle line:84%
spiritually,
physically, mentally--

00:51:23.470 --> 00:51:26.470 align:middle line:84%
by looking at that, and knowing
what their belief system is,

00:51:26.470 --> 00:51:29.070 align:middle line:90%
then I can work.

00:51:29.070 --> 00:51:31.090 align:middle line:84%
If I told an 80-year-old
that I wanted

00:51:31.090 --> 00:51:32.860 align:middle line:84%
to do food allergy
testing on them

00:51:32.860 --> 00:51:34.330 align:middle line:84%
and they were going
to have to stop

00:51:34.330 --> 00:51:37.210 align:middle line:84%
eating their favorite
food, that's probably not

00:51:37.210 --> 00:51:38.740 align:middle line:90%
going to go over really well.

00:51:38.740 --> 00:51:39.540 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:51:39.540 --> 00:51:41.570 align:middle line:84%
That's maybe their
last pleasure.

00:51:41.570 --> 00:51:43.579 align:middle line:84%
>>WORDEN: And that's
not the right medicine,

00:51:43.579 --> 00:51:45.370 align:middle line:84%
even though it would
be the right medicine.

00:51:45.370 --> 00:51:47.120 align:middle line:84%
That may be what's
causing their symptoms.

00:51:47.120 --> 00:51:49.870 align:middle line:84%
If I get a certain 80-year-old
that says, I don't care,

00:51:49.870 --> 00:51:52.660 align:middle line:84%
you test it, I'm willing to
do anything, then we'll do it.

00:51:52.660 --> 00:51:55.330 align:middle line:84%
So it's really the belief
system of the patient, what

00:51:55.330 --> 00:51:57.537 align:middle line:84%
their pocketbook is allowing
them to do, what can I

00:51:57.537 --> 00:51:59.620 align:middle line:84%
get covered under insurance
that doesn't cost them

00:51:59.620 --> 00:52:01.380 align:middle line:90%
anything, and look there.

00:52:01.380 --> 00:52:05.380 align:middle line:84%
But I pride myself in
my diagnostic ability.

00:52:05.380 --> 00:52:09.100 align:middle line:84%
And that's putting all of these
dots, and connecting them.

00:52:09.100 --> 00:52:12.820 align:middle line:84%
And if you have to leave
with a bag of supplements,

00:52:12.820 --> 00:52:17.174 align:middle line:84%
and patients come in with
bags and bags, I still think,

00:52:17.174 --> 00:52:19.090 align:middle line:84%
even though it's a natural
way of treating it,

00:52:19.090 --> 00:52:20.950 align:middle line:84%
you haven't found the
root of the problem.

00:52:20.950 --> 00:52:22.366 align:middle line:84%
And if you're
taking more than two

00:52:22.366 --> 00:52:25.630 align:middle line:84%
or three nutraceutical
or supplements,

00:52:25.630 --> 00:52:27.010 align:middle line:90%
I think maybe it's too much.

00:52:27.010 --> 00:52:28.210 align:middle line:84%
And if you're still
having symptoms,

00:52:28.210 --> 00:52:30.070 align:middle line:84%
you haven't found the
root of that problem.

00:52:30.070 --> 00:52:33.520 align:middle line:84%
Usually, once you find
what's causing the symptom

00:52:33.520 --> 00:52:35.650 align:middle line:84%
and you fix that,
everything gets better.

00:52:35.650 --> 00:52:37.510 align:middle line:84%
And it might be that
your hair's falling out

00:52:37.510 --> 00:52:39.730 align:middle line:84%
and your leg hurts, and
they could be connected,

00:52:39.730 --> 00:52:41.530 align:middle line:90%
but we see them differently.

00:52:41.530 --> 00:52:43.390 align:middle line:84%
You go to a cardiologist
for your heart.

00:52:43.390 --> 00:52:46.700 align:middle line:84%
You go to a gastroenterologist
for your stomach.

00:52:46.700 --> 00:52:49.030 align:middle line:84%
And nobody's looking
at the whole anymore.

00:52:49.030 --> 00:52:52.540 align:middle line:84%
That's why holistic medicine,
or natural practitioners, we're

00:52:52.540 --> 00:52:54.460 align:middle line:90%
looking at everything.

00:52:54.460 --> 00:52:57.130 align:middle line:84%
We're looking at the whole
elephant, not just the tail.

00:52:57.130 --> 00:52:57.930 align:middle line:90%
Right?

00:52:57.930 --> 00:52:59.710 align:middle line:84%
And so when you take
the time to listen,

00:52:59.710 --> 00:53:00.985 align:middle line:90%
the answers are always there.

00:53:00.985 --> 00:53:03.260 align:middle line:84%
And guess where most
of the answers are?

00:53:03.260 --> 00:53:04.990 align:middle line:90%
They're coming from the patient.

00:53:04.990 --> 00:53:06.070 align:middle line:90%
Not from all the tests.

00:53:06.070 --> 00:53:06.870 align:middle line:90%
It's cool.

00:53:06.870 --> 00:53:07.580 align:middle line:90%
I like to see it.

00:53:07.580 --> 00:53:08.540 align:middle line:90%
I find interesting things.

00:53:08.540 --> 00:53:09.970 align:middle line:84%
And they're, like,
how did nobody

00:53:09.970 --> 00:53:11.410 align:middle line:90%
see this for the last 30 years?

00:53:11.410 --> 00:53:12.310 align:middle line:90%
And they're angry.

00:53:12.310 --> 00:53:13.390 align:middle line:90%
How did they miss it?

00:53:13.390 --> 00:53:14.450 align:middle line:90%
How did they--

00:53:14.450 --> 00:53:16.480 align:middle line:84%
It's because I listened,
to be able to know what

00:53:16.480 --> 00:53:17.830 align:middle line:90%
test I needed to be able to do.

00:53:17.830 --> 00:53:21.717 align:middle line:84%
But the answer ultimately
came from the patient.

00:53:21.717 --> 00:53:23.800 align:middle line:84%
By asking again and again,
well, I have this ache.

00:53:23.800 --> 00:53:24.420 align:middle line:90%
Well, when did it start?

00:53:24.420 --> 00:53:25.810 align:middle line:90%
Well, why do you have this?

00:53:25.810 --> 00:53:27.280 align:middle line:90%
Well, I have autoimmune disease.

00:53:27.280 --> 00:53:29.860 align:middle line:84%
Well, why do you have
autoimmune disease?

00:53:29.860 --> 00:53:30.880 align:middle line:90%
Well, I don't know.

00:53:30.880 --> 00:53:33.220 align:middle line:90%
So we keep asking why.

00:53:33.220 --> 00:53:36.520 align:middle line:84%
And the truth is,
is that if you keep

00:53:36.520 --> 00:53:39.230 align:middle line:84%
asking why, why,
why, far enough back,

00:53:39.230 --> 00:53:42.620 align:middle line:84%
it usually stems from an
emotional, spiritual issue.

00:53:42.620 --> 00:53:43.960 align:middle line:90%
It really does.

00:53:43.960 --> 00:53:46.810 align:middle line:84%
So all this physical stuff
that we love to play in--

00:53:46.810 --> 00:53:48.670 align:middle line:84%
I love genetics,
and epigenetics,

00:53:48.670 --> 00:53:50.715 align:middle line:84%
and all the molecules,
and nutraceuticals,

00:53:50.715 --> 00:53:52.590 align:middle line:84%
and our formulating,
and do all these things.

00:53:52.590 --> 00:53:54.100 align:middle line:84%
I love energy
medicine and all that.

00:53:54.100 --> 00:53:56.410 align:middle line:84%
But it really comes
back to energy.

00:53:56.410 --> 00:53:57.220 align:middle line:90%
Not a device.

00:53:57.220 --> 00:53:58.540 align:middle line:90%
Not an nutraceutical.

00:53:58.540 --> 00:54:02.710 align:middle line:84%
What's wrong in that
patient's field that's not

00:54:02.710 --> 00:54:04.630 align:middle line:90%
allowing their body to heal?

00:54:04.630 --> 00:54:08.320 align:middle line:84%
And so, you know, I use
apitherapy, bee venom therapy,

00:54:08.320 --> 00:54:13.570 align:middle line:84%
for rheumatoid arthritis
and MS, with great effect.

00:54:13.570 --> 00:54:15.820 align:middle line:84%
Great effect, for
those patients that

00:54:15.820 --> 00:54:17.860 align:middle line:84%
aren't quite willing to
go all the steps back

00:54:17.860 --> 00:54:20.660 align:middle line:90%
that we might want to do.

00:54:20.660 --> 00:54:24.790 align:middle line:84%
But it's interesting to me that
the longer I practice medicine,

00:54:24.790 --> 00:54:26.200 align:middle line:90%
the easier it becomes.

00:54:26.200 --> 00:54:29.625 align:middle line:84%
Because it's not a plethora of
a bunch of things going wrong.

00:54:29.625 --> 00:54:31.107 align:middle line:84%
It's usually a
few simple things,

00:54:31.107 --> 00:54:33.190 align:middle line:84%
but they're the deep hidden
things that you really

00:54:33.190 --> 00:54:34.720 align:middle line:90%
have to listen to find.

00:54:34.720 --> 00:54:36.820 align:middle line:10%
And you fix that, and
all kinds of things

00:54:36.820 --> 00:54:38.380 align:middle line:10%
get better, that
you're, like, I,

00:54:38.380 --> 00:54:40.930 align:middle line:10%
again, as a physician,
mechanically, neurologically,

00:54:40.930 --> 00:54:43.060 align:middle line:10%
and hormonally, I
don't see how that just

00:54:43.060 --> 00:54:44.470 align:middle line:10%
happened in that moment.

00:54:44.470 --> 00:54:46.330 align:middle line:10%
But it did.

00:54:46.330 --> 00:54:49.240 align:middle line:10%
And that's far beyond
our traditional medicine,

00:54:49.240 --> 00:54:51.550 align:middle line:10%
and traditional ways
of looking at things.

00:54:51.550 --> 00:54:52.960 align:middle line:90%
That's the exciting part.

00:54:52.960 --> 00:54:54.100 align:middle line:90%
We're amazing.

00:54:54.100 --> 00:54:56.980 align:middle line:84%
These human bodies,
we are amazing.

00:54:56.980 --> 00:55:01.300 align:middle line:84%
And if we get out of our own
way, and out of our own head,

00:55:01.300 --> 00:55:03.640 align:middle line:84%
and get back where we
should be-- into our heart,

00:55:03.640 --> 00:55:06.250 align:middle line:84%
and into the places that
allow healing-- then

00:55:06.250 --> 00:55:09.870 align:middle line:90%
it's miraculous what can happen.

00:55:09.870 --> 00:55:11.110 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Well, indeed.

00:55:11.110 --> 00:55:13.750 align:middle line:84%
And I just can't
tell you how much

00:55:13.750 --> 00:55:16.480 align:middle line:84%
I appreciate not only your
wisdom, but your commitment.

00:55:16.480 --> 00:55:18.880 align:middle line:84%
Your commitment to
really seeking the truth

00:55:18.880 --> 00:55:21.310 align:middle line:84%
behind healing, for each
individual and collectively.

00:55:21.310 --> 00:55:23.560 align:middle line:84%
And I have a feeling we'll
be seeing a lot more of you

00:55:23.560 --> 00:55:24.100 align:middle line:90%
around here.

00:55:24.100 --> 00:55:24.775 align:middle line:90%
>>WORDEN: I appreciate it.

00:55:24.775 --> 00:55:25.858 align:middle line:90%
Thank you so much, Regina.

00:55:25.858 --> 00:55:27.270 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Thank you, Donese.

00:55:27.270 --> 00:55:28.980 align:middle line:84%
I hope you found
these conversations

00:55:28.980 --> 00:55:30.930 align:middle line:90%
enlightening and empowering.

00:55:30.930 --> 00:55:33.270 align:middle line:84%
Taking the fear out of
a startling diagnosis

00:55:33.270 --> 00:55:35.250 align:middle line:84%
is what this
information is about.

00:55:35.250 --> 00:55:37.150 align:middle line:10%
