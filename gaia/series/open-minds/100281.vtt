>>REGINA MEREDITH: There's a
new technology in philosophy

00:00:30.180 --> 00:00:33.730 align:middle line:10%
that's emerged over the last
decade called transhumanism.

00:00:33.730 --> 00:00:35.330 align:middle line:84%
Though there were
cloaked mentions

00:00:35.330 --> 00:00:37.450 align:middle line:84%
in literary pieces
of past times,

00:00:37.450 --> 00:00:40.140 align:middle line:84%
transhumanism is gaining
mainstream attention.

00:00:40.140 --> 00:00:41.960 align:middle line:84%
But what does it
mean for humanity?

00:00:41.960 --> 00:00:44.220 align:middle line:84%
Byron Belitsos,
leading publisher

00:00:44.220 --> 00:00:46.030 align:middle line:84%
of the works about
"The Urantia Book"

00:00:46.030 --> 00:00:48.190 align:middle line:84%
and many other profound
works, is with us

00:00:48.190 --> 00:00:51.900 align:middle line:84%
to discuss the human history
of tranhuman interventionism

00:00:51.900 --> 00:00:54.660 align:middle line:84%
and the question of
spiritual ethics.

00:00:54.660 --> 00:00:56.560 align:middle line:84%
I think I meant to say
"transhumanism," not

00:00:56.560 --> 00:00:58.080 align:middle line:90%
"tranhumanism."

00:00:58.080 --> 00:00:59.190 align:middle line:90%
Anyway, Byron, welcome.

00:00:59.190 --> 00:01:00.900 align:middle line:90%
This is a very touchy topic.

00:01:00.900 --> 00:01:03.610 align:middle line:84%
It has a lot of light,
a lot of potential.

00:01:03.610 --> 00:01:07.430 align:middle line:84%
It has a lot of dark, but it,
like everything else in life,

00:01:07.430 --> 00:01:12.450 align:middle line:84%
it seems to matter whose
hands the power is in.

00:01:12.450 --> 00:01:13.160 align:middle line:90%
Right?

00:01:13.160 --> 00:01:14.370 align:middle line:84%
>>BYRON BELITSOS: Right,
like anything else.

00:01:14.370 --> 00:01:16.536 align:middle line:84%
And first, Regina, it's
just an honor and a pleasure

00:01:16.536 --> 00:01:18.160 align:middle line:90%
to be back on "Open Minds."

00:01:18.160 --> 00:01:19.290 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Thank you.

00:01:19.290 --> 00:01:21.360 align:middle line:84%
So first of all,
let's talk about what

00:01:21.360 --> 00:01:23.200 align:middle line:84%
is the definition
of transhumanism

00:01:23.200 --> 00:01:24.557 align:middle line:90%
as we understand it today.

00:01:24.557 --> 00:01:26.890 align:middle line:84%
Because we have a lot of
people in the world of science.

00:01:26.890 --> 00:01:29.490 align:middle line:84%
We have sites like
intelligence.org.

00:01:29.490 --> 00:01:31.880 align:middle line:84%
We have a lot of
brainiacs at MIT

00:01:31.880 --> 00:01:35.070 align:middle line:84%
trying to perpetuate
the notion of what

00:01:35.070 --> 00:01:38.560 align:middle line:84%
our future will look like
being enhanced by technology.

00:01:38.560 --> 00:01:40.560 align:middle line:84%
>>BELITSOS: Well, I think
that's the definition.

00:01:40.560 --> 00:01:43.950 align:middle line:10%
It's an enhancement of human
capacities with technology.

00:01:43.950 --> 00:01:48.350 align:middle line:10%
Mainly I think genetic
biotech and genetics.

00:01:48.350 --> 00:01:52.470 align:middle line:10%
But also, of course, AI
and computing advances

00:01:52.470 --> 00:01:56.270 align:middle line:10%
that can make it possible to
create robots that can actually

00:01:56.270 --> 00:02:00.290 align:middle line:10%
emulate human capacities, such
as emulating the brain itself,

00:02:00.290 --> 00:02:03.140 align:middle line:10%
which is the great
project that was funded,

00:02:03.140 --> 00:02:05.210 align:middle line:10%
I just found out, by
the European Commission.

00:02:05.210 --> 00:02:10.270 align:middle line:84%
They put a billion dollars
into funding brain emulation

00:02:10.270 --> 00:02:11.430 align:middle line:90%
software.

00:02:11.430 --> 00:02:13.030 align:middle line:84%
All the capacity
of the brain will

00:02:13.030 --> 00:02:17.860 align:middle line:84%
be programmed into a
single program that

00:02:17.860 --> 00:02:19.190 align:middle line:90%
will emulate the human brain.

00:02:19.190 --> 00:02:21.270 align:middle line:90%
So this is really going far.

00:02:21.270 --> 00:02:23.650 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: It's going far, but
every time I hear about it,

00:02:23.650 --> 00:02:27.150 align:middle line:84%
there's one thing that comes
back as far as I'm concerned.

00:02:27.150 --> 00:02:31.540 align:middle line:84%
And that is, but where is
there a place for the greater

00:02:31.540 --> 00:02:33.350 align:middle line:84%
field of intelligence,
for the greater

00:02:33.350 --> 00:02:39.220 align:middle line:84%
mind, the nonphysical mind which
is intuition, which is soul,

00:02:39.220 --> 00:02:40.200 align:middle line:90%
which is spirit?

00:02:40.200 --> 00:02:41.240 align:middle line:90%
How does that factor in?

00:02:41.240 --> 00:02:43.640 align:middle line:84%
And that's going to become the
nature of this conversation.

00:02:43.640 --> 00:02:44.880 align:middle line:84%
>>BELITSOS: Yeah, that's
where we want to go,

00:02:44.880 --> 00:02:46.796 align:middle line:84%
because most of the
people that are doing this

00:02:46.796 --> 00:02:48.110 align:middle line:90%
are materialists.

00:02:48.110 --> 00:02:49.300 align:middle line:90%
They're reductionists.

00:02:49.300 --> 00:02:52.900 align:middle line:84%
They don't really understand
consciousness the way we do.

00:02:52.900 --> 00:02:55.940 align:middle line:84%
They see consciousness as an
epiphenomenon of the brain.

00:02:55.940 --> 00:02:58.330 align:middle line:84%
So if you can get
the brain just right,

00:02:58.330 --> 00:03:00.680 align:middle line:84%
then you can generate
consciousness.

00:03:00.680 --> 00:03:03.130 align:middle line:84%
So they think that if the
software is good enough,

00:03:03.130 --> 00:03:05.680 align:middle line:84%
then they'll generate
a self-aware being.

00:03:05.680 --> 00:03:07.630 align:middle line:84%
I mean, they're really
serious about it too.

00:03:07.630 --> 00:03:09.963 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Is that what the
European Commission is hoping

00:03:09.963 --> 00:03:12.730 align:middle line:84%
to find at the end of
spending a billion dollars

00:03:12.730 --> 00:03:13.910 align:middle line:90%
on their search? [LAUGHS]

00:03:13.910 --> 00:03:15.993 align:middle line:84%
>>BELITSOS: I don't know
if that's in their public

00:03:15.993 --> 00:03:17.670 align:middle line:84%
document, but it's
probably in the--

00:03:17.670 --> 00:03:19.295 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: The search
for consciousness.

00:03:19.295 --> 00:03:23.340 align:middle line:90%


00:03:23.340 --> 00:03:25.620 align:middle line:84%
We have many places to
go in this discussion,

00:03:25.620 --> 00:03:28.710 align:middle line:84%
and because you have a very
broad and unique viewpoint

00:03:28.710 --> 00:03:32.310 align:middle line:84%
on it, I'm going to ask you when
the point comes to just launch

00:03:32.310 --> 00:03:33.830 align:middle line:84%
into what you feel
is appropriate

00:03:33.830 --> 00:03:35.760 align:middle line:84%
and not necessarily
just have to stick

00:03:35.760 --> 00:03:37.010 align:middle line:90%
with what I'm throwing at you.

00:03:37.010 --> 00:03:38.660 align:middle line:84%
And one of the things
we'll start with

00:03:38.660 --> 00:03:41.239 align:middle line:84%
is Ted Peters had something--
I've interviewed Ted Peters.

00:03:41.239 --> 00:03:43.030 align:middle line:84%
He had a little bit to
say on this subject.

00:03:43.030 --> 00:03:44.710 align:middle line:84%
And I'll refer
any of our viewers

00:03:44.710 --> 00:03:48.140 align:middle line:84%
also over to watch my interview
with Ted Peters later.

00:03:48.140 --> 00:03:50.770 align:middle line:10%
But what did he have to
say about it, and why

00:03:50.770 --> 00:03:51.680 align:middle line:10%
was it significant?

00:03:51.680 --> 00:03:54.290 align:middle line:10%
>>BELITSOS: Ted is an
amazing theologian.

00:03:54.290 --> 00:03:56.210 align:middle line:84%
I actually studied
with him when I

00:03:56.210 --> 00:03:58.260 align:middle line:84%
was a theological
student at Berkeley,

00:03:58.260 --> 00:03:59.410 align:middle line:90%
and so I got to know him.

00:03:59.410 --> 00:04:02.470 align:middle line:84%
And he and I
disagreed, actually,

00:04:02.470 --> 00:04:06.045 align:middle line:84%
about me doing a dissertation
on "The Urantia Book."

00:04:06.045 --> 00:04:07.670 align:middle line:84%
So that's how I got
to know Ted Peters.

00:04:07.670 --> 00:04:09.500 align:middle line:90%
That was 25 years ago.

00:04:09.500 --> 00:04:10.340 align:middle line:90%
So I branched out.

00:04:10.340 --> 00:04:12.600 align:middle line:84%
I stopped being an
academic after that.

00:04:12.600 --> 00:04:14.230 align:middle line:90%
But I followed Ted's career.

00:04:14.230 --> 00:04:17.050 align:middle line:84%
Ted is amazing because
he loves to track

00:04:17.050 --> 00:04:21.250 align:middle line:84%
on contemporary, religious,
cultish movements.

00:04:21.250 --> 00:04:24.190 align:middle line:84%
And he considers transhumanism
to be like a cult.

00:04:24.190 --> 00:04:27.600 align:middle line:84%
It's like a religion that has
characteristics of any cult,

00:04:27.600 --> 00:04:31.440 align:middle line:84%
except they don't have a central
guru that they worship and they

00:04:31.440 --> 00:04:33.856 align:middle line:84%
don't have a deity,
exactly, that they worship.

00:04:33.856 --> 00:04:34.730 align:middle line:90%
But other than that--

00:04:34.730 --> 00:04:36.396 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: But one of
the main cathedrals

00:04:36.396 --> 00:04:37.810 align:middle line:90%
is MIT from what I understand.

00:04:37.810 --> 00:04:38.768 align:middle line:90%
>>BELITSOS: Yeah, yeah.

00:04:38.768 --> 00:04:40.080 align:middle line:90%
And other such stuff.

00:04:40.080 --> 00:04:43.840 align:middle line:10%
And certainly in the west coast,
the Singularity University

00:04:43.840 --> 00:04:48.781 align:middle line:10%
founded by Kurzweil, that's
where the high priests are.

00:04:48.781 --> 00:04:50.280 align:middle line:10%
I don't know if
you've covered that.

00:04:50.280 --> 00:04:51.140 align:middle line:10%
>>REGINA: I have not yet.

00:04:51.140 --> 00:04:52.380 align:middle line:10%
>>BELITSOS: They're amazing.

00:04:52.380 --> 00:04:53.610 align:middle line:10%
Really, it's impressive.

00:04:53.610 --> 00:04:55.710 align:middle line:10%
And they've got a lot of money.

00:04:55.710 --> 00:05:00.872 align:middle line:84%
Kurzweil then was
moved over to Google.

00:05:00.872 --> 00:05:01.580 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: I know.

00:05:01.580 --> 00:05:04.442 align:middle line:84%
When I saw that, that
concerned me a little bit.

00:05:04.442 --> 00:05:05.650 align:middle line:90%
>>BELITSOS: I would be, yeah.

00:05:05.650 --> 00:05:09.430 align:middle line:84%
Because Kurzweil is talking
about the reductionist model,

00:05:09.430 --> 00:05:13.240 align:middle line:84%
a material version of
transhumanism purely,

00:05:13.240 --> 00:05:15.410 align:middle line:84%
meaning these guys
are atheists and they

00:05:15.410 --> 00:05:18.680 align:middle line:84%
don't believe in consciousness
as a thing in itself.

00:05:18.680 --> 00:05:22.920 align:middle line:84%
So here is Google with unlimited
funding-- unlimited funding--

00:05:22.920 --> 00:05:24.940 align:middle line:84%
to go all the way
down the rabbit hole

00:05:24.940 --> 00:05:26.430 align:middle line:90%
into transhumanist experiments.

00:05:26.430 --> 00:05:30.440 align:middle line:10%
>>REGINA: What's interesting is
the wives of the Google boys,

00:05:30.440 --> 00:05:32.100 align:middle line:10%
they are both geneticists.

00:05:32.100 --> 00:05:36.170 align:middle line:84%
They're the ones that started
23andMe, which gets people

00:05:36.170 --> 00:05:39.080 align:middle line:84%
around the world to opt
in and pay for having

00:05:39.080 --> 00:05:42.900 align:middle line:90%
their genetics mapped.

00:05:42.900 --> 00:05:47.210 align:middle line:84%
The idea is to see what
might be a propensity

00:05:47.210 --> 00:05:50.630 align:middle line:84%
for a particular kind of
ailment within that bloodline.

00:05:50.630 --> 00:05:52.170 align:middle line:90%
That's not how I view it.

00:05:52.170 --> 00:05:54.910 align:middle line:84%
It's interesting because
they married roughly

00:05:54.910 --> 00:05:55.830 align:middle line:90%
at the same time.

00:05:55.830 --> 00:05:57.560 align:middle line:90%
Both the women are geneticists.

00:05:57.560 --> 00:05:58.900 align:middle line:90%
Kurzweil's coming into this.

00:05:58.900 --> 00:06:01.640 align:middle line:84%
It looks like it's a
little larger story to me.

00:06:01.640 --> 00:06:02.890 align:middle line:90%
>>BELITSOS: It's a huge story.

00:06:02.890 --> 00:06:04.960 align:middle line:84%
And the thing about
it, it's got money.

00:06:04.960 --> 00:06:06.330 align:middle line:90%
It's got money backing it.

00:06:06.330 --> 00:06:08.840 align:middle line:84%
And those of us doing
what we do don't

00:06:08.840 --> 00:06:11.500 align:middle line:84%
have that kind of funding to do
the research on consciousness,

00:06:11.500 --> 00:06:14.640 align:middle line:84%
for example, to show a
different paradigm from what

00:06:14.640 --> 00:06:16.220 align:middle line:90%
these guys are doing.

00:06:16.220 --> 00:06:19.454 align:middle line:84%
But actually, I
have faith that--

00:06:19.454 --> 00:06:21.120 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Consciousness
will transcend--

00:06:21.120 --> 00:06:23.203 align:middle line:84%
>>BELITSOS: It will converge,
because the research

00:06:23.203 --> 00:06:25.966 align:middle line:84%
in consciousness studies
is very compelling.

00:06:25.966 --> 00:06:28.090 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: OK, so let's talk
about Ted Peters again.

00:06:28.090 --> 00:06:29.760 align:middle line:84%
That's where we
were starting to go.

00:06:29.760 --> 00:06:30.530 align:middle line:84%
>>BELITSOS: Yeah,
coming back to Ted.

00:06:30.530 --> 00:06:31.946 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: What did
he have to say?

00:06:31.946 --> 00:06:34.056 align:middle line:84%
>>BELITSOS: Well,
theologically, we

00:06:34.056 --> 00:06:35.930 align:middle line:84%
have established already
in this conversation

00:06:35.930 --> 00:06:38.180 align:middle line:84%
that these guys are
materialists and reductionists.

00:06:38.180 --> 00:06:40.760 align:middle line:84%
And they also do not have an
evolutionary picture of things.

00:06:40.760 --> 00:06:44.720 align:middle line:84%
So Ted is trying to say,
listen, current state of the art

00:06:44.720 --> 00:06:47.910 align:middle line:84%
paradigm in theology
is evolutionary.

00:06:47.910 --> 00:06:52.310 align:middle line:84%
And there's a what we call
panentheistic philosophy,

00:06:52.310 --> 00:06:54.420 align:middle line:84%
theology, which is
there is a god here,

00:06:54.420 --> 00:06:57.390 align:middle line:84%
but the god is not
the Old Testament god.

00:06:57.390 --> 00:07:01.550 align:middle line:84%
There's a god who is creator
and sets evolution into motion

00:07:01.550 --> 00:07:05.180 align:middle line:84%
over billions of years,
and so this long stretch

00:07:05.180 --> 00:07:10.990 align:middle line:84%
of the incarnation of
spirit into nature.

00:07:10.990 --> 00:07:13.770 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And I remember a
few years ago interviewing

00:07:13.770 --> 00:07:15.370 align:middle line:84%
Bernard Haisch over
this, because he's

00:07:15.370 --> 00:07:17.100 align:middle line:84%
one of the people--
he's a physicist.

00:07:17.100 --> 00:07:19.535 align:middle line:84%
And again, this is where
people like Peters and Haisch

00:07:19.535 --> 00:07:23.120 align:middle line:84%
and those are coming together
to support this common viewpoint

00:07:23.120 --> 00:07:23.810 align:middle line:90%
now.

00:07:23.810 --> 00:07:26.000 align:middle line:84%
>>BELITSOS: Yeah, the
evolutionary theory

00:07:26.000 --> 00:07:29.270 align:middle line:84%
is deep, broad, and
you can't ignore it.

00:07:29.270 --> 00:07:31.760 align:middle line:84%
So what we're trying
to do, those of us

00:07:31.760 --> 00:07:33.780 align:middle line:84%
that are critics
of transhumanism,

00:07:33.780 --> 00:07:36.910 align:middle line:84%
is to bring this other
theoretical perspective

00:07:36.910 --> 00:07:40.180 align:middle line:84%
into a narrow box,
which is, oh, we're

00:07:40.180 --> 00:07:42.060 align:middle line:90%
just MIT technology people.

00:07:42.060 --> 00:07:45.580 align:middle line:84%
We're going to emulate the
brain and the human organs

00:07:45.580 --> 00:07:46.857 align:middle line:90%
and then create a robot.

00:07:46.857 --> 00:07:48.440 align:middle line:84%
But we don't know
what it's all about.

00:07:48.440 --> 00:07:49.606 align:middle line:90%
We don't know what it's for.

00:07:49.606 --> 00:07:52.560 align:middle line:84%
We're just being funded in
order to create some technology

00:07:52.560 --> 00:07:55.614 align:middle line:90%
that'll make somebody money.

00:07:55.614 --> 00:07:57.280 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Right,
because toward what end

00:07:57.280 --> 00:07:58.363 align:middle line:90%
is not really being asked.

00:07:58.363 --> 00:08:00.520 align:middle line:84%
>>BELITSOS: And who
benefits from this?

00:08:00.520 --> 00:08:03.890 align:middle line:84%
Because all of this
is so privatized now.

00:08:03.890 --> 00:08:06.520 align:middle line:84%
There's European
Commission, which is public.

00:08:06.520 --> 00:08:08.410 align:middle line:90%
You know, they're funding this.

00:08:08.410 --> 00:08:11.860 align:middle line:84%
And Obama's administration
has given money also

00:08:11.860 --> 00:08:15.520 align:middle line:84%
to brain research for people
who are transhumanists as well.

00:08:15.520 --> 00:08:17.560 align:middle line:84%
So there's public money,
but these governments

00:08:17.560 --> 00:08:18.809 align:middle line:90%
are dominated by corporations.

00:08:18.809 --> 00:08:21.367 align:middle line:90%


00:08:21.367 --> 00:08:23.950 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So it's always follow
the money trail, even in this.

00:08:23.950 --> 00:08:25.660 align:middle line:84%
Is it appropriate
to bring up the work

00:08:25.660 --> 00:08:27.142 align:middle line:90%
of Ted Chu at this point?

00:08:27.142 --> 00:08:27.850 align:middle line:90%
>>BELITSOS: Yeah.

00:08:27.850 --> 00:08:28.940 align:middle line:90%
Let's bring Ted into this.

00:08:28.940 --> 00:08:32.960 align:middle line:84%
Ted is a genius, I think,
who brought a book to me

00:08:32.960 --> 00:08:35.929 align:middle line:90%
about this subject.

00:08:35.929 --> 00:08:38.070 align:middle line:84%
I actually was a journalist,
covered Silicon Valley

00:08:38.070 --> 00:08:40.879 align:middle line:84%
in the 1980s, so I'm
familiar with the mentality

00:08:40.879 --> 00:08:42.299 align:middle line:90%
of these people.

00:08:42.299 --> 00:08:47.990 align:middle line:84%
And Ted is an economist who
was chief economist of General

00:08:47.990 --> 00:08:50.470 align:middle line:84%
Motors, so he had a
pretty interesting job,

00:08:50.470 --> 00:08:52.620 align:middle line:84%
and his hobby is to
study transhumanism.

00:08:52.620 --> 00:08:55.200 align:middle line:84%
And for 20 years, he
was looking at this.

00:08:55.200 --> 00:08:58.900 align:middle line:84%
But he brings a spiritual and
consciousness based approach

00:08:58.900 --> 00:08:59.570 align:middle line:90%
to this.

00:08:59.570 --> 00:09:01.589 align:middle line:84%
So here's this guy's
a genius in economics.

00:09:01.589 --> 00:09:03.130 align:middle line:84%
He's got this other
career where he's

00:09:03.130 --> 00:09:06.320 align:middle line:84%
bringing this paradigm
of evolutionary theory

00:09:06.320 --> 00:09:08.980 align:middle line:84%
and consciousness
studies and theology

00:09:08.980 --> 00:09:11.150 align:middle line:84%
to transhumanism--
or the technology--

00:09:11.150 --> 00:09:12.707 align:middle line:90%
and also the economics of this.

00:09:12.707 --> 00:09:14.290 align:middle line:84%
So he's got the whole
thing converging

00:09:14.290 --> 00:09:17.410 align:middle line:84%
in his new book, which
I published last year.

00:09:17.410 --> 00:09:20.090 align:middle line:84%
What is the human
purpose in this activity?

00:09:20.090 --> 00:09:23.110 align:middle line:84%
It's not discussed enough
among technologists.

00:09:23.110 --> 00:09:25.650 align:middle line:84%
They don't have the
education, and really,

00:09:25.650 --> 00:09:26.950 align:middle line:90%
the context for this.

00:09:26.950 --> 00:09:28.480 align:middle line:84%
So he's going to
bring the context.

00:09:28.480 --> 00:09:31.850 align:middle line:84%
So he's doing a study of all
the world's wisdom traditions.

00:09:31.850 --> 00:09:34.740 align:middle line:84%
And he's finding there that
they all have the same impulse

00:09:34.740 --> 00:09:36.390 align:middle line:84%
that the transhumanists
do, which

00:09:36.390 --> 00:09:39.180 align:middle line:90%
is human self-transcendence.

00:09:39.180 --> 00:09:41.470 align:middle line:84%
We're all looking for
a better life, right?

00:09:41.470 --> 00:09:44.080 align:middle line:84%
But I mean, some of us get
really radical about it.

00:09:44.080 --> 00:09:46.630 align:middle line:84%
So transhumanists are
really radical about it.

00:09:46.630 --> 00:09:50.415 align:middle line:84%
But also, people who are
advanced practitioners

00:09:50.415 --> 00:09:55.230 align:middle line:84%
of spiritual systems
are also radical.

00:09:55.230 --> 00:09:57.420 align:middle line:84%
Monks are radical,
and they're trying

00:09:57.420 --> 00:10:00.410 align:middle line:84%
to get higher capacities through
prayer, through meditation,

00:10:00.410 --> 00:10:01.500 align:middle line:90%
through service.

00:10:01.500 --> 00:10:03.820 align:middle line:84%
So he's saying, well, why
is this any different?

00:10:03.820 --> 00:10:07.410 align:middle line:84%
It's just that now we've
augmented it with technology.

00:10:07.410 --> 00:10:09.140 align:middle line:84%
So we have much
more power, and we

00:10:09.140 --> 00:10:12.120 align:middle line:84%
can use these tools
to enhance anything.

00:10:12.120 --> 00:10:14.210 align:middle line:84%
We can enhance anything
with these tools.

00:10:14.210 --> 00:10:16.090 align:middle line:90%
We can change our genetics.

00:10:16.090 --> 00:10:20.380 align:middle line:84%
We can completely redo
the genome, in theory,

00:10:20.380 --> 00:10:24.890 align:middle line:84%
so we could create humans who
have much better genetics.

00:10:24.890 --> 00:10:26.590 align:middle line:84%
But it's really
the same impulse.

00:10:26.590 --> 00:10:30.410 align:middle line:84%
Again, it's taking
nature and enhancing

00:10:30.410 --> 00:10:33.540 align:middle line:84%
it using nature's methods,
and one of the methods

00:10:33.540 --> 00:10:36.710 align:middle line:90%
is humans researching nature.

00:10:36.710 --> 00:10:38.930 align:middle line:84%
That's all recursive
in that way.

00:10:38.930 --> 00:10:41.250 align:middle line:84%
So Ted has done, I
think, a master work

00:10:41.250 --> 00:10:44.580 align:middle line:84%
that's been widely reviewed
as being the first time anyone

00:10:44.580 --> 00:10:48.170 align:middle line:84%
brought the wisdom traditions
in the broadest sense

00:10:48.170 --> 00:10:52.120 align:middle line:84%
and evolutionary theory and
other theory and context

00:10:52.120 --> 00:10:54.580 align:middle line:90%
to the transhumanism project.

00:10:54.580 --> 00:10:57.690 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: OK, so that
brings us to the body

00:10:57.690 --> 00:10:59.860 align:middle line:84%
of this topic, which
is to now start

00:10:59.860 --> 00:11:03.750 align:middle line:84%
tracing back the
notion of transhumanism

00:11:03.750 --> 00:11:05.320 align:middle line:90%
into ancient times.

00:11:05.320 --> 00:11:09.210 align:middle line:84%
And this starts coming
up in the Urantia work,

00:11:09.210 --> 00:11:14.060 align:middle line:84%
which you've spent the last
20 years or so working with.

00:11:14.060 --> 00:11:18.020 align:middle line:84%
So let's start launching into
from the Urantia point of view,

00:11:18.020 --> 00:11:20.450 align:middle line:84%
bring in Zecharia
Sitchin's work,

00:11:20.450 --> 00:11:22.390 align:middle line:84%
because the time
frames are overlaying,

00:11:22.390 --> 00:11:27.040 align:middle line:84%
and we'll begin a dialogue
about how far this transhuman

00:11:27.040 --> 00:11:31.830 align:middle line:84%
interventionism goes,
how far back it goes.

00:11:31.830 --> 00:11:34.260 align:middle line:84%
>>BELITSOS: To the very
beginning of human history.

00:11:34.260 --> 00:11:36.960 align:middle line:84%
And so again, the
framing we've given this

00:11:36.960 --> 00:11:40.920 align:middle line:84%
is that there's this
self-transcending impulse.

00:11:40.920 --> 00:11:44.650 align:middle line:84%
It is within us, but it
also comes from outside.

00:11:44.650 --> 00:11:48.620 align:middle line:84%
So the thesis here is
that off planet influences

00:11:48.620 --> 00:11:51.880 align:middle line:84%
have the same impulse,
which is self-transcendence.

00:11:51.880 --> 00:11:55.040 align:middle line:84%
So evolution itself
is self-transcending.

00:11:55.040 --> 00:11:59.380 align:middle line:84%
So the big bang, if you believe
in the big bang, is an origin.

00:11:59.380 --> 00:12:03.800 align:middle line:84%
But there's self-transcending
stages of evolution.

00:12:03.800 --> 00:12:05.540 align:middle line:84%
And finally, we get
galaxies, and that's

00:12:05.540 --> 00:12:07.790 align:middle line:90%
a self-transcending stage.

00:12:07.790 --> 00:12:10.440 align:middle line:84%
It's autopoiesis, as
the scientists call it.

00:12:10.440 --> 00:12:11.780 align:middle line:90%
it's just generating itself.

00:12:11.780 --> 00:12:13.960 align:middle line:84%
And so you get to a
platform when you now

00:12:13.960 --> 00:12:16.640 align:middle line:84%
have galaxies and suns, and
the suns throw off planets,

00:12:16.640 --> 00:12:18.790 align:middle line:84%
and planets then
have life, and then

00:12:18.790 --> 00:12:20.090 align:middle line:90%
life is a whole new innovation.

00:12:20.090 --> 00:12:23.772 align:middle line:84%
So it's always novelty,
always novelty.

00:12:23.772 --> 00:12:25.980 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: The difference is
you said self-generating.

00:12:25.980 --> 00:12:27.355 align:middle line:84%
But we're talking
about something

00:12:27.355 --> 00:12:28.920 align:middle line:84%
that has an
intervention involved,

00:12:28.920 --> 00:12:30.460 align:middle line:90%
which is not self-generating.

00:12:30.460 --> 00:12:31.918 align:middle line:84%
>>BELITSOS: Right,
and this is what

00:12:31.918 --> 00:12:36.520 align:middle line:84%
I call the dance of
evolution and intervention.

00:12:36.520 --> 00:12:40.660 align:middle line:10%
So this is the
theory of evolution

00:12:40.660 --> 00:12:42.370 align:middle line:10%
you get from the
Urantia revelation.

00:12:42.370 --> 00:12:45.880 align:middle line:10%
The Urantia revelation says,
yes, there is evolution.

00:12:45.880 --> 00:12:51.450 align:middle line:10%
Nature has its own
autopoiesis built in.

00:12:51.450 --> 00:12:54.660 align:middle line:84%
You don't need to think that
God is doing everything,

00:12:54.660 --> 00:12:56.560 align:middle line:90%
which fundamentalists do.

00:12:56.560 --> 00:12:57.850 align:middle line:90%
They can't accept evolution.

00:12:57.850 --> 00:12:59.430 align:middle line:90%
They're creationists.

00:12:59.430 --> 00:13:01.780 align:middle line:84%
God sets it in
motion, so to speak,

00:13:01.780 --> 00:13:02.950 align:middle line:90%
so it's self-transcending.

00:13:02.950 --> 00:13:04.530 align:middle line:84%
But then there's
a point at which

00:13:04.530 --> 00:13:06.150 align:middle line:90%
there needs to be intervention.

00:13:06.150 --> 00:13:09.100 align:middle line:84%
So this is what you might
call interventionism,

00:13:09.100 --> 00:13:12.020 align:middle line:84%
but it's balanced
with evolutionism.

00:13:12.020 --> 00:13:14.890 align:middle line:84%
And some people call
it intelligent design.

00:13:14.890 --> 00:13:17.370 align:middle line:84%
So there's set in
motion and then

00:13:17.370 --> 00:13:19.990 align:middle line:84%
the designer comes
in and tweaks it.

00:13:19.990 --> 00:13:23.389 align:middle line:84%
And that's how we do
things with our devices.

00:13:23.389 --> 00:13:24.680 align:middle line:90%
And television is the same way.

00:13:24.680 --> 00:13:26.464 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Animal
husbandry, botany,

00:13:26.464 --> 00:13:27.630 align:middle line:90%
we're doing it all the time.

00:13:27.630 --> 00:13:29.650 align:middle line:84%
>>BELITSOS: Yeah,
we're doing genetics,

00:13:29.650 --> 00:13:31.380 align:middle line:84%
and we're intervening
and changing.

00:13:31.380 --> 00:13:34.660 align:middle line:84%
Or if you're a cattle
rancher, and you're

00:13:34.660 --> 00:13:37.580 align:middle line:84%
breeding the
proper-- so why would

00:13:37.580 --> 00:13:39.480 align:middle line:90%
the universe be any different?

00:13:39.480 --> 00:13:42.490 align:middle line:84%
And if you have children,
you let your children play.

00:13:42.490 --> 00:13:44.317 align:middle line:90%
You don't tell them how to play.

00:13:44.317 --> 00:13:45.650 align:middle line:90%
You don't dictate how they play.

00:13:45.650 --> 00:13:48.050 align:middle line:84%
They play, but now and then,
you come in and you say, no, no,

00:13:48.050 --> 00:13:48.550 align:middle line:90%
no.

00:13:48.550 --> 00:13:52.545 align:middle line:84%
Let's come back to the sandbox
and not fight each other

00:13:52.545 --> 00:13:53.420 align:middle line:90%
and get back to play.

00:13:53.420 --> 00:13:54.580 align:middle line:90%
Then you back off again.

00:13:54.580 --> 00:13:56.624 align:middle line:84%
So "The Urantia Book"
has what I think

00:13:56.624 --> 00:13:58.290 align:middle line:84%
is a common sense
picture of this, which

00:13:58.290 --> 00:14:01.400 align:middle line:84%
is evolution set in to
motion, and then there's

00:14:01.400 --> 00:14:03.290 align:middle line:90%
a certain plateau effect.

00:14:03.290 --> 00:14:06.270 align:middle line:84%
When you hit that
plateau, then off planet

00:14:06.270 --> 00:14:12.790 align:middle line:84%
comes in and offers what I call
gifts, or blessings, really.

00:14:12.790 --> 00:14:16.230 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Assuming it's being
done through proper intention

00:14:16.230 --> 00:14:17.720 align:middle line:90%
and high ethics.

00:14:17.720 --> 00:14:19.980 align:middle line:84%
And we're going to get into
where maybe that wasn't

00:14:19.980 --> 00:14:21.290 align:middle line:90%
the case also.

00:14:21.290 --> 00:14:25.205 align:middle line:84%
I mean, ideally, that is how
it would work and has worked.

00:14:25.205 --> 00:14:26.330 align:middle line:90%
>>BELITSOS: And has worked.

00:14:26.330 --> 00:14:28.020 align:middle line:84%
And what I like
about "The Urantia

00:14:28.020 --> 00:14:30.660 align:middle line:84%
Book," among many
things, is that it

00:14:30.660 --> 00:14:33.690 align:middle line:84%
says there are other planets
and it tells you about them,

00:14:33.690 --> 00:14:36.130 align:middle line:84%
and they're inhabited and
they have humans like us.

00:14:36.130 --> 00:14:37.756 align:middle line:84%
And there's not
millions or billions,

00:14:37.756 --> 00:14:39.380 align:middle line:84%
there's trillions of
inhabited planets.

00:14:39.380 --> 00:14:43.390 align:middle line:84%
And so they have the
record of evolution

00:14:43.390 --> 00:14:44.520 align:middle line:90%
of all these other planets.

00:14:44.520 --> 00:14:46.495 align:middle line:84%
And they're saying,
this is how we do it,

00:14:46.495 --> 00:14:48.760 align:middle line:90%
we, the celestial host.

00:14:48.760 --> 00:14:52.460 align:middle line:84%
This is how we sponsor
you into your planet.

00:14:52.460 --> 00:14:57.770 align:middle line:84%
Plant life, back off, let
you evolve, then come in

00:14:57.770 --> 00:14:58.530 align:middle line:90%
and we enhance.

00:14:58.530 --> 00:15:02.530 align:middle line:84%
And every time they are
coming in, they're benign.

00:15:02.530 --> 00:15:06.220 align:middle line:84%
They're deities, or they're
what we might call demigods,

00:15:06.220 --> 00:15:07.630 align:middle line:90%
coming in benign.

00:15:07.630 --> 00:15:10.140 align:middle line:84%
Now we have an exceptional
cases in the case

00:15:10.140 --> 00:15:12.590 align:middle line:84%
of Earth or Urantia,
which is what

00:15:12.590 --> 00:15:14.620 align:middle line:84%
they say is the name
of our planet, Urantia.

00:15:14.620 --> 00:15:15.650 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: It's atypical.

00:15:15.650 --> 00:15:17.310 align:middle line:90%
>>BELITSOS: It's atypical.

00:15:17.310 --> 00:15:19.460 align:middle line:84%
And it's a one in
a million situation

00:15:19.460 --> 00:15:24.904 align:middle line:84%
where the celestial host and
the local universe went dark.

00:15:24.904 --> 00:15:27.070 align:middle line:84%
So people say, well, how
could that possibly happen?

00:15:27.070 --> 00:15:27.694 align:middle line:90%
They're angels.

00:15:27.694 --> 00:15:29.770 align:middle line:90%
Angels are benign by definition.

00:15:29.770 --> 00:15:33.060 align:middle line:84%
Well, angels have free
will like humans do.

00:15:33.060 --> 00:15:35.052 align:middle line:84%
It's limited free will,
but they're like us.

00:15:35.052 --> 00:15:36.885 align:middle line:84%
They're not evolving
the way we do, exactly.

00:15:36.885 --> 00:15:40.810 align:middle line:84%
But built into the
system, so to speak,

00:15:40.810 --> 00:15:45.600 align:middle line:84%
is the ability for angels to
disagree with the program.

00:15:45.600 --> 00:15:49.010 align:middle line:84%
And it's a pretty
minor possibility,

00:15:49.010 --> 00:15:50.500 align:middle line:84%
but it's there
for a good reason,

00:15:50.500 --> 00:15:53.510 align:middle line:84%
because they have to
choose to do what they do.

00:15:53.510 --> 00:15:54.890 align:middle line:90%
They're not robots.

00:15:54.890 --> 00:15:56.390 align:middle line:84%
So the transhumanists
want to create

00:15:56.390 --> 00:15:58.390 align:middle line:90%
robots that are programmed.

00:15:58.390 --> 00:15:59.930 align:middle line:90%
But angels are not robots.

00:15:59.930 --> 00:16:01.080 align:middle line:90%
They have freedom.

00:16:01.080 --> 00:16:06.590 align:middle line:84%
So it is possible, in our case,
our angelic host went dark.

00:16:06.590 --> 00:16:07.820 align:middle line:90%
So it's very hard to stomach.

00:16:07.820 --> 00:16:09.800 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Now let's
go to Earth's history.

00:16:09.800 --> 00:16:13.540 align:middle line:84%
According to Urantia, billions
of years for single cell life

00:16:13.540 --> 00:16:16.370 align:middle line:90%
forms to evolve, so to speak.

00:16:16.370 --> 00:16:16.890 align:middle line:90%
Right?

00:16:16.890 --> 00:16:18.348 align:middle line:84%
>>BELITSOS: So you
start-- and this

00:16:18.348 --> 00:16:21.270 align:middle line:84%
is conventional understanding
formed a billion years ago

00:16:21.270 --> 00:16:25.200 align:middle line:84%
or so-- there's the beginning
of life, single celled life.

00:16:25.200 --> 00:16:28.262 align:middle line:84%
And so this evolves, and you
get this in any textbook.

00:16:28.262 --> 00:16:29.970 align:middle line:84%
So "The Urantia Book"
says, first of all,

00:16:29.970 --> 00:16:33.650 align:middle line:84%
that life is planted
as a single cell.

00:16:33.650 --> 00:16:37.360 align:middle line:84%
They designed the cell
in celestial laboratories

00:16:37.360 --> 00:16:40.800 align:middle line:84%
according to the
characteristics of that planet.

00:16:40.800 --> 00:16:43.999 align:middle line:84%
So it's tweaked just
right for your atmosphere,

00:16:43.999 --> 00:16:45.040 align:middle line:90%
for what's on the planet.

00:16:45.040 --> 00:16:48.190 align:middle line:84%
So then they planted--
"they" are these beings that

00:16:48.190 --> 00:16:51.240 align:middle line:84%
have the job of doing it--
they actually have labs,

00:16:51.240 --> 00:16:53.860 align:middle line:84%
then they carry it, and
they're called life carriers.

00:16:53.860 --> 00:16:55.670 align:middle line:84%
So the life carriers
planted life.

00:16:55.670 --> 00:16:57.336 align:middle line:84%
Because this gets you
around the problem

00:16:57.336 --> 00:17:01.630 align:middle line:84%
of how do you explain life
emerging out of rocks?

00:17:01.630 --> 00:17:03.030 align:middle line:90%
They just can't explain it.

00:17:03.030 --> 00:17:04.550 align:middle line:90%
Nobody has an explanation.

00:17:04.550 --> 00:17:07.670 align:middle line:84%
So they have the so-called
Panspermia theory

00:17:07.670 --> 00:17:09.780 align:middle line:84%
from, I think it
was Crick, the guy

00:17:09.780 --> 00:17:13.190 align:middle line:84%
who was one of the two
innovators that discovered DNA.

00:17:13.190 --> 00:17:15.800 align:middle line:84%
And somewhere there has
to be a seeding coming

00:17:15.800 --> 00:17:17.380 align:middle line:90%
from some other place.

00:17:17.380 --> 00:17:20.030 align:middle line:84%
So a pretty distinguished
scientist that says this.

00:17:20.030 --> 00:17:21.990 align:middle line:84%
So it's the same idea
here, is that they're

00:17:21.990 --> 00:17:23.960 align:middle line:90%
actual beings that do this.

00:17:23.960 --> 00:17:24.923 align:middle line:90%
They're off planet.

00:17:24.923 --> 00:17:25.839 align:middle line:90%
They come, they plant.

00:17:25.839 --> 00:17:29.960 align:middle line:84%
So life then evolves, they
back off, watch this happen,

00:17:29.960 --> 00:17:32.880 align:middle line:84%
and they've done their job
well because the DNA is

00:17:32.880 --> 00:17:35.370 align:middle line:90%
designed so that it will work.

00:17:35.370 --> 00:17:37.950 align:middle line:84%
And so you go through
all the different stages

00:17:37.950 --> 00:17:39.030 align:middle line:90%
until you get hominids.

00:17:39.030 --> 00:17:42.260 align:middle line:84%
And so hominids come
four billion years later.

00:17:42.260 --> 00:17:45.360 align:middle line:84%
So these are very
patient beings.

00:17:45.360 --> 00:17:47.200 align:middle line:90%
Their forbearance is amazing.

00:17:47.200 --> 00:17:49.900 align:middle line:84%
So once we get to the
point of hominids,

00:17:49.900 --> 00:17:52.700 align:middle line:84%
then they're really watching
closely until we get to a point

00:17:52.700 --> 00:17:55.830 align:middle line:84%
that the hominids
become Homo erectus.

00:17:55.830 --> 00:18:01.070 align:middle line:84%
And at that point, they're
ready for the first intervention

00:18:01.070 --> 00:18:03.420 align:middle line:84%
which actually we
didn't talk yet, but--

00:18:03.420 --> 00:18:05.000 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: No, I
would like to, yes.

00:18:05.000 --> 00:18:06.250 align:middle line:90%
>>BELITSOS: It's actually two.

00:18:06.250 --> 00:18:09.870 align:middle line:84%
One is the ability
of humans to receive

00:18:09.870 --> 00:18:13.820 align:middle line:84%
inner light that is
in a dwelling spirit

00:18:13.820 --> 00:18:16.290 align:middle line:90%
into them, into their mind.

00:18:16.290 --> 00:18:18.630 align:middle line:84%
And so that's
background for this.

00:18:18.630 --> 00:18:22.860 align:middle line:84%
And so there's a guiding
spirit in each human,

00:18:22.860 --> 00:18:24.570 align:middle line:90%
but not all humans.

00:18:24.570 --> 00:18:27.300 align:middle line:84%
So that's the first off
planet, but it's very subtle,

00:18:27.300 --> 00:18:29.330 align:middle line:90%
quiet intervention.

00:18:29.330 --> 00:18:31.676 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: What is that
called in Urantia terms?

00:18:31.676 --> 00:18:33.550 align:middle line:84%
>>BELITSOS: It's called
the thought adjuster.

00:18:33.550 --> 00:18:34.060 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: The thought adjuster.

00:18:34.060 --> 00:18:34.300 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:18:34.300 --> 00:18:35.883 align:middle line:84%
>>BELITSOS: It's a
non-technical term.

00:18:35.883 --> 00:18:39.140 align:middle line:84%
It's an entity that adjusts
your thoughts forward,

00:18:39.140 --> 00:18:40.800 align:middle line:90%
progressively.

00:18:40.800 --> 00:18:45.260 align:middle line:84%
But it's the same thing
as in Hinduism, the Atman,

00:18:45.260 --> 00:18:47.230 align:middle line:84%
which is a pure spark of
God within each of us.

00:18:47.230 --> 00:18:48.146 align:middle line:90%
So it's the same idea.

00:18:48.146 --> 00:18:51.110 align:middle line:84%
It's not the soul,
it's a different thing.

00:18:51.110 --> 00:18:53.940 align:middle line:84%
So once you get this,
you have some progress

00:18:53.940 --> 00:18:56.210 align:middle line:84%
until a point you
hit a plateau where

00:18:56.210 --> 00:18:57.780 align:middle line:90%
you need more intervention.

00:18:57.780 --> 00:19:00.265 align:middle line:84%
And this is the beginning,
and this is the unusual story

00:19:00.265 --> 00:19:02.720 align:middle line:84%
in "The Urantia Book," which
matches a little bit what

00:19:02.720 --> 00:19:05.610 align:middle line:90%
Sitchin says is the Anunnaki.

00:19:05.610 --> 00:19:09.870 align:middle line:84%
Anunnaki are exploitative
ETs, as everybody knows,

00:19:09.870 --> 00:19:13.360 align:middle line:84%
who he said came here
450,000 years ago.

00:19:13.360 --> 00:19:16.700 align:middle line:84%
But "The Urantia Book" says that
about half a million years ago,

00:19:16.700 --> 00:19:20.180 align:middle line:84%
pretty much the same time
line, came benign beings.

00:19:20.180 --> 00:19:22.630 align:middle line:84%
Not exactly
extraterrestrials, but they're

00:19:22.630 --> 00:19:26.180 align:middle line:84%
beings from a higher
world who incarnate.

00:19:26.180 --> 00:19:29.310 align:middle line:84%
And they come with the
first great intervention.

00:19:29.310 --> 00:19:31.030 align:middle line:84%
So this is an
intervention that's

00:19:31.030 --> 00:19:36.590 align:middle line:84%
going to take animal origin
beings, humans, we still have

00:19:36.590 --> 00:19:38.180 align:middle line:90%
animalistic characteristics.

00:19:38.180 --> 00:19:39.471 align:middle line:90%
They've come a really long way.

00:19:39.471 --> 00:19:40.680 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: And morality.

00:19:40.680 --> 00:19:41.940 align:middle line:90%
>>BELITSOS: And mortality.

00:19:41.940 --> 00:19:46.480 align:middle line:84%
They've come from pond
scum, so to speak, to humans

00:19:46.480 --> 00:19:48.410 align:middle line:90%
who can do some things.

00:19:48.410 --> 00:19:52.640 align:middle line:84%
They have some tools, and they
really don't have agriculture.

00:19:52.640 --> 00:19:53.730 align:middle line:90%
They're not even herders.

00:19:53.730 --> 00:19:54.930 align:middle line:90%
They're hunters, basically.

00:19:54.930 --> 00:19:55.971 align:middle line:90%
They're hunter gatherers.

00:19:55.971 --> 00:20:00.420 align:middle line:84%
So how do you get them
to move to the next level

00:20:00.420 --> 00:20:07.615 align:middle line:84%
of cultural evolution,
which would be herders,

00:20:07.615 --> 00:20:09.494 align:middle line:84%
and from herding to
get to agriculture?

00:20:09.494 --> 00:20:11.035 align:middle line:84%
Once you get to
agriculture, then you

00:20:11.035 --> 00:20:12.430 align:middle line:90%
can really have civilization.

00:20:12.430 --> 00:20:15.580 align:middle line:84%
But you can't build civilization
when everybody's out hunting.

00:20:15.580 --> 00:20:19.470 align:middle line:84%
So you need to have a
boost to get to that place,

00:20:19.470 --> 00:20:21.530 align:middle line:84%
to get to being
herders, which is

00:20:21.530 --> 00:20:27.990 align:middle line:84%
the depiction we have of
biblical figures like Abraham.

00:20:27.990 --> 00:20:30.980 align:middle line:84%
They're herders, and
they're also marauders.

00:20:30.980 --> 00:20:33.040 align:middle line:84%
And so you need to
get to that place

00:20:33.040 --> 00:20:37.230 align:middle line:84%
so that you can get to more
advanced tools and agriculture.

00:20:37.230 --> 00:20:39.891 align:middle line:84%
So they actually
send a delegation .

00:20:39.891 --> 00:20:41.390 align:middle line:84%
And according to
"The Urantia Book,"

00:20:41.390 --> 00:20:43.770 align:middle line:84%
every planet gets the
same kind of treatment.

00:20:43.770 --> 00:20:49.770 align:middle line:84%
They get a staff of
incarnate avatars.

00:20:49.770 --> 00:20:52.700 align:middle line:84%
Avatars is a term I use,
not in "The Urantia Book."

00:20:52.700 --> 00:20:54.760 align:middle line:84%
But it states that
they actually did

00:20:54.760 --> 00:20:59.030 align:middle line:84%
come here half a million years
ago into Mesopotamia, right

00:20:59.030 --> 00:21:02.250 align:middle line:84%
on the shores of
the Persian Gulf.

00:21:02.250 --> 00:21:05.160 align:middle line:84%
And there purportedly will
be archaeological evidence

00:21:05.160 --> 00:21:08.140 align:middle line:84%
of this, but it's
underwater there.

00:21:08.140 --> 00:21:10.610 align:middle line:84%
So when they
incarnated, which is

00:21:10.610 --> 00:21:13.690 align:middle line:84%
a huge, huge, huge
change in evolution,

00:21:13.690 --> 00:21:15.534 align:middle line:90%
it's now an intervention--

00:21:15.534 --> 00:21:17.700 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: You're saying
when the avatars incarnated?

00:21:17.700 --> 00:21:18.290 align:middle line:90%
>>BELITSOS: Yeah.

00:21:18.290 --> 00:21:20.430 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So they incarnated
in through human form

00:21:20.430 --> 00:21:22.650 align:middle line:90%
or a hybridized form?

00:21:22.650 --> 00:21:25.220 align:middle line:84%
>>BELITSOS: They created
hybridized bodies.

00:21:25.220 --> 00:21:29.360 align:middle line:84%
What they did is they had
a particular kind of being

00:21:29.360 --> 00:21:33.920 align:middle line:84%
that extracts the DNA from
indigenous inhabitants,

00:21:33.920 --> 00:21:36.410 align:middle line:84%
extracts their DNA
one at a time--

00:21:36.410 --> 00:21:40.280 align:middle line:84%
they had 100 of them,
50 men and 50 women--

00:21:40.280 --> 00:21:45.199 align:middle line:84%
they extract DNA and insert
them into constructed bodies.

00:21:45.199 --> 00:21:46.990 align:middle line:84%
So they construct these
bodies, but they're

00:21:46.990 --> 00:21:49.376 align:middle line:90%
bodies that are human bodies.

00:21:49.376 --> 00:21:50.750 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: But my
understanding is

00:21:50.750 --> 00:21:54.270 align:middle line:84%
they were superior in strength
and size and grace and all

00:21:54.270 --> 00:21:54.770 align:middle line:90%
this.

00:21:54.770 --> 00:21:58.040 align:middle line:84%
They were a more
perfected human form.

00:21:58.040 --> 00:22:00.980 align:middle line:84%
>>BELITSOS: The later
incarnations of Adam and Eve

00:22:00.980 --> 00:22:02.140 align:middle line:90%
are larger.

00:22:02.140 --> 00:22:05.670 align:middle line:84%
They're actually tall, much
taller, eight feet tall.

00:22:05.670 --> 00:22:09.600 align:middle line:84%
These beings look like humans
because they use human DNA

00:22:09.600 --> 00:22:11.530 align:middle line:90%
as the main architecture.

00:22:11.530 --> 00:22:15.920 align:middle line:84%
But there's a form that this
is injected into, so to speak.

00:22:15.920 --> 00:22:17.410 align:middle line:84%
But there's another
element which

00:22:17.410 --> 00:22:20.700 align:middle line:84%
is an encircuitment
in the system

00:22:20.700 --> 00:22:25.890 align:middle line:84%
circuits of the local
system of inhabited planets

00:22:25.890 --> 00:22:27.950 align:middle line:90%
from which these beings come.

00:22:27.950 --> 00:22:29.960 align:middle line:84%
So there's a higher
circuitry, so to speak,

00:22:29.960 --> 00:22:34.380 align:middle line:84%
which is biological
of life that, if you

00:22:34.380 --> 00:22:37.610 align:middle line:84%
have the right
constituents, is immortal.

00:22:37.610 --> 00:22:43.940 align:middle line:84%
And the additional constituent
is a tree-- the tree of life

00:22:43.940 --> 00:22:46.540 align:middle line:84%
is a literal fact,
according to this.

00:22:46.540 --> 00:22:49.120 align:middle line:84%
They came with a
tree that had a fruit

00:22:49.120 --> 00:22:53.607 align:middle line:84%
that if you eat the fruit,
it enables the circuitry

00:22:53.607 --> 00:22:54.440 align:middle line:90%
of this off planet--

00:22:54.440 --> 00:22:55.940 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: The
bio-electrical system.

00:22:55.940 --> 00:22:57.825 align:middle line:84%
>>BELITSOS: The
bio-electrical, off planet,

00:22:57.825 --> 00:23:03.420 align:middle line:84%
but it's metaphysical bio--
biophysical, metaphysical,

00:23:03.420 --> 00:23:06.430 align:middle line:90%
off planet circuitry of life.

00:23:06.430 --> 00:23:09.410 align:middle line:84%
It enables it to
operate, but you

00:23:09.410 --> 00:23:14.660 align:middle line:84%
have to eat these fruit
which sort of feed that.

00:23:14.660 --> 00:23:16.960 align:middle line:90%
So they came with a tree.

00:23:16.960 --> 00:23:19.680 align:middle line:84%
And this tree is put in
the center of the city

00:23:19.680 --> 00:23:21.430 align:middle line:90%
that they build.

00:23:21.430 --> 00:23:23.460 align:middle line:84%
And at the very
heart of the city is

00:23:23.460 --> 00:23:26.090 align:middle line:84%
a temple called the
Temple of the Unseen

00:23:26.090 --> 00:23:28.810 align:middle line:90%
Father, father mother god.

00:23:28.810 --> 00:23:33.400 align:middle line:84%
And this temple
is the first time

00:23:33.400 --> 00:23:34.980 align:middle line:84%
that the inhabitants
of the planet

00:23:34.980 --> 00:23:39.830 align:middle line:84%
have been given an off planet
religion that they teach.

00:23:39.830 --> 00:23:42.580 align:middle line:84%
So suddenly these
beings appear who

00:23:42.580 --> 00:23:45.320 align:middle line:84%
are hybrids of off
planet energies,

00:23:45.320 --> 00:23:47.970 align:middle line:90%
let's say, and human DNA.

00:23:47.970 --> 00:23:51.020 align:middle line:84%
And the indigenous
natives that they

00:23:51.020 --> 00:23:55.320 align:middle line:84%
chose to extract
DNA with we're also

00:23:55.320 --> 00:24:00.590 align:middle line:84%
given the same encircuitment,
and they too eat of the tree

00:24:00.590 --> 00:24:01.880 align:middle line:90%
and they are also immortal.

00:24:01.880 --> 00:24:05.620 align:middle line:84%
So there's actually 200
immortals, 100 human

00:24:05.620 --> 00:24:07.686 align:middle line:90%
and 100 transhuman.

00:24:07.686 --> 00:24:09.810 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: OK, now let me
just ask a quick question,

00:24:09.810 --> 00:24:11.268 align:middle line:84%
because I think
some of the viewers

00:24:11.268 --> 00:24:12.940 align:middle line:84%
may be thinking the
same thing I am.

00:24:12.940 --> 00:24:15.430 align:middle line:84%
When you're talking about a
tree and immortality, of course

00:24:15.430 --> 00:24:16.500 align:middle line:90%
we think Garden of Eden.

00:24:16.500 --> 00:24:19.890 align:middle line:84%
We think of the fall of man, the
eating of apple, and so forth.

00:24:19.890 --> 00:24:24.216 align:middle line:84%
Is there any link between these
at this point in the story?

00:24:24.216 --> 00:24:24.930 align:middle line:90%
>>BELITSOS: Yeah.

00:24:24.930 --> 00:24:26.638 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Because that
fruit did go away.

00:24:26.638 --> 00:24:27.490 align:middle line:90%
So, OK.

00:24:27.490 --> 00:24:29.550 align:middle line:84%
So let's talk about
that so we can start

00:24:29.550 --> 00:24:31.880 align:middle line:90%
blending the themes in a bit.

00:24:31.880 --> 00:24:33.390 align:middle line:84%
>>BELITSOS: So
this is intricate,

00:24:33.390 --> 00:24:35.110 align:middle line:84%
so I'm going to try
to slow a little bit.

00:24:35.110 --> 00:24:35.242 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Take your time.

00:24:35.242 --> 00:24:36.200 align:middle line:90%
We have plenty of time.

00:24:36.200 --> 00:24:37.090 align:middle line:90%
Do it.

00:24:37.090 --> 00:24:41.010 align:middle line:84%
>>BELITSOS: So in the Bible,
you have a garbled fusion

00:24:41.010 --> 00:24:43.980 align:middle line:84%
of the two great interventions,
the first one half

00:24:43.980 --> 00:24:48.670 align:middle line:84%
a million years ago, the
second one 38,000 years ago.

00:24:48.670 --> 00:24:52.530 align:middle line:84%
Both of them used the tree,
the so-called tree of life.

00:24:52.530 --> 00:24:54.710 align:middle line:84%
So the tree of life,
once it was transported

00:24:54.710 --> 00:24:57.810 align:middle line:84%
here from off planet-- it was
pretty interesting to think

00:24:57.810 --> 00:25:02.020 align:middle line:84%
of a shrub being brought in a
flying saucer or something--

00:25:02.020 --> 00:25:06.040 align:middle line:84%
planted, and it
produces fruit forever.

00:25:06.040 --> 00:25:10.730 align:middle line:84%
So after the collapse
of this capital

00:25:10.730 --> 00:25:13.980 align:middle line:84%
city, which I'll
get to, the tree

00:25:13.980 --> 00:25:16.480 align:middle line:90%
was taken to another location.

00:25:16.480 --> 00:25:20.020 align:middle line:84%
And then from that location
where it was preserved

00:25:20.020 --> 00:25:23.310 align:middle line:84%
was then moved to
the island of Cyprus.

00:25:23.310 --> 00:25:25.370 align:middle line:84%
So we started in
the Mesopotamia.

00:25:25.370 --> 00:25:28.100 align:middle line:84%
It's moved off site
because of a war,

00:25:28.100 --> 00:25:32.260 align:middle line:84%
then brought to the island
of Cyprus 38,000 years ago.

00:25:32.260 --> 00:25:35.270 align:middle line:84%
And then new incarnate
beings come, that being

00:25:35.270 --> 00:25:37.810 align:middle line:90%
the second great intervention.

00:25:37.810 --> 00:25:40.040 align:middle line:84%
So that's how we get
this tree thing, I think.

00:25:40.040 --> 00:25:40.726 align:middle line:84%
I hope that answers
your question.

00:25:40.726 --> 00:25:40.982 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Mhm.

00:25:40.982 --> 00:25:41.500 align:middle line:90%
Yes, OK.

00:25:41.500 --> 00:25:42.875 align:middle line:84%
>>BELITSOS: But
the Bible kind of

00:25:42.875 --> 00:25:47.357 align:middle line:84%
has one big clump of stories,
so it's not differentiating.

00:25:47.357 --> 00:25:49.190 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Eating from
the tree of knowledge.

00:25:49.190 --> 00:25:50.630 align:middle line:84%
>>BELITSOS: Then there's
another tree, the knowledge

00:25:50.630 --> 00:25:52.480 align:middle line:84%
of good and evil and
the tree of life,

00:25:52.480 --> 00:25:55.120 align:middle line:84%
but this says it truly
is a tree of life,

00:25:55.120 --> 00:25:57.980 align:middle line:84%
but it's like
extraterrestrial life.

00:25:57.980 --> 00:26:00.480 align:middle line:90%
It confers immortality.

00:26:00.480 --> 00:26:03.840 align:middle line:84%
So you have immortals
living on Earth.

00:26:03.840 --> 00:26:06.050 align:middle line:84%
And its the only
allusion I found anything

00:26:06.050 --> 00:26:08.720 align:middle line:84%
quite like that is
in Daoism, which

00:26:08.720 --> 00:26:11.460 align:middle line:90%
has this legend of immortals.

00:26:11.460 --> 00:26:13.640 align:middle line:84%
But there's others too,
but the Daoist immortals

00:26:13.640 --> 00:26:14.710 align:middle line:90%
are very vivid.

00:26:14.710 --> 00:26:18.830 align:middle line:84%
Who are these immortals that
are at the source of Daoism?

00:26:18.830 --> 00:26:22.900 align:middle line:84%
So you might say this is these
things that go all the way back

00:26:22.900 --> 00:26:26.920 align:middle line:84%
500,000 years ago and
the legend of this

00:26:26.920 --> 00:26:30.590 align:middle line:84%
diffused throughout the
world, but in garbled ways

00:26:30.590 --> 00:26:33.264 align:middle line:90%
and translated in odd ways.

00:26:33.264 --> 00:26:35.180 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And often
through their own shamanic

00:26:35.180 --> 00:26:36.960 align:middle line:90%
understandings of life.

00:26:36.960 --> 00:26:38.680 align:middle line:84%
>>BELITSOS: And each
indigenous group

00:26:38.680 --> 00:26:42.470 align:middle line:84%
had a different shamanic view
and a different religious view.

00:26:42.470 --> 00:26:44.347 align:middle line:84%
But there's a lot
of things in common.

00:26:44.347 --> 00:26:44.930 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:26:44.930 --> 00:26:45.430 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

00:26:45.430 --> 00:26:47.540 align:middle line:84%
There are certain themes
that keep popping up,

00:26:47.540 --> 00:26:51.260 align:middle line:84%
such as great destruction,
such as inundations

00:26:51.260 --> 00:26:53.860 align:middle line:84%
that have cleared
masses of humankind

00:26:53.860 --> 00:26:55.610 align:middle line:90%
to recede again, and such.

00:26:55.610 --> 00:26:58.480 align:middle line:84%
So those are common, it
seems, throughout the planet

00:26:58.480 --> 00:27:00.340 align:middle line:90%
and to most religions.

00:27:00.340 --> 00:27:02.730 align:middle line:84%
>>BELITSOS: And that there
are these benign beings

00:27:02.730 --> 00:27:10.240 align:middle line:84%
who came to Earth to teach us
civilization or teach us skills

00:27:10.240 --> 00:27:12.240 align:middle line:90%
and new teachings of religion.

00:27:12.240 --> 00:27:15.180 align:middle line:90%
And that's universal.

00:27:15.180 --> 00:27:18.210 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So we have
the first Adam and Eve.

00:27:18.210 --> 00:27:20.880 align:middle line:84%
We have the city
that was created.

00:27:20.880 --> 00:27:25.620 align:middle line:84%
And then what happened
to that iteration of us?

00:27:25.620 --> 00:27:28.240 align:middle line:84%
>>BELITSOS: So first,
Adam and Eve is second.

00:27:28.240 --> 00:27:33.040 align:middle line:84%
So first, again, is what we
call the staff of the prince.

00:27:33.040 --> 00:27:36.120 align:middle line:84%
So now I'm going to
introduce who this prince is.

00:27:36.120 --> 00:27:38.850 align:middle line:84%
So prince comes from
the biblical allusion

00:27:38.850 --> 00:27:40.770 align:middle line:90%
to the prince of this world.

00:27:40.770 --> 00:27:43.040 align:middle line:84%
So the Urantia book
borrows things the Bible

00:27:43.040 --> 00:27:44.920 align:middle line:90%
and then updates them.

00:27:44.920 --> 00:27:47.000 align:middle line:84%
So the prince of this
world, according to Jesus,

00:27:47.000 --> 00:27:49.150 align:middle line:90%
was the devil, so to speak.

00:27:49.150 --> 00:27:53.640 align:middle line:84%
So they come with a celestial
host that's invisible.

00:27:53.640 --> 00:27:56.240 align:middle line:84%
So the inhabitants
don't see these beings,

00:27:56.240 --> 00:27:59.600 align:middle line:90%
but they see them.

00:27:59.600 --> 00:28:02.720 align:middle line:84%
So at the head of
this is Caligastia.

00:28:02.720 --> 00:28:05.170 align:middle line:84%
So this is this new
name, Caligastia.

00:28:05.170 --> 00:28:06.629 align:middle line:84%
But Shakespeare
may have borrowed,

00:28:06.629 --> 00:28:08.420 align:middle line:84%
or they may have borrowed
from Shakespeare,

00:28:08.420 --> 00:28:10.740 align:middle line:84%
because he has Caliban,
who's this dark figure

00:28:10.740 --> 00:28:12.040 align:middle line:90%
in "The Tempest."

00:28:12.040 --> 00:28:16.640 align:middle line:84%
So Caligastia is now the
governor general of the planet.

00:28:16.640 --> 00:28:19.720 align:middle line:84%
So when these guys
come, they bring

00:28:19.720 --> 00:28:22.570 align:middle line:90%
the planetary chief executive.

00:28:22.570 --> 00:28:26.030 align:middle line:84%
So the planetary chief
executive is an invisible being

00:28:26.030 --> 00:28:30.980 align:middle line:84%
who's in charge of the celestial
host and also the humans.

00:28:30.980 --> 00:28:32.710 align:middle line:84%
But not being able
to see him, you

00:28:32.710 --> 00:28:38.220 align:middle line:84%
have to take translations
from the avatars.

00:28:38.220 --> 00:28:44.230 align:middle line:84%
So I'm saying that these
100 avatars are his staff.

00:28:44.230 --> 00:28:47.140 align:middle line:84%
So he's benign
and they're benign

00:28:47.140 --> 00:28:48.630 align:middle line:84%
and they're teaching
civilization.

00:28:48.630 --> 00:28:51.010 align:middle line:84%
So in "The Urantia
Book," it says that they

00:28:51.010 --> 00:28:53.800 align:middle line:90%
had 300,000 years of teaching.

00:28:53.800 --> 00:28:55.900 align:middle line:84%
That's a long time,
but the inhabitants

00:28:55.900 --> 00:28:57.510 align:middle line:90%
were really, really primitive.

00:28:57.510 --> 00:29:01.580 align:middle line:84%
So they're slowly teaching them
animal husbandry, for example.

00:29:01.580 --> 00:29:03.880 align:middle line:84%
They had no idea how
to domesticate animals.

00:29:03.880 --> 00:29:05.860 align:middle line:90%
They were hunters.

00:29:05.860 --> 00:29:09.430 align:middle line:84%
So they create tribes that can
do these particular things.

00:29:09.430 --> 00:29:13.670 align:middle line:84%
And they have 10 great
areas of skill teaching.

00:29:13.670 --> 00:29:16.380 align:middle line:90%
They're teaching them language.

00:29:16.380 --> 00:29:19.210 align:middle line:84%
They actually have the
first ever alphabet.

00:29:19.210 --> 00:29:21.010 align:middle line:84%
They're teaching
them governance,

00:29:21.010 --> 00:29:23.360 align:middle line:90%
how to run a tribal council.

00:29:23.360 --> 00:29:25.060 align:middle line:84%
They're teaching them
health practices.

00:29:25.060 --> 00:29:27.140 align:middle line:84%
They're teaching them
sanitation practices--

00:29:27.140 --> 00:29:28.310 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Which
was a big part it.

00:29:28.310 --> 00:29:30.435 align:middle line:84%
>>BELITSOS: --which is
important because sanitation

00:29:30.435 --> 00:29:31.890 align:middle line:90%
was unheard of.

00:29:31.890 --> 00:29:34.950 align:middle line:84%
And the beginning, once
they're ready to teach them

00:29:34.950 --> 00:29:35.800 align:middle line:90%
agriculture.

00:29:35.800 --> 00:29:39.040 align:middle line:10%
And on the site of
this capital city,

00:29:39.040 --> 00:29:42.760 align:middle line:10%
they have the first real
agricultural settlements there.

00:29:42.760 --> 00:29:46.300 align:middle line:10%
So they're training these people
and they're sending them out

00:29:46.300 --> 00:29:49.150 align:middle line:10%
and they're going out throughout
the Mesopotamia and then

00:29:49.150 --> 00:29:51.880 align:middle line:10%
beyond that and taking
these skills, which

00:29:51.880 --> 00:29:54.460 align:middle line:10%
are the skills that
are good for survival,

00:29:54.460 --> 00:29:57.070 align:middle line:10%
to tribes that are
really far distant.

00:29:57.070 --> 00:29:59.200 align:middle line:84%
So this is successful
for a long time

00:29:59.200 --> 00:30:01.830 align:middle line:84%
until the Lucifer
rebellion against begins.

00:30:01.830 --> 00:30:04.260 align:middle line:84%
So this is interesting,
again, and the reason I

00:30:04.260 --> 00:30:06.960 align:middle line:84%
bring up Sitchin
because Sitchin states

00:30:06.960 --> 00:30:10.220 align:middle line:84%
that 200,000 years ago,
there was a rebellion

00:30:10.220 --> 00:30:11.710 align:middle line:90%
within the Anunnaki.

00:30:11.710 --> 00:30:14.030 align:middle line:84%
The humans rebelled
against the Anunnaki.

00:30:14.030 --> 00:30:18.550 align:middle line:84%
So that's a similar time
line because the same timing

00:30:18.550 --> 00:30:21.190 align:middle line:84%
and the Urantia book states
that 200,000 years ago, there

00:30:21.190 --> 00:30:22.027 align:middle line:90%
was a rebellion.

00:30:22.027 --> 00:30:23.610 align:middle line:84%
But it's a pretty
different rebellion.

00:30:23.610 --> 00:30:25.020 align:middle line:90%
It's a rebellion of the angels.

00:30:25.020 --> 00:30:25.561 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: OK.

00:30:25.561 --> 00:30:28.480 align:middle line:84%
So now at this time, we have
300,000 years of teaching

00:30:28.480 --> 00:30:30.340 align:middle line:90%
that has been progressing.

00:30:30.340 --> 00:30:33.900 align:middle line:84%
We have the immortals
that are essentially

00:30:33.900 --> 00:30:37.450 align:middle line:84%
seeding information, practices,
and as you say, their knowledge

00:30:37.450 --> 00:30:39.180 align:middle line:90%
and sciences among the people.

00:30:39.180 --> 00:30:42.310 align:middle line:84%
But no crossbreeding
has begun yet?

00:30:42.310 --> 00:30:44.550 align:middle line:84%
>>BELITSOS: This is
not a breeding program.

00:30:44.550 --> 00:30:45.220 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:30:45.220 --> 00:30:46.466 align:middle line:90%
So that's later.

00:30:46.466 --> 00:30:47.840 align:middle line:84%
>>BELITSOS: That's
to come later.

00:30:47.840 --> 00:30:52.850 align:middle line:84%
And in a nutshell, their
two breeding programs,

00:30:52.850 --> 00:30:59.010 align:middle line:84%
you might say, those staff known
as the prince's staff of 100

00:30:59.010 --> 00:31:01.330 align:middle line:84%
are not supposed to
interbreed with humans.

00:31:01.330 --> 00:31:03.240 align:middle line:90%
However, they have genitals.

00:31:03.240 --> 00:31:05.570 align:middle line:90%
They could do that.

00:31:05.570 --> 00:31:09.800 align:middle line:84%
And so when they aborted
their entire regime-- that

00:31:09.800 --> 00:31:14.300 align:middle line:84%
is, it was disrupted by a kind
of revolution and warfare--

00:31:14.300 --> 00:31:18.760 align:middle line:84%
they then diffused
throughout Mesopotamia

00:31:18.760 --> 00:31:20.850 align:middle line:90%
and they began to interbreed.

00:31:20.850 --> 00:31:23.190 align:middle line:84%
That's sort of against
the plan, but they

00:31:23.190 --> 00:31:26.039 align:middle line:84%
do it anyway because they've
degenerated, so to speak.

00:31:26.039 --> 00:31:28.080 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Is this what
was referred to in Genesis

00:31:28.080 --> 00:31:29.230 align:middle line:90%
or is that later?

00:31:29.230 --> 00:31:31.910 align:middle line:84%
>>BELITSOS: That's referred
to in Genesis, we believe,

00:31:31.910 --> 00:31:32.920 align:middle line:90%
as the Nephilim.

00:31:32.920 --> 00:31:36.040 align:middle line:84%
The giant who-- they are
bigger in their stature.

00:31:36.040 --> 00:31:38.460 align:middle line:84%
They're not like Adam and
Eve who are really big.

00:31:38.460 --> 00:31:42.770 align:middle line:84%
But they're big and
they're beautiful.

00:31:42.770 --> 00:31:46.090 align:middle line:84%
So those are the giants
in the Earth in those days

00:31:46.090 --> 00:31:49.480 align:middle line:84%
that precede the story of
Adam and Eve in the Bible,

00:31:49.480 --> 00:31:51.730 align:middle line:84%
and so that correlates
with "The Urantia Book."

00:31:51.730 --> 00:31:53.570 align:middle line:84%
But they already were
present, and they

00:31:53.570 --> 00:31:57.080 align:middle line:84%
created this place called the
land of the Nodites, which is

00:31:57.080 --> 00:31:59.850 align:middle line:90%
in Genesis 6:4, I think it is.

00:31:59.850 --> 00:32:02.350 align:middle line:84%
So this place called
the land of the Nodites.

00:32:02.350 --> 00:32:06.870 align:middle line:84%
And so borrowing
the term Nodites,

00:32:06.870 --> 00:32:09.270 align:middle line:84%
which is named after
one of the staff.

00:32:09.270 --> 00:32:12.550 align:middle line:84%
So the staff people, there were
100 staff people, one of them

00:32:12.550 --> 00:32:14.430 align:middle line:90%
was a guy named Nod.

00:32:14.430 --> 00:32:21.090 align:middle line:84%
So Nod is the leader of the
rebellion on the ground.

00:32:21.090 --> 00:32:24.200 align:middle line:84%
The leader of the rebellion
in the celestial realms

00:32:24.200 --> 00:32:25.390 align:middle line:90%
is Caligastia.

00:32:25.390 --> 00:32:27.920 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So what is Nod--
let's talk about the nature

00:32:27.920 --> 00:32:30.740 align:middle line:90%
of the rebellion led by Nod.

00:32:30.740 --> 00:32:33.460 align:middle line:84%
>>BELITSOS: So it's led
ultimately off planet

00:32:33.460 --> 00:32:36.810 align:middle line:90%
by a high being named Lucifer.

00:32:36.810 --> 00:32:39.030 align:middle line:84%
So Lucifer-- this is hard
to follow, all this stuff,

00:32:39.030 --> 00:32:40.730 align:middle line:90%
so I'll try to go a little slow.

00:32:40.730 --> 00:32:46.070 align:middle line:84%
In "The Urantia Book,"
units of 1,000 inhabited

00:32:46.070 --> 00:32:50.330 align:middle line:84%
planets have an angel that's
the head angel, so to speak.

00:32:50.330 --> 00:32:51.830 align:middle line:90%
It's a super angel.

00:32:51.830 --> 00:32:56.620 align:middle line:84%
So our local group-- and
we're the 606th planet

00:32:56.620 --> 00:32:59.140 align:middle line:84%
in this local
group-- is headed up

00:32:59.140 --> 00:33:03.610 align:middle line:84%
by a brilliant being
who goes astray.

00:33:03.610 --> 00:33:06.060 align:middle line:84%
And it seems implausible,
but that's what we're told.

00:33:06.060 --> 00:33:08.050 align:middle line:84%
And it says one in
a million do this.

00:33:08.050 --> 00:33:09.760 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Well,
and just a little

00:33:09.760 --> 00:33:14.430 align:middle line:84%
backfill from Timothy Wyllie's
work and the being Georgia,

00:33:14.430 --> 00:33:18.270 align:middle line:84%
which is basically very
similar to Urantia work,

00:33:18.270 --> 00:33:22.590 align:middle line:84%
it was stated that the reason
for that particular going

00:33:22.590 --> 00:33:26.790 align:middle line:84%
astray was because the processes
were so slow they thought

00:33:26.790 --> 00:33:30.850 align:middle line:84%
that it might be more
reasonable to speed up

00:33:30.850 --> 00:33:34.110 align:middle line:84%
this evolutionary process,
inject a little bit

00:33:34.110 --> 00:33:36.560 align:middle line:84%
more culture, more of
this, more of that,

00:33:36.560 --> 00:33:39.760 align:middle line:84%
and take it out of the hands of
the slow process of evolution

00:33:39.760 --> 00:33:42.434 align:middle line:84%
and thus, that was
part of the motivation.

00:33:42.434 --> 00:33:44.850 align:middle line:84%
>>BELITSOS: I'm really glad
you mentioned Timothy Wyllie's

00:33:44.850 --> 00:33:45.350 align:middle line:90%
work.

00:33:45.350 --> 00:33:46.600 align:middle line:90%
He's a close friend of mine.

00:33:46.600 --> 00:33:48.950 align:middle line:84%
I published one of his
books, and the new series

00:33:48.950 --> 00:33:50.740 align:middle line:90%
is incredible.

00:33:50.740 --> 00:33:53.200 align:middle line:84%
It's the same story as
in "The Urantia Book,"

00:33:53.200 --> 00:33:54.622 align:middle line:84%
but it adds like
tenfold increase.

00:33:54.622 --> 00:33:55.580 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes, it does.

00:33:55.580 --> 00:33:59.870 align:middle line:84%
>>BELITSOS: So Lucifer
isn't like this awful dark--

00:33:59.870 --> 00:34:02.570 align:middle line:84%
basically, it has this different
theory about how evolution--

00:34:02.570 --> 00:34:02.980 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Let's speed it up.

00:34:02.980 --> 00:34:03.688 align:middle line:90%
Let's work on it.

00:34:03.688 --> 00:34:05.990 align:middle line:84%
>>BELITSOS: This is taking,
like, 100,000 years.

00:34:05.990 --> 00:34:07.410 align:middle line:90%
We could speed this thing up.

00:34:07.410 --> 00:34:09.370 align:middle line:90%
We have innovative ideas.

00:34:09.370 --> 00:34:15.020 align:middle line:84%
We're lower angels, so to speak,
so why don't we try this out?

00:34:15.020 --> 00:34:17.590 align:middle line:84%
But he got pretty
diabolical about it.

00:34:17.590 --> 00:34:20.270 align:middle line:84%
Because he said, look, you
guys are oppressing us, "you"

00:34:20.270 --> 00:34:27.360 align:middle line:84%
being the higher beings all
the way up to God the Father.

00:34:27.360 --> 00:34:29.050 align:middle line:90%
You're oppressing us.

00:34:29.050 --> 00:34:33.040 align:middle line:84%
He didn't go that far as to
say God doesn't even exist

00:34:33.040 --> 00:34:33.830 align:middle line:90%
and that's a myth.

00:34:33.830 --> 00:34:38.800 align:middle line:84%
I mean, that's a pretty drastic
and radical manifesto, as they

00:34:38.800 --> 00:34:40.949 align:middle line:90%
call it, the Lucifer manifesto.

00:34:40.949 --> 00:34:46.040 align:middle line:84%
So he said, well, because
we know now this is a myth,

00:34:46.040 --> 00:34:48.210 align:middle line:90%
we're free to do what we want.

00:34:48.210 --> 00:34:50.969 align:middle line:84%
So we're going to experiment
and all the planets that

00:34:50.969 --> 00:34:54.650 align:middle line:84%
want to follow me, I will
tell you how to do it.

00:34:54.650 --> 00:34:57.930 align:middle line:84%
So I will tell you that you
need to speed things up.

00:34:57.930 --> 00:35:01.520 align:middle line:84%
And as for planet Earth,
what you're doing there,

00:35:01.520 --> 00:35:05.090 align:middle line:84%
it's taking you 300,000
years to get something.

00:35:05.090 --> 00:35:07.180 align:middle line:90%
But we can speed that up.

00:35:07.180 --> 00:35:10.150 align:middle line:84%
So they began to preach
to the inhabitants.

00:35:10.150 --> 00:35:12.710 align:middle line:84%
So once this comes
down from Lucifer

00:35:12.710 --> 00:35:16.010 align:middle line:84%
through Satan who's
lieutenant, to Caligastia,

00:35:16.010 --> 00:35:17.600 align:middle line:84%
then they begin
to say, well, hey.

00:35:17.600 --> 00:35:18.550 align:middle line:90%
These guys are right.

00:35:18.550 --> 00:35:20.660 align:middle line:84%
We've been sitting
here 300,000 years.

00:35:20.660 --> 00:35:23.620 align:middle line:84%
And humans aren't that
stupid, so why don't we

00:35:23.620 --> 00:35:27.430 align:middle line:84%
teach them more advanced
things that they can pick up

00:35:27.430 --> 00:35:29.479 align:middle line:90%
and we'll back them up.

00:35:29.479 --> 00:35:30.020 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: OK.

00:35:30.020 --> 00:35:31.920 align:middle line:84%
Now let's take that
and start looking

00:35:31.920 --> 00:35:36.570 align:middle line:84%
at where the genetic
manipulations begin from there.

00:35:36.570 --> 00:35:38.420 align:middle line:84%
>>BELITSOS: So
from there, there's

00:35:38.420 --> 00:35:42.320 align:middle line:84%
a massive disruption
because once empowered

00:35:42.320 --> 00:35:45.510 align:middle line:84%
in this way, the
inhabitants and natives

00:35:45.510 --> 00:35:49.290 align:middle line:84%
who are all in this, like, 100
miles square site-- Washington,

00:35:49.290 --> 00:35:52.420 align:middle line:84%
DC-- and has settled
for 100 miles,

00:35:52.420 --> 00:35:54.690 align:middle line:84%
and they have these villages
and these tribes are now

00:35:54.690 --> 00:35:56.599 align:middle line:84%
settled and
peaceful, and they're

00:35:56.599 --> 00:35:57.640 align:middle line:90%
coming along pretty well.

00:35:57.640 --> 00:35:59.350 align:middle line:90%
But now they're like, oh, wow.

00:35:59.350 --> 00:36:01.770 align:middle line:84%
It's like the Russian
Revolution or something.

00:36:01.770 --> 00:36:04.170 align:middle line:84%
Let's go out there and
really change things.

00:36:04.170 --> 00:36:07.240 align:middle line:84%
So they begin to
experiment in ways

00:36:07.240 --> 00:36:09.090 align:middle line:90%
that the natives can't handle.

00:36:09.090 --> 00:36:12.080 align:middle line:84%
The natives go out of control,
and they have this license

00:36:12.080 --> 00:36:13.400 align:middle line:90%
to do whatever they want.

00:36:13.400 --> 00:36:14.490 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So what
did that look like?

00:36:14.490 --> 00:36:16.034 align:middle line:84%
What kind of genetic
experimentations

00:36:16.034 --> 00:36:16.950 align:middle line:90%
were done on humanity?

00:36:16.950 --> 00:36:19.620 align:middle line:90%
>>BELITSOS: That occurs later.

00:36:19.620 --> 00:36:24.610 align:middle line:84%
First what happens is they
begin to form factions.

00:36:24.610 --> 00:36:27.762 align:middle line:84%
And the factions go to
war saying, no, this

00:36:27.762 --> 00:36:28.470 align:middle line:90%
is the way to go.

00:36:28.470 --> 00:36:31.160 align:middle line:90%
No, this is the way to go.

00:36:31.160 --> 00:36:35.340 align:middle line:84%
So the staff, the
100 staff, have

00:36:35.340 --> 00:36:37.670 align:middle line:84%
to decide what are
we going to do now?

00:36:37.670 --> 00:36:39.450 align:middle line:90%
We got a problem here.

00:36:39.450 --> 00:36:44.360 align:middle line:84%
So 60 of them join the rebels
saying, we can make this work.

00:36:44.360 --> 00:36:46.470 align:middle line:90%
And 40 of them flee.

00:36:46.470 --> 00:36:49.490 align:middle line:84%
And those are the guys
the stay with the program,

00:36:49.490 --> 00:36:50.720 align:middle line:90%
but they flee, because--

00:36:50.720 --> 00:36:52.428 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Stay with
the original program,

00:36:52.428 --> 00:36:55.580 align:middle line:84%
let it happen naturally,
supposedly within God's domain

00:36:55.580 --> 00:36:56.650 align:middle line:90%
and will.

00:36:56.650 --> 00:36:58.150 align:middle line:84%
>>BELITSOS: Within
the divine will--

00:36:58.150 --> 00:36:58.700 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: The divine blueprint.

00:36:58.700 --> 00:37:00.850 align:middle line:84%
>>BELITSOS: --which is
another way of saying

00:37:00.850 --> 00:37:02.490 align:middle line:90%
this is how evolution works.

00:37:02.490 --> 00:37:03.610 align:middle line:90%
It goes very slowly.

00:37:03.610 --> 00:37:06.240 align:middle line:84%
It took 4 billion
years to get hominids.

00:37:06.240 --> 00:37:09.159 align:middle line:84%
It's a slow thing, but
it works because we

00:37:09.159 --> 00:37:11.075 align:middle line:84%
got millions of planets
where this has worked.

00:37:11.075 --> 00:37:12.283 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Don't mess with it.

00:37:12.283 --> 00:37:13.250 align:middle line:90%
So that's 40 of them.

00:37:13.250 --> 00:37:15.217 align:middle line:84%
The other 60 are saying,
hey, we're with you.

00:37:15.217 --> 00:37:16.300 align:middle line:90%
Let's speed this thing up.

00:37:16.300 --> 00:37:17.570 align:middle line:90%
>>BELITSOS: We're with you.

00:37:17.570 --> 00:37:20.790 align:middle line:84%
Then they've got their leader,
Caligastia is backing them,

00:37:20.790 --> 00:37:23.980 align:middle line:84%
so that's a lot of
prestige behind this idea.

00:37:23.980 --> 00:37:27.400 align:middle line:84%
So he's egging them on, so
right away the whole place

00:37:27.400 --> 00:37:30.510 align:middle line:84%
goes up in flames because
they're having a civil war.

00:37:30.510 --> 00:37:32.420 align:middle line:84%
So they have to basically
abandon the place

00:37:32.420 --> 00:37:34.020 align:middle line:90%
because it burns down.

00:37:34.020 --> 00:37:35.150 align:middle line:90%
So they move north.

00:37:35.150 --> 00:37:38.220 align:middle line:84%
And so this is known as
the Nodite migration.

00:37:38.220 --> 00:37:40.730 align:middle line:84%
The Nodite migration
is a migration

00:37:40.730 --> 00:37:45.670 align:middle line:84%
of these bands of humans who
are following the staff rebel

00:37:45.670 --> 00:37:50.839 align:middle line:84%
leaders into the whole
Mesopotamian area

00:37:50.839 --> 00:37:51.880 align:middle line:90%
and creating settlements.

00:37:51.880 --> 00:37:53.410 align:middle line:84%
So those are the
Nodites settlements

00:37:53.410 --> 00:37:57.720 align:middle line:84%
that are there long
before the biblical era.

00:37:57.720 --> 00:38:01.100 align:middle line:84%
And they are actually
higher cultures

00:38:01.100 --> 00:38:08.170 align:middle line:84%
because they begin to
interbreed with these staff--

00:38:08.170 --> 00:38:10.569 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: The 60 or so
that are remaining there.

00:38:10.569 --> 00:38:11.860 align:middle line:90%
>>BELITSOS: That are remaining.

00:38:11.860 --> 00:38:14.320 align:middle line:84%
So there's a massive
interbreeding program,

00:38:14.320 --> 00:38:16.320 align:middle line:84%
because that's part of
the acceleration program.

00:38:16.320 --> 00:38:17.694 align:middle line:84%
It's like, well,
you can create--

00:38:17.694 --> 00:38:21.510 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So now you have the
Earth DNA and the alien DNA

00:38:21.510 --> 00:38:22.470 align:middle line:90%
really coming together.

00:38:22.470 --> 00:38:24.011 align:middle line:84%
>>BELITSOS: Coming
together, and this

00:38:24.011 --> 00:38:26.770 align:middle line:84%
is what you might call the
first transhuman project.

00:38:26.770 --> 00:38:29.070 align:middle line:90%
So it's a rogue project.

00:38:29.070 --> 00:38:32.440 align:middle line:84%
And it's working in a sense,
because these settlements

00:38:32.440 --> 00:38:33.510 align:middle line:90%
become advanced.

00:38:33.510 --> 00:38:39.330 align:middle line:84%
However, because of the way it
was born, they become warlike.

00:38:39.330 --> 00:38:42.890 align:middle line:84%
And so they become the first
sort of marauding warriors.

00:38:42.890 --> 00:38:44.740 align:middle line:90%
And they take over this region.

00:38:44.740 --> 00:38:49.290 align:middle line:84%
But the good guys flee
way up to the north,

00:38:49.290 --> 00:38:52.544 align:middle line:84%
and they flee into the
area near Afghanistan.

00:38:52.544 --> 00:38:54.210 align:middle line:84%
And that group, there's
not much history

00:38:54.210 --> 00:38:55.610 align:middle line:84%
about that in "The
Urantia Book,"

00:38:55.610 --> 00:38:59.664 align:middle line:84%
and that's filled in by Timothy
Wyllie's new transmissions,

00:38:59.664 --> 00:39:00.830 align:middle line:90%
so it's a whole other story.

00:39:00.830 --> 00:39:04.810 align:middle line:84%
And so those guys got
off with the tree.

00:39:04.810 --> 00:39:09.360 align:middle line:84%
So there was a luck in this,
because they got the tree.

00:39:09.360 --> 00:39:11.069 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: OK, so the
rebels got the tree.

00:39:11.069 --> 00:39:12.859 align:middle line:84%
>>BELITSOS: No, the
good guys got the tree.

00:39:12.859 --> 00:39:14.910 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: OK, I'm staying
with you here now.

00:39:14.910 --> 00:39:17.600 align:middle line:84%
OK, the good guys got the
tree, meaning now the rebels

00:39:17.600 --> 00:39:18.919 align:middle line:90%
are no longer immortal.

00:39:18.919 --> 00:39:20.960 align:middle line:84%
>>BELITSOS: So the rebels
are no longer immortal,

00:39:20.960 --> 00:39:22.876 align:middle line:84%
and that's another reason
to interbreed, so as

00:39:22.876 --> 00:39:26.130 align:middle line:84%
to pass the generics
onto these natives.

00:39:26.130 --> 00:39:28.735 align:middle line:84%
So they pass the genetics on,
and then these guys die off,

00:39:28.735 --> 00:39:30.850 align:middle line:84%
but they live a
really long time.

00:39:30.850 --> 00:39:34.740 align:middle line:84%
And so they're
the heroes of old.

00:39:34.740 --> 00:39:36.539 align:middle line:90%
This is where the legends come.

00:39:36.539 --> 00:39:38.080 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: You mean
the Old Testament?

00:39:38.080 --> 00:39:40.288 align:middle line:84%
>>BELITSOS: Yeah, in the
Old Testament and in Sumeria

00:39:40.288 --> 00:39:42.580 align:middle line:84%
and in all these
other-- so these

00:39:42.580 --> 00:39:44.285 align:middle line:84%
are the giants and
the Earth, they

00:39:44.285 --> 00:39:48.330 align:middle line:84%
are what others call
the ancient astronauts.

00:39:48.330 --> 00:39:53.940 align:middle line:84%
And they do have a
period of flowering,

00:39:53.940 --> 00:39:57.770 align:middle line:84%
but it goes backward
because of warfare.

00:39:57.770 --> 00:40:00.750 align:middle line:84%
Meanwhile in Afghanistan
region are these good guys,

00:40:00.750 --> 00:40:03.080 align:middle line:90%
and they spread out going east.

00:40:03.080 --> 00:40:05.950 align:middle line:84%
Now, this is outside
of "The Urantia Book."

00:40:05.950 --> 00:40:08.740 align:middle line:84%
But this is from
Wyllie's writings, which

00:40:08.740 --> 00:40:12.067 align:middle line:84%
are not accepted by Urantia, but
I think is very, very profound.

00:40:12.067 --> 00:40:12.900 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: I do, too.

00:40:12.900 --> 00:40:17.510 align:middle line:84%
>>BELITSOS: They move east,
and they end up in Lemuria,

00:40:17.510 --> 00:40:19.970 align:middle line:84%
which is also
extra-"Urantia Book," much,

00:40:19.970 --> 00:40:23.580 align:middle line:84%
much later because of the
warfare that is being waged

00:40:23.580 --> 00:40:24.570 align:middle line:90%
in Mesopotamia.

00:40:24.570 --> 00:40:26.100 align:middle line:90%
They have to get out there.

00:40:26.100 --> 00:40:29.480 align:middle line:84%
So this is what spreads
into India, into Asia,

00:40:29.480 --> 00:40:34.930 align:middle line:84%
East Asia, Japan, and then they
leap to islands in the Pacific

00:40:34.930 --> 00:40:39.140 align:middle line:84%
and create a very wonderful
culture called Lemuria.

00:40:39.140 --> 00:40:42.310 align:middle line:84%
So that's a great history
that we can get into.

00:40:42.310 --> 00:40:45.470 align:middle line:84%
But that's sort of the
transhumanist project

00:40:45.470 --> 00:40:48.010 align:middle line:84%
that I believe-- and this
is my own theory-- is

00:40:48.010 --> 00:40:53.430 align:middle line:84%
the source of the Illuminati is
in this area with the Nodites

00:40:53.430 --> 00:40:56.790 align:middle line:84%
interbreeding and then creating
this warlike race which

00:40:56.790 --> 00:41:00.100 align:middle line:84%
was egocentric and
which is believing

00:41:00.100 --> 00:41:07.909 align:middle line:84%
in this idea of liberty
without restraint.

00:41:07.909 --> 00:41:09.450 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And without
responsibility.

00:41:09.450 --> 00:41:11.170 align:middle line:90%
>>BELITSOS: Yeah.

00:41:11.170 --> 00:41:12.970 align:middle line:84%
And they're building
civilization,

00:41:12.970 --> 00:41:18.060 align:middle line:84%
but they don't really have the
right idea of balancing liberty

00:41:18.060 --> 00:41:18.929 align:middle line:90%
and order.

00:41:18.929 --> 00:41:19.470 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: OK.

00:41:19.470 --> 00:41:20.450 align:middle line:90%
So a couple questions.

00:41:20.450 --> 00:41:23.370 align:middle line:84%
So do you believe that that
is the bloodline, that's

00:41:23.370 --> 00:41:27.120 align:middle line:84%
the basis of the bloodlines
that continue to perpetuate down

00:41:27.120 --> 00:41:28.840 align:middle line:90%
into these times?

00:41:28.840 --> 00:41:32.630 align:middle line:84%
>>BELITSOS: That's a
topic of my own research.

00:41:32.630 --> 00:41:36.160 align:middle line:84%
I don't know if people
agree that there

00:41:36.160 --> 00:41:39.080 align:middle line:84%
is such a thing as the
Illuminati of some sort,

00:41:39.080 --> 00:41:40.920 align:middle line:90%
whatever you want to call it.

00:41:40.920 --> 00:41:44.130 align:middle line:84%
There has to be a very
powerful source for this,

00:41:44.130 --> 00:41:47.100 align:middle line:84%
because they become
the royalties of Europe

00:41:47.100 --> 00:41:49.351 align:middle line:90%
and around the world.

00:41:49.351 --> 00:41:51.350 align:middle line:84%
Where do they get this
wealth, and where do they

00:41:51.350 --> 00:41:55.030 align:middle line:84%
get this genetic line
that they claim they have?

00:41:55.030 --> 00:41:59.460 align:middle line:84%
Well, trace it back at
least to Adam and Eve,

00:41:59.460 --> 00:42:02.590 align:middle line:84%
and those literal claims
of this sort of thing.

00:42:02.590 --> 00:42:05.010 align:middle line:90%
But it's much further back.

00:42:05.010 --> 00:42:06.997 align:middle line:84%
So this is getting
into very occult--

00:42:06.997 --> 00:42:08.580 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: It is, and
now we're getting

00:42:08.580 --> 00:42:12.300 align:middle line:84%
into satanic rituals that
are associated with it,

00:42:12.300 --> 00:42:18.520 align:middle line:84%
blue blood, alien
DNA said to have

00:42:18.520 --> 00:42:21.200 align:middle line:84%
contained more
copper base, that's

00:42:21.200 --> 00:42:23.100 align:middle line:90%
the original term, blue blood.

00:42:23.100 --> 00:42:26.800 align:middle line:84%
It gets kind of interesting
and saturated with other lore

00:42:26.800 --> 00:42:28.367 align:middle line:90%
once you get to that point.

00:42:28.367 --> 00:42:29.950 align:middle line:84%
>>BELITSOS: It gets
pretty convoluted,

00:42:29.950 --> 00:42:31.600 align:middle line:84%
and as we were talking
about backstage,

00:42:31.600 --> 00:42:33.960 align:middle line:84%
there's a lot of
inconsistency in this story.

00:42:33.960 --> 00:42:37.319 align:middle line:84%
So this is just one strong story
to try to track with this story

00:42:37.319 --> 00:42:38.735 align:middle line:84%
and then compare
to other stories.

00:42:38.735 --> 00:42:41.330 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: It would be
interesting through the Google

00:42:41.330 --> 00:42:45.740 align:middle line:84%
ladies DNA project to take
a look at their blood.

00:42:45.740 --> 00:42:46.995 align:middle line:90%
Take a look at those genetics.

00:42:46.995 --> 00:42:49.180 align:middle line:84%
>>BELITSOS: Well, there's
something to that.

00:42:49.180 --> 00:42:51.263 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Yeah, I would
like to see that revealed.

00:42:51.263 --> 00:42:51.930 align:middle line:90%
Well, OK now.

00:42:51.930 --> 00:42:54.180 align:middle line:84%
So continue on, because
my next question

00:42:54.180 --> 00:42:56.290 align:middle line:84%
is going to be this--
what happens when

00:42:56.290 --> 00:43:02.120 align:middle line:84%
you take an essentially off
planet culture DNA pattern

00:43:02.120 --> 00:43:06.210 align:middle line:84%
and then you start merging
it via interbreeding

00:43:06.210 --> 00:43:09.830 align:middle line:90%
with an indigenous DNA pattern?

00:43:09.830 --> 00:43:16.657 align:middle line:84%
What happens to the soul
portion that chooses to embody?

00:43:16.657 --> 00:43:17.490 align:middle line:90%
See what I'm saying?

00:43:17.490 --> 00:43:19.000 align:middle line:84%
It starts getting
complicated there.

00:43:19.000 --> 00:43:19.635 align:middle line:84%
>>BELITSOS: It gets
really complicated,

00:43:19.635 --> 00:43:21.340 align:middle line:84%
and it depends on
what you mean by soul.

00:43:21.340 --> 00:43:24.860 align:middle line:84%
But I think of the soul as
that which survives death.

00:43:24.860 --> 00:43:26.007 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:43:26.007 --> 00:43:28.090 align:middle line:84%
But it has to have all
these imprints somehow laid

00:43:28.090 --> 00:43:28.690 align:middle line:90%
down there.

00:43:28.690 --> 00:43:29.398 align:middle line:90%
>>BELITSOS: Yeah.

00:43:29.398 --> 00:43:31.655 align:middle line:84%
It has imprints of-- my
understanding of soul

00:43:31.655 --> 00:43:34.870 align:middle line:84%
is it has do with
things you actually do

00:43:34.870 --> 00:43:38.360 align:middle line:84%
and decisions you make
imprint the souls.

00:43:38.360 --> 00:43:41.510 align:middle line:84%
So if these people are
dark in their choices,

00:43:41.510 --> 00:43:43.570 align:middle line:90%
then their souls are dark.

00:43:43.570 --> 00:43:46.240 align:middle line:84%
So the soul material,
so to speak,

00:43:46.240 --> 00:43:52.670 align:middle line:84%
that's coming into the
afterlife is backward.

00:43:52.670 --> 00:43:55.247 align:middle line:90%
Because these are dark humans.

00:43:55.247 --> 00:43:57.330 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Now we're talking
about the Nodite line.

00:43:57.330 --> 00:43:59.160 align:middle line:90%
>>BELITSOS: The Nodite line.

00:43:59.160 --> 00:44:03.630 align:middle line:84%
However, on Earth they
have power and wealth.

00:44:03.630 --> 00:44:06.370 align:middle line:90%
But their souls are dark.

00:44:06.370 --> 00:44:09.690 align:middle line:84%
So what the objective of the
universe-- which I'd love

00:44:09.690 --> 00:44:12.780 align:middle line:84%
to get into this-- the
evolutionary objective

00:44:12.780 --> 00:44:16.970 align:middle line:84%
of the universe, the
reason for planting life

00:44:16.970 --> 00:44:26.320 align:middle line:84%
is to generate souls that then
contribute to a pool of souls,

00:44:26.320 --> 00:44:29.610 align:middle line:84%
which you might call the
oversoul, which itself is

00:44:29.610 --> 00:44:32.710 align:middle line:90%
evolving until it's perfected.

00:44:32.710 --> 00:44:36.400 align:middle line:84%
So there's a perfection
line of evolution

00:44:36.400 --> 00:44:38.640 align:middle line:84%
that ends with--
it actually comes

00:44:38.640 --> 00:44:41.520 align:middle line:90%
to a high point of perfection.

00:44:41.520 --> 00:44:44.900 align:middle line:84%
So this is really the purpose
of human existence according

00:44:44.900 --> 00:44:46.520 align:middle line:84%
to "The Urantia
Book" and others,

00:44:46.520 --> 00:44:50.780 align:middle line:84%
that we're moving toward
perfection not just on Earth,

00:44:50.780 --> 00:44:53.820 align:middle line:84%
but universal perfection
throughout all the planets,

00:44:53.820 --> 00:44:57.950 align:middle line:84%
and the higher worlds
are perfecting evolution.

00:44:57.950 --> 00:44:59.710 align:middle line:84%
So if you have a
planet where you're

00:44:59.710 --> 00:45:02.660 align:middle line:84%
generating souls
that are dark, they

00:45:02.660 --> 00:45:06.790 align:middle line:84%
don't contribute to evolution of
consciousness in the universe.

00:45:06.790 --> 00:45:07.930 align:middle line:90%
They're backward.

00:45:07.930 --> 00:45:12.310 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And there
is a direct desire

00:45:12.310 --> 00:45:15.270 align:middle line:84%
then as a result of
being in a power position

00:45:15.270 --> 00:45:18.360 align:middle line:84%
and maintaining power to
continue repeating the pattern

00:45:18.360 --> 00:45:22.080 align:middle line:84%
and incarnating it into the same
bloodlines, because they hold,

00:45:22.080 --> 00:45:23.170 align:middle line:90%
basically, the chips.

00:45:23.170 --> 00:45:23.920 align:middle line:90%
>>BELITSOS: Right.

00:45:23.920 --> 00:45:26.780 align:middle line:84%
So there's a belief in
reincarnation of the sort

00:45:26.780 --> 00:45:30.590 align:middle line:84%
that they're coming back
to enjoy their privilege

00:45:30.590 --> 00:45:31.650 align:middle line:90%
and wealth.

00:45:31.650 --> 00:45:33.930 align:middle line:90%
So you could see it that way.

00:45:33.930 --> 00:45:38.490 align:middle line:84%
And that's not contributing
to universal consciousness

00:45:38.490 --> 00:45:43.480 align:middle line:84%
expansion, which has to do
with the souls that are benign

00:45:43.480 --> 00:45:46.560 align:middle line:90%
and loving being generated.

00:45:46.560 --> 00:45:50.330 align:middle line:84%
So the more love you generate
on a planet, the more progress

00:45:50.330 --> 00:45:54.930 align:middle line:84%
there is, not material but
metaphysical or consciousness.

00:45:54.930 --> 00:46:01.160 align:middle line:84%
And so once all beings in the
universe become perfected,

00:46:01.160 --> 00:46:02.655 align:middle line:84%
all beings become
enlightened, say,

00:46:02.655 --> 00:46:06.220 align:middle line:84%
in Mahayana Buddhism with all
beings become enlightened,

00:46:06.220 --> 00:46:09.320 align:middle line:84%
then the Bodhisattva
has done his or her job.

00:46:09.320 --> 00:46:13.070 align:middle line:84%
And so the angelics, or
like the Bodhisattvas who

00:46:13.070 --> 00:46:16.140 align:middle line:84%
were coming here to make
sure we become enlightened

00:46:16.140 --> 00:46:18.390 align:middle line:84%
and we are light enough
for a purpose, which

00:46:18.390 --> 00:46:20.350 align:middle line:90%
is an evolutionary purpose.

00:46:20.350 --> 00:46:26.920 align:middle line:84%
So the darkness says, we're
not interested in your version

00:46:26.920 --> 00:46:27.820 align:middle line:90%
of evolution.

00:46:27.820 --> 00:46:30.640 align:middle line:90%
We're interested in our freedom.

00:46:30.640 --> 00:46:32.300 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: OK, now.

00:46:32.300 --> 00:46:34.480 align:middle line:84%
Are you saying there
is now, I'd like

00:46:34.480 --> 00:46:42.110 align:middle line:84%
to find out, a knock down
effect from this particular new

00:46:42.110 --> 00:46:46.160 align:middle line:84%
scientifically materialistic
transhuman movement.

00:46:46.160 --> 00:46:50.340 align:middle line:90%
Is that from the Nodites?

00:46:50.340 --> 00:46:52.720 align:middle line:90%
Is that from the Illuminati?

00:46:52.720 --> 00:46:56.454 align:middle line:84%
Do you think bloodline,
is it a continuation?

00:46:56.454 --> 00:46:57.870 align:middle line:84%
>>BELITSOS: Yeah,
it seems to me--

00:46:57.870 --> 00:46:59.640 align:middle line:84%
and this is
speculative-- it seems

00:46:59.640 --> 00:47:04.220 align:middle line:84%
to me that this being the
source of power on our planet.

00:47:04.220 --> 00:47:05.910 align:middle line:84%
So they're dominant
and all the way

00:47:05.910 --> 00:47:08.770 align:middle line:84%
coming down to the present
moment to 9/11 and things

00:47:08.770 --> 00:47:09.590 align:middle line:90%
like that.

00:47:09.590 --> 00:47:11.960 align:middle line:90%
So they're manipulating things.

00:47:11.960 --> 00:47:14.550 align:middle line:84%
Right from the beginning,
it was a big manipulation.

00:47:14.550 --> 00:47:16.780 align:middle line:84%
So there's still
this manipulation.

00:47:16.780 --> 00:47:23.390 align:middle line:84%
Rather than letting us evolve
through love and through peace

00:47:23.390 --> 00:47:25.770 align:middle line:90%
building, they're using warfare.

00:47:25.770 --> 00:47:30.055 align:middle line:84%
They're using the Hegelian
dialectic, so to speak,

00:47:30.055 --> 00:47:31.980 align:middle line:90%
of opposition.

00:47:31.980 --> 00:47:33.830 align:middle line:84%
And then throw
technology in there,

00:47:33.830 --> 00:47:37.150 align:middle line:84%
then you really do get
a kind of acceleration.

00:47:37.150 --> 00:47:40.630 align:middle line:84%
You get a kind of acceleration,
but it's not an acceleration

00:47:40.630 --> 00:47:42.210 align:middle line:90%
that builds soulfulness.

00:47:42.210 --> 00:47:42.960 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Exactly.

00:47:42.960 --> 00:47:45.682 align:middle line:90%
>>BELITSOS: It builds power.

00:47:45.682 --> 00:47:47.390 align:middle line:84%
The Russian Revolution's
a great example.

00:47:47.390 --> 00:47:50.250 align:middle line:84%
So you have a
revolution intervene

00:47:50.250 --> 00:47:51.330 align:middle line:90%
in the natural evolution.

00:47:51.330 --> 00:47:53.250 align:middle line:90%
It was not that great in Russia.

00:47:53.250 --> 00:47:55.220 align:middle line:84%
The peasants were
pretty oppressed.

00:47:55.220 --> 00:47:57.610 align:middle line:84%
But they did have a
democratic revolution.

00:47:57.610 --> 00:48:00.430 align:middle line:84%
So Bolshevism comes and it
says, well, this is not enough.

00:48:00.430 --> 00:48:02.280 align:middle line:84%
We can't just have a
democratic revolution.

00:48:02.280 --> 00:48:03.850 align:middle line:90%
We need a communist revolution.

00:48:03.850 --> 00:48:05.980 align:middle line:84%
So they intervene
and accelerate,

00:48:05.980 --> 00:48:09.524 align:middle line:84%
try to accelerate by
introducing technology.

00:48:09.524 --> 00:48:10.940 align:middle line:84%
But in order to
do that, they have

00:48:10.940 --> 00:48:13.860 align:middle line:84%
to destroy the ruling
class of Russia,

00:48:13.860 --> 00:48:16.500 align:middle line:90%
meaning they have to kill them.

00:48:16.500 --> 00:48:20.000 align:middle line:84%
But then they did get
technology imported into Russia.

00:48:20.000 --> 00:48:21.100 align:middle line:90%
That is the paradigm.

00:48:21.100 --> 00:48:24.400 align:middle line:90%
That is the Illuminati paradigm.

00:48:24.400 --> 00:48:26.450 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Well, and
now the big game

00:48:26.450 --> 00:48:29.670 align:middle line:84%
is manipulating life itself,
manipulating intelligence

00:48:29.670 --> 00:48:31.450 align:middle line:84%
itself so it seems
like that would

00:48:31.450 --> 00:48:33.380 align:middle line:84%
be a natural
trajectory from where

00:48:33.380 --> 00:48:37.127 align:middle line:84%
it's been in the past
down through and into now.

00:48:37.127 --> 00:48:38.710 align:middle line:84%
>>BELITSOS: It's
manipulating whatever

00:48:38.710 --> 00:48:40.120 align:middle line:90%
you can get your hands on.

00:48:40.120 --> 00:48:42.735 align:middle line:84%
So if you can get your hands
on the genes, manipulate that.

00:48:42.735 --> 00:48:46.884 align:middle line:84%
If you can get your hands
on plows, manipulate that.

00:48:46.884 --> 00:48:47.550 align:middle line:90%
Whatever it is--

00:48:47.550 --> 00:48:49.300 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So let's
take your point of view

00:48:49.300 --> 00:48:52.600 align:middle line:84%
on, philosophically,
what's to gain now?

00:48:52.600 --> 00:48:55.070 align:middle line:84%
I mean, obviously this
is a loaded question.

00:48:55.070 --> 00:48:59.130 align:middle line:84%
If you're of a
materialistic viewpoint

00:48:59.130 --> 00:49:02.240 align:middle line:84%
and you now have the ability
through money and science

00:49:02.240 --> 00:49:06.240 align:middle line:84%
to begin manipulating DNA,
manipulating intelligence,

00:49:06.240 --> 00:49:08.760 align:middle line:90%
what's that end game?

00:49:08.760 --> 00:49:11.260 align:middle line:84%
>>BELITSOS: It looks pretty
harsh because of the inequality

00:49:11.260 --> 00:49:12.135 align:middle line:90%
we see on the planet.

00:49:12.135 --> 00:49:13.870 align:middle line:84%
So obviously, these
characteristics

00:49:13.870 --> 00:49:16.652 align:middle line:84%
will be given to
powerful, wealthy people.

00:49:16.652 --> 00:49:18.110 align:middle line:84%
The whole thing
will be privatized.

00:49:18.110 --> 00:49:20.690 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And including
life extension,

00:49:20.690 --> 00:49:21.730 align:middle line:90%
which is a part of this.

00:49:21.730 --> 00:49:23.014 align:middle line:90%
It's a big part of the agenda.

00:49:23.014 --> 00:49:24.180 align:middle line:90%
>>BELITSOS: Absolutely also.

00:49:24.180 --> 00:49:25.840 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: But now
you see, the thing

00:49:25.840 --> 00:49:31.010 align:middle line:84%
that's interesting to me is if
you have a viewpoint where life

00:49:31.010 --> 00:49:34.110 align:middle line:84%
is essentially a physical
vehicle the drops

00:49:34.110 --> 00:49:37.510 align:middle line:84%
and that's it, there
is every reason

00:49:37.510 --> 00:49:41.100 align:middle line:84%
to try to do anything
to extend life,

00:49:41.100 --> 00:49:45.350 align:middle line:84%
because there is no belief in
anything that transcends life.

00:49:45.350 --> 00:49:47.420 align:middle line:84%
So then you're
getting into it has

00:49:47.420 --> 00:49:51.800 align:middle line:84%
to be atheistic nature
driving this then, right?

00:49:51.800 --> 00:49:53.270 align:middle line:84%
Because of the
great fear of death

00:49:53.270 --> 00:49:55.010 align:middle line:84%
and losing the mortal
physical vehicle.

00:49:55.010 --> 00:49:55.760 align:middle line:90%
>>BELITSOS: Right.

00:49:55.760 --> 00:49:57.800 align:middle line:84%
Because these guys
are materialists,

00:49:57.800 --> 00:50:00.430 align:middle line:84%
they want immortality,
but they want

00:50:00.430 --> 00:50:03.470 align:middle line:84%
to win it not through
consciousness guidance,

00:50:03.470 --> 00:50:05.240 align:middle line:90%
but through material means.

00:50:05.240 --> 00:50:08.960 align:middle line:84%
So I sympathise, because these
people don't know any better.

00:50:08.960 --> 00:50:11.070 align:middle line:84%
And they do have
access to technologies

00:50:11.070 --> 00:50:12.600 align:middle line:90%
that can maybe do this.

00:50:12.600 --> 00:50:13.150 align:middle line:90%
Maybe so.

00:50:13.150 --> 00:50:13.816 align:middle line:90%
Maybe it's true.

00:50:13.816 --> 00:50:15.542 align:middle line:84%
Maybe we can extend
life 100 years.

00:50:15.542 --> 00:50:17.000 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And maybe
we're naturally

00:50:17.000 --> 00:50:19.730 align:middle line:84%
extending life anyway
because of developments

00:50:19.730 --> 00:50:20.550 align:middle line:90%
that are occurring.

00:50:20.550 --> 00:50:23.340 align:middle line:84%
I mean, this is a
great period of change.

00:50:23.340 --> 00:50:24.990 align:middle line:84%
The frequencies have
changed about us,

00:50:24.990 --> 00:50:27.530 align:middle line:84%
so it might support our
own lengthening of life

00:50:27.530 --> 00:50:28.746 align:middle line:90%
quite naturally anyway.

00:50:28.746 --> 00:50:30.620 align:middle line:84%
>>BELITSOS: Because
naturally, life extension

00:50:30.620 --> 00:50:31.740 align:middle line:90%
has doubled in 100 years.

00:50:31.740 --> 00:50:32.490 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Exactly.

00:50:32.490 --> 00:50:33.990 align:middle line:84%
No reason it shouldn't
happen again.

00:50:33.990 --> 00:50:36.323 align:middle line:84%
>>BELITSOS: You know, we get
technology and better food,

00:50:36.323 --> 00:50:37.180 align:middle line:90%
whatever, nutrition.

00:50:37.180 --> 00:50:39.890 align:middle line:84%
Kurzweil is this guy that's big
on nutrition and everything,

00:50:39.890 --> 00:50:44.390 align:middle line:84%
anything, because he doesn't
believe in an afterlife.

00:50:44.390 --> 00:50:45.480 align:middle line:90%
So this is a big issue.

00:50:45.480 --> 00:50:45.570 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:50:45.570 --> 00:50:46.403 align:middle line:90%
This is a big issue.

00:50:46.403 --> 00:50:51.310 align:middle line:84%
>>BELITSOS: So if you don't have
a cosmology that is spiritual,

00:50:51.310 --> 00:50:52.160 align:middle line:90%
I'm sympathetic.

00:50:52.160 --> 00:50:54.340 align:middle line:84%
If you really believe that
you're going to be snuffed out,

00:50:54.340 --> 00:50:54.840 align:middle line:90%
then yeah.

00:50:54.840 --> 00:50:57.660 align:middle line:84%
You try to find a
tool to make yourself,

00:50:57.660 --> 00:51:01.150 align:middle line:84%
or maybe cryogenics or
something like that.

00:51:01.150 --> 00:51:03.220 align:middle line:84%
Timothy Leary, I
think, you know.

00:51:03.220 --> 00:51:06.480 align:middle line:84%
So you can imagine that
people, so-- this is fine.

00:51:06.480 --> 00:51:08.149 align:middle line:90%
These are technology people.

00:51:08.149 --> 00:51:09.440 align:middle line:90%
They can do what they're doing.

00:51:09.440 --> 00:51:11.670 align:middle line:84%
What we have to do is we
have to give this context

00:51:11.670 --> 00:51:14.920 align:middle line:84%
and we have to bring
theory, evolutionary theory

00:51:14.920 --> 00:51:19.600 align:middle line:84%
and theology and cosmology
that's based on consciousness.

00:51:19.600 --> 00:51:21.730 align:middle line:90%
And I think they're receptive.

00:51:21.730 --> 00:51:23.010 align:middle line:90%
Some are.

00:51:23.010 --> 00:51:25.510 align:middle line:84%
And this book that I
published by Ted Chu

00:51:25.510 --> 00:51:27.580 align:middle line:90%
show that many are receptive.

00:51:27.580 --> 00:51:29.560 align:middle line:84%
So it's at the core
of this are those

00:51:29.560 --> 00:51:31.940 align:middle line:90%
who have a regressive agenda.

00:51:31.940 --> 00:51:33.780 align:middle line:90%
Most of them have no idea.

00:51:33.780 --> 00:51:37.190 align:middle line:84%
It's the way it always is, so
there's a very small group that

00:51:37.190 --> 00:51:38.819 align:middle line:90%
is manipulating everybody else.

00:51:38.819 --> 00:51:39.360 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: OK.

00:51:39.360 --> 00:51:42.160 align:middle line:84%
Now I don't know if this is
a relevant question or not,

00:51:42.160 --> 00:51:45.230 align:middle line:84%
because it kind of
crosses between the two.

00:51:45.230 --> 00:51:48.876 align:middle line:84%
Mormonism and transhumanism--
what's up with that?

00:51:48.876 --> 00:51:50.250 align:middle line:84%
Because here you
have people that

00:51:50.250 --> 00:51:52.710 align:middle line:84%
do believe in an afterlife
and a transcendence,

00:51:52.710 --> 00:51:55.640 align:middle line:84%
and a very cosmic
transcendence at that.

00:51:55.640 --> 00:51:58.242 align:middle line:84%
What is their interest
in transhumanism

00:51:58.242 --> 00:51:59.200 align:middle line:90%
from what you can tell?

00:51:59.200 --> 00:52:00.140 align:middle line:84%
>>BELITSOS: Yeah, I
spoke at a conference--

00:52:00.140 --> 00:52:01.098 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah, I know.

00:52:01.098 --> 00:52:02.460 align:middle line:90%
That's why I'm asking you.

00:52:02.460 --> 00:52:03.320 align:middle line:90%
Like, what's up?

00:52:03.320 --> 00:52:04.945 align:middle line:84%
>>BELITSOS: It was
really an odd thing.

00:52:04.945 --> 00:52:07.450 align:middle line:84%
You know, these are
really great guys.

00:52:07.450 --> 00:52:12.290 align:middle line:84%
Mormonism has sort
of an apocryphal--

00:52:12.290 --> 00:52:15.270 align:middle line:84%
I don't know the
text enough to know,

00:52:15.270 --> 00:52:17.190 align:middle line:84%
because what they
were speaking about

00:52:17.190 --> 00:52:18.680 align:middle line:84%
was over the heads
of the audience,

00:52:18.680 --> 00:52:20.620 align:middle line:84%
because we don't know
their scriptures.

00:52:20.620 --> 00:52:23.670 align:middle line:84%
But they were really fervent,
and they were really smart,

00:52:23.670 --> 00:52:25.980 align:middle line:90%
the Mormon transhumanists.

00:52:25.980 --> 00:52:28.810 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Did you get any kind
of inkling about what the--

00:52:28.810 --> 00:52:30.185 align:middle line:84%
>>BELITSOS:
Basically, they think

00:52:30.185 --> 00:52:32.770 align:middle line:84%
that God placed us here
to advance ourselves

00:52:32.770 --> 00:52:34.390 align:middle line:90%
in any way we can.

00:52:34.390 --> 00:52:38.470 align:middle line:84%
And there will be an afterlife
where we will enhance,

00:52:38.470 --> 00:52:41.270 align:middle line:84%
which will be like a
transhumanist opportunity.

00:52:41.270 --> 00:52:46.750 align:middle line:84%
But while we're here, let's use
what we have within God's plan.

00:52:46.750 --> 00:52:48.660 align:middle line:90%
So I think it's benign.

00:52:48.660 --> 00:52:53.494 align:middle line:84%
And Ted Peters, the theologian,
was impressed in his talk

00:52:53.494 --> 00:52:54.910 align:middle line:84%
with what they
were talking about.

00:52:54.910 --> 00:52:56.868 align:middle line:84%
He said, this is great
because you're embedding

00:52:56.868 --> 00:52:59.080 align:middle line:90%
this in an ethical system.

00:52:59.080 --> 00:53:01.936 align:middle line:84%
And Mormonism has a
very strong sense of--

00:53:01.936 --> 00:53:04.060 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Yeah, it's bridging
the two worlds, yeah.

00:53:04.060 --> 00:53:06.200 align:middle line:84%
>>BELITSOS: So I think
it's a very good thing,

00:53:06.200 --> 00:53:10.490 align:middle line:84%
and it was very helpful
for my thesis to see,

00:53:10.490 --> 00:53:12.610 align:middle line:84%
oh, these guys are
working on this.

00:53:12.610 --> 00:53:15.110 align:middle line:84%
And oh, there was some Buddhists
there speaking about it,

00:53:15.110 --> 00:53:19.470 align:middle line:84%
and there was a Hindu speaker,
and there was a Muslim saying,

00:53:19.470 --> 00:53:22.410 align:middle line:84%
well, our religion talks
about self-transcendence.

00:53:22.410 --> 00:53:27.900 align:middle line:84%
Our religion talks about
super men, you know, so yeah.

00:53:27.900 --> 00:53:30.030 align:middle line:90%
We're for the technology, too.

00:53:30.030 --> 00:53:32.900 align:middle line:84%
So all the religions are
getting in on transhumanism,

00:53:32.900 --> 00:53:35.490 align:middle line:90%
and so that's all for the good.

00:53:35.490 --> 00:53:37.410 align:middle line:84%
So the Urantia
thing got injected

00:53:37.410 --> 00:53:42.040 align:middle line:84%
into that because it has a
picture of transhumans that's

00:53:42.040 --> 00:53:47.240 align:middle line:84%
very vivid and precise,
and of the afterlife that's

00:53:47.240 --> 00:53:48.332 align:middle line:90%
much more rich.

00:53:48.332 --> 00:53:50.290 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: We have only
about five minutes left.

00:53:50.290 --> 00:53:52.404 align:middle line:90%
Can you share that with us?

00:53:52.404 --> 00:53:53.070 align:middle line:90%
>>BELITSOS: Yes.

00:53:53.070 --> 00:53:56.004 align:middle line:84%
So we didn't get too much in,
and I think in our next hour,

00:53:56.004 --> 00:53:57.170 align:middle line:90%
we'll get into Adam and Eve.

00:53:57.170 --> 00:54:00.400 align:middle line:84%
So Adam and Eve are a
transhumanist project.

00:54:00.400 --> 00:54:02.840 align:middle line:84%
They're bringing a
genetic enhancement.

00:54:02.840 --> 00:54:05.160 align:middle line:90%
They're biological uplifters.

00:54:05.160 --> 00:54:06.910 align:middle line:84%
So that is really,
technically, what

00:54:06.910 --> 00:54:11.200 align:middle line:84%
we call transhumanism, where you
get an improved genetics coming

00:54:11.200 --> 00:54:12.760 align:middle line:90%
from somewhere.

00:54:12.760 --> 00:54:15.290 align:middle line:84%
So there's that,
but also the notion

00:54:15.290 --> 00:54:17.080 align:middle line:84%
of the afterlife in
"The Urantia Book"

00:54:17.080 --> 00:54:20.260 align:middle line:84%
is much more detailed
than any others text,

00:54:20.260 --> 00:54:21.880 align:middle line:84%
because I've
searched for 40 years

00:54:21.880 --> 00:54:23.671 align:middle line:84%
and I haven't found
anything close to this.

00:54:23.671 --> 00:54:26.830 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So please share
with us a little taste of it.

00:54:26.830 --> 00:54:33.320 align:middle line:84%
>>BELITSOS: The heavenly realms
are an educational cosmos

00:54:33.320 --> 00:54:38.370 align:middle line:84%
that is there for us to
ascend through various levels

00:54:38.370 --> 00:54:43.230 align:middle line:84%
all the way up to the
central universe, a center

00:54:43.230 --> 00:54:47.710 align:middle line:84%
of the universe which is sort of
a seventh heaven, so to speak,

00:54:47.710 --> 00:54:50.430 align:middle line:90%
where there are perfect beings.

00:54:50.430 --> 00:54:54.850 align:middle line:84%
So we will become
perfected beings-- that

00:54:54.850 --> 00:55:00.260 align:middle line:84%
is, we will be totally
transhuman in the afterlife,

00:55:00.260 --> 00:55:03.980 align:middle line:84%
but we can become transhuman
in the Earth life too.

00:55:03.980 --> 00:55:08.070 align:middle line:84%
We'll become enlightened, but
we will lose, drop, our body.

00:55:08.070 --> 00:55:10.010 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: I was going
to say, is this part

00:55:10.010 --> 00:55:13.080 align:middle line:84%
of the process of ascension
which no longer requires,

00:55:13.080 --> 00:55:14.400 align:middle line:90%
say, reincarnation patterns?

00:55:14.400 --> 00:55:15.150 align:middle line:90%
>>BELITSOS: Right.

00:55:15.150 --> 00:55:16.858 align:middle line:84%
There wouldn't be a
return to the planet.

00:55:16.858 --> 00:55:21.060 align:middle line:84%
You would be getting higher
body and a higher vibration,

00:55:21.060 --> 00:55:22.830 align:middle line:84%
and higher and higher
and higher bodies

00:55:22.830 --> 00:55:25.110 align:middle line:90%
until you get to perfection.

00:55:25.110 --> 00:55:28.230 align:middle line:84%
So the perfected
beings meet and have

00:55:28.230 --> 00:55:33.250 align:middle line:84%
a big party with the perfecting
beings, the already perfect.

00:55:33.250 --> 00:55:37.930 align:middle line:84%
So there's this great dance of
the perfect and the perfecting,

00:55:37.930 --> 00:55:39.990 align:middle line:84%
which is the purpose
of the entire cosmos

00:55:39.990 --> 00:55:41.980 align:middle line:90%
according to the Urantia book.

00:55:41.980 --> 00:55:45.530 align:middle line:84%
So this is sponsored
by the creators.

00:55:45.530 --> 00:55:49.660 align:middle line:84%
It's a kind of play in
which evolutionary humans

00:55:49.660 --> 00:55:53.170 align:middle line:84%
on trillions of planets
are ascending to the center

00:55:53.170 --> 00:55:56.630 align:middle line:84%
and meeting the perfect
beings in the center.

00:55:56.630 --> 00:56:00.000 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Which this is,
again, spread throughout most

00:56:00.000 --> 00:56:03.320 align:middle line:84%
religious doctrines when you
get into the depths of them,

00:56:03.320 --> 00:56:04.250 align:middle line:90%
isn't it?

00:56:04.250 --> 00:56:06.840 align:middle line:84%
That we're working on this
path toward perfection

00:56:06.840 --> 00:56:10.010 align:middle line:84%
where there's no longer a
need for the physical bodies

00:56:10.010 --> 00:56:11.182 align:middle line:90%
that we have now.

00:56:11.182 --> 00:56:13.140 align:middle line:84%
>>BELITSOS: In Pure Land
Buddhism, for example,

00:56:13.140 --> 00:56:15.270 align:middle line:84%
there's this paradise
that you go to where

00:56:15.270 --> 00:56:16.920 align:middle line:90%
there are perfect beings.

00:56:16.920 --> 00:56:17.770 align:middle line:90%
So, yeah.

00:56:17.770 --> 00:56:20.420 align:middle line:84%
Most traditions, the heavens
is where we're going,

00:56:20.420 --> 00:56:22.110 align:middle line:90%
and some we reincarnate.

00:56:22.110 --> 00:56:25.550 align:middle line:84%
But we get off the wheel in
Buddhism and we go somewhere.

00:56:25.550 --> 00:56:28.510 align:middle line:84%
So "The Urantia Book" has,
one of its great contributions

00:56:28.510 --> 00:56:32.480 align:middle line:84%
is that somewhere is
in very fast detail.

00:56:32.480 --> 00:56:33.290 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:56:33.290 --> 00:56:37.350 align:middle line:84%
And meanwhile, the
materialistic viewpoint

00:56:37.350 --> 00:56:39.630 align:middle line:84%
of transhumanism
at this time, do

00:56:39.630 --> 00:56:44.210 align:middle line:84%
you see that as thwarting that
or maybe perhaps just being

00:56:44.210 --> 00:56:46.890 align:middle line:84%
another rung in the
ladder toward that?

00:56:46.890 --> 00:56:49.710 align:middle line:84%
>>BELITSOS: I think they're weak
so-called Illuminati right now,

00:56:49.710 --> 00:56:53.080 align:middle line:84%
so I don't think they'll be able
to thwart this forward motion

00:56:53.080 --> 00:56:54.030 align:middle line:90%
to progress.

00:56:54.030 --> 00:56:55.520 align:middle line:90%
But they're doing their best.

00:56:55.520 --> 00:57:00.340 align:middle line:84%
And so by putting the
transhumanist concept in a box,

00:57:00.340 --> 00:57:01.090 align:middle line:90%
they're thwarting.

00:57:01.090 --> 00:57:03.230 align:middle line:90%
But it gets out.

00:57:03.230 --> 00:57:06.720 align:middle line:84%
And benign researchers
are doing great things,

00:57:06.720 --> 00:57:10.410 align:middle line:84%
extending life,
improving our genetics,

00:57:10.410 --> 00:57:12.722 align:middle line:84%
and extraterrestrials are
getting into the act too.

00:57:12.722 --> 00:57:14.180 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And just
energy medicines

00:57:14.180 --> 00:57:17.670 align:middle line:84%
alone that are now starting to
resurface after maybe hundreds

00:57:17.670 --> 00:57:20.520 align:middle line:84%
of thousands of
years, again, dealing

00:57:20.520 --> 00:57:23.140 align:middle line:84%
with that electrical field,
the bio-electrical field which

00:57:23.140 --> 00:57:26.390 align:middle line:84%
we were talking about earlier
and all the knowledge that's

00:57:26.390 --> 00:57:29.580 align:middle line:84%
coming about energy and
energetic matrix of the body

00:57:29.580 --> 00:57:31.330 align:middle line:84%
should in and of
itself help us live

00:57:31.330 --> 00:57:33.710 align:middle line:84%
longer and healthier
lives, more towards what
