00:00:27.614 --> 00:00:29.280 align:middle line:10%
>>REGINA MEREDITH: A
couple of years ago

00:00:29.280 --> 00:00:32.570 align:middle line:10%
I spoke with Paul O'Brien
about the nature of divination.

00:00:32.570 --> 00:00:35.110 align:middle line:10%
As the founder of Visionary
Networks and Tarot.com,

00:00:35.110 --> 00:00:38.000 align:middle line:10%
Paul has vested his
life in offering

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:41.780 align:middle line:10%
the public accessible means
of using divination tools.

00:00:41.780 --> 00:00:45.160 align:middle line:84%
Today he's with us to talk about
his new book, "Great Decisions,

00:00:45.160 --> 00:00:47.650 align:middle line:84%
Perfect Timing," which
is about cultivating

00:00:47.650 --> 00:00:49.560 align:middle line:90%
our own intuitive intelligence.

00:00:49.560 --> 00:00:51.572 align:middle line:84%
And that's the end
game, isn't it?

00:00:51.572 --> 00:00:53.851 align:middle line:84%
Then they don't
need your software.

00:00:53.851 --> 00:00:54.850 align:middle line:90%
>>PAUL O'BRIEN: Exactly.

00:00:54.850 --> 00:00:56.630 align:middle line:10%
Well that was always
my intention--

00:00:56.630 --> 00:01:00.450 align:middle line:10%
was to empower people to
access their own intuition

00:01:00.450 --> 00:01:03.460 align:middle line:10%
and not be dependent
on external aids.

00:01:03.460 --> 00:01:04.209 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Exactly.

00:01:04.209 --> 00:01:08.090 align:middle line:84%
And you've-- I mean, you
did well by getting people

00:01:08.090 --> 00:01:10.830 align:middle line:84%
in the rhythm and accustomed
to, familiar with,

00:01:10.830 --> 00:01:14.930 align:middle line:84%
and safe with using divination
tools through your websites

00:01:14.930 --> 00:01:16.040 align:middle line:90%
and such.

00:01:16.040 --> 00:01:18.725 align:middle line:84%
And the reality
is it's effective.

00:01:18.725 --> 00:01:20.600 align:middle line:84%
Can I tell the little
story of what happened?

00:01:20.600 --> 00:01:21.690 align:middle line:90%
>>O'BRIEN: Yeah, go ahead.

00:01:21.690 --> 00:01:22.620 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Last
time you were here?

00:01:22.620 --> 00:01:24.590 align:middle line:84%
>>O'BRIEN: Yeah,
that's pretty funny.

00:01:24.590 --> 00:01:25.530 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Well, it was
funny for you and me,

00:01:25.530 --> 00:01:26.880 align:middle line:90%
not for the other person.

00:01:26.880 --> 00:01:30.360 align:middle line:84%
But so, OK, so after the
show-- after we shot the show,

00:01:30.360 --> 00:01:32.320 align:middle line:90%
we went into my office here.

00:01:32.320 --> 00:01:34.560 align:middle line:90%
And we were with another person.

00:01:34.560 --> 00:01:36.917 align:middle line:84%
And the person
decided to download,

00:01:36.917 --> 00:01:39.500 align:middle line:84%
because she was having so much
fun listening to the interview.

00:01:39.500 --> 00:01:42.180 align:middle line:84%
Downloaded the
software and shook

00:01:42.180 --> 00:01:45.710 align:middle line:84%
the iPhone-- her six shakes of
the I Ching-- and looked at it.

00:01:45.710 --> 00:01:47.560 align:middle line:84%
And you peered over
her shoulder and said,

00:01:47.560 --> 00:01:50.170 align:middle line:84%
sounds like you better start
looking for other work.

00:01:50.170 --> 00:01:52.390 align:middle line:84%
And we all giggled,
and the next day she

00:01:52.390 --> 00:01:55.746 align:middle line:84%
was informed that she
no longer had a job.

00:01:55.746 --> 00:01:56.870 align:middle line:90%
>>O'BRIEN: I remember that.

00:01:56.870 --> 00:02:00.970 align:middle line:84%
And I was just
being funny, really.

00:02:00.970 --> 00:02:04.060 align:middle line:84%
The reading that she got
did indicate that there was

00:02:04.060 --> 00:02:06.570 align:middle line:90%
something going to fall apart.

00:02:06.570 --> 00:02:11.181 align:middle line:84%
And we were just demoing my
iPhone app, the Visionary I

00:02:11.181 --> 00:02:11.680 align:middle line:90%
Ching.

00:02:11.680 --> 00:02:15.270 align:middle line:10%
And I didn't put a
lot of import on it

00:02:15.270 --> 00:02:17.460 align:middle line:10%
or consider it to be
extremely meaningful.

00:02:17.460 --> 00:02:19.980 align:middle line:10%
But it was amazing that
it was so right on.

00:02:19.980 --> 00:02:23.600 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Within 24 hours, which
begs the question-- chicken

00:02:23.600 --> 00:02:25.600 align:middle line:90%
or egg?

00:02:25.600 --> 00:02:28.772 align:middle line:84%
This device-- and this
is what's fascinating.

00:02:28.772 --> 00:02:30.980 align:middle line:84%
We're going into a separate
conversation in a minute.

00:02:30.980 --> 00:02:36.070 align:middle line:84%
But it's mind boggling to me
that an animate, organic thing,

00:02:36.070 --> 00:02:39.040 align:middle line:84%
such as ourselves with
our field of consciousness

00:02:39.040 --> 00:02:43.510 align:middle line:84%
can interact with an inanimate
object to this kind of effect,

00:02:43.510 --> 00:02:45.760 align:middle line:84%
where its
[? impression ?] somehow

00:02:45.760 --> 00:02:50.100 align:middle line:84%
reflecting from our own
aura what's about to occur.

00:02:50.100 --> 00:02:52.490 align:middle line:84%
>>O'BRIEN: Well, it's all
about synchronicity-- the way

00:02:52.490 --> 00:02:56.280 align:middle line:84%
the coins land, the way
the cards get shuffled

00:02:56.280 --> 00:02:58.440 align:middle line:84%
and picked is related to
everything else that's

00:02:58.440 --> 00:03:00.590 align:middle line:84%
happening at that
moment in time.

00:03:00.590 --> 00:03:04.130 align:middle line:84%
And presumably the
archetypes that come up

00:03:04.130 --> 00:03:06.510 align:middle line:84%
are related to something
that's happening inside

00:03:06.510 --> 00:03:09.930 align:middle line:84%
of the person who's picking
the cards or casting the coins.

00:03:09.930 --> 00:03:12.860 align:middle line:84%
And in that case, she was
very concerned about a review

00:03:12.860 --> 00:03:14.950 align:middle line:84%
that she was going to
be having the next day.

00:03:14.950 --> 00:03:15.650 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:03:15.650 --> 00:03:16.730 align:middle line:90%
>>O'BRIEN: And this--

00:03:16.730 --> 00:03:18.790 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So the
app picked it up.

00:03:18.790 --> 00:03:19.660 align:middle line:90%
>>O'BRIEN: Right.

00:03:19.660 --> 00:03:20.159 align:middle line:90%
Right.

00:03:20.159 --> 00:03:21.594 align:middle line:90%
But she's the one who cast it.

00:03:21.594 --> 00:03:22.510 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: She cast it.

00:03:22.510 --> 00:03:23.820 align:middle line:90%
>>O'BRIEN: That's what she got.

00:03:23.820 --> 00:03:26.060 align:middle line:84%
And it gave some
advice, but we never

00:03:26.060 --> 00:03:27.360 align:middle line:90%
looked at it that closely.

00:03:27.360 --> 00:03:27.877 align:middle line:90%
But--

00:03:27.877 --> 00:03:29.460 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: We all had
a giggle over it.

00:03:29.460 --> 00:03:32.600 align:middle line:84%
And she goes, oh boy, I'm really
nervous now about the review.

00:03:32.600 --> 00:03:33.830 align:middle line:90%
>>O'BRIEN: Right.

00:03:33.830 --> 00:03:35.750 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: But anyway,
it just fascinates me

00:03:35.750 --> 00:03:38.500 align:middle line:84%
how-- which makes sense,
really, when you're

00:03:38.500 --> 00:03:40.300 align:middle line:84%
talking about
consciousness, and we

00:03:40.300 --> 00:03:42.150 align:middle line:90%
have an electrical component.

00:03:42.150 --> 00:03:44.160 align:middle line:84%
And that electrical
component can reach out

00:03:44.160 --> 00:03:48.270 align:middle line:84%
to other electrical components,
be they carbon or silicon.

00:03:48.270 --> 00:03:49.340 align:middle line:90%
Doesn't really matter.

00:03:49.340 --> 00:03:49.840 align:middle line:90%
Right?

00:03:49.840 --> 00:03:50.300 align:middle line:90%
>>O'BRIEN: Right.

00:03:50.300 --> 00:03:50.800 align:middle line:90%
Right.

00:03:50.800 --> 00:03:53.660 align:middle line:84%
Doesn't matter whether the
technology is a book and coins,

00:03:53.660 --> 00:03:57.150 align:middle line:84%
or the technology
is cardboard cards.

00:03:57.150 --> 00:04:01.640 align:middle line:84%
We can use technology--
we can use it as a tool

00:04:01.640 --> 00:04:03.560 align:middle line:90%
to stimulate our intuition.

00:04:03.560 --> 00:04:07.400 align:middle line:84%
And that was always the approach
that I took to divination.

00:04:07.400 --> 00:04:12.630 align:middle line:84%
And when I built Tarot.com and
IChing.com and AOL Horoscopes,

00:04:12.630 --> 00:04:14.510 align:middle line:84%
I basically always
took that attitude--

00:04:14.510 --> 00:04:18.620 align:middle line:84%
that divination is a way
to stimulate the intuition

00:04:18.620 --> 00:04:21.200 align:middle line:84%
to think outside the
box around problems

00:04:21.200 --> 00:04:23.320 align:middle line:90%
that logic can't handle.

00:04:23.320 --> 00:04:25.960 align:middle line:84%
So it was never about
fortune telling.

00:04:25.960 --> 00:04:29.230 align:middle line:84%
And it wasn't about even
telling you what to do.

00:04:29.230 --> 00:04:32.090 align:middle line:84%
It was sort of like giving you
a sense of which way the wind is

00:04:32.090 --> 00:04:36.650 align:middle line:90%
blowing based on a coincidence.

00:04:36.650 --> 00:04:40.060 align:middle line:84%
But let's say a
meaningful coincidence,

00:04:40.060 --> 00:04:42.730 align:middle line:84%
which is the definition
of synchronicity that

00:04:42.730 --> 00:04:46.000 align:middle line:84%
happened as a result of
this action that you took.

00:04:46.000 --> 00:04:47.990 align:middle line:84%
And the reason I
wrote the new book--

00:04:47.990 --> 00:04:49.960 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Which was
my next question.

00:04:49.960 --> 00:04:50.550 align:middle line:90%
Go for it.

00:04:50.550 --> 00:04:52.270 align:middle line:84%
>>O'BRIEN: Well it's sort of
a natural extension of that.

00:04:52.270 --> 00:04:52.936 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: It is.

00:04:52.936 --> 00:04:56.770 align:middle line:84%
>>O'BRIEN: Because by defining
divination in this way--

00:04:56.770 --> 00:04:59.920 align:middle line:84%
this kind of Jungian way,
where I'm talking about

00:04:59.920 --> 00:05:03.030 align:middle line:84%
archetypes-- each one of the 78
cards in Tarot is an archetype.

00:05:03.030 --> 00:05:06.690 align:middle line:84%
Each one of the 12 signs and
the 10 planets are archetypes.

00:05:06.690 --> 00:05:10.350 align:middle line:84%
Mars means aggressive
or assertive energy.

00:05:10.350 --> 00:05:13.120 align:middle line:84%
Venus means what you're
attracted to, et cetera.

00:05:13.120 --> 00:05:16.240 align:middle line:84%
And in the I Ching,
you've got 64 archetypes.

00:05:16.240 --> 00:05:19.770 align:middle line:84%
So I wanted to write a book
that helped people understand

00:05:19.770 --> 00:05:21.630 align:middle line:90%
that better-- what's going on.

00:05:21.630 --> 00:05:24.090 align:middle line:84%
But this book is not
about divination per se.

00:05:24.090 --> 00:05:28.110 align:middle line:84%
This book is about the
function of divination, which

00:05:28.110 --> 00:05:30.070 align:middle line:90%
is intuitive decision making.

00:05:30.070 --> 00:05:33.120 align:middle line:84%
And I positioned
divination as just one tool

00:05:33.120 --> 00:05:38.350 align:middle line:84%
that can help you access
your intuitive intelligence.

00:05:38.350 --> 00:05:42.050 align:middle line:84%
And the book has got like
six tools for doing this.

00:05:42.050 --> 00:05:44.900 align:middle line:84%
In part two of the
book, only one chapter

00:05:44.900 --> 00:05:46.380 align:middle line:84%
has anything to do
with divination.

00:05:46.380 --> 00:05:48.150 align:middle line:84%
So I'm really getting to
the meat of the matter--

00:05:48.150 --> 00:05:48.730 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes, you are.

00:05:48.730 --> 00:05:51.210 align:middle line:84%
>>O'BRIEN: But the meat of
the matter is decision making.

00:05:51.210 --> 00:05:53.810 align:middle line:84%
It's the most
important thing we do,

00:05:53.810 --> 00:05:57.470 align:middle line:84%
and the big decisions
require a lot of intuition.

00:05:57.470 --> 00:05:58.220 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: They do.

00:05:58.220 --> 00:06:02.160 align:middle line:84%
And yet in our
culture, the process

00:06:02.160 --> 00:06:05.970 align:middle line:84%
of making decisions-- especially
in larger corporations--

00:06:05.970 --> 00:06:08.070 align:middle line:90%
is absolutely brutal.

00:06:08.070 --> 00:06:09.102 align:middle line:90%
It's reductionist.

00:06:09.102 --> 00:06:09.810 align:middle line:90%
>>O'BRIEN: Right.

00:06:09.810 --> 00:06:11.560 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Old paradigm.

00:06:11.560 --> 00:06:13.320 align:middle line:90%
Down to nothing but numbers.

00:06:13.320 --> 00:06:17.350 align:middle line:84%
Not taking the energy of
the individuals in the room

00:06:17.350 --> 00:06:19.900 align:middle line:84%
into consideration,
which is a dire mistake.

00:06:19.900 --> 00:06:22.970 align:middle line:84%
And you see it happen in almost
all corporate-- virtually all

00:06:22.970 --> 00:06:23.632 align:middle line:90%
corporations.

00:06:23.632 --> 00:06:24.340 align:middle line:90%
>>O'BRIEN: Right.

00:06:24.340 --> 00:06:26.530 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Not taking
what an energy

00:06:26.530 --> 00:06:30.660 align:middle line:84%
field brings to the equation or
a wisdom brings to an equation.

00:06:30.660 --> 00:06:32.674 align:middle line:90%
Just numbers.

00:06:32.674 --> 00:06:33.340 align:middle line:90%
>>O'BRIEN: Yeah.

00:06:33.340 --> 00:06:35.850 align:middle line:84%
I mean, in the corporate
environment there's

00:06:35.850 --> 00:06:38.090 align:middle line:90%
a heavy bias towards logic.

00:06:38.090 --> 00:06:41.610 align:middle line:84%
And logic is a very good
tool, but it's not good enough

00:06:41.610 --> 00:06:44.430 align:middle line:84%
if you want to break
a paradigm, if you

00:06:44.430 --> 00:06:47.590 align:middle line:84%
want to invent
something or innovate.

00:06:47.590 --> 00:06:49.570 align:middle line:84%
Like take Steve
Jobs, for instance.

00:06:49.570 --> 00:06:51.760 align:middle line:84%
Part of the reason
he was such a genius

00:06:51.760 --> 00:06:54.200 align:middle line:84%
was he was willing to
think outside the box.

00:06:54.200 --> 00:06:56.830 align:middle line:84%
He famously said, all
the marketing research

00:06:56.830 --> 00:06:58.640 align:middle line:84%
I could buy-- and I
could buy a lot of it--

00:06:58.640 --> 00:07:03.280 align:middle line:84%
is never going to indicate
what a success the iPhone is

00:07:03.280 --> 00:07:03.794 align:middle line:90%
going to be.

00:07:03.794 --> 00:07:04.710 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: That's right

00:07:04.710 --> 00:07:07.900 align:middle line:84%
>>O'BRIEN: And the CEO of
Sony said the same thing

00:07:07.900 --> 00:07:10.040 align:middle line:84%
about the Sony Walkman
back in the day.

00:07:10.040 --> 00:07:13.070 align:middle line:84%
Because people don't
know how they're

00:07:13.070 --> 00:07:16.290 align:middle line:84%
going to react to something
they've never seen before.

00:07:16.290 --> 00:07:20.380 align:middle line:84%
So if you really want to invent
something and break new ground

00:07:20.380 --> 00:07:24.650 align:middle line:84%
and change the paradigm, you
have to rely on intuition.

00:07:24.650 --> 00:07:30.067 align:middle line:84%
And the enemies of intuition
are fear and confusion.

00:07:30.067 --> 00:07:32.150 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: We're going to
get into a lot of factors

00:07:32.150 --> 00:07:33.270 align:middle line:90%
that are the enemy of it.

00:07:33.270 --> 00:07:33.978 align:middle line:90%
>>O'BRIEN: Right.

00:07:33.978 --> 00:07:35.912 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And an over
dependence on logic.

00:07:35.912 --> 00:07:36.620 align:middle line:90%
>>O'BRIEN: Right.

00:07:36.620 --> 00:07:38.286 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Because,
really, you said this

00:07:38.286 --> 00:07:40.300 align:middle line:84%
in a more elegant
way in the book--

00:07:40.300 --> 00:07:42.760 align:middle line:84%
that logic should
theoretically be

00:07:42.760 --> 00:07:45.320 align:middle line:84%
the slave to the higher
mind and the intuition,

00:07:45.320 --> 00:07:46.662 align:middle line:90%
not the other way around.

00:07:46.662 --> 00:07:47.370 align:middle line:90%
>>O'BRIEN: Right.

00:07:47.370 --> 00:07:48.470 align:middle line:90%
That's what Einstein said.

00:07:48.470 --> 00:07:55.870 align:middle line:84%
There's a very famous quote that
logic should lead and-- I mean,

00:07:55.870 --> 00:07:56.990 align:middle line:90%
intuition should lead.

00:07:56.990 --> 00:07:58.487 align:middle line:90%
And logic should be the servant.

00:07:58.487 --> 00:07:59.070 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:07:59.070 --> 00:08:00.653 align:middle line:84%
>>O'BRIEN: And I've
sort of mapped out

00:08:00.653 --> 00:08:03.010 align:middle line:84%
a way of using both
of those things

00:08:03.010 --> 00:08:06.520 align:middle line:84%
in a balanced way for the
sake of those groundbreaking

00:08:06.520 --> 00:08:09.330 align:middle line:84%
or life-changing
decisions that we all

00:08:09.330 --> 00:08:10.499 align:middle line:90%
have to make at some point.

00:08:10.499 --> 00:08:12.040 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Well and
right here, you're

00:08:12.040 --> 00:08:14.170 align:middle line:90%
talking about key moments.

00:08:14.170 --> 00:08:18.750 align:middle line:84%
You were talking about Jeff
Bezos' commencement speech.

00:08:18.750 --> 00:08:20.920 align:middle line:84%
Do you remember that from
the book and what he said?

00:08:20.920 --> 00:08:24.180 align:middle line:84%
Because that was about
as the best advice

00:08:24.180 --> 00:08:26.612 align:middle line:84%
he could have ever given
to a graduating class.

00:08:26.612 --> 00:08:28.320 align:middle line:84%
Talk about that for
a little bit and tell

00:08:28.320 --> 00:08:29.460 align:middle line:90%
why you put it in the book.

00:08:29.460 --> 00:08:30.970 align:middle line:84%
>>O'BRIEN: He's
basically summing up--

00:08:30.970 --> 00:08:32.390 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And who he is
for anyone that may not

00:08:32.390 --> 00:08:32.640 align:middle line:90%
know who he is.

00:08:32.640 --> 00:08:34.431 align:middle line:84%
>>O'BRIEN: Well he's
the founder of Amazon.

00:08:34.431 --> 00:08:36.900 align:middle line:84%
And he gave a commencement
speech at Princeton.

00:08:36.900 --> 00:08:38.470 align:middle line:84%
And he said, when
you look back--

00:08:38.470 --> 00:08:40.270 align:middle line:84%
when you're 80 years
old, and you look back

00:08:40.270 --> 00:08:41.770 align:middle line:84%
on your life, the
things that you're

00:08:41.770 --> 00:08:45.510 align:middle line:84%
going to remember the most and
the most significant things

00:08:45.510 --> 00:08:47.010 align:middle line:84%
that happened in
your life are going

00:08:47.010 --> 00:08:48.920 align:middle line:90%
to be the decisions you made.

00:08:48.920 --> 00:08:51.997 align:middle line:84%
And that life is the
sum of our choices.

00:08:51.997 --> 00:08:52.580 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:08:52.580 --> 00:08:54.413 align:middle line:84%
>>O'BRIEN: And that's
the theme of the book.

00:08:54.413 --> 00:08:57.360 align:middle line:84%
Nothing is more important to
your success and happiness

00:08:57.360 --> 00:08:59.719 align:middle line:84%
than the quality of
the decisions you make.

00:08:59.719 --> 00:09:00.260 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: OK.

00:09:00.260 --> 00:09:01.843 align:middle line:84%
Now that brings me
to something that's

00:09:01.843 --> 00:09:03.820 align:middle line:84%
kind of counter-intuitive
to that.

00:09:03.820 --> 00:09:09.240 align:middle line:84%
So I know people who are junkies
for divination, for example.

00:09:09.240 --> 00:09:10.810 align:middle line:90%
They're junkies for psychics.

00:09:10.810 --> 00:09:12.120 align:middle line:90%
>>O'BRIEN: Right.

00:09:12.120 --> 00:09:14.630 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And what Bezos
and what you are saying

00:09:14.630 --> 00:09:17.950 align:middle line:84%
is, no, it's down
to your decision.

00:09:17.950 --> 00:09:19.800 align:middle line:84%
And you're using
these things lightly

00:09:19.800 --> 00:09:21.810 align:middle line:90%
as a tool to guide intuition.

00:09:21.810 --> 00:09:24.280 align:middle line:84%
But what happens when
we tip to the other side

00:09:24.280 --> 00:09:28.810 align:middle line:84%
and become junkies for every
form of intuition other

00:09:28.810 --> 00:09:30.320 align:middle line:90%
than our own?

00:09:30.320 --> 00:09:33.330 align:middle line:84%
Are you saying that-- maybe--
that everything around us

00:09:33.330 --> 00:09:35.320 align:middle line:90%
reflecting back is part of us?

00:09:35.320 --> 00:09:35.940 align:middle line:90%
I don't know.

00:09:35.940 --> 00:09:38.097 align:middle line:84%
But you see what
I'm saying, which

00:09:38.097 --> 00:09:39.930 align:middle line:84%
almost becomes dependent
on the outside just

00:09:39.930 --> 00:09:41.420 align:middle line:90%
like the other paradigm.

00:09:41.420 --> 00:09:42.160 align:middle line:90%
>>O'BRIEN: Right.

00:09:42.160 --> 00:09:47.420 align:middle line:84%
I think the problem is
we can make bad decisions

00:09:47.420 --> 00:09:49.280 align:middle line:90%
in a number of ways.

00:09:49.280 --> 00:09:52.870 align:middle line:84%
But to break it down into
the two primary ways,

00:09:52.870 --> 00:09:57.420 align:middle line:84%
we can either be overly
analytical-- in which case,

00:09:57.420 --> 00:10:01.320 align:middle line:84%
the common attitude that you'll
see in a corporate environment

00:10:01.320 --> 00:10:03.102 align:middle line:90%
is well I need more information.

00:10:03.102 --> 00:10:05.310 align:middle line:84%
You know, there's always a
need for more information.

00:10:05.310 --> 00:10:07.620 align:middle line:84%
You can never have
too much information.

00:10:07.620 --> 00:10:11.460 align:middle line:84%
And yet that results
in procrastinating

00:10:11.460 --> 00:10:14.340 align:middle line:84%
and often missing a
window of opportunity.

00:10:14.340 --> 00:10:17.460 align:middle line:84%
Because there is no
end to the information

00:10:17.460 --> 00:10:20.600 align:middle line:84%
that might be coming
or what might happen.

00:10:20.600 --> 00:10:22.870 align:middle line:84%
And then the other extreme
is to make decisions

00:10:22.870 --> 00:10:25.510 align:middle line:84%
on an emotional or
impulsive basis.

00:10:25.510 --> 00:10:29.000 align:middle line:84%
And a lot of times, people
will use these tools,

00:10:29.000 --> 00:10:31.740 align:middle line:84%
which are meant to
stimulate the intuition,

00:10:31.740 --> 00:10:34.220 align:middle line:84%
as something that they're
delegating decision

00:10:34.220 --> 00:10:35.510 align:middle line:90%
making power to.

00:10:35.510 --> 00:10:36.970 align:middle line:90%
And I don't agree with that.

00:10:36.970 --> 00:10:39.900 align:middle line:84%
When I ran Tarot.com, we
had six million members.

00:10:39.900 --> 00:10:42.600 align:middle line:84%
And there was a lot of
people who would never

00:10:42.600 --> 00:10:46.160 align:middle line:84%
make any decision without
consulting-- without giving

00:10:46.160 --> 00:10:49.410 align:middle line:84%
themselves a tarot reading or an
I Ching reading on the website.

00:10:49.410 --> 00:10:51.967 align:middle line:84%
And I used to think, God--
I was conflicted about it.

00:10:51.967 --> 00:10:52.550 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:10:52.550 --> 00:10:53.590 align:middle line:90%
That's what I'm asking.

00:10:53.590 --> 00:10:53.810 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:10:53.810 --> 00:10:56.080 align:middle line:84%
>>O'BRIEN: On the one hand, I'm
making money when they do that.

00:10:56.080 --> 00:10:57.600 align:middle line:84%
But on the other
hand, I don't want

00:10:57.600 --> 00:10:59.444 align:middle line:84%
to create that
kind of dependency.

00:10:59.444 --> 00:11:00.110 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:11:00.110 --> 00:11:03.390 align:middle line:84%
>>O'BRIEN: Because they're over
using or misusing the tool.

00:11:03.390 --> 00:11:05.220 align:middle line:84%
They're looking
for someone else--

00:11:05.220 --> 00:11:06.430 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: To make the
decision for them.

00:11:06.430 --> 00:11:07.450 align:middle line:84%
>>O'BRIEN: To tell
them the answers.

00:11:07.450 --> 00:11:07.740 align:middle line:90%
Right.

00:11:07.740 --> 00:11:08.030 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Exactly.

00:11:08.030 --> 00:11:10.029 align:middle line:84%
>>O'BRIEN: And so they're
not getting empowered.

00:11:10.029 --> 00:11:12.550 align:middle line:84%
Their own intuition is
not getting empowered

00:11:12.550 --> 00:11:13.890 align:middle line:90%
when they do that.

00:11:13.890 --> 00:11:18.290 align:middle line:84%
So I look at divination or
going to some kind of intuitive

00:11:18.290 --> 00:11:21.680 align:middle line:84%
reader or something like that--
that can be a helpful thing as

00:11:21.680 --> 00:11:23.929 align:middle line:84%
long as you remember that
they're working for you,

00:11:23.929 --> 00:11:24.970 align:middle line:90%
not the other way around.

00:11:24.970 --> 00:11:25.980 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So it
should be used really

00:11:25.980 --> 00:11:27.460 align:middle line:84%
as validation for
something you're

00:11:27.460 --> 00:11:29.000 align:middle line:90%
already seeding, so to speak.

00:11:29.000 --> 00:11:32.100 align:middle line:84%
>>O'BRIEN: Or a way to
stimulate a new idea.

00:11:32.100 --> 00:11:33.600 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Or maybe
contend with what

00:11:33.600 --> 00:11:36.200 align:middle line:84%
seems to be confusing within
the decision you've made.

00:11:36.200 --> 00:11:39.665 align:middle line:84%
>>O'BRIEN: Well a lot of times
we tend to go black and white.

00:11:39.665 --> 00:11:40.290 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:11:40.290 --> 00:11:42.490 align:middle line:84%
>>O'BRIEN: We're either
going to fight or flee.

00:11:42.490 --> 00:11:42.990 align:middle line:90%
You know?

00:11:42.990 --> 00:11:44.450 align:middle line:90%
And there's a third option.

00:11:44.450 --> 00:11:48.850 align:middle line:84%
And there's always more than two
alternatives to any decision,

00:11:48.850 --> 00:11:50.030 align:middle line:90%
and we tend to forget that.

00:11:50.030 --> 00:11:53.700 align:middle line:84%
We get polarized, and we think
it's either going to be black,

00:11:53.700 --> 00:11:54.870 align:middle line:90%
or it's going to be white.

00:11:54.870 --> 00:11:57.680 align:middle line:84%
And I've either got to do
this or not do it at all.

00:11:57.680 --> 00:11:59.980 align:middle line:84%
And there's a whole
range of gray scale

00:11:59.980 --> 00:12:01.710 align:middle line:90%
that might be more appropriate.

00:12:01.710 --> 00:12:03.820 align:middle line:84%
Lot of times the
best decision to make

00:12:03.820 --> 00:12:05.040 align:middle line:90%
is to do nothing at all.

00:12:05.040 --> 00:12:06.120 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:12:06.120 --> 00:12:09.440 align:middle line:84%
>>O'BRIEN: So we tend to forget
about that, because we're so

00:12:09.440 --> 00:12:10.490 align:middle line:90%
all or nothing.

00:12:10.490 --> 00:12:11.770 align:middle line:90%
And we want--

00:12:11.770 --> 00:12:15.680 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: OK, and that brings
into the next question, which

00:12:15.680 --> 00:12:19.860 align:middle line:84%
is-- because of the speed at
which everything is happening,

00:12:19.860 --> 00:12:22.730 align:middle line:84%
information, decisions having
to be made, data overload

00:12:22.730 --> 00:12:26.750 align:middle line:84%
and so forth, we've become
an extraordinarily impatient

00:12:26.750 --> 00:12:27.430 align:middle line:90%
culture.

00:12:27.430 --> 00:12:27.930 align:middle line:90%
Right?

00:12:27.930 --> 00:12:28.638 align:middle line:90%
>>O'BRIEN: Right.

00:12:28.638 --> 00:12:31.240 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And so we want
instant gratification.

00:12:31.240 --> 00:12:34.380 align:middle line:84%
And so the need to have
to force decisions-- let's

00:12:34.380 --> 00:12:38.040 align:middle line:84%
talk about what impatience
means to the decision making

00:12:38.040 --> 00:12:42.200 align:middle line:84%
process, which is endemic to
the Western world anyway now.

00:12:42.200 --> 00:12:42.980 align:middle line:90%
>>O'BRIEN: Right.

00:12:42.980 --> 00:12:47.400 align:middle line:84%
Well in the visionary
decision making system

00:12:47.400 --> 00:12:53.820 align:middle line:84%
that I outline in the book,
step one is self-knowledge.

00:12:53.820 --> 00:12:56.680 align:middle line:84%
Step one is being
clear about what

00:12:56.680 --> 00:13:00.650 align:middle line:84%
you want, being clear about
what your highest priority is.

00:13:00.650 --> 00:13:02.220 align:middle line:84%
There's two questions
that you have

00:13:02.220 --> 00:13:04.760 align:middle line:84%
to make for a
strategic decision.

00:13:04.760 --> 00:13:06.360 align:middle line:84%
Now I should clarify
here, Regina,

00:13:06.360 --> 00:13:08.860 align:middle line:84%
that we're not talking about
all the decisions we make.

00:13:08.860 --> 00:13:11.275 align:middle line:84%
There's mundane decisions
about which toothpaste to buy

00:13:11.275 --> 00:13:12.410 align:middle line:90%
or which way to turn.

00:13:12.410 --> 00:13:14.100 align:middle line:84%
Then there's tactical
decisions which

00:13:14.100 --> 00:13:17.800 align:middle line:84%
you use to employ a strategy
that you've come to.

00:13:17.800 --> 00:13:20.560 align:middle line:84%
But the strategic decisions--
we've only got about a dozen

00:13:20.560 --> 00:13:21.830 align:middle line:90%
of them in a lifetime.

00:13:21.830 --> 00:13:23.210 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: The big decisions.

00:13:23.210 --> 00:13:23.380 align:middle line:90%
>>O'BRIEN: Yeah.

00:13:23.380 --> 00:13:24.327 align:middle line:90%
Should we get married?

00:13:24.327 --> 00:13:25.160 align:middle line:90%
Should we have kids?

00:13:25.160 --> 00:13:26.160 align:middle line:90%
Should I change jobs?

00:13:26.160 --> 00:13:27.610 align:middle line:90%
Should we move to Boulder?

00:13:27.610 --> 00:13:28.170 align:middle line:90%
Whatever.

00:13:28.170 --> 00:13:31.630 align:middle line:84%
These are big decisions
that can change a life.

00:13:31.630 --> 00:13:34.457 align:middle line:84%
And people need some help
in making these decisions.

00:13:34.457 --> 00:13:35.790 align:middle line:90%
And they need to take some time.

00:13:35.790 --> 00:13:39.790 align:middle line:84%
So you can't be impatient
about that kind of decision.

00:13:39.790 --> 00:13:43.600 align:middle line:84%
That is one of the ways
that intuition gets blocked.

00:13:43.600 --> 00:13:46.870 align:middle line:84%
I like to think of intuition
as a little-- well they

00:13:46.870 --> 00:13:48.990 align:middle line:90%
call it the sixth sense.

00:13:48.990 --> 00:13:52.310 align:middle line:84%
And so if you look at the
hand, and you think-- the palm

00:13:52.310 --> 00:13:54.280 align:middle line:90%
of the hand, that's your mind.

00:13:54.280 --> 00:13:57.530 align:middle line:84%
And these five fingers,
those are the five senses.

00:13:57.530 --> 00:14:00.710 align:middle line:84%
They're like huge antenna, and
they're bringing in sensations.

00:14:00.710 --> 00:14:03.770 align:middle line:84%
They're bringing in impressions
through the visual, auditory,

00:14:03.770 --> 00:14:04.790 align:middle line:90%
et cetera.

00:14:04.790 --> 00:14:08.930 align:middle line:84%
Well, imagine that there's
this tiny little sixth one--

00:14:08.930 --> 00:14:12.700 align:middle line:84%
and it's a small one-- and
that's the sixth sense.

00:14:12.700 --> 00:14:14.150 align:middle line:90%
That's the intuition.

00:14:14.150 --> 00:14:14.930 align:middle line:90%
It's an instinct.

00:14:14.930 --> 00:14:15.950 align:middle line:90%
It's a sense.

00:14:15.950 --> 00:14:19.160 align:middle line:84%
But it's calibrated
to a very fine signal.

00:14:19.160 --> 00:14:21.660 align:middle line:84%
And it's easily drowned
out by the noise

00:14:21.660 --> 00:14:26.030 align:middle line:84%
of all of our preoccupations
with the other five.

00:14:26.030 --> 00:14:31.580 align:middle line:84%
And it's also blocked by
containment domes of fear

00:14:31.580 --> 00:14:34.020 align:middle line:90%
and other strong emotions.

00:14:34.020 --> 00:14:37.480 align:middle line:84%
And people often make a decision
based on the strongest emotion

00:14:37.480 --> 00:14:38.650 align:middle line:90%
that they have.

00:14:38.650 --> 00:14:40.590 align:middle line:84%
And I kind of have a
counter-intuitive rule

00:14:40.590 --> 00:14:45.350 align:middle line:84%
in the book, which is the
stronger the feeling, the less

00:14:45.350 --> 00:14:47.040 align:middle line:90%
trustworthy it is.

00:14:47.040 --> 00:14:47.760 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: OK.

00:14:47.760 --> 00:14:49.930 align:middle line:84%
That's one thing I wanted
to get into in a minute.

00:14:49.930 --> 00:14:51.186 align:middle line:84%
Finish what you're
saying, and then I'm

00:14:51.186 --> 00:14:51.370 align:middle line:90%
going to take you there.

00:14:51.370 --> 00:14:53.578 align:middle line:84%
>>O'BRIEN: You people have
a hard time with that one.

00:14:53.578 --> 00:14:56.040 align:middle line:84%
So the whole thing about
being impatient and being busy

00:14:56.040 --> 00:14:58.757 align:middle line:84%
and attending to all of
the thinking-- of course,

00:14:58.757 --> 00:15:00.340 align:middle line:84%
in addition to the
five senses, you've

00:15:00.340 --> 00:15:02.430 align:middle line:84%
got the clattering, the
internal clattering,

00:15:02.430 --> 00:15:05.240 align:middle line:84%
of the mind, which is
constantly thinking.

00:15:05.240 --> 00:15:09.060 align:middle line:84%
So all of that gets in the
way of the kind of clarity

00:15:09.060 --> 00:15:10.460 align:middle line:90%
that you need to start with.

00:15:10.460 --> 00:15:14.370 align:middle line:84%
You have to be really clear
about-- well what do you want?

00:15:14.370 --> 00:15:16.410 align:middle line:90%
What are the values behind that?

00:15:16.410 --> 00:15:18.440 align:middle line:90%
What's important to you?

00:15:18.440 --> 00:15:20.965 align:middle line:84%
So that you can answer the
two essential questions

00:15:20.965 --> 00:15:23.030 align:middle line:90%
to a strategic decision.

00:15:23.030 --> 00:15:25.750 align:middle line:84%
Question number one
is the what question.

00:15:25.750 --> 00:15:31.387 align:middle line:90%
What is the best next move?

00:15:31.387 --> 00:15:31.970 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:15:31.970 --> 00:15:33.094 align:middle line:90%
>>O'BRIEN: That I can make.

00:15:33.094 --> 00:15:35.210 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And that
is really critical.

00:15:35.210 --> 00:15:37.280 align:middle line:84%
Sometimes we're
jumping forward trying

00:15:37.280 --> 00:15:38.870 align:middle line:90%
to make the big decision.

00:15:38.870 --> 00:15:41.710 align:middle line:84%
And we're missing that there
might be a couple little steps

00:15:41.710 --> 00:15:43.272 align:middle line:90%
that have to occur before that.

00:15:43.272 --> 00:15:43.980 align:middle line:90%
>>O'BRIEN: Right.

00:15:43.980 --> 00:15:48.470 align:middle line:84%
And then the second question is
the timing question, which is--

00:15:48.470 --> 00:15:50.640 align:middle line:90%
and when should I make it?

00:15:50.640 --> 00:15:52.010 align:middle line:90%
When should I pull the trigger?

00:15:52.010 --> 00:15:53.620 align:middle line:90%
When should I execute?

00:15:53.620 --> 00:15:56.060 align:middle line:90%
And that is like 100% intuitive.

00:15:56.060 --> 00:15:57.200 align:middle line:90%
There's no formula.

00:15:57.200 --> 00:15:58.850 align:middle line:84%
There's no logical
formula that's

00:15:58.850 --> 00:16:01.320 align:middle line:84%
going to solve the
timing question.

00:16:01.320 --> 00:16:06.370 align:middle line:84%
So we have to create enough
space to get to the answer

00:16:06.370 --> 00:16:09.000 align:middle line:90%
to question number one first.

00:16:09.000 --> 00:16:12.980 align:middle line:84%
And we can't do that if we're
so darn busy and preoccupied

00:16:12.980 --> 00:16:17.500 align:middle line:84%
with all of the input and all
of the crazy thinking going

00:16:17.500 --> 00:16:18.430 align:middle line:90%
on all the time.

00:16:18.430 --> 00:16:20.480 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And let's go
back to the notion of fear

00:16:20.480 --> 00:16:22.240 align:middle line:90%
that you were talking about.

00:16:22.240 --> 00:16:24.910 align:middle line:90%
Fear is a massive block.

00:16:24.910 --> 00:16:26.390 align:middle line:84%
And a lot of the
people that I know

00:16:26.390 --> 00:16:30.620 align:middle line:84%
that are junkies for
readings and-- I mean,

00:16:30.620 --> 00:16:34.261 align:middle line:84%
they don't make their own
mindset because of fear.

00:16:34.261 --> 00:16:35.760 align:middle line:84%
>>O'BRIEN: A lot
of times people get

00:16:35.760 --> 00:16:39.430 align:middle line:84%
a reading, because they
want their emotional bias

00:16:39.430 --> 00:16:40.850 align:middle line:90%
to be confirmed.

00:16:40.850 --> 00:16:41.520 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:16:41.520 --> 00:16:43.820 align:middle line:84%
>>O'BRIEN: They've already
made up their mind.

00:16:43.820 --> 00:16:45.480 align:middle line:84%
And they know what
they want to do,

00:16:45.480 --> 00:16:47.860 align:middle line:84%
and they have a really
strong feeling about it.

00:16:47.860 --> 00:16:51.200 align:middle line:84%
And so they want some psychic
or some tarot card reading

00:16:51.200 --> 00:16:55.220 align:middle line:84%
to validate that for
them and tell them

00:16:55.220 --> 00:16:56.694 align:middle line:90%
what they want to hear.

00:16:56.694 --> 00:16:58.020 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Mhm.

00:16:58.020 --> 00:17:02.680 align:middle line:84%
>>O'BRIEN: So we
have to get clear

00:17:02.680 --> 00:17:07.244 align:middle line:84%
of the fear obstacle and these
strong emotional reactions.

00:17:07.244 --> 00:17:09.369 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: If you're coming
to the table with fear--

00:17:09.369 --> 00:17:14.140 align:middle line:84%
to any kind of a reader
or to Tarot.com or I Ching

00:17:14.140 --> 00:17:17.160 align:middle line:90%
app, how does that skew things?

00:17:17.160 --> 00:17:22.460 align:middle line:84%
>>O'BRIEN: Well it's going
to affect everything.

00:17:22.460 --> 00:17:23.569 align:middle line:90%
But it's not just fear.

00:17:23.569 --> 00:17:25.260 align:middle line:90%
It's any strong emotion.

00:17:25.260 --> 00:17:26.986 align:middle line:90%
Like, it could be greed.

00:17:26.986 --> 00:17:27.569 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Mhm.

00:17:27.569 --> 00:17:29.610 align:middle line:84%
>>O'BRIEN: They say the
market runs on greed and fear.

00:17:29.610 --> 00:17:29.910 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: That's true.

00:17:29.910 --> 00:17:30.010 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:17:30.010 --> 00:17:31.676 align:middle line:10%
>>O'BRIEN: As long
as you have-- as long

00:17:31.676 --> 00:17:35.910 align:middle line:10%
as you're in the thrall
of a strong emotion,

00:17:35.910 --> 00:17:41.080 align:middle line:10%
you're thinking with the
limbic brain rather than

00:17:41.080 --> 00:17:42.395 align:middle line:10%
the neocortex.

00:17:42.395 --> 00:17:44.270 align:middle line:10%
And you're not going to
make a good decision.

00:17:44.270 --> 00:17:47.800 align:middle line:84%
Now the intuition also
involves the limbic brain,

00:17:47.800 --> 00:17:51.500 align:middle line:84%
because it often appears
in the form of a feeling.

00:17:51.500 --> 00:17:53.200 align:middle line:90%
We like to say a gut feeling.

00:17:53.200 --> 00:17:54.770 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:17:54.770 --> 00:17:56.990 align:middle line:84%
>>O'BRIEN: But it's
a subtle feeling.

00:17:56.990 --> 00:18:00.640 align:middle line:84%
It's a kind of a
still, small voice.

00:18:00.640 --> 00:18:04.260 align:middle line:84%
It's not the overpowering,
commanding feeling

00:18:04.260 --> 00:18:08.480 align:middle line:84%
of fear or greed or lust or
any number of things that's

00:18:08.480 --> 00:18:10.830 align:middle line:90%
going to possibly motivate us.

00:18:10.830 --> 00:18:14.240 align:middle line:84%
So if you're in the thrall
of a strong emotion,

00:18:14.240 --> 00:18:15.870 align:middle line:84%
that's the time to
take a time out.

00:18:15.870 --> 00:18:17.800 align:middle line:84%
That's not a good time
to make a decision.

00:18:17.800 --> 00:18:18.090 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:18:18.090 --> 00:18:19.590 align:middle line:84%
>>O'BRIEN: And I
think we've all had

00:18:19.590 --> 00:18:23.190 align:middle line:84%
the experience of having
a big fight that we really

00:18:23.190 --> 00:18:24.150 align:middle line:90%
didn't need to have.

00:18:24.150 --> 00:18:25.820 align:middle line:84%
And it really didn't
help anything.

00:18:25.820 --> 00:18:28.290 align:middle line:84%
But we were just so caught up
in the emotion of the moment,

00:18:28.290 --> 00:18:31.870 align:middle line:84%
and we couldn't step back
and just kind of simmer down.

00:18:31.870 --> 00:18:34.650 align:middle line:84%
And chapter six in
the book has a lot

00:18:34.650 --> 00:18:36.750 align:middle line:90%
of techniques for doing that.

00:18:36.750 --> 00:18:40.040 align:middle line:84%
So that this intuitive antenna
can get some reception.

00:18:40.040 --> 00:18:41.300 align:middle line:90%
There's too much noise.

00:18:41.300 --> 00:18:43.550 align:middle line:84%
It's sort of like you're
trying to download something,

00:18:43.550 --> 00:18:46.960 align:middle line:84%
and everybody else in your
building is downloading movies,

00:18:46.960 --> 00:18:49.870 align:middle line:90%
and you can't get any reception.

00:18:49.870 --> 00:18:51.940 align:middle line:90%
So it's like that.

00:18:51.940 --> 00:18:53.510 align:middle line:90%
We need to clear the path.

00:18:53.510 --> 00:18:55.899 align:middle line:84%
You can't force
intuition to happen.

00:18:55.899 --> 00:18:56.440 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: No.

00:18:56.440 --> 00:18:59.740 align:middle line:84%
>>O'BRIEN: You can just create
the space for it to happen.

00:18:59.740 --> 00:19:01.060 align:middle line:90%
And that's an art.

00:19:01.060 --> 00:19:03.160 align:middle line:90%
And that's why I wrote the book.

00:19:03.160 --> 00:19:06.715 align:middle line:84%
It's because I want people
to make better decisions.

00:19:06.715 --> 00:19:11.990 align:middle line:84%
You'd think that as a
species with the ability

00:19:11.990 --> 00:19:15.150 align:middle line:84%
to visualize different
possible outcomes to decisions

00:19:15.150 --> 00:19:17.820 align:middle line:84%
we might make or
choices we might take,

00:19:17.820 --> 00:19:20.400 align:middle line:84%
you'd think we would
be really good at this.

00:19:20.400 --> 00:19:21.870 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: You'd think.

00:19:21.870 --> 00:19:26.320 align:middle line:84%
Except we're motivated by
such a kind of fearful choices

00:19:26.320 --> 00:19:28.450 align:middle line:90%
in life, like, oh do I do this?

00:19:28.450 --> 00:19:28.670 align:middle line:84%
>>O'BRIEN: We are
terrible at them.

00:19:28.670 --> 00:19:29.461 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Do I eat?

00:19:29.461 --> 00:19:30.342 align:middle line:90%
We're horrible, yeah.

00:19:30.342 --> 00:19:32.550 align:middle line:84%
>>O'BRIEN: So I'm trying to
figure it out for myself,

00:19:32.550 --> 00:19:35.130 align:middle line:84%
but I'm also trying to figure
it out for my grandson.

00:19:35.130 --> 00:19:37.390 align:middle line:84%
And I'm trying to figure
it out for everybody.

00:19:37.390 --> 00:19:39.040 align:middle line:90%
So that's why I wrote the book.

00:19:39.040 --> 00:19:40.730 align:middle line:84%
Because I don't
think anything is

00:19:40.730 --> 00:19:43.936 align:middle line:84%
more important than the quality
of the decisions we make.

00:19:43.936 --> 00:19:45.060 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: I agree with you.

00:19:45.060 --> 00:19:48.310 align:middle line:84%
Life is nothing but a series of
choices-- from the moment we're

00:19:48.310 --> 00:19:49.630 align:middle line:90%
able to make our own choices.

00:19:49.630 --> 00:19:51.671 align:middle line:84%
>>O'BRIEN: And that's what
Jeff Bezos was saying.

00:19:51.671 --> 00:19:52.450 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:19:52.450 --> 00:19:54.340 align:middle line:90%
I agree 100%.

00:19:54.340 --> 00:19:55.882 align:middle line:90%
It falls on us.

00:19:55.882 --> 00:19:56.590 align:middle line:90%
>>O'BRIEN: Right.

00:19:56.590 --> 00:19:58.839 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: We'd to blame
someone else for what happens,

00:19:58.839 --> 00:20:01.410 align:middle line:84%
but the reality is somewhere
in there-- subconsciously

00:20:01.410 --> 00:20:03.640 align:middle line:84%
or otherwise-- we
have attached to

00:20:03.640 --> 00:20:06.577 align:middle line:84%
or made some kind of decision
that's creating that outcome.

00:20:06.577 --> 00:20:08.660 align:middle line:84%
And as you were talking
about-- a little bit ago--

00:20:08.660 --> 00:20:13.270 align:middle line:84%
about the need to kind of kick
back and wait and not follow

00:20:13.270 --> 00:20:15.980 align:middle line:84%
the strongest urges,
at other times

00:20:15.980 --> 00:20:19.300 align:middle line:84%
there is that-- we might call
it that funny feeling-- that's

00:20:19.300 --> 00:20:22.670 align:middle line:84%
happening that's more subtle
than a direct emotion that

00:20:22.670 --> 00:20:25.510 align:middle line:84%
has a sense of urgency
attached to it.

00:20:25.510 --> 00:20:28.550 align:middle line:84%
I need to go talk
to that person now.

00:20:28.550 --> 00:20:29.750 align:middle line:90%
>>O'BRIEN: Right.

00:20:29.750 --> 00:20:30.250 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:20:30.250 --> 00:20:31.280 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: And that's valid.

00:20:31.280 --> 00:20:31.946 align:middle line:90%
>>O'BRIEN: Yeah.

00:20:31.946 --> 00:20:34.030 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: That's different
than, oh my god, I

00:20:34.030 --> 00:20:35.390 align:middle line:90%
better talk to that person now.

00:20:35.390 --> 00:20:36.960 align:middle line:84%
What if I don't
get another chance?

00:20:36.960 --> 00:20:38.420 align:middle line:90%
Two different things.

00:20:38.420 --> 00:20:42.650 align:middle line:10%
>>O'BRIEN: This gets us to a
better deeper understanding

00:20:42.650 --> 00:20:47.060 align:middle line:10%
of the synchronicity principle,
which Carl Jung discovered back

00:20:47.060 --> 00:20:47.560 align:middle line:10%
in the day.

00:20:47.560 --> 00:20:50.750 align:middle line:10%
And there's a whole section
in the book on what that means

00:20:50.750 --> 00:20:53.580 align:middle line:10%
and how it works.

00:20:53.580 --> 00:20:56.080 align:middle line:84%
But you can sort of boil down
the synchronicity principle

00:20:56.080 --> 00:20:59.760 align:middle line:84%
to the perception that there are
no accidents-- that everything

00:20:59.760 --> 00:21:00.896 align:middle line:90%
happens for a reason.

00:21:00.896 --> 00:21:02.770 align:middle line:84%
Like for instance, I
remember back in the day

00:21:02.770 --> 00:21:05.977 align:middle line:84%
when I was in sales
a long time ago,

00:21:05.977 --> 00:21:07.560 align:middle line:84%
and I was just really
kind of nervous,

00:21:07.560 --> 00:21:10.030 align:middle line:84%
because I had teed
up this prospect.

00:21:10.030 --> 00:21:12.780 align:middle line:84%
And I really wanted to
close this big deal.

00:21:12.780 --> 00:21:14.940 align:middle line:90%
And I was anxious.

00:21:14.940 --> 00:21:16.180 align:middle line:90%
And I was impatient.

00:21:16.180 --> 00:21:20.490 align:middle line:84%
And so I found myself
calling or trying

00:21:20.490 --> 00:21:23.500 align:middle line:84%
to make that call before
I was really ready

00:21:23.500 --> 00:21:26.270 align:middle line:90%
and certainly before I was calm.

00:21:26.270 --> 00:21:30.745 align:middle line:84%
And come to find out I
dialed a wrong number.

00:21:30.745 --> 00:21:31.620 align:middle line:90%
And then I realized--

00:21:31.620 --> 00:21:31.890 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Thank goodness.

00:21:31.890 --> 00:21:33.490 align:middle line:84%
>>O'BRIEN: --oh,
that's the universe.

00:21:33.490 --> 00:21:34.880 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: It's telling
you slow down, kid.

00:21:34.880 --> 00:21:35.890 align:middle line:84%
>>O'BRIEN: Yeah,
it's telling me I'm

00:21:35.890 --> 00:21:37.400 align:middle line:84%
not supposed to make
that call right now.

00:21:37.400 --> 00:21:37.800 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:21:37.800 --> 00:21:38.299 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:21:38.299 --> 00:21:41.630 align:middle line:84%
>>O'BRIEN: So if we learn
to recognize synchronicities

00:21:41.630 --> 00:21:46.230 align:middle line:84%
and interpret them for
what it might mean for us,

00:21:46.230 --> 00:21:49.551 align:middle line:84%
that can be very, very helpful
every day of our lives.

00:21:49.551 --> 00:21:50.300 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: You bet.

00:21:50.300 --> 00:21:51.770 align:middle line:90%
I listen to that stuff.

00:21:51.770 --> 00:21:54.420 align:middle line:84%
If I know I'm about to
do-- if I'm not sure,

00:21:54.420 --> 00:21:58.249 align:middle line:84%
or if, like you say, if I have
too much of a feeling running

00:21:58.249 --> 00:22:00.290 align:middle line:84%
one way or another, and
I attempt to do something

00:22:00.290 --> 00:22:03.180 align:middle line:90%
and I'm blocked-- I get it.

00:22:03.180 --> 00:22:04.410 align:middle line:90%
Back off.

00:22:04.410 --> 00:22:06.210 align:middle line:84%
Let's just back off
and rethink this.

00:22:06.210 --> 00:22:06.980 align:middle line:90%
Give it a rest.

00:22:06.980 --> 00:22:07.860 align:middle line:90%
Wait till tomorrow.

00:22:07.860 --> 00:22:08.360 align:middle line:90%
Whatever.

00:22:08.360 --> 00:22:09.068 align:middle line:90%
>>O'BRIEN: Right.

00:22:09.068 --> 00:22:11.690 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And it usually turns
out to be the exact right thing

00:22:11.690 --> 00:22:12.240 align:middle line:90%
to have done.

00:22:12.240 --> 00:22:12.520 align:middle line:90%
>>O'BRIEN: Right.

00:22:12.520 --> 00:22:13.019 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:22:13.019 --> 00:22:15.020 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And it's
amazing how creative--

00:22:15.020 --> 00:22:18.710 align:middle line:84%
you can call them the universe,
universal intelligence,

00:22:18.710 --> 00:22:21.150 align:middle line:84%
the field, you can call
them your guides or angels--

00:22:21.150 --> 00:22:25.230 align:middle line:84%
are in giving us diverse
ways of creating blockages

00:22:25.230 --> 00:22:28.560 align:middle line:84%
if you're paying attention
when the moment isn't right.

00:22:28.560 --> 00:22:29.460 align:middle line:90%
>>O'BRIEN: Right.

00:22:29.460 --> 00:22:30.030 align:middle line:90%
Exactly.

00:22:30.030 --> 00:22:32.807 align:middle line:84%
Learning how to wait
for the right time--

00:22:32.807 --> 00:22:33.390 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:22:33.390 --> 00:22:35.290 align:middle line:90%
>>O'BRIEN: --is a real skill.

00:22:35.290 --> 00:22:37.860 align:middle line:84%
And if you remember
the book "Siddhartha,"

00:22:37.860 --> 00:22:39.690 align:middle line:84%
which was about the
story of the Buddha.

00:22:39.690 --> 00:22:41.900 align:middle line:84%
There were the three
skills that he had.

00:22:41.900 --> 00:22:43.330 align:middle line:90%
He could meditate.

00:22:43.330 --> 00:22:46.290 align:middle line:90%
He could-- I think it was fast.

00:22:46.290 --> 00:22:47.747 align:middle line:90%
And he could wait.

00:22:47.747 --> 00:22:49.830 align:middle line:84%
So in other words, he had
the skill of letting go,

00:22:49.830 --> 00:22:51.702 align:middle line:84%
but he also had the
skill of patience.

00:22:51.702 --> 00:22:52.660 align:middle line:90%
And this is something--

00:22:52.660 --> 00:22:52.910 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:22:52.910 --> 00:22:54.285 align:middle line:84%
>>O'BRIEN: --that
we can develop.

00:22:54.285 --> 00:22:57.490 align:middle line:84%
When we realize that those
strategic decisions in our life

00:22:57.490 --> 00:23:00.320 align:middle line:84%
are so important, that
they're not worth rushing.

00:23:00.320 --> 00:23:02.570 align:middle line:84%
There's just no percentage
in rushing them.

00:23:02.570 --> 00:23:06.320 align:middle line:84%
And yet we want to make
them in a timely manner.

00:23:06.320 --> 00:23:07.610 align:middle line:90%
So it's kind of a paradox.

00:23:07.610 --> 00:23:08.370 align:middle line:90%
It's an art.

00:23:08.370 --> 00:23:09.350 align:middle line:90%
It's not a science.

00:23:09.350 --> 00:23:11.280 align:middle line:84%
And I don't have an
iron clad formula here.

00:23:11.280 --> 00:23:11.880 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: No.

00:23:11.880 --> 00:23:13.820 align:middle line:84%
>>O'BRIEN: But
there's a lot of--

00:23:13.820 --> 00:23:16.280 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: But we each have
to listen in our own way.

00:23:16.280 --> 00:23:18.720 align:middle line:84%
And we have to have faith
in what it is we're seeing

00:23:18.720 --> 00:23:20.070 align:middle line:90%
or we're experiencing.

00:23:20.070 --> 00:23:22.675 align:middle line:84%
On the subject of rushing,
this just popped into my mind.

00:23:22.675 --> 00:23:24.800 align:middle line:84%
I don't even know if it's
relevant, but it's funny.

00:23:24.800 --> 00:23:29.560 align:middle line:84%
Well it's not funny actually,
but it's interesting.

00:23:29.560 --> 00:23:31.090 align:middle line:90%
I was with my son in Paris.

00:23:31.090 --> 00:23:33.860 align:middle line:84%
We're rushing to try to get the
commuter train back to where we

00:23:33.860 --> 00:23:35.140 align:middle line:90%
were staying in the Left Bank.

00:23:35.140 --> 00:23:38.860 align:middle line:84%
And rushing was
the keyword there.

00:23:38.860 --> 00:23:41.000 align:middle line:90%
So jumped onto a train.

00:23:41.000 --> 00:23:41.950 align:middle line:90%
Looked at the signs.

00:23:41.950 --> 00:23:45.440 align:middle line:84%
Now, I've never been lost in
the subway-- metro-- in Paris.

00:23:45.440 --> 00:23:47.020 align:middle line:90%
Really, I know it pretty well.

00:23:47.020 --> 00:23:48.110 align:middle line:90%
And so I looked.

00:23:48.110 --> 00:23:49.060 align:middle line:90%
OK let's go.

00:23:49.060 --> 00:23:51.780 align:middle line:84%
So I ran across the
platform, got the train.

00:23:51.780 --> 00:23:53.300 align:middle line:90%
I thought, wait a minute.

00:23:53.300 --> 00:23:53.981 align:middle line:90%
The next stop?

00:23:53.981 --> 00:23:54.980 align:middle line:90%
We're at the wrong stop.

00:23:54.980 --> 00:23:56.890 align:middle line:84%
We were going the
opposite direction.

00:23:56.890 --> 00:24:00.650 align:middle line:84%
My eyes saw the correct
sign, because it

00:24:00.650 --> 00:24:01.900 align:middle line:90%
was imprinted in my brain.

00:24:01.900 --> 00:24:05.170 align:middle line:90%
I thought, that's not possible.

00:24:05.170 --> 00:24:06.690 align:middle line:90%
How did this happen?

00:24:06.690 --> 00:24:07.850 align:middle line:90%
So I said, come on.

00:24:07.850 --> 00:24:10.306 align:middle line:84%
We jumped off, went back
across the platform,

00:24:10.306 --> 00:24:12.180 align:middle line:84%
tried to get back where
we were to begin with

00:24:12.180 --> 00:24:14.770 align:middle line:84%
to get on the train going
the other direction.

00:24:14.770 --> 00:24:18.030 align:middle line:84%
And when we got to the
place we needed to be,

00:24:18.030 --> 00:24:21.840 align:middle line:84%
we came running down the
stairs and ran for the train,

00:24:21.840 --> 00:24:22.940 align:middle line:90%
and the door closed.

00:24:22.940 --> 00:24:24.645 align:middle line:90%
Literally a couple steps.

00:24:24.645 --> 00:24:26.270 align:middle line:84%
>>O'BRIEN: I hate it
when that happens.

00:24:26.270 --> 00:24:28.639 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Well this time
it was a good thing.

00:24:28.639 --> 00:24:30.180 align:middle line:84%
Because in the news,
you'll remember.

00:24:30.180 --> 00:24:32.040 align:middle line:84%
That's the train that
was blown up in Paris.

00:24:32.040 --> 00:24:32.860 align:middle line:90%
>>O'BRIEN: Isn't that amazing?

00:24:32.860 --> 00:24:34.359 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And not
only that-- it was

00:24:34.359 --> 00:24:36.100 align:middle line:90%
toward the back of the train.

00:24:36.100 --> 00:24:39.300 align:middle line:84%
And I didn't know
initially what happened.

00:24:39.300 --> 00:24:41.430 align:middle line:84%
We're hot and sweaty,
and we're waiting.

00:24:41.430 --> 00:24:43.120 align:middle line:84%
And what are all
these people doing?

00:24:43.120 --> 00:24:44.030 align:middle line:90%
Where are the trains?

00:24:44.030 --> 00:24:46.810 align:middle line:84%
And someone's speaking in
French over the system.

00:24:46.810 --> 00:24:49.340 align:middle line:90%
And I thought, oh my god.

00:24:49.340 --> 00:24:50.590 align:middle line:90%
What just happened there?

00:24:50.590 --> 00:24:55.700 align:middle line:84%
How did my urgency created the
need for us to miss that train?

00:24:55.700 --> 00:24:57.220 align:middle line:90%
Actually that's what happened.

00:24:57.220 --> 00:24:58.077 align:middle line:90%
>>O'BRIEN: Right.

00:24:58.077 --> 00:24:59.910 align:middle line:84%
When we call-- there's
a chapter in the book

00:24:59.910 --> 00:25:01.510 align:middle line:90%
on belief engineering.

00:25:01.510 --> 00:25:03.170 align:middle line:84%
And there's certain
beliefs that we

00:25:03.170 --> 00:25:04.950 align:middle line:84%
can cultivate that
are going to help us

00:25:04.950 --> 00:25:06.270 align:middle line:90%
in situations like that.

00:25:06.270 --> 00:25:08.340 align:middle line:84%
Like for instance, if we
believe that everything

00:25:08.340 --> 00:25:09.430 align:middle line:90%
happens for a reason--

00:25:09.430 --> 00:25:09.780 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:25:09.780 --> 00:25:11.160 align:middle line:84%
>>O'BRIEN: And we
can remember that--

00:25:11.160 --> 00:25:11.420 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:25:11.420 --> 00:25:13.210 align:middle line:84%
>>O'BRIEN: In a
situation like that,

00:25:13.210 --> 00:25:18.060 align:middle line:84%
then we remember the time when
somebody broke up with us,

00:25:18.060 --> 00:25:19.910 align:middle line:84%
and then we found out
a few months later

00:25:19.910 --> 00:25:21.007 align:middle line:90%
that they were crazy.

00:25:21.007 --> 00:25:21.590 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:25:21.590 --> 00:25:23.464 align:middle line:84%
>>O'BRIEN: Or any number
of things like that.

00:25:23.464 --> 00:25:24.960 align:middle line:84%
So when we get set
back, or we get

00:25:24.960 --> 00:25:28.610 align:middle line:84%
blocked, or there's obstacles in
our way, a lot of times there's

00:25:28.610 --> 00:25:31.155 align:middle line:90%
some fantastic benefit--

00:25:31.155 --> 00:25:32.030 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Absolutely.

00:25:32.030 --> 00:25:32.760 align:middle line:84%
>>O'BRIEN: --that
we don't even know.

00:25:32.760 --> 00:25:35.120 align:middle line:84%
Maybe we need to go
down a different route.

00:25:35.120 --> 00:25:38.030 align:middle line:84%
Maybe we need to go in an
entirely different direction.

00:25:38.030 --> 00:25:41.110 align:middle line:84%
Maybe we would have wasted a
whole lot of time and energy

00:25:41.110 --> 00:25:43.161 align:middle line:90%
and money and God knows--

00:25:43.161 --> 00:25:45.035 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Or maybe we
would have been killed.

00:25:45.035 --> 00:25:45.310 align:middle line:90%
>>O'BRIEN: Exactly.

00:25:45.310 --> 00:25:46.030 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: In the case that day.

00:25:46.030 --> 00:25:47.380 align:middle line:90%
>>O'BRIEN: Yeah, exactly.

00:25:47.380 --> 00:25:50.100 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: I just kept going
over it in my head thinking,

00:25:50.100 --> 00:25:51.340 align:middle line:90%
I saw the sign.

00:25:51.340 --> 00:25:52.720 align:middle line:90%
I know I saw the sign right.

00:25:52.720 --> 00:25:54.230 align:middle line:84%
>>O'BRIEN: It's so hard
to remember that when

00:25:54.230 --> 00:25:55.095 align:middle line:90%
you're frustrated--

00:25:55.095 --> 00:25:55.720 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:25:55.720 --> 00:25:56.870 align:middle line:84%
>>O'BRIEN: --which
is a strong feeling.

00:25:56.870 --> 00:25:58.790 align:middle line:84%
When you're in an
emotional reaction,

00:25:58.790 --> 00:26:01.330 align:middle line:84%
it's really hard to
maintain perspective.

00:26:01.330 --> 00:26:02.910 align:middle line:84%
And that's why I
have a lot of things

00:26:02.910 --> 00:26:05.460 align:middle line:84%
in the book on how to do
that-- how to intervene

00:26:05.460 --> 00:26:09.430 align:middle line:84%
and how to take a time out and
how to use mindfulness in order

00:26:09.430 --> 00:26:11.700 align:middle line:90%
to remember, wait.

00:26:11.700 --> 00:26:12.634 align:middle line:90%
What do I know?

00:26:12.634 --> 00:26:14.550 align:middle line:84%
Maybe there's a good
reason this is happening.

00:26:14.550 --> 00:26:15.140 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Exactly.

00:26:15.140 --> 00:26:15.520 align:middle line:90%
>>O'BRIEN: You know?

00:26:15.520 --> 00:26:16.890 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And I have
total faith in that.

00:26:16.890 --> 00:26:18.620 align:middle line:84%
I do believe
virtually everything--

00:26:18.620 --> 00:26:20.720 align:middle line:84%
there are some odd things
that happen in life.

00:26:20.720 --> 00:26:22.940 align:middle line:84%
But most all of it,
there's a reason for it.

00:26:22.940 --> 00:26:24.244 align:middle line:90%
I don't even resist at all.

00:26:24.244 --> 00:26:25.410 align:middle line:90%
>>O'BRIEN: That's beautiful.

00:26:25.410 --> 00:26:25.630 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:26:25.630 --> 00:26:28.190 align:middle line:84%
It's been a good way to live,
and I've enjoyed my life

00:26:28.190 --> 00:26:30.340 align:middle line:90%
and created what I've wanted.

00:26:30.340 --> 00:26:33.010 align:middle line:84%
For the most part, for a
long time now by doing that.

00:26:33.010 --> 00:26:33.700 align:middle line:90%
>>O'BRIEN: That's what happens.

00:26:33.700 --> 00:26:35.920 align:middle line:84%
That's why the title of the book
is "Great Decisions, Perfect

00:26:35.920 --> 00:26:36.590 align:middle line:90%
Timing."

00:26:36.590 --> 00:26:39.930 align:middle line:84%
When you understand that perfect
timing is happening whether you

00:26:39.930 --> 00:26:43.692 align:middle line:84%
cooperate with it or not,
that's an article of faith

00:26:43.692 --> 00:26:44.775 align:middle line:90%
that really is supportive.

00:26:44.775 --> 00:26:45.442 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:26:45.442 --> 00:26:47.650 align:middle line:84%
>>O'BRIEN: You know, everything
happens for a reason.

00:26:47.650 --> 00:26:49.970 align:middle line:90%
There are no accidents.

00:26:49.970 --> 00:26:51.950 align:middle line:84%
Everything happens
in its own good time

00:26:51.950 --> 00:26:53.810 align:middle line:84%
whether you try to
force it or not.

00:26:53.810 --> 00:26:56.310 align:middle line:84%
Where we get into a problem is
where we try to force things,

00:26:56.310 --> 00:26:58.930 align:middle line:84%
and our ego become so
attached to creating

00:26:58.930 --> 00:27:01.040 align:middle line:84%
some particular
kind of result, it

00:27:01.040 --> 00:27:02.870 align:middle line:84%
might not be the best
thing for us at all.

00:27:02.870 --> 00:27:03.670 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Exactly.

00:27:03.670 --> 00:27:04.580 align:middle line:90%
That attachment.

00:27:04.580 --> 00:27:06.380 align:middle line:84%
Because our mind
thinks it knows what

00:27:06.380 --> 00:27:08.850 align:middle line:84%
it wants when actually
something way more appropriate

00:27:08.850 --> 00:27:10.270 align:middle line:90%
might be waiting there for us.

00:27:10.270 --> 00:27:11.050 align:middle line:90%
>>O'BRIEN: Right.

00:27:11.050 --> 00:27:14.880 align:middle line:84%
And that is a big obstacle to
intuition and good decision

00:27:14.880 --> 00:27:17.090 align:middle line:84%
making-- is
addictions or craving

00:27:17.090 --> 00:27:20.615 align:middle line:84%
or these emotional
attachments to what we think

00:27:20.615 --> 00:27:21.740 align:middle line:90%
is going to be good for us.

00:27:21.740 --> 00:27:22.690 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Exactly.

00:27:22.690 --> 00:27:24.560 align:middle line:84%
OK, so there are
a few areas here.

00:27:24.560 --> 00:27:27.120 align:middle line:84%
You already mentioned before
a little self-knowledge goes

00:27:27.120 --> 00:27:29.050 align:middle line:90%
a long way in making decisions.

00:27:29.050 --> 00:27:30.389 align:middle line:90%
So do the stages of life.

00:27:30.389 --> 00:27:31.930 align:middle line:84%
We make different
kinds of decisions.

00:27:31.930 --> 00:27:32.638 align:middle line:90%
>>O'BRIEN: Right.

00:27:32.638 --> 00:27:35.090 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And you talk about
the three stages of life.

00:27:35.090 --> 00:27:38.060 align:middle line:84%
Go through them and why
you wrote about those.

00:27:38.060 --> 00:27:40.870 align:middle line:84%
>>O'BRIEN: Well I
think that we have

00:27:40.870 --> 00:27:45.250 align:middle line:84%
different kinds of decisions
to make at the different stages

00:27:45.250 --> 00:27:46.140 align:middle line:90%
of life.

00:27:46.140 --> 00:27:48.580 align:middle line:84%
And I divide life
into three stages.

00:27:48.580 --> 00:27:51.710 align:middle line:84%
Now there's a lot of systems
for dividing the transitions

00:27:51.710 --> 00:27:54.070 align:middle line:90%
and passages in life.

00:27:54.070 --> 00:27:59.234 align:middle line:84%
In my view, I do it according
to the Saturn cycle.

00:27:59.234 --> 00:27:59.900 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:27:59.900 --> 00:28:00.925 align:middle line:84%
>>O'BRIEN: So in other
words, you've probably heard

00:28:00.925 --> 00:28:01.240 align:middle line:90%
the expression--

00:28:01.240 --> 00:28:01.540 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Saturn return.

00:28:01.540 --> 00:28:02.581 align:middle line:90%
>>O'BRIEN: Saturn return.

00:28:02.581 --> 00:28:06.440 align:middle line:10%
OK, that happens when
you're 29 or around there.

00:28:06.440 --> 00:28:09.780 align:middle line:10%
And so the first 29
years of your life,

00:28:09.780 --> 00:28:15.210 align:middle line:10%
I call that stage one
or self-discovery.

00:28:15.210 --> 00:28:17.620 align:middle line:84%
And that's when you--
that's the student stage.

00:28:17.620 --> 00:28:20.940 align:middle line:84%
That's when you learn who
you are, what you're good at,

00:28:20.940 --> 00:28:23.950 align:middle line:84%
and what you like to do
or what you love to do.

00:28:23.950 --> 00:28:25.200 align:middle line:90%
And how do you learn that?

00:28:25.200 --> 00:28:27.160 align:middle line:90%
By trying things, by trying--

00:28:27.160 --> 00:28:27.540 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: By making mistakes.

00:28:27.540 --> 00:28:28.430 align:middle line:84%
>>O'BRIEN: --by trying
a lot of things.

00:28:28.430 --> 00:28:29.490 align:middle line:90%
Yes exactly.

00:28:29.490 --> 00:28:31.100 align:middle line:90%
Trial and error.

00:28:31.100 --> 00:28:32.320 align:middle line:90%
I tell these kids.

00:28:32.320 --> 00:28:34.850 align:middle line:90%
I say, you're 19, 20 years old.

00:28:34.850 --> 00:28:36.080 align:middle line:90%
Don't feel so much pressure.

00:28:36.080 --> 00:28:38.330 align:middle line:84%
It's just wrong that
you have to feel

00:28:38.330 --> 00:28:41.150 align:middle line:84%
pressured into choosing a
career that you're going

00:28:41.150 --> 00:28:43.697 align:middle line:90%
to go $50,000 into debt behind.

00:28:43.697 --> 00:28:44.530 align:middle line:90%
And you don't even--

00:28:44.530 --> 00:28:45.360 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: And you're a kid.

00:28:45.360 --> 00:28:47.400 align:middle line:84%
>>O'BRIEN: Your brain isn't
even fully developed yet.

00:28:47.400 --> 00:28:48.120 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:28:48.120 --> 00:28:50.550 align:middle line:84%
>>O'BRIEN: Or don't make
any lifetime commitments

00:28:50.550 --> 00:28:52.000 align:middle line:90%
before you're 29.

00:28:52.000 --> 00:28:54.290 align:middle line:90%
That's basically my advice.

00:28:54.290 --> 00:28:55.710 align:middle line:90%
Job hop.

00:28:55.710 --> 00:28:58.070 align:middle line:84%
Have a lot of-- date
a lot of people.

00:28:58.070 --> 00:29:01.600 align:middle line:84%
Figure out what you're good
at and what you like to do.

00:29:01.600 --> 00:29:05.510 align:middle line:84%
And then there's stage two,
which is the builder stage.

00:29:05.510 --> 00:29:07.470 align:middle line:84%
And that's when you do
the thing you're good at

00:29:07.470 --> 00:29:09.270 align:middle line:90%
or that you love to do.

00:29:09.270 --> 00:29:10.840 align:middle line:84%
And you're as
productive as possible,

00:29:10.840 --> 00:29:14.880 align:middle line:84%
and you learn to provide for
yourself and maybe others,

00:29:14.880 --> 00:29:16.670 align:middle line:90%
maybe family, or whatever.

00:29:16.670 --> 00:29:19.220 align:middle line:84%
And I don't care what
it has to do with-- this

00:29:19.220 --> 00:29:22.850 align:middle line:84%
is a book about success,
but I don't define success

00:29:22.850 --> 00:29:24.609 align:middle line:90%
in any kind of limited terms.

00:29:24.609 --> 00:29:25.900 align:middle line:90%
It's not necessarily financial.

00:29:25.900 --> 00:29:27.202 align:middle line:90%
It's not necessarily business.

00:29:27.202 --> 00:29:28.410 align:middle line:90%
It could be raising a family.

00:29:28.410 --> 00:29:31.070 align:middle line:90%
It's whatever you love to do.

00:29:31.070 --> 00:29:34.930 align:middle line:84%
It's whatever you are called
upon to do in your life.

00:29:34.930 --> 00:29:36.810 align:middle line:90%
And so that's the builder phase.

00:29:36.810 --> 00:29:38.810 align:middle line:90%
And you develop competency.

00:29:38.810 --> 00:29:40.930 align:middle line:84%
So in stage one, you
develop some skills.

00:29:40.930 --> 00:29:42.930 align:middle line:84%
You try things, and you
see what you like to do,

00:29:42.930 --> 00:29:44.870 align:middle line:84%
and you develop skills
as much as you can.

00:29:44.870 --> 00:29:47.770 align:middle line:84%
In the builder stage,
you amplify those skills,

00:29:47.770 --> 00:29:49.910 align:middle line:84%
and you provide for
yourself and others.

00:29:49.910 --> 00:29:53.350 align:middle line:84%
And then around age
58 to 60, it depends--

00:29:53.350 --> 00:29:55.050 align:middle line:90%
these are fuzzy boundaries.

00:29:55.050 --> 00:29:57.280 align:middle line:84%
But stage three
starts, and that's

00:29:57.280 --> 00:30:01.700 align:middle line:84%
the patron stage or the sponsor
or philanthropist or mentor.

00:30:01.700 --> 00:30:05.220 align:middle line:84%
That's the stage of
giving back and supporting

00:30:05.220 --> 00:30:06.330 align:middle line:90%
future generations.

00:30:06.330 --> 00:30:08.717 align:middle line:84%
That's the stage of
creating a legacy.

00:30:08.717 --> 00:30:11.050 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: OK, now I'm going
to bring a couple things up.

00:30:11.050 --> 00:30:13.420 align:middle line:84%
One, on that second
stage you're talking

00:30:13.420 --> 00:30:15.490 align:middle line:84%
about-- even the
first stage-- I love

00:30:15.490 --> 00:30:19.380 align:middle line:84%
this quote you put in by
Rumi, which is respond

00:30:19.380 --> 00:30:22.960 align:middle line:84%
to every call that excites your
spirit, which to me is the best

00:30:22.960 --> 00:30:24.970 align:middle line:90%
mantra one could have.

00:30:24.970 --> 00:30:27.872 align:middle line:84%
I mean that should be
writ large as they say.

00:30:27.872 --> 00:30:28.580 align:middle line:90%
>>O'BRIEN: Right.

00:30:28.580 --> 00:30:30.663 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: On our windshield
when we get in the car

00:30:30.663 --> 00:30:32.480 align:middle line:90%
or on our mirror in the morning.

00:30:32.480 --> 00:30:36.510 align:middle line:84%
>>O'BRIEN: In the book, I
tell the story of-- there's

00:30:36.510 --> 00:30:38.980 align:middle line:90%
a chapter called self-knowledge.

00:30:38.980 --> 00:30:44.410 align:middle line:84%
And I tell the story of
how I had two fascinations

00:30:44.410 --> 00:30:45.840 align:middle line:90%
during my stage one.

00:30:45.840 --> 00:30:48.290 align:middle line:84%
There were two things that
utterly fascinated me.

00:30:48.290 --> 00:30:50.290 align:middle line:84%
One of them was
the I Ching, which

00:30:50.290 --> 00:30:51.760 align:middle line:90%
I learned about when I was 19--

00:30:51.760 --> 00:30:52.690 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: To a girl.

00:30:52.690 --> 00:30:53.356 align:middle line:90%
>>O'BRIEN: Yeah.

00:30:53.356 --> 00:30:54.780 align:middle line:90%
It was a coed at Berkeley.

00:30:54.780 --> 00:30:56.200 align:middle line:90%
I was an undergrad.

00:30:56.200 --> 00:30:58.060 align:middle line:84%
And then the second
one was software which

00:30:58.060 --> 00:30:59.504 align:middle line:90%
I discovered a few years later.

00:30:59.504 --> 00:31:01.170 align:middle line:84%
Now this was in the
day when we didn't--

00:31:01.170 --> 00:31:03.019 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: A computer
was the size of a room.

00:31:03.019 --> 00:31:03.810 align:middle line:90%
>>O'BRIEN: Exactly.

00:31:03.810 --> 00:31:07.700 align:middle line:84%
There were no-- Apple
didn't exist yet.

00:31:07.700 --> 00:31:12.910 align:middle line:84%
But I played a computer game
on this ginormous machine

00:31:12.910 --> 00:31:15.210 align:middle line:90%
called a mini-computer.

00:31:15.210 --> 00:31:16.590 align:middle line:90%
That would take up a whole room.

00:31:16.590 --> 00:31:16.782 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Half a room?

00:31:16.782 --> 00:31:17.390 align:middle line:90%
Yeah, a whole room.

00:31:17.390 --> 00:31:18.200 align:middle line:90%
>>O'BRIEN: Yeah.

00:31:18.200 --> 00:31:20.560 align:middle line:84%
It had less power than
my iPhone has today.

00:31:20.560 --> 00:31:21.410 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Isn't
that just shocking?

00:31:21.410 --> 00:31:22.826 align:middle line:84%
>>O'BRIEN: And I
played this game,

00:31:22.826 --> 00:31:26.670 align:middle line:84%
and it turned me on to the
whole concept of software.

00:31:26.670 --> 00:31:28.570 align:middle line:84%
I mean, I've never
been a big gamer.

00:31:28.570 --> 00:31:31.510 align:middle line:84%
I'm not against it, but I've
just never been a big game

00:31:31.510 --> 00:31:33.330 align:middle line:90%
player on computers.

00:31:33.330 --> 00:31:34.192 align:middle line:90%
But--

00:31:34.192 --> 00:31:36.150 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: What kind of
game was it, by the way?

00:31:36.150 --> 00:31:38.510 align:middle line:84%
>>O'BRIEN: It was a space--
it was called Space War.

00:31:38.510 --> 00:31:39.610 align:middle line:90%
And it was done at MIT.

00:31:39.610 --> 00:31:41.110 align:middle line:84%
And there's this
tiny little screen,

00:31:41.110 --> 00:31:44.190 align:middle line:84%
which is an oscilloscope driven
by this humongous machine.

00:31:44.190 --> 00:31:46.080 align:middle line:84%
And we would go
there late at night.

00:31:46.080 --> 00:31:49.624 align:middle line:84%
And we'd smoke some pot and
have a really good time.

00:31:49.624 --> 00:31:51.540 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Were you blowing
stuff up, I assume?

00:31:51.540 --> 00:31:51.910 align:middle line:90%
Space wars.

00:31:51.910 --> 00:31:52.530 align:middle line:90%
>>O'BRIEN: Yeah, that's right.

00:31:52.530 --> 00:31:52.990 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:31:52.990 --> 00:31:53.810 align:middle line:84%
>>O'BRIEN: There were
two little spaceships

00:31:53.810 --> 00:31:55.620 align:middle line:84%
that would fight with each
other-- very, very primitive.

00:31:55.620 --> 00:31:55.820 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:31:55.820 --> 00:31:57.210 align:middle line:84%
>>O'BRIEN: There was
a few pixels each,

00:31:57.210 --> 00:31:58.001 align:middle line:90%
that kind of thing.

00:31:58.001 --> 00:32:00.400 align:middle line:84%
And my friend was the programmer
at this computer center,

00:32:00.400 --> 00:32:01.480 align:middle line:90%
so he had the keys.

00:32:01.480 --> 00:32:02.600 align:middle line:90%
So we would go there--

00:32:02.600 --> 00:32:03.780 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: He was smoking
weed playing games.

00:32:03.780 --> 00:32:05.130 align:middle line:84%
>>O'BRIEN: Yeah, we
would get really high,

00:32:05.130 --> 00:32:06.190 align:middle line:90%
and we'd play this game.

00:32:06.190 --> 00:32:10.640 align:middle line:84%
And I remember thinking, wow
this is really phenomenal

00:32:10.640 --> 00:32:13.160 align:middle line:84%
that somebody could
write code and deliver

00:32:13.160 --> 00:32:14.650 align:middle line:90%
an interactive experience.

00:32:14.650 --> 00:32:19.599 align:middle line:84%
And I started having visions
of multimedia in the early '70s

00:32:19.599 --> 00:32:20.390 align:middle line:90%
when that happened.

00:32:20.390 --> 00:32:24.800 align:middle line:84%
I thought, oh I wonder
what else could be done.

00:32:24.800 --> 00:32:27.690 align:middle line:84%
Of course, that was 20
years before we had CD-ROMs.

00:32:27.690 --> 00:32:30.410 align:middle line:84%
But it was just a
fascination of mine,

00:32:30.410 --> 00:32:32.610 align:middle line:84%
and I made a
commitment to-- I just

00:32:32.610 --> 00:32:35.250 align:middle line:84%
was so fascinated with
software, that I decided to get

00:32:35.250 --> 00:32:36.720 align:middle line:90%
into the software business.

00:32:36.720 --> 00:32:39.812 align:middle line:84%
And that's when I started
out as a secretary.

00:32:39.812 --> 00:32:41.020 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: I was going to say.

00:32:41.020 --> 00:32:43.330 align:middle line:84%
You had secretarial skills you
had to develop along the way.

00:32:43.330 --> 00:32:45.090 align:middle line:84%
>>O'BRIEN: I could
type 70 words a minute.

00:32:45.090 --> 00:32:45.450 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: That's right.

00:32:45.450 --> 00:32:47.130 align:middle line:84%
>>O'BRIEN: And my
first job at software

00:32:47.130 --> 00:32:50.790 align:middle line:84%
was I was the secretary
at that computer center,

00:32:50.790 --> 00:32:52.290 align:middle line:90%
because I was fascinated.

00:32:52.290 --> 00:32:56.250 align:middle line:84%
And so in this chapter in the
book about self-discovery,

00:32:56.250 --> 00:33:00.017 align:middle line:84%
I talk about discover
your fascinations.

00:33:00.017 --> 00:33:01.600 align:middle line:84%
And that's what Rumi
is talking about.

00:33:01.600 --> 00:33:01.930 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:33:01.930 --> 00:33:03.580 align:middle line:84%
>>O'BRIEN: The things
that excite your spirit.

00:33:03.580 --> 00:33:03.980 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:33:03.980 --> 00:33:06.146 align:middle line:84%
>>O'BRIEN: It's going to
be different for everybody.

00:33:06.146 --> 00:33:09.980 align:middle line:84%
And I counsel people--
follow your fascinations.

00:33:09.980 --> 00:33:11.430 align:middle line:90%
Figure out what they are.

00:33:11.430 --> 00:33:13.010 align:middle line:90%
Allow yourself to have them.

00:33:13.010 --> 00:33:15.201 align:middle line:84%
If you put yourself
lockstep into some program

00:33:15.201 --> 00:33:17.700 align:middle line:84%
where you're going to become a
lawyer because your father is

00:33:17.700 --> 00:33:19.400 align:middle line:84%
a lawyer, or you're
going to become

00:33:19.400 --> 00:33:21.580 align:middle line:84%
a doctor because your
mother is a doctor,

00:33:21.580 --> 00:33:23.430 align:middle line:84%
and she wants you
to be-- then you're

00:33:23.430 --> 00:33:25.820 align:middle line:84%
never going to have
a chance to discover

00:33:25.820 --> 00:33:27.230 align:middle line:90%
what truly fascinates you.

00:33:27.230 --> 00:33:30.390 align:middle line:90%
Or you're liable to discount it.

00:33:30.390 --> 00:33:34.970 align:middle line:84%
15 years later, after
I started in software,

00:33:34.970 --> 00:33:40.130 align:middle line:84%
I was the VP of marketing for a
software company by that point.

00:33:40.130 --> 00:33:41.819 align:middle line:84%
And I found myself
using the I Ching

00:33:41.819 --> 00:33:43.110 align:middle line:90%
a little more often than usual.

00:33:43.110 --> 00:33:45.572 align:middle line:84%
And I thought, God,
it sure would be nice

00:33:45.572 --> 00:33:47.030 align:middle line:84%
if I could do this
on the computer.

00:33:47.030 --> 00:33:48.740 align:middle line:90%
And then all of a sudden, bing.

00:33:48.740 --> 00:33:52.910 align:middle line:84%
I remembered my visions of
multimedia that had fascinated

00:33:52.910 --> 00:33:54.120 align:middle line:90%
me in the first place.

00:33:54.120 --> 00:33:55.730 align:middle line:84%
And multimedia
still wasn't there.

00:33:55.730 --> 00:33:56.870 align:middle line:90%
This was 1988.

00:33:56.870 --> 00:34:00.170 align:middle line:84%
There were no CD-ROMs
till about '93 or '94.

00:34:00.170 --> 00:34:03.410 align:middle line:84%
But I created this little-- I
took my entire life savings,

00:34:03.410 --> 00:34:07.630 align:middle line:84%
because I was so enamored
of this intersection

00:34:07.630 --> 00:34:09.789 align:middle line:84%
between the two things
that fascinated me.

00:34:09.789 --> 00:34:12.080 align:middle line:84%
And so when I was writing
this book, I remembered that.

00:34:12.080 --> 00:34:16.469 align:middle line:84%
I thought, that's what
these kids in stage one

00:34:16.469 --> 00:34:20.310 align:middle line:84%
need to be allowed
to do-- to discover

00:34:20.310 --> 00:34:22.330 align:middle line:90%
something that fascinates them.

00:34:22.330 --> 00:34:24.739 align:middle line:84%
Or maybe a couple things
that fascinate them.

00:34:24.739 --> 00:34:27.450 align:middle line:84%
And so that's really what
Rumi is talking about

00:34:27.450 --> 00:34:28.699 align:middle line:90%
and I think it's so important.

00:34:28.699 --> 00:34:30.810 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Yeah, it doesn't
mean self-indulgence.

00:34:30.810 --> 00:34:31.860 align:middle line:90%
>>O'BRIEN: No.

00:34:31.860 --> 00:34:34.842 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: It's what really
gets your jets going.

00:34:34.842 --> 00:34:35.550 align:middle line:90%
>>O'BRIEN: Right.

00:34:35.550 --> 00:34:36.341 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: You know?

00:34:36.341 --> 00:34:38.170 align:middle line:90%
Your curiosity is up.

00:34:38.170 --> 00:34:40.075 align:middle line:84%
Your excited time
passes quickly.

00:34:40.075 --> 00:34:41.949 align:middle line:84%
>>O'BRIEN: And it doesn't
matter if you think

00:34:41.949 --> 00:34:43.230 align:middle line:90%
it's ever going to make money.

00:34:43.230 --> 00:34:44.550 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: No.

00:34:44.550 --> 00:34:48.480 align:middle line:84%
Now that's the real key that
has just crippled humanity.

00:34:48.480 --> 00:34:50.280 align:middle line:90%
>>O'BRIEN: Well I had a day job.

00:34:50.280 --> 00:34:53.199 align:middle line:84%
I learned some skills working
at the computer center.

00:34:53.199 --> 00:34:55.820 align:middle line:84%
I learned some marketing
skills, and I took some classes,

00:34:55.820 --> 00:34:59.980 align:middle line:84%
and I developed a career as a
software marketing specialist

00:34:59.980 --> 00:35:03.730 align:middle line:84%
before I ever took off
as an entrepreneur.

00:35:03.730 --> 00:35:07.530 align:middle line:84%
But when I created the
first divination software

00:35:07.530 --> 00:35:12.360 align:middle line:84%
in 1988, which was an I Ching
program called Synchronicity,

00:35:12.360 --> 00:35:14.640 align:middle line:84%
I never imagined
that it was ever

00:35:14.640 --> 00:35:16.350 align:middle line:90%
going to be very lucrative.

00:35:16.350 --> 00:35:19.120 align:middle line:84%
I mean, I was so far
ahead of my time.

00:35:19.120 --> 00:35:22.100 align:middle line:84%
In fact, I Ching software is
the least remunerative thing

00:35:22.100 --> 00:35:23.105 align:middle line:90%
I've ever done.

00:35:23.105 --> 00:35:23.730 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:35:23.730 --> 00:35:25.840 align:middle line:84%
>>O'BRIEN: Tarot was
20 times more popular.

00:35:25.840 --> 00:35:27.985 align:middle line:84%
And Astrology was 20 times
more popular than that.

00:35:27.985 --> 00:35:28.610 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:35:28.610 --> 00:35:30.860 align:middle line:84%
>>O'BRIEN: And that kind of
just happened organically,

00:35:30.860 --> 00:35:33.200 align:middle line:84%
but I had such a love--
I had such a fascination,

00:35:33.200 --> 00:35:34.970 align:middle line:90%
and I had some savings.

00:35:34.970 --> 00:35:38.130 align:middle line:84%
You know, I think in '88 I
had like $40,000 in the bank.

00:35:38.130 --> 00:35:40.410 align:middle line:84%
And I spent it all
to make a prototype,

00:35:40.410 --> 00:35:43.040 align:middle line:84%
because I got so
inflamed with enthusiasm

00:35:43.040 --> 00:35:46.905 align:middle line:84%
because my spirit was excited,
that I created this thing even

00:35:46.905 --> 00:35:49.030 align:middle line:84%
though there was no reason
to believe it would ever

00:35:49.030 --> 00:35:52.060 align:middle line:90%
amount to anything financially.

00:35:52.060 --> 00:35:55.210 align:middle line:84%
My motto was at the time-- when
people would say, why the hell

00:35:55.210 --> 00:35:56.140 align:middle line:90%
are you doing this?

00:35:56.140 --> 00:35:58.119 align:middle line:90%
You have a secure career.

00:35:58.119 --> 00:35:59.160 align:middle line:90%
You're making good money.

00:35:59.160 --> 00:36:00.550 align:middle line:90%
And I said, well I don't know.

00:36:00.550 --> 00:36:03.270 align:middle line:84%
It's like wherever God
drags me, I will follow.

00:36:03.270 --> 00:36:04.586 align:middle line:90%
I don't know what else to say.

00:36:04.586 --> 00:36:05.210 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:36:05.210 --> 00:36:06.959 align:middle line:84%
>>O'BRIEN: I just feel
compelled to do it,

00:36:06.959 --> 00:36:08.800 align:middle line:84%
because it's a
fascination of mine.

00:36:08.800 --> 00:36:12.500 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: But see the
thing is most people now--

00:36:12.500 --> 00:36:16.230 align:middle line:84%
especially in the economy of
the last decade or so-- are

00:36:16.230 --> 00:36:19.440 align:middle line:84%
so exhausted after they're
performing their day job--

00:36:19.440 --> 00:36:22.590 align:middle line:84%
maybe two day jobs, maybe two
day jobs and you come home

00:36:22.590 --> 00:36:23.580 align:middle line:90%
to kids--

00:36:23.580 --> 00:36:25.530 align:middle line:90%
>>O'BRIEN: Right.

00:36:25.530 --> 00:36:27.810 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: --that little
voice, that desire,

00:36:27.810 --> 00:36:30.480 align:middle line:84%
that thing that
speaks from your soul

00:36:30.480 --> 00:36:34.080 align:middle line:84%
can't be heard out
of pure exhaustion.

00:36:34.080 --> 00:36:35.040 align:middle line:90%
>>O'BRIEN: Right.

00:36:35.040 --> 00:36:37.730 align:middle line:90%
No question.

00:36:37.730 --> 00:36:38.940 align:middle line:90%
Yeah I was very lucky.

00:36:38.940 --> 00:36:40.565 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And then
finding your way out

00:36:40.565 --> 00:36:42.350 align:middle line:84%
of that, that's where
most people find--

00:36:42.350 --> 00:36:44.640 align:middle line:84%
a lot of people that find
their way to Gaiam TV,

00:36:44.640 --> 00:36:45.560 align:middle line:90%
it's for that reason.

00:36:45.560 --> 00:36:47.550 align:middle line:90%
It's like, this isn't it.

00:36:47.550 --> 00:36:49.230 align:middle line:90%
I know there's more out there.

00:36:49.230 --> 00:36:52.380 align:middle line:84%
But then you're so kind
of vested in survival

00:36:52.380 --> 00:36:54.730 align:middle line:84%
at that point, trying
to learn, which

00:36:54.730 --> 00:36:58.350 align:middle line:84%
is why you wrote this beautiful
book, that there is always

00:36:58.350 --> 00:37:00.190 align:middle line:84%
time to make a new
set of decisions

00:37:00.190 --> 00:37:04.090 align:middle line:84%
if you can just be quiet
enough to hear oneself.

00:37:04.090 --> 00:37:09.240 align:middle line:84%
>>O'BRIEN: You know,
this book doesn't really

00:37:09.240 --> 00:37:15.780 align:middle line:84%
tackle the problem of people
who are so deeply underwater

00:37:15.780 --> 00:37:18.280 align:middle line:90%
that they can't see straight.

00:37:18.280 --> 00:37:20.240 align:middle line:90%
Because they're so stressed out.

00:37:20.240 --> 00:37:22.500 align:middle line:90%
It's not--

00:37:22.500 --> 00:37:25.150 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Using intuition
almost seems a luxury that--

00:37:25.150 --> 00:37:25.420 align:middle line:90%
>>O'BRIEN: Right.

00:37:25.420 --> 00:37:26.130 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: --they can't
even follow up on.

00:37:26.130 --> 00:37:27.290 align:middle line:84%
>>O'BRIEN: They
don't have the time,

00:37:27.290 --> 00:37:28.670 align:middle line:90%
and they don't have the energy.

00:37:28.670 --> 00:37:34.820 align:middle line:84%
And the only thing I can say
is that sometimes there's

00:37:34.820 --> 00:37:36.710 align:middle line:90%
a reason for that, too.

00:37:36.710 --> 00:37:44.640 align:middle line:84%
Things get so stressful that we
basically take some bold risk

00:37:44.640 --> 00:37:47.260 align:middle line:90%
in order to get away from it.

00:37:47.260 --> 00:37:52.050 align:middle line:84%
But there's a lot of-- it's
just a shame that people

00:37:52.050 --> 00:37:53.190 align:middle line:90%
have to work that hard.

00:37:53.190 --> 00:37:57.324 align:middle line:84%
I worked 70 hour
weeks for 20 years

00:37:57.324 --> 00:37:59.990 align:middle line:84%
as a bootstrap entrepreneur when
I started that I Ching company.

00:37:59.990 --> 00:38:01.410 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:38:01.410 --> 00:38:03.360 align:middle line:84%
>>O'BRIEN: But at
least I was getting

00:38:03.360 --> 00:38:07.304 align:middle line:84%
the benefit of doing
something that fascinated me.

00:38:07.304 --> 00:38:07.970 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:38:07.970 --> 00:38:09.130 align:middle line:84%
>>O'BRIEN: That I was
enthusiastic about.

00:38:09.130 --> 00:38:10.490 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: It was your creation.

00:38:10.490 --> 00:38:13.290 align:middle line:84%
>>O'BRIEN: And you know, I
think that there's probably ways

00:38:13.290 --> 00:38:15.980 align:middle line:84%
that people can move
towards that if they

00:38:15.980 --> 00:38:18.694 align:middle line:90%
start to discover who they are.

00:38:18.694 --> 00:38:20.110 align:middle line:84%
A lot of people
never had a chance

00:38:20.110 --> 00:38:21.280 align:middle line:90%
to discover who they are.

00:38:21.280 --> 00:38:21.710 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: That's right.

00:38:21.710 --> 00:38:23.293 align:middle line:84%
>>O'BRIEN: The people
who are starving

00:38:23.293 --> 00:38:27.500 align:middle line:84%
in India-- they didn't really
have the luxury of a stage one.

00:38:27.500 --> 00:38:28.400 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: No.

00:38:28.400 --> 00:38:31.160 align:middle line:84%
>>O'BRIEN: So the book's
not written for everybody,

00:38:31.160 --> 00:38:33.980 align:middle line:84%
but it is written to try to
help us go to the next level.

00:38:33.980 --> 00:38:38.480 align:middle line:84%
Those of us that have a day job
that is supporting us-- we're

00:38:38.480 --> 00:38:41.040 align:middle line:84%
always going to have
a day job, by the way.

00:38:41.040 --> 00:38:44.520 align:middle line:84%
This idea that we're going to
be able to make a living only

00:38:44.520 --> 00:38:47.000 align:middle line:84%
doing what we love
and nothing else

00:38:47.000 --> 00:38:48.820 align:middle line:90%
is a little bit of a pipe dream.

00:38:48.820 --> 00:38:50.840 align:middle line:90%
I have a day job right now.

00:38:50.840 --> 00:38:54.136 align:middle line:84%
My day job is managing
my investments.

00:38:54.136 --> 00:38:56.010 align:middle line:84%
I mean, I'm not going
to complain about that.

00:38:56.010 --> 00:38:57.440 align:middle line:90%
Britney Spears has a day job.

00:38:57.440 --> 00:38:59.350 align:middle line:84%
She's got to manage
her managers.

00:38:59.350 --> 00:39:01.840 align:middle line:84%
She may have 25 people
managing her affairs,

00:39:01.840 --> 00:39:03.150 align:middle line:90%
but she's got to manage them.

00:39:03.150 --> 00:39:04.870 align:middle line:90%
So everybody's got to pay taxes.

00:39:04.870 --> 00:39:06.975 align:middle line:84%
Everybody's got
stuff they have to do

00:39:06.975 --> 00:39:08.100 align:middle line:90%
that they don't want to do.

00:39:08.100 --> 00:39:09.800 align:middle line:90%
I call that your day job.

00:39:09.800 --> 00:39:11.160 align:middle line:90%
Every artist has a day job.

00:39:11.160 --> 00:39:13.846 align:middle line:84%
I can't tell you how many
artists are dreaming of the day

00:39:13.846 --> 00:39:15.470 align:middle line:84%
when they don't have
to have a day job.

00:39:15.470 --> 00:39:17.970 align:middle line:84%
And I tell them, hey, you're
always going to have a day job.

00:39:17.970 --> 00:39:19.050 align:middle line:90%
It's OK.

00:39:19.050 --> 00:39:23.730 align:middle line:84%
Just accept the fact that you're
always going to have a day job,

00:39:23.730 --> 00:39:27.970 align:middle line:84%
but don't let it stop
you from discovering

00:39:27.970 --> 00:39:31.640 align:middle line:84%
what's inside of you
that you can get excited.

00:39:31.640 --> 00:39:33.980 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: That's a
really key point.

00:39:33.980 --> 00:39:36.620 align:middle line:84%
Now, after that
phase, after stage two

00:39:36.620 --> 00:39:39.300 align:middle line:84%
where you're really starting
to put your skills into action

00:39:39.300 --> 00:39:43.050 align:middle line:84%
and you're supporting
yourself and perhaps others,

00:39:43.050 --> 00:39:46.460 align:middle line:84%
then you have this line drawn
right around the age of 60.

00:39:46.460 --> 00:39:48.380 align:middle line:84%
Now, it was once
upon a time, that

00:39:48.380 --> 00:39:51.030 align:middle line:84%
was kind of coming close to
retirement age for people.

00:39:51.030 --> 00:39:51.738 align:middle line:90%
>>O'BRIEN: Right.

00:39:51.738 --> 00:39:53.692 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: That's really
more middle age now.

00:39:53.692 --> 00:39:54.400 align:middle line:90%
>>O'BRIEN: Right.

00:39:54.400 --> 00:39:56.900 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And a lot of
people-- 60 and 70--

00:39:56.900 --> 00:39:59.119 align:middle line:84%
are like everyone
else, scrambling just

00:39:59.119 --> 00:40:00.410 align:middle line:90%
to keep a roof over their head.

00:40:00.410 --> 00:40:01.460 align:middle line:84%
>>O'BRIEN: There's
a lot of people

00:40:01.460 --> 00:40:03.470 align:middle line:84%
that are going to be
working for a long time.

00:40:03.470 --> 00:40:04.440 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: A long time.

00:40:04.440 --> 00:40:05.856 align:middle line:84%
>>O'BRIEN:
Particularly the way we

00:40:05.856 --> 00:40:08.550 align:middle line:84%
have things structured
in our society now.

00:40:08.550 --> 00:40:12.250 align:middle line:84%
And at the same time, however,
the principles of stage three

00:40:12.250 --> 00:40:13.360 align:middle line:90%
do apply.

00:40:13.360 --> 00:40:15.856 align:middle line:84%
Everybody's going
to leave a legacy.

00:40:15.856 --> 00:40:16.620 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Mhm.

00:40:16.620 --> 00:40:20.320 align:middle line:84%
>>O'BRIEN: And I just-- I have a
radio show in Portland, Oregon.

00:40:20.320 --> 00:40:21.860 align:middle line:90%
I've had it now for 30 years.

00:40:21.860 --> 00:40:23.910 align:middle line:84%
And I interviewed a
guy a couple months ago

00:40:23.910 --> 00:40:26.469 align:middle line:84%
who wrote a book
about creating legacy.

00:40:26.469 --> 00:40:28.010 align:middle line:84%
And I thought, oh
that's interesting.

00:40:28.010 --> 00:40:29.210 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: What's his name?

00:40:29.210 --> 00:40:30.740 align:middle line:84%
>>O'BRIEN: His
name is Rick Wijo.

00:40:30.740 --> 00:40:31.310 align:middle line:90%
Joe

00:40:31.310 --> 00:40:31.889 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: OK.

00:40:31.889 --> 00:40:33.180 align:middle line:90%
>>O'BRIEN: I'll tell you later.

00:40:33.180 --> 00:40:33.721 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: OK.

00:40:33.721 --> 00:40:36.250 align:middle line:84%
>>O'BRIEN: And I
thought-- and he had been

00:40:36.250 --> 00:40:38.190 align:middle line:90%
a corporate guy for 35 years.

00:40:38.190 --> 00:40:40.170 align:middle line:84%
And three things
happened for him.

00:40:40.170 --> 00:40:43.830 align:middle line:84%
He got prostate cancer-- was
diagnosed with prostate cancer.

00:40:43.830 --> 00:40:46.720 align:middle line:84%
He had a grandchild,
and he found

00:40:46.720 --> 00:40:49.250 align:middle line:84%
kind of a family heirloom--
it wasn't really an heirloom.

00:40:49.250 --> 00:40:51.832 align:middle line:84%
It was a coin collection
that his grandfather

00:40:51.832 --> 00:40:52.540 align:middle line:90%
had left for him.

00:40:52.540 --> 00:40:54.415 align:middle line:84%
And it's up in the attic,
and he and his wife

00:40:54.415 --> 00:40:55.640 align:middle line:90%
are cleaning out the attic.

00:40:55.640 --> 00:40:58.240 align:middle line:84%
And they're thinking,
wow we can sell

00:40:58.240 --> 00:40:59.560 align:middle line:90%
some of this stuff on eBay.

00:40:59.560 --> 00:41:00.400 align:middle line:84%
And they're just
figuring out how

00:41:00.400 --> 00:41:01.440 align:middle line:90%
to get rid of all this stuff.

00:41:01.440 --> 00:41:02.027 align:middle line:90%
Right?

00:41:02.027 --> 00:41:03.610 align:middle line:84%
And so he's figuring
out, wow, I think

00:41:03.610 --> 00:41:07.130 align:middle line:84%
we can get something for
this coin collection.

00:41:07.130 --> 00:41:09.360 align:middle line:84%
And his wife goes,
well honey that's--

00:41:09.360 --> 00:41:11.300 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Your dad
left that for you.

00:41:11.300 --> 00:41:12.925 align:middle line:84%
>>O'BRIEN: Maybe you
should leave that.

00:41:12.925 --> 00:41:15.040 align:middle line:84%
And this opened his mind,
and he started exploring

00:41:15.040 --> 00:41:16.290 align:middle line:90%
this whole thing about legacy.

00:41:16.290 --> 00:41:17.330 align:middle line:90%
What is legacy?

00:41:17.330 --> 00:41:19.560 align:middle line:84%
And he started to
think, it's not

00:41:19.560 --> 00:41:22.900 align:middle line:84%
just what you leave behind
that your descendants have

00:41:22.900 --> 00:41:26.670 align:middle line:84%
to sort out according to
your will or whatever.

00:41:26.670 --> 00:41:28.460 align:middle line:84%
It's actually
something that we can

00:41:28.460 --> 00:41:32.264 align:middle line:84%
be creating in the last
quarter of our life.

00:41:32.264 --> 00:41:34.680 align:middle line:84%
And at that time, I hadn't
finished writing this book yet.

00:41:34.680 --> 00:41:35.596 align:middle line:90%
I was just about done.

00:41:35.596 --> 00:41:38.060 align:middle line:84%
I had, like, two more days
where I could edit things.

00:41:38.060 --> 00:41:41.730 align:middle line:84%
And so, I thought, well
that's what I'm doing.

00:41:41.730 --> 00:41:43.510 align:middle line:90%
That's what this book is about.

00:41:43.510 --> 00:41:44.540 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:41:44.540 --> 00:41:47.000 align:middle line:84%
>>O'BRIEN: I don't even
care about making profits

00:41:47.000 --> 00:41:48.130 align:middle line:90%
off this book.

00:41:48.130 --> 00:41:50.120 align:middle line:84%
So I dedicated the
book to my grandson

00:41:50.120 --> 00:41:51.716 align:middle line:90%
and all future decision makers.

00:41:51.716 --> 00:41:52.340 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:41:52.340 --> 00:41:53.805 align:middle line:84%
>>O'BRIEN: And it
just really kind

00:41:53.805 --> 00:41:54.930 align:middle line:90%
of clarified things for me.

00:41:54.930 --> 00:41:57.820 align:middle line:84%
And then I realized everybody
can create a legacy-- no matter

00:41:57.820 --> 00:41:58.570 align:middle line:90%
how busy they are.

00:41:58.570 --> 00:42:00.000 align:middle line:84%
They can at least
think like that,

00:42:00.000 --> 00:42:01.200 align:middle line:90%
and they can start to consider--

00:42:01.200 --> 00:42:02.991 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Oh yeah, even
if your grandmother

00:42:02.991 --> 00:42:05.260 align:middle line:84%
left her collection of
recipes to your mother, that's

00:42:05.260 --> 00:42:06.260 align:middle line:90%
a wonderful legacy.

00:42:06.260 --> 00:42:08.010 align:middle line:84%
>>O'BRIEN: Or even if
you write a letter--

00:42:08.010 --> 00:42:08.634 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:42:08.634 --> 00:42:10.000 align:middle line:90%
>>O'BRIEN: --to your niece.

00:42:10.000 --> 00:42:14.190 align:middle line:84%
You know, a legacy letter
they call it in his book.

00:42:14.190 --> 00:42:19.226 align:middle line:84%
But I was very inspired by that
and by the spirit of generosity

00:42:19.226 --> 00:42:20.100 align:middle line:90%
that comes from that.

00:42:20.100 --> 00:42:22.555 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: That's where we're
going next-- sacred economy.

00:42:22.555 --> 00:42:22.900 align:middle line:90%
>>O'BRIEN: Right.

00:42:22.900 --> 00:42:24.358 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And what
real wealth is--

00:42:24.358 --> 00:42:26.500 align:middle line:90%
accumulation versus generosity.

00:42:26.500 --> 00:42:28.420 align:middle line:90%
And you're very generous.

00:42:28.420 --> 00:42:29.700 align:middle line:90%
You're a generous person.

00:42:29.700 --> 00:42:32.605 align:middle line:84%
You offer a lot of your
work, like, the I Ching app.

00:42:32.605 --> 00:42:33.230 align:middle line:90%
It's out there.

00:42:33.230 --> 00:42:35.170 align:middle line:90%
You can download it free.

00:42:35.170 --> 00:42:38.070 align:middle line:84%
So let's talk about
what sacred economy is.

00:42:38.070 --> 00:42:40.890 align:middle line:84%
>>O'BRIEN: Well in that
book by Charles Eisenstein,

00:42:40.890 --> 00:42:45.070 align:middle line:84%
he points out that in
traditional societies--

00:42:45.070 --> 00:42:47.750 align:middle line:84%
in the tribal societies,
the hunter gatherer type

00:42:47.750 --> 00:42:50.950 align:middle line:84%
societies-- the
wealthiest person was

00:42:50.950 --> 00:42:55.330 align:middle line:84%
the one that gave the most,
that threw the biggest feasts.

00:42:55.330 --> 00:42:57.730 align:middle line:84%
And he tells a story about
how one tribal chief got

00:42:57.730 --> 00:43:00.260 align:middle line:84%
kind of upset, because
a woman in the tribe

00:43:00.260 --> 00:43:02.300 align:middle line:84%
had given a bigger
feast than he had given.

00:43:02.300 --> 00:43:04.940 align:middle line:84%
And so it's all about
the giving economy.

00:43:04.940 --> 00:43:09.130 align:middle line:84%
And when you feel interrelated
to everybody in the group,

00:43:09.130 --> 00:43:11.200 align:middle line:84%
that really works
because everybody

00:43:11.200 --> 00:43:14.370 align:middle line:84%
feels a sense of gratitude
and a sense of obligation

00:43:14.370 --> 00:43:14.960 align:middle line:90%
to give back.

00:43:14.960 --> 00:43:17.150 align:middle line:84%
And if you ever
need help, you're

00:43:17.150 --> 00:43:19.040 align:middle line:84%
going to be able to get
it when you need it.

00:43:19.040 --> 00:43:22.420 align:middle line:84%
And they say that that's really
the greatest security in life.

00:43:22.420 --> 00:43:23.410 align:middle line:90%
It's your community.

00:43:23.410 --> 00:43:24.880 align:middle line:90%
It's a network of your friends--

00:43:24.880 --> 00:43:25.320 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:43:25.320 --> 00:43:27.320 align:middle line:84%
>>O'BRIEN: --and the
people that care about you.

00:43:27.320 --> 00:43:29.225 align:middle line:84%
Because we all
depend on each other.

00:43:29.225 --> 00:43:31.980 align:middle line:90%


00:43:31.980 --> 00:43:33.840 align:middle line:84%
He talks about the
gifting economy.

00:43:33.840 --> 00:43:38.830 align:middle line:84%
And then I thought about how
I had actually inadvertently

00:43:38.830 --> 00:43:40.240 align:middle line:90%
experienced that myself.

00:43:40.240 --> 00:43:45.340 align:middle line:84%
Because when I did Tarot.com,
it was such a gamble

00:43:45.340 --> 00:43:47.680 align:middle line:90%
because it was new.

00:43:47.680 --> 00:43:50.990 align:middle line:84%
And I had no idea if this
thing was going to survive.

00:43:50.990 --> 00:43:53.670 align:middle line:90%
I was out on a limb 110%.

00:43:53.670 --> 00:43:55.211 align:middle line:84%
And I was having
nightmares about--

00:43:55.211 --> 00:43:56.960 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Did you still
have your day job?

00:43:56.960 --> 00:43:58.850 align:middle line:90%
>>O'BRIEN: No.

00:43:58.850 --> 00:44:01.020 align:middle line:84%
It's hard to have a day
job when you're working--

00:44:01.020 --> 00:44:03.140 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: When you're working 70
hours a week on the new thing.

00:44:03.140 --> 00:44:04.931 align:middle line:84%
>>O'BRIEN: We were
barely making ends meet.

00:44:04.931 --> 00:44:07.190 align:middle line:84%
We were eking it out,
but it was really tough.

00:44:07.190 --> 00:44:09.890 align:middle line:84%
And I had nightmares of
bankruptcy quite a bit.

00:44:09.890 --> 00:44:13.770 align:middle line:84%
But what I did at the end
of after about eight months

00:44:13.770 --> 00:44:17.300 align:middle line:84%
of operations, I had
invented this currency

00:44:17.300 --> 00:44:18.870 align:middle line:90%
called karma coins.

00:44:18.870 --> 00:44:20.710 align:middle line:84%
And they were like
virtual tokens.

00:44:20.710 --> 00:44:22.962 align:middle line:84%
And you could use them--
you could buy karma coins.

00:44:22.962 --> 00:44:24.420 align:middle line:84%
And if you bought
them in quantity,

00:44:24.420 --> 00:44:25.720 align:middle line:90%
it was like getting a discount.

00:44:25.720 --> 00:44:28.220 align:middle line:84%
And you could use them to give
yourself a tarot card reading

00:44:28.220 --> 00:44:29.678 align:middle line:84%
or give yourself
an I Ching reading

00:44:29.678 --> 00:44:31.370 align:middle line:90%
or get an astrology report.

00:44:31.370 --> 00:44:34.710 align:middle line:84%
And so we would give
you 100 karma coins

00:44:34.710 --> 00:44:36.340 align:middle line:90%
just for signing up.

00:44:36.340 --> 00:44:37.580 align:middle line:90%
So we would give you 100.

00:44:37.580 --> 00:44:39.070 align:middle line:90%
Now that wasn't generous.

00:44:39.070 --> 00:44:40.080 align:middle line:90%
That was an incentive.

00:44:40.080 --> 00:44:40.860 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:44:40.860 --> 00:44:42.580 align:middle line:84%
>>O'BRIEN: But then
the first New Year's

00:44:42.580 --> 00:44:45.140 align:middle line:84%
that came around, I said to my
staff, I said, you know what?

00:44:45.140 --> 00:44:47.930 align:middle line:84%
We've got 100,000 people
in our database now.

00:44:47.930 --> 00:44:50.460 align:middle line:84%
And I would like to give every
single one of them 50 karma

00:44:50.460 --> 00:44:53.540 align:middle line:84%
coins for New Year's and wish
them a happy and prosperous New

00:44:53.540 --> 00:44:54.040 align:middle line:90%
Year's.

00:44:54.040 --> 00:44:56.690 align:middle line:84%
And I said, it's going
to ding our numbers.

00:44:56.690 --> 00:44:57.670 align:middle line:90%
We're going to have--

00:44:57.670 --> 00:44:59.420 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: You're going
to have bad months.

00:44:59.420 --> 00:45:01.170 align:middle line:84%
>>O'BRIEN: It's going
to hurt financially,

00:45:01.170 --> 00:45:03.940 align:middle line:84%
but I want to do it and
just see what happens.

00:45:03.940 --> 00:45:05.350 align:middle line:90%
Oh my god.

00:45:05.350 --> 00:45:09.050 align:middle line:84%
It not only didn't hurt our
numbers, it tripled our sales.

00:45:09.050 --> 00:45:10.660 align:middle line:90%
And I thought, wow.

00:45:10.660 --> 00:45:12.570 align:middle line:84%
And so then I started
really doing it.

00:45:12.570 --> 00:45:14.804 align:middle line:84%
I said, OK from now on,
on anybody's birthday--

00:45:14.804 --> 00:45:16.470 align:middle line:84%
because we knew the
birthdays because it

00:45:16.470 --> 00:45:17.980 align:middle line:90%
was an astrology site.

00:45:17.980 --> 00:45:20.510 align:middle line:84%
On everybody's birthday,
you put 50 karma coins

00:45:20.510 --> 00:45:23.490 align:middle line:84%
as a birthday present with
a little note from me.

00:45:23.490 --> 00:45:24.580 align:middle line:90%
And so we would do that.

00:45:24.580 --> 00:45:26.140 align:middle line:84%
I'd run into people on the
street, and they'd go--

00:45:26.140 --> 00:45:27.723 align:middle line:84%
and I don't even
know them-- you know?

00:45:27.723 --> 00:45:29.445 align:middle line:84%
And they'd say, that
was so nice of you

00:45:29.445 --> 00:45:30.820 align:middle line:84%
to give me that
birthday present.

00:45:30.820 --> 00:45:32.528 align:middle line:84%
And so we just started
giving and giving.

00:45:32.528 --> 00:45:34.420 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: We're so
touched by generosity

00:45:34.420 --> 00:45:36.789 align:middle line:90%
on every level as human beings.

00:45:36.789 --> 00:45:39.330 align:middle line:84%
>>O'BRIEN: You could say it was
a cynical marketing strategy.

00:45:39.330 --> 00:45:41.764 align:middle line:84%
And it did work from
that point of view.

00:45:41.764 --> 00:45:43.430 align:middle line:84%
But that wasn't where
I was coming from.

00:45:43.430 --> 00:45:43.870 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:45:43.870 --> 00:45:45.720 align:middle line:84%
>>O'BRIEN: I just wanted to see
what-- it was kind of a Johnny

00:45:45.720 --> 00:45:46.722 align:middle line:90%
Appleseed thing.

00:45:46.722 --> 00:45:49.180 align:middle line:84%
I was trying to promote this
whole new way of doing things.

00:45:49.180 --> 00:45:49.805 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:45:49.805 --> 00:45:52.390 align:middle line:84%
>>O'BRIEN: And I wanted
to give it to people.

00:45:52.390 --> 00:45:53.890 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: One of
the things that you

00:45:53.890 --> 00:45:56.181 align:middle line:84%
started talking about-- you
touched on just a bit ago--

00:45:56.181 --> 00:45:59.680 align:middle line:84%
and that is, again, our
actual hierarchy of values.

00:45:59.680 --> 00:46:02.170 align:middle line:84%
And you and I have
both met, and I've

00:46:02.170 --> 00:46:04.340 align:middle line:84%
interviewed John Demartini
a couple of times.

00:46:04.340 --> 00:46:06.480 align:middle line:84%
And I think his work
is really brilliant,

00:46:06.480 --> 00:46:07.770 align:middle line:90%
and I think you do as well.

00:46:07.770 --> 00:46:09.126 align:middle line:90%
>>O'BRIEN: Oh yeah.

00:46:09.126 --> 00:46:11.830 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Kind of knocked
on from Maslow's hierarchy

00:46:11.830 --> 00:46:14.360 align:middle line:84%
of needs-- this
hierarchy of values

00:46:14.360 --> 00:46:20.360 align:middle line:84%
that we have-- that can't be
dictated, encouraged, given,

00:46:20.360 --> 00:46:21.470 align:middle line:90%
or anything like that.

00:46:21.470 --> 00:46:22.832 align:middle line:90%
It's so unique to each of us.

00:46:22.832 --> 00:46:23.540 align:middle line:90%
>>O'BRIEN: Right.

00:46:23.540 --> 00:46:25.490 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And talk
about the necessity

00:46:25.490 --> 00:46:28.672 align:middle line:84%
of us finding out, truly
finding out what that is.

00:46:28.672 --> 00:46:30.130 align:middle line:84%
>>O'BRIEN: Well
there's two reasons

00:46:30.130 --> 00:46:33.320 align:middle line:84%
to be highly conscious of what
your hierarchy of values is.

00:46:33.320 --> 00:46:37.050 align:middle line:84%
One is so that you can make
better decisions based on what

00:46:37.050 --> 00:46:38.330 align:middle line:90%
your highest values are.

00:46:38.330 --> 00:46:39.830 align:middle line:84%
And the second one
is you might want

00:46:39.830 --> 00:46:41.920 align:middle line:84%
to change your
hierarchy of values

00:46:41.920 --> 00:46:43.600 align:middle line:90%
once you realize what they are.

00:46:43.600 --> 00:46:45.930 align:middle line:84%
And the thing I loved
about his system

00:46:45.930 --> 00:46:50.300 align:middle line:84%
was his way of analyzing
how you can figure out

00:46:50.300 --> 00:46:52.990 align:middle line:84%
what your true
hierarchy of values is.

00:46:52.990 --> 00:46:54.940 align:middle line:84%
And when he uses
the word values,

00:46:54.940 --> 00:46:56.900 align:middle line:90%
he's not talking about ideals.

00:46:56.900 --> 00:46:57.520 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: No.

00:46:57.520 --> 00:47:00.190 align:middle line:84%
>>O'BRIEN: And he's not
talking about philosophy.

00:47:00.190 --> 00:47:04.060 align:middle line:84%
He's talking about the
things that you actually

00:47:04.060 --> 00:47:08.600 align:middle line:84%
spend the most time
and energy and money

00:47:08.600 --> 00:47:12.230 align:middle line:84%
and thinking about-- the things
that you think about or do

00:47:12.230 --> 00:47:15.400 align:middle line:84%
the most-- those are your
highest values in his very

00:47:15.400 --> 00:47:16.930 align:middle line:90%
pragmatic system.

00:47:16.930 --> 00:47:20.270 align:middle line:84%
So if you're working
70 hours a week,

00:47:20.270 --> 00:47:22.120 align:middle line:84%
that's your highest
value, because that's

00:47:22.120 --> 00:47:24.210 align:middle line:84%
by far the thing you're
spending the most time on.

00:47:24.210 --> 00:47:26.257 align:middle line:84%
Now, you can interpret
that and boil it down.

00:47:26.257 --> 00:47:27.090 align:middle line:90%
What does that mean?

00:47:27.090 --> 00:47:30.660 align:middle line:84%
Well it could be survival,
or it could be ambition,

00:47:30.660 --> 00:47:33.680 align:middle line:84%
or it could be
whatever your goal is.

00:47:33.680 --> 00:47:35.770 align:middle line:84%
But it really is
very, very important

00:47:35.770 --> 00:47:39.680 align:middle line:84%
for us to know what
our hierarchy of values

00:47:39.680 --> 00:47:42.420 align:middle line:84%
is so that we can
skillfully answer

00:47:42.420 --> 00:47:45.204 align:middle line:84%
that first intuitive
decision making question--

00:47:45.204 --> 00:47:47.120 align:middle line:84%
the first visionary
decision making question--

00:47:47.120 --> 00:47:51.990 align:middle line:84%
which is, what is the
best next move to make?

00:47:51.990 --> 00:47:55.360 align:middle line:84%
And if we're not clear
about what we want,

00:47:55.360 --> 00:47:58.880 align:middle line:84%
most people would say--
most people could easily say

00:47:58.880 --> 00:48:02.560 align:middle line:84%
and a lot of people do, they
say, I don't know what I want,

00:48:02.560 --> 00:48:04.230 align:middle line:90%
but I'm damn sure this isn't it.

00:48:04.230 --> 00:48:05.290 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:48:05.290 --> 00:48:06.960 align:middle line:84%
We know through pain
what we don't want.

00:48:06.960 --> 00:48:07.959 align:middle line:90%
>>O'BRIEN: That's right.

00:48:07.959 --> 00:48:09.000 align:middle line:90%
And it's too easy.

00:48:09.000 --> 00:48:10.790 align:middle line:84%
That's not going to
get you what you want.

00:48:10.790 --> 00:48:12.540 align:middle line:84%
Just being clear about
what you don't want

00:48:12.540 --> 00:48:14.206 align:middle line:84%
is never going to get
you what you want.

00:48:14.206 --> 00:48:17.180 align:middle line:84%
It can be helpful in some
circumstances to avoid things,

00:48:17.180 --> 00:48:20.730 align:middle line:84%
but we have to get clear
about what we want.

00:48:20.730 --> 00:48:23.670 align:middle line:84%
And I call that in
the book formulating

00:48:23.670 --> 00:48:25.440 align:middle line:90%
your strategic vision.

00:48:25.440 --> 00:48:27.370 align:middle line:84%
And there's a
whole logic process

00:48:27.370 --> 00:48:29.000 align:middle line:90%
that can enter into that, too.

00:48:29.000 --> 00:48:32.214 align:middle line:84%
And Demartini's hierarchy of
values is a logical process--

00:48:32.214 --> 00:48:33.630 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: It is a
logical process.

00:48:33.630 --> 00:48:35.280 align:middle line:84%
>>O'BRIEN: --of determining
that, what you're--

00:48:35.280 --> 00:48:36.980 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: But it's
really valuable.

00:48:36.980 --> 00:48:41.760 align:middle line:84%
As he says, if
you're a woman who

00:48:41.760 --> 00:48:44.410 align:middle line:84%
is beating her head
against a wall,

00:48:44.410 --> 00:48:47.030 align:middle line:84%
trying to climb through a
corporate situation that causes

00:48:47.030 --> 00:48:49.392 align:middle line:84%
nothing but pain when all
she really is spending

00:48:49.392 --> 00:48:51.100 align:middle line:84%
her time thinking
about and wanting to do

00:48:51.100 --> 00:48:52.670 align:middle line:90%
is to be home with her kids.

00:48:52.670 --> 00:48:53.480 align:middle line:90%
>>O'BRIEN: Right.

00:48:53.480 --> 00:48:54.540 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: This is common.

00:48:54.540 --> 00:48:55.206 align:middle line:90%
>>O'BRIEN: Yeah.

00:48:55.206 --> 00:48:59.210 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: OK so what happens in
there once you've identified I

00:48:59.210 --> 00:49:00.484 align:middle line:90%
don't want to be doing that.

00:49:00.484 --> 00:49:01.900 align:middle line:84%
I want to spend
time with my kids.

00:49:01.900 --> 00:49:04.025 align:middle line:84%
I want to be there to help
them with their homework

00:49:04.025 --> 00:49:06.520 align:middle line:84%
and drive them to practice
and all that sort of thing.

00:49:06.520 --> 00:49:06.910 align:middle line:90%
>>O'BRIEN: Right.

00:49:06.910 --> 00:49:08.490 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: This is where
life gets complex.

00:49:08.490 --> 00:49:09.880 align:middle line:84%
>>O'BRIEN: Yeah, well
we're conflicted.

00:49:09.880 --> 00:49:10.540 align:middle line:90%
No question.

00:49:10.540 --> 00:49:14.580 align:middle line:84%
And there's no-- there's
probably no way to ever

00:49:14.580 --> 00:49:16.024 align:middle line:90%
be completely conflict free.

00:49:16.024 --> 00:49:16.690 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:49:16.690 --> 00:49:19.244 align:middle line:84%
>>O'BRIEN: It's just part
of the process of life.

00:49:19.244 --> 00:49:21.160 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: But knowing
that makes a difference.

00:49:21.160 --> 00:49:21.490 align:middle line:90%
>>O'BRIEN: Right.

00:49:21.490 --> 00:49:22.906 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Then
maybe you say, hey,

00:49:22.906 --> 00:49:25.240 align:middle line:84%
OK this isn't the
best position for me.

00:49:25.240 --> 00:49:27.030 align:middle line:84%
Maybe I need to shift
to where I'm working

00:49:27.030 --> 00:49:28.470 align:middle line:90%
three days from my home.

00:49:28.470 --> 00:49:31.330 align:middle line:84%
I mean, you find ways
around it once you know--

00:49:31.330 --> 00:49:33.030 align:middle line:90%
once you're true with yourself.

00:49:33.030 --> 00:49:36.097 align:middle line:84%
I did that with my media career
when I was raising my son.

00:49:36.097 --> 00:49:37.930 align:middle line:84%
I'm going to become an
independent-- get out

00:49:37.930 --> 00:49:40.560 align:middle line:84%
of news-- independent
producer, so I

00:49:40.560 --> 00:49:43.000 align:middle line:84%
can be there for my son's
games, take him to school,

00:49:43.000 --> 00:49:45.800 align:middle line:84%
pick him up, and make his
little lunches for him.

00:49:45.800 --> 00:49:46.970 align:middle line:90%
And it worked for us.

00:49:46.970 --> 00:49:47.320 align:middle line:90%
>>O'BRIEN: Right.

00:49:47.320 --> 00:49:48.620 align:middle line:90%
Yeah, it's not all or nothing.

00:49:48.620 --> 00:49:49.770 align:middle line:90%
That's our problem.

00:49:49.770 --> 00:49:51.930 align:middle line:84%
We tend to think in
black and white terms.

00:49:51.930 --> 00:49:54.310 align:middle line:84%
And I have a
counselor who's always

00:49:54.310 --> 00:49:57.620 align:middle line:84%
reminding me there's more than
two solutions to any problem.

00:49:57.620 --> 00:49:59.274 align:middle line:90%
It's never black and white.

00:49:59.274 --> 00:49:59.940 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:49:59.940 --> 00:50:02.314 align:middle line:84%
And that's why I think where
John Demartini's work really

00:50:02.314 --> 00:50:04.550 align:middle line:84%
comes in and stops you
from lying to yourself.

00:50:04.550 --> 00:50:05.258 align:middle line:90%
>>O'BRIEN: Right.

00:50:05.258 --> 00:50:08.080 align:middle line:84%
And another thing to
remember is that while you

00:50:08.080 --> 00:50:13.480 align:middle line:84%
can have anything you want, you
can't have everything you want.

00:50:13.480 --> 00:50:14.260 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:50:14.260 --> 00:50:17.020 align:middle line:84%
>>O'BRIEN: And you can't have
everything you want right now.

00:50:17.020 --> 00:50:17.870 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:50:17.870 --> 00:50:21.500 align:middle line:84%
>>O'BRIEN: So life
is give and take.

00:50:21.500 --> 00:50:23.367 align:middle line:90%
It's a balancing act.

00:50:23.367 --> 00:50:25.700 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And you say one of
the big problems-- and this

00:50:25.700 --> 00:50:27.990 align:middle line:84%
comes to having
everything now-- is

00:50:27.990 --> 00:50:31.510 align:middle line:84%
that we have become a
society of consumers

00:50:31.510 --> 00:50:33.430 align:middle line:90%
rather than of producers.

00:50:33.430 --> 00:50:34.150 align:middle line:90%
>>O'BRIEN: Right.

00:50:34.150 --> 00:50:40.620 align:middle line:84%
And so when I'm talking about in
this chapter on self-knowledge

00:50:40.620 --> 00:50:47.990 align:middle line:84%
about what you want and getting
clear about what you want

00:50:47.990 --> 00:50:50.460 align:middle line:84%
and what your
highest values are,

00:50:50.460 --> 00:50:54.094 align:middle line:84%
I'm not including all the
things you want to consume.

00:50:54.094 --> 00:50:54.760 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:50:54.760 --> 00:50:56.176 align:middle line:84%
>>O'BRIEN: Or all
of the pleasures

00:50:56.176 --> 00:50:58.360 align:middle line:90%
that you want to experience.

00:50:58.360 --> 00:51:00.870 align:middle line:84%
This is really a
book about doing.

00:51:00.870 --> 00:51:04.650 align:middle line:84%
Decision making is
an active process.

00:51:04.650 --> 00:51:05.490 align:middle line:90%
It's a doing thing.

00:51:05.490 --> 00:51:10.540 align:middle line:84%
There's thinking behind it,
but it's not about consuming.

00:51:10.540 --> 00:51:15.070 align:middle line:84%
It's not about just
gratifying your impulses.

00:51:15.070 --> 00:51:18.707 align:middle line:84%
It's about doing something
that's meaningful to you.

00:51:18.707 --> 00:51:19.290 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:51:19.290 --> 00:51:20.956 align:middle line:84%
>>O'BRIEN: So the
self-knowledge process

00:51:20.956 --> 00:51:24.852 align:middle line:84%
has to do with discovering
what is meaningful for you.

00:51:24.852 --> 00:51:26.810 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And so we
already talked a little bit

00:51:26.810 --> 00:51:31.500 align:middle line:84%
earlier about how anxiety,
fear, impatience, and all

00:51:31.500 --> 00:51:34.720 align:middle line:84%
that can not only ruin
your intuitive sense,

00:51:34.720 --> 00:51:36.820 align:middle line:84%
it can also ruin the
timing of events.

00:51:36.820 --> 00:51:40.130 align:middle line:84%
So you really relate
back to Carl Jung

00:51:40.130 --> 00:51:43.640 align:middle line:84%
and the synchronicity
principle in terms of timing.

00:51:43.640 --> 00:51:47.300 align:middle line:84%
And he was a firm,
a staunch proponent,

00:51:47.300 --> 00:51:51.734 align:middle line:84%
of listening to the conscious--
the deep unconscious self,

00:51:51.734 --> 00:51:52.900 align:middle line:90%
I think is what he calls it.

00:51:52.900 --> 00:51:56.680 align:middle line:84%
We can call it higher self, call
it whatever it is-- the soul,

00:51:56.680 --> 00:51:59.872 align:middle line:84%
the infinite aspect of self that
is connected to all knowledge.

00:51:59.872 --> 00:52:00.580 align:middle line:90%
>>O'BRIEN: Right.

00:52:00.580 --> 00:52:03.060 align:middle line:84%
He called it the
collective unconscious.

00:52:03.060 --> 00:52:06.690 align:middle line:84%
The reason he called
it that was because he

00:52:06.690 --> 00:52:08.930 align:middle line:90%
was contrasting with Freud.

00:52:08.930 --> 00:52:14.300 align:middle line:84%
At that time in the
early days of psychology,

00:52:14.300 --> 00:52:18.340 align:middle line:84%
Freud had posited that
there was the unconscious.

00:52:18.340 --> 00:52:20.550 align:middle line:84%
And he was talking about
the personal unconscious.

00:52:20.550 --> 00:52:22.810 align:middle line:84%
And he defined it
as a repository

00:52:22.810 --> 00:52:29.586 align:middle line:84%
of all of this repressed dark
stuff, these libidinal urges.

00:52:29.586 --> 00:52:31.464 align:middle line:84%
It was kind of
where all neuroses--

00:52:31.464 --> 00:52:32.380 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: It was dark.

00:52:32.380 --> 00:52:32.830 align:middle line:90%
>>O'BRIEN: Yeah.

00:52:32.830 --> 00:52:33.950 align:middle line:90%
It's where all the neuroses--

00:52:33.950 --> 00:52:34.260 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:52:34.260 --> 00:52:35.840 align:middle line:84%
>>O'BRIEN: --and
worse came from.

00:52:35.840 --> 00:52:38.160 align:middle line:90%
And Jung said, wait a minute.

00:52:38.160 --> 00:52:40.570 align:middle line:84%
That doesn't really
explain a lot

00:52:40.570 --> 00:52:44.990 align:middle line:84%
of things that happen in
the human experience--

00:52:44.990 --> 00:52:52.590 align:middle line:84%
the creativity and intuition
and all of these marvelous ideas

00:52:52.590 --> 00:52:54.070 align:middle line:90%
that people develop.

00:52:54.070 --> 00:52:56.760 align:middle line:90%
And it doesn't explain that.

00:52:56.760 --> 00:52:59.620 align:middle line:90%
Where is this stuff coming from?

00:52:59.620 --> 00:53:01.310 align:middle line:90%
It doesn't explain dreams.

00:53:01.310 --> 00:53:04.767 align:middle line:84%
And it doesn't explain
the symbols in dreams.

00:53:04.767 --> 00:53:05.850 align:middle line:90%
Where is that coming from?

00:53:05.850 --> 00:53:08.720 align:middle line:84%
People would have these
really significant dreams

00:53:08.720 --> 00:53:10.790 align:middle line:84%
that were not
related to anything

00:53:10.790 --> 00:53:12.370 align:middle line:90%
they'd actually experienced.

00:53:12.370 --> 00:53:15.030 align:middle line:84%
And so he said, this
unconscious realm

00:53:15.030 --> 00:53:18.590 align:middle line:84%
is much bigger than this
personal dark corner

00:53:18.590 --> 00:53:20.010 align:middle line:90%
that Freud was defining.

00:53:20.010 --> 00:53:23.980 align:middle line:84%
And so he said, there's this
vast level of unconsciousness

00:53:23.980 --> 00:53:25.980 align:middle line:84%
that he called the
collective unconscious, which

00:53:25.980 --> 00:53:33.720 align:middle line:84%
is kind of a repository of
creativity and impressions,

00:53:33.720 --> 00:53:38.172 align:middle line:84%
images, archetypes,
symbols that actually--

00:53:38.172 --> 00:53:39.130 align:middle line:90%
and then he studied it.

00:53:39.130 --> 00:53:42.510 align:middle line:84%
And he studied all these
cultures and the same symbols

00:53:42.510 --> 00:53:46.440 align:middle line:84%
and the same archetypes are
present in the dreams of people

00:53:46.440 --> 00:53:49.130 align:middle line:84%
from all the different
cultures in the world.

00:53:49.130 --> 00:53:51.090 align:middle line:84%
And so he said,
this is a repository

00:53:51.090 --> 00:53:52.640 align:middle line:90%
that we're all privy to.

00:53:52.640 --> 00:53:54.050 align:middle line:84%
And I'm sure you've
heard or read

00:53:54.050 --> 00:53:56.130 align:middle line:84%
of stories where
somebody discovered

00:53:56.130 --> 00:53:59.070 align:middle line:84%
this and then at that same time,
two other people discovered--

00:53:59.070 --> 00:53:59.870 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Halfway
across the world.

00:53:59.870 --> 00:54:00.280 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:54:00.280 --> 00:54:00.905 align:middle line:90%
It's all there.

00:54:00.905 --> 00:54:02.552 align:middle line:84%
The information's
ready to be seeded.

00:54:02.552 --> 00:54:03.260 align:middle line:90%
>>O'BRIEN: Right.

00:54:03.260 --> 00:54:03.510 align:middle line:90%
Right.

00:54:03.510 --> 00:54:04.051 align:middle line:90%
That's right.

00:54:04.051 --> 00:54:07.510 align:middle line:84%
And so what happened was three
people whose intuitions were

00:54:07.510 --> 00:54:09.550 align:middle line:84%
primed for that
type of information

00:54:09.550 --> 00:54:11.160 align:middle line:84%
received it at
about the same time.

00:54:11.160 --> 00:54:11.826 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:54:11.826 --> 00:54:14.830 align:middle line:84%
>>O'BRIEN: From the
same cosmic source.

00:54:14.830 --> 00:54:17.290 align:middle line:84%
I call it infinite
intelligence, which is

00:54:17.290 --> 00:54:20.120 align:middle line:90%
what Napoleon Hill called it.

00:54:20.120 --> 00:54:24.330 align:middle line:84%
And the whole
purpose of intuition

00:54:24.330 --> 00:54:29.180 align:middle line:84%
is for that little antenna to
receive signals, impressions,

00:54:29.180 --> 00:54:33.570 align:middle line:84%
from the collective unconscious,
from this creative reservoir.

00:54:33.570 --> 00:54:35.950 align:middle line:84%
This creative
resource that we have.

00:54:35.950 --> 00:54:37.850 align:middle line:90%
So I defined it as a resource.

00:54:37.850 --> 00:54:40.410 align:middle line:84%
I used to say when I
was an entrepreneur-- I

00:54:40.410 --> 00:54:41.820 align:middle line:90%
had no investors.

00:54:41.820 --> 00:54:43.330 align:middle line:90%
Completely.

00:54:43.330 --> 00:54:47.440 align:middle line:84%
Nobody could believe that
I Ching software would ever

00:54:47.440 --> 00:54:49.357 align:middle line:90%
amount to anything.

00:54:49.357 --> 00:54:50.940 align:middle line:84%
So I didn't even try
to get investors.

00:54:50.940 --> 00:54:53.670 align:middle line:90%
And I couldn't get financing.

00:54:53.670 --> 00:54:57.470 align:middle line:84%
But people would ask me,
do you have any investors?

00:54:57.470 --> 00:55:03.190 align:middle line:84%
And I would say, yes, my
backer has infinite resources.

00:55:03.190 --> 00:55:04.810 align:middle line:90%
And I was kind of counting on--

00:55:04.810 --> 00:55:06.310 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Something
happening there.

00:55:06.310 --> 00:55:08.851 align:middle line:84%
>>O'BRIEN: --coming up with the
right idea at the right time.

00:55:08.851 --> 00:55:11.860 align:middle line:84%
But so we have this reservoir
that we can tune in to.

00:55:11.860 --> 00:55:15.020 align:middle line:84%
The problem is our intuitive
antenna is so blocked

00:55:15.020 --> 00:55:18.380 align:middle line:84%
and it's so distracted by all
of the noise in the system

00:55:18.380 --> 00:55:22.067 align:middle line:84%
and all of the strong
emotions that it's not

00:55:22.067 --> 00:55:23.900 align:middle line:84%
able to receive these
signals, because these

00:55:23.900 --> 00:55:24.790 align:middle line:90%
are very fine signals.

00:55:24.790 --> 00:55:25.581 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: They are.

00:55:25.581 --> 00:55:28.060 align:middle line:84%
And this brings us-- as
we're winding down our chat

00:55:28.060 --> 00:55:31.040 align:middle line:84%
here-- brings us to the notion
of the infinite intelligence

00:55:31.040 --> 00:55:32.850 align:middle line:84%
and wisdom that
we all have access

00:55:32.850 --> 00:55:37.160 align:middle line:84%
to that's always trying to speak
to us if we would only listen.

00:55:37.160 --> 00:55:37.860 align:middle line:90%
And the heart.

00:55:37.860 --> 00:55:38.860 align:middle line:90%
>>O'BRIEN: That's right.

00:55:38.860 --> 00:55:40.443 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: The heart
precedes the mind.

00:55:40.443 --> 00:55:42.152 align:middle line:84%
>>O'BRIEN: That's a
great cause for hope.

00:55:42.152 --> 00:55:42.734 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:55:42.734 --> 00:55:44.930 align:middle line:10%
>>O'BRIEN: No matter how
desperate somebody feels,

00:55:44.930 --> 00:55:47.080 align:middle line:10%
it's really helpful
to realize that there

00:55:47.080 --> 00:55:50.220 align:middle line:10%
is this reservoir of creative
intelligence out there

00:55:50.220 --> 00:55:52.170 align:middle line:10%
that is there for us.

00:55:52.170 --> 00:55:55.850 align:middle line:10%
It's not like a deity that's
judging us and deciding

00:55:55.850 --> 00:55:57.930 align:middle line:10%
whether we deserve
its help or not.

00:55:57.930 --> 00:56:03.520 align:middle line:84%
It's an unlimited resource
that's always there for us.

00:56:03.520 --> 00:56:06.289 align:middle line:84%
The only thing we have
to do is tap into it.

00:56:06.289 --> 00:56:07.830 align:middle line:84%
The only thing we
have to do is learn

00:56:07.830 --> 00:56:11.700 align:middle line:84%
how to be receptive,
learn how to calm down

00:56:11.700 --> 00:56:13.960 align:middle line:84%
and do some
mindfulness techniques,

00:56:13.960 --> 00:56:16.480 align:middle line:84%
and let our intuition
receive what's there for us.

00:56:16.480 --> 00:56:18.480 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And I love what
you did with the book,

00:56:18.480 --> 00:56:21.050 align:middle line:84%
because it takes us through
the background-- some

00:56:21.050 --> 00:56:23.980 align:middle line:84%
of the science,
logical processes.

00:56:23.980 --> 00:56:27.050 align:middle line:84%
It's well referenced
without being overly so.

00:56:27.050 --> 00:56:29.337 align:middle line:84%
And into, again, the
more quiet practice.

00:56:29.337 --> 00:56:30.420 align:middle line:90%
>>O'BRIEN: Well thank you.

00:56:30.420 --> 00:56:31.560 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: You did
a beautiful job.

00:56:31.560 --> 00:56:32.980 align:middle line:90%
>>O'BRIEN: Thank you very much.

00:56:32.980 --> 00:56:34.260 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Thank you, Paul.

00:56:34.260 --> 00:56:36.870 align:middle line:10%
Again, the title of Paul's
book is "Great Decisions,

00:56:36.870 --> 00:56:38.040 align:middle line:10%
Perfect Timing."

00:56:38.040 --> 00:56:40.300 align:middle line:84%
Meanwhile, you might want
to watch my first interview

00:56:40.300 --> 00:56:42.450 align:middle line:84%
with Paul in the
Gaiam TV archives.

00:56:42.450 --> 00:56:46.610 align:middle line:84%
Until next time, thank you for
joining us here on Gaiam TV.

00:56:46.610 --> 00:56:53.167 align:middle line:90%
