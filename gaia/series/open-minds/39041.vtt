00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.236 align:middle line:84%
>> Regina Meredith: Today
we're going to be talking

00:00:03.236 --> 00:00:05.605 align:middle line:84%
about an agenda that reaches far
beyond any political, social,

00:00:05.605 --> 00:00:07.841 align:middle line:90%
racial, or economic beliefs.

00:00:07.841 --> 00:00:11.044 align:middle line:84%
It's one that affects most of
the people in America, Canada,

00:00:11.044 --> 00:00:14.981 align:middle line:84%
the UK, even Bulgaria, and is
fast becoming a global agenda.

00:00:14.981 --> 00:00:16.750 align:middle line:90%
It's called The Smart Grid.

00:00:16.750 --> 00:00:19.286 align:middle line:84%
It all starts when your
utility company comes

00:00:19.286 --> 00:00:23.290 align:middle line:84%
to your home unannounced, and
installs this devastating device

00:00:23.290 --> 00:00:26.092 align:middle line:84%
in place of your old
analog utility meter.

00:00:26.092 --> 00:00:29.229 align:middle line:84%
The story's almost
unbelievable but it's true.

00:00:29.229 --> 00:00:32.232 align:middle line:84%
The producer of the film "Take
Back Your Power," Josh Del Sol,

00:00:32.232 --> 00:00:36.503 align:middle line:84%
is with us today to explain
the terrifying truths behind

00:00:36.503 --> 00:00:37.904 align:middle line:90%
these devices.

00:00:37.904 --> 00:00:41.474 align:middle line:84%
I've been upset about this for a
long time and many people have,

00:00:41.474 --> 00:00:45.145 align:middle line:84%
but the film you did to me,
I just have to say up front,

00:00:45.145 --> 00:00:47.013 align:middle line:84%
I think is one of the
most important films

00:00:47.013 --> 00:00:48.615 align:middle line:90%
that have been produced today,

00:00:48.615 --> 00:00:51.985 align:middle line:84%
because it really
does cross all agendas

00:00:51.985 --> 00:00:56.223 align:middle line:84%
and makes people see how
insidious this agenda is

00:00:56.223 --> 00:00:59.292 align:middle line:84%
in taking our power away
from us on so many levels,

00:00:59.292 --> 00:01:01.928 align:middle line:84%
so I just want to
applaud you up front,

00:01:01.928 --> 00:01:03.830 align:middle line:90%
phenomenal job that you've done.

00:01:03.830 --> 00:01:05.065 align:middle line:90%
>> Josh Del Sol: Thank you.

00:01:05.065 --> 00:01:06.432 align:middle line:84%
>> Regina: So before we
even get into it any further

00:01:06.432 --> 00:01:08.401 align:middle line:84%
and start chit-chatting
between ourselves,

00:01:08.401 --> 00:01:11.605 align:middle line:84%
why don't we take a look at
a clip that sets the stage.

00:01:11.605 --> 00:01:13.706 align:middle line:84%
It's another journalist,
Blake Leavitt.

00:01:13.706 --> 00:01:17.310 align:middle line:84%
She talks about what
the grid is about.

00:01:17.310 --> 00:01:18.777 align:middle line:90%
So do you mind that?

00:01:18.777 --> 00:01:19.613 align:middle line:90%
>> Josh: Absolutely not.

00:01:19.613 --> 00:01:20.413 align:middle line:90%
>> Regina: Let's take a look.

00:01:20.413 --> 00:01:22.081 align:middle line:90%
>> Josh: Let's take a look.

00:01:24.017 --> 00:01:26.920 align:middle line:84%
>> Blake Leavitt: Smart
Grid is a wireless system

00:01:26.920 --> 00:01:30.824 align:middle line:84%
that will fundamentally
turn every single appliance

00:01:30.824 --> 00:01:35.362 align:middle line:84%
in your home into the equivalent
of a transmitting cell phone --

00:01:35.362 --> 00:01:38.665 align:middle line:84%
that's every computer, every
television, every furnace,

00:01:38.665 --> 00:01:41.700 align:middle line:84%
every air conditioner, every
coffee machine, every printer --

00:01:41.700 --> 00:01:43.670 align:middle line:84%
every single appliance
that you have

00:01:43.670 --> 00:01:45.939 align:middle line:90%
in your house will eventually

00:01:45.939 --> 00:01:48.875 align:middle line:84%
in a Smart Grid have an
antenna that's embedded into it

00:01:48.875 --> 00:01:52.779 align:middle line:84%
that will transmit your
usage data to a Smart meter

00:01:52.779 --> 00:01:54.246 align:middle line:90%
on the outside of your home

00:01:54.246 --> 00:01:56.783 align:middle line:84%
that will then transmit
your usage data

00:01:56.783 --> 00:02:01.421 align:middle line:84%
to another tower receiving a
usage signal that will then go

00:02:01.421 --> 00:02:04.391 align:middle line:84%
to the utility company for
supposedly billing purposes.

00:02:04.391 --> 00:02:08.762 align:middle line:84%
Not all signals will just be
about your individual use.

00:02:08.762 --> 00:02:12.065 align:middle line:84%
There will be aggregate meters
that will bounce signals

00:02:12.065 --> 00:02:14.734 align:middle line:84%
from house to house to
house within a neighborhood

00:02:14.734 --> 00:02:17.804 align:middle line:84%
that will then accumulate
all of the usage data

00:02:17.804 --> 00:02:19.972 align:middle line:84%
that will transmit that
to the utility company.

00:02:19.972 --> 00:02:23.310 align:middle line:84%
Now, what that will do is
that the end metering system

00:02:23.310 --> 00:02:27.013 align:middle line:84%
that is transmitting all of that
data will be firing an RF signal

00:02:27.013 --> 00:02:29.382 align:middle line:90%
at many, many times a second,

00:02:29.382 --> 00:02:33.186 align:middle line:84%
which will increase the average
homeowner's radio frequency

00:02:33.186 --> 00:02:35.588 align:middle line:84%
radiation exposure
exponentially.

00:02:35.588 --> 00:02:38.925 align:middle line:84%
>> Regina: There's
so much about this --

00:02:38.925 --> 00:02:41.661 align:middle line:84%
the way they're positioning
it is oh, no, it helps us just

00:02:41.661 --> 00:02:44.831 align:middle line:84%
to be able to access and
read your energy usage easily

00:02:44.831 --> 00:02:47.534 align:middle line:84%
and it helps cut
costs and so forth.

00:02:47.534 --> 00:02:50.437 align:middle line:84%
Really, almost everything
involved with this is a pack

00:02:50.437 --> 00:02:53.540 align:middle line:84%
of lies, and you've revealed
all the lies on so many levels.

00:02:53.540 --> 00:02:56.309 align:middle line:84%
So first let's start
with the invasiveness

00:02:56.309 --> 00:02:58.345 align:middle line:90%
of the installation process,

00:02:58.345 --> 00:03:01.314 align:middle line:84%
because it really violates
our rights from day one.

00:03:01.314 --> 00:03:02.682 align:middle line:90%
>> Josh: It does.

00:03:02.682 --> 00:03:05.151 align:middle line:84%
We're not notified what these
meters are capable of doing,

00:03:05.151 --> 00:03:08.388 align:middle line:84%
we're not notified the
surveillance capabilities.

00:03:08.388 --> 00:03:11.057 align:middle line:84%
We're not notified
that even utilities

00:03:11.057 --> 00:03:13.960 align:middle line:84%
such as the California
Public Utilities Commission,

00:03:13.960 --> 00:03:17.097 align:middle line:84%
or Utilities Commissions,
have admitted that they want

00:03:17.097 --> 00:03:20.166 align:middle line:84%
to sell your data for a
profit, your usage data.

00:03:20.166 --> 00:03:23.335 align:middle line:84%
We're not notified of the
health effects, the fire risks,

00:03:23.335 --> 00:03:26.506 align:middle line:84%
the hacking vulnerabilities
and the cost increases.

00:03:26.506 --> 00:03:28.842 align:middle line:84%
So they're doing all
this by tacit acceptance,

00:03:28.842 --> 00:03:31.277 align:middle line:84%
which means if you didn't
say no, you just said yes.

00:03:31.277 --> 00:03:32.379 align:middle line:84%
>> Regina: And you
don't know to say know

00:03:32.379 --> 00:03:34.180 align:middle line:84%
because you have no idea
what's at risk here,

00:03:34.180 --> 00:03:36.983 align:middle line:84%
and they're selling that data
even to governmental agencies.

00:03:36.983 --> 00:03:38.718 align:middle line:90%
>> Josh: They are, in fact.

00:03:38.718 --> 00:03:41.054 align:middle line:90%
In June or July of this year

00:03:41.054 --> 00:03:43.923 align:middle line:84%
in the San Francisco Chronicle
it was reported that thousands

00:03:43.923 --> 00:03:49.061 align:middle line:84%
of individual energy
records were transferred

00:03:49.061 --> 00:03:52.866 align:middle line:84%
to federal agencies, so this
is just the start of the tip

00:03:52.866 --> 00:03:55.735 align:middle line:84%
of the iceberg of what's
going to be happening,

00:03:55.735 --> 00:03:58.405 align:middle line:84%
unless people really
say no to this agenda.

00:03:58.405 --> 00:04:00.140 align:middle line:84%
>> Regina: And as you said,
it's the tip of the iceberg

00:04:00.140 --> 00:04:02.842 align:middle line:84%
because we're going to
get into so many issues.

00:04:02.842 --> 00:04:04.678 align:middle line:84%
We have only one
hour to cover it all.

00:04:04.678 --> 00:04:07.414 align:middle line:84%
We're going to show another half
a dozen clips from your film.

00:04:07.414 --> 00:04:10.683 align:middle line:84%
So why don't we start with the
installation process and how

00:04:10.683 --> 00:04:13.686 align:middle line:84%
that goes, and the
violations from that point?

00:04:13.686 --> 00:04:18.324 align:middle line:84%
>> Josh: Well, typically
a utility will possibly

00:04:18.324 --> 00:04:21.628 align:middle line:84%
but not mandatorily send you
a notice in the mail to say,

00:04:21.628 --> 00:04:23.229 align:middle line:90%
we're upgrading your meter.

00:04:23.229 --> 00:04:26.933 align:middle line:84%
They don't give you an option to
opt out of it, they don't speak

00:04:26.933 --> 00:04:31.204 align:middle line:84%
of the rights that you have
not to be smart metered,

00:04:31.204 --> 00:04:32.272 align:middle line:90%
so to speak, the rights you have

00:04:32.272 --> 00:04:34.541 align:middle line:84%
to keep your existing
analog meter.

00:04:34.541 --> 00:04:38.445 align:middle line:84%
This is something that people
had to find out on their own,

00:04:38.445 --> 00:04:42.315 align:middle line:84%
and they've found out in droves
this is becoming a very big

00:04:42.315 --> 00:04:45.452 align:middle line:84%
issue in various regions,
in the United States,

00:04:45.452 --> 00:04:47.153 align:middle line:90%
Canada and around the world.

00:04:47.153 --> 00:04:48.521 align:middle line:90%
But basically they're doing this

00:04:48.521 --> 00:04:51.291 align:middle line:84%
against not only individual
consent but they're doing this

00:04:51.291 --> 00:04:54.627 align:middle line:84%
against the consent or the
will of local governments.

00:04:54.627 --> 00:04:57.797 align:middle line:84%
Hundreds of local governments
have issued a moratorium

00:04:57.797 --> 00:05:00.100 align:middle line:84%
against the installation
of these meters

00:05:00.100 --> 00:05:01.101 align:middle line:90%
for the reasons that we listed.

00:05:01.101 --> 00:05:01.935 align:middle line:84%
>> Regina: And they
go in anyway.

00:05:01.935 --> 00:05:03.136 align:middle line:90%
>> Josh: They're go in anyway.

00:05:03.136 --> 00:05:04.304 align:middle line:84%
>> Regina: They're acting
totally autonomously.

00:05:04.304 --> 00:05:05.138 align:middle line:90%
>> Josh: That's right.

00:05:05.138 --> 00:05:08.274 align:middle line:90%
>> Regina: And the thing that --

00:05:08.274 --> 00:05:11.811 align:middle line:84%
you have some video
on here of the ways

00:05:11.811 --> 00:05:13.480 align:middle line:84%
in which you access
the property.

00:05:13.480 --> 00:05:15.314 align:middle line:90%
I mean, it's downright criminal.

00:05:15.314 --> 00:05:18.351 align:middle line:84%
They might as well be
burglars in the night coming in

00:05:18.351 --> 00:05:23.189 align:middle line:84%
and cutting your locks
and chains on your gate,

00:05:23.189 --> 00:05:27.127 align:middle line:84%
your garden gate, for
example, trespassing,

00:05:27.127 --> 00:05:28.628 align:middle line:84%
not notifying you
that you're coming.

00:05:28.628 --> 00:05:30.530 align:middle line:90%
That's what they did to us.

00:05:30.530 --> 00:05:32.265 align:middle line:84%
>> Josh: And in some cases,
they're actually breaking

00:05:32.265 --> 00:05:34.701 align:middle line:84%
down people's doors and we had
a clip of that in the film,

00:05:34.701 --> 00:05:39.539 align:middle line:84%
where someone was new that the
meter replacement person was

00:05:39.539 --> 00:05:44.310 align:middle line:84%
coming and they actually filmed
it and sent us the footage.

00:05:44.310 --> 00:05:45.879 align:middle line:84%
>> Regina: And that
they had the audacity

00:05:45.879 --> 00:05:47.280 align:middle line:90%
to go ahead and do it anyway.

00:05:47.280 --> 00:05:48.781 align:middle line:84%
It's like the fellows
that are ordered

00:05:48.781 --> 00:05:52.218 align:middle line:84%
with putting these meters
in, they're just following --

00:05:52.218 --> 00:05:53.353 align:middle line:84%
and first of all,
we have to remember,

00:05:53.353 --> 00:05:55.255 align:middle line:90%
they are just following orders,

00:05:55.255 --> 00:05:56.623 align:middle line:84%
but they're not really
too concerned

00:05:56.623 --> 00:05:57.624 align:middle line:90%
about what the homeowner

00:05:57.624 --> 00:06:00.994 align:middle line:84%
or anybody witnessing
it is recording,

00:06:00.994 --> 00:06:02.061 align:middle line:90%
for example, in that case.

00:06:02.061 --> 00:06:02.996 align:middle line:90%
They're doing it anyway.

00:06:02.996 --> 00:06:04.631 align:middle line:90%
That's their order.

00:06:04.631 --> 00:06:08.268 align:middle line:84%
And so they trespass on your
property, which is a violation

00:06:08.268 --> 00:06:11.838 align:middle line:84%
in itself, and so they have
these things installed.

00:06:11.838 --> 00:06:14.941 align:middle line:84%
So let's talk about what
happens as soon as --

00:06:14.941 --> 00:06:17.177 align:middle line:84%
there are instances
where this itself,

00:06:17.177 --> 00:06:18.611 align:middle line:84%
just having the installation
of this thing

00:06:18.611 --> 00:06:20.112 align:middle line:90%
on your building is a danger.

00:06:20.112 --> 00:06:21.147 align:middle line:84%
Let's talk about
some of the things

00:06:21.147 --> 00:06:23.316 align:middle line:90%
that have happened, like fires.

00:06:23.316 --> 00:06:24.284 align:middle line:90%
>> Josh: Yeah.

00:06:24.284 --> 00:06:26.319 align:middle line:84%
There's been upwards
of 1,000 fires.

00:06:26.319 --> 00:06:31.090 align:middle line:84%
We've heard throughout various
countries, even in New Zealand,

00:06:31.090 --> 00:06:36.362 align:middle line:84%
an isolated small country, more
than 425 fires were reported

00:06:36.362 --> 00:06:39.465 align:middle line:84%
in a 6-month period a
couple of years ago to deal

00:06:39.465 --> 00:06:41.701 align:middle line:84%
with these meter
quote "upgrades"

00:06:41.701 --> 00:06:45.138 align:middle line:84%
and there's been fires all
over the U.S. and Canada,

00:06:45.138 --> 00:06:48.041 align:middle line:84%
and everywhere these meters are
going in, they're not tested,

00:06:48.041 --> 00:06:50.076 align:middle line:84%
in most cases they're
not even UL

00:06:50.076 --> 00:06:52.912 align:middle line:84%
or Underwriters Laboratories
approved.

00:06:52.912 --> 00:06:56.616 align:middle line:90%
So almost always, in fact

00:06:56.616 --> 00:07:00.186 align:middle line:84%
in every other situation
we know of, any device

00:07:00.186 --> 00:07:02.288 align:middle line:84%
or appliance has
to be UL approved.

00:07:02.288 --> 00:07:05.792 align:middle line:84%
These meters, they're not
subject to testing on any level,

00:07:05.792 --> 00:07:08.828 align:middle line:84%
whether it's functional
testing or safety testing

00:07:08.828 --> 00:07:11.664 align:middle line:84%
or health testing, how
it affects our health.

00:07:11.664 --> 00:07:13.933 align:middle line:84%
>> Regina: Well, where is
the liability, the insurance

00:07:13.933 --> 00:07:15.935 align:middle line:84%
on these devices when
it burns your building

00:07:15.935 --> 00:07:17.670 align:middle line:90%
down or scorches it?

00:07:17.670 --> 00:07:18.771 align:middle line:90%
>> Josh: Well, in many cases,

00:07:18.771 --> 00:07:20.907 align:middle line:84%
the insurers don't even
want to cover this.

00:07:20.907 --> 00:07:24.677 align:middle line:84%
In some cases the fires that
the resulting fires are covered,

00:07:24.677 --> 00:07:28.615 align:middle line:84%
but it's never -- typically
it's not really identified,

00:07:28.615 --> 00:07:31.517 align:middle line:84%
the cause of the fire isn't
identified as the Smart Meter,

00:07:31.517 --> 00:07:33.620 align:middle line:84%
even though it happens
in most cases soon

00:07:33.620 --> 00:07:36.222 align:middle line:90%
after the Smart Meter goes in.

00:07:36.222 --> 00:07:38.524 align:middle line:84%
>> Regina: Let's talk about
what happens then to rates.

00:07:38.524 --> 00:07:41.728 align:middle line:84%
I mean, this a big chunk
in the documentary,

00:07:41.728 --> 00:07:43.429 align:middle line:90%
a very interesting chunk.

00:07:43.429 --> 00:07:44.564 align:middle line:90%
We notice the same thing.

00:07:44.564 --> 00:07:47.000 align:middle line:90%
Immediately, your bills go up.

00:07:47.000 --> 00:07:48.134 align:middle line:90%
>> Josh: Yeah.

00:07:48.134 --> 00:07:49.535 align:middle line:84%
>> Regina: So let's talk
about that phenomena,

00:07:49.535 --> 00:07:52.472 align:middle line:84%
some of the people that you know
of that have been through this

00:07:52.472 --> 00:07:54.807 align:middle line:84%
and kind of blown
the whistle on it.

00:07:54.807 --> 00:07:57.810 align:middle line:84%
The percentage that your bill
may go up, it may jump up,

00:07:57.810 --> 00:08:00.847 align:middle line:84%
and then the attitude of the
companies, the power companies.

00:08:00.847 --> 00:08:02.448 align:middle line:84%
>> Josh: That's right,
and utilities are,

00:08:02.448 --> 00:08:04.284 align:middle line:84%
some of them are
actually admitting,

00:08:04.284 --> 00:08:06.352 align:middle line:84%
through their own internal
polls that they're doing,

00:08:06.352 --> 00:08:09.454 align:middle line:84%
such as Toronto Hydro,
that rates are going

00:08:09.454 --> 00:08:11.991 align:middle line:84%
up immediately following
the installation

00:08:11.991 --> 00:08:17.463 align:middle line:84%
of Smart Meters even before the
intended application of time

00:08:17.463 --> 00:08:20.566 align:middle line:84%
of use billing, which means that
you're going to be paying 2 or 3

00:08:20.566 --> 00:08:23.870 align:middle line:84%
or 10, whatever,
arbitrary number,

00:08:23.870 --> 00:08:26.940 align:middle line:84%
charged through the
nose essentially,

00:08:26.940 --> 00:08:30.476 align:middle line:84%
if you use energy
during peak periods.

00:08:30.476 --> 00:08:32.412 align:middle line:84%
>> Regina: And we're
looking at what kind

00:08:32.412 --> 00:08:34.047 align:middle line:90%
of rate hikes, for example?

00:08:34.047 --> 00:08:35.782 align:middle line:84%
What were some people
experiencing?

00:08:35.782 --> 00:08:38.117 align:middle line:84%
>> Josh: Well, people have
experienced double or triple

00:08:38.117 --> 00:08:41.587 align:middle line:84%
and in rare cases even
7 to 10 times higher.

00:08:41.587 --> 00:08:47.093 align:middle line:84%
We have clips in the film of
news reporters that went out

00:08:47.093 --> 00:08:48.895 align:middle line:84%
and talked to people
after they got the meter

00:08:48.895 --> 00:08:51.497 align:middle line:84%
and their rates were
phenomenally higher.

00:08:51.497 --> 00:08:53.566 align:middle line:84%
But even if they're
not in those situations

00:08:53.566 --> 00:08:57.770 align:middle line:84%
on average the rates are
increasing by 10 to 50%,

00:08:57.770 --> 00:09:00.239 align:middle line:84%
just for having a
meter on your house.

00:09:00.239 --> 00:09:02.575 align:middle line:84%
So we feel, the research
is indicating

00:09:02.575 --> 00:09:04.577 align:middle line:90%
that there's a systemic problem

00:09:04.577 --> 00:09:07.146 align:middle line:84%
with the accuracy
of these devices.

00:09:07.146 --> 00:09:10.950 align:middle line:84%
>> Regina: And the position
of the power companies is, oh,

00:09:10.950 --> 00:09:14.420 align:middle line:84%
those old analog meters
were simply inaccurate.

00:09:14.420 --> 00:09:15.488 align:middle line:90%
They weren't up to speed.

00:09:15.488 --> 00:09:17.223 align:middle line:84%
You're just now getting
a true reflection

00:09:17.223 --> 00:09:19.459 align:middle line:84%
of your usage, and
it's always up.

00:09:19.459 --> 00:09:20.760 align:middle line:90%
>> Josh: Right.

00:09:20.760 --> 00:09:23.396 align:middle line:84%
That's what PG&E actually
tried to take that position

00:09:23.396 --> 00:09:26.332 align:middle line:84%
and then they actually had to
apologize, because they had

00:09:26.332 --> 00:09:30.036 align:middle line:84%
to admit that that is a
completely bogus position.

00:09:30.036 --> 00:09:31.771 align:middle line:84%
But they're lying in all
of these other areas,

00:09:31.771 --> 00:09:34.807 align:middle line:84%
which of course, in
Take Back Your Power,

00:09:34.807 --> 00:09:37.176 align:middle line:84%
we're putting our
finger squarely on.

00:09:37.176 --> 00:09:38.845 align:middle line:84%
>> Regina: There was
a fellow in Australia

00:09:38.845 --> 00:09:40.079 align:middle line:90%
that you feature in the film.

00:09:40.079 --> 00:09:42.115 align:middle line:84%
Can you talk about him a
little bit and what happened

00:09:42.115 --> 00:09:44.117 align:middle line:84%
when he tried to
speak about this?

00:09:44.117 --> 00:09:47.253 align:middle line:84%
>> Josh: Well, he became aware
of a systemic billing issue

00:09:47.253 --> 00:09:50.523 align:middle line:84%
across the board with all Smart
Meters that they were charging

00:09:50.523 --> 00:09:54.327 align:middle line:84%
for energy that the homeowner
was not using, and so he brought

00:09:54.327 --> 00:09:57.196 align:middle line:84%
that information to the utility,
thinking that they're going

00:09:57.196 --> 00:10:00.666 align:middle line:84%
to want to know this, because
there's a liability there.

00:10:00.666 --> 00:10:03.636 align:middle line:90%
There's fraud, and you name it.

00:10:03.636 --> 00:10:05.471 align:middle line:90%
It's illegal, you can't do that.

00:10:05.471 --> 00:10:08.574 align:middle line:84%
So instead of addressing
the issue they just offered

00:10:08.574 --> 00:10:09.842 align:middle line:90%
to pay him off.

00:10:09.842 --> 00:10:11.644 align:middle line:90%
>> Regina: And it didn't work.

00:10:11.644 --> 00:10:12.712 align:middle line:90%
>> Josh: No...

00:10:12.712 --> 00:10:13.713 align:middle line:84%
>> Regina: he's still
out there talking.

00:10:13.713 --> 00:10:14.414 align:middle line:90%
>> Josh: He actually got the--

00:10:14.414 --> 00:10:15.114 align:middle line:90%
>> Regina: Thank God.

00:10:15.114 --> 00:10:16.215 align:middle line:90%
>> Josh: -- the story

00:10:16.215 --> 00:10:18.084 align:middle line:84%
out in quite a big way,
and they're still--

00:10:18.084 --> 00:10:19.385 align:middle line:84%
>> Regina: It was on
mainstream television.

00:10:19.385 --> 00:10:20.186 align:middle line:90%
>> Josh: It was.

00:10:20.186 --> 00:10:21.320 align:middle line:90%
>> Regina: Yeah.

00:10:21.320 --> 00:10:22.388 align:middle line:90%
>> Josh: Yeah.

00:10:22.388 --> 00:10:24.457 align:middle line:84%
>> Regina: You know
Dave Setser, right?

00:10:24.457 --> 00:10:25.591 align:middle line:90%
>> Josh: Not personally but I--

00:10:25.591 --> 00:10:26.492 align:middle line:90%
>> Regina: But you know of him?

00:10:26.492 --> 00:10:27.827 align:middle line:90%
>> Josh: His work is excellence.

00:10:27.827 --> 00:10:31.197 align:middle line:84%
>> Regina: So years ago, I
interviewed Dave, and this was

00:10:31.197 --> 00:10:35.101 align:middle line:84%
when the big push for the
CFL bulbs was going on.

00:10:35.101 --> 00:10:40.940 align:middle line:84%
And he told me something that
I was surprised to hear --

00:10:40.940 --> 00:10:43.676 align:middle line:84%
not really when you consider
who we're talking about here --

00:10:43.676 --> 00:10:45.278 align:middle line:90%
but this is what he said.

00:10:45.278 --> 00:10:49.482 align:middle line:84%
In that instance, what happens
is this is just another bit

00:10:49.482 --> 00:10:55.054 align:middle line:84%
of trickery when it comes
to rates, the greed factor

00:10:55.054 --> 00:10:57.390 align:middle line:84%
with the utility
companies and sneaky ways

00:10:57.390 --> 00:10:59.025 align:middle line:90%
in which to get rate hikes.

00:10:59.025 --> 00:11:03.329 align:middle line:84%
And so he said he had done the
analysis on the actual draw

00:11:03.329 --> 00:11:07.400 align:middle line:84%
of energy from the CFLs,
and then what was happening

00:11:07.400 --> 00:11:13.339 align:middle line:84%
to the bill, to the
apparent usage, wattage.

00:11:13.339 --> 00:11:18.945 align:middle line:84%
And he said there's something
about those particular bulbs.

00:11:18.945 --> 00:11:22.682 align:middle line:84%
The frequency rides the system
in a slightly different way,

00:11:22.682 --> 00:11:26.619 align:middle line:84%
so it sends information
indicating you've used X amount

00:11:26.619 --> 00:11:30.656 align:middle line:84%
of energy when you actually
haven't, and therefore,

00:11:30.656 --> 00:11:34.260 align:middle line:84%
that bit in between when you
have an entire world switching

00:11:34.260 --> 00:11:36.963 align:middle line:84%
over to these bulbs,
is your rate increase,

00:11:36.963 --> 00:11:39.499 align:middle line:84%
and it's a significant
rate increase.

00:11:39.499 --> 00:11:40.566 align:middle line:90%
And of course, we know now

00:11:40.566 --> 00:11:42.702 align:middle line:84%
that those bulbs are
making people sick.

00:11:42.702 --> 00:11:43.936 align:middle line:90%
>> Josh: Yes.

00:11:43.936 --> 00:11:45.204 align:middle line:84%
And the same thing is
happening with Smart Meters.

00:11:45.204 --> 00:11:46.205 align:middle line:90%
>> Regina: Yes.

00:11:46.205 --> 00:11:47.907 align:middle line:84%
>> Josh: The people's
bills are going

00:11:47.907 --> 00:11:49.675 align:middle line:90%
up because their energy usage,

00:11:49.675 --> 00:11:51.777 align:middle line:84%
apparent energy usage
is going up,

00:11:51.777 --> 00:11:55.148 align:middle line:84%
even though their actual
usage is staying the same

00:11:55.148 --> 00:11:56.282 align:middle line:90%
or in some cases even lower.

00:11:56.282 --> 00:11:57.984 align:middle line:84%
>> Regina: Well, once
you get that first bill

00:11:57.984 --> 00:12:00.620 align:middle line:84%
and you're horrified, then your
energy usage of course is going

00:12:00.620 --> 00:12:03.256 align:middle line:84%
to go down because you're
trying to save money,

00:12:03.256 --> 00:12:06.225 align:middle line:90%
and yet we did the same thing.

00:12:06.225 --> 00:12:08.461 align:middle line:84%
When they put a Smart Meter
on the outside of our house,

00:12:08.461 --> 00:12:10.796 align:middle line:84%
we had it for only a couple of
weeks before we got rid of it,

00:12:10.796 --> 00:12:12.932 align:middle line:84%
which we're going to
talk about later on.

00:12:12.932 --> 00:12:16.302 align:middle line:84%
We know some of the same
people in this movement by now.

00:12:16.302 --> 00:12:20.172 align:middle line:84%
But nonetheless, yeah, there
was an immediate spike.

00:12:20.172 --> 00:12:23.342 align:middle line:84%
We tried to start using less and
there was still the high rate

00:12:23.342 --> 00:12:25.144 align:middle line:90%
that was being charged us.

00:12:25.144 --> 00:12:28.014 align:middle line:84%
>> Josh: Yeah, and the mechanism
that we feel, that it appears

00:12:28.014 --> 00:12:31.317 align:middle line:90%
to be causing that mistake,

00:12:31.317 --> 00:12:33.819 align:middle line:84%
is what's called the
switching mode power supply.

00:12:33.819 --> 00:12:35.221 align:middle line:84%
>> Regina: Yeah, talk
about that a little bit?

00:12:35.221 --> 00:12:36.622 align:middle line:90%
>> Josh: Well, the old meters,

00:12:36.622 --> 00:12:39.659 align:middle line:84%
your electromechanical analog
meters, which have been trusted

00:12:39.659 --> 00:12:43.863 align:middle line:84%
and accurate and they
last up to 50 years,

00:12:43.863 --> 00:12:46.832 align:middle line:84%
whereas these ones last 5
or 7 years, even according

00:12:46.832 --> 00:12:51.137 align:middle line:84%
to the utilities, they never had
a switching mode power supply.

00:12:51.137 --> 00:12:54.674 align:middle line:84%
It was just AC current and
it stayed AC until it went

00:12:54.674 --> 00:13:01.047 align:middle line:84%
to the actual appliances,
which had the power converter.

00:13:01.047 --> 00:13:02.415 align:middle line:90%
>> Regina: Right, to DC yeah.

00:13:02.415 --> 00:13:04.383 align:middle line:84%
>> Josh: And so these new meters
have a switching mode power

00:13:04.383 --> 00:13:10.189 align:middle line:84%
supply, which not only seems
to create an inaccuracy

00:13:10.189 --> 00:13:13.192 align:middle line:84%
of the amount of energy being
used, but it creates a situation

00:13:13.192 --> 00:13:17.630 align:middle line:84%
in which all of the wiring in
your house, especially depending

00:13:17.630 --> 00:13:20.533 align:middle line:84%
on how well your
home is grounded,

00:13:20.533 --> 00:13:24.870 align:middle line:84%
especially if the home has
any kind of electrical issue

00:13:24.870 --> 00:13:26.572 align:middle line:90%
at all, which many homes do.

00:13:26.572 --> 00:13:27.707 align:middle line:84%
>> Regina: Right,
especially older homes.

00:13:27.707 --> 00:13:28.741 align:middle line:90%
>> Josh: Exactly.

00:13:28.741 --> 00:13:33.946 align:middle line:84%
The wiring becomes
basically a carrier

00:13:33.946 --> 00:13:35.715 align:middle line:84%
for these high frequency
transients.

00:13:35.715 --> 00:13:38.517 align:middle line:84%
>> Regina: I think that's
also what Dave was alluding

00:13:38.517 --> 00:13:39.318 align:middle line:90%
to as well, yeah.

00:13:39.318 --> 00:13:40.152 align:middle line:90%
>> Josh: Dirty electricity.

00:13:40.152 --> 00:13:40.920 align:middle line:90%
>> Regina: Yeah.

00:13:40.920 --> 00:13:42.288 align:middle line:90%
>> Josh: And so that's --

00:13:42.288 --> 00:13:43.723 align:middle line:84%
in addition to the wireless
component, which we'll get into,

00:13:43.723 --> 00:13:47.026 align:middle line:84%
that dirty electricity component
is making people sick and it's

00:13:47.026 --> 00:13:50.329 align:middle line:84%
at levels which are 20 and
30 times higher than some

00:13:50.329 --> 00:13:51.530 align:middle line:84%
of the levels that
are recognized

00:13:51.530 --> 00:13:53.399 align:middle line:90%
to be the maximum thresholds.

00:13:53.399 --> 00:13:55.701 align:middle line:84%
>> Regina: We're going to get
into that a little bit later,

00:13:55.701 --> 00:13:57.903 align:middle line:84%
the health effects, and
do a whole chunk on that,

00:13:57.903 --> 00:14:01.507 align:middle line:84%
but before that there's
another area, and this woman,

00:14:01.507 --> 00:14:05.978 align:middle line:84%
Blake talked about it in that
last clip we saw, having to do

00:14:05.978 --> 00:14:08.147 align:middle line:90%
with surveillance, in-home --

00:14:08.147 --> 00:14:11.283 align:middle line:84%
essentially it is
in-home surveillance.

00:14:11.283 --> 00:14:15.588 align:middle line:84%
And people who are not ordered
toward conspiracy theories will

00:14:15.588 --> 00:14:17.123 align:middle line:84%
say, well, that's
a little harsh,

00:14:17.123 --> 00:14:20.726 align:middle line:84%
but I'd like to take a look at
this next clip with Ian Crane,

00:14:20.726 --> 00:14:25.931 align:middle line:84%
and he talks about what's
possible, from the other side,

00:14:25.931 --> 00:14:28.968 align:middle line:84%
from a surveillance
point of view,

00:14:28.968 --> 00:14:32.304 align:middle line:84%
and government surveillance
in particular,

00:14:32.304 --> 00:14:35.574 align:middle line:84%
data that can be sold
also to private interests,

00:14:35.574 --> 00:14:37.443 align:middle line:84%
to market back to us
which is interesting.

00:14:37.443 --> 00:14:39.311 align:middle line:84%
So let's take a look at
what Ian Crane has to say

00:14:39.311 --> 00:14:40.746 align:middle line:90%
about the surveillance.

00:14:40.746 --> 00:14:45.051 align:middle line:84%
>> Ian Crane: Part of
the Smart Meter agenda is

00:14:45.051 --> 00:14:51.857 align:middle line:84%
to literally track every
single movement within a house,

00:14:51.857 --> 00:14:54.627 align:middle line:84%
so every time somebody
switches on a light,

00:14:54.627 --> 00:14:57.963 align:middle line:84%
every time somebody
switches on an appliance,

00:14:57.963 --> 00:15:00.966 align:middle line:84%
each of these appliance
has a unique code

00:15:00.966 --> 00:15:03.335 align:middle line:84%
which is then effectively
transmitted

00:15:03.335 --> 00:15:07.273 align:middle line:84%
through the Smart Meter down the
grid, so anybody that is minded

00:15:07.273 --> 00:15:10.643 align:middle line:84%
to do so can hone in on
an individual residence

00:15:10.643 --> 00:15:13.846 align:middle line:84%
and actually track what is
going on in that household.

00:15:13.846 --> 00:15:15.948 align:middle line:84%
>> So they can figure out, when
is your refrigerator being used,

00:15:15.948 --> 00:15:19.185 align:middle line:84%
when is your TV on, what are
you doing with your energy,

00:15:19.185 --> 00:15:21.487 align:middle line:84%
and they're going to
start having a profile

00:15:21.487 --> 00:15:23.322 align:middle line:90%
of you as an individual.

00:15:23.322 --> 00:15:26.358 align:middle line:84%
>> A congressional research
report all but concluded

00:15:26.358 --> 00:15:28.961 align:middle line:84%
that Smart Meters in the
United States are a violation

00:15:28.961 --> 00:15:32.098 align:middle line:90%
of the Fourth Amendment.

00:15:32.098 --> 00:15:34.200 align:middle line:84%
In no uncertain terms,
the court has asserted

00:15:34.200 --> 00:15:35.601 align:middle line:90%
that at the very core

00:15:35.601 --> 00:15:38.404 align:middle line:84%
of the Fourth Amendment stands
the right of a man to retreat

00:15:38.404 --> 00:15:40.239 align:middle line:84%
into his home and
there would be free

00:15:40.239 --> 00:15:42.074 align:middle line:84%
from unreasonable
governmental intrusion.

00:15:42.074 --> 00:15:47.413 align:middle line:84%
With Smart Meters, police
will have access to data

00:15:47.413 --> 00:15:49.882 align:middle line:84%
that might be used to track
resident's daily lives

00:15:49.882 --> 00:15:53.519 align:middle line:84%
and routines while in their
homes, including their eating,

00:15:53.519 --> 00:15:56.522 align:middle line:84%
sleeping and showering habits,
what appliances they use

00:15:56.522 --> 00:15:59.191 align:middle line:84%
and when, and whether
they prefer the television

00:15:59.191 --> 00:16:01.694 align:middle line:84%
to the treadmill, among
a host of other details.

00:16:01.694 --> 00:16:05.898 align:middle line:84%
>> Ian: For example,
who's in the house,

00:16:05.898 --> 00:16:10.836 align:middle line:84%
how often do you leave
the house late for work,

00:16:10.836 --> 00:16:14.907 align:middle line:84%
how often do you eat microwave
dinners compared to cooking

00:16:14.907 --> 00:16:17.943 align:middle line:84%
in the oven, how many times
a week do you do the washing,

00:16:17.943 --> 00:16:20.045 align:middle line:90%
how many times do you watch TV,

00:16:20.045 --> 00:16:22.948 align:middle line:84%
how long do you spend
watching TV, what do you watch?

00:16:22.948 --> 00:16:26.919 align:middle line:84%
In a custody battle, it could
provide information on whether

00:16:26.919 --> 00:16:29.922 align:middle line:84%
or not you've ever left the kids
home alone and for how long.

00:16:29.922 --> 00:16:35.795 align:middle line:84%
>> Regina: As if Facebook wasn't
providing enough data mining

00:16:35.795 --> 00:16:38.664 align:middle line:84%
opportunity for the
government, now it can be done

00:16:38.664 --> 00:16:40.398 align:middle line:90%
in this much more subtle way.

00:16:40.398 --> 00:16:41.667 align:middle line:90%
>> Josh: Right.

00:16:41.667 --> 00:16:43.369 align:middle line:84%
And what we're seeing is
really the NSA spying scandal.

00:16:43.369 --> 00:16:44.503 align:middle line:90%
>> Regina: Yes.

00:16:44.503 --> 00:16:45.838 align:middle line:84%
>> Josh: The phones and
Internet surveillance.

00:16:45.838 --> 00:16:48.941 align:middle line:84%
It's really the tip of the
iceberg, so as we saw alluded

00:16:48.941 --> 00:16:53.045 align:middle line:84%
to in that clip and it actually
gets more in depth after then

00:16:53.045 --> 00:16:58.617 align:middle line:84%
in the film, this is going
to give the potential

00:16:58.617 --> 00:17:02.655 align:middle line:84%
for interested parties,
be it the utilities

00:17:02.655 --> 00:17:06.192 align:middle line:84%
or marketing companies
or government, to monitor

00:17:06.192 --> 00:17:09.895 align:middle line:84%
and control everything
going on in your home.

00:17:09.895 --> 00:17:11.797 align:middle line:90%
So every decision you make,

00:17:11.797 --> 00:17:14.500 align:middle line:84%
every product, every
conversation...

00:17:14.500 --> 00:17:16.168 align:middle line:84%
>> Regina: You already
have an electronic trail,

00:17:16.168 --> 00:17:18.604 align:middle line:84%
just through your
purchasing power alone.

00:17:18.604 --> 00:17:19.572 align:middle line:90%
>> Josh: Right.

00:17:19.572 --> 00:17:21.640 align:middle line:84%
So this Smart Meter
is the device

00:17:21.640 --> 00:17:25.211 align:middle line:84%
that makes it all
possible, or not,

00:17:25.211 --> 00:17:29.515 align:middle line:84%
depending on whether we refuse
to have them in our homes

00:17:29.515 --> 00:17:32.184 align:middle line:84%
or not, so of course, as
you know, we have the right

00:17:32.184 --> 00:17:35.387 align:middle line:84%
to refuse this on
any basis whatsoever.

00:17:35.387 --> 00:17:38.324 align:middle line:84%
>> Regina: General Petraeus,
there was a comment in your film

00:17:38.324 --> 00:17:41.060 align:middle line:84%
by General Petraeus, which I
thought was very interesting.

00:17:41.060 --> 00:17:44.230 align:middle line:90%
It said, "We can spy on you

00:17:44.230 --> 00:17:46.265 align:middle line:84%
through your household
appliances,

00:17:46.265 --> 00:17:50.502 align:middle line:84%
and if we have the ability to do
that, we will probably use it."

00:17:50.502 --> 00:17:52.371 align:middle line:90%
There it is.

00:17:52.371 --> 00:17:55.040 align:middle line:90%
It's not a secret agenda.

00:17:55.040 --> 00:17:58.978 align:middle line:84%
>> Josh: It's kind of like who
was it, Orwell in 1924 talked

00:17:58.978 --> 00:18:00.546 align:middle line:90%
about the open conspiracy.

00:18:00.546 --> 00:18:01.881 align:middle line:90%
>> Regina: Yes.

00:18:01.881 --> 00:18:04.416 align:middle line:84%
>> Josh: I believe that I
might not have the date right,

00:18:04.416 --> 00:18:06.519 align:middle line:84%
but this idea of
the open conspiracy,

00:18:06.519 --> 00:18:10.623 align:middle line:84%
where they're actually using
the tacit acceptance law,

00:18:10.623 --> 00:18:14.260 align:middle line:84%
which I believe is directly
related to the law of free will

00:18:14.260 --> 00:18:20.165 align:middle line:84%
in our universe, to telegraph
what's going on through media

00:18:20.165 --> 00:18:24.336 align:middle line:84%
or movies or TV, or even
just telling you straight up.

00:18:24.336 --> 00:18:26.105 align:middle line:84%
>> Regina: They call it
predictive programming too,

00:18:26.105 --> 00:18:26.805 align:middle line:90%
I believe.

00:18:26.805 --> 00:18:27.306 align:middle line:90%
>> Josh: Yes, exactly.

00:18:27.306 --> 00:18:27.873 align:middle line:90%
Yes, good.

00:18:27.873 --> 00:18:29.008 align:middle line:90%
>> Regina: Yes.

00:18:29.008 --> 00:18:30.509 align:middle line:84%
>> Josh: And so unless
people say no, you know,

00:18:30.509 --> 00:18:35.581 align:middle line:84%
they therefore have the right,
according to their system of law

00:18:35.581 --> 00:18:36.782 align:middle line:90%
to go ahead and do this.

00:18:36.782 --> 00:18:38.417 align:middle line:84%
>> Regina: Just a personal
question before we go

00:18:38.417 --> 00:18:40.252 align:middle line:90%
on to issues.

00:18:40.252 --> 00:18:44.023 align:middle line:84%
You're standing up in such a
profound way on this issue,

00:18:44.023 --> 00:18:47.026 align:middle line:84%
and this isn't what you had
intended to do, personally.

00:18:47.026 --> 00:18:49.528 align:middle line:84%
It's something you
kind of back into,

00:18:49.528 --> 00:18:52.531 align:middle line:84%
and now you're the
poster boy for the subject

00:18:52.531 --> 00:18:55.067 align:middle line:84%
of smart meter grids
and our rights.

00:18:55.067 --> 00:18:56.402 align:middle line:84%
>> Josh: I don't want to
be poster boy, though.

00:18:56.402 --> 00:18:57.870 align:middle line:84%
>> Regina: Yeah, and
unfortunately you've kind

00:18:57.870 --> 00:19:00.406 align:middle line:84%
of become that in a
sense, which is --

00:19:00.406 --> 00:19:02.308 align:middle line:84%
if you're going to
have a poster boy,

00:19:02.308 --> 00:19:05.377 align:middle line:84%
the thing is you're passionate,
you're honest, you're sincere,

00:19:05.377 --> 00:19:07.846 align:middle line:84%
and you're doing this for all
the right reasons, but how does

00:19:07.846 --> 00:19:10.549 align:middle line:84%
that feel inside your own
skin to have suddenly stepped

00:19:10.549 --> 00:19:11.717 align:middle line:90%
into all of this knowledge?

00:19:11.717 --> 00:19:13.452 align:middle line:84%
Because when you
watch a documentary,

00:19:13.452 --> 00:19:17.523 align:middle line:84%
it's your own journey saying,
holy cow, I didn't expect that.

00:19:17.523 --> 00:19:20.092 align:middle line:84%
>> Josh: I started this journey
just over two years ago, Regina,

00:19:20.092 --> 00:19:23.896 align:middle line:84%
and I had no idea -- everything
that we would uncover,

00:19:23.896 --> 00:19:25.230 align:middle line:90%
all the dots that would connect

00:19:25.230 --> 00:19:28.133 align:middle line:84%
and we would make
available in the film.

00:19:28.133 --> 00:19:32.037 align:middle line:84%
I thought it was going to
be a 10-minute YouTube video

00:19:32.037 --> 00:19:34.907 align:middle line:84%
interviewing people
who had health symptoms

00:19:34.907 --> 00:19:38.310 align:middle line:84%
from these meters,
and it just snowballed

00:19:38.310 --> 00:19:40.679 align:middle line:84%
into this full-length
feature film

00:19:40.679 --> 00:19:42.948 align:middle line:84%
which attracted amazing
people in our production

00:19:42.948 --> 00:19:45.851 align:middle line:84%
and just helping us get
this film finished and out,

00:19:45.851 --> 00:19:47.519 align:middle line:90%
really synchronistic process,

00:19:47.519 --> 00:19:51.290 align:middle line:84%
and me and my co-creative
partner, Darryl,

00:19:51.290 --> 00:19:53.826 align:middle line:90%
just had this amazing experience

00:19:53.826 --> 00:19:57.429 align:middle line:84%
of there was this
higher guidance involved

00:19:57.429 --> 00:19:58.797 align:middle line:90%
in the making of this film.

00:19:58.797 --> 00:20:01.033 align:middle line:84%
>> Regina: Like angels were
flapping their wings around you.

00:20:01.033 --> 00:20:03.435 align:middle line:84%
Everything you needed
came to you.

00:20:03.435 --> 00:20:06.238 align:middle line:84%
>> Josh: Just the synchronicity
was amazing, and we both felt

00:20:06.238 --> 00:20:10.943 align:middle line:84%
that and we were both calling
that in as part of hits.

00:20:10.943 --> 00:20:13.946 align:middle line:84%
But this whole process has
necessarily required me

00:20:13.946 --> 00:20:17.483 align:middle line:84%
to take back my own power
and to move through the fear,

00:20:17.483 --> 00:20:21.887 align:middle line:84%
which we all must do through
this initiation of fear

00:20:21.887 --> 00:20:25.958 align:middle line:84%
of our own authority, if you
will, of leading our lives.

00:20:25.958 --> 00:20:29.294 align:middle line:84%
And I definitely had to do
this, part of this process

00:20:29.294 --> 00:20:32.164 align:middle line:84%
and continue to do
so on my own path.

00:20:32.164 --> 00:20:35.334 align:middle line:84%
But that's been a
significant learning curve

00:20:35.334 --> 00:20:37.069 align:middle line:90%
in my life, if you will.

00:20:37.069 --> 00:20:39.471 align:middle line:84%
>> Regina: So this really
was a profound turning point

00:20:39.471 --> 00:20:40.839 align:middle line:90%
in your life, just stepping

00:20:40.839 --> 00:20:44.076 align:middle line:84%
on the path before you knew
what was going to be revealed?

00:20:44.076 --> 00:20:44.643 align:middle line:90%
>> Josh: Yeah.

00:20:44.643 --> 00:20:45.911 align:middle line:90%
>> Regina: Yeah.

00:20:45.911 --> 00:20:48.881 align:middle line:84%
Okay, I want to get back
into a topic that I find kind

00:20:48.881 --> 00:20:51.583 align:middle line:84%
of freaky, because I was reading
about it 3 or 4 years ago,

00:20:51.583 --> 00:20:55.354 align:middle line:84%
and then there were
YouTube videos popping up,

00:20:55.354 --> 00:20:57.222 align:middle line:90%
saying, oh, no such thing.

00:20:57.222 --> 00:21:01.293 align:middle line:84%
And that has to do with
Verizon's smart TV patents.

00:21:01.293 --> 00:21:03.295 align:middle line:90%
Let's talk about that.

00:21:03.295 --> 00:21:07.032 align:middle line:84%
>> Josh: Right so Verizon
actually applied for a patent,

00:21:07.032 --> 00:21:09.001 align:middle line:84%
the U.S. Patent Office,
and the details

00:21:09.001 --> 00:21:12.004 align:middle line:90%
of this are in the film as well.

00:21:12.004 --> 00:21:14.973 align:middle line:84%
The ability -- this is in
their own languaging --

00:21:14.973 --> 00:21:19.511 align:middle line:84%
they patented the ability
for detection, monitoring

00:21:19.511 --> 00:21:22.347 align:middle line:84%
and detection systems
attached to televisions,

00:21:22.347 --> 00:21:27.453 align:middle line:84%
having the ability to tell who's
in the room, what products are

00:21:27.453 --> 00:21:30.622 align:middle line:84%
in the room, what conversations
are happening, what the mood is

00:21:30.622 --> 00:21:32.324 align:middle line:90%
of those conversations,

00:21:32.324 --> 00:21:36.595 align:middle line:84%
and based upon even facial
recognition technology,

00:21:36.595 --> 00:21:38.831 align:middle line:90%
gesture recognition technology.

00:21:38.831 --> 00:21:42.434 align:middle line:84%
So based upon that,
they would then

00:21:42.434 --> 00:21:47.272 align:middle line:84%
in their patented technology,
be able to play to you,

00:21:47.272 --> 00:21:52.911 align:middle line:84%
force push advertising, of
what the system feels you need

00:21:52.911 --> 00:21:56.315 align:middle line:84%
or you would be most likely
to purchase in that moment.

00:21:56.315 --> 00:21:58.584 align:middle line:84%
>> Regina: This is Big
Brother's on steroids.

00:21:58.584 --> 00:22:00.552 align:middle line:84%
>> Josh: And they talk about
it happening in real time.

00:22:00.552 --> 00:22:01.787 align:middle line:90%
>> Regina: Yeah.

00:22:01.787 --> 00:22:03.789 align:middle line:84%
>> Josh: So again, the
smart grid technology is --

00:22:03.789 --> 00:22:07.626 align:middle line:84%
and the smart meters, are
necessary for this kind

00:22:07.626 --> 00:22:13.065 align:middle line:84%
of invasive in-home
Orwellianism to happen at all.

00:22:13.065 --> 00:22:14.566 align:middle line:84%
>> Regina: I don't know
if you can answer this,

00:22:14.566 --> 00:22:16.702 align:middle line:84%
but do they actually think
people will purchase these

00:22:16.702 --> 00:22:19.404 align:middle line:84%
devices, or is this
going to be embedded

00:22:19.404 --> 00:22:21.907 align:middle line:84%
in all future technology
of that nature,

00:22:21.907 --> 00:22:23.709 align:middle line:90%
televisions, for example?

00:22:23.709 --> 00:22:26.979 align:middle line:84%
>> Josh: Well, there's all kinds
of marketing and propaganda

00:22:26.979 --> 00:22:29.181 align:middle line:84%
and we were talking about
this before the show,

00:22:29.181 --> 00:22:31.884 align:middle line:84%
to make something
look attractive by--

00:22:31.884 --> 00:22:34.419 align:middle line:84%
>> Regina: How do you make
being spied on look attractive?

00:22:34.419 --> 00:22:35.120 align:middle line:90%
>> Josh: I don't know.

00:22:35.120 --> 00:22:36.522 align:middle line:90%
My mind doesn't work--

00:22:36.522 --> 00:22:39.191 align:middle line:84%
>> Regina: How could they begin
to spin -- I'm just wondering,

00:22:39.191 --> 00:22:41.860 align:middle line:84%
how would Verizon begin
spinning that one?

00:22:41.860 --> 00:22:44.830 align:middle line:84%
Who in the world would ever buy
one of those devices, right?

00:22:44.830 --> 00:22:46.331 align:middle line:84%
>> Josh: Well, they
would probably bundle it

00:22:46.331 --> 00:22:49.968 align:middle line:84%
with something that is
convenient, so something

00:22:49.968 --> 00:22:53.172 align:middle line:84%
like the iPhone 5, for
example, has new features

00:22:53.172 --> 00:22:55.007 align:middle line:90%
that people want to upgrade to,

00:22:55.007 --> 00:22:59.511 align:middle line:84%
but then it has additional
surveillance capabilities

00:22:59.511 --> 00:23:03.682 align:middle line:84%
with that type of
product and product line.

00:23:03.682 --> 00:23:06.819 align:middle line:84%
Well, it seems to be the way
that corporations are going.

00:23:06.819 --> 00:23:10.455 align:middle line:84%
They're bundling
additional placating benefits

00:23:10.455 --> 00:23:12.691 align:middle line:84%
of technology, which are
really only benefitting us

00:23:12.691 --> 00:23:16.461 align:middle line:84%
on the surface for
very little, if at all,

00:23:16.461 --> 00:23:19.698 align:middle line:84%
and then underneath them
is ways in which our rights

00:23:19.698 --> 00:23:21.833 align:middle line:84%
and our autonomy and our
decision-making are being

00:23:21.833 --> 00:23:24.369 align:middle line:90%
further eroded and violated.

00:23:24.369 --> 00:23:25.337 align:middle line:90%
>> Regina: It's so insidious.

00:23:25.337 --> 00:23:27.105 align:middle line:84%
This subject really
ticks me off,

00:23:27.105 --> 00:23:30.008 align:middle line:84%
and there was someone
else it ticked off.

00:23:30.008 --> 00:23:31.877 align:middle line:84%
You didn't shoot
this particular clip.

00:23:31.877 --> 00:23:34.947 align:middle line:84%
This was with Edward
Snowden, and he is talking

00:23:34.947 --> 00:23:36.782 align:middle line:90%
about what we're giving up here.

00:23:36.782 --> 00:23:38.917 align:middle line:84%
So let's take a look at
the Edward Snowden clip.

00:23:38.917 --> 00:23:43.655 align:middle line:84%
>> Edward Snowden: If you're
not doing anything wrong,

00:23:43.655 --> 00:23:45.090 align:middle line:84%
you're being watched
and recorded

00:23:45.090 --> 00:23:47.593 align:middle line:90%
and the storage capability

00:23:47.593 --> 00:23:52.264 align:middle line:84%
of these systems increases every
year consistently by orders

00:23:52.264 --> 00:23:55.400 align:middle line:84%
of magnitude, to where
it's getting to the point,

00:23:55.400 --> 00:23:58.904 align:middle line:84%
you don't have to have done
anything wrong, you simply have

00:23:58.904 --> 00:24:01.340 align:middle line:84%
to eventually fall under
suspicion from somebody,

00:24:01.340 --> 00:24:05.611 align:middle line:84%
even by a wrong call, and then
they can use the system go back

00:24:05.611 --> 00:24:09.081 align:middle line:84%
in time and scrutinize every
decision you've ever made,

00:24:09.081 --> 00:24:11.850 align:middle line:84%
every friend you've ever
discussed something with,

00:24:11.850 --> 00:24:17.289 align:middle line:84%
and attack you on that basis
to sort of derive suspicion

00:24:17.289 --> 00:24:19.925 align:middle line:84%
from an innocent
life and paint anyone

00:24:19.925 --> 00:24:21.927 align:middle line:90%
in the context of a wrongdoer.

00:24:21.927 --> 00:24:24.930 align:middle line:84%
>> Let's look for
example at the CISPA bill,

00:24:24.930 --> 00:24:30.168 align:middle line:84%
that's the Cyber Intelligence
Sharing and Protection Act,

00:24:30.168 --> 00:24:33.839 align:middle line:84%
which was intended to legalize
transferring all your data

00:24:33.839 --> 00:24:36.642 align:middle line:84%
from mega corporations
to the government.

00:24:36.642 --> 00:24:38.644 align:middle line:84%
Now, this seems to
be in violation

00:24:38.644 --> 00:24:42.281 align:middle line:84%
of our Fourth Amendment rights
against unreasonable search

00:24:42.281 --> 00:24:44.983 align:middle line:84%
and seizure, but it's
already passed the House.

00:24:44.983 --> 00:24:48.887 align:middle line:84%
Fortunately so far the Senate
has refused to vote on it,

00:24:48.887 --> 00:24:51.390 align:middle line:84%
recognizing the pushback
to CISPA.

00:24:51.390 --> 00:24:54.760 align:middle line:84%
Apparently the Obama
administration has created a

00:24:54.760 --> 00:24:57.562 align:middle line:84%
covert agreement with
the Justice Department

00:24:57.562 --> 00:25:00.265 align:middle line:84%
to grant immunity to all
these communication companies

00:25:00.265 --> 00:25:04.403 align:middle line:84%
and Internet companies that
we're already sharing the data.

00:25:04.403 --> 00:25:10.575 align:middle line:84%
And now, as of June 12, 2013,
a new aspect of that goes

00:25:10.575 --> 00:25:14.913 align:middle line:84%
into effect which expands
this whole authorization

00:25:14.913 --> 00:25:18.183 align:middle line:84%
to cover all critical
infrastructure sectors,

00:25:18.183 --> 00:25:23.121 align:middle line:84%
and that includes energy,
health and finance.

00:25:23.121 --> 00:25:25.324 align:middle line:84%
>> Edward Snowden: What you're
seeing is the establishment

00:25:25.324 --> 00:25:27.959 align:middle line:90%
of a surveillance network.

00:25:27.959 --> 00:25:34.266 align:middle line:84%
It raises the specter of kind
of the rise of soft tyranny,

00:25:34.266 --> 00:25:37.703 align:middle line:84%
it raises the specter of
you're automatically suspicious

00:25:37.703 --> 00:25:40.305 align:middle line:90%
until we prove that you're not.

00:25:40.305 --> 00:25:45.110 align:middle line:84%
It raises the specter of I
call it a universal wiretap,

00:25:45.110 --> 00:25:49.681 align:middle line:84%
a persistent universal
wiretap on every single person

00:25:49.681 --> 00:25:52.250 align:middle line:84%
or it's not, they
can create one.

00:25:52.250 --> 00:25:53.985 align:middle line:84%
And what happens if
they don't like you?

00:25:53.985 --> 00:25:56.722 align:middle line:84%
What happens if you speak ill
will against the government?

00:25:56.722 --> 00:25:58.757 align:middle line:84%
What happens if you
say something they

00:25:58.757 --> 00:26:00.292 align:middle line:90%
consider disloyal?

00:26:00.292 --> 00:26:03.028 align:middle line:84%
That's not the country
that I took an oath

00:26:03.028 --> 00:26:05.597 align:middle line:84%
to defend four times in
my government career.

00:26:05.597 --> 00:26:10.335 align:middle line:84%
>> Regina: Let's talk
about Google for a moment.

00:26:10.335 --> 00:26:12.838 align:middle line:84%
That was really a
very shocking thing

00:26:12.838 --> 00:26:15.640 align:middle line:90%
in the film regarding Google.

00:26:15.640 --> 00:26:17.142 align:middle line:90%
Would you tell us about it?

00:26:17.142 --> 00:26:18.243 align:middle line:84%
>> Josh: Yeah, there
was a couple

00:26:18.243 --> 00:26:21.279 align:middle line:90%
of things in an interview.

00:26:21.279 --> 00:26:27.652 align:middle line:84%
The CEO of Google,
Eric Schmidt was asked,

00:26:27.652 --> 00:26:32.391 align:middle line:84%
should we be trusting
Google, and his response was,

00:26:32.391 --> 00:26:34.159 align:middle line:84%
if you have something
that you want to hide,

00:26:34.159 --> 00:26:37.462 align:middle line:84%
maybe you shouldn't be
doing it in the first place.

00:26:37.462 --> 00:26:39.197 align:middle line:90%
So that kind of sets the tone

00:26:39.197 --> 00:26:43.802 align:middle line:84%
for the world's most famous
company, you could say,

00:26:43.802 --> 00:26:45.404 align:middle line:90%
and their ethics around this.

00:26:45.404 --> 00:26:48.273 align:middle line:84%
He goes on to further talk
about the creepy line in trying

00:26:48.273 --> 00:26:51.743 align:middle line:84%
to push up to the creepy line
but not cross it, and then kind

00:26:51.743 --> 00:26:54.646 align:middle line:84%
of under his breath,
and we'll see it --

00:26:54.646 --> 00:26:56.581 align:middle line:84%
>> Regina: Well, it wasn't
really under his breath.

00:26:56.581 --> 00:26:58.183 align:middle line:84%
>> Josh: It was just
this comment that came

00:26:58.183 --> 00:27:03.388 align:middle line:84%
out of left field to say that,
perhaps the question was asked

00:27:03.388 --> 00:27:05.590 align:middle line:84%
of him in a different
interview --

00:27:05.590 --> 00:27:07.292 align:middle line:90%
would it be across the line

00:27:07.292 --> 00:27:10.195 align:middle line:84%
if there was a chip
implanted in my brain?

00:27:10.195 --> 00:27:13.932 align:middle line:84%
And his response was, that
might be across the line,

00:27:13.932 --> 00:27:17.636 align:middle line:84%
but then he said, when
the technology improves,

00:27:17.636 --> 00:27:20.705 align:middle line:84%
it might be kind of fair
game, was the impression.

00:27:20.705 --> 00:27:27.112 align:middle line:84%
So obviously there is no moral
and ethic based foundation

00:27:27.112 --> 00:27:30.182 align:middle line:84%
to their understanding of what
they call the creepy line,

00:27:30.182 --> 00:27:33.718 align:middle line:84%
and this is becoming more
evident all the time.

00:27:33.718 --> 00:27:36.955 align:middle line:84%
>> Regina: And we
have to keep in mind

00:27:36.955 --> 00:27:41.560 align:middle line:84%
that Google has some very
interesting arrangements

00:27:41.560 --> 00:27:45.363 align:middle line:84%
with the government,
intelligence agencies.

00:27:45.363 --> 00:27:47.432 align:middle line:84%
We have to also remember
Facebook,

00:27:47.432 --> 00:27:51.736 align:middle line:84%
putting all people's pictures of
their puppies and their children

00:27:51.736 --> 00:27:53.004 align:middle line:90%
and their grandchildren.

00:27:53.004 --> 00:27:54.673 align:middle line:84%
>> Josh: And the CIA connections
with Facebook, I mean,

00:27:54.673 --> 00:27:55.841 align:middle line:90%
anybody can do research.

00:27:55.841 --> 00:27:56.942 align:middle line:90%
>> Regina: DARPA and CIA,

00:27:56.942 --> 00:27:58.877 align:middle line:84%
that's where the whole
thing stemmed from.

00:27:58.877 --> 00:28:05.083 align:middle line:84%
This is flat out data
mining in the friendliest --

00:28:05.083 --> 00:28:10.121 align:middle line:84%
probably the greatest
user incentive of anything

00:28:10.121 --> 00:28:12.657 align:middle line:84%
to date is Facebook,
and it's one

00:28:12.657 --> 00:28:14.993 align:middle line:84%
of the greatest data
mining operations

00:28:14.993 --> 00:28:16.461 align:middle line:90%
that has ever existed.

00:28:16.461 --> 00:28:19.464 align:middle line:84%
When you're talking about
shaping public policy,

00:28:19.464 --> 00:28:24.569 align:middle line:84%
public perception about going
to war or whatever, all you need

00:28:24.569 --> 00:28:29.140 align:middle line:84%
to do -- and Cliff High,
he does his monthly reports

00:28:29.140 --> 00:28:31.042 align:middle line:84%
on this regularly, and
I'm sure you're aware

00:28:31.042 --> 00:28:31.810 align:middle line:90%
of Cliff High, right.

00:28:31.810 --> 00:28:33.211 align:middle line:90%
>> Josh: Yes, I am.

00:28:33.211 --> 00:28:37.482 align:middle line:84%
>> Regina: And in his case, they
created a database that spiders

00:28:37.482 --> 00:28:42.320 align:middle line:84%
in -- he also did -- that
spiders in to various forms

00:28:42.320 --> 00:28:46.291 align:middle line:84%
and websites and such
around the world.

00:28:46.291 --> 00:28:48.660 align:middle line:84%
So it spiders in in
a number of languages

00:28:48.660 --> 00:28:51.396 align:middle line:84%
to see what people are thinking
about, what they're fearing

00:28:51.396 --> 00:28:53.765 align:middle line:84%
to find future trends,
to warn us

00:28:53.765 --> 00:28:55.300 align:middle line:84%
of what's being reflected
back to us,

00:28:55.300 --> 00:28:58.169 align:middle line:84%
that we're actually
projecting out there ourselves.

00:28:58.169 --> 00:28:58.670 align:middle line:90%
>> Josh: Right.

00:28:58.670 --> 00:28:59.671 align:middle line:90%
Right.

00:28:59.671 --> 00:29:00.772 align:middle line:84%
>> Regina: This is
a very complex...

00:29:00.772 --> 00:29:02.607 align:middle line:84%
>> Josh: And what that
probably most stems

00:29:02.607 --> 00:29:04.109 align:middle line:90%
from is social engineering,

00:29:04.109 --> 00:29:05.210 align:middle line:90%
>> Regina: Yes.

00:29:05.210 --> 00:29:06.611 align:middle line:84%
>> Josh: What we're
being fed in the media,

00:29:06.611 --> 00:29:10.048 align:middle line:84%
in the alternative media, even,
what we're being told we need

00:29:10.048 --> 00:29:12.584 align:middle line:84%
to be concerned about, then
people start talking about it,

00:29:12.584 --> 00:29:16.187 align:middle line:84%
and that happens because as
we know, as we're finding out,

00:29:16.187 --> 00:29:17.522 align:middle line:90%
we're creative beings.

00:29:17.522 --> 00:29:20.191 align:middle line:84%
What we focus on really happens
if we focus on the problem

00:29:20.191 --> 00:29:24.663 align:middle line:84%
without getting to the solution,
it's not a productive thing.

00:29:24.663 --> 00:29:25.764 align:middle line:90%
>> Regina: No.

00:29:25.764 --> 00:29:26.998 align:middle line:84%
>> Josh: So the one
thing that I might add

00:29:26.998 --> 00:29:31.536 align:middle line:84%
to that model is the how
the social engineering gets

00:29:31.536 --> 00:29:32.837 align:middle line:90%
seeded in.

00:29:32.837 --> 00:29:34.806 align:middle line:84%
>> Regina: Absolutely,
and by the way, Cliff,

00:29:34.806 --> 00:29:37.842 align:middle line:84%
for anyone interested, Clif
High site is Web Bots, right.

00:29:37.842 --> 00:29:41.947 align:middle line:84%
And David Eich calls this
problem reaction solution.

00:29:41.947 --> 00:29:44.849 align:middle line:90%
That's exactly what it is.

00:29:44.849 --> 00:29:47.953 align:middle line:84%
By consensus, they know what we
fear, so create that problem,

00:29:47.953 --> 00:29:52.624 align:middle line:84%
then they will come to the
rescue -- we have a reaction,

00:29:52.624 --> 00:29:54.192 align:middle line:84%
they come to the rescue
by way of solution

00:29:54.192 --> 00:29:56.661 align:middle line:84%
and they're always more
Draconian by nature.

00:29:56.661 --> 00:29:58.430 align:middle line:90%
This is where we were talking

00:29:58.430 --> 00:30:01.499 align:middle line:84%
about almost mass
SIOPs going on here.

00:30:01.499 --> 00:30:02.734 align:middle line:90%
>> Josh: Exactly, yeah.

00:30:02.734 --> 00:30:04.869 align:middle line:84%
>> Regina: And we're
volunteering the information.

00:30:04.869 --> 00:30:06.738 align:middle line:84%
>> Josh: Yeah, laws that
are written in advance,

00:30:06.738 --> 00:30:09.140 align:middle line:84%
then there's something that
happens, it's orchestrated,

00:30:09.140 --> 00:30:13.345 align:middle line:84%
it's manipulated, so the law
gets passed in many cases

00:30:13.345 --> 00:30:15.213 align:middle line:84%
on the same day or
the day after.

00:30:15.213 --> 00:30:16.448 align:middle line:90%
>> Regina: Or Christmas Eve.

00:30:16.448 --> 00:30:18.617 align:middle line:84%
>> Josh: Right, when
everybody else is on holiday.

00:30:18.617 --> 00:30:21.286 align:middle line:84%
>> Regina: Hot toddies, yeah,
exactly, two people are left

00:30:21.286 --> 00:30:24.222 align:middle line:84%
in Congress, boom, Federal
Reserve and all that, yeah.

00:30:24.222 --> 00:30:25.156 align:middle line:90%
>> Josh: Exactly.

00:30:25.156 --> 00:30:26.491 align:middle line:84%
>> Regina: Okay,
so let's also talk

00:30:26.491 --> 00:30:32.063 align:middle line:84%
about how the alternative
energies are being suppressed,

00:30:32.063 --> 00:30:33.732 align:middle line:84%
because this is a
really big thing.

00:30:33.732 --> 00:30:37.602 align:middle line:84%
This is all happening in a time
when the utility companies,

00:30:37.602 --> 00:30:39.871 align:middle line:90%
they're dinosaurs, basically.

00:30:39.871 --> 00:30:42.173 align:middle line:84%
The way that they're
getting and utilizing,

00:30:42.173 --> 00:30:45.877 align:middle line:90%
distributing energy is so passe,

00:30:45.877 --> 00:30:47.712 align:middle line:84%
when there are so
many technologies.

00:30:47.712 --> 00:30:49.114 align:middle line:84%
Last time I saw you
a few weeks ago,

00:30:49.114 --> 00:30:51.316 align:middle line:84%
was at the Global BAM
technology conference.

00:30:51.316 --> 00:30:53.718 align:middle line:84%
There's so many beautiful
technologies on the horizon

00:30:53.718 --> 00:30:56.888 align:middle line:84%
that really are spilling
now into free energy,

00:30:56.888 --> 00:31:00.325 align:middle line:84%
and certainly passive,
non-invasive technologies

00:31:00.325 --> 00:31:02.394 align:middle line:84%
like solar and wind
and so forth.

00:31:02.394 --> 00:31:04.796 align:middle line:84%
Why is that not part
of all of this?

00:31:04.796 --> 00:31:07.532 align:middle line:84%
How is this continuing
down the same road?

00:31:07.532 --> 00:31:09.067 align:middle line:84%
>> Josh: Well, according
to the Federation

00:31:09.067 --> 00:31:11.603 align:middle line:84%
of American Scientists, again,
we go into this in the film,

00:31:11.603 --> 00:31:13.938 align:middle line:84%
more than 5,000 patents
have been suppressed

00:31:13.938 --> 00:31:16.474 align:middle line:84%
for various reasons in the
name of national security,

00:31:16.474 --> 00:31:19.844 align:middle line:84%
and they can be suppressed
by any agency

00:31:19.844 --> 00:31:22.147 align:middle line:90%
in the U.S. government,

00:31:22.147 --> 00:31:24.749 align:middle line:84%
including the Atomic Energy
Commission and so forth.

00:31:24.749 --> 00:31:27.952 align:middle line:84%
And so this is something that
has been kind of rumored about.

00:31:27.952 --> 00:31:32.123 align:middle line:84%
We hear about inventors who
come out with inventions,

00:31:32.123 --> 00:31:36.861 align:middle line:84%
and men in black suits show up
at their door or their silenced

00:31:36.861 --> 00:31:40.565 align:middle line:84%
or they're killed
off in many cases.

00:31:40.565 --> 00:31:43.034 align:middle line:90%
But now we have like evidence,

00:31:43.034 --> 00:31:45.336 align:middle line:84%
firsthand proof this
is actually happening,

00:31:45.336 --> 00:31:48.506 align:middle line:84%
and even in the patent
laws themselves they admit

00:31:48.506 --> 00:31:49.708 align:middle line:90%
that this is happening.

00:31:49.708 --> 00:31:52.877 align:middle line:84%
So the dots that we
connect in the film allow us

00:31:52.877 --> 00:31:56.915 align:middle line:84%
to see why it's happening and
other key pieces of information

00:31:56.915 --> 00:32:02.020 align:middle line:84%
around this to help us make
sense of this scenario.

00:32:02.020 --> 00:32:05.924 align:middle line:84%
And what seems to be the
case, according to my research

00:32:05.924 --> 00:32:08.993 align:middle line:90%
into this, is that suppression

00:32:08.993 --> 00:32:11.096 align:middle line:84%
of energy technology
is necessary

00:32:11.096 --> 00:32:13.031 align:middle line:84%
to implement a global
slave grid.

00:32:13.031 --> 00:32:14.299 align:middle line:90%
>> Regina: Absolutely.

00:32:14.299 --> 00:32:18.002 align:middle line:84%
>> Josh: And the smart grid
is the global slave grid

00:32:18.002 --> 00:32:23.041 align:middle line:84%
that was written about in
1948 in the book "1984."

00:32:23.041 --> 00:32:25.343 align:middle line:90%
>> Regina: Yes, absolutely.

00:32:25.343 --> 00:32:29.080 align:middle line:84%
And recently, again,
collusion on the part

00:32:29.080 --> 00:32:31.216 align:middle line:84%
of the energy companies
and the government,

00:32:31.216 --> 00:32:34.652 align:middle line:84%
the state of Arizona,
was recently trying to --

00:32:34.652 --> 00:32:36.888 align:middle line:84%
I think it was pass a
piece of legislation

00:32:36.888 --> 00:32:41.593 align:middle line:84%
that would have allowed for
$100 surcharge per month --

00:32:41.593 --> 00:32:44.362 align:middle line:84%
I believe it was per month,
on your bill if you were

00:32:44.362 --> 00:32:46.131 align:middle line:90%
to switch over to solar.

00:32:46.131 --> 00:32:47.799 align:middle line:90%
Anyway, that was truck down.

00:32:47.799 --> 00:32:50.034 align:middle line:84%
I think that was just
in the last two weeks,

00:32:50.034 --> 00:32:52.470 align:middle line:84%
so if I'm a little fuzzy on
details, people can look it up,

00:32:52.470 --> 00:32:53.671 align:middle line:90%
but that was struck down.

00:32:53.671 --> 00:32:56.374 align:middle line:84%
Thank God they had a
little common sense on that.

00:32:56.374 --> 00:32:59.210 align:middle line:84%
But let's talk about Spain,
and talk about what happened

00:32:59.210 --> 00:33:01.479 align:middle line:84%
with the solar initiatives
in Spain.

00:33:01.479 --> 00:33:03.448 align:middle line:90%
This is like crazy stuff.

00:33:03.448 --> 00:33:04.749 align:middle line:90%
>> Josh: It's unbelievable.

00:33:04.749 --> 00:33:08.553 align:middle line:84%
In Europe, you have the EU
publicly saying earlier this

00:33:08.553 --> 00:33:11.923 align:middle line:84%
year that we want to spend
$700 billion additional

00:33:11.923 --> 00:33:14.492 align:middle line:84%
for smart grid over the
next couple of decades,

00:33:14.492 --> 00:33:16.427 align:middle line:90%
700 billion worth of beads.

00:33:16.427 --> 00:33:17.762 align:middle line:90%
>> Regina: 700--

00:33:17.762 --> 00:33:18.830 align:middle line:84%
>> Josh: So we're talking
about an entire economy based

00:33:18.830 --> 00:33:21.599 align:middle line:84%
on smart grid infrastructure
here.

00:33:21.599 --> 00:33:27.572 align:middle line:84%
And then you have Spain about a
month later in July I believe,

00:33:27.572 --> 00:33:30.875 align:middle line:84%
passed a bill in
which collecting solar

00:33:30.875 --> 00:33:33.978 align:middle line:84%
for your own use, if it's
unauthorized collection

00:33:33.978 --> 00:33:37.382 align:middle line:84%
of solar energy, having a fee of
up to 30 million Euros per unit.

00:33:37.382 --> 00:33:39.083 align:middle line:90%
>> Regina: 30 million Euros.

00:33:39.083 --> 00:33:40.584 align:middle line:90%
>> Josh: 30 million Euros--

00:33:40.584 --> 00:33:43.021 align:middle line:84%
>> Regina: 30 million Euros
for collecting sunshine.

00:33:43.021 --> 00:33:46.157 align:middle line:84%
>> Josh: Unbelievable, so
that you know, another piece

00:33:46.157 --> 00:33:48.793 align:middle line:84%
of the puzzle in Europe
that's very, very interesting

00:33:48.793 --> 00:33:53.898 align:middle line:84%
on the positive side, is that
Germany has as of this summer,

00:33:53.898 --> 00:33:56.501 align:middle line:84%
basically come out and said,
we don't want Smart Meters.

00:33:56.501 --> 00:33:57.968 align:middle line:90%
They're not fitting

00:33:57.968 --> 00:34:04.209 align:middle line:84%
with a sustainable truly
democratic version of a grid

00:34:04.209 --> 00:34:06.811 align:middle line:84%
that we want to move towards,
so we're going to refuse them

00:34:06.811 --> 00:34:09.848 align:middle line:84%
on the basis of cost
and privacy.

00:34:09.848 --> 00:34:10.982 align:middle line:90%
>> Regina: Yes.

00:34:10.982 --> 00:34:12.083 align:middle line:84%
>> Josh: And what I feel
is happening there is

00:34:12.083 --> 00:34:14.419 align:middle line:84%
that Germany had their
run-in with fascism,

00:34:14.419 --> 00:34:16.787 align:middle line:84%
as we all know, just
70 years ago.

00:34:16.787 --> 00:34:18.590 align:middle line:90%
They experienced it firsthand.

00:34:18.590 --> 00:34:20.959 align:middle line:84%
They don't need to go
through this again.

00:34:20.959 --> 00:34:23.461 align:middle line:84%
The question is do
we, do we need to go

00:34:23.461 --> 00:34:25.729 align:middle line:84%
into full-blown fascism
before we're willing

00:34:25.729 --> 00:34:27.932 align:middle line:90%
to stand up and say no?

00:34:27.932 --> 00:34:30.468 align:middle line:84%
>> Regina: Well, and in
reality, we're dealing

00:34:30.468 --> 00:34:31.736 align:middle line:90%
with the leftovers of that.

00:34:31.736 --> 00:34:34.205 align:middle line:84%
If you're to read the work
of Jim Marrs and others,

00:34:34.205 --> 00:34:38.009 align:middle line:84%
that whole fascist regime,
and where the notion

00:34:38.009 --> 00:34:41.746 align:middle line:84%
of fashioning public
perception really became popular

00:34:41.746 --> 00:34:45.116 align:middle line:84%
and then exported,
Edward Renes and so forth.

00:34:45.116 --> 00:34:49.954 align:middle line:84%
That came from Nazi
Germany Those scientists

00:34:49.954 --> 00:34:54.359 align:middle line:84%
under Project Paperclip were
brilliant at understanding how

00:34:54.359 --> 00:34:58.796 align:middle line:84%
to influence masses, and that
became the advertising industry,

00:34:58.796 --> 00:35:00.198 align:middle line:90%
basically.

00:35:00.198 --> 00:35:03.401 align:middle line:84%
That was the bones and the basis
for the advertising industry.

00:35:03.401 --> 00:35:06.771 align:middle line:84%
So it would be totally right
that Germany, who has just

00:35:06.771 --> 00:35:08.740 align:middle line:84%
such a horror of what
happened in the past

00:35:08.740 --> 00:35:11.609 align:middle line:84%
in their own country, would
be so progressive in this way.

00:35:11.609 --> 00:35:14.946 align:middle line:84%
And also, they're so
heavily vested in both solar

00:35:14.946 --> 00:35:17.949 align:middle line:84%
and wind technology
even to this point now.

00:35:17.949 --> 00:35:21.252 align:middle line:84%
>> Josh: Yeah, the leading
technological country probably

00:35:21.252 --> 00:35:23.855 align:middle line:84%
on the planet is saying
no to Smart Meters

00:35:23.855 --> 00:35:26.157 align:middle line:84%
because they don't save
energy, they don't save money,

00:35:26.157 --> 00:35:29.928 align:middle line:84%
they don't work, they increase
cost and they invade privacy.

00:35:29.928 --> 00:35:31.896 align:middle line:84%
>> Regina: Leading us
back to a fascist state.

00:35:31.896 --> 00:35:35.233 align:middle line:84%
>> Josh: Right, but when you
have the leading technological

00:35:35.233 --> 00:35:37.568 align:middle line:84%
company -- and Germany's doing
some amazing things the last

00:35:37.568 --> 00:35:38.336 align:middle line:90%
couple of decades.

00:35:38.336 --> 00:35:39.470 align:middle line:90%
>> Regina: Yes.

00:35:39.470 --> 00:35:43.908 align:middle line:84%
>> Josh: I heard a stat
that 61% of their energy

00:35:43.908 --> 00:35:46.911 align:middle line:84%
of one particular day
several months ago came

00:35:46.911 --> 00:35:50.114 align:middle line:84%
from renewable sources,
wind and solar mostly.

00:35:50.114 --> 00:35:51.316 align:middle line:90%
>> Regina: Yes, yes.

00:35:51.316 --> 00:35:52.483 align:middle line:84%
>> Josh: So they're going
in the right direction

00:35:52.483 --> 00:35:53.885 align:middle line:84%
but at the same time
there is pressure on them

00:35:53.885 --> 00:35:57.922 align:middle line:84%
to lower the benefit
for solar energy.

00:35:57.922 --> 00:35:59.624 align:middle line:84%
>> Regina: God, I
hope they stand strong

00:35:59.624 --> 00:36:02.260 align:middle line:84%
so that they can be an example
to the rest of the world.

00:36:02.260 --> 00:36:03.995 align:middle line:84%
Okay, now it's time
to talk about some

00:36:03.995 --> 00:36:07.131 align:middle line:84%
of the really dastardly elements
of this, which has to do

00:36:07.131 --> 00:36:10.601 align:middle line:84%
with the radiation effects, the
radiation effects on our health

00:36:10.601 --> 00:36:14.138 align:middle line:84%
and well-being, and what
I'd like to do is start

00:36:14.138 --> 00:36:17.575 align:middle line:84%
out with a clip you have
from an old, old documentary.

00:36:17.575 --> 00:36:23.314 align:middle line:84%
It's slow and it's very precise
in what they're trying to show,

00:36:23.314 --> 00:36:25.917 align:middle line:84%
and so I just want everybody
to be very patient with it,

00:36:25.917 --> 00:36:30.154 align:middle line:84%
because to me it was just an
amazing clip, and the kicker is

00:36:30.154 --> 00:36:31.489 align:middle line:90%
at the very end of this clip.

00:36:31.489 --> 00:36:35.626 align:middle line:84%
So let's go ahead and show
what happens to little aphids

00:36:35.626 --> 00:36:36.961 align:middle line:84%
when they're going
about their business

00:36:36.961 --> 00:36:39.931 align:middle line:84%
when they're exposed
to radiation.

00:36:39.931 --> 00:36:42.500 align:middle line:84%
>> This picture shows
some aphids on the leaf

00:36:42.500 --> 00:36:46.804 align:middle line:84%
of an orange tree shortly after
radar equipment was installed

00:36:46.804 --> 00:36:50.408 align:middle line:84%
at a nearby airport a
number of years ago.

00:36:50.408 --> 00:36:54.078 align:middle line:84%
I notice that every few seconds,
all the aphids would tense

00:36:54.078 --> 00:36:57.181 align:middle line:84%
up in unison and
do sort of a dance,

00:36:57.181 --> 00:36:59.350 align:middle line:90%
as you see in the picture.

00:36:59.350 --> 00:37:03.755 align:middle line:84%
Upon further investigation, I
found that the interval of time

00:37:03.755 --> 00:37:07.592 align:middle line:84%
between the activity of
each dance coincided exactly

00:37:07.592 --> 00:37:12.330 align:middle line:84%
with the rotation of the radar
rotor device at the airport

00:37:12.330 --> 00:37:16.567 align:middle line:84%
which was a distance of
approximately 14 miles.

00:37:16.567 --> 00:37:19.904 align:middle line:84%
>> And we now have vast
amounts of published science

00:37:19.904 --> 00:37:23.007 align:middle line:84%
on microwave radiation
and health effects.

00:37:23.007 --> 00:37:24.208 align:middle line:90%
The data we're going to look

00:37:24.208 --> 00:37:26.778 align:middle line:84%
at are all published
science testing results

00:37:26.778 --> 00:37:27.845 align:middle line:90%
or public standards.

00:37:27.845 --> 00:37:30.515 align:middle line:84%
At the bottom end of
the radiation scale

00:37:30.515 --> 00:37:33.251 align:middle line:84%
of what's called power
density or signal strength,

00:37:33.251 --> 00:37:35.987 align:middle line:84%
is the minimum level at
which cell phones will work,

00:37:35.987 --> 00:37:37.955 align:middle line:84%
which was found to
be .2 billionths

00:37:37.955 --> 00:37:39.757 align:middle line:84%
of a microwatt per
centimeter squared.

00:37:39.757 --> 00:37:47.398 align:middle line:84%
Pine needles were found to
age prematurely at .000027.

00:37:47.398 --> 00:37:50.935 align:middle line:84%
At short-term exposures
of 0.5, children aged 8

00:37:50.935 --> 00:37:54.105 align:middle line:84%
to 17 experienced
headache, irritation,

00:37:54.105 --> 00:37:58.176 align:middle line:84%
concentration difficulties
and behavioral problems.

00:37:58.176 --> 00:38:01.813 align:middle line:84%
.1 is the biobiology or
building biology guideline

00:38:01.813 --> 00:38:03.981 align:middle line:90%
for extreme concern.

00:38:03.981 --> 00:38:07.485 align:middle line:84%
1.0 produced sperm DNA
fragmentation and a decrease

00:38:07.485 --> 00:38:10.455 align:middle line:90%
in sperm viability in vitro.

00:38:10.455 --> 00:38:13.724 align:middle line:84%
Also, at 1.0 the science shows
the following bodily effects can

00:38:13.724 --> 00:38:18.463 align:middle line:84%
occur: headaches, dizziness,
fatigue, insomnia, chest pain,

00:38:18.463 --> 00:38:20.398 align:middle line:84%
difficulty breathing,
and indigestion.

00:38:20.398 --> 00:38:24.602 align:middle line:84%
2.5 saw altered calcium
metabolism

00:38:24.602 --> 00:38:27.338 align:middle line:90%
in heart muscle cells, 4.0,

00:38:27.338 --> 00:38:29.807 align:middle line:84%
changes in the hippocampus
affecting brain memory

00:38:29.807 --> 00:38:30.875 align:middle line:90%
and learning.

00:38:30.875 --> 00:38:34.512 align:middle line:84%
And at 6.0, DNA damaged
the cells.

00:38:34.512 --> 00:38:37.982 align:middle line:84%
So where are Smart
Meters on this list?

00:38:37.982 --> 00:38:40.918 align:middle line:84%
Electrical Power
Institute in December 2010,

00:38:40.918 --> 00:38:43.554 align:middle line:84%
measured a single Itron
Smart Meter with pulses

00:38:43.554 --> 00:38:47.725 align:middle line:84%
up to 7.93 microwatts
per centimeter squared.

00:38:47.725 --> 00:38:50.795 align:middle line:84%
Our own testing indicated
approximately 8.0

00:38:50.795 --> 00:38:51.863 align:middle line:90%
with one meter.

00:38:51.863 --> 00:38:53.865 align:middle line:84%
These tests are at
a close distance,

00:38:53.865 --> 00:38:55.967 align:middle line:84%
approximately one foot
away from the meter,

00:38:55.967 --> 00:38:58.703 align:middle line:84%
but an infant's crib can be
just as close on the other side

00:38:58.703 --> 00:39:01.739 align:middle line:84%
of the wall, where the meter or
bank of meters are installed.

00:39:01.739 --> 00:39:04.842 align:middle line:84%
Even though there are all
these known health effects

00:39:04.842 --> 00:39:07.612 align:middle line:84%
at levels far lower,
Switzerland, Liechtenstein

00:39:07.612 --> 00:39:11.115 align:middle line:84%
and Luxembourg see fit to
set the standard at 9.5.

00:39:11.115 --> 00:39:15.386 align:middle line:84%
And China, Poland
and Russia, 10.0.

00:39:15.386 --> 00:39:18.689 align:middle line:84%
This is the same level at which
behavior has been altered,

00:39:18.689 --> 00:39:22.493 align:middle line:84%
producing reflexes of avoidance
following 30-minute exposures.

00:39:22.493 --> 00:39:25.163 align:middle line:90%
A room of 12 Smart Meters,

00:39:25.163 --> 00:39:27.498 align:middle line:84%
very common in even
a conservative number

00:39:27.498 --> 00:39:28.800 align:middle line:90%
in an apartment building,

00:39:28.800 --> 00:39:33.004 align:middle line:84%
tested at 19.8 microwatts
per centimeter squared.

00:39:33.004 --> 00:39:35.039 align:middle line:84%
This is hundreds of
times higher than levels

00:39:35.039 --> 00:39:37.308 align:middle line:84%
which clearly indicate
harmful effects.

00:39:37.308 --> 00:39:43.281 align:middle line:90%
>> Regina: I love that graph.

00:39:43.281 --> 00:39:45.016 align:middle line:90%
That pretty much says it all.

00:39:45.016 --> 00:39:46.984 align:middle line:84%
That's what we're
being exposed to.

00:39:46.984 --> 00:39:49.353 align:middle line:84%
And that list of where the
problems start beginning,

00:39:49.353 --> 00:39:51.956 align:middle line:84%
dizziness, headaches,
indigestion,

00:39:51.956 --> 00:39:54.458 align:middle line:84%
I'm sure insomnia is
part of that, too.

00:39:54.458 --> 00:39:55.226 align:middle line:90%
>> Josh: Right.

00:39:55.226 --> 00:39:56.027 align:middle line:90%
>> Regina: This is common.

00:39:56.027 --> 00:39:56.994 align:middle line:90%
This is how people live now.

00:39:56.994 --> 00:39:58.763 align:middle line:90%
We just take little band-aids

00:39:58.763 --> 00:40:01.132 align:middle line:84%
and over-the-counter
pills to take care of it.

00:40:01.132 --> 00:40:02.533 align:middle line:90%
>> Josh: Right.

00:40:02.533 --> 00:40:04.835 align:middle line:84%
We don't know why, we mask the
symptoms, but we don't know why.

00:40:04.835 --> 00:40:06.537 align:middle line:90%
That's the key point here,

00:40:06.537 --> 00:40:09.006 align:middle line:84%
is that the science
has been masked,

00:40:09.006 --> 00:40:10.908 align:middle line:90%
the science has been skewed

00:40:10.908 --> 00:40:15.713 align:middle line:84%
from corporate interests
since like the 1950s.

00:40:15.713 --> 00:40:19.784 align:middle line:84%
So the industry has taken
a position arbitrarily

00:40:19.784 --> 00:40:23.087 align:middle line:84%
that despite thousands of
studies to show that this type

00:40:23.087 --> 00:40:25.156 align:middle line:84%
of radiation is having
health problems

00:40:25.156 --> 00:40:27.525 align:middle line:90%
and health effects biologically,

00:40:27.525 --> 00:40:29.193 align:middle line:84%
through peer-reviewed
published science--

00:40:29.193 --> 00:40:30.595 align:middle line:90%
>> Regina: Yes.

00:40:30.595 --> 00:40:31.862 align:middle line:84%
>> Josh: -- they've taken the
arbitrary stand that there's no

00:40:31.862 --> 00:40:35.733 align:middle line:84%
such thing -- we don't
recognize non-thermal effects,

00:40:35.733 --> 00:40:38.502 align:middle line:84%
which means that if the
microwave radiation doesn't heat

00:40:38.502 --> 00:40:42.139 align:middle line:84%
up tissue, in their
opinion there's no harm,

00:40:42.139 --> 00:40:44.809 align:middle line:84%
which is unbelievable to
think of, that there's

00:40:44.809 --> 00:40:46.878 align:middle line:84%
that many science
that show harm.

00:40:46.878 --> 00:40:51.482 align:middle line:84%
And not only that, but they have
never even tested smart meters

00:40:51.482 --> 00:40:53.618 align:middle line:90%
for safety, at all.

00:40:53.618 --> 00:40:57.622 align:middle line:84%
There's been no industry or
government testing for safety

00:40:57.622 --> 00:41:00.057 align:middle line:84%
for health and safety
from smart meters.

00:41:00.057 --> 00:41:04.161 align:middle line:84%
>> Regina: Okay, you were
talking about a bank of meters

00:41:04.161 --> 00:41:06.163 align:middle line:84%
that can end up on the
outside of a building

00:41:06.163 --> 00:41:07.465 align:middle line:90%
or an apartment building.

00:41:07.465 --> 00:41:09.700 align:middle line:84%
And I've heard from
people personally what kind

00:41:09.700 --> 00:41:13.237 align:middle line:84%
of problems they've had once
this has happened, because a lot

00:41:13.237 --> 00:41:16.841 align:middle line:84%
of times they have no idea their
meters have been swapped out.

00:41:16.841 --> 00:41:18.676 align:middle line:84%
The health effects start
and they start saying,

00:41:18.676 --> 00:41:20.044 align:middle line:90%
geez, what's different?

00:41:20.044 --> 00:41:22.046 align:middle line:84%
What has happened
to create this?

00:41:22.046 --> 00:41:23.547 align:middle line:84%
And they find out
long after the fact.

00:41:23.547 --> 00:41:25.850 align:middle line:84%
And we're going to take
a look at another clip.

00:41:25.850 --> 00:41:27.318 align:middle line:84%
We have three more
clips to look at,

00:41:27.318 --> 00:41:29.720 align:middle line:84%
so we have to kind
of move on through.

00:41:29.720 --> 00:41:33.591 align:middle line:84%
An elderly woman who was
testifying before SMUD

00:41:33.591 --> 00:41:38.062 align:middle line:84%
in Sacramento Municipal
Utility District,

00:41:38.062 --> 00:41:39.730 align:middle line:90%
and what happened with her.

00:41:39.730 --> 00:41:42.066 align:middle line:84%
And then there's another
one I want to talk to you

00:41:42.066 --> 00:41:43.534 align:middle line:84%
about that we're not
going to show a clip for.

00:41:43.534 --> 00:41:48.372 align:middle line:84%
So let's take a look at
the elderly woman at SMUD.

00:41:48.372 --> 00:41:50.975 align:middle line:84%
>> After having 12
upgraded meters installed

00:41:50.975 --> 00:41:54.578 align:middle line:84%
on her bedroom wall, Rosa Parrot
began experiencing headaches

00:41:54.578 --> 00:41:56.514 align:middle line:90%
and insomnia.

00:41:56.514 --> 00:42:02.553 align:middle line:84%
>> I lived through Nazi
Communist soldiers, Kazaks --

00:42:02.553 --> 00:42:08.025 align:middle line:84%
nobody damaged my health as
much as smart meters did.

00:42:08.025 --> 00:42:13.998 align:middle line:84%
This is supposed to
be my golden years.

00:42:13.998 --> 00:42:19.537 align:middle line:90%
Instead these are my bad years.

00:42:19.537 --> 00:42:24.208 align:middle line:90%
You did not give me all options.

00:42:24.208 --> 00:42:27.645 align:middle line:84%
When you came and installed,
you did not give me option.

00:42:27.645 --> 00:42:29.513 align:middle line:90%
I did not have no option.

00:42:29.513 --> 00:42:34.218 align:middle line:84%
You came after me,
you pursued me.

00:42:34.218 --> 00:42:36.787 align:middle line:90%
I have something to show you.

00:42:36.787 --> 00:42:40.224 align:middle line:84%
I have no control when
I'm going to bleed,

00:42:40.224 --> 00:42:42.159 align:middle line:90%
when my nose is going to bleed.

00:42:42.159 --> 00:42:44.295 align:middle line:90%
This is the blood from my nose.

00:42:44.295 --> 00:42:49.433 align:middle line:84%
I cannot even sleep
on my own bed anymore.

00:42:49.433 --> 00:42:53.938 align:middle line:84%
I have to close the door to
the bedroom and sleep on chairs

00:42:53.938 --> 00:42:56.640 align:middle line:84%
in the living room, or
put the mattress down,

00:42:56.640 --> 00:42:57.975 align:middle line:90%
sleeping bag on the floor.

00:42:57.975 --> 00:43:06.517 align:middle line:84%
>> Do you ever have nose bleeds
away from your apartment?

00:43:07.351 --> 00:43:08.052 align:middle line:90%
>> I'm sorry; your time is up.

00:43:08.052 --> 00:43:09.820 align:middle line:90%
>> Thank you very much.

00:43:09.820 --> 00:43:12.123 align:middle line:90%
>> I appreciate your coming.

00:43:12.123 --> 00:43:13.057 align:middle line:90%
>> Your time is up.

00:43:13.057 --> 00:43:15.993 align:middle line:90%
>> Your time is up.

00:43:15.993 --> 00:43:18.696 align:middle line:90%
>> Thank you.

00:43:18.696 --> 00:43:21.499 align:middle line:84%
>> Regina: Lot of caring
going on there, huh?

00:43:21.499 --> 00:43:22.867 align:middle line:90%
>> Josh: Right.

00:43:22.867 --> 00:43:24.535 align:middle line:84%
>> Regina: And let's talk about
another woman in your film,

00:43:24.535 --> 00:43:26.203 align:middle line:84%
this one of course,
everyone gets teared

00:43:26.203 --> 00:43:27.438 align:middle line:90%
up when they see this.

00:43:27.438 --> 00:43:30.941 align:middle line:84%
It's just -- because it
just makes you want to cry,

00:43:30.941 --> 00:43:36.747 align:middle line:84%
a woman whose son was at
California State-San Diego,

00:43:36.747 --> 00:43:40.684 align:middle line:84%
he was living in a particular
dorm it was right under --

00:43:40.684 --> 00:43:42.219 align:middle line:90%
was it a cellular tower?

00:43:42.219 --> 00:43:43.554 align:middle line:84%
>> Josh: It was right
at the base of, yeah,

00:43:43.554 --> 00:43:47.892 align:middle line:84%
it was a particular lab where
he and a bunch of students

00:43:47.892 --> 00:43:50.528 align:middle line:84%
and faculty spent
most of their time.

00:43:50.528 --> 00:43:51.362 align:middle line:90%
>> Regina: Okay.

00:43:51.362 --> 00:43:55.332 align:middle line:90%
Talk about what happened there.

00:43:55.332 --> 00:44:00.504 align:middle line:84%
>> Josh: So Rich Farber is
his name, passed away in 2008

00:44:00.504 --> 00:44:04.175 align:middle line:84%
from a type of brain cancer
that is directly linked

00:44:04.175 --> 00:44:06.177 align:middle line:90%
to microwave radiation.

00:44:06.177 --> 00:44:09.680 align:middle line:84%
And his mother, Virginia,
found out about a year later,

00:44:09.680 --> 00:44:15.152 align:middle line:84%
give or take, that only that
Rich passed away, who was based

00:44:15.152 --> 00:44:22.626 align:middle line:84%
in UCSD in a specific
room at the base of this--

00:44:22.626 --> 00:44:26.564 align:middle line:84%
>> Regina: 134 or some --
specific room they all are in.

00:44:26.564 --> 00:44:28.399 align:middle line:84%
>> Josh: 131 in which
they're all in.

00:44:28.399 --> 00:44:32.069 align:middle line:84%
So there was a cancer cluster
there in which she uncovered

00:44:32.069 --> 00:44:36.307 align:middle line:90%
that 8 or 9 people have died

00:44:36.307 --> 00:44:38.142 align:middle line:84%
with the same type
of brain cancer.

00:44:38.142 --> 00:44:39.743 align:middle line:84%
>> Regina: All young,
healthy people.

00:44:39.743 --> 00:44:43.547 align:middle line:84%
>> Josh: Young, healthy people,
both students and faculty,

00:44:43.547 --> 00:44:46.484 align:middle line:84%
and she tried to
contact the university.

00:44:46.484 --> 00:44:47.818 align:middle line:90%
So got nowhere.

00:44:47.818 --> 00:44:50.921 align:middle line:84%
She went to the press in
San Diego, she got nowhere,

00:44:50.921 --> 00:44:52.690 align:middle line:84%
even reporters said
the story's never going

00:44:52.690 --> 00:44:54.391 align:middle line:90%
to get out because of money.

00:44:54.391 --> 00:44:58.762 align:middle line:84%
So we felt this absolutely
needs to get out.

00:44:58.762 --> 00:45:02.266 align:middle line:84%
The public needs to be
aware of what's going on

00:45:02.266 --> 00:45:06.804 align:middle line:84%
and a massive cover-up going
on between the health effects

00:45:06.804 --> 00:45:11.242 align:middle line:84%
of microwave radiation and the
industry's involvement there.

00:45:11.242 --> 00:45:14.712 align:middle line:84%
>> Regina: I interviewed a woman
named Dawn Fisher a few years

00:45:14.712 --> 00:45:15.980 align:middle line:90%
ago, which people can find

00:45:15.980 --> 00:45:19.583 align:middle line:84%
in the Conscious Media
network archives here at Gaiam,

00:45:19.583 --> 00:45:22.386 align:middle line:84%
and she talked about dirty
electricity, which she took

00:45:22.386 --> 00:45:25.523 align:middle line:84%
on because she had a lot of
the symptomatic effects of it

00:45:25.523 --> 00:45:29.326 align:middle line:84%
in Australia, and found
that it wasn't uncommon

00:45:29.326 --> 00:45:33.697 align:middle line:84%
to have these cancer
clusters around schools.

00:45:33.697 --> 00:45:34.532 align:middle line:90%
>> Josh: Right.

00:45:34.532 --> 00:45:38.369 align:middle line:90%
We are electromagnetic beings.

00:45:38.369 --> 00:45:41.305 align:middle line:90%
I mean, we know that.

00:45:41.305 --> 00:45:43.974 align:middle line:84%
Despite mainstream
science's attempts just

00:45:43.974 --> 00:45:47.077 align:middle line:84%
to convince us it's just
matter and chemistry,

00:45:47.077 --> 00:45:50.147 align:middle line:84%
we are electromagnetic beings,
and when you start messing

00:45:50.147 --> 00:45:54.618 align:middle line:84%
with basic biological systems
that are the foundation

00:45:54.618 --> 00:45:57.588 align:middle line:84%
of our wellness in our
body, our nervous system,

00:45:57.588 --> 00:46:00.958 align:middle line:84%
thought processes and
basic electrical systems --

00:46:00.958 --> 00:46:03.093 align:middle line:84%
our heart is an electrical
organ.

00:46:03.093 --> 00:46:06.297 align:middle line:84%
It functions on the
same principles.

00:46:06.297 --> 00:46:08.132 align:middle line:84%
>> Regina: And these
interfere with Pacemakers even.

00:46:08.132 --> 00:46:09.433 align:middle line:84%
>> Josh: These interfere
with Pacemakers.

00:46:09.433 --> 00:46:13.304 align:middle line:84%
And the number, the
sheer number of people,

00:46:13.304 --> 00:46:15.439 align:middle line:84%
that are reporting
health problems

00:46:15.439 --> 00:46:19.310 align:middle line:84%
after smart meters get
installed is just staggering.

00:46:19.310 --> 00:46:22.680 align:middle line:84%
>> Regina: Okay, and a lot of
times we think, those kids,

00:46:22.680 --> 00:46:25.449 align:middle line:84%
and the professors
there, were right next

00:46:25.449 --> 00:46:28.953 align:middle line:84%
to obviously a large
transmitting device

00:46:28.953 --> 00:46:30.120 align:middle line:90%
of some kind.

00:46:30.120 --> 00:46:33.857 align:middle line:84%
And then others will
say, so problematic, sad,

00:46:33.857 --> 00:46:36.026 align:middle line:90%
but that was a bad place to be.

00:46:36.026 --> 00:46:38.729 align:middle line:84%
But then you actually went
to the trouble to talk

00:46:38.729 --> 00:46:45.002 align:middle line:84%
to a chiropractor who uses dark
field microscopy and blood work,

00:46:45.002 --> 00:46:47.938 align:middle line:84%
and he did a small
sample of blood.

00:46:47.938 --> 00:46:52.009 align:middle line:84%
But the point was, it was just
blood from ordinary people.

00:46:52.009 --> 00:46:54.345 align:middle line:84%
It wasn't anyone that
lived in a cancer cluster

00:46:54.345 --> 00:46:57.081 align:middle line:84%
or near a cell tower,
anything like that.

00:46:57.081 --> 00:46:59.850 align:middle line:84%
And we're finding this
is a bigger question.

00:46:59.850 --> 00:47:03.854 align:middle line:84%
Just because you're not
symptomatic doesn't mean you're

00:47:03.854 --> 00:47:06.156 align:middle line:84%
not experiencing
internal damage.

00:47:06.156 --> 00:47:08.993 align:middle line:84%
The health of the blood
is the health of the body

00:47:08.993 --> 00:47:10.594 align:middle line:90%
and the being over time.

00:47:10.594 --> 00:47:11.962 align:middle line:90%
I have that pulled.

00:47:11.962 --> 00:47:13.130 align:middle line:90%
Can we look at that clip?

00:47:13.130 --> 00:47:13.897 align:middle line:90%
>> Josh: Absolutely.

00:47:13.897 --> 00:47:14.531 align:middle line:90%
>> Regina: Let's do that.

00:47:14.531 --> 00:47:16.600 align:middle line:90%
It's interesting.

00:47:16.600 --> 00:47:19.637 align:middle line:84%
>> Can you share about
people coming to you as far

00:47:19.637 --> 00:47:22.506 align:middle line:84%
as having complaints
about illness?

00:47:22.506 --> 00:47:24.875 align:middle line:84%
>> We were made aware of
health complaints following

00:47:24.875 --> 00:47:27.077 align:middle line:84%
installation of smart
meters, and we wanted

00:47:27.077 --> 00:47:31.882 align:middle line:84%
to verify this using our field
work, so I measured the field

00:47:31.882 --> 00:47:35.386 align:middle line:84%
of about 30 different people
while they stood one foot

00:47:35.386 --> 00:47:38.455 align:middle line:84%
in front of the smart meter,
and in every single case,

00:47:38.455 --> 00:47:42.693 align:middle line:84%
the human energy field was
obliterated as they stood

00:47:42.693 --> 00:47:44.495 align:middle line:90%
in front of the smart meter.

00:47:44.495 --> 00:47:47.698 align:middle line:90%
We wanted to then verify this

00:47:47.698 --> 00:47:50.734 align:middle line:84%
at the physical level using
dark field microscopy,

00:47:50.734 --> 00:47:52.903 align:middle line:84%
and then we also did a
control group to find

00:47:52.903 --> 00:47:55.572 align:middle line:84%
out if the old analog
meters had the same effect

00:47:55.572 --> 00:47:58.809 align:middle line:90%
on the blood as the smart meter.

00:47:58.809 --> 00:48:02.780 align:middle line:84%
So in our first slides
what we see is normal cells

00:48:02.780 --> 00:48:06.250 align:middle line:84%
and the structure of the
cells is intact and sound.

00:48:06.250 --> 00:48:10.287 align:middle line:84%
This is what we would
expect from a normal sample.

00:48:10.287 --> 00:48:12.356 align:middle line:84%
With the subject
standing one foot in front

00:48:12.356 --> 00:48:15.092 align:middle line:84%
of the analog meter, there
were no significant changes

00:48:15.092 --> 00:48:18.929 align:middle line:84%
to these blood samples in any
of the three that we tested.

00:48:20.264 --> 00:48:23.067 align:middle line:84%
In our second set of tests,
we're using the smart meter.

00:48:23.067 --> 00:48:25.469 align:middle line:84%
Before the exposure,
we see the same thing

00:48:25.469 --> 00:48:27.971 align:middle line:90%
as we saw in the first samples.

00:48:27.971 --> 00:48:32.109 align:middle line:84%
Normal cell walls fairly
separated, and looking healthy.

00:48:32.109 --> 00:48:35.079 align:middle line:84%
So after two minutes of exposure
in front of the smart meter

00:48:35.079 --> 00:48:39.550 align:middle line:84%
at about one foot away, we
see a totally different story.

00:48:39.550 --> 00:48:42.686 align:middle line:84%
Sample one, you can see a lot
of degradation in the cells.

00:48:42.686 --> 00:48:46.957 align:middle line:84%
The cell walls have been broken,
and you see changes in the cells

00:48:46.957 --> 00:48:48.425 align:middle line:90%
which are called mycoplasma.

00:48:48.425 --> 00:48:50.728 align:middle line:90%
It shows a mutation to the cell.

00:48:50.728 --> 00:48:54.231 align:middle line:84%
In the second sample, we see a
different type of degradation

00:48:54.231 --> 00:48:55.799 align:middle line:90%
to the cell membranes.

00:48:55.799 --> 00:48:57.601 align:middle line:90%
You can see a corrugation here.

00:48:57.601 --> 00:49:01.505 align:middle line:84%
This is called bottle cap
formation, and it's known

00:49:01.505 --> 00:49:03.907 align:middle line:84%
that this occurs
due to oxidation

00:49:03.907 --> 00:49:07.244 align:middle line:90%
or exposure to free radicals.

00:49:07.244 --> 00:49:10.547 align:middle line:84%
So this third subject,
when we did her sample,

00:49:10.547 --> 00:49:14.651 align:middle line:84%
she had to be pulled away from
the meter after 45 seconds

00:49:14.651 --> 00:49:18.322 align:middle line:84%
because she complained about an
increasingly severe headache,

00:49:18.322 --> 00:49:21.425 align:middle line:84%
and here you see a
phenomenon called rouleaux,

00:49:21.425 --> 00:49:24.128 align:middle line:84%
where the red blood
cells are stacking up,

00:49:24.128 --> 00:49:27.731 align:middle line:84%
which makes it very difficult
for the blood to deliver oxygen

00:49:27.731 --> 00:49:30.968 align:middle line:84%
to the tissues as they would
be their normal function.

00:49:30.968 --> 00:49:33.403 align:middle line:84%
Every single one of
these is a degradation.

00:49:33.403 --> 00:49:36.473 align:middle line:84%
Every single one of these shows
a trauma to the blood cells,

00:49:36.473 --> 00:49:38.308 align:middle line:90%
and that came from something

00:49:38.308 --> 00:49:40.577 align:middle line:84%
and the only variable
was the smart meter.

00:49:40.577 --> 00:49:43.280 align:middle line:84%
The good news in all
of this is the patient

00:49:43.280 --> 00:49:44.548 align:middle line:90%
and the blood can return

00:49:44.548 --> 00:49:46.850 align:middle line:84%
to normal once they
have been removed

00:49:46.850 --> 00:49:49.820 align:middle line:84%
from the influences
of these stressors.

00:49:51.021 --> 00:49:55.526 align:middle line:84%
>> So this thing about
electrosensitive 3 or 5%,

00:49:55.526 --> 00:49:58.095 align:middle line:84%
people are affected and
everyone else is okay,

00:49:58.095 --> 00:50:00.197 align:middle line:84%
what do you have
to say about that?

00:50:00.197 --> 00:50:03.367 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, everybody we've tested
so far has been affected,

00:50:03.367 --> 00:50:06.737 align:middle line:84%
and we know everybody
that I tested to see

00:50:06.737 --> 00:50:09.406 align:middle line:84%
if there was a change in
the body's energy field,

00:50:09.406 --> 00:50:12.576 align:middle line:84%
every single person I
tested was affected.

00:50:12.576 --> 00:50:15.512 align:middle line:84%
So 3 out of 3 people
were affected negatively?

00:50:15.512 --> 00:50:18.482 align:middle line:90%
One of them became symptomatic,

00:50:18.482 --> 00:50:20.717 align:middle line:84%
the other two didn't have
any noticeable symptoms,

00:50:20.717 --> 00:50:24.788 align:middle line:84%
yet the changes showed
up in the blood.

00:50:24.788 --> 00:50:29.193 align:middle line:84%
There are changes whether
they feel them or not.

00:50:29.193 --> 00:50:31.094 align:middle line:84%
>> Regina: The quality of
your blood is the quality

00:50:31.094 --> 00:50:32.396 align:middle line:90%
of your health and your life.

00:50:32.396 --> 00:50:33.697 align:middle line:84%
>> Josh: That's right,
and in addition

00:50:33.697 --> 00:50:37.000 align:middle line:84%
to the dark field microscopy
there's other research

00:50:37.000 --> 00:50:41.038 align:middle line:84%
that we've done that's also in
the film, that shows a number

00:50:41.038 --> 00:50:44.341 align:middle line:84%
of inflammatory markers,
all increasing

00:50:44.341 --> 00:50:47.010 align:middle line:84%
after a meter gets
installed, both from those

00:50:47.010 --> 00:50:49.613 align:middle line:90%
who feel it and those who don't.

00:50:49.613 --> 00:50:53.650 align:middle line:84%
I would say this, is that
we spoke briefly earlier

00:50:53.650 --> 00:50:57.287 align:middle line:84%
about our conscious intention,
our ability to create reality

00:50:57.287 --> 00:50:58.655 align:middle line:84%
in our being and
around our body.

00:50:58.655 --> 00:51:00.057 align:middle line:90%
>> Regina: Yes.

00:51:00.057 --> 00:51:02.926 align:middle line:84%
>> Josh: We can, I feel that we
can access a level of authority

00:51:02.926 --> 00:51:05.929 align:middle line:84%
in which we can shield
ourselves through our intention

00:51:05.929 --> 00:51:09.299 align:middle line:84%
and through various spiritual
techniques, but by default,

00:51:09.299 --> 00:51:12.569 align:middle line:84%
Regina, everybody appears to
be affected on some level.

00:51:12.569 --> 00:51:15.505 align:middle line:84%
>> Regina: And the thing is,
there are doctors, there are MDs

00:51:15.505 --> 00:51:17.708 align:middle line:84%
like this man, and there
are other scientists

00:51:17.708 --> 00:51:20.010 align:middle line:84%
that have been attempting
to speak up,

00:51:20.010 --> 00:51:22.412 align:middle line:90%
but when they do, what happens?

00:51:22.412 --> 00:51:25.215 align:middle line:84%
>> Josh: Well, they effectively
are putting their careers

00:51:25.215 --> 00:51:29.052 align:middle line:84%
in jeopardy or on
the line, and again,

00:51:29.052 --> 00:51:32.022 align:middle line:84%
we have some whistleblowers,
some scientist whistleblowers

00:51:32.022 --> 00:51:36.693 align:middle line:84%
in the film that speak
more in depth about that.

00:51:36.693 --> 00:51:39.730 align:middle line:84%
>> Regina: Let's talk
about when you decide to go

00:51:39.730 --> 00:51:42.065 align:middle line:84%
up against them,
you, as a homeowner.

00:51:42.065 --> 00:51:44.601 align:middle line:90%
And you have a clip in the film.

00:51:44.601 --> 00:51:46.270 align:middle line:90%
It's really shocking.

00:51:46.270 --> 00:51:50.540 align:middle line:84%
It's a mother who is standing up
for herself, and you also have

00:51:50.540 --> 00:51:53.143 align:middle line:84%
in there some people who
have stood up for themselves

00:51:53.143 --> 00:51:57.581 align:middle line:84%
in Los Angeles who were being
very negatively impacted.

00:51:57.581 --> 00:51:59.149 align:middle line:84%
Their children were
being impacted,

00:51:59.149 --> 00:52:01.718 align:middle line:84%
and they actually went
before the city council

00:52:01.718 --> 00:52:03.120 align:middle line:90%
and stood up for their rights.

00:52:03.120 --> 00:52:06.657 align:middle line:84%
It was two African American
women, very brave to do that,

00:52:06.657 --> 00:52:09.359 align:middle line:84%
and one of the Councilmembers
actually said, "We're going

00:52:09.359 --> 00:52:11.561 align:middle line:90%
to look into this today."

00:52:11.561 --> 00:52:13.730 align:middle line:84%
And let's talk about what
happened there before we go any

00:52:13.730 --> 00:52:15.832 align:middle line:84%
further, after the
councilmember looked into it.

00:52:15.832 --> 00:52:17.034 align:middle line:90%
>> Josh: Absolutely.

00:52:17.034 --> 00:52:19.369 align:middle line:84%
And so the next day, their
smart meter got pulled

00:52:19.369 --> 00:52:20.804 align:middle line:90%
and an analog meter,

00:52:20.804 --> 00:52:23.340 align:middle line:84%
non-wireless analog
meter was replaced

00:52:23.340 --> 00:52:25.208 align:middle line:84%
and the situation
was taken care of.

00:52:25.208 --> 00:52:27.844 align:middle line:84%
Now the city council -- this is
important for people to note,

00:52:27.844 --> 00:52:31.748 align:middle line:84%
is that the city councils do not
have the facts on this, Regina.

00:52:31.748 --> 00:52:35.953 align:middle line:84%
If they have any facts, it's
the propaganda or downright lies

00:52:35.953 --> 00:52:39.890 align:middle line:84%
that are being released by
utilities and governments.

00:52:39.890 --> 00:52:43.794 align:middle line:84%
So it's imperative to anyone
watching this right now,

00:52:43.794 --> 00:52:47.097 align:middle line:84%
to make sure your city
council has the facts.

00:52:47.097 --> 00:52:50.367 align:middle line:84%
One of the ways that people are
doing this is with our film,

00:52:50.367 --> 00:52:52.235 align:middle line:90%
Take Back the Power, and people

00:52:52.235 --> 00:52:54.771 align:middle line:84%
in some states are
actually acting on behalf

00:52:54.771 --> 00:52:56.907 align:middle line:84%
of their entire state
or their region,

00:52:56.907 --> 00:53:01.244 align:middle line:84%
buying at below wholesale,
a couple hundred DVDs,

00:53:01.244 --> 00:53:04.348 align:middle line:84%
sending them to every
elected public official

00:53:04.348 --> 00:53:07.784 align:middle line:84%
in the state along with
a notice of liability,

00:53:07.784 --> 00:53:10.087 align:middle line:84%
which we're now working
with others to draft.

00:53:10.087 --> 00:53:11.688 align:middle line:84%
>> Regina: Do you have
attorneys involved in that?

00:53:11.688 --> 00:53:14.458 align:middle line:84%
>> Josh: We have people who are
very, very expert and involved

00:53:14.458 --> 00:53:19.196 align:middle line:84%
in understanding at a very high
level of law, it's unlawful

00:53:19.196 --> 00:53:25.736 align:middle line:84%
and illegal document that's
being developed as we speak,

00:53:25.736 --> 00:53:29.373 align:middle line:84%
that certain states have
already, and representatives

00:53:29.373 --> 00:53:33.944 align:middle line:84%
of this movement in states have
already taken advantage of.

00:53:33.944 --> 00:53:38.582 align:middle line:84%
So this we feel, is a way in
which anyone who's passionate

00:53:38.582 --> 00:53:40.550 align:middle line:84%
about this and has
the means to do so,

00:53:40.550 --> 00:53:44.654 align:middle line:84%
whether you're an individual
or a group, can get this film

00:53:44.654 --> 00:53:48.825 align:middle line:84%
and get the facts in a powerful
document that goes along

00:53:48.825 --> 00:53:52.029 align:middle line:84%
with the film, in a way that's
pretty much irrefutable,

00:53:52.029 --> 00:53:55.899 align:middle line:84%
that puts them on the hook
financially for the damage

00:53:55.899 --> 00:53:58.935 align:middle line:84%
and the harm that they're doing
by allowing this to continue.

00:53:58.935 --> 00:54:02.706 align:middle line:84%
So if they don't act in the
interests, in the best interests

00:54:02.706 --> 00:54:06.510 align:middle line:84%
of the people, then they will
be financially liable according

00:54:06.510 --> 00:54:10.213 align:middle line:84%
to this contract law or
commerce-based agreement,

00:54:10.213 --> 00:54:12.949 align:middle line:84%
which we have the
ability to create,

00:54:12.949 --> 00:54:16.420 align:middle line:84%
just as corporations create
agreements with us mostly

00:54:16.420 --> 00:54:17.888 align:middle line:90%
through tacit acceptance.

00:54:17.888 --> 00:54:18.822 align:middle line:90%
>> Regina: Right.

00:54:18.822 --> 00:54:22.492 align:middle line:84%
And even though --
it's essential.

00:54:22.492 --> 00:54:23.660 align:middle line:90%
This is why I'm so excited

00:54:23.660 --> 00:54:25.495 align:middle line:84%
about what you're
doing, this is happening.

00:54:25.495 --> 00:54:28.398 align:middle line:84%
But as we talked about at the
beginning of this conversation,

00:54:28.398 --> 00:54:31.201 align:middle line:84%
there are cities who have
already placed moratoriums

00:54:31.201 --> 00:54:33.670 align:middle line:84%
on the installation of these
things, and many more cities

00:54:33.670 --> 00:54:36.740 align:middle line:84%
who are in the process, but
the utility companies totally

00:54:36.740 --> 00:54:37.641 align:middle line:90%
override them.

00:54:37.641 --> 00:54:38.942 align:middle line:90%
>> Josh: For the most part.

00:54:38.942 --> 00:54:40.911 align:middle line:84%
There are some cities who
are taking the further step

00:54:40.911 --> 00:54:43.947 align:middle line:84%
to actually charge -- for
example, Sebastopol, California,

00:54:43.947 --> 00:54:46.283 align:middle line:84%
passed a motion earlier
this year to charge $500

00:54:46.283 --> 00:54:49.586 align:middle line:84%
for every single meter that
PG&E attempts to install.

00:54:49.586 --> 00:54:53.590 align:middle line:84%
Now, there's kind of a standoff
going on there right now.

00:54:53.590 --> 00:54:56.293 align:middle line:84%
So it's really up to
the people to follow

00:54:56.293 --> 00:54:59.830 align:middle line:84%
up with their city councils and
hold their feet to the fire,

00:54:59.830 --> 00:55:01.598 align:middle line:90%
because they are responsible,

00:55:01.598 --> 00:55:03.767 align:middle line:84%
even if they already
passed a moratorium,

00:55:03.767 --> 00:55:07.404 align:middle line:84%
which more than 50 local
governments in California and 50

00:55:07.404 --> 00:55:11.374 align:middle line:84%
in British Columbia, Canada, and
various other places have done.

00:55:11.374 --> 00:55:15.045 align:middle line:84%
They've taken an official stance
against the smart meter rollout.

00:55:15.045 --> 00:55:21.785 align:middle line:84%
We need to just really
amp up the level of action

00:55:21.785 --> 00:55:28.825 align:middle line:84%
and the level of commitment
which we have as the citizens,

00:55:28.825 --> 00:55:33.363 align:middle line:84%
as groups, and local
governments have in this issue.

00:55:33.363 --> 00:55:34.998 align:middle line:84%
>> Regina: Well, this
is a global agenda.

00:55:34.998 --> 00:55:38.568 align:middle line:84%
This is intended to be
a global smart grid.

00:55:38.568 --> 00:55:39.402 align:middle line:90%
Right?

00:55:39.402 --> 00:55:40.604 align:middle line:90%
>> Josh: Yeah, it's happening.

00:55:40.604 --> 00:55:43.006 align:middle line:84%
It's getting around the
existing laws everywhere,

00:55:43.006 --> 00:55:46.543 align:middle line:84%
and laws are being changed
silently, back door kind

00:55:46.543 --> 00:55:48.578 align:middle line:90%
of thing, without public input.

00:55:48.578 --> 00:55:52.682 align:middle line:84%
So it's not being talked
about in public, and if it is,

00:55:52.682 --> 00:55:55.652 align:middle line:84%
only part of the issue
is being talked about,

00:55:55.652 --> 00:55:57.554 align:middle line:90%
for example, health.

00:55:57.554 --> 00:56:00.557 align:middle line:84%
And because we're so programmed
-- this is the paradox --

00:56:00.557 --> 00:56:03.326 align:middle line:84%
the health issue is very, very
serious with the proliferation

00:56:03.326 --> 00:56:06.429 align:middle line:84%
of electromagnetic radiation,
dirty electricity, specifically

00:56:06.429 --> 00:56:08.565 align:middle line:84%
to do with smart meters
and the smart grid.

00:56:08.565 --> 00:56:11.168 align:middle line:84%
The paradox is that even though
that's potentially the most

00:56:11.168 --> 00:56:13.203 align:middle line:84%
serious issue, potentially
even more serious

00:56:13.203 --> 00:56:16.840 align:middle line:84%
than the in-home surveillance,
we've been so programmed

00:56:16.840 --> 00:56:19.242 align:middle line:84%
by the lies and by
the skewed science

00:56:19.242 --> 00:56:23.513 align:middle line:84%
and by our social
engineering to believe that all

00:56:23.513 --> 00:56:25.382 align:middle line:84%
of this wireless
technology and towers

00:56:25.382 --> 00:56:28.118 align:middle line:84%
and all this stuff is safe,
because if it wasn't safe,

00:56:28.118 --> 00:56:29.352 align:middle line:84%
they wouldn't be
allowed to do it.

00:56:29.352 --> 00:56:31.087 align:middle line:84%
>> Regina: Like there's
some oversight now.

00:56:31.087 --> 00:56:32.055 align:middle line:84%
>> Josh: Like there's
some oversight.

00:56:32.055 --> 00:56:33.089 align:middle line:90%
That's been removed.

00:56:33.089 --> 00:56:35.492 align:middle line:84%
>> Regina: We have
one final film clip.

00:56:35.492 --> 00:56:37.694 align:middle line:90%
We only have a few minutes left.

00:56:37.694 --> 00:56:39.763 align:middle line:84%
I'd like to take a look
at, because it's Jerry Day,

00:56:39.763 --> 00:56:42.432 align:middle line:84%
who I've interviewed
as well, and he talks

00:56:42.432 --> 00:56:44.367 align:middle line:84%
about the proactive
things you can do.

00:56:44.367 --> 00:56:46.937 align:middle line:84%
Actually we took our smart meter
off after interviewing Jerry

00:56:46.937 --> 00:56:49.439 align:middle line:84%
and finding out what we
were capable of doing,

00:56:49.439 --> 00:56:51.074 align:middle line:90%
because this is not a mandate.

00:56:51.074 --> 00:56:53.343 align:middle line:84%
We do not have to
submit to this.

00:56:53.343 --> 00:56:56.179 align:middle line:84%
So let's watch this
film clip with Jerry.

00:56:56.179 --> 00:56:59.115 align:middle line:84%
>> If you send them a notice
that says "I do not consent,

00:56:59.115 --> 00:57:03.620 align:middle line:84%
and if you attempt to put
one of these on my house,

00:57:03.620 --> 00:57:07.290 align:middle line:84%
I will put an analog
meter in self defense."

00:57:07.290 --> 00:57:09.893 align:middle line:84%
>> What about if thousands and
tens of thousands and millions

00:57:09.893 --> 00:57:10.894 align:middle line:90%
of people all did this?

00:57:10.894 --> 00:57:12.662 align:middle line:84%
>> Oh, it would collapse
in a day.

00:57:12.662 --> 00:57:17.067 align:middle line:84%
You can't have radiation
emitting surveillance devices

00:57:17.067 --> 00:57:21.905 align:middle line:84%
on everyone's home if people
want to assert their rights.

00:57:21.905 --> 00:57:25.909 align:middle line:84%
The only reason this
is working at all is

00:57:25.909 --> 00:57:29.079 align:middle line:84%
because people are e3ither
completely ignorant or thinking

00:57:29.079 --> 00:57:31.081 align:middle line:84%
for some reason, it's
not going to harm them.

00:57:31.081 --> 00:57:34.684 align:middle line:84%
It is going to harm you
and it is not legal,

00:57:34.684 --> 00:57:38.688 align:middle line:84%
and you now are forced because
your power company is pretending

00:57:38.688 --> 00:57:39.789 align:middle line:90%
like it's all okay --

00:57:39.789 --> 00:57:42.125 align:middle line:84%
you're forced to become
the authorized party

00:57:42.125 --> 00:57:43.827 align:middle line:90%
and to become the enforcer.

00:57:43.827 --> 00:57:47.297 align:middle line:84%
You have no choice, other
than to accept this harm.

00:57:47.297 --> 00:57:50.000 align:middle line:84%
So we're in a very
strange time in history

00:57:50.000 --> 00:57:51.735 align:middle line:84%
where your power
company, that's supposed

00:57:51.735 --> 00:57:54.638 align:middle line:84%
to be this innocent provider
of electrical service,

00:57:54.638 --> 00:57:58.942 align:middle line:84%
has become your assailant,
and you are required,

00:57:58.942 --> 00:58:03.913 align:middle line:84%
in order to protect yourself,
you're required to fight back.

00:58:03.913 --> 00:58:07.651 align:middle line:84%
You're required to stand up
and say no, this is wrong,

00:58:07.651 --> 00:58:10.654 align:middle line:90%
and I'm not going to permit it.

00:58:13.023 --> 00:58:15.925 align:middle line:84%
>> Regina: So finally -- we only
have a couple of minutes, Josh.

00:58:15.925 --> 00:58:23.300 align:middle line:84%
You like to talk about something
called our unalienable rights.

00:58:23.300 --> 00:58:25.335 align:middle line:84%
>> Josh: Unalienable
rights are something

00:58:25.335 --> 00:58:28.705 align:middle line:84%
that every human being has,
every man and woman has this.

00:58:28.705 --> 00:58:33.310 align:middle line:84%
We're not granted the rights
by governments and corporations

00:58:33.310 --> 00:58:37.147 align:middle line:84%
and this control system
that's happening right now.

00:58:37.147 --> 00:58:43.119 align:middle line:84%
So it's accessing that level,
that jurisdiction that appears

00:58:43.119 --> 00:58:45.922 align:middle line:84%
to be the most fruitful
in this whole movement,

00:58:45.922 --> 00:58:47.324 align:middle line:90%
in this whole campaign.

00:58:47.324 --> 00:58:50.427 align:middle line:84%
What we're seeing with lawsuits,
class action lawsuits, and very,

00:58:50.427 --> 00:58:53.330 align:middle line:84%
very well-meaning people and
groups that are going to lawyers

00:58:53.330 --> 00:58:55.865 align:middle line:84%
to represent them and
to represent this issue,

00:58:55.865 --> 00:58:58.335 align:middle line:84%
we're seeing a lot
of times, judges,

00:58:58.335 --> 00:59:02.439 align:middle line:84%
initially have strong
concerns about this.

00:59:02.439 --> 00:59:05.642 align:middle line:84%
They'll want to do something
about it, and they'll want

00:59:05.642 --> 00:59:08.078 align:middle line:84%
to help the people, but for
whatever reason we haven't seen

00:59:08.078 --> 00:59:12.349 align:middle line:84%
a major ruling on the side
of the people's rights,

00:59:12.349 --> 00:59:14.417 align:middle line:84%
even though there's
been all these lawsuits

00:59:14.417 --> 00:59:18.388 align:middle line:84%
and different sort of in
the box legal actions.

00:59:18.388 --> 00:59:21.057 align:middle line:84%
So I don't know if
that would be improved

00:59:21.057 --> 00:59:23.026 align:middle line:90%
if there was a jury of peers.

00:59:23.026 --> 00:59:25.028 align:middle line:90%
It probably would be improved,

00:59:25.028 --> 00:59:28.565 align:middle line:84%
rather than an administrative
judge just making that call.

00:59:28.565 --> 00:59:30.066 align:middle line:90%
But we've got to be realistic.

00:59:30.066 --> 00:59:32.569 align:middle line:84%
We're going up against a
multi-trillion dollar industry

00:59:32.569 --> 00:59:36.239 align:middle line:84%
here, so it's only accessing
that higher level of awareness

00:59:36.239 --> 00:59:39.142 align:middle line:84%
of consciousness of who
we are and our rights

00:59:39.142 --> 00:59:41.745 align:middle line:84%
as sovereign divine
beings and as souls,

00:59:41.745 --> 00:59:46.049 align:middle line:84%
creators on this planet, that
the solutions are happening.

00:59:46.049 --> 00:59:49.185 align:middle line:84%
And we're seeing that with
things like in contract law,

00:59:49.185 --> 00:59:53.256 align:middle line:84%
our ability to create agreement
based upon principles and facts

00:59:53.256 --> 00:59:55.759 align:middle line:84%
of truth with the other
party, in this case,

00:59:55.759 --> 00:59:58.695 align:middle line:84%
the utilities, are
being effective.

00:59:58.695 --> 01:00:00.029 align:middle line:90%
I just want to mention,

01:00:00.029 --> 01:00:02.732 align:middle line:84%
on behalf of this movement
everywhere globally there's a

01:00:02.732 --> 01:00:06.536 align:middle line:84%
group in British Columbia
called BC Freedom.

01:00:06.536 --> 01:00:10.607 align:middle line:90%
Their website is BC-Freedom.com.

01:00:10.607 --> 01:00:14.844 align:middle line:84%
They recently released the
second stage of their legal

01:00:14.844 --> 01:00:18.882 align:middle line:84%
and lawful process in which
it's allowing the 60 or thousand

01:00:18.882 --> 01:00:22.352 align:middle line:84%
so people who have chosen not
to have a smart meter so far,

01:00:22.352 --> 01:00:26.156 align:middle line:84%
it's allowing them to not have
to pay these extortive opt

01:00:26.156 --> 01:00:28.892 align:middle line:84%
out fees because it's allowing
them to come from a place

01:00:28.892 --> 01:00:31.494 align:middle line:84%
of truth and from a place
of higher jurisdiction.

01:00:31.494 --> 01:00:32.829 align:middle line:84%
>> Regina: So those
are going to end?

01:00:32.829 --> 01:00:35.965 align:middle line:84%
I mean, like we pay $10 a
month so they can manually come

01:00:35.965 --> 01:00:37.167 align:middle line:90%
and read the meter again.

01:00:37.167 --> 01:00:38.535 align:middle line:90%
>> Josh: Right.

01:00:38.535 --> 01:00:41.738 align:middle line:84%
That's an extortive opt-out
fee, and that's a punitive fee

01:00:41.738 --> 01:00:44.574 align:middle line:84%
and it's based on your
exercising your right not

01:00:44.574 --> 01:00:47.377 align:middle line:84%
to be surveilled and
not to be eradicated.

01:00:47.377 --> 01:00:48.678 align:middle line:90%
So this is extortion.

01:00:48.678 --> 01:00:51.581 align:middle line:84%
It's criminal mafia
extortion that's happening,

01:00:51.581 --> 01:00:55.185 align:middle line:84%
and this process, this
contract law process is now,

01:00:55.185 --> 01:00:58.788 align:middle line:84%
which have been proven 100%
effective in this group,

01:00:58.788 --> 01:01:01.825 align:middle line:84%
in British Columbia's
first documentation.

01:01:01.825 --> 01:01:03.726 align:middle line:84%
Their second documentation
is just released,

01:01:03.726 --> 01:01:06.629 align:middle line:84%
and so as the agenda
gets being pushed,

01:01:06.629 --> 01:01:08.031 align:middle line:90%
we're getting more solutions.

01:01:08.031 --> 01:01:11.901 align:middle line:84%
People are encouraged to stand
up, and I feel, and there's many

01:01:11.901 --> 01:01:16.172 align:middle line:84%
that are involved in this
issue, that know for sure

01:01:16.172 --> 01:01:17.707 align:middle line:90%
as people take back their power,

01:01:17.707 --> 01:01:19.309 align:middle line:84%
we're going to be
victorious in this.

01:01:19.309 --> 01:01:22.579 align:middle line:84%
>> Regina: Absolutely, claim our
own sovereign right to health,

01:01:22.579 --> 01:01:24.347 align:middle line:90%
well-being and privacy.

01:01:24.347 --> 01:01:26.082 align:middle line:84%
And I know you don't
want to be a poster boy

01:01:26.082 --> 01:01:28.117 align:middle line:84%
and you're a very modest
man, but thank you so much

01:01:28.117 --> 01:01:31.054 align:middle line:84%
for taking this one on, for
picking up the gauntlet.

01:01:31.054 --> 01:01:32.055 align:middle line:90%
>> Josh: Thank you.

01:01:32.055 --> 01:01:33.523 align:middle line:84%
>> Regina: This is
a film everyone

01:01:33.523 --> 01:01:35.325 align:middle line:90%
who uses energy needs to see.

01:01:35.325 --> 01:01:37.961 align:middle line:84%
You can stream it, you can
buy the DVD, watch it alone

01:01:37.961 --> 01:01:40.763 align:middle line:84%
or get people together, but
this is a starting point

01:01:40.763 --> 01:01:44.634 align:middle line:84%
in my opinion, to take back
our power on all levels.

01:01:44.634 --> 01:01:47.270 align:middle line:84%
You can go to
Takebackyourpower.net

01:01:47.270 --> 01:01:48.638 align:middle line:90%
to become more informed.

01:01:48.638 --> 01:02:10.627 align:middle line:84%
Until next time, thank you for
joining us here on Gaiam-TV.
