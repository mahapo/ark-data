00:00:30.307 --> 00:00:32.390 align:middle line:10%
>>REGINA MEREDITH: Not to
embarrass today's guest,

00:00:32.390 --> 00:00:34.320 align:middle line:10%
but every now and
then, we meet someone

00:00:34.320 --> 00:00:37.180 align:middle line:10%
who is so incredibly
clean and clear in the way

00:00:37.180 --> 00:00:39.400 align:middle line:10%
they show up in the world
that they stand out.

00:00:39.400 --> 00:00:42.080 align:middle line:84%
That's how I experience
Lee Harris, whom we've

00:00:42.080 --> 00:00:43.600 align:middle line:90%
had on "Open Minds" before.

00:00:43.600 --> 00:00:46.320 align:middle line:84%
I've invited him back due to
the clarity of information

00:00:46.320 --> 00:00:49.170 align:middle line:84%
that the group he channels,
the Z's, bring us.

00:00:49.170 --> 00:00:52.020 align:middle line:84%
Today, we'll talk with them
about each one of us connecting

00:00:52.020 --> 00:00:55.080 align:middle line:84%
to our own internal guidance,
which is heavily loaded

00:00:55.080 --> 00:00:58.360 align:middle line:84%
because it gets into our
history of what makes us up

00:00:58.360 --> 00:01:00.975 align:middle line:84%
that we would even need
to do this to begin with.

00:01:00.975 --> 00:01:02.140 align:middle line:90%
And welcome back.

00:01:02.140 --> 00:01:03.560 align:middle line:90%
It's so good to see you again.

00:01:03.560 --> 00:01:03.850 align:middle line:90%
>>LEE HARRIS: Thank you.

00:01:03.850 --> 00:01:04.835 align:middle line:90%
It's great to be back.

00:01:04.835 --> 00:01:06.210 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And you
know what, Lee?

00:01:06.210 --> 00:01:10.990 align:middle line:84%
Before we get going with
the Z's in a little bit,

00:01:10.990 --> 00:01:12.430 align:middle line:90%
how does your life feel now?

00:01:12.430 --> 00:01:14.090 align:middle line:84%
How do you experience
it now compared

00:01:14.090 --> 00:01:16.260 align:middle line:84%
to before you
connected with them

00:01:16.260 --> 00:01:19.160 align:middle line:90%
and were using direct guidance?

00:01:19.160 --> 00:01:22.130 align:middle line:10%
>>HARRIS: Far less pain
and fear internally,

00:01:22.130 --> 00:01:24.900 align:middle line:10%
so there was a lot more
confusion and a lot more

00:01:24.900 --> 00:01:26.620 align:middle line:10%
emotional overwhelm.

00:01:26.620 --> 00:01:29.360 align:middle line:84%
I think the personal gift
for me with the channel

00:01:29.360 --> 00:01:31.530 align:middle line:84%
was learning about
my sensitivity.

00:01:31.530 --> 00:01:35.130 align:middle line:84%
So talking to them, asking
them personal questions,

00:01:35.130 --> 00:01:37.950 align:middle line:84%
and understanding their
worldview just helped me find

00:01:37.950 --> 00:01:41.150 align:middle line:84%
what I call the 'space inside',
so rather than the kind

00:01:41.150 --> 00:01:43.580 align:middle line:84%
of the mental [STATIC NOISE]
that you can have running

00:01:43.580 --> 00:01:46.450 align:middle line:84%
or the emotional impacts that
you can have with each other

00:01:46.450 --> 00:01:49.840 align:middle line:84%
when there's chaos or
drama in a relationship,

00:01:49.840 --> 00:01:52.430 align:middle line:84%
an ability to keep coming
back to the 'space inside'.

00:01:52.430 --> 00:01:55.920 align:middle line:84%
So that's kind of really
the biggest impact for me.

00:01:55.920 --> 00:01:56.920 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Which is huge.

00:01:56.920 --> 00:01:57.795 align:middle line:90%
>>HARRIS: It is huge.

00:01:57.795 --> 00:02:00.264 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: The diminishing of
pain in the human experience.

00:02:00.264 --> 00:02:00.930 align:middle line:90%
>>HARRIS: It is.

00:02:00.930 --> 00:02:04.710 align:middle line:84%
And my experience, if I
try and think back to 22,

00:02:04.710 --> 00:02:08.720 align:middle line:84%
so 16 years ago, I felt much
more horizontally bombarded

00:02:08.720 --> 00:02:11.630 align:middle line:84%
in the world and much more
horizontally in response

00:02:11.630 --> 00:02:14.350 align:middle line:84%
to everything
going on outside me

00:02:14.350 --> 00:02:18.170 align:middle line:84%
horizontally in
relationships or in something

00:02:18.170 --> 00:02:19.470 align:middle line:90%
I was working on or in.

00:02:19.470 --> 00:02:22.040 align:middle line:84%
And now it's very
easy for me to notice

00:02:22.040 --> 00:02:25.240 align:middle line:84%
an imbalance in that area
and just come back inside.

00:02:25.240 --> 00:02:27.890 align:middle line:84%
And when I come back
inside, you also can go up.

00:02:27.890 --> 00:02:30.470 align:middle line:84%
So you kind of maintain
what I call your vertical.

00:02:30.470 --> 00:02:34.330 align:middle line:84%
So my experience is our vertical
is our divine connection,

00:02:34.330 --> 00:02:37.470 align:middle line:84%
and our horizontal is our
earthly relationships,

00:02:37.470 --> 00:02:38.740 align:middle line:90%
planet Earth connection.

00:02:38.740 --> 00:02:41.810 align:middle line:84%
Both meeting at a
balance point is perfect.

00:02:41.810 --> 00:02:45.820 align:middle line:84%
But often, most people are
trained to just be horizontal.

00:02:45.820 --> 00:02:48.860 align:middle line:84%
And vice versa, some people
have such a traumatic experience

00:02:48.860 --> 00:02:51.970 align:middle line:84%
in the horizontal, they
disappear into their vertical

00:02:51.970 --> 00:02:54.810 align:middle line:84%
and don't want to come back
from meditation or spirituality.

00:02:54.810 --> 00:02:56.710 align:middle line:84%
And yet my experience
of witnessing

00:02:56.710 --> 00:02:59.130 align:middle line:84%
people and the people
I've seen that I've

00:02:59.130 --> 00:03:02.045 align:middle line:84%
worked with in my own
life, the balance point

00:03:02.045 --> 00:03:03.950 align:middle line:84%
is really where
the good stuff is.

00:03:03.950 --> 00:03:05.150 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes, absolutely.

00:03:05.150 --> 00:03:08.460 align:middle line:84%
And I love this
particular subject

00:03:08.460 --> 00:03:10.780 align:middle line:84%
we'll be discussing
today, because it

00:03:10.780 --> 00:03:15.680 align:middle line:84%
is a lost aspect of what is
and should be our birthright.

00:03:15.680 --> 00:03:19.490 align:middle line:84%
And not to preempt
the Z's at all--

00:03:19.490 --> 00:03:22.737 align:middle line:84%
and by the way, for anybody who
didn't see the first interview,

00:03:22.737 --> 00:03:24.320 align:middle line:84%
you need to go watch
that just so they

00:03:24.320 --> 00:03:26.520 align:middle line:84%
can learn more about you
and how this originally

00:03:26.520 --> 00:03:27.450 align:middle line:90%
happened with you.

00:03:27.450 --> 00:03:31.600 align:middle line:84%
There's no point in going over
this territory again, but maybe

00:03:31.600 --> 00:03:38.670 align:middle line:84%
just an idea of how the Z's
feel about humanity and not just

00:03:38.670 --> 00:03:41.060 align:middle line:84%
our need to start hooking
up with our own higher

00:03:41.060 --> 00:03:44.030 align:middle line:84%
intelligence, but the
absolute imperative of it

00:03:44.030 --> 00:03:46.020 align:middle line:90%
in these times.

00:03:46.020 --> 00:03:47.610 align:middle line:84%
>>HARRIS: The
thing that I really

00:03:47.610 --> 00:03:51.230 align:middle line:84%
enjoy about them is they
have an incredible patience.

00:03:51.230 --> 00:03:54.870 align:middle line:84%
And I expose myself to
different spiritual teachings

00:03:54.870 --> 00:03:56.870 align:middle line:84%
and teachers over the
years, and I didn't always

00:03:56.870 --> 00:03:58.400 align:middle line:90%
find that patience was present.

00:03:58.400 --> 00:04:01.010 align:middle line:84%
Sometimes people were
aggressively pushing you

00:04:01.010 --> 00:04:04.700 align:middle line:84%
or trying to get you to become
something that they thought you

00:04:04.700 --> 00:04:05.260 align:middle line:90%
weren't,

00:04:05.260 --> 00:04:09.340 align:middle line:84%
And even within all
of what I've really

00:04:09.340 --> 00:04:11.800 align:middle line:84%
seen with the Z's on a personal
level, but also working

00:04:11.800 --> 00:04:15.670 align:middle line:84%
for others, so doing broadcasts
with 400 people and asking

00:04:15.670 --> 00:04:19.029 align:middle line:84%
questions, there's always
a core of patience.

00:04:19.029 --> 00:04:21.279 align:middle line:84%
And I've seen how that
patience is actually

00:04:21.279 --> 00:04:23.650 align:middle line:84%
what allows us to
become what we need

00:04:23.650 --> 00:04:25.450 align:middle line:90%
to becomes as the next step.

00:04:25.450 --> 00:04:32.130 align:middle line:84%
So they seem to hold a very
consistent patient flag for us

00:04:32.130 --> 00:04:35.750 align:middle line:84%
to become more sensory,
more aware, more intuitive.

00:04:35.750 --> 00:04:38.370 align:middle line:84%
But they're not asking us to
get rid of everything else.

00:04:38.370 --> 00:04:41.380 align:middle line:84%
They're kind of coming
at it from an angle of,

00:04:41.380 --> 00:04:42.340 align:middle line:90%
you already have this.

00:04:42.340 --> 00:04:43.800 align:middle line:90%
You already are human in form.

00:04:43.800 --> 00:04:45.380 align:middle line:90%
You already know these things.

00:04:45.380 --> 00:04:47.450 align:middle line:84%
Now just introduce these
and keep bringing them

00:04:47.450 --> 00:04:48.520 align:middle line:90%
into your awareness.

00:04:48.520 --> 00:04:50.680 align:middle line:84%
And one of the quotes
that they often repeat

00:04:50.680 --> 00:04:53.080 align:middle line:84%
is, "awareness is the
precursor to change."

00:04:53.080 --> 00:04:53.980 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Absolutely.

00:04:53.980 --> 00:04:57.090 align:middle line:84%
>>HARRIS: So if you can
become aware of something

00:04:57.090 --> 00:04:59.360 align:middle line:84%
in your life, the
common tendency

00:04:59.360 --> 00:05:00.627 align:middle line:90%
is to then beat yourself up.

00:05:00.627 --> 00:05:02.960 align:middle line:84%
It's like, oh, no, I'm aware
that I'm sabotaging myself.

00:05:02.960 --> 00:05:04.760 align:middle line:84%
And most people don't
step out of that.

00:05:04.760 --> 00:05:05.850 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: That
thought would not even

00:05:05.850 --> 00:05:07.500 align:middle line:84%
have occurred if
you weren't aware.

00:05:07.500 --> 00:05:08.250 align:middle line:90%
>>HARRIS: Exactly.

00:05:08.250 --> 00:05:11.390 align:middle line:84%
So it's often, I notice,
they, or in the work

00:05:11.390 --> 00:05:14.620 align:middle line:84%
that I do around
the channeling, I'm

00:05:14.620 --> 00:05:17.320 align:middle line:84%
often working with people on
some of the human syndromes

00:05:17.320 --> 00:05:20.140 align:middle line:84%
that we have,
self-judgment, low esteem,

00:05:20.140 --> 00:05:22.560 align:middle line:84%
a belief that you
don't have an innate

00:05:22.560 --> 00:05:25.782 align:middle line:84%
divine force and
power inside you.

00:05:25.782 --> 00:05:27.365 align:middle line:84%
And there's a
cleanliness around that.

00:05:27.365 --> 00:05:30.260 align:middle line:84%
It doesn't have to be
something that takes power

00:05:30.260 --> 00:05:32.540 align:middle line:84%
over others in any negative
or controlling way,

00:05:32.540 --> 00:05:34.010 align:middle line:90%
quite the opposite.

00:05:34.010 --> 00:05:36.690 align:middle line:84%
But then what I notice they
seem to do with the channel

00:05:36.690 --> 00:05:39.540 align:middle line:84%
and the effect of them is
they seem to drill right

00:05:39.540 --> 00:05:44.070 align:middle line:84%
into the middle of people, and
often what people will speak

00:05:44.070 --> 00:05:47.320 align:middle line:84%
about is the energetic
effect that they take away,

00:05:47.320 --> 00:05:49.737 align:middle line:84%
They'll often say, I can't
remember what they were saying.

00:05:49.737 --> 00:05:51.153 align:middle line:84%
I can't remember
any of the words.

00:05:51.153 --> 00:05:53.030 align:middle line:84%
And they always say,
well, the words are just

00:05:53.030 --> 00:05:54.154 align:middle line:90%
the carrier for the energy.

00:05:54.154 --> 00:05:56.770 align:middle line:84%
And we know that you need
the words to stay on track,

00:05:56.770 --> 00:05:59.960 align:middle line:84%
and that's how some of you can
access us through the mind.

00:05:59.960 --> 00:06:02.584 align:middle line:84%
But unlike when I'm speaking
as an energy intuitive,

00:06:02.584 --> 00:06:04.500 align:middle line:84%
I notice with the
channeling, I'll often hear,

00:06:04.500 --> 00:06:06.160 align:middle line:84%
I don't remember
anything they said,

00:06:06.160 --> 00:06:08.060 align:middle line:90%
but I feel really different.

00:06:08.060 --> 00:06:11.980 align:middle line:84%
So in a weird way to me,
that is kind of the testament

00:06:11.980 --> 00:06:13.440 align:middle line:90%
to energy work.

00:06:13.440 --> 00:06:16.520 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Yes, I understand
that, because before each show,

00:06:16.520 --> 00:06:18.520 align:middle line:84%
I always take a couple
breaths off camera

00:06:18.520 --> 00:06:20.510 align:middle line:90%
before we start rolling.

00:06:20.510 --> 00:06:22.160 align:middle line:84%
And each time what
I'm doing is just

00:06:22.160 --> 00:06:24.230 align:middle line:84%
kind of checking in to
see what's in the room,

00:06:24.230 --> 00:06:27.210 align:middle line:84%
what kind of energy, what
kind of beings might be here.

00:06:27.210 --> 00:06:31.100 align:middle line:84%
And the notion of not
remembering anything,

00:06:31.100 --> 00:06:33.370 align:middle line:84%
I probably won't remember
anything today either,

00:06:33.370 --> 00:06:36.820 align:middle line:84%
because the energy
is so profound

00:06:36.820 --> 00:06:40.320 align:middle line:84%
and almost-- I don't mean
overwhelming in a negative way.

00:06:40.320 --> 00:06:44.760 align:middle line:84%
It's embracing, that I told you
a little bit ago that I risk

00:06:44.760 --> 00:06:47.370 align:middle line:84%
going into kind
of a trance myself

00:06:47.370 --> 00:06:51.284 align:middle line:84%
just by association having them
in this tight quarters with me.

00:06:51.284 --> 00:06:52.700 align:middle line:84%
>>HARRIS: And it's
similar for me.

00:06:52.700 --> 00:06:54.200 align:middle line:84%
Even knowing what
we're about to do,

00:06:54.200 --> 00:06:57.046 align:middle line:84%
I can feel I'm having to work
to bring my body back down.

00:06:57.046 --> 00:06:58.580 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Exactly.

00:06:58.580 --> 00:07:00.100 align:middle line:84%
>>HARRIS: Yeah, so
it's interesting.

00:07:00.100 --> 00:07:04.550 align:middle line:84%
And I think that's the gift of
channeling, in my experience.

00:07:04.550 --> 00:07:08.040 align:middle line:84%
The gift of channeling is it's
almost a window in which we

00:07:08.040 --> 00:07:10.100 align:middle line:84%
can all access those
energy realms that

00:07:10.100 --> 00:07:11.210 align:middle line:90%
are outside our body.

00:07:11.210 --> 00:07:13.210 align:middle line:84%
And my belief is
that the benefit

00:07:13.210 --> 00:07:15.545 align:middle line:84%
of channeling and
exposing yourself to it

00:07:15.545 --> 00:07:17.670 align:middle line:84%
is that through exposing
yourself to those energies

00:07:17.670 --> 00:07:20.030 align:middle line:84%
through a channeler
or an energy worker,

00:07:20.030 --> 00:07:23.270 align:middle line:84%
you have the ability to
remember that space in yourself

00:07:23.270 --> 00:07:25.975 align:middle line:84%
and open to it just a little
more, however much is--

00:07:25.975 --> 00:07:27.850 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Yeah, once
you feel it, it's there.

00:07:27.850 --> 00:07:28.850 align:middle line:90%
It's been activated.

00:07:28.850 --> 00:07:29.810 align:middle line:90%
>>HARRIS: Absolutely.

00:07:29.810 --> 00:07:31.780 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And so I can
see why people say,

00:07:31.780 --> 00:07:33.460 align:middle line:84%
the gift is I
remember the feeling.

00:07:33.460 --> 00:07:35.760 align:middle line:84%
Because embedded in
the feeling, there

00:07:35.760 --> 00:07:38.300 align:middle line:84%
is information that
went in with it.

00:07:38.300 --> 00:07:41.220 align:middle line:84%
It's living
alongside the energy.

00:07:41.220 --> 00:07:45.150 align:middle line:84%
So eventually, it does
percolate up to consciousness.

00:07:45.150 --> 00:07:46.820 align:middle line:84%
Well, in a lot of
cases, anyway, it'll

00:07:46.820 --> 00:07:48.630 align:middle line:84%
percolate up to
consciousness at some point

00:07:48.630 --> 00:07:50.327 align:middle line:84%
when the person's
ready to act on it.

00:07:50.327 --> 00:07:52.910 align:middle line:84%
>>HARRIS: And if you think about
that on the horizontal level,

00:07:52.910 --> 00:07:54.076 align:middle line:90%
the same thing is happening.

00:07:54.076 --> 00:07:56.777 align:middle line:84%
So how often do you have a
conversation with someone,

00:07:56.777 --> 00:07:59.360 align:middle line:84%
and they're speaking to you in
a certain way, and you're like,

00:07:59.360 --> 00:07:59.870 align:middle line:90%
how are you?

00:07:59.870 --> 00:08:01.450 align:middle line:84%
And they're like, I'm
doing really well.

00:08:01.450 --> 00:08:02.090 align:middle line:90%
Thanks, Regina.

00:08:02.090 --> 00:08:03.450 align:middle line:90%
I'm really excited about life.

00:08:03.450 --> 00:08:04.960 align:middle line:90%
And you're like, you're not.

00:08:04.960 --> 00:08:07.180 align:middle line:84%
Your energy's
completely different.

00:08:07.180 --> 00:08:08.090 align:middle line:90%
And you see that.

00:08:08.090 --> 00:08:10.670 align:middle line:84%
I mean, I did a crass example
to try and illustrate it,

00:08:10.670 --> 00:08:13.130 align:middle line:84%
but you see that in
subtleties all of the time.

00:08:13.130 --> 00:08:15.410 align:middle line:84%
People's energies
are communicating,

00:08:15.410 --> 00:08:17.180 align:middle line:90%
and we don't have enough words.

00:08:17.180 --> 00:08:18.260 align:middle line:90%
And what a relief.

00:08:18.260 --> 00:08:19.635 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And we
don't take time,

00:08:19.635 --> 00:08:20.930 align:middle line:90%
because we're in such a hurry.

00:08:20.930 --> 00:08:25.900 align:middle line:84%
We don't take time and say, hmm,
you're feeling well, are you?

00:08:25.900 --> 00:08:28.620 align:middle line:84%
I'm sensing a little
something else going on.

00:08:28.620 --> 00:08:31.650 align:middle line:84%
Because we're all in kind of a
hurry to get to our own point,

00:08:31.650 --> 00:08:33.580 align:middle line:84%
to get to the next
thing in life.

00:08:33.580 --> 00:08:36.780 align:middle line:90%
We're running past the obvious.

00:08:36.780 --> 00:08:38.280 align:middle line:84%
And we could be
really helping each

00:08:38.280 --> 00:08:41.299 align:middle line:84%
other just by kind of, I
think what you were just

00:08:41.299 --> 00:08:43.960 align:middle line:84%
talking about, calling each
other on it, like, really?

00:08:43.960 --> 00:08:45.765 align:middle line:90%
You don't feel like you're well.

00:08:45.765 --> 00:08:47.390 align:middle line:84%
>>HARRIS: And they're
the best friends,

00:08:47.390 --> 00:08:50.290 align:middle line:84%
like the people in my life who
will just point something out

00:08:50.290 --> 00:08:51.790 align:middle line:84%
to me if I haven't
seen it myself.

00:08:51.790 --> 00:08:52.750 align:middle line:90%
They're the best.

00:08:52.750 --> 00:08:53.405 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah, absolutely.

00:08:53.405 --> 00:08:56.080 align:middle line:84%
>>HARRIS: You're looking out for
each other's energetics as well

00:08:56.080 --> 00:08:58.370 align:middle line:84%
as each other's
minds and doings.

00:08:58.370 --> 00:08:59.260 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:08:59.260 --> 00:09:03.410 align:middle line:84%
Well, last time, of course,
I had a grand plan last time

00:09:03.410 --> 00:09:07.730 align:middle line:84%
we met, and you channeled the
Z's of all these lofty things I

00:09:07.730 --> 00:09:08.970 align:middle line:90%
was going to ask them about.

00:09:08.970 --> 00:09:11.590 align:middle line:84%
And then, boom, the conversation
took a completely different

00:09:11.590 --> 00:09:12.160 align:middle line:90%
turn.

00:09:12.160 --> 00:09:15.830 align:middle line:84%
So though I've suggested that
we'll look into the guidance

00:09:15.830 --> 00:09:17.470 align:middle line:84%
systems for humanity,
because we are

00:09:17.470 --> 00:09:21.880 align:middle line:84%
such a unique species of beings,
who knows what kind of ride

00:09:21.880 --> 00:09:23.970 align:middle line:84%
we're going to go on
with the Z's today?

00:09:23.970 --> 00:09:26.650 align:middle line:84%
But I can feel them here, and
as you said, you feel them,

00:09:26.650 --> 00:09:29.040 align:middle line:84%
and there's a lot of
activity, a lot of excitement

00:09:29.040 --> 00:09:30.200 align:middle line:90%
and all of that.

00:09:30.200 --> 00:09:33.970 align:middle line:84%
So rather than you fighting
to stay up above water, why

00:09:33.970 --> 00:09:36.510 align:middle line:84%
don't you just sink down
into that lovely zone,

00:09:36.510 --> 00:09:38.340 align:middle line:90%
and we'll begin a conversation.

00:09:38.340 --> 00:09:39.519 align:middle line:90%
>>HARRIS: Perfect, thanks.

00:09:39.519 --> 00:09:40.560 align:middle line:90%
I'll just drink some tea.

00:09:40.560 --> 00:09:42.226 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Sure, have
a cup of tea first.

00:09:42.226 --> 00:09:45.050 align:middle line:90%


00:09:45.050 --> 00:09:46.450 align:middle line:90%
OK, we're back.

00:09:46.450 --> 00:09:48.210 align:middle line:84%
And the Z's are
present, and we're

00:09:48.210 --> 00:09:52.300 align:middle line:84%
going to have a conversation,
wherever that may lead us.

00:09:52.300 --> 00:09:54.560 align:middle line:84%
Welcome, and thank
you for joining us.

00:09:54.560 --> 00:09:58.080 align:middle line:84%
>>HARRIS: Welcome, a pleasure
to be transmitting with you.

00:09:58.080 --> 00:09:59.060 align:middle line:90%
Ha.

00:09:59.060 --> 00:10:03.660 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Ha? [LAUGHS]
One of the things I wanted

00:10:03.660 --> 00:10:10.100 align:middle line:84%
to talk about is this kind
of anomalous structure

00:10:10.100 --> 00:10:13.820 align:middle line:84%
that human beings seem
to have, in this state

00:10:13.820 --> 00:10:17.600 align:middle line:84%
of amnesia on one level
we walk around in and yet

00:10:17.600 --> 00:10:21.190 align:middle line:84%
this ability to access such
heights within our being

00:10:21.190 --> 00:10:22.620 align:middle line:90%
if we're aware.

00:10:22.620 --> 00:10:27.720 align:middle line:84%
And I would like to start with
more of the origins of what

00:10:27.720 --> 00:10:30.410 align:middle line:84%
we are a bit, going
back into the time where

00:10:30.410 --> 00:10:33.630 align:middle line:84%
many people watching this
even were present in the times

00:10:33.630 --> 00:10:35.120 align:middle line:90%
that we call Lemuria.

00:10:35.120 --> 00:10:39.320 align:middle line:84%
What were our original
beings like energetically?

00:10:39.320 --> 00:10:40.740 align:middle line:90%
What were we capable of?

00:10:40.740 --> 00:10:43.080 align:middle line:84%
And if you can just
tell us a bit about how

00:10:43.080 --> 00:10:45.860 align:middle line:84%
we lived in the very
earliest times on Earth so

00:10:45.860 --> 00:10:49.200 align:middle line:84%
we can start getting a
portrait of what we are.

00:10:49.200 --> 00:10:51.150 align:middle line:84%
>>HARRIS: The reason
you are most interested

00:10:51.150 --> 00:10:52.890 align:middle line:84%
in this topic at
this time and you

00:10:52.890 --> 00:10:54.820 align:middle line:84%
and many other
seekers are looking

00:10:54.820 --> 00:10:57.910 align:middle line:84%
for information on this
topic is because you are all

00:10:57.910 --> 00:11:01.140 align:middle line:84%
re-accessing and feeling
the energies of those times.

00:11:01.140 --> 00:11:05.120 align:middle line:84%
Indeed, many of you are
reincarnate with high memory

00:11:05.120 --> 00:11:06.010 align:middle line:90%
of those times.

00:11:06.010 --> 00:11:08.890 align:middle line:84%
So for example,
let's say many of you

00:11:08.890 --> 00:11:12.970 align:middle line:84%
have had 11 lifetimes on Earth
since those potent energy

00:11:12.970 --> 00:11:15.980 align:middle line:84%
technology times, for
we refer to Lemuria,

00:11:15.980 --> 00:11:20.240 align:middle line:84%
and indeed Atlantis, as times
of high energy technology,

00:11:20.240 --> 00:11:24.560 align:middle line:84%
that period where humans,
for want of a better term,

00:11:24.560 --> 00:11:28.890 align:middle line:84%
were playing with the heights
and high capacity of energy

00:11:28.890 --> 00:11:30.420 align:middle line:90%
in the human form.

00:11:30.420 --> 00:11:34.340 align:middle line:84%
We understand that you do not
quite see it as human form

00:11:34.340 --> 00:11:37.700 align:middle line:84%
back then, but in
some ways, you are all

00:11:37.700 --> 00:11:40.690 align:middle line:84%
holding energy templates
that still exist.

00:11:40.690 --> 00:11:43.350 align:middle line:84%
So even if the bodies back then
were different to the bodies

00:11:43.350 --> 00:11:46.420 align:middle line:84%
now, there is an activation
of those energy templates

00:11:46.420 --> 00:11:49.580 align:middle line:84%
at this time on Earth that
many of you are playing with.

00:11:49.580 --> 00:11:53.930 align:middle line:84%
This relates to what you
would call unified genders.

00:11:53.930 --> 00:11:57.830 align:middle line:84%
So rather than male, female
in energy or in form,

00:11:57.830 --> 00:11:59.990 align:middle line:84%
there was unification
in Lemuria.

00:11:59.990 --> 00:12:02.900 align:middle line:84%
And then the separation
act began, and then

00:12:02.900 --> 00:12:05.320 align:middle line:84%
in the Atlantean
times, many of you

00:12:05.320 --> 00:12:07.930 align:middle line:84%
were, those of you who
remember this time,

00:12:07.930 --> 00:12:10.650 align:middle line:84%
and many of you even
hearing the word "Atlantis"

00:12:10.650 --> 00:12:13.975 align:middle line:84%
have a physical reaction, you
were the energy technologists

00:12:13.975 --> 00:12:15.560 align:middle line:90%
of your time.

00:12:15.560 --> 00:12:17.640 align:middle line:90%
You were conducting experiments.

00:12:17.640 --> 00:12:21.850 align:middle line:84%
But a little like those who are
too mind-led in your society

00:12:21.850 --> 00:12:25.550 align:middle line:84%
today, your fascination
for what was possible

00:12:25.550 --> 00:12:27.840 align:middle line:90%
denied what was needed.

00:12:27.840 --> 00:12:31.360 align:middle line:84%
So in many ways, the
whole thing exploded.

00:12:31.360 --> 00:12:33.940 align:middle line:84%
But it did not explode
in such a negative way

00:12:33.940 --> 00:12:35.240 align:middle line:90%
as is often viewed.

00:12:35.240 --> 00:12:37.340 align:middle line:84%
You will speak about
Atlantis sinking.

00:12:37.340 --> 00:12:40.090 align:middle line:84%
You will speak about the
terrible loss and tragedy.

00:12:40.090 --> 00:12:42.870 align:middle line:84%
But Atlantis was always
designed to sink.

00:12:42.870 --> 00:12:46.390 align:middle line:84%
And the stardust that it
leaves behind still to this day

00:12:46.390 --> 00:12:48.110 align:middle line:90%
ripples through your world.

00:12:48.110 --> 00:12:50.210 align:middle line:84%
And in this period,
that which many of you

00:12:50.210 --> 00:12:54.080 align:middle line:84%
like to refer to as the Golden
Age, that following 2012,

00:12:54.080 --> 00:12:56.870 align:middle line:84%
although in truth,
2012 began some

00:12:56.870 --> 00:12:59.880 align:middle line:84%
five years earlier in
terms of the Mayan calendar

00:12:59.880 --> 00:13:02.710 align:middle line:84%
prophecies, and the time
shift that took place

00:13:02.710 --> 00:13:06.660 align:middle line:84%
in linear time, many of
you right now this day,

00:13:06.660 --> 00:13:10.440 align:middle line:84%
as you listen to these words and
as you walk around your worlds,

00:13:10.440 --> 00:13:13.330 align:middle line:84%
you are aware that energy
technology is being invited

00:13:13.330 --> 00:13:15.440 align:middle line:84%
back into this
three-dimensional world

00:13:15.440 --> 00:13:16.980 align:middle line:90%
that you are living in now.

00:13:16.980 --> 00:13:21.160 align:middle line:84%
So many of you are not in the
three-dimensional reality.

00:13:21.160 --> 00:13:25.000 align:middle line:84%
You are hovering somewhere
between four and six,

00:13:25.000 --> 00:13:27.450 align:middle line:84%
and you are walking around
the world in such a way.

00:13:27.450 --> 00:13:30.020 align:middle line:84%
And so those that you
speak of, that you address

00:13:30.020 --> 00:13:34.370 align:middle line:84%
as having amnesia, they are not
the people listening to this,

00:13:34.370 --> 00:13:37.990 align:middle line:84%
and nor should they be judged
as lesser than because of.

00:13:37.990 --> 00:13:40.250 align:middle line:84%
It is simply the case
that there are many of you

00:13:40.250 --> 00:13:44.310 align:middle line:84%
on the planet who are already
activated by this Atlantean

00:13:44.310 --> 00:13:44.810 align:middle line:90%
energy.

00:13:44.810 --> 00:13:48.180 align:middle line:84%
And Lemuria was, in
many ways, the seed

00:13:48.180 --> 00:13:49.800 align:middle line:90%
for what Atlantis became.

00:13:49.800 --> 00:13:54.500 align:middle line:84%
So you could Lemuria as
the skeleton and Atlantis

00:13:54.500 --> 00:13:55.720 align:middle line:90%
as the flesh.

00:13:55.720 --> 00:13:59.090 align:middle line:84%
And in the unity of
those two, an energy bomb

00:13:59.090 --> 00:14:01.600 align:middle line:84%
was created that was
always designed to explode,

00:14:01.600 --> 00:14:03.700 align:middle line:84%
for it could not
sustain at that time,

00:14:03.700 --> 00:14:05.530 align:middle line:90%
and nor was it supposed to.

00:14:05.530 --> 00:14:09.300 align:middle line:84%
But the scatterings of
those pieces of energy

00:14:09.300 --> 00:14:11.310 align:middle line:84%
did not get lost
and instead were

00:14:11.310 --> 00:14:13.880 align:middle line:84%
carried throughout the
ages by those who could.

00:14:13.880 --> 00:14:15.610 align:middle line:84%
And now you come to
a time where there

00:14:15.610 --> 00:14:19.050 align:middle line:84%
is what you might refer
to as a mass remembering

00:14:19.050 --> 00:14:22.140 align:middle line:84%
and reactivation
of those energies.

00:14:22.140 --> 00:14:25.940 align:middle line:84%
And the attempt for humanity and
Earth at this time in its cycle

00:14:25.940 --> 00:14:30.870 align:middle line:84%
is to see, can it all return
at as high of level as possible

00:14:30.870 --> 00:14:34.120 align:middle line:84%
without exploding the
whole place again?

00:14:34.120 --> 00:14:35.869 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Can you
paint a picture for us?

00:14:35.869 --> 00:14:37.410 align:middle line:84%
When you say the
bodies were not what

00:14:37.410 --> 00:14:42.040 align:middle line:84%
we would now recognize as
bodies, how would you describe?

00:14:42.040 --> 00:14:44.760 align:middle line:84%
Give us maybe a
living picture of what

00:14:44.760 --> 00:14:47.750 align:middle line:84%
the bodies in the
Lemurian phase were like

00:14:47.750 --> 00:14:51.370 align:middle line:84%
and how the interaction
between people and societies

00:14:51.370 --> 00:14:53.090 align:middle line:90%
were at that time.

00:14:53.090 --> 00:14:54.670 align:middle line:84%
>>HARRIS: The bodies
in Lemurian time

00:14:54.670 --> 00:14:57.342 align:middle line:84%
were, for most of your
eyes, for all of you

00:14:57.342 --> 00:14:59.300 align:middle line:84%
see slightly differently,
and this is something

00:14:59.300 --> 00:15:03.830 align:middle line:84%
that humanity can forget-- you
can paint a picture through six

00:15:03.830 --> 00:15:05.300 align:middle line:84%
different people,
and each person

00:15:05.300 --> 00:15:06.890 align:middle line:84%
will draw something
slightly different

00:15:06.890 --> 00:15:08.490 align:middle line:90%
because of their own perception.

00:15:08.490 --> 00:15:12.030 align:middle line:84%
But if we were to go, shall
we say, using your term,

00:15:12.030 --> 00:15:16.030 align:middle line:84%
mainstream with this, you would
see that each of these beings

00:15:16.030 --> 00:15:19.400 align:middle line:84%
would be approximately
9 to 11 feet tall, much

00:15:19.400 --> 00:15:23.700 align:middle line:84%
taller than the average height
on Earth at this time and long.

00:15:23.700 --> 00:15:26.070 align:middle line:84%
So to many, it would
look quite alien,

00:15:26.070 --> 00:15:28.100 align:middle line:90%
and that is not inappropriate.

00:15:28.100 --> 00:15:30.440 align:middle line:84%
But also, there
was a unification

00:15:30.440 --> 00:15:34.050 align:middle line:84%
in these bodies, a unification
that meant that the bodies were

00:15:34.050 --> 00:15:35.770 align:middle line:84%
almost invisible
to the naked eye

00:15:35.770 --> 00:15:37.940 align:middle line:84%
compared to the
average human today.

00:15:37.940 --> 00:15:41.840 align:middle line:84%
The average human today
can be read in density.

00:15:41.840 --> 00:15:46.050 align:middle line:84%
The bodies in Lemuria were
hard to perceive in density

00:15:46.050 --> 00:15:49.360 align:middle line:84%
until the separation act
occurred, a time when

00:15:49.360 --> 00:15:53.970 align:middle line:84%
it was deemed interesting to
separate the bodies into two

00:15:53.970 --> 00:15:57.660 align:middle line:84%
and thus bring separation to the
male and the female energies,

00:15:57.660 --> 00:15:59.250 align:middle line:90%
the yin and the yang.

00:15:59.250 --> 00:16:03.110 align:middle line:84%
So that is the best
description we can give you

00:16:03.110 --> 00:16:04.930 align:middle line:90%
of how different it looked.

00:16:04.930 --> 00:16:08.670 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Now, before the
separation act, as you call it,

00:16:08.670 --> 00:16:13.240 align:middle line:84%
how were the bodies in Lemuria
brought into existence?

00:16:13.240 --> 00:16:16.650 align:middle line:84%
Because obviously it wasn't
through the process we use now.

00:16:16.650 --> 00:16:19.620 align:middle line:84%
>>HARRIS: You would see it as
stars being born into form.

00:16:19.620 --> 00:16:22.640 align:middle line:84%
So many of you understand
that you are made of stars.

00:16:22.640 --> 00:16:25.560 align:middle line:84%
These stars were literally
fostered into existence

00:16:25.560 --> 00:16:26.820 align:middle line:90%
into form.

00:16:26.820 --> 00:16:31.290 align:middle line:84%
There were technologists who did
this, what you might call some

00:16:31.290 --> 00:16:33.560 align:middle line:90%
of the more original creators.

00:16:33.560 --> 00:16:37.380 align:middle line:84%
We cannot, shall we say,
name too much at this time

00:16:37.380 --> 00:16:45.180 align:middle line:84%
because of the allowance of
what is available to each of you

00:16:45.180 --> 00:16:47.150 align:middle line:84%
at this time in
terms of history,

00:16:47.150 --> 00:16:51.590 align:middle line:84%
for too much history information
is not only distracting but can

00:16:51.590 --> 00:16:54.590 align:middle line:84%
disrupt what actually
happened in the past timeline.

00:16:54.590 --> 00:16:57.250 align:middle line:84%
So if we can reveal
too much about what

00:16:57.250 --> 00:17:01.090 align:middle line:84%
happened in the past timeline,
we also potentially interfere

00:17:01.090 --> 00:17:02.800 align:middle line:90%
with where you are now.

00:17:02.800 --> 00:17:07.040 align:middle line:84%
For those who get a
handle on it will use it

00:17:07.040 --> 00:17:09.190 align:middle line:84%
in certain ways
that could disrupt

00:17:09.190 --> 00:17:10.270 align:middle line:90%
what happened back then.

00:17:10.270 --> 00:17:14.849 align:middle line:84%
We understand this is not
news to somebody of your mind

00:17:14.849 --> 00:17:19.140 align:middle line:84%
or to many of your viewers, but
this is why we cannot reveal

00:17:19.140 --> 00:17:19.790 align:middle line:90%
too much.

00:17:19.790 --> 00:17:22.764 align:middle line:84%
We do not mean to be mean,
as you would call it.

00:17:22.764 --> 00:17:23.680 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Withholding.

00:17:23.680 --> 00:17:26.119 align:middle line:84%
>>HARRIS: But understand
there were a group

00:17:26.119 --> 00:17:27.770 align:middle line:90%
of what we will call guardians.

00:17:27.770 --> 00:17:29.800 align:middle line:84%
There were not many
of them in number.

00:17:29.800 --> 00:17:31.560 align:middle line:84%
And they were
seeding these forms

00:17:31.560 --> 00:17:34.310 align:middle line:84%
in Lemuria using the
alchemy of stars.

00:17:34.310 --> 00:17:37.280 align:middle line:84%
So they were literally
able to bring stars down

00:17:37.280 --> 00:17:39.390 align:middle line:90%
into form on the Earth.

00:17:39.390 --> 00:17:41.050 align:middle line:84%
This was something
they did, a little

00:17:41.050 --> 00:17:43.050 align:middle line:84%
like you would see a
laboratory in an experiment

00:17:43.050 --> 00:17:48.310 align:middle line:84%
now but a little more, shall
we say, shamanic and magical

00:17:48.310 --> 00:17:49.560 align:middle line:90%
than it would appear now.

00:17:49.560 --> 00:17:51.850 align:middle line:84%
Now it would appear a little
more earthy in its form,

00:17:51.850 --> 00:17:53.840 align:middle line:84%
but we would argue
that laboratories

00:17:53.840 --> 00:17:55.910 align:middle line:84%
are quite shamanic and
magical in your planet.

00:17:55.910 --> 00:18:00.600 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: [LAUGHS] And the
choice of the Lemurian land

00:18:00.600 --> 00:18:04.890 align:middle line:84%
mass itself, from what I
heard you say a bit ago,

00:18:04.890 --> 00:18:08.200 align:middle line:84%
it was intended that this
land mass was not to continue

00:18:08.200 --> 00:18:10.740 align:middle line:90%
existing after its purpose?

00:18:10.740 --> 00:18:13.610 align:middle line:10%
>>HARRIS: You have to
understand that the interest

00:18:13.610 --> 00:18:17.370 align:middle line:10%
in the universe, as
it were, was to see

00:18:17.370 --> 00:18:20.900 align:middle line:10%
what could be created
beyond the Lemurian

00:18:20.900 --> 00:18:22.730 align:middle line:10%
and the Atlantean phases.

00:18:22.730 --> 00:18:26.870 align:middle line:84%
It was interesting to see how
could you overcome division

00:18:26.870 --> 00:18:29.160 align:middle line:90%
and how could division unify.

00:18:29.160 --> 00:18:32.440 align:middle line:84%
So if you understand that
there were far less people

00:18:32.440 --> 00:18:35.050 align:middle line:84%
at that time-- the
population was not big.

00:18:35.050 --> 00:18:37.220 align:middle line:84%
Compared to now,
it was minuscule

00:18:37.220 --> 00:18:40.390 align:middle line:84%
compared to the population
of Earth's planet now.

00:18:40.390 --> 00:18:43.400 align:middle line:84%
And that is what is so
interesting to energy

00:18:43.400 --> 00:18:44.240 align:middle line:90%
technologists.

00:18:44.240 --> 00:18:46.470 align:middle line:84%
And by the way,
you are those also,

00:18:46.470 --> 00:18:48.410 align:middle line:84%
for you are all part
of this together.

00:18:48.410 --> 00:18:50.130 align:middle line:84%
It is not that there
is some overseer

00:18:50.130 --> 00:18:53.420 align:middle line:84%
and you are just one of their
creations in a laboratory.

00:18:53.420 --> 00:18:57.650 align:middle line:84%
Within the universe, this is
a grand experiment and game

00:18:57.650 --> 00:18:59.650 align:middle line:84%
that all of you are
playing together

00:18:59.650 --> 00:19:02.110 align:middle line:84%
to experience
consciousness through form.

00:19:02.110 --> 00:19:04.590 align:middle line:84%
So what happened in
Lemuria and Atlantis

00:19:04.590 --> 00:19:07.590 align:middle line:84%
was an idea that
you would see how,

00:19:07.590 --> 00:19:10.060 align:middle line:84%
if you divided things
and multiplied things,

00:19:10.060 --> 00:19:11.400 align:middle line:90%
what happened then?

00:19:11.400 --> 00:19:13.290 align:middle line:90%
Could the unity maintain?

00:19:13.290 --> 00:19:14.830 align:middle line:90%
The answer was no.

00:19:14.830 --> 00:19:17.990 align:middle line:84%
So the more spread out
you are as a world,

00:19:17.990 --> 00:19:20.560 align:middle line:84%
the more getting back
to unity is hard.

00:19:20.560 --> 00:19:24.200 align:middle line:84%
This is why small clusters
or friends on Earth or family

00:19:24.200 --> 00:19:27.970 align:middle line:84%
on Earth can hold great levels
of love between themselves,

00:19:27.970 --> 00:19:30.590 align:middle line:84%
yet for you as an entire
population spread across all

00:19:30.590 --> 00:19:32.630 align:middle line:84%
of the countries, it
is not easy for you

00:19:32.630 --> 00:19:34.700 align:middle line:84%
as human beings at
this time to think

00:19:34.700 --> 00:19:37.190 align:middle line:84%
of somebody in another
country as your brother

00:19:37.190 --> 00:19:38.740 align:middle line:90%
or your neighbor.

00:19:38.740 --> 00:19:40.860 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And so with
the disappearance--

00:19:40.860 --> 00:19:45.660 align:middle line:84%
let's say first, did
Lemuria, in fact, sink

00:19:45.660 --> 00:19:51.070 align:middle line:84%
or go away prior to any of
the destructions in Atlantis?

00:19:51.070 --> 00:19:54.160 align:middle line:84%
Was this just something where
the beings had enough notice

00:19:54.160 --> 00:19:57.580 align:middle line:84%
that they were able to migrate
to Atlantis and to other places

00:19:57.580 --> 00:20:00.120 align:middle line:84%
with still high
levels of knowledge?

00:20:00.120 --> 00:20:02.450 align:middle line:84%
Was some of that
seeded elsewhere?

00:20:02.450 --> 00:20:04.200 align:middle line:84%
>>HARRIS: A small
percentage of the beings

00:20:04.200 --> 00:20:07.080 align:middle line:84%
did migrate to Atlantis,
but a very small percentage,

00:20:07.080 --> 00:20:10.650 align:middle line:84%
for you see, form was even
less seen as desirable

00:20:10.650 --> 00:20:12.710 align:middle line:90%
back than it is now.

00:20:12.710 --> 00:20:15.990 align:middle line:84%
So people understood
in those forms

00:20:15.990 --> 00:20:18.250 align:middle line:84%
that they were not that
form and that person.

00:20:18.250 --> 00:20:19.600 align:middle line:90%
They were part of an experiment.

00:20:19.600 --> 00:20:21.890 align:middle line:84%
You see, consciousness
was even deeper.

00:20:21.890 --> 00:20:24.700 align:middle line:84%
But it was in the
phase of Atlantis

00:20:24.700 --> 00:20:26.910 align:middle line:84%
that what you might
call human ego

00:20:26.910 --> 00:20:30.330 align:middle line:84%
took hold, the idea of
wanting to stay in form

00:20:30.330 --> 00:20:32.840 align:middle line:84%
and wanting to
continue to experiment,

00:20:32.840 --> 00:20:35.700 align:middle line:84%
not understanding that a
surrender was required.

00:20:35.700 --> 00:20:38.630 align:middle line:84%
So there was a disconnection
from the divine,

00:20:38.630 --> 00:20:41.860 align:middle line:84%
which we will add,
was always expected.

00:20:41.860 --> 00:20:45.350 align:middle line:84%
But this caused disruption
in the psychology

00:20:45.350 --> 00:20:48.870 align:middle line:84%
and the limited emotional
field of those in Atlantis.

00:20:48.870 --> 00:20:52.210 align:middle line:84%
We say limited not because
their capacity was not vast,

00:20:52.210 --> 00:20:55.650 align:middle line:84%
but you human beings have
many stories and colors

00:20:55.650 --> 00:20:57.300 align:middle line:90%
for your emotional density.

00:20:57.300 --> 00:21:01.600 align:middle line:84%
In Atlantis, emotional
density was just being born.

00:21:01.600 --> 00:21:03.580 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: You were
talking about the stature

00:21:03.580 --> 00:21:06.280 align:middle line:84%
of the beings a little
bit ago, of being

00:21:06.280 --> 00:21:09.990 align:middle line:84%
between 9 and 11 feet tall,
which I found interesting.

00:21:09.990 --> 00:21:12.870 align:middle line:84%
And this is just a personal
aside very quickly, but once

00:21:12.870 --> 00:21:14.310 align:middle line:84%
upon a time a few
years ago when I

00:21:14.310 --> 00:21:18.100 align:middle line:84%
needed to go into a very
active part of my ancient past,

00:21:18.100 --> 00:21:20.470 align:middle line:84%
I was surprised
that in the process

00:21:20.470 --> 00:21:23.900 align:middle line:84%
I noticed it was almost
like Alice in Wonderland.

00:21:23.900 --> 00:21:26.540 align:middle line:84%
I was growing until
I reached somewhere

00:21:26.540 --> 00:21:30.080 align:middle line:84%
between 10 and 12 feet
tall and from that position

00:21:30.080 --> 00:21:33.640 align:middle line:84%
was able to execute what
needed to be done at that time.

00:21:33.640 --> 00:21:36.210 align:middle line:84%
When we go through, others who
go through this experience,

00:21:36.210 --> 00:21:38.490 align:middle line:84%
we're tapping into
the original, maybe,

00:21:38.490 --> 00:21:41.160 align:middle line:84%
energetic matrix we
experienced on Earth?

00:21:41.160 --> 00:21:43.270 align:middle line:84%
>>HARRIS: One such
as you, and the many

00:21:43.270 --> 00:21:46.650 align:middle line:84%
who are tuning into what you
do and also those who do not

00:21:46.650 --> 00:21:48.520 align:middle line:84%
tune into this but
have their own memories

00:21:48.520 --> 00:21:50.810 align:middle line:84%
that they find
through other means,

00:21:50.810 --> 00:21:52.740 align:middle line:90%
have the memory inside you.

00:21:52.740 --> 00:21:55.240 align:middle line:84%
It is why you are what we
would call freedom fighters

00:21:55.240 --> 00:21:58.310 align:middle line:84%
for consciousness, for there
is a part of all of you

00:21:58.310 --> 00:22:01.150 align:middle line:84%
on this planet who recognizes
that something is missing

00:22:01.150 --> 00:22:03.960 align:middle line:84%
from the mass picture and
that that missing piece needs

00:22:03.960 --> 00:22:07.780 align:middle line:84%
to come back for global
harmony to actually take place.

00:22:07.780 --> 00:22:11.650 align:middle line:84%
So in your urgency to want to
help global harmony be achieved

00:22:11.650 --> 00:22:14.690 align:middle line:84%
at a time when global harmony
is needed in order to see

00:22:14.690 --> 00:22:17.690 align:middle line:84%
this population through
its coming decades,

00:22:17.690 --> 00:22:19.810 align:middle line:84%
you have an even
stronger imprint

00:22:19.810 --> 00:22:21.720 align:middle line:90%
that activates inside you.

00:22:21.720 --> 00:22:24.980 align:middle line:84%
So we will say to you, it
is no surprise, of course,

00:22:24.980 --> 00:22:26.070 align:middle line:90%
you were there.

00:22:26.070 --> 00:22:29.060 align:middle line:84%
And so were many of the people
you have been associated with.

00:22:29.060 --> 00:22:30.920 align:middle line:90%
And we will also say this.

00:22:30.920 --> 00:22:32.690 align:middle line:84%
In terms of past
lives, many of you

00:22:32.690 --> 00:22:37.860 align:middle line:84%
think of it as a linear aspect,
where, for example, one person

00:22:37.860 --> 00:22:39.390 align:middle line:90%
was another person.

00:22:39.390 --> 00:22:42.530 align:middle line:84%
But it has become the case
in the last three centuries

00:22:42.530 --> 00:22:47.320 align:middle line:84%
on Earth that many people
incarnate through one.

00:22:47.320 --> 00:22:50.470 align:middle line:84%
So for example, four people
living on Earth today

00:22:50.470 --> 00:22:53.356 align:middle line:84%
could all be sharing a
memory of the same past life.

00:22:53.356 --> 00:22:55.230 align:middle line:84%
And this is not that
they were not that life,

00:22:55.230 --> 00:22:58.420 align:middle line:84%
but it is that there has been an
ability to multiply their soul

00:22:58.420 --> 00:23:01.610 align:middle line:84%
energy when they have left that
life over the periods of years

00:23:01.610 --> 00:23:04.210 align:middle line:84%
that the universe has
evolved so that more of you

00:23:04.210 --> 00:23:06.950 align:middle line:84%
can come back and represent
what that one soul stood

00:23:06.950 --> 00:23:08.110 align:middle line:90%
for back then.

00:23:08.110 --> 00:23:10.390 align:middle line:84%
And if you think about
it, that is not so foreign

00:23:10.390 --> 00:23:13.620 align:middle line:84%
when you realize you are all
surrounded by guides and energy

00:23:13.620 --> 00:23:15.620 align:middle line:84%
beings and soul
family that are not

00:23:15.620 --> 00:23:17.895 align:middle line:84%
apparent in your
one, physical form.

00:23:17.895 --> 00:23:19.770 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Absolutely,
and that is where we're

00:23:19.770 --> 00:23:21.020 align:middle line:90%
headed in the conversation.

00:23:21.020 --> 00:23:23.670 align:middle line:84%
I just wanted to have a
little of the fabric of what

00:23:23.670 --> 00:23:25.270 align:middle line:90%
we were in the past laid out.

00:23:25.270 --> 00:23:28.240 align:middle line:84%
And you just triggered
something that brings

00:23:28.240 --> 00:23:31.720 align:middle line:90%
a tangential question of sorts.

00:23:31.720 --> 00:23:35.450 align:middle line:84%
The notion of
multiple incarnations

00:23:35.450 --> 00:23:38.230 align:middle line:84%
of a soul at a given
period of time--

00:23:38.230 --> 00:23:40.600 align:middle line:84%
might our souls be
expressing ourselves

00:23:40.600 --> 00:23:43.480 align:middle line:84%
in terms of experience
in more than one body

00:23:43.480 --> 00:23:45.610 align:middle line:90%
in a given period of time?

00:23:45.610 --> 00:23:47.310 align:middle line:84%
>>HARRIS: This is
a little rarer,

00:23:47.310 --> 00:23:50.490 align:middle line:84%
but it does happen
with a select few.

00:23:50.490 --> 00:23:53.020 align:middle line:84%
What we would also add
as an addendum to this,

00:23:53.020 --> 00:23:56.350 align:middle line:84%
and this is important for many
of you listening to understand,

00:23:56.350 --> 00:23:58.200 align:middle line:84%
is that many of
you will be doing

00:23:58.200 --> 00:24:00.380 align:middle line:90%
what we call Akashic recall.

00:24:00.380 --> 00:24:02.360 align:middle line:84%
It is checking the
archives for what's

00:24:02.360 --> 00:24:05.440 align:middle line:84%
available to help you on
your missions in your life

00:24:05.440 --> 00:24:06.270 align:middle line:90%
right now.

00:24:06.270 --> 00:24:09.470 align:middle line:84%
So you may recall a life
that was not in fact yours.

00:24:09.470 --> 00:24:12.430 align:middle line:84%
But because you have
multi-dimensional open ability

00:24:12.430 --> 00:24:16.420 align:middle line:84%
to access the Akashic records,
you will call on, for a moment

00:24:16.420 --> 00:24:20.330 align:middle line:84%
or for an afternoon or for a
week, the energy of a life that

00:24:20.330 --> 00:24:22.120 align:middle line:84%
was lived that is in
resonance with one

00:24:22.120 --> 00:24:25.660 align:middle line:84%
that you did not live then but
resonance with that aspect you

00:24:25.660 --> 00:24:27.250 align:middle line:90%
need in the life now.

00:24:27.250 --> 00:24:28.960 align:middle line:84%
So many of you are
doing this also.

00:24:28.960 --> 00:24:32.500 align:middle line:84%
Think of it as
sideways past lives.

00:24:32.500 --> 00:24:34.650 align:middle line:84%
They were not actually
yours, but you reach across,

00:24:34.650 --> 00:24:37.760 align:middle line:84%
and you try them on so that
you have the energy download

00:24:37.760 --> 00:24:40.610 align:middle line:84%
or information that that
life was in possession of so

00:24:40.610 --> 00:24:43.500 align:middle line:84%
that you can carry on
going where you are going.

00:24:43.500 --> 00:24:45.980 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: What about
the instance where

00:24:45.980 --> 00:24:49.270 align:middle line:84%
individuals who may or
may not know each other

00:24:49.270 --> 00:24:53.490 align:middle line:84%
are almost living the same
template out in a given time

00:24:53.490 --> 00:24:56.450 align:middle line:84%
period or the same
impressions are happening,

00:24:56.450 --> 00:24:58.480 align:middle line:84%
the same events are
happening to them

00:24:58.480 --> 00:25:01.540 align:middle line:84%
on the same days, the
same thoughts and feelings

00:25:01.540 --> 00:25:04.320 align:middle line:90%
occur-- What's happening there?

00:25:04.320 --> 00:25:06.690 align:middle line:84%
>>HARRIS: On a more
base level in what you

00:25:06.690 --> 00:25:08.380 align:middle line:84%
would call the lower
dimensions, you

00:25:08.380 --> 00:25:12.380 align:middle line:84%
would call these people soul
family in high resonance.

00:25:12.380 --> 00:25:16.040 align:middle line:84%
And on the highest point within
this arrangement of energy,

00:25:16.040 --> 00:25:18.530 align:middle line:84%
you would call it
oneness in action.

00:25:18.530 --> 00:25:21.660 align:middle line:84%
'Hive mind' is often
a term that is used,

00:25:21.660 --> 00:25:24.880 align:middle line:84%
but the problem with that phrase
is it is not just the mind.

00:25:24.880 --> 00:25:26.910 align:middle line:90%
It is 'hive energy'.

00:25:26.910 --> 00:25:28.980 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Oneness in action?

00:25:28.980 --> 00:25:32.450 align:middle line:84%
And this can happen between
any number of individuals

00:25:32.450 --> 00:25:35.050 align:middle line:84%
at a given time who may or may
not be aware of each other?

00:25:35.050 --> 00:25:38.280 align:middle line:84%
>>HARRIS: If you were to energy
scan a group of individuals

00:25:38.280 --> 00:25:41.330 align:middle line:84%
in one room, all focused
on the same activity--

00:25:41.330 --> 00:25:44.400 align:middle line:84%
so we will give you some
examples-- people who are all

00:25:44.400 --> 00:25:48.090 align:middle line:84%
focused on a highly energized
rock concert and their energy

00:25:48.090 --> 00:25:51.370 align:middle line:84%
and their kundalini is rising in
accordance with the energy that

00:25:51.370 --> 00:25:53.990 align:middle line:84%
has being gathered in
that group or a group who

00:25:53.990 --> 00:25:55.470 align:middle line:90%
are meditating together.

00:25:55.470 --> 00:25:57.970 align:middle line:84%
You will notice that oneness
synchronicity will start

00:25:57.970 --> 00:25:59.850 align:middle line:90%
to happen between these people.

00:25:59.850 --> 00:26:02.690 align:middle line:84%
This is something that is
possible for all of you.

00:26:02.690 --> 00:26:05.240 align:middle line:84%
You could be a planet
full of oneness,

00:26:05.240 --> 00:26:08.060 align:middle line:84%
but it will not happen in
the coming decades because

00:26:08.060 --> 00:26:10.830 align:middle line:84%
of the amount of diversity and
different dimensional levels

00:26:10.830 --> 00:26:13.437 align:middle line:84%
that all of you are
working through.

00:26:13.437 --> 00:26:14.270 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Thank you.

00:26:14.270 --> 00:26:16.040 align:middle line:84%
Yes, I find the
subject fascinating

00:26:16.040 --> 00:26:19.560 align:middle line:84%
when it's very specific
and ongoing in particular.

00:26:19.560 --> 00:26:24.330 align:middle line:84%
Let's talk about beings
such as yourselves,

00:26:24.330 --> 00:26:27.100 align:middle line:84%
the role of the
interdimensional beings,

00:26:27.100 --> 00:26:30.550 align:middle line:84%
why it's necessary
on this planet for us

00:26:30.550 --> 00:26:33.890 align:middle line:84%
to have relationships with
interdimensional beings?

00:26:33.890 --> 00:26:37.590 align:middle line:84%
Is there something
inherently lacking

00:26:37.590 --> 00:26:40.520 align:middle line:84%
in our species or something
that has yet to be developed

00:26:40.520 --> 00:26:42.200 align:middle line:90%
or something forgotten?

00:26:42.200 --> 00:26:45.130 align:middle line:84%
Let's talk about the
function of beings

00:26:45.130 --> 00:26:47.760 align:middle line:84%
like you working
with beings like us.

00:26:47.760 --> 00:26:50.520 align:middle line:84%
>>HARRIS: Your question is
good, for it taps into the,

00:26:50.520 --> 00:26:52.500 align:middle line:84%
shall we say,
lower belief system

00:26:52.500 --> 00:26:54.780 align:middle line:84%
that many human beings
carry about spirit

00:26:54.780 --> 00:26:56.770 align:middle line:90%
or interdimensional beings.

00:26:56.770 --> 00:26:58.630 align:middle line:84%
There is often this
idea that because it

00:26:58.630 --> 00:27:01.270 align:middle line:84%
comes from outside the
body or a higher place,

00:27:01.270 --> 00:27:05.020 align:middle line:84%
it is better or
more than humanity.

00:27:05.020 --> 00:27:08.170 align:middle line:84%
And then in the more
extreme end of the scale,

00:27:08.170 --> 00:27:11.270 align:middle line:84%
it is something to be
feared or suspicious of.

00:27:11.270 --> 00:27:15.100 align:middle line:84%
The truth is that humanity has
called this forward for itself.

00:27:15.100 --> 00:27:18.080 align:middle line:84%
So it can often look like
we are the ones bringing

00:27:18.080 --> 00:27:21.900 align:middle line:84%
this information in, but it
takes a human being to listen.

00:27:21.900 --> 00:27:24.290 align:middle line:84%
It takes a human being
to sense and feel.

00:27:24.290 --> 00:27:26.140 align:middle line:84%
It takes the arrangement
of a conversation

00:27:26.140 --> 00:27:28.320 align:middle line:84%
like this for this
kind of information

00:27:28.320 --> 00:27:29.880 align:middle line:90%
to be brought through.

00:27:29.880 --> 00:27:34.540 align:middle line:84%
So what we will say is your
humanity cannot continue unless

00:27:34.540 --> 00:27:37.770 align:middle line:84%
it becomes more
interdimensional in the future.

00:27:37.770 --> 00:27:40.180 align:middle line:84%
This is the way that the
planet and its people

00:27:40.180 --> 00:27:41.510 align:middle line:90%
are being called.

00:27:41.510 --> 00:27:44.770 align:middle line:84%
The universe is vast and
interdimensional in nature.

00:27:44.770 --> 00:27:48.030 align:middle line:84%
And Earth is reaching
a point in her history

00:27:48.030 --> 00:27:51.140 align:middle line:84%
where it will
become more unified

00:27:51.140 --> 00:27:53.670 align:middle line:84%
with the rest of the
universe, as it were,

00:27:53.670 --> 00:27:55.910 align:middle line:90%
and the life beyond Earth.

00:27:55.910 --> 00:27:58.510 align:middle line:84%
So the interdimensional
nature of the growth

00:27:58.510 --> 00:28:02.560 align:middle line:84%
of what we refer to as
'hive energy' is simply

00:28:02.560 --> 00:28:06.850 align:middle line:84%
helping humanity to
prepare and become more

00:28:06.850 --> 00:28:10.570 align:middle line:84%
readied for the more
interdimensional nature of life

00:28:10.570 --> 00:28:11.640 align:middle line:90%
in a broader universe.

00:28:11.640 --> 00:28:13.890 align:middle line:84%
Now, we should
qualify this by saying

00:28:13.890 --> 00:28:17.660 align:middle line:84%
this could be still hundreds
and hundreds of years away.

00:28:17.660 --> 00:28:21.710 align:middle line:84%
This is all what
you would call open,

00:28:21.710 --> 00:28:25.620 align:middle line:84%
for everything is very
specific on Earth right now.

00:28:25.620 --> 00:28:29.260 align:middle line:84%
And everything that changes
in the most minuscule way

00:28:29.260 --> 00:28:30.690 align:middle line:90%
has a knock-on effect.

00:28:30.690 --> 00:28:33.150 align:middle line:84%
To say that your planet
is in a sensitive time

00:28:33.150 --> 00:28:34.890 align:middle line:90%
would be an understatement.

00:28:34.890 --> 00:28:37.820 align:middle line:84%
We must be careful when we
use terms like sensitive,

00:28:37.820 --> 00:28:40.050 align:middle line:84%
for so many of you
like to jump to fear.

00:28:40.050 --> 00:28:42.570 align:middle line:84%
You think of the environment
and some of the issues

00:28:42.570 --> 00:28:45.790 align:middle line:84%
that you are hearing about
with global warming and beyond,

00:28:45.790 --> 00:28:47.990 align:middle line:84%
and you also look at
some of the conflicts.

00:28:47.990 --> 00:28:49.540 align:middle line:90%
It is more than that, though.

00:28:49.540 --> 00:28:51.330 align:middle line:90%
It is more than all of that.

00:28:51.330 --> 00:28:53.390 align:middle line:84%
The Earth is at a
very sensitive time

00:28:53.390 --> 00:28:55.690 align:middle line:90%
of trying to open its senses.

00:28:55.690 --> 00:28:58.190 align:middle line:84%
And that is not something that
the Earth has been allowed

00:28:58.190 --> 00:29:00.110 align:middle line:90%
to do for such a long time.

00:29:00.110 --> 00:29:02.930 align:middle line:84%
Nature could never be
denied the sensory aspects.

00:29:02.930 --> 00:29:06.820 align:middle line:84%
So man has constantly been
surrounded by the sensory.

00:29:06.820 --> 00:29:08.700 align:middle line:84%
And yet man within
the sensory has

00:29:08.700 --> 00:29:10.840 align:middle line:84%
been asked to deaden
from the sensory

00:29:10.840 --> 00:29:14.860 align:middle line:84%
and to ignore the sensory
and to chop the sensory down

00:29:14.860 --> 00:29:16.450 align:middle line:90%
without a second thought.

00:29:16.450 --> 00:29:18.710 align:middle line:84%
And now you are in
this time of awakening,

00:29:18.710 --> 00:29:21.610 align:middle line:84%
where the humans are beginning
to look around the world

00:29:21.610 --> 00:29:23.950 align:middle line:84%
and say things
along the lines of,

00:29:23.950 --> 00:29:26.930 align:middle line:84%
this is not the right
picture we need to create.

00:29:26.930 --> 00:29:29.510 align:middle line:84%
And it is not just our
minds or our research

00:29:29.510 --> 00:29:30.660 align:middle line:90%
which is telling us that.

00:29:30.660 --> 00:29:32.640 align:middle line:90%
It is our opening feeling.

00:29:32.640 --> 00:29:35.700 align:middle line:84%
As humanity opens its
feeling and its senses,

00:29:35.700 --> 00:29:37.690 align:middle line:84%
it will start to make
the right decisions

00:29:37.690 --> 00:29:39.750 align:middle line:90%
and indeed already is.

00:29:39.750 --> 00:29:42.860 align:middle line:84%
But as time goes on,
interdimensional living

00:29:42.860 --> 00:29:45.080 align:middle line:84%
on this planet will
become more and more

00:29:45.080 --> 00:29:47.710 align:middle line:84%
the norm, which is
why it is difficult

00:29:47.710 --> 00:29:50.250 align:middle line:84%
for awakening and sensitive
souls at this time

00:29:50.250 --> 00:29:53.020 align:middle line:84%
if they are too isolated
with their own way of feeling

00:29:53.020 --> 00:29:53.720 align:middle line:90%
the world.

00:29:53.720 --> 00:29:55.910 align:middle line:84%
They can feel like
the odd one out.

00:29:55.910 --> 00:29:59.270 align:middle line:84%
That's why we advise all
of you to come together

00:29:59.270 --> 00:30:01.640 align:middle line:84%
as much as you can,
for you have strength

00:30:01.640 --> 00:30:07.037 align:middle line:84%
in numbers, internal strength
and effective action strength.

00:30:07.037 --> 00:30:09.120 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: OK, this leads
me to two different lines

00:30:09.120 --> 00:30:09.840 align:middle line:90%
of questioning.

00:30:09.840 --> 00:30:14.270 align:middle line:84%
One is, is the human
species unique in our need

00:30:14.270 --> 00:30:16.850 align:middle line:84%
for interdimensional
and guidance outside

00:30:16.850 --> 00:30:18.513 align:middle line:90%
of our own knowingness?

00:30:18.513 --> 00:30:20.940 align:middle line:84%
>>HARRIS: No, this
is common to all.

00:30:20.940 --> 00:30:23.000 align:middle line:84%
Your animals on this
planet are constantly

00:30:23.000 --> 00:30:25.266 align:middle line:84%
having interdimensional
communication

00:30:25.266 --> 00:30:27.140 align:middle line:84%
to different degrees,
depending on the animal

00:30:27.140 --> 00:30:28.350 align:middle line:90%
and its consciousness.

00:30:28.350 --> 00:30:30.480 align:middle line:84%
But you only have to
watch your dogs and cats

00:30:30.480 --> 00:30:33.420 align:middle line:84%
to watch them watching things
in the room all of the time.

00:30:33.420 --> 00:30:35.109 align:middle line:84%
So if anything,
we would argue it

00:30:35.109 --> 00:30:36.400 align:middle line:90%
is almost the other way around.

00:30:36.400 --> 00:30:36.930 align:middle line:90%
Ha.

00:30:36.930 --> 00:30:40.150 align:middle line:84%
Humans are a little late
to the party as a mass,

00:30:40.150 --> 00:30:43.470 align:middle line:84%
not in their experience of
interdimensional communication,

00:30:43.470 --> 00:30:45.870 align:middle line:84%
for it has been
going on for eons,

00:30:45.870 --> 00:30:48.630 align:middle line:84%
but in their ability
to be, we will say,

00:30:48.630 --> 00:30:51.020 align:middle line:90%
allowed to be aware of it.

00:30:51.020 --> 00:30:53.820 align:middle line:84%
For there have been many
constraints and discouragements

00:30:53.820 --> 00:30:58.897 align:middle line:84%
put in place to discourage
humans from investigating.

00:30:58.897 --> 00:31:00.980 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Now the other
strand of thought off this

00:31:00.980 --> 00:31:04.790 align:middle line:84%
was you were just speaking about
the potential for the oneness,

00:31:04.790 --> 00:31:08.620 align:middle line:90%
the hive understanding of life.

00:31:08.620 --> 00:31:15.604 align:middle line:84%
And how does this play out in
the face of blatant free will?

00:31:15.604 --> 00:31:17.270 align:middle line:84%
>>HARRIS: Blatant
free will is something

00:31:17.270 --> 00:31:20.960 align:middle line:84%
that will become less
individuated as time goes on.

00:31:20.960 --> 00:31:24.790 align:middle line:84%
You see, many of you,
because you are individuated,

00:31:24.790 --> 00:31:28.810 align:middle line:84%
tend to think of your free will
as very much your own life.

00:31:28.810 --> 00:31:31.415 align:middle line:84%
And even those of you
who make choices believe

00:31:31.415 --> 00:31:34.510 align:middle line:84%
that you are making a grand
choice to move location,

00:31:34.510 --> 00:31:37.210 align:middle line:84%
or you are making a grand
choice to no longer be friends

00:31:37.210 --> 00:31:40.100 align:middle line:84%
with that person, or you are
making a grand choice to change

00:31:40.100 --> 00:31:40.600 align:middle line:90%
your career.

00:31:40.600 --> 00:31:43.120 align:middle line:84%
And we will tell you,
it just is not that way.

00:31:43.120 --> 00:31:45.500 align:middle line:84%
There are already energies
that have been in place.

00:31:45.500 --> 00:31:48.740 align:middle line:84%
You are, again, usually
the last ones to the party.

00:31:48.740 --> 00:31:51.150 align:middle line:84%
You have this idea that
you are going to move.

00:31:51.150 --> 00:31:53.270 align:middle line:84%
But the only reason you
are now going to move

00:31:53.270 --> 00:31:56.990 align:middle line:84%
is because a silent or even a
conscious thought in you a year

00:31:56.990 --> 00:32:00.160 align:middle line:84%
or two years ago
that sowed that seed

00:32:00.160 --> 00:32:03.410 align:middle line:84%
has allowed the energy in
your life to rearrange itself.

00:32:03.410 --> 00:32:06.830 align:middle line:84%
So you do have free
will in a certain sense,

00:32:06.830 --> 00:32:09.190 align:middle line:84%
but we would also say
to you that you will not

00:32:09.190 --> 00:32:12.970 align:middle line:84%
feel as an individual that
your free will is dampened

00:32:12.970 --> 00:32:16.020 align:middle line:84%
once you are more hive
around your free will.

00:32:16.020 --> 00:32:17.220 align:middle line:90%
And again, we qualify.

00:32:17.220 --> 00:32:20.470 align:middle line:84%
This hive existence is
several hundred years away

00:32:20.470 --> 00:32:23.160 align:middle line:84%
at this point in the
timeline, if it even

00:32:23.160 --> 00:32:25.840 align:middle line:84%
is able to take place
on Earth in that way.

00:32:25.840 --> 00:32:27.730 align:middle line:84%
So it is more that
some of you are

00:32:27.730 --> 00:32:31.420 align:middle line:84%
beginning to have parts
of that hive experience

00:32:31.420 --> 00:32:32.750 align:middle line:90%
in your everyday life.

00:32:32.750 --> 00:32:35.860 align:middle line:84%
Think of when you love
a partner or a friend.

00:32:35.860 --> 00:32:38.180 align:middle line:84%
You do not tend
to fight over who

00:32:38.180 --> 00:32:40.090 align:middle line:84%
is choosing what
restaurant, because you so

00:32:40.090 --> 00:32:43.090 align:middle line:84%
enjoy being in synchronicity
that you trust the other one

00:32:43.090 --> 00:32:44.860 align:middle line:90%
to lead you to the right place.

00:32:44.860 --> 00:32:46.860 align:middle line:84%
That is quite different
when you are on your own

00:32:46.860 --> 00:32:49.140 align:middle line:84%
or with someone you
feel in conflict with.

00:32:49.140 --> 00:32:51.577 align:middle line:84%
So hive is simply that
experience magnified.

00:32:51.577 --> 00:32:52.410 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Resonance.

00:32:52.410 --> 00:32:54.760 align:middle line:90%
Yes, I hear you.

00:32:54.760 --> 00:32:58.410 align:middle line:84%
And there are various physicists
who have written books

00:32:58.410 --> 00:33:00.710 align:middle line:90%
and lectured on the subject.

00:33:00.710 --> 00:33:02.950 align:middle line:84%
A term they use is
entropy and that we

00:33:02.950 --> 00:33:06.700 align:middle line:84%
feel we have free will,
yet in reality, everything

00:33:06.700 --> 00:33:09.080 align:middle line:84%
we've experienced,
the decisions that we

00:33:09.080 --> 00:33:11.120 align:middle line:84%
appear to have made in
the past, the culture

00:33:11.120 --> 00:33:13.560 align:middle line:84%
we chose to be born
into, is essentially

00:33:13.560 --> 00:33:15.580 align:middle line:84%
collapsing potentials
all the time

00:33:15.580 --> 00:33:19.090 align:middle line:84%
to where this great moment
of this decision, this act

00:33:19.090 --> 00:33:23.700 align:middle line:84%
of free will, in fact is,
through those other mechanisms,

00:33:23.700 --> 00:33:25.680 align:middle line:90%
more or less predetermined.

00:33:25.680 --> 00:33:28.750 align:middle line:84%
>>HARRIS: You will all be better
as a collective around the idea

00:33:28.750 --> 00:33:30.920 align:middle line:84%
that you have free
will once you have all

00:33:30.920 --> 00:33:33.230 align:middle line:90%
made peace with old age.

00:33:33.230 --> 00:33:34.189 align:middle line:90%
This is a long way off.

00:33:34.189 --> 00:33:35.605 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Ooh,
yes, please explain

00:33:35.605 --> 00:33:36.750 align:middle line:90%
this in more detail to us.

00:33:36.750 --> 00:33:39.250 align:middle line:84%
>>HARRIS: If you all had free
will, the one thing all of you

00:33:39.250 --> 00:33:41.600 align:middle line:84%
would ask to do is stop
your age at a certain point,

00:33:41.600 --> 00:33:44.980 align:middle line:84%
because you would not want your
bodies to go towards decay.

00:33:44.980 --> 00:33:47.150 align:middle line:84%
You would want your
bodies to stay at a place

00:33:47.150 --> 00:33:48.860 align:middle line:84%
that you could
continue to experience

00:33:48.860 --> 00:33:52.020 align:middle line:84%
more and more in your
evolutionary natures

00:33:52.020 --> 00:33:54.540 align:middle line:84%
and your experiences
of the world.

00:33:54.540 --> 00:33:58.570 align:middle line:84%
So until you all come to
peace that as a human being

00:33:58.570 --> 00:34:00.650 align:middle line:84%
going through the older
years, the what you

00:34:00.650 --> 00:34:03.370 align:middle line:84%
would call more vulnerable
years, the sometimes physically

00:34:03.370 --> 00:34:05.580 align:middle line:84%
weaker years, more
challenging years,

00:34:05.580 --> 00:34:08.210 align:middle line:84%
until you come to peace that
that is a part of the journey--

00:34:08.210 --> 00:34:11.420 align:middle line:84%
and most of you pretend
it doesn't exist.

00:34:11.420 --> 00:34:15.280 align:middle line:84%
You look at older people as what
you would think as poor them

00:34:15.280 --> 00:34:17.420 align:middle line:84%
without realizing you
are looking in the mirror

00:34:17.420 --> 00:34:18.880 align:middle line:90%
some years ahead.

00:34:18.880 --> 00:34:22.800 align:middle line:84%
So what we would say is when
your planet and your people

00:34:22.800 --> 00:34:25.409 align:middle line:84%
get to a place where
they agree to accept

00:34:25.409 --> 00:34:28.260 align:middle line:84%
that perhaps being an
85- or a 90-year-old

00:34:28.260 --> 00:34:31.540 align:middle line:84%
is as valid as being a
20- or a 50-year-old,

00:34:31.540 --> 00:34:34.389 align:middle line:84%
then you will all be willing
to agree with this idea

00:34:34.389 --> 00:34:35.752 align:middle line:90%
that you have free will.

00:34:35.752 --> 00:34:37.210 align:middle line:84%
But while there
are things you have

00:34:37.210 --> 00:34:41.050 align:middle line:84%
conflict around as human
beings, this being one of them,

00:34:41.050 --> 00:34:44.130 align:middle line:84%
free will is a nice
idea that you can try on

00:34:44.130 --> 00:34:47.130 align:middle line:84%
in compartmentalized moments,
but it is not something

00:34:47.130 --> 00:34:50.252 align:middle line:84%
that any of you are
truly, fully agreeing to.

00:34:50.252 --> 00:34:51.590 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Hmm.

00:34:51.590 --> 00:34:55.420 align:middle line:84%
Maybe, though this is a
little sophomoric, maybe

00:34:55.420 --> 00:34:58.980 align:middle line:84%
you can reflect back
to us the greatest

00:34:58.980 --> 00:35:02.800 align:middle line:84%
opportunity and potential in
those later years in life,

00:35:02.800 --> 00:35:06.170 align:middle line:84%
as you say, the years
of 80, 90, to 100.

00:35:06.170 --> 00:35:07.800 align:middle line:84%
From your point of
view, what do you

00:35:07.800 --> 00:35:10.690 align:middle line:84%
see as the grace and beauty
in these years for us?

00:35:10.690 --> 00:35:13.680 align:middle line:10%
>>HARRIS: The two sides
we would offer you here,

00:35:13.680 --> 00:35:18.230 align:middle line:10%
the most important and the
first is giving of your wisdom.

00:35:18.230 --> 00:35:21.650 align:middle line:10%
You see, you have a
perspective of not only years

00:35:21.650 --> 00:35:24.130 align:middle line:10%
but also many transformations.

00:35:24.130 --> 00:35:26.570 align:middle line:84%
If you think of your
typical 90-year-old,

00:35:26.570 --> 00:35:29.400 align:middle line:84%
they have seen this world
change five or six times

00:35:29.400 --> 00:35:31.630 align:middle line:90%
in very big, dramatic ways.

00:35:31.630 --> 00:35:33.370 align:middle line:84%
So there is something
they can teach

00:35:33.370 --> 00:35:35.830 align:middle line:84%
about the patience
and the ability

00:35:35.830 --> 00:35:37.430 align:middle line:90%
to move with transformation.

00:35:37.430 --> 00:35:40.380 align:middle line:84%
And yet so often, these
elders are isolated.

00:35:40.380 --> 00:35:42.600 align:middle line:84%
They are put into homes
with other elders.

00:35:42.600 --> 00:35:43.820 align:middle line:90%
They are left.

00:35:43.820 --> 00:35:46.490 align:middle line:84%
They are discarded because they
cannot keep up with the young

00:35:46.490 --> 00:35:47.030 align:middle line:90%
ones.

00:35:47.030 --> 00:35:48.860 align:middle line:90%
So they are forgotten about.

00:35:48.860 --> 00:35:51.910 align:middle line:84%
So this is where their sadness
and pain and vulnerability

00:35:51.910 --> 00:35:54.740 align:middle line:84%
comes from, for they are
forgotten by everybody

00:35:54.740 --> 00:35:57.400 align:middle line:84%
at a time where their
actual gift as a soul

00:35:57.400 --> 00:35:59.210 align:middle line:84%
is to be able to
offer to everybody.

00:35:59.210 --> 00:36:01.629 align:middle line:84%
Yes, they will not run
around the field, maybe,

00:36:01.629 --> 00:36:03.670 align:middle line:84%
with the young ones, but
when the young ones have

00:36:03.670 --> 00:36:06.391 align:middle line:84%
run around the field and they
come back and speak about it,

00:36:06.391 --> 00:36:08.140 align:middle line:84%
there will be a
conversation in which they

00:36:08.140 --> 00:36:10.100 align:middle line:90%
can contribute and give.

00:36:10.100 --> 00:36:12.220 align:middle line:84%
The other side, on a more
personal level, and this

00:36:12.220 --> 00:36:15.280 align:middle line:84%
is what we see taking place more
effectively than the first part

00:36:15.280 --> 00:36:21.000 align:middle line:84%
we spoke about, is the ability
to convalesce and to reflect

00:36:21.000 --> 00:36:23.980 align:middle line:84%
on your life lived and
your experience on Earth

00:36:23.980 --> 00:36:27.690 align:middle line:84%
and to build what you
might call bridges,

00:36:27.690 --> 00:36:31.820 align:middle line:84%
not just with others that there
have been conflict areas with,

00:36:31.820 --> 00:36:34.940 align:middle line:84%
but also within the self, parts
of the psyche or the emotions

00:36:34.940 --> 00:36:37.710 align:middle line:84%
that you could never quite
calm or come to peace

00:36:37.710 --> 00:36:39.320 align:middle line:90%
with in your early years.

00:36:39.320 --> 00:36:41.920 align:middle line:84%
You suddenly are able
to let it all go.

00:36:41.920 --> 00:36:44.110 align:middle line:84%
So it is a shame
that for many, it

00:36:44.110 --> 00:36:46.790 align:middle line:84%
takes being that
old to truly start

00:36:46.790 --> 00:36:49.140 align:middle line:90%
to feel the wonder of it all.

00:36:49.140 --> 00:36:51.460 align:middle line:84%
This is why the
happier elder people

00:36:51.460 --> 00:36:54.310 align:middle line:84%
are ones who become
more gloriously what

00:36:54.310 --> 00:36:56.400 align:middle line:90%
you would call childlike.

00:36:56.400 --> 00:36:58.330 align:middle line:84%
They suddenly have
wonder in their eyes,

00:36:58.330 --> 00:37:01.110 align:middle line:84%
because they understand
that there is a time limit

00:37:01.110 --> 00:37:03.950 align:middle line:84%
physically, and they know
to appreciate everything,

00:37:03.950 --> 00:37:06.100 align:middle line:84%
for they are not rushing
to the next thing.

00:37:06.100 --> 00:37:09.250 align:middle line:84%
They are in that thing right
there that day with you.

00:37:09.250 --> 00:37:12.120 align:middle line:84%
And for many of you, it is
too much for you to handle.

00:37:12.120 --> 00:37:15.830 align:middle line:84%
It takes a certain level of
consciousness and open heart

00:37:15.830 --> 00:37:19.649 align:middle line:84%
to be able to meet an elder
who is emanating that energy.

00:37:19.649 --> 00:37:20.690 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes, thank you.

00:37:20.690 --> 00:37:22.960 align:middle line:84%
That's a very
beautiful reflection.

00:37:22.960 --> 00:37:25.770 align:middle line:84%
I would like to
find out now, coming

00:37:25.770 --> 00:37:27.830 align:middle line:84%
into the part of
the conversation

00:37:27.830 --> 00:37:29.920 align:middle line:84%
about our interfacing
with guidance,

00:37:29.920 --> 00:37:33.100 align:middle line:84%
what it's like from your
perspective from your realm,

00:37:33.100 --> 00:37:35.401 align:middle line:84%
not necessarily with Lee,
because this connection has

00:37:35.401 --> 00:37:35.900 align:middle line:90%
been made.

00:37:35.900 --> 00:37:42.360 align:middle line:84%
But in general, what is it like
for beings from another field

00:37:42.360 --> 00:37:45.650 align:middle line:84%
trying to communicate
with human beings?

00:37:45.650 --> 00:37:47.760 align:middle line:84%
>>HARRIS: Well, there
are many different roles.

00:37:47.760 --> 00:37:50.990 align:middle line:84%
So for example, we are
little like a library,

00:37:50.990 --> 00:37:54.090 align:middle line:84%
and communication is
our deep interface.

00:37:54.090 --> 00:37:56.390 align:middle line:84%
So even though the
communication is

00:37:56.390 --> 00:37:58.580 align:middle line:84%
what you might call
the distraction here,

00:37:58.580 --> 00:38:03.340 align:middle line:84%
yes, you are aware that the
energy field of Lee has changed

00:38:03.340 --> 00:38:05.350 align:middle line:84%
and that the energy
field above his head

00:38:05.350 --> 00:38:07.370 align:middle line:84%
has become bigger
and wider, for there

00:38:07.370 --> 00:38:09.160 align:middle line:90%
is an interface taking place.

00:38:09.160 --> 00:38:11.270 align:middle line:84%
But, communication
is the skill here.

00:38:11.270 --> 00:38:15.900 align:middle line:84%
So that is what is taking
place between he and we.

00:38:15.900 --> 00:38:18.970 align:middle line:84%
And we are using our
own ability as what

00:38:18.970 --> 00:38:22.450 align:middle line:84%
you might call a universal
library to bring through

00:38:22.450 --> 00:38:27.140 align:middle line:84%
the information, both
energetic and descriptive, that

00:38:27.140 --> 00:38:28.990 align:middle line:90%
best helps human beings open.

00:38:28.990 --> 00:38:33.390 align:middle line:84%
So that is one role that a
being who is energetic can play.

00:38:33.390 --> 00:38:35.540 align:middle line:84%
Then, many of you
have given this name

00:38:35.540 --> 00:38:39.140 align:middle line:84%
angels to those that can
manipulate things for you.

00:38:39.140 --> 00:38:41.740 align:middle line:84%
So you see, we are one
thing, but the beings that

00:38:41.740 --> 00:38:44.790 align:middle line:84%
can hide your favorite object,
because it's important for you

00:38:44.790 --> 00:38:47.470 align:middle line:84%
to not have it that day,
or the beings that can,

00:38:47.470 --> 00:38:49.450 align:middle line:84%
and we use this with
humor, but it is true,

00:38:49.450 --> 00:38:52.630 align:middle line:84%
get you a parking space if
you hold enough intention

00:38:52.630 --> 00:38:55.680 align:middle line:84%
around it-- the beings who
do that, you would refer

00:38:55.680 --> 00:39:00.080 align:middle line:84%
to as angels-- the ones who can
physically manipulate and move

00:39:00.080 --> 00:39:00.860 align:middle line:90%
things.

00:39:00.860 --> 00:39:03.870 align:middle line:84%
It is not to say that we can't
do that or that they cannot

00:39:03.870 --> 00:39:05.350 align:middle line:90%
communicate.

00:39:05.350 --> 00:39:07.350 align:middle line:90%
There are overlaps in all.

00:39:07.350 --> 00:39:10.300 align:middle line:84%
But we would say to you that
there are many different beings

00:39:10.300 --> 00:39:11.710 align:middle line:90%
with many different roles.

00:39:11.710 --> 00:39:15.560 align:middle line:84%
Just as on Earth, there
is a doctor and a chef

00:39:15.560 --> 00:39:17.980 align:middle line:84%
and a mother and
a teacher-- there

00:39:17.980 --> 00:39:20.880 align:middle line:84%
are many different roles
within the energy world.

00:39:20.880 --> 00:39:23.830 align:middle line:84%
For example, you often
refer to the energy sprites

00:39:23.830 --> 00:39:26.350 align:middle line:84%
who take care with and
interact with nature

00:39:26.350 --> 00:39:29.700 align:middle line:84%
and keep the energy balanced
as sprites or fairies.

00:39:29.700 --> 00:39:31.630 align:middle line:84%
There are different
names you all give.

00:39:31.630 --> 00:39:33.390 align:middle line:84%
But if we were to
show you the picture

00:39:33.390 --> 00:39:36.000 align:middle line:84%
of how many different kinds
of energy beings there are,

00:39:36.000 --> 00:39:37.780 align:middle line:84%
you would be shocked,
for many of you

00:39:37.780 --> 00:39:40.220 align:middle line:84%
like to think of it
as up to five or six.

00:39:40.220 --> 00:39:42.545 align:middle line:84%
And in fact, it is
multiple thousands.

00:39:42.545 --> 00:39:43.880 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: How interesting.

00:39:43.880 --> 00:39:46.680 align:middle line:84%
How do they do it, anyway, the
ones who hide things from you?

00:39:46.680 --> 00:39:49.020 align:middle line:84%
And there it is sitting
right there the next day.

00:39:49.020 --> 00:39:51.470 align:middle line:84%
>>HARRIS: The irony
is you do it too.

00:39:51.470 --> 00:39:54.100 align:middle line:84%
So something in you is
pulsing out a desire

00:39:54.100 --> 00:39:56.720 align:middle line:84%
to have either a shift
in your awareness

00:39:56.720 --> 00:39:59.540 align:middle line:84%
or sometimes it
snaps some of you

00:39:59.540 --> 00:40:02.710 align:middle line:84%
into consciousness to recognize
it has actually happened.

00:40:02.710 --> 00:40:05.270 align:middle line:84%
And other times, it is
to get your attention.

00:40:05.270 --> 00:40:07.430 align:middle line:84%
But most of the time, it
is because the removal

00:40:07.430 --> 00:40:09.440 align:middle line:84%
of that physical object
or the introduction

00:40:09.440 --> 00:40:12.130 align:middle line:84%
of that physical object
has a big impact on you

00:40:12.130 --> 00:40:13.270 align:middle line:90%
energetically.

00:40:13.270 --> 00:40:16.530 align:middle line:84%
So just as dreams are a
very useful way for you

00:40:16.530 --> 00:40:18.220 align:middle line:84%
to clear energies
that you don't need

00:40:18.220 --> 00:40:21.760 align:middle line:84%
to play out in a more dramatic
way in your day, so, too,

00:40:21.760 --> 00:40:24.120 align:middle line:84%
can this moving
of objects be ways

00:40:24.120 --> 00:40:26.730 align:middle line:84%
that your energy
can stay balanced.

00:40:26.730 --> 00:40:31.330 align:middle line:84%
We will give you an example
that is a little crude.

00:40:31.330 --> 00:40:34.700 align:middle line:84%
But it will illustrate
what we are trying to say.

00:40:34.700 --> 00:40:37.000 align:middle line:84%
Think of your team of
angels watching you

00:40:37.000 --> 00:40:39.450 align:middle line:84%
and six of your
friends running a race.

00:40:39.450 --> 00:40:41.240 align:middle line:84%
They suddenly see
that you, Regina, are

00:40:41.240 --> 00:40:44.290 align:middle line:84%
very close to getting to
the finish line for yourself

00:40:44.290 --> 00:40:46.170 align:middle line:84%
in this area you're
trying to develop in,

00:40:46.170 --> 00:40:48.150 align:middle line:84%
but you just get
slightly distracted

00:40:48.150 --> 00:40:50.970 align:middle line:84%
by someone who is watching
you in the audience.

00:40:50.970 --> 00:40:54.030 align:middle line:84%
And as you get distracted, you
start to lose your footing.

00:40:54.030 --> 00:40:56.010 align:middle line:84%
So they will do
something to help

00:40:56.010 --> 00:40:57.250 align:middle line:90%
you get back on your footing.

00:40:57.250 --> 00:41:00.260 align:middle line:84%
There is a certain amount
that you can be helped.

00:41:00.260 --> 00:41:03.310 align:middle line:84%
It is not the kind of
help that can completely

00:41:03.310 --> 00:41:06.440 align:middle line:84%
reverse your destiny
or reverse your destiny

00:41:06.440 --> 00:41:09.190 align:middle line:84%
without your free will and
your desire being involved,

00:41:09.190 --> 00:41:12.530 align:middle line:84%
but small acts of help can
happen all along the way.

00:41:12.530 --> 00:41:16.400 align:middle line:84%
And so you see, someone
else is as invested

00:41:16.400 --> 00:41:18.780 align:middle line:84%
in your growth and your
evolution as you are.

00:41:18.780 --> 00:41:23.250 align:middle line:84%
This is why you often hear the
phrase "you are not alone."

00:41:23.250 --> 00:41:23.970 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:41:23.970 --> 00:41:28.030 align:middle line:84%
And yet, so many people
feel completely alone

00:41:28.030 --> 00:41:33.210 align:middle line:84%
and are not consciously aware
of the guidance or help that's

00:41:33.210 --> 00:41:37.640 align:middle line:84%
being given, because maybe we
have issues of extreme control

00:41:37.640 --> 00:41:41.310 align:middle line:90%
and stubbornness and so forth.

00:41:41.310 --> 00:41:44.170 align:middle line:84%
How does a particular
being who is

00:41:44.170 --> 00:41:46.930 align:middle line:84%
chosen to work with a
very stubborn individual

00:41:46.930 --> 00:41:50.270 align:middle line:84%
or close-minded
individual begin generally

00:41:50.270 --> 00:41:51.480 align:middle line:90%
getting their attention?

00:41:51.480 --> 00:41:52.980 align:middle line:84%
>>HARRIS: Those are
the ones who are

00:41:52.980 --> 00:41:54.480 align:middle line:90%
the most loving and patient.

00:41:54.480 --> 00:41:57.680 align:middle line:84%
So the ones with the most
capacity for love and patience

00:41:57.680 --> 00:42:00.030 align:middle line:84%
will be sent to that
stubborn individual.

00:42:00.030 --> 00:42:03.310 align:middle line:84%
For remember, stubbornness
is an act of pain.

00:42:03.310 --> 00:42:04.980 align:middle line:84%
It is not an act
of belligerence,

00:42:04.980 --> 00:42:06.790 align:middle line:84%
as many humans would
like to see it.

00:42:06.790 --> 00:42:08.280 align:middle line:90%
It is an act of pain.

00:42:08.280 --> 00:42:11.610 align:middle line:84%
So those who have and what
we would call enormous energy

00:42:11.610 --> 00:42:14.836 align:middle line:84%
width are dispatched
to those people.

00:42:14.836 --> 00:42:16.210 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Oh,
that's fascinating,

00:42:16.210 --> 00:42:19.960 align:middle line:90%
and it makes perfect sense.

00:42:19.960 --> 00:42:21.630 align:middle line:84%
Because of that
level of patience,

00:42:21.630 --> 00:42:23.800 align:middle line:84%
sometimes we as
humans will think,

00:42:23.800 --> 00:42:25.490 align:middle line:84%
oh God, it must
be so frustrating

00:42:25.490 --> 00:42:28.430 align:middle line:84%
trying to work with
us, with this species,

00:42:28.430 --> 00:42:30.410 align:middle line:90%
because we're moving too fast.

00:42:30.410 --> 00:42:32.887 align:middle line:90%
We're distracted all the time.

00:42:32.887 --> 00:42:34.970 align:middle line:84%
But that's not how it's
viewed from where you are.

00:42:34.970 --> 00:42:35.803 align:middle line:90%
>>HARRIS: It is not.

00:42:35.803 --> 00:42:39.490 align:middle line:84%
And we hear a lot of negative
ideas about your time.

00:42:39.490 --> 00:42:41.974 align:middle line:84%
There is a lot of
negativity about technology.

00:42:41.974 --> 00:42:43.640 align:middle line:84%
There are many people
saying that people

00:42:43.640 --> 00:42:46.000 align:middle line:84%
are becoming desocialized
because of technology.

00:42:46.000 --> 00:42:47.920 align:middle line:84%
We would argue that
is not the truth.

00:42:47.920 --> 00:42:49.600 align:middle line:84%
In fact, technology
has paved the way

00:42:49.600 --> 00:42:51.260 align:middle line:90%
for extraordinary advances.

00:42:51.260 --> 00:42:54.560 align:middle line:84%
But like anything, you
must check yourself.

00:42:54.560 --> 00:42:57.640 align:middle line:84%
You must decide, have you
been on your phone all day

00:42:57.640 --> 00:42:58.480 align:middle line:90%
without a break?

00:42:58.480 --> 00:42:59.320 align:middle line:90%
Or have you not?

00:42:59.320 --> 00:43:00.820 align:middle line:90%
You cannot blame the phone.

00:43:00.820 --> 00:43:02.380 align:middle line:84%
That is like blaming
the substance

00:43:02.380 --> 00:43:04.120 align:middle line:90%
for someone's addiction.

00:43:04.120 --> 00:43:07.090 align:middle line:84%
So what we would say regarding
this is the reason people feel

00:43:07.090 --> 00:43:10.360 align:middle line:84%
so isolated and the reason
that people are so in pain

00:43:10.360 --> 00:43:12.160 align:middle line:84%
is because of the
fragmented humanity

00:43:12.160 --> 00:43:13.910 align:middle line:90%
that they are existing in.

00:43:13.910 --> 00:43:18.400 align:middle line:84%
Humanity has been designed
to connect and to be a tribe.

00:43:18.400 --> 00:43:20.970 align:middle line:84%
And yet through the
evolution process

00:43:20.970 --> 00:43:24.640 align:middle line:84%
and through the control of
certain forces-- you would

00:43:24.640 --> 00:43:26.330 align:middle line:84%
you call them
government, although we

00:43:26.330 --> 00:43:29.050 align:middle line:84%
would argue that what you see
presented as your government is

00:43:29.050 --> 00:43:31.180 align:middle line:90%
not actually the government.

00:43:31.180 --> 00:43:35.200 align:middle line:84%
It is the display people
for the government.

00:43:35.200 --> 00:43:39.650 align:middle line:84%
Through many archaic
and quite divisive ideas

00:43:39.650 --> 00:43:42.570 align:middle line:84%
and manipulations,
people have been divided.

00:43:42.570 --> 00:43:45.040 align:middle line:84%
And yet, you cannot
fight the tide.

00:43:45.040 --> 00:43:47.500 align:middle line:84%
And the tide of consciousness
has been rising now

00:43:47.500 --> 00:43:50.800 align:middle line:84%
in a very strong way for
the last 30 to 40 years

00:43:50.800 --> 00:43:52.780 align:middle line:90%
in bigger ways than ever before.

00:43:52.780 --> 00:43:54.500 align:middle line:84%
And so what people
are beginning to do

00:43:54.500 --> 00:43:56.190 align:middle line:90%
is find ways to come together.

00:43:56.190 --> 00:43:58.560 align:middle line:84%
So if people are
isolated, it is often not

00:43:58.560 --> 00:44:01.010 align:middle line:84%
because they have lost their
connection with the divine.

00:44:01.010 --> 00:44:02.635 align:middle line:84%
Because they have
lost their connection

00:44:02.635 --> 00:44:04.540 align:middle line:84%
with the divine in
the other humans,

00:44:04.540 --> 00:44:07.090 align:middle line:84%
seeing that somebody
else might need

00:44:07.090 --> 00:44:10.140 align:middle line:84%
you to lead in a moment of
conversation or intimacy,

00:44:10.140 --> 00:44:12.050 align:middle line:84%
but that then they
will join you.

00:44:12.050 --> 00:44:14.080 align:middle line:84%
This is what is
needed on Earth now,

00:44:14.080 --> 00:44:17.580 align:middle line:84%
or what Lee referred to earlier,
this horizontal and vertical.

00:44:17.580 --> 00:44:20.200 align:middle line:84%
The vertical is doing
very well on Earth.

00:44:20.200 --> 00:44:23.010 align:middle line:84%
The horizontal and the
ruptures within the horizontal

00:44:23.010 --> 00:44:25.940 align:middle line:84%
relationships are a
need, for the more

00:44:25.940 --> 00:44:29.060 align:middle line:84%
the horizontal ruptures get
repaired, the more people who

00:44:29.060 --> 00:44:31.360 align:middle line:84%
are feeling connected to
others and finding ways

00:44:31.360 --> 00:44:33.790 align:middle line:84%
to connect with others
and being patient

00:44:33.790 --> 00:44:35.820 align:middle line:84%
about finding ways to
connect with others,

00:44:35.820 --> 00:44:37.060 align:middle line:90%
the more the vertical grows.

00:44:37.060 --> 00:44:40.100 align:middle line:90%


00:44:40.100 --> 00:44:42.830 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: There was a
loaded point that you just

00:44:42.830 --> 00:44:45.370 align:middle line:84%
made a moment ago, which
of course a lot of people

00:44:45.370 --> 00:44:46.930 align:middle line:84%
go toward, but I
think it's important

00:44:46.930 --> 00:44:49.010 align:middle line:84%
not to ignore the
existence of, which

00:44:49.010 --> 00:44:51.810 align:middle line:84%
is, you say the people we
consider to be government

00:44:51.810 --> 00:44:54.040 align:middle line:84%
are simply faces
for the government.

00:44:54.040 --> 00:44:56.960 align:middle line:84%
And so what is your
exact description

00:44:56.960 --> 00:45:00.690 align:middle line:84%
when you're saying for the
government, the forces that

00:45:00.690 --> 00:45:02.060 align:middle line:90%
control?

00:45:02.060 --> 00:45:05.930 align:middle line:84%
>>HARRIS: We would say that
this is clear everywhere you go,

00:45:05.930 --> 00:45:09.510 align:middle line:84%
as in often what you perceive
as the person in charge

00:45:09.510 --> 00:45:10.890 align:middle line:90%
is not in charge.

00:45:10.890 --> 00:45:12.880 align:middle line:84%
So a good example
we can give you

00:45:12.880 --> 00:45:16.310 align:middle line:84%
is-- a person who is working
in a department store

00:45:16.310 --> 00:45:17.781 align:middle line:90%
will talk about their boss.

00:45:17.781 --> 00:45:19.530 align:middle line:84%
And they will focus
all of their attention

00:45:19.530 --> 00:45:21.550 align:middle line:84%
on their boss, the person
directly above them.

00:45:21.550 --> 00:45:22.930 align:middle line:84%
Because that is the
way that they are

00:45:22.930 --> 00:45:24.120 align:middle line:90%
perceiving the relationship.

00:45:24.120 --> 00:45:26.780 align:middle line:84%
But of course, the boss has a
boss, and the boss has a boss,

00:45:26.780 --> 00:45:27.970 align:middle line:90%
and the boss has a boss.

00:45:27.970 --> 00:45:29.870 align:middle line:90%
It keeps going back.

00:45:29.870 --> 00:45:33.200 align:middle line:84%
No one in humanity,
until this last 30 or 40

00:45:33.200 --> 00:45:35.080 align:middle line:84%
years on a mass
level, has started

00:45:35.080 --> 00:45:37.770 align:middle line:84%
to question the
governing forces.

00:45:37.770 --> 00:45:41.260 align:middle line:84%
We have to be careful here, for
we do not want everybody to go

00:45:41.260 --> 00:45:42.970 align:middle line:90%
down the road that some have.

00:45:42.970 --> 00:45:46.740 align:middle line:84%
Some people are highly anti
any idea of government,

00:45:46.740 --> 00:45:48.670 align:middle line:84%
and we would say that
your collective is not

00:45:48.670 --> 00:45:50.482 align:middle line:84%
ready for
self-governship, either.

00:45:50.482 --> 00:45:52.190 align:middle line:84%
At this point, if
there was no government

00:45:52.190 --> 00:45:53.606 align:middle line:84%
and it was left
to the people, you

00:45:53.606 --> 00:45:56.420 align:middle line:84%
would see just as much chaos
and drama and pain-raining

00:45:56.420 --> 00:45:58.050 align:middle line:90%
as if there was no government.

00:45:58.050 --> 00:45:59.750 align:middle line:84%
But what is slowly
becoming clear,

00:45:59.750 --> 00:46:02.370 align:middle line:84%
even to those who are in
the government-- and this

00:46:02.370 --> 00:46:04.890 align:middle line:84%
is why we must speak
on the defense of many

00:46:04.890 --> 00:46:08.210 align:middle line:84%
of your governing body,
for not all in government

00:46:08.210 --> 00:46:11.040 align:middle line:84%
are as asleep or as
uncompassionate as some of you

00:46:11.040 --> 00:46:12.190 align:middle line:90%
would like to believe.

00:46:12.190 --> 00:46:15.310 align:middle line:84%
And if you pay attention
to some of the more,

00:46:15.310 --> 00:46:18.700 align:middle line:84%
shall we say, unfiltered
news channels recently,

00:46:18.700 --> 00:46:22.150 align:middle line:84%
you will notice incredible acts
of political bravery happening

00:46:22.150 --> 00:46:23.510 align:middle line:90%
from within government.

00:46:23.510 --> 00:46:25.690 align:middle line:84%
People are speaking
up with compassion

00:46:25.690 --> 00:46:27.170 align:middle line:90%
on behalf of the people.

00:46:27.170 --> 00:46:29.390 align:middle line:84%
Now, this is not some
of the big players,

00:46:29.390 --> 00:46:31.010 align:middle line:84%
for they are in
precarious positions,

00:46:31.010 --> 00:46:33.170 align:middle line:84%
for they are answering
to their direct boss.

00:46:33.170 --> 00:46:36.400 align:middle line:84%
And some of them are not even
conscious what they are doing.

00:46:36.400 --> 00:46:39.470 align:middle line:90%
They are simply 'yes people'.

00:46:39.470 --> 00:46:41.910 align:middle line:84%
So when we say there
are governing bodies

00:46:41.910 --> 00:46:44.700 align:middle line:84%
behind your government,
we mean exactly that.

00:46:44.700 --> 00:46:47.490 align:middle line:84%
There are people who have
a certain amount of control

00:46:47.490 --> 00:46:50.450 align:middle line:84%
regarding the resources and
the freedoms on this planet,

00:46:50.450 --> 00:46:53.590 align:middle line:84%
and some of those people-- not
all, but some of those people--

00:46:53.590 --> 00:46:54.930 align:middle line:90%
have very dark agendas.

00:46:54.930 --> 00:46:59.690 align:middle line:84%
And the dark agendas do
not need to be held in many

00:46:59.690 --> 00:47:01.220 align:middle line:90%
for a ripple effect to be felt.

00:47:01.220 --> 00:47:04.380 align:middle line:84%
But what we will tell you
is that those dark agendas

00:47:04.380 --> 00:47:06.600 align:middle line:84%
are crumbling from the
inside and have been

00:47:06.600 --> 00:47:08.260 align:middle line:90%
for the past several years.

00:47:08.260 --> 00:47:10.310 align:middle line:84%
So even as darker
actions are tried

00:47:10.310 --> 00:47:15.450 align:middle line:84%
to be achieved on this
planet, they are being,

00:47:15.450 --> 00:47:17.660 align:middle line:84%
shall we say, dismantled
energetically from forces

00:47:17.660 --> 00:47:19.690 align:middle line:90%
that none of you can see.

00:47:19.690 --> 00:47:21.870 align:middle line:84%
For the wave of
consciousness and the growth

00:47:21.870 --> 00:47:24.670 align:middle line:84%
of what you referred to as
the Golden Age on this planet

00:47:24.670 --> 00:47:26.270 align:middle line:90%
has to come to pass.

00:47:26.270 --> 00:47:28.090 align:middle line:90%
There is no way around it.

00:47:28.090 --> 00:47:30.150 align:middle line:84%
But for many of
you at the bottom

00:47:30.150 --> 00:47:33.020 align:middle line:84%
looking up at what you
see as just the government

00:47:33.020 --> 00:47:35.370 align:middle line:84%
and looked around at what
you're seeing going on,

00:47:35.370 --> 00:47:37.440 align:middle line:90%
it can seem very distressing.

00:47:37.440 --> 00:47:40.840 align:middle line:84%
And what we will say is that in
these microcosmic distressing

00:47:40.840 --> 00:47:43.210 align:middle line:84%
moments that you
focus on, many of you

00:47:43.210 --> 00:47:45.810 align:middle line:84%
are healing past
life incidences.

00:47:45.810 --> 00:47:47.600 align:middle line:84%
So for example,
if you are focused

00:47:47.600 --> 00:47:49.280 align:middle line:84%
on a war in a
particular country,

00:47:49.280 --> 00:47:51.970 align:middle line:84%
and it is devastating to you
personally and emotionally,

00:47:51.970 --> 00:47:54.090 align:middle line:84%
you are clearing out
some of that density

00:47:54.090 --> 00:47:56.850 align:middle line:84%
in your own field that
remembers being in a war

00:47:56.850 --> 00:47:59.600 align:middle line:84%
just like that at a
previous time on Earth.

00:47:59.600 --> 00:48:01.680 align:middle line:90%
So it is a very intense process.

00:48:01.680 --> 00:48:04.040 align:middle line:84%
It is not something
that you simply observe.

00:48:04.040 --> 00:48:05.990 align:middle line:84%
It is something
you also all feel,

00:48:05.990 --> 00:48:09.100 align:middle line:84%
for in feeling it together,
you will transmute it.

00:48:09.100 --> 00:48:11.120 align:middle line:84%
That is why compassion
is so important

00:48:11.120 --> 00:48:14.020 align:middle line:84%
to develop on this planet
as a spiritual practice,

00:48:14.020 --> 00:48:17.460 align:middle line:84%
to learn to love another
despite their behavior.

00:48:17.460 --> 00:48:18.480 align:middle line:90%
Yes, there is a line.

00:48:18.480 --> 00:48:21.150 align:middle line:84%
If you see somebody
repeatedly murdering somebody,

00:48:21.150 --> 00:48:23.770 align:middle line:84%
you may want to feel very
differently about them

00:48:23.770 --> 00:48:25.380 align:middle line:90%
to another neighbor.

00:48:25.380 --> 00:48:27.900 align:middle line:84%
But you understand what
we are driving at here.

00:48:27.900 --> 00:48:30.480 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: I do, and thank you
very much for that perspective.

00:48:30.480 --> 00:48:34.100 align:middle line:84%
That is what I perceive, is
that there are the forces

00:48:34.100 --> 00:48:36.930 align:middle line:84%
that we're not aware of
that are unseen that may

00:48:36.930 --> 00:48:38.610 align:middle line:90%
be driving some darker agendas.

00:48:38.610 --> 00:48:43.690 align:middle line:84%
But I am seeing
these acts of grace

00:48:43.690 --> 00:48:45.690 align:middle line:84%
and bravery coming
from the places

00:48:45.690 --> 00:48:48.060 align:middle line:84%
that we're the
most suspicious of.

00:48:48.060 --> 00:48:49.880 align:middle line:84%
And is this happening
across the board,

00:48:49.880 --> 00:48:54.300 align:middle line:84%
beyond governments, into
medicine and systems of money

00:48:54.300 --> 00:48:55.225 align:middle line:90%
and all of it?

00:48:55.225 --> 00:48:57.380 align:middle line:84%
Are all of these
now being permeated

00:48:57.380 --> 00:48:59.570 align:middle line:84%
with brave souls who
are coming forward

00:48:59.570 --> 00:49:00.880 align:middle line:90%
in the transformation process?

00:49:00.880 --> 00:49:02.390 align:middle line:84%
>>HARRIS: It is a
twofold process.

00:49:02.390 --> 00:49:04.000 align:middle line:84%
It is the voice
of your collective

00:49:04.000 --> 00:49:07.240 align:middle line:84%
speaking out against what
they are seeing as no good.

00:49:07.240 --> 00:49:10.650 align:middle line:84%
And that energy and that voice
ricochets into those areas

00:49:10.650 --> 00:49:13.050 align:middle line:84%
and activates the people
working in those areas who

00:49:13.050 --> 00:49:14.950 align:middle line:90%
perhaps hadn't seen it.

00:49:14.950 --> 00:49:16.150 align:middle line:90%
And then they see it.

00:49:16.150 --> 00:49:18.080 align:middle line:84%
So you see, you're
all working together,

00:49:18.080 --> 00:49:21.110 align:middle line:84%
whether you are a
mother of four who

00:49:21.110 --> 00:49:23.460 align:middle line:84%
has a job to keep
her family alive

00:49:23.460 --> 00:49:26.370 align:middle line:84%
or whether you are a
governor in government.

00:49:26.370 --> 00:49:29.420 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And yet at the
same time, of course,

00:49:29.420 --> 00:49:32.820 align:middle line:84%
the news, highly
manufactured media,

00:49:32.820 --> 00:49:36.510 align:middle line:84%
is still constantly
reminding us of sabres

00:49:36.510 --> 00:49:39.810 align:middle line:84%
being rattled around the
world trying to promote war.

00:49:39.810 --> 00:49:43.029 align:middle line:84%
This dominates our
public discourse.

00:49:43.029 --> 00:49:44.570 align:middle line:84%
>>HARRIS: Of course,
because you see,

00:49:44.570 --> 00:49:47.140 align:middle line:84%
if you get the collective
to focus on that,

00:49:47.140 --> 00:49:48.650 align:middle line:84%
that is what they
will start seeing.

00:49:48.650 --> 00:49:51.066 align:middle line:84%
And if they start seeing that
potential and enough of them

00:49:51.066 --> 00:49:52.920 align:middle line:84%
see that potential
and enough of them

00:49:52.920 --> 00:49:55.440 align:middle line:84%
have the energy of
fear behind it, which

00:49:55.440 --> 00:49:57.240 align:middle line:84%
alchemizes their
vision, they will

00:49:57.240 --> 00:49:58.890 align:middle line:90%
help to bring it into bear.

00:49:58.890 --> 00:50:01.710 align:middle line:84%
So you see, what we
will tell you is this.

00:50:01.710 --> 00:50:04.240 align:middle line:84%
Many times, half of the
things-- in fact, more than half

00:50:04.240 --> 00:50:05.830 align:middle line:84%
of the things that
you are told--

00:50:05.830 --> 00:50:07.840 align:middle line:90%
are not on the slate at all.

00:50:07.840 --> 00:50:09.890 align:middle line:84%
But they are what somebody
would like to create.

00:50:09.890 --> 00:50:12.590 align:middle line:84%
So if they dangle that
carrot in front of the public

00:50:12.590 --> 00:50:14.770 align:middle line:84%
and get enough fuel
behind that fire,

00:50:14.770 --> 00:50:16.180 align:middle line:90%
they might be able to create it.

00:50:16.180 --> 00:50:19.420 align:middle line:84%
But even that method
is losing power.

00:50:19.420 --> 00:50:21.060 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: That is
beautiful to hear.

00:50:21.060 --> 00:50:24.220 align:middle line:84%
And the more we simply turn
away from these messages

00:50:24.220 --> 00:50:27.800 align:middle line:84%
and don't give them any energy,
the more quickly, I assume,

00:50:27.800 --> 00:50:30.602 align:middle line:84%
these kinds of agendas
will start falling away?

00:50:30.602 --> 00:50:31.560 align:middle line:90%
>>HARRIS: This is true.

00:50:31.560 --> 00:50:33.600 align:middle line:84%
And for many of you, it
has been the shamanic

00:50:33.600 --> 00:50:35.960 align:middle line:84%
flush through your bodies
of your associations

00:50:35.960 --> 00:50:37.950 align:middle line:84%
with those energies
from times past.

00:50:37.950 --> 00:50:41.180 align:middle line:84%
So some of you have gone
through almighty fear moments.

00:50:41.180 --> 00:50:44.200 align:middle line:84%
The important thing for those
of you going through these,

00:50:44.200 --> 00:50:46.800 align:middle line:84%
what we would call 'fear
shakedowns' in your body

00:50:46.800 --> 00:50:49.450 align:middle line:84%
in resonance with something
that you see as a potential,

00:50:49.450 --> 00:50:53.130 align:middle line:84%
is to own that as your own fear,
to not confuse it and believe

00:50:53.130 --> 00:50:54.650 align:middle line:84%
you are actually
seeing the future,

00:50:54.650 --> 00:50:57.680 align:middle line:84%
which is what happens to
a great many visionaries.

00:50:57.680 --> 00:50:58.920 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Very good point.

00:50:58.920 --> 00:51:01.390 align:middle line:84%
Thank you for making
that distinction.

00:51:01.390 --> 00:51:04.560 align:middle line:84%
One thing I want to ask
you about also, going back

00:51:04.560 --> 00:51:07.640 align:middle line:84%
to the notion of our beings
interdimensionally or otherwise

00:51:07.640 --> 00:51:10.840 align:middle line:84%
working with us, one
of many of, as you say,

00:51:10.840 --> 00:51:13.510 align:middle line:84%
thousands of different kinds
of beings working with us,

00:51:13.510 --> 00:51:17.260 align:middle line:84%
are what appear to be
accidents sometimes used

00:51:17.260 --> 00:51:20.020 align:middle line:84%
in the process of
getting our attention.

00:51:20.020 --> 00:51:21.740 align:middle line:84%
>>HARRIS: Accidents
on the physical?

00:51:21.740 --> 00:51:23.830 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Yes, in
the physical world.

00:51:23.830 --> 00:51:25.850 align:middle line:84%
>>HARRIS: We would say
accidents on the physical

00:51:25.850 --> 00:51:29.760 align:middle line:84%
are also good mirrors, as
suddenly being what you would

00:51:29.760 --> 00:51:33.580 align:middle line:84%
call dumped by a lover that you
thought it was all going well

00:51:33.580 --> 00:51:34.270 align:middle line:90%
with.

00:51:34.270 --> 00:51:36.440 align:middle line:84%
So there are accidents
that occur in the physical

00:51:36.440 --> 00:51:38.720 align:middle line:84%
to shock you, and
there are "accidents,"

00:51:38.720 --> 00:51:41.790 align:middle line:84%
in quote marks, to
occur on the emotional

00:51:41.790 --> 00:51:43.790 align:middle line:84%
and the relational
levels to shock you,

00:51:43.790 --> 00:51:46.960 align:middle line:84%
such as suddenly losing a
job you had no awareness you

00:51:46.960 --> 00:51:48.310 align:middle line:90%
were going to lose.

00:51:48.310 --> 00:51:51.770 align:middle line:84%
So all of these are
attention-grabbing to those

00:51:51.770 --> 00:51:53.790 align:middle line:84%
who perhaps were
living on a pattern.

00:51:53.790 --> 00:51:55.810 align:middle line:84%
But to those who are
living in the now

00:51:55.810 --> 00:51:57.870 align:middle line:84%
with not a great
deal of attachment

00:51:57.870 --> 00:52:01.340 align:middle line:84%
to the future or the past
or the present in the way

00:52:01.340 --> 00:52:03.660 align:middle line:84%
that others have it,
it is the beginning

00:52:03.660 --> 00:52:06.950 align:middle line:84%
of a whole new chapter and
something to be interested in,

00:52:06.950 --> 00:52:09.560 align:middle line:84%
both their reaction to
it and then their way

00:52:09.560 --> 00:52:12.360 align:middle line:84%
of moving through it
and going forward.

00:52:12.360 --> 00:52:13.790 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes, thank you.

00:52:13.790 --> 00:52:17.550 align:middle line:84%
And as we come towards the
end of our conversation,

00:52:17.550 --> 00:52:19.490 align:middle line:84%
this morning as I woke
up, I was thinking

00:52:19.490 --> 00:52:22.490 align:middle line:84%
about this aspect of humanity
that we're waking to.

00:52:22.490 --> 00:52:27.370 align:middle line:84%
You have used the word
returning to a Golden Age.

00:52:27.370 --> 00:52:31.780 align:middle line:84%
And what I was looking at
or feeling, experiencing,

00:52:31.780 --> 00:52:36.030 align:middle line:84%
was that the path
back seems to be

00:52:36.030 --> 00:52:40.600 align:middle line:84%
one that has beauty,
whatever beauty means,

00:52:40.600 --> 00:52:44.150 align:middle line:84%
beauty, grace,
elevated frequencies,

00:52:44.150 --> 00:52:47.880 align:middle line:84%
refinement on whatever our level
or definition of refinement

00:52:47.880 --> 00:52:49.270 align:middle line:90%
means.

00:52:49.270 --> 00:52:53.290 align:middle line:84%
I was seeing that that is one
of the most expeditious paths

00:52:53.290 --> 00:52:57.780 align:middle line:84%
back to ourselves, that
divine aspect of self.

00:52:57.780 --> 00:52:58.630 align:middle line:90%
What do you see?

00:52:58.630 --> 00:53:02.030 align:middle line:84%
>>HARRIS: This a good
way of describing

00:53:02.030 --> 00:53:06.320 align:middle line:84%
the sensory, for a sensory being
will see beauty everywhere.

00:53:06.320 --> 00:53:09.560 align:middle line:84%
There are some what you might
call more mathematically minded

00:53:09.560 --> 00:53:12.770 align:middle line:84%
people who can appreciate
a painting's composition.

00:53:12.770 --> 00:53:15.250 align:middle line:84%
But even that for them
is an appreciation

00:53:15.250 --> 00:53:17.170 align:middle line:90%
of structure and symmetry.

00:53:17.170 --> 00:53:19.880 align:middle line:84%
That is slightly different
to the sensory experience

00:53:19.880 --> 00:53:23.650 align:middle line:84%
of beauty, for beauty affects
your heart, not just your mind.

00:53:23.650 --> 00:53:26.970 align:middle line:84%
It hits the heart, and
part of you all exhales.

00:53:26.970 --> 00:53:30.170 align:middle line:84%
[EXHALES] That is beauty,
whether that beauty is

00:53:30.170 --> 00:53:32.540 align:middle line:84%
seen in another person
or whether that beauty is

00:53:32.540 --> 00:53:35.380 align:middle line:84%
seen in another form or
whether that beauty is simply

00:53:35.380 --> 00:53:37.630 align:middle line:84%
experienced in the
sensory and meditation

00:53:37.630 --> 00:53:39.710 align:middle line:90%
that you have that morning.

00:53:39.710 --> 00:53:42.720 align:middle line:84%
So what we would say is the
sensory is returning to Earth.

00:53:42.720 --> 00:53:45.180 align:middle line:84%
And that is what the
Golden Age refers to.

00:53:45.180 --> 00:53:48.490 align:middle line:84%
Atlantis had a great deal
of golden energy around it.

00:53:48.490 --> 00:53:51.660 align:middle line:84%
Energies that can be
seen by energy seers,

00:53:51.660 --> 00:53:53.440 align:middle line:84%
they will notice
that gold is coming

00:53:53.440 --> 00:53:55.720 align:middle line:84%
to the Earth a great
deal more in the colors

00:53:55.720 --> 00:53:57.540 align:middle line:84%
that they are seeing
in the auras now.

00:53:57.540 --> 00:53:59.870 align:middle line:90%
And that gold is alchemical.

00:53:59.870 --> 00:54:02.900 align:middle line:84%
Gold is highly abundant,
for through gold,

00:54:02.900 --> 00:54:04.580 align:middle line:90%
everything can filter.

00:54:04.580 --> 00:54:06.530 align:middle line:84%
So when everything
can filter, it

00:54:06.530 --> 00:54:09.110 align:middle line:84%
means that the
limitless potential

00:54:09.110 --> 00:54:11.730 align:middle line:84%
of what you want to
create becomes open to you

00:54:11.730 --> 00:54:12.900 align:middle line:90%
all as beings.

00:54:12.900 --> 00:54:15.460 align:middle line:84%
So in the Golden Age,
there is more opening.

00:54:15.460 --> 00:54:18.010 align:middle line:84%
And that opening can
come for all of you

00:54:18.010 --> 00:54:21.770 align:middle line:84%
from each of you individually
agreeing to open your senses.

00:54:21.770 --> 00:54:25.170 align:middle line:84%
You already have open
minds, open achieve-minds,

00:54:25.170 --> 00:54:27.080 align:middle line:90%
open we-must-do.

00:54:27.080 --> 00:54:28.390 align:middle line:90%
We must accumulate.

00:54:28.390 --> 00:54:31.030 align:middle line:84%
We must win the
race, make the money.

00:54:31.030 --> 00:54:34.180 align:middle line:84%
Yes, all of those things do
not have to be killed off.

00:54:34.180 --> 00:54:36.260 align:middle line:84%
But they will kill
you off if you do not

00:54:36.260 --> 00:54:39.750 align:middle line:84%
open your sensory hearts
and experiences to the Earth

00:54:39.750 --> 00:54:40.980 align:middle line:90%
now as well.

00:54:40.980 --> 00:54:44.660 align:middle line:84%
And those people who are feeling
lost and empty in their lives,

00:54:44.660 --> 00:54:46.580 align:middle line:90%
the place to go is the sensory.

00:54:46.580 --> 00:54:49.110 align:middle line:84%
And not only will you then
experience the beauty,

00:54:49.110 --> 00:54:51.460 align:middle line:90%
but you will create the beauty.

00:54:51.460 --> 00:54:52.960 align:middle line:90%
Think of energetics.

00:54:52.960 --> 00:54:57.150 align:middle line:84%
If you, Regina, had a member
of your team in your office,

00:54:57.150 --> 00:55:00.730 align:middle line:84%
and they had made a mistake
on one of these television

00:55:00.730 --> 00:55:03.910 align:middle line:84%
shows that you are doing, there
are two ways you can play it.

00:55:03.910 --> 00:55:05.650 align:middle line:84%
You can come down
hard on them and make

00:55:05.650 --> 00:55:07.750 align:middle line:84%
them feel small and
bad, and they leave

00:55:07.750 --> 00:55:09.590 align:middle line:90%
the office in a not-good space.

00:55:09.590 --> 00:55:12.870 align:middle line:84%
Or you can say to them,
ha, well, mistakes happen.

00:55:12.870 --> 00:55:13.660 align:middle line:90%
It's OK.

00:55:13.660 --> 00:55:16.210 align:middle line:84%
And we'll just remember
it for next time.

00:55:16.210 --> 00:55:18.300 align:middle line:84%
The second is an
experience of beauty.

00:55:18.300 --> 00:55:20.960 align:middle line:84%
The first is an experience
of the old world.

00:55:20.960 --> 00:55:24.200 align:middle line:84%
So as more and more of you are
willing to bring the beauty

00:55:24.200 --> 00:55:27.830 align:middle line:84%
into your lives no matter what
the challenge or the difficulty

00:55:27.830 --> 00:55:31.290 align:middle line:84%
that day is, to remember that
the beauty can be accessed

00:55:31.290 --> 00:55:34.370 align:middle line:84%
at any time on a day, we
have said this before,

00:55:34.370 --> 00:55:37.420 align:middle line:84%
but it doesn't matter how
difficult your day has been,

00:55:37.420 --> 00:55:40.560 align:middle line:84%
you can always
access some beauty,

00:55:40.560 --> 00:55:43.930 align:middle line:84%
some magic in the final hour
of it and remember that.

00:55:43.930 --> 00:55:46.110 align:middle line:84%
And that will allow
you to open to it.

00:55:46.110 --> 00:55:48.560 align:middle line:84%
That opening is very
much the opening

00:55:48.560 --> 00:55:52.200 align:middle line:84%
that humanity is now creating
in itself as a collective.

00:55:52.200 --> 00:55:56.390 align:middle line:84%
With certain leaders, yes,
but as a group, all of you

00:55:56.390 --> 00:55:59.840 align:middle line:84%
are beginning to become more
alive and more activated

00:55:59.840 --> 00:56:01.850 align:middle line:90%
to that potential.

00:56:01.850 --> 00:56:05.530 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Yes, and thank you for
explaining it so beautifully.

00:56:05.530 --> 00:56:07.770 align:middle line:84%
And with that, I believe
our time together

00:56:07.770 --> 00:56:09.620 align:middle line:84%
is finished, for
this time, anyway.

00:56:09.620 --> 00:56:11.720 align:middle line:84%
And I want to thank you
on behalf of all of us

00:56:11.720 --> 00:56:14.240 align:middle line:84%
and everyone watching
this so much for bringing

00:56:14.240 --> 00:56:16.829 align:middle line:84%
your profound viewpoints
and wisdom to us.

00:56:16.829 --> 00:56:17.370 align:middle line:90%
>>HARRIS: Ha.

00:56:17.370 --> 00:56:18.550 align:middle line:90%
You do not need to thank us.

00:56:18.550 --> 00:56:21.730 align:middle line:84%
We thank you, for you all
created this conversation.

00:56:21.730 --> 00:56:25.340 align:middle line:84%
We simply showed up to say what
it was you wanted us to say.

00:56:25.340 --> 00:56:26.340 align:middle line:90%
That is all.

00:56:26.340 --> 00:56:29.502 align:middle line:84%
So, in peace and in
love to you and to all.

00:56:29.502 --> 00:56:30.486 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Thank you.

00:56:30.486 --> 00:56:40.330 align:middle line:90%
>>HARRIS: [BREATHES DEEPLY] Hi.

00:56:40.330 --> 00:56:41.380 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Hi.

00:56:41.380 --> 00:56:43.750 align:middle line:90%
That was a lovely conversation.

00:56:43.750 --> 00:56:45.700 align:middle line:84%
You probably don't
remember much of it.

00:56:45.700 --> 00:56:47.017 align:middle line:90%
>>HARRIS: The last few minutes.

00:56:47.017 --> 00:56:48.850 align:middle line:84%
[LAUGHS] I don't remember
earlier than that.

00:56:48.850 --> 00:56:53.490 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Yes, the whole notion
of grace and beauty, whatever

00:56:53.490 --> 00:56:56.730 align:middle line:84%
that means to the person, that
feeling of that, as they say,

00:56:56.730 --> 00:56:58.550 align:middle line:90%
beautiful golden upliftment.

00:56:58.550 --> 00:57:00.217 align:middle line:84%
>>HARRIS: Mmm, that made sense
to me, yes, as I heard it.

00:57:00.217 --> 00:57:00.420 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

00:57:00.420 --> 00:57:00.970 align:middle line:90%
That made sense.

00:57:00.970 --> 00:57:03.178 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Yes, and I loved
the way they explained it,

00:57:03.178 --> 00:57:07.300 align:middle line:84%
because it seems to me that's
our e-ticket, our e-ticket back

00:57:07.300 --> 00:57:10.490 align:middle line:84%
to self, back to the
all, the connection.

00:57:10.490 --> 00:57:14.020 align:middle line:84%
Anyway, we literally have
gone through an hour.

00:57:14.020 --> 00:57:16.770 align:middle line:84%
And I want to thank you so
much for you showing up, body

00:57:16.770 --> 00:57:21.350 align:middle line:84%
and mind and soul, and for being
the vehicle to these beings who

00:57:21.350 --> 00:57:23.324 align:middle line:84%
are happy to work in
