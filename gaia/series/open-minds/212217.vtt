00:00:16.128 --> 00:00:18.670 align:middle line:10%
>> REGINA MEREDITH: Christopher
Bache is a hero for our times

00:00:18.670 --> 00:00:19.720 align:middle line:10%
in my humble opinion.

00:00:19.720 --> 00:00:21.370 align:middle line:10%
I don't think he intended to be.

00:00:21.370 --> 00:00:24.070 align:middle line:10%
But his persistence
and courage in seeking

00:00:24.070 --> 00:00:26.080 align:middle line:10%
to know the
unknowable has left us

00:00:26.080 --> 00:00:28.870 align:middle line:10%
with the documentation of
the mind of the universe,

00:00:28.870 --> 00:00:30.910 align:middle line:10%
at least as best
as any human being

00:00:30.910 --> 00:00:32.980 align:middle line:10%
could possibly articulate it.

00:00:32.980 --> 00:00:34.480 align:middle line:90%
Welcome, Christopher.

00:00:34.480 --> 00:00:35.178 align:middle line:84%
>> CHRISTOPHER BACHE:
Thank you, Regina.

00:00:35.178 --> 00:00:35.410 align:middle line:90%
Pleasure to be here.

00:00:35.410 --> 00:00:36.980 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: It's so good
to see you in the flesh.

00:00:36.980 --> 00:00:38.688 align:middle line:84%
I've interviewed you
on my site and we've

00:00:38.688 --> 00:00:40.990 align:middle line:84%
had a book club over
your book, and now it's

00:00:40.990 --> 00:00:44.560 align:middle line:84%
time for the Gaia audience to
learn about you and your work.

00:00:44.560 --> 00:00:47.470 align:middle line:84%
And truly, eyes
don't say that, I

00:00:47.470 --> 00:00:51.250 align:middle line:84%
don't say that lightly,
but what you chose to do,

00:00:51.250 --> 00:00:53.740 align:middle line:84%
and we're going to have
you set it up for our Gaia

00:00:53.740 --> 00:00:56.980 align:middle line:84%
audience here in a minute,
is nothing short of heroic

00:00:56.980 --> 00:00:59.200 align:middle line:84%
because it took
so much diligence

00:00:59.200 --> 00:01:01.270 align:middle line:84%
and it was so
painful, and yet you

00:01:01.270 --> 00:01:04.430 align:middle line:84%
kept going back and back
because you had to know more.

00:01:04.430 --> 00:01:06.940 align:middle line:90%
So let's go ahead and set it up.

00:01:06.940 --> 00:01:10.070 align:middle line:84%
We've talked about
entheogens in the past,

00:01:10.070 --> 00:01:12.880 align:middle line:84%
we have other hosts who
do shows on entheogens.

00:01:12.880 --> 00:01:15.430 align:middle line:84%
This to me seems to be
an order of magnitude

00:01:15.430 --> 00:01:17.130 align:middle line:90%
like I've never heard before.

00:01:17.130 --> 00:01:20.570 align:middle line:84%
So let's talk about who
you were as a young man

00:01:20.570 --> 00:01:22.700 align:middle line:84%
in the beginning of
this journey using

00:01:22.700 --> 00:01:25.170 align:middle line:84%
LSD to explore the
mind of the universe.

00:01:25.170 --> 00:01:25.970 align:middle line:10%
>> BACHE: Yeah.

00:01:25.970 --> 00:01:28.100 align:middle line:10%
Well, I had just
finished graduate school.

00:01:28.100 --> 00:01:30.620 align:middle line:10%
It was 1978, a long time ago.

00:01:30.620 --> 00:01:33.080 align:middle line:10%
I met the work of
Stan Grof who had just

00:01:33.080 --> 00:01:34.920 align:middle line:10%
started publishing his books.

00:01:34.920 --> 00:01:38.370 align:middle line:10%
And I immediately
wanted to get involved.

00:01:38.370 --> 00:01:41.180 align:middle line:84%
And so long story short,
what I ended up doing

00:01:41.180 --> 00:01:45.890 align:middle line:84%
was 20 years of exploration
using high-dose LSD

00:01:45.890 --> 00:01:49.550 align:middle line:84%
sessions following the protocols
that Stan had established.

00:01:49.550 --> 00:01:53.240 align:middle line:84%
So we're talking about a
sitter very carefully arranged

00:01:53.240 --> 00:01:54.287 align:middle line:90%
privacy--

00:01:54.287 --> 00:01:55.370 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Real protocols.

00:01:55.370 --> 00:01:57.350 align:middle line:84%
>> BACHE: All standard
protocol, eyeshades,

00:01:57.350 --> 00:02:02.150 align:middle line:84%
it's totally isolating in what
I call the kiva of practice.

00:02:02.150 --> 00:02:05.660 align:middle line:84%
And then I just
basically, for me,

00:02:05.660 --> 00:02:09.800 align:middle line:84%
every session is like a deep
exploration of one's own mind

00:02:09.800 --> 00:02:12.950 align:middle line:84%
until eventually one drops
out of one's mind, drops

00:02:12.950 --> 00:02:16.040 align:middle line:84%
into the mind of the
universe and then exploring.

00:02:16.040 --> 00:02:19.340 align:middle line:84%
As a philosopher, what I
was mostly interested in

00:02:19.340 --> 00:02:21.650 align:middle line:90%
was cosmological exploration.

00:02:21.650 --> 00:02:25.130 align:middle line:84%
How far can we push
these methods to explore

00:02:25.130 --> 00:02:27.080 align:middle line:90%
the deep structure of reality?

00:02:27.080 --> 00:02:29.648 align:middle line:84%
And that's what I spent
these 20 years doing.

00:02:29.648 --> 00:02:31.940 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: Well, you were
also a professor of theology.

00:02:31.940 --> 00:02:33.900 align:middle line:90%
Were you looking for God?

00:02:33.900 --> 00:02:38.510 align:middle line:84%
>> BACHE: [LAUGHS] I started
this work as a deeply convinced

00:02:38.510 --> 00:02:39.560 align:middle line:90%
agnostic.

00:02:39.560 --> 00:02:42.510 align:middle line:84%
I had basically outgrown
religion through my studies.

00:02:42.510 --> 00:02:45.410 align:middle line:84%
And I was atheistic-inclined
to agnostic.

00:02:45.410 --> 00:02:47.480 align:middle line:84%
But then when one
begins to confront

00:02:47.480 --> 00:02:51.410 align:middle line:84%
the reality of the consciousness
of the universe, I mean,

00:02:51.410 --> 00:02:54.560 align:middle line:84%
God comes back into
the picture but not God

00:02:54.560 --> 00:02:58.190 align:middle line:84%
as we have classically
defined it, but a living

00:02:58.190 --> 00:03:02.930 align:middle line:84%
conscious reality that is
much, much larger than any

00:03:02.930 --> 00:03:05.810 align:middle line:84%
of our conventional
understandings of God.

00:03:05.810 --> 00:03:08.390 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: So now, we start at
the beginning of the journeys.

00:03:08.390 --> 00:03:13.220 align:middle line:84%
So you say in your book and
you say right off the bat,

00:03:13.220 --> 00:03:14.880 align:middle line:90%
do not do this at home.

00:03:14.880 --> 00:03:20.150 align:middle line:84%
You do not recommend people
taking those high doses of LSD

00:03:20.150 --> 00:03:21.110 align:middle line:90%
that you took.

00:03:21.110 --> 00:03:26.840 align:middle line:84%
You pushed it, you had a person,
your wife, who you trusted,

00:03:26.840 --> 00:03:29.960 align:middle line:84%
who also was a professional
in the field of psychology

00:03:29.960 --> 00:03:32.340 align:middle line:84%
that could handle
what was going on.

00:03:32.340 --> 00:03:36.680 align:middle line:84%
And so you pushed it, you
really wanted to get out there.

00:03:36.680 --> 00:03:40.340 align:middle line:84%
>> BACHE: I pushed it because
I had a number of false

00:03:40.340 --> 00:03:41.990 align:middle line:90%
assumptions at the beginning.

00:03:41.990 --> 00:03:44.930 align:middle line:84%
I thought this was about
clearing personal karma

00:03:44.930 --> 00:03:48.410 align:middle line:84%
and I knew that if I worked
with larger doses and sessions

00:03:48.410 --> 00:03:51.620 align:middle line:84%
would be more intense but I
could clear the karma faster.

00:03:51.620 --> 00:03:53.660 align:middle line:84%
What I did not
realize at the time

00:03:53.660 --> 00:03:55.670 align:middle line:84%
was that it's not
about personal karma.

00:03:55.670 --> 00:03:59.600 align:middle line:84%
It's when you work with very
high levels of any psychedelic,

00:03:59.600 --> 00:04:02.690 align:middle line:84%
you open up to vast
territories, far

00:04:02.690 --> 00:04:05.480 align:middle line:84%
beyond anything to do with
your personal landscape.

00:04:05.480 --> 00:04:11.000 align:middle line:84%
So what begins to be active is
the psyche of the human species

00:04:11.000 --> 00:04:12.320 align:middle line:90%
as a totality.

00:04:12.320 --> 00:04:14.750 align:middle line:84%
And then moving beyond
that, one enters

00:04:14.750 --> 00:04:20.029 align:middle line:84%
into levels of conscious
reality that transcend history,

00:04:20.029 --> 00:04:22.110 align:middle line:90%
transcend time.

00:04:22.110 --> 00:04:25.040 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: So now we go to the
time when you start on these

00:04:25.040 --> 00:04:28.670 align:middle line:84%
journeys and you're first
confronted with the notion

00:04:28.670 --> 00:04:32.750 align:middle line:84%
of letting go of what
is commonly called--

00:04:32.750 --> 00:04:34.970 align:middle line:84%
I wouldn't even say
classically-- commonly called

00:04:34.970 --> 00:04:37.520 align:middle line:84%
ego, which is a very
misunderstood thing

00:04:37.520 --> 00:04:38.610 align:middle line:90%
to begin with.

00:04:38.610 --> 00:04:40.340 align:middle line:84%
So I'd like to know
about the journey

00:04:40.340 --> 00:04:43.340 align:middle line:84%
and about your understanding
of what ego actually

00:04:43.340 --> 00:04:46.520 align:middle line:84%
was so we know what
happened when it was gone.

00:04:46.520 --> 00:04:47.840 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHS]

00:04:47.840 --> 00:04:52.070 align:middle line:84%
>> BACHE: Well, for me, ego is
simply our body-mind identity.

00:04:52.070 --> 00:04:53.930 align:middle line:84%
It's the unit of
consciousness that

00:04:53.930 --> 00:04:57.920 align:middle line:84%
organizes all of our time-space
experience in this incarnation.

00:04:57.920 --> 00:05:00.630 align:middle line:84%
And I think ego gets a bad rap
in the spiritual literature.

00:05:00.630 --> 00:05:01.430 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Agree.

00:05:01.430 --> 00:05:04.670 align:middle line:84%
>> BACHE: Ego is a beautiful,
beautiful phenomenon

00:05:04.670 --> 00:05:06.350 align:middle line:90%
but it's limited.

00:05:06.350 --> 00:05:08.090 align:middle line:84%
It's cut off from
other human beings.

00:05:08.090 --> 00:05:10.880 align:middle line:84%
It tends to be cut off from
the very fabric of existence

00:05:10.880 --> 00:05:11.820 align:middle line:90%
itself.

00:05:11.820 --> 00:05:14.360 align:middle line:84%
And so if you're
going to open up

00:05:14.360 --> 00:05:20.540 align:middle line:84%
into vast expanse of spiritual
territory, everything which

00:05:20.540 --> 00:05:24.770 align:middle line:84%
keeps you focused in your
personal world has to be

00:05:24.770 --> 00:05:26.970 align:middle line:90%
surrendered, has to let go.

00:05:26.970 --> 00:05:30.140 align:middle line:84%
And so if you're going to swim
in the deep waters of the ocean

00:05:30.140 --> 00:05:34.200 align:middle line:84%
of consciousness, you have to
let go of your small territory.

00:05:34.200 --> 00:05:36.890 align:middle line:84%
And so you go through
a process of surrender,

00:05:36.890 --> 00:05:40.730 align:middle line:84%
either gently or convulsively,
where you basically

00:05:40.730 --> 00:05:44.450 align:middle line:84%
let your individual
identity die or you

00:05:44.450 --> 00:05:46.787 align:middle line:90%
are forced into letting go of--

00:05:46.787 --> 00:05:48.620 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: It sounds
like in your first one.

00:05:48.620 --> 00:05:50.082 align:middle line:90%
You were just deconstructed.

00:05:50.082 --> 00:05:51.290 align:middle line:90%
>> BACHE: [LAUGHS] Radically.

00:05:51.290 --> 00:05:52.010 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: --deconstructed.

00:05:52.010 --> 00:05:53.630 align:middle line:84%
>> BACHE: I mean,
the universe after--

00:05:53.630 --> 00:05:55.613 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Your first trip.

00:05:55.613 --> 00:05:57.530 align:middle line:84%
>> BACHE: Well, the first
trip was that, yeah,

00:05:57.530 --> 00:05:59.270 align:middle line:84%
I could not remember
anything about me.

00:05:59.270 --> 00:06:01.430 align:middle line:84%
I could not remember my
name, couldn't remember--

00:06:01.430 --> 00:06:04.490 align:middle line:84%
I couldn't remember what sex I
was, what I did for a living.

00:06:04.490 --> 00:06:06.440 align:middle line:84%
And that was the
universe saying to me,

00:06:06.440 --> 00:06:08.660 align:middle line:84%
you're not in control
of this adventure.

00:06:08.660 --> 00:06:11.690 align:middle line:84%
Let go, we're in control
of this adventure.

00:06:11.690 --> 00:06:13.940 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: Well, when you
finish that up, you thought,

00:06:13.940 --> 00:06:18.060 align:middle line:84%
what was I thinking even
starting this whole thing?

00:06:18.060 --> 00:06:20.250 align:middle line:84%
>> BACHE: And that could I
die without really dying?

00:06:20.250 --> 00:06:22.740 align:middle line:84%
Could I go through ego
death without really dying?

00:06:22.740 --> 00:06:25.020 align:middle line:84%
And it's a genuine
profound death.

00:06:25.020 --> 00:06:29.550 align:middle line:84%
It's a much more excruciating
death than physical death

00:06:29.550 --> 00:06:31.413 align:middle line:84%
because when you
die physically--

00:06:31.413 --> 00:06:32.580 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: You're still you.

00:06:32.580 --> 00:06:34.410 align:middle line:84%
>> BACHE: --your
consciousness continues.

00:06:34.410 --> 00:06:37.560 align:middle line:84%
But here, you are
physically alive

00:06:37.560 --> 00:06:41.130 align:middle line:84%
but your organizational
identity is destroyed.

00:06:41.130 --> 00:06:43.230 align:middle line:84%
And after two years
of work, the way

00:06:43.230 --> 00:06:45.630 align:middle line:84%
it destroyed mine is
it basically turned me

00:06:45.630 --> 00:06:48.090 align:middle line:84%
into the exact
opposite of everything

00:06:48.090 --> 00:06:49.530 align:middle line:90%
I had known myself to be.

00:06:49.530 --> 00:06:52.830 align:middle line:84%
So I'm a male, I'm
white, I'm a philosopher,

00:06:52.830 --> 00:06:55.620 align:middle line:84%
I'm passionately concerned
about the meaning of life.

00:06:55.620 --> 00:06:58.170 align:middle line:84%
It just negated all of
those things that turned me

00:06:58.170 --> 00:07:01.080 align:middle line:84%
into women, lots of
women, women of culture,

00:07:01.080 --> 00:07:03.450 align:middle line:84%
women who are not educated,
who are not concerned

00:07:03.450 --> 00:07:04.830 align:middle line:90%
about the meaning of life.

00:07:04.830 --> 00:07:07.330 align:middle line:84%
And the problem, of course,
wasn't women at all.

00:07:07.330 --> 00:07:12.360 align:middle line:84%
It was that my identity was
white male, philosopher,

00:07:12.360 --> 00:07:13.810 align:middle line:90%
and it just snapped it.

00:07:13.810 --> 00:07:16.470 align:middle line:84%
It did not give me-- it
gave me no opportunity

00:07:16.470 --> 00:07:19.890 align:middle line:84%
to experience life except from
within the lives of women.

00:07:19.890 --> 00:07:21.210 align:middle line:90%
First, I fought it.

00:07:21.210 --> 00:07:22.280 align:middle line:90%
I was scared.

00:07:22.280 --> 00:07:25.215 align:middle line:84%
When I let go, then the
most wonderful world--

00:07:25.215 --> 00:07:27.840 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: You were-- it sounds
like you were originally aghast

00:07:27.840 --> 00:07:29.160 align:middle line:90%
and kind of appalled.

00:07:29.160 --> 00:07:32.785 align:middle line:84%
You dropped into the way women
were chatting and functioning

00:07:32.785 --> 00:07:34.410 align:middle line:84%
with each other over
things that seemed

00:07:34.410 --> 00:07:37.770 align:middle line:84%
so supercilious to a
professor like yourself.

00:07:37.770 --> 00:07:38.640 align:middle line:90%
>> BACHE: I know.

00:07:38.640 --> 00:07:42.060 align:middle line:84%
Yeah, but the issue
is it just wasn't me.

00:07:42.060 --> 00:07:43.410 align:middle line:90%
This was not me.

00:07:43.410 --> 00:07:47.250 align:middle line:84%
And it was like the universe was
saying, where you were going,

00:07:47.250 --> 00:07:48.810 align:middle line:90%
gender does not exist.

00:07:48.810 --> 00:07:49.840 align:middle line:90%
Let go.

00:07:49.840 --> 00:07:52.170 align:middle line:84%
So I had to let go
of my male identity.

00:07:52.170 --> 00:07:55.840 align:middle line:84%
I had to let go of my
professional identity.

00:07:55.840 --> 00:07:57.820 align:middle line:84%
I had to let go of
all of those things.

00:07:57.820 --> 00:08:01.500 align:middle line:84%
And when I did, then I was
taken into the first level.

00:08:01.500 --> 00:08:03.630 align:middle line:84%
I was taken into
the world of women

00:08:03.630 --> 00:08:05.430 align:middle line:84%
under the arm of
the great mother.

00:08:05.430 --> 00:08:07.620 align:middle line:84%
And was shown,
allowed to experience

00:08:07.620 --> 00:08:12.330 align:middle line:84%
100,000 of women's lives
in a life-changing journey.

00:08:12.330 --> 00:08:17.070 align:middle line:84%
And this was just the
first of many journeys.

00:08:17.070 --> 00:08:20.100 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: So in terms of
coming back from those journeys,

00:08:20.100 --> 00:08:23.340 align:middle line:84%
that journey as being a
woman, as giving birth,

00:08:23.340 --> 00:08:26.790 align:middle line:84%
and part of femininity,
what was, say,

00:08:26.790 --> 00:08:31.290 align:middle line:84%
the biggest gift of that to you
in your waking time after you

00:08:31.290 --> 00:08:34.380 align:middle line:90%
came back from this journey?

00:08:34.380 --> 00:08:39.220 align:middle line:84%
>> BACHE: It sort of changed my
way of operating in the world.

00:08:39.220 --> 00:08:41.850 align:middle line:84%
I was very analytic,
trained as a philosopher,

00:08:41.850 --> 00:08:45.270 align:middle line:84%
early as a historian, I was
very kind of argumentative

00:08:45.270 --> 00:08:46.470 align:middle line:90%
in my strategy.

00:08:46.470 --> 00:08:48.870 align:middle line:84%
It was about really
an aggressive posture

00:08:48.870 --> 00:08:51.360 align:middle line:84%
to find out what was
true and analyze it.

00:08:51.360 --> 00:08:52.980 align:middle line:90%
And it softened all of that.

00:08:52.980 --> 00:08:56.460 align:middle line:84%
It basically put me in
touch with a gentler way,

00:08:56.460 --> 00:08:57.990 align:middle line:90%
more intuitive way.

00:08:57.990 --> 00:09:00.690 align:middle line:84%
I mean, I didn't lose
my analytic skills

00:09:00.690 --> 00:09:05.250 align:middle line:84%
but it gave me a gentler way
of working with those skills.

00:09:05.250 --> 00:09:08.880 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: And as you
went on, you started--

00:09:08.880 --> 00:09:11.880 align:middle line:84%
well, the word "excruciating"
comes up a lot in the book.

00:09:11.880 --> 00:09:14.400 align:middle line:84%
These were excruciating
sessions a lot of times

00:09:14.400 --> 00:09:16.380 align:middle line:84%
because not only
were you dissolving,

00:09:16.380 --> 00:09:18.180 align:middle line:84%
you were going through
a continual death.

00:09:18.180 --> 00:09:22.680 align:middle line:84%
It's almost like Groundhog
Day except I'm dying again.

00:09:22.680 --> 00:09:28.090 align:middle line:84%
You kept dying and dying, and it
felt like actual death to you.

00:09:28.090 --> 00:09:28.890 align:middle line:90%
>> BACHE: Yeah.

00:09:28.890 --> 00:09:30.150 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Actual death.

00:09:30.150 --> 00:09:32.907 align:middle line:84%
>> BACHE: Until death
eventually becomes your friend.

00:09:32.907 --> 00:09:34.990 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: And you start
looking forward to dying.

00:09:34.990 --> 00:09:36.820 align:middle line:84%
That I found a
fascinating turning point,

00:09:36.820 --> 00:09:38.670 align:middle line:84%
but that's a little
later in the story.

00:09:38.670 --> 00:09:40.420 align:middle line:84%
So before you start
looking forward to it,

00:09:40.420 --> 00:09:43.150 align:middle line:84%
you're going through these
multiple excruciating deaths,

00:09:43.150 --> 00:09:44.920 align:middle line:84%
but you went through
one in which you

00:09:44.920 --> 00:09:47.810 align:middle line:84%
witnessed the suffering
of many, many children.

00:09:47.810 --> 00:09:49.780 align:middle line:84%
So this is following
on from the experience

00:09:49.780 --> 00:09:52.480 align:middle line:84%
of being a woman to
the experience of being

00:09:52.480 --> 00:09:56.200 align:middle line:84%
the feminine losing
our children to all

00:09:56.200 --> 00:10:00.880 align:middle line:84%
these essentially
male agendas of war,

00:10:00.880 --> 00:10:03.520 align:middle line:90%
in particular, competition.

00:10:03.520 --> 00:10:06.460 align:middle line:84%
And tell us a little bit
about experiencing the deaths

00:10:06.460 --> 00:10:08.350 align:middle line:90%
of all these children.

00:10:08.350 --> 00:10:11.410 align:middle line:84%
>> BACHE: Let me say initially
that I've learned over

00:10:11.410 --> 00:10:15.070 align:middle line:84%
the course of many years
that I am truly a servant

00:10:15.070 --> 00:10:16.390 align:middle line:90%
of the mother.

00:10:16.390 --> 00:10:22.540 align:middle line:84%
I feel myself very much aligned
with the feminine quality.

00:10:22.540 --> 00:10:24.580 align:middle line:90%
I'm a man, I like being a man.

00:10:24.580 --> 00:10:27.130 align:middle line:90%
This is a deeper level.

00:10:27.130 --> 00:10:29.350 align:middle line:84%
I serve the work
of the great mother

00:10:29.350 --> 00:10:30.940 align:middle line:90%
in her work in the world.

00:10:30.940 --> 00:10:34.800 align:middle line:84%
And she is the mother of
all life, all life forms.

00:10:34.800 --> 00:10:37.590 align:middle line:84%
After I finished-- after I
went through the ego death

00:10:37.590 --> 00:10:40.050 align:middle line:84%
experience, I had a
particular experience

00:10:40.050 --> 00:10:43.380 align:middle line:84%
that I call the killing of the
children in which I experienced

00:10:43.380 --> 00:10:45.690 align:middle line:84%
thousands and
thousands of children

00:10:45.690 --> 00:10:49.710 align:middle line:84%
being killed by soldiers,
just being smashed, just

00:10:49.710 --> 00:10:51.210 align:middle line:90%
being destroyed.

00:10:51.210 --> 00:10:54.660 align:middle line:84%
And I became an oriental
woman trying to stop them,

00:10:54.660 --> 00:10:57.840 align:middle line:84%
beating on their chest
trying to stop the killing.

00:10:57.840 --> 00:11:00.930 align:middle line:84%
And they just brushed me aside
and kept about their work.

00:11:00.930 --> 00:11:03.210 align:middle line:90%
It was excruciatingly painful.

00:11:03.210 --> 00:11:06.240 align:middle line:84%
And this was a transition
I learned later

00:11:06.240 --> 00:11:09.300 align:middle line:84%
to the next phase of my work,
which was entering into what

00:11:09.300 --> 00:11:11.700 align:middle line:84%
I call the ocean
of suffering, which

00:11:11.700 --> 00:11:16.560 align:middle line:84%
is a vast territory, a
collective territory, a residue

00:11:16.560 --> 00:11:19.950 align:middle line:84%
of human history, of human
suffering accumulated

00:11:19.950 --> 00:11:21.000 align:middle line:90%
through history.

00:11:21.000 --> 00:11:23.130 align:middle line:84%
All the wars, all
the terrible things

00:11:23.130 --> 00:11:25.230 align:middle line:84%
we've done to each
other, all the droughts,

00:11:25.230 --> 00:11:29.010 align:middle line:84%
that all these trauma live
within the collective psyche

00:11:29.010 --> 00:11:33.630 align:middle line:84%
just as individual trauma live
within the individual psyche.

00:11:33.630 --> 00:11:36.430 align:middle line:84%
The killing of the
children was an experience

00:11:36.430 --> 00:11:39.130 align:middle line:84%
that was designed to awaken
what the Buddhists would

00:11:39.130 --> 00:11:44.620 align:middle line:84%
call "bodhichitta," the desire
to save sentient beings.

00:11:44.620 --> 00:11:47.860 align:middle line:84%
For me, it was
awakening a soul desire

00:11:47.860 --> 00:11:53.320 align:middle line:84%
that I had taken on to work
to help ease and end the anger

00:11:53.320 --> 00:11:55.220 align:middle line:90%
and suffering in existence.

00:11:55.220 --> 00:11:58.630 align:middle line:84%
So that I very
self-consciously put myself

00:11:58.630 --> 00:12:03.430 align:middle line:84%
in between all this
raging, killing, terror,

00:12:03.430 --> 00:12:06.100 align:middle line:84%
and the children of
unborn generations,

00:12:06.100 --> 00:12:08.920 align:middle line:84%
and engaged it in
a way that I was

00:12:08.920 --> 00:12:13.400 align:middle line:84%
conscious of trying to
absorb it and impact it

00:12:13.400 --> 00:12:17.080 align:middle line:84%
so that it would not be able
to reach future generations.

00:12:17.080 --> 00:12:19.430 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: And that is where
we're headed as a species.

00:12:19.430 --> 00:12:22.435 align:middle line:84%
We are going to see
the end of war in time.

00:12:22.435 --> 00:12:23.650 align:middle line:90%
>> BACHE: We have to.

00:12:23.650 --> 00:12:24.450 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: We will.

00:12:24.450 --> 00:12:25.675 align:middle line:90%
We will in time.

00:12:25.675 --> 00:12:27.550 align:middle line:84%
And we're having things
forced in front of us

00:12:27.550 --> 00:12:29.830 align:middle line:84%
the last few months
to watch the killing,

00:12:29.830 --> 00:12:32.230 align:middle line:90%
massive levels of killing of--

00:12:32.230 --> 00:12:34.600 align:middle line:84%
killing of children
were the world

00:12:34.600 --> 00:12:36.070 align:middle line:84%
is just sitting
numb and appalled

00:12:36.070 --> 00:12:38.170 align:middle line:84%
and not knowing what
to do with what's

00:12:38.170 --> 00:12:40.930 align:middle line:84%
happened, with the loss of
so many children's lives

00:12:40.930 --> 00:12:43.840 align:middle line:84%
and every mother, every
person can feel now.

00:12:43.840 --> 00:12:44.960 align:middle line:90%
This doesn't work anymore.

00:12:44.960 --> 00:12:45.760 align:middle line:90%
>> BACHE: Yeah.

00:12:45.760 --> 00:12:48.910 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: It never did, but
now we're aware enough through

00:12:48.910 --> 00:12:53.140 align:middle line:84%
being able to tap into media
sources and news sources.

00:12:53.140 --> 00:12:56.380 align:middle line:84%
We have exposure to it, which
we didn't have in ancient times.

00:12:56.380 --> 00:12:58.987 align:middle line:84%
So now we all see this
ocean of suffering.

00:12:58.987 --> 00:13:00.070 align:middle line:90%
>> BACHE: We all watch it.

00:13:00.070 --> 00:13:00.490 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:13:00.490 --> 00:13:01.250 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: We're seeing it.

00:13:01.250 --> 00:13:03.392 align:middle line:84%
So then you pass through
the ocean of suffering,

00:13:03.392 --> 00:13:04.600 align:middle line:90%
which is beyond the children.

00:13:04.600 --> 00:13:06.550 align:middle line:84%
It's almost like
the disembowelment

00:13:06.550 --> 00:13:07.810 align:middle line:90%
of the entire species.

00:13:07.810 --> 00:13:10.930 align:middle line:84%
They really-- these are
many sessions in now--

00:13:10.930 --> 00:13:13.540 align:middle line:84%
they really took you
deeper and deeper

00:13:13.540 --> 00:13:16.990 align:middle line:84%
into the nature of
what we collectively

00:13:16.990 --> 00:13:19.760 align:middle line:90%
hold in our greater mind.

00:13:19.760 --> 00:13:20.560 align:middle line:90%
>> BACHE: Yeah.

00:13:20.560 --> 00:13:22.250 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: All of the suffering.

00:13:22.250 --> 00:13:24.983 align:middle line:84%
And when you finally hit the
ocean of suffering, I mean,

00:13:24.983 --> 00:13:26.650 align:middle line:84%
most people would
say, I think I'm going

00:13:26.650 --> 00:13:28.640 align:middle line:90%
to call it quits at this point.

00:13:28.640 --> 00:13:31.270 align:middle line:84%
So tell us about that and
what happened for you?

00:13:31.270 --> 00:13:33.700 align:middle line:84%
>> BACHE: Well, you have
to understand in this type

00:13:33.700 --> 00:13:37.530 align:middle line:84%
of work, as I experience working
in psychedelics the way that I

00:13:37.530 --> 00:13:41.580 align:middle line:84%
did, the first half of every
session is spent in some type

00:13:41.580 --> 00:13:44.370 align:middle line:84%
of purifying or
death experience.

00:13:44.370 --> 00:13:48.180 align:middle line:84%
And that reaches a
culmination where

00:13:48.180 --> 00:13:50.160 align:middle line:84%
there is a sacrifice,
something you're

00:13:50.160 --> 00:13:53.200 align:middle line:84%
asked to give up, something
you're asked to do, you do it.

00:13:53.200 --> 00:13:54.960 align:middle line:84%
And when that
happens, you're spun

00:13:54.960 --> 00:13:58.890 align:middle line:84%
for the remainder of the session
in ecstatic blissful states

00:13:58.890 --> 00:14:01.500 align:middle line:90%
of learning.

00:14:01.500 --> 00:14:05.070 align:middle line:84%
So there was repeated
excruciating experiences.

00:14:05.070 --> 00:14:08.610 align:middle line:84%
But at the end of the second
half of every session,

00:14:08.610 --> 00:14:10.830 align:middle line:84%
there was great joy,
there was great learning

00:14:10.830 --> 00:14:12.070 align:middle line:90%
that was given to me.

00:14:12.070 --> 00:14:12.930 align:middle line:90%
So I did this.

00:14:12.930 --> 00:14:14.880 align:middle line:84%
I stayed with the
work not because I

00:14:14.880 --> 00:14:17.220 align:middle line:84%
was a glutton for
the pain, because I

00:14:17.220 --> 00:14:20.370 align:middle line:84%
was a glutton for the
ecstasy and the bliss

00:14:20.370 --> 00:14:23.080 align:middle line:84%
and the teaching that was on
the other side of the pain.

00:14:23.080 --> 00:14:25.050 align:middle line:90%
So it was always balanced.

00:14:25.050 --> 00:14:27.570 align:middle line:84%
This is all part of a
cycle that you learn,

00:14:27.570 --> 00:14:33.130 align:middle line:84%
a cycle of purification followed
by illumination, initiation.

00:14:33.130 --> 00:14:35.500 align:middle line:90%
So death followed by rebirth.

00:14:35.500 --> 00:14:39.500 align:middle line:84%
And that's a repeating pattern
in the cycles as it is in life.

00:14:39.500 --> 00:14:42.930 align:middle line:84%
So I went into the
ocean of suffering.

00:14:42.930 --> 00:14:46.110 align:middle line:84%
I stayed in it for two
years, but I was also

00:14:46.110 --> 00:14:48.960 align:middle line:84%
given many blessings
during those two years.

00:14:48.960 --> 00:14:52.780 align:middle line:84%
Deep initiations
into the universe,

00:14:52.780 --> 00:14:56.880 align:middle line:84%
how the universe is structured,
mystical experiences

00:14:56.880 --> 00:15:01.920 align:middle line:84%
of returning into deep
experiences of oneness that

00:15:01.920 --> 00:15:05.460 align:middle line:84%
underlie our physical
diversity, going back

00:15:05.460 --> 00:15:08.190 align:middle line:84%
to the beginning of
time and experiencing

00:15:08.190 --> 00:15:10.980 align:middle line:84%
the birth of the universe
from a cosmic perspective.

00:15:10.980 --> 00:15:14.790 align:middle line:84%
These are deeply
touching experiences.

00:15:14.790 --> 00:15:19.230 align:middle line:84%
And the killing of the children
and the ocean of suffering

00:15:19.230 --> 00:15:23.683 align:middle line:84%
are simply something you do
because it needs to be done.

00:15:23.683 --> 00:15:26.100 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: Well, you needed
to understand the depth of it,

00:15:26.100 --> 00:15:29.310 align:middle line:84%
the complexity depth,
multidimensionality of it.

00:15:29.310 --> 00:15:31.740 align:middle line:84%
And I mean, but on the
other hand, as a human,

00:15:31.740 --> 00:15:33.540 align:middle line:84%
you'd come back
and your wife would

00:15:33.540 --> 00:15:39.270 align:middle line:84%
see this pale, damp, limp
human being that took weeks

00:15:39.270 --> 00:15:40.960 align:middle line:90%
to recover from these sessions.

00:15:40.960 --> 00:15:42.940 align:middle line:84%
It took so much out
of you physically.

00:15:42.940 --> 00:15:45.310 align:middle line:84%
So you did get the
blessings and the knowledge,

00:15:45.310 --> 00:15:47.930 align:middle line:84%
but still it took a
lot out of your body.

00:15:47.930 --> 00:15:50.980 align:middle line:84%
And at one point, she said,
why do you keep doing this?

00:15:50.980 --> 00:15:52.660 align:middle line:84%
Are you a glutton
for punishment?

00:15:52.660 --> 00:15:55.010 align:middle line:84%
And you felt you
could not back down.

00:15:55.010 --> 00:15:58.420 align:middle line:84%
You had to go through
this to take one

00:15:58.420 --> 00:16:01.990 align:middle line:84%
for humanity for the
direction of our future.

00:16:01.990 --> 00:16:04.810 align:middle line:84%
>> BACHE: Well, I don't know
that I would be that heroic

00:16:04.810 --> 00:16:06.100 align:middle line:90%
in my self-description.

00:16:06.100 --> 00:16:08.050 align:middle line:90%
To me, this was an exploration.

00:16:08.050 --> 00:16:09.400 align:middle line:90%
This was an adventure.

00:16:09.400 --> 00:16:12.070 align:middle line:84%
People use psychedelics
for many different reasons.

00:16:12.070 --> 00:16:14.830 align:middle line:84%
Today, very strongly,
the most common one

00:16:14.830 --> 00:16:17.510 align:middle line:84%
is therapeutic healing,
very important.

00:16:17.510 --> 00:16:19.570 align:middle line:84%
Another one is
spiritual awakening.

00:16:19.570 --> 00:16:24.670 align:middle line:84%
For me, my work was an adventure
in cosmological exploration.

00:16:24.670 --> 00:16:27.850 align:middle line:84%
I wanted to know how the
universe is structured,

00:16:27.850 --> 00:16:31.540 align:middle line:84%
why is there so much suffering,
where are we going, what's

00:16:31.540 --> 00:16:34.490 align:middle line:84%
the fundamental-- what's the
underlying structure of reality

00:16:34.490 --> 00:16:35.290 align:middle line:90%
itself.

00:16:35.290 --> 00:16:37.960 align:middle line:84%
This was an opportunity
to explore these things

00:16:37.960 --> 00:16:39.720 align:middle line:90%
experientially.

00:16:39.720 --> 00:16:42.910 align:middle line:84%
No price is too great
to pay for this type.

00:16:42.910 --> 00:16:45.660 align:middle line:84%
So there was
tremendous intellectual

00:16:45.660 --> 00:16:48.180 align:middle line:84%
and spiritual nourishment
along the way.

00:16:48.180 --> 00:16:49.170 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Understood.

00:16:49.170 --> 00:16:52.530 align:middle line:84%
Nonetheless, you finally
said, OK, I'll stop.

00:16:52.530 --> 00:16:53.800 align:middle line:90%
And you stop for six years.

00:16:53.800 --> 00:16:54.600 align:middle line:90%
>> BACHE: I did.

00:16:54.600 --> 00:16:56.430 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: At her request,
you stopped for six years.

00:16:56.430 --> 00:16:58.290 align:middle line:84%
I think she was having
a hard time handling

00:16:58.290 --> 00:16:59.710 align:middle line:90%
your physical suffering.

00:16:59.710 --> 00:17:00.510 align:middle line:90%
But--

00:17:00.510 --> 00:17:02.582 align:middle line:84%
>> BACHE: She asked me
to stop and I stopped.

00:17:02.582 --> 00:17:04.290 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: And you
stopped for six years.

00:17:04.290 --> 00:17:04.589 align:middle line:90%
>> BACHE: Yeah.

00:17:04.589 --> 00:17:06.510 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: And then
when you went back,

00:17:06.510 --> 00:17:11.230 align:middle line:84%
the shocking part of that
story, you didn't miss a beat.

00:17:11.230 --> 00:17:14.670 align:middle line:84%
They picked up exactly
where you left off,

00:17:14.670 --> 00:17:17.130 align:middle line:84%
whoever was guiding this
remembered where you left

00:17:17.130 --> 00:17:18.869 align:middle line:90%
off and picked it up again.

00:17:18.869 --> 00:17:21.480 align:middle line:84%
And then you start moving
into the cosmic tree

00:17:21.480 --> 00:17:24.960 align:middle line:84%
of life, the fundamental
nature of reality.

00:17:24.960 --> 00:17:28.470 align:middle line:84%
The basis of the building
blocks of reality,

00:17:28.470 --> 00:17:32.700 align:middle line:84%
which in hermetics they refer
to as kind of logos and prima

00:17:32.700 --> 00:17:36.090 align:middle line:84%
materia, just that
field, the chaotic field

00:17:36.090 --> 00:17:38.190 align:middle line:84%
that you can imprint
with word or thought

00:17:38.190 --> 00:17:39.890 align:middle line:90%
to begin the creation process.

00:17:39.890 --> 00:17:41.380 align:middle line:90%
And that's where you went.

00:17:41.380 --> 00:17:44.020 align:middle line:84%
Can you talk a little bit
about the fabric of our reality

00:17:44.020 --> 00:17:45.220 align:middle line:90%
underneath everything?

00:17:45.220 --> 00:17:47.780 align:middle line:90%


00:17:47.780 --> 00:17:51.080 align:middle line:84%
>> BACHE: So beautiful, so
extraordinary beautiful.

00:17:51.080 --> 00:17:53.750 align:middle line:10%
When you let go of
your personal existence

00:17:53.750 --> 00:17:56.960 align:middle line:10%
and when you let go of even
your historical existence

00:17:56.960 --> 00:18:01.400 align:middle line:10%
or the existence of yourself as
a member of the human species

00:18:01.400 --> 00:18:05.630 align:middle line:10%
and fall deeply into
the nature of reality

00:18:05.630 --> 00:18:08.210 align:middle line:10%
itself or the reality
behind the reality,

00:18:08.210 --> 00:18:11.760 align:middle line:10%
like the Plato's prisoner
escaping from the cave

00:18:11.760 --> 00:18:16.070 align:middle line:10%
and entering the domain which
you just experienced as more

00:18:16.070 --> 00:18:19.850 align:middle line:10%
real than time and space, and
more ancient, just ancient

00:18:19.850 --> 00:18:22.940 align:middle line:10%
beyond measure and more real.

00:18:22.940 --> 00:18:26.360 align:middle line:84%
And then being given, taken
on journeys where you're

00:18:26.360 --> 00:18:30.350 align:middle line:84%
shown how this works and
shown how reincarnation works

00:18:30.350 --> 00:18:33.920 align:middle line:84%
and shown the fundamental
oneness that's

00:18:33.920 --> 00:18:37.760 align:middle line:84%
living and breathing and pulsing
inside the diversity of life

00:18:37.760 --> 00:18:43.060 align:middle line:84%
as the diversity of life for
a higher purpose within life,

00:18:43.060 --> 00:18:47.680 align:middle line:84%
bringing a fruition within
life, these are great blessings.

00:18:47.680 --> 00:18:48.878 align:middle line:90%
Hard to summarize.

00:18:48.878 --> 00:18:50.920 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: Well, it'd be
hard to even articulate.

00:18:50.920 --> 00:18:52.250 align:middle line:90%
>> BACHE: Yeah.

00:18:52.250 --> 00:18:53.050 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:18:53.050 --> 00:18:55.130 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: But I think
you just did a great job.

00:18:55.130 --> 00:18:58.810 align:middle line:84%
So from there, you went on to
of dying into oneness which was

00:18:58.810 --> 00:19:01.075 align:middle line:90%
another quite painful incident.

00:19:01.075 --> 00:19:02.950 align:middle line:84%
But I want to break
through that because this

00:19:02.950 --> 00:19:04.670 align:middle line:90%
starts moving into karma.

00:19:04.670 --> 00:19:08.760 align:middle line:84%
And then you had, like
you said a moment ago,

00:19:08.760 --> 00:19:12.570 align:middle line:84%
and I'm having my notes, you
had reached an ancient reality

00:19:12.570 --> 00:19:14.460 align:middle line:84%
that was more real
than everything

00:19:14.460 --> 00:19:17.100 align:middle line:84%
you understood about your
own reality right now.

00:19:17.100 --> 00:19:19.740 align:middle line:84%
And that took you out into
the cosmos ultimately.

00:19:19.740 --> 00:19:22.872 align:middle line:84%
Session 26, which I found
absolutely fascinating,

00:19:22.872 --> 00:19:24.330 align:middle line:84%
and you're still
struggling to find

00:19:24.330 --> 00:19:27.580 align:middle line:90%
the exact right terminology.

00:19:27.580 --> 00:19:32.690 align:middle line:84%
You met with beings
that were so vast.

00:19:32.690 --> 00:19:35.400 align:middle line:84%
And this is how you wrote
about it in the book.

00:19:35.400 --> 00:19:38.020 align:middle line:84%
But you say it's
still not adequate.

00:19:38.020 --> 00:19:41.980 align:middle line:84%
You saw that these beings
create through humanity,

00:19:41.980 --> 00:19:46.700 align:middle line:84%
live through humanity, satisfy
themselves through humanity.

00:19:46.700 --> 00:19:51.292 align:middle line:84%
And so of course, we wonder,
who, what are these beings?

00:19:51.292 --> 00:19:52.750 align:middle line:84%
What is the nature
of these beings?

00:19:52.750 --> 00:19:55.270 align:middle line:84%
How did it feel being
in their presence?

00:19:55.270 --> 00:19:57.970 align:middle line:84%
Was it a thing that felt
frightening in you serious?

00:19:57.970 --> 00:20:01.630 align:middle line:84%
Or was it just something
that's companionable and that

00:20:01.630 --> 00:20:03.670 align:middle line:90%
were maybe only an extension of?

00:20:03.670 --> 00:20:05.730 align:middle line:90%
>> BACHE: Yeah.

00:20:05.730 --> 00:20:09.900 align:middle line:84%
This is a challenging portion
of the journey to describe.

00:20:09.900 --> 00:20:12.870 align:middle line:84%
When the ocean of suffering
came to a culmination,

00:20:12.870 --> 00:20:17.280 align:middle line:84%
there was an orgy of suffering
that then the process completed

00:20:17.280 --> 00:20:21.060 align:middle line:84%
itself and I was spun into
a higher level of reality

00:20:21.060 --> 00:20:23.550 align:middle line:84%
and I entered what
I came to understand

00:20:23.550 --> 00:20:25.410 align:middle line:90%
as archetypal reality.

00:20:25.410 --> 00:20:28.080 align:middle line:84%
And my first encounter
with archetypal reality

00:20:28.080 --> 00:20:32.070 align:middle line:84%
versus tremendous
energy is like going

00:20:32.070 --> 00:20:35.910 align:middle line:84%
through volcanoes, burning
suns to escalate the energy.

00:20:35.910 --> 00:20:38.460 align:middle line:84%
Every deeper level
of reality functions

00:20:38.460 --> 00:20:39.990 align:middle line:90%
at a higher level of energy.

00:20:39.990 --> 00:20:42.180 align:middle line:84%
And to enter into
archetypal reality,

00:20:42.180 --> 00:20:46.410 align:middle line:84%
you have to make a huge
transition in just energy

00:20:46.410 --> 00:20:50.130 align:middle line:84%
to attune, to survive
the energy of that level.

00:20:50.130 --> 00:20:53.620 align:middle line:84%
When I went into that
reality, I encountered--

00:20:53.620 --> 00:20:57.540 align:middle line:84%
and I don't know whether to
call them beings or principles,

00:20:57.540 --> 00:21:00.520 align:middle line:84%
they're not beings in any
way that we can usually

00:21:00.520 --> 00:21:01.320 align:middle line:90%
imagine them.

00:21:01.320 --> 00:21:05.530 align:middle line:84%
They were so large and
so vast, the only way

00:21:05.530 --> 00:21:08.260 align:middle line:84%
my mind could envision
them, could see them,

00:21:08.260 --> 00:21:10.570 align:middle line:84%
the best approximation
it could give

00:21:10.570 --> 00:21:15.070 align:middle line:84%
was to see them as galaxies,
hundreds of billions

00:21:15.070 --> 00:21:17.050 align:middle line:90%
of light years across.

00:21:17.050 --> 00:21:19.930 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: Very, very conscious
with their own directive

00:21:19.930 --> 00:21:21.670 align:middle line:90%
and experience.

00:21:21.670 --> 00:21:24.730 align:middle line:84%
>> BACHE: I didn't even get that
much of a penetration to them.

00:21:24.730 --> 00:21:28.150 align:middle line:84%
What I saw was these
massive principles,

00:21:28.150 --> 00:21:33.430 align:middle line:84%
massive beings completely beyond
my mind's ability to grasp.

00:21:33.430 --> 00:21:36.430 align:middle line:84%
And they were the
beings responsible

00:21:36.430 --> 00:21:39.550 align:middle line:84%
for creating space and
time, and for creating

00:21:39.550 --> 00:21:41.200 align:middle line:84%
some of these
fundamental structures

00:21:41.200 --> 00:21:42.650 align:middle line:90%
within space and time.

00:21:42.650 --> 00:21:44.800 align:middle line:84%
So the basic
cosmology that emerges

00:21:44.800 --> 00:21:48.830 align:middle line:84%
is everything emerges
out of a primal one.

00:21:48.830 --> 00:21:52.800 align:middle line:84%
The one manifests a series of
cascading levels of reality.

00:21:52.800 --> 00:21:55.010 align:middle line:84%
It's a pretty
classical and standard

00:21:55.010 --> 00:21:57.620 align:middle line:90%
sort of spiritual cosmology.

00:21:57.620 --> 00:21:59.500 align:middle line:84%
There are many
intermediate levels

00:21:59.500 --> 00:22:02.890 align:middle line:84%
between the one and
physical existence.

00:22:02.890 --> 00:22:06.850 align:middle line:84%
One of those levels are some
of those levels are archetypal.

00:22:06.850 --> 00:22:09.160 align:middle line:84%
They are the
constitutive principles,

00:22:09.160 --> 00:22:12.610 align:middle line:84%
these constitutive
spiritual beings

00:22:12.610 --> 00:22:16.090 align:middle line:84%
or principles which are
responsible for manifesting

00:22:16.090 --> 00:22:20.420 align:middle line:84%
layers of reality beneath
them into time and space.

00:22:20.420 --> 00:22:24.250 align:middle line:84%
And so there's a sense in which
we participate in their being.

00:22:24.250 --> 00:22:26.170 align:middle line:90%
We are part of their being.

00:22:26.170 --> 00:22:30.310 align:middle line:84%
Not in any small sense, but
in a massive cosmic sense.

00:22:30.310 --> 00:22:33.910 align:middle line:84%
And I did not experience any
infringement on my freedom.

00:22:33.910 --> 00:22:37.210 align:middle line:84%
I did not experience any
manipulative intent or anything

00:22:37.210 --> 00:22:39.430 align:middle line:84%
like that that would
compromise our life.

00:22:39.430 --> 00:22:41.470 align:middle line:84%
I think I simply
was experiencing

00:22:41.470 --> 00:22:44.740 align:middle line:84%
what has always been the
case, and what's always

00:22:44.740 --> 00:22:48.340 align:middle line:84%
been the case is that our
physical lives are embedded

00:22:48.340 --> 00:22:50.800 align:middle line:84%
in a spiritual
cosmology that has

00:22:50.800 --> 00:22:54.240 align:middle line:84%
many levels and many
gradients of being.

00:22:54.240 --> 00:22:57.180 align:middle line:84%
And once you begin
to be aware of it,

00:22:57.180 --> 00:23:01.540 align:middle line:84%
then you begin to think,
oh OK, that's how it works.

00:23:01.540 --> 00:23:02.980 align:middle line:90%
That's how it's going on.

00:23:02.980 --> 00:23:05.040 align:middle line:84%
And that's a
relaxation into that.

00:23:05.040 --> 00:23:06.360 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: That's so beautiful.

00:23:06.360 --> 00:23:09.180 align:middle line:84%
So looking at what
you just said,

00:23:09.180 --> 00:23:13.200 align:middle line:84%
the architects of time and
space and other constituents

00:23:13.200 --> 00:23:16.270 align:middle line:84%
or the building blocks of
reality of life itself.

00:23:16.270 --> 00:23:19.110 align:middle line:84%
So could we say
that they perhaps

00:23:19.110 --> 00:23:24.180 align:middle line:84%
were the progenitors of things
like geometry, color, light,

00:23:24.180 --> 00:23:27.030 align:middle line:84%
sound, and all of
that along with it?

00:23:27.030 --> 00:23:28.710 align:middle line:90%
>> BACHE: Could be.

00:23:28.710 --> 00:23:31.170 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: As building blocks
that create this reality that

00:23:31.170 --> 00:23:36.660 align:middle line:84%
our mind interfaces with and
somehow assembles and trying

00:23:36.660 --> 00:23:40.330 align:middle line:84%
to imagine the assemblage
at that level was

00:23:40.330 --> 00:23:41.130 align:middle line:90%
incomprehensible.

00:23:41.130 --> 00:23:44.760 align:middle line:84%
>> BACHE: Very similar to
Plato's archetypes ideas

00:23:44.760 --> 00:23:48.120 align:middle line:84%
in the mind of an eternal God
except they were not ideas

00:23:48.120 --> 00:23:49.950 align:middle line:84%
in the mind of an
unchanging God.

00:23:49.950 --> 00:23:52.410 align:middle line:84%
They were not unchanging
eternal ideas.

00:23:52.410 --> 00:23:55.900 align:middle line:84%
They were vast living
dynamic principles

00:23:55.900 --> 00:23:58.328 align:middle line:84%
that were moving
inside time, inside--

00:23:58.328 --> 00:24:00.370 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: And moving
through us, it sounds like.

00:24:00.370 --> 00:24:01.060 align:middle line:90%
>> BACHE: Moving through us.

00:24:01.060 --> 00:24:03.700 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: It says, creating
through us, living through us,

00:24:03.700 --> 00:24:06.370 align:middle line:84%
loving through us,
experiencing through us.

00:24:06.370 --> 00:24:10.210 align:middle line:84%
>> BACHE: Yes, on a completely
different order of time,

00:24:10.210 --> 00:24:12.920 align:middle line:84%
completely different
order of magnitude.

00:24:12.920 --> 00:24:15.820 align:middle line:84%
It's just a different
order of scale.

00:24:15.820 --> 00:24:18.070 align:middle line:84%
And that's why it
feels much more real.

00:24:18.070 --> 00:24:20.510 align:middle line:84%
It is more real
than time and space.

00:24:20.510 --> 00:24:23.695 align:middle line:84%
It is ancient compared to the
short time-- time and space

00:24:23.695 --> 00:24:25.990 align:middle line:90%
that has been in existence.

00:24:25.990 --> 00:24:30.100 align:middle line:84%
So you have to acclimate to
live in that reality for hours

00:24:30.100 --> 00:24:32.530 align:middle line:84%
at a time and to go back
into it and go back into it.

00:24:32.530 --> 00:24:34.480 align:middle line:90%
You have to acclimate to it.

00:24:34.480 --> 00:24:37.420 align:middle line:84%
And then after some
time in that reality,

00:24:37.420 --> 00:24:39.580 align:middle line:84%
I went through another
death and rebirth

00:24:39.580 --> 00:24:44.830 align:middle line:84%
sequence that catapulted me
into yet a still deeper level

00:24:44.830 --> 00:24:45.950 align:middle line:90%
of reality.

00:24:45.950 --> 00:24:47.210 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Share that with us.

00:24:47.210 --> 00:24:48.220 align:middle line:84%
>> BACHE: Well,
that took me in--

00:24:48.220 --> 00:24:50.350 align:middle line:84%
I describe it in the
book in a chapter called

00:24:50.350 --> 00:24:52.030 align:middle line:90%
"A Benediction of Blessings."

00:24:52.030 --> 00:24:55.270 align:middle line:84%
It was a year of just
incredible blessings

00:24:55.270 --> 00:24:59.020 align:middle line:84%
and I describe four
particular sessions there,

00:24:59.020 --> 00:25:01.090 align:middle line:84%
an experience of
what the Buddhists

00:25:01.090 --> 00:25:05.080 align:middle line:84%
call shunyata, emptiness
of self, no self to be.

00:25:05.080 --> 00:25:08.830 align:middle line:84%
In a reality where
there is no self here,

00:25:08.830 --> 00:25:11.750 align:middle line:84%
there's no self there, there's
no self anywhere in the world.

00:25:11.750 --> 00:25:15.310 align:middle line:84%
The world is living and
pulsing as a singular being.

00:25:15.310 --> 00:25:16.510 align:middle line:90%
It's a single being.

00:25:16.510 --> 00:25:19.900 align:middle line:84%
And when you experience that
profound level of oneness,

00:25:19.900 --> 00:25:21.940 align:middle line:84%
then it's just
immediately obvious there

00:25:21.940 --> 00:25:28.030 align:middle line:84%
is no separate being, myself is
not separate from this oneness.

00:25:28.030 --> 00:25:31.090 align:middle line:84%
Myself and this oneness
interpenetrate profoundly.

00:25:31.090 --> 00:25:33.550 align:middle line:84%
And the world lives
and moves as one.

00:25:33.550 --> 00:25:36.490 align:middle line:84%
And the image that came through
for that particular session

00:25:36.490 --> 00:25:37.750 align:middle line:90%
was the forest.

00:25:37.750 --> 00:25:40.780 align:middle line:84%
The forest is filled with many,
many different types of tree

00:25:40.780 --> 00:25:43.360 align:middle line:84%
but there's a single life
force that moves through them

00:25:43.360 --> 00:25:45.460 align:middle line:84%
all, doesn't care
whether it pines

00:25:45.460 --> 00:25:47.900 align:middle line:84%
or oaks or sycamores
or anything.

00:25:47.900 --> 00:25:49.810 align:middle line:90%
It's just a single life force.

00:25:49.810 --> 00:25:53.770 align:middle line:84%
An experience of cosmic
love, just an extraordinary

00:25:53.770 --> 00:25:58.810 align:middle line:84%
overwhelmed sensation of
being loved by the universe.

00:25:58.810 --> 00:26:01.600 align:middle line:84%
An experience of
the primal void,

00:26:01.600 --> 00:26:04.780 align:middle line:84%
just having an experience
where deep enmeshed

00:26:04.780 --> 00:26:09.070 align:middle line:84%
in the universe and the
universe just began to be erased

00:26:09.070 --> 00:26:11.170 align:middle line:84%
and entering into
the primal void

00:26:11.170 --> 00:26:14.110 align:middle line:84%
before the manifestation
of physical existence.

00:26:14.110 --> 00:26:17.050 align:middle line:84%
And then one particular
session in what I experienced

00:26:17.050 --> 00:26:19.000 align:middle line:84%
is the birth of
the diamond soul,

00:26:19.000 --> 00:26:21.880 align:middle line:84%
which is teaching me
where reincarnation

00:26:21.880 --> 00:26:23.110 align:middle line:90%
is taking humanity.

00:26:23.110 --> 00:26:25.110 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: And that's
where I wanted to go next.

00:26:25.110 --> 00:26:28.520 align:middle line:84%
So you say there is no such
thing as being apart from this.

00:26:28.520 --> 00:26:29.480 align:middle line:90%
We're all a part of it.

00:26:29.480 --> 00:26:31.430 align:middle line:84%
But let me just go
ahead in the framework

00:26:31.430 --> 00:26:33.110 align:middle line:90%
before we go into reincarnation.

00:26:33.110 --> 00:26:36.360 align:middle line:84%
Set that up as individuated
consciousness, soul

00:26:36.360 --> 00:26:37.160 align:middle line:90%
consciousness.

00:26:37.160 --> 00:26:39.440 align:middle line:84%
This is how you
define it in the book.

00:26:39.440 --> 00:26:41.270 align:middle line:84%
"A story of individual
consciousness

00:26:41.270 --> 00:26:43.820 align:middle line:84%
ultimately sourced in
the creative intelligence

00:26:43.820 --> 00:26:47.870 align:middle line:84%
of the cosmos, systematically
moving back and forth

00:26:47.870 --> 00:26:52.370 align:middle line:84%
between the physical universe
and a surround metaverse

00:26:52.370 --> 00:26:55.160 align:middle line:84%
in a long journey of
self-development."

00:26:55.160 --> 00:26:58.130 align:middle line:84%
I think that's one of the
best descriptions of soul

00:26:58.130 --> 00:26:59.420 align:middle line:90%
that I have ever seen.

00:26:59.420 --> 00:27:04.940 align:middle line:84%
And the beings that I am part
of call us a soul development.

00:27:04.940 --> 00:27:08.150 align:middle line:84%
They literally call
humanity a soul development

00:27:08.150 --> 00:27:11.480 align:middle line:84%
because it's constantly in the
process of still developing

00:27:11.480 --> 00:27:14.150 align:middle line:84%
as the unique hybrid
species we are.

00:27:14.150 --> 00:27:15.410 align:middle line:90%
So let's say that.

00:27:15.410 --> 00:27:17.210 align:middle line:90%
Now, we go to reincarnation.

00:27:17.210 --> 00:27:20.630 align:middle line:84%
We're individuated in this
vast sea of consciousness.

00:27:20.630 --> 00:27:24.170 align:middle line:84%
And let's talk about the
notion of reincarnation

00:27:24.170 --> 00:27:26.750 align:middle line:84%
from where you understood
it, and the notion

00:27:26.750 --> 00:27:29.600 align:middle line:84%
of purification
through reincarnation,

00:27:29.600 --> 00:27:34.460 align:middle line:84%
and of collective tribal
historical periods of time

00:27:34.460 --> 00:27:36.020 align:middle line:90%
reincarnating together.

00:27:36.020 --> 00:27:37.130 align:middle line:90%
>> BACHE: Yeah.

00:27:37.130 --> 00:27:40.340 align:middle line:84%
Well, I had written my first
book, it was on reincarnation,

00:27:40.340 --> 00:27:42.860 align:middle line:84%
and it's kind of a classical
book on reincarnation.

00:27:42.860 --> 00:27:44.540 align:middle line:84%
It begins with the
evidence but then

00:27:44.540 --> 00:27:47.690 align:middle line:84%
it basically integrates
traditional spiritual

00:27:47.690 --> 00:27:50.630 align:middle line:84%
understandings of
reincarnation, which basically

00:27:50.630 --> 00:27:54.800 align:middle line:84%
mean that we live,
we die, we return

00:27:54.800 --> 00:27:56.930 align:middle line:84%
to some type of
spiritual existence.

00:27:56.930 --> 00:28:00.350 align:middle line:84%
We incarnate, we get small,
we die we go back to soul.

00:28:00.350 --> 00:28:02.630 align:middle line:90%
We incarnate, we keep this up.

00:28:02.630 --> 00:28:04.970 align:middle line:84%
And in that process, we
live and change and grow.

00:28:04.970 --> 00:28:06.440 align:middle line:90%
We challenge ourselves.

00:28:06.440 --> 00:28:09.050 align:middle line:84%
We go through all
sorts of stages.

00:28:09.050 --> 00:28:12.020 align:middle line:84%
But basically in the
traditional vision,

00:28:12.020 --> 00:28:15.470 align:middle line:84%
the story culminates in
enlightenment, some type

00:28:15.470 --> 00:28:16.880 align:middle line:90%
of spiritual awakening.

00:28:16.880 --> 00:28:20.600 align:middle line:84%
And once one has that awakening,
once one knows who one is,

00:28:20.600 --> 00:28:24.830 align:middle line:84%
what one is, that we are a
divine being, in essence,

00:28:24.830 --> 00:28:27.320 align:middle line:90%
then moksha, escape.

00:28:27.320 --> 00:28:28.730 align:middle line:90%
Then we leave the planet.

00:28:28.730 --> 00:28:34.010 align:middle line:84%
We-- nirvana-- we
no longer incarnate

00:28:34.010 --> 00:28:37.650 align:middle line:84%
inside time and space, which
means that time and space is

00:28:37.650 --> 00:28:40.560 align:middle line:84%
basically just a training
ground that we want

00:28:40.560 --> 00:28:43.470 align:middle line:84%
to leave and
participate in some kind

00:28:43.470 --> 00:28:47.280 align:middle line:84%
of extraplanetary
spiritual paradise.

00:28:47.280 --> 00:28:51.992 align:middle line:84%
And my experience
was that wasn't true.

00:28:51.992 --> 00:28:53.700 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: Yes, I
found that fascinating.

00:28:53.700 --> 00:28:55.830 align:middle line:84%
Go ahead and talk about
what you did find.

00:28:55.830 --> 00:28:59.340 align:middle line:84%
>> BACHE: What I found, I went
through one particular session

00:28:59.340 --> 00:29:03.780 align:middle line:84%
where all of my former lives
began to come back into me.

00:29:03.780 --> 00:29:08.400 align:middle line:84%
It was like winding a kite
string around a kite spool.

00:29:08.400 --> 00:29:12.270 align:middle line:84%
They were coming in very
quickly and they reached a point

00:29:12.270 --> 00:29:16.980 align:middle line:84%
where they fused into one,
all of those former lives,

00:29:16.980 --> 00:29:20.220 align:middle line:84%
thousands of years of
experience fused into one.

00:29:20.220 --> 00:29:23.670 align:middle line:84%
When they fused into one, there
was a tremendous explosion

00:29:23.670 --> 00:29:26.280 align:middle line:84%
of diamond light
from my heart, and I

00:29:26.280 --> 00:29:29.070 align:middle line:84%
was thrown into a state of
consciousness that was deeper

00:29:29.070 --> 00:29:32.410 align:middle line:84%
than anything I had been into
up to that point in time.

00:29:32.410 --> 00:29:35.280 align:middle line:84%
And I was giving a long
series of teachings

00:29:35.280 --> 00:29:38.180 align:middle line:84%
about reincarnation
that went on for hours.

00:29:38.180 --> 00:29:42.380 align:middle line:84%
And the basic vision is it's
not about achieving realization

00:29:42.380 --> 00:29:44.270 align:middle line:90%
and then leaving.

00:29:44.270 --> 00:29:48.170 align:middle line:84%
And it's not even about
just achieving realization,

00:29:48.170 --> 00:29:52.820 align:middle line:84%
the fusing of all of those lives
into a singular intelligence

00:29:52.820 --> 00:29:56.690 align:middle line:84%
which is individual like ego
but not structured like ego,

00:29:56.690 --> 00:29:59.450 align:middle line:84%
much, much larger,
deeper, much more porous,

00:29:59.450 --> 00:30:03.410 align:middle line:84%
and in constant communion
with a larger surrounding

00:30:03.410 --> 00:30:04.730 align:middle line:90%
consciousness.

00:30:04.730 --> 00:30:08.690 align:middle line:90%
That being is soul incarnate.

00:30:08.690 --> 00:30:10.520 align:middle line:84%
I call it the birth
of the diamond soul.

00:30:10.520 --> 00:30:13.110 align:middle line:84%
People refer to it
in different ways.

00:30:13.110 --> 00:30:15.980 align:middle line:84%
I think we are going
through a process of history

00:30:15.980 --> 00:30:18.290 align:middle line:84%
where we've been
incarnating and we've

00:30:18.290 --> 00:30:21.600 align:middle line:84%
been developing for thousands
and thousands of years.

00:30:21.600 --> 00:30:25.970 align:middle line:84%
We're coming to a point where
the human species can no longer

00:30:25.970 --> 00:30:28.760 align:middle line:84%
afford the luxury of
being as ignorant,

00:30:28.760 --> 00:30:30.990 align:middle line:84%
being as small as
we've been in the past.

00:30:30.990 --> 00:30:32.330 align:middle line:90%
We must wake up.

00:30:32.330 --> 00:30:35.420 align:middle line:84%
And the form that this
waking up takes, I think,

00:30:35.420 --> 00:30:38.190 align:middle line:84%
is the birth of the
diamond soul in history.

00:30:38.190 --> 00:30:40.980 align:middle line:84%
The soul is literally
becoming incarnate,

00:30:40.980 --> 00:30:46.050 align:middle line:84%
literally heaven is coming
down into Earth in our bodies,

00:30:46.050 --> 00:30:48.730 align:middle line:84%
and is continuing to
evolve our bodies.

00:30:48.730 --> 00:30:51.690 align:middle line:84%
Not just opening our hearts
and opening our minds,

00:30:51.690 --> 00:30:55.602 align:middle line:84%
but literally changing
how our senses operate.

00:30:55.602 --> 00:30:58.185 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: And you actually had
an experience of that as well.

00:30:58.185 --> 00:30:58.985 align:middle line:90%
>> BACHE: Yeah.

00:30:58.985 --> 00:31:02.190 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: And OK, so
let's move from there.

00:31:02.190 --> 00:31:06.860 align:middle line:84%
I love the fact that you got to
this point of this, A, oneness,

00:31:06.860 --> 00:31:08.660 align:middle line:84%
which was an
interesting realization.

00:31:08.660 --> 00:31:10.220 align:middle line:90%
Yes, we're part of something.

00:31:10.220 --> 00:31:14.390 align:middle line:84%
But so many people believe
in the spiritual communities,

00:31:14.390 --> 00:31:18.770 align:middle line:84%
in general, also that
in Christianity you

00:31:18.770 --> 00:31:21.500 align:middle line:84%
sit on the right hand of
God and you live forever

00:31:21.500 --> 00:31:24.770 align:middle line:84%
in this wonderful
cosmological heaven.

00:31:24.770 --> 00:31:28.730 align:middle line:84%
In other systems, you go into
the sea of oneness and now

00:31:28.730 --> 00:31:30.860 align:middle line:90%
you dissolve into one--

00:31:30.860 --> 00:31:31.730 align:middle line:90%
into oneness.

00:31:31.730 --> 00:31:32.530 align:middle line:90%
And that's it.

00:31:32.530 --> 00:31:33.470 align:middle line:90%
That's the end.

00:31:33.470 --> 00:31:37.040 align:middle line:84%
What you found out is that's
not it, that's not the end.

00:31:37.040 --> 00:31:38.750 align:middle line:84%
And the way you
said it, it does not

00:31:38.750 --> 00:31:41.250 align:middle line:84%
exhaust all of the
cosmological truths.

00:31:41.250 --> 00:31:42.050 align:middle line:90%
>> BACHE: Yeah.

00:31:42.050 --> 00:31:43.770 align:middle line:90%
Oneness is a great truth.

00:31:43.770 --> 00:31:46.310 align:middle line:84%
I mean, it's a profound
truth because in oneness we

00:31:46.310 --> 00:31:49.190 align:middle line:84%
learn who we are, we
learn what we are.

00:31:49.190 --> 00:31:52.490 align:middle line:84%
But that doesn't
end the adventure.

00:31:52.490 --> 00:31:54.690 align:middle line:84%
First, there are many,
many levels of oneness

00:31:54.690 --> 00:31:57.130 align:middle line:84%
and different degrees
of intensity of oneness,

00:31:57.130 --> 00:31:59.460 align:middle line:84%
but it doesn't
end the adventure.

00:31:59.460 --> 00:32:02.820 align:middle line:84%
It's like a stage
in our process.

00:32:02.820 --> 00:32:05.070 align:middle line:84%
Yes, oneness is a
fundamental truth.

00:32:05.070 --> 00:32:07.140 align:middle line:90%
Yes, oneness is what we are.

00:32:07.140 --> 00:32:09.900 align:middle line:84%
But the adventure
that the divine is on,

00:32:09.900 --> 00:32:15.090 align:middle line:84%
the adventure of creation, the
adventure of 13.7 billion years

00:32:15.090 --> 00:32:18.570 align:middle line:84%
followed by how many more
hundreds of billion years, this

00:32:18.570 --> 00:32:23.250 align:middle line:84%
is a project which is much
larger than simply growing

00:32:23.250 --> 00:32:26.370 align:middle line:84%
a species to the point where
it can begin to understand

00:32:26.370 --> 00:32:28.260 align:middle line:90%
oneness, and then it stops?

00:32:28.260 --> 00:32:30.660 align:middle line:90%
No, it keeps going.

00:32:30.660 --> 00:32:31.900 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: It keeps going.

00:32:31.900 --> 00:32:33.570 align:middle line:84%
So we're not just
looking for that.

00:32:33.570 --> 00:32:35.200 align:middle line:90%
It's not over yet then.

00:32:35.200 --> 00:32:36.000 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:32:36.000 --> 00:32:38.910 align:middle line:84%
We're going to move forward
then to session number 55

00:32:38.910 --> 00:32:41.040 align:middle line:84%
which you call the
great awakening.

00:32:41.040 --> 00:32:44.310 align:middle line:84%
Everything now for
humanity starts changing.

00:32:44.310 --> 00:32:46.620 align:middle line:84%
And now we're moving
into the future.

00:32:46.620 --> 00:32:48.740 align:middle line:90%
Let's talk about what you saw.

00:32:48.740 --> 00:32:49.540 align:middle line:90%
>> BACHE: This is--

00:32:49.540 --> 00:32:52.140 align:middle line:84%
I summarized all the
visions that I've

00:32:52.140 --> 00:32:54.630 align:middle line:84%
been given over many years
in one chapter called

00:32:54.630 --> 00:32:56.280 align:middle line:90%
"The Birth of the Future Human."

00:32:56.280 --> 00:33:00.300 align:middle line:84%
And this is visions going
back from '91 to '95,

00:33:00.300 --> 00:33:01.920 align:middle line:90%
so it's a long time ago.

00:33:01.920 --> 00:33:04.770 align:middle line:84%
And I was given many
visions that humanity

00:33:04.770 --> 00:33:06.360 align:middle line:90%
was coming to a turning point.

00:33:06.360 --> 00:33:10.230 align:middle line:84%
Humanity was coming to a radical
profound spiritual awakening

00:33:10.230 --> 00:33:13.170 align:middle line:84%
collectively, that we
were being taken into this

00:33:13.170 --> 00:33:15.750 align:middle line:84%
by the forces of evolution,
the forces of nature,

00:33:15.750 --> 00:33:16.995 align:middle line:90%
the forces of the divine.

00:33:16.995 --> 00:33:19.560 align:middle line:90%


00:33:19.560 --> 00:33:26.040 align:middle line:84%
And then in session
55, I experienced

00:33:26.040 --> 00:33:27.600 align:middle line:90%
how we would get there.

00:33:27.600 --> 00:33:31.050 align:middle line:84%
I experienced the death
and rebirth of humanity.

00:33:31.050 --> 00:33:35.970 align:middle line:84%
First, I dissolved into the
collective psyche which I had

00:33:35.970 --> 00:33:37.690 align:middle line:90%
done many times at that point.

00:33:37.690 --> 00:33:39.820 align:middle line:90%
And I was taken into deep time.

00:33:39.820 --> 00:33:41.850 align:middle line:90%
So I was taken into future time.

00:33:41.850 --> 00:33:48.660 align:middle line:84%
And there, not as Chris space
but as the human species.

00:33:48.660 --> 00:33:52.440 align:middle line:84%
I experienced, I began to
experience a profound collapse

00:33:52.440 --> 00:33:56.220 align:middle line:84%
of reality, a
profound convulsions

00:33:56.220 --> 00:33:58.770 align:middle line:84%
that the entire planet
was going through.

00:33:58.770 --> 00:34:02.880 align:middle line:84%
I experienced a radical loss
of all frames of reference,

00:34:02.880 --> 00:34:06.840 align:middle line:84%
a radical collapsing of all
structures, tremendous fear,

00:34:06.840 --> 00:34:12.239 align:middle line:84%
tremendous uncertainty, a
global systems crisis that

00:34:12.239 --> 00:34:14.880 align:middle line:84%
seemed to be generated
by a cascading

00:34:14.880 --> 00:34:17.730 align:middle line:90%
series of ecological crises.

00:34:17.730 --> 00:34:22.739 align:middle line:84%
Just bringing us to our knees to
the point where we were reduced

00:34:22.739 --> 00:34:25.407 align:middle line:90%
to simply trying to survive.

00:34:25.407 --> 00:34:27.699 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: I think a lot of
people are relating to that

00:34:27.699 --> 00:34:31.430 align:middle line:84%
right now, feeling
like, has that begun?

00:34:31.430 --> 00:34:32.230 align:middle line:90%
Has it begun?

00:34:32.230 --> 00:34:34.570 align:middle line:84%
It feels like things are
starting to disintegrate.

00:34:34.570 --> 00:34:36.580 align:middle line:84%
Everything that's been
known and familiar

00:34:36.580 --> 00:34:39.370 align:middle line:84%
is crumbling and corrupt
and not working anymore.

00:34:39.370 --> 00:34:42.380 align:middle line:84%
>> BACHE: Just the very
early stages of that process.

00:34:42.380 --> 00:34:44.679 align:middle line:84%
It's almost like an
overture to a symphony

00:34:44.679 --> 00:34:48.070 align:middle line:84%
and the scientists are telling
us very clearly what's ahead.

00:34:48.070 --> 00:34:50.080 align:middle line:84%
They're talking about
rising sea levels.

00:34:50.080 --> 00:34:51.699 align:middle line:84%
They're talking
about destabilization

00:34:51.699 --> 00:34:52.600 align:middle line:90%
of the environment.

00:34:52.600 --> 00:34:54.670 align:middle line:84%
They're talking
about massive hunger

00:34:54.670 --> 00:34:57.730 align:middle line:84%
with breakdown of
agricultural production.

00:34:57.730 --> 00:35:01.210 align:middle line:84%
I mean, we're going into one of
the most convulsive centuries

00:35:01.210 --> 00:35:03.340 align:middle line:84%
that the human race
has ever gone through.

00:35:03.340 --> 00:35:08.710 align:middle line:84%
Never have such crises affected
so many such large percentages

00:35:08.710 --> 00:35:12.100 align:middle line:84%
of the human race and
all at the same time.

00:35:12.100 --> 00:35:13.750 align:middle line:90%
This is going to be--

00:35:13.750 --> 00:35:16.440 align:middle line:84%
it's going to feel
like hell on Earth.

00:35:16.440 --> 00:35:19.740 align:middle line:84%
My experience though, was
that we moved through this.

00:35:19.740 --> 00:35:20.760 align:middle line:90%
We went through this.

00:35:20.760 --> 00:35:22.830 align:middle line:84%
And when we got on
the other side of it

00:35:22.830 --> 00:35:26.340 align:middle line:84%
and began to rebuild our
lives through this process,

00:35:26.340 --> 00:35:29.220 align:middle line:90%
we had been profoundly changed.

00:35:29.220 --> 00:35:32.160 align:middle line:84%
Everywhere, new
values, new estimates

00:35:32.160 --> 00:35:35.340 align:middle line:84%
of the good, new
social relationships,

00:35:35.340 --> 00:35:38.140 align:middle line:84%
a profound change
in human nature.

00:35:38.140 --> 00:35:41.070 align:middle line:84%
And I think what's
happening is it's not simply

00:35:41.070 --> 00:35:45.180 align:middle line:84%
a shift in our government, a
shift in economics or industry,

00:35:45.180 --> 00:35:47.430 align:middle line:84%
even a social shift,
but a shift that's

00:35:47.430 --> 00:35:51.150 align:middle line:84%
reaching so deep it changes
the fundamental architecture

00:35:51.150 --> 00:35:52.710 align:middle line:90%
of the collective psyche.

00:35:52.710 --> 00:35:55.470 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: One of the terms
you used that applies there is

00:35:55.470 --> 00:35:59.040 align:middle line:84%
a kind of a hyper-arousal
of the species mind.

00:35:59.040 --> 00:36:02.280 align:middle line:84%
>> BACHE: In session 55,
one of the things that went

00:36:02.280 --> 00:36:06.330 align:middle line:84%
into in great detail was
how could we possibly change

00:36:06.330 --> 00:36:09.330 align:middle line:84%
as much as we need to change as
quickly as we need to change?

00:36:09.330 --> 00:36:10.840 align:middle line:90%
How is this going to happen?

00:36:10.840 --> 00:36:13.720 align:middle line:84%
And it really focused on
the collective dynamics.

00:36:13.720 --> 00:36:15.940 align:middle line:84%
We have to understand the
collective-- the dynamics

00:36:15.940 --> 00:36:17.590 align:middle line:90%
of the collective species.

00:36:17.590 --> 00:36:20.980 align:middle line:84%
The collective species
mind is a field,

00:36:20.980 --> 00:36:23.770 align:middle line:84%
and we know what
physical fields do

00:36:23.770 --> 00:36:25.720 align:middle line:84%
when they're put under
enormous pressure, when

00:36:25.720 --> 00:36:28.540 align:middle line:84%
they are shoved into
non-equilibrium conditions.

00:36:28.540 --> 00:36:31.510 align:middle line:84%
They're capable of
tremendous creativity.

00:36:31.510 --> 00:36:36.070 align:middle line:84%
Small changes result in
enormous large outputs.

00:36:36.070 --> 00:36:39.850 align:middle line:84%
When the species
mind is energized

00:36:39.850 --> 00:36:43.180 align:middle line:84%
by the suffering of so many of
our children and grandchildren,

00:36:43.180 --> 00:36:45.850 align:middle line:84%
when so many people are
dying and so many people are

00:36:45.850 --> 00:36:48.850 align:middle line:90%
in great distress, the entire--

00:36:48.850 --> 00:36:51.790 align:middle line:84%
it's not just individuals
who are being impacted

00:36:51.790 --> 00:36:54.890 align:middle line:84%
but the entire species
mind is impacted.

00:36:54.890 --> 00:36:58.540 align:middle line:84%
And I think it will shove it
into something approximating

00:36:58.540 --> 00:37:01.690 align:middle line:84%
nonlinear conditions so
that we can learn something

00:37:01.690 --> 00:37:04.720 align:middle line:84%
about what might happen
in the species mind

00:37:04.720 --> 00:37:07.360 align:middle line:84%
by studying what happens
in physical systems

00:37:07.360 --> 00:37:09.460 align:middle line:84%
when they are shoved in
a nonlinear condition.

00:37:09.460 --> 00:37:11.543 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: And we become
very creative, humans do.

00:37:11.543 --> 00:37:14.040 align:middle line:84%
>> BACHE: Very
creative, very small--

00:37:14.040 --> 00:37:17.010 align:middle line:84%
I mean, the impact
of individual actions

00:37:17.010 --> 00:37:19.830 align:middle line:90%
can have enormous consequences.

00:37:19.830 --> 00:37:24.550 align:middle line:84%
Creativity can seemingly
out of nowhere,

00:37:24.550 --> 00:37:27.570 align:middle line:84%
but really coming out of the
foundation of our very being,

00:37:27.570 --> 00:37:28.750 align:middle line:90%
comes forward.

00:37:28.750 --> 00:37:32.610 align:middle line:84%
So this change that
we're going through

00:37:32.610 --> 00:37:36.720 align:middle line:84%
is going to take place much
faster than we could ever

00:37:36.720 --> 00:37:37.792 align:middle line:90%
imagine previously.

00:37:37.792 --> 00:37:39.000 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Which is merciful.

00:37:39.000 --> 00:37:41.940 align:middle line:84%
>> BACHE: Which is merciful,
harsh and merciful,

00:37:41.940 --> 00:37:45.720 align:middle line:84%
and it will because of the
fundamental dynamics of that

00:37:45.720 --> 00:37:48.210 align:middle line:84%
are pushing it from an
underneath the level from

00:37:48.210 --> 00:37:50.760 align:middle line:84%
the collective psychic level,
it will be pushing us there.

00:37:50.760 --> 00:37:52.260 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: And you
say this almost--

00:37:52.260 --> 00:37:55.170 align:middle line:84%
this became kind of
like a crystal in death.

00:37:55.170 --> 00:37:56.850 align:middle line:84%
I mean, there's a
beauty in everything.

00:37:56.850 --> 00:37:59.820 align:middle line:84%
We think, oh death,
yeah, destruction.

00:37:59.820 --> 00:38:02.400 align:middle line:84%
But the fact is when we start
passing through that, that's

00:38:02.400 --> 00:38:03.990 align:middle line:90%
not what we're experiencing.

00:38:03.990 --> 00:38:04.790 align:middle line:90%
>> BACHE: No.

00:38:04.790 --> 00:38:07.680 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: And what you saw
is we just burst into this

00:38:07.680 --> 00:38:11.010 align:middle line:84%
sparkling light of these diamond
souls that have been given

00:38:11.010 --> 00:38:14.170 align:middle line:84%
birth to, that we
have transformed into.

00:38:14.170 --> 00:38:16.420 align:middle line:84%
>> BACHE: I don't know whether
this is going to happen

00:38:16.420 --> 00:38:17.220 align:middle line:90%
suddenly.

00:38:17.220 --> 00:38:19.660 align:middle line:84%
I don't know whether it's
going to be slow and gradual

00:38:19.660 --> 00:38:21.010 align:middle line:90%
as an historical progression.

00:38:21.010 --> 00:38:24.820 align:middle line:84%
I wasn't given any details
of the death process,

00:38:24.820 --> 00:38:26.780 align:middle line:90%
except the experience of it.

00:38:26.780 --> 00:38:29.710 align:middle line:84%
I wasn't given
details of the rebirth

00:38:29.710 --> 00:38:31.570 align:middle line:90%
except the quality of it.

00:38:31.570 --> 00:38:34.010 align:middle line:84%
So I don't know how it's
going to take place.

00:38:34.010 --> 00:38:38.170 align:middle line:84%
But I do think what is happening
is that nature is giving birth

00:38:38.170 --> 00:38:39.670 align:middle line:90%
to the diamond soul.

00:38:39.670 --> 00:38:43.120 align:middle line:90%
It's like gestation is long.

00:38:43.120 --> 00:38:45.070 align:middle line:84%
We've been gestating
the diamond soul

00:38:45.070 --> 00:38:47.410 align:middle line:84%
for thousands and
thousands of years.

00:38:47.410 --> 00:38:51.880 align:middle line:84%
Labor is short, it's intense,
it's dangerous, but it's short

00:38:51.880 --> 00:38:54.340 align:middle line:84%
and I think we are
entering a time of labor.

00:38:54.340 --> 00:38:55.870 align:middle line:90%
How long will it last?

00:38:55.870 --> 00:38:56.890 align:middle line:90%
I don't know.

00:38:56.890 --> 00:38:58.990 align:middle line:90%
I think generations.

00:38:58.990 --> 00:39:00.790 align:middle line:84%
But I think we do
come through it.

00:39:00.790 --> 00:39:03.500 align:middle line:84%
My experience is that we
do make it through it.

00:39:03.500 --> 00:39:06.560 align:middle line:84%
I have experienced
the future human.

00:39:06.560 --> 00:39:09.220 align:middle line:84%
And so for me, it's
not a probability

00:39:09.220 --> 00:39:11.230 align:middle line:84%
that it's going to
happen, it's a certainty

00:39:11.230 --> 00:39:12.680 align:middle line:90%
that it's going to happen.

00:39:12.680 --> 00:39:15.680 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: And you've seen this,
and other seers have seen this.

00:39:15.680 --> 00:39:16.513 align:middle line:90%
>> BACHE: They have.

00:39:16.513 --> 00:39:19.420 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: All of the great
beings that are communicating

00:39:19.420 --> 00:39:23.710 align:middle line:84%
through humanity at this
time all see that we are now

00:39:23.710 --> 00:39:27.100 align:middle line:84%
emerging into something of much
greater potential than what

00:39:27.100 --> 00:39:28.450 align:middle line:90%
we've been limited to.

00:39:28.450 --> 00:39:31.460 align:middle line:84%
It's like the governors and
limiters are coming off.

00:39:31.460 --> 00:39:32.260 align:middle line:90%
>> BACHE: Yeah.

00:39:32.260 --> 00:39:35.320 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: And so before we
wrap up the conversation,

00:39:35.320 --> 00:39:38.530 align:middle line:84%
believe it or not, I've
got 54 questions here,

00:39:38.530 --> 00:39:40.210 align:middle line:90%
we only took a handful.

00:39:40.210 --> 00:39:42.640 align:middle line:84%
I wanted to get to
this part and that

00:39:42.640 --> 00:39:46.870 align:middle line:84%
was what nirvana, the
way you describe nirvana

00:39:46.870 --> 00:39:51.010 align:middle line:84%
in the book, which is, as you
said before, it's not like we

00:39:51.010 --> 00:39:53.650 align:middle line:84%
just go to the right
hand of a cosmic force,

00:39:53.650 --> 00:39:55.840 align:middle line:84%
it's not as though we
float into oneness,

00:39:55.840 --> 00:39:58.150 align:middle line:84%
it's not as though we
have to leave the planet

00:39:58.150 --> 00:40:01.870 align:middle line:84%
to be able to transform
and experience us.

00:40:01.870 --> 00:40:04.390 align:middle line:84%
You said, "nirvana
in every second.

00:40:04.390 --> 00:40:08.170 align:middle line:84%
Nirvana is paying
complete attention.

00:40:08.170 --> 00:40:11.830 align:middle line:84%
If you lose attention and
fall out of the moment,

00:40:11.830 --> 00:40:14.030 align:middle line:90%
suffering begins again."

00:40:14.030 --> 00:40:14.830 align:middle line:90%
>> BACHE: Yeah.

00:40:14.830 --> 00:40:17.413 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: Let's talk about that
because that's something each

00:40:17.413 --> 00:40:21.820 align:middle line:84%
and every one of us have
some ability or potential

00:40:21.820 --> 00:40:27.960 align:middle line:84%
to experience or manage
at this point in time.

00:40:27.960 --> 00:40:29.603 align:middle line:84%
>> BACHE: Wow, so
many layers to that.

00:40:29.603 --> 00:40:31.020 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: We've
got four minutes.

00:40:31.020 --> 00:40:31.820 align:middle line:90%
>> BACHE: Yeah.

00:40:31.820 --> 00:40:38.940 align:middle line:84%
[LAUGHS] Nirvana is
simply the experience

00:40:38.940 --> 00:40:41.850 align:middle line:84%
of what people refer to as
nirvana or enlightenment

00:40:41.850 --> 00:40:44.430 align:middle line:84%
or awakening, is
simply awakening

00:40:44.430 --> 00:40:49.170 align:middle line:84%
to the fundamental core
of our essential nature.

00:40:49.170 --> 00:40:51.150 align:middle line:84%
The nature that's
never been changed

00:40:51.150 --> 00:40:54.180 align:middle line:84%
from years before
this incarnation,

00:40:54.180 --> 00:40:55.890 align:middle line:90%
will never be changed after.

00:40:55.890 --> 00:41:00.180 align:middle line:84%
It is the fundamental nature
of our divine reality,

00:41:00.180 --> 00:41:04.620 align:middle line:90%
of our infinite reality.

00:41:04.620 --> 00:41:09.180 align:middle line:84%
And on top of that, within
that, our physical life emerges,

00:41:09.180 --> 00:41:13.350 align:middle line:84%
our personality emerges, our
individual awareness emerges.

00:41:13.350 --> 00:41:15.870 align:middle line:84%
If we're paying very
close attention,

00:41:15.870 --> 00:41:21.360 align:middle line:84%
one can experience one's
life as a dance of finite--

00:41:21.360 --> 00:41:24.690 align:middle line:84%
our finite life as a dance
on the infinite nature

00:41:24.690 --> 00:41:26.410 align:middle line:90%
of our essential nature.

00:41:26.410 --> 00:41:29.370 align:middle line:84%
If we stop paying
attention, then it's

00:41:29.370 --> 00:41:33.190 align:middle line:84%
like the infinite nature
disappears and we resume

00:41:33.190 --> 00:41:37.240 align:middle line:84%
and we're trapped again in the
finite structures of our life.

00:41:37.240 --> 00:41:39.120 align:middle line:84%
But then if we
just relax and tune

00:41:39.120 --> 00:41:41.370 align:middle line:84%
into that infinite
structure, it doesn't

00:41:41.370 --> 00:41:44.160 align:middle line:84%
dissolve those finite
structures but they

00:41:44.160 --> 00:41:48.120 align:middle line:84%
become transparent to that
infinite reality that's

00:41:48.120 --> 00:41:49.500 align:middle line:90%
always there underneath.

00:41:49.500 --> 00:41:51.060 align:middle line:84%
It was there the
moment we were born.

00:41:51.060 --> 00:41:52.000 align:middle line:90%
It doesn't change.

00:41:52.000 --> 00:41:53.530 align:middle line:90%
It's there the day that we die.

00:41:53.530 --> 00:41:54.660 align:middle line:90%
It's always there.

00:41:54.660 --> 00:41:58.840 align:middle line:84%
It's the nature of reality
that sustains all existence.

00:41:58.840 --> 00:42:04.240 align:middle line:84%
That to pay attention to it,
we don't create that reality,

00:42:04.240 --> 00:42:06.040 align:middle line:90%
we don't bring it into being.

00:42:06.040 --> 00:42:10.690 align:middle line:84%
We simply awaken to it's already
continuously existing presence.

00:42:10.690 --> 00:42:13.520 align:middle line:90%


00:42:13.520 --> 00:42:15.740 align:middle line:84%
And to learn to live
in that condition,

00:42:15.740 --> 00:42:19.490 align:middle line:84%
to learn to live with
both of those realities

00:42:19.490 --> 00:42:22.190 align:middle line:84%
leads to a deeper and
deeper integration

00:42:22.190 --> 00:42:25.130 align:middle line:90%
of the infinite and the finite.

00:42:25.130 --> 00:42:28.260 align:middle line:84%
And the qualities, it's
not just an awareness

00:42:28.260 --> 00:42:32.330 align:middle line:84%
but the power of the
infinite saturating

00:42:32.330 --> 00:42:34.400 align:middle line:90%
the structures of the finite.

00:42:34.400 --> 00:42:38.750 align:middle line:84%
The clarity, the compassion
of the infinite saturating

00:42:38.750 --> 00:42:41.590 align:middle line:90%
the structures of the finite.

00:42:41.590 --> 00:42:44.560 align:middle line:84%
That's where creation
is taking us.

00:42:44.560 --> 00:42:49.390 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: And that means being
aware and awake in the moment

00:42:49.390 --> 00:42:52.220 align:middle line:84%
instead of living in the past
and living in the future,

00:42:52.220 --> 00:42:56.560 align:middle line:84%
which I think according to
some neuroscientific studies,

00:42:56.560 --> 00:42:59.050 align:middle line:84%
humans do probably
90% of the time.

00:42:59.050 --> 00:43:01.420 align:middle line:84%
Either dreaming into the
future, fearing the future,

00:43:01.420 --> 00:43:02.680 align:middle line:90%
or fearing the past.

00:43:02.680 --> 00:43:05.230 align:middle line:84%
And missing these
precious moments

00:43:05.230 --> 00:43:08.410 align:middle line:84%
that are companionship
of our own soul

00:43:08.410 --> 00:43:11.140 align:middle line:84%
is guiding us to this,
all this divine kind

00:43:11.140 --> 00:43:15.370 align:middle line:84%
of timing happening to take
us into this conversation.

00:43:15.370 --> 00:43:19.360 align:middle line:84%
Lunch next with people,
all these things, and we're

00:43:19.360 --> 00:43:21.230 align:middle line:84%
looking at our
devices and thinking

00:43:21.230 --> 00:43:23.120 align:middle line:84%
of where we got to be
at the end of the day.

00:43:23.120 --> 00:43:25.030 align:middle line:84%
To me, it seems
that that's the part

00:43:25.030 --> 00:43:27.400 align:middle line:84%
we have to start gaining
some mastery over.

00:43:27.400 --> 00:43:28.290 align:middle line:90%
Be here.

00:43:28.290 --> 00:43:29.090 align:middle line:90%
>> BACHE: Yeah.

00:43:29.090 --> 00:43:33.910 align:middle line:84%
Yeah, just sort of settling into
the present because tomorrow

00:43:33.910 --> 00:43:37.330 align:middle line:84%
is just another series of
presents, of present moments.

00:43:37.330 --> 00:43:39.490 align:middle line:10%
It's all just a
series and it's not

00:43:39.490 --> 00:43:43.160 align:middle line:10%
going to be tomorrow is
present, it's not richer

00:43:43.160 --> 00:43:44.670 align:middle line:10%
than today's present.

00:43:44.670 --> 00:43:46.310 align:middle line:90%
It's always right here.

00:43:46.310 --> 00:43:49.940 align:middle line:84%
And it's also we either
tune into it or we miss it.

00:43:49.940 --> 00:43:51.920 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: And we don't
need to die for that.

00:43:51.920 --> 00:43:54.380 align:middle line:84%
Nirvana is right
here for the taking.

00:43:54.380 --> 00:43:56.390 align:middle line:84%
>> BACHE: Right here,
right now, yeah.

00:43:56.390 --> 00:43:58.140 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: Christopher,
thank you so much.

00:43:58.140 --> 00:44:00.050 align:middle line:90%
I mean, I so enjoyed your book.

00:44:00.050 --> 00:44:02.042 align:middle line:84%
I've shared it with
many, many people.

00:44:02.042 --> 00:44:03.500 align:middle line:84%
Many people watching
this are going

00:44:03.500 --> 00:44:05.610 align:middle line:84%
to want to look into
these experiences, too.

00:44:05.610 --> 00:44:08.420 align:middle line:84%
They're very richly
illustrated to the degree

00:44:08.420 --> 00:44:10.673 align:middle line:84%
that you can articulate
it with human words.

00:44:10.673 --> 00:44:11.840 align:middle line:90%
>> BACHE: Thank you, Regina.

00:44:11.840 --> 00:44:14.280 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: And again, I thank
you so much for your decades

00:44:14.280 --> 00:44:15.080 align:middle line:90%
of devotion.

00:44:15.080 --> 00:44:18.110 align:middle line:84%
And it took you another 20 years
before you decided that you

00:44:18.110 --> 00:44:19.710 align:middle line:90%
would share these experiences.

00:44:19.710 --> 00:44:20.120 align:middle line:90%

00:44:20.120 --> 00:44:21.537 align:middle line:10%

of experience,

00:44:21.537 --> 00:44:25.770 align:middle line:10%
20 years on pause to decide
how to best bring this forward

00:44:25.770 --> 00:44:26.570 align:middle line:10%
and digest--

00:44:26.570 --> 00:44:27.920 align:middle line:10%
>> BACHE: To digest
them, to assimilate them.

00:44:27.920 --> 00:44:30.050 align:middle line:10%
Yeah, and then it took
me a long time just

00:44:30.050 --> 00:44:33.353 align:middle line:10%
to be able to share such
intimate experiences.

00:44:33.353 --> 00:44:35.270 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: Oh, yeah,
there's so much in there.

00:44:35.270 --> 00:44:37.340 align:middle line:84%
Some of it's so
deeply personal, we

00:44:37.340 --> 00:44:38.720 align:middle line:90%
didn't go into a lot of that.

00:44:38.720 --> 00:44:40.598 align:middle line:90%
So anyway, thank you again.

consider to be an absolute

00:44:53.120 --> 00:44:54.230 align:middle line:10%
must-read book.
