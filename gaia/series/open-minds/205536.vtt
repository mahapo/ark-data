00:00:09.140 --> 00:00:11.610 align:middle line:84%
>>CAROLINE CORY: What
happened when I was five,

00:00:11.610 --> 00:00:13.530 align:middle line:90%
this group of beings showed up.

00:00:13.530 --> 00:00:15.960 align:middle line:84%
They are more of light
beings, but I could also

00:00:15.960 --> 00:00:18.930 align:middle line:90%
see what was wrong with someone.

00:00:18.930 --> 00:00:20.610 align:middle line:84%
If they were struggling
with something,

00:00:20.610 --> 00:00:23.520 align:middle line:84%
I could see what was going to
happen to them the next day.

00:00:23.520 --> 00:00:26.100 align:middle line:84%
I could see what was on
the other side of the wall.

00:00:26.100 --> 00:00:29.670 align:middle line:84%
We would do this
experiment live on camera.

00:00:29.670 --> 00:00:32.920 align:middle line:84%
I wanted to show that
anybody could do this.

00:00:32.920 --> 00:00:36.840 align:middle line:84%
The fact that she could do
it under those conditions,

00:00:36.840 --> 00:00:38.178 align:middle line:90%
the crew was blown away.

00:00:38.178 --> 00:00:39.720 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA MEREDITH:
Also another thing

00:00:39.720 --> 00:00:43.730 align:middle line:84%
you talk about is being able
to see while blindfolded.

00:00:43.730 --> 00:00:46.770 align:middle line:84%
>>CORY: I found those
children in the UK,

00:00:46.770 --> 00:00:48.810 align:middle line:90%
I think about four years ago.

00:00:48.810 --> 00:00:50.230 align:middle line:90%
I tried it myself.

00:00:50.230 --> 00:00:52.530 align:middle line:90%
And there's nothing fake.

00:00:52.530 --> 00:00:53.790 align:middle line:90%
They weren't cheating.

00:00:53.790 --> 00:00:57.070 align:middle line:84%
And I would write something
on it so they had no idea.

00:00:57.070 --> 00:01:01.035 align:middle line:84%
And they could see everything
completely blindfolded.

00:01:01.035 --> 00:01:02.796 align:middle line:90%

00:01:06.740 --> 00:01:08.750 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: The mind is
our most powerful tool,

00:01:08.750 --> 00:01:10.070 align:middle line:90%
for better or worse.

00:01:10.070 --> 00:01:12.380 align:middle line:10%
We've seen a great deal
of both in recent times.

00:01:12.380 --> 00:01:16.160 align:middle line:10%
And since we're clearly going
through an evolutionary stage,

00:01:16.160 --> 00:01:19.160 align:middle line:10%
how about if we begin to
develop our superhuman mind?

00:01:19.160 --> 00:01:21.020 align:middle line:84%
Caroline Cory and I
are going to be talking

00:01:21.020 --> 00:01:22.520 align:middle line:84%
about the practical
elements of how

00:01:22.520 --> 00:01:25.880 align:middle line:84%
to use our mind to a much
higher effect, such as healing

00:01:25.880 --> 00:01:28.970 align:middle line:84%
of self, and others,
and much, much more.

00:01:28.970 --> 00:01:30.080 align:middle line:90%
Welcome, Caroline.

00:01:30.080 --> 00:01:31.340 align:middle line:90%
>>CORY: Thanks for having me.

00:01:31.340 --> 00:01:31.940 align:middle line:90%
How are you?

00:01:31.940 --> 00:01:32.570 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: I'm good.

00:01:32.570 --> 00:01:32.920 align:middle line:90%
Thank you.

00:01:32.920 --> 00:01:35.545 align:middle line:84%
I think this is going to be fun,
because one of the things that

00:01:35.545 --> 00:01:38.660 align:middle line:84%
I really truly believe-- and
you and I are on the same page--

00:01:38.660 --> 00:01:43.340 align:middle line:84%
is that developing the
ability to truly use

00:01:43.340 --> 00:01:46.640 align:middle line:84%
our multidimensional
mind takes care

00:01:46.640 --> 00:01:48.380 align:middle line:84%
of the subject we're
grappling with,

00:01:48.380 --> 00:01:52.490 align:middle line:84%
which is how do
we discern truth?

00:01:52.490 --> 00:01:56.090 align:middle line:84%
Truth is elusive if we
can't use our full mind

00:01:56.090 --> 00:01:57.450 align:middle line:90%
for a lot of people.

00:01:57.450 --> 00:01:59.480 align:middle line:84%
And so that's just
one of many ways

00:01:59.480 --> 00:02:01.590 align:middle line:84%
we're going to talk about
using the mind today.

00:02:01.590 --> 00:02:03.830 align:middle line:84%
But for me, that's a
really big one right now.

00:02:03.830 --> 00:02:05.390 align:middle line:84%
When we get to
the point where we

00:02:05.390 --> 00:02:07.390 align:middle line:84%
can use our mind to the
extent where we can't be

00:02:07.390 --> 00:02:08.240 align:middle line:90%
lied to anymore.

00:02:08.240 --> 00:02:09.139 align:middle line:90%
>>CORY: Absolutely.

00:02:09.139 --> 00:02:10.039 align:middle line:90%
I agree.

00:02:10.039 --> 00:02:12.890 align:middle line:10%
Because what happens is when
you can discern the truth,

00:02:12.890 --> 00:02:14.310 align:middle line:10%
then you're free.

00:02:14.310 --> 00:02:15.950 align:middle line:84%
You don't need someone
outside yourself

00:02:15.950 --> 00:02:18.000 align:middle line:90%
to tell you what to believe in.

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:18.800 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Exactly.

00:02:18.800 --> 00:02:21.350 align:middle line:84%
And we've seen what's happened
to the world as of late.

00:02:21.350 --> 00:02:23.480 align:middle line:90%
And it's been a crisis in truth.

00:02:23.480 --> 00:02:25.010 align:middle line:84%
I mean, there's a
deficit of truth.

00:02:25.010 --> 00:02:28.400 align:middle line:84%
And there are a lot of
larger cycle reasons for it,

00:02:28.400 --> 00:02:32.690 align:middle line:84%
but the reality is it's a real
call and opportunity for us

00:02:32.690 --> 00:02:34.880 align:middle line:84%
to rise to the
occasion of learning

00:02:34.880 --> 00:02:39.200 align:middle line:84%
how to find real centered truth
and discernment in our lives.

00:02:39.200 --> 00:02:41.390 align:middle line:90%
So that's my special desire.

00:02:41.390 --> 00:02:44.430 align:middle line:84%
But meanwhile, we want everyone
to get to know you a bit.

00:02:44.430 --> 00:02:46.820 align:middle line:84%
So you've done some
really wonderful things.

00:02:46.820 --> 00:02:49.642 align:middle line:84%
You're quite skilled
in some of these areas

00:02:49.642 --> 00:02:50.600 align:middle line:90%
we'll be talking about.

00:02:50.600 --> 00:02:52.080 align:middle line:90%
You've had experiences.

00:02:52.080 --> 00:02:56.360 align:middle line:84%
So how did you get on this
path of the deep study of mind

00:02:56.360 --> 00:02:58.680 align:middle line:90%
over our material world?

00:02:58.680 --> 00:03:02.340 align:middle line:84%
>>CORY: So what happened
when I was five years old,

00:03:02.340 --> 00:03:05.270 align:middle line:84%
I had a first experience
where I realized

00:03:05.270 --> 00:03:07.370 align:middle line:90%
I could see the subtle energy.

00:03:07.370 --> 00:03:09.170 align:middle line:84%
I could see beings,
but I can also

00:03:09.170 --> 00:03:12.140 align:middle line:90%
see what was wrong with someone.

00:03:12.140 --> 00:03:13.820 align:middle line:84%
If they were struggling
with something,

00:03:13.820 --> 00:03:17.540 align:middle line:84%
I could see what was going to
happen to them the next day.

00:03:17.540 --> 00:03:20.210 align:middle line:84%
I could see what was on the
other side of the wall, things

00:03:20.210 --> 00:03:21.920 align:middle line:90%
like that.

00:03:21.920 --> 00:03:23.400 align:middle line:90%
And I'm five years old, right?

00:03:23.400 --> 00:03:25.640 align:middle line:84%
So I didn't think it
was anything special.

00:03:25.640 --> 00:03:28.190 align:middle line:84%
In fact, I thought
all children did that.

00:03:28.190 --> 00:03:30.510 align:middle line:90%
So I never talked about it.

00:03:30.510 --> 00:03:33.710 align:middle line:84%
And because of that, I
wanted to kind of understand

00:03:33.710 --> 00:03:35.490 align:middle line:90%
what was happening.

00:03:35.490 --> 00:03:38.570 align:middle line:84%
How do you tap into
information you

00:03:38.570 --> 00:03:40.640 align:middle line:90%
didn't know about beforehand?

00:03:40.640 --> 00:03:44.120 align:middle line:84%
And so that is how I got on
the journey of consciousness,

00:03:44.120 --> 00:03:46.190 align:middle line:90%
the mechanics of consciousness.

00:03:46.190 --> 00:03:52.520 align:middle line:84%
What did my mind, or my brain
even, have to do to get there?

00:03:52.520 --> 00:03:56.300 align:middle line:84%
Because the point is not just
for me to be able to do that,

00:03:56.300 --> 00:04:00.620 align:middle line:84%
but to be able to share
it and to, potentially,

00:04:00.620 --> 00:04:03.590 align:middle line:84%
teach it or help others
do the same thing.

00:04:03.590 --> 00:04:06.950 align:middle line:84%
Because I realized that
a lot of information

00:04:06.950 --> 00:04:08.780 align:middle line:84%
is on the other
side of the veil,

00:04:08.780 --> 00:04:10.920 align:middle line:84%
on the invisible
side of the veil.

00:04:10.920 --> 00:04:13.580 align:middle line:84%
And so it was crucial
for our understanding

00:04:13.580 --> 00:04:15.360 align:middle line:90%
of who we really are.

00:04:15.360 --> 00:04:16.948 align:middle line:90%
And that's how I got into--

00:04:16.948 --> 00:04:18.740 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So you must
have started studying

00:04:18.740 --> 00:04:20.510 align:middle line:90%
this quite a young age?

00:04:20.510 --> 00:04:21.829 align:middle line:90%
>>CORY: Yes, absolutely.

00:04:21.829 --> 00:04:25.770 align:middle line:84%
Well it was more experiences
that would happen to me.

00:04:25.770 --> 00:04:28.850 align:middle line:84%
And then I would start
asking the question, how can

00:04:28.850 --> 00:04:30.030 align:middle line:90%
I do this again?

00:04:30.030 --> 00:04:31.520 align:middle line:90%
Can I do this again?

00:04:31.520 --> 00:04:34.640 align:middle line:84%
Or more importantly,
did I make it up?

00:04:34.640 --> 00:04:35.720 align:middle line:90%
Am I crazy?

00:04:35.720 --> 00:04:38.090 align:middle line:84%
Like how do I know
this is the truth?

00:04:38.090 --> 00:04:41.420 align:middle line:84%
Because I felt responsible--
how do you tell someone

00:04:41.420 --> 00:04:45.860 align:middle line:84%
I think this is what's going
to heal your migraine headaches

00:04:45.860 --> 00:04:48.500 align:middle line:84%
or something if
you're not right?

00:04:48.500 --> 00:04:50.480 align:middle line:90%
So I felt very responsible.

00:04:50.480 --> 00:04:52.820 align:middle line:84%
And I wanted to really,
really understand

00:04:52.820 --> 00:04:54.920 align:middle line:90%
the mechanics of consciousness.

00:04:54.920 --> 00:04:57.420 align:middle line:84%
It's really how
consciousness works.

00:04:57.420 --> 00:05:00.140 align:middle line:84%
And so I embarked on
this 20-year journey.

00:05:00.140 --> 00:05:02.888 align:middle line:90%
I've written books and taught.

00:05:02.888 --> 00:05:04.430 align:middle line:84%
And also working
with so many people,

00:05:04.430 --> 00:05:06.860 align:middle line:90%
you learn from other people.

00:05:06.860 --> 00:05:12.980 align:middle line:84%
And that's how I kind of
started to understand vibration,

00:05:12.980 --> 00:05:16.237 align:middle line:84%
tapping into other realities,
and so on and so forth.

00:05:16.237 --> 00:05:18.320 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Thank you for
sharing your personal bit.

00:05:18.320 --> 00:05:20.930 align:middle line:84%
But by the way, I mean,
did your parents ultimately

00:05:20.930 --> 00:05:22.940 align:middle line:84%
understand that you
were able to see

00:05:22.940 --> 00:05:24.440 align:middle line:90%
beyond the normal capacities?

00:05:24.440 --> 00:05:26.780 align:middle line:84%
And did you ever
blurt things out

00:05:26.780 --> 00:05:30.530 align:middle line:84%
or say things to them
that made you stand out

00:05:30.530 --> 00:05:33.230 align:middle line:84%
and made them, perhaps,
question you a little bit?

00:05:33.230 --> 00:05:35.750 align:middle line:84%
>>CORY: To be honest,
I never shared anything

00:05:35.750 --> 00:05:39.110 align:middle line:84%
because I wasn't sure what
I was doing, you know?

00:05:39.110 --> 00:05:41.133 align:middle line:84%
And I felt like all
children did that--

00:05:41.133 --> 00:05:42.800 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So it wasn't
worth mentioning.

00:05:42.800 --> 00:05:43.440 align:middle line:90%
>>CORY: Yeah, yeah, yeah.

00:05:43.440 --> 00:05:45.140 align:middle line:84%
And actually that
was a good thing.

00:05:45.140 --> 00:05:48.500 align:middle line:84%
Because if I had mentioned
it to my parents,

00:05:48.500 --> 00:05:50.300 align:middle line:84%
probably they would
have said stop that.

00:05:50.300 --> 00:05:51.100 align:middle line:90%
Don't go there.

00:05:51.100 --> 00:05:52.642 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: They could
have interfered.

00:05:52.642 --> 00:05:54.650 align:middle line:84%
>>CORY: Yeah, you don't
have invisible friends.

00:05:54.650 --> 00:05:57.050 align:middle line:90%
Stop talking to no one.

00:05:57.050 --> 00:06:01.550 align:middle line:84%
And so I'm, in fact, very happy
that I never shared anything.

00:06:01.550 --> 00:06:05.060 align:middle line:84%
And actually, it was
the other way around.

00:06:05.060 --> 00:06:09.700 align:middle line:84%
I went deeper into what was
happening inside of my being

00:06:09.700 --> 00:06:13.720 align:middle line:84%
to try to figure out how this
could be possible, how I could,

00:06:13.720 --> 00:06:15.070 align:middle line:90%
again--

00:06:15.070 --> 00:06:17.050 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Wishing to do
it again, for example?

00:06:17.050 --> 00:06:17.883 align:middle line:90%
>>CORY: Consciously.

00:06:17.883 --> 00:06:19.000 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:06:19.000 --> 00:06:20.770 align:middle line:84%
A lot of people
have experiences,

00:06:20.770 --> 00:06:22.130 align:middle line:90%
but it kind of happens to them.

00:06:22.130 --> 00:06:22.930 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:06:22.930 --> 00:06:25.600 align:middle line:84%
>>CORY: They get some sort
of download or some sort of--

00:06:25.600 --> 00:06:27.440 align:middle line:84%
but they don't know
how it happened.

00:06:27.440 --> 00:06:31.870 align:middle line:84%
And so I wanted to know if I
could replicate it consciously

00:06:31.870 --> 00:06:34.900 align:middle line:90%
so that others could be helped.

00:06:34.900 --> 00:06:37.430 align:middle line:84%
So that's how it
all came together.

00:06:37.430 --> 00:06:40.240 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So when you're talking
about your invisible friends,

00:06:40.240 --> 00:06:41.040 align:middle line:90%
who were they?

00:06:41.040 --> 00:06:42.130 align:middle line:90%
What were they like?

00:06:42.130 --> 00:06:44.320 align:middle line:90%
And were they teachers of sorts?

00:06:44.320 --> 00:06:47.410 align:middle line:84%
>>CORY: Yeah, so what
happened when I was five,

00:06:47.410 --> 00:06:49.330 align:middle line:90%
this group of beings showed up.

00:06:49.330 --> 00:06:51.010 align:middle line:90%
They were more of light beings.

00:06:51.010 --> 00:06:53.360 align:middle line:84%
They're not like ETs
or anything like that.

00:06:53.360 --> 00:06:56.470 align:middle line:84%
And what happened
was it felt that they

00:06:56.470 --> 00:06:58.220 align:middle line:90%
were part of my lineage.

00:06:58.220 --> 00:07:01.705 align:middle line:84%
It's almost like they
were me on the other side.

00:07:01.705 --> 00:07:04.480 align:middle line:84%
They're what I call
my spirit family.

00:07:04.480 --> 00:07:08.440 align:middle line:84%
And so what was really, really
amazing in that experience

00:07:08.440 --> 00:07:13.030 align:middle line:84%
is that I felt that I came
to this side of the veil

00:07:13.030 --> 00:07:15.070 align:middle line:90%
to continue the conversation.

00:07:15.070 --> 00:07:19.090 align:middle line:84%
It's almost like that
connection is never severed.

00:07:19.090 --> 00:07:22.450 align:middle line:84%
And I could see how we were
telepathically communicating.

00:07:22.450 --> 00:07:25.810 align:middle line:84%
They showed me, if you want
to maintain this connection,

00:07:25.810 --> 00:07:27.200 align:middle line:90%
you have to ask for it.

00:07:27.200 --> 00:07:28.000 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Oh.

00:07:28.000 --> 00:07:28.800 align:middle line:90%
And OK.

00:07:28.800 --> 00:07:31.000 align:middle line:84%
And we'll get to that
because that's a real key.

00:07:31.000 --> 00:07:31.450 align:middle line:90%
>>CORY: Yeah.

00:07:31.450 --> 00:07:33.283 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: A lot of times
people either don't

00:07:33.283 --> 00:07:36.010 align:middle line:84%
know they're supposed
to ask, or don't

00:07:36.010 --> 00:07:38.170 align:middle line:84%
think they're worthy
of asking, or don't

00:07:38.170 --> 00:07:40.540 align:middle line:84%
think that there will be help
on the way if they do ask.

00:07:40.540 --> 00:07:41.340 align:middle line:90%
>>CORY: Absolutely.

00:07:41.340 --> 00:07:43.330 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Humanity really
suffers from a lack

00:07:43.330 --> 00:07:46.960 align:middle line:90%
of self-confidence at large.

00:07:46.960 --> 00:07:48.940 align:middle line:84%
And we tend not to
ask for the help

00:07:48.940 --> 00:07:52.090 align:middle line:84%
that we need that
is very abundant

00:07:52.090 --> 00:07:54.620 align:middle line:90%
and would be abundantly given.

00:07:54.620 --> 00:07:55.420 align:middle line:90%
>>CORY: Absolutely.

00:07:55.420 --> 00:07:57.850 align:middle line:84%
And I mean when we
say asking, it's

00:07:57.850 --> 00:07:59.710 align:middle line:84%
almost like we
think we're asking

00:07:59.710 --> 00:08:01.160 align:middle line:90%
for permission or something.

00:08:01.160 --> 00:08:02.500 align:middle line:90%
But that's not what it is.

00:08:02.500 --> 00:08:03.830 align:middle line:90%
It's actually about intention.

00:08:03.830 --> 00:08:04.630 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:08:04.630 --> 00:08:06.190 align:middle line:84%
>>CORY: You know,
I see sometimes--

00:08:06.190 --> 00:08:07.840 align:middle line:84%
because I see the
subtle energy, I

00:08:07.840 --> 00:08:10.240 align:middle line:90%
see the beings around someone.

00:08:10.240 --> 00:08:13.510 align:middle line:90%
And the beings want to help.

00:08:13.510 --> 00:08:15.790 align:middle line:84%
But they're not going
to help unless you ask.

00:08:15.790 --> 00:08:18.370 align:middle line:84%
So it's like you have
to put your intention

00:08:18.370 --> 00:08:20.780 align:middle line:90%
and say, I want this help.

00:08:20.780 --> 00:08:25.180 align:middle line:84%
I want this
connection to be real.

00:08:25.180 --> 00:08:27.080 align:middle line:84%
And that's when
it really happens.

00:08:27.080 --> 00:08:30.040 align:middle line:84%
So that was a key
understanding for me,

00:08:30.040 --> 00:08:32.617 align:middle line:84%
because I realized
that the intention--

00:08:32.617 --> 00:08:34.159 align:middle line:84%
everything starts
with the intention.

00:08:34.159 --> 00:08:35.034 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Absolutely.

00:08:35.034 --> 00:08:37.299 align:middle line:84%
>>CORY: And so eventually
after doing all this work,

00:08:37.299 --> 00:08:39.159 align:middle line:84%
and teaching, and
facilitating, I

00:08:39.159 --> 00:08:41.590 align:middle line:90%
started working with scientists.

00:08:41.590 --> 00:08:46.150 align:middle line:84%
And of course, many people have
done experiences experiments

00:08:46.150 --> 00:08:49.280 align:middle line:84%
to demonstrate how the
mind effects matter.

00:08:49.280 --> 00:08:51.940 align:middle line:84%
And so I started working
with different scientists.

00:08:51.940 --> 00:08:54.310 align:middle line:84%
The first one was, for
example, Glen Rein.

00:08:54.310 --> 00:08:55.870 align:middle line:90%
We worked on water.

00:08:55.870 --> 00:08:59.980 align:middle line:84%
And we started to do
experiments to demonstrate how

00:08:59.980 --> 00:09:01.990 align:middle line:90%
focusing my intention on water.

00:09:01.990 --> 00:09:05.500 align:middle line:84%
If I could change the pH,
for example, or focusing

00:09:05.500 --> 00:09:09.850 align:middle line:84%
on a DNA sample, if we could
change the molecular structure.

00:09:09.850 --> 00:09:15.340 align:middle line:84%
And these experiments
started to be so incredible

00:09:15.340 --> 00:09:18.340 align:middle line:90%
that we kind of built on that.

00:09:18.340 --> 00:09:21.320 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And they're
validating, basically

00:09:21.320 --> 00:09:23.770 align:middle line:84%
using science to validate
what already exists.

00:09:23.770 --> 00:09:26.940 align:middle line:84%
>>CORY: Even when the
healing happens to you,

00:09:26.940 --> 00:09:28.690 align:middle line:84%
you kind of know it
happened, but you

00:09:28.690 --> 00:09:30.790 align:middle line:90%
don't know how it happens.

00:09:30.790 --> 00:09:34.090 align:middle line:84%
And so I think it helps
a lot to understand

00:09:34.090 --> 00:09:35.320 align:middle line:90%
the mechanics of it all.

00:09:35.320 --> 00:09:39.700 align:middle line:84%
It almost validates, confirms,
gives you the confidence

00:09:39.700 --> 00:09:41.525 align:middle line:90%
to create the next thing.

00:09:41.525 --> 00:09:42.400 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Absolutely.

00:09:42.400 --> 00:09:45.160 align:middle line:84%
So tell us about some
more of the experiments

00:09:45.160 --> 00:09:47.750 align:middle line:84%
that you ran with scientists
that were documented.

00:09:47.750 --> 00:09:48.550 align:middle line:90%
>>CORY: Yeah.

00:09:48.550 --> 00:09:50.860 align:middle line:10%
So in the film, for
example, I wanted

00:09:50.860 --> 00:09:53.680 align:middle line:10%
to do different
types of experiments

00:09:53.680 --> 00:09:56.740 align:middle line:10%
to basically show the same
thing-- that consciousness

00:09:56.740 --> 00:10:01.420 align:middle line:10%
is nonlocal and that it has
a physical, measurable effect

00:10:01.420 --> 00:10:03.170 align:middle line:10%
on the physical world.

00:10:03.170 --> 00:10:07.420 align:middle line:84%
So like I said, we did
one with water where--

00:10:07.420 --> 00:10:11.470 align:middle line:84%
of course, for those who
understand a scientific set up,

00:10:11.470 --> 00:10:14.150 align:middle line:84%
what we do is we
create a baseline.

00:10:14.150 --> 00:10:16.510 align:middle line:84%
Which means we take
measurements of the pH of water

00:10:16.510 --> 00:10:19.420 align:middle line:84%
over a period of time
over, and over, and over.

00:10:19.420 --> 00:10:23.680 align:middle line:84%
And then exactly at the time
where we focus our intention

00:10:23.680 --> 00:10:27.080 align:middle line:84%
and we ask for the
pH to go up or down,

00:10:27.080 --> 00:10:30.280 align:middle line:84%
it's exactly at that time where
we see this measurement go

00:10:30.280 --> 00:10:31.550 align:middle line:90%
up and down.

00:10:31.550 --> 00:10:34.660 align:middle line:84%
And then when you shift
your focus elsewhere,

00:10:34.660 --> 00:10:36.730 align:middle line:90%
it goes back to the baseline.

00:10:36.730 --> 00:10:39.160 align:middle line:84%
That's how we know
it was the intention.

00:10:39.160 --> 00:10:40.210 align:middle line:90%
It wasn't random.

00:10:40.210 --> 00:10:43.000 align:middle line:84%
And then of course, we have
to repeat it over and over.

00:10:43.000 --> 00:10:45.130 align:middle line:90%
So we did that on film.

00:10:45.130 --> 00:10:47.528 align:middle line:90%
Now don't forget we're filming.

00:10:47.528 --> 00:10:49.570 align:middle line:84%
So we have all these
cameras, all this equipment-

00:10:49.570 --> 00:10:51.678 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Which is
always very distracting.

00:10:51.678 --> 00:10:52.720 align:middle line:90%
>>CORY: Very distracting.

00:10:52.720 --> 00:10:53.750 align:middle line:90%
And the electromagnetic--

00:10:53.750 --> 00:10:54.190 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: All of it.

00:10:54.190 --> 00:10:55.780 align:middle line:84%
>>CORY: --and the
people waiting around.

00:10:55.780 --> 00:10:57.822 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And that's what's
really wonderful here

00:10:57.822 --> 00:10:58.930 align:middle line:90%
is that you captured it.

00:10:58.930 --> 00:11:00.790 align:middle line:84%
Because a lot of times
these things happen

00:11:00.790 --> 00:11:02.590 align:middle line:84%
and they're observed,
but they're not

00:11:02.590 --> 00:11:04.060 align:middle line:84%
captured because
people didn't go

00:11:04.060 --> 00:11:07.440 align:middle line:84%
through that extra process of
having a film crew involved,

00:11:07.440 --> 00:11:08.630 align:middle line:90%
which is a big hassle.

00:11:08.630 --> 00:11:09.680 align:middle line:90%
>>CORY: Exactly.

00:11:09.680 --> 00:11:14.310 align:middle line:84%
And so in fact what I had
to do before we started,

00:11:14.310 --> 00:11:17.060 align:middle line:84%
I'd had to kind
of calm everybody

00:11:17.060 --> 00:11:20.960 align:middle line:84%
and say, OK, now we need
to have-- we can't do it

00:11:20.960 --> 00:11:22.130 align:middle line:90%
for over three days.

00:11:22.130 --> 00:11:23.840 align:middle line:90%
This costs money, you guys.

00:11:23.840 --> 00:11:25.250 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:11:25.250 --> 00:11:27.140 align:middle line:84%
So you had to line
up the experiments.

00:11:27.140 --> 00:11:28.050 align:middle line:90%
>>CORY: Exactly.

00:11:28.050 --> 00:11:31.280 align:middle line:84%
So we would take some
time to really bring

00:11:31.280 --> 00:11:35.390 align:middle line:84%
everyone's focus on just raising
the vibration, letting go.

00:11:35.390 --> 00:11:39.920 align:middle line:84%
And then we would do this
experiment live on camera.

00:11:39.920 --> 00:11:41.810 align:middle line:84%
And then you see the
measurement literally--

00:11:41.810 --> 00:11:43.160 align:middle line:90%
I mean the camera picks it up.

00:11:43.160 --> 00:11:44.120 align:middle line:90%
You see the computer.

00:11:44.120 --> 00:11:46.580 align:middle line:84%
And then it starts
to drop again.

00:11:46.580 --> 00:11:49.260 align:middle line:90%
It's really amazing.

00:11:49.260 --> 00:11:50.420 align:middle line:90%
So we did that with water.

00:11:50.420 --> 00:11:52.070 align:middle line:90%
We did that with DNA.

00:11:52.070 --> 00:11:56.180 align:middle line:84%
We also did the
telekinesis, moving objects.

00:11:56.180 --> 00:12:00.590 align:middle line:84%
And so in the movie
we started out

00:12:00.590 --> 00:12:03.860 align:middle line:84%
with just being able to focus
on a piece of paper, trying

00:12:03.860 --> 00:12:05.300 align:middle line:90%
to get it to rotate.

00:12:05.300 --> 00:12:07.340 align:middle line:84%
So people would say,
yeah, it's the air

00:12:07.340 --> 00:12:08.420 align:middle line:90%
or it's the temperature.

00:12:08.420 --> 00:12:12.560 align:middle line:84%
Even when you put it under a
glass container with your hands

00:12:12.560 --> 00:12:16.220 align:middle line:84%
on it, people will say, oh, it's
the temperature that changes,

00:12:16.220 --> 00:12:18.020 align:middle line:84%
or the air molecules,
or whatever.

00:12:18.020 --> 00:12:20.060 align:middle line:84%
But then we took
it a step further

00:12:20.060 --> 00:12:23.580 align:middle line:84%
and then we did
it long distance.

00:12:23.580 --> 00:12:25.670 align:middle line:90%
So there is no temperature.

00:12:25.670 --> 00:12:27.800 align:middle line:90%
There is no electromagnetic.

00:12:27.800 --> 00:12:32.450 align:middle line:84%
And we had incredible effects
moving a physical object

00:12:32.450 --> 00:12:33.620 align:middle line:90%
at a distance.

00:12:33.620 --> 00:12:36.170 align:middle line:84%
And we also tried
it under a vacuum.

00:12:36.170 --> 00:12:41.510 align:middle line:84%
Now under a vacuum means there
is no air molecule, almost

00:12:41.510 --> 00:12:42.710 align:middle line:90%
none.

00:12:42.710 --> 00:12:44.450 align:middle line:90%
It was temperature controlled.

00:12:44.450 --> 00:12:48.420 align:middle line:84%
So because we went
to that extent,

00:12:48.420 --> 00:12:51.200 align:middle line:84%
it's almost like you have
to come out of it after you

00:12:51.200 --> 00:12:53.390 align:middle line:90%
watch it thinking this is real.

00:12:53.390 --> 00:12:55.140 align:middle line:84%
I mean, that's what
I'm hoping anyway.

00:12:55.140 --> 00:12:55.940 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:12:55.940 --> 00:12:58.580 align:middle line:84%
I mean you went the extra
distance to prove that.

00:12:58.580 --> 00:12:59.600 align:middle line:90%
>>CORY: Yes.

00:12:59.600 --> 00:13:02.420 align:middle line:84%
And what I love
about all this also

00:13:02.420 --> 00:13:05.527 align:middle line:84%
is that I didn't want to be
the only one who could do this.

00:13:05.527 --> 00:13:07.610 align:middle line:84%
Because of course, that's
what I do, what I teach.

00:13:07.610 --> 00:13:11.400 align:middle line:84%
But I wanted to show that
anybody could do this.

00:13:11.400 --> 00:13:15.980 align:middle line:84%
So I have different guests
that we would invite

00:13:15.980 --> 00:13:17.540 align:middle line:90%
for the different segments.

00:13:17.540 --> 00:13:21.020 align:middle line:84%
And we would tell them,
we would teach them.

00:13:21.020 --> 00:13:24.740 align:middle line:84%
This one person, one
guest, the actress

00:13:24.740 --> 00:13:28.380 align:middle line:84%
we had, she had never done
anything like this before.

00:13:28.380 --> 00:13:30.710 align:middle line:90%
So we had a guest teacher.

00:13:30.710 --> 00:13:34.550 align:middle line:84%
And he taught her how to do
telekinesis in two hours.

00:13:34.550 --> 00:13:37.820 align:middle line:84%
And the thing was
rotating like crazy.

00:13:37.820 --> 00:13:41.840 align:middle line:84%
And also we know
it's a real effect

00:13:41.840 --> 00:13:45.770 align:middle line:84%
because the object, the paper,
rotates in one direction.

00:13:45.770 --> 00:13:47.360 align:middle line:90%
It stops.

00:13:47.360 --> 00:13:49.100 align:middle line:84%
Then it turns in a
different direction.

00:13:49.100 --> 00:13:50.543 align:middle line:90%
It stops.

00:13:50.543 --> 00:13:51.710 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: That's not random.

00:13:51.710 --> 00:13:52.557 align:middle line:90%
>>CORY: That's not random.

00:13:52.557 --> 00:13:53.030 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:13:53.030 --> 00:13:53.990 align:middle line:90%
>>CORY: You could tell.

00:13:53.990 --> 00:13:58.590 align:middle line:84%
And what was so incredible on
that day when we were filming,

00:13:58.590 --> 00:14:00.180 align:middle line:84%
she didn't know
what she was doing.

00:14:00.180 --> 00:14:02.780 align:middle line:84%
She was just like,
I'm just going to try.

00:14:02.780 --> 00:14:06.050 align:middle line:84%
And so at one
point she said, I'm

00:14:06.050 --> 00:14:08.360 align:middle line:84%
just going to create
a personal connection

00:14:08.360 --> 00:14:09.840 align:middle line:90%
with this piece of paper.

00:14:09.840 --> 00:14:13.430 align:middle line:84%
So she started-- she was very
spontaneous, which was amazing.

00:14:13.430 --> 00:14:18.210 align:middle line:84%
She started with two pieces of
paper under a glass container.

00:14:18.210 --> 00:14:20.180 align:middle line:84%
And so she started
giving them names.

00:14:20.180 --> 00:14:23.060 align:middle line:84%
Like I think it was the
Harriet and Juliet or something

00:14:23.060 --> 00:14:24.380 align:middle line:90%
funny like that.

00:14:24.380 --> 00:14:30.050 align:middle line:84%
And what that did is created
a personal connection and kind

00:14:30.050 --> 00:14:33.550 align:middle line:84%
of no separation
between her conscious--

00:14:33.550 --> 00:14:35.930 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And it created an
entanglement with the object.

00:14:35.930 --> 00:14:37.250 align:middle line:90%
>>CORY: Exactly.

00:14:37.250 --> 00:14:40.330 align:middle line:84%
And exactly at that moment,
and then she kept talking to it

00:14:40.330 --> 00:14:42.330 align:middle line:84%
and said, you know, I
don't know what I'm doing,

00:14:42.330 --> 00:14:43.640 align:middle line:90%
but I'm just going to love you.

00:14:43.640 --> 00:14:45.440 align:middle line:90%
I just love you.

00:14:45.440 --> 00:14:48.440 align:middle line:84%
The minute she says
the word "love,"

00:14:48.440 --> 00:14:50.320 align:middle line:84%
that thing was
rotating like crazy.

00:14:50.320 --> 00:14:51.120 align:middle line:90%
And it had--

00:14:51.120 --> 00:14:52.130 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Interesting.

00:14:52.130 --> 00:14:55.203 align:middle line:84%
>>CORY: --and it had been
still the entire time.

00:14:55.203 --> 00:14:56.120 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Interesting.

00:14:56.120 --> 00:14:59.120 align:middle line:84%
So it was the feeling,
and excitement,

00:14:59.120 --> 00:15:02.780 align:middle line:84%
and motivation of love,
not her instructing

00:15:02.780 --> 00:15:04.670 align:middle line:90%
it to move a certain direction.

00:15:04.670 --> 00:15:05.630 align:middle line:90%
>>CORY: Exactly.

00:15:05.630 --> 00:15:07.190 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: That's beautiful.

00:15:07.190 --> 00:15:08.600 align:middle line:90%
>>CORY: Yeah, exactly.

00:15:08.600 --> 00:15:10.850 align:middle line:84%
So of course she had
to direct her intention

00:15:10.850 --> 00:15:13.190 align:middle line:84%
like she wanted the
piece of paper to move,

00:15:13.190 --> 00:15:14.900 align:middle line:90%
but it was her passion.

00:15:14.900 --> 00:15:17.780 align:middle line:84%
And also a little bit not
knowing what to do with--

00:15:17.780 --> 00:15:19.040 align:middle line:90%
like it was her first time.

00:15:19.040 --> 00:15:21.500 align:middle line:84%
And she said, I'm just
going to give this energy.

00:15:21.500 --> 00:15:22.730 align:middle line:90%
That did it.

00:15:22.730 --> 00:15:27.680 align:middle line:84%
And what's also beautiful,
when we were filming the crew

00:15:27.680 --> 00:15:29.060 align:middle line:90%
was witnessing.

00:15:29.060 --> 00:15:32.600 align:middle line:84%
And this girl who had never
done it before, and now she--

00:15:32.600 --> 00:15:35.870 align:middle line:84%
so after the
filming, we literally

00:15:35.870 --> 00:15:38.090 align:middle line:90%
had six cameras all around.

00:15:38.090 --> 00:15:41.310 align:middle line:84%
There's cables everywhere,
lighting, all kinds of things.

00:15:41.310 --> 00:15:47.000 align:middle line:84%
And the fact that she could
do it under those conditions,

00:15:47.000 --> 00:15:49.020 align:middle line:90%
the crew was blown away.

00:15:49.020 --> 00:15:52.650 align:middle line:84%
And in fact, they started
saying, wait, can I do it?

00:15:52.650 --> 00:15:53.540 align:middle line:90%
Can I try it?

00:15:53.540 --> 00:15:55.730 align:middle line:84%
And that's exactly the
result that I wanted.

00:15:55.730 --> 00:15:59.930 align:middle line:84%
I wanted people to look
at this as an example,

00:15:59.930 --> 00:16:04.130 align:middle line:84%
and be empowered, and say,
I just want to try it.

00:16:04.130 --> 00:16:08.610 align:middle line:84%
Maybe it's just a game, but
that gives you the confidence

00:16:08.610 --> 00:16:12.690 align:middle line:84%
that you are capable
of manifesting

00:16:12.690 --> 00:16:13.840 align:middle line:90%
something physically.

00:16:13.840 --> 00:16:14.640 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:16:14.640 --> 00:16:16.260 align:middle line:84%
>>CORY: It's no
longer in your head.

00:16:16.260 --> 00:16:17.340 align:middle line:90%
It's like you can see it.

00:16:17.340 --> 00:16:19.010 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Yeah, well,
that's wonderful.

00:16:19.010 --> 00:16:20.700 align:middle line:84%
Well on behalf of
everyone, thank you

00:16:20.700 --> 00:16:23.910 align:middle line:84%
for doing those experiments
and capturing them in the film.

00:16:23.910 --> 00:16:24.870 align:middle line:90%
I love that.

00:16:24.870 --> 00:16:28.440 align:middle line:84%
Also another thing you
talk about is being able--

00:16:28.440 --> 00:16:31.200 align:middle line:84%
this is just kind of moving
through some of the tests you

00:16:31.200 --> 00:16:34.680 align:middle line:84%
do and the methods
you use and so forth--

00:16:34.680 --> 00:16:37.160 align:middle line:84%
being able to see
while blindfolded.

00:16:37.160 --> 00:16:38.150 align:middle line:90%
>>CORY: Yes.

00:16:38.150 --> 00:16:38.977 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:16:38.977 --> 00:16:41.460 align:middle line:90%
So let's talk about that a bit.

00:16:41.460 --> 00:16:43.350 align:middle line:90%
>>CORY: That was insane.

00:16:43.350 --> 00:16:46.470 align:middle line:84%
So I found those
children in the UK,

00:16:46.470 --> 00:16:48.820 align:middle line:90%
I think about four years ago.

00:16:48.820 --> 00:16:49.840 align:middle line:90%
And I thought--

00:16:49.840 --> 00:16:50.940 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So it was
a group of children

00:16:50.940 --> 00:16:52.470 align:middle line:90%
that had been known to do this?

00:16:52.470 --> 00:16:53.733 align:middle line:90%
>>CORY: Yes, yes.

00:16:53.733 --> 00:16:56.150 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Was someone working
with them in the experiments

00:16:56.150 --> 00:16:56.850 align:middle line:90%
already?

00:16:56.850 --> 00:16:57.520 align:middle line:90%
>>CORY: Yes, yes.

00:16:57.520 --> 00:16:58.300 align:middle line:90%
It's not an experiment.

00:16:58.300 --> 00:16:59.100 align:middle line:90%
It was a school.

00:16:59.100 --> 00:17:00.640 align:middle line:84%
It was a lady that's
teaching them.

00:17:00.640 --> 00:17:01.440 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:17:01.440 --> 00:17:05.069 align:middle line:84%
>>CORY: So I thought,
if that is true,

00:17:05.069 --> 00:17:07.290 align:middle line:84%
this would be the
ultimate validation

00:17:07.290 --> 00:17:11.470 align:middle line:84%
that we can create
beyond our physical body.

00:17:11.470 --> 00:17:13.300 align:middle line:90%
And so I went to see them.

00:17:13.300 --> 00:17:18.030 align:middle line:84%
And so I literally, I
mean, worked with them.

00:17:18.030 --> 00:17:19.980 align:middle line:90%
And I tried it myself.

00:17:19.980 --> 00:17:23.520 align:middle line:84%
And I could see
there's nothing fake.

00:17:23.520 --> 00:17:24.900 align:middle line:90%
They weren't cheating.

00:17:24.900 --> 00:17:26.579 align:middle line:84%
The kind of things
that they were doing

00:17:26.579 --> 00:17:28.662 align:middle line:84%
is not just reading, because
people would say, oh,

00:17:28.662 --> 00:17:29.730 align:middle line:90%
they memorized the text.

00:17:29.730 --> 00:17:31.500 align:middle line:84%
People who are
skeptical are always

00:17:31.500 --> 00:17:33.090 align:middle line:90%
going to try to find something.

00:17:33.090 --> 00:17:34.740 align:middle line:90%
None of that is true.

00:17:34.740 --> 00:17:37.530 align:middle line:84%
Because I would take
a piece of paper

00:17:37.530 --> 00:17:40.590 align:middle line:84%
and I would write something
on it, so they had no idea.

00:17:40.590 --> 00:17:41.640 align:middle line:90%
I would pick up a card.

00:17:41.640 --> 00:17:43.860 align:middle line:84%
They didn't know
what card I was--

00:17:43.860 --> 00:17:47.040 align:middle line:90%
and they could see everything.

00:17:47.040 --> 00:17:48.963 align:middle line:90%
They would play ball outside.

00:17:48.963 --> 00:17:50.130 align:middle line:90%
I mean, all kinds of games--

00:17:50.130 --> 00:17:51.570 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Blindfolded?

00:17:51.570 --> 00:17:53.220 align:middle line:90%
>>CORY: Completely blindfolded.

00:17:53.220 --> 00:17:57.840 align:middle line:84%
So then I said, this is
really, really important

00:17:57.840 --> 00:17:59.660 align:middle line:90%
what we are tapping into here.

00:17:59.660 --> 00:18:01.230 align:middle line:90%
So I started to--

00:18:01.230 --> 00:18:04.110 align:middle line:84%
I said, wait, if we
can train ourselves

00:18:04.110 --> 00:18:09.670 align:middle line:84%
to see without our eyes, could
this be helping the blind?

00:18:09.670 --> 00:18:11.700 align:middle line:84%
And so I started to
investigate other groups

00:18:11.700 --> 00:18:13.320 align:middle line:90%
to see who was doing what.

00:18:13.320 --> 00:18:19.980 align:middle line:84%
And sure enough, I found a
group in Romania, Russia, Utah,

00:18:19.980 --> 00:18:21.420 align:middle line:90%
all kinds of places.

00:18:21.420 --> 00:18:25.500 align:middle line:84%
Now they all do
different techniques.

00:18:25.500 --> 00:18:28.990 align:middle line:84%
And also they think the
methodology works differently.

00:18:28.990 --> 00:18:31.540 align:middle line:84%
Some of them think it's
the pineal gland that's

00:18:31.540 --> 00:18:32.340 align:middle line:90%
doing something.

00:18:32.340 --> 00:18:36.280 align:middle line:84%
Other think it's a midbrain part
of the brain or what have you.

00:18:36.280 --> 00:18:40.890 align:middle line:84%
So I think they have their own
theory as to how it's working.

00:18:40.890 --> 00:18:45.460 align:middle line:84%
And the method is different,
but the result is the same.

00:18:45.460 --> 00:18:48.630 align:middle line:84%
So one of the groups,
the Russian group,

00:18:48.630 --> 00:18:55.720 align:middle line:84%
had even decided to, again,
validate it scientifically.

00:18:55.720 --> 00:18:59.260 align:middle line:84%
So they worked with
scientists in from Italy,

00:18:59.260 --> 00:19:01.720 align:middle line:84%
from the University
of Bari in Italy.

00:19:01.720 --> 00:19:04.440 align:middle line:84%
And what they had done
is they had somebody

00:19:04.440 --> 00:19:06.030 align:middle line:90%
completely blindfolded.

00:19:06.030 --> 00:19:10.350 align:middle line:84%
And they had a measuring
tool inside the mask

00:19:10.350 --> 00:19:14.370 align:middle line:84%
to see how much light was
actually inside the mask.

00:19:14.370 --> 00:19:16.950 align:middle line:84%
And they could
literally measure--

00:19:16.950 --> 00:19:20.610 align:middle line:84%
I mean it went down to pretty
much-- not pretty much-- to

00:19:20.610 --> 00:19:21.840 align:middle line:90%
actually zero.

00:19:21.840 --> 00:19:25.560 align:middle line:84%
Zero light photon
inside the mask,

00:19:25.560 --> 00:19:28.750 align:middle line:84%
meaning there was
no light whatsoever.

00:19:28.750 --> 00:19:32.040 align:middle line:84%
And the person would
be reading everything.

00:19:32.040 --> 00:19:34.140 align:middle line:84%
They could read
everything on a computer.

00:19:34.140 --> 00:19:36.060 align:middle line:84%
But what was also
interesting is they

00:19:36.060 --> 00:19:39.630 align:middle line:90%
did the EEG at the same time.

00:19:39.630 --> 00:19:41.460 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Oh, what did it show?

00:19:41.460 --> 00:19:45.420 align:middle line:84%
>>CORY: So it showed that it's
as if the brain was behaving,

00:19:45.420 --> 00:19:48.690 align:middle line:84%
the occipital brain,
part of the brain

00:19:48.690 --> 00:19:53.430 align:middle line:84%
was being activated and
functioning as if someone

00:19:53.430 --> 00:19:55.860 align:middle line:90%
was actually reading.

00:19:55.860 --> 00:20:01.710 align:middle line:84%
So how is it possible that
you can read perfectly

00:20:01.710 --> 00:20:04.470 align:middle line:90%
and yet your eyes have--

00:20:04.470 --> 00:20:07.560 align:middle line:84%
because we know the
way we see is the light

00:20:07.560 --> 00:20:08.983 align:middle line:90%
is reflected on an object.

00:20:08.983 --> 00:20:09.900 align:middle line:90%
And that's how we see.

00:20:09.900 --> 00:20:12.760 align:middle line:90%
We see because of light.

00:20:12.760 --> 00:20:13.650 align:middle line:90%
So with no light--

00:20:13.650 --> 00:20:15.330 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: But that's
with our physical eyes.

00:20:15.330 --> 00:20:15.990 align:middle line:90%
>>CORY: Exactly.

00:20:15.990 --> 00:20:16.790 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:20:16.790 --> 00:20:19.020 align:middle line:84%
And so if you have
the intention to see

00:20:19.020 --> 00:20:22.050 align:middle line:84%
and you're moving
in a quantum way,

00:20:22.050 --> 00:20:26.130 align:middle line:84%
then it's interesting that
the occipital was still

00:20:26.130 --> 00:20:30.080 align:middle line:84%
involved to interpret the data,
even though the eyes weren't

00:20:30.080 --> 00:20:30.880 align:middle line:90%
involved.

00:20:30.880 --> 00:20:33.120 align:middle line:84%
So you're traveling
to the source

00:20:33.120 --> 00:20:37.020 align:middle line:84%
to be able to read
quote "read" something

00:20:37.020 --> 00:20:38.490 align:middle line:90%
beyond your field of vision.

00:20:38.490 --> 00:20:41.453 align:middle line:84%
But it's still being processed
through the occipital.

00:20:41.453 --> 00:20:42.870 align:middle line:84%
>>CORY: Yeah, but
not necessarily.

00:20:42.870 --> 00:20:44.610 align:middle line:84%
I think we've done
other experiments

00:20:44.610 --> 00:20:46.005 align:middle line:90%
where it wasn't the case.

00:20:46.005 --> 00:20:46.805 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Oh, OK.

00:20:46.805 --> 00:20:49.430 align:middle line:84%
So that's what I was wondering,
because that I find interesting

00:20:49.430 --> 00:20:51.660 align:middle line:84%
why that would even
engage or be necessary.

00:20:51.660 --> 00:20:53.400 align:middle line:90%
>>CORY: Yeah.

00:20:53.400 --> 00:20:56.700 align:middle line:84%
But my point is, though,
the brain was active

00:20:56.700 --> 00:20:58.695 align:middle line:84%
as if you were
consciously reading.

00:20:58.695 --> 00:20:59.820 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah, yeah, yeah.

00:20:59.820 --> 00:21:00.450 align:middle line:90%
>>CORY: Yeah.

00:21:00.450 --> 00:21:01.350 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Fascinating.

00:21:01.350 --> 00:21:02.150 align:middle line:90%
>>CORY: Yeah.

00:21:02.150 --> 00:21:06.240 align:middle line:84%
And I think in the movie
you can see the pupils also

00:21:06.240 --> 00:21:09.800 align:middle line:84%
were very dilated, meaning
there was no light.

00:21:09.800 --> 00:21:12.900 align:middle line:84%
So the eyes were dilated
and yet the brain

00:21:12.900 --> 00:21:15.630 align:middle line:84%
was behaving as if
there was light.

00:21:15.630 --> 00:21:21.480 align:middle line:84%
So I think that's what
the results meant.

00:21:21.480 --> 00:21:23.850 align:middle line:90%
So I thought this was--

00:21:23.850 --> 00:21:25.478 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: That is fascinating.

00:21:25.478 --> 00:21:28.020 align:middle line:84%
I mean I'm just rolling it over
in my mind thinking about it,

00:21:28.020 --> 00:21:29.700 align:middle line:84%
and feeling it
more than anything.

00:21:29.700 --> 00:21:32.250 align:middle line:84%
When we're reading, it's
a very specific kind

00:21:32.250 --> 00:21:34.830 align:middle line:84%
of engagement, digital
engagement, with the brain.

00:21:34.830 --> 00:21:36.870 align:middle line:90%
It's not a holistic experience.

00:21:36.870 --> 00:21:37.680 align:middle line:90%
It's digital.

00:21:37.680 --> 00:21:38.670 align:middle line:90%
>>CORY: Yes.

00:21:38.670 --> 00:21:42.510 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Reading black
symbols on white paper.

00:21:42.510 --> 00:21:45.330 align:middle line:84%
And so the engagement
with the brain,

00:21:45.330 --> 00:21:48.300 align:middle line:84%
maybe it does stimulate
kind of that same area

00:21:48.300 --> 00:21:51.400 align:middle line:84%
because of the nature of having
to interpret digital data.

00:21:51.400 --> 00:21:52.200 align:middle line:90%
>>CORY: Exactly.

00:21:52.200 --> 00:21:53.705 align:middle line:84%
Because you're reading, but
you're also interpreting.

00:21:53.705 --> 00:21:54.520 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: You're
interpreting it.

00:21:54.520 --> 00:21:55.942 align:middle line:90%
>>CORY: Yeah, exactly, exactly.

00:21:55.942 --> 00:21:57.150 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: That's fascinating.

00:21:57.150 --> 00:21:58.230 align:middle line:90%
>>CORY: So fascinating.

00:21:58.230 --> 00:21:59.030 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: OK.

00:21:59.030 --> 00:22:01.920 align:middle line:84%
So let's go back toward the
beginning of the conversation

00:22:01.920 --> 00:22:03.940 align:middle line:90%
when you were talking about pH.

00:22:03.940 --> 00:22:06.150 align:middle line:84%
And I started
thinking, well, then

00:22:06.150 --> 00:22:10.350 align:middle line:84%
if we can talk to pH in a
flask, a laboratory flask,

00:22:10.350 --> 00:22:13.920 align:middle line:84%
we can talk to the levels in
the fluids in our own body.

00:22:13.920 --> 00:22:16.560 align:middle line:84%
And for example, a lot of
inflammation, a lot of illness

00:22:16.560 --> 00:22:19.380 align:middle line:84%
comes from having, for
example, too acidic,

00:22:19.380 --> 00:22:21.960 align:middle line:90%
oftentimes too acidic, a system.

00:22:21.960 --> 00:22:25.740 align:middle line:84%
And the blood only operates in
a small spectrum of variance.

00:22:25.740 --> 00:22:28.110 align:middle line:84%
But if it is often
too acidic, you

00:22:28.110 --> 00:22:30.090 align:middle line:84%
can have a lot of
chronic illness.

00:22:30.090 --> 00:22:32.550 align:middle line:84%
And cancers can
develop and all that.

00:22:32.550 --> 00:22:36.870 align:middle line:84%
Can we, then, use the notion
of working with our minds

00:22:36.870 --> 00:22:39.810 align:middle line:90%
to direct our own physical pH?

00:22:39.810 --> 00:22:41.370 align:middle line:84%
>>CORY: Well that's
the reason why

00:22:41.370 --> 00:22:44.250 align:middle line:84%
I picked this specific
experiment to put it

00:22:44.250 --> 00:22:47.430 align:middle line:84%
in the film because
of our understanding

00:22:47.430 --> 00:22:51.240 align:middle line:84%
that the pH has a lot to
do with physical illness.

00:22:51.240 --> 00:22:56.040 align:middle line:84%
And rebalancing this
chemistry in the body

00:22:56.040 --> 00:22:57.840 align:middle line:90%
has a lot to do with healing.

00:22:57.840 --> 00:23:00.360 align:middle line:84%
And so that's
exactly what you said

00:23:00.360 --> 00:23:03.870 align:middle line:84%
is if we are able to
do it in a glass that's

00:23:03.870 --> 00:23:07.590 align:middle line:84%
outside of our-- we are
what 70%, 80%, who knows?

00:23:07.590 --> 00:23:08.610 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Water.

00:23:08.610 --> 00:23:09.430 align:middle line:90%
>>CORY: Water.

00:23:09.430 --> 00:23:11.693 align:middle line:10%
So if we do it on
a glass of water,

00:23:11.693 --> 00:23:13.110 align:middle line:10%
why couldn't we
do it on our body?

00:23:13.110 --> 00:23:14.650 align:middle line:10%
That's precisely the reason.

00:23:14.650 --> 00:23:17.700 align:middle line:10%
And in fact, I tried
doing that myself.

00:23:17.700 --> 00:23:20.760 align:middle line:84%
And I encourage people--
we don't think that way.

00:23:20.760 --> 00:23:22.530 align:middle line:90%
We are not trained that way.

00:23:22.530 --> 00:23:23.790 align:middle line:90%
That's not our reflex.

00:23:23.790 --> 00:23:28.230 align:middle line:84%
When we have a stomachache,
we go out and maybe drink

00:23:28.230 --> 00:23:30.960 align:middle line:84%
a bottle of 9 plus
pH or something we

00:23:30.960 --> 00:23:33.720 align:middle line:84%
bought at the store
at like $10, you know?

00:23:33.720 --> 00:23:36.060 align:middle line:84%
But I'm hoping that
people will start

00:23:36.060 --> 00:23:40.200 align:middle line:84%
to kind of gravitate towards
a spontaneous reaction

00:23:40.200 --> 00:23:42.300 align:middle line:90%
with, wait, let me just try it.

00:23:42.300 --> 00:23:45.150 align:middle line:84%
If it doesn't work,
nothing's going to happen.

00:23:45.150 --> 00:23:48.000 align:middle line:90%
Don't forget your mind is free.

00:23:48.000 --> 00:23:51.460 align:middle line:84%
So all you have to do is
just try, give it a try.

00:23:51.460 --> 00:23:54.420 align:middle line:84%
And so sometimes I would
focus on my stomach.

00:23:54.420 --> 00:23:56.610 align:middle line:84%
And I would say,
I'm not really sure

00:23:56.610 --> 00:23:58.980 align:middle line:84%
if it needs to go up or down--
because some people will,

00:23:58.980 --> 00:24:00.710 align:middle line:90%
wait, like how do I know?

00:24:00.710 --> 00:24:03.300 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: But the body has its
own intelligence and knowing.

00:24:03.300 --> 00:24:04.200 align:middle line:90%
>>CORY: Exactly.

00:24:04.200 --> 00:24:08.880 align:middle line:84%
So if you don't know, just tell
it, just tell it, I'm not sure,

00:24:08.880 --> 00:24:11.100 align:middle line:84%
but I'm working on the
pH and I want you--

00:24:11.100 --> 00:24:12.960 align:middle line:90%
and you'd be amazed--

00:24:12.960 --> 00:24:14.460 align:middle line:90%
I'm sure you know--

00:24:14.460 --> 00:24:19.890 align:middle line:84%
how quickly the body
responds if you just allow

00:24:19.890 --> 00:24:20.790 align:middle line:90%
it and you trust.

00:24:20.790 --> 00:24:24.240 align:middle line:84%
And you just set your intention
that is what you want.

00:24:24.240 --> 00:24:26.130 align:middle line:84%
And you do it over,
and over, and over.

00:24:26.130 --> 00:24:29.220 align:middle line:84%
And before you know
it, you kind of

00:24:29.220 --> 00:24:31.950 align:middle line:84%
take control of what's
happening in your body.

00:24:31.950 --> 00:24:36.775 align:middle line:84%
And I really hope that
people will start doing that.

00:24:36.775 --> 00:24:38.400 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: I think
it's really important

00:24:38.400 --> 00:24:42.000 align:middle line:84%
to have that tool in our toolbox
for ourselves and each other.

00:24:42.000 --> 00:24:43.560 align:middle line:90%
These are some notes I had here.

00:24:43.560 --> 00:24:45.870 align:middle line:84%
Let's talk about
the influences that

00:24:45.870 --> 00:24:55.190 align:middle line:84%
happen outside of our own
creation, such as 5G, chem

00:24:55.190 --> 00:24:57.270 align:middle line:84%
trails, big one
now in these years

00:24:57.270 --> 00:25:01.490 align:middle line:84%
is vaccines, digital signals
which are carrying information.

00:25:01.490 --> 00:25:03.990 align:middle line:84%
And this is something I really
have spent a little more time

00:25:03.990 --> 00:25:04.990 align:middle line:90%
thinking about recently.

00:25:04.990 --> 00:25:07.610 align:middle line:84%
Let's just start there because
I've been thinking about it

00:25:07.610 --> 00:25:09.970 align:middle line:90%
and that is digital signals.

00:25:09.970 --> 00:25:13.740 align:middle line:84%
So we have digital signals
carrying data and information.

00:25:13.740 --> 00:25:16.050 align:middle line:84%
But what they don't
ever talk about

00:25:16.050 --> 00:25:20.260 align:middle line:84%
is the quality of the
information that it's carrying,

00:25:20.260 --> 00:25:23.340 align:middle line:90%
which is generally quite low.

00:25:23.340 --> 00:25:26.760 align:middle line:84%
The quality of the
millions of conversations

00:25:26.760 --> 00:25:29.910 align:middle line:84%
happening digitally at one time,
everything passing through us.

00:25:29.910 --> 00:25:30.720 align:middle line:90%
We know that.

00:25:30.720 --> 00:25:32.290 align:middle line:84%
We know these signals
are everywhere.

00:25:32.290 --> 00:25:33.280 align:middle line:90%
They're ubiquitous.

00:25:33.280 --> 00:25:34.530 align:middle line:90%
They're passing through us.

00:25:34.530 --> 00:25:38.130 align:middle line:84%
But the quality of the
thoughts, and the words,

00:25:38.130 --> 00:25:42.180 align:middle line:84%
and the content that
comprises these conversations

00:25:42.180 --> 00:25:45.650 align:middle line:90%
is not usually sublime.

00:25:45.650 --> 00:25:48.080 align:middle line:84%
So we're getting
the signal itself,

00:25:48.080 --> 00:25:54.170 align:middle line:84%
but we're getting low
energy information passing

00:25:54.170 --> 00:25:56.390 align:middle line:84%
on that field
through us as well.

00:25:56.390 --> 00:25:59.030 align:middle line:84%
And I'd just love to have
some of your thoughts on that.

00:25:59.030 --> 00:26:02.160 align:middle line:84%
>>CORY: Yes, sometimes
it is so overwhelming.

00:26:02.160 --> 00:26:05.060 align:middle line:84%
I know when I'm in
Los Angeles I feel

00:26:05.060 --> 00:26:09.090 align:middle line:84%
I am being bombarded
with frequencies from all

00:26:09.090 --> 00:26:09.890 align:middle line:90%
over the place.

00:26:09.890 --> 00:26:11.220 align:middle line:90%
It is so chaotic.

00:26:11.220 --> 00:26:17.970 align:middle line:84%
So it's happening 100% all the
time and at times even more.

00:26:17.970 --> 00:26:19.990 align:middle line:84%
And I feel like
somebody is amping up

00:26:19.990 --> 00:26:23.240 align:middle line:84%
the signals or something,
because some days it's

00:26:23.240 --> 00:26:24.180 align:middle line:90%
really, really bad.

00:26:24.180 --> 00:26:24.980 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:26:24.980 --> 00:26:26.720 align:middle line:90%
>>CORY: And so because of that--

00:26:26.720 --> 00:26:30.780 align:middle line:84%
and also even, again, when you
become sensitive, as you know,

00:26:30.780 --> 00:26:32.210 align:middle line:90%
you feel them.

00:26:32.210 --> 00:26:35.990 align:middle line:84%
And so you know you can
protect yourself and do

00:26:35.990 --> 00:26:40.200 align:middle line:84%
all kinds of create a protective
shield and things like that.

00:26:40.200 --> 00:26:43.010 align:middle line:84%
But the idea, I think is, I
wonder if you're asking more

00:26:43.010 --> 00:26:44.790 align:middle line:90%
about discernment--

00:26:44.790 --> 00:26:45.590 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: No.

00:26:45.590 --> 00:26:48.050 align:middle line:84%
I'm just saying I think
we need to be aware,

00:26:48.050 --> 00:26:51.320 align:middle line:84%
because we're part of the
creation of that content.

00:26:51.320 --> 00:26:54.135 align:middle line:84%
And just simply to have an
awareness that the things

00:26:54.135 --> 00:26:55.760 align:middle line:84%
we're saying to one
another, that we're

00:26:55.760 --> 00:26:57.830 align:middle line:84%
projecting through media,
through our writing,

00:26:57.830 --> 00:27:01.670 align:middle line:84%
through our thought forms
that turn digital is affecting

00:27:01.670 --> 00:27:03.510 align:middle line:90%
us and everybody else as well.

00:27:03.510 --> 00:27:05.210 align:middle line:90%
We are connected this way.

00:27:05.210 --> 00:27:06.460 align:middle line:90%
>>CORY: Yes, absolutely.

00:27:06.460 --> 00:27:09.110 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And we're not
looking for the most

00:27:09.110 --> 00:27:12.740 align:middle line:84%
part of what's being exchanged
through these signals as

00:27:12.740 --> 00:27:13.550 align:middle line:90%
enlightened.

00:27:13.550 --> 00:27:16.160 align:middle line:84%
For the most part, it's
not enlightened thought

00:27:16.160 --> 00:27:17.910 align:middle line:90%
or dialogue.

00:27:17.910 --> 00:27:21.080 align:middle line:84%
It's not even
necessarily no one even

00:27:21.080 --> 00:27:22.850 align:middle line:84%
thinks in terms of
anyone else being

00:27:22.850 --> 00:27:24.680 align:middle line:90%
affected or even themselves.

00:27:24.680 --> 00:27:29.450 align:middle line:84%
It's not necessarily
generous or kind even,

00:27:29.450 --> 00:27:32.450 align:middle line:84%
it's just kind of
raw data, a lot of it

00:27:32.450 --> 00:27:36.060 align:middle line:84%
just functional by nature, which
is fine you have to have that.

00:27:36.060 --> 00:27:37.700 align:middle line:84%
But I think what
I'm trying to say

00:27:37.700 --> 00:27:40.760 align:middle line:84%
is what we're putting from
our heads out of our mouths

00:27:40.760 --> 00:27:44.240 align:middle line:84%
and fingertips are
affecting us on levels

00:27:44.240 --> 00:27:47.660 align:middle line:84%
that we're not understanding
being carried by technology.

00:27:47.660 --> 00:27:48.960 align:middle line:90%
>>CORY: I totally agree.

00:27:48.960 --> 00:27:51.903 align:middle line:84%
And I think it's gotten a
lot worse in the last year.

00:27:51.903 --> 00:27:54.320 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Yes, because people
have been more chaotic, more

00:27:54.320 --> 00:27:55.790 align:middle line:90%
angry, more divided.

00:27:55.790 --> 00:27:57.630 align:middle line:84%
And we have a
continued increase,

00:27:57.630 --> 00:28:00.590 align:middle line:84%
including installation of 5G,
which you can get on to here.

00:28:00.590 --> 00:28:02.330 align:middle line:84%
>>CORY: We are being
bombarded with all

00:28:02.330 --> 00:28:04.670 align:middle line:90%
these electromagnetic signals.

00:28:04.670 --> 00:28:07.970 align:middle line:84%
But I think the idea
is to become aware.

00:28:07.970 --> 00:28:11.270 align:middle line:84%
Because what happens is that
most people are not aware,

00:28:11.270 --> 00:28:13.820 align:middle line:90%
so they feel this--

00:28:13.820 --> 00:28:16.610 align:middle line:84%
I want to call it attack,
honestly, because sometimes I

00:28:16.610 --> 00:28:19.143 align:middle line:84%
literally feel I'm being
attacked or bombarded

00:28:19.143 --> 00:28:20.060 align:middle line:90%
with this information.

00:28:20.060 --> 00:28:21.220 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Well,
you're so sensitive.

00:28:21.220 --> 00:28:21.950 align:middle line:90%
And we are.

00:28:21.950 --> 00:28:22.750 align:middle line:90%
>>CORY: Yeah.

00:28:22.750 --> 00:28:25.620 align:middle line:84%
And so but the problem
is most people are not.

00:28:25.620 --> 00:28:29.600 align:middle line:84%
And so the danger with
that is they feel bad

00:28:29.600 --> 00:28:31.560 align:middle line:90%
but they don't know why.

00:28:31.560 --> 00:28:34.670 align:middle line:84%
And so the first,
the reaction is,

00:28:34.670 --> 00:28:37.560 align:middle line:84%
the reflex is, oh,
I don't feel good.

00:28:37.560 --> 00:28:38.630 align:middle line:90%
What's wrong with me?

00:28:38.630 --> 00:28:40.340 align:middle line:84%
How come I'm so anxious
all of a sudden?

00:28:40.340 --> 00:28:41.270 align:middle line:90%
I'm so confused.

00:28:41.270 --> 00:28:43.700 align:middle line:90%
And so they think it's them.

00:28:43.700 --> 00:28:46.730 align:middle line:84%
And so that adds, I
think, to the problem

00:28:46.730 --> 00:28:49.580 align:middle line:84%
because then you're
worried about--

00:28:49.580 --> 00:28:52.147 align:middle line:84%
you're the problem or
you have a problem.

00:28:52.147 --> 00:28:54.230 align:middle line:84%
And so I think going back
to what you're saying is

00:28:54.230 --> 00:28:56.020 align:middle line:90%
so important, the discernment.

00:28:56.020 --> 00:28:56.820 align:middle line:90%
Is it me?

00:28:56.820 --> 00:28:57.695 align:middle line:90%
Is it the collective?

00:28:57.695 --> 00:28:59.030 align:middle line:90%
Is it both?

00:28:59.030 --> 00:29:02.810 align:middle line:84%
Because if you can discern
that, wait, I woke up.

00:29:02.810 --> 00:29:03.760 align:middle line:90%
I was totally fine.

00:29:03.760 --> 00:29:05.870 align:middle line:84%
All of a sudden, I
have this anxiety

00:29:05.870 --> 00:29:07.430 align:middle line:90%
and all this thing happening.

00:29:07.430 --> 00:29:10.400 align:middle line:84%
If I can discern that
it is the collective,

00:29:10.400 --> 00:29:14.780 align:middle line:84%
then I can quickly shift my
perception and my perspective,

00:29:14.780 --> 00:29:19.250 align:middle line:84%
create a shield, and
begin to offset as opposed

00:29:19.250 --> 00:29:21.602 align:middle line:90%
to adding to that problem.

00:29:21.602 --> 00:29:23.060 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So this
is the shielding.

00:29:23.060 --> 00:29:24.710 align:middle line:84%
That's where shielding
does come in.

00:29:24.710 --> 00:29:25.510 align:middle line:90%
>>CORY: Yeah.

00:29:25.510 --> 00:29:29.060 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So tell us about
your preferred shielding.

00:29:29.060 --> 00:29:30.710 align:middle line:90%
Everybody has their own version.

00:29:30.710 --> 00:29:31.700 align:middle line:90%
Tell us yours.

00:29:31.700 --> 00:29:34.580 align:middle line:84%
>>CORY: Well basically,
especially nowadays,

00:29:34.580 --> 00:29:37.940 align:middle line:84%
when I wake up in the
morning, the first thing I do

00:29:37.940 --> 00:29:40.490 align:middle line:84%
is I just create a
bubble around me.

00:29:40.490 --> 00:29:43.070 align:middle line:84%
And I just call
it source energy.

00:29:43.070 --> 00:29:46.580 align:middle line:84%
That is actually the
energy of the beings that

00:29:46.580 --> 00:29:48.320 align:middle line:90%
came to me when I was five.

00:29:48.320 --> 00:29:52.610 align:middle line:84%
And so that signature,
going back to it

00:29:52.610 --> 00:29:55.730 align:middle line:84%
and being so familiar
with it my whole life,

00:29:55.730 --> 00:29:59.430 align:middle line:84%
I kind of can grab
it right there.

00:29:59.430 --> 00:30:03.450 align:middle line:84%
So I bring it all around
my being in my body.

00:30:03.450 --> 00:30:07.700 align:middle line:84%
And I say, I ask for protection
and safety throughout my day.

00:30:07.700 --> 00:30:11.450 align:middle line:84%
And I ask to remain in this
shield no matter where I go,

00:30:11.450 --> 00:30:12.320 align:middle line:90%
what I do.

00:30:12.320 --> 00:30:13.983 align:middle line:90%
And I visualize myself.

00:30:13.983 --> 00:30:15.650 align:middle line:84%
And if I have to go
somewhere, let's say

00:30:15.650 --> 00:30:21.470 align:middle line:84%
I have to go on a trip, I
keep this visual, this bubble

00:30:21.470 --> 00:30:24.500 align:middle line:84%
around me, and then
I literally visualize

00:30:24.500 --> 00:30:30.290 align:middle line:84%
myself going through
the entire trip

00:30:30.290 --> 00:30:35.300 align:middle line:84%
and getting to my destination
with this shield on.

00:30:35.300 --> 00:30:40.850 align:middle line:84%
And you'd be surprised,
sometimes in between there's

00:30:40.850 --> 00:30:43.710 align:middle line:84%
a point where it's
harder to keep.

00:30:43.710 --> 00:30:45.820 align:middle line:84%
So I know at that
point there's going

00:30:45.820 --> 00:30:47.470 align:middle line:90%
to be some more interference.

00:30:47.470 --> 00:30:50.620 align:middle line:84%
So I ask for additional or
I ask for an alternative.

00:30:50.620 --> 00:30:54.320 align:middle line:84%
Well maybe I don't go at
3:00 to that appointment

00:30:54.320 --> 00:30:56.450 align:middle line:84%
or I change it or
something like that.

00:30:56.450 --> 00:30:58.433 align:middle line:84%
So it's I find it
very, very useful.

00:30:58.433 --> 00:30:59.350 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: That's good.

00:30:59.350 --> 00:31:01.030 align:middle line:84%
Well, and you're
a diligent person.

00:31:01.030 --> 00:31:02.810 align:middle line:90%
You're a disciplined person.

00:31:02.810 --> 00:31:05.230 align:middle line:84%
I mean you have taken
the time to really

00:31:05.230 --> 00:31:09.290 align:middle line:84%
put protocols together, a
whole course of study together.

00:31:09.290 --> 00:31:13.000 align:middle line:84%
On the other hand, I am
so unconscious and lazy

00:31:13.000 --> 00:31:15.160 align:middle line:84%
in so many ways
about this stuff.

00:31:15.160 --> 00:31:20.920 align:middle line:84%
And I think it's because
I have always kind of just

00:31:20.920 --> 00:31:25.840 align:middle line:84%
felt that I'm so
well taken care of.

00:31:25.840 --> 00:31:29.830 align:middle line:84%
My soul family, my guides,
they know how I think,

00:31:29.830 --> 00:31:31.720 align:middle line:90%
that I'm beyond spontaneous.

00:31:31.720 --> 00:31:34.063 align:middle line:90%
It's like here, oh, shiny thing.

00:31:34.063 --> 00:31:35.230 align:middle line:90%
Oh, the laser's going there.

00:31:35.230 --> 00:31:35.700 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:31:35.700 --> 00:31:36.880 align:middle line:90%
I'll study that for a while.

00:31:36.880 --> 00:31:37.810 align:middle line:90%
I'll do this today.

00:31:37.810 --> 00:31:40.322 align:middle line:84%
And I don't have
habits, which is

00:31:40.322 --> 00:31:41.530 align:middle line:90%
a good thing and a bad thing.

00:31:41.530 --> 00:31:42.820 align:middle line:90%
I'm not habitual.

00:31:42.820 --> 00:31:45.530 align:middle line:84%
So I feel like in
my-- and just in case

00:31:45.530 --> 00:31:47.770 align:middle line:84%
there are other people
like me out out there,

00:31:47.770 --> 00:31:50.020 align:middle line:84%
that might beings
that look after me

00:31:50.020 --> 00:31:52.600 align:middle line:84%
and help me upon
request and such

00:31:52.600 --> 00:31:55.990 align:middle line:84%
are really good at just
kind of like throwing

00:31:55.990 --> 00:31:59.300 align:middle line:84%
that protection up around me
in spite of me all the time.

00:31:59.300 --> 00:32:02.560 align:middle line:84%
I just trip through things
and feel like in life I'm

00:32:02.560 --> 00:32:06.020 align:middle line:84%
missing potholes all the
time and don't even know it.

00:32:06.020 --> 00:32:06.880 align:middle line:90%
>>CORY: Yeah.

00:32:06.880 --> 00:32:09.255 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And that can happen
because our guides are just

00:32:09.255 --> 00:32:10.630 align:middle line:90%
amazing beings.

00:32:10.630 --> 00:32:14.770 align:middle line:84%
And they look at the
caliber of our willingness

00:32:14.770 --> 00:32:17.350 align:middle line:84%
to engage our levels of
knowledge or discipline,

00:32:17.350 --> 00:32:19.540 align:middle line:84%
and they help us
adjust accordingly.

00:32:19.540 --> 00:32:22.090 align:middle line:84%
They help adjust
for us accordingly.

00:32:22.090 --> 00:32:24.070 align:middle line:84%
>>CORY: Like you
said, many people

00:32:24.070 --> 00:32:25.450 align:middle line:90%
don't have that discipline.

00:32:25.450 --> 00:32:27.772 align:middle line:84%
But I still think-- and
even though you know--

00:32:27.772 --> 00:32:29.230 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: I think
it's great to do.

00:32:29.230 --> 00:32:30.773 align:middle line:90%
I do it on occasion, by the way.

00:32:30.773 --> 00:32:32.690 align:middle line:84%
I do do it if it's
something really important.

00:32:32.690 --> 00:32:35.357 align:middle line:84%
The rest of the time I just kind
of la-dee-dah, go through life.

00:32:35.357 --> 00:32:36.220 align:middle line:90%
No, it's good.

00:32:36.220 --> 00:32:38.727 align:middle line:84%
>>CORY: And you know your
guides are taking care of you.

00:32:38.727 --> 00:32:39.935 align:middle line:90%
You're know you're protected.

00:32:39.935 --> 00:32:42.490 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: I have a very
close relationship.

00:32:42.490 --> 00:32:44.470 align:middle line:84%
>>CORY: But I still
feel it's important.

00:32:44.470 --> 00:32:46.600 align:middle line:84%
You don't have to make
it so complicated,

00:32:46.600 --> 00:32:48.020 align:middle line:90%
sit and meditate for an hour.

00:32:48.020 --> 00:32:50.020 align:middle line:84%
That's the reason why
before I get out of bed--

00:32:50.020 --> 00:32:51.280 align:middle line:84%
I mean, it's literally
like five minutes.

00:32:51.280 --> 00:32:52.030 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Just throw
up your bubble.

00:32:52.030 --> 00:32:53.240 align:middle line:90%
Like putting your clothes on.

00:32:53.240 --> 00:32:54.040 align:middle line:90%
>>CORY: Exactly.

00:32:54.040 --> 00:32:55.870 align:middle line:84%
It's like a five
minute thing, you know?

00:32:55.870 --> 00:32:58.810 align:middle line:84%
And just by visualizing
and thinking it and saying

00:32:58.810 --> 00:33:01.320 align:middle line:84%
this my intention
for the day so I

00:33:01.320 --> 00:33:03.190 align:middle line:84%
don't have to
constantly do that.

00:33:03.190 --> 00:33:06.370 align:middle line:84%
And then before I
go to sleep, that's

00:33:06.370 --> 00:33:10.690 align:middle line:84%
another very important thing
is I do the same thing.

00:33:10.690 --> 00:33:13.150 align:middle line:84%
Before going to sleep,
I put the bubble.

00:33:13.150 --> 00:33:17.790 align:middle line:84%
And if you've been to Costco
or Best Buy or something,

00:33:17.790 --> 00:33:22.090 align:middle line:84%
I'm sure you picked up a
few beings or something

00:33:22.090 --> 00:33:23.440 align:middle line:90%
that latched onto you.

00:33:23.440 --> 00:33:25.900 align:middle line:84%
So same thing, I call
that energetic hygiene.

00:33:25.900 --> 00:33:28.100 align:middle line:84%
So you just flush it
out of your system.

00:33:28.100 --> 00:33:30.490 align:middle line:84%
If you're not sure, again,
if you can't discern,

00:33:30.490 --> 00:33:33.610 align:middle line:84%
just say whatever I picked
up without me even knowing,

00:33:33.610 --> 00:33:37.150 align:middle line:84%
I'm flushing it out of my
energy field of my body.

00:33:37.150 --> 00:33:39.470 align:middle line:84%
Put yourself in this bubble
and stay in the bubble

00:33:39.470 --> 00:33:40.270 align:middle line:90%
through the night.

00:33:40.270 --> 00:33:45.280 align:middle line:84%
Because at night is also where
I see a lot of stuff happen.

00:33:45.280 --> 00:33:49.550 align:middle line:84%
You go out of body and
a lot of interfering--

00:33:49.550 --> 00:33:51.640 align:middle line:90%
speaking of digital signals--

00:33:51.640 --> 00:33:55.030 align:middle line:84%
messing with your dreams,
messing with your brain.

00:33:55.030 --> 00:33:57.640 align:middle line:84%
I don't know if you
noticed, but recently--

00:33:57.640 --> 00:34:00.670 align:middle line:84%
I've never had a
sleeping problem.

00:34:00.670 --> 00:34:05.140 align:middle line:84%
Now every person I know has
some sort of sleeping problem.

00:34:05.140 --> 00:34:06.430 align:middle line:90%
And you can't go to sleep.

00:34:06.430 --> 00:34:09.170 align:middle line:84%
You wake up too early
or you don't sleep well.

00:34:09.170 --> 00:34:13.239 align:middle line:84%
And so I think those digital
signals are getting so strong,

00:34:13.239 --> 00:34:16.460 align:middle line:90%
especially during sleep time.

00:34:16.460 --> 00:34:18.940 align:middle line:84%
And so that's the
reason why I think

00:34:18.940 --> 00:34:21.400 align:middle line:84%
you do that bubble thing
again before you go to sleep.

00:34:21.400 --> 00:34:23.350 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: That's a good idea.

00:34:23.350 --> 00:34:27.040 align:middle line:84%
>>CORY: And you intend
to try to sleep soundly,

00:34:27.040 --> 00:34:32.020 align:middle line:84%
but also to stay protected
specifically during your sleep.

00:34:32.020 --> 00:34:34.060 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Yeah,
that's a good idea.

00:34:34.060 --> 00:34:34.983 align:middle line:90%
Thank you for that.

00:34:34.983 --> 00:34:37.150 align:middle line:84%
Now we'll get into something
a little more esoteric.

00:34:37.150 --> 00:34:40.510 align:middle line:84%
And that has to do with some
of the extraterrestrial kind

00:34:40.510 --> 00:34:44.949 align:middle line:84%
of lineages that we may be
part of and also influences

00:34:44.949 --> 00:34:47.469 align:middle line:84%
and how this affects our
consciousness in mass

00:34:47.469 --> 00:34:48.820 align:middle line:90%
and individually.

00:34:48.820 --> 00:34:51.610 align:middle line:84%
>>CORY: The biggest lesson
that I got from this experience

00:34:51.610 --> 00:34:55.270 align:middle line:84%
when I was five years
old was that those beings

00:34:55.270 --> 00:34:57.980 align:middle line:90%
were my lineage.

00:34:57.980 --> 00:34:59.650 align:middle line:90%
And it sounds simple.

00:34:59.650 --> 00:35:02.500 align:middle line:84%
But when you have
that experience,

00:35:02.500 --> 00:35:06.160 align:middle line:84%
it is so incredibly
powerful because you

00:35:06.160 --> 00:35:09.280 align:middle line:84%
start to realize, first of
all, that you aren't just

00:35:09.280 --> 00:35:10.660 align:middle line:90%
this body of course.

00:35:10.660 --> 00:35:15.910 align:middle line:84%
But then you tap into this
entire lineage of consciousness

00:35:15.910 --> 00:35:17.620 align:middle line:90%
that is universal.

00:35:17.620 --> 00:35:21.970 align:middle line:84%
So you kind of see the entire
potential that you came from.

00:35:21.970 --> 00:35:25.340 align:middle line:90%
And you understand you more.

00:35:25.340 --> 00:35:28.150 align:middle line:84%
And I realize that,
like I said, I

00:35:28.150 --> 00:35:31.270 align:middle line:84%
was on this side of the
veil as part of them.

00:35:31.270 --> 00:35:34.770 align:middle line:84%
And that connection
is never severed.

00:35:34.770 --> 00:35:36.400 align:middle line:84%
And you still have
to ask, you still

00:35:36.400 --> 00:35:39.640 align:middle line:84%
have to ask for it because
the communication that comes

00:35:39.640 --> 00:35:42.010 align:middle line:84%
to you-- these downloads,
this guidance, this higher

00:35:42.010 --> 00:35:44.960 align:middle line:84%
guidance-- is all
coming, technically,

00:35:44.960 --> 00:35:49.590 align:middle line:84%
or should be coming from
your own divine lineage.

00:35:49.590 --> 00:35:51.710 align:middle line:84%
And so this has a
lot to do with, then,

00:35:51.710 --> 00:35:55.580 align:middle line:84%
understanding why you are
here, what you're here to do,

00:35:55.580 --> 00:36:00.950 align:middle line:84%
why is this lineage necessary
to take on a human form

00:36:00.950 --> 00:36:05.180 align:middle line:84%
to come and show up in this
body as a female at this point

00:36:05.180 --> 00:36:07.320 align:middle line:90%
in time in Earth's history.

00:36:07.320 --> 00:36:12.650 align:middle line:84%
So that to me is crucial to
awakening or the ascension

00:36:12.650 --> 00:36:14.840 align:middle line:84%
and all these things
we talk about.

00:36:14.840 --> 00:36:17.930 align:middle line:84%
Because you start
to say, you start

00:36:17.930 --> 00:36:22.700 align:middle line:84%
to identify with you on a
much, much, much bigger scale

00:36:22.700 --> 00:36:24.770 align:middle line:90%
and understand your role.

00:36:24.770 --> 00:36:29.090 align:middle line:84%
And so I realized, then,
working with other people,

00:36:29.090 --> 00:36:31.020 align:middle line:84%
they weren't connected
the way I was.

00:36:31.020 --> 00:36:32.930 align:middle line:84%
So for example, I
would talk to someone

00:36:32.930 --> 00:36:34.520 align:middle line:84%
and then I would
see their lineage.

00:36:34.520 --> 00:36:37.130 align:middle line:84%
And it was like the
Pleiadians, for example.

00:36:37.130 --> 00:36:39.500 align:middle line:84%
Somebody else was
like the Arcturians.

00:36:39.500 --> 00:36:43.920 align:middle line:84%
Others were from this little
star very close to Earth.

00:36:43.920 --> 00:36:46.400 align:middle line:90%
So it's like a star-type being.

00:36:46.400 --> 00:36:50.000 align:middle line:84%
Others were very, very far
away from the universe.

00:36:50.000 --> 00:36:54.020 align:middle line:84%
And each one had a very
different signature.

00:36:54.020 --> 00:36:56.160 align:middle line:90%
It's very, very different.

00:36:56.160 --> 00:36:58.370 align:middle line:84%
So then you ask the
question, so why

00:36:58.370 --> 00:37:02.240 align:middle line:84%
aren't we all talking
to the same people?

00:37:02.240 --> 00:37:04.430 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And finding
out why each one is here.

00:37:04.430 --> 00:37:06.950 align:middle line:84%
This is really critical to
have that self-knowledge.

00:37:06.950 --> 00:37:09.650 align:middle line:84%
And I do-- the people
I speak to about as

00:37:09.650 --> 00:37:13.860 align:middle line:84%
my guides are actually my
family, my original family.

00:37:13.860 --> 00:37:14.660 align:middle line:90%
>>CORY: Yeah.

00:37:14.660 --> 00:37:16.490 align:middle line:84%
Exactly, so I call
them my spirit family.

00:37:16.490 --> 00:37:19.310 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: They're my soul
family from elsewhere.

00:37:19.310 --> 00:37:20.547 align:middle line:90%
>>CORY: And so I think--

00:37:20.547 --> 00:37:22.130 align:middle line:84%
because, of course,
we're not trained,

00:37:22.130 --> 00:37:23.600 align:middle line:84%
we're not taught
any of that stuff.

00:37:23.600 --> 00:37:25.100 align:middle line:84%
So we don't think
about it this way.

00:37:25.100 --> 00:37:29.210 align:middle line:84%
But those who are receiving
information or tapping

00:37:29.210 --> 00:37:31.610 align:middle line:84%
into extraterrestrial,
sometimes they

00:37:31.610 --> 00:37:36.420 align:middle line:84%
think they're ETs just floating
around, like talking to them,

00:37:36.420 --> 00:37:37.830 align:middle line:90%
helping them, guiding them.

00:37:37.830 --> 00:37:41.510 align:middle line:84%
But when you start to understand
that it's part of your lineage,

00:37:41.510 --> 00:37:43.520 align:middle line:90%
it changes the whole dynamic.

00:37:43.520 --> 00:37:46.400 align:middle line:84%
Like I said, it's something
on a cellular level awakens

00:37:46.400 --> 00:37:48.950 align:middle line:84%
within you that
moves you forward

00:37:48.950 --> 00:37:52.460 align:middle line:84%
on your path to keep asking,
so what is my mission?

00:37:52.460 --> 00:37:53.470 align:middle line:90%
And how do I proceed?

00:37:53.470 --> 00:37:55.070 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Absolutely,
that is so important.

00:37:55.070 --> 00:37:55.870 align:middle line:90%
>>CORY: Yeah.

00:37:55.870 --> 00:37:57.830 align:middle line:90%
And then how do I share?

00:37:57.830 --> 00:38:04.130 align:middle line:84%
How do I broadcast that lineage
into the collective human

00:38:04.130 --> 00:38:05.090 align:middle line:90%
consciousness?

00:38:05.090 --> 00:38:06.548 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Because
it does this take

00:38:06.548 --> 00:38:10.220 align:middle line:84%
the influence of many different
types of consciousness

00:38:10.220 --> 00:38:12.200 align:middle line:84%
and beings from
different universes,

00:38:12.200 --> 00:38:14.540 align:middle line:84%
from different dimensions
or interdimensionals

00:38:14.540 --> 00:38:16.700 align:middle line:84%
also that don't have
that physicality.

00:38:16.700 --> 00:38:17.600 align:middle line:90%
It doesn't matter.

00:38:17.600 --> 00:38:21.035 align:middle line:84%
It takes all of that to
create this beautiful web

00:38:21.035 --> 00:38:24.330 align:middle line:84%
of consciousness and emerging
knowledge on the planet.

00:38:24.330 --> 00:38:25.130 align:middle line:90%
>>CORY: Exactly.

00:38:25.130 --> 00:38:28.190 align:middle line:84%
And that is how we
are contributing

00:38:28.190 --> 00:38:29.390 align:middle line:90%
to the human evolution.

00:38:29.390 --> 00:38:30.740 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes, yes.

00:38:30.740 --> 00:38:32.750 align:middle line:84%
>>CORY: Because we've
never, you've never,

00:38:32.750 --> 00:38:36.050 align:middle line:84%
come in this particular package
at this particular time,

00:38:36.050 --> 00:38:38.040 align:middle line:84%
same with me, same
with everyone.

00:38:38.040 --> 00:38:40.650 align:middle line:84%
And so we're all
hybrid, so to speak.

00:38:40.650 --> 00:38:44.360 align:middle line:84%
We have our human packaging,
just to function as a human.

00:38:44.360 --> 00:38:48.890 align:middle line:84%
But we have that divine,
galactic, or universal lineage

00:38:48.890 --> 00:38:50.540 align:middle line:90%
at the same time.

00:38:50.540 --> 00:38:53.060 align:middle line:84%
And every time I speak,
every time I teach,

00:38:53.060 --> 00:38:54.860 align:middle line:84%
every time I heal,
every time I write

00:38:54.860 --> 00:38:58.280 align:middle line:84%
a book, whatever
I broadcast, I am

00:38:58.280 --> 00:39:03.810 align:middle line:84%
pouring into the collective
consciousness both my lineages.

00:39:03.810 --> 00:39:06.300 align:middle line:84%
And so same with you,
same with everyone.

00:39:06.300 --> 00:39:09.570 align:middle line:84%
And so when we start to look
at it from that perspective,

00:39:09.570 --> 00:39:14.300 align:middle line:84%
we realize how important
we are and how crucial

00:39:14.300 --> 00:39:16.280 align:middle line:90%
we are to the evolution.

00:39:16.280 --> 00:39:21.150 align:middle line:84%
We're moving forward the
human evolution in this way.

00:39:21.150 --> 00:39:24.180 align:middle line:84%
And so we stop thinking what
is my purpose, what should I

00:39:24.180 --> 00:39:24.980 align:middle line:90%
be doing?

00:39:24.980 --> 00:39:27.765 align:middle line:84%
It's not about doing,
it's more about being--

00:39:27.765 --> 00:39:28.640 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Being that.

00:39:28.640 --> 00:39:32.840 align:middle line:84%
>>CORY: --being that lineage
and emanating that lineage.

00:39:32.840 --> 00:39:34.880 align:middle line:84%
So that's why I think
this understanding is

00:39:34.880 --> 00:39:38.000 align:middle line:84%
so important, because then you
start doing it consciously.

00:39:38.000 --> 00:39:41.630 align:middle line:84%
And then your signal is
that much more amplified.

00:39:41.630 --> 00:39:43.967 align:middle line:84%
And your impact is that
much more amplified.

00:39:43.967 --> 00:39:45.300 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: I couldn't agree more.

00:39:45.300 --> 00:39:46.758 align:middle line:84%
And thank you for
bringing that up,

00:39:46.758 --> 00:39:48.230 align:middle line:90%
because it's seldom brought up.

00:39:48.230 --> 00:39:51.860 align:middle line:84%
And walking around on
the planet lifetime

00:39:51.860 --> 00:39:54.410 align:middle line:84%
after lifetime with
blindfolds on and not knowing

00:39:54.410 --> 00:39:57.170 align:middle line:84%
what we're doing here, not
knowing where we're from,

00:39:57.170 --> 00:40:02.860 align:middle line:84%
not knowing what we're here to
contribute, to me that's sad.

00:40:02.860 --> 00:40:06.710 align:middle line:84%
And a lot of people are
living with that blindfold on.

00:40:06.710 --> 00:40:08.400 align:middle line:90%
And it's time to take it off.

00:40:08.400 --> 00:40:11.360 align:middle line:84%
And I know that what you
do-- and your film will

00:40:11.360 --> 00:40:14.330 align:middle line:84%
help awaken people, but
also the way you teach,

00:40:14.330 --> 00:40:16.460 align:middle line:84%
and the way some other
people teach as well,

00:40:16.460 --> 00:40:17.910 align:middle line:90%
find what works for you.

00:40:17.910 --> 00:40:20.880 align:middle line:84%
But to essentially
set the intention

00:40:20.880 --> 00:40:23.150 align:middle line:90%
I want to know myself.

00:40:23.150 --> 00:40:24.500 align:middle line:90%
Show me myself.

00:40:24.500 --> 00:40:29.330 align:middle line:84%
And let yourself start to
have feelings, or a sound,

00:40:29.330 --> 00:40:31.140 align:middle line:90%
or a vision, or words.

00:40:31.140 --> 00:40:33.990 align:middle line:84%
It doesn't really matter how it
comes, because each person is

00:40:33.990 --> 00:40:34.790 align:middle line:90%
different.

00:40:34.790 --> 00:40:38.600 align:middle line:84%
But to allow that to emerge
from you, from your soul

00:40:38.600 --> 00:40:41.100 align:middle line:90%
family to you, so important.

00:40:41.100 --> 00:40:42.620 align:middle line:84%
So I'm assuming
that's part of what

00:40:42.620 --> 00:40:44.755 align:middle line:84%
you do is helping people
connect with that.

00:40:44.755 --> 00:40:45.555 align:middle line:90%
>>CORY: Absolutely.

00:40:45.555 --> 00:40:46.597 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Very important.

00:40:46.597 --> 00:40:49.740 align:middle line:84%
>>CORY: So yeah,
so for me there's

00:40:49.740 --> 00:40:51.690 align:middle line:84%
this meditation on
my YouTube actually.

00:40:51.690 --> 00:40:54.280 align:middle line:84%
It's called "Remembering
Who You Really Are."

00:40:54.280 --> 00:40:56.520 align:middle line:84%
So through guided
meditations, you kind of

00:40:56.520 --> 00:41:01.260 align:middle line:84%
get to start to experience the
human versus the divine lineage

00:41:01.260 --> 00:41:05.310 align:middle line:84%
that's within you and start
to tap into that signature.

00:41:05.310 --> 00:41:07.890 align:middle line:84%
But also I teach
this course called

00:41:07.890 --> 00:41:10.800 align:middle line:84%
Mastering the Human
Mind, which is, again,

00:41:10.800 --> 00:41:14.880 align:middle line:84%
starting to discern all these
different types of energies

00:41:14.880 --> 00:41:18.210 align:middle line:84%
in your body, in the energy
field, and on the planet,

00:41:18.210 --> 00:41:20.700 align:middle line:84%
but then all the way
into the universe.

00:41:20.700 --> 00:41:22.470 align:middle line:84%
Just like I did
with my meditation,

00:41:22.470 --> 00:41:25.890 align:middle line:84%
just that discernment
starts to kind of allow

00:41:25.890 --> 00:41:28.050 align:middle line:90%
you to recognize you.

00:41:28.050 --> 00:41:32.640 align:middle line:84%
Like, wait, when I merge with
the galaxy or with this star,

00:41:32.640 --> 00:41:34.390 align:middle line:90%
I feel at home.

00:41:34.390 --> 00:41:35.190 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:41:35.190 --> 00:41:35.760 align:middle line:90%
>>CORY: You know what I mean?

00:41:35.760 --> 00:41:36.240 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Oh, yeah.

00:41:36.240 --> 00:41:38.532 align:middle line:84%
>>CORY: Somebody else doesn't
really feel at home here,

00:41:38.532 --> 00:41:39.580 align:middle line:90%
feels at home here.

00:41:39.580 --> 00:41:42.300 align:middle line:84%
And so I think that's
through experiencing

00:41:42.300 --> 00:41:46.080 align:middle line:84%
on a cellular level those
different layers of reality,

00:41:46.080 --> 00:41:49.080 align:middle line:84%
that's how you start to kind
of recognize your own signature

00:41:49.080 --> 00:41:51.310 align:middle line:90%
and your own lineage.

00:41:51.310 --> 00:41:56.310 align:middle line:84%
And so I think people think,
well, maybe it's hard.

00:41:56.310 --> 00:41:59.970 align:middle line:84%
Like how do I make
the connection

00:41:59.970 --> 00:42:05.340 align:middle line:84%
that you have to have,
do all this work?

00:42:05.340 --> 00:42:07.740 align:middle line:84%
Or for example, they are
getting the guidance,

00:42:07.740 --> 00:42:12.190 align:middle line:84%
like I was saying earlier, but
are unclear about the method.

00:42:12.190 --> 00:42:15.570 align:middle line:84%
And I think it's just because
we weren't trained, that's all.

00:42:15.570 --> 00:42:17.970 align:middle line:84%
I don't think we
should worry about--

00:42:17.970 --> 00:42:18.960 align:middle line:90%
it doesn't matter.

00:42:18.960 --> 00:42:20.880 align:middle line:84%
If you want to do it,
like you were saying,

00:42:20.880 --> 00:42:24.750 align:middle line:84%
the first thing is begin by
saying, this is what I want.

00:42:24.750 --> 00:42:27.870 align:middle line:84%
At this point in my life
and my career on Earth,

00:42:27.870 --> 00:42:30.190 align:middle line:84%
I just want to be
who I really am.

00:42:30.190 --> 00:42:30.990 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:42:30.990 --> 00:42:32.070 align:middle line:90%
It starts with that.

00:42:32.070 --> 00:42:34.642 align:middle line:84%
And then you can add
on protocols, courses,

00:42:34.642 --> 00:42:35.850 align:middle line:90%
whatever else you want to do.

00:42:35.850 --> 00:42:36.430 align:middle line:90%
>>CORY: Exactly.

00:42:36.430 --> 00:42:38.013 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And sometimes
it just comes.

00:42:38.013 --> 00:42:39.300 align:middle line:90%
>>CORY: Exactly, exactly.

00:42:39.300 --> 00:42:41.008 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: We only have
a few minutes left

00:42:41.008 --> 00:42:43.350 align:middle line:84%
and I'd really like to
talk about something-- back

00:42:43.350 --> 00:42:46.230 align:middle line:84%
to my original passion,
which is truth, trying

00:42:46.230 --> 00:42:49.740 align:middle line:84%
to unearth common truth,
common truth to all,

00:42:49.740 --> 00:42:53.010 align:middle line:90%
not subjective truth.

00:42:53.010 --> 00:42:57.060 align:middle line:84%
And we have had such a crisis
on the planet as of late.

00:42:57.060 --> 00:42:59.940 align:middle line:90%


00:42:59.940 --> 00:43:03.510 align:middle line:84%
It has resulted from
groupthink and kind

00:43:03.510 --> 00:43:08.370 align:middle line:84%
of group mesmerization, which
is fulfilling something that's

00:43:08.370 --> 00:43:11.760 align:middle line:84%
been missing in us
that we would succumb

00:43:11.760 --> 00:43:14.340 align:middle line:90%
to this groupthink at this time.

00:43:14.340 --> 00:43:16.840 align:middle line:84%
Because it's common,
it's really common.

00:43:16.840 --> 00:43:19.350 align:middle line:84%
We've always done it through
religions and other things,

00:43:19.350 --> 00:43:24.165 align:middle line:84%
but right now it's an epidemic
level in terms of the effects

00:43:24.165 --> 00:43:25.290 align:middle line:90%
we're seeing on the planet.

00:43:25.290 --> 00:43:31.080 align:middle line:84%
Can you talk to the whole notion
of using the super human aspect

00:43:31.080 --> 00:43:34.950 align:middle line:84%
of self for discerning
what we could consider

00:43:34.950 --> 00:43:38.100 align:middle line:84%
more absolute truths,
which often merge

00:43:38.100 --> 00:43:39.690 align:middle line:90%
with virtues and other things?

00:43:39.690 --> 00:43:44.530 align:middle line:84%
>>CORY: Yeah, and on top of
being told this is the truth,

00:43:44.530 --> 00:43:47.340 align:middle line:84%
this is the truth, no,
don't believe him, the media

00:43:47.340 --> 00:43:48.920 align:middle line:90%
this, the politicians that.

00:43:48.920 --> 00:43:50.170 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Not externals, yeah.

00:43:50.170 --> 00:43:53.350 align:middle line:84%
>>CORY: In addition
to all of this,

00:43:53.350 --> 00:43:56.870 align:middle line:84%
we even have technology
that fools you.

00:43:56.870 --> 00:43:58.800 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes, indeed.

00:43:58.800 --> 00:44:01.970 align:middle line:84%
>>CORY: To think that you're
watching this person on video

00:44:01.970 --> 00:44:03.878 align:middle line:90%
when you're not--

00:44:03.878 --> 00:44:05.670 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Even just
that even just the film

00:44:05.670 --> 00:44:08.730 align:middle line:84%
"Social Dilemma," one of
the most important films

00:44:08.730 --> 00:44:12.360 align:middle line:84%
of our times to see how
your mind is manipulated

00:44:12.360 --> 00:44:18.180 align:middle line:84%
and how you're drawn in
without your consent even, just

00:44:18.180 --> 00:44:20.700 align:middle line:90%
unconsciously drawn in.

00:44:20.700 --> 00:44:22.780 align:middle line:90%
Everyone has to watch that.

00:44:22.780 --> 00:44:23.580 align:middle line:90%
Go ahead.

00:44:23.580 --> 00:44:28.680 align:middle line:84%
>>CORY: Yeah, so it's
definitely a massive problem.

00:44:28.680 --> 00:44:32.740 align:middle line:84%
And it's at a degree like
we've never seen before.

00:44:32.740 --> 00:44:35.550 align:middle line:84%
And so more than
ever before, we need

00:44:35.550 --> 00:44:37.350 align:middle line:84%
to have that level
of discernment.

00:44:37.350 --> 00:44:41.880 align:middle line:84%
So that's the reason
why I, honestly, think

00:44:41.880 --> 00:44:43.740 align:middle line:90%
that the film "Superhuman--

00:44:43.740 --> 00:44:47.637 align:middle line:84%
The Invisible Made
Visible" is very timely.

00:44:47.637 --> 00:44:48.720 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: I think so, too.

00:44:48.720 --> 00:44:50.178 align:middle line:84%
>>CORY: Because
all we have when we

00:44:50.178 --> 00:44:54.270 align:middle line:84%
are bombarded by this, and
this, and this, and that,

00:44:54.270 --> 00:44:58.890 align:middle line:84%
the good news is that we need
to realize that we shouldn't

00:44:58.890 --> 00:45:01.950 align:middle line:84%
be believing in any of
this that's outside of us

00:45:01.950 --> 00:45:04.530 align:middle line:90%
and bring the power back to us.

00:45:04.530 --> 00:45:05.490 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Absolutely.

00:45:05.490 --> 00:45:08.040 align:middle line:84%
>>CORY: And that's what I'm
hoping to do with the film

00:45:08.040 --> 00:45:10.350 align:middle line:84%
because the film,
that's all it does

00:45:10.350 --> 00:45:15.280 align:middle line:84%
is showing the power,
the effect of your mind,

00:45:15.280 --> 00:45:16.740 align:middle line:84%
your intention,
your consciousness

00:45:16.740 --> 00:45:18.750 align:middle line:84%
on the physical
world over, and over,

00:45:18.750 --> 00:45:20.010 align:middle line:90%
and over through experiments.

00:45:20.010 --> 00:45:23.120 align:middle line:84%
We didn't talk about it, but
remote viewing, then the pH.

00:45:23.120 --> 00:45:25.620 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And I've done a number
of shows on remote viewing,

00:45:25.620 --> 00:45:26.760 align:middle line:90%
so people know what it is.

00:45:26.760 --> 00:45:28.620 align:middle line:90%
So that's OK.

00:45:28.620 --> 00:45:31.530 align:middle line:84%
>>CORY: So in the film,
we're showing over, and over,

00:45:31.530 --> 00:45:37.110 align:middle line:84%
and over proof that your mind
is not this abstract thing

00:45:37.110 --> 00:45:39.350 align:middle line:84%
that, hopefully, it's
doing something somewhere

00:45:39.350 --> 00:45:40.150 align:middle line:90%
in the ether.

00:45:40.150 --> 00:45:41.520 align:middle line:90%
No, no, no, no, no.

00:45:41.520 --> 00:45:44.170 align:middle line:84%
Every time you think, every
time you have an intention,

00:45:44.170 --> 00:45:48.100 align:middle line:84%
you literally have a measurable
effect on the physical world.

00:45:48.100 --> 00:45:50.970 align:middle line:84%
And so that's the reason
why I'm hoping the film

00:45:50.970 --> 00:45:54.540 align:middle line:84%
will empower people to
bring back the ability

00:45:54.540 --> 00:45:59.850 align:middle line:84%
to find the truth by starting
with empowering themselves

00:45:59.850 --> 00:46:02.460 align:middle line:90%
with that intention.

00:46:02.460 --> 00:46:05.250 align:middle line:84%
I am the one that's
going to find the truth.

00:46:05.250 --> 00:46:10.680 align:middle line:84%
I want to know my truth
and to just basically stop

00:46:10.680 --> 00:46:13.243 align:middle line:84%
receiving the information
from outside of you

00:46:13.243 --> 00:46:14.910 align:middle line:84%
and bringing back the
truth from within.

00:46:14.910 --> 00:46:15.993 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Inner authority.

00:46:15.993 --> 00:46:17.370 align:middle line:90%
Inner authority.

00:46:17.370 --> 00:46:19.440 align:middle line:90%
We've given it away.

00:46:19.440 --> 00:46:21.500 align:middle line:84%
We know it's time
to buy it back.

00:46:21.500 --> 00:46:23.670 align:middle line:84%
And again, like you said,
very simply starting

00:46:23.670 --> 00:46:26.710 align:middle line:84%
with that intention, but it also
means some alteration sometimes

00:46:26.710 --> 00:46:27.510 align:middle line:90%
in our life.

00:46:27.510 --> 00:46:30.900 align:middle line:84%
It means not participating in
certain kinds of activities,

00:46:30.900 --> 00:46:32.970 align:middle line:84%
media, relationships,
even that are

00:46:32.970 --> 00:46:34.570 align:middle line:90%
programming to the negative.

00:46:34.570 --> 00:46:35.370 align:middle line:90%
It's time.

00:46:35.370 --> 00:46:37.665 align:middle line:84%
We really have to
be diligent now.

00:46:37.665 --> 00:46:39.540 align:middle line:84%
We've seen the dangers
of going the other way

00:46:39.540 --> 00:46:41.700 align:middle line:90%
and being complacent and lazy.

00:46:41.700 --> 00:46:42.617 align:middle line:90%
Can't do that anymore.

00:46:42.617 --> 00:46:43.417 align:middle line:90%
>>CORY: Absolutely.

00:46:43.417 --> 00:46:45.210 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So I so much
appreciate the work

00:46:45.210 --> 00:46:46.440 align:middle line:90%
you've done in the world.

00:46:46.440 --> 00:46:49.200 align:middle line:84%
Where can people
find the documentary?

00:46:49.200 --> 00:46:53.830 align:middle line:84%
>>CORY: Actually, people can
go to superhumanfilm.com.

00:46:53.830 --> 00:46:54.630 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: OK, good.

00:46:54.630 --> 00:46:56.425 align:middle line:84%
>>CORY: But it is also
going to be on Gaia.

00:46:56.425 --> 00:46:58.050 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Oh, I'm so
glad to hear that.

00:46:58.050 --> 00:47:00.350 align:middle line:84%
It sounds like a perfect
fit for the Gaia audience.

00:47:00.350 --> 00:47:01.150 align:middle line:90%
I'm so glad.

00:47:01.150 --> 00:47:02.983 align:middle line:84%
I'm glad you worked
something out with them.

00:47:02.983 --> 00:47:04.500 align:middle line:90%
>>CORY: Yes, absolutely.

00:47:04.500 --> 00:47:07.620 align:middle line:84%
And like I said, the film
is not just inspirational,

00:47:07.620 --> 00:47:09.210 align:middle line:90%
but it's practical.

00:47:09.210 --> 00:47:11.440 align:middle line:84%
So people can go out and
just try these things.

00:47:11.440 --> 00:47:12.810 align:middle line:90%
So that's why I'm very excited.

00:47:12.810 --> 00:47:13.200 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: I love it.

00:47:13.200 --> 00:47:14.300 align:middle line:90%
You should be excited.

00:47:14.300 --> 00:47:15.100 align:middle line:90%
I love it.

00:47:15.100 --> 00:47:16.410 align:middle line:90%
And so should everybody else.

00:47:16.410 --> 00:47:18.400 align:middle line:84%
Because I researched
this without watching

00:47:18.400 --> 00:47:19.200 align:middle line:90%
the film first.

00:47:19.200 --> 00:47:22.080 align:middle line:84%
So I'm so I'm excited, because I
get to have this new experience

00:47:22.080 --> 00:47:22.880 align:middle line:90%
myself.

00:47:22.880 --> 00:47:23.820 align:middle line:90%
>>CORY: Awesome.

00:47:23.820 --> 00:47:28.320 align:middle line:10%
The website is
superhumanfilm.com.

00:47:28.320 --> 00:47:30.540 align:middle line:10%
And actually on
the website, they

00:47:30.540 --> 00:47:32.155 align:middle line:10%
will see courses
if they want to--

00:47:32.155 --> 00:47:33.030 align:middle line:10%
>>REGINA: Yeah, yeah.

00:47:33.030 --> 00:47:34.950 align:middle line:90%
>>CORY: --on telekinesis--

00:47:34.950 --> 00:47:36.870 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Omnium universe
or a different one?

00:47:36.870 --> 00:47:37.260 align:middle line:90%
>>CORY: Both.

00:47:37.260 --> 00:47:37.710 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: OK, good.

00:47:37.710 --> 00:47:40.200 align:middle line:84%
>>CORY: But Superhuman film
is the film and the classes,

00:47:40.200 --> 00:47:41.420 align:middle line:90%
the blindfold classes.

00:47:41.420 --> 00:47:44.340 align:middle line:84%
We taught a blindfold
series online

00:47:44.340 --> 00:47:46.650 align:middle line:90%
to adults and to children.

00:47:46.650 --> 00:47:48.810 align:middle line:84%
So if people want to
learn, they can do it.

00:47:48.810 --> 00:47:51.360 align:middle line:84%
If they want to do telekinesis,
remote viewing, all of that

00:47:51.360 --> 00:47:52.660 align:middle line:90%
is on the website as well.

00:47:52.660 --> 00:47:53.460 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Good.

00:47:53.460 --> 00:47:54.000 align:middle line:90%
Excellent.

00:47:54.000 --> 00:47:55.410 align:middle line:90%
So you have all kinds of tools.

00:47:55.410 --> 00:47:56.760 align:middle line:90%
Well you're a generous soul.

00:47:56.760 --> 00:47:58.800 align:middle line:84%
And you're a
wonderfully curious soul

00:47:58.800 --> 00:48:00.850 align:middle line:84%
and that allows all of
this to come forward.

00:48:00.850 --> 00:48:03.182 align:middle line:84%
So thank you for making
it available to all of us.

00:48:03.182 --> 00:48:04.390 align:middle line:90%
And thank you for being here.

00:48:04.390 --> 00:48:05.350 align:middle line:90%
>>CORY: Thanks for having me.
