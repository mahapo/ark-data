00:00:19.917 --> 00:00:21.750 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA MEREDITH: One
of my favorite people

00:00:21.750 --> 00:00:24.900 align:middle line:84%
in the entire world, Steven
Ross, is back with us.

00:00:24.900 --> 00:00:27.930 align:middle line:10%
What I love about Steven and
his work is that he has it all,

00:00:27.930 --> 00:00:29.340 align:middle line:10%
but makes no claims.

00:00:29.340 --> 00:00:31.950 align:middle line:84%
This is a great departure
from our self-promoting world

00:00:31.950 --> 00:00:33.360 align:middle line:90%
of spiritual gurus.

00:00:33.360 --> 00:00:36.632 align:middle line:84%
He simply is a healer,
teacher, and true mystic

00:00:36.632 --> 00:00:39.090 align:middle line:84%
who has gained my deep respect
through the years of knowing

00:00:39.090 --> 00:00:39.300 align:middle line:90%
him.

00:00:39.300 --> 00:00:40.800 align:middle line:84%
And I'm so happy to
have you back, Steven.

00:00:40.800 --> 00:00:41.970 align:middle line:84%
>>STEVEN ROSS:
Thank you, Regina.

00:00:41.970 --> 00:00:44.010 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: You know, discernment,
discernment, discernment.

00:00:44.010 --> 00:00:45.760 align:middle line:84%
There's just not a lot
of discernment out there.

00:00:45.760 --> 00:00:48.177 align:middle line:84%
And that's why I say such nice
things about you at the top

00:00:48.177 --> 00:00:54.720 align:middle line:84%
because people need to learn to
discern who is real out there

00:00:54.720 --> 00:00:57.918 align:middle line:84%
and who isn't because there
are a lot of charlatans.

00:00:57.918 --> 00:00:59.460 align:middle line:84%
There are a lot of
people who pump up

00:00:59.460 --> 00:01:03.960 align:middle line:84%
their numbers on social media
with one little trope or two.

00:01:03.960 --> 00:01:08.220 align:middle line:84%
And then people like you
quietly just do their work

00:01:08.220 --> 00:01:12.150 align:middle line:84%
in the background, freely
helping humanity, healing

00:01:12.150 --> 00:01:15.520 align:middle line:84%
on a profound level that most
people can't even comprehend.

00:01:15.520 --> 00:01:18.510 align:middle line:84%
So anyway, that's why
I like having you back.

00:01:18.510 --> 00:01:20.300 align:middle line:90%
>>ROSS: What an introduction.

00:01:20.300 --> 00:01:21.600 align:middle line:10%
Thank you so much.

00:01:21.600 --> 00:01:24.570 align:middle line:10%
I believe when we talk
about discernment,

00:01:24.570 --> 00:01:26.880 align:middle line:10%
it's aligned with
the word "trust."

00:01:26.880 --> 00:01:30.870 align:middle line:84%
And I believe that the majority
of people that I come across

00:01:30.870 --> 00:01:33.930 align:middle line:90%
don't trust their self.

00:01:33.930 --> 00:01:38.340 align:middle line:84%
They don't trust that what they
believe, or what they feel,

00:01:38.340 --> 00:01:42.450 align:middle line:84%
or what they sense is
going to be the truth.

00:01:42.450 --> 00:01:45.120 align:middle line:84%
And because of
that, they're going

00:01:45.120 --> 00:01:48.240 align:middle line:84%
to rely on anybody
else, everything

00:01:48.240 --> 00:01:52.230 align:middle line:84%
outside of themselves, rather
than what they're truly

00:01:52.230 --> 00:01:53.380 align:middle line:90%
picking up.

00:01:53.380 --> 00:01:55.050 align:middle line:84%
And a lot of times,
I've met people

00:01:55.050 --> 00:01:59.310 align:middle line:84%
who have associated or
joined certain groups.

00:01:59.310 --> 00:02:02.940 align:middle line:84%
And they may even go further
than the leader of that group,

00:02:02.940 --> 00:02:08.100 align:middle line:84%
either with esoteric
abilities or sensitivity.

00:02:08.100 --> 00:02:10.830 align:middle line:84%
And immediately, they
become an outcast

00:02:10.830 --> 00:02:13.690 align:middle line:84%
because they've
surpassed the teacher.

00:02:13.690 --> 00:02:16.920 align:middle line:84%
So for me, I believe the
greatest message I can share

00:02:16.920 --> 00:02:20.280 align:middle line:90%
with people, trust yourself.

00:02:20.280 --> 00:02:21.450 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Absolutely.

00:02:21.450 --> 00:02:24.413 align:middle line:84%
And the thing is, why would
anyone trust themselves

00:02:24.413 --> 00:02:25.830 align:middle line:84%
in a world that's
designed to make

00:02:25.830 --> 00:02:29.530 align:middle line:84%
sure you give your power away
to everybody but yourself?

00:02:29.530 --> 00:02:31.950 align:middle line:84%
And that's the prevailing
reality of this world.

00:02:31.950 --> 00:02:36.380 align:middle line:84%
Whether you're born into a
tribe, a culture, a family,

00:02:36.380 --> 00:02:40.200 align:middle line:84%
a system with institutions,
all of the institutions

00:02:40.200 --> 00:02:41.670 align:middle line:84%
tell you to give
your power away.

00:02:41.670 --> 00:02:45.000 align:middle line:84%
From the educational system
to the medical industry

00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:46.590 align:middle line:84%
and so forth,
everything is designed

00:02:46.590 --> 00:02:49.710 align:middle line:84%
to tell you to not
trust yourself.

00:02:49.710 --> 00:02:51.330 align:middle line:84%
I mean, and a lot
of this conversation

00:02:51.330 --> 00:02:53.610 align:middle line:84%
we're going to be
having today has

00:02:53.610 --> 00:02:57.270 align:middle line:84%
to do with developing that
inner vertical relationship

00:02:57.270 --> 00:03:00.540 align:middle line:84%
with yourself, that divine
aspect that is already

00:03:00.540 --> 00:03:03.393 align:middle line:84%
connected to the alt
if you'll listen.

00:03:03.393 --> 00:03:04.810 align:middle line:84%
>>ROSS: And I love
being with you,

00:03:04.810 --> 00:03:07.980 align:middle line:84%
but if we can,
through this show,

00:03:07.980 --> 00:03:11.550 align:middle line:84%
do exactly what you just
said to empower people,

00:03:11.550 --> 00:03:13.200 align:middle line:90%
we have a beautiful show.

00:03:13.200 --> 00:03:14.850 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes, absolutely.

00:03:14.850 --> 00:03:18.460 align:middle line:84%
So we'll start by letting people
see an example of how this all

00:03:18.460 --> 00:03:19.260 align:middle line:90%
works.

00:03:19.260 --> 00:03:24.360 align:middle line:84%
And you and I have been on
a remarkably crazily kind

00:03:24.360 --> 00:03:28.350 align:middle line:90%
of similar path since the 1980s.

00:03:28.350 --> 00:03:31.320 align:middle line:84%
We've known a lot of
the same obscure people.

00:03:31.320 --> 00:03:35.100 align:middle line:84%
We went on the same trek through
Germany and France and England

00:03:35.100 --> 00:03:37.830 align:middle line:84%
to meet these incredible
people who are not

00:03:37.830 --> 00:03:41.590 align:middle line:84%
known at this time,
if at all, who

00:03:41.590 --> 00:03:44.920 align:middle line:84%
were working with vibrational
frequency devices, who

00:03:44.920 --> 00:03:47.190 align:middle line:84%
were making discoveries
and really bringing

00:03:47.190 --> 00:03:49.260 align:middle line:84%
through technology that
is just now starting

00:03:49.260 --> 00:03:53.860 align:middle line:84%
to make its way into common
knowledge today 35 years later,

00:03:53.860 --> 00:03:55.600 align:middle line:90%
30, 35 years later.

00:03:55.600 --> 00:04:00.300 align:middle line:84%
So with that, that's
the basis of our bond.

00:04:00.300 --> 00:04:03.000 align:middle line:84%
And what I learned
about you very early on

00:04:03.000 --> 00:04:05.445 align:middle line:90%
was your abilities in healing.

00:04:05.445 --> 00:04:07.070 align:middle line:84%
And that wasn't
something that was well

00:04:07.070 --> 00:04:09.400 align:middle line:84%
known because you were known
as the guy with the world

00:04:09.400 --> 00:04:10.200 align:middle line:90%
research.

00:04:10.200 --> 00:04:11.670 align:middle line:90%
We both lived in Sedona.

00:04:11.670 --> 00:04:14.070 align:middle line:84%
You were the guy with the
World Research Foundation.

00:04:14.070 --> 00:04:16.950 align:middle line:84%
And so for those who don't
know about the World Research

00:04:16.950 --> 00:04:19.680 align:middle line:84%
Foundation, let's just lay
a little framework for this

00:04:19.680 --> 00:04:20.940 align:middle line:90%
and tell them what it is.

00:04:20.940 --> 00:04:24.180 align:middle line:84%
>>ROSS: OK, when I
was in my university,

00:04:24.180 --> 00:04:27.630 align:middle line:84%
I was running track and
field in the late '60s,

00:04:27.630 --> 00:04:31.770 align:middle line:84%
and I sustained a knee
injury because a gardener had

00:04:31.770 --> 00:04:36.420 align:middle line:84%
left the sprinkler head
in our running track.

00:04:36.420 --> 00:04:39.030 align:middle line:84%
Because of the injury, I was
sent to the sports physician

00:04:39.030 --> 00:04:41.940 align:middle line:84%
for the Los Angeles
Dodgers, the Rams,

00:04:41.940 --> 00:04:44.970 align:middle line:84%
the Lakers who said I'd
have to have surgery or I

00:04:44.970 --> 00:04:46.680 align:middle line:90%
could never compete again.

00:04:46.680 --> 00:04:49.950 align:middle line:84%
For a second opinion, I
was sent to Ducky Drake,

00:04:49.950 --> 00:04:52.620 align:middle line:90%
who is the trainer at UCLA.

00:04:52.620 --> 00:04:56.070 align:middle line:84%
And I'm going to give away
our ages a little bit here,

00:04:56.070 --> 00:05:00.990 align:middle line:84%
but Kareem Jabbar was playing
for John Wooden at UCLA.

00:05:00.990 --> 00:05:02.473 align:middle line:90%
So people can figure how--

00:05:02.473 --> 00:05:03.890 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: This is
ancient history.

00:05:03.890 --> 00:05:06.510 align:middle line:84%
>>ROSS: It's ancient
history, exactly.

00:05:06.510 --> 00:05:07.860 align:middle line:90%
You have to have surgery.

00:05:07.860 --> 00:05:12.270 align:middle line:84%
Well, I was very dejected, went
back to my locker room at Cal

00:05:12.270 --> 00:05:13.710 align:middle line:90%
State Northridge.

00:05:13.710 --> 00:05:16.590 align:middle line:84%
And there was a popular
mechanics magazine.

00:05:16.590 --> 00:05:18.430 align:middle line:84%
I look at the
magazine, and it talked

00:05:18.430 --> 00:05:21.600 align:middle line:84%
about a healing technique
from the Soviet Union.

00:05:21.600 --> 00:05:24.640 align:middle line:84%
Well, I called
all these experts,

00:05:24.640 --> 00:05:29.830 align:middle line:84%
the head surgeon for Ram,
the Lakers, will this work?

00:05:29.830 --> 00:05:31.630 align:middle line:90%
No, it will not work.

00:05:31.630 --> 00:05:34.190 align:middle line:90%
I decided to try it myself.

00:05:34.190 --> 00:05:35.560 align:middle line:90%
I rectified my knee.

00:05:35.560 --> 00:05:39.040 align:middle line:84%
And that year, I finished fifth,
the top five for the United

00:05:39.040 --> 00:05:41.920 align:middle line:90%
States, in my running defense.

00:05:41.920 --> 00:05:46.450 align:middle line:84%
So it showed me that the
so-called experts didn't think

00:05:46.450 --> 00:05:49.120 align:middle line:90%
this would work, but it did.

00:05:49.120 --> 00:05:52.660 align:middle line:84%
And that impetus led
me to start wondering

00:05:52.660 --> 00:05:56.020 align:middle line:84%
what other techniques
exist in this world

00:05:56.020 --> 00:05:59.380 align:middle line:84%
that we don't know about
in the health field.

00:05:59.380 --> 00:06:05.650 align:middle line:84%
And this began the beginning of
the World Research Foundation

00:06:05.650 --> 00:06:10.180 align:middle line:84%
where I started going around
the world investigating

00:06:10.180 --> 00:06:14.060 align:middle line:84%
potential cures for cancer,
arthritis, diabetes,

00:06:14.060 --> 00:06:17.170 align:middle line:84%
and discovering there
were techniques used

00:06:17.170 --> 00:06:21.100 align:middle line:84%
outside of the United
States very successfully

00:06:21.100 --> 00:06:24.310 align:middle line:84%
that were not in
use in this country.

00:06:24.310 --> 00:06:27.140 align:middle line:10%
And we began storing--

00:06:27.140 --> 00:06:30.160 align:middle line:10%
up at this time now, we
have more than 20,000 books

00:06:30.160 --> 00:06:36.160 align:middle line:10%
dating to the 1400s in many,
many different specialties,

00:06:36.160 --> 00:06:40.780 align:middle line:10%
from color and sound
and acupuncture and cow

00:06:40.780 --> 00:06:41.950 align:middle line:10%
dung therapy.

00:06:41.950 --> 00:06:42.910 align:middle line:90%
Anything that's ever--

00:06:42.910 --> 00:06:44.290 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: To electrical therapy.

00:06:44.290 --> 00:06:45.220 align:middle line:90%
>>ROSS: All kinds.

00:06:45.220 --> 00:06:47.450 align:middle line:84%
Anything that's ever been
used, from ancient times

00:06:47.450 --> 00:06:48.250 align:middle line:90%
to the present.

00:06:48.250 --> 00:06:53.120 align:middle line:84%
So that has been my
baseline profession.

00:06:53.120 --> 00:06:54.970 align:middle line:84%
I've had a horrible
job of having

00:06:54.970 --> 00:06:59.620 align:middle line:84%
to travel the world, Regina,
investigating techniques,

00:06:59.620 --> 00:07:03.370 align:middle line:84%
healers, clinics, but
somebody had to do it.

00:07:03.370 --> 00:07:04.720 align:middle line:90%
Thank goodness it was me.

00:07:04.720 --> 00:07:06.762 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Oh, thank you
for making that sacrifice

00:07:06.762 --> 00:07:08.165 align:middle line:90%
on behalf of all of us.

00:07:08.165 --> 00:07:08.970 align:middle line:90%
>>ROSS: Thank you.

00:07:08.970 --> 00:07:14.410 align:middle line:84%
And I do want to comment
because you opened with you

00:07:14.410 --> 00:07:16.300 align:middle line:90%
and I had several paths.

00:07:16.300 --> 00:07:18.320 align:middle line:84%
We were just talking
before the show

00:07:18.320 --> 00:07:20.650 align:middle line:84%
that, within months
of each other,

00:07:20.650 --> 00:07:23.830 align:middle line:84%
we were meeting the
same individuals.

00:07:23.830 --> 00:07:27.250 align:middle line:84%
You recently came out with a
beautiful book on your life.

00:07:27.250 --> 00:07:33.220 align:middle line:84%
I've known you a long time, and
learned many incredible things

00:07:33.220 --> 00:07:35.030 align:middle line:90%
about you.

00:07:35.030 --> 00:07:40.990 align:middle line:84%
I am bringing this up because,
with a very diverse background,

00:07:40.990 --> 00:07:46.000 align:middle line:84%
look how we evolved, the
two of us, to finding

00:07:46.000 --> 00:07:49.060 align:middle line:84%
and investigating
in a certain area.

00:07:49.060 --> 00:07:52.900 align:middle line:84%
I'm bringing that up because
it should point out to people,

00:07:52.900 --> 00:07:56.350 align:middle line:84%
we aren't going to be the
same as somebody else,

00:07:56.350 --> 00:08:00.310 align:middle line:84%
but we have choices in the
pathways we're going to take.

00:08:00.310 --> 00:08:03.490 align:middle line:84%
And no matter what our
past upbringing was--

00:08:03.490 --> 00:08:04.780 align:middle line:90%
and there were similarities.

00:08:04.780 --> 00:08:06.710 align:middle line:90%
We've joked about it.

00:08:06.710 --> 00:08:11.260 align:middle line:84%
But there was enough
difference in our lifestyle,

00:08:11.260 --> 00:08:16.650 align:middle line:84%
but we ended up in basically
the same place on this show

00:08:16.650 --> 00:08:21.280 align:middle line:84%
today, which shows that it
doesn't make any difference

00:08:21.280 --> 00:08:22.225 align:middle line:90%
where somebody starts.

00:08:22.225 --> 00:08:24.100 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: It doesn't
matter where they start.

00:08:24.100 --> 00:08:29.170 align:middle line:84%
And what was interesting is
our crossing point literally

00:08:29.170 --> 00:08:31.090 align:middle line:84%
was the subject
of color therapy.

00:08:31.090 --> 00:08:34.659 align:middle line:84%
Both of us became fascinated
with the healing potential

00:08:34.659 --> 00:08:38.169 align:middle line:84%
of light and color at the
same time in our lives.

00:08:38.169 --> 00:08:39.730 align:middle line:90%
And I remember I was obsessed.

00:08:39.730 --> 00:08:40.820 align:middle line:90%
I read every book.

00:08:40.820 --> 00:08:41.890 align:middle line:90%
I could find on it.

00:08:41.890 --> 00:08:44.290 align:middle line:84%
Every book you
didn't personally own

00:08:44.290 --> 00:08:46.930 align:middle line:84%
that I could get my hands
on, I had read on the topic.

00:08:46.930 --> 00:08:49.450 align:middle line:84%
I was giving lectures in
my own naive little way

00:08:49.450 --> 00:08:54.310 align:middle line:84%
to rotary groups and telling
these elderly men who

00:08:54.310 --> 00:08:57.280 align:middle line:84%
were widowers how they could
attract the ladies again

00:08:57.280 --> 00:08:59.440 align:middle line:84%
with colors by
wearing pink shirts.

00:08:59.440 --> 00:09:02.890 align:middle line:84%
And I was giving all kinds
of useful information

00:09:02.890 --> 00:09:04.570 align:middle line:90%
to society at large.

00:09:04.570 --> 00:09:06.340 align:middle line:84%
Meanwhile, we were
both on a hunt

00:09:06.340 --> 00:09:07.600 align:middle line:90%
for the frequencies behind it.

00:09:07.600 --> 00:09:09.220 align:middle line:84%
And that's what
landed us in Europe

00:09:09.220 --> 00:09:13.660 align:middle line:84%
with following the same trail
of the same people who are not

00:09:13.660 --> 00:09:17.650 align:middle line:84%
well-known to this day, but who
did absolutely remarkable work.

00:09:17.650 --> 00:09:21.520 align:middle line:84%
And I think back to Wolfgang
Ludwig in particular,

00:09:21.520 --> 00:09:27.940 align:middle line:84%
and what he was bringing
forward 32, 3, 4, 5 years ago.

00:09:27.940 --> 00:09:30.010 align:middle line:84%
That language is
just now making it

00:09:30.010 --> 00:09:31.880 align:middle line:84%
into the world of
quantum physics.

00:09:31.880 --> 00:09:32.680 align:middle line:90%
>>ROSS: Exactly.

00:09:32.680 --> 00:09:38.040 align:middle line:10%
And I remember visiting
him with my ex-wife.

00:09:38.040 --> 00:09:40.330 align:middle line:10%
And the first time
that I met him,

00:09:40.330 --> 00:09:44.460 align:middle line:10%
we were staying at his
home, and my ex-wife

00:09:44.460 --> 00:09:47.440 align:middle line:10%
is going through a
menstrual problem

00:09:47.440 --> 00:09:48.490 align:middle line:10%
and not talking about it.

00:09:48.490 --> 00:09:50.560 align:middle line:84%
She was just doubled
over with pain.

00:09:50.560 --> 00:09:52.330 align:middle line:90%
And here was Wolfgang.

00:09:52.330 --> 00:09:53.500 align:middle line:90%
He was bouncing around.

00:09:53.500 --> 00:09:55.090 align:middle line:90%
He noticed she has a problem.

00:09:55.090 --> 00:09:57.160 align:middle line:84%
And he looks at her,
are you in pain?

00:09:57.160 --> 00:10:02.380 align:middle line:84%
And he comes back with a
matchbook-sized electromagnetic

00:10:02.380 --> 00:10:06.640 align:middle line:84%
frequency device, dials it
up, gives her a little pouch,

00:10:06.640 --> 00:10:08.890 align:middle line:90%
puts in on her tummy.

00:10:08.890 --> 00:10:12.460 align:middle line:84%
And within the shortest
amount of time, it was gone.

00:10:12.460 --> 00:10:16.390 align:middle line:84%
And she didn't have that problem
for many periods after that.

00:10:16.390 --> 00:10:18.800 align:middle line:90%
He was just an incredible man.

00:10:18.800 --> 00:10:21.170 align:middle line:90%
We're talking the late 1980s.

00:10:21.170 --> 00:10:23.060 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:10:23.060 --> 00:10:25.370 align:middle line:84%
I mean, I found him
interesting as a person.

00:10:25.370 --> 00:10:28.640 align:middle line:84%
Like a lot of really brilliant
scientists and physicists,

00:10:28.640 --> 00:10:29.840 align:middle line:90%
he was not present.

00:10:29.840 --> 00:10:33.020 align:middle line:84%
His wife was a frau, who
knew how to take care of him,

00:10:33.020 --> 00:10:35.750 align:middle line:84%
to pack his lunch,
put him on the train,

00:10:35.750 --> 00:10:37.700 align:middle line:84%
and tell him where
to go and what to do.

00:10:37.700 --> 00:10:39.950 align:middle line:84%
And he couldn't have functioned
without her because he

00:10:39.950 --> 00:10:41.680 align:middle line:90%
was like a little poodle.

00:10:41.680 --> 00:10:44.725 align:middle line:84%
His mind was so active and
his hair stuck out like Bozo.

00:10:44.725 --> 00:10:47.720 align:middle line:84%
>>ROSS: I want to tell you an
interesting story about him.

00:10:47.720 --> 00:10:51.620 align:middle line:84%
I asked him how he got started
in the whole research area,

00:10:51.620 --> 00:10:53.030 align:middle line:90%
and where he was funded.

00:10:53.030 --> 00:10:54.650 align:middle line:90%
So he told me--

00:10:54.650 --> 00:10:56.810 align:middle line:84%
and I don't know if
you know that story--

00:10:56.810 --> 00:11:01.550 align:middle line:84%
but he went to a gambling
casino and looked

00:11:01.550 --> 00:11:03.050 align:middle line:90%
at the roulette wheel.

00:11:03.050 --> 00:11:06.230 align:middle line:84%
And he started noticing that
there was a certain pattern

00:11:06.230 --> 00:11:07.400 align:middle line:90%
of the numbers.

00:11:07.400 --> 00:11:10.460 align:middle line:84%
And then he started looking
at the actual person who

00:11:10.460 --> 00:11:13.700 align:middle line:84%
spun the ball, and
how they did it,

00:11:13.700 --> 00:11:16.520 align:middle line:84%
and the speed at which
they turned the wheel.

00:11:16.520 --> 00:11:20.000 align:middle line:84%
And he said he calculated
exactly how to do it.

00:11:20.000 --> 00:11:23.710 align:middle line:84%
Then he went to bigger
gambling houses and he knew--

00:11:23.710 --> 00:11:25.410 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Was he
winning at the table?

00:11:25.410 --> 00:11:26.420 align:middle line:90%
>>ROSS: Yes.

00:11:26.420 --> 00:11:28.592 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: I didn't know
this part of the story.

00:11:28.592 --> 00:11:30.800 align:middle line:84%
He didn't seem like someone
who would go to a casino.

00:11:30.800 --> 00:11:32.780 align:middle line:84%
>>ROSS: Well, it wasn't
about the betting.

00:11:32.780 --> 00:11:36.650 align:middle line:84%
It was about the speed
of the ball going around

00:11:36.650 --> 00:11:38.480 align:middle line:90%
and the wheel being spun.

00:11:38.480 --> 00:11:41.500 align:middle line:84%
And he made enough money
to begin his whole career

00:11:41.500 --> 00:11:43.890 align:middle line:90%
in science and engineering.

00:11:43.890 --> 00:11:45.180 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: I love that story.

00:11:45.180 --> 00:11:47.190 align:middle line:84%
No, you had never
shared that with me.

00:11:47.190 --> 00:11:49.790 align:middle line:84%
I came in at the point
he did his dissertation

00:11:49.790 --> 00:11:54.230 align:middle line:84%
on The Memory of Water,
i.e., homeopathics,

00:11:54.230 --> 00:11:57.140 align:middle line:84%
which of course, hadn't
really gained any reception

00:11:57.140 --> 00:11:58.830 align:middle line:90%
in the modern world.

00:11:58.830 --> 00:12:00.500 align:middle line:84%
And he did beautiful
work in that.

00:12:00.500 --> 00:12:02.640 align:middle line:84%
I mean, this man's mind
is, well, like yours.

00:12:02.640 --> 00:12:03.610 align:middle line:90%
It can go anywhere.

00:12:03.610 --> 00:12:05.360 align:middle line:84%
>>ROSS: But he was
also ended up, I think,

00:12:05.360 --> 00:12:06.965 align:middle line:90%
maybe with a hairdo like mind.

00:12:06.965 --> 00:12:08.090 align:middle line:90%
Too much activity up there.

00:12:08.090 --> 00:12:10.048 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: When I saw him,
he was halfway there.

00:12:10.048 --> 00:12:12.590 align:middle line:84%
He got a little rim of kind of
fringy red hair sticking out.

00:12:12.590 --> 00:12:16.210 align:middle line:84%
>>ROSS: By the end, he
has a 'do like I do.

00:12:16.210 --> 00:12:19.850 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Well anyway,
regardless of the hairstyle,

00:12:19.850 --> 00:12:23.150 align:middle line:84%
he brought an amazing
amount of brilliant insight

00:12:23.150 --> 00:12:26.180 align:middle line:84%
into how healing, the
frequencies of color,

00:12:26.180 --> 00:12:30.825 align:middle line:84%
the frequencies of sound, and
the frequencies of minerals

00:12:30.825 --> 00:12:31.625 align:middle line:90%
all work together.

00:12:31.625 --> 00:12:32.450 align:middle line:90%
>>ROSS: And the homeopathic--

00:12:32.450 --> 00:12:33.742 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: And the homeopathics.

00:12:33.742 --> 00:12:35.720 align:middle line:84%
And brought it through
this phase, soft laser.

00:12:35.720 --> 00:12:37.940 align:middle line:84%
I don't really
know if anything--

00:12:37.940 --> 00:12:39.160 align:middle line:90%
I mean, I just don't know.

00:12:39.160 --> 00:12:41.930 align:middle line:84%
It probably is that
sophisticated as really

00:12:41.930 --> 00:12:44.430 align:middle line:84%
moving around today,
any of those systems.

00:12:44.430 --> 00:12:46.760 align:middle line:84%
So we were both exposed
to this a long time ago

00:12:46.760 --> 00:12:48.755 align:middle line:84%
and had this faith in
this kind of thing.

00:12:48.755 --> 00:12:50.630 align:middle line:84%
And we had the faith in
our own understanding

00:12:50.630 --> 00:12:54.130 align:middle line:84%
that something was driving us
on this path of understanding.

00:12:54.130 --> 00:12:57.080 align:middle line:84%
You created the World
Research Foundation.

00:12:57.080 --> 00:12:59.270 align:middle line:84%
But in your own
path-- and we're going

00:12:59.270 --> 00:13:00.920 align:middle line:84%
to get to the subject
of dreams today

00:13:00.920 --> 00:13:03.560 align:middle line:84%
because you've written this
wonderful book, which is you're

00:13:03.560 --> 00:13:06.140 align:middle line:84%
fiddling with still
a little bit, right?

00:13:06.140 --> 00:13:06.940 align:middle line:90%
>>ROSS: I am, yes.

00:13:06.940 --> 00:13:08.780 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: We often
need it in dreaming.

00:13:08.780 --> 00:13:13.817 align:middle line:84%
And so you're a part of
the journey where you--

00:13:13.817 --> 00:13:15.650 align:middle line:84%
we've already talked
about-- you were really

00:13:15.650 --> 00:13:17.660 align:middle line:90%
kind of a world class athlete.

00:13:17.660 --> 00:13:20.160 align:middle line:84%
And when you wanted something,
you knew how to do it.

00:13:20.160 --> 00:13:22.280 align:middle line:90%
But you know how to use energy.

00:13:22.280 --> 00:13:25.760 align:middle line:84%
At what point did
your guides let

00:13:25.760 --> 00:13:27.740 align:middle line:84%
you know that it was
time for you to begin

00:13:27.740 --> 00:13:30.620 align:middle line:90%
employing this toward healing?

00:13:30.620 --> 00:13:32.720 align:middle line:84%
Because you heal in
an extraordinary way,

00:13:32.720 --> 00:13:36.410 align:middle line:84%
very efficient extraordinary way
that most people can't really

00:13:36.410 --> 00:13:37.738 align:middle line:90%
comprehend.

00:13:37.738 --> 00:13:39.530 align:middle line:84%
>>ROSS: Thank you for
asking this question.

00:13:39.530 --> 00:13:42.200 align:middle line:84%
I did know in
advance, but it leads

00:13:42.200 --> 00:13:46.580 align:middle line:84%
me to share that
after I graduated

00:13:46.580 --> 00:13:49.160 align:middle line:84%
from running track
and field, I started

00:13:49.160 --> 00:13:51.320 align:middle line:90%
playing competitive volleyball.

00:13:51.320 --> 00:13:54.800 align:middle line:84%
And they were just starting
into the pro leagues

00:13:54.800 --> 00:13:56.450 align:middle line:90%
and giving money.

00:13:56.450 --> 00:14:00.680 align:middle line:84%
So I worked my way
up in volleyball to,

00:14:00.680 --> 00:14:04.400 align:middle line:84%
what was the highest
ranking at that time, which

00:14:04.400 --> 00:14:06.388 align:middle line:90%
was a AAA ranking.

00:14:06.388 --> 00:14:08.180 align:middle line:84%
And when you played
volleyball tournaments,

00:14:08.180 --> 00:14:12.680 align:middle line:84%
you had to start early
Saturday morning.

00:14:12.680 --> 00:14:14.810 align:middle line:84%
It was a double
elimination tournament.

00:14:14.810 --> 00:14:18.440 align:middle line:84%
And the last team
standing Sunday night

00:14:18.440 --> 00:14:21.830 align:middle line:84%
was going to be the winner of
that volleyball tournament.

00:14:21.830 --> 00:14:25.860 align:middle line:84%
So I was playing in a very,
very large tournament.

00:14:25.860 --> 00:14:27.590 align:middle line:90%
It went the whole weekend.

00:14:27.590 --> 00:14:30.770 align:middle line:84%
Right before that, I had
been doing some healing work

00:14:30.770 --> 00:14:31.730 align:middle line:90%
with people.

00:14:31.730 --> 00:14:33.470 align:middle line:90%
I was always available.

00:14:33.470 --> 00:14:35.270 align:middle line:84%
When I got home
from the tournament,

00:14:35.270 --> 00:14:39.710 align:middle line:84%
there were seven calls
on my answering machine--

00:14:39.710 --> 00:14:41.960 align:middle line:84%
we didn't have cell
phones back then--

00:14:41.960 --> 00:14:45.200 align:middle line:84%
saying somebody was
trying to reach me.

00:14:45.200 --> 00:14:48.260 align:middle line:90%
They needed help.

00:14:48.260 --> 00:14:52.760 align:middle line:84%
When I heard that, I
felt a little guilty.

00:14:52.760 --> 00:14:54.590 align:middle line:84%
I didn't know what
the problem was.

00:14:54.590 --> 00:14:56.588 align:middle line:90%
And that night, I had a dream.

00:14:56.588 --> 00:14:57.630 align:middle line:90%
And the dream said this--

00:14:57.630 --> 00:14:58.970 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Why were they
calling you for help?

00:14:58.970 --> 00:15:01.100 align:middle line:84%
>>ROSS: Well, they were
calling because they needed

00:15:01.100 --> 00:15:04.070 align:middle line:84%
psychological
counseling, and they

00:15:04.070 --> 00:15:06.890 align:middle line:84%
had heard this was a person
I'd never met before,

00:15:06.890 --> 00:15:11.900 align:middle line:84%
who heard from somebody else,
who I was able to help them.

00:15:11.900 --> 00:15:15.050 align:middle line:84%
I went to bed that
night and I had a dream.

00:15:15.050 --> 00:15:18.030 align:middle line:84%
And somebody came to me,
and here's what they said.

00:15:18.030 --> 00:15:22.170 align:middle line:84%
What is more important to you,
smelly gym socks or your place

00:15:22.170 --> 00:15:24.220 align:middle line:90%
in the universe?

00:15:24.220 --> 00:15:28.380 align:middle line:84%
So when you asked me,
where was the transition,

00:15:28.380 --> 00:15:33.390 align:middle line:84%
I made a commitment that
my place in the universe

00:15:33.390 --> 00:15:35.310 align:middle line:90%
was more important to me.

00:15:35.310 --> 00:15:38.640 align:middle line:84%
Then even though it's the
beach and you don't wear socks,

00:15:38.640 --> 00:15:45.010 align:middle line:84%
the analogy was very plain
to me that I made a decision.

00:15:45.010 --> 00:15:48.570 align:middle line:84%
And even though I had the
highest rating on that weekend

00:15:48.570 --> 00:15:51.490 align:middle line:84%
you could get in volleyball,
I walked off the beach never

00:15:51.490 --> 00:15:52.740 align:middle line:90%
to play in a tournament again.

00:15:52.740 --> 00:15:55.410 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And two-man
volleyball, beach volleyball

00:15:55.410 --> 00:15:58.290 align:middle line:90%
is so demanding on the body.

00:15:58.290 --> 00:15:59.160 align:middle line:90%
I used to play it.

00:15:59.160 --> 00:16:00.480 align:middle line:90%
It is so hard.

00:16:00.480 --> 00:16:02.910 align:middle line:84%
>>ROSS: And that
was my commitment.

00:16:02.910 --> 00:16:06.420 align:middle line:84%
And from then on, I
have never looked back.

00:16:06.420 --> 00:16:12.030 align:middle line:84%
That was the start of much
more of a direct contact

00:16:12.030 --> 00:16:15.090 align:middle line:90%
for me, where the dreams--

00:16:15.090 --> 00:16:16.350 align:middle line:90%
I had profound dreams.

00:16:16.350 --> 00:16:18.630 align:middle line:84%
I think we're going to talk
about that a little later.

00:16:18.630 --> 00:16:19.430 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: We are.

00:16:19.430 --> 00:16:21.030 align:middle line:84%
>>ROSS: But that
really put it to me.

00:16:21.030 --> 00:16:22.450 align:middle line:90%
That was the transition.

00:16:22.450 --> 00:16:25.310 align:middle line:90%


00:16:25.310 --> 00:16:27.270 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: We'll talk
about the healing

00:16:27.270 --> 00:16:30.640 align:middle line:84%
just a bit before we
go into the dreams.

00:16:30.640 --> 00:16:35.190 align:middle line:84%
How did you come about the
technique that you use,

00:16:35.190 --> 00:16:39.070 align:middle line:84%
this elegant, simple
reality that you use?

00:16:39.070 --> 00:16:40.050 align:middle line:90%
And I have to say this.

00:16:40.050 --> 00:16:43.060 align:middle line:84%
We're not going to actually
talk about how you do it.

00:16:43.060 --> 00:16:44.620 align:middle line:90%
And the reason is this.

00:16:44.620 --> 00:16:50.130 align:middle line:84%
You have to have a
very focused mind,

00:16:50.130 --> 00:16:53.160 align:middle line:84%
and you have to have
a non-attachment.

00:16:53.160 --> 00:16:58.560 align:middle line:84%
You have to have an incredible
sense of unconditional love

00:16:58.560 --> 00:17:00.600 align:middle line:90%
that goes beyond personal love.

00:17:00.600 --> 00:17:02.190 align:middle line:84%
All these attributes
have to come

00:17:02.190 --> 00:17:05.400 align:middle line:84%
into a single moment
in order for a person

00:17:05.400 --> 00:17:07.300 align:middle line:90%
to do this effectively.

00:17:07.300 --> 00:17:09.430 align:middle line:90%
And there cannot be doubt.

00:17:09.430 --> 00:17:11.819 align:middle line:84%
And we talked about this
doubt, people having themselves

00:17:11.819 --> 00:17:12.727 align:middle line:90%
earlier.

00:17:12.727 --> 00:17:14.310 align:middle line:84%
So for most people
who would try this,

00:17:14.310 --> 00:17:16.380 align:middle line:84%
it actually probably
would not work very well.

00:17:16.380 --> 00:17:17.880 align:middle line:84%
And there's no point
in even talking

00:17:17.880 --> 00:17:20.099 align:middle line:84%
about that per se, but
the potential in someone

00:17:20.099 --> 00:17:23.670 align:middle line:84%
going on their own journey to
find the way in which they can

00:17:23.670 --> 00:17:26.760 align:middle line:84%
engage with healing, you're
an astounding example

00:17:26.760 --> 00:17:28.800 align:middle line:84%
of the heights at
which it can rise to.

00:17:28.800 --> 00:17:33.060 align:middle line:84%
But you have this
incredibly focused mind

00:17:33.060 --> 00:17:34.950 align:middle line:90%
that can create reality.

00:17:34.950 --> 00:17:36.270 align:middle line:90%
>>ROSS: It can.

00:17:36.270 --> 00:17:39.360 align:middle line:84%
And then sometimes
that mind is something

00:17:39.360 --> 00:17:42.140 align:middle line:90%
that we have to bypass.

00:17:42.140 --> 00:17:43.360 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: It is.

00:17:43.360 --> 00:17:48.870 align:middle line:84%
>>ROSS: There's that fine line
of being focused and staying

00:17:48.870 --> 00:17:50.350 align:middle line:90%
on a single point.

00:17:50.350 --> 00:17:58.350 align:middle line:84%
But very early in my life, I
remember I was not a big dater.

00:17:58.350 --> 00:17:59.880 align:middle line:90%
I was extremely shy.

00:17:59.880 --> 00:18:01.980 align:middle line:84%
People laugh because
I lecture in front

00:18:01.980 --> 00:18:08.180 align:middle line:84%
of 2,000, 4,000 people, but
I was very shy growing up.

00:18:08.180 --> 00:18:11.110 align:middle line:84%
And I was out on a
date with a young lady

00:18:11.110 --> 00:18:12.660 align:middle line:90%
I'd never met before.

00:18:12.660 --> 00:18:15.940 align:middle line:84%
And we went back to
her house after lunch.

00:18:15.940 --> 00:18:16.860 align:middle line:90%
We were sitting.

00:18:16.860 --> 00:18:17.820 align:middle line:90%
She sat in the chair.

00:18:17.820 --> 00:18:20.640 align:middle line:84%
I sat in the sofa
maybe 10 feet away.

00:18:20.640 --> 00:18:23.550 align:middle line:84%
And she was very nervous
for whatever reason.

00:18:23.550 --> 00:18:25.140 align:middle line:90%
I didn't know the reason.

00:18:25.140 --> 00:18:29.110 align:middle line:84%
And I looked at her and
I thought, oh my gosh,

00:18:29.110 --> 00:18:30.570 align:middle line:84%
I hope I'm not
making her nervous.

00:18:30.570 --> 00:18:33.900 align:middle line:84%
I wish I could just hold
her, but not in a sexual way.

00:18:33.900 --> 00:18:36.270 align:middle line:90%
Just hold her and relax.

00:18:36.270 --> 00:18:40.260 align:middle line:84%
At that moment she
says, you touched me.

00:18:40.260 --> 00:18:42.670 align:middle line:90%
Regina, I thought my heart was--

00:18:42.670 --> 00:18:44.310 align:middle line:90%
I didn't touch you!

00:18:44.310 --> 00:18:46.470 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: She's reading
my actions in my mind.

00:18:46.470 --> 00:18:47.490 align:middle line:90%
>>ROSS: You touched me.

00:18:47.490 --> 00:18:49.630 align:middle line:90%
You put your arms around me.

00:18:49.630 --> 00:18:53.070 align:middle line:90%
No, no, I did not, no I didn't.

00:18:53.070 --> 00:18:55.200 align:middle line:90%
And she said, no.

00:18:55.200 --> 00:18:58.050 align:middle line:90%
And she calmed down immediately.

00:18:58.050 --> 00:19:01.890 align:middle line:84%
And I realized that there
was something going on here

00:19:01.890 --> 00:19:05.790 align:middle line:84%
because I did it
out of just a love

00:19:05.790 --> 00:19:09.210 align:middle line:84%
that I saw somebody
who was in pain.

00:19:09.210 --> 00:19:12.180 align:middle line:84%
And from that time,
and then of course,

00:19:12.180 --> 00:19:17.520 align:middle line:84%
with more guidance through
my dreamer and the dreams,

00:19:17.520 --> 00:19:21.300 align:middle line:90%
I honed down a lot more.

00:19:21.300 --> 00:19:24.330 align:middle line:84%
Not too long after
that, maybe a week,

00:19:24.330 --> 00:19:28.050 align:middle line:84%
I get a call middle of
the night from a woman

00:19:28.050 --> 00:19:34.080 align:middle line:84%
who I met whose brother
had ODed on angel dust.

00:19:34.080 --> 00:19:36.930 align:middle line:84%
She was calling
from a phone booth.

00:19:36.930 --> 00:19:40.410 align:middle line:84%
She said her brother
was uncontrollable.

00:19:40.410 --> 00:19:41.400 align:middle line:90%
I said, where is he?

00:19:41.400 --> 00:19:43.530 align:middle line:90%
He's right here with me.

00:19:43.530 --> 00:19:47.040 align:middle line:84%
And then I heard a
voice in my head.

00:19:47.040 --> 00:19:49.300 align:middle line:90%
Give me words.

00:19:49.300 --> 00:19:52.630 align:middle line:84%
And I said, put the
phone next to his ear.

00:19:52.630 --> 00:19:53.520 align:middle line:90%
And I spoke.

00:19:53.520 --> 00:19:57.100 align:middle line:84%
And immediately,
he was rectified.

00:19:57.100 --> 00:19:59.415 align:middle line:90%
So I had experience--

00:19:59.415 --> 00:20:01.290 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Were the words
flowing through you?

00:20:01.290 --> 00:20:02.790 align:middle line:90%
>>ROSS: Flowing through me.

00:20:02.790 --> 00:20:04.080 align:middle line:90%
They didn't come from my mind.

00:20:04.080 --> 00:20:06.540 align:middle line:90%
They didn't come from logic.

00:20:06.540 --> 00:20:09.690 align:middle line:90%
They came from another area.

00:20:09.690 --> 00:20:13.230 align:middle line:84%
I'd say five years after
this experience with,

00:20:13.230 --> 00:20:17.270 align:middle line:84%
what's more important
your smelly gym socks,

00:20:17.270 --> 00:20:20.690 align:middle line:84%
I was called by a friend
up to Modesto, California.

00:20:20.690 --> 00:20:22.520 align:middle line:84%
People at that time
started knowing

00:20:22.520 --> 00:20:26.450 align:middle line:84%
that I was talking about
esoteric metaphysical things.

00:20:26.450 --> 00:20:29.430 align:middle line:84%
And people just like
to hear me talk.

00:20:29.430 --> 00:20:30.857 align:middle line:90%
Boy, that's great.

00:20:30.857 --> 00:20:32.690 align:middle line:84%
A lot of times, you
want people to be quiet,

00:20:32.690 --> 00:20:34.810 align:middle line:84%
but people give me an
invitation to talk.

00:20:34.810 --> 00:20:35.940 align:middle line:90%
So I take it.

00:20:35.940 --> 00:20:37.550 align:middle line:90%
So I go up to Modesto.

00:20:37.550 --> 00:20:42.390 align:middle line:84%
A good friend of mine said a
friend of hers opened her home.

00:20:42.390 --> 00:20:43.940 align:middle line:90%
She had a few people.

00:20:43.940 --> 00:20:45.883 align:middle line:90%
There were 30 people there.

00:20:45.883 --> 00:20:47.300 align:middle line:84%
We spoke through
the whole evening

00:20:47.300 --> 00:20:52.820 align:middle line:84%
about metaphysical things,
healing, electromagnetics.

00:20:52.820 --> 00:20:55.610 align:middle line:84%
I kept looking at the
woman whose home it was,

00:20:55.610 --> 00:20:56.580 align:middle line:90%
and she looked miffed.

00:20:56.580 --> 00:20:59.150 align:middle line:84%
She looked confused
the whole evening.

00:20:59.150 --> 00:21:05.340 align:middle line:84%
After everybody left, and
my friend and I helped

00:21:05.340 --> 00:21:09.710 align:middle line:84%
a woman clean up
and we were leaving,

00:21:09.710 --> 00:21:12.350 align:middle line:84%
I was given the
following words to tell

00:21:12.350 --> 00:21:15.410 align:middle line:90%
this woman, the household lady.

00:21:15.410 --> 00:21:17.930 align:middle line:84%
I looked at her like you
and I look, and I go,

00:21:17.930 --> 00:21:22.318 align:middle line:84%
I wish I was an
Oscar Mayer Wiener.

00:21:22.318 --> 00:21:23.360 align:middle line:90%
The woman starts bawling.

00:21:23.360 --> 00:21:24.275 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Oh, that's cryptic.

00:21:24.275 --> 00:21:25.190 align:middle line:90%
>>ROSS: She bawls.

00:21:25.190 --> 00:21:27.590 align:middle line:90%
She was uncontrollably crying.

00:21:27.590 --> 00:21:30.950 align:middle line:84%
My friend looks at
me like, Steve, what

00:21:30.950 --> 00:21:32.360 align:middle line:90%
have you done to my friend?

00:21:32.360 --> 00:21:34.340 align:middle line:90%
Why would you even say that?

00:21:34.340 --> 00:21:37.760 align:middle line:84%
I brought her back
into the house.

00:21:37.760 --> 00:21:41.570 align:middle line:84%
We calmed her down, and
here's what she said.

00:21:41.570 --> 00:21:44.810 align:middle line:84%
She said, all evening,
I listened to you

00:21:44.810 --> 00:21:50.180 align:middle line:84%
with your lighthearted
information, your demeanor,

00:21:50.180 --> 00:21:54.180 align:middle line:84%
talking about the
spiritual and healing.

00:21:54.180 --> 00:21:56.540 align:middle line:84%
And I was wondering could
this guy possibly really

00:21:56.540 --> 00:21:57.350 align:middle line:90%
have the goods?

00:21:57.350 --> 00:22:00.560 align:middle line:84%
I'm used to the people
saying, you've got to do this,

00:22:00.560 --> 00:22:01.950 align:middle line:90%
you've got to do that.

00:22:01.950 --> 00:22:04.370 align:middle line:84%
But she said, throughout
the whole night,

00:22:04.370 --> 00:22:07.880 align:middle line:84%
she couldn't get that stupid
commercial out of her head.

00:22:07.880 --> 00:22:10.820 align:middle line:84%
And when I relate that
commercial to her,

00:22:10.820 --> 00:22:14.000 align:middle line:84%
she believed that
I had the goods.

00:22:14.000 --> 00:22:18.680 align:middle line:84%
And for me, it
anchored in my faith

00:22:18.680 --> 00:22:21.080 align:middle line:84%
because if I had gone
by my mind, which

00:22:21.080 --> 00:22:24.440 align:middle line:84%
I did for one second, I'm going
to turn to a complete stranger

00:22:24.440 --> 00:22:27.008 align:middle line:84%
and say, I wish I was
an Oscar Mayer Wiener?

00:22:27.008 --> 00:22:29.300 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: It's like, no, I
think I'll edit it that one.

00:22:29.300 --> 00:22:30.508 align:middle line:90%
>>ROSS: That's exactly right.

00:22:30.508 --> 00:22:32.240 align:middle line:90%
I would never do it.

00:22:32.240 --> 00:22:33.950 align:middle line:90%
I did do it.

00:22:33.950 --> 00:22:38.810 align:middle line:84%
And the guidance that has
come in many different areas,

00:22:38.810 --> 00:22:42.260 align:middle line:84%
I have a trust because
I asked, as long

00:22:42.260 --> 00:22:48.890 align:middle line:84%
as it is always beneficial for
somebody else, I will share.

00:22:48.890 --> 00:22:52.190 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And the thing is
you've had the feedback.

00:22:52.190 --> 00:22:54.928 align:middle line:84%
I mean, I know you well
enough to know now.

00:22:54.928 --> 00:22:56.720 align:middle line:84%
I've been to the World
Research Foundation.

00:22:56.720 --> 00:22:58.720 align:middle line:84%
I've been to your home,
and your room of beauty,

00:22:58.720 --> 00:23:02.990 align:middle line:84%
and all these places, and
I've seen the evidence

00:23:02.990 --> 00:23:05.240 align:middle line:90%
that people have given you.

00:23:05.240 --> 00:23:07.190 align:middle line:84%
That what you've done
for them has worked.

00:23:07.190 --> 00:23:10.220 align:middle line:84%
And you've had so many
thousands of people

00:23:10.220 --> 00:23:13.070 align:middle line:84%
that you've worked with, that
you've been able to help.

00:23:13.070 --> 00:23:15.470 align:middle line:84%
and you haven't
even charged for it.

00:23:15.470 --> 00:23:17.870 align:middle line:84%
You just do it out of
the love for humanity.

00:23:17.870 --> 00:23:19.730 align:middle line:84%
>>ROSS: How can
I charge when I'm

00:23:19.730 --> 00:23:22.820 align:middle line:84%
giving these profound
pearls of wisdom

00:23:22.820 --> 00:23:25.028 align:middle line:84%
like, I wish I was an
Oscar Mayer Wiener.

00:23:25.028 --> 00:23:26.570 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: How do
you charge for that?

00:23:26.570 --> 00:23:27.060 align:middle line:90%
>>ROSS: Exactly.

00:23:27.060 --> 00:23:28.352 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: It'd be hard to bill.

00:23:28.352 --> 00:23:30.650 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHTER]

00:23:30.650 --> 00:23:32.510 align:middle line:90%
That is true.

00:23:32.510 --> 00:23:35.510 align:middle line:84%
So I just say that because
I happen to know you well,

00:23:35.510 --> 00:23:37.040 align:middle line:84%
and most people
don't know you well.

00:23:37.040 --> 00:23:38.750 align:middle line:84%
And that all of
this is very real.

00:23:38.750 --> 00:23:42.140 align:middle line:84%
And we're now working in a world
that most people call magic,

00:23:42.140 --> 00:23:43.650 align:middle line:90%
but it's not magic.

00:23:43.650 --> 00:23:45.890 align:middle line:84%
It is simply a person
who has brought together

00:23:45.890 --> 00:23:50.300 align:middle line:84%
faith in their higher guidance
from themselves and beyond,

00:23:50.300 --> 00:23:51.980 align:middle line:84%
together with an
understanding of how

00:23:51.980 --> 00:23:55.070 align:middle line:84%
to use the will, the
mind, and love together.

00:23:55.070 --> 00:23:58.185 align:middle line:84%
>>ROSS: The imagination,
faith, and will.

00:23:58.185 --> 00:23:59.060 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Absolutely.

00:23:59.060 --> 00:24:03.530 align:middle line:84%
>>ROSS: And the most important
part, everybody can do it.

00:24:03.530 --> 00:24:07.850 align:middle line:84%
When people say, Steve, you're
different, you're special.

00:24:07.850 --> 00:24:12.230 align:middle line:84%
No, I chose my place in
the universe, rather than

00:24:12.230 --> 00:24:13.237 align:middle line:90%
the smelly gym socks.

00:24:13.237 --> 00:24:14.570 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: And this is important.

00:24:14.570 --> 00:24:18.200 align:middle line:84%
You chose to employ those
aspects of your being

00:24:18.200 --> 00:24:19.790 align:middle line:90%
toward this purpose.

00:24:19.790 --> 00:24:20.600 align:middle line:90%
And you're right.

00:24:20.600 --> 00:24:23.225 align:middle line:84%
This is our birthright,
all of us as human beings.

00:24:23.225 --> 00:24:26.970 align:middle line:84%
That either we don't
have faith or we're lazy,

00:24:26.970 --> 00:24:29.240 align:middle line:84%
we don't want to really
employ and do the work.

00:24:29.240 --> 00:24:30.890 align:middle line:84%
There are always
reasons that stop us,

00:24:30.890 --> 00:24:34.070 align:middle line:84%
or we're afraid
because we don't want

00:24:34.070 --> 00:24:35.960 align:middle line:84%
to be made a fool of
in front of others

00:24:35.960 --> 00:24:37.613 align:middle line:84%
because we don't
want to be wrong.

00:24:37.613 --> 00:24:38.780 align:middle line:90%
And that's a really big one.

00:24:38.780 --> 00:24:41.240 align:middle line:84%
There are a lot of
really talented people

00:24:41.240 --> 00:24:44.717 align:middle line:84%
that actually do healing work,
but are afraid to come forward

00:24:44.717 --> 00:24:46.550 align:middle line:84%
because they don't want
to be made a fool of

00:24:46.550 --> 00:24:48.170 align:middle line:90%
and they don't want to be wrong.

00:24:48.170 --> 00:24:50.230 align:middle line:84%
And they don't want
it to not work, right?

00:24:50.230 --> 00:24:51.030 align:middle line:90%
>>ROSS: Exactly.

00:24:51.030 --> 00:24:53.230 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And that stops
a lot of natural healers.

00:24:53.230 --> 00:24:56.930 align:middle line:10%
>>ROSS: Well, a lot of people
feel you have to be 100%.

00:24:56.930 --> 00:25:01.700 align:middle line:10%
I know when I first started, I
was very fortunate because some

00:25:01.700 --> 00:25:05.600 align:middle line:10%
of the early beginnings, I had
inoperable brain cancer tumors

00:25:05.600 --> 00:25:08.750 align:middle line:10%
and breast tumors
and people in comas.

00:25:08.750 --> 00:25:14.150 align:middle line:84%
And being an athlete, and
being taught you have to win,

00:25:14.150 --> 00:25:16.700 align:middle line:84%
it was a little bit
difficult. But I

00:25:16.700 --> 00:25:20.510 align:middle line:84%
kept hearing guidance
going, you are not

00:25:20.510 --> 00:25:22.370 align:middle line:90%
the one who is responsible.

00:25:22.370 --> 00:25:25.940 align:middle line:84%
And I must tell you a story that
was given to me at that time.

00:25:25.940 --> 00:25:28.490 align:middle line:90%
It's about Zeke on his tractor.

00:25:28.490 --> 00:25:29.950 align:middle line:90%
Zeke is a farmer.

00:25:29.950 --> 00:25:30.960 align:middle line:90%
He's out in this field.

00:25:30.960 --> 00:25:32.270 align:middle line:90%
He's on his tractor.

00:25:32.270 --> 00:25:36.260 align:middle line:84%
He's going along and he
hears a voice go, "Zeke."

00:25:36.260 --> 00:25:38.090 align:middle line:90%
He's looking around.

00:25:38.090 --> 00:25:39.830 align:middle line:90%
"Zeke."

00:25:39.830 --> 00:25:41.810 align:middle line:90%
Zeke says, who is this?

00:25:41.810 --> 00:25:43.760 align:middle line:90%
"Zeke, this is God."

00:25:43.760 --> 00:25:45.020 align:middle line:90%
This is God?

00:25:45.020 --> 00:25:48.800 align:middle line:84%
"Zeke, I want you to do
healing work with me."

00:25:48.800 --> 00:25:50.030 align:middle line:90%
I'm not a healer, I'm a--

00:25:50.030 --> 00:25:52.430 align:middle line:90%
"Zeke, healing work."

00:25:52.430 --> 00:25:54.260 align:middle line:90%
Zeke gets off his tractor.

00:25:54.260 --> 00:25:56.450 align:middle line:90%
He goes into his nearest town.

00:25:56.450 --> 00:25:59.880 align:middle line:84%
He goes to the
metaphysical bookstore.

00:25:59.880 --> 00:26:00.680 align:middle line:90%
Where do I go?

00:26:00.680 --> 00:26:01.810 align:middle line:90%
I heard the voice of God.

00:26:01.810 --> 00:26:03.360 align:middle line:84%
You need to go over
to this church.

00:26:03.360 --> 00:26:06.740 align:middle line:84%
So he goes over to the
church, tells them this story.

00:26:06.740 --> 00:26:08.720 align:middle line:84%
Oh my god, they're
falling all over him.

00:26:08.720 --> 00:26:10.370 align:middle line:90%
Oh my, you've heard from God.

00:26:10.370 --> 00:26:12.390 align:middle line:84%
So they teach him all
the secrets of healing.

00:26:12.390 --> 00:26:13.190 align:middle line:90%
You do this.

00:26:13.190 --> 00:26:13.990 align:middle line:90%
You do that.

00:26:13.990 --> 00:26:15.500 align:middle line:90%
You lay your hands on.

00:26:15.500 --> 00:26:17.090 align:middle line:90%
Zeke's finally ready.

00:26:17.090 --> 00:26:18.920 align:middle line:90%
A woman walks into the church.

00:26:18.920 --> 00:26:21.470 align:middle line:90%
She's got an arthritic elbow.

00:26:21.470 --> 00:26:26.060 align:middle line:84%
Zeke springs into action,
puts his hands on her elbow.

00:26:26.060 --> 00:26:28.520 align:middle line:90%
She drops dead in the church.

00:26:28.520 --> 00:26:29.630 align:middle line:90%
Zeke looks.

00:26:29.630 --> 00:26:31.580 align:middle line:90%
The congregation looks.

00:26:31.580 --> 00:26:34.700 align:middle line:84%
Next scene, Zeke's
on his tractor.

00:26:34.700 --> 00:26:36.740 align:middle line:90%
"Zeke.

00:26:36.740 --> 00:26:38.210 align:middle line:90%
Zeke."

00:26:38.210 --> 00:26:39.710 align:middle line:90%
God, I did what you said.

00:26:39.710 --> 00:26:41.840 align:middle line:90%
God says, no, Zeke.

00:26:41.840 --> 00:26:44.000 align:middle line:90%
You were to lay your hands on.

00:26:44.000 --> 00:26:45.990 align:middle line:90%
I do the healing.

00:26:45.990 --> 00:26:47.460 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:26:47.460 --> 00:26:50.040 align:middle line:84%
And that's the thing, to allow
that power to flow through.

00:26:50.040 --> 00:26:52.310 align:middle line:84%
And you're not responsible
and you can't take credit.

00:26:52.310 --> 00:26:53.300 align:middle line:90%
>>ROSS: Exactly.

00:26:53.300 --> 00:26:56.720 align:middle line:84%
And there's some people,
they don't want to be healed.

00:26:56.720 --> 00:26:57.960 align:middle line:90%
They may say it.

00:26:57.960 --> 00:26:59.630 align:middle line:90%
They don't want to be healed.

00:26:59.630 --> 00:27:02.060 align:middle line:84%
They're not supposed
to be healed.

00:27:02.060 --> 00:27:06.260 align:middle line:84%
It is part of what they have
come in with to experience

00:27:06.260 --> 00:27:08.070 align:middle line:90%
in the schoolroom of life.

00:27:08.070 --> 00:27:11.000 align:middle line:84%
So once the pressure
was removed,

00:27:11.000 --> 00:27:12.795 align:middle line:90%
it actually was better for me.

00:27:12.795 --> 00:27:13.670 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: OK, Steven.

00:27:13.670 --> 00:27:17.990 align:middle line:84%
So as much as you can explain
it, because it actually

00:27:17.990 --> 00:27:21.920 align:middle line:84%
is quite simple, explain
how this kind of healing

00:27:21.920 --> 00:27:26.270 align:middle line:84%
mechanically is transferring
into a human being whose

00:27:26.270 --> 00:27:28.790 align:middle line:90%
soul is open to being healed.

00:27:28.790 --> 00:27:30.950 align:middle line:84%
And like you just said,
that's the real key.

00:27:30.950 --> 00:27:32.633 align:middle line:84%
You have to be open
to being healed.

00:27:32.633 --> 00:27:34.550 align:middle line:84%
Some people have such a
story in their illness

00:27:34.550 --> 00:27:36.762 align:middle line:84%
that they're attached
to that, and that chip

00:27:36.762 --> 00:27:37.970 align:middle line:90%
will go down with that story.

00:27:37.970 --> 00:27:39.860 align:middle line:84%
>>ROSS: But a lot
of the people, let's

00:27:39.860 --> 00:27:43.460 align:middle line:84%
look at the woman who came to me
with an inoperable brain cancer

00:27:43.460 --> 00:27:44.590 align:middle line:90%
tumor.

00:27:44.590 --> 00:27:49.790 align:middle line:84%
I have had a group come to
me eight people who said,

00:27:49.790 --> 00:27:52.310 align:middle line:84%
would you give us a
little mini presentation?

00:27:52.310 --> 00:27:55.040 align:middle line:84%
One of them heard me
speak at a big hall.

00:27:55.040 --> 00:27:57.500 align:middle line:84%
And I said, sure,
because again, I

00:27:57.500 --> 00:28:00.690 align:middle line:84%
was talking to even birds
on a bench at that time.

00:28:00.690 --> 00:28:02.780 align:middle line:90%
So six people, no problem.

00:28:02.780 --> 00:28:04.040 align:middle line:90%
You come to my office.

00:28:04.040 --> 00:28:05.930 align:middle line:90%
And they came with beach chairs.

00:28:05.930 --> 00:28:07.740 align:middle line:90%
I had a carpet in there.

00:28:07.740 --> 00:28:12.090 align:middle line:84%
And we spoke from 10
o'clock till 4:00.

00:28:12.090 --> 00:28:15.470 align:middle line:84%
And after it was over,
two women came up to me.

00:28:15.470 --> 00:28:19.280 align:middle line:84%
One woman looks at me and
says, I have a problem.

00:28:19.280 --> 00:28:21.170 align:middle line:90%
I said, oh?

00:28:21.170 --> 00:28:22.580 align:middle line:90%
I said, what is that?

00:28:22.580 --> 00:28:27.320 align:middle line:84%
She said, I have been
examined at UCLA.

00:28:27.320 --> 00:28:30.080 align:middle line:84%
I have an inoperable
brain cancer tumor,

00:28:30.080 --> 00:28:31.700 align:middle line:90%
and I think you can help me.

00:28:31.700 --> 00:28:34.370 align:middle line:84%
So I said, well, why do
you think I could help you?

00:28:34.370 --> 00:28:35.990 align:middle line:90%
I looked into your eyes.

00:28:35.990 --> 00:28:37.820 align:middle line:90%
I listened to you talk.

00:28:37.820 --> 00:28:40.680 align:middle line:84%
I believe that
you could heal me.

00:28:40.680 --> 00:28:43.760 align:middle line:84%
So here's the first
part, the belief

00:28:43.760 --> 00:28:45.260 align:middle line:90%
that I could do something.

00:28:45.260 --> 00:28:50.960 align:middle line:84%
So I said to her, if you could
lay down on the floor here.

00:28:50.960 --> 00:28:55.460 align:middle line:84%
And I looked at her friend and
I said, let's heal her together.

00:28:55.460 --> 00:28:56.580 align:middle line:90%
I'm not a healer.

00:28:56.580 --> 00:28:58.550 align:middle line:90%
I said, do you love your friend?

00:28:58.550 --> 00:28:59.510 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

00:28:59.510 --> 00:29:04.460 align:middle line:84%
So we sat on each side of her
head, and I asked the woman,

00:29:04.460 --> 00:29:06.230 align:middle line:90%
could I touch you?

00:29:06.230 --> 00:29:07.490 align:middle line:90%
She said, OK.

00:29:07.490 --> 00:29:12.920 align:middle line:84%
So I took my finger, and I
tapped the top of her head

00:29:12.920 --> 00:29:16.040 align:middle line:90%
and said, that was it.

00:29:16.040 --> 00:29:16.970 align:middle line:90%
She goes back.

00:29:16.970 --> 00:29:17.870 align:middle line:90%
She goes, that's it?

00:29:17.870 --> 00:29:19.790 align:middle line:90%
I said, yes, that's it.

00:29:19.790 --> 00:29:22.280 align:middle line:90%
So she went back to UCLA.

00:29:22.280 --> 00:29:26.130 align:middle line:84%
I have the card that she
sent, because sometimes these

00:29:26.130 --> 00:29:29.810 align:middle line:84%
are hard to believe for
people, where she went back

00:29:29.810 --> 00:29:31.100 align:middle line:90%
and they examined her.

00:29:31.100 --> 00:29:35.570 align:middle line:10%
And they could not find any
trace at all of the same tumor

00:29:35.570 --> 00:29:37.670 align:middle line:10%
that they had originally found.

00:29:37.670 --> 00:29:42.170 align:middle line:84%
So it begins with a
faith that somebody

00:29:42.170 --> 00:29:44.300 align:middle line:90%
is going to do something.

00:29:44.300 --> 00:29:46.370 align:middle line:84%
The greatest
healers are the ones

00:29:46.370 --> 00:29:51.590 align:middle line:84%
who can provide the greatest
environment of expectation

00:29:51.590 --> 00:29:53.210 align:middle line:84%
that something is
going to happen.

00:29:53.210 --> 00:29:55.130 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Thus, the
faith healing tents.

00:29:55.130 --> 00:29:56.300 align:middle line:90%
>>ROSS: Exactly.

00:29:56.300 --> 00:30:00.320 align:middle line:84%
And so that is why
things do happen there.

00:30:00.320 --> 00:30:06.290 align:middle line:10%
What I do is, every single
person is completely different,

00:30:06.290 --> 00:30:09.500 align:middle line:10%
but the one
similarity I have is I

00:30:09.500 --> 00:30:15.320 align:middle line:10%
see them in a perfect
condition for one nanosecond.

00:30:15.320 --> 00:30:17.910 align:middle line:84%
If they say they have a
problem, I go, whoa, whoa, whoa,

00:30:17.910 --> 00:30:21.520 align:middle line:84%
you don't necessarily
need to tell me.

00:30:21.520 --> 00:30:25.140 align:middle line:84%
I am going to see you
not how you see yourself,

00:30:25.140 --> 00:30:29.010 align:middle line:84%
but I see you in
perfect condition.

00:30:29.010 --> 00:30:32.190 align:middle line:84%
I see you running and
jumping if you're confined

00:30:32.190 --> 00:30:34.050 align:middle line:90%
with some kind of leg problem.

00:30:34.050 --> 00:30:39.190 align:middle line:84%
I see you singing your heart out
if you have a throat condition.

00:30:39.190 --> 00:30:42.270 align:middle line:84%
Whatever it happens
to be, I want

00:30:42.270 --> 00:30:44.500 align:middle line:84%
to see that person
in total perfection.

00:30:44.500 --> 00:30:47.040 align:middle line:84%
And if they're with me,
I say, why don't you

00:30:47.040 --> 00:30:48.960 align:middle line:90%
go on a journey with me?

00:30:48.960 --> 00:30:50.680 align:middle line:90%
Where are we going, Steve?

00:30:50.680 --> 00:30:52.620 align:middle line:84%
We are going to when
you were sparked

00:30:52.620 --> 00:30:58.090 align:middle line:84%
into existence, when you were
created in complete perfection.

00:30:58.090 --> 00:31:00.600 align:middle line:90%
Will you travel with me?

00:31:00.600 --> 00:31:01.980 align:middle line:90%
Some people will say, no.

00:31:01.980 --> 00:31:03.930 align:middle line:84%
Well, they're not
hurting enough.

00:31:03.930 --> 00:31:06.690 align:middle line:84%
But the people who
will go with me,

00:31:06.690 --> 00:31:12.990 align:middle line:84%
we go and we try to supplement
their image of disease

00:31:12.990 --> 00:31:20.100 align:middle line:84%
and disharmony with a
picture of perfect balance.

00:31:20.100 --> 00:31:21.700 align:middle line:90%
So I gave you the short version.

00:31:21.700 --> 00:31:22.380 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: And it works.

00:31:22.380 --> 00:31:23.255 align:middle line:90%
>>ROSS: And it works.

00:31:23.255 --> 00:31:24.240 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: And it works.

00:31:24.240 --> 00:31:25.830 align:middle line:90%
And so it comes down to this.

00:31:25.830 --> 00:31:29.610 align:middle line:84%
Always seems to come down to
this whole notion of belief

00:31:29.610 --> 00:31:31.420 align:middle line:90%
in what is possible.

00:31:31.420 --> 00:31:33.090 align:middle line:90%
And that's the hardest part.

00:31:33.090 --> 00:31:35.430 align:middle line:84%
Like I said in the very
beginning of this conversation,

00:31:35.430 --> 00:31:37.930 align:middle line:84%
that's the part that we've been
shaken from since our birth,

00:31:37.930 --> 00:31:41.520 align:middle line:84%
is to have faith in that belief,
but belief that we can do it.

00:31:41.520 --> 00:31:42.930 align:middle line:90%
>>ROSS: And it's programming.

00:31:42.930 --> 00:31:47.230 align:middle line:84%
And I am thankful to you for
this opportunity to share,

00:31:47.230 --> 00:31:51.900 align:middle line:84%
because I believe this
period coming up in the world

00:31:51.900 --> 00:31:57.090 align:middle line:84%
is for individuals to really
have this profoundly placed

00:31:57.090 --> 00:31:58.860 align:middle line:90%
in front of them.

00:31:58.860 --> 00:32:01.050 align:middle line:84%
The gifts of the
spirit, and what

00:32:01.050 --> 00:32:03.840 align:middle line:84%
is truly possible
for human beings,

00:32:03.840 --> 00:32:07.590 align:middle line:84%
and what our mind
has been taught

00:32:07.590 --> 00:32:11.470 align:middle line:84%
believes is the only
thing that can happen.

00:32:11.470 --> 00:32:17.400 align:middle line:84%
We are so conditioned, Regina,
in our mind talk, our minds

00:32:17.400 --> 00:32:21.190 align:middle line:90%
saying that this can't be done.

00:32:21.190 --> 00:32:22.750 align:middle line:90%
This is impossible.

00:32:22.750 --> 00:32:24.780 align:middle line:90%
How can this possibly happen?

00:32:24.780 --> 00:32:27.090 align:middle line:90%
No, I'm not at the right place.

00:32:27.090 --> 00:32:28.470 align:middle line:90%
I'm not good enough.

00:32:28.470 --> 00:32:31.770 align:middle line:84%
But people have to
understand, our mind

00:32:31.770 --> 00:32:35.670 align:middle line:90%
is not who we totally are.

00:32:35.670 --> 00:32:38.750 align:middle line:84%
It comes through
our imagination.

00:32:38.750 --> 00:32:41.550 align:middle line:84%
These spiritual gifts,
the spiritual contact

00:32:41.550 --> 00:32:43.500 align:middle line:90%
does not come through our minds.

00:32:43.500 --> 00:32:47.310 align:middle line:84%
Our mind would have shut that
spiritual contact off long ago

00:32:47.310 --> 00:32:48.900 align:middle line:90%
because it doesn't believe it.

00:32:48.900 --> 00:32:53.220 align:middle line:84%
So it is this period
where we are really

00:32:53.220 --> 00:32:58.440 align:middle line:84%
going to see what, as light
beings, we are capable of.

00:32:58.440 --> 00:33:00.150 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: I'm so
glad to hear that.

00:33:00.150 --> 00:33:02.940 align:middle line:84%
The soul group that
I'm associated with

00:33:02.940 --> 00:33:04.890 align:middle line:84%
and get information
from once was

00:33:04.890 --> 00:33:07.227 align:middle line:84%
saying, and talking
about what we

00:33:07.227 --> 00:33:09.060 align:middle line:84%
call the conscious mind,
which of course, is

00:33:09.060 --> 00:33:10.650 align:middle line:90%
the least conscious part of us.

00:33:10.650 --> 00:33:12.000 align:middle line:90%
The conscious mind.

00:33:12.000 --> 00:33:14.610 align:middle line:84%
They said, this
really is only there

00:33:14.610 --> 00:33:17.970 align:middle line:84%
to keep you from
bumping into things.

00:33:17.970 --> 00:33:18.810 align:middle line:90%
>>ROSS: So true.

00:33:18.810 --> 00:33:20.310 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And they're not
really prone towards humor.

00:33:20.310 --> 00:33:22.980 align:middle line:84%
And I started laughing because
it was a kind of a joke,

00:33:22.980 --> 00:33:24.390 align:middle line:90%
but kind of true.

00:33:24.390 --> 00:33:25.650 align:middle line:90%
And I thought, that is true.

00:33:25.650 --> 00:33:31.290 align:middle line:84%
It is really to be the
faithful executor and servant

00:33:31.290 --> 00:33:34.440 align:middle line:84%
of the spirit and knowledge of
the spirit that comes through

00:33:34.440 --> 00:33:35.880 align:middle line:90%
to inform it.

00:33:35.880 --> 00:33:37.950 align:middle line:84%
And instead, we let
it be programmed

00:33:37.950 --> 00:33:41.370 align:middle line:84%
by kind of every
cheap trick out there

00:33:41.370 --> 00:33:43.320 align:middle line:90%
and think that it's dominant.

00:33:43.320 --> 00:33:44.970 align:middle line:84%
And even more so
in men than women,

00:33:44.970 --> 00:33:48.160 align:middle line:84%
it appears men tend to
rule more by the mind.

00:33:48.160 --> 00:33:50.580 align:middle line:84%
Women can live a little
bit more with the mystery

00:33:50.580 --> 00:33:52.070 align:middle line:90%
of not having to know.

00:33:52.070 --> 00:33:55.380 align:middle line:84%
But this thing of having
to know, having to be right

00:33:55.380 --> 00:33:56.800 align:middle line:90%
thwarts belief and faith.

00:33:56.800 --> 00:33:57.600 align:middle line:90%
>>ROSS: Right.

00:33:57.600 --> 00:34:02.100 align:middle line:84%
In the ancient mystery
schools, imagination

00:34:02.100 --> 00:34:05.820 align:middle line:84%
was the most highly
prized gift that we have.

00:34:05.820 --> 00:34:09.510 align:middle line:84%
Now, through these
centuries, we have

00:34:09.510 --> 00:34:14.159 align:middle line:84%
believed that imagination is
what little kids have and it's

00:34:14.159 --> 00:34:15.310 align:middle line:90%
not true.

00:34:15.310 --> 00:34:20.730 align:middle line:84%
We have convoluted one of
the greatest aspects we have

00:34:20.730 --> 00:34:23.190 align:middle line:90%
as human beings and spirit.

00:34:23.190 --> 00:34:26.190 align:middle line:84%
The imaginative
facility is where

00:34:26.190 --> 00:34:31.860 align:middle line:84%
all of the great inventions come
from, discoveries come from.

00:34:31.860 --> 00:34:33.630 align:middle line:84%
It really doesn't
come from the mind.

00:34:33.630 --> 00:34:36.360 align:middle line:84%
And just so your listeners
will get an idea.

00:34:36.360 --> 00:34:41.909 align:middle line:84%
How many of them have had
some sort of idea come through

00:34:41.909 --> 00:34:43.270 align:middle line:90%
in their imagination?

00:34:43.270 --> 00:34:46.409 align:middle line:84%
They see or they
think of something,

00:34:46.409 --> 00:34:51.100 align:middle line:84%
and then the mind goes,
no, this wouldn't happen

00:34:51.100 --> 00:34:52.260 align:middle line:90%
and it's never going to go.

00:34:52.260 --> 00:34:55.679 align:middle line:84%
Well, if it came
from the mind, it

00:34:55.679 --> 00:34:59.760 align:middle line:84%
would be a little bit more open
if it gave it to you, then all

00:34:59.760 --> 00:35:01.480 align:middle line:90%
of a sudden closing the door.

00:35:01.480 --> 00:35:04.030 align:middle line:84%
This is just a simple
little reality.

00:35:04.030 --> 00:35:09.480 align:middle line:84%
The imagination and the mind
are completely different.

00:35:09.480 --> 00:35:12.900 align:middle line:84%
My journey of more
than 50 years has

00:35:12.900 --> 00:35:17.200 align:middle line:84%
been to listen to the
imaginative side a little bit

00:35:17.200 --> 00:35:19.940 align:middle line:84%
more than the mind
side, but the mind side

00:35:19.940 --> 00:35:22.990 align:middle line:84%
has carried me, exactly
what you're saying,

00:35:22.990 --> 00:35:27.370 align:middle line:90%
from totally walking into walls.

00:35:27.370 --> 00:35:28.440 align:middle line:90%
so it's important.

00:35:28.440 --> 00:35:29.240 align:middle line:90%
I honor.

00:35:29.240 --> 00:35:29.710 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: It is.

00:35:29.710 --> 00:35:32.230 align:middle line:84%
And you know what, I mean, as
much as I know these things

00:35:32.230 --> 00:35:34.090 align:middle line:84%
and I work with these
principles a lot,

00:35:34.090 --> 00:35:36.820 align:middle line:84%
on a day-to-day basis, when
the simple little messages come

00:35:36.820 --> 00:35:39.640 align:middle line:84%
through, I say, I
don't need to do that.

00:35:39.640 --> 00:35:41.650 align:middle line:90%
I did it this morning.

00:35:41.650 --> 00:35:44.800 align:middle line:84%
This is kind of
superficial, but not.

00:35:44.800 --> 00:35:47.950 align:middle line:84%
I was getting ready to leave
and I thought, OK, it's

00:35:47.950 --> 00:35:49.338 align:middle line:90%
cold out, put your gloves on.

00:35:49.338 --> 00:35:51.130 align:middle line:84%
I thought, but I'm only
walking to the car.

00:35:51.130 --> 00:35:52.510 align:middle line:90%
That's really not that far.

00:35:52.510 --> 00:35:54.310 align:middle line:90%
I don't need to put gloves on.

00:35:54.310 --> 00:35:56.495 align:middle line:84%
And so if you don't
put your gloves on,

00:35:56.495 --> 00:35:58.120 align:middle line:84%
you're going to break
some fingernails.

00:35:58.120 --> 00:36:00.760 align:middle line:84%
And I thought, well,
why would that happen?

00:36:00.760 --> 00:36:02.180 align:middle line:90%
Walk out.

00:36:02.180 --> 00:36:04.150 align:middle line:84%
Literally there's
ice on the steps.

00:36:04.150 --> 00:36:06.010 align:middle line:90%
Fell down a few stairs.

00:36:06.010 --> 00:36:07.570 align:middle line:90%
Broke some fingernails.

00:36:07.570 --> 00:36:10.090 align:middle line:84%
They wouldn't have
broken had I not had--

00:36:10.090 --> 00:36:11.600 align:middle line:90%
I'm otherwise I'm fine.

00:36:11.600 --> 00:36:14.080 align:middle line:84%
I pick myself up, but I
broke some fingernails, which

00:36:14.080 --> 00:36:16.510 align:middle line:84%
I otherwise would not have
done had I put the gloves on.

00:36:16.510 --> 00:36:18.385 align:middle line:84%
And it was just giving
me a little head's up.

00:36:18.385 --> 00:36:20.246 align:middle line:84%
I'm OK, but I have
broken fingernails now.

00:36:20.246 --> 00:36:22.930 align:middle line:84%
>>ROSS: And it's a matter
of even trusting that.

00:36:22.930 --> 00:36:23.730 align:middle line:90%
Because--

00:36:23.730 --> 00:36:24.730 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Simple things.

00:36:24.730 --> 00:36:27.170 align:middle line:84%
>>ROSS: --your fingernails
were like my Oscar Mayer Wiener

00:36:27.170 --> 00:36:27.970 align:middle line:90%
example.

00:36:27.970 --> 00:36:29.700 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: It's just a
simple little thing.

00:36:29.700 --> 00:36:30.290 align:middle line:90%
>>ROSS: Exactly.

00:36:30.290 --> 00:36:32.095 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And it's like
my mind overrules it.

00:36:32.095 --> 00:36:33.595 align:middle line:84%
Nah, I've just got
a few feet to go.

00:36:33.595 --> 00:36:34.700 align:middle line:90%
Don't worry about it.

00:36:34.700 --> 00:36:36.400 align:middle line:84%
And I always think,
why do you do that?

00:36:36.400 --> 00:36:38.410 align:middle line:90%
You know how this works.

00:36:38.410 --> 00:36:40.240 align:middle line:84%
And I'll pay attention
to it on issues

00:36:40.240 --> 00:36:43.470 align:middle line:84%
that I deem to be of importance,
but not the little things

00:36:43.470 --> 00:36:44.270 align:middle line:90%
every day.

00:36:44.270 --> 00:36:50.450 align:middle line:84%
Oftentimes, I will ignore them
and think, you ninny muggins.

00:36:50.450 --> 00:36:51.930 align:middle line:84%
>>ROSS: Ninny
muggins-- I like it.

00:36:51.930 --> 00:36:54.040 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: That's from
the movie, "Elf."

00:36:54.040 --> 00:36:55.003 align:middle line:90%
Oh, you ninny muggins.

00:36:55.003 --> 00:36:56.170 align:middle line:90%
I think I'm a ninny muggins.

00:36:56.170 --> 00:36:57.890 align:middle line:84%
Why don't you listen
to it all the time?

00:36:57.890 --> 00:36:58.750 align:middle line:90%
And that's on me.

00:36:58.750 --> 00:37:00.730 align:middle line:84%
But this is exactly what
we're talking about.

00:37:00.730 --> 00:37:04.570 align:middle line:84%
>>ROSS: Well, the more that
your listeners and people

00:37:04.570 --> 00:37:10.270 align:middle line:84%
in the world will start
laying aside their mind,

00:37:10.270 --> 00:37:12.700 align:middle line:84%
the more that's
going to come through

00:37:12.700 --> 00:37:16.270 align:middle line:84%
because the energy that's
being projected onto the earth

00:37:16.270 --> 00:37:17.860 align:middle line:90%
right now.

00:37:17.860 --> 00:37:21.550 align:middle line:84%
This is a preparatory
year, 2019.

00:37:21.550 --> 00:37:24.760 align:middle line:84%
In 2020, you're going
to see a lot of people

00:37:24.760 --> 00:37:29.140 align:middle line:84%
doing very interesting
things beyond the norm.

00:37:29.140 --> 00:37:31.750 align:middle line:84%
But I want everybody
to understand here

00:37:31.750 --> 00:37:38.680 align:middle line:84%
that everybody who is ready,
who is open, has the capability.

00:37:38.680 --> 00:37:40.630 align:middle line:84%
And by the way, I
need to retract back

00:37:40.630 --> 00:37:43.040 align:middle line:84%
to the healing for
your listeners.

00:37:43.040 --> 00:37:47.380 align:middle line:84%
I really am not trying to
solicit letters for healing.

00:37:47.380 --> 00:37:48.180 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:37:48.180 --> 00:37:48.980 align:middle line:90%
No, I know that.

00:37:48.980 --> 00:37:51.070 align:middle line:84%
>>ROSS: My message
the last 10, 15 years

00:37:51.070 --> 00:37:53.890 align:middle line:84%
is that people need to
be doing it on their own

00:37:53.890 --> 00:37:55.360 align:middle line:90%
as much as possible.

00:37:55.360 --> 00:37:58.910 align:middle line:84%
But the more that
individuals open up, the more

00:37:58.910 --> 00:38:06.710 align:middle line:84%
that they transcend the physical
without being too out there,

00:38:06.710 --> 00:38:10.270 align:middle line:84%
the more these abilities are
going to be shining through.

00:38:10.270 --> 00:38:12.590 align:middle line:90%
This is the time on this planet.

00:38:12.590 --> 00:38:13.960 align:middle line:90%
It's going to happen.

00:38:13.960 --> 00:38:17.740 align:middle line:84%
And it doesn't have to be-- you
don't have to join some group.

00:38:17.740 --> 00:38:20.320 align:middle line:84%
You don't have to
buy anybody's book.

00:38:20.320 --> 00:38:23.870 align:middle line:84%
You just have to be
open, willing, and ready.

00:38:23.870 --> 00:38:25.120 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: And make the choice.

00:38:25.120 --> 00:38:27.332 align:middle line:84%
>>ROSS: And make
your choice, exactly.

00:38:27.332 --> 00:38:29.290 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: What is it
that's going to be driving

00:38:29.290 --> 00:38:30.640 align:middle line:90%
the shift in these energies?

00:38:30.640 --> 00:38:32.740 align:middle line:84%
Have you been able
to glean that?

00:38:32.740 --> 00:38:37.090 align:middle line:84%
>>ROSS: It is coming from
the Cosmos, the greater

00:38:37.090 --> 00:38:39.310 align:middle line:90%
hierarchy of energies.

00:38:39.310 --> 00:38:43.390 align:middle line:84%
This planet is, as grand
as we think it is--

00:38:43.390 --> 00:38:47.230 align:middle line:84%
and it's grand for
physical materiality--

00:38:47.230 --> 00:38:49.930 align:middle line:84%
it is behind a lot of
other dimensions in regards

00:38:49.930 --> 00:38:54.250 align:middle line:84%
to what is inside these
physical conveyances, which

00:38:54.250 --> 00:38:58.900 align:middle line:84%
are light beings that don't
utilize any of their gifts.

00:38:58.900 --> 00:39:02.770 align:middle line:10%
I believe for the people who
have read the series by Baird

00:39:02.770 --> 00:39:05.170 align:middle line:10%
Spalding, "The Life and
Teachings of the Masters

00:39:05.170 --> 00:39:06.640 align:middle line:10%
of the Far East"--

00:39:06.640 --> 00:39:08.770 align:middle line:10%
it's a six volume set.

00:39:08.770 --> 00:39:11.590 align:middle line:10%
Start reading volume one
to the middle of volume

00:39:11.590 --> 00:39:15.200 align:middle line:10%
two to what people
are capable of.

00:39:15.200 --> 00:39:17.220 align:middle line:84%
And then, you'll
get a very good idea

00:39:17.220 --> 00:39:22.300 align:middle line:84%
of what can start happening,
as long as people understand

00:39:22.300 --> 00:39:23.320 align:middle line:90%
it can happen.

00:39:23.320 --> 00:39:27.430 align:middle line:84%
Now, I've been fortunate because
I've had so many experiences.

00:39:27.430 --> 00:39:31.930 align:middle line:84%
It's easy for me to talk about
some of these unique things,

00:39:31.930 --> 00:39:35.230 align:middle line:84%
whether it's by location
or the clairaudience

00:39:35.230 --> 00:39:36.790 align:middle line:90%
or the clairvoyance.

00:39:36.790 --> 00:39:41.110 align:middle line:84%
But that is why I am going
to share that with people.

00:39:41.110 --> 00:39:42.580 align:middle line:90%
And I'm going to share.

00:39:42.580 --> 00:39:45.220 align:middle line:90%
No salesman has to call you.

00:39:45.220 --> 00:39:50.050 align:middle line:84%
And you don't have to have
expensive courses or teachers.

00:39:50.050 --> 00:39:53.215 align:middle line:90%
Just be open.

00:39:53.215 --> 00:39:55.840 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And pay attention when
that voice is speaking to you.

00:39:55.840 --> 00:39:56.230 align:middle line:90%
>>ROSS: Yes.

00:39:56.230 --> 00:39:57.030 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:39:57.030 --> 00:39:58.120 align:middle line:90%
Don't ignore it.

00:39:58.120 --> 00:39:58.990 align:middle line:90%
>>ROSS: Exactly.

00:39:58.990 --> 00:40:00.670 align:middle line:90%
No matter how subtle it is.

00:40:00.670 --> 00:40:04.300 align:middle line:90%
Because it's the subtle.

00:40:04.300 --> 00:40:06.790 align:middle line:10%
When we're talking
about dreams, I notice--

00:40:06.790 --> 00:40:11.440 align:middle line:10%
and that's why the book title
"A Grand Design of Dreams"

00:40:11.440 --> 00:40:15.730 align:middle line:10%
is my latest book that I've
co-written with Jeff Wenzel--

00:40:15.730 --> 00:40:18.410 align:middle line:10%
the more you work
with the dreams,

00:40:18.410 --> 00:40:21.800 align:middle line:10%
the more the context of
the dreams start changing.

00:40:21.800 --> 00:40:24.802 align:middle line:84%
And we hopefully
will touch upon that.

00:40:24.802 --> 00:40:26.510 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: We're going
to start right now.

00:40:26.510 --> 00:40:28.172 align:middle line:90%
>>ROSS: Well, you're the best.

00:40:28.172 --> 00:40:28.230 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: OK?

00:40:28.230 --> 00:40:28.470 align:middle line:90%
Thank you.

00:40:28.470 --> 00:40:28.760 align:middle line:90%
>>ROSS: You're the best.

00:40:28.760 --> 00:40:30.720 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Thank you for
guiding me there, Steven.

00:40:30.720 --> 00:40:31.100 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:40:31.100 --> 00:40:32.900 align:middle line:84%
So now we get into
the dreaming part.

00:40:32.900 --> 00:40:35.720 align:middle line:84%
And we may or may not
have time to break it down

00:40:35.720 --> 00:40:38.720 align:middle line:84%
into all the phases, but I think
we can touch on a lot of it.

00:40:38.720 --> 00:40:41.050 align:middle line:84%
But a lot of the information
about your life, where

00:40:41.050 --> 00:40:42.800 align:middle line:84%
you were headed, what
was going to happen,

00:40:42.800 --> 00:40:44.240 align:middle line:90%
came to you through dreams.

00:40:44.240 --> 00:40:48.230 align:middle line:84%
And you were very
dedicated to studying them,

00:40:48.230 --> 00:40:53.580 align:middle line:84%
to chronicling them, and to
be open for the interpretation

00:40:53.580 --> 00:40:54.380 align:middle line:90%
of them.

00:40:54.380 --> 00:40:56.930 align:middle line:84%
Because that, I think, is
the hardest part for people.

00:40:56.930 --> 00:41:01.820 align:middle line:84%
So let's talk about why you
wrote this book and, in terms

00:41:01.820 --> 00:41:04.730 align:middle line:84%
of instruction, what you
hope to impart to people

00:41:04.730 --> 00:41:05.810 align:middle line:90%
for their own journey.

00:41:05.810 --> 00:41:07.760 align:middle line:90%
>>ROSS: OK.

00:41:07.760 --> 00:41:11.000 align:middle line:84%
I was a math science
major, had a background

00:41:11.000 --> 00:41:15.350 align:middle line:84%
in sports, had no contact
with whether we call it

00:41:15.350 --> 00:41:18.380 align:middle line:84%
spirituality,
esoterics, metaphysics.

00:41:18.380 --> 00:41:21.870 align:middle line:10%
And I met a Native American
in a city, North Hollywood,

00:41:21.870 --> 00:41:24.200 align:middle line:10%
California, who said
all my guidance would

00:41:24.200 --> 00:41:25.550 align:middle line:10%
come in my dreams.

00:41:25.550 --> 00:41:28.520 align:middle line:10%
And I remember laughing
and thinking, dreams?

00:41:28.520 --> 00:41:30.750 align:middle line:10%
My dreams are crazy.

00:41:30.750 --> 00:41:33.770 align:middle line:90%
I met him in 1973.

00:41:33.770 --> 00:41:36.000 align:middle line:90%
I was 24 years old.

00:41:36.000 --> 00:41:39.680 align:middle line:84%
And he said, all your future
guidance will come in dreams.

00:41:39.680 --> 00:41:43.070 align:middle line:84%
And I was so excited I went
one week without sleeping.

00:41:43.070 --> 00:41:45.347 align:middle line:84%
Because every night,
I go to sleep going,

00:41:45.347 --> 00:41:46.430 align:middle line:90%
I'm going to have a dream.

00:41:46.430 --> 00:41:48.240 align:middle line:90%
It's going to be real impactful.

00:41:48.240 --> 00:41:51.050 align:middle line:84%
And then, I was up all
night and never had a dream.

00:41:51.050 --> 00:41:54.500 align:middle line:84%
One week later, being
sufficiently exhausted,

00:41:54.500 --> 00:41:59.540 align:middle line:84%
where I was forced into
a dream, I had a dream.

00:41:59.540 --> 00:42:04.250 align:middle line:84%
And the dream was impactful
enough that I followed through

00:42:04.250 --> 00:42:05.660 align:middle line:90%
on that dream.

00:42:05.660 --> 00:42:07.847 align:middle line:90%
Now, I can share it quickly.

00:42:07.847 --> 00:42:08.930 align:middle line:90%
It was a very short dream.

00:42:08.930 --> 00:42:12.170 align:middle line:90%


00:42:12.170 --> 00:42:16.400 align:middle line:84%
I heard a voice say, what
kind of animal is Steve?

00:42:16.400 --> 00:42:18.590 align:middle line:90%
And then a book was opened up.

00:42:18.590 --> 00:42:22.970 align:middle line:84%
A finger pointed to a
picture of an animal.

00:42:22.970 --> 00:42:25.730 align:middle line:84%
But before I tell you
what that animal was,

00:42:25.730 --> 00:42:29.870 align:middle line:84%
I recognized the voice
as a former teammate

00:42:29.870 --> 00:42:33.920 align:middle line:84%
who played six-man volleyball
with me five years earlier.

00:42:33.920 --> 00:42:38.360 align:middle line:84%
And something possessed
me to call him up.

00:42:38.360 --> 00:42:39.170 align:middle line:90%
His name was Bob.

00:42:39.170 --> 00:42:39.970 align:middle line:90%
I called him up.

00:42:39.970 --> 00:42:42.930 align:middle line:84%
I said, Bob, is there anything
bothering you about me?

00:42:42.930 --> 00:42:44.090 align:middle line:90%
No.

00:42:44.090 --> 00:42:46.280 align:middle line:90%
Bob, are you upset with me?

00:42:46.280 --> 00:42:48.020 align:middle line:90%
No.

00:42:48.020 --> 00:42:50.060 align:middle line:90%
Steve, what's your problem?

00:42:50.060 --> 00:42:51.550 align:middle line:90%
I started to get a little shaky.

00:42:51.550 --> 00:42:56.100 align:middle line:84%
I go, Bob is there
anything wrong?

00:42:56.100 --> 00:42:58.820 align:middle line:84%
He says, yes, something
has bothered me.

00:42:58.820 --> 00:43:01.400 align:middle line:90%
Jeez, my stomach was fluttering.

00:43:01.400 --> 00:43:02.240 align:middle line:90%
I said, what?

00:43:02.240 --> 00:43:04.910 align:middle line:84%
He said, do you remember
our six-man team?

00:43:04.910 --> 00:43:06.350 align:middle line:90%
I said, yes.

00:43:06.350 --> 00:43:10.010 align:middle line:84%
Do you remember what you did to
Harold, one of our teammates?

00:43:10.010 --> 00:43:12.080 align:middle line:90%
I said, no.

00:43:12.080 --> 00:43:15.780 align:middle line:84%
He said, Harold was the seventh
man on the six-man team.

00:43:15.780 --> 00:43:19.040 align:middle line:84%
And when he came in
and made a mistake,

00:43:19.040 --> 00:43:21.650 align:middle line:90%
you would glare at him.

00:43:21.650 --> 00:43:23.450 align:middle line:90%
And now, this is Bob talking.

00:43:23.450 --> 00:43:27.020 align:middle line:84%
Bob said to me on the phone,
when Harold and I would go out

00:43:27.020 --> 00:43:29.420 align:middle line:84%
after the game,
he would throw up

00:43:29.420 --> 00:43:32.250 align:middle line:84%
because he couldn't
win your approval.

00:43:32.250 --> 00:43:35.240 align:middle line:84%
And I thought you
were a real hog.

00:43:35.240 --> 00:43:41.230 align:middle line:84%
Now, that finger pointed
to a hog in that book.

00:43:41.230 --> 00:43:45.330 align:middle line:84%
There's no way that I
knew anything about that.

00:43:45.330 --> 00:43:47.630 align:middle line:90%
But I started paying attention.

00:43:47.630 --> 00:43:50.240 align:middle line:84%
And after that, I had
four to six dreams

00:43:50.240 --> 00:43:56.270 align:middle line:84%
every night on every phase of my
personality, night after night.

00:43:56.270 --> 00:43:58.160 align:middle line:90%
But I wouldn't give in.

00:43:58.160 --> 00:44:03.590 align:middle line:84%
And by giving in, mean make
excuses or say, no, this

00:44:03.590 --> 00:44:06.210 align:middle line:90%
can't possibly be me.

00:44:06.210 --> 00:44:09.110 align:middle line:84%
And then, something
else happened.

00:44:09.110 --> 00:44:10.820 align:middle line:90%
I would have the dream.

00:44:10.820 --> 00:44:13.120 align:middle line:84%
I would have a legal
size pad next to me.

00:44:13.120 --> 00:44:15.110 align:middle line:90%
I've got my eyes closed.

00:44:15.110 --> 00:44:17.420 align:middle line:90%
I would write the dream down.

00:44:17.420 --> 00:44:21.530 align:middle line:84%
And then I would get a
complete interpretation right

00:44:21.530 --> 00:44:24.417 align:middle line:90%
after the dream.

00:44:24.417 --> 00:44:26.750 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: It would be literally
streamed through to you.

00:44:26.750 --> 00:44:32.330 align:middle line:84%
>>ROSS: Streamed through to me,
which is why I believe that we

00:44:32.330 --> 00:44:36.710 align:middle line:84%
all have that capability, which
is why we've written the book

00:44:36.710 --> 00:44:41.330 align:middle line:84%
"A Grand Design of Dreams,"
that the more you work with this

00:44:41.330 --> 00:44:45.155 align:middle line:84%
incredible vehicle
that we have--

00:44:45.155 --> 00:44:48.410 align:middle line:90%


00:44:48.410 --> 00:44:49.910 align:middle line:90%
it's unlimited.

00:44:49.910 --> 00:44:53.720 align:middle line:84%
I was given telephone
numbers at night.

00:44:53.720 --> 00:44:56.630 align:middle line:84%
And I would call those
numbers the next morning.

00:44:56.630 --> 00:44:58.440 align:middle line:84%
I was so shy in
those early years.

00:44:58.440 --> 00:45:00.270 align:middle line:84%
It was like, what do
I-- what do I say?

00:45:00.270 --> 00:45:01.700 align:middle line:90%
I just have a telephone number.

00:45:01.700 --> 00:45:03.170 align:middle line:90%
I'm going to ask for Bill.

00:45:03.170 --> 00:45:04.732 align:middle line:90%
How creative of me.

00:45:04.732 --> 00:45:06.170 align:middle line:90%
Hi, is Bill there?

00:45:06.170 --> 00:45:10.080 align:middle line:90%
Steve, we're waiting for you.

00:45:10.080 --> 00:45:11.930 align:middle line:90%
We have something for you.

00:45:11.930 --> 00:45:15.860 align:middle line:84%
And you, of all people,
know this library is filled

00:45:15.860 --> 00:45:17.762 align:middle line:90%
with scrolls and old books--

00:45:17.762 --> 00:45:19.220 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Oh, it's
a magical place.

00:45:19.220 --> 00:45:20.470 align:middle line:90%
>>ROSS: --and ancient healing.

00:45:20.470 --> 00:45:24.560 align:middle line:84%
They have all come through
guidance and dreams.

00:45:24.560 --> 00:45:27.530 align:middle line:90%
Now, am I a lucky guy?

00:45:27.530 --> 00:45:29.390 align:middle line:90%
Am I different?

00:45:29.390 --> 00:45:31.250 align:middle line:90%
No.

00:45:31.250 --> 00:45:33.080 align:middle line:90%
Nike says it right.

00:45:33.080 --> 00:45:34.845 align:middle line:90%
I just did it.

00:45:34.845 --> 00:45:35.720 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: And you do.

00:45:35.720 --> 00:45:36.920 align:middle line:90%
>>ROSS: I just followed it.

00:45:36.920 --> 00:45:37.720 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: You do.

00:45:37.720 --> 00:45:39.810 align:middle line:90%
You put effort into your life.

00:45:39.810 --> 00:45:40.970 align:middle line:90%
You're not a lazy person.

00:45:40.970 --> 00:45:43.568 align:middle line:84%
So this didn't just kind of come
and was dropped at your feet.

00:45:43.568 --> 00:45:45.360 align:middle line:84%
If I was you I would
have dropped the ball.

00:45:45.360 --> 00:45:46.800 align:middle line:84%
>>ROSS: And the sports
background helped.

00:45:46.800 --> 00:45:48.270 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: It did--
the discipline.

00:45:48.270 --> 00:45:49.970 align:middle line:84%
>>ROSS: Exactly,
the discipline part.

00:45:49.970 --> 00:45:50.560 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: And the will.

00:45:50.560 --> 00:45:51.360 align:middle line:90%
>>ROSS: Right.

00:45:51.360 --> 00:45:52.160 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:45:52.160 --> 00:45:52.960 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:45:52.960 --> 00:45:54.740 align:middle line:84%
So let's talk about
another part of dreams

00:45:54.740 --> 00:45:56.390 align:middle line:90%
that I find fascinating.

00:45:56.390 --> 00:45:59.428 align:middle line:84%
And people, often--
they don't even

00:45:59.428 --> 00:46:01.970 align:middle line:84%
know they're trying to discern
the difference, the difference

00:46:01.970 --> 00:46:05.420 align:middle line:84%
between having a dream and
having an actual experience

00:46:05.420 --> 00:46:06.440 align:middle line:90%
in another dimension.

00:46:06.440 --> 00:46:07.885 align:middle line:90%
>>ROSS: Right.

00:46:07.885 --> 00:46:09.260 align:middle line:84%
I think they're
one and the same,

00:46:09.260 --> 00:46:13.046 align:middle line:90%
and they happen all the time.

00:46:13.046 --> 00:46:16.706 align:middle line:84%
You can have four dreams
a night, and two of them

00:46:16.706 --> 00:46:19.760 align:middle line:84%
are going to be
other dimensions.

00:46:19.760 --> 00:46:21.980 align:middle line:84%
You're going to have
guidance dreams.

00:46:21.980 --> 00:46:25.280 align:middle line:84%
You know, this whole
aspect of the higher self--

00:46:25.280 --> 00:46:28.400 align:middle line:84%
and I was reading something
very interesting the other day.

00:46:28.400 --> 00:46:30.320 align:middle line:90%
I can only say I'm reading it.

00:46:30.320 --> 00:46:33.680 align:middle line:84%
I can share experiences
when they're experiences.

00:46:33.680 --> 00:46:39.860 align:middle line:84%
But until I experience it, I
can't say I know it for a fact.

00:46:39.860 --> 00:46:43.820 align:middle line:84%
There is no past,
present, and future.

00:46:43.820 --> 00:46:45.500 align:middle line:90%
It's all simultaneously.

00:46:45.500 --> 00:46:49.580 align:middle line:84%
The higher self is leading
multiple existences,

00:46:49.580 --> 00:46:51.020 align:middle line:90%
multiple lives.

00:46:51.020 --> 00:46:55.155 align:middle line:84%
And it's all being fed
into this higher self.

00:46:55.155 --> 00:46:56.780 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Well, let
me give an example.

00:46:56.780 --> 00:46:59.030 align:middle line:84%
You meet with someone
on the other side,

00:46:59.030 --> 00:47:00.350 align:middle line:90%
maybe someone familiar to you.

00:47:00.350 --> 00:47:02.720 align:middle line:84%
Maybe you have a conversation
or experience with them.

00:47:02.720 --> 00:47:04.250 align:middle line:84%
Of course, they'll call
you the next morning,

00:47:04.250 --> 00:47:05.300 align:middle line:84%
and you'll know that
you were actually

00:47:05.300 --> 00:47:06.950 align:middle line:90%
hooking up with this person.

00:47:06.950 --> 00:47:09.200 align:middle line:84%
And so that's not
a dream, per se.

00:47:09.200 --> 00:47:10.700 align:middle line:84%
It's an experience
where you're just

00:47:10.700 --> 00:47:13.010 align:middle line:84%
connecting on another
dimension with someone.

00:47:13.010 --> 00:47:16.220 align:middle line:84%
And so that's the
differentiating factor

00:47:16.220 --> 00:47:17.840 align:middle line:90%
that I'm talking about--

00:47:17.840 --> 00:47:19.940 align:middle line:90%
experience versus dream.

00:47:19.940 --> 00:47:22.310 align:middle line:84%
Now, you put them kind
of in different places

00:47:22.310 --> 00:47:23.570 align:middle line:90%
in the same wheelhouse?

00:47:23.570 --> 00:47:25.130 align:middle line:90%
>>ROSS: Absolutely.

00:47:25.130 --> 00:47:30.950 align:middle line:84%
I think that we have very little
conception of what this higher

00:47:30.950 --> 00:47:39.260 align:middle line:84%
self, really, the magnitude,
the breath of what it really is.

00:47:39.260 --> 00:47:42.170 align:middle line:84%
And I've had a lot
of spiritual contact.

00:47:42.170 --> 00:47:46.010 align:middle line:84%
I'd like to think I'm balanced
from the standpoint I've

00:47:46.010 --> 00:47:47.540 align:middle line:90%
had classical teaching.

00:47:47.540 --> 00:47:48.710 align:middle line:90%
Both of us have--

00:47:48.710 --> 00:47:51.680 align:middle line:84%
the math, the science,
the physics, the sports.

00:47:51.680 --> 00:47:54.290 align:middle line:84%
But this other world
is just as real to me.

00:47:54.290 --> 00:47:56.870 align:middle line:84%
Because a lot of
experiences we haven't even

00:47:56.870 --> 00:48:00.770 align:middle line:84%
gotten into that
have happened show me

00:48:00.770 --> 00:48:07.160 align:middle line:84%
that there is so much more
going on beyond the veil of what

00:48:07.160 --> 00:48:08.780 align:middle line:90%
we physically see.

00:48:08.780 --> 00:48:11.630 align:middle line:84%
But I have asked a
couple of entities

00:48:11.630 --> 00:48:14.210 align:middle line:84%
that I consider
interesting, what

00:48:14.210 --> 00:48:19.040 align:middle line:84%
is your conception of, quote,
"God" or "higher soul"?

00:48:19.040 --> 00:48:22.340 align:middle line:84%
Even on this other
side, they go,

00:48:22.340 --> 00:48:24.050 align:middle line:90%
it's an even brighter light.

00:48:24.050 --> 00:48:28.010 align:middle line:84%
I mean, nobody really
comprehends here,

00:48:28.010 --> 00:48:33.050 align:middle line:84%
in our linear world, what
is really taking place,

00:48:33.050 --> 00:48:37.490 align:middle line:84%
how everything hangs together,
how many planets there are,

00:48:37.490 --> 00:48:41.720 align:middle line:84%
how if there really is
reincarnation which, obviously,

00:48:41.720 --> 00:48:42.725 align:middle line:90%
I believe very fully--

00:48:42.725 --> 00:48:43.580 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: And I do.

00:48:43.580 --> 00:48:45.320 align:middle line:84%
>>ROSS: --how all of
this has worked out,

00:48:45.320 --> 00:48:50.330 align:middle line:84%
how everything exists, how
everything is intricate.

00:48:50.330 --> 00:48:52.610 align:middle line:90%
It is totally beyond belief.

00:48:52.610 --> 00:48:55.400 align:middle line:84%
And then, there's things
on other planets going on.

00:48:55.400 --> 00:48:57.140 align:middle line:90%
It's gigantic.

00:48:57.140 --> 00:48:59.660 align:middle line:84%
And when you have
people beyond you going,

00:48:59.660 --> 00:49:03.810 align:middle line:84%
it's beyond me, then
I don't even go there.

00:49:03.810 --> 00:49:04.610 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: I agree.

00:49:04.610 --> 00:49:05.750 align:middle line:90%
Yes, I agree with that.

00:49:05.750 --> 00:49:08.510 align:middle line:90%


00:49:08.510 --> 00:49:10.560 align:middle line:84%
You know, we all
have our prejudices.

00:49:10.560 --> 00:49:13.700 align:middle line:84%
And I have a prejudice against
the notion of ascension

00:49:13.700 --> 00:49:16.610 align:middle line:84%
where everyone believes,
in the ascension movement,

00:49:16.610 --> 00:49:19.130 align:middle line:84%
that you're going to ascend
and become something that's

00:49:19.130 --> 00:49:21.500 align:middle line:84%
of a vibrational nature,
and you'll no longer

00:49:21.500 --> 00:49:22.670 align:middle line:90%
be incarnating on Earth.

00:49:22.670 --> 00:49:25.820 align:middle line:84%
And I think there will come a
time, of course, where people

00:49:25.820 --> 00:49:28.640 align:middle line:84%
work their way out of any
given wheel of fortune,

00:49:28.640 --> 00:49:32.390 align:middle line:84%
so to speak, and
into another density.

00:49:32.390 --> 00:49:33.690 align:middle line:90%
I do think that.

00:49:33.690 --> 00:49:38.540 align:middle line:84%
But I think that the notion that
you can follow a course or two

00:49:38.540 --> 00:49:42.080 align:middle line:84%
and ascend in just
one incarnation

00:49:42.080 --> 00:49:44.190 align:middle line:84%
is not a practical
means of thought.

00:49:44.190 --> 00:49:44.990 align:middle line:90%
>>ROSS: I agree.

00:49:44.990 --> 00:49:48.380 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Because first of
all, ascending toward what?

00:49:48.380 --> 00:49:51.770 align:middle line:84%
And so to me, it's more
of a process of knowing

00:49:51.770 --> 00:49:53.330 align:middle line:90%
thyself and refinement.

00:49:53.330 --> 00:49:54.440 align:middle line:90%
>>ROSS: Right.

00:49:54.440 --> 00:49:56.420 align:middle line:84%
Let's look at some of
the ancient teachings

00:49:56.420 --> 00:49:58.370 align:middle line:90%
from the very wise ones.

00:49:58.370 --> 00:49:59.720 align:middle line:90%
As above, so below.

00:49:59.720 --> 00:50:01.440 align:middle line:90%
As below, so above.

00:50:01.440 --> 00:50:04.310 align:middle line:84%
Let's look at the
analogy of a schoolroom.

00:50:04.310 --> 00:50:06.790 align:middle line:84%
In a schoolroom-- let's
take elementary school--

00:50:06.790 --> 00:50:10.100 align:middle line:84%
grade-- in my day,
it was 1 through 6.

00:50:10.100 --> 00:50:12.740 align:middle line:84%
This ascension idea
is the equivalent

00:50:12.740 --> 00:50:17.290 align:middle line:84%
of saying something or somebody
walks in and goes, guess what?

00:50:17.290 --> 00:50:19.970 align:middle line:90%
You are all at college now.

00:50:19.970 --> 00:50:21.560 align:middle line:90%
You are all college students.

00:50:21.560 --> 00:50:23.900 align:middle line:84%
You have immediate and
instant enlightenment.

00:50:23.900 --> 00:50:24.740 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Exactly.

00:50:24.740 --> 00:50:25.655 align:middle line:90%
Perfect example.

00:50:25.655 --> 00:50:26.455 align:middle line:90%
>>ROSS: No.

00:50:26.455 --> 00:50:27.690 align:middle line:90%
That's not going to happen.

00:50:27.690 --> 00:50:30.920 align:middle line:84%
Here's what I personally
believe, myself,

00:50:30.920 --> 00:50:32.810 align:middle line:90%
is going to happen.

00:50:32.810 --> 00:50:37.520 align:middle line:84%
The opportunity
for great expansion

00:50:37.520 --> 00:50:41.960 align:middle line:84%
is going to be more available
than it has been in the past.

00:50:41.960 --> 00:50:43.700 align:middle line:90%
Now, why would that be?

00:50:43.700 --> 00:50:45.890 align:middle line:84%
Because the veil
between the worlds

00:50:45.890 --> 00:50:50.810 align:middle line:84%
is getting thinner, and the
opportunity for individuals

00:50:50.810 --> 00:50:55.410 align:middle line:84%
to experience greater
clairvoyance, all of these

00:50:55.410 --> 00:50:56.210 align:middle line:90%
are here.

00:50:56.210 --> 00:50:57.330 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Greater
connection with higher self.

00:50:57.330 --> 00:50:59.120 align:middle line:84%
>>ROSS: But everybody
is not going

00:50:59.120 --> 00:51:03.950 align:middle line:84%
to transcend, only the ones
who have deemed, in their soul

00:51:03.950 --> 00:51:08.210 align:middle line:84%
journey, in this living, that
they want to experience that.

00:51:08.210 --> 00:51:10.850 align:middle line:84%
Because there'll be other
people on this planet who'll go,

00:51:10.850 --> 00:51:12.680 align:middle line:90%
nah, no, no.

00:51:12.680 --> 00:51:13.943 align:middle line:90%
This can't be.

00:51:13.943 --> 00:51:16.610 align:middle line:84%
This is the most important thing
to me in the world, this money.

00:51:16.610 --> 00:51:19.640 align:middle line:84%
No, the most important
thing to me is power.

00:51:19.640 --> 00:51:24.920 align:middle line:84%
The individuals who will say
the most important thing for me

00:51:24.920 --> 00:51:31.400 align:middle line:84%
is love and beauty, they
won't automatically go,

00:51:31.400 --> 00:51:36.680 align:middle line:84%
but they are already open
to experience the greater

00:51:36.680 --> 00:51:41.720 align:middle line:84%
abilities that their own
inner self possesses.

00:51:41.720 --> 00:51:45.260 align:middle line:84%
You and I and everybody
watching this show and everyone

00:51:45.260 --> 00:51:49.790 align:middle line:84%
not watching this show
has these abilities.

00:51:49.790 --> 00:51:55.220 align:middle line:84%
Once you place yourself in a
way that they can be expressed,

00:51:55.220 --> 00:51:57.650 align:middle line:90%
then you learn it's there.

00:51:57.650 --> 00:52:01.880 align:middle line:84%
That is why people who lock
themselves into one pathway,

00:52:01.880 --> 00:52:05.150 align:middle line:84%
even if it is a
spiritual pathway,

00:52:05.150 --> 00:52:07.550 align:middle line:84%
immediately limit
themselves to what

00:52:07.550 --> 00:52:09.495 align:middle line:90%
that teacher or the students do.

00:52:09.495 --> 00:52:10.370 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Absolutely.

00:52:10.370 --> 00:52:14.540 align:middle line:84%
>>ROSS: The secret is to be as
open and make no boundaries.

00:52:14.540 --> 00:52:15.873 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: I agree with you 100%.

00:52:15.873 --> 00:52:18.560 align:middle line:84%
And for me, the
greatest moments in life

00:52:18.560 --> 00:52:19.850 align:middle line:90%
are the thrill of discovery.

00:52:19.850 --> 00:52:20.790 align:middle line:90%
>>ROSS: Yes.

00:52:20.790 --> 00:52:22.970 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And you can't
discover if you're not open

00:52:22.970 --> 00:52:24.740 align:middle line:90%
and if you're not in the moment.

00:52:24.740 --> 00:52:26.350 align:middle line:90%
It will completely escape you.

00:52:26.350 --> 00:52:29.750 align:middle line:84%
It'll whiz right by, and
you never even smell it.

00:52:29.750 --> 00:52:33.140 align:middle line:84%
And so putting oneself
in that state of wonder

00:52:33.140 --> 00:52:37.880 align:middle line:84%
and what it means to invite
beauty in as your reality--

00:52:37.880 --> 00:52:39.710 align:middle line:84%
and it doesn't mean
having pretty curtains

00:52:39.710 --> 00:52:41.180 align:middle line:90%
and decorative pillows.

00:52:41.180 --> 00:52:44.370 align:middle line:84%
It's a much deeper subject
and one that is so overlooked.

00:52:44.370 --> 00:52:45.170 align:middle line:90%
>>ROSS: Yes.

00:52:45.170 --> 00:52:47.545 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Go ahead and--
because you mentioned this word,

00:52:47.545 --> 00:52:49.100 align:middle line:90%
and people are saying, beauty?

00:52:49.100 --> 00:52:50.960 align:middle line:84%
So explain a little
bit about what

00:52:50.960 --> 00:52:54.680 align:middle line:84%
you mean about inviting love
and beauty in as a baseline.

00:52:54.680 --> 00:52:55.970 align:middle line:90%
>>ROSS: Right.

00:52:55.970 --> 00:52:59.780 align:middle line:84%
The ancient definition of
beauty was lying in harmony.

00:52:59.780 --> 00:53:03.930 align:middle line:84%
Because, of course, you can ask
two people, is that beautiful?

00:53:03.930 --> 00:53:04.730 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:53:04.730 --> 00:53:05.700 align:middle line:90%
Some people say yes.

00:53:05.700 --> 00:53:07.220 align:middle line:90%
Some people say no.

00:53:07.220 --> 00:53:12.170 align:middle line:84%
It has to do with an
individual feeling

00:53:12.170 --> 00:53:17.450 align:middle line:84%
that something they're looking
at is harmonious to their soul.

00:53:17.450 --> 00:53:21.860 align:middle line:84%
And if it is, they're going to
say, wow, that is beautiful.

00:53:21.860 --> 00:53:23.720 align:middle line:84%
Now, you, I, or
some other people

00:53:23.720 --> 00:53:27.830 align:middle line:84%
may look at exactly the
same thing and go, ah, no,

00:53:27.830 --> 00:53:29.420 align:middle line:90%
that doesn't strike me well.

00:53:29.420 --> 00:53:32.360 align:middle line:84%
Maybe we like triangles
instead of circles

00:53:32.360 --> 00:53:35.240 align:middle line:90%
or tic-tac-toe squares.

00:53:35.240 --> 00:53:37.590 align:middle line:84%
There is something
that resonates.

00:53:37.590 --> 00:53:39.710 align:middle line:84%
So when we speak
about beauty, it

00:53:39.710 --> 00:53:45.620 align:middle line:84%
is about getting in alignment
with what your own soul

00:53:45.620 --> 00:53:48.000 align:middle line:90%
believes is beautiful.

00:53:48.000 --> 00:53:51.540 align:middle line:84%
And when you have this
beauty around you,

00:53:51.540 --> 00:53:54.020 align:middle line:90%
you can't help but act beauty.

00:53:54.020 --> 00:53:57.170 align:middle line:84%
The ancients say if you
don't have beauty within you,

00:53:57.170 --> 00:53:59.450 align:middle line:84%
you cannot appreciate
it outward.

00:53:59.450 --> 00:54:02.390 align:middle line:84%
And the people who deface
different properties

00:54:02.390 --> 00:54:07.160 align:middle line:84%
or destroy, the only reason
they are able to do that is they

00:54:07.160 --> 00:54:10.890 align:middle line:84%
don't have this inner
feeling of beauty.

00:54:10.890 --> 00:54:16.910 align:middle line:84%
Now, beauty and love, in my
parlance are very, very close.

00:54:16.910 --> 00:54:17.870 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes, I agree.

00:54:17.870 --> 00:54:20.840 align:middle line:84%
>>ROSS: Because it's very
hard to separate that.

00:54:20.840 --> 00:54:24.800 align:middle line:84%
And by gosh, there's been so
many presentations on what

00:54:24.800 --> 00:54:27.680 align:middle line:84%
people think is love, going
all the way back, even

00:54:27.680 --> 00:54:30.050 align:middle line:90%
before Plato and love.

00:54:30.050 --> 00:54:36.380 align:middle line:84%
But for me, it has to do with
the more that you build--

00:54:36.380 --> 00:54:37.950 align:middle line:90%
let me rephrase that.

00:54:37.950 --> 00:54:42.320 align:middle line:84%
The more that you assume
everything is beautiful,

00:54:42.320 --> 00:54:46.130 align:middle line:84%
the more the world
becomes beautiful.

00:54:46.130 --> 00:54:49.130 align:middle line:84%
When I was at the airport
waiting to come over,

00:54:49.130 --> 00:54:52.650 align:middle line:84%
and when I fly back, I
love looking at people.

00:54:52.650 --> 00:54:56.090 align:middle line:84%
And I remember my old days
and a little bit more.

00:54:56.090 --> 00:54:58.908 align:middle line:84%
As soon as I would see somebody,
my mind sprang into action.

00:54:58.908 --> 00:55:00.200 align:middle line:90%
Oh, that person's got a tattoo.

00:55:00.200 --> 00:55:00.660 align:middle line:90%
They're bad.

00:55:00.660 --> 00:55:01.820 align:middle line:90%
Oh, that person's got long hair.

00:55:01.820 --> 00:55:02.737 align:middle line:90%
Oh, this person's fat.

00:55:02.737 --> 00:55:03.950 align:middle line:90%
This person's that.

00:55:03.950 --> 00:55:08.848 align:middle line:84%
The mind immediately started
looking at one element--

00:55:08.848 --> 00:55:09.890 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: And judging it.

00:55:09.890 --> 00:55:10.940 align:middle line:90%
>>ROSS: And judging it.

00:55:10.940 --> 00:55:12.350 align:middle line:90%
And that is the thing.

00:55:12.350 --> 00:55:14.270 align:middle line:84%
When you start
opening up-- not you--

00:55:14.270 --> 00:55:17.390 align:middle line:84%
but one starts opening up--
because you're already there--

00:55:17.390 --> 00:55:22.460 align:middle line:84%
when one starts opening
up and appreciating

00:55:22.460 --> 00:55:26.690 align:middle line:84%
each individual for who they
are, how unique they are,

00:55:26.690 --> 00:55:28.400 align:middle line:90%
they become beautiful.

00:55:28.400 --> 00:55:30.800 align:middle line:84%
And the more
beautiful they become,

00:55:30.800 --> 00:55:34.010 align:middle line:84%
the harder it is
for the person who

00:55:34.010 --> 00:55:39.070 align:middle line:84%
is looking on beauty to act
any other way but beautiful.

00:55:39.070 --> 00:55:40.070 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Which is love.

00:55:40.070 --> 00:55:40.750 align:middle line:90%
>>ROSS: And that is love.

00:55:40.750 --> 00:55:41.708 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: That is love.

00:55:41.708 --> 00:55:44.120 align:middle line:84%
>>ROSS: And the universal
love, conversely,

00:55:44.120 --> 00:55:47.840 align:middle line:84%
means you are not judging
every single person you look

00:55:47.840 --> 00:55:51.530 align:middle line:90%
at as lovely and beautiful.

00:55:51.530 --> 00:55:54.630 align:middle line:84%
It takes a little bit of
work at the beginning,

00:55:54.630 --> 00:55:56.460 align:middle line:90%
but it's not impossible.

00:55:56.460 --> 00:55:57.980 align:middle line:84%
Again, I'm going
to use my phrase.

00:55:57.980 --> 00:56:00.680 align:middle line:90%
No salesman needs to call.

00:56:00.680 --> 00:56:02.000 align:middle line:90%
You don't need courses.

00:56:02.000 --> 00:56:03.920 align:middle line:84%
There's some great
books written.

00:56:03.920 --> 00:56:06.210 align:middle line:90%
I've got about 20,000 of them.

00:56:06.210 --> 00:56:10.700 align:middle line:84%
But it can be done by an
individual who just listens

00:56:10.700 --> 00:56:14.030 align:middle line:84%
to the segment, goes
out, and listens

00:56:14.030 --> 00:56:16.400 align:middle line:84%
to their mind the
first time, and they're

00:56:16.400 --> 00:56:18.588 align:middle line:84%
going to see exactly
what we're talking about.

00:56:18.588 --> 00:56:19.880 align:middle line:90%
They're going to see something.

00:56:19.880 --> 00:56:22.520 align:middle line:84%
They're going to
come up with it.

00:56:22.520 --> 00:56:25.280 align:middle line:84%
You stop, and you
go, whoa, whoa, whoa.

00:56:25.280 --> 00:56:26.990 align:middle line:90%
Why did I just do that?

00:56:26.990 --> 00:56:29.900 align:middle line:84%
What was the reason
that I bought into that?

00:56:29.900 --> 00:56:33.910 align:middle line:84%
I'm going to start using a
little bit more love, going

00:56:33.910 --> 00:56:36.230 align:middle line:84%
to look at things a
little bit more in beauty.

00:56:36.230 --> 00:56:39.950 align:middle line:84%
So in that area,
that is my belief.

00:56:39.950 --> 00:56:44.010 align:middle line:84%
It doesn't have to be
anything spectacular.

00:56:44.010 --> 00:56:47.660 align:middle line:84%
But I would advise an
individual to have--

00:56:47.660 --> 00:56:51.103 align:middle line:84%
I have a complete
room of beauty.

00:56:51.103 --> 00:56:52.520 align:middle line:84%
It was patterned
after rooms built

00:56:52.520 --> 00:56:56.480 align:middle line:84%
during the Renaissance called
studiolos built by Isabella

00:56:56.480 --> 00:56:59.510 align:middle line:90%
d'Este in the late 1400s.

00:56:59.510 --> 00:57:02.090 align:middle line:84%
You immerse yourself
in total beauty.

00:57:02.090 --> 00:57:04.940 align:middle line:90%
Well, not everybody can do that.

00:57:04.940 --> 00:57:07.230 align:middle line:84%
I have a big mortgage
from doing that.

00:57:07.230 --> 00:57:09.350 align:middle line:90%
But you can have a nice chair.

00:57:09.350 --> 00:57:11.480 align:middle line:90%
Have a beautiful picture there.

00:57:11.480 --> 00:57:13.070 align:middle line:90%
Have a nice statue.

00:57:13.070 --> 00:57:18.110 align:middle line:84%
Spend just a little bit
more, so it has some value.

00:57:18.110 --> 00:57:20.280 align:middle line:84%
And that will start
this journey to beauty.

00:57:20.280 --> 00:57:21.080 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:57:21.080 --> 00:57:23.210 align:middle line:84%
And the thing is what
you said is so important.

00:57:23.210 --> 00:57:26.510 align:middle line:84%
You cannot judge another
person's resonance

00:57:26.510 --> 00:57:28.250 align:middle line:90%
and their path to beauty.

00:57:28.250 --> 00:57:32.330 align:middle line:84%
And I remember my soul group
telling me one time about this

00:57:32.330 --> 00:57:34.850 align:middle line:84%
and saying, what
you find beautiful--

00:57:34.850 --> 00:57:37.130 align:middle line:90%
we were talking about music--

00:57:37.130 --> 00:57:39.260 align:middle line:84%
and what actually
heals and resonates

00:57:39.260 --> 00:57:41.480 align:middle line:84%
with you can be quite
the opposite of the sound

00:57:41.480 --> 00:57:44.390 align:middle line:84%
you'll hear from, say, for
example, a teenage boy.

00:57:44.390 --> 00:57:47.660 align:middle line:84%
His being is growing
in a way that he

00:57:47.660 --> 00:57:49.550 align:middle line:84%
needs what I would
consider to be really

00:57:49.550 --> 00:57:51.410 align:middle line:90%
harsh and metallic in the day.

00:57:51.410 --> 00:57:54.320 align:middle line:84%
Those frequencies
are needed for him

00:57:54.320 --> 00:57:56.300 align:middle line:84%
to create what he's
trying to create

00:57:56.300 --> 00:57:59.120 align:middle line:84%
of his own strength and his
own direction in his being.

00:57:59.120 --> 00:58:01.400 align:middle line:90%
And to him, this is beauty.

00:58:01.400 --> 00:58:02.960 align:middle line:90%
And this is in resonance.

00:58:02.960 --> 00:58:04.880 align:middle line:84%
And it is leading
toward growth, even

00:58:04.880 --> 00:58:08.810 align:middle line:84%
if it's maybe destructive
to my brain patterns, right?

00:58:08.810 --> 00:58:10.880 align:middle line:84%
And as you say, when
you're looking at someone--

00:58:10.880 --> 00:58:13.850 align:middle line:84%
you were judging someone for
being overweight or having

00:58:13.850 --> 00:58:15.660 align:middle line:90%
certain tattoos or so forth--

00:58:15.660 --> 00:58:16.880 align:middle line:90%
and I agree with you.

00:58:16.880 --> 00:58:20.600 align:middle line:84%
Because if I find myself doing
that, I just stop and say,

00:58:20.600 --> 00:58:22.410 align:middle line:84%
this means something
to this person.

00:58:22.410 --> 00:58:24.710 align:middle line:84%
>>ROSS: And that is coming
from your higher self,

00:58:24.710 --> 00:58:27.350 align:middle line:90%
superseding the mind.

00:58:27.350 --> 00:58:30.020 align:middle line:90%
That was our discussion earlier.

00:58:30.020 --> 00:58:31.160 align:middle line:90%
Exactly.

00:58:31.160 --> 00:58:33.890 align:middle line:84%
Old saying-- best not
judge an individual

00:58:33.890 --> 00:58:37.940 align:middle line:84%
till you've walked a moon or two
in that individual's moccasins.

00:58:37.940 --> 00:58:39.810 align:middle line:84%
That's exactly where
that saying comes from.

00:58:39.810 --> 00:58:41.935 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: It's all what
it's about is understanding

00:58:41.935 --> 00:58:43.940 align:middle line:90%
and respecting their journey.

00:58:43.940 --> 00:58:45.670 align:middle line:84%
And these tattoos
are very beautiful.

00:58:45.670 --> 00:58:46.670 align:middle line:90%
And they're a statement.

00:58:46.670 --> 00:58:49.920 align:middle line:84%
And they're committed to these
expressions in their life.

00:58:49.920 --> 00:58:51.197 align:middle line:90%
And so it's beautiful.

00:58:51.197 --> 00:58:52.780 align:middle line:84%
And so I couldn't
agree with you more.

00:58:52.780 --> 00:58:55.070 align:middle line:84%
It's just a little
tweak in the head.

00:58:55.070 --> 00:58:57.800 align:middle line:84%
And so, meanwhile, we're
having a lot of fun,

00:58:57.800 --> 00:59:00.050 align:middle line:84%
and we're running out of
time as a result of that.

00:59:00.050 --> 00:59:01.790 align:middle line:84%
And we got to some of
the dreaming parts.

00:59:01.790 --> 00:59:04.580 align:middle line:84%
But just one final thought
on dreaming that everyone

00:59:04.580 --> 00:59:07.070 align:middle line:84%
can take away from
this before they read

00:59:07.070 --> 00:59:09.320 align:middle line:90%
your book down the road here.

00:59:09.320 --> 00:59:14.690 align:middle line:84%
>>ROSS: I would say, again, that
while individuals have dreams

00:59:14.690 --> 00:59:20.002 align:middle line:84%
that appear to be a certain
way, even after all these years

00:59:20.002 --> 00:59:21.710 align:middle line:84%
where I've worked with
dreams, of course,

00:59:21.710 --> 00:59:24.800 align:middle line:84%
I have those same
type of dreams.

00:59:24.800 --> 00:59:25.730 align:middle line:90%
It is a message.

00:59:25.730 --> 00:59:31.640 align:middle line:84%
It is a direct message
from our higher self to us.

00:59:31.640 --> 00:59:35.210 align:middle line:84%
And the more one pays
attention, what I noticed,

00:59:35.210 --> 00:59:38.000 align:middle line:84%
and what my co-author
and I wrote about,

00:59:38.000 --> 00:59:42.050 align:middle line:84%
was rather than just
looking at one dream

00:59:42.050 --> 00:59:44.120 align:middle line:84%
and trying to
analyze it, I started

00:59:44.120 --> 00:59:46.970 align:middle line:84%
putting them into categories
from over the years.

00:59:46.970 --> 00:59:51.320 align:middle line:84%
And I noticed, oh, my gosh,
I've had 20 dreams on happiness,

00:59:51.320 --> 00:59:54.830 align:middle line:84%
how to have more joy,
spiritual topics.

00:59:54.830 --> 00:59:57.270 align:middle line:84%
And that's what
went into the book.

00:59:57.270 --> 01:00:01.920 align:middle line:84%
The book title is "A
Grand Design of Dreams,"

01:00:01.920 --> 01:00:09.110 align:middle line:84%
and it is not going to tell the
people how exactly to do it.

01:00:09.110 --> 01:00:12.170 align:middle line:84%
It is telling people just
to pay attention to it.

01:00:12.170 --> 01:00:16.810 align:middle line:84%
That is my message, just
to stop, look, and listen,

01:00:16.810 --> 01:00:19.310 align:middle line:84%
to pay attention
to the guidance,

01:00:19.310 --> 01:00:21.410 align:middle line:90%
to listen to that inner voice.

01:00:21.410 --> 01:00:23.520 align:middle line:84%
And I don't know how
much time we have.

01:00:23.520 --> 01:00:24.320 align:middle line:90%
One minute?

01:00:24.320 --> 01:00:25.195 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: One minute.

01:00:25.195 --> 01:00:26.660 align:middle line:90%
>>ROSS: We have one minute.

01:00:26.660 --> 01:00:28.457 align:middle line:84%
I was going to tell
a very quick story.

01:00:28.457 --> 01:00:29.540 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Tell it quickly.

01:00:29.540 --> 01:00:30.340 align:middle line:90%
>>ROSS: OK.

01:00:30.340 --> 01:00:32.540 align:middle line:90%
A man woke up.

01:00:32.540 --> 01:00:34.100 align:middle line:90%
He had had a dream.

01:00:34.100 --> 01:00:36.800 align:middle line:84%
And the dream said, you've
got to be more spiritual.

01:00:36.800 --> 01:00:38.150 align:middle line:90%
So he was a businessman.

01:00:38.150 --> 01:00:40.370 align:middle line:84%
He went down to his
local bookstore,

01:00:40.370 --> 01:00:44.480 align:middle line:84%
and they said the secret is
in the Himalayas in Tibet.

01:00:44.480 --> 01:00:48.200 align:middle line:84%
So he immediately
flies over to Tibet,

01:00:48.200 --> 01:00:50.570 align:middle line:84%
and he starts climbing
up the mountains

01:00:50.570 --> 01:00:53.610 align:middle line:84%
to meet the yogis in
the high mountains.

01:00:53.610 --> 01:00:55.850 align:middle line:90%
He wasn't dressed properly.

01:00:55.850 --> 01:00:57.200 align:middle line:90%
He falls in the snow.

01:00:57.200 --> 01:00:58.850 align:middle line:90%
He's unconscious.

01:00:58.850 --> 01:01:00.710 align:middle line:90%
The yogis are there.

01:01:00.710 --> 01:01:01.620 align:middle line:90%
They heat him up.

01:01:01.620 --> 01:01:02.660 align:middle line:90%
What are you doing here?

01:01:02.660 --> 01:01:05.090 align:middle line:84%
I've come for the
secret of the ages.

01:01:05.090 --> 01:01:07.050 align:middle line:10%
Have I come to the right place?

01:01:07.050 --> 01:01:07.850 align:middle line:10%
No.

01:01:07.850 --> 01:01:09.020 align:middle line:10%
No?

01:01:09.020 --> 01:01:10.820 align:middle line:10%
Well, where's the right place?

01:01:10.820 --> 01:01:12.440 align:middle line:90%
Where did you come from?

01:01:12.440 --> 01:01:16.010 align:middle line:84%
I came from whatever
your city is.

01:01:16.010 --> 01:01:19.910 align:middle line:84%
They said, the answer is
your city where you are.

01:01:19.910 --> 01:01:23.720 align:middle line:84%
Because the answer's always
with you and not outside.

01:01:23.720 --> 01:01:24.970 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Absolutely.

01:01:24.970 --> 01:01:26.210 align:middle line:90%
And finally, LEFL.

01:01:26.210 --> 01:01:27.920 align:middle line:84%
Because we always
have to end with LEFL.

01:01:27.920 --> 01:01:29.420 align:middle line:84%
Because that's your
life philosophy.

01:01:29.420 --> 01:01:31.460 align:middle line:10%
>>ROSS: My life
philosophy is LEFL--

01:01:31.460 --> 01:01:35.420 align:middle line:10%
laughter, excitement,
fun, and love.

01:01:35.420 --> 01:01:37.550 align:middle line:10%
And when people come
to me for counseling,

01:01:37.550 --> 01:01:39.190 align:middle line:10%
I check their LEFLometer.

01:01:39.190 --> 01:01:40.790 align:middle line:84%
When was the last
time you laughed?

01:01:40.790 --> 01:01:42.330 align:middle line:90%
You don't remember?

01:01:42.330 --> 01:01:44.390 align:middle line:90%
That's part of your difficulty.

01:01:44.390 --> 01:01:45.350 align:middle line:90%
What's fun?

01:01:45.350 --> 01:01:46.250 align:middle line:90%
Work is fun.

01:01:46.250 --> 01:01:50.700 align:middle line:84%
No, your work is what's
caused your problem.

01:01:50.700 --> 01:01:52.330 align:middle line:90%
And that's why you're seeing me.

01:01:52.330 --> 01:01:56.240 align:middle line:84%
LEFL-- laughter,
excitement, fun, love.

01:01:56.240 --> 01:02:00.100 align:middle line:84%
And if you've got those full,
you don't have a problem.

01:02:00.100 --> 01:02:02.092 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: On that,
Steven, once again,

01:02:02.092 --> 01:02:03.300 align:middle line:90%
thank you for coming on here.

01:02:03.300 --> 01:02:03.650 align:middle line:90%
>>ROSS: Thank you, Regina.

01:02:03.650 --> 01:02:04.955 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: I really
appreciate it.

01:02:04.955 --> 01:02:05.810 align:middle line:90%
>>ROSS: I love you, Regina.

01:02:05.810 --> 01:02:06.330 align:middle line:90%
Thank you.

01:02:06.330 --> 01:02:07.747 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: I love
you, too, Steven.

01:02:07.747 --> 01:02:08.914 align:middle line:90%
I have such respect for you.

01:02:08.914 --> 01:02:09.714 align:middle line:90%
Thank you.

01:02:09.714 --> 01:02:10.520 align:middle line:90%
>>ROSS: Thank you.

01:02:10.520 --> 01:02:12.603 align:middle line:10%
>>REGINA: To check more
