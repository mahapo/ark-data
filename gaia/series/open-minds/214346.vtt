00:00:18.473 --> 00:00:19.890 align:middle line:10%
>>REGINA MEREDITH:
We've all heard

00:00:19.890 --> 00:00:21.840 align:middle line:10%
of the hardships
of the Dalai Lama

00:00:21.840 --> 00:00:24.640 align:middle line:10%
when the Chinese moved
in and took over Tibet.

00:00:24.640 --> 00:00:27.960 align:middle line:10%
But it's little known that
another religious sect far older

00:00:27.960 --> 00:00:31.290 align:middle line:10%
than Buddhism was also
brutalized and displaced

00:00:31.290 --> 00:00:32.689 align:middle line:10%
during this time.

00:00:32.689 --> 00:00:34.680 align:middle line:10%
Harvey Rice and
Jackie Cole are here

00:00:34.680 --> 00:00:37.830 align:middle line:10%
to tell us the harrowing
tale of the BÃ¶n Monks

00:00:37.830 --> 00:00:40.970 align:middle line:10%
and what it took to survive
the Chinese invasion.

00:00:40.970 --> 00:00:42.310 align:middle line:90%
What a tale.

00:00:42.310 --> 00:00:45.150 align:middle line:84%
This is like an adventure
tale from the very beginning

00:00:45.150 --> 00:00:46.210 align:middle line:90%
to the end.

00:00:46.210 --> 00:00:50.790 align:middle line:84%
I knew it was hard,
but I had no idea

00:00:50.790 --> 00:00:53.670 align:middle line:84%
how hard it was for
the Tibetan monks

00:00:53.670 --> 00:00:57.240 align:middle line:84%
and the Bon monks to be
able to save their relics,

00:00:57.240 --> 00:01:00.090 align:middle line:84%
and their tradition,
and their religion.

00:01:00.090 --> 00:01:04.890 align:middle line:84%
So first, I want to ask you,
this is 18,000 years old.

00:01:04.890 --> 00:01:07.490 align:middle line:84%
The Bon religion is
18,000 years old.

00:01:07.490 --> 00:01:11.750 align:middle line:84%
The oldest continuous religion
in the world that we know of?

00:01:11.750 --> 00:01:14.420 align:middle line:90%
>>JACKIE COLE: Possibly.

00:01:14.420 --> 00:01:17.510 align:middle line:10%
The Bonpos will say that the
history is that it was founded

00:01:17.510 --> 00:01:21.810 align:middle line:10%
by Tonpa Shenrab
18,000 years ago.

00:01:21.810 --> 00:01:24.720 align:middle line:10%
There is no written
language from back then.

00:01:24.720 --> 00:01:28.500 align:middle line:84%
And so we have to
take the oral history.

00:01:28.500 --> 00:01:30.720 align:middle line:84%
It was carried on
by oral history,

00:01:30.720 --> 00:01:32.790 align:middle line:84%
so we have to take
the oral history.

00:01:32.790 --> 00:01:36.740 align:middle line:84%
Buddhism was introduced into
Tibet in the seventh century.

00:01:36.740 --> 00:01:39.770 align:middle line:84%
And at that time,
Bon was outlawed.

00:01:39.770 --> 00:01:43.620 align:middle line:84%
And so it went underground
for a number of centuries.

00:01:43.620 --> 00:01:50.740 align:middle line:84%
And when it came back, it was
being again to be practiced.

00:01:50.740 --> 00:01:54.880 align:middle line:84%
It looked very much like
the Tibetan Buddhism did.

00:01:54.880 --> 00:01:58.240 align:middle line:10%
The Buddhists will say that
the Bon borrowed from them,

00:01:58.240 --> 00:02:00.320 align:middle line:10%
and the Bonpo said,
now wait a minute.

00:02:00.320 --> 00:02:01.590 align:middle line:10%
We were here first.

00:02:01.590 --> 00:02:04.310 align:middle line:84%
You all came in and
adapted all of our stuff.

00:02:04.310 --> 00:02:07.630 align:middle line:84%
So really, you're the ones
that borrowed from us.

00:02:07.630 --> 00:02:09.800 align:middle line:90%
They look very similar.

00:02:09.800 --> 00:02:13.810 align:middle line:84%
The basic tenets of
compassion, and kindness,

00:02:13.810 --> 00:02:20.090 align:middle line:84%
and learning to tame your
mind are all very similar.

00:02:20.090 --> 00:02:24.760 align:middle line:10%
Now Bon is much more
earth-based and deals--

00:02:24.760 --> 00:02:27.880 align:middle line:10%
has to deal with the
elements and the spirits

00:02:27.880 --> 00:02:31.810 align:middle line:10%
of the earth, most
likely because it was

00:02:31.810 --> 00:02:34.050 align:middle line:10%
the original religion there.

00:02:34.050 --> 00:02:36.990 align:middle line:90%
Tibet is very difficult--

00:02:36.990 --> 00:02:37.790 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Harsh.

00:02:37.790 --> 00:02:38.590 align:middle line:90%
>>COLE: Yes.

00:02:38.590 --> 00:02:40.820 align:middle line:84%
An extremely harsh and
difficult landscape.

00:02:40.820 --> 00:02:42.970 align:middle line:84%
And so you know
that the people who

00:02:42.970 --> 00:02:47.200 align:middle line:84%
live there would be appealing
to whatever they felt

00:02:47.200 --> 00:02:51.190 align:middle line:84%
were could help them to survive
and their crops to make it

00:02:51.190 --> 00:02:52.697 align:middle line:84%
and their animals
to stay healthy.

00:02:52.697 --> 00:02:54.530 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And you would
think that if you're

00:02:54.530 --> 00:02:56.690 align:middle line:84%
going for spiritual
development, go

00:02:56.690 --> 00:03:00.480 align:middle line:84%
to a place that doesn't have
anything else by and large,

00:03:00.480 --> 00:03:03.080 align:middle line:84%
and you're going to have a
good chance to really focus

00:03:03.080 --> 00:03:04.740 align:middle line:90%
on your internal spirit.

00:03:04.740 --> 00:03:07.180 align:middle line:84%
There aren't a lot of
distractions there.

00:03:07.180 --> 00:03:12.770 align:middle line:84%
>>COLE: It's really amazing in
that the Tibetan language has--

00:03:12.770 --> 00:03:17.450 align:middle line:84%
it's like thinking about
the Swedish languages that

00:03:17.450 --> 00:03:19.230 align:middle line:90%
has so many words for snow.

00:03:19.230 --> 00:03:22.520 align:middle line:84%
The Tibetan language has
all these different words

00:03:22.520 --> 00:03:26.090 align:middle line:84%
for your mind and different
levels of consciousness

00:03:26.090 --> 00:03:29.920 align:middle line:84%
and everything, all because they
have spent so much time there.

00:03:29.920 --> 00:03:30.720 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:03:30.720 --> 00:03:33.800 align:middle line:84%
>>COLE: And so many of
the teachings that we have

00:03:33.800 --> 00:03:38.240 align:middle line:84%
in the Bon tradition are the
examples that they use to help

00:03:38.240 --> 00:03:43.730 align:middle line:84%
you to understand what they're
talking about are based on sky,

00:03:43.730 --> 00:03:45.297 align:middle line:90%
and space--

00:03:45.297 --> 00:03:46.130 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: The water.

00:03:46.130 --> 00:03:49.460 align:middle line:84%
>>COLE: --and the
vastness, all of which

00:03:49.460 --> 00:03:53.640 align:middle line:84%
are the pure definition of
Tibet, which I understood.

00:03:53.640 --> 00:03:56.360 align:middle line:84%
But when you're there, it's
like learning something and then

00:03:56.360 --> 00:03:57.620 align:middle line:90%
experiencing it.

00:03:57.620 --> 00:04:00.330 align:middle line:84%
When you're there
and experience it,

00:04:00.330 --> 00:04:03.110 align:middle line:84%
I completely and
totally now understand

00:04:03.110 --> 00:04:08.000 align:middle line:84%
why all of their teachings is
based on sky, and vastness,

00:04:08.000 --> 00:04:09.020 align:middle line:90%
and space.

00:04:09.020 --> 00:04:09.820 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:04:09.820 --> 00:04:11.458 align:middle line:90%
>>COLE: It's incredible.

00:04:11.458 --> 00:04:12.750 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: It makes total sense.

00:04:12.750 --> 00:04:14.280 align:middle line:90%
And Harvey, you're a journalist.

00:04:14.280 --> 00:04:16.459 align:middle line:84%
Give us a little bit of
your journalistic background

00:04:16.459 --> 00:04:20.407 align:middle line:84%
and how you got swept
into all of this.

00:04:20.407 --> 00:04:21.240 align:middle line:10%
>>HARVEY RICE: Yeah.

00:04:21.240 --> 00:04:24.020 align:middle line:10%
I've been a journalist
for about 40 years.

00:04:24.020 --> 00:04:28.310 align:middle line:10%
And at that time, I was working
for the Houston Chronicle,

00:04:28.310 --> 00:04:33.620 align:middle line:10%
and I worked out of my house.

00:04:33.620 --> 00:04:35.600 align:middle line:90%
And so I was sitting at my desk.

00:04:35.600 --> 00:04:40.290 align:middle line:84%
And Jackie came in one
day, and she said--

00:04:40.290 --> 00:04:41.540 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Want to go to Tibet?

00:04:41.540 --> 00:04:45.950 align:middle line:84%
>> RICE: Well, she said, I've
learned this incredible story

00:04:45.950 --> 00:04:47.580 align:middle line:90%
from my teachers.

00:04:47.580 --> 00:04:52.460 align:middle line:84%
And she told me about it,
about how Tenzin Namdak had

00:04:52.460 --> 00:04:54.060 align:middle line:90%
been shot and left for dead.

00:04:54.060 --> 00:04:59.580 align:middle line:84%
And she said, what do you think
about doing a book about that?

00:04:59.580 --> 00:05:01.432 align:middle line:90%
And I said, yes, let's do it.

00:05:01.432 --> 00:05:02.232 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:05:02.232 --> 00:05:06.930 align:middle line:84%
>> RICE: And so that's
when the book really began.

00:05:06.930 --> 00:05:08.010 align:middle line:90%
We began work on it.

00:05:08.010 --> 00:05:12.650 align:middle line:84%
And I had no idea where
the story would take us

00:05:12.650 --> 00:05:14.750 align:middle line:84%
because at that
point, we just knew

00:05:14.750 --> 00:05:20.330 align:middle line:84%
about him escaping and being
shot, and he had survived that.

00:05:20.330 --> 00:05:22.290 align:middle line:84%
But we didn't know
all the details.

00:05:22.290 --> 00:05:27.290 align:middle line:84%
We didn't know at that time
that they had actually--

00:05:27.290 --> 00:05:32.180 align:middle line:84%
would meet this Tibetologist,
who would take them to London,

00:05:32.180 --> 00:05:38.240 align:middle line:84%
and it would change their
lives and change their ability

00:05:38.240 --> 00:05:41.780 align:middle line:84%
to refound their
religion in India, out

00:05:41.780 --> 00:05:44.690 align:middle line:90%
of the grasp of the Chinese.

00:05:44.690 --> 00:05:47.918 align:middle line:84%
Because the Chinese
would allow nothing--

00:05:47.918 --> 00:05:49.710 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Oh, we're
going to get into that.

00:05:49.710 --> 00:05:52.480 align:middle line:84%
>> RICE: --in Tibet without
them being able to control it.

00:05:52.480 --> 00:05:53.280 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:05:53.280 --> 00:05:56.460 align:middle line:84%
And what it did is it
also, for the first time

00:05:56.460 --> 00:06:00.240 align:middle line:84%
in modern history, brought
the Tibetan and Bon religion

00:06:00.240 --> 00:06:02.970 align:middle line:84%
alive to the world,
which really--

00:06:02.970 --> 00:06:05.370 align:middle line:84%
we didn't really have a
lot of understanding of it.

00:06:05.370 --> 00:06:06.850 align:middle line:90%
And there was a reason for that.

00:06:06.850 --> 00:06:08.410 align:middle line:84%
They pretty much
kept to themselves.

00:06:08.410 --> 00:06:10.380 align:middle line:84%
And I remember
reading in the book

00:06:10.380 --> 00:06:13.540 align:middle line:84%
that it was hard
to get many allies.

00:06:13.540 --> 00:06:17.130 align:middle line:84%
We'll go into what happened
with Mao and all that

00:06:17.130 --> 00:06:19.050 align:middle line:90%
or Chiang Kai-Shek.

00:06:19.050 --> 00:06:22.320 align:middle line:84%
Hard to get a lot of allies
together when you're even

00:06:22.320 --> 00:06:25.800 align:middle line:84%
suspecting neighbors from the
neighboring village because you

00:06:25.800 --> 00:06:29.640 align:middle line:84%
have differences like one of
you puts yak butter in your tea

00:06:29.640 --> 00:06:30.880 align:middle line:90%
and the other doesn't.

00:06:30.880 --> 00:06:33.370 align:middle line:84%
And this creates
suspicion between people.

00:06:33.370 --> 00:06:38.130 align:middle line:84%
These are very isolated people
with set deeply set traditions

00:06:38.130 --> 00:06:40.600 align:middle line:84%
and not really part
of the outside world.

00:06:40.600 --> 00:06:43.067 align:middle line:84%
So there was no one to
really come to their aid.

00:06:43.067 --> 00:06:43.930 align:middle line:90%
>>COLE: Yeah.

00:06:43.930 --> 00:06:46.530 align:middle line:84%
They had isolated--
the country itself

00:06:46.530 --> 00:06:48.720 align:middle line:90%
had been isolated on purpose.

00:06:48.720 --> 00:06:52.200 align:middle line:90%
And the central government--

00:06:52.200 --> 00:06:54.100 align:middle line:90%
Tibet is so huge.

00:06:54.100 --> 00:06:57.390 align:middle line:84%
The central government
is set in around Lhasa.

00:06:57.390 --> 00:07:01.500 align:middle line:84%
And then you have these
vast areas of Kham and Amdo

00:07:01.500 --> 00:07:05.230 align:middle line:84%
out over in the eastern part,
which are closer to China.

00:07:05.230 --> 00:07:09.780 align:middle line:84%
And even though the Dalai
Lama was both the secular

00:07:09.780 --> 00:07:14.280 align:middle line:84%
and religious head of
Tibet, the people out here

00:07:14.280 --> 00:07:17.970 align:middle line:84%
really didn't listen very much
to the government in Lhasa

00:07:17.970 --> 00:07:19.660 align:middle line:84%
because they were
just so far away.

00:07:19.660 --> 00:07:20.890 align:middle line:90%
There were no roads.

00:07:20.890 --> 00:07:22.360 align:middle line:90%
There's no telegrams.

00:07:22.360 --> 00:07:26.760 align:middle line:84%
There's no communication
except by whoever's going

00:07:26.760 --> 00:07:28.920 align:middle line:90%
back and forth for trading.

00:07:28.920 --> 00:07:35.430 align:middle line:84%
And so there was at one point in
the '40s and people who wanted

00:07:35.430 --> 00:07:40.650 align:middle line:84%
to reform the government to the
point of providing a little bit

00:07:40.650 --> 00:07:45.930 align:middle line:84%
more outside influence and
also developing an army

00:07:45.930 --> 00:07:49.900 align:middle line:84%
for protection and
so on and so forth.

00:07:49.900 --> 00:07:56.130 align:middle line:84%
But they were actually defeated
by the central government,

00:07:56.130 --> 00:07:58.050 align:middle line:84%
pieces of the central
government who

00:07:58.050 --> 00:08:02.740 align:middle line:84%
felt that reform would,
for a number of reasons,

00:08:02.740 --> 00:08:05.490 align:middle line:84%
take power away from
the monasteries which

00:08:05.490 --> 00:08:07.060 align:middle line:90%
were very powerful.

00:08:07.060 --> 00:08:09.300 align:middle line:84%
So take power away
from the monasteries

00:08:09.300 --> 00:08:13.860 align:middle line:84%
and also have the
potential to defile

00:08:13.860 --> 00:08:20.110 align:middle line:84%
or anger the gods of the earth,
which they didn't want to do.

00:08:20.110 --> 00:08:23.470 align:middle line:84%
Because in order to do a lot of
that would have to modernize,

00:08:23.470 --> 00:08:26.070 align:middle line:84%
build roads, maybe
do some mining

00:08:26.070 --> 00:08:29.080 align:middle line:84%
to get money in order to
do these other things,

00:08:29.080 --> 00:08:30.940 align:middle line:84%
to stand up an
army and so forth.

00:08:30.940 --> 00:08:34.526 align:middle line:84%
And they just didn't want
to disturb what was--

00:08:34.526 --> 00:08:36.359 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Their
relationship with the beings

00:08:36.359 --> 00:08:37.780 align:middle line:90%
that look over the earth.

00:08:37.780 --> 00:08:38.580 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:08:38.580 --> 00:08:43.720 align:middle line:84%
>>COLE: And the power structure
that was in place at the time.

00:08:43.720 --> 00:08:46.000 align:middle line:90%
So they maintain that.

00:08:46.000 --> 00:08:48.600 align:middle line:84%
And because of that,
they had no allies,

00:08:48.600 --> 00:08:51.730 align:middle line:84%
and they had no
outside contacts much.

00:08:51.730 --> 00:08:55.090 align:middle line:84%
There had been a British
expedition previous to that.

00:08:55.090 --> 00:09:00.240 align:middle line:84%
But at the time China
invaded, the world politics

00:09:00.240 --> 00:09:03.550 align:middle line:84%
was such that the big nations
that could have saved them,

00:09:03.550 --> 00:09:06.450 align:middle line:84%
India and Britain and
the United States,

00:09:06.450 --> 00:09:08.530 align:middle line:84%
didn't want to get
into it with China.

00:09:08.530 --> 00:09:09.330 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:09:09.330 --> 00:09:13.210 align:middle line:84%
And so we're going to go down
that little rabbit hole in a bit

00:09:13.210 --> 00:09:14.010 align:middle line:90%
here.

00:09:14.010 --> 00:09:15.750 align:middle line:84%
First of all, you guys
ended up traveling

00:09:15.750 --> 00:09:17.380 align:middle line:90%
to Tibet, Nepal, India.

00:09:17.380 --> 00:09:19.470 align:middle line:84%
And I want to say
that the Dalai Lama

00:09:19.470 --> 00:09:21.660 align:middle line:84%
himself wrote the
foreword to your book

00:09:21.660 --> 00:09:24.000 align:middle line:84%
because, well, he
isn't he the one

00:09:24.000 --> 00:09:28.553 align:middle line:84%
that actually sanctified
the practice of the Bonpos?

00:09:28.553 --> 00:09:31.290 align:middle line:90%


00:09:31.290 --> 00:09:34.740 align:middle line:10%
>> RICE: It was
in, I think, 1978,

00:09:34.740 --> 00:09:41.760 align:middle line:10%
he made Bon one of the
official religions of Tibet.

00:09:41.760 --> 00:09:43.710 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: After being
underground for so long.

00:09:43.710 --> 00:09:47.230 align:middle line:84%
>> RICE: But prior to
that, even to this day,

00:09:47.230 --> 00:09:49.690 align:middle line:84%
there are still some
Buddhists, Tibetan Buddhists,

00:09:49.690 --> 00:09:57.250 align:middle line:84%
who looked down their noses at
Bonpos as not being the correct

00:09:57.250 --> 00:09:58.070 align:middle line:90%
religion.

00:09:58.070 --> 00:10:04.740 align:middle line:84%
But the Dalai Lama
has accepted them.

00:10:04.740 --> 00:10:10.762 align:middle line:84%
But there has been a long
history of Buddhist oppression.

00:10:10.762 --> 00:10:11.580 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:10:11.580 --> 00:10:14.580 align:middle line:84%
So now let's get into
this meat of the story.

00:10:14.580 --> 00:10:17.980 align:middle line:84%
A little kid named
Tenzin, right?

00:10:17.980 --> 00:10:19.950 align:middle line:90%
He was part of the Bon.

00:10:19.950 --> 00:10:23.490 align:middle line:84%
And then we also, I think
it's important to lay out

00:10:23.490 --> 00:10:27.340 align:middle line:84%
that in terms of reading,
writing, education in general,

00:10:27.340 --> 00:10:29.110 align:middle line:84%
it all happens
through the monastery.

00:10:29.110 --> 00:10:31.740 align:middle line:84%
So to have your child
go into the monastery

00:10:31.740 --> 00:10:35.890 align:middle line:84%
is a privilege because they're
going to become educated for one

00:10:35.890 --> 00:10:37.920 align:middle line:84%
because there aren't
really, it sounds,

00:10:37.920 --> 00:10:41.370 align:middle line:84%
like educational facilities
outside of the monasteries back

00:10:41.370 --> 00:10:42.425 align:middle line:90%
in the day.

00:10:42.425 --> 00:10:46.000 align:middle line:84%
>>COLE: In the 50s, there
weren't any schools per se.

00:10:46.000 --> 00:10:48.720 align:middle line:84%
You had traveling monks
or traveling teachers

00:10:48.720 --> 00:10:51.100 align:middle line:84%
who would come around
and try to teach people,

00:10:51.100 --> 00:10:52.450 align:middle line:90%
teach the kids for a little bit.

00:10:52.450 --> 00:10:55.650 align:middle line:84%
But all of the education
was in the monasteries.

00:10:55.650 --> 00:10:58.980 align:middle line:84%
And it was a tradition
of the families

00:10:58.980 --> 00:11:02.130 align:middle line:84%
that the firstborn son
would go to the monasteries.

00:11:02.130 --> 00:11:08.900 align:middle line:84%
They both felt like it was
a donation to the faith,

00:11:08.900 --> 00:11:13.750 align:middle line:84%
but it was also a way to
provide their son with a better

00:11:13.750 --> 00:11:18.640 align:middle line:84%
life, because otherwise, it
was a difficult, hard life,

00:11:18.640 --> 00:11:24.950 align:middle line:84%
either as a farmer, or as a
herder of animals, or a trader.

00:11:24.950 --> 00:11:26.860 align:middle line:84%
If you were wealthy,
you often would

00:11:26.860 --> 00:11:30.640 align:middle line:84%
trade, which would mean
long treks with the yaks

00:11:30.640 --> 00:11:32.740 align:middle line:90%
and usually in the winter.

00:11:32.740 --> 00:11:35.480 align:middle line:90%
So it was a very difficult life.

00:11:35.480 --> 00:11:40.570 align:middle line:84%
So the monastery provided some
relief for some of the children.

00:11:40.570 --> 00:11:43.820 align:middle line:84%
It's interesting, the three
main characters that we had.

00:11:43.820 --> 00:11:46.700 align:middle line:90%
One wanted to be a monk.

00:11:46.700 --> 00:11:48.920 align:middle line:84%
The second one never
wanted to be a monk,

00:11:48.920 --> 00:11:50.630 align:middle line:90%
but his parents sent him anyway.

00:11:50.630 --> 00:11:53.770 align:middle line:84%
And the third one,
the family wanted--

00:11:53.770 --> 00:11:57.110 align:middle line:84%
Sangye Tenzin, his family wanted
him to stay in the business,

00:11:57.110 --> 00:11:58.850 align:middle line:84%
and he said, no, I
want to be a monk.

00:11:58.850 --> 00:11:59.060 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:11:59.060 --> 00:11:59.720 align:middle line:90%
They had some money.

00:11:59.720 --> 00:12:00.970 align:middle line:90%
They were a little better off.

00:12:00.970 --> 00:12:02.272 align:middle line:90%
So let's talk about Tenzin.

00:12:02.272 --> 00:12:03.730 align:middle line:84%
We're going to
start with his story

00:12:03.730 --> 00:12:05.350 align:middle line:84%
because he was a
stubborn little guy

00:12:05.350 --> 00:12:08.180 align:middle line:84%
and came from a family
of artists, right?

00:12:08.180 --> 00:12:09.820 align:middle line:90%
And these artists did--

00:12:09.820 --> 00:12:12.730 align:middle line:84%
his father it was
or grandfather that

00:12:12.730 --> 00:12:15.340 align:middle line:84%
did beautiful paintings
inside of a couple

00:12:15.340 --> 00:12:17.193 align:middle line:84%
of the great
monasteries of theirs.

00:12:17.193 --> 00:12:18.860 align:middle line:84%
>>COLE: It was his
mother's grandfather.

00:12:18.860 --> 00:12:22.060 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: The grandfather.

00:12:22.060 --> 00:12:25.000 align:middle line:84%
>>COLE: So the maternal
side of his family

00:12:25.000 --> 00:12:26.690 align:middle line:90%
were an artist family.

00:12:26.690 --> 00:12:29.630 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So he learned
how to do artwork.

00:12:29.630 --> 00:12:30.430 align:middle line:90%
>>COLE: Yes.

00:12:30.430 --> 00:12:31.230 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: OK.

00:12:31.230 --> 00:12:32.540 align:middle line:90%
So he had a skill.

00:12:32.540 --> 00:12:35.200 align:middle line:84%
So let's talk about where
he's insistent he's going

00:12:35.200 --> 00:12:36.350 align:middle line:90%
to lead the spiritual life.

00:12:36.350 --> 00:12:37.460 align:middle line:90%
He's going to be a monk.

00:12:37.460 --> 00:12:38.510 align:middle line:90%
No one's stopping him.

00:12:38.510 --> 00:12:39.310 align:middle line:90%
>>COLE: Right.

00:12:39.310 --> 00:12:40.640 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: No one stopped him.

00:12:40.640 --> 00:12:45.100 align:middle line:84%
I just found out he
turns 100 in 2025.

00:12:45.100 --> 00:12:46.340 align:middle line:90%
This is a spoiler alert.

00:12:46.340 --> 00:12:47.540 align:middle line:90%
These are horrific things.

00:12:47.540 --> 00:12:48.740 align:middle line:90%
He made it through all this.

00:12:48.740 --> 00:12:50.000 align:middle line:90%
What a spirit.

00:12:50.000 --> 00:12:50.800 align:middle line:90%
>>COLE: Yes.

00:12:50.800 --> 00:12:51.830 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

00:12:51.830 --> 00:12:54.490 align:middle line:84%
And it's interesting, when
you're in his presence,

00:12:54.490 --> 00:12:59.830 align:middle line:84%
you feel nothing
but peace and calm.

00:12:59.830 --> 00:13:02.180 align:middle line:90%
He carries that spirit with him.

00:13:02.180 --> 00:13:05.200 align:middle line:84%
And yet his indomitable
spirit is what

00:13:05.200 --> 00:13:07.460 align:middle line:90%
has allowed Bon to survive.

00:13:07.460 --> 00:13:09.460 align:middle line:84%
If you ask most of
the Bonpos, they'll

00:13:09.460 --> 00:13:12.790 align:middle line:84%
say that he saved
Bon a second time.

00:13:12.790 --> 00:13:17.900 align:middle line:90%
So he became a monk.

00:13:17.900 --> 00:13:23.440 align:middle line:84%
And then through the art, he
was in a part of the country

00:13:23.440 --> 00:13:25.210 align:middle line:84%
away from where he
had been, the part

00:13:25.210 --> 00:13:29.470 align:middle line:84%
of the country that was closest
to the mother monastery, Menri.

00:13:29.470 --> 00:13:34.540 align:middle line:84%
So he traveled over there to
become ordained as a monk,

00:13:34.540 --> 00:13:37.120 align:middle line:84%
to take his vows, and
then went on a pilgrimage,

00:13:37.120 --> 00:13:44.190 align:middle line:84%
and then went back
there to learn to study.

00:13:44.190 --> 00:13:48.220 align:middle line:84%
So he wanted to study
with the best master.

00:13:48.220 --> 00:13:52.650 align:middle line:84%
So he went four years to
a cave and lived up there.

00:13:52.650 --> 00:13:54.875 align:middle line:90%
And talk about persistence--

00:13:54.875 --> 00:13:56.500 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: He just
kept bugging the guy.

00:13:56.500 --> 00:13:58.260 align:middle line:84%
>>COLE: He just
kept bugging him.

00:13:58.260 --> 00:13:59.270 align:middle line:90%
Knock, knock, knock.

00:13:59.270 --> 00:14:01.060 align:middle line:90%
Please take me on as a student.

00:14:01.060 --> 00:14:01.860 align:middle line:90%
No.

00:14:01.860 --> 00:14:03.720 align:middle line:90%
Knock, knock, knock.

00:14:03.720 --> 00:14:09.370 align:middle line:84%
And I think the master saw
in him not just perseverance

00:14:09.370 --> 00:14:12.720 align:middle line:84%
but the future of Bon
because he figured out a way

00:14:12.720 --> 00:14:16.290 align:middle line:84%
to take him on and not
irritate the whole group

00:14:16.290 --> 00:14:19.000 align:middle line:84%
of other students who had
come that he had turned away.

00:14:19.000 --> 00:14:21.480 align:middle line:84%
And that was he said,
well, as long as you're

00:14:21.480 --> 00:14:24.600 align:middle line:84%
painting these little
story cards for me,

00:14:24.600 --> 00:14:25.800 align:middle line:90%
then I'll teach you.

00:14:25.800 --> 00:14:31.660 align:middle line:84%
Yes, well, it ended up four
years of him instructing him.

00:14:31.660 --> 00:14:35.250 align:middle line:84%
So this was very
consequential to his life

00:14:35.250 --> 00:14:37.120 align:middle line:90%
in terms of his development.

00:14:37.120 --> 00:14:40.500 align:middle line:84%
And he was going to go
from there to the cave

00:14:40.500 --> 00:14:44.170 align:middle line:84%
back over in home in Amdo
and live the rest of his life

00:14:44.170 --> 00:14:45.110 align:middle line:90%
in meditation.

00:14:45.110 --> 00:14:48.850 align:middle line:90%
And his teacher said, no.

00:14:48.850 --> 00:14:53.265 align:middle line:84%
The future needs you
to know everything.

00:14:53.265 --> 00:14:54.140 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: And he did.

00:14:54.140 --> 00:14:54.940 align:middle line:90%
He was.

00:14:54.940 --> 00:14:59.450 align:middle line:84%
He was insatiable in terms
of his seeking of knowledge.

00:14:59.450 --> 00:15:00.640 align:middle line:90%
>>COLE: Yes

00:15:00.640 --> 00:15:02.720 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Became a
true, true master.

00:15:02.720 --> 00:15:05.270 align:middle line:84%
Meanwhile, let's look at
the political backdrop.

00:15:05.270 --> 00:15:07.040 align:middle line:90%
So we have Chiang Kai-Shek.

00:15:07.040 --> 00:15:09.310 align:middle line:84%
Are they kind of left alone
under Chiang Kai-Shek,

00:15:09.310 --> 00:15:11.270 align:middle line:84%
or is he trying to
move in on Tibet?

00:15:11.270 --> 00:15:14.770 align:middle line:84%
>> RICE: Chiang Kai-Shek tried
because even under Chiang

00:15:14.770 --> 00:15:18.140 align:middle line:84%
Kai-Shek, they believed that
Tibet was part of China,

00:15:18.140 --> 00:15:24.430 align:middle line:84%
that sort of a basic
Chinese belief.

00:15:24.430 --> 00:15:30.910 align:middle line:84%
And so he did establish some
garrisons in the Eastern

00:15:30.910 --> 00:15:34.550 align:middle line:84%
provinces, but those
were largely ignored,

00:15:34.550 --> 00:15:36.190 align:middle line:90%
and they didn't really--

00:15:36.190 --> 00:15:41.060 align:middle line:84%
he didn't have any real
political clout in Tibet.

00:15:41.060 --> 00:15:43.510 align:middle line:84%
And so there was
a garrison there,

00:15:43.510 --> 00:15:44.780 align:middle line:90%
and they were just ignored.

00:15:44.780 --> 00:15:46.300 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: He wasn't really
trying to shut them down

00:15:46.300 --> 00:15:47.610 align:middle line:90%
at that point or anything.

00:15:47.610 --> 00:15:47.660 align:middle line:90%
>> RICE: No.

00:15:47.660 --> 00:15:49.460 align:middle line:84%
And he didn't have
the wherewithal

00:15:49.460 --> 00:15:54.680 align:middle line:84%
to really go to Lawson and
really take over the country.

00:15:54.680 --> 00:15:56.980 align:middle line:84%
He was not really
able to do that.

00:15:56.980 --> 00:16:00.640 align:middle line:84%
And that was just sort of
a token effort on his part

00:16:00.640 --> 00:16:01.440 align:middle line:90%
to try to--

00:16:01.440 --> 00:16:04.980 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: But Mao Tse
Tung was more efficient.

00:16:04.980 --> 00:16:08.820 align:middle line:84%
>> RICE: Because he beat
Chiang Kai-Shek and drove him

00:16:08.820 --> 00:16:11.300 align:middle line:90%
to Taiwan.

00:16:11.300 --> 00:16:16.230 align:middle line:84%
And that was part
of his next step.

00:16:16.230 --> 00:16:18.890 align:middle line:90%
He was going to get China--

00:16:18.890 --> 00:16:21.620 align:middle line:90%
I'm sorry, Tibet, I mean to say.

00:16:21.620 --> 00:16:24.510 align:middle line:90%
And he accomplished that.

00:16:24.510 --> 00:16:30.390 align:middle line:84%
He had a very experienced army
who had been fighting for years,

00:16:30.390 --> 00:16:32.880 align:middle line:84%
and they had driven
Chiang Kai-Shek off.

00:16:32.880 --> 00:16:35.810 align:middle line:84%
And they had they were
supported by the Soviets,

00:16:35.810 --> 00:16:37.610 align:middle line:84%
and they had a lot
of American arms

00:16:37.610 --> 00:16:42.170 align:middle line:84%
because the Americans had even
supported Mao against the Jap

00:16:42.170 --> 00:16:44.580 align:middle line:84%
when they were
fighting the Japanese.

00:16:44.580 --> 00:16:50.100 align:middle line:84%
So they were well-armed, and
they're very disciplined,

00:16:50.100 --> 00:16:52.840 align:middle line:84%
and he was able
to make it happen.

00:16:52.840 --> 00:16:54.600 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And he
had an agenda, which

00:16:54.600 --> 00:16:58.525 align:middle line:84%
was to stomp out these
belief systems also.

00:16:58.525 --> 00:16:59.650 align:middle line:90%
That was part of it, right?

00:16:59.650 --> 00:17:00.525 align:middle line:90%
>> RICE: That's true.

00:17:00.525 --> 00:17:04.450 align:middle line:84%
Well, originally, Mao
had his original idea

00:17:04.450 --> 00:17:10.289 align:middle line:84%
was that they didn't
push it too much.

00:17:10.289 --> 00:17:11.089 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:17:11.089 --> 00:17:12.589 align:middle line:84%
They were there to,
quote, liberate.

00:17:12.589 --> 00:17:15.520 align:middle line:84%
There was a PR campaign
to liberate these people.

00:17:15.520 --> 00:17:17.609 align:middle line:90%
From what?

00:17:17.609 --> 00:17:22.540 align:middle line:84%
>> RICE: Well, there was nothing
really to liberate them from,

00:17:22.540 --> 00:17:25.859 align:middle line:84%
but they just said that, oh,
we're going to liberate you

00:17:25.859 --> 00:17:26.730 align:middle line:90%
from--

00:17:26.730 --> 00:17:34.030 align:middle line:84%
They had this sort of critique
of capitalism and imperialism,

00:17:34.030 --> 00:17:36.310 align:middle line:84%
and they just imposed
that onto Tibet,

00:17:36.310 --> 00:17:38.970 align:middle line:84%
where there had been no
imperialism and certainly

00:17:38.970 --> 00:17:44.590 align:middle line:84%
no capitalism at all, except
in they had sort of maybe--

00:17:44.590 --> 00:17:47.565 align:middle line:90%


00:17:47.565 --> 00:17:48.940 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Well,
you said traders.

00:17:48.940 --> 00:17:49.898 align:middle line:90%
>> RICE: Yeah, traders.

00:17:49.898 --> 00:17:54.820 align:middle line:84%
They did trade, but there was
no capitalist corporations

00:17:54.820 --> 00:17:58.182 align:middle line:84%
or people loaning big money to
companies or anything like that.

00:17:58.182 --> 00:18:00.640 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: But it must have
appealed to some of the Tibetans

00:18:00.640 --> 00:18:03.045 align:middle line:84%
that they were going
to be liberated.

00:18:03.045 --> 00:18:05.990 align:middle line:84%
>>COLE: It didn't
appeal to any of them.

00:18:05.990 --> 00:18:06.790 align:middle line:90%
>> RICE: Very few.

00:18:06.790 --> 00:18:09.040 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So they just
basically bullied their way in,

00:18:09.040 --> 00:18:10.780 align:middle line:84%
and then really
the brutality began

00:18:10.780 --> 00:18:12.290 align:middle line:90%
because they wanted that land.

00:18:12.290 --> 00:18:15.880 align:middle line:84%
>>COLE: The brutality
began after they

00:18:15.880 --> 00:18:19.210 align:middle line:84%
had been able to set
up an infrastructure.

00:18:19.210 --> 00:18:22.120 align:middle line:84%
So they invaded,
and they got as far

00:18:22.120 --> 00:18:25.020 align:middle line:84%
as they could get on the
infrastructure that was already

00:18:25.020 --> 00:18:25.820 align:middle line:90%
there.

00:18:25.820 --> 00:18:27.400 align:middle line:90%
And then they stopped.

00:18:27.400 --> 00:18:29.780 align:middle line:84%
And then they started
building roads.

00:18:29.780 --> 00:18:33.220 align:middle line:84%
And when they got the roads
built all the way into Lhasa

00:18:33.220 --> 00:18:38.840 align:middle line:84%
to where they could supply
the army and to move,

00:18:38.840 --> 00:18:42.363 align:middle line:84%
then they started
in on crackdowns.

00:18:42.363 --> 00:18:43.780 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And what
they were doing

00:18:43.780 --> 00:18:48.110 align:middle line:84%
was essentially taking the
monks and imprisoning them

00:18:48.110 --> 00:18:50.560 align:middle line:84%
and shutting down
the monasteries.

00:18:50.560 --> 00:18:52.680 align:middle line:84%
They started
brutalizing the nuns.

00:18:52.680 --> 00:18:53.480 align:middle line:90%
>> RICE: Yes.

00:18:53.480 --> 00:18:56.120 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And it was, really,
this was quite horrific

00:18:56.120 --> 00:18:59.460 align:middle line:84%
when you read about when they
first extended into Tibet.

00:18:59.460 --> 00:19:02.570 align:middle line:84%
I mean, taking these
poor nuns and raping them

00:19:02.570 --> 00:19:04.350 align:middle line:90%
in public in front of people.

00:19:04.350 --> 00:19:07.040 align:middle line:84%
I mean, the Chinese really
were brutal with the Tibetans

00:19:07.040 --> 00:19:08.900 align:middle line:90%
beyond what I understood.

00:19:08.900 --> 00:19:11.130 align:middle line:84%
>>COLE: It was,
especially that case.

00:19:11.130 --> 00:19:13.710 align:middle line:84%
It was about about the
first four or five years,

00:19:13.710 --> 00:19:15.510 align:middle line:90%
they were OK.

00:19:15.510 --> 00:19:18.300 align:middle line:84%
But as they got their
infrastructure better set up,

00:19:18.300 --> 00:19:21.110 align:middle line:84%
then they began
to reverse course

00:19:21.110 --> 00:19:25.800 align:middle line:84%
in terms of having
coexistence to suppression.

00:19:25.800 --> 00:19:26.600 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:19:26.600 --> 00:19:32.120 align:middle line:10%
>>COLE: They needed to do
that because the religion was

00:19:32.120 --> 00:19:36.290 align:middle line:10%
so intertwined with the
government and everything,

00:19:36.290 --> 00:19:38.760 align:middle line:10%
so that you couldn't separate--

00:19:38.760 --> 00:19:41.250 align:middle line:10%
It wasn't like religion was
separate from the government.

00:19:41.250 --> 00:19:43.292 align:middle line:84%
So if you were going to
overthrow the government,

00:19:43.292 --> 00:19:44.850 align:middle line:84%
you have to overthrow
the religion.

00:19:44.850 --> 00:19:46.850 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: It was like
commercialism in the West.

00:19:46.850 --> 00:19:51.210 align:middle line:84%
It's part of the fabric
of Western society,

00:19:51.210 --> 00:19:53.717 align:middle line:84%
and religion was part
of their society.

00:19:53.717 --> 00:19:55.050 align:middle line:90%
I understand what you're saying.

00:19:55.050 --> 00:19:57.030 align:middle line:84%
Yeah so they had to tear
the whole thing down.

00:19:57.030 --> 00:19:58.655 align:middle line:10%
>>COLE: They tore
the whole thing down.

00:19:58.655 --> 00:20:02.910 align:middle line:10%
And they also flipped for
anybody who was wealthy,

00:20:02.910 --> 00:20:04.410 align:middle line:10%
they took their wealth away.

00:20:04.410 --> 00:20:09.233 align:middle line:84%
So it was black became
white and up became down.

00:20:09.233 --> 00:20:11.150 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And they turned
the Tibetan families

00:20:11.150 --> 00:20:13.010 align:middle line:90%
against each other even.

00:20:13.010 --> 00:20:14.580 align:middle line:90%
Some were operating as spies.

00:20:14.580 --> 00:20:16.730 align:middle line:84%
I mean, that's kind
of hard to imagine

00:20:16.730 --> 00:20:19.460 align:middle line:84%
that it could have been so dire
that they would have turned

00:20:19.460 --> 00:20:22.080 align:middle line:84%
against each other and
aligned with the Chinese,

00:20:22.080 --> 00:20:25.160 align:middle line:84%
but they didn't really
have a lot of choice.

00:20:25.160 --> 00:20:32.840 align:middle line:84%
>> RICE: Well, originally,
Mao himself thought it was OK

00:20:32.840 --> 00:20:39.940 align:middle line:84%
to just let the religion exist
for a while until the times were

00:20:39.940 --> 00:20:40.740 align:middle line:90%
ripe.

00:20:40.740 --> 00:20:43.110 align:middle line:10%
But then you had
an administration,

00:20:43.110 --> 00:20:46.520 align:middle line:10%
a Communist administration
in Tibet that

00:20:46.520 --> 00:20:49.230 align:middle line:10%
was overseeing on the ground.

00:20:49.230 --> 00:20:52.160 align:middle line:10%
You had a very large
Communist organization,

00:20:52.160 --> 00:20:56.810 align:middle line:10%
and they had recruited some
Tibetans into that as well.

00:20:56.810 --> 00:21:01.970 align:middle line:84%
They were more aggressive
than Mao himself,

00:21:01.970 --> 00:21:05.610 align:middle line:84%
at least the documents
show that he was.

00:21:05.610 --> 00:21:12.020 align:middle line:84%
And so they wanted to be
more forceful in imposing

00:21:12.020 --> 00:21:13.826 align:middle line:90%
Communist ideology.

00:21:13.826 --> 00:21:16.460 align:middle line:90%


00:21:16.460 --> 00:21:23.020 align:middle line:84%
And they saw religion
as an opponent.

00:21:23.020 --> 00:21:23.820 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:21:23.820 --> 00:21:24.620 align:middle line:90%
A threat.

00:21:24.620 --> 00:21:25.690 align:middle line:90%
>> RICE: And as a threat.

00:21:25.690 --> 00:21:34.090 align:middle line:84%
So in about 1956, you see
revolt, military revolt,

00:21:34.090 --> 00:21:37.390 align:middle line:84%
armed revolt begin
in Kham and Amdo.

00:21:37.390 --> 00:21:39.748 align:middle line:90%
And it's spontaneous at first.

00:21:39.748 --> 00:21:41.290 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: The eastern
parts of Tibet.

00:21:41.290 --> 00:21:43.470 align:middle line:84%
>> RICE: Because the
Chinese went in there.

00:21:43.470 --> 00:21:47.520 align:middle line:84%
And in Kham, that
was sort of like this

00:21:47.520 --> 00:21:51.330 align:middle line:84%
is a province where the
people were warriors,

00:21:51.330 --> 00:21:53.590 align:middle line:84%
and they always
went around armed.

00:21:53.590 --> 00:21:55.900 align:middle line:84%
And so the first
thing the Chinese did,

00:21:55.900 --> 00:21:57.870 align:middle line:90%
they took away their arms.

00:21:57.870 --> 00:22:01.470 align:middle line:84%
And so you cannot carry
rifles or swords anymore.

00:22:01.470 --> 00:22:05.880 align:middle line:84%
And that was an
insult. And so you

00:22:05.880 --> 00:22:08.460 align:middle line:84%
started seeing they could
only take that so long,

00:22:08.460 --> 00:22:10.330 align:middle line:84%
and you started seeing
armed rebellion.

00:22:10.330 --> 00:22:14.410 align:middle line:84%
And that's when the
repression really began.

00:22:14.410 --> 00:22:19.060 align:middle line:84%
So the worst repression is
beginning in Kham and Amdo

00:22:19.060 --> 00:22:23.120 align:middle line:90%
before it reaches Lhasa.

00:22:23.120 --> 00:22:26.730 align:middle line:84%
Because the Chinese military
is obviously way more advanced,

00:22:26.730 --> 00:22:29.790 align:middle line:84%
have better weapons, better
tactics, and modern tactics,

00:22:29.790 --> 00:22:33.890 align:middle line:84%
and they're driving some of
these rebellious factions

00:22:33.890 --> 00:22:37.650 align:middle line:84%
into Central Tibet
and into Lhasa.

00:22:37.650 --> 00:22:41.840 align:middle line:84%
So all of a sudden, you have
thousands of Kham warriors

00:22:41.840 --> 00:22:46.002 align:middle line:84%
who had been fighting Tibet,
and they escape to Lhasa.

00:22:46.002 --> 00:22:47.960 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Well, they did
end up coming in handy

00:22:47.960 --> 00:22:51.880 align:middle line:84%
in an attempt to save
Lhasa at one point, right?

00:22:51.880 --> 00:22:52.680 align:middle line:90%
>> RICE: Yeah.

00:22:52.680 --> 00:22:54.540 align:middle line:84%
They were part of
that rebellion.

00:22:54.540 --> 00:22:55.490 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:22:55.490 --> 00:22:57.720 align:middle line:90%
There were armed people there.

00:22:57.720 --> 00:22:59.200 align:middle line:90%
And let's get into--

00:22:59.200 --> 00:23:02.280 align:middle line:84%
So Tenzin, we're not going to be
able to follow the whole story.

00:23:02.280 --> 00:23:05.480 align:middle line:84%
So let's get into where
Tenzin is at this point

00:23:05.480 --> 00:23:08.840 align:middle line:84%
and then get into the
Dalai Lama himself and talk

00:23:08.840 --> 00:23:10.290 align:middle line:90%
about the way he got out.

00:23:10.290 --> 00:23:12.650 align:middle line:84%
A lot of people don't know
how he got out of there.

00:23:12.650 --> 00:23:15.360 align:middle line:84%
>>COLE: Well, Tenzin was
in at Menri Monastery,

00:23:15.360 --> 00:23:17.070 align:middle line:90%
which is outside of Lhasa.

00:23:17.070 --> 00:23:20.820 align:middle line:84%
It's about probably
five or six-hour drive

00:23:20.820 --> 00:23:22.930 align:middle line:90%
if you were driving it nowadays.

00:23:22.930 --> 00:23:25.860 align:middle line:84%
So at that point,
it was probably

00:23:25.860 --> 00:23:27.670 align:middle line:90%
three-day walk over there.

00:23:27.670 --> 00:23:31.140 align:middle line:84%
He was there, and he kept
hearing all these stories

00:23:31.140 --> 00:23:35.760 align:middle line:84%
and seeing incidences of
the Chinese and neighboring

00:23:35.760 --> 00:23:40.350 align:middle line:84%
monasteries where they
were doing education things

00:23:40.350 --> 00:23:43.308 align:middle line:84%
and asking people to renounce
their Lamas and so forth.

00:23:43.308 --> 00:23:45.600 align:middle line:84%
And he just didn't want to
have anything to do with it.

00:23:45.600 --> 00:23:49.330 align:middle line:84%
So he left and went to,
for a number of reasons,

00:23:49.330 --> 00:23:53.640 align:middle line:84%
including that, to a monastery
up in the remote Changtang.

00:23:53.640 --> 00:24:01.900 align:middle line:84%
And so when the rebellion in
Lhasa occurred in March of 1959,

00:24:01.900 --> 00:24:06.280 align:middle line:84%
he was up on the Changtang,
quite a ways away from there.

00:24:06.280 --> 00:24:14.490 align:middle line:84%
And at that point,
there was a number

00:24:14.490 --> 00:24:18.630 align:middle line:84%
of incidences that occurred
that caused the people of Lhasa

00:24:18.630 --> 00:24:21.090 align:middle line:84%
to fear for the
Dalai Lama's safety.

00:24:21.090 --> 00:24:23.410 align:middle line:10%
And they went to
his summer palace,

00:24:23.410 --> 00:24:27.630 align:middle line:10%
where he was staying, and
surrounded the entire summer

00:24:27.630 --> 00:24:33.390 align:middle line:10%
palace, built ditches and
armed themselves with shovels

00:24:33.390 --> 00:24:34.830 align:middle line:10%
and whatever they could find--

00:24:34.830 --> 00:24:35.610 align:middle line:10%
>>REGINA: Fight to the death.

00:24:35.610 --> 00:24:36.410 align:middle line:90%
>>COLE: Yes.

00:24:36.410 --> 00:24:43.498 align:middle line:84%
And so he left at that point,
in the middle of all of this--

00:24:43.498 --> 00:24:45.540 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: You're saying
Tenzin or the Dalai Lama?

00:24:45.540 --> 00:24:46.930 align:middle line:90%
>>COLE: The Dalai Lama.

00:24:46.930 --> 00:24:49.780 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: He had to escape
dressed as a soldier,

00:24:49.780 --> 00:24:50.590 align:middle line:90%
as I recall.

00:24:50.590 --> 00:24:51.470 align:middle line:90%
>>COLE: Yes.

00:24:51.470 --> 00:24:52.270 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

00:24:52.270 --> 00:24:55.030 align:middle line:84%
He dressed up and
took his glasses off,

00:24:55.030 --> 00:24:56.890 align:middle line:84%
so that people
couldn't recognize him,

00:24:56.890 --> 00:25:01.290 align:middle line:84%
separated from his entourage and
rode a donkey out a horse out.

00:25:01.290 --> 00:25:05.010 align:middle line:84%
Some of the Kham warriors
that Harvey was talking about

00:25:05.010 --> 00:25:10.530 align:middle line:84%
were elicited to
be his companions

00:25:10.530 --> 00:25:12.540 align:middle line:90%
and to safety him out.

00:25:12.540 --> 00:25:16.920 align:middle line:84%
So he left on one
day, and the next day,

00:25:16.920 --> 00:25:21.030 align:middle line:84%
by mistake or happenstance,
but anyway, it was inevitable

00:25:21.030 --> 00:25:22.390 align:middle line:90%
that this was going to happen.

00:25:22.390 --> 00:25:28.030 align:middle line:84%
And the clash began between
the Tibetans and the army--

00:25:28.030 --> 00:25:30.030 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And the Tibetans
didn't have a chance.

00:25:30.030 --> 00:25:31.350 align:middle line:90%
>>COLE: They never had a chance.

00:25:31.350 --> 00:25:32.808 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And these
people, as they

00:25:32.808 --> 00:25:35.850 align:middle line:84%
were fleeing, including Tenzin,
going into this remote area,

00:25:35.850 --> 00:25:38.040 align:middle line:84%
I mean, ultimately
crossing the Himalayas.

00:25:38.040 --> 00:25:40.820 align:middle line:84%
I mean, just stunning
journeys even

00:25:40.820 --> 00:25:44.660 align:middle line:84%
in the winter with
handmade wool boots

00:25:44.660 --> 00:25:48.980 align:middle line:84%
on, for example, with a
little bag of some barley

00:25:48.980 --> 00:25:50.817 align:middle line:90%
paste and a little yak butter.

00:25:50.817 --> 00:25:52.400 align:middle line:84%
And you're lucky if
you even had a yak

00:25:52.400 --> 00:25:53.990 align:middle line:90%
to carry something for you.

00:25:53.990 --> 00:25:58.300 align:middle line:84%
And hiking at 20,000 with so
little to keep your reserves

00:25:58.300 --> 00:25:59.100 align:middle line:90%
going.

00:25:59.100 --> 00:26:02.990 align:middle line:84%
So the Tibetans
genetically actually

00:26:02.990 --> 00:26:06.020 align:middle line:84%
have become quite
genetically different

00:26:06.020 --> 00:26:07.890 align:middle line:90%
in their ability to survive.

00:26:07.890 --> 00:26:10.790 align:middle line:10%
>>COLE: They've recently found a
gene that the Tibetans have that

00:26:10.790 --> 00:26:13.820 align:middle line:10%
allow them to carry more
oxygen, so it allows

00:26:13.820 --> 00:26:15.600 align:middle line:10%
them to live at the altitudes.

00:26:15.600 --> 00:26:17.370 align:middle line:90%
Lhasa is at 12.5.

00:26:17.370 --> 00:26:21.000 align:middle line:84%
Changtang starts at 15
and goes up from there.

00:26:21.000 --> 00:26:26.410 align:middle line:84%
It's an extremely harsh and
very interesting environment.

00:26:26.410 --> 00:26:31.110 align:middle line:84%
So I got altitude
sickness when I was there,

00:26:31.110 --> 00:26:33.990 align:middle line:84%
and it delayed our ability
to go to a lot of places

00:26:33.990 --> 00:26:35.920 align:middle line:84%
while I was
recovering from that.

00:26:35.920 --> 00:26:38.530 align:middle line:90%
But that's just an aside.

00:26:38.530 --> 00:26:40.800 align:middle line:84%
If you ever get a chance
to go, just be sure

00:26:40.800 --> 00:26:45.750 align:middle line:84%
you're prepared or ready to
deal with altitude sickness

00:26:45.750 --> 00:26:49.500 align:middle line:90%
because it's a big deal there.

00:26:49.500 --> 00:26:52.140 align:middle line:10%
But anyway, the journey,
you're absolutely

00:26:52.140 --> 00:26:54.750 align:middle line:10%
right in that journeys that
they faced were amazing.

00:26:54.750 --> 00:26:56.444 align:middle line:90%
And they had to walk everywhere.

00:26:56.444 --> 00:26:59.730 align:middle line:90%


00:26:59.730 --> 00:27:05.470 align:middle line:84%
Now when Tenzin was up on
the Changtang, all of this,

00:27:05.470 --> 00:27:08.780 align:middle line:84%
remember the battle, this
has sort of spread down here.

00:27:08.780 --> 00:27:11.650 align:middle line:84%
And so it got to Lhasa,
and then he was up here.

00:27:11.650 --> 00:27:14.530 align:middle line:84%
In the middle of
all of this, the CIA

00:27:14.530 --> 00:27:20.690 align:middle line:84%
decides that they want to help
the Tibetans harass the Chinese.

00:27:20.690 --> 00:27:27.100 align:middle line:84%
So they recruited
some Tibetans to train

00:27:27.100 --> 00:27:30.160 align:middle line:84%
and then dropped back
into Tibet with arms.

00:27:30.160 --> 00:27:34.520 align:middle line:84%
Some of that is occurring up
in the area where Tenzin was.

00:27:34.520 --> 00:27:40.960 align:middle line:84%
So when it became apparent that
the Chinese were moving all

00:27:40.960 --> 00:27:44.720 align:middle line:84%
through Tibet to
squash the monasteries,

00:27:44.720 --> 00:27:46.910 align:middle line:90%
Tenzin decided to leave.

00:27:46.910 --> 00:27:49.360 align:middle line:84%
And when he did
that, he happened

00:27:49.360 --> 00:27:53.890 align:middle line:84%
to be at the same time as one
of the warlords that we think

00:27:53.890 --> 00:27:56.380 align:middle line:90%
was receiving arms from the CIA.

00:27:56.380 --> 00:27:58.750 align:middle line:84%
So the Chinese had
congregated there

00:27:58.750 --> 00:28:03.280 align:middle line:84%
in order to counter that
information, and that arms drop,

00:28:03.280 --> 00:28:04.610 align:middle line:90%
and that warlord.

00:28:04.610 --> 00:28:06.720 align:middle line:90%
And he got caught up in that--

00:28:06.720 --> 00:28:08.720 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Well, he was
in the foot, as I recall.

00:28:08.720 --> 00:28:09.470 align:middle line:90%
>>COLE: In the leg.

00:28:09.470 --> 00:28:10.040 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: In the leg.

00:28:10.040 --> 00:28:11.332 align:middle line:90%
>>COLE: He got shot in the leg.

00:28:11.332 --> 00:28:12.800 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And had
to keep walking.

00:28:12.800 --> 00:28:16.427 align:middle line:84%
>>COLE: Well,
actually, the Chinese

00:28:16.427 --> 00:28:18.010 align:middle line:84%
were walking through
his camp and were

00:28:18.010 --> 00:28:19.160 align:middle line:90%
going to finish him off.

00:28:19.160 --> 00:28:21.530 align:middle line:84%
And one said, don't bother,
he's going to die anyway.

00:28:21.530 --> 00:28:24.080 align:middle line:84%
That's how badly the
wound was in his leg.

00:28:24.080 --> 00:28:27.280 align:middle line:90%
And he survived that.

00:28:27.280 --> 00:28:34.660 align:middle line:84%
And was about three weeks in the
wilderness with people helping

00:28:34.660 --> 00:28:42.130 align:middle line:84%
him before he ended up in a
camp for Tibetans that was run

00:28:42.130 --> 00:28:44.650 align:middle line:90%
by Tibetans for the Chinese.

00:28:44.650 --> 00:28:47.680 align:middle line:84%
And he stayed there
for 10 months.

00:28:47.680 --> 00:28:49.930 align:middle line:84%
And during that time,
he was able to heal

00:28:49.930 --> 00:28:51.370 align:middle line:90%
enough to be able to walk out.

00:28:51.370 --> 00:28:52.780 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And then
start walking again.

00:28:52.780 --> 00:28:54.080 align:middle line:84%
>>COLE: And then to
start walking again.

00:28:54.080 --> 00:28:55.190 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And part
of this history

00:28:55.190 --> 00:28:56.980 align:middle line:84%
too is that the
Dalai Lama's brother

00:28:56.980 --> 00:28:59.300 align:middle line:90%
was recruited by the CIA.

00:28:59.300 --> 00:29:01.070 align:middle line:90%
>>COLE: Yes.

00:29:01.070 --> 00:29:03.370 align:middle line:84%
The Dalai Lama's brother
is one of the ones that

00:29:03.370 --> 00:29:07.910 align:middle line:84%
helped to select the Tibetans
that were used in this program

00:29:07.910 --> 00:29:11.570 align:middle line:84%
to train and then drop
back in as guerrillas.

00:29:11.570 --> 00:29:15.920 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: But in the end, the US
didn't do anything to help them.

00:29:15.920 --> 00:29:19.610 align:middle line:84%
You said in the book, they
actually made things worse.

00:29:19.610 --> 00:29:25.550 align:middle line:84%
>> RICE: They gave the Tibetans
this false sense that the US

00:29:25.550 --> 00:29:27.800 align:middle line:90%
might come to help them.

00:29:27.800 --> 00:29:30.370 align:middle line:90%
And they let them--

00:29:30.370 --> 00:29:33.580 align:middle line:90%
the CIA let them think that.

00:29:33.580 --> 00:29:37.143 align:middle line:84%
But really, what they
wanted was just to annoy--

00:29:37.143 --> 00:29:38.060 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: The Chinese.

00:29:38.060 --> 00:29:39.020 align:middle line:90%
>> RICE: --the Chinese.

00:29:39.020 --> 00:29:43.030 align:middle line:84%
And they were never going
to really put the resources

00:29:43.030 --> 00:29:46.370 align:middle line:84%
in there necessary to help the
Chinese get their country back,

00:29:46.370 --> 00:29:49.070 align:middle line:84%
and that the Tibetans
were counting on that.

00:29:49.070 --> 00:29:52.880 align:middle line:84%
And so in the end, they
were really disappointed,

00:29:52.880 --> 00:29:55.960 align:middle line:84%
and there's still
bitterness about that.

00:29:55.960 --> 00:29:58.485 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: You can
understand feeling betrayed.

00:29:58.485 --> 00:30:00.290 align:middle line:84%
>>COLE: Even the
people we talked to--

00:30:00.290 --> 00:30:04.120 align:middle line:84%
we were fortunate to be able to
talk with one of the CIA guys

00:30:04.120 --> 00:30:06.080 align:middle line:84%
who worked with
them on the program.

00:30:06.080 --> 00:30:09.190 align:middle line:84%
And he himself was
bitter about it

00:30:09.190 --> 00:30:12.860 align:middle line:84%
because he came to love
the Tibetans so much.

00:30:12.860 --> 00:30:14.970 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So now
we have a story.

00:30:14.970 --> 00:30:17.592 align:middle line:84%
So Tenzin, and
we'll have to move

00:30:17.592 --> 00:30:19.050 align:middle line:84%
through the story
a little bit now.

00:30:19.050 --> 00:30:22.080 align:middle line:90%
So Tenzin ultimately survives.

00:30:22.080 --> 00:30:25.380 align:middle line:84%
Ultimately, they meet a man,
he and the two other characters

00:30:25.380 --> 00:30:26.180 align:middle line:90%
with them--

00:30:26.180 --> 00:30:27.980 align:middle line:84%
>>COLE: It's a
miracle he survives.

00:30:27.980 --> 00:30:29.155 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah, it's crazy.

00:30:29.155 --> 00:30:31.850 align:middle line:84%
>>COLE: There are
multiple incidences

00:30:31.850 --> 00:30:34.695 align:middle line:84%
of miracles that occurred
that allowed him to survive.

00:30:34.695 --> 00:30:36.320 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Like a body
of water freezing

00:30:36.320 --> 00:30:37.910 align:middle line:84%
over when it shouldn't
have, just when

00:30:37.910 --> 00:30:40.470 align:middle line:84%
he needed for his survival
to get across that river.

00:30:40.470 --> 00:30:41.270 align:middle line:90%
>>COLE: Yes.

00:30:41.270 --> 00:30:44.870 align:middle line:84%
Like a man who was
trying to escape--

00:30:44.870 --> 00:30:47.930 align:middle line:84%
when he was left to die
by a creek, and a man who

00:30:47.930 --> 00:30:51.410 align:middle line:84%
was trying to escape himself
came along, and found him,

00:30:51.410 --> 00:30:54.890 align:middle line:84%
and stopped, and stayed
there for a couple of weeks

00:30:54.890 --> 00:30:57.240 align:middle line:90%
to nurse him.

00:30:57.240 --> 00:30:58.530 align:middle line:90%
>> RICE: Saved his life.

00:30:58.530 --> 00:30:58.850 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:30:58.850 --> 00:30:59.650 align:middle line:90%
Repeatedly.

00:30:59.650 --> 00:31:01.640 align:middle line:84%
>>COLE: It was like
the protectors,

00:31:01.640 --> 00:31:03.950 align:middle line:84%
the Bon protectors
saved Yongdzin

00:31:03.950 --> 00:31:07.610 align:middle line:84%
because they knew he
was needed to save Bon.

00:31:07.610 --> 00:31:10.100 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So they go
through all of this,

00:31:10.100 --> 00:31:14.220 align:middle line:84%
and ultimately there
comes a day now.

00:31:14.220 --> 00:31:17.260 align:middle line:84%
Where did they land
before, what's his name,

00:31:17.260 --> 00:31:22.380 align:middle line:84%
David Snellgrove Where were
when David Snellgrove found

00:31:22.380 --> 00:31:28.418 align:middle line:84%
them, a Brit, these three monks,
Tenzin and the two others?

00:31:28.418 --> 00:31:30.210 align:middle line:84%
>>COLE: Essentially
they were in Kathmandu.

00:31:30.210 --> 00:31:31.160 align:middle line:90%
>> RICE: Yeah.

00:31:31.160 --> 00:31:37.940 align:middle line:84%
Two of the monks, Samten
Karmay and Sangye Tenzin,

00:31:37.940 --> 00:31:40.580 align:middle line:84%
had wanted to preserve--
they're worried

00:31:40.580 --> 00:31:43.640 align:middle line:90%
about losing this Bon canon.

00:31:43.640 --> 00:31:47.710 align:middle line:84%
And they had starting a
printing operation in New Delhi.

00:31:47.710 --> 00:31:49.130 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:31:49.130 --> 00:31:53.390 align:middle line:84%
>> RICE: And so Samten stayed
there to oversee the printing

00:31:53.390 --> 00:32:01.700 align:middle line:84%
operation while Sangye went up
into Dolpo, which is a Tibetan--

00:32:01.700 --> 00:32:05.630 align:middle line:84%
it's ethnically Tibetan,
but it's part of Nepal

00:32:05.630 --> 00:32:07.070 align:middle line:84%
because a couple
of hundred years

00:32:07.070 --> 00:32:09.830 align:middle line:84%
before that, Nepal
a war with Tibet

00:32:09.830 --> 00:32:11.960 align:middle line:84%
and had conquered
that territory,

00:32:11.960 --> 00:32:16.890 align:middle line:84%
but it remains to this
day, ethnically Tibetan.

00:32:16.890 --> 00:32:21.420 align:middle line:84%
And so there were Bon
monasteries up there.

00:32:21.420 --> 00:32:27.590 align:middle line:84%
And so he went there
to get these writings,

00:32:27.590 --> 00:32:30.630 align:middle line:90%
and he wanted to reproduce them.

00:32:30.630 --> 00:32:32.990 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: To save the
religion, to write it all down,

00:32:32.990 --> 00:32:34.323 align:middle line:90%
now to make it in printed forms.

00:32:34.323 --> 00:32:37.140 align:middle line:84%
>> RICE: And that's where, and
Snellgrove, just coincidentally,

00:32:37.140 --> 00:32:41.240 align:middle line:84%
he had become interested in
Bon, and he was in that region

00:32:41.240 --> 00:32:43.700 align:middle line:84%
because he knew there
were Bonpos up there.

00:32:43.700 --> 00:32:51.360 align:middle line:84%
And there was a
Rockefeller Grant,

00:32:51.360 --> 00:32:55.090 align:middle line:84%
and he had gotten
quite a bit of money.

00:32:55.090 --> 00:32:58.110 align:middle line:84%
And then he had
to use that money

00:32:58.110 --> 00:33:04.140 align:middle line:84%
to find Tibetans and then take
them to a university in Europe.

00:33:04.140 --> 00:33:06.930 align:middle line:90%


00:33:06.930 --> 00:33:09.220 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: That was interesting.

00:33:09.220 --> 00:33:17.520 align:middle line:84%
>> RICE: And so he ran into
Tenzin, this was Sangye Tenzin.

00:33:17.520 --> 00:33:19.980 align:middle line:84%
And he ran into him,
and he was really

00:33:19.980 --> 00:33:23.200 align:middle line:84%
impressed by his intellect
and his knowledge.

00:33:23.200 --> 00:33:25.780 align:middle line:84%
And he says, this is a guy
I want to take with me.

00:33:25.780 --> 00:33:32.500 align:middle line:84%
So he arranged to
meet him in Kathmandu.

00:33:32.500 --> 00:33:35.520 align:middle line:84%
So when Snellgrove
goes there to meet him,

00:33:35.520 --> 00:33:40.380 align:middle line:84%
Sangye had gone there and left
before Snellgrove got there,

00:33:40.380 --> 00:33:42.930 align:middle line:90%
but he ran into Tenzin Namdak.

00:33:42.930 --> 00:33:44.790 align:middle line:90%
And he starts talking to him.

00:33:44.790 --> 00:33:48.450 align:middle line:84%
And he is just
wowed by this guy.

00:33:48.450 --> 00:33:50.820 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: By his
knowledge, yeah.

00:33:50.820 --> 00:33:53.890 align:middle line:84%
Well, this guy, David Snellgrove
had learned the language.

00:33:53.890 --> 00:33:56.970 align:middle line:84%
I mean, he was very
committed to understanding

00:33:56.970 --> 00:34:00.620 align:middle line:84%
Buddhism, Tibetan Buddhism,
and the Bon, Bonpo language

00:34:00.620 --> 00:34:01.420 align:middle line:90%
and such.

00:34:01.420 --> 00:34:05.460 align:middle line:84%
So he takes them, three
of them, to London.

00:34:05.460 --> 00:34:08.770 align:middle line:84%
I mean, it's kind of the stuff
you could make a movie about.

00:34:08.770 --> 00:34:12.420 align:middle line:84%
These three guys that have
been on foot their whole lives,

00:34:12.420 --> 00:34:14.850 align:middle line:84%
lived on yak butter
and barley paste,

00:34:14.850 --> 00:34:17.000 align:middle line:90%
and now they're in London.

00:34:17.000 --> 00:34:17.870 align:middle line:90%
Oh, my god.

00:34:17.870 --> 00:34:19.270 align:middle line:90%
It was nearly comical.

00:34:19.270 --> 00:34:22.330 align:middle line:84%
Because he wants to
be able to inculcate

00:34:22.330 --> 00:34:24.790 align:middle line:84%
their knowledge into
the university system

00:34:24.790 --> 00:34:27.530 align:middle line:84%
there and preserve
this religion.

00:34:27.530 --> 00:34:30.489 align:middle line:84%
But you've got to deal with
these three young guys who

00:34:30.489 --> 00:34:32.583 align:middle line:84%
know nothing about
the outside world.

00:34:32.583 --> 00:34:34.000 align:middle line:84%
>>COLE: Not only
that, but they're

00:34:34.000 --> 00:34:35.600 align:middle line:90%
all independent and headstrong.

00:34:35.600 --> 00:34:37.000 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:34:37.000 --> 00:34:38.679 align:middle line:90%
And they would just disappear.

00:34:38.679 --> 00:34:40.143 align:middle line:84%
They'd just take
off and disappear,

00:34:40.143 --> 00:34:41.560 align:middle line:84%
and he had no idea
where they were

00:34:41.560 --> 00:34:43.909 align:middle line:84%
because they were used to
being hemmed in and going by--

00:34:43.909 --> 00:34:47.420 align:middle line:84%
They didn't have a
day runner in the day.

00:34:47.420 --> 00:34:50.659 align:middle line:84%
>> RICE: And the story about
their cultures are so different,

00:34:50.659 --> 00:34:53.189 align:middle line:84%
so they had never worn pants
because they don't wear pants

00:34:53.189 --> 00:34:53.989 align:middle line:90%
in Tibet.

00:34:53.989 --> 00:35:00.610 align:middle line:84%
And so Snellgrove has
these suits made for them.

00:35:00.610 --> 00:35:05.290 align:middle line:84%
And so Tenzin namdak
gets a pair of pants.

00:35:05.290 --> 00:35:09.410 align:middle line:84%
And he looks at them, and
he sees where the zipper is.

00:35:09.410 --> 00:35:10.760 align:middle line:90%
So he puts it on backwards.

00:35:10.760 --> 00:35:13.240 align:middle line:90%
He's thinking it's for the back.

00:35:13.240 --> 00:35:14.380 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Just in case.

00:35:14.380 --> 00:35:18.010 align:middle line:84%
There are things that
have to be done there.

00:35:18.010 --> 00:35:20.270 align:middle line:84%
So they've got their
pants on backward.

00:35:20.270 --> 00:35:23.110 align:middle line:84%
They're looking at
food, a panoply of food

00:35:23.110 --> 00:35:24.530 align:middle line:90%
they can't even imagine.

00:35:24.530 --> 00:35:27.740 align:middle line:84%
And I don't know if they're very
comfortable eating a lot of it.

00:35:27.740 --> 00:35:29.830 align:middle line:84%
How did their bodies
do with the food

00:35:29.830 --> 00:35:32.100 align:middle line:90%
that was put in front of them?

00:35:32.100 --> 00:35:33.090 align:middle line:90%
Did they ever say--

00:35:33.090 --> 00:35:33.820 align:middle line:90%
>>COLE: I think they did OK.

00:35:33.820 --> 00:35:34.530 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Did they do OK?

00:35:34.530 --> 00:35:35.320 align:middle line:90%
>>COLE: I think they did OK.

00:35:35.320 --> 00:35:37.320 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: They only ever
eaten like three things.

00:35:37.320 --> 00:35:38.778 align:middle line:84%
>>COLE: Where they
ran into trouble

00:35:38.778 --> 00:35:42.810 align:middle line:84%
was when they originally came
out of Tibet and went into,

00:35:42.810 --> 00:35:51.060 align:middle line:84%
Samten Karmay and Sangye Tenzin
ended up in refugee camps.

00:35:51.060 --> 00:35:54.220 align:middle line:84%
And they were in India,
which is extremely hot.

00:35:54.220 --> 00:35:58.410 align:middle line:84%
So they went from 30
degrees to 120 degrees,

00:35:58.410 --> 00:36:04.420 align:middle line:84%
and rice instead of barley,
and dal instead of meat.

00:36:04.420 --> 00:36:08.710 align:middle line:84%
And a lot of them, there was a
lot of dysentery in the camps.

00:36:08.710 --> 00:36:11.440 align:middle line:84%
And so that's where
they got sick.

00:36:11.440 --> 00:36:14.310 align:middle line:84%
And a lot of Tibetans, there
was a number of Tibetans

00:36:14.310 --> 00:36:19.000 align:middle line:84%
that died in the refugee
camps from the circumstances.

00:36:19.000 --> 00:36:23.080 align:middle line:84%
As much as India and
Nepal helped the refugees,

00:36:23.080 --> 00:36:26.620 align:middle line:84%
there was just an overwhelming
situation at the time.

00:36:26.620 --> 00:36:28.590 align:middle line:84%
And so there was a
number of Tibetans

00:36:28.590 --> 00:36:31.140 align:middle line:84%
that lost their lives,
even after they had crossed

00:36:31.140 --> 00:36:33.660 align:middle line:84%
the Himalayas, lost their
lives in the refugee

00:36:33.660 --> 00:36:36.967 align:middle line:84%
camps due to dysentery
and other conditions.

00:36:36.967 --> 00:36:38.550 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Well, these
guys got through

00:36:38.550 --> 00:36:41.490 align:middle line:84%
and were able to, I guess,
ultimately have scones and tea

00:36:41.490 --> 00:36:43.330 align:middle line:90%
in London.

00:36:43.330 --> 00:36:44.490 align:middle line:90%
So they did.

00:36:44.490 --> 00:36:48.120 align:middle line:84%
They worked very
hard with David, to--

00:36:48.120 --> 00:36:53.040 align:middle line:84%
David Snellgrove, and they were
able to share their knowledge

00:36:53.040 --> 00:36:57.660 align:middle line:84%
and create a course of study
in essence for Snellgrove

00:36:57.660 --> 00:36:59.230 align:middle line:84%
and the university
system in England.

00:36:59.230 --> 00:37:00.030 align:middle line:90%
>>COLE: Yes.

00:37:00.030 --> 00:37:03.570 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And then each one of
them kind of went their own way

00:37:03.570 --> 00:37:04.960 align:middle line:90%
and had their own projects.

00:37:04.960 --> 00:37:06.810 align:middle line:84%
And so let's start
bringing us up

00:37:06.810 --> 00:37:09.330 align:middle line:84%
to a little bit more modern
times of what happened

00:37:09.330 --> 00:37:11.710 align:middle line:90%
as these young men grew up.

00:37:11.710 --> 00:37:13.720 align:middle line:90%
Where did Tenzin end up?

00:37:13.720 --> 00:37:15.910 align:middle line:90%
>>COLE: Tenzin went back.

00:37:15.910 --> 00:37:20.460 align:middle line:84%
He felt like his responsibility
was with the Bonpo community.

00:37:20.460 --> 00:37:23.190 align:middle line:84%
And in fact, he
corresponded with them

00:37:23.190 --> 00:37:26.980 align:middle line:84%
while he was in Europe, and
his main concern was for them.

00:37:26.980 --> 00:37:29.730 align:middle line:84%
When he went back to
India, he went by boat

00:37:29.730 --> 00:37:31.230 align:middle line:90%
because he gets air sick.

00:37:31.230 --> 00:37:34.450 align:middle line:84%
He went back by boat and took
a large crate full of things

00:37:34.450 --> 00:37:36.610 align:middle line:84%
that he thought people--
clothes and other things

00:37:36.610 --> 00:37:39.950 align:middle line:84%
that he thought people
would be helpful for them.

00:37:39.950 --> 00:37:42.670 align:middle line:84%
And then when he
got back, he set

00:37:42.670 --> 00:37:46.990 align:middle line:84%
about trying to find a
location for a new village

00:37:46.990 --> 00:37:50.500 align:middle line:84%
where the Bonpos could gather
and be together as opposed

00:37:50.500 --> 00:37:54.010 align:middle line:84%
to being scattered among all of
the other Tibetan communities

00:37:54.010 --> 00:37:55.070 align:middle line:90%
around.

00:37:55.070 --> 00:37:58.400 align:middle line:84%
So he set about
making that happen.

00:37:58.400 --> 00:37:59.200 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:37:59.200 --> 00:38:00.380 align:middle line:90%
And he was successful.

00:38:00.380 --> 00:38:01.180 align:middle line:90%
>>COLE: Yes.

00:38:01.180 --> 00:38:05.030 align:middle line:84%
>> RICE: And you have to
remember that when the Bonpos,

00:38:05.030 --> 00:38:07.960 align:middle line:84%
that is the Indian government
and the Nepalese government

00:38:07.960 --> 00:38:11.000 align:middle line:84%
for that matter, they didn't
really know anything about Bon.

00:38:11.000 --> 00:38:15.610 align:middle line:84%
So they just thought that
Tibetans were Buddhists.

00:38:15.610 --> 00:38:19.430 align:middle line:84%
And so there was no recognition
of this separate religion.

00:38:19.430 --> 00:38:25.060 align:middle line:84%
And so all of the grants,
and money, and assistance

00:38:25.060 --> 00:38:28.460 align:middle line:90%
was distributed by Buddhists.

00:38:28.460 --> 00:38:33.230 align:middle line:10%
And so Bonpos ended up
being on, for instance,

00:38:33.230 --> 00:38:36.520 align:middle line:10%
like doing road work under--

00:38:36.520 --> 00:38:39.500 align:middle line:10%
that was, and their
boss was a Buddhist.

00:38:39.500 --> 00:38:44.140 align:middle line:84%
And sometimes, they would make
them recite Buddhist prayers

00:38:44.140 --> 00:38:46.930 align:middle line:84%
because they sort of looked
down their noses, at Bonpos--

00:38:46.930 --> 00:38:48.930 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: They thought
of them as an underclass.

00:38:48.930 --> 00:38:54.310 align:middle line:84%
>> RICE: And so there's a real
worry that Bonpos would be

00:38:54.310 --> 00:39:00.790 align:middle line:84%
dispersed and start losing
their religion and their culture

00:39:00.790 --> 00:39:06.170 align:middle line:84%
because there were no
monasteries there for them.

00:39:06.170 --> 00:39:10.810 align:middle line:84%
And so that's one
reason that Tenzin

00:39:10.810 --> 00:39:16.240 align:middle line:84%
felt it was really necessary
to get some land and get--

00:39:16.240 --> 00:39:18.370 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Take up a land
and create the community.

00:39:18.370 --> 00:39:21.220 align:middle line:84%
>> RICE: So that bonpos
would have a place to look

00:39:21.220 --> 00:39:25.700 align:middle line:84%
to in a place where their
culture was preserved.

00:39:25.700 --> 00:39:28.540 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And all along the
way, from the very beginning

00:39:28.540 --> 00:39:30.820 align:middle line:84%
to some potential
enemies, they had

00:39:30.820 --> 00:39:33.770 align:middle line:84%
to trick people along the
way as to their Bon identity

00:39:33.770 --> 00:39:36.890 align:middle line:84%
just to survive in the early
days fleeing from the Chinese.

00:39:36.890 --> 00:39:40.580 align:middle line:84%
But everyone experienced
them as just the kindest,

00:39:40.580 --> 00:39:42.320 align:middle line:90%
most polite people.

00:39:42.320 --> 00:39:44.560 align:middle line:84%
Even when they got
to England, they

00:39:44.560 --> 00:39:48.220 align:middle line:84%
were just so kind, and helpful,
and jump up and do the dishes

00:39:48.220 --> 00:39:50.660 align:middle line:90%
and whatever they could do.

00:39:50.660 --> 00:39:51.887 align:middle line:90%
So kind and polite.

00:39:51.887 --> 00:39:52.970 align:middle line:90%
But they did it their way.

00:39:52.970 --> 00:39:54.170 align:middle line:90%
You don't use soap.

00:39:54.170 --> 00:39:56.660 align:middle line:84%
You use your hand
to clean the dishes.

00:39:56.660 --> 00:39:58.610 align:middle line:90%
That's how it's done properly.

00:39:58.610 --> 00:40:00.530 align:middle line:90%
You get some skin in the game.

00:40:00.530 --> 00:40:04.390 align:middle line:84%
And just this reflection
of their deep, deep beliefs

00:40:04.390 --> 00:40:06.820 align:middle line:84%
of generosity and
kindness continued

00:40:06.820 --> 00:40:07.780 align:middle line:90%
throughout their lives.

00:40:07.780 --> 00:40:10.880 align:middle line:84%
Now we only have a
few minutes left.

00:40:10.880 --> 00:40:12.020 align:middle line:90%
So that's flown.

00:40:12.020 --> 00:40:14.670 align:middle line:84%
So now, we come
to modern history.

00:40:14.670 --> 00:40:15.470 align:middle line:90%
Modern times.

00:40:15.470 --> 00:40:18.970 align:middle line:84%
I mentioned, spoiler
alert, in the beginning,

00:40:18.970 --> 00:40:22.180 align:middle line:90%
Tenzin will be 100 in February.

00:40:22.180 --> 00:40:27.440 align:middle line:84%
So the Bon community that
he established is well?

00:40:27.440 --> 00:40:29.030 align:middle line:90%
>>COLE: Yes, it's doing well.

00:40:29.030 --> 00:40:31.760 align:middle line:84%
Menri Monastery in
exile is in India.

00:40:31.760 --> 00:40:35.600 align:middle line:84%
And it is the seat of
Bon in the world now.

00:40:35.600 --> 00:40:40.830 align:middle line:10%
And so now, Tenzin established
a second monastery in Kathmandu,

00:40:40.830 --> 00:40:43.530 align:middle line:10%
and it is called
Triten Norbutse,

00:40:43.530 --> 00:40:45.750 align:middle line:10%
and it is training
new monks as well.

00:40:45.750 --> 00:40:52.400 align:middle line:84%
There's a nunnery in Menri,
which now provides women

00:40:52.400 --> 00:40:55.800 align:middle line:84%
with the ability to
not only become a nun

00:40:55.800 --> 00:40:58.250 align:middle line:90%
but also to get a Geshe degree.

00:40:58.250 --> 00:40:59.697 align:middle line:90%
So they're called Geshemas.

00:40:59.697 --> 00:41:00.530 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Wonderful.

00:41:00.530 --> 00:41:01.530 align:middle line:90%
>>COLE: Yes, it is.

00:41:01.530 --> 00:41:04.700 align:middle line:84%
And so they've now graduated,
I think, four or five classes

00:41:04.700 --> 00:41:07.040 align:middle line:90%
of Geshemas.

00:41:07.040 --> 00:41:15.080 align:middle line:10%
And then so Sangye Tenzin,
who had gone to London

00:41:15.080 --> 00:41:18.180 align:middle line:10%
and was part of trying to get
the canon built and everything,

00:41:18.180 --> 00:41:21.020 align:middle line:10%
he became the head
of the Bon tradition

00:41:21.020 --> 00:41:22.560 align:middle line:10%
there at Menri Monastery.

00:41:22.560 --> 00:41:25.550 align:middle line:10%
He passed away in 2017.

00:41:25.550 --> 00:41:29.030 align:middle line:10%
Samten Karmay stayed
as an academic

00:41:29.030 --> 00:41:32.550 align:middle line:10%
and was the best
known Tibetologist

00:41:32.550 --> 00:41:37.380 align:middle line:10%
now in the world with his
work on both Bon and Tibet

00:41:37.380 --> 00:41:39.310 align:middle line:10%
scholarly studies.

00:41:39.310 --> 00:41:43.720 align:middle line:84%
And then Yongdzin has, besides
the monastery in Kathmandu,

00:41:43.720 --> 00:41:48.940 align:middle line:84%
he formed a retreat center
in France called Shenten,

00:41:48.940 --> 00:41:51.850 align:middle line:90%
and he has pretty much retired.

00:41:51.850 --> 00:41:57.630 align:middle line:84%
He lives in Kathmandu, there
at the monastery in Kathmandu.

00:41:57.630 --> 00:41:59.717 align:middle line:90%
And he'll be 100 next year.

00:41:59.717 --> 00:42:00.550 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: I love it.

00:42:00.550 --> 00:42:04.300 align:middle line:84%
And if you have to look at
the silver lining in anything,

00:42:04.300 --> 00:42:07.030 align:middle line:84%
if it weren't for the
aggression of the Chinese,

00:42:07.030 --> 00:42:09.250 align:middle line:84%
it wouldn't have
forced all this over.

00:42:09.250 --> 00:42:10.980 align:middle line:84%
It wouldn't have
forced them out.

00:42:10.980 --> 00:42:14.350 align:middle line:84%
David Snellgrove may never
have come in contact with them.

00:42:14.350 --> 00:42:16.260 align:middle line:84%
The rest of the
world may never know

00:42:16.260 --> 00:42:20.200 align:middle line:84%
about this incredibly
private culture,

00:42:20.200 --> 00:42:25.140 align:middle line:84%
up until that time, such a
primate culture, and ultimately

00:42:25.140 --> 00:42:26.600 align:middle line:90%
almost lost religion.

00:42:26.600 --> 00:42:29.880 align:middle line:90%


00:42:29.880 --> 00:42:32.860 align:middle line:84%
>>COLE: I don't know that it's
worth losing their country,

00:42:32.860 --> 00:42:36.390 align:middle line:84%
but I can say that it's a great
blessing for me to have been

00:42:36.390 --> 00:42:39.480 align:middle line:84%
and the rest of us who have
been touched by Bon, to be

00:42:39.480 --> 00:42:41.020 align:middle line:90%
able to have learned it.

00:42:41.020 --> 00:42:45.420 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And if one
goes to Lhasa today,

00:42:45.420 --> 00:42:47.380 align:middle line:84%
there will be people
following you.

00:42:47.380 --> 00:42:51.210 align:middle line:84%
You'll have Chinese patrol
people following you

00:42:51.210 --> 00:42:53.260 align:middle line:84%
around, make sure you
don't touch stuff too much.

00:42:53.260 --> 00:42:54.820 align:middle line:90%
I mean, isn't Lhasa--

00:42:54.820 --> 00:42:56.860 align:middle line:84%
a friend of mine
went there recently.

00:42:56.860 --> 00:42:59.500 align:middle line:84%
It has probably been 10
or 15 years ago, actually.

00:42:59.500 --> 00:43:02.100 align:middle line:84%
She just said it's
beautiful to be

00:43:02.100 --> 00:43:05.070 align:middle line:84%
able to see the antiquity
of it, but she didn't

00:43:05.070 --> 00:43:06.360 align:middle line:90%
feel all that comfortable.

00:43:06.360 --> 00:43:08.870 align:middle line:84%
>>COLE: Oh, It's terribly
intimidating when we were there.

00:43:08.870 --> 00:43:12.670 align:middle line:90%
It is a totalitarian state.

00:43:12.670 --> 00:43:14.140 align:middle line:90%
It is very intimidating.

00:43:14.140 --> 00:43:15.012 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:43:15.012 --> 00:43:16.470 align:middle line:84%
Because a lot of
people, oh, I want

00:43:16.470 --> 00:43:20.200 align:middle line:84%
to see the Potala, the
beautiful palace and all that.

00:43:20.200 --> 00:43:23.010 align:middle line:90%
Well, there's a price to pay.

00:43:23.010 --> 00:43:25.270 align:middle line:90%
OK, well, need not say more.

00:43:25.270 --> 00:43:28.530 align:middle line:84%
Well, thank you so much for
going on this great adventure

00:43:28.530 --> 00:43:32.220 align:middle line:84%
and sharing this little known
sect of religion with us

00:43:32.220 --> 00:43:34.480 align:middle line:90%
that I'd never heard of before.

00:43:34.480 --> 00:43:37.110 align:middle line:84%
And it's quite, we
couldn't go into it all.

00:43:37.110 --> 00:43:38.680 align:middle line:90%
Very exciting tale.

00:43:38.680 --> 00:43:41.430 align:middle line:84%
And all kinds of people
are shot and being dragged

00:43:41.430 --> 00:43:44.410 align:middle line:90%
by Lamas, which is just awful.

00:43:44.410 --> 00:43:46.420 align:middle line:90%
But they got through it somehow.

00:43:46.420 --> 00:43:47.650 align:middle line:90%
The religion survived.

00:43:47.650 --> 00:43:49.070 align:middle line:90%
>>COLE: Yes, fortunately.

00:43:49.070 --> 00:43:49.870 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: It did.

00:43:49.870 --> 00:43:51.037 align:middle line:90%
Thank you so much.

00:43:51.037 --> 00:43:52.370 align:middle line:90%
>>COLE: Thank you for having us.

00:43:52.370 --> 00:43:53.040 align:middle line:90%
>> RICE: Thank you so much.

00:43:53.040 --> 00:43:53.370 align:middle line:84%
>>COLE: And it's fun
to be able to talk

00:43:53.370 --> 00:43:55.390 align:middle line:90%
about this incredible story.

00:43:55.390 --> 00:43:56.190 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:43:56.190 --> 00:43:56.860 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:43:56.860 --> 00:43:57.660 align:middle line:90%
Thank you.

00:43:57.660 --> 00:44:00.660 align:middle line:10%
The name of the book is The
Flight of the Bon Monks.

00:44:00.660 --> 00:44:04.890 align:middle line:84%
Until next time, thank you for
joining us here on Open Minds.

00:44:04.890 --> 00:44:07.040 align:middle line:10%
