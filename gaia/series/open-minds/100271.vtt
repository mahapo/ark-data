00:00:27.852 --> 00:00:29.560 align:middle line:10%
>>REGINA MEREDITH: A
little while back, I

00:00:29.560 --> 00:00:31.660 align:middle line:10%
began a conversation
with Andrea Perron

00:00:31.660 --> 00:00:33.970 align:middle line:10%
about the nature of
spirits who interfere

00:00:33.970 --> 00:00:35.720 align:middle line:10%
with life in this dimension.

00:00:35.720 --> 00:00:38.990 align:middle line:84%
Her story has been made famous,
if not entirely accurate,

00:00:38.990 --> 00:00:40.610 align:middle line:90%
in the film "The Conjuring."

00:00:40.610 --> 00:00:43.340 align:middle line:84%
Her family endured some of
the most shocking phenomena

00:00:43.340 --> 00:00:44.250 align:middle line:90%
on record.

00:00:44.250 --> 00:00:46.720 align:middle line:84%
Today Andrea's going to
continue the story with us.

00:00:46.720 --> 00:00:50.160 align:middle line:84%
And last time, everyone in
the crew was mesmerized.

00:00:50.160 --> 00:00:52.400 align:middle line:84%
I was just I was hardly
doing an interview with you.

00:00:52.400 --> 00:00:55.080 align:middle line:84%
I was just kind of
gob-smacked, as they

00:00:55.080 --> 00:00:58.210 align:middle line:84%
say in Britain, with
the shocking nature,

00:00:58.210 --> 00:01:00.730 align:middle line:84%
and also the profound
nature of the stories.

00:01:00.730 --> 00:01:03.330 align:middle line:84%
And before we even get
into the interview,

00:01:03.330 --> 00:01:06.810 align:middle line:84%
we were talking off
camera a moment ago.

00:01:06.810 --> 00:01:09.310 align:middle line:84%
I know you're getting ready to
do a number of presentations,

00:01:09.310 --> 00:01:12.500 align:middle line:84%
but now the phenomena in
your own personal life

00:01:12.500 --> 00:01:15.480 align:middle line:84%
has really been ratcheting
up the last couple of weeks.

00:01:15.480 --> 00:01:17.335 align:middle line:84%
You shared a couple
things off camera.

00:01:17.335 --> 00:01:18.960 align:middle line:84%
So you can share a
little, if you like.

00:01:18.960 --> 00:01:20.334 align:middle line:84%
But what do you
think's going on,

00:01:20.334 --> 00:01:23.670 align:middle line:84%
as you start becoming more
public with all of this?

00:01:23.670 --> 00:01:27.940 align:middle line:10%
>>ANDREA PERRON: Well, I'm not
exactly sure what to think.

00:01:27.940 --> 00:01:31.220 align:middle line:10%
I have gone around the
whole country talking about,

00:01:31.220 --> 00:01:35.800 align:middle line:10%
of course, ghosts and spirits,
and our story, and the trilogy.

00:01:35.800 --> 00:01:39.750 align:middle line:84%
But I've also had other
experiences in my life,

00:01:39.750 --> 00:01:41.367 align:middle line:90%
and they began at the farm.

00:01:41.367 --> 00:01:43.700 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Yes, and we're going
to get into some of that,

00:01:43.700 --> 00:01:45.980 align:middle line:90%
and how these two dovetail.

00:01:45.980 --> 00:01:46.790 align:middle line:90%
Absolutely.

00:01:46.790 --> 00:01:52.100 align:middle line:84%
>>PERRON: But on my way here, I
had a series of strange events.

00:01:52.100 --> 00:01:54.840 align:middle line:84%
And it actually started
a couple of weeks ago.

00:01:54.840 --> 00:01:58.320 align:middle line:84%
I got up one morning--
actually, I was up already.

00:01:58.320 --> 00:02:02.450 align:middle line:84%
I generally wake up between
3:00 and 3:30 every morning.

00:02:02.450 --> 00:02:05.460 align:middle line:84%
Even if I went to bed at
2:00 AM, I'm back up at 3:00.

00:02:05.460 --> 00:02:06.540 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:02:06.540 --> 00:02:08.410 align:middle line:84%
The witching hour, when
the veils are thin.

00:02:08.410 --> 00:02:09.199 align:middle line:90%
>>PERRON: I guess.

00:02:09.199 --> 00:02:10.940 align:middle line:84%
Well, I don't believe
there is a veil.

00:02:10.940 --> 00:02:13.460 align:middle line:84%
So you know, I
just discount that.

00:02:13.460 --> 00:02:17.167 align:middle line:84%
But I do think that that's
when things are most active.

00:02:17.167 --> 00:02:17.750 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:02:17.750 --> 00:02:20.247 align:middle line:84%
>>PERRON: And so I'm
generally up working.

00:02:20.247 --> 00:02:21.330 align:middle line:90%
And it's good for me, too.

00:02:21.330 --> 00:02:25.010 align:middle line:84%
Because I continue to write
above and beyond these,

00:02:25.010 --> 00:02:28.070 align:middle line:84%
and that's a good, quiet
time in the house for me.

00:02:28.070 --> 00:02:31.700 align:middle line:84%
But my sister Christine has
to get up for work at 5:30

00:02:31.700 --> 00:02:32.400 align:middle line:90%
in the morning.

00:02:32.400 --> 00:02:33.190 align:middle line:90%
So I got up.

00:02:33.190 --> 00:02:36.470 align:middle line:84%
I set the coffee,
but didn't make it.

00:02:36.470 --> 00:02:37.980 align:middle line:90%
And I was waiting for her.

00:02:37.980 --> 00:02:39.800 align:middle line:84%
And her dog Libby
sleeps with her.

00:02:39.800 --> 00:02:43.900 align:middle line:84%
So when Chris got up at 5:30,
I went into the kitchen,

00:02:43.900 --> 00:02:48.422 align:middle line:84%
and I said, just hit the
button and I'll take Libby out.

00:02:48.422 --> 00:02:49.630 align:middle line:90%
And so I grabbed a cigarette.

00:02:49.630 --> 00:02:51.170 align:middle line:90%
Don't tell anybody I smoke.

00:02:51.170 --> 00:02:52.750 align:middle line:90%
It's my only vice.

00:02:52.750 --> 00:02:55.291 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Well, you just said
it to several thousand people--

00:02:55.291 --> 00:02:55.840 align:middle line:90%
but OK.

00:02:55.840 --> 00:02:57.560 align:middle line:84%
>>PERRON: If you think of
it as nutritious, though,

00:02:57.560 --> 00:02:58.268 align:middle line:90%
it's not harmful.

00:02:58.268 --> 00:03:00.650 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: There you go.

00:03:00.650 --> 00:03:03.550 align:middle line:84%
>>PERRON: And so I had my
big, blue, ugly robe on.

00:03:03.550 --> 00:03:06.810 align:middle line:84%
And it was very chilly out
that morning in Atlanta.

00:03:06.810 --> 00:03:10.130 align:middle line:84%
We live just west of Atlanta,
out in the countryside.

00:03:10.130 --> 00:03:13.120 align:middle line:90%
And I said, I'll take Libby out.

00:03:13.120 --> 00:03:15.930 align:middle line:84%
And she went down off the
deck, and I lit my cigarette,

00:03:15.930 --> 00:03:17.080 align:middle line:90%
and I was standing there.

00:03:17.080 --> 00:03:18.790 align:middle line:84%
And the sun wasn't
even up yet, but there

00:03:18.790 --> 00:03:22.810 align:middle line:84%
was that light-- that almost,
like, alpha level light--

00:03:22.810 --> 00:03:25.917 align:middle line:84%
and I could hear her crunching
around in the leaves.

00:03:25.917 --> 00:03:27.500 align:middle line:84%
I knew she was out
doing her business.

00:03:27.500 --> 00:03:28.710 align:middle line:90%
Good girl, Libby.

00:03:28.710 --> 00:03:30.660 align:middle line:84%
And I lit the
cigarette, and then I

00:03:30.660 --> 00:03:34.380 align:middle line:84%
put my lighter down on the glass
top table we have on the deck.

00:03:34.380 --> 00:03:38.800 align:middle line:84%
And a moment later,
my cigarette was gone.

00:03:38.800 --> 00:03:41.360 align:middle line:84%
And I couldn't--
what, did I drop it?

00:03:41.360 --> 00:03:43.900 align:middle line:84%
And so I started looking
around beneath me

00:03:43.900 --> 00:03:45.250 align:middle line:90%
on the ground at the deck.

00:03:45.250 --> 00:03:48.400 align:middle line:84%
And I looked, and looked,
and it wasn't there.

00:03:48.400 --> 00:03:50.770 align:middle line:84%
And I thought,
well, that's so odd.

00:03:50.770 --> 00:03:53.660 align:middle line:84%
And then I said, well,
OK, and it's freezing out.

00:03:53.660 --> 00:03:54.300 align:middle line:90%
Libby, come.

00:03:54.300 --> 00:03:55.150 align:middle line:90%
Libby, come.

00:03:55.150 --> 00:03:56.210 align:middle line:90%
Come now, Libby.

00:03:56.210 --> 00:03:58.920 align:middle line:84%
And this is what always
gets her up the stairs.

00:03:58.920 --> 00:04:02.270 align:middle line:84%
Libby, do not make me come
down there and get you.

00:04:02.270 --> 00:04:03.750 align:middle line:90%
That gets her up the stairs.

00:04:03.750 --> 00:04:04.410 align:middle line:90%
Nothing.

00:04:04.410 --> 00:04:06.030 align:middle line:90%
I heard nothing.

00:04:06.030 --> 00:04:08.490 align:middle line:84%
So at that point,
I was just a little

00:04:08.490 --> 00:04:10.050 align:middle line:90%
on the edge of perturbed.

00:04:10.050 --> 00:04:11.630 align:middle line:90%
And I walked back in the house.

00:04:11.630 --> 00:04:14.107 align:middle line:90%
I went into the kitchen.

00:04:14.107 --> 00:04:16.440 align:middle line:84%
I said, Christine, you're
going to have to go get Libby.

00:04:16.440 --> 00:04:18.980 align:middle line:84%
She won't listen to
me, and it's cold out,

00:04:18.980 --> 00:04:20.610 align:middle line:90%
and she needs to come in.

00:04:20.610 --> 00:04:24.270 align:middle line:84%
And she said, Ann,
she's right here.

00:04:24.270 --> 00:04:26.590 align:middle line:84%
And she stepped
aside, and Libby was

00:04:26.590 --> 00:04:29.870 align:middle line:84%
sitting there, looking up at
me, like, what's your problem?

00:04:29.870 --> 00:04:34.352 align:middle line:84%
And I said, Chris, I didn't
let Libby in the house.

00:04:34.352 --> 00:04:36.310 align:middle line:84%
And she said, honey, you
let Libby in the house

00:04:36.310 --> 00:04:38.100 align:middle line:90%
about 15 or 20 minutes ago.

00:04:38.100 --> 00:04:41.110 align:middle line:84%
I was getting ready to
come get you, because it's

00:04:41.110 --> 00:04:44.200 align:middle line:90%
too cold for you to be outside.

00:04:44.200 --> 00:04:47.000 align:middle line:84%
And she said, why does your
hair look so much grayer

00:04:47.000 --> 00:04:48.234 align:middle line:90%
than it did?

00:04:48.234 --> 00:04:49.400 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: A few minutes ago.

00:04:49.400 --> 00:04:51.350 align:middle line:90%
>>PERRON: A few minutes ago.

00:04:51.350 --> 00:04:55.450 align:middle line:84%
And I started to get choked
up, because I realized

00:04:55.450 --> 00:04:58.130 align:middle line:84%
something very
profound had happened,

00:04:58.130 --> 00:04:59.750 align:middle line:90%
and I didn't know what it was.

00:04:59.750 --> 00:05:01.780 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And you
have no recall yet?

00:05:01.780 --> 00:05:02.510 align:middle line:90%
>>PERRON: No.

00:05:02.510 --> 00:05:02.720 align:middle line:90%
No.

00:05:02.720 --> 00:05:04.969 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: It was just-- 15
or 20 minutes went missing?

00:05:04.969 --> 00:05:06.100 align:middle line:90%
>>PERRON: Went missing.

00:05:06.100 --> 00:05:10.240 align:middle line:84%
And that's never happened to me,
in my recollection, in my life.

00:05:10.240 --> 00:05:14.490 align:middle line:84%
I've been very significantly
connected on many levels

00:05:14.490 --> 00:05:18.860 align:middle line:84%
with spirit and with
extraterrestrial contact.

00:05:18.860 --> 00:05:22.280 align:middle line:84%
But I never felt-- people have
asked me over and over again,

00:05:22.280 --> 00:05:23.540 align:middle line:90%
have you ever been abducted?

00:05:23.540 --> 00:05:24.420 align:middle line:90%
No.

00:05:24.420 --> 00:05:28.330 align:middle line:84%
No, not to my-- it seems
to me-- missing time?

00:05:28.330 --> 00:05:29.380 align:middle line:90%
No.

00:05:29.380 --> 00:05:32.930 align:middle line:84%
And now I can't answer that
question the same way anymore.

00:05:32.930 --> 00:05:36.080 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And you're having
experiences and contact

00:05:36.080 --> 00:05:37.106 align:middle line:90%
with UFOs.

00:05:37.106 --> 00:05:38.980 align:middle line:84%
We're going to get into
that in a little bit.

00:05:38.980 --> 00:05:41.000 align:middle line:84%
And in addition, you had
some personal contact.

00:05:41.000 --> 00:05:43.740 align:middle line:84%
Because of course, when you
start speaking out publicly

00:05:43.740 --> 00:05:46.250 align:middle line:84%
and your story is
made known, it always

00:05:46.250 --> 00:05:48.540 align:middle line:84%
attracts interest
from various agencies.

00:05:48.540 --> 00:05:52.070 align:middle line:84%
And so you were telling that you
had a bizarre experience flying

00:05:52.070 --> 00:05:52.570 align:middle line:90%
out.

00:05:52.570 --> 00:05:53.170 align:middle line:90%
>>PERRON: Well, I did.

00:05:53.170 --> 00:05:54.330 align:middle line:90%
I had a couple, actually.

00:05:54.330 --> 00:05:56.380 align:middle line:84%
Because my sister took
me to the airport,

00:05:56.380 --> 00:06:00.610 align:middle line:84%
I needed to fly to San Antonio
and spend a week out there

00:06:00.610 --> 00:06:03.060 align:middle line:84%
at the Black Swan
Inn for the Halloween

00:06:03.060 --> 00:06:06.470 align:middle line:84%
and the Day of the
Dead festivities.

00:06:06.470 --> 00:06:09.300 align:middle line:84%
And when I got to the
airport, a gentleman

00:06:09.300 --> 00:06:11.740 align:middle line:84%
came over and helped
with my luggage.

00:06:11.740 --> 00:06:15.980 align:middle line:84%
And I pulled out my information,
and I handed him my license.

00:06:15.980 --> 00:06:17.990 align:middle line:84%
And he never even
looked at my license,

00:06:17.990 --> 00:06:19.870 align:middle line:90%
and he handed me my ticket.

00:06:19.870 --> 00:06:22.050 align:middle line:84%
And I thought that
was very strange.

00:06:22.050 --> 00:06:25.450 align:middle line:84%
And then he checked my
luggage for me, and I went in.

00:06:25.450 --> 00:06:29.310 align:middle line:84%
And nobody seemed to
be checking my ID.

00:06:29.310 --> 00:06:31.827 align:middle line:84%
I mean, maybe they-- I don't
know how to explain that.

00:06:31.827 --> 00:06:32.910 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: They usually do.

00:06:32.910 --> 00:06:34.035 align:middle line:90%
I mean, I fly all the time.

00:06:34.035 --> 00:06:35.240 align:middle line:90%
They always check ID.

00:06:35.240 --> 00:06:37.240 align:middle line:84%
>>PERRON: And then
I was escorted

00:06:37.240 --> 00:06:40.400 align:middle line:90%
through a little corridor.

00:06:40.400 --> 00:06:42.350 align:middle line:84%
I didn't go through
the scan machine.

00:06:42.350 --> 00:06:43.890 align:middle line:90%
I didn't-- my stuff did.

00:06:43.890 --> 00:06:45.900 align:middle line:84%
My handbag and my
other stuff did.

00:06:45.900 --> 00:06:47.504 align:middle line:90%
And then they took me around it.

00:06:47.504 --> 00:06:48.170 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Weird.

00:06:48.170 --> 00:06:50.378 align:middle line:84%
>>PERRON: And I picked up
my stuff on the other side.

00:06:50.378 --> 00:06:54.430 align:middle line:84%
I'm, like, why am I not getting
TSAed like everyone else?

00:06:54.430 --> 00:06:56.030 align:middle line:90%
I didn't understand.

00:06:56.030 --> 00:06:59.020 align:middle line:84%
And I went-- got on the
plane, got to San Antonio.

00:06:59.020 --> 00:07:00.260 align:middle line:90%
Everything was fine.

00:07:00.260 --> 00:07:02.040 align:middle line:84%
And then when JoAnn
Rivera took me

00:07:02.040 --> 00:07:07.330 align:middle line:84%
to the airport in San Antonio
to fly here to be with you,

00:07:07.330 --> 00:07:08.859 align:middle line:90%
the same thing happened.

00:07:08.859 --> 00:07:09.900 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: That's bizarre.

00:07:09.900 --> 00:07:11.316 align:middle line:84%
>>PERRON: The same
thing happened.

00:07:11.316 --> 00:07:12.930 align:middle line:90%
I wasn't scanned.

00:07:12.930 --> 00:07:16.550 align:middle line:84%
I was just brought through,
like, an adjunct corridor

00:07:16.550 --> 00:07:19.880 align:middle line:84%
and picked up the
rest of my stuff.

00:07:19.880 --> 00:07:22.290 align:middle line:90%
And I went and sat at the gate.

00:07:22.290 --> 00:07:23.752 align:middle line:90%
I was on an express--

00:07:23.752 --> 00:07:25.460 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Did you
have, like, a TSA pre-?

00:07:25.460 --> 00:07:26.760 align:middle line:90%
>>PERRON: No.

00:07:26.760 --> 00:07:27.260 align:middle line:90%
No.

00:07:27.260 --> 00:07:28.230 align:middle line:90%
Not that I know of.

00:07:28.230 --> 00:07:31.409 align:middle line:84%
I mean, unless something has
changed, and no one told me.

00:07:31.409 --> 00:07:31.950 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: OK.

00:07:31.950 --> 00:07:33.170 align:middle line:90%
So when you got on the plane--

00:07:33.170 --> 00:07:34.961 align:middle line:84%
>>PERRON: So I get on
the plane and there's

00:07:34.961 --> 00:07:36.080 align:middle line:90%
about 30 seats available.

00:07:36.080 --> 00:07:38.870 align:middle line:84%
It was not a full
flight, which is unusual.

00:07:38.870 --> 00:07:42.265 align:middle line:84%
And just as they were
ready to close the door,

00:07:42.265 --> 00:07:44.990 align:middle line:84%
a very tall, statuesque,
handsome woman

00:07:44.990 --> 00:07:46.072 align:middle line:90%
got on the plane.

00:07:46.072 --> 00:07:47.530 align:middle line:84%
And I looked at
her, and I thought,

00:07:47.530 --> 00:07:49.260 align:middle line:90%
she looks a little like KD Lang.

00:07:49.260 --> 00:07:51.800 align:middle line:84%
You know, she's a
beautiful woman.

00:07:51.800 --> 00:07:53.810 align:middle line:84%
And there were seats
available everywhere,

00:07:53.810 --> 00:07:56.340 align:middle line:84%
and she sat down
right next to me.

00:07:56.340 --> 00:08:00.660 align:middle line:84%
And it was an express flight, so
it's two seats, a corridor, two

00:08:00.660 --> 00:08:01.680 align:middle line:90%
seats.

00:08:01.680 --> 00:08:03.890 align:middle line:84%
And there were seats
everywhere available.

00:08:03.890 --> 00:08:06.850 align:middle line:84%
And so I said, OK, well,
maybe she wants to chat.

00:08:06.850 --> 00:08:09.470 align:middle line:90%
So I said hello.

00:08:09.470 --> 00:08:10.530 align:middle line:90%
I was very polite.

00:08:10.530 --> 00:08:13.330 align:middle line:84%
And I had one of
my books in my lap.

00:08:13.330 --> 00:08:15.090 align:middle line:90%
And she saw the dog.

00:08:15.090 --> 00:08:17.400 align:middle line:84%
I always-- all the
pictures of my dog

00:08:17.400 --> 00:08:18.442 align:middle line:90%
Gracie Pearl on the back.

00:08:18.442 --> 00:08:19.025 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:08:19.025 --> 00:08:21.290 align:middle line:84%
>>PERRON: And I said, this
is my dog Gracie Pearl.

00:08:21.290 --> 00:08:23.370 align:middle line:84%
And she said, oh,
I have dogs, too.

00:08:23.370 --> 00:08:24.760 align:middle line:90%
And she told me about her dogs.

00:08:24.760 --> 00:08:27.810 align:middle line:84%
And I said, I'm an
author and a lecturer.

00:08:27.810 --> 00:08:30.230 align:middle line:84%
And she said, I
know who you are.

00:08:30.230 --> 00:08:34.030 align:middle line:84%
I said, well, OK, a lot of
people do recognize me now.

00:08:34.030 --> 00:08:38.559 align:middle line:84%
And I introduced myself
officially-- my full name.

00:08:38.559 --> 00:08:40.669 align:middle line:90%
But she didn't tell me her name.

00:08:40.669 --> 00:08:43.409 align:middle line:84%
And I said, well,
what do you do?

00:08:43.409 --> 00:08:45.770 align:middle line:84%
And she turned, looked
me dead in the eye,

00:08:45.770 --> 00:08:49.530 align:middle line:84%
and she said, I work for
the federal government.

00:08:49.530 --> 00:08:51.584 align:middle line:90%
Well, OK.

00:08:51.584 --> 00:08:53.000 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So you
got your warning.

00:08:53.000 --> 00:08:55.431 align:middle line:84%
OK, so you know that's
an occupational hazard.

00:08:55.431 --> 00:08:56.930 align:middle line:84%
You get into the
weird stuff, you're

00:08:56.930 --> 00:08:59.410 align:middle line:84%
going to have a little bit
of a following, so to speak.

00:08:59.410 --> 00:08:59.730 align:middle line:90%
>>PERRON: So to speak.

00:08:59.730 --> 00:09:01.313 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So you
have a following of--

00:09:01.313 --> 00:09:03.130 align:middle line:84%
You have a following
on a number of levels.

00:09:03.130 --> 00:09:04.890 align:middle line:84%
And so I guess the
high strangeness--

00:09:04.890 --> 00:09:07.160 align:middle line:84%
it continues and will
probably intensify.

00:09:07.160 --> 00:09:09.410 align:middle line:84%
And we're going to get into
it, especially where we're

00:09:09.410 --> 00:09:10.950 align:middle line:84%
looking at some
of the UFO contact

00:09:10.950 --> 00:09:12.804 align:middle line:84%
and such later in this
particular program.

00:09:12.804 --> 00:09:14.720 align:middle line:84%
>>PERRON: And it's
important, because I really

00:09:14.720 --> 00:09:16.960 align:middle line:84%
do believe there is some
integration-- a point

00:09:16.960 --> 00:09:19.010 align:middle line:90%
of integration or correlation.

00:09:19.010 --> 00:09:20.347 align:middle line:90%
I don't know what it is yet.

00:09:20.347 --> 00:09:20.930 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:09:20.930 --> 00:09:23.050 align:middle line:90%
>>PERRON: But it exists.

00:09:23.050 --> 00:09:24.780 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: It sounds
as though it does.

00:09:24.780 --> 00:09:26.581 align:middle line:84%
So one of the things
we never talked about

00:09:26.581 --> 00:09:28.830 align:middle line:84%
in the last interview,
although I had a note to do it,

00:09:28.830 --> 00:09:31.670 align:middle line:84%
was what happened to
you at Walden Pond?

00:09:31.670 --> 00:09:35.180 align:middle line:84%
Which really spawned all of
this, when you were told you,

00:09:35.180 --> 00:09:37.160 align:middle line:84%
too, are going to
become a writer.

00:09:37.160 --> 00:09:38.850 align:middle line:84%
>>PERRON: Oh, it
was at the farm.

00:09:38.850 --> 00:09:40.630 align:middle line:90%
It was at the pond on the farm.

00:09:40.630 --> 00:09:41.588 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: On your farm.

00:09:41.588 --> 00:09:41.630 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:09:41.630 --> 00:09:42.690 align:middle line:90%
>>PERRON: Our farm, yes.

00:09:42.690 --> 00:09:44.650 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And so I just
morphed those two into one.

00:09:44.650 --> 00:09:45.150 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:09:45.150 --> 00:09:47.090 align:middle line:90%
So what happened?

00:09:47.090 --> 00:09:50.670 align:middle line:84%
>>PERRON: Well, you know from
reading the books that we

00:09:50.670 --> 00:09:52.550 align:middle line:90%
went out on the property a lot.

00:09:52.550 --> 00:09:54.040 align:middle line:90%
We had 200 acres.

00:09:54.040 --> 00:09:56.190 align:middle line:84%
Talk about the
ultimate playground.

00:09:56.190 --> 00:10:00.330 align:middle line:84%
And we were down at the river,
and then my sister Nancy

00:10:00.330 --> 00:10:02.650 align:middle line:84%
said, let's go
fishing at the pond.

00:10:02.650 --> 00:10:05.270 align:middle line:84%
Well, she wanted to cut
some cat o'nine tails

00:10:05.270 --> 00:10:07.020 align:middle line:90%
around the other side.

00:10:07.020 --> 00:10:09.690 align:middle line:84%
And she-- I think
Cindy was with us, too.

00:10:09.690 --> 00:10:12.070 align:middle line:84%
And I was just sitting
at the waterfall.

00:10:12.070 --> 00:10:14.800 align:middle line:84%
And I closed my
eyes, and I was just

00:10:14.800 --> 00:10:16.379 align:middle line:90%
listening to the waterfall.

00:10:16.379 --> 00:10:18.920 align:middle line:84%
And I don't know if I even wrote
the whole thing in the book,

00:10:18.920 --> 00:10:20.500 align:middle line:84%
but this is actually
what happened.

00:10:20.500 --> 00:10:21.930 align:middle line:90%
I was 12 years old.

00:10:21.930 --> 00:10:25.750 align:middle line:90%
It was our first spring there.

00:10:25.750 --> 00:10:33.090 align:middle line:84%
And I saw myself holding a
book in this vision that I had,

00:10:33.090 --> 00:10:36.710 align:middle line:84%
holding a book that
had my name on it.

00:10:36.710 --> 00:10:38.900 align:middle line:84%
And I thought, well,
that's very odd.

00:10:38.900 --> 00:10:43.960 align:middle line:84%
And I had asked my mother,
right after we moved in,

00:10:43.960 --> 00:10:48.410 align:middle line:84%
if she would be so kind
as to get me a journal.

00:10:48.410 --> 00:10:51.880 align:middle line:84%
I knew I needed to
start taking notes.

00:10:51.880 --> 00:10:54.180 align:middle line:84%
I needed to start
writing down what

00:10:54.180 --> 00:10:56.202 align:middle line:90%
I was seeing in that house.

00:10:56.202 --> 00:10:58.160 align:middle line:84%
And even though we weren't
really discussing it

00:10:58.160 --> 00:11:00.220 align:middle line:84%
with her at that
point, my sisters

00:11:00.220 --> 00:11:03.470 align:middle line:84%
were coming to me with
their disclosures.

00:11:03.470 --> 00:11:06.180 align:middle line:84%
Mom wasn't sharing anything
that was happening with her.

00:11:06.180 --> 00:11:08.990 align:middle line:84%
She didn't want to
frighten us, of course.

00:11:08.990 --> 00:11:11.270 align:middle line:84%
And it wasn't until
about five or six months

00:11:11.270 --> 00:11:13.787 align:middle line:84%
after we moved there
that everybody--

00:11:13.787 --> 00:11:14.870 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Started sharing.

00:11:14.870 --> 00:11:16.170 align:middle line:90%
>>PERRON: Yeah.

00:11:16.170 --> 00:11:18.830 align:middle line:84%
It was more a spilling of the
guts, is really what it was.

00:11:18.830 --> 00:11:18.990 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:11:18.990 --> 00:11:19.573 align:middle line:90%
Yeah, exactly.

00:11:19.573 --> 00:11:20.580 align:middle line:90%
It was unavoidable.

00:11:20.580 --> 00:11:24.350 align:middle line:84%
So let's talk about the nature
of these disincarnate beings

00:11:24.350 --> 00:11:26.110 align:middle line:90%
that are in the other realm.

00:11:26.110 --> 00:11:29.590 align:middle line:84%
There's so many different
philosophies and speculations

00:11:29.590 --> 00:11:34.710 align:middle line:84%
as to what they are, and
for what aspect of a being

00:11:34.710 --> 00:11:38.340 align:middle line:84%
is showing itself to you
from those other realms.

00:11:38.340 --> 00:11:41.710 align:middle line:84%
>>PERRON: What I have
learned from my experience--

00:11:41.710 --> 00:11:46.590 align:middle line:84%
and let me preface this remark
with there is a huge quantum

00:11:46.590 --> 00:11:51.070 align:middle line:84%
leap between believing
something which is faith-based

00:11:51.070 --> 00:11:53.170 align:middle line:90%
and knowing something.

00:11:53.170 --> 00:11:58.830 align:middle line:84%
And I just turned 56, in our
absence between interviews.

00:11:58.830 --> 00:12:03.160 align:middle line:84%
And I saw my first full body
apparition at the age 12,

00:12:03.160 --> 00:12:06.070 align:middle line:84%
so solid in appearance
that I greeted

00:12:06.070 --> 00:12:07.800 align:middle line:90%
him and he did not respond.

00:12:07.800 --> 00:12:08.610 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: You
thought he was human.

00:12:08.610 --> 00:12:09.734 align:middle line:90%
>>PERRON: I thought he was.

00:12:09.734 --> 00:12:13.670 align:middle line:84%
And dressed rather
oddly, but human.

00:12:13.670 --> 00:12:19.240 align:middle line:84%
And at 56, I still
don't know exactly what

00:12:19.240 --> 00:12:23.720 align:middle line:84%
it is that we lived with, shared
space with, and interacted

00:12:23.720 --> 00:12:25.700 align:middle line:90%
with on a regular basis.

00:12:25.700 --> 00:12:27.490 align:middle line:90%
But I know what it's not.

00:12:27.490 --> 00:12:30.020 align:middle line:84%
It was not a figment
of imagination,

00:12:30.020 --> 00:12:33.535 align:middle line:84%
it was not an optical illusion,
and it was not mass hysteria.

00:12:33.535 --> 00:12:36.190 align:middle line:84%
You know as well as
I do that millions

00:12:36.190 --> 00:12:39.580 align:middle line:84%
of people around this planet
have been profoundly touched

00:12:39.580 --> 00:12:40.740 align:middle line:90%
by spirit.

00:12:40.740 --> 00:12:45.120 align:middle line:84%
And once that door is opened,
it can never be closed again.

00:12:45.120 --> 00:12:47.554 align:middle line:84%
You can't unexpand
a consciousness.

00:12:47.554 --> 00:12:48.220 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:12:48.220 --> 00:12:50.620 align:middle line:84%
>>PERRON: So I
don't know exactly,

00:12:50.620 --> 00:12:54.260 align:middle line:84%
but I do know that
they retain elements

00:12:54.260 --> 00:12:57.330 align:middle line:90%
of their characteristics.

00:12:57.330 --> 00:12:58.295 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: From the--

00:12:58.295 --> 00:12:59.200 align:middle line:90%
>>PERRON: From their life.

00:12:59.200 --> 00:13:00.866 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Well, I
mean-- but you wonder,

00:13:00.866 --> 00:13:05.870 align:middle line:84%
because some of these beings
were from 100, 200 years ago

00:13:05.870 --> 00:13:06.550 align:middle line:90%
and whatnot.

00:13:06.550 --> 00:13:10.000 align:middle line:84%
And certainly,
the soul portion--

00:13:10.000 --> 00:13:12.760 align:middle line:84%
of course, everybody debates
what that part even is--

00:13:12.760 --> 00:13:14.550 align:middle line:84%
must have gone on
and incarnated.

00:13:14.550 --> 00:13:17.770 align:middle line:84%
And in fact, it was--
we talked about it

00:13:17.770 --> 00:13:20.280 align:middle line:84%
the very end of the last
interview-- you came

00:13:20.280 --> 00:13:24.450 align:middle line:84%
to believe, understand, know--
I don't know which one it is,

00:13:24.450 --> 00:13:27.920 align:middle line:84%
you can clarify it-- that one
of those beings that was showing

00:13:27.920 --> 00:13:30.707 align:middle line:90%
itself to you was you.

00:13:30.707 --> 00:13:31.290 align:middle line:90%
>>PERRON: Yes.

00:13:31.290 --> 00:13:32.460 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: An aspect of you.

00:13:32.460 --> 00:13:33.750 align:middle line:90%
Yet here you are.

00:13:33.750 --> 00:13:35.569 align:middle line:84%
This is where it
gets interesting.

00:13:35.569 --> 00:13:36.610 align:middle line:90%
>>PERRON: And convoluted.

00:13:36.610 --> 00:13:37.651 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: And convoluted.

00:13:37.651 --> 00:13:39.370 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So what
is left behind?

00:13:39.370 --> 00:13:41.520 align:middle line:90%
What continues its journey?

00:13:41.520 --> 00:13:43.760 align:middle line:84%
Those beings--
even Bathsheba may

00:13:43.760 --> 00:13:45.840 align:middle line:84%
have had two or
three incarnations,

00:13:45.840 --> 00:13:48.810 align:middle line:84%
the soul portion that had
occupied her since that time.

00:13:48.810 --> 00:13:50.020 align:middle line:90%
How do you view all of that?

00:13:50.020 --> 00:13:51.820 align:middle line:90%


00:13:51.820 --> 00:13:55.250 align:middle line:84%
>>PERRON: I don't think that you
have a soul, and I have a soul.

00:13:55.250 --> 00:14:01.730 align:middle line:84%
And I think there is a soul,
and that we all tap into that.

00:14:01.730 --> 00:14:05.180 align:middle line:90%
That we are each a part of it.

00:14:05.180 --> 00:14:08.170 align:middle line:84%
And I think that we
are recycled in terms

00:14:08.170 --> 00:14:12.360 align:middle line:84%
of coming back and forth--
through to a human existence.

00:14:12.360 --> 00:14:13.960 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:14:13.960 --> 00:14:16.680 align:middle line:84%
>>PERRON: And that
would explain--

00:14:16.680 --> 00:14:21.030 align:middle line:84%
it wasn't just that I saw
her; she reacted to me.

00:14:21.030 --> 00:14:26.230 align:middle line:84%
She smiled so sweetly and her
eyes were locked onto mine.

00:14:26.230 --> 00:14:30.310 align:middle line:84%
And she let me know that
I had been there before.

00:14:30.310 --> 00:14:33.370 align:middle line:84%
And I don't know if
she was residual energy

00:14:33.370 --> 00:14:37.950 align:middle line:84%
or if she was in some way,
shape, or form a guardian

00:14:37.950 --> 00:14:41.670 align:middle line:84%
to me, but I do know
that she resembled me

00:14:41.670 --> 00:14:43.560 align:middle line:90%
in virtually every way.

00:14:43.560 --> 00:14:46.150 align:middle line:84%
I mean, from the
cheekbones, to the eyes,

00:14:46.150 --> 00:14:49.070 align:middle line:90%
every facial-- all the hair.

00:14:49.070 --> 00:14:50.890 align:middle line:84%
I've got thick,
long-- at the time

00:14:50.890 --> 00:14:54.490 align:middle line:84%
I was 17 years old-- thick,
long, black, bushy hair.

00:14:54.490 --> 00:14:57.700 align:middle line:84%
And she had it all swept up in
a bun on the top of her head,

00:14:57.700 --> 00:14:58.519 align:middle line:90%
only it was gray.

00:14:58.519 --> 00:15:00.560 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: But it was more
what you feel and know.

00:15:00.560 --> 00:15:03.220 align:middle line:84%
>>PERRON: I loved
her, and she loved me,

00:15:03.220 --> 00:15:05.250 align:middle line:84%
and the connection
was beautiful.

00:15:05.250 --> 00:15:06.410 align:middle line:90%
It was sublime.

00:15:06.410 --> 00:15:10.270 align:middle line:84%
But I also knew enough
not to tell my family

00:15:10.270 --> 00:15:11.650 align:middle line:90%
that I recognized her.

00:15:11.650 --> 00:15:13.830 align:middle line:90%
They saw her from the side.

00:15:13.830 --> 00:15:15.150 align:middle line:90%
And she was my size.

00:15:15.150 --> 00:15:19.790 align:middle line:90%
She was a big, strong woman.

00:15:19.790 --> 00:15:21.380 align:middle line:90%
But they didn't see her face.

00:15:21.380 --> 00:15:23.180 align:middle line:90%
I'm the only one who did.

00:15:23.180 --> 00:15:26.620 align:middle line:84%
And I chose not to share
what I saw with my family,

00:15:26.620 --> 00:15:28.050 align:middle line:90%
because I didn't want--

00:15:28.050 --> 00:15:29.258 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: It's too confusing.

00:15:29.258 --> 00:15:31.690 align:middle line:84%
>>PERRON: --any of them to
be burdened by the notion.

00:15:31.690 --> 00:15:35.090 align:middle line:84%
But I knew then that
it was most likely

00:15:35.090 --> 00:15:39.120 align:middle line:84%
that my family moved to that
farmhouse because of me.

00:15:39.120 --> 00:15:40.052 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Mm hm.

00:15:40.052 --> 00:15:41.260 align:middle line:90%
>>PERRON: And I'll tell you--

00:15:41.260 --> 00:15:43.080 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And you were not
being as negatively impacted

00:15:43.080 --> 00:15:43.770 align:middle line:90%
as the others.

00:15:43.770 --> 00:15:44.570 align:middle line:90%
>>PERRON: I wasn't at all.

00:15:44.570 --> 00:15:46.450 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Did you have
any guilt around that?

00:15:46.450 --> 00:15:50.120 align:middle line:84%
That others were going through
these torturous events,

00:15:50.120 --> 00:15:51.180 align:middle line:90%
particularly your mother?

00:15:51.180 --> 00:15:52.197 align:middle line:90%
>>PERRON: And Cindy.

00:15:52.197 --> 00:15:53.030 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: And Cindy.

00:15:53.030 --> 00:15:55.730 align:middle line:84%
And yeah, we're going to
talk about that in a bit.

00:15:55.730 --> 00:15:56.430 align:middle line:90%
>>PERRON: Cindy went through it.

00:15:56.430 --> 00:15:57.929 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Yeah, she
went through it.

00:15:57.929 --> 00:16:00.120 align:middle line:84%
Did that make you feel
heavy-hearted on some level,

00:16:00.120 --> 00:16:02.780 align:middle line:84%
that it could've been because
of you-- that you were all

00:16:02.780 --> 00:16:04.280 align:middle line:84%
drawn there for
something about you,

00:16:04.280 --> 00:16:06.570 align:middle line:84%
before you've truly
understood this?

00:16:06.570 --> 00:16:09.040 align:middle line:90%
>>PERRON: No, not at the time.

00:16:09.040 --> 00:16:11.380 align:middle line:84%
Even at that age,
at that tender age,

00:16:11.380 --> 00:16:16.660 align:middle line:84%
I understood that whatever it
was that conspired to get us

00:16:16.660 --> 00:16:19.920 align:middle line:84%
there had likewise
conspired to keep us there,

00:16:19.920 --> 00:16:23.200 align:middle line:84%
and that there was
purpose and reason in it.

00:16:23.200 --> 00:16:26.540 align:middle line:84%
My emotion was much
more protective.

00:16:26.540 --> 00:16:28.930 align:middle line:84%
I felt guilty going
off to college.

00:16:28.930 --> 00:16:29.610 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:16:29.610 --> 00:16:33.000 align:middle line:84%
>>PERRON: Because I wasn't
there anymore to oversee.

00:16:33.000 --> 00:16:35.760 align:middle line:84%
And we had this thing we
called the "ghost post."

00:16:35.760 --> 00:16:39.020 align:middle line:84%
So whenever anything
occurred in the house,

00:16:39.020 --> 00:16:41.090 align:middle line:90%
my sisters would write to me.

00:16:41.090 --> 00:16:43.610 align:middle line:84%
And I have a whole series
of letters of this happened,

00:16:43.610 --> 00:16:45.830 align:middle line:84%
and that happened, and
the other thing happened.

00:16:45.830 --> 00:16:47.855 align:middle line:84%
And I felt bad that
I wasn't there.

00:16:47.855 --> 00:16:48.830 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Because you were
the eldest of the girls.

00:16:48.830 --> 00:16:49.140 align:middle line:90%
>>PERRON: Mm hm.

00:16:49.140 --> 00:16:49.960 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:16:49.960 --> 00:16:56.390 align:middle line:84%
>>PERRON: And I had gone off to
Pittsburgh in September of '76.

00:16:56.390 --> 00:16:59.100 align:middle line:84%
So I was only home
for the summers,

00:16:59.100 --> 00:17:01.869 align:middle line:84%
and during-- we had the month
of January off each year.

00:17:01.869 --> 00:17:04.160 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And so you felt
they were somewhat vulnerable

00:17:04.160 --> 00:17:04.630 align:middle line:90%
without you.

00:17:04.630 --> 00:17:05.255 align:middle line:90%
>>PERRON: Yeah.

00:17:05.255 --> 00:17:07.109 align:middle line:84%
So I was away from
the house 8 out

00:17:07.109 --> 00:17:10.780 align:middle line:84%
of 12 months for the last
four years that we were there.

00:17:10.780 --> 00:17:14.020 align:middle line:84%
And that was what
I felt badly about,

00:17:14.020 --> 00:17:17.849 align:middle line:84%
because I was now absent
and not someone that they

00:17:17.849 --> 00:17:19.230 align:middle line:90%
could come to anymore.

00:17:19.230 --> 00:17:19.910 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Mm hm.

00:17:19.910 --> 00:17:24.160 align:middle line:84%
You know, on this
topic of the entities

00:17:24.160 --> 00:17:25.599 align:middle line:84%
and the nature of
the entities, I

00:17:25.599 --> 00:17:30.620 align:middle line:84%
remember years ago listening
to a tape by Abraham.

00:17:30.620 --> 00:17:33.490 align:middle line:84%
Esther Hicks was bringing
the Abraham group through.

00:17:33.490 --> 00:17:35.320 align:middle line:84%
And they were talking
about the nature

00:17:35.320 --> 00:17:39.010 align:middle line:84%
of what happens when John
Edwards and people were

00:17:39.010 --> 00:17:41.490 align:middle line:84%
speaking to ghosts in
the other dimension.

00:17:41.490 --> 00:17:47.540 align:middle line:84%
And what was said was
that, by your remembrance

00:17:47.540 --> 00:17:51.710 align:middle line:84%
and keeping them alive in your
energy field and greater mind,

00:17:51.710 --> 00:17:55.010 align:middle line:84%
that it was almost creating,
like, a coalescing factor

00:17:55.010 --> 00:17:59.130 align:middle line:84%
to bring them back into some
kind of substantive reality

00:17:59.130 --> 00:18:00.840 align:middle line:90%
for communication.

00:18:00.840 --> 00:18:03.442 align:middle line:84%
And so-- but that would sound
very different than what

00:18:03.442 --> 00:18:04.400 align:middle line:90%
you were talking about.

00:18:04.400 --> 00:18:07.490 align:middle line:84%
You weren't conjuring
these beings.

00:18:07.490 --> 00:18:09.490 align:middle line:84%
They were there to greet
you when you got there.

00:18:09.490 --> 00:18:10.156 align:middle line:90%
>>PERRON: Mm hm.

00:18:10.156 --> 00:18:11.840 align:middle line:90%
And they don't come when called.

00:18:11.840 --> 00:18:14.910 align:middle line:90%
So it was their decision.

00:18:14.910 --> 00:18:18.870 align:middle line:84%
It was an act, apparently,
of free will on their part

00:18:18.870 --> 00:18:21.230 align:middle line:84%
when they chose to
communicate with us.

00:18:21.230 --> 00:18:24.140 align:middle line:84%
And many of them didn't
communicate at all.

00:18:24.140 --> 00:18:25.650 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: They just watched.

00:18:25.650 --> 00:18:28.210 align:middle line:84%
>>PERRON: Well, they were
oblivious to our existence

00:18:28.210 --> 00:18:28.710 align:middle line:90%
completely.

00:18:28.710 --> 00:18:28.800 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: That's true.

00:18:28.800 --> 00:18:30.091 align:middle line:90%
They're in their own dimension.

00:18:30.091 --> 00:18:31.030 align:middle line:90%
That would make sense.

00:18:31.030 --> 00:18:31.826 align:middle line:90%
>>PERRON: Yeah.

00:18:31.826 --> 00:18:33.200 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Just as
we normally are

00:18:33.200 --> 00:18:35.700 align:middle line:84%
oblivious to them-- most of
us are oblivious to them,

00:18:35.700 --> 00:18:38.410 align:middle line:84%
your family had sensitivities--
it would make sense

00:18:38.410 --> 00:18:40.090 align:middle line:90%
that they're oblivious to us.

00:18:40.090 --> 00:18:42.910 align:middle line:84%
There is a divide between
dimensions, so to speak,

00:18:42.910 --> 00:18:44.470 align:middle line:90%
of density.

00:18:44.470 --> 00:18:45.470 align:middle line:90%
>>PERRON: And vibration.

00:18:45.470 --> 00:18:46.928 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And
vibration, of course.

00:18:46.928 --> 00:18:48.060 align:middle line:90%
So they wouldn't know.

00:18:48.060 --> 00:18:50.137 align:middle line:84%
So that's what's interesting
is-- that's right,

00:18:50.137 --> 00:18:52.470 align:middle line:84%
that they just appeared to
kind of be living their life,

00:18:52.470 --> 00:18:54.160 align:middle line:90%
and you were peering in on them.

00:18:54.160 --> 00:18:55.140 align:middle line:84%
>>PERRON: Well,
you can't see them.

00:18:55.140 --> 00:18:56.740 align:middle line:84%
But they're all
around me right now.

00:18:56.740 --> 00:18:57.530 align:middle line:90%
I feel them.

00:18:57.530 --> 00:18:57.820 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah, yeah.

00:18:57.820 --> 00:18:58.490 align:middle line:90%
>>PERRON: I know you feel them.

00:18:58.490 --> 00:18:58.980 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Oh, I do.

00:18:58.980 --> 00:19:00.420 align:middle line:84%
We talked about it
before we started.

00:19:00.420 --> 00:19:01.100 align:middle line:84%
>>PERRON: We just
talked about that.

00:19:01.100 --> 00:19:01.410 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:19:01.410 --> 00:19:02.910 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And some good
energy here in this room.

00:19:02.910 --> 00:19:04.110 align:middle line:84%
A lot of nice little
beings in the room.

00:19:04.110 --> 00:19:04.360 align:middle line:90%
>>PERRON: Yeah.

00:19:04.360 --> 00:19:07.000 align:middle line:84%
And they're very pleased that
I'm here with you, as I am,

00:19:07.000 --> 00:19:08.130 align:middle line:90%
as well.

00:19:08.130 --> 00:19:11.890 align:middle line:84%
Because I'm telling their story,
and that's what they wanted.

00:19:11.890 --> 00:19:14.260 align:middle line:84%
And I will tell you,
Regina, I don't want

00:19:14.260 --> 00:19:16.460 align:middle line:90%
to come back to Earth again.

00:19:16.460 --> 00:19:18.370 align:middle line:90%
I want this to be it for me.

00:19:18.370 --> 00:19:21.430 align:middle line:84%
And part of the reason
that I wrote these books

00:19:21.430 --> 00:19:24.550 align:middle line:84%
was, perhaps, this
is my ticket out.

00:19:24.550 --> 00:19:26.610 align:middle line:84%
And it's not that
I don't love Earth,

00:19:26.610 --> 00:19:29.350 align:middle line:84%
and I don't love all the
mere mortals around me,

00:19:29.350 --> 00:19:32.240 align:middle line:84%
but I have said all my
life, I don't belong here.

00:19:32.240 --> 00:19:33.230 align:middle line:90%
I am a misfit.

00:19:33.230 --> 00:19:34.390 align:middle line:90%
I do not belong here.

00:19:34.390 --> 00:19:36.190 align:middle line:90%
Why am I here?

00:19:36.190 --> 00:19:38.560 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Well, now
you have your answer.

00:19:38.560 --> 00:19:40.464 align:middle line:84%
You got it back when
you were 12 years old--

00:19:40.464 --> 00:19:41.130 align:middle line:90%
>>PERRON: Mm hm.

00:19:41.130 --> 00:19:42.350 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: --when
you saw that book.

00:19:42.350 --> 00:19:44.725 align:middle line:84%
It took all those years to
come to terms with all of this

00:19:44.725 --> 00:19:47.766 align:middle line:84%
and then put it together and
put it out into the world.

00:19:47.766 --> 00:19:49.390 align:middle line:84%
Let's talk about some
of the phenomena.

00:19:49.390 --> 00:19:51.250 align:middle line:84%
We talked about a lot of
phenomena in the last one.

00:19:51.250 --> 00:19:53.110 align:middle line:84%
We're going to talk
about more right now.

00:19:53.110 --> 00:19:56.300 align:middle line:84%
Just a teensy bit in our
third conversation, and more

00:19:56.300 --> 00:19:58.725 align:middle line:84%
go into the larger themes
in the third conversation.

00:19:58.725 --> 00:19:59.350 align:middle line:90%
>>PERRON: Good.

00:19:59.350 --> 00:20:02.850 align:middle line:84%
Because that's really where
I generally reside now

00:20:02.850 --> 00:20:04.230 align:middle line:90%
are the big--

00:20:04.230 --> 00:20:08.420 align:middle line:84%
People think that we live on a
three-dimensional, five-sensory

00:20:08.420 --> 00:20:10.950 align:middle line:84%
planet, and nothing could
be further from the truth.

00:20:10.950 --> 00:20:12.450 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: It's so
multi-dimensional.

00:20:12.450 --> 00:20:14.350 align:middle line:84%
>>PERRON: We live in
a multi-dimensional,

00:20:14.350 --> 00:20:16.007 align:middle line:90%
ultra-sensory universe.

00:20:16.007 --> 00:20:16.590 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:20:16.590 --> 00:20:20.330 align:middle line:84%
>>PERRON: And that's the leap
that humanity needs to take.

00:20:20.330 --> 00:20:24.330 align:middle line:84%
And when I'm speaking with
mortal souls who cannot seem

00:20:24.330 --> 00:20:28.650 align:middle line:84%
to wrap their minds around
that, and they individualize it

00:20:28.650 --> 00:20:33.230 align:middle line:90%
and say, I miss my grandmother.

00:20:33.230 --> 00:20:35.390 align:middle line:84%
Can you put me in touch
with my grandmother?

00:20:35.390 --> 00:20:37.470 align:middle line:90%
I say, you don't need me.

00:20:37.470 --> 00:20:38.780 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Just talk to her.

00:20:38.780 --> 00:20:40.020 align:middle line:90%
>>PERRON: Talk to her.

00:20:40.020 --> 00:20:41.850 align:middle line:84%
And you will not--
believe me, she

00:20:41.850 --> 00:20:46.270 align:middle line:84%
will find a way to communicate
with you that is unmistakable.

00:20:46.270 --> 00:20:49.060 align:middle line:90%
You will know it's her.

00:20:49.060 --> 00:20:49.730 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: OK.

00:20:49.730 --> 00:20:52.960 align:middle line:90%
So emotion, love, fear, anger.

00:20:52.960 --> 00:20:53.720 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:20:53.720 --> 00:20:56.200 align:middle line:90%
And a lot of what binds is love.

00:20:56.200 --> 00:20:59.817 align:middle line:84%
But a lot of what activates
can also be fear and anger.

00:20:59.817 --> 00:21:01.650 align:middle line:84%
And I want to talk about
the nature of that.

00:21:01.650 --> 00:21:04.570 align:middle line:84%
Because in your
home, as the fighting

00:21:04.570 --> 00:21:06.100 align:middle line:84%
was going on,
because this created

00:21:06.100 --> 00:21:11.290 align:middle line:84%
such a cut of trust
and tenderness

00:21:11.290 --> 00:21:12.700 align:middle line:90%
between your parents.

00:21:12.700 --> 00:21:14.000 align:middle line:90%
Your dad couldn't handle it.

00:21:14.000 --> 00:21:14.740 align:middle line:90%
He denied it.

00:21:14.740 --> 00:21:17.340 align:middle line:84%
Your mother was
disintegrating by the day.

00:21:17.340 --> 00:21:19.950 align:middle line:10%
And so there was fighting
going on in the house,

00:21:19.950 --> 00:21:22.410 align:middle line:10%
and a lot of things
were activated.

00:21:22.410 --> 00:21:24.660 align:middle line:84%
I want to talk about
the nature of what

00:21:24.660 --> 00:21:27.820 align:middle line:84%
you feel is going on when
this anger is almost being

00:21:27.820 --> 00:21:29.160 align:middle line:90%
used as some kind of fuel.

00:21:29.160 --> 00:21:30.960 align:middle line:90%
What are the beings doing?

00:21:30.960 --> 00:21:32.780 align:middle line:84%
What are they trying
to demonstrate,

00:21:32.780 --> 00:21:35.140 align:middle line:90%
in acting up in those moments?

00:21:35.140 --> 00:21:36.720 align:middle line:90%
>>PERRON: I don't know, exactly.

00:21:36.720 --> 00:21:40.230 align:middle line:84%
I don't know if they were
trying to stop it from happening

00:21:40.230 --> 00:21:43.720 align:middle line:84%
or if they were trying
to be a distraction,

00:21:43.720 --> 00:21:46.850 align:middle line:84%
or if it was literally
a manifestation

00:21:46.850 --> 00:21:51.460 align:middle line:84%
of the negative energy that was
transpiring between my parents.

00:21:51.460 --> 00:21:54.700 align:middle line:84%
The breach was
permanent, as you know.

00:21:54.700 --> 00:21:56.860 align:middle line:84%
The chasm became
so wide that there

00:21:56.860 --> 00:21:59.570 align:middle line:90%
was no bridge long enough.

00:21:59.570 --> 00:22:04.670 align:middle line:84%
My father waited far too
long to actually admit--

00:22:04.670 --> 00:22:11.200 align:middle line:84%
he actually did come around
way sooner than he spoke of.

00:22:11.200 --> 00:22:12.910 align:middle line:90%
But he was so afraid.

00:22:12.910 --> 00:22:15.890 align:middle line:84%
He was the one that
was most fearful.

00:22:15.890 --> 00:22:18.870 align:middle line:84%
And couple that when
my father is fearful,

00:22:18.870 --> 00:22:21.480 align:middle line:90%
he lashes out in anger.

00:22:21.480 --> 00:22:24.760 align:middle line:84%
And so whenever
he was terrified,

00:22:24.760 --> 00:22:29.452 align:middle line:84%
it heightened that
expression in him.

00:22:29.452 --> 00:22:31.910 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And so what happened
with the beings in the house

00:22:31.910 --> 00:22:32.650 align:middle line:90%
when he did this?

00:22:32.650 --> 00:22:34.060 align:middle line:84%
>>PERRON: Well,
it fed the beast.

00:22:34.060 --> 00:22:34.685 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:22:34.685 --> 00:22:38.080 align:middle line:10%
>>PERRON: And when Mrs. Warren
came, she said to my parents,

00:22:38.080 --> 00:22:41.700 align:middle line:10%
if you two are going to argue,
get out of this house to do it.

00:22:41.700 --> 00:22:43.120 align:middle line:10%
Do not do this.

00:22:43.120 --> 00:22:45.920 align:middle line:84%
Because if you do,
the ramifications

00:22:45.920 --> 00:22:48.340 align:middle line:84%
will fall on the shoulders
of your children.

00:22:48.340 --> 00:22:51.020 align:middle line:90%
And she was right about that.

00:22:51.020 --> 00:22:53.360 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: How did this manifest?

00:22:53.360 --> 00:22:57.310 align:middle line:84%
And how might this manifest
in more subtle terms?

00:22:57.310 --> 00:23:00.930 align:middle line:84%
Because all of us are surrounded
with other dimensions of beings

00:23:00.930 --> 00:23:01.630 align:middle line:90%
all the time--

00:23:01.630 --> 00:23:02.900 align:middle line:90%
>>PERRON: Right.

00:23:02.900 --> 00:23:05.120 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: --with various
intentions and purposes

00:23:05.120 --> 00:23:06.370 align:middle line:90%
and all of that.

00:23:06.370 --> 00:23:08.640 align:middle line:84%
What might the larger
takeaway message

00:23:08.640 --> 00:23:12.370 align:middle line:84%
be in terms of the
quality of emotions

00:23:12.370 --> 00:23:15.220 align:middle line:84%
we're putting into our
atmosphere and the effect

00:23:15.220 --> 00:23:18.069 align:middle line:84%
on all these others in the
interaction as a result?

00:23:18.069 --> 00:23:19.610 align:middle line:84%
>>PERRON: I tell
people all the time,

00:23:19.610 --> 00:23:22.520 align:middle line:84%
how you comport yourself
in this life matters

00:23:22.520 --> 00:23:23.742 align:middle line:90%
more than you know.

00:23:23.742 --> 00:23:27.960 align:middle line:84%
It has ramifications far
beyond your mortal being.

00:23:27.960 --> 00:23:29.570 align:middle line:90%
This is just a vessel.

00:23:29.570 --> 00:23:30.610 align:middle line:90%
It's all that it is.

00:23:30.610 --> 00:23:34.480 align:middle line:84%
We are essentially, I believe--
I know-- we are essentially

00:23:34.480 --> 00:23:35.960 align:middle line:90%
spiritual beings.

00:23:35.960 --> 00:23:38.650 align:middle line:84%
We're having a temporary
mortal existence.

00:23:38.650 --> 00:23:42.590 align:middle line:84%
I don't know if it's because
we're in this vast classroom,

00:23:42.590 --> 00:23:45.690 align:middle line:84%
and this is where we come
to learn our lessons so

00:23:45.690 --> 00:23:50.080 align:middle line:84%
that we can evolve and
eventually transcend.

00:23:50.080 --> 00:23:53.560 align:middle line:84%
I do believe that we are
in the midst of a new age.

00:23:53.560 --> 00:23:56.980 align:middle line:84%
And I know that that phrase
gets kicked around a lot,

00:23:56.980 --> 00:23:59.730 align:middle line:90%
but it really is true.

00:23:59.730 --> 00:24:04.630 align:middle line:84%
We're in a new awareness, what
many spirituallists regard

00:24:04.630 --> 00:24:07.290 align:middle line:90%
as the ascension.

00:24:07.290 --> 00:24:10.500 align:middle line:84%
My partner George and I do a
show called "World Awakening"

00:24:10.500 --> 00:24:12.600 align:middle line:84%
every Tuesday night
on Blog Talk Radio.

00:24:12.600 --> 00:24:15.560 align:middle line:84%
And what we talk about is
throwing a pebble in the pond

00:24:15.560 --> 00:24:19.510 align:middle line:84%
and watching the concentric
circles go out to the shore,

00:24:19.510 --> 00:24:23.630 align:middle line:84%
and touching many, many lives,
and opening people's minds.

00:24:23.630 --> 00:24:25.930 align:middle line:84%
And last week I
said, George, I think

00:24:25.930 --> 00:24:27.850 align:middle line:84%
I have to go back
and get a boulder.

00:24:27.850 --> 00:24:29.830 align:middle line:90%
I do.

00:24:29.830 --> 00:24:32.730 align:middle line:90%
Because it's time to wake up.

00:24:32.730 --> 00:24:34.449 align:middle line:84%
There's so many
huge issues, and I

00:24:34.449 --> 00:24:35.740 align:middle line:90%
know we'll get into that later.

00:24:35.740 --> 00:24:39.640 align:middle line:84%
But there's so many important
things that we must address,

00:24:39.640 --> 00:24:42.470 align:middle line:90%
or we will perish.

00:24:42.470 --> 00:24:44.200 align:middle line:90%
The Earth will go on.

00:24:44.200 --> 00:24:47.100 align:middle line:84%
It doesn't necessarily mean
that we have to be on it.

00:24:47.100 --> 00:24:47.970 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:24:47.970 --> 00:24:49.970 align:middle line:84%
>>PERRON: So these are the
issues that I address now.

00:24:49.970 --> 00:24:51.553 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Well, and
this is the thing.

00:24:51.553 --> 00:24:56.400 align:middle line:84%
People who are having contact
with other dimensional beings--

00:24:56.400 --> 00:24:59.030 align:middle line:84%
ETs, whatever you want
to call the full spectrum

00:24:59.030 --> 00:25:02.060 align:middle line:84%
of other beings that
are not us-- this

00:25:02.060 --> 00:25:04.980 align:middle line:84%
is the message that
comes up over and over.

00:25:04.980 --> 00:25:06.800 align:middle line:84%
And now this gets
us to the subject

00:25:06.800 --> 00:25:12.940 align:middle line:84%
of UFOs and your contact with
not just the craft, perhaps

00:25:12.940 --> 00:25:13.750 align:middle line:90%
the beings.

00:25:13.750 --> 00:25:15.430 align:middle line:84%
And I want to bridge
this over, even,

00:25:15.430 --> 00:25:18.341 align:middle line:84%
into similar stories are
happening all over the planet.

00:25:18.341 --> 00:25:19.340 align:middle line:90%
>>PERRON: Yes, they are.

00:25:19.340 --> 00:25:20.964 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And the
beings-- whether it's

00:25:20.964 --> 00:25:24.680 align:middle line:84%
telepathic or literal-- are
delivering the same message

00:25:24.680 --> 00:25:26.620 align:middle line:84%
to all of these
people, who are not

00:25:26.620 --> 00:25:28.324 align:middle line:90%
asking for this in their lives.

00:25:28.324 --> 00:25:28.990 align:middle line:90%
>>PERRON: Right.

00:25:28.990 --> 00:25:31.031 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So let's talk
about your own experience

00:25:31.031 --> 00:25:32.230 align:middle line:90%
with the UFOs.

00:25:32.230 --> 00:25:35.580 align:middle line:84%
>>PERRON: Well, let me again
preface my remarks with,

00:25:35.580 --> 00:25:39.290 align:middle line:84%
I used to say everybody--
if one person is psychic,

00:25:39.290 --> 00:25:40.440 align:middle line:90%
everyone is psychic.

00:25:40.440 --> 00:25:44.180 align:middle line:84%
If one person can be a medium,
everyone has that capacity.

00:25:44.180 --> 00:25:48.950 align:middle line:84%
And I have changed my
thinking on that a bit.

00:25:48.950 --> 00:25:51.910 align:middle line:84%
I think that we're all
at different levels.

00:25:51.910 --> 00:25:55.020 align:middle line:84%
Some of us are more
aware than others.

00:25:55.020 --> 00:25:58.120 align:middle line:84%
Some of us, I think, come
to this realm with gifts

00:25:58.120 --> 00:26:01.340 align:middle line:84%
that others might not
possess, or are not

00:26:01.340 --> 00:26:04.040 align:middle line:84%
even aware of that
they could develop.

00:26:04.040 --> 00:26:07.010 align:middle line:84%
And I really have
changed my opinion

00:26:07.010 --> 00:26:08.774 align:middle line:90%
about that in recent years.

00:26:08.774 --> 00:26:10.440 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: May I just
say one thing here?

00:26:10.440 --> 00:26:12.690 align:middle line:84%
Because I know
people call it gifts,

00:26:12.690 --> 00:26:14.980 align:middle line:90%
as though it's endowed on them.

00:26:14.980 --> 00:26:16.367 align:middle line:90%
I don't see it that way.

00:26:16.367 --> 00:26:17.700 align:middle line:90%
>>PERRON: What do you see it as?

00:26:17.700 --> 00:26:20.220 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: I see that
that being has developed

00:26:20.220 --> 00:26:22.610 align:middle line:84%
those aspects of self
enough, through time,

00:26:22.610 --> 00:26:24.170 align:middle line:90%
that they're demonstrating it.

00:26:24.170 --> 00:26:25.850 align:middle line:90%
It's not gifted.

00:26:25.850 --> 00:26:28.830 align:middle line:84%
It isn't endemic to
who that being is.

00:26:28.830 --> 00:26:30.860 align:middle line:84%
>>PERRON: Well,
and I feel-- and I

00:26:30.860 --> 00:26:33.430 align:middle line:84%
agree with you, in
that I feel that it's

00:26:33.430 --> 00:26:34.395 align:middle line:90%
intrinsic to my nature.

00:26:34.395 --> 00:26:35.020 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:26:35.020 --> 00:26:36.394 align:middle line:84%
That's exactly
what I was saying.

00:26:36.394 --> 00:26:39.780 align:middle line:84%
>>PERRON: When I was a little
kid I was telepathically

00:26:39.780 --> 00:26:40.950 align:middle line:90%
communicating.

00:26:40.950 --> 00:26:43.890 align:middle line:90%
I was astral projecting.

00:26:43.890 --> 00:26:46.670 align:middle line:84%
I was having-- and that's
where the whole misfit

00:26:46.670 --> 00:26:50.724 align:middle line:84%
syndrome was, like, I'm
different than other people.

00:26:50.724 --> 00:26:51.390 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:26:51.390 --> 00:26:52.015 align:middle line:90%
>>PERRON: I am.

00:26:52.015 --> 00:26:53.780 align:middle line:84%
And I knew it from
a very young age.

00:26:53.780 --> 00:26:54.450 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Well, I
only bring that up

00:26:54.450 --> 00:26:55.980 align:middle line:84%
for one reason--
the terminology.

00:26:55.980 --> 00:26:59.160 align:middle line:84%
Because there's a disempowering
aspect, in my opinion, to say

00:26:59.160 --> 00:27:00.570 align:middle line:90%
it was a gift.

00:27:00.570 --> 00:27:03.270 align:middle line:84%
Claim it, own it--
whatever talents any of us

00:27:03.270 --> 00:27:04.624 align:middle line:90%
have in any realm of our lives.

00:27:04.624 --> 00:27:07.040 align:middle line:84%
>>PERRON: Yeah, I would have
to agree with you about that.

00:27:07.040 --> 00:27:08.230 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: We have learned
those things somehow.

00:27:08.230 --> 00:27:08.840 align:middle line:84%
>>PERRON: We'll change
the semantics of that.

00:27:08.840 --> 00:27:09.150 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Thank you.

00:27:09.150 --> 00:27:10.100 align:middle line:90%
But go ahead now.

00:27:10.100 --> 00:27:10.750 align:middle line:90%
Yes,

00:27:10.750 --> 00:27:11.375 align:middle line:90%
>>PERRON: Yeah.

00:27:11.375 --> 00:27:13.380 align:middle line:10%
And I knew from a
very young age, well

00:27:13.380 --> 00:27:16.820 align:middle line:10%
before we moved to the farm,
that there was something

00:27:16.820 --> 00:27:18.590 align:middle line:10%
very different about me.

00:27:18.590 --> 00:27:22.050 align:middle line:84%
And I knew that I had a
sense of my own destiny

00:27:22.050 --> 00:27:24.610 align:middle line:90%
from a very young age.

00:27:24.610 --> 00:27:29.180 align:middle line:84%
I wrote my first book
when I was five years old.

00:27:29.180 --> 00:27:32.440 align:middle line:84%
I did my own illustrations,
courtesy of Crayola.

00:27:32.440 --> 00:27:35.620 align:middle line:84%
I knew I was supposed
to be a writer.

00:27:35.620 --> 00:27:37.550 align:middle line:84%
And I found a hundred
different things

00:27:37.550 --> 00:27:41.170 align:middle line:84%
to do in life before I
actually became an author.

00:27:41.170 --> 00:27:41.920 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:27:41.920 --> 00:27:44.910 align:middle line:84%
>>PERRON: And I know that
that was part of my journey.

00:27:44.910 --> 00:27:47.300 align:middle line:84%
All the experiences, all
the people that I met,

00:27:47.300 --> 00:27:51.860 align:middle line:84%
everything-- that it had
a cumulative effect on me.

00:27:51.860 --> 00:27:54.850 align:middle line:84%
I took it in, I
processed it, and then

00:27:54.850 --> 00:28:00.960 align:middle line:84%
I finally was able to focus
on what my purpose was.

00:28:00.960 --> 00:28:02.085 align:middle line:90%
And I knew.

00:28:02.085 --> 00:28:03.710 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So let's
go back to the UFOs,

00:28:03.710 --> 00:28:04.890 align:middle line:90%
because that started early.

00:28:04.890 --> 00:28:05.598 align:middle line:90%
>>PERRON: It did.

00:28:05.598 --> 00:28:08.630 align:middle line:84%
It started at the
farm, and that's

00:28:08.630 --> 00:28:11.580 align:middle line:84%
why I say there's a point of
correlation and integration

00:28:11.580 --> 00:28:12.170 align:middle line:90%
now.

00:28:12.170 --> 00:28:14.740 align:middle line:84%
I will, and I'm
ashamed to say this,

00:28:14.740 --> 00:28:18.460 align:middle line:84%
I really am-- and I'm
sorry that I had not

00:28:18.460 --> 00:28:23.080 align:middle line:84%
evolved enough to understand
this earlier-- but I came out

00:28:23.080 --> 00:28:25.770 align:middle line:84%
of the closet a
couple of years ago.

00:28:25.770 --> 00:28:29.010 align:middle line:84%
I had kept all of
that to myself.

00:28:29.010 --> 00:28:31.390 align:middle line:84%
I did not-- and you
know, you've read

00:28:31.390 --> 00:28:34.230 align:middle line:84%
these books-- there's nothing
about UFOs in these books.

00:28:34.230 --> 00:28:35.670 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: No, there's nothing.

00:28:35.670 --> 00:28:38.003 align:middle line:84%
>>PERRON: But I was doing an
interview a couple of years

00:28:38.003 --> 00:28:40.570 align:middle line:90%
ago for "Mysterious World" TV.

00:28:40.570 --> 00:28:44.060 align:middle line:84%
And Devon Belanger
was interviewing me,

00:28:44.060 --> 00:28:47.254 align:middle line:84%
and we're two-thirds of the way
through a four-hour interview.

00:28:47.254 --> 00:28:48.670 align:middle line:84%
And she turns to
me, and she says,

00:28:48.670 --> 00:28:50.240 align:middle line:84%
have you ever had
any experiences

00:28:50.240 --> 00:28:52.160 align:middle line:90%
with extraterrestrials?

00:28:52.160 --> 00:28:53.660 align:middle line:84%
And I just looked
at her, and then I

00:28:53.660 --> 00:28:55.070 align:middle line:90%
looked into one of the cameras.

00:28:55.070 --> 00:28:59.350 align:middle line:84%
And I said, I'll tell you, but
you can't use this footage.

00:28:59.350 --> 00:29:02.780 align:middle line:84%
And she agreed she wouldn't use
that, but she wanted to know.

00:29:02.780 --> 00:29:08.300 align:middle line:84%
And a week before I had had the
most intense encounter that I'd

00:29:08.300 --> 00:29:10.630 align:middle line:90%
ever had to date in my life.

00:29:10.630 --> 00:29:13.140 align:middle line:90%
And I've had many.

00:29:13.140 --> 00:29:17.890 align:middle line:84%
But a being, an entity,
came between myself

00:29:17.890 --> 00:29:21.410 align:middle line:84%
and the composer of the music
I use for the background

00:29:21.410 --> 00:29:22.620 align:middle line:90%
of my videos.

00:29:22.620 --> 00:29:26.000 align:middle line:84%
Sue McVicker had written
a beautiful piece of music

00:29:26.000 --> 00:29:28.170 align:middle line:84%
for me called "The
Shadows are High,"

00:29:28.170 --> 00:29:29.980 align:middle line:90%
and she called me one day.

00:29:29.980 --> 00:29:31.020 align:middle line:90%
She says, let's Skype.

00:29:31.020 --> 00:29:32.410 align:middle line:90%
I'm ready to play it for you.

00:29:32.410 --> 00:29:33.720 align:middle line:90%
I was, like, great.

00:29:33.720 --> 00:29:36.490 align:middle line:84%
And I'm sitting there,
she's at the piano,

00:29:36.490 --> 00:29:38.170 align:middle line:90%
and I'm sitting there crying.

00:29:38.170 --> 00:29:40.290 align:middle line:84%
The tears are just
pouring out of my eyes,

00:29:40.290 --> 00:29:44.640 align:middle line:84%
and I'm humming along, a piece
of music, a composition I

00:29:44.640 --> 00:29:46.690 align:middle line:90%
had never heard before.

00:29:46.690 --> 00:29:48.330 align:middle line:90%
And I knew every note of it.

00:29:48.330 --> 00:29:50.430 align:middle line:90%
And I don't know how I did.

00:29:50.430 --> 00:29:54.160 align:middle line:84%
And when she
finished, the screen--

00:29:54.160 --> 00:29:58.050 align:middle line:84%
there was horizontal
interference on the screen.

00:29:58.050 --> 00:29:59.240 align:middle line:90%
I use Skype all the time.

00:29:59.240 --> 00:30:00.760 align:middle line:84%
I'm used to
interference on Skype.

00:30:00.760 --> 00:30:01.580 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:30:01.580 --> 00:30:03.470 align:middle line:84%
>>PERRON: And I'm
always, it's the spooks.

00:30:03.470 --> 00:30:05.166 align:middle line:84%
It's the spooks,
they're doing it again.

00:30:05.166 --> 00:30:07.540 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Yes, some weird
stuff happened when you're here

00:30:07.540 --> 00:30:08.730 align:middle line:90%
in the studio last time.

00:30:08.730 --> 00:30:09.702 align:middle line:90%
But anyway, go ahead.

00:30:09.702 --> 00:30:10.640 align:middle line:90%
>>PERRON: It sure did.

00:30:10.640 --> 00:30:11.139 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:30:11.139 --> 00:30:12.850 align:middle line:84%
Everything I touch
that's technical,

00:30:12.850 --> 00:30:16.960 align:middle line:84%
electronic-- it blows
out or something happens.

00:30:16.960 --> 00:30:19.330 align:middle line:90%
But this was different.

00:30:19.330 --> 00:30:21.330 align:middle line:90%
And I said, Sue.

00:30:21.330 --> 00:30:22.190 align:middle line:90%
I could see her.

00:30:22.190 --> 00:30:25.120 align:middle line:84%
She seemed at very much
of a distance from me.

00:30:25.120 --> 00:30:30.600 align:middle line:84%
And then all of a sudden, I
saw what looked like a cross.

00:30:30.600 --> 00:30:34.100 align:middle line:84%
And it looked like
silver or platinum studs.

00:30:34.100 --> 00:30:37.030 align:middle line:84%
And it was over the
head of the entity

00:30:37.030 --> 00:30:41.820 align:middle line:90%
of this creature, this being.

00:30:41.820 --> 00:30:45.480 align:middle line:84%
And the studs went
this way and this way.

00:30:45.480 --> 00:30:46.643 align:middle line:90%
And I heard

00:30:46.643 --> 00:30:49.830 align:middle line:90%
[TAPPING SOUND]

00:30:49.830 --> 00:30:54.290 align:middle line:84%
Like somebody tapping into a
keyboard, but more distinct.

00:30:54.290 --> 00:30:57.350 align:middle line:84%
And then all of a sudden,
the head started lifting up.

00:30:57.350 --> 00:31:00.190 align:middle line:84%
And I could see behind
him panels of lights.

00:31:00.190 --> 00:31:02.830 align:middle line:84%
I knew it was a male,
for some reason.

00:31:02.830 --> 00:31:06.170 align:middle line:84%
Panels of lights with colors
I had not seen before.

00:31:06.170 --> 00:31:08.210 align:middle line:90%
And I was looking into a ship.

00:31:08.210 --> 00:31:10.700 align:middle line:84%
And he raised his
head, and he looked

00:31:10.700 --> 00:31:16.610 align:middle line:84%
at me dead in the eye with
two laser light red orb eyes.

00:31:16.610 --> 00:31:19.040 align:middle line:84%
Now I've seen
extraterrestrial creatures.

00:31:19.040 --> 00:31:22.900 align:middle line:84%
I had not seen one of
these beings before.

00:31:22.900 --> 00:31:26.390 align:middle line:84%
His skin was smooth
as a baby's butt.

00:31:26.390 --> 00:31:28.860 align:middle line:90%
It was black, black high polish.

00:31:28.860 --> 00:31:31.740 align:middle line:90%
It looked like patent leather.

00:31:31.740 --> 00:31:36.450 align:middle line:84%
But no texture to
it-- soft, soft.

00:31:36.450 --> 00:31:38.730 align:middle line:90%
His face was perfectly oval.

00:31:38.730 --> 00:31:42.390 align:middle line:84%
There was no chin, very
thin lips, a small nose.

00:31:42.390 --> 00:31:46.490 align:middle line:84%
But these two eyes, and
they latched into mine.

00:31:46.490 --> 00:31:47.720 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: What happened then?

00:31:47.720 --> 00:31:49.900 align:middle line:84%
For about-- and I
don't know how long.

00:31:49.900 --> 00:31:52.770 align:middle line:10%
Sue said it was between
a minute and two minutes.

00:31:52.770 --> 00:31:54.850 align:middle line:10%
She could see the
back of his head.

00:31:54.850 --> 00:31:56.760 align:middle line:90%
He was looking directly at me.

00:31:56.760 --> 00:32:01.010 align:middle line:84%
And I was being communicated
with, although he never spoke.

00:32:01.010 --> 00:32:05.730 align:middle line:84%
And after, it got so
intense it felt like my-- I

00:32:05.730 --> 00:32:07.790 align:middle line:90%
was having a visceral reaction.

00:32:07.790 --> 00:32:10.190 align:middle line:84%
I broke out into
a full body sweat.

00:32:10.190 --> 00:32:14.090 align:middle line:84%
I felt, like, a trembling,
tremor sensation going on.

00:32:14.090 --> 00:32:18.950 align:middle line:84%
I felt like my vibration, my
own frequency was being altered.

00:32:18.950 --> 00:32:21.240 align:middle line:84%
And then I started fishing
around for the mouse.

00:32:21.240 --> 00:32:22.070 align:middle line:90%
Where's the mouse?

00:32:22.070 --> 00:32:23.710 align:middle line:90%
I could not break the stare.

00:32:23.710 --> 00:32:24.939 align:middle line:90%
I could not.

00:32:24.939 --> 00:32:26.730 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So what were
you getting from it?

00:32:26.730 --> 00:32:27.210 align:middle line:90%
What was--

00:32:27.210 --> 00:32:28.220 align:middle line:90%
>>PERRON: I wish I knew.

00:32:28.220 --> 00:32:28.830 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: You don't know.

00:32:28.830 --> 00:32:30.160 align:middle line:90%
>>PERRON: I wish I knew.

00:32:30.160 --> 00:32:33.070 align:middle line:84%
Maybe I was just being
prepared for what was coming.

00:32:33.070 --> 00:32:37.870 align:middle line:84%
But I finally found my mouse
and I disconnected the call.

00:32:37.870 --> 00:32:40.330 align:middle line:84%
And I'm sorry to
this day that I did.

00:32:40.330 --> 00:32:43.910 align:middle line:84%
But perhaps I was with him as
long as I was supposed to be.

00:32:43.910 --> 00:32:45.450 align:middle line:90%
And Sue called me immediately.

00:32:45.450 --> 00:32:47.510 align:middle line:90%
She's like, what was that?

00:32:47.510 --> 00:32:50.719 align:middle line:84%
And she used some very
colorful language.

00:32:50.719 --> 00:32:51.510 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: I'll bet.

00:32:51.510 --> 00:32:53.420 align:middle line:90%
>>PERRON: I was, like, heaving.

00:32:53.420 --> 00:32:56.710 align:middle line:90%


00:32:56.710 --> 00:32:58.810 align:middle line:90%
It was so overwhelming to me.

00:32:58.810 --> 00:33:01.620 align:middle line:84%
I felt-- and I
wasn't afraid at all.

00:33:01.620 --> 00:33:04.140 align:middle line:84%
There was nothing
fear-based about it.

00:33:04.140 --> 00:33:06.950 align:middle line:84%
But it was as if
everything changed.

00:33:06.950 --> 00:33:08.020 align:middle line:90%
Everything did.

00:33:08.020 --> 00:33:11.690 align:middle line:84%
And that happened a week before
I granted that interview.

00:33:11.690 --> 00:33:14.520 align:middle line:90%
So I had a story to tell her.

00:33:14.520 --> 00:33:17.310 align:middle line:84%
But I made her promise
not to put it out

00:33:17.310 --> 00:33:19.630 align:middle line:84%
while she produced the
video, and sent it to me

00:33:19.630 --> 00:33:20.870 align:middle line:90%
six months later.

00:33:20.870 --> 00:33:22.280 align:middle line:90%
And with it came a note.

00:33:22.280 --> 00:33:24.700 align:middle line:84%
She sent it to mean
in a private YouTube.

00:33:24.700 --> 00:33:26.290 align:middle line:84%
She said, I need
you to review it.

00:33:26.290 --> 00:33:29.030 align:middle line:84%
She had whittled it
down to two hours.

00:33:29.030 --> 00:33:31.480 align:middle line:84%
And she said, I need you
to review this, and please

00:33:31.480 --> 00:33:33.059 align:middle line:90%
say yes.

00:33:33.059 --> 00:33:33.600 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: OK.

00:33:33.600 --> 00:33:36.214 align:middle line:84%
>>PERRON: I knew instantly
what was included.

00:33:36.214 --> 00:33:37.880 align:middle line:84%
And that was a big
leap of faith for me,

00:33:37.880 --> 00:33:39.670 align:middle line:84%
because it went out
all over the world.

00:33:39.670 --> 00:33:40.253 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:33:40.253 --> 00:33:42.620 align:middle line:84%
>>PERRON: So people now
not only associate me

00:33:42.620 --> 00:33:45.420 align:middle line:84%
with the ghosts and
the spirits, they also

00:33:45.420 --> 00:33:48.490 align:middle line:90%
know that I am a contactee.

00:33:48.490 --> 00:33:52.640 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: You told me off
camera you have gone voluntarily

00:33:52.640 --> 00:33:55.060 align:middle line:90%
aboard ships to other places.

00:33:55.060 --> 00:33:55.800 align:middle line:90%
>>PERRON: I have.

00:33:55.800 --> 00:34:00.310 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And can you talk
about a little bit of that?

00:34:00.310 --> 00:34:01.550 align:middle line:90%
>>PERRON: Well, one of them--

00:34:01.550 --> 00:34:02.966 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Of what
you were shown--

00:34:02.966 --> 00:34:06.360 align:middle line:84%
things that might be
relevant to most of us.

00:34:06.360 --> 00:34:08.989 align:middle line:84%
>>PERRON: I will tell you
that when I was 17 years old,

00:34:08.989 --> 00:34:12.290 align:middle line:84%
and I saw "Close Encounters
of the Third Kind,"

00:34:12.290 --> 00:34:14.260 align:middle line:84%
it was so emotionally
impactful--

00:34:14.260 --> 00:34:19.380 align:middle line:84%
and Paola Harris will tell you
the same thing-- I sat there,

00:34:19.380 --> 00:34:21.525 align:middle line:84%
I was with my two dear
friends Tim and Ray,

00:34:21.525 --> 00:34:23.900 align:middle line:84%
and I'm watching this film in
the big theater in Lincoln,

00:34:23.900 --> 00:34:25.050 align:middle line:90%
Rhode Island.

00:34:25.050 --> 00:34:29.159 align:middle line:84%
And at the end, when the
being comes out of the ship

00:34:29.159 --> 00:34:32.030 align:middle line:84%
and opens her arms,
I was, like, let

00:34:32.030 --> 00:34:33.719 align:middle line:90%
me crawl into the that screen.

00:34:33.719 --> 00:34:34.679 align:middle line:90%
Mom!

00:34:34.679 --> 00:34:37.510 align:middle line:84%
I felt such an
overwhelming sense

00:34:37.510 --> 00:34:41.920 align:middle line:84%
of belonging to that tall,
white, beautiful being,

00:34:41.920 --> 00:34:42.510 align:middle line:90%
and I knew.

00:34:42.510 --> 00:34:43.770 align:middle line:90%
We walked out of that theater.

00:34:43.770 --> 00:34:46.139 align:middle line:84%
The tears are pouring--
I'm a cry baby, anyway--

00:34:46.139 --> 00:34:48.560 align:middle line:84%
but the tears were
pouring off my face.

00:34:48.560 --> 00:34:50.659 align:middle line:84%
And Tim and Ray are,
like, are you OK?

00:34:50.659 --> 00:34:51.360 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:34:51.360 --> 00:34:53.219 align:middle line:84%
>>PERRON: Annie, it
was only a movie.

00:34:53.219 --> 00:34:55.989 align:middle line:84%
I'm, like, no, you
don't understand.

00:34:55.989 --> 00:34:59.290 align:middle line:84%
Everything-- that might as
well have been a documentary.

00:34:59.290 --> 00:35:01.950 align:middle line:84%
The only thing that was
different in that film

00:35:01.950 --> 00:35:05.820 align:middle line:84%
than reality was that the
exchange didn't happen

00:35:05.820 --> 00:35:07.570 align:middle line:90%
at Devils Tower, Wyoming.

00:35:07.570 --> 00:35:10.150 align:middle line:84%
It happened northwest
of Las Vegas

00:35:10.150 --> 00:35:14.600 align:middle line:84%
at a military Air Force
base, at an air installation.

00:35:14.600 --> 00:35:17.270 align:middle line:84%
But everything in that film,
according to Paul Hellyer,

00:35:17.270 --> 00:35:18.970 align:middle line:90%
is absolutely accurate.

00:35:18.970 --> 00:35:19.620 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:35:19.620 --> 00:35:22.970 align:middle line:84%
>>PERRON: And that's part
of the priming of the pump.

00:35:22.970 --> 00:35:23.770 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Exactly.

00:35:23.770 --> 00:35:26.520 align:middle line:84%
It's preparing people to
understand this is real.

00:35:26.520 --> 00:35:29.411 align:middle line:84%
This is going to be occurring
in your future, as time goes on.

00:35:29.411 --> 00:35:31.535 align:middle line:84%
So how did you originally
start coming into contact

00:35:31.535 --> 00:35:32.360 align:middle line:90%
with the UFOs?

00:35:32.360 --> 00:35:35.480 align:middle line:84%
>>PERRON: When I was 13 years
old, we'd only been at the farm

00:35:35.480 --> 00:35:35.980 align:middle line:90%
a year.

00:35:35.980 --> 00:35:39.770 align:middle line:90%
It was our first summer there.

00:35:39.770 --> 00:35:42.970 align:middle line:84%
I don't know why, but I was out
in the middle of the front yard

00:35:42.970 --> 00:35:43.990 align:middle line:90%
at the farm.

00:35:43.990 --> 00:35:48.760 align:middle line:84%
And there are three very large
evergreen trees out there,

00:35:48.760 --> 00:35:50.730 align:middle line:90%
and a very expansive yard.

00:35:50.730 --> 00:35:54.700 align:middle line:84%
It was a bright blue Canadian
sky that day in Rhode Island.

00:35:54.700 --> 00:35:56.270 align:middle line:90%
You know what I'm talking about.

00:35:56.270 --> 00:35:58.790 align:middle line:84%
So blue it almost
hurts to look at it.

00:35:58.790 --> 00:36:01.880 align:middle line:84%
And I was just looking around,
and it was so beautiful.

00:36:01.880 --> 00:36:03.880 align:middle line:84%
And it was getting
toward sunset,

00:36:03.880 --> 00:36:06.100 align:middle line:90%
and it was so warm and lovely.

00:36:06.100 --> 00:36:10.920 align:middle line:84%
And all of a sudden,
I felt like there

00:36:10.920 --> 00:36:12.370 align:middle line:90%
was something moving around me.

00:36:12.370 --> 00:36:15.000 align:middle line:84%
And I looked down, and
there was nothing around me.

00:36:15.000 --> 00:36:16.580 align:middle line:84%
And then I looked
back up at the sky,

00:36:16.580 --> 00:36:19.520 align:middle line:84%
and it was filled-- it looked
like God had poured out

00:36:19.520 --> 00:36:22.690 align:middle line:84%
the biggest bag of cotton balls
you could ever imagine out

00:36:22.690 --> 00:36:23.340 align:middle line:90%
into the sky.

00:36:23.340 --> 00:36:25.950 align:middle line:84%
Just puffy,
weird-looking clouds.

00:36:25.950 --> 00:36:27.900 align:middle line:84%
And the sun was
setting behind me,

00:36:27.900 --> 00:36:30.830 align:middle line:84%
and they had colors of
rainbows through them.

00:36:30.830 --> 00:36:34.080 align:middle line:90%
Just-- I can't really explain.

00:36:34.080 --> 00:36:37.210 align:middle line:84%
It was just-- they were golden,
and they were mauve, and pink,

00:36:37.210 --> 00:36:40.120 align:middle line:90%
and lovely, beautiful sky.

00:36:40.120 --> 00:36:42.980 align:middle line:84%
And then, all of a sudden,
it started getting dark.

00:36:42.980 --> 00:36:45.880 align:middle line:84%
And being a flexible
young lady, I

00:36:45.880 --> 00:36:48.650 align:middle line:84%
was able to lift my
head all the way back.

00:36:48.650 --> 00:36:52.390 align:middle line:84%
And over my head,
I saw the point

00:36:52.390 --> 00:36:56.930 align:middle line:84%
of a vehicle coming
over my head.

00:36:56.930 --> 00:36:59.970 align:middle line:90%
And it was not that far up.

00:36:59.970 --> 00:37:01.262 align:middle line:90%
It was pretty low.

00:37:01.262 --> 00:37:02.720 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: What was
the shape of it?

00:37:02.720 --> 00:37:04.150 align:middle line:90%
>>PERRON: It came to a point.

00:37:04.150 --> 00:37:08.070 align:middle line:84%
And then as it came out, it
rounded around to the side,

00:37:08.070 --> 00:37:08.570 align:middle line:90%
to the back.

00:37:08.570 --> 00:37:09.990 align:middle line:90%
And then it had a flat back.

00:37:09.990 --> 00:37:10.810 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: OK.

00:37:10.810 --> 00:37:14.690 align:middle line:84%
>>PERRON: And it was surrounded
by a number of smaller

00:37:14.690 --> 00:37:16.050 align:middle line:90%
vehicles-- much smaller.

00:37:16.050 --> 00:37:20.290 align:middle line:84%
And each one of them was a
perfect geometrical form.

00:37:20.290 --> 00:37:24.690 align:middle line:84%
Whether it was a
perfect circle, octagon,

00:37:24.690 --> 00:37:30.090 align:middle line:84%
pentagon-- there were some
that looked like rectangles,

00:37:30.090 --> 00:37:31.880 align:middle line:90%
only angled.

00:37:31.880 --> 00:37:36.050 align:middle line:84%
It was like a math class
was passing over my head.

00:37:36.050 --> 00:37:39.000 align:middle line:90%
And not a sound.

00:37:39.000 --> 00:37:43.660 align:middle line:84%
But not only did this flotilla
of ships not make a sound,

00:37:43.660 --> 00:37:46.050 align:middle line:90%
nature went silent.

00:37:46.050 --> 00:37:48.030 align:middle line:90%
Even the birds were silent.

00:37:48.030 --> 00:37:51.150 align:middle line:84%
Everything was
completely silent,

00:37:51.150 --> 00:37:54.169 align:middle line:84%
and I could hear this kind
of odd buzzing in my ears.

00:37:54.169 --> 00:37:55.710 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Were you
there by yourself?

00:37:55.710 --> 00:37:57.335 align:middle line:84%
>>PERRON: And that's
the weirdest thing

00:37:57.335 --> 00:37:59.600 align:middle line:84%
of all, because I was
never alone at the farm.

00:37:59.600 --> 00:38:00.266 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:38:00.266 --> 00:38:03.300 align:middle line:84%
>>PERRON: There were always
kids everywhere, and activity,

00:38:03.300 --> 00:38:06.180 align:middle line:84%
and animals, and all kinds
of activity all the time.

00:38:06.180 --> 00:38:09.420 align:middle line:84%
And I was standing alone,
and I thought, maybe

00:38:09.420 --> 00:38:11.300 align:middle line:90%
I'm supposed to see this.

00:38:11.300 --> 00:38:13.710 align:middle line:84%
And it wasn't
until decades later

00:38:13.710 --> 00:38:16.720 align:middle line:84%
that I realized, through
numerous other reports,

00:38:16.720 --> 00:38:19.680 align:middle line:84%
that many people
saw that flotilla.

00:38:19.680 --> 00:38:23.990 align:middle line:84%
And after, it went as far
south on the Eastern Seaboard

00:38:23.990 --> 00:38:27.120 align:middle line:84%
as, like, southern
Jersey, or Maryland.

00:38:27.120 --> 00:38:29.930 align:middle line:84%
And then it crossed
over the Atlantic Ocean,

00:38:29.930 --> 00:38:31.660 align:middle line:90%
went into Western Europe.

00:38:31.660 --> 00:38:33.720 align:middle line:84%
And when it went
over the UK, they

00:38:33.720 --> 00:38:36.824 align:middle line:84%
started scrambling
their Air Force.

00:38:36.824 --> 00:38:37.490 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:38:37.490 --> 00:38:39.660 align:middle line:84%
>>PERRON: And it took
a hard right turn

00:38:39.660 --> 00:38:41.904 align:middle line:84%
and disappeared, up
over the Arctic Circle.

00:38:41.904 --> 00:38:43.570 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So what did
it leave you with,

00:38:43.570 --> 00:38:46.050 align:middle line:84%
as a 13-year-old witnessing
this for the first time?

00:38:46.050 --> 00:38:48.890 align:middle line:84%
And you had another phenomena
going on around you, obviously.

00:38:48.890 --> 00:38:53.470 align:middle line:84%
>>PERRON: When Steve Jobs died,
his last words were, "Wow,

00:38:53.470 --> 00:38:56.740 align:middle line:90%
wow, wow."

00:38:56.740 --> 00:38:58.410 align:middle line:90%
That was my reaction.

00:38:58.410 --> 00:38:59.390 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Wow.

00:38:59.390 --> 00:39:00.630 align:middle line:90%
Wow.

00:39:00.630 --> 00:39:01.320 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:39:01.320 --> 00:39:04.250 align:middle line:90%
Now let's go back to the farm.

00:39:04.250 --> 00:39:06.560 align:middle line:84%
Let's go back to the
house a little bit.

00:39:06.560 --> 00:39:09.220 align:middle line:84%
I wanted to bring up, at
some point-- Ann Andrews.

00:39:09.220 --> 00:39:12.150 align:middle line:84%
I interviewed her in
England, from Lincolnshire.

00:39:12.150 --> 00:39:14.640 align:middle line:84%
And her son Jason
is also a contactee,

00:39:14.640 --> 00:39:17.000 align:middle line:84%
but had these strange
experiences in the house.

00:39:17.000 --> 00:39:21.130 align:middle line:84%
I mean, people who have
seen that interview--

00:39:21.130 --> 00:39:22.650 align:middle line:90%
the house just starts shaking.

00:39:22.650 --> 00:39:24.140 align:middle line:84%
And he goes into
an altered state

00:39:24.140 --> 00:39:29.290 align:middle line:84%
and starts reciting digital
code, literally-- binary code.

00:39:29.290 --> 00:39:31.390 align:middle line:84%
And his parents are,
what is happening?

00:39:31.390 --> 00:39:35.030 align:middle line:84%
And then later, over the years,
finding out he had been taken.

00:39:35.030 --> 00:39:37.510 align:middle line:84%
He was a contactee
throughout his whole life.

00:39:37.510 --> 00:39:39.647 align:middle line:84%
And the phenomenon that
was happening in the house,

00:39:39.647 --> 00:39:40.980 align:middle line:90%
they were attributing to ghosts.

00:39:40.980 --> 00:39:44.040 align:middle line:84%
But actually it was this
inter-dimensional contact

00:39:44.040 --> 00:39:46.680 align:middle line:90%
from another species of beings.

00:39:46.680 --> 00:39:48.750 align:middle line:90%
So now-- yes, go ahead.

00:39:48.750 --> 00:39:50.280 align:middle line:90%
>>PERRON: Let me ask you this.

00:39:50.280 --> 00:39:52.650 align:middle line:84%
When you go to symposiums
like I attend--

00:39:52.650 --> 00:39:56.890 align:middle line:84%
I'm going to Laughlin next
weekend with Paola-- if you go

00:39:56.890 --> 00:40:00.340 align:middle line:84%
into that room of people,
and you say, how many of you

00:40:00.340 --> 00:40:01.680 align:middle line:90%
are first-born?

00:40:01.680 --> 00:40:03.600 align:middle line:90%
Watch how many hands go up.

00:40:03.600 --> 00:40:05.470 align:middle line:84%
How many have blue
or green eyes?

00:40:05.470 --> 00:40:07.470 align:middle line:90%
Watch how many hands go up.

00:40:07.470 --> 00:40:10.420 align:middle line:84%
How many of you have the
Rh negative blood factor?

00:40:10.420 --> 00:40:11.864 align:middle line:90%
Watch how many hands go up.

00:40:11.864 --> 00:40:12.780 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Interesting.

00:40:12.780 --> 00:40:14.962 align:middle line:84%
Well, I assume you will do
that when you get there.

00:40:14.962 --> 00:40:15.920 align:middle line:90%
I'll leave that to you.

00:40:15.920 --> 00:40:19.630 align:middle line:84%
>>PERRON: And that falls into
my category-- first-born,

00:40:19.630 --> 00:40:22.060 align:middle line:84%
Rh negative blood
factor, blue eyes.

00:40:22.060 --> 00:40:25.134 align:middle line:84%
And everybody in my family
has it, except my father.

00:40:25.134 --> 00:40:26.050 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Interesting.

00:40:26.050 --> 00:40:27.070 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:40:27.070 --> 00:40:30.100 align:middle line:84%
Now let's talk about a
deeper kind of interface.

00:40:30.100 --> 00:40:31.750 align:middle line:84%
And this is one that
frightens people.

00:40:31.750 --> 00:40:34.880 align:middle line:90%
It terrified you at the time.

00:40:34.880 --> 00:40:36.430 align:middle line:90%
Your sister in this was Cindy.

00:40:36.430 --> 00:40:39.960 align:middle line:84%
Was this-- no, this was
Cindy witnessing something

00:40:39.960 --> 00:40:41.220 align:middle line:90%
that happened to Chris.

00:40:41.220 --> 00:40:42.270 align:middle line:84%
I have to keep all
the girls straight.

00:40:42.270 --> 00:40:44.603 align:middle line:84%
>>PERRON: Yes, I know exactly
what you're talking about.

00:40:44.603 --> 00:40:48.090 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Now I
couldn't quite fathom

00:40:48.090 --> 00:40:50.920 align:middle line:84%
going through what Cindy
went through, in witnessing

00:40:50.920 --> 00:40:52.280 align:middle line:90%
this in her own sister.

00:40:52.280 --> 00:40:55.480 align:middle line:84%
And I want you to share
what that event was.

00:40:55.480 --> 00:40:58.300 align:middle line:84%
And then now, after all those
years, what you perceive

00:40:58.300 --> 00:41:00.930 align:middle line:90%
was happening.

00:41:00.930 --> 00:41:03.940 align:middle line:84%
>>PERRON: Christine
never spoke about that

00:41:03.940 --> 00:41:05.930 align:middle line:90%
and has no recollection of it.

00:41:05.930 --> 00:41:08.380 align:middle line:84%
Cindy was laying in
the bed next to her,

00:41:08.380 --> 00:41:14.470 align:middle line:84%
and she heard moaning,
almost a crying out.

00:41:14.470 --> 00:41:17.310 align:middle line:84%
She turned over, and
she looked at Chris,

00:41:17.310 --> 00:41:21.600 align:middle line:84%
and she saw activity
under her skin, what

00:41:21.600 --> 00:41:24.280 align:middle line:84%
looked as if
something in her face

00:41:24.280 --> 00:41:28.390 align:middle line:84%
was literally trying to
transform her or protrude

00:41:28.390 --> 00:41:29.205 align:middle line:90%
through the skin.

00:41:29.205 --> 00:41:30.871 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Like something
crawling under,

00:41:30.871 --> 00:41:32.400 align:middle line:90%
moving under the skin.

00:41:32.400 --> 00:41:34.730 align:middle line:90%
>>PERRON: And Chris was moaning.

00:41:34.730 --> 00:41:37.960 align:middle line:90%
It was obviously painful to her.

00:41:37.960 --> 00:41:41.280 align:middle line:84%
Cindy was trying to wake
her up, and could not,

00:41:41.280 --> 00:41:48.590 align:middle line:84%
and was so terrified that
she ran downstairs and told

00:41:48.590 --> 00:41:49.240 align:middle line:90%
my mother.

00:41:49.240 --> 00:41:53.620 align:middle line:84%
And my mother sent
my father upstairs.

00:41:53.620 --> 00:41:56.380 align:middle line:84%
Cindy thought that
Chris had perished.

00:41:56.380 --> 00:41:58.019 align:middle line:90%
She seemed in so much pain.

00:41:58.019 --> 00:41:59.560 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: But her
eyes-- in her eyes.

00:41:59.560 --> 00:42:02.350 align:middle line:84%
>>PERRON: Her eyes
were black, vacant.

00:42:02.350 --> 00:42:07.050 align:middle line:84%
She opened her eyes, and that's
what bolted Cindy out of bed

00:42:07.050 --> 00:42:12.180 align:middle line:84%
and sent her downstairs into the
kitchen, hunting a parent down.

00:42:12.180 --> 00:42:15.850 align:middle line:84%
And my mother got
very alarmed, and she

00:42:15.850 --> 00:42:18.170 align:middle line:90%
said, Roger, go get Chris.

00:42:18.170 --> 00:42:22.010 align:middle line:84%
And he went upstairs
and he found Christine.

00:42:22.010 --> 00:42:26.600 align:middle line:84%
And she was-- he had to wake
her up, but she appeared fine.

00:42:26.600 --> 00:42:29.770 align:middle line:84%
And when he escorted her
down into the kitchen,

00:42:29.770 --> 00:42:34.430 align:middle line:84%
my mother said it looked
like she had aged 100 years.

00:42:34.430 --> 00:42:37.773 align:middle line:84%
She was just a child,
but she looked ancient.

00:42:37.773 --> 00:42:40.410 align:middle line:90%


00:42:40.410 --> 00:42:45.000 align:middle line:84%
And my father was
very upset, because we

00:42:45.000 --> 00:42:48.210 align:middle line:84%
had electric blankets
that he had bought for us.

00:42:48.210 --> 00:42:53.080 align:middle line:84%
And when he went upstairs,
he saw that the blankets

00:42:53.080 --> 00:42:55.220 align:middle line:90%
were burned-- the outside edge.

00:42:55.220 --> 00:42:58.010 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: This fire thing
seems to appear repeatedly

00:42:58.010 --> 00:43:00.140 align:middle line:90%
throughout the family history.

00:43:00.140 --> 00:43:02.150 align:middle line:84%
>>PERRON: And what's a
mother's greatest fear,

00:43:02.150 --> 00:43:06.000 align:middle line:84%
than to think her children
are burning alive in bed?

00:43:06.000 --> 00:43:06.940 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:43:06.940 --> 00:43:10.730 align:middle line:84%
And so this was really,
again-- this whole thing

00:43:10.730 --> 00:43:11.500 align:middle line:90%
with your mother.

00:43:11.500 --> 00:43:14.250 align:middle line:84%
I mean, it would make sense
that your mother would

00:43:14.250 --> 00:43:16.914 align:middle line:84%
have been in a most-- that you
said your father was earlier--

00:43:16.914 --> 00:43:18.080 align:middle line:90%
the greatest amount of fear.

00:43:18.080 --> 00:43:19.746 align:middle line:84%
Because she was fearing
for her children

00:43:19.746 --> 00:43:21.190 align:middle line:90%
as their guardian and protector.

00:43:21.190 --> 00:43:23.740 align:middle line:84%
And your father was away most
the time, it sounds like.

00:43:23.740 --> 00:43:26.630 align:middle line:84%
And so she's the
one that, even more

00:43:26.630 --> 00:43:28.810 align:middle line:90%
so-- finish that story, though.

00:43:28.810 --> 00:43:29.550 align:middle line:90%
What happened?

00:43:29.550 --> 00:43:31.950 align:middle line:84%
I mean, Christine
ultimately woke up.

00:43:31.950 --> 00:43:34.329 align:middle line:84%
>>PERRON: Yeah, she woke up,
and she sat very quietly.

00:43:34.329 --> 00:43:36.870 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: All her energy and
her features returned to normal?

00:43:36.870 --> 00:43:37.870 align:middle line:90%
>>PERRON: Yes, they did.

00:43:37.870 --> 00:43:40.560 align:middle line:84%
And she just sat there
and ate a bowl of oatmeal.

00:43:40.560 --> 00:43:42.360 align:middle line:90%
But she was exhausted.

00:43:42.360 --> 00:43:45.790 align:middle line:84%
It was as though she didn't
actually really wake up.

00:43:45.790 --> 00:43:47.700 align:middle line:84%
I mean, her head was
literally falling

00:43:47.700 --> 00:43:51.400 align:middle line:90%
into the bowl of oatmeal.

00:43:51.400 --> 00:43:53.340 align:middle line:84%
All the energy had
been drained from her.

00:43:53.340 --> 00:43:54.420 align:middle line:90%
That's what they did.

00:43:54.420 --> 00:43:56.680 align:middle line:84%
I mean, think of
five little girls

00:43:56.680 --> 00:43:57.850 align:middle line:90%
moving into that farmhouse.

00:43:57.850 --> 00:44:01.220 align:middle line:84%
We were just a constant
source of energy.

00:44:01.220 --> 00:44:04.360 align:middle line:84%
They didn't have to drain it
from the electrical system.

00:44:04.360 --> 00:44:05.985 align:middle line:90%
They had us.

00:44:05.985 --> 00:44:06.610 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:44:06.610 --> 00:44:08.484 align:middle line:84%
But we're going to get
into that talk later--

00:44:08.484 --> 00:44:10.430 align:middle line:84%
the whole electrical
nature of all of this.

00:44:10.430 --> 00:44:12.990 align:middle line:84%
Because they did drain
from the house, as well.

00:44:12.990 --> 00:44:16.630 align:middle line:84%
And then your mother was
undergoing these attacks

00:44:16.630 --> 00:44:18.480 align:middle line:90%
more often, it sounds like.

00:44:18.480 --> 00:44:19.720 align:middle line:90%
>>PERRON: No, not very often.

00:44:19.720 --> 00:44:21.500 align:middle line:84%
Cindy was the one that
was being drained.

00:44:21.500 --> 00:44:21.820 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: More than your mother?

00:44:21.820 --> 00:44:22.445 align:middle line:90%
>>PERRON: Yeah.

00:44:22.445 --> 00:44:28.720 align:middle line:84%
In fact, I believe it's in the
first book, the chapter called

00:44:28.720 --> 00:44:29.830 align:middle line:90%
"Contact."

00:44:29.830 --> 00:44:34.360 align:middle line:84%
And that was the first
physical contact that occurred.

00:44:34.360 --> 00:44:35.580 align:middle line:90%
The bus was waiting.

00:44:35.580 --> 00:44:36.930 align:middle line:90%
We were all heading out.

00:44:36.930 --> 00:44:39.560 align:middle line:84%
Cindy had forgotten her
books on my staircase,

00:44:39.560 --> 00:44:40.930 align:middle line:90%
coming downstairs.

00:44:40.930 --> 00:44:43.850 align:middle line:84%
And she ran through the
kitchen, not thinking anything

00:44:43.850 --> 00:44:45.494 align:middle line:84%
but I need to get
out to the bus.

00:44:45.494 --> 00:44:46.160 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:44:46.160 --> 00:44:49.020 align:middle line:84%
>>PERRON: And something
came through the cellar door

00:44:49.020 --> 00:44:50.340 align:middle line:90%
and began to manifest.

00:44:50.340 --> 00:44:52.250 align:middle line:90%
It was extremely cold.

00:44:52.250 --> 00:44:55.880 align:middle line:84%
And when she ran into it, it
literally knocked her back

00:44:55.880 --> 00:44:59.190 align:middle line:90%
and took her breath away.

00:44:59.190 --> 00:45:02.310 align:middle line:84%
And that was her first physical
contact with an entity,

00:45:02.310 --> 00:45:05.105 align:middle line:84%
or some type of
manifestation, apparition.

00:45:05.105 --> 00:45:06.605 align:middle line:84%
It wasn't even
really an apparition.

00:45:06.605 --> 00:45:09.700 align:middle line:90%
It was more like a ball of fog.

00:45:09.700 --> 00:45:14.430 align:middle line:84%
And she ran, and
got her books off

00:45:14.430 --> 00:45:17.610 align:middle line:84%
of what was our shared staircase
up to the middle bedroom,

00:45:17.610 --> 00:45:21.510 align:middle line:84%
as well as my own, and ran out
to the bus, and got on the bus.

00:45:21.510 --> 00:45:24.770 align:middle line:84%
And she just seemed,
like, lethargic.

00:45:24.770 --> 00:45:28.010 align:middle line:84%
Like, all of a sudden, my
little ball of energy sister

00:45:28.010 --> 00:45:29.607 align:middle line:90%
was just wiped out.

00:45:29.607 --> 00:45:30.940 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: So constantly energy--

00:45:30.940 --> 00:45:32.398 align:middle line:84%
>>PERRON: They had
to come get her.

00:45:32.398 --> 00:45:34.490 align:middle line:84%
Mom had to come get her
an hour later from school,

00:45:34.490 --> 00:45:36.280 align:middle line:84%
and she slept for
24 hours straight.

00:45:36.280 --> 00:45:37.640 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: I remember that story.

00:45:37.640 --> 00:45:38.141 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

00:45:38.141 --> 00:45:40.140 align:middle line:84%
And your mother was
becoming weaker and weaker--

00:45:40.140 --> 00:45:40.910 align:middle line:90%
>>PERRON: Weaker and weaker.

00:45:40.910 --> 00:45:42.076 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: --as time goes on.

00:45:42.076 --> 00:45:44.010 align:middle line:84%
And there was one
event-- smoke appearing.

00:45:44.010 --> 00:45:46.914 align:middle line:84%
Your mother finally screaming
out, asking for help,

00:45:46.914 --> 00:45:48.080 align:middle line:90%
seemed to stop these things.

00:45:48.080 --> 00:45:51.220 align:middle line:84%
>>PERRON: There were two
major incidents around that.

00:45:51.220 --> 00:45:53.640 align:middle line:84%
One chapter, "Smoke
and Mirrors"-- Mom

00:45:53.640 --> 00:45:55.820 align:middle line:84%
had closed up the
fireplace for the evening.

00:45:55.820 --> 00:45:56.560 align:middle line:90%
She went to bed.

00:45:56.560 --> 00:45:57.810 align:middle line:90%
She was home alone that night.

00:45:57.810 --> 00:45:59.167 align:middle line:90%
Dad was on the road.

00:45:59.167 --> 00:46:00.250 align:middle line:90%
He was a jewelry salesman.

00:46:00.250 --> 00:46:02.030 align:middle line:90%
He was out.

00:46:02.030 --> 00:46:05.220 align:middle line:84%
Not a truck driver, as it
was referred to in the film.

00:46:05.220 --> 00:46:08.610 align:middle line:84%
And she got into bed, got under
the quilt. And all of a sudden,

00:46:08.610 --> 00:46:11.940 align:middle line:84%
she saw what looked
like fireworks popping

00:46:11.940 --> 00:46:15.140 align:middle line:84%
all over on the
dresser top, and she

00:46:15.140 --> 00:46:17.910 align:middle line:84%
could see the reflection
of it in the mirror.

00:46:17.910 --> 00:46:20.610 align:middle line:84%
And she got really
afraid, because she

00:46:20.610 --> 00:46:25.870 align:middle line:84%
had a quilt that was a
lace top and lace curtains.

00:46:25.870 --> 00:46:28.210 align:middle line:84%
And these sparks were
just flying everywhere.

00:46:28.210 --> 00:46:29.660 align:middle line:90%
Sparks everywhere.

00:46:29.660 --> 00:46:33.030 align:middle line:84%
And she sat up in bed, and
looked out, thinking perhaps

00:46:33.030 --> 00:46:37.860 align:middle line:84%
it was a reflection-- the fire
had rekindled in the fireplace,

00:46:37.860 --> 00:46:39.870 align:middle line:84%
and she was seeing
a reflection of it.

00:46:39.870 --> 00:46:42.810 align:middle line:84%
But it was actually
more like a fireball

00:46:42.810 --> 00:46:44.980 align:middle line:84%
that was exploding
all over her room.

00:46:44.980 --> 00:46:48.160 align:middle line:84%
But it was centered
on the dresser top.

00:46:48.160 --> 00:46:49.232 align:middle line:90%
And--

00:46:49.232 --> 00:46:50.690 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And were
there incidences

00:46:50.690 --> 00:46:53.290 align:middle line:84%
where the whole room
is filling with smoke,

00:46:53.290 --> 00:46:55.595 align:middle line:84%
flames seemed to be
flickering up around?

00:46:55.595 --> 00:46:57.220 align:middle line:84%
>>PERRON: Yes, and
that was part of it.

00:46:57.220 --> 00:46:58.770 align:middle line:84%
The whole room
filled with smoke.

00:46:58.770 --> 00:46:59.880 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:46:59.880 --> 00:47:02.740 align:middle line:84%
>>PERRON: And she thought
they were going up in flames.

00:47:02.740 --> 00:47:05.167 align:middle line:84%
But she did not know
what was causing this.

00:47:05.167 --> 00:47:05.750 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:47:05.750 --> 00:47:08.290 align:middle line:84%
>>PERRON: There was
no sign of-- she

00:47:08.290 --> 00:47:10.670 align:middle line:84%
said it looked like
a fireball that

00:47:10.670 --> 00:47:12.730 align:middle line:90%
was exploding on the dresser.

00:47:12.730 --> 00:47:15.290 align:middle line:84%
But it was shooting, and
it was hitting the quilt,

00:47:15.290 --> 00:47:17.060 align:middle line:90%
it was hitting the curtains.

00:47:17.060 --> 00:47:21.561 align:middle line:84%
And yet when it stopped, there
were no signs of it at all.

00:47:21.561 --> 00:47:22.060 align:middle line:90%
It was gone.

00:47:22.060 --> 00:47:22.810 align:middle line:90%
There was nothing.

00:47:22.810 --> 00:47:25.170 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And didn't she--
hadn't she started resorting

00:47:25.170 --> 00:47:28.914 align:middle line:84%
to using prayer, in
just calling in--

00:47:28.914 --> 00:47:29.830 align:middle line:90%
>>PERRON: God help me.

00:47:29.830 --> 00:47:31.624 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: God help
me, and it stopped.

00:47:31.624 --> 00:47:32.290 align:middle line:90%
>>PERRON: Mm hm.

00:47:32.290 --> 00:47:34.580 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Now this was happening
with other people, too.

00:47:34.580 --> 00:47:35.890 align:middle line:84%
>>PERRON: Everyone
in the family.

00:47:35.890 --> 00:47:36.890 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: We need
to talk about that.

00:47:36.890 --> 00:47:37.570 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:47:37.570 --> 00:47:38.195 align:middle line:90%
>>PERRON: Yeah.

00:47:38.195 --> 00:47:41.850 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So here you have
these entities behaving badly,

00:47:41.850 --> 00:47:44.690 align:middle line:84%
creating phenomena that is
beyond our comprehension

00:47:44.690 --> 00:47:47.300 align:middle line:84%
in the physical
third-dimensional reality,

00:47:47.300 --> 00:47:49.220 align:middle line:84%
as far as you could
see-- as far as what

00:47:49.220 --> 00:47:50.890 align:middle line:90%
you thought was going on.

00:47:50.890 --> 00:47:52.845 align:middle line:84%
And yet all it took
was, God help me.

00:47:52.845 --> 00:47:53.970 align:middle line:90%
>>PERRON: It's all it took.

00:47:53.970 --> 00:47:55.760 align:middle line:90%
But you had to mean it.

00:47:55.760 --> 00:47:57.580 align:middle line:10%
Because I'll tell
you, when Mrs. Warren

00:47:57.580 --> 00:48:00.400 align:middle line:10%
came to the house, when Ed
and Lorraine were there,

00:48:00.400 --> 00:48:01.960 align:middle line:10%
she was very specific.

00:48:01.960 --> 00:48:04.310 align:middle line:10%
He was very concerned
about our welfare.

00:48:04.310 --> 00:48:06.670 align:middle line:10%
He knew how vulnerable
young children were.

00:48:06.670 --> 00:48:08.920 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And they were
stealing-- these entities were

00:48:08.920 --> 00:48:09.920 align:middle line:90%
stealing your energy.

00:48:09.920 --> 00:48:12.542 align:middle line:84%
They were aging your
mother at a very rapid rate

00:48:12.542 --> 00:48:13.250 align:middle line:90%
>>PERRON: And us.

00:48:13.250 --> 00:48:14.249 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: And aging you.

00:48:14.249 --> 00:48:16.710 align:middle line:84%
I mean, they were having
physical impacts on your lives.

00:48:16.710 --> 00:48:17.010 align:middle line:90%
>>PERRON: Yes.

00:48:17.010 --> 00:48:17.240 align:middle line:90%
Yes, they were.

00:48:17.240 --> 00:48:18.390 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And you
were in danger.

00:48:18.390 --> 00:48:19.140 align:middle line:90%
>>PERRON: We were.

00:48:19.140 --> 00:48:21.130 align:middle line:84%
And I didn't think
of it that way,

00:48:21.130 --> 00:48:22.760 align:middle line:90%
because I was never attacked.

00:48:22.760 --> 00:48:24.734 align:middle line:84%
I was, like, the
appointed observer.

00:48:24.734 --> 00:48:25.400 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:48:25.400 --> 00:48:28.190 align:middle line:84%
>>PERRON: My fear and concern
was for my other family

00:48:28.190 --> 00:48:29.617 align:middle line:90%
members, but not for me.

00:48:29.617 --> 00:48:31.700 align:middle line:84%
I knew they were never
going to bother or hurt me.

00:48:31.700 --> 00:48:32.440 align:middle line:90%
I knew it.

00:48:32.440 --> 00:48:34.190 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So when
the Warrens came,

00:48:34.190 --> 00:48:35.500 align:middle line:90%
and they saw this situation--

00:48:35.500 --> 00:48:37.280 align:middle line:84%
>>PERRON: Mrs. Warren
said to all of us--

00:48:37.280 --> 00:48:38.750 align:middle line:90%
she gathered all of us together.

00:48:38.750 --> 00:48:40.870 align:middle line:90%
And she rarely spoke to us.

00:48:40.870 --> 00:48:44.480 align:middle line:84%
She really spent most of her
time talking to my mother.

00:48:44.480 --> 00:48:47.850 align:middle line:84%
And my father wanted nothing
to do with either one of them.

00:48:47.850 --> 00:48:50.550 align:middle line:84%
But she told us, gathered
us together in the kitchen.

00:48:50.550 --> 00:48:52.570 align:middle line:84%
And she said, girls
this is what you

00:48:52.570 --> 00:48:55.400 align:middle line:84%
need to do to protect
yourselves selves in this house.

00:48:55.400 --> 00:48:59.100 align:middle line:84%
What you say is, "In the
name of Jesus Christ,

00:48:59.100 --> 00:49:01.130 align:middle line:90%
go back to where you came from.

00:49:01.130 --> 00:49:02.600 align:middle line:90%
Leave us in peace."

00:49:02.600 --> 00:49:05.250 align:middle line:84%
And she made us say it
over and over again.

00:49:05.250 --> 00:49:08.100 align:middle line:84%
And then when things
would happen, we'd say it.

00:49:08.100 --> 00:49:10.990 align:middle line:84%
But it meant nothing,
because we didn't mean it.

00:49:10.990 --> 00:49:14.120 align:middle line:84%
We were just reciting
something that we'd memorized.

00:49:14.120 --> 00:49:16.800 align:middle line:84%
But when things got
to a point of crisis,

00:49:16.800 --> 00:49:19.590 align:middle line:84%
and you felt like
you had no choice,

00:49:19.590 --> 00:49:21.680 align:middle line:90%
I never had to resort to it.

00:49:21.680 --> 00:49:25.170 align:middle line:84%
It was nothing that
ever happened to me.

00:49:25.170 --> 00:49:28.080 align:middle line:84%
But when my mother or
Cindy, particularly,

00:49:28.080 --> 00:49:33.470 align:middle line:84%
were in absolute crisis, "God
help me" is what stopped it.

00:49:33.470 --> 00:49:37.750 align:middle line:84%
And it had to come
from the core, knowing,

00:49:37.750 --> 00:49:39.470 align:middle line:84%
believing that
there was something

00:49:39.470 --> 00:49:42.160 align:middle line:84%
more powerful than
what was happening,

00:49:42.160 --> 00:49:45.270 align:middle line:84%
that could circumvent
it, or stop it dead.

00:49:45.270 --> 00:49:47.190 align:middle line:90%
And it did every single time.

00:49:47.190 --> 00:49:48.690 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: I mean,
that's fascinating

00:49:48.690 --> 00:49:51.120 align:middle line:84%
when all the people watching
this-- there are times things

00:49:51.120 --> 00:49:54.879 align:middle line:84%
happen in life where
you're so helpless,

00:49:54.879 --> 00:49:56.170 align:middle line:90%
you don't know what else to do.

00:49:56.170 --> 00:49:59.330 align:middle line:84%
And how many times do people
yell out, "God help me"?

00:49:59.330 --> 00:50:01.070 align:middle line:84%
But you're saying
the help always came.

00:50:01.070 --> 00:50:01.570 align:middle line:90%
>>PERRON: Always.

00:50:01.570 --> 00:50:02.760 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: So it's always there.

00:50:02.760 --> 00:50:03.270 align:middle line:90%
>>PERRON: It's always there.

00:50:03.270 --> 00:50:04.840 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: The point is it's
always there for everyone.

00:50:04.840 --> 00:50:06.465 align:middle line:84%
You don't have to be
in this situation.

00:50:06.465 --> 00:50:08.697 align:middle line:84%
>>PERRON: My mom, too,
in the torches incident.

00:50:08.697 --> 00:50:09.280 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:50:09.280 --> 00:50:09.779 align:middle line:90%
My God.

00:50:09.779 --> 00:50:12.540 align:middle line:84%
>>PERRON: That was the one
that was really from my mom.

00:50:12.540 --> 00:50:15.330 align:middle line:84%
She has no recollection
of the seance at all.

00:50:15.330 --> 00:50:16.955 align:middle line:84%
So in terms-- I can
tell you that story

00:50:16.955 --> 00:50:19.329 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: I think we're going
to talk about that a little

00:50:19.329 --> 00:50:20.550 align:middle line:90%
bit later-- the seance story.

00:50:20.550 --> 00:50:21.799 align:middle line:90%
We're going to open with that.

00:50:21.799 --> 00:50:23.510 align:middle line:84%
But your mom kept
having fire issues

00:50:23.510 --> 00:50:25.510 align:middle line:90%
her slippers would catch fire.

00:50:25.510 --> 00:50:26.790 align:middle line:90%
She lost all her energy.

00:50:26.790 --> 00:50:28.030 align:middle line:90%
She was freezing.

00:50:28.030 --> 00:50:29.830 align:middle line:84%
>>PERRON: She collapsed
into the fire.

00:50:29.830 --> 00:50:31.320 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Collapsed
into the fire.

00:50:31.320 --> 00:50:32.190 align:middle line:90%
Fire was everywhere.

00:50:32.190 --> 00:50:34.000 align:middle line:84%
Your house caught
fire three times.

00:50:34.000 --> 00:50:35.810 align:middle line:84%
>>PERRON: Three times the
house caught fire, and should

00:50:35.810 --> 00:50:37.630 align:middle line:84%
have burned to the
ground all three times.

00:50:37.630 --> 00:50:39.190 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And your mom kept
catching fire, so to speak.

00:50:39.190 --> 00:50:40.860 align:middle line:84%
>>PERRON: And my mom
kept catching fire.

00:50:40.860 --> 00:50:43.840 align:middle line:84%
And then the night that
she woke up-- and remember,

00:50:43.840 --> 00:50:45.990 align:middle line:84%
the clock always
stopped at 5:15.

00:50:45.990 --> 00:50:50.410 align:middle line:84%
My father's wall banjo
clock stopped at 5:15 AM.

00:50:50.410 --> 00:50:53.140 align:middle line:84%
And that's when the
manifestations would occur.

00:50:53.140 --> 00:50:54.010 align:middle line:90%
I don't know why.

00:50:54.010 --> 00:50:55.780 align:middle line:84%
I wish I could
answer that for you.

00:50:55.780 --> 00:50:57.070 align:middle line:90%
But that was the time.

00:50:57.070 --> 00:50:59.670 align:middle line:90%
5:15 AM is when it stopped.

00:50:59.670 --> 00:51:01.830 align:middle line:84%
That's also the time
that her brother died,

00:51:01.830 --> 00:51:03.560 align:middle line:90%
and her sister died.

00:51:03.560 --> 00:51:05.635 align:middle line:84%
My mother's family
that has passed.

00:51:05.635 --> 00:51:09.240 align:middle line:90%


00:51:09.240 --> 00:51:11.970 align:middle line:84%
It's a very poignant
and powerful message,

00:51:11.970 --> 00:51:14.190 align:middle line:90%
but we don't know what it is.

00:51:14.190 --> 00:51:18.160 align:middle line:84%
But what happened was
my mother woke up.

00:51:18.160 --> 00:51:20.610 align:middle line:84%
My father was
sleeping beside her.

00:51:20.610 --> 00:51:22.312 align:middle line:90%
He was again--

00:51:22.312 --> 00:51:23.520 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Dead to the world--

00:51:23.520 --> 00:51:25.920 align:middle line:84%
>>PERRON: --not among
the living, apparently.

00:51:25.920 --> 00:51:28.720 align:middle line:84%
And every spirit
in the house was

00:51:28.720 --> 00:51:31.390 align:middle line:90%
gathered in my mother's room.

00:51:31.390 --> 00:51:33.350 align:middle line:84%
Many of them that
she recognized,

00:51:33.350 --> 00:51:35.080 align:middle line:90%
and others that she did not.

00:51:35.080 --> 00:51:36.850 align:middle line:90%
The room was full.

00:51:36.850 --> 00:51:39.570 align:middle line:84%
They were all around
the bottom of her bed.

00:51:39.570 --> 00:51:43.020 align:middle line:84%
And they had torches--
wooden torches.

00:51:43.020 --> 00:51:45.490 align:middle line:84%
And there was fire
on the top of them,

00:51:45.490 --> 00:51:48.800 align:middle line:84%
like you would see going after
Vlad the Impaler, or something.

00:51:48.800 --> 00:51:50.090 align:middle line:90%
I mean, bizarre.

00:51:50.090 --> 00:51:52.740 align:middle line:84%
And they're banging them,
banging them on the floor.

00:51:52.740 --> 00:51:55.160 align:middle line:90%
The whole house is vibrating.

00:51:55.160 --> 00:51:58.040 align:middle line:84%
And they're doing it in
syncopation, over and over

00:51:58.040 --> 00:52:01.700 align:middle line:84%
and over again, in
rhythm, staccato rhythm.

00:52:01.700 --> 00:52:05.530 align:middle line:84%
And then this one entity again
comes out from the crowd.

00:52:05.530 --> 00:52:08.290 align:middle line:84%
And she walks around,
and she leans down

00:52:08.290 --> 00:52:10.767 align:middle line:84%
as if she's going
to kiss my father.

00:52:10.767 --> 00:52:12.850 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: This was the
same Mrs. Arnold, we think.

00:52:12.850 --> 00:52:14.970 align:middle line:84%
The one with the broken
neck and the cobwebby face.

00:52:14.970 --> 00:52:16.350 align:middle line:84%
>>PERRON: And we'll
never know, really.

00:52:16.350 --> 00:52:17.058 align:middle line:90%
We'll never know.

00:52:17.058 --> 00:52:19.390 align:middle line:90%
But most likely her.

00:52:19.390 --> 00:52:21.800 align:middle line:84%
And then she came around to
the other side of the bed,

00:52:21.800 --> 00:52:24.010 align:middle line:84%
and started coming
toward my mother.

00:52:24.010 --> 00:52:26.849 align:middle line:84%
And that's when she started
with the incantation.

00:52:26.849 --> 00:52:28.640 align:middle line:84%
And my mother remembers
looking-- oh, there

00:52:28.640 --> 00:52:30.348 align:middle line:84%
were children in the
room and everything.

00:52:30.348 --> 00:52:31.660 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Show the incantation.

00:52:31.660 --> 00:52:33.800 align:middle line:90%
>>PERRON: Well, I don't--

00:52:33.800 --> 00:52:35.550 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: It was
something about, I will--

00:52:35.550 --> 00:52:38.590 align:middle line:84%
>>PERRON: It started with,
"'Twas mistress once afore ye

00:52:38.590 --> 00:52:41.070 align:middle line:84%
came, and mistress
here will be anon.

00:52:41.070 --> 00:52:43.560 align:middle line:84%
Will drive ye out
with fiery broom,

00:52:43.560 --> 00:52:46.090 align:middle line:84%
will drive ye mad
with death and gloom."

00:52:46.090 --> 00:52:48.232 align:middle line:90%
It went on, and on, and on.

00:52:48.232 --> 00:52:49.190 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: I got chills.

00:52:49.190 --> 00:52:50.100 align:middle line:90%
These were all death threats.

00:52:50.100 --> 00:52:50.900 align:middle line:84%
>>PERRON: And I don't
have it memorized,

00:52:50.900 --> 00:52:52.790 align:middle line:84%
because I don't want
to memorize it--

00:52:52.790 --> 00:52:53.650 align:middle line:90%
if that that makes any sense.

00:52:53.650 --> 00:52:54.010 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: It's enough.

00:52:54.010 --> 00:52:54.210 align:middle line:90%
That gives people an idea.

00:52:54.210 --> 00:52:56.084 align:middle line:84%
>>PERRON: But it came
out through-- my mother

00:52:56.084 --> 00:52:58.280 align:middle line:84%
wrote it down after
the incident was over.

00:52:58.280 --> 00:53:00.260 align:middle line:84%
And then she was
hypnotized later,

00:53:00.260 --> 00:53:01.760 align:middle line:90%
and we got the whole thing.

00:53:01.760 --> 00:53:03.640 align:middle line:84%
She won't ever be
hypnotized again.

00:53:03.640 --> 00:53:06.145 align:middle line:90%
That was very traumatic.

00:53:06.145 --> 00:53:08.020 align:middle line:84%
You know, if people
don't want to believe it,

00:53:08.020 --> 00:53:09.090 align:middle line:90%
they don't have to.

00:53:09.090 --> 00:53:09.270 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:53:09.270 --> 00:53:10.450 align:middle line:84%
>>PERRON: She's got
nothing to prove.

00:53:10.450 --> 00:53:12.780 align:middle line:84%
Bless her heart, she's been
to Hell and back already.

00:53:12.780 --> 00:53:17.410 align:middle line:84%
She just turned 75, and we're
all about celebrating the light

00:53:17.410 --> 00:53:20.150 align:middle line:84%
and walking away from
the darkness now.

00:53:20.150 --> 00:53:22.330 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: When she had
problems during all of this--

00:53:22.330 --> 00:53:23.410 align:middle line:84%
and we're going
to be wrapping up

00:53:23.410 --> 00:53:25.368 align:middle line:84%
this part of our conversation
in a little bit--

00:53:25.368 --> 00:53:27.560 align:middle line:84%
but your mother's identity
started slipping away.

00:53:27.560 --> 00:53:28.268 align:middle line:90%
>>PERRON: It did.

00:53:28.268 --> 00:53:31.640 align:middle line:84%
She began dressing
in vintage clothing.

00:53:31.640 --> 00:53:37.100 align:middle line:84%
She was what I think Mr.
and Mrs. Warren accurately

00:53:37.100 --> 00:53:39.260 align:middle line:90%
described as oppression.

00:53:39.260 --> 00:53:41.870 align:middle line:84%
There was a spirit that
perceived herself--

00:53:41.870 --> 00:53:43.550 align:middle line:90%
it was not Bathsheba.

00:53:43.550 --> 00:53:47.740 align:middle line:84%
That language was already
archaic in the 1800s.

00:53:47.740 --> 00:53:49.770 align:middle line:90%
That was 1700s language.

00:53:49.770 --> 00:53:52.970 align:middle line:84%
Bathsheba lived
between 1812 and 1885,

00:53:52.970 --> 00:53:55.150 align:middle line:84%
and died a very old,
miserable woman.

00:53:55.150 --> 00:53:57.670 align:middle line:84%
I'm not saying she was
a very pleasant spirit,

00:53:57.670 --> 00:54:01.020 align:middle line:84%
but she was not the one that
was tormenting my mother.

00:54:01.020 --> 00:54:03.880 align:middle line:84%
The one that was,
whoever she was,

00:54:03.880 --> 00:54:06.660 align:middle line:84%
perceived herself to be
mistress of the house.

00:54:06.660 --> 00:54:09.234 align:middle line:84%
And she wanted my
mother out of there.

00:54:09.234 --> 00:54:09.900 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:54:09.900 --> 00:54:12.910 align:middle line:84%
>>PERRON: And she wanted--
coveted us, the children,

00:54:12.910 --> 00:54:15.710 align:middle line:84%
and had an overt
attraction to my father.

00:54:15.710 --> 00:54:16.570 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:54:16.570 --> 00:54:18.320 align:middle line:84%
>>PERRON: And
interestingly, he befriended

00:54:18.320 --> 00:54:19.870 align:middle line:90%
the one that hated my mother.

00:54:19.870 --> 00:54:21.890 align:middle line:84%
The psychologists have
a great time with that.

00:54:21.890 --> 00:54:23.140 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah, I bet they do.

00:54:23.140 --> 00:54:25.770 align:middle line:84%
>>PERRON: And my
perception of it

00:54:25.770 --> 00:54:28.070 align:middle line:84%
is that she couldn't get
rid of my mother the way

00:54:28.070 --> 00:54:31.900 align:middle line:84%
she wanted to leave
her, so instead

00:54:31.900 --> 00:54:33.930 align:middle line:84%
began to try to claim
her from within.

00:54:33.930 --> 00:54:34.640 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:54:34.640 --> 00:54:37.980 align:middle line:84%
And my mother is a
very strong woman.

00:54:37.980 --> 00:54:43.230 align:middle line:84%
So she was a very powerful
entity and, to this day,

00:54:43.230 --> 00:54:43.752 align:middle line:90%
still is.

00:54:43.752 --> 00:54:44.960 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: She's still around?

00:54:44.960 --> 00:54:45.816 align:middle line:90%
>>PERRON: Oh, yeah.

00:54:45.816 --> 00:54:47.690 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Is she still
bothering your mother?

00:54:47.690 --> 00:54:48.320 align:middle line:90%
>>PERRON: No.

00:54:48.320 --> 00:54:48.920 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: No.

00:54:48.920 --> 00:54:49.310 align:middle line:90%
>>PERRON: No.

00:54:49.310 --> 00:54:51.643 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Where is she, when
you say she's still around?

00:54:51.643 --> 00:54:52.810 align:middle line:90%
Who is she still around?

00:54:52.810 --> 00:54:53.750 align:middle line:90%
>>PERRON: Me.

00:54:53.750 --> 00:54:54.530 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Mm.

00:54:54.530 --> 00:54:57.540 align:middle line:84%
And Bathsheba, too, follows
me around like a puppy dog.

00:54:57.540 --> 00:54:59.670 align:middle line:84%
I can't tell you
how many photographs

00:54:59.670 --> 00:55:02.641 align:middle line:84%
have been taken of me with
a woman, an older woman--

00:55:02.641 --> 00:55:04.140 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: But they
don't bother you.

00:55:04.140 --> 00:55:05.681 align:middle line:84%
>>PERRON: --standing
right behind me.

00:55:05.681 --> 00:55:06.390 align:middle line:90%
No, they love me.

00:55:06.390 --> 00:55:07.722 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: They don't bother you.

00:55:07.722 --> 00:55:08.490 align:middle line:90%
And the thing is--

00:55:08.490 --> 00:55:09.495 align:middle line:90%
>>PERRON: I told their story.

00:55:09.495 --> 00:55:10.453 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes, you did.

00:55:10.453 --> 00:55:12.650 align:middle line:84%
And your mother
had a dear friend

00:55:12.650 --> 00:55:14.250 align:middle line:90%
named Fran, who was a light.

00:55:14.250 --> 00:55:15.660 align:middle line:90%
She was a light.

00:55:15.660 --> 00:55:17.962 align:middle line:84%
And these entities would
tend to follow people home.

00:55:17.962 --> 00:55:19.670 align:middle line:84%
I mean, they'd go in
their car with them.

00:55:19.670 --> 00:55:21.520 align:middle line:84%
And if they'd been
visiting your house--

00:55:21.520 --> 00:55:23.180 align:middle line:90%
>>PERRON: Kathy, Jerry, Fran--

00:55:23.180 --> 00:55:26.490 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: But no one ever
really bothered Fran.

00:55:26.490 --> 00:55:27.419 align:middle line:90%
They wouldn't dare.

00:55:27.419 --> 00:55:27.960 align:middle line:90%
>>PERRON: No.

00:55:27.960 --> 00:55:30.450 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And you said it
was because-- in the book,

00:55:30.450 --> 00:55:34.412 align:middle line:84%
it was said it was because
she was so pure of spirit.

00:55:34.412 --> 00:55:35.620 align:middle line:90%
Nothing could penetrate that.

00:55:35.620 --> 00:55:37.090 align:middle line:84%
>>PERRON: Nothing
could permeate it.

00:55:37.090 --> 00:55:37.230 align:middle line:90%
Nothing.

00:55:37.230 --> 00:55:38.440 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: There was no fear.

00:55:38.440 --> 00:55:39.280 align:middle line:90%
>>PERRON: No.

00:55:39.280 --> 00:55:41.850 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: So is fear the bridge?

00:55:41.850 --> 00:55:44.280 align:middle line:90%
>>PERRON: I think fear is fuel.

00:55:44.280 --> 00:55:47.360 align:middle line:90%
Fear and anger is fuel for them.

00:55:47.360 --> 00:55:52.300 align:middle line:84%
There's an old Indian saying,
"Burn your fear as fuel."

00:55:52.300 --> 00:55:53.780 align:middle line:84%
And it's in one
of the books-- one

00:55:53.780 --> 00:55:56.630 align:middle line:90%
of the quotations in the books.

00:55:56.630 --> 00:56:01.020 align:middle line:84%
I think fear is the
most destructive emotion

00:56:01.020 --> 00:56:01.710 align:middle line:90%
that we have.

00:56:01.710 --> 00:56:05.370 align:middle line:84%
It serves its purpose
well when we couple it

00:56:05.370 --> 00:56:07.810 align:middle line:84%
with instinct and
intuition, and something

00:56:07.810 --> 00:56:11.640 align:middle line:84%
tells us don't go down that
alley, don't get in that car.

00:56:11.640 --> 00:56:13.440 align:middle line:90%
Don't do this, don't do that.

00:56:13.440 --> 00:56:17.110 align:middle line:84%
But when we relinquish
our own will to it,

00:56:17.110 --> 00:56:22.200 align:middle line:84%
when it dictates what we do
not or do experience in life,

00:56:22.200 --> 00:56:24.090 align:middle line:90%
then it's destructive.

00:56:24.090 --> 00:56:26.450 align:middle line:84%
And from the way
that I processed,

00:56:26.450 --> 00:56:31.280 align:middle line:84%
as a precocious 12-year-old
when I saw my first apparition,

00:56:31.280 --> 00:56:35.670 align:middle line:84%
was there is something,
there is something else.

00:56:35.670 --> 00:56:37.560 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So to you it
was a world of wonder.

00:56:37.560 --> 00:56:38.460 align:middle line:90%
And--

00:56:38.460 --> 00:56:39.542 align:middle line:90%
>>PERRON: It was hopeful.

00:56:39.542 --> 00:56:40.750 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: And it was hopeful.

00:56:40.750 --> 00:56:43.030 align:middle line:90%
But not to your mother.

00:56:43.030 --> 00:56:45.740 align:middle line:84%
>>PERRON: I never wanted to
think that it was just ashes

00:56:45.740 --> 00:56:46.740 align:middle line:90%
to ashes, dust to dust--

00:56:46.740 --> 00:56:47.365 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Sure.

00:56:47.365 --> 00:56:49.670 align:middle line:84%
>>PERRON: --and that
everything that we accumulate

00:56:49.670 --> 00:56:53.520 align:middle line:84%
in life in terms of our sharing
of emotions with other people

00:56:53.520 --> 00:56:56.630 align:middle line:84%
and animals-- the love, the
tenderness that we share,

00:56:56.630 --> 00:56:58.800 align:middle line:84%
and how we embrace each
other in this life.

00:56:58.800 --> 00:57:02.250 align:middle line:84%
And all that we take in-- every
book we read, every movie we

00:57:02.250 --> 00:57:07.050 align:middle line:84%
see, everything that
we feed into this mind.

00:57:07.050 --> 00:57:09.820 align:middle line:84%
Not the brain, but the mind--
separate and distinct entities.

00:57:09.820 --> 00:57:10.780 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:57:10.780 --> 00:57:12.725 align:middle line:84%
>>PERRON: --is
lost at our death.

00:57:12.725 --> 00:57:13.350 align:middle line:90%
It's just gone.

00:57:13.350 --> 00:57:13.760 align:middle line:90%
And it's not.

00:57:13.760 --> 00:57:15.470 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So for you
this was positive.

00:57:15.470 --> 00:57:16.260 align:middle line:90%
It was hopeful.

00:57:16.260 --> 00:57:16.670 align:middle line:90%
>>PERRON: It was.

00:57:16.670 --> 00:57:18.160 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: For your
mother it was,

00:57:18.160 --> 00:57:20.530 align:middle line:84%
what is going to
happen to my family?

00:57:20.530 --> 00:57:22.220 align:middle line:90%
She let fear rule her life--

00:57:22.220 --> 00:57:23.580 align:middle line:90%
>>PERRON: She did.

00:57:23.580 --> 00:57:23.990 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: --and it
created a bridge.

00:57:23.990 --> 00:57:25.240 align:middle line:90%
>>PERRON: She got the door in.

00:57:25.240 --> 00:57:26.480 align:middle line:90%
That was the door in.

00:57:26.480 --> 00:57:29.505 align:middle line:84%
And I'll tell you-- and
I'll do this quickly.

00:57:29.505 --> 00:57:30.880 align:middle line:84%
I know we're
running out of time.

00:57:30.880 --> 00:57:33.140 align:middle line:84%
But I will tell you where
her point of epiphany

00:57:33.140 --> 00:57:37.150 align:middle line:84%
came-- was the night that
she got up at 11:00 at night.

00:57:37.150 --> 00:57:38.370 align:middle line:90%
I was doing my homework.

00:57:38.370 --> 00:57:40.730 align:middle line:84%
She got up, and she
said, I'm hungry.

00:57:40.730 --> 00:57:44.220 align:middle line:84%
It was, like, oh, yeah-- but
she actually wants to eat!

00:57:44.220 --> 00:57:47.620 align:middle line:84%
And so I walked from the parlor,
through the completely closed,

00:57:47.620 --> 00:57:50.540 align:middle line:84%
shut down dining
room, into the front--

00:57:50.540 --> 00:57:52.374 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Dogs wouldn't
enter certain rooms.

00:57:52.374 --> 00:57:52.998 align:middle line:90%
>>PERRON: Yeah.

00:57:52.998 --> 00:57:55.740 align:middle line:84%
They wouldn't even go near the
cellar door-- into the kitchen,

00:57:55.740 --> 00:57:57.040 align:middle line:90%
into the pantry.

00:57:57.040 --> 00:58:00.090 align:middle line:84%
And of course, before the days
of microwaves or anything else,

00:58:00.090 --> 00:58:02.880 align:middle line:84%
I had to warm up the beef stew
that I had made for the girls.

00:58:02.880 --> 00:58:04.080 align:middle line:84%
I'd become the third
parent at that point.

00:58:04.080 --> 00:58:04.780 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:58:04.780 --> 00:58:06.810 align:middle line:90%
Your mother was dysfunctional.

00:58:06.810 --> 00:58:07.610 align:middle line:90%
>>PERRON: Mm hm.

00:58:07.610 --> 00:58:09.204 align:middle line:84%
And I said, give
me a few minutes.

00:58:09.204 --> 00:58:10.870 align:middle line:84%
The last thing she
said to me is, honey,

00:58:10.870 --> 00:58:12.000 align:middle line:90%
make me pot of coffee.

00:58:12.000 --> 00:58:14.290 align:middle line:84%
I'm like, Mom, it's
11:00 at night.

00:58:14.290 --> 00:58:17.210 align:middle line:84%
She said, it's the
nectar of the gods.

00:58:17.210 --> 00:58:19.870 align:middle line:84%
I said, well, OK-- I'll
make you some coffee.

00:58:19.870 --> 00:58:21.600 align:middle line:90%
I'll warm up the beef stew.

00:58:21.600 --> 00:58:25.230 align:middle line:84%
In my absence while I was at
least 100 feet away from her

00:58:25.230 --> 00:58:27.900 align:middle line:84%
in the house she reached
over into the wood box,

00:58:27.900 --> 00:58:29.610 align:middle line:84%
she pulled a log
out, she threw it

00:58:29.610 --> 00:58:32.180 align:middle line:84%
into the fire-- last
log of the night-- put

00:58:32.180 --> 00:58:33.390 align:middle line:90%
the screen up in front of it.

00:58:33.390 --> 00:58:36.930 align:middle line:84%
She heard a sound
behind her-- laughter.

00:58:36.930 --> 00:58:39.840 align:middle line:84%
And she turned around,
and the dining room

00:58:39.840 --> 00:58:44.180 align:middle line:84%
was completely lighted
with lamplight, oil lamps,

00:58:44.180 --> 00:58:45.290 align:middle line:90%
and candles.

00:58:45.290 --> 00:58:47.600 align:middle line:84%
There were two men
sitting at a table that

00:58:47.600 --> 00:58:52.410 align:middle line:84%
was not our own-- hand-hewn oak
table, benches on both sides.

00:58:52.410 --> 00:58:55.910 align:middle line:84%
The woman was standing, cooking
in front of the fireplace--

00:58:55.910 --> 00:58:58.530 align:middle line:84%
a fireplace that had been
closed well more than a century,

00:58:58.530 --> 00:59:00.010 align:middle line:90%
sealed solid shut.

00:59:00.010 --> 00:59:02.500 align:middle line:84%
There were two little kids
running around-- two or three,

00:59:02.500 --> 00:59:04.270 align:middle line:84%
running around, and
Mom saying, go, sit,

00:59:04.270 --> 00:59:06.660 align:middle line:90%
take your seats at the table.

00:59:06.660 --> 00:59:09.375 align:middle line:84%
Now this was-- they
had pewter steins.

00:59:09.375 --> 00:59:12.100 align:middle line:84%
And pewter steins weren't
even used in the 1800s.

00:59:12.100 --> 00:59:14.520 align:middle line:84%
They realized they were
dangerous, because of the lead.

00:59:14.520 --> 00:59:15.103 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:59:15.103 --> 00:59:17.390 align:middle line:84%
>>PERRON: So it had to
have been in the 1700s.

00:59:17.390 --> 00:59:21.780 align:middle line:84%
She looked at this family having
dinner together in our dining

00:59:21.780 --> 00:59:27.380 align:middle line:84%
room from 200 years before
and she just stared at them.

00:59:27.380 --> 00:59:29.870 align:middle line:84%
And one of the men
turned his head,

00:59:29.870 --> 00:59:31.670 align:middle line:90%
and he looked into the parlor.

00:59:31.670 --> 00:59:33.820 align:middle line:84%
And he made eye
contact with my mother,

00:59:33.820 --> 00:59:36.900 align:middle line:84%
and nudged the man beside
him, and pointed her out

00:59:36.900 --> 00:59:38.040 align:middle line:90%
to his companion.

00:59:38.040 --> 00:59:40.310 align:middle line:10%
And my mother was the ghost.

00:59:40.310 --> 00:59:43.650 align:middle line:10%
And that's when she
realized that she lived

00:59:43.650 --> 00:59:47.060 align:middle line:10%
in a portal cleverly
disguised as a farmhouse

00:59:47.060 --> 00:59:51.550 align:middle line:10%
and that not only was there
a way to look into the past,

00:59:51.550 --> 00:59:54.880 align:middle line:10%
there was also a way for
them to look into the future.

00:59:54.880 --> 00:59:57.590 align:middle line:84%
And that we were living
in multiple dimensions

00:59:57.590 --> 00:59:58.590 align:middle line:90%
simultaneously--

00:59:58.590 --> 00:59:59.590 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: I have chills.

00:59:59.590 --> 01:00:02.015 align:middle line:84%
>>PERRON: --and that's
when she came back.

01:00:02.015 --> 01:00:02.890 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Oh, my God.

01:00:02.890 --> 01:00:04.891 align:middle line:90%
What-- OK.

01:00:04.891 --> 01:00:05.390 align:middle line:90%
All right.

01:00:05.390 --> 01:00:08.160 align:middle line:90%
We are out of time.

01:00:08.160 --> 01:00:13.179 align:middle line:84%
There are hardly words here,
but what an incredible thing

01:00:13.179 --> 01:00:14.220 align:middle line:90%
your family went through.

01:00:14.220 --> 01:00:15.970 align:middle line:84%
We're going to
continue this story.

01:00:15.970 --> 01:00:19.810 align:middle line:84%
And you're such an amazingly
phenomenal person that

01:00:19.810 --> 01:00:21.967 align:middle line:90%
was chosen to share this story.

01:00:21.967 --> 01:00:22.800 align:middle line:90%
>>PERRON: Thank you.

01:00:22.800 --> 01:00:24.740 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Thank you
so much, Andrea.

01:00:24.740 --> 01:00:26.400 align:middle line:10%
We will continue
this conversation

01:00:26.400 --> 01:00:29.210 align:middle line:10%
in our next interview on the
topic of the deeper impacts

01:00:29.210 --> 01:00:30.940 align:middle line:10%
of inter-dimensional contact.

01:00:30.940 --> 01:00:32.530 align:middle line:84%
You can find
Andrea's book titled

01:00:32.530 --> 01:00:35.030 align:middle line:84%
"House of Darkness,
House of Light,"

01:00:35.030 --> 01:00:36.430 align:middle line:90%
through major booksellers.

01:00:36.430 --> 01:00:40.500 align:middle line:84%
Until next time, thank you for
joining us here on Gaiam TV.
