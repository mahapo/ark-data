00:00:20.403 --> 00:00:22.570 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA MEREDITH: Here's
an intriguing one for you.

00:00:22.570 --> 00:00:24.640 align:middle line:10%
"Course in Miracles"
lecturer Gary Renard

00:00:24.640 --> 00:00:27.880 align:middle line:10%
has found a new take on
the concurrent lifetimes

00:00:27.880 --> 00:00:30.940 align:middle line:10%
between Jesus and Buddha,
both known by other names

00:00:30.940 --> 00:00:32.110 align:middle line:10%
historically.

00:00:32.110 --> 00:00:34.840 align:middle line:84%
It started when his
guides, Arten and Pursah,

00:00:34.840 --> 00:00:36.820 align:middle line:84%
came to him with
a story chronicled

00:00:36.820 --> 00:00:38.380 align:middle line:84%
in his new book
called "Lifetimes

00:00:38.380 --> 00:00:39.540 align:middle line:90%
When Jesus Knew Buddha."

00:00:39.540 --> 00:00:41.440 align:middle line:84%
First of all, I mean
this is really--

00:00:41.440 --> 00:00:46.090 align:middle line:84%
it's a fascinating story
because there's almost to me

00:00:46.090 --> 00:00:52.150 align:middle line:84%
a fantastical, magical, and even
quirky element of this story

00:00:52.150 --> 00:00:56.110 align:middle line:84%
to look at these two powerful
avatars, master beings,

00:00:56.110 --> 00:00:58.570 align:middle line:84%
having been together and
spent lifetimes together

00:00:58.570 --> 00:01:01.490 align:middle line:84%
and how they may have learned
alongside one another.

00:01:01.490 --> 00:01:03.140 align:middle line:84%
And so that's what
you're doing here.

00:01:03.140 --> 00:01:06.370 align:middle line:84%
But this was given to you
through Arten and Pursah,

00:01:06.370 --> 00:01:09.790 align:middle line:84%
two of your guides that appear
and disappear in odd ways.

00:01:09.790 --> 00:01:14.080 align:middle line:84%
So what I'd love to have you do
is tell us about these guides,

00:01:14.080 --> 00:01:16.810 align:middle line:84%
where you first came
in contact with them,

00:01:16.810 --> 00:01:19.630 align:middle line:84%
and what they've provided
you with throughout the time

00:01:19.630 --> 00:01:20.648 align:middle line:90%
together.

00:01:20.648 --> 00:01:22.690 align:middle line:10%
>>GARY R. RENARD: Well,
it's an interesting story

00:01:22.690 --> 00:01:25.630 align:middle line:10%
because I had been
on a spiritual path

00:01:25.630 --> 00:01:28.790 align:middle line:10%
for about 15 years or so.

00:01:28.790 --> 00:01:31.440 align:middle line:10%
But I still felt like
something was missing,

00:01:31.440 --> 00:01:34.000 align:middle line:10%
and I couldn't
really articulate it.

00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:36.620 align:middle line:84%
And then one day,
I was meditating.

00:01:36.620 --> 00:01:39.340 align:middle line:84%
I'd moved to Maine from
Massachusetts at that time.

00:01:39.340 --> 00:01:42.010 align:middle line:90%
This was about late 1992.

00:01:42.010 --> 00:01:45.550 align:middle line:84%
And all of a sudden, when I
came out of my meditation,

00:01:45.550 --> 00:01:49.930 align:middle line:84%
there were two people sitting
there on my living room couch.

00:01:49.930 --> 00:01:51.460 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: [CHUCKLES]

00:01:51.460 --> 00:01:56.680 align:middle line:84%
>>RENARD: And I should have
probably been a little bit

00:01:56.680 --> 00:02:00.130 align:middle line:84%
terrified, but I wasn't because
they just looked so peaceful.

00:02:00.130 --> 00:02:01.547 align:middle line:84%
They looked so
happy and peaceful.

00:02:01.547 --> 00:02:02.963 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: What did
they look like?

00:02:02.963 --> 00:02:05.830 align:middle line:84%
Give us an idea, so we can--
for those of us who are visual.

00:02:05.830 --> 00:02:08.590 align:middle line:84%
>>RENARD: Well, the
woman looked like

00:02:08.590 --> 00:02:13.700 align:middle line:84%
this beautiful, exquisite
kind of from India

00:02:13.700 --> 00:02:19.070 align:middle line:90%
looking woman and some guy.

00:02:19.070 --> 00:02:22.700 align:middle line:84%
I didn't care much about
him, but she was beautiful.

00:02:22.700 --> 00:02:24.320 align:middle line:90%
And he looked really good.

00:02:24.320 --> 00:02:29.090 align:middle line:84%
I mean, they looked unusually
healthy and beautiful.

00:02:29.090 --> 00:02:32.960 align:middle line:84%
And I think that the reason
that they appeared that way

00:02:32.960 --> 00:02:36.020 align:middle line:84%
was just to comfort me because
they were going to teach me

00:02:36.020 --> 00:02:39.140 align:middle line:84%
a lot of things,
and they were really

00:02:39.140 --> 00:02:42.650 align:middle line:84%
the Holy Spirit manifesting
as Arten and Pursah.

00:02:42.650 --> 00:02:49.460 align:middle line:84%
And I just was
overwhelmed at first,

00:02:49.460 --> 00:02:52.498 align:middle line:84%
but then I started
to relax and listen

00:02:52.498 --> 00:02:53.540 align:middle line:90%
to what they were saying.

00:02:53.540 --> 00:02:55.165 align:middle line:84%
And what they were
saying was something

00:02:55.165 --> 00:02:58.070 align:middle line:84%
that was quite different
than what I had heard

00:02:58.070 --> 00:03:00.510 align:middle line:90%
before on my spiritual path.

00:03:00.510 --> 00:03:02.750 align:middle line:84%
So what they were
presenting was something

00:03:02.750 --> 00:03:07.760 align:middle line:84%
that I would describe
as pure non duality.

00:03:07.760 --> 00:03:09.380 align:middle line:84%
They were saying
that what you believe

00:03:09.380 --> 00:03:12.820 align:middle line:84%
is not true, that
none of this is true,

00:03:12.820 --> 00:03:15.860 align:middle line:90%
that the whole thing is untrue.

00:03:15.860 --> 00:03:19.310 align:middle line:84%
And I know the word hoax
is popular nowadays,

00:03:19.310 --> 00:03:24.850 align:middle line:84%
but that word is being used to
describe part of the illusion.

00:03:24.850 --> 00:03:26.390 align:middle line:84%
And what they are
saying is no, you

00:03:26.390 --> 00:03:29.540 align:middle line:84%
don't understand-- the
whole thing is a hoax.

00:03:29.540 --> 00:03:34.220 align:middle line:84%
None of this is true, and
the only reality is God.

00:03:34.220 --> 00:03:37.340 align:middle line:84%
And they were leading
me toward this thing

00:03:37.340 --> 00:03:38.930 align:middle line:90%
called "A Course in Miracles."

00:03:38.930 --> 00:03:45.260 align:middle line:84%
But they also were telling
me, look, this is the truth,

00:03:45.260 --> 00:03:47.660 align:middle line:84%
that great masters
like Jesus and Buddha

00:03:47.660 --> 00:03:49.840 align:middle line:90%
eventually discovered.

00:03:49.840 --> 00:03:53.350 align:middle line:84%
They were saying that
there is only one reality,

00:03:53.350 --> 00:03:57.490 align:middle line:84%
and that reality is a constant,
and it doesn't change.

00:03:57.490 --> 00:04:00.280 align:middle line:84%
This is a world of
shift in change,

00:04:00.280 --> 00:04:03.130 align:middle line:84%
but reality does not
shift and change.

00:04:03.130 --> 00:04:05.120 align:middle line:90%
It's always the same.

00:04:05.120 --> 00:04:07.460 align:middle line:84%
And I had never
heard that before.

00:04:07.460 --> 00:04:10.270 align:middle line:84%
So it was like, OK,
this is interesting.

00:04:10.270 --> 00:04:12.220 align:middle line:90%
So tell me more.

00:04:12.220 --> 00:04:18.430 align:middle line:84%
And what they did was they
went on for about nine years

00:04:18.430 --> 00:04:22.250 align:middle line:84%
and engaged me in 17
different conversations

00:04:22.250 --> 00:04:24.690 align:middle line:90%
that make up my first book.

00:04:24.690 --> 00:04:27.980 align:middle line:84%
But all through my
first three books,

00:04:27.980 --> 00:04:30.950 align:middle line:84%
they would always talk
about Jesus and Buddha

00:04:30.950 --> 00:04:32.870 align:middle line:90%
and what they were like.

00:04:32.870 --> 00:04:35.360 align:middle line:84%
And after the third
book, I thought, well,

00:04:35.360 --> 00:04:36.650 align:middle line:90%
maybe that's it--

00:04:36.650 --> 00:04:38.570 align:middle line:90%
maybe it's over.

00:04:38.570 --> 00:04:42.680 align:middle line:84%
And every now and then,
after I talked to them,

00:04:42.680 --> 00:04:46.500 align:middle line:84%
I would think, wow, I
should have asked them this,

00:04:46.500 --> 00:04:48.340 align:middle line:84%
or I should have
asked them that.

00:04:48.340 --> 00:04:50.820 align:middle line:84%
It's like I forgot
to ask them this.

00:04:50.820 --> 00:04:53.160 align:middle line:84%
And after the third
book, I thought

00:04:53.160 --> 00:04:56.680 align:middle line:84%
it was over because I
thought it was a trilogy.

00:04:56.680 --> 00:05:01.950 align:middle line:84%
And then I asked them, well,
how did Jesus get to be Jesus?

00:05:01.950 --> 00:05:04.500 align:middle line:90%
How did Buddha get to be Buddha?

00:05:04.500 --> 00:05:07.050 align:middle line:84%
What were they like
in those incarnations

00:05:07.050 --> 00:05:11.070 align:middle line:84%
just before they became
Jesus and Buddha?

00:05:11.070 --> 00:05:14.130 align:middle line:84%
And the answer to that
question turned out

00:05:14.130 --> 00:05:16.810 align:middle line:90%
to be more than I bargained for.

00:05:16.810 --> 00:05:17.610 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:05:17.610 --> 00:05:19.600 align:middle line:84%
>>RENARD: It turned out
to be whole other books.

00:05:19.600 --> 00:05:20.400 align:middle line:90%
[CHUCKLING]

00:05:20.400 --> 00:05:22.570 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Right, and
that's where we are now.

00:05:22.570 --> 00:05:25.290 align:middle line:84%
OK, let's go back for a moment
when they're telling you that

00:05:25.290 --> 00:05:29.010 align:middle line:84%
all of this-- everything
we know in our waking times

00:05:29.010 --> 00:05:30.420 align:middle line:90%
as reality--

00:05:30.420 --> 00:05:33.120 align:middle line:90%
is a hoax or an illusion.

00:05:33.120 --> 00:05:35.190 align:middle line:90%
Was it Einstein?

00:05:35.190 --> 00:05:36.330 align:middle line:90%
Someone can correct me.

00:05:36.330 --> 00:05:37.497 align:middle line:90%
Someone out there will know.

00:05:37.497 --> 00:05:40.530 align:middle line:84%
It could be nine stone that
said reality is an illusion,

00:05:40.530 --> 00:05:42.030 align:middle line:90%
albeit a very persistent one.

00:05:42.030 --> 00:05:45.000 align:middle line:84%
So we're living in this
persistent illusion

00:05:45.000 --> 00:05:49.110 align:middle line:84%
of recognizable things
created by what?

00:05:49.110 --> 00:05:50.970 align:middle line:84%
The way they
explained it to you--

00:05:50.970 --> 00:05:54.120 align:middle line:84%
how did we create this
matrix that we all experience

00:05:54.120 --> 00:05:56.640 align:middle line:90%
in a somewhat similar way?

00:05:56.640 --> 00:06:02.040 align:middle line:84%
>>RENARD: Einstein described
this as a delusion also.

00:06:02.040 --> 00:06:03.740 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:06:03.740 --> 00:06:06.500 align:middle line:84%
>>RENARD: And I guess he
was a pretty smart guy.

00:06:06.500 --> 00:06:12.190 align:middle line:84%
But it's like the whole
thing is coming from us,

00:06:12.190 --> 00:06:16.630 align:middle line:84%
and this is something
that has been persistent

00:06:16.630 --> 00:06:18.850 align:middle line:84%
in the teachings
of Arten and Pursah

00:06:18.850 --> 00:06:21.950 align:middle line:84%
and also what they relate
about the teachings of Jesus

00:06:21.950 --> 00:06:22.750 align:middle line:90%
and Buddha.

00:06:22.750 --> 00:06:25.990 align:middle line:84%
The world is not
being done to us.

00:06:25.990 --> 00:06:28.360 align:middle line:90%
It's being done by us.

00:06:28.360 --> 00:06:31.210 align:middle line:84%
When you realize that,
then all of a sudden,

00:06:31.210 --> 00:06:36.430 align:middle line:84%
it shifts from being a victim,
where it's being done to you,

00:06:36.430 --> 00:06:40.180 align:middle line:84%
to not being a victim because
it's being done by you.

00:06:40.180 --> 00:06:43.270 align:middle line:90%
It really seems subtle at first.

00:06:43.270 --> 00:06:45.430 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: No, I'm
on board with you

00:06:45.430 --> 00:06:48.290 align:middle line:84%
completely that we're
cocreators in this.

00:06:48.290 --> 00:06:50.800 align:middle line:84%
And if you want to throw
Einstein into the mix

00:06:50.800 --> 00:06:53.020 align:middle line:84%
and looking at
everything as energy,

00:06:53.020 --> 00:06:55.150 align:middle line:84%
as not having any material
anyway, what is it

00:06:55.150 --> 00:06:59.710 align:middle line:84%
besides an expression of our
desire well thought and form?

00:06:59.710 --> 00:07:03.070 align:middle line:84%
>>RENARD: Well, my teachers
like to quote Einstein.

00:07:03.070 --> 00:07:05.710 align:middle line:84%
He said what we're
experiencing here

00:07:05.710 --> 00:07:10.300 align:middle line:84%
is an optical delusion
of consciousness.

00:07:10.300 --> 00:07:12.780 align:middle line:90%
So I think he understood that.

00:07:12.780 --> 00:07:14.790 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah, he did.

00:07:14.790 --> 00:07:16.500 align:middle line:84%
So that's where
they're coming from.

00:07:16.500 --> 00:07:21.010 align:middle line:84%
We're creating this illusion
that looks like our reality.

00:07:21.010 --> 00:07:23.760 align:middle line:84%
So now, going back
to your big question,

00:07:23.760 --> 00:07:27.120 align:middle line:84%
is who were Jesus and Buddha
before these entities became

00:07:27.120 --> 00:07:29.520 align:middle line:90%
known as Jesus and Buddha?

00:07:29.520 --> 00:07:31.800 align:middle line:84%
>>RENARD: Well,
this is something

00:07:31.800 --> 00:07:36.510 align:middle line:84%
that leads to mind
discipline because what

00:07:36.510 --> 00:07:41.960 align:middle line:84%
they learned was something that
was completely uncompromising.

00:07:41.960 --> 00:07:45.590 align:middle line:84%
What they learned was that
there is only one reality,

00:07:45.590 --> 00:07:48.140 align:middle line:90%
and that reality is a constant.

00:07:48.140 --> 00:07:49.890 align:middle line:84%
It's not something
that shifts or changes.

00:07:49.890 --> 00:07:52.610 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And how do they
describe to you that reality?

00:07:52.610 --> 00:07:55.100 align:middle line:84%
>>RENARD: That reality
cannot be described,

00:07:55.100 --> 00:07:57.960 align:middle line:90%
but it can be experienced.

00:07:57.960 --> 00:08:00.420 align:middle line:90%
And that's what they achieved.

00:08:00.420 --> 00:08:03.330 align:middle line:84%
They achieved their
perfect oneness

00:08:03.330 --> 00:08:07.740 align:middle line:84%
with God or heaven or
whatever you want to call it.

00:08:07.740 --> 00:08:09.510 align:middle line:84%
They achieved their
perfect oneness

00:08:09.510 --> 00:08:12.810 align:middle line:84%
with reality, which
has nothing to do

00:08:12.810 --> 00:08:15.930 align:middle line:84%
with this universe, nothing
to do with this place of time

00:08:15.930 --> 00:08:17.930 align:middle line:84%
and space, nothing
to do with anything

00:08:17.930 --> 00:08:19.620 align:middle line:90%
that shifts or changes.

00:08:19.620 --> 00:08:23.080 align:middle line:84%
And this has been touched upon
in other religions before.

00:08:23.080 --> 00:08:23.880 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:08:23.880 --> 00:08:27.420 align:middle line:84%
>>RENARD: But I think that
they achieved the experience

00:08:27.420 --> 00:08:29.400 align:middle line:90%
of that constancy.

00:08:29.400 --> 00:08:36.059 align:middle line:84%
So if you could move that
forward to today's teachings

00:08:36.059 --> 00:08:40.289 align:middle line:84%
of Jesus, which I would describe
as being the same in A Course

00:08:40.289 --> 00:08:44.820 align:middle line:84%
in Miracles," what it would
say is that whatever is true is

00:08:44.820 --> 00:08:48.350 align:middle line:84%
eternal and cannot
change or be changed,

00:08:48.350 --> 00:08:52.370 align:middle line:84%
which pretty much lets out
anything in this world of time

00:08:52.370 --> 00:08:54.170 align:middle line:90%
and space.

00:08:54.170 --> 00:08:56.810 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: OK, so
there's our platform.

00:08:56.810 --> 00:08:58.580 align:middle line:84%
You said in the
book that they had

00:08:58.580 --> 00:09:00.840 align:middle line:90%
about 40 lifetimes together.

00:09:00.840 --> 00:09:04.050 align:middle line:84%
So there was a process of
refinement that was going on.

00:09:04.050 --> 00:09:07.820 align:middle line:84%
And another thing that
was explained to you

00:09:07.820 --> 00:09:10.040 align:middle line:84%
was that the entity
known as Jesus

00:09:10.040 --> 00:09:14.720 align:middle line:84%
was not the ultimate leader but
actually the ultimate follower

00:09:14.720 --> 00:09:18.380 align:middle line:84%
because he only followed
the dictate of the higher

00:09:18.380 --> 00:09:20.420 align:middle line:84%
spirit-- his own
higher guidance,

00:09:20.420 --> 00:09:23.540 align:middle line:84%
his higher spirit, higher self,
all the different names we

00:09:23.540 --> 00:09:24.800 align:middle line:90%
have for it.

00:09:24.800 --> 00:09:26.770 align:middle line:90%
>>RENARD: That's a great point.

00:09:26.770 --> 00:09:29.310 align:middle line:84%
You know, people think of
Jesus as being, oh, wow,

00:09:29.310 --> 00:09:32.780 align:middle line:84%
this great messiah,
this great leader.

00:09:32.780 --> 00:09:34.370 align:middle line:90%
He wasn't like that at all.

00:09:34.370 --> 00:09:38.660 align:middle line:84%
What he was was
someone as he also

00:09:38.660 --> 00:09:41.720 align:middle line:84%
describes in "A Course in
Miracles," but before that.

00:09:41.720 --> 00:09:44.330 align:middle line:84%
He said, of myself,
I can do nothing.

00:09:44.330 --> 00:09:47.900 align:middle line:84%
He said he listened
to one voice.

00:09:47.900 --> 00:09:54.000 align:middle line:84%
He listened to the Holy Spirit,
which is what I'm trying to do.

00:09:54.000 --> 00:09:56.270 align:middle line:84%
I'm trying to just
listen to one voice.

00:09:56.270 --> 00:09:58.440 align:middle line:90%
If I ever listen to my voice--

00:09:58.440 --> 00:10:01.070 align:middle line:84%
I can look back on
my life, and when

00:10:01.070 --> 00:10:04.790 align:middle line:84%
I was listening to my voice,
it didn't turn out very well.

00:10:04.790 --> 00:10:06.280 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: I hear you.

00:10:06.280 --> 00:10:08.870 align:middle line:84%
>>RENARD: But when I
listened to the Holy Spirit,

00:10:08.870 --> 00:10:11.060 align:middle line:84%
things have actually
gone pretty good for me.

00:10:11.060 --> 00:10:12.560 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Yeah, I
agree with that.

00:10:12.560 --> 00:10:15.140 align:middle line:84%
>>RENARD: So it's like, of
myself, I can do nothing.

00:10:15.140 --> 00:10:17.660 align:middle line:84%
I just want to
listen to one voice.

00:10:17.660 --> 00:10:19.910 align:middle line:84%
And Jesus says in "A
Course in Miracles"--

00:10:19.910 --> 00:10:22.170 align:middle line:84%
because he is the voice
of "A Course in Miracles"

00:10:22.170 --> 00:10:24.670 align:middle line:84%
for those who are listening
who may not know that--

00:10:24.670 --> 00:10:30.030 align:middle line:84%
it's like he's saying eventually
I just listen to one voice.

00:10:30.030 --> 00:10:31.642 align:middle line:90%
So that makes him a follower.

00:10:31.642 --> 00:10:32.850 align:middle line:90%
It doesn't make him a leader.

00:10:32.850 --> 00:10:34.110 align:middle line:90%
It makes him a follower.

00:10:34.110 --> 00:10:36.450 align:middle line:84%
And he's saying that
you can be like him.

00:10:36.450 --> 00:10:38.740 align:middle line:84%
If you do the same
thing, if you do

00:10:38.740 --> 00:10:41.280 align:middle line:84%
what I did, if you
actually listen

00:10:41.280 --> 00:10:44.690 align:middle line:84%
to the Holy Spirit the way that
I did, then you can be like me.

00:10:44.690 --> 00:10:47.880 align:middle line:84%
And at first I heard
that-- because I had

00:10:47.880 --> 00:10:50.160 align:middle line:90%
read the Bible a little bit.

00:10:50.160 --> 00:10:51.690 align:middle line:84%
Not that I'm a
religious person--

00:10:51.690 --> 00:10:55.493 align:middle line:84%
I'm not-- but I'd read
the Bible a little bit.

00:10:55.493 --> 00:10:57.410 align:middle line:84%
When I started reading
"A Course in Miracles,"

00:10:57.410 --> 00:11:00.510 align:middle line:84%
it was like, oh, this guy
is saying that he's Jesus.

00:11:00.510 --> 00:11:02.250 align:middle line:84%
And I was thinking
this better be

00:11:02.250 --> 00:11:09.250 align:middle line:84%
good because it's not something
that everybody should say.

00:11:09.250 --> 00:11:13.620 align:middle line:84%
But when I started reading it,
it started to make sense to me.

00:11:13.620 --> 00:11:16.770 align:middle line:84%
And it was like,
OK, so now, he is

00:11:16.770 --> 00:11:22.060 align:middle line:84%
saying that instead of dragging
God down to our level, maybe

00:11:22.060 --> 00:11:27.400 align:middle line:84%
we should try to go up to
a higher level than human.

00:11:27.400 --> 00:11:29.990 align:middle line:84%
Because if you read
the Bible, that God

00:11:29.990 --> 00:11:32.350 align:middle line:84%
that we're given in
the Bible is very

00:11:32.350 --> 00:11:35.590 align:middle line:84%
human with all the
same human flaws

00:11:35.590 --> 00:11:37.360 align:middle line:90%
and getting even with people.

00:11:37.360 --> 00:11:39.840 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Yeah, certainly
in the Old Testament.

00:11:39.840 --> 00:11:43.030 align:middle line:84%
>>RENARD: Yeah, and even
in the New Testament,

00:11:43.030 --> 00:11:45.320 align:middle line:84%
how do you offer your
son as a blood sacrifice?

00:11:45.320 --> 00:11:47.560 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: No, there too.

00:11:47.560 --> 00:11:48.880 align:middle line:90%
We're on the same page.

00:11:48.880 --> 00:11:54.880 align:middle line:84%
>>RENARD: Yeah, and it's
like, wow, that's very human.

00:11:54.880 --> 00:11:58.900 align:middle line:84%
And what Jesus and
Buddha discovered

00:11:58.900 --> 00:12:01.340 align:middle line:90%
was that God is not human.

00:12:01.340 --> 00:12:05.530 align:middle line:84%
God does not think the way
that human beings think.

00:12:05.530 --> 00:12:08.870 align:middle line:84%
He thinks like God,
which is perfection.

00:12:08.870 --> 00:12:11.890 align:middle line:84%
And even the Bible
stumbles on the truth.

00:12:11.890 --> 00:12:15.280 align:middle line:84%
And "A Course in Miracles"
would say the exact same quote

00:12:15.280 --> 00:12:18.610 align:middle line:90%
that God is perfect love.

00:12:18.610 --> 00:12:21.380 align:middle line:84%
But we have to understand
the implications of that.

00:12:21.380 --> 00:12:25.040 align:middle line:84%
If God is perfect love, then
all that it would know how to do

00:12:25.040 --> 00:12:27.490 align:middle line:90%
would be to love.

00:12:27.490 --> 00:12:32.400 align:middle line:84%
If it was perfect, could it
have any imperfect thoughts?

00:12:32.400 --> 00:12:33.200 align:middle line:90%
No.

00:12:33.200 --> 00:12:35.300 align:middle line:84%
If it did, it
wouldn't be perfect.

00:12:35.300 --> 00:12:40.580 align:middle line:84%
Now, what that does is
it actually gives us

00:12:40.580 --> 00:12:45.710 align:middle line:84%
a perfect home to go home to,
which astounded me at first.

00:12:45.710 --> 00:12:48.740 align:middle line:84%
It was like, oh, wait
a minute because I

00:12:48.740 --> 00:12:52.850 align:middle line:90%
had been actually angry at God.

00:12:52.850 --> 00:12:56.270 align:middle line:84%
My parents had died
painful deaths.

00:12:56.270 --> 00:12:57.645 align:middle line:84%
I was looking at
the world, and I

00:12:57.645 --> 00:13:04.450 align:middle line:84%
was thinking what kind of a God
could make this kind of a world

00:13:04.450 --> 00:13:07.470 align:middle line:90%
where people suffer and die?

00:13:07.470 --> 00:13:09.460 align:middle line:90%
What kind of a God is this?

00:13:09.460 --> 00:13:12.900 align:middle line:90%
And then it was like, eureka--

00:13:12.900 --> 00:13:16.740 align:middle line:84%
all of a sudden,
yes, this gives us

00:13:16.740 --> 00:13:20.180 align:middle line:90%
a perfect tone to go home to.

00:13:20.180 --> 00:13:21.020 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Well said.

00:13:21.020 --> 00:13:23.150 align:middle line:84%
Now, let's get to
what Pursah said

00:13:23.150 --> 00:13:26.600 align:middle line:84%
because she said, in
terms of Jesus and Buddha,

00:13:26.600 --> 00:13:29.900 align:middle line:84%
that they were going to
acknowledge in the beginning

00:13:29.900 --> 00:13:33.260 align:middle line:84%
that there was no physical
evidence that they existed.

00:13:33.260 --> 00:13:35.510 align:middle line:84%
But they did exist,
and she explained it

00:13:35.510 --> 00:13:36.990 align:middle line:90%
slightly differently.

00:13:36.990 --> 00:13:38.240 align:middle line:90%
So can you explain that to us?

00:13:38.240 --> 00:13:39.890 align:middle line:84%
Because there are
many, many books

00:13:39.890 --> 00:13:43.190 align:middle line:84%
written about whether Jesus
was a true historical figure,

00:13:43.190 --> 00:13:48.290 align:middle line:84%
metaphorical figure that
comes so often to incarnate

00:13:48.290 --> 00:13:51.290 align:middle line:84%
as different entities
or to even guide

00:13:51.290 --> 00:13:56.780 align:middle line:84%
behind certain entities that
had elevated status historically

00:13:56.780 --> 00:13:57.980 align:middle line:90%
on a spiritual level.

00:13:57.980 --> 00:14:00.870 align:middle line:84%
So how did they
explain this entity?

00:14:00.870 --> 00:14:03.895 align:middle line:84%
>>RENARD: Well, basically the
entities did actually exist.

00:14:03.895 --> 00:14:05.270 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Just
that we don't have

00:14:05.270 --> 00:14:06.770 align:middle line:90%
the physical evidence for it?

00:14:06.770 --> 00:14:07.570 align:middle line:90%
>>RENARD: Right.

00:14:07.570 --> 00:14:11.840 align:middle line:84%
And they set the record straight
because there are stories

00:14:11.840 --> 00:14:13.790 align:middle line:90%
about Jesus that aren't true--

00:14:13.790 --> 00:14:15.830 align:middle line:84%
like him bursting his
way into the temple

00:14:15.830 --> 00:14:18.740 align:middle line:84%
and throwing tables
over and being

00:14:18.740 --> 00:14:21.770 align:middle line:90%
kind of like an angry person.

00:14:21.770 --> 00:14:23.720 align:middle line:90%
He was not like that ever.

00:14:23.720 --> 00:14:28.760 align:middle line:84%
So he and Mary
Magdalene were married.

00:14:28.760 --> 00:14:29.880 align:middle line:90%
They loved each other.

00:14:29.880 --> 00:14:34.910 align:middle line:84%
They had a perfectly
wonderful, loving relationship.

00:14:34.910 --> 00:14:38.840 align:middle line:84%
Something that my books say
that other people don't say

00:14:38.840 --> 00:14:41.360 align:middle line:84%
is that they didn't
have any children,

00:14:41.360 --> 00:14:43.140 align:middle line:90%
and others say that they did.

00:14:43.140 --> 00:14:46.580 align:middle line:84%
And some people have actually
gotten angry at me for saying

00:14:46.580 --> 00:14:47.930 align:middle line:90%
that they didn't.

00:14:47.930 --> 00:14:51.260 align:middle line:84%
But the truth is the
last thing that they

00:14:51.260 --> 00:14:55.850 align:middle line:84%
would have wanted to perpetuate
was a bloodline where people

00:14:55.850 --> 00:14:58.870 align:middle line:84%
would be looking for
ancestors of theirs

00:14:58.870 --> 00:15:02.750 align:middle line:84%
and making a big deal out of it
because they were not bodies,

00:15:02.750 --> 00:15:05.420 align:middle line:84%
and they knew that
they were not bodies.

00:15:05.420 --> 00:15:10.220 align:middle line:84%
Let me give you, if
I may, the temptation

00:15:10.220 --> 00:15:12.050 align:middle line:84%
definition from "A
Course in Miracles."

00:15:12.050 --> 00:15:15.260 align:middle line:84%
It says temptation has one
lesson it would teach in all

00:15:15.260 --> 00:15:18.410 align:middle line:90%
its forms, wherever it occurs.

00:15:18.410 --> 00:15:20.180 align:middle line:84%
It would persuade
the holy son of God

00:15:20.180 --> 00:15:24.260 align:middle line:84%
he is a body, born
in what must die,

00:15:24.260 --> 00:15:28.160 align:middle line:84%
unable to escape its
frailty, and bound

00:15:28.160 --> 00:15:31.940 align:middle line:90%
by what it orders him to feel.

00:15:31.940 --> 00:15:34.580 align:middle line:84%
That is temptation, not just
in "A Course in Miracles,"

00:15:34.580 --> 00:15:39.160 align:middle line:84%
but Jesus and Buddha discovered
that as they went along,

00:15:39.160 --> 00:15:39.960 align:middle line:90%
the ego--

00:15:39.960 --> 00:15:42.830 align:middle line:84%
which I will call this
thing called the ego, which

00:15:42.830 --> 00:15:45.830 align:middle line:90%
we think is real, which is us--

00:15:45.830 --> 00:15:48.560 align:middle line:84%
they discovered that
they were not bodies

00:15:48.560 --> 00:15:49.860 align:middle line:90%
just like the Course says.

00:15:49.860 --> 00:15:50.720 align:middle line:90%
I am not a body.

00:15:50.720 --> 00:15:55.160 align:middle line:84%
I am free for I am
still as God created me.

00:15:55.160 --> 00:15:59.990 align:middle line:84%
So it's like, wow,
what if I'm not a body?

00:15:59.990 --> 00:16:04.580 align:middle line:84%
What if there is
only one reality?

00:16:04.580 --> 00:16:07.760 align:middle line:84%
And what if it has
nothing to do with what

00:16:07.760 --> 00:16:08.930 align:middle line:90%
we are experiencing here?

00:16:08.930 --> 00:16:11.960 align:middle line:84%
What if what we are
experiencing here is false

00:16:11.960 --> 00:16:16.670 align:middle line:84%
and there is a reality that
is just beyond the veil?

00:16:16.670 --> 00:16:18.005 align:middle line:90%
Like, I'm looking at you, right?

00:16:18.005 --> 00:16:19.130 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah, I hear you.

00:16:19.130 --> 00:16:22.760 align:middle line:84%
>>RENARD: And I see
a body, and I'm not

00:16:22.760 --> 00:16:25.100 align:middle line:84%
pretending that I'm not
going to see a body when

00:16:25.100 --> 00:16:26.510 align:middle line:90%
I discover the truth.

00:16:26.510 --> 00:16:29.130 align:middle line:90%
But I know the truth about you.

00:16:29.130 --> 00:16:32.740 align:middle line:84%
There is something that
is just beyond the veil.

00:16:32.740 --> 00:16:38.500 align:middle line:84%
And what is just beyond the veil
is this perfect creation of God

00:16:38.500 --> 00:16:43.520 align:middle line:84%
that is a constancy that
can never be changed.

00:16:43.520 --> 00:16:45.460 align:middle line:90%
And if I see you that way--

00:16:45.460 --> 00:16:47.680 align:middle line:84%
there is this
wonderful quotation

00:16:47.680 --> 00:16:50.420 align:middle line:84%
at the end of the text of
"A Course in Miracles."

00:16:50.420 --> 00:16:53.260 align:middle line:84%
It says, as you see him,
you will see yourself.

00:16:53.260 --> 00:16:55.775 align:middle line:90%


00:16:55.775 --> 00:16:57.150 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: It makes
perfect sense,

00:16:57.150 --> 00:17:00.690 align:middle line:84%
and it would be a much more
gracious way for all of us

00:17:00.690 --> 00:17:04.290 align:middle line:84%
to go through life, if
we could manage that

00:17:04.290 --> 00:17:08.520 align:middle line:84%
through this very persistent
illusion of personality,

00:17:08.520 --> 00:17:13.770 align:middle line:84%
subconscious experience, pain,
trauma, and everything else

00:17:13.770 --> 00:17:16.882 align:middle line:84%
that's loaded into the
subconscious carried forward.

00:17:16.882 --> 00:17:19.410 align:middle line:84%
>>RENARD: Yeah, so what I want
to emphasize is that the way

00:17:19.410 --> 00:17:24.630 align:middle line:84%
that Jesus and Mary got in touch
with their own divinity was

00:17:24.630 --> 00:17:27.359 align:middle line:90%
by seeing it everywhere--

00:17:27.359 --> 00:17:28.960 align:middle line:90%
without compromise.

00:17:28.960 --> 00:17:30.583 align:middle line:90%
Now, that's not easy.

00:17:30.583 --> 00:17:33.000 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: No, it's not because
of things I just mentioned,

00:17:33.000 --> 00:17:33.800 align:middle line:90%
yeah.

00:17:33.800 --> 00:17:38.890 align:middle line:84%
>>RENARD: Yeah, and it has to
apply to everybody, period.

00:17:38.890 --> 00:17:44.330 align:middle line:84%
It's like you can't not
see that in one person.

00:17:44.330 --> 00:17:46.070 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Yes,
but they practiced

00:17:46.070 --> 00:17:48.890 align:middle line:84%
and they learned it while
in physical incarnations.

00:17:48.890 --> 00:17:50.780 align:middle line:84%
And that is what your
book is referring

00:17:50.780 --> 00:17:53.120 align:middle line:84%
to is some of the ways in
which they were trained,

00:17:53.120 --> 00:17:56.610 align:middle line:84%
training themselves forward
into this unity consciousness.

00:17:56.610 --> 00:17:59.450 align:middle line:84%
And let's get into some
of the particulars.

00:17:59.450 --> 00:18:03.950 align:middle line:84%
Let's get into a time when they
were amidst those in the Shinto

00:18:03.950 --> 00:18:08.960 align:middle line:84%
tradition, as Jesus was Saka
and Buddhist was Hiroji,

00:18:08.960 --> 00:18:12.410 align:middle line:84%
and they had a very deep
friendship and faith and also

00:18:12.410 --> 00:18:13.830 align:middle line:90%
mystical experiences.

00:18:13.830 --> 00:18:16.340 align:middle line:84%
So let's talk about what
they learned at that time

00:18:16.340 --> 00:18:18.200 align:middle line:90%
in Shintoism.

00:18:18.200 --> 00:18:19.608 align:middle line:90%
>>RENARD: Well, sure.

00:18:19.608 --> 00:18:21.150 align:middle line:84%
And the book is
called "The Lifetimes

00:18:21.150 --> 00:18:23.180 align:middle line:84%
When Jesus and Buddha
Knew Each Other,"

00:18:23.180 --> 00:18:26.010 align:middle line:84%
and even though they
knew each other in about

00:18:26.010 --> 00:18:28.230 align:middle line:84%
40 different lifetimes,
there's about six

00:18:28.230 --> 00:18:29.450 align:middle line:90%
that are really highlighted--

00:18:29.450 --> 00:18:31.020 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Yeah, and
that's what we focus on.

00:18:31.020 --> 00:18:32.100 align:middle line:90%
>>RENARD: --in the book.

00:18:32.100 --> 00:18:36.460 align:middle line:90%
It's like they were friends.

00:18:36.460 --> 00:18:41.890 align:middle line:84%
They were Shintos who
were very similar,

00:18:41.890 --> 00:18:46.060 align:middle line:84%
I would say, to the
New Age people of today

00:18:46.060 --> 00:18:49.120 align:middle line:84%
because they were exploring
different ways of looking

00:18:49.120 --> 00:18:50.690 align:middle line:90%
at things.

00:18:50.690 --> 00:18:54.410 align:middle line:90%
And so they were very advanced.

00:18:54.410 --> 00:18:56.740 align:middle line:84%
They actually learned
to communicate

00:18:56.740 --> 00:19:00.010 align:middle line:90%
with animals in that lifetime.

00:19:00.010 --> 00:19:01.450 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Telepathically, yeah.

00:19:01.450 --> 00:19:02.380 align:middle line:90%
>>RENARD: Yeah.

00:19:02.380 --> 00:19:04.750 align:middle line:84%
And by the way, if you want
to communicate with animals,

00:19:04.750 --> 00:19:09.340 align:middle line:84%
I've learned from them, you
want to do it with pictures

00:19:09.340 --> 00:19:13.930 align:middle line:84%
not words because animals
don't think in terms of words.

00:19:13.930 --> 00:19:16.210 align:middle line:90%
They think in terms of pictures.

00:19:16.210 --> 00:19:19.540 align:middle line:84%
And I learned this from my
cat because I experimented.

00:19:19.540 --> 00:19:23.300 align:middle line:84%
And when I used to say words
to her, it meant nothing.

00:19:23.300 --> 00:19:27.730 align:middle line:84%
But when I sent mental
pictures to her,

00:19:27.730 --> 00:19:29.180 align:middle line:90%
I was actually communicating.

00:19:29.180 --> 00:19:31.630 align:middle line:84%
And you can do
that with animals.

00:19:31.630 --> 00:19:37.150 align:middle line:84%
And they were very advanced
for Shintoism at that time.

00:19:37.150 --> 00:19:39.460 align:middle line:90%
And it was like--

00:19:39.460 --> 00:19:42.250 align:middle line:84%
they also had personal
forgiveness lessons

00:19:42.250 --> 00:19:45.070 align:middle line:84%
because they fell in
love with the same woman.

00:19:45.070 --> 00:19:51.640 align:middle line:84%
Now, that woman, much later in
the linear scheme of things,

00:19:51.640 --> 00:19:53.380 align:middle line:90%
turned out to be Mary Magdalene.

00:19:53.380 --> 00:19:56.500 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Her name was
Megumi in this story.

00:19:56.500 --> 00:19:58.090 align:middle line:90%
>>RENARD: That's right.

00:19:58.090 --> 00:20:00.550 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: There was jealousy.

00:20:00.550 --> 00:20:03.040 align:middle line:84%
There were a lot of
human traits that

00:20:03.040 --> 00:20:06.280 align:middle line:84%
were happening between
these two over this woman.

00:20:06.280 --> 00:20:08.410 align:middle line:84%
Let's talk about
how that story went.

00:20:08.410 --> 00:20:12.540 align:middle line:84%
>>RENARD: Well, they both
wanted her very much.

00:20:12.540 --> 00:20:16.340 align:middle line:84%
And because of the
time and place,

00:20:16.340 --> 00:20:20.330 align:middle line:84%
the emperor said who
is going to marry who,

00:20:20.330 --> 00:20:23.420 align:middle line:84%
and neither one of them
got to be with her.

00:20:23.420 --> 00:20:27.470 align:middle line:84%
So it ended up being, at
first, a forgiveness lesson

00:20:27.470 --> 00:20:32.030 align:middle line:84%
and jealousy, and then
eventually a forgiveness

00:20:32.030 --> 00:20:35.470 align:middle line:90%
lesson in unrequited love.

00:20:35.470 --> 00:20:38.260 align:middle line:84%
So there were a couple of
huge forgiveness lessons.

00:20:38.260 --> 00:20:39.670 align:middle line:90%
But you know what?

00:20:39.670 --> 00:20:41.698 align:middle line:84%
They still ended
up being friends.

00:20:41.698 --> 00:20:43.240 align:middle line:84%
And I think that
was very interesting

00:20:43.240 --> 00:20:46.690 align:middle line:84%
because they were spiritually
advanced enough to realize that

00:20:46.690 --> 00:20:49.420 align:middle line:84%
even though things
didn't work out the way

00:20:49.420 --> 00:20:51.660 align:middle line:84%
that they wanted
them to work out,

00:20:51.660 --> 00:20:57.935 align:middle line:84%
that they could use that as some
kind of spiritual advancement.

00:20:57.935 --> 00:20:59.810 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: By really
embracing the lesson that

00:20:59.810 --> 00:21:01.690 align:middle line:90%
was being shown them.

00:21:01.690 --> 00:21:04.190 align:middle line:90%
>>RENARD: Yeah, that is so true.

00:21:04.190 --> 00:21:07.390 align:middle line:84%
So let's say that we
have two identities.

00:21:07.390 --> 00:21:11.170 align:middle line:84%
You have your ego, which is
the false identity, which

00:21:11.170 --> 00:21:13.390 align:middle line:84%
is that part of
the mind that wants

00:21:13.390 --> 00:21:17.100 align:middle line:84%
to make this whole thing real
and get you to react to it.

00:21:17.100 --> 00:21:22.200 align:middle line:84%
Then you have the real you,
which is kind of like--

00:21:22.200 --> 00:21:24.690 align:middle line:84%
we'll call it spirit,
the Holy Spirit,

00:21:24.690 --> 00:21:28.010 align:middle line:84%
which is telling you that
what you're seeing is not true

00:21:28.010 --> 00:21:31.740 align:middle line:84%
and that there is a reality
that is just beyond the veil.

00:21:31.740 --> 00:21:33.390 align:middle line:84%
It reminds me of
something that--

00:21:33.390 --> 00:21:37.080 align:middle line:84%
you can see this in the gospel
of Thomas, 2,000 years ago.

00:21:37.080 --> 00:21:40.920 align:middle line:84%
The disciples went up
to Jesus and we said,

00:21:40.920 --> 00:21:43.220 align:middle line:90%
when will the kingdom come?

00:21:43.220 --> 00:21:48.150 align:middle line:84%
And he said, well, it will
not come by watching for it.

00:21:48.150 --> 00:21:51.480 align:middle line:84%
Will not be said behold
here or behold there.

00:21:51.480 --> 00:21:52.890 align:middle line:84%
Rather, the kingdom
of the father

00:21:52.890 --> 00:21:57.705 align:middle line:84%
is spread out upon the Earth
and people do not see it.

00:21:57.705 --> 00:21:59.330 align:middle line:84%
Well, the reason that
they don't see it

00:21:59.330 --> 00:22:02.983 align:middle line:84%
is because it's out
of their awareness.

00:22:02.983 --> 00:22:04.400 align:middle line:84%
That's why "A
Course in Miracles,"

00:22:04.400 --> 00:22:06.920 align:middle line:84%
in its brilliant
introduction, says

00:22:06.920 --> 00:22:11.000 align:middle line:84%
that it's about removing
the blocks to the awareness

00:22:11.000 --> 00:22:12.550 align:middle line:90%
of love's presence.

00:22:12.550 --> 00:22:14.300 align:middle line:84%
And let's remember,
"A Course in Miracles"

00:22:14.300 --> 00:22:15.800 align:middle line:90%
is a very big teaching.

00:22:15.800 --> 00:22:17.960 align:middle line:84%
It's not the piddly
small teaching

00:22:17.960 --> 00:22:20.210 align:middle line:84%
that most of its
teacher present it as.

00:22:20.210 --> 00:22:21.950 align:middle line:90%
It's a very big teaching.

00:22:21.950 --> 00:22:24.470 align:middle line:84%
And it's saying that if
you remove those blocks

00:22:24.470 --> 00:22:26.420 align:middle line:84%
to the awareness of
love's presence--

00:22:26.420 --> 00:22:29.400 align:middle line:90%
love in the Course means God--

00:22:29.400 --> 00:22:31.800 align:middle line:90%
you can experience God.

00:22:31.800 --> 00:22:35.370 align:middle line:84%
And I have been fortunate enough
to have that experience, where

00:22:35.370 --> 00:22:39.270 align:middle line:84%
you undo those blocks of that
awareness, which means undoing

00:22:39.270 --> 00:22:43.560 align:middle line:84%
the ego, undoing the faults
you, which is why the Course is

00:22:43.560 --> 00:22:46.680 align:middle line:84%
about mind training because
you have to have that knowledge

00:22:46.680 --> 00:22:49.830 align:middle line:84%
to undo the ego through a
certain kind of forgiveness

00:22:49.830 --> 00:22:52.450 align:middle line:90%
that doesn't make it real.

00:22:52.450 --> 00:22:56.130 align:middle line:84%
And when you do that, it'll
lead you to an experience.

00:22:56.130 --> 00:23:00.900 align:middle line:84%
So the ironic thing, I think,
about "A Course in Miracles"

00:23:00.900 --> 00:23:03.840 align:middle line:84%
is that you get a half
a million words that

00:23:03.840 --> 00:23:06.900 align:middle line:84%
is meant to lead you
to an experience that

00:23:06.900 --> 00:23:09.220 align:middle line:90%
is beyond all words.

00:23:09.220 --> 00:23:11.073 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Yes, and
one truth only,

00:23:11.073 --> 00:23:12.490 align:middle line:84%
which, if it could
be articulated,

00:23:12.490 --> 00:23:14.050 align:middle line:90%
would happen in a sentence.

00:23:14.050 --> 00:23:16.780 align:middle line:84%
>>RENARD: So the truth
cannot be suppressed.

00:23:16.780 --> 00:23:22.530 align:middle line:84%
I can't tell you the truth, but
you can experience the truth.

00:23:22.530 --> 00:23:25.930 align:middle line:84%
And when you express
it, it's beyond anything

00:23:25.930 --> 00:23:29.480 align:middle line:84%
that can be described
because it's perfect.

00:23:29.480 --> 00:23:32.920 align:middle line:84%
It's absolutely non
dualistic because there

00:23:32.920 --> 00:23:34.990 align:middle line:90%
are no this and that.

00:23:34.990 --> 00:23:37.015 align:middle line:84%
There's no scarcity
and abundance.

00:23:37.015 --> 00:23:38.140 align:middle line:90%
There is no life and death.

00:23:38.140 --> 00:23:39.580 align:middle line:90%
There is only life.

00:23:39.580 --> 00:23:41.020 align:middle line:90%
There is only abundance.

00:23:41.020 --> 00:23:45.780 align:middle line:84%
There is only that one thing
instead of that duality.

00:23:45.780 --> 00:23:48.100 align:middle line:84%
And it is also a very
sexual experience,

00:23:48.100 --> 00:23:51.290 align:middle line:84%
which people don't always like
it when I talk about that.

00:23:51.290 --> 00:23:53.410 align:middle line:84%
But when you have that
kind of experience

00:23:53.410 --> 00:23:56.890 align:middle line:84%
with your perfect oneness with
God, which the Course describes

00:23:56.890 --> 00:24:03.630 align:middle line:84%
your experience with God as
being extremely personal,

00:24:03.630 --> 00:24:06.840 align:middle line:90%
it's like a constant orgasm.

00:24:06.840 --> 00:24:09.280 align:middle line:90%
It's like it never stops.

00:24:09.280 --> 00:24:12.060 align:middle line:90%
It's just there.

00:24:12.060 --> 00:24:16.140 align:middle line:84%
And when I first heard that
from my very attractive teacher,

00:24:16.140 --> 00:24:18.766 align:middle line:84%
Pursah, I said, hey, give
me more of that, you know.

00:24:18.766 --> 00:24:22.090 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: [CHUCKLES] You were
definitely in the 3D plane

00:24:22.090 --> 00:24:24.020 align:middle line:90%
when you said that.

00:24:24.020 --> 00:24:28.690 align:middle line:84%
So OK, now, let's continue
with their learning

00:24:28.690 --> 00:24:31.180 align:middle line:84%
as they're starting to
embrace these concepts,

00:24:31.180 --> 00:24:35.230 align:middle line:84%
this lack of duality,
moving beyond duality.

00:24:35.230 --> 00:24:38.740 align:middle line:84%
They came into
contact with Lao Tzu.

00:24:38.740 --> 00:24:43.090 align:middle line:84%
And I found that really
an interesting period.

00:24:43.090 --> 00:24:48.250 align:middle line:84%
And Jesus was a female,
Shao Li; Buddha was Wosan.

00:24:48.250 --> 00:24:50.710 align:middle line:84%
And they both had
psychic abilities.

00:24:50.710 --> 00:24:55.210 align:middle line:84%
And they had to move
away from their family

00:24:55.210 --> 00:24:56.560 align:middle line:90%
in order to follow this path.

00:24:56.560 --> 00:24:59.380 align:middle line:84%
Let's talk about their
lives with Lao Tzu.

00:24:59.380 --> 00:25:03.310 align:middle line:84%
>>RENARD: Well, one
thing about Lao Tzu

00:25:03.310 --> 00:25:08.260 align:middle line:84%
is that Buddha actually
learned a lot from Lao Tzu.

00:25:08.260 --> 00:25:12.340 align:middle line:84%
And sometimes people actually
confuse the sayings of the two

00:25:12.340 --> 00:25:14.980 align:middle line:84%
because people say, oh, Lao Tzu
said this, or Buddha said that.

00:25:14.980 --> 00:25:17.440 align:middle line:84%
And sometimes they'll
say Buddha said that,

00:25:17.440 --> 00:25:19.870 align:middle line:90%
when it was actually Lao Tzu.

00:25:19.870 --> 00:25:23.170 align:middle line:90%
And they were very similar.

00:25:23.170 --> 00:25:26.330 align:middle line:90%
And it's like, yeah.

00:25:26.330 --> 00:25:29.960 align:middle line:84%
I think the interesting
thing about Jesus and Buddha

00:25:29.960 --> 00:25:32.840 align:middle line:84%
lifetime at that
time was that they

00:25:32.840 --> 00:25:38.990 align:middle line:84%
had the typical male-female
relationship, which

00:25:38.990 --> 00:25:42.100 align:middle line:84%
I am experiencing right
now with my wife Cindy.

00:25:42.100 --> 00:25:47.960 align:middle line:84%
And it's like, yes,
you have certain things

00:25:47.960 --> 00:25:49.740 align:middle line:90%
that will come up.

00:25:49.740 --> 00:25:52.090 align:middle line:90%
I call them love bargains.

00:25:52.090 --> 00:25:54.590 align:middle line:84%
It's like maybe you want that
person to do something for you

00:25:54.590 --> 00:25:56.660 align:middle line:90%
sexually, and you expect it.

00:25:56.660 --> 00:26:00.380 align:middle line:84%
And then when it doesn't
happen, then all of a sudden

00:26:00.380 --> 00:26:02.380 align:middle line:90%
it's a problem.

00:26:02.380 --> 00:26:05.570 align:middle line:84%
It's like watch out because if
that person isn't performing

00:26:05.570 --> 00:26:07.490 align:middle line:84%
the way that you want
them to and you've

00:26:07.490 --> 00:26:12.600 align:middle line:84%
come to expect them to, that is
a big forgiveness opportunity.

00:26:12.600 --> 00:26:17.950 align:middle line:84%
And in that lifetime, they
had that kind of thing.

00:26:17.950 --> 00:26:19.830 align:middle line:84%
So you could see that
Jesus and Buddha,

00:26:19.830 --> 00:26:23.880 align:middle line:84%
through the six lifetimes that
are portrayed in the book, kind

00:26:23.880 --> 00:26:26.890 align:middle line:84%
of like ran the gamut of
the kinds of forgiveness

00:26:26.890 --> 00:26:28.050 align:middle line:90%
opportunities that we have.

00:26:28.050 --> 00:26:30.300 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Because this one
did have to do with desire,

00:26:30.300 --> 00:26:33.310 align:middle line:84%
and it sounds as though
it was Shao Li who asks,

00:26:33.310 --> 00:26:35.127 align:middle line:90%
how can I have no desire?

00:26:35.127 --> 00:26:37.460 align:middle line:84%
And they did ultimately have
children together, the two.

00:26:37.460 --> 00:26:38.400 align:middle line:90%
>>RENARD: Right.

00:26:38.400 --> 00:26:41.560 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And this has
really, for me, always been--

00:26:41.560 --> 00:26:47.040 align:middle line:84%
there are two words that I
react to, and one of them

00:26:47.040 --> 00:26:48.990 align:middle line:84%
is forgiveness, and
one of them is desire.

00:26:48.990 --> 00:26:52.500 align:middle line:84%
And these are heavily laced
through these stories.

00:26:52.500 --> 00:26:55.680 align:middle line:84%
Just on a personal
level looking at all

00:26:55.680 --> 00:26:58.830 align:middle line:84%
of life, all of creation,
nothing happens without desire.

00:26:58.830 --> 00:27:00.940 align:middle line:90%
Without desire, nothing exists.

00:27:00.940 --> 00:27:04.860 align:middle line:84%
So the whole notion
in what is considered

00:27:04.860 --> 00:27:07.530 align:middle line:84%
to be Buddhist tradition
of releasing desire

00:27:07.530 --> 00:27:11.970 align:middle line:84%
because desires is at the base
of all suffering, that's never

00:27:11.970 --> 00:27:13.800 align:middle line:90%
resonated with me.

00:27:13.800 --> 00:27:17.550 align:middle line:84%
Now, I do understand
it on a material level.

00:27:17.550 --> 00:27:19.950 align:middle line:84%
If you keep trying to go
after something that's

00:27:19.950 --> 00:27:21.550 align:middle line:84%
not serving you
and not showing up,

00:27:21.550 --> 00:27:22.883 align:middle line:90%
you're going to be disappointed.

00:27:22.883 --> 00:27:24.870 align:middle line:84%
But if you're listening
to that higher voice

00:27:24.870 --> 00:27:28.860 align:middle line:84%
and you're following that, then
desire is a beautiful thing.

00:27:28.860 --> 00:27:32.760 align:middle line:84%
It's what allows
that to manifest.

00:27:32.760 --> 00:27:34.691 align:middle line:90%
What's your take on the desire?

00:27:34.691 --> 00:27:39.948 align:middle line:84%
>>RENARD: [CHUCKLES] Do you
have any difficult questions?

00:27:39.948 --> 00:27:41.490 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: To me,
it's kind of simple.

00:27:41.490 --> 00:27:43.140 align:middle line:84%
If you follow a
higher directive,

00:27:43.140 --> 00:27:45.690 align:middle line:84%
desire is what propels
it into reality.

00:27:45.690 --> 00:27:49.980 align:middle line:84%
If you're following
lower 3D, lower desires,

00:27:49.980 --> 00:27:51.870 align:middle line:84%
it can cause a lot of
suffering and problems.

00:27:51.870 --> 00:27:54.060 align:middle line:84%
So I can see what
they're talking about.

00:27:54.060 --> 00:27:59.000 align:middle line:84%
>>RENARD: So there's an
interesting thing there.

00:27:59.000 --> 00:28:02.780 align:middle line:84%
First of all, you have to
throw the whole thing out.

00:28:02.780 --> 00:28:07.147 align:middle line:84%
Nothing here is worth desiring
because none of it's true.

00:28:07.147 --> 00:28:09.480 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Yet, if you're
following that higher directive

00:28:09.480 --> 00:28:13.470 align:middle line:84%
from the higher source, as
Jesus and the other avatars

00:28:13.470 --> 00:28:16.860 align:middle line:84%
and great beings have
done, that desire

00:28:16.860 --> 00:28:20.140 align:middle line:90%
does manifest in something.

00:28:20.140 --> 00:28:23.827 align:middle line:84%
>>RENARD: But there is kind
of an interesting twist.

00:28:23.827 --> 00:28:24.910 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: OK, what's that?

00:28:24.910 --> 00:28:27.618 align:middle line:84%
>>RENARD: The twist
is it doesn't matter.

00:28:27.618 --> 00:28:28.660 align:middle line:90%
It really doesn't matter.

00:28:28.660 --> 00:28:30.660 align:middle line:90%
None of it's true.

00:28:30.660 --> 00:28:34.770 align:middle line:84%
But at the same time, while
you appear to be here,

00:28:34.770 --> 00:28:36.420 align:middle line:84%
you're probably going
to do something,

00:28:36.420 --> 00:28:38.290 align:middle line:84%
and you're probably going
to want to do something.

00:28:38.290 --> 00:28:40.373 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Well, there is
a reason for coming here,

00:28:40.373 --> 00:28:42.650 align:middle line:84%
otherwise don't
bother incarnating.

00:28:42.650 --> 00:28:44.510 align:middle line:84%
>>RENARD: Well, that's
a different subject.

00:28:44.510 --> 00:28:45.860 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: [CHUCKLES]

00:28:45.860 --> 00:28:48.020 align:middle line:84%
>>RENARD: But-- and
nobody in their right mind

00:28:48.020 --> 00:28:49.590 align:middle line:90%
would come here.

00:28:49.590 --> 00:28:52.370 align:middle line:90%
But that's a different subject.

00:28:52.370 --> 00:28:57.350 align:middle line:84%
But the thing is it's like
while you appear to be here,

00:28:57.350 --> 00:28:59.415 align:middle line:90%
it's possible to be guided--

00:28:59.415 --> 00:29:00.290 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Absolutely.

00:29:00.290 --> 00:29:02.900 align:middle line:84%
>>RENARD: --by the Holy
Spirit as to what you should

00:29:02.900 --> 00:29:05.300 align:middle line:90%
do while you appear to be here.

00:29:05.300 --> 00:29:07.910 align:middle line:84%
And the more that you undo
the ego through a certain kind

00:29:07.910 --> 00:29:10.670 align:middle line:84%
of forgiveness that doesn't
make it real, the more

00:29:10.670 --> 00:29:13.100 align:middle line:84%
that you allow the Holy
Spirit to enter your mind

00:29:13.100 --> 00:29:15.890 align:middle line:90%
and give you these ideas.

00:29:15.890 --> 00:29:19.070 align:middle line:84%
There was a time in my life
when I didn't know what anything

00:29:19.070 --> 00:29:21.680 align:middle line:84%
was for, and now I
know what everything

00:29:21.680 --> 00:29:23.240 align:middle line:84%
is for because I
have the Holy Spirit

00:29:23.240 --> 00:29:27.110 align:middle line:84%
to tell me what
it's for, and I can

00:29:27.110 --> 00:29:32.080 align:middle line:84%
be inspired with these ideas
that I never would have had--

00:29:32.080 --> 00:29:34.580 align:middle line:84%
like you should go here;
you should do this--

00:29:34.580 --> 00:29:37.530 align:middle line:84%
and these are very
practical ideas.

00:29:37.530 --> 00:29:39.920 align:middle line:10%
That's why I say that
this kind of spirituality

00:29:39.920 --> 00:29:43.850 align:middle line:10%
can be very practical because
not only are you working

00:29:43.850 --> 00:29:47.090 align:middle line:10%
your way home to God,
but at the same time,

00:29:47.090 --> 00:29:50.390 align:middle line:10%
you can be guided by the
Holy Spirit as to how

00:29:50.390 --> 00:29:53.300 align:middle line:10%
you can be the most
helpful to other people

00:29:53.300 --> 00:29:55.210 align:middle line:10%
and help them get
their way home to God.

00:29:55.210 --> 00:29:57.420 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: I totally
agree with you on that.

00:29:57.420 --> 00:29:58.400 align:middle line:90%
So here we are.

00:29:58.400 --> 00:30:00.800 align:middle line:84%
So they have worked
through the desire.

00:30:00.800 --> 00:30:03.590 align:middle line:84%
Now, as male and female,
they've come together.

00:30:03.590 --> 00:30:05.390 align:middle line:84%
They've had four
children together.

00:30:05.390 --> 00:30:08.630 align:middle line:84%
But what was the big
takeaway in that one

00:30:08.630 --> 00:30:10.730 align:middle line:84%
because I have an
interesting question that's

00:30:10.730 --> 00:30:12.980 align:middle line:84%
going to follow up here,
especially what you just said

00:30:12.980 --> 00:30:14.510 align:middle line:90%
about who would incarnate here?

00:30:14.510 --> 00:30:19.642 align:middle line:84%
So what was the big takeaway
as the two devotees of Lao Tzu?

00:30:19.642 --> 00:30:21.880 align:middle line:84%
>>RENARD: I think
the big takeaway was

00:30:21.880 --> 00:30:26.290 align:middle line:84%
their major introduction to
a certain kind of forgiveness

00:30:26.290 --> 00:30:28.870 align:middle line:84%
that most of the
world is not aware of.

00:30:28.870 --> 00:30:32.470 align:middle line:84%
Because even when you
use the word forgiveness,

00:30:32.470 --> 00:30:34.640 align:middle line:90%
people still make it real.

00:30:34.640 --> 00:30:36.910 align:middle line:84%
It's like I'm forgiving you
because you really did it.

00:30:36.910 --> 00:30:39.070 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Yeah, I
don't like that word,

00:30:39.070 --> 00:30:44.380 align:middle line:84%
>>RENARD: And what they did was
they started to discover that

00:30:44.380 --> 00:30:47.620 align:middle line:90%
if this is my projection--

00:30:47.620 --> 00:30:49.990 align:middle line:84%
and that was really
their introduction

00:30:49.990 --> 00:30:52.600 align:middle line:84%
to the whole idea
of projection--

00:30:52.600 --> 00:30:54.670 align:middle line:84%
if it's being done
by me, then why

00:30:54.670 --> 00:30:56.800 align:middle line:84%
am I forgiving people
because they really

00:30:56.800 --> 00:30:59.770 align:middle line:84%
did it, when I should
be forgiving people

00:30:59.770 --> 00:31:01.570 align:middle line:84%
because they haven't
really done anything

00:31:01.570 --> 00:31:04.170 align:middle line:84%
because I'm the one who made
it up in the first place?

00:31:04.170 --> 00:31:06.580 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: This gets
highly esoteric--

00:31:06.580 --> 00:31:08.240 align:middle line:90%
and practical.

00:31:08.240 --> 00:31:11.650 align:middle line:84%
OK, one thing-- by the
way, this is a little aside

00:31:11.650 --> 00:31:14.770 align:middle line:84%
that I learned recently
doing some research

00:31:14.770 --> 00:31:16.272 align:middle line:90%
for different interview.

00:31:16.272 --> 00:31:18.730 align:middle line:84%
It had to do with Lao Tzu, and
they were saying his mother,

00:31:18.730 --> 00:31:20.750 align:middle line:90%
Lao, became--

00:31:20.750 --> 00:31:24.960 align:middle line:84%
it was another divine birth,
another immaculate conception

00:31:24.960 --> 00:31:29.360 align:middle line:84%
in that the story was that
she saw a falling comet,

00:31:29.360 --> 00:31:32.180 align:middle line:84%
and then she became
imbued and impregnated

00:31:32.180 --> 00:31:34.220 align:middle line:90%
and that's what he came from.

00:31:34.220 --> 00:31:36.560 align:middle line:90%
So anyway, that's just an aside.

00:31:36.560 --> 00:31:38.322 align:middle line:84%
So this is the
part that follows.

00:31:38.322 --> 00:31:40.280 align:middle line:84%
You just said no one
would choose to come here,

00:31:40.280 --> 00:31:41.630 align:middle line:90%
and it's all an illusion.

00:31:41.630 --> 00:31:44.840 align:middle line:84%
And this says lifetime
fascinations are

00:31:44.840 --> 00:31:47.370 align:middle line:90%
scripted all the way through.

00:31:47.370 --> 00:31:49.460 align:middle line:84%
So let's talk about
that for a moment.

00:31:49.460 --> 00:31:52.370 align:middle line:84%
>>RENARD: Well, this is
the script that has already

00:31:52.370 --> 00:31:57.860 align:middle line:84%
been written, and you and me are
reviewing mentally that which

00:31:57.860 --> 00:31:59.780 align:middle line:90%
has already gone by.

00:31:59.780 --> 00:32:04.720 align:middle line:84%
So this whole thing
has already been done.

00:32:04.720 --> 00:32:06.452 align:middle line:90%
We are not here.

00:32:06.452 --> 00:32:10.960 align:middle line:84%
We are not in bodies, which
is the main teaching of Jesus

00:32:10.960 --> 00:32:11.760 align:middle line:90%
and Buddha.

00:32:11.760 --> 00:32:12.610 align:middle line:90%
I'm not a body.

00:32:12.610 --> 00:32:13.410 align:middle line:90%
I'm free.

00:32:13.410 --> 00:32:16.230 align:middle line:84%
For I am still as
God created me.

00:32:16.230 --> 00:32:21.300 align:middle line:84%
And what this is--
it's just nothing.

00:32:21.300 --> 00:32:24.223 align:middle line:84%
And the question is what
are you going to do with it?

00:32:24.223 --> 00:32:25.890 align:middle line:84%
What are you going
to do with that which

00:32:25.890 --> 00:32:27.090 align:middle line:90%
you are mentally reviewing?

00:32:27.090 --> 00:32:29.370 align:middle line:84%
It's kind of like you're
in a movie theater,

00:32:29.370 --> 00:32:31.650 align:middle line:84%
and the movie has
already even filmed.

00:32:31.650 --> 00:32:33.808 align:middle line:84%
You're not going to
change the movie.

00:32:33.808 --> 00:32:34.850 align:middle line:90%
It's already been filmed.

00:32:34.850 --> 00:32:36.330 align:middle line:90%
It's already there.

00:32:36.330 --> 00:32:39.718 align:middle line:84%
What you can change is your
interpretation of the movie.

00:32:39.718 --> 00:32:42.260 align:middle line:84%
So it's like you've got the Holy
Spirit sitting on this side,

00:32:42.260 --> 00:32:44.370 align:middle line:84%
and you've got the ego
sitting on this side.

00:32:44.370 --> 00:32:48.420 align:middle line:84%
And the ego is saying this is
real, and you can't forgive it.

00:32:48.420 --> 00:32:49.670 align:middle line:90%
They don't deserve this--

00:32:49.670 --> 00:32:51.300 align:middle line:90%
those bastards don't deserve it.

00:32:51.300 --> 00:32:52.830 align:middle line:84%
And the Holy Spirit
is saying well,

00:32:52.830 --> 00:32:56.700 align:middle line:84%
you know, it's just a
movie, and you made it,

00:32:56.700 --> 00:33:00.330 align:middle line:84%
and you can forgive it
because it's nothing.

00:33:00.330 --> 00:33:04.020 align:middle line:84%
And which interpretation
are you going to listen to?

00:33:04.020 --> 00:33:06.610 align:middle line:90%


00:33:06.610 --> 00:33:09.620 align:middle line:84%
So I choose to listen
to Holy Spirit.

00:33:09.620 --> 00:33:10.420 align:middle line:90%
And you know what?

00:33:10.420 --> 00:33:13.870 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: But let me ask a
followup question on that.

00:33:13.870 --> 00:33:16.520 align:middle line:84%
Who is it that has already
scripted the script?

00:33:16.520 --> 00:33:18.540 align:middle line:90%
Who's created the script?

00:33:18.540 --> 00:33:20.290 align:middle line:84%
>>RENARD: Well, who
created the script was

00:33:20.290 --> 00:33:23.590 align:middle line:84%
what I would call the ego,
which is the idea of separation

00:33:23.590 --> 00:33:27.190 align:middle line:84%
really, the false belief that
you could separate yourself

00:33:27.190 --> 00:33:29.380 align:middle line:90%
from your creator.

00:33:29.380 --> 00:33:31.630 align:middle line:84%
Now, that couldn't
happen in reality,

00:33:31.630 --> 00:33:35.350 align:middle line:84%
but it did happen in a
dream, which is why--

00:33:35.350 --> 00:33:37.750 align:middle line:84%
I think the Course
does a brilliant job

00:33:37.750 --> 00:33:41.390 align:middle line:84%
of saying that this is
not just an illusion.

00:33:41.390 --> 00:33:44.440 align:middle line:84%
This is a dream that
you can awaken from.

00:33:44.440 --> 00:33:49.000 align:middle line:84%
And when Buddha said
I am awake, that's

00:33:49.000 --> 00:33:50.350 align:middle line:90%
what he was talking about.

00:33:50.350 --> 00:33:54.050 align:middle line:84%
Nowadays, people, they
think when Buddha said,

00:33:54.050 --> 00:33:56.740 align:middle line:84%
oh, I'm awake,
they think that he

00:33:56.740 --> 00:33:59.260 align:middle line:84%
meant that he was amazingly
alert and ready to manifest

00:33:59.260 --> 00:34:00.902 align:middle line:84%
like hell or
something like that.

00:34:00.902 --> 00:34:02.110 align:middle line:90%
But that's not what he meant.

00:34:02.110 --> 00:34:03.693 align:middle line:84%
What he meant was
that he had awakened

00:34:03.693 --> 00:34:05.560 align:middle line:84%
from the entire dream
of time and space

00:34:05.560 --> 00:34:09.190 align:middle line:84%
and realized that he
was not the dream,

00:34:09.190 --> 00:34:12.659 align:middle line:84%
that he was not in the dream,
that he was the dreamer who

00:34:12.659 --> 00:34:16.510 align:middle line:84%
was projecting this whole thing,
that the whole universe of time

00:34:16.510 --> 00:34:19.000 align:middle line:90%
and space was coming from him.

00:34:19.000 --> 00:34:23.350 align:middle line:84%
And when he realized that,
that is enlightenment

00:34:23.350 --> 00:34:26.239 align:middle line:84%
because enlightenment
is awakening.

00:34:26.239 --> 00:34:28.090 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:34:28.090 --> 00:34:30.639 align:middle line:84%
So this thing you
just brought up,

00:34:30.639 --> 00:34:34.600 align:middle line:84%
this is one of the most
common New Age beliefs,

00:34:34.600 --> 00:34:41.170 align:middle line:84%
that God created heaven and hell
and this dual-natured universe,

00:34:41.170 --> 00:34:46.270 align:middle line:84%
or universes, so that he
could experience himself

00:34:46.270 --> 00:34:47.739 align:middle line:84%
through this
contrast which never

00:34:47.739 --> 00:34:50.010 align:middle line:90%
made any sense to me at all.

00:34:50.010 --> 00:34:51.670 align:middle line:90%
That just has never resonated.

00:34:51.670 --> 00:34:52.920 align:middle line:90%
>>RENARD: Yeah.

00:34:52.920 --> 00:34:55.980 align:middle line:84%
Well, I don't want to
rain on anybody's parade.

00:34:55.980 --> 00:35:03.563 align:middle line:84%
But to think that God made
this is an insult to God.

00:35:03.563 --> 00:35:05.230 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Well that's
one way to put it.

00:35:05.230 --> 00:35:08.490 align:middle line:90%
I just do not resonate at all.

00:35:08.490 --> 00:35:12.970 align:middle line:84%
I have never been able to feel
any truth in that statement.

00:35:12.970 --> 00:35:16.340 align:middle line:84%
>>RENARD: So let's say that
God really is perfect love

00:35:16.340 --> 00:35:21.540 align:middle line:84%
and that there was just a
thought because we are not

00:35:21.540 --> 00:35:23.190 align:middle line:90%
in prison.

00:35:23.190 --> 00:35:26.130 align:middle line:84%
Heaven is not a prison,
so there was just

00:35:26.130 --> 00:35:28.440 align:middle line:84%
a thought for a
second that turned out

00:35:28.440 --> 00:35:30.760 align:middle line:90%
to be a stupid thought.

00:35:30.760 --> 00:35:33.350 align:middle line:90%
What could I be different?

00:35:33.350 --> 00:35:34.510 align:middle line:90%
What could I do different?

00:35:34.510 --> 00:35:38.250 align:middle line:84%
What could I say that
was different than heaven

00:35:38.250 --> 00:35:41.547 align:middle line:84%
and was so stupid it
was over in an instant?

00:35:41.547 --> 00:35:43.380 align:middle line:84%
And "A Course in Miracles"
says that it only

00:35:43.380 --> 00:35:44.575 align:middle line:90%
lasted for an instant.

00:35:44.575 --> 00:35:46.950 align:middle line:84%
And then say it's saying it
didn't last at all because it

00:35:46.950 --> 00:35:52.500 align:middle line:84%
was just a dream, and dreams
may appear to be true,

00:35:52.500 --> 00:35:54.730 align:middle line:90%
but they're not really true.

00:35:54.730 --> 00:35:56.580 align:middle line:90%
So it was over instantly.

00:35:56.580 --> 00:36:01.800 align:middle line:84%
And God is still perfect,
and he would not do this.

00:36:01.800 --> 00:36:03.270 align:middle line:84%
The way "A Course
in Miracles" puts

00:36:03.270 --> 00:36:06.900 align:middle line:84%
it is that no
father could subject

00:36:06.900 --> 00:36:13.703 align:middle line:84%
his children to this as the
cost of salvation and be loving.

00:36:13.703 --> 00:36:15.370 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Yeah, I
would agree with that.

00:36:15.370 --> 00:36:17.455 align:middle line:84%
>>RENARD: So if God is
really perfect love--

00:36:17.455 --> 00:36:19.580 align:middle line:84%
and I appreciate the fact
that you agree with that,

00:36:19.580 --> 00:36:21.520 align:middle line:84%
but there are a lot of
people who are upset.

00:36:21.520 --> 00:36:23.187 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Maybe people
even hearing this

00:36:23.187 --> 00:36:24.820 align:middle line:84%
now will not be
comfortable with that,

00:36:24.820 --> 00:36:26.350 align:middle line:90%
but I'm simply being truthful.

00:36:26.350 --> 00:36:29.710 align:middle line:84%
I have never resonated with
that as a higher truth.

00:36:29.710 --> 00:36:31.270 align:middle line:84%
And the thing about
freeing oneself

00:36:31.270 --> 00:36:36.400 align:middle line:84%
from really the solid aspect of
all of the different elements

00:36:36.400 --> 00:36:38.770 align:middle line:84%
of our emotions and
everything we're attached to

00:36:38.770 --> 00:36:42.010 align:middle line:84%
is that it actually
can become, as it

00:36:42.010 --> 00:36:45.040 align:middle line:84%
did for Buckminster Fuller
after all the suffering,

00:36:45.040 --> 00:36:46.580 align:middle line:90%
a grand experiment.

00:36:46.580 --> 00:36:47.380 align:middle line:90%
What's to lose?

00:36:47.380 --> 00:36:48.580 align:middle line:90%
>>RENARD: I remember Bucky, yes.

00:36:48.580 --> 00:36:50.122 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Yeah,
what's to lose if you

00:36:50.122 --> 00:36:52.330 align:middle line:84%
do see life as a
genuine experiment,

00:36:52.330 --> 00:36:58.000 align:middle line:84%
always trying to move higher
and higher in terms of the more

00:36:58.000 --> 00:37:00.250 align:middle line:90%
refined virtues in life.

00:37:00.250 --> 00:37:03.640 align:middle line:84%
That's the only worthwhile
quest that I can think of,

00:37:03.640 --> 00:37:06.730 align:middle line:84%
just like you said earlier
with one of these incarnations,

00:37:06.730 --> 00:37:10.280 align:middle line:84%
where they had to overcome
a certain kind of jealousy,

00:37:10.280 --> 00:37:11.080 align:middle line:90%
or desire.

00:37:11.080 --> 00:37:13.600 align:middle line:84%
In the next one we're
going into, hey, it

00:37:13.600 --> 00:37:16.810 align:middle line:84%
looks like we have drinking,
gambling, and flirting even.

00:37:16.810 --> 00:37:18.740 align:middle line:84%
OK, this was the
Jesus character.

00:37:18.740 --> 00:37:21.340 align:middle line:90%
So now we're talking 2500 BC.

00:37:21.340 --> 00:37:22.750 align:middle line:90%
This is a Hindu life.

00:37:22.750 --> 00:37:24.580 align:middle line:90%
Harish is Jesus.

00:37:24.580 --> 00:37:26.740 align:middle line:90%
Padmaj is Buddha.

00:37:26.740 --> 00:37:29.920 align:middle line:84%
And they're cousins
and devout Hindus.

00:37:29.920 --> 00:37:33.270 align:middle line:84%
And Harish had desires, like
drinking, gambling, flirting.

00:37:33.270 --> 00:37:34.870 align:middle line:90%
OK, there's your duality.

00:37:34.870 --> 00:37:37.780 align:middle line:84%
Let's try it on for
size as an experiment.

00:37:37.780 --> 00:37:39.430 align:middle line:84%
What did they learn
out of this one?

00:37:39.430 --> 00:37:41.830 align:middle line:84%
He ended up dragging
Buddha into trouble.

00:37:41.830 --> 00:37:43.650 align:middle line:84%
>>RENARD: Boy, he
reminds me of me.

00:37:43.650 --> 00:37:44.530 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: [CHUCKLES]

00:37:44.530 --> 00:37:46.510 align:middle line:84%
>>RENARD: Yeah,
well, they really

00:37:46.510 --> 00:37:50.470 align:middle line:84%
ran the gamut in that
life because they

00:37:50.470 --> 00:37:56.510 align:middle line:84%
experience all the kinds of
temptations that we all do.

00:37:56.510 --> 00:37:59.320 align:middle line:84%
And I think at the
end of that lifetime,

00:37:59.320 --> 00:38:01.840 align:middle line:84%
they came to a conclusion
which could also

00:38:01.840 --> 00:38:06.130 align:middle line:84%
be quoted from "A
Course in Miracles,"

00:38:06.130 --> 00:38:09.940 align:middle line:84%
if there is a definition of
temptation in the Course,

00:38:09.940 --> 00:38:13.030 align:middle line:84%
it says temptation has one
lesson it would teach in all

00:38:13.030 --> 00:38:16.210 align:middle line:90%
its forms wherever it occurs.

00:38:16.210 --> 00:38:19.400 align:middle line:84%
It would persuade the holy
son of God he is a body.

00:38:19.400 --> 00:38:20.200 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:38:20.200 --> 00:38:21.410 align:middle line:90%
Yeah, you said that earlier.

00:38:21.410 --> 00:38:22.210 align:middle line:90%
Exactly.

00:38:22.210 --> 00:38:25.360 align:middle line:84%
So they're having to contend
with this notion of trying

00:38:25.360 --> 00:38:27.700 align:middle line:84%
to be persuaded that
this is their reality.

00:38:27.700 --> 00:38:31.670 align:middle line:84%
>>RENARD: So they are being
tempted to think that they are

00:38:31.670 --> 00:38:32.470 align:middle line:90%
bodies--

00:38:32.470 --> 00:38:33.595 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: This is it, yeah.

00:38:33.595 --> 00:38:35.770 align:middle line:84%
>>RENARD: --and that
that is their reality,

00:38:35.770 --> 00:38:38.670 align:middle line:90%
and they are experiencing it.

00:38:38.670 --> 00:38:44.440 align:middle line:84%
And it really was very hard
for them to get over that.

00:38:44.440 --> 00:38:46.200 align:middle line:84%
But what really
turned them around

00:38:46.200 --> 00:38:49.140 align:middle line:84%
was when they got into an
argument, and one of them

00:38:49.140 --> 00:38:52.560 align:middle line:84%
got stabbed, and the
other one realized--

00:38:52.560 --> 00:38:54.460 align:middle line:90%
what am I doing?

00:38:54.460 --> 00:38:56.280 align:middle line:90%
What am I doing here?

00:38:56.280 --> 00:39:00.750 align:middle line:84%
What I am doing and thinking
is leading to destruction

00:39:00.750 --> 00:39:03.000 align:middle line:84%
instead of what it should
be leading to, which

00:39:03.000 --> 00:39:08.520 align:middle line:84%
is life and peace and the kinds
of things that I really want.

00:39:08.520 --> 00:39:10.687 align:middle line:84%
And there was a major
lesson for them.

00:39:10.687 --> 00:39:12.270 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And then
as I understand it,

00:39:12.270 --> 00:39:15.060 align:middle line:84%
they each did end
up as true mystics

00:39:15.060 --> 00:39:17.280 align:middle line:84%
in that lifetime, which
kind of always ended up

00:39:17.280 --> 00:39:19.740 align:middle line:84%
where they were finding
the higher aspect of self

00:39:19.740 --> 00:39:22.200 align:middle line:84%
anyway and just playing
with all these notions

00:39:22.200 --> 00:39:26.730 align:middle line:84%
in these various incarnations,
trying it on for size, applying

00:39:26.730 --> 00:39:29.340 align:middle line:90%
some of their higher thinking.

00:39:29.340 --> 00:39:32.160 align:middle line:84%
>>RENARD: Absolutely, and
that's a microcosm for our lives

00:39:32.160 --> 00:39:37.480 align:middle line:84%
because sometimes we can start
off not being the best people.

00:39:37.480 --> 00:39:39.300 align:middle line:84%
I certainly wasn't
the best person

00:39:39.300 --> 00:39:40.630 align:middle line:90%
if you look at my life history.

00:39:40.630 --> 00:39:44.370 align:middle line:84%
But as you go
along, sometimes you

00:39:44.370 --> 00:39:48.810 align:middle line:84%
can actually grow and change
and become a totally different

00:39:48.810 --> 00:39:52.140 align:middle line:84%
person than you were
when you were younger.

00:39:52.140 --> 00:39:54.425 align:middle line:84%
And that's what happened
with them in that lifetime.

00:39:54.425 --> 00:39:55.800 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And then
they went on--

00:39:55.800 --> 00:39:59.880 align:middle line:84%
Jesus, Mary Magdalene-- and
you say in that lifetime that

00:39:59.880 --> 00:40:04.710 align:middle line:84%
Pursah told you that they
did travel to India together

00:40:04.710 --> 00:40:07.230 align:middle line:84%
because, again,
everyone's speculation--

00:40:07.230 --> 00:40:09.870 align:middle line:84%
I interviewed someone who did
a documentary on Jesus's time

00:40:09.870 --> 00:40:10.670 align:middle line:90%
in India.

00:40:10.670 --> 00:40:13.860 align:middle line:84%
And so what was their
story about what

00:40:13.860 --> 00:40:15.840 align:middle line:84%
they did once they
were together,

00:40:15.840 --> 00:40:17.410 align:middle line:90%
where their travels took them?

00:40:17.410 --> 00:40:18.210 align:middle line:90%
They were young.

00:40:18.210 --> 00:40:19.085 align:middle line:90%
>>RENARD: Well, yeah.

00:40:19.085 --> 00:40:20.220 align:middle line:90%
They first met as children.

00:40:20.220 --> 00:40:21.330 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:40:21.330 --> 00:40:26.670 align:middle line:84%
>>RENARD: And they were fond
of each other, you know.

00:40:26.670 --> 00:40:31.217 align:middle line:84%
And when they got a little bit
older, in their teen years,

00:40:31.217 --> 00:40:33.300 align:middle line:84%
they found that they were
in love with each other.

00:40:33.300 --> 00:40:35.130 align:middle line:84%
And they had a
normal relationship.

00:40:35.130 --> 00:40:37.350 align:middle line:90%
They had a sexual relationship.

00:40:37.350 --> 00:40:41.610 align:middle line:84%
But as time went
on, they both knew

00:40:41.610 --> 00:40:44.100 align:middle line:84%
that the body was
not their reality

00:40:44.100 --> 00:40:47.790 align:middle line:84%
and that their reality was
this perfect oneness with God.

00:40:47.790 --> 00:40:51.570 align:middle line:84%
By that point in time,
they realized the truth,

00:40:51.570 --> 00:40:53.640 align:middle line:90%
and they realized--

00:40:53.640 --> 00:40:57.520 align:middle line:84%
Buddhists would also say
the truth is a constant.

00:40:57.520 --> 00:40:59.850 align:middle line:84%
The truth is not
something that changes.

00:40:59.850 --> 00:41:03.150 align:middle line:84%
Jesus used a metaphor about
building a house upon the rock

00:41:03.150 --> 00:41:05.190 align:middle line:90%
instead of the sand.

00:41:05.190 --> 00:41:08.280 align:middle line:84%
This world that we
appear to be living in

00:41:08.280 --> 00:41:10.500 align:middle line:90%
is very much the sand.

00:41:10.500 --> 00:41:12.030 align:middle line:90%
I mean, I live in LA.

00:41:12.030 --> 00:41:15.360 align:middle line:84%
Who knows what earthquake
could come along any minute.

00:41:15.360 --> 00:41:18.720 align:middle line:84%
That's building your house
upon the sand literally.

00:41:18.720 --> 00:41:24.540 align:middle line:84%
And at the same time, the
rock is symbolic of something

00:41:24.540 --> 00:41:26.080 align:middle line:90%
that doesn't shift or change.

00:41:26.080 --> 00:41:29.810 align:middle line:84%
It's something that you
can actually depend upon,

00:41:29.810 --> 00:41:32.720 align:middle line:84%
and that's what
they came to learn.

00:41:32.720 --> 00:41:38.362 align:middle line:84%
And they said, OK, it's
like this is something

00:41:38.362 --> 00:41:40.070 align:middle line:84%
that even though we
love each other, even

00:41:40.070 --> 00:41:42.830 align:middle line:84%
though we have this
wonderful relationship,

00:41:42.830 --> 00:41:44.210 align:middle line:90%
we know the truth.

00:41:44.210 --> 00:41:47.790 align:middle line:84%
So what they would do is
every now and then when

00:41:47.790 --> 00:41:50.540 align:middle line:84%
they were in this
moment of passion,

00:41:50.540 --> 00:41:56.010 align:middle line:84%
they would say, OK, by the
way, I know who you really are,

00:41:56.010 --> 00:41:58.090 align:middle line:84%
and they would
overlook the body.

00:41:58.090 --> 00:42:01.240 align:middle line:84%
And that's an essential
part of forgiveness.

00:42:01.240 --> 00:42:04.060 align:middle line:84%
You overlook the body
instead of making it real.

00:42:04.060 --> 00:42:08.440 align:middle line:84%
And you look to the
constancy that shines just

00:42:08.440 --> 00:42:14.360 align:middle line:84%
beyond the body, something that
is real and will never change.

00:42:14.360 --> 00:42:16.480 align:middle line:84%
And if you think of
that person that way,

00:42:16.480 --> 00:42:18.685 align:middle line:84%
according to the
chorus, you can't help

00:42:18.685 --> 00:42:20.560 align:middle line:84%
but think of yourself
that way because that's

00:42:20.560 --> 00:42:21.727 align:middle line:90%
the way that the mind works.

00:42:21.727 --> 00:42:23.220 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right, right, right.

00:42:23.220 --> 00:42:26.710 align:middle line:84%
OK, so being able to
see beyond, to have

00:42:26.710 --> 00:42:28.300 align:middle line:84%
a kind of unique
passion where they

00:42:28.300 --> 00:42:31.660 align:middle line:84%
were going more or
less soul to soul,

00:42:31.660 --> 00:42:33.610 align:middle line:84%
and so they had
learned these lessons.

00:42:33.610 --> 00:42:37.090 align:middle line:84%
They also had a time when they
were two males, in Greece,

00:42:37.090 --> 00:42:40.750 align:middle line:84%
in Athens, more in a
philosophical school.

00:42:40.750 --> 00:42:43.930 align:middle line:84%
And so all of this,
I mean, to me,

00:42:43.930 --> 00:42:45.460 align:middle line:84%
what I found
interesting about it

00:42:45.460 --> 00:42:49.960 align:middle line:84%
is the different ways in which
we choose to learn our lessons

00:42:49.960 --> 00:42:52.300 align:middle line:84%
or what appeared to be
lessons of this world--

00:42:52.300 --> 00:42:55.900 align:middle line:84%
again, always finding your
way back to that one place.

00:42:55.900 --> 00:43:01.360 align:middle line:84%
And so, with that said, what
was the big overarching message

00:43:01.360 --> 00:43:05.320 align:middle line:84%
to you in having been
given this information

00:43:05.320 --> 00:43:08.160 align:middle line:90%
and having written this book?

00:43:08.160 --> 00:43:10.050 align:middle line:84%
>>RENARD: Well,
first of all, when

00:43:10.050 --> 00:43:12.420 align:middle line:84%
it comes to the
time of Plato, this

00:43:12.420 --> 00:43:14.700 align:middle line:84%
is a time when Jesus
and Buddha actually

00:43:14.700 --> 00:43:16.830 align:middle line:84%
discovered that they
were ahead of the curve,

00:43:16.830 --> 00:43:20.410 align:middle line:84%
that they were actually
ahead of Plato.

00:43:20.410 --> 00:43:21.210 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:43:21.210 --> 00:43:23.880 align:middle line:84%
>>RENARD: And they were
saying he's brilliant and he

00:43:23.880 --> 00:43:25.630 align:middle line:90%
understands the one--

00:43:25.630 --> 00:43:29.770 align:middle line:84%
and Platonists actually
articulated the one even more--

00:43:29.770 --> 00:43:33.880 align:middle line:84%
but it's like, yeah,
this guy is great,

00:43:33.880 --> 00:43:36.690 align:middle line:84%
but there is
something that we are

00:43:36.690 --> 00:43:39.850 align:middle line:90%
suspecting that is the truth.

00:43:39.850 --> 00:43:43.020 align:middle line:84%
And the truth is
not just the one.

00:43:43.020 --> 00:43:45.510 align:middle line:90%
The truth is perfect oneness.

00:43:45.510 --> 00:43:50.430 align:middle line:84%
Because Plato was still kind
of like hinting at duality,

00:43:50.430 --> 00:43:52.740 align:middle line:84%
and Jesus and Buddha were
thinking-- at that time,

00:43:52.740 --> 00:43:54.810 align:middle line:84%
they were starting
to get the idea is

00:43:54.810 --> 00:43:56.830 align:middle line:90%
that you can't compromise.

00:43:56.830 --> 00:43:59.580 align:middle line:84%
And this is what I love about
my teachers Arten and Pursah.

00:43:59.580 --> 00:44:07.050 align:middle line:84%
They never compromise on the
fact that only God is real,

00:44:07.050 --> 00:44:08.580 align:middle line:90%
and nothing else is real.

00:44:08.580 --> 00:44:10.720 align:middle line:90%
Nothing else is true.

00:44:10.720 --> 00:44:15.630 align:middle line:84%
And if you make something else
true, and if you believe in it,

00:44:15.630 --> 00:44:18.090 align:middle line:90%
that is what will affect you.

00:44:18.090 --> 00:44:22.050 align:middle line:84%
So the way that the Course
puts it about forgiveness,

00:44:22.050 --> 00:44:24.450 align:middle line:84%
it denies the ability
of anything not of God

00:44:24.450 --> 00:44:26.600 align:middle line:90%
to affect you.

00:44:26.600 --> 00:44:30.230 align:middle line:84%
If you believe in this
world, it will affect you,

00:44:30.230 --> 00:44:32.090 align:middle line:90%
and it will hurt you.

00:44:32.090 --> 00:44:34.190 align:middle line:84%
But Jesus got to the
point, and Buddha

00:44:34.190 --> 00:44:38.160 align:middle line:84%
got to the point, where this
world could not hurt them,

00:44:38.160 --> 00:44:40.010 align:middle line:90%
and it could not affect them.

00:44:40.010 --> 00:44:43.340 align:middle line:84%
Because of the power of the
mind and the power of belief,

00:44:43.340 --> 00:44:47.590 align:middle line:84%
you can get to the point where
your ego is completely undone.

00:44:47.590 --> 00:44:50.210 align:middle line:84%
And Jesus, in "A Course in
Miracles," makes it very clear

00:44:50.210 --> 00:44:53.030 align:middle line:84%
that at the end of his life,
it was impossible for him

00:44:53.030 --> 00:44:57.440 align:middle line:84%
to feel any physical
pain because he did not

00:44:57.440 --> 00:44:59.990 align:middle line:84%
have any guilt in his
mind, because his mind had

00:44:59.990 --> 00:45:03.410 align:middle line:84%
been completely healed
by the Holy Spirit.

00:45:03.410 --> 00:45:06.530 align:middle line:84%
And that is the destiny that
is held out to you and to me

00:45:06.530 --> 00:45:07.400 align:middle line:90%
and to everybody.

00:45:07.400 --> 00:45:10.580 align:middle line:84%
That is what is going to
be the eventual stopping

00:45:10.580 --> 00:45:12.650 align:middle line:90%
point for every one of us.

00:45:12.650 --> 00:45:15.110 align:middle line:84%
We are going to get to
the point where we will

00:45:15.110 --> 00:45:18.260 align:middle line:90%
be like Jesus and like Buddha.

00:45:18.260 --> 00:45:22.170 align:middle line:84%
And when I first heard that in
the Course, it was like, oh,

00:45:22.170 --> 00:45:22.970 align:middle line:90%
really?

00:45:22.970 --> 00:45:24.140 align:middle line:90%
I'm going to be like Jesus?

00:45:24.140 --> 00:45:25.863 align:middle line:90%
Well, he promises it.

00:45:25.863 --> 00:45:27.530 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Yes, and
in the ancient texts,

00:45:27.530 --> 00:45:29.530 align:middle line:90%
they said as much.

00:45:29.530 --> 00:45:30.760 align:middle line:90%
>>RENARD: Yes.

00:45:30.760 --> 00:45:33.340 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: We just have to
develop a little humility

00:45:33.340 --> 00:45:35.500 align:middle line:84%
to know that our own
conscious thoughts might not

00:45:35.500 --> 00:45:36.618 align:middle line:90%
be the be all and end all.

00:45:36.618 --> 00:45:38.785 align:middle line:10%
>>RENARD: One of my favorite
quotes from the Courses

00:45:38.785 --> 00:45:44.140 align:middle line:10%
is, "Be humble before
God but be great in him."

00:45:44.140 --> 00:45:46.660 align:middle line:10%
>>REGINA: That was pretty much
a perfect ending there, Gary,

00:45:46.660 --> 00:45:49.300 align:middle line:10%
so I want to thank you so
much for taking the time

00:45:49.300 --> 00:45:52.790 align:middle line:10%
and to be with us and share some
of this very beautiful wisdom

00:45:52.790 --> 00:45:53.590 align:middle line:10%
with us.

00:45:53.590 --> 00:45:56.060 align:middle line:10%
I appreciate that.
