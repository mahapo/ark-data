[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:00:09.430 --> 00:00:11.650 align:middle line:84%
>>MICHAEL JAWER: So
way back in the 1990s,

00:00:11.650 --> 00:00:13.990 align:middle line:84%
I was working in the commercial
real estate industry.

00:00:13.990 --> 00:00:14.500 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA MEREDITH:
Well that sounds

00:00:14.500 --> 00:00:16.667 align:middle line:84%
like a natural segue to the
"Sensitive Soul" author.

00:00:16.667 --> 00:00:17.467 align:middle line:90%
>>JAWER: Sure.

00:00:17.467 --> 00:00:19.925 align:middle line:84%
A feeling went up the spine
like this is just not ordinary.

00:00:19.925 --> 00:00:21.050 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Not normal, yeah.

00:00:21.050 --> 00:00:22.330 align:middle line:90%
>>JAWER: But it is very human.

00:00:22.330 --> 00:00:24.573 align:middle line:84%
One example might actually
be Greta Thunberg.

00:00:24.573 --> 00:00:25.990 align:middle line:84%
She went into this
depression then

00:00:25.990 --> 00:00:27.580 align:middle line:90%
she came out this crusader.

00:00:27.580 --> 00:00:29.290 align:middle line:84%
So that these kinds
of experiences,

00:00:29.290 --> 00:00:31.660 align:middle line:84%
which are traumatic,
have a resonance to them.

00:00:31.660 --> 00:00:33.118 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: I mean
with someone who's

00:00:33.118 --> 00:00:35.830 align:middle line:84%
five to give a 20-minute
discourse on the nature of God

00:00:35.830 --> 00:00:38.290 align:middle line:84%
and man, it would certainly
seem it's not coming

00:00:38.290 --> 00:00:40.180 align:middle line:90%
from his personal experience.

00:00:40.180 --> 00:00:42.700 align:middle line:84%
>>JAWER: They are dissociating
from their own day-to-day

00:00:42.700 --> 00:00:43.300 align:middle line:90%
experience.

00:00:43.300 --> 00:00:45.133 align:middle line:84%
And the question is
what are they accessing?

00:00:45.133 --> 00:00:48.940 align:middle line:90%


00:00:48.940 --> 00:00:50.620 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Today's
guest, Michael Jawer,

00:00:50.620 --> 00:00:52.660 align:middle line:84%
is saying some of us
are more thin-walled

00:00:52.660 --> 00:00:54.280 align:middle line:90%
and others more thick-walled.

00:00:54.280 --> 00:00:55.550 align:middle line:90%
What does this mean?

00:00:55.550 --> 00:00:58.250 align:middle line:84%
It means that we have different
levels of sensitivity,

00:00:58.250 --> 00:01:00.130 align:middle line:84%
which has implications
for each one of us.

00:01:00.130 --> 00:01:02.170 align:middle line:84%
For example a
thin-walled person might

00:01:02.170 --> 00:01:06.040 align:middle line:84%
be overly sensitive to pretty
much everything emotionally.

00:01:06.040 --> 00:01:09.247 align:middle line:84%
But it may be opened up on
more sublime connection levels.

00:01:09.247 --> 00:01:11.830 align:middle line:84%
And that's kind of where we're
going to go in the conversation

00:01:11.830 --> 00:01:13.000 align:middle line:90%
is everywhere in between.

00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:14.197 align:middle line:90%
Welcome, Michael.

00:01:14.197 --> 00:01:16.030 align:middle line:84%
>>JAWER: It's a pleasure
to be here, Regina.

00:01:16.030 --> 00:01:17.650 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And the book's
called "Sensitive Soul."

00:01:17.650 --> 00:01:18.450 align:middle line:90%
>>JAWER: Yes.

00:01:18.450 --> 00:01:20.770 align:middle line:10%
>>REGINA: And so we're
going to spend a lot of time

00:01:20.770 --> 00:01:23.530 align:middle line:10%
on anecdotes because the
book is loaded with them

00:01:23.530 --> 00:01:25.450 align:middle line:10%
and people love anecdotes.

00:01:25.450 --> 00:01:27.292 align:middle line:10%
So before we go there,
let's first of all,

00:01:27.292 --> 00:01:28.750 align:middle line:10%
let everybody get
to know you a bit

00:01:28.750 --> 00:01:31.930 align:middle line:10%
and let them get to know you a
bit in terms of your background

00:01:31.930 --> 00:01:35.200 align:middle line:10%
in terms of both psychological
and paranormal research,

00:01:35.200 --> 00:01:36.950 align:middle line:10%
so they'll know where
you're coming from.

00:01:36.950 --> 00:01:37.750 align:middle line:90%
>>JAWER: Sure.

00:01:37.750 --> 00:01:40.360 align:middle line:84%
Well I never really expected
to delve into the subject

00:01:40.360 --> 00:01:42.610 align:middle line:84%
that we're going to be talking
about, but going back--

00:01:42.610 --> 00:01:43.985 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Well
how did it happen?

00:01:43.985 --> 00:01:47.140 align:middle line:10%
>>JAWER: So about 25 years
ago, way back in the 1990s,

00:01:47.140 --> 00:01:49.840 align:middle line:10%
I was actually working in the
commercial real estate industry

00:01:49.840 --> 00:01:52.330 align:middle line:10%
representing a commercial
building owners and managers--

00:01:52.330 --> 00:01:54.288 align:middle line:10%
>>REGINA: Well that sounds
like a natural segue

00:01:54.288 --> 00:01:56.678 align:middle line:10%
to the "Sensitive Soul" author.

00:01:56.678 --> 00:01:57.970 align:middle line:90%
>>JAWER: Well it's interesting.

00:01:57.970 --> 00:02:00.250 align:middle line:84%
There is a straight
line going back.

00:02:00.250 --> 00:02:02.440 align:middle line:10%
So I was representing
this organization

00:02:02.440 --> 00:02:04.630 align:middle line:10%
and working with the
Environmental Protection

00:02:04.630 --> 00:02:07.120 align:middle line:10%
Agency, because there's
something called sick building

00:02:07.120 --> 00:02:09.130 align:middle line:10%
syndrome that occasionally
people read about.

00:02:09.130 --> 00:02:13.240 align:middle line:84%
And it's when a building becomes
unhealthy for people to be in

00:02:13.240 --> 00:02:16.120 align:middle line:84%
or, at the very least, there's
certain people in the building

00:02:16.120 --> 00:02:19.120 align:middle line:84%
that don't work in the
building very well because they

00:02:19.120 --> 00:02:19.960 align:middle line:90%
feel sick.

00:02:19.960 --> 00:02:21.460 align:middle line:84%
And then they go
out of the building

00:02:21.460 --> 00:02:22.670 align:middle line:90%
and they feel much better.

00:02:22.670 --> 00:02:25.240 align:middle line:84%
So the question is how do you
prevent sick building syndrome?

00:02:25.240 --> 00:02:27.730 align:middle line:84%
And how do you assist
the property managers

00:02:27.730 --> 00:02:32.085 align:middle line:84%
and the engineers to take care
of it if problems do arise?

00:02:32.085 --> 00:02:33.460 align:middle line:84%
And that's what
I was working on.

00:02:33.460 --> 00:02:36.520 align:middle line:84%
And in researching this
and in developing guidance

00:02:36.520 --> 00:02:39.543 align:middle line:84%
that the building owners and
managers could put to use,

00:02:39.543 --> 00:02:40.960 align:middle line:84%
I was talking to
people who'd been

00:02:40.960 --> 00:02:44.680 align:middle line:84%
affected by poor indoor air
and so-called sick buildings.

00:02:44.680 --> 00:02:48.580 align:middle line:84%
And some of them
related to me that they

00:02:48.580 --> 00:02:51.130 align:middle line:84%
had been super
sensitive to things

00:02:51.130 --> 00:02:53.230 align:middle line:84%
preceding this
particular environment

00:02:53.230 --> 00:02:54.550 align:middle line:90%
situation in the building.

00:02:54.550 --> 00:02:58.570 align:middle line:84%
And some of them said they
were sensitive to electricity,

00:02:58.570 --> 00:03:00.250 align:middle line:90%
to smells.

00:03:00.250 --> 00:03:03.850 align:middle line:84%
And some said that they
had anomalous or paranormal

00:03:03.850 --> 00:03:05.440 align:middle line:90%
sensitivities.

00:03:05.440 --> 00:03:07.000 align:middle line:84%
I never thought,
Regina, that I would

00:03:07.000 --> 00:03:09.310 align:middle line:84%
be hearing this kind of
information from folks.

00:03:09.310 --> 00:03:14.950 align:middle line:84%
But I'm grateful because I think
they confided in me as they

00:03:14.950 --> 00:03:17.650 align:middle line:84%
understood that this was a
project to try to improve

00:03:17.650 --> 00:03:19.660 align:middle line:90%
the environment of buildings.

00:03:19.660 --> 00:03:21.700 align:middle line:84%
And we got to
talking and I began

00:03:21.700 --> 00:03:27.040 align:middle line:84%
to wonder whether
sensitivity as a phenomenon

00:03:27.040 --> 00:03:29.590 align:middle line:84%
is just different
for different people.

00:03:29.590 --> 00:03:31.990 align:middle line:84%
That certain people
are more sensitive

00:03:31.990 --> 00:03:35.380 align:middle line:84%
for various and sundry reasons
in any particular situation.

00:03:35.380 --> 00:03:37.720 align:middle line:84%
And a so-called
sick building just

00:03:37.720 --> 00:03:40.060 align:middle line:84%
sort of prompts them
in a particular way

00:03:40.060 --> 00:03:43.160 align:middle line:84%
and becomes a manifest
difficulty for them.

00:03:43.160 --> 00:03:44.830 align:middle line:84%
So that's really what
drew me into this.

00:03:44.830 --> 00:03:49.630 align:middle line:84%
And I had a preexisting
interest in anomalous phenomena.

00:03:49.630 --> 00:03:51.610 align:middle line:84%
I'd had a couple of
experiences myself.

00:03:51.610 --> 00:03:53.350 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: I want to hear about
this before we go too far.

00:03:53.350 --> 00:03:54.150 align:middle line:90%
>>JAWER: Sure.

00:03:54.150 --> 00:03:56.080 align:middle line:84%
And within my family,
there's sort of lore,

00:03:56.080 --> 00:03:58.600 align:middle line:84%
especially on my mom's
side of the family,

00:03:58.600 --> 00:04:00.980 align:middle line:84%
of some psychical
abilities maybe

00:04:00.980 --> 00:04:02.570 align:middle line:90%
or just incidents that happened.

00:04:02.570 --> 00:04:04.720 align:middle line:84%
So I've always had kind of
a side interest in this.

00:04:04.720 --> 00:04:08.360 align:middle line:84%
So when folks confided
in me, I thought, well,

00:04:08.360 --> 00:04:09.680 align:middle line:90%
this is interesting.

00:04:09.680 --> 00:04:11.890 align:middle line:84%
Maybe I can explore
this a little further

00:04:11.890 --> 00:04:13.100 align:middle line:90%
and see what happens.

00:04:13.100 --> 00:04:16.850 align:middle line:84%
So since then, the
past 25 years or so,

00:04:16.850 --> 00:04:20.770 align:middle line:84%
I've been conducting sort of my
own independent investigation

00:04:20.770 --> 00:04:22.270 align:middle line:84%
talking to lots of
different people,

00:04:22.270 --> 00:04:26.560 align:middle line:84%
conducting a wide ranging
survey into a different forms

00:04:26.560 --> 00:04:29.050 align:middle line:84%
of sensitivity, and
compiling results,

00:04:29.050 --> 00:04:34.180 align:middle line:84%
and trying to be skeptical along
the way, trying to really hold

00:04:34.180 --> 00:04:36.490 align:middle line:84%
up to scrutiny what
people tell me,

00:04:36.490 --> 00:04:38.560 align:middle line:84%
and try to figure
out sort of nature

00:04:38.560 --> 00:04:40.812 align:middle line:84%
and nurture mix that
accounts for different types

00:04:40.812 --> 00:04:43.270 align:middle line:84%
of sensitivities, including
the extraordinary ones that are

00:04:43.270 --> 00:04:45.080 align:middle line:90%
described in this latest book.

00:04:45.080 --> 00:04:45.880 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:04:45.880 --> 00:04:48.100 align:middle line:84%
And we'll get into all kinds
of possibilities there.

00:04:48.100 --> 00:04:49.660 align:middle line:84%
It's up to each
person to see what

00:04:49.660 --> 00:04:52.150 align:middle line:90%
it is they feel they relate to.

00:04:52.150 --> 00:04:54.790 align:middle line:84%
But first of all, I want to
know about your own experience,

00:04:54.790 --> 00:04:56.230 align:middle line:90%
anomalous experiences.

00:04:56.230 --> 00:04:57.280 align:middle line:90%
What happened?

00:04:57.280 --> 00:05:01.450 align:middle line:84%
>>JAWER: Well a couple of really
interesting situations, really

00:05:01.450 --> 00:05:02.320 align:middle line:90%
out of left field.

00:05:02.320 --> 00:05:06.430 align:middle line:84%
And I can't say that it's a
recurring theme in my life,

00:05:06.430 --> 00:05:08.260 align:middle line:84%
but just happened
a couple of times

00:05:08.260 --> 00:05:09.710 align:middle line:90%
and gets you to wondering.

00:05:09.710 --> 00:05:13.120 align:middle line:84%
So one example is
after my grandfather

00:05:13.120 --> 00:05:16.120 align:middle line:84%
died, my mom's father, we
had a family gathering.

00:05:16.120 --> 00:05:17.955 align:middle line:84%
It was Thanksgiving
or Passover, I

00:05:17.955 --> 00:05:19.330 align:middle line:84%
don't remember
quite which but it

00:05:19.330 --> 00:05:22.180 align:middle line:84%
was within a few
months of his passing.

00:05:22.180 --> 00:05:25.540 align:middle line:84%
And at the end of the
meal, we were remembering

00:05:25.540 --> 00:05:28.900 align:middle line:84%
people, specifically him, who
weren't at the table that year,

00:05:28.900 --> 00:05:31.730 align:middle line:84%
who had obviously joined
us all previous years.

00:05:31.730 --> 00:05:34.870 align:middle line:84%
And within a few seconds
of mentioning his name,

00:05:34.870 --> 00:05:39.130 align:middle line:84%
there was a knocking
from the wall, maybe

00:05:39.130 --> 00:05:42.910 align:middle line:84%
about six or eight feet away
from where I was sitting.

00:05:42.910 --> 00:05:44.660 align:middle line:84%
And everyone was sitting
around the table.

00:05:44.660 --> 00:05:46.077 align:middle line:84%
The only person
who wasn't sitting

00:05:46.077 --> 00:05:47.690 align:middle line:84%
around the table
at that moment was

00:05:47.690 --> 00:05:49.560 align:middle line:90%
my mom who was in the kitchen.

00:05:49.560 --> 00:05:50.990 align:middle line:90%
So it was anomalous.

00:05:50.990 --> 00:05:52.160 align:middle line:90%
It just came out of nowhere.

00:05:52.160 --> 00:05:55.340 align:middle line:84%
And I remember my cousin
at the time saying,

00:05:55.340 --> 00:05:59.150 align:middle line:84%
after a few seconds of complete
silence, he said, "Wooo."

00:05:59.150 --> 00:06:01.740 align:middle line:84%
And that's basically what you
say in a situation like that.

00:06:01.740 --> 00:06:02.540 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:06:02.540 --> 00:06:04.165 align:middle line:84%
>>JAWER: But that
kind of stuck with me

00:06:04.165 --> 00:06:06.080 align:middle line:90%
because it was just so odd.

00:06:06.080 --> 00:06:09.620 align:middle line:84%
Another example is a number of
years later, I'm in my mid 20s

00:06:09.620 --> 00:06:13.400 align:middle line:84%
at this point, I was
living on my "bachelor

00:06:13.400 --> 00:06:18.620 align:middle line:84%
pad" in suburban D.C.
and my cat was with me.

00:06:18.620 --> 00:06:20.360 align:middle line:90%
We were close companions.

00:06:20.360 --> 00:06:21.860 align:middle line:90%
His name was Dalton.

00:06:21.860 --> 00:06:24.740 align:middle line:84%
And I regarded him as the
George Clooney of cats,

00:06:24.740 --> 00:06:26.550 align:middle line:84%
because he was just
dashing, and debonair,

00:06:26.550 --> 00:06:27.800 align:middle line:90%
and handsome, and intelligent.

00:06:27.800 --> 00:06:31.580 align:middle line:84%
And he wasn't scared
at all of anything.

00:06:31.580 --> 00:06:34.100 align:middle line:84%
One evening, I think it was
a Saturday or Sunday night,

00:06:34.100 --> 00:06:38.020 align:middle line:84%
about 1 o'clock in the morning,
I was just listening to--

00:06:38.020 --> 00:06:39.770 align:middle line:84%
I think I was just
listening to the radio.

00:06:39.770 --> 00:06:43.610 align:middle line:84%
And Dalton was on the bed and
dashed under the bed, which

00:06:43.610 --> 00:06:44.900 align:middle line:90%
he never did.

00:06:44.900 --> 00:06:45.950 align:middle line:90%
Never.

00:06:45.950 --> 00:06:48.350 align:middle line:84%
And moments after he
dashed under the bed--

00:06:48.350 --> 00:06:49.430 align:middle line:90%
I thought that was odd--

00:06:49.430 --> 00:06:53.990 align:middle line:84%
I felt what I can only
describe as a presence,

00:06:53.990 --> 00:06:57.440 align:middle line:84%
again, a few feet away from
me at the foot of the bed.

00:06:57.440 --> 00:06:59.168 align:middle line:90%
And it was palpable.

00:06:59.168 --> 00:07:00.710 align:middle line:84%
And I didn't know
what to make of it.

00:07:00.710 --> 00:07:02.090 align:middle line:90%
It felt uncomfortable.

00:07:02.090 --> 00:07:04.340 align:middle line:84%
I decided to ease
the discomfort.

00:07:04.340 --> 00:07:06.620 align:middle line:84%
I would put my Walkman on
and listen to some music

00:07:06.620 --> 00:07:09.693 align:middle line:84%
and sing along with it
and that calmed me down.

00:07:09.693 --> 00:07:11.360 align:middle line:84%
I looked at the clock,
wondered how long

00:07:11.360 --> 00:07:12.590 align:middle line:90%
is this going to continue.

00:07:12.590 --> 00:07:17.240 align:middle line:84%
At about 1:30, I noticed
that presence had dissipated.

00:07:17.240 --> 00:07:20.520 align:middle line:90%
The feeling was no longer there.

00:07:20.520 --> 00:07:22.340 align:middle line:84%
Out comes Dalton
from under the bed.

00:07:22.340 --> 00:07:23.480 align:middle line:90%
That never happened.

00:07:23.480 --> 00:07:25.370 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Did you
have any sense of who

00:07:25.370 --> 00:07:26.927 align:middle line:90%
the being might have been?

00:07:26.927 --> 00:07:28.760 align:middle line:84%
>>JAWER: I don't know
if it's a who or what.

00:07:28.760 --> 00:07:29.593 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Or a what.

00:07:29.593 --> 00:07:31.470 align:middle line:84%
>>JAWER: I had no,
no, sense other than--

00:07:31.470 --> 00:07:32.470 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Some presence.

00:07:32.470 --> 00:07:35.150 align:middle line:84%
>>JAWER: It was something
that almost felt palpable.

00:07:35.150 --> 00:07:38.930 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So where do you
fall on the sensitivity scale?

00:07:38.930 --> 00:07:41.360 align:middle line:84%
And we're going to talk about
a little self-test in a bit

00:07:41.360 --> 00:07:43.220 align:middle line:84%
that people can
take to kind of see

00:07:43.220 --> 00:07:44.480 align:middle line:90%
where they fall on your scale.

00:07:44.480 --> 00:07:45.485 align:middle line:84%
So where do you
fall on that scale?

00:07:45.485 --> 00:07:47.818 align:middle line:84%
>>JAWER: I'm actually on the
thick side of the spectrum.

00:07:47.818 --> 00:07:51.170 align:middle line:84%
As my wife can tell you,
I'm fairly thick at times.

00:07:51.170 --> 00:07:53.210 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And yet you
are sensitive enough

00:07:53.210 --> 00:07:56.450 align:middle line:84%
that you could feel
this kind of presence.

00:07:56.450 --> 00:07:59.540 align:middle line:84%
>>JAWER: Yes, that seems to
be an aspect of sensitivity.

00:07:59.540 --> 00:08:01.150 align:middle line:90%
And I can say that the--

00:08:01.150 --> 00:08:03.638 align:middle line:84%
we'll talk more about
the boundary concept

00:08:03.638 --> 00:08:05.930 align:middle line:84%
of thick and thin boundaries,
but the guy who developed

00:08:05.930 --> 00:08:08.000 align:middle line:84%
it, Ernest Hartmann,
the late Ernest Hartmann

00:08:08.000 --> 00:08:10.352 align:middle line:90%
from Tufts University.

00:08:10.352 --> 00:08:11.810 align:middle line:84%
The original boundary
questionnaire

00:08:11.810 --> 00:08:16.260 align:middle line:84%
actually has 145 questions and
12 subscales or categories.

00:08:16.260 --> 00:08:17.060 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Oh, yeah.

00:08:17.060 --> 00:08:18.170 align:middle line:90%
Yours is much shorter.

00:08:18.170 --> 00:08:21.110 align:middle line:84%
>>JAWER: Unusual experiences
is one of those 12 categories.

00:08:21.110 --> 00:08:25.610 align:middle line:84%
So it's possible to be
overall thick or overall thin

00:08:25.610 --> 00:08:28.085 align:middle line:84%
but scored differently
in the subcategories.

00:08:28.085 --> 00:08:29.210 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: That makes sense.

00:08:29.210 --> 00:08:29.750 align:middle line:90%
>>JAWER: I'm probably--

00:08:29.750 --> 00:08:31.280 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: I would
have found that, too--

00:08:31.280 --> 00:08:33.140 align:middle line:84%
because my husband and
I both took the test.

00:08:33.140 --> 00:08:35.659 align:middle line:84%
And we were both kind of
surprised at the results

00:08:35.659 --> 00:08:38.117 align:middle line:84%
and realized those subcategories
probably would explain it.

00:08:38.117 --> 00:08:38.917 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:08:38.917 --> 00:08:40.850 align:middle line:84%
Let's go into what
the boundaries are

00:08:40.850 --> 00:08:43.860 align:middle line:84%
and what thin wall and
thick wall constitute.

00:08:43.860 --> 00:08:44.660 align:middle line:90%
>>JAWER: Yeah.

00:08:44.660 --> 00:08:47.810 align:middle line:84%
So the idea is that
everyone is somewhere along

00:08:47.810 --> 00:08:49.910 align:middle line:84%
the spectrum from
extremely thick boundary

00:08:49.910 --> 00:08:52.100 align:middle line:90%
to extremely thin boundary.

00:08:52.100 --> 00:08:53.660 align:middle line:84%
An extremely thick
boundary person

00:08:53.660 --> 00:08:57.080 align:middle line:84%
is someone who is sort
of stoic, doesn't really

00:08:57.080 --> 00:09:00.710 align:middle line:84%
understand what they're
feeling at any given moment.

00:09:00.710 --> 00:09:03.305 align:middle line:84%
Dreams in black and white,
has sort of pedestrian dreams.

00:09:03.305 --> 00:09:05.930 align:middle line:84%
Doesn't really give a whole lot
of credence to what they dream.

00:09:05.930 --> 00:09:07.520 align:middle line:90%
It's not a big deal for them.

00:09:07.520 --> 00:09:11.030 align:middle line:84%
Is highly organized,
kind of disciplined,

00:09:11.030 --> 00:09:13.610 align:middle line:84%
sees the world in
black and white.

00:09:13.610 --> 00:09:16.120 align:middle line:84%
Whereas a highly thin
boundary person is precisely

00:09:16.120 --> 00:09:16.920 align:middle line:90%
the opposite.

00:09:16.920 --> 00:09:19.430 align:middle line:84%
They see all kinds
of shades of gray.

00:09:19.430 --> 00:09:21.620 align:middle line:90%
They're very reactive.

00:09:21.620 --> 00:09:23.270 align:middle line:84%
They're very concerned
about emotion.

00:09:23.270 --> 00:09:25.520 align:middle line:90%
They react viscerally to things.

00:09:25.520 --> 00:09:27.770 align:middle line:84%
Stuff that happened to
them a long time ago,

00:09:27.770 --> 00:09:30.590 align:middle line:84%
it's almost still in the
present day for them.

00:09:30.590 --> 00:09:32.540 align:middle line:84%
They can recollect
things very clearly.

00:09:32.540 --> 00:09:36.170 align:middle line:84%
And they also have very
colorful memorable dreams.

00:09:36.170 --> 00:09:38.960 align:middle line:84%
And then there's everybody,
all grades in between.

00:09:38.960 --> 00:09:41.240 align:middle line:84%
So it's just an interesting
way to look at people.

00:09:41.240 --> 00:09:43.520 align:middle line:84%
And my particular
interest, Regina,

00:09:43.520 --> 00:09:46.460 align:middle line:84%
is really how it
relates to feelings

00:09:46.460 --> 00:09:51.050 align:middle line:84%
and how closely identified
people are with their feelings.

00:09:51.050 --> 00:09:53.600 align:middle line:84%
Because I think that's a
kind of overlooked aspect

00:09:53.600 --> 00:09:56.660 align:middle line:84%
and a very fundamental aspect of
how we operate as human beings.

00:09:56.660 --> 00:09:59.210 align:middle line:84%
People don't all
operate the same way,

00:09:59.210 --> 00:10:03.300 align:middle line:84%
and feelings have a strong,
definite power to them.

00:10:03.300 --> 00:10:04.790 align:middle line:84%
And I think that
also lends itself

00:10:04.790 --> 00:10:07.590 align:middle line:84%
to studying some of these
anomalous circumstances.

00:10:07.590 --> 00:10:08.390 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: OK.

00:10:08.390 --> 00:10:10.280 align:middle line:84%
So now this gets into
a question that's

00:10:10.280 --> 00:10:12.170 align:middle line:90%
one of my favorite topics.

00:10:12.170 --> 00:10:13.700 align:middle line:84%
And that is kind
of breaking down

00:10:13.700 --> 00:10:16.340 align:middle line:84%
the difference between
emotions and feelings,

00:10:16.340 --> 00:10:19.580 align:middle line:84%
because oftentimes they're
perceived quite differently.

00:10:19.580 --> 00:10:23.390 align:middle line:84%
For myself, I'll just say
I've always perceived feelings

00:10:23.390 --> 00:10:25.040 align:middle line:90%
as something that inform.

00:10:25.040 --> 00:10:28.280 align:middle line:84%
It's more of some information
coming in that you

00:10:28.280 --> 00:10:30.920 align:middle line:90%
can choose to react to or not.

00:10:30.920 --> 00:10:32.120 align:middle line:90%
But it's information.

00:10:32.120 --> 00:10:34.730 align:middle line:84%
It's informing, where
it seems that emotions

00:10:34.730 --> 00:10:37.970 align:middle line:90%
are often reactive, reactive.

00:10:37.970 --> 00:10:40.830 align:middle line:84%
And so I'm going to give
you a little example

00:10:40.830 --> 00:10:42.907 align:middle line:84%
so you can tell me
what would be going on,

00:10:42.907 --> 00:10:44.990 align:middle line:84%
because we're talking about
the sensitivity thing.

00:10:44.990 --> 00:10:47.930 align:middle line:84%
And as you were talking, this
memory popped back to mind.

00:10:47.930 --> 00:10:50.930 align:middle line:84%
So my son who was
quite sensitive--

00:10:50.930 --> 00:10:53.900 align:middle line:84%
and I'm pretty sensitive
so it would seem--

00:10:53.900 --> 00:10:55.460 align:middle line:84%
went to a friend's
house for dinner.

00:10:55.460 --> 00:10:56.480 align:middle line:90%
And he comes up.

00:10:56.480 --> 00:10:57.500 align:middle line:90%
And he's 12 years old.

00:10:57.500 --> 00:10:59.857 align:middle line:84%
He's kind of tugging
to get my attention,

00:10:59.857 --> 00:11:01.190 align:middle line:90%
because he's doing his homework.

00:11:01.190 --> 00:11:04.160 align:middle line:84%
And it's actually a
ladies dinner, right?

00:11:04.160 --> 00:11:06.710 align:middle line:84%
And he said, mom, can
we get out of here?

00:11:06.710 --> 00:11:08.090 align:middle line:90%
And I said, what's up, honey?

00:11:08.090 --> 00:11:11.180 align:middle line:84%
And he said, look at
the color of the walls.

00:11:11.180 --> 00:11:13.040 align:middle line:90%
I said, I know, it's awful.

00:11:13.040 --> 00:11:14.090 align:middle line:90%
It's really hard.

00:11:14.090 --> 00:11:17.010 align:middle line:84%
And I understood
exactly what he meant.

00:11:17.010 --> 00:11:18.680 align:middle line:84%
And both of us
have a sensitivity

00:11:18.680 --> 00:11:21.770 align:middle line:84%
going into people's
spaces, because oftentimes

00:11:21.770 --> 00:11:24.950 align:middle line:84%
the light, and the colors,
and the way the lighting is

00:11:24.950 --> 00:11:28.050 align:middle line:84%
and all that are just
really harsh or not right.

00:11:28.050 --> 00:11:29.510 align:middle line:90%
Something's off in them.

00:11:29.510 --> 00:11:33.710 align:middle line:84%
So that's a feeling it seems,
although his response became

00:11:33.710 --> 00:11:34.750 align:middle line:90%
emotional.

00:11:34.750 --> 00:11:35.750 align:middle line:90%
You see what I'm saying?

00:11:35.750 --> 00:11:36.950 align:middle line:90%
>>JAWER: Yes, yes.

00:11:36.950 --> 00:11:40.220 align:middle line:84%
And I should say that
what you're describing

00:11:40.220 --> 00:11:42.470 align:middle line:84%
was summed up by
a series of books

00:11:42.470 --> 00:11:44.460 align:middle line:84%
actually by a woman
named Elaine Aron.

00:11:44.460 --> 00:11:45.507 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Oh.

00:11:45.507 --> 00:11:47.090 align:middle line:84%
>>JAWER: "The Highly
Sensitive Person"

00:11:47.090 --> 00:11:51.200 align:middle line:84%
is the name of her series
of books and website.

00:11:51.200 --> 00:11:54.140 align:middle line:84%
And that's where I learned a
lot about different aspects

00:11:54.140 --> 00:11:55.460 align:middle line:90%
of being highly sensitive.

00:11:55.460 --> 00:11:56.900 align:middle line:90%
She's out in the West Coast.

00:11:56.900 --> 00:11:59.760 align:middle line:84%
And so what you're describing
is fairly typical for highly

00:11:59.760 --> 00:12:00.560 align:middle line:90%
sensitive people.

00:12:00.560 --> 00:12:02.768 align:middle line:84%
They react to all kinds of
things in the environment.

00:12:02.768 --> 00:12:03.680 align:middle line:90%
So you're right.

00:12:03.680 --> 00:12:06.110 align:middle line:90%
The feeling is a reaction.

00:12:06.110 --> 00:12:08.550 align:middle line:84%
Now people define feelings
and emotions differently.

00:12:08.550 --> 00:12:10.280 align:middle line:84%
There are neuroscientists
who describe it

00:12:10.280 --> 00:12:12.590 align:middle line:84%
in very different
ways than I would.

00:12:12.590 --> 00:12:14.472 align:middle line:84%
But I agree with
you that the feeling

00:12:14.472 --> 00:12:15.680 align:middle line:90%
is something that's internal.

00:12:15.680 --> 00:12:17.540 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Yeah, it's kind
of information coming in.

00:12:17.540 --> 00:12:18.650 align:middle line:90%
>>JAWER: Correct, correct.

00:12:18.650 --> 00:12:20.232 align:middle line:84%
And it's an assessment,
really, of--

00:12:20.232 --> 00:12:21.815 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: An assessment,
that's right.

00:12:21.815 --> 00:12:22.910 align:middle line:84%
>>JAWER: --how you're
feeling, how you're doing

00:12:22.910 --> 00:12:24.270 align:middle line:90%
in that particular situation.

00:12:24.270 --> 00:12:26.840 align:middle line:84%
So feelings are
essential to being human.

00:12:26.840 --> 00:12:30.868 align:middle line:84%
If we weren't feeling creatures,
we would be zombies or robots,

00:12:30.868 --> 00:12:31.910 align:middle line:90%
and that would be no fun.

00:12:31.910 --> 00:12:32.710 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:12:32.710 --> 00:12:35.990 align:middle line:84%
>>JAWER: The emotions, as
the word suggests, to emote

00:12:35.990 --> 00:12:38.750 align:middle line:90%
is to express a feeling.

00:12:38.750 --> 00:12:41.880 align:middle line:84%
And people differ in that
way along that scale.

00:12:41.880 --> 00:12:45.620 align:middle line:84%
Also some people are much
more emotive and some less so.

00:12:45.620 --> 00:12:48.110 align:middle line:84%
And again, the thick to
thin boundary spectrum

00:12:48.110 --> 00:12:50.780 align:middle line:84%
gets to that aspect of
people's reactivity.

00:12:50.780 --> 00:12:54.500 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So would people
who are, say, more sensitive

00:12:54.500 --> 00:12:55.640 align:middle line:90%
be more reactive?

00:12:55.640 --> 00:12:57.080 align:middle line:90%
>>JAWER: Yes, very much so.

00:12:57.080 --> 00:12:57.890 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: OK.

00:12:57.890 --> 00:12:59.480 align:middle line:84%
Even if they don't express
it, because you have

00:12:59.480 --> 00:13:02.130 align:middle line:84%
extroverts and introverts, and
you get into that whole thing.

00:13:02.130 --> 00:13:04.213 align:middle line:84%
So they may not express
it, but they're definitely

00:13:04.213 --> 00:13:05.060 align:middle line:90%
reacting to it.

00:13:05.060 --> 00:13:05.960 align:middle line:84%
>>JAWER: That's
absolutely right.

00:13:05.960 --> 00:13:06.760 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: OK.

00:13:06.760 --> 00:13:08.720 align:middle line:84%
So I think who you're
talking to right now,

00:13:08.720 --> 00:13:12.470 align:middle line:84%
our audience is probably going
to be very much thin-walled

00:13:12.470 --> 00:13:15.187 align:middle line:90%
dominant, just so you know.

00:13:15.187 --> 00:13:17.770 align:middle line:84%
>>JAWER: Well that's a big part
of my audience over the years,

00:13:17.770 --> 00:13:18.040 align:middle line:90%
sure.

00:13:18.040 --> 00:13:19.415 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: That's
what I'm saying.

00:13:19.415 --> 00:13:21.385 align:middle line:84%
Yeah, I think you've
got your audience here.

00:13:21.385 --> 00:13:21.550 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:13:21.550 --> 00:13:23.350 align:middle line:84%
Let's talk about the
notion, because we

00:13:23.350 --> 00:13:25.690 align:middle line:84%
want to segue into
the notion of some

00:13:25.690 --> 00:13:28.060 align:middle line:84%
of these anomalous or
paranormal experiences.

00:13:28.060 --> 00:13:30.640 align:middle line:84%
And you say that exceptional
abilities in humans

00:13:30.640 --> 00:13:33.970 align:middle line:84%
are more a matter of extended
and connected empathy

00:13:33.970 --> 00:13:36.760 align:middle line:84%
rather than, say, what
we know as telepathy.

00:13:36.760 --> 00:13:39.088 align:middle line:90%
Tell us what that means.

00:13:39.088 --> 00:13:40.880 align:middle line:84%
>>JAWER: Well we're
empathizing or we ought

00:13:40.880 --> 00:13:42.900 align:middle line:90%
to be all the time with people.

00:13:42.900 --> 00:13:45.920 align:middle line:84%
I mean that's what makes
the world go around.

00:13:45.920 --> 00:13:50.090 align:middle line:84%
What I sort of set out in this
latest book "Sensitive Soul" is

00:13:50.090 --> 00:13:53.060 align:middle line:84%
that there's a variety of
conditions and capabilities

00:13:53.060 --> 00:13:56.180 align:middle line:84%
that people have that are
conditioned to a greater

00:13:56.180 --> 00:13:57.830 align:middle line:84%
extent, influenced
to a greater extent,

00:13:57.830 --> 00:14:01.460 align:middle line:84%
by their mode of feeling,
by the way that they feel

00:14:01.460 --> 00:14:04.340 align:middle line:84%
and their preponderance
to express themselves,

00:14:04.340 --> 00:14:07.280 align:middle line:84%
and the combination of nature
and nurture that sort of

00:14:07.280 --> 00:14:08.850 align:middle line:90%
makes them that way.

00:14:08.850 --> 00:14:14.900 align:middle line:84%
So I look at conditions
like autism, synesthesia,

00:14:14.900 --> 00:14:18.110 align:middle line:84%
which is overlapping
senses like feeling a shape

00:14:18.110 --> 00:14:20.300 align:middle line:90%
or tasting a color.

00:14:20.300 --> 00:14:23.838 align:middle line:84%
People think this is kind
of crazy, but it's a thing.

00:14:23.838 --> 00:14:25.130 align:middle line:90%
Some people are wired that way.

00:14:25.130 --> 00:14:26.547 align:middle line:84%
They come into the
world that way.

00:14:26.547 --> 00:14:27.518 align:middle line:90%
It's--

00:14:27.518 --> 00:14:29.060 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Like a
crossover of senses.

00:14:29.060 --> 00:14:30.268 align:middle line:90%
>>JAWER: Crossover of senses.

00:14:30.268 --> 00:14:32.450 align:middle line:84%
And for some people, it's
just the way they are.

00:14:32.450 --> 00:14:34.303 align:middle line:84%
And they think that's
the way everybody

00:14:34.303 --> 00:14:35.720 align:middle line:84%
is until they get
to a certain age

00:14:35.720 --> 00:14:37.220 align:middle line:84%
and realize they're
in the minority.

00:14:37.220 --> 00:14:41.060 align:middle line:84%
Savontism, which is having
a particular amazing skill

00:14:41.060 --> 00:14:43.550 align:middle line:84%
but having some particular
limitations mentally

00:14:43.550 --> 00:14:44.820 align:middle line:90%
and emotionally as well.

00:14:44.820 --> 00:14:48.230 align:middle line:84%
These are all examples
of people who have

00:14:48.230 --> 00:14:50.300 align:middle line:90%
unique emotional processing.

00:14:50.300 --> 00:14:52.790 align:middle line:84%
But interestingly, I
should mention, Regina,

00:14:52.790 --> 00:14:55.130 align:middle line:84%
that thick boundary
people have a role

00:14:55.130 --> 00:14:57.745 align:middle line:90%
in anomalous occurrences also.

00:14:57.745 --> 00:14:59.870 align:middle line:84%
They might actually be more
responsible for getting

00:14:59.870 --> 00:15:02.328 align:middle line:84%
them started, whereas it's the
thin boundary people who are

00:15:02.328 --> 00:15:03.610 align:middle line:90%
more likely to apprehend them.

00:15:03.610 --> 00:15:03.860 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Interesting.

00:15:03.860 --> 00:15:05.000 align:middle line:84%
>>JAWER: It's my
suspicion anyway.

00:15:05.000 --> 00:15:06.458 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Yeah,
that's interesting.

00:15:06.458 --> 00:15:08.960 align:middle line:84%
Givers, receivers, same
thing when you're even

00:15:08.960 --> 00:15:11.240 align:middle line:84%
talking more kind
of telepathically

00:15:11.240 --> 00:15:13.580 align:middle line:84%
of people who can
receive easier and others

00:15:13.580 --> 00:15:17.850 align:middle line:84%
who can send out an
impression more successfully.

00:15:17.850 --> 00:15:20.600 align:middle line:84%
So we need to first take a
look at the role of trauma

00:15:20.600 --> 00:15:21.537 align:middle line:90%
in all of it.

00:15:21.537 --> 00:15:23.120 align:middle line:84%
Let's look at how
trauma plays a role.

00:15:23.120 --> 00:15:24.662 align:middle line:84%
Because there was
one thing you wrote

00:15:24.662 --> 00:15:27.440 align:middle line:84%
in your book that was
interesting about a soldier

00:15:27.440 --> 00:15:30.590 align:middle line:84%
that you are saying that
how a soldier reacts

00:15:30.590 --> 00:15:33.920 align:middle line:84%
in the field, which is under
extreme pressure, may be more

00:15:33.920 --> 00:15:37.130 align:middle line:84%
a result of childhood
trauma than what's actually

00:15:37.130 --> 00:15:38.340 align:middle line:90%
occurring in the moment.

00:15:38.340 --> 00:15:42.280 align:middle line:84%
So just as an example, give
us an idea of what that means.

00:15:42.280 --> 00:15:43.750 align:middle line:84%
>>JAWER: Well I
guess I would first

00:15:43.750 --> 00:15:47.920 align:middle line:84%
say that it might be helpful
for folks to picture feelings

00:15:47.920 --> 00:15:49.930 align:middle line:90%
as like water.

00:15:49.930 --> 00:15:52.030 align:middle line:84%
The feelings have
an energy to them.

00:15:52.030 --> 00:15:54.970 align:middle line:84%
And we get a sense for
that by the word "emotion."

00:15:54.970 --> 00:15:58.210 align:middle line:84%
When you emote, you have a sense
of feelings flowing outward,

00:15:58.210 --> 00:16:00.340 align:middle line:90%
or you should.

00:16:00.340 --> 00:16:02.405 align:middle line:90%
And people differ day to day.

00:16:02.405 --> 00:16:04.030 align:middle line:84%
You could be having
a great day and say

00:16:04.030 --> 00:16:06.130 align:middle line:90%
I'm really feeling up today.

00:16:06.130 --> 00:16:10.870 align:middle line:84%
And you can just feel
happier and more expansive.

00:16:10.870 --> 00:16:13.060 align:middle line:84%
Whereas other days,
you feel down.

00:16:13.060 --> 00:16:14.477 align:middle line:84%
And you sort of
feel constricted.

00:16:14.477 --> 00:16:15.310 align:middle line:90%
I'm just down today.

00:16:15.310 --> 00:16:18.020 align:middle line:84%
I don't know and in the
doldrums, that kind of thing.

00:16:18.020 --> 00:16:20.430 align:middle line:84%
So feelings really have an
impetus or an energy to them.

00:16:20.430 --> 00:16:22.240 align:middle line:84%
And I think that's
important to note,

00:16:22.240 --> 00:16:24.520 align:middle line:84%
because in traumatic
situations--

00:16:24.520 --> 00:16:26.440 align:middle line:84%
and highly sensitive
people are probably

00:16:26.440 --> 00:16:30.825 align:middle line:84%
more likely to react and feel
that something is traumatic

00:16:30.825 --> 00:16:32.200 align:middle line:84%
or it becomes
traumatic for them,

00:16:32.200 --> 00:16:33.820 align:middle line:90%
because they're more reactive.

00:16:33.820 --> 00:16:36.670 align:middle line:84%
But the key to
weathering trauma is

00:16:36.670 --> 00:16:38.740 align:middle line:84%
to identifying what's
going on and then

00:16:38.740 --> 00:16:43.240 align:middle line:84%
being able, ultimately, to emote
and to reconcile the situation

00:16:43.240 --> 00:16:45.530 align:middle line:90%
and your reaction to it.

00:16:45.530 --> 00:16:49.270 align:middle line:84%
The difficulty is that, for some
people, it can be overwhelming.

00:16:49.270 --> 00:16:52.840 align:middle line:84%
And based on where they are
on the boundary spectrum,

00:16:52.840 --> 00:16:54.710 align:middle line:84%
it may prove to be
a problem later on.

00:16:54.710 --> 00:16:56.140 align:middle line:84%
And I guess the
perfect example is

00:16:56.140 --> 00:16:59.020 align:middle line:84%
PTSD, which is one
of the conditions

00:16:59.020 --> 00:17:00.880 align:middle line:90%
that I address in the book.

00:17:00.880 --> 00:17:03.700 align:middle line:84%
Most people think
of PTSD as being

00:17:03.700 --> 00:17:06.190 align:middle line:90%
sort of a flashbulb memory.

00:17:06.190 --> 00:17:10.180 align:middle line:84%
People have an immediate
reaction when a car backfires,

00:17:10.180 --> 00:17:15.670 align:middle line:84%
and they're back on the
battlefield in Iraq, let's say.

00:17:15.670 --> 00:17:19.640 align:middle line:84%
And they're flooded by the sense
that they had at that moment.

00:17:19.640 --> 00:17:22.700 align:middle line:84%
So that's the popular
conception of PTSD.

00:17:22.700 --> 00:17:25.359 align:middle line:84%
And it tends to be that
way for most people

00:17:25.359 --> 00:17:26.920 align:middle line:90%
that suffer from PTSD.

00:17:26.920 --> 00:17:32.020 align:middle line:84%
But anywhere from 15%-30% of
folks who suffer from PTSD

00:17:32.020 --> 00:17:33.710 align:middle line:90%
experience it differently.

00:17:33.710 --> 00:17:38.180 align:middle line:84%
So that there is
a prompt, but they

00:17:38.180 --> 00:17:41.450 align:middle line:84%
don't get the immediate
visceral reaction of it.

00:17:41.450 --> 00:17:45.470 align:middle line:84%
Their form is more
dissociated form of PTSD.

00:17:45.470 --> 00:17:48.230 align:middle line:84%
In other words, they're not
feeling their feelings so much.

00:17:48.230 --> 00:17:51.305 align:middle line:84%
And they're just sort of
depressed and not sure.

00:17:51.305 --> 00:17:52.680 align:middle line:84%
They're walking
through pea soup.

00:17:52.680 --> 00:17:55.850 align:middle line:84%
They just don't know
really what's the matter.

00:17:55.850 --> 00:17:58.010 align:middle line:84%
So it really speaks to the
way the trauma plays out

00:17:58.010 --> 00:17:59.390 align:middle line:90%
with different people.

00:17:59.390 --> 00:18:01.070 align:middle line:84%
And people's
predilection for trauma,

00:18:01.070 --> 00:18:04.100 align:middle line:84%
obviously, has something to do
with their innate sensitivity

00:18:04.100 --> 00:18:08.108 align:middle line:84%
at the time that occurrence
happens, to what extent

00:18:08.108 --> 00:18:09.650 align:middle line:84%
they're overwhelmed
or to what extent

00:18:09.650 --> 00:18:12.170 align:middle line:84%
they're able to fathom
what's happening

00:18:12.170 --> 00:18:14.445 align:middle line:90%
and to react to it productively.

00:18:14.445 --> 00:18:16.070 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And it
seems like what you're

00:18:16.070 --> 00:18:18.500 align:middle line:84%
saying in the book
is that trauma often

00:18:18.500 --> 00:18:22.040 align:middle line:84%
is at the base of people
who are displaying

00:18:22.040 --> 00:18:25.190 align:middle line:90%
exceptional abilities.

00:18:25.190 --> 00:18:26.288 align:middle line:90%
Did I misread that?

00:18:26.288 --> 00:18:27.830 align:middle line:84%
>>JAWER: Well I
guess what I'm saying

00:18:27.830 --> 00:18:32.510 align:middle line:84%
is that dissociation, which
is sort of part and parcel

00:18:32.510 --> 00:18:35.030 align:middle line:84%
with trauma,
dissociation plays a role

00:18:35.030 --> 00:18:37.820 align:middle line:84%
in a lot of these kinds
of anomalous phenomena,

00:18:37.820 --> 00:18:40.680 align:middle line:84%
because the feelings
sort of go Underground

00:18:40.680 --> 00:18:41.480 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: I see.

00:18:41.480 --> 00:18:43.850 align:middle line:84%
>>JAWER: But my perspective
on it is that the people--

00:18:43.850 --> 00:18:47.420 align:middle line:84%
you wouldn't have anomalous
occurrences without people.

00:18:47.420 --> 00:18:49.970 align:middle line:84%
And you wouldn't have
them without feelings

00:18:49.970 --> 00:18:53.270 align:middle line:84%
that have basically
gone underground,

00:18:53.270 --> 00:18:56.090 align:middle line:90%
like that kind of PTSD.

00:18:56.090 --> 00:19:00.170 align:middle line:84%
And those are the
feelings that somehow

00:19:00.170 --> 00:19:02.570 align:middle line:84%
get extended into the
environment and in a sense

00:19:02.570 --> 00:19:04.470 align:middle line:90%
take on a life of their own.

00:19:04.470 --> 00:19:05.700 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: I'm going to
throw this quote out there,

00:19:05.700 --> 00:19:06.750 align:middle line:84%
and then we're
going to start going

00:19:06.750 --> 00:19:08.010 align:middle line:90%
into some of these incidences.

00:19:08.010 --> 00:19:10.468 align:middle line:84%
Just because I love the quote
and it's in your book, right?

00:19:10.468 --> 00:19:12.720 align:middle line:84%
OK, because we're
all thinking, oh, I'm

00:19:12.720 --> 00:19:15.640 align:middle line:84%
thicker or thinner skinned than
this person or that, whatnot.

00:19:15.640 --> 00:19:18.510 align:middle line:84%
And then when you consider
this quote in terms of what's

00:19:18.510 --> 00:19:20.050 align:middle line:90%
normal, we're all thick.

00:19:20.050 --> 00:19:20.850 align:middle line:90%
OK?

00:19:20.850 --> 00:19:22.305 align:middle line:90%
And this is from Douglas Adams.

00:19:22.305 --> 00:19:24.930 align:middle line:84%
He says, "The fact that we live
at the bottom of a deep gravity

00:19:24.930 --> 00:19:27.330 align:middle line:84%
well on the surface of
a gas covered planet

00:19:27.330 --> 00:19:31.740 align:middle line:84%
going around a nuclear
fireball 90 million miles away

00:19:31.740 --> 00:19:33.810 align:middle line:84%
and think this is
normal is obviously

00:19:33.810 --> 00:19:36.870 align:middle line:84%
some indication of how skewed
our perspective of normal

00:19:36.870 --> 00:19:37.860 align:middle line:90%
tends to be."

00:19:37.860 --> 00:19:41.350 align:middle line:84%
[LAUGHING] So what
is normal anyway

00:19:41.350 --> 00:19:45.040 align:middle line:84%
that we're even surviving
here in this environment.

00:19:45.040 --> 00:19:47.753 align:middle line:90%
So let's go ahead and look at--

00:19:47.753 --> 00:19:49.170 align:middle line:84%
I didn't see his
name in the book.

00:19:49.170 --> 00:19:51.540 align:middle line:84%
It was the son of the
psychologist Joseph Pearce,

00:19:51.540 --> 00:19:54.540 align:middle line:84%
what happened to him at
five when he launched

00:19:54.540 --> 00:19:56.500 align:middle line:90%
into that 20-minute lecture.

00:19:56.500 --> 00:19:57.300 align:middle line:90%
OK?

00:19:57.300 --> 00:19:58.480 align:middle line:90%
So set it up.

00:19:58.480 --> 00:19:59.280 align:middle line:90%
>>JAWER: Yes.

00:19:59.280 --> 00:20:02.250 align:middle line:84%
So there are some
kids that seem to have

00:20:02.250 --> 00:20:06.180 align:middle line:84%
a preternatural
intelligence or ability.

00:20:06.180 --> 00:20:09.270 align:middle line:84%
It's most closely associated
with child prodigies.

00:20:09.270 --> 00:20:10.410 align:middle line:90%
He stunned his father.

00:20:10.410 --> 00:20:11.970 align:middle line:84%
His father was
teaching, I think,

00:20:11.970 --> 00:20:13.740 align:middle line:84%
a college course
and was preparing

00:20:13.740 --> 00:20:15.480 align:middle line:90%
to go off to work that morning.

00:20:15.480 --> 00:20:18.540 align:middle line:84%
And his son sort of
lectured him and used

00:20:18.540 --> 00:20:21.450 align:middle line:84%
words that were just
not in the vocabulary

00:20:21.450 --> 00:20:22.630 align:middle line:90%
of a typical five-year-old.

00:20:22.630 --> 00:20:24.900 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Well about the
subject of God and man.

00:20:24.900 --> 00:20:26.970 align:middle line:84%
>>JAWER: Yes, very
profound subjects.

00:20:26.970 --> 00:20:32.040 align:middle line:10%
And he was expounding about
God, and truth, and the word

00:20:32.040 --> 00:20:33.390 align:middle line:10%
of being, and so forth.

00:20:33.390 --> 00:20:35.670 align:middle line:84%
And his father
didn't understand it.

00:20:35.670 --> 00:20:40.230 align:middle line:84%
But I think he says in the
book that just this realization

00:20:40.230 --> 00:20:43.260 align:middle line:84%
dawned on him that something
amazing was happening.

00:20:43.260 --> 00:20:46.920 align:middle line:84%
Kind of a feeling right
up his spine like this

00:20:46.920 --> 00:20:47.825 align:middle line:90%
is just not ordinary.

00:20:47.825 --> 00:20:48.700 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Not normal.

00:20:48.700 --> 00:20:49.500 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:20:49.500 --> 00:20:51.540 align:middle line:84%
>>JAWER: Yeah, yeah,
but it is very human.

00:20:51.540 --> 00:20:53.530 align:middle line:84%
And the question is,
where does it come from?

00:20:53.530 --> 00:20:54.720 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Well that's
the interesting part.

00:20:54.720 --> 00:20:56.553 align:middle line:84%
And there's a lot of
conjecture around that.

00:20:56.553 --> 00:20:58.200 align:middle line:84%
One of the things
you said in the book

00:20:58.200 --> 00:21:00.450 align:middle line:84%
is that the son's
eyes appeared--

00:21:00.450 --> 00:21:02.700 align:middle line:84%
he was in a very monotone
voice, and his eyes

00:21:02.700 --> 00:21:05.700 align:middle line:84%
appeared to just be very
still, almost glossed over

00:21:05.700 --> 00:21:08.010 align:middle line:84%
as he was allowing
this information

00:21:08.010 --> 00:21:09.030 align:middle line:90%
to flow through him.

00:21:09.030 --> 00:21:13.410 align:middle line:84%
Now if you turn to metaphysical
or you turn to religious sects,

00:21:13.410 --> 00:21:15.720 align:middle line:84%
they're going to say,
well, someone was speaking

00:21:15.720 --> 00:21:17.670 align:middle line:90%
through him, not of him.

00:21:17.670 --> 00:21:19.110 align:middle line:84%
So how would you
respond to that?

00:21:19.110 --> 00:21:20.818 align:middle line:84%
Because with our
audience a lot of people

00:21:20.818 --> 00:21:22.783 align:middle line:84%
are going to say the guy
was channeling, right?

00:21:22.783 --> 00:21:23.700 align:middle line:90%
>>JAWER: Right, right.

00:21:23.700 --> 00:21:26.880 align:middle line:84%
And I'd bring up the
term dissociation again.

00:21:26.880 --> 00:21:29.070 align:middle line:84%
Because whenever somebody
is sort of distant

00:21:29.070 --> 00:21:30.415 align:middle line:90%
from themselves, which--

00:21:30.415 --> 00:21:32.040 align:middle line:84%
you mentioned trauma
before, that's why

00:21:32.040 --> 00:21:34.410 align:middle line:84%
I said dissociation is
part and parcel of trauma,

00:21:34.410 --> 00:21:36.150 align:middle line:84%
people lose their
sense of themselves.

00:21:36.150 --> 00:21:40.230 align:middle line:84%
And they don't feel things
as they typically do.

00:21:40.230 --> 00:21:43.680 align:middle line:84%
And in all cases where
you have mediums--

00:21:43.680 --> 00:21:46.162 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Yeah, can
that leave them open?

00:21:46.162 --> 00:21:48.630 align:middle line:84%
>>JAWER: They are dissociating
from their own day-to-day

00:21:48.630 --> 00:21:49.230 align:middle line:90%
experience.

00:21:49.230 --> 00:21:50.940 align:middle line:84%
And the question is
what are they accessing?

00:21:50.940 --> 00:21:51.810 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: What are
they accessing?

00:21:51.810 --> 00:21:52.620 align:middle line:90%
Exactly.

00:21:52.620 --> 00:21:55.170 align:middle line:84%
>>JAWER: And it's hard to say
because, Regina, certainly

00:21:55.170 --> 00:21:59.640 align:middle line:84%
there are authors of
terrific works of fiction

00:21:59.640 --> 00:22:03.060 align:middle line:84%
who develop so many different
kinds of characters.

00:22:03.060 --> 00:22:05.445 align:middle line:84%
And they will say that when
they sit down to write--

00:22:05.445 --> 00:22:06.570 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: It just shows up.

00:22:06.570 --> 00:22:07.350 align:middle line:90%
>>JAWER: --it just shows up.

00:22:07.350 --> 00:22:09.240 align:middle line:84%
And they don't know
how they're coming up

00:22:09.240 --> 00:22:11.800 align:middle line:84%
with this incredible
creativity, but they come up

00:22:11.800 --> 00:22:13.050 align:middle line:90%
with very distinct characters.

00:22:13.050 --> 00:22:14.310 align:middle line:84%
And they don't know
where the story is going.

00:22:14.310 --> 00:22:16.750 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: It's like they're
literally just transcribing

00:22:16.750 --> 00:22:17.610 align:middle line:90%
something.

00:22:17.610 --> 00:22:19.620 align:middle line:84%
>>JAWER: They feel that
the muse is guiding them

00:22:19.620 --> 00:22:21.360 align:middle line:90%
and they are just the vessel.

00:22:21.360 --> 00:22:22.818 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: I mean
with someone who's

00:22:22.818 --> 00:22:25.410 align:middle line:84%
five to give a 20-minute
discourse on the nature of God

00:22:25.410 --> 00:22:27.600 align:middle line:84%
and man, it would
certainly seem it's not

00:22:27.600 --> 00:22:30.570 align:middle line:84%
coming from his personal
experience at this point.

00:22:30.570 --> 00:22:32.710 align:middle line:84%
It is coming from
something somewhere.

00:22:32.710 --> 00:22:33.510 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:22:33.510 --> 00:22:34.310 align:middle line:90%
>>JAWER: Yeah.

00:22:34.310 --> 00:22:35.880 align:middle line:84%
And what I look
at in the book is

00:22:35.880 --> 00:22:39.930 align:middle line:84%
the process of possible prenatal
precursor to what's happening.

00:22:39.930 --> 00:22:42.480 align:middle line:84%
Because what I
sort of alighted on

00:22:42.480 --> 00:22:46.380 align:middle line:84%
is that in many cases
of child prodigies,

00:22:46.380 --> 00:22:51.510 align:middle line:84%
and they display these
kinds of uncanny abilities.

00:22:51.510 --> 00:22:53.580 align:middle line:84%
And recollections,
they have recollections

00:22:53.580 --> 00:22:55.350 align:middle line:90%
of being in utero.

00:22:55.350 --> 00:22:59.040 align:middle line:84%
And they have,
apparently, recollections

00:22:59.040 --> 00:23:01.390 align:middle line:84%
of somebody else's
life in some cases.

00:23:01.390 --> 00:23:03.030 align:middle line:90%
So where does that come from?

00:23:03.030 --> 00:23:05.950 align:middle line:84%
What I noticed is that
in many of these cases,

00:23:05.950 --> 00:23:09.420 align:middle line:84%
there was some issue
during the pregnancy.

00:23:09.420 --> 00:23:13.230 align:middle line:84%
In some cases, the mother
suffered a severe shock.

00:23:13.230 --> 00:23:14.672 align:middle line:90%
There was an accident.

00:23:14.672 --> 00:23:16.380 align:middle line:84%
In one case that's
mentioned in the book,

00:23:16.380 --> 00:23:20.010 align:middle line:84%
the husband and wife came
home when she was pregnant

00:23:20.010 --> 00:23:22.650 align:middle line:84%
and they found people that were
breaking into their home, which

00:23:22.650 --> 00:23:24.540 align:middle line:90%
was scary.

00:23:24.540 --> 00:23:26.940 align:middle line:84%
There's also conditions
like preeclampsia,

00:23:26.940 --> 00:23:28.620 align:middle line:84%
which is apparently
something that can

00:23:28.620 --> 00:23:31.950 align:middle line:90%
affect the pregnancy adversely.

00:23:31.950 --> 00:23:34.602 align:middle line:84%
And premature births as
well and difficult births.

00:23:34.602 --> 00:23:36.810 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So let's say you've
had a challenging birth

00:23:36.810 --> 00:23:38.850 align:middle line:84%
or you've had a
challenging gestation,

00:23:38.850 --> 00:23:40.880 align:middle line:84%
so what are you saying
this does to the being?

00:23:40.880 --> 00:23:44.220 align:middle line:84%
It creates more of a
dissociative pattern

00:23:44.220 --> 00:23:47.340 align:middle line:84%
or potential in them
that can essentially

00:23:47.340 --> 00:23:49.830 align:middle line:84%
allow for something
else to come in

00:23:49.830 --> 00:23:52.042 align:middle line:84%
and kind of claim that
space energetically?

00:23:52.042 --> 00:23:53.250 align:middle line:90%
>>JAWER: Something like that.

00:23:53.250 --> 00:23:56.070 align:middle line:84%
My guesstimate about this--
and it's sheer speculation--

00:23:56.070 --> 00:23:59.940 align:middle line:84%
but my guesstimate
is that there may be

00:23:59.940 --> 00:24:01.620 align:middle line:90%
something preceding this life.

00:24:01.620 --> 00:24:02.790 align:middle line:90%
Who knows what that is.

00:24:02.790 --> 00:24:06.520 align:middle line:84%
These kids, I believe, have
a closer connection to that

00:24:06.520 --> 00:24:10.000 align:middle line:84%
because the fact that
their gestation was not

00:24:10.000 --> 00:24:12.670 align:middle line:84%
the typical pattern, that there
was something that happened.

00:24:12.670 --> 00:24:13.930 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: They were shaken
out of their comfort.

00:24:13.930 --> 00:24:15.130 align:middle line:90%
>>JAWER: They were.

00:24:15.130 --> 00:24:18.970 align:middle line:84%
Something got shaken up and so
there's an echo, so to speak,

00:24:18.970 --> 00:24:22.840 align:middle line:84%
of what came before, that
there are traces of that.

00:24:22.840 --> 00:24:24.700 align:middle line:84%
And they generally
lose those traces

00:24:24.700 --> 00:24:26.518 align:middle line:90%
by about age six or seven.

00:24:26.518 --> 00:24:28.810 align:middle line:84%
But they're very evident in
some kids up to that point.

00:24:28.810 --> 00:24:29.685 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right, yes.

00:24:29.685 --> 00:24:32.830 align:middle line:84%
I mean reading
Carol Bowman's book,

00:24:32.830 --> 00:24:34.900 align:middle line:84%
you know Ian Stevenson's
research and all that

00:24:34.900 --> 00:24:37.280 align:middle line:84%
on children and past
lives-- and we're

00:24:37.280 --> 00:24:39.030 align:middle line:84%
going to get to something
in a moment that

00:24:39.030 --> 00:24:41.140 align:middle line:90%
could sound like that.

00:24:41.140 --> 00:24:43.603 align:middle line:84%
One thing you wrote
about is a lot of times--

00:24:43.603 --> 00:24:45.520 align:middle line:84%
and forgive me if I can't
remember if it was--

00:24:45.520 --> 00:24:49.220 align:middle line:84%
whether it was prodigies or
children with autism often

00:24:49.220 --> 00:24:50.020 align:middle line:90%
have--

00:24:50.020 --> 00:24:52.630 align:middle line:84%
I think it was prodigies
have a very difficult time

00:24:52.630 --> 00:24:55.370 align:middle line:90%
with injustice.

00:24:55.370 --> 00:24:57.468 align:middle line:84%
They're very sensitive
to injustice.

00:24:57.468 --> 00:24:59.260 align:middle line:84%
Talk about that for
just a second before we

00:24:59.260 --> 00:25:01.210 align:middle line:84%
go into some of
these other stories.

00:25:01.210 --> 00:25:04.110 align:middle line:84%
>>JAWER: Well one example might
actually be Greta Thunberg--

00:25:04.110 --> 00:25:06.580 align:middle line:90%
I think she's 16 or 17 now--

00:25:06.580 --> 00:25:10.780 align:middle line:84%
who's become the face crusading
against global warming.

00:25:10.780 --> 00:25:13.210 align:middle line:84%
She went into a funk
a few years ago.

00:25:13.210 --> 00:25:15.340 align:middle line:84%
Before she reemerged
from that funk

00:25:15.340 --> 00:25:18.790 align:middle line:84%
and started her school strike
for global climate change,

00:25:18.790 --> 00:25:22.280 align:middle line:84%
she seems to be a
highly sensitive kid.

00:25:22.280 --> 00:25:23.080 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Clearly.

00:25:23.080 --> 00:25:23.530 align:middle line:90%
>>JAWER: Yes.

00:25:23.530 --> 00:25:24.460 align:middle line:90%
Now I don't know whether--

00:25:24.460 --> 00:25:25.240 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Passionately.

00:25:25.240 --> 00:25:26.282 align:middle line:90%
>>JAWER: Very passionate.

00:25:26.282 --> 00:25:27.908 align:middle line:84%
And she does have
an Asperger's--

00:25:27.908 --> 00:25:29.200 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: High function autism.

00:25:29.200 --> 00:25:30.620 align:middle line:90%
>>JAWER: High functional autism.

00:25:30.620 --> 00:25:32.920 align:middle line:84%
She was diagnosed, I think, just
within the past three or four

00:25:32.920 --> 00:25:33.190 align:middle line:90%
years.

00:25:33.190 --> 00:25:35.920 align:middle line:84%
Her parents really did not know
what was going on with her.

00:25:35.920 --> 00:25:37.300 align:middle line:84%
But she went into
this depression

00:25:37.300 --> 00:25:38.810 align:middle line:90%
then she came out this crusader.

00:25:38.810 --> 00:25:39.610 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:25:39.610 --> 00:25:42.722 align:middle line:84%
>>JAWER: So again I'd
love to ask the family--

00:25:42.722 --> 00:25:44.680 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: What kind of
trauma cracked her open.

00:25:44.680 --> 00:25:46.930 align:middle line:84%
>>JAWER: --about her pregnancy,
or her mom's pregnancy

00:25:46.930 --> 00:25:47.860 align:middle line:90%
was like with her.

00:25:47.860 --> 00:25:48.670 align:middle line:90%
I would love to know that.

00:25:48.670 --> 00:25:50.087 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Oh, well,
write to them.

00:25:50.087 --> 00:25:52.150 align:middle line:84%
I'm sure they'd be
happy to tell you.

00:25:52.150 --> 00:25:54.130 align:middle line:84%
This was one of my
favorites in the book.

00:25:54.130 --> 00:25:58.570 align:middle line:84%
So a little guy named Jay began
drawing pictures of cellos

00:25:58.570 --> 00:26:00.070 align:middle line:90%
at the age of two.

00:26:00.070 --> 00:26:03.490 align:middle line:84%
And he began playing
by the age of three.

00:26:03.490 --> 00:26:07.330 align:middle line:84%
No parental involvement
nor support,

00:26:07.330 --> 00:26:09.070 align:middle line:90%
they didn't play music.

00:26:09.070 --> 00:26:11.740 align:middle line:84%
He composed five symphonies
by the age of five.

00:26:11.740 --> 00:26:14.590 align:middle line:84%
People are thinking Beethoven
and so forth at this point,

00:26:14.590 --> 00:26:15.970 align:middle line:90%
right?

00:26:15.970 --> 00:26:17.710 align:middle line:84%
Talk about that
kind of phenomenon,

00:26:17.710 --> 00:26:19.990 align:middle line:84%
because I think that
really kind of pulls

00:26:19.990 --> 00:26:22.870 align:middle line:84%
on everybody's imagination
and heartstrings,

00:26:22.870 --> 00:26:27.202 align:middle line:84%
both to see a little person
just emerge with these talents.

00:26:27.202 --> 00:26:29.410 align:middle line:84%
>>JAWER: Yeah, that story
and many others in the book

00:26:29.410 --> 00:26:31.900 align:middle line:84%
come from a guy named
Darold Treffert, who

00:26:31.900 --> 00:26:34.673 align:middle line:84%
is probably the world's
foremost authority on prodigies.

00:26:34.673 --> 00:26:36.340 align:middle line:84%
He was the consultant
on the movie "Rain

00:26:36.340 --> 00:26:39.130 align:middle line:90%
Man" with Dustin Hoffman.

00:26:39.130 --> 00:26:41.560 align:middle line:84%
And Dustin Hoffman,
by the way, played

00:26:41.560 --> 00:26:44.745 align:middle line:84%
a savant, an autistic savant,
not a prodigy, but a savant,

00:26:44.745 --> 00:26:47.920 align:middle line:84%
had this amazing capability
of almost instantaneous

00:26:47.920 --> 00:26:50.150 align:middle line:90%
memorization of everything.

00:26:50.150 --> 00:26:52.150 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: He knew what
the rain was 10 years ago

00:26:52.150 --> 00:26:52.950 align:middle line:90%
on a certain day.

00:26:52.950 --> 00:26:55.870 align:middle line:84%
He knew what the weather
patterns were in a given area.

00:26:55.870 --> 00:26:57.588 align:middle line:84%
It was an insane
amount of knowledge.

00:26:57.588 --> 00:26:59.130 align:middle line:84%
>>JAWER: He was a
calendar calculator

00:26:59.130 --> 00:27:03.887 align:middle line:84%
and he could read things
independently with each eye.

00:27:03.887 --> 00:27:06.220 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Oh, yeah, so obviously
both of the hemispheres

00:27:06.220 --> 00:27:08.137 align:middle line:84%
were firing but independently
from each other.

00:27:08.137 --> 00:27:08.955 align:middle line:90%
Really interesting.

00:27:08.955 --> 00:27:10.580 align:middle line:84%
>>JAWER: His actual
name, the character

00:27:10.580 --> 00:27:12.622 align:middle line:84%
or the person that character
is based on his name

00:27:12.622 --> 00:27:15.160 align:middle line:90%
was named Kim Peek, Kim Peek.

00:27:15.160 --> 00:27:17.890 align:middle line:84%
But, yeah, there
are these instances

00:27:17.890 --> 00:27:20.020 align:middle line:90%
of incredible prodigies.

00:27:20.020 --> 00:27:23.160 align:middle line:84%
It raises many, many questions,
some very profound questions

00:27:23.160 --> 00:27:24.160 align:middle line:90%
about what it is to be--

00:27:24.160 --> 00:27:26.160 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: I'm really
comfortable with the notion

00:27:26.160 --> 00:27:27.650 align:middle line:84%
of continued cycles
of incarnation,

00:27:27.650 --> 00:27:29.110 align:middle line:90%
I think, well, sure.

00:27:29.110 --> 00:27:31.240 align:middle line:84%
You bring that one forward,
it's ready and loaded,

00:27:31.240 --> 00:27:33.400 align:middle line:84%
and all you have to do is
get in a little vehicle

00:27:33.400 --> 00:27:36.140 align:middle line:84%
and get some pencil, and
paper, and an instrument,

00:27:36.140 --> 00:27:39.130 align:middle line:90%
and you're ready to go.

00:27:39.130 --> 00:27:41.440 align:middle line:90%
>>JAWER: Yeah, we seem to be--

00:27:41.440 --> 00:27:45.192 align:middle line:84%
at least some of us have
access to vast potential.

00:27:45.192 --> 00:27:46.900 align:middle line:84%
And the question is--
and Darold Treffert

00:27:46.900 --> 00:27:49.720 align:middle line:84%
asks this is-- does everyone
have a little "Rain Man"

00:27:49.720 --> 00:27:51.190 align:middle line:90%
capacity within them?

00:27:51.190 --> 00:27:52.280 align:middle line:90%
That's an open question.

00:27:52.280 --> 00:27:54.700 align:middle line:84%
I mean people would
answer different ways.

00:27:54.700 --> 00:27:56.830 align:middle line:84%
But I think by looking
at these particular kinds

00:27:56.830 --> 00:28:01.310 align:middle line:84%
of exceptional kids and
other exceptional people,

00:28:01.310 --> 00:28:03.190 align:middle line:84%
we do have a sense
that maybe there

00:28:03.190 --> 00:28:07.930 align:middle line:84%
is a path from
birth and previous

00:28:07.930 --> 00:28:11.020 align:middle line:84%
that there's much more
knowledge and capability

00:28:11.020 --> 00:28:11.998 align:middle line:90%
than we could guess.

00:28:11.998 --> 00:28:13.540 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Oh, I
think that's so true.

00:28:13.540 --> 00:28:16.060 align:middle line:84%
Humans are such an
interesting species.

00:28:16.060 --> 00:28:17.890 align:middle line:90%
This is one named Mariah.

00:28:17.890 --> 00:28:20.230 align:middle line:84%
This was apparent
past-life memory.

00:28:20.230 --> 00:28:22.720 align:middle line:90%
"Mariah was 2 and 1/2 years old.

00:28:22.720 --> 00:28:25.630 align:middle line:84%
She came to her teacher
sobbing, asking her

00:28:25.630 --> 00:28:27.940 align:middle line:90%
to help her find her children."

00:28:27.940 --> 00:28:31.030 align:middle line:84%
And she named the French
village that she was from.

00:28:31.030 --> 00:28:33.250 align:middle line:84%
She described even
her own death.

00:28:33.250 --> 00:28:34.870 align:middle line:84%
Talk about this
case a little bit.

00:28:34.870 --> 00:28:39.370 align:middle line:84%
This is truly amazing as far as
thin walls and sensitivity go.

00:28:39.370 --> 00:28:43.300 align:middle line:84%
>>JAWER: Yes, this comes
from a gifted and talented

00:28:43.300 --> 00:28:47.710 align:middle line:84%
organization and accounts
of these kinds of kids.

00:28:47.710 --> 00:28:54.100 align:middle line:84%
And I believe with
Mariah, she was weeping.

00:28:54.100 --> 00:28:55.960 align:middle line:84%
The teachers were
incredibly moved

00:28:55.960 --> 00:28:58.930 align:middle line:84%
because she cared so
much for these kids,

00:28:58.930 --> 00:29:00.430 align:middle line:84%
and she didn't know
where they were.

00:29:00.430 --> 00:29:01.300 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Her kids.

00:29:01.300 --> 00:29:05.800 align:middle line:84%
>>JAWER: And it seemed to
be an accident on a wagon

00:29:05.800 --> 00:29:07.810 align:middle line:84%
or something like
that, as what I recall,

00:29:07.810 --> 00:29:10.340 align:middle line:90%
or a fire that took place.

00:29:10.340 --> 00:29:12.340 align:middle line:84%
I might be mixing up a
couple of these accounts.

00:29:12.340 --> 00:29:17.710 align:middle line:84%
But it's the emotion to
me that is paramount.

00:29:17.710 --> 00:29:22.120 align:middle line:84%
To her teachers, I remember
them saying it was her emotion.

00:29:22.120 --> 00:29:24.310 align:middle line:84%
It was the way
she cared so much.

00:29:24.310 --> 00:29:25.410 align:middle line:90%
And

00:29:25.410 --> 00:29:27.493 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: It was such a
visceral, real experience.

00:29:27.493 --> 00:29:30.680 align:middle line:84%
>>JAWER: It was such a visceral,
immediate experience for her.

00:29:30.680 --> 00:29:33.620 align:middle line:84%
And that's why I think
emotion is so critical.

00:29:33.620 --> 00:29:36.190 align:middle line:84%
So the subtitle of
"Sensitive Soul"

00:29:36.190 --> 00:29:38.650 align:middle line:84%
is "The Overlooked
Role of Emotion

00:29:38.650 --> 00:29:40.120 align:middle line:90%
in Extraordinary States."

00:29:40.120 --> 00:29:42.610 align:middle line:84%
And that's really what my
work overall is looking at

00:29:42.610 --> 00:29:44.860 align:middle line:90%
is the power of emotion.

00:29:44.860 --> 00:29:48.760 align:middle line:84%
And I believe I go so far as to
suggest that emotion is really

00:29:48.760 --> 00:29:51.910 align:middle line:84%
fundamentally what connects
us with one another,

00:29:51.910 --> 00:29:56.980 align:middle line:84%
with animals, with nature,
with whatever created us.

00:29:56.980 --> 00:30:00.490 align:middle line:84%
I would go so far as to suggest
that we live in a fundamentally

00:30:00.490 --> 00:30:02.050 align:middle line:90%
emotional universe.

00:30:02.050 --> 00:30:03.760 align:middle line:84%
So that these kinds
of experiences,

00:30:03.760 --> 00:30:08.080 align:middle line:84%
which are traumatic,
have a resonance to them.

00:30:08.080 --> 00:30:10.990 align:middle line:84%
And it tends to be
with these kids.

00:30:10.990 --> 00:30:14.530 align:middle line:84%
For example, kids that recount
past lives or someone else's

00:30:14.530 --> 00:30:16.750 align:middle line:90%
life.

00:30:16.750 --> 00:30:19.270 align:middle line:84%
It's been calculated that
of the many cases that

00:30:19.270 --> 00:30:20.350 align:middle line:90%
have been documented--

00:30:20.350 --> 00:30:24.163 align:middle line:84%
Ian Stevenson, you mentioned,
and his successor's

00:30:24.163 --> 00:30:26.080 align:middle line:84%
name Jim Tucker at the
University of Virginia.

00:30:26.080 --> 00:30:28.330 align:middle line:84%
They've done 2,500 cases
or something like this.

00:30:28.330 --> 00:30:31.720 align:middle line:84%
In 70% of them, they
involve some sort

00:30:31.720 --> 00:30:34.690 align:middle line:90%
of traumatic death or demise.

00:30:34.690 --> 00:30:38.037 align:middle line:84%
So it's the trauma and the
huge emotion that's riled up.

00:30:38.037 --> 00:30:40.120 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And it's like
the emotion ties them back

00:30:40.120 --> 00:30:42.880 align:middle line:84%
into that experience,
because those experiences can

00:30:42.880 --> 00:30:45.150 align:middle line:84%
be validated in a
lot of these cases.

00:30:45.150 --> 00:30:47.170 align:middle line:84%
I remember a few of
them, and they're just

00:30:47.170 --> 00:30:50.290 align:middle line:84%
really exceptional
where they go up and say

00:30:50.290 --> 00:30:53.350 align:middle line:84%
that's the house I used to live
in and go knock on the door.

00:30:53.350 --> 00:30:55.840 align:middle line:84%
And their old wife is
there, who's old now.

00:30:55.840 --> 00:30:57.100 align:middle line:90%
They've been dead for a while.

00:30:57.100 --> 00:30:59.860 align:middle line:84%
And they know where
their pipe is.

00:30:59.860 --> 00:31:01.630 align:middle line:84%
>>JAWER: Yes, the
emotion seems to be

00:31:01.630 --> 00:31:04.000 align:middle line:84%
the magnet, the sort
of the glue that

00:31:04.000 --> 00:31:07.390 align:middle line:84%
holds the different details
of that recollection together.

00:31:07.390 --> 00:31:09.190 align:middle line:84%
And that's what I'm
most fascinated with

00:31:09.190 --> 00:31:12.700 align:middle line:84%
is the emotion, because we
all are emotional creatures.

00:31:12.700 --> 00:31:15.370 align:middle line:84%
But I tend to think emotion is
much more profound than it's

00:31:15.370 --> 00:31:16.520 align:middle line:90%
typically given credit.

00:31:16.520 --> 00:31:17.895 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So let
me ask you this.

00:31:17.895 --> 00:31:22.120 align:middle line:84%
So in the case of Mariah looking
for her lost children so upset,

00:31:22.120 --> 00:31:23.980 align:middle line:84%
is that one of those
situations, then,

00:31:23.980 --> 00:31:26.080 align:middle line:84%
if you wanted to look at it this
way that's possible where she--

00:31:26.080 --> 00:31:27.372 align:middle line:90%
and you mentioned this earlier.

00:31:27.372 --> 00:31:28.510 align:middle line:90%
I think you alluded to it--

00:31:28.510 --> 00:31:31.210 align:middle line:84%
that she could also be
tapping into someone else's

00:31:31.210 --> 00:31:35.830 align:middle line:84%
field, someone else's emotions,
someone else's experience even?

00:31:35.830 --> 00:31:38.380 align:middle line:84%
>>JAWER: Yes, that's
entirely possible.

00:31:38.380 --> 00:31:42.235 align:middle line:84%
The term is telesomatic
experiences.

00:31:42.235 --> 00:31:44.560 align:middle line:90%
"Tele" as in distance.

00:31:44.560 --> 00:31:47.650 align:middle line:84%
"Telepathy" literally means
feeling at a distance.

00:31:47.650 --> 00:31:51.700 align:middle line:84%
Telesomatic is where
people actually feel,

00:31:51.700 --> 00:31:57.140 align:middle line:84%
literally, someone else's
pain at a distance.

00:31:57.140 --> 00:31:59.300 align:middle line:84%
So there are accounts of
these in the book as well.

00:31:59.300 --> 00:32:01.240 align:middle line:84%
And I'm sure you
and your viewers

00:32:01.240 --> 00:32:05.197 align:middle line:84%
are familiar with situations
where people feel uneasy.

00:32:05.197 --> 00:32:07.780 align:middle line:84%
Something's happened to someone
that they know and care about,

00:32:07.780 --> 00:32:09.447 align:middle line:84%
they can't quite put
their finger on it,

00:32:09.447 --> 00:32:13.870 align:middle line:84%
or maybe they can and they feel
a headache, or a stomach ache,

00:32:13.870 --> 00:32:17.050 align:middle line:84%
or they have to drop their
pen because their hand is just

00:32:17.050 --> 00:32:18.940 align:middle line:90%
completely pained.

00:32:18.940 --> 00:32:20.200 align:middle line:90%
There are these accounts.

00:32:20.200 --> 00:32:25.990 align:middle line:84%
And so it seems that emotion
can traverse time and distance.

00:32:25.990 --> 00:32:29.280 align:middle line:84%
And these telesomatic
experiences attest to that.

00:32:29.280 --> 00:32:34.150 align:middle line:84%
So it could be that that's
held in common, as you suggest,

00:32:34.150 --> 00:32:38.020 align:middle line:84%
with kids to have these
memories of someone else's life.

00:32:38.020 --> 00:32:40.370 align:middle line:84%
It's something that
happened some other time,

00:32:40.370 --> 00:32:43.015 align:middle line:84%
some other place, not
necessarily a reincarnation,

00:32:43.015 --> 00:32:44.515 align:middle line:84%
but they're picking
up on something.

00:32:44.515 --> 00:32:45.730 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: It could
be, but it may not be.

00:32:45.730 --> 00:32:46.060 align:middle line:90%
>>JAWER: It may be.

00:32:46.060 --> 00:32:46.970 align:middle line:90%
We don't know.

00:32:46.970 --> 00:32:47.770 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: OK.

00:32:47.770 --> 00:32:49.180 align:middle line:90%
And also ghosts.

00:32:49.180 --> 00:32:51.710 align:middle line:84%
Now you're starting to get over
into poltergeists and ghosts

00:32:51.710 --> 00:32:52.510 align:middle line:90%
as well.

00:32:52.510 --> 00:32:54.385 align:middle line:84%
You have a little
different perception on it.

00:32:54.385 --> 00:32:56.230 align:middle line:84%
And we talk about
Matthew Manning

00:32:56.230 --> 00:32:59.380 align:middle line:84%
because he had a poltergeist
situation with telekinesis.

00:32:59.380 --> 00:33:02.600 align:middle line:90%
Now this one's fascinating.

00:33:02.600 --> 00:33:06.280 align:middle line:84%
I've done some stories on
this phenomena including

00:33:06.280 --> 00:33:09.850 align:middle line:84%
the woman whose family
the movies "The Conjuring"

00:33:09.850 --> 00:33:12.970 align:middle line:84%
was based on and how
crazy it was at that home.

00:33:12.970 --> 00:33:16.930 align:middle line:84%
In Matthew's case, the furniture
would lift off the ground

00:33:16.930 --> 00:33:19.420 align:middle line:84%
and hurdle itself
through the air.

00:33:19.420 --> 00:33:21.820 align:middle line:84%
But then this is the
interesting part-- hundreds

00:33:21.820 --> 00:33:25.420 align:middle line:84%
of dead people's signatures
suddenly appeared on his wall

00:33:25.420 --> 00:33:27.730 align:middle line:90%
all in different handwriting.

00:33:27.730 --> 00:33:30.760 align:middle line:84%
And then he began
automatic writing

00:33:30.760 --> 00:33:32.890 align:middle line:90%
in fluent Chinese and Arabic.

00:33:32.890 --> 00:33:35.160 align:middle line:90%
So tell us about this guy.

00:33:35.160 --> 00:33:37.490 align:middle line:84%
>>JAWER: Yeah, and
he also, later on I

00:33:37.490 --> 00:33:40.820 align:middle line:84%
believe, he was able
to produce artwork

00:33:40.820 --> 00:33:43.670 align:middle line:84%
that was very reminiscent
of different English artists

00:33:43.670 --> 00:33:45.975 align:middle line:84%
from the 17th and
18th centuries.

00:33:45.975 --> 00:33:47.600 align:middle line:84%
So incredible,
incredible capabilities.

00:33:47.600 --> 00:33:48.920 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So this guy's
wide open obviously,

00:33:48.920 --> 00:33:51.540 align:middle line:84%
but what about the poltergeist
and ghost aspect of it?

00:33:51.540 --> 00:33:52.670 align:middle line:84%
Because you have a
few of those in there,

00:33:52.670 --> 00:33:54.000 align:middle line:84%
we just don't have enough
time to go over all of them.

00:33:54.000 --> 00:33:55.920 align:middle line:84%
>>JAWER: Yeah, well
I'll mention something

00:33:55.920 --> 00:33:59.270 align:middle line:84%
that happened with me which
I think is relevant and again

00:33:59.270 --> 00:34:01.880 align:middle line:90%
came out of the blue.

00:34:01.880 --> 00:34:04.430 align:middle line:84%
I remember many years
ago, 20 some years,

00:34:04.430 --> 00:34:07.740 align:middle line:84%
I was late at night and
pacing back and forth.

00:34:07.740 --> 00:34:09.971 align:middle line:84%
And I was concerned and
agitated about something.

00:34:09.971 --> 00:34:11.179 align:middle line:90%
I don't remember what it was.

00:34:11.179 --> 00:34:13.940 align:middle line:84%
But there was a light
bulb in the socket

00:34:13.940 --> 00:34:20.120 align:middle line:84%
that was on the ceiling that
just dropped, just dropped out.

00:34:20.120 --> 00:34:23.159 align:middle line:84%
And that never happened
before, never happened after.

00:34:23.159 --> 00:34:25.760 align:middle line:84%
And the convergence
of the conjunction

00:34:25.760 --> 00:34:30.420 align:middle line:84%
with me being riled up got
me to thinking about this.

00:34:30.420 --> 00:34:34.040 align:middle line:84%
So again, I think that with
a poltergeist, phenomena

00:34:34.040 --> 00:34:36.920 align:middle line:84%
and apparitions as
well, in general ghosts,

00:34:36.920 --> 00:34:42.199 align:middle line:84%
I think that there are
feelings that somehow emanate

00:34:42.199 --> 00:34:44.780 align:middle line:84%
from someone, whether
that person is there

00:34:44.780 --> 00:34:46.940 align:middle line:84%
at that moment in that
particular location

00:34:46.940 --> 00:34:49.030 align:middle line:84%
or maybe they were
there some time before.

00:34:49.030 --> 00:34:49.830 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:34:49.830 --> 00:34:51.659 align:middle line:84%
And they're
electrically charged.

00:34:51.659 --> 00:34:53.560 align:middle line:84%
I mean the emotions
have a charge to them.

00:34:53.560 --> 00:34:55.909 align:middle line:84%
>>JAWER: We talk
about them that way--

00:34:55.909 --> 00:34:57.260 align:middle line:90%
this feeling is electric.

00:34:57.260 --> 00:34:58.340 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah, exactly.

00:34:58.340 --> 00:35:00.170 align:middle line:90%
Well in that situation too--

00:35:00.170 --> 00:35:02.930 align:middle line:84%
referring back to
Andrea Perron's book--

00:35:02.930 --> 00:35:05.240 align:middle line:84%
she said when these poltergeist
activities occurred--

00:35:05.240 --> 00:35:08.060 align:middle line:84%
which some of them were
pretty horrific by the way--

00:35:08.060 --> 00:35:09.823 align:middle line:90%
this one is just fascinating.

00:35:09.823 --> 00:35:11.240 align:middle line:84%
>>JAWER: This
didn't hurt anybody.

00:35:11.240 --> 00:35:12.412 align:middle line:90%
Some of them sometimes do.

00:35:12.412 --> 00:35:14.120 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Those were
violent in her case,

00:35:14.120 --> 00:35:15.830 align:middle line:84%
especially going
after her mother.

00:35:15.830 --> 00:35:18.140 align:middle line:84%
But what happened
at the same time

00:35:18.140 --> 00:35:22.820 align:middle line:84%
is they had an old analog
electric meter would

00:35:22.820 --> 00:35:24.170 align:middle line:90%
start spinning out of control.

00:35:24.170 --> 00:35:26.600 align:middle line:84%
They'd have these
massive electric bills.

00:35:26.600 --> 00:35:28.610 align:middle line:90%
So whatever it was drawing--

00:35:28.610 --> 00:35:32.930 align:middle line:84%
whether it was an entity on
the other side or the entities

00:35:32.930 --> 00:35:35.480 align:middle line:84%
involved on this side and the
emotions that were getting

00:35:35.480 --> 00:35:38.960 align:middle line:84%
drawn into it, it was using a
tremendous, tremendous amount

00:35:38.960 --> 00:35:41.700 align:middle line:84%
of whatever ambient
electricity was around.

00:35:41.700 --> 00:35:42.500 align:middle line:90%
>>JAWER: Yeah.

00:35:42.500 --> 00:35:44.810 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: I'm thinking because
this guy with things moving,

00:35:44.810 --> 00:35:46.310 align:middle line:84%
furniture flying
through the house.

00:35:46.310 --> 00:35:50.900 align:middle line:84%
>>JAWER: Very, yes, hard to
conceive how that could happen.

00:35:50.900 --> 00:35:55.940 align:middle line:84%
There was a guy in England
in the 1980s, I believe,

00:35:55.940 --> 00:35:57.470 align:middle line:90%
who did a survey.

00:35:57.470 --> 00:36:01.730 align:middle line:84%
And he asked people about
anomalous experiences

00:36:01.730 --> 00:36:04.770 align:middle line:84%
that they'd had and
electrical sensitivity.

00:36:04.770 --> 00:36:05.570 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:36:05.570 --> 00:36:07.508 align:middle line:84%
>>JAWER: And a large
percentage of them

00:36:07.508 --> 00:36:09.300 align:middle line:84%
felt that they were
electrically sensitive,

00:36:09.300 --> 00:36:11.550 align:middle line:84%
which is what some of the
people told me way back when

00:36:11.550 --> 00:36:14.660 align:middle line:84%
I was investigating poor indoor
air quality in sick buildings

00:36:14.660 --> 00:36:15.660 align:middle line:90%
and some of these folks.

00:36:15.660 --> 00:36:19.760 align:middle line:84%
So there seems to be some sort
of overlap between emotion,

00:36:19.760 --> 00:36:23.600 align:middle line:84%
especially displaced,
dissociated feelings,

00:36:23.600 --> 00:36:25.940 align:middle line:84%
and the possibility
of them becoming

00:36:25.940 --> 00:36:29.510 align:middle line:84%
manifest in the environment
in these incredible ways that

00:36:29.510 --> 00:36:33.890 align:middle line:84%
may also borrow from
some form of electricity

00:36:33.890 --> 00:36:36.365 align:middle line:90%
to gain their momentum.

00:36:36.365 --> 00:36:37.490 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: It's fascinating.

00:36:37.490 --> 00:36:39.540 align:middle line:84%
I can say just quickly
on a personal level--

00:36:39.540 --> 00:36:41.630 align:middle line:84%
and then we'll wrap it
up here, because there's

00:36:41.630 --> 00:36:44.780 align:middle line:84%
so many more of these that
people can read in your book.

00:36:44.780 --> 00:36:47.700 align:middle line:84%
But I have a particular
condition I was born with.

00:36:47.700 --> 00:36:52.400 align:middle line:84%
And I remember this one doctor
that I go to was looking at me

00:36:52.400 --> 00:36:55.390 align:middle line:84%
and said I've never seen such
an electrical system, such

00:36:55.390 --> 00:36:57.660 align:middle line:90%
an active electrical system.

00:36:57.660 --> 00:37:00.590 align:middle line:84%
So what happens when I go into
these things, these crises,

00:37:00.590 --> 00:37:02.540 align:middle line:84%
you might call them
before passing out

00:37:02.540 --> 00:37:05.990 align:middle line:84%
or whatnot is I feel that all
the electricity is flying away

00:37:05.990 --> 00:37:06.830 align:middle line:90%
from my body.

00:37:06.830 --> 00:37:08.870 align:middle line:84%
That's how I would
actually describe it.

00:37:08.870 --> 00:37:10.250 align:middle line:90%
All the electricity is going.

00:37:10.250 --> 00:37:11.750 align:middle line:84%
And if there's
someone who knows how

00:37:11.750 --> 00:37:13.670 align:middle line:84%
to work with
electricity nearby, they

00:37:13.670 --> 00:37:18.650 align:middle line:84%
can cap the areas it escapes
our body and for all people.

00:37:18.650 --> 00:37:22.010 align:middle line:84%
And one of them is right here
at the base of the neck to trap

00:37:22.010 --> 00:37:23.540 align:middle line:84%
that in there so
it can't leak out.

00:37:23.540 --> 00:37:26.150 align:middle line:84%
And then it flies out my
fingers and everything.

00:37:26.150 --> 00:37:29.660 align:middle line:84%
But what I noticed is if
you control the emotions

00:37:29.660 --> 00:37:31.940 align:middle line:84%
and don't become
afraid at that time,

00:37:31.940 --> 00:37:34.220 align:middle line:84%
if I can control
my emotions, I can

00:37:34.220 --> 00:37:37.850 align:middle line:84%
stop the flow of the
electricity out of my body

00:37:37.850 --> 00:37:39.920 align:middle line:84%
and maybe not even
go unconscious.

00:37:39.920 --> 00:37:44.720 align:middle line:84%
But if I go into any fear at
all, the electricity flies away

00:37:44.720 --> 00:37:45.580 align:middle line:90%
and I'm out.

00:37:45.580 --> 00:37:47.330 align:middle line:84%
>>JAWER: Yes, and
that's been demonstrated

00:37:47.330 --> 00:37:48.470 align:middle line:90%
with some of the cases.

00:37:48.470 --> 00:37:51.380 align:middle line:84%
There's a guy named Bill Roll
who's probably the most famous

00:37:51.380 --> 00:37:54.320 align:middle line:84%
of the poltergeist
investigators.

00:37:54.320 --> 00:37:59.090 align:middle line:84%
And it's typically
children-- it can be adults,

00:37:59.090 --> 00:38:02.120 align:middle line:84%
but it's typically adolescents
or preadolescents that seem

00:38:02.120 --> 00:38:04.712 align:middle line:84%
to be the focus of these
poltergeist cases--

00:38:04.712 --> 00:38:06.170 align:middle line:84%
when they get
therapy and when they

00:38:06.170 --> 00:38:09.820 align:middle line:84%
are allowed to talk
about their feelings,

00:38:09.820 --> 00:38:13.110 align:middle line:84%
the intensity of the
phenomena is reduced.

00:38:13.110 --> 00:38:13.910 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:38:13.910 --> 00:38:15.390 align:middle line:90%
Yeah, it is interesting.

00:38:15.390 --> 00:38:16.580 align:middle line:90%
It's an electrical universe.

00:38:16.580 --> 00:38:18.380 align:middle line:90%
We're electrical creatures.

00:38:18.380 --> 00:38:20.930 align:middle line:84%
We're working with thoughts
that have electrical components

00:38:20.930 --> 00:38:22.080 align:middle line:90%
to them as well.

00:38:22.080 --> 00:38:25.100 align:middle line:84%
And we're working with who
knows what just beyond the veil

00:38:25.100 --> 00:38:27.810 align:middle line:84%
and who knows what from
beyond time and space.

00:38:27.810 --> 00:38:29.840 align:middle line:90%
And so you're saying it sounds--

00:38:29.840 --> 00:38:31.760 align:middle line:84%
just to sum it up a
little bit before you

00:38:31.760 --> 00:38:34.220 align:middle line:84%
have your kind of final
thoughts on this--

00:38:34.220 --> 00:38:37.660 align:middle line:84%
that when we come into the
world in a more traumatic way

00:38:37.660 --> 00:38:40.510 align:middle line:84%
or suffer very early
trauma in our lives,

00:38:40.510 --> 00:38:44.710 align:middle line:84%
it creates a dissociation that
allows us to kind of almost

00:38:44.710 --> 00:38:47.710 align:middle line:84%
be open more to these
exceptional, what you

00:38:47.710 --> 00:38:51.010 align:middle line:84%
call exceptional situations,
or talents, or skills

00:38:51.010 --> 00:38:51.940 align:middle line:90%
in this life.

00:38:51.940 --> 00:38:54.310 align:middle line:84%
>>JAWER: Yes, it doesn't seem
to be a conscious choice.

00:38:54.310 --> 00:38:56.950 align:middle line:90%
That some people have it.

00:38:56.950 --> 00:38:59.080 align:middle line:90%
Other people can develop it.

00:38:59.080 --> 00:39:00.550 align:middle line:90%
But yes, that's essentially it.

00:39:00.550 --> 00:39:02.440 align:middle line:90%
And emotion being the key.

00:39:02.440 --> 00:39:06.740 align:middle line:84%
Again, I believe that feelings
have a profundity to them.

00:39:06.740 --> 00:39:07.540 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Oh, yeah.

00:39:07.540 --> 00:39:08.620 align:middle line:84%
They're giving us a
lot of information.

00:39:08.620 --> 00:39:09.460 align:middle line:90%
>>JAWER: They're physical.

00:39:09.460 --> 00:39:10.260 align:middle line:90%
They're mental.

00:39:10.260 --> 00:39:11.410 align:middle line:90%
They're spiritual.

00:39:11.410 --> 00:39:13.780 align:middle line:10%
And I think that
feelings combine

00:39:13.780 --> 00:39:15.100 align:middle line:10%
all of those aspects of us.

00:39:15.100 --> 00:39:16.690 align:middle line:10%
So we never want to
sell our feelings short.

00:39:16.690 --> 00:39:17.490 align:middle line:10%
>>REGINA: Never.

00:39:17.490 --> 00:39:19.660 align:middle line:10%
Because they're
directly emanating also,

00:39:19.660 --> 00:39:22.120 align:middle line:10%
I believe, from the
subconscious and everything

00:39:22.120 --> 00:39:24.020 align:middle line:10%
that's ever been and
ever happened within us.

00:39:24.020 --> 00:39:26.260 align:middle line:84%
And if you have a feeling,
it's because it's either

00:39:26.260 --> 00:39:27.850 align:middle line:90%
a warning, an invitation.

00:39:27.850 --> 00:39:29.560 align:middle line:90%
There's information in there.

00:39:29.560 --> 00:39:31.840 align:middle line:84%
And so you're right, we
shouldn't-- we should never

00:39:31.840 --> 00:39:33.310 align:middle line:90%
ignore our feelings.

00:39:33.310 --> 00:39:36.460 align:middle line:84%
And I appreciate your taking the
time to study this for decades

00:39:36.460 --> 00:39:37.923 align:middle line:90%
and write a book on it.

00:39:37.923 --> 00:39:39.590 align:middle line:84%
>>JAWER: Well three
books at this point.

00:39:39.590 --> 00:39:40.757 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah, three books.

00:39:40.757 --> 00:39:43.180 align:middle line:84%
Well the one we're talking
about "Sensitive Soul."

00:39:43.180 --> 00:39:44.150 align:middle line:90%
I appreciate that.

00:39:44.150 --> 00:39:47.170 align:middle line:84%
And now which website can they
go to take the little self-test

00:39:47.170 --> 00:39:48.050 align:middle line:90%
before we sign off?

00:39:48.050 --> 00:39:49.717 align:middle line:84%
>>JAWER: Sure I'll
mention two websites.

00:39:49.717 --> 00:39:53.980 align:middle line:10%
The self-test is
www.youremotionaltype.com.

00:39:53.980 --> 00:39:55.690 align:middle line:10%
>>REGINA: Youremotionaltype.com.

00:39:55.690 --> 00:39:58.292 align:middle line:10%
>>JAWER: And then for everything
else, it's michaeljawer.com.

00:39:58.292 --> 00:39:58.930 align:middle line:10%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:39:58.930 --> 00:40:00.623 align:middle line:10%
Thank you so much,
Michael, for joining us.

00:40:00.623 --> 00:40:00.830 align:middle line:10%
Very interesting.

00:40:00.830 --> 00:40:02.020 align:middle line:10%
>>JAWER: My pleasure,
Regina, thank you.

00:40:02.020 --> 00:40:03.790 align:middle line:10%
>>REGINA: Michael
Jawer, "Sensitive Soul."

00:40:03.790 --> 00:40:05.920 align:middle line:10%
I hope this has given you
some interesting fodder

00:40:05.920 --> 00:40:07.990 align:middle line:10%
for conversations with
friends and family

00:40:07.990 --> 00:40:10.150 align:middle line:10%
about some of the experiences
you've had in life.

00:40:10.150 --> 00:40:12.930 align:middle line:84%
Again the book "Sensitive
Soul" by Michael Jawer.

00:40:12.930 --> 00:40:14.920 align:middle line:84%
Until next time, thank
you for joining us here
