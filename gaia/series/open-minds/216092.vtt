>>REGINA MEREDITH:
In many traditions,

00:00:20.580 --> 00:00:23.130 align:middle line:10%
we look to our ancestors
to give us guidance.

00:00:23.130 --> 00:00:26.400 align:middle line:10%
But what if we were
our own ancestor?

00:00:26.400 --> 00:00:28.970 align:middle line:10%
What would this mean in our
ability to heal ourselves,

00:00:28.970 --> 00:00:31.560 align:middle line:10%
not only in the present,
but in our past?

00:00:31.560 --> 00:00:34.460 align:middle line:84%
Cyndi Dale says that we need to
look no further than ourselves

00:00:34.460 --> 00:00:36.740 align:middle line:84%
when it comes to our
epigenetics and what

00:00:36.740 --> 00:00:39.600 align:middle line:84%
we bring into the world, which
is a different take on it.

00:00:39.600 --> 00:00:40.590 align:middle line:90%
Welcome back, Cyndi.

00:00:40.590 --> 00:00:41.820 align:middle line:84%
>>CYNDI DALE: It's
very nice to be here.

00:00:41.820 --> 00:00:42.510 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: I love this yellow.

00:00:42.510 --> 00:00:43.450 align:middle line:90%
It just pops.

00:00:43.450 --> 00:00:44.250 align:middle line:10%
>>DALE: Thank you.

00:00:44.250 --> 00:00:46.322 align:middle line:84%
I wore it because I
haven't worn it before.

00:00:46.322 --> 00:00:48.030 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: No, you're
a pink and blue girl

00:00:48.030 --> 00:00:49.072 align:middle line:90%
when you're here with me.

00:00:49.072 --> 00:00:50.367 align:middle line:90%
>>DALE: I am.

00:00:50.367 --> 00:00:52.950 align:middle line:10%
>>REGINA: And we're going to get
to your past in a little bit,

00:00:52.950 --> 00:00:55.290 align:middle line:10%
but I want to start out
with this wonderful story

00:00:55.290 --> 00:00:57.048 align:middle line:10%
just because it's
fun and it's cool,

00:00:57.048 --> 00:00:59.090 align:middle line:10%
and it gives people an
idea of what we're talking

00:00:59.090 --> 00:01:00.120 align:middle line:10%
about right off the bat.

00:01:00.120 --> 00:01:01.790 align:middle line:10%
This is the one
in your book that

00:01:01.790 --> 00:01:04.349 align:middle line:10%
has to do with you
and your grandmother,

00:01:04.349 --> 00:01:05.880 align:middle line:10%
and a love triangle.

00:01:05.880 --> 00:01:08.990 align:middle line:10%
>>DALE: Absolutely, which sounds
a little incestuous, but let's

00:01:08.990 --> 00:01:10.560 align:middle line:10%
just cancel that part out.

00:01:10.560 --> 00:01:11.360 align:middle line:10%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:01:11.360 --> 00:01:13.350 align:middle line:10%
>>DALE: So my mother
is from North Dakota.

00:01:13.350 --> 00:01:14.930 align:middle line:10%
We lived in Minneapolis.

00:01:14.930 --> 00:01:17.850 align:middle line:10%
And many times a year,
way too many times a year,

00:01:17.850 --> 00:01:20.630 align:middle line:10%
we would traverse over to
Watford City, North Dakota,

00:01:20.630 --> 00:01:23.550 align:middle line:10%
to see my Norwegian
grandparents,

00:01:23.550 --> 00:01:25.310 align:middle line:10%
including my grandmother Marie.

00:01:25.310 --> 00:01:28.350 align:middle line:84%
Marie Prestengen was
her original name.

00:01:28.350 --> 00:01:31.130 align:middle line:84%
And somewhere
along the line, she

00:01:31.130 --> 00:01:34.790 align:middle line:84%
started to put out this one
picture of her deceased sister

00:01:34.790 --> 00:01:36.450 align:middle line:90%
who had died in Norway.

00:01:36.450 --> 00:01:38.430 align:middle line:84%
And I looked at the
picture, Regina,

00:01:38.430 --> 00:01:40.210 align:middle line:90%
and I was like, that was me.

00:01:40.210 --> 00:01:41.010 align:middle line:90%
I was--

00:01:41.010 --> 00:01:41.570 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: How old
were you at this time?

00:01:41.570 --> 00:01:42.110 align:middle line:90%
>>DALE: 10.

00:01:42.110 --> 00:01:42.910 align:middle line:90%
10.

00:01:42.910 --> 00:01:46.560 align:middle line:84%
And I'd had other memories
and seen spirits and ghosts,

00:01:46.560 --> 00:01:50.510 align:middle line:84%
but I had never familiarized
myself with the idea.

00:01:50.510 --> 00:01:53.780 align:middle line:84%
And I knew I'd been alive
before, but in this same family?

00:01:53.780 --> 00:01:56.442 align:middle line:90%
That seemed strange to me.

00:01:56.442 --> 00:02:00.220 align:middle line:84%
And I still have that picture,
actually, which is fascinating.

00:02:00.220 --> 00:02:02.260 align:middle line:84%
So several years
later, I decided

00:02:02.260 --> 00:02:06.070 align:middle line:84%
I needed to uncover what was
this about, because I'd never,

00:02:06.070 --> 00:02:07.760 align:middle line:90%
frankly, liked my grandmother.

00:02:07.760 --> 00:02:08.990 align:middle line:90%
I'd always detested her.

00:02:08.990 --> 00:02:10.220 align:middle line:90%
We didn't get along.

00:02:10.220 --> 00:02:11.510 align:middle line:90%
She didn't like me.

00:02:11.510 --> 00:02:13.907 align:middle line:84%
I thought it was because one
time she stayed in my room

00:02:13.907 --> 00:02:15.490 align:middle line:84%
and there were frogs
in there and they

00:02:15.490 --> 00:02:17.570 align:middle line:84%
escaped because I'd
been collecting them.

00:02:17.570 --> 00:02:19.010 align:middle line:90%
But it was more than that.

00:02:19.010 --> 00:02:24.310 align:middle line:84%
So I did a regression in my 30s
and discovered that I was not

00:02:24.310 --> 00:02:29.390 align:middle line:84%
really supposed to die when
I was a teenager in Norway.

00:02:29.390 --> 00:02:32.170 align:middle line:84%
In fact, it looked like
my grandmother maybe

00:02:32.170 --> 00:02:36.830 align:middle line:84%
was the karmic one to have
perhaps pulled that short straw.

00:02:36.830 --> 00:02:38.010 align:middle line:90%
But I died.

00:02:38.010 --> 00:02:38.810 align:middle line:90%
She didn't.

00:02:38.810 --> 00:02:41.120 align:middle line:90%
She came over to America.

00:02:41.120 --> 00:02:44.500 align:middle line:84%
But my soul was
like, Cyndi, you were

00:02:44.500 --> 00:02:46.100 align:middle line:90%
supposed to come to America.

00:02:46.100 --> 00:02:48.140 align:middle line:84%
You were supposed to
become that nurse.

00:02:48.140 --> 00:02:52.460 align:middle line:84%
You were supposed to meet Olaf,
who became Marie's husband,

00:02:52.460 --> 00:02:54.680 align:middle line:84%
and that was supposed
to be your partner.

00:02:54.680 --> 00:02:58.330 align:middle line:84%
So it was like, this is why
I never liked my grandmother.

00:02:58.330 --> 00:02:59.240 align:middle line:90%
This is why I adore--

00:02:59.240 --> 00:03:00.490 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: She stole your life.

00:03:00.490 --> 00:03:01.290 align:middle line:90%
She stole your man.

00:03:01.290 --> 00:03:02.440 align:middle line:90%
>>DALE: She stole my life.

00:03:02.440 --> 00:03:04.600 align:middle line:90%
My entire life.

00:03:04.600 --> 00:03:07.000 align:middle line:90%
And Olaf was a hoot.

00:03:07.000 --> 00:03:11.010 align:middle line:84%
I mean, he drank blackberry
liqueur like nobody's business.

00:03:11.010 --> 00:03:12.010 align:middle line:90%
He would sneak it to us.

00:03:12.010 --> 00:03:13.980 align:middle line:84%
He hid it under the couch
and would sneak it to us.

00:03:13.980 --> 00:03:14.740 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: When you were kids.

00:03:14.740 --> 00:03:15.340 align:middle line:90%
>>DALE: When we were kids.

00:03:15.340 --> 00:03:16.965 align:middle line:84%
I know that's not
quite the right thing

00:03:16.965 --> 00:03:20.220 align:middle line:84%
to do if you're in an
alcoholic family system,

00:03:20.220 --> 00:03:23.680 align:middle line:84%
but there's reasons this is an
alcoholic family system as well.

00:03:23.680 --> 00:03:26.430 align:middle line:84%
But I was shocked and
it made so much sense

00:03:26.430 --> 00:03:28.860 align:middle line:84%
that that was why I
had always just, like,

00:03:28.860 --> 00:03:30.450 align:middle line:90%
glared at my grandmother.

00:03:30.450 --> 00:03:33.970 align:middle line:84%
And my mother would be like,
you need to be nicer to her.

00:03:33.970 --> 00:03:34.870 align:middle line:90%
And I'm like, what?

00:03:34.870 --> 00:03:35.920 align:middle line:90%
I'm not saying anything.

00:03:35.920 --> 00:03:37.000 align:middle line:90%
She goes, exactly.

00:03:37.000 --> 00:03:38.250 align:middle line:90%
You don't talk to her.

00:03:38.250 --> 00:03:39.550 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: But she
didn't like you either.

00:03:39.550 --> 00:03:40.840 align:middle line:84%
>>DALE: No, she
didn't like me at all.

00:03:40.840 --> 00:03:42.240 align:middle line:90%
She was always picking at me.

00:03:42.240 --> 00:03:44.350 align:middle line:84%
She was always saying, you
shouldn't do your hair this way.

00:03:44.350 --> 00:03:45.130 align:middle line:90%
You should wear this.

00:03:45.130 --> 00:03:46.330 align:middle line:90%
You shouldn't be like that.

00:03:46.330 --> 00:03:47.130 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:03:47.130 --> 00:03:51.090 align:middle line:84%
>>DALE: It was one of
those karmic dislikes that

00:03:51.090 --> 00:03:52.330 align:middle line:90%
was just there in the get-go.

00:03:52.330 --> 00:03:53.130 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:03:53.130 --> 00:03:57.420 align:middle line:84%
>>DALE: What's been wonderful,
though, in my work as an energy

00:03:57.420 --> 00:04:00.420 align:middle line:84%
healer, is that
opened me up to start

00:04:00.420 --> 00:04:02.560 align:middle line:90%
asking more unusual questions.

00:04:02.560 --> 00:04:06.520 align:middle line:84%
What if so many of us have
been in our own ancestor bed?

00:04:06.520 --> 00:04:08.890 align:middle line:84%
We're going to have a
double issue that way.

00:04:08.890 --> 00:04:11.280 align:middle line:90%
Double gift, double challenge.

00:04:11.280 --> 00:04:13.260 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: True.

00:04:13.260 --> 00:04:15.000 align:middle line:84%
Well, that's such
a big conversation

00:04:15.000 --> 00:04:16.690 align:middle line:84%
and that's my
understanding of it.

00:04:16.690 --> 00:04:20.170 align:middle line:84%
Honestly, in terms of
reincarnation patterns,

00:04:20.170 --> 00:04:24.600 align:middle line:84%
we generally will
tend to incarnate back

00:04:24.600 --> 00:04:28.600 align:middle line:84%
into the same bloodline, but
it's for practical reasons

00:04:28.600 --> 00:04:29.800 align:middle line:90%
more than anything.

00:04:29.800 --> 00:04:31.210 align:middle line:90%
We're familiar with it.

00:04:31.210 --> 00:04:33.750 align:middle line:84%
We've already created a little
bit of either fun or karma

00:04:33.750 --> 00:04:35.340 align:middle line:90%
with someone in that bloodline.

00:04:35.340 --> 00:04:38.243 align:middle line:84%
That's being-- as you know,
through epigenetics, all that's

00:04:38.243 --> 00:04:39.660 align:middle line:84%
being passed down
to us and we get

00:04:39.660 --> 00:04:42.410 align:middle line:84%
to keep working it out
with each other, right?

00:04:42.410 --> 00:04:43.210 align:middle line:90%
>>DALE: We do.

00:04:43.210 --> 00:04:44.740 align:middle line:84%
We get to mix that
soup up again.

00:04:44.740 --> 00:04:45.540 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:04:45.540 --> 00:04:49.140 align:middle line:10%
>>DALE: And hopefully become
a better version of ourselves

00:04:49.140 --> 00:04:52.170 align:middle line:10%
each time, hopefully
lean a little bit more

00:04:52.170 --> 00:04:54.370 align:middle line:10%
into forgiveness
and understanding,

00:04:54.370 --> 00:04:56.920 align:middle line:10%
not just of the others,
but of ourselves too.

00:04:56.920 --> 00:04:58.950 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Yeah, and then
hopefully at that time

00:04:58.950 --> 00:05:01.750 align:middle line:84%
you can hop bloodlines,
try something different,

00:05:01.750 --> 00:05:03.250 align:middle line:84%
learn a different
set of lessons,

00:05:03.250 --> 00:05:05.670 align:middle line:84%
create karma with
all new people.

00:05:05.670 --> 00:05:07.450 align:middle line:84%
>>DALE: Well, I'm a
big believer in that.

00:05:07.450 --> 00:05:09.660 align:middle line:10%
It's not just about
undoing history

00:05:09.660 --> 00:05:13.240 align:middle line:10%
or reactivating positive
histories or traits,

00:05:13.240 --> 00:05:14.920 align:middle line:10%
but what are we passing down?

00:05:14.920 --> 00:05:17.470 align:middle line:84%
How do we become
our own ancestor?

00:05:17.470 --> 00:05:18.750 align:middle line:90%
I think we can.

00:05:18.750 --> 00:05:23.860 align:middle line:84%
Not to some wild way
of approaching it,

00:05:23.860 --> 00:05:28.500 align:middle line:84%
not in an impractical way,
but I can redesign my present

00:05:28.500 --> 00:05:30.340 align:middle line:90%
so I can change my future.

00:05:30.340 --> 00:05:33.400 align:middle line:84%
And I know as a mother,
and now a grandmother,

00:05:33.400 --> 00:05:34.630 align:middle line:90%
I do have to brag on that.

00:05:34.630 --> 00:05:35.280 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Congrats.

00:05:35.280 --> 00:05:36.080 align:middle line:90%
>>DALE: Thank you.

00:05:36.080 --> 00:05:39.400 align:middle line:84%
What I shift in myself,
I see a peer in my sons.

00:05:39.400 --> 00:05:43.000 align:middle line:84%
How I change, some of
their issues disappear.

00:05:43.000 --> 00:05:46.260 align:middle line:84%
Some of what's been a
challenge for me and them,

00:05:46.260 --> 00:05:49.590 align:middle line:84%
because it may as likely
have passed down from me

00:05:49.590 --> 00:05:53.150 align:middle line:84%
and/or come in with their
soul, but I've doubled on it,

00:05:53.150 --> 00:05:55.680 align:middle line:84%
it starts to clear
up their lives too.

00:05:55.680 --> 00:05:57.720 align:middle line:90%
So we just want to improve.

00:05:57.720 --> 00:05:58.980 align:middle line:90%
We want to get better.

00:05:58.980 --> 00:05:59.910 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: We do.

00:05:59.910 --> 00:06:03.030 align:middle line:10%
And we're starting to learn
through many different lenses

00:06:03.030 --> 00:06:08.090 align:middle line:10%
now that time and space,
of course, are an illusion.

00:06:08.090 --> 00:06:12.845 align:middle line:84%
And so looking at it
more like a Möbius loop,

00:06:12.845 --> 00:06:15.000 align:middle line:90%
we have the ability to do that.

00:06:15.000 --> 00:06:18.930 align:middle line:84%
And I'm hearing from different
authors and different subjects

00:06:18.930 --> 00:06:20.990 align:middle line:84%
the same thing about
healing our past

00:06:20.990 --> 00:06:23.840 align:middle line:84%
as we heal ourselves now, which
heals our ancestors, which

00:06:23.840 --> 00:06:24.690 align:middle line:90%
makes sense.

00:06:24.690 --> 00:06:29.640 align:middle line:84%
If we're incarnating into these
same bloodlines as the norm.

00:06:29.640 --> 00:06:31.310 align:middle line:84%
>>DALE: It is typically
because it tends

00:06:31.310 --> 00:06:32.870 align:middle line:90%
to have to do with soul group.

00:06:32.870 --> 00:06:33.670 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:06:33.670 --> 00:06:35.450 align:middle line:84%
>>DALE: And it is
interesting when we talk

00:06:35.450 --> 00:06:36.990 align:middle line:90%
about the different lenses.

00:06:36.990 --> 00:06:40.170 align:middle line:10%
I love the scientific lens,
especially quantum physics,

00:06:40.170 --> 00:06:42.050 align:middle line:10%
biology as well.

00:06:42.050 --> 00:06:44.540 align:middle line:84%
But so much of the
current research

00:06:44.540 --> 00:06:46.820 align:middle line:84%
is pointing to the
universe itself

00:06:46.820 --> 00:06:48.810 align:middle line:90%
being divine intelligence.

00:06:48.810 --> 00:06:50.990 align:middle line:84%
It actually stores data
in geometric forms.

00:06:50.990 --> 00:06:51.790 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:06:51.790 --> 00:06:55.210 align:middle line:84%
>>DALE: And what we're
holding the strongest

00:06:55.210 --> 00:06:58.120 align:middle line:84%
tends to be where our
consciousness goes

00:06:58.120 --> 00:06:59.630 align:middle line:90%
and what we create form.

00:06:59.630 --> 00:07:03.250 align:middle line:84%
Now, I would never,
ever blame anybody

00:07:03.250 --> 00:07:05.450 align:middle line:84%
for having been
abused as a child.

00:07:05.450 --> 00:07:08.120 align:middle line:84%
We're a mess down here
and there's chaos,

00:07:08.120 --> 00:07:10.270 align:middle line:84%
and there's a lot
of plans that I

00:07:10.270 --> 00:07:12.850 align:middle line:84%
think can go awry
between when we're

00:07:12.850 --> 00:07:18.820 align:middle line:84%
up there creating our journey
ways and when we get down here.

00:07:18.820 --> 00:07:22.210 align:middle line:84%
But what's so positive is
that what we do clear--

00:07:22.210 --> 00:07:26.800 align:middle line:84%
clears backward, clears
sideways and clears forward.

00:07:26.800 --> 00:07:32.230 align:middle line:84%
What we activate from back then
that is a beautiful gift, that's

00:07:32.230 --> 00:07:36.700 align:middle line:84%
a talent, that's a bit
of knowledge or wisdom,

00:07:36.700 --> 00:07:38.157 align:middle line:90%
can come forward as well.

00:07:38.157 --> 00:07:38.990 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: I love it.

00:07:38.990 --> 00:07:42.820 align:middle line:84%
So we have a lot at
our disposal when

00:07:42.820 --> 00:07:46.060 align:middle line:84%
we're looking at going into
the past and healing the past

00:07:46.060 --> 00:07:47.960 align:middle line:84%
and what that's going
to bring forward in us.

00:07:47.960 --> 00:07:51.200 align:middle line:84%
But also, there are some
complications with that as well.

00:07:51.200 --> 00:07:54.830 align:middle line:84%
And the subject of epigenetics
itself can be very confusing.

00:07:54.830 --> 00:07:57.890 align:middle line:84%
Looking through this lens,
who are you bringing forward?

00:07:57.890 --> 00:07:59.080 align:middle line:90%
Are you bringing you?

00:07:59.080 --> 00:08:01.160 align:middle line:84%
Are you bringing your
grandmother forward?

00:08:01.160 --> 00:08:02.240 align:middle line:90%
What's happening here?

00:08:02.240 --> 00:08:06.220 align:middle line:84%
So let's talk about the
beauty and challenge of being

00:08:06.220 --> 00:08:08.050 align:middle line:84%
able to heal both
forward and backward,

00:08:08.050 --> 00:08:09.680 align:middle line:90%
and what's at our disposal.

00:08:09.680 --> 00:08:10.480 align:middle line:90%
>>DALE: Absolutely.

00:08:10.480 --> 00:08:14.980 align:middle line:84%
So the discussion of epigenetics
and particular the chemical

00:08:14.980 --> 00:08:19.700 align:middle line:84%
soup of our epigenome, I'll just
go into that for a few minutes.

00:08:19.700 --> 00:08:20.500 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Do.

00:08:20.500 --> 00:08:23.060 align:middle line:84%
>>DALE: It's a chemical
soup around our genes,

00:08:23.060 --> 00:08:25.960 align:middle line:84%
the regular genes we
learned about in school that

00:08:25.960 --> 00:08:30.490 align:middle line:84%
can turn on or off and
influence what we like to eat,

00:08:30.490 --> 00:08:32.270 align:middle line:90%
what color our hair is.

00:08:32.270 --> 00:08:36.159 align:middle line:84%
L'Oreal does a great job
of that, too, of course.

00:08:36.159 --> 00:08:37.990 align:middle line:84%
But it's the
epigenome, and there's

00:08:37.990 --> 00:08:43.280 align:middle line:84%
250 different types of this
chemical soup in the body.

00:08:43.280 --> 00:08:46.980 align:middle line:84%
It basically holds
the chemistry that's

00:08:46.980 --> 00:08:49.420 align:middle line:84%
encoded with our
ancestral memories,

00:08:49.420 --> 00:08:51.810 align:middle line:84%
what our ancestors
went through, what

00:08:51.810 --> 00:08:55.640 align:middle line:84%
their emotional reactions were,
what some of their conclusions

00:08:55.640 --> 00:08:56.440 align:middle line:90%
were.

00:08:56.440 --> 00:08:59.800 align:middle line:10%
I first tuned in to this
study several years ago,

00:08:59.800 --> 00:09:02.640 align:middle line:10%
probably 20 or 30 years
ago, with the studies

00:09:02.640 --> 00:09:06.090 align:middle line:10%
of a Dr. Michael Meaney,
who was figuring out

00:09:06.090 --> 00:09:09.600 align:middle line:10%
what a lot of people
with autoimmune disorders

00:09:09.600 --> 00:09:11.160 align:middle line:10%
are trying to work on.

00:09:11.160 --> 00:09:12.510 align:middle line:90%
How are we methylating?

00:09:12.510 --> 00:09:14.440 align:middle line:90%
What's happening with our DNA?

00:09:14.440 --> 00:09:16.980 align:middle line:84%
I mean-- and it
was all a really--

00:09:16.980 --> 00:09:19.900 align:middle line:84%
he was saying that the
secret is in the epigenome.

00:09:19.900 --> 00:09:23.130 align:middle line:84%
What's getting triggered
in those chemicals

00:09:23.130 --> 00:09:26.200 align:middle line:84%
is going to influence your
genes, your behaviors,

00:09:26.200 --> 00:09:29.070 align:middle line:84%
your cravings, your
personality, what microbes

00:09:29.070 --> 00:09:30.810 align:middle line:90%
grow in your body, et cetera.

00:09:30.810 --> 00:09:33.900 align:middle line:84%
The positive part,
and way back then he

00:09:33.900 --> 00:09:37.170 align:middle line:84%
was figuring this out,
is your epigenetics are

00:09:37.170 --> 00:09:39.390 align:middle line:84%
going to work against
you if you grow up

00:09:39.390 --> 00:09:43.140 align:middle line:84%
in, say, an abusive
childhood or you're exposed

00:09:43.140 --> 00:09:45.897 align:middle line:90%
to chemicals, radioactivity--

00:09:45.897 --> 00:09:46.980 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Extreme poverty.

00:09:46.980 --> 00:09:48.090 align:middle line:90%
>>DALE: Extreme poverty.

00:09:48.090 --> 00:09:50.550 align:middle line:84%
All of that gets triggered
in the epigenome,

00:09:50.550 --> 00:09:52.400 align:middle line:90%
that becomes our programming.

00:09:52.400 --> 00:09:54.150 align:middle line:90%
That programs are neurology.

00:09:54.150 --> 00:09:55.710 align:middle line:90%
That programs are vagus nerve.

00:09:55.710 --> 00:10:00.180 align:middle line:84%
That programs how we are and
how we perceive the world.

00:10:00.180 --> 00:10:03.600 align:middle line:84%
But if you change
what's inside of you,

00:10:03.600 --> 00:10:07.590 align:middle line:84%
if you alter what's outside
of you to be more positive,

00:10:07.590 --> 00:10:09.870 align:middle line:90%
the epigenome changes.

00:10:09.870 --> 00:10:11.820 align:middle line:90%
Different of those codes--

00:10:11.820 --> 00:10:13.350 align:middle line:90%
they used to call it junk DNA.

00:10:13.350 --> 00:10:14.300 align:middle line:90%
They don't anymore.

00:10:14.300 --> 00:10:18.110 align:middle line:84%
Different of those codes turn
on the more negative turn off.

00:10:18.110 --> 00:10:21.480 align:middle line:84%
Your vulnerability to
different diseases can go down.

00:10:21.480 --> 00:10:24.300 align:middle line:84%
Your more optimistic
attitudes can go up.

00:10:24.300 --> 00:10:25.320 align:middle line:90%
Your health changes.

00:10:25.320 --> 00:10:26.690 align:middle line:90%
Your life changes.

00:10:26.690 --> 00:10:30.510 align:middle line:90%
Love is probably the real key.

00:10:30.510 --> 00:10:33.770 align:middle line:84%
If you're exposed to more
love, a more loving environment

00:10:33.770 --> 00:10:36.590 align:middle line:84%
internally and
externally, that is

00:10:36.590 --> 00:10:42.020 align:middle line:84%
most likely what influences
the most toward growth.

00:10:42.020 --> 00:10:46.220 align:middle line:84%
But healthier food, healthier
people to be around, all of that

00:10:46.220 --> 00:10:47.900 align:middle line:90%
is influential.

00:10:47.900 --> 00:10:51.210 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: I mean, as
influential as our DNA is,

00:10:51.210 --> 00:10:53.393 align:middle line:84%
so is what we've
chosen after birth

00:10:53.393 --> 00:10:55.310 align:middle line:84%
and what we choose to
surround ourselves with,

00:10:55.310 --> 00:10:56.610 align:middle line:90%
the quality of our thoughts.

00:10:56.610 --> 00:10:57.660 align:middle line:90%
And we know this.

00:10:57.660 --> 00:11:00.780 align:middle line:10%
And, of course, Bruce
Lipton's groundbreaking work,

00:11:00.780 --> 00:11:02.840 align:middle line:10%
The Biology of
Belief, I really think

00:11:02.840 --> 00:11:06.308 align:middle line:10%
that's where people first became
aware of what was possible.

00:11:06.308 --> 00:11:08.600 align:middle line:10%
I assume that you were exposed
to that at the same time

00:11:08.600 --> 00:11:10.920 align:middle line:10%
I was when it first
came off the presses.

00:11:10.920 --> 00:11:12.090 align:middle line:90%
>>DALE: It's miraculous.

00:11:12.090 --> 00:11:15.840 align:middle line:84%
And we know that thoughts
are electrical in the body.

00:11:15.840 --> 00:11:20.300 align:middle line:84%
So if you start to alter what
you do expose yourself to,

00:11:20.300 --> 00:11:23.600 align:middle line:84%
how you talk to yourself,
it's grueling work.

00:11:23.600 --> 00:11:24.750 align:middle line:90%
It's grueling.

00:11:24.750 --> 00:11:28.820 align:middle line:84%
Sometimes it pops really fast,
but it does take some real focus

00:11:28.820 --> 00:11:29.730 align:middle line:90%
as well.

00:11:29.730 --> 00:11:31.860 align:middle line:90%
Your electrical system changes.

00:11:31.860 --> 00:11:33.390 align:middle line:90%
We are electrical.

00:11:33.390 --> 00:11:35.400 align:middle line:84%
We are electrical
magnetic beings.

00:11:35.400 --> 00:11:37.140 align:middle line:90%
We are sound beings.

00:11:37.140 --> 00:11:39.390 align:middle line:84%
Everything we are is just
fields of light and sound.

00:11:39.390 --> 00:11:40.190 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:11:40.190 --> 00:11:43.410 align:middle line:84%
>>DALE: So what comes out of
us, what's off of us-- we're

00:11:43.410 --> 00:11:44.210 align:middle line:90%
just fields.

00:11:44.210 --> 00:11:45.293 align:middle line:90%
We don't really have skin.

00:11:45.293 --> 00:11:46.510 align:middle line:90%
Not really.

00:11:46.510 --> 00:11:50.140 align:middle line:84%
But then what comes
off of us is imprinted

00:11:50.140 --> 00:11:55.750 align:middle line:84%
more uniquely and positively,
and harmoniously, so

00:11:55.750 --> 00:12:00.375 align:middle line:84%
naturally what we attract to
us is more like that as well.

00:12:00.375 --> 00:12:01.750 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And as
you said, it can

00:12:01.750 --> 00:12:04.460 align:middle line:84%
be hard to parse out what your
grandma's and what's yours.

00:12:04.460 --> 00:12:05.752 align:middle line:90%
>>DALE: I don't know if we can.

00:12:05.752 --> 00:12:07.543 align:middle line:10%
>>REGINA: I don't know
that you can either.

00:12:07.543 --> 00:12:10.210 align:middle line:84%
You show up, there you are or,
in your case, your grandmother's

00:12:10.210 --> 00:12:12.190 align:middle line:90%
sister, and what's yours.

00:12:12.190 --> 00:12:13.550 align:middle line:90%
Because it's one and the same.

00:12:13.550 --> 00:12:16.750 align:middle line:84%
It's a continuation that has
this soul imprint coming in.

00:12:16.750 --> 00:12:19.850 align:middle line:84%
And using the level
of consciousness,

00:12:19.850 --> 00:12:23.560 align:middle line:84%
how the family's progressed in
terms of their emotional body

00:12:23.560 --> 00:12:28.300 align:middle line:84%
and mass, their experiences, you
come back into that gene pool

00:12:28.300 --> 00:12:31.040 align:middle line:84%
and now you have a different
opportunity in different times,

00:12:31.040 --> 00:12:33.570 align:middle line:84%
but you still have the imprint
of your grandma's sister.

00:12:33.570 --> 00:12:34.370 align:middle line:90%
>>DALE: I still do.

00:12:34.370 --> 00:12:35.450 align:middle line:90%
We don't lose.

00:12:35.450 --> 00:12:37.430 align:middle line:84%
We just try to turn
it and transform it.

00:12:37.430 --> 00:12:38.230 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:12:38.230 --> 00:12:39.310 align:middle line:90%
>>DALE: Is what we do.

00:12:39.310 --> 00:12:40.110 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:12:40.110 --> 00:12:42.850 align:middle line:84%
>>DALE: And typically our
soul does show up, I believe,

00:12:42.850 --> 00:12:44.920 align:middle line:90%
within the same ballpark.

00:12:44.920 --> 00:12:46.660 align:middle line:90%
I've been Norwegian many times.

00:12:46.660 --> 00:12:48.900 align:middle line:90%
I'm good at the stubbornness.

00:12:48.900 --> 00:12:52.110 align:middle line:10%
My favorite past
life, however, and I

00:12:52.110 --> 00:12:55.830 align:middle line:10%
say this with a grain of salt,
was as a Chinese warlord.

00:12:55.830 --> 00:12:56.890 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Oh, OK.

00:12:56.890 --> 00:12:57.180 align:middle line:90%
>>DALE: I was--

00:12:57.180 --> 00:12:59.020 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: You broke gene
pools for a minute there.

00:12:59.020 --> 00:12:59.470 align:middle line:90%
>>DALE: I did.

00:12:59.470 --> 00:13:00.860 align:middle line:90%
I was very good at being bad.

00:13:00.860 --> 00:13:03.660 align:middle line:90%


00:13:03.660 --> 00:13:05.590 align:middle line:90%
The worst part was I liked it.

00:13:05.590 --> 00:13:08.250 align:middle line:84%
So I think I had to
come back a few times

00:13:08.250 --> 00:13:11.350 align:middle line:84%
and have a few bad things
to go through to go,

00:13:11.350 --> 00:13:15.270 align:middle line:84%
oh, it doesn't feel so good on
the other end, does it, Cyndi?

00:13:15.270 --> 00:13:17.230 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Yeah,
that's interesting.

00:13:17.230 --> 00:13:19.990 align:middle line:84%
So you picked up a little
karma when you jumped pools.

00:13:19.990 --> 00:13:22.270 align:middle line:84%
You came back and now
you're continuing on.

00:13:22.270 --> 00:13:26.230 align:middle line:10%
Oh, here, one thing you say
is that the chakra below us,

00:13:26.230 --> 00:13:28.410 align:middle line:10%
which is the one you
call the 10th chakra--

00:13:28.410 --> 00:13:30.160 align:middle line:10%
we're going to get
into the chakra system,

00:13:30.160 --> 00:13:32.570 align:middle line:10%
but you've written some
beautiful books on the chakra

00:13:32.570 --> 00:13:33.370 align:middle line:10%
system.

00:13:33.370 --> 00:13:34.740 align:middle line:84%
I think that's what
we did last time.

00:13:34.740 --> 00:13:35.290 align:middle line:90%
>>DALE: We did.

00:13:35.290 --> 00:13:36.490 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Yeah,
we did last time.

00:13:36.490 --> 00:13:37.300 align:middle line:90%
Beautiful book.

00:13:37.300 --> 00:13:41.950 align:middle line:10%
So the chakra below is what
you call the 10th chakra.

00:13:41.950 --> 00:13:42.990 align:middle line:90%
We'll get into that.

00:13:42.990 --> 00:13:45.580 align:middle line:84%
Kind of doesn't make
sense, but it does to you.

00:13:45.580 --> 00:13:46.600 align:middle line:90%
>>DALE: It does to me.

00:13:46.600 --> 00:13:50.770 align:middle line:84%
So there's my logic being
imprinted in many books.

00:13:50.770 --> 00:13:54.600 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: OK, so let's talk
about that chakra, how that

00:13:54.600 --> 00:13:57.040 align:middle line:84%
feeds into all of
the epigenetics,

00:13:57.040 --> 00:13:59.110 align:middle line:84%
memory, storage of
memory, et cetera.

00:13:59.110 --> 00:14:00.580 align:middle line:90%
>>DALE: I'm excited to do that.

00:14:00.580 --> 00:14:04.710 align:middle line:84%
So many systems call it the
earth chakra or the earth star

00:14:04.710 --> 00:14:05.610 align:middle line:90%
chakra.

00:14:05.610 --> 00:14:08.290 align:middle line:84%
So that's also
another name for it.

00:14:08.290 --> 00:14:11.250 align:middle line:90%
And it is the grounding chakra.

00:14:11.250 --> 00:14:15.670 align:middle line:84%
It's actually about 2
feet under our own feet,

00:14:15.670 --> 00:14:19.470 align:middle line:84%
so people can tend to feel it if
they really focus on their feet,

00:14:19.470 --> 00:14:21.070 align:middle line:90%
go a little lower.

00:14:21.070 --> 00:14:23.830 align:middle line:84%
It opens to the rest of
the earth and the cosmos,

00:14:23.830 --> 00:14:25.770 align:middle line:90%
but it is underneath the feet.

00:14:25.770 --> 00:14:29.290 align:middle line:84%
And it has two basic,
very important functions.

00:14:29.290 --> 00:14:31.840 align:middle line:10%
One is to anchor
us in the earth,

00:14:31.840 --> 00:14:33.490 align:middle line:10%
but the earth is
part of the cosmos,

00:14:33.490 --> 00:14:36.690 align:middle line:10%
so it also connects us to
the planets and the stars.

00:14:36.690 --> 00:14:41.150 align:middle line:84%
It is the brain, if you
would, of our family genetics.

00:14:41.150 --> 00:14:44.210 align:middle line:84%
During preconception,
I believe this chakra

00:14:44.210 --> 00:14:48.030 align:middle line:84%
is very active and working
with our soul, our spirit.

00:14:48.030 --> 00:14:51.500 align:middle line:84%
There's a committee of cells
that are maybe helpers that

00:14:51.500 --> 00:14:53.280 align:middle line:90%
are involved in the process.

00:14:53.280 --> 00:14:57.140 align:middle line:84%
I believe that chakra is
very influential in helping

00:14:57.140 --> 00:15:00.020 align:middle line:84%
to decide, oh, what's
going to happen

00:15:00.020 --> 00:15:02.540 align:middle line:90%
with the epigenetic material?

00:15:02.540 --> 00:15:06.080 align:middle line:84%
What chemicals are we going
to preserve on the sperm

00:15:06.080 --> 00:15:07.230 align:middle line:90%
and on the egg?

00:15:07.230 --> 00:15:10.190 align:middle line:84%
And I think that's
a perspective that's

00:15:10.190 --> 00:15:14.270 align:middle line:84%
helpful to have because there's
a lot on there that can lead

00:15:14.270 --> 00:15:19.774 align:middle line:84%
to a lot of negativity,
illnesses, diseases, addictions,

00:15:19.774 --> 00:15:24.960 align:middle line:84%
problematic attitudes,
lifestyle challenges, et cetera.

00:15:24.960 --> 00:15:28.880 align:middle line:84%
But there's also always like
Pandora's Box, the positive,

00:15:28.880 --> 00:15:30.150 align:middle line:90%
what's hopeful.

00:15:30.150 --> 00:15:34.140 align:middle line:84%
And so the answers are
also in the epigenetics.

00:15:34.140 --> 00:15:37.040 align:middle line:84%
Back there, there's going to
have been an ancestor and/or

00:15:37.040 --> 00:15:40.580 align:middle line:84%
ourself and a soul life,
maybe as an ancestor, that

00:15:40.580 --> 00:15:45.830 align:middle line:84%
will have conquered a challenge
or have that gift that can open

00:15:45.830 --> 00:15:49.050 align:middle line:84%
up and now we can be the
classical pianist again

00:15:49.050 --> 00:15:51.570 align:middle line:84%
that can help us make our
way through the world.

00:15:51.570 --> 00:15:56.640 align:middle line:10%
And that's encoded in the 10th
chakra, which our consciousness,

00:15:56.640 --> 00:15:59.360 align:middle line:10%
if you would, helps influence.

00:15:59.360 --> 00:16:01.643 align:middle line:10%
The bone marrow is very
involved with the 10th chakra.

00:16:01.643 --> 00:16:03.060 align:middle line:10%
>>REGINA: Yes,
tell us about that.

00:16:03.060 --> 00:16:05.280 align:middle line:84%
>>DALE: Well, it's
a hormone system.

00:16:05.280 --> 00:16:08.000 align:middle line:84%
People don't know that the
bone marrow is actually

00:16:08.000 --> 00:16:09.300 align:middle line:90%
an endocrine gland.

00:16:09.300 --> 00:16:12.290 align:middle line:84%
It produces many
types of hormones

00:16:12.290 --> 00:16:14.430 align:middle line:90%
and is impacted by them.

00:16:14.430 --> 00:16:17.450 align:middle line:84%
One of the hormones
is osteocalcin

00:16:17.450 --> 00:16:21.960 align:middle line:84%
that is very involved with our
first reaction to a stressor.

00:16:21.960 --> 00:16:24.750 align:middle line:84%
Could be what we think of
as a really cool thing,

00:16:24.750 --> 00:16:28.490 align:middle line:84%
but it overwhelms us, or a
really challenging event, that,

00:16:28.490 --> 00:16:30.600 align:middle line:90%
oh, is very frightening.

00:16:30.600 --> 00:16:34.210 align:middle line:84%
But that osteocalcin
comes aboard very early

00:16:34.210 --> 00:16:38.980 align:middle line:84%
and then in turn turns
on maybe the adrenaline

00:16:38.980 --> 00:16:41.690 align:middle line:84%
in our sympathetic
nervous system.

00:16:41.690 --> 00:16:45.650 align:middle line:84%
And my own theory is,
wow, that's bone marrow.

00:16:45.650 --> 00:16:47.950 align:middle line:84%
A lot of this stuff is made
in the bone marrow that

00:16:47.950 --> 00:16:51.430 align:middle line:84%
creates different kind of
illnesses and opportunities

00:16:51.430 --> 00:16:52.280 align:middle line:90%
as well.

00:16:52.280 --> 00:16:55.720 align:middle line:84%
But how much of that
instant reaction to stress

00:16:55.720 --> 00:16:57.710 align:middle line:90%
is maybe our ancestors talking?

00:16:57.710 --> 00:17:01.093 align:middle line:84%
I don't mean literally,
but the chemistry of them.

00:17:01.093 --> 00:17:03.010 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So what if you
end up with something

00:17:03.010 --> 00:17:04.983 align:middle line:90%
like a form of leukemia?

00:17:04.983 --> 00:17:05.900 align:middle line:90%
>>DALE: There you are.

00:17:05.900 --> 00:17:06.740 align:middle line:90%
Bone marrow.

00:17:06.740 --> 00:17:07.540 align:middle line:10%
>>REGINA: Exactly.

00:17:07.540 --> 00:17:08.390 align:middle line:10%
>>DALE: Epigenetics.

00:17:08.390 --> 00:17:13.300 align:middle line:84%
I think the healing that
science has to stretch into

00:17:13.300 --> 00:17:15.765 align:middle line:84%
will be using sound
and light and some--

00:17:15.765 --> 00:17:16.640 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Absolutely.

00:17:16.640 --> 00:17:17.515 align:middle line:90%
>>DALE: It has to be.

00:17:17.515 --> 00:17:20.089 align:middle line:84%
And some kind of psychological
understanding as well.

00:17:20.089 --> 00:17:22.339 align:middle line:84%
But it's going to be
about epigenetics.

00:17:22.339 --> 00:17:25.609 align:middle line:10%
You influence the epigenes,
you can influence the genes.

00:17:25.609 --> 00:17:27.050 align:middle line:10%
You can influence
everything else.

00:17:27.050 --> 00:17:28.730 align:middle line:10%
You influence the bone marrow.

00:17:28.730 --> 00:17:31.498 align:middle line:84%
I mean, a lot of people these
days have autoimmune disorders.

00:17:31.498 --> 00:17:33.290 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And have bone
marrow transplants.

00:17:33.290 --> 00:17:34.510 align:middle line:90%
>>DALE: Absolutely.

00:17:34.510 --> 00:17:35.540 align:middle line:90%
Stem cells.

00:17:35.540 --> 00:17:37.540 align:middle line:90%
Stem cells can remake the body.

00:17:37.540 --> 00:17:41.620 align:middle line:84%
One of the most challenging,
difficult situations

00:17:41.620 --> 00:17:43.640 align:middle line:84%
is when we go through
enough stress,

00:17:43.640 --> 00:17:45.700 align:middle line:84%
the bone marrow starts
making these little,

00:17:45.700 --> 00:17:50.390 align:middle line:84%
tiny cells called mast
cells, and they proliferate.

00:17:50.390 --> 00:17:52.400 align:middle line:90%
They're very primal cells.

00:17:52.400 --> 00:17:54.910 align:middle line:84%
They're sort of like immune
cells and they're sort

00:17:54.910 --> 00:17:56.883 align:middle line:90%
of like neurons, which is--

00:17:56.883 --> 00:17:57.800 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Interesting.

00:17:57.800 --> 00:17:58.750 align:middle line:90%
>>DALE: I know.

00:17:58.750 --> 00:18:02.900 align:middle line:84%
And so they end up with more and
more inflammation in the body.

00:18:02.900 --> 00:18:06.100 align:middle line:84%
And I think the patterning
of that inflammation

00:18:06.100 --> 00:18:11.150 align:middle line:84%
might very well mirror misfiring
in our neurological system,

00:18:11.150 --> 00:18:13.990 align:middle line:90%
misfiring in our microbiome.

00:18:13.990 --> 00:18:17.170 align:middle line:84%
I think by the time we
get really stressed,

00:18:17.170 --> 00:18:21.040 align:middle line:84%
which we get to in
our lifetime, we

00:18:21.040 --> 00:18:27.220 align:middle line:84%
have a lot of the organ
systems firing in a way that's

00:18:27.220 --> 00:18:28.860 align:middle line:90%
not healthy for us.

00:18:28.860 --> 00:18:30.610 align:middle line:90%
How do we get into that?

00:18:30.610 --> 00:18:31.720 align:middle line:90%
How do we stop that?

00:18:31.720 --> 00:18:33.040 align:middle line:90%
It's complicated.

00:18:33.040 --> 00:18:34.380 align:middle line:90%
What plug do we pull?

00:18:34.380 --> 00:18:35.940 align:middle line:90%
Where do we start?

00:18:35.940 --> 00:18:39.840 align:middle line:10%
Epigenetics can help, a past
life regression can help.

00:18:39.840 --> 00:18:44.140 align:middle line:10%
Looking at a real causal
trauma in this life can help.

00:18:44.140 --> 00:18:47.140 align:middle line:84%
Looking at an ancestor
track can help.

00:18:47.140 --> 00:18:49.900 align:middle line:84%
We have to find the key
for ourselves, I think.

00:18:49.900 --> 00:18:50.940 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Interesting.

00:18:50.940 --> 00:18:53.398 align:middle line:84%
So this chakra, this 10th chakra
we've been talking about--

00:18:53.398 --> 00:18:54.198 align:middle line:90%
>>DALE: Yeah.

00:18:54.198 --> 00:18:56.250 align:middle line:10%
>>REGINA: --you say this
is what brings together

00:18:56.250 --> 00:18:59.020 align:middle line:10%
the subconscious and the soul.

00:18:59.020 --> 00:19:02.160 align:middle line:84%
It brings the whole mix,
the matrix of our levels

00:19:02.160 --> 00:19:04.030 align:middle line:90%
of mind and memory together.

00:19:04.030 --> 00:19:04.990 align:middle line:90%
>>DALE: It does.

00:19:04.990 --> 00:19:05.790 align:middle line:90%
Thank you.

00:19:05.790 --> 00:19:10.440 align:middle line:84%
I should put that in my book,
but that-- but it's too late.

00:19:10.440 --> 00:19:12.730 align:middle line:90%
Well, it is.

00:19:12.730 --> 00:19:18.220 align:middle line:84%
It's the tissue of body,
mind, and soul is what it is.

00:19:18.220 --> 00:19:22.570 align:middle line:84%
I'm very enthralled with
some of the Daoist ideas too.

00:19:22.570 --> 00:19:28.670 align:middle line:84%
And one of their approaches is
that underneath the subconscious

00:19:28.670 --> 00:19:33.540 align:middle line:84%
is another level of reality that
could be called the subluminal.

00:19:33.540 --> 00:19:35.057 align:middle line:90%
I'm very system-based.

00:19:35.057 --> 00:19:36.390 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah, so explain that.

00:19:36.390 --> 00:19:37.530 align:middle line:90%
I like systems too.

00:19:37.530 --> 00:19:37.730 align:middle line:90%
>>DALE: Yeah.

00:19:37.730 --> 00:19:39.150 align:middle line:10%
>>REGINA: Explain
the subluminal.

00:19:39.150 --> 00:19:42.950 align:middle line:10%
>>DALE: OK, so if we think
of the chakra system, which

00:19:42.950 --> 00:19:45.560 align:middle line:10%
is really the vertical
aspect of the body,

00:19:45.560 --> 00:19:50.280 align:middle line:10%
way, way above us, according
to my version of Daoism,

00:19:50.280 --> 00:19:52.890 align:middle line:10%
would be what we call
the superluminal,

00:19:52.890 --> 00:19:55.070 align:middle line:10%
like the heavenly
energy that moves faster

00:19:55.070 --> 00:19:56.220 align:middle line:10%
than the speed of light.

00:19:56.220 --> 00:19:59.370 align:middle line:84%
Then we come into the top
chakras that are more spiritual,

00:19:59.370 --> 00:20:01.200 align:middle line:84%
the middle that
are psychological,

00:20:01.200 --> 00:20:02.870 align:middle line:90%
the lower that are dense.

00:20:02.870 --> 00:20:05.700 align:middle line:84%
Here's our 10th chakra,
which is our densest.

00:20:05.700 --> 00:20:10.340 align:middle line:84%
So it really does impact
the majority of who we are

00:20:10.340 --> 00:20:11.810 align:middle line:90%
and what's happening.

00:20:11.810 --> 00:20:15.720 align:middle line:84%
And underneath the
subconscious, the subluminal--

00:20:15.720 --> 00:20:16.890 align:middle line:90%
I want to say subliminal.

00:20:16.890 --> 00:20:17.690 align:middle line:90%
It's not.

00:20:17.690 --> 00:20:19.023 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah, it's subluminal.

00:20:19.023 --> 00:20:22.440 align:middle line:84%
>>DALE: Subluminal,
sub means slower,

00:20:22.440 --> 00:20:25.460 align:middle line:84%
so it's slower than
the speed of light.

00:20:25.460 --> 00:20:26.610 align:middle line:90%
It's stillness.

00:20:26.610 --> 00:20:27.780 align:middle line:90%
It's the void.

00:20:27.780 --> 00:20:30.830 align:middle line:84%
And I think it has
the keys, the codes,

00:20:30.830 --> 00:20:36.300 align:middle line:84%
and the truths that if we bring
them up into the subconscious,

00:20:36.300 --> 00:20:41.450 align:middle line:84%
you can kind of feel it, up into
the 10th chakra without having

00:20:41.450 --> 00:20:46.980 align:middle line:84%
to master every single healing
system presented to us,

00:20:46.980 --> 00:20:51.200 align:middle line:84%
we can actually start to
alter those really fundamental

00:20:51.200 --> 00:20:54.770 align:middle line:90%
programs, the untruths.

00:20:54.770 --> 00:20:59.660 align:middle line:84%
We can change the versions of
what happened to our ancestors

00:20:59.660 --> 00:21:01.920 align:middle line:90%
to take what's good out of them.

00:21:01.920 --> 00:21:05.930 align:middle line:84%
We can start to relate to
our own subconscious and soul

00:21:05.930 --> 00:21:10.020 align:middle line:84%
in a more hearty way, and
we can start to transmute.

00:21:10.020 --> 00:21:13.520 align:middle line:10%
So that's one of the easiest
ways that I like to approach

00:21:13.520 --> 00:21:17.670 align:middle line:10%
healing, is let's bring energy
up through the subluminal,

00:21:17.670 --> 00:21:21.980 align:middle line:10%
through the 10th, up in
the body, and let truth,

00:21:21.980 --> 00:21:26.840 align:middle line:10%
still truths, start to just
remake through us and for us.

00:21:26.840 --> 00:21:30.700 align:middle line:10%
We might still have
to do some efforting.

00:21:30.700 --> 00:21:32.720 align:middle line:84%
We might still have
to not go to the bar

00:21:32.720 --> 00:21:34.930 align:middle line:84%
if we're trying to
stop being an alcoholic

00:21:34.930 --> 00:21:37.990 align:middle line:84%
or not buy a chocolate cake
and put it in the pantry.

00:21:37.990 --> 00:21:39.760 align:middle line:84%
But it's going to
be easier to do that

00:21:39.760 --> 00:21:41.690 align:middle line:84%
when we're bringing
these truths up.

00:21:41.690 --> 00:21:42.620 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Interesting.

00:21:42.620 --> 00:21:44.537 align:middle line:84%
Because as you're talking,
I'm seeing a couple

00:21:44.537 --> 00:21:45.530 align:middle line:90%
different things.

00:21:45.530 --> 00:21:47.170 align:middle line:90%
All right.

00:21:47.170 --> 00:21:49.820 align:middle line:84%
So one of them is you're
talking about the void.

00:21:49.820 --> 00:21:50.620 align:middle line:90%
>>DALE: I am.

00:21:50.620 --> 00:21:52.510 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: You're talking
about essentially

00:21:52.510 --> 00:21:53.490 align:middle line:90%
the original template.

00:21:53.490 --> 00:21:54.290 align:middle line:90%
>>DALE: I am.

00:21:54.290 --> 00:21:56.410 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And because
you may be inheriting

00:21:56.410 --> 00:22:00.680 align:middle line:84%
these traits from yourself
and others in your bloodlines,

00:22:00.680 --> 00:22:02.800 align:middle line:84%
at the same time, your
individuated consciousness

00:22:02.800 --> 00:22:04.640 align:middle line:90%
that had an original template.

00:22:04.640 --> 00:22:05.560 align:middle line:90%
>>DALE: Exactly.

00:22:05.560 --> 00:22:06.970 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And so
that template is

00:22:06.970 --> 00:22:10.120 align:middle line:84%
before the subconscious
begins being programmed

00:22:10.120 --> 00:22:12.270 align:middle line:90%
by trauma, loss, et cetera.

00:22:12.270 --> 00:22:13.070 align:middle line:90%
>>DALE: Absolutely.

00:22:13.070 --> 00:22:13.525 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: So you're basically--

00:22:13.525 --> 00:22:14.530 align:middle line:90%
>>DALE: Or even rewards, even--

00:22:14.530 --> 00:22:15.740 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Or even rewards.

00:22:15.740 --> 00:22:18.115 align:middle line:84%
Yeah, even the rewards because
it's positive and negative

00:22:18.115 --> 00:22:19.340 align:middle line:90%
that feed the subconscious.

00:22:19.340 --> 00:22:21.910 align:middle line:10%
Then what I'm seeing is
this particular healing

00:22:21.910 --> 00:22:25.780 align:middle line:10%
technique that I have found
to be effective for people

00:22:25.780 --> 00:22:28.600 align:middle line:10%
on others, which has
to do with collapsing

00:22:28.600 --> 00:22:31.160 align:middle line:10%
your current condition into
your original template,

00:22:31.160 --> 00:22:35.440 align:middle line:10%
your perfected state, which is
that perfected state I always

00:22:35.440 --> 00:22:37.660 align:middle line:10%
see when I'm
envisioning it, it's

00:22:37.660 --> 00:22:40.880 align:middle line:10%
radiating a lot of
light and wattage,

00:22:40.880 --> 00:22:44.380 align:middle line:10%
but it's actually the
original template which

00:22:44.380 --> 00:22:45.980 align:middle line:10%
you're describing as the void.

00:22:45.980 --> 00:22:48.830 align:middle line:10%
It doesn't really matter
which way you visualize it.

00:22:48.830 --> 00:22:51.820 align:middle line:10%
It's the original template
and collapsing them

00:22:51.820 --> 00:22:54.860 align:middle line:10%
until the body now collapses
back into its original state.

00:22:54.860 --> 00:22:56.450 align:middle line:84%
>>DALE: That's
exactly what it is.

00:22:56.450 --> 00:22:58.010 align:middle line:90%
It's the original template.

00:22:58.010 --> 00:23:01.190 align:middle line:84%
I have a friend who has
18 advanced degrees,

00:23:01.190 --> 00:23:03.080 align:middle line:90%
so I can hardly understand him.

00:23:03.080 --> 00:23:05.530 align:middle line:84%
But what I do is he
talks about where

00:23:05.530 --> 00:23:08.120 align:middle line:84%
we get illness, but
also creativity,

00:23:08.120 --> 00:23:10.130 align:middle line:90%
where we have our problems.

00:23:10.130 --> 00:23:14.210 align:middle line:84%
And this could fit for the Earth
as well as our individual cells,

00:23:14.210 --> 00:23:18.920 align:middle line:84%
is the gaps between the original
templates and how we are.

00:23:18.920 --> 00:23:20.830 align:middle line:84%
So we could even look
at the Earth this way.

00:23:20.830 --> 00:23:21.240 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:23:21.240 --> 00:23:21.700 align:middle line:90%
>>DALE: Yeah.

00:23:21.700 --> 00:23:22.825 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah, absolutely.

00:23:22.825 --> 00:23:24.490 align:middle line:90%
Anything, any conscious being.

00:23:24.490 --> 00:23:25.710 align:middle line:90%
>>DALE: DNA has gaps.

00:23:25.710 --> 00:23:29.670 align:middle line:84%
It's called a chirals,
C-H-I-R-A-L-S.

00:23:29.670 --> 00:23:32.580 align:middle line:84%
Those strands don't
line up exactly.

00:23:32.580 --> 00:23:34.780 align:middle line:90%
So they're not really lined up.

00:23:34.780 --> 00:23:37.900 align:middle line:84%
We can create transformation
and alterations.

00:23:37.900 --> 00:23:40.963 align:middle line:84%
But also, there is where
the problems lie too.

00:23:40.963 --> 00:23:41.880 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Interesting.

00:23:41.880 --> 00:23:46.650 align:middle line:84%
So it's really
having an intention

00:23:46.650 --> 00:23:49.540 align:middle line:84%
to return to the
original template.

00:23:49.540 --> 00:23:50.550 align:middle line:90%
>>DALE: Yes.

00:23:50.550 --> 00:23:52.842 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Because that's a
very direct path by the way.

00:23:52.842 --> 00:23:54.960 align:middle line:84%
I mean, that's, yeah, you
have to not buy the cake

00:23:54.960 --> 00:23:56.350 align:middle line:90%
and not go to the bar.

00:23:56.350 --> 00:23:59.020 align:middle line:84%
It's almost by process
of elimination.

00:23:59.020 --> 00:24:03.270 align:middle line:84%
But you can tap back into
that original template

00:24:03.270 --> 00:24:05.400 align:middle line:84%
by simple knowledge,
A, that it's there

00:24:05.400 --> 00:24:06.850 align:middle line:90%
and you have that capability.

00:24:06.850 --> 00:24:07.710 align:middle line:90%
>>DALE: Exactly.

00:24:07.710 --> 00:24:09.465 align:middle line:90%
And I love the--

00:24:09.465 --> 00:24:10.840 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: I love
this by the way.

00:24:10.840 --> 00:24:11.640 align:middle line:90%
>>DALE: Thank you.

00:24:11.640 --> 00:24:13.230 align:middle line:84%
And I love the
collapsing into it

00:24:13.230 --> 00:24:15.840 align:middle line:84%
because there is a certain
amount of surrender,

00:24:15.840 --> 00:24:18.430 align:middle line:84%
whether we know how
to surrender or not.

00:24:18.430 --> 00:24:21.610 align:middle line:84%
Sometimes I just say just
force me, please, helpers.

00:24:21.610 --> 00:24:22.410 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:24:22.410 --> 00:24:22.740 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:24:22.740 --> 00:24:23.540 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:24:23.540 --> 00:24:24.880 align:middle line:90%
>>DALE: Just take it from me.

00:24:24.880 --> 00:24:26.440 align:middle line:90%
Just help me do this.

00:24:26.440 --> 00:24:30.325 align:middle line:84%
It's OK to ask for help too,
but there is a surrendering too.

00:24:30.325 --> 00:24:31.950 align:middle line:10%
>>REGINA: You have
to be willing to let

00:24:31.950 --> 00:24:33.960 align:middle line:10%
go of the compilation
of everything that

00:24:33.960 --> 00:24:36.540 align:middle line:10%
has made you, you if you're
going to collapse back

00:24:36.540 --> 00:24:38.590 align:middle line:10%
into that original template.

00:24:38.590 --> 00:24:41.910 align:middle line:84%
But with it comes
can be robust health

00:24:41.910 --> 00:24:44.130 align:middle line:84%
in any number of
good things if you're

00:24:44.130 --> 00:24:46.797 align:middle line:84%
willing to let go of
your current creation.

00:24:46.797 --> 00:24:47.880 align:middle line:90%
>>DALE: And we get to be--

00:24:47.880 --> 00:24:49.060 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: To the extent you can.

00:24:49.060 --> 00:24:49.860 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:24:49.860 --> 00:24:52.480 align:middle line:84%
>>DALE: I'm sure you've had
experiences like this too,

00:24:52.480 --> 00:24:55.500 align:middle line:84%
but when I was little,
I was frustrated often.

00:24:55.500 --> 00:24:56.580 align:middle line:90%
I'm like, I don't--

00:24:56.580 --> 00:24:58.540 align:middle line:90%
I'm not getting to be who I am.

00:24:58.540 --> 00:24:59.355 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:24:59.355 --> 00:25:01.900 align:middle line:84%
>>DALE: I don't know how
to say what I want to say.

00:25:01.900 --> 00:25:05.470 align:middle line:84%
I remember when I was five,
living in Huntsville, Alabama,

00:25:05.470 --> 00:25:10.510 align:middle line:84%
hanging out at this
apple tree going,

00:25:10.510 --> 00:25:12.670 align:middle line:84%
I remember when I
was a woman before.

00:25:12.670 --> 00:25:16.140 align:middle line:84%
I have a long time before
I get there again until I

00:25:16.140 --> 00:25:17.230 align:middle line:90%
have some free will.

00:25:17.230 --> 00:25:19.577 align:middle line:90%


00:25:19.577 --> 00:25:22.160 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So listen, there's one
anecdote you tell in the book

00:25:22.160 --> 00:25:24.320 align:middle line:84%
that it's really
wonderful and it

00:25:24.320 --> 00:25:28.170 align:middle line:84%
has to do with a doctor
who was just closed off.

00:25:28.170 --> 00:25:30.295 align:middle line:84%
And let's talk a little
bit about him for a moment.

00:25:30.295 --> 00:25:31.095 align:middle line:90%
>>DALE: He was.

00:25:31.095 --> 00:25:32.100 align:middle line:90%
He was a German doctor.

00:25:32.100 --> 00:25:34.017 align:middle line:84%
Not that that part makes
that much difference,

00:25:34.017 --> 00:25:35.910 align:middle line:84%
but I do believe that
certain ancestry--

00:25:35.910 --> 00:25:36.720 align:middle line:90%
I am Norwegian.

00:25:36.720 --> 00:25:41.260 align:middle line:84%
I'm very stubborn, and that
is very Northern European.

00:25:41.260 --> 00:25:42.060 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: It is.

00:25:42.060 --> 00:25:42.860 align:middle line:90%
I am too.

00:25:42.860 --> 00:25:45.920 align:middle line:84%
I'm Northern European, but
British, Scottish, and German.

00:25:45.920 --> 00:25:48.810 align:middle line:84%
And it is a little more austere,
not quite as touchy-feely.

00:25:48.810 --> 00:25:49.610 align:middle line:90%
>>DALE: Yeah.

00:25:49.610 --> 00:25:52.110 align:middle line:90%
And he just he was sick.

00:25:52.110 --> 00:25:53.070 align:middle line:90%
He wouldn't admit it.

00:25:53.070 --> 00:25:54.180 align:middle line:90%
He wouldn't work on it.

00:25:54.180 --> 00:25:56.750 align:middle line:84%
He had heart problems,
heart disease.

00:25:56.750 --> 00:25:59.970 align:middle line:84%
Honestly, and this might even
be more than was in the book,

00:25:59.970 --> 00:26:03.600 align:middle line:84%
the only people he let
in were he raised dogs.

00:26:03.600 --> 00:26:05.200 align:middle line:90%
He had like 40 dogs.

00:26:05.200 --> 00:26:06.000 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Oh.

00:26:06.000 --> 00:26:07.750 align:middle line:84%
>>DALE: No, I didn't
put that in the book.

00:26:07.750 --> 00:26:09.920 align:middle line:90%


00:26:09.920 --> 00:26:11.450 align:middle line:10%
>>REGINA: OK.

00:26:11.450 --> 00:26:15.890 align:middle line:84%
>>DALE: But he-- but in the
storyline, he ended up--

00:26:15.890 --> 00:26:18.730 align:middle line:84%
we ended up finding out
that in his ancestry,

00:26:18.730 --> 00:26:23.440 align:middle line:84%
there had been actually some
Nazi situations back there

00:26:23.440 --> 00:26:25.360 align:middle line:90%
that were still impacting him.

00:26:25.360 --> 00:26:27.640 align:middle line:84%
And in his own
past lives, he had

00:26:27.640 --> 00:26:31.550 align:middle line:84%
gone through a situation where
he totally closed off to love.

00:26:31.550 --> 00:26:35.930 align:middle line:84%
So his ancestry mirrored
what he had been.

00:26:35.930 --> 00:26:38.330 align:middle line:84%
And so, of course, that
impacted his heart.

00:26:38.330 --> 00:26:40.730 align:middle line:84%
He had heart disease and a
lot of other different issues

00:26:40.730 --> 00:26:43.130 align:middle line:84%
too-- arthritis,
autoimmune dysfunction.

00:26:43.130 --> 00:26:48.040 align:middle line:84%
He was grumpy as all get out
too, except with his dogs,

00:26:48.040 --> 00:26:52.610 align:middle line:84%
and he secluded himself
on his dog farm as well.

00:26:52.610 --> 00:26:57.050 align:middle line:84%
So once we started to be able to
unlock that just a little bit,

00:26:57.050 --> 00:27:01.690 align:middle line:84%
he started to open up
and he met somebody who--

00:27:01.690 --> 00:27:04.420 align:middle line:84%
and this may not be all the
way in the book either, but who

00:27:04.420 --> 00:27:08.270 align:middle line:84%
was in the dog industry, and
he formed a relationship.

00:27:08.270 --> 00:27:09.070 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Aw.

00:27:09.070 --> 00:27:09.760 align:middle line:90%
>>DALE: I know.

00:27:09.760 --> 00:27:11.677 align:middle line:84%
He formed a relationship
and his heart disease

00:27:11.677 --> 00:27:13.470 align:middle line:90%
started to disappear as well.

00:27:13.470 --> 00:27:15.220 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And their
focus was on the thing

00:27:15.220 --> 00:27:16.300 align:middle line:90%
they mutually-- the dogs.

00:27:16.300 --> 00:27:17.100 align:middle line:90%
>>DALE: Exactly.

00:27:17.100 --> 00:27:20.390 align:middle line:84%
They were able to turn that into
love instead of a hiding place.

00:27:20.390 --> 00:27:23.170 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: It seems to me that
dogs right now are providing

00:27:23.170 --> 00:27:26.260 align:middle line:84%
such a critical
role on this planet

00:27:26.260 --> 00:27:28.240 align:middle line:84%
as people are more
confused, they

00:27:28.240 --> 00:27:30.170 align:middle line:90%
can't tell fact from fiction.

00:27:30.170 --> 00:27:32.600 align:middle line:84%
They don't-- they're
like, I can't find love.

00:27:32.600 --> 00:27:36.380 align:middle line:84%
It seems that the one
species, more than any other,

00:27:36.380 --> 00:27:38.420 align:middle line:84%
not to say anything
against cats,

00:27:38.420 --> 00:27:43.570 align:middle line:84%
but dogs seem to be able to come
in and draw the heart back out

00:27:43.570 --> 00:27:45.682 align:middle line:84%
again and keep us
connected to our hearts.

00:27:45.682 --> 00:27:46.640 align:middle line:90%
>>DALE: They are heart.

00:27:46.640 --> 00:27:48.250 align:middle line:84%
And I'm currently
learning a lesson

00:27:48.250 --> 00:27:51.950 align:middle line:84%
with one of my dogs,
Carl, who is a rescue dog.

00:27:51.950 --> 00:27:54.240 align:middle line:84%
He was a farm dog who
came with no manners

00:27:54.240 --> 00:27:55.490 align:middle line:90%
when he was a year and a half.

00:27:55.490 --> 00:27:57.910 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: I had one of
those two that I adopted.

00:27:57.910 --> 00:27:58.897 align:middle line:90%
No manners.

00:27:58.897 --> 00:28:00.980 align:middle line:84%
>>DALE: Well, I put him
in six weeks of boot camp.

00:28:00.980 --> 00:28:03.560 align:middle line:84%
Let me say that because I
couldn't do more than that.

00:28:03.560 --> 00:28:04.820 align:middle line:90%
Very scared.

00:28:04.820 --> 00:28:05.900 align:middle line:90%
Scared of garbage cans.

00:28:05.900 --> 00:28:07.810 align:middle line:90%
Scared of men.

00:28:07.810 --> 00:28:08.750 align:middle line:90%
Scared of lights.

00:28:08.750 --> 00:28:09.710 align:middle line:90%
Scared of stairs.

00:28:09.710 --> 00:28:10.850 align:middle line:90%
Scared of the backyard.

00:28:10.850 --> 00:28:11.930 align:middle line:90%
Scared of everybody.

00:28:11.930 --> 00:28:13.000 align:middle line:90%
Just scared.

00:28:13.000 --> 00:28:18.360 align:middle line:84%
And it's helped me to
bring him along and teach

00:28:18.360 --> 00:28:19.660 align:middle line:90%
him to be less scared.

00:28:19.660 --> 00:28:20.460 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:28:20.460 --> 00:28:22.090 align:middle line:84%
>>DALE: I had one
more challenge,

00:28:22.090 --> 00:28:24.610 align:middle line:84%
which was, it sounds odd,
but getting his nails done

00:28:24.610 --> 00:28:25.410 align:middle line:90%
and grooming.

00:28:25.410 --> 00:28:26.370 align:middle line:90%
Scared to death.

00:28:26.370 --> 00:28:28.110 align:middle line:84%
Bites on anybody who
tries to do that.

00:28:28.110 --> 00:28:29.530 align:middle line:90%
Tried over and over.

00:28:29.530 --> 00:28:31.320 align:middle line:84%
I finally went to
the veterinarian

00:28:31.320 --> 00:28:32.620 align:middle line:90%
and I said, can you help?

00:28:32.620 --> 00:28:35.230 align:middle line:84%
They said, we're going
to do happy visits.

00:28:35.230 --> 00:28:37.550 align:middle line:84%
He's just going to come in
and eat cheese and crackers.

00:28:37.550 --> 00:28:38.350 align:middle line:90%
That's it.

00:28:38.350 --> 00:28:39.760 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: What a great idea.

00:28:39.760 --> 00:28:41.290 align:middle line:84%
>>DALE: I've done
six happy visits.

00:28:41.290 --> 00:28:42.630 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: OK.

00:28:42.630 --> 00:28:45.690 align:middle line:84%
>>DALE: So during a
happy visit, while he's

00:28:45.690 --> 00:28:49.560 align:middle line:84%
eating cheese and crackers, I
can groom him a little bit now

00:28:49.560 --> 00:28:51.263 align:middle line:90%
and they can give him his shots.

00:28:51.263 --> 00:28:52.680 align:middle line:84%
So now we're going
to be able to--

00:28:52.680 --> 00:28:54.430 align:middle line:84%
I hate to say it, but
knock him out and do

00:28:54.430 --> 00:28:55.800 align:middle line:90%
his grooming and his nails.

00:28:55.800 --> 00:29:00.610 align:middle line:84%
So even when these animals
come to us with a need,

00:29:00.610 --> 00:29:01.443 align:middle line:90%
it opens our hearts.

00:29:01.443 --> 00:29:03.068 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: It opens
our hearts even when

00:29:03.068 --> 00:29:04.450 align:middle line:90%
they're damaged little beings.

00:29:04.450 --> 00:29:06.810 align:middle line:84%
>>DALE: And it helps
us become a better--

00:29:06.810 --> 00:29:08.050 align:middle line:90%
better to ourselves.

00:29:08.050 --> 00:29:11.310 align:middle line:84%
Who knows what inner children
I'm healing for myself

00:29:11.310 --> 00:29:12.518 align:middle line:90%
while I'm doing this too?

00:29:12.518 --> 00:29:13.810 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: And it's interesting.

00:29:13.810 --> 00:29:17.790 align:middle line:84%
I've had some wonderful dogs,
just I've loved every dog

00:29:17.790 --> 00:29:20.710 align:middle line:84%
and they take on
our physical pain.

00:29:20.710 --> 00:29:23.490 align:middle line:84%
It's amazing how we
don't really understand

00:29:23.490 --> 00:29:24.880 align:middle line:90%
what they're taking on for us.

00:29:24.880 --> 00:29:26.960 align:middle line:84%
Not just emotions,
even physical.

00:29:26.960 --> 00:29:27.760 align:middle line:90%
>>DALE: They are.

00:29:27.760 --> 00:29:32.460 align:middle line:84%
And I do like my cat,
Garfield, because when

00:29:32.460 --> 00:29:36.840 align:middle line:84%
he came to live with me, he
was given to me by my son who

00:29:36.840 --> 00:29:38.132 align:middle line:90%
adopted him but then I got him.

00:29:38.132 --> 00:29:38.965 align:middle line:10%
>>REGINA: Of course.

00:29:38.965 --> 00:29:40.510 align:middle line:10%
>>DALE: I said, I don't do cats.

00:29:40.510 --> 00:29:43.028 align:middle line:84%
And he goes, well, mom, I'm
traveling, blah, blah, blah.

00:29:43.028 --> 00:29:44.820 align:middle line:84%
I said, well, then he's
turning into a dog.

00:29:44.820 --> 00:29:47.890 align:middle line:84%
And he lines up just like
the dogs for a snack.

00:29:47.890 --> 00:29:49.470 align:middle line:90%
He walks on a leash.

00:29:49.470 --> 00:29:52.390 align:middle line:84%
So cats can be turned
and transplanted.

00:29:52.390 --> 00:29:53.190 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: OK.

00:29:53.190 --> 00:29:54.880 align:middle line:90%
Thank you for clarifying that.

00:29:54.880 --> 00:29:55.080 align:middle line:90%
>>DALE: Yes.

00:29:55.080 --> 00:29:55.880 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: OK.

00:29:55.880 --> 00:29:58.300 align:middle line:84%
So one thing we haven't
talked about yet, again,

00:29:58.300 --> 00:30:02.580 align:middle line:84%
this fascinating 10th chakra
that binds all these parts

00:30:02.580 --> 00:30:05.180 align:middle line:84%
of our being together is that
you say it doesn't really come

00:30:05.180 --> 00:30:05.980 align:middle line:90%
online.

00:30:05.980 --> 00:30:10.700 align:middle line:84%
We don't really start using
it until, what, 35 to 40ish.

00:30:10.700 --> 00:30:13.760 align:middle line:84%
>>DALE: Yeah, it's active
during preconception,

00:30:13.760 --> 00:30:15.270 align:middle line:90%
but then it goes dormant.

00:30:15.270 --> 00:30:17.840 align:middle line:84%
So I do believe that through
it, our consciousness, that's

00:30:17.840 --> 00:30:21.660 align:middle line:84%
the easiest way to say it, is
selecting up a genetic material.

00:30:21.660 --> 00:30:23.500 align:middle line:90%
What are we going to encode?

00:30:23.500 --> 00:30:25.230 align:middle line:84%
This and that and
the other thing.

00:30:25.230 --> 00:30:29.150 align:middle line:84%
And then it doesn't really come
online again until 35 to 42,

00:30:29.150 --> 00:30:32.520 align:middle line:84%
which I think is fascinating
because it is our grounding

00:30:32.520 --> 00:30:33.320 align:middle line:90%
chakra.

00:30:33.320 --> 00:30:37.200 align:middle line:84%
Right before then, we go
through many of our chakras.

00:30:37.200 --> 00:30:40.220 align:middle line:84%
We go all the way
through the basic seven.

00:30:40.220 --> 00:30:43.520 align:middle line:84%
We go through eighth,
which is karma.

00:30:43.520 --> 00:30:45.620 align:middle line:84%
We go through ninth,
which is learning

00:30:45.620 --> 00:30:49.010 align:middle line:84%
a little bit about how to be
more harmonic and who we are.

00:30:49.010 --> 00:30:53.130 align:middle line:84%
And then we start with the
real groundedness of who we are

00:30:53.130 --> 00:30:54.380 align:middle line:90%
and what we're supposed to be.

00:30:54.380 --> 00:30:56.880 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: By then, a lot of
times people are having families

00:30:56.880 --> 00:30:59.330 align:middle line:84%
and our careers are
getting more solidified.

00:30:59.330 --> 00:31:01.350 align:middle line:84%
>>DALE: Yeah, so you're
safer, hopefully.

00:31:01.350 --> 00:31:03.030 align:middle line:90%
There's a safety.

00:31:03.030 --> 00:31:05.540 align:middle line:84%
And I think sometimes
that's when people also

00:31:05.540 --> 00:31:07.455 align:middle line:84%
start to examine
more of their issues.

00:31:07.455 --> 00:31:08.330 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: I think so.

00:31:08.330 --> 00:31:08.970 align:middle line:90%
>>DALE: Yeah.

00:31:08.970 --> 00:31:09.840 align:middle line:90%
Who am I?

00:31:09.840 --> 00:31:11.250 align:middle line:90%
How did I become this?

00:31:11.250 --> 00:31:13.280 align:middle line:84%
You're seeing yourself
mirrored in your children

00:31:13.280 --> 00:31:14.880 align:middle line:84%
or you have somebody
completely different

00:31:14.880 --> 00:31:16.230 align:middle line:84%
and you don't know
what the heck to do.

00:31:16.230 --> 00:31:18.240 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: I always start
asking the bigger questions.

00:31:18.240 --> 00:31:18.810 align:middle line:90%
>>DALE: You do.

00:31:18.810 --> 00:31:18.980 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:31:18.980 --> 00:31:20.650 align:middle line:90%
>>DALE: And what's my value?

00:31:20.650 --> 00:31:21.450 align:middle line:90%
What's it worth?

00:31:21.450 --> 00:31:22.860 align:middle line:90%
Do I like what I'm doing?

00:31:22.860 --> 00:31:25.290 align:middle line:84%
And sometimes we can change
and sometimes we can't.

00:31:25.290 --> 00:31:27.992 align:middle line:84%
But we can always alter
our insights as well.

00:31:27.992 --> 00:31:29.700 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So that's
where I wanted to go.

00:31:29.700 --> 00:31:32.040 align:middle line:84%
We're going to now the
eighth and ninth chakra.

00:31:32.040 --> 00:31:35.410 align:middle line:84%
And then it skips over
the big 10th chakra,

00:31:35.410 --> 00:31:37.410 align:middle line:84%
which seems to have dropped
down below the feet.

00:31:37.410 --> 00:31:40.258 align:middle line:84%
So OK, let's talk about what
the eighth and ninth chakra are.

00:31:40.258 --> 00:31:41.550 align:middle line:90%
>>DALE: There is a rationality.

00:31:41.550 --> 00:31:42.270 align:middle line:90%
I'll go to that.

00:31:42.270 --> 00:31:43.140 align:middle line:10%
>>REGINA: Please tell us.

00:31:43.140 --> 00:31:44.052 align:middle line:90%
>>DALE: OK.

00:31:44.052 --> 00:31:48.270 align:middle line:84%
So the chakras rise
vertically one all the way up.

00:31:48.270 --> 00:31:50.370 align:middle line:90%
The eighth is above the crown.

00:31:50.370 --> 00:31:53.940 align:middle line:84%
It looks at first just
like a little black dot.

00:31:53.940 --> 00:31:58.860 align:middle line:84%
But once you enter there, it's
eight chakra activates 21 to 28.

00:31:58.860 --> 00:32:03.120 align:middle line:84%
That's when we get past
life stuff recurring.

00:32:03.120 --> 00:32:05.310 align:middle line:84%
We get maybe our first
marriages or this or that,

00:32:05.310 --> 00:32:07.040 align:middle line:84%
or the other thing,
our first blunders.

00:32:07.040 --> 00:32:08.890 align:middle line:84%
All of a sudden we're
really developing

00:32:08.890 --> 00:32:11.300 align:middle line:84%
and it may not work so
well all the time either.

00:32:11.300 --> 00:32:12.100 align:middle line:90%
We have to double--

00:32:12.100 --> 00:32:13.940 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Our first
attempts at adulting--

00:32:13.940 --> 00:32:14.220 align:middle line:90%
>>DALE: Exactly.

00:32:14.220 --> 00:32:15.512 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: --as it's now called.

00:32:15.512 --> 00:32:16.330 align:middle line:90%
>>DALE: Exactly.

00:32:16.330 --> 00:32:18.310 align:middle line:84%
Well, and the brain
often doesn't come on

00:32:18.310 --> 00:32:20.240 align:middle line:84%
till near the end
of that as well.

00:32:20.240 --> 00:32:23.390 align:middle line:84%
But that eighth chakra
is a mystical chakra.

00:32:23.390 --> 00:32:27.140 align:middle line:84%
Through it, we can
access Akashic records,

00:32:27.140 --> 00:32:31.250 align:middle line:84%
past, parallel presents,
potential futures,

00:32:31.250 --> 00:32:33.770 align:middle line:90%
other types of records as well.

00:32:33.770 --> 00:32:37.420 align:middle line:84%
We can visit anywhere,
anywhen, time and space.

00:32:37.420 --> 00:32:39.020 align:middle line:84%
Time and space
don't really exist.

00:32:39.020 --> 00:32:40.840 align:middle line:90%
They two are really collapsed.

00:32:40.840 --> 00:32:45.610 align:middle line:84%
But we can still pretend to
be the shamans that we already

00:32:45.610 --> 00:32:48.830 align:middle line:84%
are and visit another
planet, visit another world,

00:32:48.830 --> 00:32:49.630 align:middle line:90%
another dimension.

00:32:49.630 --> 00:32:50.588 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Another time.

00:32:50.588 --> 00:32:51.560 align:middle line:90%
>>DALE: Another time.

00:32:51.560 --> 00:32:53.542 align:middle line:90%
Everything like that.

00:32:53.542 --> 00:32:56.170 align:middle line:84%
And a lot of what
we carry forward

00:32:56.170 --> 00:33:00.440 align:middle line:84%
into a particular lifetime
will relate to a chakra

00:33:00.440 --> 00:33:02.350 align:middle line:84%
because it relates
to our soul, and it's

00:33:02.350 --> 00:33:06.580 align:middle line:84%
our soul that's having these
experiences in order to grow,

00:33:06.580 --> 00:33:11.440 align:middle line:84%
in order to exercise its
divine right to create,

00:33:11.440 --> 00:33:12.990 align:middle line:84%
to figure out who
it is and what it

00:33:12.990 --> 00:33:18.090 align:middle line:84%
wants to make and do some
cross-learning in relationships

00:33:18.090 --> 00:33:19.000 align:middle line:90%
as well.

00:33:19.000 --> 00:33:22.110 align:middle line:84%
So it's a very important
chakra when it comes to--

00:33:22.110 --> 00:33:23.380 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: 21 to 28.

00:33:23.380 --> 00:33:24.190 align:middle line:90%
>>DALE: 21 to 28.

00:33:24.190 --> 00:33:24.990 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:33:24.990 --> 00:33:27.070 align:middle line:10%
>>REGINA: And then let's
go to the ninth chakra.

00:33:27.070 --> 00:33:29.820 align:middle line:90%
>>DALE: Ninth, 28 to 35.

00:33:29.820 --> 00:33:30.730 align:middle line:90%
It's gold.

00:33:30.730 --> 00:33:31.960 align:middle line:90%
It's above the head.

00:33:31.960 --> 00:33:33.670 align:middle line:90%
It has many functions.

00:33:33.670 --> 00:33:35.083 align:middle line:90%
It's a harmonic chakra.

00:33:35.083 --> 00:33:36.750 align:middle line:84%
In other cultures,
these chakras show up

00:33:36.750 --> 00:33:40.380 align:middle line:84%
in other cultures as well,
non-Hindu and non-Sindhi

00:33:40.380 --> 00:33:41.460 align:middle line:90%
culture.

00:33:41.460 --> 00:33:44.350 align:middle line:84%
But the ninth is always
seen as an over spirit.

00:33:44.350 --> 00:33:47.160 align:middle line:84%
So it's very much about
harmonizing, connecting

00:33:47.160 --> 00:33:49.630 align:middle line:84%
with the greater
universe, with love,

00:33:49.630 --> 00:33:52.630 align:middle line:84%
with goodness, with
spirit, with oneness.

00:33:52.630 --> 00:33:57.670 align:middle line:84%
I also perceive it as having
symbols or codes unique to us.

00:33:57.670 --> 00:33:59.320 align:middle line:90%
I think they're quantum codes.

00:33:59.320 --> 00:34:01.140 align:middle line:84%
A lot of interesting
studies in--

00:34:01.140 --> 00:34:03.970 align:middle line:84%
called wave genetics
or quantum codes,

00:34:03.970 --> 00:34:06.610 align:middle line:84%
where we have codes
that are very particular

00:34:06.610 --> 00:34:08.400 align:middle line:84%
and we need to bring
them into our system

00:34:08.400 --> 00:34:10.030 align:middle line:90%
to be able to be healthy.

00:34:10.030 --> 00:34:12.850 align:middle line:84%
And I believe those are
in the ninth chakra.

00:34:12.850 --> 00:34:15.909 align:middle line:84%
So we want to bring
them down and in.

00:34:15.909 --> 00:34:20.610 align:middle line:84%
And so we start to do
that between 28 to 25.

00:34:20.610 --> 00:34:24.330 align:middle line:84%
We're a little bit more about
who I am and looking at maybe,

00:34:24.330 --> 00:34:26.199 align:middle line:90%
what's my place in the world?

00:34:26.199 --> 00:34:29.080 align:middle line:84%
Is there something I'm
called to more fully be?

00:34:29.080 --> 00:34:31.810 align:middle line:84%
Now the reason the 10th is the
10th underneath the ground--

00:34:31.810 --> 00:34:32.980 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Yeah, how come it
drops down to the ground?

00:34:32.980 --> 00:34:34.510 align:middle line:84%
>>DALE: Why don't
we ground ourselves?

00:34:34.510 --> 00:34:35.310 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: OK.

00:34:35.310 --> 00:34:36.550 align:middle line:90%
>>DALE: Let's be who we are.

00:34:36.550 --> 00:34:36.900 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: OK.

00:34:36.900 --> 00:34:37.700 align:middle line:90%
>>DALE: Yeah.

00:34:37.700 --> 00:34:40.913 align:middle line:84%
Let's bring it to the
value of the planet.

00:34:40.913 --> 00:34:42.663 align:middle line:84%
If you just keep
going off the ninth,

00:34:42.663 --> 00:34:44.080 align:middle line:84%
you're just going
to float around.

00:34:44.080 --> 00:34:46.120 align:middle line:84%
Not a lot of
accomplishments out there.

00:34:46.120 --> 00:34:49.290 align:middle line:84%
Great place to meditate
on Mars, but not

00:34:49.290 --> 00:34:52.780 align:middle line:84%
to impact the earth in our own
lives and our loved ones either.

00:34:52.780 --> 00:34:54.300 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So it's
taking all of that

00:34:54.300 --> 00:34:56.950 align:middle line:84%
and grounding it into our
third dimensional reality.

00:34:56.950 --> 00:34:57.750 align:middle line:90%
>>DALE: Exactly.

00:34:57.750 --> 00:35:01.820 align:middle line:84%
And becoming that being
who can make a difference,

00:35:01.820 --> 00:35:03.090 align:middle line:90%
however we're called.

00:35:03.090 --> 00:35:04.590 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: OK, now we move on.

00:35:04.590 --> 00:35:06.810 align:middle line:84%
So we go back up
here to the 11th.

00:35:06.810 --> 00:35:09.160 align:middle line:84%
>>DALE: Well, 11th is
also the hand and feet.

00:35:09.160 --> 00:35:09.960 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: OK.

00:35:09.960 --> 00:35:12.240 align:middle line:84%
>>DALE: The 11th is
out in the field.

00:35:12.240 --> 00:35:17.060 align:middle line:84%
I see it as rose, which is a
mix of spirit and physicality,

00:35:17.060 --> 00:35:18.750 align:middle line:90%
and around the hand and feet.

00:35:18.750 --> 00:35:22.470 align:middle line:84%
And I just wish people knew
they had an 11th chakra.

00:35:22.470 --> 00:35:24.800 align:middle line:90%
It's a commanding chakra.

00:35:24.800 --> 00:35:27.320 align:middle line:84%
I really tuned in to it
doing some investigations

00:35:27.320 --> 00:35:30.800 align:middle line:84%
in other cultures and other
parts of the world with shamans

00:35:30.800 --> 00:35:34.460 align:middle line:84%
who could change the
weather or raise somebody up

00:35:34.460 --> 00:35:35.760 align:middle line:90%
who couldn't walk.

00:35:35.760 --> 00:35:43.610 align:middle line:84%
Really interesting studies and
that familial and cultural use

00:35:43.610 --> 00:35:46.770 align:middle line:84%
of the ability to command
natural and supernatural forces.

00:35:46.770 --> 00:35:50.850 align:middle line:84%
I believe we all have that
ability to various degrees.

00:35:50.850 --> 00:35:54.740 align:middle line:84%
And I think a lot of
politicians use it.

00:35:54.740 --> 00:35:56.370 align:middle line:90%
A lot of leaders use it.

00:35:56.370 --> 00:35:59.040 align:middle line:84%
They may not know that
they're using it, though.

00:35:59.040 --> 00:36:03.470 align:middle line:84%
They just have power
and leadership, but--

00:36:03.470 --> 00:36:05.970 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: In the wrong hands,
it's just a mass manipulation.

00:36:05.970 --> 00:36:06.470 align:middle line:90%
>>DALE: Literally.

00:36:06.470 --> 00:36:06.900 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:36:06.900 --> 00:36:07.590 align:middle line:90%
>>DALE: Literally.

00:36:07.590 --> 00:36:09.360 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Literally
a mass manipulation.

00:36:09.360 --> 00:36:09.560 align:middle line:90%
>>DALE: Yeah.

00:36:09.560 --> 00:36:11.143 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: OK, so
let's go to the 12th.

00:36:11.143 --> 00:36:13.440 align:middle line:84%
>>DALE: The 12th is
unique to each of us.

00:36:13.440 --> 00:36:14.880 align:middle line:90%
It makes me smile.

00:36:14.880 --> 00:36:18.230 align:middle line:84%
I believe that we can get to
it in the innermost chamber

00:36:18.230 --> 00:36:22.010 align:middle line:84%
of our heart where you could
say we indwell with the greater

00:36:22.010 --> 00:36:26.130 align:middle line:84%
spirit, and then it's in our
energy field on the outside.

00:36:26.130 --> 00:36:29.370 align:middle line:84%
And I think it blurs
through the energy egg.

00:36:29.370 --> 00:36:31.760 align:middle line:84%
A lot of cultures
see the outward bound

00:36:31.760 --> 00:36:34.550 align:middle line:90%
of who we are as an energy egg.

00:36:34.550 --> 00:36:39.470 align:middle line:84%
But it blurs beyond that
into greater and other spaces

00:36:39.470 --> 00:36:42.330 align:middle line:90%
of very beautiful sorts.

00:36:42.330 --> 00:36:47.360 align:middle line:84%
And so I believe our 12th
chakra self has very unique

00:36:47.360 --> 00:36:49.700 align:middle line:90%
capabilities and gifts.

00:36:49.700 --> 00:36:51.030 align:middle line:90%
We are unique.

00:36:51.030 --> 00:36:54.030 align:middle line:84%
It's the whole
snowflake modality.

00:36:54.030 --> 00:36:56.100 align:middle line:84%
So what do I have
this really different?

00:36:56.100 --> 00:36:58.018 align:middle line:84%
What can I bring to
myself in the world?

00:36:58.018 --> 00:36:59.810 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: What's in
your original template?

00:36:59.810 --> 00:37:01.435 align:middle line:84%
>>DALE: What's in my
original template?

00:37:01.435 --> 00:37:04.370 align:middle line:90%
This unlike anyone else's.

00:37:04.370 --> 00:37:05.200 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Exactly.

00:37:05.200 --> 00:37:08.110 align:middle line:84%
OK, so now we're going to
go retrograde for a moment

00:37:08.110 --> 00:37:11.890 align:middle line:84%
and look at what happens to us
in the subtle body level when

00:37:11.890 --> 00:37:14.090 align:middle line:84%
we're exposed to
trauma, for example,

00:37:14.090 --> 00:37:18.490 align:middle line:84%
trauma, cruelty, even
confusion to the point

00:37:18.490 --> 00:37:20.090 align:middle line:90%
of cognitive dissonance.

00:37:20.090 --> 00:37:22.760 align:middle line:10%
And then because it leads on, we
don't have very much time left,

00:37:22.760 --> 00:37:24.140 align:middle line:10%
so we have to get right to it.

00:37:24.140 --> 00:37:26.500 align:middle line:84%
Where the body, you
say, it can even

00:37:26.500 --> 00:37:29.020 align:middle line:84%
affect us on an autoimmune
level and the body can even

00:37:29.020 --> 00:37:30.800 align:middle line:90%
start attacking itself.

00:37:30.800 --> 00:37:32.690 align:middle line:84%
It's been attacked
from the outside.

00:37:32.690 --> 00:37:36.140 align:middle line:84%
So let's get into that and wrap
it up and how we can fix it.

00:37:36.140 --> 00:37:39.170 align:middle line:84%
>>DALE: Bottom line, any time
something's coming at us,

00:37:39.170 --> 00:37:41.132 align:middle line:84%
and that's the original
source of trauma.

00:37:41.132 --> 00:37:43.340 align:middle line:84%
It comes at us and we can
start beating ourselves up,

00:37:43.340 --> 00:37:43.900 align:middle line:90%
of course, too.

00:37:43.900 --> 00:37:44.700 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:37:44.700 --> 00:37:47.050 align:middle line:84%
>>DALE: It interfaces
with us with forces--

00:37:47.050 --> 00:37:52.330 align:middle line:84%
environmental, physical,
emotional, verbal, spiritual,

00:37:52.330 --> 00:37:57.390 align:middle line:84%
like entities, forces, digital,
what we're getting even

00:37:57.390 --> 00:37:58.860 align:middle line:90%
on the emails were not reading.

00:37:58.860 --> 00:38:02.200 align:middle line:84%
And any of those forces,
which we really can't measure,

00:38:02.200 --> 00:38:05.610 align:middle line:84%
carry energetic
charges, or they can.

00:38:05.610 --> 00:38:09.030 align:middle line:84%
If those subtle energetic
charges enter us

00:38:09.030 --> 00:38:12.720 align:middle line:84%
at any level, our physical
self, but any of our subtle,

00:38:12.720 --> 00:38:13.690 align:middle line:90%
most of us is subtle.

00:38:13.690 --> 00:38:15.882 align:middle line:90%
99.999% of us is subtle.

00:38:15.882 --> 00:38:16.840 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Subtle, yeah.

00:38:16.840 --> 00:38:19.120 align:middle line:84%
>>DALE: We can't
heal what's not ours.

00:38:19.120 --> 00:38:22.020 align:middle line:84%
Somebody else's emotions
can get lodged in us.

00:38:22.020 --> 00:38:23.580 align:middle line:90%
How do we get rid of that?

00:38:23.580 --> 00:38:26.820 align:middle line:84%
Literally, the immune system
may start to try to get rid

00:38:26.820 --> 00:38:27.700 align:middle line:90%
of somebody else's--

00:38:27.700 --> 00:38:29.280 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Because it
doesn't know the difference

00:38:29.280 --> 00:38:30.770 align:middle line:90%
between if it's yours or else.

00:38:30.770 --> 00:38:31.570 align:middle line:90%
>>DALE: It doesn't.

00:38:31.570 --> 00:38:32.370 align:middle line:90%
It doesn't.

00:38:32.370 --> 00:38:33.750 align:middle line:90%
So it starts attacking.

00:38:33.750 --> 00:38:36.340 align:middle line:84%
But you can't free
what's not yours.

00:38:36.340 --> 00:38:40.210 align:middle line:84%
You can release it, but you
have to be conscious about it.

00:38:40.210 --> 00:38:42.000 align:middle line:84%
You have to know,
hey, something's

00:38:42.000 --> 00:38:43.560 align:middle line:90%
in me that's not mine.

00:38:43.560 --> 00:38:45.520 align:middle line:84%
I'm going to take
a few deep breaths.

00:38:45.520 --> 00:38:48.480 align:middle line:84%
I want to ask myself, my
spirit, my soul, my body

00:38:48.480 --> 00:38:51.670 align:middle line:84%
to release these energetic
charges that are harmful.

00:38:51.670 --> 00:38:54.850 align:middle line:84%
So I can only deal
with my own issues,

00:38:54.850 --> 00:38:56.710 align:middle line:90%
and I will deal with those.

00:38:56.710 --> 00:38:59.400 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And finally,
we get to our bodies

00:38:59.400 --> 00:39:03.910 align:middle line:84%
are actually experiencing
and responding to the future.

00:39:03.910 --> 00:39:04.980 align:middle line:90%
>>DALE: They are.

00:39:04.980 --> 00:39:05.780 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: OK.

00:39:05.780 --> 00:39:07.390 align:middle line:84%
>>DALE: Quantum
physics in the future.

00:39:07.390 --> 00:39:09.660 align:middle line:90%
It's all blended, first of all.

00:39:09.660 --> 00:39:11.500 align:middle line:84%
There's many, many
Sindhis out there,

00:39:11.500 --> 00:39:14.320 align:middle line:84%
but there's probably a
most likely path as well.

00:39:14.320 --> 00:39:17.580 align:middle line:84%
And that most likely path,
because time has collapsed,

00:39:17.580 --> 00:39:19.600 align:middle line:90%
draws me into it.

00:39:19.600 --> 00:39:22.320 align:middle line:84%
But that's dependent on the
programs that I have right now

00:39:22.320 --> 00:39:24.150 align:middle line:84%
and how I'm being
right now, which

00:39:24.150 --> 00:39:28.210 align:middle line:84%
is highly dependent on what I've
been in many, many branchings.

00:39:28.210 --> 00:39:31.500 align:middle line:84%
So the other way that we
can impact that future

00:39:31.500 --> 00:39:34.680 align:middle line:84%
is once we clear
history, once we

00:39:34.680 --> 00:39:37.080 align:middle line:84%
stand in the
present, which can be

00:39:37.080 --> 00:39:39.010 align:middle line:84%
just stand in the middle
of your heart chakra,

00:39:39.010 --> 00:39:41.020 align:middle line:84%
stand in the middle
of your third eye

00:39:41.020 --> 00:39:44.430 align:middle line:84%
and start to project what
would be better to create,

00:39:44.430 --> 00:39:48.280 align:middle line:84%
that lands in the future
and calls you to it as well.

00:39:48.280 --> 00:39:50.310 align:middle line:90%
So we can influence the future.

00:39:50.310 --> 00:39:54.900 align:middle line:84%
I don't think we need to
be too Pollyanna about it.

00:39:54.900 --> 00:39:56.250 align:middle line:90%
Things are going to happen.

00:39:56.250 --> 00:39:59.550 align:middle line:84%
We're in a planet where
stuff muddles around,

00:39:59.550 --> 00:40:02.910 align:middle line:84%
but we can influence it
because we are anyway.

00:40:02.910 --> 00:40:05.450 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And this gets us
really to the notion of what's

00:40:05.450 --> 00:40:07.430 align:middle line:84%
being bandied about
all the time now,

00:40:07.430 --> 00:40:11.518 align:middle line:84%
being called parallel timelines,
which are just potentials.

00:40:11.518 --> 00:40:12.810 align:middle line:90%
>>DALE: They're all potentials.

00:40:12.810 --> 00:40:15.590 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Every parallel
timeline is just a potential

00:40:15.590 --> 00:40:17.750 align:middle line:84%
deciding on how
we're taking on what

00:40:17.750 --> 00:40:20.850 align:middle line:84%
we're being exposed to, what's
being asked of us in the moment.

00:40:20.850 --> 00:40:23.570 align:middle line:84%
Like you said, there is
a probable trajectory

00:40:23.570 --> 00:40:25.200 align:middle line:90%
for this version of Cyndi.

00:40:25.200 --> 00:40:26.000 align:middle line:90%
>>DALE: Exactly.

00:40:26.000 --> 00:40:29.030 align:middle line:84%
And parallel realities,
whatever I don't do

00:40:29.030 --> 00:40:31.080 align:middle line:84%
spins off even just
for a split second,

00:40:31.080 --> 00:40:32.700 align:middle line:90%
but then something spins off.

00:40:32.700 --> 00:40:36.110 align:middle line:84%
It feeds a bigger idea
of there's many worlds,

00:40:36.110 --> 00:40:38.540 align:middle line:90%
and so why not start choosing?

00:40:38.540 --> 00:40:40.550 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Why not become
consciously engaged

00:40:40.550 --> 00:40:41.430 align:middle line:90%
in the outcomes?

00:40:41.430 --> 00:40:41.580 align:middle line:90%
>>DALE: Yes.

00:40:41.580 --> 00:40:42.380 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Exactly.

00:40:42.380 --> 00:40:45.020 align:middle line:84%
And instead of just reacting,
not even responding,

00:40:45.020 --> 00:40:47.610 align:middle line:84%
reacting to everything that
we're being exposed to?

00:40:47.610 --> 00:40:49.700 align:middle line:84%
And right now, it
seems that the world

00:40:49.700 --> 00:40:52.870 align:middle line:84%
is an incredibly reactionary
mode, the entire planet.

00:40:52.870 --> 00:40:53.670 align:middle line:90%
>>DALE: It is.

00:40:53.670 --> 00:40:55.170 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: The
emotions are inflamed,

00:40:55.170 --> 00:40:57.770 align:middle line:84%
but there is a higher
consciousness that's

00:40:57.770 --> 00:41:00.530 align:middle line:84%
sweeping through,
and we're just trying

00:41:00.530 --> 00:41:03.750 align:middle line:84%
to catch up on in the
world of thought and mind.

00:41:03.750 --> 00:41:06.110 align:middle line:10%
We can't really comprehend
what we're being exposed

00:41:06.110 --> 00:41:07.680 align:middle line:10%
to, except that it's good.

00:41:07.680 --> 00:41:10.160 align:middle line:10%
It's a very high
frequency compared

00:41:10.160 --> 00:41:12.720 align:middle line:10%
to where we've been-- what
we've been bathed in the past.

00:41:12.720 --> 00:41:15.960 align:middle line:84%
It's not just to Earth,
it's throughout the cosmos.

00:41:15.960 --> 00:41:18.680 align:middle line:84%
So we're just trying to figure
out how to contend with it.

00:41:18.680 --> 00:41:21.090 align:middle line:84%
Riff on that for just a
minute before we say goodbye.

00:41:21.090 --> 00:41:22.170 align:middle line:90%
>>DALE: Yes, cleansing.

00:41:22.170 --> 00:41:25.260 align:middle line:84%
And I think in times like these,
go back to self-responsibility.

00:41:25.260 --> 00:41:26.060 align:middle line:10%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:41:26.060 --> 00:41:26.970 align:middle line:10%
>>DALE: Who am I?

00:41:26.970 --> 00:41:29.070 align:middle line:90%
How do I be about oneness?

00:41:29.070 --> 00:41:31.880 align:middle line:84%
How do I be about what
I want to represent?

00:41:31.880 --> 00:41:34.880 align:middle line:84%
Because large and small
doesn't make a difference.

00:41:34.880 --> 00:41:38.070 align:middle line:84%
The Star Wars,
Yoda's training Luke.

00:41:38.070 --> 00:41:41.070 align:middle line:84%
He can juggle whatever it
was, rocks, can't lift a ship.

00:41:41.070 --> 00:41:44.000 align:middle line:84%
Yoda's like, you're
a luminary being.

00:41:44.000 --> 00:41:46.680 align:middle line:84%
If you can do a small thing,
you can do a big thing.

00:41:46.680 --> 00:41:48.030 align:middle line:90%
We can do the small things.

00:41:48.030 --> 00:41:49.345 align:middle line:90%
We're doing the big things.

00:41:49.345 --> 00:41:51.470 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And we're opening
up to our capabilities.

00:41:51.470 --> 00:41:53.810 align:middle line:84%
A lot of the little people
being born right now,

00:41:53.810 --> 00:41:56.080 align:middle line:84%
I find absolutely
fascinating what

00:41:56.080 --> 00:41:58.210 align:middle line:84%
they know from such a
young age and the way

00:41:58.210 --> 00:42:00.640 align:middle line:84%
they can speak with a
certain amount of sovereignty

00:42:00.640 --> 00:42:02.270 align:middle line:90%
by the time they can speak.

00:42:02.270 --> 00:42:03.560 align:middle line:90%
This is fascinating.

00:42:03.560 --> 00:42:05.800 align:middle line:84%
So I really think a
lot of our capabilities

00:42:05.800 --> 00:42:08.680 align:middle line:84%
that are embedded within
our original template

00:42:08.680 --> 00:42:11.150 align:middle line:84%
are now starting to
be able to surface.

00:42:11.150 --> 00:42:12.400 align:middle line:90%
>>DALE: I agree, I totally.

00:42:12.400 --> 00:42:12.830 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:42:12.830 --> 00:42:13.990 align:middle line:84%
>>DALE: We're all helping
each other do that.

00:42:13.990 --> 00:42:15.032 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: And we're all--

00:42:15.032 --> 00:42:16.190 align:middle line:90%
so final thoughts.

00:42:16.190 --> 00:42:17.160 align:middle line:90%
>>DALE: Joy.

00:42:17.160 --> 00:42:17.960 align:middle line:90%
Joy.

00:42:17.960 --> 00:42:19.360 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:42:19.360 --> 00:42:22.370 align:middle line:84%
>>DALE: It's still good
to go, OK, in this moment,

00:42:22.370 --> 00:42:24.140 align:middle line:90%
what version of joy can I own?

00:42:24.140 --> 00:42:28.940 align:middle line:10%
It could be relief,
satisfaction, a good job done.

00:42:28.940 --> 00:42:30.317 align:middle line:10%
>>REGINA: I agree with you.

00:42:30.317 --> 00:42:31.900 align:middle line:10%
>>DALE: Ecstasy, but
it doesn't always

00:42:31.900 --> 00:42:33.860 align:middle line:10%
have to be like, oh,
let's just aim for bliss

00:42:33.860 --> 00:42:38.740 align:middle line:10%
because that's not really where
most of us usually vibrate.

00:42:38.740 --> 00:42:42.188 align:middle line:84%
But any version of joy is a
good thing to offer ourselves.

00:42:42.188 --> 00:42:43.730 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Thank you
so much for that.

00:42:43.730 --> 00:42:44.720 align:middle line:90%
I couldn't agree more.

00:42:44.720 --> 00:42:47.410 align:middle line:84%
I mean, how can you
possibly have the energy

00:42:47.410 --> 00:42:49.330 align:middle line:84%
to navigate all of
this if you're not

00:42:49.330 --> 00:42:50.660 align:middle line:90%
having some fun along the way?

00:42:50.660 --> 00:42:51.650 align:middle line:90%
You have to.

00:42:51.650 --> 00:42:52.450 align:middle line:10%
Joy.

00:42:52.450 --> 00:42:54.330 align:middle line:10%
Enjoy is a better word than fun.

00:42:54.330 --> 00:42:56.530 align:middle line:10%
Joy can be very
subtle, like you say.

00:42:56.530 --> 00:42:58.233 align:middle line:90%
Like, I'm happy I did that well.

00:42:58.233 --> 00:42:59.900 align:middle line:84%
I followed through
on what I said I was.

00:42:59.900 --> 00:43:01.690 align:middle line:84%
That's a subtle
sense of joy, so is

00:43:01.690 --> 00:43:04.160 align:middle line:84%
having a beautiful,
salted caramel ice cream.

00:43:04.160 --> 00:43:05.540 align:middle line:90%
>>DALE: Oh, very much.

00:43:05.540 --> 00:43:08.930 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So is petting your
little dog, our favorite pet.

00:43:08.930 --> 00:43:10.790 align:middle line:90%
So yes, I agree with you.

00:43:10.790 --> 00:43:12.440 align:middle line:10%
Joy, that's where it's at.

00:43:12.440 --> 00:43:13.830 align:middle line:90%
That gives us energy.

00:43:13.830 --> 00:43:14.630 align:middle line:90%
>>DALE: It does.

00:43:14.630 --> 00:43:15.140 align:middle line:90%
Thank you.

00:43:15.140 --> 00:43:16.598 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Thank
you so much, Cyndi.

00:43:16.598 --> 00:43:19.190 align:middle line:84%
Good to have you here and share
with us about the 10th chakra.

00:43:19.190 --> 00:43:20.630 align:middle line:90%
That's really interesting.

00:43:20.630 --> 00:43:23.230 align:middle line:84%
And it'll be interesting to see
how you and grandma come back

00:43:23.230 --> 00:43:25.060 align:middle line:90%
around.

00:43:25.060 --> 00:43:27.518 align:middle line:84%
Cyndi is an energizer
bunny, as you can tell,

00:43:27.518 --> 00:43:29.560 align:middle line:84%
and she's written many
wonderful books, which you

00:43:29.560 --> 00:43:31.490 align:middle line:90%
can find via major booksellers.

00:43:31.490 --> 00:43:34.810 align:middle line:10%
Again, the title of this book
is Transforming The Legacy,

00:43:34.810 --> 00:43:36.730 align:middle line:10%
The Subtle Body
Approach to Honor

00:43:36.730 --> 00:43:38.630 align:middle line:10%
and Heal Your Inherited Lineage.

00:43:38.630 --> 00:43:42.640 align:middle line:84%
Until next time, thank you for
joining us here on Open Minds.
