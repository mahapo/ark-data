>>REGINA MEREDITH: We spend a
third of our lives sleeping.

00:00:23.840 --> 00:00:27.080 align:middle line:10%
What if we could use that time
to expand our consciousness,

00:00:27.080 --> 00:00:29.000 align:middle line:10%
problem solve, create?

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:31.850 align:middle line:10%
Charlie Morley says that,
if we can consciously

00:00:31.850 --> 00:00:35.240 align:middle line:10%
engage with our dreams, an
entire world opens up to us

00:00:35.240 --> 00:00:37.430 align:middle line:10%
to both play in and heal in.

00:00:37.430 --> 00:00:40.810 align:middle line:84%
Lucidity in dreams means greater
lucidity in our daily lives.

00:00:40.810 --> 00:00:42.440 align:middle line:90%
First of all, welcome, Charlie.

00:00:42.440 --> 00:00:43.940 align:middle line:10%
I love the subject of dreams.

00:00:43.940 --> 00:00:46.730 align:middle line:10%
And we're going to start out
with the big question first.

00:00:46.730 --> 00:00:48.840 align:middle line:84%
And then, we'll kind of
back-engineer the story

00:00:48.840 --> 00:00:49.640 align:middle line:90%
from there.

00:00:49.640 --> 00:00:50.370 align:middle line:84%
>>CHARLIE MORLEY:
Sounds good to me.

00:00:50.370 --> 00:00:51.661 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: The big question is--

00:00:51.661 --> 00:00:53.870 align:middle line:84%
some people and some
ancient traditions

00:00:53.870 --> 00:00:57.980 align:middle line:84%
believe this is the dream and
that that is our real life.

00:00:57.980 --> 00:00:59.420 align:middle line:90%
What do you think about that?

00:00:59.420 --> 00:01:02.810 align:middle line:84%
>>MORLEY: Big question-- I
can't say for sure whether this

00:01:02.810 --> 00:01:04.190 align:middle line:90%
is all a dream-like illusion.

00:01:04.190 --> 00:01:06.410 align:middle line:10%
And when we go to sleep,
it's less of a dream or more

00:01:06.410 --> 00:01:06.740 align:middle line:10%
of a dream.

00:01:06.740 --> 00:01:09.115 align:middle line:10%
And when we die, it's less of
a dream or more of a dream.

00:01:09.115 --> 00:01:10.080 align:middle line:90%
I don't know.

00:01:10.080 --> 00:01:12.650 align:middle line:84%
But what I do know is,
the same rule applies.

00:01:12.650 --> 00:01:15.140 align:middle line:84%
Right now, if this were
a lucid dream rather than

00:01:15.140 --> 00:01:18.370 align:middle line:84%
waking reality, I would know
that you are part of me.

00:01:18.370 --> 00:01:19.874 align:middle line:84%
That you are not
separate from me.

00:01:19.874 --> 00:01:21.290 align:middle line:84%
And because you're
part of me, I'm

00:01:21.290 --> 00:01:24.290 align:middle line:84%
going to give you all of my
attention and all of my love.

00:01:24.290 --> 00:01:26.160 align:middle line:84%
So I think the
same rule applies.

00:01:26.160 --> 00:01:28.210 align:middle line:84%
If we can show love
in the waking state,

00:01:28.210 --> 00:01:30.980 align:middle line:84%
love in the dream state, and
love and the after death state,

00:01:30.980 --> 00:01:32.390 align:middle line:90%
then we cover all bases.

00:01:32.390 --> 00:01:34.250 align:middle line:10%
Because love is the
most powerful force

00:01:34.250 --> 00:01:35.310 align:middle line:10%
there is in the universe.

00:01:35.310 --> 00:01:37.310 align:middle line:10%
So I don't know what's
the dream and what's not.

00:01:37.310 --> 00:01:39.643 align:middle line:10%
But I know that I'm going to
show love as much as I can.

00:01:39.643 --> 00:01:41.480 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Well,
what's interesting is,

00:01:41.480 --> 00:01:45.380 align:middle line:84%
if this what we call daily
life is but a dream--

00:01:45.380 --> 00:01:48.440 align:middle line:84%
as some traditions believe,
that when we're out of the body

00:01:48.440 --> 00:01:50.240 align:middle line:90%
we're our true selves--

00:01:50.240 --> 00:01:54.350 align:middle line:84%
then we could treat life
with so much more adventure.

00:01:54.350 --> 00:01:57.830 align:middle line:84%
We could experiment and
create and play more.

00:01:57.830 --> 00:02:01.220 align:middle line:84%
But because we think this is
it, this is all we've got,

00:02:01.220 --> 00:02:03.140 align:middle line:90%
we take it so seriously.

00:02:03.140 --> 00:02:05.810 align:middle line:84%
And we really cut
off our creativity

00:02:05.810 --> 00:02:07.310 align:middle line:84%
and don't take the
chances we would

00:02:07.310 --> 00:02:08.839 align:middle line:90%
take if we saw it otherwise.

00:02:08.839 --> 00:02:11.724 align:middle line:10%
>>MORLEY: Exactly-- so my
teacher, Lama Yeshe Rinpoche,

00:02:11.724 --> 00:02:13.890 align:middle line:10%
who's the abbot of Samye
Ling Monastery in Scotland,

00:02:13.890 --> 00:02:17.210 align:middle line:10%
the Tibetan refugee
from the '60s, '70s.

00:02:17.210 --> 00:02:20.330 align:middle line:10%
He said that one of the greatest
benefits of lucid dreaming--

00:02:20.330 --> 00:02:23.000 align:middle line:10%
so the art of training the
mind to become conscious within

00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:23.900 align:middle line:10%
your dreams--

00:02:23.900 --> 00:02:26.690 align:middle line:10%
is that it gives you a
better sense of humor.

00:02:26.690 --> 00:02:29.210 align:middle line:84%
And out of all these amazing
kind of Tibetan Buddhist things

00:02:29.210 --> 00:02:31.535 align:middle line:84%
where it said to train yourself
for the moment of death

00:02:31.535 --> 00:02:33.410 align:middle line:84%
and do your spiritual
practice in your sleep,

00:02:33.410 --> 00:02:36.320 align:middle line:84%
he said the best thing is, it
gives you a sense of humor.

00:02:36.320 --> 00:02:38.030 align:middle line:84%
Because in a lucid
dream, you can

00:02:38.030 --> 00:02:41.330 align:middle line:84%
interact with things that
seem as real as this.

00:02:41.330 --> 00:02:44.026 align:middle line:84%
In a lucid dream, I can
touch the lucid dream chair.

00:02:44.026 --> 00:02:45.150 align:middle line:90%
And it will feel like this.

00:02:45.150 --> 00:02:48.360 align:middle line:84%
It will have the same
texture as this material.

00:02:48.360 --> 00:02:49.640 align:middle line:90%
I can touch my arm.

00:02:49.640 --> 00:02:52.530 align:middle line:84%
And I can even notice
the hairs on my arm.

00:02:52.530 --> 00:02:56.360 align:middle line:84%
So I see that the human
mind has a huge potential

00:02:56.360 --> 00:02:58.880 align:middle line:90%
to create dreamlike illusion.

00:02:58.880 --> 00:03:00.470 align:middle line:84%
This means that
the next time I'm

00:03:00.470 --> 00:03:03.170 align:middle line:84%
in the waking state,
whatever that means,

00:03:03.170 --> 00:03:06.800 align:middle line:84%
I can also interact with this
dream with a similar sense

00:03:06.800 --> 00:03:08.420 align:middle line:90%
of flexibility.

00:03:08.420 --> 00:03:10.700 align:middle line:84%
One of the trainings is
to walk through walls

00:03:10.700 --> 00:03:12.137 align:middle line:90%
in your lucid dreams.

00:03:12.137 --> 00:03:13.970 align:middle line:84%
Now, for ages, I thought
this was a practice

00:03:13.970 --> 00:03:16.880 align:middle line:84%
so eventually you can walk
through walls in this state.

00:03:16.880 --> 00:03:18.830 align:middle line:84%
What I now realize is,
the reason my teacher

00:03:18.830 --> 00:03:22.220 align:middle line:84%
was training me to do that was
because nothing seems to be

00:03:22.220 --> 00:03:24.530 align:middle line:90%
more solid than a brick wall.

00:03:24.530 --> 00:03:26.750 align:middle line:84%
So if in the lucid
dream state you

00:03:26.750 --> 00:03:29.510 align:middle line:84%
can train yourself to
walk through a brick wall,

00:03:29.510 --> 00:03:32.300 align:middle line:84%
you're creating a new
habit of mind that says--

00:03:32.300 --> 00:03:36.110 align:middle line:84%
things that seem to be
solid are not always so.

00:03:36.110 --> 00:03:38.240 align:middle line:84%
So the next time you
confront the brick wall

00:03:38.240 --> 00:03:41.330 align:middle line:84%
of your own self-doubt in
the waking state, the brick

00:03:41.330 --> 00:03:44.360 align:middle line:84%
wall of your own poor me in
the waking state, the brick

00:03:44.360 --> 00:03:47.360 align:middle line:84%
wall of your own bull
in the waking state,

00:03:47.360 --> 00:03:51.740 align:middle line:84%
so too can you walk through that
and see it as as flexible as it

00:03:51.740 --> 00:03:53.060 align:middle line:90%
was in the lucid dream.

00:03:53.060 --> 00:03:54.650 align:middle line:84%
And this gives us
a sense of humor.

00:03:54.650 --> 00:03:55.700 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: It does.

00:03:55.700 --> 00:03:57.890 align:middle line:84%
And not only that,
you can practice.

00:03:57.890 --> 00:04:00.410 align:middle line:84%
There's nothing but
time and opportunity

00:04:00.410 --> 00:04:02.720 align:middle line:90%
in the dream world to practice.

00:04:02.720 --> 00:04:05.304 align:middle line:84%
And to work things
through, even--

00:04:05.304 --> 00:04:06.470 align:middle line:90%
we'll talk about this later.

00:04:06.470 --> 00:04:10.130 align:middle line:84%
Because as you say,
in your experience,

00:04:10.130 --> 00:04:12.080 align:middle line:84%
99% of what we
encounter is ourselves

00:04:12.080 --> 00:04:13.260 align:middle line:90%
in one degree or another.

00:04:13.260 --> 00:04:14.720 align:middle line:90%
But there's still that 1%.

00:04:14.720 --> 00:04:16.730 align:middle line:84%
And we still do
connect with others.

00:04:16.730 --> 00:04:21.709 align:middle line:84%
And we can practice and play out
into the future with ourselves

00:04:21.709 --> 00:04:22.630 align:middle line:90%
and with others.

00:04:22.630 --> 00:04:26.100 align:middle line:84%
So it's a wonderful
experimental ground, right.

00:04:26.100 --> 00:04:28.940 align:middle line:84%
And that should be reflected
in our daily life as one big--

00:04:28.940 --> 00:04:31.970 align:middle line:84%
I think Buckminster
Fuller said that he

00:04:31.970 --> 00:04:34.130 align:middle line:90%
was suicidal at one point.

00:04:34.130 --> 00:04:35.690 align:middle line:90%
He had failed at some things.

00:04:35.690 --> 00:04:40.100 align:middle line:84%
And finally, he realized
life is just an experiment.

00:04:40.100 --> 00:04:42.830 align:middle line:84%
I'm just going to make
everything an experiment.

00:04:42.830 --> 00:04:45.230 align:middle line:84%
Major contributions
to this planet.

00:04:45.230 --> 00:04:48.710 align:middle line:84%
But it was that attitude
that it's all an experiment.

00:04:48.710 --> 00:04:50.390 align:middle line:84%
And that's what I
love about the notion

00:04:50.390 --> 00:04:54.020 align:middle line:84%
of taking the lucid dream
state into the waking state.

00:04:54.020 --> 00:04:57.290 align:middle line:84%
So let's talk about where
lucid dreaming happens

00:04:57.290 --> 00:04:58.429 align:middle line:90%
on a physiological level.

00:04:58.429 --> 00:05:00.470 align:middle line:84%
We'll get into a little
bit in the science of it,

00:05:00.470 --> 00:05:02.660 align:middle line:84%
the prefrontal
cortex and so forth.

00:05:02.660 --> 00:05:06.230 align:middle line:84%
And how we can start tapping
into or waking that part up.

00:05:06.230 --> 00:05:08.300 align:middle line:84%
And then, we'll go into
the Tibetan dream yoga.

00:05:08.300 --> 00:05:10.508 align:middle line:84%
>>CHARLIE MORLEY: Absolutely--
so your question there

00:05:10.508 --> 00:05:12.560 align:middle line:84%
about training, using
the lucid dream state

00:05:12.560 --> 00:05:15.835 align:middle line:84%
as a rehearsal space for
the waking state, that's

00:05:15.835 --> 00:05:17.960 align:middle line:84%
been talked about in Tibetan
Buddhism for thousands

00:05:17.960 --> 00:05:18.760 align:middle line:90%
of years.

00:05:18.760 --> 00:05:20.407 align:middle line:84%
But now, we have
science to back it up.

00:05:20.407 --> 00:05:21.740 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Talk about some of it.

00:05:21.740 --> 00:05:24.210 align:middle line:84%
>>CHARLIE MORLEY: OK, so when
you are having a non-lucid

00:05:24.210 --> 00:05:25.010 align:middle line:90%
dream--

00:05:25.010 --> 00:05:27.385 align:middle line:84%
so your normal everyday dreams
where you're dreaming away

00:05:27.385 --> 00:05:28.910 align:middle line:90%
but don't know you're dreaming--

00:05:28.910 --> 00:05:30.815 align:middle line:84%
the back part of
the brain, the brain

00:05:30.815 --> 00:05:33.170 align:middle line:84%
stem, visual cortex
highly activated.

00:05:33.170 --> 00:05:35.000 align:middle line:84%
But the front part of
the brain, especially

00:05:35.000 --> 00:05:38.030 align:middle line:84%
the prefrontal cortex,
is deactivated.

00:05:38.030 --> 00:05:40.400 align:middle line:84%
And the prefrontal cortex,
scientists believe,

00:05:40.400 --> 00:05:43.450 align:middle line:84%
is where your sense of self
resides, your sense of agency.

00:05:43.450 --> 00:05:46.262 align:middle line:84%
Your sense of I am Charlie
having experience is

00:05:46.262 --> 00:05:47.470 align:middle line:90%
around the prefrontal cortex.

00:05:47.470 --> 00:05:49.520 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Right, and that's
where a lot of beta activity

00:05:49.520 --> 00:05:49.910 align:middle line:90%
happens.

00:05:49.910 --> 00:05:51.409 align:middle line:84%
And it's where we
go about our life.

00:05:51.409 --> 00:05:53.930 align:middle line:84%
Kind of a lot of left brain
activity and so forth as well.

00:05:53.930 --> 00:05:55.846 align:middle line:84%
>>MORLEY: Exactly-- now,
in a non-lucid dream,

00:05:55.846 --> 00:05:56.774 align:middle line:90%
that is de-activated.

00:05:56.774 --> 00:05:58.190 align:middle line:84%
Which is why you
can happily dream

00:05:58.190 --> 00:06:00.314 align:middle line:84%
that you are the queen of
Egypt and you believe it.

00:06:00.314 --> 00:06:02.856 align:middle line:84%
It's only when we wake up the
prefrontal cortex switches back

00:06:02.856 --> 00:06:03.655 align:middle line:90%
on.

00:06:03.655 --> 00:06:05.810 align:middle line:84%
And we go-- oh, I'm not
really the queen of Egypt.

00:06:05.810 --> 00:06:08.120 align:middle line:84%
I was dreaming I was
the queen of Egypt.

00:06:08.120 --> 00:06:10.700 align:middle line:84%
On that basis, when
we have a lucid dream,

00:06:10.700 --> 00:06:13.310 align:middle line:84%
we now know what part of
the brain is activated.

00:06:13.310 --> 00:06:15.044 align:middle line:84%
It is, of course, the
prefrontal cortex.

00:06:15.044 --> 00:06:17.210 align:middle line:84%
So you are dreaming away
you are the queen of Egypt.

00:06:17.210 --> 00:06:19.700 align:middle line:84%
And then, suddenly, prefrontal
cortex becomes engaged.

00:06:19.700 --> 00:06:22.100 align:middle line:84%
Ah, I'm not really
the queen of Egypt.

00:06:22.100 --> 00:06:25.020 align:middle line:84%
I'm having a lucid dream about
being the queen of Egypt.

00:06:25.020 --> 00:06:27.990 align:middle line:84%
Now, once that happens, not only
is your sense of self engaged.

00:06:27.990 --> 00:06:29.970 align:middle line:90%
So you can decide what to do.

00:06:29.970 --> 00:06:33.170 align:middle line:84%
But once the prefrontal
cortex is activated,

00:06:33.170 --> 00:06:36.290 align:middle line:84%
neuroplasticity
becomes activated too.

00:06:36.290 --> 00:06:38.750 align:middle line:84%
And this is where it
gets really interesting.

00:06:38.750 --> 00:06:40.940 align:middle line:84%
Neuroplasticity, of
course, the phenomena

00:06:40.940 --> 00:06:43.760 align:middle line:84%
of the brain to
rewire itself in favor

00:06:43.760 --> 00:06:46.580 align:middle line:90%
of a repeated action or habit.

00:06:46.580 --> 00:06:49.220 align:middle line:84%
Neurons that fire together wire
together-- the classic thing,

00:06:49.220 --> 00:06:50.020 align:middle line:90%
right.

00:06:50.020 --> 00:06:53.570 align:middle line:84%
Once you get lucid, what
you do in the lucid dream--

00:06:53.570 --> 00:06:55.850 align:middle line:84%
how you spend the
lucid dream-- actually

00:06:55.850 --> 00:06:59.360 align:middle line:84%
rewires your brain in
favor of that activity.

00:06:59.360 --> 00:07:02.360 align:middle line:84%
This means that you can
learn in your lucid dreams.

00:07:02.360 --> 00:07:05.330 align:middle line:84%
So interestingly, the first
people to put funding into this

00:07:05.330 --> 00:07:07.700 align:middle line:84%
were the German Sports
Science Association

00:07:07.700 --> 00:07:09.590 align:middle line:90%
at Heidelberg University.

00:07:09.590 --> 00:07:11.750 align:middle line:84%
Because they thought--
well, if you can actually

00:07:11.750 --> 00:07:14.000 align:middle line:84%
retrain your brain
through lucid dreaming,

00:07:14.000 --> 00:07:15.800 align:middle line:90%
what if we teach it to athletes?

00:07:15.800 --> 00:07:18.170 align:middle line:84%
So they did a big study,
over 100 athletes involved.

00:07:18.170 --> 00:07:19.700 align:middle line:84%
They whittled it
down to about 20

00:07:19.700 --> 00:07:22.790 align:middle line:84%
who could learn lucid dreaming,
spend a few months training

00:07:22.790 --> 00:07:25.857 align:middle line:84%
so they could have these
lucid dreams almost at will.

00:07:25.857 --> 00:07:27.440 align:middle line:84%
They put them into
the brain scanners.

00:07:27.440 --> 00:07:29.630 align:middle line:84%
They gave them all the
psychological tests.

00:07:29.630 --> 00:07:32.630 align:middle line:84%
Then, once they got lucid,
out of all the amazing things

00:07:32.630 --> 00:07:34.130 align:middle line:84%
they could do in
their lucid dream--

00:07:34.130 --> 00:07:37.430 align:middle line:84%
like meeting your inner
child and integrating trauma,

00:07:37.430 --> 00:07:40.850 align:middle line:84%
like working with stressful
situations in the daytime

00:07:40.850 --> 00:07:42.490 align:middle line:84%
and reframing them
through your dreams,

00:07:42.490 --> 00:07:46.180 align:middle line:84%
like meeting godhead, meeting
Buddha in your lucid dreams--

00:07:46.180 --> 00:07:48.914 align:middle line:90%
no, they were told to do squats.

00:07:48.914 --> 00:07:51.580 align:middle line:84%
So literally, in the lucid dream
they're dropping, doing squats.

00:07:51.580 --> 00:07:52.955 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Build
those quadriceps.

00:07:52.955 --> 00:07:53.889 align:middle line:90%
>>MORLEY: Exactly.

00:07:53.889 --> 00:07:56.180 align:middle line:84%
The next day, they put them
back in the brain scanners.

00:07:56.180 --> 00:07:58.580 align:middle line:84%
They gave them all the
psychological tests.

00:07:58.580 --> 00:08:00.560 align:middle line:84%
Long story short,
they found that they

00:08:00.560 --> 00:08:03.590 align:middle line:84%
could increase their
capacity to do squats

00:08:03.590 --> 00:08:05.630 align:middle line:90%
by training in the lucid dream.

00:08:05.630 --> 00:08:07.700 align:middle line:84%
Some of them actually
had increased

00:08:07.700 --> 00:08:10.542 align:middle line:84%
muscle mass due to the
training in the lucid dream.

00:08:10.542 --> 00:08:12.500 align:middle line:84%
Now of course, it's not
that their muscles were

00:08:12.500 --> 00:08:13.970 align:middle line:90%
growing in the lucid dream.

00:08:13.970 --> 00:08:16.190 align:middle line:84%
Because they were just
imagining doing it.

00:08:16.190 --> 00:08:18.860 align:middle line:84%
But they were strengthening
the neural pathways.

00:08:18.860 --> 00:08:20.600 align:middle line:84%
Which meant in the
waking state when

00:08:20.600 --> 00:08:22.880 align:middle line:84%
they did squats they
could do more of them.

00:08:22.880 --> 00:08:24.890 align:middle line:84%
And this led to
increased muscle mass.

00:08:24.890 --> 00:08:26.300 align:middle line:90%
So this is squats, right.

00:08:26.300 --> 00:08:29.120 align:middle line:84%
They did the same for
press-ups and stuff like that.

00:08:29.120 --> 00:08:30.050 align:middle line:90%
But so what?

00:08:30.050 --> 00:08:33.530 align:middle line:84%
We can get a nice bum and tum if
we work out in the lucid dream.

00:08:33.530 --> 00:08:36.770 align:middle line:84%
Imagine if we practice our
meditation in the lucid dream

00:08:36.770 --> 00:08:38.659 align:middle line:84%
and create those
neural pathways.

00:08:38.659 --> 00:08:40.820 align:middle line:84%
Imagine if we practice
love and kindness,

00:08:40.820 --> 00:08:43.640 align:middle line:84%
if we practice compassion, if
we practice being the person

00:08:43.640 --> 00:08:45.680 align:middle line:84%
that we know we could
be if we could just

00:08:45.680 --> 00:08:48.950 align:middle line:84%
remove that block of fear that
stops us being that person.

00:08:48.950 --> 00:08:50.902 align:middle line:84%
That's how we can really
retrain our brains

00:08:50.902 --> 00:08:51.860 align:middle line:90%
through lucid dreaming.

00:08:51.860 --> 00:08:53.030 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: That's interesting.

00:08:53.030 --> 00:08:54.613 align:middle line:84%
Because as you're
speaking about that,

00:08:54.613 --> 00:08:57.980 align:middle line:84%
I'm thinking about another
person I interviewed recently.

00:08:57.980 --> 00:09:01.190 align:middle line:84%
Which went back to a book
that was written in 1960,

00:09:01.190 --> 00:09:03.776 align:middle line:84%
I believe, called
Psycho-Cybernetics.

00:09:03.776 --> 00:09:05.150 align:middle line:84%
And there were
others at the time

00:09:05.150 --> 00:09:09.380 align:middle line:84%
too that he referenced
that did a lot of studies

00:09:09.380 --> 00:09:13.400 align:middle line:84%
that had to do with people doing
this but during waking time.

00:09:13.400 --> 00:09:19.820 align:middle line:84%
Simply in a relaxed state,
daydreaming a repeated reality

00:09:19.820 --> 00:09:22.130 align:middle line:84%
over the course of
21 days, or 30 days,

00:09:22.130 --> 00:09:25.550 align:middle line:84%
depending on whoever
the clinical group was.

00:09:25.550 --> 00:09:27.950 align:middle line:84%
And finding these
very similar results.

00:09:27.950 --> 00:09:31.160 align:middle line:84%
But it was a daydreaming
kind of experience.

00:09:31.160 --> 00:09:33.860 align:middle line:84%
Now, would you say
qualitatively there

00:09:33.860 --> 00:09:37.520 align:middle line:84%
would be any maybe difference
between the daydreaming

00:09:37.520 --> 00:09:39.680 align:middle line:84%
and the lucid dreaming
version of that?

00:09:39.680 --> 00:09:41.540 align:middle line:84%
>>MORLEY: Very
interesting question.

00:09:41.540 --> 00:09:44.420 align:middle line:84%
The control condition for some
of those studies with athletes

00:09:44.420 --> 00:09:47.209 align:middle line:84%
and lucid dreaming was daytime
visualized preparation.

00:09:47.209 --> 00:09:48.125 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Interesting.

00:09:48.125 --> 00:09:51.830 align:middle line:84%
>>MORLEY: What they found was,
simply because the lucid dream

00:09:51.830 --> 00:09:55.245 align:middle line:84%
is the most 100% visualization
a human being will ever

00:09:55.245 --> 00:09:56.045 align:middle line:90%
experience--

00:09:56.045 --> 00:09:57.461 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Yeah,
it's full-sensory.

00:09:57.461 --> 00:09:58.670 align:middle line:90%
>>MORLEY: Exactly.

00:09:58.670 --> 00:10:00.470 align:middle line:84%
That visualized
training techniques

00:10:00.470 --> 00:10:03.359 align:middle line:84%
work with far greater
efficacy in the lucid dream

00:10:03.359 --> 00:10:04.400 align:middle line:90%
than in the waking state.

00:10:04.400 --> 00:10:06.795 align:middle line:84%
So yes, like visualized
training max.

00:10:06.795 --> 00:10:12.210 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So we can go into
the same field of intention.

00:10:12.210 --> 00:10:16.340 align:middle line:84%
But it's set into motion with
our intention in dream time.

00:10:16.340 --> 00:10:18.500 align:middle line:84%
Rather than doing
our affirmations,

00:10:18.500 --> 00:10:20.840 align:middle line:84%
our mantras, our visualization
during the daytime.

00:10:20.840 --> 00:10:22.070 align:middle line:90%
Not that that hurts anything.

00:10:22.070 --> 00:10:22.880 align:middle line:90%
It doesn't.

00:10:22.880 --> 00:10:26.319 align:middle line:84%
But you're saying it's more
efficacious if we actually

00:10:26.319 --> 00:10:28.610 align:middle line:84%
set it into motion intentionally
before we go to sleep?

00:10:28.610 --> 00:10:30.470 align:middle line:84%
>>MORLEY: Yes-- I
think we still have

00:10:30.470 --> 00:10:31.770 align:middle line:90%
to do the work in the daytime.

00:10:31.770 --> 00:10:34.010 align:middle line:84%
Just like those athletes
who are practicing squats

00:10:34.010 --> 00:10:35.630 align:middle line:84%
in the lucid dream
only got better

00:10:35.630 --> 00:10:38.310 align:middle line:84%
at squats when they practiced
them in the waking state,

00:10:38.310 --> 00:10:40.670 align:middle line:84%
so too our meditation,
our compassion,

00:10:40.670 --> 00:10:43.340 align:middle line:84%
our mantra recitation
in the lucid dreams

00:10:43.340 --> 00:10:44.810 align:middle line:90%
is incredibly powerful.

00:10:44.810 --> 00:10:46.460 align:middle line:84%
From the Buddhist
tradition, it said

00:10:46.460 --> 00:10:49.100 align:middle line:84%
you have between seven
and nine times the power

00:10:49.100 --> 00:10:51.680 align:middle line:84%
of consciousness when you
engage a spiritual practice

00:10:51.680 --> 00:10:54.770 align:middle line:84%
in the lucid dream compared
to the waking state.

00:10:54.770 --> 00:10:57.590 align:middle line:84%
But although we are asleep
for 1/3 of our life--

00:10:57.590 --> 00:11:00.360 align:middle line:84%
so let's make use of that 1/3
to do our spiritual practice--

00:11:00.360 --> 00:11:01.770 align:middle line:90%
we're awake for 2/3.

00:11:01.770 --> 00:11:03.670 align:middle line:84%
It does no good just
doing the lucid dreaming

00:11:03.670 --> 00:11:05.254 align:middle line:84%
and forgetting about
the waking state.

00:11:05.254 --> 00:11:06.878 align:middle line:84%
We've got to keep
them both in balance.

00:11:06.878 --> 00:11:08.360 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Absolutely--
OK, here's

00:11:08.360 --> 00:11:10.490 align:middle line:84%
something that
some people wonder

00:11:10.490 --> 00:11:11.960 align:middle line:90%
what the difference might be.

00:11:11.960 --> 00:11:14.390 align:middle line:84%
So if they say we
leave the body--

00:11:14.390 --> 00:11:16.880 align:middle line:84%
some aspect of ourselves
leaves the body

00:11:16.880 --> 00:11:20.180 align:middle line:84%
but still remains connected
through this little silvery

00:11:20.180 --> 00:11:23.700 align:middle line:90%
cord as we sleep at night--

00:11:23.700 --> 00:11:27.020 align:middle line:84%
what's happening when we,
say, astral travel or have

00:11:27.020 --> 00:11:30.320 align:middle line:84%
an out-of-body experience
in comparison to dream time?

00:11:30.320 --> 00:11:32.450 align:middle line:84%
Because for a lot
of people it would

00:11:32.450 --> 00:11:33.800 align:middle line:90%
seem a very similar experience.

00:11:33.800 --> 00:11:36.175 align:middle line:84%
>>MORLEY: Yeah, so my wife's
actually the expert on this.

00:11:36.175 --> 00:11:38.360 align:middle line:84%
She teaches workshops on
out-of-body experience.

00:11:38.360 --> 00:11:40.880 align:middle line:84%
And I do the lucid
dreaming stuff.

00:11:40.880 --> 00:11:43.610 align:middle line:84%
We would both agree that
a lucid dream is actually

00:11:43.610 --> 00:11:45.380 align:middle line:90%
the mind flipped inwardly.

00:11:45.380 --> 00:11:48.500 align:middle line:84%
So the lucid dream is
absolutely an in-body, in-brain

00:11:48.500 --> 00:11:49.610 align:middle line:90%
experience.

00:11:49.610 --> 00:11:53.110 align:middle line:84%
You are exploring the totality
of your own psychology

00:11:53.110 --> 00:11:54.710 align:middle line:90%
in personified form.

00:11:54.710 --> 00:11:56.600 align:middle line:84%
So if you meet your
dad in a lucid dream,

00:11:56.600 --> 00:11:57.820 align:middle line:90%
it's not really your dad.

00:11:57.820 --> 00:11:59.300 align:middle line:90%
It might have a little aspect.

00:11:59.300 --> 00:12:02.630 align:middle line:84%
It is your psychological
projection of your relationship

00:12:02.630 --> 00:12:04.280 align:middle line:90%
with the father archetype.

00:12:04.280 --> 00:12:05.570 align:middle line:90%
So everything's internal.

00:12:05.570 --> 00:12:07.460 align:middle line:84%
However, an
out-of-body experience

00:12:07.460 --> 00:12:08.990 align:middle line:90%
is pretty much the opposite.

00:12:08.990 --> 00:12:11.510 align:middle line:84%
In a verified
out-of-body experience,

00:12:11.510 --> 00:12:13.700 align:middle line:84%
an aspect of your
consciousness or your--

00:12:13.700 --> 00:12:16.400 align:middle line:84%
to use a Buddhist
term-- mindstream

00:12:16.400 --> 00:12:19.850 align:middle line:84%
is dislocating from the
gross corporeal form,

00:12:19.850 --> 00:12:21.050 align:middle line:90%
your physical body.

00:12:21.050 --> 00:12:22.910 align:middle line:84%
And experiencing
either an energy

00:12:22.910 --> 00:12:26.030 align:middle line:84%
duplicate of waking
reality or, in many cases,

00:12:26.030 --> 00:12:28.010 align:middle line:90%
waking reality itself.

00:12:28.010 --> 00:12:29.670 align:middle line:90%
So they are different.

00:12:29.670 --> 00:12:33.170 align:middle line:84%
A lot of people get confused
between lucid dreams and OBEs.

00:12:33.170 --> 00:12:36.140 align:middle line:84%
But in fact, a
full-on OBE, for one,

00:12:36.140 --> 00:12:37.490 align:middle line:90%
you don't have to be asleep.

00:12:37.490 --> 00:12:40.151 align:middle line:84%
You can do it in the hypnogogic
state as you're falling asleep.

00:12:40.151 --> 00:12:41.900 align:middle line:84%
And you can do it in
the meditation state.

00:12:41.900 --> 00:12:43.580 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Right,
and in dream time,

00:12:43.580 --> 00:12:50.270 align:middle line:84%
you're virtually always
safe in that that mechanism

00:12:50.270 --> 00:12:53.280 align:middle line:84%
automatically knows what
to do and how to do it.

00:12:53.280 --> 00:12:55.322 align:middle line:84%
Where out of body
and astral travel,

00:12:55.322 --> 00:12:56.780 align:middle line:84%
you better be
skilled and know what

00:12:56.780 --> 00:12:57.988 align:middle line:90%
you're getting yourself into.

00:12:57.988 --> 00:13:01.046 align:middle line:84%
>>MORLEY: Brilliant
point-- in the lucid dream,

00:13:01.046 --> 00:13:03.170 align:middle line:84%
you are dealing with your
own internal environment.

00:13:03.170 --> 00:13:04.299 align:middle line:90%
It's your own psychology.

00:13:04.299 --> 00:13:06.590 align:middle line:84%
Now, I don't know about you,
but my internal psychology

00:13:06.590 --> 00:13:08.010 align:middle line:90%
is still pretty scary.

00:13:08.010 --> 00:13:10.310 align:middle line:84%
So you can still go to some
deep, dark places and wake

00:13:10.310 --> 00:13:11.420 align:middle line:90%
up with a bit of a fright.

00:13:11.420 --> 00:13:13.670 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: I was going to bring
the question up in a minute.

00:13:13.670 --> 00:13:14.470 align:middle line:90%
Go ahead.

00:13:14.470 --> 00:13:16.460 align:middle line:84%
>>MORLEY: But it's
your shadow concept.

00:13:16.460 --> 00:13:17.900 align:middle line:90%
It's your psychology.

00:13:17.900 --> 00:13:22.170 align:middle line:84%
However, when you have an OBE,
you ain't in Kansas anymore.

00:13:22.170 --> 00:13:22.970 align:middle line:90%
You're out there.

00:13:22.970 --> 00:13:26.210 align:middle line:84%
So in the same way you can
walk down a street in London

00:13:26.210 --> 00:13:27.650 align:middle line:90%
1,000 times.

00:13:27.650 --> 00:13:30.950 align:middle line:84%
And 999 times you'll
be safe, but maybe one

00:13:30.950 --> 00:13:33.020 align:middle line:84%
in 1,000 times someone
steals your phone.

00:13:33.020 --> 00:13:36.470 align:middle line:84%
Someone tries to nick your
wallet, as we say in London.

00:13:36.470 --> 00:13:39.140 align:middle line:84%
Who knows-- maybe it's the
same with the OBE world.

00:13:39.140 --> 00:13:41.180 align:middle line:84%
So I think, if we are
going out, we just

00:13:41.180 --> 00:13:43.340 align:middle line:84%
need to be aware that
we are in a place that

00:13:43.340 --> 00:13:44.780 align:middle line:90%
may be shared with others.

00:13:44.780 --> 00:13:48.200 align:middle line:84%
So I would suggest anyone who is
doing out-of-body work to do it

00:13:48.200 --> 00:13:49.160 align:middle line:90%
from a foundation.

00:13:49.160 --> 00:13:51.020 align:middle line:84%
Or at least learn
from someone with

00:13:51.020 --> 00:13:53.270 align:middle line:90%
a lineage-based foundation.

00:13:53.270 --> 00:13:56.240 align:middle line:84%
Someone who is linked
to something that's been

00:13:56.240 --> 00:13:57.860 align:middle line:90%
going longer than they have.

00:13:57.860 --> 00:13:59.790 align:middle line:84%
Something that is
a power source.

00:13:59.790 --> 00:14:01.910 align:middle line:84%
Whether it's a spiritual
lineage, or the lineage

00:14:01.910 --> 00:14:04.770 align:middle line:84%
of a certain teacher, or
even the lineage of a plant

00:14:04.770 --> 00:14:05.570 align:middle line:90%
medicine.

00:14:05.570 --> 00:14:08.150 align:middle line:84%
That gives you a safety net
with which you can go out

00:14:08.150 --> 00:14:10.610 align:middle line:90%
of body with a sense of safety.

00:14:10.610 --> 00:14:12.920 align:middle line:84%
Whereas, I think if you
just kind of pick up a book

00:14:12.920 --> 00:14:16.100 align:middle line:84%
and you're just kind of
by yourself out there,

00:14:16.100 --> 00:14:17.600 align:middle line:84%
I don't know how
confident I'd feel.

00:14:17.600 --> 00:14:20.400 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Well I can attest to
that because I'm an explorer.

00:14:20.400 --> 00:14:21.980 align:middle line:90%
Or I like to adventure.

00:14:21.980 --> 00:14:26.130 align:middle line:84%
And a lot of times, I'll
just do it on the fly.

00:14:26.130 --> 00:14:30.110 align:middle line:84%
Which gets you into some
pretty interesting situations.

00:14:30.110 --> 00:14:34.400 align:middle line:84%
And one time, I did end up
in a very dicey situation

00:14:34.400 --> 00:14:37.310 align:middle line:90%
out-of-body into another realm.

00:14:37.310 --> 00:14:39.860 align:middle line:84%
It was a place I
hadn't seen before.

00:14:39.860 --> 00:14:41.600 align:middle line:84%
Kind of everything
was gray, kind

00:14:41.600 --> 00:14:43.930 align:middle line:90%
of gray and pale blue shades.

00:14:43.930 --> 00:14:46.400 align:middle line:90%
And a terrible lurking energy.

00:14:46.400 --> 00:14:48.320 align:middle line:90%
And I couldn't find my way out.

00:14:48.320 --> 00:14:50.750 align:middle line:90%
And actually, my dog--

00:14:50.750 --> 00:14:54.620 align:middle line:84%
who was always silent during
these types of meditations--

00:14:54.620 --> 00:14:59.030 align:middle line:84%
for the first time and only time
jumped up and barked and jumped

00:14:59.030 --> 00:15:00.380 align:middle line:90%
on my meditation partner.

00:15:00.380 --> 00:15:01.730 align:middle line:90%
We were there at the same time.

00:15:01.730 --> 00:15:03.440 align:middle line:90%
We would travel together.

00:15:03.440 --> 00:15:04.580 align:middle line:90%
And jumped on her.

00:15:04.580 --> 00:15:05.870 align:middle line:90%
She screamed.

00:15:05.870 --> 00:15:06.920 align:middle line:90%
It snapped me back.

00:15:06.920 --> 00:15:08.640 align:middle line:90%
But I was damaged.

00:15:08.640 --> 00:15:09.670 align:middle line:90%
I was actually damaged.

00:15:09.670 --> 00:15:11.630 align:middle line:84%
>>MORLEY: So the dog
sensed the danger, wow.

00:15:11.630 --> 00:15:13.520 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: The dog
sensed the danger.

00:15:13.520 --> 00:15:15.620 align:middle line:84%
And then, I had a
dream a couple nights

00:15:15.620 --> 00:15:18.350 align:middle line:84%
later that this whole side
of my aura was blown out

00:15:18.350 --> 00:15:21.890 align:middle line:84%
and black and a hole,
basically, leaking.

00:15:21.890 --> 00:15:27.137 align:middle line:84%
And that I would be dead within
18 months if it wasn't fixed.

00:15:27.137 --> 00:15:28.970 align:middle line:84%
And so I won't tell you
what I went through.

00:15:28.970 --> 00:15:30.410 align:middle line:90%
But I went through some things.

00:15:30.410 --> 00:15:32.090 align:middle line:84%
They instantly saw
what was going on.

00:15:32.090 --> 00:15:34.220 align:middle line:90%
It was all repaired.

00:15:34.220 --> 00:15:35.150 align:middle line:90%
But it was scary.

00:15:35.150 --> 00:15:37.460 align:middle line:84%
What I did do though was,
I thought-- well, come on,

00:15:37.460 --> 00:15:39.260 align:middle line:90%
not really.

00:15:39.260 --> 00:15:40.760 align:middle line:84%
But I was scared
enough by the dream

00:15:40.760 --> 00:15:42.939 align:middle line:84%
I went to one of those
aura photography machines.

00:15:42.939 --> 00:15:45.230 align:middle line:84%
Because someone said-- oh,
there's a new one in Sedona.

00:15:45.230 --> 00:15:46.313 align:middle line:90%
It's actually really good.

00:15:46.313 --> 00:15:48.271 align:middle line:10%
And I thought-- yeah, right.

00:15:48.271 --> 00:15:49.520 align:middle line:90%
Usually, they're pretty basic.

00:15:49.520 --> 00:15:51.470 align:middle line:90%
It showed that exact thing.

00:15:51.470 --> 00:15:54.500 align:middle line:84%
Right in that place, the whole
thing was black and blown out.

00:15:54.500 --> 00:15:57.890 align:middle line:10%
So I took it seriously, got
some help, and got fixed up.

00:15:57.890 --> 00:16:00.200 align:middle line:10%
But I'm just bringing
it up because I just

00:16:00.200 --> 00:16:03.960 align:middle line:10%
went without any understanding
of what I was doing.

00:16:03.960 --> 00:16:05.630 align:middle line:90%
And it's not a good place to go.

00:16:05.630 --> 00:16:06.950 align:middle line:90%
>>MORLEY: It's a great example.

00:16:06.950 --> 00:16:10.610 align:middle line:84%
It's-- god, it makes me feel
so lucky actually to be part

00:16:10.610 --> 00:16:12.650 align:middle line:90%
of the lineage.

00:16:12.650 --> 00:16:13.690 align:middle line:10%
The one time--

00:16:13.690 --> 00:16:17.390 align:middle line:10%
I've had quite a few dozen OBEs.

00:16:17.390 --> 00:16:20.090 align:middle line:84%
Hundreds of lucid dreams but
only a few dozen out-of-body

00:16:20.090 --> 00:16:20.910 align:middle line:90%
experiences.

00:16:20.910 --> 00:16:23.240 align:middle line:84%
And just on one
occasion, I went out.

00:16:23.240 --> 00:16:25.560 align:middle line:84%
And I was actually
feeling very high-energy.

00:16:25.560 --> 00:16:28.670 align:middle line:84%
But I think maybe that's
kind of like you then

00:16:28.670 --> 00:16:30.160 align:middle line:90%
become a beacon for energy.

00:16:30.160 --> 00:16:32.910 align:middle line:84%
And just once, this thing
kind of-- felt like a leech--

00:16:32.910 --> 00:16:35.630 align:middle line:84%
this energy form just
kind of latched onto me.

00:16:35.630 --> 00:16:37.250 align:middle line:90%
And I started getting tired.

00:16:37.250 --> 00:16:39.920 align:middle line:84%
And I was like-- oh, whoa,
this has never happened.

00:16:39.920 --> 00:16:41.370 align:middle line:90%
This is sucking my energy.

00:16:41.370 --> 00:16:42.260 align:middle line:90%
And I just--

00:16:42.260 --> 00:16:45.560 align:middle line:84%
I didn't even have a chance
to say my Lama's name.

00:16:45.560 --> 00:16:46.670 align:middle line:90%
But I just thought--

00:16:46.670 --> 00:16:47.810 align:middle line:90%
Lama Yeshe Rinpoche.

00:16:47.810 --> 00:16:49.500 align:middle line:90%
I just thought of Buddha.

00:16:49.500 --> 00:16:51.660 align:middle line:84%
And it wasn't like
this thing let go.

00:16:51.660 --> 00:16:53.990 align:middle line:84%
It was like the thing
had never latched on.

00:16:53.990 --> 00:16:56.080 align:middle line:84%
And I realized-- wow,
in that space, if you--

00:16:56.080 --> 00:16:57.955 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: You shifted
your frequencies, yeah.

00:16:57.955 --> 00:16:59.538 align:middle line:84%
>>MORLEY: Yeah, and
if you can connect

00:16:59.538 --> 00:17:01.840 align:middle line:84%
to a powerful
frequency, actually you

00:17:01.840 --> 00:17:03.950 align:middle line:90%
are totally safe out there.

00:17:03.950 --> 00:17:08.780 align:middle line:84%
And there is no harm if we
can step into that frequency.

00:17:08.780 --> 00:17:11.569 align:middle line:84%
But if we are unaware of
that before we go out,

00:17:11.569 --> 00:17:14.008 align:middle line:90%
it can have consequences.

00:17:14.008 --> 00:17:16.760 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Well, let's also talk
about when you encounter beings

00:17:16.760 --> 00:17:18.770 align:middle line:90%
and you think you're dreaming.

00:17:18.770 --> 00:17:20.334 align:middle line:84%
Or you may know
you're not dreaming,

00:17:20.334 --> 00:17:22.250 align:middle line:84%
and you're actually
passing through that place

00:17:22.250 --> 00:17:24.950 align:middle line:84%
just before you enter
back into this reality.

00:17:24.950 --> 00:17:27.650 align:middle line:84%
That passes through where a
lot of disincarnate entities

00:17:27.650 --> 00:17:29.270 align:middle line:90%
are and exist.

00:17:29.270 --> 00:17:33.230 align:middle line:84%
And one of the things I
have learned to understand

00:17:33.230 --> 00:17:36.470 align:middle line:84%
is, you don't want to entangle
yourself and go touching beings

00:17:36.470 --> 00:17:39.410 align:middle line:84%
or let them touch
you in this place

00:17:39.410 --> 00:17:44.060 align:middle line:84%
upon entering back into the body
and into this reality again.

00:17:44.060 --> 00:17:45.650 align:middle line:84%
Have you had any
experience with that?

00:17:45.650 --> 00:17:46.910 align:middle line:90%
>>MORLEY: It's interesting.

00:17:46.910 --> 00:17:48.800 align:middle line:84%
The Buddhist view,
right, is that this

00:17:48.800 --> 00:17:50.300 align:middle line:90%
is a compassionate universe.

00:17:50.300 --> 00:17:52.370 align:middle line:90%
There is no dark energy.

00:17:52.370 --> 00:17:53.695 align:middle line:90%
There's no evil.

00:17:53.695 --> 00:17:55.070 align:middle line:84%
This is a
compassionate universe.

00:17:55.070 --> 00:17:56.980 align:middle line:84%
And you are a fully
enlightened Buddha.

00:17:56.980 --> 00:18:00.200 align:middle line:84%
You just haven't fully
woken up to that yet.

00:18:00.200 --> 00:18:01.819 align:middle line:84%
So from that case,
no, there's nothing

00:18:01.819 --> 00:18:03.110 align:middle line:90%
to be scared of when we go out.

00:18:03.110 --> 00:18:04.725 align:middle line:84%
But it's-- it's
almost to say, well,

00:18:04.725 --> 00:18:06.600 align:middle line:84%
it's all very good for
Buddhists to say that.

00:18:06.600 --> 00:18:09.050 align:middle line:84%
That's because Buddhists spend
the whole time practicing

00:18:09.050 --> 00:18:09.883 align:middle line:90%
love and compassion.

00:18:09.883 --> 00:18:12.260 align:middle line:84%
So I think if you are
a practitioner of love

00:18:12.260 --> 00:18:14.820 align:middle line:84%
and compassion, the
universe reflects that.

00:18:14.820 --> 00:18:17.330 align:middle line:84%
So yes, it becomes a
compassionate universe.

00:18:17.330 --> 00:18:19.270 align:middle line:84%
And there is
nothing to harm you.

00:18:19.270 --> 00:18:21.436 align:middle line:84%
However, how many
billions of people

00:18:21.436 --> 00:18:23.060 align:middle line:84%
are there in the
world today who aren't

00:18:23.060 --> 00:18:25.220 align:middle line:84%
coming from a point of
love and compassion?

00:18:25.220 --> 00:18:28.359 align:middle line:84%
And so the universe will reflect
the duality of both good and--

00:18:28.359 --> 00:18:29.900 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Yes,
especially when you're

00:18:29.900 --> 00:18:32.240 align:middle line:84%
tripping through all these
different dimensions coming

00:18:32.240 --> 00:18:33.416 align:middle line:90%
back into your body.

00:18:33.416 --> 00:18:35.540 align:middle line:84%
You just don't know if
you're going to kind of pass

00:18:35.540 --> 00:18:38.180 align:middle line:84%
through a little more slowly at
certain dimensions sometimes.

00:18:38.180 --> 00:18:39.950 align:middle line:84%
>>MORLEY: Yeah, so the
Buddhist view is-- no,

00:18:39.950 --> 00:18:40.400 align:middle line:90%
you're totally safe.

00:18:40.400 --> 00:18:41.746 align:middle line:90%
It's a compassionate universe.

00:18:41.746 --> 00:18:43.370 align:middle line:84%
But I think we're
totally safe and this

00:18:43.370 --> 00:18:45.050 align:middle line:84%
is a compassionate
universe if we are

00:18:45.050 --> 00:18:46.280 align:middle line:90%
coming from a point of love.

00:18:46.280 --> 00:18:49.160 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Right, and still
maybe just to be wise

00:18:49.160 --> 00:18:51.470 align:middle line:84%
and not entangle
when you're there.

00:18:51.470 --> 00:18:52.410 align:middle line:90%
That's their world.

00:18:52.410 --> 00:18:53.540 align:middle line:90%
It's not your world.

00:18:53.540 --> 00:18:55.190 align:middle line:90%
And send love.

00:18:55.190 --> 00:18:57.890 align:middle line:84%
I mean, that's happened a couple
times where I tripped through

00:18:57.890 --> 00:19:00.470 align:middle line:84%
and realized I'm in
that in-between place.

00:19:00.470 --> 00:19:02.750 align:middle line:84%
And just sending love to
the other person that's

00:19:02.750 --> 00:19:06.080 align:middle line:84%
reaching out to be recognized or
touched is more than adequate.

00:19:06.080 --> 00:19:08.270 align:middle line:84%
>>MORLEY: Exactly--
the same rules apply

00:19:08.270 --> 00:19:10.010 align:middle line:90%
within the lucid dream state.

00:19:10.010 --> 00:19:12.620 align:middle line:84%
A lot of people, when they have
their first few lucid dreams,

00:19:12.620 --> 00:19:14.150 align:middle line:90%
they like to run around.

00:19:14.150 --> 00:19:16.250 align:middle line:84%
They know-- oh, everything
in here is me, right.

00:19:16.250 --> 00:19:18.110 align:middle line:84%
So they go after dream
characters and say--

00:19:18.110 --> 00:19:19.530 align:middle line:90%
hey, you're just a dream.

00:19:19.530 --> 00:19:22.060 align:middle line:84%
And the dream character kind
of looks a bit upset and goes--

00:19:22.060 --> 00:19:22.640 align:middle line:90%
no, I'm not.

00:19:22.640 --> 00:19:22.970 align:middle line:90%
I'm real.

00:19:22.970 --> 00:19:24.560 align:middle line:84%
And they-- no, no,
I'm lucid dreaming.

00:19:24.560 --> 00:19:26.490 align:middle line:90%
You don't even exist.

00:19:26.490 --> 00:19:28.400 align:middle line:84%
And I think-- what's
the point of that?

00:19:28.400 --> 00:19:32.450 align:middle line:84%
What is to be gained from this
kind of power play ego trip

00:19:32.450 --> 00:19:34.730 align:middle line:84%
by telling our dream
characters they don't exist?

00:19:34.730 --> 00:19:36.470 align:middle line:90%
Now, perhaps they don't exist.

00:19:36.470 --> 00:19:39.080 align:middle line:84%
But in their reality
of your dream, they do.

00:19:39.080 --> 00:19:41.592 align:middle line:84%
So I don't think it's anything
to be gained by doing that.

00:19:41.592 --> 00:19:42.800 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: No, I don't either.

00:19:42.800 --> 00:19:44.758 align:middle line:84%
>>MORLEY: So what I say
is-- once you're lucid,

00:19:44.758 --> 00:19:47.200 align:middle line:84%
run around your lucid
dream hugging everything.

00:19:47.200 --> 00:19:48.830 align:middle line:90%
Hug the people.

00:19:48.830 --> 00:19:50.370 align:middle line:90%
Definitely hug the scary people.

00:19:50.370 --> 00:19:51.170 align:middle line:90%
Hug the table.

00:19:51.170 --> 00:19:52.140 align:middle line:90%
Hug the trees.

00:19:52.140 --> 00:19:54.290 align:middle line:84%
If everything in the
lucid dream is us,

00:19:54.290 --> 00:19:55.905 align:middle line:90%
then show everything love.

00:19:55.905 --> 00:19:57.530 align:middle line:84%
And if you run around
your lucid dreams

00:19:57.530 --> 00:19:59.630 align:middle line:84%
hugging everything,
the next day, of course

00:19:59.630 --> 00:20:00.800 align:middle line:90%
you feel amazing.

00:20:00.800 --> 00:20:03.730 align:middle line:84%
Because you've had 1,000
internal psychological hugs.

00:20:03.730 --> 00:20:06.080 align:middle line:84%
And so too are you
rewiring the brain

00:20:06.080 --> 00:20:07.820 align:middle line:90%
to be more likely to hug life.

00:20:07.820 --> 00:20:11.270 align:middle line:84%
Maybe not literally hugging the
people on the tube underground.

00:20:11.270 --> 00:20:13.520 align:middle line:84%
But you could hug them
with your intention.

00:20:13.520 --> 00:20:15.507 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Yes, you
wouldn't want to try that.

00:20:15.507 --> 00:20:18.090 align:middle line:84%
>>MORLEY: Why don't you try it
in London and see what happens?

00:20:18.090 --> 00:20:20.330 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Yeah, see
what happens-- exactly.

00:20:20.330 --> 00:20:21.830 align:middle line:84%
OK, so this is
something I've always

00:20:21.830 --> 00:20:24.350 align:middle line:84%
been curious about when I've
interviewed people and also

00:20:24.350 --> 00:20:28.320 align:middle line:84%
just in daily life talking
with people about dreams.

00:20:28.320 --> 00:20:30.180 align:middle line:84%
I don't think this
is a prejudice.

00:20:30.180 --> 00:20:32.960 align:middle line:84%
It's my observation
that men seem

00:20:32.960 --> 00:20:37.520 align:middle line:84%
to be much more prone
toward the nightmare scape

00:20:37.520 --> 00:20:40.220 align:middle line:90%
and violent dreams than women.

00:20:40.220 --> 00:20:43.380 align:middle line:84%
And my guess is-- this
is my own point of view.

00:20:43.380 --> 00:20:45.170 align:middle line:90%
So I'm labeling it as such.

00:20:45.170 --> 00:20:49.820 align:middle line:84%
That if one has been incarnating
dominantly male, for example--

00:20:49.820 --> 00:20:52.430 align:middle line:84%
or dominantly female--
you carry a set

00:20:52.430 --> 00:20:53.900 align:middle line:90%
of historical experiences.

00:20:53.900 --> 00:20:56.450 align:middle line:84%
And if you've been
incarnating dominantly male,

00:20:56.450 --> 00:20:59.810 align:middle line:84%
you've been exposed probably
to a lot of warfare, violence,

00:20:59.810 --> 00:21:01.250 align:middle line:90%
and that sort of thing.

00:21:01.250 --> 00:21:04.800 align:middle line:84%
And so that's stuck there in
your being, in your matrix,

00:21:04.800 --> 00:21:05.600 align:middle line:90%
right.

00:21:05.600 --> 00:21:09.072 align:middle line:84%
And you're having to play
it out in dream time more.

00:21:09.072 --> 00:21:10.820 align:middle line:84%
>>MORLEY: It's a very
interesting theory.

00:21:10.820 --> 00:21:12.736 align:middle line:84%
And because it's the
first time I've heard it,

00:21:12.736 --> 00:21:14.130 align:middle line:84%
I don't want to
agree or disagree

00:21:14.130 --> 00:21:16.340 align:middle line:84%
until I've had time
to mull it over.

00:21:16.340 --> 00:21:17.984 align:middle line:90%
But it sounds very interesting.

00:21:17.984 --> 00:21:19.400 align:middle line:84%
How you were
speaking, what it did

00:21:19.400 --> 00:21:22.520 align:middle line:84%
make me think of though
was the possibility

00:21:22.520 --> 00:21:25.850 align:middle line:84%
of a toxic masculinity
that a lot of men

00:21:25.850 --> 00:21:29.270 align:middle line:84%
nowadays are working with
being expressed in the dream

00:21:29.270 --> 00:21:33.680 align:middle line:84%
state in the form of nightmares,
or at least in a conflict.

00:21:33.680 --> 00:21:37.370 align:middle line:84%
I'm sure that goes for
people in female sex too

00:21:37.370 --> 00:21:39.170 align:middle line:90%
and people of fluid gender.

00:21:39.170 --> 00:21:43.220 align:middle line:84%
But it is interesting to look
at the traits of dreaming

00:21:43.220 --> 00:21:45.590 align:middle line:84%
that occur between
the genders, even

00:21:45.590 --> 00:21:48.940 align:middle line:84%
between the nationalities,
and even between the ages.

00:21:48.940 --> 00:21:52.160 align:middle line:84%
And I've spent the last 10 years
traveling 21 countries around

00:21:52.160 --> 00:21:54.170 align:middle line:84%
the world-- everywhere
from Zimbabwe to Mexico--

00:21:54.170 --> 00:21:55.280 align:middle line:90%
teaching lucid dreaming.

00:21:55.280 --> 00:21:57.020 align:middle line:90%
And I love to see--

00:21:57.020 --> 00:21:59.830 align:middle line:84%
what were the dreams
of a Zimbabwean witch

00:21:59.830 --> 00:22:03.610 align:middle line:84%
doctor compared to a
Mexican psychotherapist?

00:22:03.610 --> 00:22:06.280 align:middle line:84%
And actually, what I've seen
is, they're not so different.

00:22:06.280 --> 00:22:09.590 align:middle line:84%
That actually, the
presentation, the coloring,

00:22:09.590 --> 00:22:11.900 align:middle line:84%
the kind of brush
strokes may be different.

00:22:11.900 --> 00:22:14.780 align:middle line:84%
But the overall canvas of
what people dream about,

00:22:14.780 --> 00:22:17.600 align:middle line:84%
the concerns they have,
the emotional issues that

00:22:17.600 --> 00:22:21.375 align:middle line:84%
arise within the dream is kind
of universal and beyond sex

00:22:21.375 --> 00:22:22.175 align:middle line:90%
and gender.

00:22:22.175 --> 00:22:23.950 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Interesting--
yeah, I was just

00:22:23.950 --> 00:22:24.950 align:middle line:90%
making that observation.

00:22:24.950 --> 00:22:26.990 align:middle line:84%
Because I always hear about
these violent nightmares

00:22:26.990 --> 00:22:27.560 align:middle line:90%
with men.

00:22:27.560 --> 00:22:29.360 align:middle line:84%
But I don't hear about
that from the women.

00:22:29.360 --> 00:22:31.340 align:middle line:90%
Women, a nightmare is--

00:22:31.340 --> 00:22:32.650 align:middle line:90%
my boyfriend left me.

00:22:32.650 --> 00:22:35.212 align:middle line:84%
It's a different kind
of nightmare, right.

00:22:35.212 --> 00:22:36.440 align:middle line:90%
>>MORLEY: Still pretty scary.

00:22:36.440 --> 00:22:39.930 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Scary, but oftentimes
relational, abandonment.

00:22:39.930 --> 00:22:41.720 align:middle line:84%
It seems like with
women, abandonment

00:22:41.720 --> 00:22:44.150 align:middle line:90%
is a really big one.

00:22:44.150 --> 00:22:45.740 align:middle line:84%
Whereas with men,
it's actually having

00:22:45.740 --> 00:22:47.867 align:middle line:90%
to fight off the bogeyman.

00:22:47.867 --> 00:22:49.700 align:middle line:84%
>>MORLEY: Well, there's
interesting theories

00:22:49.700 --> 00:22:53.590 align:middle line:84%
if you look at the neurological
basis of why we dream.

00:22:53.590 --> 00:22:55.940 align:middle line:84%
So modern day neuroscience
doesn't acknowledge

00:22:55.940 --> 00:22:58.990 align:middle line:84%
an unconscious in the
same way as Carl Jung

00:22:58.990 --> 00:23:00.830 align:middle line:90%
would describe the unconscious.

00:23:00.830 --> 00:23:03.590 align:middle line:84%
But it acknowledges
unconscious processes.

00:23:03.590 --> 00:23:09.380 align:middle line:84%
And modern day research believes
that the reason we dream,

00:23:09.380 --> 00:23:11.870 align:middle line:84%
and specifically the
reason we have nightmares,

00:23:11.870 --> 00:23:13.520 align:middle line:84%
is perhaps the
reason that's got us

00:23:13.520 --> 00:23:15.470 align:middle line:90%
the top predator on the planet.

00:23:15.470 --> 00:23:17.600 align:middle line:84%
Because when we were
cave men and cave women,

00:23:17.600 --> 00:23:21.770 align:middle line:84%
if we could dream about running
from the saber tooth tiger,

00:23:21.770 --> 00:23:24.410 align:middle line:84%
the next night fighting saber
tooth tiger, the next night

00:23:24.410 --> 00:23:27.320 align:middle line:84%
hiding up a tree from
the saber tooth tiger,

00:23:27.320 --> 00:23:29.580 align:middle line:84%
next week, if we were to
encounter the saber tooth

00:23:29.580 --> 00:23:31.940 align:middle line:84%
tiger, we were more
likely to survive.

00:23:31.940 --> 00:23:35.600 align:middle line:84%
Because we had rehearsed these
scenarios within our dreams.

00:23:35.600 --> 00:23:38.360 align:middle line:84%
So sometimes, I think, when we
have dreams based on the four

00:23:38.360 --> 00:23:40.160 align:middle line:90%
Fs of the reptilian brain--

00:23:40.160 --> 00:23:43.341 align:middle line:84%
feeding, fighting, fleeing,
and the other one--

00:23:43.341 --> 00:23:44.340 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: We know what--

00:23:44.340 --> 00:23:45.349 align:middle line:90%
sex.

00:23:45.349 --> 00:23:46.890 align:middle line:84%
>>MORLEY: Yeah,
we'll use the S word,

00:23:46.890 --> 00:23:49.520 align:middle line:90%
but I won't use the F word.

00:23:49.520 --> 00:23:52.010 align:middle line:84%
That sometimes it's actually
just our brain mechanisms

00:23:52.010 --> 00:23:54.879 align:middle line:84%
kind of running through these
processes to help keep us safe.

00:23:54.879 --> 00:23:56.170 align:middle line:90%
So sometimes, people freak out.

00:23:56.170 --> 00:23:57.419 align:middle line:90%
Oh, I had a really sexy dream.

00:23:57.419 --> 00:23:58.640 align:middle line:90%
I had a really violent dream.

00:23:58.640 --> 00:24:00.080 align:middle line:84%
Is there something
wrong with me?

00:24:00.080 --> 00:24:01.550 align:middle line:84%
And actually, from a
neurological point of view,

00:24:01.550 --> 00:24:03.140 align:middle line:84%
it could be just
an updating, a bit

00:24:03.140 --> 00:24:04.620 align:middle line:90%
like when your iPhone updates.

00:24:04.620 --> 00:24:06.078 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Right,
right, overnight--

00:24:06.078 --> 00:24:08.020 align:middle line:84%
>>MORLEY: Yeah, to kind
of keep you safe so

00:24:08.020 --> 00:24:10.155 align:middle line:84%
that the next day, if
you encounter violence,

00:24:10.155 --> 00:24:11.030 align:middle line:90%
you're more prepared.

00:24:11.030 --> 00:24:13.280 align:middle line:84%
If you encounter
sexuality, you're

00:24:13.280 --> 00:24:16.400 align:middle line:84%
more prepared to
engage sexuality--

00:24:16.400 --> 00:24:18.020 align:middle line:90%
to feed yourself, to flee.

00:24:18.020 --> 00:24:21.620 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Right,
interesting-- well,

00:24:21.620 --> 00:24:25.610 align:middle line:84%
it seems like because the
scape is so broad in terms

00:24:25.610 --> 00:24:27.740 align:middle line:90%
of the type of dreams we have.

00:24:27.740 --> 00:24:30.620 align:middle line:84%
And like you say,
99% of the dreams

00:24:30.620 --> 00:24:33.145 align:middle line:84%
may be addressing
aspects of ourselves.

00:24:33.145 --> 00:24:34.270 align:middle line:90%
But there are other things.

00:24:34.270 --> 00:24:36.770 align:middle line:84%
And I want to talk about
two types of anomalies.

00:24:36.770 --> 00:24:40.275 align:middle line:84%
One of them is the 1%, where
other things are happening.

00:24:40.275 --> 00:24:42.644 align:middle line:84%
And I'm going to run a
couple of cases by you too.

00:24:42.644 --> 00:24:44.060 align:middle line:84%
But then, there's
this other thing

00:24:44.060 --> 00:24:46.060 align:middle line:90%
I notice in my own dream time--

00:24:46.060 --> 00:24:49.340 align:middle line:84%
not the traditional,
ordinary kind of dream.

00:24:49.340 --> 00:24:51.650 align:middle line:84%
But there will be
large phenomena

00:24:51.650 --> 00:24:54.470 align:middle line:84%
that are taking place,
often in the sky,

00:24:54.470 --> 00:24:57.650 align:middle line:84%
where something starts
shining and sparkling

00:24:57.650 --> 00:25:00.620 align:middle line:84%
and lining up and taking
on geometrical form.

00:25:00.620 --> 00:25:04.880 align:middle line:84%
And then, actually a couple
of weeks ago this happened.

00:25:04.880 --> 00:25:07.550 align:middle line:84%
The geometrical form, the
lines started connecting.

00:25:07.550 --> 00:25:13.070 align:middle line:84%
And it turned into a
feline type of mechanism

00:25:13.070 --> 00:25:14.810 align:middle line:90%
that jumped out of the sky.

00:25:14.810 --> 00:25:16.970 align:middle line:84%
And I was inside
a room looking out

00:25:16.970 --> 00:25:19.160 align:middle line:84%
a window watching this
thing happen, and so

00:25:19.160 --> 00:25:20.280 align:middle line:90%
were other people.

00:25:20.280 --> 00:25:23.490 align:middle line:84%
It was a phenomenon--
a cosmic phenomena--

00:25:23.490 --> 00:25:26.880 align:middle line:84%
that was happening, that was
pouncing down onto Earth,

00:25:26.880 --> 00:25:28.390 align:middle line:90%
for example.

00:25:28.390 --> 00:25:30.060 align:middle line:84%
>>MORLEY: So your
dream there sounds

00:25:30.060 --> 00:25:32.580 align:middle line:84%
like a perfect example of
what within Tibetan Buddhism

00:25:32.580 --> 00:25:34.776 align:middle line:84%
we might class as
a clarity dream.

00:25:34.776 --> 00:25:36.150 align:middle line:84%
So within Tibetan
Buddhism, there

00:25:36.150 --> 00:25:38.970 align:middle line:84%
are three main types
of dream class.

00:25:38.970 --> 00:25:41.820 align:middle line:84%
Samsaric dreams, which are
dreams based on our experience

00:25:41.820 --> 00:25:44.680 align:middle line:84%
of samsara, which is
unenlightened existence.

00:25:44.680 --> 00:25:47.390 align:middle line:84%
So until we're fully awakened,
we're experiencing samsara.

00:25:47.390 --> 00:25:51.510 align:middle line:84%
So samsaric dreams are your
everyday dreams, non-lucid.

00:25:51.510 --> 00:25:53.460 align:middle line:90%
Then, we have clarity dreams.

00:25:53.460 --> 00:25:55.980 align:middle line:84%
Within clarity dreams,
the two main aspects

00:25:55.980 --> 00:25:58.200 align:middle line:84%
are lucid dreams-- dreams
where you know that you're

00:25:58.200 --> 00:25:59.640 align:middle line:90%
dreaming as you're dreaming.

00:25:59.640 --> 00:26:02.670 align:middle line:84%
But also, just clarity
dreams themselves,

00:26:02.670 --> 00:26:05.520 align:middle line:84%
which are dreams of
archetypal significance.

00:26:05.520 --> 00:26:07.920 align:middle line:84%
Dreams where one might
receive spiritual teachings,

00:26:07.920 --> 00:26:10.830 align:middle line:84%
dreams where one might
receive an insight of clarity.

00:26:10.830 --> 00:26:13.140 align:middle line:84%
And that dream there sounds
like a clarity dream.

00:26:13.140 --> 00:26:16.387 align:middle line:84%
That was not your average dream
based on a daily experience.

00:26:16.387 --> 00:26:17.220 align:middle line:90%
And you can feel it.

00:26:17.220 --> 00:26:19.428 align:middle line:84%
People say-- how do I know
if it was a clarity dream?

00:26:19.428 --> 00:26:21.330 align:middle line:84%
Because the next
day, you'll feel it.

00:26:21.330 --> 00:26:22.130 align:middle line:90%
You'll remember it.

00:26:22.130 --> 00:26:23.760 align:middle line:84%
It will have
emotional resonance.

00:26:23.760 --> 00:26:26.370 align:middle line:84%
Sometimes even somatic,
physical, resonance.

00:26:26.370 --> 00:26:27.180 align:middle line:90%
And you realize--

00:26:27.180 --> 00:26:30.687 align:middle line:84%
OK, that dream wasn't coming
from my everyday mind.

00:26:30.687 --> 00:26:32.270 align:middle line:84%
That was coming from
something deeper.

00:26:32.270 --> 00:26:34.110 align:middle line:84%
Perhaps it was coming
from my Buddha mind--

00:26:34.110 --> 00:26:37.350 align:middle line:84%
my essentially, innately
enlightened essence.

00:26:37.350 --> 00:26:40.576 align:middle line:84%
Which every now and again
bursts through like a geyser

00:26:40.576 --> 00:26:41.700 align:middle line:90%
bursting through the earth.

00:26:41.700 --> 00:26:43.614 align:middle line:84%
And we get these
flashes of insight.

00:26:43.614 --> 00:26:45.780 align:middle line:84%
And through dream practice,
and through the training

00:26:45.780 --> 00:26:47.910 align:middle line:84%
that you obviously
are already doing,

00:26:47.910 --> 00:26:50.830 align:middle line:84%
we have more of these clarity
dreams and less samsaric

00:26:50.830 --> 00:26:51.630 align:middle line:90%
dreams.

00:26:51.630 --> 00:26:55.440 align:middle line:84%
Until it's said we're a fully
awakened being, dreams--

00:26:55.440 --> 00:26:57.260 align:middle line:84%
they stopped having
samsaric dreams.

00:26:57.260 --> 00:26:59.880 align:middle line:84%
So the only dreams they
have are the lucid dreams,

00:26:59.880 --> 00:27:01.920 align:middle line:84%
clarity dreams,
or the third type,

00:27:01.920 --> 00:27:04.290 align:middle line:84%
which is called clear
light experiences.

00:27:04.290 --> 00:27:07.680 align:middle line:84%
Which is an experience of
non-dual awareness within often

00:27:07.680 --> 00:27:10.140 align:middle line:90%
the deep sleep state.

00:27:10.140 --> 00:27:14.460 align:middle line:84%
That's definitely
beyond my paygrade.

00:27:14.460 --> 00:27:18.822 align:middle line:84%
But those are very, very
special experiences.

00:27:18.822 --> 00:27:22.400 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Why do dreams
feel more real than life?

00:27:22.400 --> 00:27:27.470 align:middle line:84%
What is it that's unbounded
there that makes a dream--

00:27:27.470 --> 00:27:30.860 align:middle line:84%
a clear dream-- live
within our mind,

00:27:30.860 --> 00:27:32.540 align:middle line:84%
within our field
of memories, even

00:27:32.540 --> 00:27:35.005 align:middle line:84%
so much stronger than a
quote earthly experience?

00:27:35.005 --> 00:27:37.400 align:middle line:84%
>>MORLEY: Great question--
a lot of people wake

00:27:37.400 --> 00:27:38.320 align:middle line:90%
from a lucid dream.

00:27:38.320 --> 00:27:41.600 align:middle line:84%
And they say the lucid dream
was like realer than real.

00:27:41.600 --> 00:27:43.870 align:middle line:84%
It was an experience
of hyper-reality.

00:27:43.870 --> 00:27:45.680 align:middle line:84%
And when you hear
people speak like that,

00:27:45.680 --> 00:27:48.500 align:middle line:84%
it can be easy to think they're
entering into hyperbole.

00:27:48.500 --> 00:27:49.990 align:middle line:90%
But actually, they're not.

00:27:49.990 --> 00:27:53.850 align:middle line:84%
A lucid dream is literally an
experience of hyper-reality.

00:27:53.850 --> 00:27:57.680 align:middle line:84%
For example, right now our
experience of this reality

00:27:57.680 --> 00:28:00.030 align:middle line:90%
is limited by our senses.

00:28:00.030 --> 00:28:03.260 align:middle line:84%
Our experience of touch is
limited by the sensitivity

00:28:03.260 --> 00:28:04.370 align:middle line:90%
of our fingertips.

00:28:04.370 --> 00:28:06.590 align:middle line:84%
Our experience of taste,
which I've already

00:28:06.590 --> 00:28:09.330 align:middle line:84%
as I'm getting older noticed
is declining with age.

00:28:09.330 --> 00:28:10.710 align:middle line:90%
I'm liking spicier foods.

00:28:10.710 --> 00:28:12.580 align:middle line:84%
I need more to get
that kick, right.

00:28:12.580 --> 00:28:16.340 align:middle line:84%
Eyesight-- any viewers who wear
glasses will know that right

00:28:16.340 --> 00:28:18.260 align:middle line:90%
now our experience of reality--

00:28:18.260 --> 00:28:22.580 align:middle line:84%
what we see-- is limited by
our vision, by our eyesight.

00:28:22.580 --> 00:28:27.317 align:middle line:84%
In the lucid dream, though,
you have perfect vision.

00:28:27.317 --> 00:28:29.150 align:middle line:84%
Because you're not
seeing through your eyes.

00:28:29.150 --> 00:28:30.710 align:middle line:90%
You're seeing through your mind.

00:28:30.710 --> 00:28:34.070 align:middle line:84%
In the lucid dream, you
have 100% taste capacity.

00:28:34.070 --> 00:28:36.290 align:middle line:84%
Because your experience
of taste is not

00:28:36.290 --> 00:28:38.824 align:middle line:84%
being tasted through the
tongue but through your mind.

00:28:38.824 --> 00:28:40.365 align:middle line:84%
Your experience of
touch, when people

00:28:40.365 --> 00:28:42.490 align:middle line:84%
say-- oh, when I touched
things in the lucid dream,

00:28:42.490 --> 00:28:43.880 align:middle line:90%
it felt so real.

00:28:43.880 --> 00:28:45.730 align:middle line:84%
It's because it's not
limited by the touch

00:28:45.730 --> 00:28:47.760 align:middle line:90%
senses on your fingertips.

00:28:47.760 --> 00:28:50.060 align:middle line:90%
It's through the unlimited mind.

00:28:50.060 --> 00:28:52.820 align:middle line:84%
So you can actually
experience a deeper sense

00:28:52.820 --> 00:28:56.270 align:middle line:84%
of reality, whatever that means,
in the lucid dream than you can

00:28:56.270 --> 00:28:57.830 align:middle line:90%
in the waking state.

00:28:57.830 --> 00:29:00.260 align:middle line:84%
And the cool thing is,
you can even boost it.

00:29:00.260 --> 00:29:02.000 align:middle line:84%
So you can do things
in the lucid dream

00:29:02.000 --> 00:29:03.740 align:middle line:90%
that boost your experience.

00:29:03.740 --> 00:29:05.250 align:middle line:90%
For example, eyesight--

00:29:05.250 --> 00:29:06.800 align:middle line:90%
I used to wear glasses.

00:29:06.800 --> 00:29:09.080 align:middle line:84%
And I was giving
a talk once where

00:29:09.080 --> 00:29:11.450 align:middle line:84%
I spoke about how I
healed an ear infection

00:29:11.450 --> 00:29:12.577 align:middle line:90%
through lucid dreaming.

00:29:12.577 --> 00:29:13.660 align:middle line:90%
I went into a lucid dream.

00:29:13.660 --> 00:29:15.410 align:middle line:90%
I did hands-on healing.

00:29:15.410 --> 00:29:18.170 align:middle line:84%
I sent out affirmations
of healing intent.

00:29:18.170 --> 00:29:19.980 align:middle line:84%
And the ear
infection got better.

00:29:19.980 --> 00:29:21.510 align:middle line:90%
I actually got heckled.

00:29:21.510 --> 00:29:23.510 align:middle line:84%
This dude-- it was a music
fest-- he heckled me.

00:29:23.510 --> 00:29:24.680 align:middle line:90%
I was wearing glasses.

00:29:24.680 --> 00:29:26.860 align:middle line:84%
He said-- oh, why don't
you fix your eyesight?

00:29:26.860 --> 00:29:28.310 align:middle line:90%
And I was so embarrassed.

00:29:28.310 --> 00:29:29.180 align:middle line:90%
And I went red.

00:29:29.180 --> 00:29:31.280 align:middle line:90%
And I just felt so ashamed.

00:29:31.280 --> 00:29:32.220 align:middle line:90%
And then I thought--

00:29:32.220 --> 00:29:36.050 align:middle line:84%
OK, if this is all a dream,
why did your shadow aspect,

00:29:36.050 --> 00:29:38.900 align:middle line:84%
this man, come into this dream
and give you that challenge?

00:29:38.900 --> 00:29:39.811 align:middle line:90%
Maybe it's a gift.

00:29:39.811 --> 00:29:41.560 align:middle line:84%
So I thought-- all
right, next lucid dream

00:29:41.560 --> 00:29:42.590 align:middle line:84%
I'm going to go
in there and try.

00:29:42.590 --> 00:29:45.245 align:middle line:84%
So I went into the lucid dream,
and I thought-- all right,

00:29:45.245 --> 00:29:46.440 align:middle line:90%
I'm going to heal my eyes.

00:29:46.440 --> 00:29:48.690 align:middle line:84%
So I did hands-on healing,
put my hands over my eyes.

00:29:48.690 --> 00:29:51.140 align:middle line:84%
I called out-- my
eyes are healed.

00:29:51.140 --> 00:29:52.670 align:middle line:90%
My immune system is boosted.

00:29:52.670 --> 00:29:54.560 align:middle line:90%
My eyesight is fixed.

00:29:54.560 --> 00:29:55.990 align:middle line:90%
Nothing happened.

00:29:55.990 --> 00:29:57.420 align:middle line:90%
I went in again a week later.

00:29:57.420 --> 00:29:59.360 align:middle line:84%
And I thought-- I'll
bring in the big guns.

00:29:59.360 --> 00:30:02.320 align:middle line:84%
So I tried the Tibetan Buddhist
mantra of the medicine Buddha.

00:30:02.320 --> 00:30:04.570 align:middle line:84%
In Tibetan Buddhism, there's
a mantra for everything--

00:30:04.570 --> 00:30:06.814 align:middle line:84%
a mantra to say when you're
going to the toilet, a mantra

00:30:06.814 --> 00:30:08.200 align:middle line:84%
to say when you
having sex, a mantra

00:30:08.200 --> 00:30:09.450 align:middle line:90%
to say when you're meditating.

00:30:09.450 --> 00:30:10.900 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So what
is the Tibetan--

00:30:10.900 --> 00:30:11.700 align:middle line:90%
can you share it?

00:30:11.700 --> 00:30:12.500 align:middle line:90%
>>MORLEY: I can.

00:30:12.500 --> 00:30:14.960 align:middle line:84%
The medicine Buddha mantra--
om bhaisajye bhaisajye

00:30:14.960 --> 00:30:16.860 align:middle line:84%
mahabhaisajye bhaisajyaraje
samudgate svaha.

00:30:16.860 --> 00:30:18.492 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: It sounds German.

00:30:18.492 --> 00:30:20.575 align:middle line:84%
>>MORLEY: Probably just
my terrible pronunciation.

00:30:20.575 --> 00:30:22.480 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: No, no-- it
just sounds German.

00:30:22.480 --> 00:30:24.260 align:middle line:84%
OK, say that again,
so somebody can

00:30:24.260 --> 00:30:26.780 align:middle line:84%
have a chance of going back
over it and memorizing it.

00:30:26.780 --> 00:30:30.640 align:middle line:84%
>>MORLEY: Om bhaisajye bhaisajye
mahabhaisajye bhaisajyaraje

00:30:30.640 --> 00:30:33.040 align:middle line:90%
samudgate svaha.

00:30:33.040 --> 00:30:34.520 align:middle line:84%
Any Tibetan scholars
out there, I'm

00:30:34.520 --> 00:30:36.561 align:middle line:90%
sorry for my mispronunciation.

00:30:36.561 --> 00:30:38.060 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Well,
you've impressed me.

00:30:38.060 --> 00:30:39.280 align:middle line:84%
But I don't know the
difference, right.

00:30:39.280 --> 00:30:40.560 align:middle line:90%
>>MORLEY: So I got lucid.

00:30:40.560 --> 00:30:42.164 align:middle line:84%
And I think-- wow,
I'll do the mantra.

00:30:42.164 --> 00:30:43.580 align:middle line:84%
So I start calling
out the mantra,

00:30:43.580 --> 00:30:45.050 align:middle line:90%
doing the hands-on healing.

00:30:45.050 --> 00:30:47.120 align:middle line:84%
And the dream did
start to shake.

00:30:47.120 --> 00:30:49.490 align:middle line:84%
Which for me often
represents a change.

00:30:49.490 --> 00:30:50.454 align:middle line:90%
But I woke up.

00:30:50.454 --> 00:30:51.870 align:middle line:84%
And actually,
nothing had changed.

00:30:51.870 --> 00:30:53.360 align:middle line:84%
I felt really good
because I said the mantra.

00:30:53.360 --> 00:30:54.570 align:middle line:90%
But nothing had changed.

00:30:54.570 --> 00:30:56.060 align:middle line:90%
Third time, lucky--

00:30:56.060 --> 00:30:57.780 align:middle line:90%
I get lucid a few days later.

00:30:57.780 --> 00:30:58.580 align:middle line:90%
I'll go in.

00:30:58.580 --> 00:30:59.900 align:middle line:90%
I'm about to say the mantra.

00:30:59.900 --> 00:31:01.940 align:middle line:10%
I'm about to do the
hands-on healing.

00:31:01.940 --> 00:31:04.730 align:middle line:10%
And then, like an
intercom over the dream,

00:31:04.730 --> 00:31:06.740 align:middle line:10%
this voice, my voice, said--

00:31:06.740 --> 00:31:09.410 align:middle line:10%
the reason you can't
see long distances

00:31:09.410 --> 00:31:12.900 align:middle line:10%
is because there is a
conflict within your eyes.

00:31:12.900 --> 00:31:15.110 align:middle line:84%
And for a minute, I
thought-- who said that?

00:31:15.110 --> 00:31:15.910 align:middle line:90%
That was me.

00:31:15.910 --> 00:31:19.565 align:middle line:84%
And I thought-- what a weird
thing to say, but he's right.

00:31:19.565 --> 00:31:22.390 align:middle line:84%
All illness is
based on conflict.

00:31:22.390 --> 00:31:25.120 align:middle line:84%
There's a conflict between
the muscles and the lens

00:31:25.120 --> 00:31:28.250 align:middle line:84%
or a conflict between what I
don't want to see in my life.

00:31:28.250 --> 00:31:30.550 align:middle line:84%
So in the lucid dream, I
forgot about the mantra.

00:31:30.550 --> 00:31:32.230 align:middle line:84%
I forgot about the
hands-on healing.

00:31:32.230 --> 00:31:33.280 align:middle line:90%
I flew into the sky.

00:31:33.280 --> 00:31:35.020 align:middle line:84%
And I called out in
the lucid dream--

00:31:35.020 --> 00:31:37.090 align:middle line:90%
my eyes a free of conflict.

00:31:37.090 --> 00:31:39.100 align:middle line:90%
My eyes a free of conflict.

00:31:39.100 --> 00:31:40.705 align:middle line:84%
And the dream was
like an earthquake.

00:31:40.705 --> 00:31:41.989 align:middle line:90%
So I go chssshhh.

00:31:41.989 --> 00:31:43.780 align:middle line:84%
And I thought-- oh,
something is happening.

00:31:43.780 --> 00:31:44.290 align:middle line:90%
Something's happening.

00:31:44.290 --> 00:31:45.206 align:middle line:90%
Something's happening.

00:31:45.206 --> 00:31:46.330 align:middle line:90%
And I wake up.

00:31:46.330 --> 00:31:47.920 align:middle line:84%
And I haven't worn
my glasses since.

00:31:47.920 --> 00:31:49.520 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Oh, that
is so powerful.

00:31:49.520 --> 00:31:50.407 align:middle line:90%
I love that story.

00:31:50.407 --> 00:31:51.490 align:middle line:90%
How bad was your eyesight?

00:31:51.490 --> 00:31:54.667 align:middle line:84%
>>MORLEY: OK, so I needed
it for theater, films.

00:31:54.667 --> 00:31:55.750 align:middle line:90%
I mean, it was pretty bad.

00:31:55.750 --> 00:31:57.375 align:middle line:84%
My friends used to
do this kind of game

00:31:57.375 --> 00:31:59.920 align:middle line:84%
where when we were driving
down the motorway, the highway.

00:31:59.920 --> 00:32:01.602 align:middle line:84%
They used to ask me
to read out signs

00:32:01.602 --> 00:32:03.310 align:middle line:84%
because I was so bad
at seeing the signs.

00:32:03.310 --> 00:32:05.470 align:middle line:90%
So pretty.

00:32:05.470 --> 00:32:06.790 align:middle line:90%
And is it perfect now?

00:32:06.790 --> 00:32:09.304 align:middle line:84%
No-- but it is a hell of
a lot better than it was.

00:32:09.304 --> 00:32:10.345 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: That's amazing.

00:32:10.345 --> 00:32:12.100 align:middle line:84%
>>MORLEY: So people
have said-- oh, it's

00:32:12.100 --> 00:32:13.660 align:middle line:90%
just the placebo effect.

00:32:13.660 --> 00:32:17.200 align:middle line:84%
Yes, but don't ever say
"just" before a phenomenon

00:32:17.200 --> 00:32:18.420 align:middle line:90%
like the placebo effect.

00:32:18.420 --> 00:32:21.220 align:middle line:84%
The placebo effect is the
most replicable finding

00:32:21.220 --> 00:32:22.190 align:middle line:90%
of medical research.

00:32:22.190 --> 00:32:22.990 align:middle line:90%
People forget that.

00:32:22.990 --> 00:32:24.910 align:middle line:90%
It's 60% to 80%, right.

00:32:24.910 --> 00:32:27.440 align:middle line:90%
So yes, it was just a placebo.

00:32:27.440 --> 00:32:29.950 align:middle line:84%
But if we think of the placebo
being the mind affecting

00:32:29.950 --> 00:32:33.220 align:middle line:84%
the body, imagine what happens
if you engage the placebo

00:32:33.220 --> 00:32:37.540 align:middle line:84%
effect within the mind, within
a huge three-dimensional

00:32:37.540 --> 00:32:39.660 align:middle line:84%
visualization of
your own psychology.

00:32:39.660 --> 00:32:41.596 align:middle line:84%
It's the placebo
effect but times 1,000.

00:32:41.596 --> 00:32:43.720 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And you said
something interesting there.

00:32:43.720 --> 00:32:45.470 align:middle line:90%
Because you said the third time.

00:32:45.470 --> 00:32:48.510 align:middle line:84%
And oftentimes in dreams,
three is important--

00:32:48.510 --> 00:32:50.000 align:middle line:90%
triplets of experience.

00:32:50.000 --> 00:32:51.375 align:middle line:84%
Let's talk about
that phenomenon.

00:32:51.375 --> 00:32:54.550 align:middle line:84%
>>MORLEY: I think sometimes
we give up too soon.

00:32:54.550 --> 00:32:55.690 align:middle line:90%
People have a lucid dream.

00:32:55.690 --> 00:32:58.270 align:middle line:84%
And maybe they want to
heal their inner child.

00:32:58.270 --> 00:32:59.780 align:middle line:90%
They had childhood trauma.

00:32:59.780 --> 00:33:00.760 align:middle line:90%
So they get lucid.

00:33:00.760 --> 00:33:02.560 align:middle line:84%
And one of the best
ways to do this

00:33:02.560 --> 00:33:04.720 align:middle line:84%
is to call forth
your inner child--

00:33:04.720 --> 00:33:08.070 align:middle line:84%
the personification of
your childhood experience.

00:33:08.070 --> 00:33:08.870 align:middle line:90%
So they get lucid.

00:33:08.870 --> 00:33:10.600 align:middle line:84%
They call out for
the inner child.

00:33:10.600 --> 00:33:11.620 align:middle line:90%
And nothing happens.

00:33:11.620 --> 00:33:13.630 align:middle line:84%
And they wake up and
say-- it hasn't worked.

00:33:13.630 --> 00:33:15.640 align:middle line:84%
Now, think who your
inner child is.

00:33:15.640 --> 00:33:16.900 align:middle line:90%
Maybe they're shy.

00:33:16.900 --> 00:33:19.450 align:middle line:84%
If they're traumatized,
they're definitely shy, right.

00:33:19.450 --> 00:33:21.040 align:middle line:84%
So calling them once
isn't going to be enough.

00:33:21.040 --> 00:33:22.290 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: They're
hiding under the porch.

00:33:22.290 --> 00:33:24.400 align:middle line:84%
>>MORLEY: Exactly-- but
if we can go back there

00:33:24.400 --> 00:33:26.440 align:middle line:90%
a second time, a third time.

00:33:26.440 --> 00:33:27.910 align:middle line:84%
I call my inner
child little Chuck.

00:33:27.910 --> 00:33:30.034 align:middle line:84%
Because when I was a kid
I was always called Chuck.

00:33:30.034 --> 00:33:31.060 align:middle line:90%
So I say-- little Chuck.

00:33:31.060 --> 00:33:32.360 align:middle line:90%
And eventually, he comes.

00:33:32.360 --> 00:33:34.600 align:middle line:84%
But I have to show little
Chuck I come in peace.

00:33:34.600 --> 00:33:35.400 align:middle line:90%
I've come to heal.

00:33:35.400 --> 00:33:36.760 align:middle line:90%
I've come to say I love you.

00:33:36.760 --> 00:33:38.590 align:middle line:90%
I've come to make things right.

00:33:38.590 --> 00:33:40.277 align:middle line:90%
So often, I don't think--

00:33:40.277 --> 00:33:41.860 align:middle line:84%
maybe it's not even
the rule of three.

00:33:41.860 --> 00:33:43.990 align:middle line:84%
Maybe it's the rule
of trying again.

00:33:43.990 --> 00:33:46.480 align:middle line:84%
They say with certain Buddhist
teachings-- you as the lama

00:33:46.480 --> 00:33:47.740 align:middle line:90%
once, they'll say no.

00:33:47.740 --> 00:33:49.960 align:middle line:84%
You ask them a second time,
they'll say stop asking.

00:33:49.960 --> 00:33:52.335 align:middle line:84%
You ask them a third time,
they'll give you the teaching.

00:33:52.335 --> 00:33:54.695 align:middle line:84%
Maybe it's the
same with eyesight.

00:33:54.695 --> 00:33:57.010 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So you talk about
anomalies in the book.

00:33:57.010 --> 00:33:59.560 align:middle line:84%
And you say-- look
out for anomalies

00:33:59.560 --> 00:34:01.660 align:middle line:84%
because those are
what are giving

00:34:01.660 --> 00:34:04.185 align:middle line:84%
a very specific
indication in the dream.

00:34:04.185 --> 00:34:06.850 align:middle line:84%
>>MORLEY: Exactly-- so these
are called dream signs.

00:34:06.850 --> 00:34:09.280 align:middle line:84%
So one of the easiest
ways to get lucid

00:34:09.280 --> 00:34:11.618 align:middle line:84%
is, first of all, to
keep a dream diary,

00:34:11.618 --> 00:34:12.909 align:middle line:90%
to start recording your dreams.

00:34:12.909 --> 00:34:13.719 align:middle line:90%
Anyone out there who thinks--

00:34:13.719 --> 00:34:15.190 align:middle line:90%
I don't remember my dreams--

00:34:15.190 --> 00:34:16.839 align:middle line:90%
I would advise them to try.

00:34:16.839 --> 00:34:18.130 align:middle line:90%
It seems like a trick question.

00:34:18.130 --> 00:34:19.750 align:middle line:84%
But when I meet
people who say they

00:34:19.750 --> 00:34:22.750 align:middle line:84%
don't remember their dreams,
I say-- when did you last try?

00:34:22.750 --> 00:34:25.360 align:middle line:84%
And they go-- oh, well, I don't
try because I don't remember.

00:34:25.360 --> 00:34:26.776 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: You're
absolutely right.

00:34:26.776 --> 00:34:29.230 align:middle line:84%
It's just a matter of
instructing yourself--

00:34:29.230 --> 00:34:31.510 align:middle line:84%
I want to remember this
dream tonight or bring

00:34:31.510 --> 00:34:33.790 align:middle line:84%
through something that is
significant enough for me

00:34:33.790 --> 00:34:35.929 align:middle line:90%
to remember when I wake up.

00:34:35.929 --> 00:34:38.889 align:middle line:84%
I used to even say to
my subconscious-- wake

00:34:38.889 --> 00:34:41.860 align:middle line:84%
me at the moment
the dream ceases,

00:34:41.860 --> 00:34:43.780 align:middle line:84%
even if it's an
inconvenient time.

00:34:43.780 --> 00:34:44.949 align:middle line:90%
>>MORLEY: Perfect.

00:34:44.949 --> 00:34:47.454 align:middle line:84%
So anyone out there who's
forgotten their alarm clock,

00:34:47.454 --> 00:34:49.120 align:middle line:84%
and they're staying
awake worried that--

00:34:49.120 --> 00:34:50.230 align:middle line:84%
I have to wake up at 6
o'clock in the morning

00:34:50.230 --> 00:34:51.550 align:middle line:90%
to catch my flight.

00:34:51.550 --> 00:34:53.010 align:middle line:90%
They wake up at 5:59.

00:34:53.010 --> 00:34:55.719 align:middle line:84%
We know there is, what
Carl Jung referred to,

00:34:55.719 --> 00:34:57.430 align:middle line:90%
a conscious unconscious.

00:34:57.430 --> 00:34:59.290 align:middle line:84%
And that is the bit
we're talking to.

00:34:59.290 --> 00:35:00.830 align:middle line:84%
So first of all,
set our intention

00:35:00.830 --> 00:35:01.788 align:middle line:90%
to remember our dreams.

00:35:01.788 --> 00:35:03.580 align:middle line:84%
And then, document our
dreams in some way.

00:35:03.580 --> 00:35:04.434 align:middle line:90%
Write them down.

00:35:04.434 --> 00:35:06.850 align:middle line:84%
Now, in this practice, the
reason we write down our dreams

00:35:06.850 --> 00:35:08.470 align:middle line:90%
isn't so much to interpret them.

00:35:08.470 --> 00:35:10.970 align:middle line:84%
Although personally I'm quite
a fan of dream interpretation.

00:35:10.970 --> 00:35:14.050 align:middle line:84%
But that's a different kettle
of fish, as we say in England.

00:35:14.050 --> 00:35:16.934 align:middle line:84%
The reason we write down our
dreams is to spot patterns.

00:35:16.934 --> 00:35:18.850 align:middle line:84%
So let's say a couple
of weeks of writing down

00:35:18.850 --> 00:35:21.391 align:middle line:84%
our dreams every night, maybe
two or three dreams every night

00:35:21.391 --> 00:35:22.230 align:middle line:90%
if we can.

00:35:22.230 --> 00:35:25.960 align:middle line:84%
After a couple of weeks,
we've got this amount of data.

00:35:25.960 --> 00:35:28.300 align:middle line:84%
And we want to look through
this amount of data and spot

00:35:28.300 --> 00:35:29.200 align:middle line:90%
patterns.

00:35:29.200 --> 00:35:30.700 align:middle line:90%
So we see-- oh, wow, look.

00:35:30.700 --> 00:35:34.410 align:middle line:84%
Every week or so, twice a week,
I dream of my dead grandmother.

00:35:34.410 --> 00:35:36.760 align:middle line:84%
Or-- wow, once a week I
dream I'm naked in public.

00:35:36.760 --> 00:35:38.511 align:middle line:84%
Or-- wow, every few
days I have that dream

00:35:38.511 --> 00:35:40.676 align:middle line:84%
I've missed the train or
I've missed the bus to work

00:35:40.676 --> 00:35:41.500 align:middle line:90%
or whatever.

00:35:41.500 --> 00:35:43.080 align:middle line:90%
So we see these patterns.

00:35:43.080 --> 00:35:45.460 align:middle line:84%
And what we do is, we
create lucidity triggers.

00:35:45.460 --> 00:35:47.710 align:middle line:84%
So my one used to
be my dead grandma.

00:35:47.710 --> 00:35:50.770 align:middle line:84%
So before I went to sleep, I
would say-- all right, Charlie.

00:35:50.770 --> 00:35:53.530 align:middle line:84%
The next time you see
J-- my dead grandma--

00:35:53.530 --> 00:35:55.850 align:middle line:84%
you know that you're
dreaming because she's dead.

00:35:55.850 --> 00:35:57.520 align:middle line:90%
So it's gotta be the dream.

00:35:57.520 --> 00:36:01.110 align:middle line:84%
If between now and breakfast--
make it even more condensed.

00:36:01.110 --> 00:36:04.430 align:middle line:84%
If between now and breakfast
I see J, I am dreaming.

00:36:04.430 --> 00:36:06.880 align:middle line:84%
Or if between now and
breakfast I'm naked in public,

00:36:06.880 --> 00:36:09.040 align:middle line:90%
I'm hopefully dreaming.

00:36:09.040 --> 00:36:10.290 align:middle line:90%
You create these triggers.

00:36:10.290 --> 00:36:11.790 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Or you've
taken something.

00:36:11.790 --> 00:36:12.740 align:middle line:90%
>>MORLEY: Exactly.

00:36:12.740 --> 00:36:13.922 align:middle line:90%
So you're probably dreaming.

00:36:13.922 --> 00:36:15.880 align:middle line:84%
So basically, yeah, you
write down your dreams.

00:36:15.880 --> 00:36:18.040 align:middle line:84%
You spot patterns,
these dream signs.

00:36:18.040 --> 00:36:20.450 align:middle line:84%
And then, you have the
intention to dream about them.

00:36:20.450 --> 00:36:22.152 align:middle line:84%
So a few months ago,
my dream signs--

00:36:22.152 --> 00:36:24.110 align:middle line:84%
probably because we've
been trying for a baby--

00:36:24.110 --> 00:36:27.230 align:middle line:84%
my dream signs became
talking baby animals,

00:36:27.230 --> 00:36:30.830 align:middle line:84%
like cute little
talking baby panda bears

00:36:30.830 --> 00:36:33.130 align:middle line:90%
and talking baby seals.

00:36:33.130 --> 00:36:34.130 align:middle line:90%
And this kept on coming.

00:36:34.130 --> 00:36:35.134 align:middle line:90%
I wasn't getting lucid.

00:36:35.134 --> 00:36:37.550 align:middle line:84%
And I said-- right, next time
I see a talking baby animal,

00:36:37.550 --> 00:36:38.990 align:middle line:90%
I know I'm dreaming.

00:36:38.990 --> 00:36:41.470 align:middle line:84%
And then, a few nights later,
the talking panda bears

00:36:41.470 --> 00:36:42.270 align:middle line:90%
came out.

00:36:42.270 --> 00:36:44.700 align:middle line:84%
But I'm engaged in deep
conversation about veganism,

00:36:44.700 --> 00:36:45.500 align:middle line:90%
actually.

00:36:45.500 --> 00:36:48.755 align:middle line:84%
The panda was upset that I was
vegetarian and not full vegan.

00:36:48.755 --> 00:36:50.880 align:middle line:84%
And I was saying-- well,
I'm trying, but it's hard.

00:36:50.880 --> 00:36:51.838 align:middle line:90%
I'm addicted to cheese.

00:36:51.838 --> 00:36:53.536 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: I'm not
drinking panda milk.

00:36:53.536 --> 00:36:56.720 align:middle line:84%
>>MORLEY: This panda was really
concerned with me being vegan.

00:36:56.720 --> 00:36:59.450 align:middle line:84%
And halfway through, I went--
am I discussing veganism

00:36:59.450 --> 00:37:01.460 align:middle line:90%
with a talking baby panda?

00:37:01.460 --> 00:37:02.840 align:middle line:90%
I've got to be dreaming.

00:37:02.840 --> 00:37:04.160 align:middle line:90%
I became lucid.

00:37:04.160 --> 00:37:06.270 align:middle line:84%
And then of course once
you're lucid, if you want,

00:37:06.270 --> 00:37:07.670 align:middle line:90%
you can ask the panda--

00:37:07.670 --> 00:37:08.990 align:middle line:90%
what do you represent?

00:37:08.990 --> 00:37:11.140 align:middle line:84%
And in this case, your
wish to have a baby.

00:37:11.140 --> 00:37:12.885 align:middle line:84%
And you're like--
oh, that's so cool.

00:37:12.885 --> 00:37:14.510 align:middle line:84%
And then you can go
off and do whatever

00:37:14.510 --> 00:37:15.400 align:middle line:90%
you want to do in the dream.

00:37:15.400 --> 00:37:18.085 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Well, you would think
I would have been clued off

00:37:18.085 --> 00:37:22.460 align:middle line:84%
that I was in a dream when I was
dreaming about these little--

00:37:22.460 --> 00:37:25.010 align:middle line:84%
I dream about animals
that don't exist.

00:37:25.010 --> 00:37:26.930 align:middle line:84%
And this one was
a little pig dog.

00:37:26.930 --> 00:37:29.510 align:middle line:84%
And it's a little pig
that looks like a dog.

00:37:29.510 --> 00:37:32.480 align:middle line:84%
And it's all raw and pink
except for a little strip

00:37:32.480 --> 00:37:35.760 align:middle line:84%
of brown shag carpet
around the center.

00:37:35.760 --> 00:37:38.520 align:middle line:84%
>>MORLEY: I pray that
tonight I dream of a pig dog

00:37:38.520 --> 00:37:40.130 align:middle line:84%
and that I get
lucid at that time.

00:37:40.130 --> 00:37:43.100 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: I have dreams about
the craziest little animals.

00:37:43.100 --> 00:37:44.300 align:middle line:90%
They're all cute as can be.

00:37:44.300 --> 00:37:46.219 align:middle line:84%
But none of them
exist in this world.

00:37:46.219 --> 00:37:47.885 align:middle line:84%
They're strange little
hybrid creatures.

00:37:47.885 --> 00:37:48.740 align:middle line:90%
>>MORLEY: This is beautiful.

00:37:48.740 --> 00:37:50.060 align:middle line:90%
I love hearing this stuff.

00:37:50.060 --> 00:37:53.660 align:middle line:84%
Because I, straight away
when I hear people's dreams,

00:37:53.660 --> 00:37:55.290 align:middle line:90%
go-- it's their mind.

00:37:55.290 --> 00:37:57.110 align:middle line:84%
So I love the fact
that, in your mind

00:37:57.110 --> 00:38:02.630 align:middle line:84%
specifically, there are all
of these unrecognized cute

00:38:02.630 --> 00:38:03.460 align:middle line:90%
animals.

00:38:03.460 --> 00:38:04.668 align:middle line:90%
What does that say about you?

00:38:04.668 --> 00:38:07.470 align:middle line:84%
This mind has this
kind of creativity,

00:38:07.470 --> 00:38:10.400 align:middle line:84%
this mind that has this cute
animalistic aspect within it.

00:38:10.400 --> 00:38:11.560 align:middle line:90%
It's so great.

00:38:11.560 --> 00:38:12.530 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: I love it.

00:38:12.530 --> 00:38:14.770 align:middle line:90%
OK, so sex is common in dreams.

00:38:14.770 --> 00:38:17.410 align:middle line:84%
And you talk about this
a little bit in the book.

00:38:17.410 --> 00:38:19.850 align:middle line:84%
But one thing-- you
have a cautionary note.

00:38:19.850 --> 00:38:24.050 align:middle line:84%
Don't become addicted to going
there in your lucid dreams.

00:38:24.050 --> 00:38:26.810 align:middle line:84%
I mean, this is something
coming up big time

00:38:26.810 --> 00:38:29.780 align:middle line:84%
in the world of
virtual reality that's

00:38:29.780 --> 00:38:32.630 align:middle line:84%
going to be probably the number
one sales driver, is my guess,

00:38:32.630 --> 00:38:33.490 align:middle line:90%
is going to be sex.

00:38:33.490 --> 00:38:34.323 align:middle line:90%
>>MORLEY: Sex sells.

00:38:34.323 --> 00:38:36.590 align:middle line:84%
I've often thought if
I wrote a book called

00:38:36.590 --> 00:38:38.720 align:middle line:84%
Have Sex with your
Deeper Self: Learn

00:38:38.720 --> 00:38:40.190 align:middle line:84%
the Art of Lucid
Dreaming, I'd sell

00:38:40.190 --> 00:38:41.480 align:middle line:90%
a million more copies, right.

00:38:41.480 --> 00:38:41.960 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: There you go.

00:38:41.960 --> 00:38:42.470 align:middle line:90%
But let's talk about that.

00:38:42.470 --> 00:38:45.020 align:middle line:84%
Because you can do the same
thing in your dream time

00:38:45.020 --> 00:38:46.040 align:middle line:90%
in lucid dreaming.

00:38:46.040 --> 00:38:47.870 align:middle line:84%
>>MORLEY: Yes, I
learned to lucid dream

00:38:47.870 --> 00:38:49.640 align:middle line:90%
when I was 16 years old.

00:38:49.640 --> 00:38:51.700 align:middle line:84%
So you imagine this
16-year-old before he's

00:38:51.700 --> 00:38:53.996 align:middle line:84%
got into Buddhism,
who read these books,

00:38:53.996 --> 00:38:55.370 align:middle line:84%
gets quite good
at this practice,

00:38:55.370 --> 00:38:58.700 align:middle line:84%
and gains access to this huge
virtual reality simulation.

00:38:58.700 --> 00:39:00.920 align:middle line:84%
Which feels as real
as waking life,

00:39:00.920 --> 00:39:02.616 align:middle line:84%
where the rules of
society don't apply.

00:39:02.616 --> 00:39:04.490 align:middle line:84%
You can imagine what I
spent the first, like,

00:39:04.490 --> 00:39:06.550 align:middle line:84%
two years of my lucid
dreaming practice

00:39:06.550 --> 00:39:08.090 align:middle line:90%
doing-- sex and skateboarding.

00:39:08.090 --> 00:39:10.292 align:middle line:84%
Which at 16 were my
two favorite things.

00:39:10.292 --> 00:39:11.750 align:middle line:84%
Skateboarding I
was doing a lot of.

00:39:11.750 --> 00:39:13.470 align:middle line:90%
Sex not so much.

00:39:13.470 --> 00:39:15.141 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Right, but
in your dream time.

00:39:15.141 --> 00:39:16.640 align:middle line:84%
>>MORLEY: Yes, so
I would get lucid.

00:39:16.640 --> 00:39:17.330 align:middle line:90%
And they would appear.

00:39:17.330 --> 00:39:18.360 align:middle line:84%
And they would
look so realistic.

00:39:18.360 --> 00:39:20.276 align:middle line:84%
And I'd have all this
sexual fantasy and stuff

00:39:20.276 --> 00:39:21.400 align:middle line:90%
and then go skateboarding.

00:39:21.400 --> 00:39:24.320 align:middle line:90%
And was it harmful?

00:39:24.320 --> 00:39:25.190 align:middle line:90%
Was it harmless?

00:39:25.190 --> 00:39:26.510 align:middle line:90%
I don't know.

00:39:26.510 --> 00:39:28.630 align:middle line:84%
Now I know all this stuff
about neural pathways.

00:39:28.630 --> 00:39:31.040 align:middle line:84%
I think-- maybe that
wasn't such a good thing

00:39:31.040 --> 00:39:33.889 align:middle line:84%
to be doing to my neural
pathways at that age.

00:39:33.889 --> 00:39:36.430 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Right, because they
were definitely firing together

00:39:36.430 --> 00:39:37.230 align:middle line:90%
through repetition.

00:39:37.230 --> 00:39:39.770 align:middle line:84%
>>MORLEY: Exactly, and if I
look at some of my relationships

00:39:39.770 --> 00:39:42.830 align:middle line:84%
with women in those late
teens, I got into some trouble

00:39:42.830 --> 00:39:44.750 align:middle line:84%
with relationships
and objectification

00:39:44.750 --> 00:39:47.660 align:middle line:90%
and an out-of-control sexuality.

00:39:47.660 --> 00:39:49.592 align:middle line:84%
My main thing to
people now is, you

00:39:49.592 --> 00:39:51.050 align:middle line:84%
don't need to make
the same mistake

00:39:51.050 --> 00:39:55.460 align:middle line:84%
as 16-year-old completely
unawakened Charlie.

00:39:55.460 --> 00:39:57.890 align:middle line:84%
If you do want to engage
sex in lucid dreams,

00:39:57.890 --> 00:39:59.600 align:middle line:90%
there's nothing wrong with it.

00:39:59.600 --> 00:40:02.780 align:middle line:84%
I've worked with the
Portland guy Maxwell Hunter,

00:40:02.780 --> 00:40:04.360 align:middle line:90%
who was not born Maxwell.

00:40:04.360 --> 00:40:05.570 align:middle line:90%
He was born--

00:40:05.570 --> 00:40:06.861 align:middle line:90%
I don't know what his name was.

00:40:06.861 --> 00:40:08.690 align:middle line:84%
But he was born a
female, a woman.

00:40:08.690 --> 00:40:10.160 align:middle line:84%
And he was using
the lucid dream--

00:40:10.160 --> 00:40:12.920 align:middle line:84%
before he had transition
and the operation--

00:40:12.920 --> 00:40:16.670 align:middle line:84%
to go into the lucid dream
state and transform his body

00:40:16.670 --> 00:40:17.930 align:middle line:90%
into the body of a man.

00:40:17.930 --> 00:40:20.210 align:middle line:84%
He was exploring
gender and sexuality

00:40:20.210 --> 00:40:23.390 align:middle line:84%
within the lucid dream in an
incredibly deep and powerful

00:40:23.390 --> 00:40:27.590 align:middle line:84%
psychological way to aid
his psychological transition

00:40:27.590 --> 00:40:29.060 align:middle line:90%
from woman into man.

00:40:29.060 --> 00:40:34.380 align:middle line:84%
Another lady who was worried
actually about her sexuality--

00:40:34.380 --> 00:40:35.900 align:middle line:90%
it became a worry for her.

00:40:35.900 --> 00:40:38.840 align:middle line:84%
In the lucid dream state, she
was able to engage worry-free

00:40:38.840 --> 00:40:41.960 align:middle line:84%
sexual activity, same
sex relationship,

00:40:41.960 --> 00:40:43.430 align:middle line:90%
to explore this and realize--

00:40:43.430 --> 00:40:45.740 align:middle line:84%
OK, yes, there is part of
me that does enjoy this.

00:40:45.740 --> 00:40:47.720 align:middle line:84%
It's not that sex in
lucid dreams is wrong.

00:40:47.720 --> 00:40:51.320 align:middle line:84%
It's that getting addicted
to anything as an escapism

00:40:51.320 --> 00:40:52.272 align:middle line:90%
can be harmful.

00:40:52.272 --> 00:40:53.730 align:middle line:84%
So we need to be
careful with that.

00:40:53.730 --> 00:40:57.140 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And besides, you
have VR goggles for it anyway.

00:40:57.140 --> 00:40:58.950 align:middle line:84%
Soon coming to a
theater near you.

00:40:58.950 --> 00:40:59.750 align:middle line:90%
>>MORLEY: Exactly.

00:40:59.750 --> 00:41:02.570 align:middle line:84%
But for your first few
lucid dreams, first time

00:41:02.570 --> 00:41:05.210 align:middle line:84%
we're lucid, why not
engage sexual fantasy?

00:41:05.210 --> 00:41:08.570 align:middle line:84%
But there comes a point where
we put away childish things.

00:41:08.570 --> 00:41:11.360 align:middle line:84%
And we go-- OK, we can spend
our lucid dreams just having

00:41:11.360 --> 00:41:12.920 align:middle line:90%
sex and fantasy.

00:41:12.920 --> 00:41:14.420 align:middle line:84%
But from a Buddhist
point of view--

00:41:14.420 --> 00:41:16.490 align:middle line:84%
a place where you have
seven times the power

00:41:16.490 --> 00:41:19.640 align:middle line:84%
of consciousness, a state where
you are closer to your fully

00:41:19.640 --> 00:41:21.700 align:middle line:84%
enlightened nature than
you are right now--

00:41:21.700 --> 00:41:24.480 align:middle line:84%
it would seem such a waste
to spend all our lucid dreams

00:41:24.480 --> 00:41:25.280 align:middle line:90%
doing that.

00:41:25.280 --> 00:41:25.990 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Absolutely,
and I thought

00:41:25.990 --> 00:41:27.650 align:middle line:84%
it was worth a
mention in your book.

00:41:27.650 --> 00:41:29.860 align:middle line:84%
And one of the things
I wanted to bring up

00:41:29.860 --> 00:41:33.130 align:middle line:84%
is repetitious dreams, where
we have repetitive dreams.

00:41:33.130 --> 00:41:35.980 align:middle line:84%
And sometimes they can last
a lifetime, or sometimes

00:41:35.980 --> 00:41:38.050 align:middle line:90%
just during a period of life.

00:41:38.050 --> 00:41:40.450 align:middle line:84%
And I'll just toss
one out as an example.

00:41:40.450 --> 00:41:42.490 align:middle line:90%
When I was very little--

00:41:42.490 --> 00:41:45.760 align:middle line:84%
probably I'm guessing ages
three to six, right in there--

00:41:45.760 --> 00:41:49.360 align:middle line:84%
I had dreams that there was
this gigantic spider that

00:41:49.360 --> 00:41:52.450 align:middle line:90%
would fill up half of a room.

00:41:52.450 --> 00:41:56.320 align:middle line:84%
And everyone around
would be dead except me.

00:41:56.320 --> 00:41:57.580 align:middle line:90%
And it would say--

00:41:57.580 --> 00:41:59.660 align:middle line:90%
you're fine.

00:41:59.660 --> 00:42:00.460 align:middle line:90%
You're fine.

00:42:00.460 --> 00:42:02.200 align:middle line:90%
You won't be harmed.

00:42:02.200 --> 00:42:04.172 align:middle line:90%
And I'm afraid of spiders.

00:42:04.172 --> 00:42:06.130 align:middle line:84%
>>MORLEY: And how long
did you have that dream?

00:42:06.130 --> 00:42:07.838 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Well, I had
it for a few years.

00:42:07.838 --> 00:42:09.516 align:middle line:90%
>>MORLEY: When did it stop?

00:42:09.516 --> 00:42:11.330 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: I don't
think I had it probably

00:42:11.330 --> 00:42:14.600 align:middle line:84%
anymore after the age of
about seven is my guess.

00:42:14.600 --> 00:42:18.710 align:middle line:84%
>>MORLEY: What I would love
to do is to go back in time,

00:42:18.710 --> 00:42:21.330 align:middle line:84%
have you keep a dream diary
throughout your childhood

00:42:21.330 --> 00:42:24.500 align:middle line:84%
so we could see when
they were occurring

00:42:24.500 --> 00:42:26.630 align:middle line:84%
and also to see
when they stopped.

00:42:26.630 --> 00:42:29.510 align:middle line:84%
What happened during that
day in your seventh year

00:42:29.510 --> 00:42:32.030 align:middle line:84%
that integrated that aspect
of your psychology, which

00:42:32.030 --> 00:42:35.670 align:middle line:84%
was crying out to you again
and again to be integrated?

00:42:35.670 --> 00:42:38.780 align:middle line:84%
What happened during the day,
or perhaps in the dream, that

00:42:38.780 --> 00:42:39.920 align:middle line:90%
stopped it happening?

00:42:39.920 --> 00:42:41.690 align:middle line:84%
The great thing about
repetitious dreams

00:42:41.690 --> 00:42:44.270 align:middle line:84%
is they are the unconscious
saying-- you haven't quite

00:42:44.270 --> 00:42:45.240 align:middle line:90%
got the message yet.

00:42:45.240 --> 00:42:47.630 align:middle line:84%
So it will keep on giving
it to you again and again.

00:42:47.630 --> 00:42:49.705 align:middle line:84%
Which why so often
nightmares repeat.

00:42:49.705 --> 00:42:51.080 align:middle line:84%
So much more often
than the dream

00:42:51.080 --> 00:42:53.910 align:middle line:84%
where you're having a lunch date
with your favorite Hollywood

00:42:53.910 --> 00:42:54.710 align:middle line:90%
actor.

00:42:54.710 --> 00:42:56.690 align:middle line:84%
Because the lunch date dream
with your favorite Hollywood

00:42:56.690 --> 00:42:57.950 align:middle line:90%
actor was fully integrated.

00:42:57.950 --> 00:42:59.030 align:middle line:90%
You loved it, right.

00:42:59.030 --> 00:43:01.310 align:middle line:84%
But the nightmares,
we reject, we deny.

00:43:01.310 --> 00:43:03.980 align:middle line:84%
So they have to keep coming
back with the same message.

00:43:03.980 --> 00:43:05.420 align:middle line:90%
I had one where--

00:43:05.420 --> 00:43:07.100 align:middle line:84%
when my dad left
my mom, I started

00:43:07.100 --> 00:43:09.500 align:middle line:84%
having these recurring
dreams about my dad

00:43:09.500 --> 00:43:11.640 align:middle line:84%
appearing as a really
violent figure.

00:43:11.640 --> 00:43:14.510 align:middle line:84%
And I thought I was
cool with my dad.

00:43:14.510 --> 00:43:16.850 align:middle line:90%
I was in my mid-20s by now.

00:43:16.850 --> 00:43:18.050 align:middle line:90%
But obviously, it wasn't.

00:43:18.050 --> 00:43:19.490 align:middle line:90%
My psyche was saying-- no, man.

00:43:19.490 --> 00:43:23.150 align:middle line:84%
Your father archetype is
wounded and is violent.

00:43:23.150 --> 00:43:24.650 align:middle line:90%
So I did the work.

00:43:24.650 --> 00:43:28.940 align:middle line:10%
And I did a brilliant exercise
from a book called Manhood.

00:43:28.940 --> 00:43:31.820 align:middle line:84%
One of these chapters is
about fixing your relationship

00:43:31.820 --> 00:43:32.675 align:middle line:90%
with your dad.

00:43:32.675 --> 00:43:34.550 align:middle line:84%
And it involved spending
a day with your dad,

00:43:34.550 --> 00:43:36.920 align:middle line:84%
getting him to journey
back into his past,

00:43:36.920 --> 00:43:39.530 align:middle line:84%
go back to his school, go
back to where he was born,

00:43:39.530 --> 00:43:40.970 align:middle line:90%
ask him about his father--

00:43:40.970 --> 00:43:43.400 align:middle line:84%
this great kind of deep
psychological work.

00:43:43.400 --> 00:43:46.880 align:middle line:84%
The day after I did that
practice day with your dad,

00:43:46.880 --> 00:43:47.870 align:middle line:90%
the dream changed.

00:43:47.870 --> 00:43:48.770 align:middle line:90%
I dreamed of my dad.

00:43:48.770 --> 00:43:51.510 align:middle line:84%
And it was the first time in
about a year since he broke up

00:43:51.510 --> 00:43:54.410 align:middle line:84%
with Mum that he didn't
appear was a violent figure.

00:43:54.410 --> 00:43:56.047 align:middle line:90%
He appeared his normal size.

00:43:56.047 --> 00:43:57.380 align:middle line:90%
We were sitting by a river bank.

00:43:57.380 --> 00:44:00.066 align:middle line:84%
And he was feeding me
sandwiches in silence.

00:44:00.066 --> 00:44:01.190 align:middle line:90%
And I woke up and thought--

00:44:01.190 --> 00:44:01.990 align:middle line:90%
I've done it.

00:44:01.990 --> 00:44:03.020 align:middle line:90%
We've done it.

00:44:03.020 --> 00:44:04.560 align:middle line:84%
We've integrated
our relationship.

00:44:04.560 --> 00:44:06.556 align:middle line:84%
I didn't need to pick
up the dream dictionary

00:44:06.556 --> 00:44:08.180 align:middle line:84%
or speak to a dream
therapist for that.

00:44:08.180 --> 00:44:09.300 align:middle line:90%
It was so obvious.

00:44:09.300 --> 00:44:11.840 align:middle line:84%
He had gone from this
violent, aggressive figure

00:44:11.840 --> 00:44:13.940 align:middle line:84%
to a placid figure
that was nourishing me

00:44:13.940 --> 00:44:15.560 align:middle line:90%
as we sat by the water element.

00:44:15.560 --> 00:44:18.890 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Right-- I
love those dreams where

00:44:18.890 --> 00:44:20.190 align:middle line:90%
it comes to that completion.

00:44:20.190 --> 00:44:21.689 align:middle line:84%
And I'm going to
toss one little one

00:44:21.689 --> 00:44:25.880 align:middle line:84%
in too-- repetitious dream that
lasted for probably 40 years.

00:44:25.880 --> 00:44:28.520 align:middle line:84%
Starting again and about three,
living in San Francisco, which

00:44:28.520 --> 00:44:30.200 align:middle line:90%
is where I'm from and was born.

00:44:30.200 --> 00:44:32.390 align:middle line:84%
And being in the
backseat of a car

00:44:32.390 --> 00:44:35.810 align:middle line:84%
that would be hurtling down
Venice Avenue toward the water

00:44:35.810 --> 00:44:37.110 align:middle line:90%
with no driver in the front.

00:44:37.110 --> 00:44:40.009 align:middle line:84%
So completely out of
control and afraid.

00:44:40.009 --> 00:44:42.050 align:middle line:84%
And then, I'd wake up
before the car would crash.

00:44:42.050 --> 00:44:43.109 align:middle line:90%
That's how it started.

00:44:43.109 --> 00:44:45.150 align:middle line:84%
Went through life, and I
get my driver's license.

00:44:45.150 --> 00:44:46.250 align:middle line:90%
Now I'm in control.

00:44:46.250 --> 00:44:49.185 align:middle line:90%
Now I'm on the driver's side.

00:44:49.185 --> 00:44:50.060 align:middle line:90%
And I have the wheel.

00:44:50.060 --> 00:44:52.490 align:middle line:84%
And I have passengers
I'm responsible for.

00:44:52.490 --> 00:44:56.210 align:middle line:90%
Slippery, snowy, icy roads--

00:44:56.210 --> 00:44:59.770 align:middle line:84%
navigating them to a
certain point of proficiency

00:44:59.770 --> 00:45:01.610 align:middle line:84%
but white knuckling
it the whole time.

00:45:01.610 --> 00:45:05.630 align:middle line:84%
The final dream ended
probably a decade and a half

00:45:05.630 --> 00:45:08.780 align:middle line:84%
ago now, maybe two
decades ago when

00:45:08.780 --> 00:45:10.152 align:middle line:90%
I was in the city of Berkeley.

00:45:10.152 --> 00:45:11.860 align:middle line:84%
It looked like a Wayne
Thiebaud painting,

00:45:11.860 --> 00:45:14.330 align:middle line:84%
these vertiginous
streets, like straight up.

00:45:14.330 --> 00:45:19.940 align:middle line:84%
And I was driving on this street
that was at a very steep pitch.

00:45:19.940 --> 00:45:20.750 align:middle line:90%
And I thought--

00:45:20.750 --> 00:45:21.890 align:middle line:90%
I don't know.

00:45:21.890 --> 00:45:23.570 align:middle line:90%
And then, I saw the top.

00:45:23.570 --> 00:45:28.746 align:middle line:84%
It looped back on itself
almost like a roller coaster

00:45:28.746 --> 00:45:29.870 align:middle line:90%
before it straightened out.

00:45:29.870 --> 00:45:32.120 align:middle line:84%
And I thought--
that's impossible.

00:45:32.120 --> 00:45:33.830 align:middle line:90%
That's physically impossible.

00:45:33.830 --> 00:45:36.650 align:middle line:84%
But I saw a red Corvette
do it ahead of me.

00:45:36.650 --> 00:45:38.390 align:middle line:90%
I watched the red Corvette.

00:45:38.390 --> 00:45:39.760 align:middle line:90%
And the driver was male.

00:45:39.760 --> 00:45:41.250 align:middle line:90%
And he executed it perfectly.

00:45:41.250 --> 00:45:43.610 align:middle line:84%
There were no other
drivers on this road.

00:45:43.610 --> 00:45:46.730 align:middle line:84%
And I thought-- if
I watched him do it,

00:45:46.730 --> 00:45:48.420 align:middle line:90%
that means it can be done.

00:45:48.420 --> 00:45:51.170 align:middle line:90%
And so I just hit it.

00:45:51.170 --> 00:45:54.470 align:middle line:84%
And I just knew what
to do and how much

00:45:54.470 --> 00:45:57.830 align:middle line:84%
to step on the gas to get
right through before stalling

00:45:57.830 --> 00:46:00.840 align:middle line:84%
out and making it over the
top onto the street ahead.

00:46:00.840 --> 00:46:01.640 align:middle line:90%
And that was it.

00:46:01.640 --> 00:46:05.240 align:middle line:84%
That was the end of those dreams
of having mastered this thing.

00:46:05.240 --> 00:46:07.310 align:middle line:84%
>>MORLEY: Yes, and
that dream sounds

00:46:07.310 --> 00:46:09.470 align:middle line:84%
like such a perfect
metaphor for life

00:46:09.470 --> 00:46:12.140 align:middle line:84%
because sometimes we
feel like we're hurtling.

00:46:12.140 --> 00:46:14.070 align:middle line:84%
And then, we have a
family or relationship.

00:46:14.070 --> 00:46:16.403 align:middle line:84%
And suddenly, there are other
people in the car with us.

00:46:16.403 --> 00:46:17.510 align:middle line:90%
And we're still hurtling.

00:46:17.510 --> 00:46:19.130 align:middle line:84%
But at a certain
point, we realize

00:46:19.130 --> 00:46:21.860 align:middle line:84%
that actually rather than
hurtling down, we're going up.

00:46:21.860 --> 00:46:23.420 align:middle line:90%
And it loops back.

00:46:23.420 --> 00:46:25.370 align:middle line:90%
And that we were always safe.

00:46:25.370 --> 00:46:27.770 align:middle line:84%
And it reminds you of a
quote from a Tibetan lama,

00:46:27.770 --> 00:46:29.420 align:middle line:90%
Chogyam Trungpa Rinpoche.

00:46:29.420 --> 00:46:32.060 align:middle line:84%
He said-- the bad news
is, you're falling.

00:46:32.060 --> 00:46:33.800 align:middle line:84%
The good news is,
there's no ground.

00:46:33.800 --> 00:46:37.340 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Yes-- yeah, it felt
like a real accomplishment

00:46:37.340 --> 00:46:39.840 align:middle line:84%
in that I was
responsible for others.

00:46:39.840 --> 00:46:42.410 align:middle line:84%
It defied everything
I believed to be true.

00:46:42.410 --> 00:46:43.940 align:middle line:90%
But I did it anyway.

00:46:43.940 --> 00:46:45.920 align:middle line:84%
And so it was breaking
through that barrier

00:46:45.920 --> 00:46:48.770 align:middle line:84%
of what can be done, of
the impossible-- walking

00:46:48.770 --> 00:46:50.130 align:middle line:90%
through the wall, really.

00:46:50.130 --> 00:46:51.710 align:middle line:84%
>>MORLEY: Yes--
and again, I would

00:46:51.710 --> 00:46:54.140 align:middle line:84%
love to know what was happening
in your life at that time

00:46:54.140 --> 00:46:56.210 align:middle line:84%
that you had that
dream of completion.

00:46:56.210 --> 00:46:58.190 align:middle line:90%
Because it's never random.

00:46:58.190 --> 00:46:59.115 align:middle line:90%
It's never random.

00:46:59.115 --> 00:47:01.970 align:middle line:84%
Our dreams can seem random
because they're speaking

00:47:01.970 --> 00:47:03.890 align:middle line:90%
a language we don't understand.

00:47:03.890 --> 00:47:05.750 align:middle line:84%
And they can seem to
appear at random times.

00:47:05.750 --> 00:47:07.774 align:middle line:84%
Because most of us are
completely out of sync

00:47:07.774 --> 00:47:09.190 align:middle line:84%
with what's going
on with the moon

00:47:09.190 --> 00:47:12.050 align:middle line:84%
cycles, our own cycle,
all this kind of stuff.

00:47:12.050 --> 00:47:13.540 align:middle line:84%
But if we are in
sync, we realize

00:47:13.540 --> 00:47:16.750 align:middle line:84%
that we get the dreams we need
at exactly the right time.

00:47:16.750 --> 00:47:20.920 align:middle line:84%
There is an innate enlightened
intelligence within us

00:47:20.920 --> 00:47:23.680 align:middle line:84%
which shines through in
the dreams and guides us,

00:47:23.680 --> 00:47:26.570 align:middle line:84%
but only if we are willing to
listen and take our fingers out

00:47:26.570 --> 00:47:27.370 align:middle line:90%
of our ears.

00:47:27.370 --> 00:47:28.420 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Absolutely.

00:47:28.420 --> 00:47:30.135 align:middle line:90%
OK, let's talk about the 1%--

00:47:30.135 --> 00:47:33.250 align:middle line:84%
the 1% of times when
it's not just you.

00:47:33.250 --> 00:47:36.490 align:middle line:84%
>>MORLEY: OK, so 99% of
everything in the lucid dream

00:47:36.490 --> 00:47:37.832 align:middle line:90%
is your own psychology.

00:47:37.832 --> 00:47:39.790 align:middle line:10%
We know this from a
neurological point of view.

00:47:39.790 --> 00:47:41.956 align:middle line:84%
Because you can see the
different parts of the brain

00:47:41.956 --> 00:47:43.600 align:middle line:84%
firing when you're
riding a bicycle

00:47:43.600 --> 00:47:45.808 align:middle line:84%
in lucid dream, when you're
fighting in lucid dreams.

00:47:45.808 --> 00:47:48.376 align:middle line:84%
So they know it's connected
to the brain and the mind.

00:47:48.376 --> 00:47:49.750 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: But
might the mind just

00:47:49.750 --> 00:47:52.885 align:middle line:84%
be showing a processing
of a real experience?

00:47:52.885 --> 00:47:53.941 align:middle line:90%
>>MORLEY: Exactly.

00:47:53.941 --> 00:47:56.440 align:middle line:84%
So neuroscience will say-- oh,
everything in the lucid dream

00:47:56.440 --> 00:47:57.240 align:middle line:90%
is your own mind.

00:47:57.240 --> 00:47:58.600 align:middle line:90%
It's all your own psychology.

00:47:58.600 --> 00:48:02.350 align:middle line:84%
And I guess I used to
think the same thing too.

00:48:02.350 --> 00:48:04.900 align:middle line:84%
Tibetan Buddhism says--
no, we've got this wrong.

00:48:04.900 --> 00:48:06.566 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: I agree
with Tibetan Buddhism.

00:48:06.566 --> 00:48:09.760 align:middle line:84%
>>MORLEY: Yeah, and then my
experience showed it was wrong.

00:48:09.760 --> 00:48:10.570 align:middle line:90%
There are times--

00:48:10.570 --> 00:48:12.440 align:middle line:90%
I'd say it's 1% of the time.

00:48:12.440 --> 00:48:15.100 align:middle line:84%
Maybe it's more like
10% of the time.

00:48:15.100 --> 00:48:17.530 align:middle line:84%
Where we are experiencing
something in our lucid dream

00:48:17.530 --> 00:48:22.150 align:middle line:84%
state that is not us, that is
sourced from something wider.

00:48:22.150 --> 00:48:24.760 align:middle line:84%
I've noted three main
places this comes from.

00:48:24.760 --> 00:48:26.800 align:middle line:84%
One is from the
collective unconscious--

00:48:26.800 --> 00:48:29.770 align:middle line:84%
deep, archetypal,
oceanic consciousness

00:48:29.770 --> 00:48:32.950 align:middle line:84%
that exists both within
our own unconscious

00:48:32.950 --> 00:48:35.980 align:middle line:84%
but also in the
universal unconscious.

00:48:35.980 --> 00:48:37.990 align:middle line:90%
The appearance of ancestors--

00:48:37.990 --> 00:48:41.080 align:middle line:84%
I believe when you have a
blood or bone ancestry, when

00:48:41.080 --> 00:48:44.080 align:middle line:84%
that ancestor dies, it
is far easier for them

00:48:44.080 --> 00:48:46.030 align:middle line:84%
to communicate through
your lucid dreams

00:48:46.030 --> 00:48:47.630 align:middle line:90%
than it is in the waking state.

00:48:47.630 --> 00:48:49.120 align:middle line:84%
Because right now,
it's so solid.

00:48:49.120 --> 00:48:50.140 align:middle line:90%
We feel so separate.

00:48:50.140 --> 00:48:51.677 align:middle line:90%
There's such duality here.

00:48:51.677 --> 00:48:53.260 align:middle line:84%
Whereas if this was
a lucid dream now,

00:48:53.260 --> 00:48:56.890 align:middle line:84%
I'd know that it was my inner
you, that this table was me.

00:48:56.890 --> 00:49:00.070 align:middle line:84%
So I'm already in a state
moving towards non-duality.

00:49:00.070 --> 00:49:02.890 align:middle line:84%
So it would be a
preferential state

00:49:02.890 --> 00:49:05.170 align:middle line:90%
for ancestral communication.

00:49:05.170 --> 00:49:07.210 align:middle line:90%
And the third one is--

00:49:07.210 --> 00:49:09.190 align:middle line:84%
again, I can't give you
any science for this.

00:49:09.190 --> 00:49:11.610 align:middle line:90%
But I can tell you I believe it.

00:49:11.610 --> 00:49:15.520 align:middle line:84%
An epiphenomenon of full
spiritual enlightenment

00:49:15.520 --> 00:49:19.210 align:middle line:84%
is the ability to enter
other people's dreams.

00:49:19.210 --> 00:49:20.700 align:middle line:84%
Now, people might
get freaked out.

00:49:20.700 --> 00:49:21.730 align:middle line:84%
Oh, this means people
can enter my dreams.

00:49:21.730 --> 00:49:24.370 align:middle line:84%
Only the good guys can do it
because it's an epiphenomenon

00:49:24.370 --> 00:49:26.380 align:middle line:90%
of full spiritual awakening.

00:49:26.380 --> 00:49:28.710 align:middle line:84%
So if someone is fully
spiritually awakened,

00:49:28.710 --> 00:49:30.460 align:middle line:84%
you want them to be
coming into your dream

00:49:30.460 --> 00:49:32.850 align:middle line:84%
to give you teachings and to
help you, and to guide you.

00:49:32.850 --> 00:49:34.765 align:middle line:84%
So anyone who's worried
about-- oh, the dark shamans

00:49:34.765 --> 00:49:36.400 align:middle line:84%
being able to get
in my dreams-- no.

00:49:36.400 --> 00:49:40.630 align:middle line:84%
The level of consciousness
required to intentionally enter

00:49:40.630 --> 00:49:42.880 align:middle line:84%
into somebody else's
dream while they're lucid

00:49:42.880 --> 00:49:46.630 align:middle line:84%
is so high that it
negates the harmful people

00:49:46.630 --> 00:49:47.680 align:middle line:90%
from being able to do it.

00:49:47.680 --> 00:49:50.050 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Absolutely--
and what about the voice?

00:49:50.050 --> 00:49:52.330 align:middle line:84%
When you hear the voice,
it's giving very important

00:49:52.330 --> 00:49:54.040 align:middle line:90%
instructive information.

00:49:54.040 --> 00:49:55.540 align:middle line:84%
>>MORLEY: I read
something recently

00:49:55.540 --> 00:49:59.140 align:middle line:84%
by Carl Jung where he talked
about the voice of the highest

00:49:59.140 --> 00:50:01.960 align:middle line:84%
self in a dream seeming
like it was coming

00:50:01.960 --> 00:50:03.910 align:middle line:90%
from kind of a third person.

00:50:03.910 --> 00:50:06.214 align:middle line:84%
So in that dream I had
where I healed my eyes,

00:50:06.214 --> 00:50:08.380 align:middle line:84%
and it was like a voice--
my voice-- but coming over

00:50:08.380 --> 00:50:09.180 align:middle line:90%
almost an intercom.

00:50:09.180 --> 00:50:12.010 align:middle line:84%
I thought-- that
was my higher self.

00:50:12.010 --> 00:50:14.461 align:middle line:84%
That was what in
Buddhist terminology

00:50:14.461 --> 00:50:16.960 align:middle line:84%
we would call the Buddha nature,
the already-awakened aspect

00:50:16.960 --> 00:50:17.760 align:middle line:90%
of our self.

00:50:17.760 --> 00:50:20.650 align:middle line:84%
Carl Jung called it
the self with a big S.

00:50:20.650 --> 00:50:22.810 align:middle line:84%
And then, the post-Jungians
call it the higher self

00:50:22.810 --> 00:50:24.940 align:middle line:84%
to make that kind
of differentiation.

00:50:24.940 --> 00:50:26.890 align:middle line:84%
I truly believe
that higher self can

00:50:26.890 --> 00:50:29.110 align:middle line:84%
talk to us in the
lucid dream state

00:50:29.110 --> 00:50:31.060 align:middle line:90%
as well as the waking state.

00:50:31.060 --> 00:50:34.090 align:middle line:84%
But we have the
eyes open to see it

00:50:34.090 --> 00:50:37.990 align:middle line:84%
and the ears open to hear it
far better in the lucid dream

00:50:37.990 --> 00:50:39.760 align:middle line:84%
than we sometimes do
in the waking state.

00:50:39.760 --> 00:50:41.176 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Because
sometimes it can

00:50:41.176 --> 00:50:43.300 align:middle line:84%
bring in symbolism
or imagery that's

00:50:43.300 --> 00:50:46.270 align:middle line:84%
familiar or linked up with
what they're about to tell you.

00:50:46.270 --> 00:50:48.400 align:middle line:84%
So you're already in a
prepared state to hear it.

00:50:48.400 --> 00:50:50.650 align:middle line:84%
>>MORLEY: Your higher
self will appear to you

00:50:50.650 --> 00:50:53.470 align:middle line:84%
in your lucid dreams
based upon and sourced

00:50:53.470 --> 00:50:57.700 align:middle line:84%
from your personal relationship
to your internal archetypes.

00:50:57.700 --> 00:51:00.700 align:middle line:84%
So for example, my higher
self in the lucid dream

00:51:00.700 --> 00:51:04.390 align:middle line:84%
will often appear as Buddha or
my guru Lama Yeshe Rinpoche.

00:51:04.390 --> 00:51:06.760 align:middle line:84%
A Christian practitioner,
their higher self

00:51:06.760 --> 00:51:10.300 align:middle line:84%
might appear in the dream
as Mother Mary or Jesus.

00:51:10.300 --> 00:51:12.580 align:middle line:84%
A Sufi practitioner,
one of the great poets

00:51:12.580 --> 00:51:15.430 align:middle line:84%
Rumi or Hafez might appear in
the lucid dream as their higher

00:51:15.430 --> 00:51:16.230 align:middle line:90%
self.

00:51:16.230 --> 00:51:17.890 align:middle line:90%
It's the same as when we die.

00:51:17.890 --> 00:51:19.330 align:middle line:90%
The same process occurs.

00:51:19.330 --> 00:51:21.310 align:middle line:84%
But your angels
and your demons are

00:51:21.310 --> 00:51:23.440 align:middle line:84%
different from my
angels and my demons.

00:51:23.440 --> 00:51:26.290 align:middle line:84%
They will be based on
our archetypal internal

00:51:26.290 --> 00:51:27.415 align:middle line:90%
relationships.

00:51:27.415 --> 00:51:29.470 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So do
you or do you not

00:51:29.470 --> 00:51:31.750 align:middle line:84%
believe that we
can actually meet

00:51:31.750 --> 00:51:33.450 align:middle line:90%
with each other in dream time?

00:51:33.450 --> 00:51:36.490 align:middle line:10%
>>MORLEY: I believe
it is possible.

00:51:36.490 --> 00:51:38.920 align:middle line:84%
I believe-- because
the lucid dream state

00:51:38.920 --> 00:51:40.930 align:middle line:84%
is said to be a state
where your sixth sense

00:51:40.930 --> 00:51:45.790 align:middle line:84%
capacity or clairvoyance is
heightened-- that if you were

00:51:45.790 --> 00:51:49.930 align:middle line:84%
in a lucid dream and I was in
a lucid dream at the same time.

00:51:49.930 --> 00:51:52.670 align:middle line:84%
So we were both sleeping at the
same time, physical reality.

00:51:52.670 --> 00:51:54.940 align:middle line:84%
The possibility of
psychic communication

00:51:54.940 --> 00:51:57.449 align:middle line:84%
would be hundreds
of times greater

00:51:57.449 --> 00:51:59.740 align:middle line:84%
than the possibility of
psychic communication right now

00:51:59.740 --> 00:52:01.420 align:middle line:90%
in the waking state.

00:52:01.420 --> 00:52:03.190 align:middle line:90%
So yes, it is possible.

00:52:03.190 --> 00:52:04.480 align:middle line:90%
And yes, it is try-able.

00:52:04.480 --> 00:52:06.430 align:middle line:84%
And I would ask
people to experiment.

00:52:06.430 --> 00:52:09.250 align:middle line:10%
If you and your partner can
get into lucid dreaming,

00:52:09.250 --> 00:52:11.365 align:middle line:10%
see if you can
communicate psychically.

00:52:11.365 --> 00:52:14.680 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: OK, so in your
book, you write about Antonio

00:52:14.680 --> 00:52:16.630 align:middle line:84%
and smoking and
overcoming smoking.

00:52:16.630 --> 00:52:18.130 align:middle line:84%
So we're going to
give a really kind

00:52:18.130 --> 00:52:22.615 align:middle line:84%
of simple, direct example of
how you can help heal something.

00:52:22.615 --> 00:52:25.180 align:middle line:84%
>>MORLEY: So Antonio
saw me give that talk

00:52:25.180 --> 00:52:29.470 align:middle line:84%
where I was referencing how
I healed my ear infection.

00:52:29.470 --> 00:52:31.120 align:middle line:90%
And it was at a music festival.

00:52:31.120 --> 00:52:33.490 align:middle line:84%
So he came to me
and was saying--

00:52:33.490 --> 00:52:36.040 align:middle line:84%
do you think I can heal
my addiction to nicotine

00:52:36.040 --> 00:52:37.180 align:middle line:90%
through the lucid dream?

00:52:37.180 --> 00:52:38.050 align:middle line:90%
And if so, how?

00:52:38.050 --> 00:52:40.591 align:middle line:84%
And I was talking about-- oh,
you could go in the lucid dream

00:52:40.591 --> 00:52:42.160 align:middle line:90%
and call out affirmations.

00:52:42.160 --> 00:52:44.410 align:middle line:84%
I live a healthy lifestyle
free of the addiction

00:52:44.410 --> 00:52:46.750 align:middle line:84%
of cigarettes-- classic
hypnotic suggestion stuff

00:52:46.750 --> 00:52:48.010 align:middle line:90%
in the lucid dream.

00:52:48.010 --> 00:52:50.260 align:middle line:84%
But he was way more
creative than me.

00:52:50.260 --> 00:52:51.070 align:middle line:90%
He got lucid.

00:52:51.070 --> 00:52:54.100 align:middle line:84%
And he thought-- well, where
is the source of my addiction?

00:52:54.100 --> 00:52:57.320 align:middle line:84%
For him, he believed the source
of his addiction was his brain.

00:52:57.320 --> 00:52:58.304 align:middle line:90%
So he became lucid.

00:52:58.304 --> 00:53:00.220 align:middle line:84%
And once he was lucid--
oh, wow, I'm dreaming.

00:53:00.220 --> 00:53:01.270 align:middle line:90%
OK, I'm asleep in bed.

00:53:01.270 --> 00:53:02.920 align:middle line:90%
But now I'm in my mind.

00:53:02.920 --> 00:53:05.330 align:middle line:90%
He called out to meet his brain.

00:53:05.330 --> 00:53:07.450 align:middle line:90%
So he goes-- my brain, my brain.

00:53:07.450 --> 00:53:09.200 align:middle line:90%
And this woman walks in.

00:53:09.200 --> 00:53:10.877 align:middle line:84%
And he's like--
are you my brain?

00:53:10.877 --> 00:53:13.460 align:middle line:84%
And she's kind of nonplussed and
goes-- yeah, I am your brain.

00:53:13.460 --> 00:53:17.350 align:middle line:84%
And he goes-- wow, well,
how am I physically?

00:53:17.350 --> 00:53:19.240 align:middle line:90%
And she goes-- you're OK.

00:53:19.240 --> 00:53:20.940 align:middle line:84%
But you know what
you need to stop?

00:53:20.940 --> 00:53:21.965 align:middle line:90%
And he kind of--

00:53:21.965 --> 00:53:23.160 align:middle line:90%
it's the smoking, isn't it?

00:53:23.160 --> 00:53:24.250 align:middle line:90%
She went-- yep.

00:53:24.250 --> 00:53:25.541 align:middle line:90%
Was kind of like that with him.

00:53:25.541 --> 00:53:27.100 align:middle line:84%
And he went-- well,
how can I stop?

00:53:27.100 --> 00:53:28.016 align:middle line:90%
And she looked at him.

00:53:28.016 --> 00:53:30.340 align:middle line:84%
And he said-- well,
every time I think

00:53:30.340 --> 00:53:32.470 align:middle line:84%
about a cigarette, every
time I want a cigarette,

00:53:32.470 --> 00:53:34.136 align:middle line:84%
will you make me think
of something else

00:53:34.136 --> 00:53:35.020 align:middle line:90%
or do something else?

00:53:35.020 --> 00:53:37.900 align:middle line:84%
And his brain in the form of
this woman just went-- yep.

00:53:37.900 --> 00:53:38.860 align:middle line:90%
And he woke up.

00:53:38.860 --> 00:53:42.010 align:middle line:84%
Short lucid dream-- we're
talking like 30 seconds, right.

00:53:42.010 --> 00:53:44.020 align:middle line:84%
And he didn't smoke
again for two weeks.

00:53:44.020 --> 00:53:45.320 align:middle line:90%
Two weeks later, he emails me.

00:53:45.320 --> 00:53:46.540 align:middle line:90%
He tells me this dream.

00:53:46.540 --> 00:53:48.137 align:middle line:84%
To be honest, I'm
a bit skeptical.

00:53:48.137 --> 00:53:50.720 align:middle line:84%
I was thinking-- well, maybe it
was just a big dose of placebo

00:53:50.720 --> 00:53:52.428 align:middle line:84%
because it was such
a strong lucid dream.

00:53:52.428 --> 00:53:54.397 align:middle line:84%
Can you let me
know in two months?

00:53:54.397 --> 00:53:55.980 align:middle line:84%
Two months later, I
get another email.

00:53:55.980 --> 00:53:57.610 align:middle line:84%
He's like-- I'm still
not smoking, dude.

00:53:57.610 --> 00:53:59.470 align:middle line:84%
Now at this point, I'm
writing the second book.

00:53:59.470 --> 00:54:01.386 align:middle line:84%
So I'm thinking-- oh,
what a great case study.

00:54:01.386 --> 00:54:03.540 align:middle line:84%
But I've got to make
sure this is for real.

00:54:03.540 --> 00:54:05.290 align:middle line:84%
So I thought-- well,
I can't just ask him.

00:54:05.290 --> 00:54:07.330 align:middle line:84%
I need to call
someone close to him.

00:54:07.330 --> 00:54:09.850 align:middle line:84%
So I spoke to his boyfriend,
who's called Charlie actually.

00:54:09.850 --> 00:54:12.460 align:middle line:84%
And Charlie is a smoker
and was still a smoker.

00:54:12.460 --> 00:54:13.930 align:middle line:84%
So Charlie was
smoking around him.

00:54:13.930 --> 00:54:16.221 align:middle line:84%
He said-- yeah, he hasn't
smoked since the lucid dream.

00:54:16.221 --> 00:54:18.010 align:middle line:84%
But also, something
strange has happened.

00:54:18.010 --> 00:54:20.009 align:middle line:84%
Antonio usually does
our weekly shop.

00:54:20.009 --> 00:54:21.550 align:middle line:84%
And I give him the
list of everything

00:54:21.550 --> 00:54:25.210 align:middle line:84%
to buy in the shops, including
my weekly cigarettes.

00:54:25.210 --> 00:54:26.920 align:middle line:84%
And he said-- for a
couple of weeks now,

00:54:26.920 --> 00:54:29.170 align:middle line:84%
Antonio has come back with
everything on the list

00:54:29.170 --> 00:54:31.690 align:middle line:84%
from the shops but
not the cigarettes.

00:54:31.690 --> 00:54:33.360 align:middle line:90%
Why could that be?

00:54:33.360 --> 00:54:34.250 align:middle line:90%
And then I thought--

00:54:34.250 --> 00:54:37.370 align:middle line:84%
OK, I remember from my hypnosis
training in my early 20s.

00:54:37.370 --> 00:54:39.730 align:middle line:84%
There's something called
negative hallucination.

00:54:39.730 --> 00:54:42.610 align:middle line:84%
Which is if you can implant a
hypnotic suggestion deep enough

00:54:42.610 --> 00:54:44.890 align:middle line:84%
into someone's unconscious,
they will literally not

00:54:44.890 --> 00:54:47.200 align:middle line:84%
see what you have
hypnotized them to see.

00:54:47.200 --> 00:54:49.510 align:middle line:84%
And I thought-- could it be
that he was literally not

00:54:49.510 --> 00:54:52.180 align:middle line:84%
even seeing the word cigarette
on the shopping list?

00:54:52.180 --> 00:54:52.980 align:middle line:90%
I don't know.

00:54:52.980 --> 00:54:54.880 align:middle line:84%
But since then,
I've wheeled Antonio

00:54:54.880 --> 00:54:57.130 align:middle line:84%
out in London a few times
actually to show he exists.

00:54:57.130 --> 00:54:58.070 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: I love it.

00:54:58.070 --> 00:55:00.130 align:middle line:84%
>>MORLEY: But the last time he
came, I was teaching nearby.

00:55:00.130 --> 00:55:01.200 align:middle line:90%
And I said-- oh, here's Antonio.

00:55:01.200 --> 00:55:02.491 align:middle line:90%
He hasn't smoked for two years.

00:55:02.491 --> 00:55:04.020 align:middle line:90%
And he went--

00:55:04.020 --> 00:55:04.920 align:middle line:90%
And I was like--

00:55:04.920 --> 00:55:05.720 align:middle line:90%
what do you mean?

00:55:05.720 --> 00:55:06.880 align:middle line:90%
He went--

00:55:06.880 --> 00:55:11.150 align:middle line:84%
Oh, OK-- it turns out Antonio
has smoked for two years.

00:55:11.150 --> 00:55:11.950 align:middle line:90%
I thought-- oh, no.

00:55:11.950 --> 00:55:12.700 align:middle line:90%
So I gave him the mic.

00:55:12.700 --> 00:55:13.500 align:middle line:90%
And he said--

00:55:13.500 --> 00:55:16.810 align:middle line:84%
OK, I just wanted to check
if it was still in place.

00:55:16.810 --> 00:55:18.310 align:middle line:84%
Because it had
been two years now.

00:55:18.310 --> 00:55:19.580 align:middle line:90%
So I did have a cigarette.

00:55:19.580 --> 00:55:21.290 align:middle line:84%
I said-- oh, well, what happened
when you had the cigarette?

00:55:21.290 --> 00:55:23.456 align:middle line:84%
He said-- I had two puffs,
and they were disgusting.

00:55:23.456 --> 00:55:26.770 align:middle line:10%
So he even tested it two years
later, and was still in place.

00:55:26.770 --> 00:55:29.140 align:middle line:84%
Again, viewers might think--
oh, just a heavy dose

00:55:29.140 --> 00:55:30.240 align:middle line:90%
of the placebo.

00:55:30.240 --> 00:55:31.790 align:middle line:90%
Yep, but so what?

00:55:31.790 --> 00:55:32.590 align:middle line:90%
It works.

00:55:32.590 --> 00:55:34.890 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: The one thing
that does work is placebo.

00:55:34.890 --> 00:55:39.580 align:middle line:84%
So we'll put that against
most any chemical solution.

00:55:39.580 --> 00:55:41.580 align:middle line:90%
People love flying dreams.

00:55:41.580 --> 00:55:42.730 align:middle line:90%
Comment on flying dreams.

00:55:42.730 --> 00:55:45.460 align:middle line:84%
And then, add in another
couple archetypal dreams

00:55:45.460 --> 00:55:47.950 align:middle line:84%
and what you think their
particular meaning is.

00:55:47.950 --> 00:55:49.810 align:middle line:10%
>>MORLEY: So I used
to think that once you

00:55:49.810 --> 00:55:52.660 align:middle line:10%
got lucid in a dream and you
chose to fly that maybe it's

00:55:52.660 --> 00:55:55.870 align:middle line:10%
kind of a waste just spending
your lucid dreams flying about.

00:55:55.870 --> 00:55:58.180 align:middle line:84%
And then, I looked into the
Tibetan literature on it.

00:55:58.180 --> 00:56:00.220 align:middle line:84%
And actually, they say
flying in a lucid dream

00:56:00.220 --> 00:56:01.180 align:middle line:90%
is a great thing to do.

00:56:01.180 --> 00:56:03.130 align:middle line:90%
Because it expresses freedom.

00:56:03.130 --> 00:56:06.485 align:middle line:84%
And it moves the mind beyond
its habitual limitations.

00:56:06.485 --> 00:56:08.740 align:middle line:84%
Because just like walking
through a brick wall,

00:56:08.740 --> 00:56:10.510 align:middle line:84%
what is the other
thing that human beings

00:56:10.510 --> 00:56:11.770 align:middle line:90%
believe to be impossible?

00:56:11.770 --> 00:56:15.910 align:middle line:84%
Human flight-- so actually,
when we fly in a lucid dream,

00:56:15.910 --> 00:56:18.460 align:middle line:84%
what's happening to
our neural pathways?

00:56:18.460 --> 00:56:20.710 align:middle line:84%
When we fly, I mean, it's
creating neural pathways

00:56:20.710 --> 00:56:23.320 align:middle line:84%
saying the impossible
is possible.

00:56:23.320 --> 00:56:25.330 align:middle line:84%
Now, how will that
affect our waking life--

00:56:25.330 --> 00:56:27.760 align:middle line:84%
that impossible business
project, that impossible

00:56:27.760 --> 00:56:30.490 align:middle line:84%
creative venture, that
impossible relationship

00:56:30.490 --> 00:56:32.450 align:middle line:84%
that we've always
thought was beyond us?

00:56:32.450 --> 00:56:35.020 align:middle line:84%
If we fly in our lucid
dreams, maybe that's

00:56:35.020 --> 00:56:37.510 align:middle line:84%
creating an atmosphere
of possibility that

00:56:37.510 --> 00:56:38.882 align:middle line:90%
will affect our waking state.

00:56:38.882 --> 00:56:40.090 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: That's interesting.

00:56:40.090 --> 00:56:41.840 align:middle line:84%
I would have never
thought of it that way.

00:56:41.840 --> 00:56:43.270 align:middle line:84%
Give us a couple
archetypal dreams

00:56:43.270 --> 00:56:46.510 align:middle line:84%
like flying that many
people experience that have

00:56:46.510 --> 00:56:47.590 align:middle line:90%
that kind of great value.

00:56:47.590 --> 00:56:49.631 align:middle line:84%
>>MORLEY: There's an
interesting archetypal dream

00:56:49.631 --> 00:56:50.739 align:middle line:90%
around teeth falling out.

00:56:50.739 --> 00:56:52.030 align:middle line:90%
Now, a lot of people have this.

00:56:52.030 --> 00:56:54.820 align:middle line:84%
Again, from Zimbabwe
to Mexico you'll

00:56:54.820 --> 00:56:56.500 align:middle line:90%
find people having this dream.

00:56:56.500 --> 00:56:59.710 align:middle line:84%
And people ask-- why
is it so universal?

00:56:59.710 --> 00:57:01.990 align:middle line:84%
Think about what your
teeth are used for.

00:57:01.990 --> 00:57:04.320 align:middle line:84%
They're used to feed
you and to protect you.

00:57:04.320 --> 00:57:06.820 align:middle line:84%
Now, we think if someone were
to come in here and attack us,

00:57:06.820 --> 00:57:08.270 align:middle line:90%
we'd fight with our fists.

00:57:08.270 --> 00:57:10.780 align:middle line:84%
Back in the day,
you would bite them.

00:57:10.780 --> 00:57:13.222 align:middle line:10%
So actually, with our
teeth falling out, often we

00:57:13.222 --> 00:57:15.430 align:middle line:10%
have that dream when we're
feeling like we can't feed

00:57:15.430 --> 00:57:19.000 align:middle line:10%
ourselves, money worries, or
we can't protect ourselves,

00:57:19.000 --> 00:57:21.820 align:middle line:10%
relationship worries,
socioeconomic worries.

00:57:21.820 --> 00:57:23.470 align:middle line:84%
Now, if you can get
lucid in a dream

00:57:23.470 --> 00:57:24.910 align:middle line:84%
where your teeth
are falling out,

00:57:24.910 --> 00:57:27.310 align:middle line:90%
you can actually ask the dream--

00:57:27.310 --> 00:57:30.190 align:middle line:84%
what does my teeth
falling out represent?

00:57:30.190 --> 00:57:31.750 align:middle line:90%
And the dream will respond.

00:57:31.750 --> 00:57:34.460 align:middle line:84%
A dream character could
literally walk in and say--

00:57:34.460 --> 00:57:36.610 align:middle line:84%
dude, you've got to get
your finances in order.

00:57:36.610 --> 00:57:37.812 align:middle line:90%
We're struggling here.

00:57:37.812 --> 00:57:38.770 align:middle line:90%
I'm trying to help you.

00:57:38.770 --> 00:57:40.870 align:middle line:84%
But you need to sort
this out in real life.

00:57:40.870 --> 00:57:44.500 align:middle line:84%
And it's amazing what you can
get from the dream if you ask.

00:57:44.500 --> 00:57:46.020 align:middle line:90%
It seems so simple.

00:57:46.020 --> 00:57:48.400 align:middle line:84%
But just two weeks ago,
I was feeling stuck.

00:57:48.400 --> 00:57:50.500 align:middle line:84%
I felt like I had so
many projects that had

00:57:50.500 --> 00:57:51.870 align:middle line:90%
come to an end in this year.

00:57:51.870 --> 00:57:53.610 align:middle line:90%
What was the next big project?

00:57:53.610 --> 00:57:54.410 align:middle line:90%
So I got lucid.

00:57:54.410 --> 00:57:55.840 align:middle line:90%
And I called out to the dream--

00:57:55.840 --> 00:57:58.330 align:middle line:90%
show me what I need to see.

00:57:58.330 --> 00:57:59.890 align:middle line:90%
Not show me what I want to see.

00:57:59.890 --> 00:58:01.500 align:middle line:90%
Show me what I need to see.

00:58:01.500 --> 00:58:04.810 align:middle line:10%
Instantly, the dream transformed
and gave me a very powerful

00:58:04.810 --> 00:58:07.480 align:middle line:10%
indication about continuing
doing the work I've

00:58:07.480 --> 00:58:09.100 align:middle line:10%
been doing with veterans.

00:58:09.100 --> 00:58:11.440 align:middle line:84%
I'm working with veterans,
a lot of who are PTSD

00:58:11.440 --> 00:58:13.750 align:middle line:84%
and the PTSD nightmares
that come with them.

00:58:13.750 --> 00:58:16.000 align:middle line:84%
And this year, I realized
my biggest project this year

00:58:16.000 --> 00:58:17.590 align:middle line:90%
will be work with veterans.

00:58:17.590 --> 00:58:19.120 align:middle line:84%
And the dream is
supportive of that.

00:58:19.120 --> 00:58:21.340 align:middle line:84%
So it's give me
a whole new sense

00:58:21.340 --> 00:58:22.840 align:middle line:84%
of confidence
toward that project

00:58:22.840 --> 00:58:25.270 align:middle line:84%
that I simply didn't have
before that lucid dream.

00:58:25.270 --> 00:58:26.110 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: I love it.

00:58:26.110 --> 00:58:28.930 align:middle line:84%
And you're doing a big
project in America.

00:58:28.930 --> 00:58:32.602 align:middle line:84%
Is it the Veterans
Association, or who is it with?

00:58:32.602 --> 00:58:34.060 align:middle line:84%
>>MORLEY: So the
project in America

00:58:34.060 --> 00:58:37.270 align:middle line:84%
is funded by a UK organization
called the Winston Churchill

00:58:37.270 --> 00:58:39.036 align:middle line:90%
Scholarship Foundation.

00:58:39.036 --> 00:58:40.660 align:middle line:84%
You have to apply
for all these things.

00:58:40.660 --> 00:58:42.770 align:middle line:84%
And they whittle you down to a
short list, super short list.

00:58:42.770 --> 00:58:44.390 align:middle line:84%
Then, you have an
interview process.

00:58:44.390 --> 00:58:46.420 align:middle line:84%
And I got a scholarship
to go to America

00:58:46.420 --> 00:58:50.440 align:middle line:84%
and study best practice
in mindfulness-based PTSD

00:58:50.440 --> 00:58:51.250 align:middle line:90%
treatment.

00:58:51.250 --> 00:58:52.940 align:middle line:84%
So I'll be working with
Bessel van der Kolk.

00:58:52.940 --> 00:58:54.880 align:middle line:84%
He wrote a book called
The Body Keeps the Score.

00:58:54.880 --> 00:58:56.140 align:middle line:84%
I'll be working with
Richard Miller, who

00:58:56.140 --> 00:58:57.765 align:middle line:84%
developed something
called iRest, which

00:58:57.765 --> 00:59:01.690 align:middle line:84%
is a form integrative yoga
nidra especially for trauma

00:59:01.690 --> 00:59:02.560 align:middle line:90%
survivors.

00:59:02.560 --> 00:59:04.210 align:middle line:84%
And then, I'll be
coming back to the UK

00:59:04.210 --> 00:59:08.050 align:middle line:84%
and developing a new workshop
for UK veterans and veterans'

00:59:08.050 --> 00:59:10.180 align:middle line:84%
family members, who are
just as important to work

00:59:10.180 --> 00:59:11.680 align:middle line:90%
with as the veterans themselves.

00:59:11.680 --> 00:59:13.945 align:middle line:84%
How we can use lucid dreaming
and mindfulness of dream

00:59:13.945 --> 00:59:16.900 align:middle line:84%
and sleep to help with
nightmares and PTSD.

00:59:16.900 --> 00:59:18.150 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Good work--

00:59:18.150 --> 00:59:20.390 align:middle line:84%
OK, we just have a
little bit of time.

00:59:20.390 --> 00:59:22.390 align:middle line:84%
So we've already said,
before you go to sleep,

00:59:22.390 --> 00:59:25.000 align:middle line:84%
you need to set the intention
that you want to have

00:59:25.000 --> 00:59:26.370 align:middle line:90%
a dream that you can recognize.

00:59:26.370 --> 00:59:28.840 align:middle line:84%
And you tell yourself
to wake up enough

00:59:28.840 --> 00:59:32.180 align:middle line:84%
at the right time to be able
to record that dream, right?

00:59:32.180 --> 00:59:32.980 align:middle line:90%
>>MORLEY: Yes.

00:59:32.980 --> 00:59:34.030 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Give us
the rest of the list

00:59:34.030 --> 00:59:36.430 align:middle line:84%
and also some supplements
that can help with dreaming.

00:59:36.430 --> 00:59:37.450 align:middle line:90%
>>MORLEY: Brilliant.

00:59:37.450 --> 00:59:40.870 align:middle line:10%
So yeah, those first three
things on the list I'd say--

00:59:40.870 --> 00:59:43.030 align:middle line:10%
set the intention to
remember your dreams.

00:59:43.030 --> 00:59:45.180 align:middle line:10%
Not even lucid dreams,
just normal dreams.

00:59:45.180 --> 00:59:47.560 align:middle line:10%
Then, document your
dreams in some way.

00:59:47.560 --> 00:59:49.390 align:middle line:10%
Write them down.

00:59:49.390 --> 00:59:50.290 align:middle line:90%
Draw them.

00:59:50.290 --> 00:59:51.520 align:middle line:90%
Even dance them.

00:59:51.520 --> 00:59:53.680 align:middle line:84%
Whatever you want to do
to show the dreamer--

00:59:53.680 --> 00:59:54.560 align:middle line:90%
I'm listening.

00:59:54.560 --> 00:59:57.282 align:middle line:84%
After decades of not
listening, I'm now listening.

00:59:57.282 --> 00:59:58.990 align:middle line:84%
People say-- I don't
write down my dreams

00:59:58.990 --> 01:00:00.260 align:middle line:90%
because they're so boring.

01:00:00.260 --> 01:00:02.380 align:middle line:84%
I say-- you have boring dreams
because you don't write them

01:00:02.380 --> 01:00:03.090 align:middle line:90%
down.

01:00:03.090 --> 01:00:05.048 align:middle line:84%
You need to let the
dreamer know I'm listening.

01:00:05.048 --> 01:00:06.670 align:middle line:84%
So we document our
dreams in some way.

01:00:06.670 --> 01:00:09.330 align:middle line:84%
We use our dream diaries
to spot these patterns.

01:00:09.330 --> 01:00:12.200 align:middle line:84%
Then, we set triggers that the
next time I see what I often

01:00:12.200 --> 01:00:13.060 align:middle line:90%
dream about--

01:00:13.060 --> 01:00:15.460 align:middle line:84%
my dead grandmother or
talking baby animals--

01:00:15.460 --> 01:00:17.260 align:middle line:90%
I will know that I'm dreaming.

01:00:17.260 --> 01:00:19.990 align:middle line:84%
These are our first three
steps towards lucidity.

01:00:19.990 --> 01:00:21.820 align:middle line:84%
Another thing you
can do-- very simple.

01:00:21.820 --> 01:00:25.185 align:middle line:84%
As you fall asleep tonight, in
the second half of the night

01:00:25.185 --> 01:00:27.310 align:middle line:84%
if possible-- so if you
wake up to pee in the night

01:00:27.310 --> 01:00:28.510 align:middle line:90%
or something like that.

01:00:28.510 --> 01:00:31.030 align:middle line:84%
More likely to have your longer
dreams in the second half.

01:00:31.030 --> 01:00:33.820 align:middle line:84%
As you're falling back asleep
in the second half of the night,

01:00:33.820 --> 01:00:36.360 align:middle line:84%
just be reciting over
and over in your mind--

01:00:36.360 --> 01:00:39.080 align:middle line:90%
tonight I recognize my dreams.

01:00:39.080 --> 01:00:41.490 align:middle line:90%
Tonight I'm lucid in my dreams.

01:00:41.490 --> 01:00:44.210 align:middle line:10%
Tonight I recognize my dreams.

01:00:44.210 --> 01:00:46.784 align:middle line:10%
Tonight I am lucid in my dreams.

01:00:46.784 --> 01:00:48.700 align:middle line:84%
When we fall asleep, we
pass through something

01:00:48.700 --> 01:00:50.689 align:middle line:90%
called the hypnogogic state.

01:00:50.689 --> 01:00:52.480 align:middle line:84%
Which, if we see from
the root of the word,

01:00:52.480 --> 01:00:54.190 align:middle line:90%
it's close to hypnosis.

01:00:54.190 --> 01:00:56.230 align:middle line:84%
It's a natural
state of hypnosis.

01:00:56.230 --> 01:00:58.120 align:middle line:84%
So if as we pass
through that, we

01:00:58.120 --> 01:01:02.200 align:middle line:84%
engage the hypnotic suggestion
to become lucid in our dreams,

01:01:02.200 --> 01:01:05.170 align:middle line:84%
we engage a very powerful
intention that may well

01:01:05.170 --> 01:01:06.810 align:middle line:90%
help us get lucid tonight.

01:01:06.810 --> 01:01:08.050 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: I love it.

01:01:08.050 --> 01:01:10.190 align:middle line:84%
It's been an absolutely
delightful conversation.

01:01:10.190 --> 01:01:10.990 align:middle line:90%
Thank you.

01:01:10.990 --> 01:01:12.948 align:middle line:84%
One final thing-- what
are the supplements that

01:01:12.948 --> 01:01:15.760 align:middle line:84%
often help with going into
dream time a little more easily?

01:01:15.760 --> 01:01:16.605 align:middle line:90%
>>MORLEY: Vitamin supplements?

01:01:16.605 --> 01:01:17.405 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

01:01:17.405 --> 01:01:19.266 align:middle line:10%
>>MORLEY: OK, the only
natural supplements

01:01:19.266 --> 01:01:20.640 align:middle line:10%
that I could advise
people to try

01:01:20.640 --> 01:01:24.430 align:middle line:10%
are things with high
B vitamin content.

01:01:24.430 --> 01:01:27.190 align:middle line:84%
If you can get it naturally
through things like spirulina,

01:01:27.190 --> 01:01:30.700 align:middle line:84%
kale which is super trendy now,
spinach, anything dark, green,

01:01:30.700 --> 01:01:33.040 align:middle line:84%
leafy vegetables--
loads of B vitamins.

01:01:33.040 --> 01:01:35.020 align:middle line:84%
If you haven't quite
got that in your diet,

01:01:35.020 --> 01:01:37.840 align:middle line:84%
then if you were to have a
little B vitamin supplement you

01:01:37.840 --> 01:01:41.080 align:middle line:84%
can buy from a pharmacy
after a few hours of sleep,

01:01:41.080 --> 01:01:42.640 align:middle line:90%
it won't do you any harm.

01:01:42.640 --> 01:01:43.720 align:middle line:90%
It will be good for you.

01:01:43.720 --> 01:01:46.355 align:middle line:84%
And it will give you longer
REM periods, dream periods,

01:01:46.355 --> 01:01:47.980 align:middle line:84%
in which you can
recognize your dreams.

01:01:47.980 --> 01:01:49.519 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Very
good-- thank you so

01:01:49.519 --> 01:01:50.810 align:middle line:90%
much for the how-to part of it.

01:01:50.810 --> 01:01:52.592 align:middle line:84%
And thank you for the
entire conversation.

01:01:52.592 --> 01:01:53.800 align:middle line:90%
It was absolutely delightful.

01:01:53.800 --> 01:01:54.220 align:middle line:90%
>>MORLEY: Thank you.

01:01:54.220 --> 01:01:55.094 align:middle line:90%
It's been a pleasure.

01:01:55.094 --> 01:01:58.480 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And thank you for
driving to join us here.

01:01:58.480 --> 01:02:00.610 align:middle line:10%
Since everyone loves
the subject of dreams,

01:02:00.610 --> 01:02:03.160 align:middle line:10%
you might want to pick up
a copy of "Lucid Dreaming"

01:02:03.160 --> 01:02:05.140 align:middle line:10%
available at all
major booksellers.

01:02:05.140 --> 01:02:07.180 align:middle line:10%
Until next time, thank
you for joining us here

01:02:07.180 --> 01:02:09.070 align:middle line:10%
in London for "Open Minds."
