00:00:27.396 --> 00:00:28.770 align:middle line:10%
>>REGINA MEREDITH:
For years now,

00:00:28.770 --> 00:00:30.620 align:middle line:10%
we've been told of
an impending crash

00:00:30.620 --> 00:00:32.240 align:middle line:10%
in our economic structure.

00:00:32.240 --> 00:00:35.270 align:middle line:10%
But here we are, living our
lives as we always have.

00:00:35.270 --> 00:00:36.200 align:middle line:90%
Or are we?

00:00:36.200 --> 00:00:38.870 align:middle line:84%
Andy Hoffman is with
us today to tell us,

00:00:38.870 --> 00:00:41.990 align:middle line:84%
if we look a little bit closer,
it's not all as it appears.

00:00:41.990 --> 00:00:44.084 align:middle line:84%
And big changes
still lie in waiting.

00:00:44.084 --> 00:00:45.750 align:middle line:84%
And I think that's
what most people want

00:00:45.750 --> 00:00:47.070 align:middle line:90%
to know about in this.

00:00:47.070 --> 00:00:49.620 align:middle line:84%
Because there's been so much
crying wolf through the years,

00:00:49.620 --> 00:00:52.600 align:middle line:84%
when 2008 happened it's
like, surely there's

00:00:52.600 --> 00:00:55.480 align:middle line:84%
going to be a major
economic shift.

00:00:55.480 --> 00:00:56.420 align:middle line:90%
Well, there was.

00:00:56.420 --> 00:00:59.770 align:middle line:84%
But for the average person, if
you're not in tremendous pain,

00:00:59.770 --> 00:01:02.690 align:middle line:84%
it doesn't look like
that much happened.

00:01:02.690 --> 00:01:05.220 align:middle line:84%
Quantitative easing
started to kind of put

00:01:05.220 --> 00:01:07.229 align:middle line:84%
some gum in the holes
for a little while.

00:01:07.229 --> 00:01:08.770 align:middle line:84%
And we're going to
get into all that.

00:01:08.770 --> 00:01:10.890 align:middle line:84%
So first of all,
what I've noticed

00:01:10.890 --> 00:01:13.380 align:middle line:84%
and I continue to notice--
we talked about this a couple

00:01:13.380 --> 00:01:14.440 align:middle line:90%
times.

00:01:14.440 --> 00:01:19.760 align:middle line:84%
As the years go on, the aisles
in the stores become wider,

00:01:19.760 --> 00:01:24.650 align:middle line:84%
and the inventory becomes less
varied and less, in general.

00:01:24.650 --> 00:01:27.270 align:middle line:84%
So I'm seeing as a consumer,
when you go places,

00:01:27.270 --> 00:01:29.770 align:middle line:84%
there's just less of
everything out there.

00:01:29.770 --> 00:01:32.942 align:middle line:84%
So what is that indicating,
because that's in the streets?

00:01:32.942 --> 00:01:34.900 align:middle line:10%
>>ANDY HOFFMAN: Well,
essentially, from the way

00:01:34.900 --> 00:01:38.455 align:middle line:10%
you started, the people
in charge in Washington

00:01:38.455 --> 00:01:41.340 align:middle line:10%
and on Wall Street
and even in the media

00:01:41.340 --> 00:01:44.210 align:middle line:10%
will want you to believe
that 2008 was somehow

00:01:44.210 --> 00:01:47.840 align:middle line:10%
the end of a bad thing and
that we're in a new beginning.

00:01:47.840 --> 00:01:50.370 align:middle line:10%
But actually it was the
beginning of the bad thing.

00:01:50.370 --> 00:01:53.250 align:middle line:84%
And as you said, as the
time has passed, yes,

00:01:53.250 --> 00:01:57.220 align:middle line:84%
2009-'10 there was all the chaos
and the stock market going back

00:01:57.220 --> 00:02:00.250 align:middle line:84%
up and everyone trying to
figure out if things were fixed.

00:02:00.250 --> 00:02:01.940 align:middle line:84%
But as time passes,
you look at what's

00:02:01.940 --> 00:02:04.610 align:middle line:84%
really going on, not just
here, but throughout the world.

00:02:04.610 --> 00:02:07.310 align:middle line:84%
And you realize
that not only was

00:02:07.310 --> 00:02:10.180 align:middle line:84%
the sickness something
that's chronic,

00:02:10.180 --> 00:02:11.670 align:middle line:90%
but it's getting worse.

00:02:11.670 --> 00:02:14.840 align:middle line:84%
And if you talk literally
about the stores,

00:02:14.840 --> 00:02:18.781 align:middle line:84%
yes, they're becoming emptier,
because people have less money

00:02:18.781 --> 00:02:19.280 align:middle line:90%
to spend.

00:02:19.280 --> 00:02:21.520 align:middle line:84%
They have more debt
than they've ever had,

00:02:21.520 --> 00:02:26.020 align:middle line:84%
partly because of just a secular
decline in the global economy,

00:02:26.020 --> 00:02:28.880 align:middle line:84%
but more so because of all
the money printing that's

00:02:28.880 --> 00:02:31.530 align:middle line:90%
been going on for four decades.

00:02:31.530 --> 00:02:35.080 align:middle line:84%
The lifespan of this Ponzi
scheme is reaching its end.

00:02:35.080 --> 00:02:37.070 align:middle line:84%
And what happens at the
end of a Ponzi scheme?

00:02:37.070 --> 00:02:39.050 align:middle line:84%
You try to expand it
even greater, which

00:02:39.050 --> 00:02:42.520 align:middle line:84%
is why you're seeing such
incredible disparities

00:02:42.520 --> 00:02:45.700 align:middle line:84%
between, for instance,
financial markets and reality

00:02:45.700 --> 00:02:48.665 align:middle line:84%
or even economic
statistics and reality.

00:02:48.665 --> 00:02:49.680 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Truly.

00:02:49.680 --> 00:02:53.230 align:middle line:84%
And just on the
consumer front again,

00:02:53.230 --> 00:02:56.190 align:middle line:84%
the companies seem to be
trying every which way to get

00:02:56.190 --> 00:02:58.120 align:middle line:90%
$1 from the consumer.

00:02:58.120 --> 00:02:59.220 align:middle line:90%
Everything's on sale.

00:02:59.220 --> 00:03:02.517 align:middle line:84%
OK, we're extending that
sale another month or a day.

00:03:02.517 --> 00:03:04.100 align:middle line:84%
And then it goes
deeper, the next one.

00:03:04.100 --> 00:03:07.330 align:middle line:84%
How are companies
staying alive at all?

00:03:07.330 --> 00:03:08.010 align:middle line:90%
I don't get it.

00:03:08.010 --> 00:03:11.800 align:middle line:84%
How can you have perpetual
40% off sales now,

00:03:11.800 --> 00:03:13.690 align:middle line:84%
which use to be a rare
thing-- Black Friday?

00:03:13.690 --> 00:03:15.210 align:middle line:90%
Now it's every day practically.

00:03:15.210 --> 00:03:17.506 align:middle line:84%
How can you have that and,
as a company, stay alive?

00:03:17.506 --> 00:03:19.130 align:middle line:84%
>>HOFFMAN: Well, for
smaller companies,

00:03:19.130 --> 00:03:22.030 align:middle line:90%
they're not staying alive.

00:03:22.030 --> 00:03:25.010 align:middle line:84%
The job decline rate, or
people going out to business,

00:03:25.010 --> 00:03:28.180 align:middle line:84%
is at a high that we
haven't seen in decades,

00:03:28.180 --> 00:03:31.280 align:middle line:84%
while the job formation
rate is at a record low.

00:03:31.280 --> 00:03:33.920 align:middle line:84%
That's why it's so funny
when the government puts out,

00:03:33.920 --> 00:03:36.570 align:middle line:84%
in their monthly
unemployment report,

00:03:36.570 --> 00:03:38.650 align:middle line:84%
this thing called the
Birth-Death Model,

00:03:38.650 --> 00:03:41.910 align:middle line:84%
which supposedly says, these are
jobs that were created or not

00:03:41.910 --> 00:03:45.384 align:middle line:84%
created, that have to do with
companies going out of business

00:03:45.384 --> 00:03:46.425 align:middle line:90%
that we don't know about.

00:03:46.425 --> 00:03:50.780 align:middle line:84%
But the fact is you can have
a net positive Birth-Death

00:03:50.780 --> 00:03:53.280 align:middle line:84%
increase in jobs, because more
companies have been going out

00:03:53.280 --> 00:03:55.500 align:middle line:84%
of business than
being started up.

00:03:55.500 --> 00:03:58.740 align:middle line:84%
And look, the big companies
are supported by Wall Street.

00:03:58.740 --> 00:04:00.480 align:middle line:84%
They're supported by
record low interest

00:04:00.480 --> 00:04:03.550 align:middle line:84%
rates that have caused them
to do very, very dumb things,

00:04:03.550 --> 00:04:05.690 align:middle line:84%
like borrow money to
buy back their stock.

00:04:05.690 --> 00:04:08.660 align:middle line:84%
IBM is a perfect example,
while their core business

00:04:08.660 --> 00:04:09.760 align:middle line:90%
is going down.

00:04:09.760 --> 00:04:14.550 align:middle line:84%
And then, of course, you have
the big titans-- the Coca

00:04:14.550 --> 00:04:17.310 align:middle line:84%
Colas, the Walmarts,
the McDonald's that

00:04:17.310 --> 00:04:20.410 align:middle line:90%
are just simply doing badly.

00:04:20.410 --> 00:04:22.700 align:middle line:84%
They're doing as
badly as they can do.

00:04:22.700 --> 00:04:25.230 align:middle line:84%
I wrote an article, about
three or four months ago,

00:04:25.230 --> 00:04:28.490 align:middle line:84%
called "Need or Want,
Demand is Dying."

00:04:28.490 --> 00:04:31.410 align:middle line:84%
And the point is that for
companies that sell things

00:04:31.410 --> 00:04:34.550 align:middle line:84%
that you need, such as
McDonald's or Walmart,

00:04:34.550 --> 00:04:36.016 align:middle line:84%
their business is
doing terrible.

00:04:36.016 --> 00:04:37.640 align:middle line:84%
But then you look at
the companies that

00:04:37.640 --> 00:04:40.450 align:middle line:84%
are purely discretionary
income, that you

00:04:40.450 --> 00:04:43.249 align:middle line:84%
spend with-- Amazon.com,
eBay, perfect examples

00:04:43.249 --> 00:04:44.040 align:middle line:90%
of these companies.

00:04:44.040 --> 00:04:47.650 align:middle line:84%
Even Netflix recently, their
business is going bad too.

00:04:47.650 --> 00:04:50.974 align:middle line:84%
The point is-- it's not just
things that you want to buy.

00:04:50.974 --> 00:04:52.390 align:middle line:84%
It's things that
you need as well.

00:04:52.390 --> 00:04:56.220 align:middle line:84%
So while Wall Street is
trying to support them,

00:04:56.220 --> 00:04:58.786 align:middle line:84%
their core business
keeps getting worse.

00:04:58.786 --> 00:05:00.520 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: What about beer?

00:05:00.520 --> 00:05:02.280 align:middle line:84%
I thought beer
always did well in

00:05:02.280 --> 00:05:04.270 align:middle line:90%
extreme financial environments.

00:05:04.270 --> 00:05:04.937 align:middle line:90%
>>HOFFMAN: Bear?

00:05:04.937 --> 00:05:05.561 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Beer.

00:05:05.561 --> 00:05:06.530 align:middle line:90%
>>HOFFMAN: Oh, beer.

00:05:06.530 --> 00:05:08.738 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: I thought that
was one of those things that

00:05:08.738 --> 00:05:10.730 align:middle line:90%
was recession-proof-- beer.

00:05:10.730 --> 00:05:11.955 align:middle line:90%
Any news on the beer market?

00:05:11.955 --> 00:05:15.100 align:middle line:84%
>>HOFFMAN: Well, I'm not even
sure how beer sales have done.

00:05:15.100 --> 00:05:17.650 align:middle line:90%
I don't think they change much.

00:05:17.650 --> 00:05:20.184 align:middle line:84%
But the prices are
certainly going down.

00:05:20.184 --> 00:05:22.350 align:middle line:84%
And you know, I can tell
you a business which is not

00:05:22.350 --> 00:05:24.180 align:middle line:84%
doing well, which
is wine, which is

00:05:24.180 --> 00:05:26.630 align:middle line:84%
why you get all these
wine offers now,

00:05:26.630 --> 00:05:28.130 align:middle line:90%
all these wine clubs.

00:05:28.130 --> 00:05:30.270 align:middle line:84%
Because the wine--
it's just not a world

00:05:30.270 --> 00:05:32.400 align:middle line:84%
where people can afford,
the average person,

00:05:32.400 --> 00:05:35.330 align:middle line:84%
to spend more than a
small amount on wine.

00:05:35.330 --> 00:05:36.980 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:05:36.980 --> 00:05:38.466 align:middle line:84%
On the plane in
here yesterday, I

00:05:38.466 --> 00:05:40.090 align:middle line:84%
was sitting next to
a wine distributor,

00:05:40.090 --> 00:05:42.298 align:middle line:84%
as a matter of fact, And I
was asking him about that.

00:05:42.298 --> 00:05:44.770 align:middle line:84%
And he said, the industry
took such a beating.

00:05:44.770 --> 00:05:49.210 align:middle line:84%
But they've just seen an
uptick, just in 2014, and maybe

00:05:49.210 --> 00:05:52.680 align:middle line:84%
because he's dealing with
more high-end retailers.

00:05:52.680 --> 00:05:55.510 align:middle line:84%
>>HOFFMAN: Well, that's the next
thing that, obviously, we're

00:05:55.510 --> 00:05:57.250 align:middle line:90%
going to get to down your list.

00:05:57.250 --> 00:06:00.760 align:middle line:84%
The wealth inequality that's
been caused by all this money

00:06:00.760 --> 00:06:02.850 align:middle line:90%
printing gets wider each day.

00:06:02.850 --> 00:06:05.440 align:middle line:84%
All the money from
2008, or even going

00:06:05.440 --> 00:06:08.340 align:middle line:84%
back to the Greenspan
days, has gone

00:06:08.340 --> 00:06:12.710 align:middle line:84%
into the hands of Wall Street
and corporate lobbyists, et

00:06:12.710 --> 00:06:13.380 align:middle line:90%
cetera.

00:06:13.380 --> 00:06:17.170 align:middle line:84%
And more and more, you see the
average person doing poorly,

00:06:17.170 --> 00:06:21.310 align:middle line:84%
while the average
1% gets richer.

00:06:21.310 --> 00:06:23.060 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And the story
is just deepening.

00:06:23.060 --> 00:06:24.370 align:middle line:90%
It's not like it's new.

00:06:24.370 --> 00:06:27.120 align:middle line:84%
OK, we're doing this
on election day.

00:06:27.120 --> 00:06:29.340 align:middle line:84%
And a lot of times,
an election can

00:06:29.340 --> 00:06:32.740 align:middle line:84%
have an effect on the
artificial markets that exist.

00:06:32.740 --> 00:06:36.830 align:middle line:84%
But truth be known, in
your opinion, people go

00:06:36.830 --> 00:06:38.020 align:middle line:90%
and say, oh, this economy.

00:06:38.020 --> 00:06:39.780 align:middle line:84%
Obama has trashed
it, not stopping

00:06:39.780 --> 00:06:41.750 align:middle line:84%
to look back to what
he inherited from Bush,

00:06:41.750 --> 00:06:43.210 align:middle line:90%
and so on and so on.

00:06:43.210 --> 00:06:48.730 align:middle line:84%
So what is your
feeling about the way

00:06:48.730 --> 00:06:51.540 align:middle line:84%
the country is
structured politically

00:06:51.540 --> 00:06:52.810 align:middle line:90%
and the system we have now?

00:06:52.810 --> 00:06:54.380 align:middle line:84%
Does it matter, at
all, whether you

00:06:54.380 --> 00:06:56.030 align:middle line:90%
have Democrats or Republicans?

00:06:56.030 --> 00:06:57.540 align:middle line:90%
>>HOFFMAN: It's really sad.

00:06:57.540 --> 00:07:00.690 align:middle line:84%
When you think
about two years ago,

00:07:00.690 --> 00:07:03.930 align:middle line:84%
with the presidential
election, how much-- it

00:07:03.930 --> 00:07:05.200 align:middle line:90%
was how important it was.

00:07:05.200 --> 00:07:09.030 align:middle line:84%
Will the Senate go to the
Democrats or Republicans?

00:07:09.030 --> 00:07:10.432 align:middle line:90%
And it was such a big deal.

00:07:10.432 --> 00:07:12.140 align:middle line:84%
And what will happen
in the fiscal cliff?

00:07:12.140 --> 00:07:15.000 align:middle line:84%
And holy cow, it's such a
nail-biter to the last minute.

00:07:15.000 --> 00:07:18.110 align:middle line:84%
And here we are, two years
later, the average person

00:07:18.110 --> 00:07:19.540 align:middle line:90%
is doing far worse.

00:07:19.540 --> 00:07:21.857 align:middle line:84%
The country-- the world
is doing far worse.

00:07:21.857 --> 00:07:23.690 align:middle line:84%
And there isn't even a
presidential election

00:07:23.690 --> 00:07:24.520 align:middle line:90%
to distract us.

00:07:24.520 --> 00:07:28.390 align:middle line:84%
And yet, no one has any
idea who's even running.

00:07:28.390 --> 00:07:31.230 align:middle line:84%
No one is talking about, on
the mainstream news-- will

00:07:31.230 --> 00:07:32.760 align:middle line:90%
the Democrats lose the Senate?

00:07:32.760 --> 00:07:35.747 align:middle line:84%
Maybe today, like
literally, this very morning

00:07:35.747 --> 00:07:36.830 align:middle line:90%
there's a couple of races.

00:07:36.830 --> 00:07:38.330 align:middle line:90%
But I don't think people care.

00:07:38.330 --> 00:07:40.890 align:middle line:84%
I wrote something--
you think back

00:07:40.890 --> 00:07:45.666 align:middle line:84%
to what James Carville said,
10 or 15 years ago, when

00:07:45.666 --> 00:07:46.790 align:middle line:90%
he was working for Clinton.

00:07:46.790 --> 00:07:48.420 align:middle line:84%
He said, it's the
economy, stupid.

00:07:48.420 --> 00:07:49.540 align:middle line:90%
That's how you vote.

00:07:49.540 --> 00:07:50.730 align:middle line:90%
The economy is doing bad.

00:07:50.730 --> 00:07:52.150 align:middle line:90%
George Bush wasn't doing well.

00:07:52.150 --> 00:07:53.490 align:middle line:90%
Well, you vote in Clinton.

00:07:53.490 --> 00:07:55.480 align:middle line:84%
And I wrote a piece last
year called, "It's not

00:07:55.480 --> 00:07:58.760 align:middle line:84%
the Economy, Stupid," because
no longer do people vote

00:07:58.760 --> 00:08:00.460 align:middle line:90%
because things are doing bad.

00:08:00.460 --> 00:08:03.580 align:middle line:84%
They just go to who promises
the most entitlements.

00:08:03.580 --> 00:08:06.300 align:middle line:84%
And at this point, it
doesn't even matter,

00:08:06.300 --> 00:08:08.160 align:middle line:84%
because now the
Republicans realize

00:08:08.160 --> 00:08:10.640 align:middle line:84%
there are so many poor people
that they can no longer be

00:08:10.640 --> 00:08:11.670 align:middle line:90%
the party of the rich.

00:08:11.670 --> 00:08:14.640 align:middle line:84%
So they just do whatever
the Democrats do.

00:08:14.640 --> 00:08:17.080 align:middle line:84%
Plus, the President
now has so much power

00:08:17.080 --> 00:08:18.610 align:middle line:90%
to do whatever he wants.

00:08:18.610 --> 00:08:20.110 align:middle line:84%
Remember, just a
year ago, they were

00:08:20.110 --> 00:08:22.330 align:middle line:84%
arguing about the fiscal
cliff and the debt ceiling

00:08:22.330 --> 00:08:23.079 align:middle line:90%
and this and that.

00:08:23.079 --> 00:08:24.030 align:middle line:90%
They don't even argue.

00:08:24.030 --> 00:08:24.946 align:middle line:90%
Remember John Boehner.

00:08:24.946 --> 00:08:26.290 align:middle line:90%
He was so angry.

00:08:26.290 --> 00:08:27.410 align:middle line:90%
Where is he?

00:08:27.410 --> 00:08:28.590 align:middle line:90%
They don't even argue.

00:08:28.590 --> 00:08:31.180 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Because actually, it
sounds like it's a little too

00:08:31.180 --> 00:08:32.586 align:middle line:90%
hopeless, in that sense.

00:08:32.586 --> 00:08:34.669 align:middle line:84%
>>HOFFMAN: Yeah, they're
going to print the money.

00:08:34.669 --> 00:08:36.044 align:middle line:84%
They're going to
spend the money.

00:08:36.044 --> 00:08:39.100 align:middle line:84%
And that's why they order
the Federal Reserve to keep

00:08:39.100 --> 00:08:40.630 align:middle line:90%
interest rates at zero forever.

00:08:40.630 --> 00:08:42.080 align:middle line:84%
We have the greatest
debt edifice

00:08:42.080 --> 00:08:44.580 align:middle line:84%
in history, the greatest
deficits in history.

00:08:44.580 --> 00:08:47.220 align:middle line:84%
All those trends are
only going to get worse.

00:08:47.220 --> 00:08:51.270 align:middle line:84%
And therefore, when they talk
about the end of QE, which they

00:08:51.270 --> 00:08:53.479 align:middle line:90%
really didn't even end it.

00:08:53.479 --> 00:08:54.020 align:middle line:90%
It's comical.

00:08:54.020 --> 00:08:54.340 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: OK.

00:08:54.340 --> 00:08:55.840 align:middle line:84%
Well, that's where
we're going next.

00:08:55.840 --> 00:08:58.590 align:middle line:84%
By the way, what's happened
since we last spoke?

00:08:58.590 --> 00:09:01.860 align:middle line:84%
If you're a consumer, if you
could even qualify for a loan

00:09:01.860 --> 00:09:04.560 align:middle line:84%
anymore, what's happened with
interest rates on the housing

00:09:04.560 --> 00:09:05.770 align:middle line:90%
market?

00:09:05.770 --> 00:09:08.340 align:middle line:84%
>>HOFFMAN: Well, interest
rates, they're not record low,

00:09:08.340 --> 00:09:10.237 align:middle line:84%
but they're pretty
close to the record low.

00:09:10.237 --> 00:09:12.320 align:middle line:84%
But it's immaterial, at
some point, when something

00:09:12.320 --> 00:09:15.660 align:middle line:84%
is so low, whether interest
rate is 3%, 3 and 1/2%, 4%,

00:09:15.660 --> 00:09:16.670 align:middle line:90%
it doesn't matter.

00:09:16.670 --> 00:09:19.930 align:middle line:84%
The fact is, it's harder than
ever to get a mortgage loan.

00:09:19.930 --> 00:09:22.800 align:middle line:84%
But more importantly,
the banks aren't lending.

00:09:22.800 --> 00:09:24.260 align:middle line:84%
They just take all
that free money

00:09:24.260 --> 00:09:25.760 align:middle line:84%
that they get from
the Fed, and they

00:09:25.760 --> 00:09:28.920 align:middle line:84%
park it right back at the Fed
to get free interest rates.

00:09:28.920 --> 00:09:34.150 align:middle line:84%
And as far as a home ownership,
mortgage purchase applications

00:09:34.150 --> 00:09:35.390 align:middle line:90%
are at a 20-year low.

00:09:35.390 --> 00:09:38.490 align:middle line:84%
And in fact, this whole
hype about the housing

00:09:38.490 --> 00:09:40.660 align:middle line:84%
boom, the echo
bubble, that we had

00:09:40.660 --> 00:09:42.905 align:middle line:84%
in the last couple
of years, it was only

00:09:42.905 --> 00:09:43.905 align:middle line:90%
in the high-end markets.

00:09:43.905 --> 00:09:47.450 align:middle line:84%
It was only in above
the $1 million houses.

00:09:47.450 --> 00:09:49.440 align:middle line:84%
Yes, for a brief
little period of time,

00:09:49.440 --> 00:09:51.602 align:middle line:84%
the middle of the market
had a little boost.

00:09:51.602 --> 00:09:53.810 align:middle line:84%
But it's really only been
the high end of the market.

00:09:53.810 --> 00:09:56.040 align:middle line:84%
Everyone else has seen
their houses go nowhere.

00:09:56.040 --> 00:09:58.280 align:middle line:84%
And now the houses-- the
prices are going down.

00:09:58.280 --> 00:10:02.510 align:middle line:84%
But more importantly, the
average person is not buying.

00:10:02.510 --> 00:10:04.590 align:middle line:84%
The average person isn't
even trying anymore,

00:10:04.590 --> 00:10:07.450 align:middle line:84%
because they're saddled
down with all this debt,

00:10:07.450 --> 00:10:10.410 align:middle line:84%
with all these student
loans going on.

00:10:10.410 --> 00:10:12.000 align:middle line:90%
There's no jobs out there.

00:10:12.000 --> 00:10:14.850 align:middle line:84%
The jobs that are there now--
even the government admits,

00:10:14.850 --> 00:10:17.160 align:middle line:84%
when they put out their
unemployment reports, that they

00:10:17.160 --> 00:10:19.491 align:middle line:84%
hype and say, oh, the
numbers are so good.

00:10:19.491 --> 00:10:20.490 align:middle line:90%
You look at the numbers.

00:10:20.490 --> 00:10:21.910 align:middle line:90%
They're all part-time jobs.

00:10:21.910 --> 00:10:23.360 align:middle line:90%
They're minimum wage jobs.

00:10:23.360 --> 00:10:26.470 align:middle line:84%
They don't pay benefits
now because of Obamacare.

00:10:26.470 --> 00:10:28.120 align:middle line:84%
The companies are
doing everything they

00:10:28.120 --> 00:10:29.695 align:middle line:90%
can to not give you benefits.

00:10:29.695 --> 00:10:32.200 align:middle line:90%


00:10:32.200 --> 00:10:35.340 align:middle line:84%
The last time I had
company-paid health insurance

00:10:35.340 --> 00:10:37.340 align:middle line:84%
was when I worked
on Wall Street.

00:10:37.340 --> 00:10:39.310 align:middle line:90%
That was almost 10 years ago.

00:10:39.310 --> 00:10:42.290 align:middle line:84%
I call it the mythical
unicorn now, health insurance,

00:10:42.290 --> 00:10:44.930 align:middle line:84%
because it's so rare to find a
company that pays it anymore.

00:10:44.930 --> 00:10:47.000 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: What's
happening with that?

00:10:47.000 --> 00:10:50.510 align:middle line:84%
Some article I read recently
was talking about how now we're

00:10:50.510 --> 00:10:53.070 align:middle line:84%
going to start seeing steep
rises in the price of health

00:10:53.070 --> 00:10:54.100 align:middle line:90%
care under Obamacare.

00:10:54.100 --> 00:10:55.558 align:middle line:84%
>>HOFFMAN: Well,
we're going to see

00:10:55.558 --> 00:10:58.290 align:middle line:84%
steep rises in the prices of
health care for many reasons.

00:10:58.290 --> 00:11:00.430 align:middle line:84%
Mostly, you start with
the money printing.

00:11:00.430 --> 00:11:02.870 align:middle line:84%
Then you look at the
demographics, and of course,

00:11:02.870 --> 00:11:04.500 align:middle line:84%
the litigious
society that's made

00:11:04.500 --> 00:11:08.390 align:middle line:84%
it so expensive to go to
school and to become a doctor.

00:11:08.390 --> 00:11:12.325 align:middle line:84%
But Obamacare is
just-- it's socialism.

00:11:12.325 --> 00:11:13.580 align:middle line:90%
A, it doesn't work.

00:11:13.580 --> 00:11:15.580 align:middle line:84%
And B, it just makes
the costs go higher.

00:11:15.580 --> 00:11:20.910 align:middle line:84%
In fact, I think it's pretty
funny that the 2015 price

00:11:20.910 --> 00:11:23.160 align:middle line:84%
changes for Obamacare, which
were supposed to come out

00:11:23.160 --> 00:11:26.020 align:middle line:84%
last month, were suddenly
delayed until next week,

00:11:26.020 --> 00:11:26.870 align:middle line:90%
after the elections.

00:11:26.870 --> 00:11:27.690 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:11:27.690 --> 00:11:31.840 align:middle line:84%
>>HOFFMAN: But look, my health
care, my health insurance--

00:11:31.840 --> 00:11:35.170 align:middle line:84%
and I've been healthy-- has
gone up 15% a year for as long

00:11:35.170 --> 00:11:35.920 align:middle line:90%
as I can remember.

00:11:35.920 --> 00:11:38.130 align:middle line:90%
And that's before Obamacare.

00:11:38.130 --> 00:11:41.040 align:middle line:84%
And again, the thing that
I can't emphasize enough

00:11:41.040 --> 00:11:44.970 align:middle line:84%
is, because of the
state of our economy

00:11:44.970 --> 00:11:48.020 align:middle line:84%
and our financial
situation, we are clearly

00:11:48.020 --> 00:11:50.510 align:middle line:90%
going to be fully socialist.

00:11:50.510 --> 00:11:53.040 align:middle line:84%
We have to, or else
everyone starves.

00:11:53.040 --> 00:11:55.980 align:middle line:84%
So people need to get
ready for tax rates

00:11:55.980 --> 00:11:57.480 align:middle line:84%
like they have in
Europe and Canada.

00:11:57.480 --> 00:11:59.306 align:middle line:90%
I mean, it is coming here.

00:11:59.306 --> 00:12:01.700 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: OK, let's
talk about-- we

00:12:01.700 --> 00:12:04.300 align:middle line:84%
started to go there a moment
ago-- quantitative easing.

00:12:04.300 --> 00:12:07.100 align:middle line:10%
So we've been through the
first three phases of it.

00:12:07.100 --> 00:12:12.210 align:middle line:10%
And supposedly, it was too
have ended last Friday.

00:12:12.210 --> 00:12:15.480 align:middle line:84%
What day was that,
maybe the 30th?

00:12:15.480 --> 00:12:17.730 align:middle line:84%
People will be seeing this
a little bit in the future.

00:12:17.730 --> 00:12:20.835 align:middle line:84%
So that would've been, I
think, October 30 or so, it

00:12:20.835 --> 00:12:22.841 align:middle line:90%
was supposed to have ended.

00:12:22.841 --> 00:12:23.860 align:middle line:90%
>>HOFFMAN: Did it?

00:12:23.860 --> 00:12:24.360 align:middle line:90%
No.

00:12:24.360 --> 00:12:25.850 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: That's
what I'm asking you.

00:12:25.850 --> 00:12:27.266 align:middle line:84%
And everyone is
like, what's going

00:12:27.266 --> 00:12:29.000 align:middle line:90%
to happen to the stock markets?

00:12:29.000 --> 00:12:29.740 align:middle line:90%
Talk about this.

00:12:29.740 --> 00:12:30.795 align:middle line:90%
What actually happened?

00:12:30.795 --> 00:12:34.170 align:middle line:84%
>>HOFFMAN: Well, first
of all, when you go back

00:12:34.170 --> 00:12:38.696 align:middle line:84%
to 2008 and the
emergency response,

00:12:38.696 --> 00:12:40.320 align:middle line:84%
I've been in the
markets my whole life.

00:12:40.320 --> 00:12:43.610 align:middle line:84%
It was very clear that the--
let's call it the powers

00:12:43.610 --> 00:12:44.110 align:middle line:90%
that be.

00:12:44.110 --> 00:12:46.350 align:middle line:84%
The Federal Reserve, the
banks, the politicians,

00:12:46.350 --> 00:12:47.950 align:middle line:90%
they were taken by surprise.

00:12:47.950 --> 00:12:50.749 align:middle line:84%
They didn't realize, even
after what happened in 2000,

00:12:50.749 --> 00:12:52.540 align:middle line:84%
they didn't realize
that this could happen.

00:12:52.540 --> 00:12:56.340 align:middle line:84%
So everything they did,
they did by the book.

00:12:56.340 --> 00:12:58.050 align:middle line:84%
Paulson gets in
front of the Congress

00:12:58.050 --> 00:13:00.330 align:middle line:84%
and says, if you don't
sign onto this TARP,

00:13:00.330 --> 00:13:02.010 align:middle line:84%
everything is going
to go downhill.

00:13:02.010 --> 00:13:05.080 align:middle line:84%
And then when they did sign,
they give exactly $700 billion.

00:13:05.080 --> 00:13:08.080 align:middle line:84%
But as the time has
passed, they realized--

00:13:08.080 --> 00:13:10.950 align:middle line:84%
why do we have to tell
people what we're doing?

00:13:10.950 --> 00:13:12.840 align:middle line:84%
We, the Fed, why
do we have to say,

00:13:12.840 --> 00:13:14.860 align:middle line:84%
well, we're spending
$80 billion a month?

00:13:14.860 --> 00:13:16.519 align:middle line:84%
We can spend $800
billion a month.

00:13:16.519 --> 00:13:17.560 align:middle line:90%
We can spend $20 billion.

00:13:17.560 --> 00:13:18.610 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: They won't
know the difference.

00:13:18.610 --> 00:13:19.600 align:middle line:90%
Just don't tell them.

00:13:19.600 --> 00:13:20.465 align:middle line:90%
>>HOFFMAN: Yeah.

00:13:20.465 --> 00:13:22.090 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Is that
what's been going on?

00:13:22.090 --> 00:13:23.173 align:middle line:90%
>>HOFFMAN: Yes, of course.

00:13:23.173 --> 00:13:26.500 align:middle line:84%
This is what I do for a living,
is seek these things out.

00:13:26.500 --> 00:13:29.740 align:middle line:84%
Some of them, in some cases,
the footprints are just huge.

00:13:29.740 --> 00:13:31.040 align:middle line:90%
I wrote about last year.

00:13:31.040 --> 00:13:33.373 align:middle line:84%
I wrote something called
"Proof of the Tapering Mirage."

00:13:33.373 --> 00:13:35.500 align:middle line:84%
And I said, here's
their own footprints.

00:13:35.500 --> 00:13:39.160 align:middle line:84%
They were doing $130 billion a
month, not $80 billion a month.

00:13:39.160 --> 00:13:41.500 align:middle line:84%
And even today, when
they say QE is over,

00:13:41.500 --> 00:13:44.630 align:middle line:84%
their own footprints are showing
that they're still printing

00:13:44.630 --> 00:13:46.022 align:middle line:90%
far more than they say.

00:13:46.022 --> 00:13:47.480 align:middle line:84%
And they're even
saying, yes, we're

00:13:47.480 --> 00:13:49.360 align:middle line:84%
going to reinvest the
interest from Treasury.

00:13:49.360 --> 00:13:51.160 align:middle line:90%
So they're still doing it.

00:13:51.160 --> 00:13:52.970 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Could
that be why there

00:13:52.970 --> 00:13:55.805 align:middle line:84%
hasn't been any kind of stark
reaction from the stock market?

00:13:55.805 --> 00:13:57.180 align:middle line:84%
>>HOFFMAN: Well,
the stock market

00:13:57.180 --> 00:13:58.680 align:middle line:90%
is now so totally commandeered.

00:13:58.680 --> 00:14:00.350 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes, so totally.

00:14:00.350 --> 00:14:01.040 align:middle line:90%
I laugh at it.

00:14:01.040 --> 00:14:03.414 align:middle line:84%
>>HOFFMAN: On a daily basis,
as is the gold market, which

00:14:03.414 --> 00:14:06.070 align:middle line:84%
I deal with, obviously,
treasury bonds-- in some cases,

00:14:06.070 --> 00:14:07.220 align:middle line:90%
it's covert.

00:14:07.220 --> 00:14:08.990 align:middle line:90%
In some cases, it's overt.

00:14:08.990 --> 00:14:11.631 align:middle line:84%
The Fed says, we are
buying treasury bonds.

00:14:11.631 --> 00:14:13.880 align:middle line:84%
The Bank of Japan says, we
are buying Japanese stocks.

00:14:13.880 --> 00:14:14.740 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: We're going to
get into that in a bit.

00:14:14.740 --> 00:14:15.406 align:middle line:90%
>>HOFFMAN: Yeah.

00:14:15.406 --> 00:14:19.370 align:middle line:84%
So the point is, when
someone says to me--

00:14:19.370 --> 00:14:20.990 align:middle line:90%
why is the market doing this?

00:14:20.990 --> 00:14:22.710 align:middle line:84%
Or why is, let's
say, gold falling?

00:14:22.710 --> 00:14:24.500 align:middle line:90%
I say, gold is not falling.

00:14:24.500 --> 00:14:25.630 align:middle line:90%
It is being taken down.

00:14:25.630 --> 00:14:27.150 align:middle line:90%
The market is not doing this.

00:14:27.150 --> 00:14:28.950 align:middle line:90%
It is being moved around.

00:14:28.950 --> 00:14:32.400 align:middle line:84%
And in fact, sometimes I
argue that the Fed is actually

00:14:32.400 --> 00:14:33.960 align:middle line:90%
doing the opposite of QE.

00:14:33.960 --> 00:14:36.430 align:middle line:84%
Because the Fed's
job now, what they've

00:14:36.430 --> 00:14:39.890 align:middle line:84%
realized over time as
this crisis has unfolded,

00:14:39.890 --> 00:14:43.320 align:middle line:84%
is that their job is not to
save the economy, as they say.

00:14:43.320 --> 00:14:46.610 align:middle line:84%
Their job is to save
the financial markets.

00:14:46.610 --> 00:14:48.960 align:middle line:84%
And what they say is
simply cater to what

00:14:48.960 --> 00:14:50.130 align:middle line:90%
the markets want to hear.

00:14:50.130 --> 00:14:52.990 align:middle line:84%
And what they do is simply
cater to making the markets do

00:14:52.990 --> 00:14:54.290 align:middle line:90%
what they want it to do.

00:14:54.290 --> 00:14:58.870 align:middle line:84%
Now, over time, this-- like
every other effort to do this--

00:14:58.870 --> 00:15:00.399 align:middle line:90%
has failed miserably.

00:15:00.399 --> 00:15:02.190 align:middle line:84%
And already, you could
see the signs of it.

00:15:02.190 --> 00:15:04.410 align:middle line:84%
Look what's happening in
the commodity markets,

00:15:04.410 --> 00:15:07.580 align:middle line:84%
in the currency markets,
where you're seeing,

00:15:07.580 --> 00:15:08.880 align:middle line:90%
literally, currencies crashing.

00:15:08.880 --> 00:15:10.910 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Yeah, I was going
to get into that a little bit

00:15:10.910 --> 00:15:11.410 align:middle line:90%
later.

00:15:11.410 --> 00:15:14.330 align:middle line:84%
But why don't you go into it
now, and some of the nations

00:15:14.330 --> 00:15:15.840 align:middle line:90%
that are most vulnerable?

00:15:15.840 --> 00:15:21.430 align:middle line:84%
And here we've been hearing that
the US was going to be removed

00:15:21.430 --> 00:15:23.905 align:middle line:90%
as the standard for trade.

00:15:23.905 --> 00:15:25.780 align:middle line:84%
And the euro was going
to be taking its place

00:15:25.780 --> 00:15:27.550 align:middle line:90%
as the global reserve note.

00:15:27.550 --> 00:15:29.455 align:middle line:90%
Well, that hasn't happened.

00:15:29.455 --> 00:15:31.830 align:middle line:84%
And then you read that the
only reason it hasn't happened

00:15:31.830 --> 00:15:34.490 align:middle line:84%
is because the other countries
are in so much worse shape.

00:15:34.490 --> 00:15:36.890 align:middle line:84%
Why go after the
dollar at this point?

00:15:36.890 --> 00:15:38.050 align:middle line:90%
It's just a relative thing.

00:15:38.050 --> 00:15:40.750 align:middle line:84%
The dollar is not theoretically
in good shape at all.

00:15:40.750 --> 00:15:43.500 align:middle line:84%
But what's happening elsewhere
that would allow it to maintain

00:15:43.500 --> 00:15:44.984 align:middle line:90%
its reserve currency status?

00:15:44.984 --> 00:15:46.900 align:middle line:84%
>>HOFFMAN: Well, it
certainly won't be Europe,

00:15:46.900 --> 00:15:49.640 align:middle line:84%
because I believe
the euro itself is

00:15:49.640 --> 00:15:51.240 align:middle line:90%
on the verge of breaking apart.

00:15:51.240 --> 00:15:53.030 align:middle line:84%
And it's only been
around for 15 years.

00:15:53.030 --> 00:15:55.740 align:middle line:90%
That's what the sad thing is.

00:15:55.740 --> 00:15:59.210 align:middle line:84%
Obviously, look, these
are all paper currencies.

00:15:59.210 --> 00:16:00.890 align:middle line:90%
They're all trash.

00:16:00.890 --> 00:16:02.765 align:middle line:84%
You can even talk about
the Chinese currency.

00:16:02.765 --> 00:16:05.400 align:middle line:84%
It's literally pegged
to the US dollar.

00:16:05.400 --> 00:16:08.460 align:middle line:90%
It's not a real currency.

00:16:08.460 --> 00:16:11.300 align:middle line:84%
When all this is over, when
this Ponzi scheme ends,

00:16:11.300 --> 00:16:12.980 align:middle line:84%
it's going to be
the nations that

00:16:12.980 --> 00:16:15.420 align:middle line:84%
have the gold, that have
the manufacturing market

00:16:15.420 --> 00:16:18.080 align:middle line:84%
share, that are going to be
the leaders in the new economy.

00:16:18.080 --> 00:16:19.410 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Well,
there's China for you.

00:16:19.410 --> 00:16:21.330 align:middle line:84%
>>HOFFMAN: That's
right-- China, Russia.

00:16:21.330 --> 00:16:22.080 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Germany?

00:16:22.080 --> 00:16:24.500 align:middle line:84%
>>HOFFMAN: Well,
Germany is probably

00:16:24.500 --> 00:16:26.360 align:middle line:84%
going to be toward that
block, because they

00:16:26.360 --> 00:16:28.410 align:middle line:90%
have a lot of those things.

00:16:28.410 --> 00:16:31.220 align:middle line:84%
But as of right now, it's just
one currency against the other.

00:16:31.220 --> 00:16:33.030 align:middle line:90%
It's meaningless.

00:16:33.030 --> 00:16:35.140 align:middle line:84%
As reserve currency,
the dollar is

00:16:35.140 --> 00:16:37.180 align:middle line:84%
dying-- these deals
that are being

00:16:37.180 --> 00:16:40.430 align:middle line:84%
made every day between
China and everyone else, all

00:16:40.430 --> 00:16:43.360 align:middle line:84%
the hatred of the United
States because of what we've

00:16:43.360 --> 00:16:45.170 align:middle line:84%
done politically
and economically,

00:16:45.170 --> 00:16:47.600 align:middle line:84%
mostly because of what the
Federal Reserve has done,

00:16:47.600 --> 00:16:49.900 align:middle line:84%
creating this inflation
all over the world.

00:16:49.900 --> 00:16:53.080 align:middle line:84%
So look, there's been
plenty of reserve currencies

00:16:53.080 --> 00:16:56.920 align:middle line:84%
over time-- the British
pound, the Spanish peseta,

00:16:56.920 --> 00:17:00.500 align:middle line:90%
the French franc.

00:17:00.500 --> 00:17:01.450 align:middle line:90%
Even Portugal had it.

00:17:01.450 --> 00:17:03.190 align:middle line:90%
And Holland, at one time, did.

00:17:03.190 --> 00:17:05.670 align:middle line:84%
And in time, the US won't
be the reserve currency.

00:17:05.670 --> 00:17:07.780 align:middle line:84%
It'll be a major, major
shock to the standard

00:17:07.780 --> 00:17:09.640 align:middle line:84%
of living of Americans,
but it probably

00:17:09.640 --> 00:17:11.630 align:middle line:90%
won't happen overnight.

00:17:11.630 --> 00:17:14.440 align:middle line:84%
But more importantly,
what Americans will see--

00:17:14.440 --> 00:17:17.560 align:middle line:84%
and the whole world will see--
is declining standard of living

00:17:17.560 --> 00:17:19.115 align:middle line:90%
and a higher cost of living.

00:17:19.115 --> 00:17:22.010 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So which countries
are particularly vulnerable

00:17:22.010 --> 00:17:25.020 align:middle line:90%
now in a currency status?

00:17:25.020 --> 00:17:28.869 align:middle line:84%
And also, let's get into
the notion of revaluations,

00:17:28.869 --> 00:17:30.410 align:middle line:84%
because a lot of
people watching this

00:17:30.410 --> 00:17:33.100 align:middle line:84%
are hanging on to their
dong and dinar and whatnot.

00:17:33.100 --> 00:17:35.650 align:middle line:84%
But let's talk about it
in a more global sense.

00:17:35.650 --> 00:17:37.019 align:middle line:90%
>>HOFFMAN: Right.

00:17:37.019 --> 00:17:38.560 align:middle line:84%
Well, again, the
biggest thing people

00:17:38.560 --> 00:17:41.180 align:middle line:84%
need to realize is that no
matter what currency you're in,

00:17:41.180 --> 00:17:42.980 align:middle line:90%
it's backed by nothing.

00:17:42.980 --> 00:17:46.580 align:middle line:84%
And what I've been saying
all along is, look,

00:17:46.580 --> 00:17:49.890 align:middle line:84%
the United States
has the furthest

00:17:49.890 --> 00:17:52.690 align:middle line:84%
to fall because we've been
propped up all these years

00:17:52.690 --> 00:17:54.510 align:middle line:90%
by the reserve currency.

00:17:54.510 --> 00:17:56.990 align:middle line:84%
But we're going to be
the last to go down,

00:17:56.990 --> 00:18:00.660 align:middle line:84%
barring some cataclysmic event,
because we have this market

00:18:00.660 --> 00:18:02.820 align:middle line:84%
power from having
the reserve currency.

00:18:02.820 --> 00:18:05.110 align:middle line:84%
That's why you're seeing--
yes, the inflation

00:18:05.110 --> 00:18:08.400 align:middle line:84%
here and the economic
weakness is bad.

00:18:08.400 --> 00:18:11.250 align:middle line:84%
But the rest of the world
needs to keep printing money

00:18:11.250 --> 00:18:12.150 align:middle line:90%
to keep up with us.

00:18:12.150 --> 00:18:14.120 align:middle line:84%
And when you don't
have reserve currency,

00:18:14.120 --> 00:18:15.940 align:middle line:90%
that causes major inflation.

00:18:15.940 --> 00:18:19.730 align:middle line:84%
And that's why you're seeing
significant social unrest

00:18:19.730 --> 00:18:20.690 align:middle line:90%
in major places.

00:18:20.690 --> 00:18:23.360 align:middle line:84%
And we're talking
about Europe right now,

00:18:23.360 --> 00:18:27.380 align:middle line:84%
in South America, in
parts of Asia right now,

00:18:27.380 --> 00:18:29.920 align:middle line:84%
all because of this
money printing.

00:18:29.920 --> 00:18:34.270 align:middle line:84%
And just this little mini crisis
that we've had in this fall,

00:18:34.270 --> 00:18:39.370 align:middle line:84%
you've seen record declines of
currencies around the world.

00:18:39.370 --> 00:18:41.970 align:middle line:84%
Last time, we talked
about the fragile five,

00:18:41.970 --> 00:18:45.260 align:middle line:84%
which is Indonesia,
India, Turkey, South

00:18:45.260 --> 00:18:46.510 align:middle line:90%
Africa, and Brazil.

00:18:46.510 --> 00:18:49.600 align:middle line:84%
These five currencies,
on average, are down 40%

00:18:49.600 --> 00:18:51.770 align:middle line:84%
against the dollar in
the last three years.

00:18:51.770 --> 00:18:56.000 align:middle line:84%
And that's since we started all
over QE, our Operation Twist,

00:18:56.000 --> 00:18:57.030 align:middle line:90%
our QE3, QE4.

00:18:57.030 --> 00:18:59.140 align:middle line:10%
That's when Japan
started its Abenomics,

00:18:59.140 --> 00:19:01.670 align:middle line:10%
when the ECB started its LTRO.

00:19:01.670 --> 00:19:03.550 align:middle line:10%
So again, it starts
in the emerging--

00:19:03.550 --> 00:19:04.890 align:middle line:10%
>>REGINA: So these
countries are suffering?

00:19:04.890 --> 00:19:05.515 align:middle line:90%
>>HOFFMAN: Yes.

00:19:05.515 --> 00:19:09.080 align:middle line:84%
The emerging markets see
the most the fastest.

00:19:09.080 --> 00:19:10.740 align:middle line:90%
And we're seeing that right now.

00:19:10.740 --> 00:19:13.510 align:middle line:84%
But it is slowly
creeping up the ladder.

00:19:13.510 --> 00:19:15.280 align:middle line:84%
You look at what's
going on in Europe.

00:19:15.280 --> 00:19:16.710 align:middle line:90%
This is first-world economies.

00:19:16.710 --> 00:19:20.110 align:middle line:84%
You look at what's going on
in Japan, the third largest

00:19:20.110 --> 00:19:22.140 align:middle line:84%
economy in the world,
and even China,

00:19:22.140 --> 00:19:24.980 align:middle line:84%
where this historic real
estate bubble is crashing,

00:19:24.980 --> 00:19:27.000 align:middle line:90%
right in front of our eyes.

00:19:27.000 --> 00:19:30.660 align:middle line:84%
So there's no real place to
hide from a Fiat Ponzi scheme,

00:19:30.660 --> 00:19:32.675 align:middle line:90%
except gold and silver.

00:19:32.675 --> 00:19:33.720 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: OK.

00:19:33.720 --> 00:19:36.790 align:middle line:84%
And other resources, I would
assume, are also on the table.

00:19:36.790 --> 00:19:39.290 align:middle line:84%
When you're looking at having
a reserve status, for example,

00:19:39.290 --> 00:19:42.330 align:middle line:84%
wouldn't it makes sense if
your country had some kind

00:19:42.330 --> 00:19:43.710 align:middle line:90%
of resource to back it?

00:19:43.710 --> 00:19:45.560 align:middle line:90%
>>HOFFMAN: It certainly helps.

00:19:45.560 --> 00:19:46.970 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: And I'm thinking.

00:19:46.970 --> 00:19:48.890 align:middle line:84%
Right now, we're looking
at the revaluation

00:19:48.890 --> 00:19:53.120 align:middle line:84%
of the Vietnamese dong-- oil--
looking at the revaluation

00:19:53.120 --> 00:19:57.370 align:middle line:90%
of the Iraqi dinar-- oil.

00:19:57.370 --> 00:20:02.180 align:middle line:84%
Does the fact that these
are backed by commodities

00:20:02.180 --> 00:20:04.320 align:middle line:84%
have something to
do with the push

00:20:04.320 --> 00:20:06.520 align:middle line:84%
for those particular
revaluations?

00:20:06.520 --> 00:20:08.140 align:middle line:90%
And should they be revalued?

00:20:08.140 --> 00:20:09.850 align:middle line:90%
We trashed both those nations.

00:20:09.850 --> 00:20:12.180 align:middle line:84%
>>HOFFMAN: Well, they're
not, quote, being revalued.

00:20:12.180 --> 00:20:15.350 align:middle line:84%
I mean, they are moving, as
they do on a daily basis.

00:20:15.350 --> 00:20:18.870 align:middle line:84%
And from the research
that I've done,

00:20:18.870 --> 00:20:20.680 align:middle line:84%
there is no currencies
in the world that

00:20:20.680 --> 00:20:23.185 align:middle line:84%
have been going up
against the dollar,

00:20:23.185 --> 00:20:24.560 align:middle line:84%
not because the
dollar is strong,

00:20:24.560 --> 00:20:29.430 align:middle line:84%
but because everyone is fleeing
from all the inflation that's

00:20:29.430 --> 00:20:31.560 align:middle line:90%
being exported around the world.

00:20:31.560 --> 00:20:35.460 align:middle line:84%
And yes, it's good to have
commodities in your nation.

00:20:35.460 --> 00:20:38.020 align:middle line:84%
But again, I wrote a
piece just last week.

00:20:38.020 --> 00:20:41.160 align:middle line:84%
It's called, "Collapsing Oil
Prices Portend Unspeakable

00:20:41.160 --> 00:20:41.660 align:middle line:90%
Horrors."

00:20:41.660 --> 00:20:43.935 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And we're going
to talk about that next.

00:20:43.935 --> 00:20:44.580 align:middle line:90%
>>HOFFMAN: Yes.

00:20:44.580 --> 00:20:47.810 align:middle line:84%
For the most part, the
countries that have all that oil

00:20:47.810 --> 00:20:50.380 align:middle line:84%
are socialist countries,
which spend all their oil

00:20:50.380 --> 00:20:54.080 align:middle line:84%
revenues on the
administration of the state.

00:20:54.080 --> 00:20:56.636 align:middle line:84%
So when you see
falling oil prices,

00:20:56.636 --> 00:20:58.010 align:middle line:84%
it sounds like
it's a good thing,

00:20:58.010 --> 00:21:00.410 align:middle line:84%
but for millions of
people around the world,

00:21:00.410 --> 00:21:01.870 align:middle line:90%
it's a very bad thing.

00:21:01.870 --> 00:21:03.930 align:middle line:84%
And we're seeing it
already, right now--

00:21:03.930 --> 00:21:05.824 align:middle line:84%
this huge drop we've
had in oil prices.

00:21:05.824 --> 00:21:07.740 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: What happened
in the last two weeks?

00:21:07.740 --> 00:21:12.060 align:middle line:84%
Here we are, early November, and
we've seen a decline from say

00:21:12.060 --> 00:21:16.210 align:middle line:84%
$3.40 down to $2.80 in
gasoline prices at the pump.

00:21:16.210 --> 00:21:18.640 align:middle line:84%
>>HOFFMAN: Well,
the crude oil price

00:21:18.640 --> 00:21:20.580 align:middle line:90%
has fallen from $100, $110.

00:21:20.580 --> 00:21:24.170 align:middle line:84%
Now, this morning, it
got down to $76 a barrel.

00:21:24.170 --> 00:21:24.870 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Why?

00:21:24.870 --> 00:21:26.700 align:middle line:84%
>>HOFFMAN: As we
talked about before,

00:21:26.700 --> 00:21:28.470 align:middle line:90%
it's the economy, stupid.

00:21:28.470 --> 00:21:29.530 align:middle line:90%
It's not just oil.

00:21:29.530 --> 00:21:32.310 align:middle line:84%
The media likes to talk
about-- look, oil is down.

00:21:32.310 --> 00:21:32.840 align:middle line:90%
That's good.

00:21:32.840 --> 00:21:34.490 align:middle line:84%
Well, first of all,
it's never good

00:21:34.490 --> 00:21:35.920 align:middle line:90%
when commodities are crashing.

00:21:35.920 --> 00:21:38.240 align:middle line:84%
Generally, it's
because demand is weak.

00:21:38.240 --> 00:21:40.290 align:middle line:84%
But as I've been
writing forever--

00:21:40.290 --> 00:21:42.400 align:middle line:84%
I wrote a piece called
"Commodity Crash"

00:21:42.400 --> 00:21:43.490 align:middle line:90%
a few weeks ago.

00:21:43.490 --> 00:21:45.950 align:middle line:90%
It's all of the commodities.

00:21:45.950 --> 00:21:47.860 align:middle line:90%
You look at the base metals.

00:21:47.860 --> 00:21:51.577 align:middle line:84%
You look at iron, cement,
copper, all these things,

00:21:51.577 --> 00:21:52.410 align:middle line:90%
they're all falling.

00:21:52.410 --> 00:21:54.326 align:middle line:84%
Even some of the food
commodities are falling,

00:21:54.326 --> 00:21:56.550 align:middle line:84%
not the ones affected by
these horrible droughts.

00:21:56.550 --> 00:21:58.915 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Yet their
prices keep going up.

00:21:58.915 --> 00:22:01.020 align:middle line:84%
>>HOFFMAN: But generally
speaking, you're

00:22:01.020 --> 00:22:04.060 align:middle line:84%
seeing across the board
declines in commodities

00:22:04.060 --> 00:22:05.920 align:middle line:90%
because of economic demand.

00:22:05.920 --> 00:22:08.450 align:middle line:84%
And what we're
seeing now with oil

00:22:08.450 --> 00:22:09.840 align:middle line:90%
has to do with a lot of things.

00:22:09.840 --> 00:22:13.520 align:middle line:84%
One of them, of course, was
this phony shale oil boom.

00:22:13.520 --> 00:22:15.970 align:middle line:84%
And again, I spent 10
years on Wall Street

00:22:15.970 --> 00:22:18.970 align:middle line:84%
as an energy
analyst, watching all

00:22:18.970 --> 00:22:20.690 align:middle line:84%
of the new things
that were going

00:22:20.690 --> 00:22:22.230 align:middle line:90%
to create energy independence.

00:22:22.230 --> 00:22:24.940 align:middle line:84%
There's this great video showing
every president going back

00:22:24.940 --> 00:22:27.960 align:middle line:84%
to Jimmy Carter
and Nixon saying,

00:22:27.960 --> 00:22:29.550 align:middle line:84%
we're going to be
energy independent.

00:22:29.550 --> 00:22:32.070 align:middle line:84%
And it's always for these
reasons that don't pan out.

00:22:32.070 --> 00:22:33.320 align:middle line:90%
And I've seen them all.

00:22:33.320 --> 00:22:37.490 align:middle line:10%
The latest is shale oil, which
is extremely heavily depleting.

00:22:37.490 --> 00:22:39.710 align:middle line:10%
It's extremely
capital intensive.

00:22:39.710 --> 00:22:43.260 align:middle line:10%
And again, it's the
Federal Reserve.

00:22:43.260 --> 00:22:44.860 align:middle line:90%
They push rates down to nothing.

00:22:44.860 --> 00:22:47.510 align:middle line:84%
Wall Street got all
excited and lent trillions,

00:22:47.510 --> 00:22:49.580 align:middle line:84%
or let's call it
hundreds of billions,

00:22:49.580 --> 00:22:52.640 align:middle line:84%
to this industry, which is now
heavily indebted, at a time

00:22:52.640 --> 00:22:56.560 align:middle line:84%
that oil prices are falling
below the cost of production.

00:22:56.560 --> 00:22:58.990 align:middle line:84%
So again, that was another
reason why oil is falling.

00:22:58.990 --> 00:23:01.240 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Do you think it's
going to continue falling?

00:23:01.240 --> 00:23:04.080 align:middle line:84%
Is there any indication
we're close to bottoming out?

00:23:04.080 --> 00:23:07.710 align:middle line:84%
>>HOFFMAN: Well, again, I'm
not in the financial analyst

00:23:07.710 --> 00:23:08.210 align:middle line:90%
business.

00:23:08.210 --> 00:23:09.385 align:middle line:84%
I'm not here to
make a prediction.

00:23:09.385 --> 00:23:10.880 align:middle line:84%
If you ask me what I
think is going to happen--

00:23:10.880 --> 00:23:11.950 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: I'll just
ask you what you think.

00:23:11.950 --> 00:23:14.440 align:middle line:84%
>>HOFFMAN: I believe that
commodities will continue

00:23:14.440 --> 00:23:16.850 align:middle line:84%
to fall for a long
time, because there's

00:23:16.850 --> 00:23:20.140 align:middle line:84%
massive oversupply that's been
built up by all this money

00:23:20.140 --> 00:23:22.840 align:middle line:84%
printing, especially in
China, over the years,

00:23:22.840 --> 00:23:25.260 align:middle line:90%
and decline in usage.

00:23:25.260 --> 00:23:27.140 align:middle line:84%
You look at just in
the United States,

00:23:27.140 --> 00:23:30.729 align:middle line:84%
the retail usage of
gasoline has plummeted.

00:23:30.729 --> 00:23:32.520 align:middle line:84%
We're talking about,
for the last 10 years,

00:23:32.520 --> 00:23:33.800 align:middle line:90%
it's down-- what is it-- 15%.

00:23:33.800 --> 00:23:35.630 align:middle line:90%
It's some very big number.

00:23:35.630 --> 00:23:39.035 align:middle line:84%
And part of it is, yes,
there's some telecommuting

00:23:39.035 --> 00:23:40.174 align:middle line:90%
and those kind of things.

00:23:40.174 --> 00:23:42.340 align:middle line:84%
But generally speaking,
it's because of the economy.

00:23:42.340 --> 00:23:47.200 align:middle line:84%
I saw a fantastic graph today
showing a 94% correlation

00:23:47.200 --> 00:23:50.730 align:middle line:84%
between retail sales of
gasoline and the labor force

00:23:50.730 --> 00:23:51.830 align:middle line:90%
participation rate.

00:23:51.830 --> 00:23:53.496 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Of course,
that's interesting.

00:23:53.496 --> 00:23:56.400 align:middle line:84%
>>HOFFMAN: Which as you know, is
at a 36-year low-- and not only

00:23:56.400 --> 00:23:59.230 align:middle line:84%
that, when we say
36-year low, for men

00:23:59.230 --> 00:24:00.980 align:middle line:90%
it's at an all-time low.

00:24:00.980 --> 00:24:03.400 align:middle line:84%
Remember, we're
talking about 1978

00:24:03.400 --> 00:24:05.250 align:middle line:84%
is the last time
that it was this low,

00:24:05.250 --> 00:24:06.680 align:middle line:84%
but that was
because it was right

00:24:06.680 --> 00:24:08.560 align:middle line:84%
after the gold
standard was abandoned.

00:24:08.560 --> 00:24:10.450 align:middle line:84%
And the prices of
living went up.

00:24:10.450 --> 00:24:12.160 align:middle line:84%
And all of a sudden,
all the women

00:24:12.160 --> 00:24:14.096 align:middle line:90%
had to go to work to afford--

00:24:14.096 --> 00:24:16.650 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And out of college,
the girls are getting the jobs.

00:24:16.650 --> 00:24:17.316 align:middle line:90%
>>HOFFMAN: Yeah.

00:24:17.316 --> 00:24:21.570 align:middle line:84%
So the point is the actual
labor participation rate, apples

00:24:21.570 --> 00:24:23.070 align:middle line:90%
to apples, is all time low.

00:24:23.070 --> 00:24:26.120 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: I have a
question on that note.

00:24:26.120 --> 00:24:31.290 align:middle line:84%
The females are statistically
more highly employable--

00:24:31.290 --> 00:24:32.950 align:middle line:84%
not employable, but
more highly sought

00:24:32.950 --> 00:24:35.450 align:middle line:84%
after-- upon
graduation from college

00:24:35.450 --> 00:24:37.580 align:middle line:84%
right now, from what I've
seen, than the males.

00:24:37.580 --> 00:24:41.030 align:middle line:84%
Is that still because there is
a double standard in the wages?

00:24:41.030 --> 00:24:43.110 align:middle line:90%
I certainly see this all around.

00:24:43.110 --> 00:24:44.930 align:middle line:84%
Women arent-- there's
no equality yet.

00:24:44.930 --> 00:24:48.260 align:middle line:84%
>>HOFFMAN: This isn't
my field of expertise.

00:24:48.260 --> 00:24:50.670 align:middle line:90%
And I wasn't aware of that.

00:24:50.670 --> 00:24:53.560 align:middle line:84%
I can give you a little
anecdote from my China

00:24:53.560 --> 00:24:55.150 align:middle line:84%
world, since you
know that I adopted

00:24:55.150 --> 00:24:59.220 align:middle line:90%
from China two years ago.

00:24:59.220 --> 00:25:02.140 align:middle line:84%
It's long been
known that males are

00:25:02.140 --> 00:25:04.340 align:middle line:90%
sought over females over there.

00:25:04.340 --> 00:25:07.330 align:middle line:84%
And that's why they would always
give up the female children

00:25:07.330 --> 00:25:08.320 align:middle line:90%
for adoption.

00:25:08.320 --> 00:25:09.737 align:middle line:84%
But that's completely
changed now.

00:25:09.737 --> 00:25:12.028 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Yes, because the
boys are left with no girls.

00:25:12.028 --> 00:25:13.900 align:middle line:84%
>>HOFFMAN: One, because
of demographics,

00:25:13.900 --> 00:25:17.690 align:middle line:84%
but also because they said
that the culture is changed

00:25:17.690 --> 00:25:20.940 align:middle line:84%
to the point where females
are more desirable to have

00:25:20.940 --> 00:25:22.060 align:middle line:90%
around the household.

00:25:22.060 --> 00:25:24.980 align:middle line:90%
They're more prudent with money.

00:25:24.980 --> 00:25:26.270 align:middle line:90%
They don't feel as empowered.

00:25:26.270 --> 00:25:29.190 align:middle line:84%
So there's a lot of changes
going on in the world.

00:25:29.190 --> 00:25:31.970 align:middle line:84%
If that happens in America,
I wouldn't be surprised

00:25:31.970 --> 00:25:34.400 align:middle line:84%
if somehow they think
they can pay them less,

00:25:34.400 --> 00:25:36.880 align:middle line:84%
even though it's harder
to do that these days.

00:25:36.880 --> 00:25:41.050 align:middle line:84%
But again, very few people are
sought after out of college

00:25:41.050 --> 00:25:41.720 align:middle line:90%
these days.

00:25:41.720 --> 00:25:45.560 align:middle line:84%
We're talking about-- this
is the highest student

00:25:45.560 --> 00:25:48.320 align:middle line:84%
debt you've ever had
and also the lowest jobs

00:25:48.320 --> 00:25:50.910 align:middle line:90%
coming out of college.

00:25:50.910 --> 00:25:54.840 align:middle line:84%
I think I just read that the
average 25-year-old right now

00:25:54.840 --> 00:25:57.510 align:middle line:84%
has $20,000 of
student loan debt.

00:25:57.510 --> 00:26:01.990 align:middle line:84%
I mean, $20,000 is a lot of
money to try to pay back.

00:26:01.990 --> 00:26:03.650 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Yes,
especially if you're

00:26:03.650 --> 00:26:07.044 align:middle line:84%
making a substandard
wage when you graduate.

00:26:07.044 --> 00:26:09.210 align:middle line:84%
I'm going to pick up on
something from a moment ago.

00:26:09.210 --> 00:26:10.501 align:middle line:90%
I made a little note to myself.

00:26:10.501 --> 00:26:16.470 align:middle line:84%
You were talking about how
none of these currencies

00:26:16.470 --> 00:26:20.320 align:middle line:84%
have any kind of serious
commodities backing and such.

00:26:20.320 --> 00:26:22.440 align:middle line:84%
And I was thinking, but
what about the rinminbi

00:26:22.440 --> 00:26:24.310 align:middle line:90%
or the yuan, the Chinese yuan.

00:26:24.310 --> 00:26:26.550 align:middle line:84%
They've been, from
what I understand,

00:26:26.550 --> 00:26:28.700 align:middle line:84%
storehousing gold for
quite a long time,

00:26:28.700 --> 00:26:30.180 align:middle line:90%
massive amounts of gold.

00:26:30.180 --> 00:26:32.812 align:middle line:84%
Is it a gold-backed
currency, the rinminbi?

00:26:32.812 --> 00:26:35.020 align:middle line:84%
>>HOFFMAN: Well again, it's
no different than saying,

00:26:35.020 --> 00:26:37.950 align:middle line:84%
is the Iraqi dinar
backed by oil.

00:26:37.950 --> 00:26:38.980 align:middle line:90%
No, it's not.

00:26:38.980 --> 00:26:41.110 align:middle line:84%
Just because there is
oil in the country,

00:26:41.110 --> 00:26:43.910 align:middle line:84%
it certainly is a
positive economic force

00:26:43.910 --> 00:26:45.010 align:middle line:90%
to have resources.

00:26:45.010 --> 00:26:47.730 align:middle line:84%
It would, generally
speaking, help your nation

00:26:47.730 --> 00:26:51.550 align:middle line:84%
to do better economically and
make your currency worth more.

00:26:51.550 --> 00:26:53.700 align:middle line:84%
But the currency is not
itself backed by anything.

00:26:53.700 --> 00:26:55.700 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: But what about
the acquisition of gold

00:26:55.700 --> 00:26:57.110 align:middle line:90%
by the Chinese?

00:26:57.110 --> 00:26:58.750 align:middle line:84%
Is their currency
linked to gold?

00:26:58.750 --> 00:26:59.300 align:middle line:90%
Is it the gold backed?

00:26:59.300 --> 00:27:01.341 align:middle line:84%
>>HOFFMAN: No, the currency
is not linked at all.

00:27:01.341 --> 00:27:05.576 align:middle line:84%
In fact, the Chinese currency
is one of the most paper

00:27:05.576 --> 00:27:07.450 align:middle line:84%
currencies you're going
to find, because it's

00:27:07.450 --> 00:27:11.120 align:middle line:84%
linked dollar for dollar, or
yuan to yuan with the dollar.

00:27:11.120 --> 00:27:14.040 align:middle line:84%
So they've pegged
it, just like-- we'll

00:27:14.040 --> 00:27:16.580 align:middle line:84%
get to that-- the Swiss have
pegged the franc to the euro.

00:27:16.580 --> 00:27:19.050 align:middle line:84%
They've pegged the
yuan to the dollar.

00:27:19.050 --> 00:27:21.810 align:middle line:84%
So they have had massive
inflation over the years.

00:27:21.810 --> 00:27:24.390 align:middle line:84%
And it's also caused
these dramatic distortions

00:27:24.390 --> 00:27:26.720 align:middle line:84%
of the global
manufacturing industry,

00:27:26.720 --> 00:27:28.480 align:middle line:90%
that we allowed it to happen.

00:27:28.480 --> 00:27:29.420 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Sure.

00:27:29.420 --> 00:27:30.665 align:middle line:90%
Well, ok, I'm confused.

00:27:30.665 --> 00:27:32.350 align:middle line:84%
>>HOFFMAN: The fact that
they have gold, by the way--

00:27:32.350 --> 00:27:33.140 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: But they
have a lot of it.

00:27:33.140 --> 00:27:34.080 align:middle line:90%
>>HOFFMAN: Yes.

00:27:34.080 --> 00:27:36.550 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Why don't they
tie it to their currency?

00:27:36.550 --> 00:27:37.890 align:middle line:84%
>>HOFFMAN: Well, first of
all, they have far more gold

00:27:37.890 --> 00:27:38.890 align:middle line:90%
than they say they have.

00:27:38.890 --> 00:27:41.910 align:middle line:84%
And someday, we'll
know how much that is.

00:27:41.910 --> 00:27:44.070 align:middle line:90%
And yes, one day they will.

00:27:44.070 --> 00:27:46.610 align:middle line:84%
But the fact is, the last thing
that they want to do-- it's

00:27:46.610 --> 00:27:47.610 align:middle line:90%
a very delicate balance.

00:27:47.610 --> 00:27:49.614 align:middle line:10%
There's a status
quo going on here.

00:27:49.614 --> 00:27:51.030 align:middle line:84%
And it's a status
quo, by the way,

00:27:51.030 --> 00:27:53.380 align:middle line:84%
for the Chinese
politicians as well.

00:27:53.380 --> 00:27:56.430 align:middle line:84%
Because once that genie
is out of the bottle,

00:27:56.430 --> 00:27:59.270 align:middle line:84%
you're going to see
economic earthquakes spread

00:27:59.270 --> 00:28:00.420 align:middle line:90%
around the world.

00:28:00.420 --> 00:28:04.430 align:middle line:84%
And the current
Chinese politicians

00:28:04.430 --> 00:28:05.690 align:middle line:90%
won't survive that either.

00:28:05.690 --> 00:28:09.500 align:middle line:84%
They would like to
quietly acquire and hope

00:28:09.500 --> 00:28:12.280 align:middle line:84%
that the end game doesn't
occur on their watch.

00:28:12.280 --> 00:28:15.580 align:middle line:84%
But ultimately, as I said,
when these paper currencies

00:28:15.580 --> 00:28:18.019 align:middle line:84%
finally are dead and buried,
as they always will be--

00:28:18.019 --> 00:28:19.560 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: They'll
be standing strong.

00:28:19.560 --> 00:28:20.360 align:middle line:90%
>>HOFFMAN: Yes.

00:28:20.360 --> 00:28:22.880 align:middle line:84%
In the new order,
those who have things

00:28:22.880 --> 00:28:26.330 align:middle line:84%
of value, which would be, for
instance, gold or manufacturing

00:28:26.330 --> 00:28:28.580 align:middle line:84%
market share or
resources, are the ones

00:28:28.580 --> 00:28:31.196 align:middle line:84%
that are going to be the
leaders of the new world.

00:28:31.196 --> 00:28:32.570 align:middle line:84%
And we have none
of those things.

00:28:32.570 --> 00:28:34.120 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: No.

00:28:34.120 --> 00:28:35.815 align:middle line:90%
Let's go to the Swiss now.

00:28:35.815 --> 00:28:36.550 align:middle line:90%
>>HOFFMAN: Right.

00:28:36.550 --> 00:28:39.620 align:middle line:84%
Well look, my world
is gold, as you know.

00:28:39.620 --> 00:28:41.310 align:middle line:90%
I work for a bullion dealer.

00:28:41.310 --> 00:28:44.560 align:middle line:84%
My life, my blog is
talking about the impact

00:28:44.560 --> 00:28:47.020 align:middle line:84%
of all these factors
on gold and silver

00:28:47.020 --> 00:28:50.520 align:middle line:84%
and why should own it to
protect savings over time.

00:28:50.520 --> 00:28:54.940 align:middle line:84%
Now, the Swiss, as everyone
knows, generally speaking,

00:28:54.940 --> 00:28:57.100 align:middle line:90%
are money masters.

00:28:57.100 --> 00:28:58.800 align:middle line:84%
For such a small
country of, I think,

00:28:58.800 --> 00:29:01.030 align:middle line:84%
8 million people,
over the years,

00:29:01.030 --> 00:29:05.920 align:middle line:84%
they've created this broad power
in the financial world because

00:29:05.920 --> 00:29:07.850 align:middle line:90%
of their smarts.

00:29:07.850 --> 00:29:11.410 align:middle line:84%
Now, for many, many
years, the Swiss franc

00:29:11.410 --> 00:29:13.150 align:middle line:90%
was actually backed by gold.

00:29:13.150 --> 00:29:15.110 align:middle line:84%
In fact, they were
the last currency

00:29:15.110 --> 00:29:18.940 align:middle line:84%
to be implicitly backed
by gold, back in-- I

00:29:18.940 --> 00:29:20.451 align:middle line:90%
think it was 2000 or 1999.

00:29:20.451 --> 00:29:21.950 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: When did
end, around 2000?

00:29:21.950 --> 00:29:23.230 align:middle line:90%
>>HOFFMAN: 1999.

00:29:23.230 --> 00:29:25.630 align:middle line:84%
That's when all
good things ended.

00:29:25.630 --> 00:29:28.470 align:middle line:84%
So the powers that be
in Switzerland somehow

00:29:28.470 --> 00:29:30.659 align:middle line:84%
snuck into their
constitution that they

00:29:30.659 --> 00:29:31.950 align:middle line:90%
didn't have to do that anymore.

00:29:31.950 --> 00:29:33.890 align:middle line:84%
And they joined all
the Western powers--

00:29:33.890 --> 00:29:35.145 align:middle line:90%
the United States and England.

00:29:35.145 --> 00:29:37.750 align:middle line:84%
And they sold most
of their gold.

00:29:37.750 --> 00:29:41.290 align:middle line:84%
And the coup de
grace was in 2011,

00:29:41.290 --> 00:29:44.150 align:middle line:84%
when they pegged the
Swiss franc to the euro,

00:29:44.150 --> 00:29:47.970 align:middle line:84%
because the Swiss franc was
going up so much during all

00:29:47.970 --> 00:29:50.870 align:middle line:84%
these crises that
they said, no, we

00:29:50.870 --> 00:29:53.160 align:middle line:84%
want to get more manufacturing
market shares, so we're

00:29:53.160 --> 00:29:55.280 align:middle line:90%
going to destroy the franc.

00:29:55.280 --> 00:29:57.680 align:middle line:84%
And again, this is
just political talk.

00:29:57.680 --> 00:29:59.366 align:middle line:90%
It ultimately hurts the country.

00:29:59.366 --> 00:30:00.990 align:middle line:84%
And if you look at
their balance sheet,

00:30:00.990 --> 00:30:04.220 align:middle line:84%
it looks just like the Fed's,
exploding money printing

00:30:04.220 --> 00:30:07.830 align:middle line:84%
over the last three years,
simply to maintain that peg.

00:30:07.830 --> 00:30:09.486 align:middle line:84%
And if you look
at the euro, it's

00:30:09.486 --> 00:30:11.110 align:middle line:84%
at the lowest level
it's been in years.

00:30:11.110 --> 00:30:12.490 align:middle line:84%
So it's been a
complete disaster.

00:30:12.490 --> 00:30:14.990 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: What's it at right
now, say, pegged to the dollar?

00:30:14.990 --> 00:30:16.489 align:middle line:84%
>>HOFFMAN: To the
dollar, it's 1.25.

00:30:16.489 --> 00:30:17.330 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Oh, yeah.

00:30:17.330 --> 00:30:18.180 align:middle line:90%
That's low.

00:30:18.180 --> 00:30:22.100 align:middle line:84%
>>HOFFMAN: Yeah, so the point
is, even the average Swiss

00:30:22.100 --> 00:30:25.130 align:middle line:84%
knows they can look-- especially
with this referendum coming

00:30:25.130 --> 00:30:26.000 align:middle line:90%
up-- and see.

00:30:26.000 --> 00:30:27.710 align:middle line:84%
Well, we did this
horrible experiment.

00:30:27.710 --> 00:30:30.120 align:middle line:84%
First of all, 15 years
ago, we sold our gold

00:30:30.120 --> 00:30:32.240 align:middle line:90%
at like $500 an ounce.

00:30:32.240 --> 00:30:35.670 align:middle line:84%
Second of all, we've pegged our
currency to this horrible dying

00:30:35.670 --> 00:30:37.390 align:middle line:90%
euro, which has only fallen.

00:30:37.390 --> 00:30:39.739 align:middle line:84%
And it's cost our
country trillions

00:30:39.739 --> 00:30:41.780 align:middle line:84%
or-- I don't even know
what the number-- hundreds

00:30:41.780 --> 00:30:43.720 align:middle line:84%
of billions worth
of printed money

00:30:43.720 --> 00:30:45.260 align:middle line:90%
that's gone down the drain.

00:30:45.260 --> 00:30:47.600 align:middle line:84%
And the economy of Europe is
worse than it's ever been.

00:30:47.600 --> 00:30:50.010 align:middle line:84%
And Switzerland is
certainly no better off.

00:30:50.010 --> 00:30:51.650 align:middle line:84%
Switzerland just
had a referendum

00:30:51.650 --> 00:30:55.560 align:middle line:84%
to raise their minimum wage to,
I think, it was $27 an hour,

00:30:55.560 --> 00:30:58.050 align:middle line:84%
because the cost of living
has gotten so high there

00:30:58.050 --> 00:31:00.060 align:middle line:90%
because of what they're doing.

00:31:00.060 --> 00:31:01.610 align:middle line:90%
So meanwhile, here we are.

00:31:01.610 --> 00:31:04.110 align:middle line:84%
You know that they're a direct
democracy in Switzerland.

00:31:04.110 --> 00:31:06.012 align:middle line:84%
They're the last remaining
direct democracy,

00:31:06.012 --> 00:31:07.470 align:middle line:84%
where if you get
enough signatures,

00:31:07.470 --> 00:31:10.430 align:middle line:84%
you can actually have the
people vote to change the law.

00:31:10.430 --> 00:31:13.750 align:middle line:84%
And lo and behold, a
referendum is around

00:31:13.750 --> 00:31:16.820 align:middle line:84%
that's going to be voted on
November 30, whether they

00:31:16.820 --> 00:31:21.710 align:middle line:84%
should de-link the
franc from the euro

00:31:21.710 --> 00:31:24.070 align:middle line:84%
and relink it to
gold, which would

00:31:24.070 --> 00:31:28.530 align:middle line:84%
require them to buy something
like $80 billion worth of gold.

00:31:28.530 --> 00:31:29.521 align:middle line:90%
It's a big deal.

00:31:29.521 --> 00:31:31.020 align:middle line:84%
And of course, the
whole world would

00:31:31.020 --> 00:31:35.540 align:middle line:84%
see this validation of gold
for what it really is-- money.

00:31:35.540 --> 00:31:37.050 align:middle line:90%
So it's a very, very big vote.

00:31:37.050 --> 00:31:40.760 align:middle line:84%
And right now, you're seeing
major, major propaganda

00:31:40.760 --> 00:31:43.010 align:middle line:84%
going against it,
trying to prevent

00:31:43.010 --> 00:31:46.135 align:middle line:84%
what could be a life-changing
event for a lot of the world.

00:31:46.135 --> 00:31:48.782 align:middle line:90%


00:31:48.782 --> 00:31:51.240 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: What was
the real reason

00:31:51.240 --> 00:31:53.860 align:middle line:84%
that the governments
of the US-- and I

00:31:53.860 --> 00:31:56.240 align:middle line:84%
assume other governments as
well-- started cracking down

00:31:56.240 --> 00:32:00.170 align:middle line:84%
on Swiss bank accounts and
started causing some turbulence

00:32:00.170 --> 00:32:01.830 align:middle line:90%
in their own banking system?

00:32:01.830 --> 00:32:03.570 align:middle line:84%
What was the real
reason for that?

00:32:03.570 --> 00:32:06.010 align:middle line:84%
And if they are
backed by gold again,

00:32:06.010 --> 00:32:09.680 align:middle line:84%
do you think there's going to
be a resurgence of Swiss banking

00:32:09.680 --> 00:32:12.620 align:middle line:90%
among the global wealth.

00:32:12.620 --> 00:32:15.560 align:middle line:84%
>>HOFFMAN: Well, if
they vote yes, it's

00:32:15.560 --> 00:32:17.580 align:middle line:84%
so funny how even
the average Swiss has

00:32:17.580 --> 00:32:19.760 align:middle line:84%
no idea what a positive
development this would be.

00:32:19.760 --> 00:32:22.290 align:middle line:84%
And again, there are going to
be shockwaves around the world

00:32:22.290 --> 00:32:23.310 align:middle line:90%
from a lot of things.

00:32:23.310 --> 00:32:25.240 align:middle line:84%
For instance, if
they do vote yes,

00:32:25.240 --> 00:32:28.665 align:middle line:84%
there's going be a lot of chaos
in the financial world, which

00:32:28.665 --> 00:32:29.540 align:middle line:90%
will impact everyone.

00:32:29.540 --> 00:32:31.580 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Tell about the ripple
effects and how that works.

00:32:31.580 --> 00:32:32.205 align:middle line:90%
>>HOFFMAN: Yes.

00:32:32.205 --> 00:32:34.840 align:middle line:84%
Well again, you're going
to see a loss of confidence

00:32:34.840 --> 00:32:36.040 align:middle line:90%
in paper currencies.

00:32:36.040 --> 00:32:37.580 align:middle line:84%
As gold is validated,
you're going

00:32:37.580 --> 00:32:41.470 align:middle line:84%
to see a rush into physical
metal, where there's

00:32:41.470 --> 00:32:42.760 align:middle line:90%
very little of it out there.

00:32:42.760 --> 00:32:45.150 align:middle line:84%
And it could cause
this kind of fear

00:32:45.150 --> 00:32:47.800 align:middle line:90%
out, that something is wrong.

00:32:47.800 --> 00:32:48.969 align:middle line:90%
It would be a major thing.

00:32:48.969 --> 00:32:51.010 align:middle line:84%
But the thing is, I don't
think the Swiss realize

00:32:51.010 --> 00:32:55.050 align:middle line:84%
what a positive it would be
for them, if this happens.

00:32:55.050 --> 00:32:59.790 align:middle line:84%
Because yes, people will want to
put their money in Switzerland,

00:32:59.790 --> 00:33:02.860 align:middle line:84%
because they'll trust
the one currency that's

00:33:02.860 --> 00:33:04.260 align:middle line:90%
backed by something.

00:33:04.260 --> 00:33:06.650 align:middle line:84%
And this is what the powers
that be around the world

00:33:06.650 --> 00:33:07.400 align:middle line:90%
are so scared of.

00:33:07.400 --> 00:33:08.910 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: What about all
those foreign accounts,

00:33:08.910 --> 00:33:10.540 align:middle line:84%
where people were locked
out of their accounts?

00:33:10.540 --> 00:33:10.960 align:middle line:90%
What actually happened?

00:33:10.960 --> 00:33:12.520 align:middle line:90%
>>HOFFMAN: Why did we do that?

00:33:12.520 --> 00:33:14.689 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: It was supposedly
dirty money or whatever.

00:33:14.689 --> 00:33:16.730 align:middle line:84%
>>HOFFMAN: You know, it's
not dirty money though.

00:33:16.730 --> 00:33:17.720 align:middle line:90%
It's just insanity.

00:33:17.720 --> 00:33:19.136 align:middle line:84%
It's one of these
things where you

00:33:19.136 --> 00:33:22.410 align:middle line:84%
see we're at the height--
we're at the peak of an empire.

00:33:22.410 --> 00:33:23.260 align:middle line:90%
We passed the peak.

00:33:23.260 --> 00:33:24.760 align:middle line:84%
But when you see
an empire like ours

00:33:24.760 --> 00:33:27.770 align:middle line:84%
start to go downhill and make
these cataclysmic decisions,

00:33:27.770 --> 00:33:32.470 align:middle line:84%
it's like saying, why are
we trying to provoke Russia.

00:33:32.470 --> 00:33:34.810 align:middle line:84%
Why are we trying to
bomb everywhere we can?

00:33:34.810 --> 00:33:37.380 align:middle line:84%
Why we alienating
everyone we can?

00:33:37.380 --> 00:33:40.500 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Why did we try
to tick off Switzerland?

00:33:40.500 --> 00:33:44.990 align:middle line:84%
>>HOFFMAN: The simplest example
would be-- we need tax money.

00:33:44.990 --> 00:33:47.980 align:middle line:84%
So if we just go attack
them, we know that there's

00:33:47.980 --> 00:33:49.950 align:middle line:90%
money that should be our due.

00:33:49.950 --> 00:33:53.680 align:middle line:84%
But what they wind up doing
is, they alienate Europe.

00:33:53.680 --> 00:33:54.659 align:middle line:90%
They alienate everyone.

00:33:54.659 --> 00:33:56.075 align:middle line:84%
There are these
new laws this that

00:33:56.075 --> 00:34:00.680 align:middle line:84%
just came out, these FATCA,
Foreign Account Compliance,

00:34:00.680 --> 00:34:03.250 align:middle line:84%
where basically, the US
government is telling

00:34:03.250 --> 00:34:05.840 align:middle line:84%
foreign banks around the
world-- if you don't tell us

00:34:05.840 --> 00:34:09.961 align:middle line:84%
what every dollar that
Americans are putting in,

00:34:09.961 --> 00:34:10.960 align:middle line:90%
we're going to find you.

00:34:10.960 --> 00:34:12.756 align:middle line:84%
We're going to lock
you out of our systems.

00:34:12.756 --> 00:34:14.130 align:middle line:84%
So what they're
doing is, they're

00:34:14.130 --> 00:34:17.940 align:middle line:84%
all getting rid of
American customers.

00:34:17.940 --> 00:34:20.199 align:middle line:84%
It's no different
than Obamacare.

00:34:20.199 --> 00:34:22.710 align:middle line:84%
They're saying, if you
don't comply with Obamacare,

00:34:22.710 --> 00:34:23.790 align:middle line:90%
you're going to jail.

00:34:23.790 --> 00:34:24.576 align:middle line:90%
So they say, OK.

00:34:24.576 --> 00:34:26.659 align:middle line:84%
Well, we'll just make
everyone a part time worker,

00:34:26.659 --> 00:34:28.480 align:middle line:84%
so we don't have to
comply with Obamacare.

00:34:28.480 --> 00:34:29.679 align:middle line:90%
It's the exact same thing.

00:34:29.679 --> 00:34:31.790 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So on that note,
where are the people--

00:34:31.790 --> 00:34:34.050 align:middle line:84%
the extraordinarily
wealthy in America--

00:34:34.050 --> 00:34:36.207 align:middle line:84%
hiding their money
now then, if you

00:34:36.207 --> 00:34:38.040 align:middle line:84%
can't go to the foreign
and off-shore banks?

00:34:38.040 --> 00:34:40.081 align:middle line:84%
>>HOFFMAN: If you're the
extraordinarily wealthy,

00:34:40.081 --> 00:34:42.409 align:middle line:84%
you can always lobby your
way into getting breaks.

00:34:42.409 --> 00:34:49.040 align:middle line:84%
But to me, some of it is going
to go into gold inevitably.

00:34:49.040 --> 00:34:52.920 align:middle line:84%
And some of it is going to go--
there are some very complex tax

00:34:52.920 --> 00:34:53.570 align:middle line:90%
shelters.

00:34:53.570 --> 00:34:55.822 align:middle line:84%
But the government is breaking
them down, one by one.

00:34:55.822 --> 00:34:57.780 align:middle line:84%
And that's why I'm saying,
more and more people

00:34:57.780 --> 00:35:00.840 align:middle line:84%
are going to realize-- you have
few choices, very few choices.

00:35:00.840 --> 00:35:03.290 align:middle line:84%
One of them is going
to be gold and silver.

00:35:03.290 --> 00:35:06.070 align:middle line:84%
And any other place you
go around the world,

00:35:06.070 --> 00:35:06.695 align:middle line:90%
you never know.

00:35:06.695 --> 00:35:08.570 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Well now,
aren't there are a number

00:35:08.570 --> 00:35:10.340 align:middle line:84%
of states in the US
that are accepting it

00:35:10.340 --> 00:35:12.410 align:middle line:90%
as a unit of exchange?

00:35:12.410 --> 00:35:13.750 align:middle line:90%
>>HOFFMAN: Well, yeah.

00:35:13.750 --> 00:35:15.000 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: You hear about this.

00:35:15.000 --> 00:35:18.030 align:middle line:84%
>>HOFFMAN: Yeah, I think-- what
was the state, because now I've

00:35:18.030 --> 00:35:19.830 align:middle line:90%
already forgotten-- Utah.

00:35:19.830 --> 00:35:20.480 align:middle line:90%
It makes sense.

00:35:20.480 --> 00:35:21.590 align:middle line:90%
Mormons are smart.

00:35:21.590 --> 00:35:23.090 align:middle line:84%
But the reason that
they're doing it

00:35:23.090 --> 00:35:25.270 align:middle line:90%
is not because they're so--

00:35:25.270 --> 00:35:27.090 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: It's such
an insignificant--

00:35:27.090 --> 00:35:29.130 align:middle line:84%
>>HOFFMAN: They just
want the gold and silver.

00:35:29.130 --> 00:35:30.980 align:middle line:84%
They want to see if
anyone is dumb enough

00:35:30.980 --> 00:35:33.970 align:middle line:84%
to pay their taxes in
gold, instead of dollars.

00:35:33.970 --> 00:35:38.020 align:middle line:84%
Because otherwise, it will have
no impact on-- they're saying,

00:35:38.020 --> 00:35:39.296 align:middle line:90%
well, you can exchange it.

00:35:39.296 --> 00:35:40.420 align:middle line:90%
And we'll give you dollars.

00:35:40.420 --> 00:35:43.520 align:middle line:84%
And there's no taxes
if you exchange it.

00:35:43.520 --> 00:35:46.000 align:middle line:84%
But what they want is someone
dumb enough to do that.

00:35:46.000 --> 00:35:50.600 align:middle line:84%
So the United States government,
or even the Utah government,

00:35:50.600 --> 00:35:52.840 align:middle line:84%
is not going to end
this game on their own.

00:35:52.840 --> 00:35:55.400 align:middle line:84%
It's going to be forced upon
them by the financial markets.

00:35:55.400 --> 00:35:57.510 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:35:57.510 --> 00:35:58.930 align:middle line:84%
Just a moment,
going back again, I

00:35:58.930 --> 00:36:01.100 align:middle line:84%
don't know if you would
have this information.

00:36:01.100 --> 00:36:04.240 align:middle line:84%
But because this is
such a big issue,

00:36:04.240 --> 00:36:07.900 align:middle line:84%
this issue in Switzerland,
this referendum,

00:36:07.900 --> 00:36:11.890 align:middle line:84%
have you heard anything about
the lobbying, the players

00:36:11.890 --> 00:36:13.330 align:middle line:90%
involved in campaigning?

00:36:13.330 --> 00:36:16.020 align:middle line:84%
I would think this would
be a really hot campaign

00:36:16.020 --> 00:36:16.780 align:middle line:90%
in Switzerland.

00:36:16.780 --> 00:36:17.910 align:middle line:90%
>>HOFFMAN: Oh, absolutely.

00:36:17.910 --> 00:36:19.243 align:middle line:90%
What are you hearing about that?

00:36:19.243 --> 00:36:21.670 align:middle line:84%
What are the
arguments, both sides?

00:36:21.670 --> 00:36:23.860 align:middle line:84%
>>HOFFMAN: Well look,
there are two sides.

00:36:23.860 --> 00:36:27.570 align:middle line:84%
The one side, the anti side
is the Swiss National Bank,

00:36:27.570 --> 00:36:29.340 align:middle line:84%
in other words, their
Federal Reserve.

00:36:29.340 --> 00:36:31.210 align:middle line:84%
They desperately want
to maintain power.

00:36:31.210 --> 00:36:34.420 align:middle line:84%
And it's so pathetic, because
the arguments-- they don't even

00:36:34.420 --> 00:36:35.310 align:middle line:90%
make lucid arguments.

00:36:35.310 --> 00:36:40.072 align:middle line:84%
They say, if we have this,
it will reduce our power.

00:36:40.072 --> 00:36:41.530 align:middle line:84%
And the people are
thinking-- yeah,

00:36:41.530 --> 00:36:43.080 align:middle line:84%
but this is why
we proposed this,

00:36:43.080 --> 00:36:46.230 align:middle line:84%
because your power has caused
you to do dumb things like sell

00:36:46.230 --> 00:36:50.160 align:middle line:84%
gold at $500 and peg the
Swiss franc to the euro

00:36:50.160 --> 00:36:51.910 align:middle line:84%
and cause all this
record inflation, which

00:36:51.910 --> 00:36:55.870 align:middle line:84%
makes us have to vote on
minimum wage of $27 an hour.

00:36:55.870 --> 00:36:57.520 align:middle line:84%
So they don't even
have good arguments.

00:36:57.520 --> 00:37:00.110 align:middle line:84%
The argument is we want
to keep the status quo.

00:37:00.110 --> 00:37:00.870 align:middle line:90%
That's it.

00:37:00.870 --> 00:37:03.200 align:middle line:84%
And all the other things
they say are ridiculous.

00:37:03.200 --> 00:37:04.750 align:middle line:90%
But they are very powerful.

00:37:04.750 --> 00:37:07.460 align:middle line:84%
For instance, there's a
guy named Igan Von Greyerz.

00:37:07.460 --> 00:37:12.320 align:middle line:84%
He's a very, very well known
money manager in Switzerland,

00:37:12.320 --> 00:37:13.470 align:middle line:90%
very pro-gold.

00:37:13.470 --> 00:37:16.400 align:middle line:84%
And he's kind of become the de
facto leader of this movement.

00:37:16.400 --> 00:37:18.180 align:middle line:84%
And he had this
Paypal account set up,

00:37:18.180 --> 00:37:20.850 align:middle line:84%
where people from around the
world can contribute to it,

00:37:20.850 --> 00:37:24.190 align:middle line:84%
so they can put up more
billboards and publicity.

00:37:24.190 --> 00:37:26.540 align:middle line:90%
And somehow, it just got frozen.

00:37:26.540 --> 00:37:29.197 align:middle line:84%
I mean, these are the kind
of things that they do.

00:37:29.197 --> 00:37:30.780 align:middle line:84%
They go to Paypal
and say, you are not

00:37:30.780 --> 00:37:33.060 align:middle line:84%
going to accept
people's money for this.

00:37:33.060 --> 00:37:34.280 align:middle line:90%
So that's that.

00:37:34.280 --> 00:37:36.470 align:middle line:90%
And you'll see.

00:37:36.470 --> 00:37:40.060 align:middle line:84%
Within Switzerland though,
how much can you possibly do?

00:37:40.060 --> 00:37:44.880 align:middle line:84%
They give speeches, with
giving pretty pathetic excuses.

00:37:44.880 --> 00:37:46.640 align:middle line:84%
And then the pro-gold
give speeches

00:37:46.640 --> 00:37:48.970 align:middle line:90%
giving very viable excuses.

00:37:48.970 --> 00:37:51.420 align:middle line:84%
And it really comes down
to what the people believe.

00:37:51.420 --> 00:37:54.076 align:middle line:84%
Because you can always
make people believe

00:37:54.076 --> 00:37:55.950 align:middle line:84%
that with gold-- you'll
say, well, with gold,

00:37:55.950 --> 00:37:57.950 align:middle line:84%
it's going to restrict
our ability to grow.

00:37:57.950 --> 00:38:00.280 align:middle line:84%
And it's going to restrict
our ability to give you

00:38:00.280 --> 00:38:02.390 align:middle line:90%
handouts-- you know, wink wink.

00:38:02.390 --> 00:38:04.950 align:middle line:90%
So we'll see what people do.

00:38:04.950 --> 00:38:07.740 align:middle line:84%
And you're seeing right now--
some of the massive market

00:38:07.740 --> 00:38:10.537 align:middle line:84%
manipulation of the last
month is related to this.

00:38:10.537 --> 00:38:12.745 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: The prices of gold
and silver have crashed.

00:38:12.745 --> 00:38:13.870 align:middle line:90%
>>HOFFMAN: Can you imagine?

00:38:13.870 --> 00:38:17.940 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And so it's crashed
just as we supposedly ended QE3

00:38:17.940 --> 00:38:21.770 align:middle line:84%
and just as the election is
happening-- boom, a big slide.

00:38:21.770 --> 00:38:22.700 align:middle line:90%
What's that about?

00:38:22.700 --> 00:38:23.840 align:middle line:90%
Why?

00:38:23.840 --> 00:38:25.480 align:middle line:84%
Why would whoever
is manipulating

00:38:25.480 --> 00:38:27.340 align:middle line:84%
it do that at this
particular time?

00:38:27.340 --> 00:38:28.220 align:middle line:84%
>>HOFFMAN: Well, it's
the US government.

00:38:28.220 --> 00:38:29.469 align:middle line:90%
We say, who's manipulating it?

00:38:29.469 --> 00:38:30.580 align:middle line:90%
Yeah, they have partners.

00:38:30.580 --> 00:38:34.230 align:middle line:84%
They work with the big banks,
the too big to fail banks.

00:38:34.230 --> 00:38:36.790 align:middle line:84%
And the Federal Reserve, as we
said, as Alan Greenspan just

00:38:36.790 --> 00:38:38.850 align:middle line:84%
admitted, that they're
not independent

00:38:38.850 --> 00:38:40.850 align:middle line:84%
of the federal government--
it's the government.

00:38:40.850 --> 00:38:44.940 align:middle line:84%
The US has the most to
lose, the US government.

00:38:44.940 --> 00:38:46.570 align:middle line:84%
And they also have
the best tools.

00:38:46.570 --> 00:38:49.030 align:middle line:84%
They have the best financial
weapons of mass destruction.

00:38:49.030 --> 00:38:50.696 align:middle line:84%
They have the best
derivatives, the best

00:38:50.696 --> 00:38:52.020 align:middle line:90%
high-frequency algorithms.

00:38:52.020 --> 00:38:55.050 align:middle line:84%
They have all these
things that they can do.

00:38:55.050 --> 00:38:56.600 align:middle line:90%
And yes.

00:38:56.600 --> 00:38:59.550 align:middle line:84%
Look, this is not
only the biggest time

00:38:59.550 --> 00:39:01.690 align:middle line:84%
of year for physical gold
buying around the world.

00:39:01.690 --> 00:39:02.940 align:middle line:90%
And believe me, we've seen it.

00:39:02.940 --> 00:39:05.530 align:middle line:84%
There's been absolutely
record demand.

00:39:05.530 --> 00:39:08.620 align:middle line:84%
2013 was a record year for
both physical gold and silver

00:39:08.620 --> 00:39:09.120 align:middle line:90%
demand.

00:39:09.120 --> 00:39:11.950 align:middle line:84%
2014 is already on
a pace to beat that.

00:39:11.950 --> 00:39:13.840 align:middle line:84%
And October is your
busiest time of year.

00:39:13.840 --> 00:39:15.006 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: And it's crashing.

00:39:15.006 --> 00:39:16.810 align:middle line:84%
>>HOFFMAN: So you've
had the FORMIC

00:39:16.810 --> 00:39:18.870 align:middle line:84%
decision, with the
whole QE, which

00:39:18.870 --> 00:39:21.840 align:middle line:90%
is kind very disingenuous.

00:39:21.840 --> 00:39:25.160 align:middle line:84%
But more importantly, the
ECB just started their QE.

00:39:25.160 --> 00:39:28.390 align:middle line:84%
The Bank of Japan just
announced this crazy QE.

00:39:28.390 --> 00:39:30.190 align:middle line:84%
So it's not like money
printing has ended.

00:39:30.190 --> 00:39:31.780 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And yet,
last week, Bernanke

00:39:31.780 --> 00:39:34.612 align:middle line:84%
said that it was an
absolute, utter failure.

00:39:34.612 --> 00:39:36.070 align:middle line:84%
>>HOFFMAN: No,
Greenspan said that.

00:39:36.070 --> 00:39:36.690 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Greenspan said it.

00:39:36.690 --> 00:39:37.560 align:middle line:90%
I though it was Bernanke.

00:39:37.560 --> 00:39:38.280 align:middle line:90%
Or was it Greenspan?

00:39:38.280 --> 00:39:39.550 align:middle line:84%
>>HOFFMAN: No, Bernanke
has been out of the office

00:39:39.550 --> 00:39:40.605 align:middle line:90%
not long enough.

00:39:40.605 --> 00:39:42.210 align:middle line:84%
Greenspan is doing
it because he's

00:39:42.210 --> 00:39:43.570 align:middle line:90%
trying to whitewash his legacy.

00:39:43.570 --> 00:39:45.040 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: The Council on
Foreign Relations chat--

00:39:45.040 --> 00:39:45.664 align:middle line:90%
>>HOFFMAN: Yes.

00:39:45.664 --> 00:39:47.370 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: OK, he
said it didn't work.

00:39:47.370 --> 00:39:48.100 align:middle line:90%
It's not working.

00:39:48.100 --> 00:39:50.890 align:middle line:84%
>>HOFFMAN: Yes, Greenspan
to me and people

00:39:50.890 --> 00:39:53.090 align:middle line:84%
who understand
about him-- he was

00:39:53.090 --> 00:39:54.610 align:middle line:90%
one of the true gold advocates.

00:39:54.610 --> 00:39:58.150 align:middle line:84%
He wrote a piece in 1966 called
"Golden Economic Freedom."

00:39:58.150 --> 00:40:01.060 align:middle line:84%
His mentor was Ayn
Rand, of all people,

00:40:01.060 --> 00:40:03.880 align:middle line:84%
literally the most pro-gold
person in the world.

00:40:03.880 --> 00:40:06.430 align:middle line:84%
But he sold his soul
for power in Washington,

00:40:06.430 --> 00:40:10.080 align:middle line:84%
as all politicians do,
as Ben Bernanke did,

00:40:10.080 --> 00:40:11.460 align:middle line:90%
as Janet Yellen did.

00:40:11.460 --> 00:40:15.910 align:middle line:84%
And now, to me, he's
more responsible

00:40:15.910 --> 00:40:18.980 align:middle line:84%
than any single person on the
planet for what is happening

00:40:18.980 --> 00:40:21.020 align:middle line:90%
right now-- Alan Greenspan.

00:40:21.020 --> 00:40:24.020 align:middle line:84%
And so in his old age, he's
trying to subtly whitewash

00:40:24.020 --> 00:40:25.654 align:middle line:90%
his legacy and say, yeah--

00:40:25.654 --> 00:40:26.820 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: He was very clear.

00:40:26.820 --> 00:40:29.207 align:middle line:84%
It's a failure, QE, the
whole Quantitative Easing

00:40:29.207 --> 00:40:30.040 align:middle line:90%
program is a failure

00:40:30.040 --> 00:40:32.990 align:middle line:84%
>>HOFFMAN: Yeah, he did it
in a very different way.

00:40:32.990 --> 00:40:36.940 align:middle line:84%
And the Ponzi scheme was at
a far less advanced stage

00:40:36.940 --> 00:40:37.850 align:middle line:90%
when he did it.

00:40:37.850 --> 00:40:41.180 align:middle line:84%
So it didn't have the
same near-term impact

00:40:41.180 --> 00:40:42.090 align:middle line:90%
as it's having now.

00:40:42.090 --> 00:40:44.945 align:middle line:84%
So he didn't have to do it
the way they're doing it now.

00:40:44.945 --> 00:40:47.070 align:middle line:84%
So he could say, oh, yeah,
I wouldn't have done QE.

00:40:47.070 --> 00:40:49.370 align:middle line:84%
Well of course you would
have, if you were there now.

00:40:49.370 --> 00:40:50.411 align:middle line:90%
But you did other things.

00:40:50.411 --> 00:40:52.730 align:middle line:84%
You lowered interest
rates to nothing right

00:40:52.730 --> 00:40:55.460 align:middle line:84%
after 1987, right
after 2000, 2001.

00:40:55.460 --> 00:40:57.730 align:middle line:90%
He did all the same things.

00:40:57.730 --> 00:41:00.710 align:middle line:84%
And it's just that--
again, we were talking

00:41:00.710 --> 00:41:02.910 align:middle line:84%
before about the
economy is so bad,

00:41:02.910 --> 00:41:05.590 align:middle line:84%
but people don't look at what
Obama inherited from Bush--

00:41:05.590 --> 00:41:07.340 align:middle line:84%
yeah, and what Bush
inherited from Clinton

00:41:07.340 --> 00:41:10.000 align:middle line:84%
and what Clinton inherited from
Reagan and Bush and et cetera.

00:41:10.000 --> 00:41:10.310 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Exactly.

00:41:10.310 --> 00:41:12.351 align:middle line:84%
>>HOFFMAN: It's a Ponzi
scheme that grows larger.

00:41:12.351 --> 00:41:15.400 align:middle line:84%
And all Greenspan is doing
is simply trying to whitewash

00:41:15.400 --> 00:41:18.450 align:middle line:84%
his legacy, throw in things
about you should own gold.

00:41:18.450 --> 00:41:20.886 align:middle line:84%
Because one day, it'll
break this cartel.

00:41:20.886 --> 00:41:21.885 align:middle line:90%
It will be astronomical.

00:41:21.885 --> 00:41:23.380 align:middle line:84%
And I'll say, see,
I said to do it.

00:41:23.380 --> 00:41:24.916 align:middle line:90%
And look what I said in 1966.

00:41:24.916 --> 00:41:26.000 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:41:26.000 --> 00:41:26.544 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:41:26.544 --> 00:41:28.460 align:middle line:84%
>>HOFFMAN: But again,
the more important thing

00:41:28.460 --> 00:41:32.310 align:middle line:84%
was that he admitted that
the Fed was not independent,

00:41:32.310 --> 00:41:34.160 align:middle line:84%
which is what I've
been saying all along.

00:41:34.160 --> 00:41:35.620 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:41:35.620 --> 00:41:37.990 align:middle line:84%
So there are a couple
things going on here

00:41:37.990 --> 00:41:41.360 align:middle line:84%
that-- we're going to talk
GDP, which we have done before.

00:41:41.360 --> 00:41:44.080 align:middle line:84%
And you have a very
different explanation

00:41:44.080 --> 00:41:47.747 align:middle line:84%
than we would normally see
through the mainstream media.

00:41:47.747 --> 00:41:50.730 align:middle line:84%
So I'm just going
from some stats

00:41:50.730 --> 00:41:54.940 align:middle line:84%
now, because this is one of rays
of sunshine coming through, is

00:41:54.940 --> 00:41:56.490 align:middle line:90%
the GDP.

00:41:56.490 --> 00:42:00.770 align:middle line:84%
So the first quarter of 2014
was supposedly 2.1% growth,

00:42:00.770 --> 00:42:02.630 align:middle line:84%
followed by the
second quarter doubled

00:42:02.630 --> 00:42:08.130 align:middle line:84%
to 4.6% and an average of, thus
far, about 3.5% for the year.

00:42:08.130 --> 00:42:09.870 align:middle line:84%
That would
theoretically, according

00:42:09.870 --> 00:42:12.790 align:middle line:84%
to the reports I've read,
mean the best performance

00:42:12.790 --> 00:42:14.774 align:middle line:90%
in the GDP for 10 years.

00:42:14.774 --> 00:42:16.940 align:middle line:84%
>>HOFFMAN: Well, that would
be true, except it's not

00:42:16.940 --> 00:42:18.180 align:middle line:90%
an increase of 2.1%.

00:42:18.180 --> 00:42:20.486 align:middle line:84%
It was a decrease of 2.1%
in the first quarter.

00:42:20.486 --> 00:42:21.610 align:middle line:90%
So let's start right there.

00:42:21.610 --> 00:42:23.070 align:middle line:84%
Remember, the
first quarter, they

00:42:23.070 --> 00:42:27.580 align:middle line:84%
blamed that negative GDP on
the weather, which is comical,

00:42:27.580 --> 00:42:29.790 align:middle line:84%
because I did all
kinds of work showing

00:42:29.790 --> 00:42:33.380 align:middle line:84%
that the weather actually
was no different on average

00:42:33.380 --> 00:42:36.000 align:middle line:84%
than the weather has been
in any first quarter.

00:42:36.000 --> 00:42:39.520 align:middle line:84%
And actually, if you look at
the real numbers, the problem--

00:42:39.520 --> 00:42:43.220 align:middle line:84%
it's not that there were
more flight cancellations.

00:42:43.220 --> 00:42:46.060 align:middle line:84%
It's that there's less flights,
because there's less business

00:42:46.060 --> 00:42:46.560 align:middle line:90%
travel.

00:42:46.560 --> 00:42:51.110 align:middle line:84%
There's less passenger
travel going on right now.

00:42:51.110 --> 00:42:54.180 align:middle line:84%
So again, we started the first
year, that was the excuse.

00:42:54.180 --> 00:42:55.100 align:middle line:90%
It was the weather.

00:42:55.100 --> 00:42:58.560 align:middle line:84%
The second quarter,
they said, it was 4.5%.

00:42:58.560 --> 00:43:00.840 align:middle line:84%
But in my blog
every day-- I write

00:43:00.840 --> 00:43:04.050 align:middle line:84%
every day-- I was showing
how all the real numbers were

00:43:04.050 --> 00:43:06.045 align:middle line:90%
completely dead-on flat.

00:43:06.045 --> 00:43:08.512 align:middle line:84%
Whether it's the durable
goods, factory orders,

00:43:08.512 --> 00:43:09.970 align:middle line:84%
industrial production,
you name it.

00:43:09.970 --> 00:43:12.200 align:middle line:84%
Everything was flat
with the first quarter.

00:43:12.200 --> 00:43:15.417 align:middle line:84%
And yet, they come out
and say, it was 4.5%.

00:43:15.417 --> 00:43:17.000 align:middle line:84%
And then, of course,
the third quarter

00:43:17.000 --> 00:43:21.030 align:middle line:84%
here, it was boosted by
almost an entire percent

00:43:21.030 --> 00:43:26.210 align:middle line:84%
by government defense spending,
mostly for bombing ISIS.

00:43:26.210 --> 00:43:27.070 align:middle line:90%
I'm serious.

00:43:27.070 --> 00:43:28.590 align:middle line:84%
And then they hype, and
they say this is good.

00:43:28.590 --> 00:43:29.339 align:middle line:90%
No, it's not good.

00:43:29.339 --> 00:43:30.900 align:middle line:84%
They printed money,
created new debt,

00:43:30.900 --> 00:43:34.060 align:middle line:84%
so that we could bomb people,
kill them, and create enemies

00:43:34.060 --> 00:43:36.544 align:middle line:90%
that don't produce anything.

00:43:36.544 --> 00:43:38.210 align:middle line:84%
And then people forget
that a year ago--

00:43:38.210 --> 00:43:40.390 align:middle line:84%
All these numbers, by the
way, are apples to oranges,

00:43:40.390 --> 00:43:42.385 align:middle line:84%
because of the way they
changed the calculation of GDP.

00:43:42.385 --> 00:43:44.050 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And that's what
I wanted you to explain,

00:43:44.050 --> 00:43:45.310 align:middle line:90%
because you did once before.

00:43:45.310 --> 00:43:47.270 align:middle line:84%
But for whoever didn't
see the last interview,

00:43:47.270 --> 00:43:48.070 align:middle line:84%
it's important to know
what GDP really is.

00:43:48.070 --> 00:43:50.780 align:middle line:10%
>>HOFFMAN: GDP, first of
all, is as arbitrary a number

00:43:50.780 --> 00:43:51.810 align:middle line:10%
as you're going to get.

00:43:51.810 --> 00:43:54.070 align:middle line:10%
Just to the average
person, does anyone really

00:43:54.070 --> 00:43:57.570 align:middle line:10%
believe you can measure the
output of a nation of 300

00:43:57.570 --> 00:44:01.900 align:middle line:10%
million people, precisely
to the point percent?

00:44:01.900 --> 00:44:04.760 align:middle line:84%
A lot of these numbers,
first of all, are estimated.

00:44:04.760 --> 00:44:06.800 align:middle line:84%
The same goes with the
unemployment reports,

00:44:06.800 --> 00:44:08.720 align:middle line:90%
all these things-- estimated.

00:44:08.720 --> 00:44:11.220 align:middle line:84%
And they're using the seasonal
adjustments, which are always

00:44:11.220 --> 00:44:13.780 align:middle line:84%
positive, and becoming
more positive to make

00:44:13.780 --> 00:44:14.890 align:middle line:90%
things look better.

00:44:14.890 --> 00:44:17.220 align:middle line:84%
And then, of course,
the GDP is actually

00:44:17.220 --> 00:44:19.290 align:middle line:84%
what they put out
as real GDP, which

00:44:19.290 --> 00:44:23.040 align:middle line:84%
means the nominal number less
an arbitrary inflation number.

00:44:23.040 --> 00:44:26.620 align:middle line:84%
And right now, they're using
1% as their inflation number,

00:44:26.620 --> 00:44:28.580 align:middle line:84%
when we know that the
average cost of living

00:44:28.580 --> 00:44:30.610 align:middle line:90%
is going up closer to 5% to 10%.

00:44:30.610 --> 00:44:33.520 align:middle line:84%
So on a real basis, it's
been negative all along.

00:44:33.520 --> 00:44:35.910 align:middle line:84%
It's very, very
negative right now,

00:44:35.910 --> 00:44:39.370 align:middle line:84%
as are real interest rates,
because the real inflation

00:44:39.370 --> 00:44:42.630 align:middle line:84%
rate is so much higher
than people say.

00:44:42.630 --> 00:44:46.835 align:middle line:84%
But also, they've changed the
calculations of GDP, not just

00:44:46.835 --> 00:44:48.710 align:middle line:84%
here, but everywhere in
the last year or two,

00:44:48.710 --> 00:44:49.830 align:middle line:90%
to make it look bigger.

00:44:49.830 --> 00:44:52.060 align:middle line:90%
Here, we've added royalties.

00:44:52.060 --> 00:44:53.029 align:middle line:90%
We've added goodwill.

00:44:53.029 --> 00:44:55.070 align:middle line:84%
We've added research and
development that doesn't

00:44:55.070 --> 00:44:56.540 align:middle line:90%
actually produce anything.

00:44:56.540 --> 00:44:59.660 align:middle line:84%
In Italy and France they've
added prostitution and drug

00:44:59.660 --> 00:45:02.290 align:middle line:84%
dealing, just to make it
look bigger and to say,

00:45:02.290 --> 00:45:03.940 align:middle line:90%
it's bigger than it was before.

00:45:03.940 --> 00:45:10.750 align:middle line:84%
So again, between GDP,
inflation, and unemployment

00:45:10.750 --> 00:45:13.080 align:middle line:84%
or employment, these
are three of the most

00:45:13.080 --> 00:45:14.460 align:middle line:90%
rigged of all the data.

00:45:14.460 --> 00:45:18.090 align:middle line:84%
And like I said, when you
look at the real data--

00:45:18.090 --> 00:45:19.970 align:middle line:84%
industrial production,
retail sales,

00:45:19.970 --> 00:45:21.910 align:middle line:84%
durable goods, factory
orders, which again,

00:45:21.910 --> 00:45:23.350 align:middle line:90%
also difficult to measure.

00:45:23.350 --> 00:45:24.680 align:middle line:90%
But they're real numbers.

00:45:24.680 --> 00:45:28.370 align:middle line:84%
All of those are screaming
recession, as are,

00:45:28.370 --> 00:45:31.530 align:middle line:84%
if you look real, for instance,
the labor participation rate.

00:45:31.530 --> 00:45:34.220 align:middle line:84%
The real employment rate,
the under-employment rate,

00:45:34.220 --> 00:45:36.720 align:middle line:84%
that number is as bad
as it's been, here

00:45:36.720 --> 00:45:39.366 align:middle line:84%
and around the world,
in our lifetimes.

00:45:39.366 --> 00:45:41.500 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: It's just
so bizarre that we're

00:45:41.500 --> 00:45:46.540 align:middle line:84%
living in this, essentially,
totally artificial construct,

00:45:46.540 --> 00:45:49.990 align:middle line:84%
that our lives are
so deeply pinned to.

00:45:49.990 --> 00:45:52.920 align:middle line:84%
Yet, everything we're
being told is false.

00:45:52.920 --> 00:45:56.450 align:middle line:84%
All the numbers we're
being told are false.

00:45:56.450 --> 00:45:59.740 align:middle line:84%
This is very difficult for human
beings to navigate through.

00:45:59.740 --> 00:46:02.200 align:middle line:90%
Talk about cognitive dissonance.

00:46:02.200 --> 00:46:05.590 align:middle line:84%
>>HOFFMAN: Well, the thing is
that-- again, two years ago,

00:46:05.590 --> 00:46:11.420 align:middle line:84%
a perfect example is that the
Senate and the House elections,

00:46:11.420 --> 00:46:15.040 align:middle line:84%
people still, in some way,
believed that it mattered.

00:46:15.040 --> 00:46:18.740 align:middle line:84%
In fact, I have some friends
who are really into Fox News,

00:46:18.740 --> 00:46:19.620 align:middle line:90%
for instance.

00:46:19.620 --> 00:46:21.890 align:middle line:84%
I don't even hear them
ever talk about it anymore.

00:46:21.890 --> 00:46:24.280 align:middle line:84%
I don't think people
really care anymore.

00:46:24.280 --> 00:46:26.890 align:middle line:84%
They're so focused on
the difficulty of getting

00:46:26.890 --> 00:46:28.030 align:middle line:90%
by on a day-to-day basis.

00:46:28.030 --> 00:46:29.940 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:46:29.940 --> 00:46:32.700 align:middle line:84%
>>HOFFMAN: I say,
the Fox-- people who

00:46:32.700 --> 00:46:34.720 align:middle line:84%
are into that kind
of thing, they

00:46:34.720 --> 00:46:38.630 align:middle line:84%
wanted to believe that all
the problem was-- if we just

00:46:38.630 --> 00:46:41.169 align:middle line:84%
got Republicans in
power, it would change.

00:46:41.169 --> 00:46:42.960 align:middle line:84%
But now they're realizing
that it's nothing

00:46:42.960 --> 00:46:44.680 align:middle line:90%
to do with who's in power.

00:46:44.680 --> 00:46:46.500 align:middle line:90%
They're all the same right now.

00:46:46.500 --> 00:46:48.830 align:middle line:84%
So from a Wall
Street perspective,

00:46:48.830 --> 00:46:50.590 align:middle line:84%
yeah, there's
cognitive dissonance.

00:46:50.590 --> 00:46:53.250 align:middle line:84%
They've got to justify
to their investors

00:46:53.250 --> 00:46:56.120 align:middle line:84%
why they'd be investing
in stocks at all time

00:46:56.120 --> 00:46:59.760 align:middle line:84%
high valuations above $2,000
with the worst economy.

00:46:59.760 --> 00:47:01.540 align:middle line:84%
But for the average
person, they just

00:47:01.540 --> 00:47:03.747 align:middle line:84%
look at-- if they're
even looking anymore.

00:47:03.747 --> 00:47:06.080 align:middle line:84%
I mean, you look at the ratings
for the mainstream news.

00:47:06.080 --> 00:47:07.400 align:middle line:90%
They're plummeting.

00:47:07.400 --> 00:47:09.950 align:middle line:84%
If they're even looking anymore,
they're going, GDP is up.

00:47:09.950 --> 00:47:11.226 align:middle line:90%
Really?

00:47:11.226 --> 00:47:12.350 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Employment is up.

00:47:12.350 --> 00:47:13.516 align:middle line:90%
>>HOFFMAN: Employment is up.

00:47:13.516 --> 00:47:15.390 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: The market is up.

00:47:15.390 --> 00:47:18.740 align:middle line:84%
>>HOFFMAN: It's like we were
talking before this interview

00:47:18.740 --> 00:47:19.310 align:middle line:90%
about.

00:47:19.310 --> 00:47:22.430 align:middle line:84%
I went to Best Buy this weekend,
both Saturday and Sunday,

00:47:22.430 --> 00:47:25.940 align:middle line:84%
because they screwed up
my order on Saturday.

00:47:25.940 --> 00:47:27.420 align:middle line:90%
There was no one there.

00:47:27.420 --> 00:47:30.750 align:middle line:84%
I remember, a couple years ago,
you couldn't get a salesman

00:47:30.750 --> 00:47:31.930 align:middle line:90%
to help you on a Saturday.

00:47:31.930 --> 00:47:33.020 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Very true.

00:47:33.020 --> 00:47:35.230 align:middle line:84%
>>HOFFMAN: And it was like
that Saturday and Sunday.

00:47:35.230 --> 00:47:38.750 align:middle line:84%
So again, the
cognitive dissonance--

00:47:38.750 --> 00:47:41.400 align:middle line:84%
I've said for a long time
now, all the powers that

00:47:41.400 --> 00:47:44.820 align:middle line:84%
be, as I call them, have left
are propaganda, money printing,

00:47:44.820 --> 00:47:46.141 align:middle line:90%
and market manipulation.

00:47:46.141 --> 00:47:47.890 align:middle line:84%
But the propaganda is
not working anymore,

00:47:47.890 --> 00:47:50.487 align:middle line:84%
because no one believes anymore
that the economy is great.

00:47:50.487 --> 00:47:52.570 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Mostly they don't
But still, I see this.

00:47:52.570 --> 00:47:55.190 align:middle line:84%
I think the younger
generation, because they really

00:47:55.190 --> 00:47:57.630 align:middle line:84%
grew up in the midst of this,
the people in their 20s,

00:47:57.630 --> 00:48:01.229 align:middle line:84%
for example, and younger,
for them, the fact

00:48:01.229 --> 00:48:02.520 align:middle line:90%
that there aren't enough jobs--

00:48:02.520 --> 00:48:04.090 align:middle line:84%
>>HOFFMAN: Well, they know
full well, absolutely.

00:48:04.090 --> 00:48:05.330 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: They know full
well what's going on.

00:48:05.330 --> 00:48:06.660 align:middle line:84%
They're finding
their ways around it

00:48:06.660 --> 00:48:08.034 align:middle line:84%
or dropping out
and smoking weed.

00:48:08.034 --> 00:48:09.930 align:middle line:84%
They're doing what they
have to do to contend

00:48:09.930 --> 00:48:11.360 align:middle line:90%
with a bad situation.

00:48:11.360 --> 00:48:13.550 align:middle line:84%
But for those who've
been in the market

00:48:13.550 --> 00:48:14.980 align:middle line:84%
a while, in the
game for a while,

00:48:14.980 --> 00:48:16.840 align:middle line:84%
in general-- in
life for a while--

00:48:16.840 --> 00:48:19.600 align:middle line:84%
this is really
damaging to the psyche.

00:48:19.600 --> 00:48:22.340 align:middle line:84%
Because you hear this,
and you read this.

00:48:22.340 --> 00:48:24.900 align:middle line:84%
And if you watch mainstream
news, for example,

00:48:24.900 --> 00:48:26.385 align:middle line:90%
it's reinforced every day.

00:48:26.385 --> 00:48:27.510 align:middle line:90%
Wow, god, things are great.

00:48:27.510 --> 00:48:28.677 align:middle line:90%
What's wrong with me?

00:48:28.677 --> 00:48:30.260 align:middle line:84%
How come I can't
seem to make it work?

00:48:30.260 --> 00:48:31.330 align:middle line:90%
How come I'm in debt?

00:48:31.330 --> 00:48:33.300 align:middle line:84%
How come my kid
can't find a job?

00:48:33.300 --> 00:48:35.940 align:middle line:84%
And you take it
personally, as though it's

00:48:35.940 --> 00:48:38.205 align:middle line:84%
your personal failure
as a human being.

00:48:38.205 --> 00:48:39.850 align:middle line:84%
>>HOFFMAN: And
also, the messages

00:48:39.850 --> 00:48:41.890 align:middle line:84%
are so mixed,
because believe me--

00:48:41.890 --> 00:48:44.070 align:middle line:84%
and this is what I'm
looking at all day long.

00:48:44.070 --> 00:48:46.980 align:middle line:84%
The mainstream media is not
all saying, things are great.

00:48:46.980 --> 00:48:50.636 align:middle line:84%
And part of it is because they
realize they need ratings.

00:48:50.636 --> 00:48:52.510 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So someone
has to vary the message,

00:48:52.510 --> 00:48:53.718 align:middle line:90%
just to get some market back.

00:48:53.718 --> 00:48:57.480 align:middle line:84%
>>HOFFMAN: You can't just say
all the time, things are great.

00:48:57.480 --> 00:49:00.470 align:middle line:84%
For instance, I look at
Yahoo Finance every day

00:49:00.470 --> 00:49:02.230 align:middle line:90%
to see what their top story is.

00:49:02.230 --> 00:49:05.880 align:middle line:84%
And one day-- for instance,
I saw two articles today

00:49:05.880 --> 00:49:06.900 align:middle line:90%
or in the last two days.

00:49:06.900 --> 00:49:10.520 align:middle line:84%
One said stocks are rising
because oil prices falling.

00:49:10.520 --> 00:49:12.966 align:middle line:84%
And one said stocks falling
because oil price is falling.

00:49:12.966 --> 00:49:14.340 align:middle line:84%
And I'm going,
well, which is it?

00:49:14.340 --> 00:49:16.260 align:middle line:90%
And I see this all the time.

00:49:16.260 --> 00:49:19.046 align:middle line:84%
And one day, it'll
say, "Employment

00:49:19.046 --> 00:49:20.170 align:middle line:90%
is doing better than ever."

00:49:20.170 --> 00:49:22.120 align:middle line:84%
And the next day,
the headline will be,

00:49:22.120 --> 00:49:24.070 align:middle line:84%
"Employment has
never been worse."

00:49:24.070 --> 00:49:26.220 align:middle line:84%
So again, there's a lot
of confusion out there

00:49:26.220 --> 00:49:28.780 align:middle line:84%
that's being caused
by these mixed

00:49:28.780 --> 00:49:32.750 align:middle line:84%
messages of the rigged markets,
of the rigged economic data,

00:49:32.750 --> 00:49:34.780 align:middle line:84%
of what people see
in the real world.

00:49:34.780 --> 00:49:37.350 align:middle line:84%
And yeah, we're talking
about open minds here.

00:49:37.350 --> 00:49:39.900 align:middle line:84%
People are trying to figure
how to navigate through this.

00:49:39.900 --> 00:49:44.390 align:middle line:84%
And the fact is, the best
ways to just focus on reality

00:49:44.390 --> 00:49:46.787 align:middle line:84%
and not focus what
people who have agendas

00:49:46.787 --> 00:49:48.120 align:middle line:90%
are telling you what reality is.

00:49:48.120 --> 00:49:49.200 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Focus on what
you're seeing in the streets.

00:49:49.200 --> 00:49:49.825 align:middle line:90%
>>HOFFMAN: Yes.

00:49:49.825 --> 00:49:53.340 align:middle line:84%
And make your adjustments in
life based on what you see

00:49:53.340 --> 00:49:55.310 align:middle line:84%
and what you feel, not
what they tell you.

00:49:55.310 --> 00:49:57.530 align:middle line:84%
But again, from a
financial situation,

00:49:57.530 --> 00:50:00.149 align:middle line:84%
most people don't have
the means anymore.

00:50:00.149 --> 00:50:02.190 align:middle line:84%
I'm thinking about what
I'm doing in my household

00:50:02.190 --> 00:50:03.730 align:middle line:90%
right now.

00:50:03.730 --> 00:50:06.040 align:middle line:90%
We're going to get smaller cars.

00:50:06.040 --> 00:50:09.600 align:middle line:84%
We're looking at-- is this
gym cheaper than this gym?

00:50:09.600 --> 00:50:12.935 align:middle line:84%
We just got rid of
Comcast and got DirecTV,

00:50:12.935 --> 00:50:13.810 align:middle line:90%
because it's cheaper.

00:50:13.810 --> 00:50:15.480 align:middle line:84%
And I mean, that's
what people are doing.

00:50:15.480 --> 00:50:16.355 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Everywhere.

00:50:16.355 --> 00:50:18.730 align:middle line:84%
And when you hear people
at gatherings-- although,

00:50:18.730 --> 00:50:19.914 align:middle line:90%
I live in Sedona.

00:50:19.914 --> 00:50:21.580 align:middle line:84%
We talk about slightly
different things.

00:50:21.580 --> 00:50:23.660 align:middle line:84%
But every now and
then, I'll be somewhere

00:50:23.660 --> 00:50:28.060 align:middle line:84%
with real people that talk about
things that you would expect.

00:50:28.060 --> 00:50:31.970 align:middle line:84%
And you don't hear the talk of
the '90s and early 2000s at all

00:50:31.970 --> 00:50:33.156 align:middle line:90%
anymore at these events.

00:50:33.156 --> 00:50:34.156 align:middle line:90%
>>HOFFMAN: Or even 2007.

00:50:34.156 --> 00:50:37.700 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Or even 2007--
it's people strategizing.

00:50:37.700 --> 00:50:39.280 align:middle line:84%
I think I'm going
to sell this off.

00:50:39.280 --> 00:50:41.960 align:middle line:84%
I think we're-- like you
said, consolidate this.

00:50:41.960 --> 00:50:45.390 align:middle line:84%
There is none of that big talk
about portfolios that I hear.

00:50:45.390 --> 00:50:47.480 align:middle line:84%
But maybe I don't
travel in elite circles.

00:50:47.480 --> 00:50:48.320 align:middle line:90%
That's for sure.

00:50:48.320 --> 00:50:50.580 align:middle line:84%
>>HOFFMAN: Retail participation
in the stock market

00:50:50.580 --> 00:50:52.990 align:middle line:84%
is as low as it's
been in our lifetime.

00:50:52.990 --> 00:50:56.420 align:middle line:84%
So again, yes, some
people still have 401(k).

00:50:56.420 --> 00:50:59.600 align:middle line:84%
Of course, the 1% have
their big stock portfolios.

00:50:59.600 --> 00:51:02.040 align:middle line:84%
But people just aren't
invested in stocks anymore.

00:51:02.040 --> 00:51:04.432 align:middle line:84%
And they're certainly not
invested in houses anymore,

00:51:04.432 --> 00:51:05.890 align:middle line:84%
because they all
lost their houses.

00:51:05.890 --> 00:51:09.360 align:middle line:84%
And we have record low
mortgage purchase applications,

00:51:09.360 --> 00:51:13.070 align:middle line:84%
record low first-time
buyers, that kind of thing.

00:51:13.070 --> 00:51:17.130 align:middle line:84%
So again, yes, the world is, for
everyone but the top tier, who

00:51:17.130 --> 00:51:19.370 align:middle line:84%
have benefited from all
this money printing,

00:51:19.370 --> 00:51:21.330 align:middle line:84%
the world is changing
for the worse.

00:51:21.330 --> 00:51:23.670 align:middle line:90%
And you see it across the board.

00:51:23.670 --> 00:51:26.320 align:middle line:84%
And I focus more in
the economic side.

00:51:26.320 --> 00:51:29.280 align:middle line:84%
But as you said, you see
it around wherever you are.

00:51:29.280 --> 00:51:32.340 align:middle line:84%
A lot of people
don't want to say it.

00:51:32.340 --> 00:51:35.040 align:middle line:84%
They don't say casually--
if you don't know someone,

00:51:35.040 --> 00:51:37.140 align:middle line:84%
they're not going to say,
yeah, things are bad.

00:51:37.140 --> 00:51:40.710 align:middle line:84%
But you see what
people are doing.

00:51:40.710 --> 00:51:43.430 align:middle line:84%
When Walmart is
saying that our sales

00:51:43.430 --> 00:51:45.670 align:middle line:84%
projections are going to be
a lot lower than we said.

00:51:45.670 --> 00:51:46.920 align:middle line:90%
This is Walmart.

00:51:46.920 --> 00:51:49.640 align:middle line:84%
And you know what one of the
reasons that they gave was?

00:51:49.640 --> 00:51:52.047 align:middle line:84%
Because the government cut
down on food stamps programs.

00:51:52.047 --> 00:51:54.380 align:middle line:84%
And it's funny, because they
don't cut down on anything.

00:51:54.380 --> 00:51:57.450 align:middle line:84%
But they actually did reduce
the food stamps program.

00:51:57.450 --> 00:51:58.220 align:middle line:90%
More people, but--

00:51:58.220 --> 00:52:00.428 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And Walmart would
be particularly affected.

00:52:00.428 --> 00:52:01.310 align:middle line:90%
>>HOFFMAN: Yes, yes.

00:52:01.310 --> 00:52:02.810 align:middle line:84%
And then, of course,
the other thing

00:52:02.810 --> 00:52:05.629 align:middle line:84%
that hurts these companies is
the strong dollar, ironically.

00:52:05.629 --> 00:52:07.670 align:middle line:84%
And that's why all these
currencies are in a race

00:52:07.670 --> 00:52:09.600 align:middle line:84%
to debase their
currencies, because when

00:52:09.600 --> 00:52:12.009 align:middle line:84%
you have a strong
currency, you become less

00:52:12.009 --> 00:52:13.175 align:middle line:90%
internationally competitive.

00:52:13.175 --> 00:52:13.926 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:52:13.926 --> 00:52:15.550 align:middle line:84%
>>HOFFMAN: And so
that's another reason

00:52:15.550 --> 00:52:19.532 align:middle line:84%
why the government will never
allow interest rates to rise.

00:52:19.532 --> 00:52:22.050 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: OK, one more stat
here I wanted to toss out.

00:52:22.050 --> 00:52:28.290 align:middle line:84%
This has to do with the notion
that the deficit under Obama

00:52:28.290 --> 00:52:29.870 align:middle line:90%
has dropped.

00:52:29.870 --> 00:52:31.060 align:middle line:90%
Is that correct?

00:52:31.060 --> 00:52:32.900 align:middle line:84%
What are we talking
about here when

00:52:32.900 --> 00:52:34.410 align:middle line:90%
we're talking about deficits?

00:52:34.410 --> 00:52:37.199 align:middle line:84%
Before, it used to be in a
couple of billion dollars.

00:52:37.199 --> 00:52:38.490 align:middle line:90%
Now, I know even know how many.

00:52:38.490 --> 00:52:41.090 align:middle line:84%
I've lost track, in real
terms, of how many trillions

00:52:41.090 --> 00:52:42.070 align:middle line:90%
of dollars it is.

00:52:42.070 --> 00:52:43.850 align:middle line:90%
First, how much is it?

00:52:43.850 --> 00:52:45.770 align:middle line:90%
And has it truly fallen at all?

00:52:45.770 --> 00:52:47.850 align:middle line:90%
>>HOFFMAN: No.

00:52:47.850 --> 00:52:50.090 align:middle line:84%
This comes up when you
talk about footprints.

00:52:50.090 --> 00:52:53.180 align:middle line:84%
This is a Sasquatch-sized
footprint,

00:52:53.180 --> 00:52:56.510 align:middle line:84%
for Obama or anyone to
have the gall to say

00:52:56.510 --> 00:53:00.180 align:middle line:90%
that the deficit has fallen.

00:53:00.180 --> 00:53:02.130 align:middle line:84%
He said that last
year-- we just finished

00:53:02.130 --> 00:53:05.390 align:middle line:84%
September, 2014 fiscal
year-- that the deficit was

00:53:05.390 --> 00:53:08.160 align:middle line:90%
down to like $580 billion.

00:53:08.160 --> 00:53:10.705 align:middle line:84%
They were proud of
that-- $580 billion.

00:53:10.705 --> 00:53:12.034 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: $580 billion, yes.

00:53:12.034 --> 00:53:14.200 align:middle line:84%
>>HOFFMAN: The problem is,
the national debt went up

00:53:14.200 --> 00:53:16.980 align:middle line:84%
$1.1 trillion, or
twice that amount.

00:53:16.980 --> 00:53:19.290 align:middle line:84%
So he says that
our deficit was X,

00:53:19.290 --> 00:53:21.210 align:middle line:84%
but they actually borrowed
twice that deficit.

00:53:21.210 --> 00:53:23.712 align:middle line:84%
And then the simple
matter is, they've simply

00:53:23.712 --> 00:53:24.670 align:middle line:90%
changed the accounting.

00:53:24.670 --> 00:53:26.900 align:middle line:84%
They call things
off balance sheet.

00:53:26.900 --> 00:53:29.390 align:middle line:84%
So half of the things that
they're spending money

00:53:29.390 --> 00:53:31.720 align:middle line:84%
on-- printing money
and spending on--

00:53:31.720 --> 00:53:35.110 align:middle line:84%
are things that they just
simply say don't matter.

00:53:35.110 --> 00:53:39.190 align:middle line:84%
That's just like saying the CPI
doesn't include food or energy,

00:53:39.190 --> 00:53:41.160 align:middle line:90%
because they're going up.

00:53:41.160 --> 00:53:44.629 align:middle line:84%
Or a lot of these budgets--
wars don't count in the budget.

00:53:44.629 --> 00:53:46.920 align:middle line:84%
So when they come out and
say, our budget for this year

00:53:46.920 --> 00:53:49.380 align:middle line:90%
is $5 trillion dollars.

00:53:49.380 --> 00:53:51.250 align:middle line:84%
Oh, but that doesn't
account for the wars.

00:53:51.250 --> 00:53:54.050 align:middle line:90%
The wars are not official.

00:53:54.050 --> 00:53:55.390 align:middle line:90%
And that's exactly what they do.

00:53:55.390 --> 00:53:59.554 align:middle line:84%
The budget deficit is
as bad as it's been.

00:53:59.554 --> 00:54:00.720 align:middle line:90%
And it's going to get worse.

00:54:00.720 --> 00:54:02.511 align:middle line:84%
Because now, the economy
is getting weaker.

00:54:02.511 --> 00:54:04.630 align:middle line:84%
We're going to have less
tax revenues, of course.

00:54:04.630 --> 00:54:07.450 align:middle line:84%
The only two, quote,
businesses in this country that

00:54:07.450 --> 00:54:12.160 align:middle line:84%
were doing well were
this echo housing bubble,

00:54:12.160 --> 00:54:13.910 align:middle line:84%
which is now falling
apart, and of course,

00:54:13.910 --> 00:54:17.260 align:middle line:84%
shale oil drilling, which is
on the verge of collapsing.

00:54:17.260 --> 00:54:19.780 align:middle line:84%
So again, anything that
they've said was a lie.

00:54:19.780 --> 00:54:21.780 align:middle line:84%
And anything going forward
is going to be worse.

00:54:21.780 --> 00:54:24.624 align:middle line:84%
And then you look at where
the global economy is.

00:54:24.624 --> 00:54:26.290 align:middle line:84%
The global economy,
they're not bashful.

00:54:26.290 --> 00:54:28.480 align:middle line:84%
They're telling us
Europe is in recession.

00:54:28.480 --> 00:54:34.000 align:middle line:84%
Japan is in recession-- a lot
of South America, a lot of Asia.

00:54:34.000 --> 00:54:35.639 align:middle line:84%
They're saying, we
are in recession.

00:54:35.639 --> 00:54:36.680 align:middle line:90%
Things are getting worse.

00:54:36.680 --> 00:54:38.960 align:middle line:84%
That's why the commodity prices
are falling around the world.

00:54:38.960 --> 00:54:40.910 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: You mentioned
that some of the foods

00:54:40.910 --> 00:54:42.000 align:middle line:90%
were falling in prices.

00:54:42.000 --> 00:54:43.160 align:middle line:90%
Which ones specifically?

00:54:43.160 --> 00:54:45.560 align:middle line:84%
>>HOFFMAN: Well, I see,
even the price of rice

00:54:45.560 --> 00:54:46.550 align:middle line:90%
has come down some.

00:54:46.550 --> 00:54:47.104 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: OK.

00:54:47.104 --> 00:54:49.270 align:middle line:84%
>>HOFFMAN: And that's the
major staple of the world.

00:54:49.270 --> 00:54:52.110 align:middle line:84%
Of course, the things
that are impacted

00:54:52.110 --> 00:54:54.920 align:middle line:84%
by these horrific
California and Brazil

00:54:54.920 --> 00:54:56.890 align:middle line:84%
droughts, which are
only getting worse

00:54:56.890 --> 00:54:58.290 align:middle line:90%
and could be catastrophic--

00:54:58.290 --> 00:55:00.930 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Yeah, what can
you tell us about that,

00:55:00.930 --> 00:55:01.820 align:middle line:90%
in terms of any--

00:55:01.820 --> 00:55:03.850 align:middle line:84%
>>HOFFMAN: Well, from
what I'm reading-- again,

00:55:03.850 --> 00:55:06.060 align:middle line:84%
I try to focus on
a lot of things.

00:55:06.060 --> 00:55:09.330 align:middle line:84%
Everyone could see that the
California drought is getting

00:55:09.330 --> 00:55:11.157 align:middle line:90%
worse, anyone in America.

00:55:11.157 --> 00:55:11.990 align:middle line:90%
You see the numbers.

00:55:11.990 --> 00:55:12.899 align:middle line:90%
You see the pictures.

00:55:12.899 --> 00:55:13.690 align:middle line:90%
It's getting worse.

00:55:13.690 --> 00:55:16.750 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Yeah, they
have a huge bond measure

00:55:16.750 --> 00:55:20.610 align:middle line:84%
up for like $60 billion today--
I imagine it'll probably

00:55:20.610 --> 00:55:23.609 align:middle line:84%
be passed-- for more water
innovations, technologies,

00:55:23.609 --> 00:55:24.150 align:middle line:90%
and so forth.

00:55:24.150 --> 00:55:25.149 align:middle line:90%
>>HOFFMAN: That's right.

00:55:25.149 --> 00:55:28.090 align:middle line:84%
Print the money or borrow
the money to get it.

00:55:28.090 --> 00:55:30.340 align:middle line:84%
But again, we're
talking about a third

00:55:30.340 --> 00:55:32.290 align:middle line:84%
to a half of the
produce in this country

00:55:32.290 --> 00:55:34.600 align:middle line:84%
and a lot of the things
people don't realize,

00:55:34.600 --> 00:55:37.310 align:middle line:84%
like milk, that come
out of California.

00:55:37.310 --> 00:55:40.361 align:middle line:84%
And that's why the prices of a
lot of things cannot go down.

00:55:40.361 --> 00:55:42.110 align:middle line:84%
But then people don't
realize that there's

00:55:42.110 --> 00:55:45.110 align:middle line:84%
an equally bad drought going
on in Brazil, where you have--

00:55:45.110 --> 00:55:48.110 align:middle line:84%
it's the biggest cattle
exporter-- soybeans,

00:55:48.110 --> 00:55:49.930 align:middle line:90%
coffee, sugar cane.

00:55:49.930 --> 00:55:50.430 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:55:50.430 --> 00:55:55.040 align:middle line:84%
And in fact, I read last week
that the city of Sao Paulo, 20

00:55:55.040 --> 00:55:57.540 align:middle line:84%
million people, they said,
by the middle of November,

00:55:57.540 --> 00:55:58.915 align:middle line:84%
they're going to
be out of water.

00:55:58.915 --> 00:56:00.910 align:middle line:90%
There's 20 million people there.

00:56:00.910 --> 00:56:03.910 align:middle line:84%
So I don't know how
bad that can be.

00:56:03.910 --> 00:56:06.530 align:middle line:84%
But the fact is, there are
certainly some foods that

00:56:06.530 --> 00:56:08.180 align:middle line:90%
are going nowhere but up.

00:56:08.180 --> 00:56:11.570 align:middle line:84%
But generally speaking,
even some foods

00:56:11.570 --> 00:56:14.120 align:middle line:84%
are being impacted by the
fact that people are spending

00:56:14.120 --> 00:56:16.352 align:middle line:90%
less money around the world.

00:56:16.352 --> 00:56:17.220 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: OK.

00:56:17.220 --> 00:56:19.760 align:middle line:84%
So we've talked
about this before,

00:56:19.760 --> 00:56:22.480 align:middle line:84%
but I think it's always
important to remember

00:56:22.480 --> 00:56:24.200 align:middle line:84%
that there has to
be a silver lining

00:56:24.200 --> 00:56:25.664 align:middle line:90%
of some kind to everything.

00:56:25.664 --> 00:56:27.580 align:middle line:84%
And we've already talked
about gold and silver

00:56:27.580 --> 00:56:31.060 align:middle line:84%
and taking refuge
in commodities that

00:56:31.060 --> 00:56:32.510 align:middle line:90%
have genuine value and such.

00:56:32.510 --> 00:56:34.218 align:middle line:84%
>>HOFFMAN: Right,
silver lining, correct.

00:56:34.218 --> 00:56:35.910 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Silver lining, yes.

00:56:35.910 --> 00:56:41.350 align:middle line:84%
So aside from taking
whatever anyone

00:56:41.350 --> 00:56:44.670 align:middle line:84%
has left by way of
investment monies

00:56:44.670 --> 00:56:46.930 align:middle line:84%
and putting them
there, again, what

00:56:46.930 --> 00:56:50.230 align:middle line:84%
are some of the more
appropriate, practical things

00:56:50.230 --> 00:56:53.820 align:middle line:84%
we can do for ourselves which
now as we can see and go along.

00:56:53.820 --> 00:56:56.720 align:middle line:84%
Because I've been bringing
this up for seven years--

00:56:56.720 --> 00:56:59.050 align:middle line:84%
we're seeing there's a
real mental shift that

00:56:59.050 --> 00:57:00.110 align:middle line:90%
has to start occurring.

00:57:00.110 --> 00:57:02.840 align:middle line:84%
Because the way we
once lived, I don't

00:57:02.840 --> 00:57:05.630 align:middle line:84%
see that returning-- the
way we were living, even

00:57:05.630 --> 00:57:08.190 align:middle line:90%
prior to 2007-- anytime soon.

00:57:08.190 --> 00:57:09.050 align:middle line:90%
>>HOFFMAN: Right.

00:57:09.050 --> 00:57:12.620 align:middle line:84%
Well, I focus, obviously,
on the financial side of it.

00:57:12.620 --> 00:57:17.150 align:middle line:84%
And I understand what
we're trying to do here.

00:57:17.150 --> 00:57:19.940 align:middle line:84%
And I try to put
that in my mind.

00:57:19.940 --> 00:57:21.460 align:middle line:84%
The best thing that
people could do

00:57:21.460 --> 00:57:26.260 align:middle line:84%
is just to reduce expectations
if they haven't already

00:57:26.260 --> 00:57:28.120 align:middle line:90%
been reduced.

00:57:28.120 --> 00:57:30.100 align:middle line:84%
Unless you're in that
a elite 1% that's

00:57:30.100 --> 00:57:33.130 align:middle line:84%
lucky enough to have benefited
from all these horrible things

00:57:33.130 --> 00:57:36.650 align:middle line:84%
going on, you've been
sobered up a bit,

00:57:36.650 --> 00:57:42.310 align:middle line:84%
whether it's by market losses,
the labor force, or just

00:57:42.310 --> 00:57:45.490 align:middle line:84%
generally things that
you deal with in life.

00:57:45.490 --> 00:57:47.360 align:middle line:84%
I've brought my
expectations down

00:57:47.360 --> 00:57:49.550 align:middle line:84%
of where I once
thought they could be,

00:57:49.550 --> 00:57:52.900 align:middle line:90%
and it's very liberating.

00:57:52.900 --> 00:57:55.402 align:middle line:84%
It's liberating to think
that I'm thinking now,

00:57:55.402 --> 00:57:57.610 align:middle line:84%
for the first time, of
actually getting a smaller car

00:57:57.610 --> 00:58:00.800 align:middle line:84%
when my lease runs out, for
the first time I've ever had.

00:58:00.800 --> 00:58:03.540 align:middle line:84%
And I think, well, why do I have
to keep getting a bigger car?

00:58:03.540 --> 00:58:04.450 align:middle line:90%
Who cares?

00:58:04.450 --> 00:58:06.960 align:middle line:84%
So that's one way
of looking at it.

00:58:06.960 --> 00:58:11.110 align:middle line:84%
I, of course, focus more on
preparing people financially.

00:58:11.110 --> 00:58:16.850 align:middle line:84%
But to not worry so much
and think that whole mindset

00:58:16.850 --> 00:58:20.380 align:middle line:84%
of the 1990s America or
even that uber bubble

00:58:20.380 --> 00:58:23.417 align:middle line:84%
in the 2000s in real estate,
that that's the way the world,

00:58:23.417 --> 00:58:25.000 align:middle line:84%
because it's not the
way the world is.

00:58:25.000 --> 00:58:27.214 align:middle line:84%
It's not the way the
world is living now.

00:58:27.214 --> 00:58:29.130 align:middle line:84%
And it's not the way the
world has ever lived.

00:58:29.130 --> 00:58:34.192 align:middle line:84%
We've had this very, very
privileged 30 or 40 or 50 years

00:58:34.192 --> 00:58:35.650 align:middle line:84%
here in the United
States, where we

00:58:35.650 --> 00:58:38.280 align:middle line:84%
were taught to believe
that we are invincible.

00:58:38.280 --> 00:58:39.390 align:middle line:90%
But we're not.

00:58:39.390 --> 00:58:42.531 align:middle line:84%
And once you accept that
and act accordingly,

00:58:42.531 --> 00:58:44.030 align:middle line:84%
it makes life a lot
more liberating.

00:58:44.030 --> 00:58:47.100 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: I totally agree with
you, because the beauty of life

00:58:47.100 --> 00:58:49.327 align:middle line:84%
is really in our
relationships with each other.

00:58:49.327 --> 00:58:50.410 align:middle line:90%
It's in the simple things.

00:58:50.410 --> 00:58:52.440 align:middle line:84%
It's about friendship
and spending time

00:58:52.440 --> 00:58:53.857 align:middle line:90%
together and cooking together.

00:58:53.857 --> 00:58:56.440 align:middle line:84%
And to me, those are the things
that give me the greatest joy.

00:58:56.440 --> 00:58:58.750 align:middle line:84%
It's not going on an
inexpensive vacation.

00:58:58.750 --> 00:59:01.210 align:middle line:84%
So if we can just kind
of learn to herd together

00:59:01.210 --> 00:59:03.510 align:middle line:84%
a little bit more again, I
think we can ride it out.

00:59:03.510 --> 00:59:05.010 align:middle line:90%
And I wanted to ask you.

00:59:05.010 --> 00:59:07.010 align:middle line:84%
I don't think I
asked you last time,

00:59:07.010 --> 00:59:09.030 align:middle line:84%
what did you think of
the movie "Wall Street"

00:59:09.030 --> 00:59:10.690 align:middle line:90%
with Leonardo DiCaprio?

00:59:10.690 --> 00:59:12.399 align:middle line:84%
>>HOFFMAN: Oh, the
"Wolf of Wall Street?"

00:59:12.399 --> 00:59:13.731 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: "Wolf of Wall Street."

00:59:13.731 --> 00:59:15.210 align:middle line:90%
What did you think of that?

00:59:15.210 --> 00:59:17.720 align:middle line:84%
>>HOFFMAN: Well, it's funny,
because that company--

00:59:17.720 --> 00:59:19.380 align:middle line:90%
what was the name of it?

00:59:19.380 --> 00:59:21.500 align:middle line:84%
Stratton Oakmont, I
used to deal with them.

00:59:21.500 --> 00:59:23.140 align:middle line:84%
I was on Wall Street
for many years.

00:59:23.140 --> 00:59:26.840 align:middle line:84%
And when the big
IPO boom, before

00:59:26.840 --> 00:59:30.020 align:middle line:84%
this current ridiculous
Alibaba tight one,

00:59:30.020 --> 00:59:31.025 align:middle line:90%
was back in the 1990s.

00:59:31.025 --> 00:59:33.830 align:middle line:84%
And Stratton Oakmont was
one of many small firms

00:59:33.830 --> 00:59:35.070 align:middle line:90%
that we dealt with.

00:59:35.070 --> 00:59:40.270 align:middle line:84%
I had no idea at the time that
they were this crazy scheme.

00:59:40.270 --> 00:59:42.905 align:middle line:90%
I think the movie was horrible.

01:01:28.060 --> 01:01:29.870 align:middle line:84%
I mean, there were
different frauds.

01:01:29.870 --> 01:01:33.520 align:middle line:84%
When I left-- I left
Wall Street in 2005.

01:01:33.520 --> 01:01:36.330 align:middle line:84%
And the big reason that I left--
I was at Solomon Smith Barney.

01:01:36.330 --> 01:01:38.590 align:middle line:84%
And before that, I was
with the buy-side firms

01:01:38.590 --> 01:01:40.050 align:middle line:90%
or the hedge funds.

01:01:40.050 --> 01:01:41.550 align:middle line:84%
But a lot of the
reason I left was

01:01:41.550 --> 01:01:43.890 align:middle line:84%
because of all the abuses
I saw, mostly abuses

01:01:43.890 --> 01:01:45.520 align:middle line:90%
that were conflict of interest.

01:01:45.520 --> 01:01:48.650 align:middle line:84%
I was in research, and I saw
so many conflicts of interest,

01:01:48.650 --> 01:01:50.010 align:middle line:90%
it made it very difficult.

01:01:50.010 --> 01:01:52.220 align:middle line:84%
And yeah, there were penny
stock scams and all that.

01:01:52.220 --> 01:01:54.280 align:middle line:84%

it was bull market.

did, they don't exist.

01:02:02.310 --> 01:02:05.770 align:middle line:10%
all about taking free money from

01:02:05.770 --> 01:02:08.380 align:middle line:10%
trading, high-frequency
trading, and those kind

01:02:08.380 --> 01:02:12.069 align:middle line:10%

do with the abuses of the past.

01:02:53.210 --> 01:02:54.543 align:middle line:90%
>>HOFFMAN: No one can afford it.

01:02:54.543 --> 01:02:55.750 align:middle line:90%
They don't get you any jobs.

01:02:55.750 --> 01:02:56.657 align:middle line:90%
It's a waste of time.

01:02:56.657 --> 01:02:58.490 align:middle line:84%
Do what people have
done throughout history.

01:02:58.490 --> 01:02:59.240 align:middle line:90%
You learn a trade.

01:02:59.240 --> 01:03:00.490 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: I agree.

01:03:00.490 --> 01:03:02.020 align:middle line:90%
I totally agree.

01:03:02.020 --> 01:03:03.950 align:middle line:84%
Well, on that note,
thank you, Andy.

01:03:03.950 --> 01:03:05.770 align:middle line:84%
It's always a pleasure
to kind of catch up.

01:03:05.770 --> 01:03:08.270 align:middle line:84%
It might not be
heartening necessarily,

01:03:08.270 --> 01:03:09.882 align:middle line:84%
but it's always a
pleasure to hear

01:03:09.882 --> 01:03:11.090 align:middle line:90%
a kind of a straight shooter.

01:03:11.090 --> 01:03:11.740 align:middle line:90%
>>HOFFMAN: Thank you.

01:03:11.740 --> 01:03:14.250 align:middle line:84%
I hope I have some heartening
news in the future years.

01:03:14.250 --> 01:03:15.830 align:middle line:84%
But right now, I'm
not so optimistic.

01:03:15.830 --> 01:03:17.750 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Thanks, Andy.

01:03:17.750 --> 01:03:19.750 align:middle line:90%
I'm on overload, total overload.

01:03:19.750 --> 01:03:22.350 align:middle line:10%
But I think we all need to
take at least a look at what's

01:03:22.350 --> 01:03:25.240 align:middle line:10%
going on around us so we can
use our energy and our resources

01:03:25.240 --> 01:03:26.480 align:middle line:10%
wisely from here on out.

01:03:26.480 --> 01:03:29.150 align:middle line:84%
As before, you can
stay up on Andy's blog

01:03:29.150 --> 01:03:31.180 align:middle line:90%
by going to milesfranklin.com.

01:03:31.180 --> 01:03:35.040 align:middle line:84%
Until next time, thank you for
