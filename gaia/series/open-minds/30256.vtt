00:00:20.489 --> 00:00:22.280 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA MEREDITH:
Andrew Harvey is perhaps

00:00:22.280 --> 00:00:25.180 align:middle line:84%
the most passionate human
being I've ever encountered.

00:00:25.180 --> 00:00:29.139 align:middle line:10%
He uses his passion to move
societal lethargy into action.

00:00:29.139 --> 00:00:30.680 align:middle line:10%
Having had the
pleasure of witnessing

00:00:30.680 --> 00:00:33.500 align:middle line:10%
Harvey's presentations in the
past and interviewing him,

00:00:33.500 --> 00:00:36.280 align:middle line:10%
I can say that I have rarely
been as inspired as when

00:00:36.280 --> 00:00:38.860 align:middle line:10%
I'm sitting with Harvey,
which I am today.

00:00:38.860 --> 00:00:41.740 align:middle line:84%
He is with us, and he's
going to help each one of us

00:00:41.740 --> 00:00:45.280 align:middle line:84%
reach inside ourselves to find
our own radical passion, which

00:00:45.280 --> 00:00:46.990 align:middle line:90%
is the title of his new book.

00:00:46.990 --> 00:00:48.907 align:middle line:84%
And I'm so happy to be
sitting with you again.

00:00:48.907 --> 00:00:51.448 align:middle line:84%
>>ANDREW HARVEY: So lovely to
be with you again, Regina, yes.

00:00:51.448 --> 00:00:54.180 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Do you mind if I share
my last encounter with you?

00:00:54.180 --> 00:00:56.330 align:middle line:84%
Because I think it was memorable
for not only both of us--

00:00:56.330 --> 00:00:57.510 align:middle line:90%
>>HARVEY: For both of us, yes.

00:00:57.510 --> 00:00:59.135 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: --but
everyone in attendance.

00:00:59.135 --> 00:00:59.840 align:middle line:90%
So OK.

00:00:59.840 --> 00:01:01.510 align:middle line:84%
So the last time
was in Vancouver.

00:01:01.510 --> 00:01:02.969 align:middle line:84%
I think it was
maybe-- was it 2010?

00:01:02.969 --> 00:01:04.301 align:middle line:90%
>>HARVEY: Three years ago, yeah.

00:01:04.301 --> 00:01:05.214 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: 2010?

00:01:05.214 --> 00:01:06.480 align:middle line:90%
I think it was 2010.

00:01:06.480 --> 00:01:08.080 align:middle line:84%
And you were giving
a presentation

00:01:08.080 --> 00:01:13.030 align:middle line:84%
at one of the premier
conferences, alternative New

00:01:13.030 --> 00:01:14.410 align:middle line:90%
Age conferences.

00:01:14.410 --> 00:01:18.220 align:middle line:84%
And you had been listening to
another high profile individual

00:01:18.220 --> 00:01:19.130 align:middle line:90%
speak.

00:01:19.130 --> 00:01:23.750 align:middle line:84%
And that person was speaking
of a very passive way

00:01:23.750 --> 00:01:26.330 align:middle line:84%
to go into this
transcendent future.

00:01:26.330 --> 00:01:27.170 align:middle line:90%
>>HARVEY: Yeah.

00:01:27.170 --> 00:01:28.510 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Now, you were
sitting in the audience.

00:01:28.510 --> 00:01:29.520 align:middle line:84%
>>HARVEY: That's putting
it mildly, sweetheart.

00:01:29.520 --> 00:01:30.311 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes, yes.

00:01:30.311 --> 00:01:31.345 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:01:31.345 --> 00:01:32.410 align:middle line:90%
I'm not naming names.

00:01:32.410 --> 00:01:32.730 align:middle line:90%
>>HARVEY: No.

00:01:32.730 --> 00:01:34.396 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: The point
is, you were sitting

00:01:34.396 --> 00:01:36.410 align:middle line:90%
behind a row of young men.

00:01:36.410 --> 00:01:38.570 align:middle line:84%
And these young
men, you overheard

00:01:38.570 --> 00:01:42.380 align:middle line:84%
them saying, basically, yeah,
he seems like a nice old guy,

00:01:42.380 --> 00:01:43.510 align:middle line:90%
but this is a crock.

00:01:43.510 --> 00:01:45.620 align:middle line:84%
This isn't giving us
anything we can work with.

00:01:45.620 --> 00:01:48.150 align:middle line:84%
And they were talking
along that line.

00:01:48.150 --> 00:01:50.510 align:middle line:84%
You overheard that,
and you radically

00:01:50.510 --> 00:01:52.040 align:middle line:90%
reinvented your speech.

00:01:52.040 --> 00:01:55.490 align:middle line:84%
And when you got up, you
tore into the audience

00:01:55.490 --> 00:01:59.020 align:middle line:84%
about this passivity that
has to do with transcendence.

00:01:59.020 --> 00:01:59.670 align:middle line:90%
>>HARVEY: Yes.

00:01:59.670 --> 00:02:02.000 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And, I mean,
people were shocked.

00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:03.437 align:middle line:90%
But you had a standing ovation.

00:02:03.437 --> 00:02:04.020 align:middle line:90%
>>HARVEY: Yes.

00:02:04.020 --> 00:02:09.380 align:middle line:10%
It was one of the wildest things
I've ever done because I really

00:02:09.380 --> 00:02:14.230 align:middle line:10%
felt agonized and excruciated
by this distinguished

00:02:14.230 --> 00:02:16.200 align:middle line:10%
person getting up and
telling people basically

00:02:16.200 --> 00:02:17.690 align:middle line:10%
everything is going to be fine.

00:02:17.690 --> 00:02:22.160 align:middle line:84%
All you have to do is to
wait and spaceships from God

00:02:22.160 --> 00:02:24.140 align:middle line:84%
knows where are going
to come and rescue us.

00:02:24.140 --> 00:02:26.130 align:middle line:84%
Anybody who thinks
like that at a time

00:02:26.130 --> 00:02:28.150 align:middle line:84%
when the world has
plunged into what

00:02:28.150 --> 00:02:31.700 align:middle line:84%
could be a terminal
and terrifying crisis

00:02:31.700 --> 00:02:34.550 align:middle line:90%
is really bamboozling people.

00:02:34.550 --> 00:02:37.440 align:middle line:84%
And there's been so much
of that in the new age.

00:02:37.440 --> 00:02:40.340 align:middle line:84%
So much of the flattening
of the situation.

00:02:40.340 --> 00:02:43.430 align:middle line:84%
Don't look at what's
going on because you'll

00:02:43.430 --> 00:02:45.010 align:middle line:90%
feed its darkness.

00:02:45.010 --> 00:02:47.300 align:middle line:84%
You don't have to
actually do anything.

00:02:47.300 --> 00:02:50.960 align:middle line:84%
Just raise your vibrations and
somehow the poor will be fed,

00:02:50.960 --> 00:02:53.400 align:middle line:84%
the forests will stop
being burnt down,

00:02:53.400 --> 00:02:55.980 align:middle line:84%
the seas will just unpolute
themselves overnight.

00:02:55.980 --> 00:02:57.390 align:middle line:90%
This is magical thinking.

00:02:57.390 --> 00:02:58.590 align:middle line:90%
This is garbage.

00:02:58.590 --> 00:03:00.670 align:middle line:90%
This is extremely dangerous.

00:03:00.670 --> 00:03:04.430 align:middle line:84%
Because what I feel, and
what I said very passionately

00:03:04.430 --> 00:03:12.420 align:middle line:84%
that day, was that we are
truly in tremendous danger.

00:03:12.420 --> 00:03:14.760 align:middle line:84%
And there is a way
through, but it

00:03:14.760 --> 00:03:17.830 align:middle line:84%
comes from allowing
ourself to feel

00:03:17.830 --> 00:03:21.130 align:middle line:84%
the depth of the pain of
what we're going through,

00:03:21.130 --> 00:03:24.280 align:middle line:84%
and opening ourself up to
the depth of the possibility

00:03:24.280 --> 00:03:28.650 align:middle line:84%
that grace is holding up to us,
and pushing your whole being

00:03:28.650 --> 00:03:33.240 align:middle line:84%
on the line in sacred
action, with sacred action.

00:03:33.240 --> 00:03:34.520 align:middle line:90%
That's my whole vision.

00:03:34.520 --> 00:03:35.870 align:middle line:90%
And I fought for it that day.

00:03:35.870 --> 00:03:38.200 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And we have so
much to talk about today.

00:03:38.200 --> 00:03:40.970 align:middle line:84%
I mean, in your new
book, Radical Passion,

00:03:40.970 --> 00:03:42.480 align:middle line:84%
you can see that
where I've read,

00:03:42.480 --> 00:03:44.255 align:middle line:84%
I've dog-eared almost
every single page.

00:03:44.255 --> 00:03:45.088 align:middle line:90%
>>HARVEY: Thank you.

00:03:45.088 --> 00:03:47.420 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: I've underlined
very liberally.

00:03:47.420 --> 00:03:49.700 align:middle line:84%
But I want to ask you a
question that I've never

00:03:49.700 --> 00:03:51.470 align:middle line:90%
asked you before.

00:03:51.470 --> 00:03:54.290 align:middle line:84%
Do you think that
what is known as, what

00:03:54.290 --> 00:03:56.490 align:middle line:84%
became known as the
New Age movement,

00:03:56.490 --> 00:04:01.270 align:middle line:84%
was in itself part of an
elite agenda of some kind?

00:04:01.270 --> 00:04:03.720 align:middle line:84%
Or is it a natural
response of wanting

00:04:03.720 --> 00:04:07.131 align:middle line:90%
to simply explore in a new way?

00:04:07.131 --> 00:04:08.630 align:middle line:84%
>>HARVEY: Very
interesting question.

00:04:08.630 --> 00:04:11.440 align:middle line:84%
I think a lot of the people who
were pioneers of the New Age

00:04:11.440 --> 00:04:13.400 align:middle line:90%
were absolutely sincere.

00:04:13.400 --> 00:04:16.920 align:middle line:84%
They truly were making
major breakthroughs

00:04:16.920 --> 00:04:19.779 align:middle line:84%
into an understanding
about innate divinity.

00:04:19.779 --> 00:04:22.690 align:middle line:84%
They were people who brought
the deep wisdom of the East

00:04:22.690 --> 00:04:23.520 align:middle line:90%
to the West.

00:04:23.520 --> 00:04:27.660 align:middle line:84%
But what I think happened
is that the corporations

00:04:27.660 --> 00:04:31.570 align:middle line:84%
saw the possibility of making
an enormous amount of money

00:04:31.570 --> 00:04:33.990 align:middle line:90%
out of spirituality.

00:04:33.990 --> 00:04:36.210 align:middle line:84%
And then they saw
the possibility

00:04:36.210 --> 00:04:40.070 align:middle line:84%
of favoring a particular
kind of spirituality which

00:04:40.070 --> 00:04:43.920 align:middle line:84%
stressed health, and
sweetness, and cheerfulness,

00:04:43.920 --> 00:04:47.740 align:middle line:84%
and always being joyful,
and not looking at the dark.

00:04:47.740 --> 00:04:51.960 align:middle line:84%
And they really put a
lot of money and power

00:04:51.960 --> 00:04:55.230 align:middle line:84%
behind that because that
is what is required now

00:04:55.230 --> 00:04:58.100 align:middle line:84%
for keeping people
passive, and addicted,

00:04:58.100 --> 00:05:01.160 align:middle line:84%
and consumerist while dignifying
that with spirituality.

00:05:01.160 --> 00:05:03.020 align:middle line:84%
And the ultimate
representation of that

00:05:03.020 --> 00:05:05.500 align:middle line:84%
is, for me, "The Secret,"
which is a terrifying film.

00:05:05.500 --> 00:05:06.785 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: The film,
the book, "The Secret."

00:05:06.785 --> 00:05:07.250 align:middle line:90%
>>HARVEY: Yes.

00:05:07.250 --> 00:05:07.430 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Terrifying.

00:05:07.430 --> 00:05:08.960 align:middle line:84%
And tell us why you
think that's terrifying.

00:05:08.960 --> 00:05:11.376 align:middle line:84%
>>HARVEY: Well, it's terrifying
because it's fundamentally

00:05:11.376 --> 00:05:13.390 align:middle line:84%
saying to people
what your ego wants

00:05:13.390 --> 00:05:14.780 align:middle line:90%
is what God wants for you.

00:05:14.780 --> 00:05:17.210 align:middle line:84%
So if you want a
Mercedes, God is only

00:05:17.210 --> 00:05:18.655 align:middle line:90%
trying just to produce that.

00:05:18.655 --> 00:05:22.500 align:middle line:84%
If you want a mansion or
a fabulous Cuban lover,

00:05:22.500 --> 00:05:25.870 align:middle line:84%
that's God's job, is to be
a kind of glorified servant

00:05:25.870 --> 00:05:27.230 align:middle line:90%
who does this this for you.

00:05:27.230 --> 00:05:28.590 align:middle line:90%
This is insanity.

00:05:28.590 --> 00:05:31.330 align:middle line:84%
We're talking about the
creator of the universe,

00:05:31.330 --> 00:05:33.290 align:middle line:84%
and we're talking about
a civilization that

00:05:33.290 --> 00:05:36.400 align:middle line:84%
is killing the
world because it's

00:05:36.400 --> 00:05:39.450 align:middle line:84%
destroying the world
because it isn't

00:05:39.450 --> 00:05:42.290 align:middle line:84%
in a relationship of
sacred truth to the world

00:05:42.290 --> 00:05:44.845 align:middle line:84%
and is addicted to stuff
anyway, which is the problem.

00:05:44.845 --> 00:05:48.550 align:middle line:84%
And here it is, this addiction
being celebrated as holiness.

00:05:48.550 --> 00:05:52.090 align:middle line:84%
So for me, it was a
demonic and terrifying.

00:05:52.090 --> 00:05:54.960 align:middle line:84%
And that was what alerted
me to the way in which--

00:05:54.960 --> 00:05:58.044 align:middle line:84%
it's of course very, very
useful for the corporate agenda,

00:05:58.044 --> 00:05:59.460 align:middle line:84%
for the destruction
of the planet,

00:05:59.460 --> 00:06:02.760 align:middle line:84%
to have a passive
transcendentally-addicted,

00:06:02.760 --> 00:06:07.100 align:middle line:84%
consumerist, materialistic
spirituality that tells

00:06:07.100 --> 00:06:10.620 align:middle line:84%
everybody to be cheerful
and happy while they're busy

00:06:10.620 --> 00:06:13.920 align:middle line:84%
polluting the seas, and
burning down the forests,

00:06:13.920 --> 00:06:16.610 align:middle line:84%
and reducing 2 billion people
to living on less than $1.00

00:06:16.610 --> 00:06:17.110 align:middle line:90%
a day.

00:06:17.110 --> 00:06:19.814 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And because it's
not our truth as a species.

00:06:19.814 --> 00:06:20.480 align:middle line:90%
>>HARVEY: Right.

00:06:20.480 --> 00:06:23.230 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: We're having
to artificially induce

00:06:23.230 --> 00:06:27.530 align:middle line:84%
it, oftentimes through various
mind or mood-altering drugs,

00:06:27.530 --> 00:06:30.150 align:middle line:84%
just to put this in the
happy, peaceful place.

00:06:30.150 --> 00:06:36.630 align:middle line:84%
But you really acknowledge
the need for that stress

00:06:36.630 --> 00:06:39.390 align:middle line:84%
that the natural pain that
occurs within our being

00:06:39.390 --> 00:06:40.142 align:middle line:90%
brings to us.

00:06:40.142 --> 00:06:41.600 align:middle line:84%
>>HARVEY: Well,
it's not just that.

00:06:41.600 --> 00:06:44.590 align:middle line:84%
I think that one of the
most important aspects

00:06:44.590 --> 00:06:49.890 align:middle line:84%
of our divine truth is
that we have hearts.

00:06:49.890 --> 00:06:51.520 align:middle line:90%
And hearts break.

00:06:51.520 --> 00:06:53.440 align:middle line:90%
They break at injustice.

00:06:53.440 --> 00:06:55.450 align:middle line:84%
They break at
cruelty to animals.

00:06:55.450 --> 00:06:58.540 align:middle line:84%
They break at treating
the poor like vermin.

00:06:58.540 --> 00:07:00.900 align:middle line:90%
They break at humiliation.

00:07:00.900 --> 00:07:03.850 align:middle line:84%
They break at the dreadful
public humiliation

00:07:03.850 --> 00:07:05.030 align:middle line:90%
of reality shows.

00:07:05.030 --> 00:07:07.330 align:middle line:84%
They break at the
ghastly treatment

00:07:07.330 --> 00:07:09.330 align:middle line:90%
of homosexuals and women.

00:07:09.330 --> 00:07:12.670 align:middle line:84%
And without acknowledging
that that heartbreak is sacred

00:07:12.670 --> 00:07:15.570 align:middle line:84%
is, in fact, one of the
most sacred parts of us,

00:07:15.570 --> 00:07:17.590 align:middle line:84%
you're really
denaturing human beings.

00:07:17.590 --> 00:07:19.699 align:middle line:84%
You're training them
to become robots.

00:07:19.699 --> 00:07:21.990 align:middle line:84%
And of course, that's what
the corporate machine wants,

00:07:21.990 --> 00:07:22.310 align:middle line:90%
is robots.

00:07:22.310 --> 00:07:24.101 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: It does not
want radical passion.

00:07:24.101 --> 00:07:25.030 align:middle line:90%
>>HARVEY: No.

00:07:25.030 --> 00:07:29.100 align:middle line:84%
Passion is what the
New Age has demonized.

00:07:29.100 --> 00:07:31.100 align:middle line:90%
Passion is what's not allowed.

00:07:31.100 --> 00:07:32.880 align:middle line:84%
You're not supposed
to get passionate

00:07:32.880 --> 00:07:35.880 align:middle line:84%
about the environment,
passionate about injustice.

00:07:35.880 --> 00:07:39.080 align:middle line:84%
You're supposed to see
it as some vague part

00:07:39.080 --> 00:07:41.680 align:middle line:84%
of a massive divine plan which
you have to do nothing about,

00:07:41.680 --> 00:07:43.090 align:middle line:90%
just be passive to.

00:07:43.090 --> 00:07:46.260 align:middle line:84%
It's all going to be done
for you because you're

00:07:46.260 --> 00:07:47.790 align:middle line:84%
so fabulous, and
special, and thin,

00:07:47.790 --> 00:07:49.680 align:middle line:90%
and your vibrations are so high.

00:07:49.680 --> 00:07:51.710 align:middle line:90%
This is insanity.

00:07:51.710 --> 00:07:52.710 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Well, OK.

00:07:52.710 --> 00:07:54.175 align:middle line:90%
I remember the one question--

00:07:54.175 --> 00:07:54.640 align:middle line:90%
>>HARVEY: To put it mildly.

00:07:54.640 --> 00:07:55.225 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: It is insanity.

00:07:55.225 --> 00:07:55.860 align:middle line:90%
>>HARVEY: Yes.

00:07:55.860 --> 00:07:57.443 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: The question
you brought up,

00:07:57.443 --> 00:08:00.260 align:middle line:84%
and you posed to the audience
that day, is just so you said.

00:08:00.260 --> 00:08:03.330 align:middle line:84%
It was, what in all of
the causes in the world

00:08:03.330 --> 00:08:04.397 align:middle line:90%
breaks my heart the most?

00:08:04.397 --> 00:08:04.980 align:middle line:90%
>>HARVEY: Yes.

00:08:04.980 --> 00:08:06.730 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And your
suggestion at that time

00:08:06.730 --> 00:08:08.720 align:middle line:84%
was if that breaks
your heart, you

00:08:08.720 --> 00:08:11.550 align:middle line:84%
have an automatic resonance,
and charge, and passion,

00:08:11.550 --> 00:08:13.580 align:middle line:84%
and heartbreak around
it, put yourself there.

00:08:13.580 --> 00:08:14.710 align:middle line:90%
Do something.

00:08:14.710 --> 00:08:16.370 align:middle line:84%
Get out of your chair
and do something.

00:08:16.370 --> 00:08:16.790 align:middle line:90%
>>HARVEY: Yes.

00:08:16.790 --> 00:08:18.236 align:middle line:84%
When people say
to me, you know--

00:08:18.236 --> 00:08:21.140 align:middle line:84%
I go all over the world talking
about sacred activism, which

00:08:21.140 --> 00:08:22.192 align:middle line:90%
is a term I coined.

00:08:22.192 --> 00:08:23.650 align:middle line:84%
And then I wrote
my book, The Hope,

00:08:23.650 --> 00:08:25.860 align:middle line:84%
and it launched a
global movement.

00:08:25.860 --> 00:08:28.315 align:middle line:84%
And people say, I hear
you about the world.

00:08:28.315 --> 00:08:29.440 align:middle line:90%
We're in a terrible crisis.

00:08:29.440 --> 00:08:30.762 align:middle line:90%
What do I do?

00:08:30.762 --> 00:08:32.095 align:middle line:90%
And I always say the same thing.

00:08:32.095 --> 00:08:34.289 align:middle line:84%
And it's really
powerful if you do it.

00:08:34.289 --> 00:08:36.950 align:middle line:84%
I say, wake up at 3
o'clock in the morning.

00:08:36.950 --> 00:08:39.140 align:middle line:84%
Surround yourself
by peace and calm.

00:08:39.140 --> 00:08:40.880 align:middle line:90%
Ask yourself one question.

00:08:40.880 --> 00:08:43.890 align:middle line:84%
What, of all of these causes,
breaks my heart the most?

00:08:43.890 --> 00:08:47.680 align:middle line:84%
And what you'll discover is that
your heartbreak will lead you

00:08:47.680 --> 00:08:50.205 align:middle line:84%
to your deepest
connection with the pain,

00:08:50.205 --> 00:08:53.370 align:middle line:84%
and cruelty, and injustice
of what's happening.

00:08:53.370 --> 00:08:56.150 align:middle line:84%
And also, by a
wonderful paradox,

00:08:56.150 --> 00:08:59.320 align:middle line:84%
to your greatest passion,
which is your passion

00:08:59.320 --> 00:09:02.250 align:middle line:84%
to do something about
what breaks your heart.

00:09:02.250 --> 00:09:05.160 align:middle line:84%
And then, by another
glorious paradox,

00:09:05.160 --> 00:09:07.612 align:middle line:84%
to your greatest
joy, because it's

00:09:07.612 --> 00:09:11.115 align:middle line:84%
when you discover your passion
that you discover your mission,

00:09:11.115 --> 00:09:14.370 align:middle line:84%
that you discover something
that you'll always,

00:09:14.370 --> 00:09:17.930 align:middle line:84%
whatever the circumstances,
however painful they may be,

00:09:17.930 --> 00:09:20.800 align:middle line:84%
give you the energy of joy
that you need to go on.

00:09:20.800 --> 00:09:22.380 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So this
is the antithesis

00:09:22.380 --> 00:09:25.654 align:middle line:84%
of the it's about
being and not doing.

00:09:25.654 --> 00:09:26.320 align:middle line:90%
>>HARVEY: Right.

00:09:26.320 --> 00:09:27.419 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:09:27.419 --> 00:09:29.710 align:middle line:84%
I mean, if you're passionate,
you want to do something.

00:09:29.710 --> 00:09:30.950 align:middle line:84%
Whatever you're
passionate about,

00:09:30.950 --> 00:09:32.110 align:middle line:90%
you want to do something.

00:09:32.110 --> 00:09:34.129 align:middle line:84%
>>HARVEY: Well, if
you're passionate--

00:09:34.129 --> 00:09:35.170 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: About anything.

00:09:35.170 --> 00:09:35.570 align:middle line:90%
>>HARVEY: About anything.

00:09:35.570 --> 00:09:35.770 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:09:35.770 --> 00:09:37.035 align:middle line:90%
>>HARVEY: About spaghetti.

00:09:37.035 --> 00:09:39.130 align:middle line:84%
You want to cook
the best spaghetti.

00:09:39.130 --> 00:09:41.980 align:middle line:84%
But at this time,
what's needed, I think,

00:09:41.980 --> 00:09:46.090 align:middle line:84%
is a great renaissance
of sacred passion.

00:09:46.090 --> 00:09:50.540 align:middle line:84%
We've got to know that
we're in a divine world.

00:09:50.540 --> 00:09:53.230 align:middle line:90%
Animals are ambassadors of God.

00:09:53.230 --> 00:09:56.840 align:middle line:84%
The trees are radiant
with divinity.

00:09:56.840 --> 00:10:00.750 align:middle line:84%
The whales are leaping
with divine power.

00:10:00.750 --> 00:10:02.900 align:middle line:84%
We are in a divine
world and we're

00:10:02.900 --> 00:10:06.780 align:middle line:84%
with other potentially
divine creatures.

00:10:06.780 --> 00:10:11.690 align:middle line:84%
And that should arouse in us
the most intense, and holy,

00:10:11.690 --> 00:10:14.930 align:middle line:84%
and beautiful, and
joyful sacred passion.

00:10:14.930 --> 00:10:20.390 align:middle line:84%
And that passion should
lead us to do anything

00:10:20.390 --> 00:10:24.280 align:middle line:84%
we can as the clock ticks
towards midnight to reverse

00:10:24.280 --> 00:10:28.900 align:middle line:84%
a situation which otherwise
will engender Armageddon.

00:10:28.900 --> 00:10:32.880 align:middle line:84%
We're facing the potential
extinction of our species

00:10:32.880 --> 00:10:35.790 align:middle line:84%
and hundreds of thousands,
if not millions, of others.

00:10:35.790 --> 00:10:37.920 align:middle line:84%
We're facing the
appalling suffering

00:10:37.920 --> 00:10:39.240 align:middle line:90%
of billions of people.

00:10:39.240 --> 00:10:42.980 align:middle line:84%
And we're doing nothing because
we've been rendered passive.

00:10:42.980 --> 00:10:43.910 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Pasionless.

00:10:43.910 --> 00:10:45.690 align:middle line:90%
>>HARVEY: And passionless.

00:10:45.690 --> 00:10:48.180 align:middle line:84%
And it's very
convenient to the powers

00:10:48.180 --> 00:10:50.650 align:middle line:84%
that be that want
this destruction, that

00:10:50.650 --> 00:10:52.493 align:middle line:84%
are organizing this
destruction, that

00:10:52.493 --> 00:10:55.520 align:middle line:84%
are drunk on this
destruction, to keep us

00:10:55.520 --> 00:10:56.970 align:middle line:90%
in a state of passionlessness.

00:10:56.970 --> 00:10:59.690 align:middle line:84%
And even, through their
corporate-sponsored

00:10:59.690 --> 00:11:04.150 align:middle line:84%
spirituality, to make
passion demented,

00:11:04.150 --> 00:11:09.110 align:middle line:84%
instead of a sign
of divine energy.

00:11:09.110 --> 00:11:11.467 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And that is where
we get into this book.

00:11:11.467 --> 00:11:12.050 align:middle line:90%
>>HARVEY: Yes.

00:11:12.050 --> 00:11:12.860 align:middle line:90%
My book is really a manifesto.

00:11:12.860 --> 00:11:14.276 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: We left
sacred activism.

00:11:14.276 --> 00:11:15.360 align:middle line:90%
And that is a manifesto.

00:11:15.360 --> 00:11:17.390 align:middle line:84%
What's so wonderful
about this, it's

00:11:17.390 --> 00:11:21.960 align:middle line:84%
a collection of prose,
poetry, from Rumi, forward.

00:11:21.960 --> 00:11:25.220 align:middle line:84%
It has articles,
beautifully-written articles

00:11:25.220 --> 00:11:27.060 align:middle line:84%
of people who have
interviewed you.

00:11:27.060 --> 00:11:28.929 align:middle line:90%
And it also has--

00:11:28.929 --> 00:11:30.220 align:middle line:90%
>>HARVEY: Interviews I've done.

00:11:30.220 --> 00:11:30.530 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: The interviews
you've done with others.

00:11:30.530 --> 00:11:31.450 align:middle line:90%
>>HARVEY: Yes, Yes.

00:11:31.450 --> 00:11:33.640 align:middle line:84%
With people who, for me,
are radical and passionate.

00:11:33.640 --> 00:11:34.430 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: It's a
collection of everything

00:11:34.430 --> 00:11:35.335 align:middle line:90%
that you hold sacred.

00:11:35.335 --> 00:11:35.680 align:middle line:90%
>>HARVEY: Yes.

00:11:35.680 --> 00:11:37.770 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And this
conversation from this point

00:11:37.770 --> 00:11:40.387 align:middle line:84%
forward will mostly be on
the first two chapters.

00:11:40.387 --> 00:11:41.220 align:middle line:90%
>>HARVEY: Thank you.

00:11:41.220 --> 00:11:44.210 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: I mean, just the first
two chapters because, I mean,

00:11:44.210 --> 00:11:45.000 align:middle line:90%
that's, what?

00:11:45.000 --> 00:11:49.118 align:middle line:84%
We still have another
80% of the book to go.

00:11:49.118 --> 00:11:50.130 align:middle line:90%
85% of the book to go.

00:11:50.130 --> 00:11:51.630 align:middle line:84%
>>HARVEY: I'll come
back every week.

00:11:51.630 --> 00:11:53.130 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And that's
because, like I

00:11:53.130 --> 00:11:55.480 align:middle line:84%
said earlier, I
dog-eared, I underlined.

00:11:55.480 --> 00:11:57.587 align:middle line:84%
Your words spoke so
profoundly and deeply to me.

00:11:57.587 --> 00:11:58.420 align:middle line:90%
>>HARVEY: Thank you.

00:11:58.420 --> 00:12:01.920 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And the way you go
into this one in the beginning

00:12:01.920 --> 00:12:04.760 align:middle line:84%
is an interview that
was done with you

00:12:04.760 --> 00:12:07.380 align:middle line:84%
about the sacred
masculine and feminine.

00:12:07.380 --> 00:12:07.880 align:middle line:90%
And again--

00:12:07.880 --> 00:12:08.490 align:middle line:90%
>>HARVEY: It's the marriage--

00:12:08.490 --> 00:12:10.031 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: --what
you're talking about

00:12:10.031 --> 00:12:12.480 align:middle line:84%
appears to be this
destruction that we're

00:12:12.480 --> 00:12:17.070 align:middle line:84%
facing appears to
be the manifestation

00:12:17.070 --> 00:12:19.480 align:middle line:84%
of a runaway patriarchy for
the last few thousand years.

00:12:19.480 --> 00:12:20.050 align:middle line:90%
>>HARVEY: Yes, yes.

00:12:20.050 --> 00:12:21.040 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: It can't go that way.

00:12:21.040 --> 00:12:22.610 align:middle line:84%
We know we've all
heard that it has to--

00:12:22.610 --> 00:12:23.040 align:middle line:84%
>>HARVEY: The demented
masculine, yes.

00:12:23.040 --> 00:12:25.070 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: It's the time
of demented masculine.

00:12:25.070 --> 00:12:25.653 align:middle line:90%
>>HARVEY: Yes.

00:12:25.653 --> 00:12:27.492 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And I wanted
to get into some

00:12:27.492 --> 00:12:28.450 align:middle line:90%
of your understandings.

00:12:28.450 --> 00:12:30.783 align:middle line:84%
And if you don't mind, if
you'd go back many years, back

00:12:30.783 --> 00:12:32.470 align:middle line:84%
to your childhood
in India, and talk

00:12:32.470 --> 00:12:37.590 align:middle line:84%
a little bit about how the
mysticism of the Indian way

00:12:37.590 --> 00:12:39.210 align:middle line:84%
and Hindu way of
life and the Vedas

00:12:39.210 --> 00:12:42.800 align:middle line:84%
started melting with
Christian mysticism.

00:12:42.800 --> 00:12:45.545 align:middle line:84%
>>HARVEY: That's a
wonderful question.

00:12:45.545 --> 00:12:49.010 align:middle line:84%
Well, I was born in India in
the twilight of the British Raj.

00:12:49.010 --> 00:12:53.820 align:middle line:84%
The Raj had ended in
'47 and I was born '52.

00:12:53.820 --> 00:12:59.070 align:middle line:84%
But I was born in a very,
very beautiful part of India,

00:12:59.070 --> 00:13:01.210 align:middle line:90%
in South India.

00:13:01.210 --> 00:13:04.770 align:middle line:84%
And growing up in India was
a very sacred experience

00:13:04.770 --> 00:13:08.900 align:middle line:84%
because my parents were very
tolerant, very open-minded.

00:13:08.900 --> 00:13:14.330 align:middle line:84%
And I had a Muslim
driver and a Hindu cook.

00:13:14.330 --> 00:13:17.320 align:middle line:84%
And I was often invited
to go to temples.

00:13:17.320 --> 00:13:19.990 align:middle line:84%
And we were surrounded,
when we lived in Delhi,

00:13:19.990 --> 00:13:22.790 align:middle line:84%
with the monuments
of the old Mughal

00:13:22.790 --> 00:13:25.360 align:middle line:90%
emperors, the great Sufi tombs.

00:13:25.360 --> 00:13:28.750 align:middle line:84%
So very, very early on,
I think I understood

00:13:28.750 --> 00:13:32.250 align:middle line:84%
that there could
only be one divine.

00:13:32.250 --> 00:13:34.870 align:middle line:84%
And that all the revelations
were like colored glass,

00:13:34.870 --> 00:13:38.390 align:middle line:84%
that this one light was coming
through from different angles.

00:13:38.390 --> 00:13:41.290 align:middle line:84%
And that grounded my whole
life in an understanding

00:13:41.290 --> 00:13:46.250 align:middle line:84%
that the whole universe is the
expression of this divinity,

00:13:46.250 --> 00:13:47.785 align:middle line:90%
this oneness, this radiance.

00:13:47.785 --> 00:13:50.560 align:middle line:90%


00:13:50.560 --> 00:13:56.500 align:middle line:84%
But I was born into a Protestant
family, a Christian family.

00:13:56.500 --> 00:13:59.470 align:middle line:84%
And I think the
deepest reason for that

00:13:59.470 --> 00:14:06.275 align:middle line:84%
is that I was meant to have,
from the early part of my life,

00:14:06.275 --> 00:14:08.455 align:middle line:84%
from the earliest
part of my life,

00:14:08.455 --> 00:14:12.790 align:middle line:84%
an absolutely passionate
connection with Jesus.

00:14:12.790 --> 00:14:18.030 align:middle line:84%
Not just the son of God, not
as the founder of a church,

00:14:18.030 --> 00:14:24.560 align:middle line:84%
but as someone whose total
radical passion was in service

00:14:24.560 --> 00:14:29.000 align:middle line:84%
of a transformation of
the whole of humanity,

00:14:29.000 --> 00:14:33.800 align:middle line:84%
and of every institution, and
every way of doing everything.

00:14:33.800 --> 00:14:36.980 align:middle line:84%
Jesus is the supreme
revolutionary of human history,

00:14:36.980 --> 00:14:39.907 align:middle line:84%
the revolutionary of divine
love, the rebel of justice.

00:14:39.907 --> 00:14:41.740 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And yet, is
rendered as a passive.

00:14:41.740 --> 00:14:43.200 align:middle line:90%
>>HARVEY: Oh god, that is--

00:14:43.200 --> 00:14:43.780 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: A pacifist as well.

00:14:43.780 --> 00:14:45.080 align:middle line:84%
>>HARVEY: --one of the great
triumphs of the patriarchy--

00:14:45.080 --> 00:14:46.038 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: That's right.

00:14:46.038 --> 00:14:49.580 align:middle line:84%
>>HARVEY: --to turn the
supreme rebel into a support.

00:14:49.580 --> 00:14:51.010 align:middle line:90%
That was very clever of them.

00:14:51.010 --> 00:14:54.340 align:middle line:84%
But I think the reason
I was born in India

00:14:54.340 --> 00:14:56.480 align:middle line:84%
was because my
whole life was going

00:14:56.480 --> 00:14:59.080 align:middle line:84%
to be a bridge
between the greatest

00:14:59.080 --> 00:15:02.660 align:middle line:84%
truths of Western civilization
and Western religion

00:15:02.660 --> 00:15:04.840 align:middle line:84%
and Eastern civilization
and Eastern region.

00:15:04.840 --> 00:15:08.451 align:middle line:84%
And my whole life has been
really about marrying the two

00:15:08.451 --> 00:15:09.700 align:middle line:90%
and bringing the two together.

00:15:09.700 --> 00:15:13.270 align:middle line:84%
Because I think we're at the age
when a universal mysticism is

00:15:13.270 --> 00:15:16.870 align:middle line:84%
being born in which the
wisest, and deepest,

00:15:16.870 --> 00:15:19.765 align:middle line:84%
and most profound insights
of all of the traditions

00:15:19.765 --> 00:15:24.070 align:middle line:84%
are coming together,
but being focused

00:15:24.070 --> 00:15:26.980 align:middle line:84%
by the Christ
passion for justice

00:15:26.980 --> 00:15:28.890 align:middle line:84%
and for transformation
of the world.

00:15:28.890 --> 00:15:31.680 align:middle line:84%
You see, the problem with
the Western traditions

00:15:31.680 --> 00:15:34.810 align:middle line:84%
is that they don't have a deep
enough sense of divine truth

00:15:34.810 --> 00:15:37.930 align:middle line:84%
and identity, which is the
great, amazing contribution

00:15:37.930 --> 00:15:39.270 align:middle line:90%
of the East.

00:15:39.270 --> 00:15:41.340 align:middle line:84%
The problem of the
Eastern traditions

00:15:41.340 --> 00:15:45.630 align:middle line:84%
is that they got lost in their
passion for transcendence,

00:15:45.630 --> 00:15:47.340 align:middle line:84%
and dropped the world,
dropped society,

00:15:47.340 --> 00:15:50.830 align:middle line:84%
dropped the whole question
of sexual and emotional

00:15:50.830 --> 00:15:54.190 align:middle line:84%
relationship, and became
essentially addicts

00:15:54.190 --> 00:15:55.690 align:middle line:90%
of transcendence.

00:15:55.690 --> 00:15:58.790 align:middle line:84%
But if you bring the best
of the Western passion

00:15:58.790 --> 00:16:01.880 align:middle line:84%
for evolution, and for
history, and for transformation

00:16:01.880 --> 00:16:05.820 align:middle line:84%
of society, together with the
Eastern knowledge of divinity

00:16:05.820 --> 00:16:08.590 align:middle line:84%
and the identity of
humanity with divinity,

00:16:08.590 --> 00:16:10.550 align:middle line:84%
then you have the
potential cocktail

00:16:10.550 --> 00:16:11.800 align:middle line:90%
that can transform everything.

00:16:11.800 --> 00:16:16.099 align:middle line:84%
And my life has been about
imagining that, pursuing that,

00:16:16.099 --> 00:16:17.640 align:middle line:84%
trying to understand
that, and trying

00:16:17.640 --> 00:16:20.522 align:middle line:84%
to express it to
everybody I could.

00:16:20.522 --> 00:16:21.980 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And so
now that brings us

00:16:21.980 --> 00:16:25.607 align:middle line:84%
to the notion of the
two faces of God.

00:16:25.607 --> 00:16:26.190 align:middle line:90%
>>HARVEY: Yes.

00:16:26.190 --> 00:16:29.590 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And the vast
meaning of these two faces.

00:16:29.590 --> 00:16:32.400 align:middle line:84%
And you use the word
transcendence and eminence.

00:16:32.400 --> 00:16:33.020 align:middle line:90%
>>HARVEY: Yes.

00:16:33.020 --> 00:16:34.920 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And explain
what this means

00:16:34.920 --> 00:16:35.630 align:middle line:90%
and why they are together.

00:16:35.630 --> 00:16:36.030 align:middle line:84%
>>HARVEY: Well, it's
very simple, yes.

00:16:36.030 --> 00:16:37.240 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And also,
I would like you

00:16:37.240 --> 00:16:38.350 align:middle line:84%
to read a passage from
your own book here.

00:16:38.350 --> 00:16:39.309 align:middle line:90%
>>HARVEY: Oh, anything.

00:16:39.309 --> 00:16:40.600 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: This part right here.

00:16:40.600 --> 00:16:42.390 align:middle line:84%
If you could explain
this to us, and even

00:16:42.390 --> 00:16:43.640 align:middle line:84%
read the parts that
I've underlying.

00:16:43.640 --> 00:16:44.010 align:middle line:90%
>>HARVEY: Thank you.

00:16:44.010 --> 00:16:44.765 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: If you don't mind.

00:16:44.765 --> 00:16:45.910 align:middle line:90%
They're in your own words.

00:16:45.910 --> 00:16:47.600 align:middle line:90%
>>HARVEY: OK.

00:16:47.600 --> 00:16:50.494 align:middle line:84%
"Andrew speaks of the roles
of the masculine and feminine,

00:16:50.494 --> 00:16:52.410 align:middle line:84%
insisting that it is the
role of the masculine

00:16:52.410 --> 00:16:54.959 align:middle line:84%
to protect and
illuminate the feminine.

00:16:54.959 --> 00:16:56.750 align:middle line:84%
And when he refers to
masculine properties,

00:16:56.750 --> 00:16:58.700 align:middle line:84%
he means the transcendent,
detached care

00:16:58.700 --> 00:17:00.252 align:middle line:84%
and active aspects
of the godhead.

00:17:00.252 --> 00:17:01.960 align:middle line:84%
And when he speaks of
feminine qualities,

00:17:01.960 --> 00:17:05.319 align:middle line:84%
he means eminent, creative,
life-sustaining, perceptive,

00:17:05.319 --> 00:17:08.222 align:middle line:84%
embodied aspects
of the godhead."

00:17:08.222 --> 00:17:09.930 align:middle line:84%
Well, that's a pretty
grand way of saying

00:17:09.930 --> 00:17:15.170 align:middle line:84%
that in the Hindu
tradition, the relationship

00:17:15.170 --> 00:17:17.079 align:middle line:84%
between transcendence
and eminence,

00:17:17.079 --> 00:17:20.359 align:middle line:84%
the mother and the
father, light and matter,

00:17:20.359 --> 00:17:22.060 align:middle line:84%
is expressed in
the following way--

00:17:22.060 --> 00:17:25.369 align:middle line:90%
as the diamond and its shining.

00:17:25.369 --> 00:17:28.910 align:middle line:84%
The transcendent
bliss, peace, silence,

00:17:28.910 --> 00:17:33.650 align:middle line:84%
which is beyond all
form, is the diamond.

00:17:33.650 --> 00:17:38.620 align:middle line:84%
And the shining of the
diamond is the bliss energy

00:17:38.620 --> 00:17:40.420 align:middle line:84%
that creates the
universe and then lives

00:17:40.420 --> 00:17:42.540 align:middle line:84%
in and as every aspect
of the universe,

00:17:42.540 --> 00:17:44.136 align:middle line:90%
and that's the mother.

00:17:44.136 --> 00:17:46.400 align:middle line:84%
The diamond is the
father; the mother

00:17:46.400 --> 00:17:48.410 align:middle line:90%
is the shining of the diamond.

00:17:48.410 --> 00:17:53.630 align:middle line:84%
And although they're not the
same, they're not two either.

00:17:53.630 --> 00:17:56.120 align:middle line:90%
They're totally interrelated.

00:17:56.120 --> 00:17:58.970 align:middle line:84%
So when you come through
mystical understanding

00:17:58.970 --> 00:18:03.030 align:middle line:84%
to experience this at
a very deep level, what

00:18:03.030 --> 00:18:09.360 align:middle line:84%
you come to know is that
everything that is embodied

00:18:09.360 --> 00:18:12.950 align:middle line:90%
is crystallized light energy.

00:18:12.950 --> 00:18:17.594 align:middle line:84%
The light, the eternal diamond
white light, consciousness.

00:18:17.594 --> 00:18:19.010 align:middle line:84%
It's the foundation
of everything.

00:18:19.010 --> 00:18:20.697 align:middle line:90%
Everything is made out of it.

00:18:20.697 --> 00:18:22.280 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: We're
trying to find our way

00:18:22.280 --> 00:18:24.840 align:middle line:84%
in our crazy, imbalanced
ways of doing things,

00:18:24.840 --> 00:18:27.180 align:middle line:84%
we're trying to find that
balance between the two.

00:18:27.180 --> 00:18:27.510 align:middle line:90%
>>HARVEY: We must.

00:18:27.510 --> 00:18:28.735 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: We're trying
to find that wholeness.

00:18:28.735 --> 00:18:29.425 align:middle line:90%
>>HARVEY: We have no hope.

00:18:29.425 --> 00:18:30.585 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: I mean, can I give
you an example of someone?

00:18:30.585 --> 00:18:32.040 align:middle line:90%
This will make you laugh.

00:18:32.040 --> 00:18:32.560 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:18:32.560 --> 00:18:34.680 align:middle line:84%
It's a fellow, an
acquaintance of ours,

00:18:34.680 --> 00:18:36.600 align:middle line:90%
who lives in Southeast Asia.

00:18:36.600 --> 00:18:41.900 align:middle line:84%
He spends probably 2/3 of
his time in a monastery.

00:18:41.900 --> 00:18:42.680 align:middle line:90%
>>HARVEY: Gosh.

00:18:42.680 --> 00:18:44.909 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: The other third
of the time is in brothels.

00:18:44.909 --> 00:18:45.950 align:middle line:90%
>>HARVEY: Oh my goodness.

00:18:45.950 --> 00:18:48.822 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: He zings back
and forth between the two.

00:18:48.822 --> 00:18:52.314 align:middle line:84%
>>HARVEY: He has truly chosen
the path of the opposites, yes.

00:18:52.314 --> 00:18:53.970 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: But the
interesting thing

00:18:53.970 --> 00:18:57.940 align:middle line:84%
is when he's done with one, he's
so full of it and in one way,

00:18:57.940 --> 00:19:00.190 align:middle line:84%
saturated and almost
repentant of one,

00:19:00.190 --> 00:19:01.720 align:middle line:90%
that he zings back to the other.

00:19:01.720 --> 00:19:05.110 align:middle line:84%
But what is this man's
life demonstrating in terms

00:19:05.110 --> 00:19:05.820 align:middle line:90%
of a deeper need?

00:19:05.820 --> 00:19:07.986 align:middle line:84%
I mean, I'm sure there are
people watching this that

00:19:07.986 --> 00:19:10.620 align:middle line:84%
can relate to this and would do
the same given the opportunity.

00:19:10.620 --> 00:19:12.130 align:middle line:90%
>>HARVEY: Yes.

00:19:12.130 --> 00:19:14.530 align:middle line:84%
I think what he's really
looking for is perhaps

00:19:14.530 --> 00:19:16.925 align:middle line:90%
the balance between the two.

00:19:16.925 --> 00:19:22.270 align:middle line:84%
That he's trying to find a real
relationship between immersion

00:19:22.270 --> 00:19:25.992 align:middle line:84%
in the peace and silence of the
light and profound enjoyment

00:19:25.992 --> 00:19:26.575 align:middle line:90%
of embodiment.

00:19:26.575 --> 00:19:27.630 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:19:27.630 --> 00:19:31.610 align:middle line:84%
>>HARVEY: And I think there are
less extreme ways of finding

00:19:31.610 --> 00:19:33.927 align:middle line:84%
that, and it's
simply by-- I think

00:19:33.927 --> 00:19:35.510 align:middle line:84%
in my case, what I
came to understand,

00:19:35.510 --> 00:19:39.500 align:middle line:84%
perhaps because of India was
that when you come to know God

00:19:39.500 --> 00:19:45.110 align:middle line:84%
as mother, then God
the mother takes you

00:19:45.110 --> 00:19:48.189 align:middle line:84%
into the experience of your
transcendent light origin,

00:19:48.189 --> 00:19:50.480 align:middle line:84%
gives you that experience so
that you know that you are

00:19:50.480 --> 00:19:55.320 align:middle line:84%
timeless, and spaceless, and not
the body, and absolutely free

00:19:55.320 --> 00:19:55.940 align:middle line:90%
and deathless.

00:19:55.940 --> 00:19:58.400 align:middle line:90%
And it's a supreme experience.

00:19:58.400 --> 00:20:02.630 align:middle line:84%
But then she says, don't
just hang out here.

00:20:02.630 --> 00:20:03.450 align:middle line:90%
Come back.

00:20:03.450 --> 00:20:07.340 align:middle line:84%
I'll show you that I'm actually
living in every stone and every

00:20:07.340 --> 00:20:10.740 align:middle line:84%
flea, in every aspect
of your life. .

00:20:10.740 --> 00:20:13.000 align:middle line:84%
And what you're
really being offered

00:20:13.000 --> 00:20:15.230 align:middle line:90%
is a part of my own experience.

00:20:15.230 --> 00:20:18.090 align:middle line:84%
I'm both the light and
everything that's embodied.

00:20:18.090 --> 00:20:20.530 align:middle line:84%
And you can be too
because you're my child.

00:20:20.530 --> 00:20:23.540 align:middle line:84%
So you can enter with this
wisdom, and this passion,

00:20:23.540 --> 00:20:25.380 align:middle line:84%
and this silence,
and this rapture.

00:20:25.380 --> 00:20:29.030 align:middle line:84%
That you can experience
your life as my gift

00:20:29.030 --> 00:20:30.725 align:middle line:90%
to you of bliss.

00:20:30.725 --> 00:20:32.600 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And one of
the things you mentioned

00:20:32.600 --> 00:20:35.830 align:middle line:84%
is in opposition to that is
you bring the question up,

00:20:35.830 --> 00:20:39.030 align:middle line:84%
do people-- and many
people, many, many people,

00:20:39.030 --> 00:20:41.061 align:middle line:84%
in both the East and
the West I would think

00:20:41.061 --> 00:20:42.310 align:middle line:90%
would have to say yes to this.

00:20:42.310 --> 00:20:44.895 align:middle line:84%
Do you really believe that this
body is some kind of prison--

00:20:44.895 --> 00:20:45.770 align:middle line:90%
>>HARVEY: Oh god, no.

00:20:45.770 --> 00:20:48.469 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: --that's only meant
to attempt to escape from?

00:20:48.469 --> 00:20:50.260 align:middle line:84%
>>HARVEY: Oh, I think
that's a mad-- that's

00:20:50.260 --> 00:20:52.160 align:middle line:84%
been the horror of the
patriarchal approach

00:20:52.160 --> 00:20:56.350 align:middle line:84%
because if you look at
the history of religion,

00:20:56.350 --> 00:20:59.320 align:middle line:84%
of our vision of God, it
seems that at the beginning,

00:20:59.320 --> 00:21:02.620 align:middle line:84%
we began with a largely
matriarchal vision.

00:21:02.620 --> 00:21:04.310 align:middle line:84%
At least, one that
had at its core

00:21:04.310 --> 00:21:07.790 align:middle line:84%
an astoundingly profound
understanding of the universe

00:21:07.790 --> 00:21:10.220 align:middle line:90%
as this great, fecund mother.

00:21:10.220 --> 00:21:13.300 align:middle line:84%
And of us being
deeply, deeply related

00:21:13.300 --> 00:21:15.195 align:middle line:84%
to every living
creature, every stone,

00:21:15.195 --> 00:21:16.460 align:middle line:90%
every piece of everything.

00:21:16.460 --> 00:21:18.610 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: In what would commonly
be called more pagan times?

00:21:18.610 --> 00:21:18.820 align:middle line:90%
>>HARVEY: Yes.

00:21:18.820 --> 00:21:19.470 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:21:19.470 --> 00:21:23.790 align:middle line:84%
>>HARVEY: And then there was the
Aryan invasion and the vision

00:21:23.790 --> 00:21:25.860 align:middle line:84%
of God as utterly and
purely transcendence,

00:21:25.860 --> 00:21:29.230 align:middle line:84%
so there was a separation
between nature and the divine,

00:21:29.230 --> 00:21:31.010 align:middle line:84%
between human beings
and the divine.

00:21:31.010 --> 00:21:34.080 align:middle line:84%
And this gave us tremendous
wisdom at certain level,

00:21:34.080 --> 00:21:37.140 align:middle line:84%
but it also created
a schizophrenia

00:21:37.140 --> 00:21:38.747 align:middle line:84%
which is now
ravaging everything.

00:21:38.747 --> 00:21:39.330 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:21:39.330 --> 00:21:42.770 align:middle line:84%
>>HARVEY: So I think
that what we now need

00:21:42.770 --> 00:21:45.640 align:middle line:84%
is an era of bringing
together the deepest

00:21:45.640 --> 00:21:47.670 align:middle line:84%
understanding of the
matriarchal religions

00:21:47.670 --> 00:21:49.540 align:middle line:84%
with the wisdom and
technology that we've

00:21:49.540 --> 00:21:51.450 align:middle line:90%
evolved in the patriarchy.

00:21:51.450 --> 00:21:55.510 align:middle line:84%
But dedicated not to power,
but to living in harmony

00:21:55.510 --> 00:21:58.240 align:middle line:90%
with the creation, with love.

00:21:58.240 --> 00:22:02.150 align:middle line:84%
If we can do that, we can
bring together all the deepest

00:22:02.150 --> 00:22:04.590 align:middle line:84%
and richest sources
of our inspiration,

00:22:04.590 --> 00:22:07.400 align:middle line:84%
and with God's grace,
create a wholly new way

00:22:07.400 --> 00:22:09.070 align:middle line:90%
of being and doing everything.

00:22:09.070 --> 00:22:12.110 align:middle line:84%
But we've got to go fast now
because we've created out

00:22:12.110 --> 00:22:15.500 align:middle line:84%
of our hubris, and our madness,
and our addiction to dominating

00:22:15.500 --> 00:22:18.365 align:middle line:84%
nature, a crisis which
is exploding in our faces

00:22:18.365 --> 00:22:21.190 align:middle line:84%
and which could
potentially destroy us.

00:22:21.190 --> 00:22:26.310 align:middle line:84%
What is now needed is for us
to bring together the highest

00:22:26.310 --> 00:22:28.790 align:middle line:84%
silence and peace of
the transcendent father

00:22:28.790 --> 00:22:33.040 align:middle line:84%
divine with the passion
for compassion and justice

00:22:33.040 --> 00:22:36.220 align:middle line:84%
of the mother divine so
that we can bring together

00:22:36.220 --> 00:22:40.220 align:middle line:84%
the whole synthesis of
human and divine truths

00:22:40.220 --> 00:22:41.800 align:middle line:90%
and birth a new humanity.

00:22:41.800 --> 00:22:43.340 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Absolutely.

00:22:43.340 --> 00:22:45.376 align:middle line:90%
>>HARVEY: It's a modest plan.

00:22:45.376 --> 00:22:46.310 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:22:46.310 --> 00:22:46.810 align:middle line:90%
Doable.

00:22:46.810 --> 00:22:47.990 align:middle line:84%
>>HARVEY: Yeah, I believe
it's the plan of the divine.

00:22:47.990 --> 00:22:49.670 align:middle line:90%
I believe that this is what--

00:22:49.670 --> 00:22:50.390 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: I think
you're absolutely right.

00:22:50.390 --> 00:22:52.806 align:middle line:84%
>>HARVEY: --many, many beings
have woken up to, especially

00:22:52.806 --> 00:22:54.250 align:middle line:90%
in the last 150 years.

00:22:54.250 --> 00:22:56.125 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Well now, this
is a little example,

00:22:56.125 --> 00:22:58.490 align:middle line:84%
and I know it's wholly
third-dimensional,

00:22:58.490 --> 00:23:01.490 align:middle line:84%
but it's something that when
I was reading that passage you

00:23:01.490 --> 00:23:03.650 align:middle line:84%
read aloud, it's
something regarding

00:23:03.650 --> 00:23:05.890 align:middle line:84%
the masculine and
feminine that I related to

00:23:05.890 --> 00:23:07.870 align:middle line:84%
and related back
to very strongly,

00:23:07.870 --> 00:23:09.600 align:middle line:84%
in the dance, the
Argentine tango.

00:23:09.600 --> 00:23:10.500 align:middle line:90%
>>HARVEY: Yes.

00:23:10.500 --> 00:23:11.490 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Which is--

00:23:11.490 --> 00:23:12.780 align:middle line:84%
>>HARVEY: One of
my favorite things.

00:23:12.780 --> 00:23:13.020 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: For me, too.

00:23:13.020 --> 00:23:14.395 align:middle line:84%
>>HARVEY: Flamenco's
my favorite.

00:23:14.395 --> 00:23:16.199 align:middle line:84%
Argentine tango's my
second favorite, yes.

00:23:16.199 --> 00:23:17.990 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: I would
reverse those in my life.

00:23:17.990 --> 00:23:18.300 align:middle line:90%
>>HARVEY: I figured

00:23:18.300 --> 00:23:19.325 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: I dance tango.

00:23:19.325 --> 00:23:20.820 align:middle line:90%
Of course, I'm prejudiced.

00:23:20.820 --> 00:23:22.810 align:middle line:84%
But one of things about
the Argentine tango,

00:23:22.810 --> 00:23:25.980 align:middle line:84%
and I've written about this
before, wrote essays about it,

00:23:25.980 --> 00:23:31.520 align:middle line:84%
is when it's done well, what you
have is a man who has perfected

00:23:31.520 --> 00:23:34.350 align:middle line:84%
his own abilities to
the point where he has

00:23:34.350 --> 00:23:36.650 align:middle line:84%
this confidence
that he's exuding,

00:23:36.650 --> 00:23:39.660 align:middle line:84%
this perfection that he's
exuding and expressing

00:23:39.660 --> 00:23:40.950 align:middle line:90%
through his dance.

00:23:40.950 --> 00:23:42.455 align:middle line:90%
Now, that takes time.

00:23:42.455 --> 00:23:44.050 align:middle line:90%
It's not an easy dance.

00:23:44.050 --> 00:23:47.070 align:middle line:84%
The man takes time to
learn this, and practice,

00:23:47.070 --> 00:23:48.570 align:middle line:90%
and shine this.

00:23:48.570 --> 00:23:51.560 align:middle line:84%
And so what happens then
with the woman, when you're

00:23:51.560 --> 00:23:54.520 align:middle line:84%
watching people dance at
the highest level of tango,

00:23:54.520 --> 00:23:56.950 align:middle line:84%
you see a woman who has
a beautiful dress on.

00:23:56.950 --> 00:24:00.050 align:middle line:84%
Her legs are in and out and
around and all over the place,

00:24:00.050 --> 00:24:01.630 align:middle line:90%
and all eyes are on the woman.

00:24:01.630 --> 00:24:03.410 align:middle line:84%
Well, the only reason
that can happen

00:24:03.410 --> 00:24:06.010 align:middle line:84%
is because of the
incredible mastery

00:24:06.010 --> 00:24:08.850 align:middle line:90%
of that man who can, A, lead.

00:24:08.850 --> 00:24:11.927 align:middle line:84%
He has the full responsibility
of leading that dance.

00:24:11.927 --> 00:24:12.760 align:middle line:90%
>>HARVEY: That's it.

00:24:12.760 --> 00:24:16.750 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: But who has the
wisdom and understanding

00:24:16.750 --> 00:24:19.950 align:middle line:84%
to back off and leave these
beautiful spaces in the dance,

00:24:19.950 --> 00:24:22.702 align:middle line:84%
which is where the
woman flourishes.

00:24:22.702 --> 00:24:24.660 align:middle line:84%
That's where all these
beautiful things happen.

00:24:24.660 --> 00:24:26.368 align:middle line:84%
>>HARVEY: This is such
a beautiful-- yes.

00:24:26.368 --> 00:24:28.670 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So his job is
to protect and illuminate,

00:24:28.670 --> 00:24:29.510 align:middle line:90%
as you say.

00:24:29.510 --> 00:24:33.210 align:middle line:84%
And hers is to shine out through
this material expression.

00:24:33.210 --> 00:24:35.335 align:middle line:84%
I mean, to me it's just
the most sublime experience

00:24:35.335 --> 00:24:36.334 align:middle line:90%
when you're having that.

00:24:36.334 --> 00:24:38.460 align:middle line:84%
>>HARVEY: Well, what he
needs is a passion for her.

00:24:38.460 --> 00:24:39.043 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:24:39.043 --> 00:24:41.480 align:middle line:84%
>>HARVEY: He is totally
passionate about her

00:24:41.480 --> 00:24:44.010 align:middle line:84%
and about giving her
the space in which

00:24:44.010 --> 00:24:48.446 align:middle line:84%
to enfold the amazing
beauty that she is.

00:24:48.446 --> 00:24:49.154 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: It is.

00:24:49.154 --> 00:24:51.070 align:middle line:84%
>>HARVEY: And that's
what the divine is doing.

00:24:51.070 --> 00:24:51.560 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:24:51.560 --> 00:24:53.356 align:middle line:84%
>>HARVEY: It's the her that
is creating and dancing

00:24:53.356 --> 00:24:54.200 align:middle line:90%
in the universe.

00:24:54.200 --> 00:24:56.997 align:middle line:84%
And he's witnessing this because
it's being spun out of both.

00:24:56.997 --> 00:24:58.580 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: But he's
holding the clarity

00:24:58.580 --> 00:24:59.622 align:middle line:90%
and the framework for it.

00:24:59.622 --> 00:25:00.205 align:middle line:90%
>>HARVEY: Yes.

00:25:00.205 --> 00:25:00.717 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

00:25:00.717 --> 00:25:01.800 align:middle line:90%
And these are only images.

00:25:01.800 --> 00:25:02.927 align:middle line:90%
We're talking he and she.

00:25:02.927 --> 00:25:03.510 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:25:03.510 --> 00:25:03.950 align:middle line:90%
>>HARVEY: Right.

00:25:03.950 --> 00:25:05.240 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: I mean, I'm just
talking in the trenches,

00:25:05.240 --> 00:25:06.570 align:middle line:84%
something simple
anybody can visualize.

00:25:06.570 --> 00:25:06.690 align:middle line:90%
>>HARVEY: Yes.

00:25:06.690 --> 00:25:06.750 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

00:25:06.750 --> 00:25:07.654 align:middle line:90%
No, it's fantastic.

00:25:07.654 --> 00:25:09.070 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: But the
other thing, you

00:25:09.070 --> 00:25:11.156 align:middle line:84%
dance with the man who now
has mastered the dance,

00:25:11.156 --> 00:25:13.360 align:middle line:84%
but he's still living
in the patriarchy.

00:25:13.360 --> 00:25:15.677 align:middle line:84%
He drives you like a Mack
truck around the floor.

00:25:15.677 --> 00:25:16.260 align:middle line:90%
>>HARVEY: Yes.

00:25:16.260 --> 00:25:17.880 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: It has to be his will.

00:25:17.880 --> 00:25:19.950 align:middle line:84%
And then the woman
has no expression.

00:25:19.950 --> 00:25:21.957 align:middle line:84%
And you walk off the
floor feeling beaten up

00:25:21.957 --> 00:25:24.540 align:middle line:84%
and you don't want to dance with
this person again, basically.

00:25:24.540 --> 00:25:26.365 align:middle line:84%
No matter how masterful
they've become,

00:25:26.365 --> 00:25:29.217 align:middle line:84%
they haven't been
ultimately masterful

00:25:29.217 --> 00:25:30.550 align:middle line:90%
in the larger sense of the word.

00:25:30.550 --> 00:25:31.610 align:middle line:90%
>>HARVEY: Of course not.

00:25:31.610 --> 00:25:33.360 align:middle line:84%
Don't you think the
other, marvelous thing

00:25:33.360 --> 00:25:35.127 align:middle line:90%
about both flamenco and--

00:25:35.127 --> 00:25:36.210 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Argentine tango.

00:25:36.210 --> 00:25:39.650 align:middle line:84%
>>HARVEY: --Argentine
tango is that the woman

00:25:39.650 --> 00:25:42.787 align:middle line:84%
is allowed to be
completely herself?

00:25:42.787 --> 00:25:43.370 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:25:43.370 --> 00:25:45.590 align:middle line:84%
>>HARVEY: In fact,
what's so staggering,

00:25:45.590 --> 00:25:49.610 align:middle line:84%
I think, is how electric and
sometimes violent, and wild,

00:25:49.610 --> 00:25:54.794 align:middle line:84%
and unbelievably extremely
passionate the feminine is

00:25:54.794 --> 00:25:56.960 align:middle line:84%
allowed to be because the
masculine isn't frightened

00:25:56.960 --> 00:25:58.910 align:middle line:84%
of it, isn't trying
to control it,

00:25:58.910 --> 00:26:01.540 align:middle line:84%
isn't trying to mutilate
it, isn't trying to tame it,

00:26:01.540 --> 00:26:03.250 align:middle line:90%
isn't trying to tamp it down.

00:26:03.250 --> 00:26:05.820 align:middle line:84%
Because the masculine is
so strong within itself

00:26:05.820 --> 00:26:10.374 align:middle line:84%
that it just can afford
to adore the full splendor

00:26:10.374 --> 00:26:11.040 align:middle line:90%
of the feminine.

00:26:11.040 --> 00:26:11.320 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Exactly.

00:26:11.320 --> 00:26:13.040 align:middle line:84%
It can afford to
because it's full.

00:26:13.040 --> 00:26:14.350 align:middle line:84%
>>HARVEY: And this is what is
happening within the divine.

00:26:14.350 --> 00:26:14.920 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:26:14.920 --> 00:26:16.461 align:middle line:84%
>>HARVEY: And I
think when we take it

00:26:16.461 --> 00:26:19.080 align:middle line:84%
out of the male/female,
what we realize

00:26:19.080 --> 00:26:21.810 align:middle line:84%
is that we all have masculine
and feminine qualities.

00:26:21.810 --> 00:26:23.570 align:middle line:84%
And that perhaps
the meaning of-- one

00:26:23.570 --> 00:26:27.510 align:middle line:84%
of the most profound meanings
of life is to live in such a way

00:26:27.510 --> 00:26:30.190 align:middle line:84%
that your sacred masculine
and your sacred feminine

00:26:30.190 --> 00:26:34.440 align:middle line:84%
come into deep unity
within yourself

00:26:34.440 --> 00:26:38.440 align:middle line:84%
so that your clarity, and
intelligence, and lucidity,

00:26:38.440 --> 00:26:42.930 align:middle line:84%
and confidence, and power,
and strength can support.

00:26:42.930 --> 00:26:46.230 align:middle line:84%
And your passion for
creativity, your passion

00:26:46.230 --> 00:26:49.600 align:middle line:84%
to love, your passion
to transform society,

00:26:49.600 --> 00:26:52.870 align:middle line:84%
your passion to
create, all of which

00:26:52.870 --> 00:26:54.940 align:middle line:84%
are such sublime
gifts of the feminine.

00:26:54.940 --> 00:26:58.760 align:middle line:84%
And instead of them being
in tension or in conflict,

00:26:58.760 --> 00:27:01.063 align:middle line:84%
they're actually feeding
from each other's beauty

00:27:01.063 --> 00:27:01.190 align:middle line:90%
and strength.

00:27:01.190 --> 00:27:02.285 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: They should
be feeding from each.

00:27:02.285 --> 00:27:04.609 align:middle line:84%
But that's not what's
happening in the trenches.

00:27:04.609 --> 00:27:06.275 align:middle line:84%
It's not what's
happening on the ground.

00:27:06.275 --> 00:27:07.441 align:middle line:90%
>>HARVEY: Of course not, no.

00:27:07.441 --> 00:27:10.005 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: We have women who
have-- well, we understand--

00:27:10.005 --> 00:27:12.130 align:middle line:84%
we'll talk about this a
little later, because we're

00:27:12.130 --> 00:27:13.035 align:middle line:84%
going to take a
break in a minute

00:27:13.035 --> 00:27:13.840 align:middle line:90%
and I want to get into it.

00:27:13.840 --> 00:27:14.050 align:middle line:90%
>>HARVEY: Yes.

00:27:14.050 --> 00:27:15.640 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: But we
have women who have

00:27:15.640 --> 00:27:19.010 align:middle line:84%
been made to feel less than
because of their femininity.

00:27:19.010 --> 00:27:20.330 align:middle line:90%
>>HARVEY: Yes, and men.

00:27:20.330 --> 00:27:21.267 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: But now men.

00:27:21.267 --> 00:27:21.850 align:middle line:90%
>>HARVEY: Yes.

00:27:21.850 --> 00:27:24.040 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: In the last
30 years, the men

00:27:24.040 --> 00:27:25.980 align:middle line:84%
have been made to
feel less than.

00:27:25.980 --> 00:27:29.460 align:middle line:84%
And at leaves two staring at
each other, almost confused

00:27:29.460 --> 00:27:31.600 align:middle line:84%
as to what the roles
are any longer.

00:27:31.600 --> 00:27:33.480 align:middle line:84%
>>HARVEY: Oh, I think
this is a huge crisis.

00:27:33.480 --> 00:27:35.890 align:middle line:84%
And I think one
of the reasons why

00:27:35.890 --> 00:27:37.880 align:middle line:84%
we're so derelict
at the moment is

00:27:37.880 --> 00:27:40.530 align:middle line:84%
because the relationship
between men and women

00:27:40.530 --> 00:27:42.495 align:middle line:90%
is at a very low ebb.

00:27:42.495 --> 00:27:44.970 align:middle line:84%
There's so much suspicion,
and anger, and rage, and--

00:27:44.970 --> 00:27:45.860 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Confusion.

00:27:45.860 --> 00:27:47.580 align:middle line:84%
>>HARVEY: --and
confusion on both sides.

00:27:47.580 --> 00:27:47.900 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Absolutely.

00:27:47.900 --> 00:27:49.430 align:middle line:84%
Well, we're going
to get into that.

00:27:49.430 --> 00:27:52.510 align:middle line:84%
And I want to enter
that subject looking

00:27:52.510 --> 00:27:54.773 align:middle line:84%
at some of your
writings and some

00:27:54.773 --> 00:27:56.995 align:middle line:84%
of your lectures on
the Black Madonna

00:27:56.995 --> 00:27:58.491 align:middle line:84%
and what that
feminine force means.

00:27:58.491 --> 00:27:59.074 align:middle line:90%
>>HARVEY: Yes.

00:27:59.074 --> 00:28:00.005 align:middle line:90%
Oh my god, yes.

00:28:00.005 --> 00:28:01.130 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Very interesting.

00:28:01.130 --> 00:28:03.870 align:middle line:90%
We'll be back in just a moment.

00:28:03.870 --> 00:28:07.042 align:middle line:84%
Welcome to the next evolution
of Conscious Media Network.

00:28:07.042 --> 00:28:09.250 align:middle line:84%
Some of you have been with
us throughout our journey.

00:28:09.250 --> 00:28:13.100 align:middle line:84%
And now as a result of our
partnership with gaiamtv.com,

00:28:13.100 --> 00:28:15.150 align:middle line:84%
we're able to reach
more independent,

00:28:15.150 --> 00:28:17.120 align:middle line:90%
progressive thinkers like you.

00:28:17.120 --> 00:28:19.740 align:middle line:10%
In addition to the hundreds
of interviews for CMN,

00:28:19.740 --> 00:28:22.750 align:middle line:10%
I'm now able to do twice as
many interviews each month

00:28:22.750 --> 00:28:25.780 align:middle line:10%
with the leading visionaries
and authors of our time.

00:28:25.780 --> 00:28:29.320 align:middle line:10%
This is possible because of
Gaiam TV's genuine commitment

00:28:29.320 --> 00:28:32.874 align:middle line:10%
to preserve and expand this kind
of groundbreaking information.

00:28:32.874 --> 00:28:34.790 align:middle line:10%
>>JOAN BORYSENKO: I have
a great deal of faith

00:28:34.790 --> 00:28:37.440 align:middle line:10%
that this universe
is a friendly place.

00:28:37.440 --> 00:28:39.330 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: In fact,
gaiamtv.com is

00:28:39.330 --> 00:28:42.470 align:middle line:84%
destined to become the largest
portal of conscious media

00:28:42.470 --> 00:28:43.970 align:middle line:90%
intended to awaken and inspire.

00:28:43.970 --> 00:28:46.095 align:middle line:10%
>>JEAN HOUSTON: We don't
just live in the universe,

00:28:46.095 --> 00:28:47.771 align:middle line:10%
the universe lives in us.

00:28:47.771 --> 00:28:50.020 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: I could not be
happier with this partnership

00:28:50.020 --> 00:28:52.214 align:middle line:84%
and the possibilities that
lie ahead for all of us.

00:28:52.214 --> 00:28:53.630 align:middle line:10%
>>JOE DISPENZA:
Most people really

00:28:53.630 --> 00:28:56.960 align:middle line:10%
are thinking the same way
every day, acting the same way,

00:28:56.960 --> 00:28:59.356 align:middle line:10%
and feeling the same way,
but really hoping something

00:28:59.356 --> 00:29:01.730 align:middle line:10%
will show up differently in
their life and it never does.

00:29:01.730 --> 00:29:04.420 align:middle line:10%
>>REGINA: Other well-known faces
in the alternative media scene

00:29:04.420 --> 00:29:06.825 align:middle line:10%
will also be collaborating
with gaiamtv.com

00:29:06.825 --> 00:29:08.374 align:middle line:10%
to provide even
more perspectives.

00:29:08.374 --> 00:29:09.790 align:middle line:10%
>>RICHARD HOAGLAND:
Did the Mayans

00:29:09.790 --> 00:29:13.096 align:middle line:10%
understand about
hyperdimensional torsion field

00:29:13.096 --> 00:29:14.700 align:middle line:10%
physics?

00:29:14.700 --> 00:29:17.850 align:middle line:90%
I think I can prove they did.

00:29:17.850 --> 00:29:20.460 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: In addition to my
live interviews from Gaiam TV's

00:29:20.460 --> 00:29:22.720 align:middle line:84%
studios, Scott and I
will still be traveling

00:29:22.720 --> 00:29:25.002 align:middle line:84%
around the world for other
exclusive interviews.

00:29:25.002 --> 00:29:27.210 align:middle line:10%
>>HARVEY BIGELSEN: You got
pharmaceutical commercials

00:29:27.210 --> 00:29:29.050 align:middle line:10%
telling you go to
see your doctor this,

00:29:29.050 --> 00:29:31.120 align:middle line:10%
go to tell you doctor that.

00:29:31.120 --> 00:29:32.272 align:middle line:10%
It's a brainwashing.

00:29:32.272 --> 00:29:33.980 align:middle line:10%
>>REGINA: Meanwhile,
I wanted to give you

00:29:33.980 --> 00:29:36.770 align:middle line:10%
a quick preview of
gaiamtv.com, so you

00:29:36.770 --> 00:29:38.670 align:middle line:10%
can see what's being
made available for you

00:29:38.670 --> 00:29:40.222 align:middle line:10%
as a result of this partnership.

00:29:40.222 --> 00:29:42.180 align:middle line:10%
>>MICHAEL TELLINGER: This
is in the late 1400s.

00:29:42.180 --> 00:29:44.480 align:middle line:10%
When they asked the
local African tribes,

00:29:44.480 --> 00:29:46.390 align:middle line:10%
who built these structures?

00:29:46.390 --> 00:29:48.160 align:middle line:90%
The answer was, we don't know.

00:29:48.160 --> 00:29:50.690 align:middle line:84%
Now, that is not what you'll
read in history books today.

00:29:50.690 --> 00:29:52.240 align:middle line:90%
I have a big problem with that.

00:29:52.240 --> 00:29:55.480 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: You'll find curated
consciousness-expanding films,

00:29:55.480 --> 00:29:59.860 align:middle line:84%
thought-provoking
documentaries, engaging TV show,

00:29:59.860 --> 00:30:02.150 align:middle line:90%
and much more.

00:30:02.150 --> 00:30:05.120 align:middle line:84%
Please join us for the next
evolution of conscious media.

00:30:05.120 --> 00:30:19.321 align:middle line:90%


00:30:19.321 --> 00:30:19.820 align:middle line:90%
All right.

00:30:19.820 --> 00:30:22.278 align:middle line:84%
We're back and we're going to
talk about the Black Madonna.

00:30:22.278 --> 00:30:25.670 align:middle line:10%
Many people don't know the
notion of the Black Madonna.

00:30:25.670 --> 00:30:28.240 align:middle line:10%
And this is something
that is-- it's

00:30:28.240 --> 00:30:31.490 align:middle line:10%
a part of Christian mysticism
which has been hidden away

00:30:31.490 --> 00:30:34.590 align:middle line:10%
behind some other veil when
you're going to your Sunday

00:30:34.590 --> 00:30:36.170 align:middle line:10%
school lessons and so forth.

00:30:36.170 --> 00:30:36.760 align:middle line:84%
>>HARVEY: No, they don't
talk about the Black Madonna

00:30:36.760 --> 00:30:36.960 align:middle line:90%
at Sunday school.

00:30:36.960 --> 00:30:38.175 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: In the
Protestant world.

00:30:38.175 --> 00:30:38.480 align:middle line:90%
>>HARVEY: No.

00:30:38.480 --> 00:30:38.760 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: No.

00:30:38.760 --> 00:30:41.051 align:middle line:84%
I never heard of the Black--
I didn't hear of the Black

00:30:41.051 --> 00:30:42.950 align:middle line:84%
Madonna until about
10 years ago myself.

00:30:42.950 --> 00:30:45.420 align:middle line:84%
So some people may
already be feeling

00:30:45.420 --> 00:30:49.170 align:middle line:84%
intimidated at what's about
to come up, but explain to us

00:30:49.170 --> 00:30:50.740 align:middle line:90%
what the Black Madonna is.

00:30:50.740 --> 00:30:54.070 align:middle line:84%
And then I'd like you to
give us a full understanding

00:30:54.070 --> 00:30:56.930 align:middle line:84%
of this aspect of
femininity that

00:30:56.930 --> 00:31:01.210 align:middle line:84%
can both annihilate
and resurrect.

00:31:01.210 --> 00:31:02.930 align:middle line:90%
>>HARVEY: Wow.

00:31:02.930 --> 00:31:07.075 align:middle line:10%
Well, I was born in India, and
one of the earliest statutes

00:31:07.075 --> 00:31:10.290 align:middle line:10%
that I remember seeing was the
statue of the Indian goddess

00:31:10.290 --> 00:31:11.390 align:middle line:10%
Kali.

00:31:11.390 --> 00:31:16.510 align:middle line:10%
And she had her tongue out,
dripping with red paint.

00:31:16.510 --> 00:31:18.990 align:middle line:10%
And she had a garland of skulls.

00:31:18.990 --> 00:31:21.625 align:middle line:84%
And I remember turning to the
Hindu priest and saying my god,

00:31:21.625 --> 00:31:23.930 align:middle line:90%
she's so terrible.

00:31:23.930 --> 00:31:25.520 align:middle line:90%
He said no.

00:31:25.520 --> 00:31:29.380 align:middle line:90%
Love kills to rebirth.

00:31:29.380 --> 00:31:31.280 align:middle line:90%
Look at nature.

00:31:31.280 --> 00:31:37.380 align:middle line:84%
Things die, and things grow out
of the dead mulch of the dead.

00:31:37.380 --> 00:31:39.780 align:middle line:84%
So the whole
universe is actually

00:31:39.780 --> 00:31:45.180 align:middle line:84%
this Kali process of
death and rebirth.

00:31:45.180 --> 00:31:48.730 align:middle line:84%
The problem with our
vision of the feminine,

00:31:48.730 --> 00:31:51.090 align:middle line:84%
and the patriarchal
vision of the feminine,

00:31:51.090 --> 00:31:56.320 align:middle line:84%
is that it allows the sweet,
passive, gentle, protective,

00:31:56.320 --> 00:31:59.540 align:middle line:84%
loving, nurturing
feminine, because that

00:31:59.540 --> 00:32:01.457 align:middle line:84%
suits the patriarchy to
have a vision of that.

00:32:01.457 --> 00:32:02.581 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Loving and loyal.

00:32:02.581 --> 00:32:03.500 align:middle line:90%
>>HARVEY: And loyal.

00:32:03.500 --> 00:32:05.170 align:middle line:90%
Endlessly loyal.

00:32:05.170 --> 00:32:07.900 align:middle line:84%
But the other side of the
feminine, which is obvious

00:32:07.900 --> 00:32:09.920 align:middle line:84%
when you just stare
out of the window

00:32:09.920 --> 00:32:12.730 align:middle line:84%
and look at a field or
the lightning storm,

00:32:12.730 --> 00:32:16.010 align:middle line:84%
which is that she,
nature, the divine mother,

00:32:16.010 --> 00:32:21.490 align:middle line:84%
is also ferocious, terrifying,
destroying to recreate.

00:32:21.490 --> 00:32:24.190 align:middle line:90%
That is absolutely verboten.

00:32:24.190 --> 00:32:27.420 align:middle line:84%
You can't think about that
because if you connect

00:32:27.420 --> 00:32:29.430 align:middle line:84%
with that side of her
as well as the loving,

00:32:29.430 --> 00:32:31.060 align:middle line:90%
protective side of her,

00:32:31.060 --> 00:32:34.410 align:middle line:84%
then you connect with
her tremendous passion

00:32:34.410 --> 00:32:37.860 align:middle line:84%
energy, her creativity,
her wildness,

00:32:37.860 --> 00:32:40.630 align:middle line:84%
her capacity to say
these structures

00:32:40.630 --> 00:32:44.500 align:middle line:84%
that you have created
are killing the planet.

00:32:44.500 --> 00:32:45.870 align:middle line:90%
You are destroying beauty.

00:32:45.870 --> 00:32:47.242 align:middle line:90%
You're destroying justice.

00:32:47.242 --> 00:32:48.450 align:middle line:90%
You're destroying compassion.

00:32:48.450 --> 00:32:52.050 align:middle line:84%
And I am not going to
let you get away with it.

00:32:52.050 --> 00:32:56.120 align:middle line:84%
And it's when a human being,
male or female, that connects

00:32:56.120 --> 00:33:00.610 align:middle line:84%
with the passion energy, the
dark creativity, the wildness,

00:33:00.610 --> 00:33:06.960 align:middle line:84%
the agony, the heartbreak,
the potential transformatory

00:33:06.960 --> 00:33:10.750 align:middle line:84%
power of the dark Madonna,
the Black Madonna,

00:33:10.750 --> 00:33:14.950 align:middle line:84%
that you have the birth
of the rebels of love.

00:33:14.950 --> 00:33:18.030 align:middle line:84%
The divine lovers who
cannot be controlled.

00:33:18.030 --> 00:33:21.110 align:middle line:84%
So the Black Madonna, when you
understand her in that way,

00:33:21.110 --> 00:33:26.390 align:middle line:84%
is a force of such
overwhelming empowerment.

00:33:26.390 --> 00:33:28.460 align:middle line:84%
And how it happened
in Christianity

00:33:28.460 --> 00:33:32.460 align:middle line:84%
is that Mary was
given the sweet role.

00:33:32.460 --> 00:33:34.660 align:middle line:84%
But if you look at
Mary in the Bible,

00:33:34.660 --> 00:33:36.340 align:middle line:84%
you realize Mary
was one tough broad.

00:33:36.340 --> 00:33:39.440 align:middle line:84%
The Magnificat is a call
for total revolution.

00:33:39.440 --> 00:33:41.610 align:middle line:84%
She's calling in that
wonderful statement

00:33:41.610 --> 00:33:43.322 align:middle line:84%
that she gives out
to the-- she's been

00:33:43.322 --> 00:33:44.905 align:middle line:84%
told that she's going
to birth Christ.

00:33:44.905 --> 00:33:48.870 align:middle line:84%
She's calling for a
social revolution,

00:33:48.870 --> 00:33:51.250 align:middle line:84%
an economic revolution,
and a mystical revolution.

00:33:51.250 --> 00:33:53.667 align:middle line:84%
It's the most radical statement
in the whole of the Bible.

00:33:53.667 --> 00:33:54.999 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: What is the statement?

00:33:54.999 --> 00:33:56.130 align:middle line:90%
Do you happen to recall it?

00:33:56.130 --> 00:33:58.130 align:middle line:84%
>>HARVEY: Well, "My soul
doth magnify the Lord."

00:33:58.130 --> 00:34:01.530 align:middle line:84%
And she says, "And the rich
shall be sent empty away."

00:34:01.530 --> 00:34:04.600 align:middle line:84%
She's talking about the birth
of a Christ consciousness

00:34:04.600 --> 00:34:09.010 align:middle line:84%
that is going to help people
see the games of the elite,

00:34:09.010 --> 00:34:11.330 align:middle line:84%
the games of the powerful,
the games of the rich.

00:34:11.330 --> 00:34:14.711 align:middle line:84%
And how they kill life
and totally destroy.

00:34:14.711 --> 00:34:16.585 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: The same issues
we're facing today.

00:34:16.585 --> 00:34:18.530 align:middle line:84%
>>HARVEY: This is
the human madness.

00:34:18.530 --> 00:34:21.880 align:middle line:84%
And she was very much
both the Black Madonna

00:34:21.880 --> 00:34:23.610 align:middle line:90%
and the tender one.

00:34:23.610 --> 00:34:26.949 align:middle line:84%
But they didn't want that power
to be accessible through her.

00:34:26.949 --> 00:34:29.900 align:middle line:84%
So they created a fake
or partial feminine.

00:34:29.900 --> 00:34:32.840 align:middle line:84%
But that didn't stop the
adoration of the Black Madonna

00:34:32.840 --> 00:34:35.460 align:middle line:84%
because, if you go to
Chartres, for example,

00:34:35.460 --> 00:34:40.320 align:middle line:84%
in the crypt of Chartres, where
they used to, in ancient days,

00:34:40.320 --> 00:34:42.150 align:middle line:84%
in druidic times
before Christianity,

00:34:42.150 --> 00:34:45.449 align:middle line:84%
worship the divine
mother as a dark mother,

00:34:45.449 --> 00:34:47.350 align:middle line:90%
constantly giving birth.

00:34:47.350 --> 00:34:49.977 align:middle line:84%
Now in the last 700
years, she's being

00:34:49.977 --> 00:34:51.310 align:middle line:90%
worshipped as the Black Madonna.

00:34:51.310 --> 00:34:54.450 align:middle line:84%
So it's the Black Madonna
has taken this ancient power

00:34:54.450 --> 00:34:58.220 align:middle line:84%
and kept it alive within
a patriarchal tradition.

00:34:58.220 --> 00:35:01.720 align:middle line:10%
But for those of us who
are aware at this moment

00:35:01.720 --> 00:35:05.020 align:middle line:10%
of the enormous importance
of getting into connection

00:35:05.020 --> 00:35:08.020 align:middle line:10%
with Kali, since
this is a Kali time,

00:35:08.020 --> 00:35:11.230 align:middle line:10%
we're being destroyed
to be recreated.

00:35:11.230 --> 00:35:14.000 align:middle line:10%
We're being annihilated
to be reborn.

00:35:14.000 --> 00:35:20.030 align:middle line:10%
We're being shattered
to be remade whole.

00:35:20.030 --> 00:35:24.140 align:middle line:84%
And if you don't worship
the process of shattering,

00:35:24.140 --> 00:35:25.980 align:middle line:84%
and annihilation,
and destruction,

00:35:25.980 --> 00:35:29.967 align:middle line:84%
and know that it is sacred,
it can drive you crazy.

00:35:29.967 --> 00:35:30.550 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:35:30.550 --> 00:35:31.841 align:middle line:90%
>>HARVEY: It can drive you mad.

00:35:31.841 --> 00:35:35.930 align:middle line:84%
But if you know that
there is a divine meaning,

00:35:35.930 --> 00:35:39.870 align:middle line:84%
then you can stay steady
and allow the destruction

00:35:39.870 --> 00:35:42.120 align:middle line:84%
to happen so that the
great birth that's

00:35:42.120 --> 00:35:45.030 align:middle line:84%
being planned by the
divine can take place.

00:35:45.030 --> 00:35:47.470 align:middle line:84%
And that's a knowledge only
the Black Madonna can give you

00:35:47.470 --> 00:35:51.050 align:middle line:84%
because she is the one who
guards the key to this.

00:35:51.050 --> 00:35:54.120 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Which aspects
of mystical Christianity

00:35:54.120 --> 00:35:57.240 align:middle line:84%
have kept this story
alive and follow this?

00:35:57.240 --> 00:35:59.992 align:middle line:84%
Which sects or cults,
or-- how would you?

00:35:59.992 --> 00:36:01.950 align:middle line:84%
>>HARVEY: Well, Mary has
always been worshipped

00:36:01.950 --> 00:36:04.510 align:middle line:84%
by the ones who knew her
not just as the sweet one,

00:36:04.510 --> 00:36:08.484 align:middle line:84%
but also as the fierce one
and as the queen of justice.

00:36:08.484 --> 00:36:10.400 align:middle line:84%
So there's been an aspect
of the Black Madonna

00:36:10.400 --> 00:36:12.860 align:middle line:84%
that's been kept
alive through that.

00:36:12.860 --> 00:36:16.600 align:middle line:84%
But I think the great resurgence
of interest in the Black

00:36:16.600 --> 00:36:19.920 align:middle line:84%
Madonna is a modern phenomenon
because people like Marion

00:36:19.920 --> 00:36:23.000 align:middle line:84%
Woodman, and the work I've
done, and other people who

00:36:23.000 --> 00:36:26.120 align:middle line:84%
are passionate about this aspect
of the feminine that has really

00:36:26.120 --> 00:36:27.480 align:middle line:90%
brought her out.

00:36:27.480 --> 00:36:30.144 align:middle line:84%
And the reason is, as I said,
we're in a Black Madonna time.

00:36:30.144 --> 00:36:31.060 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes, we are.

00:36:31.060 --> 00:36:34.600 align:middle line:84%
>>HARVEY: Kali is dancing and
we've got to pay attention.

00:36:34.600 --> 00:36:37.880 align:middle line:84%
And we've got to love her
even in her terrible moods

00:36:37.880 --> 00:36:41.196 align:middle line:84%
because then she'll be able to
teach us how to survive her.

00:36:41.196 --> 00:36:42.570 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: In this
book, you speak

00:36:42.570 --> 00:36:45.740 align:middle line:84%
of another-- I think
it was an encounter you

00:36:45.740 --> 00:36:48.760 align:middle line:84%
had as a child in India, where
someone was explaining Kali

00:36:48.760 --> 00:36:49.360 align:middle line:90%
to you.

00:36:49.360 --> 00:36:51.480 align:middle line:84%
And it was the different
representation,

00:36:51.480 --> 00:36:54.340 align:middle line:84%
where she, again, had
the red paint, the blood,

00:36:54.340 --> 00:36:55.507 align:middle line:90%
and she had a baby.

00:36:55.507 --> 00:36:56.090 align:middle line:90%
>>HARVEY: Yes.

00:36:56.090 --> 00:36:57.720 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Can you
explain that one.

00:36:57.720 --> 00:36:59.360 align:middle line:84%
I mean that one,
just reading it--

00:36:59.360 --> 00:37:00.032 align:middle line:90%
>>HARVEY: Ramakrishna, yeah.

00:37:00.032 --> 00:37:00.615 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:37:00.615 --> 00:37:02.670 align:middle line:84%
And it terrifies
you on one hand.

00:37:02.670 --> 00:37:08.350 align:middle line:84%
But the whole while, she had
this beautiful, ecstatic smile.

00:37:08.350 --> 00:37:09.225 align:middle line:90%
What is this image?

00:37:09.225 --> 00:37:10.550 align:middle line:90%
>>HARVEY: Well, it's-- oh god.

00:37:10.550 --> 00:37:12.510 align:middle line:84%
This is one of the
highest and most difficult

00:37:12.510 --> 00:37:14.480 align:middle line:84%
teachings I think for
anybody to really grasp.

00:37:14.480 --> 00:37:14.570 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:37:14.570 --> 00:37:16.000 align:middle line:90%
>>HARVEY: For the ego to grasp.

00:37:16.000 --> 00:37:18.890 align:middle line:84%
Ramakrishna was asked, I
think it was by Vivekananda.

00:37:18.890 --> 00:37:21.900 align:middle line:84%
Ramakrishna, great 19th
century Bengalian mystic,

00:37:21.900 --> 00:37:25.450 align:middle line:84%
who was one of the greatest
spiritual pioneers in history.

00:37:25.450 --> 00:37:28.840 align:middle line:84%
He really opened up the
vision of the divine mother

00:37:28.840 --> 00:37:30.280 align:middle line:90%
for our time.

00:37:30.280 --> 00:37:32.880 align:middle line:84%
And he was asked,
what is the mother?

00:37:32.880 --> 00:37:35.800 align:middle line:84%
And he said, "Oh, I had
a vision of her one day.

00:37:35.800 --> 00:37:39.040 align:middle line:84%
I was on the beach and I saw
this gorgeous naked woman who

00:37:39.040 --> 00:37:41.670 align:middle line:84%
was pregnant come
out of the waves.

00:37:41.670 --> 00:37:46.030 align:middle line:84%
And she walked towards me on
the beach and sat next to me.

00:37:46.030 --> 00:37:49.010 align:middle line:84%
And then she gave
birth in ecstasy.

00:37:49.010 --> 00:37:52.780 align:middle line:84%
And then with the same
ecstasy, she devoured her child

00:37:52.780 --> 00:37:55.710 align:middle line:84%
until the blood was
running down her body.

00:37:55.710 --> 00:37:59.620 align:middle line:84%
And then with the same ecstasy,
she went back into the waters.

00:37:59.620 --> 00:38:02.100 align:middle line:84%
And then, of course,
she rose again."

00:38:02.100 --> 00:38:06.130 align:middle line:84%
And what he was seeing in
that form, in that image,

00:38:06.130 --> 00:38:09.100 align:middle line:84%
in that film,
really, is the nature

00:38:09.100 --> 00:38:12.740 align:middle line:84%
of the creative process
of the universe.

00:38:12.740 --> 00:38:14.400 align:middle line:84%
The creative process
in the universe

00:38:14.400 --> 00:38:17.270 align:middle line:84%
takes as much delight in
destruction as in creation

00:38:17.270 --> 00:38:20.475 align:middle line:84%
because it knows instinctually
that what is-- it's the new.

00:38:20.475 --> 00:38:21.180 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Our bodies
on cellular level.

00:38:21.180 --> 00:38:21.585 align:middle line:90%
>>HARVEY: That's right.

00:38:21.585 --> 00:38:22.340 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Anabolism, catabolism.

00:38:22.340 --> 00:38:22.690 align:middle line:90%
>>HARVEY: That's it.

00:38:22.690 --> 00:38:24.481 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: We're always
dying and rebirthing

00:38:24.481 --> 00:38:25.430 align:middle line:90%
on the cellular level.

00:38:25.430 --> 00:38:26.388 align:middle line:90%
>>HARVEY: That's right.

00:38:26.388 --> 00:38:29.535 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: But when I read that,
it left me virtually paralyzed.

00:38:29.535 --> 00:38:30.410 align:middle line:90%
>>HARVEY: It's scary.

00:38:30.410 --> 00:38:31.368 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: It was scary.

00:38:31.368 --> 00:38:35.170 align:middle line:84%
But I also, in my
own mind, I kept

00:38:35.170 --> 00:38:38.510 align:middle line:84%
connecting with that ecstatic
essence that was behind it.

00:38:38.510 --> 00:38:40.740 align:middle line:84%
And it's so gruesome
on one hand.

00:38:40.740 --> 00:38:43.410 align:middle line:84%
But that ecstasy
you can understand

00:38:43.410 --> 00:38:45.359 align:middle line:84%
that there is no
judgment on either one.

00:38:45.359 --> 00:38:46.275 align:middle line:90%
>>HARVEY: No judgment.

00:38:46.275 --> 00:38:47.566 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Birth or destruction.

00:38:47.566 --> 00:38:50.773 align:middle line:84%
>>HARVEY: Yes, because
it's the divine doing both.

00:38:50.773 --> 00:38:51.600 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:38:51.600 --> 00:38:53.660 align:middle line:84%
>>HARVEY: And the
divine is at play

00:38:53.660 --> 00:38:55.980 align:middle line:90%
in the deeper sense in both.

00:38:55.980 --> 00:38:59.130 align:middle line:84%
And to be able to
survive a time like this,

00:38:59.130 --> 00:39:01.870 align:middle line:84%
and it's going to get
much hairier-- we're

00:39:01.870 --> 00:39:05.410 align:middle line:84%
going into the eye of the
evolutionary storm-- we're

00:39:05.410 --> 00:39:08.915 align:middle line:84%
going to have to find the smile
of Kali, the smile of Sheba,

00:39:08.915 --> 00:39:12.870 align:middle line:84%
the silent smile of the Buddha,
because that's the smile that

00:39:12.870 --> 00:39:16.950 align:middle line:84%
initiates you into the core of
divine peace, and stillness,

00:39:16.950 --> 00:39:20.740 align:middle line:90%
and inner unshakability.

00:39:20.740 --> 00:39:25.680 align:middle line:84%
Because when the world is
being torn apart, if all of you

00:39:25.680 --> 00:39:27.510 align:middle line:84%
is also being torn
apart, you become

00:39:27.510 --> 00:39:30.700 align:middle line:84%
crazy and absolutely
ineffectual.

00:39:30.700 --> 00:39:33.710 align:middle line:84%
What is needed, and
for all of us, I think,

00:39:33.710 --> 00:39:37.980 align:middle line:84%
is to marry the deepest peace
with that greatest passion.

00:39:37.980 --> 00:39:41.044 align:middle line:84%
The deepest piece of the father
with the wildest and clearest

00:39:41.044 --> 00:39:41.960 align:middle line:90%
passion of the mother.

00:39:41.960 --> 00:39:43.060 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Transcendence
and eminence, yes.

00:39:43.060 --> 00:39:43.559 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

00:39:43.559 --> 00:39:45.749 align:middle line:90%


00:39:45.749 --> 00:39:47.540 align:middle line:84%
>>HARVEY: And then we
will be able, really,

00:39:47.540 --> 00:39:50.010 align:middle line:84%
to become rebels of love
and sacred activists

00:39:50.010 --> 00:39:51.350 align:middle line:90%
in this situation.

00:39:51.350 --> 00:39:53.320 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Even if someone
doesn't understand

00:39:53.320 --> 00:39:55.890 align:middle line:84%
the degree of passion that
you possess because they've

00:39:55.890 --> 00:39:58.495 align:middle line:84%
lost theirs, we do
understand one thing:

00:39:58.495 --> 00:40:01.270 align:middle line:84%
societal agendas and structures
are collapsing around us

00:40:01.270 --> 00:40:01.770 align:middle line:90%
by the day.

00:40:01.770 --> 00:40:02.692 align:middle line:90%
>>HARVEY: Yes.

00:40:02.692 --> 00:40:04.150 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: The
revelations of what's

00:40:04.150 --> 00:40:05.500 align:middle line:90%
taken place in the church.

00:40:05.500 --> 00:40:06.700 align:middle line:90%
The cruelty to children.

00:40:06.700 --> 00:40:07.825 align:middle line:90%
The abuse of them sexually.

00:40:07.825 --> 00:40:08.970 align:middle line:90%
>>HARVEY: And animals.

00:40:08.970 --> 00:40:10.220 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: And animals.

00:40:10.220 --> 00:40:13.349 align:middle line:84%
And the abuse of the
financial systems.

00:40:13.349 --> 00:40:15.265 align:middle line:84%
As you say, keeping most
of the world paupers.

00:40:15.265 --> 00:40:16.690 align:middle line:84%
>>HARVEY: Abuse is
putting it mildly, yes.

00:40:16.690 --> 00:40:17.440 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Exactly.

00:40:17.440 --> 00:40:20.340 align:middle line:84%
We see the educational
system, which

00:40:20.340 --> 00:40:22.870 align:middle line:84%
is essentially
worthless any longer.

00:40:22.870 --> 00:40:27.000 align:middle line:84%
We can all see these structures
not only are crumbling,

00:40:27.000 --> 00:40:28.370 align:middle line:90%
they have to collapse.

00:40:28.370 --> 00:40:30.300 align:middle line:84%
Anyone watching
this knows that it

00:40:30.300 --> 00:40:32.335 align:middle line:84%
has to collapse to give
way to something better.

00:40:32.335 --> 00:40:32.940 align:middle line:90%
>>HARVEY: Yes.

00:40:32.940 --> 00:40:34.981 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And so let's
talk about the degradation

00:40:34.981 --> 00:40:35.630 align:middle line:90%
of the planet.

00:40:35.630 --> 00:40:38.050 align:middle line:84%
You say the Black Madonna
energy, the essence,

00:40:38.050 --> 00:40:41.780 align:middle line:84%
that feminine essence
of the two-faced godhead

00:40:41.780 --> 00:40:45.010 align:middle line:84%
has to take us through
this annihilation.

00:40:45.010 --> 00:40:48.130 align:middle line:84%
But is there a moment at
which we can recover ourselves

00:40:48.130 --> 00:40:50.565 align:middle line:84%
before complete
annihilation, in your view?

00:40:50.565 --> 00:40:52.390 align:middle line:84%
>>HARVEY: Well, when
I say annihilation,

00:40:52.390 --> 00:40:54.085 align:middle line:84%
I'm not talking about,
thank god, the annihilation

00:40:54.085 --> 00:40:54.160 align:middle line:90%
of the planet.

00:40:54.160 --> 00:40:56.320 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: The total
annihilation of humanity, right.

00:40:56.320 --> 00:40:57.760 align:middle line:84%
>>HARVEY: But what
I think is happening

00:40:57.760 --> 00:40:59.230 align:middle line:84%
is that we're going
through what I

00:40:59.230 --> 00:41:01.720 align:middle line:90%
would call a global dark night.

00:41:01.720 --> 00:41:05.510 align:middle line:84%
In the mystical path
at the higher levels,

00:41:05.510 --> 00:41:08.070 align:middle line:84%
when you're very
sincere, you're not

00:41:08.070 --> 00:41:09.760 align:middle line:84%
rewarded as "The
Secret" would claim,

00:41:09.760 --> 00:41:12.330 align:middle line:84%
by McMansions, and
Mercedes-Benzes,

00:41:12.330 --> 00:41:13.720 align:middle line:90%
and Cuban lovers, alas.

00:41:13.720 --> 00:41:14.470 align:middle line:90%
That would be fun.

00:41:14.470 --> 00:41:18.440 align:middle line:84%
But what in fact happens is
that you are torn apart by God.

00:41:18.440 --> 00:41:20.340 align:middle line:84%
And you're given a
series of ordeals

00:41:20.340 --> 00:41:22.260 align:middle line:84%
that deconstructs
your ego so you

00:41:22.260 --> 00:41:25.000 align:middle line:84%
can be free to become
your divine self.

00:41:25.000 --> 00:41:29.840 align:middle line:84%
This is an excruciating,
horrible, mad, dreadful process

00:41:29.840 --> 00:41:30.690 align:middle line:90%
as it's happening.

00:41:30.690 --> 00:41:34.520 align:middle line:84%
But it's a sublime, and
amazing wonder and miracle

00:41:34.520 --> 00:41:37.290 align:middle line:84%
because through it, a wholly new
kind of human being is created.

00:41:37.290 --> 00:41:39.290 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: It's as though
Kali's eating her baby.

00:41:39.290 --> 00:41:40.170 align:middle line:90%
>>HARVEY: Yes.

00:41:40.170 --> 00:41:42.170 align:middle line:90%
It's like Jesus being crucified.

00:41:42.170 --> 00:41:43.440 align:middle line:90%
But look what happened.

00:41:43.440 --> 00:41:46.190 align:middle line:84%
It's like Rumi being shattered
at the death of Shams,

00:41:46.190 --> 00:41:46.740 align:middle line:90%
going mad.

00:41:46.740 --> 00:41:49.539 align:middle line:84%
And yet, that giving birth to
the greatest mystical poetry

00:41:49.539 --> 00:41:51.580 align:middle line:84%
the world's ever seen and
to a being who radiated

00:41:51.580 --> 00:41:52.960 align:middle line:90%
love through his whole world.

00:41:52.960 --> 00:41:56.220 align:middle line:84%
And I had been through
something like that myself.

00:41:56.220 --> 00:42:00.300 align:middle line:84%
So what I see is
the process, which

00:42:00.300 --> 00:42:02.780 align:middle line:90%
is a process of divine love.

00:42:02.780 --> 00:42:05.820 align:middle line:84%
But one aspect of this
love is killing the false,

00:42:05.820 --> 00:42:09.460 align:middle line:84%
killing what is now
destroying us, in order

00:42:09.460 --> 00:42:12.760 align:middle line:84%
to release us, liberate
us, transform us

00:42:12.760 --> 00:42:15.530 align:middle line:84%
so that we can
become conscience,

00:42:15.530 --> 00:42:21.250 align:middle line:84%
co-creative, grace-filled,
agents of divine evolution.

00:42:21.250 --> 00:42:22.410 align:middle line:90%
It looks horrific.

00:42:22.410 --> 00:42:23.360 align:middle line:90%
It is horrific.

00:42:23.360 --> 00:42:25.780 align:middle line:90%
It feels sometimes horrific.

00:42:25.780 --> 00:42:29.360 align:middle line:84%
There is no escape from it and
we are going to go through it.

00:42:29.360 --> 00:42:33.660 align:middle line:84%
But when you have a larger
vision through the grace

00:42:33.660 --> 00:42:36.560 align:middle line:84%
of the mother and see that
this cannot be avoided now,

00:42:36.560 --> 00:42:40.110 align:middle line:84%
but we can build the
structures that can weather it.

00:42:40.110 --> 00:42:43.040 align:middle line:84%
And we can find through
grace that inner peace

00:42:43.040 --> 00:42:45.940 align:middle line:84%
that can enable us not
to go mad through such

00:42:45.940 --> 00:42:47.370 align:middle line:90%
an extreme process.

00:42:47.370 --> 00:42:50.205 align:middle line:84%
Then you see with
amazing gratitude

00:42:50.205 --> 00:42:52.310 align:middle line:84%
just how astonishing
a time this is.

00:42:52.310 --> 00:42:55.990 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Because you also say
that the Black Madonna is the,

00:42:55.990 --> 00:42:59.354 align:middle line:84%
as it said in the book,
absolute and final compassion.

00:42:59.354 --> 00:43:00.145 align:middle line:90%
>>HARVEY: Complete.

00:43:00.145 --> 00:43:01.580 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Above and
beyond everything else--

00:43:01.580 --> 00:43:01.870 align:middle line:90%
>>HARVEY: Everything.

00:43:01.870 --> 00:43:02.810 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: --is underneath it.

00:43:02.810 --> 00:43:04.460 align:middle line:84%
No matter what
we're going through,

00:43:04.460 --> 00:43:06.095 align:middle line:84%
that is the compassionate
force of the universe.

00:43:06.095 --> 00:43:06.950 align:middle line:90%
>>HARVEY: That's it.

00:43:06.950 --> 00:43:08.950 align:middle line:84%
Well, only a love like
that would have the right

00:43:08.950 --> 00:43:11.550 align:middle line:84%
to do such terrible things
to us because it is absolute.

00:43:11.550 --> 00:43:14.140 align:middle line:84%
And also a love
like that knows what

00:43:14.140 --> 00:43:19.240 align:middle line:84%
we can become if only we
consent to die to the full self.

00:43:19.240 --> 00:43:22.840 align:middle line:84%
Nobody wants to die to the ego
and it's a horrible process.

00:43:22.840 --> 00:43:24.760 align:middle line:84%
But the one who
knows that there's

00:43:24.760 --> 00:43:29.410 align:middle line:84%
a totally different divine life
with amazing beauty awaiting

00:43:29.410 --> 00:43:34.390 align:middle line:84%
you when your ego has begun to
become transparent to the self

00:43:34.390 --> 00:43:37.100 align:middle line:84%
will force you to go through
all sorts of ordeals.

00:43:37.100 --> 00:43:39.420 align:middle line:84%
Not to punish you, but to
release you, liberate you,

00:43:39.420 --> 00:43:42.180 align:middle line:84%
give you a whole
new miraculous life.

00:43:42.180 --> 00:43:45.767 align:middle line:84%
And that, I think, is what's
being prepared for humanity.

00:43:45.767 --> 00:43:46.850 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: And at the same.

00:43:46.850 --> 00:43:49.400 align:middle line:84%
>>HARVEY: And for the, thank
god, the rest of nature

00:43:49.400 --> 00:43:51.050 align:middle line:84%
because if we
continue as we are,

00:43:51.050 --> 00:43:55.020 align:middle line:84%
we're psychopathic
destroyers, and not the lovers

00:43:55.020 --> 00:43:57.270 align:middle line:84%
and guardians that I
think, I believe, I

00:43:57.270 --> 00:44:00.500 align:middle line:84%
know we were meant to be
and are in our hearts.

00:44:00.500 --> 00:44:01.660 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:44:01.660 --> 00:44:05.910 align:middle line:84%
And when we talk about the
kind of neutering of the male

00:44:05.910 --> 00:44:10.222 align:middle line:84%
and also of the female, we're
looking at-- let's just talk.

00:44:10.222 --> 00:44:11.430 align:middle line:90%
You and I just talk about it.

00:44:11.430 --> 00:44:13.350 align:middle line:84%
>>HARVEY: The male has
turned into a robot,

00:44:13.350 --> 00:44:16.370 align:middle line:84%
and the woman is turned
into either a hysteric

00:44:16.370 --> 00:44:19.770 align:middle line:84%
or a tamped-down,
denatured female.

00:44:19.770 --> 00:44:21.442 align:middle line:84%
And both are destroyed
in that process.

00:44:21.442 --> 00:44:22.650 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Both are destroyed.

00:44:22.650 --> 00:44:25.400 align:middle line:84%
And we're looking at very
specific agendas that do that.

00:44:25.400 --> 00:44:26.840 align:middle line:84%
One has been going
on a long time.

00:44:26.840 --> 00:44:28.980 align:middle line:84%
You and I talked
off camera about it.

00:44:28.980 --> 00:44:32.960 align:middle line:84%
About this incredible
self-hatred women

00:44:32.960 --> 00:44:36.120 align:middle line:84%
go through just on a
physical level in the West

00:44:36.120 --> 00:44:38.669 align:middle line:84%
because of what has been
idealized in the media.

00:44:38.669 --> 00:44:39.710 align:middle line:90%
And I mean, this is deep.

00:44:39.710 --> 00:44:40.870 align:middle line:84%
>>HARVEY: Well, it goes
deeper than that, doesn't it?

00:44:40.870 --> 00:44:41.660 align:middle line:90%
Because it goes to--

00:44:41.660 --> 00:44:42.730 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: I don't know
a woman who hasn't--

00:44:42.730 --> 00:44:44.438 align:middle line:84%
>>HARVEY: Original
sin comes through Eve.

00:44:44.438 --> 00:44:46.042 align:middle line:90%
It's a woman's body.

00:44:46.042 --> 00:44:47.250 align:middle line:90%
I mean, my god, the messages.

00:44:47.250 --> 00:44:49.166 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: But we talked
about what the fashion

00:44:49.166 --> 00:44:50.407 align:middle line:90%
industry has done to women.

00:44:50.407 --> 00:44:50.990 align:middle line:90%
>>HARVEY: Yes.

00:44:50.990 --> 00:44:52.906 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: What you called
a homosexual fantasy

00:44:52.906 --> 00:44:54.710 align:middle line:90%
of essentially a young boy.

00:44:54.710 --> 00:44:55.830 align:middle line:90%
>>HARVEY: Yes.

00:44:55.830 --> 00:44:57.360 align:middle line:90%
I'm gay myself.

00:44:57.360 --> 00:44:58.980 align:middle line:90%
But I love women.

00:44:58.980 --> 00:45:00.380 align:middle line:90%
Women are the center of my life.

00:45:00.380 --> 00:45:02.320 align:middle line:84%
And I thank god
that I was born gay

00:45:02.320 --> 00:45:04.690 align:middle line:84%
to have so many wonderful
relationships with women.

00:45:04.690 --> 00:45:07.690 align:middle line:84%
But the women I need,
and love, and celebrate

00:45:07.690 --> 00:45:10.299 align:middle line:84%
are feminine, voluptuous,
passionate women.

00:45:10.299 --> 00:45:11.465 align:middle line:90%
They're completely feminine.

00:45:11.465 --> 00:45:15.040 align:middle line:84%
They're not this
denatured feminine

00:45:15.040 --> 00:45:17.070 align:middle line:84%
with no breasts and
no hips that is now

00:45:17.070 --> 00:45:19.340 align:middle line:84%
being sold to women
as the essence.

00:45:19.340 --> 00:45:25.090 align:middle line:84%
And I think that that comes
from the destructive homosexual

00:45:25.090 --> 00:45:29.275 align:middle line:84%
designer psyche that
really, while worshipping

00:45:29.275 --> 00:45:31.870 align:middle line:84%
women, or claiming to
worship women, actually

00:45:31.870 --> 00:45:32.870 align:middle line:90%
is disgusted with women.

00:45:32.870 --> 00:45:35.020 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: But that has to
be a norm of the elite.

00:45:35.020 --> 00:45:36.670 align:middle line:90%
That is a norm of the elite--

00:45:36.670 --> 00:45:36.925 align:middle line:90%
>>HARVEY: Of course, yes.

00:45:36.925 --> 00:45:37.040 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

00:45:37.040 --> 00:45:38.748 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: --that would
create this agenda

00:45:38.748 --> 00:45:41.270 align:middle line:84%
of this self-hatred, where
you can never be thin

00:45:41.270 --> 00:45:44.360 align:middle line:84%
enough, or beautiful enough,
or good enough on some level.

00:45:44.360 --> 00:45:45.410 align:middle line:90%
And in reality, it's--

00:45:45.410 --> 00:45:46.993 align:middle line:84%
>>HARVEY: Well, it's
perfect, you see.

00:45:46.993 --> 00:45:49.325 align:middle line:84%
If you keep the great
power of the feminine that

00:45:49.325 --> 00:45:51.010 align:middle line:90%
a woman naturally has.

00:45:51.010 --> 00:45:53.230 align:middle line:84%
If you concentrate that
tremendous power, which

00:45:53.230 --> 00:45:55.146 align:middle line:84%
could become very radical
and very questioning

00:45:55.146 --> 00:45:57.900 align:middle line:84%
of what they're up, very
no-nonsense, very hitting

00:45:57.900 --> 00:45:59.640 align:middle line:84%
on the head with
a saucepan, right?

00:45:59.640 --> 00:46:02.360 align:middle line:84%
If you make them obsessed
with how thin they are,

00:46:02.360 --> 00:46:04.630 align:middle line:84%
and who they marry,
and what status they

00:46:04.630 --> 00:46:07.390 align:middle line:84%
have in the society,
then you completely,

00:46:07.390 --> 00:46:10.550 align:middle line:84%
completely destroy that
power to transform society.

00:46:10.550 --> 00:46:11.300 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes

00:46:11.300 --> 00:46:12.600 align:middle line:84%
>>HARVEY: And if you
do the same with men,

00:46:12.600 --> 00:46:14.850 align:middle line:84%
which is what of course the
corporate agenda is doing.

00:46:14.850 --> 00:46:15.180 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: It is.

00:46:15.180 --> 00:46:16.638 align:middle line:84%
>>HARVEY: If you
take the heart out

00:46:16.638 --> 00:46:19.090 align:middle line:84%
of a man, the beautiful
soul out of a man,

00:46:19.090 --> 00:46:21.450 align:middle line:84%
the passion for
compassion that a man has,

00:46:21.450 --> 00:46:23.660 align:middle line:84%
the passion to
protect the feminine,

00:46:23.660 --> 00:46:26.830 align:middle line:84%
that any man, gay or straight,
that I really love and know

00:46:26.830 --> 00:46:27.580 align:middle line:90%
has.

00:46:27.580 --> 00:46:29.860 align:middle line:84%
And if you make them
addicted to power,

00:46:29.860 --> 00:46:32.020 align:middle line:84%
and if you teach
them how to kill,

00:46:32.020 --> 00:46:34.570 align:middle line:84%
and if you glorify
killing, especially

00:46:34.570 --> 00:46:37.450 align:middle line:84%
if you can make killing
sacred, then what you've done

00:46:37.450 --> 00:46:43.410 align:middle line:84%
is totally destroy the masculine
passion to transform society.

00:46:43.410 --> 00:46:46.500 align:middle line:84%
So you're doing
it to both sexes.

00:46:46.500 --> 00:46:48.370 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: I mean,
it is so insidious--

00:46:48.370 --> 00:46:49.050 align:middle line:90%
>>HARVEY: It's horrific.

00:46:49.050 --> 00:46:50.300 align:middle line:90%
It's a new concentration camp.

00:46:50.300 --> 00:46:52.760 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: --that really don't
know very many people that

00:46:52.760 --> 00:46:55.170 align:middle line:84%
have not succumbed to
this on some level,

00:46:55.170 --> 00:46:58.760 align:middle line:84%
and live with this neuroses
and fear of the opposite sex

00:46:58.760 --> 00:47:01.060 align:middle line:84%
and rejection by
the opposite sex.

00:47:01.060 --> 00:47:03.610 align:middle line:84%
And you were saying
on-- we were off camera.

00:47:03.610 --> 00:47:05.050 align:middle line:84%
We were talking
about this and how

00:47:05.050 --> 00:47:06.712 align:middle line:84%
some of your straight
male friends--

00:47:06.712 --> 00:47:08.170 align:middle line:84%
I mean, if a woman
enters the room.

00:47:08.170 --> 00:47:08.950 align:middle line:90%
>>HARVEY: My buddies.

00:47:08.950 --> 00:47:10.000 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Your buddies.

00:47:10.000 --> 00:47:12.220 align:middle line:84%
If women enter the
room, and you have

00:47:12.220 --> 00:47:14.840 align:middle line:84%
one woman who, as you
described earlier,

00:47:14.840 --> 00:47:18.210 align:middle line:84%
is more like a young boy--
and classically in movies,

00:47:18.210 --> 00:47:21.000 align:middle line:84%
the contract says they have to
be a size zero to a size two,

00:47:21.000 --> 00:47:21.510 align:middle line:90%
for example.

00:47:21.510 --> 00:47:22.000 align:middle line:90%
>>HARVEY: Yes.

00:47:22.000 --> 00:47:24.041 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And that's being
perpetuated everywhere

00:47:24.041 --> 00:47:25.310 align:middle line:90%
in the media.

00:47:25.310 --> 00:47:27.660 align:middle line:84%
And then obesity to
counterbalance it.

00:47:27.660 --> 00:47:29.620 align:middle line:84%
But nothing really
in the middle.

00:47:29.620 --> 00:47:32.980 align:middle line:84%
You said that your male
friends would not choose.

00:47:32.980 --> 00:47:35.181 align:middle line:84%
They would choose the
voluptuous, beautiful goddess

00:47:35.181 --> 00:47:35.680 align:middle line:90%
woman.

00:47:35.680 --> 00:47:36.090 align:middle line:90%
>>HARVEY: Yes, they would.

00:47:36.090 --> 00:47:36.836 align:middle line:90%
Yes, absolutely.

00:47:36.836 --> 00:47:38.460 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: But why is
it all these women

00:47:38.460 --> 00:47:41.285 align:middle line:84%
are completely narcotized
into thinking that's not true?

00:47:41.285 --> 00:47:43.410 align:middle line:84%
I mean, inside, subconsciously,
it's a program now.

00:47:43.410 --> 00:47:45.118 align:middle line:84%
>>HARVEY: It's an
imposition, as you say,

00:47:45.118 --> 00:47:49.860 align:middle line:84%
from this frightening
agenda of denaturalization.

00:47:49.860 --> 00:47:52.860 align:middle line:84%
It's taking nature
out of nature,

00:47:52.860 --> 00:47:55.090 align:middle line:84%
bleeding the nature
out of nature.

00:47:55.090 --> 00:47:57.930 align:middle line:84%
If you can make a woman
into an anorexic boy,

00:47:57.930 --> 00:48:00.810 align:middle line:84%
and a glorious, beautiful,
powerful, passionate man

00:48:00.810 --> 00:48:05.220 align:middle line:84%
into a robot killer, then you've
got a whole race of slaves

00:48:05.220 --> 00:48:07.560 align:middle line:84%
with which you can
do anything you want.

00:48:07.560 --> 00:48:08.440 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: And we do.

00:48:08.440 --> 00:48:09.112 align:middle line:90%
>>HARVEY: Yeah.

00:48:09.112 --> 00:48:10.892 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: And we do.

00:48:10.892 --> 00:48:13.160 align:middle line:84%
>>HARVEY: But I want to say
is that although I believe

00:48:13.160 --> 00:48:16.195 align:middle line:84%
that everybody is in a certain
way afflicted by this--

00:48:16.195 --> 00:48:17.760 align:middle line:90%
I want to say two things.

00:48:17.760 --> 00:48:19.990 align:middle line:84%
I want to say that
you can transform this

00:48:19.990 --> 00:48:21.080 align:middle line:90%
through a divine healing.

00:48:21.080 --> 00:48:22.350 align:middle line:90%
It does happen.

00:48:22.350 --> 00:48:23.850 align:middle line:84%
I know that from
my own experience,

00:48:23.850 --> 00:48:27.050 align:middle line:84%
that I've been able to bring
my own masculine and feminine

00:48:27.050 --> 00:48:29.350 align:middle line:84%
into much, much greater
balance that I could ever

00:48:29.350 --> 00:48:31.110 align:middle line:84%
imagine through the
grace of the mother,

00:48:31.110 --> 00:48:33.700 align:middle line:84%
through the grace
of divine love.

00:48:33.700 --> 00:48:35.500 align:middle line:84%
And the second
thing is that I do

00:48:35.500 --> 00:48:37.970 align:middle line:84%
meet the most
astonishing younger women

00:48:37.970 --> 00:48:41.990 align:middle line:84%
and astonishing younger men
in their 30s, who are truly

00:48:41.990 --> 00:48:43.366 align:middle line:84%
breaking through
the stereotypes.

00:48:43.366 --> 00:48:44.156 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: They are.

00:48:44.156 --> 00:48:45.064 align:middle line:90%
That's the hope, yes.

00:48:45.064 --> 00:48:47.230 align:middle line:84%
>>HARVEY: And absolutely
birthing a new masculinity,

00:48:47.230 --> 00:48:50.560 align:middle line:84%
which is extremely
open to the homoerotic,

00:48:50.560 --> 00:48:55.270 align:middle line:84%
to all the things that were
banned and disgusted at before.

00:48:55.270 --> 00:48:57.930 align:middle line:84%
And women really
becoming so conscious

00:48:57.930 --> 00:49:00.220 align:middle line:84%
through the triumphs of
feminism about how they're

00:49:00.220 --> 00:49:02.140 align:middle line:84%
being manipulated,
that they truly

00:49:02.140 --> 00:49:04.590 align:middle line:84%
are coming into an acceptance
of their own masculinity,

00:49:04.590 --> 00:49:07.060 align:middle line:84%
of their own power, and
refusing to buy these images.

00:49:07.060 --> 00:49:07.893 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Very true.

00:49:07.893 --> 00:49:13.150 align:middle line:84%
>>HARVEY: So there is being born
at the moment a new masculine

00:49:13.150 --> 00:49:16.144 align:middle line:84%
and a new feminine, which
has never been seen before.

00:49:16.144 --> 00:49:18.060 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: I see this
myself in my son and it--

00:49:18.060 --> 00:49:20.351 align:middle line:84%
>>HARVEY: And I love these
guys and I love these women.

00:49:20.351 --> 00:49:21.996 align:middle line:90%
I'm in awe of who they are.

00:49:21.996 --> 00:49:23.120 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: I agree with you.

00:49:23.120 --> 00:49:25.327 align:middle line:84%
It's really us as the
middle generation.

00:49:25.327 --> 00:49:25.910 align:middle line:90%
>>HARVEY: Yes.

00:49:25.910 --> 00:49:27.660 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: The one that
gave birth to them.

00:49:27.660 --> 00:49:28.254 align:middle line:90%
>>HARVEY: Yes.

00:49:28.254 --> 00:49:29.920 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: They have
this new possibility

00:49:29.920 --> 00:49:33.020 align:middle line:84%
and we're literally in conflict,
being torn between our parents'

00:49:33.020 --> 00:49:34.430 align:middle line:90%
generation and what is.

00:49:34.430 --> 00:49:37.200 align:middle line:84%
>>HARVEY: I think that's why our
particular generation suffered

00:49:37.200 --> 00:49:38.210 align:middle line:90%
so much.

00:49:38.210 --> 00:49:40.500 align:middle line:84%
We couldn't belong
to the old world,

00:49:40.500 --> 00:49:42.430 align:middle line:84%
and we had to go
through the pain

00:49:42.430 --> 00:49:43.900 align:middle line:90%
of being midwives of the new.

00:49:43.900 --> 00:49:45.170 align:middle line:90%
But thank god we survived.

00:49:45.170 --> 00:49:48.061 align:middle line:84%
Here we are there, and they are
our friends and our beloveds.

00:49:48.061 --> 00:49:49.560 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And it's
been fascinating,

00:49:49.560 --> 00:49:51.520 align:middle line:84%
if you watch it
decade by decade--

00:49:51.520 --> 00:49:54.330 align:middle line:84%
I was having this conversation
with someone recently.

00:49:54.330 --> 00:49:56.700 align:middle line:84%
We interviewed Aaron
Russo before he died,

00:49:56.700 --> 00:49:59.170 align:middle line:84%
and he talked about
his relationship

00:49:59.170 --> 00:50:00.337 align:middle line:90%
with the Rockefeller family.

00:50:00.337 --> 00:50:01.836 align:middle line:84%
>>HARVEY: That could
be interesting.

00:50:01.836 --> 00:50:04.150 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And they
revealed an agenda to them.

00:50:04.150 --> 00:50:06.540 align:middle line:84%
And they said, you don't
think women's lib was

00:50:06.540 --> 00:50:08.640 align:middle line:90%
an organic movement, do you?

00:50:08.640 --> 00:50:10.170 align:middle line:90%
And they told him, no.

00:50:10.170 --> 00:50:14.030 align:middle line:84%
This has been
cultivated because look

00:50:14.030 --> 00:50:16.150 align:middle line:84%
what happened to
the banking system.

00:50:16.150 --> 00:50:16.815 align:middle line:90%
When you got--

00:50:16.815 --> 00:50:17.080 align:middle line:90%
>>HARVEY: Women as voters.

00:50:17.080 --> 00:50:18.621 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: --the
Federal Reserve, when

00:50:18.621 --> 00:50:21.540 align:middle line:84%
you got women in the workforce,
twice the amount of tax

00:50:21.540 --> 00:50:24.370 align:middle line:84%
revenues essentially are
bumped up considerably

00:50:24.370 --> 00:50:26.200 align:middle line:84%
by putting women
in the workforce.

00:50:26.200 --> 00:50:28.690 align:middle line:84%
Now at the same time, I
just find this whole journey

00:50:28.690 --> 00:50:31.250 align:middle line:84%
fascinating that the women
then have freedom and think,

00:50:31.250 --> 00:50:33.767 align:middle line:84%
well, I don't have to do
what this man says anymore.

00:50:33.767 --> 00:50:34.850 align:middle line:90%
I can take care of myself.

00:50:34.850 --> 00:50:35.636 align:middle line:90%
>>HARVEY: Right.

00:50:35.636 --> 00:50:37.010 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And then
the men say, I

00:50:37.010 --> 00:50:39.430 align:middle line:84%
don't have to marry you
to have sex anymore,

00:50:39.430 --> 00:50:42.170 align:middle line:90%
that we're beyond that.

00:50:42.170 --> 00:50:46.820 align:middle line:84%
The women are now in a place to
have to learn to adapt to this

00:50:46.820 --> 00:50:47.604 align:middle line:90%
new way of being .

00:50:47.604 --> 00:50:49.210 align:middle line:90%
And it was a very difficult era.

00:50:49.210 --> 00:50:52.710 align:middle line:84%
The '60s and '70s, that
whole thing of open love,

00:50:52.710 --> 00:50:54.424 align:middle line:84%
free love and sex,
was very difficult

00:50:54.424 --> 00:50:55.590 align:middle line:90%
for women for the most part.

00:50:55.590 --> 00:50:55.900 align:middle line:90%
>>HARVEY: Yeah.

00:50:55.900 --> 00:50:57.175 align:middle line:90%
And for men, I think, too.

00:50:57.175 --> 00:50:57.930 align:middle line:90%
Some men, anyway.

00:50:57.930 --> 00:50:58.721 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Some men.

00:50:58.721 --> 00:51:00.110 align:middle line:84%
And the men on
the other hand now

00:51:00.110 --> 00:51:01.790 align:middle line:84%
feel that she doesn't
need me anymore.

00:51:01.790 --> 00:51:02.660 align:middle line:90%
What's my role?

00:51:02.660 --> 00:51:03.420 align:middle line:84%
I mean, this has been
an amazing thing.

00:51:03.420 --> 00:51:05.420 align:middle line:84%
>>HARVEY: Well, the only
solution to all of this

00:51:05.420 --> 00:51:07.670 align:middle line:84%
is that the both
really cultivate

00:51:07.670 --> 00:51:09.170 align:middle line:90%
a much deeper level of love.

00:51:09.170 --> 00:51:09.980 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:51:09.980 --> 00:51:12.210 align:middle line:84%
>>HARVEY: And that men
truly understand at the most

00:51:12.210 --> 00:51:13.990 align:middle line:84%
profound level because
they're encouraged

00:51:13.990 --> 00:51:18.320 align:middle line:84%
to understand that their
nobility and their power,

00:51:18.320 --> 00:51:21.070 align:middle line:84%
that passion does not lie
in dominating and exploiting

00:51:21.070 --> 00:51:24.900 align:middle line:84%
the feminine, but in celebrating
and worshipping the feminine.

00:51:24.900 --> 00:51:27.460 align:middle line:84%
And the woman
needs to understand

00:51:27.460 --> 00:51:31.570 align:middle line:84%
that a man is something
holy and beautiful,

00:51:31.570 --> 00:51:32.987 align:middle line:90%
and needs to be also celebrated.

00:51:32.987 --> 00:51:34.070 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes, absolutely.

00:51:34.070 --> 00:51:36.560 align:middle line:90%
>>HARVEY: And also honored.

00:51:36.560 --> 00:51:39.082 align:middle line:84%
I listen to my buddies
talk about how outraged

00:51:39.082 --> 00:51:40.915 align:middle line:84%
they are about how
they're treated by women.

00:51:40.915 --> 00:51:42.620 align:middle line:84%
And of course, I
listen to my women

00:51:42.620 --> 00:51:44.770 align:middle line:84%
friends talk about
how outraged they

00:51:44.770 --> 00:51:47.110 align:middle line:84%
are that they're
treated in ways by men.

00:51:47.110 --> 00:51:49.640 align:middle line:84%
But one of the things I
noticed that women really

00:51:49.640 --> 00:51:53.240 align:middle line:84%
don't understand
about men-- and being

00:51:53.240 --> 00:51:55.780 align:middle line:84%
in this in-between position
that I find myself,

00:51:55.780 --> 00:52:01.310 align:middle line:84%
I do because I have loved men
deeply and also I am a man--

00:52:01.310 --> 00:52:04.885 align:middle line:84%
is that if you disrespect a
man, if you dishonor a man,

00:52:04.885 --> 00:52:06.480 align:middle line:90%
you drive him crazy.

00:52:06.480 --> 00:52:10.520 align:middle line:84%
Because the honor and
respect of a man for himself

00:52:10.520 --> 00:52:14.790 align:middle line:84%
is something so central to
his personality that when

00:52:14.790 --> 00:52:17.880 align:middle line:84%
the feminine, deranged
feminine, unleashes

00:52:17.880 --> 00:52:20.400 align:middle line:90%
its ferocious critique.

00:52:20.400 --> 00:52:21.940 align:middle line:84%
And when, for
example, a young man

00:52:21.940 --> 00:52:25.480 align:middle line:84%
who isn't responsible for
the 2500 years of patriarchy

00:52:25.480 --> 00:52:29.180 align:middle line:84%
is treated as a kind
of Nazi gauleiter

00:52:29.180 --> 00:52:31.350 align:middle line:84%
simply because he's blond
and has a good body.

00:52:31.350 --> 00:52:33.204 align:middle line:84%
And the woman's
projecting onto him

00:52:33.204 --> 00:52:34.620 align:middle line:84%
all of the stuff
that's she's read

00:52:34.620 --> 00:52:37.161 align:middle line:84%
in a feminist class and her own
childhood and the rest of it,

00:52:37.161 --> 00:52:40.370 align:middle line:84%
he's outraged that he should
be thought of in that way

00:52:40.370 --> 00:52:42.590 align:middle line:84%
because he doesn't experience
himself as that way,

00:52:42.590 --> 00:52:44.340 align:middle line:90%
he knows he's not that way.

00:52:44.340 --> 00:52:47.050 align:middle line:84%
And he wants to love her,
but he can't love her

00:52:47.050 --> 00:52:48.920 align:middle line:84%
if she's going to
treat him like that.

00:52:48.920 --> 00:52:50.530 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Project all
of the history onto him.

00:52:50.530 --> 00:52:51.700 align:middle line:84%
>>HARVEY: And it
works both ways.

00:52:51.700 --> 00:52:53.270 align:middle line:84%
So you have this
tragic situation

00:52:53.270 --> 00:52:57.590 align:middle line:84%
in which these very murderous
projections are preventing

00:52:57.590 --> 00:53:00.702 align:middle line:84%
the flow of love that
should be this-- that

00:53:00.702 --> 00:53:04.130 align:middle line:84%
is the foundation
of human society.

00:53:04.130 --> 00:53:05.740 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: What about yourself?

00:53:05.740 --> 00:53:09.560 align:middle line:84%
As a gay man, and you're looking
at the balance of the masculine

00:53:09.560 --> 00:53:14.880 align:middle line:84%
and the feminine, how do
you feel you are embracing

00:53:14.880 --> 00:53:18.629 align:middle line:84%
and have folded this into
the balance inside yourself?

00:53:18.629 --> 00:53:20.420 align:middle line:84%
Because you look at
that and theoretically,

00:53:20.420 --> 00:53:24.190 align:middle line:84%
you think this is the marriage
of masculine and feminine.

00:53:24.190 --> 00:53:24.840 align:middle line:90%
>>HARVEY: Yes.

00:53:24.840 --> 00:53:26.670 align:middle line:84%
Well, one of the things
that I did, and I

00:53:26.670 --> 00:53:28.253 align:middle line:84%
don't know if you
know this, is that I

00:53:28.253 --> 00:53:31.440 align:middle line:84%
had the honor when I was in my
mid-40s being asked by Harper

00:53:31.440 --> 00:53:35.020 align:middle line:84%
San Francisco to bring together
for the first time in history--

00:53:35.020 --> 00:53:38.120 align:middle line:84%
ha ha-- all of the
gay mystics of all

00:53:38.120 --> 00:53:39.410 align:middle line:90%
of the different traditions.

00:53:39.410 --> 00:53:43.516 align:middle line:84%
It was a huge excitement for
me because as a young man,

00:53:43.516 --> 00:53:44.890 align:middle line:84%
that was what I
would have wanted

00:53:44.890 --> 00:53:46.348 align:middle line:84%
if I had known that
it was possible

00:53:46.348 --> 00:53:49.230 align:middle line:84%
that many of the greatest
artists, mystics of history

00:53:49.230 --> 00:53:50.220 align:middle line:90%
have been homosexual.

00:53:50.220 --> 00:53:51.250 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:53:51.250 --> 00:53:54.430 align:middle line:84%
>>HARVEY: And in the course of
this amazing, exciting work,

00:53:54.430 --> 00:53:57.180 align:middle line:84%
I had to ask myself
the question:

00:53:57.180 --> 00:54:00.640 align:middle line:84%
why has the patriarchy
been so homophobic?

00:54:00.640 --> 00:54:03.370 align:middle line:84%
And I came up with
what I thought

00:54:03.370 --> 00:54:07.050 align:middle line:90%
really was a helpful answer.

00:54:07.050 --> 00:54:10.070 align:middle line:84%
The first answer is that what
we've been talking about.

00:54:10.070 --> 00:54:12.650 align:middle line:84%
The patriarchy, to keep
its death games going,

00:54:12.650 --> 00:54:17.180 align:middle line:84%
has to separate the male
and the female completely.

00:54:17.180 --> 00:54:22.380 align:middle line:84%
It has to make men into this
demented, totally macho image,

00:54:22.380 --> 00:54:24.680 align:middle line:84%
and women into this
passive, barefoot, pregnant,

00:54:24.680 --> 00:54:27.880 align:middle line:90%
serving image.

00:54:27.880 --> 00:54:30.850 align:middle line:84%
Because if men bleed into
the women and women bleed

00:54:30.850 --> 00:54:32.790 align:middle line:84%
into the men, then
you have people

00:54:32.790 --> 00:54:34.400 align:middle line:84%
who are sacred
androgynes, people

00:54:34.400 --> 00:54:37.550 align:middle line:84%
who are able to draw
on what they need,

00:54:37.550 --> 00:54:39.560 align:middle line:84%
what powers they need,
for the situation in hand

00:54:39.560 --> 00:54:41.110 align:middle line:90%
and can't be controlled.

00:54:41.110 --> 00:54:43.680 align:middle line:90%
So you separate to control.

00:54:43.680 --> 00:54:47.410 align:middle line:84%
Now in the old cultures, in the
ancient matriarchal cultures,

00:54:47.410 --> 00:54:49.690 align:middle line:84%
and in some of the
ancient indigenous

00:54:49.690 --> 00:54:53.190 align:middle line:84%
cultures, those people who
were born gay were not only

00:54:53.190 --> 00:54:57.900 align:middle line:84%
not disliked and
not derided, they

00:54:57.900 --> 00:55:03.240 align:middle line:84%
were considered sacred
because they, we, have

00:55:03.240 --> 00:55:07.350 align:middle line:84%
a marriage of the
masculine and the feminine

00:55:07.350 --> 00:55:08.890 align:middle line:90%
in our very nature.

00:55:08.890 --> 00:55:11.935 align:middle line:84%
You can see this in the most
evolved gay men, that they have

00:55:11.935 --> 00:55:15.610 align:middle line:84%
both the power of clarity of the
masculine with the tenderness,

00:55:15.610 --> 00:55:17.924 align:middle line:84%
and the softness, and
the emotional fluidity

00:55:17.924 --> 00:55:18.590 align:middle line:90%
of the feminine.

00:55:18.590 --> 00:55:21.770 align:middle line:84%
You can see this in
amazing lesbian women, who

00:55:21.770 --> 00:55:25.510 align:middle line:84%
have this incredible
incisive ferocity that

00:55:25.510 --> 00:55:30.450 align:middle line:84%
comes from the masculine with
this immense power of love

00:55:30.450 --> 00:55:31.480 align:middle line:90%
that they bring.

00:55:31.480 --> 00:55:34.070 align:middle line:84%
That's why so many of the
greatest writers of our time

00:55:34.070 --> 00:55:38.110 align:middle line:84%
are lesbian, the greatest
feminist theologians et cetera.

00:55:38.110 --> 00:55:42.760 align:middle line:10%
So what I think is that it's
very hopeful in our time,

00:55:42.760 --> 00:55:46.340 align:middle line:10%
is that more and more
people are recognizing

00:55:46.340 --> 00:55:48.980 align:middle line:10%
the inherent dignity
of gay people,

00:55:48.980 --> 00:55:53.092 align:middle line:10%
but also that gay people contain
a secret for straight people.

00:55:53.092 --> 00:55:55.050 align:middle line:10%
And what I'm discovering
in my own relationship

00:55:55.050 --> 00:56:00.040 align:middle line:10%
with my straight
buddies is that they,

00:56:00.040 --> 00:56:02.780 align:middle line:10%
through loving and
honoring me, are

00:56:02.780 --> 00:56:05.160 align:middle line:10%
able to incorporate
more of their feminine.

00:56:05.160 --> 00:56:08.290 align:middle line:84%
And I, through loving
and honoring them,

00:56:08.290 --> 00:56:11.120 align:middle line:84%
am able to incorporate
more of my masculine.

00:56:11.120 --> 00:56:15.000 align:middle line:84%
So there's this mystery
of profound respect,

00:56:15.000 --> 00:56:19.720 align:middle line:84%
giving birth to more balanced
people in both of us.

00:56:19.720 --> 00:56:22.220 align:middle line:84%
And it's very remarkable
because so many

00:56:22.220 --> 00:56:24.290 align:middle line:84%
of my close straight
friends say,

00:56:24.290 --> 00:56:26.500 align:middle line:84%
you know, I love you
very, very deeply,

00:56:26.500 --> 00:56:28.190 align:middle line:90%
and you've changed my life.

00:56:28.190 --> 00:56:31.255 align:middle line:84%
And you've given me permission
to be more passionate,

00:56:31.255 --> 00:56:34.320 align:middle line:90%
to be more feminine, to open.

00:56:34.320 --> 00:56:38.270 align:middle line:84%
And I say to them, I
love you because you

00:56:38.270 --> 00:56:42.550 align:middle line:84%
have shown me a
beautiful masculine that

00:56:42.550 --> 00:56:44.540 align:middle line:90%
is capable of opening.

00:56:44.540 --> 00:56:47.790 align:middle line:84%
And that has healed my
own fear of the masculine

00:56:47.790 --> 00:56:49.600 align:middle line:84%
and enabled me to
incorporate more

00:56:49.600 --> 00:56:51.110 align:middle line:90%
of my own masculine strengths.

00:56:51.110 --> 00:56:53.120 align:middle line:84%
So there is this
wonderful alchemy

00:56:53.120 --> 00:56:55.160 align:middle line:84%
that happens when
our hearts open.

00:56:55.160 --> 00:56:57.660 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Well, I had to ask
you that because whenever I sit

00:56:57.660 --> 00:56:59.690 align:middle line:84%
with you, that's what
I experience in you,

00:56:59.690 --> 00:57:02.860 align:middle line:84%
is you have very highly
developed both aspects

00:57:02.860 --> 00:57:03.370 align:middle line:90%
of very--

00:57:03.370 --> 00:57:03.650 align:middle line:84%
>>HARVEY: I've
tried very hard to.

00:57:03.650 --> 00:57:05.980 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: --highly
developed, and very present,

00:57:05.980 --> 00:57:07.520 align:middle line:90%
and forthcoming in you.

00:57:07.520 --> 00:57:09.310 align:middle line:90%
>>HARVEY: Thank you.

00:57:09.310 --> 00:57:11.665 align:middle line:84%
I really feel that, strange
enough, as I grow older.

00:57:11.665 --> 00:57:14.630 align:middle line:84%
It's the most beautiful
thing about being 60,

00:57:14.630 --> 00:57:16.764 align:middle line:84%
is that both the
masculine and the feminine

00:57:16.764 --> 00:57:18.680 align:middle line:84%
are more vibrant in me
than they've ever been.

00:57:18.680 --> 00:57:24.670 align:middle line:84%
And I can feel their dance,
more tender and more vibrantly

00:57:24.670 --> 00:57:26.885 align:middle line:84%
passionate and creative
than ever before in my life.

00:57:26.885 --> 00:57:28.510 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Whatever
it is, it's working.

00:57:28.510 --> 00:57:31.630 align:middle line:84%
And you have to keep sharing
this incredible passion you

00:57:31.630 --> 00:57:32.800 align:middle line:90%
have with the world.

00:57:32.800 --> 00:57:32.900 align:middle line:90%
>>HARVEY: Thank you, darling.

00:57:32.900 --> 00:57:33.990 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And I'm so
happy to sit with you.

00:57:33.990 --> 00:57:36.220 align:middle line:84%
And I hope you come back
and we do a series because--

00:57:36.220 --> 00:57:36.660 align:middle line:90%
>>HARVEY: I would love that

00:57:36.660 --> 00:57:39.400 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: --again, this was the
first two chapters of the book.

00:57:39.400 --> 00:57:41.890 align:middle line:84%
That's what I wanted
to emphasize here.

00:57:41.890 --> 00:57:43.487 align:middle line:90%
This is a book of the ages.

00:57:43.487 --> 00:57:44.320 align:middle line:90%
>>HARVEY: Thank you.

00:57:44.320 --> 00:57:46.380 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Of wisdom for
our times of change.

00:57:46.380 --> 00:57:47.870 align:middle line:84%
And I thank you so much
for taking the time

00:57:47.870 --> 00:57:48.680 align:middle line:90%
to be with me today.

00:57:48.680 --> 00:57:50.013 align:middle line:90%
>>HARVEY: It's my total delight.

00:57:50.013 --> 00:57:50.825 align:middle line:90%
Thank you.

00:57:50.825 --> 00:57:52.351 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: If this
has not inspired

00:57:52.351 --> 00:57:54.100 align:middle line:84%
you to find your own
true passion in life,

00:57:54.100 --> 00:57:57.568 align:middle line:84%
then you can always
watch it again.

00:57:57.568 --> 00:57:59.580 align:middle line:84%
To go much deeper
into this journey,

00:57:59.580 --> 00:58:01.460 align:middle line:84%
I highly recommend
that you pick up

00:58:01.460 --> 00:58:03.890 align:middle line:84%
a copy of Andrew's book, which
is called Radical Passion.

00:58:03.890 --> 00:58:06.290 align:middle line:84%
It features treasures
on every single page.

00:58:06.290 --> 00:58:08.350 align:middle line:84%
As mentioned earlier,
this entire conversation

00:58:08.350 --> 00:58:11.190 align:middle line:84%
was mostly based on just
the first two chapters.

00:58:11.190 --> 00:58:15.120 align:middle line:84%
Until next time, thank you for
joining us here on Gaiam TV.

00:58:15.120 --> 00:58:35.567 align:middle line:90%
