[THEME MUSIC]

00:00:19.100 --> 00:00:21.600 align:middle line:10%
>> REGINA MEREDITH: Cynthia Sue
Larson is back with us today

00:00:21.600 --> 00:00:24.560 align:middle line:10%
and we're going to expand our
conversations about The Mandela

00:00:24.560 --> 00:00:27.390 align:middle line:10%
Effect in some really
interesting ways.

00:00:27.390 --> 00:00:29.840 align:middle line:84%
I think this is
super timely as we're

00:00:29.840 --> 00:00:32.299 align:middle line:84%
becoming more and more
divided in our beliefs and way

00:00:32.299 --> 00:00:33.530 align:middle line:90%
of understanding life.

00:00:33.530 --> 00:00:37.250 align:middle line:84%
This conversation is going to
bring back some clarity, sanity,

00:00:37.250 --> 00:00:39.830 align:middle line:90%
and grace to our conversations.

00:00:39.830 --> 00:00:40.830 align:middle line:90%
Welcome back.

00:00:40.830 --> 00:00:42.870 align:middle line:10%
It's so good to see
you again, as always.

00:00:42.870 --> 00:00:43.940 align:middle line:84%
>> CYNTHIA SUE LARSON:
Love seeing you, too.

00:00:43.940 --> 00:00:45.315 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: Such
a sparkly entity.

00:00:45.315 --> 00:00:48.300 align:middle line:84%
[LAUGHTER] So what
I thought I'd do,

00:00:48.300 --> 00:00:52.440 align:middle line:84%
we have so much to talk about
in a 45 minute time frame.

00:00:52.440 --> 00:00:54.650 align:middle line:10%
So what I thought I'd
do is since we last

00:00:54.650 --> 00:00:59.250 align:middle line:10%
got together with The
Mandela Society, what--

00:00:59.250 --> 00:01:01.940 align:middle line:10%
just a couple pops
on what's happened

00:01:01.940 --> 00:01:04.510 align:middle line:10%
since then that inspired
you to write the new book

00:01:04.510 --> 00:01:06.260 align:middle line:10%
and then we'll start
getting into the rest

00:01:06.260 --> 00:01:07.790 align:middle line:10%
of the conversation.

00:01:07.790 --> 00:01:10.350 align:middle line:10%
>> LARSON: Well, this book
has been years in the making,

00:01:10.350 --> 00:01:12.060 align:middle line:10%
but I'm excited that
it's out finally,

00:01:12.060 --> 00:01:14.040 align:middle line:10%
because it's perfect timing.

00:01:14.040 --> 00:01:17.390 align:middle line:10%
The world needs to understand
what is this phenomenon

00:01:17.390 --> 00:01:21.470 align:middle line:10%
and take it seriously instead
of just thinking it's one or two

00:01:21.470 --> 00:01:25.130 align:middle line:10%
bizarre incidents that
people were confabulating

00:01:25.130 --> 00:01:28.800 align:middle line:10%
or they had collective
mistaken memories.

00:01:28.800 --> 00:01:32.485 align:middle line:84%
That's typically the
explanation for The Mandela.

00:01:32.485 --> 00:01:35.502 align:middle line:10%
But this phenomenon has
a long history behind it,

00:01:35.502 --> 00:01:36.960 align:middle line:10%
there's a lot of
science behind it.

00:01:36.960 --> 00:01:40.040 align:middle line:10%
There's a lot of language
in common from people

00:01:40.040 --> 00:01:42.620 align:middle line:10%
experiencing it behind
it, lots of authors

00:01:42.620 --> 00:01:43.740 align:middle line:10%
have written about it.

00:01:43.740 --> 00:01:45.320 align:middle line:10%
And so I wanted
to bring together

00:01:45.320 --> 00:01:50.340 align:middle line:10%
the history, the science,
the community aspects that

00:01:50.340 --> 00:01:52.440 align:middle line:10%
otherwise, if you
don't include that,

00:01:52.440 --> 00:01:55.910 align:middle line:10%
it's not really easy to see
what this entire phenomenon is

00:01:55.910 --> 00:01:57.090 align:middle line:10%
actually about.

00:01:57.090 --> 00:02:00.090 align:middle line:10%
>> REGINA: Yes, because this
is happening communally.

00:02:00.090 --> 00:02:03.260 align:middle line:10%
We have whole sects of people,
whole generations of people

00:02:03.260 --> 00:02:05.390 align:middle line:10%
with a certain
memory and are now,

00:02:05.390 --> 00:02:07.850 align:middle line:10%
I mean it's creating
cognitive dissonance, when

00:02:07.850 --> 00:02:11.130 align:middle line:10%
you say, no, never
happened, never existed,

00:02:11.130 --> 00:02:12.853 align:middle line:10%
that was never
there to begin with.

00:02:12.853 --> 00:02:14.270 align:middle line:10%
At least people
are like, what are

00:02:14.270 --> 00:02:16.700 align:middle line:10%
you talking about and
scratching their heads, that's

00:02:16.700 --> 00:02:18.000 align:middle line:10%
why your work is so important.

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:19.870 align:middle line:84%
We're going to try to
straighten this out.

00:02:19.870 --> 00:02:22.320 align:middle line:84%
So let me ask you
something because we

00:02:22.320 --> 00:02:24.120 align:middle line:90%
haven't talked about this.

00:02:24.120 --> 00:02:26.910 align:middle line:84%
Some of the most common ones
are the Berenstein Bears

00:02:26.910 --> 00:02:28.710 align:middle line:84%
that we knew when our
kids were little that

00:02:28.710 --> 00:02:31.860 align:middle line:90%
are now the Berenstain Bears.

00:02:31.860 --> 00:02:34.240 align:middle line:84%
No, it was Berenstein
Bears back then.

00:02:34.240 --> 00:02:38.460 align:middle line:84%
Also, Stouffer's stove
top stuffing everybody

00:02:38.460 --> 00:02:40.390 align:middle line:90%
had that in their pantry.

00:02:40.390 --> 00:02:43.140 align:middle line:84%
>> LARSON: Yes,
for the holidays.

00:02:43.140 --> 00:02:46.630 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: Doesn't
exist anymore.

00:02:46.630 --> 00:02:49.710 align:middle line:84%
Let's get into the
mechanics of it a bit.

00:02:49.710 --> 00:02:53.250 align:middle line:10%
So what you're saying
in The Mandela Effect

00:02:53.250 --> 00:02:58.080 align:middle line:10%
is essentially we have two
different timelines, each

00:02:58.080 --> 00:03:01.272 align:middle line:10%
with its memory thread.

00:03:01.272 --> 00:03:05.660 align:middle line:10%
To create those timelines
on these things that

00:03:05.660 --> 00:03:13.290 align:middle line:10%
seem superfluous, is it possible
there was something like the ad

00:03:13.290 --> 00:03:16.410 align:middle line:10%
agencies getting together,
debating and arguing

00:03:16.410 --> 00:03:17.390 align:middle line:10%
what should we call it?

00:03:17.390 --> 00:03:19.800 align:middle line:84%
Should we call it this or
should we call it that?

00:03:19.800 --> 00:03:27.600 align:middle line:84%
Or what is it that happened that
created two distinct identities

00:03:27.600 --> 00:03:29.895 align:middle line:90%
on parallel timelines?

00:03:29.895 --> 00:03:31.770 align:middle line:84%
>> LARSON: That's a
tough question to answer.

00:03:31.770 --> 00:03:34.350 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: I know and it's one
I've always wondered about.

00:03:34.350 --> 00:03:36.240 align:middle line:84%
And if there's any
way to even begin

00:03:36.240 --> 00:03:37.860 align:middle line:84%
approaching where
that imprint got

00:03:37.860 --> 00:03:43.505 align:middle line:84%
laid down to begin with of
Berenstein versus Berenstain.

00:03:43.505 --> 00:03:46.158 align:middle line:84%
>> LARSON: Or Stouffer's
stove top stuffing when--

00:03:46.158 --> 00:03:47.200 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Peanut butter.

00:03:47.200 --> 00:03:49.533 align:middle line:84%
>> LARSON: And now it's
apparently only been Kraft stove

00:03:49.533 --> 00:03:50.440 align:middle line:90%
top stuffing.

00:03:50.440 --> 00:03:51.240 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Exactly.

00:03:51.240 --> 00:03:53.940 align:middle line:84%
No, I look these and say, no,
that's not what it was called.

00:03:53.940 --> 00:03:54.970 align:middle line:90%
So we know better.

00:03:54.970 --> 00:03:56.053 align:middle line:90%
>> LARSON: We know better.

00:03:56.053 --> 00:04:00.360 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: And so if they say
it's only ever been Kraft today

00:04:00.360 --> 00:04:04.750 align:middle line:84%
and everyone says no, we have
all of our corporate data,

00:04:04.750 --> 00:04:07.890 align:middle line:84%
it was never
Stouffer's stove top.

00:04:07.890 --> 00:04:09.670 align:middle line:84%
>> LARSON: So many of
us, myself included,

00:04:09.670 --> 00:04:14.280 align:middle line:84%
remember quite clearly it
was Stouffer's stove top.

00:04:14.280 --> 00:04:17.170 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: Do you have any idea
with all these scientists yet?

00:04:17.170 --> 00:04:20.040 align:middle line:10%
>> LARSON: My favorite approach
on this whole thing is basically

00:04:20.040 --> 00:04:23.010 align:middle line:10%
what shows up on the cover of
my new book The Mandela Effect

00:04:23.010 --> 00:04:24.130 align:middle line:10%
and its Society.

00:04:24.130 --> 00:04:29.250 align:middle line:10%
The picture shows a hand with
these two Wigner bubbles.

00:04:29.250 --> 00:04:32.010 align:middle line:10%
I pronounce it Wigner bubbles
sometimes because it's Eugene

00:04:32.010 --> 00:04:34.120 align:middle line:10%
Wigner, but Wigner whatever.

00:04:34.120 --> 00:04:36.990 align:middle line:84%
And the idea here
is that if you look

00:04:36.990 --> 00:04:40.660 align:middle line:84%
at the initial
observation of something,

00:04:40.660 --> 00:04:42.730 align:middle line:84%
life is not quite
the way we think.

00:04:42.730 --> 00:04:47.350 align:middle line:84%
We tend to think there's one
objective reality and the truth

00:04:47.350 --> 00:04:49.890 align:middle line:84%
it's much more
accurate to say that we

00:04:49.890 --> 00:04:52.930 align:middle line:84%
have a collection of
subjective realities.

00:04:52.930 --> 00:04:54.180 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Absolutely.

00:04:54.180 --> 00:04:56.640 align:middle line:10%
But where did these two
distinct, different imprints

00:04:56.640 --> 00:04:57.670 align:middle line:10%
come from?

00:04:57.670 --> 00:04:59.950 align:middle line:10%
>> LARSON: The imprints would
come from consciousness,

00:04:59.950 --> 00:05:02.260 align:middle line:10%
and that's the true
nature of reality.

00:05:02.260 --> 00:05:04.540 align:middle line:84%
So this is not
materialism at all

00:05:04.540 --> 00:05:06.970 align:middle line:84%
and I know we've talked
about that before.

00:05:06.970 --> 00:05:09.420 align:middle line:10%
Clearly, if you start
looking at the assumption

00:05:09.420 --> 00:05:15.210 align:middle line:10%
that everything is material
classical physics instead

00:05:15.210 --> 00:05:20.760 align:middle line:10%
of actually quantum physics and
much more malleable in the sense

00:05:20.760 --> 00:05:22.980 align:middle line:10%
that there could be wave
functions that are smeared

00:05:22.980 --> 00:05:27.090 align:middle line:10%
over many different
possibilities or probabilities,

00:05:27.090 --> 00:05:29.580 align:middle line:10%
then each observer
has the opportunity

00:05:29.580 --> 00:05:34.810 align:middle line:10%
to basically affect what they're
observing and it starts there.

00:05:34.810 --> 00:05:35.610 align:middle line:10%
And then--

00:05:35.610 --> 00:05:37.540 align:middle line:10%
>> REGINA: On the most minute--

00:05:37.540 --> 00:05:38.200 align:middle line:10%
>> LARSON: --that's
the beginning.

00:05:38.200 --> 00:05:39.492 align:middle line:10%
>> REGINA: --and massive level.

00:05:39.492 --> 00:05:42.250 align:middle line:10%
>> LARSON: That's the first step
is that the observation happens.

00:05:42.250 --> 00:05:45.060 align:middle line:10%
And the placement of
the observational device

00:05:45.060 --> 00:05:48.360 align:middle line:10%
or the observer absolutely
makes a difference in

00:05:48.360 --> 00:05:51.690 align:middle line:10%
whether you see Stouffer's stove
top stuffing or the Berenstain

00:05:51.690 --> 00:05:54.700 align:middle line:10%
Bears versus the other options.

00:05:54.700 --> 00:05:59.380 align:middle line:10%
And then the second piece of
it would be a layered approach

00:05:59.380 --> 00:06:00.680 align:middle line:10%
of the observation.

00:06:00.680 --> 00:06:03.760 align:middle line:10%
So that would mean
if I'm meditating

00:06:03.760 --> 00:06:08.420 align:middle line:10%
and if I'm the person that is
self-reflective, which I am,

00:06:08.420 --> 00:06:13.220 align:middle line:10%
I'm going to be more likely
to observe these changes.

00:06:13.220 --> 00:06:15.410 align:middle line:90%
And that definitely is the case.

00:06:15.410 --> 00:06:17.830 align:middle line:84%
So people that do
more meditation

00:06:17.830 --> 00:06:22.030 align:middle line:84%
are more likely to observe all
things, including synchronicity.

00:06:22.030 --> 00:06:23.090 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: That's true

00:06:23.090 --> 00:06:26.230 align:middle line:84%
>> LARSON: The placebo effect,
all of these things that tie

00:06:26.230 --> 00:06:29.570 align:middle line:84%
in rather closely with
this Mandela Effect.

00:06:29.570 --> 00:06:32.600 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: Well, it just
makes me wonder, some thing,

00:06:32.600 --> 00:06:37.900 align:middle line:84%
some conscious unit,
human or whatever,

00:06:37.900 --> 00:06:41.860 align:middle line:84%
intervenes at some point
to change that outcome

00:06:41.860 --> 00:06:46.510 align:middle line:84%
and overwrite that
timeline it seems.

00:06:46.510 --> 00:06:48.820 align:middle line:84%
>> LARSON: Meditators are
a little bit different than

00:06:48.820 --> 00:06:52.120 align:middle line:84%
magical practitioners and that's
something I've been interested

00:06:52.120 --> 00:06:52.240 align:middle line:90%
in.

00:06:52.240 --> 00:06:53.570 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: Talk about
that a little bit.

00:06:53.570 --> 00:06:55.070 align:middle line:84%
>> LARSON: This is
very interesting.

00:06:55.070 --> 00:06:57.640 align:middle line:84%
And I've been involved
this year in an experiment

00:06:57.640 --> 00:07:00.700 align:middle line:84%
with IONS, the Institute
of Noetic Sciences.

00:07:00.700 --> 00:07:03.910 align:middle line:84%
They reached out, we're doing
a search for participants

00:07:03.910 --> 00:07:07.670 align:middle line:84%
to get involved with something
called the sigil experiment.

00:07:07.670 --> 00:07:09.980 align:middle line:10%
And they wanted
meditators and magicians,

00:07:09.980 --> 00:07:11.790 align:middle line:10%
and I'm a little bit of both.

00:07:11.790 --> 00:07:12.590 align:middle line:10%
>> REGINA: You are.

00:07:12.590 --> 00:07:14.720 align:middle line:10%
>> LARSON: Yeah, but they were
splitting us up into two groups.

00:07:14.720 --> 00:07:17.290 align:middle line:10%
And so people that can
influence reality, that would

00:07:17.290 --> 00:07:19.070 align:middle line:10%
be what they call magicians.

00:07:19.070 --> 00:07:21.820 align:middle line:10%
And the task in front
of us was to work

00:07:21.820 --> 00:07:25.360 align:middle line:10%
with a device like the
double slit experiment,

00:07:25.360 --> 00:07:28.970 align:middle line:10%
but it was an interferometer
which works physically.

00:07:28.970 --> 00:07:32.900 align:middle line:10%
It's a little box about
this big, so it's small.

00:07:32.900 --> 00:07:36.283 align:middle line:10%
>> REGINA: Explain what
an interferometer is.

00:07:36.283 --> 00:07:37.700 align:middle line:84%
>> LARSON: When I
studied physics,

00:07:37.700 --> 00:07:39.890 align:middle line:84%
I was working with
interferometers,

00:07:39.890 --> 00:07:43.370 align:middle line:84%
that would be splitting
a beam of light,

00:07:43.370 --> 00:07:45.800 align:middle line:84%
getting a photon to
interfere with itself,

00:07:45.800 --> 00:07:47.600 align:middle line:90%
usually with mirrors.

00:07:47.600 --> 00:07:50.230 align:middle line:10%
It's possible to build
the same technology

00:07:50.230 --> 00:07:53.590 align:middle line:10%
inside of a device using
electronic components

00:07:53.590 --> 00:07:56.110 align:middle line:10%
and get the same exact
an effect that you're

00:07:56.110 --> 00:08:00.380 align:middle line:10%
interfering with a photon
inside of the little sealed box.

00:08:00.380 --> 00:08:03.170 align:middle line:84%
And the unit that I got
was in a Faraday cage.

00:08:03.170 --> 00:08:04.900 align:middle line:84%
I looked at it and
it was wrapped with--

00:08:04.900 --> 00:08:05.900 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: A very
protective cage.

00:08:05.900 --> 00:08:06.490 align:middle line:84%
>> LARSON: It was
very protected.

00:08:06.490 --> 00:08:08.050 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: So what are
the implications of what

00:08:08.050 --> 00:08:08.660 align:middle line:90%
you're saying?

00:08:08.660 --> 00:08:11.470 align:middle line:84%
>> LARSON: The implications are,
it should not be possible for me

00:08:11.470 --> 00:08:15.590 align:middle line:84%
or anyone else supposedly to
influence what's inside the box,

00:08:15.590 --> 00:08:18.670 align:middle line:84%
especially if it's been
wrapped up and protected from

00:08:18.670 --> 00:08:20.500 align:middle line:90%
electromagnetic interference.

00:08:20.500 --> 00:08:24.850 align:middle line:10%
However, what I observed was I
did have very positive influence

00:08:24.850 --> 00:08:28.730 align:middle line:10%
on the box out of, I think they
collected 10 different runs.

00:08:28.730 --> 00:08:30.380 align:middle line:90%
One of them, I messed up.

00:08:30.380 --> 00:08:32.990 align:middle line:84%
I was trying to do the
energy work in advance.

00:08:32.990 --> 00:08:34.580 align:middle line:90%
I learned, don't do that.

00:08:34.580 --> 00:08:34.900 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Do it in real time.

00:08:34.900 --> 00:08:36.067 align:middle line:90%
>> LARSON: Be in the moment.

00:08:36.067 --> 00:08:37.025 align:middle line:90%
So I live and learn.

00:08:37.025 --> 00:08:38.650 align:middle line:10%
>> REGINA: So you
were able to affect--

00:08:38.650 --> 00:08:39.620 align:middle line:10%
>> LARSON: Nine times out of 10.

00:08:39.620 --> 00:08:42.130 align:middle line:10%
>> REGINA: --the outcome that
was protected in a Faraday cage.

00:08:42.130 --> 00:08:43.370 align:middle line:10%
>> LARSON: In a Faraday cage.

00:08:43.370 --> 00:08:45.140 align:middle line:10%
They didn't tell me
it was a Faraday cage,

00:08:45.140 --> 00:08:47.000 align:middle line:10%
but I'm looking
at it, obviously.

00:08:47.000 --> 00:08:48.400 align:middle line:90%
It's a Faraday cage.

00:08:48.400 --> 00:08:51.820 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: So, I mean, that gets
to everything about nonlocal

00:08:51.820 --> 00:08:53.030 align:middle line:90%
quantum reality--

00:08:53.030 --> 00:08:53.830 align:middle line:90%
>> LARSON: Exactly.

00:08:53.830 --> 00:08:56.560 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: --that doesn't
play by any rules of physics.

00:08:56.560 --> 00:09:00.220 align:middle line:84%
>> LARSON: So now I know for
sure because I get feedback

00:09:00.220 --> 00:09:01.967 align:middle line:84%
in the form of
looking at the lights.

00:09:01.967 --> 00:09:04.300 align:middle line:84%
There's a little blinking
light on the top of the device

00:09:04.300 --> 00:09:06.610 align:middle line:90%
that Dr. Dean Radin designed.

00:09:06.610 --> 00:09:10.190 align:middle line:84%
And when it goes to white
and there's a pitch of tone,

00:09:10.190 --> 00:09:12.520 align:middle line:84%
so he designed the
whole apparatus

00:09:12.520 --> 00:09:14.270 align:middle line:90%
for lots of good feedback.

00:09:14.270 --> 00:09:17.950 align:middle line:84%
So I'd hear this beautiful, high
pitched tone, which I would just

00:09:17.950 --> 00:09:19.990 align:middle line:84%
think in terms of
angels singing,

00:09:19.990 --> 00:09:22.840 align:middle line:84%
instantly, it's easy to get
it to go up to that level.

00:09:22.840 --> 00:09:26.350 align:middle line:84%
So if you're accustomed to
working with physical reality

00:09:26.350 --> 00:09:28.220 align:middle line:84%
and never mind what
you're looking at,

00:09:28.220 --> 00:09:31.770 align:middle line:84%
if you're accustomed to the
fact that we can influence this,

00:09:31.770 --> 00:09:35.880 align:middle line:84%
it's possible to do so, and we
all have access to this ability.

00:09:35.880 --> 00:09:38.860 align:middle line:10%
I would recommend, of course,
work to be a good person,

00:09:38.860 --> 00:09:41.880 align:middle line:10%
ask questions like
how good can it get?

00:09:41.880 --> 00:09:43.890 align:middle line:10%
Because when I hear
the word magic, it does

00:09:43.890 --> 00:09:45.450 align:middle line:10%
have a bad rap to it.

00:09:45.450 --> 00:09:47.650 align:middle line:10%
>> REGINA: No, we're
talking about white magic.

00:09:47.650 --> 00:09:50.310 align:middle line:10%
We're talking about
positive, joy-filled,

00:09:50.310 --> 00:09:55.380 align:middle line:10%
high frequency ability to
use the mind and the energy

00:09:55.380 --> 00:09:56.400 align:middle line:10%
to change outcomes--

00:09:56.400 --> 00:09:57.370 align:middle line:10%
>> LARSON: For the
best for all concerned

00:09:57.370 --> 00:09:58.830 align:middle line:10%
>> REGINA: --for the best.

00:09:58.830 --> 00:10:01.320 align:middle line:10%
They call it, magick, but it's
far beyond what we commonly

00:10:01.320 --> 00:10:02.410 align:middle line:10%
know as magic.

00:10:02.410 --> 00:10:03.618 align:middle line:10%
>> LARSON: I appreciate that.

00:10:03.618 --> 00:10:06.850 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: And I know you
have the ability to do that.

00:10:06.850 --> 00:10:12.630 align:middle line:84%
So we'll have to figure out who
decided to overwrite Berenstein

00:10:12.630 --> 00:10:15.240 align:middle line:90%
with Berenstain, who cares?

00:10:15.240 --> 00:10:18.630 align:middle line:84%
Someone over wrote it to
affect our collective memory

00:10:18.630 --> 00:10:20.660 align:middle line:84%
and put us into a state
of cognitive dissonance.

00:10:20.660 --> 00:10:21.910 align:middle line:90%
>> LARSON: They certainly did.

00:10:21.910 --> 00:10:25.110 align:middle line:10%
And maybe the they is us,
maybe it's time for us

00:10:25.110 --> 00:10:29.190 align:middle line:10%
collectively to start looking
at supposedly insoluble problems

00:10:29.190 --> 00:10:33.183 align:middle line:10%
and recognize that no matter
how messed up things might be--

00:10:33.183 --> 00:10:34.100 align:middle line:10%
>> REGINA: Absolutely.

00:10:34.100 --> 00:10:34.880 align:middle line:90%
>> LARSON: --we can change them.

00:10:34.880 --> 00:10:36.338 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: Yes, we
can change them.

00:10:36.338 --> 00:10:38.620 align:middle line:10%
So now let's go to more
cognitive dissonance

00:10:38.620 --> 00:10:42.700 align:middle line:10%
because I think it's important
that we point this out.

00:10:42.700 --> 00:10:46.000 align:middle line:84%
We're going to have to deal
with a lot larger issues that

00:10:46.000 --> 00:10:49.700 align:middle line:84%
are coming down the pike and
the realities as a species.

00:10:49.700 --> 00:10:53.440 align:middle line:84%
So we're starting to talk about
these things in a relaxed way

00:10:53.440 --> 00:10:58.910 align:middle line:84%
now and Mandela Effect is
a perfect way to do it.

00:10:58.910 --> 00:11:03.200 align:middle line:84%
Little town in the UK, there was
a Bolton museum and Art Gallery.

00:11:03.200 --> 00:11:06.760 align:middle line:84%
I have written down 1960s
and all these kids would come

00:11:06.760 --> 00:11:09.710 align:middle line:84%
through the museum and
they were just wowed.

00:11:09.710 --> 00:11:12.500 align:middle line:84%
They had a full scale
model of a dinosaur

00:11:12.500 --> 00:11:14.350 align:middle line:90%
and it was like the deal.

00:11:14.350 --> 00:11:16.700 align:middle line:84%
Everyone that went there
came back, oh, mom,

00:11:16.700 --> 00:11:17.780 align:middle line:90%
guess what we saw today.

00:11:17.780 --> 00:11:19.420 align:middle line:90%
So tell us the story.

00:11:19.420 --> 00:11:22.180 align:middle line:84%
>> LARSON: Well, this came to
my attention when I heard that

00:11:22.180 --> 00:11:25.690 align:middle line:84%
there were council members
in this little town of Bolton

00:11:25.690 --> 00:11:28.020 align:middle line:84%
and there was a
kerfuffle going on.

00:11:28.020 --> 00:11:28.990 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHTER]

00:11:28.990 --> 00:11:30.800 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: Yeah, this
does cause kerfuffle.

00:11:30.800 --> 00:11:34.000 align:middle line:10%
>> LARSON: There was a lot of
controversy because the council

00:11:34.000 --> 00:11:37.120 align:middle line:10%
members, I think about half of
them clearly had the memory that

00:11:37.120 --> 00:11:40.570 align:middle line:10%
you're describing where there
used to be the famous beloved

00:11:40.570 --> 00:11:41.450 align:middle line:10%
dinosaur.

00:11:41.450 --> 00:11:43.825 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: They went there on
their class trip of course,

00:11:43.825 --> 00:11:45.417 align:middle line:84%
they probably drew
drawings of it.

00:11:45.417 --> 00:11:47.250 align:middle line:84%
>> LARSON: They remembered
it quite clearly.

00:11:47.250 --> 00:11:50.240 align:middle line:84%
And so the council
members were concerned,

00:11:50.240 --> 00:11:52.130 align:middle line:84%
it's been long
enough, this dinosaur

00:11:52.130 --> 00:11:53.480 align:middle line:90%
has been apparently missing.

00:11:53.480 --> 00:11:56.510 align:middle line:84%
I don't know what's going
on, but we need an answer.

00:11:56.510 --> 00:11:58.490 align:middle line:90%
Is it out for cleaning?

00:11:58.490 --> 00:11:59.990 align:middle line:90%
Is it completed yet?

00:11:59.990 --> 00:12:01.470 align:middle line:90%
Where is our dinosaur?

00:12:01.470 --> 00:12:03.140 align:middle line:10%
And they came to
find out there never

00:12:03.140 --> 00:12:07.430 align:middle line:10%
had been a dinosaur in
their town or in the museum

00:12:07.430 --> 00:12:08.490 align:middle line:10%
officially.

00:12:08.490 --> 00:12:12.290 align:middle line:10%
And so it was interesting
because the conversation bubbled

00:12:12.290 --> 00:12:15.410 align:middle line:10%
up into the point where
the populace was surveyed

00:12:15.410 --> 00:12:18.890 align:middle line:10%
and about half the townspeople
and half the city council

00:12:18.890 --> 00:12:21.870 align:middle line:10%
were in agreement that
there used to be a dinosaur.

00:12:21.870 --> 00:12:23.100 align:middle line:10%
So it was like 50/50.

00:12:23.100 --> 00:12:25.970 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: Was it a long
the generational lines like

00:12:25.970 --> 00:12:29.270 align:middle line:84%
the older people said absolutely
it was there and the younger

00:12:29.270 --> 00:12:32.150 align:middle line:84%
people said it wasn't
because it isn't anymore?

00:12:32.150 --> 00:12:33.930 align:middle line:10%
>> LARSON: I'm not
sure about that aspect.

00:12:33.930 --> 00:12:36.263 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: Yeah, I would
expect it would be generational

00:12:36.263 --> 00:12:37.850 align:middle line:84%
because yes, we saw
it, it was there,

00:12:37.850 --> 00:12:40.200 align:middle line:84%
but the history shows
it was never there.

00:12:40.200 --> 00:12:41.450 align:middle line:10%
>> LARSON: It was never there.

00:12:41.450 --> 00:12:45.440 align:middle line:10%
>> REGINA: Now, again, this
will make a person crazy.

00:12:45.440 --> 00:12:48.430 align:middle line:84%
>> LARSON: It certainly does,
and it was such an important

00:12:48.430 --> 00:12:51.790 align:middle line:84%
feature of the museum that those
that remembered that it should

00:12:51.790 --> 00:12:54.740 align:middle line:84%
be there insisted that
we need our dinosaur.

00:12:54.740 --> 00:12:57.140 align:middle line:84%
Never mind the fact that
supposedly it didn't exist,

00:12:57.140 --> 00:12:58.940 align:middle line:84%
we know what it looked
like, bring it back.

00:12:58.940 --> 00:13:00.820 align:middle line:84%
And so we're going
to get a dinosaur.

00:13:00.820 --> 00:13:01.908 align:middle line:90%
We'll pay what it costs.

00:13:01.908 --> 00:13:04.450 align:middle line:10%
>> REGINA: Create a new one if
you have to, just get the damn

00:13:04.450 --> 00:13:05.955 align:middle line:10%
dinosaur back.

00:13:05.955 --> 00:13:07.607 align:middle line:10%
I love it.

00:13:07.607 --> 00:13:09.190 align:middle line:10%
I mean, this is an
example because one

00:13:09.190 --> 00:13:11.550 align:middle line:10%
of the people, the
town's persons,

00:13:11.550 --> 00:13:14.050 align:middle line:10%
I think one of the people that
was on the board of directors

00:13:14.050 --> 00:13:16.310 align:middle line:10%
or something said,
wait a minute,

00:13:16.310 --> 00:13:17.733 align:middle line:10%
you can't tell me
it wasn't there.

00:13:17.733 --> 00:13:19.150 align:middle line:84%
What am I supposed
to believe if I

00:13:19.150 --> 00:13:22.940 align:middle line:84%
can't believe my own memory, my
own experience, and my own eyes?

00:13:22.940 --> 00:13:26.660 align:middle line:10%
And that's taking us into
the next question, which is,

00:13:26.660 --> 00:13:31.460 align:middle line:10%
two observers can be in
the same place, seemingly

00:13:31.460 --> 00:13:34.460 align:middle line:10%
in the same circumstance,
participating

00:13:34.460 --> 00:13:38.950 align:middle line:10%
in a common reality,
but their memories

00:13:38.950 --> 00:13:41.302 align:middle line:10%
are completely separate now.

00:13:41.302 --> 00:13:44.870 align:middle line:10%
This is going outside of
The Mandela Effect a bit,

00:13:44.870 --> 00:13:46.883 align:middle line:10%
but this is part of it too.

00:13:46.883 --> 00:13:49.300 align:middle line:10%
>> LARSON: I think it's at the
heart of it because so many

00:13:49.300 --> 00:13:52.960 align:middle line:10%
people notice the Berenstain,
Bears and they'll say things

00:13:52.960 --> 00:13:55.630 align:middle line:10%
like, I'm on a different
timeline than you are,

00:13:55.630 --> 00:13:58.820 align:middle line:10%
because for me, I
remember hass avocados.

00:13:58.820 --> 00:14:01.930 align:middle line:10%
They'll remember hass
avocados used to be H-A-A-S.

00:14:01.930 --> 00:14:03.530 align:middle line:10%
>> REGINA: Yes,
what are they now?

00:14:03.530 --> 00:14:05.883 align:middle line:10%
>> LARSON: It's H-A-S-S
and it's always--

00:14:05.883 --> 00:14:07.550 align:middle line:10%
>> REGINA: Oh, no it
was always H-A-A-S.

00:14:07.550 --> 00:14:08.350 align:middle line:10%
>> LARSON: I know.

00:14:08.350 --> 00:14:10.060 align:middle line:10%
I remember that too.

00:14:10.060 --> 00:14:13.930 align:middle line:10%
So people can have different
Mandela Effect memories.

00:14:13.930 --> 00:14:16.640 align:middle line:84%
They'll acknowledge, yes,
The Mandela Effect is real,

00:14:16.640 --> 00:14:18.160 align:middle line:84%
but the one that
really gets them

00:14:18.160 --> 00:14:22.310 align:middle line:84%
is the thinker statue with
where is that fist on the face,

00:14:22.310 --> 00:14:24.170 align:middle line:84%
is it on the
forehead or the chin?

00:14:24.170 --> 00:14:25.280 align:middle line:90%
Where is that?

00:14:25.280 --> 00:14:27.350 align:middle line:84%
So there can be
differences of opinion.

00:14:27.350 --> 00:14:30.220 align:middle line:84%
I think it's interesting that
this experiment was conducted

00:14:30.220 --> 00:14:32.920 align:middle line:84%
in a collaborative
experiment conducted

00:14:32.920 --> 00:14:35.960 align:middle line:84%
between the University
of Edinburgh, Scotland,

00:14:35.960 --> 00:14:39.600 align:middle line:90%
and also in Vienna, Austria.

00:14:39.600 --> 00:14:42.800 align:middle line:10%
And what they noticed when
they ran some experiments was

00:14:42.800 --> 00:14:46.160 align:middle line:10%
that the placement of
the observational device

00:14:46.160 --> 00:14:47.400 align:middle line:10%
absolutely matters.

00:14:47.400 --> 00:14:52.110 align:middle line:84%
And it was basically working
with six entangled photons.

00:14:52.110 --> 00:14:54.110 align:middle line:10%
And so the observational
devices would

00:14:54.110 --> 00:14:56.690 align:middle line:10%
be positioned so that
the measurement would

00:14:56.690 --> 00:14:58.700 align:middle line:10%
be taken at the same
place well, roughly

00:14:58.700 --> 00:15:00.150 align:middle line:10%
the same place and same time.

00:15:00.150 --> 00:15:03.800 align:middle line:10%
It's like two observers watching
to see what's going on there.

00:15:03.800 --> 00:15:07.370 align:middle line:10%
And the Eugene Wigner
experiment originally

00:15:07.370 --> 00:15:09.230 align:middle line:10%
was predicting
that you might see

00:15:09.230 --> 00:15:13.190 align:middle line:10%
a difference, that there might
be that subjective memory.

00:15:13.190 --> 00:15:15.800 align:middle line:84%
And so that is
exactly what happened

00:15:15.800 --> 00:15:19.580 align:middle line:84%
with this joint
collaborative experiment.

00:15:19.580 --> 00:15:20.970 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Distinctly different?

00:15:20.970 --> 00:15:23.010 align:middle line:84%
>> LARSON: Distinctly
different, yes.

00:15:23.010 --> 00:15:26.000 align:middle line:84%
And so it goes along
with what we're

00:15:26.000 --> 00:15:28.910 align:middle line:84%
witnessing, where we might
talk to maybe a childhood

00:15:28.910 --> 00:15:31.100 align:middle line:84%
friend or a family
member and have

00:15:31.100 --> 00:15:35.843 align:middle line:84%
completely different memories of
what we know happened years ago.

00:15:35.843 --> 00:15:37.260 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: And be
arguing over it.

00:15:37.260 --> 00:15:39.330 align:middle line:84%
No, he didn't say that,
he wasn't even there.

00:15:39.330 --> 00:15:43.170 align:middle line:84%
We were at so-and-so's house,
that thing that families do.

00:15:43.170 --> 00:15:47.300 align:middle line:10%
And so we're going to have to
back off a little bit in our,

00:15:47.300 --> 00:15:51.320 align:middle line:10%
I think, self-certainty
about the nature

00:15:51.320 --> 00:15:53.510 align:middle line:10%
of reality and our experiences.

00:15:53.510 --> 00:15:56.510 align:middle line:10%
And I just want to bring
the holographic notion

00:15:56.510 --> 00:15:59.660 align:middle line:10%
of this in because I think
it's really important.

00:15:59.660 --> 00:16:01.210 align:middle line:84%
I used to find it
very offensive.

00:16:01.210 --> 00:16:04.280 align:middle line:10%
If you're in a holographic
reality constructed by blah,

00:16:04.280 --> 00:16:07.160 align:middle line:10%
blah, blah, well, when I
start thinking about it

00:16:07.160 --> 00:16:10.520 align:middle line:10%
and hold on a minute, this
is a holographic reality

00:16:10.520 --> 00:16:13.640 align:middle line:10%
by the sheer evidence
that there is

00:16:13.640 --> 00:16:18.010 align:middle line:10%
nothing to the atoms in our body
that construct the molecules

00:16:18.010 --> 00:16:18.810 align:middle line:10%
and cells.

00:16:18.810 --> 00:16:19.770 align:middle line:10%
There's nothing there.

00:16:19.770 --> 00:16:21.270 align:middle line:10%
It's almost all space.

00:16:21.270 --> 00:16:23.030 align:middle line:84%
Now, a lot of people
listening to this

00:16:23.030 --> 00:16:26.820 align:middle line:84%
know by now there's no
there, this isn't here.

00:16:26.820 --> 00:16:28.792 align:middle line:84%
If you're another type
of being, you literally

00:16:28.792 --> 00:16:31.250 align:middle line:84%
put your hand right through it
because there isn't anything

00:16:31.250 --> 00:16:35.090 align:middle line:84%
there except we in our
collective understanding

00:16:35.090 --> 00:16:37.170 align:middle line:84%
and belief for third
dimensional Earth life

00:16:37.170 --> 00:16:38.550 align:middle line:90%
believe this is a table.

00:16:38.550 --> 00:16:40.550 align:middle line:84%
It's dense, it's here,
and I might break my hand

00:16:40.550 --> 00:16:42.950 align:middle line:90%
if I try to hit it.

00:16:42.950 --> 00:16:44.160 align:middle line:90%
That's our understanding.

00:16:44.160 --> 00:16:48.990 align:middle line:84%
But we in all of the events
don't exist in a physical sense.

00:16:48.990 --> 00:16:52.040 align:middle line:84%
So everything's through a filter
of consciousness and everyone's

00:16:52.040 --> 00:16:53.090 align:middle line:90%
is different.

00:16:53.090 --> 00:16:53.670 align:middle line:90%
>> LARSON: That's true.

00:16:53.670 --> 00:16:54.090 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Right?

00:16:54.090 --> 00:16:56.810 align:middle line:10%
>> LARSON: Yes, and it's very
entangled at the same time that

00:16:56.810 --> 00:17:00.050 align:middle line:10%
holographic interpretation
is brilliant for showing that

00:17:00.050 --> 00:17:03.360 align:middle line:10%
there's this implicit order
that connects everything,

00:17:03.360 --> 00:17:05.990 align:middle line:10%
and then there's
the explicate order.

00:17:05.990 --> 00:17:08.420 align:middle line:10%
That was David Bohm's
wonderful interpretation

00:17:08.420 --> 00:17:09.343 align:middle line:10%
of quantum physics.

00:17:09.343 --> 00:17:11.510 align:middle line:10%
>> REGINA: Explain that to
people if they don't know

00:17:11.510 --> 00:17:13.010 align:middle line:10%
the word.

00:17:13.010 --> 00:17:15.560 align:middle line:84%
>> LARSON: Let's
start with a hologram.

00:17:15.560 --> 00:17:17.700 align:middle line:84%
Back in the '80s, if
people are that old--

00:17:17.700 --> 00:17:20.325 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: It is a 3D
rendering of a reality.

00:17:20.325 --> 00:17:22.700 align:middle line:84%
>> LARSON: I used to go to
shopping malls and holographic

00:17:22.700 --> 00:17:24.000 align:middle line:90%
images were everywhere.

00:17:24.000 --> 00:17:27.290 align:middle line:84%
It was the thing
many decades ago.

00:17:27.290 --> 00:17:30.920 align:middle line:10%
So a holographic image
basically can replicate

00:17:30.920 --> 00:17:33.360 align:middle line:10%
the entirety of a scene.

00:17:33.360 --> 00:17:36.000 align:middle line:84%
And if you take one
piece of that image,

00:17:36.000 --> 00:17:38.180 align:middle line:84%
for instance, if the
glass plate is broken

00:17:38.180 --> 00:17:41.030 align:middle line:84%
of the holographic
photograph, you'll

00:17:41.030 --> 00:17:45.020 align:middle line:84%
still have a complete image
of that scene from that one

00:17:45.020 --> 00:17:46.910 align:middle line:90%
particular perspective.

00:17:46.910 --> 00:17:49.890 align:middle line:84%
And that's what's so cool
about that holographic image.

00:17:49.890 --> 00:17:52.610 align:middle line:84%
We see it with things
like Eastern medicine

00:17:52.610 --> 00:17:54.710 align:middle line:84%
where if you look at the
ear, all of the pressure

00:17:54.710 --> 00:17:58.190 align:middle line:84%
points on the ear map to all
of the points on the body.

00:17:58.190 --> 00:18:01.220 align:middle line:84%
And it's something very
interesting to observe

00:18:01.220 --> 00:18:03.877 align:middle line:84%
in so many different
aspects of nature.

00:18:03.877 --> 00:18:05.960 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: I think so, and
I think it just gets us

00:18:05.960 --> 00:18:07.620 align:middle line:90%
comfortable with understanding.

00:18:07.620 --> 00:18:09.540 align:middle line:84%
That's the thing
that blew me away,

00:18:09.540 --> 00:18:13.570 align:middle line:84%
I think of all of the
subjects considering

00:18:13.570 --> 00:18:15.040 align:middle line:90%
the nature of reality.

00:18:15.040 --> 00:18:18.970 align:middle line:10%
The thing that I had the hardest
time getting my mind around many

00:18:18.970 --> 00:18:23.110 align:middle line:10%
years ago was that we are all
space and I've been told this

00:18:23.110 --> 00:18:26.270 align:middle line:10%
by a top physicist
back in the '80s.

00:18:26.270 --> 00:18:29.390 align:middle line:10%
He said, no, no, no, no, it's
just bosons, it's just space.

00:18:29.390 --> 00:18:31.480 align:middle line:90%
It just doesn't exist.

00:18:31.480 --> 00:18:34.300 align:middle line:84%
So your thoughts are what
will create whatever exists

00:18:34.300 --> 00:18:35.860 align:middle line:90%
in the body and so forth.

00:18:35.860 --> 00:18:38.980 align:middle line:84%
And it didn't make sense
until as years go on you start

00:18:38.980 --> 00:18:40.460 align:middle line:90%
looking at it differently.

00:18:40.460 --> 00:18:43.000 align:middle line:10%
And ultimately, our
little kids, all of us

00:18:43.000 --> 00:18:47.660 align:middle line:10%
will be looking at it as
we are a construct that

00:18:47.660 --> 00:18:51.440 align:middle line:10%
is created to have this
particular individualized

00:18:51.440 --> 00:18:53.680 align:middle line:10%
experience.

00:18:53.680 --> 00:18:55.610 align:middle line:84%
And that's a whole
separate thing

00:18:55.610 --> 00:18:59.345 align:middle line:84%
than thinking this is
it and can't be altered.

00:18:59.345 --> 00:19:01.970 align:middle line:84%
>> LARSON: And for those of us
who feel like we don't quite fit

00:19:01.970 --> 00:19:03.720 align:middle line:84%
in these little tiny
physical bodies,

00:19:03.720 --> 00:19:07.420 align:middle line:84%
it makes more sense too because
there's so much more of us than

00:19:07.420 --> 00:19:08.220 align:middle line:90%
meets the eye.

00:19:08.220 --> 00:19:08.870 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHTER]

00:19:08.870 --> 00:19:10.730 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: A lot of people leave
their bodies and try to get back

00:19:10.730 --> 00:19:12.120 align:middle line:90%
in, that's a problem.

00:19:12.120 --> 00:19:14.460 align:middle line:84%
So we're all experiencing
our own personal reality.

00:19:14.460 --> 00:19:16.850 align:middle line:84%
So let's get into a little
bit of The Mandela Effect

00:19:16.850 --> 00:19:18.800 align:middle line:84%
regarding you because
I think it's funny.

00:19:18.800 --> 00:19:23.540 align:middle line:10%
So Rupert Sheldrake, whom
we both love and adore.

00:19:23.540 --> 00:19:28.920 align:middle line:10%
Rupert at one point stated
that you are no longer alive.

00:19:28.920 --> 00:19:31.460 align:middle line:84%
What led him to
believe that and what

00:19:31.460 --> 00:19:34.910 align:middle line:84%
was the circumstance to
declare you were dead, just

00:19:34.910 --> 00:19:36.210 align:middle line:90%
like with The Mandela Effect?

00:19:36.210 --> 00:19:37.670 align:middle line:10%
>> LARSON: Well, this is
according to one particular

00:19:37.670 --> 00:19:40.700 align:middle line:10%
witness and it was somebody that
wrote to me because I put out

00:19:40.700 --> 00:19:44.582 align:middle line:10%
a call asking people, did you
notice that I had passed away,

00:19:44.582 --> 00:19:46.040 align:middle line:10%
which sounds like
a weird question.

00:19:46.040 --> 00:19:47.023 align:middle line:10%
[LAUGHTER]

00:19:47.023 --> 00:19:48.690 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: Since
you're writing to them.

00:19:48.690 --> 00:19:50.107 align:middle line:84%
>> LARSON: It
sounds very strange.

00:19:50.107 --> 00:19:51.650 align:middle line:84%
But I had been
alerted to the fact

00:19:51.650 --> 00:19:56.210 align:middle line:84%
that this might be the case
by someone who told me.

00:19:56.210 --> 00:20:00.717 align:middle line:84%
He said, you don't know me, but
in my reality, you passed away.

00:20:00.717 --> 00:20:02.300 align:middle line:84%
And I know this may
sound really weird

00:20:02.300 --> 00:20:03.660 align:middle line:90%
and don't take it the wrong way.

00:20:03.660 --> 00:20:07.865 align:middle line:10%
So he'd preface the whole thing
and I'd followed up to ask him,

00:20:07.865 --> 00:20:08.880 align:middle line:10%
when was this?

00:20:08.880 --> 00:20:09.870 align:middle line:10%
How did you find out?

00:20:09.870 --> 00:20:11.180 align:middle line:10%
What was the cause of death?

00:20:11.180 --> 00:20:13.370 align:middle line:84%
Everything he shared
with me closely

00:20:13.370 --> 00:20:16.850 align:middle line:84%
dovetailed with a time in my
life that I really almost did

00:20:16.850 --> 00:20:17.780 align:middle line:90%
die.

00:20:17.780 --> 00:20:18.790 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: 2017?

00:20:18.790 --> 00:20:19.590 align:middle line:90%
>> LARSON: Yeah.

00:20:19.590 --> 00:20:21.140 align:middle line:90%
So that's when I put--

00:20:21.140 --> 00:20:23.840 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: What happened there
and what do you think may have

00:20:23.840 --> 00:20:27.560 align:middle line:84%
happened that created then this
parallel timeline where Rupert

00:20:27.560 --> 00:20:29.760 align:middle line:90%
thought you had died?

00:20:29.760 --> 00:20:33.200 align:middle line:84%
>> LARSON: I haven't reached out
to Rupert because that report is

00:20:33.200 --> 00:20:36.980 align:middle line:84%
from a particular person who
remembers that she saw that he

00:20:36.980 --> 00:20:38.480 align:middle line:90%
did say that.

00:20:38.480 --> 00:20:41.100 align:middle line:84%
So probably, there's no
trace of that reality.

00:20:41.100 --> 00:20:42.200 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Probably no.

00:20:42.200 --> 00:20:44.090 align:middle line:84%
>> LARSON: I didn't
die in this reality.

00:20:44.090 --> 00:20:46.940 align:middle line:84%
So he'd wonder, what
are you talking about?

00:20:46.940 --> 00:20:48.750 align:middle line:10%
But what happened
in my life is I'd

00:20:48.750 --> 00:20:51.880 align:middle line:10%
gone through a series of
emotional shocks to my system,

00:20:51.880 --> 00:20:54.450 align:middle line:10%
and things had happened
in the physical world that

00:20:54.450 --> 00:20:57.120 align:middle line:10%
rattled me deeply,
including feelings

00:20:57.120 --> 00:21:00.160 align:middle line:10%
of betrayal with someone
that I thought I trusted.

00:21:00.160 --> 00:21:02.580 align:middle line:10%
And so it just shook
me to the core.

00:21:02.580 --> 00:21:05.970 align:middle line:10%
I did bounce back eventually,
and I realized, wait a minute,

00:21:05.970 --> 00:21:09.390 align:middle line:10%
draw a deep and strong into
the core of my fiber of being

00:21:09.390 --> 00:21:11.320 align:middle line:10%
and never mind what
people are doing.

00:21:11.320 --> 00:21:15.010 align:middle line:84%
And people might do things like
that, but I'll rise up anyway.

00:21:15.010 --> 00:21:17.290 align:middle line:84%
So I'd been through
that on the inside.

00:21:17.290 --> 00:21:18.660 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: Was it making
you sick on the outside?

00:21:18.660 --> 00:21:19.785 align:middle line:90%
>> LARSON: It made me sick.

00:21:19.785 --> 00:21:21.240 align:middle line:90%
I got pneumonia.

00:21:21.240 --> 00:21:22.960 align:middle line:90%
It affected my lungs.

00:21:22.960 --> 00:21:27.400 align:middle line:84%
And so it was pretty bad
that winter of 2016, 2017.

00:21:27.400 --> 00:21:30.953 align:middle line:84%
So when I heard about this,
that was spot on the money.

00:21:30.953 --> 00:21:32.370 align:middle line:84%
And then when lots
of other people

00:21:32.370 --> 00:21:34.660 align:middle line:84%
said, yes, we also
remember you died,

00:21:34.660 --> 00:21:37.870 align:middle line:84%
then it shows that
these reports,

00:21:37.870 --> 00:21:40.980 align:middle line:84%
it's like that other timeline
where I did pass away.

00:21:40.980 --> 00:21:44.070 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: So in one timeline
you passed away and those people

00:21:44.070 --> 00:21:46.090 align:middle line:84%
were on that timeline
remembered it.

00:21:46.090 --> 00:21:48.090 align:middle line:10%
And now they're seeing
you here on this timeline

00:21:48.090 --> 00:21:49.360 align:middle line:10%
where you didn't pass away.

00:21:49.360 --> 00:21:56.020 align:middle line:90%


00:21:56.020 --> 00:21:57.810 align:middle line:84%
How do most people
respond to this?

00:21:57.810 --> 00:22:00.420 align:middle line:84%
>> LARSON: Well, most people
would think it's pretty weird,

00:22:00.420 --> 00:22:01.420 align:middle line:90%
I mean, let's be honest.

00:22:01.420 --> 00:22:03.997 align:middle line:84%
[LAUGHTER] Now, if
they watch your show,

00:22:03.997 --> 00:22:05.080 align:middle line:90%
it's a different audience.

00:22:05.080 --> 00:22:06.090 align:middle line:10%
>> REGINA: Yes, of course.

00:22:06.090 --> 00:22:08.507 align:middle line:10%
>> LARSON: So people that watch
your show would think, OK,

00:22:08.507 --> 00:22:10.430 align:middle line:10%
that's interesting I hope.

00:22:10.430 --> 00:22:12.440 align:middle line:10%
The Mandela Effect
itself, of course, it's

00:22:12.440 --> 00:22:15.980 align:middle line:10%
named after Nelson
Mandela, some people

00:22:15.980 --> 00:22:18.320 align:middle line:10%
remember he passed away
while he was incarcerated

00:22:18.320 --> 00:22:22.610 align:middle line:10%
on Robin's island
around 1987, but now

00:22:22.610 --> 00:22:23.670 align:middle line:10%
that's not what happened.

00:22:23.670 --> 00:22:27.720 align:middle line:84%
So it dovetails in with
that fits the same pattern.

00:22:27.720 --> 00:22:33.140 align:middle line:84%
And also, Mark Twain famously
was reported back in 1897

00:22:33.140 --> 00:22:34.230 align:middle line:90%
that he had died.

00:22:34.230 --> 00:22:37.420 align:middle line:84%
I suspect that was an early
case of The Mandela Effect,

00:22:37.420 --> 00:22:38.560 align:middle line:90%
it's quite possible.

00:22:38.560 --> 00:22:41.210 align:middle line:10%
>> REGINA: So is there a part
of you that understands what

00:22:41.210 --> 00:22:44.230 align:middle line:10%
happened at that time and is
maybe a part of you that did

00:22:44.230 --> 00:22:45.030 align:middle line:10%
die?

00:22:45.030 --> 00:22:46.150 align:middle line:10%
>> LARSON: I think
it's quite possible.

00:22:46.150 --> 00:22:48.470 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: And so that timeline
did continue for an aspect

00:22:48.470 --> 00:22:49.270 align:middle line:90%
of you.

00:22:49.270 --> 00:22:51.540 align:middle line:84%
>> LARSON: So the part of
me that's the tough scrapper

00:22:51.540 --> 00:22:54.210 align:middle line:84%
who's like, OK, so I got
betrayed by someone I loved

00:22:54.210 --> 00:22:57.057 align:middle line:84%
and trusted and they did
something that's unconscionable,

00:22:57.057 --> 00:22:58.390 align:middle line:90%
it doesn't make any sense to me.

00:22:58.390 --> 00:22:59.860 align:middle line:84%
But you know what,
that can happen.

00:22:59.860 --> 00:23:01.140 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: That's the one
that's here sitting with me.

00:23:01.140 --> 00:23:03.040 align:middle line:84%
>> LARSON: I'm right here
and I bounce back, I'm here.

00:23:03.040 --> 00:23:05.790 align:middle line:10%
>> REGINA: The one that was hurt
and had pneumonia apparently

00:23:05.790 --> 00:23:06.880 align:middle line:10%
went the other direction.

00:23:06.880 --> 00:23:09.050 align:middle line:10%
>> LARSON: Yeah, I think
they just got to her.

00:23:09.050 --> 00:23:12.450 align:middle line:10%
So in that case, it was
too much and it did me in.

00:23:12.450 --> 00:23:16.140 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: Let's start talking
about it from our ability

00:23:16.140 --> 00:23:20.460 align:middle line:84%
to affect reality in this sense,
from a really positive point

00:23:20.460 --> 00:23:22.950 align:middle line:84%
of view, because this is
something that you wrote down

00:23:22.950 --> 00:23:26.590 align:middle line:90%
that I loved talking about this.

00:23:26.590 --> 00:23:28.950 align:middle line:10%
And that is that
the world at large

00:23:28.950 --> 00:23:31.620 align:middle line:10%
is experiencing these
miraculous changes

00:23:31.620 --> 00:23:33.930 align:middle line:10%
and that we wouldn't
have expected or seen

00:23:33.930 --> 00:23:35.020 align:middle line:10%
a couple of decades ago.

00:23:35.020 --> 00:23:38.180 align:middle line:84%
And you say it has to do with
the healing of the ozone layer.

00:23:38.180 --> 00:23:39.880 align:middle line:84%
Part of it is
catalytic converters,

00:23:39.880 --> 00:23:44.230 align:middle line:84%
but beyond that, even the
radiation dissipating in Japan.

00:23:44.230 --> 00:23:48.010 align:middle line:84%
Remember that that's going
to be a toxic dumping ground

00:23:48.010 --> 00:23:49.530 align:middle line:84%
anyone that
approaches, it's going

00:23:49.530 --> 00:23:51.580 align:middle line:90%
to have cancer and all that.

00:23:51.580 --> 00:23:55.870 align:middle line:84%
And then microbes, they eat
plastic and toxic waste.

00:23:55.870 --> 00:24:00.300 align:middle line:84%
And we have a ton of healing
happening on this planet

00:24:00.300 --> 00:24:04.140 align:middle line:84%
because she's living her
own multiple timelines

00:24:04.140 --> 00:24:07.830 align:middle line:84%
and she has her own choice of
which way she's going to go.

00:24:07.830 --> 00:24:09.108 align:middle line:90%
So let's talk about that.

00:24:09.108 --> 00:24:11.400 align:middle line:84%
>> LARSON: She's a patient
mother with us, I would say,

00:24:11.400 --> 00:24:14.970 align:middle line:84%
very patient for us to come up
a learning curve and get over

00:24:14.970 --> 00:24:17.710 align:middle line:84%
ourselves and recognize
that we can pull together.

00:24:17.710 --> 00:24:20.520 align:middle line:84%
And like you said, these
things that seem insoluble

00:24:20.520 --> 00:24:24.600 align:middle line:84%
can definitely come full circle
into an amazing, miraculous

00:24:24.600 --> 00:24:25.740 align:middle line:90%
recovery.

00:24:25.740 --> 00:24:26.800 align:middle line:90%
We can do that.

00:24:26.800 --> 00:24:29.430 align:middle line:10%
And this ties in with some
of the Indigenous people

00:24:29.430 --> 00:24:33.600 align:middle line:10%
that were waiting for Western
civilization and all of mankind

00:24:33.600 --> 00:24:35.170 align:middle line:10%
to step up the game.

00:24:35.170 --> 00:24:35.970 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Exactly.

00:24:35.970 --> 00:24:38.140 align:middle line:84%
>> LARSON: You guys can
dream this new world now.

00:24:38.140 --> 00:24:41.130 align:middle line:84%
And so it's up to us to
start asking how good can it

00:24:41.130 --> 00:24:44.260 align:middle line:84%
get to start really
resonating with the fact,

00:24:44.260 --> 00:24:46.720 align:middle line:84%
like you pointed out, things
can be quite different,

00:24:46.720 --> 00:24:48.360 align:middle line:90%
and that's OK.

00:24:48.360 --> 00:24:51.090 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: And can you imagine
how Mother Earth must have felt

00:24:51.090 --> 00:24:53.220 align:middle line:90%
when industrialization started?

00:24:53.220 --> 00:24:55.990 align:middle line:84%
All this toxic sludge
going into her rivers,

00:24:55.990 --> 00:25:00.220 align:middle line:84%
it's like, hey, how long before
they're going to wake up?

00:25:00.220 --> 00:25:02.340 align:middle line:84%
Because the Indigenous
populations never

00:25:02.340 --> 00:25:04.470 align:middle line:84%
forgot the connection
to the Earth

00:25:04.470 --> 00:25:06.280 align:middle line:90%
and to do no harm to the Earth.

00:25:06.280 --> 00:25:10.940 align:middle line:84%
They maintain that to a large
extent throughout the world.

00:25:10.940 --> 00:25:12.870 align:middle line:84%
And so we're the
primitive people

00:25:12.870 --> 00:25:14.550 align:middle line:84%
having to catch up
after having done

00:25:14.550 --> 00:25:17.890 align:middle line:84%
so thoughtlessly trashed
this beautiful planet

00:25:17.890 --> 00:25:19.450 align:middle line:90%
and that can be reversed.

00:25:19.450 --> 00:25:22.230 align:middle line:90%
She's very effective at healing.

00:25:22.230 --> 00:25:23.160 align:middle line:90%
>> LARSON: Absolutely.

00:25:23.160 --> 00:25:24.930 align:middle line:84%
And it's an interesting
time because when

00:25:24.930 --> 00:25:27.390 align:middle line:84%
we look at this fourth
world going into the fifth,

00:25:27.390 --> 00:25:29.140 align:middle line:84%
speaking about
Indigenous wisdom,

00:25:29.140 --> 00:25:31.770 align:middle line:84%
I like to look at the chakras
and that fourth chakra is

00:25:31.770 --> 00:25:34.600 align:middle line:84%
the heart, which we've now
mastered it, hopefully.

00:25:34.600 --> 00:25:37.830 align:middle line:10%
So we're good at activity,
doing things, making a mark

00:25:37.830 --> 00:25:40.080 align:middle line:10%
in the world, but we're
moving into the throat

00:25:40.080 --> 00:25:42.630 align:middle line:10%
chakra and that
fifth world, that's

00:25:42.630 --> 00:25:48.010 align:middle line:10%
all about knowing who we are and
being certain of that deeply.

00:25:48.010 --> 00:25:50.030 align:middle line:10%
And that awareness is important.

00:25:50.030 --> 00:25:52.030 align:middle line:10%
And the opposite of that
would be the confusion.

00:25:52.030 --> 00:25:54.100 align:middle line:10%
So that's the conflict
we're heading into.

00:25:54.100 --> 00:25:55.860 align:middle line:90%
How do we know who we are?

00:25:55.860 --> 00:25:57.370 align:middle line:90%
How do we claim that?

00:25:57.370 --> 00:26:00.330 align:middle line:84%
And this is where it
matters to be a good person

00:26:00.330 --> 00:26:03.930 align:middle line:84%
and to draw forth from
that deep Indigenous wisdom

00:26:03.930 --> 00:26:05.710 align:middle line:90%
that we all have access to.

00:26:05.710 --> 00:26:09.262 align:middle line:84%
It's not something that
only primitive people have.

00:26:09.262 --> 00:26:11.220 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: No, not at
all, we've all been that.

00:26:11.220 --> 00:26:12.810 align:middle line:90%
We've all been all things.

00:26:12.810 --> 00:26:15.690 align:middle line:84%
So of course, we have
that still in us.

00:26:15.690 --> 00:26:18.360 align:middle line:84%
Just as many in
Indigenous tribes

00:26:18.360 --> 00:26:21.430 align:middle line:84%
have also expanded over
to the Western world

00:26:21.430 --> 00:26:23.068 align:middle line:84%
at web point in their
incarnation paths

00:26:23.068 --> 00:26:24.610 align:middle line:84%
and have come back
to where they are.

00:26:24.610 --> 00:26:28.560 align:middle line:84%
We all have all of that
in the field in us.

00:26:28.560 --> 00:26:31.380 align:middle line:10%
Better not to classify it
like I just did, I suppose.

00:26:31.380 --> 00:26:32.180 align:middle line:10%
>> LARSON: It's OK.

00:26:32.180 --> 00:26:33.910 align:middle line:10%
[LAUGHTER]

00:26:33.910 --> 00:26:36.675 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: But I know everybody
understood what we were saying.

00:26:36.675 --> 00:26:40.050 align:middle line:84%
So one of the things that I
also have found intriguing

00:26:40.050 --> 00:26:44.260 align:middle line:84%
and this came up maybe 10, I
don't know, 8 to 10 years ago,

00:26:44.260 --> 00:26:48.300 align:middle line:84%
there was a classified project
reportedly called Project

00:26:48.300 --> 00:26:50.230 align:middle line:90%
Looking Glass.

00:26:50.230 --> 00:26:54.880 align:middle line:84%
And in that they use
supercomputer models,

00:26:54.880 --> 00:27:01.840 align:middle line:84%
taking all of the algorithms for
the behavior choices, history

00:27:01.840 --> 00:27:06.230 align:middle line:84%
of humankind to model what was
going to happen in the future,

00:27:06.230 --> 00:27:08.590 align:middle line:84%
probably to find out how
controllable we would be

00:27:08.590 --> 00:27:09.800 align:middle line:90%
or something, who knows?

00:27:09.800 --> 00:27:12.980 align:middle line:84%
I don't know who paid
for it, I'm guessing.

00:27:12.980 --> 00:27:14.123 align:middle line:90%
Do you remember this?

00:27:14.123 --> 00:27:16.040 align:middle line:84%
>> LARSON: I've heard
of two different things.

00:27:16.040 --> 00:27:17.440 align:middle line:84%
There were the computer
models and I've

00:27:17.440 --> 00:27:19.225 align:middle line:84%
heard of Project
Looking Glass, and they

00:27:19.225 --> 00:27:21.350 align:middle line:84%
may be two different things,
maybe they're related,

00:27:21.350 --> 00:27:22.485 align:middle line:90%
but I've definitely.

00:27:22.485 --> 00:27:23.360 align:middle line:90%
And I touch on this--

00:27:23.360 --> 00:27:24.943 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: They have
the same outcome.

00:27:24.943 --> 00:27:25.970 align:middle line:90%
And this is important.

00:27:25.970 --> 00:27:28.532 align:middle line:84%
So please tell us
about this because I

00:27:28.532 --> 00:27:31.090 align:middle line:84%
think this is really
important and it's not

00:27:31.090 --> 00:27:32.630 align:middle line:90%
talked about that much anymore.

00:27:32.630 --> 00:27:34.730 align:middle line:10%
>> LARSON: This should
be a big topic, I agree.

00:27:34.730 --> 00:27:36.920 align:middle line:10%
And I do cover this
also in the book.

00:27:36.920 --> 00:27:38.920 align:middle line:10%
What happens is when
they look forward

00:27:38.920 --> 00:27:42.520 align:middle line:10%
to see where are things going,
because the models were supposed

00:27:42.520 --> 00:27:46.540 align:middle line:10%
to be guideposts so that the
leaders of the free world

00:27:46.540 --> 00:27:50.600 align:middle line:10%
and the powers that be can
make good decisions with quotes

00:27:50.600 --> 00:27:53.190 align:middle line:10%
around it for
everybody concerned,

00:27:53.190 --> 00:27:54.810 align:middle line:10%
hopefully for our
best interests.

00:27:54.810 --> 00:27:56.640 align:middle line:10%
That was supposedly
what's going on.

00:27:56.640 --> 00:27:58.670 align:middle line:10%
But it was concerning
to those powers

00:27:58.670 --> 00:28:01.500 align:middle line:10%
that be who were looking into
that Project Looking Glass,

00:28:01.500 --> 00:28:07.650 align:middle line:10%
because what they saw was past a
point in time around 2012 or so.

00:28:07.650 --> 00:28:09.920 align:middle line:84%
They could no longer
see with certainty

00:28:09.920 --> 00:28:11.950 align:middle line:90%
where things were going.

00:28:11.950 --> 00:28:15.350 align:middle line:84%
It was too chaotic,
the possible timelines.

00:28:15.350 --> 00:28:18.900 align:middle line:10%
It was just a big,
big spaghetti mess,

00:28:18.900 --> 00:28:21.860 align:middle line:10%
like things going in all
directions, not just one

00:28:21.860 --> 00:28:24.980 align:middle line:10%
clear timeline, but
too much disarray

00:28:24.980 --> 00:28:26.890 align:middle line:10%
to be able to read
it properly at all.

00:28:26.890 --> 00:28:28.640 align:middle line:10%
I think there's something
interesting here

00:28:28.640 --> 00:28:31.880 align:middle line:10%
because it shows that there's
no clear way for the powers that

00:28:31.880 --> 00:28:35.150 align:middle line:10%
be to continue
holding that a grip

00:28:35.150 --> 00:28:40.640 align:middle line:10%
or restraint and that
overarching power model that

00:28:40.640 --> 00:28:43.170 align:middle line:10%
was being utilized
that's breaking down.

00:28:43.170 --> 00:28:44.870 align:middle line:10%
So what they were
really looking at

00:28:44.870 --> 00:28:49.370 align:middle line:10%
and they knew it was that the
entire premise of the power

00:28:49.370 --> 00:28:52.713 align:middle line:10%
structures that have been
fall apart in the time period

00:28:52.713 --> 00:28:55.130 align:middle line:10%
that we're living through right
now because we're 12 years

00:28:55.130 --> 00:28:56.670 align:middle line:10%
after 2012.

00:28:56.670 --> 00:29:01.190 align:middle line:10%
And this has been epic as
far as what's going on so far

00:29:01.190 --> 00:29:02.600 align:middle line:10%
and where it's headed.

00:29:02.600 --> 00:29:04.920 align:middle line:10%
>> REGINA: Yes, and I
think the computer model,

00:29:04.920 --> 00:29:07.230 align:middle line:10%
whether it was part of
that or not part of that,

00:29:07.230 --> 00:29:11.240 align:middle line:10%
the supercomputer modeling that
this person back when Kerry

00:29:11.240 --> 00:29:14.290 align:middle line:10%
Cassidy interviewed
him years ago said,

00:29:14.290 --> 00:29:17.470 align:middle line:10%
what it all ends at is
that there is an awakening

00:29:17.470 --> 00:29:21.400 align:middle line:10%
of consciousness on the planet,
meaning just what you said.

00:29:21.400 --> 00:29:23.453 align:middle line:10%
>> LARSON: Exactly.

00:29:23.453 --> 00:29:25.870 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: Those controllers,
they're not going to be able

00:29:25.870 --> 00:29:28.480 align:middle line:84%
to maintain the game any longer,
we're already starting to see

00:29:28.480 --> 00:29:29.320 align:middle line:90%
that.

00:29:29.320 --> 00:29:31.560 align:middle line:84%
I mean, really everything's
in perfect order.

00:29:31.560 --> 00:29:32.360 align:middle line:90%
>> LARSON: It is.

00:29:32.360 --> 00:29:34.760 align:middle line:84%
And I think part of this
is The Mandela Effect

00:29:34.760 --> 00:29:37.690 align:middle line:84%
again with that awareness
that subjective reality is

00:29:37.690 --> 00:29:39.430 align:middle line:90%
the key to this.

00:29:39.430 --> 00:29:41.350 align:middle line:84%
It's becoming
comfortable with the fact

00:29:41.350 --> 00:29:44.150 align:middle line:84%
that reality can look one
way, but we can change it,

00:29:44.150 --> 00:29:45.170 align:middle line:90%
it can be different.

00:29:45.170 --> 00:29:46.600 align:middle line:84%
We can have different
memories, we

00:29:46.600 --> 00:29:48.290 align:middle line:90%
don't need to argue about that.

00:29:48.290 --> 00:29:50.740 align:middle line:10%
And so this is not
solipsism, which

00:29:50.740 --> 00:29:53.740 align:middle line:10%
is where I would be the
center of the reality

00:29:53.740 --> 00:29:57.290 align:middle line:10%
because my subjective
view is right, no.

00:29:57.290 --> 00:29:59.260 align:middle line:84%
It's more like
copernicanism, and that's

00:29:59.260 --> 00:30:04.060 align:middle line:84%
a term we'll credit a physicist,
Eric Cavalcanti, who came up

00:30:04.060 --> 00:30:09.320 align:middle line:84%
with the term Wigner bubble and
also this idea of copernicanism.

00:30:09.320 --> 00:30:10.930 align:middle line:10%
And I think that's
the way forward

00:30:10.930 --> 00:30:14.160 align:middle line:10%
to recognize that collectively
we'll work together.

00:30:14.160 --> 00:30:15.660 align:middle line:10%
We might have
different histories,

00:30:15.660 --> 00:30:17.160 align:middle line:10%
we might have
different memories,

00:30:17.160 --> 00:30:21.290 align:middle line:10%
but we don't need to engage in
animosity toward one another

00:30:21.290 --> 00:30:22.530 align:middle line:10%
or ourselves.

00:30:22.530 --> 00:30:25.940 align:middle line:84%
And this is that enlightenment,
that age of awakening

00:30:25.940 --> 00:30:29.430 align:middle line:84%
and it's a recalibration of
where is the power center.

00:30:29.430 --> 00:30:32.507 align:middle line:84%
If it's decentralized, then
what does that look like?

00:30:32.507 --> 00:30:34.090 align:middle line:84%
And that'll be up
to us to figure out.

00:30:34.090 --> 00:30:36.890 align:middle line:90%


00:30:36.890 --> 00:30:39.590 align:middle line:10%
>> REGINA: Well, it was
a little while back,

00:30:39.590 --> 00:30:43.620 align:middle line:10%
Lee Harris and I recorded a
book called the Future Human.

00:30:43.620 --> 00:30:48.050 align:middle line:84%
And in it they
discussed what was

00:30:48.050 --> 00:30:52.400 align:middle line:84%
going to happen with those who
have been attempting to control

00:30:52.400 --> 00:30:53.850 align:middle line:90%
for tens of thousands of years.

00:30:53.850 --> 00:30:56.870 align:middle line:10%
And interestingly,
every channeler

00:30:56.870 --> 00:31:00.440 align:middle line:10%
that I speak to now, the
ones I respect and the ones

00:31:00.440 --> 00:31:04.760 align:middle line:10%
I have on my show, their beings
are all now more comfortable

00:31:04.760 --> 00:31:08.310 align:middle line:10%
starting to say, yes, this
game has been controlled,

00:31:08.310 --> 00:31:09.480 align:middle line:10%
but that's over.

00:31:09.480 --> 00:31:12.170 align:middle line:10%
And I think part of it is
because our minds are so strong

00:31:12.170 --> 00:31:14.100 align:middle line:10%
and our fear nature
is so strong.

00:31:14.100 --> 00:31:16.430 align:middle line:10%
They didn't want
to talk about that

00:31:16.430 --> 00:31:20.690 align:middle line:10%
and essentially
deepen those anxieties

00:31:20.690 --> 00:31:24.480 align:middle line:10%
and fears by even talking
about it for the longest time.

00:31:24.480 --> 00:31:29.190 align:middle line:84%
And now that the game is all
but over, they're saying,

00:31:29.190 --> 00:31:32.940 align:middle line:84%
yes, you have been up against
this, but it can't continue now

00:31:32.940 --> 00:31:34.710 align:middle line:90%
and all of them are saying it.

00:31:34.710 --> 00:31:38.870 align:middle line:10%
And furthermore, the Z's, Lee
Harris's group of channel beings

00:31:38.870 --> 00:31:42.920 align:middle line:10%
said, the frequencies that are
running through your cosmos

00:31:42.920 --> 00:31:44.770 align:middle line:10%
are refined.

00:31:44.770 --> 00:31:47.150 align:middle line:10%
It's a higher level of
frequency and there's

00:31:47.150 --> 00:31:51.260 align:middle line:10%
nothing that can sustain its
life within it without rising

00:31:51.260 --> 00:31:53.150 align:middle line:10%
to match that
frequency, including

00:31:53.150 --> 00:31:57.480 align:middle line:10%
some of the beings that are
projecting this onto all of us.

00:31:57.480 --> 00:32:00.680 align:middle line:10%
They said even they are going to
go through a process of change,

00:32:00.680 --> 00:32:02.690 align:middle line:10%
not just breaking down
of systems and then

00:32:02.690 --> 00:32:05.280 align:middle line:10%
restructuring and
transforming them,

00:32:05.280 --> 00:32:07.410 align:middle line:10%
but the beings themselves
that are participating

00:32:07.410 --> 00:32:09.410 align:middle line:10%
will have no choice but
to go through the change

00:32:09.410 --> 00:32:10.290 align:middle line:10%
or go elsewhere.

00:32:10.290 --> 00:32:11.345 align:middle line:90%
>> LARSON: Absolutely.

00:32:11.345 --> 00:32:14.900 align:middle line:84%
I've seen that just
on things that I've--

00:32:14.900 --> 00:32:18.440 align:middle line:84%
I don't write about it yet, but
I've absolutely seen that too.

00:32:18.440 --> 00:32:20.300 align:middle line:10%
What I'm thinking
about is an experience

00:32:20.300 --> 00:32:22.920 align:middle line:10%
I had at our first
Mandela Effect conference.

00:32:22.920 --> 00:32:26.720 align:middle line:84%
It was just at breakfast one
morning and one of the attendees

00:32:26.720 --> 00:32:29.960 align:middle line:84%
was talking about the
reptilians and the fact

00:32:29.960 --> 00:32:32.120 align:middle line:84%
that they'd
apparently not really

00:32:32.120 --> 00:32:34.310 align:middle line:84%
had much contact
with source, and he

00:32:34.310 --> 00:32:36.110 align:middle line:90%
was feeling sorry about that.

00:32:36.110 --> 00:32:39.840 align:middle line:10%
So we were doing some energy
work and connecting with them,

00:32:39.840 --> 00:32:42.350 align:middle line:10%
but subsequent to
that, apparently

00:32:42.350 --> 00:32:45.362 align:middle line:10%
things radically changed.

00:32:45.362 --> 00:32:47.070 align:middle line:10%
What we were looking
at is just a change,

00:32:47.070 --> 00:32:49.070 align:middle line:10%
as you're saying,
with some of those

00:32:49.070 --> 00:32:51.170 align:middle line:10%
what you might call egregores.

00:32:51.170 --> 00:32:52.880 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Yes, egregores.

00:32:52.880 --> 00:32:57.110 align:middle line:84%
Those who still
need to have control

00:32:57.110 --> 00:33:00.770 align:middle line:84%
and maybe a little juice from
a human emotions and such

00:33:00.770 --> 00:33:03.770 align:middle line:84%
to be able to sustain
themselves because they did

00:33:03.770 --> 00:33:06.430 align:middle line:84%
lose their connection
at some point.

00:33:06.430 --> 00:33:08.900 align:middle line:84%
And I'm sure ultimately
they need to gain it

00:33:08.900 --> 00:33:10.770 align:middle line:90%
back just like we all do.

00:33:10.770 --> 00:33:13.370 align:middle line:84%
>> LARSON: Yes, and I've
been assisting with that

00:33:13.370 --> 00:33:16.375 align:middle line:84%
to the degree I'm able to
so that they can reconnect.

00:33:16.375 --> 00:33:17.850 align:middle line:90%
And I think a lot of us are.

00:33:17.850 --> 00:33:20.335 align:middle line:84%
So I'm just agreeing
with you, yes.

00:33:20.335 --> 00:33:21.210 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: I love it.

00:33:21.210 --> 00:33:23.730 align:middle line:10%
Now let's talk about
the story of bees,

00:33:23.730 --> 00:33:27.390 align:middle line:10%
because we have to
because I love this story.

00:33:27.390 --> 00:33:29.400 align:middle line:10%
Bee colonies.

00:33:29.400 --> 00:33:33.170 align:middle line:84%
>> LARSON: Well, bees are
beautiful in the sense that they

00:33:33.170 --> 00:33:35.228 align:middle line:84%
are communicating with
humans quite often.

00:33:35.228 --> 00:33:36.770 align:middle line:84%
And I think what
you may be referring

00:33:36.770 --> 00:33:38.700 align:middle line:90%
to is tell it to the bees.

00:33:38.700 --> 00:33:42.008 align:middle line:10%
>> REGINA: Yes, consciously
inform the bee colonies.

00:33:42.008 --> 00:33:43.050 align:middle line:10%
That's what I wrote down.

00:33:43.050 --> 00:33:44.925 align:middle line:84%
>> LARSON: If there's
a change in the family,

00:33:44.925 --> 00:33:47.540 align:middle line:84%
such as a marriage,
a birth, or a death,

00:33:47.540 --> 00:33:52.170 align:middle line:84%
it's important in some
cultures that raise bees,

00:33:52.170 --> 00:33:55.640 align:middle line:84%
they know that you need to tell
it to the bees so that they know

00:33:55.640 --> 00:33:58.390 align:middle line:84%
that someone that they love,
bees are very connected

00:33:58.390 --> 00:33:59.190 align:middle line:90%
to people.

00:33:59.190 --> 00:34:02.030 align:middle line:84%
It might be surprising
for humans to hear that.

00:34:02.030 --> 00:34:05.610 align:middle line:10%
We expect horses and dogs
and cats would be connected.

00:34:05.610 --> 00:34:08.900 align:middle line:10%
But even wild animals
like bees, they're

00:34:08.900 --> 00:34:11.040 align:middle line:10%
very connected with
their people too,

00:34:11.040 --> 00:34:14.250 align:middle line:10%
and they need to know
if someone's passed on

00:34:14.250 --> 00:34:17.199 align:middle line:10%
or if someone's coming
newly into the family.

00:34:17.199 --> 00:34:19.150 align:middle line:84%
And when there
have been funerals,

00:34:19.150 --> 00:34:23.860 align:middle line:84%
sometimes bees are known
to attend in remembrance.

00:34:23.860 --> 00:34:27.000 align:middle line:84%
It seems like they
gather in support

00:34:27.000 --> 00:34:30.510 align:middle line:90%
of that person who's passed on.

00:34:30.510 --> 00:34:34.230 align:middle line:10%
>> REGINA: So how would you
weave this into the story of all

00:34:34.230 --> 00:34:37.570 align:middle line:10%
these colony collapses
around the world?

00:34:37.570 --> 00:34:43.010 align:middle line:10%
With the chaos, consciousness as
it is, bee colonies collapsing.

00:34:43.010 --> 00:34:47.590 align:middle line:84%
I don't think we can just lay
it all off onto EMF frequencies.

00:34:47.590 --> 00:34:50.179 align:middle line:84%
I think there has to be
something beyond that going on.

00:34:50.179 --> 00:34:51.489 align:middle line:10%
>> LARSON: Probably there is.

00:34:51.489 --> 00:34:53.549 align:middle line:10%
I mean, the chemical
aspects as well.

00:34:53.549 --> 00:34:54.400 align:middle line:10%
>> REGINA: Chemical
aspects is worse.

00:34:54.400 --> 00:34:56.483 align:middle line:10%
>> LARSON: So once you've
covered all the physical

00:34:56.483 --> 00:35:00.430 align:middle line:10%
aspects, it matters that we're
connecting on a psychic heart

00:35:00.430 --> 00:35:02.570 align:middle line:10%
to heart basis
with all of nature,

00:35:02.570 --> 00:35:05.830 align:middle line:10%
including wild animals and
beings that we might not think

00:35:05.830 --> 00:35:06.950 align:middle line:10%
of as pets.

00:35:06.950 --> 00:35:08.950 align:middle line:84%
We might just think that
we harvest the honey

00:35:08.950 --> 00:35:09.883 align:middle line:90%
and we're using them.

00:35:09.883 --> 00:35:11.300 align:middle line:84%
But if we're using
them like that,

00:35:11.300 --> 00:35:13.130 align:middle line:90%
that's not the way forward.

00:35:13.130 --> 00:35:16.630 align:middle line:84%
That's not going to be
where we go from here.

00:35:16.630 --> 00:35:19.900 align:middle line:10%
So moving forward, we need to
be looking at all of the animals

00:35:19.900 --> 00:35:21.950 align:middle line:10%
that we partner
with, including bees,

00:35:21.950 --> 00:35:25.470 align:middle line:10%
as co-creators of
this new Earth.

00:35:25.470 --> 00:35:28.300 align:middle line:10%
>> REGINA: I loved reading that
because it's only been in recent

00:35:28.300 --> 00:35:31.000 align:middle line:10%
years that I've become not so
afraid of bees because of all

00:35:31.000 --> 00:35:35.110 align:middle line:10%
the bee stings historically
and you're a little kid.

00:35:35.110 --> 00:35:38.030 align:middle line:10%
So I have a laundry
line and live

00:35:38.030 --> 00:35:41.600 align:middle line:10%
in a very sunny, airy place,
and I'm hanging my laundry out

00:35:41.600 --> 00:35:44.630 align:middle line:10%
and I have all these bushes
around different butterfly

00:35:44.630 --> 00:35:46.290 align:middle line:10%
bush and lavender
and everything,

00:35:46.290 --> 00:35:48.620 align:middle line:10%
and they're all
buzzing around me

00:35:48.620 --> 00:35:52.310 align:middle line:10%
and it feels so nice just
to have them gently buzzing

00:35:52.310 --> 00:35:54.110 align:middle line:10%
while I'm hanging up laundry.

00:35:54.110 --> 00:35:58.960 align:middle line:84%
And now from learning
this to just talk to them.

00:35:58.960 --> 00:36:03.010 align:middle line:84%
>> LARSON: I love talking to
bees and flowers and trees.

00:36:03.010 --> 00:36:05.590 align:middle line:84%
They do appreciate
it, all of them do.

00:36:05.590 --> 00:36:06.880 align:middle line:90%
Gardeners know this.

00:36:06.880 --> 00:36:08.930 align:middle line:84%
People with a green
thumb, they know this.

00:36:08.930 --> 00:36:09.730 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHTER]

00:36:09.730 --> 00:36:11.900 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: They know
all about their bees.

00:36:11.900 --> 00:36:15.050 align:middle line:10%
So there's a quote
here that I wrote down.

00:36:15.050 --> 00:36:19.070 align:middle line:10%
It's from Jacob
Needleman and it said,

00:36:19.070 --> 00:36:21.710 align:middle line:10%
"There nothing but evidence.

00:36:21.710 --> 00:36:25.810 align:middle line:10%
But the evidence is all in
the inner world which requires

00:36:25.810 --> 00:36:32.450 align:middle line:10%
a special attitude of humility,
a wish for the truth and a sense

00:36:32.450 --> 00:36:33.350 align:middle line:10%
of the sacred."

00:36:33.350 --> 00:36:37.600 align:middle line:84%
So basically he's talking about
everything that's manifesting

00:36:37.600 --> 00:36:39.560 align:middle line:90%
this whole unseen world.

00:36:39.560 --> 00:36:41.930 align:middle line:10%
He's saying there's
nothing but evidence,

00:36:41.930 --> 00:36:44.320 align:middle line:10%
but it's evidence comes
from the inner world, which

00:36:44.320 --> 00:36:48.010 align:middle line:10%
requires humility, a
desire to know the truth,

00:36:48.010 --> 00:36:51.080 align:middle line:10%
and a sense of the sacred.

00:36:51.080 --> 00:36:53.980 align:middle line:84%
>> LARSON: What starts happening
as we explore these metaphysical

00:36:53.980 --> 00:36:56.437 align:middle line:84%
worlds where we are not
our physical bodies,

00:36:56.437 --> 00:36:59.020 align:middle line:84%
but we're so much more where all
that space that we're talking

00:36:59.020 --> 00:37:03.370 align:middle line:84%
about, it starts becoming
interdimensional and we access

00:37:03.370 --> 00:37:05.860 align:middle line:84%
this easily through
the subconscious rather

00:37:05.860 --> 00:37:07.730 align:middle line:90%
effortlessly, everybody does.

00:37:07.730 --> 00:37:10.360 align:middle line:84%
But we don't usually
practice it except meditators

00:37:10.360 --> 00:37:13.250 align:middle line:84%
and martial artists
and magicians perhaps.

00:37:13.250 --> 00:37:16.750 align:middle line:10%
So this purity of the
inner essence of who we are

00:37:16.750 --> 00:37:20.260 align:middle line:10%
is super important once we
start noticing that everyone

00:37:20.260 --> 00:37:22.360 align:middle line:10%
knows exactly what
we're thinking

00:37:22.360 --> 00:37:24.632 align:middle line:10%
and exactly what we're feeling.

00:37:24.632 --> 00:37:27.360 align:middle line:10%
I'm just going to put that out
to you and to the audience right

00:37:27.360 --> 00:37:28.160 align:middle line:10%
now.

00:37:28.160 --> 00:37:31.730 align:middle line:84%
If you start imagining what
would that world be like, well,

00:37:31.730 --> 00:37:33.580 align:middle line:84%
it's a whole different
world when everybody

00:37:33.580 --> 00:37:35.760 align:middle line:90%
knows what you're thinking.

00:37:35.760 --> 00:37:36.680 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Absolutely.

00:37:36.680 --> 00:37:38.120 align:middle line:10%
>> LARSON: Everything changes.

00:37:38.120 --> 00:37:40.640 align:middle line:10%
>> REGINA: Absolutely,
when we're transparent.

00:37:40.640 --> 00:37:42.220 align:middle line:90%
Where everyone is transparent.

00:37:42.220 --> 00:37:44.220 align:middle line:84%
>> LARSON: And we're
moving into that direction,

00:37:44.220 --> 00:37:45.780 align:middle line:84%
that's where we're
going with this.

00:37:45.780 --> 00:37:50.060 align:middle line:10%
We're going into an extremely
psychic telepathic world,

00:37:50.060 --> 00:37:51.420 align:middle line:10%
interdimensional.

00:37:51.420 --> 00:37:53.510 align:middle line:10%
So if you look at
a sheet of paper

00:37:53.510 --> 00:37:56.970 align:middle line:10%
that would be like flatland,
that's two dimensional reality.

00:37:56.970 --> 00:37:59.910 align:middle line:10%
And I can look down at
the floor plan of a house

00:37:59.910 --> 00:38:03.500 align:middle line:10%
and I can see where Mr. circle
is hiding from Mr. square.

00:38:03.500 --> 00:38:06.030 align:middle line:84%
And to me, it's obvious,
Mr. circle is in the closet.

00:38:06.030 --> 00:38:07.760 align:middle line:84%
But if you say that
to flatland, they'll

00:38:07.760 --> 00:38:10.050 align:middle line:84%
say, how do you know Mr.
circles in the closet?

00:38:10.050 --> 00:38:11.690 align:middle line:90%
What are you, a mind reader?

00:38:11.690 --> 00:38:14.160 align:middle line:84%
And I'm just
interdimensional, for me,

00:38:14.160 --> 00:38:16.320 align:middle line:84%
I'm using three
dimensions of space.

00:38:16.320 --> 00:38:18.870 align:middle line:84%
So when we become
interdimensional,

00:38:18.870 --> 00:38:21.600 align:middle line:84%
as we are doing right
now and that's for real,

00:38:21.600 --> 00:38:23.810 align:middle line:84%
this is absolutely
for real, then

00:38:23.810 --> 00:38:25.890 align:middle line:84%
we're starting to
see around corners.

00:38:25.890 --> 00:38:27.980 align:middle line:84%
We're starting to see
through, know things

00:38:27.980 --> 00:38:30.950 align:middle line:84%
that there's no way
that regular physics

00:38:30.950 --> 00:38:32.510 align:middle line:84%
or what we learned
in school would

00:38:32.510 --> 00:38:34.920 align:middle line:84%
say there's any reason for
us to know these things.

00:38:34.920 --> 00:38:37.580 align:middle line:84%
But we do know them
and they are correct.

00:38:37.580 --> 00:38:39.590 align:middle line:90%
And we see evidence of it.

00:38:39.590 --> 00:38:42.660 align:middle line:84%
And you've done this
spectacularly in the past

00:38:42.660 --> 00:38:43.460 align:middle line:90%
and I have too.

00:38:43.460 --> 00:38:46.490 align:middle line:84%
And when that happens,
then you know this is real

00:38:46.490 --> 00:38:49.730 align:middle line:84%
and it's exactly what Jacob
Needleman is pointing out.

00:38:49.730 --> 00:38:54.550 align:middle line:84%
It comes first from that purity
of the heart and the soul,

00:38:54.550 --> 00:38:57.530 align:middle line:84%
with no malevolent
intention whatsoever.

00:38:57.530 --> 00:39:01.250 align:middle line:84%
That's extremely important
because it's like cooking food.

00:39:01.250 --> 00:39:04.120 align:middle line:84%
You wouldn't want to put
poison in your Thanksgiving

00:39:04.120 --> 00:39:06.380 align:middle line:90%
or Christmas feast.

00:39:06.380 --> 00:39:08.590 align:middle line:84%
It's stupid, it's
silly, it's crazy.

00:39:08.590 --> 00:39:11.710 align:middle line:84%
But we typically think
nothing of putting

00:39:11.710 --> 00:39:13.205 align:middle line:90%
poisonous thoughts in what--

00:39:13.205 --> 00:39:14.080 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Very true.

00:39:14.080 --> 00:39:15.455 align:middle line:84%
>> LARSON: --what
we're creating.

00:39:15.455 --> 00:39:18.080 align:middle line:84%
And it's time to start growing
up and maturing on that level.

00:39:18.080 --> 00:39:20.050 align:middle line:84%
And that's what I love
about Needleman's quote.

00:39:20.050 --> 00:39:20.930 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Absolutely.

00:39:20.930 --> 00:39:22.597 align:middle line:84%
And a lot of people
hear that and think,

00:39:22.597 --> 00:39:24.328 align:middle line:84%
oh, my God, Big
Brother, everybody's

00:39:24.328 --> 00:39:25.370 align:middle line:90%
going to know everything.

00:39:25.370 --> 00:39:28.237 align:middle line:84%
They're going to put
chips in us and no, it's

00:39:28.237 --> 00:39:29.570 align:middle line:90%
going to happen quite naturally.

00:39:29.570 --> 00:39:35.950 align:middle line:84%
But the grace in this is that we
begin evolving at the same time

00:39:35.950 --> 00:39:38.570 align:middle line:84%
beyond those thoughts,
the negative thoughts that

00:39:38.570 --> 00:39:40.250 align:middle line:84%
are created by these
fear patterns that

00:39:40.250 --> 00:39:42.530 align:middle line:84%
have been instilled into
us, those are be gone.

00:39:42.530 --> 00:39:46.470 align:middle line:84%
So we don't have the same
malevolent, fearful thoughts.

00:39:46.470 --> 00:39:49.650 align:middle line:84%
So if we're transparent and
reading each other, who cares?

00:39:49.650 --> 00:39:51.630 align:middle line:84%
We'll be more on the
same page anyway.

00:39:51.630 --> 00:39:52.800 align:middle line:10%
>> LARSON: Exactly.

00:39:52.800 --> 00:39:55.290 align:middle line:10%
>> REGINA: So no hiding things
from each other anymore.

00:39:55.290 --> 00:39:56.707 align:middle line:84%
>> LARSON: That's
super important.

00:39:56.707 --> 00:39:59.990 align:middle line:84%
I got a leg up on that one
because I got intuitive advice

00:39:59.990 --> 00:40:02.723 align:middle line:84%
when I was growing up that
everyone can read my mind,

00:40:02.723 --> 00:40:04.140 align:middle line:84%
everyone knew what
I was thinking.

00:40:04.140 --> 00:40:06.917 align:middle line:84%
That was what my angels
told me and I believed them.

00:40:06.917 --> 00:40:08.750 align:middle line:84%
My dad, on the other
hand, was saying things

00:40:08.750 --> 00:40:10.860 align:middle line:84%
like, you can't read
my mind, but I could.

00:40:10.860 --> 00:40:13.823 align:middle line:84%
And so then instantly
I went with my angels,

00:40:13.823 --> 00:40:15.740 align:middle line:84%
like, well, they're right
because obviously, I

00:40:15.740 --> 00:40:18.080 align:middle line:90%
can read his mind clearly.

00:40:18.080 --> 00:40:19.350 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: So they're dad.

00:40:19.350 --> 00:40:22.040 align:middle line:84%
>> LARSON: But it was a big
advantage because then it kept

00:40:22.040 --> 00:40:22.890 align:middle line:90%
my heart pure.

00:40:22.890 --> 00:40:24.410 align:middle line:84%
It kept me on the path
Needleman is talking about.

00:40:24.410 --> 00:40:25.980 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Oh, that's wonderful.

00:40:25.980 --> 00:40:27.630 align:middle line:90%
You got a way early jump on it.

00:40:27.630 --> 00:40:28.230 align:middle line:90%
>> LARSON: It was helpful.

00:40:28.230 --> 00:40:29.897 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: One other
thing before we go,

00:40:29.897 --> 00:40:32.090 align:middle line:90%
the notion of soft eyes.

00:40:32.090 --> 00:40:33.510 align:middle line:90%
Let's talk about soft eyes.

00:40:33.510 --> 00:40:34.932 align:middle line:90%
We just have a few minutes left.

00:40:34.932 --> 00:40:36.390 align:middle line:84%
>> LARSON: Well,
this is important.

00:40:36.390 --> 00:40:38.515 align:middle line:84%
If you love nature, we're
talking about hanging out

00:40:38.515 --> 00:40:39.500 align:middle line:90%
in the garden.

00:40:39.500 --> 00:40:41.540 align:middle line:10%
And so if you have
soft eyes, you

00:40:41.540 --> 00:40:44.240 align:middle line:10%
can be putting
laundry on the line

00:40:44.240 --> 00:40:47.990 align:middle line:10%
and just be aware maybe a bird
flies next to you and lands

00:40:47.990 --> 00:40:48.930 align:middle line:10%
on a branch.

00:40:48.930 --> 00:40:50.420 align:middle line:10%
But instead of
spinning your head

00:40:50.420 --> 00:40:52.800 align:middle line:10%
and staring at it
in a shocking way,

00:40:52.800 --> 00:40:56.990 align:middle line:10%
you can greet it with soft eyes
just with the visual perimeter

00:40:56.990 --> 00:41:00.020 align:middle line:10%
of your vision and knowing
there's a blue jay right

00:41:00.020 --> 00:41:03.140 align:middle line:10%
at eye level, 2 feet
away from me, wow,

00:41:03.140 --> 00:41:05.540 align:middle line:10%
and just extending a feeling
of love from your heart

00:41:05.540 --> 00:41:06.600 align:middle line:10%
to the bird.

00:41:06.600 --> 00:41:08.480 align:middle line:10%
And that's soft
eyes, and it starts

00:41:08.480 --> 00:41:11.540 align:middle line:10%
giving you an enhanced
expanded awareness

00:41:11.540 --> 00:41:13.058 align:middle line:10%
of all of the nature around.

00:41:13.058 --> 00:41:14.225 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: That makes sense.

00:41:14.225 --> 00:41:17.420 align:middle line:84%
If we have a lot of
birds and hummingbirds,

00:41:17.420 --> 00:41:20.270 align:middle line:84%
they'll just come and stare
at you, buzz right around

00:41:20.270 --> 00:41:22.170 align:middle line:90%
and try to get your attention.

00:41:22.170 --> 00:41:26.570 align:middle line:84%
And I have a hawk, I named
him Horus, of course.

00:41:26.570 --> 00:41:29.000 align:middle line:84%
There's a beautiful
hawk who lives

00:41:29.000 --> 00:41:30.750 align:middle line:84%
in the tree right
above my bedroom

00:41:30.750 --> 00:41:35.330 align:middle line:84%
and I really believe he's
looking over us and modulating

00:41:35.330 --> 00:41:36.140 align:middle line:90%
things a bit.

00:41:36.140 --> 00:41:38.140 align:middle line:10%
And I hear him go
off in the morning

00:41:38.140 --> 00:41:40.330 align:middle line:10%
screeching in the
morning, but I haven't

00:41:40.330 --> 00:41:44.140 align:middle line:10%
been able to decipher
why he does that.

00:41:44.140 --> 00:41:48.220 align:middle line:10%
And I would like to be able to
become more psychically tuned

00:41:48.220 --> 00:41:50.540 align:middle line:10%
to the animals, to the
birds in particular,

00:41:50.540 --> 00:41:52.602 align:middle line:10%
to know why they're
talking like they are

00:41:52.602 --> 00:41:53.810 align:middle line:10%
and doing what they're doing.

00:41:53.810 --> 00:41:56.390 align:middle line:90%
So soft eyes might be a path.

00:41:56.390 --> 00:41:59.080 align:middle line:84%
>> LARSON: It moves us into that
subconscious awareness and then

00:41:59.080 --> 00:42:01.480 align:middle line:84%
you've got that much
more instant access.

00:42:01.480 --> 00:42:04.630 align:middle line:10%
It's like flipping your
rational analytical left brain

00:42:04.630 --> 00:42:07.090 align:middle line:10%
off a little bit
more, and then you

00:42:07.090 --> 00:42:09.742 align:middle line:10%
have a little bit more knowledge
of what's really going on.

00:42:09.742 --> 00:42:12.200 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: Yeah, because I
think you're screeching so much.

00:42:12.200 --> 00:42:14.230 align:middle line:84%
If you're going
for prey, are you

00:42:14.230 --> 00:42:16.160 align:middle line:84%
trying to scare
them out or away?

00:42:16.160 --> 00:42:18.550 align:middle line:84%
I can't tell exactly
what you're doing.

00:42:18.550 --> 00:42:20.470 align:middle line:90%
He's beautiful anyway.

00:42:20.470 --> 00:42:24.220 align:middle line:10%
Well, listen, I so appreciate
you being here and everything

00:42:24.220 --> 00:42:25.580 align:middle line:10%
that you shared with us today.

00:42:25.580 --> 00:42:27.980 align:middle line:10%
And of course, we're
going to, I think,

00:42:27.980 --> 00:42:31.150 align:middle line:10%
close on the most powerful
question we can ever

00:42:31.150 --> 00:42:35.110 align:middle line:10%
ask ourselves because it's
audacious in this crazy world

00:42:35.110 --> 00:42:37.560 align:middle line:10%
where everybody's trying
to compete with each other.

00:42:37.560 --> 00:42:41.100 align:middle line:84%
So let's end it on
your famous question.

00:42:41.100 --> 00:42:44.095 align:middle line:10%
>> LARSON: My favorite
question, how good can it get?

00:42:44.095 --> 00:42:44.970 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: I love it.

00:42:44.970 --> 00:42:47.420 align:middle line:84%
>> LARSON: And it's an
invitation to the subconscious

00:42:47.420 --> 00:42:50.220 align:middle line:84%
as well to answer that
for us collectively,

00:42:50.220 --> 00:42:53.120 align:middle line:84%
not just how good can it get
for me and not just for the two

00:42:53.120 --> 00:42:56.420 align:middle line:84%
of us, but for everyone
and all concerned.

00:42:56.420 --> 00:42:57.380 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Perfect.

00:42:57.380 --> 00:42:59.940 align:middle line:84%
On that note, until next
time, thank you so much.

00:42:59.940 --> 00:43:01.350 align:middle line:90%
>> LARSON: Thank you.

00:43:01.350 --> 00:43:03.840 align:middle line:10%
>> REGINA: Cynthia Sue's new
book is titled The Mandela
