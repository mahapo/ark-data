[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:00:16.562 --> 00:00:18.020 align:middle line:10%
>>REGINA MEREDITH:
I'm sitting here

00:00:18.020 --> 00:00:20.510 align:middle line:10%
with David Icke, who is
perhaps my favorite interviewee

00:00:20.510 --> 00:00:22.400 align:middle line:10%
of all times, which
is why this is

00:00:22.400 --> 00:00:24.639 align:middle line:10%
our eighth
conversation together.

00:00:24.639 --> 00:00:25.930 align:middle line:90%
>>DAVID ICKE: Whoa, time flies.

00:00:25.930 --> 00:00:26.680 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: It does.

00:00:26.680 --> 00:00:28.612 align:middle line:84%
>>ICKE: It doesn't
exist, but it flies.

00:00:28.612 --> 00:00:29.320 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Indeed.

00:00:29.320 --> 00:00:30.800 align:middle line:84%
>>ICKE: It's my
favorite number, eight.

00:00:30.800 --> 00:00:31.470 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: It's my
favorite number, too.

00:00:31.470 --> 00:00:32.159 align:middle line:90%
How could we have arranged it?

00:00:32.159 --> 00:00:34.700 align:middle line:84%
>>ICKE: When I was a kid playing
football, little boy playing

00:00:34.700 --> 00:00:38.865 align:middle line:84%
football for the first time,
and I could get a shirt

00:00:38.865 --> 00:00:41.390 align:middle line:84%
and pick a shirt, I always
picked number eight shirt,

00:00:41.390 --> 00:00:42.110 align:middle line:90%
always.

00:00:42.110 --> 00:00:43.560 align:middle line:90%
I live in number eight, now.

00:00:43.560 --> 00:00:45.018 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: You live
in number eight?

00:00:45.018 --> 00:00:45.530 align:middle line:90%
Your home?

00:00:45.530 --> 00:00:46.030 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:00:46.030 --> 00:00:46.571 align:middle line:90%
There we are.

00:00:46.571 --> 00:00:49.850 align:middle line:10%
Then that means the stars
are with us on this one.

00:00:49.850 --> 00:00:52.070 align:middle line:10%
And the thing is, as much
as I have talked to you,

00:00:52.070 --> 00:00:54.520 align:middle line:10%
your information is
always progressing.

00:00:54.520 --> 00:00:55.540 align:middle line:10%
>>ICKE: Well, it has to.

00:00:55.540 --> 00:01:01.350 align:middle line:10%
Because there was an ancient
Greek philosopher called

00:01:01.350 --> 00:01:04.400 align:middle line:10%
Socrates who was apparently
supposed to have said,

00:01:04.400 --> 00:01:06.740 align:middle line:10%
"Wisdom is knowing
how little we know."

00:01:06.740 --> 00:01:08.970 align:middle line:10%
There's many things about that.

00:01:08.970 --> 00:01:11.060 align:middle line:84%
First of all, wisdom
is knowing how little

00:01:11.060 --> 00:01:14.280 align:middle line:84%
we know keeps your mind
open to all possibility,

00:01:14.280 --> 00:01:17.490 align:middle line:84%
instead of boom,
no one's coming in.

00:01:17.490 --> 00:01:18.164 align:middle line:90%
I've sussed it.

00:01:18.164 --> 00:01:19.330 align:middle line:90%
Well, you haven't, have you?

00:01:19.330 --> 00:01:21.640 align:middle line:84%
I mean, you're in a
body, in this reality,

00:01:21.640 --> 00:01:23.319 align:middle line:90%
in this manipulated reality.

00:01:23.319 --> 00:01:24.610 align:middle line:90%
And there's infinity out there.

00:01:24.610 --> 00:01:25.660 align:middle line:84%
You have not sussed
it, have you?

00:01:25.660 --> 00:01:26.800 align:middle line:90%
None of us have, OK?

00:01:26.800 --> 00:01:28.180 align:middle line:90%
So there must be more to know.

00:01:28.180 --> 00:01:30.050 align:middle line:90%
So that's one level of it.

00:01:30.050 --> 00:01:37.040 align:middle line:84%
And yeah, the side of
keeping your mind open

00:01:37.040 --> 00:01:39.280 align:middle line:84%
means you're open
to all possibility.

00:01:39.280 --> 00:01:42.906 align:middle line:84%
And at all times you know
that whatever you know

00:01:42.906 --> 00:01:44.530 align:middle line:84%
is a fraction of what
there is to know.

00:01:44.530 --> 00:01:48.870 align:middle line:84%
So if your cutting edge
is not moving constantly,

00:01:48.870 --> 00:01:50.420 align:middle line:90%
what have you been doing?

00:01:50.420 --> 00:01:54.280 align:middle line:10%
And you know, over the years
I've traveled around the world.

00:01:54.280 --> 00:01:58.485 align:middle line:10%
And in the older days went
to multi-speaker conferences

00:01:58.485 --> 00:01:59.110 align:middle line:10%
and stuff like.

00:01:59.110 --> 00:02:02.650 align:middle line:10%
And I watched people speak and
I thought, that was interesting.

00:02:02.650 --> 00:02:06.040 align:middle line:84%
And then maybe 10 years later
I'd see them speak again,

00:02:06.040 --> 00:02:07.710 align:middle line:84%
and they're saying
the same thing.

00:02:07.710 --> 00:02:08.135 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: That's true.

00:02:08.135 --> 00:02:08.635 align:middle line:90%
It's true.

00:02:08.635 --> 00:02:11.700 align:middle line:84%
>>ICKE: And it's like,
how is that possible?

00:02:11.700 --> 00:02:14.710 align:middle line:84%
It's like everyone
seems to-- not everyone,

00:02:14.710 --> 00:02:17.210 align:middle line:84%
but most people--
seem to have a niche.

00:02:17.210 --> 00:02:19.320 align:middle line:84%
And they sit back and
it, and it's comfortable.

00:02:19.320 --> 00:02:20.082 align:middle line:90%
Oh, I like that.

00:02:20.082 --> 00:02:21.350 align:middle line:90%
I like that.

00:02:21.350 --> 00:02:22.870 align:middle line:90%
And they don't want to move.

00:02:22.870 --> 00:02:26.215 align:middle line:84%
And if we don't move, then we
stay where we are, clearly.

00:02:26.215 --> 00:02:29.170 align:middle line:84%
And if we stay where we
are, then what we know

00:02:29.170 --> 00:02:30.220 align:middle line:90%
stays with us.

00:02:30.220 --> 00:02:31.150 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Well, and
that's the thing.

00:02:31.150 --> 00:02:33.358 align:middle line:84%
And a lot of those people--
and I know a lot of them.

00:02:33.358 --> 00:02:36.520 align:middle line:84%
I've interviewed some lovely
people who, that's their story.

00:02:36.520 --> 00:02:38.790 align:middle line:84%
And one way to look
at it, I suppose,

00:02:38.790 --> 00:02:41.320 align:middle line:84%
is that we have this
incredible portrait

00:02:41.320 --> 00:02:43.950 align:middle line:90%
of humanity's story emerging.

00:02:43.950 --> 00:02:46.700 align:middle line:84%
And people are
supplying pixels of it.

00:02:46.700 --> 00:02:50.500 align:middle line:84%
And perhaps that's
one static pixel of it

00:02:50.500 --> 00:02:52.140 align:middle line:84%
that's bound to start
growing and being

00:02:52.140 --> 00:02:53.400 align:middle line:90%
expressed by someone else.

00:02:53.400 --> 00:02:56.190 align:middle line:84%
And oftentimes if a person
can't move the story along,

00:02:56.190 --> 00:02:57.150 align:middle line:90%
that's the end of that.

00:02:57.150 --> 00:03:01.360 align:middle line:84%
Because we as a species are
now hungry for the story.

00:03:01.360 --> 00:03:02.950 align:middle line:90%
We want the whole story.

00:03:02.950 --> 00:03:04.906 align:middle line:84%
And I think everybody
watching this today

00:03:04.906 --> 00:03:06.280 align:middle line:84%
wouldn't be watching
it unless we

00:03:06.280 --> 00:03:08.030 align:middle line:84%
were in the same
mindset, which is

00:03:08.030 --> 00:03:10.460 align:middle line:84%
we want to go beyond what's
been comfortable for us.

00:03:10.460 --> 00:03:12.390 align:middle line:84%
And you make people
very uncomfortable.

00:03:12.390 --> 00:03:14.986 align:middle line:84%
And you have, historically,
for the last 20 years

00:03:14.986 --> 00:03:16.360 align:middle line:84%
been making people
uncomfortable.

00:03:16.360 --> 00:03:18.570 align:middle line:84%
Because everything you're
doing is taking them

00:03:18.570 --> 00:03:21.470 align:middle line:84%
beyond wherever they
left off with you.

00:03:21.470 --> 00:03:23.530 align:middle line:90%
And that there's last--

00:03:23.530 --> 00:03:26.640 align:middle line:84%
>>ICKE: Again, it's
the same situation

00:03:26.640 --> 00:03:31.270 align:middle line:84%
where-- I remember my
mother, no longer with us.

00:03:31.270 --> 00:03:33.700 align:middle line:84%
Well, actually she is,
but she's not here.

00:03:33.700 --> 00:03:35.860 align:middle line:84%
And people would
knock on the door,

00:03:35.860 --> 00:03:39.870 align:middle line:84%
like Jehovah's Witnesses or
something, And she'd say,

00:03:39.870 --> 00:03:41.560 align:middle line:90%
we're Church of England.

00:03:41.560 --> 00:03:43.170 align:middle line:90%
And that would be it.

00:03:43.170 --> 00:03:46.100 align:middle line:84%
But we'd never been in a bloody
church, except for weddings.

00:03:46.100 --> 00:03:49.330 align:middle line:84%
But she'd sorted a
spirituality out, right?

00:03:49.330 --> 00:03:52.790 align:middle line:84%
We're Church of England
and that was the end of it.

00:03:52.790 --> 00:03:55.960 align:middle line:84%
And it's like people like
to-- they find a comfort,

00:03:55.960 --> 00:04:01.820 align:middle line:84%
they find a security in coming
to a conclusion about life.

00:04:01.820 --> 00:04:03.850 align:middle line:90%
And then they sit on it.

00:04:03.850 --> 00:04:06.080 align:middle line:84%
And that conclusion
never moves on.

00:04:06.080 --> 00:04:10.600 align:middle line:84%
Because when you're dealing
with infinite awareness, which

00:04:10.600 --> 00:04:14.430 align:middle line:84%
is what we are and what
everything is, infinite

00:04:14.430 --> 00:04:22.830 align:middle line:84%
possibility-- then
once you coagulate

00:04:22.830 --> 00:04:29.910 align:middle line:84%
your perception into this
is it, and it doesn't move,

00:04:29.910 --> 00:04:34.700 align:middle line:84%
you're already confirming that
you're miles off the pace.

00:04:34.700 --> 00:04:41.580 align:middle line:84%
If I'm not understanding at
least some more this time

00:04:41.580 --> 00:04:44.001 align:middle line:84%
next week than I am now,
then what have I been doing?

00:04:44.001 --> 00:04:45.250 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: I feel the same way.

00:04:45.250 --> 00:04:46.240 align:middle line:90%
It's about growth.

00:04:46.240 --> 00:04:48.880 align:middle line:84%
Life is about growth and
learning and adapting.

00:04:48.880 --> 00:04:50.930 align:middle line:84%
And a lot of people
are having to adapt now

00:04:50.930 --> 00:04:54.900 align:middle line:84%
because the external world is
not supporting them in the way

00:04:54.900 --> 00:04:57.010 align:middle line:84%
that they have expected
it would turn out.

00:04:57.010 --> 00:04:59.250 align:middle line:90%
And you've had much to say.

00:04:59.250 --> 00:05:03.210 align:middle line:84%
And again, I would refer you
to our last seven interviews

00:05:03.210 --> 00:05:05.640 align:middle line:84%
to go over some of what we've
talked about in the past.

00:05:05.640 --> 00:05:07.450 align:middle line:84%
Things haven't turned
out for a reason.

00:05:07.450 --> 00:05:10.430 align:middle line:84%
And we're now in this
really critical period

00:05:10.430 --> 00:05:14.460 align:middle line:84%
of time in which we're looking
at a potential dissolution

00:05:14.460 --> 00:05:17.360 align:middle line:84%
of the euro, which is chaos
throughout the economy

00:05:17.360 --> 00:05:18.410 align:middle line:90%
and the Western world.

00:05:18.410 --> 00:05:20.060 align:middle line:84%
Same thing in the
United States--

00:05:20.060 --> 00:05:22.220 align:middle line:84%
we're in England
right now as we speak.

00:05:22.220 --> 00:05:27.040 align:middle line:84%
And the whole money game,
just the money game itself,

00:05:27.040 --> 00:05:30.700 align:middle line:84%
is essentially key to the
underpinnings of everything

00:05:30.700 --> 00:05:32.770 align:middle line:84%
else we thought was going
to happen in our lives,

00:05:32.770 --> 00:05:35.670 align:middle line:84%
in this materialistic
aspect of life.

00:05:35.670 --> 00:05:37.710 align:middle line:84%
>>ICKE: What we're
looking at, Regina,

00:05:37.710 --> 00:05:43.500 align:middle line:84%
is a dissolution of
everything that humanity

00:05:43.500 --> 00:05:46.970 align:middle line:84%
has perceived to be
life as they know it.

00:05:46.970 --> 00:05:53.090 align:middle line:84%
Freedom of whatever you want
to put after that, long list--

00:05:53.090 --> 00:05:57.190 align:middle line:84%
freedom of speech,
freedom of movement,

00:05:57.190 --> 00:05:59.700 align:middle line:90%
freedom of all this stuff.

00:05:59.700 --> 00:06:00.900 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Financial freedom.

00:06:00.900 --> 00:06:04.270 align:middle line:84%
>>ICKE: Yeah, we're looking at
the dissolution of all that.

00:06:04.270 --> 00:06:08.280 align:middle line:84%
Because there has been
a force manipulating--

00:06:08.280 --> 00:06:11.170 align:middle line:84%
the ancient cultures
talked about it

00:06:11.170 --> 00:06:12.790 align:middle line:84%
and they used
different names for it.

00:06:12.790 --> 00:06:14.530 align:middle line:84%
But it was the same
force, described

00:06:14.530 --> 00:06:16.380 align:middle line:90%
in pretty much the same way.

00:06:16.380 --> 00:06:22.100 align:middle line:84%
And it infiltrates
human perception.

00:06:22.100 --> 00:06:25.510 align:middle line:84%
See, when you have currently,
I don't know who counts them,

00:06:25.510 --> 00:06:29.080 align:middle line:84%
but more than 7 billion
people on the planet--

00:06:29.080 --> 00:06:33.969 align:middle line:84%
you can't control 7 billion
with tanks in the streets

00:06:33.969 --> 00:06:35.010 align:middle line:90%
and soldiers at the door.

00:06:35.010 --> 00:06:37.080 align:middle line:90%
You've not got enough.

00:06:37.080 --> 00:06:40.530 align:middle line:84%
What you have to do is
manipulate the perception

00:06:40.530 --> 00:06:46.270 align:middle line:84%
of self, the world, and
world events of those people

00:06:46.270 --> 00:06:49.560 align:middle line:84%
so that they perceive
themselves in terms

00:06:49.560 --> 00:06:52.780 align:middle line:84%
of their limitation of
potential, of possibility.

00:06:52.780 --> 00:06:55.110 align:middle line:84%
And they see the
world in ways that

00:06:55.110 --> 00:06:59.150 align:middle line:84%
suit those that are
behind all this.

00:06:59.150 --> 00:07:02.830 align:middle line:84%
When you look at all these
different aspects of what's

00:07:02.830 --> 00:07:07.870 align:middle line:84%
happening in the world from
a suppression point of view,

00:07:07.870 --> 00:07:11.680 align:middle line:84%
surveillance, lack
of privacy, cameras

00:07:11.680 --> 00:07:15.160 align:middle line:84%
in the streets, all
this stuff-- then

00:07:15.160 --> 00:07:19.330 align:middle line:84%
that's come about
by the manipulation

00:07:19.330 --> 00:07:21.530 align:middle line:90%
of human perception.

00:07:21.530 --> 00:07:25.510 align:middle line:84%
The whole foundation of it,
and what expresses itself

00:07:25.510 --> 00:07:30.620 align:middle line:84%
in all those ways, is to
get people to see themselves

00:07:30.620 --> 00:07:31.870 align:middle line:90%
and the world in certain ways.

00:07:31.870 --> 00:07:34.080 align:middle line:90%
So it's a mind game.

00:07:34.080 --> 00:07:38.590 align:middle line:84%
It's the manipulation
of perception.

00:07:38.590 --> 00:07:45.700 align:middle line:84%
And one of the greatest forms
of suppression and manipulation

00:07:45.700 --> 00:07:50.080 align:middle line:84%
of perception is
the manipulation

00:07:50.080 --> 00:07:53.080 align:middle line:90%
of the sense of the possible.

00:07:53.080 --> 00:07:55.130 align:middle line:84%
Not many people seem
to talk about this,

00:07:55.130 --> 00:07:58.740 align:middle line:84%
but it is fundamental
to why people

00:07:58.740 --> 00:08:04.390 align:middle line:84%
live in-- I see, I get this
picture of a honeycomb.

00:08:04.390 --> 00:08:07.340 align:middle line:84%
And there's people in
the different sections

00:08:07.340 --> 00:08:08.630 align:middle line:90%
of the honeycomb.

00:08:08.630 --> 00:08:09.530 align:middle line:90%
I'm a Christian.

00:08:09.530 --> 00:08:10.540 align:middle line:90%
This is my honeycomb.

00:08:10.540 --> 00:08:11.315 align:middle line:90%
Oh, I'm a Muslim.

00:08:11.315 --> 00:08:12.190 align:middle line:90%
This is my honeycomb.

00:08:12.190 --> 00:08:13.400 align:middle line:90%
I'm a Republican.

00:08:13.400 --> 00:08:14.850 align:middle line:90%
This is my honeycomb.

00:08:14.850 --> 00:08:17.700 align:middle line:90%
And so on it goes.

00:08:17.700 --> 00:08:24.330 align:middle line:84%
And they are all,
in their own way,

00:08:24.330 --> 00:08:28.350 align:middle line:84%
suppressed and enslaved
by a limitation

00:08:28.350 --> 00:08:30.400 align:middle line:90%
of the sense of the possible.

00:08:30.400 --> 00:08:34.020 align:middle line:90%
Give you a very simple example.

00:08:34.020 --> 00:08:38.190 align:middle line:84%
If you do not
perceive that it is

00:08:38.190 --> 00:08:44.870 align:middle line:84%
possible to mind control someone
so that he will go and do

00:08:44.870 --> 00:08:47.930 align:middle line:84%
a mass shooting or be in the
wrong place at the wrong time

00:08:47.930 --> 00:08:51.060 align:middle line:84%
to be blamed for it when
someone else has done it, then

00:08:51.060 --> 00:08:54.070 align:middle line:84%
when something like
Aurora happens,

00:08:54.070 --> 00:08:57.840 align:middle line:84%
you will not even question
the official story.

00:08:57.840 --> 00:09:01.800 align:middle line:84%
Because to you, there
is no alternative

00:09:01.800 --> 00:09:05.240 align:middle line:84%
to the official story
because you are not

00:09:05.240 --> 00:09:07.210 align:middle line:84%
perceiving as
possible that anything

00:09:07.210 --> 00:09:09.460 align:middle line:84%
other than the official
story could happen.

00:09:09.460 --> 00:09:16.140 align:middle line:84%
And what I'm seeing when
I look at so many people,

00:09:16.140 --> 00:09:19.540 align:middle line:90%
I see a standing wave.

00:09:19.540 --> 00:09:24.490 align:middle line:84%
A standing wave where two
waves of basically equal power

00:09:24.490 --> 00:09:26.220 align:middle line:84%
are smacking into
each other and they

00:09:26.220 --> 00:09:28.820 align:middle line:84%
create a standing wave,
which is basically

00:09:28.820 --> 00:09:31.710 align:middle line:84%
like vibrationally
running on the spot.

00:09:31.710 --> 00:09:35.510 align:middle line:84%
And one of these
waves is the lie.

00:09:35.510 --> 00:09:42.080 align:middle line:84%
The other of these waves is
the suppression and limitation

00:09:42.080 --> 00:09:44.500 align:middle line:90%
of the sense of the possible.

00:09:44.500 --> 00:09:47.420 align:middle line:84%
which starts a standing
wave with the lie.

00:09:47.420 --> 00:09:53.110 align:middle line:84%
So the lie says this lad
dressed up as the Joker,

00:09:53.110 --> 00:09:54.350 align:middle line:90%
went into a cinema.

00:09:54.350 --> 00:09:57.290 align:middle line:84%
Someone actually let him in
as the people in the cinema,

00:09:57.290 --> 00:09:58.500 align:middle line:90%
some of them have said.

00:09:58.500 --> 00:10:01.970 align:middle line:84%
Goes crazy with a
gun-- there's the lie.

00:10:01.970 --> 00:10:07.780 align:middle line:84%
Now what should happen now is an
open mind then says, well what

00:10:07.780 --> 00:10:10.790 align:middle line:84%
could have happened other
than the official story?

00:10:10.790 --> 00:10:14.960 align:middle line:84%
But the limitation of the
sense of the possible cannot go

00:10:14.960 --> 00:10:15.860 align:middle line:90%
there.

00:10:15.860 --> 00:10:19.580 align:middle line:84%
Because there's no such thing
as mind control like that.

00:10:19.580 --> 00:10:22.020 align:middle line:84%
Boom, boom, and it sets
up the standing wave

00:10:22.020 --> 00:10:24.800 align:middle line:90%
in which the lie is dominant.

00:10:24.800 --> 00:10:29.140 align:middle line:84%
For instance human
caused global warming--

00:10:29.140 --> 00:10:34.100 align:middle line:90%
it's a scientific nonsense.

00:10:34.100 --> 00:10:38.040 align:middle line:84%
But if you do not open
your mind, your sense

00:10:38.040 --> 00:10:43.250 align:middle line:84%
of the possible, to the fact
that there are networks that

00:10:43.250 --> 00:10:46.920 align:middle line:84%
want to sell the lie because
it allows them to make changes

00:10:46.920 --> 00:10:48.430 align:middle line:84%
in the world that
without the lie

00:10:48.430 --> 00:10:51.140 align:middle line:84%
would not be able
to be justified,

00:10:51.140 --> 00:10:53.100 align:middle line:84%
then your sense of the
possible-- no, that

00:10:53.100 --> 00:10:54.870 align:middle line:84%
can't be going
on, no, that can't

00:10:54.870 --> 00:10:57.640 align:middle line:84%
be going on--
bounces with the lie.

00:10:57.640 --> 00:11:02.000 align:middle line:84%
And all you can perceive in
your mind is the official story.

00:11:02.000 --> 00:11:04.740 align:middle line:90%
And this applies to everything.

00:11:04.740 --> 00:11:06.990 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Absolutely, and I
want to go back to Aurora.

00:11:06.990 --> 00:11:08.990 align:middle line:84%
Because that's a
really good point.

00:11:08.990 --> 00:11:12.494 align:middle line:84%
That's something that has a
charge for a lot of people,

00:11:12.494 --> 00:11:14.410 align:middle line:84%
not just in the United
States, but everywhere.

00:11:14.410 --> 00:11:16.715 align:middle line:84%
And a lot of it comes
from the picture

00:11:16.715 --> 00:11:18.980 align:middle line:90%
of his face in the courtroom.

00:11:18.980 --> 00:11:21.820 align:middle line:84%
When you look at his
face in the courtroom,

00:11:21.820 --> 00:11:23.850 align:middle line:84%
almost everybody
that's looked at it

00:11:23.850 --> 00:11:26.940 align:middle line:84%
has said the same thing which
is, he wasn't all there.

00:11:26.940 --> 00:11:28.240 align:middle line:90%
There was no one home.

00:11:28.240 --> 00:11:30.120 align:middle line:84%
He didn't appear to
even know where he was

00:11:30.120 --> 00:11:31.550 align:middle line:90%
or what he was doing.

00:11:31.550 --> 00:11:36.630 align:middle line:84%
Now that brings up a set of
intuitive feelings in the body,

00:11:36.630 --> 00:11:40.440 align:middle line:84%
in the mind, and we're
going to get into this.

00:11:40.440 --> 00:11:42.860 align:middle line:84%
Where it's like, hmm, he doesn't
look like he's all there.

00:11:42.860 --> 00:11:47.720 align:middle line:84%
Then you read that one of the
jailers, one of the guards,

00:11:47.720 --> 00:11:51.080 align:middle line:84%
said he asked him,
why am I here?

00:11:51.080 --> 00:11:52.740 align:middle line:90%
I don't know what I've done.

00:11:52.740 --> 00:11:53.800 align:middle line:90%
What have I done?

00:11:53.800 --> 00:11:55.340 align:middle line:84%
And started asking
these questions.

00:11:55.340 --> 00:11:57.630 align:middle line:84%
Same with Sirhan Sirhan
and the Bobby Kennedy

00:11:57.630 --> 00:11:58.580 align:middle line:90%
shooting and such.

00:11:58.580 --> 00:12:02.270 align:middle line:84%
You start looking at it-- I
can feel something's not right.

00:12:02.270 --> 00:12:04.700 align:middle line:84%
If I don't know anything
else, I can feel it.

00:12:04.700 --> 00:12:08.640 align:middle line:84%
Why is it that we cannot
allow ourselves, oh, no, no,

00:12:08.640 --> 00:12:10.790 align:middle line:90%
the media says something else.

00:12:10.790 --> 00:12:14.045 align:middle line:84%
That's the bridge there you're
talking about, isn't it?

00:12:14.045 --> 00:12:18.860 align:middle line:84%
>>ICKE: Yes, the
sense of the possible

00:12:18.860 --> 00:12:24.360 align:middle line:84%
will not, in most people, open
itself to encompass the fact

00:12:24.360 --> 00:12:30.210 align:middle line:84%
that the media at ownership
level, the intelligence

00:12:30.210 --> 00:12:34.780 align:middle line:84%
and enforcement agencies at
the peaks of their pyramids

00:12:34.780 --> 00:12:37.220 align:middle line:84%
where the decisions are
made-- not every person that

00:12:37.220 --> 00:12:40.070 align:middle line:84%
works in them, but the key
positions of power and decision

00:12:40.070 --> 00:12:44.080 align:middle line:84%
making-- that
political parties that

00:12:44.080 --> 00:12:45.970 align:middle line:84%
have any chance of
forming a government,

00:12:45.970 --> 00:12:48.030 align:middle line:84%
that the pharmaceutical
industry,

00:12:48.030 --> 00:12:51.110 align:middle line:84%
that the biotech industry,
on and on and on,

00:12:51.110 --> 00:12:54.950 align:middle line:84%
that the banking cabal
globally, could all, in the end,

00:12:54.950 --> 00:12:58.010 align:middle line:84%
be controlled by the
same network of people.

00:12:58.010 --> 00:13:04.280 align:middle line:84%
Because in the public arena
they are presented as dots.

00:13:04.280 --> 00:13:05.490 align:middle line:90%
They're not dots.

00:13:05.490 --> 00:13:10.180 align:middle line:84%
They're a tapestry of connected
dots which go, in the end,

00:13:10.180 --> 00:13:11.800 align:middle line:90%
to the same people.

00:13:11.800 --> 00:13:16.270 align:middle line:84%
And there is an agenda
that was-- in many ways,

00:13:16.270 --> 00:13:19.080 align:middle line:84%
it was understated
but it was well

00:13:19.080 --> 00:13:22.700 align:middle line:84%
set out by George
Orwell in "1984"

00:13:22.700 --> 00:13:26.740 align:middle line:84%
and by Aldous Huxley
in "Brave New World."

00:13:26.740 --> 00:13:29.280 align:middle line:90%
And it's interesting that--

00:13:29.280 --> 00:13:31.400 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Tell us about
the connection with them.

00:13:31.400 --> 00:13:33.415 align:middle line:84%
Most people don't
know the background

00:13:33.415 --> 00:13:34.994 align:middle line:90%
to these two authors.

00:13:34.994 --> 00:13:36.910 align:middle line:84%
>>ICKE: There is a network
of secret societies

00:13:36.910 --> 00:13:40.140 align:middle line:90%
that operates behind the scenes.

00:13:40.140 --> 00:13:43.190 align:middle line:84%
And these secret
societies, for instance,

00:13:43.190 --> 00:13:46.410 align:middle line:84%
will have their operatives
in the Democrat Party

00:13:46.410 --> 00:13:48.510 align:middle line:84%
and they'll have
their operatives

00:13:48.510 --> 00:13:50.060 align:middle line:90%
in the Republican Party.

00:13:50.060 --> 00:13:52.960 align:middle line:84%
They'll have their operatives
at ownership and controlling

00:13:52.960 --> 00:13:54.840 align:middle line:84%
level in the
pharmaceutical cartel.

00:13:54.840 --> 00:13:58.310 align:middle line:84%
This is why there's this great
war on alternative medicine,

00:13:58.310 --> 00:13:59.860 align:middle line:90%
and organic food.

00:13:59.860 --> 00:14:01.360 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Trying
to ban supplements.

00:14:01.360 --> 00:14:02.290 align:middle line:90%
>>ICKE: Yeah.

00:14:02.290 --> 00:14:06.810 align:middle line:84%
When you connect the dots,
it's like, oh, it's so obvious.

00:14:06.810 --> 00:14:08.550 align:middle line:84%
But when you're going
boing, boing, boing

00:14:08.550 --> 00:14:13.380 align:middle line:84%
and won't let it in, it's
just a bewildering world

00:14:13.380 --> 00:14:14.650 align:middle line:90%
of different happenings.

00:14:14.650 --> 00:14:17.370 align:middle line:84%
Don't understand what's
going on, so I'll switch off.

00:14:17.370 --> 00:14:20.164 align:middle line:84%
What my mother used to say,
she used to say, oh, first

00:14:20.164 --> 00:14:21.580 align:middle line:84%
they tell you
sugar's bad for you.

00:14:21.580 --> 00:14:22.620 align:middle line:84%
Then they tell you
it's good for you.

00:14:22.620 --> 00:14:23.909 align:middle line:90%
I can't be doing with it.

00:14:23.909 --> 00:14:25.200 align:middle line:90%
And she'd switch off from both.

00:14:25.200 --> 00:14:26.491 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Which most people do.

00:14:26.491 --> 00:14:27.100 align:middle line:90%
>>ICKE: Yes.

00:14:27.100 --> 00:14:29.750 align:middle line:84%
And what we need to do is
to be mature enough not to,

00:14:29.750 --> 00:14:33.619 align:middle line:84%
and to look at it and see
what's really going on.

00:14:33.619 --> 00:14:36.160 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: By the way, I want to
mention something right here.

00:14:36.160 --> 00:14:38.160 align:middle line:84%
It's the perfect time,
too bad I didn't bring it

00:14:38.160 --> 00:14:39.460 align:middle line:90%
with me to England.

00:14:39.460 --> 00:14:41.660 align:middle line:84%
Life magazine,
about a month ago--

00:14:41.660 --> 00:14:44.160 align:middle line:84%
Life, mainstream
magazine, came out

00:14:44.160 --> 00:14:47.237 align:middle line:84%
with their special
secret society edition.

00:14:47.237 --> 00:14:49.320 align:middle line:84%
And so of course I snapped
it up and read through.

00:14:49.320 --> 00:14:51.760 align:middle line:84%
I thought, how is this
going to be treated?

00:14:51.760 --> 00:14:54.470 align:middle line:84%
And interestingly, there
were some things in there

00:14:54.470 --> 00:14:55.770 align:middle line:90%
that had truth in them.

00:14:55.770 --> 00:14:58.570 align:middle line:84%
Which is how partly
how this game works,

00:14:58.570 --> 00:15:01.910 align:middle line:84%
peppered with
truth, interspersed

00:15:01.910 --> 00:15:04.195 align:middle line:84%
with untruths and
limitation, right?

00:15:04.195 --> 00:15:06.070 align:middle line:84%
>>ICKE: I call it gin
and tonic with a twist.

00:15:06.070 --> 00:15:07.490 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Gin and
tonic with a twist.

00:15:07.490 --> 00:15:09.490 align:middle line:84%
Just to let you know,
that's out in the US right

00:15:09.490 --> 00:15:12.190 align:middle line:84%
now, in grocery stores,
secret societies issue.

00:15:12.190 --> 00:15:16.010 align:middle line:84%
>>ICKE: These secret societies,
in and of themselves,

00:15:16.010 --> 00:15:17.330 align:middle line:90%
are pyramids.

00:15:17.330 --> 00:15:20.490 align:middle line:84%
So people in the lower levels
of, say, the Freemasons

00:15:20.490 --> 00:15:22.710 align:middle line:84%
don't know what the
game is further up.

00:15:22.710 --> 00:15:25.390 align:middle line:84%
And these major
secret societies,

00:15:25.390 --> 00:15:27.860 align:middle line:84%
like the Freemasons,
the Knights Templar,

00:15:27.860 --> 00:15:32.470 align:middle line:84%
the Jesuits, and so
on, they feed people

00:15:32.470 --> 00:15:36.270 align:middle line:84%
through into an upper echelon
that connects them all.

00:15:36.270 --> 00:15:41.050 align:middle line:84%
Which is not even officially
accepted to exist.

00:15:41.050 --> 00:15:42.880 align:middle line:84%
And that's where
the real game is.

00:15:42.880 --> 00:15:46.780 align:middle line:84%
But what you have
is a situation where

00:15:46.780 --> 00:15:49.370 align:middle line:90%
there is a projected agenda.

00:15:49.370 --> 00:15:52.800 align:middle line:10%
And people will
find it difficult,

00:15:52.800 --> 00:15:57.690 align:middle line:10%
but it's projected not even
decades in advance but further.

00:15:57.690 --> 00:15:59.820 align:middle line:10%
Because there's another
force behind this

00:15:59.820 --> 00:16:02.210 align:middle line:10%
that we really need to open
our minds to eventually.

00:16:02.210 --> 00:16:06.100 align:middle line:10%
Which has far more
potential than what

00:16:06.100 --> 00:16:09.170 align:middle line:10%
we think is possible, again,
what we think is possible.

00:16:09.170 --> 00:16:11.610 align:middle line:84%
No, they can't be doing
that, boing, boing, boing--

00:16:11.610 --> 00:16:12.500 align:middle line:90%
but they are.

00:16:12.500 --> 00:16:14.690 align:middle line:90%
So there must be more to know.

00:16:14.690 --> 00:16:19.220 align:middle line:84%
And so if you get access to
the inner sanctums of some

00:16:19.220 --> 00:16:22.010 align:middle line:84%
of these most elite
secret societies,

00:16:22.010 --> 00:16:24.800 align:middle line:84%
you get access to
the projected agenda.

00:16:24.800 --> 00:16:29.650 align:middle line:84%
And what it means is, you
can write prophetic novels.

00:16:29.650 --> 00:16:31.280 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Back to
Orwell and Huxley.

00:16:31.280 --> 00:16:33.230 align:middle line:84%
>>ICKE: Back to
Orwell and Huxley,

00:16:33.230 --> 00:16:35.880 align:middle line:84%
which decades and decades
later after you've gone,

00:16:35.880 --> 00:16:38.450 align:middle line:84%
people are going,
this is happening.

00:16:38.450 --> 00:16:40.520 align:middle line:90%
It's amazing.

00:16:40.520 --> 00:16:44.767 align:middle line:84%
And it wasn't prophecy, and
it wasn't largely imagination.

00:16:44.767 --> 00:16:46.100 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Tell us their history.

00:16:46.100 --> 00:16:47.683 align:middle line:84%
>>ICKE: It was not
a projected agenda.

00:16:47.683 --> 00:16:52.660 align:middle line:84%
Because one of these
deeply involved secret

00:16:52.660 --> 00:16:54.160 align:middle line:90%
societies is based in London.

00:16:54.160 --> 00:16:56.070 align:middle line:90%
It's called the Fabian Society.

00:16:56.070 --> 00:16:59.350 align:middle line:84%
And interesting, it's named
after a Roman general called

00:16:59.350 --> 00:17:03.750 align:middle line:84%
Fabius, whose claim
to fame was never

00:17:03.750 --> 00:17:08.099 align:middle line:84%
to engage in battles
that could be decisive,

00:17:08.099 --> 00:17:09.210 align:middle line:90%
one way or the other.

00:17:09.210 --> 00:17:13.839 align:middle line:84%
His way was to weaken the enemy
over a long period of time

00:17:13.839 --> 00:17:16.280 align:middle line:84%
until they were so weak
that they could move in.

00:17:16.280 --> 00:17:18.920 align:middle line:84%
I've just described what's
been happening to humanity

00:17:18.920 --> 00:17:20.869 align:middle line:84%
throughout most of
known human history.

00:17:20.869 --> 00:17:25.329 align:middle line:84%
All this stuff now, with
the banking crashes,

00:17:25.329 --> 00:17:27.420 align:middle line:84%
I've shown in my
books in great detail

00:17:27.420 --> 00:17:30.764 align:middle line:84%
absolutely, coldly
calculated to happen.

00:17:30.764 --> 00:17:32.180 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Starting
many years ago.

00:17:32.180 --> 00:17:33.471 align:middle line:90%
You've been writing about this.

00:17:33.471 --> 00:17:34.610 align:middle line:90%
>>ICKE: Oh, long time ago.

00:17:34.610 --> 00:17:36.300 align:middle line:84%
You can pick it up
during Reagan-Bush.

00:17:36.300 --> 00:17:38.940 align:middle line:84%
You can pick it up whenever Alan
Greenspan, the Federal Reserve

00:17:38.940 --> 00:17:42.260 align:middle line:84%
Chairman of so
long gets involved.

00:17:42.260 --> 00:17:47.910 align:middle line:84%
And so then you look at
George Orwell, real name Eric

00:17:47.910 --> 00:17:50.320 align:middle line:84%
Blair, who wrote
"1984," and you look

00:17:50.320 --> 00:17:54.740 align:middle line:84%
at Aldous Huxley, a real big
insider who wrote "Brave New

00:17:54.740 --> 00:17:57.400 align:middle line:84%
World," and you say, are
there any connections?

00:17:57.400 --> 00:17:58.710 align:middle line:90%
Well, yes there are.

00:17:58.710 --> 00:18:02.130 align:middle line:84%
Because George Orwell
went to this elite school,

00:18:02.130 --> 00:18:08.270 align:middle line:84%
not too far from where
I am, called Eton.

00:18:08.270 --> 00:18:11.130 align:middle line:84%
And this is where the
royal children go,

00:18:11.130 --> 00:18:13.580 align:middle line:90%
and all this stuff.

00:18:13.580 --> 00:18:17.230 align:middle line:84%
And he went as Eric
Blair as a student there.

00:18:17.230 --> 00:18:20.995 align:middle line:84%
And his French teacher, at one
time, was called Aldous Huxley.

00:18:20.995 --> 00:18:24.990 align:middle line:84%
And Huxley introduced
Blair, Orwell

00:18:24.990 --> 00:18:27.640 align:middle line:84%
as we know him, to
the Fabian Society.

00:18:27.640 --> 00:18:30.200 align:middle line:84%
And that's where-- that
was an access point

00:18:30.200 --> 00:18:36.440 align:middle line:84%
into this inner underground
manipulation system which

00:18:36.440 --> 00:18:38.970 align:middle line:84%
allowed two novels
to be written.

00:18:38.970 --> 00:18:41.310 align:middle line:84%
"Brave New World"
was published in 1932

00:18:41.310 --> 00:18:44.880 align:middle line:84%
and "1984" was
published in 1948.

00:18:44.880 --> 00:18:48.345 align:middle line:84%
And this is how they
could be so accurate.

00:18:48.345 --> 00:18:49.720 align:middle line:84%
Because it's very
similar-- a lot

00:18:49.720 --> 00:18:53.000 align:middle line:84%
of my books in the mid '90s,
like "And the Truth Shall

00:18:53.000 --> 00:18:55.110 align:middle line:84%
Set You Free" are
proving to be incredibly

00:18:55.110 --> 00:18:57.870 align:middle line:90%
prophetic with modern events.

00:18:57.870 --> 00:18:59.060 align:middle line:90%
Why?

00:18:59.060 --> 00:19:00.630 align:middle line:90%
Because it's simple.

00:19:00.630 --> 00:19:05.650 align:middle line:84%
When there's a projected
agenda and you can research it,

00:19:05.650 --> 00:19:10.870 align:middle line:84%
get access to it, by whatever
means, then unless something

00:19:10.870 --> 00:19:14.020 align:middle line:84%
intervenes in that
projected agenda,

00:19:14.020 --> 00:19:17.420 align:middle line:84%
i.e., humanity wakes up and
says we're not having it,

00:19:17.420 --> 00:19:19.340 align:middle line:90%
then it's going to happen.

00:19:19.340 --> 00:19:20.320 align:middle line:90%
It's not prophecy.

00:19:20.320 --> 00:19:21.540 align:middle line:90%
It's look, this is the plan.

00:19:21.540 --> 00:19:23.910 align:middle line:84%
And if no one stops it,
this is what happens.

00:19:23.910 --> 00:19:27.340 align:middle line:84%
And this is what
I do in my books.

00:19:27.340 --> 00:19:29.899 align:middle line:84%
That's why people say,
how did you know that?

00:19:29.899 --> 00:19:31.940 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Because you're
aware of the general way

00:19:31.940 --> 00:19:33.600 align:middle line:90%
in which the system works.

00:19:33.600 --> 00:19:34.475 align:middle line:90%
>>ICKE: Yes, exactly.

00:19:34.475 --> 00:19:36.370 align:middle line:84%
And in terms of
Orwell and Huxley,

00:19:36.370 --> 00:19:37.540 align:middle line:90%
they got access that way.

00:19:37.540 --> 00:19:40.190 align:middle line:84%
It seems that
Huxley supported it.

00:19:40.190 --> 00:19:42.470 align:middle line:84%
Of course his brother
was a famous eugenicist,

00:19:42.470 --> 00:19:47.990 align:middle line:84%
Julian Huxley, first head
of UNESCO and also one

00:19:47.990 --> 00:19:52.100 align:middle line:84%
of the founders of what is now
the World Wide Fund for Nature,

00:19:52.100 --> 00:19:55.160 align:middle line:84%
Prince Phillip's--
it's global warming.

00:19:55.160 --> 00:19:57.640 align:middle line:84%
We must deindustrialize
and all this stuff.

00:19:57.640 --> 00:20:00.260 align:middle line:84%
You don't industrialize,
Prince Phillip, do you?

00:20:00.260 --> 00:20:00.939 align:middle line:90%
No.

00:20:00.939 --> 00:20:02.480 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: But David,
what about this?

00:20:02.480 --> 00:20:06.010 align:middle line:84%
What about the fact that those
two men wrote those two novels?

00:20:06.010 --> 00:20:09.150 align:middle line:90%
What do you put that down to?

00:20:09.150 --> 00:20:12.550 align:middle line:84%
I mean, in a way, were they
doing a service to humanity

00:20:12.550 --> 00:20:14.490 align:middle line:90%
to warn us of what was coming?

00:20:14.490 --> 00:20:17.430 align:middle line:84%
Or was it to perhaps
even program us

00:20:17.430 --> 00:20:19.189 align:middle line:90%
toward a potential reality?

00:20:19.189 --> 00:20:20.230 align:middle line:90%
How do you perceive that?

00:20:20.230 --> 00:20:23.610 align:middle line:84%
>>ICKE: Well, if we get we get
really, really, really deep,

00:20:23.610 --> 00:20:26.050 align:middle line:84%
I think predictive
programming as it's called,

00:20:26.050 --> 00:20:29.607 align:middle line:84%
i.e., we tell you
in movies and books

00:20:29.607 --> 00:20:30.690 align:middle line:90%
what we're planning to do.

00:20:30.690 --> 00:20:33.680 align:middle line:84%
I think it's very relevant to
the way we are being programmed

00:20:33.680 --> 00:20:36.290 align:middle line:90%
to actually manifest it.

00:20:36.290 --> 00:20:38.450 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: People
abhor those stories.

00:20:38.450 --> 00:20:39.400 align:middle line:90%
>>ICKE: Yeah,

00:20:39.400 --> 00:20:41.270 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: I mean, the
feeling part of us,

00:20:41.270 --> 00:20:43.510 align:middle line:84%
the intuitive part
of us, rejects

00:20:43.510 --> 00:20:45.720 align:middle line:90%
that reality at the same time.

00:20:45.720 --> 00:20:47.910 align:middle line:84%
>>ICKE: Well, I think,
going back to the question

00:20:47.910 --> 00:20:51.860 align:middle line:84%
before, I don't think Aldous
Huxley was writing "Brave New

00:20:51.860 --> 00:20:53.700 align:middle line:90%
World" to help humanity.

00:20:53.700 --> 00:20:56.729 align:middle line:84%
I think he was telling
us what was coming.

00:20:56.729 --> 00:20:58.270 align:middle line:84%
Because these people
are so arrogant,

00:20:58.270 --> 00:20:59.410 align:middle line:84%
they think nothing
could stop them.

00:20:59.410 --> 00:21:01.040 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: What
about George Orwell?

00:21:01.040 --> 00:21:02.830 align:middle line:84%
>>ICKE: I think George
Orwell, personally,

00:21:02.830 --> 00:21:05.820 align:middle line:90%
was trying to alert people.

00:21:05.820 --> 00:21:09.400 align:middle line:84%
He had got access to something
and didn't like it at all.

00:21:09.400 --> 00:21:12.270 align:middle line:84%
If you look at-- he
was very, very ill

00:21:12.270 --> 00:21:14.480 align:middle line:90%
when he was finishing the book.

00:21:14.480 --> 00:21:18.154 align:middle line:84%
He didn't live long
after he finished it.

00:21:18.154 --> 00:21:19.070 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Interesting.

00:21:19.070 --> 00:21:19.640 align:middle line:84%
So he was in some
internal conflict,

00:21:19.640 --> 00:21:19.850 align:middle line:90%
and pain and suffering.

00:21:19.850 --> 00:21:21.360 align:middle line:90%
>>ICKE: I think so.

00:21:21.360 --> 00:21:22.510 align:middle line:90%
I think so.

00:21:22.510 --> 00:21:25.390 align:middle line:84%
And interestingly, I
mean some people say

00:21:25.390 --> 00:21:27.650 align:middle line:84%
and they may well be
right, that it actually

00:21:27.650 --> 00:21:29.640 align:middle line:90%
is called "1984" as a code.

00:21:29.640 --> 00:21:32.950 align:middle line:84%
Because 1984 was the
100th anniversary

00:21:32.950 --> 00:21:36.070 align:middle line:84%
of the founding of
the Fabian Society.

00:21:36.070 --> 00:21:43.110 align:middle line:84%
In my last two books I quote a
guy called Dr. Richard Day, who

00:21:43.110 --> 00:21:43.750 align:middle line:90%
in 1969--

00:21:43.750 --> 00:21:45.040 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes, fascinating.

00:21:45.040 --> 00:21:47.840 align:middle line:84%
>>ICKE: He was head of Planned
Parenthood, which came out

00:21:47.840 --> 00:21:51.210 align:middle line:84%
the old eugenics movement,
people like Julian Huxley.

00:21:51.210 --> 00:21:53.414 align:middle line:84%
It all connects in the end
if you talk long enough.

00:21:53.414 --> 00:21:54.080 align:middle line:90%
Him again, yeah.

00:21:54.080 --> 00:21:56.870 align:middle line:90%


00:21:56.870 --> 00:22:00.270 align:middle line:84%
He-- no one seems to
know why he did this,

00:22:00.270 --> 00:22:05.640 align:middle line:84%
but he stood up at a meeting,
like a conference or an event--

00:22:05.640 --> 00:22:07.194 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Of MDs, was it?

00:22:07.194 --> 00:22:08.610 align:middle line:84%
>>ICKE: Yeah, it
was pediatricians

00:22:08.610 --> 00:22:10.950 align:middle line:84%
in Pittsburgh,
Pennsylvania, in 1969.

00:22:10.950 --> 00:22:12.610 align:middle line:84%
And before he spoke,
he asked everyone

00:22:12.610 --> 00:22:16.020 align:middle line:84%
to stop any recording equipment
and not to take notes.

00:22:16.020 --> 00:22:17.780 align:middle line:84%
Because he was
going to tell them

00:22:17.780 --> 00:22:19.356 align:middle line:84%
how the world was going to
change, according to a secret

00:22:19.356 --> 00:22:19.856 align:middle line:90%
plan.

00:22:19.856 --> 00:22:22.710 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: When I read that, I
thought, why would he do that?

00:22:22.710 --> 00:22:24.860 align:middle line:84%
>>ICKE: Well, some of
them are so arrogant.

00:22:24.860 --> 00:22:28.904 align:middle line:84%
I mean, basically, he said
as part of his remarks,

00:22:28.904 --> 00:22:29.820 align:middle line:90%
everything's in place.

00:22:29.820 --> 00:22:31.210 align:middle line:90%
Nothing can stop it.

00:22:31.210 --> 00:22:35.870 align:middle line:84%
But there was a doctor,
Dunagan, I think his name was,

00:22:35.870 --> 00:22:38.560 align:middle line:84%
who did take notes and
wrote them up afterwards

00:22:38.560 --> 00:22:39.680 align:middle line:90%
and kept them for years.

00:22:39.680 --> 00:22:43.120 align:middle line:84%
And eventually,
before Dunagan died,

00:22:43.120 --> 00:22:47.210 align:middle line:84%
he did a series of interviews,
I think about 2004,

00:22:47.210 --> 00:22:52.360 align:middle line:84%
when he said what this
guy had said in 1969.

00:22:52.360 --> 00:22:55.190 align:middle line:90%
And it's extraordinary.

00:22:55.190 --> 00:22:57.540 align:middle line:84%
I mean, the world
that we live in today,

00:22:57.540 --> 00:23:03.630 align:middle line:84%
he described in 1969 in great
detail, even down to the fact

00:23:03.630 --> 00:23:06.400 align:middle line:84%
that weather changing
technology will

00:23:06.400 --> 00:23:09.650 align:middle line:84%
be used to create
droughts and floods.

00:23:09.650 --> 00:23:13.660 align:middle line:84%
And he should know because
Richard Day was a weather

00:23:13.660 --> 00:23:17.837 align:middle line:84%
manipulator in the US army
during the Second World War.

00:23:17.837 --> 00:23:19.920 align:middle line:84%
That's how long they've
been manipulating weather.

00:23:19.920 --> 00:23:21.320 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Seeding
clouds and the like.

00:23:21.320 --> 00:23:21.970 align:middle line:84%
>>ICKE: Again, we're
in another one.

00:23:21.970 --> 00:23:23.802 align:middle line:84%
Boing, they can't
manipulate the weather.

00:23:23.802 --> 00:23:24.760 align:middle line:90%
Well, hold on a second.

00:23:24.760 --> 00:23:25.110 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Of course, that's
what cloud seeding is.

00:23:25.110 --> 00:23:28.510 align:middle line:84%
>>ICKE: There's a series
of United Nations treaties

00:23:28.510 --> 00:23:30.784 align:middle line:84%
where countries agree not
to manipulate the weather.

00:23:30.784 --> 00:23:32.450 align:middle line:84%
Why would they do
that if they couldn't?

00:23:32.450 --> 00:23:33.640 align:middle line:84%
I mean, the weather's
one of the most--

00:23:33.640 --> 00:23:35.473 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Actually,
it's old technology now.

00:23:35.473 --> 00:23:38.310 align:middle line:84%
>>ICKE: Oh, yeah,
absolutely it is.

00:23:38.310 --> 00:23:41.160 align:middle line:84%
And then you look at
the Frankfurt School,

00:23:41.160 --> 00:23:43.790 align:middle line:84%
as it was called,
came out of Frankfurt,

00:23:43.790 --> 00:23:46.050 align:middle line:90%
Germany in the 1930s.

00:23:46.050 --> 00:23:48.630 align:middle line:84%
And then it moved to
America, eventually settling

00:23:48.630 --> 00:23:49.670 align:middle line:90%
in California.

00:23:49.670 --> 00:23:54.250 align:middle line:84%
And it had a wish list
of socially engineering

00:23:54.250 --> 00:23:56.080 align:middle line:90%
human society.

00:23:56.080 --> 00:23:57.820 align:middle line:84%
And when you look
at that wishlist,

00:23:57.820 --> 00:24:01.690 align:middle line:84%
from all those decades ago,
it's human society today.

00:24:01.690 --> 00:24:05.370 align:middle line:84%
So if people want to go
into denial that this

00:24:05.370 --> 00:24:08.300 align:middle line:84%
is all some conspiracy
fantasy, well, they

00:24:08.300 --> 00:24:09.440 align:middle line:90%
should go into denial.

00:24:09.440 --> 00:24:11.490 align:middle line:90%
But they should know this, too.

00:24:11.490 --> 00:24:16.070 align:middle line:84%
That denial can seem
very nice for a while,

00:24:16.070 --> 00:24:17.980 align:middle line:84%
but if you stay in
denial for long enough,

00:24:17.980 --> 00:24:21.450 align:middle line:84%
denial one day knocks on your
door and asks for your papers.

00:24:21.450 --> 00:24:24.650 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And it puts you in a
state of internal incoherence.

00:24:24.650 --> 00:24:26.350 align:middle line:84%
>>ICKE: Denial is
one of the greatest

00:24:26.350 --> 00:24:28.550 align:middle line:90%
forms of human suppression.

00:24:28.550 --> 00:24:31.610 align:middle line:84%
Because a lot of it
is based on the fact

00:24:31.610 --> 00:24:39.090 align:middle line:84%
that I don't want to face the
fact that this is happening.

00:24:39.090 --> 00:24:41.970 align:middle line:84%
Because I would rather
it not be happening.

00:24:41.970 --> 00:24:45.320 align:middle line:84%
Therefore, what I'm going
to do is convince myself

00:24:45.320 --> 00:24:47.430 align:middle line:90%
that it's not happening.

00:24:47.430 --> 00:24:49.640 align:middle line:84%
Change the subject, don't
want to hear it, stop.

00:24:49.640 --> 00:24:51.730 align:middle line:84%
No, blah, blah blah,
make lots of noise.

00:24:51.730 --> 00:24:54.790 align:middle line:84%
No, no, don't want to
hear it, shut up, shut up.

00:24:54.790 --> 00:24:59.090 align:middle line:84%
And then denial goes,
boom, boom, boom.

00:24:59.090 --> 00:25:00.890 align:middle line:84%
Who could be at
this time of night?

00:25:00.890 --> 00:25:03.050 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Denial.

00:25:03.050 --> 00:25:05.490 align:middle line:84%
>>ICKE: Would you
come with us, sir?

00:25:05.490 --> 00:25:08.230 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And it does get
you, one way or another.

00:25:08.230 --> 00:25:11.150 align:middle line:84%
>>ICKE: Well, the thing
is, it's like the pastor.

00:25:11.150 --> 00:25:16.079 align:middle line:84%
The famous statement by the
pastor in Nazi Germany who

00:25:16.079 --> 00:25:18.370 align:middle line:84%
said, first they came for
the Jews and I was not a Jew,

00:25:18.370 --> 00:25:19.554 align:middle line:90%
so I did nothing.

00:25:19.554 --> 00:25:20.970 align:middle line:84%
Then they came for
the Communists,

00:25:20.970 --> 00:25:21.870 align:middle line:90%
and I was not a Communist.

00:25:21.870 --> 00:25:22.460 align:middle line:90%
So I did nothing.

00:25:22.460 --> 00:25:24.085 align:middle line:84%
Then they came for
the trade unionists.

00:25:24.085 --> 00:25:26.100 align:middle line:84%
I was not a trade
unionist, so I did nothing.

00:25:26.100 --> 00:25:28.130 align:middle line:84%
Then they came for me
and there was no one

00:25:28.130 --> 00:25:30.300 align:middle line:90%
left to speak out for me.

00:25:30.300 --> 00:25:33.590 align:middle line:84%
And what we're looking
at is different parts

00:25:33.590 --> 00:25:35.890 align:middle line:90%
of society being picked off.

00:25:35.890 --> 00:25:39.200 align:middle line:84%
Other parts of society
saying, it's not my problem.

00:25:39.200 --> 00:25:40.540 align:middle line:90%
I didn't agree with him anyway.

00:25:40.540 --> 00:25:42.630 align:middle line:84%
Oh, so freedom of expression
is only for people

00:25:42.630 --> 00:25:43.800 align:middle line:90%
you agree with, then, is it?

00:25:43.800 --> 00:25:44.920 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

00:25:44.920 --> 00:25:47.150 align:middle line:84%
And so, uh oh, it's
Muslim terrorists.

00:25:47.150 --> 00:25:49.060 align:middle line:84%
Well, what's
happening now, Regina?

00:25:49.060 --> 00:25:51.410 align:middle line:84%
Muslim terrorists are
seamlessly morphing

00:25:51.410 --> 00:25:54.670 align:middle line:84%
into domestic terrorists
so that we can then

00:25:54.670 --> 00:25:59.790 align:middle line:84%
have the ability to justify
impositions of the Orwellian

00:25:59.790 --> 00:26:03.350 align:middle line:84%
state upon domestic America,
and domestic Britain,

00:26:03.350 --> 00:26:06.850 align:middle line:84%
and domestic everywhere
else, on the basis

00:26:06.850 --> 00:26:09.340 align:middle line:90%
of protecting the people.

00:26:09.340 --> 00:26:12.310 align:middle line:84%
We have to take your freedoms
away to protect your freedom.

00:26:12.310 --> 00:26:15.310 align:middle line:84%
Newt Gingrich virtually
said that once, you know,

00:26:15.310 --> 00:26:16.730 align:middle line:84%
when he was
remembering or trying

00:26:16.730 --> 00:26:19.230 align:middle line:84%
to remember to breathe
at the time, I think.

00:26:19.230 --> 00:26:25.310 align:middle line:84%
But this is what we're
facing, this denial.

00:26:25.310 --> 00:26:29.860 align:middle line:84%
And yet there's 7 billion
people currently on planet Earth

00:26:29.860 --> 00:26:32.860 align:middle line:84%
being manipulated,
and being directed,

00:26:32.860 --> 00:26:34.860 align:middle line:90%
and being socially engineered.

00:26:34.860 --> 00:26:37.720 align:middle line:84%
And there is a tiny, at
the core of the core,

00:26:37.720 --> 00:26:42.330 align:middle line:84%
in full knowledge of it,
cabal-- a tiny number of people

00:26:42.330 --> 00:26:44.560 align:middle line:90%
who are actually doing it.

00:26:44.560 --> 00:26:48.100 align:middle line:84%
But what do you have
to do is, again,

00:26:48.100 --> 00:26:51.380 align:middle line:84%
divide and rule,
divided and rule.

00:26:51.380 --> 00:26:52.220 align:middle line:90%
I'm a Christian.

00:26:52.220 --> 00:26:53.680 align:middle line:90%
Oh, you're a Muslim.

00:26:53.680 --> 00:26:54.720 align:middle line:90%
Oh, you're a Jew.

00:26:54.720 --> 00:26:55.985 align:middle line:90%
Oh, you're a Republican.

00:26:55.985 --> 00:26:57.140 align:middle line:90%
Oh, you're a Democrat.

00:26:57.140 --> 00:26:58.760 align:middle line:84%
Divide and rule,
everywhere you can.

00:26:58.760 --> 00:27:02.110 align:middle line:90%


00:27:02.110 --> 00:27:06.540 align:middle line:84%
Not seeing injustice as
something in and of itself,

00:27:06.540 --> 00:27:07.660 align:middle line:90%
injustice.

00:27:07.660 --> 00:27:09.210 align:middle line:90%
Injustice, it's injustice.

00:27:09.210 --> 00:27:10.750 align:middle line:90%
OK, that's it, injustice.

00:27:10.750 --> 00:27:14.880 align:middle line:84%
So when injustice is happening
to someone I don't like,

00:27:14.880 --> 00:27:16.220 align:middle line:90%
it's injustice.

00:27:16.220 --> 00:27:18.520 align:middle line:90%
So I'm interested.

00:27:18.520 --> 00:27:21.930 align:middle line:84%
What we have is injustice
that affects me.

00:27:21.930 --> 00:27:23.242 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: That is true.

00:27:23.242 --> 00:27:24.700 align:middle line:84%
>>ICKE: Unfairness
that affects me.

00:27:24.700 --> 00:27:29.000 align:middle line:84%
This is a really
important area, because I

00:27:29.000 --> 00:27:33.720 align:middle line:84%
see people talking
about divide and rule,

00:27:33.720 --> 00:27:37.990 align:middle line:84%
fault lines of religion, and
class, and income bracket,

00:27:37.990 --> 00:27:39.620 align:middle line:90%
and politics.

00:27:39.620 --> 00:27:45.320 align:middle line:84%
But one of the greatest dividers
and rulers is me, me, me.

00:27:45.320 --> 00:27:46.700 align:middle line:90%
Divides us all.

00:27:46.700 --> 00:27:48.780 align:middle line:90%
What is in it for me?

00:27:48.780 --> 00:27:52.150 align:middle line:84%
What are the consequences
for me of this situation?

00:27:52.150 --> 00:27:56.410 align:middle line:84%
We would change
this world overnight

00:27:56.410 --> 00:27:59.160 align:middle line:84%
if we just started
making decisions

00:27:59.160 --> 00:28:04.280 align:middle line:84%
based on what was right,
and fair, and just,

00:28:04.280 --> 00:28:10.240 align:middle line:84%
in and of itself-- not
me, in and of itself.

00:28:10.240 --> 00:28:12.210 align:middle line:84%
Instead of what
happens overwhelmingly

00:28:12.210 --> 00:28:17.340 align:middle line:84%
now is we make a decision
based on what's in it for me

00:28:17.340 --> 00:28:19.020 align:middle line:90%
or what's best for me.

00:28:19.020 --> 00:28:22.520 align:middle line:84%
Me, me, me is one of the
greatest suppressing forces.

00:28:22.520 --> 00:28:26.630 align:middle line:10%
And this brings
me to another area

00:28:26.630 --> 00:28:30.830 align:middle line:10%
which I think will be
relevant to this show, really,

00:28:30.830 --> 00:28:37.410 align:middle line:10%
and that is people who
pick up this thing called

00:28:37.410 --> 00:28:39.850 align:middle line:10%
spirituality, which
is like, spirituality.

00:28:39.850 --> 00:28:41.460 align:middle line:84%
It's just such a
throw away line.

00:28:41.460 --> 00:28:42.540 align:middle line:90%
What does it mean?

00:28:42.540 --> 00:28:46.370 align:middle line:84%
It means different things
to different people.

00:28:46.370 --> 00:28:50.110 align:middle line:84%
Spirituality to some people
means religious wars.

00:28:50.110 --> 00:28:51.730 align:middle line:84%
To others it means
the lotus position.

00:28:51.730 --> 00:28:53.050 align:middle line:90%
I mean, it's different things.

00:28:53.050 --> 00:29:03.180 align:middle line:84%
But spirituality-- I see so
much of this whole area of quote

00:29:03.180 --> 00:29:10.470 align:middle line:84%
green, new age stuff as a
massive expression of denial.

00:29:10.470 --> 00:29:14.870 align:middle line:84%
It's like, I can
sit above it all.

00:29:14.870 --> 00:29:16.660 align:middle line:90%
Well, you can't.

00:29:16.660 --> 00:29:18.130 align:middle line:90%
Because that's denial.

00:29:18.130 --> 00:29:21.200 align:middle line:84%
And it's going to ask for
your papers, eventually.

00:29:21.200 --> 00:29:25.280 align:middle line:84%
I was in Hawaii and
I saw a lot of this

00:29:25.280 --> 00:29:29.690 align:middle line:84%
going on when I spoke
a few months ago.

00:29:29.690 --> 00:29:35.610 align:middle line:84%
And you know, there's this idea
that if you eat organic food,

00:29:35.610 --> 00:29:39.140 align:middle line:84%
and if you do yoga, and you
do all these other things,

00:29:39.140 --> 00:29:41.350 align:middle line:90%
somehow you are spiritual.

00:29:41.350 --> 00:29:43.800 align:middle line:90%
Somehow you're awake.

00:29:43.800 --> 00:29:49.120 align:middle line:84%
Well, for me, if you eat
organic food, and you do yoga,

00:29:49.120 --> 00:29:52.230 align:middle line:84%
and all this stuff--
your health is

00:29:52.230 --> 00:29:56.530 align:middle line:84%
going to be a lot better than
if you eat rubbish and don't

00:29:56.530 --> 00:29:58.030 align:middle line:90%
exercise.

00:29:58.030 --> 00:30:03.150 align:middle line:84%
But it's not going to make you
conscious in and of itself.

00:30:03.150 --> 00:30:08.544 align:middle line:84%
Because I've met so many
people around the world

00:30:08.544 --> 00:30:09.710 align:middle line:90%
who eat all the wrong stuff.

00:30:09.710 --> 00:30:11.350 align:middle line:84%
I'm not advocating
this for a second,

00:30:11.350 --> 00:30:13.380 align:middle line:90%
I'm using it as an example.

00:30:13.380 --> 00:30:14.900 align:middle line:90%
They eat all the wrong food.

00:30:14.900 --> 00:30:19.370 align:middle line:84%
They drink too much,
maybe even smoke too much.

00:30:19.370 --> 00:30:21.520 align:middle line:90%
But they're awake.

00:30:21.520 --> 00:30:24.810 align:middle line:10%
If you had a choice between
eating rubbish and abusing

00:30:24.810 --> 00:30:29.590 align:middle line:10%
your body and not, then
I'd make a choice not.

00:30:29.590 --> 00:30:32.920 align:middle line:10%
But what I'm saying
is, in and of itself,

00:30:32.920 --> 00:30:35.200 align:middle line:10%
it's not going to
make you conscious.

00:30:35.200 --> 00:30:37.480 align:middle line:10%
Because I have met people
doing all the wrong things

00:30:37.480 --> 00:30:40.000 align:middle line:10%
healthwise who were
being very conscious

00:30:40.000 --> 00:30:42.560 align:middle line:10%
in terms of their
expanded awareness.

00:30:42.560 --> 00:30:48.140 align:middle line:84%
And I've met people who do
everything right from a health

00:30:48.140 --> 00:30:52.150 align:middle line:84%
and food point of view
who are solid gold asleep.

00:30:52.150 --> 00:30:58.530 align:middle line:84%
Because niches and cul
de sacs of the mind

00:30:58.530 --> 00:31:00.890 align:middle line:90%
don't just take one expression.

00:31:00.890 --> 00:31:06.110 align:middle line:84%
And I've referred to this
whole new age arena in the past

00:31:06.110 --> 00:31:09.310 align:middle line:84%
as the last cul de sac
before the gold mine.

00:31:09.310 --> 00:31:13.340 align:middle line:84%
Because they are people,
to an extent, who

00:31:13.340 --> 00:31:16.110 align:middle line:84%
have rejected
conventional religion

00:31:16.110 --> 00:31:22.600 align:middle line:84%
and moved on to the fact that
this reality is a vibrational

00:31:22.600 --> 00:31:23.862 align:middle line:90%
construct.

00:31:23.862 --> 00:31:25.820 align:middle line:84%
It goes much deeper than
that, but on one level

00:31:25.820 --> 00:31:27.030 align:middle line:90%
that's what it is.

00:31:27.030 --> 00:31:28.890 align:middle line:84%
Everything's a vibration
and in the end,

00:31:28.890 --> 00:31:30.400 align:middle line:84%
nothing's solid
and all this stuff.

00:31:30.400 --> 00:31:32.980 align:middle line:84%
They all bring all the
quantum physics in.

00:31:32.980 --> 00:31:36.700 align:middle line:84%
But it's still in complete
denial of so many things

00:31:36.700 --> 00:31:38.180 align:middle line:90%
that they don't want to face.

00:31:38.180 --> 00:31:42.350 align:middle line:84%
And you know, there is a
belief system that-- I mean,

00:31:42.350 --> 00:31:44.015 align:middle line:90%
I've had it said to me so often.

00:31:44.015 --> 00:31:46.660 align:middle line:90%
Oh, my goodness, me.

00:31:46.660 --> 00:31:48.240 align:middle line:90%
You're negative.

00:31:48.240 --> 00:31:49.630 align:middle line:90%
You're frightening people.

00:31:49.630 --> 00:31:51.950 align:middle line:84%
And I'm thinking, are
you the same people

00:31:51.950 --> 00:31:54.330 align:middle line:84%
that say we have
to let go of fear?

00:31:54.330 --> 00:31:56.070 align:middle line:90%
So what are you frightened for?

00:31:56.070 --> 00:31:57.300 align:middle line:90%
Oh, it's negative.

00:31:57.300 --> 00:31:59.940 align:middle line:90%
I'll tell you something.

00:31:59.940 --> 00:32:03.130 align:middle line:90%
Knowledge is never negative.

00:32:03.130 --> 00:32:04.830 align:middle line:90%
Ignorance is negative.

00:32:04.830 --> 00:32:07.220 align:middle line:84%
Because that's how we
got into this mess.

00:32:07.220 --> 00:32:10.610 align:middle line:84%
And thus we have to open
our minds to all possibility

00:32:10.610 --> 00:32:14.840 align:middle line:84%
and not deny it because
we'd rather it not be true.

00:32:14.840 --> 00:32:20.451 align:middle line:84%
And you know, if people want
an example of what happens,

00:32:20.451 --> 00:32:24.730 align:middle line:84%
and what will happen if we
do not get a grip of this,

00:32:24.730 --> 00:32:27.590 align:middle line:84%
then look at Falung
Gong, in China.

00:32:27.590 --> 00:32:31.420 align:middle line:84%
They're people that do
meditation, all good stuff.

00:32:31.420 --> 00:32:32.970 align:middle line:90%
I'm not knocking any of it.

00:32:32.970 --> 00:32:36.590 align:middle line:84%
I'm saying, in and of
itself, there must be more.

00:32:36.590 --> 00:32:39.450 align:middle line:84%
And they got up to
about 17 million people

00:32:39.450 --> 00:32:44.940 align:middle line:84%
in China who were doing
these meditative, eating

00:32:44.940 --> 00:32:46.680 align:middle line:84%
the right food as
best they could,

00:32:46.680 --> 00:32:50.020 align:middle line:84%
all these things--
healing, hands on healing,

00:32:50.020 --> 00:32:51.740 align:middle line:90%
energy exchange healing.

00:32:51.740 --> 00:32:56.770 align:middle line:84%
And it got to the point where
the Chinese government thought,

00:32:56.770 --> 00:32:59.920 align:middle line:90%
this is a threat.

00:32:59.920 --> 00:33:02.680 align:middle line:84%
Because they want people
solid gold asleep because then

00:33:02.680 --> 00:33:03.596 align:middle line:90%
they can control them.

00:33:03.596 --> 00:33:06.520 align:middle line:90%
It's a piece of cake.

00:33:06.520 --> 00:33:09.510 align:middle line:84%
And the crack down
on them was horrific

00:33:09.510 --> 00:33:10.760 align:middle line:90%
and continues to be so.

00:33:10.760 --> 00:33:13.610 align:middle line:90%
I mean, unbelievably horrific.

00:33:13.610 --> 00:33:16.550 align:middle line:84%
And that's what is
planned for the West.

00:33:16.550 --> 00:33:19.590 align:middle line:84%
Once they feel they have
the confidence to go for it.

00:33:19.590 --> 00:33:22.030 align:middle line:84%
See, you reach a point,
Regina, where, OK.

00:33:22.030 --> 00:33:26.430 align:middle line:84%
We've prepared the
population, mind manipulated,

00:33:26.430 --> 00:33:29.390 align:middle line:84%
perception manipulated enough,
we can go for the Muslims.

00:33:29.390 --> 00:33:31.670 align:middle line:84%
We're confident
they'll accept that.

00:33:31.670 --> 00:33:34.109 align:middle line:90%
And then again, we're back.

00:33:34.109 --> 00:33:36.150 align:middle line:84%
First they came for the
Jews and I was not a Jew,

00:33:36.150 --> 00:33:36.858 align:middle line:90%
so I did nothing.

00:33:36.858 --> 00:33:40.110 align:middle line:84%
And then eventually,
if we go on,

00:33:40.110 --> 00:33:42.225 align:middle line:84%
only sitting in
the lotus position

00:33:42.225 --> 00:33:43.650 align:middle line:84%
there comes a
point where they're

00:33:43.650 --> 00:33:48.680 align:middle line:84%
going to be confident enough to
go for those people and ban it,

00:33:48.680 --> 00:33:50.470 align:middle line:84%
as it is in some
parts of the world.

00:33:50.470 --> 00:33:53.540 align:middle line:84%
And also what we're seeing
with his domestic terrorism

00:33:53.540 --> 00:33:56.400 align:middle line:84%
thing now coming in, oh, it's
domestic terrorism as well,

00:33:56.400 --> 00:33:59.110 align:middle line:84%
we need more
control-- is they're

00:33:59.110 --> 00:34:01.400 align:middle line:84%
starting to target
people like me and others

00:34:01.400 --> 00:34:04.360 align:middle line:84%
around the world
who are exposing

00:34:04.360 --> 00:34:07.970 align:middle line:84%
this conspiracy on
the basis of, it's

00:34:07.970 --> 00:34:09.677 align:middle line:84%
because these
people will go crazy

00:34:09.677 --> 00:34:11.510 align:middle line:84%
with guns who have
listened to these people.

00:34:11.510 --> 00:34:12.676 align:middle line:90%
That's why they're doing it.

00:34:12.676 --> 00:34:13.429 align:middle line:90%
We've got to ban.

00:34:13.429 --> 00:34:14.971 align:middle line:84%
And all this stuff,
and there you go.

00:34:14.971 --> 00:34:17.470 align:middle line:84%
Then they went for the trade
unionists and I was not a trade

00:34:17.470 --> 00:34:18.730 align:middle line:90%
unionist, and did nothing.

00:34:18.730 --> 00:34:21.300 align:middle line:90%
We have to come together.

00:34:21.300 --> 00:34:24.310 align:middle line:84%
We have to put down what
religion people believe in,

00:34:24.310 --> 00:34:26.920 align:middle line:84%
what background they
come from, how much money

00:34:26.920 --> 00:34:30.060 align:middle line:84%
they earn, what color
they are, where they live;

00:34:30.060 --> 00:34:33.699 align:middle line:84%
and we have to come
together as one united

00:34:33.699 --> 00:34:39.989 align:middle line:84%
people with a common
problem we need to sort out,

00:34:39.989 --> 00:34:43.800 align:middle line:84%
which is that the world is
being taken down a very dark,

00:34:43.800 --> 00:34:47.020 align:middle line:84%
a very dangerous, and
a nightmare world.

00:34:47.020 --> 00:34:50.260 align:middle line:84%
And if people think they don't
like what's happening today,

00:34:50.260 --> 00:34:55.870 align:middle line:84%
they should understand that
we are so far along this,

00:34:55.870 --> 00:34:56.699 align:middle line:90%
up to this point.

00:34:56.699 --> 00:34:59.440 align:middle line:84%
We're nowhere near where
they want to take it.

00:34:59.440 --> 00:35:03.209 align:middle line:84%
Now tell me that you're going to
look your children in the eyes,

00:35:03.209 --> 00:35:05.500 align:middle line:84%
and you're going to look your
grandchildren in the eyes

00:35:05.500 --> 00:35:08.820 align:middle line:84%
and say, I can stay in denial
about this and ignore it.

00:35:08.820 --> 00:35:11.800 align:middle line:84%
Because I don't want to accept
it's true, so I'm going to kid

00:35:11.800 --> 00:35:12.850 align:middle line:90%
myself it's not.

00:35:12.850 --> 00:35:14.610 align:middle line:84%
Look in their eyes
and tell them.

00:35:14.610 --> 00:35:17.410 align:middle line:84%
Because every time,
Regina, I tell you--

00:35:17.410 --> 00:35:21.252 align:middle line:84%
I look in the eyes, my
own grandkids, other kids

00:35:21.252 --> 00:35:21.960 align:middle line:90%
and young people.

00:35:21.960 --> 00:35:24.770 align:middle line:90%


00:35:24.770 --> 00:35:26.850 align:middle line:90%
It drives me on.

00:35:26.850 --> 00:35:29.490 align:middle line:84%
Because I know the world
that is planned for them

00:35:29.490 --> 00:35:30.920 align:middle line:90%
unless we sort it.

00:35:30.920 --> 00:35:32.160 align:middle line:90%
And we can.

00:35:32.160 --> 00:35:35.849 align:middle line:84%
But not when we're in denial
that anything needs sorting.

00:35:35.849 --> 00:35:38.390 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Can I validate, also,
part of what you said earlier

00:35:38.390 --> 00:35:39.910 align:middle line:84%
when you were
talking about Dr. Day

00:35:39.910 --> 00:35:42.040 align:middle line:84%
and what Dr. Day said when
they had all those MDs

00:35:42.040 --> 00:35:45.400 align:middle line:84%
turn off their-- not
take notes at that time?

00:35:45.400 --> 00:35:48.480 align:middle line:84%
There was another
document that's

00:35:48.480 --> 00:35:51.760 align:middle line:84%
a matter of public record, in
the US Congressional record.

00:35:51.760 --> 00:35:56.070 align:middle line:84%
And if I am not mistaken, I
think it was January 1964.

00:35:56.070 --> 00:35:58.480 align:middle line:84%
And what it was supposedly
from was someone

00:35:58.480 --> 00:36:01.660 align:middle line:84%
who had been sent to infiltrate
the communist agenda,

00:36:01.660 --> 00:36:02.750 align:middle line:90%
is what it was called.

00:36:02.750 --> 00:36:04.580 align:middle line:90%
So call it whatever you want.

00:36:04.580 --> 00:36:09.730 align:middle line:84%
The point is it had 47
different points on it that

00:36:09.730 --> 00:36:12.220 align:middle line:84%
were to be achieved
over the long haul.

00:36:12.220 --> 00:36:16.690 align:middle line:84%
And I bring this up because
the most disturbing ones to me

00:36:16.690 --> 00:36:18.480 align:middle line:84%
would not have maybe
even noticeable

00:36:18.480 --> 00:36:20.250 align:middle line:84%
or disturbing to
you, or someone else.

00:36:20.250 --> 00:36:21.730 align:middle line:90%
But to me it was.

00:36:21.730 --> 00:36:24.870 align:middle line:84%
And it wasn't only about
economic systems, the breakdown

00:36:24.870 --> 00:36:28.200 align:middle line:84%
and intentional breakdown
of family structure, that

00:36:28.200 --> 00:36:28.940 align:middle line:90%
was to occur.

00:36:28.940 --> 00:36:31.240 align:middle line:84%
>>ICKE: That was in the
Frankfurt school list, as well.

00:36:31.240 --> 00:36:32.840 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes, everything.

00:36:32.840 --> 00:36:34.160 align:middle line:90%
It all matches.

00:36:34.160 --> 00:36:39.410 align:middle line:84%
And the other one was to
promote, they maybe even used

00:36:39.410 --> 00:36:43.500 align:middle line:84%
the word ugliness, in public
art and to promote asymmetry.

00:36:43.500 --> 00:36:46.920 align:middle line:84%
And so you just look
at breakdown in family,

00:36:46.920 --> 00:36:49.500 align:middle line:84%
asymmetry being
promoted as beauty,

00:36:49.500 --> 00:36:52.300 align:middle line:84%
which disconnects a
person from themselves.

00:36:52.300 --> 00:36:54.040 align:middle line:84%
And I wanted to say
that because to me

00:36:54.040 --> 00:36:58.190 align:middle line:84%
what that-- and many other
points about the economy, about

00:36:58.190 --> 00:37:00.840 align:middle line:84%
sexual roles, and everything
are all delineated in there.

00:37:00.840 --> 00:37:03.400 align:middle line:84%
We are absolutely
living that reality

00:37:03.400 --> 00:37:06.680 align:middle line:84%
that was put forth in 1964
by that person in front

00:37:06.680 --> 00:37:10.000 align:middle line:84%
of the Congress and a
congressional committee then.

00:37:10.000 --> 00:37:12.510 align:middle line:84%
And the thing that it does,
just taking art alone,

00:37:12.510 --> 00:37:15.610 align:middle line:84%
if you take asymmetry and
say, this is now beautiful.

00:37:15.610 --> 00:37:17.220 align:middle line:84%
And all the art
critics say, wow, what

00:37:17.220 --> 00:37:20.010 align:middle line:84%
a lovely, inventive,
imaginative piece of art.

00:37:20.010 --> 00:37:23.790 align:middle line:84%
And your being is going,
I can't even look at it.

00:37:23.790 --> 00:37:26.410 align:middle line:84%
Looks to me like someone just
threw something at a canvas

00:37:26.410 --> 00:37:27.702 align:middle line:90%
and it went down the wrong way.

00:37:27.702 --> 00:37:29.368 align:middle line:84%
>>ICKE: This is such
and important area.

00:37:29.368 --> 00:37:31.060 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: You now
feel, you feel stupid.

00:37:31.060 --> 00:37:33.920 align:middle line:84%
You feel out of sync
with the experts.

00:37:33.920 --> 00:37:37.010 align:middle line:84%
You feel as though you're not
cultured and well educated

00:37:37.010 --> 00:37:39.970 align:middle line:84%
because you have this
opposing opinion which is, ew,

00:37:39.970 --> 00:37:41.420 align:middle line:84%
it makes me sick
to look at that.

00:37:41.420 --> 00:37:43.810 align:middle line:84%
And you can speak up,
because oh, everyone else is.

00:37:43.810 --> 00:37:46.842 align:middle line:84%
And just looking at
it that way, there

00:37:46.842 --> 00:37:48.800 align:middle line:84%
is this disconnect from
trusting our instincts.

00:37:48.800 --> 00:37:51.310 align:middle line:84%
>>ICKE: Very important
area, very important area.

00:37:51.310 --> 00:37:54.186 align:middle line:90%
First thing, it's not you.

00:37:54.186 --> 00:37:55.310 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: No, it's not you.

00:37:55.310 --> 00:37:57.580 align:middle line:90%
>>ICKE: The world is insane.

00:37:57.580 --> 00:38:00.080 align:middle line:90%
It's run by insane people.

00:38:00.080 --> 00:38:02.850 align:middle line:90%
It ain't you that's insane.

00:38:02.850 --> 00:38:04.150 align:middle line:90%
It's the world.

00:38:04.150 --> 00:38:07.200 align:middle line:84%
And if the world
sees you as sane,

00:38:07.200 --> 00:38:10.290 align:middle line:84%
just remember the
world is insane, right?

00:38:10.290 --> 00:38:11.610 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Don't try to fit.

00:38:11.610 --> 00:38:13.068 align:middle line:84%
>>ICKE: And that's
the other thing.

00:38:13.068 --> 00:38:14.950 align:middle line:84%
How many people on
the planet feel,

00:38:14.950 --> 00:38:17.240 align:middle line:84%
I just feel like, I feel
like I don't belong here.

00:38:17.240 --> 00:38:20.010 align:middle line:10%
Like I'm uncomfortable, like
I'm really not part of this--

00:38:20.010 --> 00:38:22.490 align:middle line:10%
almost everybody feels like
they're not part of something.

00:38:22.490 --> 00:38:23.260 align:middle line:10%
>>ICKE: Yes.

00:38:23.260 --> 00:38:24.830 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Why is that?

00:38:24.830 --> 00:38:26.820 align:middle line:84%
>>ICKE: A number of things
come into this area.

00:38:26.820 --> 00:38:28.470 align:middle line:84%
It's a very, very
important area.

00:38:28.470 --> 00:38:32.910 align:middle line:84%
And fundamental to what's
happened and the way out of it.

00:38:32.910 --> 00:38:35.780 align:middle line:84%
There was-- a
document came to light

00:38:35.780 --> 00:38:39.730 align:middle line:84%
in the late 1970s originally
and then again in the '80s,

00:38:39.730 --> 00:38:43.490 align:middle line:84%
or no, I think it
was dated 1979,

00:38:43.490 --> 00:38:45.050 align:middle line:90%
came to light in the '80s.

00:38:45.050 --> 00:38:47.380 align:middle line:84%
It was called "Quiet
Weapons for Quiet Wars."

00:38:47.380 --> 00:38:52.630 align:middle line:84%
And it was about socially
engineering people in society

00:38:52.630 --> 00:38:55.650 align:middle line:84%
in ways that they couldn't--
it actually says in it,

00:38:55.650 --> 00:38:58.376 align:middle line:84%
people instinctively feel
that something's not right.

00:38:58.376 --> 00:38:59.250 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Absolutely.

00:38:59.250 --> 00:39:01.900 align:middle line:84%
>>ICKE: But because of the
nature of the silent weapon,

00:39:01.900 --> 00:39:07.050 align:middle line:84%
i.e., social
engineering, they can't

00:39:07.050 --> 00:39:09.480 align:middle line:90%
grasp what's actually happening.

00:39:09.480 --> 00:39:12.876 align:middle line:84%
And another thing it said, very
interesting and appropriate--

00:39:12.876 --> 00:39:15.000 align:middle line:84%
there's a lot of stuff in
it about the money system

00:39:15.000 --> 00:39:17.630 align:middle line:84%
and how it's actually
electrical system.

00:39:17.630 --> 00:39:26.480 align:middle line:84%
It was that people, once
you push them, people then

00:39:26.480 --> 00:39:27.750 align:middle line:90%
encompass that.

00:39:27.750 --> 00:39:29.510 align:middle line:90%
And that becomes the new norm.

00:39:29.510 --> 00:39:31.029 align:middle line:90%
Then you push them some more.

00:39:31.029 --> 00:39:32.570 align:middle line:84%
And eventually
they'll integrate that

00:39:32.570 --> 00:39:33.986 align:middle line:84%
and that will
become the new norm.

00:39:33.986 --> 00:39:37.660 align:middle line:84%
So we have a situation now
where many young people,

00:39:37.660 --> 00:39:40.700 align:middle line:84%
their new norm, because
that's all they know

00:39:40.700 --> 00:39:43.330 align:middle line:84%
is that there's security
cameras in their school

00:39:43.330 --> 00:39:45.470 align:middle line:84%
and fingerprinting to
get a library book out.

00:39:45.470 --> 00:39:48.420 align:middle line:84%
And then that
programs and prepares

00:39:48.420 --> 00:39:51.130 align:middle line:84%
them to accept it in
society as a norm.

00:39:51.130 --> 00:39:53.920 align:middle line:84%
But that-- this whole area,
Regina, is so important.

00:39:53.920 --> 00:39:58.110 align:middle line:84%
Because this is what I've
been saying for years.

00:39:58.110 --> 00:40:05.390 align:middle line:84%
That we really can't understand
what's happening in the world

00:40:05.390 --> 00:40:08.780 align:middle line:84%
until we have some understanding
of what the world is.

00:40:08.780 --> 00:40:11.965 align:middle line:84%
This-- world, we
think is so physical.

00:40:11.965 --> 00:40:15.520 align:middle line:84%
Well, quantum physics
has shown that it's not.

00:40:15.520 --> 00:40:17.770 align:middle line:90%
It's holographic illusion.

00:40:17.770 --> 00:40:21.480 align:middle line:84%
It's like a holographic
movie, which

00:40:21.480 --> 00:40:23.440 align:middle line:84%
reasons I go into
in my books, in ways

00:40:23.440 --> 00:40:29.830 align:middle line:84%
we are decoding from the base
foundation of this reality,

00:40:29.830 --> 00:40:34.580 align:middle line:84%
which is wave form
information construct.

00:40:34.580 --> 00:40:36.710 align:middle line:84%
And if you just take the
ears-- a simple example,

00:40:36.710 --> 00:40:38.680 align:middle line:84%
but all the senses
do this-- the ears

00:40:38.680 --> 00:40:40.970 align:middle line:90%
take vibrational information.

00:40:40.970 --> 00:40:44.250 align:middle line:84%
See, when I'm
talking to you now,

00:40:44.250 --> 00:40:47.110 align:middle line:84%
I am creating words through
vibrational information.

00:40:47.110 --> 00:40:50.290 align:middle line:84%
It's all vibrational
information.

00:40:50.290 --> 00:40:54.710 align:middle line:84%
And as it passes to you, there's
nothing but vibrating energy.

00:40:54.710 --> 00:40:56.740 align:middle line:90%
There's no words.

00:40:56.740 --> 00:40:58.890 align:middle line:90%
But then it hits your ear.

00:40:58.890 --> 00:41:01.790 align:middle line:84%
Your ear turns it into
electrical information,

00:41:01.790 --> 00:41:04.450 align:middle line:84%
same information,
and communicates it

00:41:04.450 --> 00:41:07.750 align:middle line:84%
to the brain which then
decodes it into-- he's just

00:41:07.750 --> 00:41:10.130 align:middle line:90%
said, decodes it into.

00:41:10.130 --> 00:41:11.550 align:middle line:90%
And this is what's happening.

00:41:11.550 --> 00:41:15.630 align:middle line:84%
But this vibrational thing is
happening in all the senses.

00:41:15.630 --> 00:41:20.190 align:middle line:84%
So basically, the foundation
is the wave form level.

00:41:20.190 --> 00:41:23.970 align:middle line:84%
And if you go beyond this the
so-called illusory physical,

00:41:23.970 --> 00:41:27.060 align:middle line:84%
the holographic, you see it with
Kirlian photography and stuff

00:41:27.060 --> 00:41:30.020 align:middle line:84%
like that, you can see
the human auric field.

00:41:30.020 --> 00:41:33.110 align:middle line:84%
On one level, it's an
electromagnetic field.

00:41:33.110 --> 00:41:34.830 align:middle line:90%
It is awareness.

00:41:34.830 --> 00:41:37.150 align:middle line:84%
And as our emotions and
our thoughts change,

00:41:37.150 --> 00:41:41.340 align:middle line:84%
so the vibrations generated
change, so the colors change,

00:41:41.340 --> 00:41:44.030 align:middle line:84%
which are different expressions
of different vibrational

00:41:44.030 --> 00:41:45.130 align:middle line:90%
states.

00:41:45.130 --> 00:41:50.130 align:middle line:84%
Now, when you go into
a state of true harmony

00:41:50.130 --> 00:41:58.510 align:middle line:84%
where you are at peace,
multi-level peace,

00:41:58.510 --> 00:42:02.540 align:middle line:84%
then you can access higher
levels of awareness.

00:42:02.540 --> 00:42:07.620 align:middle line:84%
Because you are connecting
with their frequency as

00:42:07.620 --> 00:42:14.030 align:middle line:84%
you get deeper and deeper and
more harmonious with them.

00:42:14.030 --> 00:42:16.850 align:middle line:84%
So now you've got
expanded awareness.

00:42:16.850 --> 00:42:20.340 align:middle line:84%
And suddenly-- why is it when
people are having meditations,

00:42:20.340 --> 00:42:22.240 align:middle line:90%
they get insight?

00:42:22.240 --> 00:42:22.740 align:middle line:90%
Why?

00:42:22.740 --> 00:42:27.230 align:middle line:84%
Because you're accessing a
greater level of yourself.

00:42:27.230 --> 00:42:30.365 align:middle line:90%
OK, now-- oh, my goodness, me.

00:42:30.365 --> 00:42:35.390 align:middle line:84%
Am I going to make the rent
this week, what about--

00:42:35.390 --> 00:42:37.980 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Incoherence,
everything shuts down.

00:42:37.980 --> 00:42:38.980 align:middle line:90%
>>ICKE: Oh, my goodness.

00:42:38.980 --> 00:42:40.414 align:middle line:90%
What about the kids?

00:42:40.414 --> 00:42:41.330 align:middle line:90%
What about the future?

00:42:41.330 --> 00:42:42.205 align:middle line:90%
What are we going to?

00:42:42.205 --> 00:42:45.140 align:middle line:84%
I mean, we haven't payed
the mortgage for two months.

00:42:45.140 --> 00:42:48.920 align:middle line:84%
Is that going to
go into an expanded

00:42:48.920 --> 00:42:50.284 align:middle line:90%
state of consciousness?

00:42:50.284 --> 00:42:51.700 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: No, fear
is contractive.

00:42:51.700 --> 00:42:54.400 align:middle line:84%
>>ICKE: Is even going
through the motions of it

00:42:54.400 --> 00:42:57.580 align:middle line:84%
while having a limited sense
of the possible-- boing,

00:42:57.580 --> 00:43:00.220 align:middle line:84%
boing, boing-- gonna
really take you in there?

00:43:00.220 --> 00:43:01.210 align:middle line:90%
No.

00:43:01.210 --> 00:43:06.250 align:middle line:84%
And so what we have
is a situation where,

00:43:06.250 --> 00:43:12.390 align:middle line:84%
once upon a time, we
were a heart society.

00:43:12.390 --> 00:43:18.450 align:middle line:84%
We have these chakra
vortexes, the major one,

00:43:18.450 --> 00:43:21.550 align:middle line:90%
the balance one is the heart.

00:43:21.550 --> 00:43:25.900 align:middle line:84%
This is why there's so many
people with incoherent heart

00:43:25.900 --> 00:43:26.760 align:middle line:90%
energy.

00:43:26.760 --> 00:43:28.620 align:middle line:84%
This is why heart
attacks and heart disease

00:43:28.620 --> 00:43:30.380 align:middle line:84%
is one of the greatest
killers, because

00:43:30.380 --> 00:43:32.120 align:middle line:84%
the energetic
distortion is passed

00:43:32.120 --> 00:43:35.380 align:middle line:84%
on to the holographic
distortion, heart problems.

00:43:35.380 --> 00:43:40.170 align:middle line:84%
And in so many ways, Regina,
the "Avatar" movie for me

00:43:40.170 --> 00:43:43.010 align:middle line:84%
symbolized humanity
as it once was.

00:43:43.010 --> 00:43:44.720 align:middle line:90%
It was a heart society.

00:43:44.720 --> 00:43:49.740 align:middle line:84%
And heart societies connect
into other expression

00:43:49.740 --> 00:43:53.580 align:middle line:84%
of the infinite whole, called
animals and plants, and trees.

00:43:53.580 --> 00:43:59.070 align:middle line:84%
And you can communicate on
this energetic wave form level.

00:43:59.070 --> 00:44:02.830 align:middle line:84%
You see, you can't
talk to plants.

00:44:02.830 --> 00:44:04.950 align:middle line:90%
They don't know English.

00:44:04.950 --> 00:44:06.100 align:middle line:90%
Well, hold a second.

00:44:06.100 --> 00:44:07.579 align:middle line:90%
I'm vibrating information.

00:44:07.579 --> 00:44:09.370 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And those
studies have been done.

00:44:09.370 --> 00:44:10.328 align:middle line:90%
You can talk to plants.

00:44:10.328 --> 00:44:11.420 align:middle line:90%
And they do respond.

00:44:11.420 --> 00:44:15.690 align:middle line:84%
>>ICKE: A human will decode
that information as words.

00:44:15.690 --> 00:44:18.300 align:middle line:84%
A plant will decode
that information

00:44:18.300 --> 00:44:21.950 align:middle line:84%
as a feeling of what that
vibration represents.

00:44:21.950 --> 00:44:24.190 align:middle line:90%
So we were a heart society.

00:44:24.190 --> 00:44:28.380 align:middle line:84%
What do people say, never
mind what your head tells you.

00:44:28.380 --> 00:44:30.060 align:middle line:90%
What does your heart tell you?

00:44:30.060 --> 00:44:33.557 align:middle line:84%
Because the heart
makes the brain

00:44:33.557 --> 00:44:34.640 align:middle line:90%
look like a village idiot.

00:44:34.640 --> 00:44:35.800 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: It does.

00:44:35.800 --> 00:44:37.554 align:middle line:84%
>>ICKE: In terms of
its connection to

00:44:37.554 --> 00:44:38.845 align:middle line:90%
higher states of consciousness.

00:44:38.845 --> 00:44:40.120 align:middle line:90%
Here's what they've done.

00:44:40.120 --> 00:44:42.780 align:middle line:90%
They've made the brain the king.

00:44:42.780 --> 00:44:45.130 align:middle line:84%
This is why the
intellect is king.

00:44:45.130 --> 00:44:47.280 align:middle line:84%
So some of the most stupid
people I've ever met

00:44:47.280 --> 00:44:49.300 align:middle line:84%
have been advanced
intellectuals.

00:44:49.300 --> 00:44:56.780 align:middle line:84%
Because they believe they
are intelligent and aware

00:44:56.780 --> 00:44:59.390 align:middle line:84%
when they're just
stuck in the mind.

00:44:59.390 --> 00:45:01.120 align:middle line:90%
They're stuck in the brain.

00:45:01.120 --> 00:45:04.540 align:middle line:84%
And this organization,
in America, the HeartMath

00:45:04.540 --> 00:45:08.140 align:middle line:84%
Institute, has done so
many wonderful studies.

00:45:08.140 --> 00:45:11.770 align:middle line:84%
And one of them is that the
electromagnetic field, which

00:45:11.770 --> 00:45:14.370 align:middle line:84%
is the heart, the
heart energetic field,

00:45:14.370 --> 00:45:19.930 align:middle line:84%
is the most powerful in the
body, and emotions like love,

00:45:19.930 --> 00:45:24.230 align:middle line:84%
and appreciation, and caring
are thousands of times more

00:45:24.230 --> 00:45:29.010 align:middle line:84%
powerful in their affect
than hatred and manipulation.

00:45:29.010 --> 00:45:33.820 align:middle line:84%
And that when the heart is
in electromagnetic resonant

00:45:33.820 --> 00:45:38.840 align:middle line:84%
coherence, balance,
with the brain

00:45:38.840 --> 00:45:40.970 align:middle line:84%
and with the central
nervous system,

00:45:40.970 --> 00:45:43.530 align:middle line:84%
that connection
takes people into

00:45:43.530 --> 00:45:47.800 align:middle line:84%
a whole great expanded
level of awareness.

00:45:47.800 --> 00:45:50.330 align:middle line:84%
If you are a few
and you're trying

00:45:50.330 --> 00:45:53.380 align:middle line:84%
to control billions of
people, the last place

00:45:53.380 --> 00:45:57.420 align:middle line:84%
you want them is in
expanded state of awareness.

00:45:57.420 --> 00:46:00.680 align:middle line:90%
So they target the heart.

00:46:00.680 --> 00:46:05.520 align:middle line:84%
Because they know-- what
people know in the public arena

00:46:05.520 --> 00:46:09.950 align:middle line:84%
is nothing compared to what they
know in the secret projects.

00:46:09.950 --> 00:46:15.220 align:middle line:84%
They target the heart through
worry, through anxiety,

00:46:15.220 --> 00:46:19.790 align:middle line:84%
through hatred, through
division, through conflict.

00:46:19.790 --> 00:46:21.900 align:middle line:84%
And the electromagnetic
field of the heart

00:46:21.900 --> 00:46:24.150 align:middle line:90%
goes into incoherence.

00:46:24.150 --> 00:46:28.220 align:middle line:84%
Now that expanded
state of consciousness

00:46:28.220 --> 00:46:31.560 align:middle line:84%
is no longer there
and this becomes

00:46:31.560 --> 00:46:33.290 align:middle line:90%
the governor of perception.

00:46:33.290 --> 00:46:35.020 align:middle line:90%
And this is so easy to program.

00:46:35.020 --> 00:46:37.460 align:middle line:84%
This is why when
people are going

00:46:37.460 --> 00:46:41.420 align:middle line:84%
to their true self,
their intuitive level,

00:46:41.420 --> 00:46:43.880 align:middle line:90%
they don't say, I just know.

00:46:43.880 --> 00:46:45.010 align:middle line:90%
I just feel.

00:46:45.010 --> 00:46:47.747 align:middle line:90%
They go, I just know.

00:46:47.747 --> 00:46:49.080 align:middle line:90%
I just know I've got to do this.

00:46:49.080 --> 00:46:51.480 align:middle line:90%
They say, I think, I think.

00:46:51.480 --> 00:46:54.240 align:middle line:84%
Thinking is a very, very
low level of perception.

00:46:54.240 --> 00:46:58.550 align:middle line:84%
Knowing is the true
level of perception.

00:46:58.550 --> 00:47:00.980 align:middle line:84%
Not having to work it out,
but knowing because you

00:47:00.980 --> 00:47:03.730 align:middle line:84%
are accessing that
level which knows.

00:47:03.730 --> 00:47:10.800 align:middle line:84%
And so what they had to do
to manipulate us, this force,

00:47:10.800 --> 00:47:13.540 align:middle line:84%
was to move us
from being a heart

00:47:13.540 --> 00:47:16.730 align:middle line:84%
society to being
a belly society.

00:47:16.730 --> 00:47:19.560 align:middle line:84%
And to move the point
that we interact

00:47:19.560 --> 00:47:25.030 align:middle line:84%
with this reality from
the heart to the belly.

00:47:25.030 --> 00:47:26.490 align:middle line:90%
And what do we often hear now?

00:47:26.490 --> 00:47:28.682 align:middle line:84%
Not what does your
heart tell you.

00:47:28.682 --> 00:47:31.390 align:middle line:90%
No, what does your gut tell you.

00:47:31.390 --> 00:47:35.390 align:middle line:84%
And where do we interact
with society overwhelmingly?

00:47:35.390 --> 00:47:36.690 align:middle line:90%
Through the emotions.

00:47:36.690 --> 00:47:38.750 align:middle line:84%
What's the seat of the
emotions energetically--

00:47:38.750 --> 00:47:40.708 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Absolutely,
the gut, your intestines.

00:47:40.708 --> 00:47:42.850 align:middle line:90%
>>ICKE: It's the belly.

00:47:42.850 --> 00:47:45.520 align:middle line:84%
And this is when we get
emotionally frightened, we

00:47:45.520 --> 00:47:48.270 align:middle line:84%
go to the toilet a lot,
because the energetic level

00:47:48.270 --> 00:47:52.410 align:middle line:84%
of that vortex passes itself
onto the holographic level,

00:47:52.410 --> 00:47:56.320 align:middle line:84%
the intestine and
colon, et cetera.

00:47:56.320 --> 00:48:00.050 align:middle line:90%
And they want to hold us there.

00:48:00.050 --> 00:48:03.830 align:middle line:84%
And when you're coming
from a state of emotion

00:48:03.830 --> 00:48:06.170 align:middle line:84%
in terms of your
response to things,

00:48:06.170 --> 00:48:07.220 align:middle line:90%
that's what you're doing.

00:48:07.220 --> 00:48:07.969 align:middle line:90%
You're responding.

00:48:07.969 --> 00:48:09.090 align:middle line:90%
You're reacting.

00:48:09.090 --> 00:48:12.550 align:middle line:84%
We don't have a
society, overwhelmingly,

00:48:12.550 --> 00:48:16.070 align:middle line:84%
that thinks things
through or knows.

00:48:16.070 --> 00:48:20.590 align:middle line:84%
We're emotionally responding
and reacting to stimulus.

00:48:20.590 --> 00:48:23.670 align:middle line:84%
This is where war, conflict,
division, divide and rule

00:48:23.670 --> 00:48:24.520 align:middle line:90%
comes from.

00:48:24.520 --> 00:48:27.280 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: But this also is a
very addictive pattern for us.

00:48:27.280 --> 00:48:28.992 align:middle line:84%
You and I were both
in the news industry

00:48:28.992 --> 00:48:29.950 align:middle line:90%
at about the same time.

00:48:29.950 --> 00:48:31.270 align:middle line:90%
You were anchoring sports.

00:48:31.270 --> 00:48:32.230 align:middle line:90%
I was anchoring sports.

00:48:32.230 --> 00:48:34.521 align:middle line:84%
We were both doing it at the
same time on a show called

00:48:34.521 --> 00:48:36.880 align:middle line:84%
"Grandstand,"
actually, years ago.

00:48:36.880 --> 00:48:39.180 align:middle line:84%
And then I went on and did
news and you did your thing

00:48:39.180 --> 00:48:43.010 align:middle line:84%
with the Green Party and
all, for that bit of time.

00:48:43.010 --> 00:48:46.500 align:middle line:84%
But the reality was
that you couldn't really

00:48:46.500 --> 00:48:48.170 align:middle line:90%
escape that matrix.

00:48:48.170 --> 00:48:52.400 align:middle line:84%
As a news reader, or news
anchor in America as we call it,

00:48:52.400 --> 00:48:54.420 align:middle line:84%
I couldn't escape
that matrix of what

00:48:54.420 --> 00:48:56.270 align:middle line:84%
was being perpetuated
to the public, which

00:48:56.270 --> 00:48:59.220 align:middle line:84%
was almost exclusively
negative news.

00:48:59.220 --> 00:49:02.380 align:middle line:84%
We actually started
a good news program.

00:49:02.380 --> 00:49:04.570 align:middle line:84%
We decided, let's try
an experiment with this.

00:49:04.570 --> 00:49:07.320 align:middle line:84%
It was an independent
station before Fox got it.

00:49:07.320 --> 00:49:12.220 align:middle line:84%
And we decided to a noonday show
that had positive spins on it.

00:49:12.220 --> 00:49:16.180 align:middle line:84%
We'd do positive stories
sprinkled throughout.

00:49:16.180 --> 00:49:17.354 align:middle line:90%
It didn't last.

00:49:17.354 --> 00:49:18.770 align:middle line:84%
>>ICKE: There's a
reason for that.

00:49:18.770 --> 00:49:19.760 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:49:19.760 --> 00:49:23.760 align:middle line:84%
People are-- and the
viewers made that decision.

00:49:23.760 --> 00:49:24.780 align:middle line:90%
It did not last.

00:49:24.780 --> 00:49:26.420 align:middle line:84%
We were back to
the negative junk.

00:49:26.420 --> 00:49:27.836 align:middle line:84%
>>ICKE: There's a
reason for that.

00:49:27.836 --> 00:49:32.920 align:middle line:84%
And one of them is that the
receptors in the cells that

00:49:32.920 --> 00:49:38.070 align:middle line:84%
receive things like cocaine
are the same receptors that

00:49:38.070 --> 00:49:45.280 align:middle line:84%
receive the chemicals that are
generated by states of emotion.

00:49:45.280 --> 00:49:47.970 align:middle line:84%
Because when we have
an emotional state,

00:49:47.970 --> 00:49:49.720 align:middle line:84%
we're having a
vibrational state.

00:49:49.720 --> 00:49:51.040 align:middle line:90%
It's an information state.

00:49:51.040 --> 00:49:54.390 align:middle line:84%
We are creating a
state of information

00:49:54.390 --> 00:49:56.440 align:middle line:90%
by our emotional state.

00:49:56.440 --> 00:50:02.030 align:middle line:84%
And this becomes the
holographic state.

00:50:02.030 --> 00:50:05.870 align:middle line:84%
And in that state,
that distortion

00:50:05.870 --> 00:50:09.800 align:middle line:84%
becomes chemicals generated
by emotional states.

00:50:09.800 --> 00:50:12.080 align:middle line:90%
And they become addictive.

00:50:12.080 --> 00:50:14.930 align:middle line:84%
My mother used to
say about people,

00:50:14.930 --> 00:50:17.160 align:middle line:84%
it's being so miserable
that keeps him going.

00:50:17.160 --> 00:50:21.060 align:middle line:10%
And you see people, and
we've all experienced it,

00:50:21.060 --> 00:50:24.090 align:middle line:10%
where people
suddenly have nothing

00:50:24.090 --> 00:50:26.140 align:middle line:10%
that they can worry about
or feel anxious about

00:50:26.140 --> 00:50:28.294 align:middle line:10%
and they go into like
emotional cold turkey.

00:50:28.294 --> 00:50:30.210 align:middle line:84%
They've got to find
something to worry about--

00:50:30.210 --> 00:50:30.520 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Find some drama.

00:50:30.520 --> 00:50:31.990 align:middle line:90%
>>ICKE: --to get their fix.

00:50:31.990 --> 00:50:35.050 align:middle line:84%
But this is what
happens when we're

00:50:35.050 --> 00:50:39.010 align:middle line:84%
locked into this
emotional response,

00:50:39.010 --> 00:50:42.460 align:middle line:84%
this emotional
interaction with society.

00:50:42.460 --> 00:50:47.860 align:middle line:10%
And if we can-- we have
the power-- move the point

00:50:47.860 --> 00:50:52.520 align:middle line:10%
that we interact with society
in situations every day to here,

00:50:52.520 --> 00:50:53.771 align:middle line:10%
we respond in a different way.

00:50:53.771 --> 00:50:55.270 align:middle line:10%
>>REGINA: OK, let's
talk about that.

00:50:55.270 --> 00:50:57.090 align:middle line:84%
Because you actually
have taken this on.

00:50:57.090 --> 00:51:00.450 align:middle line:84%
You have, probably, more
people visiting your website

00:51:00.450 --> 00:51:04.010 align:middle line:84%
then small governments or
even medium sized governments,

00:51:04.010 --> 00:51:06.100 align:middle line:90%
I have to say.

00:51:06.100 --> 00:51:07.720 align:middle line:84%
Because there's
something in you that

00:51:07.720 --> 00:51:10.770 align:middle line:84%
is freeing people to
begin at least looking

00:51:10.770 --> 00:51:12.339 align:middle line:90%
at things with new eyes.

00:51:12.339 --> 00:51:14.505 align:middle line:84%
Whether they agree with you
or don't agree with you,

00:51:14.505 --> 00:51:16.505 align:middle line:84%
you always say, you don't
have to agree with me.

00:51:16.505 --> 00:51:20.800 align:middle line:84%
Just open your eyes and start
looking at life in a new way.

00:51:20.800 --> 00:51:23.177 align:middle line:84%
And so one of the things you
wrote about in the newest

00:51:23.177 --> 00:51:25.760 align:middle line:84%
book, which I have right here--
I was going to quote something

00:51:25.760 --> 00:51:28.340 align:middle line:84%
from it, "Remember
Who You Are," is

00:51:28.340 --> 00:51:31.230 align:middle line:84%
that you've put
together in your forum,

00:51:31.230 --> 00:51:34.650 align:middle line:84%
on your site, the potential
for people to come together

00:51:34.650 --> 00:51:36.550 align:middle line:84%
and to start coming
into synchronicity

00:51:36.550 --> 00:51:37.920 align:middle line:90%
with their own hearts first.

00:51:37.920 --> 00:51:41.350 align:middle line:84%
And talk about
what that's about,

00:51:41.350 --> 00:51:43.530 align:middle line:84%
what you're seeing
as a result of it,

00:51:43.530 --> 00:51:45.480 align:middle line:84%
and where you're planning
on going with that.

00:51:45.480 --> 00:51:46.980 align:middle line:84%
Because this is
really the solution.

00:51:46.980 --> 00:51:48.688 align:middle line:84%
>>ICKE: Well, where
I'm planning on going

00:51:48.688 --> 00:51:50.920 align:middle line:84%
is where anyone wants
to go with it, really.

00:51:50.920 --> 00:51:56.470 align:middle line:84%
Again, there is no
vacuum between you

00:51:56.470 --> 00:52:00.490 align:middle line:84%
and me or me and anything
or us and anyone, anything.

00:52:00.490 --> 00:52:03.169 align:middle line:84%
There is the level that
our conscious mind decodes,

00:52:03.169 --> 00:52:05.210 align:middle line:84%
what I call the biological
body computer decodes,

00:52:05.210 --> 00:52:10.200 align:middle line:84%
and that's a tiny, tiny
frequency called visible light.

00:52:10.200 --> 00:52:12.390 align:middle line:84%
But that's not the
only thing that exists.

00:52:12.390 --> 00:52:14.370 align:middle line:84%
In fact, it almost
doesn't exist,

00:52:14.370 --> 00:52:15.960 align:middle line:90%
it's so ludicrously tiny.

00:52:15.960 --> 00:52:19.100 align:middle line:84%
And beyond that are
other energetic levels.

00:52:19.100 --> 00:52:21.180 align:middle line:84%
And those energetic
levels connect us.

00:52:21.180 --> 00:52:24.060 align:middle line:90%
We're one seamless whole.

00:52:24.060 --> 00:52:25.700 align:middle line:84%
They want to
disconnect us from that

00:52:25.700 --> 00:52:29.640 align:middle line:84%
by persuading us that we
are in and of ourselves,

00:52:29.640 --> 00:52:31.220 align:middle line:84%
with no connection
to anything else.

00:52:31.220 --> 00:52:33.660 align:middle line:84%
It's a great way
of divide and rule.

00:52:33.660 --> 00:52:39.120 align:middle line:84%
And therefore we, at
an energetic level,

00:52:39.120 --> 00:52:41.740 align:middle line:84%
electromagnetic
level and beyond,

00:52:41.740 --> 00:52:47.430 align:middle line:84%
are constantly interacting
with this energy sea.

00:52:47.430 --> 00:52:51.030 align:middle line:84%
Simple question, how do
you affect all the fish

00:52:51.030 --> 00:52:52.520 align:middle line:90%
at the same time?

00:52:52.520 --> 00:52:56.480 align:middle line:84%
You affect the sea, and
then you get all the fish.

00:52:56.480 --> 00:53:01.500 align:middle line:84%
And the target of this
cabal of human suppression

00:53:01.500 --> 00:53:05.790 align:middle line:84%
is this energy sea that
we're interacting with.

00:53:05.790 --> 00:53:10.010 align:middle line:84%
And this is what the Satanists
are doing, with their rituals

00:53:10.010 --> 00:53:12.814 align:middle line:84%
at major energy sites
and all the rest of it.

00:53:12.814 --> 00:53:14.980 align:middle line:84%
This was what was happening--
we can talk about this

00:53:14.980 --> 00:53:17.760 align:middle line:84%
on another day-- this is what
was happening at the opening

00:53:17.760 --> 00:53:19.720 align:middle line:84%
and closing ceremonies
of the London Olympics.

00:53:19.720 --> 00:53:21.570 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: That was creepy.

00:53:21.570 --> 00:53:23.690 align:middle line:84%
>>ICKE: It was
creepy for a reason.

00:53:23.690 --> 00:53:26.490 align:middle line:84%
On one level, people are
seeing the holographic level

00:53:26.490 --> 00:53:28.180 align:middle line:84%
of those opening and
closing ceremonies

00:53:28.180 --> 00:53:30.690 align:middle line:84%
as they see the holographic,
i.e., physical, we think,

00:53:30.690 --> 00:53:32.320 align:middle line:90%
level of everything.

00:53:32.320 --> 00:53:34.170 align:middle line:84%
But that's only what
the conscious mind

00:53:34.170 --> 00:53:36.400 align:middle line:84%
is seeing in this tiny
band called visible light.

00:53:36.400 --> 00:53:39.010 align:middle line:84%
The real action's
going on in what

00:53:39.010 --> 00:53:40.910 align:middle line:84%
you could call the
subconscious, because

00:53:40.910 --> 00:53:42.380 align:middle line:84%
in the collective
subconscious and

00:53:42.380 --> 00:53:44.280 align:middle line:90%
the individual subconscious.

00:53:44.280 --> 00:53:45.632 align:middle line:90%
They are targeting that.

00:53:45.632 --> 00:53:47.340 align:middle line:84%
I mean, there are--
I've quoted Satanists

00:53:47.340 --> 00:53:50.650 align:middle line:84%
in my books who have said,
we target the morphic field.

00:53:50.650 --> 00:53:55.190 align:middle line:84%
Because they want to put low
vibrational energy in there,

00:53:55.190 --> 00:53:57.100 align:middle line:84%
which brings the
vibrational state down

00:53:57.100 --> 00:53:58.490 align:middle line:90%
into a state of density.

00:53:58.490 --> 00:54:00.960 align:middle line:84%
People are all, oh, I'm
feeling so heavy today.

00:54:00.960 --> 00:54:05.460 align:middle line:84%
And they want to fill it
with low vibrational emotion

00:54:05.460 --> 00:54:09.940 align:middle line:90%
and horrible information fields.

00:54:09.940 --> 00:54:14.620 align:middle line:84%
And as you-- as we have
been pulled from the heart

00:54:14.620 --> 00:54:23.270 align:middle line:84%
into the belly, we become
contributors, 24/7,

00:54:23.270 --> 00:54:25.120 align:middle line:90%
into this energy field.

00:54:25.120 --> 00:54:27.210 align:middle line:84%
When we feel low
vibrational emotion,

00:54:27.210 --> 00:54:31.080 align:middle line:84%
that doesn't operate in a
vacuum, in a nothingness.

00:54:31.080 --> 00:54:33.270 align:middle line:84%
It actually is
being communicated.

00:54:33.270 --> 00:54:36.200 align:middle line:84%
You know, people say, oh,
whoo, I got bad vibes off him.

00:54:36.200 --> 00:54:37.852 align:middle line:84%
Yes, because you were
literally feeling

00:54:37.852 --> 00:54:40.310 align:middle line:84%
what was coming off him because
of his mental and emotional

00:54:40.310 --> 00:54:41.470 align:middle line:90%
state.

00:54:41.470 --> 00:54:45.120 align:middle line:84%
And thus, there is
two ways to solving

00:54:45.120 --> 00:54:46.560 align:middle line:90%
a situation we don't like.

00:54:46.560 --> 00:54:48.742 align:middle line:84%
One is to find an
answer and one is

00:54:48.742 --> 00:54:50.200 align:middle line:84%
to remove the cause
of the problem,

00:54:50.200 --> 00:54:52.658 align:middle line:84%
always the most intelligent
way of doing things, I suggest.

00:54:52.658 --> 00:54:54.970 align:middle line:90%


00:54:54.970 --> 00:55:00.720 align:middle line:84%
And that is to reverse
this process of what

00:55:00.720 --> 00:55:05.180 align:middle line:84%
we put into the field by
moving our interaction

00:55:05.180 --> 00:55:10.490 align:middle line:84%
point, our decoding of
reality in situations point,

00:55:10.490 --> 00:55:11.780 align:middle line:90%
to the heart.

00:55:11.780 --> 00:55:18.540 align:middle line:84%
Because when you get into a
heart space, a heart state,

00:55:18.540 --> 00:55:22.220 align:middle line:84%
then you're putting into this
sea of energy, which we're

00:55:22.220 --> 00:55:26.270 align:middle line:84%
interacting with all the
time, a very different energy.

00:55:26.270 --> 00:55:31.750 align:middle line:84%
See, this interview, and
every other interview

00:55:31.750 --> 00:55:35.770 align:middle line:90%
doesn't act in isolation.

00:55:35.770 --> 00:55:38.640 align:middle line:84%
It doesn't only affect,
in whatever way,

00:55:38.640 --> 00:55:40.860 align:middle line:90%
people watching this program.

00:55:40.860 --> 00:55:43.330 align:middle line:84%
It's going out, especially
when it's broadcast,

00:55:43.330 --> 00:55:45.920 align:middle line:84%
it's going out as a
vibrational field.

00:55:45.920 --> 00:55:50.160 align:middle line:84%
And it's impacting upon the
collective energy field.

00:55:50.160 --> 00:55:52.620 align:middle line:84%
A microphone, a
notebook, or a newspaper,

00:55:52.620 --> 00:55:55.180 align:middle line:84%
they're not negative
in and of themselves.

00:55:55.180 --> 00:55:58.440 align:middle line:84%
They are-- it's the
way you use them.

00:55:58.440 --> 00:56:02.190 align:middle line:10%
And what I'm doing
through my website

00:56:02.190 --> 00:56:05.290 align:middle line:10%
and what I'm trying to
encourage people to do

00:56:05.290 --> 00:56:09.182 align:middle line:10%
is to first of all
move to this position.

00:56:09.182 --> 00:56:11.640 align:middle line:10%
I mean, you know, society is
always going to be doing that.

00:56:11.640 --> 00:56:14.139 align:middle line:10%
So be kind to
yourself when you have

00:56:14.139 --> 00:56:15.930 align:middle line:10%
a go at the guy that's
cut in front of you.

00:56:15.930 --> 00:56:23.090 align:middle line:84%
But the more you get there,
the less often you do that.

00:56:23.090 --> 00:56:27.969 align:middle line:84%
And to come together, come
together at sacred sites

00:56:27.969 --> 00:56:30.010 align:middle line:84%
where there's particularly
powerful, but not even

00:56:30.010 --> 00:56:32.030 align:middle line:84%
have to do that,
just come together

00:56:32.030 --> 00:56:35.790 align:middle line:90%
and just sit in heart harmony.

00:56:35.790 --> 00:56:38.250 align:middle line:90%
And it's an amazing feeling.

00:56:38.250 --> 00:56:43.930 align:middle line:84%
And instead of
protesting, hurling abuse

00:56:43.930 --> 00:56:47.670 align:middle line:84%
at the people that have
done things you don't like,

00:56:47.670 --> 00:56:51.790 align:middle line:84%
and waving banners,
what is that doing?

00:56:51.790 --> 00:56:54.440 align:middle line:84%
What is throwing fire bombs
at the police in Greece doing?

00:56:54.440 --> 00:56:58.490 align:middle line:84%
You can understand the
anger and frustration

00:56:58.490 --> 00:57:00.450 align:middle line:84%
after what's been
done, terribly,

00:57:00.450 --> 00:57:03.870 align:middle line:84%
to that country by people like
Goldman Sachs and the European

00:57:03.870 --> 00:57:05.010 align:middle line:90%
Union.

00:57:05.010 --> 00:57:08.420 align:middle line:84%
But when we respond
with anger, not passion,

00:57:08.420 --> 00:57:12.750 align:middle line:84%
anger-- we are filling the
sea with the very energy

00:57:12.750 --> 00:57:14.920 align:middle line:90%
they want us to fill it with.

00:57:14.920 --> 00:57:20.200 align:middle line:84%
If we respond with
anger and hatred,

00:57:20.200 --> 00:57:23.070 align:middle line:90%
we're playing in their stadium.

00:57:23.070 --> 00:57:25.310 align:middle line:84%
We need to play in
our stadium, the one

00:57:25.310 --> 00:57:28.710 align:middle line:84%
that humanity was in before
this hijack of our perception

00:57:28.710 --> 00:57:29.760 align:middle line:90%
took place.

00:57:29.760 --> 00:57:31.342 align:middle line:90%
And that is this.

00:57:31.342 --> 00:57:34.400 align:middle line:90%
And so there's two things.

00:57:34.400 --> 00:57:35.770 align:middle line:90%
Go to the heart.

00:57:35.770 --> 00:57:39.642 align:middle line:84%
And the heart doesn't have
fear, so we don't run.

00:57:39.642 --> 00:57:40.600 align:middle line:90%
People think it's weak.

00:57:40.600 --> 00:57:41.440 align:middle line:90%
It's not.

00:57:41.440 --> 00:57:45.700 align:middle line:84%
We go to the heart and that
does what it knows to be right.

00:57:45.700 --> 00:57:48.830 align:middle line:84%
And what it knows to be
right is we are no longer

00:57:48.830 --> 00:57:54.430 align:middle line:84%
going to allow a handful of
insane, deeply imbalanced,

00:57:54.430 --> 00:58:00.720 align:middle line:84%
and very sad people to dictate
the lives of 7 billion.

00:58:00.720 --> 00:58:02.420 align:middle line:90%
That's what that says.

00:58:02.420 --> 00:58:06.340 align:middle line:84%
This says, oh, don't
want to face it.

00:58:06.340 --> 00:58:07.600 align:middle line:90%
Which way do I run?

00:58:07.600 --> 00:58:09.660 align:middle line:90%
This says, we're not having it.

00:58:09.660 --> 00:58:10.650 align:middle line:90%
This is the power.

00:58:10.650 --> 00:58:11.930 align:middle line:90%
And we all have it.

00:58:11.930 --> 00:58:13.450 align:middle line:90%
We've just got to use it.

00:58:13.450 --> 00:58:15.730 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And it's also
called the seat of the soul.

00:58:15.730 --> 00:58:17.760 align:middle line:90%
And I know you fairly well.

00:58:17.760 --> 00:58:20.320 align:middle line:84%
I mean, I've known you off and
on for about seven years now.

00:58:20.320 --> 00:58:22.510 align:middle line:84%
And people see you,
when you're on stage.

00:58:22.510 --> 00:58:27.950 align:middle line:84%
And you fill up the place,
your energy fills up the place.

00:58:27.950 --> 00:58:29.740 align:middle line:84%
And they'll listen to
what you're saying.

00:58:29.740 --> 00:58:32.240 align:middle line:84%
And some people think, oh,
he must be angry over that.

00:58:32.240 --> 00:58:34.000 align:middle line:84%
That's not how I
experience you at all.

00:58:34.000 --> 00:58:36.333 align:middle line:84%
When you're not on stage and
you're not doing your thing

00:58:36.333 --> 00:58:38.220 align:middle line:84%
and sharing your
information, you actually

00:58:38.220 --> 00:58:43.060 align:middle line:84%
are one of the most kind of laid
back and at peace with yourself

00:58:43.060 --> 00:58:44.310 align:middle line:90%
people that I've ever met.

00:58:44.310 --> 00:58:45.150 align:middle line:90%
And I just want to--

00:58:45.150 --> 00:58:46.950 align:middle line:84%
>>ICKE: I'm passionate
about what I'm doing

00:58:46.950 --> 00:58:50.884 align:middle line:84%
and what I'm saying,
because-- two things.

00:58:50.884 --> 00:58:54.090 align:middle line:84%
A, I can see the
incredible, limitless

00:58:54.090 --> 00:58:57.177 align:middle line:90%
potential of Ethel Jones.

00:58:57.177 --> 00:58:59.760 align:middle line:84%
I'm just Ethel Jones, I go down
the store, and all that stuff.

00:58:59.760 --> 00:59:01.000 align:middle line:90%
I'm just little me.

00:59:01.000 --> 00:59:04.050 align:middle line:84%
No, you are infinite
awareness who's

00:59:04.050 --> 00:59:06.390 align:middle line:84%
been manipulated to
believe you are little me.

00:59:06.390 --> 00:59:10.270 align:middle line:84%
And I can see the
way the world is

00:59:10.270 --> 00:59:11.990 align:middle line:84%
designed to be if
we don't sort it.

00:59:11.990 --> 00:59:13.489 align:middle line:84%
That's where the
passion comes from.

00:59:13.489 --> 00:59:16.110 align:middle line:84%
But getting angry
is not the way.

00:59:16.110 --> 00:59:17.207 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: It's not at all.

00:59:17.207 --> 00:59:18.540 align:middle line:90%
And I want to thank you so much.

00:59:18.540 --> 00:59:21.030 align:middle line:84%
Once again, number
eight, our lucky number,

00:59:21.030 --> 00:59:22.900 align:middle line:90%
for being here with me today.

00:59:22.900 --> 00:59:25.430 align:middle line:84%
>>ICKE: Pleasure,
Regina, thanks very much.

00:59:25.430 --> 00:59:34.000 align:middle line:90%
