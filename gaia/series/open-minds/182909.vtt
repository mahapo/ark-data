00:00:20.030 --> 00:00:21.780 align:middle line:10%
>>REGINA MEREDITH: I
know that many of you

00:00:21.780 --> 00:00:24.990 align:middle line:10%
have had anomalous experiences,
which is probably why you're

00:00:24.990 --> 00:00:26.850 align:middle line:10%
exploring this show right now.

00:00:26.850 --> 00:00:29.130 align:middle line:10%
The nuances to be
understood in loosening

00:00:29.130 --> 00:00:32.689 align:middle line:10%
our consciousness from our
physical reality are vast.

00:00:32.689 --> 00:00:35.580 align:middle line:84%
And Luis Minero is here with
us today to explain this,

00:00:35.580 --> 00:00:38.460 align:middle line:84%
via the subject of
out-of-body experiences.

00:00:38.460 --> 00:00:39.450 align:middle line:90%
Welcome, Luis.

00:00:39.450 --> 00:00:39.780 align:middle line:90%
>>LUIS MINERO: Thank you.

00:00:39.780 --> 00:00:40.580 align:middle line:90%
Thank you, Regina.

00:00:40.580 --> 00:00:41.770 align:middle line:90%
A pleasure being here.

00:00:41.770 --> 00:00:43.445 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: This is
so common for you.

00:00:43.445 --> 00:00:45.070 align:middle line:84%
You've been doing
this your whole life.

00:00:45.070 --> 00:00:48.960 align:middle line:84%
But let's talk about your
out-of-body experiences,

00:00:48.960 --> 00:00:51.060 align:middle line:84%
starting at a young
age-- at the age of 12,

00:00:51.060 --> 00:00:53.340 align:middle line:84%
just to let people
get to know you a bit

00:00:53.340 --> 00:00:57.060 align:middle line:84%
and start launching forward
into this intriguing topic.

00:00:57.060 --> 00:00:59.520 align:middle line:10%
>>MINERO: Yeah, the first
out-of-body experience, indeed

00:00:59.520 --> 00:01:01.570 align:middle line:10%
was when I was 12 years old.

00:01:01.570 --> 00:01:03.880 align:middle line:10%
I didn't know that
there was a name for it.

00:01:03.880 --> 00:01:06.990 align:middle line:10%
It just happened spontaneously,
on a day when I had just

00:01:06.990 --> 00:01:08.280 align:middle line:10%
gotten back from school.

00:01:08.280 --> 00:01:11.490 align:middle line:84%
I usually had the habit
of going into my computer,

00:01:11.490 --> 00:01:13.080 align:middle line:90%
way back in the '80s--

00:01:13.080 --> 00:01:15.330 align:middle line:84%
it wasn't like the
computers today--

00:01:15.330 --> 00:01:17.700 align:middle line:84%
and just playing around,
fooling around a little bit.

00:01:17.700 --> 00:01:19.760 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Pokemon, or--

00:01:19.760 --> 00:01:21.993 align:middle line:84%
>>MINERO: I wish
Pokemon was available.

00:01:21.993 --> 00:01:23.910 align:middle line:84%
But it was really just
a programming language,

00:01:23.910 --> 00:01:26.260 align:middle line:90%
very bare bones.

00:01:26.260 --> 00:01:30.060 align:middle line:84%
And on that specific afternoon,
I laid down in bed to sleep.

00:01:30.060 --> 00:01:33.540 align:middle line:84%
And then, maybe because I was
still intrigued by the program

00:01:33.540 --> 00:01:36.060 align:middle line:84%
that I was trying to
design, about a half an hour

00:01:36.060 --> 00:01:38.580 align:middle line:84%
afterwards, I realized
that I was aware,

00:01:38.580 --> 00:01:42.240 align:middle line:84%
staring at the black-and-white
monitor at that time,

00:01:42.240 --> 00:01:43.650 align:middle line:90%
with my hands on the keyboard.

00:01:43.650 --> 00:01:45.780 align:middle line:84%
And I was still thinking
about the program.

00:01:45.780 --> 00:01:48.030 align:middle line:84%
But all of a sudden,
something dawned on me.

00:01:48.030 --> 00:01:51.740 align:middle line:84%
And I realized-- wait a
second, didn't I go to sleep?

00:01:51.740 --> 00:01:54.240 align:middle line:84%
And the moment I turned
around to look at my bed,

00:01:54.240 --> 00:01:55.710 align:middle line:90%
my body was there.

00:01:55.710 --> 00:01:57.850 align:middle line:84%
It sort of like surprised
me a little bit.

00:01:57.850 --> 00:01:59.423 align:middle line:90%
And I went into my body.

00:01:59.423 --> 00:02:00.840 align:middle line:84%
And obviously, I
didn't understand

00:02:00.840 --> 00:02:01.870 align:middle line:90%
what had just happened.

00:02:01.870 --> 00:02:06.450 align:middle line:84%
I just knew that it was
a very clear experience.

00:02:06.450 --> 00:02:09.539 align:middle line:84%
And I was thinking,
was I just here?

00:02:09.539 --> 00:02:10.380 align:middle line:90%
Was I there?

00:02:10.380 --> 00:02:10.979 align:middle line:90%
Was I here?

00:02:10.979 --> 00:02:11.779 align:middle line:90%
Was I there?

00:02:11.779 --> 00:02:15.015 align:middle line:84%
And really, that first
experience was eye opening.

00:02:15.015 --> 00:02:15.890 align:middle line:90%
But it was confusing.

00:02:15.890 --> 00:02:17.680 align:middle line:84%
I had no idea what
had just happened.

00:02:17.680 --> 00:02:18.790 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:02:18.790 --> 00:02:21.587 align:middle line:84%
OK, now, it's not like it
just stopped there, though.

00:02:21.587 --> 00:02:22.420 align:middle line:90%
>>MINERO: It didn't.

00:02:22.420 --> 00:02:23.795 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So let's
talk about how

00:02:23.795 --> 00:02:25.740 align:middle line:84%
it progressed after
that, because now you're

00:02:25.740 --> 00:02:26.790 align:middle line:90%
just confused.

00:02:26.790 --> 00:02:28.260 align:middle line:90%
>>MINERO: Yeah, I was.

00:02:28.260 --> 00:02:31.230 align:middle line:84%
And then after that,
I started having

00:02:31.230 --> 00:02:33.540 align:middle line:84%
out-of-body experiences--
not a whole lot,

00:02:33.540 --> 00:02:37.013 align:middle line:84%
maybe once every six
months or once a year.

00:02:37.013 --> 00:02:39.180 align:middle line:84%
And at the beginning, I
didn't know what I could do.

00:02:39.180 --> 00:02:41.160 align:middle line:84%
I had never read
anything, really.

00:02:41.160 --> 00:02:44.730 align:middle line:84%
So I would be floating in my
bedroom, looking at my body.

00:02:44.730 --> 00:02:47.040 align:middle line:84%
Or I would be
floating in the house.

00:02:47.040 --> 00:02:48.900 align:middle line:84%
And I remember
seeing a few times

00:02:48.900 --> 00:02:52.500 align:middle line:84%
the dog going to
drink some water

00:02:52.500 --> 00:02:54.970 align:middle line:84%
and then come back to
his spot and sleep.

00:02:54.970 --> 00:02:56.910 align:middle line:84%
And I would try a couple
of times to pet him.

00:02:56.910 --> 00:02:59.020 align:middle line:90%
And my hand would go through.

00:02:59.020 --> 00:03:01.330 align:middle line:84%
But I really didn't
know what to do.

00:03:01.330 --> 00:03:06.570 align:middle line:84%
And it wasn't until I was 16 or
17 that I read the first book.

00:03:06.570 --> 00:03:10.060 align:middle line:84%
And the author referred to
out-of-body experiences,

00:03:10.060 --> 00:03:11.820 align:middle line:90%
to astral travel.

00:03:11.820 --> 00:03:14.590 align:middle line:84%
Probably many viewers
have already heard of him.

00:03:14.590 --> 00:03:15.465 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Which book?

00:03:15.465 --> 00:03:17.650 align:middle line:84%
>>MINERO: Yes, Lobsang
Rampa, "The Third Eye."

00:03:17.650 --> 00:03:18.450 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:03:18.450 --> 00:03:23.100 align:middle line:84%
>>MINERO: So this is obviously
a book from the '50s, I believe.

00:03:23.100 --> 00:03:26.490 align:middle line:84%
And afterwards, I read a book
about him, I think in English.

00:03:26.490 --> 00:03:28.810 align:middle line:90%
The name was "Beyond Infinity."

00:03:28.810 --> 00:03:29.610 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:03:29.610 --> 00:03:33.330 align:middle line:84%
>>MINERO: And in
it, he had a program

00:03:33.330 --> 00:03:35.548 align:middle line:84%
on how to develop your
out-of-body experiences.

00:03:35.548 --> 00:03:36.840 align:middle line:90%
And that really got me started.

00:03:36.840 --> 00:03:40.260 align:middle line:84%
And afterwards, I started
trying to get my hands on all

00:03:40.260 --> 00:03:42.390 align:middle line:84%
the books that I could on
out-of-body experiences,

00:03:42.390 --> 00:03:44.130 align:middle line:90%
and tried different techniques.

00:03:44.130 --> 00:03:47.790 align:middle line:84%
And everything in that obviously
helped me to develop them.

00:03:47.790 --> 00:03:50.520 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Could you do
this consciously then?

00:03:50.520 --> 00:03:52.500 align:middle line:84%
You could choose
out-of-body experiences?

00:03:52.500 --> 00:03:55.020 align:middle line:84%
Or were you just trying to
dissect them and use them when

00:03:55.020 --> 00:03:56.430 align:middle line:90%
they randomly happened to you?

00:03:56.430 --> 00:03:57.480 align:middle line:84%
>>MINERO: Yeah,
at the beginning,

00:03:57.480 --> 00:03:59.520 align:middle line:84%
when I was a teenager,
I couldn't induce them.

00:03:59.520 --> 00:03:59.730 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:03:59.730 --> 00:04:01.590 align:middle line:84%
>>MINERO: They would
just simply happen.

00:04:01.590 --> 00:04:03.560 align:middle line:84%
Actually, I wanted
for them to happen.

00:04:03.560 --> 00:04:05.760 align:middle line:90%
But I didn't know how to.

00:04:05.760 --> 00:04:06.940 align:middle line:10%
They would just happen.

00:04:06.940 --> 00:04:08.760 align:middle line:10%
And in some of them,
my level of awareness

00:04:08.760 --> 00:04:11.580 align:middle line:10%
was like right now, very clear.

00:04:11.580 --> 00:04:12.580 align:middle line:90%
And then I could choose.

00:04:12.580 --> 00:04:14.490 align:middle line:84%
I could choose to
go here or there.

00:04:14.490 --> 00:04:16.110 align:middle line:84%
And on others, my
level of awareness

00:04:16.110 --> 00:04:19.440 align:middle line:84%
was a little bit more
intermediary, more dreamlike,

00:04:19.440 --> 00:04:22.770 align:middle line:84%
probably like what happens to
many people at the beginning.

00:04:22.770 --> 00:04:25.670 align:middle line:84%
And then I would just
remember, afterwards,

00:04:25.670 --> 00:04:26.850 align:middle line:90%
the out-of-body experience.

00:04:26.850 --> 00:04:28.920 align:middle line:84%
And I realized that I
didn't have as much control

00:04:28.920 --> 00:04:31.480 align:middle line:90%
as in other opportunities.

00:04:31.480 --> 00:04:34.980 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And kids, oftentimes,
may be having these.

00:04:34.980 --> 00:04:37.268 align:middle line:84%
But they're not sharing
that information

00:04:37.268 --> 00:04:38.560 align:middle line:90%
because they think it's normal.

00:04:38.560 --> 00:04:39.435 align:middle line:90%
>>MINERO: I think so.

00:04:39.435 --> 00:04:42.230 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And so they don't
really express anything.

00:04:42.230 --> 00:04:44.130 align:middle line:84%
Or they don't have the
language to explain

00:04:44.130 --> 00:04:45.270 align:middle line:90%
what's happened, right?

00:04:45.270 --> 00:04:46.395 align:middle line:90%
>>MINERO: Yeah, I think so.

00:04:46.395 --> 00:04:48.420 align:middle line:84%
Even in many dreams,
not just as kids

00:04:48.420 --> 00:04:51.120 align:middle line:84%
but as adults, when we
think that we are dreaming--

00:04:51.120 --> 00:04:54.580 align:middle line:84%
or sorry, dreaming
that we are flying--

00:04:54.580 --> 00:04:55.380 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:04:55.380 --> 00:04:56.700 align:middle line:84%
>>MINERO: Many of
those, sometimes,

00:04:56.700 --> 00:04:58.000 align:middle line:90%
are out-of-body experiences.

00:04:58.000 --> 00:04:59.550 align:middle line:84%
And sometimes the
level of awareness

00:04:59.550 --> 00:05:00.930 align:middle line:90%
is a little bit lower.

00:05:00.930 --> 00:05:04.090 align:middle line:84%
And thus, we tend to
interpret them as dreams.

00:05:04.090 --> 00:05:04.890 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:05:04.890 --> 00:05:07.020 align:middle line:84%
I've always wondered
about that, because it

00:05:07.020 --> 00:05:09.480 align:middle line:84%
seems that some of those
happen in the morning just

00:05:09.480 --> 00:05:13.230 align:middle line:84%
before waking up, or even in
that crossover time, especially

00:05:13.230 --> 00:05:15.190 align:middle line:84%
the flying dreams,
in particular.

00:05:15.190 --> 00:05:16.153 align:middle line:90%
>>MINERO: Yeah.

00:05:16.153 --> 00:05:18.320 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Where you can
bound over from mountain top

00:05:18.320 --> 00:05:19.040 align:middle line:90%
to mountain top--

00:05:19.040 --> 00:05:19.110 align:middle line:90%
>>MINERO: Exactly.

00:05:19.110 --> 00:05:21.000 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And then
just take off and fly.

00:05:21.000 --> 00:05:22.998 align:middle line:84%
And you're saying, often
those are not dreams.

00:05:22.998 --> 00:05:25.290 align:middle line:84%
>>MINERO: Especially those
in which you are just simply

00:05:25.290 --> 00:05:27.532 align:middle line:84%
jumping over a couple
of hills or two trees--

00:05:27.532 --> 00:05:28.740 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah, I love those.

00:05:28.740 --> 00:05:31.860 align:middle line:84%
>>MINERO: Those are more than
likely out-of-body experiences.

00:05:31.860 --> 00:05:35.460 align:middle line:84%
It seems that on those
opportunities we left the body.

00:05:35.460 --> 00:05:38.140 align:middle line:84%
And the astral body's
just simply carrying

00:05:38.140 --> 00:05:41.588 align:middle line:84%
a denser load of energies
from the physical body.

00:05:41.588 --> 00:05:43.380 align:middle line:84%
And because of that,
our level of awareness

00:05:43.380 --> 00:05:44.860 align:middle line:90%
is a little bit lower.

00:05:44.860 --> 00:05:48.690 align:middle line:84%
But also, we're not able
to fully stay flying.

00:05:48.690 --> 00:05:50.400 align:middle line:90%
But we start jumping.

00:05:50.400 --> 00:05:53.760 align:middle line:84%
Or people dream that they are
swimming close to the ground

00:05:53.760 --> 00:05:54.820 align:middle line:90%
and struggle to advance.

00:05:54.820 --> 00:05:55.620 align:middle line:90%
>>LUIS MINERO: Yes.

00:05:55.620 --> 00:05:57.495 align:middle line:84%
>>MINERO: For some
reason, it's breaststroke,

00:05:57.495 --> 00:05:59.280 align:middle line:90%
a lot of the times.

00:05:59.280 --> 00:06:01.248 align:middle line:84%
Those usually are
out-of-body experiences.

00:06:01.248 --> 00:06:02.790 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Oh, now
that's interesting,

00:06:02.790 --> 00:06:05.070 align:middle line:84%
because it's bringing up the
question I've always had.

00:06:05.070 --> 00:06:08.730 align:middle line:84%
And it's never been
explained back to me

00:06:08.730 --> 00:06:11.700 align:middle line:84%
in terms of dream analysis,
dream time experience.

00:06:11.700 --> 00:06:14.550 align:middle line:84%
And that is, in these
dreams of bounding,

00:06:14.550 --> 00:06:17.740 align:middle line:84%
just bounding from one
mountain top to the next

00:06:17.740 --> 00:06:20.550 align:middle line:84%
and then just take off
and fly from there,

00:06:20.550 --> 00:06:22.540 align:middle line:90%
the landscape is different.

00:06:22.540 --> 00:06:26.790 align:middle line:84%
It's not the same as
Earth landscape, in that--

00:06:26.790 --> 00:06:28.590 align:middle line:90%
in my experiences, anyway--

00:06:28.590 --> 00:06:30.397 align:middle line:90%
everything is larger to scale.

00:06:30.397 --> 00:06:31.980 align:middle line:84%
>>MINERO: Yeah, it
could very well be.

00:06:31.980 --> 00:06:32.220 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

00:06:32.220 --> 00:06:34.380 align:middle line:84%
And it could be that you're
in another dimension.

00:06:34.380 --> 00:06:36.130 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Well, that's
what I'm wondering.

00:06:36.130 --> 00:06:37.890 align:middle line:84%
What do you think in
that situation, where

00:06:37.890 --> 00:06:39.350 align:middle line:90%
you're close to waking up.

00:06:39.350 --> 00:06:42.300 align:middle line:84%
You're bounding and having
these flying bounding dreams.

00:06:42.300 --> 00:06:45.630 align:middle line:84%
But you're in this world that
is much larger to scale--

00:06:45.630 --> 00:06:49.730 align:middle line:84%
big bodies of water,
big mountains and hills.

00:06:49.730 --> 00:06:50.530 align:middle line:90%
>>MINERO: Right.

00:06:50.530 --> 00:06:54.030 align:middle line:84%
And I can tell you I
have had both of the ones

00:06:54.030 --> 00:06:57.660 align:middle line:84%
that I'm just bouncing
and it's close to my house

00:06:57.660 --> 00:06:59.250 align:middle line:84%
or where I was
living at the time.

00:06:59.250 --> 00:07:01.890 align:middle line:84%
But I've also had those in
which the landscape is just

00:07:01.890 --> 00:07:02.830 align:middle line:90%
completely different.

00:07:02.830 --> 00:07:05.400 align:middle line:84%
And I realized, this
is another dimension.

00:07:05.400 --> 00:07:08.610 align:middle line:84%
Even in places where I
have another out-of-body

00:07:08.610 --> 00:07:09.540 align:middle line:90%
experiences--

00:07:09.540 --> 00:07:10.810 align:middle line:90%
I have been there.

00:07:10.810 --> 00:07:12.830 align:middle line:84%
And I have been very
aware, very conscious.

00:07:12.830 --> 00:07:18.570 align:middle line:84%
And then when I'm in this dreams
of just bouncing up and down,

00:07:18.570 --> 00:07:20.550 align:middle line:90%
I recognize the landscape.

00:07:20.550 --> 00:07:23.010 align:middle line:84%
So more than likely, it
is another dimension.

00:07:23.010 --> 00:07:25.635 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: It's another dimension
that is very similar to Earth.

00:07:25.635 --> 00:07:26.435 align:middle line:90%
>>MINERO: Indeed.

00:07:26.435 --> 00:07:27.727 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: But it's more sparse.

00:07:27.727 --> 00:07:28.527 align:middle line:90%
>>MINERO: It is.

00:07:28.527 --> 00:07:30.180 align:middle line:84%
And another thing
that is interesting--

00:07:30.180 --> 00:07:34.300 align:middle line:84%
and I remember a student
of mine was realizing this,

00:07:34.300 --> 00:07:36.930 align:middle line:84%
that many times when you develop
your out-of-body experiences

00:07:36.930 --> 00:07:39.060 align:middle line:84%
and you're having one
with a lot of awareness,

00:07:39.060 --> 00:07:41.430 align:middle line:84%
and you're outside your
body, what you'll see

00:07:41.430 --> 00:07:46.140 align:middle line:84%
is some people passing by
in front of you, bouncing.

00:07:46.140 --> 00:07:48.270 align:middle line:84%
And you realize,
oh, this is what

00:07:48.270 --> 00:07:50.500 align:middle line:90%
I used to do for so many years.

00:07:50.500 --> 00:07:51.300 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:07:51.300 --> 00:07:52.452 align:middle line:90%
>>MINERO: So you see that.

00:07:52.452 --> 00:07:53.910 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Well,
that's interesting.

00:07:53.910 --> 00:07:56.535 align:middle line:84%
This is the first time I've ever
considered that I was actually

00:07:56.535 --> 00:07:58.350 align:middle line:84%
just in an out-of-body
experience,

00:07:58.350 --> 00:08:00.480 align:middle line:84%
but not fully
cognizant because it

00:08:00.480 --> 00:08:02.130 align:middle line:90%
was dovetailing on dream time.

00:08:02.130 --> 00:08:02.530 align:middle line:90%
>>MINERO: Right.

00:08:02.530 --> 00:08:04.155 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And there's
so many of these.

00:08:04.155 --> 00:08:06.060 align:middle line:84%
I think this notion
of out-of-body--

00:08:06.060 --> 00:08:09.360 align:middle line:84%
and I want to get into
all this history, and kids

00:08:09.360 --> 00:08:11.940 align:middle line:84%
and all of it, and our
brains and how they're wired.

00:08:11.940 --> 00:08:15.090 align:middle line:84%
But since we're on this,
there's this other experience

00:08:15.090 --> 00:08:17.820 align:middle line:84%
I have now and then
of swapping bodies

00:08:17.820 --> 00:08:19.890 align:middle line:84%
with someone for an
experiment, almost

00:08:19.890 --> 00:08:22.350 align:middle line:90%
like there's a group of people.

00:08:22.350 --> 00:08:26.460 align:middle line:84%
And we just signal each other
and say, let's change vehicles.

00:08:26.460 --> 00:08:27.930 align:middle line:84%
And then we'll
prove it when people

00:08:27.930 --> 00:08:29.490 align:middle line:84%
ask us questions
about ourselves,

00:08:29.490 --> 00:08:34.409 align:middle line:84%
that kind of thing, just to
show people anyone can do this.

00:08:34.409 --> 00:08:38.010 align:middle line:84%
Have you ever heard of
that kind of experience?

00:08:38.010 --> 00:08:39.331 align:middle line:90%
Or is that just maybe a dream?

00:08:39.331 --> 00:08:40.539 align:middle line:90%
>>MINERO: I have heard of it.

00:08:40.539 --> 00:08:42.638 align:middle line:84%
And I think that probably
what is happening

00:08:42.638 --> 00:08:44.430 align:middle line:84%
is more than anything,
that there is a very

00:08:44.430 --> 00:08:46.330 align:middle line:90%
strong energetic coupling.

00:08:46.330 --> 00:08:48.180 align:middle line:84%
And it's almost
as if both of you

00:08:48.180 --> 00:08:53.280 align:middle line:84%
are reading each other's
essences, in summary.

00:08:53.280 --> 00:08:56.410 align:middle line:84%
And then you know-- or
one person, person A,

00:08:56.410 --> 00:08:59.530 align:middle line:84%
knows what is happening with
person B, and vice versa.

00:08:59.530 --> 00:09:02.500 align:middle line:84%
And that seems to be what
is occurring in that sense.

00:09:02.500 --> 00:09:03.570 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Interesting.

00:09:03.570 --> 00:09:06.028 align:middle line:84%
Well, and this one time, she
wouldn't give me my body back.

00:09:06.028 --> 00:09:07.223 align:middle line:90%
And she was really old.

00:09:07.223 --> 00:09:08.190 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHTER]

00:09:08.190 --> 00:09:09.690 align:middle line:84%
>>MINERO: Yeah, I
would ask it back.

00:09:09.690 --> 00:09:11.067 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So I
asked for it back.

00:09:11.067 --> 00:09:12.150 align:middle line:90%
She wouldn't give it back.

00:09:12.150 --> 00:09:15.007 align:middle line:90%
So lest I digress any further--

00:09:15.007 --> 00:09:16.590 align:middle line:84%
so when we're talking
about with kids,

00:09:16.590 --> 00:09:18.270 align:middle line:84%
you were talking
about other dimensions

00:09:18.270 --> 00:09:19.800 align:middle line:84%
just a moment ago,
about how they

00:09:19.800 --> 00:09:21.090 align:middle line:90%
work when we're out of body.

00:09:21.090 --> 00:09:22.770 align:middle line:84%
And we just give
an example of, it

00:09:22.770 --> 00:09:26.140 align:middle line:84%
can be a different landscape,
time, space, connection.

00:09:26.140 --> 00:09:27.780 align:middle line:84%
Let's talk about
the dimensions we

00:09:27.780 --> 00:09:30.123 align:middle line:84%
can land in, because I'm
sure some people have.

00:09:30.123 --> 00:09:32.040 align:middle line:84%
And like me, they didn't
know where they were.

00:09:32.040 --> 00:09:32.840 align:middle line:90%
>>MINERO: Right.

00:09:32.840 --> 00:09:34.860 align:middle line:84%
And really, there are
so many different ways

00:09:34.860 --> 00:09:37.510 align:middle line:84%
of organizing them
or classifying them.

00:09:37.510 --> 00:09:41.460 align:middle line:10%
I've seen different authors and
different schools of thought

00:09:41.460 --> 00:09:44.010 align:middle line:10%
classifying them in
different fashions.

00:09:44.010 --> 00:09:46.860 align:middle line:10%
But in that sense,
there are many, first

00:09:46.860 --> 00:09:48.060 align:middle line:10%
of all, many, many, many.

00:09:48.060 --> 00:09:52.230 align:middle line:84%
I couldn't give you a number,
but in the range of thousands,

00:09:52.230 --> 00:09:53.310 align:middle line:90%
tens of thousands.

00:09:53.310 --> 00:09:57.640 align:middle line:84%
It doesn't seem to be like
stars in the universe,

00:09:57.640 --> 00:09:59.790 align:middle line:84%
that now we're going to
billions and trillions.

00:09:59.790 --> 00:10:03.500 align:middle line:84%
It seems to be in the
range of tens of thousands.

00:10:03.500 --> 00:10:05.520 align:middle line:84%
And they can be very
different, indeed.

00:10:05.520 --> 00:10:07.290 align:middle line:84%
Some of them can
look very similar

00:10:07.290 --> 00:10:10.500 align:middle line:84%
to the physical
reality, where there

00:10:10.500 --> 00:10:12.750 align:middle line:84%
is a ground where even
though you're flying,

00:10:12.750 --> 00:10:14.852 align:middle line:84%
you see over what
you are flying.

00:10:14.852 --> 00:10:16.310 align:middle line:84%
And there are
certain elements that

00:10:16.310 --> 00:10:18.820 align:middle line:84%
are very similar to
the physical reality.

00:10:18.820 --> 00:10:21.760 align:middle line:84%
And there are other
dimensions where

00:10:21.760 --> 00:10:26.320 align:middle line:84%
objects and the things
that we use as references

00:10:26.320 --> 00:10:30.970 align:middle line:84%
and that we hold dear, they
start to disappear and then

00:10:30.970 --> 00:10:34.630 align:middle line:84%
start to become much
more abstract, maybe,

00:10:34.630 --> 00:10:37.500 align:middle line:84%
would be the description, the
sense that, for example, I've

00:10:37.500 --> 00:10:40.990 align:middle line:84%
been in certain of these where
there is no ground at all.

00:10:40.990 --> 00:10:44.050 align:middle line:84%
The conversation is completely
mental or telepathic,

00:10:44.050 --> 00:10:46.420 align:middle line:90%
as people like to describe it.

00:10:46.420 --> 00:10:49.360 align:middle line:84%
And then there is also, for
example, no concept of gravity.

00:10:49.360 --> 00:10:52.120 align:middle line:84%
So you are standing
in this position,

00:10:52.120 --> 00:10:53.320 align:middle line:90%
talking to somebody else.

00:10:53.320 --> 00:10:53.680 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:10:53.680 --> 00:10:54.580 align:middle line:84%
>>MINERO: And the
other person comes

00:10:54.580 --> 00:10:56.230 align:middle line:90%
to talk to you, like this.

00:10:56.230 --> 00:10:57.880 align:middle line:84%
And the heads are
relatively close.

00:10:57.880 --> 00:11:00.280 align:middle line:84%
But the feet are pointing
in a different direction.

00:11:00.280 --> 00:11:02.050 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Right, and
you're suspended.

00:11:02.050 --> 00:11:03.592 align:middle line:84%
>>MINERO: And you're
suspended, yeah.

00:11:03.592 --> 00:11:05.320 align:middle line:84%
And a third person
comes to talk to you

00:11:05.320 --> 00:11:07.050 align:middle line:90%
diagonally from the other two.

00:11:07.050 --> 00:11:08.890 align:middle line:90%
And all the heads are close.

00:11:08.890 --> 00:11:10.720 align:middle line:84%
But there is no
concept of up and down.

00:11:10.720 --> 00:11:13.150 align:middle line:84%
There is no gravity
and it just simply

00:11:13.150 --> 00:11:14.670 align:middle line:90%
didn't exist in this dimension.

00:11:14.670 --> 00:11:18.400 align:middle line:84%
So a lot of these elements
of the physical reality

00:11:18.400 --> 00:11:20.982 align:middle line:84%
seem like they start to
disappear in other dimensions.

00:11:20.982 --> 00:11:22.690 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Because I
think a lot of people

00:11:22.690 --> 00:11:24.800 align:middle line:84%
are intrigued with out-of-body
because they think,

00:11:24.800 --> 00:11:27.520 align:middle line:84%
oh, I can go travel
and see what someone

00:11:27.520 --> 00:11:30.280 align:middle line:84%
in another city-- what my
mom's up to or something,

00:11:30.280 --> 00:11:33.760 align:middle line:84%
and look at it from these
more common reference points.

00:11:33.760 --> 00:11:34.560 align:middle line:90%
>>MINERO: Yes.

00:11:34.560 --> 00:11:38.380 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: But you find that
the fascination, oftentimes,

00:11:38.380 --> 00:11:40.660 align:middle line:84%
is in that it's so
uncommon to anything

00:11:40.660 --> 00:11:42.510 align:middle line:84%
we understand in our
physical reality.

00:11:42.510 --> 00:11:43.310 align:middle line:90%
>>MINERO: Yes.

00:11:43.310 --> 00:11:46.000 align:middle line:84%
And I would say most
people at the beginning,

00:11:46.000 --> 00:11:47.800 align:middle line:84%
they end up having
out-of-body experiences

00:11:47.800 --> 00:11:50.170 align:middle line:84%
in the physical reality,
because that's what they want.

00:11:50.170 --> 00:11:51.087 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right, yeah.

00:11:51.087 --> 00:11:53.620 align:middle line:84%
>>MINERO: Exactly, they want
to go visit another girlfriend,

00:11:53.620 --> 00:11:55.240 align:middle line:90%
or whatever.

00:11:55.240 --> 00:11:58.750 align:middle line:84%
But little by little,
you start to realize--

00:11:58.750 --> 00:11:59.830 align:middle line:90%
let me start by this.

00:11:59.830 --> 00:12:01.210 align:middle line:84%
Some people at
the beginning even

00:12:01.210 --> 00:12:03.190 align:middle line:84%
have a lot of
objectives of things

00:12:03.190 --> 00:12:06.700 align:middle line:84%
or of places where they want
to go in the physical reality.

00:12:06.700 --> 00:12:08.215 align:middle line:90%
And they're not wrong.

00:12:08.215 --> 00:12:09.340 align:middle line:90%
They're not bad objectives.

00:12:09.340 --> 00:12:12.150 align:middle line:84%
It's just that the moment that
you start to understand better

00:12:12.150 --> 00:12:15.190 align:middle line:84%
the non-physical
realities, your objectives

00:12:15.190 --> 00:12:17.290 align:middle line:84%
start to become
more non-physical.

00:12:17.290 --> 00:12:18.850 align:middle line:84%
And now you don't
really want to go

00:12:18.850 --> 00:12:24.710 align:middle line:84%
visit physical things that you
can arrive at with a plane.

00:12:24.710 --> 00:12:26.865 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Right, with
an airplane, or a train.

00:12:26.865 --> 00:12:28.240 align:middle line:84%
>>MINERO: Yeah,
with an airplane.

00:12:28.240 --> 00:12:30.550 align:middle line:84%
Now you want to go
to other dimensions

00:12:30.550 --> 00:12:34.930 align:middle line:84%
and see things that are going
to further your information,

00:12:34.930 --> 00:12:36.490 align:middle line:90%
your knowledge, I would say.

00:12:36.490 --> 00:12:38.650 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Share with
us some of the really

00:12:38.650 --> 00:12:41.560 align:middle line:84%
amazing, unique-- or
favorite experiences

00:12:41.560 --> 00:12:45.820 align:middle line:84%
you've had in other dimensions,
things where you brought

00:12:45.820 --> 00:12:48.310 align:middle line:84%
back maybe even useful
information or deeper

00:12:48.310 --> 00:12:49.820 align:middle line:90%
understandings.

00:12:49.820 --> 00:12:52.450 align:middle line:90%
>>MINERO: Yeah.

00:12:52.450 --> 00:12:53.950 align:middle line:90%
Let me go with a couple here.

00:12:53.950 --> 00:12:57.850 align:middle line:84%
First, just seeing
the preparation

00:12:57.850 --> 00:13:02.590 align:middle line:84%
that some people undergo
before being reborn,

00:13:02.590 --> 00:13:05.170 align:middle line:90%
because there are many people--

00:13:05.170 --> 00:13:08.530 align:middle line:84%
and many people, I would
say, when they are here

00:13:08.530 --> 00:13:11.380 align:middle line:84%
in the physical reality,
they feel like they

00:13:11.380 --> 00:13:12.870 align:middle line:90%
were born to do something.

00:13:12.870 --> 00:13:13.670 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:13:13.670 --> 00:13:16.405 align:middle line:84%
>>MINERO: Like they have a
life purpose, a life task.

00:13:16.405 --> 00:13:18.460 align:middle line:84%
And to a very great
extent, it seems

00:13:18.460 --> 00:13:22.300 align:middle line:84%
that that feeling comes
because they prepare themselves

00:13:22.300 --> 00:13:25.370 align:middle line:90%
for those tasks or lessons.

00:13:25.370 --> 00:13:26.245 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Previously?

00:13:26.245 --> 00:13:28.870 align:middle line:84%
>>MINERO: Previously,
before being born.

00:13:28.870 --> 00:13:31.720 align:middle line:84%
So it is interesting
to leave the body

00:13:31.720 --> 00:13:34.570 align:middle line:84%
and to see those people
preparing for those tasks.

00:13:34.570 --> 00:13:36.500 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Oh, tell
us what that's like.

00:13:36.500 --> 00:13:39.190 align:middle line:84%
>>MINERO: So some
of those realities--

00:13:39.190 --> 00:13:42.610 align:middle line:84%
first of all, some of
those, they can look almost

00:13:42.610 --> 00:13:45.070 align:middle line:84%
like a university
class, like a course

00:13:45.070 --> 00:13:46.795 align:middle line:90%
that people are undertaking.

00:13:46.795 --> 00:13:52.030 align:middle line:84%
And there are classes in
some of these dimensions

00:13:52.030 --> 00:13:55.120 align:middle line:84%
basically for any topic,
to try to understand deeper

00:13:55.120 --> 00:13:58.600 align:middle line:84%
the physical body or the
energetic body, for example,

00:13:58.600 --> 00:14:02.800 align:middle line:84%
or trying to study concepts
more like ethics and openness

00:14:02.800 --> 00:14:03.820 align:middle line:90%
and assistance.

00:14:03.820 --> 00:14:07.330 align:middle line:84%
It's a very, very big
thing, just helping,

00:14:07.330 --> 00:14:08.810 align:middle line:90%
contributing with the world.

00:14:08.810 --> 00:14:09.610 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:14:09.610 --> 00:14:12.940 align:middle line:84%
>>MINERO: So just trying to
understand the value of OK,

00:14:12.940 --> 00:14:14.830 align:middle line:84%
I have some resources,
or I produce

00:14:14.830 --> 00:14:17.020 align:middle line:90%
some resources in my work.

00:14:17.020 --> 00:14:21.690 align:middle line:84%
Is it OK for me to give
them to somebody else,

00:14:21.690 --> 00:14:23.320 align:middle line:90%
for contribution?

00:14:23.320 --> 00:14:26.770 align:middle line:84%
And how much, or how
much of my capacity

00:14:26.770 --> 00:14:28.840 align:middle line:84%
to be able to contribute
with the world?

00:14:28.840 --> 00:14:30.340 align:middle line:84%
I say this because
of course, maybe,

00:14:30.340 --> 00:14:32.570 align:middle line:84%
for some people
this seems obvious.

00:14:32.570 --> 00:14:36.110 align:middle line:84%
But for other people,
they think, wait a second.

00:14:36.110 --> 00:14:38.860 align:middle line:84%
Whatever I produce,
I want to keep.

00:14:38.860 --> 00:14:43.230 align:middle line:84%
And to a certain extent,
when you leave the body--

00:14:43.230 --> 00:14:46.250 align:middle line:84%
I'm here going to start mixing
a lot of topics, but that's OK?

00:14:46.250 --> 00:14:46.360 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: That's fine.

00:14:46.360 --> 00:14:47.330 align:middle line:90%
Yeah, go for it.

00:14:47.330 --> 00:14:48.997 align:middle line:84%
>>MINERO: One of the
things that happens

00:14:48.997 --> 00:14:50.980 align:middle line:84%
is that you bump into
the spirit guides.

00:14:50.980 --> 00:14:52.720 align:middle line:84%
And then you start
realizing-- look,

00:14:52.720 --> 00:14:56.410 align:middle line:84%
these individuals are donating
so much of their resources,

00:14:56.410 --> 00:14:57.700 align:middle line:90%
time, knowledge--

00:14:57.700 --> 00:14:59.540 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes, energy.

00:14:59.540 --> 00:15:00.340 align:middle line:90%
>>MINERO: Energy.

00:15:00.340 --> 00:15:04.240 align:middle line:84%
And it's not like anybody's
paying them for that,

00:15:04.240 --> 00:15:06.850 align:middle line:84%
or somebody is telling them,
hey, you have to go help them.

00:15:06.850 --> 00:15:10.280 align:middle line:84%
So somehow, in the
evolution of the soul,

00:15:10.280 --> 00:15:13.000 align:middle line:84%
they learned at
some moment, look--

00:15:13.000 --> 00:15:16.133 align:middle line:84%
contribution, assistance
is a very big thing.

00:15:16.133 --> 00:15:17.550 align:middle line:84%
It's a very big
part of evolution.

00:15:17.550 --> 00:15:18.900 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:15:18.900 --> 00:15:22.190 align:middle line:84%
>>MINERO: So many people
are preparing themselves,

00:15:22.190 --> 00:15:25.040 align:middle line:84%
or are trying to
study and understand

00:15:25.040 --> 00:15:27.520 align:middle line:84%
more this idea of
contribution and assistance.

00:15:27.520 --> 00:15:29.270 align:middle line:84%
And when they come to
their physical life,

00:15:29.270 --> 00:15:31.470 align:middle line:84%
they're trying to
put it into practice.

00:15:31.470 --> 00:15:34.150 align:middle line:84%
So many of them
look like classes.

00:15:34.150 --> 00:15:37.100 align:middle line:84%
And some of them, they feel
like a university class.

00:15:37.100 --> 00:15:41.660 align:middle line:84%
Some of the experiences I had,
they look a little bit like--

00:15:41.660 --> 00:15:44.738 align:middle line:84%
I'm going to used the physical
words, because we really

00:15:44.738 --> 00:15:45.655 align:middle line:90%
don't have any others.

00:15:45.655 --> 00:15:46.280 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:15:46.280 --> 00:15:47.750 align:middle line:84%
>>MINERO: They
look like a lecture

00:15:47.750 --> 00:15:49.520 align:middle line:90%
where somebody was lecturing.

00:15:49.520 --> 00:15:53.000 align:middle line:84%
But there wasn't like a
board and an auditorium

00:15:53.000 --> 00:15:54.670 align:middle line:90%
and people sitting in chairs.

00:15:54.670 --> 00:15:59.240 align:middle line:84%
But everybody standing in
space, and there is this area

00:15:59.240 --> 00:16:00.860 align:middle line:90%
where this is happening.

00:16:00.860 --> 00:16:02.990 align:middle line:84%
And as the person
is transmitting

00:16:02.990 --> 00:16:07.250 align:middle line:84%
the energy and the
information of their lecture,

00:16:07.250 --> 00:16:11.230 align:middle line:84%
in the space, as you are
getting close to the classroom

00:16:11.230 --> 00:16:15.500 align:middle line:84%
or of this space, you can see
a bubble of a different color,

00:16:15.500 --> 00:16:16.940 align:middle line:90%
to a certain extent.

00:16:16.940 --> 00:16:21.000 align:middle line:84%
And as you get close to it,
before entering this bubble,

00:16:21.000 --> 00:16:23.780 align:middle line:84%
if you're trying to understand
what they are saying,

00:16:23.780 --> 00:16:26.660 align:middle line:84%
it almost sounds as if you're
on the other side of the door

00:16:26.660 --> 00:16:29.927 align:middle line:84%
when something is going
on in the room inside.

00:16:29.927 --> 00:16:31.760 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Right, and
you're listening, yeah.

00:16:31.760 --> 00:16:32.480 align:middle line:84%
>>MINERO: But the
moment that you

00:16:32.480 --> 00:16:34.610 align:middle line:84%
put your head through
the bubble, everything

00:16:34.610 --> 00:16:35.720 align:middle line:90%
is very clear.

00:16:35.720 --> 00:16:37.220 align:middle line:84%
You can hear very
well what is it

00:16:37.220 --> 00:16:39.740 align:middle line:90%
that the person is explaining.

00:16:39.740 --> 00:16:42.050 align:middle line:84%
And some of the interesting
things about those

00:16:42.050 --> 00:16:46.030 align:middle line:84%
experiences-- it's not
just that you get an idea

00:16:46.030 --> 00:16:49.250 align:middle line:84%
of organization,
of how the cosmos--

00:16:49.250 --> 00:16:50.930 align:middle line:84%
for lack of a
better word-- seems

00:16:50.930 --> 00:16:54.200 align:middle line:84%
to be more organized
than random.

00:16:54.200 --> 00:16:55.010 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:16:55.010 --> 00:16:58.100 align:middle line:84%
>>MINERO: So people are
preparing themselves.

00:16:58.100 --> 00:17:00.620 align:middle line:84%
This is one lesson
or two lessons.

00:17:00.620 --> 00:17:02.150 align:middle line:84%
And then next time,
they will have

00:17:02.150 --> 00:17:03.830 align:middle line:90%
another one and another one.

00:17:03.830 --> 00:17:07.772 align:middle line:84%
So there is this
organization in it.

00:17:07.772 --> 00:17:09.230 align:middle line:84%
And second, you
also see that there

00:17:09.230 --> 00:17:11.800 align:middle line:84%
are people, like for
example, this lecturer, who

00:17:11.800 --> 00:17:13.669 align:middle line:84%
are investing in
this organization

00:17:13.669 --> 00:17:17.089 align:middle line:84%
and who are trying,
even outside the body,

00:17:17.089 --> 00:17:20.119 align:middle line:84%
to contribute so as to give more
knowledge to this individual

00:17:20.119 --> 00:17:24.619 align:middle line:84%
so that they can go and apply
it and improve in that fashion.

00:17:24.619 --> 00:17:26.359 align:middle line:90%
So those are eye-opening.

00:17:26.359 --> 00:17:30.810 align:middle line:84%
Besides that, from a
personal perspective, what

00:17:30.810 --> 00:17:33.200 align:middle line:84%
is interesting is
you also arrive

00:17:33.200 --> 00:17:36.000 align:middle line:84%
at some of those activities
or some of those--

00:17:36.000 --> 00:17:39.040 align:middle line:84%
yeah, activities are going
on in those dimensions.

00:17:39.040 --> 00:17:41.960 align:middle line:84%
And sometimes you
realize, wait a second.

00:17:41.960 --> 00:17:44.450 align:middle line:90%
I was here before I was born.

00:17:44.450 --> 00:17:49.333 align:middle line:84%
I was part of the ones that
studied here before I was born.

00:17:49.333 --> 00:17:51.500 align:middle line:84%
I have been in some where
I didn't get that feeling.

00:17:51.500 --> 00:17:53.940 align:middle line:84%
But I was in some where I
realized, wait a second,

00:17:53.940 --> 00:17:54.740 align:middle line:90%
I was here.

00:17:54.740 --> 00:17:55.700 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: I've been here.

00:17:55.700 --> 00:17:57.033 align:middle line:90%
>>MINERO: I've been here before.

00:17:57.033 --> 00:18:00.140 align:middle line:84%
And I was here before,
before I was born.

00:18:00.140 --> 00:18:02.470 align:middle line:84%
And that, really, is
also very eye-opening--

00:18:02.470 --> 00:18:02.760 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:18:02.760 --> 00:18:03.935 align:middle line:84%
>>MINERO: It gives you
a sense of continuity

00:18:03.935 --> 00:18:05.387 align:middle line:90%
with regards to your soul.

00:18:05.387 --> 00:18:07.845 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Well, and in purpose
and intention, and to know--

00:18:07.845 --> 00:18:08.360 align:middle line:90%
>>MINERO: Exactly.

00:18:08.360 --> 00:18:09.443 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: You're on track.

00:18:09.443 --> 00:18:11.990 align:middle line:84%
You are doing what you
contracted to do for yourself.

00:18:11.990 --> 00:18:13.055 align:middle line:84%
>>MINERO: Or at
least trying to do.

00:18:13.055 --> 00:18:14.388 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah, or trying to do.

00:18:14.388 --> 00:18:16.490 align:middle line:84%
Yeah, and time operates
very differently there.

00:18:16.490 --> 00:18:18.650 align:middle line:84%
And I often talk about
this with people.

00:18:18.650 --> 00:18:22.040 align:middle line:84%
Time here is such a
constraining thing, often.

00:18:22.040 --> 00:18:24.980 align:middle line:84%
It's such a source
of frustration,

00:18:24.980 --> 00:18:28.550 align:middle line:84%
because it doesn't move
fast enough or whatever.

00:18:28.550 --> 00:18:31.130 align:middle line:84%
It's just too slow
for manifestation.

00:18:31.130 --> 00:18:33.230 align:middle line:84%
But when you go into
these other domains,

00:18:33.230 --> 00:18:35.270 align:middle line:90%
time isn't relevant in that way.

00:18:35.270 --> 00:18:38.080 align:middle line:84%
>>MINERO: Yes, yes, it's
completely different.

00:18:38.080 --> 00:18:41.300 align:middle line:84%
And interesting
that I just recently

00:18:41.300 --> 00:18:43.050 align:middle line:90%
was having this conversation.

00:18:43.050 --> 00:18:44.510 align:middle line:84%
But it seems, to
a certain extent,

00:18:44.510 --> 00:18:46.160 align:middle line:84%
that the physical
reality obviously

00:18:46.160 --> 00:18:49.070 align:middle line:84%
has all these rules
that are constricting

00:18:49.070 --> 00:18:55.950 align:middle line:84%
and that we have to abide by--
gravity, time, everything.

00:18:55.950 --> 00:18:59.900 align:middle line:84%
But it almost seems
like the school.

00:18:59.900 --> 00:19:02.960 align:middle line:84%
And when kids go
to school, they are

00:19:02.960 --> 00:19:07.580 align:middle line:84%
now in this room for six hours
listening to these teacher

00:19:07.580 --> 00:19:08.880 align:middle line:90%
lecture about whatever.

00:19:08.880 --> 00:19:12.570 align:middle line:84%
And they obviously would
rather be running the park--

00:19:12.570 --> 00:19:13.370 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:19:13.370 --> 00:19:16.080 align:middle line:84%
>>MINERO: And
sleeping until 1:00 AM

00:19:16.080 --> 00:19:18.080 align:middle line:84%
because they were watching
a movie or something,

00:19:18.080 --> 00:19:19.740 align:middle line:90%
going to bed until later.

00:19:19.740 --> 00:19:21.690 align:middle line:84%
So obviously, the
school is restricting.

00:19:21.690 --> 00:19:22.490 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:19:22.490 --> 00:19:26.510 align:middle line:84%
>>MINERO: But what it seems like
it takes away in restriction,

00:19:26.510 --> 00:19:28.110 align:middle line:90%
it's giving--

00:19:28.110 --> 00:19:33.830 align:middle line:84%
on the other hand, it's helping
you towards learning faster.

00:19:33.830 --> 00:19:37.260 align:middle line:84%
Like it's clipping your
wings on the one side.

00:19:37.260 --> 00:19:40.490 align:middle line:84%
But on the other side, it's
helping you to move faster

00:19:40.490 --> 00:19:41.900 align:middle line:90%
to reach certain goals.

00:19:41.900 --> 00:19:43.567 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Right, well,
that's a good way

00:19:43.567 --> 00:19:45.750 align:middle line:84%
to put it because kids don't
see it that way at all.

00:19:45.750 --> 00:19:47.945 align:middle line:84%
>>MINERO: I still have a
hard time seeing that way.

00:19:47.945 --> 00:19:50.450 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And it's
interesting, because you're

00:19:50.450 --> 00:19:54.080 align:middle line:84%
talking about these out-of-body
experiences in such a way that,

00:19:54.080 --> 00:19:55.190 align:middle line:90%
of course, is fascinating.

00:19:55.190 --> 00:19:56.648 align:middle line:84%
And everyone thinks,
oh my god, I'd

00:19:56.648 --> 00:19:59.690 align:middle line:84%
love to learn how to do
that, just for the sake

00:19:59.690 --> 00:20:01.320 align:middle line:90%
of having the experience.

00:20:01.320 --> 00:20:04.340 align:middle line:84%
Well, coming up shortly--
it's actually already arrived,

00:20:04.340 --> 00:20:06.730 align:middle line:84%
but soon to be at
every theater near you,

00:20:06.730 --> 00:20:11.060 align:middle line:84%
like in a box in your home,
is virtual reality technology,

00:20:11.060 --> 00:20:14.180 align:middle line:84%
which is going to be a
really interesting interface.

00:20:14.180 --> 00:20:16.820 align:middle line:84%
But in a way-- and I know
I tend to always sound

00:20:16.820 --> 00:20:18.060 align:middle line:90%
like I'm bashing technology.

00:20:18.060 --> 00:20:18.860 align:middle line:90%
I'm not.

00:20:18.860 --> 00:20:20.490 align:middle line:90%
It has amazing applications.

00:20:20.490 --> 00:20:25.310 align:middle line:84%
But what happens when people
can just put on a headset

00:20:25.310 --> 00:20:27.020 align:middle line:84%
and start having
these experiences?

00:20:27.020 --> 00:20:29.930 align:middle line:84%
Is that something that you
think might trigger a deeper

00:20:29.930 --> 00:20:31.760 align:middle line:90%
desire for us to explore?

00:20:31.760 --> 00:20:34.010 align:middle line:84%
Or maybe become a
substitute for our desire

00:20:34.010 --> 00:20:36.250 align:middle line:90%
to invest in ourselves?

00:20:36.250 --> 00:20:37.250 align:middle line:90%
>>MINERO: Good question.

00:20:37.250 --> 00:20:40.960 align:middle line:84%
I think that it's going to
boil down to the individual,

00:20:40.960 --> 00:20:41.760 align:middle line:90%
probably as always.

00:20:41.760 --> 00:20:42.560 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:20:42.560 --> 00:20:45.650 align:middle line:84%
>>MINERO: Some people will
probably get lost in that

00:20:45.650 --> 00:20:50.270 align:middle line:84%
and really not want to deal
with this reality anymore.

00:20:50.270 --> 00:20:52.850 align:middle line:84%
In other people, the ones that
are more inquisitive and they

00:20:52.850 --> 00:20:55.490 align:middle line:84%
have this drive to
improve themselves,

00:20:55.490 --> 00:20:57.920 align:middle line:84%
they're going to try to see
that as an opportunity--

00:20:57.920 --> 00:20:58.880 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:20:58.880 --> 00:21:00.350 align:middle line:84%
>>MINERO: To understand
themselves better.

00:21:00.350 --> 00:21:02.150 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Right, and then
use that as a launching pad

00:21:02.150 --> 00:21:03.690 align:middle line:84%
into their own
organic experience.

00:21:03.690 --> 00:21:04.490 align:middle line:90%
>>MINERO: Exactly.

00:21:04.490 --> 00:21:06.540 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Yeah, I would
agree with you on that.

00:21:06.540 --> 00:21:07.430 align:middle line:90%
I just popped in.

00:21:07.430 --> 00:21:08.360 align:middle line:84%
I just thought I
would bring that up.

00:21:08.360 --> 00:21:08.930 align:middle line:84%
>>MINERO: Yeah, no,
no, no, good question.

00:21:08.930 --> 00:21:10.513 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Because
it's coming up soon.

00:21:10.513 --> 00:21:13.700 align:middle line:84%
And people love--
they love dreams.

00:21:13.700 --> 00:21:16.370 align:middle line:84%
People love, if they've
had the opportunities,

00:21:16.370 --> 00:21:17.820 align:middle line:90%
out-of-body experiences.

00:21:17.820 --> 00:21:21.120 align:middle line:84%
So let's go on further
to experiments, because--

00:21:21.120 --> 00:21:24.020 align:middle line:84%
OK, this is one thing that I
heard in one of your lectures

00:21:24.020 --> 00:21:27.830 align:middle line:84%
that I was very curious
about, that sometimes when

00:21:27.830 --> 00:21:32.180 align:middle line:84%
you have left the
body, there is someone

00:21:32.180 --> 00:21:35.360 align:middle line:84%
in that field or
dimension you're in,

00:21:35.360 --> 00:21:37.970 align:middle line:84%
or even a human being
in this dimension,

00:21:37.970 --> 00:21:40.110 align:middle line:84%
that will detect
you, can see you.

00:21:40.110 --> 00:21:40.910 align:middle line:90%
>>MINERO: OK.

00:21:40.910 --> 00:21:43.130 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Let's talk
about that phenomena.

00:21:43.130 --> 00:21:43.980 align:middle line:90%
>>MINERO: Outside the body, yes.

00:21:43.980 --> 00:21:45.320 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Yeah, when
you're out of the body.

00:21:45.320 --> 00:21:47.278 align:middle line:84%
And then I'll bring an
example, another example

00:21:47.278 --> 00:21:49.110 align:middle line:90%
that I found fascinating.

00:21:49.110 --> 00:21:51.170 align:middle line:84%
Let's talk about that,
where you're out of body,

00:21:51.170 --> 00:21:52.390 align:middle line:90%
and they can see you.

00:21:52.390 --> 00:21:55.580 align:middle line:84%
>>MINERO: Sure, yeah, because
basically and in essence,

00:21:55.580 --> 00:21:59.510 align:middle line:84%
that person that can see you,
or that non-physical entity

00:21:59.510 --> 00:22:02.240 align:middle line:84%
or being that can see
you, they can see you

00:22:02.240 --> 00:22:04.880 align:middle line:84%
because at this moment you are
basically in the same dimension

00:22:04.880 --> 00:22:07.190 align:middle line:84%
as they are, in the
same plane as they are.

00:22:07.190 --> 00:22:08.520 align:middle line:90%
And you can interact with them.

00:22:08.520 --> 00:22:12.860 align:middle line:84%
You can talk to them, depending
on their level of consciousness

00:22:12.860 --> 00:22:16.910 align:middle line:84%
and your level of
consciousness, as always.

00:22:16.910 --> 00:22:18.860 align:middle line:84%
And this is even
why, sometimes when

00:22:18.860 --> 00:22:20.960 align:middle line:84%
people have out-of-body
experiences, for example,

00:22:20.960 --> 00:22:23.450 align:middle line:84%
they meet relatives that
have already passed away.

00:22:23.450 --> 00:22:24.250 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:22:24.250 --> 00:22:27.020 align:middle line:84%
>>MINERO: So the relative that
already passed away is there,

00:22:27.020 --> 00:22:28.190 align:middle line:90%
is in that dimension.

00:22:28.190 --> 00:22:29.330 align:middle line:90%
And you can find them.

00:22:29.330 --> 00:22:33.840 align:middle line:84%
And this actually helps people a
lot, because it helps them to--

00:22:33.840 --> 00:22:35.930 align:middle line:84%
especially with the
grieving process,

00:22:35.930 --> 00:22:37.760 align:middle line:84%
or if they were
missing them a lot,

00:22:37.760 --> 00:22:41.960 align:middle line:84%
they realize, or they can verify
by themselves in the practice,

00:22:41.960 --> 00:22:43.470 align:middle line:90%
my relative is there.

00:22:43.470 --> 00:22:44.270 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:22:44.270 --> 00:22:44.570 align:middle line:90%
>>MINERO: [INAUDIBLE]

00:22:44.570 --> 00:22:46.653 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: I remember meeting
with my mother there.

00:22:46.653 --> 00:22:48.090 align:middle line:90%
And then, boom, it freed her.

00:22:48.090 --> 00:22:49.790 align:middle line:84%
She didn't have to keep
coming back, because she said,

00:22:49.790 --> 00:22:52.322 align:middle line:84%
it's very tiring to come in
and try to meet with you guys.

00:22:52.322 --> 00:22:53.530 align:middle line:90%
>>MINERO: Check on you, yeah.

00:22:53.530 --> 00:22:54.210 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:22:54.210 --> 00:22:55.418 align:middle line:90%
>>MINERO: Yeah, That as well.

00:22:55.418 --> 00:22:56.570 align:middle line:90%
It allows them to move on.

00:22:56.570 --> 00:22:58.153 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:22:58.153 --> 00:23:00.320 align:middle line:84%
>>MINERO: And at the same
time, the physical person,

00:23:00.320 --> 00:23:02.720 align:middle line:84%
because sometimes there
are people who stayed

00:23:02.720 --> 00:23:04.070 align:middle line:90%
with that in their own life.

00:23:04.070 --> 00:23:07.420 align:middle line:84%
And after that they are free
to continue their trajectory.

00:23:07.420 --> 00:23:08.220 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:23:08.220 --> 00:23:10.350 align:middle line:84%
So now you're out of
body, they're in body.

00:23:10.350 --> 00:23:12.590 align:middle line:90%
And they can see you.

00:23:12.590 --> 00:23:13.520 align:middle line:90%
Has that happened?

00:23:13.520 --> 00:23:14.000 align:middle line:90%
>>MINERO: Oh, yes.

00:23:14.000 --> 00:23:14.240 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:23:14.240 --> 00:23:15.410 align:middle line:90%
That's what I'm referring to.

00:23:15.410 --> 00:23:16.785 align:middle line:84%
>>MINERO: That
also has happened.

00:23:16.785 --> 00:23:20.090 align:middle line:84%
That is a little
bit more difficult,

00:23:20.090 --> 00:23:23.810 align:middle line:84%
because really, the person
needs to have a lot of intuition

00:23:23.810 --> 00:23:26.120 align:middle line:84%
or clairvoyance
or clear audience.

00:23:26.120 --> 00:23:29.470 align:middle line:90%
They might be able to hear you.

00:23:29.470 --> 00:23:31.870 align:middle line:84%
And it really boils down
to whether the person

00:23:31.870 --> 00:23:37.040 align:middle line:84%
at that moment can perceive
something, the physical person,

00:23:37.040 --> 00:23:39.680 align:middle line:84%
I mean, when you are
outside the body.

00:23:39.680 --> 00:23:42.710 align:middle line:84%
And obviously, many
people are psychic.

00:23:42.710 --> 00:23:47.660 align:middle line:84%
Many people have abilities
that go beyond the five senses.

00:23:47.660 --> 00:23:51.020 align:middle line:84%
What happens many times-- and
I many times mention this.

00:23:51.020 --> 00:23:53.780 align:middle line:84%
What happens many times is
that the physical reality

00:23:53.780 --> 00:23:56.570 align:middle line:84%
attracts our attention
to the physical reality.

00:23:56.570 --> 00:24:00.530 align:middle line:84%
And normally, most people don't
go around with their antennas

00:24:00.530 --> 00:24:04.970 align:middle line:84%
on, trying to see
who is around them.

00:24:04.970 --> 00:24:08.477 align:middle line:84%
Even the people who are
listening to us at this moment,

00:24:08.477 --> 00:24:09.560 align:middle line:90%
they could ask themselves.

00:24:09.560 --> 00:24:15.470 align:middle line:84%
During this 20 minutes that
we've been in this chat here,

00:24:15.470 --> 00:24:17.000 align:middle line:90%
who has been standing around me?

00:24:17.000 --> 00:24:17.900 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:24:17.900 --> 00:24:20.570 align:middle line:84%
>>MINERO: Probably this
is an idea or a question

00:24:20.570 --> 00:24:21.950 align:middle line:90%
that we haven't asked ourselves.

00:24:21.950 --> 00:24:24.070 align:middle line:84%
But it doesn't mean that
there was somebody there.

00:24:24.070 --> 00:24:25.640 align:middle line:90%
I don't want to put anybody--

00:24:25.640 --> 00:24:27.030 align:middle line:90%
I don't want to scare anybody.

00:24:27.030 --> 00:24:28.408 align:middle line:90%
But there could have been.

00:24:28.408 --> 00:24:29.700 align:middle line:90%
And we could have perceived it.

00:24:29.700 --> 00:24:33.390 align:middle line:84%
It's just simply that we don't
go around with our antennas on.

00:24:33.390 --> 00:24:36.400 align:middle line:90%
So it is possible, yes.

00:24:36.400 --> 00:24:38.210 align:middle line:84%
And sometimes you
can even perceive,

00:24:38.210 --> 00:24:41.210 align:middle line:84%
in the energetic information
of the person that

00:24:41.210 --> 00:24:45.620 align:middle line:84%
is out there, a little bit their
intention, why they are there.

00:24:45.620 --> 00:24:49.490 align:middle line:84%
For example, oh, I miss
you, or I'm checking on you.

00:24:49.490 --> 00:24:54.560 align:middle line:84%
This would be a little bit
of a stronger connection.

00:24:54.560 --> 00:24:56.780 align:middle line:84%
This would be similar to
the example of when people

00:24:56.780 --> 00:24:58.910 align:middle line:84%
are in the middle of
the day and they start

00:24:58.910 --> 00:25:00.230 align:middle line:90%
thinking about a relative.

00:25:00.230 --> 00:25:02.940 align:middle line:84%
And the moment that the phone
sounds, they already know.

00:25:02.940 --> 00:25:03.740 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:25:03.740 --> 00:25:06.200 align:middle line:84%
>>MINERO: So this happens
almost with everybody

00:25:06.200 --> 00:25:08.250 align:middle line:90%
at some point in their life.

00:25:08.250 --> 00:25:12.680 align:middle line:84%
But if you are outside the body
and more focused on the person,

00:25:12.680 --> 00:25:14.210 align:middle line:84%
then that connection
is stronger.

00:25:14.210 --> 00:25:15.830 align:middle line:90%
And then it can be easily felt.

00:25:15.830 --> 00:25:17.170 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:25:17.170 --> 00:25:20.600 align:middle line:84%
OK, so now this is another
situation that may or may not

00:25:20.600 --> 00:25:21.440 align:middle line:90%
fall inside this.

00:25:21.440 --> 00:25:23.760 align:middle line:84%
But I've just found
it fascinating.

00:25:23.760 --> 00:25:26.330 align:middle line:84%
I interviewed a woman
named Andrea Perron, who

00:25:26.330 --> 00:25:27.808 align:middle line:90%
there have been--

00:25:27.808 --> 00:25:29.600 align:middle line:84%
what's it called, "The
Conjuring," I think,

00:25:29.600 --> 00:25:31.070 align:middle line:84%
is the horror movies
that have been

00:25:31.070 --> 00:25:33.087 align:middle line:90%
made about her family's life.

00:25:33.087 --> 00:25:34.170 align:middle line:90%
She's written three books.

00:25:34.170 --> 00:25:36.060 align:middle line:84%
And they lived in
a haunted house.

00:25:36.060 --> 00:25:39.590 align:middle line:84%
But one of the moments in
that I found so fascinating

00:25:39.590 --> 00:25:44.750 align:middle line:84%
is that as her mother was
standing in the kitchen,

00:25:44.750 --> 00:25:48.620 align:middle line:84%
looking into the dining
room, she saw the family

00:25:48.620 --> 00:25:50.960 align:middle line:90%
in another dimension--

00:25:50.960 --> 00:25:54.140 align:middle line:84%
that lived there in
another period of time--

00:25:54.140 --> 00:25:55.760 align:middle line:90%
at the table.

00:25:55.760 --> 00:25:58.280 align:middle line:84%
The woman, the
mother at the table

00:25:58.280 --> 00:26:02.180 align:middle line:84%
turned around and looked
at her, looking at her.

00:26:02.180 --> 00:26:03.140 align:middle line:90%
>>MINERO: Right.

00:26:03.140 --> 00:26:05.060 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So in this
other time and dimension,

00:26:05.060 --> 00:26:07.340 align:middle line:84%
this woman was aware that
Andrea's mother was now

00:26:07.340 --> 00:26:10.620 align:middle line:84%
standing there looking at
her in that same space.

00:26:10.620 --> 00:26:11.570 align:middle line:90%
>>MINERO: Right.

00:26:11.570 --> 00:26:14.120 align:middle line:84%
Not the most common thing,
but certainly possible.

00:26:14.120 --> 00:26:14.920 align:middle line:90%
Certainly.

00:26:14.920 --> 00:26:16.698 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Yeah, I
found it fascinating,

00:26:16.698 --> 00:26:18.740 align:middle line:84%
because talk about getting
rid of time and space.

00:26:18.740 --> 00:26:19.930 align:middle line:90%
>>MINERO: Exactly.

00:26:19.930 --> 00:26:22.550 align:middle line:84%
You see there the psychic
abilities in all of these

00:26:22.550 --> 00:26:23.850 align:middle line:90%
ideas, of non-locality--

00:26:23.850 --> 00:26:24.350 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:26:24.350 --> 00:26:26.820 align:middle line:84%
>>MINERO: And of the fact
that they don't respect time.

00:26:26.820 --> 00:26:32.180 align:middle line:84%
So you can go back and forth
and have these experiences.

00:26:32.180 --> 00:26:34.726 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: You've done a
ton of experiments, right?

00:26:34.726 --> 00:26:35.560 align:middle line:90%
A lot.

00:26:35.560 --> 00:26:37.415 align:middle line:84%
>>MINERO: I would
say a few, yes.

00:26:37.415 --> 00:26:39.140 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: OK, so
let's talk about--

00:26:39.140 --> 00:26:40.640 align:middle line:84%
first of all, you
guide other people

00:26:40.640 --> 00:26:41.640 align:middle line:90%
through this process too.

00:26:41.640 --> 00:26:41.990 align:middle line:90%
>>MINERO: Yes.

00:26:41.990 --> 00:26:43.180 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: You help
other people do this.

00:26:43.180 --> 00:26:43.550 align:middle line:90%
>>MINERO: Yes.

00:26:43.550 --> 00:26:45.770 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So let's talk
about the nature of some

00:26:45.770 --> 00:26:47.280 align:middle line:90%
of the experiments you've done.

00:26:47.280 --> 00:26:48.080 align:middle line:90%
>>MINERO: OK.

00:26:48.080 --> 00:26:49.220 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Toward what end?

00:26:49.220 --> 00:26:51.200 align:middle line:90%
>>MINERO: OK.

00:26:51.200 --> 00:26:53.840 align:middle line:84%
Maybe one of the latest
ones that I was working on

00:26:53.840 --> 00:26:56.370 align:middle line:90%
was trying to--

00:26:56.370 --> 00:26:59.030 align:middle line:84%
especially for more the
scientific community,

00:26:59.030 --> 00:27:02.450 align:middle line:84%
trying to put data that
would quantify the benefits

00:27:02.450 --> 00:27:03.950 align:middle line:90%
of the out-of-body experience--

00:27:03.950 --> 00:27:04.750 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:27:04.750 --> 00:27:08.280 align:middle line:84%
>>MINERO: Because many people
have heard how when you leave

00:27:08.280 --> 00:27:09.080 align:middle line:90%
the body--

00:27:09.080 --> 00:27:11.480 align:middle line:84%
similar to the
near-death experience--

00:27:11.480 --> 00:27:12.890 align:middle line:90%
you lose the fear of death.

00:27:12.890 --> 00:27:14.510 align:middle line:90%
You can meet deceased relatives.

00:27:14.510 --> 00:27:16.670 align:middle line:84%
You can understand
your life purpose.

00:27:16.670 --> 00:27:19.872 align:middle line:90%
You become more humane.

00:27:19.872 --> 00:27:21.080 align:middle line:90%
You connect more with people.

00:27:21.080 --> 00:27:23.730 align:middle line:84%
You want to contribute more,
like I was saying before.

00:27:23.730 --> 00:27:27.590 align:middle line:84%
That person also, many times,
becomes more confident,

00:27:27.590 --> 00:27:28.400 align:middle line:90%
healthier.

00:27:28.400 --> 00:27:31.520 align:middle line:84%
So there are a lot
of different effects

00:27:31.520 --> 00:27:33.157 align:middle line:84%
that come to people
when they have

00:27:33.157 --> 00:27:35.740 align:middle line:84%
both the out-of-body experience
and the near-death experience.

00:27:35.740 --> 00:27:37.800 align:middle line:84%
It's just that with the
out-of-body experience,

00:27:37.800 --> 00:27:39.740 align:middle line:84%
you don't have to go through
the near-death part--

00:27:39.740 --> 00:27:40.540 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:27:40.540 --> 00:27:41.780 align:middle line:90%
>>MINERO: Which, it helps.

00:27:41.780 --> 00:27:43.430 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: It can
have its hazards.

00:27:43.430 --> 00:27:47.480 align:middle line:84%
>>MINERO: Yes, it can have
its drawbacks there, indeed.

00:27:47.480 --> 00:27:50.990 align:middle line:84%
But this is something
that many people report,

00:27:50.990 --> 00:27:52.250 align:middle line:90%
you hear from many people.

00:27:52.250 --> 00:27:55.910 align:middle line:84%
And what I was trying to do
is I was trying to understand,

00:27:55.910 --> 00:27:57.690 align:middle line:90%
how large is the benefit?

00:27:57.690 --> 00:28:00.350 align:middle line:84%
And does it really
exist, in the sense

00:28:00.350 --> 00:28:04.100 align:middle line:84%
that maybe we are
hearing from some people

00:28:04.100 --> 00:28:04.990 align:middle line:90%
about those benefits.

00:28:04.990 --> 00:28:07.490 align:middle line:84%
But maybe other people who are
having the experiences, maybe

00:28:07.490 --> 00:28:09.050 align:middle line:90%
they don't have the benefits.

00:28:09.050 --> 00:28:12.860 align:middle line:84%
So is it really
beneficial or not?

00:28:12.860 --> 00:28:16.290 align:middle line:84%
And besides that, I
had read this study.

00:28:16.290 --> 00:28:18.920 align:middle line:84%
I think it's Kenneth
Starr, who also studies

00:28:18.920 --> 00:28:23.570 align:middle line:84%
near-death experiences, who have
done research on the people who

00:28:23.570 --> 00:28:25.910 align:middle line:84%
hear about near-death
experiences,

00:28:25.910 --> 00:28:28.550 align:middle line:84%
and how those individuals
who hear about near-death

00:28:28.550 --> 00:28:31.910 align:middle line:84%
experiences, they start to
report the same benefits

00:28:31.910 --> 00:28:34.790 align:middle line:84%
as the people who have had
the near-death experiences,

00:28:34.790 --> 00:28:36.520 align:middle line:84%
even though they
haven't had them.

00:28:36.520 --> 00:28:38.000 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: OK, so
that's some kind

00:28:38.000 --> 00:28:39.410 align:middle line:90%
of entanglement going on there.

00:28:39.410 --> 00:28:42.020 align:middle line:84%
>>MINERO: Entanglement,
but also at the same time,

00:28:42.020 --> 00:28:45.840 align:middle line:84%
it probably happens because
they are hearing from several

00:28:45.840 --> 00:28:46.640 align:middle line:90%
people--

00:28:46.640 --> 00:28:49.100 align:middle line:84%
you don't die when you
pass away, and I lived it.

00:28:49.100 --> 00:28:52.160 align:middle line:84%
And then they start, maybe we
could say, to believe it more

00:28:52.160 --> 00:28:53.280 align:middle line:90%
or to incorporate it more.

00:28:53.280 --> 00:28:54.080 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:28:54.080 --> 00:28:55.340 align:middle line:84%
>>MINERO: And then
that helps them to--

00:28:55.340 --> 00:28:58.100 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: To get comfortable
with the notion for themselves.

00:28:58.100 --> 00:28:59.570 align:middle line:90%
>>MINERO: Exactly.

00:28:59.570 --> 00:29:03.030 align:middle line:10%
So I thought OK, let me also
study-- because obviously,

00:29:03.030 --> 00:29:06.148 align:middle line:10%
as you said, we give classes
on out-of-body experiences.

00:29:06.148 --> 00:29:07.440 align:middle line:10%
And some people leave the body.

00:29:07.440 --> 00:29:09.950 align:middle line:10%
Other people maybe,
they go because they

00:29:09.950 --> 00:29:11.920 align:middle line:10%
are interested in that.

00:29:11.920 --> 00:29:14.050 align:middle line:84%
And they just want to find
out a little bit more.

00:29:14.050 --> 00:29:14.883 align:middle line:90%
They don't practice.

00:29:14.883 --> 00:29:16.330 align:middle line:90%
And they don't leave the body.

00:29:16.330 --> 00:29:19.250 align:middle line:84%
And then I was thinking,
do those people also

00:29:19.250 --> 00:29:21.470 align:middle line:84%
start to have the same
benefits as the ones that

00:29:21.470 --> 00:29:24.200 align:middle line:84%
have the out-of-body
experience, or just by listening

00:29:24.200 --> 00:29:27.140 align:middle line:84%
to somebody else talk about
their out-of-body experiences?

00:29:27.140 --> 00:29:30.210 align:middle line:84%
So anyways, I was trying
to-- or I did, actually,

00:29:30.210 --> 00:29:33.930 align:middle line:84%
a survey trying to understand
the benefits of all of that.

00:29:33.930 --> 00:29:37.430 align:middle line:84%
And what I did, so as not to
try to reinvent the wheel,

00:29:37.430 --> 00:29:41.540 align:middle line:84%
is that I grabbed a psychology
test that already exists,

00:29:41.540 --> 00:29:44.750 align:middle line:84%
that has already been
standardized in universities,

00:29:44.750 --> 00:29:46.220 align:middle line:84%
and that has
already been applied

00:29:46.220 --> 00:29:48.240 align:middle line:90%
to the population at large.

00:29:48.240 --> 00:29:50.030 align:middle line:84%
And I applied that
one to the people

00:29:50.030 --> 00:29:51.800 align:middle line:84%
who have had
out-of-body experiences,

00:29:51.800 --> 00:29:54.740 align:middle line:84%
or the ones that have read
about out-of-body experiences.

00:29:54.740 --> 00:29:59.450 align:middle line:84%
My idea was that after
getting the results

00:29:59.450 --> 00:30:02.720 align:middle line:84%
from these individuals that have
had out-of-body experiences,

00:30:02.720 --> 00:30:05.810 align:middle line:84%
not only can I compare
it with the population

00:30:05.810 --> 00:30:08.130 align:middle line:84%
at large to see if there
are actually benefits,

00:30:08.130 --> 00:30:10.160 align:middle line:84%
but I can also compare
it between themselves.

00:30:10.160 --> 00:30:10.960 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:30:10.960 --> 00:30:13.730 align:middle line:84%
>>MINERO: And the results
were exactly what I expected.

00:30:13.730 --> 00:30:19.140 align:middle line:84%
They do report a higher increase
in comfortable with their life

00:30:19.140 --> 00:30:22.170 align:middle line:84%
and having a better purpose, and
understanding better their life

00:30:22.170 --> 00:30:24.720 align:middle line:84%
and having more
confidence, much more

00:30:24.720 --> 00:30:26.650 align:middle line:90%
than the population at large.

00:30:26.650 --> 00:30:28.380 align:middle line:84%
But also, the more
books the person

00:30:28.380 --> 00:30:30.170 align:middle line:84%
has read on out-of-body
experiences,

00:30:30.170 --> 00:30:32.970 align:middle line:84%
or the more out-of-body
experiences the person has had,

00:30:32.970 --> 00:30:35.010 align:middle line:90%
the larger the benefits.

00:30:35.010 --> 00:30:38.000 align:middle line:84%
And you can see that
numerically, statistically,

00:30:38.000 --> 00:30:40.140 align:middle line:84%
and starting to
quantify it, especially

00:30:40.140 --> 00:30:42.880 align:middle line:84%
for the scientific
population at large.

00:30:42.880 --> 00:30:43.680 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:30:43.680 --> 00:30:44.513 align:middle line:90%
Because you're both.

00:30:44.513 --> 00:30:46.510 align:middle line:84%
You're a scientist and
metaphysician, really.

00:30:46.510 --> 00:30:47.310 align:middle line:90%
>>MINERO: Yes.

00:30:47.310 --> 00:30:48.290 align:middle line:90%
Yes, exactly.

00:30:48.290 --> 00:30:49.870 align:middle line:90%
Yeah, I graduated in chemistry.

00:30:49.870 --> 00:30:53.500 align:middle line:84%
So yeah my background is
more on conventional science.

00:30:53.500 --> 00:30:54.300 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:30:54.300 --> 00:30:56.040 align:middle line:84%
So you're looking
to really find proof

00:30:56.040 --> 00:30:59.250 align:middle line:84%
positive in the scientific
realm about the value of this.

00:30:59.250 --> 00:31:00.780 align:middle line:84%
And that's an
important question.

00:31:00.780 --> 00:31:01.580 align:middle line:90%
>>MINERO: Indeed.

00:31:01.580 --> 00:31:04.260 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So you found that the
people that simply were exposed

00:31:04.260 --> 00:31:07.680 align:middle line:84%
to the truth of it or the
reality of it started gaining

00:31:07.680 --> 00:31:09.920 align:middle line:84%
those same lifts in
self-confidence--

00:31:09.920 --> 00:31:10.750 align:middle line:90%
>>MINERO: Exactly.

00:31:10.750 --> 00:31:13.200 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And dropping a
fear of death and all that--

00:31:13.200 --> 00:31:14.520 align:middle line:90%
thus education.

00:31:14.520 --> 00:31:16.950 align:middle line:84%
>>MINERO: Exactly, and
the deeper they go,

00:31:16.950 --> 00:31:18.330 align:middle line:90%
the greater the benefit.

00:31:18.330 --> 00:31:21.340 align:middle line:84%
And you start to see
it numerically very

00:31:21.340 --> 00:31:22.140 align:middle line:90%
clearly, actually.

00:31:22.140 --> 00:31:23.310 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: When you say
the deeper they go,

00:31:23.310 --> 00:31:24.930 align:middle line:84%
do you mean, for
example, if they

00:31:24.930 --> 00:31:27.090 align:middle line:84%
start reading books on the
subject and just really

00:31:27.090 --> 00:31:28.270 align:middle line:90%
delving in deeper?

00:31:28.270 --> 00:31:29.070 align:middle line:90%
>>MINERO: Indeed.

00:31:29.070 --> 00:31:30.390 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: If they
are not even having

00:31:30.390 --> 00:31:31.170 align:middle line:84%
their own out-of-body
experience.

00:31:31.170 --> 00:31:33.378 align:middle line:84%
>>MINERO: Even if they're
not having their own, yeah.

00:31:33.378 --> 00:31:35.080 align:middle line:84%
So for example, one
of my questions was,

00:31:35.080 --> 00:31:37.413 align:middle line:84%
how many books on out-of-body
experiences have you read?

00:31:37.413 --> 00:31:42.650 align:middle line:84%
So one to two, three to
five, six to 10, 11 to 20.

00:31:42.650 --> 00:31:45.060 align:middle line:84%
And obviously, the
ones that had read more

00:31:45.060 --> 00:31:48.690 align:middle line:84%
showed that greater benefit than
the ones that had read less.

00:31:48.690 --> 00:31:53.040 align:middle line:84%
And also I had asked them, how
many out-of-body experiences

00:31:53.040 --> 00:31:53.880 align:middle line:90%
have you had?

00:31:53.880 --> 00:31:58.080 align:middle line:84%
One to two, three to five,
more than 20, more than 50?

00:31:58.080 --> 00:32:00.870 align:middle line:84%
And the ones that have had more
out-of-body experiences also

00:32:00.870 --> 00:32:02.310 align:middle line:90%
show a greater benefit.

00:32:02.310 --> 00:32:03.930 align:middle line:90%
They live happier lives.

00:32:03.930 --> 00:32:06.150 align:middle line:84%
And another thing that
might be very interesting--

00:32:06.150 --> 00:32:11.350 align:middle line:84%
I have four sisters, and have a
lot of women around in my life.

00:32:11.350 --> 00:32:13.390 align:middle line:84%
And this, I don't
know exactly why.

00:32:13.390 --> 00:32:18.610 align:middle line:84%
But for some reason the benefit
seems to be greater in women

00:32:18.610 --> 00:32:19.410 align:middle line:90%
than in men.

00:32:19.410 --> 00:32:21.670 align:middle line:90%
So men also showed the benefit.

00:32:21.670 --> 00:32:24.240 align:middle line:84%
But women, maybe because
they're more sensitive--

00:32:24.240 --> 00:32:27.810 align:middle line:84%
the feminine sense--
the effect is compounded

00:32:27.810 --> 00:32:28.935 align:middle line:90%
and it tends to be greater.

00:32:28.935 --> 00:32:29.852 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Interesting.

00:32:29.852 --> 00:32:32.130 align:middle line:84%
And there might just be,
the nature of the feminine

00:32:32.130 --> 00:32:33.080 align:middle line:90%
is more receptive.

00:32:33.080 --> 00:32:33.880 align:middle line:90%
>>MINERO: Probably.

00:32:33.880 --> 00:32:35.357 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: More open by nature.

00:32:35.357 --> 00:32:35.570 align:middle line:90%
>>MINERO: Yeah, it is.

00:32:35.570 --> 00:32:38.010 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And so it could
just be that really basic

00:32:38.010 --> 00:32:42.510 align:middle line:84%
feminine trait that allows us
to, because women don't seem

00:32:42.510 --> 00:32:45.450 align:middle line:84%
to have the resistance to
embracing all kinds of novel

00:32:45.450 --> 00:32:48.000 align:middle line:84%
themes and ideas, where it
takes a while, a lot of times,

00:32:48.000 --> 00:32:49.740 align:middle line:84%
for their brothers
or sons or husbands

00:32:49.740 --> 00:32:51.930 align:middle line:90%
to take a look at something.

00:32:51.930 --> 00:32:53.400 align:middle line:90%
>>MINERO: Right, I agree.

00:32:53.400 --> 00:32:54.200 align:middle line:90%
I agree.

00:32:54.200 --> 00:32:55.685 align:middle line:90%
I absolutely have to agree.

00:32:55.685 --> 00:32:57.060 align:middle line:84%
I think also,
another factor that

00:32:57.060 --> 00:32:59.640 align:middle line:84%
contributes there is
just simply thinking

00:32:59.640 --> 00:33:01.650 align:middle line:84%
about the OBEs and
the physical body

00:33:01.650 --> 00:33:04.440 align:middle line:84%
that we have right now,
just generally speaking,

00:33:04.440 --> 00:33:07.260 align:middle line:84%
statistically speaking,
the body of the man

00:33:07.260 --> 00:33:09.465 align:middle line:84%
is a little bit
bigger and heavier.

00:33:09.465 --> 00:33:11.530 align:middle line:84%
And it's almost as if
we are more physical.

00:33:11.530 --> 00:33:12.330 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:33:12.330 --> 00:33:15.450 align:middle line:84%
>>MINERO: And women have
a body that is usually

00:33:15.450 --> 00:33:16.630 align:middle line:90%
a little bit lighter.

00:33:16.630 --> 00:33:20.010 align:middle line:84%
And then they have to
deal with a coat that

00:33:20.010 --> 00:33:21.742 align:middle line:90%
is not as thick as the men.

00:33:21.742 --> 00:33:23.700 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Right, the skin
isn't as thick, yeah.

00:33:23.700 --> 00:33:25.500 align:middle line:84%
>>MINERO: Yeah, the
skin is not thick.

00:33:25.500 --> 00:33:28.110 align:middle line:84%
I'm thinking here, if you
want to feel the temperature

00:33:28.110 --> 00:33:30.690 align:middle line:84%
outdoors, but you're
wearing these thick gloves

00:33:30.690 --> 00:33:32.822 align:middle line:90%
and this thick coat, it's hard.

00:33:32.822 --> 00:33:35.280 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So it could have to
do with our size and density.

00:33:35.280 --> 00:33:38.310 align:middle line:84%
And it literally is something
like hair on the body

00:33:38.310 --> 00:33:39.980 align:middle line:90%
and thickness of skin, even.

00:33:39.980 --> 00:33:40.245 align:middle line:90%
Interesting.

00:33:40.245 --> 00:33:41.970 align:middle line:84%
>>MINERO: I think it's a
contributing factor, yeah.

00:33:41.970 --> 00:33:42.887 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Interesting.

00:33:42.887 --> 00:33:47.400 align:middle line:84%
Let's get into the nature
of some of the experiences

00:33:47.400 --> 00:33:50.890 align:middle line:84%
that a lot of people would
divide into light and dark.

00:33:50.890 --> 00:33:51.690 align:middle line:90%
>>MINERO: OK.

00:33:51.690 --> 00:33:55.290 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: OK, because this is
an area that fascinates people.

00:33:55.290 --> 00:33:57.060 align:middle line:84%
And also, there's a
little fear around it,

00:33:57.060 --> 00:34:00.450 align:middle line:84%
like what if I tumble out
of my body and this happens,

00:34:00.450 --> 00:34:01.300 align:middle line:90%
versus that?

00:34:01.300 --> 00:34:03.740 align:middle line:84%
And I have been in
both situations.

00:34:03.740 --> 00:34:04.540 align:middle line:90%
>>MINERO: Right.

00:34:04.540 --> 00:34:06.180 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So let's
just start with some

00:34:06.180 --> 00:34:08.699 align:middle line:84%
of your own experiences and
the experiences of those

00:34:08.699 --> 00:34:11.492 align:middle line:84%
you've worked with,
where for some reason,

00:34:11.492 --> 00:34:13.409 align:middle line:84%
it seems when they get
out of the body they've

00:34:13.409 --> 00:34:17.060 align:middle line:84%
rolled into a dimension that is
not very friendly or welcoming.

00:34:17.060 --> 00:34:17.860 align:middle line:90%
>>MINERO: Right.

00:34:17.860 --> 00:34:20.429 align:middle line:84%
And I would even say,
even before I getting

00:34:20.429 --> 00:34:23.760 align:middle line:84%
to the dimension, just the
process of the disconnection

00:34:23.760 --> 00:34:26.000 align:middle line:84%
sometimes can be
a little easier--

00:34:26.000 --> 00:34:27.500 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Oh, let's
talk about that.

00:34:27.500 --> 00:34:28.739 align:middle line:84%
>>MINERO: Or a little
more traumatic.

00:34:28.739 --> 00:34:30.156 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: OK, let's
talk about it.

00:34:30.156 --> 00:34:32.550 align:middle line:84%
>>MINERO: Because
sometimes, for example,

00:34:32.550 --> 00:34:34.969 align:middle line:84%
just the sleep paralysis
that many people feel,

00:34:34.969 --> 00:34:36.719 align:middle line:84%
that in the middle of
the night sometimes,

00:34:36.719 --> 00:34:38.460 align:middle line:90%
they regain awareness.

00:34:38.460 --> 00:34:41.100 align:middle line:84%
And they're completely
still there.

00:34:41.100 --> 00:34:44.250 align:middle line:84%
And that, to a
certain extent, is

00:34:44.250 --> 00:34:46.260 align:middle line:84%
one of the most common
sensations of leaving

00:34:46.260 --> 00:34:48.300 align:middle line:90%
the body, the sleep paralysis.

00:34:48.300 --> 00:34:50.100 align:middle line:84%
But obviously at the
beginning, especially

00:34:50.100 --> 00:34:51.750 align:middle line:84%
if you don't have
the information,

00:34:51.750 --> 00:34:53.460 align:middle line:84%
your normal reaction
is, what is this?

00:34:53.460 --> 00:34:54.260 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Fear.

00:34:54.260 --> 00:34:55.350 align:middle line:90%
>>MINERO: Yeah, fear.

00:34:55.350 --> 00:34:56.560 align:middle line:90%
What happened to me--

00:34:56.560 --> 00:34:59.130 align:middle line:84%
many people that I know,
they were telling me

00:34:59.130 --> 00:35:02.820 align:middle line:84%
that the moment that they felt
that, their conclusion was,

00:35:02.820 --> 00:35:04.090 align:middle line:90%
look, I died.

00:35:04.090 --> 00:35:05.470 align:middle line:90%
I died in bed.

00:35:05.470 --> 00:35:06.270 align:middle line:90%
That's it.

00:35:06.270 --> 00:35:07.070 align:middle line:90%
Something happened.

00:35:07.070 --> 00:35:09.690 align:middle line:84%
And obviously, usually
the reaction to that

00:35:09.690 --> 00:35:14.850 align:middle line:84%
is not butterflies and
flowers, but it's fear.

00:35:14.850 --> 00:35:16.080 align:middle line:90%
Obviously, they didn't.

00:35:16.080 --> 00:35:18.290 align:middle line:90%
After some time they come back.

00:35:18.290 --> 00:35:20.605 align:middle line:84%
So what has happened
in those cases,

00:35:20.605 --> 00:35:21.980 align:middle line:84%
more than anything--
for example,

00:35:21.980 --> 00:35:23.930 align:middle line:84%
of the sleep
paralysis-- is that when

00:35:23.930 --> 00:35:25.620 align:middle line:84%
we're disconnecting
from the body,

00:35:25.620 --> 00:35:28.040 align:middle line:84%
depending on the speed in
which we are disconnecting

00:35:28.040 --> 00:35:30.630 align:middle line:84%
or how much we have
already disconnected,

00:35:30.630 --> 00:35:33.800 align:middle line:84%
in the case of the
sleep paralysis,

00:35:33.800 --> 00:35:36.050 align:middle line:84%
we have all of these
energetic connections that

00:35:36.050 --> 00:35:39.290 align:middle line:84%
connect our physical
body to the astral body.

00:35:39.290 --> 00:35:42.380 align:middle line:10%
But as we move away from
the physical body, all

00:35:42.380 --> 00:35:45.200 align:middle line:10%
of these connections
group themselves into one.

00:35:45.200 --> 00:35:47.480 align:middle line:10%
And now we don't have the
mini energetic connections

00:35:47.480 --> 00:35:48.540 align:middle line:10%
to the muscles.

00:35:48.540 --> 00:35:49.740 align:middle line:90%
So we cannot move them.

00:35:49.740 --> 00:35:51.560 align:middle line:84%
We cannot move
the physical body.

00:35:51.560 --> 00:35:53.540 align:middle line:84%
And this is basically
what happens in an OBE.

00:35:53.540 --> 00:35:55.210 align:middle line:90%
You can be at a distance.

00:35:55.210 --> 00:35:57.790 align:middle line:84%
You sometimes even feel
like your physical body is

00:35:57.790 --> 00:36:01.010 align:middle line:90%
lying in bed some miles away.

00:36:01.010 --> 00:36:04.510 align:middle line:84%
But it's still
immovable there, parked,

00:36:04.510 --> 00:36:07.850 align:middle line:84%
like a part that we left at
the supermarket or something.

00:36:07.850 --> 00:36:09.950 align:middle line:84%
So on this specific
night, the person

00:36:09.950 --> 00:36:12.640 align:middle line:84%
disconnected a
little bit more, lost

00:36:12.640 --> 00:36:15.950 align:middle line:84%
its mini energetic connection
to the motor functions,

00:36:15.950 --> 00:36:16.790 align:middle line:90%
to the muscles.

00:36:16.790 --> 00:36:17.590 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:36:17.590 --> 00:36:20.510 align:middle line:84%
>>MINERO: And now we have
started to return to the body.

00:36:20.510 --> 00:36:22.060 align:middle line:84%
Usually this happens
in the morning.

00:36:22.060 --> 00:36:25.550 align:middle line:84%
And in essence, they wake
up before the two bodies

00:36:25.550 --> 00:36:27.200 align:middle line:90%
have completely realigned.

00:36:27.200 --> 00:36:29.660 align:middle line:84%
And that's why they feel
the sleep paralysis.

00:36:29.660 --> 00:36:34.310 align:middle line:84%
If they stay still quiet,
in a matter of 20 seconds

00:36:34.310 --> 00:36:36.110 align:middle line:90%
the two bodies realign.

00:36:36.110 --> 00:36:41.390 align:middle line:84%
And now they can complain
to their spouse or scream

00:36:41.390 --> 00:36:42.840 align:middle line:90%
or whatever.

00:36:42.840 --> 00:36:48.170 align:middle line:84%
But also even if it happens to
any of the viewers, next time

00:36:48.170 --> 00:36:50.270 align:middle line:84%
that it happens,
try to stay calm.

00:36:50.270 --> 00:36:51.950 align:middle line:90%
Try to stay relaxed.

00:36:51.950 --> 00:36:54.875 align:middle line:84%
And then just think about
rolling outside your body.

00:36:54.875 --> 00:36:56.750 align:middle line:84%
And you're going to see
that this is actually

00:36:56.750 --> 00:36:58.820 align:middle line:84%
one of the easiest
conditions from which to have

00:36:58.820 --> 00:36:59.910 align:middle line:90%
an out-of-body experience from.

00:36:59.910 --> 00:37:00.670 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Oh, yeah,
I've rolled out--

00:37:00.670 --> 00:37:02.570 align:middle line:84%
I remember one time
rolling out of my body

00:37:02.570 --> 00:37:04.780 align:middle line:90%
into a field of plaid.

00:37:04.780 --> 00:37:07.570 align:middle line:84%
It was just a grid work of
a bunch of colored lines.

00:37:07.570 --> 00:37:09.020 align:middle line:90%
And I thought, where am I?

00:37:09.020 --> 00:37:10.690 align:middle line:84%
I was just floating
in this field.

00:37:10.690 --> 00:37:11.140 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHTER]

00:37:11.140 --> 00:37:11.640 align:middle line:90%
>>MINERO: Yeah.

00:37:11.640 --> 00:37:11.920 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:37:11.920 --> 00:37:13.170 align:middle line:84%
>>MINERO: Yeah, but
now you are out.

00:37:13.170 --> 00:37:14.960 align:middle line:84%
Now you're not feeling
the sleep paralysis.

00:37:14.960 --> 00:37:16.640 align:middle line:84%
And when you come back,
you don't feel it.

00:37:16.640 --> 00:37:17.060 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: You don't feel it.

00:37:17.060 --> 00:37:17.760 align:middle line:90%
>>MINERO: Exactly.

00:37:17.760 --> 00:37:19.160 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Oh, that's
really good, useful advice,

00:37:19.160 --> 00:37:20.510 align:middle line:90%
because that does scare people.

00:37:20.510 --> 00:37:21.260 align:middle line:90%
>>MINERO: It does, it does.

00:37:21.260 --> 00:37:23.780 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Now let's say you've
gotten out of your body.

00:37:23.780 --> 00:37:26.060 align:middle line:84%
And now, for
whatever reason, you

00:37:26.060 --> 00:37:28.560 align:middle line:84%
have landed in a place
that is not friendly.

00:37:28.560 --> 00:37:29.360 align:middle line:90%
>>MINERO: Right.

00:37:29.360 --> 00:37:33.140 align:middle line:84%
So there, if you're in a
classical, typical out-of-body

00:37:33.140 --> 00:37:35.840 align:middle line:84%
experience, normally you have
a certain level of awareness.

00:37:35.840 --> 00:37:39.290 align:middle line:84%
And then you can control,
a little bit, where to go.

00:37:39.290 --> 00:37:41.600 align:middle line:84%
So what you should try
to do is first of all,

00:37:41.600 --> 00:37:44.917 align:middle line:84%
try to have a default target, a
place where you go that it is--

00:37:44.917 --> 00:37:46.000 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Your safe place.

00:37:46.000 --> 00:37:49.870 align:middle line:84%
>>MINERO: Your safe place yeah,
or that you know very well.

00:37:49.870 --> 00:37:52.760 align:middle line:84%
And it can be as simple as
the living room of your house.

00:37:52.760 --> 00:37:55.030 align:middle line:84%
It doesn't have to
be very elaborate.

00:37:55.030 --> 00:37:56.270 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: A temple in Tibet.

00:37:56.270 --> 00:37:59.840 align:middle line:84%
>>MINERO: Yes, exactly,
a mountain in Hawaii.

00:37:59.840 --> 00:38:00.900 align:middle line:90%
It doesn't have to be--

00:38:00.900 --> 00:38:02.522 align:middle line:90%
I mean, nothing wrong with that.

00:38:02.522 --> 00:38:03.980 align:middle line:84%
But it can just
simply be something

00:38:03.980 --> 00:38:04.940 align:middle line:90%
that you know very well.

00:38:04.940 --> 00:38:06.950 align:middle line:84%
And sometimes, if you
know it already very well,

00:38:06.950 --> 00:38:08.950 align:middle line:84%
it'll be easier
for you to connect.

00:38:08.950 --> 00:38:11.300 align:middle line:84%
And you move from
wherever you happen

00:38:11.300 --> 00:38:14.000 align:middle line:84%
to end up to the living
room of your house.

00:38:14.000 --> 00:38:16.520 align:middle line:84%
Or even, for
example, some people

00:38:16.520 --> 00:38:19.530 align:middle line:84%
spend so much time in
their office at work.

00:38:19.530 --> 00:38:22.340 align:middle line:84%
And this is, I know, very
mundane and very boring.

00:38:22.340 --> 00:38:26.520 align:middle line:84%
But you can go to your
office at work very easily.

00:38:26.520 --> 00:38:30.750 align:middle line:84%
So now you're out of that
situation and in a space

00:38:30.750 --> 00:38:31.550 align:middle line:90%
that you know.

00:38:31.550 --> 00:38:33.810 align:middle line:90%
And from there you can move on.

00:38:33.810 --> 00:38:40.820 align:middle line:84%
So I would suggest trying to
have a home base beforehand.

00:38:40.820 --> 00:38:43.757 align:middle line:84%
And then, certainly, there
are all kinds of dimensions.

00:38:43.757 --> 00:38:45.590 align:middle line:84%
Some of them are a
little bit more lighter--

00:38:45.590 --> 00:38:48.710 align:middle line:84%
let me use these words,
this clarification.

00:38:48.710 --> 00:38:51.380 align:middle line:84%
Some of them are a
little bit more darker,

00:38:51.380 --> 00:38:54.260 align:middle line:84%
simply because as
people pass away,

00:38:54.260 --> 00:38:57.710 align:middle line:84%
people pass away in all
kinds of situations.

00:38:57.710 --> 00:39:00.350 align:middle line:84%
And some of them are
a little bit more

00:39:00.350 --> 00:39:05.295 align:middle line:84%
happy or understanding
of reality, and at peace

00:39:05.295 --> 00:39:06.920 align:middle line:84%
with what they have
done in their life.

00:39:06.920 --> 00:39:10.910 align:middle line:84%
And then their own
energies resonate

00:39:10.910 --> 00:39:12.140 align:middle line:90%
with these other dimensions.

00:39:12.140 --> 00:39:14.770 align:middle line:84%
And they end up in the
more lighter dimensions.

00:39:14.770 --> 00:39:18.170 align:middle line:84%
And other people
pass away because--

00:39:18.170 --> 00:39:20.360 align:middle line:84%
they pass away
disappointed or depressed.

00:39:20.360 --> 00:39:23.140 align:middle line:84%
And then they go into
those other dimensions.

00:39:23.140 --> 00:39:25.730 align:middle line:84%
And at the same
time, they contribute

00:39:25.730 --> 00:39:27.830 align:middle line:84%
with what they are bringing
to those dimensions.

00:39:27.830 --> 00:39:28.640 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:39:28.640 --> 00:39:30.330 align:middle line:84%
>>MINERO: So we don't need
to be there, obviously.

00:39:30.330 --> 00:39:32.330 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: This has
just to do with, maybe,

00:39:32.330 --> 00:39:36.050 align:middle line:84%
a level of your own development
emotionally or spiritually

00:39:36.050 --> 00:39:36.890 align:middle line:90%
in that moment--

00:39:36.890 --> 00:39:37.690 align:middle line:90%
>>MINERO: Yeah.

00:39:37.690 --> 00:39:40.040 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Which isn't who
you are, per se, as a soul.

00:39:40.040 --> 00:39:42.330 align:middle line:84%
But it is your level
of emotional resonance

00:39:42.330 --> 00:39:43.130 align:middle line:90%
in that moment.

00:39:43.130 --> 00:39:45.767 align:middle line:84%
And maybe something
traumatic or unpleasant

00:39:45.767 --> 00:39:46.850 align:middle line:90%
has happened in your life.

00:39:46.850 --> 00:39:47.180 align:middle line:90%
>>MINERO: Exactly.

00:39:47.180 --> 00:39:48.530 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And you could
when you get out of body,

00:39:48.530 --> 00:39:51.320 align:middle line:84%
find yourself resonating
with beings that are having

00:39:51.320 --> 00:39:52.623 align:middle line:90%
similar experiences, right?

00:39:52.623 --> 00:39:53.790 align:middle line:90%
>>MINERO: Yeah, it could be.

00:39:53.790 --> 00:39:56.180 align:middle line:84%
And that's where
sometimes the work

00:39:56.180 --> 00:39:58.820 align:middle line:84%
of the spirit guides,
especially, or sometimes even

00:39:58.820 --> 00:40:02.030 align:middle line:84%
certain people who have
out-of-body experiences, who

00:40:02.030 --> 00:40:04.220 align:middle line:84%
understand that,
can help to explain

00:40:04.220 --> 00:40:07.250 align:middle line:84%
that to the person,
almost the way

00:40:07.250 --> 00:40:09.950 align:middle line:84%
the person can undergo a trauma
here in their physical life.

00:40:09.950 --> 00:40:11.090 align:middle line:90%
But they go to a therapist.

00:40:11.090 --> 00:40:12.010 align:middle line:90%
And they overcome it.

00:40:12.010 --> 00:40:13.970 align:middle line:84%
And after that, the
rest of their life

00:40:13.970 --> 00:40:15.360 align:middle line:90%
is a lot more productive.

00:40:15.360 --> 00:40:16.160 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:40:16.160 --> 00:40:18.060 align:middle line:84%
>>MINERO: The same thing can
happen outside the body, where

00:40:18.060 --> 00:40:19.920 align:middle line:84%
the spirit guides,
or certain people who

00:40:19.920 --> 00:40:23.370 align:middle line:84%
have out-of-body experiences,
go to those dimensions

00:40:23.370 --> 00:40:25.890 align:middle line:84%
and realities, explain that
to those individuals that

00:40:25.890 --> 00:40:27.930 align:middle line:84%
already passed
away, and help them

00:40:27.930 --> 00:40:29.800 align:middle line:90%
to move on to other dimensions.

00:40:29.800 --> 00:40:30.600 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:40:30.600 --> 00:40:34.770 align:middle line:84%
What about situations
in which people decide--

00:40:34.770 --> 00:40:37.447 align:middle line:84%
I mean, have you ever seen this
in an experimental situation,

00:40:37.447 --> 00:40:39.780 align:middle line:84%
where two people decide they're
going to get out of body

00:40:39.780 --> 00:40:40.750 align:middle line:90%
and meet up somewhere.

00:40:40.750 --> 00:40:41.550 align:middle line:90%
>>MINERO: Yes.

00:40:41.550 --> 00:40:42.883 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Let's talk about that.

00:40:42.883 --> 00:40:44.550 align:middle line:84%
>>MINERO: And I think
that those are--

00:40:44.550 --> 00:40:46.048 align:middle line:90%
well, first of all, they're fun.

00:40:46.048 --> 00:40:47.340 align:middle line:90%
Let me get that out of the way.

00:40:47.340 --> 00:40:48.270 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Because
you've done this?

00:40:48.270 --> 00:40:48.720 align:middle line:90%
>>MINERO: Yes, I have done it.

00:40:48.720 --> 00:40:49.020 align:middle line:90%
I have done it.

00:40:49.020 --> 00:40:50.320 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Oh, I want to hear
about a couple of yours.

00:40:50.320 --> 00:40:52.050 align:middle line:84%
But let's hear
about others, too.

00:40:52.050 --> 00:40:52.925 align:middle line:90%
>>MINERO: Yeah, yeah.

00:40:52.925 --> 00:40:56.490 align:middle line:84%
First of all, they're fun
when they happen, of course.

00:40:56.490 --> 00:41:02.190 align:middle line:84%
Second, it is interesting, from
a scientific perspective, how

00:41:02.190 --> 00:41:06.480 align:middle line:84%
these types of experiences
take away the subjectivity

00:41:06.480 --> 00:41:08.122 align:middle line:84%
from the experience,
meaning most

00:41:08.122 --> 00:41:10.080 align:middle line:84%
of the out-of-body
experiences, even though you

00:41:10.080 --> 00:41:15.780 align:middle line:84%
can go and maybe verify them
somehow, still it's up to you

00:41:15.780 --> 00:41:17.090 align:middle line:90%
to say what you saw.

00:41:17.090 --> 00:41:17.890 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:41:17.890 --> 00:41:19.740 align:middle line:84%
>>MINERO: So any
skeptical researcher

00:41:19.740 --> 00:41:22.880 align:middle line:84%
would say, OK, but
you're telling me that.

00:41:22.880 --> 00:41:24.710 align:middle line:84%
But when two people
leave the body,

00:41:24.710 --> 00:41:27.620 align:middle line:84%
now you can verify it, in that
sense, with the other person.

00:41:27.620 --> 00:41:28.420 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:41:28.420 --> 00:41:31.260 align:middle line:84%
>>MINERO: So the experience
is no longer just subjective,

00:41:31.260 --> 00:41:32.760 align:middle line:90%
but it's a shared experience.

00:41:32.760 --> 00:41:34.140 align:middle line:90%
It's like going to the movies.

00:41:34.140 --> 00:41:35.390 align:middle line:90%
We go see the same movie.

00:41:35.390 --> 00:41:38.640 align:middle line:84%
Then afterwards, we're
discussing about the plot

00:41:38.640 --> 00:41:41.190 align:middle line:90%
because we saw the same reality.

00:41:41.190 --> 00:41:42.210 align:middle line:90%
So that is interesting.

00:41:42.210 --> 00:41:44.550 align:middle line:84%
That is interesting
in and of itself.

00:41:44.550 --> 00:41:47.070 align:middle line:84%
I would say when you plan
it with other people,

00:41:47.070 --> 00:41:49.990 align:middle line:90%
it certainly can happen--

00:41:49.990 --> 00:41:51.720 align:middle line:84%
not the easiest
experience, because they

00:41:51.720 --> 00:41:53.820 align:middle line:84%
both need to leave the
body at the same time.

00:41:53.820 --> 00:41:56.040 align:middle line:84%
And they need to find
themselves and meet

00:41:56.040 --> 00:41:58.378 align:middle line:90%
in the same exact place.

00:41:58.378 --> 00:42:00.420 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Would you maybe
choose a meeting place,

00:42:00.420 --> 00:42:01.845 align:middle line:84%
like you have a
mutual safe place?

00:42:01.845 --> 00:42:02.130 align:middle line:90%
>>MINERO: You do.

00:42:02.130 --> 00:42:02.930 align:middle line:90%
Yeah, you do.

00:42:02.930 --> 00:42:04.750 align:middle line:84%
But sometimes, if you've
missed each other,

00:42:04.750 --> 00:42:06.475 align:middle line:84%
let's say, by five
minutes, now--

00:42:06.475 --> 00:42:07.600 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right, it's gone.

00:42:07.600 --> 00:42:08.700 align:middle line:90%
You blew it.

00:42:08.700 --> 00:42:10.940 align:middle line:84%
>>MINERO: Yeah,
it's gone, exactly.

00:42:10.940 --> 00:42:14.290 align:middle line:84%
But however, even
then, it happens.

00:42:14.290 --> 00:42:17.820 align:middle line:84%
And sometimes the easiest
thing is when the other person

00:42:17.820 --> 00:42:19.410 align:middle line:90%
is close to you.

00:42:19.410 --> 00:42:23.100 align:middle line:84%
So an experience that happened
to me, maybe a couple of years

00:42:23.100 --> 00:42:24.720 align:middle line:84%
ago, I was with
this friend of mine

00:42:24.720 --> 00:42:29.810 align:middle line:84%
giving a workshop in a small
city outside of Mexico City.

00:42:29.810 --> 00:42:32.440 align:middle line:84%
And I regained my
awareness that night.

00:42:32.440 --> 00:42:35.540 align:middle line:84%
I felt the vibrations
that many people feel.

00:42:35.540 --> 00:42:37.360 align:middle line:84%
And I realized, OK,
I'm leaving the body.

00:42:37.360 --> 00:42:38.460 align:middle line:90%
I left my body.

00:42:38.460 --> 00:42:40.650 align:middle line:90%
And I was disconnected.

00:42:40.650 --> 00:42:44.430 align:middle line:84%
We were basically-- we were
in the same hotel room.

00:42:44.430 --> 00:42:46.060 align:middle line:90%
So he was there next to me.

00:42:46.060 --> 00:42:48.898 align:middle line:84%
He's also an instructor
and somebody who

00:42:48.898 --> 00:42:50.190 align:middle line:90%
teaches out-of-body experience.

00:42:50.190 --> 00:42:52.020 align:middle line:84%
So I said, let me see
if I can wake him up

00:42:52.020 --> 00:42:53.742 align:middle line:90%
to an out-of-body experience.

00:42:53.742 --> 00:42:55.200 align:middle line:84%
And this is something
that is hard,

00:42:55.200 --> 00:42:58.257 align:middle line:84%
to wake up somebody else in
an out-of-body experience.

00:42:58.257 --> 00:43:00.340 align:middle line:84%
It's easier to wake them
up physically, of course.

00:43:00.340 --> 00:43:00.900 align:middle line:90%
We've all done it.

00:43:00.900 --> 00:43:01.590 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah, right.

00:43:01.590 --> 00:43:03.840 align:middle line:84%
>>MINERO: But in an out-of-body
experience, it's hard.

00:43:03.840 --> 00:43:09.600 align:middle line:84%
So I grabbed his astral body
and tried to move away from him,

00:43:09.600 --> 00:43:10.622 align:middle line:90%
from his physical body.

00:43:10.622 --> 00:43:12.080 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Right,
help lift him out.

00:43:12.080 --> 00:43:14.400 align:middle line:84%
>>MINERO: I was trying
to lift him out.

00:43:14.400 --> 00:43:18.360 align:middle line:84%
But this is the part of
dealing with the distance.

00:43:18.360 --> 00:43:20.980 align:middle line:84%
Now he is a little bit more
distanced from his body.

00:43:20.980 --> 00:43:23.720 align:middle line:84%
But still, his awareness
is something that is his.

00:43:23.720 --> 00:43:26.767 align:middle line:84%
And I thought at that moment
of starting to send energies

00:43:26.767 --> 00:43:29.100 align:middle line:84%
into exteriorized energies,
more or less in the same way

00:43:29.100 --> 00:43:30.630 align:middle line:90%
that Reiki practitioners do--

00:43:30.630 --> 00:43:31.430 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:43:31.430 --> 00:43:34.440 align:middle line:84%
>>MINERO: But now outside the
body, but with the intention

00:43:34.440 --> 00:43:36.930 align:middle line:84%
of helping him to
regain awareness.

00:43:36.930 --> 00:43:39.010 align:middle line:84%
So awareness,
awareness, awareness.

00:43:39.010 --> 00:43:42.090 align:middle line:84%
And I was there for
maybe what seemed

00:43:42.090 --> 00:43:44.780 align:middle line:84%
like two, five minutes,
you know, exteriorizing

00:43:44.780 --> 00:43:47.060 align:middle line:84%
to him, because I
wanted for him to you

00:43:47.060 --> 00:43:49.530 align:middle line:90%
realize, hey, we're here.

00:43:49.530 --> 00:43:51.900 align:middle line:84%
Little by little, he
started to open his eyes.

00:43:51.900 --> 00:43:54.160 align:middle line:84%
And he started to realize
what was going on.

00:43:54.160 --> 00:43:55.570 align:middle line:90%
And then he started to smile.

00:43:55.570 --> 00:43:58.230 align:middle line:84%
I always tell him, I
don't forget his smile,

00:43:58.230 --> 00:43:59.835 align:middle line:90%
because he started to realize--

00:43:59.835 --> 00:44:00.670 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: I did it.

00:44:00.670 --> 00:44:03.390 align:middle line:84%
>>MINERO: Yes, we
are outside the body!

00:44:03.390 --> 00:44:06.080 align:middle line:90%
We did it.

00:44:06.080 --> 00:44:08.580 align:middle line:84%
And really, it worked because
it was him, because he already

00:44:08.580 --> 00:44:09.075 align:middle line:90%
has experience with--

00:44:09.075 --> 00:44:09.930 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So did you
go somewhere else

00:44:09.930 --> 00:44:11.050 align:middle line:90%
and do something else?

00:44:11.050 --> 00:44:12.540 align:middle line:84%
>>MINERO: Yes, I
told him, look--

00:44:12.540 --> 00:44:13.920 align:middle line:90%
so now, let's start.

00:44:13.920 --> 00:44:16.450 align:middle line:90%
Let's fly here, over this--

00:44:16.450 --> 00:44:19.380 align:middle line:84%
it's a place in the
south of Mexico,

00:44:19.380 --> 00:44:22.530 align:middle line:84%
with a lot of hills and
valleys, actually very nice,

00:44:22.530 --> 00:44:24.030 align:middle line:90%
very tropical.

00:44:24.030 --> 00:44:27.150 align:middle line:84%
And we started flying
there for a little bit.

00:44:27.150 --> 00:44:29.340 align:middle line:84%
But after a while,
I lost track of him.

00:44:29.340 --> 00:44:33.390 align:middle line:84%
And I didn't see him
again in the experience.

00:44:33.390 --> 00:44:37.050 align:middle line:84%
Later on, he mentioned
to me that he

00:44:37.050 --> 00:44:39.150 align:middle line:84%
had had in his
mind something that

00:44:39.150 --> 00:44:40.650 align:middle line:84%
was happening in
New York-- he lives

00:44:40.650 --> 00:44:42.608 align:middle line:84%
in New York-- and his
daughters and everything.

00:44:42.608 --> 00:44:45.840 align:middle line:84%
And it seems that he probably
ended up going over there.

00:44:45.840 --> 00:44:51.025 align:middle line:84%
But for a good five, 10
minutes, we were there together,

00:44:51.025 --> 00:44:52.150 align:middle line:90%
having the same experience.

00:44:52.150 --> 00:44:53.275 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: This lovely time.

00:44:53.275 --> 00:44:54.075 align:middle line:90%
>>MINERO: Yes.

00:44:54.075 --> 00:44:55.060 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: I love it.

00:44:55.060 --> 00:44:56.185 align:middle line:90%
>>MINERO: Yeah, yeah, yeah.

00:44:56.185 --> 00:44:58.620 align:middle line:84%
So that was one of
the more recent ones.

00:44:58.620 --> 00:45:04.000 align:middle line:84%
I have had others with friends
of mine, et cetera, et cetera.

00:45:04.000 --> 00:45:06.300 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Has there been
anything where the two of you

00:45:06.300 --> 00:45:09.390 align:middle line:84%
may have stumbled into something
and made a discovery together

00:45:09.390 --> 00:45:12.570 align:middle line:84%
while you're out of body, or
been surprised by something?

00:45:12.570 --> 00:45:14.300 align:middle line:90%
>>MINERO: With another person?

00:45:14.300 --> 00:45:18.373 align:middle line:84%
Not that I can recall, that we
both stumbled into something.

00:45:18.373 --> 00:45:20.540 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So tell me something
you've stumbled into.

00:45:20.540 --> 00:45:23.960 align:middle line:84%
>>MINERO: Well, for a
while there, I was--

00:45:23.960 --> 00:45:27.380 align:middle line:84%
especially when I
was early 20s or so--

00:45:27.380 --> 00:45:32.160 align:middle line:84%
trying to verify my
out-of-body experiences,

00:45:32.160 --> 00:45:35.060 align:middle line:84%
trying to see things
that I didn't know where

00:45:35.060 --> 00:45:37.893 align:middle line:84%
in the physical reality, so that
afterwards I could come back--

00:45:37.893 --> 00:45:39.810 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And check it
out, yeah, research it.

00:45:39.810 --> 00:45:41.768 align:middle line:84%
>>MINERO: Go physically
and check it out, yeah.

00:45:41.768 --> 00:45:45.690 align:middle line:84%
And I thought of
a lot of things.

00:45:45.690 --> 00:45:48.060 align:middle line:84%
Some of them were, for
example, I would leave my body.

00:45:48.060 --> 00:45:51.530 align:middle line:84%
And we all have electronic
equipment-- the TV, the stereo,

00:45:51.530 --> 00:45:52.740 align:middle line:90%
et cetera.

00:45:52.740 --> 00:45:56.150 align:middle line:84%
And what I wanted was to go
behind the TV and, for example,

00:45:56.150 --> 00:45:58.640 align:middle line:84%
read the numbers of
the serial number.

00:45:58.640 --> 00:45:59.510 align:middle line:90%
Which they're there.

00:45:59.510 --> 00:46:01.445 align:middle line:84%
It's just that none of
us has ever read them--

00:46:01.445 --> 00:46:02.570 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Read them, right.

00:46:02.570 --> 00:46:05.000 align:middle line:84%
>>MINERO: And even if we
had, we don't remember them.

00:46:05.000 --> 00:46:06.500 align:middle line:90%
I had never read them.

00:46:06.500 --> 00:46:10.400 align:middle line:84%
But anyway, that
turned out to be hard,

00:46:10.400 --> 00:46:12.810 align:middle line:84%
just because reading
those little numbers,

00:46:12.810 --> 00:46:15.190 align:middle line:84%
especially outside the
body, reading characters

00:46:15.190 --> 00:46:16.340 align:middle line:90%
is not the easiest.

00:46:16.340 --> 00:46:17.892 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:46:17.892 --> 00:46:19.850 align:middle line:84%
>>MINERO: Another thing
I was also trying to do

00:46:19.850 --> 00:46:23.750 align:middle line:84%
was to leave my body and to go
maybe two or three blocks away

00:46:23.750 --> 00:46:26.840 align:middle line:84%
from my house, and try to see
the cars that were parked there

00:46:26.840 --> 00:46:29.180 align:middle line:84%
at night, and try just
simply to memorize

00:46:29.180 --> 00:46:32.420 align:middle line:84%
the sequence of the colors,
and if possible, one or two

00:46:32.420 --> 00:46:34.790 align:middle line:84%
characters of the license
plate of one of them.

00:46:34.790 --> 00:46:36.580 align:middle line:90%
And that, I was able to do.

00:46:36.580 --> 00:46:37.760 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And then when
you got up in the morning,

00:46:37.760 --> 00:46:38.677 align:middle line:90%
you'd go check it out?

00:46:38.677 --> 00:46:40.437 align:middle line:84%
>>MINERO: I actually
would come back.

00:46:40.437 --> 00:46:41.770 align:middle line:90%
And I would try to go, 3, 4 AM--

00:46:41.770 --> 00:46:42.230 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Oh, I see.

00:46:42.230 --> 00:46:43.440 align:middle line:84%
>>MINERO: In the morning
with the flashlight.

00:46:43.440 --> 00:46:45.160 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: And go check it out.

00:46:45.160 --> 00:46:47.327 align:middle line:84%
>>MINERO: Yeah, because I
didn't know what time they

00:46:47.327 --> 00:46:48.740 align:middle line:90%
were going to be moved.

00:46:48.740 --> 00:46:52.280 align:middle line:84%
And yes, that I
was able to verify

00:46:52.280 --> 00:46:56.120 align:middle line:84%
on a couple of
opportunities, the cars.

00:46:56.120 --> 00:46:57.950 align:middle line:90%
So again, trying to--

00:46:57.950 --> 00:47:00.795 align:middle line:90%


00:47:00.795 --> 00:47:03.170 align:middle line:84%
I already knew that I was
having out-of-body experiences.

00:47:03.170 --> 00:47:05.680 align:middle line:84%
But I wanted to have the
physical verification of that

00:47:05.680 --> 00:47:06.480 align:middle line:90%
as well.

00:47:06.480 --> 00:47:07.280 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:47:07.280 --> 00:47:10.370 align:middle line:84%
I remember one experience
which was out-of-body,

00:47:10.370 --> 00:47:11.630 align:middle line:90%
but I couldn't get upright.

00:47:11.630 --> 00:47:13.410 align:middle line:84%
So I was flying down
the stairs headfirst.

00:47:13.410 --> 00:47:14.210 align:middle line:90%
>>MINERO: Yes.

00:47:14.210 --> 00:47:15.830 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And my son
was sleeping downstairs.

00:47:15.830 --> 00:47:17.497 align:middle line:84%
We had guests that
were taking his room.

00:47:17.497 --> 00:47:18.500 align:middle line:90%
He was on the couch.

00:47:18.500 --> 00:47:21.710 align:middle line:84%
And I landed in the middle
of the room upside down.

00:47:21.710 --> 00:47:24.580 align:middle line:90%
And so my feet were up.

00:47:24.580 --> 00:47:25.880 align:middle line:90%
Obviously I was upside down.

00:47:25.880 --> 00:47:29.045 align:middle line:90%
And I thought, OK.

00:47:29.045 --> 00:47:30.920 align:middle line:84%
I just felt embarrassed
that I couldn't right

00:47:30.920 --> 00:47:32.690 align:middle line:90%
myself so that my head was up.

00:47:32.690 --> 00:47:36.770 align:middle line:84%
And my son lifted up out of
his body and was staring at me.

00:47:36.770 --> 00:47:38.930 align:middle line:84%
And he was basically
saying, what

00:47:38.930 --> 00:47:42.720 align:middle line:84%
are you doing upside down
here in the living room?

00:47:42.720 --> 00:47:43.970 align:middle line:90%
>>MINERO: So he could see you?

00:47:43.970 --> 00:47:45.070 align:middle line:90%
He could perceive you?

00:47:45.070 --> 00:47:47.360 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Yeah, I saw him
rising out of his body,

00:47:47.360 --> 00:47:50.488 align:middle line:84%
perceiving me hanging upside
down in the middle of the air.

00:47:50.488 --> 00:47:52.280 align:middle line:84%
>>MINERO: And when
you're outside the body,

00:47:52.280 --> 00:47:55.280 align:middle line:84%
you end up in all those types of
positions, strange positions--

00:47:55.280 --> 00:47:55.410 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Oh, yeah.

00:47:55.410 --> 00:47:56.588 align:middle line:90%
Yeah, I've been in those.

00:47:56.588 --> 00:47:58.880 align:middle line:84%
>>MINERO: Because obviously,
we don't have the gravity.

00:47:58.880 --> 00:48:01.600 align:middle line:90%
We don't need a chair anymore.

00:48:01.600 --> 00:48:02.430 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Exactly.

00:48:02.430 --> 00:48:04.592 align:middle line:84%
>>MINERO: By the way,
did he remember it?

00:48:04.592 --> 00:48:06.050 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: I didn't--
you know what?

00:48:06.050 --> 00:48:07.260 align:middle line:90%
I never asked him about it.

00:48:07.260 --> 00:48:08.900 align:middle line:90%
And he's a really lucid dreamer.

00:48:08.900 --> 00:48:10.983 align:middle line:84%
I should have asked him,
because he probably would

00:48:10.983 --> 00:48:12.540 align:middle line:90%
have remembered it, actually.

00:48:12.540 --> 00:48:15.452 align:middle line:84%
OK, so I was going
to say earlier,

00:48:15.452 --> 00:48:16.910 align:middle line:84%
part of what you
were talking about

00:48:16.910 --> 00:48:18.452 align:middle line:84%
reminded me of the
work that was done

00:48:18.452 --> 00:48:21.630 align:middle line:84%
at the Monroe Institute, when
they would send Tom Campbell

00:48:21.630 --> 00:48:22.430 align:middle line:90%
and--

00:48:22.430 --> 00:48:25.370 align:middle line:84%
I've forgotten the name of
the other guy, Dennis someone.

00:48:25.370 --> 00:48:27.320 align:middle line:84%
They would send them
out from the lab,

00:48:27.320 --> 00:48:29.960 align:middle line:84%
have them meet out there,
have a similar experience,

00:48:29.960 --> 00:48:34.730 align:middle line:84%
report back, talk, and report
back to the lab technician

00:48:34.730 --> 00:48:37.100 align:middle line:84%
that they would report to,
and then compare the notes.

00:48:37.100 --> 00:48:39.950 align:middle line:84%
And they were very
specifically having

00:48:39.950 --> 00:48:41.490 align:middle line:90%
the exact same experience.

00:48:41.490 --> 00:48:42.290 align:middle line:90%
>>MINERO: Yeah.

00:48:42.290 --> 00:48:44.630 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And I have done
that with another person.

00:48:44.630 --> 00:48:45.430 align:middle line:90%
>>MINERO: Yes.

00:48:45.430 --> 00:48:47.750 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Where she and
I would go together--

00:48:47.750 --> 00:48:49.760 align:middle line:90%
we would choose to go together.

00:48:49.760 --> 00:48:52.430 align:middle line:84%
But when we left the body,
we were actually using--

00:48:52.430 --> 00:48:56.750 align:middle line:84%
in this case, we used geometry,
this particular symbol.

00:48:56.750 --> 00:49:00.980 align:middle line:84%
Anyway, we would
choose in unison

00:49:00.980 --> 00:49:03.170 align:middle line:90%
to go through the symbol.

00:49:03.170 --> 00:49:07.580 align:middle line:84%
And then on the other
side, what happened was I

00:49:07.580 --> 00:49:09.950 align:middle line:84%
think almost more like
what people would describe

00:49:09.950 --> 00:49:11.070 align:middle line:90%
a near-death experience.

00:49:11.070 --> 00:49:13.195 align:middle line:84%
It wasn't like other times
where you just roll out,

00:49:13.195 --> 00:49:15.032 align:middle line:84%
or you're in plaid
or upside down.

00:49:15.032 --> 00:49:16.490 align:middle line:84%
We went through an
experience where

00:49:16.490 --> 00:49:18.290 align:middle line:90%
we would break into billions.

00:49:18.290 --> 00:49:21.410 align:middle line:84%
And we would dissolve
into billions

00:49:21.410 --> 00:49:24.140 align:middle line:90%
of white particles of light.

00:49:24.140 --> 00:49:28.640 align:middle line:84%
It felt like a chill in
every cell of your body.

00:49:28.640 --> 00:49:32.750 align:middle line:84%
It was just this feeling
as you blew apart, but then

00:49:32.750 --> 00:49:36.920 align:middle line:84%
reassembled in another dimension
in a much lighter form, again

00:49:36.920 --> 00:49:38.358 align:middle line:90%
suspended like that.

00:49:38.358 --> 00:49:40.400 align:middle line:84%
So it was like going
through that tunnel of light

00:49:40.400 --> 00:49:43.730 align:middle line:84%
where you, pow, blow
apart and rematerialize.

00:49:43.730 --> 00:49:45.290 align:middle line:90%
Is that something that you've--

00:49:45.290 --> 00:49:46.090 align:middle line:90%
>>MINERO: Yes.

00:49:46.090 --> 00:49:48.275 align:middle line:84%
And that tends to
happen, especially

00:49:48.275 --> 00:49:50.650 align:middle line:84%
when it seems that we're going
to another dimension, even

00:49:50.650 --> 00:49:51.200 align:middle line:90%
dimensions that tend to be--

00:49:51.200 --> 00:49:53.200 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Yes, this was
another dimension, yeah.

00:49:53.200 --> 00:49:55.830 align:middle line:84%
>>MINERO: Yeah, a
little bit further out.

00:49:55.830 --> 00:49:56.630 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:49:56.630 --> 00:49:58.520 align:middle line:84%
>>MINERO: Difficult
to say what further

00:49:58.520 --> 00:50:00.980 align:middle line:84%
means, because
distance just doesn't

00:50:00.980 --> 00:50:02.780 align:middle line:90%
have the same meaning as here.

00:50:02.780 --> 00:50:04.160 align:middle line:90%
So it's not a hundred miles.

00:50:04.160 --> 00:50:04.960 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:50:04.960 --> 00:50:07.370 align:middle line:84%
>>MINERO: But somehow,
dimensionally speaking,

00:50:07.370 --> 00:50:09.590 align:middle line:84%
seems to be a little
bit further away.

00:50:09.590 --> 00:50:12.240 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Yeah, and have you
had that experience, too?

00:50:12.240 --> 00:50:13.040 align:middle line:90%
>>MINERO: Yes, yes.

00:50:13.040 --> 00:50:14.915 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Because it's
a very unique feeling.

00:50:14.915 --> 00:50:18.280 align:middle line:84%
>>MINERO: And feeling lighter
afterwards, especially once you

00:50:18.280 --> 00:50:19.480 align:middle line:90%
are in that other dimension.

00:50:19.480 --> 00:50:21.550 align:middle line:90%
One of the things that I think--

00:50:21.550 --> 00:50:24.840 align:middle line:84%
maybe a few people that
I've heard of talk about it.

00:50:24.840 --> 00:50:27.510 align:middle line:84%
But maybe more people who
have a near-death experience

00:50:27.510 --> 00:50:28.310 align:middle line:90%
talk about it.

00:50:28.310 --> 00:50:30.477 align:middle line:84%
But I think it's one of the
most interesting things,

00:50:30.477 --> 00:50:33.010 align:middle line:84%
is when you are there
in that other dimension,

00:50:33.010 --> 00:50:37.180 align:middle line:84%
you have that feeling of
warmth, of the fact that you're

00:50:37.180 --> 00:50:42.410 align:middle line:84%
being received like an old
friend, like an old brother.

00:50:42.410 --> 00:50:46.510 align:middle line:84%
And part of what I have noticed
that is happening in that place

00:50:46.510 --> 00:50:50.680 align:middle line:84%
is that trying to
think across many lives

00:50:50.680 --> 00:50:54.670 align:middle line:84%
and many experiences, many
of the biggest, biggest

00:50:54.670 --> 00:50:59.230 align:middle line:84%
friends, or the closest friends,
closest relatives, spouses

00:50:59.230 --> 00:51:01.870 align:middle line:84%
that we have had from
other lives, for example,

00:51:01.870 --> 00:51:03.660 align:middle line:84%
they are not necessarily
alive right now.

00:51:03.660 --> 00:51:04.460 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:51:04.460 --> 00:51:05.390 align:middle line:90%
>>MINERO: So some of them are.

00:51:05.390 --> 00:51:06.498 align:middle line:90%
But some of them aren't.

00:51:06.498 --> 00:51:09.040 align:middle line:84%
And then sometimes, in some of
those out-of-body experiences,

00:51:09.040 --> 00:51:12.330 align:middle line:84%
we re-encounter this
network of friends.

00:51:12.330 --> 00:51:16.420 align:middle line:84%
And some of them are
closest, closest friends who

00:51:16.420 --> 00:51:19.673 align:middle line:84%
respect us, love us,
understand us sometimes,

00:51:19.673 --> 00:51:22.090 align:middle line:84%
not just because we did good
things with them in the past,

00:51:22.090 --> 00:51:24.750 align:middle line:84%
but because we were mischievous
with them in the past,

00:51:24.750 --> 00:51:26.667 align:middle line:84%
and we got into trouble
with them in the past.

00:51:26.667 --> 00:51:27.467 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:51:27.467 --> 00:51:29.560 align:middle line:84%
>>MINERO: But we all
understand ourselves so well.

00:51:29.560 --> 00:51:31.970 align:middle line:84%
So the moment that
you're back there,

00:51:31.970 --> 00:51:36.850 align:middle line:84%
and they see you as my
friend from many lives

00:51:36.850 --> 00:51:39.730 align:middle line:84%
that I haven't seen you
in a while, the feeling

00:51:39.730 --> 00:51:43.060 align:middle line:90%
is so overwhelming, really.

00:51:43.060 --> 00:51:44.080 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: So welcoming.

00:51:44.080 --> 00:51:45.038 align:middle line:90%
>>MINERO: So welcoming.

00:51:45.038 --> 00:51:48.040 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And it was like this--
when we would go there, it

00:51:48.040 --> 00:51:49.360 align:middle line:90%
was almost like a void.

00:51:49.360 --> 00:51:54.790 align:middle line:84%
But I was fully aware there were
Native American elder women,

00:51:54.790 --> 00:51:58.630 align:middle line:84%
like medicine women, who would
be sitting on the periphery

00:51:58.630 --> 00:52:02.782 align:middle line:84%
quietly, just sitting and
watching us, like babysitters.

00:52:02.782 --> 00:52:04.240 align:middle line:84%
Like they were to
see we didn't get

00:52:04.240 --> 00:52:06.340 align:middle line:84%
in any kind of serious
trouble, because we

00:52:06.340 --> 00:52:07.750 align:middle line:90%
didn't know what we were doing.

00:52:07.750 --> 00:52:09.610 align:middle line:84%
Because we're
tilted a little bit.

00:52:09.610 --> 00:52:12.580 align:middle line:84%
And we're looking down, our
feet were too tiny to walk on.

00:52:12.580 --> 00:52:14.900 align:middle line:84%
And it was all this
weird stuff going on.

00:52:14.900 --> 00:52:18.700 align:middle line:84%
And so they would just
quietly watch over us.

00:52:18.700 --> 00:52:21.080 align:middle line:84%
And you felt that
protection and that love

00:52:21.080 --> 00:52:23.710 align:middle line:84%
and that warmth until
it was time to go home.

00:52:23.710 --> 00:52:27.850 align:middle line:84%
And you just know when it's time
to go, after we have some fun

00:52:27.850 --> 00:52:30.190 align:middle line:84%
and be in awe over
the whole thing.

00:52:30.190 --> 00:52:32.650 align:middle line:84%
But when we came back,
the feeling of coming back

00:52:32.650 --> 00:52:34.240 align:middle line:90%
was really horrible.

00:52:34.240 --> 00:52:35.627 align:middle line:90%
To come back into this density--

00:52:35.627 --> 00:52:37.210 align:middle line:84%
>>MINERO: Into the
physical body, yes.

00:52:37.210 --> 00:52:38.890 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Into the
physical body felt

00:52:38.890 --> 00:52:43.350 align:middle line:84%
like literally just merging
with mud after being

00:52:43.350 --> 00:52:44.870 align:middle line:90%
out in these other places.

00:52:44.870 --> 00:52:45.670 align:middle line:90%
>>MINERO: Yeah.

00:52:45.670 --> 00:52:47.860 align:middle line:84%
I would say that
the way I feel it,

00:52:47.860 --> 00:52:52.280 align:middle line:84%
you know when you've been
diving with a wetsuit?

00:52:52.280 --> 00:52:53.080 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:52:53.080 --> 00:52:55.090 align:middle line:84%
>>MINERO: And then,
let's say, for lunch you

00:52:55.090 --> 00:52:56.200 align:middle line:90%
come out from the water.

00:52:56.200 --> 00:52:58.060 align:middle line:90%
And you take the wetsuit off.

00:52:58.060 --> 00:52:59.200 align:middle line:90%
You have lunch.

00:52:59.200 --> 00:53:01.960 align:middle line:84%
And then afterwards, you're
going to put it on to go again,

00:53:01.960 --> 00:53:03.010 align:middle line:90%
diving in the afternoon.

00:53:03.010 --> 00:53:05.410 align:middle line:84%
So the moment that you put
it on again, it's cold.

00:53:05.410 --> 00:53:06.210 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: It is.

00:53:06.210 --> 00:53:07.600 align:middle line:90%
>>MINERO: It's wet.

00:53:07.600 --> 00:53:08.720 align:middle line:90%
It's restrictive.

00:53:08.720 --> 00:53:09.637 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Restrictive.

00:53:09.637 --> 00:53:11.110 align:middle line:90%
And this was just flat dense.

00:53:11.110 --> 00:53:12.257 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHTER]

00:53:12.257 --> 00:53:13.840 align:middle line:84%
We did, by the way,
get in trouble one

00:53:13.840 --> 00:53:16.120 align:middle line:84%
time out there, which we
don't have time to go into.

00:53:16.120 --> 00:53:18.580 align:middle line:84%
We got into a bad
place one time.

00:53:18.580 --> 00:53:21.070 align:middle line:84%
It took a while to work our
way through that in the end.

00:53:21.070 --> 00:53:22.210 align:middle line:90%
But we got out.

00:53:22.210 --> 00:53:23.080 align:middle line:90%
It was OK.

00:53:23.080 --> 00:53:24.940 align:middle line:90%
But let's talk about--

00:53:24.940 --> 00:53:26.950 align:middle line:84%
first of all, like you
talked about earlier--

00:53:26.950 --> 00:53:28.480 align:middle line:84%
we just have a
few minutes left--

00:53:28.480 --> 00:53:29.980 align:middle line:84%
how we often frighten
ourselves when

00:53:29.980 --> 00:53:32.055 align:middle line:84%
we feel that departure from
the body or sleep paralysis.

00:53:32.055 --> 00:53:32.400 align:middle line:90%
>>MINERO: Yes.

00:53:32.400 --> 00:53:33.730 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: So stay calm.

00:53:33.730 --> 00:53:35.500 align:middle line:90%
Roll out, we've got that.

00:53:35.500 --> 00:53:37.785 align:middle line:90%
Tell us some other techniques.

00:53:37.785 --> 00:53:39.160 align:middle line:84%
It sounds like
people really need

00:53:39.160 --> 00:53:42.370 align:middle line:84%
to embrace the notion of
reading books first, getting

00:53:42.370 --> 00:53:43.480 align:middle line:90%
a feel for what happens.

00:53:43.480 --> 00:53:44.220 align:middle line:90%
>>MINERO: That helps, yes.

00:53:44.220 --> 00:53:46.090 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: But give us a
few tips about what someone

00:53:46.090 --> 00:53:47.670 align:middle line:84%
is so enthusiastic
right now, they're, I'm

00:53:47.670 --> 00:53:48.628 align:middle line:90%
going to do it tonight.

00:53:48.628 --> 00:53:50.380 align:middle line:90%
>>MINERO: Yeah, yeah.

00:53:50.380 --> 00:53:52.780 align:middle line:84%
I think that one of
the better things

00:53:52.780 --> 00:53:56.020 align:middle line:84%
is also to learn to
control your energetic body

00:53:56.020 --> 00:53:59.908 align:middle line:84%
and your own vital
energies-- chi, prana.

00:53:59.908 --> 00:54:01.450 align:middle line:84%
I think that that
also will help you.

00:54:01.450 --> 00:54:03.400 align:middle line:84%
A lot of confidence, and
even outside the body

00:54:03.400 --> 00:54:05.200 align:middle line:90%
you end up using it as well.

00:54:05.200 --> 00:54:08.950 align:middle line:84%
So there is a technique that
we call the vertical flow.

00:54:08.950 --> 00:54:12.280 align:middle line:84%
It's just moving the energies
up and down inside your body,

00:54:12.280 --> 00:54:14.710 align:middle line:84%
that you can do both
inside the body.

00:54:14.710 --> 00:54:16.330 align:middle line:84%
Or you could do it
outside the body.

00:54:16.330 --> 00:54:19.420 align:middle line:84%
And that one gives you
energetic protection.

00:54:19.420 --> 00:54:21.025 align:middle line:90%
It helps you to--

00:54:21.025 --> 00:54:23.200 align:middle line:90%
it resets yourself.

00:54:23.200 --> 00:54:24.280 align:middle line:90%
It balances you.

00:54:24.280 --> 00:54:25.930 align:middle line:84%
It helps you to
raise the awareness,

00:54:25.930 --> 00:54:29.597 align:middle line:84%
so afterwards you're
thinking clearer.

00:54:29.597 --> 00:54:31.180 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: How do you
actually do that?

00:54:31.180 --> 00:54:32.350 align:middle line:90%
What do you envision?

00:54:32.350 --> 00:54:34.480 align:middle line:84%
>>MINERO: You basically
start to try to feel

00:54:34.480 --> 00:54:36.370 align:middle line:90%
your energies inside of you.

00:54:36.370 --> 00:54:39.220 align:middle line:84%
And you start to move this
feeling inside of your body,

00:54:39.220 --> 00:54:41.860 align:middle line:84%
going all the way down through
your body to your feet,

00:54:41.860 --> 00:54:44.650 align:middle line:84%
and then from your feet
all the way up to the head,

00:54:44.650 --> 00:54:46.940 align:middle line:90%
to the feet, to the head.

00:54:46.940 --> 00:54:49.940 align:middle line:84%
More than a visualization, it's
almost like trying to feel it.

00:54:49.940 --> 00:54:50.740 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:54:50.740 --> 00:54:54.520 align:middle line:84%
>>MINERO: And several,
actually, authors

00:54:54.520 --> 00:54:56.528 align:middle line:84%
on this topic of
out-of-body experiences,

00:54:56.528 --> 00:54:58.570 align:middle line:84%
they sometimes describe
it in different fashions.

00:54:58.570 --> 00:55:00.790 align:middle line:90%
But it's basically doing this.

00:55:00.790 --> 00:55:03.070 align:middle line:84%
I think that one
was calling it--

00:55:03.070 --> 00:55:05.770 align:middle line:84%
which I like this description--
like the yo-yo movement,

00:55:05.770 --> 00:55:07.950 align:middle line:84%
almost as if you have
a yo-yo of energies.

00:55:07.950 --> 00:55:11.020 align:middle line:84%
And the yo-yo is
going down and up

00:55:11.020 --> 00:55:12.820 align:middle line:84%
and down and up
inside your body.

00:55:12.820 --> 00:55:16.270 align:middle line:84%
You're feeling that
motion going up and down.

00:55:16.270 --> 00:55:19.770 align:middle line:84%
And after a while-- actually,
by the way, for the viewers,

00:55:19.770 --> 00:55:22.530 align:middle line:84%
after a while that you
keep on doing this-- five,

00:55:22.530 --> 00:55:25.860 align:middle line:84%
10 minutes if you get
very proficient at it--

00:55:25.860 --> 00:55:27.570 align:middle line:84%
your own energetic
system is going

00:55:27.570 --> 00:55:29.640 align:middle line:84%
to enter into a resonance
condition that is

00:55:29.640 --> 00:55:31.380 align:middle line:90%
called the vibrational state.

00:55:31.380 --> 00:55:33.375 align:middle line:84%
And from this condition,
you can induce

00:55:33.375 --> 00:55:34.500 align:middle line:90%
the out-of-body experience.

00:55:34.500 --> 00:55:35.220 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes, you can pop out.

00:55:35.220 --> 00:55:35.400 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:55:35.400 --> 00:55:36.200 align:middle line:90%
>>MINERO: Exactly.

00:55:36.200 --> 00:55:39.960 align:middle line:84%
So the vertical flow
produces the vibrations

00:55:39.960 --> 00:55:41.610 align:middle line:84%
that induce the
out-of-body experience.

00:55:41.610 --> 00:55:44.240 align:middle line:84%
So it's also a technique,
already, for leaving the body

00:55:44.240 --> 00:55:46.580 align:middle line:84%
and for protection, for
feeling more confident.

00:55:46.580 --> 00:55:47.380 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: OK.

00:55:47.380 --> 00:55:49.090 align:middle line:90%
So we can do that.

00:55:49.090 --> 00:55:51.150 align:middle line:90%
So don't go into fear.

00:55:51.150 --> 00:55:53.880 align:middle line:84%
We can do that to prep ourselves
and catapult ourselves out.

00:55:53.880 --> 00:55:56.847 align:middle line:84%
What are some other basic
strategies for doing this?

00:55:56.847 --> 00:55:58.680 align:middle line:84%
>>MINERO: Yeah, and by
the way, you can also

00:55:58.680 --> 00:55:59.850 align:middle line:90%
do that outside the body.

00:55:59.850 --> 00:56:02.400 align:middle line:84%
That'll make you feel more
confident and in control.

00:56:02.400 --> 00:56:02.490 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:56:02.490 --> 00:56:04.930 align:middle line:84%
>>MINERO: And then you can
go to a different place.

00:56:04.930 --> 00:56:07.290 align:middle line:84%
Other things that you can
do is also, obviously,

00:56:07.290 --> 00:56:11.310 align:middle line:84%
using your own bio-energies
to send energies out.

00:56:11.310 --> 00:56:13.840 align:middle line:84%
You can send love, in
whichever reality you are.

00:56:13.840 --> 00:56:14.640 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:56:14.640 --> 00:56:16.530 align:middle line:90%
>>MINERO: Or understanding.

00:56:16.530 --> 00:56:21.820 align:middle line:84%
And sending that out will create
a field of energies around you

00:56:21.820 --> 00:56:22.620 align:middle line:90%
of protection.

00:56:22.620 --> 00:56:26.130 align:middle line:84%
But also, if you happen
to be in a bad place,

00:56:26.130 --> 00:56:32.170 align:middle line:84%
just sending this field of
energies out, of understanding,

00:56:32.170 --> 00:56:35.700 align:middle line:84%
love, respect, because you
created this bubble of energies

00:56:35.700 --> 00:56:39.180 align:middle line:84%
that is different, this is
going to also help you to tune

00:56:39.180 --> 00:56:40.710 align:middle line:90%
into a different dimension.

00:56:40.710 --> 00:56:42.510 align:middle line:84%
And you are basically
automatically going

00:56:42.510 --> 00:56:44.745 align:middle line:84%
to be transported into
a different frequency,

00:56:44.745 --> 00:56:46.620 align:middle line:84%
because now you are in
a different frequency.

00:56:46.620 --> 00:56:47.880 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Right, but
you've created-- you've

00:56:47.880 --> 00:56:48.940 align:middle line:90%
generated that frequency.

00:56:48.940 --> 00:56:49.710 align:middle line:90%
>>MINERO: You've generated it.

00:56:49.710 --> 00:56:51.790 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And so that's
a really good idea.

00:56:51.790 --> 00:56:54.585 align:middle line:84%
If you create a
frequency of love,

00:56:54.585 --> 00:56:57.630 align:middle line:84%
of gratitude, any of
these things beforehand,

00:56:57.630 --> 00:56:59.540 align:middle line:84%
you're putting yourself
in a lighter field.

00:56:59.540 --> 00:57:00.340 align:middle line:90%
>>MINERO: Exactly.

00:57:00.340 --> 00:57:03.150 align:middle line:84%
And you can do it
beforehand, even before you

00:57:03.150 --> 00:57:04.230 align:middle line:90%
start with the practice.

00:57:04.230 --> 00:57:05.140 align:middle line:90%
That's a good point.

00:57:05.140 --> 00:57:06.900 align:middle line:84%
But you can also
do it at the moment

00:57:06.900 --> 00:57:09.570 align:middle line:84%
of the out-of-body experience,
once you're already there.

00:57:09.570 --> 00:57:12.240 align:middle line:90%
So both will certainly work.

00:57:12.240 --> 00:57:14.620 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So you lecture
around the world, right?

00:57:14.620 --> 00:57:15.670 align:middle line:90%
>>MINERO: Yes.

00:57:15.670 --> 00:57:18.780 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And you
do large classes.

00:57:18.780 --> 00:57:20.700 align:middle line:84%
Do you do individuals,
large classes?

00:57:20.700 --> 00:57:21.640 align:middle line:90%
How do you work?

00:57:21.640 --> 00:57:22.440 align:middle line:90%
>>MINERO: Both.

00:57:22.440 --> 00:57:23.975 align:middle line:90%
Large classes, small classes.

00:57:23.975 --> 00:57:25.350 align:middle line:84%
Sometimes there
have been classes

00:57:25.350 --> 00:57:28.940 align:middle line:84%
in which we have three,
four people and really,

00:57:28.940 --> 00:57:30.540 align:middle line:90%
it becomes much more friendly--

00:57:30.540 --> 00:57:32.885 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Yes, yes, indeed--
a more intimate experience.

00:57:32.885 --> 00:57:35.130 align:middle line:84%
>>MINERO: Yeah, a more
intimate experience.

00:57:35.130 --> 00:57:38.410 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Is there a physical
place for the Mosaic?

00:57:38.410 --> 00:57:41.720 align:middle line:84%
>>MINERO: Yeah, at this moment,
our headquarters for Mosaic

00:57:41.720 --> 00:57:42.630 align:middle line:90%
are in Miami.

00:57:42.630 --> 00:57:43.400 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: They're in Miami, OK.

00:57:43.400 --> 00:57:44.200 align:middle line:90%
>>MINERO: Miami.

00:57:44.200 --> 00:57:45.840 align:middle line:10%
But we give--
especially nowadays,

00:57:45.840 --> 00:57:48.060 align:middle line:10%
because everybody seems
to be going online,

00:57:48.060 --> 00:57:50.700 align:middle line:10%
we give a lot of
classes online as well,

00:57:50.700 --> 00:57:54.330 align:middle line:10%
even doing guided practices,
where the person puts

00:57:54.330 --> 00:57:55.537 align:middle line:10%
the laptop in their bedroom.

00:57:55.537 --> 00:57:56.370 align:middle line:10%
And they're at home.

00:57:56.370 --> 00:57:58.720 align:middle line:10%
And they're trying to leave
the body from their home.

00:57:58.720 --> 00:57:59.520 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:57:59.520 --> 00:58:00.820 align:middle line:90%
Well, that's convenient.

00:58:00.820 --> 00:58:02.160 align:middle line:90%
So anybody can get to you.

00:58:02.160 --> 00:58:02.400 align:middle line:90%
>>MINERO: Yeah.

00:58:02.400 --> 00:58:03.580 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Well,
thank you so much.

00:58:03.580 --> 00:58:05.040 align:middle line:84%
I really appreciate
the fact that you've

00:58:05.040 --> 00:58:07.110 align:middle line:84%
come here and shared all
this, because really--

00:58:07.110 --> 00:58:07.410 align:middle line:90%
>>MINERO: My pleasure.

00:58:07.410 --> 00:58:09.360 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: It's an
intriguing, titillating,

00:58:09.360 --> 00:58:13.300 align:middle line:84%
and I think hopeful area
for people to play with,

00:58:13.300 --> 00:58:15.570 align:middle line:84%
because you do understand
you're bigger than the body.

00:58:15.570 --> 00:58:16.830 align:middle line:90%
>>MINERO: Yeah, I think so, too.

00:58:16.830 --> 00:58:18.955 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Like you say,
just having that experience

00:58:18.955 --> 00:58:21.120 align:middle line:84%
and knowing, hey,
this is what it is?

00:58:21.120 --> 00:58:22.230 align:middle line:90%
This is who I am.

00:58:22.230 --> 00:58:23.830 align:middle line:84%
And I continue on,
no matter what.

00:58:23.830 --> 00:58:24.630 align:middle line:90%
>>MINERO: Right.

00:58:24.630 --> 00:58:28.450 align:middle line:84%
We are all much more than
what we realize that we were.

00:58:28.450 --> 00:58:29.520 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:58:29.520 --> 00:58:31.980 align:middle line:84%
Any final thought
before we sign off here?

00:58:31.980 --> 00:58:34.110 align:middle line:10%
>>MINERO: I think that
going with that one,

00:58:34.110 --> 00:58:37.680 align:middle line:10%
just we live these lives in
which we are so concerned,

00:58:37.680 --> 00:58:39.660 align:middle line:10%
obviously, with the
physical things,

00:58:39.660 --> 00:58:42.130 align:middle line:10%
with getting somewhere in
time, with our FICO score.

00:58:42.130 --> 00:58:43.090 align:middle line:90%
I joke with that--

00:58:43.090 --> 00:58:46.530 align:middle line:84%
we're always fighting for our
FICO score, our credit score.

00:58:46.530 --> 00:58:49.710 align:middle line:84%
But then the moment that you
have out-of-body experiences,

00:58:49.710 --> 00:58:52.600 align:middle line:84%
you realize, I am part of
something so much bigger.

00:58:52.600 --> 00:58:53.400 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:58:53.400 --> 00:58:54.817 align:middle line:84%
>>MINERO: I am
much more than just

00:58:54.817 --> 00:59:00.070 align:middle line:84%
simply this life, this gender,
this planet, this country.

00:59:00.070 --> 00:59:01.080 align:middle line:90%
I am so much more.

00:59:01.080 --> 00:59:02.290 align:middle line:90%
And everybody is.

00:59:02.290 --> 00:59:03.090 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:59:03.090 --> 00:59:05.693 align:middle line:84%
Well, thank you for your
good work, a lifetime of it.

00:59:05.693 --> 00:59:06.610 align:middle line:90%
>>MINERO: My pleasure.

00:59:06.610 --> 00:59:09.060 align:middle line:84%
And thank you for
the opportunity.

00:59:09.060 --> 00:59:11.010 align:middle line:10%
>>REGINA: To jump
into OBE exploration,

00:59:11.010 --> 00:59:13.710 align:middle line:10%
