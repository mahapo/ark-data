the past, I would--

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:15.320 align:middle line:84%
saw a lot of abduction phenomena
that surrounded the Grays--

00:00:15.320 --> 00:00:18.140 align:middle line:84%
tall grays, short
grays, reptilians.

00:00:18.140 --> 00:00:20.630 align:middle line:84%
What's happening is it's
more of a consciousness

00:00:20.630 --> 00:00:24.800 align:middle line:84%
hijacking, where the
consciousness is separated

00:00:24.800 --> 00:00:25.760 align:middle line:90%
from the body.

Laurie McDonald with us,

00:01:03.050 --> 00:01:06.280 align:middle line:10%
she captivated our audience with
her experiences in hypnotizing

00:01:06.280 --> 00:01:08.960 align:middle line:10%
people who felt they have had
contact with aliens or were

00:01:08.960 --> 00:01:09.760 align:middle line:10%
abducted.

00:01:09.760 --> 00:01:12.010 align:middle line:84%
Today, we're going to continue
that story a little bit

00:01:12.010 --> 00:01:14.470 align:middle line:84%
and we're going to drill
down even further, and even

00:01:14.470 --> 00:01:16.880 align:middle line:84%
go into the subject of
disclosure for a little bit

00:01:16.880 --> 00:01:17.680 align:middle line:90%
because it's up.

00:01:17.680 --> 00:01:19.450 align:middle line:84%
You know, 20th
anniversary happened,

00:01:19.450 --> 00:01:21.340 align:middle line:84%
you and I are both
on UFO panels,

00:01:21.340 --> 00:01:23.560 align:middle line:84%
everybody's trying
to contend with it

00:01:23.560 --> 00:01:26.470 align:middle line:84%
and manipulate the
information, massage it

00:01:26.470 --> 00:01:30.160 align:middle line:84%
in their own way for their own
purposes, and this is complex.

00:01:30.160 --> 00:01:32.110 align:middle line:84%
But before we do
all of that, I think

00:01:32.110 --> 00:01:34.630 align:middle line:84%
the most fun thing
in talking to you

00:01:34.630 --> 00:01:37.960 align:middle line:84%
is you're always out
there doing something

00:01:37.960 --> 00:01:39.970 align:middle line:90%
far out, new, different.

00:01:39.970 --> 00:01:42.250 align:middle line:84%
Unfortunately, half
the things you do,

00:01:42.250 --> 00:01:44.230 align:middle line:84%
you won't tell me
about because you

00:01:44.230 --> 00:01:47.030 align:middle line:84%
say you have a nondisclosure
agreement or something.

00:01:47.030 --> 00:01:49.030 align:middle line:84%
But we're going
to do what we can

00:01:49.030 --> 00:01:51.560 align:middle line:84%
considering that you're kind
of tight lipped on some things,

00:01:51.560 --> 00:01:52.360 align:middle line:90%
OK?

00:01:52.360 --> 00:01:53.160 align:middle line:90%

00:01:55.115 --> 00:01:56.740 align:middle line:84%
first of all, I want
to know one thing.

You were dealing with
clients all the time,

00:01:59.820 --> 00:02:02.560 align:middle line:84%
how has the story changed
or has it changed?

What's different
compared to your hypnosis

00:02:06.720 --> 00:02:10.280 align:middle line:84%
clients of the past
in these stories?

00:02:10.280 --> 00:02:14.540 align:middle line:10%
>> Well, I have been doing the
regression sessions to retrieve

00:02:14.540 --> 00:02:17.780 align:middle line:10%
memories that have been
suppressed or memories that

00:02:17.780 --> 00:02:20.060 align:middle line:10%
a person only has a glimpse of.

00:02:20.060 --> 00:02:22.620 align:middle line:10%
But this memory will
be so powerful--

00:02:22.620 --> 00:02:26.900 align:middle line:10%
so strong, it will come to mind
maybe every day or every week

00:02:26.900 --> 00:02:28.110 align:middle line:10%
over years.

00:02:28.110 --> 00:02:29.780 align:middle line:84%
And so finally gets
to a point where

00:02:29.780 --> 00:02:32.345 align:middle line:84%
they need to find out
what happened to me,

00:02:32.345 --> 00:02:34.670 align:middle line:84%
and so they'll come in and
we'll do the regression

00:02:34.670 --> 00:02:37.160 align:middle line:90%
session for memory retrieval.

00:02:37.160 --> 00:02:41.570 align:middle line:84%

I'm going to say,

00:02:49.940 --> 00:02:52.110 align:middle line:90%
maybe the last three years--

00:02:52.110 --> 00:02:55.340 align:middle line:84%
First off, over the last
year during this pandemic,

00:02:55.340 --> 00:02:59.580 align:middle line:84%
there have been more UFOs
reported than ever before.

00:03:16.250 --> 00:03:22.590 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, so what we're seeing,
really what's changing is,

00:03:22.590 --> 00:03:25.330 align:middle line:84%
as a person becomes
more empowered,

00:03:25.330 --> 00:03:29.070 align:middle line:84%
more self accepting of the
existence of non-human entities

00:03:29.070 --> 00:03:32.100 align:middle line:84%
when they expand their
consciousness to the point

00:03:32.100 --> 00:03:36.330 align:middle line:84%
where they're beginning to
see that it all has to do with

00:03:36.330 --> 00:03:37.380 align:middle line:90%
them.

00:03:37.380 --> 00:03:39.728 align:middle line:84%
That this really is an
individual experience.

00:03:39.728 --> 00:03:41.520 align:middle line:84%
And people ask me all
the time, well, then,

00:03:41.520 --> 00:03:43.780 align:middle line:84%
how come they're just not
landing on the White House

00:03:43.780 --> 00:03:44.580 align:middle line:90%

00:03:45.030 --> 00:03:46.110 align:middle line:90%

00:03:46.110 --> 00:03:46.710 align:middle line:90%
And-- [LAUGHS]

00:03:46.710 --> 00:03:47.490 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:03:47.490 --> 00:03:49.157 align:middle line:84%
>>MCDONALD: And
secondly, I think that--

00:03:49.157 --> 00:03:51.490 align:middle line:84%
>> And flew over it, and have
all been captured on film.

00:03:51.490 --> 00:03:52.290 align:middle line:90%

>> And even prior to that--

00:03:54.195 --> 00:03:54.995 align:middle line:90%
>> Exactly.

00:03:54.995 --> 00:03:58.020 align:middle line:84%
>> I mean, we just had that
anniversary in LA where there

00:03:58.020 --> 00:03:58.977 align:middle line:90%
was a UFO.

00:03:58.977 --> 00:04:00.060 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah, it was a big one.

00:04:00.060 --> 00:04:01.260 align:middle line:90%
That was an interesting one.

00:04:01.260 --> 00:04:02.550 align:middle line:90%
>> And what did they do?

00:04:02.550 --> 00:04:05.250 align:middle line:84%
I think what they were saying
over the loudspeakers were,

00:04:05.250 --> 00:04:07.240 align:middle line:90%
people of LA, do not fire upon!

00:04:10.710 --> 00:04:13.270 align:middle line:84%
>> I can see everybody in the

00:04:13.270 --> 00:04:14.070 align:middle line:90%
I forgot my gun.

00:04:14.070 --> 00:04:14.550 align:middle line:90%

>>REGINA: Mm-hmm.

00:04:21.160 --> 00:04:23.010 align:middle line:84%
>> And I think what
that has to do is--

00:04:23.010 --> 00:04:26.178 align:middle line:84%
so it's not an en
masse disclosure,

00:04:26.178 --> 00:04:27.720 align:middle line:84%
which is what people
are looking for.

00:04:27.720 --> 00:04:28.520 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: No!

00:04:28.520 --> 00:04:30.720 align:middle line:84%
>> We've had this soft
disclosure on an individual

00:04:30.720 --> 00:04:36.030 align:middle line:84%
basis because those people are
ready to look at themselves.

00:04:36.030 --> 00:04:38.820 align:middle line:84%
All of the extraterrestrials,
all of the reports,

00:04:38.820 --> 00:04:42.210 align:middle line:84%
all of the channeling,
everything that happens,

00:04:42.210 --> 00:04:44.630 align:middle line:84%
all of that interest
is in the humans.

00:04:44.630 --> 00:04:45.430 align:middle line:90%
>> Right.

00:04:45.430 --> 00:04:47.550 align:middle line:84%
And this is the part of
the story that's always

00:04:47.550 --> 00:04:50.880 align:middle line:84%
dismissed in favor
of the more academic

00:04:50.880 --> 00:04:54.690 align:middle line:84%
and the technological aspects
of it, and also the warlike

fright scenarios.

00:04:56.170 --> 00:04:56.970 align:middle line:90%
>> Absolutely.

00:04:56.970 --> 00:04:58.012 align:middle line:90%
Are they going to invade?

00:04:58.012 --> 00:04:58.950 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:04:58.950 --> 00:05:00.450 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah, some more academia.

00:05:00.450 --> 00:05:01.830 align:middle line:90%
There'd be like, what craft?

00:05:01.830 --> 00:05:03.122 align:middle line:90%
You know, what does it made of?

00:05:03.122 --> 00:05:04.440 align:middle line:90%
Can we reverse engineer that?

00:05:04.440 --> 00:05:05.940 align:middle line:90%
How did the antigravatics work?

00:05:05.940 --> 00:05:07.200 align:middle line:90%
>> Exactly.

00:05:07.200 --> 00:05:08.942 align:middle line:84%
>> Antigravatic,
that's how it works.

00:05:08.942 --> 00:05:09.900 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Mm-hmm, yeah.

00:05:09.900 --> 00:05:10.897 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHTER]

00:05:10.897 --> 00:05:11.730 align:middle line:90%
>> Self-explanatory.

00:05:11.730 --> 00:05:14.770 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: But the people
part gets lost in the story,

00:05:14.770 --> 00:05:17.490 align:middle line:84%
and this is the people--
they're trying to reach us.

00:05:17.490 --> 00:05:21.660 align:middle line:84%
>> What they're teaching us
is the multidimensionality

00:05:21.660 --> 00:05:22.980 align:middle line:90%
of the human soul.

00:05:22.980 --> 00:05:25.170 align:middle line:90%
It really comes down to that.

00:05:25.170 --> 00:05:28.440 align:middle line:84%
I know that we're
very young and naive,

00:05:28.440 --> 00:05:29.940 align:middle line:90%
running around like scissors

00:05:29.940 --> 00:05:30.930 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Mm-hmm.

00:05:30.930 --> 00:05:33.690 align:middle line:84%
>> Thinking that, oh,
we've got technology,

00:05:33.690 --> 00:05:39.580 align:middle line:84%
we've sent a probe to Mars or a
Rover, and all of these things,

00:05:39.580 --> 00:05:41.830 align:middle line:90%
but we're missing the point.

00:05:41.830 --> 00:05:47.670 align:middle line:84%
The point is that the human
experience in the human soul,

00:05:47.670 --> 00:05:50.010 align:middle line:84%
having that multi
dimensionality,

00:05:50.010 --> 00:05:53.010 align:middle line:84%
teaches us that each
experience that we

00:05:53.010 --> 00:05:57.400 align:middle line:84%
have has to be reflected
on our own conscious level.

00:05:57.400 --> 00:06:01.170 align:middle line:84%
Not just the
hybridization program

00:06:01.170 --> 00:06:04.057 align:middle line:84%
and what that agenda
might look like.

00:06:04.057 --> 00:06:05.640 align:middle line:84%
And we have an idea
of what that might

00:06:05.640 --> 00:06:07.590 align:middle line:84%
look like, we know that
a lot of the hybrids

00:06:07.590 --> 00:06:11.040 align:middle line:84%
have issues with their lungs,
they weren't breathing well,

00:06:11.040 --> 00:06:13.230 align:middle line:90%
there were some adaptive issues.

00:06:13.230 --> 00:06:16.170 align:middle line:84%
Not like us humans,
were highly adaptable

00:06:16.170 --> 00:06:19.060 align:middle line:84%
and can pretty much adapt
into any environment.

00:06:19.060 --> 00:06:19.860 align:middle line:90%
>> Mm-hmm.

00:06:19.860 --> 00:06:22.620 align:middle line:90%
>> But it's really about us.

00:06:22.620 --> 00:06:25.830 align:middle line:84%
When we begin to understand
the human, you know,

00:06:25.830 --> 00:06:30.540 align:middle line:84%
the light embodied entity as the
true definition of human is--

00:06:30.540 --> 00:06:32.490 align:middle line:84%
that's not race,
it's not people.

00:06:32.490 --> 00:06:34.950 align:middle line:84%
Hue is that word
we use to measure

00:06:34.950 --> 00:06:38.400 align:middle line:84%
the light, or depth, or
saturation of light-- we

00:06:38.400 --> 00:06:39.330 align:middle line:90%
measure that in hues.

00:06:39.330 --> 00:06:39.810 align:middle line:90%
>> Mm-hmm.

00:06:39.810 --> 00:06:41.730 align:middle line:84%
>>MCDONALD: Man comes
from manifestation

00:06:41.730 --> 00:06:44.370 align:middle line:84%
to come into the physical
or to be embodied.

00:06:44.370 --> 00:06:47.370 align:middle line:84%
A human is a light
and bodied being.

00:06:47.370 --> 00:06:51.480 align:middle line:84%
And race and gender being
subcategories of that,

00:06:51.480 --> 00:06:56.130 align:middle line:84%
we begin to understand that the
aspect, the hue, the light part

00:06:56.130 --> 00:06:57.310 align:middle line:90%
is continuous.

00:06:57.310 --> 00:06:58.110 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA : Right

00:06:58.110 --> 00:06:59.910 align:middle line:90%
>>MCDONALD: Multidimensional.

00:06:59.910 --> 00:07:03.090 align:middle line:84%
And we're looking at parallel
universes a lot right now.

00:07:03.090 --> 00:07:03.900 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Exactly!

00:07:03.900 --> 00:07:07.030 align:middle line:84%
>> Parallel realities on
a personal level as well.

00:07:07.030 --> 00:07:09.060 align:middle line:84%
>> But before we go on
past the point there,

00:07:09.060 --> 00:07:11.580 align:middle line:84%
were you saying they're
helping humanity to understand

00:07:11.580 --> 00:07:13.380 align:middle line:84%
the nature of our
multidimensionality

00:07:13.380 --> 00:07:17.661 align:middle line:84%
and our source light,
what we actually are?

00:07:17.661 --> 00:07:20.940 align:middle line:84%
What are they intrigued
with about humanity?

00:07:20.940 --> 00:07:22.740 align:middle line:90%
Because we're not normal.

00:07:22.740 --> 00:07:25.185 align:middle line:90%
>> No, we're beautiful.

00:07:25.185 --> 00:07:26.310 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: We are beautiful.

00:07:26.310 --> 00:07:26.850 align:middle line:90%
We're not--

00:07:26.850 --> 00:07:27.650 align:middle line:90%
>> And tragic.

00:07:27.650 --> 00:07:28.830 align:middle line:90%
>> --normal out there.

00:07:28.830 --> 00:07:31.290 align:middle line:84%
All of the above,
so tell us what

00:07:31.290 --> 00:07:35.640 align:middle line:84%
you learn about what others are
intrigued with regarding us?

00:07:35.640 --> 00:07:39.000 align:middle line:84%
>> Our ability to
heal, to be honest.

00:07:39.000 --> 00:07:42.150 align:middle line:84%
They are always
impressed or fascinated

00:07:42.150 --> 00:07:47.340 align:middle line:84%
when a person can
overcome the circumstances

00:07:47.340 --> 00:07:49.920 align:middle line:90%
or fates of their life.

00:07:49.920 --> 00:07:53.070 align:middle line:84%
A lot of bad things happen
to a lot of innocent people,

00:07:53.070 --> 00:07:54.690 align:middle line:90%
but those are just things.

00:07:54.690 --> 00:07:57.570 align:middle line:84%
Those are circumstances of your
life, they're not your life,

00:07:57.570 --> 00:07:58.750 align:middle line:90%
they're not who you are.

00:07:58.750 --> 00:07:59.550 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:07:59.550 --> 00:08:01.360 align:middle line:90%
>> They're not what you can be.

00:08:01.360 --> 00:08:04.590 align:middle line:84%
And so we mustn't allow
them to dampen that ability

00:08:04.590 --> 00:08:06.720 align:middle line:90%
to sense our own potential.

00:08:06.720 --> 00:08:09.360 align:middle line:84%
But through healing
and hypnotherapy,

00:08:09.360 --> 00:08:12.340 align:middle line:84%
we begin to integrate
the mind, the body,

00:08:12.340 --> 00:08:14.160 align:middle line:90%
and the soul, that light.

00:08:14.160 --> 00:08:19.230 align:middle line:84%
So we do feel that potential,
we begin to see what it is

00:08:19.230 --> 00:08:21.150 align:middle line:90%
and why we're here.

00:08:21.150 --> 00:08:23.700 align:middle line:84%
And with that, we're
answering already what we are.

00:08:23.700 --> 00:08:25.410 align:middle line:90%
Once you know what you are--

00:08:25.410 --> 00:08:26.250 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:08:26.250 --> 00:08:30.090 align:middle line:84%
>> --then the other questions
begin to answer themselves.

00:08:30.090 --> 00:08:31.140 align:middle line:90%
>> They do.

00:08:31.140 --> 00:08:33.809 align:middle line:84%
However, they are still
intrigued with us--

00:08:33.809 --> 00:08:34.919 align:middle line:90%
it's a two way street.

00:08:34.919 --> 00:08:36.450 align:middle line:84%
And another thing,
my understanding

00:08:36.450 --> 00:08:38.820 align:middle line:84%
is that there are so
many humanoid species

00:08:38.820 --> 00:08:40.140 align:middle line:90%
throughout the cosmos.

00:08:40.140 --> 00:08:43.860 align:middle line:84%
And that one of the things
that many of those species

00:08:43.860 --> 00:08:50.020 align:middle line:84%
are intrigued with is also our
incredibly seemingly limitless

00:08:50.020 --> 00:08:51.710 align:middle line:90%
potentials for creativity.

00:08:51.710 --> 00:08:52.510 align:middle line:90%
>> Well, right.

00:08:52.510 --> 00:08:56.770 align:middle line:84%
The planet Earth, and
frankly, the third dimension--

00:08:56.770 --> 00:08:57.650 align:middle line:90%
all third dimensions.

00:08:57.650 --> 00:08:58.450 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Mm-hmm.

00:08:58.450 --> 00:09:00.367 align:middle line:84%
>> So there's a series
of Earth-like planets--

00:09:00.367 --> 00:09:01.167 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:09:01.167 --> 00:09:02.230 align:middle line:90%
>> --third dimensionally.

00:09:02.230 --> 00:09:05.020 align:middle line:84%
And we are highly
creative, let's face it,

00:09:05.020 --> 00:09:10.180 align:middle line:84%
we took rock from the ground
and turned it into steel

00:09:10.180 --> 00:09:11.740 align:middle line:84%
and we made cars,
and then we made

00:09:11.740 --> 00:09:14.032 align:middle line:84%
rocket ships-- isn't it funny
it's still called "rock."

00:09:14.032 --> 00:09:16.360 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHTER]

00:09:16.360 --> 00:09:17.800 align:middle line:90%
I'm easily amused.

00:09:17.800 --> 00:09:21.100 align:middle line:84%
But it was still called a
rocket, and we did all of this,

00:09:21.100 --> 00:09:23.645 align:middle line:84%
and we created everything
from the natural resources

00:09:23.645 --> 00:09:25.270 align:middle line:84%
that we have, so
we're highly-creative.

00:09:25.270 --> 00:09:26.076 align:middle line:90%
>> To pet rocks.

00:09:26.076 --> 00:09:27.243 align:middle line:90%
>> (CHUCKLING) To pet rocks.

00:09:27.243 --> 00:09:28.030 align:middle line:90%
>> Who would've thought?

00:09:28.030 --> 00:09:28.862 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHTER]

00:09:28.862 --> 00:09:30.070 align:middle line:90%
I didn't see that one coming.

00:09:30.070 --> 00:09:31.240 align:middle line:84%
>>MCDONALD: But
everything's alive.

00:09:31.240 --> 00:09:32.448 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah, everything is alive.

00:09:32.448 --> 00:09:35.230 align:middle line:90%
But I mean, this is something.

00:09:35.230 --> 00:09:37.210 align:middle line:84%
Even if you go to
something, you know,

00:09:37.210 --> 00:09:40.720 align:middle line:84%
GoFundMe, Etsy, any of these
sites, the things people--

00:09:40.720 --> 00:09:42.530 align:middle line:90%
human beings come up with.

00:09:42.530 --> 00:09:44.530 align:middle line:84%
And they say, there's
nothing new under the sun.

00:09:44.530 --> 00:09:46.640 align:middle line:84%
Maybe not, but it
sure looks like it.

00:09:46.640 --> 00:09:48.460 align:middle line:84%
And so I would
think there must be

00:09:48.460 --> 00:09:54.280 align:middle line:84%
some curiosity about
our incredible diversity

00:09:54.280 --> 00:09:56.380 align:middle line:84%
in our ability to
heal as you say

00:09:56.380 --> 00:09:58.900 align:middle line:84%
and transform ourself
with mind matrix,

00:09:58.900 --> 00:10:02.170 align:middle line:84%
to the incredibly beautiful
things and interesting things

00:10:02.170 --> 00:10:03.910 align:middle line:90%
we come up with for good or bad.

00:10:03.910 --> 00:10:05.110 align:middle line:90%
>> For good or bad.

00:10:05.110 --> 00:10:07.300 align:middle line:84%
And we're kind of
accelerating quickly,

00:10:07.300 --> 00:10:10.210 align:middle line:84%
and we have an idea
that maybe the shadow

00:10:10.210 --> 00:10:12.332 align:middle line:84%
or the black governments,
or a good 50, 60 years

00:10:12.332 --> 00:10:14.290 align:middle line:84%
advanced in the technology
that we're aware of.

00:10:14.290 --> 00:10:15.550 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, that's where
they've always said.

00:10:15.550 --> 00:10:16.350 align:middle line:90%
Yup.

00:10:16.350 --> 00:10:19.435 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, we see that when they
create sci-fi movies 30 or 40

00:10:19.435 --> 00:10:20.235 align:middle line:90%
years ago.

00:10:20.235 --> 00:10:20.360 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Absolutely.

00:10:20.360 --> 00:10:21.175 align:middle line:90%
>> And they have a flip phone.

00:10:21.175 --> 00:10:22.337 align:middle line:90%
And we'll probably have an idea.

00:10:22.337 --> 00:10:23.962 align:middle line:84%
>> Called predictive
programming, yeah.

00:10:23.962 --> 00:10:26.170 align:middle line:84%
>> Predictive programming
or maybe they know.

00:10:26.170 --> 00:10:27.530 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah, exactly.

00:10:27.530 --> 00:10:29.170 align:middle line:90%
>> And so--

00:10:29.170 --> 00:10:31.510 align:middle line:84%
Yeah, technology is
far more advanced.

00:10:31.510 --> 00:10:34.090 align:middle line:84%
I think it's very
important right now

00:10:34.090 --> 00:10:37.390 align:middle line:84%
that we balance
technology, especially

00:10:37.390 --> 00:10:38.900 align:middle line:90%
artificial intelligence.

00:10:38.900 --> 00:10:42.580 align:middle line:84%
Artificial intelligence
is frightening.

00:10:42.580 --> 00:10:46.210 align:middle line:84%
I'm not afraid of much, in
fact, off the top of my head,

00:10:46.210 --> 00:10:50.860 align:middle line:84%
that would be about the only
thing that creates any anxiety

00:10:50.860 --> 00:10:55.930 align:middle line:84%
or fear inside of me because
AI or quantum computing

00:10:55.930 --> 00:10:58.790 align:middle line:90%
doesn't think like a human.

00:10:58.790 --> 00:11:04.180 align:middle line:84%
So say, they see a specific
race of people not flourishing.

00:11:04.180 --> 00:11:07.780 align:middle line:84%
Their idea wouldn't be to
teach, encourage growth,

00:11:07.780 --> 00:11:09.110 align:middle line:90%
it would be to dismiss.

00:11:09.110 --> 00:11:09.910 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:11:09.910 --> 00:11:11.170 align:middle line:90%
>> Or wipe out.

00:11:11.170 --> 00:11:12.212 align:middle line:90%
>> For efficiency's sake.

00:11:12.212 --> 00:11:13.628 align:middle line:84%
>>MCDONALD: For
efficiency's sake.

00:11:13.628 --> 00:11:15.250 align:middle line:90%
>> From a robotic model of mind.

00:11:15.250 --> 00:11:18.590 align:middle line:84%
>> And that would be accurate
on their way of thinking.

00:11:18.590 --> 00:11:20.740 align:middle line:84%
And so bringing
artificial intelligence

00:11:20.740 --> 00:11:24.720 align:middle line:90%
into our intelligence might--

00:11:24.720 --> 00:11:26.550 align:middle line:84%
it's going to take
quite a balancing act,

00:11:26.550 --> 00:11:30.810 align:middle line:84%
and I think that we have
to be prepared to slow down

00:11:30.810 --> 00:11:33.700 align:middle line:84%
a little bit and
stop and say, well,

00:11:33.700 --> 00:11:35.880 align:middle line:84%
is this something
we really want?

00:11:35.880 --> 00:11:37.560 align:middle line:90%
Do I really need 5G?

00:11:37.560 --> 00:11:39.275 align:middle line:90%
Wasn't 4G good enough?

00:11:39.275 --> 00:11:40.900 align:middle line:84%
>> We're good, 4 is
good enough for me.

00:11:40.900 --> 00:11:42.150 align:middle line:90%
>> Was good enough for me too.

00:11:42.150 --> 00:11:44.192 align:middle line:84%
>> Yeah I know, and I'm
with you the whole notion

00:11:44.192 --> 00:11:46.000 align:middle line:84%
of the intrusion of
AI into our lives.

00:11:46.000 --> 00:11:48.810 align:middle line:84%
And I just did a show with
Ben Stewart on this recently

00:11:48.810 --> 00:11:52.770 align:middle line:84%
and others is
highly problematic,

00:11:52.770 --> 00:11:54.720 align:middle line:84%
we all come to the
same place on it.

00:11:54.720 --> 00:12:00.000 align:middle line:84%
And that and the breakdown
of any kind of genuine

00:12:00.000 --> 00:12:02.970 align:middle line:84%
long held empirical truth
at this moment in time

00:12:02.970 --> 00:12:05.820 align:middle line:84%
are the two things
that frighten me.

00:12:05.820 --> 00:12:07.090 align:middle line:90%
>> Well, change is coming.

00:12:07.090 --> 00:12:07.890 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:12:07.890 --> 00:12:11.365 align:middle line:84%
>> You know, we've already
experienced an enormous amount

00:12:11.365 --> 00:12:12.165 align:middle line:90%
of change.

00:12:12.165 --> 00:12:12.965 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Mm-hmm.

00:12:12.965 --> 00:12:18.240 align:middle line:84%
>> And with what looks like
a little less than soft

00:12:18.240 --> 00:12:21.110 align:middle line:84%
disclosure perhaps happening
at later this summer.

00:12:21.110 --> 00:12:21.910 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHS]

00:12:21.910 --> 00:12:22.890 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:12:22.890 --> 00:12:23.850 align:middle line:90%
>> Less than solemn.

00:12:23.850 --> 00:12:24.650 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:12:24.650 --> 00:12:27.520 align:middle line:84%
>> But yeah, we will be
having that to deal with.

00:12:27.520 --> 00:12:28.320 align:middle line:90%
>> Mm-hmm.

00:12:28.320 --> 00:12:30.270 align:middle line:84%
>> On a world level,
it's interesting--

00:12:30.270 --> 00:12:31.840 align:middle line:84%
>> Now, talk about
that a little bit.

00:12:31.840 --> 00:12:32.640 align:middle line:90%
>> Well--

00:12:32.640 --> 00:12:34.050 align:middle line:90%
>> What you mean by that.

00:12:34.050 --> 00:12:36.030 align:middle line:84%
Less than soft
disclosure coming.

00:12:36.030 --> 00:12:39.750 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, with the release
of the, you know, the very--

00:12:39.750 --> 00:12:43.830 align:middle line:84%
>> You're saying if UAP
task force actually releases

00:12:43.830 --> 00:12:46.410 align:middle line:84%
anything, so is that's
what you're talking about?

00:12:46.410 --> 00:12:47.920 align:middle line:90%
The release of that information?

00:12:47.920 --> 00:12:50.430 align:middle line:84%
>> I think that we're going
to probably have a little bit

00:12:50.430 --> 00:12:52.572 align:middle line:90%
higher up release than that.

00:12:52.572 --> 00:12:53.780 align:middle line:90%
>> That would be interesting.

00:12:53.780 --> 00:12:59.160 align:middle line:84%
>> That maybe be a United
Nations meeting where the world

00:12:59.160 --> 00:13:04.100 align:middle line:84%
comes together to create
the opening to say, look,

00:13:04.100 --> 00:13:07.510 align:middle line:84%
we have throughout our history
and, for a very long time,

00:13:07.510 --> 00:13:11.980 align:middle line:84%
seen unidentified flying
objects, or ABCs, or UFOs,

00:13:11.980 --> 00:13:14.650 align:middle line:84%
whatever you're most
comfortable calling them.

00:13:14.650 --> 00:13:16.600 align:middle line:84%
And now, we're
beginning to learn

00:13:16.600 --> 00:13:18.190 align:middle line:90%
that they may not be from here.

00:13:18.190 --> 00:13:21.520 align:middle line:84%
I think that we're going
to get a little soft story,

00:13:21.520 --> 00:13:23.680 align:middle line:84%
but it's going to be
one that everybody

00:13:23.680 --> 00:13:24.670 align:middle line:90%
won't be able to deny.

00:13:24.670 --> 00:13:26.540 align:middle line:84%
I mean, Sunday night
was 60 minutes.

00:13:26.540 --> 00:13:27.340 align:middle line:90%
>> 60 minutes.

00:13:27.340 --> 00:13:28.140 align:middle line:90%
>>MCDONALD: Right.

00:13:28.140 --> 00:13:31.120 align:middle line:84%
I mean, so we are seeing
it-- football players coming.

00:13:31.120 --> 00:13:35.950 align:middle line:84%
It's happening, and once
it's worldwide, say,

00:13:35.950 --> 00:13:37.610 align:middle line:84%
through a United
Nations meeting,

00:13:37.610 --> 00:13:40.960 align:middle line:84%
which is what I feel
is will be the way,

00:13:40.960 --> 00:13:43.210 align:middle line:84%
can't just be one
government because

00:13:43.210 --> 00:13:47.350 align:middle line:84%
the destructive
dispersion of power

00:13:47.350 --> 00:13:52.030 align:middle line:84%
will shift once we begin
to see that globally.

00:13:52.030 --> 00:13:56.980 align:middle line:84%
Between China, and North Korea,
Russia, and the United States,

00:13:56.980 --> 00:14:03.820 align:middle line:84%
when we begin to look at talking
about unidentified occupants

00:14:03.820 --> 00:14:07.490 align:middle line:84%
of craft interacting with
government agencies--

00:14:07.490 --> 00:14:08.530 align:middle line:90%
>> Mm-hmm, Mm-hmm.

00:14:08.530 --> 00:14:12.400 align:middle line:84%
>> Then we're going to be vying
for that because it's really

00:14:12.400 --> 00:14:15.500 align:middle line:84%
going to be initially
what can you give me.

00:14:15.500 --> 00:14:16.300 align:middle line:90%
>> Right.

00:14:16.300 --> 00:14:19.140 align:middle line:84%
And last week, I was talking
to Daniel Sheehan, right?

00:14:19.140 --> 00:14:19.940 align:middle line:90%
>>MCDONALD: Yeah.

00:14:19.940 --> 00:14:23.440 align:middle line:84%
>> And I said, come on,
Danny, at 75 years later,

00:14:23.440 --> 00:14:27.280 align:middle line:84%
why is this not simply being
allowed to come to the surface

00:14:27.280 --> 00:14:28.450 align:middle line:90%
known into public awareness?

00:14:28.450 --> 00:14:29.590 align:middle line:90%
>> And what did he say?

00:14:29.590 --> 00:14:30.910 align:middle line:90%
>> Well, you know what he said?

00:14:30.910 --> 00:14:34.690 align:middle line:84%
Was he said, it is
purely for purposes

00:14:34.690 --> 00:14:36.080 align:middle line:90%
of future holding of power.

00:14:36.080 --> 00:14:36.880 align:middle line:90%
>>MCDONALD: Mhm.

00:14:36.880 --> 00:14:37.900 align:middle line:90%
>> Between the countries.

00:14:37.900 --> 00:14:38.700 align:middle line:90%
>>MCDONALD: It is.

00:14:38.700 --> 00:14:40.960 align:middle line:84%
>> That it is a power
grab of dominance.

00:14:40.960 --> 00:14:44.540 align:middle line:84%
And he said that, that is the
sole reason in his opinion--

00:14:44.540 --> 00:14:45.340 align:middle line:90%
>> I agree.

00:14:45.340 --> 00:14:47.510 align:middle line:84%
>> --why that's
not being released.

00:14:47.510 --> 00:14:50.530 align:middle line:84%
And so I was hearing him-- also,
there was another person there

00:14:50.530 --> 00:14:53.307 align:middle line:84%
and they're asking questions
and chatting and he said,

00:14:53.307 --> 00:14:55.390 align:middle line:84%
I don't think this disclosure
that they're talking

00:14:55.390 --> 00:14:56.510 align:middle line:90%
about is going to happen.

00:14:56.510 --> 00:14:59.010 align:middle line:84%
They'll say, well, we're going
to have a little delay in it.

00:14:59.010 --> 00:15:02.163 align:middle line:84%
Now, that's the American
unidentified aerial phenomena

00:15:02.163 --> 00:15:03.580 align:middle line:84%
project that they
say, we're going

00:15:03.580 --> 00:15:06.010 align:middle line:84%
to give you our
military findings

00:15:06.010 --> 00:15:10.070 align:middle line:84%
and tell you the truth,
which is supposed to happen.

00:15:10.070 --> 00:15:13.240 align:middle line:84%
He says he does not see that
happening for the same reasons

00:15:13.240 --> 00:15:14.150 align:middle line:90%
as mentioned above.

00:15:14.150 --> 00:15:16.390 align:middle line:84%
You know is they'll say, there's
a little delay or something

00:15:16.390 --> 00:15:17.190 align:middle line:90%
like that.

00:15:17.190 --> 00:15:19.960 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, I think that a
United Nations meeting--

00:15:19.960 --> 00:15:21.220 align:middle line:90%
>> Mm-hmm.

00:15:21.220 --> 00:15:23.560 align:middle line:84%
>> --where they will,
among themselves,

00:15:23.560 --> 00:15:26.050 align:middle line:90%
either change the power.

00:15:26.050 --> 00:15:27.050 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA : Mm-hmm.

00:15:27.050 --> 00:15:29.050 align:middle line:84%
>> But that's what it is,
he's absolutely right.

00:15:29.050 --> 00:15:30.670 align:middle line:90%
It always comes down to that.

00:15:30.670 --> 00:15:32.560 align:middle line:84%
>> And so it's been
said for 20 years now.

00:15:32.560 --> 00:15:33.640 align:middle line:90%
>> It's powers.

00:15:33.640 --> 00:15:37.180 align:middle line:84%
>> Everyone says it comes down
to he who has ever been able

00:15:37.180 --> 00:15:41.620 align:middle line:84%
to capture whatever remnants
and technology work with them

00:15:41.620 --> 00:15:44.260 align:middle line:84%
to the extent they're
successful, back engineer them,

00:15:44.260 --> 00:15:45.880 align:middle line:90%
that that's what it's all about.

00:15:45.880 --> 00:15:48.100 align:middle line:84%
He who has the most
advanced technology

00:15:48.100 --> 00:15:49.900 align:middle line:84%
wins, and they're
not going to share.

00:15:49.900 --> 00:15:51.070 align:middle line:90%
>> And that's the problem.

00:15:51.070 --> 00:15:51.870 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:15:51.870 --> 00:15:53.700 align:middle line:84%
>> Because that isn't
what it's all about.

00:15:53.700 --> 00:15:54.500 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: No.

00:15:54.500 --> 00:15:58.300 align:middle line:84%
>> OK, if we're all interested
in their shiny new stuff,

00:15:58.300 --> 00:16:00.590 align:middle line:90%
then we're missing the point.

00:16:00.590 --> 00:16:04.570 align:middle line:84%
The point is really about the
expansion of consciousness

00:16:04.570 --> 00:16:09.590 align:middle line:84%
and the people of the
Earth being able to rise--

00:16:09.590 --> 00:16:10.390 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Mm-hmm.

00:16:10.390 --> 00:16:13.990 align:middle line:84%
>> --into that understanding
to limit their fear and begin

00:16:13.990 --> 00:16:17.110 align:middle line:84%
to ask the very big
questions about, well,

00:16:17.110 --> 00:16:19.700 align:middle line:84%
what might this mean
for me or my family?

00:16:19.700 --> 00:16:21.970 align:middle line:90%
What is our next empowered step?

00:16:21.970 --> 00:16:25.117 align:middle line:84%
So they tell us there
are aliens have always

00:16:25.117 --> 00:16:26.200 align:middle line:90%
been coming to the planet.

00:16:26.200 --> 00:16:27.000 align:middle line:90%
>> Mm-hmm.

00:16:27.000 --> 00:16:29.680 align:middle line:84%
>> And that they're going to be
making it a lot more evident.

00:16:29.680 --> 00:16:31.300 align:middle line:90%
But what does this mean?

00:16:31.300 --> 00:16:32.260 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Mm-hmm.

00:16:32.260 --> 00:16:33.860 align:middle line:90%
>> How will things change?

00:16:33.860 --> 00:16:35.440 align:middle line:84%
So one of the things
that we're going

00:16:35.440 --> 00:16:38.810 align:middle line:84%
to be looking at, obviously,
is infrastructure, energy--

00:16:38.810 --> 00:16:39.610 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Energy.

00:16:39.610 --> 00:16:40.410 align:middle line:90%
>> and power.

00:16:40.410 --> 00:16:42.850 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Mm-hmm.

00:16:42.850 --> 00:16:45.280 align:middle line:84%
Where do you think
Elon Musk is from?

00:16:45.280 --> 00:16:46.870 align:middle line:84%
He said the funniest
thing lately.

00:16:46.870 --> 00:16:47.950 align:middle line:90%
I'm a fan, OK?

00:16:47.950 --> 00:16:51.070 align:middle line:84%
I've got Tesla batteries
all over my roof

00:16:51.070 --> 00:16:52.690 align:middle line:90%
and have one on the cars.

00:16:52.690 --> 00:16:55.870 align:middle line:84%
And he went on
Saturday Night Live

00:16:55.870 --> 00:16:57.980 align:middle line:84%
to be a host-- a comedy
host, which he said,

00:16:57.980 --> 00:17:01.210 align:middle line:84%
hey, first off I'm Asperger
and I'm on the spectrum.

00:17:01.210 --> 00:17:05.742 align:middle line:84%
And then he said, look, I
just revived the electric car

00:17:05.742 --> 00:17:07.450 align:middle line:84%
industry and I'm
putting someone on Mars.

00:17:07.450 --> 00:17:10.210 align:middle line:84%
Did you think I was going to
be a normal balanced person?

00:17:10.210 --> 00:17:11.319 align:middle line:90%
Which I loved!

00:17:11.319 --> 00:17:14.079 align:middle line:84%
So what do you think is going
on with people like that

00:17:14.079 --> 00:17:17.470 align:middle line:84%
coming in and changing
industries overnight

00:17:17.470 --> 00:17:20.109 align:middle line:84%
through their sheer
genius and will,

00:17:20.109 --> 00:17:22.060 align:middle line:84%
and whatever they
do along the way?

00:17:22.060 --> 00:17:23.310 align:middle line:90%
Politically and business wise.

00:17:23.310 --> 00:17:24.110 align:middle line:90%
>> You know?

00:17:24.110 --> 00:17:28.349 align:middle line:84%
I think many people
have the opportunity

00:17:28.349 --> 00:17:32.130 align:middle line:84%
to pull that information
from the etheric.

00:17:32.130 --> 00:17:35.070 align:middle line:84%
Some people do it
unconsciously and naturally,

00:17:35.070 --> 00:17:39.420 align:middle line:84%
and Elon and Tom Petty, I
believe a lot of his writing--

00:17:39.420 --> 00:17:40.320 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah, that's true.

00:17:40.320 --> 00:17:41.000 align:middle line:90%
>> They pull this--

00:17:41.000 --> 00:17:41.700 align:middle line:90%
>> Creativity.

00:17:41.700 --> 00:17:42.500 align:middle line:90%
>> Creative energy.

00:17:42.500 --> 00:17:43.360 align:middle line:90%
>> Mm-hmm.

00:17:43.360 --> 00:17:48.870 align:middle line:84%
>> And I think that if people
had a practice of practicing

00:17:48.870 --> 00:17:50.208 align:middle line:90%
doing that, they would see--

00:17:50.208 --> 00:17:52.500 align:middle line:84%
>> We would be able to pull
more for ourselves as well.

00:17:52.500 --> 00:17:58.600 align:middle line:84%
>> For ourselves, and be able
to create whatever it is that we

00:17:58.600 --> 00:17:59.400 align:middle line:90%
want.

00:17:59.400 --> 00:18:02.790 align:middle line:84%
Maybe even have deeper
or higher understandings

00:18:02.790 --> 00:18:07.080 align:middle line:84%
of zero point energy or other
things, and I'm sure they know.

00:18:07.080 --> 00:18:08.447 align:middle line:90%
And yeah, all men are from Mars.

00:18:08.447 --> 00:18:09.247 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:18:09.247 --> 00:18:10.047 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHTER]

00:18:10.047 --> 00:18:11.147 align:middle line:90%
Oh, it's on Mars.

00:18:11.147 --> 00:18:13.230 align:middle line:84%
Well, I just wonder because
I've been watching him

00:18:13.230 --> 00:18:15.060 align:middle line:84%
through the years and
thought this isn't normal.

00:18:15.060 --> 00:18:16.440 align:middle line:84%
[LAUGHS] This man's
not normal, I'm

00:18:16.440 --> 00:18:18.357 align:middle line:84%
sure he wouldn't want
to be in a relationship.

00:18:18.357 --> 00:18:20.850 align:middle line:84%
But we appreciate
what he is doing.

00:18:20.850 --> 00:18:23.842 align:middle line:84%
>> There are a lot of people
on the planet right now who are

00:18:23.842 --> 00:18:25.050 align:middle line:90%
here because they want to be.

00:18:25.050 --> 00:18:25.560 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Mm-hmm.

00:18:25.560 --> 00:18:26.490 align:middle line:90%
>> Didn't need to be.

00:18:26.490 --> 00:18:26.940 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:18:26.940 --> 00:18:27.773 align:middle line:90%
>> But wanted to be.

00:18:27.773 --> 00:18:30.757 align:middle line:84%
>> Have a mission, and they're
working on it, and I mean,

00:18:30.757 --> 00:18:33.090 align:middle line:84%
I do happen to think he's one
of those he came here with

00:18:33.090 --> 00:18:35.215 align:middle line:84%
a purpose and you're not
going to knock him off it.

00:18:35.215 --> 00:18:36.150 align:middle line:90%
>> Right.

00:18:36.150 --> 00:18:37.608 align:middle line:84%
>> And whether he's
downloading it,

00:18:37.608 --> 00:18:39.810 align:middle line:84%
whether he's some other
thing or a hybrid himself,

00:18:39.810 --> 00:18:40.740 align:middle line:90%
who knows what he is.

00:18:40.740 --> 00:18:42.480 align:middle line:84%
But the point is,
this is being seeded

00:18:42.480 --> 00:18:45.720 align:middle line:84%
all over without permission
from the world's governments.

00:18:45.720 --> 00:18:48.670 align:middle line:84%
He's done this by himself,
and not by himself.

00:18:48.670 --> 00:18:49.470 align:middle line:90%
>> But yeah.

00:18:49.470 --> 00:18:52.440 align:middle line:84%
>> Under his own power,
and will, and creativity.

00:18:52.440 --> 00:18:56.678 align:middle line:84%
And the same thing with a lot
of these other technologies that

00:18:56.678 --> 00:18:58.470 align:middle line:84%
are starting to come
through, and it speaks

00:18:58.470 --> 00:18:59.680 align:middle line:90%
to what you said earlier--

00:18:59.680 --> 00:19:01.980 align:middle line:84%
who needs disclosure,
who needs the government

00:19:01.980 --> 00:19:04.110 align:middle line:90%
to stand up and say anything.

00:19:04.110 --> 00:19:07.900 align:middle line:84%
All of this is already
finding its way or not.

00:19:07.900 --> 00:19:10.740 align:middle line:84%
So this whole thing about the
governmental level of control

00:19:10.740 --> 00:19:15.270 align:middle line:84%
of information, suppressing
our potential as people,

00:19:15.270 --> 00:19:19.260 align:middle line:84%
as intergalactic people
and technologically

00:19:19.260 --> 00:19:21.690 align:middle line:90%
is just a fool's errand now.

00:19:21.690 --> 00:19:25.930 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, I mean, because
the mind can transcend space

00:19:25.930 --> 00:19:26.730 align:middle line:90%
and time.

00:19:26.730 --> 00:19:27.630 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Absolutely.

00:19:27.630 --> 00:19:31.930 align:middle line:84%
>> The mind can move into many
areas and come back with lots

00:19:31.930 --> 00:19:32.730 align:middle line:90%
of information.

00:19:32.730 --> 00:19:33.690 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Absolutely.

00:19:33.690 --> 00:19:35.982 align:middle line:84%
>> These are some of the
things that maybe we should be

00:19:35.982 --> 00:19:39.300 align:middle line:84%
teaching along with how
to control the mind.

00:19:39.300 --> 00:19:40.540 align:middle line:90%
Meditation.

00:19:40.540 --> 00:19:42.840 align:middle line:84%
And I think I shared
with you before

00:19:42.840 --> 00:19:46.950 align:middle line:84%
that I did spend a long time
in a Buddhist temple learning

00:19:46.950 --> 00:19:48.120 align:middle line:90%
how to meditate.

00:19:48.120 --> 00:19:48.920 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Mm-hmm.

00:19:48.920 --> 00:19:50.680 align:middle line:84%
>> I'd already been
doing it for 12 years.

00:19:50.680 --> 00:19:51.480 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:19:51.480 --> 00:19:56.260 align:middle line:84%
>> But I did learn more about
other worlds than anything

00:19:56.260 --> 00:19:57.060 align:middle line:90%
else.

00:19:57.060 --> 00:20:01.410 align:middle line:84%
And being able to utilize
our own natural resources

00:20:01.410 --> 00:20:03.420 align:middle line:84%
of our mind, that's
the big thing.

00:20:03.420 --> 00:20:05.540 align:middle line:84%
But everything right
now in our world is--

00:20:05.540 --> 00:20:06.915 align:middle line:84%
>> Taking us away
distracting us.

00:20:06.915 --> 00:20:07.715 align:middle line:90%
>> External.

00:20:07.715 --> 00:20:09.243 align:middle line:90%
Yeah, it's a total distraction.

00:20:09.243 --> 00:20:11.910 align:middle line:84%
>> That's the great gift, that's
the beauty of being human if we

00:20:11.910 --> 00:20:14.470 align:middle line:84%
chose to develop it
and utilize that.

00:20:14.470 --> 00:20:17.367 align:middle line:84%
So going on that
note now, OK, we're

00:20:17.367 --> 00:20:18.450 align:middle line:90%
hopscotching a little bit.

00:20:18.450 --> 00:20:20.850 align:middle line:84%
But on the notion
of using the mind

00:20:20.850 --> 00:20:22.940 align:middle line:84%
and discovering other
worlds and remembering,

00:20:22.940 --> 00:20:24.690 align:middle line:84%
you're doing something
kind of juicy right

00:20:24.690 --> 00:20:26.670 align:middle line:90%
now with NBC Universal.

00:20:26.670 --> 00:20:28.680 align:middle line:84%
And you're doing
a historical piece

00:20:28.680 --> 00:20:32.230 align:middle line:84%
and you're dealing with a
well-known musical star, Demi

00:20:32.230 --> 00:20:33.030 align:middle line:90%
Lovato.

00:20:33.030 --> 00:20:35.070 align:middle line:84%
And they called you
in to say, let's

00:20:35.070 --> 00:20:36.780 align:middle line:84%
see what's inside her
mind because she's

00:20:36.780 --> 00:20:41.470 align:middle line:84%
very curious, very interested in
the subject of contact in UFOs.

00:20:41.470 --> 00:20:42.270 align:middle line:90%
>> Mm-hmm.

00:20:42.270 --> 00:20:42.720 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right?

00:20:42.720 --> 00:20:43.050 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:20:43.050 --> 00:20:45.175 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: You tell us the
rest of the story, that's

00:20:45.175 --> 00:20:46.400 align:middle line:90%
all I know.

00:20:46.400 --> 00:20:48.120 align:middle line:84%
>> They had me
come and do my job.

00:20:48.120 --> 00:20:48.920 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:20:48.920 --> 00:20:49.720 align:middle line:90%
Regress.

00:20:49.720 --> 00:20:52.910 align:middle line:90%
>> To regress her, which I did.

00:20:52.910 --> 00:20:55.880 align:middle line:10%
But I've been doing a
lot more regressions

00:20:55.880 --> 00:20:58.760 align:middle line:10%
with the subject
hooked up to an EEG.

00:20:58.760 --> 00:21:02.720 align:middle line:84%
I think that when we can
watch the consciousness

00:21:02.720 --> 00:21:07.790 align:middle line:84%
slide from that beta brain wave
and move into the alpha brain

00:21:07.790 --> 00:21:10.560 align:middle line:84%
wave and hit that delta, and
even the theta brain wave,

00:21:10.560 --> 00:21:11.360 align:middle line:90%
and you see it.

00:21:11.360 --> 00:21:12.160 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Mm-hmm.

00:21:12.160 --> 00:21:13.890 align:middle line:90%
>> It goes into all of them.

00:21:13.890 --> 00:21:18.410 align:middle line:84%
I think it validates
for most people

00:21:18.410 --> 00:21:21.710 align:middle line:84%
that they're in the right
brain wave to retrieve.

00:21:21.710 --> 00:21:25.700 align:middle line:84%
In the subconscious
mind, you can't create.

00:21:25.700 --> 00:21:29.730 align:middle line:84%
The subconscious mind is like
a hard drive on a computer.

00:21:29.730 --> 00:21:32.120 align:middle line:84%
Now, unlike the
unconscious mind,

00:21:32.120 --> 00:21:37.010 align:middle line:84%
say, we're out drinking tequila
and [LAUGHS] shooting shots

00:21:37.010 --> 00:21:39.860 align:middle line:84%
and went too many
and you black out,

00:21:39.860 --> 00:21:42.350 align:middle line:84%
but you still go on for
three or four more hours.

00:21:42.350 --> 00:21:44.610 align:middle line:84%
Maybe karaoke or
something, who knows?

00:21:44.610 --> 00:21:45.410 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHS]

00:21:45.410 --> 00:21:47.330 align:middle line:84%
>> Yeah, you don't know
the next day for sure.

00:21:47.330 --> 00:21:48.330 align:middle line:90%
That's who doesn't know.

00:21:48.330 --> 00:21:50.460 align:middle line:84%
>> And you don't know,
and your memory is gone.

00:21:50.460 --> 00:21:51.260 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:21:51.260 --> 00:21:54.180 align:middle line:84%
>> And so who was
operating the body here?

00:21:54.180 --> 00:21:56.700 align:middle line:90%
And that's the unconscious mind.

00:21:56.700 --> 00:22:01.100 align:middle line:84%
So the unconscious mind, like
the observer energy inside,

00:22:01.100 --> 00:22:02.750 align:middle line:90%
takes over.

00:22:02.750 --> 00:22:05.810 align:middle line:84%
And the conscious
mind, just that 10%

00:22:05.810 --> 00:22:08.420 align:middle line:84%
of that beta brainwave,
is completely

00:22:08.420 --> 00:22:10.115 align:middle line:90%
suppressed so we have no memory.

00:22:10.115 --> 00:22:11.540 align:middle line:90%
>> Mm-hmm.

00:22:11.540 --> 00:22:13.410 align:middle line:84%
>> Is that memory still
in the subconscious?

00:22:13.410 --> 00:22:14.210 align:middle line:90%
Why it is?

00:22:14.210 --> 00:22:15.690 align:middle line:90%
Because we experienced it.

00:22:15.690 --> 00:22:17.760 align:middle line:84%
>> And so experience
is hardwired in there.

00:22:17.760 --> 00:22:19.350 align:middle line:84%
>> And so the
trick is accessing.

00:22:19.350 --> 00:22:20.150 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:22:20.150 --> 00:22:27.540 align:middle line:84%
>> And accessing is done
by using the right verbiage

00:22:27.540 --> 00:22:31.270 align:middle line:84%
to allow somebody to
move into that place.

00:22:31.270 --> 00:22:34.110 align:middle line:84%
>> So when you're using EEG,
it's just to really determine

00:22:34.110 --> 00:22:35.907 align:middle line:84%
what brain state
they've gone into.

00:22:35.907 --> 00:22:37.740 align:middle line:84%
And when you hit certain
ranges like, you're

00:22:37.740 --> 00:22:40.680 align:middle line:84%
talking about subconscious
ranges and these lower

00:22:40.680 --> 00:22:42.390 align:middle line:84%
slower frequency
ranges, it's almost

00:22:42.390 --> 00:22:44.200 align:middle line:90%
like a truth serum of sorts.

00:22:44.200 --> 00:22:45.000 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:22:45.000 --> 00:22:46.458 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: You can't
really lie to--

00:22:46.458 --> 00:22:49.330 align:middle line:90%
>> Well, it can't create a face.

00:22:49.330 --> 00:22:50.130 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Mm-hmm.

00:22:50.130 --> 00:22:51.310 align:middle line:90%
>> It can remember a face.

00:22:51.310 --> 00:22:52.110 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:22:52.110 --> 00:22:54.060 align:middle line:84%
>> But it won't--
like even in a dream.

00:22:54.060 --> 00:22:55.047 align:middle line:90%
>> Mm-hmm.

00:22:55.047 --> 00:22:57.630 align:middle line:84%
>> If you see a face in a dream,
it's because you've seen that

00:22:57.630 --> 00:22:58.245 align:middle line:90%
face before.

00:22:58.245 --> 00:22:59.045 align:middle line:90%
>> Mm-hmm.

00:22:59.045 --> 00:23:01.110 align:middle line:84%
>> There's no random
faces in a dream.

00:23:01.110 --> 00:23:01.910 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:23:01.910 --> 00:23:04.823 align:middle line:84%
>> Although, it doesn't mean
that the face was a being--

00:23:04.823 --> 00:23:06.865 align:middle line:84%
a sentient being, it could
have been from a book,

00:23:06.865 --> 00:23:08.010 align:middle line:90%
it might have been from a movie.

00:23:08.010 --> 00:23:08.340 align:middle line:90%
Mm-hmm.

00:23:08.340 --> 00:23:10.050 align:middle line:84%
>>MCDONALD: But we
cannot create that.

00:23:10.050 --> 00:23:11.580 align:middle line:84%
>> It's registered
there as memory.

00:23:11.580 --> 00:23:13.120 align:middle line:90%
>> Right, it's registered there.

00:23:13.120 --> 00:23:17.370 align:middle line:84%
And so it's very interesting
when we do hypnotize somebody

00:23:17.370 --> 00:23:20.910 align:middle line:84%
and get them into those lower
deeper levels of regression,

00:23:20.910 --> 00:23:24.990 align:middle line:84%
and they can easily
articulate their experience.

00:23:24.990 --> 00:23:31.100 align:middle line:84%
But also from a combined
energy perspective,

00:23:31.100 --> 00:23:33.680 align:middle line:84%
so that they can even
question the entity.

00:23:33.680 --> 00:23:34.480 align:middle line:90%
>> Mm-hmm.

00:23:34.480 --> 00:23:37.390 align:middle line:84%
>> Why did you pick
me at this time?

00:23:37.390 --> 00:23:41.070 align:middle line:84%
Or whatever it is, and get
their answer through them.

00:23:41.070 --> 00:23:42.480 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Mm-hmm.

00:23:42.480 --> 00:23:45.270 align:middle line:84%
>> And when we see that and
they're in the right brainwave,

00:23:45.270 --> 00:23:48.810 align:middle line:90%
I'm always very fascinated.

00:23:48.810 --> 00:23:52.640 align:middle line:84%
As a researcher, then I'm very
intrigued wanting specifics

00:23:52.640 --> 00:23:56.430 align:middle line:84%
to our systems, locations,
m-class planets.

00:23:56.430 --> 00:23:57.520 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:23:57.520 --> 00:23:59.610 align:middle line:84%
You are a serious
researcher, and you've also

00:23:59.610 --> 00:24:01.900 align:middle line:90%
done other high profile people.

00:24:01.900 --> 00:24:04.530 align:middle line:84%
So for in this
particular instance,

00:24:04.530 --> 00:24:10.050 align:middle line:84%
Demi has this deep fascination
with the subject of abduction,

00:24:10.050 --> 00:24:12.900 align:middle line:90%
disclosure, and so forth.

00:24:12.900 --> 00:24:14.880 align:middle line:84%
Can you share kind
of what she found out

00:24:14.880 --> 00:24:17.930 align:middle line:90%
about herself in this?

00:24:17.930 --> 00:24:19.340 align:middle line:90%
>> Ultimately.

00:24:19.340 --> 00:24:22.910 align:middle line:84%
Her experience
was very positive.

00:24:22.910 --> 00:24:26.720 align:middle line:84%
And I would say
that it would lean

00:24:26.720 --> 00:24:28.220 align:middle line:84%
towards a spiritual
enlightenment.

00:24:28.220 --> 00:24:29.660 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Mm-hmm.

00:24:29.660 --> 00:24:34.820 align:middle line:84%
>> With the help of
non-human entities.

00:24:34.820 --> 00:24:37.370 align:middle line:84%
>> That she had actually
had encounters with?

00:24:37.370 --> 00:24:38.690 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes, she did.

00:24:38.690 --> 00:24:40.745 align:middle line:90%
Three non-human entities.

00:24:40.745 --> 00:24:41.720 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Mm-hmm.

00:24:41.720 --> 00:24:43.710 align:middle line:84%
>> And funny how
they come in threes.

00:24:43.710 --> 00:24:44.510 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:24:44.510 --> 00:24:45.640 align:middle line:84%
>> Or maybe there's
safety in numbers.

00:24:45.640 --> 00:24:46.430 align:middle line:90%
>> Sacred number.

00:24:46.430 --> 00:24:46.880 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHTER]

00:24:46.880 --> 00:24:47.580 align:middle line:90%
>>MCDONALD: Right, that's true.

00:24:47.580 --> 00:24:48.497 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah, let's try it.

00:24:48.497 --> 00:24:53.120 align:middle line:84%
>> You know, so it's beautiful
actually to watch somebody

00:24:53.120 --> 00:24:56.790 align:middle line:90%
become enlightened.

00:24:56.790 --> 00:25:00.770 align:middle line:84%
And you can see it, it's like
this other layer of energy

00:25:00.770 --> 00:25:07.280 align:middle line:84%
somehow melts away in this
higher or truer vibration.

00:25:07.280 --> 00:25:12.140 align:middle line:84%
Sets in its place, and the
person is forever changed.

00:25:12.140 --> 00:25:15.230 align:middle line:84%
>> Yes, and Demi Lovato
makes the news all the time

00:25:15.230 --> 00:25:18.950 align:middle line:84%
because of this exploiter,
that, or the revelations of some

00:25:18.950 --> 00:25:21.170 align:middle line:84%
personal issues she's
had throughout time.

00:25:21.170 --> 00:25:24.170 align:middle line:84%
And having been with
her on this level,

00:25:24.170 --> 00:25:30.180 align:middle line:84%
how much of those kinds of
striving, trying to reach out,

00:25:30.180 --> 00:25:32.520 align:middle line:84%
trying to rebel, has
to do with the fact

00:25:32.520 --> 00:25:34.230 align:middle line:84%
that there was
something more in her

00:25:34.230 --> 00:25:37.280 align:middle line:84%
that she was trying
to remember and reach?

00:25:37.280 --> 00:25:41.150 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, I find that when
somebody experiences something

00:25:41.150 --> 00:25:45.200 align:middle line:84%
that they don't understand, and
then they question their own

00:25:45.200 --> 00:25:46.920 align:middle line:84%
self, not her in
particularly, but--

00:25:46.920 --> 00:25:47.795 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: In general.

00:25:47.795 --> 00:25:49.430 align:middle line:90%
>> --people in general.

00:25:49.430 --> 00:25:51.350 align:middle line:90%
They self-medicate.

00:25:51.350 --> 00:25:53.930 align:middle line:84%
There's a high percentage
of experiencers

00:25:53.930 --> 00:25:58.430 align:middle line:84%
doing drugs or alcohol to
self-medicate or to help

00:25:58.430 --> 00:25:59.390 align:middle line:90%
them sleep.

00:25:59.390 --> 00:26:03.050 align:middle line:84%
Many of them still have
a fear of going to sleep,

00:26:03.050 --> 00:26:04.310 align:middle line:90%
they're afraid of the dark.

00:26:04.310 --> 00:26:05.820 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Mm-hmm.

00:26:05.820 --> 00:26:06.730 align:middle line:90%
>> That's sad

00:26:06.730 --> 00:26:07.530 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:26:07.530 --> 00:26:10.230 align:middle line:84%
>> And so if we do
have disclosure,

00:26:10.230 --> 00:26:12.480 align:middle line:84%
I certainly have
something to say to them.

00:26:12.480 --> 00:26:14.790 align:middle line:90%
OK, I'm really not impressed.

00:26:14.790 --> 00:26:18.000 align:middle line:84%
I mean, the fundamental--
universal human rights

00:26:18.000 --> 00:26:23.520 align:middle line:84%
of a human being have to be
forefront, it can't be allowed.

00:26:23.520 --> 00:26:24.637 align:middle line:90%
>> Can't be imposed upon.

00:26:24.637 --> 00:26:26.970 align:middle line:84%
>> Can't have somebody come
in like a thief in the night

00:26:26.970 --> 00:26:29.280 align:middle line:84%
and taking people
and scaring them.

00:26:29.280 --> 00:26:30.180 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Mm-hmm.

00:26:30.180 --> 00:26:31.890 align:middle line:90%
>> We just can't allow it.

00:26:31.890 --> 00:26:34.590 align:middle line:84%
Now, it doesn't
need to be a threat.

00:26:34.590 --> 00:26:36.330 align:middle line:84%
Saying, you're not
allowed to do this.

00:26:36.330 --> 00:26:42.030 align:middle line:84%
It has to just be an agreement
through respect and love,

00:26:42.030 --> 00:26:45.690 align:middle line:84%
that if we're going to have
any exchange with anybody,

00:26:45.690 --> 00:26:48.000 align:middle line:90%
it has to be on that level.

00:26:48.000 --> 00:26:50.910 align:middle line:84%
And we're not the
best examples, we've

00:26:50.910 --> 00:26:53.810 align:middle line:90%
gone into indigenous tribes.

00:26:53.810 --> 00:26:54.630 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:26:54.630 --> 00:26:56.560 align:middle line:90%
We'll go into animal species.

00:26:56.560 --> 00:26:57.360 align:middle line:90%
Mhm?

00:26:57.360 --> 00:27:00.570 align:middle line:90%
No, we're no better than that.

00:27:00.570 --> 00:27:08.640 align:middle line:84%
>> No we're not, but we do learn
and we grow, and we can change.

00:27:08.640 --> 00:27:14.310 align:middle line:84%
Whereas, some of the
extraterrestrials locked

00:27:14.310 --> 00:27:17.110 align:middle line:90%
in a hive minded way of being.

00:27:17.110 --> 00:27:20.280 align:middle line:84%
So you got to understand, even
though, well, yes, everybody

00:27:20.280 --> 00:27:23.650 align:middle line:84%
is connected and
all of that is true.

00:27:23.650 --> 00:27:26.160 align:middle line:84%
We still think
individually, we maintain

00:27:26.160 --> 00:27:30.000 align:middle line:84%
our individual personality,
and they do not.

00:27:30.000 --> 00:27:33.690 align:middle line:84%
They're always constantly
connected in this hive mind,

00:27:33.690 --> 00:27:37.620 align:middle line:84%
so you can't overrule or
override and just say,

00:27:37.620 --> 00:27:39.840 align:middle line:84%
I don't want you
or I'm going to.

00:27:39.840 --> 00:27:41.170 align:middle line:90%
And that doesn't happen.

00:27:41.170 --> 00:27:44.070 align:middle line:84%
And so you're not going
to be able to see growth.

00:27:44.070 --> 00:27:45.260 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Mm-hmm.

00:27:45.260 --> 00:27:46.550 align:middle line:90%
>> Unless it's all at once.

00:27:46.550 --> 00:27:48.300 align:middle line:84%
>> Maybe you don't
have personal autonomy.

00:27:48.300 --> 00:27:49.910 align:middle line:90%
>> Right same as with us humans.

00:27:49.910 --> 00:27:53.520 align:middle line:84%
So I believe, it's every time
the population hits 10 billion,

00:27:53.520 --> 00:27:56.090 align:middle line:84%
And I think we're
at 7.6 currently.

00:27:56.090 --> 00:28:00.710 align:middle line:84%
That if we haven't shifted
into a bit of a higher

00:28:00.710 --> 00:28:02.840 align:middle line:84%
understanding, or
at least cleaned up

00:28:02.840 --> 00:28:05.272 align:middle line:84%
some of that emotional
baggage, we do reset.

00:28:05.272 --> 00:28:06.230 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Mm-hmm.

00:28:06.230 --> 00:28:11.030 align:middle line:84%
>> And so maybe I can't
remember what it was--

00:28:11.030 --> 00:28:14.070 align:middle line:84%
another five or seven years they
said we'll be hitting that 10

00:28:14.070 --> 00:28:15.560 align:middle line:90%
billion mark.

00:28:15.560 --> 00:28:20.930 align:middle line:84%
And so this is the time for
people to do their own work

00:28:20.930 --> 00:28:22.700 align:middle line:84%
and not be so
concerned about what

00:28:22.700 --> 00:28:23.930 align:middle line:90%
other people think of them.

00:28:23.930 --> 00:28:25.460 align:middle line:84%
Really, it's really
none of your business

00:28:25.460 --> 00:28:26.510 align:middle line:90%
what other people think of you.

00:28:26.510 --> 00:28:27.310 align:middle line:90%
>> Mm-hmm.

00:28:27.310 --> 00:28:29.840 align:middle line:84%
>> What's more important
is what you think of you,

00:28:29.840 --> 00:28:33.590 align:middle line:84%
and where you want to
go, what you want to do,

00:28:33.590 --> 00:28:38.210 align:middle line:84%
how you want to express
yourself, and ultimately,

00:28:38.210 --> 00:28:40.850 align:middle line:84%
leave your mark on the
world or your children.

00:28:40.850 --> 00:28:42.388 align:middle line:90%
>> Absolutely.

00:28:42.388 --> 00:28:44.430 align:middle line:84%
With that in mind, we're
going to talk about some

00:28:44.430 --> 00:28:45.430 align:middle line:90%
of that in a little bit.

00:28:45.430 --> 00:28:47.315 align:middle line:84%
I want to go back to
what we talked about--

00:28:47.315 --> 00:28:48.940 align:middle line:84%
started talking about
in the beginning,

00:28:48.940 --> 00:28:50.940 align:middle line:84%
and we kind of brought
it up a little with Demi.

00:28:50.940 --> 00:28:53.520 align:middle line:84%
But the nature of
the experiences

00:28:53.520 --> 00:28:56.250 align:middle line:84%
that people are having,
aren't the little grays

00:28:56.250 --> 00:28:58.500 align:middle line:84%
showing up so much you
told me off camera,

00:28:58.500 --> 00:29:02.730 align:middle line:84%
what is happening with the
people that come to you now?

00:29:02.730 --> 00:29:06.450 align:middle line:84%
>> So what's happening is they
don't feel that they're being

00:29:06.450 --> 00:29:10.360 align:middle line:84%
like levitated or
floated through a wall,

00:29:10.360 --> 00:29:13.080 align:middle line:84%
which many people have
had that experience.

00:29:13.080 --> 00:29:16.830 align:middle line:84%
And they wake up half of their
bodies still in their garage

00:29:16.830 --> 00:29:18.930 align:middle line:84%
while the other half is
entering the living room,

00:29:18.930 --> 00:29:20.200 align:middle line:90%
it's quite terrifying.

00:29:20.200 --> 00:29:21.000 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Mm-hmm.

00:29:21.000 --> 00:29:23.350 align:middle line:84%
>> And of course, it's
another physics question.

00:29:23.350 --> 00:29:24.150 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right

00:29:24.150 --> 00:29:25.410 align:middle line:84%
>>(CHUCKLING) I know
how they do that.

00:29:25.410 --> 00:29:26.670 align:middle line:90%
>> Time space too, yeah?

00:29:26.670 --> 00:29:27.640 align:middle line:90%
>> Time space.

00:29:27.640 --> 00:29:30.900 align:middle line:84%
But what's happening
is it's more

00:29:30.900 --> 00:29:34.680 align:middle line:84%
of a consciousness hijacking
where the consciousness is

00:29:34.680 --> 00:29:37.890 align:middle line:84%
separated from the
body, very much

00:29:37.890 --> 00:29:40.530 align:middle line:90%
like a out-of-body experience.

00:29:40.530 --> 00:29:43.260 align:middle line:90%
And that is taken someplace.

00:29:43.260 --> 00:29:48.570 align:middle line:84%
And tests like psychological
tests, fear-based tests,

00:29:48.570 --> 00:29:53.700 align:middle line:84%
and spiritual quandaries
are put to the person

00:29:53.700 --> 00:29:57.480 align:middle line:90%
to see how they will respond.

00:29:57.480 --> 00:30:01.770 align:middle line:84%
>> Can they tell who is doing
this on the other side with

00:30:01.770 --> 00:30:02.570 align:middle line:90%
them?

00:30:02.570 --> 00:30:07.920 align:middle line:84%
>> They see more of an energy
being, but almost always--

00:30:07.920 --> 00:30:09.390 align:middle line:90%
not almost always.

00:30:09.390 --> 00:30:14.290 align:middle line:84%
A lot of times are both
human and non-human beings--

00:30:14.290 --> 00:30:15.090 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: OK.

00:30:15.090 --> 00:30:15.930 align:middle line:90%
>> --are involved.

00:30:15.930 --> 00:30:16.730 align:middle line:90%
>> Collaborating.

00:30:16.730 --> 00:30:23.760 align:middle line:84%
>> And so imagine that you're
fully conscious of ourselves.

00:30:23.760 --> 00:30:27.220 align:middle line:84%
You know you're Regina,
but you have no body.

00:30:27.220 --> 00:30:28.020 align:middle line:90%
>> Mhm.

00:30:28.020 --> 00:30:32.830 align:middle line:84%
>> You're just like
this orb of light.

00:30:32.830 --> 00:30:38.170 align:middle line:84%
And then you're subjected
to specific stimuli

00:30:38.170 --> 00:30:41.590 align:middle line:84%
to see how you're going to
respond like for instance, one

00:30:41.590 --> 00:30:43.990 align:middle line:84%
person was put like
in a chair, they

00:30:43.990 --> 00:30:47.230 align:middle line:84%
explained like kind of how,
why you're getting executed.

00:30:47.230 --> 00:30:50.350 align:middle line:84%
And your arms are tied down,
and you're sitting in your legs,

00:30:50.350 --> 00:30:53.270 align:middle line:90%
or you're in a small room.

00:30:53.270 --> 00:30:55.370 align:middle line:84%
And there is a window
beside the door

00:30:55.370 --> 00:30:57.380 align:middle line:84%
that somebody was
viewing them from.

00:30:57.380 --> 00:31:00.920 align:middle line:84%
They open the door and
what the person experienced

00:31:00.920 --> 00:31:05.240 align:middle line:84%
was as if like 1,000
rats entered the room,

00:31:05.240 --> 00:31:06.560 align:middle line:90%
and they're tied down.

00:31:06.560 --> 00:31:11.090 align:middle line:84%
And with her mind, she
said she said it out loud,

00:31:11.090 --> 00:31:12.470 align:middle line:84%
but in her mind
at the same time,

00:31:12.470 --> 00:31:14.930 align:middle line:84%
she went, oh,
kitty, kitty, kitty!

00:31:14.930 --> 00:31:16.440 align:middle line:90%
And they all turned to kittens.

00:31:16.440 --> 00:31:17.240 align:middle line:90%
>> Mm-hmm.

00:31:17.240 --> 00:31:20.255 align:middle line:84%
>> And the person doing
the test was furious.

00:31:20.255 --> 00:31:22.441 align:middle line:90%


00:31:22.441 --> 00:31:23.608 align:middle line:90%
Maybe that's a little harsh.

00:31:23.608 --> 00:31:25.000 align:middle line:90%
>> Disappointed?

00:31:25.000 --> 00:31:27.960 align:middle line:84%
>> They didn't seem like
they wanted her to have that

00:31:27.960 --> 00:31:32.220 align:middle line:84%
ability, there were like three
people watching entities.

00:31:32.220 --> 00:31:34.740 align:middle line:84%
And two seemed OK, but
she said she really

00:31:34.740 --> 00:31:36.960 align:middle line:84%
focused in on the one
who didn't seem happy

00:31:36.960 --> 00:31:38.330 align:middle line:90%
that she could do that.

00:31:38.330 --> 00:31:40.060 align:middle line:90%
And so maybe.

00:31:40.060 --> 00:31:40.920 align:middle line:90%
>> Mm-hmm.

00:31:40.920 --> 00:31:42.870 align:middle line:84%
>> They don't want us
to be able to do that,

00:31:42.870 --> 00:31:47.850 align:middle line:84%
but that was her ability
to physically change.

00:31:47.850 --> 00:31:50.080 align:middle line:84%
I don't know, obviously,
they weren't real rats.

00:31:50.080 --> 00:31:50.880 align:middle line:90%
>> Mm-hmm.

00:31:50.880 --> 00:31:51.510 align:middle line:84%
>> And they couldn't
have been real kittens.

00:31:51.510 --> 00:31:53.040 align:middle line:84%
>> No, it was a
projection, right,

00:31:53.040 --> 00:31:54.330 align:middle line:90%
then she changed the scene.

00:31:54.330 --> 00:31:55.530 align:middle line:90%
>>MCDONALD: She overrode--

00:31:55.530 --> 00:31:56.330 align:middle line:90%
>>Right.

00:31:56.330 --> 00:31:57.960 align:middle line:90%
>> --their projection.

00:31:57.960 --> 00:32:01.440 align:middle line:84%
And so I think that it's
very important that we begin

00:32:01.440 --> 00:32:02.710 align:middle line:90%
to see what is a projection?

00:32:02.710 --> 00:32:03.510 align:middle line:90%
>> Mhm.

00:32:03.510 --> 00:32:04.500 align:middle line:90%
>> And what is it?

00:32:04.500 --> 00:32:07.470 align:middle line:84%
Maybe it's a UFO,
maybe it's a hologram!

00:32:07.470 --> 00:32:09.070 align:middle line:90%
How do we tell the difference?

00:32:09.070 --> 00:32:11.610 align:middle line:90%
>> Mm-hmm.

00:32:11.610 --> 00:32:13.890 align:middle line:84%
>> So they're playing with
people's consciousness,

00:32:13.890 --> 00:32:16.620 align:middle line:84%
which may even be having
unintended consequences

00:32:16.620 --> 00:32:19.200 align:middle line:84%
of helping people
understand the game better.

00:32:19.200 --> 00:32:25.500 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, it sure shows us
that we are capable of far,

00:32:25.500 --> 00:32:29.140 align:middle line:84%
far more than we've
ever been told.

00:32:29.140 --> 00:32:34.470 align:middle line:84%
And it shows us that we
have an opportunity now

00:32:34.470 --> 00:32:40.770 align:middle line:84%
to step into that in a
peaceful empowered state

00:32:40.770 --> 00:32:43.920 align:middle line:84%
and begin to create the
change that we want.

00:32:43.920 --> 00:32:47.760 align:middle line:84%
The whole phenomena, the
whole idea of communication

00:32:47.760 --> 00:32:51.210 align:middle line:84%
with non-humans, taking
our place galactically,

00:32:51.210 --> 00:32:53.430 align:middle line:84%
however you want to
look at it, it all

00:32:53.430 --> 00:32:57.090 align:middle line:90%
has to be done with reverence.

00:32:57.090 --> 00:32:57.960 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Mm-hmm.

00:32:57.960 --> 00:33:04.390 align:middle line:84%
>> With the right intent, not to
have power, not for technology.

00:33:04.390 --> 00:33:06.540 align:middle line:84%
And if it's about that,
then we don't want anything

00:33:06.540 --> 00:33:08.970 align:middle line:84%
to do with those
extraterrestrials.

00:33:08.970 --> 00:33:11.480 align:middle line:84%
Just because they come,
doesn't mean they can stay.

00:33:11.480 --> 00:33:15.660 align:middle line:84%
>> I know all that just because
they come with technology does

00:33:15.660 --> 00:33:17.730 align:middle line:84%
not mean they come with
higher consciousness.

00:33:17.730 --> 00:33:18.030 align:middle line:90%
>>MCDONALD: Absolutely!

00:33:18.030 --> 00:33:19.487 align:middle line:90%
>> This is always confused.

00:33:19.487 --> 00:33:20.820 align:middle line:90%
>> Right, and I'm not impressed.

00:33:20.820 --> 00:33:21.660 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:33:21.660 --> 00:33:23.270 align:middle line:84%
>> I'm sure one day,
we'll get there.

00:33:23.270 --> 00:33:23.620 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Mm-hmm.

00:33:23.620 --> 00:33:25.530 align:middle line:84%
>> And I'm really
not in a great hurry.

00:33:25.530 --> 00:33:29.820 align:middle line:84%
But come and show us
your antigravatic crafts,

00:33:29.820 --> 00:33:32.220 align:middle line:90%
and so forth-- great, OK?

00:33:32.220 --> 00:33:35.215 align:middle line:84%
But that doesn't mean that I'm
going to lay down and give you

00:33:35.215 --> 00:33:36.015 align:middle line:90%
my power.

00:33:36.015 --> 00:33:36.330 align:middle line:90%
>> Exactly.

00:33:36.330 --> 00:33:37.480 align:middle line:90%
>> And think, oh, save me.

00:33:37.480 --> 00:33:38.280 align:middle line:90%
>> Worship you.

00:33:38.280 --> 00:33:41.040 align:middle line:84%
>> Yeah, because nobody is
going to save ourselves.

00:33:41.040 --> 00:33:43.950 align:middle line:84%
And just for the record, the
original definition of the word

00:33:43.950 --> 00:33:46.540 align:middle line:90%
worship was work for.

00:33:46.540 --> 00:33:47.340 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Uh-huh.

00:33:47.340 --> 00:33:49.762 align:middle line:84%
>> And I think that that's
important to remember this

00:33:49.762 --> 00:33:49.920 align:middle line:90%
time.

00:33:49.920 --> 00:33:51.450 align:middle line:90%
>> That is good to remember.

00:33:51.450 --> 00:33:54.150 align:middle line:84%
>> I think that this is a
relevant time in history

00:33:54.150 --> 00:33:56.985 align:middle line:84%
to remember the original
definitions of a lot of word.

00:33:56.985 --> 00:33:58.470 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah, I think it is too.

00:33:58.470 --> 00:34:01.440 align:middle line:84%
And thank you, it's starting
to come up to the surface.

00:34:01.440 --> 00:34:04.420 align:middle line:84%
OK, so let's say this
UN event happens.

00:34:04.420 --> 00:34:05.220 align:middle line:90%
>> Mm-hmm.

00:34:05.220 --> 00:34:06.720 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Let's
say, it does happen.

00:34:06.720 --> 00:34:07.630 align:middle line:90%
>> Mm-hmm.

00:34:07.630 --> 00:34:09.090 align:middle line:90%
Went up.

00:34:09.090 --> 00:34:11.100 align:middle line:84%
>> Let's say it
happens in Brazil.

00:34:11.100 --> 00:34:16.889 align:middle line:84%
What could the highest
expression of that be?

00:34:16.889 --> 00:34:19.290 align:middle line:84%
How would you just
guess or expect

00:34:19.290 --> 00:34:22.320 align:middle line:84%
that humanity would respond
to this at this point?

00:34:22.320 --> 00:34:25.170 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, this meeting is
going to have to involve both

00:34:25.170 --> 00:34:27.780 align:middle line:90%
therapists and researchers.

00:34:27.780 --> 00:34:33.030 align:middle line:84%
So somebody has got to
make sure the power mongers

00:34:33.030 --> 00:34:35.370 align:middle line:90%
keep themselves in control.

00:34:35.370 --> 00:34:39.040 align:middle line:84%
Because ultimately, it
does come down to power.

00:34:39.040 --> 00:34:39.840 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Mm-hmm.

00:34:39.840 --> 00:34:42.330 align:middle line:90%
>> And/or the abuse of power.

00:34:42.330 --> 00:34:44.280 align:middle line:84%
And why do they need
that much power?

00:34:44.280 --> 00:34:45.389 align:middle line:90%
>> Mm-hmm.

00:34:45.389 --> 00:34:46.290 align:middle line:90%
Why?

00:34:46.290 --> 00:34:48.300 align:middle line:90%
>> Again, to control.

00:34:48.300 --> 00:34:50.969 align:middle line:84%
There's a lot of questions
that we have to look at.

00:34:50.969 --> 00:34:52.679 align:middle line:84%
the way our societies
are working.

00:34:52.679 --> 00:34:57.000 align:middle line:84%
And if we're going to have
these new changes happening

00:34:57.000 --> 00:35:00.090 align:middle line:84%
in this new millennium,
then we have

00:35:00.090 --> 00:35:01.590 align:middle line:84%
to have some form
of a guideline.

00:35:01.590 --> 00:35:03.880 align:middle line:84%
It can't be about money,
it can't be about power,

00:35:03.880 --> 00:35:05.520 align:middle line:90%
it can't be about technology.

00:35:05.520 --> 00:35:09.510 align:middle line:84%
It has to be about the higher
self, the understanding

00:35:09.510 --> 00:35:12.870 align:middle line:84%
and acceptance, the
embracing of the human.

00:35:12.870 --> 00:35:16.620 align:middle line:84%
The good, the bad, the ugly,
the complete indifferent.

00:35:16.620 --> 00:35:19.230 align:middle line:84%
By embracing it,
it's acceptance.

00:35:19.230 --> 00:35:22.080 align:middle line:84%
And you cannot change
what you cannot accept,

00:35:22.080 --> 00:35:23.860 align:middle line:90%
so you must accept it--

00:35:23.860 --> 00:35:24.660 align:middle line:90%
all of it.

00:35:24.660 --> 00:35:27.150 align:middle line:84%
And then create
the change that's

00:35:27.150 --> 00:35:33.630 align:middle line:84%
going to allow everybody to live
the way that we should happily.

00:35:33.630 --> 00:35:36.340 align:middle line:84%
Those 1,000 years
promised to us.

00:35:36.340 --> 00:35:37.140 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:35:37.140 --> 00:35:40.890 align:middle line:84%
>> They may be longer than that
if we know what we're doing.

00:35:40.890 --> 00:35:45.280 align:middle line:84%
And we can't be so
awestruck because awe--

00:35:45.280 --> 00:35:48.880 align:middle line:84%
it registers in the body
the same way as fear does.

00:35:48.880 --> 00:35:53.260 align:middle line:84%
It's like you've hit a road and
the conscious and subconscious

00:35:53.260 --> 00:35:55.300 align:middle line:84%
has no more information,
so you're either

00:35:55.300 --> 00:35:58.310 align:middle line:84%
awestruck because
something is so incredible,

00:35:58.310 --> 00:36:00.310 align:middle line:84%
or you're really fear
based because you've never

00:36:00.310 --> 00:36:01.820 align:middle line:90%
experienced anything like that.

00:36:01.820 --> 00:36:04.480 align:middle line:84%
But both of them come
from lack of experience.

00:36:04.480 --> 00:36:07.720 align:middle line:84%
And just because
something looks great,

00:36:07.720 --> 00:36:11.260 align:middle line:84%
there are physiological
and emotional ramifications

00:36:11.260 --> 00:36:14.260 align:middle line:84%
in our bodies that
we have to remember

00:36:14.260 --> 00:36:16.690 align:middle line:90%
or we're going to experience.

00:36:16.690 --> 00:36:21.610 align:middle line:84%
All of us, everyone is going
to register energetically

00:36:21.610 --> 00:36:22.880 align:middle line:90%
this change.

00:36:22.880 --> 00:36:27.690 align:middle line:84%
And so I think that it needs
to be done respectfully.

00:36:27.690 --> 00:36:28.860 align:middle line:90%
>> I agree with you.

00:36:28.860 --> 00:36:30.810 align:middle line:84%
Before we get into
that dovetails

00:36:30.810 --> 00:36:33.407 align:middle line:84%
in with a lot of what your
new work is, a couple of books

00:36:33.407 --> 00:36:34.240 align:middle line:90%
you have coming out.

00:36:34.240 --> 00:36:37.860 align:middle line:84%
But before we go there, let's
talk about a little trip

00:36:37.860 --> 00:36:40.980 align:middle line:84%
to India you'll be making when
you can get in the country.

00:36:40.980 --> 00:36:42.690 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:36:42.690 --> 00:36:45.000 align:middle line:84%
I'm hoping to do it
with the Travel Channel.

00:36:45.000 --> 00:36:48.570 align:middle line:84%
And we'll be
looking at an ashram

00:36:48.570 --> 00:36:51.510 align:middle line:84%
temple in the south of India
and the province of Kerala,

00:36:51.510 --> 00:36:53.730 align:middle line:84%
and forgive me if I don't
pronounce it correctly,

00:36:53.730 --> 00:36:55.860 align:middle line:90%
but kind of close to.

00:36:55.860 --> 00:36:58.920 align:middle line:84%
But they had discovered-- it's
been a couple of years now,

00:36:58.920 --> 00:37:03.030 align:middle line:84%
that upon opening one of the
chambers that had been blocked

00:37:03.030 --> 00:37:06.390 align:middle line:84%
off with all of these
like magical symbols

00:37:06.390 --> 00:37:07.860 align:middle line:84%
all around it
saying, don't do it!

00:37:07.860 --> 00:37:08.430 align:middle line:90%
>> Stay away.

00:37:08.430 --> 00:37:09.360 align:middle line:90%
>>MCDONALD: Stay away.

00:37:09.360 --> 00:37:09.560 align:middle line:90%
>> Poison.

00:37:09.560 --> 00:37:10.727 align:middle line:90%
>> And they went in any way.

00:37:10.727 --> 00:37:12.300 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHTER]

00:37:12.300 --> 00:37:13.950 align:middle line:90%
Skull and crossbones.

00:37:13.950 --> 00:37:17.010 align:middle line:84%
Well, you know us,
we'll speed ahead.

00:37:17.010 --> 00:37:20.580 align:middle line:84%
But we actually took almost
200 years to open this.

00:37:20.580 --> 00:37:24.090 align:middle line:84%
And upon opening it, they
say they found a UFO.

00:37:24.090 --> 00:37:26.940 align:middle line:84%
And I would like to have
a written permission--

00:37:26.940 --> 00:37:27.780 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:37:27.780 --> 00:37:31.770 align:middle line:84%
>> --to investigate it
and to find out exactly

00:37:31.770 --> 00:37:32.620 align:middle line:90%
what's happening.

00:37:32.620 --> 00:37:34.800 align:middle line:84%
I want to interview
the first people there,

00:37:34.800 --> 00:37:38.640 align:middle line:84%
I want to really
focus on the symbols.

00:37:38.640 --> 00:37:42.120 align:middle line:84%
They say they resemble
Sanskrit, but it's not.

00:37:42.120 --> 00:37:46.080 align:middle line:84%
So maybe it might resemble
an alien language,

00:37:46.080 --> 00:37:49.050 align:middle line:84%
and I do get quite a
bit of that come up.

00:37:49.050 --> 00:37:53.730 align:middle line:84%
In session, we see symbols
that people create pages

00:37:53.730 --> 00:37:55.780 align:middle line:90%
of them, this floods into them.

00:37:55.780 --> 00:37:56.580 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:37:56.580 --> 00:37:59.040 align:middle line:84%
And another one I've
done an interview with it

00:37:59.040 --> 00:38:01.140 align:middle line:90%
had a notebook with this and--

00:38:01.140 --> 00:38:01.940 align:middle line:90%
Jim Penniston?

00:38:01.940 --> 00:38:02.740 align:middle line:90%
Right?

00:38:02.740 --> 00:38:04.573 align:middle line:84%
Jim Penniston, the
Randlesham Forest affair?

00:38:04.573 --> 00:38:05.373 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:38:05.373 --> 00:38:06.810 align:middle line:84%
>> He too, has a
notebook of them.

00:38:06.810 --> 00:38:09.390 align:middle line:84%
Danny Sheehan even
went into that vault

00:38:09.390 --> 00:38:12.060 align:middle line:84%
and came out with the
symbols written down.

00:38:12.060 --> 00:38:14.420 align:middle line:84%
>> You should see
this is what I have.

00:38:14.420 --> 00:38:18.930 align:middle line:84%
Oh, and I take them from
different cases that I work in.

00:38:18.930 --> 00:38:21.540 align:middle line:84%
Compare them and look for
commonalities and similarities.

00:38:21.540 --> 00:38:22.260 align:middle line:90%
>> Are you seeing them?

00:38:22.260 --> 00:38:22.620 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah

00:38:22.620 --> 00:38:23.770 align:middle line:90%
>> Wonderful.

00:38:23.770 --> 00:38:28.590 align:middle line:84%
>> And of course, we have to
know that there's a certain

00:38:28.590 --> 00:38:33.720 align:middle line:84%
percentage of replication that
we're going to see spirals,

00:38:33.720 --> 00:38:35.890 align:middle line:84%
and so forth, and
stuff like that.

00:38:35.890 --> 00:38:37.680 align:middle line:90%
But yeah, there are.

00:38:37.680 --> 00:38:39.540 align:middle line:84%
>> I would ask you,
not just Sanskrit,

00:38:39.540 --> 00:38:43.650 align:middle line:84%
but how might some of those
symbols overlay with Egyptian

00:38:43.650 --> 00:38:44.860 align:middle line:90%
hieroglyphics for example?

00:38:44.860 --> 00:38:45.660 align:middle line:90%
>> Right.

00:38:45.660 --> 00:38:49.650 align:middle line:84%
What I'm seeing is in the
language of the subconscious

00:38:49.650 --> 00:38:50.833 align:middle line:90%
mind, isn't this--

00:38:50.833 --> 00:38:51.750 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Is symbolic.

00:38:51.750 --> 00:38:53.610 align:middle line:90%
>> Is symbolic, it's image.

00:38:53.610 --> 00:38:59.460 align:middle line:84%
And it is not words, it's
not a language like English,

00:38:59.460 --> 00:39:00.840 align:middle line:90%
or Chinese, or French.

00:39:00.840 --> 00:39:01.080 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:39:01.080 --> 00:39:01.935 align:middle line:90%
>> It's images.

00:39:01.935 --> 00:39:04.560 align:middle line:84%
>> It's going to be fascinating
once we get all these cataloged

00:39:04.560 --> 00:39:07.830 align:middle line:84%
into databases that can be
shared between researchers,

00:39:07.830 --> 00:39:12.750 align:middle line:84%
individuals with their body of
work, overlaying with Sanskrit,

00:39:12.750 --> 00:39:15.870 align:middle line:84%
with Egyptian symbolism,
Sumerian symbolism.

00:39:15.870 --> 00:39:18.270 align:middle line:84%
>> Some of them saying, it's
some type of angel language

00:39:18.270 --> 00:39:19.830 align:middle line:84%
or alien, but what's
the difference?

00:39:19.830 --> 00:39:21.580 align:middle line:84%
>> Yeah, I mean, It's
going to be amazing.

00:39:21.580 --> 00:39:24.940 align:middle line:84%
And that's in the near future,
to see this language start

00:39:24.940 --> 00:39:25.740 align:middle line:90%
to emerge.

00:39:25.740 --> 00:39:26.370 align:middle line:90%
I love it.

00:39:26.370 --> 00:39:27.170 align:middle line:90%
>> Right.

00:39:27.170 --> 00:39:30.400 align:middle line:84%
Well, we are going to
respond to these symbols.

00:39:30.400 --> 00:39:33.420 align:middle line:84%
They're going to mean
something very deep to us,

00:39:33.420 --> 00:39:35.695 align:middle line:84%
and they may propagate
internal change.

00:39:35.695 --> 00:39:36.495 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:39:36.495 --> 00:39:39.100 align:middle line:84%
>> Because that's what
hypnotherapy does when we use

00:39:39.100 --> 00:39:39.900 align:middle line:90%
the--

00:39:39.900 --> 00:39:40.530 align:middle line:90%
>> Absolutely.

00:39:40.530 --> 00:39:41.460 align:middle line:90%
>> --the symbols.

00:39:41.460 --> 00:39:42.630 align:middle line:90%
>> Absolutely.

00:39:42.630 --> 00:39:44.938 align:middle line:84%
OK, so on your work,
you already know what

00:39:44.938 --> 00:39:46.230 align:middle line:90%
you're doing with hypnotherapy.

00:39:46.230 --> 00:39:47.890 align:middle line:84%
You say, you've
started a new group?

00:39:47.890 --> 00:39:48.690 align:middle line:90%
>>MCDONALD: Yeah.

00:39:48.690 --> 00:39:50.370 align:middle line:90%
>> What does that mean?

00:39:50.370 --> 00:39:54.390 align:middle line:84%
>> I was running the Sacramento
Alien Abduction and Contactees

00:39:54.390 --> 00:39:59.100 align:middle line:84%
Support Group for a long time,
it was big and I stopped doing

00:39:59.100 --> 00:40:00.960 align:middle line:84%
that because I
didn't have the time.

00:40:00.960 --> 00:40:05.430 align:middle line:84%
And I've started a new one, we
haven't had our first meeting

00:40:05.430 --> 00:40:08.770 align:middle line:84%
yet primarily
because of location.

00:40:08.770 --> 00:40:11.580 align:middle line:84%
There's been restrictions in
the amount of people gathering

00:40:11.580 --> 00:40:12.390 align:middle line:90%
and so forth.

00:40:12.390 --> 00:40:13.980 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Which is
changing rapidly.

00:40:13.980 --> 00:40:14.220 align:middle line:90%
>> Right.

00:40:14.220 --> 00:40:15.000 align:middle line:90%
Well--

00:40:15.000 --> 00:40:15.480 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:40:15.480 --> 00:40:17.940 align:middle line:84%
>> It's recently occurred to me
that I'm just going to have it

00:40:17.940 --> 00:40:18.550 align:middle line:90%
outside.

00:40:18.550 --> 00:40:18.810 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:40:18.810 --> 00:40:19.770 align:middle line:90%
>> (CHUCKLING) Enough.

00:40:19.770 --> 00:40:20.700 align:middle line:90%
>> Good enough, OK.

00:40:20.700 --> 00:40:22.770 align:middle line:84%
So what are you doing
with this new group?

00:40:22.770 --> 00:40:24.840 align:middle line:84%
>> We're going to
have experiencers,

00:40:24.840 --> 00:40:27.000 align:middle line:84%
and we're going to talk
about how the effects

00:40:27.000 --> 00:40:28.500 align:middle line:90%
on consciousness.

00:40:28.500 --> 00:40:32.740 align:middle line:84%
And our first meeting is also
going to involve a skywatch.

00:40:32.740 --> 00:40:37.883 align:middle line:84%
So since there's been more UFOs
reported, it should be fun.

00:40:37.883 --> 00:40:39.925 align:middle line:84%
>> McKinley Park maybe,
I'll be there, I'll come.

00:40:39.925 --> 00:40:40.060 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHS]

00:40:40.060 --> 00:40:41.968 align:middle line:84%
>> Actually, I was
thinking Bannister Park.

00:40:41.968 --> 00:40:43.510 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Oh,
Bannister Park is good.

00:40:43.510 --> 00:40:46.750 align:middle line:84%
>> It's open-- a bigger open
area with less trees than

00:40:46.750 --> 00:40:49.570 align:middle line:84%
McKinley in a certain area for
viewing and I think it might

00:40:49.570 --> 00:40:49.628 align:middle line:90%
work.

00:40:49.628 --> 00:40:50.530 align:middle line:90%
>> It could be fun.

00:40:50.530 --> 00:40:51.340 align:middle line:90%
OK, good.

00:40:51.340 --> 00:40:53.440 align:middle line:84%
Well, that's good to know, and
you have written two books.

00:40:53.440 --> 00:40:54.240 align:middle line:90%
>>MCDONALD: Mm-hmm.

00:40:54.240 --> 00:40:56.380 align:middle line:84%
>> And those books
are coming out, right?

00:40:56.380 --> 00:40:59.290 align:middle line:84%
>> The extraterrestrial
interference has been a long

00:40:59.290 --> 00:41:00.580 align:middle line:90%
time in coming.

00:41:00.580 --> 00:41:04.090 align:middle line:84%
I've changed it so much
in the last five years

00:41:04.090 --> 00:41:08.355 align:middle line:84%
because I keep
finding deeper layers.

00:41:08.355 --> 00:41:10.730 align:middle line:84%
But you know, I've come to
the point where I got to stop.

00:41:10.730 --> 00:41:11.680 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: At some point.

00:41:11.680 --> 00:41:11.890 align:middle line:90%
[INTERPOSING VOICES]

00:41:11.890 --> 00:41:13.000 align:middle line:90%
Right at volume 2.

00:41:13.000 --> 00:41:14.050 align:middle line:90%
>> Right, volume 2.

00:41:14.050 --> 00:41:19.670 align:middle line:84%
And the second book is really
on the human experience.

00:41:19.670 --> 00:41:24.010 align:middle line:84%
It's on personal empowerment,
it's on self-actualization,

00:41:24.010 --> 00:41:27.380 align:middle line:84%
how to be the person that
you want to be in the world.

00:41:27.380 --> 00:41:30.790 align:middle line:84%
How you want to live, doing
the job that you want,

00:41:30.790 --> 00:41:33.670 align:middle line:84%
eating the food that you
want, all of those things

00:41:33.670 --> 00:41:36.040 align:middle line:84%
being completely
self-actualized.

00:41:36.040 --> 00:41:38.770 align:middle line:84%
And most people are
not self-actualized,

00:41:38.770 --> 00:41:41.680 align:middle line:84%
they're either
doing what they fell

00:41:41.680 --> 00:41:46.060 align:middle line:84%
into or they're doing what
makes them the most money.

00:41:46.060 --> 00:41:48.640 align:middle line:90%
That's always an issue.

00:41:48.640 --> 00:41:49.780 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:41:49.780 --> 00:41:54.220 align:middle line:84%
>> And so that true self
actualization generates deep

00:41:54.220 --> 00:41:58.630 align:middle line:84%
feelings of inner
tranquility and inner peace.

00:41:58.630 --> 00:42:01.930 align:middle line:84%
Where is that higher
level of self-acceptance,

00:42:01.930 --> 00:42:03.970 align:middle line:84%
where you're embracing
it, and that's

00:42:03.970 --> 00:42:06.500 align:middle line:84%
when the true change
begins to take place.

00:42:06.500 --> 00:42:12.440 align:middle line:84%
So I've laid out five steps
to personal empowerment

00:42:12.440 --> 00:42:13.610 align:middle line:90%
and inner peace.

00:42:13.610 --> 00:42:20.270 align:middle line:84%
And I think that anyone
who practices them or reads

00:42:20.270 --> 00:42:22.400 align:middle line:84%
them and has an
understanding, will

00:42:22.400 --> 00:42:26.750 align:middle line:84%
begin to see that there's
nothing we can't face,

00:42:26.750 --> 00:42:29.090 align:middle line:84%
there's nothing that
we can't change,

00:42:29.090 --> 00:42:31.310 align:middle line:84%
you know, people
have been victimized

00:42:31.310 --> 00:42:34.740 align:middle line:84%
and victim energy is
legitimate for a little while.

00:42:34.740 --> 00:42:35.540 align:middle line:90%
>> For a while.

00:42:35.540 --> 00:42:36.410 align:middle line:90%
>> OK?

00:42:36.410 --> 00:42:37.830 align:middle line:90%
Well, it's Legitimate?

00:42:37.830 --> 00:42:38.630 align:middle line:90%
Sure.

00:42:38.630 --> 00:42:41.540 align:middle line:84%
But we must survive
and all you've

00:42:41.540 --> 00:42:44.150 align:middle line:84%
got to do is not
die, that's not hard.

00:42:44.150 --> 00:42:46.730 align:middle line:90%
But it's the thriving, right?

00:42:46.730 --> 00:42:50.480 align:middle line:84%
Which means moving forward
and allowing the things

00:42:50.480 --> 00:42:53.660 align:middle line:84%
in the past to take
their appropriate place.

00:42:53.660 --> 00:42:55.940 align:middle line:84%
It's all about
learning, because as we

00:42:55.940 --> 00:42:59.690 align:middle line:84%
had talked about a bit
ago, it does come down

00:42:59.690 --> 00:43:03.890 align:middle line:84%
to there are only two
things to master as a human.

00:43:03.890 --> 00:43:06.380 align:middle line:90%
One is love and one is fear.

00:43:06.380 --> 00:43:11.180 align:middle line:84%
But on the planet of duality,
when those doors open,

00:43:11.180 --> 00:43:15.230 align:middle line:84%
you're either going to
be a great giver of love,

00:43:15.230 --> 00:43:17.900 align:middle line:84%
and maybe not such
a great receiver.

00:43:17.900 --> 00:43:21.530 align:middle line:84%
Receiver does require
that deeper vulnerability

00:43:21.530 --> 00:43:24.860 align:middle line:84%
to be more honest regardless
of what somebody else might

00:43:24.860 --> 00:43:26.880 align:middle line:90%
think it is what it is.

00:43:26.880 --> 00:43:29.810 align:middle line:84%
And then fear, you're
either a fear based because

00:43:29.810 --> 00:43:33.110 align:middle line:84%
of external stimuli, so
you're still worried too much

00:43:33.110 --> 00:43:36.560 align:middle line:84%
about outside stuff
or you're fear monger,

00:43:36.560 --> 00:43:38.420 align:middle line:84%
which you're really
pushing it because you

00:43:38.420 --> 00:43:41.130 align:middle line:90%
get some weird power from it.

00:43:41.130 --> 00:43:43.670 align:middle line:84%
And so being able
to understand fear--

00:43:43.670 --> 00:43:46.160 align:middle line:90%
real fear.

00:43:46.160 --> 00:43:49.710 align:middle line:84%
>> As it gets into the domain
of taking versus giving as well.

00:43:49.710 --> 00:43:50.510 align:middle line:90%
>>MCDONALD: Yeah!

00:43:50.510 --> 00:43:52.170 align:middle line:90%
>> Mm-hmm.

00:43:52.170 --> 00:43:56.550 align:middle line:10%
>> With fear, there's real
fear and there's imagined fear.

00:43:56.550 --> 00:43:57.350 align:middle line:10%
>>REGINA: Mm-hmm.

00:43:57.350 --> 00:43:59.750 align:middle line:10%
>> And you can say,
well, this might happen,

00:43:59.750 --> 00:44:02.370 align:middle line:10%
this could happen, this
has happened before,

00:44:02.370 --> 00:44:04.710 align:middle line:10%
but it's not
happening right now.

00:44:04.710 --> 00:44:08.990 align:middle line:10%
And if it's not happening
right now, it's not real fear.

00:44:08.990 --> 00:44:11.630 align:middle line:84%
And if it is happening,
then you ask yourself,

00:44:11.630 --> 00:44:14.060 align:middle line:90%
what is my next empowered step?

00:44:14.060 --> 00:44:16.820 align:middle line:84%
These are solar plexus
protocols when you're

00:44:16.820 --> 00:44:18.560 align:middle line:90%
working with the chakra system.

00:44:18.560 --> 00:44:21.140 align:middle line:84%
When you utilize
the solar plexus,

00:44:21.140 --> 00:44:23.540 align:middle line:90%
you can tap into that power.

00:44:23.540 --> 00:44:25.700 align:middle line:84%
And I really am
falling onto the side

00:44:25.700 --> 00:44:28.130 align:middle line:84%
that I believe the
solar plexus because it

00:44:28.130 --> 00:44:29.450 align:middle line:90%
works as an antenna--

00:44:29.450 --> 00:44:32.540 align:middle line:84%
those two clusters of
nerves reaching out.

00:44:32.540 --> 00:44:34.490 align:middle line:84%
And then the
information is processed

00:44:34.490 --> 00:44:36.260 align:middle line:84%
through the central
cortex of the brain.

00:44:36.260 --> 00:44:40.140 align:middle line:84%
I'm thinking that it
might be our first brain.

00:44:40.140 --> 00:44:42.690 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, they say the stomach
gets the information before

00:44:42.690 --> 00:44:43.490 align:middle line:90%
the brain.

00:44:43.490 --> 00:44:45.907 align:middle line:84%
So then there you go, I think
you might be onto something,

00:44:45.907 --> 00:44:46.800 align:middle line:90%
and you always are.

00:44:46.800 --> 00:44:47.970 align:middle line:90%
Thank you so much!

You're a busy, busy woman.

00:44:49.350 --> 00:44:52.752 align:middle line:84%
And I just I love the craziness
of the things you find yourself

00:44:52.752 --> 00:44:54.960 align:middle line:84%
involved in, people call
you from all over the world,

00:44:54.960 --> 00:44:55.660 align:middle line:90%
I love it.

00:44:55.660 --> 00:44:56.938 align:middle line:90%

This is fun, we'll do it again.
