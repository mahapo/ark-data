living cells in the human body

includes viruses, but mostly
bacteria and protozoa.

>>REGINA: And that's
hard for most people

00:01:03.720 --> 00:01:06.900 align:middle line:84%

that how can we look like this,

00:01:06.900 --> 00:01:09.660 align:middle line:84%

00:01:09.660 --> 00:01:10.460 align:middle line:90%

00:01:11.970 --> 00:01:15.210 align:middle line:10%
Well, in my mind,
we're taught to think

00:01:15.210 --> 00:01:19.410 align:middle line:10%
that we're the only important
ones on this earth, when we're

00:01:51.020 --> 00:01:52.500 align:middle line:84%

about microbes before,

00:01:56.190 --> 00:01:59.830 align:middle line:84%
and we kind of go deeper each
time into the conversation.

00:01:59.830 --> 00:02:01.290 align:middle line:84%
And we have a few
different areas

00:02:01.290 --> 00:02:04.330 align:middle line:84%
that I think most people are not
aware of we can get in today,

00:02:04.330 --> 00:02:09.720 align:middle line:84%
but first, let's talk about kind
of the synergistic relationship

00:02:09.720 --> 00:02:13.350 align:middle line:84%
between microbes
and the human cells

00:02:13.350 --> 00:02:14.940 align:middle line:84%
and how we keep our
health together.

00:02:14.940 --> 00:02:16.523 align:middle line:84%
But we're going to
go into something--

00:02:16.523 --> 00:02:19.170 align:middle line:84%
it's a word I've never heard
before actually until today--

00:02:19.170 --> 00:02:21.050 align:middle line:90%
called micro hormesis.

00:02:21.050 --> 00:02:21.850 align:middle line:90%

00:02:21.850 --> 00:02:24.240 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: OK, so
we'll end up there

00:02:24.240 --> 00:02:26.910 align:middle line:84%

else in the conversation.

00:02:26.910 --> 00:02:29.010 align:middle line:84%
So just launch in
and tell us how

00:02:29.010 --> 00:02:31.590 align:middle line:84%
this works, because
we are going to put

00:02:31.590 --> 00:02:33.780 align:middle line:84%
to bed a couple of
myths, and one of them

00:02:33.780 --> 00:02:37.300 align:middle line:84%
has to do with consumption of
Vitamin C in large amounts.

00:02:37.300 --> 00:02:38.100 align:middle line:90%
>>ROM: Right.

00:02:38.100 --> 00:02:40.080 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: So launch in.

00:02:40.080 --> 00:02:43.980 align:middle line:84%
>>ROM: Well, my
studies in microbes

00:02:43.980 --> 00:02:45.900 align:middle line:84%
has been going on for
about 20 years now.

00:02:45.900 --> 00:02:48.810 align:middle line:10%
In fact, 30 years since
I was in graduate school,

00:02:48.810 --> 00:02:52.230 align:middle line:10%
but I started picking
it up about 20 years ago

00:02:52.230 --> 00:02:54.840 align:middle line:10%
when the first studies
of what was then called

00:02:54.840 --> 00:02:57.360 align:middle line:10%
the human metabolome came out.

00:02:57.360 --> 00:03:02.190 align:middle line:84%
And the metabolome was all about
looking at the metabolites that

00:03:02.190 --> 00:03:03.960 align:middle line:90%
are produced in the urine.

00:03:03.960 --> 00:03:06.390 align:middle line:84%
And when they found out that
these metabolites were not

00:03:06.390 --> 00:03:08.010 align:middle line:84%
human in nature,
they were actually

00:03:08.010 --> 00:03:10.890 align:middle line:84%
coming from microbes
in their gut,

00:03:10.890 --> 00:03:13.020 align:middle line:84%
is when scientists
started to figure out

00:03:13.020 --> 00:03:16.410 align:middle line:84%
that the metabolites that
are created in the urine

00:03:16.410 --> 00:03:17.910 align:middle line:84%
are actually
created by microbes,

00:03:17.910 --> 00:03:20.280 align:middle line:90%
so let's call it the microbiome.

00:03:20.280 --> 00:03:22.500 align:middle line:84%
And they started
mapping out and seeing

00:03:22.500 --> 00:03:26.070 align:middle line:84%
the importance of all
the different microbes

00:03:26.070 --> 00:03:27.600 align:middle line:90%
in the human gut.

00:03:27.600 --> 00:03:30.150 align:middle line:84%
Because from these
metabolic studies,

00:03:30.150 --> 00:03:33.450 align:middle line:84%
and it was pioneered by Jeremy
Nicholson out of Cambridge

00:03:33.450 --> 00:03:37.980 align:middle line:84%
University, he found out that
just by looking at your pee,

00:03:37.980 --> 00:03:41.550 align:middle line:84%
he can find out where you live,
how long you're going to live,

00:03:41.550 --> 00:03:42.960 align:middle line:90%
and what you're eating.

00:03:42.960 --> 00:03:43.760 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:03:43.760 --> 00:03:44.560 align:middle line:90%
>>ROM: Right?

00:03:44.560 --> 00:03:47.250 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: I have a little book,
"What's My Pee Telling Me?"

00:03:47.250 --> 00:03:49.980 align:middle line:84%
and its companion book,
"What's Your Poo Telling You?"

00:03:49.980 --> 00:03:51.150 align:middle line:90%

00:03:51.150 --> 00:03:54.030 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: It goes into
some of this, yeah.

00:03:54.030 --> 00:03:57.390 align:middle line:84%
>>ROM: But our urine, it's
literally an ultra-filtrate

00:03:57.390 --> 00:03:58.860 align:middle line:90%
of what's going on in our body.

00:03:58.860 --> 00:04:01.290 align:middle line:84%
And a lot of people think,
yes, it's taking out

00:04:01.290 --> 00:04:04.320 align:middle line:84%
a lot of toxins, but the
things that we're building

00:04:04.320 --> 00:04:08.342 align:middle line:84%
inside our body in
response to what

00:04:08.342 --> 00:04:10.800 align:middle line:84%
the food that we're eating,
the different types of energies

00:04:10.800 --> 00:04:13.740 align:middle line:84%
that we're eating, our
bodies are responding

00:04:13.740 --> 00:04:16.110 align:middle line:90%
to these so-called stressors.

00:04:16.110 --> 00:04:18.269 align:middle line:84%
And this is where I
wanted to come in.

00:04:18.269 --> 00:04:20.670 align:middle line:84%
It's a concept called
micro hormesis.

00:04:20.670 --> 00:04:25.233 align:middle line:84%
So when we eat a
plant, the human cells

00:04:25.233 --> 00:04:26.400 align:middle line:90%
don't break down that plant.

00:04:26.400 --> 00:04:28.525 align:middle line:84%
It's actually the microbes
that actually break down

00:04:28.525 --> 00:04:30.210 align:middle line:90%
that plant matter.

00:04:30.210 --> 00:04:32.070 align:middle line:84%
And when that plant
matter happens

00:04:32.070 --> 00:04:39.030 align:middle line:84%
to be this natural biopesticide
that inhibits the bugs that

00:04:39.030 --> 00:04:42.480 align:middle line:84%
are eating that plant,
it's a small toxin

00:04:42.480 --> 00:04:45.210 align:middle line:84%
that appears in our
body, and the microbes

00:04:45.210 --> 00:04:48.990 align:middle line:84%
convert it into a way
that it tells our body

00:04:48.990 --> 00:04:51.060 align:middle line:90%
to become stronger.

00:04:51.060 --> 00:04:53.190 align:middle line:84%
It's a whole concept
called micro hormesis,

00:04:53.190 --> 00:04:56.130 align:middle line:84%
where we need our body
to build like a muscle.

00:04:56.130 --> 00:04:57.720 align:middle line:90%
Our immunity is like a muscle.

00:04:57.720 --> 00:04:59.417 align:middle line:90%
We need to build it.

00:04:59.417 --> 00:05:01.500 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Well, just like
when you're working out,

00:05:01.500 --> 00:05:03.042 align:middle line:84%
if you want to build
muscle, you have

00:05:03.042 --> 00:05:05.730 align:middle line:84%
to have the little micro
tears in the muscle so they

00:05:05.730 --> 00:05:09.300 align:middle line:84%
can stress and then repair and
become stronger and stronger.

00:05:09.300 --> 00:05:11.470 align:middle line:84%
Same thing you're saying
with our immune system

00:05:11.470 --> 00:05:14.770 align:middle line:84%
and with our cellular
functioning in general?

00:05:14.770 --> 00:05:15.570 align:middle line:90%
>>ROM: Yeah.

00:05:15.570 --> 00:05:19.620 align:middle line:84%
And you don't want to exercise
too much because then you'll

00:05:19.620 --> 00:05:21.030 align:middle line:90%
macro tear the muscles.

00:05:21.030 --> 00:05:22.150 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:05:22.150 --> 00:05:24.330 align:middle line:84%
>>ROM: So everything's
in balance.

00:05:24.330 --> 00:05:28.180 align:middle line:84%
And when you talk to people
that are longevity experts,

00:05:28.180 --> 00:05:31.710 align:middle line:84%
they are always talking about
holding everything in just

00:05:31.710 --> 00:05:33.060 align:middle line:90%
the right kind of balance.

00:05:33.060 --> 00:05:34.980 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And we tend
to think more is better.

00:05:34.980 --> 00:05:40.560 align:middle line:84%
I mean, that's really been a
big part of the self-help trend

00:05:40.560 --> 00:05:44.370 align:middle line:84%
in health over the last 30, 40
years is your doctors weren't

00:05:44.370 --> 00:05:46.500 align:middle line:84%
telling you what
nutrients you needed,

00:05:46.500 --> 00:05:48.420 align:middle line:84%
so you had to go
to other sources.

00:05:48.420 --> 00:05:51.960 align:middle line:84%
Some of them may have been MDs,
others nutritionists, others

00:05:51.960 --> 00:05:53.880 align:middle line:90%
just product developers.

00:05:53.880 --> 00:05:56.760 align:middle line:84%
And everyone says their product
is the one essential thing you

00:05:56.760 --> 00:05:59.520 align:middle line:84%
need, and we have
been so confused,

00:05:59.520 --> 00:06:04.080 align:middle line:84%
overwhelmed, even
unintentionally misled

00:06:04.080 --> 00:06:06.570 align:middle line:84%
to where we're overconsuming
all these things.

00:06:06.570 --> 00:06:09.270 align:middle line:84%
And to what extent
have we actually

00:06:09.270 --> 00:06:11.280 align:middle line:84%
started throwing
ourselves out of balance

00:06:11.280 --> 00:06:15.100 align:middle line:84%
trying to find this wonderful
state of homeostasis

00:06:15.100 --> 00:06:15.900 align:middle line:90%

>>ROM: Right.

00:06:16.320 --> 00:06:17.930 align:middle line:84%

00:06:19.190 --> 00:06:21.750 align:middle line:84%
First, going to the

00:06:21.750 --> 00:06:23.768 align:middle line:84%
the right
pharmaceutical medicine,

00:06:23.768 --> 00:06:26.060 align:middle line:84%
and now it's finding the
right nutritional supplements.

00:06:26.060 --> 00:06:27.060 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah, exactly.

00:06:27.060 --> 00:06:29.090 align:middle line:84%
>>ROM: Even me, I have
a whole basket case

00:06:29.090 --> 00:06:30.215 align:middle line:90%

00:06:30.215 --> 00:06:32.460 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Well, I think everyone

00:06:32.460 --> 00:06:33.370 align:middle line:90%
myself included.

00:06:33.370 --> 00:06:36.090 align:middle line:84%
And it's like,
yikes, the human body

00:06:36.090 --> 00:06:39.870 align:middle line:84%
used to be able to go on just
fine without all this stuff,

00:06:39.870 --> 00:06:42.660 align:middle line:90%
so what do we actually need?

00:06:42.660 --> 00:06:43.710 align:middle line:90%
>>ROM: Right.

00:06:43.710 --> 00:06:48.390 align:middle line:84%
So there is a new
field of science

00:06:48.390 --> 00:06:56.490 align:middle line:84%
that I'm calling the
bio-intelligent field science,

00:06:56.490 --> 00:07:01.140 align:middle line:84%
bio-intelligent field theory,
and it comes from the fact

00:07:01.140 --> 00:07:05.370 align:middle line:84%
that we need to think that
our body is a super organism

00:07:05.370 --> 00:07:07.980 align:middle line:84%
and that it's
self-directed and it's

00:07:07.980 --> 00:07:10.530 align:middle line:90%
got self-programming to heal.

00:07:10.530 --> 00:07:12.960 align:middle line:84%
Believe it or not, our
bodies are always healing.

00:07:12.960 --> 00:07:14.580 align:middle line:84%
No matter what
you try to do, you

00:07:14.580 --> 00:07:16.710 align:middle line:84%
can't stop your
body from healing.

00:07:16.710 --> 00:07:17.778 align:middle line:90%
But we don't seem to--

00:07:17.778 --> 00:07:19.320 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: That's
its prime directive.

00:07:19.320 --> 00:07:20.680 align:middle line:90%
>>ROM: Exactly, right?

00:07:20.680 --> 00:07:21.480 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:07:21.480 --> 00:07:23.188 align:middle line:84%
>>ROM: But it gets
these prime directives

00:07:23.188 --> 00:07:26.220 align:middle line:84%
from many different
forms of energy.

00:07:26.220 --> 00:07:28.980 align:middle line:84%
And people think that
the only way that we

00:07:28.980 --> 00:07:30.630 align:middle line:84%
get energy in our
body is through food,

00:07:30.630 --> 00:07:32.303 align:middle line:90%
and that's just simply not true.

00:07:32.303 --> 00:07:33.720 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: I mean,
really, Compton,

00:07:33.720 --> 00:07:35.178 align:middle line:84%
isn't the food,
the quality of food

00:07:35.178 --> 00:07:37.290 align:middle line:84%
we're eating now
more devitalizing

00:07:37.290 --> 00:07:38.850 align:middle line:90%
than healing for the most part?

00:07:38.850 --> 00:07:42.010 align:middle line:84%
>>ROM: It is, and it started
with the Green Revolution.

00:07:42.010 --> 00:07:42.810 align:middle line:90%
And the Green--

00:07:42.810 --> 00:07:43.980 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Talk about that.

00:07:43.980 --> 00:07:49.500 align:middle line:84%
>>ROM: Well, I wanted to talk
about how where we are now,

00:07:49.500 --> 00:07:51.290 align:middle line:84%
how we got to where
we are now isn't going

00:07:51.290 --> 00:07:53.550 align:middle line:90%
to get to where we want to go.

00:07:53.550 --> 00:07:54.570 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: OK, go ahead.

00:07:54.570 --> 00:07:56.403 align:middle line:84%
>>ROM: Like in a train
station, we literally

00:07:56.403 --> 00:08:00.760 align:middle line:84%
have to hop off this train
and get on a new train track.

00:08:00.760 --> 00:08:04.740 align:middle line:84%
And like a flight plan, if
you're flying from New York

00:08:04.740 --> 00:08:09.630 align:middle line:84%
to Los Angeles, if that
flight is off just by 1%,

00:08:09.630 --> 00:08:12.000 align:middle line:84%
you'll end up in the
ocean by the time

00:08:12.000 --> 00:08:13.780 align:middle line:90%
you get to Los Angeles.

00:08:13.780 --> 00:08:16.710 align:middle line:84%
But you don't know that
the flight is off by 1%.

00:08:16.710 --> 00:08:19.610 align:middle line:84%
So by thinking that, oh, this
food isn't going to hurt us,

00:08:19.610 --> 00:08:21.300 align:middle line:84%
and yeah, we put a
little pesticides

00:08:21.300 --> 00:08:25.530 align:middle line:84%
and we put herbicides in there,
it's not going to hurt us,

00:08:25.530 --> 00:08:28.600 align:middle line:84%
it doesn't hurt us in the short
term, but in the medium term,

00:08:28.600 --> 00:08:29.820 align:middle line:90%
we start to feel something.

00:08:29.820 --> 00:08:31.278 align:middle line:84%
And in the long
term, we definitely

00:08:31.278 --> 00:08:33.000 align:middle line:84%
know that there's
something missing.

00:08:33.000 --> 00:08:35.542 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So you said something
very intriguing a moment ago.

00:08:35.542 --> 00:08:37.950 align:middle line:84%
Where does the notion
of the Green Revolution

00:08:37.950 --> 00:08:39.299 align:middle line:90%
come into this?

00:08:39.299 --> 00:08:41.309 align:middle line:84%
>>ROM: The Green
Revolution started

00:08:41.309 --> 00:08:46.890 align:middle line:84%
during World War I, when German
scientists of a company that

00:08:46.890 --> 00:08:49.440 align:middle line:84%
is now known as
BASF figured out how

00:08:49.440 --> 00:08:53.730 align:middle line:84%
to make synthetic nitrogen to
put in bombs and in chemical

00:08:53.730 --> 00:08:55.470 align:middle line:90%
warfare.

00:08:55.470 --> 00:08:59.460 align:middle line:84%
And this nitrogen, instead
of harvesting nitrogen

00:08:59.460 --> 00:09:02.910 align:middle line:84%
from bat guano and whatnot
all over the world,

00:09:02.910 --> 00:09:09.690 align:middle line:84%
the British empire actually made
their money harvesting nitrogen

00:09:09.690 --> 00:09:12.820 align:middle line:84%
from natural caves
all around the world.

00:09:12.820 --> 00:09:16.650 align:middle line:84%
And when the Germans came in and
discovered how to make nitrogen

00:09:16.650 --> 00:09:21.190 align:middle line:84%
synthetically, they applied this
after World War I to the food.

00:09:21.190 --> 00:09:25.590 align:middle line:84%
And they said, oh, now
to support our burgeoning

00:09:25.590 --> 00:09:29.760 align:middle line:84%
population, we can create
this liquid form of nitrogen.

00:09:29.760 --> 00:09:32.760 align:middle line:84%
And so they applied the nitrogen
to the plants, and boom,

00:09:32.760 --> 00:09:34.750 align:middle line:84%
all these plants
started growing.

00:09:34.750 --> 00:09:38.190 align:middle line:84%
But what they didn't
realize is that just

00:09:38.190 --> 00:09:40.740 align:middle line:84%
by adding this excess
nitrogen, the plants

00:09:40.740 --> 00:09:43.590 align:middle line:84%
forgot how to make all
their other stuff that

00:09:43.590 --> 00:09:45.060 align:middle line:90%
keeps us alive and healthy.

00:09:45.060 --> 00:09:47.280 align:middle line:84%
Because they just
focused on growth, but

00:09:47.280 --> 00:09:48.840 align:middle line:90%
they didn't focus on nutrition.

00:09:48.840 --> 00:09:52.000 align:middle line:84%
And there's a difference
between growth and nutrition,

00:09:52.000 --> 00:09:55.350 align:middle line:84%
and that difference is in
the amount of information

00:09:55.350 --> 00:09:58.120 align:middle line:90%
that we're getting in our body.

00:09:58.120 --> 00:10:02.160 align:middle line:84%
So when we think
of nutrition, we

00:10:02.160 --> 00:10:06.045 align:middle line:84%
think of the energy
that's being created.

00:10:06.045 --> 00:10:09.270 align:middle line:84%
And when we look at food and
the food gets broken down

00:10:09.270 --> 00:10:12.480 align:middle line:84%
into its individual components
and the ultimate component

00:10:12.480 --> 00:10:16.390 align:middle line:84%
of all food, fats and
carbohydrates is glucose.

00:10:16.390 --> 00:10:19.940 align:middle line:84%
And when glucose gets broken
down, it gets broken down

00:10:19.940 --> 00:10:22.250 align:middle line:90%
and the mitochrondria seize it.

00:10:22.250 --> 00:10:25.750 align:middle line:84%
And ultimately, glucose is
just a form of electrons

00:10:25.750 --> 00:10:27.720 align:middle line:84%
and it's flowing,
and it gives us

00:10:27.720 --> 00:10:29.520 align:middle line:90%
the energy from which to move.

00:10:29.520 --> 00:10:33.330 align:middle line:84%
So when you look at the
energy that we're gaining,

00:10:33.330 --> 00:10:36.010 align:middle line:84%
you can look at the energy
as one of two things.

00:10:36.010 --> 00:10:40.320 align:middle line:84%
One is the energy as a flow
of electrons, and number two,

00:10:40.320 --> 00:10:44.130 align:middle line:84%
the energy has to have a
direction in which to go.

00:10:44.130 --> 00:10:47.070 align:middle line:84%
I mean, just imagine putting
gas in your car, which

00:10:47.070 --> 00:10:50.070 align:middle line:84%
is the electrons,
and then the GPS

00:10:50.070 --> 00:10:52.200 align:middle line:84%
doesn't tell you where to
go and you just go here

00:10:52.200 --> 00:10:53.190 align:middle line:90%
and you go there.

00:10:53.190 --> 00:10:55.020 align:middle line:84%
That's what's
happening to our food.

00:10:55.020 --> 00:10:57.750 align:middle line:84%
And worse yet, some of
the food that we take

00:10:57.750 --> 00:11:01.335 align:middle line:84%
are taking us over
a cliff, you know?

00:11:01.335 --> 00:11:02.875 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Which
foods in particular?

00:11:02.875 --> 00:11:04.500 align:middle line:84%
>>ROM: Well, I wouldn't
call it a food,

00:11:04.500 --> 00:11:07.940 align:middle line:84%
but look at
methamphetamine, right?

00:11:07.940 --> 00:11:09.750 align:middle line:84%
It has a lot of energy,
a lot of electrons.

00:11:09.750 --> 00:11:15.660 align:middle line:84%
And boom, you think that this
is like the biggest high,

00:11:15.660 --> 00:11:18.240 align:middle line:84%
it's the biggest thing that
you can feel in the world,

00:11:18.240 --> 00:11:21.630 align:middle line:84%
but it just leads you to
a road of destruction.

00:11:21.630 --> 00:11:25.020 align:middle line:84%
So that is a very
obvious thing that we

00:11:25.020 --> 00:11:28.335 align:middle line:84%
put in our body that's giving us
the wrong kind of information.

00:11:28.335 --> 00:11:29.460 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Methamphetamines?

00:11:29.460 --> 00:11:32.130 align:middle line:84%
But how is the average
person feeding themselves

00:11:32.130 --> 00:11:33.120 align:middle line:90%
methamphetamines?

00:11:33.120 --> 00:11:33.660 align:middle line:90%
>>ROM: They're not.

00:11:33.660 --> 00:11:34.160 align:middle line:90%
I'm just saying--

00:11:34.160 --> 00:11:35.190 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Oh,
you're saying just--

00:11:35.190 --> 00:11:36.500 align:middle line:90%
OK, and that's an extreme.

00:11:36.500 --> 00:11:37.583 align:middle line:90%
>>ROM: That's an extreme--

00:11:37.583 --> 00:11:41.220 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: What about in our
ordinary kind of menu of food?

00:11:41.220 --> 00:11:42.700 align:middle line:90%
>>ROM: Let's look at fast food.

00:11:42.700 --> 00:11:43.140 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: OK.

00:11:43.140 --> 00:11:43.940 align:middle line:90%
>>ROM: OK.

00:11:43.940 --> 00:11:46.500 align:middle line:84%
So when they created
a McDonald's burger,

00:11:46.500 --> 00:11:50.940 align:middle line:84%
there was a study
done in 2003 that

00:11:50.940 --> 00:11:54.480 align:middle line:84%
showed that the actual
microbes inside a burger

00:11:54.480 --> 00:11:56.190 align:middle line:84%
were kind of like
franken microbes.

00:11:56.190 --> 00:12:00.450 align:middle line:84%
They actually mutated to
accommodate the kind of meat

00:12:00.450 --> 00:12:03.870 align:middle line:84%
that was created full of
antibiotics, hormones,

00:12:03.870 --> 00:12:05.010 align:middle line:90%
pesticides, and chemicals.

00:12:05.010 --> 00:12:08.250 align:middle line:84%
Because in order to grow
the plants using the Green

00:12:08.250 --> 00:12:10.590 align:middle line:84%
Revolution in mono
crop status, you

00:12:10.590 --> 00:12:12.540 align:middle line:84%
had to use a lot of
pesticides and herbicides

00:12:12.540 --> 00:12:16.066 align:middle line:84%
because they weren't growing
this in heterogeneous ecology

00:12:16.066 --> 00:12:16.866 align:middle line:90%
anymore.

00:12:16.866 --> 00:12:18.610 align:middle line:90%
It was all mono crops.

00:12:18.610 --> 00:12:22.920 align:middle line:84%
So they would give the cows
things that they weren't

00:12:22.920 --> 00:12:24.300 align:middle line:90%
supposed to eat, which is corn.

00:12:24.300 --> 00:12:28.270 align:middle line:84%
I mean, cows are meant to eat
grass, but they gave them corn.

00:12:28.270 --> 00:12:30.570 align:middle line:84%
And so they started
fattening up on corn,

00:12:30.570 --> 00:12:33.430 align:middle line:84%
and they weren't fat enough, so
they gave them more hormones.

00:12:33.430 --> 00:12:37.020 align:middle line:84%
And they weren't healthy
enough, so they gave them

00:12:37.020 --> 00:12:39.040 align:middle line:90%
a lot of antibiotics.

00:12:39.040 --> 00:12:41.750 align:middle line:84%
So the meat that you are getting
were filled with hormones,

00:12:41.750 --> 00:12:43.167 align:middle line:84%
they were filled
with antibiotics,

00:12:43.167 --> 00:12:46.840 align:middle line:84%
and they were filled with
pesticides and herbicides.

00:12:46.840 --> 00:12:50.820 align:middle line:84%
And when you get this into
fast foods, into a burger,

00:12:50.820 --> 00:12:52.770 align:middle line:90%
your body would react to it.

00:12:52.770 --> 00:12:54.810 align:middle line:84%
And the way your
body reacts to it

00:12:54.810 --> 00:12:58.920 align:middle line:84%
is by killing off the microbes
that were healthy for you,

00:12:58.920 --> 00:13:01.860 align:middle line:84%
and then the microbes that
were actually feeding off

00:13:01.860 --> 00:13:03.390 align:middle line:90%
of that became mutant microbes.

00:13:03.390 --> 00:13:05.070 align:middle line:84%
And over time, you
see these movies

00:13:05.070 --> 00:13:09.070 align:middle line:84%
like "Supersize Me," the
guy gained 50 pounds.

00:13:09.070 --> 00:13:12.660 align:middle line:84%
He was almost in dire
need of emergency help.

00:13:12.660 --> 00:13:13.460 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: He was.

00:13:13.460 --> 00:13:16.500 align:middle line:84%
And it wasn't just that he'd
taken in too many calories.

00:13:16.500 --> 00:13:18.080 align:middle line:90%
What happened was exponential.

00:13:18.080 --> 00:13:21.510 align:middle line:84%
It was beyond just excessive
caloric consumption,

00:13:21.510 --> 00:13:22.830 align:middle line:90%
the level of his health.

00:13:22.830 --> 00:13:25.620 align:middle line:84%
You can take in excess
calories of healthy foods,

00:13:25.620 --> 00:13:27.593 align:middle line:84%
and you're not going
to end up like that.

00:13:27.593 --> 00:13:30.010 align:middle line:84%
>>ROM: Because the difference
is in the information that's

00:13:30.010 --> 00:13:31.920 align:middle line:90%
encoded in the food.

00:13:31.920 --> 00:13:33.480 align:middle line:84%
So every time we
take supplements,

00:13:33.480 --> 00:13:36.030 align:middle line:84%
every time we take food, we
need to think two things.

00:13:36.030 --> 00:13:38.940 align:middle line:84%
Does it have energy, and
does it have information?

00:13:38.940 --> 00:13:43.380 align:middle line:84%
The combination of the energy
of going plus the information

00:13:43.380 --> 00:13:46.650 align:middle line:84%
that it has is what I call
bio-intelligent nutrition.

00:13:46.650 --> 00:13:50.400 align:middle line:84%
This is the intelligence
that we're eating.

00:13:50.400 --> 00:13:55.590 align:middle line:84%
And what I'm proposing is that
in our system of governance,

00:13:55.590 --> 00:13:58.240 align:middle line:84%
in our system of governance
of how we make our food,

00:13:58.240 --> 00:14:00.510 align:middle line:84%
how we make our products,
how we make our houses,

00:14:00.510 --> 00:14:02.460 align:middle line:84%
we have the
opportunity to encode

00:14:02.460 --> 00:14:06.820 align:middle line:84%
bio-intelligent information
in every step of the process.

00:14:06.820 --> 00:14:12.270 align:middle line:84%
For example, if we take out
the intelligence of the food

00:14:12.270 --> 00:14:15.210 align:middle line:84%
by adding herbicides
and pesticides,

00:14:15.210 --> 00:14:17.790 align:middle line:84%
we disconnect from
nature, right?

00:14:17.790 --> 00:14:21.150 align:middle line:84%
Our food is actually being
dumbed down and disconnected

00:14:21.150 --> 00:14:24.108 align:middle line:84%
from nature right at
the point of growth.

00:14:24.108 --> 00:14:25.900 align:middle line:84%
Then we take it to the
processing facility,

00:14:25.900 --> 00:14:29.940 align:middle line:84%
and then we add other
things to the food.

00:14:29.940 --> 00:14:31.640 align:middle line:84%
To our skin products,
we add parabens.

00:14:31.640 --> 00:14:33.750 align:middle line:84%
To the food, we add
things that kill off

00:14:33.750 --> 00:14:36.120 align:middle line:84%
our microbiome because they
want to preserve the food.

00:14:36.120 --> 00:14:38.060 align:middle line:84%
But it's for the
convenience of who?

00:14:38.060 --> 00:14:38.860 align:middle line:90%
Us?

00:14:38.860 --> 00:14:40.985 align:middle line:84%
No, it's for the convenience
of the company selling

00:14:40.985 --> 00:14:44.950 align:middle line:84%
the food so they can leave it
in the shelves a lot longer.

00:14:44.950 --> 00:14:45.750 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:14:45.750 --> 00:14:46.550 align:middle line:90%
>>ROM: Right?

00:14:46.550 --> 00:14:50.010 align:middle line:84%
So instead of putting the
natural antibiotics in there,

00:14:50.010 --> 00:14:52.140 align:middle line:84%
the metabolites
made by microbes,

00:14:52.140 --> 00:14:54.300 align:middle line:84%
you're putting
chemicals in there.

00:14:54.300 --> 00:14:57.720 align:middle line:84%
And slowly over time,
that information

00:14:57.720 --> 00:15:02.610 align:middle line:84%
that tells the human being
how to live a longer life,

00:15:02.610 --> 00:15:06.610 align:middle line:84%
basically longevity
information, gets cut off.

00:15:06.610 --> 00:15:10.590 align:middle line:84%
And so the human being is
left to fend for itself on how

00:15:10.590 --> 00:15:13.890 align:middle line:84%
to react to this thing, and
it usually reacts negatively,

00:15:13.890 --> 00:15:17.090 align:middle line:84%
and it reacts negatively
usually by the first thing

00:15:17.090 --> 00:15:18.780 align:middle line:90%
is by weight gain.

00:15:18.780 --> 00:15:21.570 align:middle line:84%
You know that there's also
another study that came out

00:15:21.570 --> 00:15:26.340 align:middle line:84%
that people in the 1980s,
they did this study of people

00:15:26.340 --> 00:15:28.650 align:middle line:84%
in the 1980s that
ate the same thing

00:15:28.650 --> 00:15:31.530 align:middle line:84%
and exercised the
exact same way,

00:15:31.530 --> 00:15:35.220 align:middle line:84%
and they did a study
of people in 2010.

00:15:35.220 --> 00:15:37.620 align:middle line:84%
People in 2010, gained
an average of 20,

00:15:37.620 --> 00:15:40.552 align:middle line:84%
they were 20 pounds
heavier than what you

00:15:40.552 --> 00:15:41.760 align:middle line:90%
would have done in the 1980s.

00:15:41.760 --> 00:15:44.100 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Was it because of the
alteration of the food source,

00:15:44.100 --> 00:15:45.030 align:middle line:90%
that corruption--

00:15:45.030 --> 00:15:47.040 align:middle line:84%
>>ROM: Because of the
corruption of the food

00:15:47.040 --> 00:15:49.860 align:middle line:84%
source, the amount
of pharmaceuticals

00:15:49.860 --> 00:15:51.750 align:middle line:90%
that we are taking.

00:15:51.750 --> 00:15:53.310 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: What
about the notion--

00:15:53.310 --> 00:15:56.130 align:middle line:84%
because it is all just
information of all the EMFs

00:15:56.130 --> 00:15:57.090 align:middle line:90%
and so forth.

00:15:57.090 --> 00:16:00.165 align:middle line:90%
>>ROM: Yes, exactly.

00:16:00.165 --> 00:16:04.170 align:middle line:84%
This type of information
is very important.

00:16:04.170 --> 00:16:05.700 align:middle line:84%
There are healthy
EMFs, and there

00:16:05.700 --> 00:16:07.740 align:middle line:84%
are negative EMFs
that are important,

00:16:07.740 --> 00:16:11.400 align:middle line:84%
like the whole concept of pulse
electromagnetic frequencies now

00:16:11.400 --> 00:16:14.040 align:middle line:84%
and where they're pulsing
people with the right kind of--

00:16:14.040 --> 00:16:16.110 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: PEMF devices.

00:16:16.110 --> 00:16:17.190 align:middle line:90%
>>ROM: Yeah.

00:16:17.190 --> 00:16:20.160 align:middle line:84%
So I'm working
with a company now

00:16:20.160 --> 00:16:26.550 align:middle line:84%
that is trying to work
with me on putting PEMFs

00:16:26.550 --> 00:16:30.330 align:middle line:84%
in the microbes that we're
fermenting so that you can wear

00:16:30.330 --> 00:16:33.630 align:middle line:84%
a device that will activate the
actual probiotics in the foods

00:16:33.630 --> 00:16:35.490 align:middle line:90%
that we're creating.

00:16:35.490 --> 00:16:38.940 align:middle line:84%
So when I look at
creating our probiotics,

00:16:38.940 --> 00:16:42.570 align:middle line:84%
I look at basically five or six
different types of nutrition

00:16:42.570 --> 00:16:43.660 align:middle line:90%
that these microbes need.

00:16:43.660 --> 00:16:45.870 align:middle line:84%
And if the microbes
need these nutrition,

00:16:45.870 --> 00:16:47.650 align:middle line:90%
we need this kind of nutrition.

00:16:47.650 --> 00:16:48.450 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:16:48.450 --> 00:16:52.380 align:middle line:84%
>>ROM: They need nutrition
from food, number one,

00:16:52.380 --> 00:16:56.760 align:middle line:84%
but we also get nutrition
from light, right?

00:16:56.760 --> 00:16:58.920 align:middle line:84%
Believe it or not, infrared
light, when we get it,

00:16:58.920 --> 00:17:00.940 align:middle line:90%
fills us with electrons.

00:17:00.940 --> 00:17:04.970 align:middle line:10%
There's this renowned scientist
by name of Gerald Pollack,

00:17:04.970 --> 00:17:09.240 align:middle line:10%
and he has the concept called
"The Fourth Phase of Water,"

00:17:09.240 --> 00:17:11.940 align:middle line:10%
which is the water
inside of our cells

00:17:11.940 --> 00:17:14.710 align:middle line:10%
is completely different from
the water that we are drinking,

00:17:14.710 --> 00:17:17.579 align:middle line:10%
and that the water that we're
drinking, when it's combined

00:17:17.579 --> 00:17:19.770 align:middle line:10%
with infrared light,
the light changes

00:17:19.770 --> 00:17:23.790 align:middle line:10%
that water into a structured
water called hexagonal water.

00:17:23.790 --> 00:17:26.530 align:middle line:84%
It's a crystallized
form of water.

00:17:26.530 --> 00:17:28.830 align:middle line:90%
So water is three phases--

00:17:28.830 --> 00:17:33.120 align:middle line:90%
a gas, a liquid, and a solid.

00:17:33.120 --> 00:17:35.130 align:middle line:84%
But in the liquid
phase, there's actually

00:17:35.130 --> 00:17:38.130 align:middle line:84%
a solid phase called the
hexagonal crystal, which

00:17:38.130 --> 00:17:40.020 align:middle line:84%
he calls the fourth
phase of water,

00:17:40.020 --> 00:17:44.370 align:middle line:84%
and it gets converted when
we get infrared light.

00:17:44.370 --> 00:17:47.550 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: I know
a lot of devices

00:17:47.550 --> 00:17:51.780 align:middle line:84%
are on the market now featuring
infrared energy light,

00:17:51.780 --> 00:17:54.240 align:middle line:84%
but also there are some
that are combining near

00:17:54.240 --> 00:17:56.230 align:middle line:90%
and far red light together.

00:17:56.230 --> 00:17:57.030 align:middle line:90%
What is that?

00:17:57.030 --> 00:18:00.000 align:middle line:84%
What does the near light
do as opposed to the far?

00:18:00.000 --> 00:18:02.250 align:middle line:84%
>>ROM: Well, the
near light doesn't

00:18:02.250 --> 00:18:05.550 align:middle line:84%
penetrate as far as
the far infrared light,

00:18:05.550 --> 00:18:08.580 align:middle line:90%
but they're both good.

00:18:08.580 --> 00:18:10.590 align:middle line:84%
I mean, far infrared
light penetrates a lot

00:18:10.590 --> 00:18:13.260 align:middle line:84%
deeper into tissues
and the cells,

00:18:13.260 --> 00:18:17.280 align:middle line:84%
but we need a lot more research
on the type of information

00:18:17.280 --> 00:18:18.210 align:middle line:90%
that's going in there.

00:18:18.210 --> 00:18:21.260 align:middle line:90%


00:18:21.260 --> 00:18:23.940 align:middle line:84%
I don't care to
use war analogies,

00:18:23.940 --> 00:18:26.730 align:middle line:84%
but it's the difference
between sending

00:18:26.730 --> 00:18:29.370 align:middle line:84%
in light that's
equivalent to raw army

00:18:29.370 --> 00:18:32.760 align:middle line:84%
recruits versus sending
in light that's educated

00:18:32.760 --> 00:18:35.520 align:middle line:84%
and that's kind of like
special forces, right?

00:18:35.520 --> 00:18:38.190 align:middle line:84%
So you need less light
if that light is actually

00:18:38.190 --> 00:18:41.790 align:middle line:84%
encoded with information that
gives our body the blueprint

00:18:41.790 --> 00:18:43.090 align:middle line:90%
to live longer.

00:18:43.090 --> 00:18:47.610 align:middle line:84%
So the kind of information that
I'm talking about could be--

00:18:47.610 --> 00:18:49.050 align:middle line:84%
there's two kinds
of information.

00:18:49.050 --> 00:18:51.120 align:middle line:84%
When you go to
homeopathics and you

00:18:51.120 --> 00:18:52.920 align:middle line:84%
go to pharmaceutical
medicines, they're

00:18:52.920 --> 00:18:56.760 align:middle line:84%
usually information on how
to go against something, how

00:18:56.760 --> 00:18:57.570 align:middle line:90%
to stomp down.

00:18:57.570 --> 00:19:00.660 align:middle line:84%
Like you got this symptom,
OK, let's stomp it down.

00:19:00.660 --> 00:19:03.410 align:middle line:84%
You got this thing, let's put
a homeopathic antidote to it.

00:19:03.410 --> 00:19:04.410 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA MEREDITH: Yeah.

00:19:04.410 --> 00:19:06.750 align:middle line:84%
>>ROM: But back in the
1700s and the 1800s

00:19:06.750 --> 00:19:09.720 align:middle line:84%
when homeopathy
started, there weren't

00:19:09.720 --> 00:19:11.928 align:middle line:84%
that many chronic
diseases, so they

00:19:11.928 --> 00:19:13.470 align:middle line:84%
were able to stomp
down this and they

00:19:13.470 --> 00:19:14.678 align:middle line:90%
were able to stomp down that.

00:19:14.678 --> 00:19:17.100 align:middle line:84%
But now there's so many
things to stomp down,

00:19:17.100 --> 00:19:19.260 align:middle line:90%
we can't control it.

00:19:19.260 --> 00:19:21.930 align:middle line:84%
The field of bio-intelligent
field medicine,

00:19:21.930 --> 00:19:24.810 align:middle line:84%
bio-intelligent
field science, means

00:19:24.810 --> 00:19:28.230 align:middle line:84%
that if you can provide a
blueprint, because the body is

00:19:28.230 --> 00:19:30.840 align:middle line:84%
self-directed, if you can
provide the optimal blueprint

00:19:30.840 --> 00:19:33.680 align:middle line:84%
for that body to optimize
itself and you give it

00:19:33.680 --> 00:19:35.340 align:middle line:84%
that information
to optimize itself,

00:19:35.340 --> 00:19:38.050 align:middle line:84%
you don't have to worry
about the different symptoms.

00:19:38.050 --> 00:19:40.260 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So how
does one determine

00:19:40.260 --> 00:19:42.150 align:middle line:90%
what the optimal blueprint is?

00:19:42.150 --> 00:19:44.760 align:middle line:84%
>>ROM: Oh, that's
a good question.

00:19:44.760 --> 00:19:49.410 align:middle line:84%
The way we're doing it is
by looking at urine studies.

00:19:49.410 --> 00:19:52.350 align:middle line:84%
So number one, the
optimal blueprint

00:19:52.350 --> 00:19:54.240 align:middle line:90%
is always coming in nature.

00:19:54.240 --> 00:19:57.550 align:middle line:90%


00:19:57.550 --> 00:20:04.510 align:middle line:84%
What I tend to feel is that we
can do a better job in science.

00:20:04.510 --> 00:20:07.760 align:middle line:84%
Our doctors, our scientists,
they're all brilliant,

00:20:07.760 --> 00:20:11.290 align:middle line:84%
but we can do a
better job thinking

00:20:11.290 --> 00:20:15.160 align:middle line:84%
that we're here because of
nature as opposed to we're

00:20:15.160 --> 00:20:17.620 align:middle line:90%
here against nature.

00:20:17.620 --> 00:20:22.030 align:middle line:84%
We're two sides of
the same coin, right?

00:20:22.030 --> 00:20:26.140 align:middle line:84%
We can't experience light unless
we've experienced darkness.

00:20:26.140 --> 00:20:29.980 align:middle line:84%
We can't experience love
until we've actually

00:20:29.980 --> 00:20:31.720 align:middle line:90%
experienced pain.

00:20:31.720 --> 00:20:36.430 align:middle line:84%
And so for us to
experience living and not

00:20:36.430 --> 00:20:40.270 align:middle line:84%
say that we're not here because
of the things that got us here

00:20:40.270 --> 00:20:45.700 align:middle line:84%
is completely wrong thinking,
and the types of information

00:20:45.700 --> 00:20:50.245 align:middle line:84%
that nature is giving us
we're totally blocking out.

00:20:50.245 --> 00:20:52.370 align:middle line:84%
And the earth has been here
for four billion years,

00:20:52.370 --> 00:20:55.510 align:middle line:84%
the universe has been here
for who knows how long,

00:20:55.510 --> 00:20:58.440 align:middle line:84%
and we're betting
against it, right?

00:20:58.440 --> 00:21:01.270 align:middle line:84%
If I was going to Vegas,
I would never ever

00:21:01.270 --> 00:21:02.650 align:middle line:90%
bet against the house.

00:21:02.650 --> 00:21:03.840 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: No.

00:21:03.840 --> 00:21:06.360 align:middle line:90%
Nature is going to do OK.

00:21:06.360 --> 00:21:09.062 align:middle line:84%
It's whether this species
and others are going to--

00:21:09.062 --> 00:21:10.270 align:middle line:90%
>>ROM: So why bet against it?

00:21:10.270 --> 00:21:11.070 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:21:11.070 --> 00:21:14.710 align:middle line:84%
>>ROM: So find the
optimal intelligence

00:21:14.710 --> 00:21:16.630 align:middle line:84%
that nature is giving
us, encode that

00:21:16.630 --> 00:21:19.180 align:middle line:84%
in every step of the process
that we're making food,

00:21:19.180 --> 00:21:23.450 align:middle line:84%
that we're making supplements,
that we're making our products,

00:21:23.450 --> 00:21:25.690 align:middle line:84%
and the way we encode it is
by making sure that we've

00:21:25.690 --> 00:21:27.580 align:middle line:90%
got a connection to nature.

00:21:27.580 --> 00:21:30.490 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: OK, so you
started by saying that urine

00:21:30.490 --> 00:21:31.910 align:middle line:90%
is where you're starting.

00:21:31.910 --> 00:21:35.680 align:middle line:84%
So when we're talking about
individually tailoring

00:21:35.680 --> 00:21:39.700 align:middle line:84%
what stressors and what
sustenance our bodies,

00:21:39.700 --> 00:21:42.000 align:middle line:84%
our microbes and
cells are calling for,

00:21:42.000 --> 00:21:42.910 align:middle line:90%
how does that work?

00:21:42.910 --> 00:21:44.350 align:middle line:84%
What's that whole
chain look like?

00:21:44.350 --> 00:21:47.560 align:middle line:84%
>>ROM: OK, so our
urine is basically

00:21:47.560 --> 00:21:50.500 align:middle line:84%
our body's way of telling us
what's happening in our body

00:21:50.500 --> 00:21:51.760 align:middle line:90%
dynamically.

00:21:51.760 --> 00:21:55.180 align:middle line:84%
We can take our blood,
we can take our saliva,

00:21:55.180 --> 00:21:57.490 align:middle line:84%
but for me, there's a
lot of studies being

00:21:57.490 --> 00:21:58.900 align:middle line:90%
done on urine metabolites.

00:21:58.900 --> 00:22:01.540 align:middle line:84%
For example, let's
just take inflammation.

00:22:01.540 --> 00:22:03.200 align:middle line:84%
So there are these
urine metabolites--

00:22:03.200 --> 00:22:06.580 align:middle line:84%
C-reactive protein, NF
Kappa Beta protein--

00:22:06.580 --> 00:22:09.880 align:middle line:84%
and a lot of these
stressors that come out

00:22:09.880 --> 00:22:12.010 align:middle line:84%
when our inflammation
is really high,

00:22:12.010 --> 00:22:15.170 align:middle line:84%
it shows up immediately
in our urine.

00:22:15.170 --> 00:22:19.120 align:middle line:84%
So if you take something
and that C-reactive protein

00:22:19.120 --> 00:22:22.510 align:middle line:84%
goes down, you know
that what you're taking

00:22:22.510 --> 00:22:25.570 align:middle line:90%
has bio-intelligent information.

00:22:25.570 --> 00:22:29.980 align:middle line:84%
So for example, do you know that
there's a urine metabolite that

00:22:29.980 --> 00:22:33.970 align:middle line:84%
can determine whether or
not what you're taking

00:22:33.970 --> 00:22:35.700 align:middle line:90%
is effective in PTSD?

00:22:35.700 --> 00:22:36.500 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: No.

00:22:36.500 --> 00:22:37.450 align:middle line:90%
>>ROM: Yeah.

00:22:37.450 --> 00:22:42.240 align:middle line:84%
So this urine metabolite, one
of them is called cortisol.

00:22:42.240 --> 00:22:47.020 align:middle line:84%
And a lot of people know it,
but it's basically an effector

00:22:47.020 --> 00:22:48.220 align:middle line:90%
of our adrenal glands.

00:22:48.220 --> 00:22:50.890 align:middle line:84%
And every time we're
stressed-- people with PTSD

00:22:50.890 --> 00:22:54.500 align:middle line:84%
have high amounts of cortisol
always in their blood.

00:22:54.500 --> 00:22:58.210 align:middle line:84%
So you do therapies,
you do meditation,

00:22:58.210 --> 00:23:00.010 align:middle line:90%
that cortisol level goes down.

00:23:00.010 --> 00:23:05.810 align:middle line:84%
So the meditation itself,
which is usually sound therapy,

00:23:05.810 --> 00:23:09.190 align:middle line:84%
contains information
that's allowing the body

00:23:09.190 --> 00:23:12.430 align:middle line:84%
to lower its cortisol
levels, right?

00:23:12.430 --> 00:23:14.860 align:middle line:84%
So that's bio-intelligent
information.

00:23:14.860 --> 00:23:17.380 align:middle line:84%
So you have to work backwards,
kind of like a detective,

00:23:17.380 --> 00:23:21.700 align:middle line:84%
to say, what are these
metabolites in the urine?

00:23:21.700 --> 00:23:24.250 align:middle line:84%
And what are the ones that
are affecting our glucose

00:23:24.250 --> 00:23:25.930 align:middle line:90%
metabolism?

00:23:25.930 --> 00:23:29.200 align:middle line:84%
What are the ones affecting
our immunity status?

00:23:29.200 --> 00:23:31.813 align:middle line:84%
What are the ones affecting
our inflammation status?

00:23:31.813 --> 00:23:33.730 align:middle line:84%
What are the ones that
are affecting our heart

00:23:33.730 --> 00:23:34.990 align:middle line:90%
cardiovascular status?

00:23:34.990 --> 00:23:39.910 align:middle line:84%
And then you find that you've
got microbial metabolites

00:23:39.910 --> 00:23:42.070 align:middle line:84%
lowering these things,
you've got plant metabolites

00:23:42.070 --> 00:23:45.400 align:middle line:84%
lowering these things,
you've got electrical pulses

00:23:45.400 --> 00:23:47.610 align:middle line:84%
lowering these things,
you've got magnetic pulses

00:23:47.610 --> 00:23:49.960 align:middle line:90%
lowering these things, right?

00:23:49.960 --> 00:23:52.570 align:middle line:84%
And when they lower
things, you start

00:23:52.570 --> 00:23:56.470 align:middle line:84%
to point the body towards
an optimal direction.

00:23:56.470 --> 00:24:00.790 align:middle line:84%
So instead of figuring out
what the body has to tamp down,

00:24:00.790 --> 00:24:04.280 align:middle line:84%
let's keep focused on how
the body needs to go forward.

00:24:04.280 --> 00:24:07.690 align:middle line:84%
And anything going forward
means it's optimal wellness,

00:24:07.690 --> 00:24:10.340 align:middle line:84%
and to me, it's always
about longevity.

00:24:10.340 --> 00:24:14.170 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So would you say that
en masse in Western culture

00:24:14.170 --> 00:24:18.970 align:middle line:84%
that we have sort of a
mass chronic inflammation?

00:24:18.970 --> 00:24:20.020 align:middle line:90%
>>ROM: Absolutely.

00:24:20.020 --> 00:24:23.020 align:middle line:84%
Inflammation is like
the number one thing

00:24:23.020 --> 00:24:26.050 align:middle line:84%
that's preventing us from
achieving optimal wellness

00:24:26.050 --> 00:24:27.370 align:middle line:90%
and longevity.

00:24:27.370 --> 00:24:32.320 align:middle line:84%
And the better we can tamp
down that inflammation,

00:24:32.320 --> 00:24:35.200 align:middle line:84%
the longer we're going to
live because inflammation

00:24:35.200 --> 00:24:36.390 align:middle line:90%
affects everything.

00:24:36.390 --> 00:24:39.840 align:middle line:84%
Inflammation in our
cardiovascular system

00:24:39.840 --> 00:24:41.920 align:middle line:90%
occludes the arteries.

00:24:41.920 --> 00:24:45.100 align:middle line:84%
Inflammation in
our immune system

00:24:45.100 --> 00:24:47.590 align:middle line:84%
is always triggering
our immune system.

00:24:47.590 --> 00:24:48.990 align:middle line:90%
It's everything and everywhere.

00:24:48.990 --> 00:24:51.580 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: OK, so now this
will get more complex

00:24:51.580 --> 00:24:55.540 align:middle line:84%
because each body is just, in
terms of its own information

00:24:55.540 --> 00:24:58.270 align:middle line:84%
system, so different,
but there have

00:24:58.270 --> 00:25:01.280 align:middle line:84%
to be some common points
between human beings.

00:25:01.280 --> 00:25:05.140 align:middle line:84%
So for example, you
have people, say,

00:25:05.140 --> 00:25:07.510 align:middle line:84%
if they're faced
with cancer, you

00:25:07.510 --> 00:25:10.690 align:middle line:84%
have people going on a vegan
diet to take care of cancer,

00:25:10.690 --> 00:25:13.420 align:middle line:84%
you have people going on
a bone broth diet, a Keto

00:25:13.420 --> 00:25:15.910 align:middle line:90%
diet, and all-juice diet.

00:25:15.910 --> 00:25:18.940 align:middle line:84%
Everyone's approaching it
from every different angle,

00:25:18.940 --> 00:25:24.760 align:middle line:84%
the same issue, and for a
good percentage of people,

00:25:24.760 --> 00:25:28.210 align:middle line:84%
that particular
one really works.

00:25:28.210 --> 00:25:32.590 align:middle line:84%
How do you deal with
internal inflammation?

00:25:32.590 --> 00:25:35.420 align:middle line:84%
How do we deal with this
inflammation in our bodies

00:25:35.420 --> 00:25:36.220 align:middle line:90%
en masse?

00:25:36.220 --> 00:25:39.683 align:middle line:84%
How do you know which
path to take for you?

00:25:39.683 --> 00:25:41.350 align:middle line:84%
Because this is the
most confusing thing

00:25:41.350 --> 00:25:44.470 align:middle line:84%
people are going through,
information overwhelm.

00:25:44.470 --> 00:25:46.470 align:middle line:84%
Oh, you have to do
Keto to make this work.

00:25:46.470 --> 00:25:48.570 align:middle line:84%
No, you have to be
vegan to make it work.

00:25:48.570 --> 00:25:49.840 align:middle line:84%
>>ROM: And how do you
know it's working?

00:25:49.840 --> 00:25:51.160 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: How do you
know it's working?

00:25:51.160 --> 00:25:53.030 align:middle line:84%
And how do you know
what's right for you?

00:25:53.030 --> 00:25:55.020 align:middle line:84%
>>ROM: So how do you
know anything is working?

00:25:55.020 --> 00:25:56.770 align:middle line:84%
How do you know anything
is right for you?

00:25:56.770 --> 00:25:58.420 align:middle line:84%
You know what they
call it in medicine?

00:25:58.420 --> 00:26:02.590 align:middle line:84%
It's called outcomes, and
managing your outcomes

00:26:02.590 --> 00:26:06.620 align:middle line:84%
is the key to all medication
and all pharmaceuticals.

00:26:06.620 --> 00:26:09.760 align:middle line:84%
So they look at these outcomes,
and usually these outcomes

00:26:09.760 --> 00:26:15.430 align:middle line:84%
are, in terms of inflammation,
what is your C-reactive protein

00:26:15.430 --> 00:26:18.320 align:middle line:84%
looking like and what
is your blood level

00:26:18.320 --> 00:26:20.980 align:middle line:84%
of these inflammation
markers looking like?

00:26:20.980 --> 00:26:24.700 align:middle line:84%
And in physiology, what
is your range of motion?

00:26:24.700 --> 00:26:30.220 align:middle line:84%
And in mental cognitive tests,
are you thinking better?

00:26:30.220 --> 00:26:33.080 align:middle line:84%
Those are markers for
lower inflammation.

00:26:33.080 --> 00:26:34.810 align:middle line:84%
And then you find
out what's causing

00:26:34.810 --> 00:26:37.300 align:middle line:90%
that lowering of inflammation.

00:26:37.300 --> 00:26:40.750 align:middle line:84%
And usually, if it's
something that's

00:26:40.750 --> 00:26:43.330 align:middle line:84%
actually specific
for inflammation,

00:26:43.330 --> 00:26:45.190 align:middle line:90%
it's going against inflammation.

00:26:45.190 --> 00:26:47.770 align:middle line:84%
But if you look at
something that's

00:26:47.770 --> 00:26:50.440 align:middle line:84%
allowing your body to
deal with inflammation

00:26:50.440 --> 00:26:54.392 align:middle line:84%
and using that
inflammation as a stressor,

00:26:54.392 --> 00:26:57.708 align:middle line:84%
it's what's called an optimal
blueprint inflammation.

00:26:57.708 --> 00:27:00.250 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: But how do you find
out what that thing is for you?

00:27:00.250 --> 00:27:01.780 align:middle line:84%
>>ROM: You would have
to test your urine,

00:27:01.780 --> 00:27:03.030 align:middle line:90%
you'd have to test your blood.

00:27:03.030 --> 00:27:06.220 align:middle line:84%
So what we're not doing
is, because we're not

00:27:06.220 --> 00:27:08.740 align:middle line:84%
getting paid for it by
a medical insurance,

00:27:08.740 --> 00:27:12.220 align:middle line:84%
we have to do urine tests,
urine metabolic testing

00:27:12.220 --> 00:27:13.720 align:middle line:90%
of our own types.

00:27:13.720 --> 00:27:16.660 align:middle line:84%
And this is something that we're
starting at Ascended Health,

00:27:16.660 --> 00:27:22.390 align:middle line:84%
to start a really affordable
testing panel down the road.

00:27:22.390 --> 00:27:24.880 align:middle line:84%
I mean, I've already
partnered with a testing lab

00:27:24.880 --> 00:27:27.990 align:middle line:84%
to figure out these
tests for inflammation,

00:27:27.990 --> 00:27:32.410 align:middle line:84%
for immunity, where you can
just actually send in your urine

00:27:32.410 --> 00:27:35.180 align:middle line:84%
and do a really
cheap test for it.

00:27:35.180 --> 00:27:38.980 align:middle line:84%
And then soon we'll have
dipsticks and things like that.

00:27:38.980 --> 00:27:42.298 align:middle line:84%
But metrics are the number
one way to figure out.

00:27:42.298 --> 00:27:43.590 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah, it makes sense.

00:27:43.590 --> 00:27:47.350 align:middle line:84%
>>ROM: Even different
vendors selling vitamin Cs,

00:27:47.350 --> 00:27:50.530 align:middle line:84%
you might be more
predicated to taking

00:27:50.530 --> 00:27:53.758 align:middle line:84%
one vitamin C versus
another vendor's vitamin C.

00:27:53.758 --> 00:27:55.300 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: I mean,
because we're going

00:27:55.300 --> 00:27:57.020 align:middle line:84%
to get into vitamin
C in a moment,

00:27:57.020 --> 00:27:58.780 align:middle line:84%
so we have many
different kinds, right?

00:27:58.780 --> 00:28:00.322 align:middle line:90%
>>ROM: Yeah.

00:28:00.322 --> 00:28:01.780 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And, I
mean, whether it's

00:28:01.780 --> 00:28:06.310 align:middle line:84%
powdered calcium
ascorbate, Lypo-Spheric, I

00:28:06.310 --> 00:28:08.530 align:middle line:84%
mean, there are so many
different forms of vitamin C

00:28:08.530 --> 00:28:09.850 align:middle line:90%
available now.

00:28:09.850 --> 00:28:12.490 align:middle line:84%
And again, how do you
know which one is working

00:28:12.490 --> 00:28:13.940 align:middle line:90%
for you versus against you?

00:28:13.940 --> 00:28:17.170 align:middle line:84%
So let's talk about
vitamin C because that's

00:28:17.170 --> 00:28:19.970 align:middle line:84%
so ubiquitous in so
many people's diets.

00:28:19.970 --> 00:28:20.770 align:middle line:90%
>>ROM: Exactly.

00:28:20.770 --> 00:28:25.210 align:middle line:84%
So the only way we know is just
by our own innate feel, right?

00:28:25.210 --> 00:28:26.830 align:middle line:84%
But if we're really
going to know,

00:28:26.830 --> 00:28:32.140 align:middle line:84%
we have to take a quantitative
test on whether or not

00:28:32.140 --> 00:28:34.840 align:middle line:84%
that vitamin C is
actually lowering

00:28:34.840 --> 00:28:40.640 align:middle line:84%
your ROS, your Reactive
Oxygen Species, in your body.

00:28:40.640 --> 00:28:43.420 align:middle line:84%
So you can test for
reactive oxygen species,

00:28:43.420 --> 00:28:46.540 align:middle line:84%
and when you take
vitamin C, how does it

00:28:46.540 --> 00:28:49.390 align:middle line:84%
test for when you take your
urine five minutes, an hour,

00:28:49.390 --> 00:28:52.390 align:middle line:90%
and two hours after you take it?

00:28:52.390 --> 00:28:54.880 align:middle line:84%
I mean, it's expensive,
but that's really

00:28:54.880 --> 00:28:57.790 align:middle line:84%
the only way we
can do it, until we

00:28:57.790 --> 00:29:01.420 align:middle line:84%
come up with the technology
that can actually

00:29:01.420 --> 00:29:04.360 align:middle line:84%
have a marker in our
toilet and we just--

00:29:07.350 --> 00:29:08.892 align:middle line:84%

he said that's
coming in 50 years,

00:29:10.640 --> 00:29:13.360 align:middle line:84%
so maybe another 5,
10, 15, 20 years.

00:29:13.360 --> 00:29:15.820 align:middle line:84%
>>ROM: It's probably coming
in the next couple years.

00:29:15.820 --> 00:29:16.200 align:middle line:90%

a great technology.

00:29:18.910 --> 00:29:20.780 align:middle line:84%
Just explain for people
who aren't aware of it

00:29:20.780 --> 00:29:21.580 align:middle line:90%
what this means.

00:29:21.580 --> 00:29:25.252 align:middle line:84%
I mean, it's really
pretty profound.

00:29:25.252 --> 00:29:26.710 align:middle line:10%
>>ROM: It's a
technology that we're

00:29:26.710 --> 00:29:32.080 align:middle line:10%
working on in my new company
called Longevican called

00:29:32.080 --> 00:29:35.230 align:middle line:10%
optimized bio-habitats,
or bio-tats, where you can

00:29:35.230 --> 00:29:40.150 align:middle line:10%
come in and live in a space
where that space is actively

00:29:40.150 --> 00:29:42.940 align:middle line:10%
going to dynamically
measure every single thing

00:29:42.940 --> 00:29:44.050 align:middle line:10%
of your body.

00:29:44.050 --> 00:29:47.380 align:middle line:84%
Your urine and your stool will
have sensors inside the urine

00:29:47.380 --> 00:29:51.343 align:middle line:84%
and stool, and that'll be
uploaded via USB port to say,

00:29:51.343 --> 00:29:53.260 align:middle line:84%
OK, these are the
metabolites that's going in.

00:29:53.260 --> 00:29:55.180 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: The information
is coming from your toilet?

00:29:55.180 --> 00:29:56.680 align:middle line:84%
>>ROM: It's coming
from your toilet,

00:29:56.680 --> 00:29:58.560 align:middle line:90%
but is going into the cloud.

00:29:58.560 --> 00:30:04.800 align:middle line:84%
It's being analyzed by AI,
saying that, OK, so now you're

00:30:04.800 --> 00:30:07.280 align:middle line:84%
optimized, we have to get
your information levels low.

00:30:07.280 --> 00:30:09.030 align:middle line:84%
And then you're going
to be able to see it

00:30:09.030 --> 00:30:11.930 align:middle line:84%
in your app to see what your
inflammation levels are.

00:30:11.930 --> 00:30:17.750 align:middle line:84%
But if you're trying to get
into ketoacidosis, for example,

00:30:17.750 --> 00:30:19.470 align:middle line:84%
so a lot of people
want to lose weight

00:30:19.470 --> 00:30:22.620 align:middle line:84%
and they're going
on this Keto diet,

00:30:22.620 --> 00:30:26.260 align:middle line:84%
well, you can measure the
ketoacidosis in your breath.

00:30:26.260 --> 00:30:28.970 align:middle line:84%
So we'll have sensors
in the ceilings

00:30:28.970 --> 00:30:31.280 align:middle line:84%
to measure your
oxygen utilization,

00:30:31.280 --> 00:30:35.318 align:middle line:84%
but also measure the
acetone levels in the air.

00:30:35.318 --> 00:30:36.860 align:middle line:84%
And that, again,
goes into the cloud,

00:30:36.860 --> 00:30:39.530 align:middle line:84%
saying that, OK, you're
not in ketoacidosis,

00:30:39.530 --> 00:30:41.480 align:middle line:84%
you must've ate
some sort of fruit

00:30:41.480 --> 00:30:43.400 align:middle line:84%
or some sort of
bread or something,

00:30:43.400 --> 00:30:46.010 align:middle line:84%
but you're not doing
that at the time.

00:30:46.010 --> 00:30:48.590 align:middle line:84%
So measurement is
the key to find out

00:30:48.590 --> 00:30:50.690 align:middle line:84%
whether something is going
on, not just by taking

00:30:50.690 --> 00:30:52.070 align:middle line:90%
someone's word for it.

00:30:52.070 --> 00:30:57.710 align:middle line:84%
And for these last
100 years, most people

00:30:57.710 --> 00:31:01.130 align:middle line:84%
have been satisfied giving their
power away to a third party

00:31:01.130 --> 00:31:04.370 align:middle line:84%
proxy saying that, oh, you
know how to take care of me,

00:31:04.370 --> 00:31:07.340 align:middle line:84%
please take care of me,
and we lose that muscle

00:31:07.340 --> 00:31:08.510 align:middle line:90%
to take care of ourselves.

00:31:08.510 --> 00:31:09.440 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Absolutely.

00:31:09.440 --> 00:31:10.240 align:middle line:90%
>>ROM: Right?

00:31:10.240 --> 00:31:14.270 align:middle line:90%
So these stressors are good.

00:31:14.270 --> 00:31:17.720 align:middle line:84%
The stressor, by saying that
modern medicine isn't taking

00:31:17.720 --> 00:31:19.400 align:middle line:84%
care of us, is actually
a good stressor

00:31:19.400 --> 00:31:22.430 align:middle line:84%
because it's forcing people to
use our self-reliance muscle.

00:31:22.430 --> 00:31:23.230 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:31:23.230 --> 00:31:24.770 align:middle line:90%
No, I think that's fabulous.

00:31:24.770 --> 00:31:29.270 align:middle line:84%
>>ROM: We need to take
our power back and work

00:31:29.270 --> 00:31:33.230 align:middle line:84%
with the knowledge experts,
which are the doctors,

00:31:33.230 --> 00:31:37.260 align:middle line:84%
and work with them to evolve
our whole system of health care.

00:31:37.260 --> 00:31:39.650 align:middle line:90%
Everything is evolving.

00:31:39.650 --> 00:31:41.690 align:middle line:90%
Even humans are evolving.

00:31:41.690 --> 00:31:47.930 align:middle line:84%
Right now, by Darwin's theory
of evolution, the people that

00:31:47.930 --> 00:31:51.430 align:middle line:84%
can't handle all
the antibiotics, all

00:31:51.430 --> 00:31:55.100 align:middle line:84%
the pesticides and
herbicides, they're dying off.

00:31:55.100 --> 00:31:56.810 align:middle line:84%
And the ones that can
handle it, the ones

00:31:56.810 --> 00:31:59.000 align:middle line:84%
that are able to
adapt, we're going

00:31:59.000 --> 00:32:02.450 align:middle line:84%
to be the ones that are
having children in the future.

00:32:02.450 --> 00:32:05.085 align:middle line:84%
So 200, 300 years
from now, we're

00:32:05.085 --> 00:32:07.460 align:middle line:84%
going to be able to handle
all these levels of pesticides

00:32:07.460 --> 00:32:09.135 align:middle line:84%
and herbicides, but that's
200, 300 years from now.

00:32:09.135 --> 00:32:11.135 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Right, the body
will ultimately adapt.

00:32:11.135 --> 00:32:16.790 align:middle line:84%
OK, so I know this is of concern
to a lot of people watching,

00:32:16.790 --> 00:32:20.385 align:middle line:84%
and we have a high proportion
of women watching this as well,

00:32:20.385 --> 00:32:22.010 align:middle line:84%
and that is the whole
notion you talked

00:32:22.010 --> 00:32:25.210 align:middle line:84%
about a moment ago talking
about ketogenics and weight loss

00:32:25.210 --> 00:32:26.010 align:middle line:90%
and so forth.

00:32:26.010 --> 00:32:30.890 align:middle line:84%
So let's take this from the
notion of chronic inflammation

00:32:30.890 --> 00:32:32.000 align:middle line:90%
in the body.

00:32:32.000 --> 00:32:36.140 align:middle line:84%
We already talked about the
McDonald's kind of phenomena.

00:32:36.140 --> 00:32:42.290 align:middle line:84%
So internal inflammation
are microbial metabolites

00:32:42.290 --> 00:32:45.290 align:middle line:90%
and our metabolism.

00:32:45.290 --> 00:32:47.673 align:middle line:84%
Do those things work
together and flow together?

00:32:47.673 --> 00:32:48.590 align:middle line:90%
>>ROM: Oh, absolutely.

00:32:48.590 --> 00:32:50.090 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So can
you talk about what

00:32:50.090 --> 00:32:52.730 align:middle line:84%
that looks like so we understand
why we're putting on weight?

00:32:52.730 --> 00:32:57.680 align:middle line:84%
And very specifically, even
people who are relatively thin

00:32:57.680 --> 00:33:00.710 align:middle line:84%
have this kind of
pudgy belly weight

00:33:00.710 --> 00:33:04.040 align:middle line:84%
that we did not have
30, 40 years ago,

00:33:04.040 --> 00:33:06.200 align:middle line:84%
and these are
people who are thin.

00:33:06.200 --> 00:33:10.700 align:middle line:84%
So what's going on in
our diets and the lack

00:33:10.700 --> 00:33:13.820 align:middle line:84%
of correct information
that's creating

00:33:13.820 --> 00:33:17.540 align:middle line:84%
this chronic inflammation
that's leading to holding

00:33:17.540 --> 00:33:19.430 align:middle line:90%
excess weight on our bodies?

00:33:19.430 --> 00:33:21.530 align:middle line:84%
And how do we shift
those metabolites

00:33:21.530 --> 00:33:24.590 align:middle line:84%
to helping our metabolism
function better?

00:33:24.590 --> 00:33:25.850 align:middle line:90%
>>ROM: Right.

00:33:25.850 --> 00:33:30.560 align:middle line:84%
So the metabolites that
we're putting in our products

00:33:30.560 --> 00:33:32.060 align:middle line:90%
come from bacteria.

00:33:32.060 --> 00:33:34.310 align:middle line:84%
And in order for the
bacteria to produce

00:33:34.310 --> 00:33:37.040 align:middle line:84%
those type of metabolites with
the right kind of information

00:33:37.040 --> 00:33:40.400 align:middle line:84%
for our bodies to
lower inflammation,

00:33:40.400 --> 00:33:44.030 align:middle line:84%
I'm working on a product
called triple turmeric.

00:33:44.030 --> 00:33:46.760 align:middle line:84%
And we're doing five
different things

00:33:46.760 --> 00:33:49.070 align:middle line:84%
to create the types
of metabolites

00:33:49.070 --> 00:33:52.580 align:middle line:84%
that our body needs to get
that optimal blueprint.

00:33:52.580 --> 00:33:56.180 align:middle line:84%
Again, it's not about
lowering inflammation,

00:33:56.180 --> 00:34:01.610 align:middle line:84%
it's about getting the body to
attach to an optimal blueprint

00:34:01.610 --> 00:34:05.630 align:middle line:84%
to say, this is how I'm
going to heal myself.

00:34:05.630 --> 00:34:09.199 align:middle line:84%
The body's saying, I don't need
help lowering inflammation,

00:34:09.199 --> 00:34:12.440 align:middle line:84%
I just need help getting
pointed in the right direction.

00:34:12.440 --> 00:34:15.650 align:middle line:84%
Get me off of this train,
off of this train track,

00:34:15.650 --> 00:34:17.230 align:middle line:84%
get me on another
train track that's

00:34:17.230 --> 00:34:19.105 align:middle line:84%
going to be pointing me
to another direction.

00:34:19.105 --> 00:34:20.630 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And
turmeric is obviously

00:34:20.630 --> 00:34:23.940 align:middle line:84%
a superfood when it comes to
reducing chronic inflammation.

00:34:23.940 --> 00:34:27.530 align:middle line:84%
>>ROM: It is, but turmeric
is not available in the body.

00:34:27.530 --> 00:34:28.460 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: No.

00:34:28.460 --> 00:34:31.639 align:middle line:84%
>>ROM: Only maybe 99% of
all the turmeric that one

00:34:31.639 --> 00:34:36.800 align:middle line:84%
eats in the body gets excreted,
unless it's fermented, right?

00:34:36.800 --> 00:34:42.350 align:middle line:84%
So what we've done is I've taken
microbes from longevity zones,

00:34:42.350 --> 00:34:46.010 align:middle line:84%
and for our particular microbe
in the triple turmeric product,

00:34:46.010 --> 00:34:48.679 align:middle line:84%
I've taken it from the Punjab
region, where people are really

00:34:48.679 --> 00:34:51.350 align:middle line:90%
skinny in the northern India.

00:34:51.350 --> 00:34:54.530 align:middle line:84%
And they also have
a very low incidence

00:34:54.530 --> 00:34:58.080 align:middle line:84%
of Parkinson's disease
and a low incidence

00:34:58.080 --> 00:34:59.730 align:middle line:84%
of any other
neurodegenerative disease

00:34:59.730 --> 00:35:02.852 align:middle line:84%
because their inflammation
in the brain is very low.

00:35:02.852 --> 00:35:04.560 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And they
also have a high level

00:35:04.560 --> 00:35:05.735 align:middle line:90%
of turmeric in the diet.

00:35:05.735 --> 00:35:07.110 align:middle line:84%
>>ROM: In the
diet, but they also

00:35:07.110 --> 00:35:09.450 align:middle line:84%
have a high level of
particular bacteria

00:35:09.450 --> 00:35:11.550 align:middle line:90%
that grow on the turmeric there.

00:35:11.550 --> 00:35:13.860 align:middle line:84%
It's different from the
bacteria that grows on--

00:35:13.860 --> 00:35:17.390 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So you have brought
that bacteria to your lab?

00:35:17.390 --> 00:35:20.220 align:middle line:84%
>>ROM: Yeah, so we
cultured that bacteria,

00:35:20.220 --> 00:35:24.060 align:middle line:84%
and we're starting to
break down this turmeric

00:35:24.060 --> 00:35:27.720 align:middle line:84%
into bacterial metabolites,
into different curcuminoids,

00:35:27.720 --> 00:35:30.585 align:middle line:84%
secondary, tertiary, and
quaternary curcuminoids,

00:35:30.585 --> 00:35:32.160 align:middle line:90%
and then we're packaging it.

00:35:32.160 --> 00:35:36.180 align:middle line:84%
But that's just the
food portion, right?

00:35:36.180 --> 00:35:39.630 align:middle line:84%
What people don't see, like
in our fermentation room,

00:35:39.630 --> 00:35:41.440 align:middle line:90%
we're creating magnetics.

00:35:41.440 --> 00:35:45.320 align:middle line:84%
I have a nine gauss field
underneath the fermentation

00:35:45.320 --> 00:35:48.390 align:middle line:84%
room, so we have
geodesic information,

00:35:48.390 --> 00:35:50.900 align:middle line:84%
magnetic information,
into the food.

00:35:50.900 --> 00:35:55.750 align:middle line:84%
And I'm also pulsing it
with electromagnetic pulsing

00:35:55.750 --> 00:35:59.460 align:middle line:84%
frequency that the
microbes like when they're

00:35:59.460 --> 00:36:01.680 align:middle line:90%
growing at their finest.

00:36:01.680 --> 00:36:05.280 align:middle line:84%
I mean, they're not doing this
in our food processing labs.

00:36:05.280 --> 00:36:07.410 align:middle line:84%
We're missing the
opportunity to put

00:36:07.410 --> 00:36:10.740 align:middle line:84%
different forms of
information into our products.

00:36:10.740 --> 00:36:15.870 align:middle line:84%
So I've got bacterial
metabolite microbial

00:36:15.870 --> 00:36:17.700 align:middle line:84%
intelligent information
into this product,

00:36:17.700 --> 00:36:21.335 align:middle line:84%
but we also have light
information by putting it in--

00:36:21.335 --> 00:36:24.300 align:middle line:84%
our fermentation rooms are
lined with tourmaline tile,

00:36:24.300 --> 00:36:29.190 align:middle line:84%
so it's giving off a lot of
far infrared natural radiation

00:36:29.190 --> 00:36:31.350 align:middle line:84%
energies that the
microbes really like.

00:36:31.350 --> 00:36:35.320 align:middle line:84%
We've got magnetics, and
then the water that we use

00:36:35.320 --> 00:36:37.320 align:middle line:90%
is completely structured.

00:36:37.320 --> 00:36:39.000 align:middle line:84%
I use this water
from a company called

00:36:39.000 --> 00:36:41.190 align:middle line:90%
Ophora out of Santa Barbara.

00:36:41.190 --> 00:36:42.175 align:middle line:90%
Amazing structure.

00:36:42.175 --> 00:36:43.050 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So what's
the name of it again?

00:36:43.050 --> 00:36:44.140 align:middle line:90%
I'm writing it down.

00:36:44.140 --> 00:36:48.450 align:middle line:90%
>>ROM: Ophora, O-P-H-O-R-A.

00:36:48.450 --> 00:36:50.880 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And so you're
using that in the process.

00:36:50.880 --> 00:36:51.270 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:36:51.270 --> 00:36:52.687 align:middle line:84%
>>ROM: Yeah, it's
hyperoxygenated.

00:36:52.687 --> 00:36:54.970 align:middle line:84%
It's got about 40 parts
per million oxygen.

00:36:54.970 --> 00:36:55.770 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: OK.

00:36:55.770 --> 00:36:57.360 align:middle line:84%
>>ROM: And then
on top of that, I

00:36:57.360 --> 00:37:01.890 align:middle line:84%
take that water and I put a
water crystal that we harvest

00:37:01.890 --> 00:37:05.340 align:middle line:84%
from under Antarctica, under
the Russian side of Antarctica,

00:37:05.340 --> 00:37:09.450 align:middle line:84%
and it crystallizes into
what Gerald Pollack calls

00:37:09.450 --> 00:37:10.530 align:middle line:90%
a fourth phase of water.

00:37:10.530 --> 00:37:13.110 align:middle line:84%
So we've analyzed
this water crystal

00:37:13.110 --> 00:37:15.720 align:middle line:90%
that we've come in our water.

00:37:15.720 --> 00:37:17.850 align:middle line:84%
We call it life
force energy water.

00:37:17.850 --> 00:37:19.740 align:middle line:84%
I don't know if it's
life force energy water,

00:37:19.740 --> 00:37:23.310 align:middle line:84%
but it's crystallized, and
the microbes have that.

00:37:23.310 --> 00:37:27.780 align:middle line:84%
So we have water information,
we have light information,

00:37:27.780 --> 00:37:30.990 align:middle line:84%
we have magnetic information,
we have electrical information,

00:37:30.990 --> 00:37:36.550 align:middle line:84%
and that's all encoded inside
these bacterial metabolites.

00:37:36.550 --> 00:37:38.550 align:middle line:84%
So when I ferment
this turmeric, now

00:37:38.550 --> 00:37:42.600 align:middle line:84%
when I harvest this
fermentation, wow,

00:37:42.600 --> 00:37:44.110 align:middle line:90%
it's amazing.

00:37:44.110 --> 00:37:46.110 align:middle line:84%
And every day we're
doing that even

00:37:46.110 --> 00:37:49.590 align:middle line:84%
with our marine phytoplankton,
which is what I'm drinking now.

00:37:49.590 --> 00:37:50.430 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: OK.

00:37:50.430 --> 00:37:52.770 align:middle line:84%
>>ROM: So the
marine phytoplankton

00:37:52.770 --> 00:37:55.320 align:middle line:84%
and other blue-green
algaes I'm using,

00:37:55.320 --> 00:37:57.160 align:middle line:84%
I'm now experimenting
with blue-green algaes

00:37:57.160 --> 00:38:03.190 align:middle line:84%
from Klamath Lake called
A-floss that in some studies,

00:38:03.190 --> 00:38:05.290 align:middle line:90%
it increases stem cells.

00:38:05.290 --> 00:38:09.910 align:middle line:84%
And I'm using organic
spirulina and marine chlorella

00:38:09.910 --> 00:38:13.620 align:middle line:84%
and nannochloropsis
from different farms

00:38:13.620 --> 00:38:15.690 align:middle line:90%
that are growing these things.

00:38:15.690 --> 00:38:21.180 align:middle line:84%
But after they grow, I'm taking
them, I'm fermenting them,

00:38:21.180 --> 00:38:24.100 align:middle line:84%
and then I'm sticking
them back in the ocean

00:38:24.100 --> 00:38:26.580 align:middle line:84%
so they can gather
all the magnetics

00:38:26.580 --> 00:38:28.980 align:middle line:84%
and the healing
frequencies from the ocean.

00:38:28.980 --> 00:38:32.520 align:middle line:84%
They're in closed vesicles,
but then they're fermenting--

00:38:32.520 --> 00:38:33.800 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: This is so exciting.

00:38:33.800 --> 00:38:34.955 align:middle line:90%
You are crazy!

00:38:34.955 --> 00:38:37.053 align:middle line:90%
I love it.

00:38:37.053 --> 00:38:38.470 align:middle line:84%
>>ROM: I mean, we
have caves, too.

00:38:38.470 --> 00:38:43.560 align:middle line:84%
We're putting them in caves
in Kauai in the ocean,

00:38:43.560 --> 00:38:44.730 align:middle line:90%
so we got to go in there.

00:38:44.730 --> 00:38:48.990 align:middle line:84%
And one time I saw
this turtle starting

00:38:48.990 --> 00:38:53.560 align:middle line:84%
to dig in because he saw all
this marine phytoplankton,

00:38:53.560 --> 00:38:55.142 align:middle line:90%
and that's their food.

00:38:55.142 --> 00:39:01.020 align:middle line:84%
So the turtle was just
like, aah, couldn't get it.

00:39:01.020 --> 00:39:03.720 align:middle line:84%
But it's getting the
nutritional energy

00:39:03.720 --> 00:39:06.150 align:middle line:84%
from geodesic
nutritional energy,

00:39:06.150 --> 00:39:08.240 align:middle line:90%
which is magnetic fields.

00:39:08.240 --> 00:39:11.820 align:middle line:84%
And so when you're taking this
stuff and after it's fermented

00:39:11.820 --> 00:39:14.200 align:middle line:84%
and then I dehydrate it, and
after you take this stuff,

00:39:14.200 --> 00:39:16.788 align:middle line:90%
it's just so alive.

00:39:16.788 --> 00:39:19.080 align:middle line:84%
So I'm going to give you a
bottle of this to take home.

00:39:19.080 --> 00:39:20.760 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: I can't
wait to try it.

00:39:20.760 --> 00:39:21.750 align:middle line:90%
Oh my god.

00:39:21.750 --> 00:39:24.010 align:middle line:84%
No, this is just exciting
hearing about it,

00:39:24.010 --> 00:39:25.800 align:middle line:84%
no less what my
cells might feel.

00:39:25.800 --> 00:39:27.690 align:middle line:84%
>>ROM: We're getting
athletes, we're

00:39:27.690 --> 00:39:30.150 align:middle line:84%
getting these
personal trainers that

00:39:30.150 --> 00:39:33.840 align:middle line:84%
can't believe how fantastic our
marine phytoplankton mix is.

00:39:33.840 --> 00:39:35.640 align:middle line:90%
They said, what's in this stuff?

00:39:35.640 --> 00:39:38.250 align:middle line:90%
Because it just energizes me.

00:39:38.250 --> 00:39:41.460 align:middle line:84%
And marine phytoplankton
and blue-green algae

00:39:41.460 --> 00:39:46.110 align:middle line:84%
has this compound
called DHA, and DHA

00:39:46.110 --> 00:39:49.260 align:middle line:84%
is like a major component
of our cell membranes,

00:39:49.260 --> 00:39:51.230 align:middle line:90%
especially in our brain.

00:39:51.230 --> 00:39:52.980 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: OK, so
thank you for that,

00:39:52.980 --> 00:39:55.560 align:middle line:84%
and thank you for
everything you're doing.

00:39:55.560 --> 00:39:58.020 align:middle line:84%
I mean, you'll go to
any length to make

00:39:58.020 --> 00:40:00.240 align:middle line:90%
the most perfect nutrient.

00:40:00.240 --> 00:40:02.410 align:middle line:84%
I mean, I've known you
for a number of years now,

00:40:02.410 --> 00:40:04.440 align:middle line:84%
and I love what you
do because you're just

00:40:04.440 --> 00:40:07.710 align:middle line:84%
constantly expanding and
growing and adding onto.

00:40:07.710 --> 00:40:10.380 align:middle line:84%
And I think what's happened
with a lot of people,

00:40:10.380 --> 00:40:15.270 align:middle line:84%
I hear this a lot now, that
we're almost afraid to eat.

00:40:15.270 --> 00:40:17.870 align:middle line:84%
It's like you eat food,
your belly just swells up,

00:40:17.870 --> 00:40:20.160 align:middle line:84%
and you think, what the
heck, what was that?

00:40:20.160 --> 00:40:21.780 align:middle line:90%
It's not even gluten.

00:40:21.780 --> 00:40:25.050 align:middle line:84%
And it's like our bodies
are almost becoming allergic

00:40:25.050 --> 00:40:29.100 align:middle line:84%
to the food around us, and
this is a really big cycle

00:40:29.100 --> 00:40:31.740 align:middle line:90%
that has to be transformed.

00:40:31.740 --> 00:40:38.130 align:middle line:84%
And is it that food is really
basically just become filler?

00:40:38.130 --> 00:40:40.680 align:middle line:84%
Or is the food, like we said
before, I think a lot of it's

00:40:40.680 --> 00:40:43.960 align:middle line:84%
devitalizing us and kind
of slowly killing us.

00:40:43.960 --> 00:40:47.820 align:middle line:84%
So how do you go about
your food sources?

00:40:47.820 --> 00:40:50.790 align:middle line:84%
I mean, if you add these
wonderful super nutrients

00:40:50.790 --> 00:40:53.580 align:middle line:84%
and fermented super nutrients
back in, first of all,

00:40:53.580 --> 00:40:55.680 align:middle line:84%
you're giving yourself,
I assume, a little bump,

00:40:55.680 --> 00:40:58.650 align:middle line:84%
a little something to
grow toward, but what

00:40:58.650 --> 00:40:59.820 align:middle line:90%
about the rest of it?

00:40:59.820 --> 00:41:00.660 align:middle line:90%
>>ROM: Right.

00:41:00.660 --> 00:41:02.850 align:middle line:84%
So this is an issue
that I've been

00:41:02.850 --> 00:41:05.420 align:middle line:84%
grappling with for the
last five, six years.

00:41:05.420 --> 00:41:08.340 align:middle line:84%
I said, how would
one differentiate

00:41:08.340 --> 00:41:10.440 align:middle line:90%
one food versus another food?

00:41:10.440 --> 00:41:13.320 align:middle line:84%
Let's say this food
is grown organically,

00:41:13.320 --> 00:41:16.020 align:middle line:84%
and let's say this food was
grown in a commercial farm.

00:41:16.020 --> 00:41:17.520 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Let's
start with organics.

00:41:17.520 --> 00:41:20.550 align:middle line:84%
Assume everyone watching,
and ourselves included,

00:41:20.550 --> 00:41:22.930 align:middle line:90%
are committed to organics.

00:41:22.930 --> 00:41:23.730 align:middle line:90%
But then what?

00:41:23.730 --> 00:41:26.700 align:middle line:84%
>>ROM: But the thing is,
my issue with something

00:41:26.700 --> 00:41:29.190 align:middle line:84%
being labeled organic
and being certified

00:41:29.190 --> 00:41:33.240 align:middle line:84%
organic is, how do you really
know whether that is giving you

00:41:33.240 --> 00:41:34.140 align:middle line:90%
nutrition or not?

00:41:34.140 --> 00:41:36.510 align:middle line:84%
Because organic food
means food that we

00:41:36.510 --> 00:41:37.820 align:middle line:90%
used to create 100 years ago.

00:41:37.820 --> 00:41:39.570 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: It just means
theoretically they

00:41:39.570 --> 00:41:42.430 align:middle line:84%
haven't piled on all the
pesticides, herbicides,

00:41:42.430 --> 00:41:43.860 align:middle line:90%
insecticides, theoretically.

00:41:43.860 --> 00:41:47.430 align:middle line:84%
>>ROM: Theoretically, but a
food can be called organic

00:41:47.430 --> 00:41:50.110 align:middle line:84%
and be sprayed with Roundup
just before harvesting.

00:41:50.110 --> 00:41:50.910 align:middle line:90%
Did you know that?

00:41:50.910 --> 00:41:51.720 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: No.

00:41:51.720 --> 00:41:52.330 align:middle line:90%
>>ROM: Yeah.

00:41:52.330 --> 00:41:53.860 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Oh, that's
so depressing.

00:41:53.860 --> 00:41:58.110 align:middle line:84%
>>ROM: Because Roundup is
not considered any pesticide

00:41:58.110 --> 00:42:00.570 align:middle line:84%
or herbicide, it's actually
considered a drying agent.

00:42:00.570 --> 00:42:02.850 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Glycol phosphates,
what do they do to us?

00:42:02.850 --> 00:42:03.952 align:middle line:90%
>>ROM: Oh god.

00:42:03.952 --> 00:42:05.160 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: I didn't know that.

00:42:05.160 --> 00:42:07.200 align:middle line:84%
>>ROM: Here's another
thing about where

00:42:07.200 --> 00:42:11.130 align:middle line:84%
we're not connected with nature
and we're giving ourselves

00:42:11.130 --> 00:42:14.490 align:middle line:90%
the wrong kind of information.

God made perfect beings,
God made perfect plants.

00:42:18.150 --> 00:42:22.480 align:middle line:84%
And then in the 1980s,
because of our convenience,

00:42:22.480 --> 00:42:25.680 align:middle line:84%
we're saying, you know what, our
herbicides and our pesticides

00:42:25.680 --> 00:42:27.330 align:middle line:84%
aren't working for
this corn anymore,

00:42:27.330 --> 00:42:29.670 align:middle line:84%
wouldn't it be
great if we encoded

00:42:29.670 --> 00:42:33.510 align:middle line:84%
a gene inside the corn
that would kill off

00:42:33.510 --> 00:42:34.540 align:middle line:90%
these different herbs?

>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:43:02.300 --> 00:43:06.110 align:middle line:84%
>>ROM: Yeah, and Monsanto had to
file for basically bankruptcy,

00:43:06.110 --> 00:43:09.180 align:middle line:84%
but they got bought by Bayer,
which is a big pharmaceutical

00:43:09.180 --> 00:43:11.390 align:middle line:90%
company thinking that--

00:43:11.390 --> 00:43:13.230 align:middle line:90%
and why did Bayer buy Monsanto?

00:43:13.230 --> 00:43:14.250 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Why did they?

00:43:14.250 --> 00:43:15.750 align:middle line:84%
>>ROM: Well,
because they thought

00:43:15.750 --> 00:43:17.580 align:middle line:90%
it was in their best interest.

00:43:17.580 --> 00:43:21.990 align:middle line:84%
Even with all the lawsuits
going on with Monsanto,

00:43:21.990 --> 00:43:24.150 align:middle line:84%
they thought that
Monsanto was going

00:43:24.150 --> 00:43:27.600 align:middle line:84%
in the direction good enough
to diversify their portfolio

00:43:27.600 --> 00:43:28.800 align:middle line:90%
of where they were going.

00:43:28.800 --> 00:43:34.890 align:middle line:84%
They didn't think that just
by going for human and animal

00:43:34.890 --> 00:43:36.120 align:middle line:90%
pharmaceuticals was enough.

00:43:36.120 --> 00:43:39.630 align:middle line:84%
They wanted to go into
agricultural biotechnology.

00:43:39.630 --> 00:43:42.630 align:middle line:90%
So it's their business decision.

00:43:42.630 --> 00:43:46.110 align:middle line:84%
But I'm telling you, there's
a lot of intelligence going on

00:43:46.110 --> 00:43:47.480 align:middle line:90%
in the pharmaceutical industry.

00:43:47.480 --> 00:43:50.040 align:middle line:84%
And one of these days, we're
going to figure all this stuff

00:43:50.040 --> 00:43:51.450 align:middle line:90%
out, right?

00:43:51.450 --> 00:43:55.230 align:middle line:84%
This is just a bump in the road
because this is just feedback.

00:43:55.230 --> 00:43:57.360 align:middle line:84%
And one thing
about human beings,

00:43:57.360 --> 00:43:58.980 align:middle line:84%
every time we get
negative feedback,

00:43:58.980 --> 00:44:01.720 align:middle line:84%
we figure out how
to get it better.

00:44:01.720 --> 00:44:05.065 align:middle line:84%
We just can't delude ourselves
that this is the answer.

00:44:05.065 --> 00:44:05.940 align:middle line:90%
That's my only issue.

00:44:05.940 --> 00:44:09.225 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: I know, and it just
keeps getting more extreme.

00:44:09.225 --> 00:44:11.790 align:middle line:84%
>>ROM: And the glycol
phosphate, it's

00:44:11.790 --> 00:44:13.770 align:middle line:84%
making our microbiomes
more extreme

00:44:13.770 --> 00:44:17.970 align:middle line:84%
because it's starting
these micro fungi that

00:44:17.970 --> 00:44:22.530 align:middle line:84%
are causing people to have a
domino effect, and one of them

00:44:22.530 --> 00:44:24.360 align:middle line:90%
is weight gain.

00:44:24.360 --> 00:44:27.840 align:middle line:84%
The reason why we're finding
it so hard to lose weight

00:44:27.840 --> 00:44:30.930 align:middle line:84%
is because the accumulation
of all the herbicides

00:44:30.930 --> 00:44:33.000 align:middle line:84%
and the pesticides and
the chemicals and now

00:44:33.000 --> 00:44:34.950 align:middle line:90%
GMOs into our body.

00:44:34.950 --> 00:44:36.870 align:middle line:84%
And now the water
that we're drinking,

00:44:36.870 --> 00:44:39.390 align:middle line:84%
if we're drinking city
tap water, and some

00:44:39.390 --> 00:44:41.420 align:middle line:84%
of the plastic
water bottles have

00:44:41.420 --> 00:44:44.100 align:middle line:84%
phthalates in the plastic,
especially when those water

00:44:44.100 --> 00:44:47.348 align:middle line:90%
bottles are exposed to sun.

00:44:47.348 --> 00:44:49.140 align:middle line:84%
And then we have all
these pharmaceuticals,

00:44:49.140 --> 00:44:51.250 align:middle line:84%
micro pharmaceuticals,
in our water.

00:44:51.250 --> 00:44:54.360 align:middle line:84%
So our body is just fighting
with all these things,

00:44:54.360 --> 00:44:57.150 align:middle line:90%
and the result is weight gain.

00:44:57.150 --> 00:45:01.020 align:middle line:84%
For example, the two
most prescribed drugs,

00:45:01.020 --> 00:45:03.700 align:middle line:90%
class of drugs, are what?

00:45:03.700 --> 00:45:09.720 align:middle line:84%
Anti-anxiety and the statins,
two most prescribed drugs.

00:45:09.720 --> 00:45:11.550 align:middle line:90%
What's their major side effect?

00:45:11.550 --> 00:45:13.170 align:middle line:90%
Weight gain, right?

00:45:13.170 --> 00:45:18.048 align:middle line:84%
So almost 90% of the population
has one of the two drugs.

00:45:18.048 --> 00:45:19.590 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And even
filtration systems

00:45:19.590 --> 00:45:22.770 align:middle line:90%
don't get these drugs out?

00:45:22.770 --> 00:45:26.050 align:middle line:84%
>>ROM: They don't get the
drugs out because the water,

00:45:26.050 --> 00:45:30.240 align:middle line:84%
when the water is purified,
actually takes on the frequency

00:45:30.240 --> 00:45:31.200 align:middle line:90%
of anything that's--

00:45:31.200 --> 00:45:32.117 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: That's true.

00:45:32.117 --> 00:45:34.020 align:middle line:84%
Homeopathically, it
would still be true.

00:45:34.020 --> 00:45:34.380 align:middle line:90%
>>ROM: Right.

00:45:34.380 --> 00:45:34.530 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Absolutely.

00:45:34.530 --> 00:45:37.090 align:middle line:84%
It's already just taking
in that information.

00:45:37.090 --> 00:45:39.660 align:middle line:84%
>>ROM: So you need to
restructure and get rid

00:45:39.660 --> 00:45:42.345 align:middle line:84%
of all the frequencies
and then restructure

00:45:42.345 --> 00:45:43.890 align:middle line:90%
with additional frequencies.

00:45:43.890 --> 00:45:46.420 align:middle line:90%


00:45:46.420 --> 00:45:51.070 align:middle line:84%
So to come around, when we're
looking at food, I said,

00:45:51.070 --> 00:45:53.880 align:middle line:84%
wouldn't it be great to
be able to measure a food

00:45:53.880 --> 00:45:57.270 align:middle line:84%
and make sure that it has the
right kind of information,

00:45:57.270 --> 00:45:59.760 align:middle line:84%
informational
compounds or metabolics

00:45:59.760 --> 00:46:03.760 align:middle line:84%
in there, to make us get to
the optimum form of wellness?

00:46:03.760 --> 00:46:07.770 align:middle line:84%
Which for lack of a better
term, I'm calling longevity.

00:46:07.770 --> 00:46:12.810 align:middle line:84%
So if something is allowing
us to take the track,

00:46:12.810 --> 00:46:14.960 align:middle line:84%
the train track
to longevity, then

00:46:14.960 --> 00:46:16.710 align:middle line:84%
we don't have to worry
about anything else

00:46:16.710 --> 00:46:19.840 align:middle line:84%
because it'll self-direct,
self-heal, and self-manage

00:46:19.840 --> 00:46:20.640 align:middle line:90%
itself.

00:46:20.640 --> 00:46:21.990 align:middle line:84%
We don't have to worry
about that stuff.

00:46:21.990 --> 00:46:22.920 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Absolutely.

00:46:22.920 --> 00:46:25.140 align:middle line:84%
>>ROM: And I'm calling
these compounds,

00:46:25.140 --> 00:46:31.260 align:middle line:84%
like curcumin is a
longevity compound,

00:46:31.260 --> 00:46:33.300 align:middle line:84%
antioxidants is a
longevity compound,

00:46:33.300 --> 00:46:37.230 align:middle line:84%
anything that increases
our lifespan is

00:46:37.230 --> 00:46:38.400 align:middle line:90%
a longevity compound.

00:46:38.400 --> 00:46:41.520 align:middle line:84%
Resveratrol increases
our lifespan.

00:46:41.520 --> 00:46:43.650 align:middle line:90%
It is a longevity compound.

00:46:43.650 --> 00:46:47.580 align:middle line:84%
So collectively, we're calling
these longevity compounds

00:46:47.580 --> 00:46:49.590 align:middle line:90%
longevicans.

00:46:49.590 --> 00:46:52.170 align:middle line:84%
And I've started a
company called Longevican

00:46:52.170 --> 00:46:54.120 align:middle line:84%
specifically to
measure these compounds

00:46:54.120 --> 00:46:55.360 align:middle line:90%
in the different foods.

00:46:55.360 --> 00:46:59.280 align:middle line:84%
So I would like to start an
open source project where people

00:46:59.280 --> 00:47:01.200 align:middle line:84%
can start taking
whatever supplements,

00:47:01.200 --> 00:47:03.180 align:middle line:84%
whatever foods, and
start identifying

00:47:03.180 --> 00:47:05.740 align:middle line:90%
the longevicans in each food.

00:47:05.740 --> 00:47:08.250 align:middle line:84%
So if you've got
longevicans that

00:47:08.250 --> 00:47:10.800 align:middle line:84%
are pointed for inflammation,
there's certain longevicans,

00:47:10.800 --> 00:47:14.220 align:middle line:84%
like curcumin is
good for longevity,

00:47:14.220 --> 00:47:16.170 align:middle line:84%
but then there are
certain longevicans

00:47:16.170 --> 00:47:20.520 align:middle line:84%
that are good for immunity,
like the longevicans coming out

00:47:20.520 --> 00:47:22.460 align:middle line:90%
of olive leaf extracts.

00:47:22.460 --> 00:47:28.290 align:middle line:84%
Oleuropeins are really good
for optimizing your T-cells

00:47:28.290 --> 00:47:29.770 align:middle line:90%
and B-cells.

00:47:29.770 --> 00:47:33.250 align:middle line:84%
And you've got longevicans
for our mental and emotional

00:47:33.250 --> 00:47:34.050 align:middle line:90%
states.

00:47:34.050 --> 00:47:37.530 align:middle line:84%
For example, like ginsengs,
it has ginsenosides, right?

00:47:37.530 --> 00:47:40.680 align:middle line:84%
So you measure
these longevicans,

00:47:40.680 --> 00:47:43.440 align:middle line:90%
and these are positive scores.

00:47:43.440 --> 00:47:46.780 align:middle line:84%
But then you also measure the
toxins that are really bad.

00:47:46.780 --> 00:47:48.000 align:middle line:90%
Obviously, the heavy metals--

00:47:48.000 --> 00:47:50.550 align:middle line:84%
arsenic, lead,
cadmium, mercury--

00:47:50.550 --> 00:47:52.290 align:middle line:90%
are the big four.

00:47:52.290 --> 00:47:55.860 align:middle line:84%
And then you measure the
herbicides and the pesticides.

00:47:55.860 --> 00:47:59.540 align:middle line:84%
One thing good about the
cannabis and the CBD industry,

00:47:59.540 --> 00:48:03.540 align:middle line:84%
they're making sure that these
supplements are herbicide

00:48:03.540 --> 00:48:06.380 align:middle line:90%
and pesticide and toxin free.

00:48:06.380 --> 00:48:09.900 align:middle line:84%
It's a very responsible industry
that's happening right now,

00:48:09.900 --> 00:48:13.390 align:middle line:84%
and that should be done
for the whole community.

00:48:13.390 --> 00:48:17.340 align:middle line:84%
So with this open source
longevican profiling project,

00:48:17.340 --> 00:48:21.570 align:middle line:84%
we're asking people to
send these projects in,

00:48:21.570 --> 00:48:24.390 align:middle line:84%
and we can measure the
longevity, the longevican

00:48:24.390 --> 00:48:26.080 align:middle line:90%
levels, of these products.

00:48:26.080 --> 00:48:29.400 align:middle line:84%
So let's say that you do
have high inflammation

00:48:29.400 --> 00:48:33.210 align:middle line:84%
and you do have heart disease,
but your blood glucose is fine.

00:48:33.210 --> 00:48:37.470 align:middle line:84%
You'd want a food that
has a positive longevican

00:48:37.470 --> 00:48:44.640 align:middle line:84%
for inflammation and for
cardiovascular health,

00:48:44.640 --> 00:48:49.410 align:middle line:84%
but you don't need a food that's
really high in glucose health.

00:48:49.410 --> 00:48:51.960 align:middle line:84%
You don't need
bitter melon extract,

00:48:51.960 --> 00:48:55.620 align:middle line:84%
or you're not taking
that form in or anything.

00:48:55.620 --> 00:48:59.040 align:middle line:84%
So you can start
creating your own scores

00:48:59.040 --> 00:49:02.558 align:middle line:84%
through this kind of a
longevican profiling system.

00:49:02.558 --> 00:49:04.350 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Well, but
what you're seeing here

00:49:04.350 --> 00:49:06.100 align:middle line:84%
is this is all
under development.

00:49:06.100 --> 00:49:06.900 align:middle line:90%
>>ROM: Yes.

00:49:06.900 --> 00:49:08.470 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: It's not there yet.

00:49:08.470 --> 00:49:11.640 align:middle line:84%
So let's talk about what
people can do here now.

00:49:11.640 --> 00:49:14.250 align:middle line:84%
Now there are a couple of things
that we haven't gotten to,

00:49:14.250 --> 00:49:15.668 align:middle line:90%
but we still have time.

00:49:15.668 --> 00:49:18.210 align:middle line:84%
One of them-- and you and I have
talked privately about this,

00:49:18.210 --> 00:49:26.190 align:middle line:84%
and it has to do with using
ozone water to take your food

00:49:26.190 --> 00:49:29.700 align:middle line:84%
to, if you're going to be
eating your organic fruits

00:49:29.700 --> 00:49:32.310 align:middle line:84%
or vegetables, take it
down to a neutral position

00:49:32.310 --> 00:49:35.280 align:middle line:84%
when it comes to bacteria
and also extending the shelf

00:49:35.280 --> 00:49:36.818 align:middle line:90%
life of your food in doing so.

00:49:36.818 --> 00:49:38.860 align:middle line:84%
So let's talk about that,
because they're saying,

00:49:38.860 --> 00:49:41.400 align:middle line:84%
wait a minute, but you said
we're made of bacteria,

00:49:41.400 --> 00:49:43.890 align:middle line:84%
we should be feeding
ourselves healthy bacteria,

00:49:43.890 --> 00:49:45.510 align:middle line:84%
and then you're
saying, no, we should

00:49:45.510 --> 00:49:49.110 align:middle line:84%
kill the bacteria on the surface
of our vegetables that come in.

00:49:49.110 --> 00:49:51.427 align:middle line:90%
So let's talk about that.

00:49:51.427 --> 00:49:53.010 align:middle line:84%
>>ROM: Well, what
I'd like to focus on

00:49:53.010 --> 00:49:57.552 align:middle line:84%
is getting our foods back
to neutral as possible

00:49:57.552 --> 00:50:01.020 align:middle line:84%
and looking at foods
that have always

00:50:01.020 --> 00:50:03.750 align:middle line:90%
had a connection to nature.

00:50:03.750 --> 00:50:06.690 align:middle line:84%
Like in Bitcoin
terms, I'm calling it

00:50:06.690 --> 00:50:10.500 align:middle line:90%
a proof of life, right?

00:50:10.500 --> 00:50:14.220 align:middle line:84%
So if your product has proof
of life and you can see that

00:50:14.220 --> 00:50:18.000 align:middle line:84%
conveyance all the way
down to from the time

00:50:18.000 --> 00:50:19.110 align:middle line:90%
that it was planted.

00:50:19.110 --> 00:50:23.910 align:middle line:84%
Obviously, if one plants
their own plants in the garden

00:50:23.910 --> 00:50:26.460 align:middle line:84%
and you made your own compost,
you planted your own plants,

00:50:26.460 --> 00:50:28.560 align:middle line:84%
you know exactly how
it's grown, you're

00:50:28.560 --> 00:50:32.973 align:middle line:84%
not going to need to wash
it with ozone to kill off

00:50:32.973 --> 00:50:34.890 align:middle line:84%
all the microbes because
all your microbes are

00:50:34.890 --> 00:50:36.540 align:middle line:84%
good because you
know what's in them.

00:50:36.540 --> 00:50:39.390 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: But when you're buying
things from the grocery store.

00:50:39.390 --> 00:50:40.470 align:middle line:84%
>>ROM: I would
assume that they're--

00:50:40.470 --> 00:50:41.428 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Even organic.

00:50:41.428 --> 00:50:45.840 align:middle line:84%
>>ROM: Yeah, because a lot
of the food that we have,

00:50:45.840 --> 00:50:49.380 align:middle line:84%
believe it or not, has
fecal matter on the food,

00:50:49.380 --> 00:50:53.010 align:middle line:84%
and we want to take
all that stuff out.

00:50:53.010 --> 00:50:54.720 align:middle line:84%
I'm a proponent of
microbes, but that's

00:50:54.720 --> 00:50:56.632 align:middle line:90%
going a little bit too far.

00:50:56.632 --> 00:51:00.800 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So you take
ozone water in a tub?

00:51:00.800 --> 00:51:02.220 align:middle line:90%
Do you just fill a tub of it?

00:51:02.220 --> 00:51:05.240 align:middle line:84%
>>ROM: We have these water
ozonators that we have.

00:51:05.240 --> 00:51:07.710 align:middle line:90%
They're pretty inexpensive.

00:51:07.710 --> 00:51:12.093 align:middle line:84%
And you flip it on,
and it takes air

00:51:12.093 --> 00:51:13.260 align:middle line:90%
and it converts it to ozone.

00:51:13.260 --> 00:51:15.600 align:middle line:84%
You put this ozone
bubbler in your water,

00:51:15.600 --> 00:51:18.182 align:middle line:84%
and then you just bubble
your fruits and vegetables

00:51:18.182 --> 00:51:19.890 align:middle line:84%
and you clean your
fruits and vegetables.

00:51:19.890 --> 00:51:22.230 align:middle line:84%
Instead of getting
a chemical cleaner,

00:51:22.230 --> 00:51:25.130 align:middle line:84%
you bubble it in ozone,
and then, pfhew--

00:51:25.130 --> 00:51:27.630 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: No, that makes perfect
sense because that's what's

00:51:27.630 --> 00:51:29.680 align:middle line:90%
making it slimy on the outside.

00:51:29.680 --> 00:51:32.970 align:middle line:84%
In addition, if you store it
in glass instead of plastics,

00:51:32.970 --> 00:51:38.570 align:middle line:84%
you can really give weeks to
a zucchini or strawberries,

00:51:38.570 --> 00:51:41.295 align:middle line:84%
and they'll stay in
perfect condition.

00:51:41.295 --> 00:51:43.950 align:middle line:84%
>>ROM: These glass containers
that are rectangular and then

00:51:43.950 --> 00:51:45.540 align:middle line:84%
you just kind of
punch them, yeah, we

00:51:45.540 --> 00:51:46.957 align:middle line:84%
can store zucchinis
and cucumbers.

00:51:46.957 --> 00:51:48.457 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: I've used
glass for years,

00:51:48.457 --> 00:51:50.280 align:middle line:84%
and it's amazing how
long stuff lasts.

00:51:50.280 --> 00:51:51.180 align:middle line:90%
>>ROM: Yeah.

00:51:51.180 --> 00:51:54.430 align:middle line:84%
So if you ozonate
it, you clean it up.

00:51:54.430 --> 00:51:57.300 align:middle line:84%
But I would say that after
you clean something up--

00:51:57.300 --> 00:52:00.970 align:middle line:84%
and pasteurization is another
way to clean something up.

00:52:00.970 --> 00:52:02.790 align:middle line:90%
You can actually heat it.

00:52:02.790 --> 00:52:04.200 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Like a flash.

00:52:04.200 --> 00:52:05.077 align:middle line:90%
>>ROM: Flash heat.

00:52:05.077 --> 00:52:07.410 align:middle line:84%
Yeah, but you don't want to
heat it to like 200 degrees.

00:52:07.410 --> 00:52:09.030 align:middle line:90%
You want to heat it to like 160.

00:52:09.030 --> 00:52:12.030 align:middle line:84%
So if you have a
temperature gun and you

00:52:12.030 --> 00:52:14.400 align:middle line:84%
have a big pot of water, if
you don't have an ozonator,

00:52:14.400 --> 00:52:18.337 align:middle line:84%
put a big pot of water
and you can heat it.

00:52:18.337 --> 00:52:20.670 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Just dump it in
quickly for just a little bit,

00:52:20.670 --> 00:52:22.320 align:middle line:90%
a few seconds, pull it out.

00:52:22.320 --> 00:52:23.220 align:middle line:90%
>>ROM: Pull it out.

00:52:23.220 --> 00:52:26.010 align:middle line:84%
And then you can also
use hydrogen peroxide.

00:52:26.010 --> 00:52:29.550 align:middle line:84%
That's another way of
killing off all the microbes.

00:52:29.550 --> 00:52:31.290 align:middle line:84%
But then after you
do that, you want

00:52:31.290 --> 00:52:33.188 align:middle line:90%
to fill it with good microbes.

00:52:33.188 --> 00:52:34.980 align:middle line:84%
You want to inoculate
it with good microbes

00:52:34.980 --> 00:52:39.240 align:middle line:84%
because inoculation
after sterilization

00:52:39.240 --> 00:52:42.000 align:middle line:84%
means that the new team
that's on the microbes,

00:52:42.000 --> 00:52:44.550 align:middle line:84%
it's setting up their own
defensive system there,

00:52:44.550 --> 00:52:48.810 align:middle line:84%
and it prevents all the microbes
to come in and set up shop.

00:52:48.810 --> 00:52:53.240 align:middle line:84%
So I like calling it like empty
out the Walmart parking right.

00:52:53.240 --> 00:52:55.275 align:middle line:90%
You know how Walmart allows RVs?

00:52:55.275 --> 00:52:56.980 align:middle line:90%
I mean, it's an amazing company.

00:52:56.980 --> 00:52:59.760 align:middle line:84%
They'll let you sleep
overnight in their parking lot.

00:52:59.760 --> 00:53:02.610 align:middle line:84%
Well, in our microbes
in our bodies,

00:53:02.610 --> 00:53:06.710 align:middle line:84%
bacterias are like cars, but
the yeasts are kind of like RVs

00:53:06.710 --> 00:53:09.540 align:middle line:84%
and the parasites are
like the semi trucks

00:53:09.540 --> 00:53:13.050 align:middle line:84%
and the viruses are
like motorcycles, right?

00:53:13.050 --> 00:53:14.880 align:middle line:84%
And in a Walmart
parking lot, you

00:53:14.880 --> 00:53:16.980 align:middle line:90%
get all kinds of stuff in there.

00:53:16.980 --> 00:53:18.930 align:middle line:84%
But you want to put
in your good microbes,

00:53:18.930 --> 00:53:21.098 align:middle line:84%
and you want to get
them all set up there.

00:53:21.098 --> 00:53:23.640 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So how do you put the
good microbes in after you've

00:53:23.640 --> 00:53:24.640 align:middle line:90%
cleaned and neutralized?

00:53:24.640 --> 00:53:27.150 align:middle line:84%
>>ROM: Hey, that's a way
for me to plug our product.

00:53:27.150 --> 00:53:28.020 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: OK.

00:53:28.020 --> 00:53:29.070 align:middle line:90%
>>ROM: ProLife.

00:53:29.070 --> 00:53:29.870 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: ProLife?

00:53:29.870 --> 00:53:30.670 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:53:30.670 --> 00:53:32.550 align:middle line:84%
>>ROM: We have a
probiotic product.

00:53:32.550 --> 00:53:36.120 align:middle line:84%
We have about 19 essential
strains from longevity regions

00:53:36.120 --> 00:53:39.570 align:middle line:84%
around the world, and
it's a live probiotic

00:53:39.570 --> 00:53:41.820 align:middle line:84%
that we culture in
our fermentation room.

00:53:41.820 --> 00:53:45.000 align:middle line:84%
And again, this has
magnetic energy,

00:53:45.000 --> 00:53:47.670 align:middle line:84%
it has electrical
energy, pulsing energy.

00:53:47.670 --> 00:53:49.320 align:middle line:90%
It's got light energies into it.

00:53:49.320 --> 00:53:52.110 align:middle line:84%
So these microbes
are ready to go.

00:53:52.110 --> 00:53:56.866 align:middle line:84%
And when you put them in a
solution of coconut water,

00:53:56.866 --> 00:53:58.480 align:middle line:90%
they all come to life.

00:53:58.480 --> 00:54:02.430 align:middle line:84%
And you can literally get
a bunch of coconut water,

00:54:02.430 --> 00:54:05.290 align:middle line:84%
and if you don't have coconut
water, just have regular water,

00:54:05.290 --> 00:54:07.043 align:middle line:84%
put a little bit
of honey in there,

00:54:07.043 --> 00:54:08.460 align:middle line:84%
and then put our
ProLife in there,

00:54:08.460 --> 00:54:10.800 align:middle line:84%
and then soak your
vegetables in there.

00:54:10.800 --> 00:54:13.150 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And now they still
have the same longevity?

00:54:13.150 --> 00:54:13.980 align:middle line:90%
>>ROM: Mm-hmm.

00:54:13.980 --> 00:54:16.272 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Those microbes
aren't going to break it down?

00:54:16.272 --> 00:54:18.560 align:middle line:84%
>>ROM: No, those microbes
don't break it down.

00:54:18.560 --> 00:54:20.320 align:middle line:84%
The microbes that
break things down

00:54:20.320 --> 00:54:23.010 align:middle line:90%
are called saprophytic microbes.

00:54:23.010 --> 00:54:24.420 align:middle line:84%
So we have two
kinds of microbes.

00:54:24.420 --> 00:54:27.550 align:middle line:84%
We have breakdown microbes
called saprophytic microbes,

00:54:27.550 --> 00:54:30.570 align:middle line:84%
and then we have microbes
that actually make life that

00:54:30.570 --> 00:54:31.950 align:middle line:90%
are called biophytic microbes.

00:54:31.950 --> 00:54:34.680 align:middle line:84%
These are all
biophytic microbes.

00:54:34.680 --> 00:54:39.660 align:middle line:84%
The whole circle of "Lion
King" life, the circle of life

00:54:39.660 --> 00:54:45.430 align:middle line:84%
is when things go to spirit
and they become a dead body,

00:54:45.430 --> 00:54:48.240 align:middle line:84%
whether it be a plant
or a human or an animal,

00:54:48.240 --> 00:54:50.460 align:middle line:84%
things break it down,
and those are usually

00:54:50.460 --> 00:54:53.820 align:middle line:90%
the saprophytic microbes.

00:54:53.820 --> 00:54:57.540 align:middle line:84%
Mushrooms are the best
saprophytic microbes for fungi.

00:54:57.540 --> 00:55:00.750 align:middle line:84%
It has things that break things
down to its component parts.

00:55:00.750 --> 00:55:04.450 align:middle line:84%
But then those component parts
are glucose, carbon, nitrogen,

00:55:04.450 --> 00:55:06.067 align:middle line:84%
and potassium, and
whatnot, but they

00:55:06.067 --> 00:55:08.150 align:middle line:84%
have to get built up again
in the building blocks.

00:55:08.150 --> 00:55:10.442 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Well, a lot of
people take mushroom extracts.

00:55:10.442 --> 00:55:11.580 align:middle line:90%
What is that doing?

00:55:11.580 --> 00:55:14.940 align:middle line:84%
>>ROM: Well, the extracts
are not living anymore,

00:55:14.940 --> 00:55:18.810 align:middle line:84%
so the extracts are actually
the stressors in our body.

00:55:18.810 --> 00:55:24.060 align:middle line:84%
Cordyceps has an extract called
Cs-4, and it gives people a ton

00:55:24.060 --> 00:55:25.920 align:middle line:90%
of energy, right?

00:55:25.920 --> 00:55:30.450 align:middle line:84%
But the Cs-4 is an actual
stressor in our body to get

00:55:30.450 --> 00:55:33.750 align:middle line:84%
your body to produce more
energy thinking that it's kind--

00:55:33.750 --> 00:55:35.370 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Ah, I see, I see.

00:55:35.370 --> 00:55:38.750 align:middle line:84%
>>ROM: This is called the
concept of micro hormesis.

00:55:38.750 --> 00:55:41.670 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Yes, what we were
talking about to start with.

00:55:41.670 --> 00:55:44.220 align:middle line:84%
Another thing you talk
about is fermentation

00:55:44.220 --> 00:55:46.950 align:middle line:84%
because you've already mentioned
the fermentation in the process

00:55:46.950 --> 00:55:48.240 align:middle line:90%
of doing what you do.

00:55:48.240 --> 00:55:50.250 align:middle line:84%
But now everybody's
running out and buying

00:55:50.250 --> 00:55:52.680 align:middle line:90%
sauerkraut of all kinds.

00:55:52.680 --> 00:55:57.180 align:middle line:84%
>>ROM: I would suggest
that people still run out

00:55:57.180 --> 00:55:59.850 align:middle line:84%
and buy sauerkraut,
but you don't really

00:55:59.850 --> 00:56:02.550 align:middle line:84%
know the microbes that
are in the sauerkraut.

00:56:02.550 --> 00:56:04.050 align:middle line:84%
And even if they
tell you, you don't

00:56:04.050 --> 00:56:06.420 align:middle line:90%
know how they were made, right?

00:56:06.420 --> 00:56:12.390 align:middle line:84%
And again, just because you
have x number of people,

00:56:12.390 --> 00:56:17.400 align:middle line:84%
again, let's call it an
army, just because you

00:56:17.400 --> 00:56:20.910 align:middle line:84%
have 1,000 raw army
recruits and say, hey, we

00:56:20.910 --> 00:56:22.810 align:middle line:84%
have these microbes
in our product,

00:56:22.810 --> 00:56:24.690 align:middle line:90%
they could be raw army recruits.

00:56:24.690 --> 00:56:28.890 align:middle line:84%
But for us, we train our
microbes into special forces,

00:56:28.890 --> 00:56:32.130 align:middle line:84%
so we only need a few microbes
to exert a lot of effect

00:56:32.130 --> 00:56:35.130 align:middle line:84%
because they have a lot
of intelligence, you know?

00:56:35.130 --> 00:56:39.840 align:middle line:84%
So while the sauerkrauts
and all the fermented foods

00:56:39.840 --> 00:56:41.460 align:middle line:84%
out there are really
great, it would

00:56:41.460 --> 00:56:44.320 align:middle line:84%
be better if you had the
intelligent microbes.

00:56:44.320 --> 00:56:47.940 align:middle line:84%
And we gather our
intelligence to say, OK,

00:56:47.940 --> 00:56:50.330 align:middle line:84%
where are the microbes
of most intelligence?

00:56:50.330 --> 00:56:52.830 align:middle line:84%
Well, we think the microbes
have the most intelligence where

00:56:52.830 --> 00:56:56.280 align:middle line:84%
people live the longest,
called longevity zones.

00:56:56.280 --> 00:56:59.070 align:middle line:84%
So for the last 12 years,
we've been traveling

00:56:59.070 --> 00:57:00.300 align:middle line:90%
these longevity zones--

00:57:00.300 --> 00:57:04.740 align:middle line:84%
Icaria, Greece, Nicoya Peninsula
in Costa Rica, Okinawa, Japan,

00:57:04.740 --> 00:57:07.800 align:middle line:84%
places in Russia, where
people live to a long time--

00:57:07.800 --> 00:57:09.780 align:middle line:90%
and I gather microbes.

00:57:09.780 --> 00:57:13.740 align:middle line:84%
After you neutralize all
of the inherent microbes,

00:57:13.740 --> 00:57:18.330 align:middle line:84%
you want to put new
microbes in your vegetables.

00:57:18.330 --> 00:57:20.700 align:middle line:84%
And whether you soak in them
or whether you chop them up

00:57:20.700 --> 00:57:22.800 align:middle line:84%
and you let them
ferment, fermenting

00:57:22.800 --> 00:57:24.240 align:middle line:90%
them would be better.

00:57:24.240 --> 00:57:29.040 align:middle line:84%
So the project that we're
working on now with our food

00:57:29.040 --> 00:57:32.400 align:middle line:84%
project is we're about to
embark on a new project

00:57:32.400 --> 00:57:36.630 align:middle line:84%
to create prepared dehydrated
foods that people can just

00:57:36.630 --> 00:57:38.430 align:middle line:84%
put in their smoothies
and give to kids

00:57:38.430 --> 00:57:40.920 align:middle line:84%
and make mashed
potatoes, but it's all

00:57:40.920 --> 00:57:42.437 align:middle line:90%
going to be dehydrated.

00:57:42.437 --> 00:57:44.520 align:middle line:84%
But before then, we're
going to ferment everything

00:57:44.520 --> 00:57:48.773 align:middle line:84%
with all these really
live intelligent microbes.

00:57:48.773 --> 00:57:50.190 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: I swear
to God it sounds

00:57:50.190 --> 00:57:52.260 align:middle line:90%
like you're from the future.

00:57:52.260 --> 00:57:53.870 align:middle line:84%
You've dropped in
to kind of start

00:57:53.870 --> 00:57:55.620 align:middle line:84%
setting the templates
for the way forward.

00:57:55.620 --> 00:57:57.240 align:middle line:84%
But then again,
time is non-linear,

00:57:57.240 --> 00:57:59.760 align:middle line:84%
so you're here now,
which is fabulous.

00:57:59.760 --> 00:58:01.710 align:middle line:84%
So all of these things,
like this product

00:58:01.710 --> 00:58:03.810 align:middle line:84%
you're talking about, how
long before these things

00:58:03.810 --> 00:58:07.700 align:middle line:84%
are actually made
available to we humans?

00:58:07.700 --> 00:58:10.380 align:middle line:84%
>>ROM: The longevican powders
are probably coming in

00:58:10.380 --> 00:58:11.550 align:middle line:90%
within the next year or so.

00:58:11.550 --> 00:58:12.717 align:middle line:90%
We've already got the farms.

00:58:12.717 --> 00:58:14.880 align:middle line:84%
We're setting up the
dehydration facilities.

00:58:14.880 --> 00:58:16.920 align:middle line:84%
But again, our dehydration
facilities, we're

00:58:16.920 --> 00:58:19.770 align:middle line:84%
putting CO2 tanks,
hydrogen tanks,

00:58:19.770 --> 00:58:21.420 align:middle line:84%
and we're putting
magnetics in there.

00:58:21.420 --> 00:58:23.520 align:middle line:84%
We're lining everything
with tourmaline.

00:58:23.520 --> 00:58:25.410 align:middle line:90%
Everything just takes time.

00:58:25.410 --> 00:58:28.320 align:middle line:84%
But the main thing
is, we're going

00:58:28.320 --> 00:58:31.620 align:middle line:84%
to be measuring every single one
of our products in accordance

00:58:31.620 --> 00:58:34.830 align:middle line:84%
to how many
longevicans they have.

00:58:34.830 --> 00:58:38.550 align:middle line:84%
And then we're going to
be able to categorize

00:58:38.550 --> 00:58:41.550 align:middle line:84%
our longevicans, longevicans
for inflammation,

00:58:41.550 --> 00:58:43.840 align:middle line:90%
for immunity, or whatnot.

00:58:43.840 --> 00:58:47.820 align:middle line:84%
And it's all based on I have
a four-year-old daughter

00:58:47.820 --> 00:58:50.010 align:middle line:84%
and she has friends,
and I've been

00:58:50.010 --> 00:58:53.363 align:middle line:84%
working with these children
now for the past three years.

00:58:53.363 --> 00:58:55.530 align:middle line:84%
We're just not coming out
with this out of the blue.

00:58:55.530 --> 00:58:59.010 align:middle line:84%
I've been testing these theories
for the last three years.

00:58:59.010 --> 00:59:02.170 align:middle line:84%
And to be able to come up with
a fermented mashed potato that

00:59:02.170 --> 00:59:05.975 align:middle line:84%
still tastes sweet, but
instead of using sugar,

00:59:05.975 --> 00:59:07.350 align:middle line:84%
we use a little
bit of raw honey,

00:59:07.350 --> 00:59:09.690 align:middle line:84%
but we use chicory inulin,
which is a prebiotic,

00:59:09.690 --> 00:59:11.040 align:middle line:90%
but it tastes sweet.

00:59:11.040 --> 00:59:14.600 align:middle line:84%
Then we start growing little
bits of microbes in there,

00:59:14.600 --> 00:59:17.712 align:middle line:84%
and we've given them to
these kids in Hawaii.

00:59:17.712 --> 00:59:19.170 align:middle line:10%
These parents are
saying, you know,

00:59:19.170 --> 00:59:22.260 align:middle line:10%
my child that was a D-plus
average in sixth grade,

00:59:22.260 --> 00:59:25.150 align:middle line:10%
he's in ninth grade now,
he's got a B-minus average.

00:59:25.150 --> 00:59:25.950 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Love it.

00:59:25.950 --> 00:59:28.680 align:middle line:84%
>>ROM: I mean, for a lot of
people, a D-plus to a B-minus

00:59:28.680 --> 00:59:31.780 align:middle line:84%
still isn't great,
but for me, it's huge.

00:59:31.780 --> 00:59:33.930 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: That's a huge leap.

00:59:33.930 --> 00:59:35.000 align:middle line:90%
I love it.

00:59:35.000 --> 00:59:38.370 align:middle line:84%
Well, as always, we
could go on for probably

00:59:38.370 --> 00:59:40.270 align:middle line:84%
another hour easily
on all of this,

00:59:40.270 --> 00:59:41.678 align:middle line:84%
and I just appreciate
what you've

00:59:41.678 --> 00:59:42.720 align:middle line:90%
brought to our attention.

00:59:42.720 --> 00:59:44.860 align:middle line:84%
So really for the
average person,

00:59:44.860 --> 00:59:48.600 align:middle line:84%
we can look to try to go as
organically as we can, then

00:59:48.600 --> 00:59:52.770 align:middle line:84%
try to wash all of the
unfavorable microbes off

00:59:52.770 --> 00:59:53.820 align:middle line:90%
of our food.

00:59:53.820 --> 00:59:55.725 align:middle line:84%
>>ROM: Also, connection to
nature is really important.

00:59:55.725 --> 00:59:57.475 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And connection
to nature hugely.

00:59:57.475 --> 00:59:59.760 align:middle line:84%
>>ROM: So if you can buy
it from a local farm,

00:59:59.760 --> 01:00:01.426 align:middle line:90%
something made with love.

01:00:01.426 --> 01:00:05.700 align:middle line:84%
Any time something is
disconnected, made in a factory

01:00:05.700 --> 01:00:08.310 align:middle line:84%
or being put with
pesticides, you're just--

01:00:08.310 --> 01:00:10.560 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Know your source
of your food if you can.

01:00:10.560 --> 01:00:14.130 align:middle line:84%
And if you eat beef, get
locally raised grass-fed beef.

01:00:14.130 --> 01:00:16.770 align:middle line:84%
If you eat vegetables,
get your local vegetables

01:00:16.770 --> 01:00:19.723 align:middle line:84%
at the farmer's market or from
your neighbor as best we can.

01:00:19.723 --> 01:00:21.390 align:middle line:84%
And then we can always
do some extracts,

01:00:21.390 --> 01:00:25.410 align:middle line:84%
like turmeric, olive leaf
extract you were talking about,

01:00:25.410 --> 01:00:27.180 align:middle line:90%
some of these ginseng.

01:00:27.180 --> 01:00:28.830 align:middle line:84%
We can do these
things for ourselves.

01:00:28.830 --> 01:00:29.630 align:middle line:90%
>>ROM: Yes.

01:00:29.630 --> 01:00:32.640 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Just keep it clean
and do clean water until

01:00:32.640 --> 01:00:34.410 align:middle line:84%
your technology
starts to becoming--

01:00:34.410 --> 01:00:36.272 align:middle line:84%
>>ROM: Ophora water
is amazing water.

01:00:36.272 --> 01:00:37.230 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Ophora water.

01:00:37.230 --> 01:00:38.760 align:middle line:90%
OK, good.

01:00:38.760 --> 01:00:41.560 align:middle line:84%
On that, I think we're
over now out of time.

01:00:41.560 --> 01:00:43.500 align:middle line:84%
So, Compton, thank you
so much for bringing

01:00:43.500 --> 01:00:45.990 align:middle line:84%
all your light and your
knowledge to us once again.

01:00:45.990 --> 01:00:47.080 align:middle line:90%
>>ROM: Thank you.

01:00:47.080 --> 01:00:49.970 align:middle line:10%
>>REGINA: Compton's work can
be found at ascendedhealth.com.

01:00:49.970 --> 01:00:52.232 align:middle line:10%
I'm personally
really psyched to see

01:00:52.232 --> 01:00:54.690 align:middle line:10%
what's going to happen with
these super fermented compounds

01:00:54.690 --> 01:00:55.680 align:middle line:10%
in the future.

01:00:55.680 --> 01:00:57.690 align:middle line:10%
Until next time, thank
you for joining us here

01:00:57.690 --> 01:00:59.130 align:middle line:10%
on "Open Minds."
