00:00:22.005 --> 00:00:24.380 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA MEREDITH: Many of
us have begun looking at life

00:00:24.380 --> 00:00:25.240 align:middle line:90%
as a mystery.

00:00:25.240 --> 00:00:26.990 align:middle line:10%
It's just that we don't
want our own lives

00:00:26.990 --> 00:00:28.810 align:middle line:10%
to be a mystery to us.

00:00:28.810 --> 00:00:31.520 align:middle line:84%
Chetan Parkyn is back with
us with his new book, "Book

00:00:31.520 --> 00:00:33.680 align:middle line:84%
of Destinies", a
human design system

00:00:33.680 --> 00:00:36.080 align:middle line:84%
that lets us in on our
own purpose in life,

00:00:36.080 --> 00:00:37.920 align:middle line:84%
if we haven't already
figured it out.

00:00:37.920 --> 00:00:39.860 align:middle line:84%
And this time, we
have a treat, which

00:00:39.860 --> 00:00:44.360 align:middle line:84%
we have his lovely
wife, Carola Eastwood.

00:00:44.360 --> 00:00:45.860 align:middle line:84%
Do a lot of people
call you Carolyn,

00:00:45.860 --> 00:00:47.270 align:middle line:90%
because it's just more common?

00:00:47.270 --> 00:00:49.019 align:middle line:84%
>> CAROLA EASTWOOD:
No, it doesn't happen.

00:00:49.019 --> 00:00:51.680 align:middle line:84%
But it's a bit to
learn how to pronounce.

00:00:51.680 --> 00:00:52.490 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Carola.

00:00:52.490 --> 00:00:54.114 align:middle line:84%
The only reason I
knew how to pronounce

00:00:54.114 --> 00:00:56.290 align:middle line:84%
is because of a
little time in India.

00:00:56.290 --> 00:00:58.100 align:middle line:84%
And both of you have
spent time in India.

00:00:58.100 --> 00:01:00.460 align:middle line:84%
And we're going to get back
to that in a little bit.

00:01:00.460 --> 00:01:02.330 align:middle line:84%
But first of all,
tell us a little bit

00:01:02.330 --> 00:01:04.220 align:middle line:84%
about this particular
book as a follow up

00:01:04.220 --> 00:01:05.630 align:middle line:90%
from our last conversation.

00:01:05.630 --> 00:01:08.030 align:middle line:84%
A lot of people watching this
saw our last conversation,

00:01:08.030 --> 00:01:12.380 align:middle line:84%
and how this one kind
of grew out of that one.

00:01:12.380 --> 00:01:14.870 align:middle line:10%
>> CHETAN PARKYN: Everybody
has a purpose in life,

00:01:14.870 --> 00:01:16.400 align:middle line:10%
across the board.

00:01:16.400 --> 00:01:18.980 align:middle line:10%
And yet, there's a very
difficult way of finding out.

00:01:18.980 --> 00:01:21.380 align:middle line:84%
We go to school, we get
everybody else's ideas

00:01:21.380 --> 00:01:23.300 align:middle line:84%
of who we are and
what we're about.

00:01:23.300 --> 00:01:25.370 align:middle line:84%
And so Carola and I
realized we really

00:01:25.370 --> 00:01:29.330 align:middle line:84%
had to set the picture straight
so everybody can find out

00:01:29.330 --> 00:01:31.850 align:middle line:90%
exactly what they came here for.

00:01:31.850 --> 00:01:35.090 align:middle line:84%
There are 192 of these
different life themes.

00:01:35.090 --> 00:01:36.620 align:middle line:90%
All of us have one--

00:01:36.620 --> 00:01:40.375 align:middle line:84%
part of our soul agreement,
part of what carries us in here.

00:01:40.375 --> 00:01:42.500 align:middle line:84%
And when you understand
your soul agreement and you

00:01:42.500 --> 00:01:45.720 align:middle line:84%
understand your life
theme-- your life path--

00:01:45.720 --> 00:01:48.120 align:middle line:90%
you just find the resonance.

00:01:48.120 --> 00:01:51.460 align:middle line:84%
And everything starts opening up
in a very, very different way.

00:01:51.460 --> 00:01:54.650 align:middle line:84%
So there was a big driver
for us to be able to do this.

00:01:54.650 --> 00:01:55.450 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Indeed.

00:01:55.450 --> 00:01:57.074 align:middle line:84%
And you know, it
takes a certain amount

00:01:57.074 --> 00:01:58.680 align:middle line:90%
of courage for a person to ask.

00:01:58.680 --> 00:02:02.010 align:middle line:84%
Because sometimes, you
don't want to ask in a way,

00:02:02.010 --> 00:02:04.440 align:middle line:84%
because you don't really want
an answer that's not already

00:02:04.440 --> 00:02:07.350 align:middle line:84%
lining up with what you've
constructed as a life,

00:02:07.350 --> 00:02:10.919 align:middle line:84%
because it might require
massive amounts of change.

00:02:10.919 --> 00:02:13.350 align:middle line:84%
I mean, I know you've
encountered that as well.

00:02:13.350 --> 00:02:15.730 align:middle line:84%
Many times, when you do a
person's reading, for example,

00:02:15.730 --> 00:02:16.530 align:middle line:90%
right?

00:02:16.530 --> 00:02:18.790 align:middle line:84%
>> EASTWOOD: Yes,
that's absolutely true.

00:02:18.790 --> 00:02:21.450 align:middle line:10%
But the beauty of it
is that what we do

00:02:21.450 --> 00:02:23.820 align:middle line:10%
is we actually help
people to align

00:02:23.820 --> 00:02:26.010 align:middle line:10%
with what they came here for--

00:02:26.010 --> 00:02:28.020 align:middle line:10%
their purpose,
their destiny path.

00:02:28.020 --> 00:02:29.740 align:middle line:84%
It's the book of
destinies, right?

00:02:29.740 --> 00:02:31.000 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Right.

00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:37.280 align:middle line:84%
>> EASTWOOD: So what happens
is that when we realize what

00:02:37.280 --> 00:02:40.934 align:middle line:84%
our destiny path is, when we
hear it for the first time,

00:02:40.934 --> 00:02:43.100 align:middle line:84%
if it's not something that's
been in our awareness--

00:02:43.100 --> 00:02:44.810 align:middle line:90%
and it isn't for many of us--

00:02:44.810 --> 00:02:49.220 align:middle line:84%
then, there's such a
joy that happens also,

00:02:49.220 --> 00:02:51.020 align:middle line:90%
in just the recognition.

00:02:51.020 --> 00:02:53.150 align:middle line:84%
I mean, we've had
people crying, just

00:02:53.150 --> 00:02:58.120 align:middle line:84%
tears running down their face
in recognition of, oh, my god.

00:02:58.120 --> 00:03:00.350 align:middle line:90%
Yes, that's what I'm here for.

00:03:00.350 --> 00:03:03.080 align:middle line:84%
Because there's a lot of angst
when people don't know what

00:03:03.080 --> 00:03:03.994 align:middle line:90%
they're here for.

00:03:03.994 --> 00:03:04.910 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Absolutely.

00:03:04.910 --> 00:03:07.400 align:middle line:84%
And when you're looking at
a community like this one

00:03:07.400 --> 00:03:10.630 align:middle line:84%
and our viewers who are very
intelligent, well-researched,

00:03:10.630 --> 00:03:11.430 align:middle line:90%
and so forth.

00:03:11.430 --> 00:03:13.940 align:middle line:84%
But still, many,
many people haven't

00:03:13.940 --> 00:03:16.837 align:middle line:84%
stumbled upon within themselves,
what they're really here for.

00:03:16.837 --> 00:03:18.420 align:middle line:84%
And they're still
asking the question.

00:03:18.420 --> 00:03:21.260 align:middle line:84%
I know a lot of people that
have gone through their life,

00:03:21.260 --> 00:03:22.970 align:middle line:84%
they've now retired
from whatever

00:03:22.970 --> 00:03:26.700 align:middle line:84%
their career path was, I still
don't know what I'm here to do.

00:03:26.700 --> 00:03:30.830 align:middle line:84%
And I'd look at that and think,
I'd be panic-stricken if I

00:03:30.830 --> 00:03:32.360 align:middle line:90%
had that feeling, you know?

00:03:32.360 --> 00:03:36.120 align:middle line:84%
I guess because I've always kind
of known on some native level.

00:03:36.120 --> 00:03:40.130 align:middle line:84%
But how painful
must that be to not

00:03:40.130 --> 00:03:44.370 align:middle line:84%
know what you're here for, and
to be living out this drama?

00:03:44.370 --> 00:03:45.720 align:middle line:90%
>> PARKYN: Drama is right.

00:03:45.720 --> 00:03:49.440 align:middle line:84%
And distractions as well,
so many distractions,

00:03:49.440 --> 00:03:52.320 align:middle line:84%
so many ideals of
what life could be.

00:03:52.320 --> 00:03:55.160 align:middle line:84%
We have the Hollywood picture,
the life happy ever after.

00:03:55.160 --> 00:03:57.990 align:middle line:84%
And then, we have the
big dramas everywhere.

00:03:57.990 --> 00:04:01.200 align:middle line:84%
And it's so easy to get drawn
off into other people's ideas

00:04:01.200 --> 00:04:03.480 align:middle line:84%
of who we are and
what we're about.

00:04:03.480 --> 00:04:06.450 align:middle line:84%
And Carola's and my work, that
is entirely what we're about,

00:04:06.450 --> 00:04:10.980 align:middle line:84%
is helping people redirect
into what they came here for,

00:04:10.980 --> 00:04:13.020 align:middle line:90%
and to live it to the full.

00:04:13.020 --> 00:04:14.170 align:middle line:90%
There are no duplicates.

00:04:14.170 --> 00:04:16.380 align:middle line:84%
I said this the last time
we were talking about this.

00:04:16.380 --> 00:04:19.316 align:middle line:84%
There are no duplicates in
the whole of the universe.

00:04:19.316 --> 00:04:20.940 align:middle line:84%
No two people are
living the same life.

00:04:20.940 --> 00:04:21.779 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Right.

00:04:21.779 --> 00:04:23.945 align:middle line:84%
>> PARKYN: And until you
find out what you came here

00:04:23.945 --> 00:04:27.100 align:middle line:84%
for, and remember it, and
start enacting it, yeah,

00:04:27.100 --> 00:04:29.990 align:middle line:84%
you are bobbing around in
everybody else's idea of what

00:04:29.990 --> 00:04:30.790 align:middle line:90%
life is.

00:04:30.790 --> 00:04:33.290 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: Well, you're looking
at either what your societal

00:04:33.290 --> 00:04:35.220 align:middle line:84%
structure, your family's
idea of what life is,

00:04:35.220 --> 00:04:37.428 align:middle line:84%
trying to replicate out what
you've done historically

00:04:37.428 --> 00:04:39.360 align:middle line:84%
in your family or
your bloodline.

00:04:39.360 --> 00:04:43.050 align:middle line:84%
And essentially, it leads to a
kind of vacancy, like you say,

00:04:43.050 --> 00:04:46.580 align:middle line:84%
that leads to
primarily distraction,

00:04:46.580 --> 00:04:49.410 align:middle line:84%
or the white picket
fence syndrome.

00:04:49.410 --> 00:04:52.610 align:middle line:84%
But still, on your deathbed,
asking the question.

00:04:52.610 --> 00:04:58.460 align:middle line:84%
And I wish I had his birth date,
but my former father-in-law,

00:04:58.460 --> 00:05:01.820 align:middle line:84%
on his death bed, he
was a man who ended up

00:05:01.820 --> 00:05:02.960 align:middle line:90%
converting to Mormonism.

00:05:02.960 --> 00:05:04.100 align:middle line:90%
He was a good Mormon.

00:05:04.100 --> 00:05:05.270 align:middle line:90%
He had his kids.

00:05:05.270 --> 00:05:08.400 align:middle line:84%
He worked with his brother in
a business and did all of this.

00:05:08.400 --> 00:05:11.780 align:middle line:84%
And my son asked him, when
he was on his deathbed,

00:05:11.780 --> 00:05:15.030 align:middle line:84%
is there anything you
would like to have done?

00:05:15.030 --> 00:05:18.860 align:middle line:84%
And he said, I regret
every day that I didn't

00:05:18.860 --> 00:05:20.900 align:middle line:90%
follow my path as an actor.

00:05:20.900 --> 00:05:24.830 align:middle line:84%
Before he was married, he was
an actor in community theater,

00:05:24.830 --> 00:05:28.490 align:middle line:84%
very handsome Marlon
Brando-esque kind of guy.

00:05:28.490 --> 00:05:32.630 align:middle line:84%
And loved it, and got married,
did the sensible thing.

00:05:32.630 --> 00:05:34.280 align:middle line:90%
Never picked it up again.

00:05:34.280 --> 00:05:37.340 align:middle line:84%
And that was what was on
his kind of dying lips.

00:05:37.340 --> 00:05:40.170 align:middle line:84%
And no one wants to
end up like that.

00:05:40.170 --> 00:05:41.670 align:middle line:84%
>> PARKYN: Well,
that is our work.

00:05:41.670 --> 00:05:42.080 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Yes.

00:05:42.080 --> 00:05:44.538 align:middle line:84%
>> PARKYN: Getting people lined
up with what they came here

00:05:44.538 --> 00:05:46.240 align:middle line:90%
for, and to go for it.

00:05:46.240 --> 00:05:47.040 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Yeah.

00:05:47.040 --> 00:05:48.920 align:middle line:84%
Yeah, I mean, even
if you're retired,

00:05:48.920 --> 00:05:50.990 align:middle line:84%
you can still go back
to acting classes

00:05:50.990 --> 00:05:52.310 align:middle line:90%
and do community theater.

00:05:52.310 --> 00:05:53.630 align:middle line:90%
You know, it's never too late.

00:05:53.630 --> 00:05:55.310 align:middle line:90%
Would you say that's true?

00:05:55.310 --> 00:05:57.720 align:middle line:84%
>> PARKYN: I read for
people of all ages,

00:05:57.720 --> 00:06:00.690 align:middle line:90%
all different places in life.

00:06:00.690 --> 00:06:03.200 align:middle line:84%
And yes, I've read for
people in their 90's.

00:06:03.200 --> 00:06:06.770 align:middle line:84%
And have them say to
me, how refreshing it

00:06:06.770 --> 00:06:09.736 align:middle line:84%
is to hear this,
because now, yes,

00:06:09.736 --> 00:06:11.360 align:middle line:84%
I've kind of avoided
this a little bit.

00:06:11.360 --> 00:06:14.990 align:middle line:84%
But I still have time to
start engaging more and more

00:06:14.990 --> 00:06:16.259 align:middle line:90%
with what I came here for.

00:06:16.259 --> 00:06:18.050 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: That's a
beautiful hopeful part.

00:06:18.050 --> 00:06:20.890 align:middle line:84%
Before we even set the stage for
the rest of the conversation,

00:06:20.890 --> 00:06:23.610 align:middle line:84%
let's set the stage a
little bit for you two.

00:06:23.610 --> 00:06:27.200 align:middle line:84%
Because I know in your
past, India played a part.

00:06:27.200 --> 00:06:29.720 align:middle line:84%
And let's talk about how
you two came together,

00:06:29.720 --> 00:06:31.550 align:middle line:90%
and how your destinies--

00:06:31.550 --> 00:06:34.910 align:middle line:84%
personal destinies-- intersected
to be here with me today.

00:06:34.910 --> 00:06:37.620 align:middle line:90%


00:06:37.620 --> 00:06:39.720 align:middle line:84%
>> EASTWOOD: I met
Chetan first in a dream.

00:06:39.720 --> 00:06:42.490 align:middle line:90%
He came to me in a dream.

00:06:42.490 --> 00:06:44.490 align:middle line:84%
And it was one of those
dreams that wakes you up

00:06:44.490 --> 00:06:45.270 align:middle line:90%
in the middle of the night.

00:06:45.270 --> 00:06:46.811 align:middle line:84%
And you're almost
sitting up, but you

00:06:46.811 --> 00:06:49.710 align:middle line:84%
know you have to sit
up and pay attention.

00:06:49.710 --> 00:06:52.950 align:middle line:84%
And in the dream, he said,
are you going to come find me?

00:06:52.950 --> 00:06:55.830 align:middle line:84%
Because if not, I'm going
to go live in an ashram.

00:06:55.830 --> 00:06:58.980 align:middle line:84%
In the dream, I said
to him, no, I'm coming.

00:06:58.980 --> 00:06:59.820 align:middle line:90%
And then I woke up.

00:06:59.820 --> 00:07:02.692 align:middle line:84%
And I knew that I
had met my soul mate.

00:07:02.692 --> 00:07:03.650 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Interesting.

00:07:03.650 --> 00:07:04.580 align:middle line:90%
>> EASTWOOD: Yes.

00:07:04.580 --> 00:07:06.320 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: OK.

00:07:06.320 --> 00:07:09.050 align:middle line:84%
I would launch into a story
just like that, actually.

00:07:09.050 --> 00:07:10.040 align:middle line:90%
That's fascinating.

00:07:10.040 --> 00:07:13.440 align:middle line:84%
Yes, OK, what was
your side of it?

00:07:13.440 --> 00:07:16.105 align:middle line:90%
You were headed to an ashram--

00:07:16.105 --> 00:07:17.950 align:middle line:84%
>> PARKYN: Well, it's
conceivable, actually,

00:07:17.950 --> 00:07:20.140 align:middle line:84%
at the time, now
that I think of it.

00:07:20.140 --> 00:07:22.240 align:middle line:84%
I was actually living
on Maui at the time.

00:07:22.240 --> 00:07:24.490 align:middle line:84%
I had been reading
for people ever

00:07:24.490 --> 00:07:28.615 align:middle line:84%
since I'd met a reader in
India-- a shadow reader.

00:07:28.615 --> 00:07:30.750 align:middle line:90%
And he told me all about myself.

00:07:30.750 --> 00:07:33.250 align:middle line:84%
And that was my livelihood,
was reading for people.

00:07:33.250 --> 00:07:36.910 align:middle line:84%
I'd read hands, cards,
faces, whatever.

00:07:36.910 --> 00:07:39.570 align:middle line:84%
And I was working
with human design.

00:07:39.570 --> 00:07:41.280 align:middle line:84%
And I got to a point
in my understanding

00:07:41.280 --> 00:07:43.650 align:middle line:84%
with human design, where
I started traveling around

00:07:43.650 --> 00:07:45.450 align:middle line:90%
teaching people about it.

00:07:45.450 --> 00:07:49.500 align:middle line:84%
And I made this trip to
the west coast of America,

00:07:49.500 --> 00:07:51.510 align:middle line:90%
and to San Francisco.

00:07:51.510 --> 00:07:56.490 align:middle line:84%
And sure enough, in one of
my classes, Carola walks in.

00:07:56.490 --> 00:07:58.890 align:middle line:84%
And there's no way
that I could not

00:07:58.890 --> 00:08:02.020 align:middle line:84%
recognize somebody very amazing
who just walked into my life.

00:08:02.020 --> 00:08:02.820 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Right.

00:08:02.820 --> 00:08:05.430 align:middle line:84%
>> PARKYN: It took a little bit
of time for us to work things

00:08:05.430 --> 00:08:07.050 align:middle line:90%
out, then we got together.

00:08:07.050 --> 00:08:11.040 align:middle line:84%
But it's one of those
moments where, pay attention.

00:08:11.040 --> 00:08:11.840 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Right.

00:08:11.840 --> 00:08:14.220 align:middle line:84%
And did you know when
you were in the class

00:08:14.220 --> 00:08:16.740 align:middle line:84%
that your dream had
been about Chetan?

00:08:16.740 --> 00:08:20.100 align:middle line:84%
>> EASTWOOD: I did know, but
I was told in meditation a few

00:08:20.100 --> 00:08:22.110 align:middle line:90%
days before I flew up there.

00:08:22.110 --> 00:08:23.940 align:middle line:84%
Because I didn't know
at first, when I went

00:08:23.940 --> 00:08:25.470 align:middle line:90%
to take the human design class.

00:08:25.470 --> 00:08:29.800 align:middle line:84%
I just knew I was vitally
interested in human design.

00:08:29.800 --> 00:08:31.470 align:middle line:84%
And I found out
Chetan was teaching.

00:08:31.470 --> 00:08:33.730 align:middle line:84%
And I lived in San Diego,
he in San Francisco.

00:08:33.730 --> 00:08:35.190 align:middle line:90%
So I didn't know.

00:08:35.190 --> 00:08:39.690 align:middle line:84%
But in meditation, I was given
really direct guidance that

00:08:39.690 --> 00:08:42.120 align:middle line:84%
said, you're going to
meet your soul mate.

00:08:42.120 --> 00:08:46.280 align:middle line:84%
And he may not recognize
you right at first.

00:08:46.280 --> 00:08:47.990 align:middle line:90%
But you're about to meet him.

00:08:47.990 --> 00:08:50.722 align:middle line:90%
So I had that feeling.

00:08:50.722 --> 00:08:52.180 align:middle line:84%
And then, when he
opened the door--

00:08:52.180 --> 00:08:54.940 align:middle line:84%
when I arrived at the class
and he opened the door

00:08:54.940 --> 00:08:57.610 align:middle line:84%
and I looked at him, I
knew that it was him.

00:08:57.610 --> 00:08:59.471 align:middle line:84%
I recognized him from
the dream I'd had.

00:08:59.471 --> 00:09:01.720 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: Men usually take
a little longer to get it.

00:09:01.720 --> 00:09:03.621 align:middle line:90%
>> PARKYN: We're a bit slow.

00:09:03.621 --> 00:09:05.870 align:middle line:84%
>> EASTWOOD: At least I was
forewarned of that, right?

00:09:05.870 --> 00:09:06.490 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Exactly.

00:09:06.490 --> 00:09:07.450 align:middle line:90%
So you knew that.

00:09:07.450 --> 00:09:07.680 align:middle line:90%
>> EASTWOOD: Yes.

00:09:07.680 --> 00:09:08.720 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: So you
didn't take it personal.

00:09:08.720 --> 00:09:10.350 align:middle line:84%
>> EASTWOOD: My ego couldn't
have gotten, you know--

00:09:10.350 --> 00:09:12.190 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: And that he didn't
recognize you instantly

00:09:12.190 --> 00:09:13.900 align:middle line:84%
in the same way, just
that you were special.

00:09:13.900 --> 00:09:14.780 align:middle line:90%
>> EASTWOOD: Yeah.

00:09:14.780 --> 00:09:15.820 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: And you
know, last time,

00:09:15.820 --> 00:09:17.530 align:middle line:84%
we talked about your
travels in India,

00:09:17.530 --> 00:09:19.450 align:middle line:84%
and this man you met
to do the shadow work.

00:09:19.450 --> 00:09:24.200 align:middle line:84%
Now, is this the same sadhu
that you met that ignored you?

00:09:24.200 --> 00:09:25.600 align:middle line:90%
Or is that a different one?

00:09:25.600 --> 00:09:26.740 align:middle line:84%
>> PARKYN: That was
a different one.

00:09:26.740 --> 00:09:28.310 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: I want to
talk about him this time.

00:09:28.310 --> 00:09:29.740 align:middle line:90%
So let's go back to India.

00:09:29.740 --> 00:09:32.950 align:middle line:84%
Now, you're leading tours
over there in dusty buses.

00:09:32.950 --> 00:09:35.350 align:middle line:84%
And you know, Osho
community is part of it.

00:09:35.350 --> 00:09:36.410 align:middle line:90%
You had a lot going on.

00:09:36.410 --> 00:09:38.500 align:middle line:90%
It was a fun youth, OK?

00:09:38.500 --> 00:09:41.500 align:middle line:84%
OK, so now, tell
us about the sadhu.

00:09:41.500 --> 00:09:44.000 align:middle line:84%
>> PARKYN: So I was driving
a thing called Magic Bus.

00:09:44.000 --> 00:09:44.950 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Yes.

00:09:44.950 --> 00:09:49.210 align:middle line:84%
>> PARKYN: London to Kathmandu,
$60 one way for anyone that was

00:09:49.210 --> 00:09:52.240 align:middle line:90%
brave enough to get on board.

00:09:52.240 --> 00:09:55.090 align:middle line:84%
And in those days,
it was pre-internet.

00:09:55.090 --> 00:09:57.880 align:middle line:84%
And so I'd drive around
all the cafes in Europe.

00:09:57.880 --> 00:10:00.730 align:middle line:84%
And people would know,
there's a Magic Bus coming,

00:10:00.730 --> 00:10:02.080 align:middle line:90%
going to India.

00:10:02.080 --> 00:10:03.520 align:middle line:90%
Jump on board, if you're ready.

00:10:03.520 --> 00:10:05.210 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: Did some people
just jump on, on the spur

00:10:05.210 --> 00:10:05.880 align:middle line:90%
of the moment?

00:10:05.880 --> 00:10:06.050 align:middle line:90%
>> PARKYN: Literally.

00:10:06.050 --> 00:10:07.633 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: They just
said, sure, dude.

00:10:07.633 --> 00:10:08.440 align:middle line:90%
I'm down with it.

00:10:08.440 --> 00:10:09.939 align:middle line:84%
>> PARKYN: It was
that kind of time.

00:10:09.939 --> 00:10:11.170 align:middle line:90%
It was the late '70s.

00:10:11.170 --> 00:10:12.730 align:middle line:90%
And so, we'd take off.

00:10:12.730 --> 00:10:13.660 align:middle line:90%
We'd go across Europe.

00:10:13.660 --> 00:10:16.360 align:middle line:84%
We'd go through what
was then Yugoslavia.

00:10:16.360 --> 00:10:17.844 align:middle line:90%
And then, we'd go into Greece.

00:10:17.844 --> 00:10:19.510 align:middle line:84%
And then, we'd go
into Turkey, which was

00:10:19.510 --> 00:10:21.810 align:middle line:90%
a military regime at the time.

00:10:21.810 --> 00:10:22.960 align:middle line:90%
We'd go into Iran.

00:10:22.960 --> 00:10:26.110 align:middle line:84%
The Shah was still there, but
it was getting a little awkward.

00:10:26.110 --> 00:10:28.510 align:middle line:84%
And then, we'd go into
Afghanistan, into Pakistan,

00:10:28.510 --> 00:10:29.520 align:middle line:90%
into India.

00:10:29.520 --> 00:10:30.895 align:middle line:84%
And then I'd end
up in Kathmandu.

00:10:30.895 --> 00:10:32.650 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: What exciting times.

00:10:32.650 --> 00:10:35.650 align:middle line:84%
>> PARKYN: Amazing,
amazing times.

00:10:35.650 --> 00:10:38.200 align:middle line:84%
I loved the journeys,
I loved the passengers.

00:10:38.200 --> 00:10:40.330 align:middle line:84%
I loved the people
that greeted us.

00:10:40.330 --> 00:10:44.020 align:middle line:84%
So the particular occasion,
the sadhu you're talking about,

00:10:44.020 --> 00:10:46.150 align:middle line:90%
this was in Kathmandu.

00:10:46.150 --> 00:10:49.180 align:middle line:84%
I had finished the trip and
I'd met this Swiss couple.

00:10:49.180 --> 00:10:51.245 align:middle line:84%
And we decided to
have dinner together.

00:10:51.245 --> 00:10:53.620 align:middle line:84%
So I was sitting in this little
restaurant having dinner,

00:10:53.620 --> 00:10:55.720 align:middle line:84%
and there's a sadhu
dressed in orange

00:10:55.720 --> 00:10:59.890 align:middle line:84%
with his begging bowl and his
staff, standing in the doorway.

00:10:59.890 --> 00:11:02.140 align:middle line:84%
And apparently, he'd met
the Swiss couple earlier

00:11:02.140 --> 00:11:03.340 align:middle line:90%
on in the day.

00:11:03.340 --> 00:11:06.277 align:middle line:84%
And we invited him in, he came
and had a cup of tea with us.

00:11:06.277 --> 00:11:08.110 align:middle line:84%
And he started talking
with the Swiss couple

00:11:08.110 --> 00:11:10.207 align:middle line:90%
all about their past lives.

00:11:10.207 --> 00:11:12.790 align:middle line:84%
And I was sitting there, and I
was definitely the odd man out.

00:11:12.790 --> 00:11:14.310 align:middle line:90%
He would not talk to me.

00:11:14.310 --> 00:11:15.910 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: And you
did not like that.

00:11:15.910 --> 00:11:16.630 align:middle line:90%
>> PARKYN: I didn't like it.

00:11:16.630 --> 00:11:18.921 align:middle line:84%
And I interrupted, I said,
can't you tell me something?

00:11:18.921 --> 00:11:20.890 align:middle line:84%
And he just turns
and looks at me.

00:11:20.890 --> 00:11:23.080 align:middle line:84%
And he says, full moon
birthday, and then

00:11:23.080 --> 00:11:25.319 align:middle line:84%
turns back and starts
talking to this couple again.

00:11:25.319 --> 00:11:27.610 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: Well, he threw
you a crumb, that's about it.

00:11:27.610 --> 00:11:28.700 align:middle line:84%
>> PARKYN: Well, he
was right, you know?

00:11:28.700 --> 00:11:29.930 align:middle line:90%
It stopped me in my tracks.

00:11:29.930 --> 00:11:32.090 align:middle line:90%
Yes, I was born on a full moon.

00:11:32.090 --> 00:11:34.900 align:middle line:84%
So then, this goes on for
another 20 minutes or so.

00:11:34.900 --> 00:11:37.116 align:middle line:84%
And I lose my patience,
and I said, look,

00:11:37.116 --> 00:11:38.990 align:middle line:84%
there must be something
else you can tell me.

00:11:38.990 --> 00:11:41.281 align:middle line:84%
Because he is telling them
all these fascinating things

00:11:41.281 --> 00:11:42.120 align:middle line:90%
about them.

00:11:42.120 --> 00:11:44.680 align:middle line:84%
And he turns to me, and he
says, there are many lifetimes,

00:11:44.680 --> 00:11:46.030 align:middle line:90%
Bubba.

00:11:46.030 --> 00:11:49.000 align:middle line:84%
This lifetime's
the most important.

00:11:49.000 --> 00:11:51.410 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: And what did that
mean to you in that moment?

00:11:51.410 --> 00:11:53.470 align:middle line:84%
>> PARKYN: Oh, it
stopped me totally.

00:11:53.470 --> 00:11:56.620 align:middle line:84%
It's like, you know,
get in a program, here.

00:11:56.620 --> 00:11:58.610 align:middle line:90%
This is it.

00:11:58.610 --> 00:11:59.410 align:middle line:90%
This is it.

00:11:59.410 --> 00:12:03.250 align:middle line:84%
It was such a magical thing
he gave me in that moment.

00:12:03.250 --> 00:12:05.920 align:middle line:84%
Because I stopped
looking out for things

00:12:05.920 --> 00:12:07.490 align:middle line:90%
that were irrelevant.

00:12:07.490 --> 00:12:08.740 align:middle line:90%
And I really got on the track.

00:12:08.740 --> 00:12:11.350 align:middle line:90%
And that track took me to Osho.

00:12:11.350 --> 00:12:13.120 align:middle line:84%
I needed to find a
spiritual master.

00:12:13.120 --> 00:12:14.200 align:middle line:90%
Get with it.

00:12:14.200 --> 00:12:19.840 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: And how did you
go from Osho to human design?

00:12:19.840 --> 00:12:21.530 align:middle line:10%
>> PARKYN: Being
around Osho was a very,

00:12:21.530 --> 00:12:23.390 align:middle line:10%
very amazing experience.

00:12:23.390 --> 00:12:25.930 align:middle line:10%
I used to say to people,
a day in his community

00:12:25.930 --> 00:12:27.640 align:middle line:10%
was like three
months anywhere else.

00:12:27.640 --> 00:12:29.560 align:middle line:84%
It was so many
things that happened.

00:12:29.560 --> 00:12:32.200 align:middle line:84%
But while I was there,
I'd had this reading

00:12:32.200 --> 00:12:33.790 align:middle line:90%
with a shadow reader.

00:12:33.790 --> 00:12:36.610 align:middle line:84%
A week later, I met
a psychic palm reader

00:12:36.610 --> 00:12:38.620 align:middle line:84%
who told me a lot
of the same things

00:12:38.620 --> 00:12:40.600 align:middle line:84%
that the shadow
reader had told me.

00:12:40.600 --> 00:12:44.110 align:middle line:84%
And he also insisted on
showing me how to read hands.

00:12:44.110 --> 00:12:46.300 align:middle line:90%
And he said, go practice.

00:12:46.300 --> 00:12:48.120 align:middle line:84%
So I started practicing
reading hands.

00:12:48.120 --> 00:12:49.780 align:middle line:84%
The shadow reader
told me, there's

00:12:49.780 --> 00:12:51.590 align:middle line:84%
a system going to
come into your life.

00:12:51.590 --> 00:12:52.840 align:middle line:84%
You're going to
write books about it.

00:12:52.840 --> 00:12:55.256 align:middle line:84%
You're going to introduce it
to people all over the world.

00:12:55.256 --> 00:12:56.965 align:middle line:84%
I was a retiring bus
driver at that time.

00:12:56.965 --> 00:12:57.764 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Right.

00:12:57.764 --> 00:12:58.766 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHING]

00:12:58.766 --> 00:12:59.566 align:middle line:90%


00:12:59.566 --> 00:13:03.190 align:middle line:84%
>> PARKYN: And you know,
this was a fantastic story.

00:13:03.190 --> 00:13:06.940 align:middle line:84%
But the palm reader gave me
a tool to start reading with.

00:13:06.940 --> 00:13:08.440 align:middle line:90%
And so I started with hands.

00:13:08.440 --> 00:13:12.730 align:middle line:84%
I read cards, I read faces, tea
leaves, coffee grinds, auras,

00:13:12.730 --> 00:13:14.770 align:middle line:90%
astrology, everything.

00:13:14.770 --> 00:13:18.090 align:middle line:84%
And then, sure enough, in
1993, I'd been practicing.

00:13:18.090 --> 00:13:21.490 align:middle line:84%
I was-- actually my livelihood
then was reading for people.

00:13:21.490 --> 00:13:24.646 align:middle line:84%
And in 1993, I was sent
my human design chart.

00:13:24.646 --> 00:13:26.020 align:middle line:84%
I took one look
at it, and I knew

00:13:26.020 --> 00:13:27.550 align:middle line:84%
this was what the shadow
reader talked about.

00:13:27.550 --> 00:13:28.600 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Yeah.

00:13:28.600 --> 00:13:30.130 align:middle line:84%
And I want to ask
both of you this.

00:13:30.130 --> 00:13:31.932 align:middle line:84%
Oh, I'm sorry,
finish that thought,

00:13:31.932 --> 00:13:33.140 align:middle line:90%
and then we'll go from there.

00:13:33.140 --> 00:13:34.810 align:middle line:84%
>> PARKYN: Well, the shadow
reader had told me all about

00:13:34.810 --> 00:13:35.690 align:middle line:90%
the books.

00:13:35.690 --> 00:13:38.050 align:middle line:84%
The first book was
30 years later.

00:13:38.050 --> 00:13:41.200 align:middle line:10%
HarperCollins took the book
and now it's in 12 languages.

00:13:41.200 --> 00:13:42.619 align:middle line:10%
It's a best seller in Russia.

00:13:42.619 --> 00:13:43.910 align:middle line:10%
>> REGINA: Yeah, and wonderful.

00:13:43.910 --> 00:13:44.470 align:middle line:90%
>> PARKYN: Wonderful.

00:13:44.470 --> 00:13:45.430 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Wonderful, yes.

00:13:45.430 --> 00:13:46.730 align:middle line:84%
>> PARKYN: It's got
a life of its own.

00:13:46.730 --> 00:13:47.770 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: It does.

00:13:47.770 --> 00:13:50.890 align:middle line:84%
And the thing is, I knew
a lot of Osho people

00:13:50.890 --> 00:13:52.000 align:middle line:90%
when I lived in Sedona.

00:13:52.000 --> 00:13:53.140 align:middle line:90%
And I was never an Osho.

00:13:53.140 --> 00:13:57.220 align:middle line:84%
But I so appreciated the kind
of characteristics and spirit

00:13:57.220 --> 00:13:59.950 align:middle line:84%
of the Osho community, and
read some of Osho's work.

00:13:59.950 --> 00:14:01.210 align:middle line:90%
What an amazing character.

00:14:01.210 --> 00:14:04.150 align:middle line:10%
And yet, most people just
think of the Rolls-Royces

00:14:04.150 --> 00:14:06.050 align:middle line:10%
driving down the road.

00:14:06.050 --> 00:14:08.290 align:middle line:10%
And so, I would
suggest that people

00:14:08.290 --> 00:14:11.870 align:middle line:10%
who don't understand what
the Osho mystique was about,

00:14:11.870 --> 00:14:14.230 align:middle line:10%
look into it a little
further than Rolls-Royces,

00:14:14.230 --> 00:14:18.070 align:middle line:10%
which was essentially a
joke to humanity, anyway.

00:14:18.070 --> 00:14:19.695 align:middle line:84%
>> EASTWOOD: To
America, in particular.

00:14:19.695 --> 00:14:21.195 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: To America
in particular,

00:14:21.195 --> 00:14:23.060 align:middle line:90%
it was one of these.

00:14:23.060 --> 00:14:25.870 align:middle line:84%
So let's talk about
human design itself.

00:14:25.870 --> 00:14:27.775 align:middle line:84%
Because some people
would say, well, I've

00:14:27.775 --> 00:14:28.691 align:middle line:90%
been to my astrologer.

00:14:28.691 --> 00:14:32.890 align:middle line:84%
My astrologer said-- and you can
have wonderful work coming out

00:14:32.890 --> 00:14:34.490 align:middle line:90%
of astrology--

00:14:34.490 --> 00:14:38.360 align:middle line:84%
that I would be best
inclined toward this path.

00:14:38.360 --> 00:14:42.790 align:middle line:84%
What is the difference in your
opinions between astrology

00:14:42.790 --> 00:14:45.700 align:middle line:84%
and other kind of divination
systems and human design?

00:14:45.700 --> 00:14:48.160 align:middle line:84%
>> EASTWOOD: Well, I've been
an astrologer for 30 years--

00:14:48.160 --> 00:14:49.990 align:middle line:90%
professional astrologer.

00:14:49.990 --> 00:14:51.430 align:middle line:90%
And so I know the system.

00:14:51.430 --> 00:14:54.400 align:middle line:84%
I really have mastery
with astrology.

00:14:54.400 --> 00:14:55.900 align:middle line:90%
And I know it so very well.

00:14:55.900 --> 00:15:00.850 align:middle line:84%
Human design came into my
life about 20 years ago.

00:15:00.850 --> 00:15:04.307 align:middle line:84%
And I also have gone very
deep with human design.

00:15:04.307 --> 00:15:06.640 align:middle line:84%
So I think I'm a good person
to compare the two systems.

00:15:06.640 --> 00:15:08.620 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Yes, absolutely.

00:15:08.620 --> 00:15:10.346 align:middle line:84%
>> EASTWOOD: They
do different things.

00:15:10.346 --> 00:15:11.470 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Give us an idea.

00:15:11.470 --> 00:15:13.200 align:middle line:84%
>> EASTWOOD: Well,
so, astrology--

00:15:13.200 --> 00:15:16.090 align:middle line:84%
as I'm sure you know-- it
shows us the inner workings

00:15:16.090 --> 00:15:21.400 align:middle line:84%
of our psyche, our strengths,
our talents, our abilities.

00:15:21.400 --> 00:15:23.580 align:middle line:84%
It gives us
opportunities, cycles.

00:15:23.580 --> 00:15:25.930 align:middle line:84%
It shows us when challenges
might be coming up,

00:15:25.930 --> 00:15:27.210 align:middle line:90%
what those are.

00:15:27.210 --> 00:15:28.960 align:middle line:84%
Actually, it shows us
how to resolve them,

00:15:28.960 --> 00:15:31.330 align:middle line:84%
if you know how to
read it that way.

00:15:31.330 --> 00:15:34.370 align:middle line:90%
It's a wonderful tool.

00:15:34.370 --> 00:15:38.300 align:middle line:10%
Human design is a
self-empowerment tool.

00:15:38.300 --> 00:15:41.870 align:middle line:10%
It's the first Aquarian system.

00:15:41.870 --> 00:15:44.480 align:middle line:10%
And the difference
between it and any system

00:15:44.480 --> 00:15:47.510 align:middle line:10%
even like astrology,
is that it maps

00:15:47.510 --> 00:15:50.930 align:middle line:10%
not only the conscious self,
but the unconscious as well--

00:15:50.930 --> 00:15:53.120 align:middle line:10%
what you've inherited
down several generations,

00:15:53.120 --> 00:15:55.890 align:middle line:10%
or you could say what's
come in from past lives.

00:15:55.890 --> 00:15:58.880 align:middle line:84%
So we have this whole
plethora of information

00:15:58.880 --> 00:16:03.320 align:middle line:84%
that is not available in
astrology through human design.

00:16:03.320 --> 00:16:05.990 align:middle line:84%
And the other big
distinction I would make

00:16:05.990 --> 00:16:10.280 align:middle line:84%
is that human design is
about a path for living,

00:16:10.280 --> 00:16:15.500 align:middle line:84%
a way of living our lives in
which we're no longer really

00:16:15.500 --> 00:16:18.350 align:middle line:84%
dependent on going to
the astrologer to tell us

00:16:18.350 --> 00:16:21.200 align:middle line:84%
what's coming up or what might
be possible, because we have

00:16:21.200 --> 00:16:26.900 align:middle line:84%
a way of having found our own
internal compass, if you will.

00:16:26.900 --> 00:16:30.710 align:middle line:84%
We have a way to orchestrate
our life that is always

00:16:30.710 --> 00:16:33.170 align:middle line:84%
going to be in alignment
with our higher self,

00:16:33.170 --> 00:16:34.955 align:middle line:84%
with our truth, and
with our path in life.

00:16:34.955 --> 00:16:36.455 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: That's
a good definition.

00:16:36.455 --> 00:16:37.850 align:middle line:84%
>> EASTWOOD: It's a
wonderful empowerment system.

00:16:37.850 --> 00:16:38.650 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Yeah.

00:16:38.650 --> 00:16:41.929 align:middle line:84%
I mean, when I was first exposed
to it, maybe around 2000,

00:16:41.929 --> 00:16:43.220 align:middle line:90%
that's what I noticed about it.

00:16:43.220 --> 00:16:46.640 align:middle line:84%
I thought, this seems to be
oddly kind of specific also

00:16:46.640 --> 00:16:48.425 align:middle line:90%
to one's way of functioning.

00:16:48.425 --> 00:16:50.630 align:middle line:84%
And when one doesn't
function that way, kind

00:16:50.630 --> 00:16:54.590 align:middle line:84%
of the suffering that happens
as a result. And I think maybe

00:16:54.590 --> 00:16:56.129 align:middle line:84%
we won't go deeply
into it because I

00:16:56.129 --> 00:16:57.920 align:middle line:84%
would encourage people
to go back and watch

00:16:57.920 --> 00:16:59.190 align:middle line:90%
our first interview.

00:16:59.190 --> 00:17:03.689 align:middle line:84%
But a little bit
into the basic types,

00:17:03.689 --> 00:17:05.230 align:middle line:84%
so we get an idea
of what that means,

00:17:05.230 --> 00:17:07.490 align:middle line:84%
where when you're not
behaving in a way that's

00:17:07.490 --> 00:17:10.130 align:middle line:84%
consistent with who you
are, you do suffer--

00:17:10.130 --> 00:17:11.460 align:middle line:90%
such as projectors.

00:17:11.460 --> 00:17:13.060 align:middle line:90%
But anyway, let's go ahead.

00:17:13.060 --> 00:17:15.930 align:middle line:84%
And so, we have two projectors
and a generator at the table.

00:17:15.930 --> 00:17:18.050 align:middle line:84%
So let's talk about
these basic types.

00:17:18.050 --> 00:17:20.700 align:middle line:84%
>> PARKYN: So you and
I, Regina, we're odd,

00:17:20.700 --> 00:17:22.210 align:middle line:90%
because we are these projects.

00:17:22.210 --> 00:17:24.319 align:middle line:90%
We're the old ones out.

00:17:24.319 --> 00:17:28.319 align:middle line:84%
Mostly, we're surrounded by
people we call energy types.

00:17:28.319 --> 00:17:30.430 align:middle line:84%
These are generators,
manifesting generators,

00:17:30.430 --> 00:17:31.230 align:middle line:90%
and manifestors--

00:17:31.230 --> 00:17:32.370 align:middle line:90%
80%.

00:17:32.370 --> 00:17:35.270 align:middle line:84%
We're the 20%, and there's
even one more bracket,

00:17:35.270 --> 00:17:36.420 align:middle line:90%
the reflectors--

00:17:36.420 --> 00:17:38.630 align:middle line:90%
those most precious people--

00:17:38.630 --> 00:17:41.270 align:middle line:84%
less than 1% of the
world's population.

00:17:41.270 --> 00:17:44.310 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: And just give us a
little kind of portrait of what

00:17:44.310 --> 00:17:45.110 align:middle line:90%
they're like.

00:17:45.110 --> 00:17:48.550 align:middle line:90%
I've only ever known one.

00:17:48.550 --> 00:17:51.020 align:middle line:84%
>> PARKYN: The designs I've
talked about, the types--

00:17:51.020 --> 00:17:53.600 align:middle line:84%
except for the reflectors,
we're all solar types.

00:17:53.600 --> 00:17:56.180 align:middle line:90%
We're radiating energy out.

00:17:56.180 --> 00:18:01.120 align:middle line:84%
Reflectors are absorbing
and reflecting.

00:18:01.120 --> 00:18:04.750 align:middle line:84%
So they're in a position
where literally everything

00:18:04.750 --> 00:18:06.890 align:middle line:84%
around them is going to
affect them very deeply.

00:18:06.890 --> 00:18:07.690 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Yes.

00:18:07.690 --> 00:18:09.815 align:middle line:84%
>> PARKYN: They have to be
very, very careful about

00:18:09.815 --> 00:18:11.320 align:middle line:90%
their environments.

00:18:11.320 --> 00:18:15.020 align:middle line:84%
For us, it's like going out
into a garden in the sunshine.

00:18:15.020 --> 00:18:17.400 align:middle line:84%
The plants are this color,
the birds are singing,

00:18:17.400 --> 00:18:19.380 align:middle line:84%
the fragrance in the
air is like this.

00:18:19.380 --> 00:18:22.490 align:middle line:84%
If we're barefoot, we're
feeling the grass underneath us.

00:18:22.490 --> 00:18:24.570 align:middle line:84%
For a reflector,
it's like going out

00:18:24.570 --> 00:18:28.070 align:middle line:84%
into that same garden
by moonlight, completely

00:18:28.070 --> 00:18:29.000 align:middle line:90%
different.

00:18:29.000 --> 00:18:31.455 align:middle line:84%
Same garden, but just
the whole circumstance

00:18:31.455 --> 00:18:32.430 align:middle line:90%
is complete different.

00:18:32.430 --> 00:18:34.070 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: So they're
super sensitive,

00:18:34.070 --> 00:18:36.975 align:middle line:84%
they end up almost
mirroring you back to you

00:18:36.975 --> 00:18:39.350 align:middle line:84%
because they're just reflecting
everything that they come

00:18:39.350 --> 00:18:40.450 align:middle line:90%
in contact with, right?

00:18:40.450 --> 00:18:41.450 align:middle line:90%
>> PARKYN: Exactly this.

00:18:41.450 --> 00:18:43.310 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: So there's
no real sense of self.

00:18:43.310 --> 00:18:46.670 align:middle line:84%
It can be very hard to
define your purpose in such

00:18:46.670 --> 00:18:48.680 align:middle line:90%
as a reflector, I would assume.

00:18:48.680 --> 00:18:50.722 align:middle line:84%
>> PARKYN: Their self is
as big as this universe.

00:18:50.722 --> 00:18:52.221 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: Yeah,
that's why I asked.

00:18:52.221 --> 00:18:54.470 align:middle line:84%
I'm just starting with
the most rare and peculiar

00:18:54.470 --> 00:18:57.320 align:middle line:84%
of these birds because
how in the world

00:18:57.320 --> 00:18:59.150 align:middle line:84%
can you even work
with a reflector

00:18:59.150 --> 00:19:03.285 align:middle line:84%
to find their destiny, when
there's nothing on their chart?

00:19:03.285 --> 00:19:04.660 align:middle line:84%
>> PARKYN: You
are very watchful.

00:19:04.660 --> 00:19:08.800 align:middle line:84%
We've come across some
extraordinarily wise reflectors

00:19:08.800 --> 00:19:10.540 align:middle line:84%
because they give
themselves time

00:19:10.540 --> 00:19:13.570 align:middle line:84%
to recognize what it is
that's beneficial for them

00:19:13.570 --> 00:19:16.960 align:middle line:84%
and what's not, who makes
for good company, who

00:19:16.960 --> 00:19:19.060 align:middle line:90%
recognizes their great gifts.

00:19:19.060 --> 00:19:21.970 align:middle line:84%
I have to say, I've met some
of the most intelligent people

00:19:21.970 --> 00:19:23.395 align:middle line:90%
ever who are reflectors.

00:19:23.395 --> 00:19:25.561 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: Well, I guess
you would almost have to be

00:19:25.561 --> 00:19:28.810 align:middle line:84%
to choose to incarnate that
way to be so open to all,

00:19:28.810 --> 00:19:30.835 align:middle line:84%
to be such a reflection
for all of humanity.

00:19:30.835 --> 00:19:31.400 align:middle line:90%
>> EASTWOOD: Very brave.

00:19:31.400 --> 00:19:32.441 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Yeah, exactly.

00:19:32.441 --> 00:19:34.690 align:middle line:84%
>> EASTWOOD: But they
have a destiny path,

00:19:34.690 --> 00:19:36.900 align:middle line:90%
a purpose for the life.

00:19:36.900 --> 00:19:40.960 align:middle line:84%
The reflector nature is
the way they have chosen

00:19:40.960 --> 00:19:43.060 align:middle line:90%
to live out that destiny.

00:19:43.060 --> 00:19:44.140 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Yeah.

00:19:44.140 --> 00:19:48.130 align:middle line:84%
The one I knew was an amazingly
intelligent and talented human

00:19:48.130 --> 00:19:50.740 align:middle line:84%
being but really oftentimes,
would get pulled off

00:19:50.740 --> 00:19:53.020 align:middle line:84%
by this philosophy,
that one, and just

00:19:53.020 --> 00:19:55.210 align:middle line:84%
kind of wobbling all
over the place trying

00:19:55.210 --> 00:19:56.920 align:middle line:90%
to find their home.

00:19:56.920 --> 00:19:57.730 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:19:57.730 --> 00:20:00.550 align:middle line:84%
OK, so now let's go
to the preponderance

00:20:00.550 --> 00:20:02.631 align:middle line:90%
of the types, the energy types.

00:20:02.631 --> 00:20:04.630 align:middle line:84%
>> PARKYN: Well, let's
start with the projector,

00:20:04.630 --> 00:20:06.790 align:middle line:84%
since you and I are
both projectors.

00:20:06.790 --> 00:20:09.550 align:middle line:84%
We have to know our designs
better than everybody.

00:20:09.550 --> 00:20:11.800 align:middle line:84%
Because the word
projector basically means

00:20:11.800 --> 00:20:16.960 align:middle line:84%
we project out a certain
kind of energy of our design.

00:20:16.960 --> 00:20:20.410 align:middle line:84%
And every projector has
a very singular design.

00:20:20.410 --> 00:20:25.026 align:middle line:84%
So we project out this energy,
and people will pick up on it.

00:20:25.026 --> 00:20:26.650 align:middle line:84%
And they'll recognize
there's something

00:20:26.650 --> 00:20:30.425 align:middle line:84%
different about this person,
they're not part of the 80%.

00:20:30.425 --> 00:20:31.800 align:middle line:84%
And that's our
great thing, is we

00:20:31.800 --> 00:20:34.560 align:middle line:84%
have to recognize we are
not here to get caught up

00:20:34.560 --> 00:20:35.880 align:middle line:90%
in everybody else's stuff.

00:20:35.880 --> 00:20:39.180 align:middle line:84%
We have to know exactly what
our design, our nature is,

00:20:39.180 --> 00:20:41.010 align:middle line:84%
and who it is that's
being attracted

00:20:41.010 --> 00:20:44.280 align:middle line:84%
to us, who it is that's offering
us things to get involved

00:20:44.280 --> 00:20:45.360 align:middle line:90%
with in our lives.

00:20:45.360 --> 00:20:47.670 align:middle line:90%
Because basically, what guides--

00:20:47.670 --> 00:20:48.600 align:middle line:90%
we're here to guide.

00:20:48.600 --> 00:20:51.060 align:middle line:84%
The clearer we can be in our
design, the better guidance

00:20:51.060 --> 00:20:53.390 align:middle line:90%
we give.

00:20:53.390 --> 00:20:55.940 align:middle line:84%
The other types, the
generators, Carola

00:20:55.940 --> 00:20:59.510 align:middle line:84%
is a generator-- tons
of life force energy.

00:20:59.510 --> 00:21:02.454 align:middle line:84%
Don't ever try and interrupt
the generator in mid-stride.

00:21:02.454 --> 00:21:03.620 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Boy, that's true.

00:21:03.620 --> 00:21:05.120 align:middle line:90%
That is true.

00:21:05.120 --> 00:21:08.930 align:middle line:84%
There's a lot of momentum there,
but enough energy to spill over

00:21:08.930 --> 00:21:11.970 align:middle line:90%
and will fuel us at this table.

00:21:11.970 --> 00:21:13.230 align:middle line:90%
>> PARKYN: Don't we feel it?

00:21:13.230 --> 00:21:13.650 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Yes.

00:21:13.650 --> 00:21:14.480 align:middle line:90%
>> PARKYN: Yeah.

00:21:14.480 --> 00:21:18.660 align:middle line:84%
So generators have this
ability to respond to life.

00:21:18.660 --> 00:21:21.740 align:middle line:84%
And it's what we call an
energetic gut response.

00:21:21.740 --> 00:21:24.140 align:middle line:84%
So lower belly, nothing
to do with up here.

00:21:24.140 --> 00:21:27.110 align:middle line:84%
It's an energetic response
to whatever life places

00:21:27.110 --> 00:21:29.300 align:middle line:84%
before them, or whatever
it is they perceive

00:21:29.300 --> 00:21:31.670 align:middle line:84%
for themself inside
themself that something

00:21:31.670 --> 00:21:32.740 align:middle line:90%
catches their attention.

00:21:32.740 --> 00:21:35.180 align:middle line:84%
They want to put
energy towards it.

00:21:35.180 --> 00:21:39.200 align:middle line:84%
Manifestors, 11% of
the world's population.

00:21:39.200 --> 00:21:42.830 align:middle line:90%
They have this catalytic energy.

00:21:42.830 --> 00:21:45.320 align:middle line:90%
Wherever they go, things happen.

00:21:45.320 --> 00:21:47.760 align:middle line:84%
They, themselves, are
happening, in a sense.

00:21:47.760 --> 00:21:48.560 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Oh, boy.

00:21:48.560 --> 00:21:50.450 align:middle line:84%
I have a lot of female
generator friends,

00:21:50.450 --> 00:21:52.820 align:middle line:84%
disproportionate
to the population.

00:21:52.820 --> 00:21:54.050 align:middle line:90%
They're a handful.

00:21:54.050 --> 00:21:55.690 align:middle line:90%
>> PARKYN: Well, yes, yes.

00:21:55.690 --> 00:21:57.450 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHING]

00:21:57.450 --> 00:21:58.910 align:middle line:90%
>> EASTWOOD: --as you know.

00:21:58.910 --> 00:22:00.480 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: They
make things happen.

00:22:00.480 --> 00:22:01.190 align:middle line:90%
>> PARKYN: Yes, indeed.

00:22:01.190 --> 00:22:01.990 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Yeah.

00:22:01.990 --> 00:22:05.880 align:middle line:84%
>> PARKYN: So, the likes of
us have to be really careful,

00:22:05.880 --> 00:22:07.880 align:middle line:90%
as projectors, who we commit to.

00:22:07.880 --> 00:22:10.310 align:middle line:84%
So manifestors,
they catalyze stuff.

00:22:10.310 --> 00:22:13.430 align:middle line:84%
They have this ability right
from the moment they're born,

00:22:13.430 --> 00:22:15.180 align:middle line:90%
to make things happen.

00:22:15.180 --> 00:22:17.450 align:middle line:84%
So very peaceful couples
can all of a sudden

00:22:17.450 --> 00:22:19.620 align:middle line:84%
find they've got a
manifestor child.

00:22:19.620 --> 00:22:21.770 align:middle line:90%
Everything changes.

00:22:21.770 --> 00:22:24.710 align:middle line:84%
And what happens for the
manifestor is very often,

00:22:24.710 --> 00:22:26.090 align:middle line:90%
they get shut down.

00:22:26.090 --> 00:22:27.060 align:middle line:90%
Why are you doing this?

00:22:27.060 --> 00:22:28.184 align:middle line:90%
Why do you need to do that?

00:22:28.184 --> 00:22:29.701 align:middle line:84%
Just sit down like
the rest of us.

00:22:29.701 --> 00:22:31.200 align:middle line:84%
And that's not part
of their nature.

00:22:31.200 --> 00:22:31.790 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: No.

00:22:31.790 --> 00:22:33.140 align:middle line:84%
>> PARKYN: So they can
get very resentful.

00:22:33.140 --> 00:22:34.550 align:middle line:84%
They can start
using their elbows

00:22:34.550 --> 00:22:36.810 align:middle line:84%
to get through things, to
find their way through.

00:22:36.810 --> 00:22:39.620 align:middle line:84%
They can go around
people, avoid everything.

00:22:39.620 --> 00:22:43.160 align:middle line:84%
And what we say to manifestors
is just let the rest of us

00:22:43.160 --> 00:22:45.530 align:middle line:84%
know a little bit
of your intentions.

00:22:45.530 --> 00:22:47.990 align:middle line:84%
And then, all of a sudden,
we'll see if maybe we

00:22:47.990 --> 00:22:49.080 align:middle line:90%
can join in to help.

00:22:49.080 --> 00:22:49.880 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Right.

00:22:49.880 --> 00:22:52.390 align:middle line:84%
>> PARKYN: For every other
type than a reflector

00:22:52.390 --> 00:22:54.830 align:middle line:84%
and a manifestor, I say,
you've got to have at least one

00:22:54.830 --> 00:22:56.390 align:middle line:90%
of these people in your life.

00:22:56.390 --> 00:22:57.890 align:middle line:84%
You've got to have
a reflector, just

00:22:57.890 --> 00:22:59.600 align:middle line:84%
to get a check in every
now and again of what's

00:22:59.600 --> 00:23:00.447 align:middle line:90%
going on for you.

00:23:00.447 --> 00:23:02.780 align:middle line:84%
And a manifestor, if you ever
need to get something done

00:23:02.780 --> 00:23:05.570 align:middle line:84%
and they're agreeable, they
will facilitate for this

00:23:05.570 --> 00:23:06.785 align:middle line:90%
to take place for you.

00:23:06.785 --> 00:23:08.660 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: Yes, and
then, there's that hybrid

00:23:08.660 --> 00:23:10.520 align:middle line:90%
of the manifesting generator.

00:23:10.520 --> 00:23:15.260 align:middle line:84%
>> PARKYN: They are,
really, yes, a hybrid.

00:23:15.260 --> 00:23:18.020 align:middle line:84%
They have the same thing of
getting the gut response,

00:23:18.020 --> 00:23:22.040 align:middle line:84%
energetic response, but they
have to tip-toe into things.

00:23:22.040 --> 00:23:24.080 align:middle line:84%
Because there's that
space between just getting

00:23:24.080 --> 00:23:26.510 align:middle line:84%
that response and
committing like a generator

00:23:26.510 --> 00:23:29.090 align:middle line:84%
will, and getting that
response and turning it

00:23:29.090 --> 00:23:30.770 align:middle line:90%
into manifestation.

00:23:30.770 --> 00:23:32.720 align:middle line:84%
They have to go
through a protocol.

00:23:32.720 --> 00:23:34.820 align:middle line:84%
I call it a protocol
of just checking.

00:23:34.820 --> 00:23:36.800 align:middle line:84%
As they get further and
further towards what

00:23:36.800 --> 00:23:40.040 align:middle line:84%
it is they responded to,
to just keep checking,

00:23:40.040 --> 00:23:41.990 align:middle line:90%
is this working for me?

00:23:41.990 --> 00:23:44.744 align:middle line:84%
And they have what I
call a moment of truth,

00:23:44.744 --> 00:23:46.910 align:middle line:84%
that literally, they can
be preparing and preparing,

00:23:46.910 --> 00:23:49.440 align:middle line:84%
getting all the way
up to a point in time.

00:23:49.440 --> 00:23:52.620 align:middle line:84%
And then just suddenly, they're
either going to commit to it--

00:23:52.620 --> 00:23:55.430 align:middle line:84%
in which case-- become a
manifestor and it's like a red

00:23:55.430 --> 00:23:57.890 align:middle line:84%
carpet just goes right
in front of them--

00:23:57.890 --> 00:24:00.500 align:middle line:84%
or they get this moment
of truth that just says,

00:24:00.500 --> 00:24:01.820 align:middle line:90%
this is not doing it for me.

00:24:01.820 --> 00:24:02.330 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Right.

00:24:02.330 --> 00:24:03.300 align:middle line:90%
>> PARKYN: That's the end of it.

00:24:03.300 --> 00:24:04.310 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: Well,
because as you say,

00:24:04.310 --> 00:24:06.260 align:middle line:84%
this is very much a
gut level response.

00:24:06.260 --> 00:24:11.600 align:middle line:84%
And I have a friend who
became really obsessed

00:24:11.600 --> 00:24:12.560 align:middle line:90%
with human design.

00:24:12.560 --> 00:24:14.280 align:middle line:90%
And he now does some readings.

00:24:14.280 --> 00:24:17.320 align:middle line:90%
He's living in Ibiza.

00:24:17.320 --> 00:24:19.670 align:middle line:84%
But going through the
beginning stage of it,

00:24:19.670 --> 00:24:21.660 align:middle line:84%
he had kind of a childlike
quality about him.

00:24:21.660 --> 00:24:23.870 align:middle line:84%
So he said, OK, so
ask me if I want

00:24:23.870 --> 00:24:25.190 align:middle line:90%
to have granola for breakfast.

00:24:25.190 --> 00:24:26.190 align:middle line:90%
It's like, oh, god.

00:24:26.190 --> 00:24:28.550 align:middle line:84%
Please, do we have
to do this again?

00:24:28.550 --> 00:24:32.060 align:middle line:84%
Because he was going through the
uh-huh, uh-huh phase, you know?

00:24:32.060 --> 00:24:36.110 align:middle line:84%
Which, again, explain what this
uh-huh, uh-uh really means.

00:24:36.110 --> 00:24:37.910 align:middle line:84%
And please, people,
don't do this.

00:24:37.910 --> 00:24:39.894 align:middle line:84%
It's so annoying to
those around you.

00:24:39.894 --> 00:24:41.310 align:middle line:84%
>> PARKYN: I agree
with you there.

00:24:41.310 --> 00:24:44.285 align:middle line:90%
But It's an energetic response.

00:24:44.285 --> 00:24:46.460 align:middle line:84%
>> EASTWOOD: I can
be a silent thing.

00:24:46.460 --> 00:24:50.220 align:middle line:84%
It's a sense of ones energy,
a generator's energy,

00:24:50.220 --> 00:24:54.080 align:middle line:84%
or manifesting generator's
energy rising toward something,

00:24:54.080 --> 00:24:56.140 align:middle line:90%
opening towards it.

00:24:56.140 --> 00:24:59.100 align:middle line:84%
And if the gut were
to make a noise,

00:24:59.100 --> 00:25:01.850 align:middle line:90%
it would sound like that uh-huh.

00:25:01.850 --> 00:25:04.945 align:middle line:84%
But you know, it doesn't need
to be expressed verbally.

00:25:04.945 --> 00:25:07.250 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: I thought that
was slightly self-indulgent,

00:25:07.250 --> 00:25:09.650 align:middle line:84%
wanting everyone to pay
attention to them all day.

00:25:09.650 --> 00:25:11.816 align:middle line:84%
Are you sure you wouldn't
like to go see this movie?

00:25:11.816 --> 00:25:12.920 align:middle line:90%
Uh-uh.

00:25:12.920 --> 00:25:14.420 align:middle line:90%
It's like, OK.

00:25:14.420 --> 00:25:16.670 align:middle line:84%
>> EASTWOOD: Well, he was
probably just learning about

00:25:16.670 --> 00:25:17.470 align:middle line:90%
it.

00:25:17.470 --> 00:25:19.370 align:middle line:84%
Because we have so many
years of conditioning

00:25:19.370 --> 00:25:21.860 align:middle line:84%
to move a certain way in
life, live a certain way,

00:25:21.860 --> 00:25:24.260 align:middle line:84%
make decisions a certain
way, that when we first

00:25:24.260 --> 00:25:26.747 align:middle line:84%
get this information,
it's a little bit like,

00:25:26.747 --> 00:25:28.330 align:middle line:84%
well, you kind of
have to practice it,

00:25:28.330 --> 00:25:30.380 align:middle line:84%
and you kind of
have to try it on.

00:25:30.380 --> 00:25:33.940 align:middle line:84%
And then you get the experience
of it working for you.

00:25:33.940 --> 00:25:36.424 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: Well, I would think
that it is very freeing too.

00:25:36.424 --> 00:25:37.340 align:middle line:90%
It's like, oh, my god.

00:25:37.340 --> 00:25:41.120 align:middle line:84%
I just have to listen to my
little internal quiet inside

00:25:41.120 --> 00:25:43.400 align:middle line:84%
voice of uh-huh
and uh-uh, right?

00:25:43.400 --> 00:25:44.780 align:middle line:84%
And I can see
where that would be

00:25:44.780 --> 00:25:46.880 align:middle line:84%
quite liberating
for a person to know

00:25:46.880 --> 00:25:50.350 align:middle line:84%
it can be that simple,
instead of trying to conform.

00:25:50.350 --> 00:25:51.470 align:middle line:90%
And this is the big deal.

00:25:51.470 --> 00:25:55.070 align:middle line:84%
In most societies,
societal structures,

00:25:55.070 --> 00:25:58.100 align:middle line:84%
institutional structures
are not looking for people

00:25:58.100 --> 00:26:01.880 align:middle line:84%
to find their true voice,
their passion, and their path--

00:26:01.880 --> 00:26:03.830 align:middle line:90%
quite the opposite, right?

00:26:03.830 --> 00:26:05.900 align:middle line:84%
It's structured towards
shutting us down

00:26:05.900 --> 00:26:10.129 align:middle line:84%
into a compliant society that's
functional for its needs.

00:26:10.129 --> 00:26:11.420 align:middle line:90%
>> EASTWOOD: Yeah, worker bees.

00:26:11.420 --> 00:26:12.378 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Worker bees.

00:26:12.378 --> 00:26:14.090 align:middle line:84%
And that is how
it's all structured.

00:26:14.090 --> 00:26:17.420 align:middle line:84%
Doesn't matter really
what the institution is

00:26:17.420 --> 00:26:19.290 align:middle line:84%
or what the religion
is, or so forth.

00:26:19.290 --> 00:26:22.880 align:middle line:84%
It all kind of boils down to
having a compliant following.

00:26:22.880 --> 00:26:25.360 align:middle line:84%
So let's talk about
that, that Ra.

00:26:25.360 --> 00:26:27.980 align:middle line:84%
Let's talk about how he
overcame this and came up

00:26:27.980 --> 00:26:30.240 align:middle line:90%
with this whole system himself.

00:26:30.240 --> 00:26:31.210 align:middle line:10%
That was crazy.

00:26:31.210 --> 00:26:32.918 align:middle line:10%
>> PARKYN: Well, he
was given the system.

00:26:32.918 --> 00:26:34.250 align:middle line:10%
He was given a download.

00:26:34.250 --> 00:26:37.280 align:middle line:84%
He honestly did not know
what he'd been given,

00:26:37.280 --> 00:26:39.590 align:middle line:84%
didn't come with an
instruction book.

00:26:39.590 --> 00:26:42.440 align:middle line:84%
And so over the years,
it was all worked out.

00:26:42.440 --> 00:26:44.420 align:middle line:90%
And he would basically find out.

00:26:44.420 --> 00:26:46.550 align:middle line:84%
He would say stuff
and find out what

00:26:46.550 --> 00:26:48.230 align:middle line:90%
people would come back with.

00:26:48.230 --> 00:26:50.180 align:middle line:84%
And from that, he started
seeing, yes, there

00:26:50.180 --> 00:26:52.970 align:middle line:84%
are certain patterns
within all this.

00:26:52.970 --> 00:26:55.670 align:middle line:84%
So, yeah, this system
is a revolution.

00:26:55.670 --> 00:26:58.490 align:middle line:84%
It basically gives us
all that opportunity

00:26:58.490 --> 00:27:02.120 align:middle line:84%
to find out who we are in our
own nature, what we came here

00:27:02.120 --> 00:27:03.830 align:middle line:90%
for, you know?

00:27:03.830 --> 00:27:05.740 align:middle line:84%
It really is, it
comes down to that.

00:27:05.740 --> 00:27:08.390 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: The question society
doesn't want you to ask,

00:27:08.390 --> 00:27:11.690 align:middle line:84%
institutions at large
don't want you to ask.

00:27:11.690 --> 00:27:13.520 align:middle line:84%
>> PARKYN: Who knows
what society is?

00:27:13.520 --> 00:27:13.970 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Exactly.

00:27:13.970 --> 00:27:16.490 align:middle line:84%
>> PARKYN: You know, society is
fumbling along with a blindfold

00:27:16.490 --> 00:27:17.290 align:middle line:90%
on.

00:27:17.290 --> 00:27:19.880 align:middle line:90%
Hence, we have climate disaster.

00:27:19.880 --> 00:27:23.800 align:middle line:84%
I'm not even calling it climate
change, it's climate disaster.

00:27:23.800 --> 00:27:25.180 align:middle line:84%
All around us
here, they're still

00:27:25.180 --> 00:27:28.390 align:middle line:84%
drilling holes in the ground
to frack oil in the ground,

00:27:28.390 --> 00:27:29.390 align:middle line:90%
if you please.

00:27:29.390 --> 00:27:30.190 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Right.

00:27:30.190 --> 00:27:33.127 align:middle line:84%
>> PARKYN: And we don't
need this stuff anymore.

00:27:33.127 --> 00:27:34.210 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Right, exactly.

00:27:34.210 --> 00:27:35.510 align:middle line:84%
>> PARKYN: And people
still have guns.

00:27:35.510 --> 00:27:36.926 align:middle line:84%
I mean, what are
these things for?

00:27:36.926 --> 00:27:39.590 align:middle line:84%
There are three
disasters for humanity--

00:27:39.590 --> 00:27:43.810 align:middle line:84%
there is the disaster of
war, the disaster of hunger,

00:27:43.810 --> 00:27:45.810 align:middle line:90%
and the disaster of disease.

00:27:45.810 --> 00:27:48.730 align:middle line:84%
In the 21st century, we do
not need this stuff anymore.

00:27:48.730 --> 00:27:52.189 align:middle line:84%
>> EASTWOOD: All of which
could be cured quickly with

00:27:52.189 --> 00:27:53.230 align:middle line:90%
consciousness, awareness.

00:27:53.230 --> 00:27:54.740 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Absolutely.

00:27:54.740 --> 00:27:58.150 align:middle line:84%
And if people were
living their true path,

00:27:58.150 --> 00:28:00.250 align:middle line:84%
then we wouldn't have
the anxiety, frustration,

00:28:00.250 --> 00:28:03.062 align:middle line:84%
need to compete and
conquer and so forth.

00:28:03.062 --> 00:28:05.520 align:middle line:84%
You could argue that we would
have evolved to a point where

00:28:05.520 --> 00:28:07.460 align:middle line:90%
that was no longer necessary.

00:28:07.460 --> 00:28:09.080 align:middle line:90%
Let me ask something briefly.

00:28:09.080 --> 00:28:12.880 align:middle line:84%
How often do you read children,
read the charts of children

00:28:12.880 --> 00:28:15.950 align:middle line:84%
for people so they can have
better understanding of guiding

00:28:15.950 --> 00:28:16.750 align:middle line:90%
their children?

00:28:16.750 --> 00:28:19.787 align:middle line:84%
Because that seems, to me, to be
the real holy grail right now.

00:28:19.787 --> 00:28:21.120 align:middle line:90%
>> PARKYN: As often as possible.

00:28:21.120 --> 00:28:22.960 align:middle line:84%
>> EASTWOOD: Right,
as much as we can.

00:28:22.960 --> 00:28:26.950 align:middle line:84%
Because when parents can
understand this and change

00:28:26.950 --> 00:28:29.620 align:middle line:84%
the way they relate to their
child in the simplest ways,

00:28:29.620 --> 00:28:33.250 align:middle line:84%
by honoring their nature,
then what we're doing really

00:28:33.250 --> 00:28:37.290 align:middle line:84%
is preventing the
further conditioning

00:28:37.290 --> 00:28:39.950 align:middle line:84%
that happens in childhood by
well-meaning parents, often.

00:28:39.950 --> 00:28:40.750 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Sure.

00:28:40.750 --> 00:28:42.700 align:middle line:84%
>> EASTWOOD: You know,
they just don't know.

00:28:42.700 --> 00:28:46.510 align:middle line:84%
But it's taking those
children so far off path.

00:28:46.510 --> 00:28:48.520 align:middle line:84%
And then, you
know, I started out

00:28:48.520 --> 00:28:50.380 align:middle line:90%
doing counseling and astrology.

00:28:50.380 --> 00:28:55.180 align:middle line:84%
And I would have people in
my office in so much pain

00:28:55.180 --> 00:28:59.770 align:middle line:84%
because they had married the
wrong person and had children.

00:28:59.770 --> 00:29:02.890 align:middle line:84%
And they were in agony over
a really tough decision.

00:29:02.890 --> 00:29:06.370 align:middle line:84%
Or they had chosen
the wrong path, spent

00:29:06.370 --> 00:29:10.720 align:middle line:84%
seven years in college because
their dad thought they should,

00:29:10.720 --> 00:29:15.430 align:middle line:84%
and they're miserable,
miserable for a decade or more.

00:29:15.430 --> 00:29:16.840 align:middle line:84%
And it's because
they didn't know

00:29:16.840 --> 00:29:19.850 align:middle line:84%
how to listen to their
own truth, how to find it.

00:29:19.850 --> 00:29:20.650 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Right.

00:29:20.650 --> 00:29:22.720 align:middle line:84%
And so, if we can start
with children and helping

00:29:22.720 --> 00:29:26.500 align:middle line:84%
our children move toward their
natural propensity of what

00:29:26.500 --> 00:29:30.890 align:middle line:84%
they're here for, the resistance
isn't there from the beginning.

00:29:30.890 --> 00:29:32.470 align:middle line:90%
>> EASTWOOD: Exactly.

00:29:32.470 --> 00:29:33.620 align:middle line:90%
>> PARKYN: Yes.

00:29:33.620 --> 00:29:36.460 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: OK, so,
there's another thing.

00:29:36.460 --> 00:29:38.710 align:middle line:84%
A lot of times, when
people go into this

00:29:38.710 --> 00:29:40.960 align:middle line:90%
and say, oh, my life's purpose--

00:29:40.960 --> 00:29:45.190 align:middle line:84%
oftentimes, people, because
of our habitual thinking

00:29:45.190 --> 00:29:49.090 align:middle line:84%
in the west, in particular,
try to align purpose

00:29:49.090 --> 00:29:55.000 align:middle line:84%
with a career, monetary
sourcing, and monetization

00:29:55.000 --> 00:29:56.720 align:middle line:90%
in general.

00:29:56.720 --> 00:30:00.400 align:middle line:84%
And I think that really has
caused some problems for people

00:30:00.400 --> 00:30:02.950 align:middle line:84%
because they can't see
themselves as something larger

00:30:02.950 --> 00:30:04.537 align:middle line:90%
than just a career path.

00:30:04.537 --> 00:30:06.370 align:middle line:84%
Because everyone wants
to think your destiny

00:30:06.370 --> 00:30:09.020 align:middle line:84%
is how you're going to
kind of make your living.

00:30:09.020 --> 00:30:11.800 align:middle line:84%
And that is not
necessarily so at all.

00:30:11.800 --> 00:30:13.390 align:middle line:84%
So can we talk
about what happens

00:30:13.390 --> 00:30:15.760 align:middle line:84%
when your destiny
is something that

00:30:15.760 --> 00:30:17.560 align:middle line:84%
would seem frivolous
to someone else,

00:30:17.560 --> 00:30:20.350 align:middle line:84%
but is just so powerful
for you, and you still

00:30:20.350 --> 00:30:23.229 align:middle line:90%
have to do a day job?

00:30:23.229 --> 00:30:25.020 align:middle line:84%
>> PARKYN: It's a tricky
subject, for sure.

00:30:25.020 --> 00:30:27.750 align:middle line:84%
>> EASTWOOD: I mean, do you know
of people whose destiny would

00:30:27.750 --> 00:30:30.700 align:middle line:84%
not have some real significance
for society if they were living

00:30:30.700 --> 00:30:31.500 align:middle line:90%
it?

00:30:31.500 --> 00:30:35.030 align:middle line:84%
I mean, I haven't
met anyone like that.

00:30:35.030 --> 00:30:38.270 align:middle line:84%
So, I mean, it could be true
that, for instance, people

00:30:38.270 --> 00:30:42.010 align:middle line:84%
whose path gets expressed
best by being artist.

00:30:42.010 --> 00:30:44.400 align:middle line:84%
They can have a difficult
time monetizing that,

00:30:44.400 --> 00:30:47.420 align:middle line:84%
but I know artists
who also do very well.

00:30:47.420 --> 00:30:52.460 align:middle line:10%
So my sense is that when we're
being true to our nature,

00:30:52.460 --> 00:30:55.280 align:middle line:10%
we're fulfilling our
destiny, that there's

00:30:55.280 --> 00:30:59.300 align:middle line:10%
a level of fulfillment that
can happen and does happen.

00:30:59.300 --> 00:31:04.954 align:middle line:84%
And there's a way to bring the
resources that we need to us.

00:31:04.954 --> 00:31:06.370 align:middle line:84%
When we're being
true to our self,

00:31:06.370 --> 00:31:08.810 align:middle line:84%
it's easier to see
what that way is.

00:31:08.810 --> 00:31:10.310 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: That
makes perfect sense.

00:31:10.310 --> 00:31:12.550 align:middle line:84%
So now, I'm going
to bring up a case.

00:31:12.550 --> 00:31:13.820 align:middle line:90%
And you said it's tricky.

00:31:13.820 --> 00:31:15.730 align:middle line:84%
And then, it'll
flow to you next.

00:31:15.730 --> 00:31:19.320 align:middle line:84%
It's someone who just
frustrated in business,

00:31:19.320 --> 00:31:20.860 align:middle line:84%
things keep crashing
and burning.

00:31:20.860 --> 00:31:24.910 align:middle line:84%
Great ideas, doesn't really
come to what he'd like it to,

00:31:24.910 --> 00:31:26.330 align:middle line:90%
but kept ignoring one thing.

00:31:26.330 --> 00:31:29.920 align:middle line:84%
He loved to sing, just loved
to sing and was avoiding it.

00:31:29.920 --> 00:31:32.020 align:middle line:84%
Like, oh, I'm not good
enough, or whatnot.

00:31:32.020 --> 00:31:36.080 align:middle line:84%
In fact, was on BBC a live
solo Christmas day as a child,

00:31:36.080 --> 00:31:36.880 align:middle line:90%
you know?

00:31:36.880 --> 00:31:38.560 align:middle line:90%
I mean, this is a good voice.

00:31:38.560 --> 00:31:43.630 align:middle line:84%
And so, then came a
time where he was so sad

00:31:43.630 --> 00:31:45.130 align:middle line:84%
and kind of busted
apart by life,

00:31:45.130 --> 00:31:47.350 align:middle line:84%
that he started
singing again, and went

00:31:47.350 --> 00:31:50.071 align:middle line:84%
to a church that had a choir
so he could join the choir.

00:31:50.071 --> 00:31:51.070 align:middle line:90%
And then, another choir.

00:31:51.070 --> 00:31:52.450 align:middle line:90%
Then, a community choir.

00:31:52.450 --> 00:31:55.420 align:middle line:84%
And now, all he does, he's
in rehearsal constantly.

00:31:55.420 --> 00:31:59.170 align:middle line:84%
Now, he's not being paid for
these church and community

00:31:59.170 --> 00:32:02.950 align:middle line:84%
endeavors, but he's so
happy and he does a day job

00:32:02.950 --> 00:32:05.750 align:middle line:90%
that is kind of boring to him.

00:32:05.750 --> 00:32:07.990 align:middle line:84%
But the sense of
fulfillment is there.

00:32:07.990 --> 00:32:10.900 align:middle line:84%
Now, he still wishes somehow
that that would pay the bills.

00:32:10.900 --> 00:32:13.250 align:middle line:84%
But that's not where
life is at this time.

00:32:13.250 --> 00:32:15.550 align:middle line:84%
So what is the tricky part
of it you're talking about?

00:32:15.550 --> 00:32:18.133 align:middle line:84%
>> PARKYN: Well, the tricky part
is coming to terms with that.

00:32:18.133 --> 00:32:19.150 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Yes.

00:32:19.150 --> 00:32:21.580 align:middle line:84%
>> PARKYN: Where is
your fulfillment?

00:32:21.580 --> 00:32:25.000 align:middle line:10%
To me, when I go into a store
and I talk with the cashier

00:32:25.000 --> 00:32:27.466 align:middle line:10%
or somebody and I say how
it's going, and they say,

00:32:27.466 --> 00:32:28.840 align:middle line:10%
you know, I'm
nearly out of here.

00:32:28.840 --> 00:32:31.660 align:middle line:84%
And you know, they're
watching the clock.

00:32:31.660 --> 00:32:34.570 align:middle line:84%
And all we have in
this life is time.

00:32:34.570 --> 00:32:36.610 align:middle line:84%
And literally, their
whole intention

00:32:36.610 --> 00:32:39.820 align:middle line:84%
is watching the clock so they
can finish with this thing

00:32:39.820 --> 00:32:42.200 align:middle line:84%
and get out and
do something else.

00:32:42.200 --> 00:32:47.159 align:middle line:84%
And really, this life
is such a blessing.

00:32:47.159 --> 00:32:49.450 align:middle line:84%
Whatever it is we're doing,
whatever's happening to us,

00:32:49.450 --> 00:32:52.237 align:middle line:90%
it's a very precious space.

00:32:52.237 --> 00:32:53.820 align:middle line:84%
And so I would always
say to somebody,

00:32:53.820 --> 00:32:55.650 align:middle line:90%
you understand your design.

00:32:55.650 --> 00:32:58.110 align:middle line:84%
You understand how your
design works for you.

00:32:58.110 --> 00:33:00.660 align:middle line:90%
You understand your life path.

00:33:00.660 --> 00:33:04.620 align:middle line:84%
And you accept according to your
own nature, your own choices,

00:33:04.620 --> 00:33:08.130 align:middle line:84%
your own decisions that you
make according to your design.

00:33:08.130 --> 00:33:10.650 align:middle line:84%
And you'll find that
it takes you where

00:33:10.650 --> 00:33:13.230 align:middle line:90%
you're going to be fulfilled.

00:33:13.230 --> 00:33:17.010 align:middle line:84%
So there isn't a necessity
to be in a job that

00:33:17.010 --> 00:33:19.770 align:middle line:84%
is going to bring you
suffering because you're always

00:33:19.770 --> 00:33:21.150 align:middle line:90%
looking at the clock.

00:33:21.150 --> 00:33:23.130 align:middle line:84%
It could also be a
job that you're really

00:33:23.130 --> 00:33:26.370 align:middle line:84%
engaging with the people
that come past you.

00:33:26.370 --> 00:33:30.930 align:middle line:84%
And so it's tricky up
until that point in time

00:33:30.930 --> 00:33:32.500 align:middle line:90%
that you have that acceptance.

00:33:32.500 --> 00:33:33.300 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Right.

00:33:33.300 --> 00:33:36.420 align:middle line:84%
>> PARKYN: And I totally endorse
this person that loves to sing

00:33:36.420 --> 00:33:40.110 align:middle line:84%
and doesn't get paid for it,
but it brings him fulfillment.

00:33:40.110 --> 00:33:41.110 align:middle line:90%
It nourishes him.

00:33:41.110 --> 00:33:43.159 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: And it
makes the day job OK.

00:33:43.159 --> 00:33:44.700 align:middle line:84%
If he's watching
the clock, it's just

00:33:44.700 --> 00:33:46.074 align:middle line:84%
to get back to
some more singing.

00:33:46.074 --> 00:33:47.280 align:middle line:90%
But life is joyful.

00:33:47.280 --> 00:33:48.080 align:middle line:90%
>> PARKYN: Indeed.

00:33:48.080 --> 00:33:50.850 align:middle line:84%
But what I would say is if
he went a little bit further,

00:33:50.850 --> 00:33:54.277 align:middle line:84%
he would also find that the
day job can bring him joy too.

00:33:54.277 --> 00:33:55.360 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Right, exactly.

00:33:55.360 --> 00:33:58.590 align:middle line:84%
So that's what I say because
I think people sometimes

00:33:58.590 --> 00:34:00.900 align:middle line:84%
get caught in that
matrix a little bit.

00:34:00.900 --> 00:34:02.640 align:middle line:84%
So when we're
looking at a chart,

00:34:02.640 --> 00:34:05.520 align:middle line:84%
you know we've already gone
over the four main energy types.

00:34:05.520 --> 00:34:07.805 align:middle line:84%
But then there are other
kind of types within that.

00:34:07.805 --> 00:34:09.179 align:middle line:84%
And then, there
are more nuances.

00:34:09.179 --> 00:34:11.159 align:middle line:84%
And you get down to
the "Book of Destinies"

00:34:11.159 --> 00:34:13.870 align:middle line:84%
which could seem very
complicated to compute.

00:34:13.870 --> 00:34:16.450 align:middle line:84%
But you've done it for us
because you have a software

00:34:16.450 --> 00:34:17.250 align:middle line:90%
program--

00:34:17.250 --> 00:34:19.800 align:middle line:84%
thank you-- that tells
us these things for us.

00:34:19.800 --> 00:34:21.570 align:middle line:84%
Then, you just thumb
through to the page

00:34:21.570 --> 00:34:22.889 align:middle line:90%
that tells you your type.

00:34:22.889 --> 00:34:24.750 align:middle line:84%
So I mean, that's the
beauty of this book.

00:34:24.750 --> 00:34:27.510 align:middle line:84%
Anybody can use the
software and do that.

00:34:27.510 --> 00:34:32.370 align:middle line:84%
But let's get an idea of, like,
mine has to do with emotions.

00:34:32.370 --> 00:34:36.150 align:middle line:84%
My way of functioning, I guess,
is as an emotional being.

00:34:36.150 --> 00:34:37.360 align:middle line:90%
I don't know what yours are.

00:34:37.360 --> 00:34:39.693 align:middle line:84%
But let's talk about some of
those kind of subtle layers

00:34:39.693 --> 00:34:41.489 align:middle line:84%
that happen after
the big energy type.

00:34:41.489 --> 00:34:43.860 align:middle line:84%
>> PARKYN: Well, the subtle
layers are how we make

00:34:43.860 --> 00:34:44.940 align:middle line:90%
decisions.

00:34:44.940 --> 00:34:46.860 align:middle line:84%
And all three of us
at the table here,

00:34:46.860 --> 00:34:49.390 align:middle line:84%
we all having this
emotional authority.

00:34:49.390 --> 00:34:50.190 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Oh, OK.

00:34:50.190 --> 00:34:51.939 align:middle line:84%
>> PARKYN: We all have
this feeling sense.

00:34:51.939 --> 00:34:52.800 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Yes.

00:34:52.800 --> 00:34:55.770 align:middle line:84%
>> PARKYN: In some level or
another, we enjoy the drama.

00:34:55.770 --> 00:34:58.170 align:middle line:84%
Life goes up,
everything is exciting.

00:34:58.170 --> 00:35:00.350 align:middle line:84%
Life goes down, I'm
not feeling it today.

00:35:00.350 --> 00:35:03.120 align:middle line:84%
Oh, but we're back up again,
everything's good again.

00:35:03.120 --> 00:35:04.570 align:middle line:90%
And you know, we're just--

00:35:04.570 --> 00:35:06.500 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: It's a very
feeling experience.

00:35:06.500 --> 00:35:07.500 align:middle line:90%
>> PARKYN: Very much so.

00:35:07.500 --> 00:35:09.180 align:middle line:84%
And we affect
everybody around us.

00:35:09.180 --> 00:35:10.344 align:middle line:90%
Everybody picks up on this.

00:35:10.344 --> 00:35:12.010 align:middle line:84%
And for some people,
it's like you know,

00:35:12.010 --> 00:35:14.426 align:middle line:84%
I'm just going to steer a
little bit clearer of these guys

00:35:14.426 --> 00:35:16.680 align:middle line:84%
because they're getting
carried away here.

00:35:16.680 --> 00:35:18.632 align:middle line:90%
So we have emotional authority.

00:35:18.632 --> 00:35:20.590 align:middle line:84%
And you know, when you're
up in your authority,

00:35:20.590 --> 00:35:22.460 align:middle line:84%
you're having a
wonderful day, there's

00:35:22.460 --> 00:35:25.710 align:middle line:84%
a possibility to commit to
something just because you're

00:35:25.710 --> 00:35:26.530 align:middle line:90%
in a good mood.

00:35:26.530 --> 00:35:28.420 align:middle line:84%
And sure enough,
once it shows up,

00:35:28.420 --> 00:35:30.420 align:middle line:84%
it's like, I don't feel
like doing this anymore.

00:35:30.420 --> 00:35:32.420 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: That was a
manic day when I said yes.

00:35:32.420 --> 00:35:34.320 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHING]

00:35:34.320 --> 00:35:37.260 align:middle line:84%
>> PARKYN: So we have to find
what we call a still point.

00:35:37.260 --> 00:35:39.900 align:middle line:84%
The emotional authority of
the solar plexus and the body,

00:35:39.900 --> 00:35:42.150 align:middle line:84%
we have to find that still
point that is not attached

00:35:42.150 --> 00:35:44.760 align:middle line:84%
to the outcomes or
the great excitements

00:35:44.760 --> 00:35:46.800 align:middle line:84%
or the great
disasters, that we just

00:35:46.800 --> 00:35:49.140 align:middle line:84%
have a feeling clarity
that carries us

00:35:49.140 --> 00:35:52.440 align:middle line:84%
through whatever an objective
is and out the other side.

00:35:52.440 --> 00:35:54.600 align:middle line:84%
And we follow the
flow of it all.

00:35:54.600 --> 00:35:57.534 align:middle line:84%
We come to a still point
when we make a decision.

00:35:57.534 --> 00:35:59.700 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: And yet, our
intelligence and our ability

00:35:59.700 --> 00:36:02.470 align:middle line:84%
to make decisions is very
much based on these feelings

00:36:02.470 --> 00:36:03.270 align:middle line:90%
as well.

00:36:03.270 --> 00:36:04.950 align:middle line:90%
You were going to say something?

00:36:04.950 --> 00:36:09.570 align:middle line:84%
>> EASTWOOD: Yes, well, I was
reiterating that it's simply

00:36:09.570 --> 00:36:11.790 align:middle line:84%
that point of
finding the clarity.

00:36:11.790 --> 00:36:14.970 align:middle line:84%
And we don't find the
clarity when we're seeking

00:36:14.970 --> 00:36:16.780 align:middle line:90%
for an answer for ourselves.

00:36:16.780 --> 00:36:20.740 align:middle line:84%
We don't find the clarity if
we're attached to the outcome.

00:36:20.740 --> 00:36:21.540 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Right.

00:36:21.540 --> 00:36:24.270 align:middle line:84%
>> EASTWOOD: So that's one
step that people with emotional

00:36:24.270 --> 00:36:28.380 align:middle line:84%
authority need to know,
that it's letting go

00:36:28.380 --> 00:36:29.550 align:middle line:90%
of the attachment.

00:36:29.550 --> 00:36:32.430 align:middle line:84%
What you're looking
for is the truth.

00:36:32.430 --> 00:36:34.950 align:middle line:84%
It's not what you want
it to be necessarily.

00:36:34.950 --> 00:36:37.440 align:middle line:84%
It might be, but it's
not necessarily that.

00:36:37.440 --> 00:36:39.705 align:middle line:90%
It's what your truth is--

00:36:39.705 --> 00:36:40.590 align:middle line:90%
your higher truth.

00:36:40.590 --> 00:36:42.923 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: Yeah, you don't
want to make a decision while

00:36:42.923 --> 00:36:44.100 align:middle line:90%
you're on a high or a low.

00:36:44.100 --> 00:36:46.800 align:middle line:84%
Like you say, finding that still
point and finding the truth.

00:36:46.800 --> 00:36:49.371 align:middle line:84%
So for an emotional type,
that's going to work.

00:36:49.371 --> 00:36:51.870 align:middle line:84%
Tell us some of the other types
and how they have authority.

00:36:51.870 --> 00:36:54.270 align:middle line:84%
>> PARKYN: Well, I
should mention about 50%

00:36:54.270 --> 00:36:56.740 align:middle line:84%
of the world's population
have that emotional authority.

00:36:56.740 --> 00:36:57.540 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: OK.

00:36:57.540 --> 00:37:01.050 align:middle line:84%
>> PARKYN: And almost 90%
of partners in partnership

00:37:01.050 --> 00:37:03.720 align:middle line:84%
and relationships have
that emotional authority.

00:37:03.720 --> 00:37:05.900 align:middle line:84%
So they need to
understand this as well.

00:37:05.900 --> 00:37:07.340 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: Yes,
that's important.

00:37:07.340 --> 00:37:09.840 align:middle line:84%
>> PARKYN: So the next one is
what we call sacral authority.

00:37:09.840 --> 00:37:12.270 align:middle line:84%
These are people that just get
a gut response to something

00:37:12.270 --> 00:37:15.780 align:middle line:84%
and it either tells them yes,
interesting, I'm on this thing,

00:37:15.780 --> 00:37:16.910 align:middle line:90%
or not now.

00:37:16.910 --> 00:37:17.710 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: OK.

00:37:17.710 --> 00:37:19.640 align:middle line:90%
>> PARKYN: Uh-huh, uh-uh.

00:37:19.640 --> 00:37:21.247 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: Kind of
like generators.

00:37:21.247 --> 00:37:22.830 align:middle line:84%
>> PARKYN: It is
that generator thing,

00:37:22.830 --> 00:37:25.914 align:middle line:84%
but some generators also have
that emotional quality as well.

00:37:25.914 --> 00:37:28.330 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: So even more so,
just go with the gut response.

00:37:28.330 --> 00:37:30.180 align:middle line:84%
>> PARKYN: Go with the gut
response, just like that,

00:37:30.180 --> 00:37:30.980 align:middle line:90%
give it a go.

00:37:30.980 --> 00:37:32.280 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: OK, and another?

00:37:32.280 --> 00:37:34.405 align:middle line:84%
>> PARKYN: --is what we
call the splenic authority.

00:37:34.405 --> 00:37:36.840 align:middle line:84%
These are the ones that
live on their wits.

00:37:36.840 --> 00:37:38.490 align:middle line:90%
They just get it.

00:37:38.490 --> 00:37:41.200 align:middle line:84%
Intuition, instinct,
something or other,

00:37:41.200 --> 00:37:42.970 align:middle line:84%
they get the download,
they're on it.

00:37:42.970 --> 00:37:44.654 align:middle line:84%
They're the fastest
people in the room.

00:37:44.654 --> 00:37:46.320 align:middle line:84%
And the rest of us,
it's like, you know,

00:37:46.320 --> 00:37:47.634 align:middle line:90%
are you sure you've got it?

00:37:47.634 --> 00:37:48.966 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHING]

00:37:48.966 --> 00:37:50.580 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Yeah, exactly.

00:37:50.580 --> 00:37:52.672 align:middle line:84%
So when you're
looking at, it's kind

00:37:52.672 --> 00:37:54.630 align:middle line:84%
of an overlay of a
combination of these traits.

00:37:54.630 --> 00:37:55.838 align:middle line:90%
And then there are all these.

00:37:55.838 --> 00:37:56.797 align:middle line:90%
It's a complex system.

00:37:56.797 --> 00:37:58.380 align:middle line:84%
And we'll take a
look at it and people

00:37:58.380 --> 00:38:01.080 align:middle line:84%
can see on screen what
a chart looks like.

00:38:01.080 --> 00:38:04.110 align:middle line:84%
You have all of these
lines and colors of lines

00:38:04.110 --> 00:38:07.140 align:middle line:84%
and broken lines and
such going from one part

00:38:07.140 --> 00:38:10.144 align:middle line:84%
to another that almost
looks like a tree of life.

00:38:10.144 --> 00:38:11.310 align:middle line:90%
>> PARKYN: Somewhat similar.

00:38:11.310 --> 00:38:12.570 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Somewhat similar.

00:38:12.570 --> 00:38:14.950 align:middle line:84%
And so let's talk about
what those gateways

00:38:14.950 --> 00:38:17.960 align:middle line:84%
or those channels,
those lines mean.

00:38:17.960 --> 00:38:19.990 align:middle line:84%
>> PARKYN: Well,
there are 64 gateways.

00:38:19.990 --> 00:38:22.150 align:middle line:84%
And the 64 is a magical
number because it

00:38:22.150 --> 00:38:25.475 align:middle line:84%
relates to the number of
genetic codons we have.

00:38:25.475 --> 00:38:27.850 align:middle line:84%
So in some way, when we're
looking into somebody's chart,

00:38:27.850 --> 00:38:31.270 align:middle line:84%
we're looking at their
genetic makeup on some level.

00:38:31.270 --> 00:38:33.640 align:middle line:84%
And the trick that
Carola and I have

00:38:33.640 --> 00:38:35.420 align:middle line:84%
been working with
all these years

00:38:35.420 --> 00:38:37.810 align:middle line:90%
is to know how to read this.

00:38:37.810 --> 00:38:39.330 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Yeah, it's not easy.

00:38:39.330 --> 00:38:41.770 align:middle line:84%
>> PARKYN: It is very
easy once you get it down.

00:38:41.770 --> 00:38:44.420 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: I've seen
people in the process.

00:38:44.420 --> 00:38:45.890 align:middle line:84%
>> PARKYN: It's
a learning curve.

00:38:45.890 --> 00:38:46.930 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Right.

00:38:46.930 --> 00:38:49.290 align:middle line:84%
>> PARKYN: But we train
people, we get people enough

00:38:49.290 --> 00:38:52.900 align:middle line:84%
on the track of learning this
and, you know, getting into it.

00:38:52.900 --> 00:38:56.595 align:middle line:84%
So, yes, there are nine
centers in human design.

00:38:56.595 --> 00:38:58.720 align:middle line:84%
Now, anyone that is familiar
with the chakra system

00:38:58.720 --> 00:39:00.790 align:middle line:84%
will say, well, hang on,
there are seven chakras.

00:39:00.790 --> 00:39:03.070 align:middle line:90%
How come there are nine centers?

00:39:03.070 --> 00:39:05.680 align:middle line:84%
Well, it's not to dispute
the seven chakras.

00:39:05.680 --> 00:39:09.420 align:middle line:10%
But it is to say there are two
centers that are extras now.

00:39:09.420 --> 00:39:10.990 align:middle line:10%
The one is the
spleen center, which

00:39:10.990 --> 00:39:13.220 align:middle line:10%
is all about our immune system.

00:39:13.220 --> 00:39:15.730 align:middle line:10%
It used to be tied into
the root center which

00:39:15.730 --> 00:39:18.430 align:middle line:10%
was all about fight and
flight and survival.

00:39:18.430 --> 00:39:20.050 align:middle line:84%
And now in the
21st century, these

00:39:20.050 --> 00:39:22.460 align:middle line:84%
are not issues for us anymore,
if we're being sensible.

00:39:22.460 --> 00:39:23.260 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Right.

00:39:23.260 --> 00:39:25.634 align:middle line:84%
>> PARKYN: We don't have to
worry about fight and flight.

00:39:25.634 --> 00:39:29.445 align:middle line:84%
And we can use these senses
towards very creative purposes.

00:39:29.445 --> 00:39:30.820 align:middle line:84%
The other one is
the heart center

00:39:30.820 --> 00:39:32.611 align:middle line:84%
that's separated from
what we call the self

00:39:32.611 --> 00:39:34.132 align:middle line:90%
center in human design.

00:39:34.132 --> 00:39:35.840 align:middle line:84%
So the self center
has always been there.

00:39:35.840 --> 00:39:37.540 align:middle line:90%
This is the seasons of the year.

00:39:37.540 --> 00:39:39.370 align:middle line:90%
This is the pagan festivals.

00:39:39.370 --> 00:39:40.600 align:middle line:90%
It's all of this.

00:39:40.600 --> 00:39:43.150 align:middle line:84%
And the heart center
now indicates to us--

00:39:43.150 --> 00:39:45.970 align:middle line:84%
and this is the most exciting
thing about human design--

00:39:45.970 --> 00:39:50.894 align:middle line:84%
we are now in a
time of free will.

00:39:50.894 --> 00:39:53.090 align:middle line:84%
And we have to be
really, really clear,

00:39:53.090 --> 00:39:56.940 align:middle line:84%
what is it that really
has value for us.

00:39:56.940 --> 00:39:59.750 align:middle line:84%
So this is part of the
human design system

00:39:59.750 --> 00:40:01.800 align:middle line:90%
that we actually can see.

00:40:01.800 --> 00:40:05.360 align:middle line:84%
We now can live
beyond what we would

00:40:05.360 --> 00:40:07.414 align:middle line:90%
call unconscious evolution.

00:40:07.414 --> 00:40:09.080 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: So you'd
say that it's almost

00:40:09.080 --> 00:40:11.420 align:middle line:84%
the soul's blueprint
that you're looking at.

00:40:11.420 --> 00:40:12.980 align:middle line:84%
If the soul were
speaking directly

00:40:12.980 --> 00:40:15.980 align:middle line:84%
to you in clear
language, It would point

00:40:15.980 --> 00:40:17.360 align:middle line:90%
you this way toward yourself.

00:40:17.360 --> 00:40:20.720 align:middle line:84%
>> PARKYN: It is exactly the
soul blueprint for the 21st

00:40:20.720 --> 00:40:21.644 align:middle line:90%
century and beyond.

00:40:21.644 --> 00:40:23.060 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: Well,
that makes sense.

00:40:23.060 --> 00:40:26.060 align:middle line:84%
Now, you go further
into the various themes

00:40:26.060 --> 00:40:29.180 align:middle line:84%
of life, which is what this
book is about-- your life theme.

00:40:29.180 --> 00:40:31.310 align:middle line:84%
You and I have the
same life theme, which

00:40:31.310 --> 00:40:33.590 align:middle line:90%
is the theme of explanation.

00:40:33.590 --> 00:40:36.860 align:middle line:84%
And so I have spent my
entire life in media,

00:40:36.860 --> 00:40:40.070 align:middle line:84%
chatting and trying to
describe things to people,

00:40:40.070 --> 00:40:41.900 align:middle line:90%
whatever the outlet was.

00:40:41.900 --> 00:40:43.555 align:middle line:90%
But again, it has a consequence.

00:40:43.555 --> 00:40:44.490 align:middle line:90%
>> EASTWOOD: Him too.

00:40:44.490 --> 00:40:46.170 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Yeah, yeah, exactly.

00:40:46.170 --> 00:40:47.990 align:middle line:84%
And it has this
consequence sometimes,

00:40:47.990 --> 00:40:50.240 align:middle line:84%
where you're sharing
things people don't always

00:40:50.240 --> 00:40:51.150 align:middle line:90%
want to hear as well.

00:40:51.150 --> 00:40:54.410 align:middle line:84%
So everything has
its beneficial side

00:40:54.410 --> 00:40:56.240 align:middle line:84%
and it has its side
that can be challenged,

00:40:56.240 --> 00:41:00.635 align:middle line:84%
like shooting your mouth off,
becoming a skunk at the picnic

00:41:00.635 --> 00:41:03.920 align:middle line:84%
if you have the
theme of explanation,

00:41:03.920 --> 00:41:04.900 align:middle line:90%
which we both have.

00:41:04.900 --> 00:41:07.217 align:middle line:84%
But I would say, certainly,
that's what you've

00:41:07.217 --> 00:41:08.300 align:middle line:90%
been doing with your life.

00:41:08.300 --> 00:41:10.050 align:middle line:84%
That is what I've been
doing with my life.

00:41:10.050 --> 00:41:12.230 align:middle line:84%
So my soul would be
speaking perfectly

00:41:12.230 --> 00:41:13.490 align:middle line:90%
through my human design.

00:41:13.490 --> 00:41:15.310 align:middle line:90%
>> PARKYN: Absolutely the case.

00:41:15.310 --> 00:41:17.060 align:middle line:84%
And basically,
what you'll find is

00:41:17.060 --> 00:41:23.030 align:middle line:84%
there's a great power in your
voice in not always the words

00:41:23.030 --> 00:41:26.150 align:middle line:84%
that you're using, but very
much in the tone of voice.

00:41:26.150 --> 00:41:27.400 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: That's interesting.

00:41:27.400 --> 00:41:28.430 align:middle line:90%
>> PARKYN: Yeah.

00:41:28.430 --> 00:41:30.692 align:middle line:90%
It's all about the acoustics.

00:41:30.692 --> 00:41:31.650 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Interesting.

00:41:31.650 --> 00:41:32.517 align:middle line:90%
>> PARKYN: Yeah.

00:41:32.517 --> 00:41:34.850 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: Is that true for
everyone that has that theme

00:41:34.850 --> 00:41:35.730 align:middle line:90%
of explanation?

00:41:35.730 --> 00:41:36.938 align:middle line:90%
>> PARKYN: It is indeed true.

00:41:36.938 --> 00:41:41.210 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: So intonation, which
is kind of the feeling behind

00:41:41.210 --> 00:41:44.310 align:middle line:84%
or intention behind or
subconscious meaning behind

00:41:44.310 --> 00:41:45.110 align:middle line:90%
the words.

00:41:45.110 --> 00:41:46.970 align:middle line:84%
>> PARKYN: Along those lines,
but it's all about the sound

00:41:46.970 --> 00:41:47.380 align:middle line:90%
quality.

00:41:47.380 --> 00:41:48.180 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Yeah.

00:41:48.180 --> 00:41:50.390 align:middle line:84%
>> PARKYN: Transformation
happens through sound

00:41:50.390 --> 00:41:51.190 align:middle line:90%
and silence.

00:41:51.190 --> 00:41:53.750 align:middle line:90%


00:41:53.750 --> 00:41:57.560 align:middle line:84%
The world, society,
operates through the visual,

00:41:57.560 --> 00:41:58.730 align:middle line:90%
what we can share.

00:41:58.730 --> 00:41:59.840 align:middle line:90%
We agree there's a table.

00:41:59.840 --> 00:42:02.060 align:middle line:90%
We agree there's a cup.

00:42:02.060 --> 00:42:04.910 align:middle line:84%
That's society's
understanding of life.

00:42:04.910 --> 00:42:06.830 align:middle line:84%
But the individual
understanding of life--

00:42:06.830 --> 00:42:11.660 align:middle line:84%
the individual appreciation--
is through sound and silence.

00:42:11.660 --> 00:42:13.900 align:middle line:84%
The collective works
through knowledge.

00:42:13.900 --> 00:42:16.370 align:middle line:84%
And knowledge is something we
pass on all over the world.

00:42:16.370 --> 00:42:17.450 align:middle line:90%
Libraries are full of it.

00:42:17.450 --> 00:42:19.410 align:middle line:90%
The internet is full of it.

00:42:19.410 --> 00:42:24.090 align:middle line:84%
There's a difference between
knowledge and knowing.

00:42:24.090 --> 00:42:27.090 align:middle line:84%
Knowing is when you drop
into a space inside yourself

00:42:27.090 --> 00:42:30.270 align:middle line:84%
and there's no doubt or
question or anything about it,

00:42:30.270 --> 00:42:32.790 align:middle line:90%
you just know.

00:42:32.790 --> 00:42:35.220 align:middle line:84%
And that is part of
what we do in this life

00:42:35.220 --> 00:42:36.487 align:middle line:90%
theme of explanation.

00:42:36.487 --> 00:42:37.320 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Yes, yes.

00:42:37.320 --> 00:42:39.180 align:middle line:90%
I would say that is true.

00:42:39.180 --> 00:42:42.340 align:middle line:90%
And what is your theme?

00:42:42.340 --> 00:42:43.830 align:middle line:84%
>> EASTWOOD: Mine
his dedication.

00:42:43.830 --> 00:42:44.746 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Dedication.

00:42:44.746 --> 00:42:49.062 align:middle line:84%
And tell us how that has kind
of reflected what you've done

00:42:49.062 --> 00:42:50.770 align:middle line:84%
and when you discovered
that in yourself.

00:42:50.770 --> 00:42:52.380 align:middle line:84%
Because there are
so many, we're only

00:42:52.380 --> 00:42:53.770 align:middle line:90%
going to go by a few examples.

00:42:53.770 --> 00:42:56.250 align:middle line:84%
People need to look at the
book and figure their own out

00:42:56.250 --> 00:42:58.650 align:middle line:84%
because there are way too
many to do in an hour show.

00:42:58.650 --> 00:43:00.810 align:middle line:84%
So let's talk about your
life and dedication.

00:43:00.810 --> 00:43:02.580 align:middle line:90%
>> EASTWOOD: OK, dedication.

00:43:02.580 --> 00:43:06.090 align:middle line:84%
So dedication is the one that
follows on from explanation,

00:43:06.090 --> 00:43:07.350 align:middle line:90%
from where you are.

00:43:07.350 --> 00:43:12.270 align:middle line:84%
It's the transpersonal
expression

00:43:12.270 --> 00:43:13.590 align:middle line:90%
of the same channel--

00:43:13.590 --> 00:43:17.700 align:middle line:84%
the channel of individual
unique expression that is

00:43:17.700 --> 00:43:21.150 align:middle line:84%
conveyed through
sound and silence.

00:43:21.150 --> 00:43:27.390 align:middle line:84%
The difference with dedication
is that there's really,

00:43:27.390 --> 00:43:33.900 align:middle line:84%
a constant awareness of what
the effects are of everything

00:43:33.900 --> 00:43:37.890 align:middle line:84%
we say and of every
action we take on others.

00:43:37.890 --> 00:43:40.500 align:middle line:84%
So there's this sense
of responsibility

00:43:40.500 --> 00:43:43.140 align:middle line:84%
for others and for
others' outcomes

00:43:43.140 --> 00:43:47.580 align:middle line:84%
for others' experiences, and for
conveying a wisdom to them that

00:43:47.580 --> 00:43:54.240 align:middle line:84%
isn't necessarily there with
the theme of explanation.

00:43:54.240 --> 00:43:57.990 align:middle line:84%
It can be because it
can be an added element.

00:43:57.990 --> 00:44:01.290 align:middle line:90%
But the distinction is that--

00:44:01.290 --> 00:44:04.010 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: You can't be
careless with your words.

00:44:04.010 --> 00:44:07.150 align:middle line:84%
>> EASTWOOD: Right I
cannot be careless.

00:44:07.150 --> 00:44:09.540 align:middle line:84%
Because there's a
responsibility for how

00:44:09.540 --> 00:44:10.950 align:middle line:90%
my words are being taken--

00:44:10.950 --> 00:44:12.060 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Yes, yes.

00:44:12.060 --> 00:44:14.080 align:middle line:84%
>> EASTWOOD: --that
I feel personally.

00:44:14.080 --> 00:44:15.870 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: And now that follows
it because your birthday

00:44:15.870 --> 00:44:16.670 align:middle line:90%
follows it.

00:44:16.670 --> 00:44:19.800 align:middle line:84%
You're the 13th, I'm the
14th, you're the 16th,

00:44:19.800 --> 00:44:22.020 align:middle line:84%
and we're all Scorpios,
all of November.

00:44:22.020 --> 00:44:24.810 align:middle line:84%
Now let's talk
about, maybe hit on--

00:44:24.810 --> 00:44:26.370 align:middle line:90%
this is what I'm wondering.

00:44:26.370 --> 00:44:29.760 align:middle line:84%
Are there certain themes
among each generation

00:44:29.760 --> 00:44:32.610 align:middle line:84%
that start rising up that you
see more of in a generation,

00:44:32.610 --> 00:44:35.880 align:middle line:84%
versus less of with new
children kind of being

00:44:35.880 --> 00:44:37.990 align:middle line:90%
born at this time?

00:44:37.990 --> 00:44:41.730 align:middle line:84%
Is there a certain
kind of expansion

00:44:41.730 --> 00:44:45.870 align:middle line:84%
in numbers of a certain type of
life theme happening, or life

00:44:45.870 --> 00:44:47.541 align:middle line:90%
themes?

00:44:47.541 --> 00:44:50.040 align:middle line:84%
>> EASTWOOD: I think we should
say that we don't really know

00:44:50.040 --> 00:44:52.370 align:middle line:90%
the answer to that.

00:44:52.370 --> 00:44:57.480 align:middle line:84%
But the interesting thing is we
can see generational patterns

00:44:57.480 --> 00:44:58.910 align:middle line:90%
down through our genetic line.

00:44:58.910 --> 00:44:59.900 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Yeah, yeah.

00:44:59.900 --> 00:45:02.400 align:middle line:84%
>> EASTWOOD: And replications
of certain channels, you know.

00:45:02.400 --> 00:45:05.010 align:middle line:84%
So there's a
certain theme that's

00:45:05.010 --> 00:45:08.792 align:middle line:84%
been lived out through
the genetic line as well.

00:45:08.792 --> 00:45:09.750 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Makes sense.

00:45:09.750 --> 00:45:11.833 align:middle line:84%
>> EASTWOOD: The answer
to your question, I think,

00:45:11.833 --> 00:45:13.670 align:middle line:84%
would be fascinating
to find out.

00:45:13.670 --> 00:45:15.300 align:middle line:84%
But I think it would take
some research to discover.

00:45:15.300 --> 00:45:17.841 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: Oh, it would probably
take a lot of time to gather

00:45:17.841 --> 00:45:22.860 align:middle line:84%
the data and see in 2010, were
there any shifts in dominant

00:45:22.860 --> 00:45:27.047 align:middle line:84%
themes compared to
1960, for example?

00:45:27.047 --> 00:45:28.880 align:middle line:84%
>> EASTWOOD: You'd need
to collect all that.

00:45:28.880 --> 00:45:31.088 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: I'd just kind of
guess that there might be

00:45:31.088 --> 00:45:33.690 align:middle line:84%
something emerging because
of the need for a spiritual

00:45:33.690 --> 00:45:36.970 align:middle line:84%
expansion in the proper use
of free will, and so forth.

00:45:36.970 --> 00:45:39.600 align:middle line:84%
So let's talk about a
couple of the other life

00:45:39.600 --> 00:45:44.510 align:middle line:84%
themes that are really
interesting for these times.

00:45:44.510 --> 00:45:48.440 align:middle line:84%
>> PARKYN: So, I brought a
couple of examples with me.

00:45:48.440 --> 00:45:51.440 align:middle line:10%
And somebody who I thought might
be interesting to everybody

00:45:51.440 --> 00:45:56.970 align:middle line:10%
would be Henry Ford, started a
revolution in the car industry.

00:45:56.970 --> 00:46:00.630 align:middle line:10%
And he said, here's your car.

00:46:00.630 --> 00:46:03.130 align:middle line:84%
You can have any color you like,
but it's going to be black.

00:46:03.130 --> 00:46:04.020 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Right.

00:46:04.020 --> 00:46:06.150 align:middle line:84%
But we had wheels,
we had wheels.

00:46:06.150 --> 00:46:07.770 align:middle line:84%
>> PARKYN: And
you've got mobility.

00:46:07.770 --> 00:46:11.316 align:middle line:84%
And his life theme was the
life theme we call the alpha.

00:46:11.316 --> 00:46:12.690 align:middle line:84%
And the alpha is
someone we would

00:46:12.690 --> 00:46:14.340 align:middle line:90%
see as the leader of the pack.

00:46:14.340 --> 00:46:16.340 align:middle line:90%
He's out ahead.

00:46:16.340 --> 00:46:18.620 align:middle line:84%
Or at least, maybe he's
guiding from behind.

00:46:18.620 --> 00:46:21.290 align:middle line:84%
He's looking over
what is possible,

00:46:21.290 --> 00:46:24.950 align:middle line:84%
how it can all come together,
and pointing at things that

00:46:24.950 --> 00:46:26.690 align:middle line:90%
actually need to take place.

00:46:26.690 --> 00:46:29.100 align:middle line:84%
He's giving very
direct leadership.

00:46:29.100 --> 00:46:31.770 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: But what
was his energy type?

00:46:31.770 --> 00:46:34.020 align:middle line:84%
>> PARKYN: His energy type
is a manifesting generator.

00:46:34.020 --> 00:46:35.870 align:middle line:90%
Yeah, no shortage of energy.

00:46:35.870 --> 00:46:36.680 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Right.

00:46:36.680 --> 00:46:38.270 align:middle line:10%
>> PARKYN: Not
particularly emotional,

00:46:38.270 --> 00:46:40.728 align:middle line:10%
not particularly caught up in
everybody's ideas of what was

00:46:40.728 --> 00:46:46.310 align:middle line:10%
important or not, but very much
a driven man and would see his

00:46:46.310 --> 00:46:49.070 align:middle line:10%
thing come to be, and
would insist you know,

00:46:49.070 --> 00:46:50.847 align:middle line:10%
this is the way the
future is going.

00:46:50.847 --> 00:46:52.430 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: So what
was his life theme?

00:46:52.430 --> 00:46:54.847 align:middle line:84%
>> PARKYN: His life theme was
the life theme of the alpha.

00:46:54.847 --> 00:46:56.179 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Oh, the alpha, right.

00:46:56.179 --> 00:46:57.670 align:middle line:84%
You said that to
begin with, right.

00:46:57.670 --> 00:47:00.710 align:middle line:84%
>> PARKYN: And you know,
this is the field marshal.

00:47:00.710 --> 00:47:02.480 align:middle line:84%
This is not somebody
on the shop floor.

00:47:02.480 --> 00:47:06.050 align:middle line:84%
This is somebody that's
pointing for everybody.

00:47:06.050 --> 00:47:10.790 align:middle line:84%
And he literally set in place,
this revolution in industry.

00:47:10.790 --> 00:47:12.170 align:middle line:84%
He took the
Industrial Revolution

00:47:12.170 --> 00:47:13.370 align:middle line:90%
and revolutionized it.

00:47:13.370 --> 00:47:14.790 align:middle line:10%
>> REGINA: Absolutely.

00:47:14.790 --> 00:47:18.780 align:middle line:10%
That was a big shift in our
human destiny, no doubt.

00:47:18.780 --> 00:47:19.580 align:middle line:10%
>> PARKYN: Yeah.

00:47:19.580 --> 00:47:21.455 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: And so, we have
a couple of other people who

00:47:21.455 --> 00:47:22.580 align:middle line:90%
we're going to look at too.

00:47:22.580 --> 00:47:24.890 align:middle line:84%
>> PARKYN: Yeah, I have the
chart of Sir Arthur Conan

00:47:24.890 --> 00:47:25.580 align:middle line:90%
Doyle.

00:47:25.580 --> 00:47:26.210 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Yes.

00:47:26.210 --> 00:47:28.168 align:middle line:84%
>> PARKYN: Everyone heard
of "Sherlock Holmes"?

00:47:28.168 --> 00:47:29.420 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Yes, indeed.

00:47:29.420 --> 00:47:33.020 align:middle line:10%
>> PARKYN: So he also has this
manifesting generator design.

00:47:33.020 --> 00:47:34.640 align:middle line:10%
And his particular
life theme is one

00:47:34.640 --> 00:47:38.620 align:middle line:10%
we call the sleeping phoenix.

00:47:38.620 --> 00:47:39.620 align:middle line:90%
Interesting title there.

00:47:39.620 --> 00:47:40.578 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Yeah, it is.

00:47:40.578 --> 00:47:41.417 align:middle line:90%
So what's that mean?

00:47:41.417 --> 00:47:44.000 align:middle line:84%
>> PARKYN: It's basically a life
theme of somebody who's ahead

00:47:44.000 --> 00:47:45.980 align:middle line:90%
of their time.

00:47:45.980 --> 00:47:48.440 align:middle line:10%
And the phoenix we
know is a magical bird.

00:47:48.440 --> 00:47:51.470 align:middle line:10%
It's a healing bird,
but it also, it

00:47:51.470 --> 00:47:55.220 align:middle line:10%
has this propensity to fly
very high, do its thing

00:47:55.220 --> 00:47:57.380 align:middle line:10%
and then crash and burn.

00:47:57.380 --> 00:47:59.090 align:middle line:90%
And then, there's a new egg.

00:47:59.090 --> 00:48:01.610 align:middle line:84%
And from that egg
comes a new phoenix.

00:48:01.610 --> 00:48:04.130 align:middle line:84%
So you would see, if
you studied his life,

00:48:04.130 --> 00:48:06.280 align:middle line:84%
you'd see this was a
pattern in his life.

00:48:06.280 --> 00:48:08.430 align:middle line:84%
He'd go through all
these different things

00:48:08.430 --> 00:48:09.982 align:middle line:90%
trying to reinvent himself.

00:48:09.982 --> 00:48:11.690 align:middle line:84%
He wanted to get rid
of "Sherlock Holmes"

00:48:11.690 --> 00:48:13.010 align:middle line:90%
very early on.

00:48:13.010 --> 00:48:15.170 align:middle line:84%
But the public would
not let him do it.

00:48:15.170 --> 00:48:16.700 align:middle line:84%
So he had to keep
coming back to it

00:48:16.700 --> 00:48:18.950 align:middle line:84%
and being more and more
inventive and creative with it

00:48:18.950 --> 00:48:19.760 align:middle line:90%
all.

00:48:19.760 --> 00:48:22.070 align:middle line:84%
The sleeping part of
it-- sleeping phoenix--

00:48:22.070 --> 00:48:24.770 align:middle line:84%
generally, when I come across
somebody with this design,

00:48:24.770 --> 00:48:27.890 align:middle line:84%
they're at least 10 years
ahead of their time.

00:48:27.890 --> 00:48:30.720 align:middle line:84%
They are 10 years
ahead of everyone else.

00:48:30.720 --> 00:48:32.450 align:middle line:84%
And the great trick
for them is how do I

00:48:32.450 --> 00:48:35.300 align:middle line:84%
explain what it is
that I'm experiencing

00:48:35.300 --> 00:48:38.330 align:middle line:84%
in my life in a way that
people that are way behind me

00:48:38.330 --> 00:48:40.520 align:middle line:84%
are going to be
able to appreciate?

00:48:40.520 --> 00:48:43.700 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: And he had a depth
of spiritual understanding,

00:48:43.700 --> 00:48:45.110 align:middle line:90%
mystical understanding.

00:48:45.110 --> 00:48:47.147 align:middle line:84%
>> PARKYN: Huge,
huge understanding.

00:48:47.147 --> 00:48:49.730 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: So that alone would
have put him ahead of his time.

00:48:49.730 --> 00:48:52.132 align:middle line:84%
But again, like you say,
but how do you functionally

00:48:52.132 --> 00:48:53.090 align:middle line:90%
share that with people?

00:48:53.090 --> 00:48:54.750 align:middle line:90%
What's that look like?

00:48:54.750 --> 00:48:55.980 align:middle line:90%
>> PARKYN: How did he do it?

00:48:55.980 --> 00:48:58.105 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: I'm saying, that
would be his conundrum,

00:48:58.105 --> 00:48:59.600 align:middle line:84%
is how to functionally
share that.

00:48:59.600 --> 00:49:00.110 align:middle line:90%
>> PARKYN: Definitely.

00:49:00.110 --> 00:49:02.484 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: And I mean, just
using the character of Holmes

00:49:02.484 --> 00:49:06.740 align:middle line:84%
and the amount of supposedly
analysis but intuition,

00:49:06.740 --> 00:49:07.820 align:middle line:90%
for example.

00:49:07.820 --> 00:49:09.742 align:middle line:84%
The way he's put
things together.

00:49:09.742 --> 00:49:10.700 align:middle line:90%
>> PARKYN: Just genius.

00:49:10.700 --> 00:49:12.035 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Genius, yeah.

00:49:12.035 --> 00:49:13.220 align:middle line:84%
>> PARKYN: Yeah, way
ahead of his time.

00:49:13.220 --> 00:49:14.620 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: Way
ahead of his time.

00:49:14.620 --> 00:49:17.040 align:middle line:10%
>> PARKYN: So then, a
third chart that I got was

00:49:17.040 --> 00:49:20.060 align:middle line:10%
for Ammaji, also known
as the hugging saint.

00:49:20.060 --> 00:49:21.020 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Yes.

00:49:21.020 --> 00:49:23.900 align:middle line:84%
>> PARKYN: And her design
is a design of a reflector.

00:49:23.900 --> 00:49:27.230 align:middle line:10%
She's one of these rare beings,
just completely wide open,

00:49:27.230 --> 00:49:31.354 align:middle line:10%
completely in trust for whatever
life wants to put before her.

00:49:31.354 --> 00:49:33.020 align:middle line:84%
And her particular
life theme is the one

00:49:33.020 --> 00:49:35.564 align:middle line:84%
we call the interpersonal
life theme of healing.

00:49:35.564 --> 00:49:36.980 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: Oh,
well, there you go.

00:49:36.980 --> 00:49:37.800 align:middle line:90%
>> EASTWOOD: Right?

00:49:37.800 --> 00:49:38.660 align:middle line:90%
>> PARKYN: Indeed.

00:49:38.660 --> 00:49:39.920 align:middle line:90%
How could it be otherwise?

00:49:39.920 --> 00:49:40.930 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Right.

00:49:40.930 --> 00:49:42.470 align:middle line:84%
>> PARKYN: She hugs
somebody, and goodness knows

00:49:42.470 --> 00:49:43.601 align:middle line:90%
what's happened to them.

00:49:43.601 --> 00:49:46.100 align:middle line:84%
But all of a sudden, their life
is in a very, very different

00:49:46.100 --> 00:49:46.330 align:middle line:90%
experience.

00:49:46.330 --> 00:49:48.020 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: I've heard that from
a lot of people who have met

00:49:48.020 --> 00:49:49.280 align:middle line:90%
her, yeah.

00:49:49.280 --> 00:49:52.040 align:middle line:84%
>> PARKYN: People sitting
next to her, you know?

00:49:52.040 --> 00:49:55.290 align:middle line:84%
She doesn't have to touch them,
and all kinds of things happen.

00:49:55.290 --> 00:49:56.090 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Indeed.

00:49:56.090 --> 00:50:01.460 align:middle line:84%
In fact, I met one of the
little Ammas in Theru in India.

00:50:01.460 --> 00:50:03.570 align:middle line:84%
And there's a little
ashram for her.

00:50:03.570 --> 00:50:06.200 align:middle line:84%
She hasn't spoken in the last--
well, it'll be 40 years now.

00:50:06.200 --> 00:50:07.760 align:middle line:90%
She hasn't spoken in 30 years.

00:50:07.760 --> 00:50:09.800 align:middle line:84%
But she had that
same countenance.

00:50:09.800 --> 00:50:11.720 align:middle line:84%
She didn't touch
anyone, she just

00:50:11.720 --> 00:50:14.060 align:middle line:84%
came through with a
little smile, sat down,

00:50:14.060 --> 00:50:15.590 align:middle line:90%
and you just sat with her.

00:50:15.590 --> 00:50:18.590 align:middle line:84%
And you think, if you want
to be skeptical about it,

00:50:18.590 --> 00:50:20.570 align:middle line:84%
you're just buying it
and you're creating it.

00:50:20.570 --> 00:50:24.260 align:middle line:84%
But I was there, my son
was there at the same time.

00:50:24.260 --> 00:50:27.046 align:middle line:84%
And I remember being with
her in one of those sessions.

00:50:27.046 --> 00:50:28.170 align:middle line:90%
You're kind of blissed out.

00:50:28.170 --> 00:50:29.510 align:middle line:84%
And I thought, I'm
going to open my eyes

00:50:29.510 --> 00:50:31.520 align:middle line:84%
and see what's going on in
this room, which was packed.

00:50:31.520 --> 00:50:33.120 align:middle line:84%
Everyone was sitting
on the floor.

00:50:33.120 --> 00:50:35.090 align:middle line:84%
And I saw her looking
at a few people.

00:50:35.090 --> 00:50:38.540 align:middle line:84%
And when her eyes went there,
it was like a ball of energy

00:50:38.540 --> 00:50:41.270 align:middle line:84%
flying out of her
into this person, just

00:50:41.270 --> 00:50:43.130 align:middle line:90%
this little beneficent smile.

00:50:43.130 --> 00:50:46.040 align:middle line:84%
And she saw me looking at her
and turned around, zapped me.

00:50:46.040 --> 00:50:48.050 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHING]

00:50:48.050 --> 00:50:51.950 align:middle line:84%
And it was this kind
same, blissful, loving,

00:50:51.950 --> 00:50:53.990 align:middle line:84%
no words necessary
type of healing.

00:50:53.990 --> 00:50:54.980 align:middle line:90%
>> PARKYN: Exactly.

00:50:54.980 --> 00:50:56.945 align:middle line:84%
So within the life
being such a mystery

00:50:56.945 --> 00:50:59.460 align:middle line:84%
for all of us, when you
know your life theme,

00:50:59.460 --> 00:51:01.280 align:middle line:84%
or at least from
this side of things,

00:51:01.280 --> 00:51:04.280 align:middle line:84%
we can appreciate this is
what she brings through,

00:51:04.280 --> 00:51:06.700 align:middle line:84%
is she just brings
through this healing.

00:51:06.700 --> 00:51:09.500 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: And really, which is
closely associated with love.

00:51:09.500 --> 00:51:11.870 align:middle line:84%
And there are some people
that are not as well known.

00:51:11.870 --> 00:51:14.180 align:middle line:84%
And you have a
couple of examples

00:51:14.180 --> 00:51:16.060 align:middle line:90%
of people who had no idea.

00:51:16.060 --> 00:51:17.360 align:middle line:90%
They were totally lost.

00:51:17.360 --> 00:51:19.660 align:middle line:84%
And came in, just, I
don't know my theme,

00:51:19.660 --> 00:51:21.850 align:middle line:84%
and are caught by surprise
when they find out

00:51:21.850 --> 00:51:22.690 align:middle line:90%
what their theme is.

00:51:22.690 --> 00:51:26.290 align:middle line:84%
And let's talk about how
that works once someone

00:51:26.290 --> 00:51:27.590 align:middle line:90%
learns of this thing.

00:51:27.590 --> 00:51:30.179 align:middle line:84%
And then you have
to respond to it--

00:51:30.179 --> 00:51:32.220 align:middle line:84%
or, you don't have to,
but you choose to respond.

00:51:32.220 --> 00:51:33.270 align:middle line:90%
>> EASTWOOD: Right.

00:51:33.270 --> 00:51:37.240 align:middle line:84%
If you're at all looking in your
life, you're at all seeking,

00:51:37.240 --> 00:51:39.240 align:middle line:84%
then it would be
easy to respond to.

00:51:39.240 --> 00:51:43.890 align:middle line:84%
So I do transformational
business coaching.

00:51:43.890 --> 00:51:48.540 align:middle line:84%
And I had a client who
was also a business coach.

00:51:48.540 --> 00:51:53.340 align:middle line:84%
His name was Richard, graduated
from Columbia University

00:51:53.340 --> 00:52:00.936 align:middle line:84%
with a master's in business,
extremely intelligent man.

00:52:00.936 --> 00:52:04.500 align:middle line:84%
A brilliant man who
was very successful

00:52:04.500 --> 00:52:10.700 align:middle line:84%
as well, financially successful,
coaching Fortune 500 CEOs.

00:52:10.700 --> 00:52:15.590 align:middle line:84%
And he was at a point in his
life, he came to both of us,

00:52:15.590 --> 00:52:17.270 align:middle line:90%
actually, for design.

00:52:17.270 --> 00:52:20.840 align:middle line:84%
He came to me for a life
path reading and looking

00:52:20.840 --> 00:52:24.050 align:middle line:84%
at his-- you know, trying
to understand why he wasn't

00:52:24.050 --> 00:52:27.740 align:middle line:90%
feeling so fulfilled, you know?

00:52:27.740 --> 00:52:30.890 align:middle line:84%
Look at his life, and
married, beautiful children,

00:52:30.890 --> 00:52:32.510 align:middle line:84%
great career, made
tons of money.

00:52:32.510 --> 00:52:34.400 align:middle line:84%
I mean, you couldn't find
anything wrong with his life.

00:52:34.400 --> 00:52:35.350 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: Well put
together, right?

00:52:35.350 --> 00:52:37.430 align:middle line:84%
>> EASTWOOD: But he
was unhappy inside.

00:52:37.430 --> 00:52:39.720 align:middle line:90%
Something was missing.

00:52:39.720 --> 00:52:45.484 align:middle line:84%
And we discovered that his life
theme is the theme of the--

00:52:45.484 --> 00:52:46.400 align:middle line:90%
>> PARKYN: The Sphinx.

00:52:46.400 --> 00:52:49.190 align:middle line:84%
>> EASTWOOD: --the Sphinx,
right, that points the way,

00:52:49.190 --> 00:52:50.240 align:middle line:90%
right?

00:52:50.240 --> 00:52:53.330 align:middle line:84%
So when we look at
his design, and we

00:52:53.330 --> 00:52:58.500 align:middle line:84%
saw that his design had so
much of that knowing circuitry

00:52:58.500 --> 00:53:02.150 align:middle line:84%
we were talking about,
that we knew that he

00:53:02.150 --> 00:53:04.790 align:middle line:90%
is an agent of transformation.

00:53:04.790 --> 00:53:10.210 align:middle line:84%
And then when we saw the
life destiny as the Sphinx,

00:53:10.210 --> 00:53:12.250 align:middle line:84%
then we understood
that he's here

00:53:12.250 --> 00:53:15.890 align:middle line:84%
bringing transformation and
pointing the way for others.

00:53:15.890 --> 00:53:18.910 align:middle line:84%
And that's the element that
wasn't there in his coaching.

00:53:18.910 --> 00:53:21.070 align:middle line:84%
You know, he was doing
traditional kind of business

00:53:21.070 --> 00:53:24.250 align:middle line:90%
coaching, strategic coaching.

00:53:24.250 --> 00:53:26.110 align:middle line:84%
And it wasn't satisfying
for him because he

00:53:26.110 --> 00:53:29.350 align:middle line:84%
wasn't using all of
himself, all of what

00:53:29.350 --> 00:53:31.240 align:middle line:90%
he was truly capable of doing.

00:53:31.240 --> 00:53:33.760 align:middle line:84%
When he discovered
that and he started

00:53:33.760 --> 00:53:39.850 align:middle line:84%
integrating that
understanding, he completely

00:53:39.850 --> 00:53:43.180 align:middle line:84%
transformed his entire
practice, his entire business

00:53:43.180 --> 00:53:45.910 align:middle line:84%
and his business
model, so that now--

00:53:45.910 --> 00:53:50.530 align:middle line:84%
and he's still coaching the
same community of people,

00:53:50.530 --> 00:53:55.930 align:middle line:84%
but he's finding the ones who
are ready to begin awakening,

00:53:55.930 --> 00:54:00.750 align:middle line:84%
to begin their journey of
exploration of self-discovery,

00:54:00.750 --> 00:54:02.530 align:middle line:90%
of connecting with their path.

00:54:02.530 --> 00:54:07.750 align:middle line:84%
He is pointing the way to
their destiny, to their truth.

00:54:07.750 --> 00:54:08.960 align:middle line:90%
And he loves it.

00:54:08.960 --> 00:54:09.820 align:middle line:90%
He is so alive.

00:54:09.820 --> 00:54:11.645 align:middle line:90%
He's just come back alive now.

00:54:11.645 --> 00:54:12.520 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: I love it.

00:54:12.520 --> 00:54:15.730 align:middle line:84%
Let's talk about someone
who's so far off base,

00:54:15.730 --> 00:54:18.610 align:middle line:84%
you couldn't be living more
opposite than what you're

00:54:18.610 --> 00:54:19.990 align:middle line:90%
human design is telling you.

00:54:19.990 --> 00:54:22.210 align:middle line:84%
And I'm sure you can find
an example or two of that.

00:54:22.210 --> 00:54:24.650 align:middle line:90%
And then, what happens?

00:54:24.650 --> 00:54:27.140 align:middle line:84%
>> PARKYN: Well, life is an
exploration, that's for sure.

00:54:27.140 --> 00:54:33.700 align:middle line:84%
And yes, I have to remember a
few situations in life where

00:54:33.700 --> 00:54:37.000 align:middle line:84%
I'd read for somebody and
they tell me, you know,

00:54:37.000 --> 00:54:38.770 align:middle line:84%
I'm not quite sure
I can manage this.

00:54:38.770 --> 00:54:40.660 align:middle line:90%
It's a little bit too much.

00:54:40.660 --> 00:54:42.640 align:middle line:84%
And then they come
back to me and said,

00:54:42.640 --> 00:54:44.830 align:middle line:84%
you know, everything
you've told me,

00:54:44.830 --> 00:54:46.390 align:middle line:84%
I've listened back
to what you said,

00:54:46.390 --> 00:54:48.160 align:middle line:84%
I've listened back
through the recording.

00:54:48.160 --> 00:54:50.050 align:middle line:84%
Everything you told
me is on target.

00:54:50.050 --> 00:54:53.170 align:middle line:84%
It's on point and
I had totally been

00:54:53.170 --> 00:54:56.030 align:middle line:84%
distracted going a totally
different way in my life.

00:54:56.030 --> 00:54:58.310 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: Can you give us
kind of a concrete example?

00:54:58.310 --> 00:54:59.940 align:middle line:84%
Offhand, I know it's hard
to put you on the spot,

00:54:59.940 --> 00:55:01.856 align:middle line:84%
but maybe someone who
was just doing something

00:55:01.856 --> 00:55:05.249 align:middle line:84%
so completely in congress
with their actual design?

00:55:05.249 --> 00:55:07.665 align:middle line:84%
>> PARKYN: Well, we can tell
you about a family situation,

00:55:07.665 --> 00:55:09.040 align:middle line:90%
if you will.

00:55:09.040 --> 00:55:10.930 align:middle line:84%
There was a family
that came to us.

00:55:10.930 --> 00:55:13.550 align:middle line:90%
They had a son who was--

00:55:13.550 --> 00:55:14.350 align:middle line:90%
what can I say?

00:55:14.350 --> 00:55:15.370 align:middle line:90%
He was in distress.

00:55:15.370 --> 00:55:16.540 align:middle line:90%
He was a troublemaker.

00:55:16.540 --> 00:55:18.140 align:middle line:84%
He went to school,
it was a disaster.

00:55:18.140 --> 00:55:19.940 align:middle line:90%
He went home, it was a disaster.

00:55:19.940 --> 00:55:23.057 align:middle line:84%
It was like causing
chaos everywhere.

00:55:23.057 --> 00:55:24.640 align:middle line:84%
And they'd been to
all the counselors,

00:55:24.640 --> 00:55:28.240 align:middle line:84%
and the psychologists, and
the doctors, and everybody.

00:55:28.240 --> 00:55:30.430 align:middle line:84%
And finally, I wouldn't
say in desperation,

00:55:30.430 --> 00:55:32.060 align:middle line:90%
but they came to us and said--

00:55:32.060 --> 00:55:32.560 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: In desperation.

00:55:32.560 --> 00:55:34.750 align:middle line:84%
>> PARKYN: --can you tell
us what the story is here?

00:55:34.750 --> 00:55:38.860 align:middle line:84%
So Carola and I, we look at the
charts of the family, and then

00:55:38.860 --> 00:55:39.760 align:middle line:90%
this little boy.

00:55:39.760 --> 00:55:41.510 align:middle line:84%
>> EASTWOOD: --because they
have two other children,

00:55:41.510 --> 00:55:42.310 align:middle line:90%
two daughters.

00:55:42.310 --> 00:55:43.270 align:middle line:90%
>> PARKYN: Certainly.

00:55:43.270 --> 00:55:45.640 align:middle line:84%
And for us, it's
like, yes, we can see

00:55:45.640 --> 00:55:47.680 align:middle line:90%
exactly what's going on here.

00:55:47.680 --> 00:55:50.590 align:middle line:84%
This child is living in a
family where all these energy

00:55:50.590 --> 00:55:52.120 align:middle line:90%
types live.

00:55:52.120 --> 00:55:54.040 align:middle line:84%
And this child is a
very sensitive being.

00:55:54.040 --> 00:55:57.390 align:middle line:84%
He's a projector,
and he needs space.

00:55:57.390 --> 00:55:58.190 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Right.

00:55:58.190 --> 00:55:59.280 align:middle line:84%
>> PARKYN: He
needs his own room.

00:55:59.280 --> 00:55:59.780 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Yes.

00:55:59.780 --> 00:56:01.370 align:middle line:90%
>> PARKYN: He needs time apart.

00:56:01.370 --> 00:56:03.620 align:middle line:84%
And when you shout out
dinnertime, it's up to him

00:56:03.620 --> 00:56:05.890 align:middle line:90%
whether he comes or not.

00:56:05.890 --> 00:56:08.130 align:middle line:84%
Make it worth his while
to come to dinner.

00:56:08.130 --> 00:56:08.930 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Right.

00:56:08.930 --> 00:56:12.080 align:middle line:84%
>> PARKYN: And so, we made a
few simple recommendations.

00:56:12.080 --> 00:56:14.650 align:middle line:84%
Give him a bit of
space, don't expect

00:56:14.650 --> 00:56:17.840 align:middle line:84%
him to operate like everybody
else in the family here.

00:56:17.840 --> 00:56:21.210 align:middle line:84%
And we heard about two weeks
later, everything had changed.

00:56:21.210 --> 00:56:22.460 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Isn't that amazing?

00:56:22.460 --> 00:56:23.375 align:middle line:90%
Something so simple.

00:56:23.375 --> 00:56:25.250 align:middle line:84%
>> EASTWOOD: He stopped
acting out in school.

00:56:25.250 --> 00:56:27.165 align:middle line:90%
He stopped being a problem.

00:56:27.165 --> 00:56:28.790 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: Well, I
can understand that.

00:56:28.790 --> 00:56:32.870 align:middle line:84%
As a projector, you can become
so overwhelmed with everybody's

00:56:32.870 --> 00:56:34.760 align:middle line:90%
energy, just stop it, you know?

00:56:34.760 --> 00:56:35.974 align:middle line:90%
Just stop it.

00:56:35.974 --> 00:56:37.640 align:middle line:84%
It's too much, you
know, especially when

00:56:37.640 --> 00:56:39.540 align:middle line:84%
so much is coming
at you all the time,

00:56:39.540 --> 00:56:42.450 align:middle line:84%
you just want to basically
kind of run away from it

00:56:42.450 --> 00:56:43.830 align:middle line:90%
however you can.

00:56:43.830 --> 00:56:45.996 align:middle line:84%
>> EASTWOOD: Yeah, and he
was steeped in it at home.

00:56:45.996 --> 00:56:47.750 align:middle line:84%
He was steeped in it
at school, you know,

00:56:47.750 --> 00:56:50.510 align:middle line:84%
and no one knew
to help him, just

00:56:50.510 --> 00:56:54.440 align:middle line:84%
give him his own room, and his
own space, and his own time--

00:56:54.440 --> 00:56:56.090 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: --to
think and just be.

00:56:56.090 --> 00:56:58.490 align:middle line:84%
>> EASTWOOD: Yeah, so that
he could integrate all those

00:56:58.490 --> 00:56:59.510 align:middle line:90%
experiences.

00:56:59.510 --> 00:57:01.940 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: Well, that's like
a little mini miracle in that

00:57:01.940 --> 00:57:02.740 align:middle line:90%
family.

00:57:02.740 --> 00:57:05.600 align:middle line:90%
It helped save the kid himself.

00:57:05.600 --> 00:57:09.230 align:middle line:90%
Yeah, no, I love that.

00:57:09.230 --> 00:57:13.230 align:middle line:84%
You know, to me, like I
said from the beginning,

00:57:13.230 --> 00:57:16.790 align:middle line:84%
it would be so painful to
not have that understanding

00:57:16.790 --> 00:57:20.060 align:middle line:90%
from early on in life.

00:57:20.060 --> 00:57:23.130 align:middle line:84%
So let's talk about
the book itself,

00:57:23.130 --> 00:57:24.459 align:middle line:90%
and kind of how you use it.

00:57:24.459 --> 00:57:26.000 align:middle line:84%
We only have about
five minutes left,

00:57:26.000 --> 00:57:27.230 align:middle line:84%
so we'll get to
the nuts and bolts

00:57:27.230 --> 00:57:28.604 align:middle line:84%
because I highly
encourage people

00:57:28.604 --> 00:57:30.930 align:middle line:84%
to get the book because
it's functional, useful,

00:57:30.930 --> 00:57:32.720 align:middle line:90%
and you can look everybody up.

00:57:32.720 --> 00:57:34.680 align:middle line:84%
Put in all their
data and then see.

00:57:34.680 --> 00:57:35.050 align:middle line:90%
>> EASTWOOD: It's a lot of fun.

00:57:35.050 --> 00:57:35.330 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: It's fun.

00:57:35.330 --> 00:57:36.180 align:middle line:90%
It's just really fun.

00:57:36.180 --> 00:57:37.055 align:middle line:90%
It's fun for a group.

00:57:37.055 --> 00:57:38.120 align:middle line:90%
It's fun for families.

00:57:38.120 --> 00:57:42.660 align:middle line:84%
It's fun for friends,
spouses, and so forth.

00:57:42.660 --> 00:57:44.360 align:middle line:84%
So how do you
initially use the book?

00:57:44.360 --> 00:57:45.410 align:middle line:90%
How is it designed?

00:57:45.410 --> 00:57:48.230 align:middle line:84%
>> PARKYN: Well, we describe
it as a coffee table book.

00:57:48.230 --> 00:57:51.862 align:middle line:84%
This really can be an opener
for all kinds of interactions.

00:57:51.862 --> 00:57:52.820 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: It sure can.

00:57:52.820 --> 00:57:55.530 align:middle line:84%

people can find out their life

00:57:55.530 --> 00:57:56.330 align:middle line:90%

00:57:56.330 --> 00:57:57.470 align:middle line:90%
They can go on our website.

00:57:57.470 --> 00:57:59.830 align:middle line:84%
They can download
their free report.

00:57:59.830 --> 00:58:01.700 align:middle line:84%
And listed in their
report is going

00:58:01.700 --> 00:58:04.340 align:middle line:84%
to be the name of
their life theme.

00:58:04.340 --> 00:58:06.350 align:middle line:84%

design for all, right?

00:58:06.350 --> 00:58:08.132 align:middle line:84%

00:58:09.590 --> 00:58:10.610 align:middle line:10%

00:58:10.610 --> 00:58:12.650 align:middle line:10%
>> REGINA: Yeah, and
it's really accessible.

00:58:12.650 --> 00:58:14.340 align:middle line:84%
You don't have to put in
a credit card or anything,

00:58:14.340 --> 00:58:16.800 align:middle line:84%
you can just put your data in,
and boom, you're good to go.

00:58:16.800 --> 00:58:17.600 align:middle line:90%
>> PARKYN: Yeah.

00:58:17.600 --> 00:58:19.580 align:middle line:84%
There's also an app
that we've built.

00:58:19.580 --> 00:58:23.030 align:middle line:10%
And I would say
thehumandesignapp.com.

00:58:23.030 --> 00:58:26.120 align:middle line:10%
If you go on that site, you'll
be directed to either Android

00:58:26.120 --> 00:58:30.910 align:middle line:10%
or iPhone, tablet,
however you like it.

00:58:30.910 --> 00:58:32.290 align:middle line:90%
And there's a free app there.

00:58:32.290 --> 00:58:36.460 align:middle line:84%
That app will also calculate
your life theme for you.

00:58:36.460 --> 00:58:39.070 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: Yes, OK, so you
made it really easy for people.

00:58:39.070 --> 00:58:40.397 align:middle line:90%
>> PARKYN: That's our pleasure.

00:58:40.397 --> 00:58:41.371 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Yes, yes.

00:58:41.371 --> 00:58:42.913 align:middle line:84%
>> EASTWOOD: Human
design for us all.

00:58:42.913 --> 00:58:45.454 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: And so then, you can
go to the number in the book,

00:58:45.454 --> 00:58:46.900 align:middle line:90%
it'll just catalogue there.

00:58:46.900 --> 00:58:49.120 align:middle line:84%
And you have a
page or two on each

00:58:49.120 --> 00:58:51.170 align:middle line:84%
of these themes,
these life themes.

00:58:51.170 --> 00:58:52.360 align:middle line:90%
>> PARKYN: 192 different.

00:58:52.360 --> 00:58:53.830 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: 192 life themes.

00:58:53.830 --> 00:58:56.770 align:middle line:84%
And since the book has come
out, what kind of reflection

00:58:56.770 --> 00:58:59.990 align:middle line:84%
are you getting back from the
public about its usefulness,

00:58:59.990 --> 00:59:00.790 align:middle line:90%
so to speak?

00:59:00.790 --> 00:59:03.081 align:middle line:84%
This is kind of a little
salesy pitch time if you want,

00:59:03.081 --> 00:59:05.005 align:middle line:90%
because I happen to love it.

00:59:05.005 --> 00:59:06.880 align:middle line:84%
>> PARKYN: Carola was
just saying, sometimes,

00:59:06.880 --> 00:59:09.580 align:middle line:84%
I will read somebody's
life theme to them.

00:59:09.580 --> 00:59:12.460 align:middle line:10%
And I will hear absolute silence
on the other end of the phone

00:59:12.460 --> 00:59:14.170 align:middle line:10%
or on Skype or wherever.

00:59:14.170 --> 00:59:15.790 align:middle line:84%
Or if somebody is
with me, I'll just

00:59:15.790 --> 00:59:17.640 align:middle line:84%
see tears coming
down their face.

00:59:17.640 --> 00:59:19.934 align:middle line:90%
It's like, finally, finally.

00:59:19.934 --> 00:59:21.850 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: Do most people
recognize it inside,

00:59:21.850 --> 00:59:22.820 align:middle line:90%
their heart recognizes it?

00:59:22.820 --> 00:59:24.111 align:middle line:90%
>> PARKYN: They can't avoid it.

00:59:24.111 --> 00:59:25.330 align:middle line:90%
It's on target.

00:59:25.330 --> 00:59:27.310 align:middle line:84%
As I say, we spent 20
years writing this book.

00:59:27.310 --> 00:59:28.110 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Yeah.

00:59:28.110 --> 00:59:29.980 align:middle line:84%
>> PARKYN: We put
everything into it.

00:59:29.980 --> 00:59:31.180 align:middle line:90%
And it's on target.

00:59:31.180 --> 00:59:32.980 align:middle line:84%
And everybody comes
back and says,

00:59:32.980 --> 00:59:34.771 align:middle line:84%
how come I didn't
know this before?

00:59:34.771 --> 00:59:35.770 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Right, right.

00:59:35.770 --> 00:59:38.160 align:middle line:84%
That's what I find
beautiful about it.

00:59:38.160 --> 00:59:40.240 align:middle line:84%
So any final thoughts
you'd like to share

00:59:40.240 --> 00:59:42.950 align:middle line:90%
with us before we say goodbye?

00:59:42.950 --> 00:59:48.140 align:middle line:10%
>> EASTWOOD: Well, I think
discovering our destiny path is

00:59:48.140 --> 00:59:52.010 align:middle line:10%
something that if we weren't
so conditioned in life,

00:59:52.010 --> 00:59:55.970 align:middle line:10%
if we didn't live a life
that was so off path and off

00:59:55.970 --> 01:00:00.440 align:middle line:10%
purpose, and fraught with
difficulties, we wouldn't ever,

01:00:00.440 --> 01:00:04.340 align:middle line:10%
as children, have gotten
so far from our truth.

01:00:04.340 --> 01:00:06.450 align:middle line:84%
Every child is born
with this knowing.

01:00:06.450 --> 01:00:11.000 align:middle line:84%
And every child is naturally
living out their destiny path.

01:00:11.000 --> 01:00:13.500 align:middle line:90%
It's just that we get off path.

01:00:13.500 --> 01:00:16.850 align:middle line:84%
And even if we get
just a little off path,

01:00:16.850 --> 01:00:19.880 align:middle line:84%
the further we keep
going off path,

01:00:19.880 --> 01:00:22.010 align:middle line:84%
the bigger the divide
is and the harder it

01:00:22.010 --> 01:00:25.070 align:middle line:84%
is to get back to who
we essentially are,

01:00:25.070 --> 01:00:28.490 align:middle line:84%
what we came here to
be, to do, to express

01:00:28.490 --> 01:00:31.490 align:middle line:84%
as a fulfillment of
our soul's destiny.

01:00:31.490 --> 01:00:33.876 align:middle line:84%
Because we're on an
evolutionary planet.

01:00:33.876 --> 01:00:35.500 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: It's so
much more efficient.

01:00:35.500 --> 01:00:36.780 align:middle line:90%
It just focused your energy.

01:00:36.780 --> 01:00:38.321 align:middle line:84%
>> EASTWOOD: It just
helps us, right.

01:00:38.321 --> 01:00:42.620 align:middle line:84%
And it could save us years,
decades of time and pain.

01:00:42.620 --> 01:00:44.000 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Absolutely.

01:00:44.000 --> 01:00:46.700 align:middle line:84%
And you know, some of it we
recognize in our own children,

01:00:46.700 --> 01:00:48.408 align:middle line:84%
but we don't even know
what we're saying.

01:00:48.408 --> 01:00:50.990 align:middle line:84%
And I think even my own
case, as a little tiny one,

01:00:50.990 --> 01:00:54.352 align:middle line:84%
a little toddler, my dad
used to call me wagon wheel.

01:00:54.352 --> 01:00:56.810 align:middle line:84%
And I thought wagon wheel, why
did you call me wagon wheel?

01:00:56.810 --> 01:00:59.120 align:middle line:84%
He said, because you
were a little know-it-all

01:00:59.120 --> 01:01:00.230 align:middle line:90%
before I could even speak.

01:01:00.230 --> 01:01:02.167 align:middle line:84%
It seemed like you'd
been around 1,000 times

01:01:02.167 --> 01:01:03.500 align:middle line:90%
and you already knew everything.

01:01:03.500 --> 01:01:04.954 align:middle line:90%
So he called you wagon wheel.

01:01:04.954 --> 01:01:06.120 align:middle line:90%
In other words, know-it-all.

01:01:08.420 --> 01:01:13.580 align:middle line:84%
So he recognized it, but I
didn't find it out till later.

01:01:13.580 --> 01:01:16.010 align:middle line:90%
Any final thoughts, Chetan?

01:01:16.010 --> 01:01:17.770 align:middle line:90%
>> PARKYN: Life is a mystery.

01:01:17.770 --> 01:01:20.840 align:middle line:84%
And the more we can appreciate
that, the greater experience

01:01:20.840 --> 01:01:23.000 align:middle line:90%
we're going to have.

01:01:23.000 --> 01:01:25.370 align:middle line:84%

gift for the world.

And honestly, more than
ever in these times,

01:01:33.120 --> 01:01:35.910 align:middle line:84%
we need to know who we
are, what we're about,

01:01:35.910 --> 01:01:38.850 align:middle line:84%
and how to be fulfilled
in life, in a way that

01:01:38.850 --> 01:01:42.120 align:middle line:84%
is not dependent on
anybody or anything else.

01:01:42.120 --> 01:01:45.520 align:middle line:84%
Fulfilled from the inside,
and that's what we do.

01:01:45.520 --> 01:01:48.097 align:middle line:84%
That's what human design, that's
what our work is all about.
