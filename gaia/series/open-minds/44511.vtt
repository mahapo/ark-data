00:00:27.799 --> 00:00:30.090 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA MEREDITH: Many of
you may have read the story

00:00:30.090 --> 00:00:32.340 align:middle line:84%
of the Peaceful
Warrior by Dan Millman.

00:00:32.340 --> 00:00:34.620 align:middle line:84%
A movie was ultimately
made on his story, which

00:00:34.620 --> 00:00:37.230 align:middle line:84%
continued to inspire
millions of people.

00:00:37.230 --> 00:00:37.730 align:middle line:90%
Why?

00:00:37.730 --> 00:00:40.150 align:middle line:84%
Because deep inside,
most of us wish

00:00:40.150 --> 00:00:43.230 align:middle line:84%
we had a wise sage to guide
us through life's mysteries

00:00:43.230 --> 00:00:44.640 align:middle line:90%
and challenges.

00:00:44.640 --> 00:00:47.240 align:middle line:84%
David Christopher's new
book, "The Holy Universe,"

00:00:47.240 --> 00:00:50.390 align:middle line:84%
offers us this level of insights
through a Sage and Seeker

00:00:50.390 --> 00:00:51.200 align:middle line:90%
story.

00:00:51.200 --> 00:00:54.630 align:middle line:84%
The insights shared are filled
with grace and deep truth.

00:00:54.630 --> 00:00:56.450 align:middle line:84%
It's called a book
for the spiritual,

00:00:56.450 --> 00:00:59.320 align:middle line:84%
but not necessarily
for the religious.

00:00:59.320 --> 00:01:02.940 align:middle line:84%
And that comes up again and
again reading about this book.

00:01:02.940 --> 00:01:06.250 align:middle line:84%
People who've let their
religions of youth

00:01:06.250 --> 00:01:08.930 align:middle line:84%
go, because they were
disillusioned or disappointed

00:01:08.930 --> 00:01:11.420 align:middle line:84%
in some of the dogma
or whatnot, are still

00:01:11.420 --> 00:01:13.850 align:middle line:84%
finding this gap in
themselves of something

00:01:13.850 --> 00:01:15.880 align:middle line:90%
that is more transcendent.

00:01:15.880 --> 00:01:18.917 align:middle line:84%
And it sounds like
that's your own story.

00:01:18.917 --> 00:01:20.000 align:middle line:90%
>> DAVID CHRISTOPHER: Yes.

00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:26.650 align:middle line:84%
I was looking for a story,
almost a holy story.

00:01:26.650 --> 00:01:29.500 align:middle line:84%
And after discovering
Brian Swimme's work

00:01:29.500 --> 00:01:32.830 align:middle line:84%
and Thomas Berry's work,
and Sister Miriam MacGillis,

00:01:32.830 --> 00:01:34.490 align:middle line:84%
and many other people
who are telling

00:01:34.490 --> 00:01:38.780 align:middle line:84%
this new scientific story
of creation, I loved it.

00:01:38.780 --> 00:01:39.450 align:middle line:90%
I loved it.

00:01:39.450 --> 00:01:43.970 align:middle line:84%
I took it all in and drank
so deeply from that well.

00:01:43.970 --> 00:01:47.100 align:middle line:84%
But then I found there was
part of me that wanted more.

00:01:47.100 --> 00:01:50.730 align:middle line:84%
I wanted more of the
scriptures that I grew up with.

00:01:50.730 --> 00:01:55.300 align:middle line:84%
And so not seeing any,
and getting encouragement

00:01:55.300 --> 00:01:58.420 align:middle line:84%
from others to go ahead
and write this story,

00:01:58.420 --> 00:02:00.070 align:middle line:84%
I went ahead and
wrote the story.

00:02:00.070 --> 00:02:02.250 align:middle line:84%
And it felt a little
audacious-- it still

00:02:02.250 --> 00:02:05.852 align:middle line:84%
feels a little audacious--
but it is a story of creation,

00:02:05.852 --> 00:02:08.060 align:middle line:84%
and all the way up from the
beginning of the universe

00:02:08.060 --> 00:02:09.086 align:middle line:90%
to present-day Earth.

00:02:09.086 --> 00:02:10.669 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: It does
have an awful lot--

00:02:10.669 --> 00:02:12.470 align:middle line:84%
as I said when I
introduced you--

00:02:12.470 --> 00:02:14.410 align:middle line:84%
a lot of depth and
a lot of wisdom.

00:02:14.410 --> 00:02:17.390 align:middle line:84%
And this is an area that
I've been profoundly

00:02:17.390 --> 00:02:22.070 align:middle line:84%
interested in for many years,
and as a result of interactions

00:02:22.070 --> 00:02:24.900 align:middle line:84%
with a being that I
hold very dear, who

00:02:24.900 --> 00:02:30.600 align:middle line:84%
told me, 30 years ago,
a revelatory version

00:02:30.600 --> 00:02:33.570 align:middle line:84%
of the process of
creation in the universe,

00:02:33.570 --> 00:02:36.860 align:middle line:84%
and into the earthly level
in realms, and the people,

00:02:36.860 --> 00:02:37.490 align:middle line:90%
and so forth.

00:02:37.490 --> 00:02:40.890 align:middle line:84%
So I'm always looking
for pixels of information

00:02:40.890 --> 00:02:45.800 align:middle line:84%
that overlay that and have
some similar truths to see

00:02:45.800 --> 00:02:48.050 align:middle line:84%
where the depth
is in that story.

00:02:48.050 --> 00:02:50.730 align:middle line:84%
>> CHRISTOPHER: Yeah, and it's
also a very physical story,

00:02:50.730 --> 00:02:53.890 align:middle line:84%
too, in that it takes
the physical science--

00:02:53.890 --> 00:02:55.790 align:middle line:84%
the best that science
has right now--

00:02:55.790 --> 00:02:58.830 align:middle line:84%
and it uses that as a
foundation to tell the story.

00:02:58.830 --> 00:03:01.980 align:middle line:84%
And then it goes into
some of the spirituality

00:03:01.980 --> 00:03:05.370 align:middle line:84%
that many of us
are familiar with.

00:03:05.370 --> 00:03:09.076 align:middle line:84%
But it really-- I also want
to bring that concreteness

00:03:09.076 --> 00:03:13.580 align:middle line:84%
of the physics, the astronomy,
and the chemistry, the biology,

00:03:13.580 --> 00:03:19.234 align:middle line:84%
and then even the anthropology
that is part of our truth, too.

00:03:19.234 --> 00:03:21.650 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: Yes, and that's
really important at this stage.

00:03:21.650 --> 00:03:24.360 align:middle line:84%
And there's one line that
keeps occurring over and over

00:03:24.360 --> 00:03:27.990 align:middle line:84%
in the book that we'll talk
about in a little bit, that

00:03:27.990 --> 00:03:31.340 align:middle line:84%
is really where the bridge
between spirituality

00:03:31.340 --> 00:03:36.200 align:middle line:84%
and science starts manifesting
itself in this work.

00:03:36.200 --> 00:03:40.830 align:middle line:84%
And a few years ago, I
interviewed Bernard Haisch.

00:03:40.830 --> 00:03:42.290 align:middle line:90%
I think it's "The God Theory."

00:03:42.290 --> 00:03:45.950 align:middle line:84%
And essentially
this has been what's

00:03:45.950 --> 00:03:50.110 align:middle line:84%
been emerging the last 10
years, above all other stories,

00:03:50.110 --> 00:03:53.440 align:middle line:84%
is that these scientists are
having this breakthrough of how

00:03:53.440 --> 00:03:57.400 align:middle line:84%
did our reality
construct itself?

00:03:57.400 --> 00:03:59.517 align:middle line:90%
How can this be random?

00:03:59.517 --> 00:04:00.350 align:middle line:90%
>> CHRISTOPHER: Yes.

00:04:00.350 --> 00:04:02.450 align:middle line:84%
And that line, "as if it
knew what it was doing."

00:04:02.450 --> 00:04:04.450 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: "As If it
knew what it was doing."

00:04:04.450 --> 00:04:07.510 align:middle line:84%
>> CHRISTOPHER: Yeah, and it's
interesting that the Seeker

00:04:07.510 --> 00:04:10.920 align:middle line:84%
actually asked, what
do you mean by that?

00:04:10.920 --> 00:04:14.400 align:middle line:84%
And the answer
that the Sage gives

00:04:14.400 --> 00:04:20.769 align:middle line:84%
is-- the Sage gives the
idea of the infinite,

00:04:20.769 --> 00:04:25.040 align:middle line:84%
and uses that as the word to
describe ultimate reality,

00:04:25.040 --> 00:04:28.170 align:middle line:84%
or even better, the creative
force of the infinite.

00:04:28.170 --> 00:04:31.960 align:middle line:84%
Because the idea of God, or all
the names that we have for God

00:04:31.960 --> 00:04:35.180 align:middle line:84%
are just almost small
shadowy, egoic images

00:04:35.180 --> 00:04:37.690 align:middle line:84%
that don't even
begin to illuminate

00:04:37.690 --> 00:04:40.289 align:middle line:84%
the grandeur of this
creative process.

00:04:40.289 --> 00:04:42.330 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: And no one
takes exception to the word

00:04:42.330 --> 00:04:43.450 align:middle line:90%
"creative" force.

00:04:43.450 --> 00:04:44.915 align:middle line:84%
>> CHRISTOPHER:
Yes, yes, exactly.

00:04:44.915 --> 00:04:46.310 align:middle line:90%
And scientists don't.

00:04:46.310 --> 00:04:49.420 align:middle line:84%
I mean, it really is behaving--
from the very beginning

00:04:49.420 --> 00:04:51.040 align:middle line:84%
of the universe,
it is behaving as

00:04:51.040 --> 00:04:53.420 align:middle line:84%
if it knows exactly
what it's doing.

00:04:53.420 --> 00:04:57.370 align:middle line:84%
So even someone who is a
very strong atheist, who

00:04:57.370 --> 00:05:00.740 align:middle line:84%
doesn't believe in that
spiritual side of things,

00:05:00.740 --> 00:05:02.430 align:middle line:90%
can't argue with that.

00:05:02.430 --> 00:05:05.770 align:middle line:84%
Because the universe
is so finely tuned.

00:05:05.770 --> 00:05:08.559 align:middle line:84%
The expansion of the
universe was so precise,

00:05:08.559 --> 00:05:10.225 align:middle line:84%
that if it was just
a little bit slower,

00:05:10.225 --> 00:05:13.220 align:middle line:84%
it would collapse
back into itself.

00:05:13.220 --> 00:05:14.980 align:middle line:84%
And it was a little
bit faster, it

00:05:14.980 --> 00:05:17.670 align:middle line:84%
would have spun out and
dissipated into nothingness,

00:05:17.670 --> 00:05:20.730 align:middle line:84%
and never would have created
stars and planets and us.

00:05:20.730 --> 00:05:23.760 align:middle line:84%
So that was an interesting
line that came to me.

00:05:23.760 --> 00:05:26.200 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: Yeah, I
really liked that,

00:05:26.200 --> 00:05:28.490 align:middle line:84%
because the book is written
almost in the form, well,

00:05:28.490 --> 00:05:29.920 align:middle line:90%
of poetry.

00:05:29.920 --> 00:05:33.870 align:middle line:84%
It was very appropriately
used in that context.

00:05:33.870 --> 00:05:36.099 align:middle line:84%
And it made the book very
readable, too, I must say.

00:05:36.099 --> 00:05:37.890 align:middle line:84%
And that's why I wanted
to talk about this,

00:05:37.890 --> 00:05:40.370 align:middle line:84%
because the notion
of using poetry

00:05:40.370 --> 00:05:42.390 align:middle line:84%
to tell these deeper
stories, other

00:05:42.390 --> 00:05:45.689 align:middle line:84%
than just pure classical
poetry and such,

00:05:45.689 --> 00:05:46.730 align:middle line:90%
has not really been done.

00:05:46.730 --> 00:05:49.150 align:middle line:84%
This is still done in quite
a linear fashion, a very

00:05:49.150 --> 00:05:52.990 align:middle line:84%
understandable fashion, but
still has that grace to it

00:05:52.990 --> 00:05:56.535 align:middle line:84%
that a lengthy, lengthy
poem would have.

00:05:56.535 --> 00:05:59.037 align:middle line:84%
And so I congratulate you on
what you were able to do--

00:05:59.037 --> 00:06:00.120 align:middle line:90%
>> CHRISTOPHER: Thank you.

00:06:00.120 --> 00:06:01.078 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: --with this.

00:06:01.078 --> 00:06:04.100 align:middle line:84%
And yes, that whole
notion of this,

00:06:04.100 --> 00:06:06.980 align:middle line:84%
if it were just a little too
hot, we wouldn't be here.

00:06:06.980 --> 00:06:08.230 align:middle line:90%
This is interesting.

00:06:08.230 --> 00:06:11.190 align:middle line:84%
>> CHRISTOPHER: If the moon were
just a little bit further away,

00:06:11.190 --> 00:06:15.530 align:middle line:84%
if the asteroid that hit
Earth billions of years ago,

00:06:15.530 --> 00:06:20.580 align:middle line:84%
as she was forming, had tilted
it just a little bit too much,

00:06:20.580 --> 00:06:21.789 align:middle line:90%
we wouldn't have the seasons.

00:06:21.789 --> 00:06:24.413 align:middle line:84%
And who knows if life would have
been able to evolve in the way

00:06:24.413 --> 00:06:24.920 align:middle line:90%
it did.

00:06:24.920 --> 00:06:27.760 align:middle line:84%
Just so many things
are so finely tuned

00:06:27.760 --> 00:06:30.042 align:middle line:84%
that it just-- it's
an amazing story.

00:06:30.042 --> 00:06:30.750 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: It is.

00:06:30.750 --> 00:06:33.790 align:middle line:84%
And before we go,
I'll start going

00:06:33.790 --> 00:06:35.310 align:middle line:84%
through the first
part of the book.

00:06:35.310 --> 00:06:37.090 align:middle line:84%
Because it's a
Seeker Sage, right?

00:06:37.090 --> 00:06:37.923 align:middle line:90%
>> CHRISTOPHER: Yes.

00:06:37.923 --> 00:06:43.280 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: And so the Sage is
giving the Seeker some very

00:06:43.280 --> 00:06:45.370 align:middle line:84%
simple principles to
begin working with,

00:06:45.370 --> 00:06:49.040 align:middle line:84%
which is really to reveal how
disconnected we've become from

00:06:49.040 --> 00:06:51.540 align:middle line:84%
each other and ourselves,
how afraid we are.

00:06:51.540 --> 00:06:53.040 align:middle line:84%
And one of the
simple little things

00:06:53.040 --> 00:06:56.470 align:middle line:84%
she said to do within this--
to the man who was the Seeker--

00:06:56.470 --> 00:06:59.770 align:middle line:90%
was to go to an event.

00:06:59.770 --> 00:07:01.312 align:middle line:84%
And he had a birthday
party to go to.

00:07:01.312 --> 00:07:02.145 align:middle line:90%
>> CHRISTOPHER: Yes.

00:07:02.145 --> 00:07:03.270 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Go to an event.

00:07:03.270 --> 00:07:06.970 align:middle line:84%
And instead of doing things
the normal way, why don't you

00:07:06.970 --> 00:07:09.090 align:middle line:84%
see if you can inspire
it so that everyone

00:07:09.090 --> 00:07:13.530 align:middle line:84%
tell a little story about the
person that's being celebrated.

00:07:13.530 --> 00:07:15.080 align:middle line:90%
And so let's talk about that.

00:07:15.080 --> 00:07:17.590 align:middle line:84%
Why did you choose to put
that in toward the beginning

00:07:17.590 --> 00:07:18.090 align:middle line:90%
of the book?

00:07:18.090 --> 00:07:20.960 align:middle line:84%
>> CHRISTOPHER: Well, one of my
early readers pointed out that

00:07:20.960 --> 00:07:24.112 align:middle line:84%
you're talking about story,
but you're not telling a story.

00:07:24.112 --> 00:07:26.320 align:middle line:84%
So why don't you, instead
of talking about the story,

00:07:26.320 --> 00:07:28.680 align:middle line:84%
tell the story of
this birthday, and go

00:07:28.680 --> 00:07:31.530 align:middle line:90%
into the characters and whatnot.

00:07:31.530 --> 00:07:37.430 align:middle line:84%
And I actually lived
this when I graduated

00:07:37.430 --> 00:07:39.350 align:middle line:90%
from my master's program.

00:07:39.350 --> 00:07:42.520 align:middle line:84%
We were supposed to tell the
story of what we learned.

00:07:42.520 --> 00:07:45.970 align:middle line:84%
And we had a number of
things-- what have you learned?

00:07:45.970 --> 00:07:47.330 align:middle line:90%
How does it apply to your life?

00:07:47.330 --> 00:07:49.550 align:middle line:84%
Where are you're going to
go next on your journey?

00:07:49.550 --> 00:07:51.510 align:middle line:90%
And I used that as the template.

00:07:51.510 --> 00:07:53.390 align:middle line:84%
It was about a
three-hour presentation

00:07:53.390 --> 00:07:56.660 align:middle line:84%
that you gave to your peers
and to some of your professors.

00:07:56.660 --> 00:07:58.040 align:middle line:84%
And that's where
I first realized

00:07:58.040 --> 00:08:00.900 align:middle line:84%
how important to be able
to tell your story is.

00:08:00.900 --> 00:08:03.910 align:middle line:84%
If we don't have a
chance to tell our story,

00:08:03.910 --> 00:08:09.170 align:middle line:84%
that's where I feel a lot of
celebrations begin to miss out.

00:08:09.170 --> 00:08:14.500 align:middle line:84%
And so from that
experience, I did a couple

00:08:14.500 --> 00:08:17.500 align:middle line:84%
of birthday parties,
where we had

00:08:17.500 --> 00:08:20.530 align:middle line:84%
just small stories about-- tell
what you like about the person.

00:08:20.530 --> 00:08:24.110 align:middle line:84%
Tell a small story about what
you like about the person.

00:08:24.110 --> 00:08:27.010 align:middle line:84%
And so that was the
model that I used.

00:08:27.010 --> 00:08:28.510 align:middle line:84%
And that's what
came out in that.

00:08:28.510 --> 00:08:30.780 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: But people are
amazingly uncomfortable.

00:08:30.780 --> 00:08:32.770 align:middle line:84%
>> CHRISTOPHER:
They begin to be.

00:08:32.770 --> 00:08:34.650 align:middle line:84%
And then they start
to dive into it,

00:08:34.650 --> 00:08:37.740 align:middle line:84%
to the point where, if you're
not careful, it can just--

00:08:37.740 --> 00:08:40.610 align:middle line:84%
it's sort of like, if
they realize that this

00:08:40.610 --> 00:08:43.760 align:middle line:84%
is so meaningful and rich,
they don't want to stop.

00:08:43.760 --> 00:08:45.540 align:middle line:90%
And they can go on too long.

00:08:45.540 --> 00:08:47.570 align:middle line:84%
So I think the Sage
actually says at one point,

00:08:47.570 --> 00:08:49.778 align:middle line:84%
it's important to have to
structure so that you don't

00:08:49.778 --> 00:08:51.112 align:middle line:90%
begin to hear car keys jangling.

00:08:51.112 --> 00:08:51.819 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Right.

00:08:51.819 --> 00:08:53.890 align:middle line:84%
But it changes the dynamic
of the entire group,

00:08:53.890 --> 00:08:55.550 align:middle line:84%
and the quality
of the celebration

00:08:55.550 --> 00:08:58.230 align:middle line:84%
is completely
qualitatively different.

00:08:58.230 --> 00:09:02.010 align:middle line:84%
And what is the difference
there between, for example,

00:09:02.010 --> 00:09:07.790 align:middle line:84%
telling our story to each other,
versus being stuck in a story

00:09:07.790 --> 00:09:11.800 align:middle line:84%
and in essence
talking at each other?

00:09:11.800 --> 00:09:15.040 align:middle line:84%
>> CHRISTOPHER: The difference
between telling the story

00:09:15.040 --> 00:09:18.470 align:middle line:84%
and talking about it-- well,
actually that's part of what

00:09:18.470 --> 00:09:23.190 align:middle line:84%
the book gets into-- is the
larger stories of the cosmos,

00:09:23.190 --> 00:09:27.290 align:middle line:84%
and how they interrelate with
the stories we tell ourselves.

00:09:27.290 --> 00:09:31.490 align:middle line:84%
In fact, it was funny I was--
I believe you interviewed Joan

00:09:31.490 --> 00:09:34.430 align:middle line:84%
Borysenko about a
year, two years ago.

00:09:34.430 --> 00:09:35.880 align:middle line:84%
And she talked
about how important

00:09:35.880 --> 00:09:39.570 align:middle line:84%
it was to examine what
we tell ourselves.

00:09:39.570 --> 00:09:43.367 align:middle line:84%
And if we go
unconscious when we tell

00:09:43.367 --> 00:09:45.950 align:middle line:84%
the story, I think that's where
the difference is, where we're

00:09:45.950 --> 00:09:49.050 align:middle line:84%
automatically telling the
story, and not really thinking

00:09:49.050 --> 00:09:51.760 align:middle line:84%
about what we're saying and
what we're talking about,

00:09:51.760 --> 00:09:55.150 align:middle line:84%
versus telling the story
from a genuine place of this

00:09:55.150 --> 00:09:58.350 align:middle line:84%
is-- it's almost like I'm
there again in the situation

00:09:58.350 --> 00:09:59.220 align:middle line:90%
that I'm telling.

00:09:59.220 --> 00:09:59.900 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: Full
engagement, meaning.

00:09:59.900 --> 00:10:01.250 align:middle line:90%
>> CHRISTOPHER: Yes, yes.

00:10:01.250 --> 00:10:03.850 align:middle line:84%
So I think that's the
difference between the two.

00:10:03.850 --> 00:10:07.330 align:middle line:84%
>> DAVID CHRISTOPHER: So let's
talk about for you, personally,

00:10:07.330 --> 00:10:10.190 align:middle line:84%
there was something in your
life besides the spiritual part.

00:10:10.190 --> 00:10:15.780 align:middle line:84%
This is heavily focused on the
Earth's process of creation,

00:10:15.780 --> 00:10:17.430 align:middle line:90%
destruction, and so forth.

00:10:17.430 --> 00:10:20.380 align:middle line:84%
Was there something in
you, as a sensitive being,

00:10:20.380 --> 00:10:22.830 align:middle line:84%
that needed to have this
expression because there

00:10:22.830 --> 00:10:24.840 align:middle line:84%
was certain pain
in watching some

00:10:24.840 --> 00:10:27.470 align:middle line:90%
of what happens on the planet?

00:10:27.470 --> 00:10:31.880 align:middle line:84%
>> CHRISTOPHER: The first memory
I have of really caring about

00:10:31.880 --> 00:10:34.000 align:middle line:84%
this is when I was
eight years old.

00:10:34.000 --> 00:10:35.540 align:middle line:84%
And that's one of
the pieces that

00:10:35.540 --> 00:10:37.870 align:middle line:84%
was autobiographical
in the book,

00:10:37.870 --> 00:10:40.960 align:middle line:84%
is talking about
watching a television

00:10:40.960 --> 00:10:44.000 align:middle line:84%
show about the
extinction of species,

00:10:44.000 --> 00:10:47.450 align:middle line:90%
and becoming absolutely unglued.

00:10:47.450 --> 00:10:50.910 align:middle line:84%
And my siblings really
didn't-- they said, oh, well,

00:10:50.910 --> 00:10:52.100 align:middle line:90%
that's too bad.

00:10:52.100 --> 00:10:55.060 align:middle line:84%
And for some reason
it just tore me apart,

00:10:55.060 --> 00:10:57.090 align:middle line:84%
to the point where I
found out-- I ended up--

00:10:57.090 --> 00:10:59.570 align:middle line:84%
I was in my father's
arms, and sobbing.

00:10:59.570 --> 00:11:02.160 align:middle line:84%
And he was a person who
was-- like many people-- was

00:11:02.160 --> 00:11:04.770 align:middle line:84%
like, little boys
should not cry.

00:11:04.770 --> 00:11:07.240 align:middle line:84%
And yet there was so
much pain coming through

00:11:07.240 --> 00:11:09.560 align:middle line:90%
that he was a bit bewildered.

00:11:09.560 --> 00:11:16.610 align:middle line:84%
And so that was my first memory
of having that real caring

00:11:16.610 --> 00:11:18.850 align:middle line:84%
of something deep,
that there's something

00:11:18.850 --> 00:11:21.350 align:middle line:90%
going on here that isn't right.

00:11:21.350 --> 00:11:24.930 align:middle line:84%
And then after I left-- I was
raised in the Episcopal church.

00:11:24.930 --> 00:11:28.410 align:middle line:84%
And after I left the Episcopal
church, I kind of just

00:11:28.410 --> 00:11:31.980 align:middle line:84%
followed the modern mind way
of proceeding with life--

00:11:31.980 --> 00:11:35.070 align:middle line:84%
going to college
and getting a job,

00:11:35.070 --> 00:11:37.930 align:middle line:84%
but never quite
feeling like I fit in.

00:11:37.930 --> 00:11:41.680 align:middle line:84%
And at a certain
point, I was part

00:11:41.680 --> 00:11:45.636 align:middle line:84%
of a nonprofit organization
called the Pachamama Alliance.

00:11:45.636 --> 00:11:46.260 align:middle line:90%
And Pachamama--

00:11:46.260 --> 00:11:47.090 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Lynne Twist--

00:11:47.090 --> 00:11:48.705 align:middle line:84%
>> CHRISTOPHER: Yes, Lynne
Twist, and Bill Twist--

00:11:48.705 --> 00:11:49.050 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: John.

00:11:49.050 --> 00:11:50.560 align:middle line:90%
>> CHRISTOPHER: John Perkins.

00:11:50.560 --> 00:11:55.500 align:middle line:84%
And I loved how they
came into existence

00:11:55.500 --> 00:11:57.550 align:middle line:84%
by the call of the
rainforest, by the call

00:11:57.550 --> 00:11:59.990 align:middle line:90%
of the people of the rainforest.

00:11:59.990 --> 00:12:01.829 align:middle line:84%
But my experience
with them-- when

00:12:01.829 --> 00:12:04.120 align:middle line:84%
they have the Awakening the
Dream or Changing the Dream

00:12:04.120 --> 00:12:07.870 align:middle line:84%
symposium, and within that
particular symposium, they

00:12:07.870 --> 00:12:09.630 align:middle line:90%
tell the new story.

00:12:09.630 --> 00:12:12.617 align:middle line:84%
And that's what reawakened
my real desire to, ooh,

00:12:12.617 --> 00:12:14.700 align:middle line:84%
there's a story here that
really needs to be told,

00:12:14.700 --> 00:12:16.330 align:middle line:84%
and I want to learn
more about it.

00:12:16.330 --> 00:12:19.794 align:middle line:84%
And that's where this really
had its-- had its beginnings.

00:12:19.794 --> 00:12:21.710 align:middle line:84%
>> DAVID CHRISTOPHER:
Let's do something here.

00:12:21.710 --> 00:12:24.030 align:middle line:84%
Let's talk about
the creation story

00:12:24.030 --> 00:12:26.230 align:middle line:90%
as it's posed in this book.

00:12:26.230 --> 00:12:29.260 align:middle line:84%
And let's start with
the way this is set up.

00:12:29.260 --> 00:12:34.470 align:middle line:84%
And again, you're merging
science with spirituality.

00:12:34.470 --> 00:12:35.340 align:middle line:90%
>> CHRISTOPHER: Yes.

00:12:35.340 --> 00:12:39.380 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: And so start telling
us the story of how the Earth

00:12:39.380 --> 00:12:44.420 align:middle line:84%
was-- how the cosmos and
universe and the Earth itself,

00:12:44.420 --> 00:12:47.210 align:middle line:84%
how the formation of the
lifeforms that we see and are

00:12:47.210 --> 00:12:48.450 align:middle line:90%
familiar with occurred.

00:12:48.450 --> 00:12:49.908 align:middle line:84%
>> CHRISTOPHER: So
I can tell you--

00:12:49.908 --> 00:12:53.940 align:middle line:84%
there's about a two-minute
story I can tell you.

00:12:53.940 --> 00:12:58.370 align:middle line:84%
So it starts with the Seeker
and the Sage have been together.

00:12:58.370 --> 00:13:01.710 align:middle line:84%
And the Sage, at one
point, says, you know,

00:13:01.710 --> 00:13:04.680 align:middle line:84%
let's look at your-- you
need a foundational story.

00:13:04.680 --> 00:13:06.270 align:middle line:90%
Why don't we start with that?

00:13:06.270 --> 00:13:08.850 align:middle line:84%
And then we'll talk
about the other issues

00:13:08.850 --> 00:13:12.440 align:middle line:84%
that you have in
relation to that story.

00:13:12.440 --> 00:13:17.780 align:middle line:84%
So she begins with
this, and it's

00:13:17.780 --> 00:13:21.480 align:middle line:84%
entitled "The Infinite and
the Creation of the Cosmos."

00:13:21.480 --> 00:13:24.830 align:middle line:84%
"It was the beginning
of all beginnings.

00:13:24.830 --> 00:13:27.410 align:middle line:84%
It was a time of no
time, for time did not

00:13:27.410 --> 00:13:33.520 align:middle line:84%
exist, a place of no place,
for space did not exist.

00:13:33.520 --> 00:13:38.320 align:middle line:84%
It was a beginning like no
other, for there was no before.

00:13:38.320 --> 00:13:40.090 align:middle line:90%
There was no time.

00:13:40.090 --> 00:13:41.220 align:middle line:90%
There was no place.

00:13:41.220 --> 00:13:46.930 align:middle line:84%
There was only the infinite
and the unfathomable mystery.

00:13:46.930 --> 00:13:51.300 align:middle line:84%
And the unfathomable mystery
was all that was to be.

00:13:51.300 --> 00:13:53.550 align:middle line:84%
And all that was to
be was small, smaller

00:13:53.550 --> 00:13:57.520 align:middle line:84%
than the tiniest particle in
the tiniest atom in the tiniest

00:13:57.520 --> 00:14:01.170 align:middle line:84%
dream, although
there was nowhere

00:14:01.170 --> 00:14:05.130 align:middle line:84%
from which to see how small
all that was to be was.

00:14:05.130 --> 00:14:13.110 align:middle line:84%
For there was no outside and
no inside, no here, no there,

00:14:13.110 --> 00:14:20.370 align:middle line:84%
no now, and no then, no
darkness, and no light.

00:14:20.370 --> 00:14:25.040 align:middle line:84%
There was nothing, save a
whisper of what might be,

00:14:25.040 --> 00:14:31.570 align:middle line:84%
an infinitesimal, indescribable,
unfathomable mystery.

00:14:31.570 --> 00:14:33.600 align:middle line:84%
And out of the
unfathomable mystery

00:14:33.600 --> 00:14:36.620 align:middle line:84%
the infinite called
forth to itself.

00:14:36.620 --> 00:14:38.380 align:middle line:90%
It called forth space.

00:14:38.380 --> 00:14:40.280 align:middle line:90%
It called forth time.

00:14:40.280 --> 00:14:42.620 align:middle line:90%
It called forth being.

00:14:42.620 --> 00:14:44.720 align:middle line:84%
And in that ecstatic
instant, the universe

00:14:44.720 --> 00:14:46.950 align:middle line:84%
slammed exploding [BOOM]
outward into existence,

00:14:46.950 --> 00:14:49.500 align:middle line:84%
with all the jubilant
and breathtaking beauty,

00:14:49.500 --> 00:14:52.160 align:middle line:84%
brightness, energy,
violence, power,

00:14:52.160 --> 00:14:56.890 align:middle line:84%
and glory of a
trillion newborn stars.

00:14:56.890 --> 00:14:59.350 align:middle line:90%
It was a perfect explosion.

00:14:59.350 --> 00:15:02.340 align:middle line:84%
One trillionth of a second
slower, and the universe

00:15:02.340 --> 00:15:06.470 align:middle line:84%
would collapse back into
itself, unfulfilled.

00:15:06.470 --> 00:15:08.250 align:middle line:84%
One trillionth of
a second faster,

00:15:08.250 --> 00:15:11.070 align:middle line:84%
and the universe would spin out,
dissipating into nothingness,

00:15:11.070 --> 00:15:14.720 align:middle line:84%
never to create
galaxies, stars, planets,

00:15:14.720 --> 00:15:19.670 align:middle line:84%
life, nor us-- a
perfect explosion.

00:15:19.670 --> 00:15:22.920 align:middle line:84%
And in the instance of
this perfect explosion,

00:15:22.920 --> 00:15:25.710 align:middle line:84%
the infinite began a
brilliant and fierce cycle

00:15:25.710 --> 00:15:29.490 align:middle line:84%
of gloriously creating,
violently destroying,

00:15:29.490 --> 00:15:33.500 align:middle line:84%
and gloriously
creating once more,

00:15:33.500 --> 00:15:36.220 align:middle line:84%
as if it knew what
it was doing."

00:15:36.220 --> 00:15:39.140 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: Yes, as if it
knew what it was doing.

00:15:39.140 --> 00:15:43.230 align:middle line:84%
Let's talk about that
in the context of what

00:15:43.230 --> 00:15:46.690 align:middle line:84%
we're finding
ourself facing today.

00:15:46.690 --> 00:15:49.150 align:middle line:84%
Pachamama Alliance
is really very

00:15:49.150 --> 00:15:52.210 align:middle line:84%
active in helping us
understand the larger

00:15:52.210 --> 00:15:55.240 align:middle line:84%
effects of ecological
collapse or devastation.

00:15:55.240 --> 00:15:59.360 align:middle line:84%
But the way this Sage
and Seeker discuss it,

00:15:59.360 --> 00:16:01.560 align:middle line:84%
it comes off
slightly differently.

00:16:01.560 --> 00:16:04.760 align:middle line:84%
Because in a sense,
everything is part of a cycle

00:16:04.760 --> 00:16:06.010 align:middle line:90%
and is perfect.

00:16:06.010 --> 00:16:08.750 align:middle line:84%
And this is an area
people get stuck in.

00:16:08.750 --> 00:16:11.430 align:middle line:84%
If everything is, in
the spiritual sense,

00:16:11.430 --> 00:16:15.380 align:middle line:84%
exactly as it should be
and perfect in this moment,

00:16:15.380 --> 00:16:18.150 align:middle line:84%
then why do I need to
do anything at all?

00:16:18.150 --> 00:16:22.340 align:middle line:84%
So a lot of people
have this feeling

00:16:22.340 --> 00:16:25.690 align:middle line:84%
and believe that this
is-- what can you

00:16:25.690 --> 00:16:27.120 align:middle line:90%
do if it's already destined?

00:16:27.120 --> 00:16:28.980 align:middle line:90%
So answer to that.

00:16:28.980 --> 00:16:31.370 align:middle line:84%
>> CHRISTOPHER: Well
that, in a sense,

00:16:31.370 --> 00:16:32.750 align:middle line:90%
there is some truth to that.

00:16:32.750 --> 00:16:37.820 align:middle line:84%
When you look at this universe's
history of 13.8 billion years,

00:16:37.820 --> 00:16:41.580 align:middle line:84%
and just this flash of
time within Earth's history

00:16:41.580 --> 00:16:45.240 align:middle line:84%
that humanity has
only been alive,

00:16:45.240 --> 00:16:52.340 align:middle line:84%
if you took a 24-hour clock,
and every hour was that the 24

00:16:52.340 --> 00:16:55.640 align:middle line:84%
hours were lined up with a
timeline of the universe,

00:16:55.640 --> 00:16:59.330 align:middle line:84%
humanity appeared in
the last 10 seconds.

00:16:59.330 --> 00:17:02.254 align:middle line:84%
And Earth has gone through
extinctions before.

00:17:02.254 --> 00:17:04.420 align:middle line:84%
We're now going through
what's called the Sixth Mass

00:17:04.420 --> 00:17:05.520 align:middle line:90%
Extinction.

00:17:05.520 --> 00:17:11.190 align:middle line:84%
So the process of dysfunction
is something the universe does.

00:17:11.190 --> 00:17:16.480 align:middle line:84%
So in a way, that it is
doing what it is doing.

00:17:16.480 --> 00:17:19.940 align:middle line:84%
But we are part of
that creative process.

00:17:19.940 --> 00:17:23.849 align:middle line:84%
And so, when I look out
at a landscape that's

00:17:23.849 --> 00:17:26.589 align:middle line:84%
been devastated or I look
at litter on the street,

00:17:26.589 --> 00:17:30.170 align:middle line:84%
or you look at
that ugliness that

00:17:30.170 --> 00:17:36.080 align:middle line:84%
is the indicator that
there's something wrong here,

00:17:36.080 --> 00:17:38.270 align:middle line:84%
there's a dysfunction
going on here,

00:17:38.270 --> 00:17:40.300 align:middle line:90%
I'm listening to my heart.

00:17:40.300 --> 00:17:43.687 align:middle line:84%
And there's part of my heart
that says this isn't right.

00:17:43.687 --> 00:17:45.270 align:middle line:84%
There's something
that feels off here.

00:17:45.270 --> 00:17:48.580 align:middle line:84%
And there's something
that needs to be done.

00:17:48.580 --> 00:17:50.750 align:middle line:90%
So it's almost a paradox.

00:17:50.750 --> 00:17:55.010 align:middle line:84%
In a way, one has to hold
both at the same time,

00:17:55.010 --> 00:17:58.750 align:middle line:84%
that yes, the
infinite has its ways.

00:17:58.750 --> 00:18:00.580 align:middle line:90%
And we're part of its process.

00:18:00.580 --> 00:18:03.200 align:middle line:84%
In a sense, perhaps,
everything is perfect.

00:18:03.200 --> 00:18:05.195 align:middle line:84%
And yet our hearts
call us to-- there

00:18:05.195 --> 00:18:08.770 align:middle line:84%
is something wrong with the
deep injustices in the world.

00:18:08.770 --> 00:18:11.810 align:middle line:84%
There's something want-- wrong
with the ecological devastation

00:18:11.810 --> 00:18:13.590 align:middle line:90%
that we're creating.

00:18:13.590 --> 00:18:16.720 align:middle line:90%
And the two are intertwined.

00:18:16.720 --> 00:18:20.880 align:middle line:84%
One, the world view that
causes our social inequities

00:18:20.880 --> 00:18:24.020 align:middle line:84%
and injustices is
the same worldview

00:18:24.020 --> 00:18:27.150 align:middle line:84%
that would clear-cut
the rainforest

00:18:27.150 --> 00:18:29.610 align:middle line:84%
or dam a river without
paying attention

00:18:29.610 --> 00:18:32.860 align:middle line:84%
to the ecological consequences
or over-fish the oceans.

00:18:32.860 --> 00:18:36.077 align:middle line:84%
It's the same world view that's
causing that destruction.

00:18:36.077 --> 00:18:38.160 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: It's like a
fractured type of thinking.

00:18:38.160 --> 00:18:41.380 align:middle line:84%
It's not holistic in nature,
not considering anything

00:18:41.380 --> 00:18:43.850 align:middle line:84%
beyond its own
instant gratification

00:18:43.850 --> 00:18:46.600 align:middle line:84%
of some agenda in the
moment, whether it's

00:18:46.600 --> 00:18:48.377 align:middle line:84%
personal, corporate,
or political.

00:18:48.377 --> 00:18:49.210 align:middle line:90%
>> CHRISTOPHER: Yes.

00:18:49.210 --> 00:18:52.030 align:middle line:84%
And that's the story of
modern mind that we created.

00:18:52.030 --> 00:18:56.920 align:middle line:84%
And we created it, really,
about 10,000 years ago.

00:18:56.920 --> 00:18:59.560 align:middle line:84%
What the Sage calls
ancient mind--

00:18:59.560 --> 00:19:01.920 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: Yes, go into that,
because that's interesting

00:19:01.920 --> 00:19:03.800 align:middle line:90%
the way it was put together.

00:19:03.800 --> 00:19:06.740 align:middle line:84%
>> CHRISTOPHER: Well, the
ancient mind is what the Sage

00:19:06.740 --> 00:19:11.120 align:middle line:84%
uses for when we became aware
of ourselves as homo sapiens.

00:19:11.120 --> 00:19:15.545 align:middle line:84%
So, depending on which
science you look at,

00:19:15.545 --> 00:19:18.270 align:middle line:84%
it's somewhere between
50,000 to 100,000 years ago

00:19:18.270 --> 00:19:20.415 align:middle line:84%
is when we really started
getting good at language

00:19:20.415 --> 00:19:21.940 align:middle line:90%
as a species.

00:19:21.940 --> 00:19:24.950 align:middle line:84%
And that's when we started
telling ourselves stories.

00:19:24.950 --> 00:19:27.960 align:middle line:84%
So that's the idea
of ancient mind.

00:19:27.960 --> 00:19:31.880 align:middle line:84%
And then we spread across Earth
and created 10,000 cultures

00:19:31.880 --> 00:19:34.150 align:middle line:90%
and 10,000 languages.

00:19:34.150 --> 00:19:38.220 align:middle line:84%
But underneath all
of that experience,

00:19:38.220 --> 00:19:41.430 align:middle line:84%
there was an underlying story,
a fundamental story of we

00:19:41.430 --> 00:19:42.580 align:middle line:90%
are connected.

00:19:42.580 --> 00:19:44.710 align:middle line:90%
We are part of creation.

00:19:44.710 --> 00:19:46.390 align:middle line:90%
We are one species of many.

00:19:46.390 --> 00:19:48.040 align:middle line:84%
We're no better,
but we're no worse.

00:19:48.040 --> 00:19:50.780 align:middle line:90%
We're part of the web of life.

00:19:50.780 --> 00:19:52.280 align:middle line:84%
And in a way, if
you look at it just

00:19:52.280 --> 00:19:55.260 align:middle line:84%
from a strict physical
standpoint, you had to be.

00:19:55.260 --> 00:19:58.030 align:middle line:84%
Because if you didn't know
which plants were OK to eat,

00:19:58.030 --> 00:20:01.544 align:middle line:84%
and which ones were medicine,
and which ones were poisonous,

00:20:01.544 --> 00:20:03.460 align:middle line:84%
you wouldn't, from an
evolutionary standpoint,

00:20:03.460 --> 00:20:04.570 align:middle line:90%
you wouldn't survive.

00:20:04.570 --> 00:20:08.460 align:middle line:84%
And there would
be no procreation

00:20:08.460 --> 00:20:10.910 align:middle line:90%
and your line wouldn't continue.

00:20:10.910 --> 00:20:13.900 align:middle line:84%
So you had to have
that-- which animals were

00:20:13.900 --> 00:20:16.820 align:middle line:84%
safe to eat, how do you find
the ones that you're hunting,

00:20:16.820 --> 00:20:20.560 align:middle line:84%
which ones to avoid because
you may be the prey yourself.

00:20:20.560 --> 00:20:22.830 align:middle line:84%
And then about
10,000 years ago, we

00:20:22.830 --> 00:20:28.690 align:middle line:84%
started getting serious about
agriculture in a systemic way.

00:20:28.690 --> 00:20:31.570 align:middle line:84%
We'd done agriculture
before as a species,

00:20:31.570 --> 00:20:33.980 align:middle line:84%
but it's the
systemic agriculture

00:20:33.980 --> 00:20:37.140 align:middle line:84%
that started telling a
story of separateness,

00:20:37.140 --> 00:20:38.870 align:middle line:84%
that we are separate
from the universe.

00:20:38.870 --> 00:20:40.360 align:middle line:90%
We are separate from each other.

00:20:40.360 --> 00:20:42.930 align:middle line:84%
We're separate from
the web of life.

00:20:42.930 --> 00:20:46.390 align:middle line:84%
And we can do whatever we want
to it without consequence.

00:20:46.390 --> 00:20:50.420 align:middle line:84%
And so the broad sweep
is that ancient mind

00:20:50.420 --> 00:20:54.430 align:middle line:84%
was created somewhere
between 150,000 years ago.

00:20:54.430 --> 00:20:56.340 align:middle line:84%
And about 10,000
years ago, we began

00:20:56.340 --> 00:20:58.910 align:middle line:84%
to step away from that
story into the story

00:20:58.910 --> 00:21:02.740 align:middle line:84%
of modern mind, which
is one of separation.

00:21:02.740 --> 00:21:08.661 align:middle line:84%
And as we got serious about
the Industrial Revolution,

00:21:08.661 --> 00:21:10.660 align:middle line:84%
and the Renaissance, and
European Enlightenment,

00:21:10.660 --> 00:21:13.890 align:middle line:84%
we became very deep into
that story of separation--

00:21:13.890 --> 00:21:17.790 align:middle line:84%
that, not only are we separate,
the universe isn't even alive.

00:21:17.790 --> 00:21:20.560 align:middle line:84%
It's a dead universe
with no meaning.

00:21:20.560 --> 00:21:22.130 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: So that
is, in essence,

00:21:22.130 --> 00:21:25.720 align:middle line:84%
moving from the instinctive or
animal mind to the intellectual

00:21:25.720 --> 00:21:28.104 align:middle line:84%
mind, shift away
from the instinctive.

00:21:28.104 --> 00:21:29.520 align:middle line:84%
>> CHRISTOPHER:
Yes, very much so.

00:21:29.520 --> 00:21:32.600 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: But
one thing is that,

00:21:32.600 --> 00:21:36.730 align:middle line:84%
if you're looking at the
instinctive aspect of self,

00:21:36.730 --> 00:21:41.400 align:middle line:84%
then that would certainly
penetrate into much other finer

00:21:41.400 --> 00:21:43.610 align:middle line:84%
dimensional fields
of consciousness.

00:21:43.610 --> 00:21:47.510 align:middle line:84%
Is there an area in which
the levels of consciousness

00:21:47.510 --> 00:21:51.190 align:middle line:84%
and creative forces is explained
within the realm of string

00:21:51.190 --> 00:21:54.122 align:middle line:84%
theory, quantum
sciences, and so forth?

00:21:54.122 --> 00:21:55.820 align:middle line:84%
And I'm setting this
up for a reason.

00:21:55.820 --> 00:21:57.160 align:middle line:90%
I'm asking for a reason.

00:21:57.160 --> 00:21:59.060 align:middle line:84%
>> CHRISTOPHER: I go
to a place-- well,

00:21:59.060 --> 00:22:01.350 align:middle line:84%
there's the third mind
that's now emerging,

00:22:01.350 --> 00:22:03.450 align:middle line:90%
which is called planetary mind.

00:22:03.450 --> 00:22:07.660 align:middle line:84%
And that's a term that Pierre
Teilhard de Chardin used,

00:22:07.660 --> 00:22:10.140 align:middle line:84%
and other people have
used, to describe

00:22:10.140 --> 00:22:12.750 align:middle line:84%
the world view that
is now emerging.

00:22:12.750 --> 00:22:19.660 align:middle line:84%
And I don't precisely talk about
string theory or that quantum

00:22:19.660 --> 00:22:21.440 align:middle line:90%
mechanics, but that is...

00:22:21.440 --> 00:22:24.910 align:middle line:84%
informs the story of
planetary mind, which

00:22:24.910 --> 00:22:29.240 align:middle line:84%
is the story of the creative
force of the infinite

00:22:29.240 --> 00:22:33.290 align:middle line:84%
flows throughout the universe
and through each one of us,

00:22:33.290 --> 00:22:36.120 align:middle line:84%
ever creative,
seizing catastrophe

00:22:36.120 --> 00:22:38.970 align:middle line:84%
to create anew, as
it drives itself

00:22:38.970 --> 00:22:42.210 align:middle line:84%
towards ever greater complexity,
ever greater order, and ever

00:22:42.210 --> 00:22:46.820 align:middle line:84%
greater beauty, as it
drives itself toward life.

00:22:46.820 --> 00:22:48.450 align:middle line:90%
It's always been thus.

00:22:48.450 --> 00:22:50.670 align:middle line:90%
We never were separate.

00:22:50.670 --> 00:22:53.070 align:middle line:84%
And so there's a
part of the book that

00:22:53.070 --> 00:22:54.910 align:middle line:84%
talks about the story
of planetary mind--

00:22:54.910 --> 00:22:57.020 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: Yes, in a more
poetic and abstract way.

00:22:57.020 --> 00:23:00.480 align:middle line:84%
>> CHRISTOPHER: Yes, that,
in a sense-- and in fact,

00:23:00.480 --> 00:23:03.305 align:middle line:84%
there's a piece that I
wrote right after that.

00:23:03.305 --> 00:23:05.820 align:middle line:84%
It talks about
planetary mind knows

00:23:05.820 --> 00:23:09.220 align:middle line:84%
that there is no creator
separate from the created.

00:23:09.220 --> 00:23:13.080 align:middle line:84%
There is only creation that
flows throughout each one of us

00:23:13.080 --> 00:23:17.070 align:middle line:84%
and flows throughout
the web of life.

00:23:17.070 --> 00:23:20.080 align:middle line:84%
And it's interesting because, in
a way, it's something you feel.

00:23:20.080 --> 00:23:22.080 align:middle line:84%
You really can't
describe so much.

00:23:22.080 --> 00:23:24.500 align:middle line:84%
And I haven't really gotten
my logical head around it.

00:23:24.500 --> 00:23:26.470 align:middle line:84%
But it's not like
there is a separate god

00:23:26.470 --> 00:23:27.850 align:middle line:90%
or a separate creator.

00:23:27.850 --> 00:23:31.520 align:middle line:84%
We are the spirit in
the form of Regina.

00:23:31.520 --> 00:23:33.750 align:middle line:84%
We are the spear in
the form of David,

00:23:33.750 --> 00:23:36.230 align:middle line:90%
or the form of human beings.

00:23:36.230 --> 00:23:38.920 align:middle line:84%
We are the universe in
the form of a human being.

00:23:38.920 --> 00:23:41.850 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: And, albeit, an
individuated aspect of it.

00:23:41.850 --> 00:23:46.820 align:middle line:84%
>> CHRISTOPHER: Yes, and we have
this evolutionary heritage that

00:23:46.820 --> 00:23:49.400 align:middle line:90%
we carry in our bodies.

00:23:49.400 --> 00:23:53.490 align:middle line:84%
We have not four separate
brains, but four aspects

00:23:53.490 --> 00:23:55.930 align:middle line:84%
of our brains-- the
old lizard brain,

00:23:55.930 --> 00:23:59.060 align:middle line:84%
and then the mammalian
brain, and what's

00:23:59.060 --> 00:24:02.370 align:middle line:84%
called the "monkey mind"
brain, and then the neocortex.

00:24:02.370 --> 00:24:07.420 align:middle line:84%
And they're all very much tied
into a physical evolution.

00:24:07.420 --> 00:24:10.970 align:middle line:84%
But my feeling is
that somehow it's

00:24:10.970 --> 00:24:14.770 align:middle line:84%
using that to engage
into the universe

00:24:14.770 --> 00:24:18.680 align:middle line:84%
into its creative process, that
it's the physical manifestation

00:24:18.680 --> 00:24:21.410 align:middle line:84%
of perhaps a consciousness
that was there

00:24:21.410 --> 00:24:23.440 align:middle line:90%
at the unfathomable mystery.

00:24:23.440 --> 00:24:26.940 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: And in a sense,
even as the animal portion

00:24:26.940 --> 00:24:27.680 align:middle line:90%
of ourselves.

00:24:27.680 --> 00:24:32.490 align:middle line:84%
I view it as kind of a two-for
species imbued with something

00:24:32.490 --> 00:24:34.900 align:middle line:84%
beyond that also of a
multi-dimensional nature.

00:24:34.900 --> 00:24:35.900 align:middle line:90%
>> CHRISTOPHER: Oh, yes.

00:24:35.900 --> 00:24:38.990 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: But nonetheless, the
portion that was acting more

00:24:38.990 --> 00:24:42.920 align:middle line:84%
instinctively, as
far as I view it,

00:24:42.920 --> 00:24:45.680 align:middle line:84%
was really much more in touch
with the multi-dimensional

00:24:45.680 --> 00:24:47.060 align:middle line:90%
aspect of life.

00:24:47.060 --> 00:24:49.820 align:middle line:84%
Because it was receiving
these unconscious inputs

00:24:49.820 --> 00:24:51.880 align:middle line:84%
all the time, which
helped with survival.

00:24:51.880 --> 00:24:54.380 align:middle line:84%
But it also helped with
other higher understandings,

00:24:54.380 --> 00:24:57.760 align:middle line:84%
as we know from even
40,000-year-old cave art.

00:24:57.760 --> 00:25:03.400 align:middle line:84%
There's some very sophisticated
and conceptually sublime

00:25:03.400 --> 00:25:06.837 align:middle line:84%
cave art from 40,000
years ago, and plus.

00:25:06.837 --> 00:25:07.670 align:middle line:90%
>> CHRISTOPHER: Yes.

00:25:07.670 --> 00:25:13.230 align:middle line:84%
And there's a thought
that, as you were talking,

00:25:13.230 --> 00:25:18.080 align:middle line:84%
there is that intuition
is denigrated,

00:25:18.080 --> 00:25:23.200 align:middle line:84%
and if you take a strictly
evidentiary-based scientific

00:25:23.200 --> 00:25:28.640 align:middle line:84%
view of looking at reality
as the only way of getting

00:25:28.640 --> 00:25:33.220 align:middle line:84%
to truth, then that
non-rational reality

00:25:33.220 --> 00:25:36.640 align:middle line:84%
is denigrated to the point
where we become strangers

00:25:36.640 --> 00:25:38.000 align:middle line:90%
to ourselves.

00:25:38.000 --> 00:25:41.080 align:middle line:84%
We become strangers to that
older animal part of ourselves,

00:25:41.080 --> 00:25:43.620 align:middle line:90%
which hasn't gone away.

00:25:43.620 --> 00:25:46.140 align:middle line:84%
And it knows that
something is wrong.

00:25:46.140 --> 00:25:50.570 align:middle line:84%
But this part of the brain
and this part of our psyche

00:25:50.570 --> 00:25:52.020 align:middle line:84%
has been told the
story-- and has

00:25:52.020 --> 00:25:54.490 align:middle line:84%
bought a story--
that's at odds with it.

00:25:54.490 --> 00:25:57.290 align:middle line:84%
So no wonder we have
this dysfunction

00:25:57.290 --> 00:26:01.362 align:middle line:84%
that happens within us and
the stress that we feel.

00:26:01.362 --> 00:26:03.320 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: And the thing
is it's the feelings--

00:26:03.320 --> 00:26:05.470 align:middle line:84%
and I separate that from
the word "emotions."

00:26:05.470 --> 00:26:09.450 align:middle line:84%
It's the feelings that will
guide us back to the truth,

00:26:09.450 --> 00:26:11.000 align:middle line:90%
because that permeates all.

00:26:11.000 --> 00:26:13.500 align:middle line:84%
That's the finer aspect
that's called, also,

00:26:13.500 --> 00:26:15.150 align:middle line:90%
the intuitive part, right.

00:26:15.150 --> 00:26:18.900 align:middle line:84%
And that part, as several
thousand years ago,

00:26:18.900 --> 00:26:22.140 align:middle line:84%
once we entered into a
dominantly patriarchal world

00:26:22.140 --> 00:26:26.070 align:middle line:84%
planetary structure, that
had to be given way to.

00:26:26.070 --> 00:26:29.580 align:middle line:84%
And by then, it
was even considered

00:26:29.580 --> 00:26:34.630 align:middle line:84%
unholy or evil to use
one's intuition, which

00:26:34.630 --> 00:26:38.060 align:middle line:84%
is a feminine aspect
of all of our beings.

00:26:38.060 --> 00:26:42.210 align:middle line:84%
So you chose to have
the Sage as a female,

00:26:42.210 --> 00:26:46.790 align:middle line:84%
and as a female of indistinct
ethnicity, as a matter of fact.

00:26:46.790 --> 00:26:51.510 align:middle line:84%
And so tell us, bringing that
up, why did you choose that?

00:26:51.510 --> 00:26:55.630 align:middle line:84%
>> CHRISTOPHER: Well, the Sage
actually started out as a man,

00:26:55.630 --> 00:27:00.770 align:middle line:84%
and in fact, in my mind,
I saw two white men.

00:27:00.770 --> 00:27:02.700 align:middle line:84%
And I can't remember
exactly when,

00:27:02.700 --> 00:27:08.540 align:middle line:84%
but it became very clear that
this is just not going to fly.

00:27:08.540 --> 00:27:11.620 align:middle line:84%
This is what caused the
problem in the first place--

00:27:11.620 --> 00:27:13.780 align:middle line:84%
is a very narrow
view of reality,

00:27:13.780 --> 00:27:17.930 align:middle line:84%
the male and Eurocentric
view of reality.

00:27:17.930 --> 00:27:22.510 align:middle line:84%
And it became clear that,
no, you can't do that.

00:27:22.510 --> 00:27:25.240 align:middle line:84%
And I started
realizing that you're

00:27:25.240 --> 00:27:28.656 align:middle line:84%
going to have to make
the Sage a woman.

00:27:28.656 --> 00:27:30.030 align:middle line:84%
And I was very
nervous about that

00:27:30.030 --> 00:27:32.050 align:middle line:84%
because, at least
in this incarnation,

00:27:32.050 --> 00:27:34.210 align:middle line:84%
I have no idea what
it's like to be a woman.

00:27:34.210 --> 00:27:37.560 align:middle line:84%
So I was very hesitant
to put the words

00:27:37.560 --> 00:27:42.980 align:middle line:84%
in the mouth of a woman,
especially a woman of color.

00:27:42.980 --> 00:27:44.700 align:middle line:90%
But I knew I had to try.

00:27:44.700 --> 00:27:47.320 align:middle line:84%
I would rather fail
spectacularly than

00:27:47.320 --> 00:27:49.690 align:middle line:84%
to take the safe route,
which would have certainly

00:27:49.690 --> 00:27:50.430 align:middle line:90%
been a failure.

00:27:50.430 --> 00:27:51.500 align:middle line:90%
It wouldn't have worked.

00:27:51.500 --> 00:27:52.370 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: It wouldn't
have worked the same.

00:27:52.370 --> 00:27:54.180 align:middle line:84%
>> CHRISTOPHER: It
wouldn't have flown.

00:27:54.180 --> 00:27:58.080 align:middle line:84%
And so at a certain point,
I was being asked well,

00:27:58.080 --> 00:27:59.610 align:middle line:90%
who is the Sage?

00:27:59.610 --> 00:28:01.860 align:middle line:90%
Tell us more about her.

00:28:01.860 --> 00:28:05.710 align:middle line:84%
And there was a
young woman who was--

00:28:05.710 --> 00:28:08.080 align:middle line:84%
her name is Amber
Espinoza-Jones.

00:28:08.080 --> 00:28:09.730 align:middle line:84%
And she wrote this
wonderful piece

00:28:09.730 --> 00:28:13.100 align:middle line:84%
for Destiny Arts, which
is out of Oakland.

00:28:13.100 --> 00:28:16.630 align:middle line:84%
They work with at-risk youth and
teach them theater and martial

00:28:16.630 --> 00:28:17.720 align:middle line:90%
arts.

00:28:17.720 --> 00:28:20.270 align:middle line:84%
And she wrote this
one wonderful piece,

00:28:20.270 --> 00:28:23.440 align:middle line:84%
talking about what it
was like to have heritage

00:28:23.440 --> 00:28:27.670 align:middle line:84%
from all continents, that
people ask her, well,

00:28:27.670 --> 00:28:29.019 align:middle line:90%
what are you are you?

00:28:29.019 --> 00:28:29.560 align:middle line:90%
Are you Arab?

00:28:29.560 --> 00:28:30.790 align:middle line:90%
Are you Mexican?

00:28:30.790 --> 00:28:32.330 align:middle line:90%
Are you Black?

00:28:32.330 --> 00:28:34.070 align:middle line:90%
And actually, no, he says.

00:28:34.070 --> 00:28:37.780 align:middle line:84%
You can't be black
with that hair.

00:28:37.780 --> 00:28:40.172 align:middle line:84%
And she says, I
want to tell them--

00:28:40.172 --> 00:28:41.630 align:middle line:84%
I may be able to
recite some of it.

00:28:41.630 --> 00:28:47.160 align:middle line:84%
I like to tell people that
I'm a daughter of Oakland.

00:28:47.160 --> 00:28:51.020 align:middle line:84%
I find homage in the slave and
the slave master-- Grandfather,

00:28:51.020 --> 00:28:54.240 align:middle line:84%
the conquered,
Grandfather, the conqueror.

00:28:54.240 --> 00:28:59.120 align:middle line:84%
My table is set with creme
brulee, homemade tortillas,

00:28:59.120 --> 00:29:03.150 align:middle line:84%
things that should not belong
together on a kitchen table.

00:29:03.150 --> 00:29:10.210 align:middle line:84%
And she says she's some part
African, European, Australian,

00:29:10.210 --> 00:29:13.680 align:middle line:84%
Jamaican, and just has this
heritage that she brings

00:29:13.680 --> 00:29:16.540 align:middle line:84%
into the piece, "Gumbo
Pot for the Soul."

00:29:16.540 --> 00:29:18.800 align:middle line:84%
And when I heard her perform
that, I said, my God.

00:29:18.800 --> 00:29:21.710 align:middle line:90%
There's the Sage.

00:29:21.710 --> 00:29:25.430 align:middle line:84%
And this was something that
was so amazing to have emerge.

00:29:25.430 --> 00:29:26.680 align:middle line:90%
Because it wasn't intentional.

00:29:26.680 --> 00:29:28.570 align:middle line:90%
It wasn't planned.

00:29:28.570 --> 00:29:30.520 align:middle line:84%
It just emerged
that this character

00:29:30.520 --> 00:29:34.790 align:middle line:84%
became the metaphor for
that part of humanity

00:29:34.790 --> 00:29:37.350 align:middle line:84%
which our modern mind
has denigrated and put

00:29:37.350 --> 00:29:40.190 align:middle line:90%
down for so long.

00:29:40.190 --> 00:29:45.170 align:middle line:84%
And that conversation
of privilege

00:29:45.170 --> 00:29:49.660 align:middle line:84%
that I get to enjoy-- as
white, male, and heterosexual,

00:29:49.660 --> 00:29:56.180 align:middle line:84%
I enjoy certain privileges
that are unconscious, largely.

00:29:56.180 --> 00:30:00.820 align:middle line:84%
And the reason why I bring
this up and talk about it,

00:30:00.820 --> 00:30:02.890 align:middle line:84%
is that it's part
of the work that I

00:30:02.890 --> 00:30:05.340 align:middle line:84%
think needs to be
done during our time.

00:30:05.340 --> 00:30:07.990 align:middle line:84%
It's part of the
conversation we need

00:30:07.990 --> 00:30:11.340 align:middle line:84%
to have as we bring
planetary mind forth.

00:30:11.340 --> 00:30:17.050 align:middle line:84%
Because as I said, that
worldview of privilege

00:30:17.050 --> 00:30:21.610 align:middle line:84%
is part of the problem, when we
deal with the ecological crises

00:30:21.610 --> 00:30:24.080 align:middle line:84%
that we're facing, and even
the spiritual crises that we're

00:30:24.080 --> 00:30:28.370 align:middle line:84%
facing, too-- that women are
supposed to look a certain way.

00:30:28.370 --> 00:30:31.150 align:middle line:84%
Men are supposed to
be a certain way.

00:30:31.150 --> 00:30:34.270 align:middle line:84%
There was a couple who asked
a question of an audience

00:30:34.270 --> 00:30:37.170 align:middle line:90%
at the Bioneers conference.

00:30:37.170 --> 00:30:38.740 align:middle line:90%
And they asked two questions.

00:30:38.740 --> 00:30:41.810 align:middle line:84%
And they asked of the men--
it was something like,

00:30:41.810 --> 00:30:46.760 align:middle line:84%
how many people in
the audience grew up

00:30:46.760 --> 00:30:49.660 align:middle line:84%
with a feeling that you have
to serve in the military,

00:30:49.660 --> 00:30:52.960 align:middle line:90%
and it is your duty to do so?

00:30:52.960 --> 00:30:54.640 align:middle line:84%
And the people who
raised their hand

00:30:54.640 --> 00:30:58.530 align:middle line:84%
tended to be
overwhelmingly male.

00:30:58.530 --> 00:31:01.150 align:middle line:84%
And then they asked the
question, when you walk down

00:31:01.150 --> 00:31:03.670 align:middle line:84%
a dark street at
night, how many of you

00:31:03.670 --> 00:31:07.550 align:middle line:84%
had the experience of
being afraid and unwilling

00:31:07.550 --> 00:31:11.160 align:middle line:84%
and wanting to turn away because
of the fear, of because of who

00:31:11.160 --> 00:31:13.480 align:middle line:90%
you were as a gender?

00:31:13.480 --> 00:31:15.560 align:middle line:84%
And all the women
raise their hands.

00:31:15.560 --> 00:31:16.560 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: This is true.

00:31:16.560 --> 00:31:19.110 align:middle line:84%
>> CHRISTOPHER: And that's
part of that conversation.

00:31:19.110 --> 00:31:21.890 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: Yes, and there has
been research done on this,

00:31:21.890 --> 00:31:26.152 align:middle line:84%
just in terms of brain chemistry
alone that's important to note.

00:31:26.152 --> 00:31:27.610 align:middle line:84%
>> CHRISTOPHER:
And it's automatic.

00:31:27.610 --> 00:31:28.235 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Yes.

00:31:28.235 --> 00:31:31.850 align:middle line:84%
It's deeply embedded within our
subconscious, this very aspect

00:31:31.850 --> 00:31:33.630 align:middle line:84%
you talked about--
about privilege.

00:31:33.630 --> 00:31:36.910 align:middle line:84%
And that is the levels
of dopamine and serotonin

00:31:36.910 --> 00:31:39.940 align:middle line:84%
production, particularly
serotonin production in women,

00:31:39.940 --> 00:31:42.530 align:middle line:84%
is quite a bit lower
than that in men,

00:31:42.530 --> 00:31:46.110 align:middle line:84%
which is also reflected
in eating habits.

00:31:46.110 --> 00:31:48.930 align:middle line:84%
It's reflected in the
way women socialize.

00:31:48.930 --> 00:31:52.360 align:middle line:84%
Women will go more for
carbohydrates and sweet things,

00:31:52.360 --> 00:31:57.130 align:middle line:84%
which boosts, temporarily,
serotonin levels, for example.

00:31:57.130 --> 00:32:01.730 align:middle line:84%
And that's just an effect
of almost genetically--

00:32:01.730 --> 00:32:04.460 align:middle line:84%
well, beyond genetically--
in the field,

00:32:04.460 --> 00:32:09.550 align:middle line:84%
passed on relationship to
self and self-identity.

00:32:09.550 --> 00:32:12.370 align:middle line:84%
And the same thing with
different minority groups

00:32:12.370 --> 00:32:13.660 align:middle line:90%
responded differently.

00:32:13.660 --> 00:32:17.230 align:middle line:84%
But again, compared to the white
male-- the white, as you say,

00:32:17.230 --> 00:32:20.780 align:middle line:84%
Eurocentro male-- everyone
else on this planet

00:32:20.780 --> 00:32:23.560 align:middle line:84%
produces a lower
level, generally--

00:32:23.560 --> 00:32:25.990 align:middle line:84%
these are generalizations--
a lower level

00:32:25.990 --> 00:32:28.510 align:middle line:84%
of serotonin and dopamine,
which are those "let's

00:32:28.510 --> 00:32:31.010 align:middle line:84%
get her done"
feel-good chemicals.

00:32:31.010 --> 00:32:33.820 align:middle line:84%
Now, I know that has to
be shifting, as well.

00:32:33.820 --> 00:32:34.750 align:middle line:90%
>> CHRISTOPHER: Yes.

00:32:34.750 --> 00:32:37.830 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: As there becomes more
confusion and clouding around

00:32:37.830 --> 00:32:39.675 align:middle line:84%
roles and our
place in the world.

00:32:39.675 --> 00:32:42.050 align:middle line:84%
>> CHRISTOPHER: Yes, well the
old structures need to come

00:32:42.050 --> 00:32:44.850 align:middle line:84%
down, as we're building
the new structures.

00:32:44.850 --> 00:32:46.650 align:middle line:84%
I mean, you don't
know if they have

00:32:46.650 --> 00:32:48.635 align:middle line:84%
to be razed entirely
before you create them.

00:32:48.635 --> 00:32:50.510 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: Exactly, you
can create it anyway.

00:32:50.510 --> 00:32:53.260 align:middle line:84%
>> CHRISTOPHER: I have
a feeling they're both--

00:32:53.260 --> 00:32:55.020 align:middle line:84%
as the one structures
are coming down,

00:32:55.020 --> 00:32:56.660 align:middle line:84%
the other structures
are coming up--

00:32:56.660 --> 00:32:56.900 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Absolutley.

00:32:56.900 --> 00:32:58.040 align:middle line:84%
>> CHRISTOPHER:
--at the same time.

00:32:58.040 --> 00:32:59.706 align:middle line:84%
And there's actually
a point there, too,

00:32:59.706 --> 00:33:02.820 align:middle line:84%
is that it not only is
a cultural thing that

00:33:02.820 --> 00:33:04.230 align:middle line:90%
is created that is passed down.

00:33:04.230 --> 00:33:06.300 align:middle line:90%
It also is genetic.

00:33:06.300 --> 00:33:10.580 align:middle line:84%
We have this desire to go after
the sugar, fat, and sweets,

00:33:10.580 --> 00:33:13.500 align:middle line:84%
because that's what
caused us to survive.

00:33:13.500 --> 00:33:14.420 align:middle line:90%
It was rare.

00:33:14.420 --> 00:33:16.172 align:middle line:84%
It's hard to make
that stuff in nature.

00:33:16.172 --> 00:33:17.130 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: That's true.

00:33:17.130 --> 00:33:19.296 align:middle line:84%
>> CHRISTOPHER: The web of
life takes a lot of time.

00:33:19.296 --> 00:33:20.300 align:middle line:90%
It's a lot of energy.

00:33:20.300 --> 00:33:23.590 align:middle line:84%
So it doesn't throw out fat,
sugar, and salt out there

00:33:23.590 --> 00:33:24.750 align:middle line:90%
just everywhere.

00:33:24.750 --> 00:33:28.420 align:middle line:84%
So when it was rare, it was
the most important thing

00:33:28.420 --> 00:33:30.760 align:middle line:84%
for men and women
to do, was to find

00:33:30.760 --> 00:33:33.570 align:middle line:90%
that salt, that sugar, and fat.

00:33:33.570 --> 00:33:37.860 align:middle line:84%
And now, we go to the grocery
store, and there it is.

00:33:37.860 --> 00:33:42.400 align:middle line:84%
And I had this wonderful-- this
actual particular piece came

00:33:42.400 --> 00:33:46.070 align:middle line:84%
out of Michael Dowd's
work, a man who

00:33:46.070 --> 00:33:50.330 align:middle line:84%
wrote with Connie
Barlow, a book called

00:33:50.330 --> 00:33:54.480 align:middle line:84%
"Thank God for Evolution,"
where he talks about how there's

00:33:54.480 --> 00:33:58.440 align:middle line:84%
nothing morally wrong with you
that you can't resist sweets.

00:33:58.440 --> 00:34:03.424 align:middle line:84%
There is this burning desire for
life that says eat the sweets.

00:34:03.424 --> 00:34:05.174 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: That's true,
because we think--

00:34:05.174 --> 00:34:05.292 align:middle line:84%
>> CHRISTOPHER:
Because we need to

00:34:05.292 --> 00:34:06.750 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: --they're
normally safe.

00:34:06.750 --> 00:34:07.270 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

00:34:07.270 --> 00:34:09.290 align:middle line:84%
They are normally safe
as well, historically,

00:34:09.290 --> 00:34:10.290 align:middle line:90%
when we were in a more--

00:34:10.290 --> 00:34:14.610 align:middle line:84%
>> CHRISTOPHER: So we have this
amazing complexity of genetics,

00:34:14.610 --> 00:34:18.370 align:middle line:84%
as well as cultural stories,
that say, behave this way.

00:34:18.370 --> 00:34:20.827 align:middle line:84%
And we get into really
amazing craziness sometimes.

00:34:20.827 --> 00:34:21.785 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Yeah, we do.

00:34:21.785 --> 00:34:24.370 align:middle line:84%
I remember what I was
going to ask you about.

00:34:24.370 --> 00:34:28.400 align:middle line:84%
And it had to do with the way
the species was assembling

00:34:28.400 --> 00:34:31.040 align:middle line:84%
itself in the
earlier life forms.

00:34:31.040 --> 00:34:33.540 align:middle line:84%
And this is a really
important one right now.

00:34:33.540 --> 00:34:36.719 align:middle line:84%
And the Sage was mentioning
that, remember, once

00:34:36.719 --> 00:34:39.739 align:middle line:84%
upon a time, the
oxygen on your planet

00:34:39.739 --> 00:34:42.860 align:middle line:84%
was even devastating
to the life forms.

00:34:42.860 --> 00:34:46.110 align:middle line:84%
And now, then we
came to continue

00:34:46.110 --> 00:34:48.960 align:middle line:84%
maturing, becoming more
complex, as species go,

00:34:48.960 --> 00:34:52.340 align:middle line:84%
to where we needed-- the
one thing we need is oxygen,

00:34:52.340 --> 00:34:53.900 align:middle line:90%
above and beyond anything else.

00:34:53.900 --> 00:34:57.090 align:middle line:84%
And now we're in a state
of oxygen decline again.

00:34:57.090 --> 00:35:00.210 align:middle line:84%
And yet we have an influx
of increased radiation,

00:35:00.210 --> 00:35:03.690 align:middle line:84%
for example-- lots of
radiation, not necessarily

00:35:03.690 --> 00:35:04.700 align:middle line:90%
all from the sun.

00:35:04.700 --> 00:35:07.090 align:middle line:84%
We know some of what's
going on around the planet.

00:35:07.090 --> 00:35:09.860 align:middle line:84%
And so, when I looked at
that part of the book,

00:35:09.860 --> 00:35:15.470 align:middle line:84%
where the Sage was talking
about everything is in a cycle.

00:35:15.470 --> 00:35:17.600 align:middle line:84%
Everything creates
and destroys--

00:35:17.600 --> 00:35:21.600 align:middle line:84%
>> CHRISTOPHER: Yes,
the infinite destroys,

00:35:21.600 --> 00:35:23.320 align:middle line:90%
therefore it must create.

00:35:23.320 --> 00:35:25.940 align:middle line:84%
The infinite creates,
therefore it must destroy.

00:35:25.940 --> 00:35:28.150 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: So how--
because you wrote it.

00:35:28.150 --> 00:35:29.220 align:middle line:90%
You wrote her.

00:35:29.220 --> 00:35:31.350 align:middle line:84%
Let's talk about what you
were trying to say there.

00:35:31.350 --> 00:35:33.450 align:middle line:84%
Because you are
trying not to put

00:35:33.450 --> 00:35:34.950 align:middle line:84%
too much judgment
on the fact that,

00:35:34.950 --> 00:35:36.240 align:middle line:90%
yes, things are falling away.

00:35:36.240 --> 00:35:38.530 align:middle line:84%
Yes, it was devastating
to you as a child.

00:35:38.530 --> 00:35:41.720 align:middle line:84%
But at the same time, that
allows space for new creation,

00:35:41.720 --> 00:35:42.630 align:middle line:90%
as well.

00:35:42.630 --> 00:35:44.740 align:middle line:84%
Are we going to be creating
on a different level,

00:35:44.740 --> 00:35:46.320 align:middle line:90%
from your mind's eye?

00:35:46.320 --> 00:35:48.770 align:middle line:84%
>> CHRISTOPHER: Well, and
that's-- as you were talking,

00:35:48.770 --> 00:35:57.050 align:middle line:84%
this one thought sprang to me
of serendipity is what emerges

00:35:57.050 --> 00:36:01.350 align:middle line:84%
at the confluence of
chance and creativity.

00:36:01.350 --> 00:36:04.505 align:middle line:90%
And so that--

00:36:04.505 --> 00:36:06.907 align:middle line:90%


00:36:06.907 --> 00:36:09.240 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: It's like another
saying is no problem arises

00:36:09.240 --> 00:36:11.450 align:middle line:84%
without a simultaneous
solution being there.

00:36:11.450 --> 00:36:12.340 align:middle line:90%
>> CHRISTOPHER: Yes.

00:36:12.340 --> 00:36:14.994 align:middle line:84%
And the idea that-- I
mean, we can certainly

00:36:14.994 --> 00:36:16.410 align:middle line:84%
get into our old
stories of how we

00:36:16.410 --> 00:36:17.743 align:middle line:90%
were wounded when we were young.

00:36:17.743 --> 00:36:18.850 align:middle line:90%
And that's very true.

00:36:18.850 --> 00:36:22.280 align:middle line:84%
There was realities
that we all had.

00:36:22.280 --> 00:36:26.430 align:middle line:84%
But to stay in that
story doesn't serve.

00:36:26.430 --> 00:36:32.084 align:middle line:84%
And then-- I love that
particular part of the Oxygen

00:36:32.084 --> 00:36:32.625 align:middle line:90%
Catastrophe--

00:36:32.625 --> 00:36:32.990 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: I do, too.

00:36:32.990 --> 00:36:34.880 align:middle line:84%
>> CHRISTOPHER: --too,
where, especially--

00:36:34.880 --> 00:36:36.866 align:middle line:84%
and sometimes I
would be writing,

00:36:36.866 --> 00:36:38.490 align:middle line:84%
and I would set my
pencil down and say,

00:36:38.490 --> 00:36:40.770 align:middle line:84%
where in the world
did this come from?

00:36:40.770 --> 00:36:47.220 align:middle line:84%
Where the beings who
invented photosynthesis--

00:36:47.220 --> 00:36:52.440 align:middle line:84%
they gave off oxygen, a
vile and poisonous fire that

00:36:52.440 --> 00:36:57.480 align:middle line:84%
turned the color-- the color of
the sky an ominous deadly blue.

00:36:57.480 --> 00:37:00.540 align:middle line:84%
And when I tell that
story sometimes,

00:37:00.540 --> 00:37:03.670 align:middle line:84%
I'm next to a window, and
I'll look at the blue sky.

00:37:03.670 --> 00:37:06.370 align:middle line:84%
And people will look at
me and say, wait a minute.

00:37:06.370 --> 00:37:08.770 align:middle line:90%
Blue is a good color.

00:37:08.770 --> 00:37:10.200 align:middle line:90%
But no, it wasn't.

00:37:10.200 --> 00:37:11.810 align:middle line:90%
It was devastating.

00:37:11.810 --> 00:37:14.880 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: Yes, and even
if you look into the notion

00:37:14.880 --> 00:37:18.580 align:middle line:84%
of extraterrestrial visitors,
it's often said that our oxygen

00:37:18.580 --> 00:37:22.010 align:middle line:84%
is very harsh and damaging
to them on a physical level.

00:37:22.010 --> 00:37:24.940 align:middle line:84%
They can't handle that oxygen
that we thrive on, but are

00:37:24.940 --> 00:37:27.290 align:middle line:84%
going to have to become
less dependent on.

00:37:27.290 --> 00:37:28.440 align:middle line:90%
>> CHRISTOPHER: Well, yeah.

00:37:28.440 --> 00:37:32.810 align:middle line:84%
And the metaphor there,
and actually the reality,

00:37:32.810 --> 00:37:37.910 align:middle line:84%
is that the oxygen crisis--
James Lovelock wrote about this

00:37:37.910 --> 00:37:42.110 align:middle line:84%
in-- I forget which exact book,
either "Gaia" or "The Ages

00:37:42.110 --> 00:37:45.300 align:middle line:84%
of Gaia," where he talks
about how life became

00:37:45.300 --> 00:37:49.080 align:middle line:84%
that close to being snuffed out
because of this catastrophe.

00:37:49.080 --> 00:37:51.370 align:middle line:84%
Similar to what
we're facing now,

00:37:51.370 --> 00:37:56.140 align:middle line:84%
is that we-- I don't think we
would wipe out all of life,

00:37:56.140 --> 00:37:59.480 align:middle line:84%
but we certainly are doing
an enormous amount of damage.

00:37:59.480 --> 00:38:02.550 align:middle line:84%
And we're certainly
at risk for losing

00:38:02.550 --> 00:38:05.580 align:middle line:84%
all the creatures
of the higher order.

00:38:05.580 --> 00:38:07.819 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: Of the current
matrix of the web of life,

00:38:07.819 --> 00:38:08.360 align:middle line:90%
it is being--

00:38:08.360 --> 00:38:10.193 align:middle line:84%
>> CHRISTOPHER: It's
going to be devastated.

00:38:10.193 --> 00:38:11.890 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: And
perhaps irrevocably--

00:38:11.890 --> 00:38:12.390 align:middle line:90%
>> CHRISTOPHER: Perhaps.

00:38:12.390 --> 00:38:12.740 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: --altered.

00:38:12.740 --> 00:38:14.110 align:middle line:90%
>> CHRISTOPHER: We don't know.

00:38:14.110 --> 00:38:14.280 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: We don't know.

00:38:14.280 --> 00:38:16.560 align:middle line:84%
>> CHRISTOPHER: Why take
that chance, really.

00:38:16.560 --> 00:38:18.420 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: Well,
and again, I mean,

00:38:18.420 --> 00:38:21.270 align:middle line:84%
we're at a point now where
we are officially an oxygen

00:38:21.270 --> 00:38:24.730 align:middle line:84%
deprived planet, for
what our life form--

00:38:24.730 --> 00:38:26.970 align:middle line:84%
Our immune system is
dependent on oxygen.

00:38:26.970 --> 00:38:29.730 align:middle line:84%
We're not getting enough
oxygen around this planet,

00:38:29.730 --> 00:38:34.450 align:middle line:84%
save for maybe if you still
live in a nicely hydrated area

00:38:34.450 --> 00:38:35.230 align:middle line:90%
in the Amazon.

00:38:35.230 --> 00:38:37.290 align:middle line:84%
But so much of it's
been-- the lungs

00:38:37.290 --> 00:38:40.570 align:middle line:84%
of the planet have been
cleared, to a large extent.

00:38:40.570 --> 00:38:44.980 align:middle line:84%
We can't regrow it fast enough,
if we were to start today.

00:38:44.980 --> 00:38:49.570 align:middle line:84%
So now, how do you look at that
in the sense of perfection?

00:38:49.570 --> 00:38:52.690 align:middle line:84%
>> CHRISTOPHER: Well,
the question then arises

00:38:52.690 --> 00:38:55.370 align:middle line:84%
in my mind-- and a similar
thing happens when I think about

00:38:55.370 --> 00:38:57.840 align:middle line:84%
the plastic that's
in the oceans.

00:38:57.840 --> 00:39:01.450 align:middle line:84%
And there's a part of me
that is devastated by it.

00:39:01.450 --> 00:39:04.460 align:middle line:84%
And there's another
part that thinks,

00:39:04.460 --> 00:39:08.190 align:middle line:84%
what is the web of life
going to do with this?

00:39:08.190 --> 00:39:14.240 align:middle line:84%
Is it going to do something
with this catastrophe?

00:39:14.240 --> 00:39:20.579 align:middle line:84%
And it's behaved as if it knows
what it's doing for so long.

00:39:20.579 --> 00:39:22.370 align:middle line:84%
There's a part of me
that thinks that there

00:39:22.370 --> 00:39:25.090 align:middle line:84%
will be a new kind
of consciousness that

00:39:25.090 --> 00:39:26.810 align:middle line:90%
arises within humanity.

00:39:26.810 --> 00:39:29.610 align:middle line:84%
Perhaps we needed to
go through this stage.

00:39:29.610 --> 00:39:32.690 align:middle line:84%
That modern mind, itself,
needed to go through almost

00:39:32.690 --> 00:39:36.480 align:middle line:84%
an adolescent stage
and actually face

00:39:36.480 --> 00:39:39.580 align:middle line:84%
the reality of
death, which is often

00:39:39.580 --> 00:39:42.300 align:middle line:84%
a marker between
adolescence and adulthood is

00:39:42.300 --> 00:39:44.940 align:middle line:84%
facing the fact that
you could die here.

00:39:44.940 --> 00:39:52.330 align:middle line:84%
A lot of initiatory rituals
in cultures of ancient mind

00:39:52.330 --> 00:39:56.010 align:middle line:84%
had initiations that
you actually might die.

00:39:56.010 --> 00:39:58.080 align:middle line:90%
You might not actually survive.

00:39:58.080 --> 00:40:00.670 align:middle line:84%
And it's through that
fire of initiation,

00:40:00.670 --> 00:40:03.220 align:middle line:84%
it's quite possible that
when we wake up and realize,

00:40:03.220 --> 00:40:06.420 align:middle line:84%
my God, what have we
done, that we might--

00:40:06.420 --> 00:40:10.030 align:middle line:84%
that might bring us to a
new level of awareness,

00:40:10.030 --> 00:40:15.790 align:middle line:84%
and perhaps new ways of
being, and new-- at one point,

00:40:15.790 --> 00:40:18.940 align:middle line:84%
the Sage says, just like the
monarch caterpillar, whose

00:40:18.940 --> 00:40:21.270 align:middle line:84%
whole universe is
an entire tree,

00:40:21.270 --> 00:40:24.040 align:middle line:84%
has no idea what's
going to happen when

00:40:24.040 --> 00:40:25.969 align:middle line:90%
she springs wings and flies off.

00:40:25.969 --> 00:40:27.010 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: And who knows?

00:40:27.010 --> 00:40:31.030 align:middle line:84%
I mean, I brought this up in
one other interview recently,

00:40:31.030 --> 00:40:34.210 align:middle line:84%
because I was contemplating
the same thing you are.

00:40:34.210 --> 00:40:37.810 align:middle line:84%
And in Edgar Cayce's readings
from more than a half

00:40:37.810 --> 00:40:40.560 align:middle line:84%
a century ago, it
talked about a time

00:40:40.560 --> 00:40:45.460 align:middle line:84%
when Japan would suffer from
deep radiation poisoning,

00:40:45.460 --> 00:40:48.440 align:middle line:84%
and many of the life forms
around would be killed off.

00:40:48.440 --> 00:40:51.180 align:middle line:84%
Now, if you're
looking at the fact

00:40:51.180 --> 00:40:53.430 align:middle line:84%
that he was somewhere
between 80 and 90%

00:40:53.430 --> 00:40:57.470 align:middle line:84%
accurate on his visions,
then where was radiation,

00:40:57.470 --> 00:41:00.420 align:middle line:84%
as part of our future, already
starting to accumulate?

00:41:00.420 --> 00:41:02.370 align:middle line:84%
This was, I believe,
before we even

00:41:02.370 --> 00:41:05.150 align:middle line:84%
had the H-bomb,
A-bomb, and so forth.

00:41:05.150 --> 00:41:10.430 align:middle line:84%
So is it possible that, as
we're depleting on oxygen,

00:41:10.430 --> 00:41:14.790 align:middle line:84%
that the increase in
radiation of different kinds

00:41:14.790 --> 00:41:18.410 align:middle line:84%
is actually going to create
a new adaptation in all life

00:41:18.410 --> 00:41:19.540 align:middle line:90%
forms on the planet?

00:41:19.540 --> 00:41:22.540 align:middle line:84%
Is it possible just looking at
this poisonous oxygen analogy?

00:41:22.540 --> 00:41:24.160 align:middle line:90%
>> CHRISTOPHER: Well, it is.

00:41:24.160 --> 00:41:25.390 align:middle line:90%
It's not only possible.

00:41:25.390 --> 00:41:28.800 align:middle line:84%
That's what's going to happen,
if we have this enormous influx

00:41:28.800 --> 00:41:33.650 align:middle line:84%
of radiation that is
happening in Fukushima.

00:41:33.650 --> 00:41:39.410 align:middle line:84%
If we have the chemistry of
Earth changing, by definition,

00:41:39.410 --> 00:41:42.520 align:middle line:84%
evolution is going
to work its magic.

00:41:42.520 --> 00:41:45.720 align:middle line:84%
Now, whether or not
it is a collapse,

00:41:45.720 --> 00:41:50.060 align:middle line:84%
like as what happened 65 million
years ago when the asteroid hit

00:41:50.060 --> 00:41:53.090 align:middle line:84%
Earth, if it's a collapse,
that's one thing.

00:41:53.090 --> 00:41:56.840 align:middle line:84%
And there's a part of me
that it feels heartbreaking.

00:41:56.840 --> 00:42:00.160 align:middle line:84%
Do we really need to create a
collapse to go through that?

00:42:00.160 --> 00:42:02.000 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: Or we
might just adapt.

00:42:02.000 --> 00:42:03.880 align:middle line:84%
>> CHRISTOPHER: Or
we might just adapt.

00:42:03.880 --> 00:42:07.960 align:middle line:84%
It's quite possible that--
well, certainly we will adapt.

00:42:07.960 --> 00:42:12.350 align:middle line:84%
But there's a part of it
feels-- there's a part

00:42:12.350 --> 00:42:15.410 align:middle line:84%
of the symposium-- the
Pachamama Alliance symposium--

00:42:15.410 --> 00:42:20.535 align:middle line:84%
that talks about the sacred
talismanic fellow creatures

00:42:20.535 --> 00:42:22.594 align:middle line:84%
of ours that we're
about to lose forever--

00:42:22.594 --> 00:42:24.135 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: Yeah,
that is devastating.

00:42:24.135 --> 00:42:28.650 align:middle line:84%
>> CHRISTOPHER: --the tigers,
the elephants, the gorillas,

00:42:28.650 --> 00:42:32.590 align:middle line:84%
the higher, what we call
more complex forms of life,

00:42:32.590 --> 00:42:34.090 align:middle line:84%
which might be a
bit of a prejudice.

00:42:34.090 --> 00:42:38.570 align:middle line:84%
But at any rate, we're about
to lose these partners forever.

00:42:38.570 --> 00:42:40.760 align:middle line:90%
And they won't come back.

00:42:40.760 --> 00:42:42.520 align:middle line:84%
And there's a part
of me that just,

00:42:42.520 --> 00:42:46.630 align:middle line:84%
when I see the cheetah running
across the screen, and saying

00:42:46.630 --> 00:42:48.930 align:middle line:90%
will this be the last time?

00:42:48.930 --> 00:42:53.390 align:middle line:84%
Will the only cheetah be
that we see is in a book?

00:42:53.390 --> 00:42:56.690 align:middle line:84%
It rends my heart, as
much as it rends my heart

00:42:56.690 --> 00:42:59.136 align:middle line:84%
to see the vastness
of the slums--

00:42:59.136 --> 00:43:00.510 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: Yes,
it's devastating.

00:43:00.510 --> 00:43:03.564 align:middle line:84%
>> CHRISTOPHER: --in
part of our cultures.

00:43:03.564 --> 00:43:04.730 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: It's devastating.

00:43:04.730 --> 00:43:06.313 align:middle line:84%
>> CHRISTOPHER: So
yes, we will adapt.

00:43:06.313 --> 00:43:08.820 align:middle line:90%
There will be an adaptation.

00:43:08.820 --> 00:43:11.310 align:middle line:84%
Certainly our civilizations
will not continue as they are.

00:43:11.310 --> 00:43:11.880 align:middle line:90%
They can't.

00:43:11.880 --> 00:43:13.320 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: No, they can't.

00:43:13.320 --> 00:43:15.080 align:middle line:84%
I think I've done
probably a hundred plus

00:43:15.080 --> 00:43:16.860 align:middle line:84%
interviews on that
subject alone.

00:43:16.860 --> 00:43:18.110 align:middle line:90%
It can't continue that way.

00:43:18.110 --> 00:43:20.720 align:middle line:84%
>> CHRISTOPHER: But whether
we will survive as a species,

00:43:20.720 --> 00:43:21.552 align:middle line:90%
quite likely.

00:43:21.552 --> 00:43:22.510 align:middle line:90%
We're pretty resilient.

00:43:22.510 --> 00:43:23.450 align:middle line:90%
We're smart.

00:43:23.450 --> 00:43:25.042 align:middle line:90%
But there's no guarantees.

00:43:25.042 --> 00:43:26.000 align:middle line:90%
And the Sage says that.

00:43:26.000 --> 00:43:27.330 align:middle line:90%
There's no guarantees.

00:43:27.330 --> 00:43:28.699 align:middle line:90%
Why take the risk?

00:43:28.699 --> 00:43:29.490 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: I agree.

00:43:29.490 --> 00:43:31.750 align:middle line:84%
And then, for me, there's
always a silver lining.

00:43:31.750 --> 00:43:33.760 align:middle line:84%
Because I'm always
going for as far out as

00:43:33.760 --> 00:43:35.680 align:middle line:90%
I can conceive of, anyway.

00:43:35.680 --> 00:43:38.680 align:middle line:84%
And the notion that,
if our planet has

00:43:38.680 --> 00:43:43.220 align:middle line:84%
gone through a sub-dimensional
or a dimensional shift

00:43:43.220 --> 00:43:47.620 align:middle line:84%
during this last period of
time that is in process,

00:43:47.620 --> 00:43:50.720 align:middle line:84%
is it possible whatever
existed in the purely

00:43:50.720 --> 00:43:55.140 align:middle line:84%
third-dimensional aspect, is
no longer essentially necessary

00:43:55.140 --> 00:43:55.640 align:middle line:90%
there?

00:43:55.640 --> 00:43:58.030 align:middle line:84%
But maybe it's already
existing into a higher

00:43:58.030 --> 00:43:59.370 align:middle line:90%
dimensional field?

00:43:59.370 --> 00:44:02.160 align:middle line:84%
Is it possible that even
some of these species

00:44:02.160 --> 00:44:05.479 align:middle line:84%
have evolved themselves
into-- along with the planet--

00:44:05.479 --> 00:44:07.770 align:middle line:84%
into this higher level of
functioning, maybe elsewhere,

00:44:07.770 --> 00:44:10.285 align:middle line:84%
maybe visible on a
screen elsewhere?

00:44:10.285 --> 00:44:11.160 align:middle line:90%
That's like the big--

00:44:11.160 --> 00:44:12.201 align:middle line:90%
>> CHRISTOPHER: Possible.

00:44:12.201 --> 00:44:15.580 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: --far-out place I go
to look at what it is possible

00:44:15.580 --> 00:44:19.040 align:middle line:84%
in all of this besides the
physical 3 or 4D reality

00:44:19.040 --> 00:44:19.610 align:middle line:90%
we're in.

00:44:19.610 --> 00:44:20.860 align:middle line:90%
>> CHRISTOPHER: And who knows?

00:44:20.860 --> 00:44:23.420 align:middle line:84%
I mean one of the topics
that the Sage talks

00:44:23.420 --> 00:44:27.407 align:middle line:84%
about is that there, perhaps,
when birds are calling

00:44:27.407 --> 00:44:29.240 align:middle line:84%
and when animals are
calling to one another,

00:44:29.240 --> 00:44:31.776 align:middle line:84%
maybe they're not just doing
it for evolutionary purposes.

00:44:31.776 --> 00:44:33.275 align:middle line:84%
Maybe they're telling
their stories.

00:44:33.275 --> 00:44:34.260 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: That's right.

00:44:34.260 --> 00:44:36.759 align:middle line:84%
>> CHRISTOPHER: Maybe there's
a consciousness of the plants,

00:44:36.759 --> 00:44:39.800 align:middle line:84%
which have been here for
hundreds of million of years.

00:44:39.800 --> 00:44:41.460 align:middle line:84%
Maybe they have
something to teach us.

00:44:41.460 --> 00:44:42.550 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: You think?

00:44:42.550 --> 00:44:45.195 align:middle line:84%
Seeing as how they're our
greatest healing allies.

00:44:45.195 --> 00:44:46.070 align:middle line:90%
>> CHRISTOPHER: Yeah.

00:44:46.070 --> 00:44:51.730 align:middle line:84%
And it's going to take an
amazing shift in consciousness

00:44:51.730 --> 00:44:58.450 align:middle line:84%
to really see how interdependent
we are on the biosphere.

00:44:58.450 --> 00:45:04.490 align:middle line:84%
And it's astonishing
at how little that

00:45:04.490 --> 00:45:07.760 align:middle line:84%
penetrates in the
common culture.

00:45:07.760 --> 00:45:10.240 align:middle line:84%
And it's also
astonishing to see how

00:45:10.240 --> 00:45:13.095 align:middle line:84%
things are shifting
in the common culture.

00:45:13.095 --> 00:45:14.045 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: It is.

00:45:14.045 --> 00:45:17.500 align:middle line:84%
I see more shift than
maybe some people

00:45:17.500 --> 00:45:18.930 align:middle line:90%
do because I'm looking for it.

00:45:18.930 --> 00:45:20.460 align:middle line:90%
I agree that that's part of it.

00:45:20.460 --> 00:45:23.870 align:middle line:84%
But also just at large,
conversations with strangers,

00:45:23.870 --> 00:45:25.220 align:middle line:90%
I do have hope.

00:45:25.220 --> 00:45:26.970 align:middle line:84%
Now, granted it's
still not the majority

00:45:26.970 --> 00:45:29.650 align:middle line:84%
of the human
population, but there

00:45:29.650 --> 00:45:33.700 align:middle line:84%
is an exponential increase
in awareness that I'm seeing.

00:45:33.700 --> 00:45:36.980 align:middle line:84%
>> CHRISTOPHER: And there's a
wonderful little metaphor that

00:45:36.980 --> 00:45:41.060 align:middle line:84%
I borrowed from the symposium
that talks about how,

00:45:41.060 --> 00:45:45.590 align:middle line:84%
when a caterpillar goes into
the metamorphosis state,

00:45:45.590 --> 00:45:47.680 align:middle line:84%
there are cells called
the imaginal cells--

00:45:47.680 --> 00:45:51.230 align:middle line:84%
and I think Elizabet Sahtouris
was the one who coined

00:45:51.230 --> 00:45:55.320 align:middle line:84%
the term-- that
start to take over.

00:45:55.320 --> 00:45:59.450 align:middle line:90%
And they begin to separate.

00:45:59.450 --> 00:46:02.210 align:middle line:84%
Their genetic instructions
start to take over.

00:46:02.210 --> 00:46:04.490 align:middle line:90%
And the amazing thing...

00:46:04.490 --> 00:46:07.480 align:middle line:84%
part about it is that the
immune system of the caterpillar

00:46:07.480 --> 00:46:11.020 align:middle line:84%
begins to attack it
as a foreign body.

00:46:11.020 --> 00:46:13.000 align:middle line:84%
And it's a wonderful
metaphor for those

00:46:13.000 --> 00:46:17.002 align:middle line:84%
who are waking up, that if
you're starting to be attacked,

00:46:17.002 --> 00:46:18.460 align:middle line:84%
you're probably on
the right track.

00:46:18.460 --> 00:46:19.520 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Exactly.

00:46:19.520 --> 00:46:23.760 align:middle line:84%
And just on a closing note,
because it seems appropriate.

00:46:23.760 --> 00:46:26.230 align:middle line:84%
About a week ago,
a friend handed me

00:46:26.230 --> 00:46:30.450 align:middle line:84%
a little bottle of palo
santo essential oil,

00:46:30.450 --> 00:46:31.420 align:middle line:90%
which I've never used.

00:46:31.420 --> 00:46:33.429 align:middle line:90%
And I love essential oils.

00:46:33.429 --> 00:46:35.470 align:middle line:84%
And he said you might want
to meditate with this.

00:46:35.470 --> 00:46:36.530 align:middle line:90%
I thought, really?

00:46:36.530 --> 00:46:37.230 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:46:37.230 --> 00:46:40.730 align:middle line:84%
So I rubbed a little dot
here, and it was profound.

00:46:40.730 --> 00:46:46.230 align:middle line:84%
And what I saw is, within
less than a minute,

00:46:46.230 --> 00:46:49.750 align:middle line:84%
my awareness was inside a tree,
following it down to the roots,

00:46:49.750 --> 00:46:51.620 align:middle line:84%
and then to the
fungi on the roots,

00:46:51.620 --> 00:46:53.010 align:middle line:90%
and then to the world of fungi.

00:46:53.010 --> 00:46:55.960 align:middle line:84%
And that kingdom just
started talking, so to speak.

00:46:55.960 --> 00:46:59.180 align:middle line:84%
And I didn't ingest anything,
just a little drop right here.

00:46:59.180 --> 00:47:02.110 align:middle line:84%
And it started showing me
that we haven't been paying

00:47:02.110 --> 00:47:05.260 align:middle line:84%
close enough attention
to the world of mycelium,

00:47:05.260 --> 00:47:07.550 align:middle line:84%
that the world of
fungus is actually

00:47:07.550 --> 00:47:10.200 align:middle line:84%
going to be bridging us
over, through the state

00:47:10.200 --> 00:47:14.420 align:middle line:84%
of our evolution and adaptation,
and many, many life forms

00:47:14.420 --> 00:47:16.950 align:middle line:84%
on Earth, not humans,
all life forms on Earth--

00:47:16.950 --> 00:47:20.310 align:middle line:84%
that the mycelium was
going to act as a bridge.

00:47:20.310 --> 00:47:22.790 align:middle line:84%
And it has this
innate intelligence

00:47:22.790 --> 00:47:25.890 align:middle line:84%
that is profound and beyond
what we ordinarily think.

00:47:25.890 --> 00:47:29.110 align:middle line:84%
We just think of them in terms
of magic mushrooms, Psilocybin,

00:47:29.110 --> 00:47:30.630 align:middle line:90%
and highs and that.

00:47:30.630 --> 00:47:33.690 align:middle line:84%
No, it was showing me
that in microscopic form,

00:47:33.690 --> 00:47:36.760 align:middle line:84%
to these large vast
areas of interconnected

00:47:36.760 --> 00:47:39.320 align:middle line:84%
fungi under the ground,
that that was going

00:47:39.320 --> 00:47:42.745 align:middle line:84%
to be a partner in our now
future evolution and help

00:47:42.745 --> 00:47:46.930 align:middle line:84%
remediate, also, some of the
effects of the radiation on all

00:47:46.930 --> 00:47:48.020 align:middle line:90%
of the life forms here.

00:47:48.020 --> 00:47:50.060 align:middle line:84%
And so I started
calling up people,

00:47:50.060 --> 00:47:52.155 align:middle line:84%
like Compton Rom, Barbara
Hand Clow, and others

00:47:52.155 --> 00:47:54.460 align:middle line:84%
that are saying,
yes, that's true.

00:47:54.460 --> 00:47:56.297 align:middle line:84%
And told me some more,
so I have great hope.

00:47:56.297 --> 00:47:57.505 align:middle line:90%
>> CHRISTOPHER: Paul Stamets.

00:47:57.505 --> 00:47:57.995 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: Paul
Stamets, absolutely.

00:47:57.995 --> 00:47:59.090 align:middle line:84%
>> CHRISTOPHER: The little
guys are working on it.

00:47:59.090 --> 00:48:00.964 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: The little
guys are working on it,

00:48:00.964 --> 00:48:01.955 align:middle line:90%
even if we are not.

00:48:01.955 --> 00:48:04.060 align:middle line:84%
And on that, I just
have to say thank

00:48:04.060 --> 00:48:05.900 align:middle line:84%
you so much for
doing what you did.

00:48:05.900 --> 00:48:06.280 align:middle line:84%
>> CHRISTOPHER: Well,
thank you so much.

00:48:06.280 --> 00:48:08.990 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: And it's a very
beautiful piece of work.

00:48:08.990 --> 00:48:09.360 align:middle line:90%
>> CHRISTOPHER: All right.

00:48:09.360 --> 00:48:09.859 align:middle line:90%
Thank you.

00:48:09.859 --> 00:48:11.540 align:middle line:90%
I appreciate it.

00:48:11.540 --> 00:48:14.360 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: Elegant and profound,
this book is a beautiful way

00:48:14.360 --> 00:48:16.740 align:middle line:84%
to introduce meaningful
discussion to people that are

00:48:16.740 --> 00:48:19.980 align:middle line:84%
spiritual, but do not belong
to a religious ideology,

00:48:19.980 --> 00:48:21.850 align:middle line:90%
and maybe not even scientific.

00:48:21.850 --> 00:48:24.600 align:middle line:84%
Again, the book is titled
"The Holy Universe."

00:48:24.600 --> 00:48:26.570 align:middle line:84%
And many of today's
top minds are giving it

00:48:26.570 --> 00:48:28.360 align:middle line:90%
high praise, which it deserves.

00:48:28.360 --> 00:48:31.836 align:middle line:84%
Until next time, thank you for
joining us here on Gaiam TV.

00:48:31.836 --> 00:48:50.734 align:middle line:90%
