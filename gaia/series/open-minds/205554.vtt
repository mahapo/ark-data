00:00:09.230 --> 00:00:11.660 align:middle line:84%
>>BILL MCKENNA: So
Liz was actually

00:00:11.660 --> 00:00:13.130 align:middle line:90%
trying to manifest something.

00:00:13.130 --> 00:00:16.730 align:middle line:84%
She was like, I wonder if
that exists in my field.

00:00:16.730 --> 00:00:19.850 align:middle line:84%
She was like, if it was
somewhere, where would it be?

00:00:19.850 --> 00:00:22.070 align:middle line:90%
And she reached out her hand--

00:00:22.070 --> 00:00:24.380 align:middle line:84%
she physically felt
it with her hand.

00:00:24.380 --> 00:00:27.210 align:middle line:84%
Our mind is the energy
field around us,

00:00:27.210 --> 00:00:30.680 align:middle line:84%
and it also carries all
of this information.

00:00:30.680 --> 00:00:33.065 align:middle line:84%
If it's in the field, it's
from the past or future.

00:00:33.065 --> 00:00:34.440 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA MEREDITH:
Yeah, exactly.

00:00:34.440 --> 00:00:37.670 align:middle line:84%
>>MCKENNA: And if it's
in the chakras, it's now.

00:00:37.670 --> 00:00:39.980 align:middle line:84%
Think of whatever that
biggest thing that you want to

00:00:39.980 --> 00:00:41.030 align:middle line:90%
manifest.

00:00:41.030 --> 00:00:45.380 align:middle line:84%
Just relax and ask yourself,
if it was somewhere,

00:00:45.380 --> 00:00:46.190 align:middle line:90%
where would it be?

00:00:46.190 --> 00:00:50.840 align:middle line:90%


00:00:50.840 --> 00:00:52.370 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: There is
magical thinking,

00:00:52.370 --> 00:00:55.190 align:middle line:84%
and then there is
true functional magic.

00:00:55.190 --> 00:00:58.340 align:middle line:84%
Bill McKenna is back with us
to share his latest discoveries

00:00:58.340 --> 00:01:01.550 align:middle line:84%
that may seem magical, but
are in truth practical uses

00:01:01.550 --> 00:01:03.650 align:middle line:84%
of directing energies
with the mind

00:01:03.650 --> 00:01:05.510 align:middle line:90%
for healing and manifestation.

00:01:05.510 --> 00:01:07.693 align:middle line:84%
He's always discovering
new applications

00:01:07.693 --> 00:01:09.110 align:middle line:84%
for directing
energy, and is going

00:01:09.110 --> 00:01:13.580 align:middle line:84%
to share a method for clearing
cling-ons from our aura.

00:01:13.580 --> 00:01:15.830 align:middle line:90%
And much more, right?

00:01:15.830 --> 00:01:17.060 align:middle line:90%
>>MCKENNA: Yes, a lot more.

00:01:17.060 --> 00:01:19.730 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Yeah,
you're always pushing

00:01:19.730 --> 00:01:23.390 align:middle line:84%
the envelope of discovery to
see what can be done with mind.

00:01:23.390 --> 00:01:25.295 align:middle line:90%
And you have a whole new thing.

00:01:25.295 --> 00:01:27.920 align:middle line:84%
That's why you're back, because
everybody loves what you offer.

00:01:27.920 --> 00:01:29.530 align:middle line:84%
And now you have
yet something new.

00:01:29.530 --> 00:01:31.220 align:middle line:90%
So let's just jump into it.

00:01:31.220 --> 00:01:34.700 align:middle line:84%
And off camera, before, when
I was prepping for this,

00:01:34.700 --> 00:01:36.800 align:middle line:84%
we were talking on the
phone, and you were

00:01:36.800 --> 00:01:39.650 align:middle line:90%
talking about using clapping.

00:01:39.650 --> 00:01:42.680 align:middle line:84%
You found this clapping
technique, right?

00:01:42.680 --> 00:01:44.510 align:middle line:84%
And I thought,
well, Bill, that's

00:01:44.510 --> 00:01:46.370 align:middle line:84%
what they use to
clear entities out

00:01:46.370 --> 00:01:49.970 align:middle line:84%
of spaces in, say, Bali and
some of the other countries.

00:01:49.970 --> 00:01:51.840 align:middle line:90%
You said, I didn't know that.

00:01:51.840 --> 00:01:54.960 align:middle line:84%
So this is something that you
kind of discovered on your own.

00:01:54.960 --> 00:01:56.660 align:middle line:84%
So let's just dive
right in from where

00:01:56.660 --> 00:01:59.960 align:middle line:84%
we were to what you're
offering us by way

00:01:59.960 --> 00:02:01.620 align:middle line:90%
of practical knowledge today.

00:02:01.620 --> 00:02:02.890 align:middle line:90%
>>MCKENNA: OK, all right.

00:02:02.890 --> 00:02:07.090 align:middle line:10%
So I have to back up
just one or two steps.

00:02:07.090 --> 00:02:12.040 align:middle line:10%
Now, I credit my business
partner, Liz Larson,

00:02:12.040 --> 00:02:13.720 align:middle line:10%
with this discovery.

00:02:13.720 --> 00:02:19.840 align:middle line:84%
So Liz was actually trying
to manifest something.

00:02:19.840 --> 00:02:22.660 align:middle line:90%
And she is very curious.

00:02:22.660 --> 00:02:26.830 align:middle line:84%
She was like, I wonder if
that exists in my field.

00:02:26.830 --> 00:02:28.750 align:middle line:84%
And she reached out
her hand and she

00:02:28.750 --> 00:02:31.600 align:middle line:84%
was like, if it was
somewhere, where would it be?

00:02:31.600 --> 00:02:34.780 align:middle line:84%
And she reached out her
hand, and all of a sudden,

00:02:34.780 --> 00:02:35.950 align:middle line:90%
she felt it.

00:02:35.950 --> 00:02:39.190 align:middle line:84%
And this was not like,
oh, I'm imagining.

00:02:39.190 --> 00:02:41.032 align:middle line:84%
She physically felt
it with her hand.

00:02:41.032 --> 00:02:42.490 align:middle line:10%
>>REGINA: And you're
talking-- now,

00:02:42.490 --> 00:02:45.520 align:middle line:10%
you're saying the thing
that she wanted to manifest,

00:02:45.520 --> 00:02:47.720 align:middle line:10%
that we always think
is outside of us--

00:02:47.720 --> 00:02:48.520 align:middle line:10%
>>MCKENNA: Correct.

00:02:48.520 --> 00:02:51.310 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: OK, so
she's saying, I wonder

00:02:51.310 --> 00:02:53.530 align:middle line:90%
if it's actually already in me.

00:02:53.530 --> 00:02:55.780 align:middle line:84%
Which is a really good
question because why else would

00:02:55.780 --> 00:02:57.238 align:middle line:84%
you want to manifest
it unless it's

00:02:57.238 --> 00:02:59.830 align:middle line:84%
something that's already
been somehow inculcated

00:02:59.830 --> 00:03:01.270 align:middle line:90%
into your being?

00:03:01.270 --> 00:03:06.310 align:middle line:84%
>>MCKENNA: Yeah, you're
interested in having that.

00:03:06.310 --> 00:03:08.050 align:middle line:90%
And so there she is.

00:03:08.050 --> 00:03:11.510 align:middle line:84%
She actually reached out
and touched it and felt it.

00:03:11.510 --> 00:03:14.230 align:middle line:84%
She was like, oh, my gosh,
I could feel the sides of it

00:03:14.230 --> 00:03:15.940 align:middle line:90%
and the top of it.

00:03:15.940 --> 00:03:21.730 align:middle line:84%
And then she was
like, I wonder--

00:03:21.730 --> 00:03:25.600 align:middle line:84%
also that thing that's keeping
me from manifesting it--

00:03:25.600 --> 00:03:26.800 align:middle line:90%
her fear--

00:03:26.800 --> 00:03:29.680 align:middle line:84%
and she was like, I wonder
if I could feel that,

00:03:29.680 --> 00:03:32.170 align:middle line:90%
and where would it be?

00:03:32.170 --> 00:03:34.300 align:middle line:90%
Oh, my gosh, there it is.

00:03:34.300 --> 00:03:36.670 align:middle line:90%
And she felt it with her hand.

00:03:36.670 --> 00:03:38.790 align:middle line:84%
Well, she calls me up
right away and says,

00:03:38.790 --> 00:03:41.170 align:middle line:90%
hey, I don't know about this.

00:03:41.170 --> 00:03:42.520 align:middle line:90%
You try.

00:03:42.520 --> 00:03:44.770 align:middle line:90%
And I was like, OK, I'll try.

00:03:44.770 --> 00:03:49.903 align:middle line:84%
And I-- OK, and I was like,
oh, my gosh, there it is.

00:03:49.903 --> 00:03:51.820 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: You were trying
to look at something

00:03:51.820 --> 00:03:53.540 align:middle line:90%
that you wanted to manifest.

00:03:53.540 --> 00:03:54.340 align:middle line:90%
>>MCKENNA: Right.

00:03:54.340 --> 00:03:57.650 align:middle line:84%
And so I said, oh, my gosh,
there is something there.

00:03:57.650 --> 00:04:01.780 align:middle line:84%
So that was the beginning
of it, where it was strictly

00:04:01.780 --> 00:04:04.312 align:middle line:90%
just a curiosity.

00:04:04.312 --> 00:04:05.770 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Then you
started playing.

00:04:05.770 --> 00:04:06.610 align:middle line:84%
>>MCKENNA: I started
playing with it.

00:04:06.610 --> 00:04:08.485 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: But Bill, this
makes perfect sense.

00:04:08.485 --> 00:04:10.540 align:middle line:84%
And we're going to go
through the various steps

00:04:10.540 --> 00:04:11.815 align:middle line:90%
of manifestation.

00:04:11.815 --> 00:04:12.940 align:middle line:90%
But it makes perfect sense.

00:04:12.940 --> 00:04:16.329 align:middle line:84%
By the time your
conscious mind has it,

00:04:16.329 --> 00:04:19.630 align:middle line:84%
you're already beginning the
process of manifestation.

00:04:19.630 --> 00:04:20.440 align:middle line:90%
>>MCKENNA: Oh, yes.

00:04:20.440 --> 00:04:20.800 align:middle line:90%
Yes, you are.

00:04:20.800 --> 00:04:22.780 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And that
means it would then

00:04:22.780 --> 00:04:26.860 align:middle line:84%
be within your auric field
or your energetic matrix.

00:04:26.860 --> 00:04:28.540 align:middle line:90%
>>MCKENNA: That is correct, yes.

00:04:28.540 --> 00:04:32.470 align:middle line:84%
We think about it,
and then it actually

00:04:32.470 --> 00:04:34.130 align:middle line:90%
starts developing in our field.

00:04:34.130 --> 00:04:34.930 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:04:34.930 --> 00:04:37.600 align:middle line:84%
I had a wonderful
meditation many years ago,

00:04:37.600 --> 00:04:40.550 align:middle line:84%
and said, what are the
upper chakras all about?

00:04:40.550 --> 00:04:45.070 align:middle line:84%
And it turned out, I was shown
a vision of how they work.

00:04:45.070 --> 00:04:48.370 align:middle line:84%
The step down effect, how
creation and manifestation

00:04:48.370 --> 00:04:50.710 align:middle line:84%
works, right up to what
we call the eighth chakra,

00:04:50.710 --> 00:04:53.530 align:middle line:84%
and then dropping into
our physical reality.

00:04:53.530 --> 00:04:56.470 align:middle line:84%
Later, I read "Physics of
the Soul" by Amit Goswami.

00:04:56.470 --> 00:05:00.250 align:middle line:84%
He described it a very similar
way, which totally validates

00:05:00.250 --> 00:05:01.480 align:middle line:90%
what you're talking about.

00:05:01.480 --> 00:05:02.020 align:middle line:90%
>>MCKENNA: Oh, my God.

00:05:02.020 --> 00:05:03.010 align:middle line:90%
I didn't know.

00:05:03.010 --> 00:05:04.870 align:middle line:90%
That's awesome.

00:05:04.870 --> 00:05:06.370 align:middle line:84%
Yeah, we're going
to get into that.

00:05:06.370 --> 00:05:07.912 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: We're
going to get into it.

00:05:07.912 --> 00:05:11.110 align:middle line:84%
OK, so oftentimes when
we don't manifest,

00:05:11.110 --> 00:05:14.050 align:middle line:84%
it's because we have
some unresolved issues.

00:05:14.050 --> 00:05:15.068 align:middle line:90%
>>MCKENNA: Absolutely.

00:05:15.068 --> 00:05:16.360 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: And we all have them.

00:05:16.360 --> 00:05:16.810 align:middle line:90%
>>MCKENNA: Yes.

00:05:16.810 --> 00:05:18.643 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So let's get
into that part of it.

00:05:18.643 --> 00:05:20.200 align:middle line:90%
Let's start with the blocks.

00:05:20.200 --> 00:05:21.670 align:middle line:90%
>>MCKENNA: Oh, yeah.

00:05:21.670 --> 00:05:26.110 align:middle line:84%
So if you didn't
have any fear at all,

00:05:26.110 --> 00:05:30.100 align:middle line:84%
this thing would have
already manifested.

00:05:30.100 --> 00:05:35.470 align:middle line:84%
Our fears, our concerns
over whatever keeps it

00:05:35.470 --> 00:05:40.450 align:middle line:84%
out in our field and away from
this downgrade process that

00:05:40.450 --> 00:05:42.620 align:middle line:90%
ends up taking place.

00:05:42.620 --> 00:05:46.720 align:middle line:84%
So it's fairly simple
now that I know about it,

00:05:46.720 --> 00:05:49.690 align:middle line:84%
now that I've been able
to do it and teach it

00:05:49.690 --> 00:05:50.765 align:middle line:90%
and that sort of thing.

00:05:50.765 --> 00:05:52.390 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: But yeah,
it dogs most people

00:05:52.390 --> 00:05:54.100 align:middle line:84%
because they have
no idea how you even

00:05:54.100 --> 00:05:56.920 align:middle line:90%
go about identifying it.

00:05:56.920 --> 00:06:00.290 align:middle line:84%
So you say that's also
living in the field.

00:06:00.290 --> 00:06:02.380 align:middle line:84%
>>MCKENNA: Yes, it's
actually living in the field.

00:06:02.380 --> 00:06:05.950 align:middle line:84%
What is in conflict
with my manifestation?

00:06:05.950 --> 00:06:08.557 align:middle line:84%
And for most of us, we'll
be like, what do you mean?

00:06:08.557 --> 00:06:09.640 align:middle line:90%
I want to win the lottery.

00:06:09.640 --> 00:06:11.440 align:middle line:84%
Yeah, no, I don't
have any blocks.

00:06:11.440 --> 00:06:13.360 align:middle line:84%
Well, somewhere,
there's a thing,

00:06:13.360 --> 00:06:17.560 align:middle line:84%
like, oh, my family's going
to ask me for all the money,

00:06:17.560 --> 00:06:19.690 align:middle line:84%
oh, I'm going to end up
like one of those people

00:06:19.690 --> 00:06:22.450 align:middle line:90%
that everything bad happens to.

00:06:22.450 --> 00:06:23.270 align:middle line:90%
Whatever.

00:06:23.270 --> 00:06:25.130 align:middle line:84%
But that'll be
out in your field,

00:06:25.130 --> 00:06:27.478 align:middle line:84%
and it'll be blocking that
coming in and manifesting.

00:06:27.478 --> 00:06:29.020 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Plus the
fact that you have

00:06:29.020 --> 00:06:32.167 align:middle line:84%
maybe 30 million other people
competing for the same lottery

00:06:32.167 --> 00:06:33.250 align:middle line:90%
win with that much desire.

00:06:33.250 --> 00:06:35.380 align:middle line:84%
>>MCKENNA: There's a
lot of energy on that.

00:06:35.380 --> 00:06:38.050 align:middle line:84%
Yeah, there's a lot of
conflicting energies,

00:06:38.050 --> 00:06:39.130 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Oh, my God.

00:06:39.130 --> 00:06:41.890 align:middle line:84%
We could probably do a show
just on the whole notion

00:06:41.890 --> 00:06:46.180 align:middle line:84%
of luck, what people perceive as
luck, and winning the lottery--

00:06:46.180 --> 00:06:47.890 align:middle line:90%
winning it big game.

00:06:47.890 --> 00:06:50.440 align:middle line:84%
Where you're talking about
taking away millions.

00:06:50.440 --> 00:06:54.670 align:middle line:84%
The attachment, the desire,
the fear, the competition.

00:06:54.670 --> 00:06:57.160 align:middle line:84%
All of those energies
colliding together

00:06:57.160 --> 00:06:59.400 align:middle line:90%
in this soup of desire.

00:06:59.400 --> 00:07:00.200 align:middle line:90%
>>MCKENNA: Correct.

00:07:00.200 --> 00:07:01.190 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: And fear.

00:07:01.190 --> 00:07:01.990 align:middle line:90%
>>MCKENNA: Yes.

00:07:01.990 --> 00:07:03.320 align:middle line:90%
And fear.

00:07:03.320 --> 00:07:10.970 align:middle line:84%
So the good news is that we can
actually clear our field really

00:07:10.970 --> 00:07:15.390 align:middle line:84%
easily now that you
know where it is.

00:07:15.390 --> 00:07:19.280 align:middle line:84%
And in that conflict, you
just-- you already know.

00:07:19.280 --> 00:07:21.680 align:middle line:84%
If I say, you know
where is that?

00:07:21.680 --> 00:07:25.230 align:middle line:84%
If it was somewhere,
where would it be?

00:07:25.230 --> 00:07:27.403 align:middle line:84%
Well, it would
probably be about here.

00:07:27.403 --> 00:07:28.820 align:middle line:84%
And you reach out
and you actually

00:07:28.820 --> 00:07:31.370 align:middle line:84%
can feel it physically
with your hand.

00:07:31.370 --> 00:07:37.020 align:middle line:84%
And once that's done, you can
actually just clap right there.

00:07:37.020 --> 00:07:37.820 align:middle line:90%
And once you clap--

00:07:37.820 --> 00:07:39.770 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And say,
cling-on be gone.

00:07:39.770 --> 00:07:42.690 align:middle line:84%
>>MCKENNA: You don't
have to even anything.

00:07:42.690 --> 00:07:46.730 align:middle line:84%
You literally just clap, and
then you go back and feel,

00:07:46.730 --> 00:07:49.730 align:middle line:90%
and it's not there anymore.

00:07:49.730 --> 00:07:53.480 align:middle line:84%
The amount of
energy that we have

00:07:53.480 --> 00:07:56.990 align:middle line:84%
being physical and creating
a vibration with our hand

00:07:56.990 --> 00:08:01.100 align:middle line:84%
and clapping like
that, what happens is--

00:08:01.100 --> 00:08:04.430 align:middle line:84%
these thought forms,
these energy forms

00:08:04.430 --> 00:08:07.790 align:middle line:90%
are so fragile relative to that.

00:08:07.790 --> 00:08:08.750 align:middle line:90%
I didn't think that.

00:08:08.750 --> 00:08:11.390 align:middle line:84%
I thought, oh, my gosh,
this is overwhelming,

00:08:11.390 --> 00:08:13.890 align:middle line:84%
it's a dark energy, it's
going to take a lot.

00:08:13.890 --> 00:08:16.730 align:middle line:84%
And if you're trying to
deal with just with thought

00:08:16.730 --> 00:08:18.110 align:middle line:90%
and energy, it is.

00:08:18.110 --> 00:08:21.200 align:middle line:84%
But if you came at it
from the physical aspect

00:08:21.200 --> 00:08:22.500 align:middle line:90%
and just clapped--

00:08:22.500 --> 00:08:23.300 align:middle line:90%
poof.

00:08:23.300 --> 00:08:27.050 align:middle line:90%
And you literally will feel it.

00:08:27.050 --> 00:08:29.300 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: OK, so this is
what's coming up in my mind

00:08:29.300 --> 00:08:30.480 align:middle line:90%
as you're speaking.

00:08:30.480 --> 00:08:34.820 align:middle line:84%
So this challenge, whether
it be a person or a belief

00:08:34.820 --> 00:08:37.070 align:middle line:84%
or a fear that you've
self-generated,

00:08:37.070 --> 00:08:40.760 align:middle line:84%
you clap, and then you
can get it to dissipate.

00:08:40.760 --> 00:08:42.380 align:middle line:84%
What about the
thing that created

00:08:42.380 --> 00:08:45.020 align:middle line:84%
it to begin with in
the subconscious?

00:08:45.020 --> 00:08:48.170 align:middle line:84%
Isn't it going to try to
regenerate the same thing?

00:08:48.170 --> 00:08:49.250 align:middle line:90%
>>MCKENNA: Amazing.

00:08:49.250 --> 00:08:53.090 align:middle line:84%
An amazing thing--
so yes and no.

00:08:53.090 --> 00:08:58.290 align:middle line:84%
So on the yes side-- and the
yes is most of the time--

00:08:58.290 --> 00:09:03.740 align:middle line:84%
so we have our physical brain,
and then we have our mind.

00:09:03.740 --> 00:09:06.620 align:middle line:84%
Our mind is the energy
field around us,

00:09:06.620 --> 00:09:11.240 align:middle line:84%
and it also carries all
of this information.

00:09:11.240 --> 00:09:13.590 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: All subconscious
memory, everything.

00:09:13.590 --> 00:09:14.390 align:middle line:90%
Experience.

00:09:14.390 --> 00:09:18.330 align:middle line:84%
>>MCKENNA: All of it is
right there in that field.

00:09:18.330 --> 00:09:20.900 align:middle line:90%
So when people do this--

00:09:20.900 --> 00:09:23.180 align:middle line:90%
literally clap it out--

00:09:23.180 --> 00:09:27.410 align:middle line:84%
the most amazing--
it is so natural,

00:09:27.410 --> 00:09:29.090 align:middle line:84%
they just start to
feel differently.

00:09:29.090 --> 00:09:31.340 align:middle line:84%
I always ask them,
how do you feel now?

00:09:31.340 --> 00:09:33.440 align:middle line:84%
How do you how do you
feel about that now?

00:09:33.440 --> 00:09:35.010 align:middle line:90%
Even just a few minutes later--

00:09:35.010 --> 00:09:38.420 align:middle line:84%
I give them just a minute
or two for the body

00:09:38.420 --> 00:09:40.250 align:middle line:90%
to start absorbing new energy--

00:09:40.250 --> 00:09:44.030 align:middle line:84%
and what happens
is they will say,

00:09:44.030 --> 00:09:48.200 align:middle line:84%
oh, well, it's just not as
big of a deal, I feel lighter.

00:09:48.200 --> 00:09:50.720 align:middle line:90%
Or it'll be a new idea.

00:09:50.720 --> 00:09:53.930 align:middle line:84%
It's like, oh, why
didn't I think of that?

00:09:53.930 --> 00:09:55.200 align:middle line:90%
Here's the resolution.

00:09:55.200 --> 00:09:58.520 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So here we
have an active choice

00:09:58.520 --> 00:10:01.550 align:middle line:84%
that we've made that that's
no longer serving us.

00:10:01.550 --> 00:10:03.530 align:middle line:84%
It's come to our
awareness, we're

00:10:03.530 --> 00:10:07.310 align:middle line:84%
physically connecting with it,
and we're actively choosing

00:10:07.310 --> 00:10:09.710 align:middle line:90%
to release that from ourselves.

00:10:09.710 --> 00:10:13.400 align:middle line:84%
And then we're taking action
of a vibrational nature--

00:10:13.400 --> 00:10:15.050 align:middle line:84%
harsh vibrational
nature, really--

00:10:15.050 --> 00:10:16.588 align:middle line:90%
clapping is quite a loud sound--

00:10:16.588 --> 00:10:17.630 align:middle line:90%
and we're dissipating it.

00:10:17.630 --> 00:10:20.088 align:middle line:84%
But it's really the choice
point that we're done with that.

00:10:20.088 --> 00:10:20.888 align:middle line:90%
>>MCKENNA: Yeah.

00:10:20.888 --> 00:10:22.790 align:middle line:84%
You're ready to let
go of it, and you're

00:10:22.790 --> 00:10:24.410 align:middle line:90%
doing something physical, too.

00:10:24.410 --> 00:10:25.760 align:middle line:90%
And there's a vibration.

00:10:25.760 --> 00:10:26.690 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Absolutely.

00:10:26.690 --> 00:10:30.680 align:middle line:84%
OK, so you say that when you
actually connect with it,

00:10:30.680 --> 00:10:33.720 align:middle line:84%
it has kind of a
sponginess about it or so?

00:10:33.720 --> 00:10:34.520 align:middle line:90%
>>MCKENNA: Yeah.

00:10:34.520 --> 00:10:37.103 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Because I'm thinking
if we can have people right now

00:10:37.103 --> 00:10:39.860 align:middle line:84%
just take a moment while
they're watching this just

00:10:39.860 --> 00:10:41.100 align:middle line:90%
take a breath.

00:10:41.100 --> 00:10:43.460 align:middle line:84%
Let's have people take
a breath right now.

00:10:43.460 --> 00:10:47.180 align:middle line:84%
And first, do we want to look at
something you want to manifest,

00:10:47.180 --> 00:10:49.910 align:middle line:84%
or what might be blocking
us by way of fear?

00:10:49.910 --> 00:10:51.090 align:middle line:90%
And then we'll do the other.

00:10:51.090 --> 00:10:54.830 align:middle line:84%
>>MCKENNA: Let's start
with what's blocking you.

00:10:54.830 --> 00:10:57.260 align:middle line:84%
OK, what's blocking
you from manifesting?

00:10:57.260 --> 00:11:00.140 align:middle line:84%
So think of whatever that
biggest thing that you want to

00:11:00.140 --> 00:11:01.940 align:middle line:90%
manifest today.

00:11:01.940 --> 00:11:04.100 align:middle line:90%
That's your big thing.

00:11:04.100 --> 00:11:05.780 align:middle line:90%
And now what you do--

00:11:05.780 --> 00:11:10.250 align:middle line:84%
don't search all over--
just relax and ask yourself,

00:11:10.250 --> 00:11:13.520 align:middle line:84%
if it was somewhere,
where would it be?

00:11:13.520 --> 00:11:14.690 align:middle line:90%
And reach your hand--

00:11:14.690 --> 00:11:15.990 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And then you
start feeling around.

00:11:15.990 --> 00:11:18.290 align:middle line:84%
>>MCKENNA: Well, you reach
your hand out to that place

00:11:18.290 --> 00:11:22.490 align:middle line:84%
where you think it should
be, and keep your mind on it.

00:11:22.490 --> 00:11:25.700 align:middle line:84%
You'll see-- you just feel
right in that neighborhood,

00:11:25.700 --> 00:11:30.290 align:middle line:84%
and you'll feel an air
sponge or a thickness,

00:11:30.290 --> 00:11:33.440 align:middle line:90%
just a thickness there.

00:11:33.440 --> 00:11:35.230 align:middle line:84%
And then as soon
as you do it, you

00:11:35.230 --> 00:11:38.230 align:middle line:84%
can actually put your hand
right in the middle of it.

00:11:38.230 --> 00:11:39.650 align:middle line:90%
It doesn't take much.

00:11:39.650 --> 00:11:40.450 align:middle line:90%
You'll feel it.

00:11:40.450 --> 00:11:42.000 align:middle line:90%
And this is physical.

00:11:42.000 --> 00:11:43.690 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: OK, now
that's interesting

00:11:43.690 --> 00:11:45.400 align:middle line:84%
because I see that
you're reaching out

00:11:45.400 --> 00:11:46.870 align:middle line:90%
with your left hand.

00:11:46.870 --> 00:11:49.840 align:middle line:84%
I'm dyslexic somewhat, so I
get my right and left mixed up.

00:11:49.840 --> 00:11:50.922 align:middle line:90%
That was your left hand.

00:11:50.922 --> 00:11:52.630 align:middle line:84%
Because I'm noticing
this is my left hand

00:11:52.630 --> 00:11:53.980 align:middle line:90%
and you're mirroring me.

00:11:53.980 --> 00:11:56.110 align:middle line:84%
So we're both reaching
out with our left hand.

00:11:56.110 --> 00:11:57.610 align:middle line:84%
Now, this gets to
something we were

00:11:57.610 --> 00:11:59.277 align:middle line:84%
going to talk to you
a little bit later,

00:11:59.277 --> 00:12:01.750 align:middle line:90%
but it makes perfect sense.

00:12:01.750 --> 00:12:06.040 align:middle line:84%
If you look at Eileen
McKusick's work,

00:12:06.040 --> 00:12:09.520 align:middle line:84%
it's the left side of
the body, as I recall--

00:12:09.520 --> 00:12:11.290 align:middle line:90%
I had a session with her--

00:12:11.290 --> 00:12:13.690 align:middle line:84%
it was the left side
of the body that

00:12:13.690 --> 00:12:17.320 align:middle line:84%
was measured with the
tuning forks as the tree

00:12:17.320 --> 00:12:22.300 align:middle line:84%
rings of our experiences and
our trauma and joys in life.

00:12:22.300 --> 00:12:24.550 align:middle line:84%
So it would make
sense that you're--

00:12:24.550 --> 00:12:26.710 align:middle line:84%
it doesn't mean it
has to live there,

00:12:26.710 --> 00:12:30.970 align:middle line:84%
but the way that's broken
down is this is your history,

00:12:30.970 --> 00:12:35.020 align:middle line:84%
and this is how it's actually
affecting the right side, how

00:12:35.020 --> 00:12:39.260 align:middle line:84%
it's showing up and
functioning in your life now.

00:12:39.260 --> 00:12:40.150 align:middle line:90%
>>MCKENNA: OK.

00:12:40.150 --> 00:12:42.220 align:middle line:90%
Well--

00:12:42.220 --> 00:12:44.560 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Then you can tell
whether it's from the past

00:12:44.560 --> 00:12:46.260 align:middle line:84%
or it's dogging
you in the moment.

00:12:46.260 --> 00:12:47.530 align:middle line:90%
I'm just playing with you.

00:12:47.530 --> 00:12:48.330 align:middle line:90%
>>MCKENNA: Yes.

00:12:48.330 --> 00:12:51.340 align:middle line:84%
Well, her research
is just awesome.

00:12:51.340 --> 00:12:53.350 align:middle line:90%
You know I just love her work.

00:12:53.350 --> 00:12:55.090 align:middle line:90%
She's awesome.

00:12:55.090 --> 00:12:56.747 align:middle line:90%
So--

00:12:56.747 --> 00:12:58.580 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: I'm just
saying, as people are now

00:12:58.580 --> 00:13:01.330 align:middle line:84%
searching around, I'm just
tossing that out there.

00:13:01.330 --> 00:13:02.410 align:middle line:90%
>>MCKENNA: Yeah.

00:13:02.410 --> 00:13:05.680 align:middle line:90%
It's a good idea.

00:13:05.680 --> 00:13:09.940 align:middle line:84%
But what I say is,
just let go, and just

00:13:09.940 --> 00:13:12.040 align:middle line:90%
feel whatever comes to you.

00:13:12.040 --> 00:13:14.740 align:middle line:84%
Who knows why it
is, where it is.

00:13:14.740 --> 00:13:17.380 align:middle line:84%
But Eileen's work
is just so awesome

00:13:17.380 --> 00:13:20.650 align:middle line:84%
because she has an awful lot
of research over many decades.

00:13:20.650 --> 00:13:23.080 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Yeah, and I just
noticed both of our left hands

00:13:23.080 --> 00:13:24.610 align:middle line:84%
went out, and I
thought, oh-- it's

00:13:24.610 --> 00:13:26.440 align:middle line:84%
like it's naturally
searching for something

00:13:26.440 --> 00:13:28.810 align:middle line:90%
that is in our history.

00:13:28.810 --> 00:13:29.800 align:middle line:90%
>>MCKENNA: Yes.

00:13:29.800 --> 00:13:33.150 align:middle line:84%
And one of the things I love
about her work is that--

00:13:33.150 --> 00:13:36.620 align:middle line:84%
and this is something that she
actually participated in this,

00:13:36.620 --> 00:13:39.670 align:middle line:84%
she helped out-- which
is, if it's in the field,

00:13:39.670 --> 00:13:41.200 align:middle line:90%
it's from the past or future.

00:13:41.200 --> 00:13:42.230 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah, exactly.

00:13:42.230 --> 00:13:46.010 align:middle line:84%
>>MCKENNA: And if it's
in the chakras, it's now.

00:13:46.010 --> 00:13:52.210 align:middle line:84%
So anyway, this helps
everybody to know,

00:13:52.210 --> 00:13:56.050 align:middle line:84%
it's also where
if we are wanting

00:13:56.050 --> 00:13:58.420 align:middle line:84%
something, that means
it's outside of us,

00:13:58.420 --> 00:14:00.670 align:middle line:84%
and our subconscious,
we're looking

00:14:00.670 --> 00:14:02.890 align:middle line:90%
to that particular location.

00:14:02.890 --> 00:14:05.710 align:middle line:84%
When me move this
out of the field

00:14:05.710 --> 00:14:09.730 align:middle line:84%
and through this downgrading
process into the physical,

00:14:09.730 --> 00:14:14.620 align:middle line:84%
you actually feel different,
and you can't locate it anymore

00:14:14.620 --> 00:14:16.360 align:middle line:90%
out there mentally.

00:14:16.360 --> 00:14:18.640 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: That's
really interesting.

00:14:18.640 --> 00:14:21.220 align:middle line:84%
And you know me, I've got to
kind of dig down and find out

00:14:21.220 --> 00:14:22.180 align:middle line:90%
the mechanics of--

00:14:22.180 --> 00:14:25.870 align:middle line:84%
I like knowing the mechanics
of magic, personally.

00:14:25.870 --> 00:14:27.290 align:middle line:90%
So that makes sense.

00:14:27.290 --> 00:14:30.760 align:middle line:84%
So I can't really do that
live right now with you

00:14:30.760 --> 00:14:32.260 align:middle line:90%
because I'm sitting in a chair.

00:14:32.260 --> 00:14:33.460 align:middle line:90%
If I were at home--

00:14:33.460 --> 00:14:36.015 align:middle line:84%
I'm hoping people are
already doing this--

00:14:36.015 --> 00:14:38.140 align:middle line:84%
you want to stand up
somewhere where you can really

00:14:38.140 --> 00:14:39.515 align:middle line:84%
kind of feel around
in your aura,

00:14:39.515 --> 00:14:41.290 align:middle line:84%
your hands are
free to roam a bit,

00:14:41.290 --> 00:14:43.000 align:middle line:90%
and you're in a quiet space.

00:14:43.000 --> 00:14:45.940 align:middle line:84%
OK, so hopefully people
have now manifested

00:14:45.940 --> 00:14:48.580 align:middle line:84%
and they've now been able to
touch with-- not manifestation,

00:14:48.580 --> 00:14:50.920 align:middle line:84%
but the thing that's dogging
them and blocking them.

00:14:50.920 --> 00:14:52.000 align:middle line:90%
>>MCKENNA: Correct.

00:14:52.000 --> 00:14:54.770 align:middle line:84%
So they find the thing
that's dogging them.

00:14:54.770 --> 00:14:55.630 align:middle line:90%
Feel under it.

00:14:55.630 --> 00:14:57.130 align:middle line:84%
You'll feel a little
bit of weight.

00:14:57.130 --> 00:15:01.600 align:middle line:84%
It may feel hot, may feel cold,
but you'll feel a resistance.

00:15:01.600 --> 00:15:04.690 align:middle line:84%
And then what you do is,
just like a flamenco dancer--

00:15:04.690 --> 00:15:06.260 align:middle line:90%
da da da da da da da--

00:15:06.260 --> 00:15:07.060 align:middle line:90%
right through.

00:15:07.060 --> 00:15:12.790 align:middle line:84%
And it only takes maybe 20--
da, da-- maybe 20 seconds.

00:15:12.790 --> 00:15:14.050 align:middle line:90%
20 seconds would be a lot.

00:15:14.050 --> 00:15:16.420 align:middle line:90%
Maybe 10 seconds.

00:15:16.420 --> 00:15:19.870 align:middle line:84%
And then what you do, then
just put your hand back out,

00:15:19.870 --> 00:15:20.860 align:middle line:90%
and you'll see it.

00:15:20.860 --> 00:15:21.818 align:middle line:90%
It's going to be like--

00:15:21.818 --> 00:15:23.652 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Moving right
through where it was.

00:15:23.652 --> 00:15:26.150 align:middle line:84%
>>MCKENNA: Yeah, and there's
no resistance there anymore.

00:15:26.150 --> 00:15:30.070 align:middle line:84%
And then notice, do
I feel any different

00:15:30.070 --> 00:15:32.738 align:middle line:90%
or do I have a new idea?

00:15:32.738 --> 00:15:34.530 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: OK, I'm hoping
that everybody did

00:15:34.530 --> 00:15:35.520 align:middle line:90%
that while we were chatting.

00:15:35.520 --> 00:15:37.380 align:middle line:84%
There was plenty of
time to do it in there.

00:15:37.380 --> 00:15:39.510 align:middle line:84%
Now let's do the same
thing with manifestation.

00:15:39.510 --> 00:15:42.360 align:middle line:84%
So we want to just give
everyone pause for a moment

00:15:42.360 --> 00:15:46.170 align:middle line:84%
to think of what is the thing
I really want to manifest.

00:15:46.170 --> 00:15:48.120 align:middle line:90%
>>MCKENNA: Ooh, yes.

00:15:48.120 --> 00:15:50.860 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: I really-- so the
desire is already in you,

00:15:50.860 --> 00:15:53.710 align:middle line:90%
so it's already part of you.

00:15:53.710 --> 00:15:55.590 align:middle line:84%
And then to reach
out and feel that.

00:15:55.590 --> 00:15:58.890 align:middle line:84%
Now that might be the other hand
because that is in the future.

00:15:58.890 --> 00:15:59.690 align:middle line:90%
>>MCKENNA: Feel it.

00:15:59.690 --> 00:16:02.040 align:middle line:90%
Find-- where would it be?

00:16:02.040 --> 00:16:04.380 align:middle line:84%
Where would it be
if it was somewhere?

00:16:04.380 --> 00:16:07.410 align:middle line:84%
OK, that's going to be
the first place you look.

00:16:07.410 --> 00:16:10.523 align:middle line:84%
If you do it that way,
you'll go right to it.

00:16:10.523 --> 00:16:11.940 align:middle line:84%
And you just kind
of, like, hmm, I

00:16:11.940 --> 00:16:13.590 align:middle line:90%
think it would be around here.

00:16:13.590 --> 00:16:16.482 align:middle line:84%
If you happen to be a person
that talks with your hands--

00:16:16.482 --> 00:16:18.690 align:middle line:84%
if you just say, I'm going
to talk about the new car,

00:16:18.690 --> 00:16:21.870 align:middle line:84%
and that new car is da,
da, da, and that new car--

00:16:21.870 --> 00:16:23.580 align:middle line:90%
it's there.

00:16:23.580 --> 00:16:25.960 align:middle line:90%
So you reach out and feel it.

00:16:25.960 --> 00:16:28.200 align:middle line:90%
And when you do, you'll feel--

00:16:28.200 --> 00:16:30.990 align:middle line:84%
not only will you feel
it, the weight of it,

00:16:30.990 --> 00:16:35.550 align:middle line:84%
the sides, the top,
how big it is--

00:16:35.550 --> 00:16:37.970 align:middle line:84%
put your hand
right in the middle

00:16:37.970 --> 00:16:40.743 align:middle line:84%
and notice how
your body responds.

00:16:40.743 --> 00:16:41.910 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: This is different.

00:16:41.910 --> 00:16:43.330 align:middle line:84%
You don't want to
clap that away.

00:16:43.330 --> 00:16:45.180 align:middle line:90%
No, no, no.

00:16:45.180 --> 00:16:48.530 align:middle line:84%
You want to embrace it,
you want to acknowledge it,

00:16:48.530 --> 00:16:51.080 align:middle line:84%
you want to thank it for
showing itself to you

00:16:51.080 --> 00:16:53.150 align:middle line:90%
so you know it's in process.

00:16:53.150 --> 00:16:55.440 align:middle line:90%
>>MCKENNA: Yes.

00:16:55.440 --> 00:17:00.400 align:middle line:84%
So when you actually
put your hand in it,

00:17:00.400 --> 00:17:03.000 align:middle line:84%
some people will kind
of see a timeline.

00:17:03.000 --> 00:17:05.970 align:middle line:84%
Like, oh, what happens five
minutes, 10 minutes later,

00:17:05.970 --> 00:17:07.109 align:middle line:90%
a year later?

00:17:07.109 --> 00:17:09.000 align:middle line:90%
What is this like?

00:17:09.000 --> 00:17:12.329 align:middle line:84%
Occasionally, people
will be like, uh-oh,

00:17:12.329 --> 00:17:15.400 align:middle line:84%
that's actually not
what I really want.

00:17:15.400 --> 00:17:16.650 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Once you step in it.

00:17:16.650 --> 00:17:18.119 align:middle line:84%
>>MCKENNA: Yeah, they
clap-- yeah, the step in it,

00:17:18.119 --> 00:17:20.161 align:middle line:84%
clap it out, and they'll
say, well, what I really

00:17:20.161 --> 00:17:21.610 align:middle line:90%
want is this over here.

00:17:21.610 --> 00:17:22.410 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:17:22.410 --> 00:17:25.079 align:middle line:84%
OK, let's talk about
something really important

00:17:25.079 --> 00:17:26.260 align:middle line:90%
right now here.

00:17:26.260 --> 00:17:29.040 align:middle line:84%
This is a big topic that
people don't get to.

00:17:29.040 --> 00:17:31.980 align:middle line:90%
And a lot of people, I think--

00:17:31.980 --> 00:17:33.930 align:middle line:84%
this is across the
board, whether you're

00:17:33.930 --> 00:17:36.670 align:middle line:84%
in a spiritual community
or business community

00:17:36.670 --> 00:17:37.600 align:middle line:90%
or whether you're in--

00:17:37.600 --> 00:17:38.850 align:middle line:90%
doesn't matter what you're in.

00:17:38.850 --> 00:17:39.780 align:middle line:90%
It's a human thing.

00:17:39.780 --> 00:17:41.370 align:middle line:90%
Instrumentalism.

00:17:41.370 --> 00:17:44.940 align:middle line:84%
Like you just said, no,
that's not what I really want,

00:17:44.940 --> 00:17:48.520 align:middle line:84%
I wanted that so I
could get over there.

00:17:48.520 --> 00:17:51.630 align:middle line:84%
So now let's break that down
a bit because instrumental

00:17:51.630 --> 00:17:53.730 align:middle line:84%
thinking is the
least direct path,

00:17:53.730 --> 00:17:57.780 align:middle line:84%
but we always feel we have to
somehow earn something or do

00:17:57.780 --> 00:17:59.310 align:middle line:90%
something to get something.

00:17:59.310 --> 00:18:00.303 align:middle line:90%
Let's talk about that.

00:18:00.303 --> 00:18:01.470 align:middle line:90%
Because that's a block, too.

00:18:01.470 --> 00:18:03.280 align:middle line:90%
>>MCKENNA: It is.

00:18:03.280 --> 00:18:06.750 align:middle line:84%
So this was something
that was super important

00:18:06.750 --> 00:18:07.950 align:middle line:90%
about the process--

00:18:07.950 --> 00:18:09.330 align:middle line:90%
why.

00:18:09.330 --> 00:18:10.870 align:middle line:90%
Why do I want it?

00:18:10.870 --> 00:18:12.570 align:middle line:90%
OK, that.

00:18:12.570 --> 00:18:13.710 align:middle line:90%
All right.

00:18:13.710 --> 00:18:16.110 align:middle line:90%
And why is that important to me?

00:18:16.110 --> 00:18:19.680 align:middle line:84%
So you just keep asking why,
and why is that important to me.

00:18:19.680 --> 00:18:22.450 align:middle line:84%
So you keep on-- dink, dink,
dink-- and you'll get to it.

00:18:22.450 --> 00:18:25.020 align:middle line:84%
And it's like, oh,
OK, well, maybe

00:18:25.020 --> 00:18:27.840 align:middle line:84%
this is what I really
want, it's not really that,

00:18:27.840 --> 00:18:29.667 align:middle line:90%
as you're saying.

00:18:29.667 --> 00:18:31.500 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: You want maybe
the thing that that

00:18:31.500 --> 00:18:32.880 align:middle line:84%
would ultimately
lead to, but you

00:18:32.880 --> 00:18:35.280 align:middle line:84%
think you can't go there
directly you for some reason.

00:18:35.280 --> 00:18:36.870 align:middle line:90%
>>MCKENNA: Yeah, exactly.

00:18:36.870 --> 00:18:38.790 align:middle line:84%
If I become a
billionaire, people

00:18:38.790 --> 00:18:41.260 align:middle line:84%
are going to love me because
I'm going to give them money,

00:18:41.260 --> 00:18:42.870 align:middle line:90%
or something.

00:18:42.870 --> 00:18:45.780 align:middle line:84%
Then people are
going to respect me.

00:18:45.780 --> 00:18:48.220 align:middle line:84%
Where maybe if you
treat people different,

00:18:48.220 --> 00:18:49.500 align:middle line:90%
they might just respect you.

00:18:49.500 --> 00:18:50.400 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Exactly.

00:18:50.400 --> 00:18:53.460 align:middle line:84%
So that's part of the
process, part of the protocol,

00:18:53.460 --> 00:19:00.390 align:middle line:84%
is just keep inquiring
what you want from that.

00:19:00.390 --> 00:19:01.230 align:middle line:90%
>>MCKENNA: Yeah.

00:19:01.230 --> 00:19:05.430 align:middle line:84%
And this, by the way,
is the scope of life.

00:19:05.430 --> 00:19:10.480 align:middle line:84%
Anything that you could
imagine, this applies to.

00:19:10.480 --> 00:19:12.520 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Now, if you're
asking for something

00:19:12.520 --> 00:19:16.970 align:middle line:84%
that is not in alignment,
maybe, with your higher part,

00:19:16.970 --> 00:19:20.870 align:middle line:84%
but it's just
something you desire,

00:19:20.870 --> 00:19:26.050 align:middle line:84%
how does that information
get reflected back to you?

00:19:26.050 --> 00:19:28.060 align:middle line:84%
>>MCKENNA: That's
a good question.

00:19:28.060 --> 00:19:29.990 align:middle line:84%
It often will get
reflected back as--

00:19:29.990 --> 00:19:30.790 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: No.

00:19:30.790 --> 00:19:33.730 align:middle line:84%
>>MCKENNA: Yeah,
no, or resistance.

00:19:33.730 --> 00:19:37.540 align:middle line:84%
You're trying like
hell and it ain't

00:19:37.540 --> 00:19:43.700 align:middle line:84%
going to happen because
it's not good for you.

00:19:43.700 --> 00:19:48.700 align:middle line:84%
So one of the questions you
want to ask yourself is,

00:19:48.700 --> 00:19:52.010 align:middle line:90%
is this good for all?

00:19:52.010 --> 00:19:54.260 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes, for all.

00:19:54.260 --> 00:19:56.935 align:middle line:84%
OK, so I think it's
really important--

00:19:56.935 --> 00:19:58.310 align:middle line:84%
this is an important
conversation

00:19:58.310 --> 00:19:59.600 align:middle line:90%
to have real clarity on.

00:19:59.600 --> 00:20:01.280 align:middle line:84%
Because if you say,
I really want this,

00:20:01.280 --> 00:20:03.080 align:middle line:84%
and you're just
getting resistance

00:20:03.080 --> 00:20:06.640 align:middle line:84%
and just feels kind of icky,
then you got to look at-- you

00:20:06.640 --> 00:20:08.390 align:middle line:84%
got to start asking
those other questions.

00:20:08.390 --> 00:20:09.980 align:middle line:84%
And it sounds like that's
exactly what you're

00:20:09.980 --> 00:20:10.800 align:middle line:90%
talking about.

00:20:10.800 --> 00:20:13.640 align:middle line:84%
>>MCKENNA: Yeah, and this
will change a lot of times.

00:20:13.640 --> 00:20:17.180 align:middle line:84%
When people finally
go through the process

00:20:17.180 --> 00:20:19.850 align:middle line:84%
and they've eliminated the
resistance, a lot of times,

00:20:19.850 --> 00:20:22.993 align:middle line:84%
they're like, nah, not
really what I wanted.

00:20:22.993 --> 00:20:24.410 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And it's
like right now.

00:20:24.410 --> 00:20:26.240 align:middle line:84%
So many people are
edgy and nervous

00:20:26.240 --> 00:20:28.040 align:middle line:84%
and they felt cooped
up for so long,

00:20:28.040 --> 00:20:30.800 align:middle line:84%
and they have a lot of
desires and frustrations.

00:20:30.800 --> 00:20:32.880 align:middle line:84%
It could be
something like, well,

00:20:32.880 --> 00:20:34.400 align:middle line:90%
I just want to move to Canada.

00:20:34.400 --> 00:20:37.250 align:middle line:90%
That's one you would hear.

00:20:37.250 --> 00:20:40.370 align:middle line:84%
"I've got to move to
Canada," which has--

00:20:40.370 --> 00:20:43.040 align:middle line:84%
you have to jump through
a few hoops to do that.

00:20:43.040 --> 00:20:45.470 align:middle line:84%
They don't just say, yeah,
come on in because you're

00:20:45.470 --> 00:20:47.090 align:middle line:90%
a dissatisfied American.

00:20:47.090 --> 00:20:48.500 align:middle line:84%
But in fact, what
you want is you

00:20:48.500 --> 00:20:51.858 align:middle line:84%
want to feel comfortable
in your own skin again.

00:20:51.858 --> 00:20:53.400 align:middle line:84%
You want to feel
part of a community.

00:20:53.400 --> 00:20:55.430 align:middle line:84%
It doesn't mean you have
to move away, per se.

00:20:55.430 --> 00:20:58.070 align:middle line:84%
That's just one kind of
little example of where we'll

00:20:58.070 --> 00:21:00.170 align:middle line:84%
kind of get an idea or
construct in our head,

00:21:00.170 --> 00:21:03.470 align:middle line:84%
but it's actually the feeling
that we want to satisfy.

00:21:03.470 --> 00:21:06.030 align:middle line:84%
>>MCKENNA: Yes,
that's exactly it.

00:21:06.030 --> 00:21:06.830 align:middle line:90%
Exactly it.

00:21:06.830 --> 00:21:09.080 align:middle line:84%
And it is the feeling
which will get us it.

00:21:09.080 --> 00:21:10.010 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:21:10.010 --> 00:21:12.050 align:middle line:90%
So OK, you got to feel it.

00:21:12.050 --> 00:21:13.610 align:middle line:84%
You got to be feeling
it, and it has

00:21:13.610 --> 00:21:17.083 align:middle line:84%
to feel inviting and warm
and expansive and loving or

00:21:17.083 --> 00:21:19.250 align:middle line:84%
whatever, this thing that
you're trying to manifest.

00:21:19.250 --> 00:21:21.208 align:middle line:84%
Then you know you're on
the right track, right?

00:21:21.208 --> 00:21:25.472 align:middle line:84%
>>MCKENNA: Yes, but this
is really difficult.

00:21:25.472 --> 00:21:26.930 align:middle line:84%
I don't know if
this is a good time

00:21:26.930 --> 00:21:30.140 align:middle line:84%
to talk about that
and the base chakra.

00:21:30.140 --> 00:21:31.070 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Absolutely.

00:21:31.070 --> 00:21:32.990 align:middle line:90%
>>MCKENNA: OK.

00:21:32.990 --> 00:21:35.595 align:middle line:90%
So law of attraction.

00:21:35.595 --> 00:21:37.970 align:middle line:84%
Everybody is trying to-- like,
oh, you've got to feel it,

00:21:37.970 --> 00:21:39.110 align:middle line:84%
you've got to feel
the love, you got

00:21:39.110 --> 00:21:41.030 align:middle line:84%
to feel the good
feeling of having it.

00:21:41.030 --> 00:21:42.270 align:middle line:90%
That sort of thing.

00:21:42.270 --> 00:21:48.170 align:middle line:84%
Well, with being
in our human nature

00:21:48.170 --> 00:21:56.210 align:middle line:84%
is that if we don't have
it, we don't feel stable.

00:21:56.210 --> 00:21:59.190 align:middle line:84%
Our first chakra is
all about stability.

00:21:59.190 --> 00:22:01.100 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So it's mixing
fear in with desire.

00:22:01.100 --> 00:22:03.260 align:middle line:84%
>>MCKENNA: Yeah,
fear and desire.

00:22:03.260 --> 00:22:08.900 align:middle line:84%
And so when our base chakra is
not stable, then what happens

00:22:08.900 --> 00:22:11.630 align:middle line:84%
is our entire system--
if you looked at it kind

00:22:11.630 --> 00:22:14.960 align:middle line:84%
of like a foundation
of a building--

00:22:14.960 --> 00:22:20.120 align:middle line:84%
if the base chakra is
not stable, then so,

00:22:20.120 --> 00:22:22.670 align:middle line:84%
too, everything
else is off balance.

00:22:22.670 --> 00:22:25.790 align:middle line:84%
If I don't feel
financially stable

00:22:25.790 --> 00:22:29.993 align:middle line:84%
and I don't feel physically
able, if I feel--

00:22:29.993 --> 00:22:31.160 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Don't feel worthy.

00:22:31.160 --> 00:22:32.780 align:middle line:84%
>>MCKENNA: If I
don't feel worthy,

00:22:32.780 --> 00:22:35.330 align:middle line:84%
if I'm in a war torn
country and I'm-- like,

00:22:35.330 --> 00:22:37.400 align:middle line:90%
threats of violence and stuff--

00:22:37.400 --> 00:22:41.180 align:middle line:84%
then I don't feel
like I can enjoy

00:22:41.180 --> 00:22:42.870 align:middle line:90%
the physical pleasures of life.

00:22:42.870 --> 00:22:44.030 align:middle line:90%
The second chakra.

00:22:44.030 --> 00:22:47.060 align:middle line:10%
I don't feel I have my
power, the third chakra.

00:22:47.060 --> 00:22:49.460 align:middle line:10%
I certainly don't
feel like I can just

00:22:49.460 --> 00:22:52.130 align:middle line:10%
reach out and love everybody.

00:22:52.130 --> 00:22:54.230 align:middle line:84%
Speaking my truth might
get me in trouble,

00:22:54.230 --> 00:22:57.680 align:middle line:84%
I doubt my intuition,
and where's God?

00:22:57.680 --> 00:22:59.670 align:middle line:84%
Where's my support
from the universe?

00:22:59.670 --> 00:23:02.390 align:middle line:90%
So everything goes all cockeyed.

00:23:02.390 --> 00:23:06.920 align:middle line:84%
So what we're going
to learn today

00:23:06.920 --> 00:23:10.280 align:middle line:84%
is how to snatch
this out of the field

00:23:10.280 --> 00:23:15.320 align:middle line:84%
and pull it in and pull it
down to our base chakra.

00:23:15.320 --> 00:23:20.240 align:middle line:84%
And when we do this, the
most wonderful thing happens,

00:23:20.240 --> 00:23:25.130 align:middle line:84%
and that is that we
have a stable feeling.

00:23:25.130 --> 00:23:30.850 align:middle line:84%
We are no longer
trying to get it,

00:23:30.850 --> 00:23:34.330 align:middle line:84%
but we'll have a
feeling of, I have it.

00:23:34.330 --> 00:23:40.220 align:middle line:84%
And with this, it's
so easy to let go.

00:23:40.220 --> 00:23:43.100 align:middle line:84%
We're no longer trying to
manufacture the feeling.

00:23:43.100 --> 00:23:44.450 align:middle line:90%
It's just the way we feel.

00:23:44.450 --> 00:23:46.260 align:middle line:84%
It's like, no,
this is happening.

00:23:46.260 --> 00:23:47.060 align:middle line:90%
This is going down.

00:23:47.060 --> 00:23:48.477 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Well,
let's get into it.

00:23:48.477 --> 00:23:49.970 align:middle line:90%
>>MCKENNA: OK, all right.

00:23:49.970 --> 00:23:51.702 align:middle line:90%
We're going to demo it?

00:23:51.702 --> 00:23:52.910 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Well, I don't know.

00:23:52.910 --> 00:23:53.990 align:middle line:84%
What are we going
to do, how are you

00:23:53.990 --> 00:23:55.720 align:middle line:84%
going to let people
know how this works?

00:23:55.720 --> 00:23:56.803 align:middle line:90%
I don't know, you tell me.

00:23:56.803 --> 00:23:58.710 align:middle line:90%
>>MCKENNA: OK, I'm good to go.

00:23:58.710 --> 00:24:01.167 align:middle line:84%
I'm going to-- I will
show you right now how--

00:24:01.167 --> 00:24:03.500 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: As long as you can
do it sitting in your chair

00:24:03.500 --> 00:24:04.670 align:middle line:90%
so the camera can see you.

00:24:04.670 --> 00:24:05.060 align:middle line:90%
>>MCKENNA: Yes.

00:24:05.060 --> 00:24:05.860 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: OK, good.

00:24:05.860 --> 00:24:09.140 align:middle line:84%
>>MCKENNA: OK, well, actually
I should probably preface this.

00:24:09.140 --> 00:24:14.690 align:middle line:84%
Let's talk about the
magnetoencephalograph.

00:24:14.690 --> 00:24:22.800 align:middle line:84%
OK, so things that
are out in the field,

00:24:22.800 --> 00:24:24.510 align:middle line:90%
we can actually measure now.

00:24:24.510 --> 00:24:26.800 align:middle line:84%
You have your brain,
and now there--

00:24:26.800 --> 00:24:29.310 align:middle line:90%
and we've done EEGs in the past.

00:24:29.310 --> 00:24:32.010 align:middle line:84%
You wear a hat, and they
measure all your brainwaves

00:24:32.010 --> 00:24:34.680 align:middle line:84%
and everything, and
you scan your brain.

00:24:34.680 --> 00:24:38.850 align:middle line:84%
Well, now this device,
this magnetoencephalograph,

00:24:38.850 --> 00:24:43.480 align:middle line:84%
what it does is it has
sensors outside of your head,

00:24:43.480 --> 00:24:45.360 align:middle line:90%
and when we have the thought--

00:24:45.360 --> 00:24:49.980 align:middle line:84%
pop-- it generates a
electromagnetic spark out

00:24:49.980 --> 00:24:54.480 align:middle line:84%
here that is actually picked
up outside of your brain.

00:24:54.480 --> 00:24:58.110 align:middle line:84%
And there's a location of
this thought in your brain

00:24:58.110 --> 00:25:00.825 align:middle line:84%
that they can tell
from out in the field.

00:25:00.825 --> 00:25:02.700 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: They know
where it originated from?

00:25:02.700 --> 00:25:06.420 align:middle line:84%
Well, they know where the
processing unit was located--

00:25:06.420 --> 00:25:08.880 align:middle line:84%
where in the processing
unit that was located,

00:25:08.880 --> 00:25:09.880 align:middle line:90%
that particular spark?

00:25:09.880 --> 00:25:10.680 align:middle line:90%
>>MCKENNA: Yeah.

00:25:10.680 --> 00:25:11.597 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Interesting.

00:25:11.597 --> 00:25:14.430 align:middle line:90%
>>MCKENNA: So here you are.

00:25:14.430 --> 00:25:19.230 align:middle line:84%
You've got, now,
evidence of the mind,

00:25:19.230 --> 00:25:21.690 align:middle line:90%
the subconscious, the field.

00:25:21.690 --> 00:25:24.930 align:middle line:84%
Your thoughts are not here,
they're actually in the field.

00:25:24.930 --> 00:25:28.200 align:middle line:84%
And this further validates,
oh, I can feel it.

00:25:28.200 --> 00:25:29.040 align:middle line:90%
Well, guess what?

00:25:29.040 --> 00:25:30.660 align:middle line:90%
It's real.

00:25:30.660 --> 00:25:38.740 align:middle line:84%
So there is-- if I think
of, let's say, a cowboy.

00:25:38.740 --> 00:25:41.310 align:middle line:90%
I want a cowboy--

00:25:41.310 --> 00:25:43.840 align:middle line:84%
I'm a girl, I want
a cowboy boyfriend--

00:25:43.840 --> 00:25:46.990 align:middle line:84%
can be a boy, too-- but
say I want a cowboy.

00:25:46.990 --> 00:25:48.880 align:middle line:84%
Well, if I really
think about a cowboy,

00:25:48.880 --> 00:25:51.080 align:middle line:84%
that's going to light
up part of my brain.

00:25:51.080 --> 00:25:53.540 align:middle line:84%
I think, oh, yeah,
that's what I want.

00:25:53.540 --> 00:25:57.820 align:middle line:84%
OK, well, you just felt it
with your hand in the field.

00:25:57.820 --> 00:26:01.210 align:middle line:84%
Now, from the work that
we did with cognomovement,

00:26:01.210 --> 00:26:06.220 align:middle line:84%
we figured out that
wherever your eyes are--

00:26:06.220 --> 00:26:08.380 align:middle line:84%
if you look around
with your eyes,

00:26:08.380 --> 00:26:12.160 align:middle line:84%
there is a particular part of
the brain that will light up

00:26:12.160 --> 00:26:14.440 align:middle line:90%
in a particular location.

00:26:14.440 --> 00:26:18.280 align:middle line:84%
A memory or a
thought or a desire.

00:26:18.280 --> 00:26:23.620 align:middle line:84%
So when we-- let's say
this is right here--

00:26:23.620 --> 00:26:28.750 align:middle line:84%
the thing that I wanted to
manifest is right here--

00:26:28.750 --> 00:26:33.303 align:middle line:84%
if I pin my eyes on it and
I rotate my eyes around

00:26:33.303 --> 00:26:34.970 align:middle line:84%
and I keep on rotating
them around very,

00:26:34.970 --> 00:26:39.340 align:middle line:84%
very slowly, there's going to
be a connection point where

00:26:39.340 --> 00:26:45.460 align:middle line:84%
my brain is connected, lit up,
with this part of the field.

00:26:45.460 --> 00:26:48.490 align:middle line:84%
And when this
happens, it's amazing.

00:26:48.490 --> 00:26:53.680 align:middle line:84%
It's like-- wah-wah-wah--
you literally will feel this.

00:26:53.680 --> 00:26:56.610 align:middle line:84%
You're here and you're like,
uh-oh, whoa, what's going on?

00:26:56.610 --> 00:27:00.240 align:middle line:84%
You feel this what I
call a quantum wobble.

00:27:00.240 --> 00:27:03.480 align:middle line:84%
And you feel like, oh, my
gosh, it's interdimensional.

00:27:03.480 --> 00:27:05.950 align:middle line:90%
I'm like, this is very strange.

00:27:05.950 --> 00:27:08.610 align:middle line:84%
It'll be strange for
anybody because it's

00:27:08.610 --> 00:27:10.050 align:middle line:90%
a whole new feeling.

00:27:10.050 --> 00:27:12.060 align:middle line:90%
But it's easy to find.

00:27:12.060 --> 00:27:16.320 align:middle line:84%
You just simply
rotate, and now, when

00:27:16.320 --> 00:27:20.040 align:middle line:84%
my brain is connected
very specifically

00:27:20.040 --> 00:27:22.620 align:middle line:84%
with this item in the
field, you get this wobble.

00:27:22.620 --> 00:27:25.080 align:middle line:84%
And you also have this
feeling in your body

00:27:25.080 --> 00:27:28.890 align:middle line:84%
like, oh, this is going
to be good, I like this.

00:27:28.890 --> 00:27:30.640 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So let me
just get clarity here.

00:27:30.640 --> 00:27:32.130 align:middle line:84%
So when you're
looking at the place

00:27:32.130 --> 00:27:35.160 align:middle line:84%
you've found this
in the aura, then

00:27:35.160 --> 00:27:38.980 align:middle line:84%
you want to have the full
range of eye movement.

00:27:38.980 --> 00:27:41.800 align:middle line:84%
So you want to move your head
like this so your eyes stay

00:27:41.800 --> 00:27:42.600 align:middle line:90%
trained on it?

00:27:42.600 --> 00:27:43.270 align:middle line:90%
>>MCKENNA: Yes.

00:27:43.270 --> 00:27:44.100 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: OK.

00:27:44.100 --> 00:27:46.560 align:middle line:84%
And then that is
going to precipitate

00:27:46.560 --> 00:27:49.300 align:middle line:84%
the feeling in the part of
the brain that's involved?

00:27:49.300 --> 00:27:51.150 align:middle line:84%
>>MCKENNA: Yeah,
you're searching.

00:27:51.150 --> 00:27:54.180 align:middle line:84%
Let's say it's right here,
and you're searching it out.

00:27:54.180 --> 00:27:56.730 align:middle line:84%
Very, very slowly,
you pin it on it.

00:27:56.730 --> 00:28:00.600 align:middle line:84%
Now, what we do is--
you can use anything.

00:28:00.600 --> 00:28:03.900 align:middle line:84%
Because it's a little bit easier
to take a device, something--

00:28:03.900 --> 00:28:05.670 align:middle line:90%
put your cup there--

00:28:05.670 --> 00:28:07.740 align:middle line:84%
where the car is,
or the cowboy--

00:28:07.740 --> 00:28:08.940 align:middle line:90%
let's say it's the cowboy--

00:28:08.940 --> 00:28:09.740 align:middle line:90%
right here.

00:28:09.740 --> 00:28:14.040 align:middle line:84%
And now I'm looking at it, and
I'm looking for the sweet spot.

00:28:14.040 --> 00:28:16.967 align:middle line:84%
And usually you'll--
you do it very slowly.

00:28:16.967 --> 00:28:19.050 align:middle line:84%
All of a sudden, you'll
feel it-- whoa-whoa-whoa--

00:28:19.050 --> 00:28:20.550 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And that's when
you feel part of the brain

00:28:20.550 --> 00:28:21.350 align:middle line:90%
activate.

00:28:21.350 --> 00:28:23.740 align:middle line:84%
>>MCKENNA: The brain is
activated, and the body, too.

00:28:23.740 --> 00:28:24.907 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Interesting, yeah.

00:28:24.907 --> 00:28:27.330 align:middle line:90%
>>MCKENNA: It's really neat.

00:28:27.330 --> 00:28:29.620 align:middle line:90%
So how do we do this?

00:28:29.620 --> 00:28:32.790 align:middle line:84%
I wanted to get through
that portion of it first,

00:28:32.790 --> 00:28:35.650 align:middle line:90%
just so people understand that.

00:28:35.650 --> 00:28:39.820 align:middle line:84%
Everybody has already
located that in the field.

00:28:39.820 --> 00:28:41.380 align:middle line:90%
So you reach out--

00:28:41.380 --> 00:28:44.830 align:middle line:84%
you reach out, and you say,
OK, well, there's that cowboy,

00:28:44.830 --> 00:28:46.900 align:middle line:90%
he's got that belt buckle.

00:28:46.900 --> 00:28:47.710 align:middle line:90%
Look at that.

00:28:47.710 --> 00:28:51.970 align:middle line:84%
You feel it all around,
feeling the spongy thing.

00:28:51.970 --> 00:28:55.720 align:middle line:84%
And then you may take that
device and you put it up there,

00:28:55.720 --> 00:28:58.690 align:middle line:84%
and just pin your
eye right on it.

00:28:58.690 --> 00:29:01.510 align:middle line:84%
And just slowly--
like this slowly--

00:29:01.510 --> 00:29:04.900 align:middle line:90%
just move the entire distance.

00:29:04.900 --> 00:29:10.540 align:middle line:84%
And at some point, you're going
to start having a reaction.

00:29:10.540 --> 00:29:17.220 align:middle line:84%
Now, when you do
this, you simply

00:29:17.220 --> 00:29:20.140 align:middle line:84%
just allow that
feeling to build.

00:29:20.140 --> 00:29:23.010 align:middle line:84%
If you can't find
it, no big deal.

00:29:23.010 --> 00:29:27.090 align:middle line:84%
You still located
it in the field.

00:29:27.090 --> 00:29:29.130 align:middle line:90%
This is an add-on.

00:29:29.130 --> 00:29:30.510 align:middle line:90%
It's still going to work.

00:29:30.510 --> 00:29:31.350 align:middle line:90%
Don't worry.

00:29:31.350 --> 00:29:33.780 align:middle line:84%
Don't get hung up on,
I couldn't find it--

00:29:33.780 --> 00:29:35.190 align:middle line:90%
no, it's OK.

00:29:35.190 --> 00:29:37.830 align:middle line:84%
So you just-- here
it is in the field.

00:29:37.830 --> 00:29:40.030 align:middle line:90%
You keep your eye pinned on it.

00:29:40.030 --> 00:29:44.220 align:middle line:84%
And notice the part of your
body that is reacting--

00:29:44.220 --> 00:29:46.650 align:middle line:84%
it's in my heart,
I can feel it--

00:29:46.650 --> 00:29:51.095 align:middle line:84%
OK, just take it slowly,
pinning your eye,

00:29:51.095 --> 00:29:52.470 align:middle line:84%
and with all your
intentions, I'm

00:29:52.470 --> 00:29:56.100 align:middle line:84%
taking this right
out of the field,

00:29:56.100 --> 00:30:01.090 align:middle line:84%
and I'm going to pull it
right into my physical body.

00:30:01.090 --> 00:30:01.890 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Wow.

00:30:01.890 --> 00:30:07.710 align:middle line:84%
>>MCKENNA: And so now
what's going to happen is--

00:30:07.710 --> 00:30:09.970 align:middle line:84%
there's people on air
doing this right now--

00:30:09.970 --> 00:30:12.330 align:middle line:84%
so as they're doing
it, some of the people

00:30:12.330 --> 00:30:15.360 align:middle line:84%
are going to be like, oh
boy, I can really feel it,

00:30:15.360 --> 00:30:17.610 align:middle line:84%
and something
doesn't feel right.

00:30:17.610 --> 00:30:20.340 align:middle line:90%
And that is your fear.

00:30:20.340 --> 00:30:24.090 align:middle line:84%
You did not clear all the fear--
and you couldn't, probably,

00:30:24.090 --> 00:30:25.560 align:middle line:90%
for some of you--

00:30:25.560 --> 00:30:27.420 align:middle line:90%
but just, OK, what is my fear?

00:30:27.420 --> 00:30:29.430 align:middle line:90%
What's my fear of this?

00:30:29.430 --> 00:30:31.140 align:middle line:90%
And then let go of that fear.

00:30:31.140 --> 00:30:35.760 align:middle line:84%
I'm going to accept this, I'm
just not going to fear it.

00:30:35.760 --> 00:30:41.130 align:middle line:84%
And then what will happen is
the body's going to calm down.

00:30:41.130 --> 00:30:46.260 align:middle line:84%
And then as soon as it's
calmed down and it's there,

00:30:46.260 --> 00:30:48.330 align:middle line:84%
what you're going
to do is you're

00:30:48.330 --> 00:30:52.050 align:middle line:84%
going to imagine you're
pulling this right

00:30:52.050 --> 00:30:54.750 align:middle line:84%
down the center
of the body, right

00:30:54.750 --> 00:30:58.260 align:middle line:90%
down to the base of your torso.

00:30:58.260 --> 00:31:04.710 align:middle line:84%
For a man, this is between
the anus and testicles.

00:31:04.710 --> 00:31:07.260 align:middle line:84%
There's the first chakra,
and it points downward.

00:31:07.260 --> 00:31:12.210 align:middle line:84%
In a female, it is the cervix,
and it also points downward.

00:31:12.210 --> 00:31:15.750 align:middle line:84%
Now, this is the
area of creation.

00:31:15.750 --> 00:31:18.655 align:middle line:84%
And it's also the lowest,
slowest vibration.

00:31:18.655 --> 00:31:19.530 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Absolutely.

00:31:19.530 --> 00:31:23.640 align:middle line:84%
Red, survival, first chakra,
creation-- procreation.

00:31:23.640 --> 00:31:24.530 align:middle line:90%
>>MCKENNA: Correct.

00:31:24.530 --> 00:31:26.130 align:middle line:90%
Yeah, so we're pulling it down.

00:31:26.130 --> 00:31:27.630 align:middle line:84%
Just imagine you're
pulling it down.

00:31:27.630 --> 00:31:29.520 align:middle line:84%
And you're going
to park it there.

00:31:29.520 --> 00:31:30.870 align:middle line:90%
You're going to park it there.

00:31:30.870 --> 00:31:34.250 align:middle line:84%
And when you do, there's--
one of two things is going

00:31:34.250 --> 00:31:35.050 align:middle line:90%
to happen.

00:31:35.050 --> 00:31:38.370 align:middle line:84%
You're going to
have this sensation,

00:31:38.370 --> 00:31:42.600 align:middle line:84%
and/or you're going to be
like, it doesn't want to stay,

00:31:42.600 --> 00:31:44.580 align:middle line:90%
it's popping back up.

00:31:44.580 --> 00:31:48.850 align:middle line:84%
If it's popping back up, then
that means you have a fear.

00:31:48.850 --> 00:31:50.880 align:middle line:84%
Ask, what's the
fear, why won't you

00:31:50.880 --> 00:31:52.980 align:middle line:90%
stay, why won't you stay down?

00:31:52.980 --> 00:31:55.500 align:middle line:90%
Again, let go of the fear.

00:31:55.500 --> 00:31:57.540 align:middle line:90%
There may be a couple fears.

00:31:57.540 --> 00:31:59.377 align:middle line:90%
Keep letting go of your fear.

00:31:59.377 --> 00:32:01.710 align:middle line:84%
Now, the amazing thing here
is people are always saying,

00:32:01.710 --> 00:32:02.640 align:middle line:90%
why didn't it manifest?

00:32:02.640 --> 00:32:04.432 align:middle line:84%
I've been working on
this law of attraction

00:32:04.432 --> 00:32:05.670 align:middle line:90%
and, you know, la, la, la.

00:32:05.670 --> 00:32:08.790 align:middle line:84%
Well, there's all these
little subtle things

00:32:08.790 --> 00:32:14.010 align:middle line:84%
that you weren't aware
of that you had fears on.

00:32:14.010 --> 00:32:19.020 align:middle line:84%
So you'll know it now, and
when this descends now,

00:32:19.020 --> 00:32:22.230 align:middle line:84%
you pull it down to
that first chakra--

00:32:22.230 --> 00:32:26.070 align:middle line:84%
when it stays there and you're
not trying to keep it there

00:32:26.070 --> 00:32:31.480 align:middle line:84%
but it's staying there, you
will have a completely different

00:32:31.480 --> 00:32:32.560 align:middle line:90%
point of view.

00:32:32.560 --> 00:32:38.290 align:middle line:84%
You're like, this is going
down, this is happening now.

00:32:38.290 --> 00:32:39.250 align:middle line:90%
And guess what?

00:32:39.250 --> 00:32:41.290 align:middle line:90%
It is.

00:32:41.290 --> 00:32:44.407 align:middle line:90%
So for some of you--

00:32:44.407 --> 00:32:45.990 align:middle line:84%
another thing-- some
of you were like,

00:32:45.990 --> 00:32:47.823 align:middle line:84%
I didn't feel it in my
body, I can't feel it

00:32:47.823 --> 00:32:49.890 align:middle line:90%
in my body, la, la, la, la, la.

00:32:49.890 --> 00:32:54.750 align:middle line:84%
Well, I'm going to take
you the longer route.

00:32:54.750 --> 00:32:58.950 align:middle line:84%
And the longer route is you
take this out of the field,

00:32:58.950 --> 00:33:01.950 align:middle line:84%
and we're going to bring
it in through the top

00:33:01.950 --> 00:33:04.710 align:middle line:84%
of the head, which
is the opening, which

00:33:04.710 --> 00:33:08.100 align:middle line:90%
is the back of the base chakra.

00:33:08.100 --> 00:33:11.520 align:middle line:84%
So we bring it in here, and
then we just bring it right down

00:33:11.520 --> 00:33:13.480 align:middle line:90%
and through.

00:33:13.480 --> 00:33:17.620 align:middle line:84%
The downgrade process
that we're going through--

00:33:17.620 --> 00:33:20.470 align:middle line:84%
when you felt it in
your heart, this thing

00:33:20.470 --> 00:33:22.840 align:middle line:84%
has already gone through
a downgrade process.

00:33:22.840 --> 00:33:24.760 align:middle line:90%
It's in your heart already.

00:33:24.760 --> 00:33:27.370 align:middle line:84%
So all you're doing is just
pulling that out and just

00:33:27.370 --> 00:33:29.830 align:middle line:84%
pulling it right
down to the base.

00:33:29.830 --> 00:33:33.280 align:middle line:84%
Where the lowest,
slowest vibration is,

00:33:33.280 --> 00:33:35.980 align:middle line:90%
it's closest to manifestation.

00:33:35.980 --> 00:33:39.070 align:middle line:90%
It is hermetic teaching.

00:33:39.070 --> 00:33:41.620 align:middle line:90%
As within, so without.

00:33:41.620 --> 00:33:47.290 align:middle line:84%
Everything goes from a high
vibration of thought downwards.

00:33:47.290 --> 00:33:50.830 align:middle line:84%
Here, we start with
ideas and then thoughts,

00:33:50.830 --> 00:33:53.860 align:middle line:84%
and then we start
talking about it.

00:33:53.860 --> 00:33:55.570 align:middle line:90%
Abracadabra.

00:33:55.570 --> 00:33:58.300 align:middle line:90%
With my words, I create.

00:33:58.300 --> 00:34:00.948 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And that's interesting
because many times in life,

00:34:00.948 --> 00:34:03.490 align:middle line:84%
I've known people who say, oh,
I don't want to talk about it,

00:34:03.490 --> 00:34:05.170 align:middle line:84%
I don't want to jinx
it, I don't want

00:34:05.170 --> 00:34:07.480 align:middle line:84%
to be made a fool of
if it doesn't happen.

00:34:07.480 --> 00:34:09.005 align:middle line:90%
Where I feel the opposite.

00:34:09.005 --> 00:34:11.380 align:middle line:84%
If you want to create something,
start chatting about it.

00:34:11.380 --> 00:34:12.760 align:middle line:84%
Start saying, you know,
I really want to--

00:34:12.760 --> 00:34:14.510 align:middle line:84%
I'm really feeling
kind of like this could

00:34:14.510 --> 00:34:16.239 align:middle line:90%
be an interesting direction.

00:34:16.239 --> 00:34:18.130 align:middle line:84%
You are actually in
the process of creation

00:34:18.130 --> 00:34:19.760 align:middle line:90%
by talking about it.

00:34:19.760 --> 00:34:22.030 align:middle line:84%
Now, granted, there's
espionage and--

00:34:22.030 --> 00:34:23.710 align:middle line:84%
corporate espionage
and these kinds

00:34:23.710 --> 00:34:25.900 align:middle line:84%
of things that some people
have to worry about.

00:34:25.900 --> 00:34:28.360 align:middle line:84%
But for most of us, when we're
trying to manifest something

00:34:28.360 --> 00:34:32.469 align:middle line:84%
in life, to become enthused
and excited and put words to it

00:34:32.469 --> 00:34:34.280 align:middle line:84%
is actually an
important part of it.

00:34:34.280 --> 00:34:35.080 align:middle line:90%
>>MCKENNA: Yes.

00:34:35.080 --> 00:34:39.850 align:middle line:84%
Well, it is-- in the beginning,
"let there be light."

00:34:39.850 --> 00:34:42.159 align:middle line:90%
It was spoken.

00:34:42.159 --> 00:34:44.620 align:middle line:90%
So it is manifestation.

00:34:44.620 --> 00:34:47.350 align:middle line:90%
So it is one right through--

00:34:47.350 --> 00:34:49.449 align:middle line:84%
we're downgrading,
so these chakras

00:34:49.449 --> 00:34:52.760 align:middle line:84%
have lower and slower
vibrations as you go.

00:34:52.760 --> 00:34:57.400 align:middle line:84%
So as we go down, here's
the lower, slower action,

00:34:57.400 --> 00:35:02.360 align:middle line:84%
and then right down to that
base, which is our creation.

00:35:02.360 --> 00:35:03.740 align:middle line:90%
So that's how we do it.

00:35:03.740 --> 00:35:07.960 align:middle line:84%
It's so simple, and I can't
wait to get all the stories out

00:35:07.960 --> 00:35:10.540 align:middle line:84%
of everybody that's
going to enjoy this.

00:35:10.540 --> 00:35:11.320 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: People will
go back and watch it.

00:35:11.320 --> 00:35:12.737 align:middle line:84%
If they're not
doing it right now,

00:35:12.737 --> 00:35:14.620 align:middle line:84%
they'll go back and
pause this, go back

00:35:14.620 --> 00:35:16.690 align:middle line:90%
and start doing the process.

00:35:16.690 --> 00:35:18.580 align:middle line:84%
Now, we're going to
talk about one anecdote

00:35:18.580 --> 00:35:20.413 align:middle line:84%
because it's a guy that
you're working with,

00:35:20.413 --> 00:35:21.910 align:middle line:90%
he wanted to grow his business.

00:35:21.910 --> 00:35:23.320 align:middle line:90%
These are the Bio-Well images.

00:35:23.320 --> 00:35:24.820 align:middle line:90%
Let's take a look at these.

00:35:24.820 --> 00:35:28.000 align:middle line:84%
Tell this story, and let's
look at how it actually

00:35:28.000 --> 00:35:29.860 align:middle line:90%
manifests on the imagery.

00:35:29.860 --> 00:35:33.280 align:middle line:84%
And the Bio-Well was created
by Konstantin Korotkov,

00:35:33.280 --> 00:35:38.260 align:middle line:84%
the famous Soviet Academy of
Sciences Russian scientist

00:35:38.260 --> 00:35:41.350 align:middle line:84%
who understands energy
to a sublime extent

00:35:41.350 --> 00:35:44.980 align:middle line:84%
and has been able to actually
make it so we can see it.

00:35:44.980 --> 00:35:46.105 align:middle line:90%
>>MCKENNA: Yeah, thank God.

00:35:46.105 --> 00:35:48.650 align:middle line:90%


00:35:48.650 --> 00:35:51.850 align:middle line:84%
I've been helping people
with this for a long time,

00:35:51.850 --> 00:35:53.980 align:middle line:90%
and when--

00:35:53.980 --> 00:35:56.125 align:middle line:84%
I knew, obviously--
people are calling,

00:35:56.125 --> 00:35:58.965 align:middle line:84%
hey, you know what
happened today?

00:35:58.965 --> 00:36:01.570 align:middle line:84%
All kinds of things
are happening.

00:36:01.570 --> 00:36:05.710 align:middle line:84%
But I was like, well,
OK, I want to do a test.

00:36:05.710 --> 00:36:08.540 align:middle line:84%
Let's see what's going
on in the energy system.

00:36:08.540 --> 00:36:09.430 align:middle line:90%
Let's see.

00:36:09.430 --> 00:36:14.650 align:middle line:84%
So I had a guy in, and I
was working with him anyway.

00:36:14.650 --> 00:36:17.210 align:middle line:84%
So I was like, oh,
can we do a before?

00:36:17.210 --> 00:36:19.190 align:middle line:90%
So we did a before.

00:36:19.190 --> 00:36:21.320 align:middle line:10%
>>REGINA: So what are we
looking at in this chart?

00:36:21.320 --> 00:36:23.740 align:middle line:10%
>>MCKENNA: OK, so what we're
looking at here is across

00:36:23.740 --> 00:36:24.970 align:middle line:10%
the bottom, there's--

00:36:24.970 --> 00:36:32.650 align:middle line:10%
Bio-Well reads all of the
energy in every single organ.

00:36:32.650 --> 00:36:37.210 align:middle line:10%
31 different organs are listed
here, I think, or systems.

00:36:37.210 --> 00:36:41.620 align:middle line:10%
And it will read the
left and right energy--

00:36:41.620 --> 00:36:46.420 align:middle line:10%
or sympathetic/parasympathetic
Ida/Pingala, Yin/Yang--

00:36:46.420 --> 00:36:49.900 align:middle line:10%
and the bars that are
lit up are the ones

00:36:49.900 --> 00:36:56.260 align:middle line:10%
that are out of balance,
that the two energies are not

00:36:56.260 --> 00:36:57.100 align:middle line:10%
in balance.

00:36:57.100 --> 00:36:59.020 align:middle line:10%
>>REGINA: And those would be the
dark kind of purply-blue ones?

00:36:59.020 --> 00:37:00.103 align:middle line:10%
>>MCKENNA: That's correct.

00:37:00.103 --> 00:37:04.270 align:middle line:10%
Now, up the side, this is
the actual electrical charge.

00:37:04.270 --> 00:37:06.470 align:middle line:10%
It's measured in joules.

00:37:06.470 --> 00:37:10.930 align:middle line:10%
So we are an electrical being,
and this device actually

00:37:10.930 --> 00:37:12.170 align:middle line:10%
measures it.

00:37:12.170 --> 00:37:16.270 align:middle line:10%
So the cool thing here
is that we measured him,

00:37:16.270 --> 00:37:23.020 align:middle line:10%
and number 12, 13, 14 on
this are out of balance.

00:37:23.020 --> 00:37:24.610 align:middle line:10%
I think 12 and 13
out of balance.

00:37:24.610 --> 00:37:28.720 align:middle line:10%
But these are the base energies.

00:37:28.720 --> 00:37:32.560 align:middle line:84%
There are your coccyx
and your urinary

00:37:32.560 --> 00:37:33.692 align:middle line:90%
and these sorts of things.

00:37:33.692 --> 00:37:34.900 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: First chakra stuff.

00:37:34.900 --> 00:37:38.590 align:middle line:84%
>>MCKENNA: First chakra--
they're all first chakra stuff.

00:37:38.590 --> 00:37:40.930 align:middle line:90%
So this is his before shot.

00:37:40.930 --> 00:37:42.610 align:middle line:90%
Now, this guy was blocked.

00:37:42.610 --> 00:37:46.600 align:middle line:84%
He'd been a coach and kind of
a motivational speaker forever,

00:37:46.600 --> 00:37:51.790 align:middle line:84%
but he didn't have the
reach that he wanted.

00:37:51.790 --> 00:37:56.740 align:middle line:84%
So he was like, listen, Bill,
I want to be on large podcasts.

00:37:56.740 --> 00:37:58.120 align:middle line:90%
This is the exact words.

00:37:58.120 --> 00:38:00.070 align:middle line:84%
"I want to be on
large podcasts."

00:38:00.070 --> 00:38:02.470 align:middle line:90%
I was like, OK, large podcasts.

00:38:02.470 --> 00:38:05.830 align:middle line:84%
Well, tell me, what
is preventing you?

00:38:05.830 --> 00:38:08.025 align:middle line:90%
What is in conflict?

00:38:08.025 --> 00:38:09.400 align:middle line:84%
And he said,
there's no conflict.

00:38:09.400 --> 00:38:10.600 align:middle line:90%
And I was like, yes.

00:38:10.600 --> 00:38:12.070 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So you take
him through the process.

00:38:12.070 --> 00:38:13.070 align:middle line:90%
>>MCKENNA: There you go.

00:38:13.070 --> 00:38:15.370 align:middle line:90%


00:38:15.370 --> 00:38:19.510 align:middle line:84%
For him it was, people are
famous, they get attacked.

00:38:19.510 --> 00:38:22.240 align:middle line:84%
And so we cleared
that-- ta ta ta ta ta.

00:38:22.240 --> 00:38:24.070 align:middle line:90%
OK, where is the big podcasts?

00:38:24.070 --> 00:38:26.980 align:middle line:84%
And being really well
known, beyond big podcasts,

00:38:26.980 --> 00:38:31.060 align:middle line:84%
it was, for him,
having real visibility.

00:38:31.060 --> 00:38:33.230 align:middle line:90%
Well, pulled it out.

00:38:33.230 --> 00:38:35.230 align:middle line:90%
We went through, pulled it down.

00:38:35.230 --> 00:38:39.430 align:middle line:84%
And when he pulled it down,
he had this, oh man, this

00:38:39.430 --> 00:38:42.310 align:middle line:84%
is happening, I feel
completely different about it.

00:38:42.310 --> 00:38:45.230 align:middle line:90%
And it was very physical.

00:38:45.230 --> 00:38:46.300 align:middle line:90%
We did some breath.

00:38:46.300 --> 00:38:48.850 align:middle line:84%
So I did some
breath work with him

00:38:48.850 --> 00:38:52.327 align:middle line:84%
because the breath
will energize as well.

00:38:52.327 --> 00:38:54.910 align:middle line:84%
So tummo breath-- there's lots
of different breaths out there.

00:38:54.910 --> 00:38:57.400 align:middle line:84%
But I just did a little
bit of breath with him.

00:38:57.400 --> 00:39:00.250 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: To kind of fuse
it in, get it to settle.

00:39:00.250 --> 00:39:04.090 align:middle line:84%
>>MCKENNA: Well, yeah, and to
build a little bit of energy.

00:39:04.090 --> 00:39:06.640 align:middle line:84%
So I said, OK, great,
we'll take another reading.

00:39:06.640 --> 00:39:08.680 align:middle line:84%
We took this reading, and
look at what happened.

00:39:08.680 --> 00:39:09.940 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Oh, my God.

00:39:09.940 --> 00:39:11.770 align:middle line:84%
>>MCKENNA: Like we
talked about earlier,

00:39:11.770 --> 00:39:15.297 align:middle line:84%
the base goes into balance, the
rest of it goes into balance--

00:39:15.297 --> 00:39:17.755 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And all of the energy
is higher across the board.

00:39:17.755 --> 00:39:18.010 align:middle line:90%
Way higher.

00:39:18.010 --> 00:39:19.010 align:middle line:90%
>>MCKENNA: That's right.

00:39:19.010 --> 00:39:20.740 align:middle line:10%
Now, this is a
fairly unusual one

00:39:20.740 --> 00:39:22.840 align:middle line:10%
because I've done others where--

00:39:22.840 --> 00:39:27.430 align:middle line:10%
but the common denominator
is that the base chakra,

00:39:27.430 --> 00:39:30.820 align:middle line:10%
the ones that represent
that, become imbalanced

00:39:30.820 --> 00:39:32.290 align:middle line:10%
and they increase.

00:39:32.290 --> 00:39:35.050 align:middle line:10%
Doing a little breath work
will help to bring everything,

00:39:35.050 --> 00:39:36.640 align:middle line:10%
for sure, into balance.

00:39:36.640 --> 00:39:40.930 align:middle line:84%
Now, when I read him the
second time, I was like, well,

00:39:40.930 --> 00:39:41.740 align:middle line:90%
guess what?

00:39:41.740 --> 00:39:43.930 align:middle line:90%
I know what's going down.

00:39:43.930 --> 00:39:45.340 align:middle line:90%
Get ready.

00:39:45.340 --> 00:39:46.930 align:middle line:90%
He leaves.

00:39:46.930 --> 00:39:49.930 align:middle line:84%
15 minutes-- 15-- tick,
tick, tick, tick--

00:39:49.930 --> 00:39:51.710 align:middle line:90%
15 minutes.

00:39:51.710 --> 00:39:54.250 align:middle line:90%
I get a phone call.

00:39:54.250 --> 00:39:57.220 align:middle line:84%
You're not going
to believe this.

00:39:57.220 --> 00:40:00.490 align:middle line:84%
He left me, he had a
call to a customer,

00:40:00.490 --> 00:40:06.160 align:middle line:84%
and his customer was so
thrilled with the changes

00:40:06.160 --> 00:40:07.630 align:middle line:90%
that he helped with.

00:40:07.630 --> 00:40:10.070 align:middle line:84%
He was like, this happened
and that happened and la, la,

00:40:10.070 --> 00:40:13.790 align:middle line:84%
la la, and he goes,
how can I help you?

00:40:13.790 --> 00:40:16.260 align:middle line:90%
And he goes, well--

00:40:16.260 --> 00:40:18.450 align:middle line:84%
and he had his
permission to speak now--

00:40:18.450 --> 00:40:19.380 align:middle line:90%
you know what?

00:40:19.380 --> 00:40:21.120 align:middle line:84%
Actually, do you
have any friends that

00:40:21.120 --> 00:40:23.700 align:middle line:90%
are large podcasts that can--

00:40:23.700 --> 00:40:25.800 align:middle line:84%
the guy said, well,
of course, yeah.

00:40:25.800 --> 00:40:29.160 align:middle line:90%
Actually, the 3 million used--

00:40:29.160 --> 00:40:30.540 align:middle line:90%
2 million, 1 million--

00:40:30.540 --> 00:40:34.740 align:middle line:84%
I'll get you on, I got
that, hold on a second.

00:40:34.740 --> 00:40:37.650 align:middle line:90%
Getting on all these big shows.

00:40:37.650 --> 00:40:40.300 align:middle line:84%
And then the story
just continued.

00:40:40.300 --> 00:40:42.420 align:middle line:90%
It didn't stop.

00:40:42.420 --> 00:40:45.420 align:middle line:84%
I was getting on the plane
here and I got a phone call,

00:40:45.420 --> 00:40:48.600 align:middle line:84%
and he said, oh, my gosh, you're
not going to believe this.

00:40:48.600 --> 00:40:51.990 align:middle line:84%
I was going on another
podcast, and somehow I

00:40:51.990 --> 00:40:54.930 align:middle line:84%
got on with the owner of
the entire radio station,

00:40:54.930 --> 00:40:57.720 align:middle line:84%
and he starts talking to me
and was like, you know what?

00:40:57.720 --> 00:40:59.550 align:middle line:90%
You need your own radio show.

00:40:59.550 --> 00:41:02.190 align:middle line:84%
I'm going to give
you a radio show.

00:41:02.190 --> 00:41:05.850 align:middle line:84%
Something like over
a million listeners.

00:41:05.850 --> 00:41:06.990 align:middle line:90%
So it was like--

00:41:06.990 --> 00:41:09.510 align:middle line:90%
I mean, it just exploded.

00:41:09.510 --> 00:41:12.900 align:middle line:84%
But he had cleared
out his resistances.

00:41:12.900 --> 00:41:16.135 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: This is where
we say, results may vary.

00:41:16.135 --> 00:41:17.580 align:middle line:90%
That's our little disclaimer.

00:41:17.580 --> 00:41:19.470 align:middle line:84%
That's obviously an
exceptional situation,

00:41:19.470 --> 00:41:22.680 align:middle line:84%
but the point is, you can
visibly see what happened here.

00:41:22.680 --> 00:41:25.800 align:middle line:84%
And to varying degrees, that's
happening with each one of us

00:41:25.800 --> 00:41:27.660 align:middle line:84%
when we commit
ourselves in this way.

00:41:27.660 --> 00:41:28.670 align:middle line:90%
>>MCKENNA: Yes.

00:41:28.670 --> 00:41:30.420 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: We only have
a few minutes left.

00:41:30.420 --> 00:41:32.430 align:middle line:84%
That's exceptional
to get through all

00:41:32.430 --> 00:41:34.410 align:middle line:84%
of this, all of
these techniques,

00:41:34.410 --> 00:41:38.070 align:middle line:84%
get through what it looks like
from the Bio-Well standpoint.

00:41:38.070 --> 00:41:40.470 align:middle line:84%
Now, in the next
few minutes, kind of

00:41:40.470 --> 00:41:44.700 align:middle line:84%
wrap up how we can
engage with this easily,

00:41:44.700 --> 00:41:47.480 align:middle line:84%
readily, kind of
any day on anything.

00:41:47.480 --> 00:41:51.723 align:middle line:84%
>>MCKENNA: OK, so this is
something that you can use.

00:41:51.723 --> 00:41:52.890 align:middle line:90%
It's not like the big thing.

00:41:52.890 --> 00:41:55.800 align:middle line:84%
It's not becoming
rich and famous.

00:41:55.800 --> 00:41:59.490 align:middle line:90%
But it's the simple things.

00:41:59.490 --> 00:42:03.480 align:middle line:84%
There's this one
couple that was--

00:42:03.480 --> 00:42:07.740 align:middle line:84%
the wife was like-- she
wanted to drive the car--

00:42:07.740 --> 00:42:11.910 align:middle line:84%
they had a nice car, and then he
had-- they call it the whoopty.

00:42:11.910 --> 00:42:15.870 align:middle line:84%
The rims were all jacked
up and wipers not working.

00:42:15.870 --> 00:42:17.880 align:middle line:84%
And so she don't want
to drive the whoopty.

00:42:17.880 --> 00:42:22.680 align:middle line:84%
So anyway, she's like,
I'm going to-- the car's

00:42:22.680 --> 00:42:23.580 align:middle line:90%
going to get fixed.

00:42:23.580 --> 00:42:25.420 align:middle line:90%
She didn't say anything.

00:42:25.420 --> 00:42:28.120 align:middle line:84%
Next day-- didn't say anything
to the husband, just cleared

00:42:28.120 --> 00:42:29.800 align:middle line:90%
out the financial thing.

00:42:29.800 --> 00:42:34.090 align:middle line:84%
Next day, he's like, hey
honey, look at the car.

00:42:34.090 --> 00:42:37.150 align:middle line:90%
Hubcaps, wipers fixed.

00:42:37.150 --> 00:42:39.940 align:middle line:84%
So it's the ordinary
things of life

00:42:39.940 --> 00:42:43.580 align:middle line:84%
that you can do right
here, right now.

00:42:43.580 --> 00:42:46.960 align:middle line:84%
And you don't have to go
through a big meditation on it.

00:42:46.960 --> 00:42:49.540 align:middle line:84%
You know already
with the block is.

00:42:49.540 --> 00:42:52.150 align:middle line:84%
Just settle yourself
and clap it out

00:42:52.150 --> 00:42:55.990 align:middle line:84%
and pull it in and
put it right there.

00:42:55.990 --> 00:42:59.050 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: I love the directness,
the simplicity, the elegance.

00:42:59.050 --> 00:43:02.230 align:middle line:84%
You don't need to practice
a particular meditation

00:43:02.230 --> 00:43:05.030 align:middle line:84%
or posture for 25
years to get there.

00:43:05.030 --> 00:43:08.630 align:middle line:84%
So I like anything that's
really direct and effective.

00:43:08.630 --> 00:43:12.820 align:middle line:84%
So I'll play with this a
little later on myself.

00:43:12.820 --> 00:43:16.230 align:middle line:84%
>>MCKENNA: Yeah,
well, it's just fun.

00:43:16.230 --> 00:43:17.080 align:middle line:90%
It's just fun.

00:43:17.080 --> 00:43:20.800 align:middle line:10%
And you can see
what shifts for you.

00:43:20.800 --> 00:43:22.960 align:middle line:10%
And there's a dynamic effect.

00:43:22.960 --> 00:43:25.870 align:middle line:10%
When you clear out these
things in your field,

00:43:25.870 --> 00:43:27.520 align:middle line:10%
there's all kinds
of other things

00:43:27.520 --> 00:43:28.180 align:middle line:10%
that are affected
you would not know.

00:43:28.180 --> 00:43:30.727 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Well, there has to
be because we're all connected.

00:43:30.727 --> 00:43:32.560 align:middle line:84%
And if you're connected
deeply with someone,

00:43:32.560 --> 00:43:34.018 align:middle line:84%
anything happening
in your field is

00:43:34.018 --> 00:43:36.970 align:middle line:84%
going to impact their field
and their greater mind.

00:43:36.970 --> 00:43:38.170 align:middle line:90%
So it makes total sense.

00:43:38.170 --> 00:43:40.300 align:middle line:10%
If you can take the
initiative to make it

00:43:40.300 --> 00:43:42.040 align:middle line:10%
straight in your
own field, things

00:43:42.040 --> 00:43:45.140 align:middle line:10%
are going to start happening
to you and those around you.

00:43:45.140 --> 00:43:47.710 align:middle line:84%
And on top of everything
else, there's a little gift.

00:43:47.710 --> 00:43:49.330 align:middle line:84%
I'll tell people
about it right now.

00:43:49.330 --> 00:43:50.980 align:middle line:90%
OK, thanks so much, Bill.

00:43:50.980 --> 00:43:53.650 align:middle line:84%

00:43:57.790 --> 00:44:00.940 align:middle line:84%
called "Tiny Book
of Big Manifesting."

00:44:00.940 --> 00:44:03.763 align:middle line:84%
