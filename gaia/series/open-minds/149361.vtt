>>REGINA MEREDITH:
For those among you

00:00:30.200 --> 00:00:34.040 align:middle line:10%
who have not studied and used
ayahuasca and toad medicine,

00:00:34.040 --> 00:00:37.490 align:middle line:10%
Rak Razam has filled his
experiences in the Amazonian

00:00:37.490 --> 00:00:39.414 align:middle line:10%
jungle and brought it
back to share with us.

00:00:39.414 --> 00:00:41.330 align:middle line:84%
We're going to talk about
that and a whole lot

00:00:41.330 --> 00:00:44.180 align:middle line:84%
more about the whole notion
of expanding consciousness

00:00:44.180 --> 00:00:46.835 align:middle line:84%
that's rising to the surface
now in the year 2017.

00:00:46.835 --> 00:00:48.460 align:middle line:84%
It actually started
prior to this,

00:00:48.460 --> 00:00:52.190 align:middle line:90%
but let's go back even further.

00:00:52.190 --> 00:00:54.890 align:middle line:84%
What's interesting to me
about all of the-- it's

00:00:54.890 --> 00:00:56.720 align:middle line:84%
a different kind
of medicine that's

00:00:56.720 --> 00:01:00.200 align:middle line:84%
rising to the surface
from the '60s and '70s.

00:01:00.200 --> 00:01:02.720 align:middle line:84%
Astrologically, the
time we're in right now

00:01:02.720 --> 00:01:05.180 align:middle line:84%
is really reflecting
the revolutionary time

00:01:05.180 --> 00:01:09.160 align:middle line:84%
of the '60s, where
recreational drug use really

00:01:09.160 --> 00:01:10.880 align:middle line:90%
came into popular use.

00:01:10.880 --> 00:01:15.230 align:middle line:84%
And can you just kind of
tie these periods together

00:01:15.230 --> 00:01:18.620 align:middle line:84%
and what you feel is surfacing
within the human psyche that's

00:01:18.620 --> 00:01:19.610 align:middle line:90%
calling out.

00:01:19.610 --> 00:01:21.350 align:middle line:10%
>>RAK RAZAM: Thank you, Regina.

00:01:21.350 --> 00:01:23.120 align:middle line:10%
Essentially, what's
coming back now

00:01:23.120 --> 00:01:24.676 align:middle line:10%
full circle isn't something new.

00:01:24.676 --> 00:01:25.925 align:middle line:10%
It's something very, very old.

00:01:25.925 --> 00:01:29.330 align:middle line:10%
It's something which Western
culture over the last 500,000

00:01:29.330 --> 00:01:32.450 align:middle line:10%
to few thousands of
years, because, I guess,

00:01:32.450 --> 00:01:36.590 align:middle line:10%
of a bias with religion and
different sort of conflicting,

00:01:36.590 --> 00:01:40.310 align:middle line:10%
you know, belief systems, saw
these indigenous tribes, which

00:01:40.310 --> 00:01:43.360 align:middle line:10%
used plant medicines,
which alter consciousness

00:01:43.360 --> 00:01:45.660 align:middle line:10%
as the work of the devil,
things like that, you know.

00:01:45.660 --> 00:01:49.010 align:middle line:84%
But these cultures have been
caretakers for plant medicines,

00:01:49.010 --> 00:01:50.600 align:middle line:90%
which can change consciousness.

00:01:50.600 --> 00:01:53.570 align:middle line:84%
We call this entheogens
nowadays from the Greek,

00:01:53.570 --> 00:01:55.850 align:middle line:90%
"to invoke the divine within."

00:01:55.850 --> 00:01:57.620 align:middle line:84%
And there are things
which tribal peoples

00:01:57.620 --> 00:02:02.000 align:middle line:84%
have been caretakers for for
millennia, time immemorial.

00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:05.510 align:middle line:84%
And these substances, when we
take them in the right context,

00:02:05.510 --> 00:02:08.190 align:middle line:84%
and in tribal cultures, they
don't do things recreationally

00:02:08.190 --> 00:02:09.949 align:middle line:90%
in this context.

00:02:09.949 --> 00:02:12.470 align:middle line:84%
They use these
substances as medicines

00:02:12.470 --> 00:02:16.100 align:middle line:84%
specifically for initiations
and to help mediate the energy

00:02:16.100 --> 00:02:17.990 align:middle line:84%
and the psyche of
their tribe to keep

00:02:17.990 --> 00:02:20.690 align:middle line:84%
them connected to the web of
life and to the planet herself.

00:02:20.690 --> 00:02:23.910 align:middle line:84%
And they understand that
the planet, Mother Gaia, she

00:02:23.910 --> 00:02:25.730 align:middle line:90%
secretes these substances.

00:02:25.730 --> 00:02:27.860 align:middle line:84%
And they have very
specific relationships,

00:02:27.860 --> 00:02:30.950 align:middle line:84%
we know now with neurochemistry,
with our own brain structure.

00:02:30.950 --> 00:02:33.830 align:middle line:84%
And they've done lots
of tests with EG and MRI

00:02:33.830 --> 00:02:37.550 align:middle line:84%
in recent years looking at the
legalization and medicalization

00:02:37.550 --> 00:02:39.092 align:middle line:90%
of these substances.

00:02:39.092 --> 00:02:40.550 align:middle line:84%
And they understand
they switch off

00:02:40.550 --> 00:02:42.980 align:middle line:84%
different aspects of
our default mode network

00:02:42.980 --> 00:02:46.010 align:middle line:84%
of the brain, which are
involved in the sense of ego.

00:02:46.010 --> 00:02:47.390 align:middle line:90%
And they bring us back.

00:02:47.390 --> 00:02:50.270 align:middle line:84%
When that's reduced, they
bring our consciousness

00:02:50.270 --> 00:02:55.962 align:middle line:84%
to a more unified and organic
sort of unfolding with nature.

00:02:55.962 --> 00:02:57.170 align:middle line:90%
That's on a scientific level.

00:02:57.170 --> 00:02:59.660 align:middle line:84%
So tribal people have
had these medicines,

00:02:59.660 --> 00:03:01.070 align:middle line:84%
and it's part of
what keeps them,

00:03:01.070 --> 00:03:03.710 align:middle line:84%
I think, in synergy
with the earth.

00:03:03.710 --> 00:03:07.310 align:middle line:84%
So Western culture started
to sever that connection,

00:03:07.310 --> 00:03:08.780 align:middle line:84%
that relationship
with the planet

00:03:08.780 --> 00:03:12.260 align:middle line:84%
and the psychoactive medicines
hundreds, if not thousands,

00:03:12.260 --> 00:03:13.790 align:middle line:90%
of years ago.

00:03:13.790 --> 00:03:18.560 align:middle line:84%
And because of that, we've
had a vacuum in our culture,

00:03:18.560 --> 00:03:21.470 align:middle line:84%
and we've pretty much killed
off the idea of the medicine

00:03:21.470 --> 00:03:26.150 align:middle line:84%
person, the wise man or woman,
the herbalist, the witches,

00:03:26.150 --> 00:03:27.950 align:middle line:90%
the warlocks, and the shamans.

00:03:27.950 --> 00:03:31.040 align:middle line:84%
And coincidentally, without
that mediation of the plants

00:03:31.040 --> 00:03:32.840 align:middle line:84%
and our relationship
with the plants,

00:03:32.840 --> 00:03:34.786 align:middle line:84%
we've also lost our
relationship with nature,

00:03:34.786 --> 00:03:36.410 align:middle line:84%
and we've seen it as
something separate

00:03:36.410 --> 00:03:39.890 align:middle line:84%
from ourselves that we just
take from as a commodity.

00:03:39.890 --> 00:03:43.380 align:middle line:84%
And the cumulative effect
over many hundreds of years

00:03:43.380 --> 00:03:46.800 align:middle line:84%
is this peak of empire
and of Western culture

00:03:46.800 --> 00:03:48.840 align:middle line:84%
we have now, which is in
a planetary emergency.

00:03:48.840 --> 00:03:49.640 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:03:49.640 --> 00:03:51.440 align:middle line:84%
>>RAZAM: Because we didn't
have this relationship

00:03:51.440 --> 00:03:52.310 align:middle line:90%
with the planet.

00:03:52.310 --> 00:03:54.770 align:middle line:10%
So what happened
back in the '60s,

00:03:54.770 --> 00:03:58.430 align:middle line:10%
coming on from some discoveries
in the laboratory in the '40s,

00:03:58.430 --> 00:04:00.830 align:middle line:10%
was this-- essentially,
one of the main drivers

00:04:00.830 --> 00:04:04.130 align:middle line:10%
was this chemical LSD,
which was made by a lab

00:04:04.130 --> 00:04:07.670 align:middle line:10%
by Albert Hoffman, a Swiss
chemist in the 1940s,

00:04:07.670 --> 00:04:09.800 align:middle line:10%
and is one molecule
different from LSA,

00:04:09.800 --> 00:04:12.410 align:middle line:10%
or morning glory seeds, which
are used in Mesoamerica.

00:04:12.410 --> 00:04:13.370 align:middle line:90%
It's just one molecule.

00:04:13.370 --> 00:04:16.160 align:middle line:84%
Essentially, it's the same,
but it's made in a laboratory.

00:04:16.160 --> 00:04:18.620 align:middle line:84%
But on some level, if you
look at those hundreds,

00:04:18.620 --> 00:04:20.779 align:middle line:84%
if not thousands, of
years of disconnection

00:04:20.779 --> 00:04:23.360 align:middle line:84%
from the planet that we had
in the West and this rise

00:04:23.360 --> 00:04:25.340 align:middle line:84%
of hierarchy and
empire and culture,

00:04:25.340 --> 00:04:29.595 align:middle line:84%
which has created this battery
farm of global consciousness,

00:04:29.595 --> 00:04:32.870 align:middle line:84%
where we're all in these
systems, which are, perhaps,

00:04:32.870 --> 00:04:38.210 align:middle line:84%
not as nurturing or equitable
or loving as we would hope we

00:04:38.210 --> 00:04:40.370 align:middle line:84%
could be on the
planet, something

00:04:40.370 --> 00:04:43.250 align:middle line:84%
had to give, because energy
can't be created or destroyed.

00:04:43.250 --> 00:04:46.160 align:middle line:84%
And so a suppression of our
connection to our spirituality

00:04:46.160 --> 00:04:49.100 align:middle line:84%
within and our connection to
the planetary spirituality--

00:04:49.100 --> 00:04:50.377 align:middle line:90%
that has built up over time.

00:04:50.377 --> 00:04:51.710 align:middle line:90%
And I think now we're seeing it.

00:04:51.710 --> 00:04:54.380 align:middle line:84%
It came out in the '60s,
and it came out of a lab.

00:04:54.380 --> 00:04:57.020 align:middle line:84%
But essentially, it
was one generation

00:04:57.020 --> 00:04:59.770 align:middle line:84%
taking the brunt of the
psychic buildup of history

00:04:59.770 --> 00:05:02.515 align:middle line:84%
that had been suppressed of
this reconnection to spirit.

00:05:02.515 --> 00:05:04.640 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: There was a lot
of weed at the time, too,

00:05:04.640 --> 00:05:05.870 align:middle line:84%
and now we see
what has happened.

00:05:05.870 --> 00:05:07.730 align:middle line:84%
The progression of what's
happened with marijuana

00:05:07.730 --> 00:05:08.910 align:middle line:84%
is just one of
Earth's offerings.

00:05:08.910 --> 00:05:09.743 align:middle line:90%
>>RAZAM: Definitely.

00:05:09.743 --> 00:05:12.350 align:middle line:84%
So marijuana is actually
another sacramental plant used

00:05:12.350 --> 00:05:14.390 align:middle line:84%
by many different
cultures, but what

00:05:14.390 --> 00:05:17.630 align:middle line:84%
we've been discovering in modern
shamanic culture in the West

00:05:17.630 --> 00:05:20.720 align:middle line:84%
is that it's not just these
medicines or these psychedelics

00:05:20.720 --> 00:05:21.650 align:middle line:90%
or the substances.

00:05:21.650 --> 00:05:23.910 align:middle line:84%
It's the relationship
we have with them.

00:05:23.910 --> 00:05:26.630 align:middle line:84%
So in the West, because we
didn't have tribal guidance

00:05:26.630 --> 00:05:31.770 align:middle line:84%
or support to understand how
to take mind-altering things,

00:05:31.770 --> 00:05:33.180 align:middle line:90%
we had people crop up.

00:05:33.180 --> 00:05:34.950 align:middle line:10%
We had Ken Kesey.

00:05:34.950 --> 00:05:35.940 align:middle line:10%
We had Tim Leary.

00:05:35.940 --> 00:05:37.354 align:middle line:10%
We had Allen Ginsburg.

00:05:37.354 --> 00:05:39.270 align:middle line:10%
We had leaders in their
fields, who were like,

00:05:39.270 --> 00:05:41.040 align:middle line:10%
these substances,
the psychedelics,

00:05:41.040 --> 00:05:44.370 align:middle line:10%
LSD are profoundly altering
human consciousness,

00:05:44.370 --> 00:05:47.280 align:middle line:10%
and they have a capacity
to help us expand,

00:05:47.280 --> 00:05:51.450 align:middle line:10%
to reconnect, to really
move forward as a species.

00:05:51.450 --> 00:05:53.582 align:middle line:84%
But it created an equal
and opposite pressure

00:05:53.582 --> 00:05:55.540 align:middle line:84%
from the establishment,
because it was actually

00:05:55.540 --> 00:05:56.940 align:middle line:90%
a cultural revolution.

00:05:56.940 --> 00:06:00.060 align:middle line:84%
So it was a threat to the
powers that be in the paradigm.

00:06:00.060 --> 00:06:03.210 align:middle line:84%
But underneath that, what
I believe was happening

00:06:03.210 --> 00:06:07.560 align:middle line:84%
was this reclamation to spirit
and to expanded awareness that

00:06:07.560 --> 00:06:10.320 align:middle line:84%
had been building up over the
course of our disconnection

00:06:10.320 --> 00:06:12.090 align:middle line:90%
for hundreds of years.

00:06:12.090 --> 00:06:15.240 align:middle line:84%
And so it came through the
labs, and now the stepping stone

00:06:15.240 --> 00:06:17.430 align:middle line:84%
has been from the '60s
with the LSD revolution,

00:06:17.430 --> 00:06:19.000 align:middle line:90%
which opened their minds.

00:06:19.000 --> 00:06:21.442 align:middle line:84%
Then there was an '80s
revolution with ecstasy,

00:06:21.442 --> 00:06:22.650 align:middle line:90%
which actually was actually--

00:06:22.650 --> 00:06:24.150 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: And loads of cocaine--

00:06:24.150 --> 00:06:24.730 align:middle line:90%
>>RAZAM: Well--

00:06:24.730 --> 00:06:25.400 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: '80s and '90s.

00:06:25.400 --> 00:06:27.252 align:middle line:84%
>>RAZAM: There's
different [INAUDIBLE ]..

00:06:27.252 --> 00:06:28.710 align:middle line:84%
You know, I like
to say that they--

00:06:28.710 --> 00:06:29.751 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Crack, cocaine.

00:06:29.751 --> 00:06:31.650 align:middle line:84%
>>RAZAM: Well, they
say a culture gets

00:06:31.650 --> 00:06:32.900 align:middle line:90%
the politician it deserves.

00:06:32.900 --> 00:06:35.850 align:middle line:84%
Well, I think it also gets the
stimulants or the chemicals

00:06:35.850 --> 00:06:36.540 align:middle line:90%
or the sacraments that it needs.

00:06:36.540 --> 00:06:38.010 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Yeah, the drugs
that it deserves, yeah.

00:06:38.010 --> 00:06:40.470 align:middle line:84%
>>RAZAM: So we've mentioned
things like crack and cocaine

00:06:40.470 --> 00:06:43.320 align:middle line:84%
and the ice epidemic
around the world.

00:06:43.320 --> 00:06:46.530 align:middle line:84%
Lots of these substances
are politically motivated,

00:06:46.530 --> 00:06:47.957 align:middle line:84%
and as agendas of
social control,

00:06:47.957 --> 00:06:50.040 align:middle line:84%
has been really well-documented
in the drug wars--

00:06:50.040 --> 00:06:50.915 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Absolutely.

00:06:50.915 --> 00:06:53.080 align:middle line:84%
>>RAZAM: --where crack
cocaine and things like that

00:06:53.080 --> 00:06:56.740 align:middle line:84%
were saturated into
African-American neighborhoods

00:06:56.740 --> 00:06:57.540 align:middle line:90%
in the '70s.

00:06:57.540 --> 00:06:58.706 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Or Southeast Asia.

00:06:58.706 --> 00:07:01.440 align:middle line:84%
>>RAZAM: To destabilize the
community cultural structures.

00:07:01.440 --> 00:07:03.810 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: But then it was
taken on as the drug of choice

00:07:03.810 --> 00:07:05.379 align:middle line:84%
by upper income,
like Wall Street.

00:07:05.379 --> 00:07:07.920 align:middle line:84%
>>RAZAM: You know what you've
always got to ask is, cui bono?

00:07:07.920 --> 00:07:09.090 align:middle line:90%
Who profits?

00:07:09.090 --> 00:07:11.310 align:middle line:84%
Any culture that is
fair and equitable

00:07:11.310 --> 00:07:12.870 align:middle line:84%
and lives under
this understanding

00:07:12.870 --> 00:07:15.210 align:middle line:84%
that there is a freedom
of your own consciousness

00:07:15.210 --> 00:07:18.570 align:middle line:84%
and the whole American
revolution and Constitution,

00:07:18.570 --> 00:07:22.680 align:middle line:84%
and you have the right
to certain states

00:07:22.680 --> 00:07:25.710 align:middle line:84%
of being, certain inalienable
rights to freedom,

00:07:25.710 --> 00:07:28.770 align:middle line:84%
and that it should include
of consciousness itself,

00:07:28.770 --> 00:07:31.510 align:middle line:90%
it's not a legal thing.

00:07:31.510 --> 00:07:33.210 align:middle line:84%
It's more of a
cultural control thing.

00:07:33.210 --> 00:07:35.650 align:middle line:84%
Why do we get the drugs
we get when we get them?

00:07:35.650 --> 00:07:37.920 align:middle line:84%
So the cocaines
and the body drugs,

00:07:37.920 --> 00:07:40.560 align:middle line:90%
which keep us stimulated--

00:07:40.560 --> 00:07:43.030 align:middle line:84%
coffee, alcohol, cocaine,
things like that.

00:07:43.030 --> 00:07:43.830 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Exactly.

00:07:43.830 --> 00:07:46.246 align:middle line:84%
>>RAZAM: But why did they ban
marijuana for like 60 years?

00:07:46.246 --> 00:07:47.970 align:middle line:84%
Because not only
does it calm down,

00:07:47.970 --> 00:07:52.560 align:middle line:84%
and it's been proven to have
so many medical benefits,

00:07:52.560 --> 00:07:55.260 align:middle line:84%
but actually, it not
just makes you feel good,

00:07:55.260 --> 00:07:58.710 align:middle line:84%
but it relaxes the tension of
our culture and our stress.

00:07:58.710 --> 00:08:00.540 align:middle line:84%
In indigenous cultures,
where marijuana

00:08:00.540 --> 00:08:03.400 align:middle line:84%
has been used sacramentally,
it also, I believe,

00:08:03.400 --> 00:08:05.100 align:middle line:84%
has a plant spirit
attached to it.

00:08:05.100 --> 00:08:08.440 align:middle line:84%
So the danger, which I
see in Western culture,

00:08:08.440 --> 00:08:11.160 align:middle line:84%
is there's a permissibility
happening now for psychedelics

00:08:11.160 --> 00:08:13.140 align:middle line:84%
and certain stimulants
and drugs to be

00:08:13.140 --> 00:08:15.740 align:middle line:84%
legalized or de-classified
and decriminalized,

00:08:15.740 --> 00:08:17.340 align:middle line:90%
made recreational.

00:08:17.340 --> 00:08:18.570 align:middle line:90%
But what would that do to us?

00:08:18.570 --> 00:08:22.230 align:middle line:84%
Without the understanding
of ceremony,

00:08:22.230 --> 00:08:24.416 align:middle line:84%
of ritual, of right usage
of these substances--

00:08:24.416 --> 00:08:26.540 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Well, it's, for
example, in some circles,

00:08:26.540 --> 00:08:30.570 align:middle line:84%
it's stated that the new
move to legalize marijuana

00:08:30.570 --> 00:08:34.559 align:middle line:84%
across the country is taking
us into a brave new world

00:08:34.559 --> 00:08:36.370 align:middle line:90%
type of society and soma.

00:08:36.370 --> 00:08:37.460 align:middle line:90%
It's been called soma.

00:08:37.460 --> 00:08:39.418 align:middle line:84%
>>RAZAM: You may have
seen in the feeds there's

00:08:39.418 --> 00:08:41.700 align:middle line:84%
mock-up pictures of Monsanto
marijuana cigarettes.

00:08:41.700 --> 00:08:42.780 align:middle line:90%
That's where it could go, right?

00:08:42.780 --> 00:08:43.230 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: That's right.

00:08:43.230 --> 00:08:43.950 align:middle line:84%
>>RAZAM: But one
thing I want to say

00:08:43.950 --> 00:08:47.130 align:middle line:84%
about the '60s, the difference
in indigenous tribal cultures,

00:08:47.130 --> 00:08:51.760 align:middle line:84%
which in the West, we have a
sort of monoculture approach

00:08:51.760 --> 00:08:52.560 align:middle line:90%
to consciousness.

00:08:52.560 --> 00:08:54.480 align:middle line:84%
You have this level
of consciousness.

00:08:54.480 --> 00:08:55.484 align:middle line:90%
You go to work.

00:08:55.484 --> 00:08:56.400 align:middle line:90%
You do certain things.

00:08:56.400 --> 00:08:59.670 align:middle line:84%
You have some uppers and downers
to put brakes or accelerators

00:08:59.670 --> 00:09:02.100 align:middle line:84%
on consciousness,
and then you go home.

00:09:02.100 --> 00:09:04.770 align:middle line:90%
And you keep it on an even keel.

00:09:04.770 --> 00:09:06.270 align:middle line:84%
Indigenous cultures
around the world

00:09:06.270 --> 00:09:08.886 align:middle line:84%
understand a multiplicity
of consciousness states,

00:09:08.886 --> 00:09:10.510 align:middle line:84%
where there's waking,
there's dreaming,

00:09:10.510 --> 00:09:11.730 align:middle line:90%
there's altered states.

00:09:11.730 --> 00:09:14.610 align:middle line:84%
There's ceremony, which they go
into to connect with the planet

00:09:14.610 --> 00:09:16.170 align:middle line:90%
and other spirits.

00:09:16.170 --> 00:09:18.780 align:middle line:84%
And that's what I think is
coming back into the West,

00:09:18.780 --> 00:09:20.880 align:middle line:84%
because indigenous
cultures also have

00:09:20.880 --> 00:09:25.380 align:middle line:84%
a very firm understanding of
transitional times in our life

00:09:25.380 --> 00:09:26.850 align:middle line:90%
and of initiation.

00:09:26.850 --> 00:09:29.970 align:middle line:84%
So women have their
initiation with moon time

00:09:29.970 --> 00:09:33.420 align:middle line:84%
when they have-- the
menstrual cycle starts.

00:09:33.420 --> 00:09:35.430 align:middle line:84%
And it connects them to
the cycles of the moon

00:09:35.430 --> 00:09:37.650 align:middle line:84%
and to also their own
bodies and to other women.

00:09:37.650 --> 00:09:40.140 align:middle line:84%
And there's that
expansion of what it meant

00:09:40.140 --> 00:09:41.670 align:middle line:90%
to be a girl and to a woman.

00:09:41.670 --> 00:09:43.890 align:middle line:84%
With men, especially,
unless they

00:09:43.890 --> 00:09:46.650 align:middle line:84%
have specific men's
initiation ceremonies, which

00:09:46.650 --> 00:09:52.020 align:middle line:84%
indigenous cultures do,
men don't have that growth

00:09:52.020 --> 00:09:55.479 align:middle line:84%
understanding that they're
more than just young boys, who

00:09:55.479 --> 00:09:57.520 align:middle line:84%
are meant to stay on that
level of consciousness.

00:09:57.520 --> 00:10:00.960 align:middle line:84%
You have a duty to the tribe, a
duty to the women in the tribe,

00:10:00.960 --> 00:10:03.790 align:middle line:84%
and duty to the community
and a duty to the planet.

00:10:03.790 --> 00:10:07.800 align:middle line:84%
So these levels of intimacy
need to be actioned.

00:10:07.800 --> 00:10:12.180 align:middle line:84%
They need to be awakened in a
fully functional human being.

00:10:12.180 --> 00:10:14.370 align:middle line:84%
So indigenous cultures
have plant medicines

00:10:14.370 --> 00:10:18.900 align:middle line:84%
and certain initiation times to
bring people from teenagehood

00:10:18.900 --> 00:10:21.210 align:middle line:84%
into adulthood,
and to be an adult

00:10:21.210 --> 00:10:23.580 align:middle line:84%
and in many indigenous
cultures around the world

00:10:23.580 --> 00:10:26.970 align:middle line:84%
means to understand what
you're really embedded in.

00:10:26.970 --> 00:10:30.060 align:middle line:84%
And you're embedded in and not
separate from the earth, Mother

00:10:30.060 --> 00:10:32.910 align:middle line:84%
Gaia, we say in Western
sort of hippie speak.

00:10:32.910 --> 00:10:34.200 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:10:34.200 --> 00:10:36.290 align:middle line:84%
>>RAZAM: But it's like
to know that, then you

00:10:36.290 --> 00:10:37.450 align:middle line:90%
know right relationship.

00:10:37.450 --> 00:10:38.866 align:middle line:84%
And then you can
have relationship

00:10:38.866 --> 00:10:41.380 align:middle line:84%
with your peers, with your
community, with your tribe.

00:10:41.380 --> 00:10:44.630 align:middle line:84%
And it creates a much
more holistic culture

00:10:44.630 --> 00:10:47.790 align:middle line:84%
that can understand how plant
medicines like ayahuasca

00:10:47.790 --> 00:10:49.410 align:middle line:84%
and things like
that, how they can

00:10:49.410 --> 00:10:54.030 align:middle line:84%
be used as just one function
of an organic, holistic Gaian

00:10:54.030 --> 00:10:55.180 align:middle line:90%
society.

00:10:55.180 --> 00:10:57.750 align:middle line:84%
And I think that's
hopefully, potentially where

00:10:57.750 --> 00:10:58.750 align:middle line:90%
we're coming back into.

00:10:58.750 --> 00:11:02.130 align:middle line:84%
So the '60s, it was
a messy initiation,

00:11:02.130 --> 00:11:03.990 align:middle line:84%
but there wasn't
the elders, per se,

00:11:03.990 --> 00:11:06.420 align:middle line:84%
to give us the right
context of how to take it,

00:11:06.420 --> 00:11:08.490 align:middle line:84%
the right containers,
what to do with it.

00:11:08.490 --> 00:11:11.730 align:middle line:84%
You see, like it's the 50th
anniversary this year in June

00:11:11.730 --> 00:11:15.270 align:middle line:84%
of the summer of love, 1967,
and the great gatherings

00:11:15.270 --> 00:11:17.490 align:middle line:84%
of human beings in
Golden Gate Park.

00:11:17.490 --> 00:11:19.320 align:middle line:90%
And it's so funny.

00:11:19.320 --> 00:11:21.050 align:middle line:84%
I was in San Francisco
a few weeks ago,

00:11:21.050 --> 00:11:23.610 align:middle line:84%
but the local city council
was not giving them a permit

00:11:23.610 --> 00:11:27.000 align:middle line:84%
to have what they did as a
spontaneous demonstration

00:11:27.000 --> 00:11:29.440 align:middle line:84%
of the capacity of the human
experience in the '60s.

00:11:29.440 --> 00:11:30.240 align:middle line:90%
I don't know.

00:11:30.240 --> 00:11:31.610 align:middle line:84%
Rules and regulations
now can't do it.

00:11:31.610 --> 00:11:32.460 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Oh, no.

00:11:32.460 --> 00:11:33.310 align:middle line:90%
I'm from San Francisco.

00:11:33.310 --> 00:11:34.955 align:middle line:84%
I was born there, and it's
changed a lot that way.

00:11:34.955 --> 00:11:35.370 align:middle line:90%
>>RAZAM: Right.

00:11:35.370 --> 00:11:35.950 align:middle line:90%
It's funny, right?

00:11:35.950 --> 00:11:37.491 align:middle line:84%
Well, this is the
culture of control.

00:11:37.491 --> 00:11:41.484 align:middle line:84%
But essentially, it was this
huge generational initiation.

00:11:41.484 --> 00:11:43.400 align:middle line:84%
And people say, oh, what
happened to the '60s?

00:11:43.400 --> 00:11:43.980 align:middle line:90%
It failed.

00:11:43.980 --> 00:11:44.910 align:middle line:90%
I don't think it failed.

00:11:44.910 --> 00:11:45.570 align:middle line:90%
>>RAZAM: No, it didn't fail.

00:11:45.570 --> 00:11:46.390 align:middle line:90%
It planted seeds.

00:11:46.390 --> 00:11:47.190 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Exactly.

00:11:47.190 --> 00:11:50.580 align:middle line:84%
It planted-- what it was
meant to do was not form

00:11:50.580 --> 00:11:52.560 align:middle line:90%
the world in that generation.

00:11:52.560 --> 00:11:54.810 align:middle line:84%
It was meant to create
the seeds, which

00:11:54.810 --> 00:11:57.900 align:middle line:84%
would then be put into
the soil of culture

00:11:57.900 --> 00:12:00.240 align:middle line:84%
and would have these
changes that happened.

00:12:00.240 --> 00:12:03.390 align:middle line:84%
And then we've seen through
the '60s and the birth of what

00:12:03.390 --> 00:12:07.080 align:middle line:84%
it paralleled in the
psychedelic resurgence then,

00:12:07.080 --> 00:12:11.130 align:middle line:84%
it paralleled the start
of like the civil rights

00:12:11.130 --> 00:12:13.897 align:middle line:84%
movement, the women's movement,
the ecological movement,

00:12:13.897 --> 00:12:16.230 align:middle line:84%
and all these things weren't
necessarily caused by acid.

00:12:16.230 --> 00:12:20.205 align:middle line:84%
But it created conditions
of the time and the culture

00:12:20.205 --> 00:12:22.090 align:middle line:84%
that people could
think outside the box.

00:12:22.090 --> 00:12:23.687 align:middle line:90%
They were thinking holistically.

00:12:23.687 --> 00:12:25.770 align:middle line:84%
They were tuning into
different levels of reality.

00:12:25.770 --> 00:12:27.811 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: They were
rebelling against the effects

00:12:27.811 --> 00:12:30.120 align:middle line:84%
of industrialization and
modern industrialized

00:12:30.120 --> 00:12:32.720 align:middle line:84%
scientific materialism
type of world.

00:12:32.720 --> 00:12:34.710 align:middle line:84%
They had just started
rebelling against it,

00:12:34.710 --> 00:12:36.600 align:middle line:84%
because it didn't
feel good watching

00:12:36.600 --> 00:12:38.100 align:middle line:90%
the effects on their parents.

00:12:38.100 --> 00:12:38.900 align:middle line:90%
>>RAZAM: I know.

00:12:38.900 --> 00:12:43.644 align:middle line:84%
And you take a mind
expansion tool like LSD

00:12:43.644 --> 00:12:45.310 align:middle line:84%
or something like
ayahuasca or anything.

00:12:45.310 --> 00:12:47.760 align:middle line:84%
But as soon as you start
to re-sensitize and feel,

00:12:47.760 --> 00:12:50.550 align:middle line:84%
and then you look at your world
and see the horror of the way

00:12:50.550 --> 00:12:53.220 align:middle line:84%
things have been
constructed, how can you--

00:12:53.220 --> 00:12:54.660 align:middle line:90%
you can't turn back from that.

00:12:54.660 --> 00:12:58.800 align:middle line:84%
As a person who has
a conscience, when

00:12:58.800 --> 00:13:01.470 align:middle line:84%
you feel things once again,
then you have to act.

00:13:01.470 --> 00:13:03.030 align:middle line:84%
And that created a
shifting culture.

00:13:03.030 --> 00:13:04.405 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: It was
post-World War--

00:13:04.405 --> 00:13:06.360 align:middle line:84%
I mean it was
post-Vietnam War too.

00:13:06.360 --> 00:13:07.860 align:middle line:90%
That's not coincidental.

00:13:07.860 --> 00:13:11.310 align:middle line:84%
The drugs that were flooded into
this country from The Golden

00:13:11.310 --> 00:13:13.260 align:middle line:90%
Triangle was part of it.

00:13:13.260 --> 00:13:18.090 align:middle line:84%
The reaction to the
absurdity of war

00:13:18.090 --> 00:13:20.400 align:middle line:84%
through the lens of
that particular war

00:13:20.400 --> 00:13:21.720 align:middle line:90%
was our reaction to it.

00:13:21.720 --> 00:13:23.970 align:middle line:84%
Isn't it interesting--
problem, reaction, solution,

00:13:23.970 --> 00:13:24.930 align:middle line:90%
as they say?

00:13:24.930 --> 00:13:25.330 align:middle line:90%
>>RAZAM: Yeah.

00:13:25.330 --> 00:13:25.860 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right?

00:13:25.860 --> 00:13:27.770 align:middle line:84%
And that was part-- that's
part of what stimulated it.

00:13:27.770 --> 00:13:29.590 align:middle line:84%
>>RAZAM: Here's the interesting
thing and part of my thesis

00:13:29.590 --> 00:13:31.955 align:middle line:84%
that we're starting to
explore in the show, "Shamans

00:13:31.955 --> 00:13:34.920 align:middle line:84%
of the Global Village," is
that essentially, we've had,

00:13:34.920 --> 00:13:37.554 align:middle line:84%
as you've said, this
disconnect from the earth.

00:13:37.554 --> 00:13:39.720 align:middle line:84%
And we've had generations
in the West, where there's

00:13:39.720 --> 00:13:40.874 align:middle line:90%
been no plant medicines.

00:13:40.874 --> 00:13:43.290 align:middle line:84%
And then all of a sudden, we
have a psychedelic revolution

00:13:43.290 --> 00:13:44.292 align:middle line:90%
in the '60s.

00:13:44.292 --> 00:13:45.750 align:middle line:84%
Then we have the
ecstasy revolution

00:13:45.750 --> 00:13:47.730 align:middle line:84%
in the '80s, which
helped open the hearts.

00:13:47.730 --> 00:13:51.840 align:middle line:84%
And then a generation later, we
have all different age groups

00:13:51.840 --> 00:13:54.439 align:middle line:84%
like not just
recreational teenagers

00:13:54.439 --> 00:13:56.730 align:middle line:84%
that might have been like in
the '60s with the hippies.

00:13:56.730 --> 00:14:00.270 align:middle line:84%
But we have men, women of
all socioeconomic groups,

00:14:00.270 --> 00:14:02.970 align:middle line:84%
of all age groups going down
to the jungles of the Amazon

00:14:02.970 --> 00:14:05.610 align:middle line:84%
to discover the plant
medicine, ayahuasca,

00:14:05.610 --> 00:14:08.340 align:middle line:84%
and what that can do for people,
how that can help with healing.

00:14:08.340 --> 00:14:11.180 align:middle line:84%
But on a deeper level, how
people are then reweaving

00:14:11.180 --> 00:14:12.960 align:middle line:90%
and reconnecting to the earth.

00:14:12.960 --> 00:14:16.980 align:middle line:84%
And then I see this like
intergenerational cascade,

00:14:16.980 --> 00:14:19.140 align:middle line:84%
which is happening
from the '60s, opening

00:14:19.140 --> 00:14:21.570 align:middle line:84%
the mind, ecstasy in the
'80s opening the hearts,

00:14:21.570 --> 00:14:24.330 align:middle line:84%
and now ayahuasca helping
to reconnect to spirit.

00:14:24.330 --> 00:14:26.700 align:middle line:84%
And it doesn't seem like
there's any coincidence there.

00:14:26.700 --> 00:14:28.956 align:middle line:84%
It's like one had
to happen before we

00:14:28.956 --> 00:14:30.330 align:middle line:84%
could have the
next one happening

00:14:30.330 --> 00:14:30.990 align:middle line:90%
and the stepping stone.

00:14:30.990 --> 00:14:32.198 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah, that is true.

00:14:32.198 --> 00:14:35.637 align:middle line:84%
And at the same time, you have
this punctuation in between,

00:14:35.637 --> 00:14:36.720 align:middle line:90%
which is very interesting.

00:14:36.720 --> 00:14:38.130 align:middle line:90%
You just brought it up yourself.

00:14:38.130 --> 00:14:41.030 align:middle line:84%
Because I remember when this
happened in the early 1990s,

00:14:41.030 --> 00:14:45.240 align:middle line:84%
that's when, really, I think
Starbucks went public, OK?

00:14:45.240 --> 00:14:51.690 align:middle line:84%
So you had this infusion
of the two-person household

00:14:51.690 --> 00:14:53.430 align:middle line:90%
in terms of income, right?

00:14:53.430 --> 00:14:55.140 align:middle line:90%
You had much more stress.

00:14:55.140 --> 00:14:56.700 align:middle line:90%
You had the influx of credit.

00:14:56.700 --> 00:14:59.400 align:middle line:84%
That's when credit really
became very available to people,

00:14:59.400 --> 00:15:02.686 align:middle line:84%
so people started going
into this manic mood.

00:15:02.686 --> 00:15:04.560 align:middle line:84%
They were spending beyond
their needs because

00:15:04.560 --> 00:15:08.190 align:middle line:84%
of easy, free credit just
being pumped in like heroin

00:15:08.190 --> 00:15:09.151 align:middle line:90%
into society.

00:15:09.151 --> 00:15:10.650 align:middle line:84%
>>RAZAM: That's a
very good analogy.

00:15:10.650 --> 00:15:10.920 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:15:10.920 --> 00:15:11.880 align:middle line:84%
>>RAZAM: And that's
essentially what it was.

00:15:11.880 --> 00:15:12.680 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:15:12.680 --> 00:15:15.220 align:middle line:84%
And so now you have people
that are on a different type

00:15:15.220 --> 00:15:16.020 align:middle line:90%
of treadmill.

00:15:16.020 --> 00:15:17.580 align:middle line:90%
It's going a lot faster.

00:15:17.580 --> 00:15:20.280 align:middle line:84%
In order to keep up with it,
you needed the appropriate drugs

00:15:20.280 --> 00:15:21.900 align:middle line:90%
to keep you in that space.

00:15:21.900 --> 00:15:25.770 align:middle line:84%
So during that period of time,
the '90s and the early 2000s--

00:15:25.770 --> 00:15:28.620 align:middle line:84%
again, we were talking
about this-- huge use

00:15:28.620 --> 00:15:32.640 align:middle line:84%
of recreational, upper middle
class in particular, cocaine,

00:15:32.640 --> 00:15:34.650 align:middle line:84%
even down to high
school and middle school

00:15:34.650 --> 00:15:39.900 align:middle line:84%
levels in the more well-to-do
schools, and also, caffeine.

00:15:39.900 --> 00:15:42.930 align:middle line:84%
So cocktail hour from
my parents' generation

00:15:42.930 --> 00:15:46.370 align:middle line:84%
gave way to having an extra
shot of espresso or hit

00:15:46.370 --> 00:15:49.627 align:middle line:84%
of cocaine on the way home
at the end of the day.

00:15:49.627 --> 00:15:51.210 align:middle line:84%
So you're talking
about putting people

00:15:51.210 --> 00:15:54.870 align:middle line:84%
into a major
sympathetic overdrive

00:15:54.870 --> 00:15:57.000 align:middle line:90%
in the nervous system, right?

00:15:57.000 --> 00:15:58.500 align:middle line:84%
So how do you come
down from that?

00:15:58.500 --> 00:16:00.150 align:middle line:84%
>>RAZAM: Well, like culture
itself, that's not sustainable.

00:16:00.150 --> 00:16:01.191 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: What's that do?

00:16:01.191 --> 00:16:02.310 align:middle line:90%
It's unsustainable.

00:16:02.310 --> 00:16:03.180 align:middle line:90%
It's a manic ride.

00:16:03.180 --> 00:16:05.638 align:middle line:84%
>>RAZAM: For the global economy
to grow every three months,

00:16:05.638 --> 00:16:07.380 align:middle line:84%
every quarter more
than it was before,

00:16:07.380 --> 00:16:10.180 align:middle line:84%
drawing upon the resources of
the planet, which is finite,

00:16:10.180 --> 00:16:12.444 align:middle line:84%
whose ecological
systems are in, like,

00:16:12.444 --> 00:16:13.860 align:middle line:84%
crisis point because
of what we're

00:16:13.860 --> 00:16:15.720 align:middle line:84%
doing with,
essentially, capitalism

00:16:15.720 --> 00:16:18.480 align:middle line:84%
or late stage capitalism,
which then also affects us

00:16:18.480 --> 00:16:20.220 align:middle line:90%
on the micro level personally.

00:16:20.220 --> 00:16:22.350 align:middle line:84%
As you say, we're
adrenally focused.

00:16:22.350 --> 00:16:23.880 align:middle line:84%
Our drugs and our
consciousness are

00:16:23.880 --> 00:16:26.140 align:middle line:84%
sort of revolving
around that as well.

00:16:26.140 --> 00:16:27.672 align:middle line:84%
And it's a planetary
battery farm.

00:16:27.672 --> 00:16:28.630 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: It really is.

00:16:28.630 --> 00:16:29.930 align:middle line:90%
>>RAZAM: What is it producing?

00:16:29.930 --> 00:16:32.070 align:middle line:90%
Where is the happiness?

00:16:32.070 --> 00:16:34.590 align:middle line:90%
Where is the spirit?

00:16:34.590 --> 00:16:36.316 align:middle line:84%
Not only can it
not continue, it's

00:16:36.316 --> 00:16:38.940 align:middle line:84%
totally decaying and fragmenting
[INAUDIBLE] in our generation.

00:16:38.940 --> 00:16:40.606 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And it has
a long term effect.

00:16:40.606 --> 00:16:43.870 align:middle line:84%
You cannot burn the adrenals
at that rate and not have

00:16:43.870 --> 00:16:44.670 align:middle line:90%
a residue.

00:16:44.670 --> 00:16:47.790 align:middle line:84%
And one of the effects
is that it shuts off

00:16:47.790 --> 00:16:49.590 align:middle line:84%
connection from the
finer frequencies

00:16:49.590 --> 00:16:51.960 align:middle line:84%
and the finer strata
of consciousness,

00:16:51.960 --> 00:16:53.470 align:middle line:84%
because you're in
fight or flight.

00:16:53.470 --> 00:16:54.630 align:middle line:90%
You're in survival mode.

00:16:54.630 --> 00:16:57.129 align:middle line:84%
>>RAZAM: Imagine if-- I mean
this is the weird thing I think

00:16:57.129 --> 00:16:58.380 align:middle line:90%
is like--

00:16:58.380 --> 00:16:59.999 align:middle line:84%
in my experiences
of plant medicines,

00:16:59.999 --> 00:17:02.040 align:middle line:84%
one of the key things that
ayahuasca has shown me

00:17:02.040 --> 00:17:05.540 align:middle line:84%
isn't necessarily the
complete visionary component

00:17:05.540 --> 00:17:09.089 align:middle line:84%
and all this sort of like trippy
innerscape visionary stuff.

00:17:09.089 --> 00:17:14.460 align:middle line:84%
It's more this resensitization
to myself and to these feelings

00:17:14.460 --> 00:17:16.500 align:middle line:84%
of energy within myself
and these capacities

00:17:16.500 --> 00:17:19.282 align:middle line:84%
that the bluntness
of Western culture

00:17:19.282 --> 00:17:21.740 align:middle line:84%
and what we can bring to the
table when we turn up for work

00:17:21.740 --> 00:17:23.819 align:middle line:84%
or go to school or
engage with people

00:17:23.819 --> 00:17:25.787 align:middle line:84%
is a very narrow bandwidth
of the full spectrum

00:17:25.787 --> 00:17:26.745 align:middle line:90%
of human consciousness.

00:17:26.745 --> 00:17:27.480 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Oh, absolutely.

00:17:27.480 --> 00:17:28.740 align:middle line:84%
>>RAZAM: And when
I've experienced--

00:17:28.740 --> 00:17:29.400 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Intentionally so.

00:17:29.400 --> 00:17:29.640 align:middle line:90%
>>RAZAM: Yeah.

00:17:29.640 --> 00:17:31.473 align:middle line:84%
When [INAUDIBLE]
experiences resensitization

00:17:31.473 --> 00:17:34.950 align:middle line:84%
with plant medicines, it
reveals, it cleans out,

00:17:34.950 --> 00:17:39.180 align:middle line:84%
and it shows me more
capacity within myself.

00:17:39.180 --> 00:17:42.300 align:middle line:84%
And then in that innate
endogenous natural capacity,

00:17:42.300 --> 00:17:44.460 align:middle line:84%
this God-given
capacity, I feel I

00:17:44.460 --> 00:17:47.610 align:middle line:84%
can connect more to the planet
and to nature and to the earth

00:17:47.610 --> 00:17:50.850 align:middle line:84%
and the wind and the sun and
the feeling and the intuition,

00:17:50.850 --> 00:17:53.580 align:middle line:84%
and there's different levels
of consciousness, which we

00:17:53.580 --> 00:17:55.500 align:middle line:90%
have had as a species before.

00:17:55.500 --> 00:17:58.860 align:middle line:84%
But we've fallen into
history, into his story.

00:17:58.860 --> 00:18:00.450 align:middle line:84%
And it's only 10,000
or so years old,

00:18:00.450 --> 00:18:02.620 align:middle line:84%
but we've obviously had
hundreds of thousands,

00:18:02.620 --> 00:18:05.190 align:middle line:84%
if not millions of years
of life on the planet.

00:18:05.190 --> 00:18:07.260 align:middle line:84%
And where I'm from
in Australia, I

00:18:07.260 --> 00:18:08.850 align:middle line:84%
have been very
privileged to have

00:18:08.850 --> 00:18:12.300 align:middle line:84%
had some discussions
with indigenous mobs,

00:18:12.300 --> 00:18:14.040 align:middle line:90%
of Australian Aboriginals.

00:18:14.040 --> 00:18:18.990 align:middle line:84%
And essentially, they say the
dream time is coming back.

00:18:18.990 --> 00:18:22.020 align:middle line:84%
It's something that
is, essentially,

00:18:22.020 --> 00:18:23.560 align:middle line:90%
a season of consciousness.

00:18:23.560 --> 00:18:28.020 align:middle line:84%
And because they have 80,000
years or more of an oral record

00:18:28.020 --> 00:18:30.930 align:middle line:84%
of understanding their culture
and the different world

00:18:30.930 --> 00:18:33.270 align:middle line:84%
ages within that,
they understand

00:18:33.270 --> 00:18:35.460 align:middle line:90%
that times come and go.

00:18:35.460 --> 00:18:37.620 align:middle line:90%
Cultures come and go.

00:18:37.620 --> 00:18:39.720 align:middle line:84%
And there's like seasons
of consciousness.

00:18:39.720 --> 00:18:41.700 align:middle line:84%
And in my explorations
over years

00:18:41.700 --> 00:18:44.940 align:middle line:84%
as I've become a public
commentator on, I guess,

00:18:44.940 --> 00:18:47.190 align:middle line:84%
the psychedelic culture
and now shamanic culture

00:18:47.190 --> 00:18:50.710 align:middle line:84%
and the interplaying
relationship of both of those,

00:18:50.710 --> 00:18:53.730 align:middle line:84%
I see that there's these
different cultural maps that

00:18:53.730 --> 00:18:56.580 align:middle line:84%
have been left behind by many
different world cultures--

00:18:56.580 --> 00:18:59.550 align:middle line:84%
the Inca, the Maya,
the Aztecs, the Dogon,

00:18:59.550 --> 00:19:02.070 align:middle line:84%
the Australian Aboriginals--
where they understand

00:19:02.070 --> 00:19:04.380 align:middle line:84%
that there's seasons
of time a world ages

00:19:04.380 --> 00:19:06.090 align:middle line:90%
according to their calendricals.

00:19:06.090 --> 00:19:09.210 align:middle line:84%
And my shorthand for it is it's
almost as if we've fallen down

00:19:09.210 --> 00:19:12.940 align:middle line:84%
into like one bar, like on
our phone of getting signal,

00:19:12.940 --> 00:19:15.190 align:middle line:84%
and that's been the last
2,000 years or so of history.

00:19:15.190 --> 00:19:16.660 align:middle line:90%
We've had one bar signal.

00:19:16.660 --> 00:19:18.310 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Yeah, well, we've
been under total patriarchy

00:19:18.310 --> 00:19:18.910 align:middle line:90%
since then, for one.

00:19:18.910 --> 00:19:20.220 align:middle line:84%
>>RAZAM: I know, and I don't
think it's a coincidence.

00:19:20.220 --> 00:19:22.620 align:middle line:84%
But now we're coming back
up in the cycles of time,

00:19:22.620 --> 00:19:26.010 align:middle line:84%
and we've just-- the whole 2012
thing, which in the Mayans,

00:19:26.010 --> 00:19:30.120 align:middle line:84%
in their galactic
calendar, essentially,

00:19:30.120 --> 00:19:31.370 align:middle line:90%
were saying there wasn't 2012.

00:19:31.370 --> 00:19:34.150 align:middle line:84%
To them, that's just a Western
conceit of our calendar.

00:19:34.150 --> 00:19:38.550 align:middle line:90%
But to them, it was 0.0.0.0.0.

00:19:38.550 --> 00:19:40.860 align:middle line:84%
It was basically
the full culmination

00:19:40.860 --> 00:19:45.445 align:middle line:84%
of 26,000 years of their large
orbit of our solar system

00:19:45.445 --> 00:19:46.245 align:middle line:90%
around the galaxy.

00:19:46.245 --> 00:19:46.650 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: The baktun.

00:19:46.650 --> 00:19:47.733 align:middle line:90%
>>RAZAM: The baktun, yeah.

00:19:47.733 --> 00:19:50.130 align:middle line:84%
And we are now facing galactic
center, and at the center

00:19:50.130 --> 00:19:52.530 align:middle line:84%
of the galaxy, or
they believed was

00:19:52.530 --> 00:19:55.270 align:middle line:84%
what they called Hunab Ku,
the womb of the great mother,

00:19:55.270 --> 00:19:59.986 align:middle line:84%
which is a beautiful
linguistical explanation

00:19:59.986 --> 00:20:02.360 align:middle line:84%
for the energetics of what's
at the center of the galaxy.

00:20:02.360 --> 00:20:03.950 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: We are guests
on this great entity.

00:20:03.950 --> 00:20:04.860 align:middle line:90%
>>RAZAM: Yeah.

00:20:04.860 --> 00:20:07.230 align:middle line:84%
In 2002, NASA
discovered and confirmed

00:20:07.230 --> 00:20:09.550 align:middle line:84%
there's a black hole at
the center of the galaxy.

00:20:09.550 --> 00:20:11.610 align:middle line:84%
And I'm sure some of
the commentators who

00:20:11.610 --> 00:20:15.000 align:middle line:84%
have been working with Gaia,
the astrophysicists might say,

00:20:15.000 --> 00:20:18.069 align:middle line:84%
there's been so many beautiful
understandings in recent years

00:20:18.069 --> 00:20:19.610 align:middle line:84%
with astrophysics
and understanding--

00:20:19.610 --> 00:20:21.110 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Black
holes not understood

00:20:21.110 --> 00:20:22.280 align:middle line:90%
as it was before, yeah.

00:20:22.280 --> 00:20:23.080 align:middle line:90%
It's a plenum.

00:20:23.080 --> 00:20:24.180 align:middle line:84%
>>RAZAM: Yeah, so the
majority of things

00:20:24.180 --> 00:20:25.600 align:middle line:84%
go and get sucked
into a black hole.

00:20:25.600 --> 00:20:27.360 align:middle line:84%
But around the event
horizon, it builds up

00:20:27.360 --> 00:20:29.800 align:middle line:84%
this charge of energy,
which it spits off

00:20:29.800 --> 00:20:31.990 align:middle line:84%
into plasma-wide
jets, galaxies wide,

00:20:31.990 --> 00:20:35.770 align:middle line:84%
and ignites space dust and
different components out there.

00:20:35.770 --> 00:20:39.040 align:middle line:84%
And birth stars, like they think
that the whole cyclic component

00:20:39.040 --> 00:20:44.200 align:middle line:84%
of how suns are born is from
the energetic contribution

00:20:44.200 --> 00:20:45.375 align:middle line:90%
of black holes.

00:20:45.375 --> 00:20:47.916 align:middle line:84%
So it's like the Maya were sort
of right that they do birth--

00:20:47.916 --> 00:20:49.220 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Yeah,
it's wrongly termed.

00:20:49.220 --> 00:20:49.730 align:middle line:90%
>>RAZAM: Yeah.

00:20:49.730 --> 00:20:50.890 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: That's
what they discovered.

00:20:50.890 --> 00:20:52.510 align:middle line:84%
I mean, one of the
physicists I really

00:20:52.510 --> 00:20:55.270 align:middle line:84%
enjoyed about 15 years ago,
a man named Mark Cummings,

00:20:55.270 --> 00:20:58.330 align:middle line:84%
called it the black plenum,
because it's actually

00:20:58.330 --> 00:20:59.520 align:middle line:90%
the birth center.

00:20:59.520 --> 00:21:02.320 align:middle line:84%
It's where consciousness
meets with, you might say,

00:21:02.320 --> 00:21:06.715 align:middle line:84%
prima materia to start
bringing into manifestation

00:21:06.715 --> 00:21:08.170 align:middle line:84%
whatever the
dreamer is dreaming,

00:21:08.170 --> 00:21:10.260 align:middle line:84%
whether they're dreaming
of a new galaxy or cosmos

00:21:10.260 --> 00:21:11.060 align:middle line:90%
or whatever.

00:21:11.060 --> 00:21:12.670 align:middle line:84%
>>RAZAM: That is exactly
what my understanding

00:21:12.670 --> 00:21:13.360 align:middle line:90%
of what the Mayans said.

00:21:13.360 --> 00:21:15.030 align:middle line:84%
As well as being the
womb of the great mother,

00:21:15.030 --> 00:21:16.488 align:middle line:84%
it was the source
of consciousness.

00:21:16.488 --> 00:21:17.302 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:21:17.302 --> 00:21:18.260 align:middle line:90%
>>RAZAM: In our galaxy.

00:21:18.260 --> 00:21:21.670 align:middle line:84%
So in our world age,
just astronomically,

00:21:21.670 --> 00:21:23.629 align:middle line:84%
we are now pointing
at galactic center.

00:21:23.629 --> 00:21:25.420 align:middle line:84%
And if that is the
source of consciousness,

00:21:25.420 --> 00:21:27.610 align:middle line:84%
well, we're going up
to four bar signal.

00:21:27.610 --> 00:21:29.256 align:middle line:84%
And so I think
everyone's feeling it.

00:21:29.256 --> 00:21:30.880 align:middle line:84%
And it's not just
about plant medicines

00:21:30.880 --> 00:21:33.010 align:middle line:90%
and shamanism and psychedelics.

00:21:33.010 --> 00:21:35.480 align:middle line:84%
There's this increased
interest in Western culture

00:21:35.480 --> 00:21:37.310 align:middle line:84%
in breath work, in
yoga, in meditation.

00:21:37.310 --> 00:21:39.518 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Well, this is
where I was just going to go,

00:21:39.518 --> 00:21:41.290 align:middle line:84%
because in the '60s,
simultaneously,

00:21:41.290 --> 00:21:43.960 align:middle line:84%
it wasn't just LSD
that was happening

00:21:43.960 --> 00:21:46.326 align:middle line:84%
or pot that was
happening or beginning.

00:21:46.326 --> 00:21:47.700 align:middle line:84%
That was really
more in the '70s.

00:21:47.700 --> 00:21:48.860 align:middle line:84%
>>RAZAM: Eastern
mysticism came in.

00:21:48.860 --> 00:21:49.830 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: TM came in.

00:21:49.830 --> 00:21:50.830 align:middle line:90%
>>RAZAM: That's right.

00:21:50.830 --> 00:21:52.371 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And I've
noticed something,

00:21:52.371 --> 00:21:54.610 align:middle line:84%
and it may have-- it may
be quite different now.

00:21:54.610 --> 00:21:55.630 align:middle line:90%
You may notice this.

00:21:55.630 --> 00:21:58.390 align:middle line:84%
Because of the phenomena we are
talking about a little bit ago

00:21:58.390 --> 00:22:01.056 align:middle line:84%
that people are on
adrenal overload, burnout,

00:22:01.056 --> 00:22:03.430 align:middle line:84%
they've cut off access to
their higher part, their higher

00:22:03.430 --> 00:22:05.230 align:middle line:84%
conversation, by and
large, as a result

00:22:05.230 --> 00:22:08.849 align:middle line:84%
of being under perpetual
stress, which will cut it off.

00:22:08.849 --> 00:22:11.140 align:middle line:84%
And they're now seeking things
that will help open them

00:22:11.140 --> 00:22:14.740 align:middle line:84%
back into that connection
with higher self, really.

00:22:14.740 --> 00:22:17.620 align:middle line:84%
As a result of that, people
kind of split to different ways,

00:22:17.620 --> 00:22:20.797 align:middle line:84%
run to different houses of
how they want to get back

00:22:20.797 --> 00:22:21.880 align:middle line:90%
into connection with self.

00:22:21.880 --> 00:22:26.500 align:middle line:84%
But what I noticed is
that, generally speaking,

00:22:26.500 --> 00:22:31.960 align:middle line:84%
you had more women that were
attending the breath work,

00:22:31.960 --> 00:22:33.610 align:middle line:90%
TM, and so forth.

00:22:33.610 --> 00:22:36.190 align:middle line:84%
And you had more
men that were going

00:22:36.190 --> 00:22:39.170 align:middle line:84%
the route of the
hallucinogens, by and large.

00:22:39.170 --> 00:22:40.420 align:middle line:90%
It was very much--

00:22:40.420 --> 00:22:41.826 align:middle line:90%
it's very interesting.

00:22:41.826 --> 00:22:42.700 align:middle line:90%
Look at that, though.

00:22:42.700 --> 00:22:45.100 align:middle line:84%
I mean if you're looking
at right, left brain,

00:22:45.100 --> 00:22:47.940 align:middle line:84%
dominant fun-- only dominant
function in a given time frame,

00:22:47.940 --> 00:22:50.090 align:middle line:90%
and we can switch.

00:22:50.090 --> 00:22:52.750 align:middle line:84%
But if you're looking
at left brain logic,

00:22:52.750 --> 00:22:55.090 align:middle line:84%
the way boys and
men have societally

00:22:55.090 --> 00:22:56.980 align:middle line:84%
been trained in
the Western world,

00:22:56.980 --> 00:22:58.900 align:middle line:90%
very clear analytical thinking.

00:22:58.900 --> 00:23:01.660 align:middle line:84%
Girls-- oh, you're going to be a
mother, whatever in times past.

00:23:01.660 --> 00:23:05.170 align:middle line:84%
But also, this more
permission to explore

00:23:05.170 --> 00:23:09.460 align:middle line:84%
all of the more artistic side
of our capabilities and such,

00:23:09.460 --> 00:23:12.460 align:middle line:84%
which men are often shut
down earlier in life on.

00:23:12.460 --> 00:23:13.330 align:middle line:90%
It's interesting.

00:23:13.330 --> 00:23:15.940 align:middle line:84%
Those two different capacities
chose two different paths

00:23:15.940 --> 00:23:18.070 align:middle line:90%
to try to access self again.

00:23:18.070 --> 00:23:19.082 align:middle line:90%
>>RAZAM: It is.

00:23:19.082 --> 00:23:21.866 align:middle line:84%
And holistically, everything's
all one in that whole system.

00:23:21.866 --> 00:23:23.740 align:middle line:84%
If you look at culture
as a whole system, all

00:23:23.740 --> 00:23:24.400 align:middle line:90%
the different species--

00:23:24.400 --> 00:23:25.570 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: But we're
out of balance.

00:23:25.570 --> 00:23:27.028 align:middle line:84%
>>RAZAM: But we
are out of balance,

00:23:27.028 --> 00:23:30.070 align:middle line:84%
and as we see in 2,000
years or more of patriarchy,

00:23:30.070 --> 00:23:32.500 align:middle line:84%
there's been this very
energetic around it,

00:23:32.500 --> 00:23:34.600 align:middle line:84%
which has accentuated
those adrenals

00:23:34.600 --> 00:23:36.680 align:middle line:84%
and those outward
manifesting things.

00:23:36.680 --> 00:23:39.850 align:middle line:84%
I think they say the unification
of the spiritual warrior

00:23:39.850 --> 00:23:44.670 align:middle line:84%
is potentially this inward
yin connection to source,

00:23:44.670 --> 00:23:47.350 align:middle line:84%
a connection to the
subtleties and feeling

00:23:47.350 --> 00:23:51.550 align:middle line:84%
with the outward projection of
energy and the worry in this,

00:23:51.550 --> 00:23:52.530 align:middle line:90%
potentially, male.

00:23:52.530 --> 00:23:54.640 align:middle line:84%
And of course, those
things can counterplay,

00:23:54.640 --> 00:23:56.950 align:middle line:84%
and we don't want to get
gendered and just rigid

00:23:56.950 --> 00:23:58.850 align:middle line:84%
in saying, you have
to be this or that.

00:23:58.850 --> 00:24:01.429 align:middle line:84%
But there is a polarity in life
and in nature and in energy.

00:24:01.429 --> 00:24:02.470 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: And everything.

00:24:02.470 --> 00:24:04.954 align:middle line:84%
>>RAZAM: Many, many
different aspects of reality.

00:24:04.954 --> 00:24:07.120 align:middle line:84%
But it's interesting, because
I guess if you go back

00:24:07.120 --> 00:24:10.042 align:middle line:84%
to the '60s, I would
say I mean generally,

00:24:10.042 --> 00:24:11.500 align:middle line:84%
from what I
understand, there was--

00:24:11.500 --> 00:24:12.640 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Everybody smoked pot.

00:24:12.640 --> 00:24:13.780 align:middle line:90%
That was gender neutral.

00:24:13.780 --> 00:24:15.821 align:middle line:84%
>>RAZAM: Everybody smoked
pot, but there was also

00:24:15.821 --> 00:24:18.670 align:middle line:84%
maybe more of a cohesion
of it wasn't just

00:24:18.670 --> 00:24:20.270 align:middle line:90%
men doing psychedelics per se.

00:24:20.270 --> 00:24:22.960 align:middle line:84%
But in general, in the culture
in the last few decades,

00:24:22.960 --> 00:24:23.760 align:middle line:90%
you're right.

00:24:23.760 --> 00:24:25.840 align:middle line:84%
It does seem like
there's been a very top

00:24:25.840 --> 00:24:27.320 align:middle line:90%
heavy masculine influence in--

00:24:27.320 --> 00:24:27.800 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Toward ayahuasca.

00:24:27.800 --> 00:24:30.220 align:middle line:84%
>>RAZAM: --exploring that
potential with psychedelics,

00:24:30.220 --> 00:24:32.020 align:middle line:84%
essentially, because
they went underground.

00:24:32.020 --> 00:24:33.610 align:middle line:84%
But I know there's
been a lot of work

00:24:33.610 --> 00:24:37.690 align:middle line:84%
in the community, psychedelic,
and now shamanic community,

00:24:37.690 --> 00:24:40.930 align:middle line:84%
who, not to balance it out,
but women stepping forward

00:24:40.930 --> 00:24:43.600 align:middle line:84%
and maybe being overshadowed
by the masculinity,

00:24:43.600 --> 00:24:45.220 align:middle line:84%
even in psychedelic
culture, which

00:24:45.220 --> 00:24:49.150 align:middle line:84%
is meant to be mind manifesting
and about expansion, but still

00:24:49.150 --> 00:24:51.460 align:middle line:84%
maybe had some patriarchal
value systems attached

00:24:51.460 --> 00:24:54.834 align:middle line:84%
to it within the culture,
within Western culture as it--

00:24:54.834 --> 00:24:56.500 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Yeah, what
I've seen, though--

00:24:56.500 --> 00:24:58.291 align:middle line:84%
interesting, because
I told you off camera,

00:24:58.291 --> 00:25:00.880 align:middle line:84%
I can't take ayahuasca, because
I can't get in that position

00:25:00.880 --> 00:25:01.680 align:middle line:90%
physically.

00:25:01.680 --> 00:25:03.190 align:middle line:90%
I have a weird wiring system.

00:25:03.190 --> 00:25:05.650 align:middle line:84%
But the women I know
who have done it,

00:25:05.650 --> 00:25:09.460 align:middle line:84%
they never seem to have brought
back the same experience

00:25:09.460 --> 00:25:11.440 align:middle line:84%
that all the men
that I know that

00:25:11.440 --> 00:25:12.860 align:middle line:90%
took it seem to bring back.

00:25:12.860 --> 00:25:14.110 align:middle line:90%
>>RAZAM: Well, it's different.

00:25:14.110 --> 00:25:15.570 align:middle line:90%
It can be pretty subjective.

00:25:15.570 --> 00:25:17.699 align:middle line:84%
We could be getting into
rocky territory here.

00:25:17.699 --> 00:25:19.240 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: It's OK,
because it doesn't

00:25:19.240 --> 00:25:20.730 align:middle line:90%
have to be politically correct.

00:25:20.730 --> 00:25:21.919 align:middle line:90%
It's just an observation.

00:25:21.919 --> 00:25:24.460 align:middle line:84%
>>RAZAM: There's a bridge that's
been developing between what

00:25:24.460 --> 00:25:27.660 align:middle line:84%
we consider psychedelic culture,
and as we understand from '60s

00:25:27.660 --> 00:25:31.110 align:middle line:84%
on, psychedelics was the
term that was coined.

00:25:31.110 --> 00:25:33.180 align:middle line:84%
It means to mind
manifesting from psyche,

00:25:33.180 --> 00:25:35.040 align:middle line:90%
the Greek goddess of the mind.

00:25:35.040 --> 00:25:37.410 align:middle line:84%
And that was essentially
the man-made chemicals.

00:25:37.410 --> 00:25:39.600 align:middle line:84%
So in the '80s, they
coined this term entheogen,

00:25:39.600 --> 00:25:42.060 align:middle line:84%
which is from the Greek, to
invoke the divine within.

00:25:42.060 --> 00:25:44.580 align:middle line:84%
And it was not necessarily,
but it originally

00:25:44.580 --> 00:25:46.710 align:middle line:84%
was sort of put
around academically

00:25:46.710 --> 00:25:49.710 align:middle line:84%
to get over the stigma of the
'60s and the psychedelics.

00:25:49.710 --> 00:25:51.510 align:middle line:84%
But there's still
been a resurgence

00:25:51.510 --> 00:25:54.510 align:middle line:84%
in psychedelic culture and
usage and organizations

00:25:54.510 --> 00:25:57.300 align:middle line:84%
like MAPS, the Multidisciplinary
Association of Psychedelic

00:25:57.300 --> 00:26:00.870 align:middle line:84%
Studies, has been working
for the last 20 or 30 years

00:26:00.870 --> 00:26:03.270 align:middle line:84%
to bring back and to lobby
the FDA and the government

00:26:03.270 --> 00:26:06.540 align:middle line:84%
to work with these substances
in a medicinal way,

00:26:06.540 --> 00:26:07.797 align:middle line:90%
in a medical way.

00:26:07.797 --> 00:26:09.630 align:middle line:84%
And there were so many
studies done with LSD

00:26:09.630 --> 00:26:12.270 align:middle line:84%
in the '60s that
had amazing results

00:26:12.270 --> 00:26:16.950 align:middle line:84%
to help with recidivism
and habitual behaviors

00:26:16.950 --> 00:26:19.210 align:middle line:90%
and helping people in therapy.

00:26:19.210 --> 00:26:22.560 align:middle line:84%
There was the Good
Friday experiments

00:26:22.560 --> 00:26:25.110 align:middle line:84%
at John Hopkins that
worked on divinity students

00:26:25.110 --> 00:26:28.950 align:middle line:84%
in the '60s with psilocybin
from the magic mushrooms.

00:26:28.950 --> 00:26:31.800 align:middle line:84%
And it engendered a
mystical response in people

00:26:31.800 --> 00:26:35.220 align:middle line:84%
that, to this day, the placebo
effects from one group,

00:26:35.220 --> 00:26:38.390 align:middle line:84%
and the ones who had the
active dose say that--

00:26:38.390 --> 00:26:42.240 align:middle line:84%
and there were [? divinity ?]
students to be priests.

00:26:42.240 --> 00:26:43.980 align:middle line:84%
They said it was
still the one or two

00:26:43.980 --> 00:26:47.724 align:middle line:84%
most single peak experience of
their lives, that they had to--

00:26:47.724 --> 00:26:48.890 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: They were priests.

00:26:48.890 --> 00:26:49.040 align:middle line:90%
>>RAZAM: Yeah.

00:26:49.040 --> 00:26:49.795 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: They were all male.

00:26:49.795 --> 00:26:51.460 align:middle line:84%
>>RAZAM: They were engendered,
and they were all male.

00:26:51.460 --> 00:26:52.585 align:middle line:90%
That's what I'm getting to.

00:26:52.585 --> 00:26:53.580 align:middle line:90%
So there was that.

00:26:53.580 --> 00:26:55.950 align:middle line:84%
They replicated those
tests in the naughts

00:26:55.950 --> 00:26:57.930 align:middle line:84%
and had very similar
follow-up effects.

00:26:57.930 --> 00:26:59.400 align:middle line:84%
But the psychedelic
culture is now

00:26:59.400 --> 00:27:03.390 align:middle line:84%
bridged into shamanic
culture, and they coexist,

00:27:03.390 --> 00:27:06.810 align:middle line:84%
and to some degree, psychedelics
are still more looking

00:27:06.810 --> 00:27:10.200 align:middle line:90%
at MDMA, LSD, things like that.

00:27:10.200 --> 00:27:12.540 align:middle line:84%
And maybe in some
of the FDA tests

00:27:12.540 --> 00:27:14.160 align:middle line:84%
and the organizations
like MAPS, they

00:27:14.160 --> 00:27:15.785 align:middle line:84%
might still call them
all psychedelics.

00:27:15.785 --> 00:27:17.400 align:middle line:84%
But since the '90s
or so, there's

00:27:17.400 --> 00:27:20.730 align:middle line:84%
been more people going down
to indigenous cultures,

00:27:20.730 --> 00:27:23.090 align:middle line:84%
experimenting, or exploring
the potentials of things

00:27:23.090 --> 00:27:23.890 align:middle line:90%
like ayahuasca.

00:27:23.890 --> 00:27:26.640 align:middle line:84%
There's many, many
different plant entheogens.

00:27:26.640 --> 00:27:28.920 align:middle line:84%
There's psilocybin
magic mushrooms,

00:27:28.920 --> 00:27:33.090 align:middle line:84%
which have been caretaken by
the Mazatec cultures of Mexico.

00:27:33.090 --> 00:27:35.870 align:middle line:10%
Maria Sabina, who was
the very, very famous--

00:27:35.870 --> 00:27:37.590 align:middle line:10%
I think she's like
the Virgin Mary

00:27:37.590 --> 00:27:41.610 align:middle line:10%
of the psychedelic culture,
because in 1955, Gordon Wasson,

00:27:41.610 --> 00:27:44.430 align:middle line:10%
who was an investment
banker with one

00:27:44.430 --> 00:27:48.550 align:middle line:10%
of the big, big firms, Stanley?

00:27:48.550 --> 00:27:49.350 align:middle line:90%
Stanley?

00:27:49.350 --> 00:27:49.910 align:middle line:90%
Morgan Stanley.

00:27:49.910 --> 00:27:51.118 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Oh, Morgan Stanley.

00:27:51.118 --> 00:27:53.640 align:middle line:84%
>>RAZAM: He was like the vice
president of Morgan Stanley.

00:27:53.640 --> 00:27:55.920 align:middle line:84%
His wife was Russian,
and she was into--

00:27:55.920 --> 00:27:58.600 align:middle line:84%
she was a mycologist and
into mushrooms in general.

00:27:58.600 --> 00:28:01.320 align:middle line:84%
He was looking for
the origin of the soma

00:28:01.320 --> 00:28:05.520 align:middle line:84%
to be used in Greek culture
with the Rites of Eleusis.

00:28:05.520 --> 00:28:07.710 align:middle line:84%
So for 2,000 years
in Greek culture,

00:28:07.710 --> 00:28:09.810 align:middle line:84%
I mean one of the best
eons of modern democracy

00:28:09.810 --> 00:28:13.080 align:middle line:84%
and what we see is that we've
taken so much of modern culture

00:28:13.080 --> 00:28:15.900 align:middle line:84%
from in the West, Roman
and Greek culture.

00:28:15.900 --> 00:28:19.890 align:middle line:84%
They had a psychedelic
or entheogenic sacrament,

00:28:19.890 --> 00:28:21.960 align:middle line:84%
which they called
the kykeon, which

00:28:21.960 --> 00:28:23.599 align:middle line:90%
was an initiatory experience.

00:28:23.599 --> 00:28:25.140 align:middle line:84%
Mainly, they only
did it once, but it

00:28:25.140 --> 00:28:28.230 align:middle line:84%
was open to slaves, men,
and women across the board,

00:28:28.230 --> 00:28:30.120 align:middle line:84%
and it was something
which initiated them

00:28:30.120 --> 00:28:33.410 align:middle line:84%
into the understanding of
who and what they really are,

00:28:33.410 --> 00:28:35.430 align:middle line:84%
that initiation we were
talking about before.

00:28:35.430 --> 00:28:37.160 align:middle line:84%
And that was the
basis of what kept

00:28:37.160 --> 00:28:39.810 align:middle line:84%
Greek culture stable for so
long, and it's documented.

00:28:39.810 --> 00:28:41.650 align:middle line:90%
It's in the history books.

00:28:41.650 --> 00:28:42.650 align:middle line:90%
You can understand that.

00:28:42.650 --> 00:28:44.460 align:middle line:84%
So Gordon Wasson was
looking for something

00:28:44.460 --> 00:28:46.980 align:middle line:84%
like that or the soma,
which is in the Rigveda

00:28:46.980 --> 00:28:48.060 align:middle line:90%
and the Indian books.

00:28:48.060 --> 00:28:49.500 align:middle line:84%
He was looking for
something which

00:28:49.500 --> 00:28:52.740 align:middle line:84%
he thought was the mushroom
and could help understand

00:28:52.740 --> 00:28:55.590 align:middle line:84%
consciousness and these other
cultures that had come before.

00:28:55.590 --> 00:28:57.975 align:middle line:84%
He went down to Mexico
and met Maria Sabina,

00:28:57.975 --> 00:29:01.200 align:middle line:84%
and she introduced him to a
ceremony-- again, not just

00:29:01.200 --> 00:29:04.800 align:middle line:84%
the substance itself, but
the lineage and the idea

00:29:04.800 --> 00:29:06.780 align:middle line:90%
that you do these for healing.

00:29:06.780 --> 00:29:09.300 align:middle line:10%
And she talked to the spirits
in the mushrooms, not just

00:29:09.300 --> 00:29:12.420 align:middle line:10%
the substance itself and
the neurochemical effect,

00:29:12.420 --> 00:29:15.734 align:middle line:10%
but teaching the relationship
that this had a spirit in it.

00:29:15.734 --> 00:29:18.150 align:middle line:84%
She called it the ninos, the
little children, the mushroom

00:29:18.150 --> 00:29:19.110 align:middle line:90%
spirits.

00:29:19.110 --> 00:29:21.476 align:middle line:84%
Gordon Wasson and, of
course, unfortunately,

00:29:21.476 --> 00:29:23.100 align:middle line:84%
the history books
have since proven out

00:29:23.100 --> 00:29:26.820 align:middle line:84%
the CIA were funding his trips
down there looking for a truth

00:29:26.820 --> 00:29:28.960 align:middle line:84%
serum, working with LSD
throughout the '40s,

00:29:28.960 --> 00:29:33.060 align:middle line:84%
'50s, '60s, '70s, and
potentially, even onwards.

00:29:33.060 --> 00:29:35.460 align:middle line:84%
But the magic mushroom
came back into the West,

00:29:35.460 --> 00:29:39.270 align:middle line:84%
and that was on the front cover
of "Life" magazine in 1957.

00:29:39.270 --> 00:29:43.050 align:middle line:84%
And that, basically, started
the psychedelic revolution,

00:29:43.050 --> 00:29:47.280 align:middle line:84%
because then Timothy Leary
tried magic mushrooms in 1960,

00:29:47.280 --> 00:29:50.580 align:middle line:84%
and Richard [? Baron ?],, who
got him onto it from Harvard,

00:29:50.580 --> 00:29:52.770 align:middle line:84%
and they started working
with the magic mushrooms.

00:29:52.770 --> 00:29:55.080 align:middle line:84%
Of course, within two
years, all the LSD people

00:29:55.080 --> 00:29:57.270 align:middle line:84%
started to say, well, if
you like magic mushrooms,

00:29:57.270 --> 00:29:58.770 align:middle line:90%
why don't we look at LSD?

00:29:58.770 --> 00:30:01.230 align:middle line:84%
Timothy Leary started
working with LSD.

00:30:01.230 --> 00:30:03.760 align:middle line:84%
Other people in the culture
started all working with LSD

00:30:03.760 --> 00:30:04.560 align:middle line:90%
at the same time--

00:30:04.560 --> 00:30:07.740 align:middle line:84%
Ken Kesey, even like
Aldous Huxley, all

00:30:07.740 --> 00:30:10.050 align:middle line:84%
these very influential
people in the culture.

00:30:10.050 --> 00:30:11.680 align:middle line:84%
And LSD overtook
the magic mushrooms,

00:30:11.680 --> 00:30:13.680 align:middle line:84%
and it was from the
[? labels ?] of psychedelic.

00:30:13.680 --> 00:30:15.980 align:middle line:90%
But it started with a mushroom.

00:30:15.980 --> 00:30:18.840 align:middle line:84%
It started with an entheogen.
And so now the modern culture

00:30:18.840 --> 00:30:21.720 align:middle line:84%
is going back down to the
jungle working with psilocybin,

00:30:21.720 --> 00:30:26.460 align:middle line:84%
salvia divinorum,
San Pedro cactus,

00:30:26.460 --> 00:30:30.210 align:middle line:84%
but ayahuasca has really
become the predominant avatar

00:30:30.210 --> 00:30:32.924 align:middle line:84%
of the planetary intelligence
connecting with people.

00:30:32.924 --> 00:30:34.590 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Well, going
back to mushrooms,

00:30:34.590 --> 00:30:36.370 align:middle line:84%
are you telling
me I did it wrong?

00:30:36.370 --> 00:30:36.630 align:middle line:90%
>>RAZAM: There's no wrong.

00:30:36.630 --> 00:30:37.430 align:middle line:90%
There's no wrong.

00:30:37.430 --> 00:30:39.090 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: At the
end of a ski day,

00:30:39.090 --> 00:30:41.340 align:middle line:84%
drank some in a
milkshake in Bar One

00:30:41.340 --> 00:30:43.626 align:middle line:84%
at Squaw Valley
bustling with people.

00:30:43.626 --> 00:30:45.780 align:middle line:90%
>>RAZAM: How was that for you?

00:30:45.780 --> 00:30:47.824 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: It was interesting.

00:30:47.824 --> 00:30:48.990 align:middle line:90%
It was actually interesting.

00:30:48.990 --> 00:30:51.360 align:middle line:84%
I hadn't tried it before, so
I didn't know what to expect.

00:30:51.360 --> 00:30:53.026 align:middle line:84%
>>RAZAM: Well, this
is the thing though.

00:30:53.026 --> 00:30:56.670 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: My knees
became rubber.

00:30:56.670 --> 00:30:59.730 align:middle line:84%
I only did it one other time,
because once it kicked in,

00:30:59.730 --> 00:31:00.932 align:middle line:90%
I couldn't move anywhere.

00:31:00.932 --> 00:31:01.890 align:middle line:90%
My knees wouldn't work.

00:31:01.890 --> 00:31:03.450 align:middle line:84%
>>RAZAM: I think
you're sensitive.

00:31:03.450 --> 00:31:05.120 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: I couldn't walk,
and the other thing--

00:31:05.120 --> 00:31:07.411 align:middle line:84%
but of course, you know, the
love filter, which is like

00:31:07.411 --> 00:31:09.550 align:middle line:84%
if I have a cocktail
or something, love just

00:31:09.550 --> 00:31:10.350 align:middle line:90%
starts pouring out.

00:31:10.350 --> 00:31:12.180 align:middle line:84%
You just want to, I love
you and you and you.

00:31:12.180 --> 00:31:13.710 align:middle line:84%
>>RAZAM: Well, you think
that the legacy of--

00:31:13.710 --> 00:31:16.020 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: But I sat there
for four hours not able

00:31:16.020 --> 00:31:18.100 align:middle line:84%
to get off the stool,
because I couldn't walk.

00:31:18.100 --> 00:31:20.100 align:middle line:84%
And the same thing happened
the next time, which

00:31:20.100 --> 00:31:23.430 align:middle line:84%
was in the basement of
the Deutsches Museum

00:31:23.430 --> 00:31:26.730 align:middle line:84%
down where the tar baskets and
cutaway of submarines were,

00:31:26.730 --> 00:31:27.810 align:middle line:90%
ground floor.

00:31:27.810 --> 00:31:29.540 align:middle line:84%
Same thing-- sat
there the whole--

00:31:29.540 --> 00:31:30.780 align:middle line:84%
most of the afternoon
I couldn't move.

00:31:30.780 --> 00:31:32.200 align:middle line:84%
>>RAZAM: The best
place is nature.

00:31:32.200 --> 00:31:32.500 align:middle line:90%
Right?

00:31:32.500 --> 00:31:33.330 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: OK.

00:31:33.330 --> 00:31:34.950 align:middle line:84%
>>RAZAM: Because
Timothy Leary brought

00:31:34.950 --> 00:31:36.240 align:middle line:90%
this idea of set and setting.

00:31:36.240 --> 00:31:39.120 align:middle line:84%
He had the famous turn
on, tune in, drop out.

00:31:39.120 --> 00:31:41.710 align:middle line:90%
And it did what it did.

00:31:41.710 --> 00:31:43.260 align:middle line:84%
But one of his
other key things was

00:31:43.260 --> 00:31:45.890 align:middle line:84%
the idea of set and setting,
that it's your mindset

00:31:45.890 --> 00:31:48.480 align:middle line:84%
and how you feel when you
take a mind-expanding thing

00:31:48.480 --> 00:31:50.550 align:middle line:84%
or an entheogen or
things like that,

00:31:50.550 --> 00:31:52.710 align:middle line:84%
and it's the context
you do it in.

00:31:52.710 --> 00:31:56.660 align:middle line:84%
So if you do it at a
noisy club, rave, inside,

00:31:56.660 --> 00:31:59.430 align:middle line:84%
and with other people
around, as your sensitivity

00:31:59.430 --> 00:32:02.430 align:middle line:84%
and your capacity to get
full spectrum consciousness

00:32:02.430 --> 00:32:04.960 align:middle line:84%
starts to expand, you're
going to get all this energy

00:32:04.960 --> 00:32:05.760 align:middle line:90%
from all people.

00:32:05.760 --> 00:32:07.260 align:middle line:84%
And you might not
want that energy.

00:32:07.260 --> 00:32:08.790 align:middle line:84%
It's like, oh,
not only do I have

00:32:08.790 --> 00:32:10.320 align:middle line:84%
to deal with expanded
consciousness.

00:32:10.320 --> 00:32:13.250 align:middle line:84%
Now I have to deal without being
able to read the body language

00:32:13.250 --> 00:32:15.270 align:middle line:84%
and almost telepathy
with all these people

00:32:15.270 --> 00:32:19.680 align:middle line:84%
and keep it together and make
out that I'm still the same.

00:32:19.680 --> 00:32:22.750 align:middle line:84%
And if you're just in
nature, nature is the mother.

00:32:22.750 --> 00:32:24.436 align:middle line:90%
I mean don't be around people.

00:32:24.436 --> 00:32:25.310 align:middle line:90%
If you are going to--

00:32:25.310 --> 00:32:25.720 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: I didn't mind.

00:32:25.720 --> 00:32:27.210 align:middle line:90%
I just loved all of them more.

00:32:27.210 --> 00:32:28.543 align:middle line:90%
>>RAZAM: Well, that's good, too.

00:32:28.543 --> 00:32:31.220 align:middle line:84%
But it's so much better to
do it in a context of set

00:32:31.220 --> 00:32:32.020 align:middle line:90%
and setting.

00:32:32.020 --> 00:32:32.180 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Sure.

00:32:32.180 --> 00:32:33.400 align:middle line:90%
It makes total sense.

00:32:33.400 --> 00:32:36.060 align:middle line:84%
>>RAZAM: And this is, again,
the thing which didn't transmit

00:32:36.060 --> 00:32:36.900 align:middle line:90%
from the '60s--

00:32:36.900 --> 00:32:38.970 align:middle line:90%
I mean the best--

00:32:38.970 --> 00:32:41.130 align:middle line:84%
Harvard had their
stream, and then

00:32:41.130 --> 00:32:44.760 align:middle line:84%
they wanted to make it more of
a religious stream of doing it

00:32:44.760 --> 00:32:47.380 align:middle line:84%
in concert with meditation,
experimentation,

00:32:47.380 --> 00:32:49.560 align:middle line:84%
and Tim Leary went
very religious.

00:32:49.560 --> 00:32:53.130 align:middle line:84%
Ken Kesey, who's a big hero of
mine, took it to the masses.

00:32:53.130 --> 00:32:55.380 align:middle line:84%
And they did have
a set and setting,

00:32:55.380 --> 00:32:59.970 align:middle line:84%
but essentially, they
reinvented or reinterpreted

00:32:59.970 --> 00:33:04.950 align:middle line:84%
the tribal ritual, the archaic
revival of strobe lights,

00:33:04.950 --> 00:33:08.640 align:middle line:84%
the party, the altered
states, and the ritual

00:33:08.640 --> 00:33:10.311 align:middle line:84%
of the group mind
and of the tribe.

00:33:10.311 --> 00:33:11.560 align:middle line:90%
And that was really important.

00:33:11.560 --> 00:33:13.060 align:middle line:84%
A lot of people
criticized Ken Kesey

00:33:13.060 --> 00:33:15.420 align:middle line:84%
for just that seeing it
as more recreationally,

00:33:15.420 --> 00:33:19.260 align:middle line:84%
but it was a container, and
it was a tribal ceremony.

00:33:19.260 --> 00:33:21.570 align:middle line:84%
It didn't have the rigorous
structure and support

00:33:21.570 --> 00:33:26.150 align:middle line:84%
mechanisms that, perhaps, modern
ayahuasca culture does have,

00:33:26.150 --> 00:33:29.290 align:middle line:84%
but it did transmit that
idea and make it popular

00:33:29.290 --> 00:33:30.090 align:middle line:90%
and transmitted.

00:33:30.090 --> 00:33:31.320 align:middle line:84%
I don't think
there's any wrongs.

00:33:31.320 --> 00:33:31.870 align:middle line:90%
I think everything--

00:33:31.870 --> 00:33:33.060 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Because
it was popular,

00:33:33.060 --> 00:33:34.710 align:middle line:84%
though, everybody
just tapped into it

00:33:34.710 --> 00:33:36.210 align:middle line:84%
the way they wanted
to with their friends

00:33:36.210 --> 00:33:36.730 align:middle line:90%
wherever they were.

00:33:36.730 --> 00:33:38.445 align:middle line:84%
>>RAZAM: And then it did become
more recreational and diluted

00:33:38.445 --> 00:33:39.230 align:middle line:90%
and underground.

00:33:39.230 --> 00:33:40.290 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: It was
totally recreational.

00:33:40.290 --> 00:33:41.520 align:middle line:84%
>>RAZAM: But at the
peak of the '60s,

00:33:41.520 --> 00:33:42.930 align:middle line:90%
it was a planetary initiation.

00:33:42.930 --> 00:33:45.060 align:middle line:84%
And I believe it changed
the course of history

00:33:45.060 --> 00:33:47.550 align:middle line:84%
in so many ways,
that LSD essentially

00:33:47.550 --> 00:33:49.590 align:middle line:90%
acted as a psychic lubricant.

00:33:49.590 --> 00:33:52.140 align:middle line:84%
And back in the '50s,
when it was legal,

00:33:52.140 --> 00:33:54.000 align:middle line:84%
it was being used
around Palo Alto, which

00:33:54.000 --> 00:33:55.680 align:middle line:90%
is now called Silicon Valley.

00:33:55.680 --> 00:33:58.740 align:middle line:84%
And it was used by all different
people in corporations,

00:33:58.740 --> 00:34:01.050 align:middle line:84%
in computing, in all
these different industries

00:34:01.050 --> 00:34:02.520 align:middle line:90%
to stretch their consciousness.

00:34:02.520 --> 00:34:05.907 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Was it used by SRI
and some of the other agencies?

00:34:05.907 --> 00:34:06.740 align:middle line:90%
>>RAZAM: I think so.

00:34:06.740 --> 00:34:07.860 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Yeah, because
that's why they were

00:34:07.860 --> 00:34:08.960 align:middle line:90%
down there studying it, right?

00:34:08.960 --> 00:34:09.420 align:middle line:90%
>>RAZAM: Yeah.

00:34:09.420 --> 00:34:11.310 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: They were
looking-- and again, you

00:34:11.310 --> 00:34:14.250 align:middle line:84%
don't need any of it to do
remote viewing and all of that.

00:34:14.250 --> 00:34:16.949 align:middle line:84%
But I can see where
you could take someone

00:34:16.949 --> 00:34:19.980 align:middle line:84%
that has potential, and
then, perhaps, expand

00:34:19.980 --> 00:34:21.900 align:middle line:90%
their capabilities by using.

00:34:21.900 --> 00:34:23.030 align:middle line:90%
>>RAZAM: But you know what?

00:34:23.030 --> 00:34:24.107 align:middle line:90%
If you think of what--

00:34:24.107 --> 00:34:25.940 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: SRI stands
for Research Institute,

00:34:25.940 --> 00:34:28.520 align:middle line:84%
Russell Targ, the
training of CIA spies.

00:34:28.520 --> 00:34:29.320 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:34:29.320 --> 00:34:30.000 align:middle line:90%
That's what we're talking about.

00:34:30.000 --> 00:34:30.500 align:middle line:90%
Remote viewers.

00:34:30.500 --> 00:34:31.250 align:middle line:84%
>>RAZAM: Well, there was
that-- we haven't even

00:34:31.250 --> 00:34:33.644 align:middle line:84%
got into MK Ultra, which
is pretty documented.

00:34:33.644 --> 00:34:36.060 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: No, we can get into
that, because my audience is

00:34:36.060 --> 00:34:37.018 align:middle line:90%
familiar with all this.

00:34:37.018 --> 00:34:38.969 align:middle line:84%
I just wanted to
bring it up that I

00:34:38.969 --> 00:34:40.680 align:middle line:84%
do believe these
worlds interfaced.

00:34:40.680 --> 00:34:41.480 align:middle line:90%
>>RAZAM: They did.

00:34:41.480 --> 00:34:44.470 align:middle line:84%
I have these questions a lot
about psychedelic culture.

00:34:44.470 --> 00:34:45.270 align:middle line:90%
I mean why--

00:34:45.270 --> 00:34:46.949 align:middle line:84%
I mean the CIA were
basically looking

00:34:46.949 --> 00:34:51.449 align:middle line:84%
from the late '40s onwards for
a truth serum or something that

00:34:51.449 --> 00:34:55.380 align:middle line:84%
could give them a one up
over the enemy, the Russians

00:34:55.380 --> 00:34:56.639 align:middle line:90%
or whatever.

00:34:56.639 --> 00:34:59.550 align:middle line:84%
But essentially, you read
books like "Acid Dreams."

00:34:59.550 --> 00:35:03.570 align:middle line:84%
It's a really good biography
of the history of LSD.

00:35:03.570 --> 00:35:05.930 align:middle line:84%
There's a few others
out there as well.

00:35:05.930 --> 00:35:08.190 align:middle line:84%
And they really document
the role of the CIA

00:35:08.190 --> 00:35:10.752 align:middle line:84%
in bringing LSD to
the masses, and they

00:35:10.752 --> 00:35:12.210 align:middle line:84%
were giving it to
the psychiatrists

00:35:12.210 --> 00:35:13.010 align:middle line:90%
and psychologists.

00:35:13.010 --> 00:35:17.466 align:middle line:90%
And they were turning people on.

00:35:17.466 --> 00:35:18.840 align:middle line:84%
Aldous Huxley and
all people like

00:35:18.840 --> 00:35:21.240 align:middle line:84%
that were turned
on by people, who

00:35:21.240 --> 00:35:24.180 align:middle line:84%
had the connections to
those deeper levels.

00:35:24.180 --> 00:35:28.230 align:middle line:84%
But they were essentially
using it as a mind-expanding

00:35:28.230 --> 00:35:29.490 align:middle line:90%
or creativity tool.

00:35:29.490 --> 00:35:31.920 align:middle line:84%
And the thing about corporate
America in the '50s--

00:35:31.920 --> 00:35:35.650 align:middle line:84%
imagine-- I call it the white
picket fence 1950s Americana

00:35:35.650 --> 00:35:36.460 align:middle line:90%
mentality.

00:35:36.460 --> 00:35:37.900 align:middle line:84%
You've gone through the
horrors of World War

00:35:37.900 --> 00:35:39.660 align:middle line:84%
II and this cultural
reconditioning.

00:35:39.660 --> 00:35:40.110 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: You just
want to feel safe.

00:35:40.110 --> 00:35:41.734 align:middle line:84%
>>RAZAM: Well, suburbia
was essentially

00:35:41.734 --> 00:35:45.000 align:middle line:84%
invented to really bring people
in on that level afterwards.

00:35:45.000 --> 00:35:47.610 align:middle line:84%
And all these sort of
political machinations of,

00:35:47.610 --> 00:35:48.884 align:middle line:90%
what do we want culture to be?

00:35:48.884 --> 00:35:50.050 align:middle line:90%
How's it going to look like?

00:35:50.050 --> 00:35:51.120 align:middle line:90%
How are we going to into it?

00:35:51.120 --> 00:35:52.800 align:middle line:84%
But how do you change
the consciousness

00:35:52.800 --> 00:35:54.780 align:middle line:90%
of people from one--

00:35:54.780 --> 00:35:57.726 align:middle line:84%
you go from agrarian to
industrial to suburban.

00:35:57.726 --> 00:35:59.100 align:middle line:84%
There's all these
different phase

00:35:59.100 --> 00:36:03.240 align:middle line:84%
changes between how we live in
different cultural contexts.

00:36:03.240 --> 00:36:06.304 align:middle line:84%
And not only that, you look
at the inventions of things

00:36:06.304 --> 00:36:07.345 align:middle line:90%
that were coming through.

00:36:07.345 --> 00:36:10.530 align:middle line:84%
So you have radio, you have TV,
and then you have computing.

00:36:10.530 --> 00:36:12.260 align:middle line:84%
And to go from a
linear consciousness--

00:36:12.260 --> 00:36:14.760 align:middle line:84%
this is the key, I think-- to
go from a consciousness, which

00:36:14.760 --> 00:36:17.700 align:middle line:84%
understands linear time,
to a consciousness, which

00:36:17.700 --> 00:36:23.000 align:middle line:84%
can understand computing and
that sense of ones in binary

00:36:23.000 --> 00:36:27.530 align:middle line:84%
and ones in naughts and almost
like quantum levels of things.

00:36:27.530 --> 00:36:29.670 align:middle line:84%
We're not saying
like LSD directly

00:36:29.670 --> 00:36:33.432 align:middle line:84%
created the computer
revolution or the internet

00:36:33.432 --> 00:36:35.890 align:middle line:84%
or different things like that,
but for many people involved

00:36:35.890 --> 00:36:37.870 align:middle line:84%
in those industries,
who were using it,

00:36:37.870 --> 00:36:41.200 align:middle line:84%
and there's documented
usage in their fields,

00:36:41.200 --> 00:36:43.730 align:middle line:84%
I think it helps stretch
their psychic envelope

00:36:43.730 --> 00:36:44.530 align:middle line:90%
to understand--

00:36:44.530 --> 00:36:45.738 align:middle line:90%
I mean look what we have now.

00:36:45.738 --> 00:36:48.250 align:middle line:84%
We have a non-linear
appreciation

00:36:48.250 --> 00:36:49.300 align:middle line:90%
of what reality can be.

00:36:49.300 --> 00:36:50.830 align:middle line:84%
We have a distributed
consciousness,

00:36:50.830 --> 00:36:53.440 align:middle line:84%
where we can have 5,000
people in a Facebook feed.

00:36:53.440 --> 00:36:57.160 align:middle line:84%
We're in a feed, and we're like
grazing like digital telepathy

00:36:57.160 --> 00:36:58.530 align:middle line:90%
on all these people.

00:36:58.530 --> 00:37:01.270 align:middle line:84%
Or we have cloud
computing to upload--

00:37:01.270 --> 00:37:02.830 align:middle line:84%
it's almost like
the Akashic records.

00:37:02.830 --> 00:37:05.350 align:middle line:84%
We can understand
information, and we're not

00:37:05.350 --> 00:37:07.420 align:middle line:84%
trapped in this linear
consciousness, which

00:37:07.420 --> 00:37:09.730 align:middle line:84%
is, I think, the
legacy of the '60s that

00:37:09.730 --> 00:37:10.900 align:middle line:90%
is quite underappreciated.

00:37:10.900 --> 00:37:14.200 align:middle line:84%
We stretched our capacity
to think differently.

00:37:14.200 --> 00:37:17.450 align:middle line:84%
We won't even mention Steve
Jobs and Bill Gates taking acid

00:37:17.450 --> 00:37:18.250 align:middle line:90%
in the '70s.

00:37:18.250 --> 00:37:20.570 align:middle line:84%
But I mean this is the real
key to think differently.

00:37:20.570 --> 00:37:22.750 align:middle line:84%
So now we see
microdosing is hugely

00:37:22.750 --> 00:37:25.740 align:middle line:84%
popular with psychedelics again,
and all mainstream media is

00:37:25.740 --> 00:37:30.280 align:middle line:84%
starting to report on it and how
to optimize our own capacities

00:37:30.280 --> 00:37:32.470 align:middle line:84%
without going to a deep
psychedelic experience.

00:37:32.470 --> 00:37:34.750 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Well, let me
ask you this question,

00:37:34.750 --> 00:37:38.230 align:middle line:84%
and I've already
touched on it before.

00:37:38.230 --> 00:37:40.812 align:middle line:84%
Some of the curanderos
that you met

00:37:40.812 --> 00:37:43.020 align:middle line:84%
with when you did your "Aya,"
your film on ayahuasca.

00:37:43.020 --> 00:37:44.640 align:middle line:84%
>>RAZAM: We haven't
even got into that yet.

00:37:44.640 --> 00:37:46.598 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: No, we're going
to get into all that.

00:37:46.598 --> 00:37:47.500 align:middle line:90%
We have time still.

00:37:47.500 --> 00:37:51.520 align:middle line:84%
But they said that many of them
don't use-- they're trained.

00:37:51.520 --> 00:37:52.960 align:middle line:90%
They're trained to see.

00:37:52.960 --> 00:37:54.430 align:middle line:90%
So they can see into you.

00:37:54.430 --> 00:37:56.682 align:middle line:84%
They can see into a person
having the experience

00:37:56.682 --> 00:37:59.140 align:middle line:84%
and guide them, because they
can see where they've ended up

00:37:59.140 --> 00:38:00.520 align:middle line:90%
and where they're going.

00:38:00.520 --> 00:38:04.450 align:middle line:84%
But they themselves
often don't use,

00:38:04.450 --> 00:38:07.587 align:middle line:84%
whether it's ayahuasca or
the toad medicine or whatnot.

00:38:07.587 --> 00:38:09.670 align:middle line:84%
>>RAZAM: So essentially,
I went down to the Amazon

00:38:09.670 --> 00:38:12.514 align:middle line:84%
in 2006 to look at this
mythic role of the archetype

00:38:12.514 --> 00:38:13.930 align:middle line:84%
of the shaman and
what that really

00:38:13.930 --> 00:38:16.390 align:middle line:84%
meant in modern culture
because of this indigenous sort

00:38:16.390 --> 00:38:18.550 align:middle line:84%
of archetype; we'd
killed all our shamans,

00:38:18.550 --> 00:38:21.400 align:middle line:84%
and what was this rise in
popularity of ayahuasca.

00:38:21.400 --> 00:38:24.280 align:middle line:90%
So ayahuasca is a concoction.

00:38:24.280 --> 00:38:28.250 align:middle line:84%
It's a brew that is drunk
made from the ayahuasca vine,

00:38:28.250 --> 00:38:29.950 align:middle line:84%
the Banisteriopsis
caapi vine, which

00:38:29.950 --> 00:38:32.280 align:middle line:84%
contains harmine and
harmaline, and [INAUDIBLE]

00:38:32.280 --> 00:38:34.770 align:middle line:84%
to plants like chacruna,
which contain DMT.

00:38:34.770 --> 00:38:36.520 align:middle line:84%
Now DMT is getting
a lot of interest

00:38:36.520 --> 00:38:39.094 align:middle line:84%
these days, because it occurs
endogenously in our brains,

00:38:39.094 --> 00:38:41.260 align:middle line:84%
and Rick Strassmann, who I
think's been on your show

00:38:41.260 --> 00:38:44.680 align:middle line:84%
before, he did the legal test
over 20 years ago now looking

00:38:44.680 --> 00:38:48.190 align:middle line:84%
at DMT, smokable DMT
on its own and what

00:38:48.190 --> 00:38:50.850 align:middle line:84%
the effects of consciousness
are in human beings.

00:38:50.850 --> 00:38:53.050 align:middle line:84%
You know, it hasn't been
concretely proven, but what

00:38:53.050 --> 00:38:55.400 align:middle line:90%
people like to sort of--

00:38:55.400 --> 00:38:58.420 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: We call it the
God-- spirit molecule, right.

00:38:58.420 --> 00:39:01.090 align:middle line:84%
>>RAZAM: We think it's
intimately tied to the dreaming

00:39:01.090 --> 00:39:04.060 align:middle line:84%
process itself and going over
into that realm, but also,

00:39:04.060 --> 00:39:07.420 align:middle line:84%
at peak experiences like birth,
death, near death experiences,

00:39:07.420 --> 00:39:10.010 align:middle line:84%
when we have potentially what
we could call another paradigm

00:39:10.010 --> 00:39:13.060 align:middle line:84%
in mystical experiences,
the neurological responses

00:39:13.060 --> 00:39:13.910 align:middle line:90%
involving DMT--

00:39:13.910 --> 00:39:17.540 align:middle line:84%
it's very intimate in
the consciousness itself.

00:39:17.540 --> 00:39:19.205 align:middle line:90%
So the shamans of the Amazon--

00:39:19.205 --> 00:39:20.830 align:middle line:84%
and they don't call
themselves shamans.

00:39:20.830 --> 00:39:23.770 align:middle line:84%
All around the world, indigenous
cultures have medicine people,

00:39:23.770 --> 00:39:25.120 align:middle line:90%
and they might--

00:39:25.120 --> 00:39:27.970 align:middle line:84%
in Peru, they call themselves
curanderos from the Spanish

00:39:27.970 --> 00:39:30.020 align:middle line:90%
to cure or to heal.

00:39:30.020 --> 00:39:30.820 align:middle line:90%
And they work.

00:39:30.820 --> 00:39:34.350 align:middle line:84%
There's vegetalistas, who work
with many different plants.

00:39:34.350 --> 00:39:36.550 align:middle line:84%
There's perfumeros, who
work with flower instances.

00:39:36.550 --> 00:39:39.640 align:middle line:84%
There's ayahuasceros, who work
specifically with ayahuasca,

00:39:39.640 --> 00:39:42.052 align:middle line:84%
to vaqueros, who work
with the power of tobacco.

00:39:42.052 --> 00:39:43.510 align:middle line:84%
And in the West,
this is the thing.

00:39:43.510 --> 00:39:46.390 align:middle line:84%
For 500 years or more, as we
went over to the old world,

00:39:46.390 --> 00:39:48.790 align:middle line:84%
and we discovered
tobacco, and we discovered

00:39:48.790 --> 00:39:51.700 align:middle line:84%
all these other
mind-altering plants,

00:39:51.700 --> 00:39:55.030 align:middle line:84%
we have taken what was sacred,
and we've made it profane.

00:39:55.030 --> 00:39:57.580 align:middle line:84%
So today, tobacco is
used without intent.

00:39:57.580 --> 00:40:00.130 align:middle line:84%
Tobacco is one of the original
power plants, the master

00:40:00.130 --> 00:40:02.470 align:middle line:84%
plants, and the
spirit, they believe

00:40:02.470 --> 00:40:05.560 align:middle line:84%
in an indigenous Peruvian
cosmology in South America,

00:40:05.560 --> 00:40:07.306 align:middle line:90%
mostly indigenous tribes.

00:40:07.306 --> 00:40:09.430 align:middle line:84%
They believe that it's
almost like an animus thing,

00:40:09.430 --> 00:40:11.500 align:middle line:84%
that everything has a spirit,
especially all the living

00:40:11.500 --> 00:40:12.300 align:middle line:90%
things.

00:40:12.300 --> 00:40:14.020 align:middle line:84%
And we have
relationships with them.

00:40:14.020 --> 00:40:17.200 align:middle line:84%
So when we take these plants
like tobacco or ayahuasca,

00:40:17.200 --> 00:40:18.700 align:middle line:84%
we're entering
into a relationship

00:40:18.700 --> 00:40:20.500 align:middle line:84%
with the spirit in
the plant, not just

00:40:20.500 --> 00:40:22.520 align:middle line:90%
the chemical and the effect.

00:40:22.520 --> 00:40:25.420 align:middle line:84%
And so when we smoke
mapacho cigarettes

00:40:25.420 --> 00:40:29.210 align:middle line:84%
in ceremony with ayahuasca,
mapacho is a nicotina rustica.

00:40:29.210 --> 00:40:32.920 align:middle line:84%
It's an indigenous strain
of tobacco, 19% nicotine.

00:40:32.920 --> 00:40:35.750 align:middle line:84%
It's very pure, and I can't
smoke Western cigarettes,

00:40:35.750 --> 00:40:38.470 align:middle line:84%
but in ceremony, when
you smoke a mapacho,

00:40:38.470 --> 00:40:41.300 align:middle line:84%
you put your intent in the
breathing out of the smoke.

00:40:41.300 --> 00:40:43.450 align:middle line:84%
It's creating like a
carrier wave for you

00:40:43.450 --> 00:40:46.840 align:middle line:84%
to put your prayers into the
ceremony using the mapacha--

00:40:46.840 --> 00:40:47.930 align:middle line:90%
much more beautiful way.

00:40:47.930 --> 00:40:50.140 align:middle line:84%
So when you're smoking,
it's opening up the nicotine

00:40:50.140 --> 00:40:52.117 align:middle line:84%
receptors, but you're
doing something

00:40:52.117 --> 00:40:53.950 align:middle line:84%
with your consciousness
and the relationship

00:40:53.950 --> 00:40:56.200 align:middle line:90%
with the medicine of tobacco.

00:40:56.200 --> 00:41:00.631 align:middle line:84%
Similar with ayahuasca, what
I learned is that the shaman--

00:41:00.631 --> 00:41:01.630 align:middle line:90%
there's two main areas--

00:41:01.630 --> 00:41:03.430 align:middle line:84%
Pucallpa and Iquitos
in Peru, that

00:41:03.430 --> 00:41:05.140 align:middle line:84%
have become very
famous for ayahuasca,

00:41:05.140 --> 00:41:07.780 align:middle line:84%
what some people call
ayahuasca tourism.

00:41:07.780 --> 00:41:10.560 align:middle line:84%
I like to think of it more
as a pilgrimage and seekers

00:41:10.560 --> 00:41:12.280 align:middle line:84%
that are going
down to reconnect,

00:41:12.280 --> 00:41:15.280 align:middle line:84%
to learn, to heal, to
work on themselves.

00:41:15.280 --> 00:41:17.830 align:middle line:84%
And it's not just a
recreational pursuit.

00:41:17.830 --> 00:41:20.980 align:middle line:84%
Basically, I interviewed many,
many different curanderos,

00:41:20.980 --> 00:41:23.079 align:middle line:84%
and they said, look,
some people come down.

00:41:23.079 --> 00:41:25.120 align:middle line:84%
They have a physical
ailment, and ayahuasca's not

00:41:25.120 --> 00:41:26.860 align:middle line:84%
like this pill you
can take, and it will

00:41:26.860 --> 00:41:28.600 align:middle line:90%
cure everyone the same way.

00:41:28.600 --> 00:41:31.840 align:middle line:84%
It's a relationship you go into
with the spirit of ayahuasca,

00:41:31.840 --> 00:41:34.140 align:middle line:84%
what they call
madre, or the mother,

00:41:34.140 --> 00:41:36.250 align:middle line:90%
the mother spirit of ayahuasca.

00:41:36.250 --> 00:41:40.210 align:middle line:84%
And also, it is usually
used in concert with dietas,

00:41:40.210 --> 00:41:42.520 align:middle line:84%
with going down for
larger periods of time.

00:41:42.520 --> 00:41:45.460 align:middle line:84%
And as part of the diet to
increase your sensitivities so

00:41:45.460 --> 00:41:48.010 align:middle line:84%
that ayahuasca can work
on you, you give up,

00:41:48.010 --> 00:41:49.780 align:middle line:84%
or you make a
sacrifice of things

00:41:49.780 --> 00:41:53.650 align:middle line:84%
that are more toxic in our diets
or create more impediments--

00:41:53.650 --> 00:41:59.000 align:middle line:84%
sugar, salt, oil, red meat,
alcohol, and sex as well,

00:41:59.000 --> 00:41:59.800 align:middle line:90%
right?

00:41:59.800 --> 00:42:02.470 align:middle line:84%
Because all of these things are
affecting our energetic bodies,

00:42:02.470 --> 00:42:04.540 align:middle line:84%
so originally, what
they're essentially saying

00:42:04.540 --> 00:42:08.350 align:middle line:84%
is the fullness and the full
capacity of the human organism,

00:42:08.350 --> 00:42:11.350 align:middle line:84%
like babies when they're
born, is to be so sensitive.

00:42:11.350 --> 00:42:12.710 align:middle line:90%
They are connected to nature.

00:42:12.710 --> 00:42:14.200 align:middle line:90%
They are connected to energy.

00:42:14.200 --> 00:42:16.630 align:middle line:84%
They can feel all the
way back to divine source

00:42:16.630 --> 00:42:18.340 align:middle line:84%
the manifestation
and the connection,

00:42:18.340 --> 00:42:20.360 align:middle line:84%
and that's what
we're meant to be.

00:42:20.360 --> 00:42:21.160 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:42:21.160 --> 00:42:22.540 align:middle line:84%
>>RAZAM: But in
Western cultures,

00:42:22.540 --> 00:42:26.760 align:middle line:84%
essentially, we have created
energetic blocks as well as

00:42:26.760 --> 00:42:28.810 align:middle line:84%
a reinforcement of
the patriarchal egoic

00:42:28.810 --> 00:42:32.140 align:middle line:84%
consciousness, all of
which retard our ability

00:42:32.140 --> 00:42:34.030 align:middle line:90%
to tap into our full potential.

00:42:34.030 --> 00:42:36.870 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Yes, and
there's another area.

00:42:36.870 --> 00:42:41.450 align:middle line:84%
Often, in their own traditions,
these particular substances

00:42:41.450 --> 00:42:44.220 align:middle line:90%
were used to almost as--

00:42:44.220 --> 00:42:45.280 align:middle line:90%
what do you call it--

00:42:45.280 --> 00:42:49.120 align:middle line:84%
like exorcisms, to rid
the being of attachments

00:42:49.120 --> 00:42:51.160 align:middle line:90%
from other realm beings.

00:42:51.160 --> 00:42:54.230 align:middle line:84%
And to me this is a really
critical part of the story.

00:42:54.230 --> 00:42:57.720 align:middle line:84%
It's called vine
of the dead soul.

00:42:57.720 --> 00:42:58.520 align:middle line:90%
>>RAZAM: Yeah.

00:42:58.520 --> 00:42:59.644 align:middle line:90%
Well, these are two things.

00:42:59.644 --> 00:43:01.260 align:middle line:84%
Vine of the dead or
of the ancestors.

00:43:01.260 --> 00:43:02.060 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:43:02.060 --> 00:43:03.940 align:middle line:84%
But let's look at
that in general,

00:43:03.940 --> 00:43:08.080 align:middle line:84%
because the kind of
experiences people relay

00:43:08.080 --> 00:43:10.420 align:middle line:90%
often has to do with entities.

00:43:10.420 --> 00:43:14.440 align:middle line:84%
They can see and sense and
feel the presence of entities

00:43:14.440 --> 00:43:15.304 align:middle line:90%
from another realm.

00:43:15.304 --> 00:43:16.720 align:middle line:84%
One would, if
you're going to look

00:43:16.720 --> 00:43:18.910 align:middle line:84%
at it in metaphysical
terms, would probably

00:43:18.910 --> 00:43:20.740 align:middle line:90%
call that the astral realm.

00:43:20.740 --> 00:43:23.770 align:middle line:84%
This is where beings who
haven't transitioned over

00:43:23.770 --> 00:43:25.540 align:middle line:90%
are still in existence.

00:43:25.540 --> 00:43:27.490 align:middle line:90%
They're still hanging out there.

00:43:27.490 --> 00:43:30.070 align:middle line:84%
That would make
total sense to use

00:43:30.070 --> 00:43:36.970 align:middle line:84%
that to help scoot away beings
that are attached to a person

00:43:36.970 --> 00:43:38.500 align:middle line:90%
and disrupting their lives.

00:43:38.500 --> 00:43:41.461 align:middle line:84%
In fact, just as an
aside, years ago, I

00:43:41.461 --> 00:43:42.835 align:middle line:84%
had a little
hypnotherapy clinic,

00:43:42.835 --> 00:43:45.340 align:middle line:84%
so I worked with people
at a pretty deep level.

00:43:45.340 --> 00:43:52.390 align:middle line:84%
And I had a really avant garde,
spiritually-based teacher

00:43:52.390 --> 00:43:55.480 align:middle line:84%
for that process, that
certification, unusual

00:43:55.480 --> 00:43:56.410 align:middle line:90%
that way.

00:43:56.410 --> 00:43:58.360 align:middle line:84%
And he always explained
that if you're

00:43:58.360 --> 00:44:00.910 align:middle line:84%
looking at addictions
within the human,

00:44:00.910 --> 00:44:03.880 align:middle line:84%
you can almost
always find beings

00:44:03.880 --> 00:44:07.000 align:middle line:84%
in the astral realm attached
to them that are surfing off

00:44:07.000 --> 00:44:08.320 align:middle line:90%
of their energies.

00:44:08.320 --> 00:44:11.380 align:middle line:84%
You have to break the
connection of the spirits

00:44:11.380 --> 00:44:14.320 align:middle line:84%
from the person to
stop the addictions

00:44:14.320 --> 00:44:15.520 align:middle line:90%
in a lot of the cases.

00:44:15.520 --> 00:44:16.780 align:middle line:90%
And I did find that was true.

00:44:16.780 --> 00:44:18.940 align:middle line:84%
But here, you're going
into the realm of it

00:44:18.940 --> 00:44:20.820 align:middle line:90%
with the vine of the dead soul.

00:44:20.820 --> 00:44:21.620 align:middle line:90%
>>RAZAM: True.

00:44:21.620 --> 00:44:22.911 align:middle line:90%
So you know what's interesting?

00:44:22.911 --> 00:44:24.390 align:middle line:84%
It's like we didn't
really believe

00:44:24.390 --> 00:44:27.370 align:middle line:84%
there were viruses or
microbacteria, because we

00:44:27.370 --> 00:44:29.980 align:middle line:84%
didn't have the tools to see
until the microscope and things

00:44:29.980 --> 00:44:30.790 align:middle line:90%
like that.

00:44:30.790 --> 00:44:33.010 align:middle line:84%
And we had superstitious
beliefs, even

00:44:33.010 --> 00:44:35.410 align:middle line:84%
in medicine and science,
a few hundred years ago

00:44:35.410 --> 00:44:37.130 align:middle line:84%
of what was causing
these things,

00:44:37.130 --> 00:44:38.710 align:middle line:84%
because we didn't
really understand

00:44:38.710 --> 00:44:43.060 align:middle line:84%
the ecology of what we're really
in, only what we could see.

00:44:43.060 --> 00:44:46.510 align:middle line:84%
And so what I think is happening
with the shamanic world view

00:44:46.510 --> 00:44:49.750 align:middle line:84%
is that we're learning to
receive, to open up to a deeper

00:44:49.750 --> 00:44:52.420 align:middle line:84%
perception of energy, and
that the energetic ecology

00:44:52.420 --> 00:44:53.950 align:middle line:84%
of the physical
world doesn't stop

00:44:53.950 --> 00:44:55.570 align:middle line:90%
at the baseline physical world.

00:44:55.570 --> 00:44:57.830 align:middle line:84%
It goes into
energetic frequencies

00:44:57.830 --> 00:45:00.644 align:middle line:84%
of what we could call the astral
or what, in physics terms,

00:45:00.644 --> 00:45:02.560 align:middle line:84%
we might call hyper
dimensions like the Michio

00:45:02.560 --> 00:45:04.925 align:middle line:84%
Kaku says it's twelve
hyper dimensional levels.

00:45:04.925 --> 00:45:05.180 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: You can
call it hermetics.

00:45:05.180 --> 00:45:05.980 align:middle line:90%
Call them realms.

00:45:05.980 --> 00:45:08.880 align:middle line:84%
They are all different
names for these substrata

00:45:08.880 --> 00:45:09.870 align:middle line:90%
bands of frequencies.

00:45:09.870 --> 00:45:11.860 align:middle line:84%
>>RAZAM: Energy isn't
created or destroyed,

00:45:11.860 --> 00:45:14.760 align:middle line:84%
and it continues to radiate
in different levels of this.

00:45:14.760 --> 00:45:16.000 align:middle line:90%
But we just can't see them.

00:45:16.000 --> 00:45:16.800 align:middle line:90%
So we're getting--

00:45:16.800 --> 00:45:18.341 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So ayahuasca
helps open you

00:45:18.341 --> 00:45:19.500 align:middle line:90%
into those other realms.

00:45:19.500 --> 00:45:20.400 align:middle line:84%
>>RAZAM: So here's
the thing, yeah,

00:45:20.400 --> 00:45:22.960 align:middle line:84%
to finish off that other
bit is that many people were

00:45:22.960 --> 00:45:25.840 align:middle line:84%
coming down for healing and
working in concert with diets

00:45:25.840 --> 00:45:28.960 align:middle line:84%
and other plants and to
cleanse their bodies to open up

00:45:28.960 --> 00:45:30.535 align:middle line:90%
their full potential.

00:45:30.535 --> 00:45:32.160 align:middle line:84%
And then once we're
healed and cleaned,

00:45:32.160 --> 00:45:34.090 align:middle line:84%
we're receiving four
bar signal, and we're

00:45:34.090 --> 00:45:36.610 align:middle line:84%
living in concert in right
relationship with the earth,

00:45:36.610 --> 00:45:38.500 align:middle line:84%
and it's our full
human birthright.

00:45:38.500 --> 00:45:40.690 align:middle line:84%
But he said that the
majority of people--

00:45:40.690 --> 00:45:42.550 align:middle line:84%
this is what the
curanderos told me--

00:45:42.550 --> 00:45:44.620 align:middle line:84%
were coming down
with a sickness that

00:45:44.620 --> 00:45:46.330 align:middle line:90%
wasn't necessarily physical.

00:45:46.330 --> 00:45:49.870 align:middle line:84%
It was a disconnection from
themselves and from feeling

00:45:49.870 --> 00:45:50.980 align:middle line:90%
like they belonged.

00:45:50.980 --> 00:45:51.855 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Absolutely.

00:45:51.855 --> 00:45:52.930 align:middle line:90%
Now you were one of them.

00:45:52.930 --> 00:45:54.580 align:middle line:84%
You were feeling
kind of lost yourself

00:45:54.580 --> 00:45:56.830 align:middle line:84%
when you first took
this journey, right?

00:45:56.830 --> 00:45:58.810 align:middle line:84%
>>RAZAM: You know, in
the traditional narrative

00:45:58.810 --> 00:46:01.390 align:middle line:84%
structure, you're meant to
go down and be wounded and be

00:46:01.390 --> 00:46:02.360 align:middle line:90%
healed.

00:46:02.360 --> 00:46:04.960 align:middle line:84%
I didn't quite fit that,
because I'd also had--

00:46:04.960 --> 00:46:07.130 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Were you just
seeking, kind of lost in it?

00:46:07.130 --> 00:46:07.930 align:middle line:90%
You were seeking.

00:46:07.930 --> 00:46:08.990 align:middle line:84%
>>RAZAM: I was
definitely a seeker.

00:46:08.990 --> 00:46:10.740 align:middle line:84%
We were talking about
psychedelics before.

00:46:10.740 --> 00:46:13.860 align:middle line:84%
But I had my initiations with
psychedelics in my late teens

00:46:13.860 --> 00:46:15.610 align:middle line:90%
or actually in my early 20s.

00:46:15.610 --> 00:46:17.950 align:middle line:84%
But I've always be
interested, I guess,

00:46:17.950 --> 00:46:22.330 align:middle line:84%
in the shamanic and
psychedelic and potential

00:46:22.330 --> 00:46:23.720 align:middle line:90%
outside the mainstream culture.

00:46:23.720 --> 00:46:26.270 align:middle line:84%
So I think I'd had
initiations, and then

00:46:26.270 --> 00:46:29.560 align:middle line:84%
when shamanism started
to surface on my radar,

00:46:29.560 --> 00:46:30.360 align:middle line:90%
I went down there.

00:46:30.360 --> 00:46:31.070 align:middle line:90%
But you know what?

00:46:31.070 --> 00:46:32.819 align:middle line:84%
You're right, because
what really happened

00:46:32.819 --> 00:46:34.190 align:middle line:90%
was that I reconnected.

00:46:34.190 --> 00:46:35.630 align:middle line:84%
And even though
I didn't realize,

00:46:35.630 --> 00:46:37.650 align:middle line:84%
I didn't feel like
I was wounded,

00:46:37.650 --> 00:46:40.157 align:middle line:84%
I did have the traditional
Western disconnection

00:46:40.157 --> 00:46:41.990 align:middle line:84%
of what I believed in
in my mainstream, what

00:46:41.990 --> 00:46:43.640 align:middle line:90%
I believed was possible.

00:46:43.640 --> 00:46:46.790 align:middle line:84%
And belief is the intellect
and the ego thinking,

00:46:46.790 --> 00:46:48.680 align:middle line:84%
when the heart
feels, that's when

00:46:48.680 --> 00:46:50.960 align:middle line:84%
the true wisdom and
the true medicine is.

00:46:50.960 --> 00:46:53.750 align:middle line:84%
So many people who go down
and work with ayahuasca,

00:46:53.750 --> 00:46:55.360 align:middle line:84%
it can be working--
they say it's

00:46:55.360 --> 00:46:58.850 align:middle line:84%
the equivalent of like 10 years
of psychotherapy in one night.

00:46:58.850 --> 00:47:00.890 align:middle line:84%
And again, it's very
different for many people.

00:47:00.890 --> 00:47:02.240 align:middle line:90%
It's not like the Western drug.

00:47:02.240 --> 00:47:03.620 align:middle line:84%
It's all the same, because
it's the relationship.

00:47:03.620 --> 00:47:04.640 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Yeah,
it seems everybody

00:47:04.640 --> 00:47:04.900 align:middle line:90%
has a different experience.

00:47:04.900 --> 00:47:07.441 align:middle line:84%
>>RAZAM: But it's essentially
about getting to know yourself.

00:47:07.441 --> 00:47:10.010 align:middle line:84%
We know that with science
and doing the MRI scans,

00:47:10.010 --> 00:47:12.020 align:middle line:84%
we know the default
mode network goes off.

00:47:12.020 --> 00:47:13.940 align:middle line:84%
It's almost as if the
subconscious mind comes

00:47:13.940 --> 00:47:17.360 align:middle line:84%
up more, so any traumas or
wounds or energies you're

00:47:17.360 --> 00:47:20.060 align:middle line:84%
carrying, you can't escape
it, and it comes up.

00:47:20.060 --> 00:47:22.520 align:middle line:84%
And you get to sort through
stuff like in psychotherapy.

00:47:22.520 --> 00:47:24.870 align:middle line:84%
But you get to feel it from
another vantage point, where

00:47:24.870 --> 00:47:26.797 align:middle line:84%
you're not attached to
it and let go of it.

00:47:26.797 --> 00:47:28.880 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Well, you had
electrodes attached to you

00:47:28.880 --> 00:47:29.810 align:middle line:90%
when you were detaching.

00:47:29.810 --> 00:47:30.560 align:middle line:90%
>>RAZAM: Oh, you saw my film?

00:47:30.560 --> 00:47:31.190 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes, of course.

00:47:31.190 --> 00:47:31.550 align:middle line:90%
I watched it.

00:47:31.550 --> 00:47:32.500 align:middle line:90%
I took good notes.

00:47:32.500 --> 00:47:34.940 align:middle line:84%
But in any event, so
let's talk about that.

00:47:34.940 --> 00:47:37.110 align:middle line:90%
>>RAZAM: That was atypical.

00:47:37.110 --> 00:47:39.780 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Yeah, but let's talk
about that and what happened.

00:47:39.780 --> 00:47:43.647 align:middle line:84%
But let's also talk about
what the EEG was picking up.

00:47:43.647 --> 00:47:44.980 align:middle line:90%
>>RAZAM: Well, here's the thing.

00:47:44.980 --> 00:47:47.990 align:middle line:84%
The majority of people who go
down into ayahuasca culture,

00:47:47.990 --> 00:47:51.291 align:middle line:84%
and more and more in the
last 20, 25 years or so,

00:47:51.291 --> 00:47:53.540 align:middle line:84%
there's more lodges being
set up for people going down

00:47:53.540 --> 00:47:54.410 align:middle line:90%
in the West.

00:47:54.410 --> 00:47:56.420 align:middle line:84%
There are teething issues
around supply and demand

00:47:56.420 --> 00:47:58.128 align:middle line:84%
of the medicine and
more money going down

00:47:58.128 --> 00:48:00.560 align:middle line:84%
to there and shamans
and ethics and conduct.

00:48:00.560 --> 00:48:03.820 align:middle line:84%
But essentially, if you're
in the right container

00:48:03.820 --> 00:48:06.094 align:middle line:84%
and the right space,
you are going to have--

00:48:06.094 --> 00:48:07.760 align:middle line:84%
it's not just a
mind-opening experience.

00:48:07.760 --> 00:48:09.500 align:middle line:90%
It's a heart-opening experience.

00:48:09.500 --> 00:48:12.920 align:middle line:84%
So basically,
literally about a week

00:48:12.920 --> 00:48:17.030 align:middle line:84%
into my first three-month foray
into South America experiencing

00:48:17.030 --> 00:48:19.070 align:middle line:84%
ayahuasca, I was about
three or four ceremonies

00:48:19.070 --> 00:48:21.890 align:middle line:84%
in to resensitizing
to myself and

00:48:21.890 --> 00:48:25.280 align:middle line:84%
to the planetary intelligence,
the Gaian mind, mother nature,

00:48:25.280 --> 00:48:27.020 align:middle line:84%
and getting it, like
really getting it,

00:48:27.020 --> 00:48:29.311 align:middle line:84%
and being in this hyper
journalistic mode of writing it

00:48:29.311 --> 00:48:31.804 align:middle line:84%
all down and almost
essentially channeling

00:48:31.804 --> 00:48:32.720 align:middle line:90%
like I'm not thinking.

00:48:32.720 --> 00:48:34.830 align:middle line:84%
I'm feeling, and I'm in
these fresh experiences,

00:48:34.830 --> 00:48:37.370 align:middle line:84%
and I'm going through these
states of reconnection

00:48:37.370 --> 00:48:38.420 align:middle line:90%
with the planet.

00:48:38.420 --> 00:48:40.550 align:middle line:84%
And lo and behold, I
met Dr. Juan Acosta,

00:48:40.550 --> 00:48:44.120 align:middle line:84%
who is a trained
electroencephalography

00:48:44.120 --> 00:48:45.130 align:middle line:90%
practitioner.

00:48:45.130 --> 00:48:46.490 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So he hooked you
up, electrodes everywhere.

00:48:46.490 --> 00:48:48.698 align:middle line:84%
>>RAZAM: He was working with
Ron Wheelock, the gringo

00:48:48.698 --> 00:48:49.520 align:middle line:90%
shaman of Iquitos.

00:48:49.520 --> 00:48:52.250 align:middle line:84%
And we were working
with synthetic 5-MEO-DMT

00:48:52.250 --> 00:48:54.050 align:middle line:84%
on plant materials
infused on that,

00:48:54.050 --> 00:48:55.780 align:middle line:90%
which was legal at the time.

00:48:55.780 --> 00:48:59.060 align:middle line:84%
5-MEO-DMT is sometimes
in ayahuasca brews.

00:48:59.060 --> 00:49:01.370 align:middle line:84%
Some tribes in
Ecuador and Colombia

00:49:01.370 --> 00:49:04.700 align:middle line:84%
use it in their yage brews,
their name for ayahuasca.

00:49:04.700 --> 00:49:06.830 align:middle line:84%
So the NN DMT we
were talking about

00:49:06.830 --> 00:49:08.720 align:middle line:84%
before with Rick
Strassmann, that

00:49:08.720 --> 00:49:10.289 align:middle line:90%
has the visionary component.

00:49:10.289 --> 00:49:12.080 align:middle line:84%
And the reason why so
many people, I think,

00:49:12.080 --> 00:49:15.000 align:middle line:84%
were going down to the West
to reconnect with ayahuasca,

00:49:15.000 --> 00:49:15.800 align:middle line:90%
they wanted--

00:49:15.800 --> 00:49:17.240 align:middle line:84%
they call them the
vision seekers.

00:49:17.240 --> 00:49:18.590 align:middle line:90%
They wanted to see.

00:49:18.590 --> 00:49:22.280 align:middle line:84%
They wanted to feel, because
their intellect in our culture,

00:49:22.280 --> 00:49:24.140 align:middle line:84%
if you see it, you
believe it, right?

00:49:24.140 --> 00:49:26.300 align:middle line:84%
And in the indigenous
curanderos,

00:49:26.300 --> 00:49:28.850 align:middle line:84%
they used to drink ayahuasca
on behalf of their patient,

00:49:28.850 --> 00:49:30.559 align:middle line:84%
and the patients
wouldn't take ayahuasca.

00:49:30.559 --> 00:49:32.600 align:middle line:84%
They didn't need to see,
because the shaman would

00:49:32.600 --> 00:49:34.910 align:middle line:84%
do the work on them, and
he would energetically--

00:49:34.910 --> 00:49:37.070 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Probably
dislodge whatever entities

00:49:37.070 --> 00:49:37.880 align:middle line:90%
were hanging on and so forth.

00:49:37.880 --> 00:49:39.410 align:middle line:84%
>>RAZAM: Whatever was in them,
whatever [INAUDIBLE] in them

00:49:39.410 --> 00:49:40.610 align:middle line:90%
in the energetic ecology.

00:49:40.610 --> 00:49:42.650 align:middle line:84%
But the Westerners came
wanting the visions,

00:49:42.650 --> 00:49:43.730 align:middle line:84%
and they wanted the
visions, because they

00:49:43.730 --> 00:49:45.280 align:middle line:84%
wanted to prove
to their intellect

00:49:45.280 --> 00:49:47.660 align:middle line:84%
that something was really
true with going on here.

00:49:47.660 --> 00:49:49.460 align:middle line:84%
But then what they
found was that they

00:49:49.460 --> 00:49:51.260 align:middle line:84%
were feeling and
reconnecting, and it

00:49:51.260 --> 00:49:54.240 align:middle line:84%
was opening up all these
worlds of feeling and capacity.

00:49:54.240 --> 00:49:57.410 align:middle line:84%
So a week into that
experience myself, I

00:49:57.410 --> 00:50:02.126 align:middle line:84%
encountered 5-MEO-DMT with
this rogue neuroscientist

00:50:02.126 --> 00:50:03.500 align:middle line:84%
on the frontiers
of consciousness

00:50:03.500 --> 00:50:06.530 align:middle line:84%
hooking me up to a 19-channel
electrode cap with wet gel,

00:50:06.530 --> 00:50:10.480 align:middle line:84%
putting the blindfold on,
meditating, smoking 5-MEO-DMT,

00:50:10.480 --> 00:50:13.430 align:middle line:84%
and firing me what I call
into the mind of God.

00:50:13.430 --> 00:50:16.520 align:middle line:84%
Like I mean, this gets
to the edge of language

00:50:16.520 --> 00:50:18.540 align:middle line:84%
and to the bits where
whatever words I say

00:50:18.540 --> 00:50:19.670 align:middle line:84%
are going to have
triggers for people.

00:50:19.670 --> 00:50:21.590 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Well, you didn't
have a lot of words.

00:50:21.590 --> 00:50:23.210 align:middle line:84%
>>RAZAM: Well, I brought
back a lot of words.

00:50:23.210 --> 00:50:24.585 align:middle line:84%
It's a whole
chapter in the book.

00:50:24.585 --> 00:50:26.185 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: But in
the experience, it

00:50:26.185 --> 00:50:28.310 align:middle line:84%
was hard to articulate
while you were [INAUDIBLE]..

00:50:28.310 --> 00:50:29.893 align:middle line:84%
>>RAZAM: It's very
hard to articulate.

00:50:29.893 --> 00:50:32.510 align:middle line:84%
So what I've really
understood in recent times

00:50:32.510 --> 00:50:34.834 align:middle line:84%
that there's a
gradiation of energy,

00:50:34.834 --> 00:50:36.500 align:middle line:84%
and I've been getting
into more Sanskrit

00:50:36.500 --> 00:50:39.170 align:middle line:84%
culture and their
maps of consciousness

00:50:39.170 --> 00:50:40.670 align:middle line:90%
and Samadhi states.

00:50:40.670 --> 00:50:43.340 align:middle line:84%
And they've left this... them
and like the Buddhist culture

00:50:43.340 --> 00:50:45.140 align:middle line:90%
idea of the bardo states.

00:50:45.140 --> 00:50:47.840 align:middle line:84%
So there's this
beautiful little quote.

00:50:47.840 --> 00:50:49.505 align:middle line:84%
I might be paraphrasing,
but it says

00:50:49.505 --> 00:50:53.360 align:middle line:84%
there's 50,000 levels of
Maya between you and God,

00:50:53.360 --> 00:50:55.460 align:middle line:90%
but none between God and you.

00:50:55.460 --> 00:50:59.090 align:middle line:84%
So if you say deep
source or Samadhi state

00:50:59.090 --> 00:51:01.970 align:middle line:84%
or the field or the force
or whatever language

00:51:01.970 --> 00:51:05.780 align:middle line:84%
you have to describe this
oceanic reunification

00:51:05.780 --> 00:51:09.920 align:middle line:84%
with the very presence
of creation itself,

00:51:09.920 --> 00:51:12.800 align:middle line:84%
that is where 5-MEO took me,
and in most people's reports,

00:51:12.800 --> 00:51:13.700 align:middle line:90%
it takes them.

00:51:13.700 --> 00:51:15.449 align:middle line:84%
Now the interesting
thing about 5-MEO-DMT,

00:51:15.449 --> 00:51:17.600 align:middle line:90%
it is in some ayahuasca brews.

00:51:17.600 --> 00:51:20.605 align:middle line:84%
The Secoya in
Ecuador, they say they

00:51:20.605 --> 00:51:24.620 align:middle line:84%
were given the knowledge of
their yage brew a 5-MEO in it,

00:51:24.620 --> 00:51:26.630 align:middle line:84%
in their plant, their
[INAUDIBLE] plant,

00:51:26.630 --> 00:51:29.450 align:middle line:84%
from the star people who
live inside the light.

00:51:29.450 --> 00:51:32.510 align:middle line:84%
And there's different
levels within which

00:51:32.510 --> 00:51:36.740 align:middle line:84%
I found in the experience of
5-MEO, it opens and flowers

00:51:36.740 --> 00:51:38.180 align:middle line:90%
and reveals.

00:51:38.180 --> 00:51:41.000 align:middle line:84%
Most psychedelics, when
you're on them or entheogens,

00:51:41.000 --> 00:51:44.450 align:middle line:84%
you're on the thing, and it's
interfacing with the spirit

00:51:44.450 --> 00:51:45.610 align:middle line:90%
of the plant with you.

00:51:45.610 --> 00:51:46.960 align:middle line:90%
But there's still an ego.

00:51:46.960 --> 00:51:47.840 align:middle line:90%
There's still you.

00:51:47.840 --> 00:51:51.050 align:middle line:84%
On the 5-MEO
experience, it reveals

00:51:51.050 --> 00:51:53.660 align:middle line:84%
that the ego is just the
clothes that you're wearing,

00:51:53.660 --> 00:51:55.100 align:middle line:90%
and you are that thing.

00:51:55.100 --> 00:51:56.250 align:middle line:90%
You are that which is.

00:51:56.250 --> 00:51:58.132 align:middle line:84%
And it gets mystical,
and it gets religious,

00:51:58.132 --> 00:51:59.590 align:middle line:84%
and there's no
other way to say it.

00:51:59.590 --> 00:52:00.030 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Well, sure.

00:52:00.030 --> 00:52:00.260 align:middle line:90%
Of course.

00:52:00.260 --> 00:52:02.720 align:middle line:84%
I mean theoretically,
that's where it should go.

00:52:02.720 --> 00:52:06.140 align:middle line:84%
But what did it look
like on their end of it

00:52:06.140 --> 00:52:08.420 align:middle line:90%
with the graphs?

00:52:08.420 --> 00:52:10.840 align:middle line:84%
>>RAZAM: So yeah, the
data is available.

00:52:10.840 --> 00:52:13.354 align:middle line:84%
We've got the data up there
on one of our websites.

00:52:13.354 --> 00:52:15.020 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Because it
wasn't in the film.

00:52:15.020 --> 00:52:16.030 align:middle line:90%
The data wasn't in the film.

00:52:16.030 --> 00:52:17.870 align:middle line:84%
>>RAZAM: No, because we
had a nine-minute sequence,

00:52:17.870 --> 00:52:18.670 align:middle line:90%
which was--

00:52:18.670 --> 00:52:20.370 align:middle line:84%
I mean, again,
I've been filming--

00:52:20.370 --> 00:52:21.170 align:middle line:90%
attempting.

00:52:21.170 --> 00:52:22.671 align:middle line:84%
So this was actually
the centerpoint

00:52:22.671 --> 00:52:23.961 align:middle line:90%
of what became the film, "Aya--

00:52:23.961 --> 00:52:25.580 align:middle line:84%
Awakenings," based
on my book "Aya--

00:52:25.580 --> 00:52:26.380 align:middle line:90%
Awakenings."

00:52:26.380 --> 00:52:29.000 align:middle line:84%
And so it's about ayahuasca,
but it's also about awakening,

00:52:29.000 --> 00:52:31.406 align:middle line:84%
because what happened to me
was just 5-MEO experience,

00:52:31.406 --> 00:52:32.280 align:middle line:90%
and it's [INAUDIBLE].

00:52:32.280 --> 00:52:34.347 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: What's that look
like on the brain map?

00:52:34.347 --> 00:52:35.930 align:middle line:84%
>>RAZAM: On the
inside or the outside?

00:52:35.930 --> 00:52:36.610 align:middle line:90%
So on the brain map--

00:52:36.610 --> 00:52:37.860 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: No, on the
brain map on the outside,

00:52:37.860 --> 00:52:38.827 align:middle line:90%
then on the inside.

00:52:38.827 --> 00:52:40.410 align:middle line:84%
>>RAZAM: Well, the
problem is in 2006,

00:52:40.410 --> 00:52:42.880 align:middle line:84%
the 19 channel signals and
what you could measure,

00:52:42.880 --> 00:52:45.640 align:middle line:84%
if you have a movement
of jaw or eyelids,

00:52:45.640 --> 00:52:47.987 align:middle line:84%
it creates artifacts on the
EG readings, which are--

00:52:47.987 --> 00:52:49.820 align:middle line:84%
they're going through
the skull, and they're

00:52:49.820 --> 00:52:51.580 align:middle line:90%
reading your brain waves.

00:52:51.580 --> 00:52:52.205 align:middle line:84%
They have to go
through the skull.

00:52:52.205 --> 00:52:54.180 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: You had all the
portions of your brain wired?

00:52:54.180 --> 00:52:54.650 align:middle line:90%
>>RAZAM: Right.

00:52:54.650 --> 00:52:57.022 align:middle line:84%
Wired up to a computer,
[INAUDIBLE],, in meditation

00:52:57.022 --> 00:52:57.980 align:middle line:90%
pose, and I'm going in.

00:52:57.980 --> 00:53:00.296 align:middle line:84%
So we recreated in
the film what that

00:53:00.296 --> 00:53:01.670 align:middle line:84%
looks like, and
essentially, it's

00:53:01.670 --> 00:53:03.740 align:middle line:84%
the white light
mystical tunnel, which

00:53:03.740 --> 00:53:06.290 align:middle line:84%
I call like the super Hadron
Collider of hyperspace.

00:53:06.290 --> 00:53:09.800 align:middle line:84%
It's just you're going in
and in, and it's coming,

00:53:09.800 --> 00:53:13.340 align:middle line:84%
and it's revealing that Rumi,
the poet, the Persian poet,

00:53:13.340 --> 00:53:14.930 align:middle line:90%
has the most accurate quote.

00:53:14.930 --> 00:53:18.280 align:middle line:84%
He says, "The drop
rejoins the ocean."

00:53:18.280 --> 00:53:19.250 align:middle line:90%
And think about it.

00:53:19.250 --> 00:53:21.834 align:middle line:84%
Individuated consciousness--
you think you're an individual,

00:53:21.834 --> 00:53:23.750 align:middle line:84%
and then you go through
this experience, where

00:53:23.750 --> 00:53:26.870 align:middle line:84%
the cohesion of the
individuality wall falls away,

00:53:26.870 --> 00:53:28.900 align:middle line:84%
and you realize
you are the ocean.

00:53:28.900 --> 00:53:33.080 align:middle line:84%
And this is the most mystical
and profound and loving state.

00:53:33.080 --> 00:53:34.520 align:middle line:90%
It's like unconditional love.

00:53:34.520 --> 00:53:35.010 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Oh, yeah.

00:53:35.010 --> 00:53:36.990 align:middle line:84%
You were seemed like you
were definitely blissed out.

00:53:36.990 --> 00:53:37.130 align:middle line:90%
Again--

00:53:37.130 --> 00:53:37.635 align:middle line:90%
>>RAZAM: And so on the outside--

00:53:37.635 --> 00:53:38.980 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Yeah, what'd it
look like on the outside?

00:53:38.980 --> 00:53:40.563 align:middle line:84%
>>RAZAM: On the
outside, what it shows

00:53:40.563 --> 00:53:44.677 align:middle line:84%
is this body going through this
like spasm, this God spasm.

00:53:44.677 --> 00:53:46.760 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Oh, forget that
part, the science of it.

00:53:46.760 --> 00:53:47.640 align:middle line:90%
>>RAZAM: The brain wave--

00:53:47.640 --> 00:53:48.400 align:middle line:84%
that's what I'm
trying to tell you.

00:53:48.400 --> 00:53:50.907 align:middle line:84%
It's such a powerful effect
that it corrupted the data

00:53:50.907 --> 00:53:51.740 align:middle line:90%
to a certain degree.

00:53:51.740 --> 00:53:52.130 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Oh, I see.

00:53:52.130 --> 00:53:53.300 align:middle line:84%
>>RAZAM: What he
managed to get was--

00:53:53.300 --> 00:53:54.670 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Was it almost
like an electrical explosion

00:53:54.670 --> 00:53:55.020 align:middle line:90%
or something?

00:53:55.020 --> 00:53:57.228 align:middle line:84%
>>RAZAM: What he managed to
get while I was still was

00:53:57.228 --> 00:53:58.370 align:middle line:90%
essentially--

00:53:58.370 --> 00:54:00.110 align:middle line:84%
and I've been in
concert with Dr. Juan,

00:54:00.110 --> 00:54:02.720 align:middle line:90%
and so in 2015, Dr. Juan--

00:54:02.720 --> 00:54:03.610 align:middle line:90%
he stayed with me.

00:54:03.610 --> 00:54:06.410 align:middle line:84%
And so Dr. Juan and
I founded an NGO,

00:54:06.410 --> 00:54:09.020 align:middle line:84%
a 501(c)(3) called the
Terra Incognita Project.

00:54:09.020 --> 00:54:11.870 align:middle line:84%
It means the invisible
landscape, that of the mind.

00:54:11.870 --> 00:54:15.804 align:middle line:84%
And the neuroscience has caught
up with different EG helmets.

00:54:15.804 --> 00:54:17.720 align:middle line:84%
Now we can actually get
more accurate readings

00:54:17.720 --> 00:54:19.250 align:middle line:84%
of what's going on,
and we can cancel out

00:54:19.250 --> 00:54:20.490 align:middle line:90%
the other facts of the data.

00:54:20.490 --> 00:54:22.490 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Because you're
using an actual helmet,

00:54:22.490 --> 00:54:23.840 align:middle line:84%
so it's keeping the
electrodes in place.

00:54:23.840 --> 00:54:24.710 align:middle line:84%
>>RAZAM: It can get
wet or dry, and you

00:54:24.710 --> 00:54:26.251 align:middle line:84%
can get wireless
helmets, and there's

00:54:26.251 --> 00:54:28.687 align:middle line:84%
better extraction algorithms
for extracting out the data.

00:54:28.687 --> 00:54:30.770 align:middle line:84%
But essentially, not just
what he discovered then,

00:54:30.770 --> 00:54:32.186 align:middle line:84%
but what I've been
keeping up with

00:54:32.186 --> 00:54:34.400 align:middle line:84%
and what our NGO has
discovered working

00:54:34.400 --> 00:54:36.470 align:middle line:84%
with another
neuroscientist, Dr. Michael

00:54:36.470 --> 00:54:38.210 align:middle line:90%
Villanueva in San Diego--

00:54:38.210 --> 00:54:40.130 align:middle line:84%
we go over to Mexico to
do the legal research,

00:54:40.130 --> 00:54:42.470 align:middle line:84%
because it's still legal
in Mexico and in Canada

00:54:42.470 --> 00:54:44.630 align:middle line:84%
and many other countries
around the world.

00:54:44.630 --> 00:54:49.460 align:middle line:84%
Essentially, the
5-MEO experience can--

00:54:49.460 --> 00:54:52.800 align:middle line:84%
the frontal lobe cortex
of the brain flatlines.

00:54:52.800 --> 00:54:54.580 align:middle line:90%
You almost like--

00:54:54.580 --> 00:54:56.580 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Cognitive
processes are not happening.

00:54:56.580 --> 00:54:58.040 align:middle line:90%
>>RAZAM: The ego goes.

00:54:58.040 --> 00:55:01.070 align:middle line:84%
And remember that in the
last 10,000 years of history,

00:55:01.070 --> 00:55:03.420 align:middle line:84%
ego is what's created the
planetary emergency we

00:55:03.420 --> 00:55:04.220 align:middle line:90%
have now.

00:55:04.220 --> 00:55:06.960 align:middle line:84%
It's created the catastrophe of
all the isms and the structures

00:55:06.960 --> 00:55:07.760 align:middle line:90%
we've done.

00:55:07.760 --> 00:55:09.070 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: The frontals
has done that.

00:55:09.070 --> 00:55:11.528 align:middle line:84%
>>RAZAM: And so when the ego
fully goes down, what is left?

00:55:11.528 --> 00:55:12.697 align:middle line:90%
It's the brain at large.

00:55:12.697 --> 00:55:14.530 align:middle line:84%
And the brain at large
or the mind at large,

00:55:14.530 --> 00:55:18.980 align:middle line:84%
as Aldous Huxley said, it
gets full spectrum signal

00:55:18.980 --> 00:55:21.170 align:middle line:90%
like 10 bar signal.

00:55:21.170 --> 00:55:22.510 align:middle line:90%
And that's all there is.

00:55:22.510 --> 00:55:25.960 align:middle line:84%
But the cumulative effects
after the peak experience

00:55:25.960 --> 00:55:29.736 align:middle line:84%
are both cohesion between
left and right hemispheres

00:55:29.736 --> 00:55:34.130 align:middle line:84%
of the brain,
increased optimization,

00:55:34.130 --> 00:55:36.990 align:middle line:84%
but also, some very
interesting things.

00:55:36.990 --> 00:55:39.670 align:middle line:84%
We have alpha beta gamma
delta states of mind,

00:55:39.670 --> 00:55:43.340 align:middle line:84%
and so beta's problem-solving,
alpha is like alienating.

00:55:43.340 --> 00:55:45.800 align:middle line:84%
Theta and delta are getting
two more mystical dreamlike

00:55:45.800 --> 00:55:46.820 align:middle line:90%
or altered states.

00:55:46.820 --> 00:55:47.600 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And then
there's gamma,

00:55:47.600 --> 00:55:49.040 align:middle line:90%
which the Tibetan monks reach.

00:55:49.040 --> 00:55:50.165 align:middle line:90%
>>RAZAM: This is the thing.

00:55:50.165 --> 00:55:52.310 align:middle line:84%
So gamma is cohesion,
and gamma's only

00:55:52.310 --> 00:55:55.190 align:middle line:84%
been able to be identified
in the last 20 years

00:55:55.190 --> 00:55:57.360 align:middle line:84%
as the precision of the
equipment's gotten better.

00:55:57.360 --> 00:55:58.830 align:middle line:90%
So it's some sense of cohesion.

00:55:58.830 --> 00:56:02.300 align:middle line:84%
So gamma seems to be
the alpha, and then this

00:56:02.300 --> 00:56:04.679 align:middle line:84%
is only in some of
our preliminary data.

00:56:04.679 --> 00:56:06.220 align:middle line:84%
So we can't take it
across the board.

00:56:06.220 --> 00:56:08.830 align:middle line:84%
It's still to be peer reviewed,
which we're aiming towards,

00:56:08.830 --> 00:56:10.246 align:middle line:84%
and we're looking
for more funding

00:56:10.246 --> 00:56:11.710 align:middle line:90%
to do this neuroscience work.

00:56:11.710 --> 00:56:15.580 align:middle line:84%
But it seems to be, it's
almost as if alpha and theta go

00:56:15.580 --> 00:56:19.060 align:middle line:84%
into cohesion as
well, and gamma,

00:56:19.060 --> 00:56:21.310 align:middle line:84%
which normally lasts
for milliseconds,

00:56:21.310 --> 00:56:23.950 align:middle line:84%
goes into cohesion for
like minutes at a time.

00:56:23.950 --> 00:56:26.530 align:middle line:90%
And it creates a unity state.

00:56:26.530 --> 00:56:27.960 align:middle line:90%
And we don't really know.

00:56:27.960 --> 00:56:29.082 align:middle line:84%
We haven't got the hard
science on this yet.

00:56:29.082 --> 00:56:30.660 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: But they have
measured Tibetan monks

00:56:30.660 --> 00:56:31.800 align:middle line:90%
that are lifelong meditators.

00:56:31.800 --> 00:56:32.180 align:middle line:90%
>>RAZAM: And they go into gamma.

00:56:32.180 --> 00:56:33.170 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: They go into gamma.

00:56:33.170 --> 00:56:34.930 align:middle line:84%
>>RAZAM: And so I've
been working with getting

00:56:34.930 --> 00:56:36.100 align:middle line:90%
into the toad medicine now.

00:56:36.100 --> 00:56:39.850 align:middle line:84%
So I was working with ayahuasca
for seven, eight years,

00:56:39.850 --> 00:56:42.490 align:middle line:84%
and then integrating
my experiences

00:56:42.490 --> 00:56:44.365 align:middle line:84%
into the book and
the film, "Aya--

00:56:44.365 --> 00:56:46.870 align:middle line:84%
Awakenings," which is
on the Gaia catalog.

00:56:46.870 --> 00:56:49.390 align:middle line:84%
And then at the
apex of that, when

00:56:49.390 --> 00:56:52.150 align:middle line:84%
it was like that
spiritual path of holding

00:56:52.150 --> 00:56:56.410 align:middle line:84%
that space for that story,
when that was finished,

00:56:56.410 --> 00:56:59.530 align:middle line:84%
within nine months, I
then started to-- well,

00:56:59.530 --> 00:57:02.110 align:middle line:84%
I was introduced to Dr.
Octavio Rettig, who's

00:57:02.110 --> 00:57:04.940 align:middle line:84%
a Mexican doctor, who works
with the Sonoran Desert toad,

00:57:04.940 --> 00:57:08.260 align:middle line:84%
the bufo alvarius toad, which
contains 5-MEO-DMT, which

00:57:08.260 --> 00:57:12.730 align:middle line:84%
is the same material in an
organic extract from the toad,

00:57:12.730 --> 00:57:15.310 align:middle line:84%
which is what I had in 2006,
which you see in the film.

00:57:15.310 --> 00:57:17.110 align:middle line:84%
We're talking about
this deep experience.

00:57:17.110 --> 00:57:19.380 align:middle line:84%
So I'm really
putting it together

00:57:19.380 --> 00:57:23.200 align:middle line:84%
and understand there's
no coincidence in this.

00:57:23.200 --> 00:57:26.050 align:middle line:84%
As I started to have the
experience of 5-MEO-DMT

00:57:26.050 --> 00:57:29.299 align:middle line:84%
from the bufo
alvarius toad, and I

00:57:29.299 --> 00:57:31.090 align:middle line:84%
wasn't running to go
back there, because it

00:57:31.090 --> 00:57:33.310 align:middle line:84%
was such an
all-encompassing, ego

00:57:33.310 --> 00:57:35.890 align:middle line:84%
deaf unification
with great source

00:57:35.890 --> 00:57:38.200 align:middle line:90%
that I was just like mindblown.

00:57:38.200 --> 00:57:41.140 align:middle line:90%
And it took a lot to integrate.

00:57:41.140 --> 00:57:43.979 align:middle line:84%
But then I started to see
that this medicine-- not just

00:57:43.979 --> 00:57:46.270 align:middle line:84%
ayahuasca, but there's many
different plant entheogens.

00:57:46.270 --> 00:57:49.510 align:middle line:84%
As I said, the idea of the
ceremony and the structure

00:57:49.510 --> 00:57:51.460 align:middle line:84%
and the ritual has been
coming out to the West

00:57:51.460 --> 00:57:52.570 align:middle line:90%
alongside ayahuasca.

00:57:52.570 --> 00:57:54.780 align:middle line:84%
So people just see
ayahuasca, but this ceremony

00:57:54.780 --> 00:57:56.810 align:middle line:84%
and the ayahuasca
circles and the ritual

00:57:56.810 --> 00:57:59.620 align:middle line:84%
and the songs and the
connection between the planet

00:57:59.620 --> 00:58:01.270 align:middle line:84%
and the indigenous
cultures and now

00:58:01.270 --> 00:58:03.790 align:middle line:84%
this modern wave of
shamanism, as we document

00:58:03.790 --> 00:58:05.200 align:middle line:90%
shamans and global village.

00:58:05.200 --> 00:58:07.642 align:middle line:84%
So I worked with
Dr. Octavio Rettig,

00:58:07.642 --> 00:58:09.850 align:middle line:84%
and we're working with the
Sonoran Desert toad, which

00:58:09.850 --> 00:58:14.820 align:middle line:84%
is a smokeable 5-MEO-DMT, again,
from the toad, fully organic,

00:58:14.820 --> 00:58:16.990 align:middle line:84%
and you go back into
these 5-MEO states.

00:58:16.990 --> 00:58:20.490 align:middle line:90%
And is all I can say.

00:58:20.490 --> 00:58:24.810 align:middle line:84%
I mean you go to these states
of unity consciousness, which

00:58:24.810 --> 00:58:27.420 align:middle line:84%
are both incredibly
profound and healing.

00:58:27.420 --> 00:58:30.120 align:middle line:84%
And as we know a bit of
the science into gamma

00:58:30.120 --> 00:58:33.750 align:middle line:84%
and into cohesion, and it feels
to me when the ego flatlines--

00:58:33.750 --> 00:58:37.080 align:middle line:84%
this is my conjecture from the
science we've been getting--

00:58:37.080 --> 00:58:40.395 align:middle line:84%
is that the network of
the brain goes down.

00:58:40.395 --> 00:58:43.500 align:middle line:84%
The fully frontal lobe goes
down, and what remains?

00:58:43.500 --> 00:58:46.320 align:middle line:84%
What remains of the other
brains, the three brains

00:58:46.320 --> 00:58:47.160 align:middle line:90%
that we have--

00:58:47.160 --> 00:58:50.850 align:middle line:84%
the stomach brain with the
microbacteria and the instinct,

00:58:50.850 --> 00:58:52.800 align:middle line:84%
and the heart with
the neuronal cells.

00:58:52.800 --> 00:58:55.380 align:middle line:84%
The older networks
we had before, we

00:58:55.380 --> 00:58:58.080 align:middle line:84%
came into egoic
consciousness, remain

00:58:58.080 --> 00:59:00.090 align:middle line:84%
to pick up the
full spectrum unity

00:59:00.090 --> 00:59:02.370 align:middle line:90%
state of the 5-MEO experience.

00:59:02.370 --> 00:59:08.610 align:middle line:84%
And in that state, there is
the most enormous information

00:59:08.610 --> 00:59:13.080 align:middle line:84%
reservoir and
loving intelligence.

00:59:13.080 --> 00:59:15.090 align:middle line:90%
And this is Nick Cave's song.

00:59:15.090 --> 00:59:17.624 align:middle line:84%
It's like I don't believe
in an interventionist god.

00:59:17.624 --> 00:59:18.540 align:middle line:90%
I mean think about it.

00:59:18.540 --> 00:59:21.630 align:middle line:84%
All through history, the
mystics spent all their time

00:59:21.630 --> 00:59:24.630 align:middle line:84%
connecting to God, and to
go up into a Samadhi state

00:59:24.630 --> 00:59:27.210 align:middle line:84%
and to realize the oneness
and unity of everything.

00:59:27.210 --> 00:59:29.400 align:middle line:84%
And when you get
there, you realize

00:59:29.400 --> 00:59:32.220 align:middle line:84%
that God spends all its
time to come down here

00:59:32.220 --> 00:59:34.790 align:middle line:84%
and to incarnate as
manifestation in the world.

00:59:34.790 --> 00:59:36.210 align:middle line:90%
It's this two-way street.

00:59:36.210 --> 00:59:39.060 align:middle line:84%
So it's crazy, but
those pathways,

00:59:39.060 --> 00:59:42.660 align:middle line:84%
once they're awakened,
really remain awakened,

00:59:42.660 --> 00:59:45.150 align:middle line:84%
because we can obfuscate
them, and they're still

00:59:45.150 --> 00:59:46.327 align:middle line:90%
filtered by the ego.

00:59:46.327 --> 00:59:48.660 align:middle line:84%
But I feel that the difference--
and we're talking about

00:59:48.660 --> 00:59:51.750 align:middle line:84%
the psychedelic revolution
and the shamanic resurgence--

00:59:51.750 --> 00:59:53.430 align:middle line:84%
I really feel that's
a stepping stone

00:59:53.430 --> 00:59:55.530 align:middle line:84%
from planetary
Gaian intelligence

00:59:55.530 --> 00:59:58.680 align:middle line:84%
and behind planetary Gaian
intelligence, deep source,

00:59:58.680 --> 01:00:02.220 align:middle line:84%
in training us to be
ready for full spectrum

01:00:02.220 --> 01:00:05.225 align:middle line:84%
consciousness, which we
have had in the dream time,

01:00:05.225 --> 01:00:08.160 align:middle line:84%
as the Aboriginal Australians
say, in these different world

01:00:08.160 --> 01:00:09.180 align:middle line:90%
ages before.

01:00:09.180 --> 01:00:12.030 align:middle line:84%
So we've had to have the
psychedelic experience come out

01:00:12.030 --> 01:00:14.730 align:middle line:84%
of the labs, because we were
so distanced from the garden

01:00:14.730 --> 01:00:18.570 align:middle line:84%
and from indigenous cultures
that William Burroughs ran

01:00:18.570 --> 01:00:20.240 align:middle line:84%
screaming from the
ayahuasca experience

01:00:20.240 --> 01:00:22.800 align:middle line:84%
back in the 1950s, because
he wasn't ready for it.

01:00:22.800 --> 01:00:25.020 align:middle line:84%
And white picket
fence America wasn't

01:00:25.020 --> 01:00:27.700 align:middle line:84%
ready for the jungle and
the entheogenic experience.

01:00:27.700 --> 01:00:29.550 align:middle line:84%
But we had to go
through the '60s

01:00:29.550 --> 01:00:31.320 align:middle line:84%
and the psychedelic
experience stretching

01:00:31.320 --> 01:00:33.120 align:middle line:84%
our minds and the
psychic lubricant,

01:00:33.120 --> 01:00:35.760 align:middle line:84%
and then the ecstasy revolution,
and then the plant medicine

01:00:35.760 --> 01:00:38.070 align:middle line:84%
renaissance to be
ready for the light,

01:00:38.070 --> 01:00:41.550 align:middle line:84%
for the 5-MEO-DMT, which
is endogenous and is in us.

01:00:41.550 --> 01:00:44.640 align:middle line:84%
We are the medicine that
the planet is revealing.

01:00:44.640 --> 01:00:47.010 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And it's only
revealing us to us, really,

01:00:47.010 --> 01:00:49.710 align:middle line:84%
the highest aspect of what
we are and expressed out

01:00:49.710 --> 01:00:50.805 align:middle line:90%
into the cosmos.

01:00:50.805 --> 01:00:51.721 align:middle line:90%
It's connected to all.

01:00:51.721 --> 01:00:54.420 align:middle line:84%
>>RAZAM: Each of the species
are playing a role in the Gaian

01:00:54.420 --> 01:00:57.230 align:middle line:84%
matrix within the hole,
and I think it's--

01:00:57.230 --> 01:00:59.380 align:middle line:84%
I call it the orgasm
of the species.

01:00:59.380 --> 01:01:00.850 align:middle line:90%
There's a peak moment.

01:01:00.850 --> 01:01:02.345 align:middle line:90%
I think we're coming up to this.

01:01:02.345 --> 01:01:03.720 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So let
me ask you this.

01:01:03.720 --> 01:01:06.870 align:middle line:84%
Has anyone on any
of these experiences

01:01:06.870 --> 01:01:09.980 align:middle line:84%
come upon, while they're under
the influence, so to speak,

01:01:09.980 --> 01:01:13.080 align:middle line:84%
and in the experience,
come upon the experience

01:01:13.080 --> 01:01:16.680 align:middle line:84%
of a punishing god reading
off lists of commandments

01:01:16.680 --> 01:01:18.300 align:middle line:90%
and so forth to them?

01:01:18.300 --> 01:01:20.690 align:middle line:84%
>>RAZAM: If that's their
imprint, go for it.

01:01:20.690 --> 01:01:21.990 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: I just wanted to see.

01:01:21.990 --> 01:01:24.700 align:middle line:84%
But that's not usually what's
going to happen, right?

01:01:24.700 --> 01:01:26.533 align:middle line:84%
>>RAZAM: What you believe
to be true becomes

01:01:26.533 --> 01:01:28.234 align:middle line:90%
true to a certain degree.

01:01:28.234 --> 01:01:29.900 align:middle line:84%
Joseph Campbell called
them all the mass

01:01:29.900 --> 01:01:32.580 align:middle line:84%
of God, and all the different
religious structures--

01:01:32.580 --> 01:01:34.080 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So
essentially, are people

01:01:34.080 --> 01:01:35.580 align:middle line:84%
then just-- they're
experiencing what

01:01:35.580 --> 01:01:37.663 align:middle line:84%
they expect to experience
through the lens of what

01:01:37.663 --> 01:01:38.940 align:middle line:90%
their own belief systems are?

01:01:38.940 --> 01:01:39.780 align:middle line:84%
>>RAZAM: There's two
components there.

01:01:39.780 --> 01:01:41.821 align:middle line:84%
Joseph Campbell had that
[INAUDIBLE] mass of God,

01:01:41.821 --> 01:01:43.800 align:middle line:84%
but Jung had the
idea of you've got

01:01:43.800 --> 01:01:45.840 align:middle line:84%
your consciousness
and your day residues

01:01:45.840 --> 01:01:47.885 align:middle line:84%
and then, perhaps, the
collective unconscious,

01:01:47.885 --> 01:01:50.010 align:middle line:84%
and then I think we have
like a species unconscious

01:01:50.010 --> 01:01:51.300 align:middle line:90%
and Gaian unconscious.

01:01:51.300 --> 01:01:53.340 align:middle line:10%
And there's different
chambers of drawing

01:01:53.340 --> 01:01:56.470 align:middle line:10%
upon different potentials
of information and energy

01:01:56.470 --> 01:01:57.270 align:middle line:10%
exchange.

01:01:57.270 --> 01:01:58.853 align:middle line:10%
So I think a lot of
people go through,

01:01:58.853 --> 01:02:00.140 align:middle line:10%
I've seen Jesus in ayahuasca.

01:02:00.140 --> 01:02:00.940 align:middle line:10%
He's my brother.

01:02:00.940 --> 01:02:04.710 align:middle line:10%
But he looked like 1970s
Jesus wearing flip-flops.

01:02:04.710 --> 01:02:07.320 align:middle line:84%
It feels like the
consciousness of ayahuasca

01:02:07.320 --> 01:02:09.720 align:middle line:84%
reads your data banks
and your culture banks,

01:02:09.720 --> 01:02:12.060 align:middle line:84%
and if it wants to help
invoke a loving situation,

01:02:12.060 --> 01:02:13.710 align:middle line:84%
it might draw upon
that archetype.

01:02:13.710 --> 01:02:17.160 align:middle line:84%
And if you need to experience
a vengeful Yahweh-type of God

01:02:17.160 --> 01:02:18.631 align:middle line:90%
scenario, OK.

01:02:18.631 --> 01:02:20.880 align:middle line:84%
But hopefully, it'll be done
in the context of letting

01:02:20.880 --> 01:02:23.760 align:middle line:84%
go of that and of healing and of
realizing that, then, oh, look,

01:02:23.760 --> 01:02:24.780 align:middle line:90%
you let go of that.

01:02:24.780 --> 01:02:25.590 align:middle line:90%
The clouds part.

01:02:25.590 --> 01:02:27.210 align:middle line:84%
The sun shines
through, and then you

01:02:27.210 --> 01:02:28.584 align:middle line:84%
might understand
there's a deeper

01:02:28.584 --> 01:02:30.540 align:middle line:90%
capacity to consciousness.

01:02:30.540 --> 01:02:33.060 align:middle line:10%
You get what you need,
but also, it doesn't stop.

01:02:33.060 --> 01:02:36.090 align:middle line:10%
We're all being entrained,
and it gives us as much

01:02:36.090 --> 01:02:38.520 align:middle line:10%
as you can handle for as
much as you can handle.

01:02:38.520 --> 01:02:40.760 align:middle line:90%
It stretches you each time.

01:02:40.760 --> 01:02:42.690 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: On that note,
we're out of time.

01:02:42.690 --> 01:02:43.800 align:middle line:90%
One final comment?

01:02:43.800 --> 01:02:46.080 align:middle line:84%
Anything you'd like to say
before I sign off here?

01:02:46.080 --> 01:02:47.407 align:middle line:90%
>>RAZAM: Love is all there is.

01:02:47.407 --> 01:02:48.990 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Everything
else is illusion.

01:02:48.990 --> 01:02:50.970 align:middle line:84%
I think that was one
of David Icke's titles.

01:02:50.970 --> 01:02:52.044 align:middle line:90%
>>RAZAM: There you go.

01:02:52.044 --> 01:02:53.460 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: You're
absolutely right.

01:02:53.460 --> 01:02:55.110 align:middle line:90%
That's my experience too.

01:02:55.110 --> 01:02:55.990 align:middle line:90%
Thank you so much.

01:02:55.990 --> 01:02:58.890 align:middle line:84%
And good luck on all of your
research and upcoming projects.

01:02:58.890 --> 01:02:59.690 align:middle line:90%
>>RAZAM: Thank you.

01:02:59.690 --> 01:03:00.917 align:middle line:90%
Aloha.

01:03:00.917 --> 01:03:03.000 align:middle line:10%
>>REGINA: Again, the title
of the films are "Aya--

01:03:03.000 --> 01:03:05.490 align:middle line:10%
Awakenings" and "Shamans
of the Global Village"

01:03:05.490 --> 01:03:06.814 align:middle line:10%
here in the Gaia library.

01:03:06.814 --> 01:03:08.730 align:middle line:10%
Until next time, thank
you for joining us here

01:03:08.730 --> 01:03:10.730 align:middle line:10%
on "Open Minds."
