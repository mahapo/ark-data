00:00:18.595 --> 00:00:20.470 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA MEREDITH: It's
our greatest pleasure

00:00:20.470 --> 00:00:22.780 align:middle line:84%
to have Andrew Harvey
back with us today.

00:00:22.780 --> 00:00:25.700 align:middle line:10%
We've discussed radical
passion and the transformation

00:00:25.700 --> 00:00:27.810 align:middle line:10%
of Christianity back
to its mystical roots

00:00:27.810 --> 00:00:29.530 align:middle line:10%
in our past conversations.

00:00:29.530 --> 00:00:31.270 align:middle line:10%
Today, Andrew is
going to walk us

00:00:31.270 --> 00:00:33.650 align:middle line:10%
through the topic
of love and action.

00:00:33.650 --> 00:00:35.740 align:middle line:84%
To sit in meditation
and feel the love

00:00:35.740 --> 00:00:37.850 align:middle line:84%
is beautiful and
transformational,

00:00:37.850 --> 00:00:40.455 align:middle line:84%
but Andrew believes it
isn't enough in a world that

00:00:40.455 --> 00:00:42.210 align:middle line:90%
is fighting to hold its light.

00:00:42.210 --> 00:00:46.330 align:middle line:84%
He says we need to use our love
and passion in an active way

00:00:46.330 --> 00:00:49.050 align:middle line:84%
to create the new
world we all dream of.

00:00:49.050 --> 00:00:50.680 align:middle line:90%
And welcome back once again.

00:00:50.680 --> 00:00:52.138 align:middle line:84%
>>ANDREW HARVEY:
Lovely to be here.

00:00:52.138 --> 00:00:53.655 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Just my favorite ever.

00:00:53.655 --> 00:00:56.929 align:middle line:84%
In past conversations, we've
really kept a lot of light

00:00:56.929 --> 00:00:57.720 align:middle line:90%
in the discussions.

00:00:57.720 --> 00:00:58.440 align:middle line:90%
>>HARVEY: Yes.

00:00:58.440 --> 00:01:01.360 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And it's really been
of a transformative nature.

00:01:01.360 --> 00:01:03.390 align:middle line:84%
In this particular
conversation, we're

00:01:03.390 --> 00:01:05.610 align:middle line:84%
going to have to knock
it down a little bit

00:01:05.610 --> 00:01:09.120 align:middle line:84%
and go into the reason
we need to become

00:01:09.120 --> 00:01:12.250 align:middle line:84%
active in the
transformation process,

00:01:12.250 --> 00:01:14.790 align:middle line:84%
not just personally, but
for the planet at large.

00:01:14.790 --> 00:01:16.380 align:middle line:90%
And it isn't a New Age concept.

00:01:16.380 --> 00:01:17.610 align:middle line:90%
There's a reason for it.

00:01:17.610 --> 00:01:18.360 align:middle line:90%
>>HARVEY: Oh, god.

00:01:18.360 --> 00:01:23.320 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And you've been driven
by this haunting, deep belief

00:01:23.320 --> 00:01:28.320 align:middle line:84%
that we are in a horrible
crisis, beyond what many others

00:01:28.320 --> 00:01:29.127 align:middle line:90%
would even suggest.

00:01:29.127 --> 00:01:29.710 align:middle line:90%
>>HARVEY: Yes.

00:01:29.710 --> 00:01:32.168 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And I would like you
to speak to that for however

00:01:32.168 --> 00:01:35.251 align:middle line:84%
long it takes, to share your
version of what this world is

00:01:35.251 --> 00:01:36.250 align:middle line:90%
going through right now.

00:01:36.250 --> 00:01:39.310 align:middle line:84%
It is, on many
levels, a dark moment.

00:01:39.310 --> 00:01:41.880 align:middle line:90%


00:01:41.880 --> 00:01:47.520 align:middle line:84%
>>HARVEY: Well, I
believe three things.

00:01:47.520 --> 00:01:53.180 align:middle line:84%
I believe that we are in an
immense evolutionary crisis

00:01:53.180 --> 00:01:56.020 align:middle line:84%
and that our
consciousness is not

00:01:56.020 --> 00:02:00.140 align:middle line:84%
up to the level of the
problems that we've created.

00:02:00.140 --> 00:02:02.540 align:middle line:84%
That's the first
thing I believe.

00:02:02.540 --> 00:02:05.670 align:middle line:84%
The second thing I believe
is that this crisis

00:02:05.670 --> 00:02:09.580 align:middle line:90%
has two fundamental faces.

00:02:09.580 --> 00:02:13.580 align:middle line:84%
One face, which we
have to look into

00:02:13.580 --> 00:02:17.470 align:middle line:84%
and we have to be able to
be brave enough to see,

00:02:17.470 --> 00:02:21.870 align:middle line:84%
is the face of what I
call the "Great Death."

00:02:21.870 --> 00:02:24.480 align:middle line:84%
And this terrifying,
menacing death

00:02:24.480 --> 00:02:28.550 align:middle line:84%
is happening on
every single level.

00:02:28.550 --> 00:02:31.390 align:middle line:90%
The environment is in free-fall.

00:02:31.390 --> 00:02:35.200 align:middle line:84%
Three billion people are
living on less than $1 a day.

00:02:35.200 --> 00:02:39.350 align:middle line:90%
90% of the seas are polluted.

00:02:39.350 --> 00:02:44.470 align:middle line:84%
120 species are vanishing
every single day.

00:02:44.470 --> 00:02:49.550 align:middle line:84%
We have in place an absolutely
ruthless, insane form

00:02:49.550 --> 00:02:50.830 align:middle line:90%
of capitalism.

00:02:50.830 --> 00:02:55.410 align:middle line:84%
Just this morning, I read that
CEOs are making even more money

00:02:55.410 --> 00:02:59.280 align:middle line:84%
than ever, paying each other
even more fabulous bonuses

00:02:59.280 --> 00:03:01.680 align:middle line:84%
at a time when the
world is groaning

00:03:01.680 --> 00:03:03.830 align:middle line:90%
in misery and heartbreak.

00:03:03.830 --> 00:03:06.380 align:middle line:90%
We have to face this death.

00:03:06.380 --> 00:03:10.120 align:middle line:84%
Many people in the New Age say
if you look at the negative,

00:03:10.120 --> 00:03:12.150 align:middle line:90%
you'll make it more negative.

00:03:12.150 --> 00:03:15.500 align:middle line:90%
This is horse shit.

00:03:15.500 --> 00:03:18.020 align:middle line:84%
It's as if you
were to have cancer

00:03:18.020 --> 00:03:21.190 align:middle line:84%
and your doctor was to tell
you, oh, no, don't worry.

00:03:21.190 --> 00:03:22.390 align:middle line:90%
You only have a cold.

00:03:22.390 --> 00:03:23.780 align:middle line:90%
Here is an aspirin.

00:03:23.780 --> 00:03:25.430 align:middle line:84%
You'd sack that
doctor, wouldn't you,

00:03:25.430 --> 00:03:27.020 align:middle line:90%
when you found out the truth?

00:03:27.020 --> 00:03:30.170 align:middle line:84%
We cannot go through what we
have to go through until we

00:03:30.170 --> 00:03:34.100 align:middle line:84%
face the consequences of what
we've created from our mad

00:03:34.100 --> 00:03:37.670 align:middle line:84%
hubris of exploitation and
domination and narcissism

00:03:37.670 --> 00:03:39.090 align:middle line:90%
and selfishness.

00:03:39.090 --> 00:03:42.300 align:middle line:84%
We have brought
ourselves to a crisis

00:03:42.300 --> 00:03:45.560 align:middle line:84%
in which the whole future of
the human race is at stake

00:03:45.560 --> 00:03:47.950 align:middle line:90%
and a great deal of nature.

00:03:47.950 --> 00:03:51.040 align:middle line:84%
If that was all
that was happening,

00:03:51.040 --> 00:03:53.230 align:middle line:84%
I would suggest to
everybody listening

00:03:53.230 --> 00:03:58.580 align:middle line:84%
that they made some James
Jones Kool-Aid, sung "Kumbaya"

00:03:58.580 --> 00:04:01.350 align:middle line:84%
or "I will Overcome,"
for the last time,

00:04:01.350 --> 00:04:05.600 align:middle line:84%
and lie down and die, preferably
under a friendly truck which

00:04:05.600 --> 00:04:06.406 align:middle line:90%
would make it fast.

00:04:06.406 --> 00:04:07.156 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: [LAUGHS]

00:04:07.156 --> 00:04:09.280 align:middle line:84%
>>HARVEY: But that's not
all that's happening.

00:04:09.280 --> 00:04:12.290 align:middle line:84%
What I have come to
understand from the deepest

00:04:12.290 --> 00:04:17.170 align:middle line:84%
inner experience is that
this Great Death is actually

00:04:17.170 --> 00:04:20.529 align:middle line:84%
the crucible for a
tremendous birth.

00:04:20.529 --> 00:04:23.370 align:middle line:84%
And that birth is also
taking place on the planet.

00:04:23.370 --> 00:04:25.860 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: But isn't this the
nature of all cycles of life?

00:04:25.860 --> 00:04:27.020 align:middle line:90%
>>HARVEY: Yes.

00:04:27.020 --> 00:04:31.570 align:middle line:84%
The world, the universe,
is a dance of opposites.

00:04:31.570 --> 00:04:37.700 align:middle line:84%
And what we're now seeing is
the complete, ferocious, amazing

00:04:37.700 --> 00:04:41.680 align:middle line:84%
dance of the divine, an
extreme opposite of death

00:04:41.680 --> 00:04:44.860 align:middle line:84%
and the other extreme opposite
of a birth, which is absolutely

00:04:44.860 --> 00:04:47.170 align:middle line:84%
unprecedented, a birth of
wholly new possibilities

00:04:47.170 --> 00:04:49.010 align:middle line:84%
in technology-- which,
if we turn to them,

00:04:49.010 --> 00:04:51.830 align:middle line:84%
could save us-- new
sources of energy;

00:04:51.830 --> 00:04:53.860 align:middle line:84%
a birth of wholly
new forms of business

00:04:53.860 --> 00:04:58.300 align:middle line:84%
and economics, which are being
worked out by brilliant people;

00:04:58.300 --> 00:05:00.390 align:middle line:84%
a birth of a
mystical renaissance,

00:05:00.390 --> 00:05:03.620 align:middle line:84%
saturated with the vision
of the motherhood of God;

00:05:03.620 --> 00:05:05.965 align:middle line:84%
where all the treasures of
all the mystical systems

00:05:05.965 --> 00:05:08.090 align:middle line:84%
are available to us and
all the sacred technologies

00:05:08.090 --> 00:05:10.670 align:middle line:84%
of sacred practice
are available to us.

00:05:10.670 --> 00:05:13.490 align:middle line:90%
We're at a moment of crossroads.

00:05:13.490 --> 00:05:17.690 align:middle line:84%
Which will we choose,
the insanity of power

00:05:17.690 --> 00:05:21.770 align:middle line:90%
or the divine insanity of love?

00:05:21.770 --> 00:05:25.890 align:middle line:84%
And the third thing I believe is
that there is a force on Earth

00:05:25.890 --> 00:05:31.250 align:middle line:84%
right now, being born in great
intensity, which could not only

00:05:31.250 --> 00:05:33.760 align:middle line:84%
save us from the dereliction
that threatens us,

00:05:33.760 --> 00:05:36.550 align:middle line:84%
but actually help us birth
a new kind of humanity

00:05:36.550 --> 00:05:37.470 align:middle line:90%
and a new world.

00:05:37.470 --> 00:05:40.310 align:middle line:84%
And that force is what I've
called "Sacred Activism."

00:05:40.310 --> 00:05:43.970 align:middle line:84%
It's the force of
divine love in action.

00:05:43.970 --> 00:05:47.690 align:middle line:84%
And there are two ways that
I define sacred activism.

00:05:47.690 --> 00:05:50.390 align:middle line:84%
The first is the
user friendly, not

00:05:50.390 --> 00:05:54.766 align:middle line:84%
too threatening way, which
I use when I must by CNN

00:05:54.766 --> 00:05:56.015 align:middle line:90%
or something to explain this--

00:05:56.015 --> 00:05:56.950 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Yes, the
polite version.

00:05:56.950 --> 00:05:59.350 align:middle line:84%
>>HARVEY: --the mild way,
the polite version-- and that

00:05:59.350 --> 00:06:05.100 align:middle line:84%
is that, when you combine a
deep spiritual understanding

00:06:05.100 --> 00:06:08.890 align:middle line:84%
with a commitment to
justice, a holy force

00:06:08.890 --> 00:06:11.240 align:middle line:84%
is borne which can,
over time, transform

00:06:11.240 --> 00:06:13.480 align:middle line:90%
the most insoluble problems.

00:06:13.480 --> 00:06:15.950 align:middle line:90%
And we've seen this in Gandhi.

00:06:15.950 --> 00:06:19.030 align:middle line:84%
We've seen this in
Martin Luther King.

00:06:19.030 --> 00:06:21.340 align:middle line:90%
We've seen this in Leck Walesa.

00:06:21.340 --> 00:06:22.750 align:middle line:90%
We've seen this in Desmond Tutu.

00:06:22.750 --> 00:06:26.340 align:middle line:84%
We see this now on the stage
of the world in Aung San Suu

00:06:26.340 --> 00:06:30.900 align:middle line:84%
Kyi, someone who has held
fast to her spiritual vision

00:06:30.900 --> 00:06:33.250 align:middle line:84%
but is also affecting a
political and economic

00:06:33.250 --> 00:06:36.260 align:middle line:84%
transformation in
her own country.

00:06:36.260 --> 00:06:39.910 align:middle line:84%
That's the first
explanation and definition.

00:06:39.910 --> 00:06:42.730 align:middle line:84%
The second definition
goes deeper for me,

00:06:42.730 --> 00:06:48.200 align:middle line:84%
because it points to how
evolutionary this power is.

00:06:48.200 --> 00:06:50.980 align:middle line:10%
When I was writing my
book, "The Hope," trying

00:06:50.980 --> 00:06:53.840 align:middle line:10%
to give the whole roadmap
to sacred activism,

00:06:53.840 --> 00:06:57.340 align:middle line:10%
how to be a sacred
activist, how to enact it,

00:06:57.340 --> 00:07:02.040 align:middle line:10%
I begged God-- actually, I
begged Jesus-- for a vision.

00:07:02.040 --> 00:07:05.930 align:middle line:84%
Because my work has always
progressed by deep thought,

00:07:05.930 --> 00:07:07.590 align:middle line:84%
but also by
visionary experience,

00:07:07.590 --> 00:07:09.650 align:middle line:90%
like all other visionaries.

00:07:09.650 --> 00:07:15.150 align:middle line:84%
And I had this vision of
two rivers of fire racing

00:07:15.150 --> 00:07:20.890 align:middle line:84%
towards the sea and meeting in
this immense nuclear explosion.

00:07:20.890 --> 00:07:22.870 align:middle line:84%
But it wasn't a
destructive explosion.

00:07:22.870 --> 00:07:27.340 align:middle line:90%
It was an explosion of power!

00:07:27.340 --> 00:07:32.840 align:middle line:84%
And as I watched this
revelation, I heard the words,

00:07:32.840 --> 00:07:38.230 align:middle line:84%
"when the river of the fire of
the mystic's passion for God

00:07:38.230 --> 00:07:42.510 align:middle line:84%
is united with the river of
the fire of the activist's

00:07:42.510 --> 00:07:46.970 align:middle line:84%
passion for justice,
a third fire

00:07:46.970 --> 00:07:51.660 align:middle line:84%
is created, which is a
quantum leap of power."

00:07:51.660 --> 00:07:56.270 align:middle line:84%
And I remembered, when I was
awoken from this vision, two

00:07:56.270 --> 00:07:58.820 align:middle line:84%
great texts, which I've
loved for a long time

00:07:58.820 --> 00:08:02.760 align:middle line:84%
but which, suddenly, became
absolutely clear to me.

00:08:02.760 --> 00:08:05.440 align:middle line:84%
The first was from
Teilhard de Chardin.

00:08:05.440 --> 00:08:07.860 align:middle line:84%
And Teilhard de Chardin, the
great, evolutionary Christian

00:08:07.860 --> 00:08:13.500 align:middle line:84%
mystic wrote, "Someday,
after we have mastered

00:08:13.500 --> 00:08:20.430 align:middle line:84%
the tides and gravity, we shall
harness the energies of love."

00:08:20.430 --> 00:08:22.750 align:middle line:90%
Harness the energies of love.

00:08:22.750 --> 00:08:26.330 align:middle line:84%
"And then, for the second time
in the history of humanity,

00:08:26.330 --> 00:08:30.790 align:middle line:84%
humanity will have
discovered fire."

00:08:30.790 --> 00:08:33.724 align:middle line:84%
And the second text-- and
we'll go into that one.

00:08:33.724 --> 00:08:37.530 align:middle line:84%
Let me just finish my-- because
this is such a gorgeous text.

00:08:37.530 --> 00:08:39.539 align:middle line:84%
And this is the
real key, I think.

00:08:39.539 --> 00:08:41.500 align:middle line:90%
It comes from Rumi.

00:08:41.500 --> 00:08:52.970 align:middle line:84%
He says, "Passion burns down
every branch of exhaustion.

00:08:52.970 --> 00:08:58.480 align:middle line:84%
Passion is the supreme
elixir and renews all things.

00:08:58.480 --> 00:09:00.480 align:middle line:84%
So don't sigh heavily,
your brow bleak

00:09:00.480 --> 00:09:02.410 align:middle line:90%
with cynicism and boredom.

00:09:02.410 --> 00:09:06.230 align:middle line:84%
Dare to look for passion,
passion, passion, passion.

00:09:06.230 --> 00:09:10.080 align:middle line:84%
Run far away, my friends,
from all false solutions.

00:09:10.080 --> 00:09:16.030 align:middle line:84%
Let divine passion triumph
and rebirth you in yourself."

00:09:16.030 --> 00:09:19.220 align:middle line:84%
So what those two
texts are saying

00:09:19.220 --> 00:09:22.195 align:middle line:84%
is really offering us the key
of this great transformation

00:09:22.195 --> 00:09:23.840 align:middle line:90%
that we are called upon.

00:09:23.840 --> 00:09:27.700 align:middle line:84%
How do we get in
touch with passion

00:09:27.700 --> 00:09:30.790 align:middle line:84%
so that we can
incarnate this passion

00:09:30.790 --> 00:09:33.740 align:middle line:90%
in humble, sacred action?

00:09:33.740 --> 00:09:36.680 align:middle line:84%
Without the passion, we
won't have the energy.

00:09:36.680 --> 00:09:39.410 align:middle line:84%
Without the wisdom,
we won't have

00:09:39.410 --> 00:09:41.280 align:middle line:84%
the clarity and
the skillful means.

00:09:41.280 --> 00:09:43.870 align:middle line:84%
The passion and the
wisdom, the great peace

00:09:43.870 --> 00:09:46.760 align:middle line:84%
and the great wildness have
to come together and have

00:09:46.760 --> 00:09:51.900 align:middle line:84%
to be focused on very
urgent action in every realm

00:09:51.900 --> 00:09:54.670 align:middle line:84%
and on every plane for us to
have a heaven of a chance.

00:09:54.670 --> 00:09:56.280 align:middle line:90%
But we do have that chance.

00:09:56.280 --> 00:09:58.380 align:middle line:90%
But the time is now running out.

00:09:58.380 --> 00:10:00.184 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Absolutely,
it is running out.

00:10:00.184 --> 00:10:00.850 align:middle line:90%
>>HARVEY: It is.

00:10:00.850 --> 00:10:03.567 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And at the same
time, the time is now.

00:10:03.567 --> 00:10:04.150 align:middle line:90%
>>HARVEY: Yes.

00:10:04.150 --> 00:10:05.316 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: I mean, it's both.

00:10:05.316 --> 00:10:07.130 align:middle line:84%
We're at that
confluence right now.

00:10:07.130 --> 00:10:07.630 align:middle line:90%
And--

00:10:07.630 --> 00:10:08.600 align:middle line:84%
>>HARVEY: Well,
in a way, it seems

00:10:08.600 --> 00:10:09.930 align:middle line:90%
as if the time has stopped.

00:10:09.930 --> 00:10:10.820 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:10:10.820 --> 00:10:15.110 align:middle line:84%
>>HARVEY: Because if you look
at it from a position of facts,

00:10:15.110 --> 00:10:16.616 align:middle line:84%
there are many
environmentalists--

00:10:16.616 --> 00:10:18.116 align:middle line:84%
and these are very
wise people-- who

00:10:18.116 --> 00:10:20.530 align:middle line:84%
say we have already
passed the line.

00:10:20.530 --> 00:10:21.940 align:middle line:84%
And there are many
economists who

00:10:21.940 --> 00:10:24.885 align:middle line:84%
say that the economic
system is bound to collapse

00:10:24.885 --> 00:10:27.270 align:middle line:90%
and will create untold misery.

00:10:27.270 --> 00:10:29.460 align:middle line:84%
And there are many
activists who are

00:10:29.460 --> 00:10:32.160 align:middle line:84%
so bound up by all the horror
and the tragedy that they've

00:10:32.160 --> 00:10:34.710 align:middle line:84%
seen and by the coma of
indifference and apathy

00:10:34.710 --> 00:10:38.050 align:middle line:84%
that they've met that they say
the human race is unredeemable.

00:10:38.050 --> 00:10:40.000 align:middle line:90%
And they do have a point.

00:10:40.000 --> 00:10:42.030 align:middle line:90%
They're not mad people.

00:10:42.030 --> 00:10:44.020 align:middle line:84%
They're people who
have suffered hugely

00:10:44.020 --> 00:10:48.190 align:middle line:84%
and who see, without illusion,
the very extreme situation

00:10:48.190 --> 00:10:49.570 align:middle line:90%
that we are in.

00:10:49.570 --> 00:10:52.130 align:middle line:90%
But they're ignoring two things.

00:10:52.130 --> 00:10:55.490 align:middle line:84%
First, that the
very horror itself

00:10:55.490 --> 00:10:59.220 align:middle line:84%
can be the midwife of an
extraordinary transformation.

00:10:59.220 --> 00:11:03.830 align:middle line:84%
And secondly, that God is in
both, the horror and the light.

00:11:03.830 --> 00:11:07.590 align:middle line:84%
And that there is a divine
plan, an evolutionary plan,

00:11:07.590 --> 00:11:10.710 align:middle line:84%
and it entails this
great burning down.

00:11:10.710 --> 00:11:15.290 align:middle line:84%
Because you cannot create a
new world without burning down

00:11:15.290 --> 00:11:17.480 align:middle line:84%
the structures of
oppression of the old one.

00:11:17.480 --> 00:11:19.780 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Absolutely,
and oftentimes

00:11:19.780 --> 00:11:22.130 align:middle line:84%
in various spiritual
circles, they'll

00:11:22.130 --> 00:11:26.760 align:middle line:84%
talk about the inevitability
of the birth of a new humanity.

00:11:26.760 --> 00:11:27.897 align:middle line:90%
But you say, no--

00:11:27.897 --> 00:11:28.980 align:middle line:90%
>>HARVEY: You can't have--

00:11:28.980 --> 00:11:29.790 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: --this
is not inevitable.

00:11:29.790 --> 00:11:30.090 align:middle line:90%
>>HARVEY: No!

00:11:30.090 --> 00:11:31.850 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: --Without our
participation and advanced

00:11:31.850 --> 00:11:32.170 align:middle line:90%
consciousness--

00:11:32.170 --> 00:11:33.253 align:middle line:90%
>>HARVEY: This is rubbish!

00:11:33.253 --> 00:11:34.830 align:middle line:90%
Look, let's get down to it.

00:11:34.830 --> 00:11:37.010 align:middle line:84%
If you want me tell
you what I really--

00:11:37.010 --> 00:11:38.927 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Yes, please
don't hold back, Andrew.

00:11:38.927 --> 00:11:40.051 align:middle line:90%
>>HARVEY: I'm not going to.

00:11:40.051 --> 00:11:41.600 align:middle line:84%
Because there's no
time to hold back.

00:11:41.600 --> 00:11:46.010 align:middle line:84%
The fact is the New Age did
a great service in many ways.

00:11:46.010 --> 00:11:50.110 align:middle line:84%
It brought in deep
understanding of the divine.

00:11:50.110 --> 00:11:52.280 align:middle line:84%
It brought in a
marvelous understanding

00:11:52.280 --> 00:11:54.960 align:middle line:84%
of the relationship between
mysticism and science.

00:11:54.960 --> 00:11:59.099 align:middle line:84%
It brought in a whole new set
of marvelous sacred technologies

00:11:59.099 --> 00:11:59.640 align:middle line:90%
for the body.

00:11:59.640 --> 00:12:01.250 align:middle line:90%
These were great achievements.

00:12:01.250 --> 00:12:05.460 align:middle line:84%
But the New Age got hijacked
by the corporate agenda

00:12:05.460 --> 00:12:08.130 align:middle line:84%
and was transformed by
that corporate agenda

00:12:08.130 --> 00:12:12.980 align:middle line:84%
into being a massive,
narcissistic orgy in which

00:12:12.980 --> 00:12:16.320 align:middle line:84%
people were told that you
connected with the divine,

00:12:16.320 --> 00:12:21.010 align:middle line:84%
basically, to get rich and
fabulous and thin, and manifest

00:12:21.010 --> 00:12:23.260 align:middle line:90%
McMansions and Mercedes.

00:12:23.260 --> 00:12:26.900 align:middle line:84%
This is not just stupid
and vulgar, it's demonic.

00:12:26.900 --> 00:12:30.480 align:middle line:84%
It is insane at a
period like ours,

00:12:30.480 --> 00:12:33.670 align:middle line:84%
when the world is falling
apart, to have in place,

00:12:33.670 --> 00:12:36.480 align:middle line:84%
sponsored by the corporations
and the major publishers,

00:12:36.480 --> 00:12:41.984 align:middle line:84%
a vision of mysticism which is
all about you, you, you, you.

00:12:41.984 --> 00:12:44.370 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Well, 100% material!

00:12:44.370 --> 00:12:47.620 align:middle line:84%
>>HARVEY: Totally materialistic,
and totally narcissistic,

00:12:47.620 --> 00:12:52.010 align:middle line:84%
and absolutely part of
the corporate agenda.

00:12:52.010 --> 00:12:54.600 align:middle line:84%
Because what does the
corporate agenda want

00:12:54.600 --> 00:12:58.170 align:middle line:84%
but a whole group of
people who believed

00:12:58.170 --> 00:13:00.130 align:middle line:84%
that, by spending
more on yoga clothes

00:13:00.130 --> 00:13:02.306 align:middle line:84%
and going to very
expensive intensives,

00:13:02.306 --> 00:13:03.680 align:middle line:84%
they could become
rich, fabulous,

00:13:03.680 --> 00:13:05.170 align:middle line:90%
and thin, and powerful.

00:13:05.170 --> 00:13:09.200 align:middle line:84%
And that just increases the
dissociation, the addiction

00:13:09.200 --> 00:13:12.900 align:middle line:84%
to individualism, the
separation that is actually

00:13:12.900 --> 00:13:14.450 align:middle line:90%
at the root of everything.

00:13:14.450 --> 00:13:19.040 align:middle line:84%
So what's now needed is to say
we accept the good things from

00:13:19.040 --> 00:13:21.570 align:middle line:84%
this, and we are very grateful
that they were accomplished,

00:13:21.570 --> 00:13:25.380 align:middle line:84%
but we cannot anymore afford
this disgusting, obscene,

00:13:25.380 --> 00:13:30.642 align:middle line:84%
blasphemous, idiotic, totally
unauthentic mysticism.

00:13:30.642 --> 00:13:32.000 align:middle line:90%
It is not real.

00:13:32.000 --> 00:13:32.990 align:middle line:90%
And it's not true.

00:13:32.990 --> 00:13:36.260 align:middle line:84%
The great mystics of all the
civilizations-- especially

00:13:36.260 --> 00:13:39.870 align:middle line:84%
Jesus, and the Prophet,
and the Buddha-- say,

00:13:39.870 --> 00:13:42.300 align:middle line:84%
when you are realized,
it's not that you

00:13:42.300 --> 00:13:46.100 align:middle line:84%
use that power to make yourself
rich and famous and gorgeous.

00:13:46.100 --> 00:13:49.460 align:middle line:84%
You use that power
to serve humanity.

00:13:49.460 --> 00:13:53.920 align:middle line:84%
And at this time, in this era,
humanity is burning to death.

00:13:53.920 --> 00:13:56.430 align:middle line:84%
So without turning
that realization

00:13:56.430 --> 00:14:00.994 align:middle line:84%
into sacred action, what
the heaven are you doing?

00:14:00.994 --> 00:14:02.910 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And if not
burning to death, really,

00:14:02.910 --> 00:14:05.660 align:middle line:84%
just turning to
stone, even more so.

00:14:05.660 --> 00:14:07.410 align:middle line:84%
>>HARVEY: Yes, that's
a colder death.

00:14:07.410 --> 00:14:08.993 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: It's a
colder kind of death.

00:14:08.993 --> 00:14:13.820 align:middle line:84%
Because it is one of becoming
numb, numb to reality,

00:14:13.820 --> 00:14:14.590 align:middle line:90%
numb to the need.

00:14:14.590 --> 00:14:15.790 align:middle line:84%
>>HARVEY: Well, did you see
what that thing-- that boy

00:14:15.790 --> 00:14:18.530 align:middle line:84%
said-- this terrible thing
that the boy said who'd

00:14:18.530 --> 00:14:20.947 align:middle line:84%
killed the teenagers
yesterday or a couple of days

00:14:20.947 --> 00:14:22.030 align:middle line:90%
ago when he was arraigned?

00:14:22.030 --> 00:14:22.988 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: No, I didn't.

00:14:22.988 --> 00:14:25.410 align:middle line:84%
>>HARVEY: First of all, he
came into the courtroom,

00:14:25.410 --> 00:14:28.220 align:middle line:84%
and he had "Killer"
on his tee-shirt.

00:14:28.220 --> 00:14:30.210 align:middle line:84%
And he turned and flashed
that at the families

00:14:30.210 --> 00:14:31.920 align:middle line:90%
who'd lost their children.

00:14:31.920 --> 00:14:34.570 align:middle line:84%
And then he said,
"I want you to know

00:14:34.570 --> 00:14:38.740 align:middle line:84%
that the hand that
killed your children

00:14:38.740 --> 00:14:40.960 align:middle line:84%
is also jerking off
to their memory."

00:14:40.960 --> 00:14:41.880 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Oh, jeez.

00:14:41.880 --> 00:14:44.170 align:middle line:90%
>>HARVEY: Can you imagine?

00:14:44.170 --> 00:14:47.140 align:middle line:84%
Look at the case of
the school kids--

00:14:47.140 --> 00:14:51.709 align:middle line:84%
high school kids who raped a
girl and who televised that--

00:14:51.709 --> 00:14:52.500 align:middle line:90%
videoed that rape--

00:14:52.500 --> 00:14:53.791 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: I know, it was just--

00:14:53.791 --> 00:14:56.480 align:middle line:84%
>>HARVEY: --and who
just let it happen.

00:14:56.480 --> 00:15:01.140 align:middle line:84%
The soul of the world
is turning to ice.

00:15:01.140 --> 00:15:04.550 align:middle line:84%
And I believe that the
divine is the great fire that

00:15:04.550 --> 00:15:07.330 align:middle line:84%
is trying to melt this ice
and that sacred activism

00:15:07.330 --> 00:15:12.080 align:middle line:84%
is the power that-- if only
we can get truly, truly

00:15:12.080 --> 00:15:15.910 align:middle line:84%
attuned to it-- will help us
overcome this terrible apathy,

00:15:15.910 --> 00:15:18.190 align:middle line:84%
this terrible coca
coma we're in,

00:15:18.190 --> 00:15:22.690 align:middle line:84%
this appalling addiction
to irony and cynicism

00:15:22.690 --> 00:15:26.150 align:middle line:84%
and paralysis that has
now flamed the human soul.

00:15:26.150 --> 00:15:27.970 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: But addicted
is the correct word.

00:15:27.970 --> 00:15:31.710 align:middle line:84%
If you're looking at it from a
purely chemical point of view,

00:15:31.710 --> 00:15:36.170 align:middle line:84%
the brain is addicted to these
levels of fear and destruction

00:15:36.170 --> 00:15:36.670 align:middle line:90%
now.

00:15:36.670 --> 00:15:40.750 align:middle line:84%
I mean, that's why the saying,
when it bleeds, it leads.

00:15:40.750 --> 00:15:42.860 align:middle line:90%
And that is true.

00:15:42.860 --> 00:15:45.560 align:middle line:84%
And so we have a
chemical addiction

00:15:45.560 --> 00:15:48.320 align:middle line:84%
for whatever needs
to be exploited

00:15:48.320 --> 00:15:49.920 align:middle line:90%
by the media in that moment.

00:15:49.920 --> 00:15:52.170 align:middle line:84%
And we have to find
our way out of that.

00:15:52.170 --> 00:15:54.290 align:middle line:90%
We're narcotized, hypnotized.

00:15:54.290 --> 00:15:57.240 align:middle line:84%
We have to find our way out,
to break that because it

00:15:57.240 --> 00:15:59.360 align:middle line:90%
is creating, truly, a paralysis.

00:15:59.360 --> 00:16:01.500 align:middle line:84%
And I swear, we would
rather do anything

00:16:01.500 --> 00:16:04.260 align:middle line:84%
than have to listen to one
more headline, most of us.

00:16:04.260 --> 00:16:07.380 align:middle line:84%
Even though we're addicted,
we can barely stand it anymore

00:16:07.380 --> 00:16:08.070 align:middle line:90%
as a species.

00:16:08.070 --> 00:16:09.770 align:middle line:84%
We're breaking under the
weight of the negativity.

00:16:09.770 --> 00:16:10.366 align:middle line:84%
>>HARVEY: Well, I
think that there

00:16:10.366 --> 00:16:12.500 align:middle line:84%
only three possible
solutions, really,

00:16:12.500 --> 00:16:13.730 align:middle line:90%
and we have to do them all.

00:16:13.730 --> 00:16:16.850 align:middle line:84%
I think, first of all, we
need to simplify our life

00:16:16.850 --> 00:16:23.250 align:middle line:84%
and carve out time for silence,
time to commune, just simply,

00:16:23.250 --> 00:16:24.950 align:middle line:90%
with reality.

00:16:24.950 --> 00:16:28.230 align:middle line:84%
The second thing we need to do,
all of us, all human beings,

00:16:28.230 --> 00:16:31.440 align:middle line:84%
is to have a very simple
spiritual practice

00:16:31.440 --> 00:16:33.700 align:middle line:90%
that we do regularly.

00:16:33.700 --> 00:16:35.840 align:middle line:84%
Because only such
a simple practice

00:16:35.840 --> 00:16:38.250 align:middle line:84%
can create a container
strong enough for us

00:16:38.250 --> 00:16:41.370 align:middle line:90%
to be able to face where we are.

00:16:41.370 --> 00:16:43.710 align:middle line:84%
And the third thing
that we all need to do--

00:16:43.710 --> 00:16:46.140 align:middle line:84%
and this is the message
of sacred activism--

00:16:46.140 --> 00:16:49.600 align:middle line:84%
is that we all need to
start-- within the terms

00:16:49.600 --> 00:16:53.920 align:middle line:84%
of our own lives,
temperaments, and resources--

00:16:53.920 --> 00:16:58.080 align:middle line:84%
start doing something
real about the real agony,

00:16:58.080 --> 00:17:00.290 align:middle line:84%
and the real heartbreak,
and the real misery,

00:17:00.290 --> 00:17:03.540 align:middle line:84%
and the real suffering
that is in the real world,

00:17:03.540 --> 00:17:07.300 align:middle line:84%
doing something in the name
of justice and compassion.

00:17:07.300 --> 00:17:09.440 align:middle line:84%
It doesn't have to
be Mother Theresa.

00:17:09.440 --> 00:17:11.660 align:middle line:84%
You don't have to wake up
tomorrow and go and live

00:17:11.660 --> 00:17:13.920 align:middle line:84%
in Calcutta and give
everything away.

00:17:13.920 --> 00:17:15.390 align:middle line:84%
You don't have to
be Desmond Tutu.

00:17:15.390 --> 00:17:20.089 align:middle line:84%
You have to be you as a caring,
loving, human being, aware

00:17:20.089 --> 00:17:22.359 align:middle line:84%
that you're part of a human
race that is potentially

00:17:22.359 --> 00:17:24.859 align:middle line:84%
going extinct through
its own madness.

00:17:24.859 --> 00:17:28.660 align:middle line:84%
And you have to peacefully but
passionately turn up and choose

00:17:28.660 --> 00:17:33.800 align:middle line:84%
something, anything, and
focus your energies on that,

00:17:33.800 --> 00:17:35.880 align:middle line:90%
and really help.

00:17:35.880 --> 00:17:37.560 align:middle line:84%
Because if you do,
you will discover

00:17:37.560 --> 00:17:39.810 align:middle line:84%
that your life will be
flooded with meaning and joy

00:17:39.810 --> 00:17:40.862 align:middle line:90%
and passion.

00:17:40.862 --> 00:17:43.320 align:middle line:84%
And that's what everybody needs
to experience at this time.

00:17:43.320 --> 00:17:45.361 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And yet, every
single message out there

00:17:45.361 --> 00:17:47.320 align:middle line:84%
is telling us everything
but to simplify.

00:17:47.320 --> 00:17:49.590 align:middle line:90%
Make it more complex.

00:17:49.590 --> 00:17:50.920 align:middle line:90%
We have greater needs.

00:17:50.920 --> 00:17:52.210 align:middle line:90%
You're not enough for this.

00:17:52.210 --> 00:17:53.499 align:middle line:90%
You don't have enough of that.

00:17:53.499 --> 00:17:54.790 align:middle line:90%
You're not good enough at that.

00:17:54.790 --> 00:17:55.456 align:middle line:90%
>>HARVEY: Right.

00:17:55.456 --> 00:17:58.280 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And so, every
message is reinforcing the need

00:17:58.280 --> 00:18:01.340 align:middle line:84%
to go further into the external
world and complicate it.

00:18:01.340 --> 00:18:04.270 align:middle line:84%
>>HARVEY: Well, and if you have,
on top of that, the churches

00:18:04.270 --> 00:18:07.170 align:middle line:84%
regressing into fundamentalism--
Islam and Judaism

00:18:07.170 --> 00:18:10.680 align:middle line:84%
and Christianity-- and
the New Age celebrating

00:18:10.680 --> 00:18:13.910 align:middle line:84%
"The Secret," which is the
Whore of Babylon masturbating

00:18:13.910 --> 00:18:18.610 align:middle line:84%
in public, I would say-- to
put it mildly-- telling people

00:18:18.610 --> 00:18:22.680 align:middle line:84%
that God is there as a
kind of servant in hotpants

00:18:22.680 --> 00:18:25.560 align:middle line:84%
to fulfill every fantasy
of your ego, then

00:18:25.560 --> 00:18:28.630 align:middle line:84%
how will people get
to the authentic truth

00:18:28.630 --> 00:18:31.180 align:middle line:84%
of the authentic
relationship with the divine?

00:18:31.180 --> 00:18:33.350 align:middle line:84%
And how will they get
to the empowerment

00:18:33.350 --> 00:18:34.380 align:middle line:90%
that comes through that?

00:18:34.380 --> 00:18:36.630 align:middle line:84%
That's what my life and the
life of the other teachers

00:18:36.630 --> 00:18:38.560 align:middle line:84%
like myself has been
devoted to, to get

00:18:38.560 --> 00:18:40.410 align:middle line:84%
the real message of
the real mysticism

00:18:40.410 --> 00:18:43.100 align:middle line:84%
and the real practices
across to people.

00:18:43.100 --> 00:18:46.134 align:middle line:84%
Because, if they don't get
to it, the world will end.

00:18:46.134 --> 00:18:47.550 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And
ironically, you were

00:18:47.550 --> 00:18:50.700 align:middle line:84%
talking about the
extinction of our species.

00:18:50.700 --> 00:18:53.040 align:middle line:84%
And yet, at the same time,
if you look at it from--

00:18:53.040 --> 00:18:53.705 align:middle line:90%
>>HARVEY: Not just our species!

00:18:53.705 --> 00:18:54.420 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Of all species--

00:18:54.420 --> 00:18:55.120 align:middle line:84%
>>HARVEY: --the
lions, the leopards--

00:18:55.120 --> 00:18:56.340 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes, I understand.

00:18:56.340 --> 00:18:59.141 align:middle line:84%
>>HARVEY: --my god, sometimes I
feel if it was just us that was

00:18:59.141 --> 00:18:59.640 align:middle line:90%
going--

00:18:59.640 --> 00:19:00.110 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: That would
be OK. [LAUGHS]

00:19:00.110 --> 00:19:01.140 align:middle line:84%
>>HARVEY: --that might be
a good thing for nature.

00:19:01.140 --> 00:19:04.009 align:middle line:84%
But we are taking, like
Hitler was taking-- wanted

00:19:04.009 --> 00:19:06.050 align:middle line:84%
to take the whole of
Germany with him at the end.

00:19:06.050 --> 00:19:08.290 align:middle line:84%
It seems that we're on
an orgy of destruction,

00:19:08.290 --> 00:19:09.990 align:middle line:90%
which is bent on taking.

00:19:09.990 --> 00:19:12.360 align:middle line:84%
Why should my cat
suffer for what we are?

00:19:12.360 --> 00:19:14.900 align:middle line:84%
Why should the white
lions have to endure

00:19:14.900 --> 00:19:16.170 align:middle line:90%
the horror of canned hunting?

00:19:16.170 --> 00:19:19.080 align:middle line:84%
Why should the elephants be
being slaughtered for ivory?

00:19:19.080 --> 00:19:21.390 align:middle line:84%
Why should these gorgeous
beasts, the rhinos,

00:19:21.390 --> 00:19:25.050 align:middle line:84%
be being killed so that
politicians in Thailand

00:19:25.050 --> 00:19:25.880 align:middle line:90%
can have erections?

00:19:25.880 --> 00:19:27.530 align:middle line:90%
This is unspeakable.

00:19:27.530 --> 00:19:28.600 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: It is.

00:19:28.600 --> 00:19:29.480 align:middle line:90%
It's barbaric.

00:19:29.480 --> 00:19:29.700 align:middle line:90%
>>HARVEY: It is.

00:19:29.700 --> 00:19:32.035 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: I mean, these are
the Dark Ages in that respect.

00:19:32.035 --> 00:19:32.951 align:middle line:90%
But what I was going--

00:19:32.951 --> 00:19:35.270 align:middle line:84%
>>HARVEY: There have
never been such dark ages.

00:19:35.270 --> 00:19:37.530 align:middle line:90%
This is the ultimate Dark Age.

00:19:37.530 --> 00:19:43.210 align:middle line:84%
Because there's a whole
coating of business-as-usual,

00:19:43.210 --> 00:19:46.277 align:middle line:84%
Versailles-on-crack--
you know what I'm saying?

00:19:46.277 --> 00:19:46.860 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:19:46.860 --> 00:19:49.600 align:middle line:84%
>>HARVEY: The CEOs
make Marie Antoinette

00:19:49.600 --> 00:19:51.220 align:middle line:90%
look like Mother Teresa.

00:19:51.220 --> 00:19:52.830 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And yet,
at the same time,

00:19:52.830 --> 00:19:55.600 align:middle line:84%
I'm looking at a
flat out agenda,

00:19:55.600 --> 00:19:57.110 align:middle line:90%
you could say an elite agenda--

00:19:57.110 --> 00:19:58.235 align:middle line:90%
>>HARVEY: Oh, very much so.

00:19:58.235 --> 00:20:01.010 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: --which is to see
to it that-- now, I'm only

00:20:01.010 --> 00:20:03.310 align:middle line:84%
speaking of the human
population at this point--

00:20:03.310 --> 00:20:06.110 align:middle line:84%
is reduced to, roughly, a
half a billion people, looking

00:20:06.110 --> 00:20:07.650 align:middle line:84%
at the Georgia
guide-stones and some

00:20:07.650 --> 00:20:10.550 align:middle line:84%
of the other well-known
agendas, which is interesting.

00:20:10.550 --> 00:20:12.510 align:middle line:90%
You say, we don't need any help.

00:20:12.510 --> 00:20:14.730 align:middle line:84%
Because we're on the path
to doing that to ourselves.

00:20:14.730 --> 00:20:15.570 align:middle line:90%
>>HARVEY: Yes.

00:20:15.570 --> 00:20:17.680 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: But not
without a great deal

00:20:17.680 --> 00:20:21.520 align:middle line:84%
of help in the psychological,
emotional, mental realms

00:20:21.520 --> 00:20:23.860 align:middle line:84%
from the puppet
masters that project

00:20:23.860 --> 00:20:27.010 align:middle line:84%
all of these images to us that
are, quote, "for our own good."

00:20:27.010 --> 00:20:28.607 align:middle line:84%
>>HARVEY: You know,
at one time, when

00:20:28.607 --> 00:20:30.190 align:middle line:84%
I heard something
like that, I thought

00:20:30.190 --> 00:20:31.509 align:middle line:90%
this was conspiracy theory.

00:20:31.509 --> 00:20:32.050 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: No.

00:20:32.050 --> 00:20:33.110 align:middle line:90%
>>HARVEY: But it isn't.

00:20:33.110 --> 00:20:37.110 align:middle line:84%
When you look at the way in
which the media is set up

00:20:37.110 --> 00:20:40.490 align:middle line:84%
to pour avalanches of
trash and insecurity

00:20:40.490 --> 00:20:43.050 align:middle line:84%
into people's minds--
and violence--

00:20:43.050 --> 00:20:47.260 align:middle line:84%
and get fat-cat rich out of
it, when you look at the way

00:20:47.260 --> 00:20:50.420 align:middle line:84%
in which those religious
positions are celebrated

00:20:50.420 --> 00:20:54.100 align:middle line:84%
by the corporations that keep
alive their vision of keeping

00:20:54.100 --> 00:20:59.730 align:middle line:84%
people greedy and atomized, when
you look at the way in which

00:20:59.730 --> 00:21:03.870 align:middle line:84%
corporations run by a few
individuals dominate the media,

00:21:03.870 --> 00:21:08.020 align:middle line:84%
politicians, and the whole
world in which we live and have

00:21:08.020 --> 00:21:11.890 align:middle line:84%
almost total freedom to do
whatever they like including,

00:21:11.890 --> 00:21:14.890 align:middle line:84%
in America-- through the
Supreme Court, no less--

00:21:14.890 --> 00:21:16.449 align:middle line:84%
to buy any politician
they want--

00:21:16.449 --> 00:21:17.990 align:middle line:84%
because they are
individuals and they

00:21:17.990 --> 00:21:18.860 align:middle line:90%
can pay whatever they want--

00:21:18.860 --> 00:21:19.780 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: I know, it's sick.

00:21:19.780 --> 00:21:20.240 align:middle line:90%
>>HARVEY: --it's insane.

00:21:20.240 --> 00:21:21.880 align:middle line:90%
Of course, there is an agenda.

00:21:21.880 --> 00:21:26.170 align:middle line:84%
And of course, if you were
a rich, unscrupulous, crazy

00:21:26.170 --> 00:21:29.820 align:middle line:84%
person who really wanted to
keep your power, what you would

00:21:29.820 --> 00:21:34.230 align:middle line:84%
be planning is,
let billions die.

00:21:34.230 --> 00:21:36.730 align:middle line:84%
The rest will be
cowed and frightened.

00:21:36.730 --> 00:21:38.230 align:middle line:90%
We will bring in our leader.

00:21:38.230 --> 00:21:40.300 align:middle line:90%
We will dominate everything.

00:21:40.300 --> 00:21:41.850 align:middle line:90%
And we will keep our power.

00:21:41.850 --> 00:21:42.587 align:middle line:90%
That's what's on.

00:21:42.587 --> 00:21:43.670 align:middle line:90%
That's what they're doing.

00:21:43.670 --> 00:21:44.930 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Well, that game is on.

00:21:44.930 --> 00:21:46.000 align:middle line:90%
We're in the midst of it.

00:21:46.000 --> 00:21:48.280 align:middle line:84%
And everything you
speak to is, really,

00:21:48.280 --> 00:21:51.350 align:middle line:84%
to counter that particular
game through the re-awakening

00:21:51.350 --> 00:21:52.260 align:middle line:90%
of ourselves.

00:21:52.260 --> 00:21:55.300 align:middle line:84%
I mean, the greatest sin--
if you can call anything

00:21:55.300 --> 00:21:59.550 align:middle line:84%
a sin, per se-- is that the
human species has been cut off,

00:21:59.550 --> 00:22:03.147 align:middle line:84%
intentionally, from knowledge of
itself, its own divine nature.

00:22:03.147 --> 00:22:03.980 align:middle line:90%
>>HARVEY: That's it.

00:22:03.980 --> 00:22:07.970 align:middle line:84%
But first, there are two kinds
of knowledge that you need.

00:22:07.970 --> 00:22:10.256 align:middle line:84%
First, you need the
knowledge that you

00:22:10.256 --> 00:22:14.300 align:middle line:84%
are one with divine
consciousness in your core.

00:22:14.300 --> 00:22:17.230 align:middle line:84%
Then, you need
the knowledge that

00:22:17.230 --> 00:22:19.580 align:middle line:84%
at the core of that
divine consciousness

00:22:19.580 --> 00:22:22.950 align:middle line:84%
is a burning love for reality
that translates itself

00:22:22.950 --> 00:22:25.144 align:middle line:84%
as love in action on
behalf of justice.

00:22:25.144 --> 00:22:25.935 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Fearless.

00:22:25.935 --> 00:22:30.360 align:middle line:84%
>>HARVEY: Fearless, passionate,
compassionate love in action.

00:22:30.360 --> 00:22:33.510 align:middle line:84%
If you only have the
first-- as a lot of people

00:22:33.510 --> 00:22:36.560 align:middle line:84%
are getting to-- you don't
have the active component.

00:22:36.560 --> 00:22:39.500 align:middle line:84%
If you have both what you could
call the passive component

00:22:39.500 --> 00:22:42.630 align:middle line:84%
of understanding your divine
consciousness as great peace,

00:22:42.630 --> 00:22:45.640 align:middle line:84%
immortality,
transcendent awareness,

00:22:45.640 --> 00:22:47.500 align:middle line:84%
you only have one
side of the picture.

00:22:47.500 --> 00:22:49.300 align:middle line:84%
The other side is
the mother side.

00:22:49.300 --> 00:22:53.350 align:middle line:84%
You've got to also know that
that divine consciousness is

00:22:53.350 --> 00:22:55.920 align:middle line:84%
passionately concerned
with the animals,

00:22:55.920 --> 00:22:58.560 align:middle line:84%
with the state of the fields,
with the state of the seas--

00:22:58.560 --> 00:22:59.330 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: With the water, yes.

00:22:59.330 --> 00:23:01.079 align:middle line:84%
>>HARVEY: --with the
poor, with the water.

00:23:01.079 --> 00:23:03.660 align:middle line:84%
Because it is living
in those things.

00:23:03.660 --> 00:23:07.330 align:middle line:84%
It is living in
and as everything.

00:23:07.330 --> 00:23:09.510 align:middle line:84%
And both forms of
knowledge are very

00:23:09.510 --> 00:23:11.490 align:middle line:84%
dangerous to the
patriarchy, that close.

00:23:11.490 --> 00:23:15.380 align:middle line:84%
And that's why they have so
brilliantly sponsored the New

00:23:15.380 --> 00:23:17.397 align:middle line:84%
Age agenda, which really
renders people passive.

00:23:17.397 --> 00:23:19.605 align:middle line:84%
Because they don't really
get to divine consciousness

00:23:19.605 --> 00:23:20.820 align:middle line:90%
in the New Age.

00:23:20.820 --> 00:23:22.790 align:middle line:84%
And they certainly
don't get to action.

00:23:22.790 --> 00:23:25.490 align:middle line:84%
They get to a kind of
glorified narcissism

00:23:25.490 --> 00:23:27.100 align:middle line:84%
in which they do
absolutely nothing

00:23:27.100 --> 00:23:28.141 align:middle line:90%
and claim to be realized.

00:23:28.141 --> 00:23:31.254 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Yes, and sometimes
even a numbness of sorts.

00:23:31.254 --> 00:23:32.420 align:middle line:90%
>>HARVEY: Numbness of sorts?

00:23:32.420 --> 00:23:33.750 align:middle line:90%
It's worse than that.

00:23:33.750 --> 00:23:35.260 align:middle line:90%
They are actually psychotic.

00:23:35.260 --> 00:23:40.560 align:middle line:84%
Because, I think, when people
say, only the light is real,

00:23:40.560 --> 00:23:42.630 align:middle line:90%
the devil laughs, if you like.

00:23:42.630 --> 00:23:44.600 align:middle line:90%
The demonic laughs.

00:23:44.600 --> 00:23:49.103 align:middle line:84%
Here, we have the darkness in
us having a worldwide terminal

00:23:49.103 --> 00:23:50.130 align:middle line:90%
orgy.

00:23:50.130 --> 00:23:53.020 align:middle line:84%
And you have spiritual
leaders, so-called,

00:23:53.020 --> 00:23:56.230 align:middle line:84%
in soft voices saying,
only the light is real.

00:23:56.230 --> 00:23:58.140 align:middle line:90%
Don't look at the dark.

00:23:58.140 --> 00:23:59.580 align:middle line:90%
Don't.

00:23:59.580 --> 00:24:01.580 align:middle line:90%
Everything's in divine order.

00:24:01.580 --> 00:24:04.780 align:middle line:84%
What an insult to God to assume
that what we've created out

00:24:04.780 --> 00:24:06.864 align:middle line:84%
of the world through our
greed is in divine order.

00:24:06.864 --> 00:24:08.405 align:middle line:84%
Why would God have
sent the prophets?

00:24:08.405 --> 00:24:10.350 align:middle line:84%
Why would God have sent
the Buddha and Jesus

00:24:10.350 --> 00:24:11.240 align:middle line:90%
and the Prophet?

00:24:11.240 --> 00:24:12.270 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Many lifeboats
have been sent.

00:24:12.270 --> 00:24:14.020 align:middle line:84%
>>HARVEY: Many lifeboats,
many messengers.

00:24:14.020 --> 00:24:16.380 align:middle line:84%
If you think this is
what the divine wants,

00:24:16.380 --> 00:24:19.850 align:middle line:84%
that we are killing everything
and living a completely

00:24:19.850 --> 00:24:22.600 align:middle line:84%
obscene life while
the poor starve,

00:24:22.600 --> 00:24:27.240 align:middle line:84%
then you have a very,
very crazy vision of God.

00:24:27.240 --> 00:24:30.060 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And yet,
these cycles do happen.

00:24:30.060 --> 00:24:32.340 align:middle line:84%
If you go with the Yuga
Cycles, for example,

00:24:32.340 --> 00:24:36.090 align:middle line:84%
there are cycles dominated by
dark and dominated by light.

00:24:36.090 --> 00:24:39.200 align:middle line:84%
And on the large
scale, we're coming out

00:24:39.200 --> 00:24:42.290 align:middle line:84%
of a very, very
dark period, trying

00:24:42.290 --> 00:24:44.840 align:middle line:84%
to emerge-- attempting
to emerge into the light.

00:24:44.840 --> 00:24:48.490 align:middle line:84%
And let's just go back
as far as the 1960s,

00:24:48.490 --> 00:24:50.110 align:middle line:90%
in our recent history.

00:24:50.110 --> 00:24:54.890 align:middle line:84%
This was, cosmologically, the
beginning of a real opening

00:24:54.890 --> 00:24:57.442 align:middle line:84%
to plant the seed for
what you're saying now.

00:24:57.442 --> 00:24:58.400 align:middle line:90%
>>HARVEY: Well, it was.

00:24:58.400 --> 00:24:59.761 align:middle line:90%
But it was also failure.

00:24:59.761 --> 00:25:01.010 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes, it didn't take.

00:25:01.010 --> 00:25:02.385 align:middle line:84%
>>HARVEY: I think
the '60s failed

00:25:02.385 --> 00:25:04.040 align:middle line:84%
because there wasn't
enough discipline.

00:25:04.040 --> 00:25:06.637 align:middle line:84%
And there wasn't enough
real, radical action.

00:25:06.637 --> 00:25:08.220 align:middle line:84%
All those people
that were decorated--

00:25:08.220 --> 00:25:09.780 align:middle line:90%
and I was in the '60s.

00:25:09.780 --> 00:25:12.935 align:middle line:84%
So most of my friends who were
dancing half-naked with flowers

00:25:12.935 --> 00:25:15.337 align:middle line:84%
in their hair then became
accountants and CEOs--

00:25:15.337 --> 00:25:16.670 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: This is true! [LAUGHS]

00:25:16.670 --> 00:25:17.961 align:middle line:90%
>>HARVEY: --and the rest of it.

00:25:17.961 --> 00:25:21.190 align:middle line:84%
So there wasn't enough real,
radical passion or commitment

00:25:21.190 --> 00:25:24.390 align:middle line:84%
to compassionate, just
action in the very vision

00:25:24.390 --> 00:25:25.590 align:middle line:90%
that imposed it.

00:25:25.590 --> 00:25:27.880 align:middle line:84%
Singing along to Bob Dylan--
glorious though he is--

00:25:27.880 --> 00:25:30.307 align:middle line:84%
is not quite enough for the
transformation to pan out.

00:25:30.307 --> 00:25:32.640 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And you can say
this with all the introduction

00:25:32.640 --> 00:25:36.180 align:middle line:84%
of all of the world's
great spiritual traditions.

00:25:36.180 --> 00:25:40.430 align:middle line:84%
There were enlightened
beings, knowledgeable beings

00:25:40.430 --> 00:25:44.160 align:middle line:84%
that have come along throughout
history-- each one with a very

00:25:44.160 --> 00:25:48.990 align:middle line:84%
similar message-- to help us
begin to, not only take action,

00:25:48.990 --> 00:25:52.720 align:middle line:84%
but also to align with this
higher aspect of our own selves

00:25:52.720 --> 00:25:55.100 align:middle line:84%
that you call the
divine aspect of self.

00:25:55.100 --> 00:25:57.859 align:middle line:84%
And yet, it has not
been accomplished yet.

00:25:57.859 --> 00:25:59.400 align:middle line:84%
>>HARVEY: Well, I'm
not sure they all

00:25:59.400 --> 00:26:00.800 align:middle line:90%
came in with similar messages.

00:26:00.800 --> 00:26:02.590 align:middle line:84%
I think there are very
subtle differences.

00:26:02.590 --> 00:26:04.220 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Well,
you are a scholar.

00:26:04.220 --> 00:26:04.770 align:middle line:90%
I know that.

00:26:04.770 --> 00:26:05.270 align:middle line:90%
>>HARVEY: No, no.

00:26:05.270 --> 00:26:06.853 align:middle line:84%
I think that what
we need to listen to

00:26:06.853 --> 00:26:08.980 align:middle line:84%
are the messages from
the enlightened ones that

00:26:08.980 --> 00:26:10.440 align:middle line:90%
stress action.

00:26:10.440 --> 00:26:12.380 align:middle line:84%
After all, you
can really believe

00:26:12.380 --> 00:26:13.950 align:middle line:90%
what the Buddha is teaching.

00:26:13.950 --> 00:26:16.850 align:middle line:84%
And you can really, then,
devote your life to meditation

00:26:16.850 --> 00:26:17.850 align:middle line:90%
to attain enlightenment.

00:26:17.850 --> 00:26:20.433 align:middle line:84%
But I don't think enlightenment
is enough in a time like this.

00:26:20.433 --> 00:26:23.110 align:middle line:84%
I don't think even that kind
of enlightenment is enough.

00:26:23.110 --> 00:26:25.690 align:middle line:84%
It's got to be an
enlightenment in the service

00:26:25.690 --> 00:26:27.670 align:middle line:90%
of compassionate, just action.

00:26:27.670 --> 00:26:29.630 align:middle line:10%
And that's why Jesus
is so important to me,

00:26:29.630 --> 00:26:31.710 align:middle line:10%
why the Prophet is
so important to me,

00:26:31.710 --> 00:26:36.180 align:middle line:10%
why the great Hindu reformers
are so important to me--

00:26:36.180 --> 00:26:39.420 align:middle line:10%
like Gandhi-- because
they say to us, look.

00:26:39.420 --> 00:26:42.400 align:middle line:84%
It's not enough to
have a divine awareness

00:26:42.400 --> 00:26:44.456 align:middle line:84%
and have a few astounding,
mystical experiences.

00:26:44.456 --> 00:26:45.580 align:middle line:90%
They're just the beginning.

00:26:45.580 --> 00:26:47.140 align:middle line:90%
They're the foundation.

00:26:47.140 --> 00:26:50.330 align:middle line:84%
If you don't realize
that the world is real,

00:26:50.330 --> 00:26:53.170 align:middle line:84%
and that we're in a real
crisis, and it's really

00:26:53.170 --> 00:26:56.810 align:middle line:84%
burning to death, and
we're really endangered,

00:26:56.810 --> 00:26:59.290 align:middle line:84%
you'll go off into your
transcendental addiction

00:26:59.290 --> 00:27:03.652 align:middle line:84%
and not focus on what
needs to be done right now.

00:27:03.652 --> 00:27:04.610 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: That is true.

00:27:04.610 --> 00:27:07.200 align:middle line:84%
And yet, we're dancing
on the edge of this sword

00:27:07.200 --> 00:27:11.450 align:middle line:84%
where we need to be enraged over
those things that are hurting

00:27:11.450 --> 00:27:15.580 align:middle line:84%
and damaging all life
forms on this planet.

00:27:15.580 --> 00:27:19.160 align:middle line:84%
And yet, at the same time,
it's really important

00:27:19.160 --> 00:27:22.730 align:middle line:84%
that we stop casting poison
darts at one another.

00:27:22.730 --> 00:27:24.840 align:middle line:84%
The judgment
portion of it really

00:27:24.840 --> 00:27:25.922 align:middle line:90%
does need to be dropped--

00:27:25.922 --> 00:27:27.130 align:middle line:90%
>>HARVEY: Well, no, I think--

00:27:27.130 --> 00:27:29.540 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: --while still
being enraged appropriately

00:27:29.540 --> 00:27:30.480 align:middle line:90%
to action.

00:27:30.480 --> 00:27:32.220 align:middle line:84%
>>HARVEY: Can I make
some distinctions

00:27:32.220 --> 00:27:33.136 align:middle line:90%
that might be helpful?

00:27:33.136 --> 00:27:34.090 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:27:34.090 --> 00:27:36.810 align:middle line:84%
>>HARVEY: I think
it's very important

00:27:36.810 --> 00:27:42.490 align:middle line:84%
to make an extraordinarily clear
distinction between judgment--

00:27:42.490 --> 00:27:47.430 align:middle line:84%
which is always an ego activity
in which you're projecting

00:27:47.430 --> 00:27:51.660 align:middle line:84%
your own secret CEO,
your own serial killer,

00:27:51.660 --> 00:27:54.350 align:middle line:84%
your own addictive
power and lust and money

00:27:54.350 --> 00:27:56.450 align:middle line:84%
onto someone else,
conveniently, to get away

00:27:56.450 --> 00:27:58.360 align:middle line:84%
from understanding
your own shadow.

00:27:58.360 --> 00:28:00.470 align:middle line:84%
And everybody has
all of those shadows.

00:28:00.470 --> 00:28:04.122 align:middle line:84%
So that kind of judgement is
just a masturbation of the ego.

00:28:04.122 --> 00:28:06.705 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And that's the one I'm
speaking of, not discernment.

00:28:06.705 --> 00:28:09.900 align:middle line:84%
>>HARVEY: Discernment
is absolutely essential.

00:28:09.900 --> 00:28:14.610 align:middle line:84%
Because we have to be able
to face those CEOs who

00:28:14.610 --> 00:28:16.490 align:middle line:84%
are addicted to
destroying the planet,

00:28:16.490 --> 00:28:18.970 align:middle line:84%
those politicians who are
in the pay of those CEOs,

00:28:18.970 --> 00:28:22.690 align:middle line:84%
and those media-barons who
are enacting the appalling

00:28:22.690 --> 00:28:25.040 align:middle line:84%
stupidities that keep
that madness going.

00:28:25.040 --> 00:28:28.670 align:middle line:84%
We have to be able to face
them and say, I love you.

00:28:28.670 --> 00:28:30.210 align:middle line:90%
I know why you're doing this.

00:28:30.210 --> 00:28:32.180 align:middle line:90%
I respect your brilliance.

00:28:32.180 --> 00:28:33.750 align:middle line:90%
But this is wrong--

00:28:33.750 --> 00:28:35.375 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And I'm
turning the dial off.

00:28:35.375 --> 00:28:36.666 align:middle line:90%
>>HARVEY: --and it has to stop.

00:28:36.666 --> 00:28:37.948 align:middle line:90%
And we must stop this.

00:28:37.948 --> 00:28:39.156 align:middle line:90%
And we are going to mobilize.

00:28:39.156 --> 00:28:42.520 align:middle line:84%
We are going to mobilize
in a great, grassroots,

00:28:42.520 --> 00:28:44.550 align:middle line:90%
revolution of love in action.

00:28:44.550 --> 00:28:46.810 align:middle line:84%
We're not going to
condemn you, but we're not

00:28:46.810 --> 00:28:50.330 align:middle line:84%
going to let you get away
with it because the world is

00:28:50.330 --> 00:28:54.170 align:middle line:84%
at stake and because your
own souls are at stake.

00:28:54.170 --> 00:28:55.960 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: It's
withdrawing support

00:28:55.960 --> 00:28:57.860 align:middle line:84%
of the things that are
not working for us.

00:28:57.860 --> 00:28:59.320 align:middle line:84%
>>HARVEY: Yes, but
also protesting.

00:28:59.320 --> 00:29:02.290 align:middle line:84%
You see, Gandhi and
Martin Luther King

00:29:02.290 --> 00:29:03.870 align:middle line:90%
are marvelous examples.

00:29:03.870 --> 00:29:06.954 align:middle line:84%
Gandhi never
condemned the British.

00:29:06.954 --> 00:29:07.620 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:29:07.620 --> 00:29:10.760 align:middle line:84%
>>HARVEY: He condemned
the British actions

00:29:10.760 --> 00:29:14.550 align:middle line:84%
while honoring the spirit
of God in the British.

00:29:14.550 --> 00:29:17.850 align:middle line:84%
I don't condemn
the individual CEO.

00:29:17.850 --> 00:29:21.390 align:middle line:84%
But I may condemn the
action of an oil company

00:29:21.390 --> 00:29:27.150 align:middle line:84%
that rapes Nigeria and soils the
Amazon, et cetera, et cetera.

00:29:27.150 --> 00:29:30.010 align:middle line:84%
I don't condemn the
corrupt politician.

00:29:30.010 --> 00:29:32.680 align:middle line:84%
I understand that I have a
corrupt politician within me,

00:29:32.680 --> 00:29:35.230 align:middle line:84%
which is why I know
him or her so well.

00:29:35.230 --> 00:29:39.390 align:middle line:84%
But I absolutely protest
against the actions that

00:29:39.390 --> 00:29:42.260 align:middle line:84%
lead to degradation and
cruelty that emanate from that.

00:29:42.260 --> 00:29:43.330 align:middle line:90%
This is very important.

00:29:43.330 --> 00:29:45.530 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So until we can
really see this, maybe,

00:29:45.530 --> 00:29:48.650 align:middle line:84%
not-so-divine complicity
that all of us have--

00:29:48.650 --> 00:29:51.020 align:middle line:84%
we all chose this
experience at this time,

00:29:51.020 --> 00:29:54.350 align:middle line:84%
to overcome these
shadows of ourselves--

00:29:54.350 --> 00:29:55.370 align:middle line:90%
until we can embrace--

00:29:55.370 --> 00:29:57.620 align:middle line:84%
>>HARVEY: I don't think you
ever overcome the shadows.

00:29:57.620 --> 00:29:58.480 align:middle line:90%
I think you can only--

00:29:58.480 --> 00:29:58.750 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Accept?

00:29:58.750 --> 00:30:00.470 align:middle line:84%
>>HARVEY: --offer them up
for healing, consciously.

00:30:00.470 --> 00:30:02.136 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: OK, offer
them up for healing.

00:30:02.136 --> 00:30:04.940 align:middle line:84%
But until we acknowledge
that and can deal with that

00:30:04.940 --> 00:30:10.377 align:middle line:84%
in ourselves, it's very
difficult to be as generous

00:30:10.377 --> 00:30:12.710 align:middle line:84%
and forgiving-- I don't even
like the word forgiveness--

00:30:12.710 --> 00:30:13.680 align:middle line:84%
>>HARVEY: It's not
even forgiving--

00:30:13.680 --> 00:30:14.240 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: I don't
like that word.

00:30:14.240 --> 00:30:15.323 align:middle line:90%
>>HARVEY: --it's skillful.

00:30:15.323 --> 00:30:18.720 align:middle line:84%
You cannot be skillful with
people until you understand

00:30:18.720 --> 00:30:21.670 align:middle line:84%
that whatever you can't
stand in them, lives in you.

00:30:21.670 --> 00:30:25.240 align:middle line:84%
At which point, you have to
go to a very much deeper place

00:30:25.240 --> 00:30:26.800 align:middle line:90%
than judgment.

00:30:26.800 --> 00:30:28.310 align:middle line:90%
And God knows I love to judge.

00:30:28.310 --> 00:30:30.537 align:middle line:84%
And God knows I judge with
great ferocity in my life.

00:30:30.537 --> 00:30:31.870 align:middle line:90%
And mea culpa, mea maxima culpa.

00:30:31.870 --> 00:30:34.296 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: As have we at all.

00:30:34.296 --> 00:30:36.110 align:middle line:84%
>>HARVEY: But the
only way we'll ever

00:30:36.110 --> 00:30:40.340 align:middle line:84%
be skillful with people--
anybody is by understanding why

00:30:40.340 --> 00:30:42.790 align:middle line:84%
they're driven to do
the things they do,

00:30:42.790 --> 00:30:47.090 align:middle line:84%
by understanding the part
of them that is in us.

00:30:47.090 --> 00:30:51.170 align:middle line:84%
And from that place of wisdom,
from that place of compassion,

00:30:51.170 --> 00:30:54.860 align:middle line:84%
from that place of
beady-eyed self-knowledge--

00:30:54.860 --> 00:30:56.640 align:middle line:84%
which is also
knowledge of them--

00:30:56.640 --> 00:31:00.852 align:middle line:84%
we can evolve very, very
beautiful, skillful means

00:31:00.852 --> 00:31:04.320 align:middle line:84%
of holding people accountable
without damning them.

00:31:04.320 --> 00:31:05.820 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Exactly,
and that really--

00:31:05.820 --> 00:31:07.361 align:middle line:84%
>>HARVEY: And that
is very important.

00:31:07.361 --> 00:31:09.124 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: That's the piece--

00:31:09.124 --> 00:31:10.290 align:middle line:90%
>>HARVEY: That is the piece.

00:31:10.290 --> 00:31:11.790 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: --that
has to be embraced,

00:31:11.790 --> 00:31:12.873 align:middle line:90%
whether we like it or not.

00:31:12.873 --> 00:31:15.424 align:middle line:84%
>>HARVEY: The New Age says,
it's all in God's order.

00:31:15.424 --> 00:31:16.340 align:middle line:90%
They're all wonderful.

00:31:16.340 --> 00:31:17.035 align:middle line:90%
They're all the divine.

00:31:17.035 --> 00:31:17.950 align:middle line:90%
This is bullshit.

00:31:17.950 --> 00:31:19.210 align:middle line:90%
This is nonsense.

00:31:19.210 --> 00:31:22.380 align:middle line:84%
Because some people
have, by their choices,

00:31:22.380 --> 00:31:24.790 align:middle line:84%
made themselves the
instrument of the dark.

00:31:24.790 --> 00:31:27.900 align:middle line:84%
And the dark is real both in
the transcendental, very high

00:31:27.900 --> 00:31:30.220 align:middle line:90%
levels and also in this level.

00:31:30.220 --> 00:31:35.210 align:middle line:84%
But even there, you
can redeem the dark.

00:31:35.210 --> 00:31:36.940 align:middle line:84%
By redeeming the
darkness in yourself

00:31:36.940 --> 00:31:40.800 align:middle line:84%
and learning how you do that
and constantly, constantly,

00:31:40.800 --> 00:31:43.430 align:middle line:84%
constantly committing
yourself-- like the Dalai Lama

00:31:43.430 --> 00:31:45.840 align:middle line:84%
does with the Chinese,
like Martin Luther King

00:31:45.840 --> 00:31:48.690 align:middle line:84%
did with the Southern
whites, like Gandhi

00:31:48.690 --> 00:31:51.840 align:middle line:84%
did with the British-- to
offering the very people who

00:31:51.840 --> 00:31:54.900 align:middle line:84%
are doing the
destruction ways out

00:31:54.900 --> 00:31:56.430 align:middle line:84%
that not only stop
the destruction,

00:31:56.430 --> 00:31:58.320 align:middle line:84%
but also stop their
destroying themselves.

00:31:58.320 --> 00:31:59.195 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Absolutely.

00:31:59.195 --> 00:32:00.470 align:middle line:84%
>>HARVEY: And that's
very important.

00:32:00.470 --> 00:32:01.420 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: And it's a process.

00:32:01.420 --> 00:32:03.050 align:middle line:10%
It's a crossover
period of history.

00:32:03.050 --> 00:32:05.760 align:middle line:10%
It's not going to immediately
transcend and heal.

00:32:05.760 --> 00:32:08.404 align:middle line:10%
We're still working
within existing structures

00:32:08.404 --> 00:32:09.820 align:middle line:10%
and infrastructures,
many of which

00:32:09.820 --> 00:32:11.330 align:middle line:10%
are burning down, as
we've talked about before.

00:32:11.330 --> 00:32:12.050 align:middle line:10%
>>HARVEY: But the
very big problem,

00:32:12.050 --> 00:32:13.730 align:middle line:10%
and you know this
as well as I do,

00:32:13.730 --> 00:32:15.595 align:middle line:10%
is that we have so little time.

00:32:15.595 --> 00:32:16.290 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:32:16.290 --> 00:32:18.740 align:middle line:84%
>>HARVEY: This transformation--
we don't have the luxury

00:32:18.740 --> 00:32:21.930 align:middle line:84%
to sit back and say, oh, this
is a difficult transition.

00:32:21.930 --> 00:32:24.310 align:middle line:84%
There are all these things
that have to be worked out.

00:32:24.310 --> 00:32:26.140 align:middle line:90%
Give us a few hundred years.

00:32:26.140 --> 00:32:28.630 align:middle line:10%
We don't have a
few hundred years.

00:32:28.630 --> 00:32:32.370 align:middle line:10%
By two thirty, most of
the forest of the Amazon

00:32:32.370 --> 00:32:33.950 align:middle line:10%
is going to be burnt down.

00:32:33.950 --> 00:32:36.320 align:middle line:10%
By then, the rest of the
seas will be polluted.

00:32:36.320 --> 00:32:37.010 align:middle line:10%
>>REGINA: The lungs
are gone in that case.

00:32:37.010 --> 00:32:38.218 align:middle line:10%
>>HARVEY: The lungs are gone.

00:32:38.218 --> 00:32:43.620 align:middle line:84%
So this transformation has to
go very fast, very urgently.

00:32:43.620 --> 00:32:46.460 align:middle line:84%
And at the moment,
I have to say,

00:32:46.460 --> 00:32:49.300 align:middle line:84%
there are very little signs
that it's going fast enough.

00:32:49.300 --> 00:32:51.970 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Well, let me ask
you this, because I've said--

00:32:51.970 --> 00:32:54.280 align:middle line:84%
>>HARVEY: And, you
know, I pray constantly

00:32:54.280 --> 00:32:55.360 align:middle line:90%
to be illumined on that.

00:32:55.360 --> 00:32:56.350 align:middle line:90%
But I'm not depressed.

00:32:56.350 --> 00:32:58.550 align:middle line:84%
I'm just saying the
truth as I see it.

00:32:58.550 --> 00:33:02.970 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Yes, and one thing
I've commented on many times

00:33:02.970 --> 00:33:06.160 align:middle line:84%
is that I hold a
great amount of hope

00:33:06.160 --> 00:33:09.100 align:middle line:84%
in the youth, the new type of
beings that are being born.

00:33:09.100 --> 00:33:10.280 align:middle line:90%
>>HARVEY: I agree with you.

00:33:10.280 --> 00:33:14.480 align:middle line:84%
>>HARVEY: I'm seeing a kind
of generosity between them.

00:33:14.480 --> 00:33:21.294 align:middle line:84%
And I don't have words exactly
beyond the word generosity.

00:33:21.294 --> 00:33:23.210 align:middle line:84%
They have a more open
spirit with each other--

00:33:23.210 --> 00:33:23.770 align:middle line:90%
>>HARVEY: Oh, very much.

00:33:23.770 --> 00:33:25.520 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: --and embrace
each other in ways

00:33:25.520 --> 00:33:27.470 align:middle line:84%
that previous
generations have not.

00:33:27.470 --> 00:33:29.840 align:middle line:84%
Now, there's evidence
that their DNA

00:33:29.840 --> 00:33:31.840 align:middle line:84%
may be coming in at a
more active rate, as well.

00:33:31.840 --> 00:33:32.673 align:middle line:90%
>>HARVEY: It may be.

00:33:32.673 --> 00:33:35.080 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So we're going
through a genuine transformation

00:33:35.080 --> 00:33:35.950 align:middle line:90%
as a species.

00:33:35.950 --> 00:33:38.640 align:middle line:84%
And I'd like you to comment
on what you see in the youth

00:33:38.640 --> 00:33:39.160 align:middle line:90%
right now.

00:33:39.160 --> 00:33:41.240 align:middle line:84%
>>HARVEY: Well, I see
two kinds of youth.

00:33:41.240 --> 00:33:44.270 align:middle line:84%
One, absolutely
destroyed by our culture.

00:33:44.270 --> 00:33:45.857 align:middle line:84%
And we've been
talking about them.

00:33:45.857 --> 00:33:46.440 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:33:46.440 --> 00:33:49.030 align:middle line:84%
>>HARVEY: The other,
amazingly awake.

00:33:49.030 --> 00:33:53.600 align:middle line:84%
Because they start
where we left off.

00:33:53.600 --> 00:33:57.170 align:middle line:84%
They have the sexual
liberation in their genes.

00:33:57.170 --> 00:33:59.950 align:middle line:84%
They have the great
transformational liberation

00:33:59.950 --> 00:34:02.530 align:middle line:84%
of the best part of the
New Age in their genes.

00:34:02.530 --> 00:34:05.130 align:middle line:84%
And they have been
deeply disillusioned

00:34:05.130 --> 00:34:08.234 align:middle line:84%
by the so-called American dream,
or the dream of capitalism.

00:34:08.234 --> 00:34:09.650 align:middle line:84%
Because they see
it's not working.

00:34:09.650 --> 00:34:12.960 align:middle line:84%
They know perfectly well that
we're destroying the planet.

00:34:12.960 --> 00:34:17.949 align:middle line:84%
But it seems they're being
fed by secret divine sources.

00:34:17.949 --> 00:34:18.840 align:middle line:90%
They have energy.

00:34:18.840 --> 00:34:20.300 align:middle line:90%
They have generosity.

00:34:20.300 --> 00:34:23.130 align:middle line:84%
They're very open to ideas
like the gift economy,

00:34:23.130 --> 00:34:25.179 align:middle line:84%
like alternative
forms of living.

00:34:25.179 --> 00:34:27.670 align:middle line:84%
And the best of
Occupy, I think-- and I

00:34:27.670 --> 00:34:30.850 align:middle line:84%
spoke at a lot of
occupied places--

00:34:30.850 --> 00:34:34.070 align:middle line:84%
is that you see, in
Occupy at its best,

00:34:34.070 --> 00:34:36.199 align:middle line:90%
this new energy, this passion.

00:34:36.199 --> 00:34:37.730 align:middle line:90%
You see it in the Arab Spring.

00:34:37.730 --> 00:34:39.730 align:middle line:84%
We all know what's happening
to the Arab Spring.

00:34:39.730 --> 00:34:40.899 align:middle line:90%
It's been co-opted.

00:34:40.899 --> 00:34:42.024 align:middle line:90%
And it's been extinguished.

00:34:42.024 --> 00:34:42.899 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Completely.

00:34:42.899 --> 00:34:45.790 align:middle line:84%
>>HARVEY: But in other
parts of the world,

00:34:45.790 --> 00:34:48.699 align:middle line:84%
for example, in
Algeria and in Tunisia,

00:34:48.699 --> 00:34:51.580 align:middle line:84%
there are major,
moderate Islamic parties

00:34:51.580 --> 00:34:53.449 align:middle line:90%
starting because of the young.

00:34:53.449 --> 00:34:56.810 align:middle line:84%
So it's not extinguishable,
this new energy

00:34:56.810 --> 00:34:58.030 align:middle line:90%
coming through the young.

00:34:58.030 --> 00:35:04.390 align:middle line:84%
And I hope to God that they will
become disciplined and focused

00:35:04.390 --> 00:35:07.760 align:middle line:84%
and realize that the powers
that rage against them

00:35:07.760 --> 00:35:10.610 align:middle line:84%
are very strong and demand
a really greater clarity

00:35:10.610 --> 00:35:12.675 align:middle line:84%
and organization than,
for example, Occupy had.

00:35:12.675 --> 00:35:13.550 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Absolutely.

00:35:13.550 --> 00:35:15.500 align:middle line:84%
>>HARVEY: You've
got to get savvy.

00:35:15.500 --> 00:35:17.800 align:middle line:84%
We're not dealing
with sweethearts.

00:35:17.800 --> 00:35:20.680 align:middle line:84%
We're dealing with very
powerful, cold-blooded,

00:35:20.680 --> 00:35:23.130 align:middle line:90%
laser-hearted maniacs, right?

00:35:23.130 --> 00:35:24.840 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Yes, and
they do understand

00:35:24.840 --> 00:35:26.700 align:middle line:84%
all the systems
are failing them.

00:35:26.700 --> 00:35:29.660 align:middle line:84%
There's nothing they can
fall on or rely on, not even

00:35:29.660 --> 00:35:30.984 align:middle line:90%
finding a job out of college.

00:35:30.984 --> 00:35:31.650 align:middle line:90%
That's a luxury.

00:35:31.650 --> 00:35:32.690 align:middle line:84%
>>HARVEY: And they're sick
to death of the baby boomer

00:35:32.690 --> 00:35:34.690 align:middle line:84%
generation because they
know perfectly well how

00:35:34.690 --> 00:35:36.560 align:middle line:84%
narcissistic New
Age spirituality is.

00:35:36.560 --> 00:35:37.560 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Their parents.

00:35:37.560 --> 00:35:38.690 align:middle line:90%
>>HARVEY: --parents are.

00:35:38.690 --> 00:35:41.000 align:middle line:84%
And they know that as long
as their parents can smoke

00:35:41.000 --> 00:35:43.940 align:middle line:84%
pot and buy whole foods,
they're not going to do much.

00:35:43.940 --> 00:35:46.530 align:middle line:84%
And they're depressed as
heaven by what they're seeing.

00:35:46.530 --> 00:35:48.380 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Yes, many of them
do seem to be depressed.

00:35:48.380 --> 00:35:50.338 align:middle line:84%
>>HARVEY: But they're
are also doing something.

00:35:50.338 --> 00:35:52.820 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Mmm, and there's
another element with them.

00:35:52.820 --> 00:35:56.570 align:middle line:84%
They are the generation that
has brought in transparency,

00:35:56.570 --> 00:36:00.110 align:middle line:84%
whether it is in an infantile
way through Facebook,

00:36:00.110 --> 00:36:03.720 align:middle line:84%
and Twitter, and
other mechanisms

00:36:03.720 --> 00:36:05.230 align:middle line:84%
for sharing every
single thing you

00:36:05.230 --> 00:36:07.810 align:middle line:84%
do in a given day
with each other.

00:36:07.810 --> 00:36:12.620 align:middle line:84%
The point is, they're not
trying to hold back and hide

00:36:12.620 --> 00:36:14.555 align:middle line:90%
the truth of what they are.

00:36:14.555 --> 00:36:17.510 align:middle line:84%
>>HARVEY: No, but don't you
think we can't just sit back.

00:36:17.510 --> 00:36:18.610 align:middle line:90%
And I'm 60.

00:36:18.610 --> 00:36:20.742 align:middle line:90%
And you're only 42, so it's OK.

00:36:20.742 --> 00:36:21.450 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Barely.

00:36:21.450 --> 00:36:23.660 align:middle line:84%
>>HARVEY: But we can't
sit back as elders

00:36:23.660 --> 00:36:26.120 align:middle line:84%
and say, oh, the
young will do it.

00:36:26.120 --> 00:36:29.339 align:middle line:84%
Because what about all
those rich baby-boomers?

00:36:29.339 --> 00:36:31.130 align:middle line:84%
What are they going to
do with their money?

00:36:31.130 --> 00:36:33.800 align:middle line:84%
Are they going to golf
while the world burns?

00:36:33.800 --> 00:36:38.080 align:middle line:84%
Or just go off to Tahiti with
spurious spiritual teachers

00:36:38.080 --> 00:36:41.270 align:middle line:90%
to jipe up their tantric juices?

00:36:41.270 --> 00:36:42.360 align:middle line:90%
What are they going to do?

00:36:42.360 --> 00:36:44.410 align:middle line:84%
They have the power,
they have the money.

00:36:44.410 --> 00:36:46.440 align:middle line:84%
When are they going to
wake up and actually

00:36:46.440 --> 00:36:47.670 align:middle line:84%
start dedicating
their energies to--

00:36:47.670 --> 00:36:48.730 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: No, I agree with you.

00:36:48.730 --> 00:36:50.521 align:middle line:84%
I don't think we should
wait for the youth.

00:36:50.521 --> 00:36:53.260 align:middle line:84%
I think they're an important--
it's an important force

00:36:53.260 --> 00:36:54.180 align:middle line:90%
to recognize.

00:36:54.180 --> 00:36:55.400 align:middle line:90%
They are among us.

00:36:55.400 --> 00:36:56.730 align:middle line:90%
And they are offering--

00:36:56.730 --> 00:36:57.220 align:middle line:84%
>>HARVEY: It's a
source of great hope.

00:36:57.220 --> 00:36:58.180 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: It's a
source of great hope.

00:36:58.180 --> 00:37:00.220 align:middle line:84%
>>HARVEY: But they
also need our wisdom.

00:37:00.220 --> 00:37:03.510 align:middle line:84%
And until we get really wise,
which is really getting down,

00:37:03.510 --> 00:37:08.020 align:middle line:84%
until we start being real
elders and real no-nonsense

00:37:08.020 --> 00:37:13.240 align:middle line:84%
truth-tellers, and until we
start really walking our talk,

00:37:13.240 --> 00:37:17.060 align:middle line:84%
their energy will not
get the wise wisdom

00:37:17.060 --> 00:37:18.860 align:middle line:90%
that it needs, the wise help.

00:37:18.860 --> 00:37:20.240 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: --the guidance
and counsel that it needs.

00:37:20.240 --> 00:37:20.960 align:middle line:84%
>>HARVEY: The
guidance and counsel--

00:37:20.960 --> 00:37:23.280 align:middle line:84%
so we need an alliance,
at the very deepest level,

00:37:23.280 --> 00:37:25.870 align:middle line:84%
between the wild, gorgeous,
hopeful energy of the young

00:37:25.870 --> 00:37:30.880 align:middle line:84%
and the prudent, no-nonsense,
and half bitchy clarity

00:37:30.880 --> 00:37:33.710 align:middle line:84%
of those who have weathered
the storms of life.

00:37:33.710 --> 00:37:35.540 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Yes, and
it's interesting, too.

00:37:35.540 --> 00:37:37.650 align:middle line:84%
Because if you look at
this transformation--

00:37:37.650 --> 00:37:40.300 align:middle line:84%
this global transformation of
the environment, et cetera,

00:37:40.300 --> 00:37:43.470 align:middle line:84%
it requires the bringing
in of new technologies.

00:37:43.470 --> 00:37:45.610 align:middle line:84%
We know-- I know from
my work-- because I

00:37:45.610 --> 00:37:48.150 align:middle line:84%
have access to a lot
of underground sources

00:37:48.150 --> 00:37:50.850 align:middle line:84%
of information-- a lot
of those technologies

00:37:50.850 --> 00:37:53.120 align:middle line:84%
not only exists now,
they've existed for decades.

00:37:53.120 --> 00:37:53.750 align:middle line:90%
>>HARVEY: For 30, 40 years.

00:37:53.750 --> 00:37:54.249 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

00:37:54.249 --> 00:37:57.540 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And in some cases,
even 100 years and beyond.

00:37:57.540 --> 00:37:59.250 align:middle line:90%
And they have been suppressed.

00:37:59.250 --> 00:38:01.800 align:middle line:84%
But the point that
some make-- and I

00:38:01.800 --> 00:38:03.460 align:middle line:84%
would like to get
your take on this--

00:38:03.460 --> 00:38:08.050 align:middle line:84%
is that when you take truly
profound technologies that

00:38:08.050 --> 00:38:13.360 align:middle line:84%
have the power to heal, to power
the planet, literally, and also

00:38:13.360 --> 00:38:17.610 align:middle line:84%
equally destructive potentials,
when does-- what does

00:38:17.610 --> 00:38:20.570 align:middle line:84%
it take for that
to safely emerge?

00:38:20.570 --> 00:38:23.700 align:middle line:84%
We are not conscious enough
on some levels for some of it.

00:38:23.700 --> 00:38:27.080 align:middle line:84%
>>HARVEY: Well, it cannot emerge
safely without a spiritual

00:38:27.080 --> 00:38:27.705 align:middle line:90%
transformation.

00:38:27.705 --> 00:38:30.970 align:middle line:84%
We have to go through
a profound shift

00:38:30.970 --> 00:38:35.025 align:middle line:84%
in spiritual consciousness,
which will teach us that never

00:38:35.025 --> 00:38:39.460 align:middle line:84%
again will we use the power
of technology to serve power.

00:38:39.460 --> 00:38:42.100 align:middle line:84%
It has to serve love,
harmony, balance,

00:38:42.100 --> 00:38:44.350 align:middle line:84%
and a wise relationship
with nature.

00:38:44.350 --> 00:38:46.860 align:middle line:84%
Otherwise, we will
reproduce this situation

00:38:46.860 --> 00:38:48.910 align:middle line:84%
and again come to
a place where we

00:38:48.910 --> 00:38:51.490 align:middle line:84%
are threatened
with annihilation.

00:38:51.490 --> 00:38:54.690 align:middle line:84%
So there is no way
out except through

00:38:54.690 --> 00:38:57.100 align:middle line:84%
a great evolutionary
transformation

00:38:57.100 --> 00:38:59.690 align:middle line:84%
in consciousness, which
results in a great burst

00:38:59.690 --> 00:39:01.570 align:middle line:84%
of sacred activism,
which results

00:39:01.570 --> 00:39:05.760 align:middle line:84%
in a transformed world, which
results in beings who truly

00:39:05.760 --> 00:39:08.800 align:middle line:84%
have been humbled by tragedy
and heartbreak and horror

00:39:08.800 --> 00:39:12.070 align:middle line:84%
enough to realize that
the divine will give you

00:39:12.070 --> 00:39:15.470 align:middle line:84%
divine consciousness and
divine power in a safe way

00:39:15.470 --> 00:39:18.990 align:middle line:84%
only if you are in a
truly humble position,

00:39:18.990 --> 00:39:21.430 align:middle line:84%
serving the laws of
justice and compassion

00:39:21.430 --> 00:39:23.760 align:middle line:84%
and harmony and
balance and reality.

00:39:23.760 --> 00:39:27.466 align:middle line:84%
Otherwise, you are
in terrible danger.

00:39:27.466 --> 00:39:29.340 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Well, when
people hear those words,

00:39:29.340 --> 00:39:31.610 align:middle line:84%
it brings up the
subject of fear.

00:39:31.610 --> 00:39:35.910 align:middle line:84%
Do you believe that there
is a proper motivating place

00:39:35.910 --> 00:39:36.620 align:middle line:90%
for fear?

00:39:36.620 --> 00:39:37.370 align:middle line:90%
Even though--

00:39:37.370 --> 00:39:39.260 align:middle line:90%
>>HARVEY: Of course.

00:39:39.260 --> 00:39:42.090 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: --part of our
enlightenment process

00:39:42.090 --> 00:39:45.440 align:middle line:84%
is to triumph over
fear as best we can?

00:39:45.440 --> 00:39:47.560 align:middle line:84%
It has to be there,
it seems to me, just

00:39:47.560 --> 00:39:50.359 align:middle line:84%
to motivate people to the next
level, where we are right now.

00:39:50.359 --> 00:39:52.650 align:middle line:84%
>>HARVEY: [LAUGHS] When you
hear these New Age teachers

00:39:52.650 --> 00:39:57.190 align:middle line:84%
saying, ah, choose love,
not fear-- actually, love

00:39:57.190 --> 00:40:00.110 align:middle line:84%
is what makes you
properly afraid.

00:40:00.110 --> 00:40:04.160 align:middle line:84%
I think the human race is
not nearly afraid enough.

00:40:04.160 --> 00:40:08.120 align:middle line:84%
If you truly love the creation,
if you truly love the seas,

00:40:08.120 --> 00:40:11.280 align:middle line:84%
if you truly love white lions,
if you truly love the poor,

00:40:11.280 --> 00:40:13.910 align:middle line:84%
if you truly, truly
love women, if you truly

00:40:13.910 --> 00:40:17.660 align:middle line:84%
love your gay friends,
you are terribly

00:40:17.660 --> 00:40:20.240 align:middle line:84%
afraid of the oppressive
structures that

00:40:20.240 --> 00:40:22.960 align:middle line:84%
are keeping such
destruction going.

00:40:22.960 --> 00:40:26.030 align:middle line:84%
And you're extremely
committed to ending them,

00:40:26.030 --> 00:40:28.890 align:middle line:84%
so that your great
love can flower

00:40:28.890 --> 00:40:31.960 align:middle line:90%
in real truth in reality.

00:40:31.960 --> 00:40:36.020 align:middle line:84%
Also, if you're not afraid
of the destructive and lethal

00:40:36.020 --> 00:40:38.700 align:middle line:84%
power of your shadow, the
shadow of human beings,

00:40:38.700 --> 00:40:40.400 align:middle line:84%
and the shadow of
the power structures

00:40:40.400 --> 00:40:43.580 align:middle line:84%
that we've created out of
our shadow, you're insane.

00:40:43.580 --> 00:40:45.080 align:middle line:90%
You're living in Lala Land.

00:40:45.080 --> 00:40:48.630 align:middle line:84%
You're in some other
planet, which is not real.

00:40:48.630 --> 00:40:52.330 align:middle line:84%
You're smoking some
very bad crack.

00:40:52.330 --> 00:40:57.500 align:middle line:84%
And if you're not
afraid of truly, truly

00:40:57.500 --> 00:41:03.070 align:middle line:84%
betraying the deep awakened
self within you by corruption,

00:41:03.070 --> 00:41:08.590 align:middle line:84%
or by being seduced by power, or
by meaningless pursuit of sex,

00:41:08.590 --> 00:41:10.750 align:middle line:84%
drugs, rock and
roll when you really

00:41:10.750 --> 00:41:13.990 align:middle line:84%
need to be devoting yourself
to justice and compassion,

00:41:13.990 --> 00:41:16.510 align:middle line:90%
again, you have lost everything.

00:41:16.510 --> 00:41:19.205 align:middle line:84%
So there are many
kinds of fear that

00:41:19.205 --> 00:41:23.190 align:middle line:84%
are absolutely indispensable
to real enlightenment.

00:41:23.190 --> 00:41:25.610 align:middle line:84%
In fact, one day, I
asked the Dalai Lama

00:41:25.610 --> 00:41:29.340 align:middle line:84%
what the enlightened
consciousness was like.

00:41:29.340 --> 00:41:32.280 align:middle line:84%
And he said, the
enlightened person

00:41:32.280 --> 00:41:37.370 align:middle line:84%
is at once deeply, deeply
free and very scrupulous

00:41:37.370 --> 00:41:41.060 align:middle line:84%
about every single
thought and action.

00:41:41.060 --> 00:41:45.400 align:middle line:84%
Because the enlightened person
knows exactly how powerful

00:41:45.400 --> 00:41:46.830 align:middle line:84%
every thought and
action is, which

00:41:46.830 --> 00:41:51.080 align:middle line:84%
means that the enlightened
person is, in a deep sense,

00:41:51.080 --> 00:41:55.400 align:middle line:84%
afraid of not aligning with
the truth at every moment,

00:41:55.400 --> 00:42:00.020 align:middle line:84%
because he or she knows that not
to be aligned in that deepest

00:42:00.020 --> 00:42:04.270 align:middle line:84%
sense is to spread ignorance,
confusion, and delusion.

00:42:04.270 --> 00:42:05.812 align:middle line:84%
So that's a very
proper kind of fear.

00:42:05.812 --> 00:42:06.280 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Absolutely.

00:42:06.280 --> 00:42:08.245 align:middle line:84%
In some ancient
traditions, even negative

00:42:08.245 --> 00:42:13.430 align:middle line:84%
thought-- just negative thought
is considered black magic.

00:42:13.430 --> 00:42:15.440 align:middle line:84%
>>HARVEY: Yes, well, I
think it is black magic.

00:42:15.440 --> 00:42:17.689 align:middle line:84%
And I think the more you
understand about your thought

00:42:17.689 --> 00:42:20.197 align:middle line:84%
process-- I don't mean
negative thought about,

00:42:20.197 --> 00:42:21.530 align:middle line:90%
oh my god, the world is burning.

00:42:21.530 --> 00:42:23.740 align:middle line:84%
We need to have those thoughts,
because it's very important.

00:42:23.740 --> 00:42:25.850 align:middle line:84%
But negative thought
about I hate that person.

00:42:25.850 --> 00:42:27.120 align:middle line:90%
Or I judge that person.

00:42:27.120 --> 00:42:29.090 align:middle line:84%
Or I wish that person
was hit on the head 17

00:42:29.090 --> 00:42:29.727 align:middle line:90%
times with a saucepan.

00:42:29.727 --> 00:42:29.980 align:middle line:90%
That's not helpful.

00:42:29.980 --> 00:42:31.855 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So I can have
their stuff. [LAUGHS]

00:42:31.855 --> 00:42:32.570 align:middle line:90%
>>HARVEY: Yes.

00:42:32.570 --> 00:42:35.650 align:middle line:84%
But you have to understand
that all thoughts do

00:42:35.650 --> 00:42:38.380 align:middle line:84%
have that profound
consequence and that you

00:42:38.380 --> 00:42:40.760 align:middle line:84%
have to constantly
align yourself

00:42:40.760 --> 00:42:42.520 align:middle line:84%
with the truth of
your essential nature.

00:42:42.520 --> 00:42:44.730 align:middle line:84%
And for everybody,
including, I imagine,

00:42:44.730 --> 00:42:47.600 align:middle line:90%
the Dalai Lama, that's hard.

00:42:47.600 --> 00:42:48.720 align:middle line:90%
It requires constant work.

00:42:48.720 --> 00:42:49.390 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Well, we're human.

00:42:49.390 --> 00:42:51.775 align:middle line:84%
We are still here and embodied
in human form, of course.

00:42:51.775 --> 00:42:54.399 align:middle line:84%
>>HARVEY: Well, we're human with
enormous shadows that actually

00:42:54.399 --> 00:42:56.514 align:middle line:90%
grow larger the higher you go.

00:42:56.514 --> 00:42:58.180 align:middle line:84%
It's not that you
ever lose your shadow.

00:42:58.180 --> 00:42:58.620 align:middle line:90%
In fact--

00:42:58.620 --> 00:42:59.760 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: --the
greater the contrast!

00:42:59.760 --> 00:43:00.850 align:middle line:84%
>>HARVEY: --the further
you go into the light,

00:43:00.850 --> 00:43:02.849 align:middle line:84%
the greater the shadow
you take and the more you

00:43:02.849 --> 00:43:05.060 align:middle line:84%
have to absorb of the
darkness within you.

00:43:05.060 --> 00:43:07.620 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So let's talk
about the global aspect

00:43:07.620 --> 00:43:09.020 align:middle line:90%
of sacred activism.

00:43:09.020 --> 00:43:11.030 align:middle line:84%
From your perception,
you're traveling

00:43:11.030 --> 00:43:13.760 align:middle line:84%
around the world lecturing
all the time, what is actually

00:43:13.760 --> 00:43:14.680 align:middle line:90%
taking root?

00:43:14.680 --> 00:43:17.030 align:middle line:84%
And then, we have
probably about 10 minutes

00:43:17.030 --> 00:43:18.550 align:middle line:90%
or so left in our conversation.

00:43:18.550 --> 00:43:20.340 align:middle line:84%
Let's talk about
that and how people

00:43:20.340 --> 00:43:23.107 align:middle line:84%
can become involved in
and of themselves, just

00:43:23.107 --> 00:43:23.940 align:middle line:90%
personally involved.

00:43:23.940 --> 00:43:26.080 align:middle line:90%
>>HARVEY: Well, I am lecturing.

00:43:26.080 --> 00:43:27.360 align:middle line:90%
But most of all, I'm training.

00:43:27.360 --> 00:43:29.720 align:middle line:84%
Because at this moment,
what is essential

00:43:29.720 --> 00:43:33.890 align:middle line:84%
is not to speak to people,
but to help people train.

00:43:33.890 --> 00:43:36.480 align:middle line:84%
Because what I'm trying
to do in my institute

00:43:36.480 --> 00:43:39.600 align:middle line:84%
and all around the
world is to help people

00:43:39.600 --> 00:43:42.360 align:middle line:84%
get down with the
situation, equip themselves

00:43:42.360 --> 00:43:46.000 align:middle line:84%
with the practices they need,
and start doing something

00:43:46.000 --> 00:43:49.752 align:middle line:84%
with others to begin the
great transfiguration.

00:43:49.752 --> 00:43:51.210 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: What are
some expressions

00:43:51.210 --> 00:43:52.420 align:middle line:84%
of this that are
occurring right now?

00:43:52.420 --> 00:43:54.045 align:middle line:84%
>>HARVEY: Well, what's
really important

00:43:54.045 --> 00:43:57.790 align:middle line:84%
is that I think people
need to understand the five

00:43:57.790 --> 00:43:59.890 align:middle line:84%
kinds of service
that anybody can

00:43:59.890 --> 00:44:01.935 align:middle line:90%
do to become a sacred activist.

00:44:01.935 --> 00:44:03.090 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Please share.

00:44:03.090 --> 00:44:04.990 align:middle line:84%
>>HARVEY: The first
is to really serve

00:44:04.990 --> 00:44:07.800 align:middle line:84%
the divine with love and
thanksgiving and praise.

00:44:07.800 --> 00:44:11.970 align:middle line:84%
Because if you do, if you open
your heart all the time to God,

00:44:11.970 --> 00:44:14.560 align:middle line:84%
God will shower you with
wisdom and energy and joy.

00:44:14.560 --> 00:44:17.690 align:middle line:84%
And you'll be guided to what you
need for your transformation.

00:44:17.690 --> 00:44:20.440 align:middle line:84%
The second kind of service--
and this is very, very important

00:44:20.440 --> 00:44:25.400 align:middle line:84%
and many activists forget this--
is to really, really serve

00:44:25.400 --> 00:44:27.620 align:middle line:90%
your own instrument.

00:44:27.620 --> 00:44:31.140 align:middle line:84%
Because you must be
healthy emotionally,

00:44:31.140 --> 00:44:33.340 align:middle line:84%
psychologically,
spiritually to be

00:44:33.340 --> 00:44:37.160 align:middle line:84%
able to be the instrument
of divine transformation.

00:44:37.160 --> 00:44:39.030 align:middle line:84%
And that requires five
kinds of practice.

00:44:39.030 --> 00:44:42.220 align:middle line:84%
It requires cool practices
that help you calm down.

00:44:42.220 --> 00:44:44.530 align:middle line:84%
It requires hot
practices that help

00:44:44.530 --> 00:44:46.635 align:middle line:84%
you keep your heart
vibrant and juicy.

00:44:46.635 --> 00:44:49.060 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Give us
examples of both.

00:44:49.060 --> 00:44:51.880 align:middle line:84%
>>HARVEY: Cool practice--
meditation without images,

00:44:51.880 --> 00:44:53.610 align:middle line:90%
just watching your thoughts.

00:44:53.610 --> 00:44:56.060 align:middle line:84%
Walking meditation,
breathing meditation.

00:44:56.060 --> 00:44:58.390 align:middle line:84%
Hot practice is
practices that awaken

00:44:58.390 --> 00:45:02.230 align:middle line:84%
the passionate, sacred heart,
like the Sufi practices,

00:45:02.230 --> 00:45:05.120 align:middle line:84%
like the Christ practice of
working with the Sacred Heart,

00:45:05.120 --> 00:45:07.420 align:middle line:84%
like the Hindu practice
of saying the name of God

00:45:07.420 --> 00:45:09.010 align:middle line:90%
passionately in the heart.

00:45:09.010 --> 00:45:10.990 align:middle line:84%
Then, you need a
prayer practice.

00:45:10.990 --> 00:45:12.730 align:middle line:84%
Because you want
to align yourself

00:45:12.730 --> 00:45:14.030 align:middle line:90%
with the will of the Beloved.

00:45:14.030 --> 00:45:17.000 align:middle line:84%
Then, you need physical
practices like yoga and reiki

00:45:17.000 --> 00:45:19.900 align:middle line:84%
and all these practices
that can keep--

00:45:19.900 --> 00:45:22.550 align:middle line:84%
or sacred dance-- that
can keep your body flowing

00:45:22.550 --> 00:45:23.909 align:middle line:90%
with the energies.

00:45:23.909 --> 00:45:25.200 align:middle line:90%
And then, you need shadow work.

00:45:25.200 --> 00:45:27.870 align:middle line:84%
Because you've got to be
working with shadow work.

00:45:27.870 --> 00:45:30.110 align:middle line:84%
Third kind of service
you need is really

00:45:30.110 --> 00:45:32.400 align:middle line:84%
a service to all
living, sentient beings,

00:45:32.400 --> 00:45:35.080 align:middle line:84%
human beings of every
kind, but also animals.

00:45:35.080 --> 00:45:37.300 align:middle line:84%
Because animals are in
a world-wide Auschwitz

00:45:37.300 --> 00:45:38.670 align:middle line:90%
of our making at this moment.

00:45:38.670 --> 00:45:41.060 align:middle line:84%
And if we don't
realize that we are

00:45:41.060 --> 00:45:43.680 align:middle line:84%
the Gauleiters of a horrible
Auschwitz in which we are

00:45:43.680 --> 00:45:46.550 align:middle line:84%
killing our brothers and sisters
in the most unspeakable way,

00:45:46.550 --> 00:45:48.380 align:middle line:90%
we are really out to lunch.

00:45:48.380 --> 00:45:49.250 align:middle line:90%
It's terrible.

00:45:49.250 --> 00:45:51.060 align:middle line:90%
It has to stop.

00:45:51.060 --> 00:45:54.114 align:middle line:84%
The fourth kind of
practice and service

00:45:54.114 --> 00:45:56.780 align:middle line:90%
is service to your community.

00:45:56.780 --> 00:45:59.400 align:middle line:90%
Think global, but act local.

00:45:59.400 --> 00:46:02.590 align:middle line:84%
And if you want to find
out what your mission is,

00:46:02.590 --> 00:46:06.930 align:middle line:84%
I invite people to wake up
at 3 o'clock in the morning,

00:46:06.930 --> 00:46:09.040 align:middle line:84%
to ground themselves in
the great peace of God,

00:46:09.040 --> 00:46:12.340 align:middle line:84%
and then ask themselves
one question, what,

00:46:12.340 --> 00:46:16.300 align:middle line:84%
of all the causes in the world,
breaks my heart the most?

00:46:16.300 --> 00:46:19.130 align:middle line:84%
Because what I've discovered and
what all the sacred activists

00:46:19.130 --> 00:46:21.420 align:middle line:84%
that I know have discovered
is that, when you identify

00:46:21.420 --> 00:46:26.000 align:middle line:84%
your deepest heartbreak, you
identify your most passionate

00:46:26.000 --> 00:46:26.785 align:middle line:90%
mission.

00:46:26.785 --> 00:46:28.620 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Is this
not the part that you

00:46:28.620 --> 00:46:30.270 align:middle line:90%
were talking about earlier?

00:46:30.270 --> 00:46:32.120 align:middle line:84%
That through your
contemplative practice,

00:46:32.120 --> 00:46:35.270 align:middle line:84%
you will be guided to in
your honoring of the divine?

00:46:35.270 --> 00:46:37.020 align:middle line:84%
>>HARVEY: You won't
always be guided to it

00:46:37.020 --> 00:46:39.340 align:middle line:84%
unless you know that
God is love in action.

00:46:39.340 --> 00:46:41.570 align:middle line:84%
Because many people
use contemplation

00:46:41.570 --> 00:46:44.390 align:middle line:84%
as another kind of heroin,
to sign off from engagement.

00:46:44.390 --> 00:46:46.770 align:middle line:84%
So unless you know
that God is the mother,

00:46:46.770 --> 00:46:50.010 align:middle line:84%
too, passionately in love
with justice and compassion

00:46:50.010 --> 00:46:52.627 align:middle line:84%
on every level, you might
be using your meditation

00:46:52.627 --> 00:46:53.960 align:middle line:90%
to sign off rather than sign on.

00:46:53.960 --> 00:46:55.085 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: No, that is true.

00:46:55.085 --> 00:46:56.930 align:middle line:84%
So that's why you'd
make the distinction,

00:46:56.930 --> 00:46:58.050 align:middle line:90%
3 o'clock in the morning?

00:46:58.050 --> 00:46:58.980 align:middle line:90%
The witching hour?

00:46:58.980 --> 00:46:59.540 align:middle line:84%
>>HARVEY: Yes,
the witching hour.

00:46:59.540 --> 00:47:00.160 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: The truth hour.

00:47:00.160 --> 00:47:02.340 align:middle line:84%
>>HARVEY: But also why I
ask the question like that.

00:47:02.340 --> 00:47:05.086 align:middle line:84%
Because in the New Age,
they say, find your bliss.

00:47:05.086 --> 00:47:07.460 align:middle line:84%
But the reality is you don't
find your bliss until you've

00:47:07.460 --> 00:47:09.240 align:middle line:90%
found your heartbreak first.

00:47:09.240 --> 00:47:13.140 align:middle line:84%
Because when you start
working for your heartbreak,

00:47:13.140 --> 00:47:14.960 align:middle line:84%
then you find the
greatest bliss of all,

00:47:14.960 --> 00:47:17.210 align:middle line:90%
which is to be love in action.

00:47:17.210 --> 00:47:19.340 align:middle line:84%
And then, the fifth
kind of service

00:47:19.340 --> 00:47:21.590 align:middle line:84%
is the service to
the whole birth,

00:47:21.590 --> 00:47:25.100 align:middle line:84%
to realize that all of
your actions and thoughts,

00:47:25.100 --> 00:47:28.000 align:middle line:84%
and all of your economic and
political and social choices,

00:47:28.000 --> 00:47:30.280 align:middle line:84%
have now to be aligned
with the new world

00:47:30.280 --> 00:47:33.900 align:middle line:84%
that you're trying to
dream into fruition.

00:47:33.900 --> 00:47:36.520 align:middle line:84%
Otherwise, you are
part of the problem

00:47:36.520 --> 00:47:38.570 align:middle line:90%
and not part of the solution.

00:47:38.570 --> 00:47:41.100 align:middle line:84%
If you believe-- if you're
sitting on your meditation

00:47:41.100 --> 00:47:46.600 align:middle line:84%
cushion having fantastic
intimations of emptiness

00:47:46.600 --> 00:47:49.800 align:middle line:84%
and you're still investing
your money in Monsanto,

00:47:49.800 --> 00:47:51.590 align:middle line:90%
there's something wrong.

00:47:51.590 --> 00:47:57.239 align:middle line:84%
If you're still riding a
polluting car excessively,

00:47:57.239 --> 00:47:57.780 align:middle line:90%
you're wrong.

00:47:57.780 --> 00:47:58.760 align:middle line:90%
You see what I'm saying?

00:47:58.760 --> 00:47:59.100 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:47:59.100 --> 00:48:00.800 align:middle line:84%
>>HARVEY: You have to get
your whole choices aligned

00:48:00.800 --> 00:48:01.120 align:middle line:90%
in the truth.

00:48:01.120 --> 00:48:01.825 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: You need
to be coherent.

00:48:01.825 --> 00:48:03.690 align:middle line:84%
>>HARVEY: You need
to be congruent.

00:48:03.690 --> 00:48:05.190 align:middle line:84%
And this is very
hard for all of us.

00:48:05.190 --> 00:48:06.160 align:middle line:90%
And we all fail.

00:48:06.160 --> 00:48:08.460 align:middle line:84%
But the more we
are, the more we're

00:48:08.460 --> 00:48:10.672 align:middle line:84%
aligned with this great,
evolutionary love-fire.

00:48:10.672 --> 00:48:12.130 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And, you
know, you've met

00:48:12.130 --> 00:48:16.130 align:middle line:84%
with people that are very
well-steeped in the world

00:48:16.130 --> 00:48:18.477 align:middle line:84%
of emerging, alternative
finance and such.

00:48:18.477 --> 00:48:19.060 align:middle line:90%
>>HARVEY: Yes.

00:48:19.060 --> 00:48:20.520 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And we know
some of the same people.

00:48:20.520 --> 00:48:22.830 align:middle line:84%
And there are really some
very beautiful movements--

00:48:22.830 --> 00:48:25.261 align:middle line:84%
>>HARVEY:
--extraordinary people.

00:48:25.261 --> 00:48:27.010 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: --waiting
for this consciousness

00:48:27.010 --> 00:48:28.310 align:middle line:90%
to emerge to support it.

00:48:28.310 --> 00:48:30.580 align:middle line:84%
It's not as though those
systems aren't there.

00:48:30.580 --> 00:48:33.220 align:middle line:84%
You talked earlier about
how our economic system

00:48:33.220 --> 00:48:35.510 align:middle line:84%
is going to burn to
ashes, which it should.

00:48:35.510 --> 00:48:37.920 align:middle line:84%
The way it's modeled
now, it probably should.

00:48:37.920 --> 00:48:38.460 align:middle line:90%
But--

00:48:38.460 --> 00:48:39.140 align:middle line:84%
>>HARVEY: There's
another economic system

00:48:39.140 --> 00:48:39.510 align:middle line:90%
waiting to come up.

00:48:39.510 --> 00:48:40.590 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: --at the
same time, there

00:48:40.590 --> 00:48:41.890 align:middle line:90%
are others coming up underneath.

00:48:41.890 --> 00:48:43.348 align:middle line:84%
>>HARVEY: Of course,
the phoenix is

00:48:43.348 --> 00:48:45.590 align:middle line:84%
going to rise, potentially,
out of the ashes.

00:48:45.590 --> 00:48:48.240 align:middle line:84%
And the phoenix, certainly
in economic terms,

00:48:48.240 --> 00:48:50.692 align:middle line:84%
looks like the amazing
work of Lietaer

00:48:50.692 --> 00:48:53.025 align:middle line:84%
and Charles Eisenstein, these
extraordinary visionaries.

00:48:53.025 --> 00:48:53.970 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Steven
Belgian and the work

00:48:53.970 --> 00:48:55.450 align:middle line:84%
he's done with
Lietaer and others.

00:48:55.450 --> 00:48:57.100 align:middle line:84%
>>HARVEY: Steven
Belgian, these people

00:48:57.100 --> 00:49:00.550 align:middle line:84%
are really, in a grounded
way, imagining a new world

00:49:00.550 --> 00:49:04.420 align:middle line:84%
based on the gift economy,
based on mutual responsibility,

00:49:04.420 --> 00:49:06.170 align:middle line:90%
based on mutual compassion.

00:49:06.170 --> 00:49:07.370 align:middle line:90%
And this is not fantasy.

00:49:07.370 --> 00:49:09.720 align:middle line:84%
Because when I was young
man, I went to the Himalayas

00:49:09.720 --> 00:49:11.300 align:middle line:90%
to a place called Ladakh.

00:49:11.300 --> 00:49:13.170 align:middle line:84%
And I saw people
living like this.

00:49:13.170 --> 00:49:14.910 align:middle line:90%
We have lived like this.

00:49:14.910 --> 00:49:17.440 align:middle line:84%
And we have been much
happier and much more joyful

00:49:17.440 --> 00:49:18.680 align:middle line:90%
than we are now.

00:49:18.680 --> 00:49:21.370 align:middle line:90%
This is also seeded in our DNA.

00:49:21.370 --> 00:49:24.630 align:middle line:84%
We're not just corrupt,
capitalistic dominators

00:49:24.630 --> 00:49:25.340 align:middle line:90%
and exploiters.

00:49:25.340 --> 00:49:27.320 align:middle line:84%
We've lived in
harmony with nature.

00:49:27.320 --> 00:49:29.490 align:middle line:84%
We've lived in harmony
with each other.

00:49:29.490 --> 00:49:31.030 align:middle line:90%
We've truly given to each other.

00:49:31.030 --> 00:49:33.255 align:middle line:84%
And it's this part of
the human being that

00:49:33.255 --> 00:49:35.740 align:middle line:84%
is going to come
forward-- I hope and pray.

00:49:35.740 --> 00:49:37.930 align:middle line:84%
And these systems are
being imagined right now.

00:49:37.930 --> 00:49:38.930 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes, they are.

00:49:38.930 --> 00:49:39.865 align:middle line:84%
>>HARVEY: This is the
most creative moment

00:49:39.865 --> 00:49:40.820 align:middle line:90%
in human history.

00:49:40.820 --> 00:49:41.370 align:middle line:90%
It's also the most devastating.

00:49:41.370 --> 00:49:43.036 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: It's
absolutely-- it's divine.

00:49:43.036 --> 00:49:45.600 align:middle line:84%
I mean, well, obviously,
it's divinely inspired.

00:49:45.600 --> 00:49:47.555 align:middle line:84%
And just bringing
Steven up for a moment

00:49:47.555 --> 00:49:49.730 align:middle line:84%
and talking about his
experience in life

00:49:49.730 --> 00:49:52.980 align:middle line:84%
and what he's had to heal within
himself-- to come to the point

00:49:52.980 --> 00:49:55.190 align:middle line:84%
to be able to offer
this when he says,

00:49:55.190 --> 00:49:59.630 align:middle line:84%
I carry all the information
of my tribe-- he's Jewish.

00:49:59.630 --> 00:50:01.900 align:middle line:84%
Yet, one of his greatest
spiritual brothers

00:50:01.900 --> 00:50:03.440 align:middle line:90%
is Palestinian.

00:50:03.440 --> 00:50:05.980 align:middle line:84%
And same thing, he has
another relationship

00:50:05.980 --> 00:50:09.030 align:middle line:84%
of a very divine order
with another person who

00:50:09.030 --> 00:50:12.410 align:middle line:84%
is a German man in this world
of business and economics.

00:50:12.410 --> 00:50:16.560 align:middle line:84%
But he said, this part has to
be present and healed within us

00:50:16.560 --> 00:50:18.294 align:middle line:84%
for this to work,
and within all of us.

00:50:18.294 --> 00:50:20.210 align:middle line:84%
>>HARVEY: Yes, we have
to make massive efforts

00:50:20.210 --> 00:50:22.950 align:middle line:84%
of reconciliation of the
opposites at every level for us

00:50:22.950 --> 00:50:25.005 align:middle line:84%
to have a hell of a
chance to get through it.

00:50:25.005 --> 00:50:25.880 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Absolutely.

00:50:25.880 --> 00:50:28.964 align:middle line:84%
OK, so tell us a little
bit about the Institute.

00:50:28.964 --> 00:50:31.130 align:middle line:84%
>>HARVEY: The Institute of
Sacred Activism-- and I'm

00:50:31.130 --> 00:50:33.450 align:middle line:84%
opening it all
over the world-- is

00:50:33.450 --> 00:50:36.710 align:middle line:84%
dedicated to training
sacred activists.

00:50:36.710 --> 00:50:39.230 align:middle line:84%
Fundamentally,
I've been involved

00:50:39.230 --> 00:50:42.920 align:middle line:84%
in initiation which lasts a
week and is in three parts,

00:50:42.920 --> 00:50:45.320 align:middle line:84%
like the initiation of
the ancient mysteries.

00:50:45.320 --> 00:50:48.049 align:middle line:84%
The first part is dedicated
to massive inspiration.

00:50:48.049 --> 00:50:49.590 align:middle line:84%
Because nobody's
going to do the work

00:50:49.590 --> 00:50:53.000 align:middle line:84%
unless they realize that
there's a huge beauty possible

00:50:53.000 --> 00:50:55.050 align:middle line:90%
and a great joy accessible.

00:50:55.050 --> 00:50:58.120 align:middle line:84%
The second part is
devoted to a descent

00:50:58.120 --> 00:50:59.590 align:middle line:90%
into where we really are.

00:50:59.590 --> 00:51:02.310 align:middle line:84%
And the third part is
devoted to the marriage

00:51:02.310 --> 00:51:05.510 align:middle line:84%
of the wisdom of the light with
the wisdom of the dark, focused

00:51:05.510 --> 00:51:07.630 align:middle line:90%
on real, compassionate action.

00:51:07.630 --> 00:51:09.735 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: But there's
only one of you, Andrew!

00:51:09.735 --> 00:51:11.124 align:middle line:90%
>>HARVEY: Oh, that's not true.

00:51:11.124 --> 00:51:13.162 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: I mean, one
very energetic one of you.

00:51:13.162 --> 00:51:14.870 align:middle line:84%
But do you have
ambassadors, so to speak,

00:51:14.870 --> 00:51:15.405 align:middle line:90%
who've been trained in--

00:51:15.405 --> 00:51:17.113 align:middle line:84%
>>HARVEY: Yes, I have
wonderful teachers,

00:51:17.113 --> 00:51:19.660 align:middle line:84%
wonderful people around,
wonderful yoga teachers,

00:51:19.660 --> 00:51:21.700 align:middle line:90%
wonderful meditation teachers.

00:51:21.700 --> 00:51:22.760 align:middle line:90%
I'm not unique.

00:51:22.760 --> 00:51:24.470 align:middle line:90%
There are many people working--

00:51:24.470 --> 00:51:25.290 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: That are
involved in this.

00:51:25.290 --> 00:51:26.540 align:middle line:90%
>>HARVEY: --in this territory.

00:51:26.540 --> 00:51:29.320 align:middle line:84%
What my job was, this life,
was to give the roadmap

00:51:29.320 --> 00:51:31.120 align:middle line:84%
to the human race,
as far as I could

00:51:31.120 --> 00:51:34.620 align:middle line:84%
with all my follies and
flaws, of sacred activism

00:51:34.620 --> 00:51:37.740 align:middle line:84%
and the transfiguration of the
world that it makes possible.

00:51:37.740 --> 00:51:38.990 align:middle line:90%
I am doing this.

00:51:38.990 --> 00:51:39.980 align:middle line:90%
And I have done this.

00:51:39.980 --> 00:51:41.780 align:middle line:90%
And I will continue to do this.

00:51:41.780 --> 00:51:43.065 align:middle line:90%
I don't do this as a guru.

00:51:43.065 --> 00:51:44.430 align:middle line:90%
I am not unique.

00:51:44.430 --> 00:51:47.365 align:middle line:84%
I do this as a fellow traveler
and as a brother and sister

00:51:47.365 --> 00:51:49.874 align:middle line:90%
of every single human being.

00:51:49.874 --> 00:51:50.915 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: And as a lover.

00:51:50.915 --> 00:51:52.637 align:middle line:90%
>>HARVEY: And as a lover--

00:51:52.637 --> 00:51:54.720 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And are there
any surprisingly fertile--

00:51:54.720 --> 00:51:55.720 align:middle line:90%
>>HARVEY: --of animals.

00:51:55.720 --> 00:51:56.803 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: --of all things.

00:51:56.803 --> 00:51:58.190 align:middle line:90%
>>HARVEY: Yeah, especially cats.

00:51:58.190 --> 00:51:59.481 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes, especially cats.

00:51:59.481 --> 00:52:00.770 align:middle line:90%
We have to get that there.

00:52:00.770 --> 00:52:01.811 align:middle line:90%
>>HARVEY: Cats and opera.

00:52:01.811 --> 00:52:02.930 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: --and opera.

00:52:02.930 --> 00:52:05.047 align:middle line:84%
Is there a particularly
fertile area

00:52:05.047 --> 00:52:07.380 align:middle line:84%
where this has taken seed
that might be very unexpected?

00:52:07.380 --> 00:52:09.200 align:middle line:84%
Just to give us a little
glimpse into what's possible?

00:52:09.200 --> 00:52:10.260 align:middle line:84%
>>HARVEY: Well, it's
beginning to take seed

00:52:10.260 --> 00:52:12.460 align:middle line:84%
in South Africa, which
is a very, very intensely

00:52:12.460 --> 00:52:13.870 align:middle line:90%
tragic situation.

00:52:13.870 --> 00:52:15.850 align:middle line:84%
It's beginning to
take seed in Poland,

00:52:15.850 --> 00:52:18.680 align:middle line:84%
which is also a very
stricken situation.

00:52:18.680 --> 00:52:21.130 align:middle line:84%
It's beginning to take seed
in Australia, because I'm

00:52:21.130 --> 00:52:24.590 align:middle line:84%
working with the Dalai Lama
of the Australian Aborigines.

00:52:24.590 --> 00:52:26.545 align:middle line:84%
And that is a very
comatose situation,

00:52:26.545 --> 00:52:27.920 align:middle line:90%
rather like the States.

00:52:27.920 --> 00:52:30.430 align:middle line:84%
The States is the most
difficult of all cultures

00:52:30.430 --> 00:52:34.330 align:middle line:84%
to work in because people are
really in a state of coma.

00:52:34.330 --> 00:52:36.380 align:middle line:84%
But even in the
States, it's growing.

00:52:36.380 --> 00:52:41.200 align:middle line:84%
Wonderful people like Adam Bucko
of the Reciprocity Homeless

00:52:41.200 --> 00:52:41.930 align:middle line:90%
Foundation.

00:52:41.930 --> 00:52:45.120 align:middle line:84%
He's doing extraordinary
sacred activism.

00:52:45.120 --> 00:52:49.324 align:middle line:84%
It's the new wave of truth,
the Second Wave as Chris Saade

00:52:49.324 --> 00:52:49.824 align:middle line:90%
says.

00:52:49.824 --> 00:52:50.660 align:middle line:90%
Millions of people--

00:52:50.660 --> 00:52:51.951 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Tell us that briefly.

00:52:51.951 --> 00:52:53.290 align:middle line:90%
We have a minute left.

00:52:53.290 --> 00:52:56.240 align:middle line:84%
>>HARVEY: The Second Wave is the
second wave after the New Age.

00:52:56.240 --> 00:52:58.067 align:middle line:84%
First, the New Age,
that first wave.

00:52:58.067 --> 00:53:00.150 align:middle line:84%
And then, it became
narcissistic and self-absorbed

00:53:00.150 --> 00:53:01.910 align:middle line:90%
and corporately dominated.

00:53:01.910 --> 00:53:06.070 align:middle line:84%
Now, the second wave, which
is the wave of love in action.

00:53:06.070 --> 00:53:08.740 align:middle line:84%
And there are many voices of
that, Matthew Fox, Dorothy

00:53:08.740 --> 00:53:12.860 align:middle line:84%
Soelle, Martin Luther
King, Desmond Tutu.

00:53:12.860 --> 00:53:14.830 align:middle line:84%
And all of them are
saying, we can't

00:53:14.830 --> 00:53:17.100 align:middle line:90%
go on watching this destruction.

00:53:17.100 --> 00:53:18.570 align:middle line:90%
We have to react to it.

00:53:18.570 --> 00:53:20.665 align:middle line:84%
And we have to react
to it from divine love,

00:53:20.665 --> 00:53:23.414 align:middle line:84%
from divine wisdom, from divine
peace, from divine passion.

00:53:23.414 --> 00:53:24.830 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Well,
along that line, I

00:53:24.830 --> 00:53:27.210 align:middle line:84%
will do what I can to
reach many of the people

00:53:27.210 --> 00:53:29.800 align:middle line:84%
that you have deep respect for
and bring them to our audience

00:53:29.800 --> 00:53:30.299 align:middle line:90%
as well.

00:53:30.299 --> 00:53:32.320 align:middle line:84%
>>HARVEY: You are
doing a fabulous job.

00:53:32.320 --> 00:53:36.170 align:middle line:84%
And what you're doing is
sacred activism, so thank you.

00:53:36.170 --> 00:53:39.100 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Thank you,
Andrew, once again.

00:53:39.100 --> 00:53:41.810 align:middle line:84%
As always, Andrew is one of
the most inspiring voices

00:53:41.810 --> 00:53:42.310 align:middle line:90%
out there.

00:53:42.310 --> 00:53:45.050 align:middle line:10%
You can follow up in the ways
that he's just suggested,

00:53:45.050 --> 00:53:47.055 align:middle line:10%
and you can also go deeper
into his life's work

00:53:47.055 --> 00:53:48.680 align:middle line:10%
through one of his
many, many brilliant

00:53:48.680 --> 00:53:50.770 align:middle line:10%
and inspirational
books, especially

00:53:50.770 --> 00:53:53.430 align:middle line:10%
"The Hope: A Guide
to Sacred Activism."

00:53:53.430 --> 00:53:55.750 align:middle line:10%
You can also learn more
about Andrew's Institute

00:53:55.750 --> 00:53:57.940 align:middle line:10%
for Sacred Activism and
how to become involved

00:53:57.940 --> 00:54:00.810 align:middle line:10%
through his website,
AndrewHarvey.net.

00:54:00.810 --> 00:54:04.480 align:middle line:10%
Until next time, thank you for
