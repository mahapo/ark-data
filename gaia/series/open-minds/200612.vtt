00:00:09.462 --> 00:00:16.434 align:middle line:90%
[INTRO MUSIC]

00:00:16.434 --> 00:00:19.920 align:middle line:90%


00:00:19.920 --> 00:00:23.020 align:middle line:10%
>>REGINA MEREDITH: Cynthia Sue
Larson is back with us to charm

00:00:23.020 --> 00:00:25.270 align:middle line:10%
us with stories of
parallel realities,

00:00:25.270 --> 00:00:27.340 align:middle line:10%
the Mandela effect,
which is among the most

00:00:27.340 --> 00:00:30.100 align:middle line:10%
fascinating topics in the
world for me personally.

00:00:30.100 --> 00:00:33.280 align:middle line:84%
Just as titillating is
Cynthia's own life story.

00:00:33.280 --> 00:00:34.840 align:middle line:84%
After we finish
being dazzled, we're

00:00:34.840 --> 00:00:38.080 align:middle line:84%
going to look at the mechanics
of what is actually occurring

00:00:38.080 --> 00:00:39.760 align:middle line:90%
in the Mandela effect.

00:00:39.760 --> 00:00:42.057 align:middle line:84%
Thank you so much for
coming back, Cynthia.

00:00:42.057 --> 00:00:44.140 align:middle line:84%
I just can't get enough
of this because I'm trying

00:00:44.140 --> 00:00:46.690 align:middle line:90%
to get my mind around it.

00:00:46.690 --> 00:00:49.537 align:middle line:84%
To me, I have to see how
it mechanically works.

00:00:49.537 --> 00:00:50.620 align:middle line:90%
>>CYNTHIA SUE LARSON: Yes.

00:00:50.620 --> 00:00:52.328 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: You know,
it has to make sense.

00:00:52.328 --> 00:00:53.830 align:middle line:84%
It doesn't matter
if it's quantum.

00:00:53.830 --> 00:00:55.570 align:middle line:84%
You can still see it
in your mind's eye

00:00:55.570 --> 00:00:56.680 align:middle line:90%
if you can understand it.

00:00:56.680 --> 00:00:57.280 align:middle line:90%
>>LARSON: Right.

00:00:57.280 --> 00:00:57.630 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right?

00:00:57.630 --> 00:00:58.210 align:middle line:90%
>>LARSON: Exactly.

00:00:58.210 --> 00:00:59.010 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: OK.

00:00:59.010 --> 00:01:03.460 align:middle line:84%
So first of all, we
didn't do this before.

00:01:03.460 --> 00:01:05.440 align:middle line:84%
I want to go into your
childhood a little bit

00:01:05.440 --> 00:01:07.020 align:middle line:90%
because we know you--

00:01:07.020 --> 00:01:10.870 align:middle line:84%
Berkeley, loads of
letters after your name,

00:01:10.870 --> 00:01:15.400 align:middle line:84%
amazing human being academically
who has, for the last 20 years,

00:01:15.400 --> 00:01:18.520 align:middle line:84%
involved yourself in the
study of parallel realities

00:01:18.520 --> 00:01:19.830 align:middle line:90%
or the Mandela effect, right?

00:01:19.830 --> 00:01:20.630 align:middle line:90%
>>LARSON: Right.

00:01:20.630 --> 00:01:22.900 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So a
different kind of person

00:01:22.900 --> 00:01:27.970 align:middle line:84%
would do that than your
normal graduate, right?

00:01:27.970 --> 00:01:28.870 align:middle line:90%
>>LARSON: Right.

00:01:28.870 --> 00:01:31.120 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: With high
degrees from Berkeley.

00:01:31.120 --> 00:01:34.472 align:middle line:84%
So let's go back to when you
were a little kid because I

00:01:34.472 --> 00:01:36.430 align:middle line:84%
was watching one of your
pieces, and I thought,

00:01:36.430 --> 00:01:38.415 align:middle line:84%
I didn't really
know this about you.

00:01:38.415 --> 00:01:39.790 align:middle line:84%
I didn't know any
of the details,

00:01:39.790 --> 00:01:41.410 align:middle line:90%
just that you were different.

00:01:41.410 --> 00:01:43.090 align:middle line:90%
But this one really got me.

00:01:43.090 --> 00:01:46.360 align:middle line:84%
When you were 5 years old,
you envisioned reality

00:01:46.360 --> 00:01:48.820 align:middle line:84%
as kind of a web
of consciousness.

00:01:48.820 --> 00:01:50.890 align:middle line:84%
That's not a normal
five-year-old perception

00:01:50.890 --> 00:01:51.835 align:middle line:90%
of life.

00:01:51.835 --> 00:01:52.660 align:middle line:90%
>>LARSON: Right.

00:01:52.660 --> 00:01:55.090 align:middle line:10%
This is much deeper
It comes from,

00:01:55.090 --> 00:01:57.340 align:middle line:10%
I guess you could call it
an awareness of who I am

00:01:57.340 --> 00:01:59.440 align:middle line:10%
intrinsically that was with me.

00:01:59.440 --> 00:02:01.970 align:middle line:10%
I didn't lose it when
I came into this life.

00:02:01.970 --> 00:02:03.460 align:middle line:10%
So you're right.

00:02:03.460 --> 00:02:06.070 align:middle line:10%
It absolutely makes me
different from most people,

00:02:06.070 --> 00:02:08.830 align:middle line:10%
just seeing that we are so
interconnected, that this

00:02:08.830 --> 00:02:14.230 align:middle line:10%
is tied in with my purpose,
my passion for being part

00:02:14.230 --> 00:02:17.740 align:middle line:10%
of uplifting this
web of consciousness

00:02:17.740 --> 00:02:20.650 align:middle line:10%
because it came-- this
vision came to me just

00:02:20.650 --> 00:02:21.520 align:middle line:10%
like a knowingness.

00:02:21.520 --> 00:02:24.250 align:middle line:84%
Like, this is what
I'm here to do.

00:02:24.250 --> 00:02:26.080 align:middle line:90%
Remember, I have a purpose here.

00:02:26.080 --> 00:02:29.165 align:middle line:84%
Because I was having some
doubts about why I was here.

00:02:29.165 --> 00:02:29.965 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: At 5?

00:02:29.965 --> 00:02:30.565 align:middle line:90%
>>LARSON: Yes.

00:02:30.565 --> 00:02:32.482 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: I was just
trying to score cupcakes.

00:02:32.482 --> 00:02:35.152 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHTER]

00:02:35.152 --> 00:02:36.460 align:middle line:90%
>>LARSON: Oh, my gosh.

00:02:36.460 --> 00:02:38.373 align:middle line:84%
I felt like I was
noticing people would--

00:02:38.373 --> 00:02:39.790 align:middle line:84%
they'd have one
thing that they're

00:02:39.790 --> 00:02:42.580 align:middle line:84%
saying, that they're
expressing with their minds

00:02:42.580 --> 00:02:44.590 align:middle line:84%
and their voice, they'd
have something else

00:02:44.590 --> 00:02:46.810 align:middle line:84%
in their heart, and
then yet something else

00:02:46.810 --> 00:02:48.325 align:middle line:90%
going on in their subconscious.

00:02:48.325 --> 00:02:50.260 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And you could
see all those level?

00:02:50.260 --> 00:02:51.670 align:middle line:90%
>>LARSON: Yes, I could feel it.

00:02:51.670 --> 00:02:53.045 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: The
duplicitous nature.

00:02:53.045 --> 00:02:56.260 align:middle line:84%
>>LARSON: It felt very
jarring, very jagged energy--

00:02:56.260 --> 00:02:58.030 align:middle line:84%
not everybody, but
a lot of people.

00:02:58.030 --> 00:02:59.380 align:middle line:90%
It was the norm.

00:02:59.380 --> 00:03:02.230 align:middle line:84%
Everywhere I looked, that
was considered normal.

00:03:02.230 --> 00:03:06.760 align:middle line:84%
So I felt like I remembered
the peace, the love, the joy,

00:03:06.760 --> 00:03:09.560 align:middle line:90%
the reverence before I was born.

00:03:09.560 --> 00:03:11.560 align:middle line:84%
And because I
remembered that, it

00:03:11.560 --> 00:03:14.450 align:middle line:84%
made me what you might
call sort of a flight risk.

00:03:14.450 --> 00:03:16.685 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHTER]

00:03:16.685 --> 00:03:18.060 align:middle line:84%
Like, I remember
how good it was.

00:03:18.060 --> 00:03:20.140 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Do you remember
your birth itself--

00:03:20.140 --> 00:03:20.920 align:middle line:90%
>>LARSON: Not clearly, no.

00:03:20.920 --> 00:03:23.410 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: --and whether you
had any-- or even right after,

00:03:23.410 --> 00:03:25.240 align:middle line:84%
whether you had some
second thoughts?

00:03:25.240 --> 00:03:27.628 align:middle line:84%
>>LARSON: No, it's
not so much that.

00:03:27.628 --> 00:03:29.170 align:middle line:84%
I think I don't
really remember that.

00:03:29.170 --> 00:03:30.730 align:middle line:84%
And I just remember
good feelings.

00:03:30.730 --> 00:03:31.790 align:middle line:90%
I had a good family.

00:03:31.790 --> 00:03:33.790 align:middle line:84%
So I'm not saying anything
bad about my parents.

00:03:33.790 --> 00:03:35.253 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: No, just
life, on Earth.

00:03:35.253 --> 00:03:36.670 align:middle line:84%
>>LARSON: It's
just life on Earth.

00:03:36.670 --> 00:03:39.760 align:middle line:84%
That was a traumatic
feeling for me.

00:03:39.760 --> 00:03:42.550 align:middle line:84%
It took me many years
to feel like, well, I

00:03:42.550 --> 00:03:44.110 align:middle line:90%
don't have to stay here.

00:03:44.110 --> 00:03:46.210 align:middle line:84%
I could go back to
that feeling of heaven,

00:03:46.210 --> 00:03:47.920 align:middle line:84%
that feeling of
paradise where we all

00:03:47.920 --> 00:03:49.460 align:middle line:90%
know that we're connected.

00:03:49.460 --> 00:03:50.980 align:middle line:90%
We remember it.

00:03:50.980 --> 00:03:52.605 align:middle line:84%
We remember how much
we love everybody.

00:03:52.605 --> 00:03:53.405 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:03:53.405 --> 00:03:55.060 align:middle line:84%
>>LARSON: How much
we love everything.

00:03:55.060 --> 00:03:55.750 align:middle line:90%
And so--

00:03:55.750 --> 00:03:56.590 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: That's our
essence, our core.

00:03:56.590 --> 00:03:57.757 align:middle line:90%
>>LARSON: It is our essence.

00:03:57.757 --> 00:04:00.430 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And you just came
in living your essence,

00:04:00.430 --> 00:04:03.660 align:middle line:84%
and remembering your essence,
and not separating out from it.

00:04:03.660 --> 00:04:04.460 align:middle line:90%
>>LARSON: Yes.

00:04:04.460 --> 00:04:07.010 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And that's called
being born awake, basically?

00:04:07.010 --> 00:04:07.810 align:middle line:90%
>>LARSON: Right.

00:04:07.810 --> 00:04:10.143 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: I mean, that's very
different than what people

00:04:10.143 --> 00:04:12.328 align:middle line:84%
call being "woke,"
which is political,

00:04:12.328 --> 00:04:13.245 align:middle line:90%
political correctness.

00:04:13.245 --> 00:04:13.780 align:middle line:84%
>>LARSON: [LAUGHS] No,
that's very different.

00:04:13.780 --> 00:04:15.100 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: That has nothing
to do with being awake.

00:04:15.100 --> 00:04:15.900 align:middle line:90%
>>LARSON: No.

00:04:15.900 --> 00:04:18.649 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah, and I love this.

00:04:18.649 --> 00:04:21.130 align:middle line:84%
OK, so I have a couple of
things written down now.

00:04:21.130 --> 00:04:22.480 align:middle line:90%
One of the things--

00:04:22.480 --> 00:04:25.468 align:middle line:84%
before all the Kundalini
awakenings and all that sort

00:04:25.468 --> 00:04:27.010 align:middle line:84%
of thing, when you
were a little kid,

00:04:27.010 --> 00:04:31.030 align:middle line:84%
you would you would look out
the window at the rain, right?

00:04:31.030 --> 00:04:32.955 align:middle line:84%
And you'd just play
with your thoughts,

00:04:32.955 --> 00:04:34.330 align:middle line:84%
and the rain would
play with you?

00:04:34.330 --> 00:04:38.530 align:middle line:84%
>>LARSON: Right, so I
could, think "stop rain,"

00:04:38.530 --> 00:04:40.210 align:middle line:90%
and it would instantly stop.

00:04:40.210 --> 00:04:43.282 align:middle line:84%
And think "start rain,"
and it would start.

00:04:43.282 --> 00:04:44.740 align:middle line:84%
I was just playing
with it like you

00:04:44.740 --> 00:04:46.570 align:middle line:90%
play with your blocks or a toy.

00:04:46.570 --> 00:04:48.560 align:middle line:84%
And I thought, this
is so much fun.

00:04:48.560 --> 00:04:50.320 align:middle line:84%
And I wanted to
share it with my mom,

00:04:50.320 --> 00:04:52.470 align:middle line:84%
like when you built
a tower of blocks.

00:04:52.470 --> 00:04:53.920 align:middle line:90%
Like, hey, look at this.

00:04:53.920 --> 00:04:57.550 align:middle line:84%
So I ran to where
she was, and I could

00:04:57.550 --> 00:05:01.150 align:middle line:84%
see, as I started to
explain what I had in mind,

00:05:01.150 --> 00:05:03.010 align:middle line:90%
sort of a shut down reaction.

00:05:03.010 --> 00:05:04.950 align:middle line:90%
Like, oh, dear.

00:05:04.950 --> 00:05:07.640 align:middle line:84%
But it's a typical reaction
when a child says, watch this,

00:05:07.640 --> 00:05:08.890 align:middle line:90%
I can start and stop the rain.

00:05:08.890 --> 00:05:11.320 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Were you able to
stop and start it for her?

00:05:11.320 --> 00:05:13.030 align:middle line:90%
>>LARSON: No, not with her.

00:05:13.030 --> 00:05:15.310 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Because
of the negativity?

00:05:15.310 --> 00:05:16.768 align:middle line:84%
Not negativity,
the lack of belief?

00:05:16.768 --> 00:05:17.568 align:middle line:90%
>>LARSON: Yes.

00:05:17.568 --> 00:05:18.410 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:05:18.410 --> 00:05:19.210 align:middle line:90%
>>LARSON: Exactly.

00:05:19.210 --> 00:05:21.130 align:middle line:84%
And at that point,
I was just a child,

00:05:21.130 --> 00:05:22.660 align:middle line:90%
and I didn't understand any of--

00:05:22.660 --> 00:05:25.840 align:middle line:84%
was an awareness of
it matters who you're

00:05:25.840 --> 00:05:27.040 align:middle line:90%
sharing these things with.

00:05:27.040 --> 00:05:30.430 align:middle line:84%
So then I recognized, let's
not mention the other things

00:05:30.430 --> 00:05:32.230 align:middle line:90%
I'm seeing energy wise.

00:05:32.230 --> 00:05:33.700 align:middle line:84%
I would bring them
up occasionally,

00:05:33.700 --> 00:05:36.130 align:middle line:84%
especially to my mom,
who was the most open,

00:05:36.130 --> 00:05:38.170 align:middle line:84%
besides my grandmother
in my family;

00:05:38.170 --> 00:05:41.590 align:middle line:84%
but otherwise, I realized
these topics are not

00:05:41.590 --> 00:05:42.862 align:middle line:90%
for polite society.

00:05:42.862 --> 00:05:44.320 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: What kind
of other things

00:05:44.320 --> 00:05:45.910 align:middle line:84%
were you seeing
as an only child?

00:05:45.910 --> 00:05:47.410 align:middle line:84%
>>LARSON: Oh, dark,
scuttily things.

00:05:47.410 --> 00:05:51.280 align:middle line:84%
Because I grew up in a house
that was not spiritual per se.

My dad was an atheist.

My mom was an agnostic.

00:05:54.250 --> 00:05:56.980 align:middle line:84%
And so I would have nightmares
around these scutilly things.

00:05:56.980 --> 00:05:59.260 align:middle line:84%
When I would fall asleep,
they'd try to pull me--

00:05:59.260 --> 00:06:01.480 align:middle line:84%
I'd start flying, and
they'd try to pull me down.

a good question.

that you don't
want in your house.

00:06:12.310 --> 00:06:13.840 align:middle line:84%
So when you do
energy clearing, it's

00:06:13.840 --> 00:06:15.970 align:middle line:84%
like vacuuming and

00:06:15.970 --> 00:06:17.265 align:middle line:90%
want to do that for your house.

00:06:17.265 --> 00:06:18.640 align:middle line:84%
You want to keep
your home clear.

do that quite a bit?

something super simple--

00:06:43.750 --> 00:06:48.020 align:middle line:84%
I take a glass of tap water and
just a little teaspoon of salt,

00:06:48.020 --> 00:06:50.170 align:middle line:84%
and then just change it
every couple of days.

>>LARSON: Yep, it's like a
crystal and attractor for all

00:07:02.980 --> 00:07:04.870 align:middle line:84%
that stuff, and just
dump it down the drain,

00:07:04.870 --> 00:07:07.330 align:middle line:90%
replace it every couple days.

00:07:07.330 --> 00:07:08.390 align:middle line:90%

can the entities not

00:07:10.182 --> 00:07:12.613 align:middle line:90%

kind of get your bearings

track with whatever

00:07:20.170 --> 00:07:20.740 align:middle line:90%

00:07:20.740 --> 00:07:22.115 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Interesting,
because we

00:07:22.115 --> 00:07:24.560 align:middle line:84%
know that salt is cleansing,
even in the human body.

OK, so did you ever
play with the rain,

00:07:27.710 --> 00:07:29.710 align:middle line:84%
for example, to the extent
it's like, you wanted

00:07:29.710 --> 00:07:31.120 align:middle line:84%
to go out and do
something, it was raining,

00:07:31.120 --> 00:07:32.890 align:middle line:84%
did you ever make it
stop for your own use

00:07:32.890 --> 00:07:34.700 align:middle line:84%
or just were you
only playing with it?

00:07:34.700 --> 00:07:36.783 align:middle line:84%
>>LARSON: I pretty much
only played with it, yeah.

00:07:36.783 --> 00:07:38.350 align:middle line:84%
Because I actually
think that there's

00:07:38.350 --> 00:07:42.310 align:middle line:84%
some bigger picture than
what I think might be best.

00:07:42.310 --> 00:07:45.100 align:middle line:84%
That's why I like to ask, how
good can it get for all of us,

00:07:45.100 --> 00:07:47.110 align:middle line:90%
for the best for all concerned?

00:07:47.110 --> 00:07:49.360 align:middle line:84%
I know that if I
focus on myself,

00:07:49.360 --> 00:07:51.333 align:middle line:84%
that's going to be
very short-sighted.

00:07:51.333 --> 00:07:52.750 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So you
know that there's

00:07:52.750 --> 00:07:54.670 align:middle line:84%
a purpose there for the

00:07:54.670 --> 00:07:55.540 align:middle line:90%
as a little girl.

Don't try to stop it.

00:07:56.570 --> 00:07:57.060 align:middle line:90%
It's supposed to be there.

00:07:57.060 --> 00:07:58.090 align:middle line:90%
>>LARSON: Right, right, right.

00:07:58.090 --> 00:07:58.450 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:07:58.450 --> 00:07:59.992 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: The only
thing you would do

00:07:59.992 --> 00:08:04.540 align:middle line:84%
is help, quote, "jump start"
is your family's old Chevy

00:08:04.540 --> 00:08:06.555 align:middle line:84%
or a television that
had gone on the fritz.

00:08:06.555 --> 00:08:08.180 align:middle line:84%
Let's talk about that
for a little bit.

00:08:08.180 --> 00:08:08.980 align:middle line:90%
>>LARSON: Right.

00:08:08.980 --> 00:08:11.530 align:middle line:84%
So this is now, I was keeping
things kind of under wraps

00:08:11.530 --> 00:08:15.490 align:middle line:84%
to myself, but I noticed that
I could feel love for something

00:08:15.490 --> 00:08:16.840 align:middle line:90%
like our car.

00:08:16.840 --> 00:08:19.660 align:middle line:90%
And my dad, who was an atheist--

00:08:19.660 --> 00:08:21.760 align:middle line:84%
he's an engineer,
civil engineer.

00:08:21.760 --> 00:08:24.420 align:middle line:84%
So he's thinking very left
brain, very analytical,

00:08:24.420 --> 00:08:25.670 align:middle line:90%
the starter's not working.

00:08:25.670 --> 00:08:28.000 align:middle line:84%
And then, he'd start
doing what dads do,

00:08:28.000 --> 00:08:31.480 align:middle line:84%
and getting a little grumbling,
and saying things that maybe

00:08:31.480 --> 00:08:33.567 align:middle line:90%
should be better not said.

00:08:33.567 --> 00:08:35.650 align:middle line:84%
When it starts getting
that, then I would realize,

00:08:35.650 --> 00:08:37.809 align:middle line:84%
I can just feel my
love for this car,

00:08:37.809 --> 00:08:40.059 align:middle line:84%
and I can hear the
sound of it starting

00:08:40.059 --> 00:08:42.490 align:middle line:90%
and feel the purr of the engine.

00:08:42.490 --> 00:08:44.710 align:middle line:84%
And so I'd just
feel, in alignment, I

00:08:44.710 --> 00:08:48.940 align:middle line:84%
could do this just, that state
of pureness of intention,

00:08:48.940 --> 00:08:52.235 align:middle line:84%
heart, just all of
me intending this.

00:08:52.235 --> 00:08:53.035 align:middle line:90%
And it would start.

00:08:53.035 --> 00:08:55.590 align:middle line:90%


00:08:55.590 --> 00:08:57.740 align:middle line:84%
And then, once it started
working so smoothly,

00:08:57.740 --> 00:09:00.778 align:middle line:90%
I would do this regularly.

00:09:00.778 --> 00:09:02.320 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: I mean,
it's just so sweet.

00:09:02.320 --> 00:09:04.750 align:middle line:84%
Because it was your actual
innocence, and sweetness,

00:09:04.750 --> 00:09:09.230 align:middle line:84%
and goodness of heart that was
permeating the material world.

00:09:09.230 --> 00:09:10.030 align:middle line:90%
>>LARSON: Right.

00:09:10.030 --> 00:09:11.680 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Now
what's that tell us?

00:09:11.680 --> 00:09:12.520 align:middle line:90%
It was love.

00:09:12.520 --> 00:09:15.820 align:middle line:84%
You just simply
permeated the field

00:09:15.820 --> 00:09:18.700 align:middle line:84%
with love that
changed the material

00:09:18.700 --> 00:09:22.000 align:middle line:90%
conditions of whatever it was.

00:09:22.000 --> 00:09:23.440 align:middle line:90%
>>LARSON: Absolutely, yes.

00:09:23.440 --> 00:09:25.600 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So what's
the big message there?

00:09:25.600 --> 00:09:26.830 align:middle line:90%
That's the big reveal.

00:09:26.830 --> 00:09:27.800 align:middle line:90%
>>LARSON: It's huge.

00:09:27.800 --> 00:09:28.600 align:middle line:90%
It is.

00:09:28.600 --> 00:09:30.308 align:middle line:84%
Because I think a lot
of us get caught up

00:09:30.308 --> 00:09:31.720 align:middle line:90%
in what it seems like it is.

00:09:31.720 --> 00:09:35.100 align:middle line:84%
The situation may seem
bad, like this car,

00:09:35.100 --> 00:09:36.610 align:middle line:84%
the starter's going
out, we should

00:09:36.610 --> 00:09:39.640 align:middle line:84%
get it replaced, or
we're stuck, or whatever

00:09:39.640 --> 00:09:44.000 align:middle line:84%
these thought patterns might be,
but we don't need to go there.

00:09:44.000 --> 00:09:47.140 align:middle line:84%
But it does require that
perfect alignment for someone

00:09:47.140 --> 00:09:49.585 align:middle line:90%
to be able to pull this off.

00:09:49.585 --> 00:09:50.423 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: It does.

00:09:50.423 --> 00:09:52.090 align:middle line:84%
And that's a hard one
because that means

00:09:52.090 --> 00:09:55.030 align:middle line:90%
letting go of belief systems.

00:09:55.030 --> 00:09:59.180 align:middle line:84%
The material world around us,
our scientific materialism,

00:09:59.180 --> 00:10:01.528 align:middle line:84%
you have to kind
of let go of that.

00:10:01.528 --> 00:10:03.070 align:middle line:84%
And you know, I had
a mentor in life,

00:10:03.070 --> 00:10:07.420 align:middle line:84%
Madame Bovie, wild Russian woman
who beat it at the revolution

00:10:07.420 --> 00:10:10.690 align:middle line:84%
on foot-- got to France,
became a ballerina.

00:10:10.690 --> 00:10:13.120 align:middle line:84%
When she was elderly, she
was my ballet teacher.

00:10:13.120 --> 00:10:14.530 align:middle line:90%
And we became very close.

00:10:14.530 --> 00:10:17.440 align:middle line:84%
And she had this
old, old Oldsmobile--

00:10:17.440 --> 00:10:18.600 align:middle line:90%
I mean old.

00:10:18.600 --> 00:10:21.010 align:middle line:90%
And that's what she did.

00:10:21.010 --> 00:10:22.307 align:middle line:90%
She loved her car so much her.

00:10:22.307 --> 00:10:24.390 align:middle line:84%
Her car was named "Pandora"
because she was always

00:10:24.390 --> 00:10:26.630 align:middle line:90%
full of surprises.

00:10:26.630 --> 00:10:29.390 align:middle line:84%
And she would say,
baby, come on, Pandora.

00:10:29.390 --> 00:10:31.620 align:middle line:90%
You must start from me today.

00:10:31.620 --> 00:10:34.700 align:middle line:84%
And she would just
pad it, and love it,

00:10:34.700 --> 00:10:38.588 align:middle line:84%
then she'd turnover when she
hadn't turned over previously.

00:10:38.588 --> 00:10:39.880 align:middle line:90%
So I used to watch her do that.

00:10:39.880 --> 00:10:43.080 align:middle line:84%
So when I was watching
the film about you,

00:10:43.080 --> 00:10:45.640 align:middle line:84%
I mean, I've had some experience
with one other person.

00:10:45.640 --> 00:10:50.510 align:middle line:84%
It's very, very
rare that we can let

00:10:50.510 --> 00:10:54.320 align:middle line:84%
go of everything that we
have learned to be "true"

00:10:54.320 --> 00:10:55.520 align:middle line:90%
on the material realm.

00:10:55.520 --> 00:10:57.800 align:middle line:84%
>>LARSON: I think it helps that
I came in with that awareness,

00:10:57.800 --> 00:10:58.520 align:middle line:90%
that I am consciousness.

00:10:58.520 --> 00:10:59.010 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Absolutely.

00:10:59.010 --> 00:11:00.718 align:middle line:84%
>>LARSON: Like, I had
a jump start there.

00:11:00.718 --> 00:11:02.760 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Oh, yeah, I
think you absolutely did.

00:11:02.760 --> 00:11:04.760 align:middle line:84%
And it was interesting
as you went through life,

00:11:04.760 --> 00:11:06.170 align:middle line:84%
you ended up
getting your degrees

00:11:06.170 --> 00:11:10.910 align:middle line:84%
in physics, which is the perfect
way station for someone who

00:11:10.910 --> 00:11:13.700 align:middle line:84%
wants to jump between the
material and non-material

00:11:13.700 --> 00:11:15.380 align:middle line:90%
in an academic sense, right?

00:11:15.380 --> 00:11:17.970 align:middle line:84%
>>LARSON: Yes, it's
perfect, absolutely perfect.

00:11:17.970 --> 00:11:20.180 align:middle line:84%
And I wanted to
study consciousness,

00:11:20.180 --> 00:11:23.760 align:middle line:84%
but there was no program in
that at UC Berkeley at the time.

00:11:23.760 --> 00:11:25.700 align:middle line:84%
So I took as many
psychology classes

00:11:25.700 --> 00:11:28.065 align:middle line:84%
as I could, and then, of
course, quantum physics

00:11:28.065 --> 00:11:28.865 align:middle line:90%
was my favorite.

00:11:28.865 --> 00:11:29.840 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right, right.

00:11:29.840 --> 00:11:32.310 align:middle line:84%
Absolutely, because that's
where all this stuff plays out.

00:11:32.310 --> 00:11:34.440 align:middle line:84%
So let's go back to
your childhood a bit.

00:11:34.440 --> 00:11:36.350 align:middle line:84%
Your parents, you
traveled quite a bit?

00:11:36.350 --> 00:11:37.150 align:middle line:90%
>>LARSON: Yes.

00:11:37.150 --> 00:11:39.840 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Family traveled they
traveled to exotic places.

00:11:39.840 --> 00:11:40.910 align:middle line:90%
There was a headboard.

00:11:40.910 --> 00:11:43.160 align:middle line:84%
Was it a headboard or piece
of furniture of some kind?

00:11:43.160 --> 00:11:44.120 align:middle line:90%
>>LARSON: Yeah, coffee tables.

00:11:44.120 --> 00:11:45.530 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Coffee table
that they were kind of--

00:11:45.530 --> 00:11:46.205 align:middle line:90%
>>LARSON: And a writing desk.

00:11:46.205 --> 00:11:47.500 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes, OK.

00:11:47.500 --> 00:11:50.030 align:middle line:84%
And so you remembered
that they made

00:11:50.030 --> 00:11:53.400 align:middle line:84%
a deal with the person that
had made it for them, right?

00:11:53.400 --> 00:11:54.200 align:middle line:90%
>>LARSON: Right.

00:11:54.200 --> 00:11:55.908 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: They were
gonna send a picture.

00:11:55.908 --> 00:11:57.380 align:middle line:90%
>>LARSON: Yes, I was there.

00:11:57.380 --> 00:11:58.713 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Let's talk about this.

00:11:58.713 --> 00:12:01.908 align:middle line:84%
Was this your first real
kind of awareness of, even

00:12:01.908 --> 00:12:04.450 align:middle line:84%
if you didn't know what it was,
but experience of the Mandela

00:12:04.450 --> 00:12:05.915 align:middle line:90%
effect?

00:12:05.915 --> 00:12:08.540 align:middle line:84%
>>LARSON: I think that probably
was the first one where I could

00:12:08.540 --> 00:12:12.680 align:middle line:84%
see that consciousness was
changing in groups of people,

00:12:12.680 --> 00:12:15.342 align:middle line:84%
that the physical
history of events--

00:12:15.342 --> 00:12:16.800 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So tell
us what happened.

00:12:16.800 --> 00:12:21.308 align:middle line:84%
>>LARSON: So what happened is,
we were traveling to Kashmir,

00:12:21.308 --> 00:12:22.850 align:middle line:84%
and there was a
place that we stayed,

00:12:22.850 --> 00:12:25.430 align:middle line:84%
a very beautiful
place called Dal Lake.

00:12:25.430 --> 00:12:26.960 align:middle line:90%
And there were houseboats.

00:12:26.960 --> 00:12:28.580 align:middle line:90%
We rented one.

00:12:28.580 --> 00:12:31.610 align:middle line:84%
We were staying and visiting
the various craftsmen

00:12:31.610 --> 00:12:35.360 align:middle line:84%
that are there with beautiful
wood carvings, carpets,

00:12:35.360 --> 00:12:38.330 align:middle line:84%
that kind of thing, where
they hand stitch everything.

00:12:38.330 --> 00:12:40.820 align:middle line:84%
But for the furniture that my
parents wanted to bring back

00:12:40.820 --> 00:12:43.410 align:middle line:84%
to the house that
we were building,

00:12:43.410 --> 00:12:45.500 align:middle line:84%
it would have to be
shipped in pieces.

00:12:45.500 --> 00:12:47.150 align:middle line:90%
And so it would take a while.

00:12:47.150 --> 00:12:49.580 align:middle line:84%
It was going to take
maybe weeks, months for it

00:12:49.580 --> 00:12:52.190 align:middle line:84%
to get back to
the United States.

00:12:52.190 --> 00:12:54.830 align:middle line:84%
I heard my parents
telling the wood carvers,

00:12:54.830 --> 00:12:56.300 align:middle line:84%
this is such
beautiful furniture.

00:12:56.300 --> 00:12:58.735 align:middle line:84%
We're building a new
house designed around it.

00:12:58.735 --> 00:13:00.110 align:middle line:84%
And the wood
carvers were amazed.

00:13:00.110 --> 00:13:00.910 align:middle line:90%
Really?

00:13:00.910 --> 00:13:02.480 align:middle line:90%
Designed around our furniture?

00:13:02.480 --> 00:13:04.640 align:middle line:84%
They said, yes, because
we're designing it now,

00:13:04.640 --> 00:13:06.200 align:middle line:90%
so it's going to be perfect.

00:13:06.200 --> 00:13:08.720 align:middle line:84%
And I remember my
parents said, we

00:13:08.720 --> 00:13:11.268 align:middle line:84%
will take pictures
and send them to you.

00:13:11.268 --> 00:13:12.560 align:middle line:90%
And so this took quite a while.

00:13:12.560 --> 00:13:14.060 align:middle line:84%
The whole construction
of the house,

00:13:14.060 --> 00:13:16.160 align:middle line:84%
the shipment of
furniture, putting it in.

00:13:16.160 --> 00:13:19.310 align:middle line:84%
And quite a while later,
there it is in place.

00:13:19.310 --> 00:13:21.383 align:middle line:84%
And I kept waiting
for the pictures.

00:13:21.383 --> 00:13:22.550 align:middle line:90%
I thought, this will be fun.

00:13:22.550 --> 00:13:23.967 align:middle line:84%
Are they going to
bring in lights?

00:13:23.967 --> 00:13:26.390 align:middle line:90%
And do we have a photographer?

00:13:26.390 --> 00:13:27.670 align:middle line:90%
Nothing was happening.

00:13:27.670 --> 00:13:29.900 align:middle line:84%
And at some point,
I asked my parents,

00:13:29.900 --> 00:13:31.267 align:middle line:90%
what about the photographs?

00:13:31.267 --> 00:13:32.600 align:middle line:90%
And they said, what photographs?

00:13:32.600 --> 00:13:33.650 align:middle line:90%
Of the furniture?

00:13:33.650 --> 00:13:36.230 align:middle line:84%
The coffee tables,
the writing desk

00:13:36.230 --> 00:13:39.290 align:middle line:84%
in the library that we built,
designed around these furniture

00:13:39.290 --> 00:13:40.340 align:middle line:90%
pieces?

00:13:40.340 --> 00:13:42.650 align:middle line:84%
What about sending them
to the wood carvers?

00:13:42.650 --> 00:13:44.480 align:middle line:90%
You promised that you'd do this.

00:13:44.480 --> 00:13:47.300 align:middle line:84%
And they said, we didn't
say anything like that.

00:13:47.300 --> 00:13:48.440 align:middle line:90%
And I believe my parents.

00:13:48.440 --> 00:13:49.820 align:middle line:84%
I believed that they
were telling the truth.

00:13:49.820 --> 00:13:50.630 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: They're rational.

00:13:50.630 --> 00:13:52.700 align:middle line:84%
>>LARSON: Yes, they would
not lie to me right.

00:13:52.700 --> 00:13:54.033 align:middle line:90%
I know they would not lie to me.

00:13:54.033 --> 00:13:57.350 align:middle line:84%
So then that was a very moment
of cognitive dissonance,

00:13:57.350 --> 00:13:59.210 align:middle line:90%
where they are correct.

00:13:59.210 --> 00:14:00.695 align:middle line:84%
They said, we never
promised that.

00:14:00.695 --> 00:14:01.820 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: But you heard it.

00:14:01.820 --> 00:14:03.112 align:middle line:90%
>>LARSON: But I heard it.

00:14:03.112 --> 00:14:04.820 align:middle line:84%
And where would that
idea have come from?

00:14:04.820 --> 00:14:07.610 align:middle line:84%
How could I have
gotten such an idea?

00:14:07.610 --> 00:14:09.320 align:middle line:90%
People don't normally do that.

00:14:09.320 --> 00:14:11.505 align:middle line:84%
I'm a child, a
teenager, but still.

00:14:11.505 --> 00:14:13.380 align:middle line:84%
Why would I come up with
something like that?

00:14:13.380 --> 00:14:16.490 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Well, so this
begins the disconcerting

00:14:16.490 --> 00:14:18.020 align:middle line:90%
part of your journey.

00:14:18.020 --> 00:14:20.990 align:middle line:90%
So then another thing--

00:14:20.990 --> 00:14:23.450 align:middle line:84%
I took notes because I wanted
to get to all these things--

00:14:23.450 --> 00:14:26.330 align:middle line:90%
1977, a radio song came on.

00:14:26.330 --> 00:14:30.725 align:middle line:84%
And they said, and,
basically, this is brand new,

00:14:30.725 --> 00:14:31.850 align:middle line:90%
playing for the first time.

00:14:31.850 --> 00:14:33.480 align:middle line:90%
>>LARSON: Right, brand-new song.

00:14:33.480 --> 00:14:35.420 align:middle line:90%
And I was so sick of that song.

00:14:35.420 --> 00:14:37.460 align:middle line:84%
I thought, oh my
gosh, not that song.

00:14:37.460 --> 00:14:39.170 align:middle line:84%
I wish I remembered
now what it was,

00:14:39.170 --> 00:14:41.165 align:middle line:84%
but I was so upset about
the whole experience.

00:14:41.165 --> 00:14:43.330 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Because you'd
heard it so many times.

00:14:43.330 --> 00:14:46.130 align:middle line:84%
>>LARSON: You know when you
get radio burnout on a song?

00:14:46.130 --> 00:14:47.690 align:middle line:90%
Like, not this again.

00:14:47.690 --> 00:14:49.890 align:middle line:84%
Could we please
stop playing this?

00:14:49.890 --> 00:14:51.672 align:middle line:90%
And why would they say that?

00:14:51.672 --> 00:14:52.880 align:middle line:90%
I just thought it was so odd.

00:14:52.880 --> 00:14:55.520 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Do you think that
it was a parallel timeline

00:14:55.520 --> 00:14:57.650 align:middle line:84%
or reality, or was
it that you might

00:14:57.650 --> 00:15:00.650 align:middle line:84%
have been actually hearing into
it while they were creating it,

00:15:00.650 --> 00:15:02.360 align:middle line:84%
you were hearing it
through the ethers?

00:15:02.360 --> 00:15:04.785 align:middle line:84%
>>LARSON: No, this is different,
because I do hear songs

00:15:04.785 --> 00:15:05.660 align:middle line:90%
before they come out.

00:15:05.660 --> 00:15:06.520 align:middle line:90%
That's a different experience.

00:15:06.520 --> 00:15:08.510 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: OK, so tell us
the difference in this.

00:15:08.510 --> 00:15:10.010 align:middle line:84%
>>LARSON: For me,
the difference is,

00:15:10.010 --> 00:15:12.350 align:middle line:84%
when I hear a song that's
kind of in the background,

00:15:12.350 --> 00:15:14.012 align:middle line:84%
then I start craving
actually-- it's

00:15:14.012 --> 00:15:16.470 align:middle line:84%
like when you're thinking about
a favorite food and a place

00:15:16.470 --> 00:15:18.903 align:middle line:84%
you travel to, and
you're craving it.

00:15:18.903 --> 00:15:19.820 align:middle line:90%
That's the difference.

00:15:19.820 --> 00:15:22.520 align:middle line:84%
And then when it finally
comes, like, yay,

00:15:22.520 --> 00:15:25.400 align:middle line:84%
whereas if you're actually
hearing it to the point,

00:15:25.400 --> 00:15:26.900 align:middle line:84%
like, oh, let's
change the channel--

00:15:26.900 --> 00:15:28.192 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah, I'm sick of it.

00:15:28.192 --> 00:15:30.770 align:middle line:84%
>>LARSON: I heard this too
much, talk about overplay.

00:15:30.770 --> 00:15:32.270 align:middle line:84%
And then they have
the nerve to say,

00:15:32.270 --> 00:15:33.980 align:middle line:84%
this is the first
time we're playing it.

00:15:33.980 --> 00:15:35.940 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Yeah,
the nerve of them.

00:15:35.940 --> 00:15:36.740 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:15:36.740 --> 00:15:39.410 align:middle line:84%
>>LARSON: And I ask my friends,
have you heard this, too?

00:15:39.410 --> 00:15:41.660 align:middle line:84%
And they didn't know
what I was talking about.

00:15:41.660 --> 00:15:42.620 align:middle line:90%
My sister didn't know.

00:15:42.620 --> 00:15:44.060 align:middle line:90%
My best friend didn't know.

00:15:44.060 --> 00:15:47.300 align:middle line:84%
So that was also interesting,
very similar to the furniture

00:15:47.300 --> 00:15:48.420 align:middle line:90%
experience.

00:15:48.420 --> 00:15:52.090 align:middle line:84%
So I'm experiencing a reality
that other people are not.

00:15:52.090 --> 00:15:53.800 align:middle line:84%
But I know that I'm
not making it up,

00:15:53.800 --> 00:15:56.230 align:middle line:84%
and I believe the
radio announcer

00:15:56.230 --> 00:15:58.360 align:middle line:84%
because they were so
thrilled, it's our first time

00:15:58.360 --> 00:16:00.280 align:middle line:90%
to play this wonderful song.

00:16:00.280 --> 00:16:01.130 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:16:01.130 --> 00:16:02.980 align:middle line:84%
I wish you remembered what
it was, too, but that's OK.

00:16:02.980 --> 00:16:03.855 align:middle line:90%
>>LARSON: I, do, too.

00:16:03.855 --> 00:16:04.760 align:middle line:90%
I was so annoyed.

00:16:04.760 --> 00:16:05.140 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:16:05.140 --> 00:16:07.090 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: OK, so, then,
shortly after that,

00:16:07.090 --> 00:16:09.840 align:middle line:84%
you met your future
self one day.

00:16:09.840 --> 00:16:12.028 align:middle line:90%
>>LARSON: Right, I did.

00:16:12.028 --> 00:16:14.320 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: A lot of people
would want to dial into this.

00:16:14.320 --> 00:16:17.740 align:middle line:84%
>>LARSON: Yeah, so it's kind of
an experience where time is not

00:16:17.740 --> 00:16:21.730 align:middle line:84%
linear, and you can see that
something else is going on.

00:16:21.730 --> 00:16:24.610 align:middle line:84%
I had been dozing off--
so I was in a sort

00:16:24.610 --> 00:16:28.360 align:middle line:84%
of a hypnagogic state, right
between waking and sleeping,

00:16:28.360 --> 00:16:30.880 align:middle line:84%
and I saw a woman who
looked just like me,

00:16:30.880 --> 00:16:34.000 align:middle line:84%
but older, maybe about the
age I am now walking, sort

00:16:34.000 --> 00:16:38.050 align:middle line:84%
of floating out of my mirror
closet doors that filled--

00:16:38.050 --> 00:16:39.520 align:middle line:90%
it was across a whole wall.

00:16:39.520 --> 00:16:41.740 align:middle line:84%
She sort of walked right
out of the mirrors,

00:16:41.740 --> 00:16:43.180 align:middle line:90%
sort of float-walked--

00:16:43.180 --> 00:16:46.870 align:middle line:84%
like she wasn't totally there,
thinking thoughts to me, like,

00:16:46.870 --> 00:16:47.860 align:middle line:90%
hello, I'm startled.

00:16:47.860 --> 00:16:49.180 align:middle line:90%
Like, what are you doing here?

00:16:49.180 --> 00:16:52.990 align:middle line:84%
And she sort of float-walked
over to my roll top desk.

00:16:52.990 --> 00:16:54.700 align:middle line:84%
And she's very
soothing saying, I'm

00:16:54.700 --> 00:16:58.630 align:middle line:84%
just here to talk with
you for a little bit.

00:16:58.630 --> 00:17:00.310 align:middle line:84%
I can't remember
exactly what she said,

00:17:00.310 --> 00:17:02.200 align:middle line:90%
but I'm talking out loud to her.

00:17:02.200 --> 00:17:03.580 align:middle line:90%
I'm about 16 years old.

00:17:03.580 --> 00:17:06.849 align:middle line:84%
And she pulls out the
drawer of my roll-top desk,

00:17:06.849 --> 00:17:10.918 align:middle line:84%
takes something, closes it,
and then she floats away.

00:17:10.918 --> 00:17:12.335 align:middle line:84%
The whole thing
was quite strange.

00:17:12.335 --> 00:17:13.480 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Do you
know what she took?

00:17:13.480 --> 00:17:15.220 align:middle line:84%
>>LARSON: I did the
next day because I

00:17:15.220 --> 00:17:17.650 align:middle line:84%
went to check that drawer,
like what was that.

00:17:17.650 --> 00:17:20.319 align:middle line:84%
And those were some
letters from my boyfriend

00:17:20.319 --> 00:17:21.819 align:middle line:90%
who'd written to me.

00:17:21.819 --> 00:17:22.990 align:middle line:90%
And they were gone.

00:17:22.990 --> 00:17:24.823 align:middle line:84%
But I thought, she
couldn't have taken them.

00:17:24.823 --> 00:17:26.030 align:middle line:90%
That's crazy.

00:17:26.030 --> 00:17:27.440 align:middle line:90%
And so I accused my sister.

00:17:27.440 --> 00:17:28.700 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Of course.

00:17:28.700 --> 00:17:29.660 align:middle line:90%
She's convenient.

00:17:29.660 --> 00:17:30.460 align:middle line:90%
Makes sense.

00:17:30.460 --> 00:17:32.080 align:middle line:84%
>>LARSON: Yeah,
it had to be her.

00:17:32.080 --> 00:17:34.510 align:middle line:84%
And she was indignant,
like, no, I did not do that.

00:17:34.510 --> 00:17:38.000 align:middle line:84%
So I thought, wow, maybe
that really happened.

00:17:38.000 --> 00:17:41.620 align:middle line:84%
And right after my future self
came, and got the letters,

00:17:41.620 --> 00:17:45.115 align:middle line:84%
and left, my father knocked
on the door and came in like,

00:17:45.115 --> 00:17:46.660 align:middle line:90%
is everything, OK?

00:17:46.660 --> 00:17:48.430 align:middle line:90%
I heard you talking.

00:17:48.430 --> 00:17:49.520 align:middle line:90%
Like, everything's fine.

00:17:49.520 --> 00:17:50.470 align:middle line:90%
And I didn't realize--

00:17:50.470 --> 00:17:52.780 align:middle line:84%
I mean, the whole
thing was so weird.

00:17:52.780 --> 00:17:54.070 align:middle line:90%
I didn't know what to say.

00:17:54.070 --> 00:17:55.630 align:middle line:84%
Like, something strange
just to happened, but how

00:17:55.630 --> 00:17:56.350 align:middle line:90%
do you explain that?

00:17:56.350 --> 00:17:58.330 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: How do you explain
it and why did she take letters

00:17:58.330 --> 00:17:59.163 align:middle line:90%
from your boyfriend?

00:17:59.163 --> 00:18:00.340 align:middle line:90%
>>LARSON: I don't know.

00:18:00.340 --> 00:18:01.952 align:middle line:84%
Maybe to show that
time is not linear.

00:18:01.952 --> 00:18:03.910 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: That she could
reintroduce them later

00:18:03.910 --> 00:18:04.360 align:middle line:90%
or something?

00:18:04.360 --> 00:18:05.410 align:middle line:90%
>>LARSON: Yeah, maybe so.

00:18:05.410 --> 00:18:06.993 align:middle line:84%
I still haven't seen
them, but I still

00:18:06.993 --> 00:18:09.500 align:middle line:84%
saved the piece of furniture
at the roll-top desk.

00:18:09.500 --> 00:18:13.330 align:middle line:84%
So if the letters do show
up, that'll be interesting.

00:18:13.330 --> 00:18:15.970 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: OK, before we go
on, because I want to go

00:18:15.970 --> 00:18:22.930 align:middle line:84%
on to the cat named "Ashes,"
because that starts blipping

00:18:22.930 --> 00:18:24.850 align:middle line:84%
in and out of timelines
life and death,

00:18:24.850 --> 00:18:27.910 align:middle line:84%
but the hypnagogic state you're
talking about that we slip

00:18:27.910 --> 00:18:34.180 align:middle line:84%
into, on a personal level, I'm
just noticing more and more how

00:18:34.180 --> 00:18:41.510 align:middle line:84%
visceral and crazy that
is in that, in my case,

00:18:41.510 --> 00:18:44.640 align:middle line:84%
I barely close my
eyes, but I'm fully--

00:18:44.640 --> 00:18:45.440 align:middle line:90%
I'm not asleep.

00:18:45.440 --> 00:18:46.640 align:middle line:90%
I'm fully somewhere else.

00:18:46.640 --> 00:18:49.730 align:middle line:84%
I'm with people somewhere--
somewhere in the world,

00:18:49.730 --> 00:18:52.070 align:middle line:84%
maybe listening in on a
conversation of other people

00:18:52.070 --> 00:18:53.570 align:middle line:90%
at a dining table.

00:18:53.570 --> 00:18:55.940 align:middle line:84%
I'm kind of all over the
place, but I'm there--

00:18:55.940 --> 00:18:58.550 align:middle line:90%
this is not crazy stuff--

00:18:58.550 --> 00:19:00.410 align:middle line:90%
before I go to sleep.

00:19:00.410 --> 00:19:04.760 align:middle line:84%
So in that kind of situation,
assuming other people

00:19:04.760 --> 00:19:09.043 align:middle line:84%
are experiencing this, too, what
do you think's going on there?

00:19:09.043 --> 00:19:11.210 align:middle line:84%
>>LARSON: That's a good
question, and I don't know--

00:19:11.210 --> 00:19:12.520 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Because it almost
never has anything do with me.

00:19:12.520 --> 00:19:14.030 align:middle line:84%
I'm just in other
people's lives.

00:19:14.030 --> 00:19:16.070 align:middle line:90%
I just blip into their reality.

00:19:16.070 --> 00:19:17.570 align:middle line:90%
>>LARSON: Right.

00:19:17.570 --> 00:19:19.682 align:middle line:84%
Well, part of what I
suspect might be going on,

00:19:19.682 --> 00:19:21.140 align:middle line:84%
I don't know for
sure, but it feels

00:19:21.140 --> 00:19:23.990 align:middle line:84%
like that web of consciousness
that I saw where we are

00:19:23.990 --> 00:19:25.710 align:middle line:90%
connected with one another--

00:19:25.710 --> 00:19:27.620 align:middle line:84%
so when you're starting
to fall asleep,

00:19:27.620 --> 00:19:29.627 align:middle line:84%
then you return
to that awareness.

00:19:29.627 --> 00:19:32.210 align:middle line:84%
Like, when you're between lives,
then you can think of someone

00:19:32.210 --> 00:19:33.860 align:middle line:90%
and they're right with you.

00:19:33.860 --> 00:19:36.420 align:middle line:84%
And we can do that when
we're right between waking

00:19:36.420 --> 00:19:37.220 align:middle line:90%
and sleeping.

00:19:37.220 --> 00:19:41.900 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Yes, and I wanted to
bring it up because everybody

00:19:41.900 --> 00:19:45.350 align:middle line:84%
goes through that state of
awareness and maybe to just

00:19:45.350 --> 00:19:46.430 align:middle line:90%
start--

00:19:46.430 --> 00:19:48.330 align:middle line:84%
I didn't pay attention
to it for a long time.

00:19:48.330 --> 00:19:50.600 align:middle line:84%
And then what
happened is my husband

00:19:50.600 --> 00:19:53.180 align:middle line:84%
was talking to me as I
was starting to drift off,

00:19:53.180 --> 00:19:54.890 align:middle line:84%
and I started talking
to him like he was

00:19:54.890 --> 00:19:56.160 align:middle line:90%
one of the people I was with.

00:19:56.160 --> 00:19:58.140 align:middle line:84%
And you thought
-- where are you?

00:19:58.140 --> 00:20:01.040 align:middle line:90%
and started asking questions.

00:20:01.040 --> 00:20:03.950 align:middle line:84%
Because I had him there, I
started paying more attention

00:20:03.950 --> 00:20:07.100 align:middle line:90%
to just how vastly--

00:20:07.100 --> 00:20:10.640 align:middle line:84%
how quick and vastly different
those realities were, are.

00:20:10.640 --> 00:20:11.735 align:middle line:90%
>>LARSON: Yes, yes.

00:20:11.735 --> 00:20:14.290 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So anyway, so we
all need to just pay attention

00:20:14.290 --> 00:20:17.210 align:middle line:84%
when we're crossing over because
there are clues in there.

00:20:17.210 --> 00:20:20.245 align:middle line:84%
>>LARSON: Big clues sometimes,
sometimes small clues.

00:20:20.245 --> 00:20:22.580 align:middle line:84%
But there's no such
thing as noise.

00:20:22.580 --> 00:20:25.790 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Yes, OK, and it's not
just crazy stuff, and firings,

00:20:25.790 --> 00:20:27.320 align:middle line:90%
random firings of the brain.

00:20:27.320 --> 00:20:29.705 align:middle line:90%
Let's go to your cat Ashes.

00:20:29.705 --> 00:20:33.110 align:middle line:84%
>>LARSON: Yes, OK, that's
an interesting experience.

00:20:33.110 --> 00:20:36.110 align:middle line:84%
My roommate that I'd been
living with for many years

00:20:36.110 --> 00:20:38.750 align:middle line:84%
on Cedar Street in Berkeley,
because I was living there

00:20:38.750 --> 00:20:40.820 align:middle line:84%
during my college
days, she had a cat

00:20:40.820 --> 00:20:43.100 align:middle line:84%
that she brought back
from San Diego in the car.

00:20:43.100 --> 00:20:44.550 align:middle line:90%
A car with no air conditioning.

00:20:44.550 --> 00:20:47.420 align:middle line:84%
So that cat had been a
kitten and grown up with me.

00:20:47.420 --> 00:20:50.090 align:middle line:90%
And I'd seen the cat for years.

00:20:50.090 --> 00:20:54.320 align:middle line:84%
And then I moved across the
street to another apartment,

00:20:54.320 --> 00:20:56.583 align:middle line:84%
just across the street
on Cedar Street.

00:20:56.583 --> 00:20:59.000 align:middle line:84%
And the cat, it was close
enough so the cat could actually

00:20:59.000 --> 00:20:59.873 align:middle line:90%
come and visit.

00:20:59.873 --> 00:21:01.790 align:middle line:84%
And I don't know if it
was because I was there

00:21:01.790 --> 00:21:03.730 align:middle line:84%
or he just always
visited that house.

00:21:03.730 --> 00:21:07.310 align:middle line:84%
You know, cats like to wander
if they're outdoor cats.

00:21:07.310 --> 00:21:11.690 align:middle line:84%
So I was having so many good
times with Ashes in the garden.

00:21:11.690 --> 00:21:14.090 align:middle line:84%
And then one day,
I heard the news

00:21:14.090 --> 00:21:16.580 align:middle line:84%
from my roommate Katherine,
I was talking with her,

00:21:16.580 --> 00:21:19.430 align:middle line:84%
and she said, bad
news about Ashes.

00:21:19.430 --> 00:21:21.660 align:middle line:84%
He was hit by a car,
and he passed away.

00:21:21.660 --> 00:21:24.430 align:middle line:84%
And I was devastated
because you know

00:21:24.430 --> 00:21:27.140 align:middle line:84%
when you have such a
good bond with an animal,

00:21:27.140 --> 00:21:28.370 align:middle line:90%
they feel like family.

00:21:28.370 --> 00:21:29.930 align:middle line:90%
He felt like family to me.

00:21:29.930 --> 00:21:34.490 align:middle line:84%
So I was very sad about it,
grief stricken, actually,

00:21:34.490 --> 00:21:37.460 align:middle line:84%
but I felt like I just
wish I had more time.

00:21:37.460 --> 00:21:40.430 align:middle line:84%
I remember thinking that,
feeling it, fully feeling it.

00:21:40.430 --> 00:21:42.340 align:middle line:84%
Like, I needed
more time with him.

00:21:42.340 --> 00:21:43.725 align:middle line:90%
I really felt that way.

00:21:43.725 --> 00:21:44.600 align:middle line:90%
And I just let it go.

00:21:44.600 --> 00:21:46.670 align:middle line:90%
I didn't really obsess about it.

00:21:46.670 --> 00:21:49.350 align:middle line:90%
I didn't dwell on the grief.

00:21:49.350 --> 00:21:53.803 align:middle line:84%
I was able to release it, just,
like, well, phooey, he's gone.

00:21:53.803 --> 00:21:55.220 align:middle line:84%
So I was accepting
that he's gone,

00:21:55.220 --> 00:21:57.500 align:middle line:84%
but also feeling
like I really wish

00:21:57.500 --> 00:21:59.490 align:middle line:90%
I could have had more time.

00:21:59.490 --> 00:22:04.530 align:middle line:84%
And then within a day or two of
that, Ashes was in my garden,

00:22:04.530 --> 00:22:05.750 align:middle line:90%
and I could not believe it.

00:22:05.750 --> 00:22:08.030 align:middle line:90%
And it's like, he's back?

00:22:08.030 --> 00:22:08.830 align:middle line:90%
Wow.

00:22:08.830 --> 00:22:10.850 align:middle line:84%
He looked a little
bit bedraggled,

00:22:10.850 --> 00:22:13.123 align:middle line:84%
kind of when cats
don't wash properly.

00:22:13.123 --> 00:22:15.290 align:middle line:84%
Like, man, Ashes, you're
letting it all go downhill.

00:22:15.290 --> 00:22:16.760 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHTER]

00:22:16.760 --> 00:22:18.350 align:middle line:90%
Pull yourself together.

00:22:18.350 --> 00:22:19.620 align:middle line:90%
But I didn't feel that way.

00:22:19.620 --> 00:22:21.530 align:middle line:84%
I felt mostly gratitude,
like, you're here.

00:22:21.530 --> 00:22:23.390 align:middle line:90%
I love you so much.

00:22:23.390 --> 00:22:25.160 align:middle line:84%
So of course, I hugged
him, and held him,

00:22:25.160 --> 00:22:27.350 align:middle line:84%
and he probably didn't
know, what's the big fuss?

00:22:27.350 --> 00:22:29.517 align:middle line:84%
He seemed to look at me
like, what's this all about?

00:22:29.517 --> 00:22:31.527 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Well, did
anyone else see him?

00:22:31.527 --> 00:22:33.360 align:middle line:84%
>>LARSON: I think I was
married at the time,

00:22:33.360 --> 00:22:36.492 align:middle line:84%
and I asked my husband,
I asked other people,

00:22:36.492 --> 00:22:38.450 align:middle line:84%
do you remember something
different about this?

00:22:38.450 --> 00:22:40.370 align:middle line:84%
And people did not
really remember what

00:22:40.370 --> 00:22:42.212 align:middle line:90%
I remembered, that he'd died.

00:22:42.212 --> 00:22:44.420 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: They didn't remember
that he had ever died?

00:22:44.420 --> 00:22:45.357 align:middle line:90%
>>LARSON: No.

00:22:45.357 --> 00:22:46.940 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: They're
just, there's Ashes.

00:22:46.940 --> 00:22:48.722 align:middle line:84%
He's just looking
a little raggedy?

00:22:48.722 --> 00:22:50.180 align:middle line:84%
>>LARSON: Right,
so here again, I'm

00:22:50.180 --> 00:22:53.060 align:middle line:84%
feeling like I'm kind of on
the outskirts of reality,

00:22:53.060 --> 00:22:55.490 align:middle line:84%
experiencing something that
other people don't think

00:22:55.490 --> 00:22:57.030 align:middle line:90%
is so unusual.

00:22:57.030 --> 00:23:00.537 align:middle line:84%
But I know, for
sure, Ashes had died.

00:23:00.537 --> 00:23:02.370 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: There are so
many of these things,

00:23:02.370 --> 00:23:03.510 align:middle line:90%
and I love these stories.

00:23:03.510 --> 00:23:07.300 align:middle line:84%
And I think, I want people
to hear your stories

00:23:07.300 --> 00:23:09.800 align:middle line:84%
so that, A, people don't think
they're crazy if this happens

00:23:09.800 --> 00:23:12.620 align:middle line:84%
to them, and also to
see what's possible

00:23:12.620 --> 00:23:14.780 align:middle line:84%
and what's actually
playing out on our planet

00:23:14.780 --> 00:23:18.530 align:middle line:84%
right now among some
people or even many people.

00:23:18.530 --> 00:23:21.590 align:middle line:84%
And then, we're going to get
to the nuts and bolts of it.

00:23:21.590 --> 00:23:26.522 align:middle line:84%
Another one, a program
that you had gone to see,

00:23:26.522 --> 00:23:27.980 align:middle line:84%
there was someone
that was supposed

00:23:27.980 --> 00:23:30.705 align:middle line:84%
to speak as I recall at
a conference you went to.

00:23:30.705 --> 00:23:33.080 align:middle line:84%
And you went because you wanted
to see this person speak,

00:23:33.080 --> 00:23:34.027 align:middle line:90%
you were so excited.

00:23:34.027 --> 00:23:36.235 align:middle line:84%
And you got there, and they
weren't even on the menu.

00:23:36.235 --> 00:23:37.260 align:middle line:90%
>>LARSON: Right.

00:23:37.260 --> 00:23:39.410 align:middle line:84%
Well, they were, but
then they weren't.

00:23:39.410 --> 00:23:40.880 align:middle line:90%
It was even weirder than that.

00:23:40.880 --> 00:23:43.910 align:middle line:84%
Yes, so we were staying
just outside of London,

00:23:43.910 --> 00:23:46.585 align:middle line:84%
this cute little hotel, and so
I'm looking at the program--

00:23:46.585 --> 00:23:47.730 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: All excited.

00:23:47.730 --> 00:23:48.830 align:middle line:90%
>>LARSON: Yes.

00:23:48.830 --> 00:23:50.600 align:middle line:84%
And then here's
someone mentioned

00:23:50.600 --> 00:23:52.390 align:middle line:90%
from the company, Ove Arup--

00:23:52.390 --> 00:23:57.140 align:middle line:84%
O-V-E-A-R-U-P. It's a beautiful
architectural and engineering

00:23:57.140 --> 00:23:58.100 align:middle line:90%
design company.

00:23:58.100 --> 00:23:59.690 align:middle line:90%
I thought, wow, they're here?

00:23:59.690 --> 00:24:01.590 align:middle line:90%
This is really cool.

00:24:01.590 --> 00:24:04.550 align:middle line:84%
But then at the break,
I just checked--

00:24:04.550 --> 00:24:07.370 align:middle line:84%
you know when you check to
see, what time will he be on?

00:24:07.370 --> 00:24:10.682 align:middle line:84%
And he was gone, not
just from my program,

00:24:10.682 --> 00:24:12.140 align:middle line:84%
but then, because
it was the break,

00:24:12.140 --> 00:24:14.480 align:middle line:84%
I could surreptitiously
go around, like,

00:24:14.480 --> 00:24:16.862 align:middle line:84%
did this just happen
to my program?

00:24:16.862 --> 00:24:18.320 align:middle line:84%
It was kind of a
crazy thing, but I

00:24:18.320 --> 00:24:20.870 align:middle line:84%
thought, let me check her
program and his program,

00:24:20.870 --> 00:24:24.440 align:middle line:84%
and he was gone from all the
programs across the board.

00:24:24.440 --> 00:24:28.970 align:middle line:84%
And I asked my husband, did you
see this person on the program?

00:24:28.970 --> 00:24:29.860 align:middle line:90%
And he did.

00:24:29.860 --> 00:24:30.860 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Oh, thank god.

00:24:30.860 --> 00:24:32.235 align:middle line:84%
Because otherwise,
by this point,

00:24:32.235 --> 00:24:34.040 align:middle line:84%
you might start
thinking, am I nuts?

00:24:34.040 --> 00:24:34.910 align:middle line:90%
>>LARSON: Right.

00:24:34.910 --> 00:24:38.703 align:middle line:84%
It helps to have someone else
agree, I remember that also.

00:24:38.703 --> 00:24:40.370 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: A lot of
times when you didn't

00:24:40.370 --> 00:24:42.980 align:middle line:84%
have that agreement or other
witnesses, did you think,

00:24:42.980 --> 00:24:45.200 align:middle line:90%
maybe it's just me?

00:24:45.200 --> 00:24:48.440 align:middle line:84%
>>LARSON: No, I still felt
like it's not just me.

00:24:48.440 --> 00:24:49.460 align:middle line:90%
I know what I saw.

00:24:49.460 --> 00:24:51.590 align:middle line:90%
I trusted myself.

00:24:51.590 --> 00:24:54.720 align:middle line:84%
I think, again, it helps to
have remembered from childhood

00:24:54.720 --> 00:24:55.970 align:middle line:90%
that I am pure consciousness.

00:24:55.970 --> 00:24:56.770 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes, absolutely.

00:24:56.770 --> 00:24:58.478 align:middle line:84%
>>LARSON: And I'm a
little bit different.

00:24:58.478 --> 00:24:59.480 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah, so OK.

00:24:59.480 --> 00:25:01.880 align:middle line:84%
Yes, now another thing
that's very interesting

00:25:01.880 --> 00:25:04.070 align:middle line:84%
is you were
witnessed by locating

00:25:04.070 --> 00:25:05.210 align:middle line:90%
on a couple of occasions.

00:25:05.210 --> 00:25:06.350 align:middle line:90%
>>LARSON: Those are cool.

00:25:06.350 --> 00:25:07.933 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Yeah, let's
talk about that.

00:25:07.933 --> 00:25:10.520 align:middle line:10%
>>LARSON: OK, so on
one occasion, I was--

00:25:10.520 --> 00:25:13.580 align:middle line:10%
just, on a cold morning, I
needed to wake my daughters up.

00:25:13.580 --> 00:25:15.920 align:middle line:84%
At that point, I
was divorced, so I

00:25:15.920 --> 00:25:18.740 align:middle line:84%
was just in charge of waking
up my girls every morning.

00:25:18.740 --> 00:25:22.460 align:middle line:84%
And there was a
huge, heavy window

00:25:22.460 --> 00:25:26.130 align:middle line:84%
screen, window shade that was
too heavy for them to move.

00:25:26.130 --> 00:25:28.760 align:middle line:84%
So the normal procedure
is-- and I'm daydreaming it.

00:25:28.760 --> 00:25:31.260 align:middle line:84%
I wake up, but I'm thinking, I
don't want to get out of bed.

00:25:31.260 --> 00:25:32.390 align:middle line:90%
It's too cold.

00:25:32.390 --> 00:25:33.740 align:middle line:90%
I'll just stay here a moment.

00:25:33.740 --> 00:25:35.198 align:middle line:84%
But then, there's
part of me that's

00:25:35.198 --> 00:25:37.010 align:middle line:84%
rehearsing, like,
I'm just pretending

00:25:37.010 --> 00:25:38.860 align:middle line:84%
like I'm going to get out
of bed, walk down the hall.

00:25:38.860 --> 00:25:40.550 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Thinking about
what you're going to do next.

00:25:40.550 --> 00:25:41.060 align:middle line:90%
>>LARSON: I'm thinking about.

00:25:41.060 --> 00:25:42.143 align:middle line:90%
I'm flipping on the light.

00:25:42.143 --> 00:25:43.220 align:middle line:90%
Good morning, girls.

00:25:43.220 --> 00:25:46.100 align:middle line:90%
I pull open the window shade.

00:25:46.100 --> 00:25:48.720 align:middle line:84%
Time to get up, rise
and shine or whatever.

00:25:48.720 --> 00:25:50.630 align:middle line:84%
And so I'm just
thinking all that.

00:25:50.630 --> 00:25:53.960 align:middle line:84%
And then I hear sort of
voices down the hall,

00:25:53.960 --> 00:25:57.608 align:middle line:84%
and then a little pitter patter
of my girls running to my room,

00:25:57.608 --> 00:25:59.150 align:middle line:84%
like, Mommy, they're
calling my name.

00:25:59.150 --> 00:26:00.230 align:middle line:90%
Where are you?

00:26:00.230 --> 00:26:01.470 align:middle line:90%
Mom?

00:26:01.470 --> 00:26:02.840 align:middle line:90%
Like, I'm in here.

00:26:02.840 --> 00:26:03.710 align:middle line:90%
You guys are up?

00:26:03.710 --> 00:26:06.740 align:middle line:84%
They said, yes, what are
you doing back in bed?

00:26:06.740 --> 00:26:10.050 align:middle line:84%
And I said, what do
you mean back in bed?

00:26:10.050 --> 00:26:11.960 align:middle line:90%
Like, you saw me already?

00:26:11.960 --> 00:26:13.700 align:middle line:90%
They said, yes, you were up.

00:26:13.700 --> 00:26:17.270 align:middle line:84%
And I walked to their room,
and I saw the light was on.

00:26:17.270 --> 00:26:18.890 align:middle line:84%
Someone had opened
their window shade.

00:26:18.890 --> 00:26:19.940 align:middle line:90%
It wasn't them.

00:26:19.940 --> 00:26:22.152 align:middle line:90%
No one else was in the house.

00:26:22.152 --> 00:26:24.610 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Then someone else
saw you walking down the street

00:26:24.610 --> 00:26:25.870 align:middle line:90%
when you were somewhere else?

00:26:25.870 --> 00:26:27.820 align:middle line:84%
>>LARSON: Yes, I
was at a book event.

00:26:27.820 --> 00:26:29.450 align:middle line:84%
And it was a
beautiful day, and so

00:26:29.450 --> 00:26:31.283 align:middle line:84%
I'm kind of looking out
the window thinking,

00:26:31.283 --> 00:26:33.360 align:middle line:90%
I wish I was out there.

00:26:33.360 --> 00:26:34.865 align:middle line:90%
I've been here for hours.

00:26:34.865 --> 00:26:35.740 align:middle line:90%
I want to be outside.

00:26:35.740 --> 00:26:37.540 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So for you, you
just think it and part of you

00:26:37.540 --> 00:26:38.500 align:middle line:90%
manifests there?

00:26:38.500 --> 00:26:39.300 align:middle line:90%
>>LARSON: Right.

00:26:39.300 --> 00:26:41.800 align:middle line:84%
So for me, daydreaming
could very well

00:26:41.800 --> 00:26:43.330 align:middle line:90%
mean that I'm bi-locating.

00:26:43.330 --> 00:26:44.150 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:26:44.150 --> 00:26:45.692 align:middle line:84%
>>LARSON: Some people
have teleported

00:26:45.692 --> 00:26:50.140 align:middle line:84%
with this same kind of thing,
where you need it that much,

00:26:50.140 --> 00:26:53.740 align:middle line:84%
so you're inside one minute, and
then literally somewhere else.

00:26:53.740 --> 00:26:56.140 align:middle line:84%
I haven't done that
yet, but who knows.

00:26:56.140 --> 00:26:58.305 align:middle line:84%
It's just the next
step from bilocation.

00:26:58.305 --> 00:27:00.380 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:27:00.380 --> 00:27:03.050 align:middle line:84%
I mean, most people are
stop-- probably pausing,

00:27:03.050 --> 00:27:05.185 align:middle line:84%
let me think about
this for a second,

00:27:05.185 --> 00:27:07.060 align:middle line:90%
but we're going to continue on.

00:27:07.060 --> 00:27:10.750 align:middle line:84%
OK, so this goes on and on,
where you walk past the place

00:27:10.750 --> 00:27:13.630 align:middle line:84%
where you've known it for
years and years to be this way,

00:27:13.630 --> 00:27:16.392 align:middle line:84%
and then you walk past it, and
it's structured differently,

00:27:16.392 --> 00:27:18.850 align:middle line:84%
and there's a big thing, like,
in this one case in Berkeley

00:27:18.850 --> 00:27:20.250 align:middle line:90%
Marina, big sundial there.

00:27:20.250 --> 00:27:22.360 align:middle line:84%
It's like, where'd
that come from?

00:27:22.360 --> 00:27:25.300 align:middle line:84%
And everyone says, well,
that's always been here.

00:27:25.300 --> 00:27:26.350 align:middle line:90%
>>LARSON: Right.

00:27:26.350 --> 00:27:28.450 align:middle line:84%
I was walking with my two
friends who also thought

00:27:28.450 --> 00:27:30.340 align:middle line:84%
it was unusual because
all three of us

00:27:30.340 --> 00:27:32.110 align:middle line:84%
remembered we had
previously walked right

00:27:32.110 --> 00:27:33.540 align:middle line:90%
through the courtyard.

00:27:33.540 --> 00:27:36.190 align:middle line:84%
And in fact, we had
an unobstructed view

00:27:36.190 --> 00:27:39.280 align:middle line:84%
previously of another
sculpture that was there.

00:27:39.280 --> 00:27:42.530 align:middle line:84%
And now, here it is, this
huge 20-foot tall concrete

00:27:42.530 --> 00:27:43.330 align:middle line:90%
sculpture--

00:27:43.330 --> 00:27:45.247 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: That doesn't
just come in overnight.

00:27:45.247 --> 00:27:47.890 align:middle line:84%
>>LARSON: No, it said it'd been
there since 1970-something.

00:27:47.890 --> 00:27:50.230 align:middle line:84%
The harbor master, I
found the harbor master,

00:27:50.230 --> 00:27:52.620 align:middle line:84%
and he said it's
been there for years.

00:27:52.620 --> 00:27:56.020 align:middle line:84%
It's this gift from a
sister city in Japan.

00:27:56.020 --> 00:27:59.410 align:middle line:84%
So clearly, things can
change in just a moment.

00:27:59.410 --> 00:28:01.355 align:middle line:84%
It looked like they've
been there for decades.

00:28:01.355 --> 00:28:04.720 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And it starts
getting really disconcerting.

00:28:04.720 --> 00:28:06.205 align:middle line:90%
Like, what is reality?

00:28:06.205 --> 00:28:07.005 align:middle line:90%
>>LARSON: Right.

00:28:07.005 --> 00:28:09.182 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: I mean, you flow
with it because you know

00:28:09.182 --> 00:28:10.420 align:middle line:90%
these things are malleable.

00:28:10.420 --> 00:28:12.570 align:middle line:84%
Most people start
thinking they're insane

00:28:12.570 --> 00:28:14.230 align:middle line:90%
or that something's wrong.

00:28:14.230 --> 00:28:16.270 align:middle line:84%
You know, this is
very disconcerting for

00:28:16.270 --> 00:28:18.310 align:middle line:90%
the vast majority of humanity.

00:28:18.310 --> 00:28:22.210 align:middle line:84%
So now, we go into the whole
notion of Nelson Mandela

00:28:22.210 --> 00:28:23.047 align:middle line:90%
and his death.

00:28:23.047 --> 00:28:25.130 align:middle line:84%
That's really where this
whole thing got its name.

00:28:25.130 --> 00:28:27.410 align:middle line:84%
It started out on
the Art Bell show.

00:28:27.410 --> 00:28:29.860 align:middle line:84%
Just explain it so we have
an identity of why it's

00:28:29.860 --> 00:28:31.240 align:middle line:90%
called "the Mandela 'effect."

00:28:31.240 --> 00:28:36.070 align:middle line:84%
>>LARSON: OK, well, clearly,
Nelson Mandela has died now.

00:28:36.070 --> 00:28:37.240 align:middle line:90%
Everybody knows that.

00:28:37.240 --> 00:28:39.296 align:middle line:84%
But there was a time
period, I think currently--

00:28:39.296 --> 00:28:40.096 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Or is he?

00:28:40.096 --> 00:28:40.896 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHS]

00:28:40.896 --> 00:28:42.370 align:middle line:90%
>>LARSON: I know.

00:28:42.370 --> 00:28:43.380 align:middle line:90%
That's a good question.

00:28:43.380 --> 00:28:47.110 align:middle line:84%
Well, I think,
currently, is dead.

00:28:47.110 --> 00:28:49.390 align:middle line:90%
He died in, I think, 2013.

00:28:49.390 --> 00:28:51.910 align:middle line:84%
And the surprising thing
for a lot of people

00:28:51.910 --> 00:28:55.540 align:middle line:84%
is after he passed
away, people remembered,

00:28:55.540 --> 00:28:57.840 align:middle line:84%
I thought he died
way before this,

00:28:57.840 --> 00:29:00.250 align:middle line:84%
like back in the '80s
when he was still

00:29:00.250 --> 00:29:02.170 align:middle line:90%
in jail on Robin's Island.

00:29:02.170 --> 00:29:04.690 align:middle line:90%


00:29:04.690 --> 00:29:06.820 align:middle line:84%
This became a
topic that Art Bell

00:29:06.820 --> 00:29:11.920 align:middle line:84%
was getting flooded with calls,
faxes, telegrams, everything.

00:29:11.920 --> 00:29:16.730 align:middle line:84%
So he mentioned it in April,
2001, on his radio show.

00:29:16.730 --> 00:29:19.030 align:middle line:84%
And then it took a
while for these things

00:29:19.030 --> 00:29:21.130 align:middle line:84%
to kind of bubble up
through consciousness,

00:29:21.130 --> 00:29:24.730 align:middle line:84%
but I think Fiona Broome
then kind of captured

00:29:24.730 --> 00:29:28.030 align:middle line:84%
the zeitgeist of the
times, right by about 2010,

00:29:28.030 --> 00:29:30.070 align:middle line:84%
and then said, this
is a Mandela effect

00:29:30.070 --> 00:29:32.893 align:middle line:84%
because there are enough
of us that remember

00:29:32.893 --> 00:29:34.060 align:middle line:90%
that there was a different--

00:29:34.060 --> 00:29:35.410 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: That he had
died while in prison.

00:29:35.410 --> 00:29:37.520 align:middle line:84%
>>LARSON: That he did
die while in prison.

00:29:37.520 --> 00:29:40.030 align:middle line:90%
And in 2010, he was still alive.

00:29:40.030 --> 00:29:42.220 align:middle line:84%
So at that point, it
was like, he's alive.

00:29:42.220 --> 00:29:43.670 align:middle line:90%
He's not dead.

00:29:43.670 --> 00:29:47.590 align:middle line:84%
And that creates the idea that
there are alternate realities.

00:29:47.590 --> 00:29:49.780 align:middle line:84%
Lots of people
can remember them,

00:29:49.780 --> 00:29:52.840 align:middle line:84%
and it can be a shared community
experience, where we all

00:29:52.840 --> 00:29:55.300 align:middle line:84%
collectively, in
large groups, remember

00:29:55.300 --> 00:29:58.496 align:middle line:84%
a completely different
series of events.

00:29:58.496 --> 00:30:02.050 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: OK, now, we
talked a little bit

00:30:02.050 --> 00:30:03.490 align:middle line:84%
in the past about
this and showed

00:30:03.490 --> 00:30:06.010 align:middle line:84%
some of the imagery, of some
of the kind of common ones

00:30:06.010 --> 00:30:11.860 align:middle line:84%
from our childhood, for example,
the Berenstain Bears, Gif

00:30:11.860 --> 00:30:15.310 align:middle line:84%
versus Jiffy peanut butter,
and some of the others.

00:30:15.310 --> 00:30:19.850 align:middle line:84%
And when I was watching
your presentation,

00:30:19.850 --> 00:30:23.100 align:middle line:84%
you were talking about some of
those and added a few new ones.

00:30:23.100 --> 00:30:26.470 align:middle line:84%
And one of them popped in, and
I thought, oh, no, come on.

00:30:26.470 --> 00:30:29.170 align:middle line:84%
Because I thought, I could check
this out on the web, right?

00:30:29.170 --> 00:30:32.860 align:middle line:84%
And you said that the
name of Oscar Wilde's

00:30:32.860 --> 00:30:36.025 align:middle line:84%
book, "A Portrait of Dorian
Gray" had been changed.

00:30:36.025 --> 00:30:38.090 align:middle line:90%
>>LARSON: Yes.

00:30:38.090 --> 00:30:40.570 align:middle line:84%
That's one for those of
us that like literature

00:30:40.570 --> 00:30:43.160 align:middle line:84%
because we do remember The
Portrait of Dorian Gray.

00:30:43.160 --> 00:30:47.600 align:middle line:84%
And now, it's only
ever always been

00:30:47.600 --> 00:30:49.358 align:middle line:90%
"A Picture of Dorian Gray."

00:30:49.358 --> 00:30:50.900 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Right,
and I thought, well,

00:30:50.900 --> 00:30:53.300 align:middle line:84%
surely, we could look into
this and see where it changed

00:30:53.300 --> 00:30:54.350 align:middle line:90%
and what happened.

00:30:54.350 --> 00:30:56.185 align:middle line:84%
And so I just thought,
no, I'm just--

00:30:56.185 --> 00:30:57.560 align:middle line:84%
because I'd looked
at the others,

00:30:57.560 --> 00:31:01.070 align:middle line:84%
and I remembered virtually
all of the other examples

00:31:01.070 --> 00:31:03.620 align:middle line:84%
you had used the way
you remembered them

00:31:03.620 --> 00:31:06.560 align:middle line:84%
and the way the vast majority
of people remembered them.

00:31:06.560 --> 00:31:07.990 align:middle line:90%
And so I thought, this is odd.

00:31:07.990 --> 00:31:10.448 align:middle line:90%
No, that can't be.

00:31:10.448 --> 00:31:12.990 align:middle line:84%
And so I just picked this one
up and thought I'd run with it.

00:31:12.990 --> 00:31:14.200 align:middle line:90%
So I went online.

00:31:14.200 --> 00:31:16.130 align:middle line:84%
And an interesting
thing occurred.

00:31:16.130 --> 00:31:20.890 align:middle line:84%
I wrote, Portrait of Dorian
Gray in the search bar.

00:31:20.890 --> 00:31:23.120 align:middle line:84%
And a page popped
up with one listing

00:31:23.120 --> 00:31:25.520 align:middle line:84%
after another, one
link after another

00:31:25.520 --> 00:31:28.580 align:middle line:84%
under "The Portrait
of Dorian Gray."

00:31:28.580 --> 00:31:30.700 align:middle line:84%
And I thought, see,
it's right there.

00:31:30.700 --> 00:31:32.910 align:middle line:84%
And I thought, I wonder
what she was talking about.

00:31:32.910 --> 00:31:34.680 align:middle line:90%
It's right there.

00:31:34.680 --> 00:31:37.910 align:middle line:84%
And I clicked on one of
them, went to a page,

00:31:37.910 --> 00:31:40.200 align:middle line:84%
and then it popped up, "A
Picture of Dorian Gray."

00:31:40.200 --> 00:31:41.000 align:middle line:90%
I thought.

00:31:41.000 --> 00:31:44.070 align:middle line:84%
OK, now this is what
Cynthia was talking about,

00:31:44.070 --> 00:31:46.580 align:middle line:84%
but let me go back to
that previous page.

00:31:46.580 --> 00:31:50.060 align:middle line:84%
Hit the back button, all
those had shifted over

00:31:50.060 --> 00:31:51.680 align:middle line:90%
to "A Picture."

00:31:51.680 --> 00:31:53.450 align:middle line:84%
I couldn't force with
the search term--

00:31:53.450 --> 00:31:55.790 align:middle line:84%
I could not force it
back up to ever get

00:31:55.790 --> 00:31:59.620 align:middle line:84%
a page with all those "Portrait
of Dorian Gray" links.

00:31:59.620 --> 00:32:00.420 align:middle line:90%
>>LARSON: Right.

00:32:00.420 --> 00:32:01.220 align:middle line:90%
Right.

00:32:01.220 --> 00:32:03.310 align:middle line:84%
This is one of the most
convincing experiences.

00:32:03.310 --> 00:32:07.220 align:middle line:84%
It's called, in the
vernacular, a flip-flop.

00:32:07.220 --> 00:32:10.310 align:middle line:84%
So it's like, you see one thing,
and then it changes to another.

00:32:10.310 --> 00:32:12.650 align:middle line:84%
And you know you can trust
yourself that you saw that.

00:32:12.650 --> 00:32:13.520 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Oh, yeah.

00:32:13.520 --> 00:32:14.520 align:middle line:90%
>>LARSON: You know for sure.

00:32:14.520 --> 00:32:17.000 align:middle line:84%
Even though there's no proof,
you can't convince somebody--

00:32:17.000 --> 00:32:17.660 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: No, I saw it there.

00:32:17.660 --> 00:32:18.110 align:middle line:90%
That's why I clicked on it.

00:32:18.110 --> 00:32:18.680 align:middle line:90%
>>LARSON: But you saw it.

00:32:18.680 --> 00:32:19.630 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah, exactly.

00:32:19.630 --> 00:32:21.800 align:middle line:84%
And I thought, see, there
are a whole bunch of them.

00:32:21.800 --> 00:32:25.550 align:middle line:84%
Well, ultimately, I
just kept poking around.

00:32:25.550 --> 00:32:28.580 align:middle line:84%
And finally, I said
to Zeus, check it out.

00:32:28.580 --> 00:32:29.930 align:middle line:90%
He's a good researcher.

00:32:29.930 --> 00:32:32.180 align:middle line:84%
He said, well, there's
some mention of it

00:32:32.180 --> 00:32:35.360 align:middle line:84%
in a French edition of
something from back when.

00:32:35.360 --> 00:32:39.650 align:middle line:84%
And the only thing I did find by
way of reference was on Amazon.

00:32:39.650 --> 00:32:42.470 align:middle line:84%
>>LARSON: I think there's one
book that someone has come out

00:32:42.470 --> 00:32:45.230 align:middle line:84%
with-- because so many of
us remember "The Portrait."

00:32:45.230 --> 00:32:46.940 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And it's
called that, and I

00:32:46.940 --> 00:32:49.070 align:middle line:84%
didn't see the
shadowed small writing

00:32:49.070 --> 00:32:50.690 align:middle line:90%
across the top of the book.

00:32:50.690 --> 00:32:54.200 align:middle line:84%
It just had, the portrait,
literally, of Dorian Gray,

00:32:54.200 --> 00:32:56.600 align:middle line:84%
and the words "Dorian
Gray," and so I

00:32:56.600 --> 00:32:58.850 align:middle line:84%
thought it said, a
portrait of Dorian Gray.

00:32:58.850 --> 00:33:01.670 align:middle line:84%
And in fact, I ordered the
book, and then I looked closer

00:33:01.670 --> 00:33:03.260 align:middle line:90%
because it was so shadowy.

00:33:03.260 --> 00:33:05.210 align:middle line:84%
It was, too, "A Picture
of Dorian Gray."

00:33:05.210 --> 00:33:08.340 align:middle line:84%
Every single thing he found,
like what you're talking about,

00:33:08.340 --> 00:33:12.200 align:middle line:84%
1945 editions, the name is
now "Picture of Dorian Gray."

00:33:12.200 --> 00:33:13.205 align:middle line:90%
>>LARSON: Right.

00:33:13.205 --> 00:33:16.220 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And so
I thought, God, I

00:33:16.220 --> 00:33:21.260 align:middle line:84%
try to get behind the nature
of things and how it works.

00:33:21.260 --> 00:33:23.930 align:middle line:84%
And that's kind of what I
want to talk to you about.

00:33:23.930 --> 00:33:28.830 align:middle line:84%
What is happening, in a very
mechanical way, so to speak?

00:33:28.830 --> 00:33:31.620 align:middle line:84%
>>LARSON: OK well
first of all, we're

00:33:31.620 --> 00:33:34.210 align:middle line:84%
going to get into consciousness
in quantum physics.

00:33:34.210 --> 00:33:36.870 align:middle line:84%
That's where the only
explanations lie.

00:33:36.870 --> 00:33:39.660 align:middle line:84%
And it's not a cheat to go
there because, actually, we've

00:33:39.660 --> 00:33:40.460 align:middle line:90%
known--

00:33:40.460 --> 00:33:41.350 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: That's where
it's playing out.

00:33:41.350 --> 00:33:43.058 align:middle line:84%
>>LARSON: That is
where it's playing out.

00:33:43.058 --> 00:33:44.830 align:middle line:84%
And even Max Born
said that there's

00:33:44.830 --> 00:33:48.100 align:middle line:84%
no way that we can
consider even the material,

00:33:48.100 --> 00:33:50.680 align:middle line:84%
solid things like this
table as being anything

00:33:50.680 --> 00:33:54.070 align:middle line:84%
other than probability
waves because all of matter

00:33:54.070 --> 00:33:55.010 align:middle line:90%
is energy.

00:33:55.010 --> 00:33:58.010 align:middle line:84%
So where this is playing
out, as I see it,

00:33:58.010 --> 00:34:01.660 align:middle line:84%
is reflective cognition,
which is an idea of the way

00:34:01.660 --> 00:34:02.620 align:middle line:90%
that we pay attention.

00:34:02.620 --> 00:34:04.930 align:middle line:84%
The way that we pay
attention and the levels

00:34:04.930 --> 00:34:07.490 align:middle line:84%
that we pay attention
are everything.

00:34:07.490 --> 00:34:12.605 align:middle line:84%
And if you look at the work of
a philosopher named Gottfried

00:34:12.605 --> 00:34:16.340 align:middle line:84%
Wilhelm Leibniz, a
tongue twister, but let's

00:34:16.340 --> 00:34:17.590 align:middle line:90%
just call him Leibniz.

00:34:17.590 --> 00:34:22.150 align:middle line:84%
He actually said that there are
different levels of awareness.

00:34:22.150 --> 00:34:24.429 align:middle line:84%
There's the first
level of awareness,

00:34:24.429 --> 00:34:26.080 align:middle line:84%
and then there's
a, what you call,

00:34:26.080 --> 00:34:29.170 align:middle line:84%
a reflective level, where
you're aware of being aware.

00:34:29.170 --> 00:34:32.739 align:middle line:84%
That's really what we
call consciousness.

00:34:32.739 --> 00:34:35.530 align:middle line:84%
And when you tap
into that, that's

00:34:35.530 --> 00:34:39.159 align:middle line:84%
where you can start witnessing
these kinds of reality

00:34:39.159 --> 00:34:41.949 align:middle line:84%
shifts, whether it's starting
a car where the starter doesn't

00:34:41.949 --> 00:34:45.565 align:middle line:84%
work or any of these examples
that we've talked about.

00:34:45.565 --> 00:34:48.730 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Well, you said
this, that we are not

00:34:48.730 --> 00:34:50.110 align:middle line:90%
a single operator.

00:34:50.110 --> 00:34:53.860 align:middle line:84%
We think we have one mind,
we remember from one place,

00:34:53.860 --> 00:34:56.199 align:middle line:84%
but what you say is very
true because you bring

00:34:56.199 --> 00:34:59.300 align:middle line:84%
in the notion, we
are a combination,

00:34:59.300 --> 00:35:02.950 align:middle line:84%
a complex of conscious
mind, subconscious mind,

00:35:02.950 --> 00:35:08.020 align:middle line:84%
super-conscious mind, soul--
all these dimensions of mind

00:35:08.020 --> 00:35:10.360 align:middle line:84%
are operating in
a single moment,

00:35:10.360 --> 00:35:13.750 align:middle line:84%
but we're only aware,
usually, of one of those.

00:35:13.750 --> 00:35:14.950 align:middle line:90%
>>LARSON: Right.

00:35:14.950 --> 00:35:18.160 align:middle line:84%
And so this is where the
awareness, how you are paying

00:35:18.160 --> 00:35:20.365 align:middle line:90%
attention makes the difference.

00:35:20.365 --> 00:35:23.860 align:middle line:84%
When you remember,
oh, I am all of this--

00:35:23.860 --> 00:35:25.942 align:middle line:84%
so it's just the difference
between thinking,

00:35:25.942 --> 00:35:28.150 align:middle line:84%
like a little child might
be saying, I want a cookie.

00:35:28.150 --> 00:35:29.740 align:middle line:90%
I want an ice cream.

00:35:29.740 --> 00:35:32.750 align:middle line:84%
But then when you tap into
the fullness of your being,

00:35:32.750 --> 00:35:35.110 align:middle line:84%
you're in a different place,
state of mind entirely.

00:35:35.110 --> 00:35:38.990 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Yes, so let's
go back to Dorian Gray.

00:35:38.990 --> 00:35:39.790 align:middle line:90%
>>LARSON: Right.

00:35:39.790 --> 00:35:44.230 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: How does that
collective memory--

00:35:44.230 --> 00:35:48.520 align:middle line:84%
you have a collective memory,
and now a changed material

00:35:48.520 --> 00:35:50.550 align:middle line:90%
reality.

00:35:50.550 --> 00:35:51.960 align:middle line:90%
What happened?

00:35:51.960 --> 00:35:52.880 align:middle line:90%
What happens there?

00:35:52.880 --> 00:35:55.020 align:middle line:84%
>>LARSON: OK, well,
what I look at, again,

00:35:55.020 --> 00:35:57.960 align:middle line:84%
I go back, of course, to quantum
physics because, there, you

00:35:57.960 --> 00:36:00.030 align:middle line:84%
can see the way
things are working,

00:36:00.030 --> 00:36:02.910 align:middle line:84%
not just on the quantum
scale but on all scales.

00:36:02.910 --> 00:36:06.120 align:middle line:84%
So quantum physics
is the universal set.

00:36:06.120 --> 00:36:08.310 align:middle line:90%
This is our true reality.

00:36:08.310 --> 00:36:10.440 align:middle line:84%
And within the realm
of quantum physics,

00:36:10.440 --> 00:36:14.010 align:middle line:84%
we know we are
entangled with others,

00:36:14.010 --> 00:36:16.710 align:middle line:84%
like that web of
consciousness isn't tangled.

00:36:16.710 --> 00:36:21.360 align:middle line:84%
So all of those of us who
are sharing intentions,

00:36:21.360 --> 00:36:24.930 align:middle line:84%
maybe to see how good it
can get to desire to see

00:36:24.930 --> 00:36:29.880 align:middle line:84%
an improvement of consciousness
on the planet, we're connected.

00:36:29.880 --> 00:36:31.410 align:middle line:90%
We're very much connected.

00:36:31.410 --> 00:36:33.630 align:middle line:84%
And those of us who
have those intentions

00:36:33.630 --> 00:36:38.032 align:middle line:84%
are definitely, at this
time, observing huge changes

00:36:38.032 --> 00:36:38.865 align:middle line:90%
in physical reality.

00:36:38.865 --> 00:36:41.160 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Absolutely.

00:36:41.160 --> 00:36:43.050 align:middle line:84%
I guess the question
would be, there

00:36:43.050 --> 00:36:48.510 align:middle line:84%
had to be a mind somewhere,
an intention, or a consensus

00:36:48.510 --> 00:36:51.360 align:middle line:84%
that, for some reason, "A
Portrait of Dorian Gray"

00:36:51.360 --> 00:36:56.840 align:middle line:84%
was maybe outmoded,
outdated, that maybe the word

00:36:56.840 --> 00:36:59.630 align:middle line:90%
"picture" would serve better?

00:36:59.630 --> 00:37:00.640 align:middle line:90%
You see what I'm saying?

00:37:00.640 --> 00:37:01.440 align:middle line:90%
>>LARSON: Yes.

00:37:01.440 --> 00:37:05.450 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Where in there did
something spin into motion

00:37:05.450 --> 00:37:07.430 align:middle line:84%
or was something
placed into motion

00:37:07.430 --> 00:37:10.715 align:middle line:84%
that then could go and change
our quantum physical reality?

00:37:10.715 --> 00:37:11.720 align:middle line:90%
>>LARSON: Exactly.

00:37:11.720 --> 00:37:14.660 align:middle line:84%
Well, this is a question that
came up at our Mandela Effect

00:37:14.660 --> 00:37:15.880 align:middle line:90%
Conference that happened.

00:37:15.880 --> 00:37:19.880 align:middle line:84%
The first one was in
Idaho, and we had talks--

00:37:19.880 --> 00:37:22.160 align:middle line:84%
many of the speakers
talked about, how can

00:37:22.160 --> 00:37:25.470 align:middle line:84%
you can look deeper to find
the message in such a shift.

00:37:25.470 --> 00:37:27.380 align:middle line:84%
So then, you could
ask the question,

00:37:27.380 --> 00:37:29.690 align:middle line:84%
what is it about the
change, like you suggested,

00:37:29.690 --> 00:37:31.858 align:middle line:84%
from "A Portrait"
to "A Picture."

00:37:31.858 --> 00:37:32.900 align:middle line:90%
And I think you're right.

00:37:32.900 --> 00:37:35.870 align:middle line:84%
There is much more awareness
now of what a picture

00:37:35.870 --> 00:37:37.893 align:middle line:90%
is because we have cameras.

00:37:37.893 --> 00:37:38.810 align:middle line:90%
We work with pictures.

00:37:38.810 --> 00:37:41.150 align:middle line:84%
We don't typically get a
portrait done of someone.

00:37:41.150 --> 00:37:42.020 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:37:42.020 --> 00:37:43.370 align:middle line:90%
Portraits are of the past.

00:37:43.370 --> 00:37:45.090 align:middle line:84%
>>LARSON: Some people
still paint them.

00:37:45.090 --> 00:37:46.715 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: But for
the most part, that's

00:37:46.715 --> 00:37:50.690 align:middle line:84%
a thing of the past, where
pics, pic, pix, pics,

00:37:50.690 --> 00:37:52.610 align:middle line:84%
all of that, everyone
knows what a picture is.

00:37:52.610 --> 00:37:58.190 align:middle line:84%
So somehow in the zeitgeist
of our modern consciousness,

00:37:58.190 --> 00:38:03.470 align:middle line:84%
we relate to the word
"picture," and so are kind

00:38:03.470 --> 00:38:08.150 align:middle line:84%
of relational mind impressed in
your physical reality on that.

00:38:08.150 --> 00:38:10.820 align:middle line:84%
>>LARSON: Right, so you could
consider it closer to truth,

00:38:10.820 --> 00:38:13.220 align:middle line:84%
and that's what a lot of
these Mandela effects--

00:38:13.220 --> 00:38:16.400 align:middle line:84%
if you look deep enough, you
can start seeing, oh, that

00:38:16.400 --> 00:38:18.560 align:middle line:90%
is closer to truth.

00:38:18.560 --> 00:38:20.365 align:middle line:90%
That is a revelation of truth.

00:38:20.365 --> 00:38:25.010 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And so that's the part
that I think always kind of got

00:38:25.010 --> 00:38:26.450 align:middle line:90%
me is, what would drive that?

00:38:26.450 --> 00:38:27.943 align:middle line:90%
There has to be an intention?

00:38:27.943 --> 00:38:29.360 align:middle line:84%
And there has to
be a thought form

00:38:29.360 --> 00:38:31.630 align:middle line:84%
to allow anything to
magnetized toward it

00:38:31.630 --> 00:38:33.410 align:middle line:90%
to shift physical reality.

00:38:33.410 --> 00:38:34.822 align:middle line:90%
>>LARSON: Right.

00:38:34.822 --> 00:38:37.770 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: OK, so
what, to you, are

00:38:37.770 --> 00:38:40.950 align:middle line:84%
some of the more kind
of fascinating examples

00:38:40.950 --> 00:38:43.980 align:middle line:84%
when you're looking at this
collective resonance that's

00:38:43.980 --> 00:38:46.415 align:middle line:90%
changing physical reality?

00:38:46.415 --> 00:38:47.915 align:middle line:84%
>>LARSON: There's
so many good ones.

00:38:47.915 --> 00:38:49.650 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah, share.

00:38:49.650 --> 00:38:52.500 align:middle line:84%
No, it's fascinating because
you explained it very simply

00:38:52.500 --> 00:38:53.870 align:middle line:90%
and very eloquently.

00:38:53.870 --> 00:38:55.680 align:middle line:84%
And now, we can start
inserting herself

00:38:55.680 --> 00:38:58.710 align:middle line:84%
into understanding
where we are, how we're

00:38:58.710 --> 00:39:00.600 align:middle line:90%
participating in this, too.

00:39:00.600 --> 00:39:02.430 align:middle line:84%
>>LARSON: We're
absolutely participating.

00:39:02.430 --> 00:39:05.490 align:middle line:84%
Because right now, we're just
disconcerted and you're like,

00:39:05.490 --> 00:39:06.390 align:middle line:90%
what happened?

00:39:06.390 --> 00:39:07.865 align:middle line:90%
What just happened to me?

00:39:07.865 --> 00:39:09.990 align:middle line:84%
It's like, we don't know
we're steering this thing.

00:39:09.990 --> 00:39:10.860 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Exactly.

00:39:10.860 --> 00:39:12.068 align:middle line:90%
>>LARSON: Like, who did that?

00:39:12.068 --> 00:39:13.748 align:middle line:84%
And a lot of finger
pointing goes on.

00:39:13.748 --> 00:39:15.790 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And then you
get into conspiracy theory

00:39:15.790 --> 00:39:16.500 align:middle line:90%
and everything else.

00:39:16.500 --> 00:39:18.180 align:middle line:84%
>>LARSON: And we don't
need to go there.

00:39:18.180 --> 00:39:19.980 align:middle line:84%
Because clearly,
we are doing this.

00:39:19.980 --> 00:39:21.355 align:middle line:84%
And that's why
it's starting with

00:39:21.355 --> 00:39:22.950 align:middle line:90%
these little gentle shifts.

00:39:22.950 --> 00:39:25.110 align:middle line:84%
So at the conference,
we had an artist

00:39:25.110 --> 00:39:27.090 align:middle line:90%
who brought a series of images.

00:39:27.090 --> 00:39:28.567 align:middle line:90%
And she had one--

00:39:28.567 --> 00:39:30.150 align:middle line:84%
they would be from
different examples.

00:39:30.150 --> 00:39:32.940 align:middle line:84%
Like, there was the
movie, Field of Dreams,

00:39:32.940 --> 00:39:35.460 align:middle line:84%
and you remember the
line in that movie,

00:39:35.460 --> 00:39:36.460 align:middle line:90%
"If you will build it--

00:39:36.460 --> 00:39:37.080 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Build
it, they will come.

00:39:37.080 --> 00:39:38.160 align:middle line:90%
>>LARSON: "--they will come."

00:39:38.160 --> 00:39:39.480 align:middle line:90%
And now, it's never been that.

00:39:39.480 --> 00:39:42.750 align:middle line:84%
It's just, "If you
build it, he will come."

00:39:42.750 --> 00:39:44.125 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: No, it was they will--

00:39:44.125 --> 00:39:45.500 align:middle line:84%
I remember it as,
they will come.

00:39:45.500 --> 00:39:45.586 align:middle line:90%
>>LARSON: I know.

00:39:45.586 --> 00:39:46.210 align:middle line:90%
I remember that, too.

00:39:46.210 --> 00:39:46.740 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Who's he?

00:39:46.740 --> 00:39:48.240 align:middle line:84%
>>LARSON: Well,
that's the question.

00:39:48.240 --> 00:39:49.210 align:middle line:90%
What does that mean?

00:39:49.210 --> 00:39:50.955 align:middle line:90%
And how is that a deeper truth?

00:39:50.955 --> 00:39:51.805 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:39:51.805 --> 00:39:52.660 align:middle line:90%
Than they.

00:39:52.660 --> 00:39:53.700 align:middle line:90%
Right, exactly.

00:39:53.700 --> 00:39:55.235 align:middle line:90%
So yeah, that's interesting.

00:39:55.235 --> 00:39:57.622 align:middle line:84%
>>LARSON: But then, you can
take it to a spiritual level.

00:39:57.622 --> 00:40:00.080 align:middle line:84%
You can feel like, well, there's
a oneness coming together.

00:40:00.080 --> 00:40:00.885 align:middle line:90%
It's more of a we.

00:40:00.885 --> 00:40:04.320 align:middle line:84%
There's more of that
cosmic consciousness.

00:40:04.320 --> 00:40:06.030 align:middle line:84%
If you believe in
Christ, you could say,

00:40:06.030 --> 00:40:09.600 align:middle line:84%
the Christ consciousness,
so whichever approach

00:40:09.600 --> 00:40:11.850 align:middle line:84%
is meaningful for you,
but you could find that.

00:40:11.850 --> 00:40:13.203 align:middle line:90%
And I think that's really cool.

00:40:13.203 --> 00:40:15.495 align:middle line:84%
And then she had a fun one
with the Jiffy peanut butter

00:40:15.495 --> 00:40:17.260 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:40:17.260 --> 00:40:20.250 align:middle line:84%
That one, I was debating
someone over that one.

00:40:20.250 --> 00:40:21.050 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHS]

00:40:21.050 --> 00:40:21.760 align:middle line:90%
>>LARSON: Really?

00:40:21.760 --> 00:40:22.130 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:40:22.130 --> 00:40:24.090 align:middle line:84%
>>LARSON: Because now,
it's only been Jif.

00:40:24.090 --> 00:40:25.770 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Yeah, no, it
was Jiffy peanut butter.

00:40:25.770 --> 00:40:26.750 align:middle line:90%
>>LARSON: I remember that, too.

00:40:26.750 --> 00:40:26.970 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:40:26.970 --> 00:40:29.460 align:middle line:84%
>>LARSON: But you can ask
how is Jif closer to truth?

00:40:29.460 --> 00:40:31.820 align:middle line:84%
Like, how is that
closer to truth?

00:40:31.820 --> 00:40:34.080 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: OK so that should
be our first question.

00:40:34.080 --> 00:40:37.890 align:middle line:84%
>>LARSON: Yeah, it's a way
to look for the goodness--

00:40:37.890 --> 00:40:40.690 align:middle line:84%
the soul, the spirit
of, what is this?

00:40:40.690 --> 00:40:43.530 align:middle line:84%
And how is it closer to a
revelation of a deeper truth?

00:40:43.530 --> 00:40:46.253 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Back in a
jiff, applies quickly.

00:40:46.253 --> 00:40:47.420 align:middle line:90%
>>LARSON: Yes, jiff is fast.

00:40:47.420 --> 00:40:49.515 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Quickly, jiff is fast.

00:40:49.515 --> 00:40:50.730 align:middle line:90%
It's a fast a little treat.

00:40:50.730 --> 00:40:52.260 align:middle line:90%
OK, ok jiff.

00:40:52.260 --> 00:40:55.710 align:middle line:84%
So what, for you personally in
your life of all these things

00:40:55.710 --> 00:40:57.480 align:middle line:84%
happening and that
you've witnessed,

00:40:57.480 --> 00:41:01.620 align:middle line:84%
not just these ones that we know
of that we can see graphically,

00:41:01.620 --> 00:41:04.260 align:middle line:84%
have been some of the most
profound, in terms of getting

00:41:04.260 --> 00:41:06.240 align:middle line:90%
to that big question?

00:41:06.240 --> 00:41:09.810 align:middle line:84%
>>LARSON: Oh, boy, well, it's
hard to just pick one or two.

00:41:09.810 --> 00:41:10.610 align:middle line:90%
I've had so many.

00:41:10.610 --> 00:41:12.150 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Just pick whichever
ones fly into your mind

00:41:12.150 --> 00:41:12.630 align:middle line:90%
right now.

00:41:12.630 --> 00:41:13.880 align:middle line:90%
>>LARSON: Well, last night--

00:41:13.880 --> 00:41:15.840 align:middle line:90%
just the last 24 hours.

00:41:15.840 --> 00:41:18.510 align:middle line:84%
I met a friend because
I don't see her often,

00:41:18.510 --> 00:41:19.320 align:middle line:90%
but I'm in Boulder.

00:41:19.320 --> 00:41:22.020 align:middle line:84%
And we were talking
about heaven on Earth.

00:41:22.020 --> 00:41:25.470 align:middle line:84%
And I said, well-- it was
such a great conversation.

00:41:25.470 --> 00:41:27.750 align:middle line:84%
So I thought, let's
take a picture together.

00:41:27.750 --> 00:41:28.800 align:middle line:90%
I moved my chair.

00:41:28.800 --> 00:41:32.370 align:middle line:84%
And then, suddenly, out of
nowhere, a rose appeared--

00:41:32.370 --> 00:41:35.890 align:middle line:84%
a little beautiful, real
rose-- not plastic, real,

00:41:35.890 --> 00:41:37.590 align:middle line:84%
with a gentle
fragrance, and it's just

00:41:37.590 --> 00:41:39.270 align:middle line:90%
this beautiful, coral pink.

00:41:39.270 --> 00:41:40.750 align:middle line:90%
It's so cute.

00:41:40.750 --> 00:41:42.690 align:middle line:84%
I said, where did
this come from?

00:41:42.690 --> 00:41:45.240 align:middle line:84%
But we'd been talking
about heaven on Earth.

00:41:45.240 --> 00:41:47.130 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: So this very refined.

00:41:47.130 --> 00:41:48.690 align:middle line:90%
The rose is very refined.

00:41:48.690 --> 00:41:52.020 align:middle line:84%
Its scent is among the most
refined in our physical domain.

00:41:52.020 --> 00:41:54.760 align:middle line:84%
So the beauty of heaven
showed itself as a rose.

00:41:54.760 --> 00:41:55.560 align:middle line:90%
How beautiful.

00:41:55.560 --> 00:41:57.180 align:middle line:90%
>>LARSON: So that just happened.

00:41:57.180 --> 00:42:00.160 align:middle line:90%
But for me, it's like every day.

00:42:00.160 --> 00:42:01.920 align:middle line:84%
I think the everyday
ones matter,

00:42:01.920 --> 00:42:03.925 align:middle line:84%
and that's like
something out of nowhere.

00:42:03.925 --> 00:42:04.800 align:middle line:90%
But people get these.

00:42:04.800 --> 00:42:06.600 align:middle line:90%
And often, they'll dismiss it.

00:42:06.600 --> 00:42:09.450 align:middle line:84%
They'll say, well, that couldn't
have been a rose from nowhere

00:42:09.450 --> 00:42:12.242 align:middle line:90%
and start doubting yourself.

00:42:12.242 --> 00:42:14.200 align:middle line:84%
But I think these things
do happen to everyone.

00:42:14.200 --> 00:42:16.980 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Well, and also,
different outcomes, there

00:42:16.980 --> 00:42:20.190 align:middle line:84%
was one point in there,
it reminded me-- people

00:42:20.190 --> 00:42:21.420 align:middle line:90%
being teleported to safety.

00:42:21.420 --> 00:42:22.220 align:middle line:90%
>>LARSON: Yes.

00:42:22.220 --> 00:42:24.180 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: OK, so I remember--

00:42:24.180 --> 00:42:25.860 align:middle line:84%
well, I kind of
don't remember, I

00:42:25.860 --> 00:42:29.970 align:middle line:84%
was drowning in the
Truckee River, right?

00:42:29.970 --> 00:42:31.380 align:middle line:90%
I knew I was drowning.

00:42:31.380 --> 00:42:34.140 align:middle line:84%
I was trapped under
mossy log, and I

00:42:34.140 --> 00:42:38.070 align:middle line:84%
couldn't get any
traction, and I could see,

00:42:38.070 --> 00:42:41.280 align:middle line:84%
looked like the water,
the surface was only

00:42:41.280 --> 00:42:44.010 align:middle line:84%
a foot or a foot and a half
above me, but I was trapped

00:42:44.010 --> 00:42:45.450 align:middle line:84%
and couldn't move
under this log.

00:42:45.450 --> 00:42:46.617 align:middle line:90%
>>LARSON: That's terrifying.

00:42:46.617 --> 00:42:49.620 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And I thought, to
die when there's the daylight,

00:42:49.620 --> 00:42:51.000 align:middle line:90%
there's the air.

00:42:51.000 --> 00:42:52.830 align:middle line:84%
And I just thought,
what a shame?

00:42:52.830 --> 00:42:55.350 align:middle line:90%
And then everything blacked out.

00:42:55.350 --> 00:42:57.630 align:middle line:84%
And then, I don't
know what happened.

00:42:57.630 --> 00:42:59.850 align:middle line:84%
You could say because
I blacked out,

00:42:59.850 --> 00:43:03.280 align:middle line:90%
my body went limp or something.

00:43:03.280 --> 00:43:06.240 align:middle line:84%
But the point is I was way
down when I came back to,

00:43:06.240 --> 00:43:07.497 align:middle line:90%
way down river.

00:43:07.497 --> 00:43:08.580 align:middle line:90%
And I thought, where am I?

00:43:08.580 --> 00:43:10.320 align:middle line:90%
What happened.

00:43:10.320 --> 00:43:11.250 align:middle line:90%
I should have drowned.

00:43:11.250 --> 00:43:12.660 align:middle line:84%
I've been under water
this whole time.

00:43:12.660 --> 00:43:13.460 align:middle line:90%
>>LARSON: Right.

00:43:13.460 --> 00:43:16.680 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And I popped up
and my partner at the time

00:43:16.680 --> 00:43:19.590 align:middle line:84%
was freaked out, had run
down the river, was looking

00:43:19.590 --> 00:43:20.880 align:middle line:90%
for my body and everything.

00:43:20.880 --> 00:43:21.570 align:middle line:90%
>>LARSON: Oh, my gosh.

00:43:21.570 --> 00:43:22.987 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: But I've
often wondered,

00:43:22.987 --> 00:43:24.848 align:middle line:90%
what actually happened there?

00:43:24.848 --> 00:43:26.640 align:middle line:84%
And other people have
had these experience.

00:43:26.640 --> 00:43:27.830 align:middle line:90%
>>LARSON: Absolutely.

00:43:27.830 --> 00:43:30.750 align:middle line:84%
And a lot of people, I think one
of the most secret confessions

00:43:30.750 --> 00:43:33.270 align:middle line:84%
that people often make to
me after I've given a talk,

00:43:33.270 --> 00:43:35.670 align:middle line:84%
and I've discussed
how sometimes people

00:43:35.670 --> 00:43:37.890 align:middle line:84%
will be facing an
oncoming vehicle,

00:43:37.890 --> 00:43:38.970 align:middle line:90%
there's no way out of it.

00:43:38.970 --> 00:43:39.660 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: No way out.

00:43:39.660 --> 00:43:40.535 align:middle line:90%
>>LARSON: No way out.

00:43:40.535 --> 00:43:42.875 align:middle line:84%
It's an 18 Wheeler, narrow
road, nowhere to go.

00:43:42.875 --> 00:43:44.250 align:middle line:84%
And then, there's
sort of a blip.

00:43:44.250 --> 00:43:47.490 align:middle line:84%
And then the next thing,
they've gone through each other.

00:43:47.490 --> 00:43:49.410 align:middle line:84%
They're on the other
side of each other.

00:43:49.410 --> 00:43:52.393 align:middle line:90%
The truck is behind.

00:43:52.393 --> 00:43:54.060 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: In the
movies, it almost looks

00:43:54.060 --> 00:43:55.760 align:middle line:84%
like kind of a worm
hole or something.

00:43:55.760 --> 00:43:56.040 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:43:56.040 --> 00:43:58.050 align:middle line:84%
>>LARSON: Yeah, but
this actually happened.

00:43:58.050 --> 00:44:00.540 align:middle line:84%
I've given a talk to
maybe 80 or 100 people,

00:44:00.540 --> 00:44:03.090 align:middle line:84%
and then 10% of them will
come to me afterwards

00:44:03.090 --> 00:44:06.873 align:middle line:84%
and privately confess,
this has happened to me.

00:44:06.873 --> 00:44:08.040 align:middle line:90%
I don't want to tell people.

00:44:08.040 --> 00:44:09.540 align:middle line:84%
I've asked, do you
ever tell people?

00:44:09.540 --> 00:44:11.880 align:middle line:84%
And they say, no, people
would think I'm crazy.

00:44:11.880 --> 00:44:13.530 align:middle line:90%
They would say, this isn't real.

00:44:13.530 --> 00:44:15.540 align:middle line:84%
But if you look at
quantum physics,

00:44:15.540 --> 00:44:18.360 align:middle line:84%
we can see quantum
tunneling and quantum

00:44:18.360 --> 00:44:20.490 align:middle line:90%
teleportation are very real.

00:44:20.490 --> 00:44:23.820 align:middle line:84%
And increasingly, we're moving
bigger and bigger objects

00:44:23.820 --> 00:44:27.600 align:middle line:84%
through because people are
seeking quantum computing

00:44:27.600 --> 00:44:29.190 align:middle line:90%
and the technology of it.

00:44:29.190 --> 00:44:32.790 align:middle line:84%
So we're proving that a lot
of this larger-scale activity

00:44:32.790 --> 00:44:33.960 align:middle line:90%
can occur.

00:44:33.960 --> 00:44:37.450 align:middle line:84%
It's no longer, like,
garbage, or silly, or woo-woo.

00:44:37.450 --> 00:44:39.008 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:44:39.008 --> 00:44:40.800 align:middle line:84%
OK, well, I mean,
there's several questions

00:44:40.800 --> 00:44:43.560 align:middle line:84%
I can ask from there,
but one of them

00:44:43.560 --> 00:44:47.640 align:middle line:84%
is, as we're moving
toward what are considered

00:44:47.640 --> 00:44:52.380 align:middle line:84%
artificial means of
intelligence, AI,

00:44:52.380 --> 00:44:57.210 align:middle line:84%
and we have all this power
and magnetism collectively

00:44:57.210 --> 00:45:01.320 align:middle line:84%
and individually to our
own self-generated desires,

00:45:01.320 --> 00:45:06.250 align:middle line:84%
and love, and thoughts,
how, in your mind,

00:45:06.250 --> 00:45:11.845 align:middle line:84%
does that spill over into or
affect the development of AI?

00:45:11.845 --> 00:45:14.080 align:middle line:84%
>>LARSON: This is such
an exciting time for AI

00:45:14.080 --> 00:45:15.152 align:middle line:90%
because they have--

00:45:15.152 --> 00:45:16.360 align:middle line:90%
they are reaching that point.

00:45:16.360 --> 00:45:19.540 align:middle line:84%
They've gone through several
levels of development.

00:45:19.540 --> 00:45:20.800 align:middle line:90%
And we're seeing some of it.

00:45:20.800 --> 00:45:23.680 align:middle line:84%
We're seeing facial recognition,
and pattern recognition,

00:45:23.680 --> 00:45:25.000 align:middle line:90%
and, now, deep learning.

00:45:25.000 --> 00:45:29.800 align:middle line:84%
So we've we're going into phase
3 of artificial intelligence.

00:45:29.800 --> 00:45:35.560 align:middle line:84%
In 2015, some robots passed
the self-awareness test.

00:45:35.560 --> 00:45:37.965 align:middle line:90%
They can actually tell--

00:45:37.965 --> 00:45:40.150 align:middle line:84%
they're doing that
reflective cognition trick

00:45:40.150 --> 00:45:42.560 align:middle line:84%
of knowing that they're
aware of awareness.

00:45:42.560 --> 00:45:45.980 align:middle line:84%
So I think the best way
forward is to be aware

00:45:45.980 --> 00:45:47.230 align:middle line:90%
that we can partner with this.

00:45:47.230 --> 00:45:50.680 align:middle line:84%
We can keep envisioning
a positive future that's

00:45:50.680 --> 00:45:54.370 align:middle line:84%
the key is, keep
open minded and keep

00:45:54.370 --> 00:45:56.800 align:middle line:84%
asking, how good can
this get and really

00:45:56.800 --> 00:45:58.045 align:middle line:90%
stay focused on that.

00:45:58.045 --> 00:45:59.170 align:middle line:90%
Because humans, otherwise--

00:45:59.170 --> 00:46:00.910 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Because
otherwise, it's scary.

00:46:00.910 --> 00:46:02.560 align:middle line:84%
Because people feel
that we're going

00:46:02.560 --> 00:46:07.520 align:middle line:84%
to be somehow replaced and
merged with silicone and that's

00:46:07.520 --> 00:46:08.320 align:middle line:90%
it.

00:46:08.320 --> 00:46:09.940 align:middle line:90%
>>LARSON: That's not necessary.

00:46:09.940 --> 00:46:11.980 align:middle line:84%
I don't see that as
what I would like to do.

00:46:11.980 --> 00:46:14.050 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: No, I don't see that
as what I'd like to do, either,

00:46:14.050 --> 00:46:14.850 align:middle line:90%
but some--

00:46:14.850 --> 00:46:18.040 align:middle line:84%
I think people, and
even can certain groups

00:46:18.040 --> 00:46:23.230 align:middle line:84%
of conspiracy theory are
aligning around this notion

00:46:23.230 --> 00:46:25.120 align:middle line:84%
that it's going to
take over humanity,

00:46:25.120 --> 00:46:26.800 align:middle line:90%
and we will exist no more.

00:46:26.800 --> 00:46:27.910 align:middle line:90%
I don't see that.

00:46:27.910 --> 00:46:30.530 align:middle line:84%
There are some
fundamental differences,

00:46:30.530 --> 00:46:33.470 align:middle line:84%
just when you start looking at
the notion of soul embodying

00:46:33.470 --> 00:46:34.270 align:middle line:90%
flesh.

00:46:34.270 --> 00:46:35.070 align:middle line:90%
>>LARSON: Right.

00:46:35.070 --> 00:46:36.280 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Now what is that?

00:46:36.280 --> 00:46:37.822 align:middle line:84%
That's a whole
different opportunity.

00:46:37.822 --> 00:46:40.140 align:middle line:84%
>>LARSON: It is a
different opportunity.

00:46:40.140 --> 00:46:42.160 align:middle line:84%
And I think we could
go to dark places.

00:46:42.160 --> 00:46:44.350 align:middle line:84%
I think, personally,
I feel like I've

00:46:44.350 --> 00:46:47.650 align:middle line:84%
checked out what that future
could look like if AI ran

00:46:47.650 --> 00:46:49.530 align:middle line:90%
the world, and that's not good.

00:46:49.530 --> 00:46:51.220 align:middle line:90%
I would say, let's not go there.

00:46:51.220 --> 00:46:53.470 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Let's not give
that any of our-- put

00:46:53.470 --> 00:46:55.328 align:middle line:84%
more thought forms
and emotion into it.

00:46:55.328 --> 00:46:56.620 align:middle line:90%
>>LARSON: You can say no to it.

00:46:56.620 --> 00:46:58.720 align:middle line:84%
We can all collectively
say no to that,

00:46:58.720 --> 00:47:01.170 align:middle line:84%
but yes to a
partnership with AI.

00:47:01.170 --> 00:47:03.190 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: With what
it can do right

00:47:03.190 --> 00:47:05.395 align:middle line:84%
in service of our own
growth, and advancement,

00:47:05.395 --> 00:47:06.845 align:middle line:90%

>>REGINA: Yes.

00:47:08.980 --> 00:47:11.080 align:middle line:84%
And so that's really
the thought form, to me,

00:47:11.080 --> 00:47:14.710 align:middle line:90%
it seems is most important.

00:47:14.710 --> 00:47:16.780 align:middle line:90%
It is being developed.

00:47:16.780 --> 00:47:20.500 align:middle line:84%
How can we do it with ethics,
with integrity, and so

00:47:20.500 --> 00:47:22.510 align:middle line:90%
that it serves organic life?

00:47:22.510 --> 00:47:23.860 align:middle line:90%
>>LARSON: Yes.

00:47:23.860 --> 00:47:24.690 align:middle line:90%
All of us.

00:47:24.690 --> 00:47:26.260 align:middle line:84%
So it serves the best
for all concerned.

00:47:26.260 --> 00:47:26.845 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: For all concerned.

00:47:26.845 --> 00:47:27.610 align:middle line:90%
>>LARSON: Yes.

00:47:27.610 --> 00:47:28.180 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:47:28.180 --> 00:47:29.638 align:middle line:84%
>>LARSON: Those
are good questions,

00:47:29.638 --> 00:47:31.900 align:middle line:84%
and that creates a
guiding opportunity

00:47:31.900 --> 00:47:36.610 align:middle line:84%
because the questions create
the reality that we experience.

00:47:36.610 --> 00:47:39.070 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: I mean, if
we are collectively

00:47:39.070 --> 00:47:42.160 align:middle line:84%
creating these shifts
in parallel realities

00:47:42.160 --> 00:47:45.190 align:middle line:84%
as these parallel realities
are creating shifts

00:47:45.190 --> 00:47:48.130 align:middle line:84%
in our own perception, and
timelines, and so forth,

00:47:48.130 --> 00:47:51.910 align:middle line:84%
and if artificial intelligence
is developing self-awareness,

00:47:51.910 --> 00:47:54.550 align:middle line:84%
at what point does that
original thought come in?

00:47:54.550 --> 00:47:56.440 align:middle line:84%
And does the creation
process start?

00:47:56.440 --> 00:47:57.940 align:middle line:84%
>>LARSON: Those
are good questions.

00:47:57.940 --> 00:47:59.500 align:middle line:90%
And, again, I can't really say.

00:47:59.500 --> 00:48:02.110 align:middle line:84%
I think even the researchers,
I've talked to some of them.

00:48:02.110 --> 00:48:03.760 align:middle line:90%
They don't know.

00:48:03.760 --> 00:48:06.800 align:middle line:84%
So we're in a very strange
new world right now.

00:48:06.800 --> 00:48:07.600 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: We are.

00:48:07.600 --> 00:48:09.142 align:middle line:84%
So we're just putting
that out there,

00:48:09.142 --> 00:48:12.380 align:middle line:84%
that put that love around it,
put that desire for ethics,

00:48:12.380 --> 00:48:14.830 align:middle line:84%
so we can work in partnership
around it, instead of just

00:48:14.830 --> 00:48:17.890 align:middle line:84%
saying, no, you can't advance
us on this scientific level

00:48:17.890 --> 00:48:20.050 align:middle line:84%
because, technologically,
it is moving on.

00:48:20.050 --> 00:48:21.160 align:middle line:84%
>>LARSON: It's like
cell phones are here.

00:48:21.160 --> 00:48:22.600 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Cell phones
are here, yeah, exactly.

00:48:22.600 --> 00:48:24.000 align:middle line:90%
For good or for bad, right?

00:48:24.000 --> 00:48:25.660 align:middle line:84%
>>LARSON: Ideally,
we would use them,

00:48:25.660 --> 00:48:27.285 align:middle line:84%
and we wouldn't let
them run our lives.

00:48:27.285 --> 00:48:28.900 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Exactly, exactly.

00:48:28.900 --> 00:48:33.100 align:middle line:84%
So now, let's go back
again to your thoughts

00:48:33.100 --> 00:48:37.510 align:middle line:84%
on the most incredibly
juicy, interesting frontier

00:48:37.510 --> 00:48:40.990 align:middle line:84%
of the notion of these
parallel realities.

00:48:40.990 --> 00:48:43.450 align:middle line:84%
>>LARSON: Well, I think
the big news in 2019

00:48:43.450 --> 00:48:45.430 align:middle line:84%
had to do with
recognizing that we

00:48:45.430 --> 00:48:47.870 align:middle line:90%
don't have objective reality.

00:48:47.870 --> 00:48:48.820 align:middle line:90%
There isn't just one--

00:48:48.820 --> 00:48:49.510 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: No such thing.

00:48:49.510 --> 00:48:50.500 align:middle line:90%
>>LARSON: There's no such thing.

00:48:50.500 --> 00:48:51.460 align:middle line:90%
This is a big idea.

00:48:51.460 --> 00:48:52.810 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: This is very big.

00:48:52.810 --> 00:48:54.090 align:middle line:84%
And this is from the
world of science.

00:48:54.090 --> 00:48:54.890 align:middle line:90%
>>LARSON: It is.

00:48:54.890 --> 00:48:56.910 align:middle line:90%
There is no objective reality.

00:48:56.910 --> 00:48:59.207 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: It's like, [GNAWING].

00:48:59.207 --> 00:49:01.540 align:middle line:84%
And then we're still trying
to win arguments and debates

00:49:01.540 --> 00:49:03.430 align:middle line:84%
with each other
over what happened.

00:49:03.430 --> 00:49:07.225 align:middle line:84%
And now, it's being validated,
there's no objective reality.

00:49:07.225 --> 00:49:09.520 align:middle line:90%
>>LARSON: That's right.

00:49:09.520 --> 00:49:11.110 align:middle line:90%
It could be scary for people.

00:49:11.110 --> 00:49:12.235 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Could be freeing.

00:49:12.235 --> 00:49:14.290 align:middle line:84%
>>LARSON: It could
be very freeing, yes.

00:49:14.290 --> 00:49:16.750 align:middle line:84%
And so the idea
came from the work

00:49:16.750 --> 00:49:19.510 align:middle line:84%
at the University of
Heriot-Watt in Edinburgh

00:49:19.510 --> 00:49:22.750 align:middle line:84%
and also University
of Vienna Austria.

00:49:22.750 --> 00:49:24.400 align:middle line:84%
And what they did is
they did a version

00:49:24.400 --> 00:49:26.320 align:middle line:84%
of the double-slit
experiment, which

00:49:26.320 --> 00:49:27.100 align:middle line:90%
I think people have seen that.

00:49:27.100 --> 00:49:28.030 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: [? Strategy, ?] yeah.

00:49:28.030 --> 00:49:29.905 align:middle line:84%
>>LARSON: Yeah, and then
it was two observers

00:49:29.905 --> 00:49:34.180 align:middle line:84%
at that same place, same time,
trusted observational devices

00:49:34.180 --> 00:49:37.810 align:middle line:84%
that came up with two very
different observations

00:49:37.810 --> 00:49:41.390 align:middle line:84%
of the experiment at that
same place and same time.

00:49:41.390 --> 00:49:42.190 align:middle line:90%
So there we go.

00:49:42.190 --> 00:49:42.310 align:middle line:90%
That's--

00:49:42.310 --> 00:49:42.835 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Proof.

00:49:42.835 --> 00:49:44.960 align:middle line:84%
>>LARSON: That's the proof
that we're talking about

00:49:44.960 --> 00:49:48.130 align:middle line:84%
that we are not living
in objective reality,

00:49:48.130 --> 00:49:50.710 align:middle line:84%
where there's only
one thing happening.

00:49:50.710 --> 00:49:54.310 align:middle line:84%
Now this whole conversation has
been about that, so we already

00:49:54.310 --> 00:49:57.460 align:middle line:84%
know that, you and I.
And now, we're saying,

00:49:57.460 --> 00:50:00.070 align:middle line:84%
this is now becoming
scientific fact.

00:50:00.070 --> 00:50:01.600 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So then
it gets back to,

00:50:01.600 --> 00:50:05.590 align:middle line:84%
what is our love, our joy, our
passion, and our preference?

00:50:05.590 --> 00:50:08.700 align:middle line:84%
If we're not living in
an objective reality,

00:50:08.700 --> 00:50:10.465 align:middle line:90%
then how good can it get?

00:50:10.465 --> 00:50:12.340 align:middle line:84%
And that's what you
always say, which I love.

00:50:12.340 --> 00:50:14.820 align:middle line:84%
I love that about you,
how good can it get?

00:50:14.820 --> 00:50:16.620 align:middle line:90%
And that should be our question.

00:50:16.620 --> 00:50:18.960 align:middle line:84%
Because we're not a
slave to anyone else's

00:50:18.960 --> 00:50:20.490 align:middle line:90%
perception of anything.

00:50:20.490 --> 00:50:23.610 align:middle line:84%
Even though we may have a shared
common experience here today,

00:50:23.610 --> 00:50:25.830 align:middle line:84%
for all we know, by the
time this is edited,

00:50:25.830 --> 00:50:27.180 align:middle line:90%
it won't be this at all.

00:50:27.180 --> 00:50:28.320 align:middle line:90%
We just don't know, right?

00:50:28.320 --> 00:50:30.240 align:middle line:90%
>>LARSON: [LAUGHS] Right.

00:50:30.240 --> 00:50:32.490 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: The best
a human being can do

00:50:32.490 --> 00:50:36.000 align:middle line:84%
is to intend for the
very highest outcome

00:50:36.000 --> 00:50:37.710 align:middle line:90%
and fuse it with love.

00:50:37.710 --> 00:50:41.080 align:middle line:84%
>>LARSON: With integrity, with
that ethics and integrity.

00:50:41.080 --> 00:50:43.030 align:middle line:84%
And those words
are not used much.

00:50:43.030 --> 00:50:43.980 align:middle line:90%
They used to be.

00:50:43.980 --> 00:50:45.000 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Oh, my god.

00:50:45.000 --> 00:50:45.800 align:middle line:90%
Thank you.

00:50:45.800 --> 00:50:48.240 align:middle line:84%
Because that's really where
I'm at on all of this, is,

00:50:48.240 --> 00:50:49.755 align:middle line:90%
people are so confused.

00:50:49.755 --> 00:50:50.880 align:middle line:90%
How do we know what's true?

00:50:50.880 --> 00:50:54.420 align:middle line:84%
Because right now, our
country is in tatters,

00:50:54.420 --> 00:50:56.370 align:middle line:84%
and people are fighting
with each other,

00:50:56.370 --> 00:50:59.020 align:middle line:84%
and everyone's saying, yeah, but
I just don't know what's true.

00:50:59.020 --> 00:51:01.030 align:middle line:90%
I don't know who to believe.

00:51:01.030 --> 00:51:03.220 align:middle line:84%
This is a really big
moment in history.

00:51:03.220 --> 00:51:04.470 align:middle line:90%
I don't know what to believe.

00:51:04.470 --> 00:51:08.310 align:middle line:84%
Because there is
misinformation, intentional

00:51:08.310 --> 00:51:11.460 align:middle line:84%
disinformation as
well that we're all

00:51:11.460 --> 00:51:14.562 align:middle line:84%
trying to contend with and
being bombarded with data.

00:51:14.562 --> 00:51:16.770 align:middle line:84%
>>LARSON: And literal
different subjective realities.

00:51:16.770 --> 00:51:18.570 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And different
subjective realities.

00:51:18.570 --> 00:51:19.653 align:middle line:90%
>>LARSON: Which is a fact.

00:51:19.653 --> 00:51:22.110 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So in a
situation like this,

00:51:22.110 --> 00:51:24.510 align:middle line:84%
my feeling is, you've
got to find your way back

00:51:24.510 --> 00:51:31.170 align:middle line:84%
to your heart and your
own system of ethics.

00:51:31.170 --> 00:51:33.510 align:middle line:84%
And that has a kind of morality,
not a preachy morality,

00:51:33.510 --> 00:51:35.610 align:middle line:84%
but it has to do
with what's generated

00:51:35.610 --> 00:51:40.325 align:middle line:84%
from the heart in terms of what
truly is beneficial versus not.

00:51:40.325 --> 00:51:42.450 align:middle line:84%
>>LARSON: And I think we
know that on a deep level.

00:51:42.450 --> 00:51:45.210 align:middle line:84%
We know that, to live a good
life, you can trust your heart.

00:51:45.210 --> 00:51:48.450 align:middle line:84%
You can trust just doing
things that are good,

00:51:48.450 --> 00:51:51.660 align:middle line:84%
right where you are, in
your home, with your family,

00:51:51.660 --> 00:51:53.950 align:middle line:84%
caring for others
that are close to you,

00:51:53.950 --> 00:51:56.058 align:middle line:90%
and just being a good person.

00:51:56.058 --> 00:51:58.350 align:middle line:84%
And people, I think, sometimes
if you look at the news,

00:51:58.350 --> 00:52:00.600 align:middle line:84%
you might feel like, what
difference does it make?

00:52:00.600 --> 00:52:02.640 align:middle line:90%
How can that change the world?

00:52:02.640 --> 00:52:04.800 align:middle line:90%
Absolutely, it can, and it does.

00:52:04.800 --> 00:52:07.180 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Absolutely,
I agree with you 100%.

00:52:07.180 --> 00:52:09.120 align:middle line:84%
And while all the
craziness is going on,

00:52:09.120 --> 00:52:11.100 align:middle line:84%
I just keep saying
to people that--

00:52:11.100 --> 00:52:14.280 align:middle line:84%
I talk to people on all
sides of all these issues.

00:52:14.280 --> 00:52:17.340 align:middle line:84%
And I say, yeah, but if
you just go back to--

00:52:17.340 --> 00:52:19.350 align:middle line:84%
look at life through
the lens of what

00:52:19.350 --> 00:52:21.990 align:middle line:84%
feels like it's right
to you, what's good,

00:52:21.990 --> 00:52:24.323 align:middle line:90%
goodness, does this measure up?

00:52:24.323 --> 00:52:26.240 align:middle line:84%
If it doesn't measure
up, there's your answer.

00:52:26.240 --> 00:52:28.615 align:middle line:84%
And I know you're hearing all
different stories about it,

00:52:28.615 --> 00:52:31.410 align:middle line:84%
but if-- unfeeling
levels measuring up,

00:52:31.410 --> 00:52:33.490 align:middle line:84%
that's your starting
place to find truth again.

00:52:33.490 --> 00:52:34.290 align:middle line:90%
>>LARSON: Right.

00:52:34.290 --> 00:52:35.260 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: It starts here.

00:52:35.260 --> 00:52:36.270 align:middle line:84%
>>LARSON: And if it
doesn't feel right,

00:52:36.270 --> 00:52:37.830 align:middle line:84%
remember that you
can change the way

00:52:37.830 --> 00:52:38.820 align:middle line:90%
that you're paying attention.

00:52:38.820 --> 00:52:39.722 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Exactly.

00:52:39.722 --> 00:52:42.167 align:middle line:84%
>>LARSON: You can just
take a deep breath--

00:52:42.167 --> 00:52:44.250 align:middle line:84%
something I'll do is just
feel like, OK, these are

00:52:44.250 --> 00:52:45.750 align:middle line:90%
probable realities around me.

00:52:45.750 --> 00:52:47.490 align:middle line:84%
I'm just going to
kind of role it a bit,

00:52:47.490 --> 00:52:49.910 align:middle line:84%
like you're scrolling through
your cell phone, just kind of,

00:52:49.910 --> 00:52:51.090 align:middle line:84%
I'm going to scroll
through this.

00:52:51.090 --> 00:52:51.960 align:middle line:90%
Oh, there we go.

00:52:51.960 --> 00:52:52.950 align:middle line:90%
This feels much better.

00:52:52.950 --> 00:52:54.930 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Yeah, I
mean, and people

00:52:54.930 --> 00:52:58.140 align:middle line:84%
could say, wow, what an
interesting person Cynthia is,

00:52:58.140 --> 00:53:00.300 align:middle line:90%
and you are.

00:53:00.300 --> 00:53:02.550 align:middle line:84%
But also, you
practice what you know

00:53:02.550 --> 00:53:06.860 align:middle line:84%
to be true because you
came in still integrated,

00:53:06.860 --> 00:53:08.620 align:middle line:84%
where most of us
were disintegrated.

00:53:08.620 --> 00:53:11.810 align:middle line:84%
>>LARSON: And then, I got
inculturated or whatever

00:53:11.810 --> 00:53:12.655 align:middle line:90%
with our society.

00:53:12.655 --> 00:53:14.280 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Right, but
you didn't forget.

00:53:14.280 --> 00:53:17.940 align:middle line:84%
So you actually know how
these basic mechanics

00:53:17.940 --> 00:53:20.880 align:middle line:84%
work from those higher
extraordinary levels.

00:53:20.880 --> 00:53:22.830 align:middle line:84%
You actually know
of what you speak.

00:53:22.830 --> 00:53:24.937 align:middle line:84%
>>LARSON: But this is
something we can all do.

00:53:24.937 --> 00:53:26.520 align:middle line:10%
When you walk down
the hall and you're

00:53:26.520 --> 00:53:28.290 align:middle line:10%
trying to find something,
and it's almost

00:53:28.290 --> 00:53:30.870 align:middle line:10%
like you went through a vortex
or a portal, and you're like,

00:53:30.870 --> 00:53:31.670 align:middle line:10%
what happened?

00:53:31.670 --> 00:53:33.930 align:middle line:10%
And then you come back,
like, what was I looking for?

00:53:33.930 --> 00:53:34.920 align:middle line:90%
Well, you can use that.

00:53:34.920 --> 00:53:37.730 align:middle line:84%
You can use this experience
of going down the hall.

00:53:37.730 --> 00:53:40.230 align:middle line:84%
Like, if you don't know what I
mean about scrolling through,

00:53:40.230 --> 00:53:41.050 align:middle line:90%
that's OK.

00:53:41.050 --> 00:53:43.230 align:middle line:84%
We all know what it feels
like when you go down the hall

00:53:43.230 --> 00:53:44.880 align:middle line:84%
to get something,
and you can't quite

00:53:44.880 --> 00:53:46.620 align:middle line:90%
remember what you were doing.

00:53:46.620 --> 00:53:48.570 align:middle line:84%
Play with that,
because that's perfect.

00:53:48.570 --> 00:53:50.490 align:middle line:84%
Just imagine, like,
whatever the situation is

00:53:50.490 --> 00:53:53.600 align:middle line:84%
you want to change, I'm going
to walk down the hall with it,

00:53:53.600 --> 00:53:55.350 align:middle line:84%
and I'm going to come
back, and it's going

00:53:55.350 --> 00:53:56.820 align:middle line:90%
to be a different reality.

00:53:56.820 --> 00:53:58.950 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Yeah, and
oftentimes it is.

00:53:58.950 --> 00:54:01.620 align:middle line:84%
And oftentimes, the information
blips right back in anyway.

00:54:01.620 --> 00:54:02.260 align:middle line:90%
>>LARSON: That's right.

00:54:02.260 --> 00:54:02.730 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: It changes.

00:54:02.730 --> 00:54:03.688 align:middle line:90%
>>LARSON: That's right.

00:54:03.688 --> 00:54:06.840 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So I mean, to me, the
beauty of conversing with you

00:54:06.840 --> 00:54:08.215 align:middle line:90%
over this is not just--

00:54:08.215 --> 00:54:10.340 align:middle line:84%
I mean, I wanted you to
get to the mechanics of it,

00:54:10.340 --> 00:54:11.340 align:middle line:90%
and that's really good.

00:54:11.340 --> 00:54:12.930 align:middle line:90%
I'm glad we did that.

00:54:12.930 --> 00:54:15.180 align:middle line:84%
But our participation
and responsibility

00:54:15.180 --> 00:54:18.660 align:middle line:84%
within it, everything
we're seeing around us,

00:54:18.660 --> 00:54:20.820 align:middle line:84%
whether it's by default
or not or whether it's

00:54:20.820 --> 00:54:22.890 align:middle line:84%
by old programming
and old beliefs,

00:54:22.890 --> 00:54:25.890 align:middle line:84%
we're just seeing extensions and
fragments of our own thoughts

00:54:25.890 --> 00:54:28.382 align:middle line:84%
out there, playing out
and reflected back to us.

00:54:28.382 --> 00:54:29.340 align:middle line:90%
>>LARSON: That's right.

00:54:29.340 --> 00:54:30.715 align:middle line:84%
And it's hard to
see it sometimes

00:54:30.715 --> 00:54:33.930 align:middle line:84%
because it's easy to fall
back into, they did this to me

00:54:33.930 --> 00:54:37.350 align:middle line:90%
or, they did this to us.

00:54:37.350 --> 00:54:39.570 align:middle line:84%
It starts from
inside, you're right.

00:54:39.570 --> 00:54:43.230 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And to keep
that love, and enthusiasm,

00:54:43.230 --> 00:54:46.170 align:middle line:84%
and that choice, that
choice toward a higher,

00:54:46.170 --> 00:54:48.723 align:middle line:84%
and the highest, and the
best outcome for all.

00:54:48.723 --> 00:54:50.140 align:middle line:84%
Because some people
would say, oh,

00:54:50.140 --> 00:54:56.730 align:middle line:84%
she's a dreamer, or an idealist,
and all these different things

00:54:56.730 --> 00:54:59.443 align:middle line:84%
in a harsh, cold world that
we're in today, where you gotta

00:54:59.443 --> 00:55:01.860 align:middle line:84%
be pragmatic, and you have to
do your deals with the devil

00:55:01.860 --> 00:55:02.790 align:middle line:90%
sometimes.

00:55:02.790 --> 00:55:03.960 align:middle line:90%
I say not.

00:55:03.960 --> 00:55:06.120 align:middle line:84%
You do not have to do
your deals with the devil.

00:55:06.120 --> 00:55:06.953 align:middle line:90%
>>LARSON: Thank you.

00:55:06.953 --> 00:55:07.910 align:middle line:90%
I love that about you.

00:55:07.910 --> 00:55:09.300 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Well, I
love that about you.

00:55:09.300 --> 00:55:10.100 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHTER]

00:55:10.100 --> 00:55:11.790 align:middle line:84%
I think that's why
we get on well.

00:55:11.790 --> 00:55:13.770 align:middle line:84%
But we do not have to
do deals with the devil.

00:55:13.770 --> 00:55:14.400 align:middle line:90%
>>LARSON: No, you don't.

00:55:14.400 --> 00:55:15.200 align:middle line:90%
You don't.

00:55:15.200 --> 00:55:16.800 align:middle line:90%
You absolutely do not.

00:55:16.800 --> 00:55:19.320 align:middle line:84%
I think that's the key, when
you recognize, you can do

00:55:19.320 --> 00:55:20.833 align:middle line:90%
your own thing, like you did.

00:55:20.833 --> 00:55:22.750 align:middle line:84%
And you write about it
in your wonderful book.

00:55:22.750 --> 00:55:23.220 align:middle line:90%
I love that.

00:55:23.220 --> 00:55:23.665 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHTER]

00:55:23.665 --> 00:55:24.555 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Thank you.

00:55:24.555 --> 00:55:25.530 align:middle line:84%
>>LARSON: Thank
goodness for that.

00:55:25.530 --> 00:55:27.330 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Most people don't know
I even wrote one, but it is.

00:55:27.330 --> 00:55:28.365 align:middle line:90%
It's just my experience--

00:55:28.365 --> 00:55:29.490 align:middle line:90%
>>LARSON: Ah, it's awesome.

00:55:29.490 --> 00:55:32.430 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: --of what it's like
to go through and pick up

00:55:32.430 --> 00:55:34.007 align:middle line:84%
on the opportunities
life presents.

00:55:34.007 --> 00:55:35.590 align:middle line:84%
Even if they're
awkward in the moment,

00:55:35.590 --> 00:55:37.440 align:middle line:84%
even if they're
uncomfortable, if you just

00:55:37.440 --> 00:55:41.170 align:middle line:84%
say yes to that voice,
that goodness in yourself,

00:55:41.170 --> 00:55:42.355 align:middle line:90%
amazing things happen.

00:55:42.355 --> 00:55:45.470 align:middle line:84%
And that's why I wrote the
book was just for fun, really.

00:55:45.470 --> 00:55:46.270 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHTER]

00:55:46.270 --> 00:55:48.450 align:middle line:84%
>>LARSON: But it's a
perfect example of,

00:55:48.450 --> 00:55:51.240 align:middle line:84%
you can walk away from things if
they feel like that's not right

00:55:51.240 --> 00:55:53.790 align:middle line:84%
and you can feel that something
better is coming, even if you

00:55:53.790 --> 00:55:55.740 align:middle line:90%
don't know what it is.

00:55:55.740 --> 00:55:56.700 align:middle line:90%
That's often true.

00:55:56.700 --> 00:55:58.950 align:middle line:84%
Like, when you ask that
question, how good can it get,

00:55:58.950 --> 00:56:01.680 align:middle line:84%
I find that I'll get things
I needed that I didn't even

00:56:01.680 --> 00:56:02.480 align:middle line:90%
know I needed.

00:56:02.480 --> 00:56:02.730 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Didn't know.

00:56:02.730 --> 00:56:04.438 align:middle line:84%
That's the thing,
listening to that part,

00:56:04.438 --> 00:56:06.360 align:middle line:84%
listening to this
multidimensional voice

00:56:06.360 --> 00:56:09.450 align:middle line:84%
inside us, there's nothing
wrong with a conscious mind

00:56:09.450 --> 00:56:12.450 align:middle line:84%
to keep us from running out
in front of a car, you know?

00:56:12.450 --> 00:56:15.280 align:middle line:84%
We need every part of our
mind to work together,

00:56:15.280 --> 00:56:18.790 align:middle line:84%
but we can't have the more
fundamental dense part running

00:56:18.790 --> 00:56:19.590 align:middle line:90%
the whole show.

00:56:19.590 --> 00:56:22.020 align:middle line:84%
>>LARSON: There is a
greater consciousness,

00:56:22.020 --> 00:56:23.490 align:middle line:90%
and we all have access to it.

00:56:23.490 --> 00:56:25.020 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: We do indeed.

00:56:25.020 --> 00:56:27.282 align:middle line:84%
It's been absolutely
wonderful sitting with you.

00:56:27.282 --> 00:56:28.740 align:middle line:84%
I just love being
in your presence.

00:56:28.740 --> 00:56:29.907 align:middle line:90%
There's so much light there.

00:56:29.907 --> 00:56:31.740 align:middle line:84%
And thank you for sharing
this from a higher

00:56:31.740 --> 00:56:33.630 align:middle line:84%
perspective of someone
who didn't forget,

00:56:33.630 --> 00:56:35.220 align:middle line:90%
who never disintegrated.
