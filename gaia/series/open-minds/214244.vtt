>>REGINA MEREDITH:
If we're existing

00:00:20.530 --> 00:00:23.650 align:middle line:10%
in a construct of parallel
realities, then what does it

00:00:23.650 --> 00:00:26.630 align:middle line:10%
take to construct one that
will work better for us?

00:00:26.630 --> 00:00:28.510 align:middle line:10%
This conversation
with Darryl Anka

00:00:28.510 --> 00:00:30.550 align:middle line:10%
is going to take
us through this,

00:00:30.550 --> 00:00:32.920 align:middle line:10%
the explanation for
the Mandela effect

00:00:32.920 --> 00:00:35.090 align:middle line:10%
and our co-created future.

00:00:35.090 --> 00:00:36.770 align:middle line:84%
So let's not waste
another moment.

00:00:36.770 --> 00:00:39.410 align:middle line:84%
I'm just so happy to meet you
after all these years, Darryl.

00:00:39.410 --> 00:00:40.050 align:middle line:84%
>>DARRYL ANKA:
Thank you so much.

00:00:40.050 --> 00:00:41.000 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: We've
never sat together.

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:43.112 align:middle line:84%
I don't know how that
hasn't worked until now.

00:00:43.112 --> 00:00:44.570 align:middle line:84%
>>ANKA: This is
the perfect timing.

00:00:44.570 --> 00:00:45.903 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: It's a perfect timing.

00:00:45.903 --> 00:00:50.330 align:middle line:84%
So first of all, it used to
be that five, 10 years ago,

00:00:50.330 --> 00:00:52.630 align:middle line:84%
the notion and discussion
of parallel realities

00:00:52.630 --> 00:00:56.670 align:middle line:84%
was for sci-fi junkies and
esotericists of the extreme.

00:00:56.670 --> 00:00:58.660 align:middle line:90%
That's not the case anymore.

00:00:58.660 --> 00:01:02.420 align:middle line:84%
"Popular Mechanics" magazine
is shocking these days.

00:01:02.420 --> 00:01:04.129 align:middle line:90%
They talk about consciousness.

00:01:04.129 --> 00:01:06.940 align:middle line:84%
So it's made it to
mainstream, but still, people

00:01:06.940 --> 00:01:08.400 align:middle line:90%
don't understand it.

00:01:08.400 --> 00:01:09.200 align:middle line:90%
>>ANKA: Yeah.

00:01:09.200 --> 00:01:11.960 align:middle line:10%
It hasn't really spread
out in the general public.

00:01:11.960 --> 00:01:14.840 align:middle line:10%
They have an idea of
what that concept means,

00:01:14.840 --> 00:01:17.650 align:middle line:10%
but they don't understand
how integrated that actually

00:01:17.650 --> 00:01:19.610 align:middle line:10%
is into our daily experience.

00:01:19.610 --> 00:01:21.820 align:middle line:84%
And it doesn't always
mean that they have to,

00:01:21.820 --> 00:01:24.640 align:middle line:84%
but it's always kind of
helpful to understand

00:01:24.640 --> 00:01:27.140 align:middle line:84%
how these things work if
you want to take it further,

00:01:27.140 --> 00:01:29.180 align:middle line:84%
if you want to expand
your consciousness,

00:01:29.180 --> 00:01:31.390 align:middle line:84%
if you have any
interest at all in going

00:01:31.390 --> 00:01:34.990 align:middle line:84%
into any spiritual
investigation or just

00:01:34.990 --> 00:01:38.440 align:middle line:84%
an understanding of the cosmos
in general and how things work.

00:01:38.440 --> 00:01:40.690 align:middle line:84%
Parallel realities
will usually come up

00:01:40.690 --> 00:01:43.160 align:middle line:84%
at some point in
their investigation.

00:01:43.160 --> 00:01:46.330 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So if you can explain
to everyone right now why

00:01:46.330 --> 00:01:49.430 align:middle line:84%
it's actually important
that humanity start getting

00:01:49.430 --> 00:01:53.270 align:middle line:84%
on the page of understanding
that they are multi-dimensional

00:01:53.270 --> 00:01:56.180 align:middle line:84%
and that they are
constantly co-creating

00:01:56.180 --> 00:01:59.390 align:middle line:84%
parallel realities, the
implications of this

00:01:59.390 --> 00:02:01.598 align:middle line:84%
and why we have to know,
that we've got to know this.

00:02:01.598 --> 00:02:03.223 align:middle line:84%
>>ANKA: It's all
about the fact that we

00:02:03.223 --> 00:02:04.500 align:middle line:90%
have the power to choose.

00:02:04.500 --> 00:02:06.080 align:middle line:90%
That's our greatest power.

00:02:06.080 --> 00:02:08.240 align:middle line:90%
And it's about our free will.

00:02:08.240 --> 00:02:12.230 align:middle line:84%
And it's about walking the path
that we're really here to walk.

00:02:12.230 --> 00:02:14.930 align:middle line:84%
Each soul is
unique, but the path

00:02:14.930 --> 00:02:18.060 align:middle line:84%
is different for
everyone because of that.

00:02:18.060 --> 00:02:20.820 align:middle line:84%
And it's about how many
choices do we have,

00:02:20.820 --> 00:02:22.680 align:middle line:90%
what's relevant for our path.

00:02:22.680 --> 00:02:25.800 align:middle line:84%
But we're drawing from
different probabilities,

00:02:25.800 --> 00:02:29.910 align:middle line:84%
different parallel
realities to walk that line.

00:02:29.910 --> 00:02:33.440 align:middle line:84%
What we consider to be a
single timeline in a sense

00:02:33.440 --> 00:02:37.380 align:middle line:84%
is actually composed of choices
from multiple probabilities,

00:02:37.380 --> 00:02:39.330 align:middle line:90%
multiple parallel realities.

00:02:39.330 --> 00:02:42.000 align:middle line:84%
Different things that
we say we go to path A,

00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:43.280 align:middle line:90%
we could experience this.

00:02:43.280 --> 00:02:46.200 align:middle line:84%
If we choose path B, we
could experience that.

00:02:46.200 --> 00:02:49.110 align:middle line:84%
And every choice we
make is changing reality

00:02:49.110 --> 00:02:50.430 align:middle line:90%
every single moment.

00:02:50.430 --> 00:02:54.170 align:middle line:84%
Because physical reality isn't
actually a place that we're in.

00:02:54.170 --> 00:02:56.960 align:middle line:84%
It's something we're
constructing as we go.

00:02:56.960 --> 00:03:00.420 align:middle line:84%
In every single second,
we're redefining who we are,

00:03:00.420 --> 00:03:04.190 align:middle line:84%
and we're changing the idea of
what reality we're experiencing.

00:03:04.190 --> 00:03:08.270 align:middle line:84%
Now most people will create the
next version of their reality

00:03:08.270 --> 00:03:10.700 align:middle line:84%
to be so similar to
the last version,

00:03:10.700 --> 00:03:14.210 align:middle line:84%
that they'll just think it's a
smooth, continuous progression,

00:03:14.210 --> 00:03:17.330 align:middle line:84%
when in fact, according to the
channeled information that comes

00:03:17.330 --> 00:03:20.550 align:middle line:84%
through me, you're actually
changing the entire reality

00:03:20.550 --> 00:03:22.320 align:middle line:90%
every single decision you make.

00:03:22.320 --> 00:03:24.480 align:middle line:90%
Every change is a total change.

00:03:24.480 --> 00:03:28.102 align:middle line:84%
But we can make changes that are
so similar to the last change.

00:03:28.102 --> 00:03:29.810 align:middle line:84%
We don't notice that
much of a difference

00:03:29.810 --> 00:03:33.600 align:middle line:84%
except that we understand it
as the progression of time.

00:03:33.600 --> 00:03:37.040 align:middle line:84%
But that's what the
progression of time is.

00:03:37.040 --> 00:03:40.850 align:middle line:84%
It's a side effect of our
consciousness shifting

00:03:40.850 --> 00:03:44.790 align:middle line:84%
through billions of parallel
realities every single second.

00:03:44.790 --> 00:03:46.830 align:middle line:84%
And as we change
our perspective,

00:03:46.830 --> 00:03:51.030 align:middle line:84%
we are literally changing not
only the reality of the moment.

00:03:51.030 --> 00:03:52.410 align:middle line:90%
We're changing our history.

00:03:52.410 --> 00:03:53.700 align:middle line:90%
We're changing our future.

00:03:53.700 --> 00:03:57.020 align:middle line:84%
Both past and future change
when you change the present

00:03:57.020 --> 00:04:00.210 align:middle line:84%
because everything
stems from here and now

00:04:00.210 --> 00:04:02.220 align:middle line:84%
because now is all
there actually is.

00:04:02.220 --> 00:04:03.480 align:middle line:90%
That's where we exist.

00:04:03.480 --> 00:04:04.280 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:04:04.280 --> 00:04:07.010 align:middle line:84%
>>ANKA: So it's all about all
the probable parallel reality

00:04:07.010 --> 00:04:10.430 align:middle line:84%
choices we can make and
being able to really

00:04:10.430 --> 00:04:13.370 align:middle line:84%
step into our self empowerment
to make the choices

00:04:13.370 --> 00:04:17.149 align:middle line:84%
we prefer to create the
reality that we prefer.

00:04:17.149 --> 00:04:18.480 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: So well stated.

00:04:18.480 --> 00:04:20.630 align:middle line:84%
And so we were having
a little conversation

00:04:20.630 --> 00:04:22.220 align:middle line:90%
off camera about passion.

00:04:22.220 --> 00:04:25.160 align:middle line:84%
And I bring this
up because if we're

00:04:25.160 --> 00:04:29.000 align:middle line:84%
looking at co-creating this
reality that we're all living

00:04:29.000 --> 00:04:30.680 align:middle line:84%
in, that you and I
are here and everyone

00:04:30.680 --> 00:04:32.210 align:middle line:84%
in the studio in
this moment, we're

00:04:32.210 --> 00:04:35.850 align:middle line:84%
all here right now by some
kind of choice and agreement.

00:04:35.850 --> 00:04:38.810 align:middle line:84%
But if you had a
population of citizenry

00:04:38.810 --> 00:04:42.650 align:middle line:84%
around the world that were
making their decisions based

00:04:42.650 --> 00:04:48.530 align:middle line:84%
on an innate passionate
drive compared to constructs

00:04:48.530 --> 00:04:52.620 align:middle line:84%
built by other people, guilt,
society, fear, et cetera.

00:04:52.620 --> 00:04:54.630 align:middle line:84%
You'd have a completely
different outcome.

00:04:54.630 --> 00:04:59.530 align:middle line:84%
So let's talk about what happens
when we construct from passion.

00:04:59.530 --> 00:05:02.000 align:middle line:84%
>>ANKA: Everything
is synchronicity.

00:05:02.000 --> 00:05:04.180 align:middle line:90%
Everything is an orchestration.

00:05:04.180 --> 00:05:06.530 align:middle line:84%
From my perspective,
there are no accidents.

00:05:06.530 --> 00:05:09.970 align:middle line:84%
So no matter what anyone is
choosing, whether it's positive,

00:05:09.970 --> 00:05:12.320 align:middle line:84%
or a negative, or
a neutral choice,

00:05:12.320 --> 00:05:17.590 align:middle line:84%
it all works together to create
the overall consensus reality

00:05:17.590 --> 00:05:19.210 align:middle line:90%
that we experience.

00:05:19.210 --> 00:05:22.540 align:middle line:84%
But if everyone started
really understanding our power

00:05:22.540 --> 00:05:27.560 align:middle line:84%
to choose from passion, then
things would, in a sense,

00:05:27.560 --> 00:05:31.260 align:middle line:84%
all flow in a more positive
direction in general.

00:05:31.260 --> 00:05:33.940 align:middle line:84%
It's like Bashar
often says, it's

00:05:33.940 --> 00:05:37.030 align:middle line:84%
like puzzle pieces
of a picture puzzle.

00:05:37.030 --> 00:05:40.230 align:middle line:84%
We're all made to be a
particular shape of puzzle

00:05:40.230 --> 00:05:41.030 align:middle line:90%
piece.

00:05:41.030 --> 00:05:43.630 align:middle line:84%
If we are true to
our shape, which

00:05:43.630 --> 00:05:45.130 align:middle line:84%
is what following
our passion is all

00:05:45.130 --> 00:05:48.980 align:middle line:84%
about, being true to ourselves,
our innate vibration,

00:05:48.980 --> 00:05:51.790 align:middle line:84%
our core essential
frequency, we are

00:05:51.790 --> 00:05:53.450 align:middle line:90%
the shape we were made to be.

00:05:53.450 --> 00:05:55.760 align:middle line:84%
And if we are the shape
we were made to be,

00:05:55.760 --> 00:05:59.190 align:middle line:84%
we fit with all the other shapes
and create the whole puzzle

00:05:59.190 --> 00:05:59.990 align:middle line:90%
picture.

00:05:59.990 --> 00:06:04.460 align:middle line:84%
If we are following something
that is out of alignment

00:06:04.460 --> 00:06:08.170 align:middle line:84%
with who we are, then our
shape is a little distorted.

00:06:08.170 --> 00:06:12.480 align:middle line:84%
We're not the natural shape that
we originally were made to be.

00:06:12.480 --> 00:06:16.060 align:middle line:84%
And therefore, we don't quite
fit with all the other shapes.

00:06:16.060 --> 00:06:22.040 align:middle line:84%
So the idea of unity and
harmony is not so much

00:06:22.040 --> 00:06:24.990 align:middle line:84%
the idea of everyone
being the same shape,

00:06:24.990 --> 00:06:28.710 align:middle line:84%
but it's the total validation
of the unique shape we are.

00:06:28.710 --> 00:06:32.360 align:middle line:84%
Because by validating the
uniqueness of every individual

00:06:32.360 --> 00:06:35.990 align:middle line:84%
and the differences that are
the positive differences, then

00:06:35.990 --> 00:06:39.030 align:middle line:84%
we all fit together and
create the big picture.

00:06:39.030 --> 00:06:44.660 align:middle line:84%
So the idea of choosing what is
in alignment with who we really

00:06:44.660 --> 00:06:46.850 align:middle line:84%
are is what will
make everything.

00:06:46.850 --> 00:06:50.250 align:middle line:84%
Work when everybody is
choosing from that way,

00:06:50.250 --> 00:06:53.700 align:middle line:84%
from passion, from who they
really are, from their truth,

00:06:53.700 --> 00:06:59.030 align:middle line:84%
then synchronicity becomes this
amazing, magical experience,

00:06:59.030 --> 00:07:01.580 align:middle line:84%
where things just
happen in perfect timing

00:07:01.580 --> 00:07:03.150 align:middle line:90%
exactly when they need to.

00:07:03.150 --> 00:07:05.450 align:middle line:84%
Everything falls in place
because synchronicity

00:07:05.450 --> 00:07:08.570 align:middle line:84%
is an organizing
principle in life.

00:07:08.570 --> 00:07:11.870 align:middle line:84%
And whatever contains
the most passion, if it's

00:07:11.870 --> 00:07:15.350 align:middle line:84%
done first til you
can't do it anymore,

00:07:15.350 --> 00:07:17.840 align:middle line:84%
till the excitement
wanes naturally

00:07:17.840 --> 00:07:21.710 align:middle line:84%
and you look for the next thing
that contains more passion, then

00:07:21.710 --> 00:07:25.460 align:middle line:84%
that synchronicity organizing,
do this first, do this next,

00:07:25.460 --> 00:07:28.490 align:middle line:84%
do this next, it's
literally guiding you

00:07:28.490 --> 00:07:32.960 align:middle line:84%
on the steps of the path that
will let you be who you really

00:07:32.960 --> 00:07:35.490 align:middle line:84%
are and in alignment
with your higher mind,

00:07:35.490 --> 00:07:37.390 align:middle line:84%
your non-physical
self, your soul.

00:07:37.390 --> 00:07:40.070 align:middle line:84%
In other words,
it's like the soul

00:07:40.070 --> 00:07:44.120 align:middle line:84%
is standing on the mountain top,
guiding the physical mind down

00:07:44.120 --> 00:07:45.230 align:middle line:90%
in the valley.

00:07:45.230 --> 00:07:47.640 align:middle line:84%
The physical mind can't
see around the next corner,

00:07:47.640 --> 00:07:49.110 align:middle line:90%
but the higher mind can.

00:07:49.110 --> 00:07:52.500 align:middle line:84%
And so when you get messages
from the higher mind,

00:07:52.500 --> 00:07:55.670 align:middle line:84%
it comes through us in the
form of what we experience

00:07:55.670 --> 00:07:57.160 align:middle line:90%
as passion, creativity.

00:07:57.160 --> 00:07:57.960 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Desire.

00:07:57.960 --> 00:08:00.630 align:middle line:84%
>>ANKA: Desire,
excitement, attraction.

00:08:00.630 --> 00:08:03.080 align:middle line:84%
And when we're willing
to follow that, we're

00:08:03.080 --> 00:08:05.640 align:middle line:84%
following the guidance of
the higher mind and saying,

00:08:05.640 --> 00:08:07.070 align:middle line:90%
here, you need to turn right.

00:08:07.070 --> 00:08:08.810 align:middle line:90%
Here you need to turn left.

00:08:08.810 --> 00:08:11.210 align:middle line:84%
When the physical mind
thinks it's in control

00:08:11.210 --> 00:08:13.010 align:middle line:84%
and tries to take
over and resist

00:08:13.010 --> 00:08:16.280 align:middle line:84%
and say, no, I want to
do this instead and not

00:08:16.280 --> 00:08:18.170 align:middle line:84%
follow my passion,
I want to follow

00:08:18.170 --> 00:08:21.770 align:middle line:84%
what I think over here is
best, and it's not really

00:08:21.770 --> 00:08:24.410 align:middle line:84%
paying attention to what
the higher mind is sending,

00:08:24.410 --> 00:08:26.870 align:middle line:84%
that's when we get into
trouble, and we fall into holes

00:08:26.870 --> 00:08:29.010 align:middle line:84%
and all sorts of stuff
and go, oh, what happened?

00:08:29.010 --> 00:08:30.120 align:middle line:90%
Why didn't that work out?

00:08:30.120 --> 00:08:31.950 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And synchronicity
isn't with you.

00:08:31.950 --> 00:08:33.590 align:middle line:84%
>>ANKA: Well, synchronicity
is, but there's

00:08:33.590 --> 00:08:34.539 align:middle line:90%
negative synchronicity.

00:08:34.539 --> 00:08:34.640 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: OK.

00:08:34.640 --> 00:08:35.460 align:middle line:90%
Negative synchronicity.

00:08:35.460 --> 00:08:36.909 align:middle line:90%
OK, that's a good way to put it.

00:08:36.909 --> 00:08:39.440 align:middle line:84%
Well, let me just add one
little caveat in here,

00:08:39.440 --> 00:08:42.710 align:middle line:84%
and this is personal, but
I think other people have

00:08:42.710 --> 00:08:44.220 align:middle line:90%
experienced this as well.

00:08:44.220 --> 00:08:46.050 align:middle line:90%
I never wanted to be in media.

00:08:46.050 --> 00:08:47.070 align:middle line:90%
I had no interest.

00:08:47.070 --> 00:08:49.970 align:middle line:84%
I'd rather knock off an arm
than get in front of a camera.

00:08:49.970 --> 00:08:51.540 align:middle line:90%
I was so shy.

00:08:51.540 --> 00:08:54.050 align:middle line:84%
I did it on a dare
and got pushed into it

00:08:54.050 --> 00:08:56.300 align:middle line:84%
to the point of tears
and thought I wasn't

00:08:56.300 --> 00:08:58.150 align:middle line:90%
going to get the job anyway.

00:08:58.150 --> 00:08:59.310 align:middle line:90%
Nothing lost.

00:08:59.310 --> 00:09:01.420 align:middle line:90%
And it was not easy.

00:09:01.420 --> 00:09:04.090 align:middle line:84%
Going into the media
as a young woman, that

00:09:04.090 --> 00:09:08.150 align:middle line:84%
was a male-dominated field, had
challenges and pain with it.

00:09:08.150 --> 00:09:10.240 align:middle line:84%
It was not my
desire, but my soul

00:09:10.240 --> 00:09:13.840 align:middle line:84%
was not going to let me
get away with not doing it.

00:09:13.840 --> 00:09:18.430 align:middle line:84%
So even though I didn't like
it, I couldn't say no to it.

00:09:18.430 --> 00:09:22.030 align:middle line:84%
It may not be passion, but
something's driving you forward

00:09:22.030 --> 00:09:23.988 align:middle line:84%
to a larger picture if
you stay with it, right?

00:09:23.988 --> 00:09:24.788 align:middle line:90%
>>ANKA: Yeah.

00:09:24.788 --> 00:09:26.440 align:middle line:84%
And we just use
that word passion

00:09:26.440 --> 00:09:29.480 align:middle line:84%
to be an umbrella for that
drive, for that energy.

00:09:29.480 --> 00:09:30.280 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:09:30.280 --> 00:09:31.738 align:middle line:84%
Just in case people
are thinking it

00:09:31.738 --> 00:09:34.196 align:middle line:84%
has to be a warm and fuzzy,
glowy feeling, not necessarily.

00:09:34.196 --> 00:09:34.996 align:middle line:90%
>>ANKA: No.

00:09:34.996 --> 00:09:36.820 align:middle line:84%
And even as Bashar
says when we talk

00:09:36.820 --> 00:09:38.590 align:middle line:84%
about following your
passion, it doesn't

00:09:38.590 --> 00:09:40.060 align:middle line:84%
mean you have to be
jumping up and down

00:09:40.060 --> 00:09:41.820 align:middle line:84%
and running around with
your hair on fire either.

00:09:41.820 --> 00:09:42.620 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:09:42.620 --> 00:09:45.260 align:middle line:84%
>>ANKA: It can be a
very peaceful, balanced,

00:09:45.260 --> 00:09:47.770 align:middle line:84%
kind of meditative
state as well.

00:09:47.770 --> 00:09:50.090 align:middle line:84%
So there are different
ways to express that.

00:09:50.090 --> 00:09:52.180 align:middle line:84%
So when we use the
word passion, we really

00:09:52.180 --> 00:09:54.850 align:middle line:84%
mean it's that
vibration that comes,

00:09:54.850 --> 00:09:58.480 align:middle line:84%
that message that comes
from your soul, that

00:09:58.480 --> 00:10:01.040 align:middle line:84%
helps you feel like
there is something

00:10:01.040 --> 00:10:06.050 align:middle line:84%
very important about
focusing on this action.

00:10:06.050 --> 00:10:07.640 align:middle line:84%
There is something
that I'm going

00:10:07.640 --> 00:10:12.710 align:middle line:84%
to be doing, by doing this, that
serves my soul's growth, that's

00:10:12.710 --> 00:10:16.575 align:middle line:84%
what challenges are for, and
also serves humanity in general.

00:10:16.575 --> 00:10:17.700 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: You can't say no.

00:10:17.700 --> 00:10:18.720 align:middle line:90%
You got to follow it.

00:10:18.720 --> 00:10:19.520 align:middle line:90%
>>ANKA: Yeah.

00:10:19.520 --> 00:10:22.850 align:middle line:84%
Or you can resist it, but
then all sorts of weird things

00:10:22.850 --> 00:10:23.880 align:middle line:90%
start happening.

00:10:23.880 --> 00:10:26.550 align:middle line:84%
And sometimes, when
people resist it enough,

00:10:26.550 --> 00:10:31.040 align:middle line:84%
they drive themselves into
having things like accidents

00:10:31.040 --> 00:10:33.680 align:middle line:84%
because then, they need
that shock to turn them

00:10:33.680 --> 00:10:36.450 align:middle line:84%
around and go, OK,
OK, I get the picture.

00:10:36.450 --> 00:10:38.150 align:middle line:84%
I need to make a
change, and I need

00:10:38.150 --> 00:10:39.540 align:middle line:90%
to go in a different direction.

00:10:39.540 --> 00:10:43.790 align:middle line:84%
So the idea is to not have to
wait until something hits you

00:10:43.790 --> 00:10:46.500 align:middle line:84%
in the head like a brick
to get the message across.

00:10:46.500 --> 00:10:48.960 align:middle line:84%
It's like pay attention
to that drive.

00:10:48.960 --> 00:10:53.510 align:middle line:84%
Pay attention to that momentum
and follow that curiosity.

00:10:53.510 --> 00:10:54.900 align:middle line:90%
Follow that attraction.

00:10:54.900 --> 00:10:56.370 align:middle line:90%
Follow that challenge.

00:10:56.370 --> 00:10:58.110 align:middle line:90%
It's there for a reason.

00:10:58.110 --> 00:11:01.200 align:middle line:84%
And it will actually wind
up serving you and serving

00:11:01.200 --> 00:11:02.010 align:middle line:90%
humanity.

00:11:02.010 --> 00:11:04.343 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: There's no place
I'd rather be than right here

00:11:04.343 --> 00:11:05.923 align:middle line:90%
at this moment and--

00:11:05.923 --> 00:11:07.590 align:middle line:84%
>>ANKA: Exactly, and
here you are, yeah.

00:11:07.590 --> 00:11:09.465 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Painful as it
was in the beginning.

00:11:09.465 --> 00:11:11.520 align:middle line:84%
So let me just ask you
a question, backing up

00:11:11.520 --> 00:11:13.410 align:middle line:84%
quite a bit in your
own life, because it's

00:11:13.410 --> 00:11:15.870 align:middle line:84%
the first time I've had
here, though many people here

00:11:15.870 --> 00:11:18.430 align:middle line:84%
are already familiar with
your work for decades.

00:11:18.430 --> 00:11:20.160 align:middle line:84%
What was the thing
that drove you

00:11:20.160 --> 00:11:22.560 align:middle line:90%
into this in the very beginning?

00:11:22.560 --> 00:11:28.540 align:middle line:84%
>>ANKA: I had, back in 1973, two
broad daylight UFO sightings.

00:11:28.540 --> 00:11:29.910 align:middle line:90%
Very close.

00:11:29.910 --> 00:11:34.470 align:middle line:84%
And I've always heard,
OK, there are UFOs.

00:11:34.470 --> 00:11:38.340 align:middle line:84%
But when you see something
like that physically in front

00:11:38.340 --> 00:11:41.640 align:middle line:84%
of your face, only
100 feet away,

00:11:41.640 --> 00:11:45.460 align:middle line:84%
and you have witnesses
with you, and you go, OK,

00:11:45.460 --> 00:11:49.920 align:middle line:84%
what I was told about reality
is not what reality is.

00:11:49.920 --> 00:11:52.793 align:middle line:84%
There is something going
on here behind the scenes,

00:11:52.793 --> 00:11:54.210 align:middle line:84%
and I need to
figure out what that

00:11:54.210 --> 00:11:56.290 align:middle line:84%
is because when you see
something like that,

00:11:56.290 --> 00:11:58.630 align:middle line:90%
it changes you viscerally.

00:11:58.630 --> 00:12:02.640 align:middle line:84%
Because again, your reality
just simply comes apart,

00:12:02.640 --> 00:12:05.020 align:middle line:84%
and you go, OK,
what's going on here?

00:12:05.020 --> 00:12:06.010 align:middle line:90%
What is this?

00:12:06.010 --> 00:12:08.340 align:middle line:84%
And so that started
me investigating

00:12:08.340 --> 00:12:10.330 align:middle line:90%
all of those kinds of things.

00:12:10.330 --> 00:12:14.910 align:middle line:84%
And 10 years after the sighting,
I was introduced to a channel

00:12:14.910 --> 00:12:18.090 align:middle line:84%
who was doing sessions
because at that point,

00:12:18.090 --> 00:12:20.370 align:middle line:84%
I had come across
other books like UFOs,

00:12:20.370 --> 00:12:22.650 align:middle line:84%
and then psychic
functioning, and ESP,

00:12:22.650 --> 00:12:25.530 align:middle line:84%
and channeling and all sorts,
specifically the Jane Roberts

00:12:25.530 --> 00:12:27.330 align:middle line:90%
"Seth Material."

00:12:27.330 --> 00:12:29.620 align:middle line:84%
So I understood what
that was all about.

00:12:29.620 --> 00:12:32.580 align:middle line:84%
And I went to listen
to this channel,

00:12:32.580 --> 00:12:34.720 align:middle line:84%
and I thought the
information is very helpful.

00:12:34.720 --> 00:12:36.010 align:middle line:90%
It's very insightful.

00:12:36.010 --> 00:12:38.940 align:middle line:84%
And then eventually,
the entity offered

00:12:38.940 --> 00:12:40.232 align:middle line:90%
to teach a channeling class.

00:12:40.232 --> 00:12:41.940 align:middle line:84%
And I said, well, I
didn't think that was

00:12:41.940 --> 00:12:43.630 align:middle line:90%
something that could be taught.

00:12:43.630 --> 00:12:46.390 align:middle line:84%
I just thought it was sort of
happened to you out of the blue.

00:12:46.390 --> 00:12:49.090 align:middle line:84%
Because that was the story
of most channels back then.

00:12:49.090 --> 00:12:49.350 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: True.

00:12:49.350 --> 00:12:51.930 align:middle line:84%
>>ANKA: They would just suddenly
pass out, and start talking,

00:12:51.930 --> 00:12:53.800 align:middle line:84%
and wake up and not
know what they had said.

00:12:53.800 --> 00:12:56.050 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: '80s was really
rich and abundant with that.

00:12:56.050 --> 00:12:56.850 align:middle line:90%
>>ANKA: Yeah.

00:12:56.850 --> 00:12:59.710 align:middle line:84%
And each generation of
channels has become, in a way,

00:12:59.710 --> 00:13:02.900 align:middle line:84%
more and more conscious because
they're choosing it consciously

00:13:02.900 --> 00:13:04.980 align:middle line:84%
and able to bring it
through more consciously.

00:13:04.980 --> 00:13:08.730 align:middle line:84%
So I see that as an evolution
in the pattern of channeling.

00:13:08.730 --> 00:13:12.560 align:middle line:84%
But it was during the class
I went into not thinking,

00:13:12.560 --> 00:13:14.190 align:middle line:90%
I'm going to become a channel.

00:13:14.190 --> 00:13:16.460 align:middle line:84%
I just wanted to understand
how channeling could be

00:13:16.460 --> 00:13:18.540 align:middle line:90%
taught as part of my research.

00:13:18.540 --> 00:13:22.010 align:middle line:84%
But we were given guided
meditations over a 12-week

00:13:22.010 --> 00:13:24.440 align:middle line:84%
course to get us in
touch with whatever.

00:13:24.440 --> 00:13:26.130 align:middle line:84%
We didn't have to
channel an entity.

00:13:26.130 --> 00:13:28.172 align:middle line:84%
It was like getting in
touch with your creativity

00:13:28.172 --> 00:13:31.490 align:middle line:84%
or whatever you wanted to
do with that state of being.

00:13:31.490 --> 00:13:33.650 align:middle line:84%
But halfway through
the course, when

00:13:33.650 --> 00:13:35.730 align:middle line:84%
we were in the middle
of a meditation,

00:13:35.730 --> 00:13:39.030 align:middle line:84%
being guided by the
entity, I received

00:13:39.030 --> 00:13:42.140 align:middle line:84%
what I can only describe
as a telepathic connection

00:13:42.140 --> 00:13:43.380 align:middle line:90%
from Bashar.

00:13:43.380 --> 00:13:47.070 align:middle line:84%
And in that instant,
inside my head,

00:13:47.070 --> 00:13:49.190 align:middle line:84%
a memory came back of
having made an agreement

00:13:49.190 --> 00:13:50.880 align:middle line:90%
to do this before this life.

00:13:50.880 --> 00:13:53.960 align:middle line:84%
I understood the UFO had been
shown to me on purpose by him

00:13:53.960 --> 00:13:56.330 align:middle line:84%
to get me to start
doing the research.

00:13:56.330 --> 00:13:58.460 align:middle line:84%
I understood that
now was the time

00:13:58.460 --> 00:14:00.830 align:middle line:84%
to move forward with
this if I still wanted

00:14:00.830 --> 00:14:02.440 align:middle line:90%
to move forward with this.

00:14:02.440 --> 00:14:04.360 align:middle line:84%
It was still
offered as a choice.

00:14:04.360 --> 00:14:09.010 align:middle line:84%
But I understood enough to
know that if I did go forward,

00:14:09.010 --> 00:14:12.120 align:middle line:84%
it would be something
that would expand my life.

00:14:12.120 --> 00:14:16.170 align:middle line:84%
All of this was happening
with an image of his face

00:14:16.170 --> 00:14:18.220 align:middle line:90%
in my mind in a split second.

00:14:18.220 --> 00:14:20.590 align:middle line:84%
Now I didn't know if
I was hallucinating,

00:14:20.590 --> 00:14:23.310 align:middle line:84%
if this was a side
effect of the meditation.

00:14:23.310 --> 00:14:25.740 align:middle line:84%
But the second this
happened, because I

00:14:25.740 --> 00:14:29.060 align:middle line:84%
hadn't said anything, the entity
stopped talking to the class

00:14:29.060 --> 00:14:30.920 align:middle line:84%
and turned to me
and said, there's

00:14:30.920 --> 00:14:34.670 align:middle line:84%
an entity here for you right
now if you're ready to begin.

00:14:34.670 --> 00:14:38.060 align:middle line:84%
And I opened my eyes,
and I looked behind me,

00:14:38.060 --> 00:14:41.210 align:middle line:84%
and one of my classmates
somehow had also

00:14:41.210 --> 00:14:44.010 align:middle line:84%
picked up on the image
of Bashar's face, I saw.

00:14:44.010 --> 00:14:46.070 align:middle line:84%
And she was sketching
it on a piece of paper.

00:14:46.070 --> 00:14:49.710 align:middle line:84%
So I said, OK, I've got
two outside validations.

00:14:49.710 --> 00:14:51.390 align:middle line:90%
This is not my imagination.

00:14:51.390 --> 00:14:53.660 align:middle line:84%
There's something
happening here.

00:14:53.660 --> 00:14:56.340 align:middle line:84%
So I said, OK, let's see
where this is going to go.

00:14:56.340 --> 00:14:59.160 align:middle line:84%
So I began to practice
more in the class.

00:14:59.160 --> 00:15:01.880 align:middle line:84%
I got good enough,
quickly enough

00:15:01.880 --> 00:15:04.850 align:middle line:84%
that the teacher offered
to allow me to co-channel

00:15:04.850 --> 00:15:07.658 align:middle line:90%
the next class with him.

00:15:07.658 --> 00:15:09.450 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Did this make
you nervous at all?

00:15:09.450 --> 00:15:11.480 align:middle line:84%
>>ANKA: No, it didn't,
because, again, by that time,

00:15:11.480 --> 00:15:12.050 align:middle line:90%
I understood--

00:15:12.050 --> 00:15:13.470 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: You knew you
were there for this.

00:15:13.470 --> 00:15:15.120 align:middle line:84%
>>ANKA: --what
this was all about.

00:15:15.120 --> 00:15:18.350 align:middle line:84%
And so I was just mostly
curious and fascinated that this

00:15:18.350 --> 00:15:19.230 align:middle line:90%
was happening.

00:15:19.230 --> 00:15:22.380 align:middle line:84%
I mean, it was strange, it
was unusual, it was new,

00:15:22.380 --> 00:15:23.970 align:middle line:84%
and it was definitely
challenging.

00:15:23.970 --> 00:15:25.230 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: But it was destined.

00:15:25.230 --> 00:15:26.960 align:middle line:84%
>>ANKA: But I just
figured I'm going

00:15:26.960 --> 00:15:28.650 align:middle line:90%
to have to see where this goes.

00:15:28.650 --> 00:15:31.370 align:middle line:84%
Because if this is
what's happening to me,

00:15:31.370 --> 00:15:32.910 align:middle line:90%
there's a reason for it.

00:15:32.910 --> 00:15:34.320 align:middle line:90%
I knew that much.

00:15:34.320 --> 00:15:38.060 align:middle line:84%
And so let's see where
it takes me, right?

00:15:38.060 --> 00:15:40.430 align:middle line:84%
And even before I
knew about the idea

00:15:40.430 --> 00:15:42.740 align:middle line:84%
from Bashar of
following your passion,

00:15:42.740 --> 00:15:48.380 align:middle line:84%
I have always instinctively
in my life really only done

00:15:48.380 --> 00:15:52.140 align:middle line:84%
what I was excited to do,
and it's always supported me.

00:15:52.140 --> 00:15:53.210 align:middle line:90%
Always.

00:15:53.210 --> 00:15:55.800 align:middle line:84%
That's another lesson I often
want to share with people,

00:15:55.800 --> 00:15:58.010 align:middle line:84%
is when you follow
your passion, it

00:15:58.010 --> 00:16:00.900 align:middle line:84%
will support you if
you don't resist it.

00:16:00.900 --> 00:16:03.120 align:middle line:90%
So it always has worked for me.

00:16:03.120 --> 00:16:05.510 align:middle line:84%
I mean, I've been doing
this for 40 years.

00:16:05.510 --> 00:16:08.620 align:middle line:84%
There has never been a time
when it hasn't supported me.

00:16:08.620 --> 00:16:11.010 align:middle line:84%
And following my
passion in other areas,

00:16:11.010 --> 00:16:13.860 align:middle line:84%
hasn't ever been a time
when it hasn't supported me.

00:16:13.860 --> 00:16:15.970 align:middle line:90%
So that's a big lesson to learn.

00:16:15.970 --> 00:16:17.380 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: It's a big one.

00:16:17.380 --> 00:16:19.980 align:middle line:84%
And the other thing we didn't
talk about a little bit ago

00:16:19.980 --> 00:16:22.120 align:middle line:84%
on the subject of passion
that you just brought up

00:16:22.120 --> 00:16:25.320 align:middle line:84%
was you understood that you
had an agreement before you

00:16:25.320 --> 00:16:27.820 align:middle line:84%
were incarnated to do
this thing with Bashar.

00:16:27.820 --> 00:16:30.760 align:middle line:84%
And when we were
talking off camera,

00:16:30.760 --> 00:16:35.250 align:middle line:84%
the notion that these agreements
that our soul has made

00:16:35.250 --> 00:16:40.260 align:middle line:84%
for an incarnation comes through
the whispering of our soul

00:16:40.260 --> 00:16:44.155 align:middle line:84%
to the subject of passion
and yes, now, do it, do it.

00:16:44.155 --> 00:16:45.780 align:middle line:84%
It's coming through,
but that agreement

00:16:45.780 --> 00:16:48.100 align:middle line:84%
was made before
incarnation often times.

00:16:48.100 --> 00:16:48.900 align:middle line:90%
>>ANKA: Yes.

00:16:48.900 --> 00:16:51.460 align:middle line:84%
And it was made from the
free will of the spirit.

00:16:51.460 --> 00:16:51.970 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Of the soul, yes.

00:16:51.970 --> 00:16:52.803 align:middle line:90%
>>ANKA: Of the soul.

00:16:52.803 --> 00:16:57.180 align:middle line:84%
And then that creates a path
that we could euphemistically

00:16:57.180 --> 00:17:00.490 align:middle line:84%
say that's the destiny
of the physical mind.

00:17:00.490 --> 00:17:05.560 align:middle line:84%
But within that destiny chosen
by the free will of the soul,

00:17:05.560 --> 00:17:07.109 align:middle line:84%
you still have a
lot of free will

00:17:07.109 --> 00:17:10.467 align:middle line:84%
as a physical mind to decide how
you're going to walk that path.

00:17:10.467 --> 00:17:12.300 align:middle line:84%
Because you can face
your challenges, or you

00:17:12.300 --> 00:17:13.650 align:middle line:90%
can shy away from them.

00:17:13.650 --> 00:17:18.250 align:middle line:84%
You can walk down that path
happy, sad, left, right,

00:17:18.250 --> 00:17:21.010 align:middle line:90%
crawl, fly, run, walk, whatever.

00:17:21.010 --> 00:17:23.740 align:middle line:84%
That's up to you
as how to do that.

00:17:23.740 --> 00:17:25.930 align:middle line:84%
But you will walk
down that path.

00:17:25.930 --> 00:17:28.200 align:middle line:84%
So we could say that the
free will of the soul

00:17:28.200 --> 00:17:30.460 align:middle line:84%
creates the destiny
of the physical mind,

00:17:30.460 --> 00:17:32.850 align:middle line:84%
but the physical mind
still has a lot of leeway

00:17:32.850 --> 00:17:36.760 align:middle line:84%
and a lot of free will on that
path as how to experience it.

00:17:36.760 --> 00:17:41.400 align:middle line:84%
And since the soul is eternal,
in a sense, if for some reason,

00:17:41.400 --> 00:17:43.740 align:middle line:84%
you resist it enough
that you don't actually

00:17:43.740 --> 00:17:47.177 align:middle line:84%
complete what you agreed to
complete, well, you're eternal

00:17:47.177 --> 00:17:48.010 align:middle line:90%
and you're infinite.

00:17:48.010 --> 00:17:48.280 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: That's all right.

00:17:48.280 --> 00:17:48.990 align:middle line:90%
You'll have another shot at it.

00:17:48.990 --> 00:17:50.365 align:middle line:84%
>>ANKA: You'll
have another shot.

00:17:50.365 --> 00:17:51.840 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: That's really truly--

00:17:51.840 --> 00:17:53.880 align:middle line:84%
>>ANKA: You will always have a
second, and third, and fourth,

00:17:53.880 --> 00:17:55.240 align:middle line:90%
and fifth, and sixth chance.

00:17:55.240 --> 00:17:56.740 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: There's
an infinite amount

00:17:56.740 --> 00:17:58.060 align:middle line:90%
of grace alongside all of this.

00:17:58.060 --> 00:17:58.770 align:middle line:90%
>>ANKA: Exactly.

00:17:58.770 --> 00:17:59.570 align:middle line:90%
Exactly.

00:17:59.570 --> 00:18:00.850 align:middle line:90%
So yeah.

00:18:00.850 --> 00:18:04.410 align:middle line:84%
So I followed that
path, saw where it went.

00:18:04.410 --> 00:18:07.530 align:middle line:84%
Somebody came along
doing a doctoral paper

00:18:07.530 --> 00:18:10.000 align:middle line:84%
on the connection between
channeling and psychology,

00:18:10.000 --> 00:18:11.530 align:middle line:84%
and she needed
subjects to study.

00:18:11.530 --> 00:18:14.040 align:middle line:84%
I became one of her
subjects, channeling

00:18:14.040 --> 00:18:17.290 align:middle line:84%
to her friends at her house
while she wrote her notes.

00:18:17.290 --> 00:18:19.870 align:middle line:84%
And that started to just
spread word of mouth.

00:18:19.870 --> 00:18:23.200 align:middle line:84%
And so I found myself in
the years that followed,

00:18:23.200 --> 00:18:25.300 align:middle line:84%
being invited to go
to different cities,

00:18:25.300 --> 00:18:26.860 align:middle line:84%
invited to go to
different countries,

00:18:26.860 --> 00:18:28.630 align:middle line:90%
and here I am 40 years later.

00:18:28.630 --> 00:18:30.130 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And I'm
grateful for that.

00:18:30.130 --> 00:18:30.930 align:middle line:90%
Thank you.

00:18:30.930 --> 00:18:31.980 align:middle line:90%
>>ANKA: So am I.

00:18:31.980 --> 00:18:34.350 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So let's
get into some of what

00:18:34.350 --> 00:18:38.440 align:middle line:84%
seems the high
strangeness of reality.

00:18:38.440 --> 00:18:41.460 align:middle line:84%
And one of them is called
the Mandela effect.

00:18:41.460 --> 00:18:44.250 align:middle line:84%
And so let's look at
that because that's still

00:18:44.250 --> 00:18:45.370 align:middle line:90%
very intriguing.

00:18:45.370 --> 00:18:47.403 align:middle line:84%
I know in quantum physics,
a lot of scientists

00:18:47.403 --> 00:18:48.820 align:middle line:84%
are still trying
to figure it out,

00:18:48.820 --> 00:18:51.480 align:middle line:84%
but you've given very
elegant explanations

00:18:51.480 --> 00:18:52.990 align:middle line:90%
of what this is about.

00:18:52.990 --> 00:18:55.863 align:middle line:84%
So simply put, to
me, one of the most--

00:18:55.863 --> 00:18:57.280 align:middle line:84%
there are many,
many obvious ones,

00:18:57.280 --> 00:19:01.530 align:middle line:84%
but one that got me because
I knew I'd seen it was

00:19:01.530 --> 00:19:05.100 align:middle line:84%
in literature, the book called
"A Portrait of Dorian Gray,"

00:19:05.100 --> 00:19:07.360 align:middle line:84%
which, of course, doesn't
exist, never exists.

00:19:07.360 --> 00:19:08.470 align:middle line:90%
You can't find it.

00:19:08.470 --> 00:19:12.130 align:middle line:84%
But I got it to blip up on
the internet for a second.

00:19:12.130 --> 00:19:15.360 align:middle line:84%
I saw it, and then
it disappeared again

00:19:15.360 --> 00:19:19.050 align:middle line:84%
into "A Picture of Dorian Gray,"
which now you would never,

00:19:19.050 --> 00:19:21.220 align:middle line:90%
even the old copies of it say.

00:19:21.220 --> 00:19:23.380 align:middle line:84%
So let's talk about
what's going on there?

00:19:23.380 --> 00:19:24.340 align:middle line:90%
I'm not crazy.

00:19:24.340 --> 00:19:26.620 align:middle line:84%
Other English
majors aren't crazy.

00:19:26.620 --> 00:19:29.430 align:middle line:84%
>>ANKA: Now, I do have
to say there is a caveat.

00:19:29.430 --> 00:19:33.060 align:middle line:84%
Yes, it's possible
that sometimes the idea

00:19:33.060 --> 00:19:35.310 align:middle line:84%
of what appears to
be the Mandela effect

00:19:35.310 --> 00:19:37.840 align:middle line:90%
is simply a faulty memory.

00:19:37.840 --> 00:19:38.640 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:19:38.640 --> 00:19:40.650 align:middle line:84%
And I think they
acknowledge that.

00:19:40.650 --> 00:19:41.860 align:middle line:90%
>>ANKA: That can happen.

00:19:41.860 --> 00:19:44.310 align:middle line:84%
So not everything is
the Mandela effect.

00:19:44.310 --> 00:19:48.570 align:middle line:84%
But my understanding
is, as we have now,

00:19:48.570 --> 00:19:51.600 align:middle line:84%
as a society, more
and more individuals

00:19:51.600 --> 00:19:54.430 align:middle line:84%
decided that they're going
to explore consciousness.

00:19:54.430 --> 00:19:58.270 align:middle line:84%
They're going to expand their
idea of what reality is.

00:19:58.270 --> 00:20:01.850 align:middle line:84%
They're going to
connect more to spirit.

00:20:01.850 --> 00:20:04.670 align:middle line:84%
When we decide to
go down that path,

00:20:04.670 --> 00:20:08.760 align:middle line:84%
in expanding our consciousness,
our senses start to expand.

00:20:08.760 --> 00:20:10.850 align:middle line:84%
We start to be able to
perceive things that

00:20:10.850 --> 00:20:15.320 align:middle line:84%
were heretofore invisible,
like parallel realities.

00:20:15.320 --> 00:20:18.840 align:middle line:84%
Each parallel reality has
its own distinct vibration.

00:20:18.840 --> 00:20:23.420 align:middle line:84%
Just like a program on a TV
set, you are tuned to a channel,

00:20:23.420 --> 00:20:25.340 align:middle line:84%
and you're watching
that program.

00:20:25.340 --> 00:20:28.920 align:middle line:84%
Now you know other programs
are playing at the same time,

00:20:28.920 --> 00:20:32.160 align:middle line:84%
but you're only getting the
one that you are tuned to.

00:20:32.160 --> 00:20:34.950 align:middle line:84%
So that's been our
experience in the past.

00:20:34.950 --> 00:20:36.950 align:middle line:84%
We're getting one
program that we're

00:20:36.950 --> 00:20:39.900 align:middle line:84%
tuned to because that's the
consensus belief system.

00:20:39.900 --> 00:20:42.680 align:middle line:84%
This is reality, and
there isn't anything else.

00:20:42.680 --> 00:20:45.230 align:middle line:84%
But when you start
expanding, it's

00:20:45.230 --> 00:20:48.500 align:middle line:84%
kind of like having multiple
screens on your TV set.

00:20:48.500 --> 00:20:51.450 align:middle line:84%
And suddenly, you are
watching this program,

00:20:51.450 --> 00:20:53.270 align:middle line:84%
but you can also
glimpse that one

00:20:53.270 --> 00:20:55.280 align:middle line:84%
it's bleeding into
because you're

00:20:55.280 --> 00:20:59.340 align:middle line:84%
expanding your field of
vision, your consciousness

00:20:59.340 --> 00:21:00.390 align:middle line:90%
field of vision.

00:21:00.390 --> 00:21:02.520 align:middle line:84%
And so you're starting
to pick up on the fact

00:21:02.520 --> 00:21:06.090 align:middle line:84%
that there are other probable
realities where maybe here, you

00:21:06.090 --> 00:21:09.060 align:middle line:84%
went one way, but in the other
one, you went the other way.

00:21:09.060 --> 00:21:11.320 align:middle line:90%
So history is different.

00:21:11.320 --> 00:21:14.610 align:middle line:84%
But we're at that
point where we are just

00:21:14.610 --> 00:21:17.880 align:middle line:84%
beginning to see the overlap,
just beginning to experience

00:21:17.880 --> 00:21:18.870 align:middle line:90%
the bleed-through.

00:21:18.870 --> 00:21:24.620 align:middle line:84%
So we can still retain
perception of both programs

00:21:24.620 --> 00:21:26.240 align:middle line:90%
because we're expanding.

00:21:26.240 --> 00:21:28.680 align:middle line:84%
And we're not just
picking one or the other.

00:21:28.680 --> 00:21:30.800 align:middle line:84%
We're just experiencing
the idea that there

00:21:30.800 --> 00:21:34.410 align:middle line:84%
is more than one probable
outcome for a reality.

00:21:34.410 --> 00:21:37.010 align:middle line:84%
And because we start
picking up on this,

00:21:37.010 --> 00:21:40.050 align:middle line:84%
and maybe we have more of an
affinity for that outcome,

00:21:40.050 --> 00:21:44.670 align:middle line:84%
we start saying, oh, that is the
history that I believe is true.

00:21:44.670 --> 00:21:46.700 align:middle line:84%
Whereas another person
goes, no, no, no,

00:21:46.700 --> 00:21:48.610 align:middle line:90%
I remember history differently.

00:21:48.610 --> 00:21:50.030 align:middle line:90%
This is what happened.

00:21:50.030 --> 00:21:51.110 align:middle line:90%
Not that.

00:21:51.110 --> 00:21:54.500 align:middle line:84%
Both people can be right because
they're actually picking up

00:21:54.500 --> 00:21:57.110 align:middle line:84%
on completely different
parallel reality histories

00:21:57.110 --> 00:22:00.110 align:middle line:84%
because we now have the
ability for our consciousness

00:22:00.110 --> 00:22:03.800 align:middle line:84%
to have that
multi-dimensional perception.

00:22:03.800 --> 00:22:08.060 align:middle line:84%
So the Mandela effect to me
is part of our consciousness

00:22:08.060 --> 00:22:11.510 align:middle line:84%
expansion, where we realize
that we are plucking

00:22:11.510 --> 00:22:13.370 align:middle line:84%
from different
parallel realities

00:22:13.370 --> 00:22:15.450 align:middle line:90%
to decide what our path is.

00:22:15.450 --> 00:22:18.570 align:middle line:84%
We're becoming aware of how
we're creating our reality.

00:22:18.570 --> 00:22:20.930 align:middle line:84%
What we consider to
be a single timeline

00:22:20.930 --> 00:22:23.590 align:middle line:84%
is actually made of
multiple timelines,

00:22:23.590 --> 00:22:25.630 align:middle line:90%
multiple parallel realities.

00:22:25.630 --> 00:22:29.830 align:middle line:84%
But with our concept
of continuity,

00:22:29.830 --> 00:22:32.290 align:middle line:84%
that one thing has
to follow another,

00:22:32.290 --> 00:22:35.610 align:middle line:84%
we may be jumping all
over the place in terms

00:22:35.610 --> 00:22:38.820 align:middle line:84%
of this parallel reality piece
and this parallel reality

00:22:38.820 --> 00:22:41.130 align:middle line:84%
outcome, but putting
it all together

00:22:41.130 --> 00:22:44.220 align:middle line:84%
in a linear continuity
that makes sense for us

00:22:44.220 --> 00:22:45.900 align:middle line:90%
in physical reality.

00:22:45.900 --> 00:22:49.480 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So that brings me down
to the nuts and bolts of it.

00:22:49.480 --> 00:22:52.740 align:middle line:84%
So you have a team of
ad execs, and they're

00:22:52.740 --> 00:22:54.960 align:middle line:84%
deciding whether to call
it Jif or Jiffy Peanut

00:22:54.960 --> 00:22:59.310 align:middle line:84%
Butter or Stouffer's Stovetop
or the famous ones, Berenstein

00:22:59.310 --> 00:23:00.640 align:middle line:90%
or Berenstain Bears.

00:23:00.640 --> 00:23:03.120 align:middle line:84%
So you have a
discussion going on as

00:23:03.120 --> 00:23:05.350 align:middle line:84%
to whether we should go
this direction or that.

00:23:05.350 --> 00:23:09.300 align:middle line:84%
Are people simply
tagging on to a timeline

00:23:09.300 --> 00:23:11.850 align:middle line:84%
where it wasn't fully
fixed yet, or it was simply

00:23:11.850 --> 00:23:14.820 align:middle line:84%
an option that was
put into motion where

00:23:14.820 --> 00:23:17.650 align:middle line:84%
they may have ultimately
chosen the other one.

00:23:17.650 --> 00:23:22.590 align:middle line:84%
How do you get on these
strange, prosaic timelines

00:23:22.590 --> 00:23:24.880 align:middle line:84%
about peanut butter
and stovetop stuffing?

00:23:24.880 --> 00:23:27.790 align:middle line:84%
>>ANKA: Well, again,
the consensus reality,

00:23:27.790 --> 00:23:31.420 align:middle line:84%
whether someone individually is
aware of what's going on or not,

00:23:31.420 --> 00:23:33.420 align:middle line:84%
they'll still be a part
of the consensus that

00:23:33.420 --> 00:23:36.100 align:middle line:84%
is allowing for different
probable outcomes.

00:23:36.100 --> 00:23:40.650 align:middle line:10%
And so when they're in a
creative mode, when they're

00:23:40.650 --> 00:23:43.590 align:middle line:10%
open to the idea of
looking for a path,

00:23:43.590 --> 00:23:46.690 align:middle line:10%
they might simply pick up
on, well, I don't know.

00:23:46.690 --> 00:23:48.863 align:middle line:10%
This feels more right
for some reason,

00:23:48.863 --> 00:23:50.280 align:middle line:10%
and somebody may
disagree with it,

00:23:50.280 --> 00:23:52.060 align:middle line:10%
or they may go along with it.

00:23:52.060 --> 00:23:55.660 align:middle line:84%
But I think those options are
opening up to different people,

00:23:55.660 --> 00:23:57.220 align:middle line:90%
whether they realize it or not.

00:23:57.220 --> 00:23:59.520 align:middle line:84%
And if they're in any
kind of a creative mode

00:23:59.520 --> 00:24:02.340 align:middle line:84%
where they're willing to
scan for possibilities,

00:24:02.340 --> 00:24:03.930 align:middle line:84%
they're just going
to pick up on that.

00:24:03.930 --> 00:24:07.870 align:middle line:84%
And they're going to choose one
way or another, that for that,

00:24:07.870 --> 00:24:12.930 align:middle line:84%
let's say, subgroup in the
consensus, that mini consensus

00:24:12.930 --> 00:24:15.600 align:middle line:84%
reality, is for
some reason the path

00:24:15.600 --> 00:24:17.073 align:middle line:84%
that they feel
they need to walk.

00:24:17.073 --> 00:24:19.240 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: It had to have
had some stickiness though,

00:24:19.240 --> 00:24:22.000 align:middle line:84%
just for anyone to
magnetize to that reality.

00:24:22.000 --> 00:24:23.316 align:middle line:84%
>>ANKA: Well, yeah, because
it's all about resonance.

00:24:23.316 --> 00:24:23.580 align:middle line:90%
It's all about vibration.

00:24:23.580 --> 00:24:23.910 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:24:23.910 --> 00:24:25.410 align:middle line:84%
So maybe it's just
if they've talked

00:24:25.410 --> 00:24:28.080 align:middle line:84%
to-- so say you have a team,
and they're talking and debating

00:24:28.080 --> 00:24:29.130 align:middle line:90%
these two options.

00:24:29.130 --> 00:24:31.770 align:middle line:84%
Perhaps it's been debated
long enough that there's

00:24:31.770 --> 00:24:34.470 align:middle line:84%
a little stickiness, a little
thought form substance to it

00:24:34.470 --> 00:24:36.652 align:middle line:84%
that you could
have either memory.

00:24:36.652 --> 00:24:38.200 align:middle line:90%
>>ANKA: Oh, absolutely, you can.

00:24:38.200 --> 00:24:41.050 align:middle line:84%
Yeah, if that serves you to
have that right, you will.

00:24:41.050 --> 00:24:43.172 align:middle line:84%
Otherwise, you'll just
take one path or the other

00:24:43.172 --> 00:24:44.880 align:middle line:84%
and never know the
difference, that there

00:24:44.880 --> 00:24:46.000 align:middle line:90%
could have been another path.

00:24:46.000 --> 00:24:48.125 align:middle line:84%
But it just depends on the
group that's doing that.

00:24:48.125 --> 00:24:52.080 align:middle line:84%
And what is the ultimate path
that they need to walk together?

00:24:52.080 --> 00:24:55.200 align:middle line:84%
If they need to maintain
the idea that there's

00:24:55.200 --> 00:24:59.760 align:middle line:84%
more than one outcome and keep
that awareness in their group,

00:24:59.760 --> 00:25:02.220 align:middle line:84%
then that's what works
for them in the path

00:25:02.220 --> 00:25:03.460 align:middle line:90%
that they're walking.

00:25:03.460 --> 00:25:05.255 align:middle line:84%
Others will simply
pick one or the other,

00:25:05.255 --> 00:25:06.880 align:middle line:84%
and they'll go that
way, and that's it.

00:25:06.880 --> 00:25:08.837 align:middle line:84%
And they'll never know
that they could have been.

00:25:08.837 --> 00:25:09.637 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:25:09.637 --> 00:25:11.610 align:middle line:84%
I just find it crazy
in that, I mean, I

00:25:11.610 --> 00:25:14.100 align:middle line:84%
can understand it on all of
the bigger issues of life

00:25:14.100 --> 00:25:15.040 align:middle line:90%
that we debate.

00:25:15.040 --> 00:25:17.975 align:middle line:84%
But on all these silly little,
seemingly silly little issues--

00:25:17.975 --> 00:25:18.137 align:middle line:90%
>>ANKA: But that's what I mean.

00:25:18.137 --> 00:25:18.280 align:middle line:90%
It's part of the consensus.

00:25:18.280 --> 00:25:19.810 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: It doesn't
matter consensus.

00:25:19.810 --> 00:25:21.010 align:middle line:84%
It's part of the
consensus, yeah.

00:25:21.010 --> 00:25:22.560 align:middle line:84%
>>ANKA: That you
now have the ability

00:25:22.560 --> 00:25:24.400 align:middle line:84%
to do that if that
works for you.

00:25:24.400 --> 00:25:25.240 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:25:25.240 --> 00:25:29.410 align:middle line:84%
So you brought this up a
moment ago, a few minutes ago,

00:25:29.410 --> 00:25:35.190 align:middle line:84%
talking about once you
change your thought process

00:25:35.190 --> 00:25:37.150 align:middle line:84%
or you make a decision
in the moment,

00:25:37.150 --> 00:25:39.960 align:middle line:84%
you've not just changed
your reality right now,

00:25:39.960 --> 00:25:42.420 align:middle line:84%
you've not just changed
your future, even if just

00:25:42.420 --> 00:25:45.250 align:middle line:84%
to a minor extent, but
you've changed your past.

00:25:45.250 --> 00:25:47.387 align:middle line:84%
People are intrigued
by this because you

00:25:47.387 --> 00:25:49.720 align:middle line:84%
do hear people saying, if I
can just do the right thing,

00:25:49.720 --> 00:25:53.620 align:middle line:84%
maybe I can heal my
family's ancestry.

00:25:53.620 --> 00:25:57.445 align:middle line:90%
So let's talk about that.

00:25:57.445 --> 00:25:59.560 align:middle line:84%
>>ANKA: The idea
stems from the notion

00:25:59.560 --> 00:26:04.530 align:middle line:84%
that now is all there is
when you ask what time is it.

00:26:04.530 --> 00:26:06.340 align:middle line:84%
Well, it doesn't
matter what you say.

00:26:06.340 --> 00:26:09.270 align:middle line:90%
It's always now.

00:26:09.270 --> 00:26:11.740 align:middle line:84%
So now is where
everything happens.

00:26:11.740 --> 00:26:14.800 align:middle line:84%
Now is where
everything is created.

00:26:14.800 --> 00:26:17.950 align:middle line:84%
From a linear space
time perspective,

00:26:17.950 --> 00:26:23.740 align:middle line:84%
if you change what you
are now, because we

00:26:23.740 --> 00:26:27.190 align:middle line:84%
need the sense of continuity
of what led up to this

00:26:27.190 --> 00:26:30.400 align:middle line:84%
and where this is
going, any time

00:26:30.400 --> 00:26:32.980 align:middle line:84%
you change the
definition of what

00:26:32.980 --> 00:26:39.380 align:middle line:84%
now is, you are changing the
now, the actual definition

00:26:39.380 --> 00:26:40.760 align:middle line:90%
of the now.

00:26:40.760 --> 00:26:44.930 align:middle line:84%
And by changing the definition
of the now, in order to make

00:26:44.930 --> 00:26:49.320 align:middle line:84%
sense of how this
now happened, you

00:26:49.320 --> 00:26:56.470 align:middle line:84%
have to create a path that makes
sense for that now to exist.

00:26:56.470 --> 00:27:00.310 align:middle line:84%
So that's why the path changes
when you change the present.

00:27:00.310 --> 00:27:03.990 align:middle line:84%
Because in linear perspective,
from a linear space time

00:27:03.990 --> 00:27:08.520 align:middle line:84%
reality, you have to have
something that led to this.

00:27:08.520 --> 00:27:12.570 align:middle line:84%
For us, it's very rare
that we can just go,

00:27:12.570 --> 00:27:14.640 align:middle line:84%
we can just have this
happen, and there's

00:27:14.640 --> 00:27:16.890 align:middle line:84%
no connection to
anything because we

00:27:16.890 --> 00:27:20.560 align:middle line:84%
are experiencing a physical,
linear, space time reality.

00:27:20.560 --> 00:27:23.770 align:middle line:84%
So it's not only
changing the future path

00:27:23.770 --> 00:27:25.120 align:middle line:90%
when you change the present.

00:27:25.120 --> 00:27:30.370 align:middle line:84%
It has to change the past as
well for the now to make sense,

00:27:30.370 --> 00:27:34.000 align:middle line:84%
for it to make sense as
to how it got this way.

00:27:34.000 --> 00:27:38.580 align:middle line:84%
Now the profound power
in understanding that,

00:27:38.580 --> 00:27:43.480 align:middle line:84%
and you use the example of,
well, maybe I can heal my past.

00:27:43.480 --> 00:27:47.340 align:middle line:84%
And I know this is a big step
for people's consciousness

00:27:47.340 --> 00:27:49.930 align:middle line:84%
in some ways because
of what they're used to

00:27:49.930 --> 00:27:51.710 align:middle line:90%
and thinking about causality.

00:27:51.710 --> 00:27:53.742 align:middle line:84%
And it's like, well,
this caused this.

00:27:53.742 --> 00:27:57.180 align:middle line:84%
This has to happen first
for this to happen.

00:27:57.180 --> 00:27:58.950 align:middle line:84%
The truth is that
when you really

00:27:58.950 --> 00:28:03.610 align:middle line:84%
understand that changing the
present changes the past,

00:28:03.610 --> 00:28:06.340 align:middle line:84%
then it's not even
an issue of let's say

00:28:06.340 --> 00:28:10.480 align:middle line:84%
you had an addiction
to whatever cigarettes.

00:28:10.480 --> 00:28:13.780 align:middle line:84%
And you really
change your present

00:28:13.780 --> 00:28:19.850 align:middle line:84%
sufficiently enough that the
addiction is not there anymore.

00:28:19.850 --> 00:28:23.430 align:middle line:84%
You don't have the
urge anymore to smoke.

00:28:23.430 --> 00:28:33.340 align:middle line:84%
It's not that you have learned
how to let go of the addiction.

00:28:33.340 --> 00:28:41.990 align:middle line:84%
The new person you are that has
no urge never had an addiction.

00:28:41.990 --> 00:28:46.150 align:middle line:84%
The past of a person who
doesn't have an addiction--

00:28:46.150 --> 00:28:48.150 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Doesn't have
that pattern in its past.

00:28:48.150 --> 00:28:49.692 align:middle line:84%
>>ANKA: It doesn't
have that pattern.

00:28:49.692 --> 00:28:51.510 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So it's not
just a perception.

00:28:51.510 --> 00:28:55.190 align:middle line:84%
You're saying that we actually
change reality itself rather

00:28:55.190 --> 00:28:57.730 align:middle line:90%
than our perception of reality.

00:28:57.730 --> 00:28:58.530 align:middle line:90%
>>ANKA: Yes.

00:28:58.530 --> 00:29:01.600 align:middle line:84%
Because our perception of
reality is what reality is.

00:29:01.600 --> 00:29:02.400 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: OK.

00:29:02.400 --> 00:29:04.020 align:middle line:90%
That's what I was trying to say.

00:29:04.020 --> 00:29:06.160 align:middle line:84%
>>ANKA: Because physical
reality isn't real.

00:29:06.160 --> 00:29:06.960 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:29:06.960 --> 00:29:07.920 align:middle line:90%
It's our perception.

00:29:07.920 --> 00:29:09.950 align:middle line:84%
>>ANKA: It's happening
within our consciousness.

00:29:09.950 --> 00:29:13.250 align:middle line:84%
This, as solid as it
feels, is happening

00:29:13.250 --> 00:29:14.292 align:middle line:90%
within our consciousness.

00:29:14.292 --> 00:29:15.092 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:29:15.092 --> 00:29:16.970 align:middle line:84%
>>ANKA: Now I think
a lot of leading edge

00:29:16.970 --> 00:29:20.300 align:middle line:84%
quantum physicists are
beginning to get this idea.

00:29:20.300 --> 00:29:24.170 align:middle line:84%
I know that a lot of them
balk at the concept of mixing

00:29:24.170 --> 00:29:29.490 align:middle line:84%
metaphysical ideas with physics,
but whether they like it or not,

00:29:29.490 --> 00:29:31.380 align:middle line:84%
I believe that's
where it's going,

00:29:31.380 --> 00:29:33.740 align:middle line:84%
and they're going to start
understanding that they

00:29:33.740 --> 00:29:37.340 align:middle line:84%
can actually have a
sufficient explanation

00:29:37.340 --> 00:29:40.070 align:middle line:84%
of metaphysical
concepts that satisfies

00:29:40.070 --> 00:29:44.430 align:middle line:84%
their understanding of physics
when they just simply turn

00:29:44.430 --> 00:29:47.760 align:middle line:84%
the corner a little bit and
allow for consciousness to be

00:29:47.760 --> 00:29:50.370 align:middle line:84%
involved in their
equations instead of trying

00:29:50.370 --> 00:29:52.770 align:middle line:90%
to extricate it.

00:29:52.770 --> 00:29:56.200 align:middle line:84%
Because this is all happening
within our consciousness,

00:29:56.200 --> 00:29:58.440 align:middle line:90%
no matter how solid it seems.

00:29:58.440 --> 00:30:01.130 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: I think Tom Campbell,
the physicist Tom Campbell did

00:30:01.130 --> 00:30:01.930 align:middle line:90%
a beautiful job.

00:30:01.930 --> 00:30:05.070 align:middle line:84%
He wrote a book quite a
while ago, 10, 15 years ago,

00:30:05.070 --> 00:30:07.600 align:middle line:84%
called "My Big TOE
(Theory Of Everything)."

00:30:07.600 --> 00:30:11.290 align:middle line:84%
And essentially, he's
doing exactly that.

00:30:11.290 --> 00:30:14.350 align:middle line:84%
He's saying, if you look
at this on an atomic level,

00:30:14.350 --> 00:30:15.540 align:middle line:90%
there's nothing there.

00:30:15.540 --> 00:30:16.140 align:middle line:84%
>>ANKA: There's
nothing there, yeah.

00:30:16.140 --> 00:30:18.150 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And that
this is a collectively

00:30:18.150 --> 00:30:21.840 align:middle line:84%
agreed upon rendering,
which when you think of it

00:30:21.840 --> 00:30:24.720 align:middle line:84%
in video terms, when a process
is happening where you're

00:30:24.720 --> 00:30:27.640 align:middle line:84%
rendering the final result
of pixels coming together,

00:30:27.640 --> 00:30:29.370 align:middle line:84%
rendering of reality,
and I thought

00:30:29.370 --> 00:30:32.340 align:middle line:84%
that was one of the most elegant
explanations from a physicist

00:30:32.340 --> 00:30:32.680 align:middle line:90%
ever.

00:30:32.680 --> 00:30:33.480 align:middle line:90%
>>ANKA: Right.

00:30:33.480 --> 00:30:37.840 align:middle line:84%
We rendering in real time
every moment, every moment.

00:30:37.840 --> 00:30:40.180 align:middle line:84%
This moment, this moment,
this moment, we are rendering.

00:30:40.180 --> 00:30:43.860 align:middle line:84%
And it's what we define
that render as that gives us

00:30:43.860 --> 00:30:45.150 align:middle line:90%
what we experience.

00:30:45.150 --> 00:30:49.650 align:middle line:84%
So we have the free will
to completely redefine

00:30:49.650 --> 00:30:53.003 align:middle line:84%
what this next moment is,
and that changes our past.

00:30:53.003 --> 00:30:53.920 align:middle line:90%
It changes everything.

00:30:53.920 --> 00:30:56.700 align:middle line:84%
It completely unlocks
us from thinking

00:30:56.700 --> 00:30:58.900 align:middle line:84%
that we're controlled
by the past,

00:30:58.900 --> 00:31:01.400 align:middle line:84%
that we have to keep repeating
the same thing over and over.

00:31:01.400 --> 00:31:03.275 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: That's what
I was going to bring up

00:31:03.275 --> 00:31:06.300 align:middle line:84%
is people who, there are many,
many, many, many huge percentage

00:31:06.300 --> 00:31:09.482 align:middle line:84%
of the population who are
kind of living in their past.

00:31:09.482 --> 00:31:10.440 align:middle line:90%
>>ANKA: Oh, absolutely.

00:31:10.440 --> 00:31:13.240 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Living past
projections, beliefs, fears.

00:31:13.240 --> 00:31:15.910 align:middle line:84%
And the story is all built
on what they remember,

00:31:15.910 --> 00:31:18.880 align:middle line:84%
that they think they
remember of their past.

00:31:18.880 --> 00:31:22.050 align:middle line:84%
What does this do to
stunt the joy that could

00:31:22.050 --> 00:31:24.440 align:middle line:90%
be happening in a human's life.

00:31:24.440 --> 00:31:26.190 align:middle line:84%
>>ANKA: Because the
thing of it is they're

00:31:26.190 --> 00:31:27.790 align:middle line:90%
not actually living in the past.

00:31:27.790 --> 00:31:28.680 align:middle line:90%
They're recreating--

00:31:28.680 --> 00:31:29.760 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: The past
by the moment.

00:31:29.760 --> 00:31:31.450 align:middle line:84%
>>ANKA: Every moment,
in the present.

00:31:31.450 --> 00:31:31.840 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:31:31.840 --> 00:31:34.048 align:middle line:84%
>>ANKA: But they're not
learning the lessons from it.

00:31:34.048 --> 00:31:37.690 align:middle line:84%
They're not understanding how
they can use that to serve them,

00:31:37.690 --> 00:31:40.210 align:middle line:84%
to move ahead, to
move on from it.

00:31:40.210 --> 00:31:42.460 align:middle line:84%
They're just sort of
wallowing in the same thing.

00:31:42.460 --> 00:31:47.530 align:middle line:84%
It's a very sort of victimhood,
poor me kind of mentality.

00:31:47.530 --> 00:31:49.950 align:middle line:84%
Because sometimes,
the way people

00:31:49.950 --> 00:31:54.220 align:middle line:84%
are given ideas,
given belief systems,

00:31:54.220 --> 00:31:59.280 align:middle line:84%
is if they don't understand that
they can attract what they need

00:31:59.280 --> 00:32:03.030 align:middle line:84%
in any other way, they
can take the victim route

00:32:03.030 --> 00:32:05.800 align:middle line:84%
because it's kind of
like, well, poor me.

00:32:05.800 --> 00:32:09.910 align:middle line:84%
Give me the attention I need,
but you're giving it to me

00:32:09.910 --> 00:32:12.040 align:middle line:84%
as a victim because
I can't imagine

00:32:12.040 --> 00:32:15.850 align:middle line:84%
how you would give it to me
as a self-empowered being.

00:32:15.850 --> 00:32:19.730 align:middle line:84%
So they use the victimhood
to get attention,

00:32:19.730 --> 00:32:22.180 align:middle line:84%
to make themselves feel
like they're there,

00:32:22.180 --> 00:32:25.360 align:middle line:84%
like they're noticed, they're
loved, they're cared for.

00:32:25.360 --> 00:32:28.620 align:middle line:84%
But that can happen from
a very different position.

00:32:28.620 --> 00:32:30.260 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes, yes, indeed.

00:32:30.260 --> 00:32:32.710 align:middle line:84%
>>ANKA: And they have to
learn that lesson, that

00:32:32.710 --> 00:32:36.310 align:middle line:84%
having had that
experience, recreating

00:32:36.310 --> 00:32:39.130 align:middle line:84%
that more negative
way of doing it is not

00:32:39.130 --> 00:32:41.590 align:middle line:84%
something that has to keep
being perpetuated by them.

00:32:41.590 --> 00:32:44.770 align:middle line:84%
It's there to let
them, look, if you

00:32:44.770 --> 00:32:46.780 align:middle line:84%
don't prefer this
when you really

00:32:46.780 --> 00:32:49.660 align:middle line:84%
get down deep inside yourself
and you understand this is not

00:32:49.660 --> 00:32:53.620 align:middle line:84%
really the way you want to
continue to be or to live, then

00:32:53.620 --> 00:32:57.730 align:middle line:84%
understand that this is being
given to you to show you

00:32:57.730 --> 00:33:00.550 align:middle line:84%
what you don't prefer, so
that by contrast, you can

00:33:00.550 --> 00:33:03.310 align:middle line:90%
understand what you do prefer.

00:33:03.310 --> 00:33:05.970 align:middle line:84%
Now the hitch is
that in our society,

00:33:05.970 --> 00:33:09.680 align:middle line:84%
they're not necessarily
taught how to do it in a way

00:33:09.680 --> 00:33:10.540 align:middle line:90%
that they prefer.

00:33:10.540 --> 00:33:12.380 align:middle line:90%
They don't have the tool kit.

00:33:12.380 --> 00:33:15.230 align:middle line:84%
That's what I like about
Bashar's information.

00:33:15.230 --> 00:33:20.300 align:middle line:84%
He is a being that understands
we have physical reality

00:33:20.300 --> 00:33:21.240 align:middle line:90%
experience.

00:33:21.240 --> 00:33:24.320 align:middle line:84%
We need physical tools that
make a physical difference

00:33:24.320 --> 00:33:25.940 align:middle line:90%
in our physical reality.

00:33:25.940 --> 00:33:27.920 align:middle line:84%
And so he gives
it to us literally

00:33:27.920 --> 00:33:29.840 align:middle line:90%
as an instruction manual.

00:33:29.840 --> 00:33:31.910 align:middle line:84%
It's just like an
instruction manual

00:33:31.910 --> 00:33:34.400 align:middle line:84%
that you would use to
operate a piece of machinery.

00:33:34.400 --> 00:33:36.950 align:middle line:84%
If you follow the
instructions, the machine

00:33:36.950 --> 00:33:39.680 align:middle line:84%
will work as advertised
to your advantage.

00:33:39.680 --> 00:33:41.850 align:middle line:84%
If you don't, the
machine may work,

00:33:41.850 --> 00:33:43.790 align:middle line:84%
but you could injure
yourself because it's not

00:33:43.790 --> 00:33:45.260 align:middle line:90%
working to your advantage.

00:33:45.260 --> 00:33:48.290 align:middle line:84%
So he says, look, here
are the simple steps.

00:33:48.290 --> 00:33:50.840 align:middle line:84%
Just follow them,
and you will find

00:33:50.840 --> 00:33:52.890 align:middle line:84%
that when you apply
this information,

00:33:52.890 --> 00:33:54.650 align:middle line:84%
everything will start
falling into place

00:33:54.650 --> 00:33:57.900 align:middle line:84%
because that's the
way it is built to be.

00:33:57.900 --> 00:34:00.300 align:middle line:84%
But if you don't
have that tool kit,

00:34:00.300 --> 00:34:02.900 align:middle line:84%
if you don't have that
understanding of how you're

00:34:02.900 --> 00:34:07.020 align:middle line:84%
already creating your reality
in the negative sense,

00:34:07.020 --> 00:34:09.889 align:middle line:84%
then you don't understand
how to change that

00:34:09.889 --> 00:34:12.530 align:middle line:84%
into creating your reality
in the positive sense.

00:34:12.530 --> 00:34:14.120 align:middle line:90%
You're just doing it blindly.

00:34:14.120 --> 00:34:16.310 align:middle line:84%
It's just like trying to
get the parts of a machine

00:34:16.310 --> 00:34:18.918 align:middle line:84%
to fit together, and you don't
have any instruction manual.

00:34:18.918 --> 00:34:20.210 align:middle line:90%
You don't know what goes where.

00:34:20.210 --> 00:34:21.710 align:middle line:84%
You don't know where
the screws fit.

00:34:21.710 --> 00:34:24.139 align:middle line:84%
And you're left with
five bolts left over,

00:34:24.139 --> 00:34:25.550 align:middle line:90%
and you go, where do those go?

00:34:25.550 --> 00:34:27.780 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Like when I
assembled a bicycle for my son.

00:34:27.780 --> 00:34:29.449 align:middle line:90%
>>ANKA: Exactly.

00:34:29.449 --> 00:34:32.100 align:middle line:84%
But he gives us
exactly those steps.

00:34:32.100 --> 00:34:35.800 align:middle line:84%
And every single time you
follow them, and I've had this.

00:34:35.800 --> 00:34:37.550 align:middle line:84%
And it's one of the
reasons why I continue

00:34:37.550 --> 00:34:40.420 align:middle line:84%
to do the channelings, because
people keep coming up and go,

00:34:40.420 --> 00:34:41.330 align:middle line:90%
you know what?

00:34:41.330 --> 00:34:44.150 align:middle line:84%
It took me a while to get
it, but when I finally

00:34:44.150 --> 00:34:47.480 align:middle line:84%
understood how to use the
instruction manual, the formula,

00:34:47.480 --> 00:34:52.370 align:middle line:84%
he calls it precisely, cleanly,
with not adding anything, not

00:34:52.370 --> 00:34:53.760 align:middle line:90%
taking anything away.

00:34:53.760 --> 00:34:57.870 align:middle line:84%
Full understanding, and I really
applied it, everything changed.

00:34:57.870 --> 00:34:59.210 align:middle line:90%
My life got better.

00:34:59.210 --> 00:35:00.390 align:middle line:90%
Everything improved.

00:35:00.390 --> 00:35:03.600 align:middle line:84%
It got more creative, it got
more loving, more positive.

00:35:03.600 --> 00:35:08.630 align:middle line:84%
So the feedback that I get from
people that know how to apply it

00:35:08.630 --> 00:35:12.003 align:middle line:84%
keeps me doing this because I
know it's making a difference.

00:35:12.003 --> 00:35:13.170 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: It's so important.

00:35:13.170 --> 00:35:13.855 align:middle line:90%
Absolutely.

00:35:13.855 --> 00:35:14.730 align:middle line:84%
>>ANKA: It's making
a difference.

00:35:14.730 --> 00:35:16.490 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And we need to have
some compassion for each other

00:35:16.490 --> 00:35:17.000 align:middle line:90%
too.

00:35:17.000 --> 00:35:17.390 align:middle line:90%
>>ANKA: Absolutely.

00:35:17.390 --> 00:35:20.040 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: When we're trying to
talk about our history together,

00:35:20.040 --> 00:35:22.100 align:middle line:84%
our shared, quote,
shared history,

00:35:22.100 --> 00:35:23.960 align:middle line:84%
our remembered
history, when someone's

00:35:23.960 --> 00:35:27.005 align:middle line:84%
saying that is not what
happened, what happened is this.

00:35:27.005 --> 00:35:30.650 align:middle line:84%
This is happening all over the
world in every venue possible,

00:35:30.650 --> 00:35:32.900 align:middle line:90%
from home to Capitol Hill.

00:35:32.900 --> 00:35:36.350 align:middle line:84%
Because we are having
different remembrances of what

00:35:36.350 --> 00:35:39.425 align:middle line:84%
happened, depending on what our
perception was at that time.

00:35:39.425 --> 00:35:41.550 align:middle line:84%
>>ANKA: And that's OK
because they can all be real,

00:35:41.550 --> 00:35:44.850 align:middle line:84%
but that's what opens us up to
the idea of, hey, you know what.

00:35:44.850 --> 00:35:47.840 align:middle line:84%
If these are all
real histories, what

00:35:47.840 --> 00:35:50.460 align:middle line:84%
does that say about the
nature of existence?

00:35:50.460 --> 00:35:52.400 align:middle line:84%
And then it leads
you into the idea

00:35:52.400 --> 00:35:55.250 align:middle line:84%
that there are multiverses,
parallel realities,

00:35:55.250 --> 00:35:57.500 align:middle line:84%
different paths that
people can take,

00:35:57.500 --> 00:36:00.300 align:middle line:84%
but they all exist
within existence.

00:36:00.300 --> 00:36:01.920 align:middle line:90%
They're all valid paths.

00:36:01.920 --> 00:36:04.820 align:middle line:84%
And we can learn different
things from the fact

00:36:04.820 --> 00:36:07.450 align:middle line:84%
that somebody may remember a
different history than someone

00:36:07.450 --> 00:36:08.250 align:middle line:90%
else.

00:36:08.250 --> 00:36:10.770 align:middle line:84%
We can look at that and
go, this is fascinating.

00:36:10.770 --> 00:36:11.850 align:middle line:90%
Why is this happening?

00:36:11.850 --> 00:36:13.475 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So what's
the touchstone then

00:36:13.475 --> 00:36:16.730 align:middle line:84%
because a lot of people hear
this that aren't already there

00:36:16.730 --> 00:36:19.140 align:middle line:84%
but want to go there
and are thinking,

00:36:19.140 --> 00:36:21.240 align:middle line:84%
wow, that's way
too fluid for me.

00:36:21.240 --> 00:36:22.530 align:middle line:90%
What's real anyway?

00:36:22.530 --> 00:36:24.180 align:middle line:90%
I mean, this whole thing.

00:36:24.180 --> 00:36:24.980 align:middle line:90%
>>ANKA: Exactly.

00:36:24.980 --> 00:36:25.670 align:middle line:90%
What's real?

00:36:25.670 --> 00:36:26.878 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: What's real anyway?

00:36:26.878 --> 00:36:31.670 align:middle line:84%
And so what is the touchstone as
a soul inhabiting a human body

00:36:31.670 --> 00:36:33.160 align:middle line:90%
to play this game correctly?

00:36:33.160 --> 00:36:33.960 align:middle line:90%
>>ANKA: OK.

00:36:33.960 --> 00:36:37.220 align:middle line:84%
I'm going to reverse that
a little bit because that's

00:36:37.220 --> 00:36:40.490 align:middle line:84%
the habit we're in because we
come from physical linear space

00:36:40.490 --> 00:36:41.600 align:middle line:90%
time thinking.

00:36:41.600 --> 00:36:44.820 align:middle line:90%
We don't have a soul.

00:36:44.820 --> 00:36:47.280 align:middle line:90%
Our body does not have a soul.

00:36:47.280 --> 00:36:48.290 align:middle line:90%
Our soul--

00:36:48.290 --> 00:36:49.380 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Has a body.

00:36:49.380 --> 00:36:50.180 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

00:36:50.180 --> 00:36:50.990 align:middle line:90%
>>ANKA: OK.

00:36:50.990 --> 00:36:53.160 align:middle line:90%
The soul is where we are.

00:36:53.160 --> 00:36:55.940 align:middle line:90%
It's where we are right now.

00:36:55.940 --> 00:36:58.890 align:middle line:84%
Non-physical reality
is our natural state.

00:36:58.890 --> 00:37:00.140 align:middle line:90%
We never leave it.

00:37:00.140 --> 00:37:01.320 align:middle line:90%
We're there right now.

00:37:01.320 --> 00:37:03.630 align:middle line:90%
We're pretending that we're not.

00:37:03.630 --> 00:37:08.520 align:middle line:84%
So your soul, my soul are
having this conversation

00:37:08.520 --> 00:37:12.150 align:middle line:84%
on a different level, but
we're creating the illusion

00:37:12.150 --> 00:37:14.940 align:middle line:84%
that we have somehow
separated from spirit

00:37:14.940 --> 00:37:18.970 align:middle line:84%
and have these little nuggets
we call physical personalities.

00:37:18.970 --> 00:37:22.590 align:middle line:84%
And we're communicating through
those physical personalities.

00:37:22.590 --> 00:37:25.660 align:middle line:84%
But really, our souls are
communicating right now,

00:37:25.660 --> 00:37:28.860 align:middle line:84%
and we're having this shared
experience that, yes, we agree,

00:37:28.860 --> 00:37:30.430 align:middle line:90%
we're in a physical reality.

00:37:30.430 --> 00:37:33.030 align:middle line:84%
We're creating this illusion
for our own purposes,

00:37:33.030 --> 00:37:35.010 align:middle line:84%
to discover something
new about ourselves

00:37:35.010 --> 00:37:38.710 align:middle line:84%
from a different perspective,
to aid in our soul's growth,

00:37:38.710 --> 00:37:40.720 align:middle line:84%
in having these
different experiences,

00:37:40.720 --> 00:37:44.280 align:middle line:84%
different perspectives,
different points of view.

00:37:44.280 --> 00:37:47.140 align:middle line:84%
But we have to remember,
and this is the touchstone,

00:37:47.140 --> 00:37:50.710 align:middle line:84%
we have to remember that
it all starts there.

00:37:50.710 --> 00:37:54.030 align:middle line:84%
And it filters down to
here, to whatever degree

00:37:54.030 --> 00:37:56.670 align:middle line:84%
we believe we need
it to so in order

00:37:56.670 --> 00:38:02.260 align:middle line:84%
to have this process, this
discovery process of space,

00:38:02.260 --> 00:38:04.400 align:middle line:90%
and time, and change.

00:38:04.400 --> 00:38:07.810 align:middle line:84%
Because remember, in a timeless
state, nothing changes.

00:38:07.810 --> 00:38:09.580 align:middle line:84%
So the only way
you can experience

00:38:09.580 --> 00:38:12.830 align:middle line:84%
the creation of change,
the process of change,

00:38:12.830 --> 00:38:15.310 align:middle line:84%
discovering something
new is to forget

00:38:15.310 --> 00:38:19.180 align:middle line:84%
who you were as this
bigger soul and start

00:38:19.180 --> 00:38:22.630 align:middle line:84%
trying to remember who you
are through this experience

00:38:22.630 --> 00:38:25.970 align:middle line:84%
of discovery and
revelation of yourself.

00:38:25.970 --> 00:38:27.710 align:middle line:84%
And then that's how
the soul is growing.

00:38:27.710 --> 00:38:31.060 align:middle line:84%
Because the structure of
existence itself never changes.

00:38:31.060 --> 00:38:32.110 align:middle line:90%
It is what it is.

00:38:32.110 --> 00:38:35.240 align:middle line:84%
It's our perspective of
it, our experience of it,

00:38:35.240 --> 00:38:37.400 align:middle line:84%
our point of view
of it that changes.

00:38:37.400 --> 00:38:39.730 align:middle line:84%
And that's how
creation expands, is

00:38:39.730 --> 00:38:43.090 align:middle line:84%
through these experiences,
these experiences of discovery,

00:38:43.090 --> 00:38:45.910 align:middle line:84%
and sharing, and
exchanging, ideas

00:38:45.910 --> 00:38:48.140 align:middle line:84%
and saying, I can look
at reality this way,

00:38:48.140 --> 00:38:51.260 align:middle line:84%
and that's just as real as
looking at reality that way.

00:38:51.260 --> 00:38:52.550 align:middle line:90%
Which do we prefer?

00:38:52.550 --> 00:38:54.130 align:middle line:90%
What serves us better?

00:38:54.130 --> 00:38:56.890 align:middle line:84%
Can we come to any kind
of a consensus agreement

00:38:56.890 --> 00:39:00.420 align:middle line:84%
about where we want to go,
what we want to experience,

00:39:00.420 --> 00:39:04.070 align:middle line:84%
why we're choosing
to be here, and what

00:39:04.070 --> 00:39:07.835 align:middle line:84%
we're learning from this about
ourselves and about creation?

00:39:07.835 --> 00:39:09.710 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Well, this
is-- thank you for that.

00:39:09.710 --> 00:39:11.310 align:middle line:90%
Beautiful explanation.

00:39:11.310 --> 00:39:15.260 align:middle line:84%
And this is why I'm particularly
perturbed these days because

00:39:15.260 --> 00:39:17.570 align:middle line:84%
of one particular
book, but I see

00:39:17.570 --> 00:39:20.610 align:middle line:84%
that there are a few out
there now on the subject.

00:39:20.610 --> 00:39:23.960 align:middle line:84%
One of them is by a
professor out of Stanford

00:39:23.960 --> 00:39:27.050 align:middle line:84%
in neurosciences, and his
book is called "Determine,

00:39:27.050 --> 00:39:29.930 align:middle line:84%
The Science of Life
with No Free Will."

00:39:29.930 --> 00:39:34.080 align:middle line:84%
Now why are these
popping up now?

00:39:34.080 --> 00:39:36.980 align:middle line:84%
This is, to me, it really
kind of ticks me off

00:39:36.980 --> 00:39:39.540 align:middle line:84%
because essentially,
do what you want.

00:39:39.540 --> 00:39:42.260 align:middle line:84%
He murdered someone because he's
programmed to murder someone.

00:39:42.260 --> 00:39:43.890 align:middle line:84%
Nothing he could have
done to avoid it.

00:39:43.890 --> 00:39:44.150 align:middle line:90%
>>ANKA: Yeah.

00:39:44.150 --> 00:39:45.800 align:middle line:84%
So in a sense,
what he's saying is

00:39:45.800 --> 00:39:47.330 align:middle line:84%
he was programmed
to write that book

00:39:47.330 --> 00:39:48.740 align:middle line:90%
because he has no free will.

00:39:48.740 --> 00:39:49.540 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:39:49.540 --> 00:39:50.390 align:middle line:90%
And he'll say that.

00:39:50.390 --> 00:39:52.730 align:middle line:84%
It was a revelation
at the age of 13

00:39:52.730 --> 00:39:55.610 align:middle line:84%
that there is nothing
else except whatever

00:39:55.610 --> 00:39:57.450 align:middle line:84%
your neurochemical
responses are,

00:39:57.450 --> 00:39:59.790 align:middle line:84%
that you were born
with, conditioned into,

00:39:59.790 --> 00:40:02.010 align:middle line:84%
and everything you do
has been chosen already.

00:40:02.010 --> 00:40:04.700 align:middle line:84%
>>ANKA: The thing of it is,
is that materialistic argument

00:40:04.700 --> 00:40:06.030 align:middle line:90%
is self-canceling.

00:40:06.030 --> 00:40:08.070 align:middle line:84%
And that's what
they don't see yet.

00:40:08.070 --> 00:40:10.940 align:middle line:84%
Because if it's true that
there is absolutely no free

00:40:10.940 --> 00:40:14.390 align:middle line:84%
will and the idea of
whatever it is you do

00:40:14.390 --> 00:40:19.820 align:middle line:84%
is just sort of a random
act with no reason, rhyme,

00:40:19.820 --> 00:40:23.790 align:middle line:84%
or anything, why should
we listen to your opinion?

00:40:23.790 --> 00:40:25.290 align:middle line:90%
Your opinion means nothing.

00:40:25.290 --> 00:40:27.800 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Do you know all
the press picked his book up?

00:40:27.800 --> 00:40:29.400 align:middle line:84%
All the major
press picked it up.

00:40:29.400 --> 00:40:32.540 align:middle line:84%
You don't see that on the
subject of you have free will.

00:40:32.540 --> 00:40:34.080 align:middle line:90%
You are creating your reality.

00:40:34.080 --> 00:40:36.840 align:middle line:84%
They don't pick that up except
for maybe Popular Mechanics.

00:40:36.840 --> 00:40:38.760 align:middle line:84%
>>ANKA: Well, it's
radical in a sense.

00:40:38.760 --> 00:40:41.930 align:middle line:84%
But the idea is people
are groping for something

00:40:41.930 --> 00:40:44.130 align:middle line:90%
to explain things to them.

00:40:44.130 --> 00:40:46.850 align:middle line:84%
And the idea that
everything is predestined

00:40:46.850 --> 00:40:50.360 align:middle line:84%
may seem to some
people like, OK, then I

00:40:50.360 --> 00:40:52.920 align:middle line:84%
can understand how things
go from here to there.

00:40:52.920 --> 00:40:56.850 align:middle line:84%
It makes life understandable
to them on that level.

00:40:56.850 --> 00:41:00.790 align:middle line:84%
But again, the idea of a
total materialist random thing

00:41:00.790 --> 00:41:03.130 align:middle line:84%
with no rhyme or reason
behind it and no free will

00:41:03.130 --> 00:41:04.690 align:middle line:90%
is self-canceling.

00:41:04.690 --> 00:41:07.900 align:middle line:84%
Because if it is true,
then why should anybody

00:41:07.900 --> 00:41:09.150 align:middle line:90%
listen to any opinion--

00:41:09.150 --> 00:41:10.150 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Why incarnate?

00:41:10.150 --> 00:41:12.080 align:middle line:84%
>>ANKA: Well, it's
not even that.

00:41:12.080 --> 00:41:15.160 align:middle line:84%
I just mean in physical
reality, if you're

00:41:15.160 --> 00:41:19.110 align:middle line:84%
predestined to say x, then
you're just predestined

00:41:19.110 --> 00:41:21.813 align:middle line:84%
to say x, and it has absolutely
no meaning to it whatsoever.

00:41:21.813 --> 00:41:22.980 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: You're programmed.

00:41:22.980 --> 00:41:25.000 align:middle line:84%
>>ANKA: Therefore,
why should we see--

00:41:25.000 --> 00:41:27.292 align:middle line:84%
That's what I'm saying it's
self-canceling in the sense

00:41:27.292 --> 00:41:29.190 align:middle line:90%
of saying we have no free will.

00:41:29.190 --> 00:41:34.530 align:middle line:84%
But if you had no free will
to say that, why should

00:41:34.530 --> 00:41:37.410 align:middle line:84%
I believe that we
have no free will?

00:41:37.410 --> 00:41:40.180 align:middle line:84%
Because you were
programmed to say that.

00:41:40.180 --> 00:41:45.440 align:middle line:84%
And therefore, I have no way of
knowing that what you're saying

00:41:45.440 --> 00:41:47.480 align:middle line:90%
means anything at all.

00:41:47.480 --> 00:41:49.940 align:middle line:84%
Your opinion doesn't
matter because it

00:41:49.940 --> 00:41:54.950 align:middle line:84%
didn't come from a
reasoned idea of choice

00:41:54.950 --> 00:41:58.100 align:middle line:84%
that you made to decide that
this was something you wanted

00:41:58.100 --> 00:42:01.880 align:middle line:84%
to say, which then has meaning
to it from your perspective

00:42:01.880 --> 00:42:03.680 align:middle line:90%
about what life can be like.

00:42:03.680 --> 00:42:07.290 align:middle line:84%
So if you're saying that you
had no choice but to do that,

00:42:07.290 --> 00:42:10.130 align:middle line:84%
then there's no reason for
me to believe you or listen

00:42:10.130 --> 00:42:13.307 align:middle line:84%
to you because it
doesn't mean anything.

00:42:13.307 --> 00:42:15.140 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Well, it was
certainly sexy enough

00:42:15.140 --> 00:42:17.837 align:middle line:84%
that the media industry
enjoyed picking up on that.

00:42:17.837 --> 00:42:19.920 align:middle line:84%
>>ANKA: But then that
doesn't mean anything either

00:42:19.920 --> 00:42:20.730 align:middle line:90%
according to him.

00:42:20.730 --> 00:42:21.390 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: It does not.

00:42:21.390 --> 00:42:23.310 align:middle line:84%
>>ANKA: And yet I'm sure he's
taking advantage of that.

00:42:23.310 --> 00:42:25.200 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Yes, he
is, for book sales.

00:42:25.200 --> 00:42:26.000 align:middle line:90%
It's selling.

00:42:26.000 --> 00:42:26.800 align:middle line:90%
>>ANKA: Exactly.

00:42:26.800 --> 00:42:28.470 align:middle line:84%
And I suppose that
was predestined too.

00:42:28.470 --> 00:42:29.303 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Of course.

00:42:29.303 --> 00:42:31.680 align:middle line:84%
>>ANKA: But again,
there's no meaning to it

00:42:31.680 --> 00:42:33.270 align:middle line:90%
because it was predestined.

00:42:33.270 --> 00:42:36.410 align:middle line:84%
So I don't have to
listen to the opinion

00:42:36.410 --> 00:42:37.922 align:middle line:90%
because it's self-canceling.

00:42:37.922 --> 00:42:39.630 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: It's a very
good way to put it.

00:42:39.630 --> 00:42:41.630 align:middle line:84%
So Cynthia Sue Larson,
who you may know of,

00:42:41.630 --> 00:42:44.200 align:middle line:84%
I don't know, but she deals a
lot with the Mandela effect.

00:42:44.200 --> 00:42:45.780 align:middle line:90%
She's in the world of science.

00:42:45.780 --> 00:42:48.660 align:middle line:84%
There's some things she says
that I think is actually

00:42:48.660 --> 00:42:51.990 align:middle line:84%
really sweet and wonderful
that goes with what you say,

00:42:51.990 --> 00:42:54.200 align:middle line:84%
and maybe you can
just expand on it.

00:42:54.200 --> 00:42:58.240 align:middle line:84%
She says, when I wake up,
I ask myself each day,

00:42:58.240 --> 00:43:03.390 align:middle line:84%
how good can it get in her
creative process of life?

00:43:03.390 --> 00:43:05.140 align:middle line:90%
>>ANKA: It can become ecstatic.

00:43:05.140 --> 00:43:08.650 align:middle line:84%
Every moment can be an ecstatic
explosion of synchronicity.

00:43:08.650 --> 00:43:10.580 align:middle line:84%
You just have to
give way to that.

00:43:10.580 --> 00:43:11.830 align:middle line:90%
Now, will there be challenges?

00:43:11.830 --> 00:43:12.780 align:middle line:90%
Absolutely.

00:43:12.780 --> 00:43:15.360 align:middle line:84%
But why define a challenge
in a negative way?

00:43:15.360 --> 00:43:16.840 align:middle line:90%
That's what helps us grow.

00:43:16.840 --> 00:43:19.050 align:middle line:84%
>>ANKA: So what I
think really needs

00:43:19.050 --> 00:43:22.750 align:middle line:84%
to come out of people to face
those challenges is curiosity.

00:43:22.750 --> 00:43:23.550 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:43:23.550 --> 00:43:24.350 align:middle line:90%
>>ANKA: Oh.

00:43:24.350 --> 00:43:25.490 align:middle line:90%
Why did that happen?

00:43:25.490 --> 00:43:28.030 align:middle line:84%
What's that going to
lead me to discover?

00:43:28.030 --> 00:43:30.630 align:middle line:84%
What am I going to find out
by walking down that path

00:43:30.630 --> 00:43:32.280 align:middle line:90%
or facing this challenge?

00:43:32.280 --> 00:43:33.695 align:middle line:90%
Who knows?

00:43:33.695 --> 00:43:37.510 align:middle line:84%
They need more of that
curiosity to follow that path.

00:43:37.510 --> 00:43:39.760 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Even the stuff
that's heavy and challenging.

00:43:39.760 --> 00:43:41.260 align:middle line:84%
>>ANKA: But see,
the thing of it is,

00:43:41.260 --> 00:43:46.450 align:middle line:84%
is a lot of that doesn't really
get heavy unless they resist it,

00:43:46.450 --> 00:43:48.510 align:middle line:84%
unless they define
it as something

00:43:48.510 --> 00:43:49.650 align:middle line:90%
that's going to be heavy.

00:43:49.650 --> 00:43:50.790 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Or unless
they have self judgment

00:43:50.790 --> 00:43:51.880 align:middle line:90%
of what they'll discover.

00:43:51.880 --> 00:43:52.810 align:middle line:90%
>>ANKA: But that's resistance.

00:43:52.810 --> 00:43:53.110 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:43:53.110 --> 00:43:54.480 align:middle line:90%
That is part of resistance.

00:43:54.480 --> 00:43:56.760 align:middle line:84%
>>ANKA: So according
to Bashar, pain

00:43:56.760 --> 00:43:59.940 align:middle line:84%
is resistance to
the natural self.

00:43:59.940 --> 00:44:01.660 align:middle line:90%
That's what all pain is from.

00:44:01.660 --> 00:44:06.870 align:middle line:84%
So if you have that
definition that starts it out

00:44:06.870 --> 00:44:11.140 align:middle line:84%
as this is going to be a slog,
this is going to be difficult,

00:44:11.140 --> 00:44:13.630 align:middle line:84%
then that's the way you're
going to experience it,

00:44:13.630 --> 00:44:15.190 align:middle line:84%
because you've
defined it that way.

00:44:15.190 --> 00:44:17.100 align:middle line:84%
Because remember,
you're in control

00:44:17.100 --> 00:44:18.820 align:middle line:90%
of how you experience things.

00:44:18.820 --> 00:44:20.760 align:middle line:90%
Again, that's your free will.

00:44:20.760 --> 00:44:25.210 align:middle line:84%
So the universe doesn't
have a mind of its own.

00:44:25.210 --> 00:44:26.840 align:middle line:90%
You're in charge.

00:44:26.840 --> 00:44:29.510 align:middle line:84%
The universe is
unconditionally supportive.

00:44:29.510 --> 00:44:31.000 align:middle line:90%
Unconditionally.

00:44:31.000 --> 00:44:32.930 align:middle line:84%
So if you say this is
going to be difficult,

00:44:32.930 --> 00:44:34.310 align:middle line:90%
the universe says, OK.

00:44:34.310 --> 00:44:37.590 align:middle line:84%
It's going to be difficult. I
will support you in that belief.

00:44:37.590 --> 00:44:39.680 align:middle line:84%
If you say, this
is going to be fun,

00:44:39.680 --> 00:44:42.730 align:middle line:84%
the universe is also going to
say, OK, it's going to be fun,

00:44:42.730 --> 00:44:44.600 align:middle line:84%
and I will support
you in that belief.

00:44:44.600 --> 00:44:46.900 align:middle line:84%
We don't understand
that we're the ones that

00:44:46.900 --> 00:44:48.740 align:middle line:90%
give meaning to life.

00:44:48.740 --> 00:44:52.060 align:middle line:84%
Life by itself, I don't
mean this in a negative way,

00:44:52.060 --> 00:44:53.820 align:middle line:90%
is meaningless.

00:44:53.820 --> 00:44:57.090 align:middle line:84%
It doesn't have built in
meaning is what that means.

00:44:57.090 --> 00:44:59.430 align:middle line:84%
So we decide what
the meaning is,

00:44:59.430 --> 00:45:02.830 align:middle line:84%
and the meaning we give it
determines how we experience it,

00:45:02.830 --> 00:45:05.310 align:middle line:84%
and that should be the proof
of free will right there,

00:45:05.310 --> 00:45:08.940 align:middle line:84%
is if you decide that something
is going to be experienced

00:45:08.940 --> 00:45:11.440 align:middle line:90%
negatively, absolutely.

00:45:11.440 --> 00:45:13.450 align:middle line:84%
That's the way you're
going to experience it.

00:45:13.450 --> 00:45:15.270 align:middle line:84%
But if you change
your mind and say,

00:45:15.270 --> 00:45:17.970 align:middle line:84%
you know what, I'd
rather experience it

00:45:17.970 --> 00:45:20.730 align:middle line:84%
this way, that's the
way you will suddenly

00:45:20.730 --> 00:45:22.470 align:middle line:90%
start to experience it.

00:45:22.470 --> 00:45:27.020 align:middle line:84%
The fact that you can switch
back and forth at will.

00:45:27.020 --> 00:45:27.840 align:middle line:90%
I'm negative now.

00:45:27.840 --> 00:45:28.640 align:middle line:90%
I'm positive now.

00:45:28.640 --> 00:45:29.450 align:middle line:90%
I'm negative now.

00:45:29.450 --> 00:45:30.240 align:middle line:90%
I'm neutral.

00:45:30.240 --> 00:45:30.950 align:middle line:90%
I'm positive now.

00:45:30.950 --> 00:45:31.750 align:middle line:90%
I'm neutral.

00:45:31.750 --> 00:45:32.600 align:middle line:90%
I'm negative now.

00:45:32.600 --> 00:45:34.890 align:middle line:84%
The fact that you
have that broad range.

00:45:34.890 --> 00:45:37.718 align:middle line:84%
If you want to say that's all
predetermined, well, then fine

00:45:37.718 --> 00:45:39.260 align:middle line:84%
because you're still
having that kind

00:45:39.260 --> 00:45:42.990 align:middle line:84%
of an experience of flexibility
within your predetermination.

00:45:42.990 --> 00:45:44.690 align:middle line:84%
So it might as
well be free will.

00:45:44.690 --> 00:45:45.490 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:45:45.490 --> 00:45:48.140 align:middle line:84%
>>ANKA: But the idea really
is do have the choice

00:45:48.140 --> 00:45:51.990 align:middle line:84%
to go one way or the other or
stay in balance in the center,

00:45:51.990 --> 00:45:53.840 align:middle line:84%
knowing you can always
choose the negative

00:45:53.840 --> 00:45:56.190 align:middle line:84%
if you want because it's
always going to be there,

00:45:56.190 --> 00:45:57.620 align:middle line:90%
but I prefer this.

00:45:57.620 --> 00:45:59.460 align:middle line:84%
And that's what you're
going to experience.

00:45:59.460 --> 00:46:01.530 align:middle line:90%
So challenges, yes.

00:46:01.530 --> 00:46:03.900 align:middle line:84%
Let's do it because
this could be fun.

00:46:03.900 --> 00:46:06.470 align:middle line:84%
I'm curious to find out
where this is leading.

00:46:06.470 --> 00:46:10.380 align:middle line:84%
If I didn't say that in
the channeling class,

00:46:10.380 --> 00:46:12.440 align:middle line:84%
I wouldn't be here
today, and I wouldn't

00:46:12.440 --> 00:46:13.890 align:middle line:90%
have had all these experiences.

00:46:13.890 --> 00:46:16.190 align:middle line:84%
I wouldn't have been meeting
these interesting people

00:46:16.190 --> 00:46:18.860 align:middle line:84%
like yourself who are doing
these things that allow

00:46:18.860 --> 00:46:20.750 align:middle line:90%
this information to spread.

00:46:20.750 --> 00:46:23.120 align:middle line:84%
I wouldn't have had
the life that I've had.

00:46:23.120 --> 00:46:24.870 align:middle line:84%
I could have chosen
something else,

00:46:24.870 --> 00:46:28.560 align:middle line:84%
but I absolutely know that
if it wasn't representative

00:46:28.560 --> 00:46:32.140 align:middle line:84%
of my passion, I would not
be a happy camper today.

00:46:32.140 --> 00:46:34.180 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Absolutely.

00:46:34.180 --> 00:46:36.820 align:middle line:84%
It seems like we just started,
but we're already out of time.

00:46:36.820 --> 00:46:39.900 align:middle line:84%
Any final thoughts we must
get in before we say goodbye?

00:46:39.900 --> 00:46:42.240 align:middle line:84%
>>ANKA: It's so
important to understand

00:46:42.240 --> 00:46:48.100 align:middle line:84%
that what we're describing
again as passion, as curiosity,

00:46:48.100 --> 00:46:52.750 align:middle line:84%
as attraction, is the message
from your soul telling you,

00:46:52.750 --> 00:46:54.850 align:middle line:90%
look, this is who you are.

00:46:54.850 --> 00:46:56.500 align:middle line:90%
This is your next step.

00:46:56.500 --> 00:46:58.420 align:middle line:84%
It's doing its
best to guide you.

00:46:58.420 --> 00:47:00.460 align:middle line:84%
You have the free
will to ignore it.

00:47:00.460 --> 00:47:03.570 align:middle line:10%
But if you do, you
do so at your peril

00:47:03.570 --> 00:47:06.450 align:middle line:10%
because your physical
mind is not designed

00:47:06.450 --> 00:47:08.290 align:middle line:10%
to control those things.

00:47:08.290 --> 00:47:11.800 align:middle line:84%
It's not designed to
know what will happen.

00:47:11.800 --> 00:47:15.345 align:middle line:84%
It's designed to know
what's happening.

00:47:15.345 --> 00:47:18.550 align:middle line:84%
It's what gives you the ability
to have a physical experience.

00:47:18.550 --> 00:47:19.770 align:middle line:90%
That's its job.

00:47:19.770 --> 00:47:21.840 align:middle line:84%
It should not be
given any other job

00:47:21.840 --> 00:47:23.580 align:middle line:84%
other than to allow
you to experience

00:47:23.580 --> 00:47:25.320 align:middle line:90%
what it is that's happening.

00:47:25.320 --> 00:47:28.420 align:middle line:84%
The higher mind is
the guiding principle.

00:47:28.420 --> 00:47:29.710 align:middle line:90%
This is what's telling you.

00:47:29.710 --> 00:47:30.730 align:middle line:90%
This is your path.

00:47:30.730 --> 00:47:32.290 align:middle line:90%
Remember who you are.

00:47:32.290 --> 00:47:33.730 align:middle line:90%
Things will flow.

00:47:33.730 --> 00:47:38.500 align:middle line:84%
We all have a current in
the ocean of creation.

00:47:38.500 --> 00:47:41.020 align:middle line:84%
If we just flow
with our current,

00:47:41.020 --> 00:47:43.540 align:middle line:84%
our current knows exactly
where we need to go.

00:47:43.540 --> 00:47:45.340 align:middle line:90%
Stop swimming upstream.

00:47:45.340 --> 00:47:46.800 align:middle line:90%
You'll have a much happier life.

00:47:46.800 --> 00:47:47.600 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: OK.

00:47:47.600 --> 00:47:49.620 align:middle line:84%
On that note, thank
you so much, Darryl,

00:47:49.620 --> 00:47:50.995 align:middle line:84%
and I hope to see
you here again.

00:47:50.995 --> 00:47:52.078 align:middle line:90%
>>ANKA: Thank you, Regina.

00:47:52.078 --> 00:47:53.280 align:middle line:90%
This has been a pleasure.

00:47:53.280 --> 00:47:55.320 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: If you'd like
to spend days going down

00:47:55.320 --> 00:47:57.880 align:middle line:84%
such intriguing and
relevant rabbit holes,

00:47:57.880 --> 00:47:59.100 align:middle line:90%
you can go to bashar.org.

00:47:59.100 --> 00:48:02.910 align:middle line:84%
Darryl has dedicated his life to
bringing this knowledge forward

00:48:02.910 --> 00:48:05.350 align:middle line:90%
and deserves our deep gratitude.

00:48:05.350 --> 00:48:09.740 align:middle line:84%
Until next time, thank you for
joining us here on Open Minds.

00:48:09.740 --> 00:48:12.000 align:middle line:90%
