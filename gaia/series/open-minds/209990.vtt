>>MATIAS DE STEFANO: And there
was a picture of the pyramids.

00:00:11.150 --> 00:00:14.030 align:middle line:84%
When I saw it everything,
moved like in a tunnel.

00:00:14.030 --> 00:00:17.150 align:middle line:84%
And I was a woman, and
I was really worried.

00:00:17.150 --> 00:00:19.490 align:middle line:84%
That was the first
memories I got.

00:00:19.490 --> 00:00:22.040 align:middle line:84%
Emotion is basically a
chakra moving constantly,

00:00:22.040 --> 00:00:25.190 align:middle line:84%
so the best way to
transmit an information

00:00:25.190 --> 00:00:28.250 align:middle line:84%
from one time to another
is through the emotion

00:00:28.250 --> 00:00:30.860 align:middle line:84%
because it's like a train
with all the wheels.

00:00:30.860 --> 00:00:35.450 align:middle line:84%
So our mind is creating
an idea of how good it

00:00:35.450 --> 00:00:37.130 align:middle line:90%
is to not feel that.

00:00:37.130 --> 00:00:39.980 align:middle line:84%
But our body is saying,
yeah, but to get there

00:00:39.980 --> 00:00:41.270 align:middle line:90%
you have to go through pain.

00:00:41.270 --> 00:00:46.050 align:middle line:84%
We are evolving so fast that we
cannot be aware of how good we

00:00:46.050 --> 00:00:46.850 align:middle line:90%
are.

00:00:46.850 --> 00:00:49.430 align:middle line:84%
Basically, that's the
politics of democracy

00:00:49.430 --> 00:00:51.830 align:middle line:84%
and that worked for
thousands of years

00:00:51.830 --> 00:00:53.963 align:middle line:90%

much more to offer

you for inviting me.

>>REGINA: Yes, it's
so good to see you.

00:01:39.140 --> 00:01:41.720 align:middle line:84%
So let's just start a little
bit at the beginning right now,

00:01:41.720 --> 00:01:44.180 align:middle line:84%
and that is as a
teenager, and what

00:01:44.180 --> 00:01:48.050 align:middle line:84%
started happening in history
class to you in this lifetime.

00:01:48.050 --> 00:01:50.450 align:middle line:10%
>>DE STEFANO: Well, it's
been all my life for sure

00:01:50.450 --> 00:01:52.640 align:middle line:10%
that I had this connection
with other beings

00:01:52.640 --> 00:01:55.310 align:middle line:10%
from other dimensions
that for me were just

00:01:55.310 --> 00:01:57.140 align:middle line:10%
part of the family.

00:01:57.140 --> 00:02:01.640 align:middle line:84%
I had no idea that they
were from other sides.

00:02:01.640 --> 00:02:07.340 align:middle line:84%
And there was one day when I was
12 years old that they told me,

00:02:07.340 --> 00:02:08.824 align:middle line:90%
you won't see us anymore.

00:02:08.824 --> 00:02:12.860 align:middle line:84%
You won't be able to watch
us to see our shapes anymore,

00:02:12.860 --> 00:02:14.630 align:middle line:90%
but you will start to remember.

00:02:14.630 --> 00:02:18.920 align:middle line:84%
Next Sunday-- next Monday,
you will start to remember.

00:02:18.920 --> 00:02:21.830 align:middle line:84%
So pay attention to
everything we taught to you,

00:02:21.830 --> 00:02:26.810 align:middle line:84%
and just write it down
and make drawings.

00:02:26.810 --> 00:02:30.710 align:middle line:90%
Don't let it in your mind.

00:02:30.710 --> 00:02:32.430 align:middle line:90%
That was the only advice.

00:02:32.430 --> 00:02:36.200 align:middle line:84%
And so I stopped
seeing them, and--

00:02:36.200 --> 00:02:37.492 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: How was that for you?

00:02:37.492 --> 00:02:38.867 align:middle line:84%
>>DE STEFANO: That
was very tough

00:02:38.867 --> 00:02:40.790 align:middle line:84%
because it was like
losing part of the family.

00:02:40.790 --> 00:02:42.890 align:middle line:84%
Like if they just
said, OK, we have

00:02:42.890 --> 00:02:44.940 align:middle line:90%
to move to another country and--

00:02:44.940 --> 00:02:45.740 align:middle line:90%

can call sometime, but--

00:02:49.570 --> 00:02:51.403 align:middle line:84%
>>DE STEFANO: Yeah,
yeah, it felt like that.

00:02:51.403 --> 00:02:56.600 align:middle line:90%
It was like losing my gran--

00:02:56.600 --> 00:02:59.250 align:middle line:84%
like a big brother or
something like this,

00:02:59.250 --> 00:03:02.720 align:middle line:84%
like other family, someone
who was guiding me.

00:03:02.720 --> 00:03:04.590 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Yeah,
so now here we go.

00:03:04.590 --> 00:03:05.660 align:middle line:90%
You're on your own.

00:03:05.660 --> 00:03:06.460 align:middle line:90%
>>DE STEFANO: Yeah.

00:03:06.460 --> 00:03:09.800 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And let's hop to when
you start experiencing things

00:03:09.800 --> 00:03:12.320 align:middle line:84%
through common information that
was coming up in your life,

00:03:12.320 --> 00:03:13.940 align:middle line:84%
and boom, the
memories come back.

00:03:13.940 --> 00:03:18.500 align:middle line:84%
>>DE STEFANO: Yeah, so that
Monday or Tuesday I think.

00:03:18.500 --> 00:03:22.130 align:middle line:84%
We had this history
class, and the teacher

00:03:22.130 --> 00:03:27.660 align:middle line:84%
gave us these copies with
like ancient history.

00:03:27.660 --> 00:03:31.903 align:middle line:84%
So from the very beginning,
very beginning 3,500 years--

00:03:31.903 --> 00:03:33.320 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Oh, when
humanity began.

00:03:33.320 --> 00:03:37.273 align:middle line:84%
>>DE STEFANO: Yeah, well, the
first civilizations and stuff.

00:03:37.273 --> 00:03:38.940 align:middle line:84%
And there was a picture
of the pyramids,

00:03:38.940 --> 00:03:41.750 align:middle line:84%
which until that moment
for me was nothing.

00:03:41.750 --> 00:03:48.920 align:middle line:84%
But when I saw it, I had a
headache, like a pain here,

00:03:48.920 --> 00:03:53.960 align:middle line:84%
and I just saw like everything
move like in a tunnel.

00:03:53.960 --> 00:03:57.230 align:middle line:84%
And I saw the
pyramids, only one.

00:03:57.230 --> 00:04:00.170 align:middle line:84%
Actually it took many years
until I saw the three.

00:04:00.170 --> 00:04:02.957 align:middle line:84%
I was only seeing one,
the one and the middle.

00:04:02.957 --> 00:04:05.540 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Was that because you
were seeing from different time

00:04:05.540 --> 00:04:06.770 align:middle line:90%
frames?

00:04:06.770 --> 00:04:09.110 align:middle line:84%
>>DE STEFANO: I thought it
was different time frame,

00:04:09.110 --> 00:04:13.190 align:middle line:84%
but also I thought
that I was emotionally

00:04:13.190 --> 00:04:15.659 align:middle line:84%
linked to that pyramid
even more than the others.

00:04:15.659 --> 00:04:16.459 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: OK.

00:04:16.459 --> 00:04:19.960 align:middle line:84%
>>DE STEFANO: So my mind just
got rid of the other ones

00:04:19.960 --> 00:04:20.760 align:middle line:90%
and said--

00:04:20.760 --> 00:04:23.930 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Focused on
what was important, yeah.

00:04:23.930 --> 00:04:28.070 align:middle line:84%
>>DE STEFANO: But
I saw it white,

00:04:28.070 --> 00:04:29.820 align:middle line:84%
and everything was
very different.

00:04:29.820 --> 00:04:30.950 align:middle line:90%
There were trees.

00:04:30.950 --> 00:04:32.870 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Well, it was
covered at one time

00:04:32.870 --> 00:04:34.285 align:middle line:90%
in white-- it was white.

00:04:34.285 --> 00:04:35.660 align:middle line:84%
I don't know if
it was limestone,

00:04:35.660 --> 00:04:37.290 align:middle line:90%
but it was covered in white.

00:04:37.290 --> 00:04:38.090 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:04:38.090 --> 00:04:39.692 align:middle line:84%
>>DE STEFANO: And
white and alabaster.

00:04:39.692 --> 00:04:41.150 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Alabaster,
correct, yeah.

00:04:41.150 --> 00:04:43.130 align:middle line:84%
>>DE STEFANO: So
they were shining--

00:04:43.130 --> 00:04:43.430 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:04:43.430 --> 00:04:44.710 align:middle line:84%
>>DE STEFANO: Like
stars on Earth,

00:04:44.710 --> 00:04:45.620 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:04:45.620 --> 00:04:48.920 align:middle line:84%
>>DE STEFANO: And I saw that
image, and the second image

00:04:48.920 --> 00:04:50.990 align:middle line:84%
I had was in front
of the Sphinx,

00:04:50.990 --> 00:04:53.180 align:middle line:90%
which was like a red lion.

00:04:53.180 --> 00:04:57.230 align:middle line:84%
And I was a woman
aside of my husband,

00:04:57.230 --> 00:04:59.330 align:middle line:90%
and I was really worried.

00:04:59.330 --> 00:05:02.540 align:middle line:84%
And that was the first
memories I got that day.

00:05:02.540 --> 00:05:06.170 align:middle line:84%
And from that moment on, every
day, I had another memory.

00:05:06.170 --> 00:05:08.510 align:middle line:84%
Sometimes it was
part of the language.

00:05:08.510 --> 00:05:11.090 align:middle line:84%
Sometimes something that
happened in my family.

00:05:11.090 --> 00:05:15.000 align:middle line:84%
Sometimes something that
happened in the village.

00:05:15.000 --> 00:05:16.580 align:middle line:90%
So it was all mixed.

00:05:16.580 --> 00:05:20.120 align:middle line:84%
I couldn't really put the
whole picture together

00:05:20.120 --> 00:05:23.937 align:middle line:90%
until I was like 17, 18.

00:05:23.937 --> 00:05:25.520 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And what
did you figure out?

00:05:25.520 --> 00:05:27.230 align:middle line:90%
What was that story about?

00:05:27.230 --> 00:05:28.940 align:middle line:84%
Why was it important
you were seeing it?

00:05:28.940 --> 00:05:32.150 align:middle line:84%
>>DE STEFANO: I realized that
I was remembering that story

00:05:32.150 --> 00:05:35.210 align:middle line:84%
because I was in the
mirror time of that story,

00:05:35.210 --> 00:05:40.610 align:middle line:84%
like I am right at the other
side of the timeline of that.

00:05:40.610 --> 00:05:42.740 align:middle line:90%
So I'm mirroring that moment.

00:05:42.740 --> 00:05:46.260 align:middle line:84%
That's why for me was more
important than all the rest.

00:05:46.260 --> 00:05:50.580 align:middle line:84%
And also because I
decided something

00:05:50.580 --> 00:05:56.140 align:middle line:84%
in that moment in that life
that I said in that time,

00:05:56.140 --> 00:06:00.050 align:middle line:84%
I had to finish it in my
mirrored time, which is now.

00:06:00.050 --> 00:06:01.300 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: OK, so what did it--

00:06:01.300 --> 00:06:02.770 align:middle line:90%
A, we'll get into mirrored time.

00:06:02.770 --> 00:06:05.570 align:middle line:90%
What is it you had to finish?

00:06:05.570 --> 00:06:10.430 align:middle line:84%
>>DE STEFANO: I had to do a
reconnection of the network

00:06:10.430 --> 00:06:12.740 align:middle line:90%
of consciousness.

00:06:12.740 --> 00:06:16.190 align:middle line:84%
For that time, it was different
because it was Leo time,

00:06:16.190 --> 00:06:21.660 align:middle line:84%
so it was all about the
governments and the families,

00:06:21.660 --> 00:06:25.340 align:middle line:84%
the structure of the main
families ruling the planet

00:06:25.340 --> 00:06:29.840 align:middle line:84%
and trying to settle the power
in the main sources, which

00:06:29.840 --> 00:06:32.840 align:middle line:84%
were like the pyramids or other
pyramids around the world.

00:06:32.840 --> 00:06:35.150 align:middle line:84%
And for the new
time, it would be

00:06:35.150 --> 00:06:40.130 align:middle line:84%
networks, how every individual
should be its own government

00:06:40.130 --> 00:06:43.850 align:middle line:84%
and creating a new network
besides the pyramids,

00:06:43.850 --> 00:06:46.230 align:middle line:84%
like creating it
in a different way.

00:06:46.230 --> 00:06:48.140 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Which is the
timeline we're in now.

required of us now.

00:06:49.550 --> 00:06:54.305 align:middle line:84%
Did you get a sense of the
dynastic period at all?

>>DE STEFANO: Dynastic, no.

00:06:55.430 --> 00:06:58.625 align:middle line:84%
Well, it was a dynasty,
but it was not Egyptian.

00:06:58.625 --> 00:06:59.425 align:middle line:90%
OK,

00:06:59.425 --> 00:06:59.690 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: OK, it wasn't--

00:06:59.690 --> 00:07:01.280 align:middle line:84%
>>DE STEFANO: It was
Egypt, but it was not--

00:07:01.280 --> 00:07:01.580 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: It was not.

00:07:01.580 --> 00:07:02.360 align:middle line:90%
So it might have been even--

00:07:02.360 --> 00:07:03.652 align:middle line:90%
>>DE STEFANO: Egyptian culture.

00:07:03.652 --> 00:07:06.472 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: OK, so if some
of the people and some

00:07:06.472 --> 00:07:08.180 align:middle line:84%
of the traditions that
talk about the age

00:07:08.180 --> 00:07:12.710 align:middle line:84%
of the Great Pyramid put it at
85,000 to 200,000 years old,

00:07:12.710 --> 00:07:14.900 align:middle line:84%
you could have been
looking at history prior

00:07:14.900 --> 00:07:16.192 align:middle line:90%
to any of the dynastic periods.

00:07:16.192 --> 00:07:17.400 align:middle line:90%
>>DE STEFANO: Yes, of course.

00:07:17.400 --> 00:07:18.320 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:07:18.320 --> 00:07:20.930 align:middle line:84%
>>DE STEFANO: The
people in Egypt

00:07:20.930 --> 00:07:23.360 align:middle line:84%
that were from the
dynastic period, they

00:07:23.360 --> 00:07:25.070 align:middle line:90%
rebuilt the pyramids.

00:07:25.070 --> 00:07:26.100 align:middle line:90%
They did some works.

00:07:26.100 --> 00:07:26.900 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:07:26.900 --> 00:07:28.260 align:middle line:90%
>>DE STEFANO: Repairing them.

00:07:28.260 --> 00:07:29.120 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: They weren't
the originators.

00:07:29.120 --> 00:07:30.650 align:middle line:84%
>>DE STEFANO: But they
weren't the original ones

00:07:30.650 --> 00:07:31.550 align:middle line:90%
creating them.

00:07:31.550 --> 00:07:34.700 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: OK, now let's talk
about the opposite timeline

00:07:34.700 --> 00:07:36.140 align:middle line:90%
and what you mean by that.

00:07:36.140 --> 00:07:39.830 align:middle line:84%
I mean, there are
some theories that

00:07:39.830 --> 00:07:42.770 align:middle line:84%
may very well be
true that everything

00:07:42.770 --> 00:07:44.550 align:middle line:90%
has its mirrored opposite.

00:07:44.550 --> 00:07:48.620 align:middle line:84%
So whatever we are in now has
us in our mirrored opposite

00:07:48.620 --> 00:07:50.060 align:middle line:90%
in that timeline.

00:07:50.060 --> 00:07:52.140 align:middle line:84%
Explain it how you
see it, understand it,

00:07:52.140 --> 00:07:54.890 align:middle line:84%
and why-- how did
you know that was it?

00:07:54.890 --> 00:07:56.570 align:middle line:84%
Because of what
you know and came

00:07:56.570 --> 00:08:00.110 align:middle line:84%
to do that you figured that
out, or is there something maybe

00:08:00.110 --> 00:08:03.170 align:middle line:90%
more linear as an explanation?

00:08:03.170 --> 00:08:07.320 align:middle line:84%
>>DE STEFANO: Well, I understood
that when I was 16 or 17,

00:08:07.320 --> 00:08:11.810 align:middle line:84%
I guess, about how we
can interpret things,

00:08:11.810 --> 00:08:15.788 align:middle line:84%
like for example, from the
third dimension point of view

00:08:15.788 --> 00:08:17.330 align:middle line:84%
or the fourth
dimension point of view

00:08:17.330 --> 00:08:20.210 align:middle line:84%
is dependent on which dimension
you want to explain something.

00:08:20.210 --> 00:08:21.010 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:08:21.010 --> 00:08:23.240 align:middle line:84%
>>DE STEFANO: It changes,
so it's not linear.

00:08:23.240 --> 00:08:25.160 align:middle line:84%
The explanation
is not like, this

00:08:25.160 --> 00:08:27.830 align:middle line:84%
happens because of
this and this and this.

00:08:27.830 --> 00:08:30.830 align:middle line:84%
It's according to which
dimension you explain it.

00:08:30.830 --> 00:08:34.590 align:middle line:84%
So from our point of
view, that is the past,

00:08:34.590 --> 00:08:36.830 align:middle line:84%
so it's something
that already happened.

00:08:36.830 --> 00:08:40.250 align:middle line:84%
And that condition,
our civilization today,

00:08:40.250 --> 00:08:41.172 align:middle line:90%
through time.

00:08:41.172 --> 00:08:43.130 align:middle line:84%
From the point of view
of the fourth dimension,

00:08:43.130 --> 00:08:44.810 align:middle line:90%
that is still happening.

00:08:44.810 --> 00:08:47.240 align:middle line:84%
And because that's
still happening,

00:08:47.240 --> 00:08:50.510 align:middle line:84%
it's conditioning us
today as our actions today

00:08:50.510 --> 00:08:53.750 align:middle line:84%
is conditioning what
is happening there,

00:08:53.750 --> 00:08:56.600 align:middle line:84%
so it depends on
the point of view.

00:08:56.600 --> 00:08:59.240 align:middle line:84%
But the thing is that
all in the universe

00:08:59.240 --> 00:09:02.330 align:middle line:84%
has a positive and a
negative, and everything

00:09:02.330 --> 00:09:05.540 align:middle line:84%
flows in a cycle, ups
and downs, in and out.

00:09:05.540 --> 00:09:10.400 align:middle line:84%
So everything moves in
this kind of cycles.

00:09:10.400 --> 00:09:15.140 align:middle line:84%
So when we talk about time,
a way of understanding this

00:09:15.140 --> 00:09:18.290 align:middle line:90%
is like talking about vibration.

00:09:18.290 --> 00:09:22.380 align:middle line:84%
Vibration is like the space
point of view of the universe,

00:09:22.380 --> 00:09:24.320 align:middle line:90%
so everything is vibrating.

00:09:24.320 --> 00:09:30.710 align:middle line:84%
And the frequency is the time
point of view of the space.

00:09:30.710 --> 00:09:36.680 align:middle line:84%
So frequency is basically
how many times that vibration

00:09:36.680 --> 00:09:38.760 align:middle line:90%
moves through space.

00:09:38.760 --> 00:09:40.943 align:middle line:84%
And so you can calculate
the time through--

00:09:40.943 --> 00:09:42.860 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: This can be
very short or very long.

00:09:42.860 --> 00:09:43.700 align:middle line:90%
>>DE STEFANO: Exactly.

00:09:43.700 --> 00:09:44.195 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Explanation--

00:09:44.195 --> 00:09:45.380 align:middle line:90%
[INTERPOSING VOICES]

00:09:45.380 --> 00:09:45.650 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

00:09:45.650 --> 00:09:46.430 align:middle line:90%
>>DE STEFANO: Or fast.

00:09:46.430 --> 00:09:47.230 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:09:47.230 --> 00:09:48.920 align:middle line:84%
>>DE STEFANO: So
that's the frequency.

00:09:48.920 --> 00:09:50.547 align:middle line:90%
Frequency is how many--

00:09:50.547 --> 00:09:51.380 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Intervals.

00:09:51.380 --> 00:09:53.040 align:middle line:84%
>>DE STEFANO:
Intervals you have.

00:09:53.040 --> 00:09:58.190 align:middle line:84%
So when we relate that to
the movement of the planet--

00:09:58.190 --> 00:10:01.820 align:middle line:84%
for example, the planet
moves like 72 degrees.

00:10:01.820 --> 00:10:07.445 align:middle line:84%
Its axis, it moves in a circle,
spinning 72 degrees every--

00:10:07.445 --> 00:10:11.150 align:middle line:90%


00:10:11.150 --> 00:10:13.468 align:middle line:84%
it moves every 200 years
or something like that.

00:10:13.468 --> 00:10:14.510 align:middle line:90%
I don't remember exactly.

00:10:14.510 --> 00:10:23.360 align:middle line:84%
But it is spinning constantly,
so it moves its axis

00:10:23.360 --> 00:10:29.130 align:middle line:84%
pointing in a new star, Northern
Star, every 2,500 years.

00:10:29.130 --> 00:10:33.420 align:middle line:84%
So that means that when
it makes the whole turn,

00:10:33.420 --> 00:10:37.670 align:middle line:84%
it's in the same point,
so kind of the same things

00:10:37.670 --> 00:10:38.790 align:middle line:90%
would happen.

00:10:38.790 --> 00:10:41.330 align:middle line:84%
So the opposite
side is the one that

00:10:41.330 --> 00:10:46.190 align:middle line:84%
reflects what is happening,
so it's like a clock.

00:10:46.190 --> 00:10:48.470 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So could you
say in your personal life,

00:10:48.470 --> 00:10:51.890 align:middle line:84%
you had started something that
wasn't completed at that time,

00:10:51.890 --> 00:10:54.140 align:middle line:84%
and it took until
this time around

00:10:54.140 --> 00:10:58.280 align:middle line:84%
in that kind of frequency
band before you were ready.

00:10:58.280 --> 00:11:01.190 align:middle line:84%
So that would be called
your mirrored timeline

00:11:01.190 --> 00:11:03.800 align:middle line:84%
before you were ready to
resonate back with that

00:11:03.800 --> 00:11:05.258 align:middle line:84%
and pick it up and
take it further.

00:11:05.258 --> 00:11:06.508 align:middle line:90%
>>DE STEFANO: Yes, it's like--

00:11:06.508 --> 00:11:08.570 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So it doesn't
have a determinate number

00:11:08.570 --> 00:11:09.440 align:middle line:90%
of years in it.

00:11:09.440 --> 00:11:11.340 align:middle line:84%
It's determined
on the situation.

00:11:11.340 --> 00:11:12.140 align:middle line:90%
>>DE STEFANO: Yes.

00:11:12.140 --> 00:11:13.057 align:middle line:90%
It's on the situation.

00:11:13.057 --> 00:11:16.770 align:middle line:84%
It's like if you have a circle,
like a clock, with many chords.

00:11:16.770 --> 00:11:17.570 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:11:17.570 --> 00:11:21.830 align:middle line:84%
>>DE STEFANO: OK so those chords
are resounding constantly,

00:11:21.830 --> 00:11:25.940 align:middle line:84%
but the only way the
chord can sound perfectly

00:11:25.940 --> 00:11:30.050 align:middle line:84%
is if one side and the other
side, the opposite side

00:11:30.050 --> 00:11:31.340 align:middle line:90%
are very well tied.

00:11:31.340 --> 00:11:32.140 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:11:32.140 --> 00:11:34.640 align:middle line:84%
>>DE STEFANO: So if there is
a tension between the lines.

00:11:34.640 --> 00:11:36.980 align:middle line:84%
That means that
whatever happens here

00:11:36.980 --> 00:11:39.660 align:middle line:84%
in the opposite will create
a possibility in this one.

00:11:39.660 --> 00:11:40.460 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:11:40.460 --> 00:11:46.280 align:middle line:84%
>>DE STEFANO: So it will resound
if we are very well known--

00:11:46.280 --> 00:11:50.190 align:middle line:84%
if we have awareness of
what happens the other side.

00:11:50.190 --> 00:11:52.010 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So as
an example, you're

00:11:52.010 --> 00:11:54.500 align:middle line:84%
talking about something
that could have happened 20,

00:11:54.500 --> 00:11:57.260 align:middle line:84%
30, 40, 50,000
years ago, wherever

00:11:57.260 --> 00:12:01.890 align:middle line:84%
it was pegged in predynastic
Egypt into this day and time.

00:12:01.890 --> 00:12:03.950 align:middle line:84%
But on the other
hand, maybe it was

00:12:03.950 --> 00:12:07.070 align:middle line:84%
something that happened 80 years
ago in another lifetime that

00:12:07.070 --> 00:12:09.800 align:middle line:84%
was started and the resonance
was created and is now

00:12:09.800 --> 00:12:10.850 align:middle line:90%
going to be picked up.

00:12:10.850 --> 00:12:13.370 align:middle line:84%
Would that be considered
still it's opposite timeline?

00:12:13.370 --> 00:12:14.284 align:middle line:90%
>>DE STEFANO: Yes.

00:12:14.284 --> 00:12:15.200 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: OK.

00:12:15.200 --> 00:12:16.610 align:middle line:84%
>>DE STEFANO: Yes,
yes, it's always--

00:12:16.610 --> 00:12:18.350 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: It's the
resonance that's created.

00:12:18.350 --> 00:12:19.640 align:middle line:84%
>>DE STEFANO: It's not
the specific moment--

00:12:19.640 --> 00:12:20.900 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:12:20.900 --> 00:12:22.968 align:middle line:84%
>>DE STEFANO: Every
moment has its own--

00:12:22.968 --> 00:12:24.260 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Well, that's helpful.

00:12:24.260 --> 00:12:26.750 align:middle line:90%
>>DE STEFANO: Its own line.

00:12:26.750 --> 00:12:29.330 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So you spin something
into motion in one lifetime,

00:12:29.330 --> 00:12:31.250 align:middle line:84%
whenever that was,
and there comes

00:12:31.250 --> 00:12:33.350 align:middle line:84%
a time when you come
back into resonance

00:12:33.350 --> 00:12:35.330 align:middle line:90%
to complete or carry forward.

00:12:35.330 --> 00:12:37.220 align:middle line:84%
>>DE STEFANO: Yeah,
because the resonance

00:12:37.220 --> 00:12:41.150 align:middle line:84%
that I set in that moment are
flowing through the resonance

00:12:41.150 --> 00:12:42.080 align:middle line:90%
to these moments.

00:12:42.080 --> 00:12:42.880 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:12:42.880 --> 00:12:45.330 align:middle line:84%
>>DE STEFANO: So I'm receiving
directly that information.

00:12:45.330 --> 00:12:47.360 align:middle line:84%
And the reason why
I am receiving it

00:12:47.360 --> 00:12:50.370 align:middle line:84%
is because I did
everything in that moment

00:12:50.370 --> 00:12:53.630 align:middle line:84%
so I could listen to
myself in this moment.

00:12:53.630 --> 00:12:58.040 align:middle line:84%
So most of the people
don't do exactly that way.

00:12:58.040 --> 00:13:01.510 align:middle line:84%
It's just most of
the people just

00:13:01.510 --> 00:13:05.740 align:middle line:84%
let it go through the
biological way, which takes--

00:13:05.740 --> 00:13:06.670 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: A long time.

00:13:06.670 --> 00:13:11.080 align:middle line:84%
>>DE STEFANO: Long time
and many misconceptions

00:13:11.080 --> 00:13:12.770 align:middle line:90%
of what is happening.

00:13:12.770 --> 00:13:16.870 align:middle line:84%
So some people, they just
throw a line straight instead

00:13:16.870 --> 00:13:18.140 align:middle line:90%
of doing the whole turn.

00:13:18.140 --> 00:13:18.940 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:13:18.940 --> 00:13:20.565 align:middle line:84%
>>DE STEFANO: So
that's why some people

00:13:20.565 --> 00:13:24.343 align:middle line:84%
can remember exactly what
happened in the opposite time.

00:13:24.343 --> 00:13:25.260 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Interesting.

00:13:25.260 --> 00:13:26.920 align:middle line:90%
OK, thank you for sharing that.

00:13:26.920 --> 00:13:30.370 align:middle line:84%
Another thing you talk about
is the notion of emotions

00:13:30.370 --> 00:13:35.050 align:middle line:84%
and how emotion plays into our
being able to resonate back

00:13:35.050 --> 00:13:38.540 align:middle line:84%
into a period or
forward into a period,

00:13:38.540 --> 00:13:39.800 align:middle line:90%
and we can talk about that.

00:13:39.800 --> 00:13:44.460 align:middle line:84%
What is the role of emotion
in past life recall?

00:13:44.460 --> 00:13:49.470 align:middle line:84%
>>DE STEFANO: Well, emotion
basically means a motion.

00:13:49.470 --> 00:13:51.990 align:middle line:90%
It's movement, that's the word.

00:13:51.990 --> 00:13:55.170 align:middle line:84%
So everything that is in
movement has an emotion.

00:13:55.170 --> 00:13:57.090 align:middle line:90%
That's basically what it is.

00:13:57.090 --> 00:14:01.650 align:middle line:84%
So we move through emotions,
which are basically

00:14:01.650 --> 00:14:06.870 align:middle line:84%
the hormones, the reactions
of our glands making

00:14:06.870 --> 00:14:11.860 align:middle line:84%
hormones that activate the body,
the neurons to do an action.

00:14:11.860 --> 00:14:15.310 align:middle line:84%
So what we call an emotion is
not something outside our body,

00:14:15.310 --> 00:14:17.670 align:middle line:84%
but it's something
produced in our body

00:14:17.670 --> 00:14:20.080 align:middle line:90%
through motion of energy.

00:14:20.080 --> 00:14:22.500 align:middle line:84%
So in order for something
to be able to move,

00:14:22.500 --> 00:14:25.440 align:middle line:84%
it needs a positive
and a negative energy

00:14:25.440 --> 00:14:26.850 align:middle line:90%
that creates polarity.

00:14:26.850 --> 00:14:29.700 align:middle line:84%
Polarity creates movement
because of magnetism,

00:14:29.700 --> 00:14:32.170 align:middle line:84%
so it spins, so
that's the movement,

00:14:32.170 --> 00:14:35.520 align:middle line:84%
and that's what creates this
movement constantly like this.

00:14:35.520 --> 00:14:38.310 align:middle line:84%
That we used to
call in Sanskrit,

00:14:38.310 --> 00:14:39.570 align:middle line:90%
like in India, chakra.

00:14:39.570 --> 00:14:42.570 align:middle line:84%
Chakra means wheel, basically
something that is moving.

00:14:42.570 --> 00:14:46.800 align:middle line:84%
So emotion is basically a
chakra moving constantly,

00:14:46.800 --> 00:14:50.110 align:middle line:90%
which allows us to move forward.

00:14:50.110 --> 00:14:56.220 align:middle line:84%
So what this means that the
information in the universe

00:14:56.220 --> 00:14:58.560 align:middle line:90%
is storage through movement.

00:14:58.560 --> 00:15:00.540 align:middle line:90%
It constantly evolving.

00:15:00.540 --> 00:15:03.000 align:middle line:84%
Evolving basically
means to roll down,

00:15:03.000 --> 00:15:06.640 align:middle line:84%
so it's something that
is constantly moving.

00:15:06.640 --> 00:15:09.870 align:middle line:84%
So the best way to
transmit an information

00:15:09.870 --> 00:15:12.930 align:middle line:84%
from one time to another
is through the emotion,

00:15:12.930 --> 00:15:15.250 align:middle line:84%
because it's like a train
with all the wheels moving.

00:15:15.250 --> 00:15:17.550 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: It doesn't also
have almost like a magnetic,

00:15:17.550 --> 00:15:21.960 align:middle line:84%
more magnetic quality to it
that kind of draws you almost

00:15:21.960 --> 00:15:25.050 align:middle line:84%
in a sticky way into
the visceral reality

00:15:25.050 --> 00:15:27.963 align:middle line:84%
of the emotion, which also
means trauma, which is--

00:15:27.963 --> 00:15:29.880 align:middle line:84%
>>DE STEFANO: Yeah, all
the levels of emotion.

00:15:29.880 --> 00:15:33.010 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: All of it throughout
our history of incarnations.

00:15:33.010 --> 00:15:33.810 align:middle line:90%
>>DE STEFANO: Yeah.

00:15:33.810 --> 00:15:35.280 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:15:35.280 --> 00:15:39.930 align:middle line:84%
>>DE STEFANO: All the emotions,
the most horrible ones,

00:15:39.930 --> 00:15:42.420 align:middle line:84%
the darkest one til
the most light ones,

00:15:42.420 --> 00:15:44.200 align:middle line:90%
they are all like a library.

00:15:44.200 --> 00:15:45.000 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:15:45.000 --> 00:15:46.770 align:middle line:84%
>>DE STEFANO: They are
storages of information.

00:15:46.770 --> 00:15:47.820 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And part
of the subconscious

00:15:47.820 --> 00:15:49.050 align:middle line:90%
that carries forward.

00:15:49.050 --> 00:15:50.520 align:middle line:90%
>>DE STEFANO: Yeah.

00:15:50.520 --> 00:15:53.940 align:middle line:84%
So we have all the
emotions that our ancestors

00:15:53.940 --> 00:15:56.790 align:middle line:84%
and our previous lives
have been feeling,

00:15:56.790 --> 00:16:00.010 align:middle line:84%
so they shaped us
where we are now.

00:16:00.010 --> 00:16:02.280 align:middle line:84%
So through emotions,
we can awaken what

00:16:02.280 --> 00:16:04.210 align:middle line:90%
was happening in that time.

00:16:04.210 --> 00:16:07.350 align:middle line:84%
That's why when we tried
to remember a past life,

00:16:07.350 --> 00:16:10.050 align:middle line:84%
usually it comes
with an emotion,

00:16:10.050 --> 00:16:14.350 align:middle line:84%
and it's through the emotion
that we can remember it better.

00:16:14.350 --> 00:16:15.150 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:16:15.150 --> 00:16:19.370 align:middle line:84%
In fact, looking at it
through the lens of emotion,

00:16:19.370 --> 00:16:22.250 align:middle line:84%
it seems that a lot of time
when people go into past lives,

00:16:22.250 --> 00:16:24.410 align:middle line:84%
it is trauma that kind
of draws them back.

00:16:24.410 --> 00:16:25.910 align:middle line:84%
Because clearly
when there's trauma,

00:16:25.910 --> 00:16:27.530 align:middle line:84%
there's something
that's been blunted

00:16:27.530 --> 00:16:30.460 align:middle line:84%
and has not been allowed to be
properly handled or finished

00:16:30.460 --> 00:16:31.260 align:middle line:90%
or whatnot.

00:16:31.260 --> 00:16:34.580 align:middle line:84%
So it makes sense you want
to transform that ultimately.

00:16:34.580 --> 00:16:36.950 align:middle line:84%
But what's interesting
to me is it

00:16:36.950 --> 00:16:40.310 align:middle line:84%
seems that when you have the
density of those emotions

00:16:40.310 --> 00:16:44.680 align:middle line:84%
in trauma, you can kind of go
back into it fairly easily.

00:16:44.680 --> 00:16:48.940 align:middle line:84%
When it's an event that is
very fine and ephemeral,

00:16:48.940 --> 00:16:51.340 align:middle line:84%
it doesn't have the
same stickiness and draw

00:16:51.340 --> 00:16:53.360 align:middle line:90%
and the same pulling power.

00:16:53.360 --> 00:16:54.160 align:middle line:90%
>>DE STEFANO: Yeah.

00:16:54.160 --> 00:16:55.702 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: It almost
doesn't seem fair

00:16:55.702 --> 00:16:59.110 align:middle line:84%
that we can easily recall all
of this stuff that's painful

00:16:59.110 --> 00:17:01.960 align:middle line:84%
and all the beautiful,
beautiful ephemeral stuff seems

00:17:01.960 --> 00:17:03.280 align:middle line:90%
to have just floated away.

00:17:03.280 --> 00:17:04.810 align:middle line:90%
>>DE STEFANO: Yeah.

00:17:04.810 --> 00:17:11.589 align:middle line:84%
Yes, well basically it's because
our mind is designed to expand,

00:17:11.589 --> 00:17:15.050 align:middle line:84%
but our body is
designed to survive.

00:17:15.050 --> 00:17:18.920 align:middle line:84%
What this means is that
the body is basically

00:17:18.920 --> 00:17:22.069 align:middle line:84%
a conjunction of cells
that has been evolving,

00:17:22.069 --> 00:17:26.670 align:middle line:84%
trying to survive in a
very hostile environment.

00:17:26.670 --> 00:17:29.910 align:middle line:84%
So the cells are trying to
pay attention to the pain--

00:17:29.910 --> 00:17:30.710 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:17:30.710 --> 00:17:32.945 align:middle line:84%
>>DE STEFANO: Not
the pleasure mainly.

00:17:32.945 --> 00:17:34.320 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: That
makes total sense.

00:17:34.320 --> 00:17:35.120 align:middle line:90%
Absolutely.

00:17:35.120 --> 00:17:36.800 align:middle line:84%
>>DE STEFANO: Because
if I feel pain,

00:17:36.800 --> 00:17:39.470 align:middle line:84%
that means that I will
understand where is

00:17:39.470 --> 00:17:40.940 align:middle line:90%
the problem so I can solve it.

00:17:40.940 --> 00:17:41.990 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:17:41.990 --> 00:17:43.200 align:middle line:90%
>>DE STEFANO: Our mind--

00:17:43.200 --> 00:17:45.380 align:middle line:84%
our brain, sorry,
our brain has been

00:17:45.380 --> 00:17:50.450 align:middle line:84%
designed to interpret the
pain so it can live longer.

00:17:50.450 --> 00:17:54.080 align:middle line:84%
So all our body is
assigned to pay attention

00:17:54.080 --> 00:17:57.658 align:middle line:84%
to the conflicts and the
pain, the suffering--

00:17:57.658 --> 00:17:59.450 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: For the
survival of the physical.

00:17:59.450 --> 00:18:00.710 align:middle line:84%
>>DE STEFANO: For the
survival of the physical.

00:18:00.710 --> 00:18:01.510 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:18:01.510 --> 00:18:06.200 align:middle line:84%
So our mind is creating
an idea of how good it

00:18:06.200 --> 00:18:08.480 align:middle line:90%
is to not feel that.

00:18:08.480 --> 00:18:11.330 align:middle line:84%
But our body is saying,
yeah, but to get there,

00:18:11.330 --> 00:18:15.390 align:middle line:84%
you have to go through pain,
so pay attention to pain.

00:18:15.390 --> 00:18:18.260 align:middle line:84%
That's why when we
remember a past life,

00:18:18.260 --> 00:18:20.450 align:middle line:84%
usually our brain
is saying, OK, let's

00:18:20.450 --> 00:18:22.580 align:middle line:84%
go to the trauma
to try to solve it,

00:18:22.580 --> 00:18:25.130 align:middle line:84%
because the mind is
like constantly looking

00:18:25.130 --> 00:18:28.850 align:middle line:84%
for a conflict in order to
try to solve the conflict

00:18:28.850 --> 00:18:33.995 align:middle line:84%
and make it pleasure
or make it more stable.

00:18:33.995 --> 00:18:36.680 align:middle line:90%


00:18:36.680 --> 00:18:40.010 align:middle line:84%
But in order to do that,
it has to go and look

00:18:40.010 --> 00:18:42.090 align:middle line:90%
for every painful thing.

00:18:42.090 --> 00:18:42.890 align:middle line:90%
So--

00:18:42.890 --> 00:18:45.263 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: It's on high alert,
looking for its threats.

00:18:45.263 --> 00:18:46.430 align:middle line:90%
>>DE STEFANO: Exactly, yeah.

00:18:46.430 --> 00:18:53.010 align:middle line:84%
So while we live an animal
life, because we are still

00:18:53.010 --> 00:18:57.810 align:middle line:84%
living through that
animal state of survival

00:18:57.810 --> 00:19:00.570 align:middle line:84%
because we need
stuff to survive,

00:19:00.570 --> 00:19:03.960 align:middle line:84%
to eat, to live, to feel
secure, to have a partner,

00:19:03.960 --> 00:19:07.900 align:middle line:84%
all these kind of things
are animal point of view.

00:19:07.900 --> 00:19:11.790 align:middle line:84%
So all of these things
takes us to pain

00:19:11.790 --> 00:19:14.520 align:middle line:84%
because we are trying to
solve something to survive.

00:19:14.520 --> 00:19:17.190 align:middle line:84%
When you transcend
the survival, which

00:19:17.190 --> 00:19:19.830 align:middle line:84%
is you don't need
anything else, you're

00:19:19.830 --> 00:19:22.680 align:middle line:84%
just in another state of
level of consciousness

00:19:22.680 --> 00:19:23.930 align:middle line:90%
that you don't need anything--

00:19:23.930 --> 00:19:24.730 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:19:24.730 --> 00:19:26.340 align:middle line:84%
>>DE STEFANO: So
pain disappears.

00:19:26.340 --> 00:19:26.820 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:19:26.820 --> 00:19:28.403 align:middle line:84%
>>DE STEFANO: Because
the cell doesn't

00:19:28.403 --> 00:19:29.860 align:middle line:90%
need to survive anymore.

00:19:29.860 --> 00:19:30.660 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:19:30.660 --> 00:19:32.970 align:middle line:84%
>>DE STEFANO: So that's why
the enlightened ones, they

00:19:32.970 --> 00:19:33.970 align:middle line:90%
don't really suffer.

00:19:33.970 --> 00:19:34.770 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:19:34.770 --> 00:19:36.687 align:middle line:84%
>>DE STEFANO: But in
order to get enlightened,

00:19:36.687 --> 00:19:39.240 align:middle line:84%
they had to suffer
much than any other.

00:19:39.240 --> 00:19:40.140 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:19:40.140 --> 00:19:41.610 align:middle line:84%
>>DE STEFANO: Because
they needed to transcend.

00:19:41.610 --> 00:19:43.443 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: They had to
confront it, and yes--

00:19:43.443 --> 00:19:44.985 align:middle line:84%
>>DE STEFANO: Every
one of the cells.

00:19:44.985 --> 00:19:45.990 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes, yes.

00:19:45.990 --> 00:19:48.840 align:middle line:84%
>>DE STEFANO: That's why when
you see in the past times,

00:19:48.840 --> 00:19:52.260 align:middle line:84%
when you see all the masters,
they have suffered so much.

00:19:52.260 --> 00:19:55.780 align:middle line:84%
They had to suffer a lot
in certain periods of time

00:19:55.780 --> 00:19:59.430 align:middle line:84%
so they could transcend
the pain of every cell

00:19:59.430 --> 00:20:03.150 align:middle line:84%
and to teach the cells,
each one of them,

00:20:03.150 --> 00:20:05.683 align:middle line:84%
that there is no
reason why you survive.

00:20:05.683 --> 00:20:06.600 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: You're safe.

00:20:06.600 --> 00:20:09.810 align:middle line:84%
>>DE STEFANO: Yeah,
because we don't exist.

00:20:09.810 --> 00:20:10.930 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:20:10.930 --> 00:20:12.570 align:middle line:90%
Right, exactly.

00:20:12.570 --> 00:20:15.810 align:middle line:84%
OK, now let's take it out to
a mass consciousness scale.

00:20:15.810 --> 00:20:17.700 align:middle line:84%
And we could talk
for many, many hours

00:20:17.700 --> 00:20:19.150 align:middle line:90%
about the nature of mind--

00:20:19.150 --> 00:20:21.300 align:middle line:84%
higher mind, lower mind,
multidimensional mind.

00:20:21.300 --> 00:20:23.940 align:middle line:84%
And it could get so
esoteric and out there,

00:20:23.940 --> 00:20:25.880 align:middle line:84%
people would start
falling asleep probably.

00:20:25.880 --> 00:20:27.360 align:middle line:90%
>>DE STEFANO: Oh, yeah.

00:20:27.360 --> 00:20:31.470 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So let's focus
on collective trauma,

00:20:31.470 --> 00:20:33.480 align:middle line:90%
such as the inundations.

00:20:33.480 --> 00:20:37.410 align:middle line:84%
And I will say
personally, I went

00:20:37.410 --> 00:20:39.240 align:middle line:84%
through a regression
with Dolores Cannon

00:20:39.240 --> 00:20:40.153 align:middle line:90%
where I ended up--

00:20:40.153 --> 00:20:41.820 align:middle line:84%
I didn't know that's
where I was going--

00:20:41.820 --> 00:20:44.310 align:middle line:84%
I ended up in the
final day of one

00:20:44.310 --> 00:20:46.890 align:middle line:90%
of the Atlantis destructions.

00:20:46.890 --> 00:20:50.850 align:middle line:84%
And the mass trauma that
was created at that time

00:20:50.850 --> 00:20:53.820 align:middle line:84%
created a really
directive that we

00:20:53.820 --> 00:20:56.700 align:middle line:84%
needed to go into
a state of amnesia

00:20:56.700 --> 00:20:58.740 align:middle line:84%
in subsequent incarnations
because too much had

00:20:58.740 --> 00:21:00.865 align:middle line:84%
been lost that we'd have
no incentive to incarnate.

00:21:00.865 --> 00:21:01.665 align:middle line:90%
>>DE STEFANO: Yeah.

00:21:01.665 --> 00:21:04.198 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Blasted ourselves
to the Stone Age, so to speak,

00:21:04.198 --> 00:21:05.490 align:middle line:90%
and that's a whole other story.

00:21:05.490 --> 00:21:08.040 align:middle line:84%
So here we-- so
many people are here

00:21:08.040 --> 00:21:13.350 align:middle line:84%
now that have these incredibly
deep wounds collectively

00:21:13.350 --> 00:21:17.610 align:middle line:84%
from dying en masse--
whether it's an inundation,

00:21:17.610 --> 00:21:20.770 align:middle line:84%
whether it's explosion, land
masses, sinking, and so forth.

00:21:20.770 --> 00:21:27.070 align:middle line:84%
Let's talk about collectively
understood, agreed upon trauma.

00:21:27.070 --> 00:21:31.120 align:middle line:84%
>>DE STEFANO: Well, I will
try to take the human emotion

00:21:31.120 --> 00:21:34.700 align:middle line:84%
of this and trying to put
it outside of humanity--

00:21:34.700 --> 00:21:35.500 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:21:35.500 --> 00:21:37.630 align:middle line:84%
>>DE STEFANO: So we can
get it in a different way.

00:21:37.630 --> 00:21:38.430 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:21:38.430 --> 00:21:40.600 align:middle line:84%
>>DE STEFANO: We have
to think that humans,

00:21:40.600 --> 00:21:43.330 align:middle line:84%
besides our individual
consciousness,

00:21:43.330 --> 00:21:45.980 align:middle line:84%
we are basically
cells of a planet.

00:21:45.980 --> 00:21:48.460 align:middle line:84%
So we are evolving
cells in a planet

00:21:48.460 --> 00:21:52.330 align:middle line:84%
that we work as groups
in order to have synapses

00:21:52.330 --> 00:21:54.850 align:middle line:90%
so we can share information.

00:21:54.850 --> 00:21:59.490 align:middle line:84%
So when we are trying
to collectively like

00:21:59.490 --> 00:22:01.950 align:middle line:90%
an organism to--

00:22:01.950 --> 00:22:03.810 align:middle line:84%
we are trying to
transcend something

00:22:03.810 --> 00:22:06.390 align:middle line:84%
or to transform
something, we all

00:22:06.390 --> 00:22:09.600 align:middle line:90%
have to have the same action.

00:22:09.600 --> 00:22:12.360 align:middle line:84%
We all have to have
the same reaction.

00:22:12.360 --> 00:22:14.760 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Yeah, collectively
agreed upon reality.

00:22:14.760 --> 00:22:15.750 align:middle line:84%
>>DE STEFANO: To
transform the whole thing.

00:22:15.750 --> 00:22:16.550 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:22:16.550 --> 00:22:20.100 align:middle line:84%
>>DE STEFANO: So when
you suffer yourself,

00:22:20.100 --> 00:22:22.830 align:middle line:84%
you are changing one
concept of your own group.

00:22:22.830 --> 00:22:30.240 align:middle line:84%
When you have a massive thing
can transcend that all together

00:22:30.240 --> 00:22:32.980 align:middle line:90%
as a big organism.

00:22:32.980 --> 00:22:36.330 align:middle line:10%
So let's say, for
example, we don't usually

00:22:36.330 --> 00:22:39.900 align:middle line:10%
think about this, but every one
of our organs inside our body,

00:22:39.900 --> 00:22:45.090 align:middle line:10%
imagine that every cell in that
organ is like a whole culture.

00:22:45.090 --> 00:22:58.270 align:middle line:84%
So if you drink Coke, let's
say, every day, for example,

00:22:58.270 --> 00:23:02.220 align:middle line:84%
your liver will start to say,
hey, I cannot handle this.

00:23:02.220 --> 00:23:05.640 align:middle line:90%
Maybe once a week I can.

00:23:05.640 --> 00:23:08.220 align:middle line:84%
So it's the organism,
the whole organism

00:23:08.220 --> 00:23:10.450 align:middle line:90%
that will start to suffer.

00:23:10.450 --> 00:23:13.900 align:middle line:84%
It's not just one
cell in that organism.

00:23:13.900 --> 00:23:16.140 align:middle line:84%
So the whole organism
will start to suffer,

00:23:16.140 --> 00:23:20.590 align:middle line:84%
and we'll start to suffer
the pain as a collective.

00:23:20.590 --> 00:23:25.920 align:middle line:84%
So the same thing happened in
the whole planet, with a group,

00:23:25.920 --> 00:23:28.140 align:middle line:90%
with a country, with a region.

00:23:28.140 --> 00:23:32.010 align:middle line:84%
So it's like an organ
feeling something

00:23:32.010 --> 00:23:35.843 align:middle line:84%
that is wrong that is
wrong and that we all

00:23:35.843 --> 00:23:37.260 align:middle line:84%
have to pay attention
because it's

00:23:37.260 --> 00:23:40.860 align:middle line:84%
a big part as an
organ inside a body.

00:23:40.860 --> 00:23:45.300 align:middle line:84%
So that memory creates
a transcendental idea

00:23:45.300 --> 00:23:48.960 align:middle line:84%
of a whole collective
mind that helps

00:23:48.960 --> 00:23:56.810 align:middle line:84%
to change faster something that
was stuck in that territory.

00:23:56.810 --> 00:24:02.690 align:middle line:84%
An earthquake, a war,
these kind of things

00:24:02.690 --> 00:24:05.510 align:middle line:84%
are something that
change completely.

00:24:05.510 --> 00:24:08.750 align:middle line:84%
As a massive suffering,
change completely

00:24:08.750 --> 00:24:11.810 align:middle line:84%
into another state
of consciousness.

00:24:11.810 --> 00:24:15.680 align:middle line:84%
I usually explain what happened
in the Second World War,

00:24:15.680 --> 00:24:18.870 align:middle line:84%
like it was horrible
what happened.

00:24:18.870 --> 00:24:23.790 align:middle line:84%
And what happened
took us to immediately

00:24:23.790 --> 00:24:28.000 align:middle line:84%
in a very fast way
to human rights,

00:24:28.000 --> 00:24:34.210 align:middle line:84%
to new countries being
born, to free speech--

00:24:34.210 --> 00:24:35.360 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: New technologies.

00:24:35.360 --> 00:24:36.652 align:middle line:90%
>>DE STEFANO: New technologies.

00:24:36.652 --> 00:24:40.600 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Also having people
moved around involuntarily who

00:24:40.600 --> 00:24:44.170 align:middle line:84%
started falling in love
and having children

00:24:44.170 --> 00:24:47.320 align:middle line:84%
and creating whole new
DNA strands and bloodlines

00:24:47.320 --> 00:24:49.240 align:middle line:90%
from people mixing blood.

00:24:49.240 --> 00:24:50.270 align:middle line:90%
Wars do that.

00:24:50.270 --> 00:24:51.070 align:middle line:90%
>>DE STEFANO: Yeah.

00:24:51.070 --> 00:24:57.390 align:middle line:84%
So it basically if that
war wouldn't happen,

00:24:57.390 --> 00:25:01.920 align:middle line:84%
we would be still like
if it is in the 1900s.

00:25:01.920 --> 00:25:04.260 align:middle line:84%
We would be still
living like that.

00:25:04.260 --> 00:25:05.940 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Yeah,
it's very true, yes.

00:25:05.940 --> 00:25:08.850 align:middle line:84%
>>DE STEFANO: So it was
a collective suffering

00:25:08.850 --> 00:25:13.690 align:middle line:84%
that pushed up the consciousness
of thousands of people.

00:25:13.690 --> 00:25:14.490 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:25:14.490 --> 00:25:16.440 align:middle line:84%
>>DE STEFANO: And transformed
the world in the way

00:25:16.440 --> 00:25:17.310 align:middle line:90%
we see it today.

00:25:17.310 --> 00:25:18.690 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And that
makes total sense.

00:25:18.690 --> 00:25:20.648 align:middle line:84%
Now let's look at where
you have everybody just

00:25:20.648 --> 00:25:21.460 align:middle line:90%
simply wiped out.

00:25:21.460 --> 00:25:22.260 align:middle line:90%
>>DE STEFANO: Yeah.

00:25:22.260 --> 00:25:24.270 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And now
everything's gone.

00:25:24.270 --> 00:25:25.270 align:middle line:90%
Your technology is gone.

00:25:25.270 --> 00:25:27.187 align:middle line:84%
Everything's gone except
your soul, of course.

00:25:27.187 --> 00:25:29.850 align:middle line:84%
I mean, the spirit still exists,
but the rest of everything

00:25:29.850 --> 00:25:30.930 align:middle line:90%
is pretty much gone.

00:25:30.930 --> 00:25:31.730 align:middle line:90%
>>DE STEFANO: Yeah.

00:25:31.730 --> 00:25:33.420 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So now
what is the benefit

00:25:33.420 --> 00:25:36.950 align:middle line:84%
in that where you have
kind of a total wipeout?

00:25:36.950 --> 00:25:37.950 align:middle line:90%
>>DE STEFANO: Like what?

00:25:37.950 --> 00:25:42.030 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: A wipeout, where most
of the population is gone from

00:25:42.030 --> 00:25:43.020 align:middle line:90%
a large region in--

00:25:43.020 --> 00:25:44.853 align:middle line:84%
>>DE STEFANO: Some
periods of time happened.

00:25:44.853 --> 00:25:48.120 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Mass extinctions,
inundations, the Great Flood,

00:25:48.120 --> 00:25:51.030 align:middle line:84%
the Atlantean
destructions, and such.

00:25:51.030 --> 00:25:54.540 align:middle line:84%
Where do you see looking
back as the benefit

00:25:54.540 --> 00:25:56.550 align:middle line:84%
of those destructions
compared to something

00:25:56.550 --> 00:25:58.710 align:middle line:84%
like World War II,
which simply opened

00:25:58.710 --> 00:26:01.440 align:middle line:90%
a lot of different doors?

00:26:01.440 --> 00:26:05.400 align:middle line:84%
>>DE STEFANO: Well, that's a
problem that usually Christians

00:26:05.400 --> 00:26:06.330 align:middle line:90%
have.

00:26:06.330 --> 00:26:07.430 align:middle line:90%
Sorry.

00:26:07.430 --> 00:26:08.940 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: No, speak freely.

00:26:08.940 --> 00:26:15.690 align:middle line:84%
>>DE STEFANO: Yeah, so usually
Christianity and also but--

00:26:15.690 --> 00:26:18.810 align:middle line:84%
Christianity comes from
Judaism and also share

00:26:18.810 --> 00:26:20.470 align:middle line:90%
the same root with Islam.

00:26:20.470 --> 00:26:21.270 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:26:21.270 --> 00:26:23.190 align:middle line:84%
>>DE STEFANO: Those
main religions

00:26:23.190 --> 00:26:27.600 align:middle line:84%
has been designed
in a way of thinking

00:26:27.600 --> 00:26:30.600 align:middle line:84%
that there is a paradise
where everything is fine,

00:26:30.600 --> 00:26:32.580 align:middle line:90%
and that's our goal.

00:26:32.580 --> 00:26:34.783 align:middle line:84%
And we come from
suffering, and we

00:26:34.783 --> 00:26:36.450 align:middle line:84%
have to escape from
suffering because it

00:26:36.450 --> 00:26:39.000 align:middle line:84%
was a punishment from God, and
we have to escape from that.

00:26:39.000 --> 00:26:40.600 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Oh, I was
raised that way.

00:26:40.600 --> 00:26:40.800 align:middle line:90%
>>DE STEFANO: OK.

00:26:40.800 --> 00:26:42.030 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Yeah, I
know about that.

00:26:42.030 --> 00:26:42.863 align:middle line:90%
>>DE STEFANO: Even--

00:26:42.863 --> 00:26:44.905 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: I didn't believe it.

00:26:44.905 --> 00:26:47.280 align:middle line:84%
>>DE STEFANO: Even though your
cells had the environment.

00:26:47.280 --> 00:26:47.940 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: That's right.

00:26:47.940 --> 00:26:48.690 align:middle line:84%
>>DE STEFANO: Like
going to church

00:26:48.690 --> 00:26:51.540 align:middle line:84%
or listening to this kind of
things or going to synagogue,

00:26:51.540 --> 00:26:53.880 align:middle line:84%
and this kind of
thoughts like we

00:26:53.880 --> 00:26:56.820 align:middle line:84%
came from suffering because
God punished us because we did

00:26:56.820 --> 00:27:00.000 align:middle line:84%
something wrong, and now we
have to go to the Paradise

00:27:00.000 --> 00:27:04.240 align:middle line:84%
and do good things in
order to get inside.

00:27:04.240 --> 00:27:08.460 align:middle line:84%
So this kind of thoughts
had created an idea

00:27:08.460 --> 00:27:12.570 align:middle line:84%
that we are suffering and
we have to escape suffering.

00:27:12.570 --> 00:27:18.820 align:middle line:84%
But when you go to Asia, India,
and stuff, it's not like that.

00:27:18.820 --> 00:27:22.142 align:middle line:84%
It's like, oh, yeah, Shiva
is the destroyer of things--

00:27:22.142 --> 00:27:23.100 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: That's right.

00:27:23.100 --> 00:27:24.975 align:middle line:84%
>>DE STEFANO: So we can
create something new.

00:27:24.975 --> 00:27:25.790 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Exactly.

00:27:25.790 --> 00:27:27.700 align:middle line:84%
So let's get into
that, these periods

00:27:27.700 --> 00:27:30.760 align:middle line:84%
where you've gained a
certain amount of evolution

00:27:30.760 --> 00:27:34.480 align:middle line:84%
as a species, a certain amount
of technological advancement,

00:27:34.480 --> 00:27:37.210 align:middle line:84%
and it's taken
away or it's gone.

00:27:37.210 --> 00:27:38.360 align:middle line:90%
It's suddenly gone.

00:27:38.360 --> 00:27:41.440 align:middle line:84%
So when you look at this from
a multi-dimensional point

00:27:41.440 --> 00:27:45.730 align:middle line:84%
of view, would you say it's
because that epoch period

00:27:45.730 --> 00:27:47.680 align:middle line:84%
of history had reached
the height of what it

00:27:47.680 --> 00:27:49.780 align:middle line:90%
was capable of and that was it.

00:27:49.780 --> 00:27:51.550 align:middle line:84%
It wasn't going to go
any further anyway?

00:27:51.550 --> 00:27:53.258 align:middle line:84%
>>DE STEFANO: Yeah,
it was just a period.

00:27:53.258 --> 00:27:56.200 align:middle line:84%
It's like the frequency
has the-- sorry,

00:27:56.200 --> 00:27:58.490 align:middle line:90%
the vibration has frequencies.

00:27:58.490 --> 00:28:04.045 align:middle line:84%
So you should never go this way
because this is not natural.

00:28:04.045 --> 00:28:05.630 align:middle line:84%
The natural thing
is the harmony--

00:28:05.630 --> 00:28:06.430 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:28:06.430 --> 00:28:08.138 align:middle line:84%
>>DE STEFANO: In
frequency and vibration.

00:28:08.138 --> 00:28:11.440 align:middle line:84%
We wouldn't be able to
talk without the silence.

00:28:11.440 --> 00:28:13.960 align:middle line:84%
We wouldn't be
able to have music

00:28:13.960 --> 00:28:16.185 align:middle line:84%
without the silence,
this kind of thing.

00:28:16.185 --> 00:28:18.310 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Same in the body,
as you say, cellularly.

00:28:18.310 --> 00:28:18.400 align:middle line:90%
>>DE STEFANO: Yeah.

00:28:18.400 --> 00:28:20.110 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: The anabolism
and catabolism

00:28:20.110 --> 00:28:21.580 align:middle line:90%
of every cell, life and death.

00:28:21.580 --> 00:28:23.650 align:middle line:84%
>>DE STEFANO: You wouldn't
enjoy the sun without the night.

00:28:23.650 --> 00:28:23.950 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah, exactly.

00:28:23.950 --> 00:28:25.492 align:middle line:84%
>>DE STEFANO: And
this kind of thing.

00:28:25.492 --> 00:28:27.890 align:middle line:84%
So sometimes--
everything has a period.

00:28:27.890 --> 00:28:32.260 align:middle line:84%
So we evolve into a
state of consciousness,

00:28:32.260 --> 00:28:34.750 align:middle line:84%
and then we have to change
it to create a new one.

00:28:34.750 --> 00:28:37.990 align:middle line:84%
Because when even if you
create the perfect system,

00:28:37.990 --> 00:28:42.200 align:middle line:84%
eventually it will be the
worst system if it keeps going.

00:28:42.200 --> 00:28:48.700 align:middle line:84%
So for example, feudalism was
a perfect system for Europe.

00:28:48.700 --> 00:28:52.750 align:middle line:84%
Kingdoms was a perfect
system for Middle East.

00:28:52.750 --> 00:28:56.150 align:middle line:84%
But in this period, we
say, those are bad things.

00:28:56.150 --> 00:28:56.950 align:middle line:90%
Why?

00:28:56.950 --> 00:28:59.230 align:middle line:84%
It's because we are
going into another wave,

00:28:59.230 --> 00:29:02.320 align:middle line:84%
into democracy or
something different that

00:29:02.320 --> 00:29:04.620 align:middle line:90%
is coming with networks.

00:29:04.620 --> 00:29:06.480 align:middle line:90%
And democracy is now old too.

00:29:06.480 --> 00:29:10.480 align:middle line:84%
It's not working anymore, so
we have to go to another thing.

00:29:10.480 --> 00:29:13.980 align:middle line:84%
So this kind of
things, It doesn't

00:29:13.980 --> 00:29:17.730 align:middle line:84%
mean that democracy wasn't good,
that republics wasn't good,

00:29:17.730 --> 00:29:21.300 align:middle line:84%
that kingdoms weren't good,
that feudalism wasn't good,

00:29:21.300 --> 00:29:22.920 align:middle line:90%
that dictatorship wasn't good.

00:29:22.920 --> 00:29:24.783 align:middle line:90%
It was the perfect--

00:29:24.783 --> 00:29:26.200 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Solution
in this moment.

00:29:26.200 --> 00:29:26.790 align:middle line:84%
>>DE STEFANO: Solution
in that moment.

00:29:26.790 --> 00:29:27.590 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:29:27.590 --> 00:29:29.940 align:middle line:84%
>>DE STEFANO: And there was
no other option that moment

00:29:29.940 --> 00:29:31.625 align:middle line:90%
because of the context.

00:29:31.625 --> 00:29:33.750 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And also the
consciousness of the people.

00:29:33.750 --> 00:29:34.738 align:middle line:90%
>>DE STEFANO: Yeah.

00:29:34.738 --> 00:29:36.780 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: In that region
at that time, of course.

00:29:36.780 --> 00:29:38.910 align:middle line:84%
>>DE STEFANO: So
everything has to be--

00:29:38.910 --> 00:29:44.430 align:middle line:84%
it's hard to say destroy when
we talk about these things,

00:29:44.430 --> 00:29:47.800 align:middle line:90%
but it needs to be transformed.

00:29:47.800 --> 00:29:49.930 align:middle line:84%
So change the form
into another thing.

00:29:49.930 --> 00:29:53.760 align:middle line:84%
And every time that
we change something

00:29:53.760 --> 00:29:56.490 align:middle line:84%
and we are used to that
previous something,

00:29:56.490 --> 00:30:00.540 align:middle line:84%
we suffer because we don't
like that change because that's

00:30:00.540 --> 00:30:01.800 align:middle line:90%
all what we knew.

00:30:01.800 --> 00:30:04.450 align:middle line:90%
The cells were used to that.

00:30:04.450 --> 00:30:07.170 align:middle line:84%
So that's why everything
is like a kind of a crisis

00:30:07.170 --> 00:30:08.850 align:middle line:90%
when we transform.

00:30:08.850 --> 00:30:11.010 align:middle line:84%
But when you see
the whole history,

00:30:11.010 --> 00:30:13.980 align:middle line:84%
it was because of
those changes that we

00:30:13.980 --> 00:30:17.130 align:middle line:90%
were able to be who we are now.

00:30:17.130 --> 00:30:20.730 align:middle line:84%
It was because of the
explosion in Sumatra

00:30:20.730 --> 00:30:24.990 align:middle line:84%
72,000 years ago that we
basically became humans

00:30:24.990 --> 00:30:26.320 align:middle line:90%
as we know today.

00:30:26.320 --> 00:30:28.650 align:middle line:84%
It was because of the
glaciation in Europe

00:30:28.650 --> 00:30:33.330 align:middle line:84%
that humans spread along
Asia and North America.

00:30:33.330 --> 00:30:36.930 align:middle line:84%
It was because of the drought
in Africa created in the Sahara

00:30:36.930 --> 00:30:41.720 align:middle line:84%
that people left the
rainforest and left

00:30:41.720 --> 00:30:44.750 align:middle line:90%
to the rest of the world.

00:30:44.750 --> 00:30:48.380 align:middle line:84%
The wars in Middle East, not
this one, but the first ones

00:30:48.380 --> 00:30:52.220 align:middle line:84%
were the ones taking people
to advances in technology,

00:30:52.220 --> 00:30:56.270 align:middle line:90%
in religion, in everything new.

00:30:56.270 --> 00:31:00.050 align:middle line:84%
The conflicts in the
Mediterranean Sea

00:31:00.050 --> 00:31:03.320 align:middle line:90%
created the Greek philosophy.

00:31:03.320 --> 00:31:09.770 align:middle line:84%
So everything that today we
see as, oh, that was horrible,

00:31:09.770 --> 00:31:12.440 align:middle line:84%
was what helped us to
be what we are now.

00:31:12.440 --> 00:31:16.100 align:middle line:84%
And people is complaining
about this time,

00:31:16.100 --> 00:31:19.070 align:middle line:84%
but actually this time
is the best time we had--

00:31:19.070 --> 00:31:20.210 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: It's true.

00:31:20.210 --> 00:31:21.710 align:middle line:84%
>>DE STEFANO: In the
whole history of humanity.

00:31:21.710 --> 00:31:22.877 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: That's what I say.

00:31:22.877 --> 00:31:25.340 align:middle line:84%
I mean, 100 years ago,
we would literally

00:31:25.340 --> 00:31:28.010 align:middle line:84%
watch somebody being
hung on a Saturday

00:31:28.010 --> 00:31:29.223 align:middle line:90%
afternoon for entertainment.

00:31:29.223 --> 00:31:30.140 align:middle line:90%
>>DE STEFANO: Exactly.

00:31:30.140 --> 00:31:32.150 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And think
it was interesting.

00:31:32.150 --> 00:31:34.550 align:middle line:84%
I mean, actually entertainment
watching a person suffer.

00:31:34.550 --> 00:31:36.380 align:middle line:90%
That was very, very recently.

00:31:36.380 --> 00:31:38.223 align:middle line:84%
In some parts of the
world, it still exists.

00:31:38.223 --> 00:31:39.140 align:middle line:90%
>>DE STEFANO: Exactly.

00:31:39.140 --> 00:31:40.473 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes, I agree with you.

00:31:40.473 --> 00:31:44.547 align:middle line:84%
>>DE STEFANO: So women couldn't
vote like, what, 50 years ago?

00:31:44.547 --> 00:31:45.505 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: 50 years ago.

00:31:45.505 --> 00:31:47.810 align:middle line:84%
It's like this half of
the world's population

00:31:47.810 --> 00:31:48.650 align:middle line:90%
didn't count.

00:31:48.650 --> 00:31:51.360 align:middle line:84%
Our minds, our thoughts,
our desires didn't matter.

00:31:51.360 --> 00:31:56.360 align:middle line:84%
>>DE STEFANO: So it's like we
are evolving so fast that we

00:31:56.360 --> 00:32:00.510 align:middle line:84%
cannot be aware of
how good we are.

00:32:00.510 --> 00:32:01.310 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:32:01.310 --> 00:32:04.460 align:middle line:84%
>>DE STEFANO: We cannot enjoy
the really good things that we

00:32:04.460 --> 00:32:07.715 align:middle line:84%
have accomplished because we are
thinking about the whole cares

00:32:07.715 --> 00:32:08.840 align:middle line:90%
that is in the world today.

00:32:08.840 --> 00:32:13.430 align:middle line:84%
And the only reason why we are
now understanding the conflicts

00:32:13.430 --> 00:32:15.710 align:middle line:90%
is because we have the internet.

00:32:15.710 --> 00:32:16.520 align:middle line:90%
Because--

00:32:16.520 --> 00:32:16.880 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: We're connected.

00:32:16.880 --> 00:32:18.470 align:middle line:84%
>>DE STEFANO: It always
happened, these kind of things.

00:32:18.470 --> 00:32:18.740 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:32:18.740 --> 00:32:20.100 align:middle line:84%
>>DE STEFANO: But we
were disconnected.

00:32:20.100 --> 00:32:22.517 align:middle line:84%
Now we are connected, we can
know everything that happens.

00:32:22.517 --> 00:32:24.500 align:middle line:84%
So that's why we say,
oh, this is a crazy time.

00:32:24.500 --> 00:32:25.763 align:middle line:90%
No--

00:32:25.763 --> 00:32:26.930 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: It's over mostly--

00:32:26.930 --> 00:32:28.722 align:middle line:84%
>>DE STEFANO: 2,000
years ago was a crazy--

00:32:28.722 --> 00:32:29.780 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Crazy time.

00:32:29.780 --> 00:32:31.910 align:middle line:84%
It's true, and mostly
it's just overwhelm

00:32:31.910 --> 00:32:34.880 align:middle line:84%
of being essentially
shocked by so much all

00:32:34.880 --> 00:32:36.560 align:middle line:84%
at once, all the
time, every day,

00:32:36.560 --> 00:32:38.720 align:middle line:84%
and it's our own doing
in our own choice

00:32:38.720 --> 00:32:40.240 align:middle line:84%
that we're allowing
that to happen.

00:32:40.240 --> 00:32:42.330 align:middle line:84%
You brought up
democracy a bit ago,

00:32:42.330 --> 00:32:44.870 align:middle line:84%
and I'm going to talk
to you about what

00:32:44.870 --> 00:32:47.090 align:middle line:90%
you see is what comes next.

00:32:47.090 --> 00:32:49.730 align:middle line:84%
Democracy in the truest
sense of the word

00:32:49.730 --> 00:32:52.050 align:middle line:90%
is every vote, every person.

00:32:52.050 --> 00:32:53.990 align:middle line:84%
Every person matters
on this planet.

00:32:53.990 --> 00:32:55.980 align:middle line:84%
That's the truest
sense of democracy.

00:32:55.980 --> 00:32:56.780 align:middle line:90%
It's not even--

00:32:56.780 --> 00:32:57.860 align:middle line:84%
>>DE STEFANO: The power
of the population.

00:32:57.860 --> 00:32:58.818 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: That's right.

00:32:58.818 --> 00:33:00.240 align:middle line:90%
It's not a political thing.

00:33:00.240 --> 00:33:03.890 align:middle line:84%
So looking at it in the
way that everyone matters,

00:33:03.890 --> 00:33:07.460 align:middle line:84%
where do you see the
planet kind of going?

00:33:07.460 --> 00:33:09.980 align:middle line:84%
Everybody talks
about the years 2027

00:33:09.980 --> 00:33:12.590 align:middle line:84%
and these years coming up where
changes are going to happen.

00:33:12.590 --> 00:33:16.640 align:middle line:84%
What do you see as
that next way of--

00:33:16.640 --> 00:33:18.890 align:middle line:84%
I won't even say
politics, but let's use

00:33:18.890 --> 00:33:20.210 align:middle line:90%
that as a substitute word.

00:33:20.210 --> 00:33:23.156 align:middle line:84%
>>DE STEFANO: Well, I
would say government.

00:33:23.156 --> 00:33:27.650 align:middle line:84%
Government means
to sail in Greek,

00:33:27.650 --> 00:33:30.230 align:middle line:84%
because the first
governments in the world

00:33:30.230 --> 00:33:35.870 align:middle line:84%
were basically the king or the
representative going on a boat

00:33:35.870 --> 00:33:38.180 align:middle line:90%
to talk to another island.

00:33:38.180 --> 00:33:42.410 align:middle line:84%
So that idea was like, we
are governing an island.

00:33:42.410 --> 00:33:43.310 align:middle line:90%
We're governing.

00:33:43.310 --> 00:33:45.740 align:middle line:84%
So they were sailing from
one island to another

00:33:45.740 --> 00:33:48.660 align:middle line:90%
and talking to the leaders.

00:33:48.660 --> 00:33:53.190 align:middle line:84%
So politics is basically
the organizational structure

00:33:53.190 --> 00:33:56.530 align:middle line:84%
of a city, a Polis,
which is a small place.

00:33:56.530 --> 00:33:59.380 align:middle line:84%
So we are now a network,
so politics doesn't work--

00:33:59.380 --> 00:34:00.180 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:34:00.180 --> 00:34:03.990 align:middle line:84%
>>DE STEFANO: Because we
tried to put our politics

00:34:03.990 --> 00:34:06.420 align:middle line:84%
with our morality,
which means the way

00:34:06.420 --> 00:34:10.409 align:middle line:84%
we see things in one place
into a different place.

00:34:10.409 --> 00:34:16.110 align:middle line:84%
Like for example, we cannot
say how the Americans telling

00:34:16.110 --> 00:34:17.530 align:middle line:90%
the Arabian people how to live.

00:34:17.530 --> 00:34:18.330 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:34:18.330 --> 00:34:19.425 align:middle line:90%
>>DE STEFANO: It's like--

00:34:19.425 --> 00:34:20.340 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: It doesn't work.

00:34:20.340 --> 00:34:21.120 align:middle line:84%
>>DE STEFANO: No,
it doesn't work.

00:34:21.120 --> 00:34:21.719 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: It's been proven.

00:34:21.719 --> 00:34:22.770 align:middle line:90%
It doesn't work.

00:34:22.770 --> 00:34:23.159 align:middle line:90%
>>DE STEFANO: Yes.

00:34:23.159 --> 00:34:25.469 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: The British trying to
tell the Indians how to live.

00:34:25.469 --> 00:34:26.280 align:middle line:90%
>>DE STEFANO: Yeah, exactly.

00:34:26.280 --> 00:34:27.280 align:middle line:90%
Yeah, it doesn't work.

00:34:27.280 --> 00:34:32.550 align:middle line:84%
So each one of us has a unique
way of understanding reality,

00:34:32.550 --> 00:34:33.969 align:middle line:90%
of understanding the world.

00:34:33.969 --> 00:34:36.239 align:middle line:84%
So that's different
politics and that's good.

00:34:36.239 --> 00:34:37.583 align:middle line:90%
But--

00:34:37.583 --> 00:34:39.750 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: What do you see
governmentally as in terms

00:34:39.750 --> 00:34:43.409 align:middle line:84%
of bodies that have to
have some sort of say

00:34:43.409 --> 00:34:44.670 align:middle line:90%
on behalf of the people?

00:34:44.670 --> 00:34:46.560 align:middle line:84%
>>DE STEFANO:
Governmentally, the problem

00:34:46.560 --> 00:34:51.100 align:middle line:84%
is that even if we have
kind of a democracy,

00:34:51.100 --> 00:34:52.980 align:middle line:90%
which is not really democracy.

00:34:52.980 --> 00:34:56.047 align:middle line:90%
I call it a fake feudalism.

00:34:56.047 --> 00:34:57.630 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Yeah, no,
I agree with that.

00:34:57.630 --> 00:34:59.310 align:middle line:84%
The way it's been
structured, yes.

00:34:59.310 --> 00:35:03.060 align:middle line:84%
>>DE STEFANO: It was
structured just because people

00:35:03.060 --> 00:35:05.280 align:middle line:84%
wanted to be part of
everything, so they

00:35:05.280 --> 00:35:06.460 align:middle line:90%
made it part of everything.

00:35:06.460 --> 00:35:09.680 align:middle line:84%
But they made it part of
feudalism, not democracy

00:35:09.680 --> 00:35:10.480 align:middle line:90%
really--

00:35:10.480 --> 00:35:11.313 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Very true.

00:35:11.313 --> 00:35:15.730 align:middle line:84%
>>DE STEFANO: As it was designed
in Greek times 3,000 years ago.

00:35:15.730 --> 00:35:18.930 align:middle line:84%
So we kind of think
that we have democracy.

00:35:18.930 --> 00:35:22.830 align:middle line:84%
But these times are trying to
show us something different.

00:35:22.830 --> 00:35:27.360 align:middle line:84%
Governments are a person that
sails to another government--

00:35:27.360 --> 00:35:30.900 align:middle line:84%
to another place, sorry,
another politics to talk

00:35:30.900 --> 00:35:34.190 align:middle line:90%
in regard of these people.

00:35:34.190 --> 00:35:37.930 align:middle line:84%
So these people choose
this person to go and talk.

00:35:37.930 --> 00:35:42.393 align:middle line:84%
Basically that's a politics of
democracy and a government--

00:35:42.393 --> 00:35:43.435 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Representation.

00:35:43.435 --> 00:35:44.977 align:middle line:84%
>>DE STEFANO: Yeah,
a representation.

00:35:44.977 --> 00:35:47.380 align:middle line:84%
And that worked for
thousands of years

00:35:47.380 --> 00:35:50.660 align:middle line:90%
because there was no phones.

00:35:50.660 --> 00:35:52.050 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:35:52.050 --> 00:35:55.240 align:middle line:84%
>>DE STEFANO: Basically
we haven't had internet.

00:35:55.240 --> 00:35:59.080 align:middle line:84%
Today, everyone has a
voice from the-- sorry,

00:35:59.080 --> 00:36:02.650 align:middle line:84%
but from the most stupid person
to the most clever person,

00:36:02.650 --> 00:36:04.768 align:middle line:90%
we all have a voice.

00:36:04.768 --> 00:36:06.310 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Even if
you're just filming

00:36:06.310 --> 00:36:07.870 align:middle line:90%
yourself popping bubblegum.

00:36:07.870 --> 00:36:08.320 align:middle line:90%
>>DE STEFANO: Exactly.

00:36:08.320 --> 00:36:08.830 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: You have a voice.

00:36:08.830 --> 00:36:09.460 align:middle line:90%
>>DE STEFANO: You have a voice.

00:36:09.460 --> 00:36:11.110 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And you could have
a million a lot of people

00:36:11.110 --> 00:36:13.313 align:middle line:84%
if you blow a big enough,
beautiful enough bubble.

00:36:13.313 --> 00:36:14.230 align:middle line:90%
>>DE STEFANO: Exactly.

00:36:14.230 --> 00:36:20.680 align:middle line:84%
So talking about representative
today, it's very old.

00:36:20.680 --> 00:36:22.420 align:middle line:84%
Because today, the
people that has

00:36:22.420 --> 00:36:25.540 align:middle line:84%
the solutions for the
population are not

00:36:25.540 --> 00:36:28.660 align:middle line:84%
politics, are people
that have solutions.

00:36:28.660 --> 00:36:30.550 align:middle line:84%
And people that
have solutions can

00:36:30.550 --> 00:36:32.320 align:middle line:84%
talk to other people
that has the problem

00:36:32.320 --> 00:36:34.240 align:middle line:90%
and eventually solve them.

00:36:34.240 --> 00:36:36.530 align:middle line:84%
It doesn't matter
where they live.

00:36:36.530 --> 00:36:40.870 align:middle line:84%
Which before, it was very
different, very complicated.

00:36:40.870 --> 00:36:44.230 align:middle line:84%
So I'm thinking
that the next step

00:36:44.230 --> 00:36:48.430 align:middle line:84%
is to create another system
that the Greeks have never

00:36:48.430 --> 00:36:52.880 align:middle line:84%
talked about because
they had an internet.

00:36:52.880 --> 00:36:54.670 align:middle line:84%
So all the different
types of government

00:36:54.670 --> 00:36:57.580 align:middle line:84%
have been designed in a
world that wasn't connected.

00:36:57.580 --> 00:36:58.570 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:36:58.570 --> 00:37:01.390 align:middle line:84%
>>DE STEFANO: And today we
have the tools to be connected,

00:37:01.390 --> 00:37:05.410 align:middle line:84%
to have a voice, and to be able
to create projects and solve

00:37:05.410 --> 00:37:08.830 align:middle line:84%
problems to people without
anyone representing them.

00:37:08.830 --> 00:37:11.770 align:middle line:90%


00:37:11.770 --> 00:37:13.630 align:middle line:84%
But in order to
get there, we need

00:37:13.630 --> 00:37:18.160 align:middle line:84%
to leave a huge crisis, which
is the crisis of the shepherd,

00:37:18.160 --> 00:37:20.930 align:middle line:90%
the crisis of being a sheep.

00:37:20.930 --> 00:37:21.730 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:37:21.730 --> 00:37:22.540 align:middle line:90%
>>DE STEFANO: Basically--

00:37:22.540 --> 00:37:23.170 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Behind--

00:37:23.170 --> 00:37:23.890 align:middle line:90%
>>DE STEFANO: Yeah, and--

00:37:23.890 --> 00:37:24.690 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:37:24.690 --> 00:37:30.010 align:middle line:84%
>>DE STEFANO: And I always love
to tell this to the people.

00:37:30.010 --> 00:37:32.650 align:middle line:84%
The only reason
why shepherds exist

00:37:32.650 --> 00:37:36.205 align:middle line:84%
is because the sheeps
believe they are sheeps,

00:37:36.205 --> 00:37:37.205 align:middle line:90%
so they need a shepherd.

00:37:37.205 --> 00:37:40.150 align:middle line:90%


00:37:40.150 --> 00:37:44.170 align:middle line:84%
So it's because
of the people not

00:37:44.170 --> 00:37:49.850 align:middle line:84%
dealing with their own conflicts
that we need governments today.

00:37:49.850 --> 00:37:50.650 align:middle line:90%
So--

00:37:50.650 --> 00:37:52.540 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And not wanting the
responsibility ultimately.

00:37:52.540 --> 00:37:52.840 align:middle line:90%
>>DE STEFANO: Exactly.

00:37:52.840 --> 00:37:54.770 align:middle line:84%
Responsibility is
the first thing.

00:37:54.770 --> 00:37:57.850 align:middle line:84%
So if we don't take our
own responsibilities,

00:37:57.850 --> 00:38:00.490 align:middle line:84%
always will come someone
to take the responsibility,

00:38:00.490 --> 00:38:04.360 align:middle line:84%
so we cannot blame a politician
by taking the responsibility.

00:38:04.360 --> 00:38:08.040 align:middle line:84%
And those people take the power
just because we allow them to.

00:38:08.040 --> 00:38:10.540 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So they're going to
become less and less relevant.

00:38:10.540 --> 00:38:11.340 align:middle line:90%
>>DE STEFANO: Yeah.

00:38:11.340 --> 00:38:13.180 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:38:13.180 --> 00:38:17.350 align:middle line:84%
>>DE STEFANO: But I guess one of
the things that we should do is

00:38:17.350 --> 00:38:20.405 align:middle line:84%
not fight against them, but
to build something different--

00:38:20.405 --> 00:38:21.280 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Underneath.

00:38:21.280 --> 00:38:22.080 align:middle line:90%
Absolutely.

00:38:22.080 --> 00:38:23.622 align:middle line:84%
>>DE STEFANO: Yeah,
so put our energy

00:38:23.622 --> 00:38:25.360 align:middle line:84%
in building something
new, and eventually

00:38:25.360 --> 00:38:27.220 align:middle line:90%
invite them to be part of it.

00:38:27.220 --> 00:38:29.860 align:middle line:84%
Because otherwise, you
create energy of conflict,

00:38:29.860 --> 00:38:31.355 align:middle line:90%
and you waste all the energy--

00:38:31.355 --> 00:38:32.230 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Absolutely.

00:38:32.230 --> 00:38:33.610 align:middle line:84%
>>DE STEFANO: Just
trying to survive again.

00:38:33.610 --> 00:38:35.470 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Whoever,
whatever is trying

00:38:35.470 --> 00:38:38.240 align:middle line:84%
to run a certain game
here, that's their game.

00:38:38.240 --> 00:38:40.120 align:middle line:84%
We don't have to play
the game anymore.

00:38:40.120 --> 00:38:41.203 align:middle line:90%
That's what you're saying.

00:38:41.203 --> 00:38:43.240 align:middle line:84%
We unplug from the game,
create the solutions,

00:38:43.240 --> 00:38:46.270 align:middle line:84%
connect together, become
a connected species,

00:38:46.270 --> 00:38:48.000 align:middle line:90%
which we are.

00:38:48.000 --> 00:38:51.410 align:middle line:84%
>>DE STEFANO: And also it's
important to know this,

00:38:51.410 --> 00:38:54.320 align:middle line:84%
there are countries and
regions in this world

00:38:54.320 --> 00:38:57.020 align:middle line:84%
or people in this world
that still need someone

00:38:57.020 --> 00:38:59.098 align:middle line:90%
to lead them.

00:38:59.098 --> 00:39:00.390 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: And leave it to that.

00:39:00.390 --> 00:39:01.340 align:middle line:90%
That's fine for that region.

00:39:01.340 --> 00:39:03.410 align:middle line:84%
>>DE STEFANO: They will
eventually get there,

00:39:03.410 --> 00:39:04.370 align:middle line:90%
they will eventually--

00:39:04.370 --> 00:39:05.170 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:39:05.170 --> 00:39:07.940 align:middle line:84%
>>DE STEFANO:
Understand that, but we

00:39:07.940 --> 00:39:11.420 align:middle line:84%
are still thinking as animals,
as mammals needed someone

00:39:11.420 --> 00:39:12.230 align:middle line:90%
to lead.

00:39:12.230 --> 00:39:14.250 align:middle line:90%
And that's not a bad thing.

00:39:14.250 --> 00:39:17.060 align:middle line:84%
It's just that we all feel
that we don't need them,

00:39:17.060 --> 00:39:19.500 align:middle line:84%
but we don't know how
to handle our own lives.

00:39:19.500 --> 00:39:23.690 align:middle line:84%
So that's why I used to call
the new system ontrocracy, which

00:39:23.690 --> 00:39:25.760 align:middle line:90%
is the power of the being.

00:39:25.760 --> 00:39:27.890 align:middle line:84%
In order to get there,
you have to acknowledge

00:39:27.890 --> 00:39:31.160 align:middle line:84%
that you have the power, and
not the power of the government,

00:39:31.160 --> 00:39:32.900 align:middle line:90%
the power of your own life.

00:39:32.900 --> 00:39:35.150 align:middle line:84%
And in order to that, you
have to change many things--

00:39:35.150 --> 00:39:38.310 align:middle line:84%
how you eat, how you live,
how you relate with others.

00:39:38.310 --> 00:39:44.140 align:middle line:84%
So it's a very long process
to get to ontrocracy.

00:39:44.140 --> 00:39:45.140 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: It's starting.

00:39:45.140 --> 00:39:45.470 align:middle line:90%
>>DE STEFANO: It's starting.

00:39:45.470 --> 00:39:47.012 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: All the
little young beings

00:39:47.012 --> 00:39:49.140 align:middle line:84%
that are being born have
different preferences,

00:39:49.140 --> 00:39:51.680 align:middle line:84%
different ways of learning
than what happened 20,

00:39:51.680 --> 00:39:53.790 align:middle line:90%
50, 100, 150 years ago.

00:39:53.790 --> 00:39:56.090 align:middle line:84%
It's already starting
with each generation.

00:39:56.090 --> 00:39:58.090 align:middle line:84%
>>DE STEFANO: Yeah,
it's a slow process.

00:39:58.090 --> 00:39:59.340 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: It's a slow process.

00:39:59.340 --> 00:40:01.430 align:middle line:84%
I don't think it's going to
be a revolution overnight.

00:40:01.430 --> 00:40:02.230 align:middle line:90%
It won't.

00:40:02.230 --> 00:40:04.310 align:middle line:84%
And I also want to bring
up the whole notion,

00:40:04.310 --> 00:40:05.990 align:middle line:84%
so we can talk about
it for a moment.

00:40:05.990 --> 00:40:11.330 align:middle line:84%
And that is the value in
having as Joan Grant called it,

00:40:11.330 --> 00:40:12.140 align:middle line:90%
far memory.

00:40:12.140 --> 00:40:15.410 align:middle line:84%
She had, like you,
splendid, detailed memories

00:40:15.410 --> 00:40:17.510 align:middle line:90%
of so many lifetimes as you do.

00:40:17.510 --> 00:40:19.430 align:middle line:84%
And as you bring
through your part,

00:40:19.430 --> 00:40:22.280 align:middle line:84%
you're bringing through what you
see, what you've experienced.

00:40:22.280 --> 00:40:23.750 align:middle line:84%
Other people are
bringing through

00:40:23.750 --> 00:40:25.550 align:middle line:84%
maybe from the same
period of history

00:40:25.550 --> 00:40:28.310 align:middle line:84%
where they were in the
story and what they see

00:40:28.310 --> 00:40:29.780 align:middle line:90%
and what they experienced.

00:40:29.780 --> 00:40:31.640 align:middle line:84%
And how important
it is for people

00:40:31.640 --> 00:40:35.240 align:middle line:84%
to start either
choosing to or allowing

00:40:35.240 --> 00:40:39.118 align:middle line:84%
themselves to understand they're
capable of it remembering--

00:40:39.118 --> 00:40:40.910 align:middle line:84%
because you and I were
talking off camera--

00:40:40.910 --> 00:40:44.240 align:middle line:84%
it's the tapestry of
everyone's memories together,

00:40:44.240 --> 00:40:46.160 align:middle line:84%
and you need some anchor
people like you that

00:40:46.160 --> 00:40:48.138 align:middle line:84%
have quite a lot of
memory to say, well,

00:40:48.138 --> 00:40:49.430 align:middle line:90%
this was kind of going on then.

00:40:49.430 --> 00:40:51.650 align:middle line:84%
So people can look at it
and say, oh, yeah, OK.

00:40:51.650 --> 00:40:53.010 align:middle line:90%
This is what I saw then too.

00:40:53.010 --> 00:40:53.810 align:middle line:90%
>>DE STEFANO: Yeah.

00:40:53.810 --> 00:40:56.060 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: To really start
understanding who we are

00:40:56.060 --> 00:40:57.990 align:middle line:90%
and what we've come from.

00:40:57.990 --> 00:41:01.340 align:middle line:84%
And so it's wonderful that
you've come in this lifetime

00:41:01.340 --> 00:41:04.550 align:middle line:84%
with far memory that encourages
other people to bring

00:41:04.550 --> 00:41:07.560 align:middle line:84%
their pieces and understanding
of those periods of time

00:41:07.560 --> 00:41:08.360 align:middle line:90%
to the table.

00:41:08.360 --> 00:41:09.650 align:middle line:90%
>>DE STEFANO: Yeah, there's--

00:41:09.650 --> 00:41:11.150 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Lots of
voices are needed.

00:41:11.150 --> 00:41:14.540 align:middle line:84%
>>DE STEFANO: Yeah,
there's no only one truth.

00:41:14.540 --> 00:41:15.500 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes, exactly.

00:41:15.500 --> 00:41:17.990 align:middle line:84%
>>DE STEFANO: There
is a fact that

00:41:17.990 --> 00:41:21.000 align:middle line:84%
has many ways of
seeing it as a truth.

00:41:21.000 --> 00:41:23.480 align:middle line:90%
So many truths, one fact.

00:41:23.480 --> 00:41:29.340 align:middle line:84%
And if you try to
explain the fact,

00:41:29.340 --> 00:41:31.220 align:middle line:84%
it won't be actually
the whole truth.

00:41:31.220 --> 00:41:34.612 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: No, because you can
say this happened at this time,

00:41:34.612 --> 00:41:36.320 align:middle line:84%
but there are 1,000
ways to interpret it.

00:41:36.320 --> 00:41:36.890 align:middle line:90%
>>DE STEFANO: Exactly.

00:41:36.890 --> 00:41:37.690 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:41:37.690 --> 00:41:41.120 align:middle line:84%
>>DE STEFANO: So that's
why I love to say,

00:41:41.120 --> 00:41:43.880 align:middle line:90%
what I say is not the truth.

00:41:43.880 --> 00:41:45.690 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: It is a perspective--

00:41:45.690 --> 00:41:47.150 align:middle line:84%
>>DE STEFANO:
Perspective, exactly.

00:41:47.150 --> 00:41:51.050 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And so this is another
one-- encouraging our children,

00:41:51.050 --> 00:41:53.280 align:middle line:84%
listening to our
little children.

00:41:53.280 --> 00:41:54.850 align:middle line:84%
These people have
memories they're

00:41:54.850 --> 00:41:55.850 align:middle line:90%
trying to bring through.

00:41:55.850 --> 00:41:57.800 align:middle line:84%
They just may not
have the exact words

00:41:57.800 --> 00:42:01.850 align:middle line:84%
that you understand and to
start encouraging people--

00:42:01.850 --> 00:42:04.640 align:middle line:84%
grandparents, parents,
friends of little children--

00:42:04.640 --> 00:42:06.650 align:middle line:84%
to start listening
to the things they're

00:42:06.650 --> 00:42:08.730 align:middle line:84%
saying about what
happened to them.

00:42:08.730 --> 00:42:09.530 align:middle line:90%
>>DE STEFANO: Yeah.

00:42:09.530 --> 00:42:12.113 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: It's really important
to give them the confidence so

00:42:12.113 --> 00:42:14.090 align:middle line:84%
by the time they reach
teenagers like you,

00:42:14.090 --> 00:42:16.680 align:middle line:84%
they can really full on
start taking on their memory.

00:42:16.680 --> 00:42:17.480 align:middle line:90%
>>DE STEFANO: Yeah.

00:42:17.480 --> 00:42:20.690 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So any thought
about that, about just

00:42:20.690 --> 00:42:23.254 align:middle line:84%
the importance of all of
us starting to remember?

00:42:23.254 --> 00:42:27.120 align:middle line:84%
>>DE STEFANO: Yes, we are
living memory of this planet.

00:42:27.120 --> 00:42:29.780 align:middle line:84%
We don't remember
just because our cells

00:42:29.780 --> 00:42:30.840 align:middle line:90%
are trying to protect us.

00:42:30.840 --> 00:42:31.640 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:42:31.640 --> 00:42:34.910 align:middle line:84%
>>DE STEFANO: So when we
start to open ourselves

00:42:34.910 --> 00:42:37.130 align:middle line:84%
to the memory, we
will eventually

00:42:37.130 --> 00:42:39.990 align:middle line:84%
know that we all have
the ability to remember.

00:42:39.990 --> 00:42:42.950 align:middle line:84%
It's not just a few of
us that can remember.

00:42:42.950 --> 00:42:46.190 align:middle line:84%
One of the reasons I was
able to remember in this life

00:42:46.190 --> 00:42:52.160 align:middle line:84%
is because I never had the
limitations in my environment

00:42:52.160 --> 00:42:54.497 align:middle line:90%
to say, that's wrong or shut up.

00:42:54.497 --> 00:42:55.580 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: And that's huge.

00:42:55.580 --> 00:42:57.200 align:middle line:90%
>>DE STEFANO: Yeah, that's huge.

00:42:57.200 --> 00:42:59.820 align:middle line:84%
I was born in an
agnostic family.

00:42:59.820 --> 00:43:02.450 align:middle line:84%
But even though they
didn't believe in anything,

00:43:02.450 --> 00:43:04.880 align:middle line:90%
they were open to creativity.

00:43:04.880 --> 00:43:07.650 align:middle line:90%
So my mother was an artist.

00:43:07.650 --> 00:43:12.260 align:middle line:84%
She was painting, and
she loved to read books.

00:43:12.260 --> 00:43:15.390 align:middle line:84%
I don't, but she
loved to read books.

00:43:15.390 --> 00:43:17.840 align:middle line:84%
And so when I start
to tell the stories,

00:43:17.840 --> 00:43:19.483 align:middle line:90%
she was able to listen to me--

00:43:19.483 --> 00:43:20.900 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Because
she loves story.

00:43:20.900 --> 00:43:22.490 align:middle line:84%
>>DE STEFANO: Yeah,
she loves stories,

00:43:22.490 --> 00:43:24.890 align:middle line:84%
she loved all the things
that I was sharing.

00:43:24.890 --> 00:43:27.225 align:middle line:84%
And she was like, oh,
and what happened?

00:43:27.225 --> 00:43:28.850 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Yeah, I
did that with my son.

00:43:28.850 --> 00:43:30.980 align:middle line:84%
It's wonderful to do
that, because there's

00:43:30.980 --> 00:43:32.600 align:middle line:90%
so much in the little child.

00:43:32.600 --> 00:43:34.040 align:middle line:84%
>>DE STEFANO:
Yeah, but sometimes

00:43:34.040 --> 00:43:36.470 align:middle line:84%
when we are conditioned
by our society

00:43:36.470 --> 00:43:38.660 align:middle line:84%
or don't talk this
with this person,

00:43:38.660 --> 00:43:46.850 align:middle line:84%
don't do this, or try to put
the memory or the thoughts

00:43:46.850 --> 00:43:51.440 align:middle line:84%
in only one current of thinking,
so you are conditioning

00:43:51.440 --> 00:43:55.100 align:middle line:90%
that person to forget.

00:43:55.100 --> 00:44:00.950 align:middle line:84%
So it's very important to
listen more than questioning.

00:44:00.950 --> 00:44:05.720 align:middle line:84%
Like listen to what they have to
say, not questioning or saying,

00:44:05.720 --> 00:44:07.670 align:middle line:84%
this is not like that
or this is not true.

00:44:07.670 --> 00:44:08.060 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:44:08.060 --> 00:44:10.460 align:middle line:84%
>>DE STEFANO: Or you are
kidding me and this kind of--

00:44:10.460 --> 00:44:12.543 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Don't try to
condition their experience.

00:44:12.543 --> 00:44:13.880 align:middle line:90%
>>DE STEFANO: Yeah, exactly.

00:44:13.880 --> 00:44:19.760 align:middle line:84%
And basically all the
geniuses, the people

00:44:19.760 --> 00:44:24.890 align:middle line:84%
that changed the
world, they did it

00:44:24.890 --> 00:44:28.130 align:middle line:84%
because they thought like
children, because they

00:44:28.130 --> 00:44:32.632 align:middle line:84%
had no limits in their minds and
they were playing with reality.

00:44:32.632 --> 00:44:34.340 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: In dream
time and this reality,

00:44:34.340 --> 00:44:35.757 align:middle line:84%
and they took them
both seriously.

00:44:35.757 --> 00:44:36.557 align:middle line:90%
>>DE STEFANO: Yeah.

00:44:36.557 --> 00:44:37.470 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Absolutely.

00:44:37.470 --> 00:44:38.887 align:middle line:84%
>>DE STEFANO: And
that's something

00:44:38.887 --> 00:44:43.940 align:middle line:84%
that is very important for
us to remember as adults.

00:44:43.940 --> 00:44:49.910 align:middle line:84%
Remember that you are children
still because we are constantly

00:44:49.910 --> 00:44:50.910 align:middle line:90%
learning.

00:44:50.910 --> 00:44:52.940 align:middle line:84%
It's not a moment that
we say, oh we are adults

00:44:52.940 --> 00:44:54.320 align:middle line:90%
and we know everything.

00:44:54.320 --> 00:44:58.820 align:middle line:84%
No, we learn until the day
we die, so we are constantly

00:44:58.820 --> 00:44:59.970 align:middle line:90%
children.

00:44:59.970 --> 00:45:05.840 align:middle line:84%
And if you allow the children
to keep being children

00:45:05.840 --> 00:45:11.460 align:middle line:84%
and playing with the mind and
games and using imagination.

00:45:11.460 --> 00:45:16.460 align:middle line:84%
Imagination is something that
it seems like our societies have

00:45:16.460 --> 00:45:19.530 align:middle line:90%
designed only for kids.

00:45:19.530 --> 00:45:21.830 align:middle line:84%
And when you become
a teenager, you

00:45:21.830 --> 00:45:24.183 align:middle line:84%
can't use imagination anymore
because you are getting--

00:45:24.183 --> 00:45:25.850 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: You need
to get down to facts.

00:45:25.850 --> 00:45:26.360 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:45:26.360 --> 00:45:27.943 align:middle line:84%
>>DE STEFANO: You
have to go to facts,

00:45:27.943 --> 00:45:30.770 align:middle line:84%
and you have to
make good at school.

00:45:30.770 --> 00:45:32.510 align:middle line:84%
And you have to pay
attention to this.

00:45:32.510 --> 00:45:36.740 align:middle line:84%
Don't go to the moon and
blah, blah with ideas.

00:45:36.740 --> 00:45:41.090 align:middle line:84%
So when we are 13,
14 years old, we

00:45:41.090 --> 00:45:44.340 align:middle line:84%
are started to be
killed by society

00:45:44.340 --> 00:45:48.320 align:middle line:84%
by telling us what is true,
what you should not think.

00:45:48.320 --> 00:45:50.780 align:middle line:84%
And when you stop
imagination, you

00:45:50.780 --> 00:45:53.340 align:middle line:84%
stop many minds that
are able to remember--

00:45:53.340 --> 00:45:54.140 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:45:54.140 --> 00:45:56.307 align:middle line:84%
>>DE STEFANO: To remember
not only the past but also

00:45:56.307 --> 00:45:57.110 align:middle line:90%
the future.

00:45:57.110 --> 00:45:59.402 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Yes, and we can
have a whole other discussion

00:45:59.402 --> 00:46:00.630 align:middle line:90%
about that next time.

00:46:00.630 --> 00:46:01.430 align:middle line:90%
>>DE STEFANO: Yeah.

00:46:01.430 --> 00:46:03.972 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: We're out of time,
but I want to ask you one thing.

00:46:03.972 --> 00:46:05.570 align:middle line:84%
You, Matias, the
kid in you, what

00:46:05.570 --> 00:46:08.420 align:middle line:84%
are some of the things
that just ground down

00:46:08.420 --> 00:46:09.825 align:middle line:90%
into the gravity of Earth life?

00:46:09.825 --> 00:46:12.200 align:middle line:84%
What are some of the things
you just love doing or eating

00:46:12.200 --> 00:46:13.000 align:middle line:90%
or whatever?

00:46:13.000 --> 00:46:13.850 align:middle line:90%
You, Matias.

00:46:13.850 --> 00:46:15.090 align:middle line:90%
>>DE STEFANO: I play a lot.

00:46:15.090 --> 00:46:17.882 align:middle line:90%
I love to still play like a kid.

00:46:17.882 --> 00:46:19.590 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So what kind
of play do you do?

00:46:19.590 --> 00:46:21.673 align:middle line:84%
>>DE STEFANO: Well, I love
to go play in the rain.

00:46:21.673 --> 00:46:23.240 align:middle line:84%
Like yesterday,
we took bicycles,

00:46:23.240 --> 00:46:27.030 align:middle line:84%
for example, and right in
the rain and going to cinema

00:46:27.030 --> 00:46:31.200 align:middle line:84%
and doing crazy stuff,
going to play games and--

00:46:31.200 --> 00:46:32.000 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:46:32.000 --> 00:46:34.610 align:middle line:90%
>>DE STEFANO: I don't know.

00:46:34.610 --> 00:46:39.410 align:middle line:10%
Do stuff with the mud or
I don't know, whatever--

00:46:39.410 --> 00:46:40.770 align:middle line:10%
>>REGINA: Anything that's play.

00:46:40.770 --> 00:46:41.570 align:middle line:90%
>>DE STEFANO: Yeah.

00:46:41.570 --> 00:46:42.440 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Play, imagination.

00:46:42.440 --> 00:46:44.107 align:middle line:84%
>>DE STEFANO: Going
always to new plays,

00:46:44.107 --> 00:46:45.740 align:middle line:90%
discover something new.

00:46:45.740 --> 00:46:47.990 align:middle line:84%
But maybe it's because my
moon is in Sagittarius.

00:46:47.990 --> 00:46:49.760 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Oh, well,
that's part of it.

00:46:49.760 --> 00:46:50.840 align:middle line:90%
It could be that simple.

00:46:50.840 --> 00:46:52.910 align:middle line:84%
>>DE STEFANO:
Yeah, but I usually

00:46:52.910 --> 00:46:55.140 align:middle line:84%
keep the inner child
very alive all the time.

00:46:55.140 --> 00:46:56.450 align:middle line:90%
I make a lot of jokes.

00:46:56.450 --> 00:46:59.942 align:middle line:84%
I lose some followers
because of that.

00:46:59.942 --> 00:47:01.400 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Keep on
losing followers.

00:47:01.400 --> 00:47:01.920 align:middle line:90%
It's OK.

00:47:01.920 --> 00:47:04.045 align:middle line:84%
>>DE STEFANO: Yeah, sometimes
I do that on purpose.

00:47:04.045 --> 00:47:05.450 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes, good.

00:47:05.450 --> 00:47:07.100 align:middle line:84%
If people are being
overly sensitive,

00:47:07.100 --> 00:47:08.570 align:middle line:84%
they're not getting
the message anyway.

00:47:08.570 --> 00:47:09.200 align:middle line:90%
Fabulous.

00:47:09.200 --> 00:47:09.590 align:middle line:90%
Well you do.

00:47:09.590 --> 00:47:12.500 align:middle line:84%
You have this wonderful playful,
very, very, very youthful-- you

00:47:12.500 --> 00:47:14.840 align:middle line:84%
are young, but even more
youthful energy about you

00:47:14.840 --> 00:47:16.040 align:middle line:90%
and a sparkle in your eyes.

00:47:16.040 --> 00:47:18.350 align:middle line:84%
So you can see that
you're constantly

00:47:18.350 --> 00:47:20.330 align:middle line:84%
remembering, renewing,
regenerating,

00:47:20.330 --> 00:47:21.990 align:middle line:84%
and that's a lovely
thing to see.

00:47:21.990 --> 00:47:24.170 align:middle line:84%
And it's lovely having
you with me on set,

00:47:24.170 --> 00:47:26.360 align:middle line:84%
and let's have another
conversation later maybe

00:47:26.360 --> 00:47:27.410 align:middle line:90%
about future.

00:47:27.410 --> 00:47:28.340 align:middle line:90%
>>DE STEFANO: Sure.

00:47:28.340 --> 00:47:29.140 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Thanks.

00:47:29.140 --> 00:47:31.730 align:middle line:10%
You can go to at least four
dozen other shows of Matias,

00:47:31.730 --> 00:47:34.370 align:middle line:10%
here on Gaia and dive
deeper into this and many

00:47:34.370 --> 00:47:35.480 align:middle line:10%
of his other topics.

00:47:35.480 --> 00:47:37.460 align:middle line:10%
