>>REGINA MEREDITH:
Few subjects are

00:00:18.351 --> 00:00:20.687 align:middle line:84%
more confusing to me
than that of finance.

00:00:20.687 --> 00:00:23.223 align:middle line:84%
It's a world that uses
a make-believe language

00:00:23.223 --> 00:00:24.858 align:middle line:90%
based on make-believe numbers.

00:00:24.858 --> 00:00:27.994 align:middle line:84%
Yet, we all have to interface
with the ripples it creates.

00:00:27.994 --> 00:00:29.629 align:middle line:90%
Sequestering has kicked in.

00:00:29.629 --> 00:00:32.132 align:middle line:84%
The debt is at
unimaginable levels.

00:00:32.132 --> 00:00:34.668 align:middle line:84%
Most new jobs being
offered are low-paying

00:00:34.668 --> 00:00:36.469 align:middle line:84%
and part-time, yet
the stock market

00:00:36.469 --> 00:00:39.639 align:middle line:84%
registers the illusion that
it's at its healthiest,

00:00:39.639 --> 00:00:41.441 align:middle line:90%
sitting at a near all-time high.

00:00:41.441 --> 00:00:43.410 align:middle line:84%
If something doesn't
make sense here,

00:00:43.410 --> 00:00:44.911 align:middle line:90%
it's because it shouldn't.

00:00:44.911 --> 00:00:47.380 align:middle line:84%
Andy Hoffman is here once
again to help us straighten out

00:00:47.380 --> 00:00:49.849 align:middle line:90%
the facts from fantasy.

00:00:49.849 --> 00:00:50.784 align:middle line:90%
Welcome, again.

00:00:50.784 --> 00:00:52.619 align:middle line:84%
It gets more
confusing by the day.

00:00:52.619 --> 00:00:54.220 align:middle line:84%
And I know I said
that the last time,

00:00:54.220 --> 00:00:56.322 align:middle line:90%
but it's not getting any better.

00:00:56.322 --> 00:00:59.092 align:middle line:84%
I saw this quote
on your site and I

00:00:59.092 --> 00:01:01.461 align:middle line:84%
want to read it because
it's so perfect.

00:01:01.461 --> 00:01:04.496 align:middle line:84%
It says, "The first panacea
for a mismanaged nation

00:01:04.496 --> 00:01:06.266 align:middle line:90%
is inflation of the currency.

00:01:06.266 --> 00:01:07.801 align:middle line:90%
The second is war.

00:01:07.801 --> 00:01:10.070 align:middle line:84%
Both bring a
temporary prosperity.

00:01:10.070 --> 00:01:11.871 align:middle line:90%
Both bring a permanent ruin.

00:01:11.871 --> 00:01:14.808 align:middle line:84%
But both are the refuge
of political and economic

00:01:14.808 --> 00:01:17.610 align:middle line:90%
opportunists," Ernest Hemingway.

00:01:17.610 --> 00:01:19.278 align:middle line:84%
>>ANDREW HOFFMAN:
Yeah, I like to sample

00:01:19.278 --> 00:01:21.414 align:middle line:90%
from outside the mainstream.

00:01:21.414 --> 00:01:23.016 align:middle line:84%
You get the best
quotes that way.

00:01:23.016 --> 00:01:24.384 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes, absolutely.

00:01:24.384 --> 00:01:27.220 align:middle line:84%
And that is so true because
we're involved in both.

00:01:27.220 --> 00:01:28.822 align:middle line:84%
I mean, there's
nothing but-- it seems

00:01:28.822 --> 00:01:31.290 align:middle line:84%
that markets are
nothing but opportunism

00:01:31.290 --> 00:01:33.659 align:middle line:84%
that benefit a
handful of characters.

00:01:33.659 --> 00:01:39.532 align:middle line:84%
And a few, maybe little geniuses
on the side that understand

00:01:39.532 --> 00:01:42.402 align:middle line:84%
algorithms in some kind
of strange and unique way.

00:01:42.402 --> 00:01:43.903 align:middle line:84%
But other than that,
it doesn't seem

00:01:43.903 --> 00:01:45.504 align:middle line:90%
to be benefiting anybody else.

00:01:45.504 --> 00:01:49.342 align:middle line:84%
And what I thought we'd talk
about first is sequestering.

00:01:49.342 --> 00:01:51.344 align:middle line:84%
What the heck does
that even mean?

00:01:51.344 --> 00:01:54.447 align:middle line:84%
We were talking off-camera,
what is sequestering?

00:01:54.447 --> 00:01:56.616 align:middle line:84%
As far as I can see,
it means budget cuts.

00:01:56.616 --> 00:01:59.052 align:middle line:84%
>>HOFFMAN: Well, we talked
about this briefly back

00:01:59.052 --> 00:02:01.154 align:middle line:84%
in November or December
when I was here.

00:02:01.154 --> 00:02:03.423 align:middle line:84%
And it all stems
back from-- which

00:02:03.423 --> 00:02:05.258 align:middle line:84%
most people listening
probably don't even

00:02:05.258 --> 00:02:08.828 align:middle line:84%
remember the Budget
Control Act of 2011.

00:02:08.828 --> 00:02:11.498 align:middle line:84%
Way back when, less
than 18 months ago when

00:02:11.498 --> 00:02:15.335 align:middle line:84%
we hit the debt limit,
and we couldn't come up

00:02:15.335 --> 00:02:17.871 align:middle line:84%
with any spending cuts there
was something called the Super

00:02:17.871 --> 00:02:20.306 align:middle line:84%
Committee that was supposed
to come up with spending cuts.

00:02:20.306 --> 00:02:22.609 align:middle line:84%
And they came up
with absolutely zero.

00:02:22.609 --> 00:02:26.079 align:middle line:84%
So in order to get the debt
ceiling increased-- at the time

00:02:26.079 --> 00:02:29.149 align:middle line:84%
it was, I believe,
$14.2 trillion.

00:02:29.149 --> 00:02:31.951 align:middle line:84%
To get it increased
to $16.4 trillion,

00:02:31.951 --> 00:02:37.557 align:middle line:84%
they agreed, OK, after the
elections in January 1, 2013,

00:02:37.557 --> 00:02:41.360 align:middle line:84%
we will have automatic
spending cuts of $185 billion.

00:02:41.360 --> 00:02:43.496 align:middle line:84%
That'll just kick the can
down the road a little.

00:02:43.496 --> 00:02:45.932 align:middle line:84%
Everyone will be happy and
we'll get through the election.

00:02:45.932 --> 00:02:51.070 align:middle line:84%
So they raised the debt
ceiling from $14.3 to $16.4.

00:02:51.070 --> 00:02:55.041 align:middle line:84%
Here we are today at $16.7
and rising because they just

00:02:55.041 --> 00:02:59.479 align:middle line:84%
delayed the debt ceiling until
May 19 in what I consider,

00:02:59.479 --> 00:03:04.651 align:middle line:84%
basically, child-- school yard
language that they said, yeah,

00:03:04.651 --> 00:03:06.386 align:middle line:90%
sure we'll just delay it.

00:03:06.386 --> 00:03:10.223 align:middle line:84%
And of course, these budget cuts
were set to hit on January 1.

00:03:10.223 --> 00:03:11.824 align:middle line:84%
But then they
kicked the can again

00:03:11.824 --> 00:03:17.197 align:middle line:84%
with what was called the fiscal
cliff deal, if you remember,

00:03:17.197 --> 00:03:20.098 align:middle line:84%
where Congress actually
worked into the late hours

00:03:20.098 --> 00:03:22.368 align:middle line:84%
of New Year's Eve
to delay it again.

00:03:22.368 --> 00:03:23.735 align:middle line:90%
This time, to March 1.

00:03:23.735 --> 00:03:24.504 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: To put it off again.

00:03:24.504 --> 00:03:25.572 align:middle line:90%
>>HOFFMAN: Until March 1.

00:03:25.572 --> 00:03:28.041 align:middle line:84%
Except this time,
instead of $185 billion,

00:03:28.041 --> 00:03:29.309 align:middle line:90%
it's only $85 billion.

00:03:29.309 --> 00:03:31.010 align:middle line:90%
So they got rid of half of it.

00:03:31.010 --> 00:03:35.715 align:middle line:84%
And here we are, March 1 came
around and sadly, $85 billion

00:03:35.715 --> 00:03:40.119 align:middle line:84%
out of a $3.8 trillion
budget is being cut out.

00:03:40.119 --> 00:03:43.223 align:middle line:84%
Of course, it's going to take
eight months to cut that out.

00:03:43.223 --> 00:03:44.958 align:middle line:84%
And most of it is
government jobs.

00:03:44.958 --> 00:03:48.761 align:middle line:84%
But the fact is, they basically
have kicked the can completely.

00:03:48.761 --> 00:03:50.597 align:middle line:84%
And now, May 19,
they're going to have

00:03:50.597 --> 00:03:52.699 align:middle line:84%
to make another decision
on the debt ceiling,

00:03:52.699 --> 00:03:56.669 align:middle line:84%
to either raise it again
well past $16.7 trillion.

00:03:56.669 --> 00:03:59.105 align:middle line:84%
But possibly, to get
rid of it entirely.

00:03:59.105 --> 00:04:04.310 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So all of the chat on
Capitol Hill about the budget

00:04:04.310 --> 00:04:06.579 align:middle line:84%
and about what should be cut
and what shouldn't be cut

00:04:06.579 --> 00:04:08.047 align:middle line:90%
and so forth is a charade?

00:04:08.047 --> 00:04:09.115 align:middle line:90%
I mean--

00:04:09.115 --> 00:04:10.583 align:middle line:84%
>>HOFFMAN: They're
not cutting anything.

00:04:10.583 --> 00:04:13.620 align:middle line:84%
What they're doing is cutting
the increase in spending.

00:04:13.620 --> 00:04:14.921 align:middle line:90%
That's what they call a cut.

00:04:14.921 --> 00:04:16.122 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Oh, I see.

00:04:16.122 --> 00:04:18.992 align:middle line:84%
>>HOFFMAN: And actually,
I saw yesterday Paul Ryan,

00:04:18.992 --> 00:04:22.295 align:middle line:84%
who might be among the most
despicable of all the people.

00:04:22.295 --> 00:04:24.564 align:middle line:84%
And sadly, is
probably going to be

00:04:24.564 --> 00:04:28.134 align:middle line:84%
the next Republican candidate
for president in 2016.

00:04:28.134 --> 00:04:34.040 align:middle line:84%
He just proposed a budget that
makes the increase in 2013 only

00:04:34.040 --> 00:04:35.575 align:middle line:90%
3.5%.

00:04:35.575 --> 00:04:40.380 align:middle line:84%
But that's assuming that
we get rid of Obamacare

00:04:40.380 --> 00:04:42.749 align:middle line:90%
after we just re-elected Obama.

00:04:42.749 --> 00:04:43.883 align:middle line:90%
It's just so ridiculous.

00:04:43.883 --> 00:04:46.085 align:middle line:84%
It's just a lot of
petty in-fighting.

00:04:46.085 --> 00:04:48.421 align:middle line:84%
The fact is that the spending
is going to keep going up.

00:04:48.421 --> 00:04:50.023 align:middle line:84%
The deficit is going
to keep going up.

00:04:50.023 --> 00:04:51.891 align:middle line:84%
And of course, you
have interest rates.

00:04:51.891 --> 00:04:54.560 align:middle line:84%
Remember, we have them
at record low levels

00:04:54.560 --> 00:04:56.796 align:middle line:84%
because the Fed
placed them there five

00:04:56.796 --> 00:04:59.399 align:middle line:84%
or seven years ago, which has
created all this inflation

00:04:59.399 --> 00:05:01.100 align:middle line:90%
and destroyed all the savers.

00:05:01.100 --> 00:05:02.869 align:middle line:84%
But now they're
starting to creep up,

00:05:02.869 --> 00:05:05.571 align:middle line:84%
which is why they
announced QE3 and QE4.

00:05:05.571 --> 00:05:07.974 align:middle line:84%
But for every 1% increase
in interest rates,

00:05:07.974 --> 00:05:11.944 align:middle line:84%
that adds $170 billion
to annual interest costs.

00:05:11.944 --> 00:05:14.747 align:middle line:84%
So the fact is they're between
a rock and a hard place.

00:05:14.747 --> 00:05:17.817 align:middle line:84%
They have to keep printing
money to keep the interest

00:05:17.817 --> 00:05:18.951 align:middle line:90%
rates down.

00:05:18.951 --> 00:05:21.921 align:middle line:84%
At the same time, the
inflation keeps rising.

00:05:21.921 --> 00:05:23.456 align:middle line:84%
And we're seeing it
in everyday life.

00:05:23.456 --> 00:05:25.658 align:middle line:84%
And it will continue
to increase.

00:05:28.528 --> 00:05:30.363 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: I said in
the open of this,

00:05:30.363 --> 00:05:31.798 align:middle line:90%
this is a make-believe world.

00:05:31.798 --> 00:05:34.634 align:middle line:84%
When you're talking about
such astronomical numbers

00:05:34.634 --> 00:05:41.240 align:middle line:84%
as now being 16, 17, 18-- and
growing-- trillion in debt.

00:05:41.240 --> 00:05:45.411 align:middle line:84%
Now, it was only a decade ago
that we were counting only

00:05:45.411 --> 00:05:48.414 align:middle line:84%
in the-- under
$500 billion mark.

00:05:48.414 --> 00:05:51.617 align:middle line:84%
That was even in 2007
as I recall reading.

00:05:51.617 --> 00:05:53.653 align:middle line:84%
We have gone from
a half a billion,

00:05:53.653 --> 00:05:56.089 align:middle line:84%
which we considered
atrocious at the time,

00:05:56.089 --> 00:05:59.959 align:middle line:84%
to basically turning a
blind eye to $17 trillion.

00:05:59.959 --> 00:06:02.095 align:middle line:84%
So in this make-believe
world, at what point

00:06:02.095 --> 00:06:03.930 align:middle line:84%
does this not even
matter anymore?

00:06:03.930 --> 00:06:07.333 align:middle line:84%
No number of generations
could ever pay off that debt.

00:06:07.333 --> 00:06:08.134 align:middle line:90%
>>HOFFMAN: Right.

00:06:08.134 --> 00:06:10.236 align:middle line:90%
Well, let's go back to 1971.

00:06:10.236 --> 00:06:12.772 align:middle line:84%
Specifically, August
15, which was the day we

00:06:12.772 --> 00:06:14.607 align:middle line:90%
went off the gold standard.

00:06:14.607 --> 00:06:16.809 align:middle line:84%
It was essentially the day
the entire world went off

00:06:16.809 --> 00:06:20.580 align:middle line:84%
the gold standard because the
Bretton Woods Agreement in 1944

00:06:20.580 --> 00:06:23.216 align:middle line:84%
essentially pegged all
currencies to the dollar,

00:06:23.216 --> 00:06:26.185 align:middle line:84%
and the dollar to
gold at $35 an ounce.

00:06:26.185 --> 00:06:28.488 align:middle line:84%
In 1971, when we went
off the gold standard,

00:06:28.488 --> 00:06:31.057 align:middle line:84%
basically because we
were overspending,

00:06:31.057 --> 00:06:32.658 align:middle line:90%
we had debt, this nation of--

00:06:32.658 --> 00:06:34.227 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Yeah, we
wanted to cut bait

00:06:34.227 --> 00:06:36.496 align:middle line:84%
from anything that had
accountability to it.

00:06:36.496 --> 00:06:37.997 align:middle line:84%
>>HOFFMAN: Yeah,
because we wanted--

00:06:37.997 --> 00:06:38.998 align:middle line:90%
you had Lyndon Johnson.

00:06:38.998 --> 00:06:41.100 align:middle line:84%
He had his great
society, which is well

00:06:41.100 --> 00:06:42.668 align:middle line:90%
for spending in the Vietnam War.

00:06:42.668 --> 00:06:45.738 align:middle line:84%
And then Nixon came in
and he inherited all that.

00:06:45.738 --> 00:06:47.407 align:middle line:84%
And he had no interest
in stopping it,

00:06:47.407 --> 00:06:48.708 align:middle line:90%
so that was the way to go.

00:06:48.708 --> 00:06:50.743 align:middle line:84%
And the rest of the
world didn't fight back.

00:06:50.743 --> 00:06:54.380 align:middle line:84%
But at that time, the United
States had $300 billion

00:06:54.380 --> 00:06:58.184 align:middle line:84%
of debt, which it had
accrued over 200 years.

00:06:58.184 --> 00:06:59.218 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:06:59.218 --> 00:07:00.853 align:middle line:84%
>>HOFFMAN: Now it
has $16.7 trillion.

00:07:00.853 --> 00:07:03.022 align:middle line:84%
But of course, that's only
the part they tell you.

00:07:03.022 --> 00:07:04.857 align:middle line:84%
Fannie Mae and Freddie
Mac, if you remember,

00:07:04.857 --> 00:07:06.192 align:middle line:90%
were nationalized.

00:07:06.192 --> 00:07:08.394 align:middle line:84%
They have $5 trillion of
debt, but they consider that

00:07:08.394 --> 00:07:09.328 align:middle line:90%
off balance sheet.

00:07:09.328 --> 00:07:11.631 align:middle line:84%
So it's really
more like 21-plus.

00:07:11.631 --> 00:07:14.000 align:middle line:84%
And then of course, you
have unfunded liabilities,

00:07:14.000 --> 00:07:17.770 align:middle line:84%
which have been estimated
as high as $220 trillion

00:07:17.770 --> 00:07:19.105 align:middle line:90%
and rising each year.

00:07:19.105 --> 00:07:21.140 align:middle line:84%
So there are going
to be painful cuts.

00:07:21.140 --> 00:07:23.943 align:middle line:84%
And you say, when
does it not matter?

00:07:23.943 --> 00:07:26.145 align:middle line:84%
It matters when
confidence is lost.

00:07:26.145 --> 00:07:29.214 align:middle line:84%
Because fiat currency
systems are, by definition,

00:07:29.214 --> 00:07:30.583 align:middle line:90%
Ponzi schemes.

00:07:30.583 --> 00:07:33.786 align:middle line:84%
A Ponzi scheme simply means
something that must grow larger

00:07:33.786 --> 00:07:36.556 align:middle line:84%
to survive and it
depends on confidence.

00:07:36.556 --> 00:07:38.958 align:middle line:84%
So people have to believe
that the dollar could spend

00:07:38.958 --> 00:07:40.726 align:middle line:84%
and they have to keep
printing more of it.

00:07:40.726 --> 00:07:43.362 align:middle line:84%
That's why they do
QE1, 2, 3, 4, and why

00:07:43.362 --> 00:07:44.363 align:middle line:90%
they'll need to do more.

00:07:44.363 --> 00:07:47.200 align:middle line:84%
So it will matter
until it doesn't.

00:07:47.200 --> 00:07:48.835 align:middle line:90%
It won't matter until it does.

00:07:48.835 --> 00:07:52.405 align:middle line:84%
Because at some point, like
the other 599 fiat currencies

00:07:52.405 --> 00:07:54.040 align:middle line:90%
before it, it will collapse.

00:07:54.040 --> 00:07:55.541 align:middle line:90%
That and all of the rest.

00:07:55.541 --> 00:07:57.643 align:middle line:84%
Because remember, this is
the first time in history

00:07:57.643 --> 00:08:01.814 align:middle line:84%
not a single currency on
Earth is backed by anything.

00:08:01.814 --> 00:08:04.917 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So the government
and its relationship

00:08:04.917 --> 00:08:07.753 align:middle line:84%
with the media in
keeping the story

00:08:07.753 --> 00:08:10.289 align:middle line:84%
propelled forward, I was--
just before we came on,

00:08:10.289 --> 00:08:13.526 align:middle line:84%
I was looking at some of the
headlines in the "Financial

00:08:13.526 --> 00:08:14.694 align:middle line:90%
Times" this morning.

00:08:14.694 --> 00:08:16.295 align:middle line:90%
And everything here conflicts.

00:08:16.295 --> 00:08:20.032 align:middle line:84%
If you read the
top headline, it's

00:08:20.032 --> 00:08:21.901 align:middle line:84%
going to conflict with
the one underneath it.

00:08:21.901 --> 00:08:23.703 align:middle line:84%
How can all of these
things be true?

00:08:23.703 --> 00:08:26.472 align:middle line:84%
Dow may be on the
hottest streak in years.

00:08:26.472 --> 00:08:30.476 align:middle line:84%
And then the next one
says, "Out of a Job?

00:08:30.476 --> 00:08:32.478 align:middle line:90%
Five Good Strategies."

00:08:32.478 --> 00:08:33.746 align:middle line:90%
And on and on.

00:08:33.746 --> 00:08:36.248 align:middle line:84%
Every single thing contradicts
the one right before it.

00:08:36.248 --> 00:08:38.050 align:middle line:84%
>>HOFFMAN: Well, it's
the mainstream media.

00:08:38.050 --> 00:08:40.953 align:middle line:84%
I mean, they are
notorious for some

00:08:40.953 --> 00:08:42.388 align:middle line:84%
of them being part
of the system.

00:08:42.388 --> 00:08:44.056 align:middle line:84%
Let's say, like a
Rupert Murdoch type.

00:08:44.056 --> 00:08:45.191 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:08:45.191 --> 00:08:46.425 align:middle line:84%
>>HOFFMAN: And some of
them simply just kind

00:08:46.425 --> 00:08:48.427 align:middle line:84%
of being brainless and
just looking for whatever

00:08:48.427 --> 00:08:49.295 align:middle line:90%
gets ratings.

00:08:49.295 --> 00:08:50.563 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:08:50.563 --> 00:08:53.032 align:middle line:84%
>>HOFFMAN: And as I
talk about all the time,

00:08:53.032 --> 00:08:55.902 align:middle line:84%
I get it from a mentor of
mine, the term market action

00:08:55.902 --> 00:08:57.169 align:middle line:90%
makes commentary.

00:08:57.169 --> 00:08:59.772 align:middle line:84%
If you can manipulate the
market, which every day it

00:08:59.772 --> 00:09:00.806 align:middle line:90%
does.

00:09:00.806 --> 00:09:01.507 align:middle line:84%
You know, I write
about it every day.

00:09:01.507 --> 00:09:02.808 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:09:02.808 --> 00:09:04.377 align:middle line:84%
>>HOFFMAN: You can pretty
much spin whatever news is.

00:09:04.377 --> 00:09:08.014 align:middle line:84%
I mean, you'll see one
day Dow up because of x.

00:09:08.014 --> 00:09:10.216 align:middle line:84%
And the next day, it will
say Dow down because of x,

00:09:10.216 --> 00:09:13.019 align:middle line:84%
simply because that was
the news of the day.

00:09:13.019 --> 00:09:15.821 align:middle line:90%
So why not spin it that way?

00:09:15.821 --> 00:09:17.390 align:middle line:84%
In a manipulated
market, no one even

00:09:17.390 --> 00:09:22.161 align:middle line:84%
knows reality from
the fraud anyway.

00:09:22.161 --> 00:09:23.896 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: But if
you're looking at it

00:09:23.896 --> 00:09:26.465 align:middle line:84%
and taking it all
in in one chunk,

00:09:26.465 --> 00:09:28.801 align:middle line:84%
it appears that
everything's fine.

00:09:28.801 --> 00:09:30.303 align:middle line:90%
Keep on spending.

00:09:30.303 --> 00:09:31.671 align:middle line:90%
There's no danger.

00:09:31.671 --> 00:09:34.040 align:middle line:84%
You're not in danger of losing
your way of life, though you

00:09:34.040 --> 00:09:37.877 align:middle line:84%
may have lost your home by now
and you may not have a job.

00:09:37.877 --> 00:09:41.614 align:middle line:84%
And in a sense, if you're just
looking at it psychologically,

00:09:41.614 --> 00:09:43.749 align:middle line:84%
people who said, I don't
want to hear about that.

00:09:43.749 --> 00:09:45.785 align:middle line:84%
I just want to keep
a good attitude

00:09:45.785 --> 00:09:48.354 align:middle line:90%
and keep my investments going.

00:09:48.354 --> 00:09:50.957 align:middle line:84%
Does that actually make
sense on some level,

00:09:50.957 --> 00:09:53.426 align:middle line:84%
if it's a con game anyway,
a confidence game anyway?

00:09:53.426 --> 00:09:54.794 align:middle line:90%
>>HOFFMAN: Yeah.

00:09:54.794 --> 00:09:58.965 align:middle line:84%
Well, as I write constantly,
all they have left-- the United

00:09:58.965 --> 00:10:00.800 align:middle line:84%
States, in particular,
has been hollowed out

00:10:00.800 --> 00:10:02.635 align:middle line:84%
because its manufacturing
is all gone.

00:10:02.635 --> 00:10:04.103 align:middle line:84%
But because of
the money printing

00:10:04.103 --> 00:10:07.940 align:middle line:84%
and all the bad policies
that have been made,

00:10:07.940 --> 00:10:10.509 align:middle line:84%
all that's left, really, is
what I call market manipulation,

00:10:10.509 --> 00:10:12.545 align:middle line:90%
money printing, and propaganda.

00:10:12.545 --> 00:10:16.949 align:middle line:84%
So it works to an extent in
that if you print enough money

00:10:16.949 --> 00:10:18.384 align:middle line:84%
and you manipulate
markets enough

00:10:18.384 --> 00:10:21.487 align:middle line:84%
and you tell enough lies,
that it buys you some time.

00:10:21.487 --> 00:10:24.290 align:middle line:84%
And again, most of
the world is not

00:10:24.290 --> 00:10:26.726 align:middle line:90%
incentivized to not believe it.

00:10:26.726 --> 00:10:28.894 align:middle line:84%
People say, well,
Andy, why don't people

00:10:28.894 --> 00:10:30.930 align:middle line:84%
believe you about
gold is suppressed

00:10:30.930 --> 00:10:32.064 align:middle line:90%
or the things you say?

00:10:32.064 --> 00:10:33.899 align:middle line:84%
I go, because it's not
in their best interest.

00:10:33.899 --> 00:10:35.735 align:middle line:84%
When you have
record entitlements.

00:10:35.735 --> 00:10:38.204 align:middle line:84%
When you have half of the
country on entitlements.

00:10:38.204 --> 00:10:41.240 align:middle line:84%
When you have 15% of the
country on food stamps,

00:10:41.240 --> 00:10:43.275 align:middle line:90%
do they want to listen to truth?

00:10:43.275 --> 00:10:45.378 align:middle line:84%
They want to listen to
someone that's going to say,

00:10:45.378 --> 00:10:46.345 align:middle line:90%
we will give you money.

00:10:46.345 --> 00:10:48.147 align:middle line:90%
Don't worry, everything's OK.

00:10:48.147 --> 00:10:49.515 align:middle line:90%
Because they have no choice.

00:10:49.515 --> 00:10:51.250 align:middle line:84%
They couldn't buy gold
if they wanted to.

00:10:51.250 --> 00:10:53.753 align:middle line:84%
Most of them couldn't buy food
to store up if they wanted to.

00:10:53.753 --> 00:10:55.855 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: But then there's
the whole middle class,

00:10:55.855 --> 00:10:58.724 align:middle line:84%
which is rapidly shrinking, who
does have a little money left.

00:10:58.724 --> 00:11:01.661 align:middle line:90%
And maybe even in the markets.

00:11:01.661 --> 00:11:04.230 align:middle line:84%
They've been watching and
grooming and carefully

00:11:04.230 --> 00:11:05.564 align:middle line:90%
trying to protect.

00:11:05.564 --> 00:11:11.003 align:middle line:84%
And for them, it would be
detrimental to their own psyche

00:11:11.003 --> 00:11:14.707 align:middle line:84%
in a sense to take their eye off
the ball and look at the truth.

00:11:14.707 --> 00:11:16.342 align:middle line:84%
You know, pull back
the layers and look

00:11:16.342 --> 00:11:18.177 align:middle line:84%
at the truth of what's
going on underneath.

00:11:18.177 --> 00:11:20.112 align:middle line:84%
If people were
actually educated,

00:11:20.112 --> 00:11:22.548 align:middle line:84%
what do you think would
happen if, right this moment,

00:11:22.548 --> 00:11:25.251 align:middle line:84%
the public became aware
of the true nature

00:11:25.251 --> 00:11:26.652 align:middle line:90%
of our economic condition?

00:11:26.652 --> 00:11:29.221 align:middle line:84%
>>HOFFMAN: Well, it's happened
in many parts of the world.

00:11:29.221 --> 00:11:31.457 align:middle line:84%
I mean, remember we have the
world's reserve currency,

00:11:31.457 --> 00:11:33.993 align:middle line:84%
so we're the highest
on the totem pole.

00:11:33.993 --> 00:11:37.430 align:middle line:84%
And therefore, we can withstand
all this inflation more

00:11:37.430 --> 00:11:38.664 align:middle line:90%
than most of the world.

00:11:38.664 --> 00:11:41.534 align:middle line:84%
We had the Arab Spring,
which is still going on now.

00:11:41.534 --> 00:11:42.635 align:middle line:90%
I mean, you look at Egypt.

00:11:42.635 --> 00:11:43.703 align:middle line:90%
They talk about democracy.

00:11:43.703 --> 00:11:46.005 align:middle line:90%
It's completely in chaos now.

00:11:46.005 --> 00:11:47.973 align:middle line:84%
And inflation has
a record level.

00:11:47.973 --> 00:11:50.009 align:middle line:84%
You see the protests going
on throughout Europe.

00:11:50.009 --> 00:11:52.178 align:middle line:84%
You know, the civilized
world going on right

00:11:52.178 --> 00:11:54.080 align:middle line:90%
now as we speak-- Spain, Italy.

00:11:54.080 --> 00:11:56.982 align:middle line:84%
Look at the guy in Italy,
the comedian who just won.

00:11:56.982 --> 00:11:59.218 align:middle line:84%
He's brilliant and he's
rallying the people.

00:11:59.218 --> 00:12:00.152 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:12:00.152 --> 00:12:01.921 align:middle line:84%
I was so hoping
that would happen.

00:12:01.921 --> 00:12:05.091 align:middle line:84%
He is rallying the people,
telling them to wake up.

00:12:05.091 --> 00:12:07.259 align:middle line:84%
>>HOFFMAN: You're seeing
it around the world.

00:12:07.259 --> 00:12:09.395 align:middle line:90%
You've seen it less here.

00:12:09.395 --> 00:12:12.331 align:middle line:84%
But generally
speaking, when you talk

00:12:12.331 --> 00:12:15.434 align:middle line:84%
about the levels of
poverty, the all-time levels

00:12:15.434 --> 00:12:17.670 align:middle line:90%
of homelessness, the JOBS Act.

00:12:17.670 --> 00:12:20.172 align:middle line:84%
I mean, we don't even have to
go into the job report itself,

00:12:20.172 --> 00:12:22.141 align:middle line:90%
but you are correct.

00:12:22.141 --> 00:12:24.410 align:middle line:84%
Even the jobs that they
report that are true

00:12:24.410 --> 00:12:29.882 align:middle line:84%
are either in the 16 to 24
age group or the 55 to 69

00:12:29.882 --> 00:12:30.716 align:middle line:90%
age group.

00:12:30.716 --> 00:12:31.851 align:middle line:90%
And they're all part-time jobs--

00:12:31.851 --> 00:12:32.685 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: That's like
greeter at Walmart jobs.

00:12:32.685 --> 00:12:33.219 align:middle line:90%
>>HOFFMAN: --with minimum wage.

00:12:33.219 --> 00:12:33.786 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:12:33.786 --> 00:12:35.087 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:12:35.087 --> 00:12:36.355 align:middle line:84%
>>HOFFMAN: So it's got to
the point where they're now

00:12:36.355 --> 00:12:38.858 align:middle line:84%
reporting 200,000 jobs,
except more than half of them

00:12:38.858 --> 00:12:39.959 align:middle line:90%
are part-time jobs.

00:12:39.959 --> 00:12:42.194 align:middle line:84%
So you can cut that
in half, and then you

00:12:42.194 --> 00:12:43.963 align:middle line:90%
have the minimum wage issue.

00:12:43.963 --> 00:12:45.331 align:middle line:84%
Which, by the way,
the government

00:12:45.331 --> 00:12:48.768 align:middle line:84%
wants to increase,
which would only

00:12:48.768 --> 00:12:51.237 align:middle line:84%
make things worse because
between that and Obamacare

00:12:51.237 --> 00:12:53.639 align:middle line:84%
and the higher payroll
taxes, small businesses have

00:12:53.639 --> 00:12:55.074 align:middle line:90%
no interest in lending anyway.

00:12:55.074 --> 00:12:57.910 align:middle line:84%
So they're just-- again,
government gets bigger.

00:12:57.910 --> 00:12:59.345 align:middle line:90%
They destroy business.

00:12:59.345 --> 00:13:03.315 align:middle line:84%
And you're talking about the
facade of the middle class.

00:13:03.315 --> 00:13:07.720 align:middle line:84%
The middle class is disappearing
mostly because of inflation.

00:13:07.720 --> 00:13:11.090 align:middle line:84%
When I was growing up,
my father worked one job

00:13:11.090 --> 00:13:12.458 align:middle line:90%
and supported a family.

00:13:12.458 --> 00:13:14.326 align:middle line:90%
Then, my mother had to work.

00:13:14.326 --> 00:13:16.629 align:middle line:84%
And then, we became--
we couldn't keep up

00:13:16.629 --> 00:13:17.997 align:middle line:84%
with the rest of
the neighborhood

00:13:17.997 --> 00:13:20.833 align:middle line:84%
because it just wasn't enough
in an inflationary environment.

00:13:20.833 --> 00:13:23.002 align:middle line:84%
So what's left of
the middle class

00:13:23.002 --> 00:13:24.470 align:middle line:84%
is not really
watching the markets.

00:13:24.470 --> 00:13:26.138 align:middle line:84%
You have record
low participation

00:13:26.138 --> 00:13:27.506 align:middle line:90%
in the equity markets.

00:13:27.506 --> 00:13:30.209 align:middle line:84%
As you said in the beginnings,
algorithms have taken over.

00:13:30.209 --> 00:13:33.879 align:middle line:84%
That's what's running
the markets these days.

00:13:33.879 --> 00:13:35.414 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: I mean
interestingly, there

00:13:35.414 --> 00:13:37.149 align:middle line:84%
seems to be a quirky
group of young people

00:13:37.149 --> 00:13:40.953 align:middle line:84%
that I just noticed recently
that are plugging into somehow,

00:13:40.953 --> 00:13:44.156 align:middle line:84%
just kind of figuring out
how this machine model works

00:13:44.156 --> 00:13:45.391 align:middle line:90%
in finance.

00:13:45.391 --> 00:13:48.227 align:middle line:84%
And knowing as a mathematical
model, they plug in

00:13:48.227 --> 00:13:49.428 align:middle line:90%
and then they unplug.

00:13:49.428 --> 00:13:53.065 align:middle line:84%
But the point is, that's
a very strange, quirky way

00:13:53.065 --> 00:13:54.834 align:middle line:90%
to start-- to do investing.

00:13:54.834 --> 00:13:58.204 align:middle line:84%
And it's not for most
people by any means.

00:13:58.204 --> 00:14:00.573 align:middle line:84%
>>HOFFMAN: Well, I call
people like that raptors.

00:14:00.573 --> 00:14:04.510 align:middle line:84%
It's a term that I got from
another mentor in the business.

00:14:04.510 --> 00:14:08.013 align:middle line:84%
Because look, the government
runs the markets now.

00:14:08.013 --> 00:14:09.281 align:middle line:90%
You don't need me to say that.

00:14:09.281 --> 00:14:10.549 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Explain that to us.

00:14:10.549 --> 00:14:13.452 align:middle line:84%
>>HOFFMAN: The Federal Reserve
has quantitative easing.

00:14:13.452 --> 00:14:16.021 align:middle line:84%
They buy all of the treasury
bonds that are issued.

00:14:16.021 --> 00:14:18.090 align:middle line:84%
In fact, through the first
two months of the year,

00:14:18.090 --> 00:14:20.659 align:middle line:84%
they bought more treasury
bonds than were issued.

00:14:20.659 --> 00:14:22.995 align:middle line:84%
That's how much they are
controlling the market.

00:14:22.995 --> 00:14:24.096 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:14:24.096 --> 00:14:25.331 align:middle line:84%
>>HOFFMAN: Then you
have the working group

00:14:25.331 --> 00:14:27.399 align:middle line:84%
on capital markets whose
job is to support the stock

00:14:27.399 --> 00:14:30.035 align:middle line:90%
market, which every day I prove.

00:14:30.035 --> 00:14:31.570 align:middle line:90%
I show the evidence of it.

00:14:31.570 --> 00:14:33.339 align:middle line:84%
You have the Exchange
Stabilization Fund

00:14:33.339 --> 00:14:36.375 align:middle line:84%
whose job is to
manipulate-- sorry, manage--

00:14:36.375 --> 00:14:39.411 align:middle line:84%
the currency and
even gold markets.

00:14:39.411 --> 00:14:41.780 align:middle line:84%
And then of course,
the secret gold cartel,

00:14:41.780 --> 00:14:43.215 align:middle line:90%
which is in there every day.

00:14:43.215 --> 00:14:47.786 align:middle line:84%
So they are in there
creating the patterns

00:14:47.786 --> 00:14:49.255 align:middle line:90%
of the market with algorithms.

00:14:49.255 --> 00:14:51.090 align:middle line:84%
And people like
you're talking about,

00:14:51.090 --> 00:14:54.126 align:middle line:84%
they are simply
piggybacking on top of it.

00:14:54.126 --> 00:14:55.094 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: That's right.

00:14:55.094 --> 00:14:56.462 align:middle line:84%
>>HOFFMAN: And I
write every day.

00:14:56.462 --> 00:14:57.463 align:middle line:90%
I show people-- look.

00:14:57.463 --> 00:14:58.864 align:middle line:84%
I go, look at the
market right here.

00:14:58.864 --> 00:15:00.165 align:middle line:90%
This is what it's going to do.

00:15:00.165 --> 00:15:02.101 align:middle line:84%
And I'm always right
because it's very simple.

00:15:02.101 --> 00:15:03.068 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: It's very predictable.

00:15:03.068 --> 00:15:04.270 align:middle line:84%
>>HOFFMAN: They do
the same things.

00:15:04.270 --> 00:15:05.471 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: It's the same
algorithms over and over.

00:15:05.471 --> 00:15:07.473 align:middle line:84%
>>HOFFMAN: Yeah, people
that are listeners

00:15:07.473 --> 00:15:11.243 align:middle line:84%
should Google "Dow Jones
Propaganda Average."

00:15:11.243 --> 00:15:13.279 align:middle line:90%
It's an article that I wrote.

00:15:13.279 --> 00:15:16.749 align:middle line:84%
And another one called
"Cartel Herald."

00:15:16.749 --> 00:15:18.417 align:middle line:84%
These articles are
about the patterns

00:15:18.417 --> 00:15:22.821 align:middle line:84%
that the Dow and the gold price
do nearly every single day.

00:15:22.821 --> 00:15:24.924 align:middle line:90%
I wrote it more than a year ago.

00:15:24.924 --> 00:15:26.759 align:middle line:84%
And still, today is
a perfect example.

00:15:26.759 --> 00:15:30.496 align:middle line:84%
Both are doing exactly what
they are programmed to do.

00:15:30.496 --> 00:15:32.231 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Well, let's
look at the market.

00:15:32.231 --> 00:15:35.367 align:middle line:84%
And if there is any kind
of purist sense left

00:15:35.367 --> 00:15:39.371 align:middle line:84%
in the market, is
there much trading

00:15:39.371 --> 00:15:42.141 align:middle line:84%
going on when it comes to
manufacturing and retail goods?

00:15:42.141 --> 00:15:44.610 align:middle line:84%
Or is it all just
financial instruments now?

00:15:44.610 --> 00:15:46.178 align:middle line:84%
>>HOFFMAN: It's
financial instruments.

00:15:46.178 --> 00:15:49.782 align:middle line:84%
We are in the market, as I
said, record low participation

00:15:49.782 --> 00:15:51.183 align:middle line:90%
from the public.

00:15:51.183 --> 00:15:53.385 align:middle line:84%
We're also at record
low trading volumes.

00:15:53.385 --> 00:15:54.753 align:middle line:90%
I mean, decades low.

00:15:54.753 --> 00:15:59.158 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And yet, here
we have 1440, 14,500.

00:15:59.158 --> 00:16:00.259 align:middle line:90%
>>HOFFMAN: Yeah.

00:16:00.259 --> 00:16:03.262 align:middle line:84%
And by the way, the
Dow-- there's something

00:16:03.262 --> 00:16:06.131 align:middle line:84%
called survivor bias meaning
they deleted four companies--

00:16:06.131 --> 00:16:09.368 align:middle line:84%
AIG, General Motors,
Citigroup, and Eastman Kodak--

00:16:09.368 --> 00:16:11.403 align:middle line:84%
because they were either
bankrupt or reorganized.

00:16:11.403 --> 00:16:13.706 align:middle line:84%
If you put them in,
the Dow is not up.

00:16:13.706 --> 00:16:15.541 align:middle line:84%
And then of course,
adjusting for inflation,

00:16:15.541 --> 00:16:19.478 align:middle line:84%
the Dow is down as much as
70% in the past 15 years.

00:16:19.478 --> 00:16:20.813 align:middle line:90%
But that's not what you hear.

00:16:20.813 --> 00:16:23.882 align:middle line:84%
But you're saying, is
the economy doing well?

00:16:23.882 --> 00:16:24.883 align:middle line:90%
I mean--

00:16:24.883 --> 00:16:25.918 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: I know,
people say, wait.

00:16:25.918 --> 00:16:27.353 align:middle line:90%
But the markets are up.

00:16:27.353 --> 00:16:28.520 align:middle line:90%
We're recovering.

00:16:28.520 --> 00:16:29.888 align:middle line:84%
>>HOFFMAN: Well,
that's the word.

00:16:29.888 --> 00:16:31.390 align:middle line:90%
I use that word all the time.

00:16:31.390 --> 00:16:32.691 align:middle line:90%
They love that word.

00:16:32.691 --> 00:16:35.260 align:middle line:84%
They want everything to be
seen as steadily recovering.

00:16:35.260 --> 00:16:37.329 align:middle line:84%
But the facts just
don't prove it out.

00:16:37.329 --> 00:16:40.699 align:middle line:84%
They put out these things called
diffusion indexes constantly,

00:16:40.699 --> 00:16:44.136 align:middle line:84%
every week, that say,
well, the economic index

00:16:44.136 --> 00:16:46.171 align:middle line:90%
went from 53 to 54.

00:16:46.171 --> 00:16:47.706 align:middle line:84%
But those numbers
are meaningless.

00:16:47.706 --> 00:16:49.241 align:middle line:84%
And they're often
not comparable.

00:16:49.241 --> 00:16:51.543 align:middle line:84%
And usually, the things
that make them rise

00:16:51.543 --> 00:16:53.312 align:middle line:84%
are things like
inventories going up,

00:16:53.312 --> 00:16:54.580 align:middle line:90%
which is not necessarily good.

00:16:54.580 --> 00:16:57.516 align:middle line:84%
Or prices paid, which
means inflation--

00:16:57.516 --> 00:16:58.851 align:middle line:90%
not necessarily good.

00:16:58.851 --> 00:17:02.388 align:middle line:84%
Just like increased part-time
minimum wage jobs going up

00:17:02.388 --> 00:17:03.522 align:middle line:90%
is not necessarily good.

00:17:03.522 --> 00:17:06.258 align:middle line:84%
But like you said, the
system, the mainstream

00:17:06.258 --> 00:17:07.793 align:middle line:90%
will say, yes, that's good.

00:17:07.793 --> 00:17:10.395 align:middle line:84%
And then when the government
is in there moving markets

00:17:10.395 --> 00:17:12.431 align:middle line:84%
as soon as they come out,
then everyone will say,

00:17:12.431 --> 00:17:14.566 align:middle line:84%
well, I guess that means
things are recovering.

00:17:14.566 --> 00:17:18.237 align:middle line:84%
When in real life, record
food stamps, record debt,

00:17:18.237 --> 00:17:22.240 align:middle line:84%
all these things are what the
average person are seeing.

00:17:22.240 --> 00:17:24.743 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: What is the
name of that index?

00:17:24.743 --> 00:17:26.577 align:middle line:84%
I should have thought
of it before we

00:17:26.577 --> 00:17:27.546 align:middle line:90%
started talking today.

00:17:27.546 --> 00:17:28.847 align:middle line:90%
I cannot remember the name.

00:17:28.847 --> 00:17:32.217 align:middle line:84%
It starts with a B. And
it tracks the movement

00:17:32.217 --> 00:17:34.520 align:middle line:84%
of goods being shipped
around the world.

00:17:34.520 --> 00:17:35.888 align:middle line:90%
>>HOFFMAN: The Baltic Dry Index.

00:17:35.888 --> 00:17:37.222 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes, Baltic Dry Index.

00:17:37.222 --> 00:17:38.791 align:middle line:84%
Can you talk a little
bit about that?

00:17:38.791 --> 00:17:41.660 align:middle line:84%
Because that's kind
of like another fellow

00:17:41.660 --> 00:17:44.830 align:middle line:84%
I interviewed who always goes
to the cement conferences,

00:17:44.830 --> 00:17:47.299 align:middle line:84%
the banking conferences,
and keeps his finger

00:17:47.299 --> 00:17:50.702 align:middle line:84%
on the pulse of the most
basic elements of life.

00:17:50.702 --> 00:17:51.904 align:middle line:90%
The Baltic Dry Index.

00:17:51.904 --> 00:17:52.938 align:middle line:90%
>>HOFFMAN: Yes.

00:17:52.938 --> 00:17:55.841 align:middle line:84%
It's a measure of
trade activity based

00:17:55.841 --> 00:17:57.910 align:middle line:90%
on volume and price of tankers.

00:17:57.910 --> 00:17:59.111 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:17:59.111 --> 00:18:00.045 align:middle line:84%
What's being moved around
the world, real goods.

00:18:00.045 --> 00:18:01.246 align:middle line:90%
>>HOFFMAN: Yeah.

00:18:01.246 --> 00:18:03.248 align:middle line:84%
And of course, there's
always mitigating factors,

00:18:03.248 --> 00:18:05.918 align:middle line:84%
such as if they built too
many at any given time,

00:18:05.918 --> 00:18:07.152 align:middle line:90%
or there's maintenance.

00:18:07.152 --> 00:18:09.121 align:middle line:84%
But generally speaking--
I haven't looked at it

00:18:09.121 --> 00:18:10.389 align:middle line:90%
in the last two or three weeks.

00:18:10.389 --> 00:18:12.458 align:middle line:84%
But when I looked at it
two, three weeks ago,

00:18:12.458 --> 00:18:14.960 align:middle line:90%
it was at a multi-year low.

00:18:14.960 --> 00:18:17.863 align:middle line:84%
Like, it was as low as it
was at the bottom in 2008.

00:18:17.863 --> 00:18:19.998 align:middle line:84%
That's where it was
two or three weeks ago.

00:18:19.998 --> 00:18:23.068 align:middle line:84%
So again, you look
at electricity demand

00:18:23.068 --> 00:18:23.869 align:middle line:90%
around the world.

00:18:23.869 --> 00:18:25.370 align:middle line:90%
You look at transportation.

00:18:25.370 --> 00:18:27.172 align:middle line:84%
Railroad traffic
in this country.

00:18:27.172 --> 00:18:28.474 align:middle line:90%
This country that's recovering.

00:18:28.474 --> 00:18:31.810 align:middle line:84%
Plummeting gasoline
consumption in this country.

00:18:31.810 --> 00:18:33.312 align:middle line:90%
Plummeting.

00:18:33.312 --> 00:18:36.115 align:middle line:84%
But we're recovering
according to the media.

00:18:36.115 --> 00:18:38.484 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Well, I have not
looked at the Baltic Dry Index

00:18:38.484 --> 00:18:39.985 align:middle line:90%
in probably two or three years.

00:18:39.985 --> 00:18:41.720 align:middle line:84%
And it was just
trickling through my mind

00:18:41.720 --> 00:18:43.255 align:middle line:84%
that I needed to
check back in on it.

00:18:43.255 --> 00:18:45.023 align:middle line:90%
So all-time lows on that.

00:18:45.023 --> 00:18:46.492 align:middle line:90%
Let's take just a quick peek.

00:18:46.492 --> 00:18:48.460 align:middle line:84%
And by the way, I did
write down the numbers

00:18:48.460 --> 00:18:49.862 align:middle line:90%
on the Federal Reserve.

00:18:49.862 --> 00:18:52.598 align:middle line:84%
And here it says
zones $1.7 trillion

00:18:52.598 --> 00:18:54.333 align:middle line:90%
in US treasury securities.

00:18:54.333 --> 00:18:58.470 align:middle line:84%
And it's buying at a pace
of $45 billion a month.

00:18:58.470 --> 00:19:00.806 align:middle line:90%
What does that actually mean?

00:19:00.806 --> 00:19:02.875 align:middle line:84%
>>HOFFMAN: Well, it's
actually-- the total balance

00:19:02.875 --> 00:19:04.810 align:middle line:84%
sheet of the Fed just
hit over $3 trillion

00:19:04.810 --> 00:19:08.147 align:middle line:84%
when you include the treasury
bonds and the mortgage

00:19:08.147 --> 00:19:09.481 align:middle line:90%
bonds, all those things.

00:19:09.481 --> 00:19:11.717 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: The Fed has nothing
to do with the government?

00:19:11.717 --> 00:19:13.085 align:middle line:84%
These are private
banking institutions.

00:19:13.085 --> 00:19:14.019 align:middle line:84%
>>HOFFMAN: It's a private
banking institution.

00:19:14.019 --> 00:19:14.953 align:middle line:90%
Although--

00:19:14.953 --> 00:19:16.288 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So what
does this mean?

00:19:16.288 --> 00:19:19.958 align:middle line:84%
>>HOFFMAN: Well, they are
basically owned by the banks.

00:19:19.958 --> 00:19:22.594 align:middle line:84%
And their job is to
protect the banks.

00:19:22.594 --> 00:19:25.964 align:middle line:84%
I mean, the banks lobbied
for them, JP Morgan himself

00:19:25.964 --> 00:19:28.300 align:middle line:84%
and the rest of
them back in 1913.

00:19:28.300 --> 00:19:34.339 align:middle line:84%
And they've created this dual
mandate of steady inflation--

00:19:34.339 --> 00:19:36.909 align:middle line:84%
low inflation and
high employment,

00:19:36.909 --> 00:19:38.310 align:middle line:90%
but we've had neither.

00:19:38.310 --> 00:19:40.245 align:middle line:90%
And their job is to print money.

00:19:40.245 --> 00:19:43.549 align:middle line:84%
And when they're
buying $40 billion

00:19:43.549 --> 00:19:46.151 align:middle line:84%
a month of treasuries and $45
billion a month of mortgages,

00:19:46.151 --> 00:19:49.254 align:middle line:84%
they're literally printing
money and buying toxic assets.

00:19:49.254 --> 00:19:53.292 align:middle line:84%
And it's funny because you see
bank stocks are higher now.

00:19:53.292 --> 00:19:55.861 align:middle line:84%
They've all soared-- Bank
of America, Citibank, all

00:19:55.861 --> 00:19:57.229 align:middle line:90%
these companies.

00:19:57.229 --> 00:20:00.699 align:middle line:84%
But the fact is back in 2009,
FASB, the Financial Accounting

00:20:00.699 --> 00:20:03.635 align:middle line:84%
Standard Board, was
strong-armed into changing

00:20:03.635 --> 00:20:05.704 align:middle line:84%
the rules of how you
account for assets.

00:20:05.704 --> 00:20:07.906 align:middle line:84%
And they were basically--
The banks said,

00:20:07.906 --> 00:20:10.609 align:middle line:84%
you could basically mark
to market however you want.

00:20:10.609 --> 00:20:14.112 align:middle line:84%
You could call all your
bad mortgage assets par

00:20:14.112 --> 00:20:15.180 align:middle line:90%
if you want.

00:20:15.180 --> 00:20:17.249 align:middle line:84%
Meanwhile, since
2009, everyone knows

00:20:17.249 --> 00:20:19.585 align:middle line:84%
the housing market has
dramatically declined.

00:20:19.585 --> 00:20:22.087 align:middle line:84%
And they've been
marking up every quarter

00:20:22.087 --> 00:20:25.524 align:middle line:84%
those assets to give
themself paper gains.

00:20:25.524 --> 00:20:28.594 align:middle line:84%
And they take the free money,
the zero interest rate money

00:20:28.594 --> 00:20:31.129 align:middle line:90%
and pay themself bonuses.

00:20:31.129 --> 00:20:31.964 align:middle line:90%
That's how it works.

00:20:31.964 --> 00:20:33.298 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: It's unconscionable.

00:20:33.298 --> 00:20:35.667 align:middle line:84%
And recently-- I know this
isn't your area of expertise,

00:20:35.667 --> 00:20:37.502 align:middle line:84%
but you may be able to
help me a little bit.

00:20:37.502 --> 00:20:40.138 align:middle line:84%
Because I do want to do another
piece specifically on this.

00:20:40.138 --> 00:20:43.275 align:middle line:84%
I just went through the
purchase of a house.

00:20:43.275 --> 00:20:46.345 align:middle line:84%
And what I had to go
through since the last time

00:20:46.345 --> 00:20:48.580 align:middle line:84%
I purchased a house, which
was probably 10 years ago.

00:20:48.580 --> 00:20:52.351 align:middle line:90%
So this is post-2008, obviously.

00:20:52.351 --> 00:20:53.619 align:middle line:90%
It was shocking.

00:20:53.619 --> 00:20:59.424 align:middle line:84%
The process to me was shocking,
enraging, humiliating,

00:20:59.424 --> 00:21:03.929 align:middle line:84%
unethical, borderline
illegal, some of the things

00:21:03.929 --> 00:21:05.230 align:middle line:90%
that we had to do.

00:21:05.230 --> 00:21:06.765 align:middle line:84%
But we're highly motivated
because it was my old house.

00:21:06.765 --> 00:21:08.100 align:middle line:90%
I was buying my old house back.

00:21:08.100 --> 00:21:09.501 align:middle line:90%
So I was emotionally motivated.

00:21:09.501 --> 00:21:11.670 align:middle line:84%
So we put up with it where
all the other people that

00:21:11.670 --> 00:21:14.139 align:middle line:84%
tried to buy the same
house and many millions

00:21:14.139 --> 00:21:16.241 align:middle line:84%
of other properties
walk away because

00:21:16.241 --> 00:21:17.809 align:middle line:84%
of what they're
putting us through.

00:21:17.809 --> 00:21:19.878 align:middle line:84%
And at the end of
the day, the house

00:21:19.878 --> 00:21:25.584 align:middle line:84%
on a private conventional loan
had to meet HUD standards.

00:21:25.584 --> 00:21:28.620 align:middle line:84%
And I hadn't heard
of that before.

00:21:28.620 --> 00:21:31.723 align:middle line:84%
And they went through every
single bit of our finances

00:21:31.723 --> 00:21:34.426 align:middle line:84%
right down to who wrote
you that check and why.

00:21:34.426 --> 00:21:35.160 align:middle line:90%
Is it a loan?

00:21:35.160 --> 00:21:36.495 align:middle line:90%
Is it a gift?

00:21:36.495 --> 00:21:39.231 align:middle line:84%
And on and on,
right down to making

00:21:39.231 --> 00:21:41.800 align:middle line:84%
us have to-- telling us
if you want the house,

00:21:41.800 --> 00:21:44.870 align:middle line:84%
you make the repairs on it
before we close the deal.

00:21:44.870 --> 00:21:45.837 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:21:45.837 --> 00:21:47.873 align:middle line:84%
And then they said,
and, by the way,

00:21:47.873 --> 00:21:50.876 align:middle line:84%
this will be sold off to Freddie
Mac in the next few months.

00:21:50.876 --> 00:21:53.145 align:middle line:84%
OK, this is a lot of
information to take

00:21:53.145 --> 00:21:56.081 align:middle line:84%
in when you can't see straight
anyway because you're so angry.

00:21:56.081 --> 00:21:57.649 align:middle line:90%
What's going on?

00:21:57.649 --> 00:21:59.651 align:middle line:84%
>>HOFFMAN: Well, your
experience is exactly what

00:21:59.651 --> 00:22:01.019 align:middle line:90%
I've heard from multiple people.

00:22:01.019 --> 00:22:03.622 align:middle line:84%
I mean, exact similar
cases from banks,

00:22:03.622 --> 00:22:05.290 align:middle line:84%
like Bank of
America, major banks.

00:22:05.290 --> 00:22:09.261 align:middle line:84%
And the fact is that
those banks are insolvent.

00:22:09.261 --> 00:22:10.595 align:middle line:90%
They don't have a lot of cash.

00:22:10.595 --> 00:22:12.464 align:middle line:84%
And that's why the
Fed has said, we

00:22:12.464 --> 00:22:18.370 align:middle line:84%
will be keeping interest rates
at 0 until at least mid-2015,

00:22:18.370 --> 00:22:20.005 align:middle line:84%
which will actually
mean forever.

00:22:20.005 --> 00:22:21.940 align:middle line:84%
Because the only
people that benefit

00:22:21.940 --> 00:22:24.343 align:middle line:84%
from that zero interest
rate is the banks.

00:22:24.343 --> 00:22:26.411 align:middle line:84%
That's who they are lending
that money to at zero.

00:22:26.411 --> 00:22:29.414 align:middle line:84%
They need the money because
they are not liquid.

00:22:29.414 --> 00:22:32.484 align:middle line:84%
So they are giving a hard time
to anyone who needs a loan.

00:22:32.484 --> 00:22:36.488 align:middle line:84%
That said, the government
has been expanding its role

00:22:36.488 --> 00:22:39.858 align:middle line:84%
in the mortgage
market by-- well,

00:22:39.858 --> 00:22:43.395 align:middle line:84%
between the robo-signing,
where they've

00:22:43.395 --> 00:22:46.798 align:middle line:84%
been allowing the banks
to fraudulently make

00:22:46.798 --> 00:22:48.433 align:middle line:90%
all these title changes.

00:22:48.433 --> 00:22:50.035 align:middle line:84%
And now what you have
in the government

00:22:50.035 --> 00:22:52.437 align:middle line:84%
market where they've been
expanding the federal home

00:22:52.437 --> 00:22:53.071 align:middle line:90%
board.

00:22:53.071 --> 00:22:53.939 align:middle line:90%
What is it called?

00:22:53.939 --> 00:22:55.540 align:middle line:90%
FHLB, or whatever.

00:22:55.540 --> 00:22:57.642 align:middle line:90%
The zero-down loan agency.

00:22:57.642 --> 00:23:00.078 align:middle line:84%
And now, Fannie
Mae and Freddie Mac

00:23:00.078 --> 00:23:03.115 align:middle line:84%
have been buying almost every
mortgage that gets bought.

00:23:03.115 --> 00:23:05.817 align:middle line:84%
So you're saying they're
trying to support--

00:23:05.817 --> 00:23:08.520 align:middle line:84%
they're starting to subsidize
the low end of the market

00:23:08.520 --> 00:23:10.188 align:middle line:90%
by giving out entitlements.

00:23:10.188 --> 00:23:12.624 align:middle line:84%
But the high end of the market
where you're trying to be,

00:23:12.624 --> 00:23:16.194 align:middle line:84%
the banks literally
have no money to lend.

00:23:16.194 --> 00:23:17.963 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So essentially,
these are all

00:23:17.963 --> 00:23:20.132 align:middle line:90%
government-backed mortgages?

00:23:20.132 --> 00:23:22.000 align:middle line:84%
If it doesn't go out
of the shoot that way,

00:23:22.000 --> 00:23:24.403 align:middle line:84%
they will soon
acquire that loan.

00:23:24.403 --> 00:23:26.004 align:middle line:84%
So the government
is going to end up

00:23:26.004 --> 00:23:27.406 align:middle line:90%
owning all of our home loans?

00:23:27.406 --> 00:23:29.674 align:middle line:84%
>>HOFFMAN: Yeah, the mortgage
finance companies were pretty

00:23:29.674 --> 00:23:31.009 align:middle line:90%
much destroyed in 2008 and '09.

00:23:31.009 --> 00:23:33.345 align:middle line:84%
And there's still a few
around, but it's not

00:23:33.345 --> 00:23:36.248 align:middle line:84%
like it used to be where
Joe's Mortgage Company would

00:23:36.248 --> 00:23:37.749 align:middle line:84%
buy a loan, sell
it to someone else,

00:23:37.749 --> 00:23:39.217 align:middle line:90%
and ultimately to Fannie Mae.

00:23:39.217 --> 00:23:41.119 align:middle line:84%
Now, everything is going
through to Fannie Mae

00:23:41.119 --> 00:23:42.721 align:middle line:84%
because no one else
wants the mortgages.

00:23:42.721 --> 00:23:45.023 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So what is the
implication of the government

00:23:45.023 --> 00:23:47.325 align:middle line:84%
owning most of the
people's home loans?

00:23:47.325 --> 00:23:49.428 align:middle line:84%
>>HOFFMAN: Well, they own
a lot of bad home loans,

00:23:49.428 --> 00:23:51.897 align:middle line:84%
just like the Fed owns a lot
of bad treasuries and mortgage

00:23:51.897 --> 00:23:52.731 align:middle line:90%
bonds.

00:23:52.731 --> 00:23:55.434 align:middle line:90%
It's called systemic insolvency.

00:23:55.434 --> 00:23:58.870 align:middle line:84%
And it's just a matter of when
people will lose confidence

00:23:58.870 --> 00:24:01.339 align:middle line:84%
in the paper money
that they're monetizing

00:24:01.339 --> 00:24:02.908 align:middle line:90%
to pay for these things.

00:24:02.908 --> 00:24:04.876 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: But what happens
if there's-- I mean,

00:24:04.876 --> 00:24:08.180 align:middle line:84%
I know this borders
into conspiracy theory.

00:24:08.180 --> 00:24:11.349 align:middle line:84%
What happens if there's some
sort of legislative change

00:24:11.349 --> 00:24:13.251 align:middle line:84%
of heart about private
property ownership

00:24:13.251 --> 00:24:15.320 align:middle line:84%
and the government is
owning all these mortgages?

00:24:15.320 --> 00:24:18.723 align:middle line:84%
I mean, what could, in
the worst scenario--

00:24:18.723 --> 00:24:20.992 align:middle line:84%
I was very upset to
learn that that's

00:24:20.992 --> 00:24:22.727 align:middle line:84%
who was going to be
taking over the loan.

00:24:22.727 --> 00:24:23.895 align:middle line:90%
Not that I'm a fan of banks.

00:24:23.895 --> 00:24:25.497 align:middle line:84%
>>HOFFMAN: But that's
the whole point.

00:24:25.497 --> 00:24:27.432 align:middle line:84%
We were just talking
about big government.

00:24:27.432 --> 00:24:29.501 align:middle line:84%
The government is
taking over everything.

00:24:29.501 --> 00:24:31.336 align:middle line:84%
This is what has
historically happened

00:24:31.336 --> 00:24:32.804 align:middle line:90%
in societies in decline.

00:24:32.804 --> 00:24:36.341 align:middle line:84%
When there's poverty, people
look to big government.

00:24:36.341 --> 00:24:38.577 align:middle line:84%
Actually, I just wrote a
piece the other day called,

00:24:38.577 --> 00:24:40.879 align:middle line:84%
"It's not the Economy,
Stupid," and I was talkinga

00:24:40.879 --> 00:24:45.050 align:middle line:84%
about-- I was referencing
back in 1992 when Clinton

00:24:45.050 --> 00:24:48.286 align:middle line:84%
was running, his
campaign slogan was,

00:24:48.286 --> 00:24:49.521 align:middle line:90%
"It's the economy, stupid."

00:24:49.521 --> 00:24:51.256 align:middle line:90%
Which meant, the economy's bad.

00:24:51.256 --> 00:24:53.558 align:middle line:84%
Vote out those guys,
and vote us in.

00:24:53.558 --> 00:24:55.727 align:middle line:84%
But it means something
completely different now

00:24:55.727 --> 00:24:59.097 align:middle line:84%
in an age where unemployment is
chronic, and debt is chronic,

00:24:59.097 --> 00:25:00.265 align:middle line:90%
and food stamps are chronic.

00:25:00.265 --> 00:25:02.868 align:middle line:84%
It means that things
are bad, so you

00:25:02.868 --> 00:25:06.137 align:middle line:84%
vote for whoever can give
you the most entitlements.

00:25:06.137 --> 00:25:10.942 align:middle line:84%
So basically, Obama has been
able to grow his government

00:25:10.942 --> 00:25:14.179 align:middle line:84%
exponentially because people
just want entitlements.

00:25:14.179 --> 00:25:16.681 align:middle line:84%
They don't care if
they lose their rights,

00:25:16.681 --> 00:25:20.418 align:middle line:84%
if we go to war, if they
give up their houses.

00:25:20.418 --> 00:25:23.655 align:middle line:84%
They don't care as long as
nanny government helps them out.

00:25:23.655 --> 00:25:26.191 align:middle line:84%
And actually, I wrote another
piece just a week or two ago

00:25:26.191 --> 00:25:28.627 align:middle line:84%
called "One-Party Fascism,"
where I said, look,

00:25:28.627 --> 00:25:32.264 align:middle line:84%
the Republican platform of being
the party of the rich no longer

00:25:32.264 --> 00:25:34.165 align:middle line:84%
works because there's
no more rich people.

00:25:34.165 --> 00:25:35.534 align:middle line:84%
And that's why
eventually they're

00:25:35.534 --> 00:25:40.438 align:middle line:84%
going to-- that's why they're
kowtowing to all these spending

00:25:40.438 --> 00:25:43.308 align:middle line:84%
increases, because they're not
going to get elected otherwise.

00:25:43.308 --> 00:25:44.809 align:middle line:84%
Eventually, we're
going to just have

00:25:44.809 --> 00:25:46.611 align:middle line:84%
one party and a
fascist government.

00:25:46.611 --> 00:25:47.913 align:middle line:90%
That's how it works.

00:25:47.913 --> 00:25:51.116 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Well, yeah.

00:25:51.116 --> 00:25:53.018 align:middle line:84%
Back to that
homeowner piece is, it

00:25:53.018 --> 00:25:56.054 align:middle line:84%
was very disheartening
on an emotional level

00:25:56.054 --> 00:25:58.590 align:middle line:84%
to see this is what
everybody's going through.

00:25:58.590 --> 00:26:01.826 align:middle line:84%
Down to the extent, I talked
to the manager of a bank

00:26:01.826 --> 00:26:04.429 align:middle line:84%
in California,
Merchants National,

00:26:04.429 --> 00:26:07.332 align:middle line:84%
which is rated as one of the top
10 safest banks in the world.

00:26:07.332 --> 00:26:08.333 align:middle line:90%
I mean, in the country.

00:26:08.333 --> 00:26:09.334 align:middle line:84%
>>HOFFMAN: For
whatever that's worth.

00:26:09.334 --> 00:26:10.435 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: For
whatever that's worth.

00:26:10.435 --> 00:26:12.904 align:middle line:84%
It's a three-generation
locally-owned bank.

00:26:12.904 --> 00:26:14.406 align:middle line:90%
It's still in the same building.

00:26:14.406 --> 00:26:16.675 align:middle line:90%
They never made a scummy loan.

00:26:16.675 --> 00:26:19.144 align:middle line:84%
So considering their
behavior was good,

00:26:19.144 --> 00:26:21.379 align:middle line:84%
they're considered
among the safest banks.

00:26:21.379 --> 00:26:23.448 align:middle line:84%
And I was talking to
the manager and I just

00:26:23.448 --> 00:26:25.584 align:middle line:84%
mentioned what we were
going through on this.

00:26:25.584 --> 00:26:28.253 align:middle line:84%
And he said, oh, I can tell you
stories all day long he said.

00:26:28.253 --> 00:26:32.190 align:middle line:84%
But he himself had just
gone through a refinance.

00:26:32.190 --> 00:26:33.792 align:middle line:84%
And they did the
same thing to him.

00:26:33.792 --> 00:26:34.759 align:middle line:90%
He's the bank manager--

00:26:34.759 --> 00:26:35.894 align:middle line:90%
>>HOFFMAN: At his own bank?

00:26:35.894 --> 00:26:36.494 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:26:36.494 --> 00:26:37.696 align:middle line:90%
Very conservative.

00:26:37.696 --> 00:26:40.732 align:middle line:84%
Well, whoever that
goes through to,

00:26:40.732 --> 00:26:43.168 align:middle line:90%
whoever the underwriter was.

00:26:43.168 --> 00:26:47.305 align:middle line:84%
He said, they even made me have
to explain a check from my son

00:26:47.305 --> 00:26:48.873 align:middle line:90%
to me.

00:26:48.873 --> 00:26:51.810 align:middle line:84%
And he said, it was just
horrible what he went through.

00:26:51.810 --> 00:26:55.981 align:middle line:84%
He said, worse is the government
sent in an audit team.

00:26:55.981 --> 00:26:59.117 align:middle line:84%
Now, what is the name of
the agency that audits bank?

00:26:59.117 --> 00:27:00.585 align:middle line:90%
>>HOFFMAN: The FDIC?

00:27:00.585 --> 00:27:01.519 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Is it FDIC?

00:27:01.519 --> 00:27:02.520 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:27:02.520 --> 00:27:03.955 align:middle line:84%
So they sent--
whoever the agency is.

00:27:03.955 --> 00:27:06.992 align:middle line:84%
They sent in a team of
puppies, 25-year-old interns,

00:27:06.992 --> 00:27:10.762 align:middle line:84%
to audit this bank,
which is highly respected

00:27:10.762 --> 00:27:12.030 align:middle line:90%
in that community.

00:27:12.030 --> 00:27:14.366 align:middle line:84%
And this guy's probably
in his mid-60s.

00:27:14.366 --> 00:27:18.069 align:middle line:84%
And they went through the books
and they said, why are you

00:27:18.069 --> 00:27:19.437 align:middle line:90%
making loans to these people?

00:27:19.437 --> 00:27:23.375 align:middle line:84%
Because they still make home
loans in the area-- regional.

00:27:23.375 --> 00:27:26.277 align:middle line:84%
And he said, did you look
at our profit and loss

00:27:26.277 --> 00:27:28.146 align:middle line:90%
over the last 20 years?

00:27:28.146 --> 00:27:30.081 align:middle line:90%
And yeah, we looked at it.

00:27:30.081 --> 00:27:31.850 align:middle line:84%
He said, did you see
any losses in there?

00:27:31.850 --> 00:27:33.652 align:middle line:90%
No, we didn't see any losses.

00:27:33.652 --> 00:27:36.321 align:middle line:84%
But you shouldn't be
making those loans.

00:27:36.321 --> 00:27:38.523 align:middle line:84%
Now, that's a directive
from the government

00:27:38.523 --> 00:27:41.726 align:middle line:84%
to a healthy, little bank trying
to be part of a community.

00:27:41.726 --> 00:27:43.628 align:middle line:84%
Do not make loans
to your people.

00:27:43.628 --> 00:27:45.530 align:middle line:84%
>>HOFFMAN: Well, banks
are not in the business

00:27:45.530 --> 00:27:46.598 align:middle line:90%
of making loans anymore.

00:27:46.598 --> 00:27:48.199 align:middle line:84%
They're in the
business of accepting

00:27:48.199 --> 00:27:52.337 align:middle line:84%
0% cash from the government
and investing it in bonds,

00:27:52.337 --> 00:27:55.206 align:middle line:84%
like government bonds, that
the government is monetizing.

00:27:55.206 --> 00:27:56.875 align:middle line:84%
And then some of them
are the lucky ones

00:27:56.875 --> 00:27:59.310 align:middle line:84%
on Wall Street who are privy
to the inside information

00:27:59.310 --> 00:28:03.381 align:middle line:84%
and have all their algorithms,
so they can rig the market.

00:28:03.381 --> 00:28:06.317 align:middle line:84%
Look, I was a stock
analyst for 15 years.

00:28:06.317 --> 00:28:08.653 align:middle line:84%
That business-- I
left it 10 years ago.

00:28:08.653 --> 00:28:09.888 align:middle line:90%
That business is long gone.

00:28:09.888 --> 00:28:12.857 align:middle line:84%
There's no more underwritings,
IPOs, all that stuff.

00:28:12.857 --> 00:28:14.659 align:middle line:90%
That business is dead.

00:28:14.659 --> 00:28:17.662 align:middle line:84%
In fact, Wall Street
with all its profits

00:28:17.662 --> 00:28:19.397 align:middle line:84%
has been laying off
people left and right.

00:28:19.397 --> 00:28:21.766 align:middle line:84%
And there's going to be
hundreds of thousands of more.

00:28:21.766 --> 00:28:24.335 align:middle line:84%
Their business now is to be a
partner with the government.

00:28:24.335 --> 00:28:29.441 align:middle line:84%
Take the government's money,
rig markets, do shady deals.

00:28:29.441 --> 00:28:32.911 align:middle line:84%
And the mainstream
business of lending

00:28:32.911 --> 00:28:36.614 align:middle line:84%
is dead because you have
a very poor population.

00:28:36.614 --> 00:28:39.417 align:middle line:84%
You have a very
bad housing market.

00:28:39.417 --> 00:28:42.654 align:middle line:84%
And the government is right
to tell them not to do loans.

00:28:42.654 --> 00:28:45.924 align:middle line:84%
At the same time, they're giving
out free loans or no money

00:28:45.924 --> 00:28:49.828 align:middle line:84%
down loans to the poorest people
so that they can get votes.

00:28:49.828 --> 00:28:51.463 align:middle line:84%
They can't have
poverty, remember?

00:28:51.463 --> 00:28:52.130 align:middle line:90%
It can't happen.

00:28:52.130 --> 00:28:53.231 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:28:53.231 --> 00:28:56.568 align:middle line:84%
Yeah, it's all extremely
disturbing to think

00:28:56.568 --> 00:29:00.839 align:middle line:84%
that everything's going into
the hands of the government.

00:29:00.839 --> 00:29:04.909 align:middle line:84%
OK, so let's move on to gas and
oil, because we-- like you say,

00:29:04.909 --> 00:29:08.246 align:middle line:84%
the demand is down,
the price is up.

00:29:08.246 --> 00:29:12.517 align:middle line:84%
Normally, you would think that
to essentially get people back

00:29:12.517 --> 00:29:14.252 align:middle line:84%
to guzzling a little
more heartily,

00:29:14.252 --> 00:29:16.020 align:middle line:84%
you would start
lowering the prices.

00:29:16.020 --> 00:29:18.590 align:middle line:90%
But that's not happening.

00:29:18.590 --> 00:29:24.062 align:middle line:84%
We have been conditioned now to
believe that $3.25 or $3.50 is

00:29:24.062 --> 00:29:25.363 align:middle line:90%
a good price for gasoline.

00:29:25.363 --> 00:29:27.999 align:middle line:84%
That conditioning has taken
the last, what, 10 years,

00:29:27.999 --> 00:29:29.200 align:middle line:90%
to really drill into our--

00:29:29.200 --> 00:29:31.169 align:middle line:84%
>>HOFFMAN: And that's in
Colorado, not California.

00:29:31.169 --> 00:29:33.304 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: California
is at $3.75, $3.80.

00:29:33.304 --> 00:29:35.774 align:middle line:84%
And so it's been
drilled in to us

00:29:35.774 --> 00:29:39.277 align:middle line:84%
to accept that as a
normal price for gasoline.

00:29:39.277 --> 00:29:40.879 align:middle line:84%
>>HOFFMAN: Well, the
prices of gasoline

00:29:40.879 --> 00:29:43.248 align:middle line:84%
are not determined by the
government, thankfully.

00:29:43.248 --> 00:29:46.785 align:middle line:84%
Although, they certainly try to
manipulate those markets, too.

00:29:46.785 --> 00:29:49.788 align:middle line:84%
But the fact is those markets
are too big to manipulate.

00:29:49.788 --> 00:29:52.991 align:middle line:84%
There's a scarcity of
oil around the world.

00:29:52.991 --> 00:29:55.894 align:middle line:84%
And again, I was an oil field
service analyst for 10 years,

00:29:55.894 --> 00:29:57.929 align:middle line:90%
so I know this business well.

00:29:57.929 --> 00:30:00.498 align:middle line:84%
All the low-hanging fruit has
been picked over the years,

00:30:00.498 --> 00:30:02.734 align:middle line:84%
so it's now very, very
dangerous and difficult--

00:30:02.734 --> 00:30:03.835 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: The fracking-- yeah.

00:30:03.835 --> 00:30:05.370 align:middle line:84%
>>HOFFMAN: --to get
oil out of the ground,

00:30:05.370 --> 00:30:07.205 align:middle line:90%
so the prices have surged.

00:30:07.205 --> 00:30:10.175 align:middle line:84%
The inflation of costs due
to the printing of money

00:30:10.175 --> 00:30:12.443 align:middle line:90%
have also caused inflation.

00:30:12.443 --> 00:30:15.313 align:middle line:84%
And then of course, you
have all the tensions

00:30:15.313 --> 00:30:18.917 align:middle line:84%
between the Arabs now and
us that we have provoked

00:30:18.917 --> 00:30:21.853 align:middle line:84%
by attacking Iraq,
Afghanistan, Pakistan.

00:30:21.853 --> 00:30:24.789 align:middle line:84%
Now we're going to go into
Iran at some point-- Syria.

00:30:24.789 --> 00:30:27.458 align:middle line:84%
So there's a lot of reasons why
prices are going to stay high.

00:30:27.458 --> 00:30:30.228 align:middle line:84%
And in fact, at this
point today in March,

00:30:30.228 --> 00:30:32.330 align:middle line:84%
this is the highest
gasoline prices have ever

00:30:32.330 --> 00:30:34.265 align:middle line:84%
been in this country
at this time of year.

00:30:34.265 --> 00:30:35.733 align:middle line:84%
Remember, we're
going to be heading

00:30:35.733 --> 00:30:37.535 align:middle line:84%
into the driving
season in a few months.

00:30:37.535 --> 00:30:40.338 align:middle line:84%
They're also at pretty much
record highs in Europe.

00:30:40.338 --> 00:30:42.707 align:middle line:84%
And in Japan, of course,
where they've just

00:30:42.707 --> 00:30:46.211 align:middle line:84%
devalued the yen by 25% percent,
prices are skyrocketing.

00:30:46.211 --> 00:30:48.880 align:middle line:90%
So get used to higher prices.

00:30:48.880 --> 00:30:51.049 align:middle line:84%
And potentially,
significantly higher prices.

00:30:51.049 --> 00:30:53.651 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Well, I mean, the good
news is it drives innovation.

00:30:53.651 --> 00:30:56.621 align:middle line:90%
People are not driving as much.

00:30:56.621 --> 00:30:58.356 align:middle line:84%
Necessity is the
mother of invention.

00:30:58.356 --> 00:31:00.225 align:middle line:84%
Nothing like an empty
wallet to help you

00:31:00.225 --> 00:31:02.227 align:middle line:84%
find another resource
to move around.

00:31:02.227 --> 00:31:03.695 align:middle line:90%
And that's not a bad thing.

00:31:03.695 --> 00:31:04.796 align:middle line:84%
>>HOFFMAN: But it doesn't
help an economy recover

00:31:04.796 --> 00:31:06.197 align:middle line:90%
when no one's driving around.

00:31:06.197 --> 00:31:07.298 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: It does not.

00:31:07.298 --> 00:31:08.633 align:middle line:90%
The unintended benefit.

00:31:08.633 --> 00:31:11.236 align:middle line:90%
Hugo Chavez died last week.

00:31:11.236 --> 00:31:14.639 align:middle line:84%
And now we're looking
at potential instability

00:31:14.639 --> 00:31:17.909 align:middle line:84%
in Venezuela while they
determine what kind of leader

00:31:17.909 --> 00:31:20.845 align:middle line:90%
they're going to elect.

00:31:20.845 --> 00:31:24.649 align:middle line:84%
And what do you anticipate
that doing in terms of the oil

00:31:24.649 --> 00:31:26.918 align:middle line:84%
markets, if anything,
at this time?

00:31:26.918 --> 00:31:28.353 align:middle line:90%
I know it's very unpredictable.

00:31:28.353 --> 00:31:30.321 align:middle line:84%
Eighth largest oil
producer in the world.

00:31:30.321 --> 00:31:31.556 align:middle line:90%
>>HOFFMAN: Right.

00:31:31.556 --> 00:31:33.625 align:middle line:84%
Well, look, I remember when
Chavez came into office.

00:31:33.625 --> 00:31:37.161 align:middle line:84%
I think it was around '99
because I was doing my oil

00:31:37.161 --> 00:31:38.796 align:middle line:90%
analyst stuff at the time.

00:31:38.796 --> 00:31:39.864 align:middle line:90%
And he came in.

00:31:39.864 --> 00:31:41.266 align:middle line:84%
The first thing he
did was he kicked out

00:31:41.266 --> 00:31:43.268 align:middle line:84%
most of the foreign
oil companies,

00:31:43.268 --> 00:31:45.503 align:middle line:90%
like Exxon, immediately.

00:31:45.503 --> 00:31:47.939 align:middle line:84%
Because he thought PDVSA,
the Venezuelan company,

00:31:47.939 --> 00:31:49.073 align:middle line:90%
could do it better.

00:31:49.073 --> 00:31:51.376 align:middle line:84%
Since then, production
has fallen off a cliff

00:31:51.376 --> 00:31:52.777 align:middle line:90%
and it's never come back.

00:31:52.777 --> 00:31:56.681 align:middle line:84%
So they really destroyed their
nation just from that one act

00:31:56.681 --> 00:31:57.949 align:middle line:90%
alone.

00:31:57.949 --> 00:32:00.184 align:middle line:84%
And I would say-- I was
talking about it the other day.

00:32:00.184 --> 00:32:04.088 align:middle line:84%
It's probably a tie between
Chavez and Vladimir Putin

00:32:04.088 --> 00:32:06.391 align:middle line:84%
as to who hates America
more than anyone on Earth.

00:32:06.391 --> 00:32:07.091 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: I know.

00:32:07.091 --> 00:32:08.059 align:middle line:90%
That is so true.

00:32:08.059 --> 00:32:10.662 align:middle line:84%
>>HOFFMAN: Maybe
Ahmadinejad in Iran.

00:32:10.662 --> 00:32:13.531 align:middle line:84%
So in one way you'd
say, OK, it's good

00:32:13.531 --> 00:32:18.036 align:middle line:84%
that he's going to pa-- that he
died because potentially, it's

00:32:18.036 --> 00:32:19.170 align:middle line:90%
got to get better.

00:32:19.170 --> 00:32:20.438 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: You're saying
from not a humanistic,

00:32:20.438 --> 00:32:21.439 align:middle line:84%
but from a political
point of view.

00:32:21.439 --> 00:32:22.674 align:middle line:90%
>>HOFFMAN: Yeah.

00:32:22.674 --> 00:32:24.175 align:middle line:84%
Because again, like you
said, they have a lot of oil

00:32:24.175 --> 00:32:26.311 align:middle line:84%
and they can cause
a lot of waves.

00:32:26.311 --> 00:32:27.912 align:middle line:84%
But as it turns out,
just when he died,

00:32:27.912 --> 00:32:31.316 align:middle line:84%
his vice president made some
comments which were shocking.

00:32:31.316 --> 00:32:32.417 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: What did he say?

00:32:32.417 --> 00:32:34.018 align:middle line:84%
>>HOFFMAN: I mean,
he basically accused

00:32:34.018 --> 00:32:36.454 align:middle line:84%
the United States
of poisoning Chavez.

00:32:36.454 --> 00:32:38.690 align:middle line:84%
He said that our policies
have destroyed the world.

00:32:38.690 --> 00:32:41.392 align:middle line:84%
So it looks like the guy
who's going to take over

00:32:41.392 --> 00:32:44.562 align:middle line:84%
is going to be
equally anti-American.

00:32:44.562 --> 00:32:46.397 align:middle line:84%
And like you said,
anything could happen.

00:32:46.397 --> 00:32:49.467 align:middle line:84%
In fact, they just devalued
the Venezuelan bolivar,

00:32:49.467 --> 00:32:52.503 align:middle line:84%
I think, three or four
weeks ago by 50% overnight,

00:32:52.503 --> 00:32:54.172 align:middle line:84%
which was their second
major devaluation

00:32:54.172 --> 00:32:55.840 align:middle line:90%
in the last few years.

00:32:55.840 --> 00:32:56.607 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Oh, wow.

00:32:56.607 --> 00:32:57.942 align:middle line:90%
They're hurting.

00:32:57.942 --> 00:33:01.179 align:middle line:84%
>>HOFFMAN: This is a nation
that's having big problems.

00:33:01.179 --> 00:33:03.147 align:middle line:84%
And they're very, very
close with the Russians

00:33:03.147 --> 00:33:04.549 align:middle line:90%
and the Chinese.

00:33:04.549 --> 00:33:09.287 align:middle line:84%
And they hate us, so it's hard
to tell how that will play out.

00:33:09.287 --> 00:33:10.488 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: OK.

00:33:10.488 --> 00:33:15.026 align:middle line:84%
Well, this kind of segues
into the metals market.

00:33:15.026 --> 00:33:16.494 align:middle line:84%
Something's just
kind of scratching

00:33:16.494 --> 00:33:19.063 align:middle line:84%
at the back of my memory
about Venezuela and the metals

00:33:19.063 --> 00:33:19.964 align:middle line:90%
market.

00:33:19.964 --> 00:33:21.632 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

00:33:21.632 --> 00:33:22.767 align:middle line:90%
I see you saying yes.

00:33:22.767 --> 00:33:24.035 align:middle line:90%
Can you inform us?

00:33:24.035 --> 00:33:26.070 align:middle line:84%
>>HOFFMAN: OK, well, it's
certainly a good point.

00:33:26.070 --> 00:33:30.475 align:middle line:84%
The point is all the
supposed central bank gold

00:33:30.475 --> 00:33:34.245 align:middle line:84%
reserves have always just
been sitting on paper.

00:33:34.245 --> 00:33:36.647 align:middle line:84%
The governments tell you,
just like they tell you

00:33:36.647 --> 00:33:40.018 align:middle line:84%
what employment numbers are or
what the value of the dollar

00:33:40.018 --> 00:33:40.685 align:middle line:90%
is.

00:33:40.685 --> 00:33:41.786 align:middle line:90%
They tell you, yeah.

00:33:41.786 --> 00:33:45.556 align:middle line:84%
The US says, we have
8,133 tons of gold,

00:33:45.556 --> 00:33:48.059 align:middle line:84%
even though there's so much
evidence that they don't.

00:33:48.059 --> 00:33:51.162 align:middle line:84%
And now that all
these fiat currencies

00:33:51.162 --> 00:33:53.498 align:middle line:84%
are starting to really be
devalued with these currency

00:33:53.498 --> 00:33:56.134 align:middle line:84%
wars, a lot of the nations
of the world are starting

00:33:56.134 --> 00:33:59.270 align:middle line:84%
to say, why do we have
our gold in other nations?

00:33:59.270 --> 00:34:00.805 align:middle line:90%
That just doesn't make sense.

00:34:00.805 --> 00:34:02.673 align:middle line:84%
And most of the
gold has been held

00:34:02.673 --> 00:34:06.444 align:middle line:84%
at the Federal Reserve in New
York or at the Bank of England

00:34:06.444 --> 00:34:09.347 align:middle line:84%
in London, the
two vipers' nests.

00:34:09.347 --> 00:34:11.949 align:middle line:84%
The two most untrustworthy
of all the central banks.

00:34:11.949 --> 00:34:14.018 align:middle line:84%
So what you've seen
in recent years

00:34:14.018 --> 00:34:15.653 align:middle line:84%
is a movement
where central banks

00:34:15.653 --> 00:34:17.554 align:middle line:84%
are starting to ask
for their gold back.

00:34:17.554 --> 00:34:18.322 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:34:18.322 --> 00:34:19.557 align:middle line:90%
I've been following that.

00:34:19.557 --> 00:34:20.992 align:middle line:84%
>>HOFFMAN: And Venezuela
was the first one to do it.

00:34:20.992 --> 00:34:21.925 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: That's right.

00:34:21.925 --> 00:34:23.094 align:middle line:84%
>>HOFFMAN: About
two years ago, it

00:34:23.094 --> 00:34:24.829 align:middle line:90%
was all at the Bank of England.

00:34:24.829 --> 00:34:27.165 align:middle line:84%
And they wanted to
be the first one

00:34:27.165 --> 00:34:28.599 align:middle line:84%
to sit down in the
musical chairs.

00:34:28.599 --> 00:34:30.101 align:middle line:90%
So they got all their gold back.

00:34:30.101 --> 00:34:33.237 align:middle line:84%
But now you're seeing widespread
nations asking for it,

00:34:33.237 --> 00:34:35.807 align:middle line:90%
having referendums about it.

00:34:35.807 --> 00:34:39.476 align:middle line:84%
The big one was, of course,
the German Bundesbank

00:34:39.476 --> 00:34:41.945 align:middle line:84%
just about two months ago
said they want their gold.

00:34:41.945 --> 00:34:43.548 align:middle line:84%
And the United States
said, all right.

00:34:43.548 --> 00:34:45.148 align:middle line:84%
We'll give you only
a little bit of it.

00:34:45.148 --> 00:34:47.185 align:middle line:84%
And it will take
seven years to do.

00:34:47.185 --> 00:34:48.820 align:middle line:84%
Even though,
theoretically, it probably

00:34:48.820 --> 00:34:51.021 align:middle line:84%
could take about
two or three weeks.

00:34:51.021 --> 00:34:54.025 align:middle line:84%
So it's pretty obvious
that the gold is not there.

00:34:54.025 --> 00:34:57.161 align:middle line:84%
And if it weren't a majorly
rigged market held down

00:34:57.161 --> 00:34:58.830 align:middle line:84%
in the paper market,
it probably would

00:34:58.830 --> 00:35:00.331 align:middle line:84%
have exploded on
that news alone.

00:35:00.331 --> 00:35:03.334 align:middle line:84%
But the fact is there's a Swiss
referendum that's probably

00:35:03.334 --> 00:35:05.002 align:middle line:84%
coming up in May
about the same thing.

00:35:05.002 --> 00:35:06.504 align:middle line:84%
They're talking about
it in the Netherlands,

00:35:06.504 --> 00:35:07.872 align:middle line:84%
in Austria, a
bunch of countries.

00:35:07.872 --> 00:35:10.341 align:middle line:84%
So don't be surprised
if these wars

00:35:10.341 --> 00:35:13.111 align:middle line:84%
for the little remaining
actual physical gold

00:35:13.111 --> 00:35:14.746 align:middle line:90%
heat up in the next few years.

00:35:14.746 --> 00:35:17.648 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Well, you have to
give Hugo Chavez a little credit

00:35:17.648 --> 00:35:18.950 align:middle line:90%
there.

00:35:18.950 --> 00:35:21.919 align:middle line:84%
Smart enough to understand
this is bad news out there.

00:35:21.919 --> 00:35:23.421 align:middle line:90%
Let's get our gold back.

00:35:23.421 --> 00:35:25.690 align:middle line:84%
Was he able to
repatriate the gold?

00:35:25.690 --> 00:35:27.091 align:middle line:90%
>>HOFFMAN: Yeah, he got it.

00:35:27.091 --> 00:35:29.494 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So he might be one of
the few countries who actually

00:35:29.494 --> 00:35:31.796 align:middle line:84%
was able to do it because he got
in before the others starting

00:35:31.796 --> 00:35:33.030 align:middle line:90%
demanding.

00:35:33.030 --> 00:35:34.365 align:middle line:84%
>>HOFFMAN: Well, the Germans
haven't gotten theirs.

00:35:34.365 --> 00:35:36.467 align:middle line:84%
They're going to get a tiny
bit of it over seven years.

00:35:36.467 --> 00:35:40.171 align:middle line:84%
And if the Swiss
demand theirs back,

00:35:40.171 --> 00:35:42.507 align:middle line:90%
that could be a big deal, too.

00:35:42.507 --> 00:35:43.908 align:middle line:90%
That could be--

00:35:43.908 --> 00:35:45.777 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Well, everyone assumes
it's in Swiss vaults, anyway.

00:35:45.777 --> 00:35:48.679 align:middle line:84%
>>HOFFMAN: No, some of it is
overseas, in London, New York.

00:35:48.679 --> 00:35:53.184 align:middle line:84%
A lot of this goes back to World
War II because, at that time,

00:35:53.184 --> 00:35:56.254 align:middle line:84%
a lot of countries were scared
that they would be taken over,

00:35:56.254 --> 00:36:00.992 align:middle line:84%
so they were happy to send their
gold to the then good ally,

00:36:00.992 --> 00:36:03.094 align:middle line:90%
United States, and trust them.

00:36:03.094 --> 00:36:05.263 align:middle line:84%
But now they don't
trust us anymore.

00:36:05.263 --> 00:36:07.698 align:middle line:84%
Especially after what we
just pulled with the Germans

00:36:07.698 --> 00:36:08.733 align:middle line:90%
with their gold.

00:36:08.733 --> 00:36:10.034 align:middle line:90%
So they want it back.

00:36:10.034 --> 00:36:13.004 align:middle line:84%
I mean, there's no worry
anymore that France

00:36:13.004 --> 00:36:14.605 align:middle line:84%
is going to be taken
over and someone's

00:36:14.605 --> 00:36:15.640 align:middle line:90%
going to take their gold.

00:36:15.640 --> 00:36:17.508 align:middle line:90%
So they'll want it back.

00:36:17.508 --> 00:36:23.080 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: This is indicating a
much, much deeper global kind

00:36:23.080 --> 00:36:26.284 align:middle line:84%
of agenda based on fear
that's really going on now.

00:36:26.284 --> 00:36:27.652 align:middle line:90%
>>HOFFMAN: Absolutely.

00:36:27.652 --> 00:36:32.590 align:middle line:84%
Again, we're sitting here in
Boulder, which is a good place.

00:36:32.590 --> 00:36:35.626 align:middle line:84%
But most of the world is not
having such good fortunes.

00:36:35.626 --> 00:36:37.528 align:middle line:90%
There is a lot of fear going on.

00:36:37.528 --> 00:36:39.030 align:middle line:90%
We talked about Italy right now.

00:36:39.030 --> 00:36:41.799 align:middle line:84%
The fact that this
guy was elected.

00:36:41.799 --> 00:36:44.068 align:middle line:84%
I mean, he's a major--
well, he wasn't elected.

00:36:44.068 --> 00:36:46.571 align:middle line:90%
He got 26% of the vote.

00:36:46.571 --> 00:36:49.774 align:middle line:84%
Berlusconi, who was just
sentenced to prison the day

00:36:49.774 --> 00:36:51.442 align:middle line:90%
after the election, got 29%.

00:36:51.442 --> 00:36:55.012 align:middle line:84%
And then another guy who
also does not want us dirty,

00:36:55.012 --> 00:36:55.646 align:middle line:90%
got 29%.

00:36:55.646 --> 00:36:56.848 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: It's OK.

00:36:56.848 --> 00:36:58.516 align:middle line:84%
I've been there during
Italian elections before.

00:36:58.516 --> 00:36:59.684 align:middle line:90%
Wow, what a circus.

00:36:59.684 --> 00:37:01.319 align:middle line:90%
A lot of emotions run hot.

00:37:01.319 --> 00:37:02.920 align:middle line:90%
I'm so glad this guy got in.

00:37:02.920 --> 00:37:04.155 align:middle line:90%
>>HOFFMAN: But there is fear.

00:37:04.155 --> 00:37:07.391 align:middle line:84%
I mean, the Italian
economy and debt situation

00:37:07.391 --> 00:37:09.627 align:middle line:84%
is the worst it's been
since the Mussolini eras.

00:37:09.627 --> 00:37:10.928 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:37:10.928 --> 00:37:12.997 align:middle line:84%
>>HOFFMAN: And the same goes
for the Spanish going back

00:37:12.997 --> 00:37:15.633 align:middle line:84%
to the Spanish Revolution
around the 1930s.

00:37:15.633 --> 00:37:17.034 align:middle line:90%
It's the same thing.

00:37:17.034 --> 00:37:19.437 align:middle line:84%
Greece doesn't
even-- I mean, Greece

00:37:19.437 --> 00:37:21.239 align:middle line:90%
is on the verge of annihilation.

00:37:21.239 --> 00:37:22.673 align:middle line:84%
They're going to
have a civil war

00:37:22.673 --> 00:37:24.709 align:middle line:84%
and they're going to
start killing people soon.

00:37:24.709 --> 00:37:26.677 align:middle line:90%
It's that bad over there.

00:37:26.677 --> 00:37:27.945 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Let's go to the East.

00:37:27.945 --> 00:37:28.779 align:middle line:90%
What about Japan?

00:37:28.779 --> 00:37:30.081 align:middle line:90%
You just mentioned a bit ago.

00:37:30.081 --> 00:37:33.517 align:middle line:84%
Did you say that the yen
was devalued by 20% or 25%?

00:37:33.517 --> 00:37:35.286 align:middle line:90%
>>HOFFMAN: 25% just in 4 months.

00:37:35.286 --> 00:37:35.886 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: 25%?

00:37:35.886 --> 00:37:36.854 align:middle line:90%
Oh my gosh.

00:37:36.854 --> 00:37:38.022 align:middle line:84%
>>HOFFMAN: The
thing with Japan is

00:37:38.022 --> 00:37:40.224 align:middle line:84%
they've got these horrible
demographics where

00:37:40.224 --> 00:37:42.760 align:middle line:84%
they have the oldest
population on Earth

00:37:42.760 --> 00:37:44.228 align:middle line:90%
of the civilized country.

00:37:44.228 --> 00:37:47.064 align:middle line:84%
Actually, I think
there's only one country

00:37:47.064 --> 00:37:49.934 align:middle line:84%
at all that has an
older population.

00:37:49.934 --> 00:37:52.036 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: They know how to
take care of themselves.

00:37:52.036 --> 00:37:53.904 align:middle line:90%
Okinawa always had that moniker.

00:37:53.904 --> 00:37:55.406 align:middle line:84%
>>HOFFMAN: Over the
years, they have

00:37:55.406 --> 00:37:59.143 align:middle line:84%
been able, with the wealth
in their prime saving years,

00:37:59.143 --> 00:38:00.278 align:middle line:90%
to save.

00:38:00.278 --> 00:38:02.013 align:middle line:84%
They buy the treasury
bonds of the government.

00:38:02.013 --> 00:38:04.815 align:middle line:84%
But now they're getting
old and their population

00:38:04.815 --> 00:38:05.716 align:middle line:90%
is starting to shrink.

00:38:05.716 --> 00:38:06.617 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Low birth rates.

00:38:06.617 --> 00:38:07.718 align:middle line:90%
>>HOFFMAN: Yeah.

00:38:07.718 --> 00:38:11.322 align:middle line:84%
So they can't prop up
the government bonds

00:38:11.322 --> 00:38:12.156 align:middle line:90%
with their savings.

00:38:12.156 --> 00:38:13.457 align:middle line:90%
They need their money now.

00:38:13.457 --> 00:38:16.627 align:middle line:84%
So the government has just
initiated their own rounds.

00:38:16.627 --> 00:38:18.829 align:middle line:90%
They're up to QE10 right now.

00:38:18.829 --> 00:38:20.364 align:middle line:90%
And none of them were working.

00:38:20.364 --> 00:38:24.535 align:middle line:84%
So they just elected a guy
named Shinzo Abe, who actually

00:38:24.535 --> 00:38:28.272 align:middle line:84%
was prime minister
in 2006 and 2007

00:38:28.272 --> 00:38:30.608 align:middle line:84%
under a platform of printing
money, which failed.

00:38:30.608 --> 00:38:33.978 align:middle line:84%
But they re-elected him now
because he said this time,

00:38:33.978 --> 00:38:35.613 align:middle line:84%
I'm really going
to break the yen.

00:38:35.613 --> 00:38:38.015 align:middle line:84%
I am going to devalue
it as hard as I can.

00:38:38.015 --> 00:38:40.318 align:middle line:84%
We need to get those
manufacturing jobs back

00:38:40.318 --> 00:38:43.487 align:middle line:84%
that have gone to China now,
if you could believe that.

00:38:43.487 --> 00:38:48.225 align:middle line:84%
And so he came in and they just
did this incredible inflation

00:38:48.225 --> 00:38:50.728 align:middle line:84%
targeting QE round,
which finally

00:38:50.728 --> 00:38:52.196 align:middle line:90%
succeeded in breaking the yen.

00:38:52.196 --> 00:38:56.400 align:middle line:84%
So the yen is down almost
25% since I think December.

00:38:56.400 --> 00:39:00.604 align:middle line:84%
Now, anyone who has the
slightest understanding

00:39:00.604 --> 00:39:04.442 align:middle line:84%
of Japan knows that they
constantly talk about deflation

00:39:04.442 --> 00:39:06.210 align:middle line:90%
there, like it's a big problem.

00:39:06.210 --> 00:39:09.180 align:middle line:84%
Because they had the biggest
stock bubble in history,

00:39:09.180 --> 00:39:10.581 align:middle line:90%
or close to it.

00:39:10.581 --> 00:39:15.219 align:middle line:84%
It popped in 1989, and the stock
market is still down 75%, 80%.

00:39:15.219 --> 00:39:16.754 align:middle line:90%
So they consider that deflation.

00:39:16.754 --> 00:39:18.689 align:middle line:84%
And the same goes for
their real estate market,

00:39:18.689 --> 00:39:20.791 align:middle line:90%
which collapsed simultaneously.

00:39:20.791 --> 00:39:23.361 align:middle line:84%
But the fact is those are
just financial assets.

00:39:23.361 --> 00:39:26.731 align:middle line:84%
Real assets in Japan-- I mean
sorry, real items of value

00:39:26.731 --> 00:39:27.865 align:middle line:90%
have soared.

00:39:27.865 --> 00:39:29.867 align:middle line:84%
Tokyo has been the most
expensive city on Earth

00:39:29.867 --> 00:39:31.402 align:middle line:90%
for the last six years.

00:39:31.402 --> 00:39:33.504 align:middle line:84%
Yet, they complain that
they have deflation.

00:39:33.504 --> 00:39:36.841 align:middle line:84%
And they just devalued
the currency by 25%.

00:39:36.841 --> 00:39:38.609 align:middle line:84%
I just read an article
yesterday that said

00:39:38.609 --> 00:39:41.479 align:middle line:84%
they are now mandatorily
raising energy prices

00:39:41.479 --> 00:39:44.782 align:middle line:84%
by 20% across the board
for these older people.

00:39:44.782 --> 00:39:46.384 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: It doesn't
like deflation.

00:39:46.384 --> 00:39:47.318 align:middle line:90%
>>HOFFMAN: Right.

00:39:47.318 --> 00:39:48.519 align:middle line:84%
But again, that's
the propaganda.

00:39:48.519 --> 00:39:50.688 align:middle line:84%
>>HOFFMAN: Yes, deflation
of the stock market

00:39:50.688 --> 00:39:52.757 align:middle line:84%
and the real estate
market, which

00:39:52.757 --> 00:39:55.359 align:middle line:84%
has no impact on the
average person's life.

00:39:55.359 --> 00:39:56.794 align:middle line:84%
But the average
person is impacted

00:39:56.794 --> 00:39:59.096 align:middle line:84%
by soaring food
prices, energy prices.

00:39:59.096 --> 00:40:00.865 align:middle line:84%
And don't forget
Fukushima, now that they

00:40:00.865 --> 00:40:02.266 align:middle line:84%
don't have their
nuclear business.

00:40:02.266 --> 00:40:04.969 align:middle line:84%
Their nuclear--
their energy costs

00:40:04.969 --> 00:40:06.370 align:middle line:84%
are really going
through the roof.

00:40:06.370 --> 00:40:08.205 align:middle line:84%
So as far as I'm
concerned, Japan

00:40:08.205 --> 00:40:09.840 align:middle line:84%
is now the land of
the setting sun.

00:40:09.840 --> 00:40:13.010 align:middle line:84%
It's a very sad commentary
on money printing

00:40:13.010 --> 00:40:13.978 align:middle line:90%
and demographics.

00:40:13.978 --> 00:40:15.880 align:middle line:84%
And of course, now
the Chinese are

00:40:15.880 --> 00:40:20.384 align:middle line:84%
starting to lick their
chops about taking a bigger

00:40:20.384 --> 00:40:22.553 align:middle line:90%
piece of what Japan once had.

00:40:22.553 --> 00:40:23.320 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:40:23.320 --> 00:40:24.455 align:middle line:90%
And it's been interesting.

00:40:24.455 --> 00:40:26.624 align:middle line:84%
I mean, just as you
were talking, in my mind

00:40:26.624 --> 00:40:28.692 align:middle line:84%
I was kind of seeing
the flow of goods

00:40:28.692 --> 00:40:30.995 align:middle line:90%
over the last several decades.

00:40:30.995 --> 00:40:33.831 align:middle line:84%
And after World War
II, made in Germany

00:40:33.831 --> 00:40:36.333 align:middle line:84%
was a big stamp on the
bottom of a product.

00:40:36.333 --> 00:40:38.669 align:middle line:84%
And you were talking about
really high-quality products.

00:40:38.669 --> 00:40:40.204 align:middle line:90%
And then, came made in Japan.

00:40:40.204 --> 00:40:41.272 align:middle line:90%
We thought, ugh.

00:40:41.272 --> 00:40:42.339 align:middle line:90%
It was made in Japan.

00:40:42.339 --> 00:40:43.607 align:middle line:90%
It's not made in the USA.

00:40:43.607 --> 00:40:45.910 align:middle line:84%
Well, as time went on, we
started seeing in contrast

00:40:45.910 --> 00:40:49.980 align:middle line:84%
to made in China, Japan's goods
were looking pretty darn good.

00:40:49.980 --> 00:40:51.749 align:middle line:84%
There was a quality
factor there.

00:40:51.749 --> 00:40:56.020 align:middle line:84%
And now it's made in
China that we're getting.

00:40:56.020 --> 00:40:59.657 align:middle line:84%
And looking at that, is
there a potential for Japan

00:40:59.657 --> 00:41:01.859 align:middle line:84%
to recover themselves going
back into manufacturing?

00:41:01.859 --> 00:41:02.460 align:middle line:90%
>>HOFFMAN: No.

00:41:02.460 --> 00:41:03.127 align:middle line:90%
Well, no.

00:41:03.127 --> 00:41:04.328 align:middle line:90%
They're still there.

00:41:04.328 --> 00:41:06.197 align:middle line:84%
It's not like they've
gone-- they're going away.

00:41:06.197 --> 00:41:07.531 align:middle line:90%
But the fact is they peaked.

00:41:07.531 --> 00:41:08.933 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: They peaked.

00:41:08.933 --> 00:41:11.068 align:middle line:84%
>>HOFFMAN: And there's no chance
that they'll get any stronger.

00:41:11.068 --> 00:41:13.971 align:middle line:84%
Actually, China's not even
the low-cost producer anymore.

00:41:13.971 --> 00:41:15.940 align:middle line:84%
There are other
Southeast Asian nations

00:41:15.940 --> 00:41:17.842 align:middle line:90%
that are taking jobs from China.

00:41:17.842 --> 00:41:18.776 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:41:18.776 --> 00:41:19.844 align:middle line:84%
>>HOFFMAN: But on
the scale, Japan

00:41:19.844 --> 00:41:22.346 align:middle line:84%
is way below-- way
above China, and they're

00:41:22.346 --> 00:41:23.447 align:middle line:90%
losing jobs dramatically.

00:41:23.447 --> 00:41:25.216 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Vietnam, I
assume, is one of them?

00:41:25.216 --> 00:41:26.584 align:middle line:90%
>>HOFFMAN: Yeah, Vietnam.

00:41:26.584 --> 00:41:28.519 align:middle line:84%
A couple of the others
of interest-- Singapore,

00:41:28.519 --> 00:41:29.587 align:middle line:90%
what they are.

00:41:29.587 --> 00:41:30.721 align:middle line:84%
But there's a lot
being produced there.

00:41:30.721 --> 00:41:32.056 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Made in Malaysia.

00:41:32.056 --> 00:41:34.258 align:middle line:84%
>>HOFFMAN: So the
manufacturing is never

00:41:34.258 --> 00:41:36.627 align:middle line:84%
going to come back to
the States or Japan.

00:41:36.627 --> 00:41:39.063 align:middle line:84%
One thing about Germany, though,
unlike the United States,

00:41:39.063 --> 00:41:41.532 align:middle line:84%
which all the
corporations lobbied back

00:41:41.532 --> 00:41:45.836 align:middle line:84%
in the '80s for the GATT
Treaty and the NAFTA Treaty

00:41:45.836 --> 00:41:47.805 align:middle line:84%
because they wanted to
have cheap outsourcing.

00:41:47.805 --> 00:41:49.206 align:middle line:90%
They didn't do that in Germany.

00:41:49.206 --> 00:41:53.477 align:middle line:84%
So Germany still has not lost
the manufacturing that we have.

00:41:53.477 --> 00:41:55.212 align:middle line:84%
They do have some
kind of protection

00:41:55.212 --> 00:41:57.414 align:middle line:84%
of industry,
rightfully or wrongly.

00:41:57.414 --> 00:41:59.016 align:middle line:90%
We've given up everything.

00:41:59.016 --> 00:42:02.486 align:middle line:84%
And now, natural course of
things has finished us off.

00:42:02.486 --> 00:42:04.355 align:middle line:90%
And the same goes with Japan.

00:42:04.355 --> 00:42:06.423 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: OK, now we
go-- I want to stay

00:42:06.423 --> 00:42:08.025 align:middle line:84%
for a little bit on
the metals markets

00:42:08.025 --> 00:42:10.828 align:middle line:84%
just as a reflection,
a lens to look through.

00:42:10.828 --> 00:42:12.096 align:middle line:90%
But we go to China and Russia.

00:42:12.096 --> 00:42:14.598 align:middle line:84%
And you were saying
earlier that we're not

00:42:14.598 --> 00:42:17.001 align:middle line:84%
in very good relationship
in the United States

00:42:17.001 --> 00:42:18.836 align:middle line:84%
with either of those
countries, both of whom

00:42:18.836 --> 00:42:23.007 align:middle line:84%
have been gathering--
I mean, accumulating

00:42:23.007 --> 00:42:24.875 align:middle line:90%
massive amounts of gold.

00:42:24.875 --> 00:42:25.910 align:middle line:90%
Physical gold, though.

00:42:25.910 --> 00:42:27.111 align:middle line:90%
>>HOFFMAN: Of course.

00:42:27.111 --> 00:42:28.846 align:middle line:84%
Yeah, the markets
that trade here,

00:42:28.846 --> 00:42:31.348 align:middle line:84%
which have these familiar
patterns, are just paper gold.

00:42:31.348 --> 00:42:33.551 align:middle line:90%
I work at Miles Franklin.

00:42:33.551 --> 00:42:35.286 align:middle line:84%
We're one of the
biggest bullion dealers.

00:42:35.286 --> 00:42:37.421 align:middle line:90%
So I see the physical demand.

00:42:37.421 --> 00:42:38.622 align:middle line:90%
And it's enormous.

00:42:38.622 --> 00:42:41.458 align:middle line:84%
In fact, the US Mint just
had-- it's shattered.

00:42:41.458 --> 00:42:43.761 align:middle line:84%
Not just beat, it shattered
its all-time record

00:42:43.761 --> 00:42:46.063 align:middle line:84%
for silver eagle
sales in January.

00:42:46.063 --> 00:42:47.965 align:middle line:84%
It also had its
strongest February ever.

00:42:47.965 --> 00:42:52.903 align:middle line:84%
And it started out with a big
sales number in early March.

00:42:52.903 --> 00:42:55.673 align:middle line:84%
So you're seeing it on the
retail side, lots of sales.

00:42:55.673 --> 00:42:58.909 align:middle line:84%
We had our best ever December
and our best ever January.

00:42:58.909 --> 00:43:00.945 align:middle line:84%
And as far as the
Chinese and Russians,

00:43:00.945 --> 00:43:03.581 align:middle line:84%
they are very vocal
about what they're doing.

00:43:03.581 --> 00:43:05.950 align:middle line:84%
The Russians, every month,
publish their increases

00:43:05.950 --> 00:43:07.151 align:middle line:90%
in gold.

00:43:07.151 --> 00:43:09.553 align:middle line:84%
The Chinese don't publish
their increases in gold,

00:43:09.553 --> 00:43:11.155 align:middle line:84%
but they show their
import numbers,

00:43:11.155 --> 00:43:12.590 align:middle line:90%
which doubled last year.

00:43:12.590 --> 00:43:15.960 align:middle line:84%
And it's just an
astronomic increase

00:43:15.960 --> 00:43:19.964 align:middle line:84%
of buying around the world other
than the Western banks, which

00:43:19.964 --> 00:43:22.299 align:middle line:84%
have been secretly
distorting it.

00:43:22.299 --> 00:43:25.669 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So is the renminbi
going to be backed by gold?

00:43:25.669 --> 00:43:27.938 align:middle line:84%
I mean, are the currencies
of these two nations going

00:43:27.938 --> 00:43:29.907 align:middle line:84%
to go back to a
gold-backed status?

00:43:29.907 --> 00:43:32.209 align:middle line:84%
>>HOFFMAN: Well,
ultimately, that's

00:43:32.209 --> 00:43:35.179 align:middle line:84%
how-- again, there were 599
fiat currencies in history.

00:43:35.179 --> 00:43:36.580 align:middle line:90%
Every one has failed.

00:43:36.580 --> 00:43:39.783 align:middle line:84%
And we're at the stage now where
all the current currencies are

00:43:39.783 --> 00:43:42.586 align:middle line:84%
fiat, and they're all in
their kind of terminal stages

00:43:42.586 --> 00:43:45.255 align:middle line:84%
with the debt increasing
parabolically and inflation

00:43:45.255 --> 00:43:47.424 align:middle line:84%
starting to take off
around the world.

00:43:47.424 --> 00:43:49.560 align:middle line:84%
Ultimately, the only
thing that has ever worked

00:43:49.560 --> 00:43:50.594 align:middle line:90%
has been a gold standard.

00:43:50.594 --> 00:43:52.229 align:middle line:90%
So it will happen.

00:43:52.229 --> 00:43:54.331 align:middle line:84%
And the countries that will
lead that gold standard

00:43:54.331 --> 00:43:56.300 align:middle line:84%
will be the ones that
have the most gold.

00:43:56.300 --> 00:43:58.402 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So we're talking
Russia and China first, right?

00:43:58.402 --> 00:43:59.770 align:middle line:90%
>>HOFFMAN: Well, China.

00:43:59.770 --> 00:44:01.372 align:middle line:84%
I mean, Russia doesn't even
compare to how much China has.

00:44:01.372 --> 00:44:02.206 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes, China.

00:44:02.206 --> 00:44:03.240 align:middle line:90%
I hear there's warehouses full.

00:44:03.240 --> 00:44:04.608 align:middle line:84%
>>HOFFMAN: Russia,
ironically, is

00:44:04.608 --> 00:44:06.343 align:middle line:84%
one of the wealthier
nations in the world

00:44:06.343 --> 00:44:07.878 align:middle line:84%
because it's all
resource-based, take

00:44:07.878 --> 00:44:09.046 align:middle line:90%
care of all this inflation.

00:44:09.046 --> 00:44:10.281 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Absolutely.

00:44:10.281 --> 00:44:12.082 align:middle line:84%
>>HOFFMAN: They've recovered
all that they lost back

00:44:12.082 --> 00:44:14.084 align:middle line:90%
in the Cold War days.

00:44:14.084 --> 00:44:15.085 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Good for them.

00:44:15.085 --> 00:44:15.886 align:middle line:90%
I mean, seriously.

00:44:15.886 --> 00:44:17.221 align:middle line:90%
>>HOFFMAN: Yeah.

00:44:17.221 --> 00:44:18.522 align:middle line:84%
I mean, Vladimir Putin is
certainly getting his revenge,

00:44:18.522 --> 00:44:20.257 align:middle line:84%
even though the
people don't enjoy it

00:44:20.257 --> 00:44:21.358 align:middle line:90%
as much as the top people.

00:44:21.358 --> 00:44:22.760 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Well,
that is true, too.

00:44:22.760 --> 00:44:26.964 align:middle line:84%
So the thought is,
ultimately, those-- I mean,

00:44:26.964 --> 00:44:29.366 align:middle line:84%
is there word China
is striving to become

00:44:29.366 --> 00:44:31.502 align:middle line:84%
a gold-backed currency
as a nation again?

00:44:31.502 --> 00:44:33.637 align:middle line:84%
>>HOFFMAN: Well, they don't
say what they're doing.

00:44:33.637 --> 00:44:35.572 align:middle line:84%
But they know gold
more than anyone.

00:44:35.572 --> 00:44:37.741 align:middle line:84%
They've been around
thousands of years.

00:44:37.741 --> 00:44:39.476 align:middle line:84%
They understand the
culture of gold.

00:44:39.476 --> 00:44:41.445 align:middle line:84%
They promote the
public owning it.

00:44:41.445 --> 00:44:43.747 align:middle line:84%
They've been buying it hand
over fist in the government.

00:44:43.747 --> 00:44:46.684 align:middle line:84%
And they know very well--
look, they have $3 trillion

00:44:46.684 --> 00:44:48.419 align:middle line:90%
of reserves, of currencies.

00:44:48.419 --> 00:44:49.787 align:middle line:90%
Most of them dollars.

00:44:49.787 --> 00:44:51.989 align:middle line:84%
And they know that they need
to get rid of as many of them

00:44:51.989 --> 00:44:54.324 align:middle line:84%
as they can before
they become worthless.

00:44:54.324 --> 00:44:57.328 align:middle line:84%
Once they realize that they
can't buy anything anymore,

00:44:57.328 --> 00:44:58.662 align:middle line:90%
then the system will change.

00:44:58.662 --> 00:45:00.097 align:middle line:90%
And could that happen this year?

00:45:00.097 --> 00:45:01.131 align:middle line:90%
Sure.

00:45:01.131 --> 00:45:02.433 align:middle line:84%
Could it happen in
two or three years?

00:45:02.433 --> 00:45:03.133 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:45:03.133 --> 00:45:03.901 align:middle line:90%
Is it going to take 10?

00:45:03.901 --> 00:45:05.102 align:middle line:90%
No.

00:45:05.102 --> 00:45:07.337 align:middle line:84%
It's really hard to tell
how things will play out.

00:45:07.337 --> 00:45:09.006 align:middle line:84%
It could be a
singular event that

00:45:09.006 --> 00:45:11.975 align:middle line:84%
causes fear, and panic,
and loss of confidence.

00:45:11.975 --> 00:45:14.845 align:middle line:84%
Or it could take
several years gradually.

00:45:14.845 --> 00:45:16.647 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So let's talk
about the disparity

00:45:16.647 --> 00:45:20.918 align:middle line:84%
between this huge demand
for physical metals

00:45:20.918 --> 00:45:24.722 align:middle line:84%
and then the suppression on
paper of those same assets.

00:45:24.722 --> 00:45:27.391 align:middle line:84%
>>HOFFMAN: Well, look, this
is what I'm an expert in.

00:45:27.391 --> 00:45:28.759 align:middle line:84%
There's probably
no more than two

00:45:28.759 --> 00:45:30.127 align:middle line:84%
or three people
in the world that

00:45:30.127 --> 00:45:31.528 align:middle line:90%
have done as much work on this.

00:45:31.528 --> 00:45:35.299 align:middle line:84%
And they're also well-known
people, too, in my field.

00:45:35.299 --> 00:45:37.968 align:middle line:84%
And it's pretty obvious
what's going on.

00:45:37.968 --> 00:45:39.837 align:middle line:84%
The physical demand
is what keeps them

00:45:39.837 --> 00:45:42.906 align:middle line:84%
from pushing the
price down further.

00:45:42.906 --> 00:45:45.509 align:middle line:84%
But let's face it, we
talked about the Dow

00:45:45.509 --> 00:45:46.543 align:middle line:90%
at all-time highs.

00:45:46.543 --> 00:45:49.546 align:middle line:84%
The Dow isn't near
its lows compared

00:45:49.546 --> 00:45:51.982 align:middle line:84%
to the price of
gold in real terms.

00:45:51.982 --> 00:45:55.619 align:middle line:84%
And gold itself, despite
all of the smashing,

00:45:55.619 --> 00:45:57.321 align:middle line:84%
has been up for
12 straight years.

00:45:57.321 --> 00:46:00.290 align:middle line:84%
Even with this big smash
last two or three months,

00:46:00.290 --> 00:46:01.625 align:middle line:90%
gold's down 3% this year.

00:46:01.625 --> 00:46:02.926 align:middle line:90%
It's really no big deal.

00:46:02.926 --> 00:46:04.561 align:middle line:84%
And if you look at
other currencies.

00:46:04.561 --> 00:46:07.531 align:middle line:84%
Because remember, it's not
just priced in dollars.

00:46:07.531 --> 00:46:11.468 align:middle line:84%
Yen-based gold is now
at its all-time high.

00:46:11.468 --> 00:46:14.271 align:middle line:84%
So it's not just this
little US-centric world

00:46:14.271 --> 00:46:16.440 align:middle line:84%
where we're the only people
with the only currency.

00:46:16.440 --> 00:46:17.674 align:middle line:90%
There's currencies everywhere.

00:46:17.674 --> 00:46:21.478 align:middle line:84%
The Indian rupee pretty
much collapsed last year.

00:46:21.478 --> 00:46:24.281 align:middle line:84%
And the rupee gold was
hitting all-time highs

00:46:24.281 --> 00:46:25.282 align:middle line:90%
until very recently.

00:46:25.282 --> 00:46:26.583 align:middle line:90%
It just eased off a bit.

00:46:26.583 --> 00:46:31.321 align:middle line:84%
So in real terms, gold
is still outperforming

00:46:31.321 --> 00:46:32.890 align:middle line:90%
almost all assets.

00:46:32.890 --> 00:46:35.726 align:middle line:84%
And people get lost
in it when they

00:46:35.726 --> 00:46:37.995 align:middle line:84%
watch the financial
markets, or they

00:46:37.995 --> 00:46:40.297 align:middle line:84%
think in terms of what I
call paper PM investments.

00:46:40.297 --> 00:46:41.899 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Yeah, it
makes them nervous.

00:46:41.899 --> 00:46:43.300 align:middle line:90%
>>HOFFMAN: Yeah.

00:46:43.300 --> 00:46:45.335 align:middle line:84%
But what I encourage people to
do, and what I do personally,

00:46:45.335 --> 00:46:48.672 align:middle line:84%
is I just own the
real physical stuff.

00:46:48.672 --> 00:46:50.274 align:middle line:84%
Because when it goes
up or down, it's

00:46:50.274 --> 00:46:52.009 align:middle line:84%
not like I'm going to
do anything with it.

00:46:52.009 --> 00:46:53.343 align:middle line:90%
It's my savings.

00:46:53.343 --> 00:46:55.646 align:middle line:84%
When you have money in the
bank, it's not like people go,

00:46:55.646 --> 00:47:00.050 align:middle line:84%
I'm worried that my
savings will fall in value.

00:47:00.050 --> 00:47:01.485 align:middle line:84%
You just think
that's my savings.

00:47:01.485 --> 00:47:04.521 align:middle line:84%
I think of my gold and
silver as my savings.

00:47:04.521 --> 00:47:07.825 align:middle line:84%
And so I don't get phased
by when it goes up and down.

00:47:07.825 --> 00:47:10.027 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So gold is a
little pricey to get into.

00:47:10.027 --> 00:47:13.263 align:middle line:84%
It's still around
$1,600 at this moment.

00:47:13.263 --> 00:47:14.431 align:middle line:90%
What about silver?

00:47:14.431 --> 00:47:16.200 align:middle line:84%
Because, I mean, the
prices on paper of silver

00:47:16.200 --> 00:47:17.334 align:middle line:90%
have been repressed.

00:47:17.334 --> 00:47:18.869 align:middle line:84%
And as you say, there
are record productions

00:47:18.869 --> 00:47:21.505 align:middle line:84%
in the silver eagles
in the United States.

00:47:21.505 --> 00:47:22.806 align:middle line:90%
>>HOFFMAN: Right, record sales.

00:47:22.806 --> 00:47:24.041 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:47:24.041 --> 00:47:26.009 align:middle line:84%
>>HOFFMAN: And well, silver
is far more undervalued

00:47:26.009 --> 00:47:27.411 align:middle line:90%
than even gold.

00:47:27.411 --> 00:47:31.148 align:middle line:84%
And they call it poor man's gold
because it's more affordable.

00:47:31.148 --> 00:47:34.852 align:middle line:84%
And the ratio now is about 54
to 1 of gold to silver price.

00:47:34.852 --> 00:47:37.788 align:middle line:84%
Whereas, historically it's
been-- it was 15 to 1, or so,

00:47:37.788 --> 00:47:39.223 align:middle line:90%
for centuries.

00:47:39.223 --> 00:47:41.058 align:middle line:84%
And actually, that
15 to 1 ratio is

00:47:41.058 --> 00:47:43.060 align:middle line:84%
based on the amount of
silver that came out

00:47:43.060 --> 00:47:44.661 align:middle line:90%
of the ground compared to gold.

00:47:44.661 --> 00:47:45.896 align:middle line:90%
16 ounces for every 1.

00:47:45.896 --> 00:47:47.097 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:47:47.097 --> 00:47:48.665 align:middle line:84%
>>HOFFMAN: Today, that
ratio is closer to 9 to 1

00:47:48.665 --> 00:47:51.001 align:middle line:84%
because silver is
depleting rapidly.

00:47:51.001 --> 00:47:54.438 align:middle line:84%
And unlike gold, which every
ounce that was ever mined

00:47:54.438 --> 00:47:55.472 align:middle line:90%
is still around.

00:47:55.472 --> 00:47:57.541 align:middle line:84%
Silver has just about
all been consumed

00:47:57.541 --> 00:47:59.877 align:middle line:84%
because it's also a
major industrial metal.

00:47:59.877 --> 00:48:02.446 align:middle line:84%
So there's literally no
more than a billion ounces

00:48:02.446 --> 00:48:03.680 align:middle line:90%
of silver above ground.

00:48:03.680 --> 00:48:06.383 align:middle line:84%
And most of it is in vaults,
like in people's houses,

00:48:06.383 --> 00:48:08.051 align:middle line:90%
that are not going anywhere.

00:48:08.051 --> 00:48:10.554 align:middle line:84%
So silver, to me, is
far more undervalued.

00:48:10.554 --> 00:48:13.523 align:middle line:84%
And it's also more practical
for the average person.

00:48:13.523 --> 00:48:17.594 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So how can
these all-time high sales

00:48:17.594 --> 00:48:21.999 align:middle line:84%
be maintained if we're at
a maximum point of what's

00:48:21.999 --> 00:48:23.133 align:middle line:90%
available?

00:48:23.133 --> 00:48:25.035 align:middle line:84%
>>HOFFMAN: Well,
that's the tight rope

00:48:25.035 --> 00:48:30.274 align:middle line:84%
that the manipulators have been
walking on for some time now.

00:48:30.274 --> 00:48:33.277 align:middle line:84%
Because every time the
price gets pushed too low,

00:48:33.277 --> 00:48:34.511 align:middle line:90%
demand explodes.

00:48:34.511 --> 00:48:37.481 align:middle line:84%
I mean, that's what happened
in January and February.

00:48:37.481 --> 00:48:39.950 align:middle line:84%
And if you remember
in 2008, when

00:48:39.950 --> 00:48:42.920 align:middle line:84%
we had this big global meltdown
and every asset on Earth

00:48:42.920 --> 00:48:44.288 align:middle line:90%
was plunging.

00:48:44.288 --> 00:48:47.491 align:middle line:84%
The cartel got gold and
silver to fall temporarily.

00:48:47.491 --> 00:48:50.360 align:middle line:84%
Well, the price of silver at
that time went from 21 to 8.

00:48:50.360 --> 00:48:52.062 align:middle line:90%
The paper price on your screen.

00:48:52.062 --> 00:48:53.830 align:middle line:84%
But in our world,
at Miles Franklin,

00:48:53.830 --> 00:48:56.833 align:middle line:84%
the price never fell
below $16 an ounce.

00:48:56.833 --> 00:48:59.036 align:middle line:84%
So they were telling
you, if you owned

00:48:59.036 --> 00:49:03.840 align:middle line:84%
these ETFs, like SLV, or mining
stocks, you just got destroyed.

00:49:03.840 --> 00:49:06.944 align:middle line:84%
But if you owned the real
stuff, the price barely moved.

00:49:06.944 --> 00:49:10.180 align:middle line:84%
And every mint in
the world sold out.

00:49:10.180 --> 00:49:12.950 align:middle line:84%
In fact, the US Mint had
a shortage for two weeks

00:49:12.950 --> 00:49:14.318 align:middle line:90%
this year.

00:49:14.318 --> 00:49:16.353 align:middle line:84%
They sold out and for two weeks
they couldn't sell anything.

00:49:16.353 --> 00:49:19.556 align:middle line:84%
So we're seeing more and
more of these shortages.

00:49:19.556 --> 00:49:22.359 align:middle line:84%
It's just a matter of time
before the games get played

00:49:22.359 --> 00:49:24.995 align:middle line:84%
too much, and there's
a surge of demand

00:49:24.995 --> 00:49:27.798 align:middle line:84%
and the manipulators get
blown out of the water.

00:49:27.798 --> 00:49:29.066 align:middle line:90%
I mean, it will happen.

00:49:29.066 --> 00:49:32.402 align:middle line:84%
We've gone from $4 to $50
over the years in silver.

00:49:32.402 --> 00:49:34.538 align:middle line:90%
It will break $50 again.

00:49:34.538 --> 00:49:36.673 align:middle line:84%
And at some point, it
will break $100 and $200.

00:49:36.673 --> 00:49:38.175 align:middle line:90%
It's just a matter of when.

00:49:38.175 --> 00:49:41.011 align:middle line:84%
We talked about the other
nations and their metals

00:49:41.011 --> 00:49:44.881 align:middle line:84%
holdings as a hedge
against what's going on,

00:49:44.881 --> 00:49:47.150 align:middle line:84%
the instability in the
world economically.

00:49:47.150 --> 00:49:48.719 align:middle line:84%
As you say, these
fiat currencies.

00:49:48.719 --> 00:49:53.457 align:middle line:84%
What is the US' storage position
in terms of gold and silver

00:49:53.457 --> 00:49:54.825 align:middle line:90%
right now?

00:49:54.825 --> 00:49:56.760 align:middle line:84%
>>HOFFMAN: Well, again, the
US government or the treasury

00:49:56.760 --> 00:50:01.832 align:middle line:84%
has claimed it's had 8,133
tons for 30, 40 years.

00:50:01.832 --> 00:50:03.533 align:middle line:84%
Which, by the way, is
only worth a couple

00:50:03.533 --> 00:50:04.534 align:middle line:90%
of hundred billion dollars.

00:50:04.534 --> 00:50:05.569 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:50:05.569 --> 00:50:06.436 align:middle line:84%
>>HOFFMAN: So for
anyone who says, oh,

00:50:06.436 --> 00:50:07.637 align:middle line:90%
we got plenty of gold.

00:50:07.637 --> 00:50:09.639 align:middle line:84%
It's just not worth that
much compared to the debt.

00:50:09.639 --> 00:50:12.175 align:middle line:84%
With that said, they
don't have that gold.

00:50:12.175 --> 00:50:13.510 align:middle line:90%
This is my world.

00:50:13.510 --> 00:50:14.911 align:middle line:84%
There's so much
evidence out there

00:50:14.911 --> 00:50:18.115 align:middle line:84%
that it's been leased,
swapped, sold secretly.

00:50:18.115 --> 00:50:20.150 align:middle line:84%
I mean, all you have to
do is look at the Germans

00:50:20.150 --> 00:50:22.319 align:middle line:84%
asking for their gold
and not getting it.

00:50:22.319 --> 00:50:25.722 align:middle line:84%
Or why there's been no audit at
Fort Knox, or the Denver Mint,

00:50:25.722 --> 00:50:29.326 align:middle line:84%
or West Point for
the past 60 years

00:50:29.326 --> 00:50:30.761 align:middle line:84%
to know that the
gold's not there.

00:50:30.761 --> 00:50:33.163 align:middle line:84%
And there's plenty of
admissions along the way that

00:50:33.163 --> 00:50:34.297 align:middle line:90%
are ignored by the media.

00:50:37.634 --> 00:50:39.503 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: We only have
about 10 minutes left,

00:50:39.503 --> 00:50:41.405 align:middle line:84%
and I want to get
to a few things.

00:50:41.405 --> 00:50:44.841 align:middle line:84%
Do you feel complete on the
subject of metals right now?

00:50:44.841 --> 00:50:46.076 align:middle line:90%
I could go on asking you more.

00:50:46.076 --> 00:50:48.712 align:middle line:84%
Is there anything else we
want to talk about there?

00:50:48.712 --> 00:50:49.746 align:middle line:90%
>>HOFFMAN: Sure.

00:50:49.746 --> 00:50:50.814 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Go ahead,
whatever you have

00:50:50.814 --> 00:50:51.681 align:middle line:84%
to say on that before
I get to the last.

00:50:51.681 --> 00:50:52.749 align:middle line:90%
>>HOFFMAN: Sure.

00:50:52.749 --> 00:50:53.850 align:middle line:84%
The thing that people
need to understand

00:50:53.850 --> 00:50:56.853 align:middle line:84%
is that when you are
buying gold and silver,

00:50:56.853 --> 00:50:59.256 align:middle line:90%
you are saving your money.

00:50:59.256 --> 00:51:00.257 align:middle line:90%
You are not investing.

00:51:00.257 --> 00:51:01.892 align:middle line:84%
And the government
wants you to believe

00:51:01.892 --> 00:51:04.494 align:middle line:84%
that it's some speculative,
risky investment.

00:51:04.494 --> 00:51:05.962 align:middle line:84%
But in fact, it's
been the only way

00:51:05.962 --> 00:51:07.697 align:middle line:84%
to protect your
purchasing power.

00:51:07.697 --> 00:51:11.134 align:middle line:84%
Not just for thousands of years,
but for this past 10 or 15

00:51:11.134 --> 00:51:14.571 align:middle line:84%
years since the economy peaked
at the turn of the century.

00:51:14.571 --> 00:51:17.641 align:middle line:84%
It will be the only way you can
protect your financial assets

00:51:17.641 --> 00:51:20.811 align:middle line:84%
in the coming inflation as
it gets worse, no matter

00:51:20.811 --> 00:51:23.046 align:middle line:90%
what the propaganda tells you.

00:51:23.046 --> 00:51:27.317 align:middle line:84%
And I urge people to avoid
the paper PM investments,

00:51:27.317 --> 00:51:30.420 align:middle line:84%
Precious Metal investments,
and only own the real thing.

00:51:30.420 --> 00:51:31.788 align:middle line:84%
And to just give
me a call if you

00:51:31.788 --> 00:51:33.356 align:middle line:90%
have any questions about it.

00:51:33.356 --> 00:51:34.558 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: OK.

00:51:34.558 --> 00:51:36.026 align:middle line:84%
All right, now what about
the defense industry?

00:51:36.026 --> 00:51:38.428 align:middle line:84%
I mean, because that's
a huge part in the US.

00:51:38.428 --> 00:51:41.031 align:middle line:84%
Well, most industrialized
nations, that's

00:51:41.031 --> 00:51:42.499 align:middle line:90%
a big part of the budget.

00:51:42.499 --> 00:51:45.936 align:middle line:84%
What's going on with the
defense industry, and budgets

00:51:45.936 --> 00:51:46.903 align:middle line:90%
and spending?

00:51:46.903 --> 00:51:48.438 align:middle line:84%
How's that impacting
the big picture?

00:51:48.438 --> 00:51:50.173 align:middle line:84%
>>HOFFMAN: Look, it's
all about lobbying.

00:51:50.173 --> 00:51:52.109 align:middle line:90%
The big lobbies own the country.

00:51:52.109 --> 00:51:55.045 align:middle line:84%
The biggest lobby is the
health care industry.

00:51:55.045 --> 00:51:57.447 align:middle line:90%
And we got Obamacare.

00:51:57.447 --> 00:52:00.283 align:middle line:84%
The other big one
is the financials.

00:52:00.283 --> 00:52:02.752 align:middle line:84%
And the financials, basically,
have all the key posts

00:52:02.752 --> 00:52:04.087 align:middle line:90%
in government.

00:52:04.087 --> 00:52:06.823 align:middle line:84%
And then, of course, is the
military industrial complex,

00:52:06.823 --> 00:52:08.925 align:middle line:84%
which gets all
the wars it wants.

00:52:08.925 --> 00:52:13.029 align:middle line:84%
It has both parties asking
for increases in spending.

00:52:13.029 --> 00:52:14.164 align:middle line:90%
I couldn't believe it.

00:52:14.164 --> 00:52:15.966 align:middle line:84%
I mean, I understand the
Republicans have always

00:52:15.966 --> 00:52:17.200 align:middle line:90%
been into that.

00:52:17.200 --> 00:52:20.070 align:middle line:84%
But Obama coming out before
the sequester saying,

00:52:20.070 --> 00:52:23.874 align:middle line:84%
if we have the sequester, we
won't have military readiness.

00:52:23.874 --> 00:52:26.176 align:middle line:84%
And I'm going, we
already spend more

00:52:26.176 --> 00:52:28.945 align:middle line:84%
than the next 20
countries combined.

00:52:28.945 --> 00:52:32.849 align:middle line:84%
And we're talking about like 1%
or 2% cut in military spending.

00:52:32.849 --> 00:52:35.152 align:middle line:84%
And he, Obama,
the head Democrat,

00:52:35.152 --> 00:52:36.953 align:middle line:90%
is saying that we can't do that.

00:52:36.953 --> 00:52:42.092 align:middle line:84%
So they have a firm grip, these
military industrial companies,

00:52:42.092 --> 00:52:45.395 align:middle line:90%
on the purse strings.

00:52:45.395 --> 00:52:48.698 align:middle line:84%
And it's only a matter of
time per the quote you started

00:52:48.698 --> 00:52:50.467 align:middle line:90%
with before the next war begins.

00:52:50.467 --> 00:52:51.401 align:middle line:90%
Will it be in Syria?

00:52:51.401 --> 00:52:52.669 align:middle line:90%
Will it be in Iran?

00:52:52.669 --> 00:52:53.837 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Well, they have
to defend their existence.

00:52:53.837 --> 00:52:55.172 align:middle line:90%
>>HOFFMAN: Who knows?

00:52:55.172 --> 00:52:56.506 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: You can't get a
budget if you don't have a war.

00:52:56.506 --> 00:52:58.842 align:middle line:84%
You have to keep picking wars
to justify your existence.

00:52:58.842 --> 00:53:02.345 align:middle line:84%
And as you say, for
those contractors.

00:53:02.345 --> 00:53:05.215 align:middle line:84%
>>HOFFMAN: I mean, Netanyahu,
he was quite for a while,

00:53:05.215 --> 00:53:07.918 align:middle line:84%
but it was because he was
running for re-election.

00:53:07.918 --> 00:53:11.721 align:middle line:84%
And now he's re-elected and
he's screaming louder than ever

00:53:11.721 --> 00:53:13.857 align:middle line:84%
at how not just we
need to stop Iran.

00:53:13.857 --> 00:53:16.693 align:middle line:84%
But we, the United States,
need to help him stop Iran.

00:53:16.693 --> 00:53:20.330 align:middle line:84%
So something unnerving is
going to happen over there,

00:53:20.330 --> 00:53:22.432 align:middle line:84%
particularly if oil
prices continue to climb.

00:53:22.432 --> 00:53:23.400 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:53:23.400 --> 00:53:24.868 align:middle line:84%
And people have been
having-- The eye

00:53:24.868 --> 00:53:26.770 align:middle line:84%
has been on that for
quite a long time.

00:53:26.770 --> 00:53:30.440 align:middle line:84%
And it is certainly becoming
more worrying by the minute.

00:53:30.440 --> 00:53:33.877 align:middle line:84%
Let me ask you about something
that you have on your site,

00:53:33.877 --> 00:53:36.446 align:middle line:84%
and I've seen a
bit of the trailer.

00:53:36.446 --> 00:53:38.114 align:middle line:90%
There's a movie coming out.

00:53:38.114 --> 00:53:40.116 align:middle line:90%
What is the name of that film?

00:53:40.116 --> 00:53:41.518 align:middle line:90%
We were talking off-camera.

00:53:41.518 --> 00:53:44.120 align:middle line:84%
You're going to try to sponsor
a showing of it here in Boulder.

00:53:44.120 --> 00:53:45.522 align:middle line:90%
But what is the nature of it?

00:53:45.522 --> 00:53:46.756 align:middle line:90%
Where is it going to appear?

00:53:46.756 --> 00:53:48.792 align:middle line:84%
And take a few minutes
to tell us about it.

00:53:48.792 --> 00:53:50.093 align:middle line:90%
>>HOFFMAN: Sure.

00:53:50.093 --> 00:53:53.496 align:middle line:84%
I mean, nothing appeals to
me more than youth asserting

00:53:53.496 --> 00:53:55.565 align:middle line:84%
themself of good
causes, especially

00:53:55.565 --> 00:53:59.636 align:middle line:84%
in this country today
where it's so misspent.

00:53:59.636 --> 00:54:02.672 align:middle line:84%
Partially because there's not a
lot of jobs out there, but also

00:54:02.672 --> 00:54:05.041 align:middle line:84%
because there's texting
and video games.

00:54:05.041 --> 00:54:08.178 align:middle line:84%
And I came across a group
of about three years ago

00:54:08.178 --> 00:54:11.548 align:middle line:84%
that decided-- I mean, the guy
who's running it is about 50,

00:54:11.548 --> 00:54:13.883 align:middle line:84%
but he has a whole team
of college-aged kids,

00:54:13.883 --> 00:54:15.752 align:middle line:90%
and 20s and 30-somethings.

00:54:15.752 --> 00:54:19.456 align:middle line:84%
And they've created this
full-length animated feature

00:54:19.456 --> 00:54:23.293 align:middle line:84%
called "Silver Circle," which
is kind of an action adventure

00:54:23.293 --> 00:54:27.197 align:middle line:84%
movie about rebels against the
Federal Reserve creating silver

00:54:27.197 --> 00:54:28.431 align:middle line:90%
to save the economies--

00:54:28.431 --> 00:54:29.299 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:54:29.299 --> 00:54:30.333 align:middle line:90%
I love it already.

00:54:30.333 --> 00:54:31.668 align:middle line:84%
>>HOFFMAN: --and get
sound money back.

00:54:31.668 --> 00:54:33.536 align:middle line:90%
Yeah, the trailer is on YouTube.

00:54:33.536 --> 00:54:35.705 align:middle line:84%
Anyway, it took them
three years and more

00:54:35.705 --> 00:54:37.941 align:middle line:84%
than a million and a
half of their own dollars

00:54:37.941 --> 00:54:41.611 align:middle line:84%
to get this movie made,
which is not an easy thing

00:54:41.611 --> 00:54:44.714 align:middle line:84%
to do in this inflationary
world with the mainstream hating

00:54:44.714 --> 00:54:45.548 align:middle line:90%
your topic.

00:54:45.548 --> 00:54:46.816 align:middle line:90%
And they finally got it done.

00:54:46.816 --> 00:54:49.719 align:middle line:84%
And it's going to be premiering
in New York on March 22.

00:54:49.719 --> 00:54:52.422 align:middle line:84%
Then, there will be a series
of showings around the country.

00:54:52.422 --> 00:54:55.492 align:middle line:84%
We're working hard to
get it into Colorado.

00:54:55.492 --> 00:54:58.261 align:middle line:84%
And if so, hopefully
there's some listeners here

00:54:58.261 --> 00:54:59.629 align:middle line:84%
and in other parts
of the country

00:54:59.629 --> 00:55:00.997 align:middle line:90%
that will go and see it.

00:55:00.997 --> 00:55:03.199 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: It's finished, so I
assume you've seen the film?

00:55:03.199 --> 00:55:03.900 align:middle line:90%
>>HOFFMAN: No.

00:55:03.900 --> 00:55:05.001 align:middle line:90%
I've seen the trailer.

00:55:05.001 --> 00:55:06.202 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Oh, you've
only seen the trailer.

00:55:06.202 --> 00:55:07.304 align:middle line:84%
>>HOFFMAN: It's premiering
on the 22nd of March.

00:55:07.304 --> 00:55:08.905 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: You don't
get an advanced copy?

00:55:08.905 --> 00:55:09.973 align:middle line:90%
>>HOFFMAN: No.

00:55:09.973 --> 00:55:11.241 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Oh, I'd be
very curious to see

00:55:11.241 --> 00:55:13.543 align:middle line:84%
what you think about it in
terms of its commentary.

00:55:13.543 --> 00:55:14.377 align:middle line:84%
>>HOFFMAN: Well, I
love the trailer.

00:55:14.377 --> 00:55:15.712 align:middle line:90%
Actually, I have the comic book.

00:55:15.712 --> 00:55:17.947 align:middle line:84%
I've seen a bit of
what it's about.

00:55:17.947 --> 00:55:19.649 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So are we
along for a fun ride?

00:55:19.649 --> 00:55:21.151 align:middle line:84%
And do you think
that it's poignant?

00:55:21.151 --> 00:55:22.285 align:middle line:90%
>>HOFFMAN: Absolutely.

00:55:22.285 --> 00:55:24.621 align:middle line:84%
I think it's as relevant
as anything out there.

00:55:24.621 --> 00:55:27.324 align:middle line:84%
And more importantly,
it's done by youth.

00:55:27.324 --> 00:55:31.561 align:middle line:84%
It's young people that
believe in a good cause

00:55:31.561 --> 00:55:34.197 align:middle line:84%
and have put blood, sweat,
and tears into this film.

00:55:34.197 --> 00:55:35.699 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Speaking
of which, we only

00:55:35.699 --> 00:55:38.635 align:middle line:90%
have a couple minutes left.

00:55:38.635 --> 00:55:41.671 align:middle line:84%
What would you have
to say to the people

00:55:41.671 --> 00:55:45.008 align:middle line:84%
under-- essentially,
the under 30s?

00:55:45.008 --> 00:55:48.445 align:middle line:84%
People in their 20s graduating
from college, student debt.

00:55:48.445 --> 00:55:49.579 align:middle line:90%
>>HOFFMAN: The Millennials.

00:55:49.579 --> 00:55:50.814 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: The Millennials.

00:55:50.814 --> 00:55:52.949 align:middle line:84%
>>HOFFMAN: Or as a guy I
read named Gerald Celente--

00:55:52.949 --> 00:55:54.050 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes, I like him.

00:55:54.050 --> 00:55:56.252 align:middle line:84%
>>HOFFMAN: He calls
them Generation F'd.

00:55:56.252 --> 00:55:58.955 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah, F'd.

00:55:58.955 --> 00:56:00.757 align:middle line:84%
>>HOFFMAN: I mean, not
to make light of it,

00:56:00.757 --> 00:56:04.294 align:middle line:84%
but it's an extremely
difficult situation.

00:56:04.294 --> 00:56:05.762 align:middle line:90%
I do podcasts all the time.

00:56:05.762 --> 00:56:07.330 align:middle line:84%
I probably do three
or four a week.

00:56:07.330 --> 00:56:10.066 align:middle line:84%
And I'm starting to do a
bunch with young people.

00:56:10.066 --> 00:56:11.234 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Oh, good.

00:56:11.234 --> 00:56:12.936 align:middle line:84%
>>HOFFMAN: One is 16
years old, a bunch of them

00:56:12.936 --> 00:56:15.038 align:middle line:84%
are college kids,
very smart that

00:56:15.038 --> 00:56:16.706 align:middle line:84%
are really into
the topics today.

00:56:16.706 --> 00:56:17.707 align:middle line:90%
And they're worried.

00:56:17.707 --> 00:56:18.808 align:middle line:90%
They're fearful.

00:56:18.808 --> 00:56:20.543 align:middle line:84%
They live with their
parents, most of them.

00:56:20.543 --> 00:56:22.746 align:middle line:84%
They are not sure what
the future is going to be.

00:56:26.216 --> 00:56:27.951 align:middle line:84%
The only advice I could
give is the advice

00:56:27.951 --> 00:56:30.754 align:middle line:84%
I would have given to myself
back then, is to just work hard

00:56:30.754 --> 00:56:32.022 align:middle line:90%
and be focused.

00:56:32.022 --> 00:56:34.591 align:middle line:84%
And just, you have
to have optimism

00:56:34.591 --> 00:56:36.826 align:middle line:84%
because there's a lot
of good in the world.

00:56:36.826 --> 00:56:37.327 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Absolutely.

00:56:37.327 --> 00:56:38.495 align:middle line:90%
There is.

00:56:38.495 --> 00:56:40.196 align:middle line:84%
I mean, the world is
still, on so many levels,

00:56:40.196 --> 00:56:40.997 align:middle line:90%
a beautiful place.

00:56:40.997 --> 00:56:42.198 align:middle line:90%
We all still have each other.

00:56:42.198 --> 00:56:44.200 align:middle line:84%
We all still--
ideally, if we can

00:56:44.200 --> 00:56:47.337 align:middle line:84%
take a little responsibility,
have good food available to us

00:56:47.337 --> 00:56:47.837 align:middle line:90%
even.

00:56:50.340 --> 00:56:52.575 align:middle line:84%
Going back to these
kids, there are

00:56:52.575 --> 00:56:55.111 align:middle line:84%
some going into this kind
of micro-growing movement.

00:56:55.111 --> 00:56:57.080 align:middle line:84%
Agriculture is
becoming appealing

00:56:57.080 --> 00:57:00.016 align:middle line:90%
to some of the younger people.

00:57:00.016 --> 00:57:03.186 align:middle line:84%
I was wondering if
you had found any kind

00:57:03.186 --> 00:57:06.122 align:middle line:84%
of ingenious
breakthroughs among them

00:57:06.122 --> 00:57:08.191 align:middle line:84%
as a result of your
podcast and dealing

00:57:08.191 --> 00:57:12.061 align:middle line:84%
with them that are
inspirational for us?

00:57:12.061 --> 00:57:13.430 align:middle line:84%
>>HOFFMAN: Well,
I mean, it's not

00:57:13.430 --> 00:57:15.799 align:middle line:84%
like I'm following up
with them all the time.

00:57:15.799 --> 00:57:19.269 align:middle line:84%
They're slogging away
and I'm encouraged

00:57:19.269 --> 00:57:24.607 align:middle line:84%
by their optimism for
what they're doing.

00:57:24.607 --> 00:57:26.876 align:middle line:84%
But they're going to
have to dig-in hard

00:57:26.876 --> 00:57:29.446 align:middle line:84%
because it's not going
to be easy times.

00:57:29.446 --> 00:57:31.714 align:middle line:84%
Like I said, the
middle class has

00:57:31.714 --> 00:57:33.817 align:middle line:90%
been destroyed by inflation.

00:57:33.817 --> 00:57:36.486 align:middle line:84%
And it certainly is not going to
help the younger generation who

00:57:36.486 --> 00:57:38.121 align:middle line:90%
don't have much to start with.

00:57:38.121 --> 00:57:40.857 align:middle line:84%
But there are
opportunities out there.

00:57:40.857 --> 00:57:42.525 align:middle line:84%
I mean, I had to
remake myself twice.

00:57:42.525 --> 00:57:43.726 align:middle line:90%
I started out on Wall Street.

00:57:43.726 --> 00:57:45.094 align:middle line:90%
I went into mining.

00:57:45.094 --> 00:57:47.797 align:middle line:84%
All these businesses have been
hurt by government policies.

00:57:47.797 --> 00:57:48.965 align:middle line:90%
You can reinvent yourself.

00:57:48.965 --> 00:57:50.333 align:middle line:90%
There are good things.

00:57:50.333 --> 00:57:52.402 align:middle line:84%
There are things that are
expanding in the future.

00:57:52.402 --> 00:57:54.003 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And it seems to
me one of the things that's

00:57:54.003 --> 00:57:56.506 align:middle line:84%
coming up for them-- as you
say, a lot of them live at home.

00:57:56.506 --> 00:57:58.808 align:middle line:84%
And I see it as
another silver lining,

00:57:58.808 --> 00:58:01.811 align:middle line:84%
is the notion of
communal living again.

00:58:01.811 --> 00:58:03.813 align:middle line:84%
A lot of those kids
seem to be piling in.

00:58:03.813 --> 00:58:05.882 align:middle line:84%
I mean, we all did when we're
in our teens and early 20s.

00:58:05.882 --> 00:58:07.917 align:middle line:84%
But for longer periods of
time, even with children.

00:58:07.917 --> 00:58:08.718 align:middle line:84%
>>HOFFMAN: Well,
out of necessity.

00:58:08.718 --> 00:58:09.719 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Out of necessity.

00:58:09.719 --> 00:58:10.553 align:middle line:84%
>>HOFFMAN: Out of
necessity, people

00:58:10.553 --> 00:58:11.921 align:middle line:90%
will make the best of things.

00:58:11.921 --> 00:58:12.956 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So that means they
get to have company and someone

00:58:12.956 --> 00:58:14.023 align:middle line:90%
to dine with again.

00:58:14.023 --> 00:58:16.226 align:middle line:84%
I think that's a
delightful turn of events.

00:58:16.226 --> 00:58:17.794 align:middle line:84%
And Andy, I want to
thank you so much.

00:58:17.794 --> 00:58:19.729 align:middle line:90%
You're absolutely brilliant.

00:58:19.729 --> 00:58:22.832 align:middle line:84%
I mean, I learned so much in
my conversations with you.

00:58:22.832 --> 00:58:24.767 align:middle line:84%
Every single time I think
we've hit something,

00:58:24.767 --> 00:58:26.636 align:middle line:84%
you always go into it a
little deeper the next time.

00:58:26.636 --> 00:58:27.871 align:middle line:90%
So I just want to thank you.

00:58:27.871 --> 00:58:28.838 align:middle line:84%
And I'll look
forward to speaking

00:58:28.838 --> 00:58:30.006 align:middle line:90%
with you again in a few months.

00:58:30.006 --> 00:58:30.940 align:middle line:90%
>>HOFFMAN: Absolutely.

00:58:30.940 --> 00:58:31.641 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Does
that work for you?

00:58:31.641 --> 00:58:32.809 align:middle line:90%
Good.

00:58:32.809 --> 00:58:34.177 align:middle line:84%
I hope this has been
helpful to all of you who

00:58:34.177 --> 00:58:35.645 align:middle line:84%
need an interpreter
when attempting

00:58:35.645 --> 00:58:37.247 align:middle line:90%
to read the financial pages.

00:58:37.247 --> 00:58:38.915 align:middle line:84%
Andy'll be coming
back regularly to help

00:58:38.915 --> 00:58:40.850 align:middle line:84%
keep some reality
to the subject.

00:58:40.850 --> 00:58:44.854 align:middle line:84%
Until next time, thank you for
joining us here on Gaiam TV.

00:58:44.854 --> 00:58:46.389 align:middle line:90%
