>>REGINA MEREDITH:
I love the fact

00:00:09.590 --> 00:00:11.090 align:middle line:84%
that you're writing
about Manly P. Hall.

00:00:11.090 --> 00:00:13.160 align:middle line:84%
I love that you're writing
about "The Secret Teachings

00:00:13.160 --> 00:00:13.970 align:middle line:90%
of All Ages."

>>MITCH HOROWITZ: One of the
mysteries of the 20th century

00:00:17.210 --> 00:00:20.390 align:middle line:10%
study of the occult
and esotericism-- how

00:00:20.390 --> 00:00:24.380 align:middle line:10%
a 27-year-old man with
no formal education

00:00:24.380 --> 00:00:28.070 align:middle line:10%
assembled arguably the
greatest compendium

00:00:28.070 --> 00:00:32.310 align:middle line:10%
of symbolic, mythical, and
occult wisdom ever assembled.

00:00:32.310 --> 00:00:34.280 align:middle line:84%
One of the dangers
of these principles,

00:00:34.280 --> 00:00:37.490 align:middle line:84%
like "know thyself," is that
they sound so familiar to us

00:00:37.490 --> 00:00:38.630 align:middle line:90%
that we walk past them.

00:00:38.630 --> 00:00:39.700 align:middle line:90%
We think, oh, I get it.

00:00:39.700 --> 00:00:40.550 align:middle line:90%
I know that already.

00:00:40.550 --> 00:00:42.260 align:middle line:84%
If you really take
up the question of,

00:00:42.260 --> 00:00:44.630 align:middle line:84%
what does it mean to
know thyself, who am I,

00:00:44.630 --> 00:00:46.790 align:middle line:84%
what do I stand
for, the individual

00:00:46.790 --> 00:00:49.475 align:middle line:84%
may come face to face with
things that are difficult.

00:00:49.475 --> 00:00:53.840 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: This amazing
body of work, everyone

00:00:53.840 --> 00:00:55.698 align:middle line:90%
should have a copy of it.

00:00:55.698 --> 00:00:58.168 align:middle line:90%

00:00:58.168 --> 00:01:01.140 align:middle line:90%


00:01:01.140 --> 00:01:03.540 align:middle line:10%
One of our more prolific
friends, Mitch Horowitz,

00:01:03.540 --> 00:01:06.570 align:middle line:10%
is back with us today with
his newest ancient work,

00:01:06.570 --> 00:01:08.790 align:middle line:10%
"The Secret Teachings
of All Ages."

00:01:08.790 --> 00:01:12.300 align:middle line:10%
This body of work was first
curated by a 27-year-old man

00:01:12.300 --> 00:01:14.640 align:middle line:10%
who, like Mitch, spent
his lifetime trying

00:01:14.640 --> 00:01:17.500 align:middle line:10%
to understand the underpinnings
of the great mysteries.

00:01:17.500 --> 00:01:19.530 align:middle line:10%
This can be an
intimidating body of work.

00:01:19.530 --> 00:01:22.700 align:middle line:10%
But Mitch has made it much
more easily decipherable for us

00:01:22.700 --> 00:01:23.500 align:middle line:10%
in your work.

00:01:23.500 --> 00:01:25.140 align:middle line:10%
Thank you so much for
being back, Mitch.

00:01:25.140 --> 00:01:25.590 align:middle line:10%
>>HOROWITZ: Thank you.

00:01:25.590 --> 00:01:26.130 align:middle line:10%
Great to see you.

00:01:26.130 --> 00:01:26.950 align:middle line:10%
>>REGINA: I love it.

00:01:26.950 --> 00:01:29.310 align:middle line:10%
And I love the fact that you're
writing about Manly P. Hall.

00:01:29.310 --> 00:01:31.560 align:middle line:10%
I love that you're writing
about "The Secret Teachings

00:01:31.560 --> 00:01:32.790 align:middle line:10%
of All Ages."

00:01:32.790 --> 00:01:38.940 align:middle line:10%
And you know, Manley P. Hall,
he holds such a dear place

00:01:38.940 --> 00:01:40.650 align:middle line:10%
in the heart of
people who knew him.

00:01:40.650 --> 00:01:43.170 align:middle line:84%
And he ended up
having, in a sense,

00:01:43.170 --> 00:01:45.450 align:middle line:84%
kind of a tragic
story toward the end.

00:01:45.450 --> 00:01:50.160 align:middle line:84%
But that was driven by the
fact that this amazing body

00:01:50.160 --> 00:01:52.590 align:middle line:84%
of work, everyone should
have a copy of it.

00:01:52.590 --> 00:01:55.170 align:middle line:84%
It was done when he
was 27 years old.

00:01:55.170 --> 00:01:59.040 align:middle line:10%
>>HOROWITZ: That is really one
of the mysteries of the 20th

00:01:59.040 --> 00:02:01.770 align:middle line:10%
century study of the
occult and esotericism--

00:02:01.770 --> 00:02:06.870 align:middle line:10%
how a 27-year-old man
with no formal education,

00:02:06.870 --> 00:02:09.810 align:middle line:10%
was raised by his grandmother
in the American West--

00:02:09.810 --> 00:02:13.230 align:middle line:10%
the Dakotas and other
parts of the West--

00:02:13.230 --> 00:02:17.850 align:middle line:10%
really had maybe just a few
months of formal schooling,

00:02:17.850 --> 00:02:21.390 align:middle line:10%
could have assembled
arguably the greatest

00:02:21.390 --> 00:02:25.770 align:middle line:10%
compendium of symbolic,
mythical, and occult wisdom

00:02:25.770 --> 00:02:26.860 align:middle line:10%
ever assembled.

00:02:26.860 --> 00:02:28.200 align:middle line:90%
And that was Manly P. Hall.

00:02:28.200 --> 00:02:29.000 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: It was.

00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:32.670 align:middle line:84%
And as his life went on, I
mean, there were great cons

00:02:32.670 --> 00:02:37.500 align:middle line:84%
and struggles and plots and such
to secure access to the rights

00:02:37.500 --> 00:02:41.440 align:middle line:84%
to his work and so forth, much
of which was in a vault, right?

00:02:41.440 --> 00:02:42.240 align:middle line:90%
>>HOROWITZ: Mhm.

00:02:42.240 --> 00:02:44.910 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: It ended up in
a vault. And much of it

00:02:44.910 --> 00:02:46.810 align:middle line:90%
is still protected.

00:02:46.810 --> 00:02:50.370 align:middle line:84%
And yet some of it
had to be sold off,

00:02:50.370 --> 00:02:52.200 align:middle line:84%
fortunately some of
it, like you say,

00:02:52.200 --> 00:02:53.620 align:middle line:84%
the Getty Museum,
which is great.

00:02:53.620 --> 00:02:55.170 align:middle line:84%
So it's still in
the public domain.

00:02:55.170 --> 00:02:56.910 align:middle line:90%
Much of it had to be sold off.

00:02:56.910 --> 00:02:59.490 align:middle line:10%
But if anyone has a chance
to get hold of this book--

00:02:59.490 --> 00:03:03.600 align:middle line:10%
and the artistic
renderings that are

00:03:03.600 --> 00:03:06.600 align:middle line:10%
in this book of the
information he's providing,

00:03:06.600 --> 00:03:09.450 align:middle line:10%
it is something that you could
study a lifetime and still

00:03:09.450 --> 00:03:12.168 align:middle line:10%
maybe never truly
comprehend the depth of.

00:03:12.168 --> 00:03:13.710 align:middle line:10%
>>HOROWITZ: I think
that's very true.

00:03:13.710 --> 00:03:16.320 align:middle line:10%
One of the artists with whom
Manly Hall collaborated,

00:03:16.320 --> 00:03:18.270 align:middle line:10%
his chief
collaborator, was a man

00:03:18.270 --> 00:03:21.000 align:middle line:10%
named J. Augustus
Knapp, who created

00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:23.740 align:middle line:10%
many of the color images that
exist in "The Secret Teachings

00:03:23.740 --> 00:03:24.540 align:middle line:10%
of All Ages."

00:03:24.540 --> 00:03:28.530 align:middle line:10%
But Manly also used images
from the Renaissance,

00:03:28.530 --> 00:03:32.220 align:middle line:10%
from the Middle Ages, from the
work of different antiquarians.

00:03:32.220 --> 00:03:35.400 align:middle line:84%
The book is so epic
and so monumental,

00:03:35.400 --> 00:03:38.880 align:middle line:84%
I feel like you could read
it every day of your life

00:03:38.880 --> 00:03:42.030 align:middle line:84%
and never really, fully
feel that you're finished.

00:03:42.030 --> 00:03:44.510 align:middle line:84%
There's an endless
elasticity to it.

00:03:44.510 --> 00:03:47.010 align:middle line:84%
It's one of the most mysterious
books ever written, I think.

00:03:47.010 --> 00:03:49.020 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: I think, as
you say, the big mystery

00:03:49.020 --> 00:03:49.978 align:middle line:90%
is, how did he do that?

00:03:49.978 --> 00:03:51.187 align:middle line:90%
>>HOROWITZ: How did he do it?

00:03:51.187 --> 00:03:52.650 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Where
did that come from?

00:03:52.650 --> 00:03:56.820 align:middle line:84%
Before we get into his
understanding of philosophy

00:03:56.820 --> 00:04:00.360 align:middle line:84%
in the nature you speak of
and he speaks of, how do

00:04:00.360 --> 00:04:01.260 align:middle line:90%
you think--

00:04:01.260 --> 00:04:04.757 align:middle line:84%
how would you guess that he
came about this knowledge?

00:04:04.757 --> 00:04:07.215 align:middle line:84%
>>HOROWITZ: Well, there are
all kinds of different theories

00:04:07.215 --> 00:04:07.470 align:middle line:90%
about--

00:04:07.470 --> 00:04:08.720 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Of course there are.

00:04:08.720 --> 00:04:10.770 align:middle line:84%
>>HOROWITZ: --reincarnation
and walk-in spirits.

00:04:10.770 --> 00:04:11.988 align:middle line:90%
And some people fancy him--

00:04:11.988 --> 00:04:14.280 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: I'm just having
you share your point of view.

00:04:14.280 --> 00:04:16.019 align:middle line:84%
>>HOROWITZ: Well, I'll tell
you what my point of view is.

00:04:16.019 --> 00:04:17.680 align:middle line:90%
And I mean this very seriously.

00:04:17.680 --> 00:04:19.800 align:middle line:10%
I think that if you look
at somebody you venerate,

00:04:19.800 --> 00:04:21.600 align:middle line:10%
you should always
ask, what can I

00:04:21.600 --> 00:04:24.900 align:middle line:10%
learn in a very
practical, immediate way

00:04:24.900 --> 00:04:26.110 align:middle line:10%
from this person's life?

00:04:26.110 --> 00:04:27.330 align:middle line:10%
And I will say this.

00:04:27.330 --> 00:04:30.480 align:middle line:10%
Manly Hall, at a
relatively young age,

00:04:30.480 --> 00:04:34.300 align:middle line:10%
was fortunate enough to discover
his passion, his true passion,

00:04:34.300 --> 00:04:36.420 align:middle line:10%
which was the study
of esotericism.

00:04:36.420 --> 00:04:38.820 align:middle line:10%
And I would ask everybody
to really think about that

00:04:38.820 --> 00:04:41.433 align:middle line:10%
and consider that because
we hear things like,

00:04:41.433 --> 00:04:42.600 align:middle line:10%
you should do what you love.

00:04:42.600 --> 00:04:45.960 align:middle line:10%
And it's easy to brush that off
because it sounds so familiar.

00:04:45.960 --> 00:04:49.650 align:middle line:10%
But the fact is if you can
identify your chief passion

00:04:49.650 --> 00:04:54.000 align:middle line:10%
in life, whatever it is, that
will summon in you energies

00:04:54.000 --> 00:04:55.660 align:middle line:10%
that you never knew you possess.

00:04:55.660 --> 00:04:58.040 align:middle line:10%
And I think Manly Hall is
a case in point of that.

00:04:58.040 --> 00:05:00.540 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Wherever he summoned
it from is up to speculation.

00:05:00.540 --> 00:05:01.340 align:middle line:90%
>>HOROWITZ: Yes.

00:05:01.340 --> 00:05:04.390 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: But he did summon
it because of the passion--

00:05:04.390 --> 00:05:05.390 align:middle line:90%
>>HOROWITZ: It did come.

00:05:05.390 --> 00:05:07.410 align:middle line:84%
--because of his
dedication to knowing.

00:05:07.410 --> 00:05:09.475 align:middle line:84%
You've done a very similar
thing with your life.

00:05:09.475 --> 00:05:11.080 align:middle line:84%
>>HOROWITZ: I feel
very fortunate.

00:05:11.080 --> 00:05:11.760 align:middle line:90%
I mean, it's the thing I--

00:05:11.760 --> 00:05:12.800 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: You've known
since you were a teenager.

00:05:12.800 --> 00:05:13.420 align:middle line:90%
>>HOROWITZ: Yeah.

00:05:13.420 --> 00:05:14.520 align:middle line:90%
Oh, even younger actually.

00:05:14.520 --> 00:05:15.710 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Oh, yeah,
a kid, a little kid.

00:05:15.710 --> 00:05:17.668 align:middle line:84%
>>HOROWITZ: It's the
thing I wish for everyone.

00:05:17.668 --> 00:05:20.700 align:middle line:84%
I discovered a fascination
for the occult within myself

00:05:20.700 --> 00:05:23.070 align:middle line:84%
when I was probably
about nine years old.

00:05:23.070 --> 00:05:26.290 align:middle line:84%
I remember my sister bringing
home books by Carlos Castaneda.

00:05:26.290 --> 00:05:27.090 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:05:27.090 --> 00:05:27.890 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHS]

00:05:27.890 --> 00:05:30.430 align:middle line:10%
>>HOROWITZ: And the Arrow Book
Club at my elementary school

00:05:30.430 --> 00:05:33.972 align:middle line:10%
would sell books on
Bigfoot, and flying saucers,

00:05:33.972 --> 00:05:34.930 align:middle line:10%
and so on and so forth.

00:05:34.930 --> 00:05:39.330 align:middle line:10%
And my wish for everybody
listening to this discussion

00:05:39.330 --> 00:05:42.750 align:middle line:10%
would be that they find
themselves, in adulthood,

00:05:42.750 --> 00:05:46.230 align:middle line:10%
able to take up the thread
of what inspired passion

00:05:46.230 --> 00:05:48.280 align:middle line:10%
in them when they
were very, very young.

00:05:48.280 --> 00:05:50.610 align:middle line:10%
That's been the great
fortune of my life,

00:05:50.610 --> 00:05:52.860 align:middle line:10%
that I have been
able, in adulthood,

00:05:52.860 --> 00:05:54.960 align:middle line:10%
to work with ideas that
were exciting to me

00:05:54.960 --> 00:05:56.140 align:middle line:10%
when I was nine years old.

00:05:56.140 --> 00:05:56.760 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Absolutely.

00:05:56.760 --> 00:05:58.343 align:middle line:84%
Very similar for me,
although I didn't

00:05:58.343 --> 00:05:59.660 align:middle line:90%
start till I was in my 20s.

00:05:59.660 --> 00:06:03.590 align:middle line:84%
But Andrew Harvey, who screamed
out and yelled one time,

00:06:03.590 --> 00:06:08.270 align:middle line:84%
he said, it's about the thing
that wakes you up at 3 o'clock

00:06:08.270 --> 00:06:09.440 align:middle line:90%
in the morning.

00:06:09.440 --> 00:06:12.317 align:middle line:84%
That's the thing you should be
dedicating your life to-- not

00:06:12.317 --> 00:06:14.150 align:middle line:84%
worrying about bills,
but the thing that you

00:06:14.150 --> 00:06:16.240 align:middle line:84%
feel passionate about at
3 o'clock in the morning.

00:06:16.240 --> 00:06:16.530 align:middle line:90%
>>HOROWITZ: Yes.

00:06:16.530 --> 00:06:17.810 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So I think
that kind of touches

00:06:17.810 --> 00:06:18.727 align:middle line:90%
on what you're saying.

00:06:18.727 --> 00:06:23.160 align:middle line:84%
So since we're getting
into a philosophy of life,

00:06:23.160 --> 00:06:25.550 align:middle line:84%
so to speak, through these
ancient lenses, let's

00:06:25.550 --> 00:06:30.200 align:middle line:84%
talk about philosophy for just a
moment without going dry on it.

00:06:30.200 --> 00:06:34.700 align:middle line:84%
My husband has a degree in
the philosophy of education.

00:06:34.700 --> 00:06:40.160 align:middle line:84%
My son has his degree in
classical philosophy, right?

00:06:40.160 --> 00:06:42.860 align:middle line:84%
And oftentimes they say
that's toilet paper.

00:06:42.860 --> 00:06:45.450 align:middle line:84%
That degree is as
good as toilet paper.

00:06:45.450 --> 00:06:47.960 align:middle line:84%
And if it comes to trying
to find a job where

00:06:47.960 --> 00:06:50.970 align:middle line:84%
you're going to gross a lot in
a given year, that may be true.

00:06:50.970 --> 00:06:53.030 align:middle line:84%
But the reality is I
don't think there's ever

00:06:53.030 --> 00:06:55.160 align:middle line:84%
been a time in
modern history when

00:06:55.160 --> 00:07:00.660 align:middle line:84%
we've needed a truly refined,
philosophical mind than right

00:07:00.660 --> 00:07:01.460 align:middle line:90%
now.

00:07:01.460 --> 00:07:03.418 align:middle line:84%
All the philosophers need
to start speaking up.

00:07:03.418 --> 00:07:04.377 align:middle line:90%
>>HOROWITZ: Absolutely.

00:07:04.377 --> 00:07:06.620 align:middle line:10%
>>REGINA: Let's talk about
what philosophy is though,

00:07:06.620 --> 00:07:08.578 align:middle line:10%
vis-á-vis Manly P. Hall
and your understanding.

00:07:08.578 --> 00:07:09.537 align:middle line:90%
>>HOROWITZ: Absolutely.

00:07:09.537 --> 00:07:11.030 align:middle line:84%
Well, philosophy
is love of wisdom.

00:07:11.030 --> 00:07:14.720 align:middle line:84%
And it's simply a way of asking,
what is a good way to live?

00:07:14.720 --> 00:07:17.330 align:middle line:10%
Any philosophy that doesn't
center on the question of,

00:07:17.330 --> 00:07:19.520 align:middle line:10%
what is a good way to
live, is scholasticism.

00:07:19.520 --> 00:07:21.410 align:middle line:10%
To me that's not
philosophy at all.

00:07:21.410 --> 00:07:24.980 align:middle line:10%
And Manly Hall believed, as did
William James and other people

00:07:24.980 --> 00:07:26.990 align:middle line:10%
who are heroes to
me, that philosophy

00:07:26.990 --> 00:07:29.720 align:middle line:10%
had to address itself
to the immediate needs

00:07:29.720 --> 00:07:31.670 align:middle line:10%
and questions of life.

00:07:31.670 --> 00:07:36.320 align:middle line:10%
And I feel very strongly that
that's what we need today.

00:07:36.320 --> 00:07:38.715 align:middle line:10%
Listen, we've been
philosophizing right now.

00:07:38.715 --> 00:07:40.340 align:middle line:84%
We've been talking
about the importance

00:07:40.340 --> 00:07:43.400 align:middle line:84%
of identifying a passion,
identifying what wakes you up

00:07:43.400 --> 00:07:47.150 align:middle line:84%
in a good way at 3:00 AM,
summoning from within you

00:07:47.150 --> 00:07:48.650 align:middle line:84%
that what you most
want to be doing.

00:07:48.650 --> 00:07:50.930 align:middle line:84%
And even if it doesn't
appear to be immediately

00:07:50.930 --> 00:07:53.750 align:middle line:84%
possible at this
given moment in time,

00:07:53.750 --> 00:07:56.690 align:middle line:84%
just identifying it--
just identifying it--

00:07:56.690 --> 00:07:58.748 align:middle line:84%
in a completely
unembarrassed way-- you

00:07:58.748 --> 00:08:00.290 align:middle line:84%
don't have to share
it with anybody--

00:08:00.290 --> 00:08:01.340 align:middle line:90%
what do you want in life?

00:08:01.340 --> 00:08:04.670 align:middle line:84%
What do you really want in life,
without any internalized peer

00:08:04.670 --> 00:08:06.243 align:middle line:84%
pressure, without
feeling that it

00:08:06.243 --> 00:08:08.160 align:middle line:84%
has to sound spiritually
correct or sanitized?

00:08:08.160 --> 00:08:09.660 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Or
analyzing it to death.

00:08:09.660 --> 00:08:12.050 align:middle line:90%
>>HOROWITZ: Yes.

00:08:12.050 --> 00:08:14.930 align:middle line:10%
Part of, I suppose,
my philosophical trip

00:08:14.930 --> 00:08:17.420 align:middle line:10%
at the present time
is I really want

00:08:17.420 --> 00:08:20.750 align:middle line:10%
people to be able to be
deeply frank and honest

00:08:20.750 --> 00:08:23.550 align:middle line:10%
with themselves about what
they want out of life,

00:08:23.550 --> 00:08:25.430 align:middle line:10%
even if it's
contrary to what they

00:08:25.430 --> 00:08:29.720 align:middle line:10%
think is correct in terms of
spiritual or religious terms.

00:08:29.720 --> 00:08:30.560 align:middle line:90%
Don't perfume it.

00:08:30.560 --> 00:08:31.520 align:middle line:90%
Don't sanitize it.

00:08:31.520 --> 00:08:33.260 align:middle line:84%
You don't have to
share it with anybody.

00:08:33.260 --> 00:08:35.430 align:middle line:84%
It's within the private
environs of your own psyche.

00:08:35.430 --> 00:08:36.230 align:middle line:90%
But at least know.

00:08:36.230 --> 00:08:36.919 align:middle line:90%
At least know.

00:08:36.919 --> 00:08:38.299 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: I couldn't agree more.

00:08:38.299 --> 00:08:41.380 align:middle line:84%
Now we're going to hop over
into Hermetics-- big part

00:08:41.380 --> 00:08:43.429 align:middle line:90%
of Manly P. Hall's work.

00:08:43.429 --> 00:08:47.600 align:middle line:84%
And after we kind of talk
about Hermetics itself--

00:08:47.600 --> 00:08:49.280 align:middle line:84%
because a lot of
people get confused

00:08:49.280 --> 00:08:52.890 align:middle line:84%
between the notion of Hermes
and Thoth and so forth--

00:08:52.890 --> 00:08:56.480 align:middle line:84%
let's break that down, what
this is, when this came to be,

00:08:56.480 --> 00:08:59.100 align:middle line:84%
when the Greeks met the
Egyptians and the interface

00:08:59.100 --> 00:08:59.900 align:middle line:90%
of it.

00:08:59.900 --> 00:09:02.180 align:middle line:84%
And then I'm going
to talk to you

00:09:02.180 --> 00:09:04.790 align:middle line:84%
about the notion
of "know thyself,"

00:09:04.790 --> 00:09:06.393 align:middle line:84%
because this is
greatly misunderstood.

00:09:06.393 --> 00:09:07.560 align:middle line:90%
>>HOROWITZ: Mhm, mhm.

00:09:07.560 --> 00:09:09.350 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So first
of all, tell us

00:09:09.350 --> 00:09:11.870 align:middle line:84%
who Hermes was,
who Thoth was, OK?

00:09:11.870 --> 00:09:14.600 align:middle line:84%
>>HOROWITZ: Well,
Hermes was the Greek god

00:09:14.600 --> 00:09:16.100 align:middle line:90%
of wisdom and writing.

00:09:16.100 --> 00:09:21.050 align:middle line:84%
And when the Greeks
encountered Thoth, or Toth,

00:09:21.050 --> 00:09:23.600 align:middle line:84%
Egypt's God of
intellect and writing,

00:09:23.600 --> 00:09:27.650 align:middle line:84%
they thought, wow, this is
the forerunner to our own God.

00:09:27.650 --> 00:09:29.370 align:middle line:90%
This is the real deal.

00:09:29.370 --> 00:09:33.590 align:middle line:10%
This figure of
Thoth is three times

00:09:33.590 --> 00:09:34.890 align:middle line:10%
as great as our own Hermes.

00:09:34.890 --> 00:09:37.310 align:middle line:10%
So they use the Greek phrase
"Hermes Trismegistus"--

00:09:37.310 --> 00:09:39.500 align:middle line:10%
three times greatest Hermes.

00:09:39.500 --> 00:09:41.810 align:middle line:10%
And the philosophy
of Hermeticism

00:09:41.810 --> 00:09:44.510 align:middle line:10%
is a branch of
Egyptian-Greek thought

00:09:44.510 --> 00:09:47.120 align:middle line:10%
that is named for
the God Hermes,

00:09:47.120 --> 00:09:49.130 align:middle line:10%
or the figure of
Hermes Trismegistus.

00:09:49.130 --> 00:09:52.520 align:middle line:10%
And basically it grew out of
the encounter between the Greeks

00:09:52.520 --> 00:09:54.680 align:middle line:10%
and the Egyptians in
what we would probably

00:09:54.680 --> 00:09:58.020 align:middle line:10%
consider the last stages
of Egyptian civilization.

00:09:58.020 --> 00:10:01.560 align:middle line:84%
This was the era of
Cleopatra and beyond.

00:10:01.560 --> 00:10:03.560 align:middle line:84%
These were the generations
immediately following

00:10:03.560 --> 00:10:04.790 align:middle line:90%
the death of Christ.

00:10:04.790 --> 00:10:08.570 align:middle line:84%
Egypt at that time was
under the domination

00:10:08.570 --> 00:10:11.240 align:middle line:90%
of a Greek political class.

00:10:11.240 --> 00:10:13.220 align:middle line:84%
And so you had
this intermingling

00:10:13.220 --> 00:10:18.710 align:middle line:84%
of Egyptian and Hellenic
culture for a few centuries

00:10:18.710 --> 00:10:21.500 align:middle line:84%
preceding and a few centuries
following the death of Christ.

00:10:21.500 --> 00:10:23.900 align:middle line:84%
Those were the final days
of Egyptian civilization

00:10:23.900 --> 00:10:25.988 align:middle line:84%
as we think of it in
terms of ancient Egypt.

00:10:25.988 --> 00:10:28.280 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And we're going
back to Cleopatra in a moment

00:10:28.280 --> 00:10:30.140 align:middle line:84%
because I love what you
had to write about her.

00:10:30.140 --> 00:10:32.170 align:middle line:84%
It was brief, but maybe you
can go in a little more detail.

00:10:32.170 --> 00:10:33.105 align:middle line:90%
>>HOROWITZ: Sure.

00:10:33.105 --> 00:10:34.938 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So when we're
talking about Thoth,

00:10:34.938 --> 00:10:37.020 align:middle line:84%
oftentimes you'll see
an ibis-headed man.

00:10:37.020 --> 00:10:37.820 align:middle line:90%
>>HOROWITZ: Yes.

00:10:37.820 --> 00:10:38.620 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right?

00:10:38.620 --> 00:10:41.090 align:middle line:84%
And the reason for that
being was the veneration

00:10:41.090 --> 00:10:42.965 align:middle line:90%
of the ibis itself, a waterbird.

00:10:42.965 --> 00:10:44.630 align:middle line:84%
>>HOROWITZ: The
ibis is a waterbird.

00:10:44.630 --> 00:10:47.180 align:middle line:84%
And the Egyptians
venerated the ibis.

00:10:47.180 --> 00:10:50.780 align:middle line:10%
They saw the ibis as a being
that could exist in all

00:10:50.780 --> 00:10:53.420 align:middle line:10%
the elements--
water, Earth, air--

00:10:53.420 --> 00:10:56.510 align:middle line:10%
and that could transcend
the earthly environs

00:10:56.510 --> 00:10:59.140 align:middle line:10%
to the greater cosmic environs.

00:10:59.140 --> 00:11:02.090 align:middle line:10%
So they saw the ibis as a
kind of a sacred messenger.

00:11:02.090 --> 00:11:02.890 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Mhm.

00:11:02.890 --> 00:11:05.920 align:middle line:84%
So that gets down to the names,
the confusion of the names,

00:11:05.920 --> 00:11:07.185 align:middle line:90%
and why he has a bird's head.

00:11:07.185 --> 00:11:08.560 align:middle line:84%
>>HOROWITZ: He
has a bird's head.

00:11:08.560 --> 00:11:10.090 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: OK, and not to
be confused with Horus,

00:11:10.090 --> 00:11:11.150 align:middle line:90%
which we'll get into--

00:11:11.150 --> 00:11:11.950 align:middle line:90%
the falcon's head.

00:11:11.950 --> 00:11:12.220 align:middle line:90%
>>HOROWITZ: Right.

00:11:12.220 --> 00:11:13.553 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: This is the ibis head.

00:11:13.553 --> 00:11:16.780 align:middle line:84%
OK, so let's talk about the
notion of "know thyself."

00:11:16.780 --> 00:11:18.640 align:middle line:84%
Oh, no, first let's
talk about Cleopatra

00:11:18.640 --> 00:11:20.200 align:middle line:84%
before we go into
"know thyself."

00:11:20.200 --> 00:11:23.440 align:middle line:84%
So in your book, you were
stating that it really

00:11:23.440 --> 00:11:28.120 align:middle line:84%
was Cleopatra, of Greek origin,
who was the one who really

00:11:28.120 --> 00:11:33.040 align:middle line:84%
started re-instantiating a
lot of the ancient customs

00:11:33.040 --> 00:11:36.645 align:middle line:84%
and beauty and such of the
former glory days of Egypt.

00:11:36.645 --> 00:11:38.020 align:middle line:84%
Tell us a little
more about that.

00:11:38.020 --> 00:11:39.160 align:middle line:90%
I did not know that.

00:11:39.160 --> 00:11:40.618 align:middle line:84%
>>HOROWITZ: Yeah,
it's interesting.

00:11:40.618 --> 00:11:43.060 align:middle line:10%
If you ask people to
name one Egyptian ruler,

00:11:43.060 --> 00:11:44.410 align:middle line:10%
they'll name Cleopatra.

00:11:44.410 --> 00:11:46.660 align:middle line:10%
You know, that's a name,
like Julius Caesar,

00:11:46.660 --> 00:11:49.870 align:middle line:10%
that has reached us through
the annals of history.

00:11:49.870 --> 00:11:51.770 align:middle line:10%
Cleopatra was Greek.

00:11:51.770 --> 00:11:54.460 align:middle line:10%
And she was venerated
by the Egyptian people

00:11:54.460 --> 00:11:58.570 align:middle line:10%
because she reinstated the
temple orders and the mystery

00:11:58.570 --> 00:12:02.140 align:middle line:10%
religions and the initiatory
rights which had been withering

00:12:02.140 --> 00:12:03.220 align:middle line:10%
for several centuries.

00:12:03.220 --> 00:12:07.750 align:middle line:84%
Again, Egypt was under both
Greek and Roman domination.

00:12:07.750 --> 00:12:09.880 align:middle line:84%
Rome was really
the military power.

00:12:09.880 --> 00:12:14.110 align:middle line:84%
And Greeks were the governmental
and the administrative class.

00:12:14.110 --> 00:12:18.490 align:middle line:10%
And to some extent,
in its late stages,

00:12:18.490 --> 00:12:22.210 align:middle line:10%
ancient Egypt was
basically a colony of Rome.

00:12:22.210 --> 00:12:25.840 align:middle line:10%
And hence the religious
traditions had been withering.

00:12:25.840 --> 00:12:28.600 align:middle line:10%
But Cleopatra came in.

00:12:28.600 --> 00:12:32.020 align:middle line:10%
And about 50 years before
the death of Christ,

00:12:32.020 --> 00:12:36.370 align:middle line:10%
she reinstituted and revived
a lot of the priesthoods

00:12:36.370 --> 00:12:38.650 align:middle line:10%
and the temple orders
and the monuments,

00:12:38.650 --> 00:12:39.880 align:middle line:10%
did a lot of public works.

00:12:39.880 --> 00:12:41.648 align:middle line:84%
And as such, she was
loved and venerated

00:12:41.648 --> 00:12:42.940 align:middle line:90%
by many of the Egyptian people.

00:12:42.940 --> 00:12:43.420 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: I love that.

00:12:43.420 --> 00:12:44.410 align:middle line:90%
I loved hearing that.

00:12:44.410 --> 00:12:47.618 align:middle line:84%
And you're looking back
through Egyptian history.

00:12:47.618 --> 00:12:49.660 align:middle line:84%
We're not going to go into
it too much because we

00:12:49.660 --> 00:12:50.880 align:middle line:90%
have so much to cover here.

00:12:50.880 --> 00:12:51.680 align:middle line:90%
>>HOROWITZ: Yeah.

00:12:51.680 --> 00:12:54.790 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: But what would
you say was the highest

00:12:54.790 --> 00:12:57.130 align:middle line:90%
spiritual culture?

00:12:57.130 --> 00:13:00.160 align:middle line:84%
What era had the highest
spiritual culture

00:13:00.160 --> 00:13:01.908 align:middle line:90%
in your own estimation?

00:13:01.908 --> 00:13:02.950 align:middle line:90%
>>HOROWITZ: Wow, that's--

00:13:02.950 --> 00:13:03.580 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: I mean,
because it's a--

00:13:03.580 --> 00:13:04.280 align:middle line:84%
>>HOROWITZ: --a
wonderful question.

00:13:04.280 --> 00:13:06.340 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And then we'll get
into an esoteric idea of how

00:13:06.340 --> 00:13:07.680 align:middle line:90%
old that civilization truly is.

00:13:07.680 --> 00:13:08.100 align:middle line:90%
>>HOROWITZ: Yeah, yeah, yeah.

00:13:08.100 --> 00:13:09.250 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: That's a
whole different deal.

00:13:09.250 --> 00:13:09.640 align:middle line:90%
>>HOROWITZ: Right.

00:13:09.640 --> 00:13:10.890 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: But in your opinion.

00:13:10.890 --> 00:13:13.840 align:middle line:10%
>>HOROWITZ: Look, there were
so many different phases

00:13:13.840 --> 00:13:15.730 align:middle line:10%
of life in ancient
Egypt, this empire that

00:13:15.730 --> 00:13:17.310 align:middle line:10%
went on for thousands of years.

00:13:17.310 --> 00:13:19.060 align:middle line:10%
And it's difficult for
us to even conceive

00:13:19.060 --> 00:13:21.790 align:middle line:10%
of it's true antiquity.

00:13:21.790 --> 00:13:27.010 align:middle line:10%
I do think that the Hermetic
Era, these generations

00:13:27.010 --> 00:13:28.810 align:middle line:10%
immediately following
the death of Christ,

00:13:28.810 --> 00:13:31.480 align:middle line:10%
was a unique time
because it represented

00:13:31.480 --> 00:13:34.390 align:middle line:10%
a marriage of ancient
Egyptian thought

00:13:34.390 --> 00:13:37.210 align:middle line:10%
and what we think of as
classical Western thought.

00:13:37.210 --> 00:13:39.280 align:middle line:10%
And it represented
a period of time

00:13:39.280 --> 00:13:42.070 align:middle line:10%
in which you had Greek
scholars and scribes who

00:13:42.070 --> 00:13:45.670 align:middle line:10%
were writing down Egyptian
esoteric philosophy

00:13:45.670 --> 00:13:48.610 align:middle line:10%
in the Greek language, a
language that is accessible

00:13:48.610 --> 00:13:51.820 align:middle line:10%
to Western people, as opposed
to the more symbolic language

00:13:51.820 --> 00:13:52.660 align:middle line:10%
of hieroglyphs--

00:13:52.660 --> 00:13:53.420 align:middle line:10%
>>REGINA: Very important.

00:13:53.420 --> 00:13:54.920 align:middle line:84%
>>HOROWITZ: --which
we couldn't even

00:13:54.920 --> 00:13:59.740 align:middle line:84%
decipher until probably at
the beginning of the 1800s

00:13:59.740 --> 00:14:01.390 align:middle line:84%
after the Rosetta
Stone was discovered.

00:14:01.390 --> 00:14:02.190 align:middle line:10%
So Egypt--

00:14:02.190 --> 00:14:04.232 align:middle line:10%
>>REGINA: Was it flowing
from the priestly class,

00:14:04.232 --> 00:14:05.860 align:middle line:10%
the remnants of
the priestly class?

00:14:05.860 --> 00:14:07.900 align:middle line:10%
>>HOROWITZ: Yes, I
believe that was the case.

00:14:07.900 --> 00:14:10.150 align:middle line:10%
There was sort of a
marriage of interests

00:14:10.150 --> 00:14:14.720 align:middle line:10%
between the priestly class and
the Greek administrative class.

00:14:14.720 --> 00:14:17.680 align:middle line:10%
And the fact that
the Greek class

00:14:17.680 --> 00:14:20.140 align:middle line:10%
was able to write some
of these ideas down,

00:14:20.140 --> 00:14:23.170 align:middle line:10%
maybe just fragments but
some, in a language that

00:14:23.170 --> 00:14:27.130 align:middle line:10%
was accessible to Westerners is
what has given us the ability

00:14:27.130 --> 00:14:29.440 align:middle line:10%
to peer into Egyptian
civilization in ways

00:14:29.440 --> 00:14:31.075 align:middle line:10%
that we might not possess today.

00:14:31.075 --> 00:14:35.830 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: In one document
of supposed Hermetic origin,

00:14:35.830 --> 00:14:40.090 align:middle line:84%
I read that the
secret understanding,

00:14:40.090 --> 00:14:42.940 align:middle line:84%
in terms of the antiquity
of the Egyptian culture,

00:14:42.940 --> 00:14:45.620 align:middle line:90%
takes it back far beyond--

00:14:45.620 --> 00:14:47.440 align:middle line:84%
you write about Robert
Schoch and everyone;

00:14:47.440 --> 00:14:49.120 align:middle line:90%
and we know them--

00:14:49.120 --> 00:14:53.590 align:middle line:84%
far beyond that to
up to 200,000 years.

00:14:53.590 --> 00:14:56.080 align:middle line:84%
Robert Schoch himself
privately says

00:14:56.080 --> 00:14:59.050 align:middle line:84%
that the pyramid, he believes,
is about 100,000 years old,

00:14:59.050 --> 00:15:00.820 align:middle line:90%
the Great Pyramid of Giza.

00:15:00.820 --> 00:15:02.620 align:middle line:84%
So we're looking
at something-- we

00:15:02.620 --> 00:15:06.040 align:middle line:84%
have no understanding of
what ancient history is

00:15:06.040 --> 00:15:09.610 align:middle line:84%
because right now, even going
back like you do in the book

00:15:09.610 --> 00:15:13.750 align:middle line:84%
to 10,000 years, breaks
all the rules of Egyptology

00:15:13.750 --> 00:15:16.450 align:middle line:84%
because they don't want
that story changed.

00:15:16.450 --> 00:15:19.090 align:middle line:84%
And let's talk about--
this is really important.

00:15:19.090 --> 00:15:21.280 align:middle line:84%
If we understand that
that Great Pyramid can

00:15:21.280 --> 00:15:24.400 align:middle line:84%
be 85,000 to 100,000
years old, that

00:15:24.400 --> 00:15:28.210 align:middle line:84%
means we had very sophisticated
cultures in deep antiquity.

00:15:28.210 --> 00:15:32.052 align:middle line:84%
Why do the Egyptians insist on
covering up the dates of things

00:15:32.052 --> 00:15:33.010 align:middle line:90%
even though they have--

00:15:33.010 --> 00:15:36.190 align:middle line:84%
essentially there's a lot
of evidence for showing that

00:15:36.190 --> 00:15:39.130 align:middle line:90%
the Sphinx--

00:15:39.130 --> 00:15:41.560 align:middle line:84%
the word was leaving me--
the Sphinx is up to 10,000,

00:15:41.560 --> 00:15:42.790 align:middle line:90%
12,000 years old.

00:15:42.790 --> 00:15:43.890 align:middle line:90%
Why are they doing this?

00:15:43.890 --> 00:15:44.890 align:middle line:90%
Why do they continue it?

00:15:44.890 --> 00:15:46.120 align:middle line:90%
It doesn't serve us.

00:15:46.120 --> 00:15:48.430 align:middle line:10%
>>HOROWITZ: It's really
a fascinating question.

00:15:48.430 --> 00:15:49.780 align:middle line:10%
And it's a question of history.

00:15:49.780 --> 00:15:50.950 align:middle line:10%
It's a question of politics.

00:15:50.950 --> 00:15:52.750 align:middle line:10%
It's a question of human nature.

00:15:52.750 --> 00:15:55.660 align:middle line:10%
I'm a big defender of the
Schoch-West thesis, which

00:15:55.660 --> 00:15:58.690 align:middle line:10%
is, in its most
conservative iteration,

00:15:58.690 --> 00:16:01.690 align:middle line:10%
that the oldest portions
of the Great Sphinx

00:16:01.690 --> 00:16:07.030 align:middle line:10%
show water damage that would
predate it to possibly 7,500

00:16:07.030 --> 00:16:08.633 align:middle line:10%
BC, maybe as old as 10,000 BC.

00:16:08.633 --> 00:16:11.050 align:middle line:84%
And that's the most conservative
iteration in that thesis.

00:16:11.050 --> 00:16:11.850 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Oh, yeah.

00:16:11.850 --> 00:16:14.080 align:middle line:84%
And privately, John Anthony
West told me 35,000.

00:16:14.080 --> 00:16:15.068 align:middle line:90%
>>HOROWITZ: Yes, yes.

00:16:15.068 --> 00:16:17.110 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So yeah, they're
just being polite just

00:16:17.110 --> 00:16:19.300 align:middle line:84%
to get it in the ballpark
someone can contend with.

00:16:19.300 --> 00:16:21.217 align:middle line:84%
>>HOROWITZ: We're just
trying to sort of crack

00:16:21.217 --> 00:16:24.010 align:middle line:84%
open the door so that we
can begin to question some

00:16:24.010 --> 00:16:25.700 align:middle line:90%
of the traditional timeline.

00:16:25.700 --> 00:16:26.500 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:16:26.500 --> 00:16:29.440 align:middle line:10%
>>HOROWITZ: Now, when I
speak with people about this,

00:16:29.440 --> 00:16:32.050 align:middle line:10%
naturally they say, well, this
is a fascinating question.

00:16:32.050 --> 00:16:34.780 align:middle line:84%
Why aren't there grad students
and archaeologists and--

00:16:34.780 --> 00:16:35.050 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right, yeah.

00:16:35.050 --> 00:16:37.383 align:middle line:10%
>>HOROWITZ: --antiquities
people who want to study this?

00:16:37.383 --> 00:16:38.860 align:middle line:10%
And the truth is there are.

00:16:38.860 --> 00:16:42.850 align:middle line:10%
But it is profoundly difficult
to get past the licensing

00:16:42.850 --> 00:16:45.130 align:middle line:10%
requirements within
Egypt to study

00:16:45.130 --> 00:16:46.930 align:middle line:10%
some of these antiquities.

00:16:46.930 --> 00:16:48.340 align:middle line:90%
There are politics.

00:16:48.340 --> 00:16:51.430 align:middle line:84%
There are issues of
nationalism bound up with it.

00:16:51.430 --> 00:16:54.070 align:middle line:90%
There are academic pressures.

00:16:54.070 --> 00:16:58.060 align:middle line:10%
If you are a grad
student in archaeology

00:16:58.060 --> 00:17:01.930 align:middle line:10%
and you even want to
study the pyramids, much

00:17:01.930 --> 00:17:04.450 align:middle line:10%
less their antiquity,
but study the pyramids,

00:17:04.450 --> 00:17:07.030 align:middle line:10%
you're looked at kind of funny
because that's considered

00:17:07.030 --> 00:17:08.470 align:middle line:10%
to be settled science.

00:17:08.470 --> 00:17:11.800 align:middle line:10%
And if, heaven forbid,
you start questioning

00:17:11.800 --> 00:17:15.310 align:middle line:10%
the traditional timeline,
what you are implicitly doing

00:17:15.310 --> 00:17:19.390 align:middle line:10%
is questioning the reference
points of the very people who

00:17:19.390 --> 00:17:22.420 align:middle line:10%
are in charge of your
graduate studies,

00:17:22.420 --> 00:17:26.890 align:middle line:10%
who are in degree-granting
situations, who have authority

00:17:26.890 --> 00:17:29.830 align:middle line:10%
over you in terms
of granting you

00:17:29.830 --> 00:17:31.755 align:middle line:10%
teaching-assistant
positions and approving

00:17:31.755 --> 00:17:33.130 align:middle line:10%
your oral examinations
and so on.

00:17:33.130 --> 00:17:34.820 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: No less if you're
at the top of the tree

00:17:34.820 --> 00:17:35.950 align:middle line:84%
and you could be
stripped of tenure

00:17:35.950 --> 00:17:37.117 align:middle line:90%
for going outside the lines.

00:17:37.117 --> 00:17:39.520 align:middle line:10%
>>HOROWITZ: And you're
questioning the timeline

00:17:39.520 --> 00:17:43.330 align:middle line:10%
upon which the people who
are evaluating your studies

00:17:43.330 --> 00:17:44.680 align:middle line:10%
have based their research.

00:17:44.680 --> 00:17:46.000 align:middle line:10%
So you can't really go there.

00:17:46.000 --> 00:17:47.300 align:middle line:10%
You can't really go there.

00:17:47.300 --> 00:17:51.340 align:middle line:10%
So if you are an ambitious,
young grad student

00:17:51.340 --> 00:17:54.730 align:middle line:10%
in archaeology and you want to
find your way within mainstream

00:17:54.730 --> 00:17:58.090 align:middle line:10%
academia, to even raise these
questions is a red letter.

00:17:58.090 --> 00:18:01.390 align:middle line:84%
So unfortunately we have
lost a whole generation

00:18:01.390 --> 00:18:04.570 align:middle line:84%
since the Schoch-West thesis
was first brought to light.

00:18:04.570 --> 00:18:05.902 align:middle line:90%
And it has not been studied.

00:18:05.902 --> 00:18:07.610 align:middle line:84%
It's not a question
of it's been studied,

00:18:07.610 --> 00:18:09.735 align:middle line:84%
and it's been debunked, or
there's this controversy

00:18:09.735 --> 00:18:11.080 align:middle line:90%
or that controversy.

00:18:11.080 --> 00:18:14.080 align:middle line:84%
The initial findings
were aired, were debated.

00:18:14.080 --> 00:18:15.842 align:middle line:90%
And still water, dead water.

00:18:15.842 --> 00:18:17.800 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: That they call
that "settled science"

00:18:17.800 --> 00:18:19.030 align:middle line:90%
is arrogant beyond belief.

00:18:19.030 --> 00:18:22.990 align:middle line:84%
The one thing, the one tenet, of
science is it is never settled.

00:18:22.990 --> 00:18:24.490 align:middle line:90%
And it should never be settled.

00:18:24.490 --> 00:18:27.340 align:middle line:84%
It should constantly be
inquiring and growing.

00:18:27.340 --> 00:18:29.650 align:middle line:84%
And that they call
this a settled case

00:18:29.650 --> 00:18:33.640 align:middle line:84%
in the scientific sense is
just enraging to me because

00:18:33.640 --> 00:18:37.360 align:middle line:84%
so much about who we are as
humans, our capabilities,

00:18:37.360 --> 00:18:39.280 align:middle line:84%
our ancient history
is lost to us

00:18:39.280 --> 00:18:41.710 align:middle line:84%
as a result of these
kinds of governmental

00:18:41.710 --> 00:18:42.570 align:middle line:90%
dictates basically.

00:18:42.570 --> 00:18:44.153 align:middle line:84%
>>HOROWITZ: Yeah,
it's really a shame.

00:18:44.153 --> 00:18:46.840 align:middle line:10%
And one of the reasons why
it's so difficult for people

00:18:46.840 --> 00:18:49.540 align:middle line:10%
to study the great
monuments nowadays is that--

00:18:49.540 --> 00:18:52.270 align:middle line:10%
and I write about this
in "The Seeker's Guide"--

00:18:52.270 --> 00:18:55.798 align:middle line:10%
within the Egyptian
government, and this

00:18:55.798 --> 00:18:58.090 align:middle line:10%
is true in many different
governments around the world,

00:18:58.090 --> 00:19:00.070 align:middle line:10%
there is an outlook
that if you begin

00:19:00.070 --> 00:19:03.490 align:middle line:10%
to predate the monuments
to an earlier time,

00:19:03.490 --> 00:19:06.498 align:middle line:10%
it strips them of their
Egyptian national identity.

00:19:06.498 --> 00:19:08.540 align:middle line:84%
And I don't think that
should be the case at all.

00:19:08.540 --> 00:19:09.670 align:middle line:84%
If anything, it
deepens the identity.

00:19:09.670 --> 00:19:10.480 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: No, it
should enhance it.

00:19:10.480 --> 00:19:11.605 align:middle line:90%
>>HOROWITZ: It enhances it.

00:19:11.605 --> 00:19:15.430 align:middle line:84%
It enhances the gravity of
what this civilization was.

00:19:15.430 --> 00:19:16.660 align:middle line:90%
It doesn't detract from it.

00:19:16.660 --> 00:19:19.000 align:middle line:84%
And it doesn't strip
it of Egyptian origin.

00:19:19.000 --> 00:19:21.550 align:middle line:10%
It tells us that
Egyptian origin is

00:19:21.550 --> 00:19:23.770 align:middle line:10%
even more epic,
even greater, even

00:19:23.770 --> 00:19:25.690 align:middle line:10%
older than we've understood.

00:19:25.690 --> 00:19:27.257 align:middle line:10%
So it's a political clash.

00:19:27.257 --> 00:19:28.840 align:middle line:10%
And it's very difficult
to get around.

00:19:28.840 --> 00:19:30.680 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Yeah,
and you went there,

00:19:30.680 --> 00:19:32.857 align:middle line:90%
your film, "The Kybalion."

00:19:32.857 --> 00:19:34.690 align:middle line:84%
You had to deal with a
lot of this yourself.

00:19:34.690 --> 00:19:35.720 align:middle line:84%
>>HOROWITZ: A lot
of this myself.

00:19:35.720 --> 00:19:38.110 align:middle line:84%
Let me tell you, getting
licensing rights to even--

00:19:38.110 --> 00:19:38.440 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Oh, boy.

00:19:38.440 --> 00:19:40.482 align:middle line:84%
>>HOROWITZ: --film there
is enormously expensive,

00:19:40.482 --> 00:19:43.570 align:middle line:84%
enormously difficult. It's
fraught with complexities.

00:19:43.570 --> 00:19:46.690 align:middle line:84%
And we were lucky because we
were there before the lockdown.

00:19:46.690 --> 00:19:48.520 align:middle line:90%
So we were there in 2019.

00:19:48.520 --> 00:19:51.320 align:middle line:10%
And we were able to film
parts of our story there.

00:19:51.320 --> 00:19:52.622 align:middle line:10%
And that was very gratifying.

00:19:52.622 --> 00:19:54.580 align:middle line:10%
>>REGINA: We'll talk
about that at the very end

00:19:54.580 --> 00:19:56.860 align:middle line:10%
of our conversation again,
too, because I've only

00:19:56.860 --> 00:19:57.910 align:middle line:10%
seen a little clip.

00:19:57.910 --> 00:19:59.980 align:middle line:84%
I can't wait to see
the entire thing.

00:19:59.980 --> 00:20:02.990 align:middle line:84%
OK, so now we're going into
some of the basic concepts.

00:20:02.990 --> 00:20:05.840 align:middle line:84%
First of all, Manly P.
Hall lived comfortably

00:20:05.840 --> 00:20:07.840 align:middle line:84%
at the understanding that
there was once a place

00:20:07.840 --> 00:20:09.250 align:middle line:90%
called Atlantis.

00:20:09.250 --> 00:20:13.900 align:middle line:84%
And if you look at the
fact, well, the notion

00:20:13.900 --> 00:20:16.840 align:middle line:84%
that Egypt could have existed
up to 100,000 years ago,

00:20:16.840 --> 00:20:19.240 align:middle line:84%
200,000 years ago,
then you would think--

00:20:19.240 --> 00:20:21.100 align:middle line:84%
it would be very
interesting to people

00:20:21.100 --> 00:20:23.290 align:middle line:84%
that these societies
ran concurrently.

00:20:23.290 --> 00:20:26.170 align:middle line:84%
And so what could have been any
kind of exchange of knowledge,

00:20:26.170 --> 00:20:27.760 align:middle line:90%
culture, and information?

00:20:27.760 --> 00:20:31.330 align:middle line:84%
Because the Hermetics argue
that their information is

00:20:31.330 --> 00:20:34.870 align:middle line:84%
passed on from Atlantean
times through the Egyptians.

00:20:34.870 --> 00:20:36.850 align:middle line:84%
So it brings up
another area that I

00:20:36.850 --> 00:20:38.680 align:middle line:84%
think would be very
interesting to dive

00:20:38.680 --> 00:20:40.690 align:middle line:90%
into if someone cared to.

00:20:40.690 --> 00:20:44.510 align:middle line:84%
But there are certain axioms
that remain true for both.

00:20:44.510 --> 00:20:47.440 align:middle line:84%
And that has to do-- one of
them, "as above, so below,"

00:20:47.440 --> 00:20:50.560 align:middle line:84%
which we're going to get
into, but "know thyself."

00:20:50.560 --> 00:20:54.220 align:middle line:84%
This is a big one because people
think, what's there to know?

00:20:54.220 --> 00:20:56.830 align:middle line:90%
Well, I know that I'm a doctor.

00:20:56.830 --> 00:21:01.500 align:middle line:90%
I make $750,000 a year.

00:21:01.500 --> 00:21:03.950 align:middle line:84%
That is about as far as
people go in knowing thyself.

00:21:03.950 --> 00:21:07.130 align:middle line:84%
But it's a very
complex breathing,

00:21:07.130 --> 00:21:09.020 align:middle line:90%
living, growing concept.

00:21:09.020 --> 00:21:10.250 align:middle line:90%
Please take it away on that.

00:21:10.250 --> 00:21:11.230 align:middle line:90%
>>HOROWITZ: Absolutely.

00:21:11.230 --> 00:21:14.120 align:middle line:10%
One of the dangers of these
principles, like know thyself,

00:21:14.120 --> 00:21:16.370 align:middle line:10%
is that they sound
so familiar to us,

00:21:16.370 --> 00:21:18.710 align:middle line:10%
as you were alluding,
that we walk past them.

00:21:18.710 --> 00:21:19.810 align:middle line:10%
We think, oh, I get it.

00:21:19.810 --> 00:21:22.370 align:middle line:84%
I know that already, where
it sounds like a slogan.

00:21:22.370 --> 00:21:24.440 align:middle line:84%
But if you really take
up the question of what

00:21:24.440 --> 00:21:27.050 align:middle line:84%
does it mean to know
thyself and you really

00:21:27.050 --> 00:21:31.370 align:middle line:84%
ask, who am I, what do I stand
for, what do I want in life,

00:21:31.370 --> 00:21:33.200 align:middle line:84%
the individual may
come face to face

00:21:33.200 --> 00:21:36.770 align:middle line:84%
with things that are difficult,
that are embarrassing,

00:21:36.770 --> 00:21:39.920 align:middle line:84%
that raise questions
about different corners

00:21:39.920 --> 00:21:42.770 align:middle line:84%
of our psyches that we don't
really want to go into.

00:21:42.770 --> 00:21:46.070 align:middle line:84%
We really internalize
peer pressure.

00:21:46.070 --> 00:21:49.650 align:middle line:84%
We internalize what we
believe is expected of us.

00:21:49.650 --> 00:21:51.620 align:middle line:84%
And even when we're
talking to ourselves

00:21:51.620 --> 00:21:56.120 align:middle line:84%
within the confines of our own
private mind, it's rehearsed.

00:21:56.120 --> 00:21:56.960 align:middle line:90%
It's rehearsed.

00:21:56.960 --> 00:21:58.400 align:middle line:84%
We're reciting
things to ourselves

00:21:58.400 --> 00:22:00.067 align:middle line:84%
that we think we're
supposed to believe,

00:22:00.067 --> 00:22:02.930 align:middle line:84%
that we think make us look
good and sound good to others.

00:22:02.930 --> 00:22:07.680 align:middle line:84%
And I ask people, give
yourself a moment in time.

00:22:07.680 --> 00:22:10.580 align:middle line:84%
Give yourself a moment in
time to tear up that script

00:22:10.580 --> 00:22:14.090 align:middle line:84%
and ask yourself, what do
you really, really want?

00:22:14.090 --> 00:22:15.860 align:middle line:84%
And it might really
mean coming face

00:22:15.860 --> 00:22:19.248 align:middle line:84%
to face with some things that
are very difficult because we

00:22:19.248 --> 00:22:20.540 align:middle line:90%
may not be who we think we are.

00:22:20.540 --> 00:22:23.850 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And always building
this, in intelligence terms,

00:22:23.850 --> 00:22:24.650 align:middle line:90%
this legend--

00:22:24.650 --> 00:22:24.920 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHS]

00:22:24.920 --> 00:22:26.087 align:middle line:90%
>>HOROWITZ: Mhm, yes, right.

00:22:26.087 --> 00:22:29.030 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: --this legend of
who we are and then going

00:22:29.030 --> 00:22:31.538 align:middle line:84%
on to social media and
putting our sizzle reel up--

00:22:31.538 --> 00:22:32.580 align:middle line:90%
>>HOROWITZ: Right, right.

00:22:32.580 --> 00:22:33.380 align:middle line:90%
That's right.

00:22:33.380 --> 00:22:35.930 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: --about how perfect
our lives are and our teeth

00:22:35.930 --> 00:22:36.500 align:middle line:90%
and everything--

00:22:36.500 --> 00:22:37.310 align:middle line:90%
>>HOROWITZ: Yeah, yeah.

00:22:37.310 --> 00:22:38.477 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: --everything else.

00:22:38.477 --> 00:22:41.480 align:middle line:84%
And the reality
is, in the journey

00:22:41.480 --> 00:22:47.780 align:middle line:84%
of coming to know thyself,
what you say is so true.

00:22:47.780 --> 00:22:50.840 align:middle line:84%
And one of the ways
it's overlooked

00:22:50.840 --> 00:22:54.110 align:middle line:84%
is by watching our
own reactions to life

00:22:54.110 --> 00:22:57.472 align:middle line:84%
and stopping to reflect on,
jeez, where'd that come from?

00:22:57.472 --> 00:22:59.430 align:middle line:84%
And these are the parts
we may not want to own.

00:22:59.430 --> 00:23:01.520 align:middle line:84%
These are the parts that
may not be flattering.

00:23:01.520 --> 00:23:05.000 align:middle line:84%
But the subconscious,
which is with us always,

00:23:05.000 --> 00:23:07.910 align:middle line:84%
from lifetime to lifetime--
the embedded information

00:23:07.910 --> 00:23:11.090 align:middle line:84%
of everything our soul has
ever been through is there--

00:23:11.090 --> 00:23:14.390 align:middle line:84%
to not stop and even take
time to say, why am I

00:23:14.390 --> 00:23:18.560 align:middle line:84%
reacting to this in this way,
to this in this way, that to me

00:23:18.560 --> 00:23:22.100 align:middle line:84%
seems to be a really
good beginning place

00:23:22.100 --> 00:23:24.650 align:middle line:84%
at knowing thyself in
more dimensions than just

00:23:24.650 --> 00:23:25.550 align:middle line:90%
the sizzle reel.

00:23:25.550 --> 00:23:26.870 align:middle line:90%
>>HOROWITZ: Yes, yes.

00:23:26.870 --> 00:23:30.980 align:middle line:84%
And I think that we're
divorced from the things that

00:23:30.980 --> 00:23:33.170 align:middle line:84%
make ourselves happy,
as well, when we're not

00:23:33.170 --> 00:23:34.280 align:middle line:90%
able to ask this question.

00:23:34.280 --> 00:23:35.010 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:23:35.010 --> 00:23:36.593 align:middle line:84%
>>HOROWITZ: And I
would say to people,

00:23:36.593 --> 00:23:39.800 align:middle line:84%
even if it doesn't seem
like you can act on it,

00:23:39.800 --> 00:23:42.500 align:middle line:84%
don't fall into the
tragedy of not knowing.

00:23:42.500 --> 00:23:44.960 align:middle line:84%
Make a note of things
that you'd like

00:23:44.960 --> 00:23:47.250 align:middle line:84%
to be doing at
different times of day.

00:23:47.250 --> 00:23:49.820 align:middle line:84%
And even if you say, well,
that's futile because I can't

00:23:49.820 --> 00:23:52.070 align:middle line:90%
act on it, it doesn't matter.

00:23:52.070 --> 00:23:55.220 align:middle line:84%
There are strange connections
and tendrils in life, you know?

00:23:55.220 --> 00:23:58.640 align:middle line:84%
And if you can identify
something with clarity,

00:23:58.640 --> 00:24:01.370 align:middle line:84%
you might suddenly find yourself
in proximity to it in ways

00:24:01.370 --> 00:24:02.828 align:middle line:84%
that you never
would have expected.

00:24:02.828 --> 00:24:05.600 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Well, and this gets
into your whole body of work,

00:24:05.600 --> 00:24:11.100 align:middle line:84%
that it's often reduced to
the idea of law of attraction,

00:24:11.100 --> 00:24:12.875 align:middle line:90%
which is reduced even further.

00:24:12.875 --> 00:24:17.240 align:middle line:84%
But the reality is it's that
discovery, that discovery

00:24:17.240 --> 00:24:18.995 align:middle line:84%
point, of where,
tell me the secret.

00:24:18.995 --> 00:24:20.288 align:middle line:90%
This is what I really want.

00:24:20.288 --> 00:24:21.330 align:middle line:90%
>>HOROWITZ: It's amazing.

00:24:21.330 --> 00:24:24.110 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: It's amazing, the
forces that come into motion.

00:24:24.110 --> 00:24:27.080 align:middle line:84%
There is a very famous
saying by Goethe around that.

00:24:27.080 --> 00:24:30.430 align:middle line:84%
Everything will sweep in
to lift you and help you

00:24:30.430 --> 00:24:33.420 align:middle line:84%
once you're really clear on
what you want and that passion.

00:24:33.420 --> 00:24:34.220 align:middle line:90%
>>HOROWITZ: Yes.

00:24:34.220 --> 00:24:36.595 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And we don't have
faith in Life, with a capital

00:24:36.595 --> 00:24:38.000 align:middle line:90%
"L," enough to provide for us.

00:24:38.000 --> 00:24:38.800 align:middle line:90%
>>HOROWITZ: Right.

00:24:38.800 --> 00:24:40.970 align:middle line:10%
Goethe made the
observation that what

00:24:40.970 --> 00:24:42.920 align:middle line:10%
you wish for when
you're very, very young

00:24:42.920 --> 00:24:45.230 align:middle line:10%
comes upon you in
waves when you're old.

00:24:45.230 --> 00:24:46.030 align:middle line:90%
So be careful.

00:24:46.030 --> 00:24:47.655 align:middle line:84%
And a lot of people
hear that, and they

00:24:47.655 --> 00:24:50.210 align:middle line:84%
want to argue with it because
they say, well, wait a minute.

00:24:50.210 --> 00:24:51.810 align:middle line:84%
I have all these
unfulfilled dreams.

00:24:51.810 --> 00:24:53.310 align:middle line:10%
I haven't experienced
all the things

00:24:53.310 --> 00:24:54.860 align:middle line:10%
I wanted when I was very young.

00:24:54.860 --> 00:24:57.410 align:middle line:84%
And again, I counsel
people, take time

00:24:57.410 --> 00:24:59.820 align:middle line:84%
to turn back the
pages of your life.

00:24:59.820 --> 00:25:04.040 align:middle line:10%
Think of your earliest
fantasies from the earliest

00:25:04.040 --> 00:25:06.500 align:middle line:10%
period from which we're
cognizant, maybe age three,

00:25:06.500 --> 00:25:07.610 align:middle line:10%
maybe age four.

00:25:07.610 --> 00:25:09.590 align:middle line:84%
And see if you don't
detect a symmetry.

00:25:09.590 --> 00:25:10.760 align:middle line:90%
It can be uncanny.

00:25:10.760 --> 00:25:12.200 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Absolutely.

00:25:12.200 --> 00:25:15.260 align:middle line:84%
And if you do take the time
to go back, even if it's

00:25:15.260 --> 00:25:18.470 align:middle line:84%
something, well, I wanted to
be a singer when I was little,

00:25:18.470 --> 00:25:20.390 align:middle line:90%
you can sing in the shower.

00:25:20.390 --> 00:25:23.270 align:middle line:84%
But if you stop singing
altogether, that's a problem.

00:25:23.270 --> 00:25:25.490 align:middle line:10%
>>HOROWITZ: And I
often tell people--

00:25:25.490 --> 00:25:28.430 align:middle line:10%
we ask ourselves the question,
is this goal realistic?

00:25:28.430 --> 00:25:31.340 align:middle line:10%
If you can take certain
steps in its direction,

00:25:31.340 --> 00:25:33.920 align:middle line:10%
however nascent and
however incremental

00:25:33.920 --> 00:25:35.640 align:middle line:10%
they are, then it's realistic.

00:25:35.640 --> 00:25:36.440 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: It is.

00:25:36.440 --> 00:25:38.480 align:middle line:84%
>>HOROWITZ: Certain
concrete steps.

00:25:38.480 --> 00:25:41.036 align:middle line:90%
And watch for those, as well.

00:25:41.036 --> 00:25:43.790 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: I couldn't agree
with your underscoring

00:25:43.790 --> 00:25:44.660 align:middle line:90%
this issue more.

00:25:44.660 --> 00:25:47.870 align:middle line:84%
If that's one thing people take
away from this conversation,

00:25:47.870 --> 00:25:50.210 align:middle line:84%
really take the time
to stop and look

00:25:50.210 --> 00:25:54.170 align:middle line:84%
at what you want, how you
react, where it's coming from.

00:25:54.170 --> 00:25:56.630 align:middle line:84%
Is there something similar
that's happened in the past

00:25:56.630 --> 00:25:59.650 align:middle line:84%
that's inspired this
in you or that's

00:25:59.650 --> 00:26:02.323 align:middle line:84%
brought forth the same
feeling, even if it

00:26:02.323 --> 00:26:03.490 align:middle line:90%
can be a little challenging?

00:26:03.490 --> 00:26:05.830 align:middle line:10%
>>HOROWITZ: And I always
like to tell people,

00:26:05.830 --> 00:26:08.200 align:middle line:10%
I did not write my
first book, which

00:26:08.200 --> 00:26:11.620 align:middle line:10%
was "Occult America," until I
was well over the age of 40.

00:26:11.620 --> 00:26:14.540 align:middle line:10%
I think I was probably about
43 at the time it came out.

00:26:14.540 --> 00:26:16.390 align:middle line:10%
And I always like to
remind people of that

00:26:16.390 --> 00:26:20.500 align:middle line:10%
because I was in what would
be considered middle age when

00:26:20.500 --> 00:26:22.120 align:middle line:10%
"Occult America" came out.

00:26:22.120 --> 00:26:27.070 align:middle line:10%
And I had all but given up on
the dream of being an author,

00:26:27.070 --> 00:26:29.290 align:middle line:10%
of being an historian, of
being a public speaker.

00:26:29.290 --> 00:26:31.990 align:middle line:10%
And that dream came
to me in middle age.

00:26:31.990 --> 00:26:33.990 align:middle line:10%
And I just always like
to remind people of that.

00:26:33.990 --> 00:26:35.740 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: I think
that's really important.

00:26:35.740 --> 00:26:37.810 align:middle line:84%
So the whole thing about
the unexamined life

00:26:37.810 --> 00:26:40.510 align:middle line:84%
is not worth living, well, some
people examine it to death.

00:26:40.510 --> 00:26:41.310 align:middle line:90%
Come on.

00:26:41.310 --> 00:26:42.460 align:middle line:90%
It's just boring.

00:26:42.460 --> 00:26:46.212 align:middle line:84%
Sitting and constantly
obsessing over yourself,

00:26:46.212 --> 00:26:47.920 align:middle line:84%
that's not what we're
talking about here.

00:26:47.920 --> 00:26:50.740 align:middle line:84%
We're talking about genuine, in
the quiet of night reflection.

00:26:50.740 --> 00:26:51.595 align:middle line:90%
>>HOROWITZ: Yes.

00:26:51.595 --> 00:26:53.470 align:middle line:10%
And that reflection can
also be very private.

00:26:53.470 --> 00:26:55.137 align:middle line:10%
You don't have to
share it with anybody.

00:26:55.137 --> 00:26:57.458 align:middle line:10%
And it may be good not to
share it in a certain sense.

00:26:57.458 --> 00:26:58.500 align:middle line:10%
There's power in silence.

00:26:58.500 --> 00:26:59.000 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:26:59.000 --> 00:27:00.610 align:middle line:84%
So let's get to
some of the deities.

00:27:00.610 --> 00:27:02.830 align:middle line:84%
We've knocked off a
couple of the main axioms.

00:27:02.830 --> 00:27:04.960 align:middle line:84%
Let's get to some of
the deities because you

00:27:04.960 --> 00:27:07.150 align:middle line:84%
talk in the book
about how we can

00:27:07.150 --> 00:27:11.620 align:middle line:84%
go into relationship with what
were some of the famous deities

00:27:11.620 --> 00:27:13.790 align:middle line:90%
or gods of the ages.

00:27:13.790 --> 00:27:16.150 align:middle line:84%
And if you look at it
through the Hermetic lens,

00:27:16.150 --> 00:27:17.875 align:middle line:84%
these gods represent
the heavens.

00:27:17.875 --> 00:27:19.000 align:middle line:90%
They represent the planets.

00:27:19.000 --> 00:27:19.660 align:middle line:90%
>>HOROWITZ: Yes.

00:27:19.660 --> 00:27:21.827 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And this is where
the "as above, so below"

00:27:21.827 --> 00:27:23.630 align:middle line:90%
really starts coming into play.

00:27:23.630 --> 00:27:26.825 align:middle line:84%
So talk about that for a little
bit before we get into Set--

00:27:26.825 --> 00:27:27.700 align:middle line:90%
>>HOROWITZ: Oh, yeah.

00:27:27.700 --> 00:27:29.117 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: --the bad boy.

00:27:29.117 --> 00:27:30.980 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHTER]

00:27:30.980 --> 00:27:34.060 align:middle line:84%
>>HOROWITZ: The ancients had
a much deeper relationship

00:27:34.060 --> 00:27:35.620 align:middle line:90%
with nature than we do.

00:27:35.620 --> 00:27:40.150 align:middle line:84%
And of course, likewise, death
was a more palpable presence.

00:27:40.150 --> 00:27:41.380 align:middle line:90%
Life was more precarious.

00:27:41.380 --> 00:27:43.720 align:middle line:10%
They lived and died by
the seasons, by the hunt,

00:27:43.720 --> 00:27:45.340 align:middle line:10%
by the cycles of planting.

00:27:45.340 --> 00:27:48.550 align:middle line:84%
They were tapped into nature
with a certain urgency in ways

00:27:48.550 --> 00:27:49.460 align:middle line:90%
that we are not.

00:27:49.460 --> 00:27:52.300 align:middle line:84%
And I think that they were
able to identify energies

00:27:52.300 --> 00:27:53.500 align:middle line:90%
within nature.

00:27:53.500 --> 00:27:55.270 align:middle line:90%
They personified these energies.

00:27:55.270 --> 00:27:59.320 align:middle line:84%
They gave them names like
Minerva or Set or Jupiter.

00:27:59.320 --> 00:28:03.820 align:middle line:84%
And they sought relationships
with these energies or deities.

00:28:03.820 --> 00:28:07.090 align:middle line:84%
And this was true for
thousands and thousands

00:28:07.090 --> 00:28:08.560 align:middle line:90%
of years in antiquity.

00:28:08.560 --> 00:28:10.180 align:middle line:84%
And today we think
of ourselves here

00:28:10.180 --> 00:28:13.480 align:middle line:84%
in the West as living within
a monotheistic society.

00:28:13.480 --> 00:28:16.030 align:middle line:84%
But the fact is
that has represented

00:28:16.030 --> 00:28:19.390 align:middle line:84%
just a little glacial
peak of human history.

00:28:19.390 --> 00:28:22.720 align:middle line:10%
The broader facts
of human history

00:28:22.720 --> 00:28:25.120 align:middle line:10%
have really been this
very rich, different,

00:28:25.120 --> 00:28:28.180 align:middle line:10%
diversified relationships
that our ancestors had

00:28:28.180 --> 00:28:30.730 align:middle line:10%
with different deities with
whom they felt an affinity

00:28:30.730 --> 00:28:32.110 align:middle line:10%
and they sought relationships.

00:28:32.110 --> 00:28:34.480 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Well, if
you go to astrology,

00:28:34.480 --> 00:28:37.300 align:middle line:84%
if you take into account the
notion that many of these

00:28:37.300 --> 00:28:39.650 align:middle line:84%
deities were aligned with
very specific planets--

00:28:39.650 --> 00:28:40.450 align:middle line:90%
>>HOROWITZ: Yes.

00:28:40.450 --> 00:28:42.730 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: --and you
take into account

00:28:42.730 --> 00:28:45.400 align:middle line:84%
the astrological
effects on our lives,

00:28:45.400 --> 00:28:48.190 align:middle line:84%
wouldn't it make sense that
people would feel a connection

00:28:48.190 --> 00:28:50.380 align:middle line:84%
with these particular
entities that

00:28:50.380 --> 00:28:53.740 align:middle line:84%
are representing these very
planets that we're part of?

00:28:53.740 --> 00:28:55.780 align:middle line:84%
The moving and the energies
emanating from them,

00:28:55.780 --> 00:28:57.050 align:middle line:90%
we're always a part of.

00:28:57.050 --> 00:28:57.340 align:middle line:90%
>>HOROWITZ: Yes.

00:28:57.340 --> 00:28:59.507 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And so they had
not just Earth connection.

00:28:59.507 --> 00:29:01.660 align:middle line:84%
But they had a sense of
the cosmos and a connection

00:29:01.660 --> 00:29:03.787 align:middle line:90%
to the cosmos we don't have.

00:29:03.787 --> 00:29:04.870 align:middle line:90%
>>HOROWITZ: We don't have.

00:29:04.870 --> 00:29:08.810 align:middle line:10%
And that really is one of the
areas that "as above, so below"

00:29:08.810 --> 00:29:09.610 align:middle line:10%
shines a light.

00:29:09.610 --> 00:29:11.260 align:middle line:84%
The greater Hermetic
dictum tells us

00:29:11.260 --> 00:29:14.050 align:middle line:84%
that you as an
individual are intimately

00:29:14.050 --> 00:29:15.580 align:middle line:90%
connected to the cosmos.

00:29:15.580 --> 00:29:18.350 align:middle line:10%
Your psyche is intimately
connected to the cosmos.

00:29:18.350 --> 00:29:20.090 align:middle line:10%
It's all one thing.

00:29:20.090 --> 00:29:22.990 align:middle line:10%
And so when you hear an
expression like "as above,

00:29:22.990 --> 00:29:25.960 align:middle line:10%
so below," it's about
the correspondences

00:29:25.960 --> 00:29:28.270 align:middle line:10%
that make up the whole of life.

00:29:28.270 --> 00:29:30.330 align:middle line:84%
And these correspondences,
they're endless.

00:29:30.330 --> 00:29:31.130 align:middle line:90%
They're everywhere.

00:29:31.130 --> 00:29:31.540 align:middle line:90%
They're omnipresent.

00:29:31.540 --> 00:29:33.640 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: You can't separate
yourself through them.

00:29:33.640 --> 00:29:34.440 align:middle line:90%
>>HOROWITZ: Yeah.

00:29:34.440 --> 00:29:36.430 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And so
now this gets us

00:29:36.430 --> 00:29:38.110 align:middle line:90%
to-- you named a few entities.

00:29:38.110 --> 00:29:39.650 align:middle line:84%
And you talk about
Set in your book.

00:29:39.650 --> 00:29:40.450 align:middle line:90%
>>HOROWITZ: Yes.

00:29:40.450 --> 00:29:42.283 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And everyone
thinks, or the people

00:29:42.283 --> 00:29:45.940 align:middle line:84%
who have studied
Egyptian history at all

00:29:45.940 --> 00:29:48.320 align:middle line:90%
would say, Set, oh, my God.

00:29:48.320 --> 00:29:50.590 align:middle line:90%
That is one nasty guy.

00:29:50.590 --> 00:29:53.410 align:middle line:84%
That's a bad boy
of all of the gods.

00:29:53.410 --> 00:29:54.550 align:middle line:90%
And you say, no.

00:29:54.550 --> 00:29:57.110 align:middle line:84%
You have a particular
respect for Set.

00:29:57.110 --> 00:30:01.420 align:middle line:84%
So let's talk about who Set
is historically and then

00:30:01.420 --> 00:30:05.000 align:middle line:84%
his relationship and the big
drama with Osiris, Isis, et

00:30:05.000 --> 00:30:05.800 align:middle line:90%
cetera.

00:30:05.800 --> 00:30:06.600 align:middle line:10%
>>HOROWITZ: Right.

00:30:06.600 --> 00:30:10.000 align:middle line:10%
Well, Set, within the
Egyptian lexicon of gods,

00:30:10.000 --> 00:30:12.280 align:middle line:10%
is the God of Desert,
the God of Storms.

00:30:12.280 --> 00:30:14.200 align:middle line:10%
There's a fierceness about Set.

00:30:14.200 --> 00:30:18.280 align:middle line:10%
And Set, depending on which
storyline you're reading from,

00:30:18.280 --> 00:30:22.690 align:middle line:10%
was either brother to or
uncle to the God Horus, who

00:30:22.690 --> 00:30:24.310 align:middle line:10%
is kind of a savior figure.

00:30:24.310 --> 00:30:28.150 align:middle line:10%
And Set got into a dispute
with Horus' father,

00:30:28.150 --> 00:30:29.740 align:middle line:10%
Osiris, and dismembered him.

00:30:29.740 --> 00:30:31.690 align:middle line:10%
And Horus reassembled him.

00:30:31.690 --> 00:30:34.870 align:middle line:10%
And so Set, for those
reasons, is sometimes

00:30:34.870 --> 00:30:38.150 align:middle line:10%
regarded as a kind of underworld
figure, like a satanic figure.

00:30:38.150 --> 00:30:40.730 align:middle line:10%
But as you've
alluded, Set is also--

00:30:40.730 --> 00:30:41.530 align:middle line:10%
he's the rebel.

00:30:41.530 --> 00:30:42.820 align:middle line:90%
He's the usurper.

00:30:42.820 --> 00:30:43.990 align:middle line:90%
He's the revolutionary.

00:30:43.990 --> 00:30:45.400 align:middle line:90%
He shakes things up.

00:30:45.400 --> 00:30:48.340 align:middle line:84%
He keeps things from
getting staid and calcified

00:30:48.340 --> 00:30:50.080 align:middle line:90%
and just cemented in place.

00:30:50.080 --> 00:30:52.660 align:middle line:10%
And when we talk about
Egyptian civilization,

00:30:52.660 --> 00:30:54.730 align:middle line:10%
as we've been
alluding, it went on

00:30:54.730 --> 00:30:57.100 align:middle line:10%
for thousands and
thousands of years.

00:30:57.100 --> 00:30:59.810 align:middle line:84%
People didn't just have one
attitude and one outlook

00:30:59.810 --> 00:31:01.557 align:middle line:90%
for that arc of history.

00:31:01.557 --> 00:31:03.140 align:middle line:84%
They changed their
minds about things.

00:31:03.140 --> 00:31:05.480 align:middle line:84%
They had different outlooks,
different points of view.

00:31:05.480 --> 00:31:07.280 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Lots of different
politics intervened.

00:31:07.280 --> 00:31:07.910 align:middle line:90%
>>HOROWITZ: Different politics.

00:31:07.910 --> 00:31:10.180 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Priestly class
rose, fell, rose, fell--

00:31:10.180 --> 00:31:10.490 align:middle line:90%
>>HOROWITZ: Absolutely.

00:31:10.490 --> 00:31:11.030 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: --so forth.

00:31:11.030 --> 00:31:13.613 align:middle line:84%
>>HOROWITZ: I saw a bas relief
in the Egyptian National Museum

00:31:13.613 --> 00:31:17.040 align:middle line:84%
in Cairo that showed Set and
Horus in an embrace basically.

00:31:17.040 --> 00:31:17.840 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:31:17.840 --> 00:31:20.095 align:middle line:84%
>>HOROWITZ: And it was so
fascinating and so wonderful

00:31:20.095 --> 00:31:21.470 align:middle line:84%
because it's
telling you that you

00:31:21.470 --> 00:31:23.030 align:middle line:90%
need both sides of yourself.

00:31:23.030 --> 00:31:26.000 align:middle line:84%
There's the more domestic,
peacemaking side, which

00:31:26.000 --> 00:31:27.700 align:middle line:90%
might be considered Horus.

00:31:27.700 --> 00:31:30.200 align:middle line:84%
And then there's the side that
just needs to shake things up

00:31:30.200 --> 00:31:32.670 align:middle line:84%
and to philosophize
with a sledgehammer.

00:31:32.670 --> 00:31:33.470 align:middle line:90%
And that's Set.

00:31:33.470 --> 00:31:34.940 align:middle line:90%
And they can both be joined.

00:31:34.940 --> 00:31:38.746 align:middle line:84%
And according to "as above, so
below," they must be joined.

00:31:38.746 --> 00:31:39.660 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:31:39.660 --> 00:31:41.550 align:middle line:84%
And so this brings
me to this thought

00:31:41.550 --> 00:31:44.760 align:middle line:84%
I've had for quite some time
in studying all of this, right?

00:31:44.760 --> 00:31:47.760 align:middle line:84%
And, again, "as
above, so below," and

00:31:47.760 --> 00:31:49.410 align:middle line:84%
let's take it even
further, right?

00:31:49.410 --> 00:31:56.860 align:middle line:84%
And I have, in my own
mind, put together an idea

00:31:56.860 --> 00:32:00.650 align:middle line:90%
that Osiris is the logos--

00:32:00.650 --> 00:32:01.450 align:middle line:90%
>>HOROWITZ: Mhm.

00:32:01.450 --> 00:32:05.560 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: --that Isis
is prima materia--

00:32:05.560 --> 00:32:07.900 align:middle line:84%
and you can explain what
those terms mean for people--

00:32:07.900 --> 00:32:11.620 align:middle line:84%
and that their
offspring is Horus.

00:32:11.620 --> 00:32:15.190 align:middle line:84%
So now-- and we'll go back and
reconstruct that for people--

00:32:15.190 --> 00:32:20.230 align:middle line:84%
but as a potential, then
bringing Set into it

00:32:20.230 --> 00:32:26.470 align:middle line:84%
becomes very interesting because
of the logos impregnates prima

00:32:26.470 --> 00:32:29.260 align:middle line:84%
materia, the baseline
matter that all things

00:32:29.260 --> 00:32:30.455 align:middle line:90%
can create from.

00:32:30.455 --> 00:32:31.255 align:middle line:90%
>>HOROWITZ: Right.

00:32:31.255 --> 00:32:33.640 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: What happens
when you put Set in there?

00:32:33.640 --> 00:32:35.812 align:middle line:84%
Set's role becomes
something very interesting.

00:32:35.812 --> 00:32:37.270 align:middle line:84%
>>HOROWITZ: That's
beautifully put.

00:32:37.270 --> 00:32:39.910 align:middle line:10%
Set, I think, is the
snake in the garden.

00:32:39.910 --> 00:32:42.610 align:middle line:10%
Set is the one who intrudes
into paradise and says,

00:32:42.610 --> 00:32:43.450 align:middle line:10%
you know what?

00:32:43.450 --> 00:32:46.750 align:middle line:84%
You're not going to be fully
human unless there's friction.

00:32:46.750 --> 00:32:48.520 align:middle line:10%
This might all be wonderful.

00:32:48.520 --> 00:32:50.590 align:middle line:10%
But we don't get
anywhere without heat.

00:32:50.590 --> 00:32:52.630 align:middle line:10%
We don't get buildings
without cutting stone.

00:32:52.630 --> 00:32:55.240 align:middle line:10%
We don't get fire
without burning sticks.

00:32:55.240 --> 00:32:59.107 align:middle line:10%
We don't grow ourselves
unless there is friction,

00:32:59.107 --> 00:33:00.940 align:middle line:10%
unless there's a need
to overcome something.

00:33:00.940 --> 00:33:03.070 align:middle line:84%
Otherwise we remain
emotional children.

00:33:03.070 --> 00:33:05.500 align:middle line:84%
So you have Isis, kind
of the Earth mother.

00:33:05.500 --> 00:33:08.170 align:middle line:84%
Or in Christian terms you
might use the term Mary.

00:33:08.170 --> 00:33:11.140 align:middle line:10%
And then you have Horus, who
might be seen as a savior

00:33:11.140 --> 00:33:13.300 align:middle line:10%
figure, like a Christ
figure, but who

00:33:13.300 --> 00:33:16.960 align:middle line:10%
is also the
manifestation of creation

00:33:16.960 --> 00:33:19.330 align:middle line:10%
here on Earth, the
logos, the word spoken,

00:33:19.330 --> 00:33:20.230 align:middle line:10%
the word made flesh.

00:33:20.230 --> 00:33:20.650 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Made flesh.

00:33:20.650 --> 00:33:22.000 align:middle line:90%
>>HOROWITZ: And here comes Set.

00:33:22.000 --> 00:33:23.020 align:middle line:90%
Where does he fit in?

00:33:23.020 --> 00:33:23.920 align:middle line:90%
He's the intruder.

00:33:23.920 --> 00:33:25.060 align:middle line:90%
He's the usurper.

00:33:25.060 --> 00:33:26.170 align:middle line:90%
He upends things.

00:33:26.170 --> 00:33:28.900 align:middle line:10%
But again, if we are in
conditions where we're not

00:33:28.900 --> 00:33:30.520 align:middle line:10%
challenged, we stagnate.

00:33:30.520 --> 00:33:31.930 align:middle line:90%
He comes to challenge.

00:33:31.930 --> 00:33:33.730 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: That's
what I was thinking

00:33:33.730 --> 00:33:36.760 align:middle line:84%
because if there is
first the word or first

00:33:36.760 --> 00:33:38.410 align:middle line:84%
the concept, which
we're doing-- we're

00:33:38.410 --> 00:33:40.960 align:middle line:84%
in this process of creation
every day with every thought.

00:33:40.960 --> 00:33:43.270 align:middle line:84%
So this is "as the
below" part, right?

00:33:43.270 --> 00:33:45.910 align:middle line:84%
But if you're looking at it
from the very largest sense,

00:33:45.910 --> 00:33:48.250 align:middle line:84%
first is the word
or the thought that

00:33:48.250 --> 00:33:53.380 align:middle line:84%
impregnates the prima
materia to then create

00:33:53.380 --> 00:33:55.900 align:middle line:84%
into the flesh
this manifestation.

00:33:55.900 --> 00:33:59.380 align:middle line:84%
What would be the thing
inspiring the creation

00:33:59.380 --> 00:34:01.030 align:middle line:90%
or thought to begin with?

00:34:01.030 --> 00:34:05.110 align:middle line:84%
Because, as you say, you
can't have stagnation.

00:34:05.110 --> 00:34:06.730 align:middle line:84%
Necessity is the
mother of invention.

00:34:06.730 --> 00:34:10.330 align:middle line:84%
You have to have
something driving all

00:34:10.330 --> 00:34:12.190 align:middle line:90%
of the cosmos, all of nature.

00:34:12.190 --> 00:34:15.100 align:middle line:84%
All of the greatest creative
minds in the universe

00:34:15.100 --> 00:34:18.040 align:middle line:84%
have to be moving forward
because there's something

00:34:18.040 --> 00:34:20.170 align:middle line:90%
to challenge us forward--

00:34:20.170 --> 00:34:21.219 align:middle line:90%
>>HOROWITZ: Yes.

00:34:21.219 --> 00:34:26.420 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: --to put some
new potential creation

00:34:26.420 --> 00:34:29.870 align:middle line:84%
in the mind of the
creator, whether it be us

00:34:29.870 --> 00:34:31.895 align:middle line:84%
or whether it be
the great creators.

00:34:31.895 --> 00:34:33.170 align:middle line:90%
>>HOROWITZ: Mhm, mhm, yes.

00:34:33.170 --> 00:34:36.500 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And so seeing it that
way, the pebble in the shoe

00:34:36.500 --> 00:34:37.330 align:middle line:90%
would be Set.

00:34:37.330 --> 00:34:39.739 align:middle line:10%
>>HOROWITZ:
Absolutely, absolutely.

00:34:39.739 --> 00:34:43.190 align:middle line:10%
I mean, if things
were too easy for us,

00:34:43.190 --> 00:34:47.820 align:middle line:10%
we would remain physically and
emotionally and intellectually

00:34:47.820 --> 00:34:48.620 align:middle line:10%
stagnant.

00:34:48.620 --> 00:34:49.550 align:middle line:90%
We'd be children.

00:34:49.550 --> 00:34:51.650 align:middle line:90%
We wouldn't be humanity.

00:34:51.650 --> 00:34:56.000 align:middle line:10%
If humanity hadn't been expelled
from the garden, so to speak,

00:34:56.000 --> 00:34:57.260 align:middle line:10%
how would we know ourselves?

00:34:57.260 --> 00:34:58.520 align:middle line:10%
What would there be to know?

00:34:58.520 --> 00:35:00.200 align:middle line:84%
There would be no
challenges in life.

00:35:00.200 --> 00:35:00.920 align:middle line:84%
There would be no
differentiated--

00:35:00.920 --> 00:35:01.490 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: There'd
be no contrast.

00:35:01.490 --> 00:35:02.365 align:middle line:90%
>>HOROWITZ: --psyche.

00:35:02.365 --> 00:35:03.800 align:middle line:90%
Right, there'd be no contrast.

00:35:03.800 --> 00:35:06.200 align:middle line:90%
Set provides the contrast.

00:35:06.200 --> 00:35:08.990 align:middle line:84%
That's why he was the God of
Storms, the God of the Desert.

00:35:08.990 --> 00:35:11.150 align:middle line:84%
You know, he was
the great usurper.

00:35:11.150 --> 00:35:12.690 align:middle line:90%
He shook things up.

00:35:12.690 --> 00:35:15.680 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So I think it's fair
to say we should not be afraid

00:35:15.680 --> 00:35:18.500 align:middle line:84%
when we hear or see the
image of or hear the word

00:35:18.500 --> 00:35:20.960 align:middle line:84%
"Set" any longer, that
we're going directly

00:35:20.960 --> 00:35:23.900 align:middle line:84%
to the underworld because that's
just another concept, as well,

00:35:23.900 --> 00:35:24.260 align:middle line:90%
OK?

00:35:24.260 --> 00:35:25.070 align:middle line:84%
>>HOROWITZ: Yes, and
it's all connected.

00:35:25.070 --> 00:35:26.240 align:middle line:84%
"As above, so below,"
it's one life.

00:35:26.240 --> 00:35:27.005 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And it's
all connected.

00:35:27.005 --> 00:35:27.260 align:middle line:90%
>>HOROWITZ: Yeah.

00:35:27.260 --> 00:35:29.570 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Anyway, I wanted
to talk with you about that

00:35:29.570 --> 00:35:32.780 align:middle line:84%
because you're the only one
that really, I've read anyway,

00:35:32.780 --> 00:35:34.400 align:middle line:90%
that sets Set up in this way.

00:35:34.400 --> 00:35:35.930 align:middle line:84%
And it's something
I think we need

00:35:35.930 --> 00:35:37.885 align:middle line:84%
to look at in ourselves
even right now

00:35:37.885 --> 00:35:39.260 align:middle line:84%
in this period of
modern history.

00:35:39.260 --> 00:35:42.200 align:middle line:84%
We've got some major challenges
that we're facing right now.

00:35:42.200 --> 00:35:43.520 align:middle line:90%
And I want to go into that.

00:35:43.520 --> 00:35:50.570 align:middle line:84%
Ethics has become something that
you can call a very fluid state

00:35:50.570 --> 00:35:51.410 align:middle line:90%
right now.

00:35:51.410 --> 00:35:56.360 align:middle line:84%
And there's always
been manipulation

00:35:56.360 --> 00:35:59.900 align:middle line:84%
from on high, every kind of on
high, whether it's institutions

00:35:59.900 --> 00:36:02.040 align:middle line:84%
or whether it's
churches, so forth.

00:36:02.040 --> 00:36:04.748 align:middle line:84%
But now we're looking at
something entirely different.

00:36:04.748 --> 00:36:06.290 align:middle line:84%
People still were
playing essentially

00:36:06.290 --> 00:36:09.680 align:middle line:90%
by agreed-upon rules of society.

00:36:09.680 --> 00:36:11.660 align:middle line:90%
That's coming unhinged now.

00:36:11.660 --> 00:36:14.180 align:middle line:84%
We have this extreme
bifurcation of consciousness

00:36:14.180 --> 00:36:16.730 align:middle line:84%
that I was quite depressed
over for several months.

00:36:16.730 --> 00:36:18.320 align:middle line:90%
I'm reconciling with it now.

00:36:18.320 --> 00:36:19.850 align:middle line:90%
It is what it is.

00:36:19.850 --> 00:36:22.100 align:middle line:90%
But let's talk about ethics.

00:36:22.100 --> 00:36:23.540 align:middle line:90%
And some of the old--

00:36:23.540 --> 00:36:27.112 align:middle line:84%
one of your favorite
books is "The Art of War."

00:36:27.112 --> 00:36:28.070 align:middle line:90%
>>HOROWITZ: Yeah, yeah.

00:36:28.070 --> 00:36:30.860 align:middle line:10%
>>REGINA: And so I'm looking
at this because this is where

00:36:30.860 --> 00:36:35.180 align:middle line:10%
ethics and our idea of how we
contend with life kind of come

00:36:35.180 --> 00:36:37.700 align:middle line:10%
up in stark contrast--

00:36:37.700 --> 00:36:41.810 align:middle line:10%
the art of war versus healing
versus revelation of truth

00:36:41.810 --> 00:36:44.040 align:middle line:10%
versus gaining
advantage over someone.

00:36:44.040 --> 00:36:46.400 align:middle line:84%
How do you feel something
like "The Art of War"

00:36:46.400 --> 00:36:49.333 align:middle line:90%
factors into this world today?

00:36:49.333 --> 00:36:50.750 align:middle line:84%
>>HOROWITZ: Well,
"The Art of War"

00:36:50.750 --> 00:36:52.340 align:middle line:90%
is an ancient Chinese work.

00:36:52.340 --> 00:36:54.320 align:middle line:84%
I call it an ancient
Chinese ethical work.

00:36:54.320 --> 00:36:56.160 align:middle line:90%
And it is about warfare.

00:36:56.160 --> 00:36:58.310 align:middle line:84%
It is about prevailing
over your adversary.

00:36:58.310 --> 00:37:01.580 align:middle line:84%
And it is about how
to win armed conflict.

00:37:01.580 --> 00:37:03.830 align:middle line:84%
It's not some cute,
perfumed title.

00:37:03.830 --> 00:37:04.040 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Yeah,
it's not new age.

00:37:04.040 --> 00:37:05.240 align:middle line:84%
>>HOROWITZ: It's
very literal, right.

00:37:05.240 --> 00:37:06.040 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHTER]

00:37:06.040 --> 00:37:09.530 align:middle line:10%
But at the same time, it's
also a book, a very wise book,

00:37:09.530 --> 00:37:12.860 align:middle line:10%
that understands that
conflict and friction are

00:37:12.860 --> 00:37:14.630 align:middle line:10%
going to be part of life.

00:37:14.630 --> 00:37:16.550 align:middle line:10%
There's never been an
epoch of human history

00:37:16.550 --> 00:37:18.080 align:middle line:10%
in which there were not.

00:37:18.080 --> 00:37:20.840 align:middle line:10%
And accepting that
fact for what it

00:37:20.840 --> 00:37:23.840 align:middle line:10%
is, if there are times
you need to prevail

00:37:23.840 --> 00:37:27.110 align:middle line:10%
in an adversarial
situation, this book

00:37:27.110 --> 00:37:31.310 align:middle line:10%
provides a guide not only
in practical ways to do that

00:37:31.310 --> 00:37:35.930 align:middle line:10%
but also in ways to return to
peace, to return to stability.

00:37:35.930 --> 00:37:39.950 align:middle line:10%
The book speaks again and again
about how the point of warfare

00:37:39.950 --> 00:37:43.110 align:middle line:10%
is not to be an extended or
permanent state of affairs.

00:37:43.110 --> 00:37:44.330 align:middle line:10%
It's a real state of affairs.

00:37:44.330 --> 00:37:46.250 align:middle line:10%
It may be a necessary
state of affairs.

00:37:46.250 --> 00:37:48.890 align:middle line:10%
But afterwards, you
should return to normalcy

00:37:48.890 --> 00:37:50.300 align:middle line:10%
as soon as possible.

00:37:50.300 --> 00:37:52.640 align:middle line:10%
And don't raise
barriers so high that

00:37:52.640 --> 00:37:55.340 align:middle line:10%
make it impossible
for your adversary,

00:37:55.340 --> 00:37:57.620 align:middle line:10%
for example, to
capitulate, that make

00:37:57.620 --> 00:38:01.670 align:middle line:10%
it impossible for your opponent
to give in without suffering

00:38:01.670 --> 00:38:03.050 align:middle line:10%
total humiliation.

00:38:03.050 --> 00:38:06.230 align:middle line:84%
Don't raise barriers so
high that you can't return

00:38:06.230 --> 00:38:07.460 align:middle line:90%
to some state of stability.

00:38:07.460 --> 00:38:09.627 align:middle line:84%
And that's one of the things
I value about the book.

00:38:09.627 --> 00:38:12.020 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So talk about
it in everyday terms

00:38:12.020 --> 00:38:14.750 align:middle line:84%
now, because people
have divided.

00:38:14.750 --> 00:38:15.740 align:middle line:90%
Families have divided.

00:38:15.740 --> 00:38:18.500 align:middle line:84%
Friendships have divided and not
to come back together anytime

00:38:18.500 --> 00:38:18.760 align:middle line:90%
soon.

00:38:18.760 --> 00:38:20.300 align:middle line:84%
>>HOROWITZ: Not to come
back together anytime soon.

00:38:20.300 --> 00:38:22.670 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Now there's people
seeing one another as--

00:38:22.670 --> 00:38:25.850 align:middle line:84%
which is why I think it's
brilliant to bring this book up

00:38:25.850 --> 00:38:26.870 align:middle line:90%
at this time.

00:38:26.870 --> 00:38:29.990 align:middle line:84%
Not to come back together any
time soon, now seen as enemies,

00:38:29.990 --> 00:38:32.425 align:middle line:90%
how does one approach this?

00:38:32.425 --> 00:38:35.150 align:middle line:84%
>>HOROWITZ: Well,
my principle is

00:38:35.150 --> 00:38:42.290 align:middle line:84%
that the guiding stake behind
all ethics, the guiding

00:38:42.290 --> 00:38:45.500 align:middle line:84%
motive behind all ethics
is the fact that there

00:38:45.500 --> 00:38:47.000 align:middle line:90%
is reciprocity in life.

00:38:47.000 --> 00:38:48.560 align:middle line:90%
We are ultimately joined.

00:38:48.560 --> 00:38:51.350 align:middle line:84%
We are ultimately one--
again, as above so below,

00:38:51.350 --> 00:38:54.630 align:middle line:84%
which seems to be the
theme of our discussion.

00:38:54.630 --> 00:38:57.470 align:middle line:84%
And if you could accept
the fact that there

00:38:57.470 --> 00:39:01.070 align:middle line:84%
is a wholeness to life,
it's not just an expression

00:39:01.070 --> 00:39:02.720 align:middle line:84%
to say that what
you do to another,

00:39:02.720 --> 00:39:03.980 align:middle line:90%
you're doing to yourself.

00:39:03.980 --> 00:39:05.180 align:middle line:90%
You do experience that.

00:39:05.180 --> 00:39:07.710 align:middle line:84%
And this is why I come back
to this again and again.

00:39:07.710 --> 00:39:11.150 align:middle line:84%
I always tell people,
avoid whenever possible

00:39:11.150 --> 00:39:13.970 align:middle line:84%
gossiping, humiliating
other people,

00:39:13.970 --> 00:39:15.920 align:middle line:84%
doing things that
are just designed

00:39:15.920 --> 00:39:20.090 align:middle line:84%
to degrade somebody else for
your own feelings of pleasure

00:39:20.090 --> 00:39:23.270 align:middle line:84%
or satisfaction or
favorable comparison.

00:39:23.270 --> 00:39:24.770 align:middle line:84%
People come to me
sometimes and they

00:39:24.770 --> 00:39:27.170 align:middle line:84%
say, what's one thing I
can do to improve my life?

00:39:27.170 --> 00:39:29.000 align:middle line:84%
And I always give
them the same answer--

00:39:29.000 --> 00:39:30.980 align:middle line:90%
stop gossiping.

00:39:30.980 --> 00:39:36.860 align:middle line:84%
Don't base your sense of self
in humiliating or debasing or

00:39:36.860 --> 00:39:37.940 align:middle line:90%
degrading other people.

00:39:37.940 --> 00:39:41.330 align:middle line:84%
If you can desist from
gossiping for even 24 hours,

00:39:41.330 --> 00:39:44.240 align:middle line:84%
and I mean this, you
will stand taller.

00:39:44.240 --> 00:39:46.110 align:middle line:84%
You will feel better
about yourself.

00:39:46.110 --> 00:39:46.210 align:middle line:90%
You'll sleep better.

00:39:46.210 --> 00:39:47.480 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: I think
you're absolutely right.

00:39:47.480 --> 00:39:49.280 align:middle line:84%
And it's really hard
to do right now--

00:39:49.280 --> 00:39:50.540 align:middle line:90%
>>HOROWITZ: It's hard, yeah.

00:39:50.540 --> 00:39:55.340 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: --because even looking
at standard, mundane sources

00:39:55.340 --> 00:39:59.240 align:middle line:84%
such as news, the
news channels, they're

00:39:59.240 --> 00:40:03.282 align:middle line:84%
peddling in essentially the
demeaning of the other side.

00:40:03.282 --> 00:40:04.490 align:middle line:90%
>>HOROWITZ: Yeah, well, look.

00:40:04.490 --> 00:40:06.680 align:middle line:84%
The social media companies
have figured out how

00:40:06.680 --> 00:40:07.883 align:middle line:90%
to monetize anger, you know?

00:40:07.883 --> 00:40:09.050 align:middle line:90%
It's what drives most posts.

00:40:09.050 --> 00:40:09.680 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Oh, absolutely.

00:40:09.680 --> 00:40:11.000 align:middle line:90%
You saw "The Social Dilemma."

00:40:11.000 --> 00:40:12.450 align:middle line:90%
I'm sure most people here did.

00:40:12.450 --> 00:40:12.470 align:middle line:90%
>>HOROWITZ: Yeah.

00:40:12.470 --> 00:40:13.720 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Very important film.

00:40:13.720 --> 00:40:16.280 align:middle line:84%
>>HOROWITZ: Brilliant movie--
incredibly important movie.

00:40:16.280 --> 00:40:20.240 align:middle line:10%
And it's just so important to
realize that every time I'm

00:40:20.240 --> 00:40:25.310 align:middle line:10%
participating in an anger-filled
chain, that is keeping me

00:40:25.310 --> 00:40:27.440 align:middle line:10%
exactly where they want me.

00:40:27.440 --> 00:40:29.870 align:middle line:10%
My eyes are fixated
on the screen.

00:40:29.870 --> 00:40:31.260 align:middle line:10%
It's a contest.

00:40:31.260 --> 00:40:32.420 align:middle line:10%
I'm angry.

00:40:32.420 --> 00:40:34.800 align:middle line:10%
I'm not going to let
so-and-so get away with this.

00:40:34.800 --> 00:40:38.393 align:middle line:10%
So I would say if you want
to push back against that,

00:40:38.393 --> 00:40:40.060 align:middle line:10%
there's any number
of things you can do.

00:40:40.060 --> 00:40:40.860 align:middle line:10%
You can desist.

00:40:40.860 --> 00:40:42.050 align:middle line:10%
You can unplug.

00:40:42.050 --> 00:40:44.990 align:middle line:10%
I always ask myself the
question, is this necessary?

00:40:44.990 --> 00:40:46.910 align:middle line:10%
Is this necessary?

00:40:46.910 --> 00:40:51.710 align:middle line:10%
Those simple three words can be
such a guardian and such a help

00:40:51.710 --> 00:40:54.860 align:middle line:10%
to protecting you, to
protecting your well-being,

00:40:54.860 --> 00:40:57.020 align:middle line:10%
your reputation,
your psyche, and not

00:40:57.020 --> 00:41:00.080 align:middle line:10%
giving in to this cycle
of monetized anger

00:41:00.080 --> 00:41:01.490 align:middle line:10%
that exists on social media.

00:41:01.490 --> 00:41:04.115 align:middle line:10%
I avoid routinized sarcasm.

00:41:04.115 --> 00:41:04.940 align:middle line:10%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:41:04.940 --> 00:41:07.580 align:middle line:10%
>>HOROWITZ: I avoid
rhetorical questions.

00:41:07.580 --> 00:41:09.920 align:middle line:84%
I avoid trying to
humiliate people

00:41:09.920 --> 00:41:11.610 align:middle line:90%
or using coarse in language.

00:41:11.610 --> 00:41:13.460 align:middle line:84%
I will respond to
people on social media.

00:41:13.460 --> 00:41:15.740 align:middle line:84%
People write to me all
the time with questions.

00:41:15.740 --> 00:41:18.350 align:middle line:84%
I'll respond to anything,
including objections.

00:41:18.350 --> 00:41:21.290 align:middle line:10%
But I will not respond
to sarcasm or rhetorical

00:41:21.290 --> 00:41:22.310 align:middle line:10%
questions.

00:41:22.310 --> 00:41:23.720 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: I think
that's brilliant advice.

00:41:23.720 --> 00:41:24.570 align:middle line:90%
It's very simple.

00:41:24.570 --> 00:41:25.460 align:middle line:90%
It's what we can all do.

00:41:25.460 --> 00:41:27.418 align:middle line:84%
Not everybody's going to
read "The Art of War,"

00:41:27.418 --> 00:41:29.150 align:middle line:84%
even though they
feel their world is--

00:41:29.150 --> 00:41:31.490 align:middle line:84%
they're now
surrounded by enemies.

00:41:31.490 --> 00:41:35.390 align:middle line:84%
The fact is you have to
keep your own mind and heart

00:41:35.390 --> 00:41:36.240 align:middle line:90%
straight amidst it.

00:41:36.240 --> 00:41:37.040 align:middle line:90%
>>HOROWITZ: Yeah.

00:41:37.040 --> 00:41:38.930 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And that might mean
turning off media in general.

00:41:38.930 --> 00:41:39.380 align:middle line:90%
>>HOROWITZ: Absolutely.

00:41:39.380 --> 00:41:41.720 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: I mean, I think to
a large extent turning off

00:41:41.720 --> 00:41:42.260 align:middle line:90%
all media.

00:41:42.260 --> 00:41:42.680 align:middle line:90%
>>HOROWITZ: Right.

00:41:42.680 --> 00:41:44.180 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Personally I've gotten
to the point where I barely

00:41:44.180 --> 00:41:45.260 align:middle line:90%
even get on the computer.

00:41:45.260 --> 00:41:48.440 align:middle line:84%
I write my scripts, do a little
research, answer my emails.

00:41:48.440 --> 00:41:51.703 align:middle line:84%
And I stay away from it because
you cannot get away from

00:41:51.703 --> 00:41:53.995 align:middle line:84%
the perceptions being fed to
you because of algorithms.

00:41:53.995 --> 00:41:54.420 align:middle line:90%
>>HOROWITZ: Absolutely.

00:41:54.420 --> 00:41:55.165 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: It's very difficult.

00:41:55.165 --> 00:41:56.810 align:middle line:10%
>>HOROWITZ: It's
very difficult. I've

00:41:56.810 --> 00:41:58.370 align:middle line:10%
limited my social media intake.

00:41:58.370 --> 00:42:00.140 align:middle line:10%
I've left certain platforms.

00:42:00.140 --> 00:42:01.902 align:middle line:84%
And it has been a
struggle for me,

00:42:01.902 --> 00:42:03.110 align:middle line:90%
which I still struggle with--

00:42:03.110 --> 00:42:03.500 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: It is.

00:42:03.500 --> 00:42:06.050 align:middle line:10%
>>HOROWITZ: --not to get lost
in these secondary storylines

00:42:06.050 --> 00:42:08.150 align:middle line:10%
or arguments that I don't
really want any part of.

00:42:08.150 --> 00:42:09.770 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Because
these conversations

00:42:09.770 --> 00:42:13.100 align:middle line:84%
we're having now, to know
thyself, to examine yourself,

00:42:13.100 --> 00:42:15.260 align:middle line:84%
to find your passion
and put your best out

00:42:15.260 --> 00:42:18.260 align:middle line:84%
into the world has
never been needed more

00:42:18.260 --> 00:42:20.270 align:middle line:84%
than at this very
moment in history,

00:42:20.270 --> 00:42:24.180 align:middle line:84%
to honor the philosophers and
the philosopher in yourself.

00:42:24.180 --> 00:42:26.742 align:middle line:84%
And so we only have a
couple minutes left here.

00:42:26.742 --> 00:42:27.700 align:middle line:90%
We've had so much fun--

00:42:27.700 --> 00:42:28.160 align:middle line:84%
>>HOROWITZ: We're
having a good time.

00:42:28.160 --> 00:42:28.235 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: --we
haven't even gotten

00:42:28.235 --> 00:42:29.630 align:middle line:90%
through 3/4 of the script.

00:42:29.630 --> 00:42:32.570 align:middle line:84%
And there are so many
interesting concepts in here.

00:42:32.570 --> 00:42:35.008 align:middle line:84%
But I want to ask
you just two things,

00:42:35.008 --> 00:42:36.800 align:middle line:84%
one if you can answer
somewhat quickly so I

00:42:36.800 --> 00:42:38.240 align:middle line:90%
can get to the final question.

00:42:38.240 --> 00:42:44.870 align:middle line:84%
And that is, can these ancient
spiritual practices and ideas

00:42:44.870 --> 00:42:48.590 align:middle line:84%
actually disrupt our search
for what we need right now?

00:42:48.590 --> 00:42:51.320 align:middle line:10%
>>HOROWITZ: Oh, I think
ancient spiritual practices

00:42:51.320 --> 00:42:54.770 align:middle line:10%
and ideas, even though they've
come down to us in fragments,

00:42:54.770 --> 00:42:56.660 align:middle line:10%
retain enormous power.

00:42:56.660 --> 00:42:57.590 align:middle line:90%
I have an expression.

00:42:57.590 --> 00:42:59.630 align:middle line:90%
The old gods are lonely.

00:42:59.630 --> 00:43:00.870 align:middle line:90%
The old gods are lonely.

00:43:00.870 --> 00:43:02.162 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes, they're waiting.

00:43:02.162 --> 00:43:05.090 align:middle line:84%
>>HOROWITZ: These energies, if
these are intelligent energies,

00:43:05.090 --> 00:43:06.260 align:middle line:90%
then they have emotions.

00:43:06.260 --> 00:43:09.260 align:middle line:84%
And they can feel a sense
of the lack of contact

00:43:09.260 --> 00:43:10.470 align:middle line:90%
they had with humanity.

00:43:10.470 --> 00:43:13.205 align:middle line:10%
I ask people just to sit with
that, to experiment with that.

00:43:13.205 --> 00:43:14.570 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: I think that's good.

00:43:14.570 --> 00:43:16.118 align:middle line:90%
OK, because I have to ask you.

00:43:16.118 --> 00:43:18.410 align:middle line:84%
I'll just take a minute to
ask you about "The Kybalion"

00:43:18.410 --> 00:43:20.060 align:middle line:84%
at the end, where it
is, when we can see it.

00:43:20.060 --> 00:43:20.860 align:middle line:90%
>>HOROWITZ: Yeah.

00:43:20.860 --> 00:43:26.330 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: But to you,
what is more important,

00:43:26.330 --> 00:43:31.940 align:middle line:84%
to have the mystery, to
have the amazing lure

00:43:31.940 --> 00:43:36.020 align:middle line:84%
and carrot of trying to follow
and unravel the mystery,

00:43:36.020 --> 00:43:37.925 align:middle line:90%
or the answer's more important?

00:43:37.925 --> 00:43:39.830 align:middle line:84%
>>HOROWITZ: I have
to be frank with you.

00:43:39.830 --> 00:43:40.170 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: [LAUGHS]

00:43:40.170 --> 00:43:41.962 align:middle line:84%
>>HOROWITZ: The answers
are more important.

00:43:41.962 --> 00:43:44.450 align:middle line:84%
And I know the response everyone
wants me to give is, oh,

00:43:44.450 --> 00:43:45.250 align:middle line:90%
the mystery.

00:43:45.250 --> 00:43:48.110 align:middle line:90%
But I have to be frank with you.

00:43:48.110 --> 00:43:49.760 align:middle line:90%
I want to find.

00:43:49.760 --> 00:43:50.940 align:middle line:90%
I want victory.

00:43:50.940 --> 00:43:51.980 align:middle line:90%
I want fulfillment.

00:43:51.980 --> 00:43:54.058 align:middle line:84%
It's what I wish for
everyone watching us now.

00:43:54.058 --> 00:43:55.100 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: So the answers.

00:43:55.100 --> 00:43:57.080 align:middle line:90%
Let the mystery inspire you.

00:43:57.080 --> 00:43:59.600 align:middle line:84%
But the satisfaction
comes in ultimately

00:43:59.600 --> 00:44:00.530 align:middle line:90%
finding the answers--

00:44:00.530 --> 00:44:00.860 align:middle line:84%
>>HOROWITZ: Maybe
I would say the--

00:44:00.860 --> 00:44:01.790 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: --as best you can.

00:44:01.790 --> 00:44:02.520 align:middle line:90%
>>HOROWITZ: As best I can.

00:44:02.520 --> 00:44:04.760 align:middle line:84%
I might say the responses
rather than the answers.

00:44:04.760 --> 00:44:08.210 align:middle line:84%
But although I know which
answer is more venerated,

00:44:08.210 --> 00:44:09.967 align:middle line:84%
I have to give
you the frank one.

00:44:09.967 --> 00:44:11.300 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah, no, that's good.

00:44:11.540 --> 00:44:11.960 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: That's good.

00:44:11.960 --> 00:44:12.878 align:middle line:90%
And your film, OK?

00:44:12.878 --> 00:44:14.170 align:middle line:90%
>>HOROWITZ: Oh, "The Kybalion."

00:44:14.170 --> 00:44:15.180 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Yeah,
when's it coming out?

00:44:15.180 --> 00:44:17.555 align:middle line:10%
>>HOROWITZ: "The Kybalion" is
a feature documentary about

00:44:17.555 --> 00:44:19.820 align:middle line:10%
a 1908 occult work
called "The Kybalion,"

00:44:19.820 --> 00:44:22.030 align:middle line:10%
which is a brilliant
polarization of Hermetic

00:44:22.030 --> 00:44:22.830 align:middle line:10%
principles--

00:44:22.830 --> 00:44:23.090 align:middle line:10%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:44:23.090 --> 00:44:25.048 align:middle line:10%
>>HOROWITZ: --everything
we've been discussing.

00:44:25.048 --> 00:44:27.440 align:middle line:84%
The director is Ronni Thomas,
a wonderful Emmy-nominated

00:44:27.440 --> 00:44:28.240 align:middle line:90%
director.

00:44:28.240 --> 00:44:29.330 align:middle line:90%
The movie is done.

00:44:29.330 --> 00:44:31.160 align:middle line:90%
It is complete.

00:44:31.160 --> 00:44:33.380 align:middle line:10%
We have distributors
interested right now.

00:44:33.380 --> 00:44:35.600 align:middle line:10%
And I hope people will
be able to watch it

00:44:35.600 --> 00:44:36.965 align:middle line:10%
in the fall of this year.

00:44:36.965 --> 00:44:38.090 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: I'm so excited.

00:44:38.090 --> 00:44:39.420 align:middle line:90%

00:44:39.420 --> 00:44:40.520 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: I've been waiting
a couple of years for it.

00:44:40.520 --> 00:44:42.770 align:middle line:84%
I saw, I think, just, like,
a 2- or 3-minute piece

00:44:42.770 --> 00:44:43.570 align:middle line:90%
way back when.

00:44:43.570 --> 00:44:44.690 align:middle line:84%
So do you have
trailers out there?

00:44:44.690 --> 00:44:46.025 align:middle line:84%
>>HOROWITZ: Yes, it's
linked up on my website.

00:44:46.025 --> 00:44:46.310 align:middle line:90%

00:44:46.310 --> 00:44:47.075 align:middle line:10%
>>HOROWITZ: You

00:44:49.915 --> 00:44:51.170 align:middle line:10%
So we can get a tease of it.

00:44:51.170 --> 00:44:53.150 align:middle line:90%
It'll be ready fall of 2021.

00:44:53.150 --> 00:44:54.900 align:middle line:84%
Any final thoughts
before we say goodbye?

00:44:54.900 --> 00:44:56.442 align:middle line:84%
>>HOROWITZ: Just I
so appreciate your

00:44:56.442 --> 00:44:57.650 align:middle line:90%
making this space available.

00:44:57.650 --> 00:44:59.690 align:middle line:10%
I mean, you are
providing a space, one

00:44:59.690 --> 00:45:01.760 align:middle line:10%
of the only spaces
in our public life,

00:45:01.760 --> 00:45:03.890 align:middle line:10%
where we can discuss
ancient ideas

00:45:03.890 --> 00:45:06.078 align:middle line:10%
in light of their relevance
in the here and now.

00:45:06.078 --> 00:45:07.370 align:middle line:90%
And I'm very grateful for that.

00:45:07.370 --> 00:45:08.578 align:middle line:90%
