00:00:15.510 --> 00:00:17.510 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA MEREDITH: It
should come as no surprise

00:00:17.510 --> 00:00:20.030 align:middle line:84%
to learn that a college
degree is becoming essentially

00:00:20.030 --> 00:00:22.270 align:middle line:84%
worthless when it
comes to preparing one

00:00:22.270 --> 00:00:24.380 align:middle line:90%
for a life in today's world.

00:00:24.380 --> 00:00:26.920 align:middle line:84%
Dr. Carmen Boulter has
known this for decades.

00:00:26.920 --> 00:00:29.280 align:middle line:10%
In response, she began
creating a new model

00:00:29.280 --> 00:00:32.430 align:middle line:10%
for independent learning
as early as the 1980s

00:00:32.430 --> 00:00:35.370 align:middle line:10%
using computer technology
as the platform.

00:00:35.370 --> 00:00:38.860 align:middle line:10%
Today, she, trendcaster
Gerald Celente, and others

00:00:38.860 --> 00:00:41.600 align:middle line:10%
are openly suggesting
the majority of teens

00:00:41.600 --> 00:00:44.440 align:middle line:10%
should skip going into deep
debt for a college degree

00:00:44.440 --> 00:00:47.700 align:middle line:10%
only to be left with no useful
skills at the other end.

00:00:47.700 --> 00:00:50.700 align:middle line:84%
Instead, they can take control
of their own education,

00:00:50.700 --> 00:00:54.270 align:middle line:84%
tailoring it toward their
passions, skills, and desires.

00:00:54.270 --> 00:00:55.690 align:middle line:90%
Sounds good to me, Carmen.

00:00:55.690 --> 00:00:57.290 align:middle line:84%
Thank you so much
for joining us.

00:00:57.290 --> 00:00:58.970 align:middle line:84%
This is a really
important topic.

00:00:58.970 --> 00:01:00.950 align:middle line:84%
Before we start
talking, we're going

00:01:00.950 --> 00:01:02.609 align:middle line:84%
to run a little
video from YouTube

00:01:02.609 --> 00:01:03.900 align:middle line:90%
that you're very familiar with.

00:01:03.900 --> 00:01:05.850 align:middle line:90%
Gerald Celente is the producer.

00:01:05.850 --> 00:01:07.700 align:middle line:90%
It's called College Conspiracy.

00:01:07.700 --> 00:01:09.450 align:middle line:84%
And then I'd love to
have your reaction.

00:01:09.450 --> 00:01:10.750 align:middle line:90%
Let's take a look.

00:01:10.750 --> 00:01:14.020 align:middle line:84%
>>From the time an American
child reaches the sixth grade,

00:01:14.020 --> 00:01:16.830 align:middle line:84%
they are taught that the
key to success in life

00:01:16.830 --> 00:01:19.990 align:middle line:84%
is to do well in high school
so that they can get accepted

00:01:19.990 --> 00:01:21.680 align:middle line:90%
to the best possible college.

00:01:21.680 --> 00:01:24.510 align:middle line:84%
The better grades they get in
high school, the better college

00:01:24.510 --> 00:01:26.490 align:middle line:84%
they will have an
opportunity to get into.

00:01:26.490 --> 00:01:29.030 align:middle line:84%
They are taught that if they
get into a great college

00:01:29.030 --> 00:01:31.820 align:middle line:84%
and get their college
degree, any type of job

00:01:31.820 --> 00:01:34.320 align:middle line:84%
they desire in the
field of their choice

00:01:34.320 --> 00:01:36.110 align:middle line:90%
will be there waiting for them.

00:01:36.110 --> 00:01:37.910 align:middle line:84%
After getting their
dream job, they

00:01:37.910 --> 00:01:40.590 align:middle line:84%
will be able to buy any
car and house they desire,

00:01:40.590 --> 00:01:44.990 align:middle line:84%
start their own family, and
live the American dream.

00:01:44.990 --> 00:01:47.660 align:middle line:84%
Most Americans today
have an expectation

00:01:47.660 --> 00:01:50.250 align:middle line:84%
of future economic
success simply

00:01:50.250 --> 00:01:52.510 align:middle line:90%
by obtaining a college degree.

00:01:52.510 --> 00:01:54.590 align:middle line:10%
The entire purpose
of elementary school

00:01:54.590 --> 00:01:56.730 align:middle line:10%
is to prepare students
for high school,

00:01:56.730 --> 00:01:58.750 align:middle line:10%
and the entire
purpose of high school

00:01:58.750 --> 00:02:00.980 align:middle line:10%
is to prepare
students for college.

00:02:00.980 --> 00:02:05.090 align:middle line:10%
In fact, the US now has hundreds
of private college preparatory

00:02:05.090 --> 00:02:09.350 align:middle line:10%
high schools that, at a
cost of $25,000 per year,

00:02:09.350 --> 00:02:11.750 align:middle line:10%
are supposed to increase
students' chances of getting

00:02:11.750 --> 00:02:14.360 align:middle line:10%
into a top tier college.

00:02:14.360 --> 00:02:16.510 align:middle line:84%
Students are taught to
believe that if they don't

00:02:16.510 --> 00:02:18.930 align:middle line:84%
go to college, they will
be on a path to nowhere,

00:02:18.930 --> 00:02:23.510 align:middle line:84%
and will have no chance of ever
building a successful career.

00:02:23.510 --> 00:02:25.680 align:middle line:84%
Government regulations
like No Child

00:02:25.680 --> 00:02:29.680 align:middle line:84%
Left Behind have left grade
and high schools in shambles.

00:02:29.680 --> 00:02:31.560 align:middle line:84%
Instead of teachers
having the freedom

00:02:31.560 --> 00:02:35.500 align:middle line:84%
to think outside the box and use
creative techniques to prepare

00:02:35.500 --> 00:02:37.210 align:middle line:84%
their students for
the real world,

00:02:37.210 --> 00:02:39.490 align:middle line:84%
they are forced to
be narrow minded

00:02:39.490 --> 00:02:42.220 align:middle line:84%
and teach with worthless
information that will never

00:02:42.220 --> 00:02:44.940 align:middle line:84%
help their students
have successful careers.

00:02:44.940 --> 00:02:48.230 align:middle line:84%
Today, there are no high
schools left in America

00:02:48.230 --> 00:02:51.060 align:middle line:84%
that teach students the
knowledge necessary to start

00:02:51.060 --> 00:02:53.540 align:middle line:84%
their own business,
invent their own product,

00:02:53.540 --> 00:02:57.450 align:middle line:84%
or even how to use the internet
and other free resources

00:02:57.450 --> 00:03:02.280 align:middle line:84%
to become educated about things
without attending college.

00:03:02.280 --> 00:03:03.980 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: So what say ye?

00:03:03.980 --> 00:03:06.130 align:middle line:84%
That sounds like an
old model for sure,

00:03:06.130 --> 00:03:08.136 align:middle line:84%
but it doesn't sound like
what's working today.

00:03:08.136 --> 00:03:10.010 align:middle line:84%
>>CARMEN BOULTER: It
certainly isn't working.

00:03:10.010 --> 00:03:14.310 align:middle line:84%
In fact, only 32% of students
that graduate from high school

00:03:14.310 --> 00:03:17.370 align:middle line:84%
have the skills necessary
to do college work.

00:03:17.370 --> 00:03:18.065 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: 32%?

00:03:18.065 --> 00:03:18.731 align:middle line:90%
>>BOULTER: Yeah.

00:03:18.731 --> 00:03:19.846 align:middle line:90%
That comes from Harvard.

00:03:19.846 --> 00:03:22.470 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And that's because of
a lowering of the standards all

00:03:22.470 --> 00:03:24.767 align:middle line:84%
the way around, academically
and otherwise, I assume.

00:03:24.767 --> 00:03:26.600 align:middle line:84%
>>BOULTER: I'm very
concerned about literacy

00:03:26.600 --> 00:03:28.350 align:middle line:90%
in the States and Canada.

00:03:28.350 --> 00:03:31.270 align:middle line:84%
There's many, many
things that are gone awry

00:03:31.270 --> 00:03:33.750 align:middle line:90%
with the education system.

00:03:33.750 --> 00:03:36.180 align:middle line:84%
They don't teach
cross-disciplinary things.

00:03:36.180 --> 00:03:39.110 align:middle line:90%
They have individual subjects.

00:03:39.110 --> 00:03:40.940 align:middle line:10%
And the students are
constantly interrupted

00:03:40.940 --> 00:03:43.450 align:middle line:10%
with announcements and whatnot.

00:03:43.450 --> 00:03:45.300 align:middle line:10%
They have to finish
things on the bell.

00:03:45.300 --> 00:03:47.750 align:middle line:10%
There's all kinds of
things that are regimented.

00:03:47.750 --> 00:03:50.359 align:middle line:10%
And the truth is is
that school buildings

00:03:50.359 --> 00:03:52.400 align:middle line:10%
are built by the same
companies that build jails.

00:03:52.400 --> 00:03:53.983 align:middle line:10%
>>REGINA: I was going
to bring that up

00:03:53.983 --> 00:03:56.440 align:middle line:10%
in a little bit--
that build prisons.

00:03:56.440 --> 00:03:57.440 align:middle line:90%
>>BOULTER: Prisons, yes.

00:03:57.440 --> 00:03:59.130 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And you know, it's
no surprise that schools

00:03:59.130 --> 00:04:00.922 align:middle line:84%
feel like a prison to
most of the children.

00:04:00.922 --> 00:04:03.171 align:middle line:84%
>>BOULTER: Well, and they
have to go through scanners,

00:04:03.171 --> 00:04:04.680 align:middle line:84%
they have to pay
attention to bells,

00:04:04.680 --> 00:04:07.040 align:middle line:84%
there's policemen
in the schools,

00:04:07.040 --> 00:04:08.810 align:middle line:90%
and everything is regimented.

00:04:08.810 --> 00:04:11.511 align:middle line:84%
And this does not
foster creativity.

00:04:11.511 --> 00:04:12.385 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: It doesn't.

00:04:12.385 --> 00:04:13.796 align:middle line:84%
And aside from
that, just looking

00:04:13.796 --> 00:04:16.220 align:middle line:84%
at the-- more of the rhythm
of the brain of younger

00:04:16.220 --> 00:04:18.980 align:middle line:84%
children in particular,
and up through teens,

00:04:18.980 --> 00:04:20.890 align:middle line:84%
the studies have
shown a lot of kids

00:04:20.890 --> 00:04:23.430 align:middle line:84%
simply are not even
awake enough to start

00:04:23.430 --> 00:04:25.870 align:middle line:84%
learning until it's
later in the morning.

00:04:25.870 --> 00:04:28.530 align:middle line:84%
I mean, just looking on
a rhythmic level in terms

00:04:28.530 --> 00:04:30.180 align:middle line:84%
of the time we start
school so that it

00:04:30.180 --> 00:04:33.470 align:middle line:84%
can coincide with daycare and
parents getting off to work

00:04:33.470 --> 00:04:34.460 align:middle line:90%
and so forth.

00:04:34.460 --> 00:04:35.777 align:middle line:90%
That's not working, either.

00:04:35.777 --> 00:04:37.360 align:middle line:84%
>>BOULTER: Well, the
simple way to put

00:04:37.360 --> 00:04:41.100 align:middle line:84%
it is that we've fostered
teacher centered teaching

00:04:41.100 --> 00:04:43.885 align:middle line:84%
instead of learner
centered learning.

00:04:43.885 --> 00:04:47.427 align:middle line:84%
And that is the easiest way
to describe the problem.

00:04:47.427 --> 00:04:49.010 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Well,
before we go into some

00:04:49.010 --> 00:04:51.340 align:middle line:84%
of the other
significant problems

00:04:51.340 --> 00:04:53.200 align:middle line:84%
that are going on
there, first of all,

00:04:53.200 --> 00:04:55.526 align:middle line:90%
you have how many degrees?

00:04:55.526 --> 00:04:58.050 align:middle line:90%
>>BOULTER: Five.

00:04:58.050 --> 00:05:00.510 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: I mean, I'm
just bringing that up

00:05:00.510 --> 00:05:02.710 align:middle line:90%
as a point of irony here.

00:05:02.710 --> 00:05:05.114 align:middle line:84%
You have a couple
Ph.D.s, a couple masters.

00:05:05.114 --> 00:05:06.030 align:middle line:90%
Two or three master's?

00:05:06.030 --> 00:05:06.410 align:middle line:90%
>>BOULTER: One master's.

00:05:06.410 --> 00:05:07.170 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: One master?

00:05:07.170 --> 00:05:07.460 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:05:07.460 --> 00:05:08.480 align:middle line:84%
>>BOULTER: I have
a college degree.

00:05:08.480 --> 00:05:08.870 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:05:08.870 --> 00:05:09.435 align:middle line:90%
>>BOULTER: Two bachelor's.

00:05:09.435 --> 00:05:09.850 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: OK.

00:05:09.850 --> 00:05:12.183 align:middle line:84%
>>BOULTER: A master's, and I
actually did a Ph.D. twice.

00:05:12.183 --> 00:05:14.370 align:middle line:84%
I finished a Ph.D., and
I didn't have anybody

00:05:14.370 --> 00:05:16.516 align:middle line:84%
to supervise my
research, so then I

00:05:16.516 --> 00:05:18.140 align:middle line:84%
started over again
and did another one.

00:05:18.140 --> 00:05:19.250 align:middle line:90%
So that would add up to six.

00:05:19.250 --> 00:05:20.660 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: That
would add up to six.

00:05:20.660 --> 00:05:21.159 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:05:21.159 --> 00:05:24.580 align:middle line:84%
So it's not as though you have
a bone with education at all.

00:05:24.580 --> 00:05:25.690 align:middle line:90%
It's not that.

00:05:25.690 --> 00:05:28.527 align:middle line:84%
Obviously, you find
great value in it

00:05:28.527 --> 00:05:29.610 align:middle line:90%
in your own personal life.

00:05:29.610 --> 00:05:32.600 align:middle line:84%
You've been able to spin off
amazing works and projects

00:05:32.600 --> 00:05:35.410 align:middle line:84%
through your life as a
result of this education.

00:05:35.410 --> 00:05:36.990 align:middle line:84%
You're just saying
the way it's being

00:05:36.990 --> 00:05:38.780 align:middle line:90%
done is no longer working.

00:05:38.780 --> 00:05:39.780 align:middle line:90%
>>BOULTER: That's right.

00:05:39.780 --> 00:05:42.850 align:middle line:84%
I started studying alternative
education way back when,

00:05:42.850 --> 00:05:46.780 align:middle line:84%
and looking at how students
could be more served.

00:05:46.780 --> 00:05:50.070 align:middle line:84%
And I also looked at the idea
of different learning styles--

00:05:50.070 --> 00:05:52.110 align:middle line:90%
auditory, visual, kinesthetic.

00:05:52.110 --> 00:05:53.800 align:middle line:90%
Multiple intelligences.

00:05:53.800 --> 00:05:55.640 align:middle line:84%
We have mathematical
intelligence,

00:05:55.640 --> 00:05:58.710 align:middle line:84%
we have musical intelligence,
interpersonal, intrapersonal,

00:05:58.710 --> 00:06:01.310 align:middle line:84%
and it goes on from
there-- scientific-- and we

00:06:01.310 --> 00:06:03.500 align:middle line:84%
need to be feeding all
these things in children.

00:06:03.500 --> 00:06:06.030 align:middle line:84%
But things need to be
combined, you know?

00:06:06.030 --> 00:06:09.230 align:middle line:84%
Like, why can't different
subjects be blended together?

00:06:09.230 --> 00:06:11.150 align:middle line:84%
And so things in schools
are very regimented,

00:06:11.150 --> 00:06:12.566 align:middle line:84%
and it doesn't
work for the brain.

00:06:12.566 --> 00:06:14.104 align:middle line:90%
It doesn't work for the student.

00:06:14.104 --> 00:06:15.770 align:middle line:84%
But what's been
happening is governments

00:06:15.770 --> 00:06:18.520 align:middle line:84%
are looking for numbers,
grades, and tests.

00:06:18.520 --> 00:06:22.260 align:middle line:84%
And test-driven education is
really detrimental to students.

00:06:22.260 --> 00:06:23.650 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Absolutely.

00:06:23.650 --> 00:06:24.580 align:middle line:90%
And teachers.

00:06:24.580 --> 00:06:25.680 align:middle line:90%
>>BOULTER: And teachers.

00:06:25.680 --> 00:06:29.470 align:middle line:84%
And so teachers are among the
most traditional of humans,

00:06:29.470 --> 00:06:31.201 align:middle line:84%
and they work to
rule a lot of them.

00:06:31.201 --> 00:06:33.700 align:middle line:84%
I mean, teachers are really
good people, but a lot of them--

00:06:33.700 --> 00:06:34.908 align:middle line:90%
don't give me anything extra.

00:06:34.908 --> 00:06:37.350 align:middle line:84%
Don't make me have a
different bag of tricks.

00:06:37.350 --> 00:06:38.994 align:middle line:90%
I want to do what's simple.

00:06:38.994 --> 00:06:40.160 align:middle line:90%
And they don't seem to care.

00:06:40.160 --> 00:06:42.510 align:middle line:84%
And it's interesting, it's
ironic, No Child Left Behind,

00:06:42.510 --> 00:06:44.010 align:middle line:84%
because I think
most of the children

00:06:44.010 --> 00:06:46.040 align:middle line:84%
are completely
being left behind.

00:06:46.040 --> 00:06:47.060 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Absolutely.

00:06:47.060 --> 00:06:49.220 align:middle line:84%
Now what was-- theoretically,
what was that agenda

00:06:49.220 --> 00:06:52.245 align:middle line:84%
supposed to be, and what
did it actually become?

00:06:52.245 --> 00:06:53.870 align:middle line:84%
>>BOULTER: Well, I
think it's top down.

00:06:53.870 --> 00:06:54.800 align:middle line:90%
It's administrative.

00:06:54.800 --> 00:06:56.140 align:middle line:90%
It's government heavy.

00:06:56.140 --> 00:06:58.140 align:middle line:84%
And it's trying to prove
things through numbers

00:06:58.140 --> 00:06:59.470 align:middle line:90%
that aren't relevant.

00:06:59.470 --> 00:07:01.510 align:middle line:84%
So in research, there's
two different things

00:07:01.510 --> 00:07:05.560 align:middle line:84%
that we pay attention to--
validity and reliability.

00:07:05.560 --> 00:07:08.240 align:middle line:84%
And validity is are we measuring
what we think we're measuring?

00:07:08.240 --> 00:07:10.620 align:middle line:84%
So they say we're measuring
someone's skill set

00:07:10.620 --> 00:07:14.090 align:middle line:84%
by giving them a test, but
with multiple choice tests,

00:07:14.090 --> 00:07:17.210 align:middle line:84%
every single A, B,
C, D is debatable.

00:07:17.210 --> 00:07:20.170 align:middle line:84%
But the answer that the teacher
wants is the right answer,

00:07:20.170 --> 00:07:24.060 align:middle line:84%
and you could be able to
argue how B has its points,

00:07:24.060 --> 00:07:25.460 align:middle line:90%
has its merits.

00:07:25.460 --> 00:07:26.919 align:middle line:84%
But a multiple
choice test is going

00:07:26.919 --> 00:07:28.626 align:middle line:84%
to be able to go
through a little machine

00:07:28.626 --> 00:07:29.835 align:middle line:90%
and get the score right away.

00:07:29.835 --> 00:07:31.460 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: But again,
this is so narrow.

00:07:31.460 --> 00:07:34.810 align:middle line:84%
This is such a narrow
way of evaluating

00:07:34.810 --> 00:07:37.380 align:middle line:90%
a person's intelligence.

00:07:37.380 --> 00:07:39.545 align:middle line:84%
I mean, knowledge is one
thing, but intelligence.

00:07:39.545 --> 00:07:40.920 align:middle line:84%
And when we're
talking knowledge,

00:07:40.920 --> 00:07:42.060 align:middle line:84%
I don't mean deep
inner knowledge,

00:07:42.060 --> 00:07:43.210 align:middle line:84%
and I want to get
to that in a moment.

00:07:43.210 --> 00:07:45.543 align:middle line:84%
We're talking about what has
been stuffed into the brain

00:07:45.543 --> 00:07:46.391 align:middle line:90%
randomly.

00:07:46.391 --> 00:07:48.390 align:middle line:84%
>>BOULTER: Well, and these
tests-- like in Asia,

00:07:48.390 --> 00:07:52.060 align:middle line:84%
for example-- they'll give a
test in grade eight one time,

00:07:52.060 --> 00:07:54.830 align:middle line:84%
and you get A, B, C, D,
in terms of the levels.

00:07:54.830 --> 00:07:58.310 align:middle line:84%
If you're in A, B, you can
go on to the better level

00:07:58.310 --> 00:07:59.210 align:middle line:90%
universities.

00:07:59.210 --> 00:08:02.390 align:middle line:84%
If you're in C, D, you're
considered a dropout,

00:08:02.390 --> 00:08:04.320 align:middle line:84%
and there's almost no
place for you to go.

00:08:04.320 --> 00:08:06.680 align:middle line:84%
Well, what if your parents
had a fight the night before?

00:08:06.680 --> 00:08:07.920 align:middle line:90%
What if you don't feel well?

00:08:07.920 --> 00:08:10.480 align:middle line:84%
What if you're allergic to
the food you had for lunch?

00:08:10.480 --> 00:08:12.860 align:middle line:90%
And then you're labeled forever.

00:08:12.860 --> 00:08:14.010 align:middle line:90%
That's not fair.

00:08:14.010 --> 00:08:15.230 align:middle line:90%
And the pressure of that.

00:08:15.230 --> 00:08:16.730 align:middle line:84%
It's almost like
your blood pressure

00:08:16.730 --> 00:08:18.040 align:middle line:84%
going up when you
go to the doctor

00:08:18.040 --> 00:08:20.210 align:middle line:84%
because you're afraid they're
going to medicate you.

00:08:20.210 --> 00:08:21.085 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Absolutely.

00:08:21.085 --> 00:08:23.750 align:middle line:84%
And you hear about suicides
among young children in Japan

00:08:23.750 --> 00:08:26.020 align:middle line:84%
as a result of this-- of
disappointing the family

00:08:26.020 --> 00:08:28.280 align:middle line:84%
that they didn't make the
grade to get into the school

00:08:28.280 --> 00:08:30.020 align:middle line:84%
that their mother and
father had chosen for them.

00:08:30.020 --> 00:08:30.360 align:middle line:90%
>>BOULTER: Yeah.

00:08:30.360 --> 00:08:31.169 align:middle line:90%
None of that works.

00:08:31.169 --> 00:08:31.960 align:middle line:90%
None of that works.

00:08:31.960 --> 00:08:32.559 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: No.

00:08:32.559 --> 00:08:35.900 align:middle line:84%
>>BOULTER: And the problem
is it's not constructivist.

00:08:35.900 --> 00:08:38.260 align:middle line:84%
And so when we look at
theories of learning,

00:08:38.260 --> 00:08:40.740 align:middle line:84%
the importance is to
build on what you know.

00:08:40.740 --> 00:08:42.990 align:middle line:84%
And so everybody comes in
with gaps in their learning,

00:08:42.990 --> 00:08:45.920 align:middle line:84%
particularly in language
learning, right?

00:08:45.920 --> 00:08:49.010 align:middle line:84%
And so people don't
start in the same place.

00:08:49.010 --> 00:08:51.660 align:middle line:84%
But the other thing
is meaning centered.

00:08:51.660 --> 00:08:53.590 align:middle line:84%
Most of what we're
doing in schools

00:08:53.590 --> 00:08:56.310 align:middle line:84%
right now is not
meaningful at all.

00:08:56.310 --> 00:08:59.890 align:middle line:84%
But especially now with
smartphones and internet,

00:08:59.890 --> 00:09:03.930 align:middle line:84%
memorizing lists of facts
is completely irrelevant.

00:09:03.930 --> 00:09:07.220 align:middle line:84%
A, you can access them
easily, but B, in 15 minutes,

00:09:07.220 --> 00:09:10.700 align:middle line:84%
if you knew every single thing
on internet, in 15 minutes,

00:09:10.700 --> 00:09:13.130 align:middle line:84%
it's irrelevant, because
things keep changing.

00:09:13.130 --> 00:09:14.880 align:middle line:84%
And what they're
using in schools

00:09:14.880 --> 00:09:17.520 align:middle line:84%
is textbooks with 20
year old information

00:09:17.520 --> 00:09:22.250 align:middle line:84%
that cost $200, when you can
get all the information online

00:09:22.250 --> 00:09:24.100 align:middle line:90%
in a more colorful way.

00:09:24.100 --> 00:09:24.910 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:09:24.910 --> 00:09:28.140 align:middle line:90%
And also, in an interactive way.

00:09:28.140 --> 00:09:29.470 align:middle line:90%
And, as you say, colorful.

00:09:29.470 --> 00:09:30.680 align:middle line:90%
Multimedia.

00:09:30.680 --> 00:09:32.190 align:middle line:90%
Let's back up.

00:09:32.190 --> 00:09:33.830 align:middle line:84%
In our last
conversation, which we

00:09:33.830 --> 00:09:38.570 align:middle line:84%
had this wonderful conversation
about the 18th dynasty

00:09:38.570 --> 00:09:42.270 align:middle line:84%
in Egypt, and about the
matriarchy in Egypt.

00:09:42.270 --> 00:09:45.540 align:middle line:84%
And going back into that,
you spoke of the fact

00:09:45.540 --> 00:09:47.670 align:middle line:84%
that once upon a
time, human beings

00:09:47.670 --> 00:09:51.780 align:middle line:84%
were utilizing 360
senses, which, obviously,

00:09:51.780 --> 00:09:55.030 align:middle line:84%
has to be extending all of us
out into all of that in order

00:09:55.030 --> 00:09:56.470 align:middle line:90%
to bring that in.

00:09:56.470 --> 00:10:01.340 align:middle line:84%
Now what we have is this is
narrowed down to five senses--

00:10:01.340 --> 00:10:02.240 align:middle line:90%
six, if you're lucky.

00:10:02.240 --> 00:10:05.040 align:middle line:84%
You have a little
intuition going for you.

00:10:05.040 --> 00:10:10.850 align:middle line:84%
What happens with a child,
for example, when-- well,

00:10:10.850 --> 00:10:13.300 align:middle line:84%
for example, until the last
100 years, we didn't all read.

00:10:13.300 --> 00:10:16.440 align:middle line:84%
The population at large
did not read, right?

00:10:16.440 --> 00:10:18.380 align:middle line:84%
Historically, that
was for initiates.

00:10:18.380 --> 00:10:19.430 align:middle line:90%
It was for professors.

00:10:19.430 --> 00:10:20.630 align:middle line:90%
It was for the learned.

00:10:20.630 --> 00:10:22.510 align:middle line:90%
The average person did not.

00:10:22.510 --> 00:10:27.620 align:middle line:84%
What has that done
to our brains,

00:10:27.620 --> 00:10:31.250 align:middle line:84%
to start taking information
in in digital form like that,

00:10:31.250 --> 00:10:34.310 align:middle line:84%
as opposed to a more
holistic kind of learning?

00:10:34.310 --> 00:10:35.749 align:middle line:90%
Good and bad.

00:10:35.749 --> 00:10:37.790 align:middle line:84%
>>BOULTER: Well, education
is for the left brain.

00:10:37.790 --> 00:10:38.900 align:middle line:90%
That's all there is to it.

00:10:38.900 --> 00:10:41.210 align:middle line:84%
Reading, writing,
arithmetic-- what you can see.

00:10:41.210 --> 00:10:42.640 align:middle line:90%
Mechanical things.

00:10:42.640 --> 00:10:47.550 align:middle line:84%
And the whole brain is
involving symbolism and mystery

00:10:47.550 --> 00:10:50.540 align:middle line:84%
and impressions and art
and that sort of thing.

00:10:50.540 --> 00:10:52.540 align:middle line:90%
And that's just been locked off.

00:10:52.540 --> 00:10:57.180 align:middle line:84%
We really have isolated the
entirety of the left brain

00:10:57.180 --> 00:10:57.990 align:middle line:90%
thinking.

00:10:57.990 --> 00:10:59.710 align:middle line:90%
And that just doesn't work.

00:10:59.710 --> 00:11:01.740 align:middle line:84%
I mean, that creates
all kinds of imbalances.

00:11:01.740 --> 00:11:03.823 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Well, and we
even relegated the ancients

00:11:03.823 --> 00:11:09.200 align:middle line:84%
to, essentially, uneducated
savages who left nothing

00:11:09.200 --> 00:11:12.890 align:middle line:84%
but a few symbols behind
for us in these great works.

00:11:12.890 --> 00:11:15.680 align:middle line:84%
>>BOULTER: Well, that's
just patriarchal ways

00:11:15.680 --> 00:11:18.720 align:middle line:84%
of being and thinking that
have just been pushed on us.

00:11:18.720 --> 00:11:20.830 align:middle line:90%
And it's all a dominator model.

00:11:20.830 --> 00:11:22.910 align:middle line:84%
And so in the current
education system,

00:11:22.910 --> 00:11:24.670 align:middle line:90%
the teacher is the dominator.

00:11:24.670 --> 00:11:26.990 align:middle line:84%
The person standing at the
front has the knowledge

00:11:26.990 --> 00:11:29.210 align:middle line:84%
and the power, and the
people sitting in the chairs

00:11:29.210 --> 00:11:30.260 align:middle line:90%
don't have anything.

00:11:30.260 --> 00:11:31.417 align:middle line:90%
But that doesn't work.

00:11:31.417 --> 00:11:33.000 align:middle line:84%
And so if you look
at online learning,

00:11:33.000 --> 00:11:35.070 align:middle line:90%
it flattens the hierarchies.

00:11:35.070 --> 00:11:37.640 align:middle line:84%
Everybody becomes a teacher,
everybody becomes a learner,

00:11:37.640 --> 00:11:39.250 align:middle line:90%
and things go around.

00:11:39.250 --> 00:11:41.020 align:middle line:84%
But when you think
of interactivity,

00:11:41.020 --> 00:11:43.610 align:middle line:84%
if you look to learning
theory, interactivity

00:11:43.610 --> 00:11:45.710 align:middle line:90%
is the key to learning.

00:11:45.710 --> 00:11:48.060 align:middle line:90%
So there's six different things.

00:11:48.060 --> 00:11:50.170 align:middle line:84%
The student interacting
with the material,

00:11:50.170 --> 00:11:52.150 align:middle line:84%
the student interacting
with the teacher,

00:11:52.150 --> 00:11:53.920 align:middle line:84%
students interacting
with each other,

00:11:53.920 --> 00:11:56.870 align:middle line:84%
teachers interacting with each
other, and then the material

00:11:56.870 --> 00:11:59.470 align:middle line:84%
interacting in some
way, through people

00:11:59.470 --> 00:12:01.100 align:middle line:90%
looking at various projects.

00:12:01.100 --> 00:12:03.205 align:middle line:84%
Well, some people say
that if you're online,

00:12:03.205 --> 00:12:04.900 align:middle line:90%
you don't get any interactivity.

00:12:04.900 --> 00:12:06.670 align:middle line:84%
It couldn't be further
from the truth.

00:12:06.670 --> 00:12:09.020 align:middle line:84%
And so some people say if
you're doing online learning,

00:12:09.020 --> 00:12:10.340 align:middle line:84%
you spend the day
at the computer.

00:12:10.340 --> 00:12:11.715 align:middle line:84%
But you could be
doing a research

00:12:11.715 --> 00:12:15.940 align:middle line:84%
project in a kayak on seal
behavior, and film it,

00:12:15.940 --> 00:12:18.480 align:middle line:84%
and then go back to your
computer and plug it in.

00:12:18.480 --> 00:12:19.660 align:middle line:90%
It takes about two minutes.

00:12:19.660 --> 00:12:22.430 align:middle line:84%
And then let it upload and
then come back and unplug it.

00:12:22.430 --> 00:12:24.440 align:middle line:84%
You were not sitting at
the computer all day.

00:12:24.440 --> 00:12:26.430 align:middle line:84%
But you communicated
the information

00:12:26.430 --> 00:12:27.560 align:middle line:90%
through the computer.

00:12:27.560 --> 00:12:30.554 align:middle line:84%
So there's a lot of misnomers
about how students shouldn't

00:12:30.554 --> 00:12:32.220 align:middle line:84%
have their cell phones
in the classroom.

00:12:32.220 --> 00:12:32.860 align:middle line:90%
Why not?

00:12:32.860 --> 00:12:34.730 align:middle line:84%
I used to say, when
I taught in Taiwan--

00:12:34.730 --> 00:12:36.271 align:middle line:84%
I've taught at many
different levels,

00:12:36.271 --> 00:12:38.190 align:middle line:84%
and I also taught
in Asia at a college

00:12:38.190 --> 00:12:39.664 align:middle line:90%
that became a university.

00:12:39.664 --> 00:12:41.080 align:middle line:84%
If you can't beat
them, join them.

00:12:41.080 --> 00:12:43.230 align:middle line:84%
If they've got these
cell phones and they

00:12:43.230 --> 00:12:45.630 align:middle line:84%
can make videos and
edit them, why not

00:12:45.630 --> 00:12:48.220 align:middle line:84%
let that be part of
their presentation?

00:12:48.220 --> 00:12:50.970 align:middle line:84%
So there's so much technology
that can help people,

00:12:50.970 --> 00:12:53.050 align:middle line:84%
and yet you see, if
you go down the hall

00:12:53.050 --> 00:12:57.310 align:middle line:84%
in a school, people sitting in
front of worksheets, totally

00:12:57.310 --> 00:12:59.620 align:middle line:90%
quiet, and their little pencil.

00:12:59.620 --> 00:13:03.390 align:middle line:84%
And I have recently done an
evaluation of a full program

00:13:03.390 --> 00:13:04.200 align:middle line:90%
at a university.

00:13:04.200 --> 00:13:07.380 align:middle line:84%
I was asked to be
a peer consultant.

00:13:07.380 --> 00:13:09.550 align:middle line:84%
And they were all
complaining that they

00:13:09.550 --> 00:13:11.890 align:middle line:84%
didn't have enough
funding for professors.

00:13:11.890 --> 00:13:14.310 align:middle line:84%
And they were spending
the exact amount

00:13:14.310 --> 00:13:17.982 align:middle line:84%
of a professor's salary
for a year on photocopying.

00:13:17.982 --> 00:13:18.690 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Really?

00:13:18.690 --> 00:13:19.315 align:middle line:90%
>>BOULTER: Yep.

00:13:19.315 --> 00:13:22.910 align:middle line:84%
And when you say, stop that,
they don't know what to do.

00:13:22.910 --> 00:13:24.790 align:middle line:84%
So they're handing
binders to each other.

00:13:24.790 --> 00:13:28.430 align:middle line:84%
They could be doing their
teacher meetings asynchronously

00:13:28.430 --> 00:13:31.490 align:middle line:84%
online, meaning
not in real time.

00:13:31.490 --> 00:13:33.650 align:middle line:84%
And when they get home,
they can run the meeting,

00:13:33.650 --> 00:13:36.130 align:middle line:84%
and they can make their
comments on a discussion board.

00:13:36.130 --> 00:13:38.350 align:middle line:84%
All these things
reduce the workload.

00:13:38.350 --> 00:13:41.710 align:middle line:84%
But when people look at what
it would take to change,

00:13:41.710 --> 00:13:44.210 align:middle line:84%
they get really scared,
because I can't take anymore.

00:13:44.210 --> 00:13:45.780 align:middle line:90%
I don't want to do anymore.

00:13:45.780 --> 00:13:47.170 align:middle line:90%
And it's really quite simple.

00:13:47.170 --> 00:13:50.440 align:middle line:84%
And so in my online courses,
I taught my students

00:13:50.440 --> 00:13:51.730 align:middle line:90%
to go paperless.

00:13:51.730 --> 00:13:53.520 align:middle line:90%
Paperless in the classroom.

00:13:53.520 --> 00:13:55.700 align:middle line:90%
And to be completely digital.

00:13:55.700 --> 00:13:57.695 align:middle line:84%
And it's delightful,
because it's

00:13:57.695 --> 00:14:00.467 align:middle line:84%
a completely different
way of teaching.

00:14:00.467 --> 00:14:02.800 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Going back into
what's already being done now,

00:14:02.800 --> 00:14:05.020 align:middle line:84%
some of the classical
ways, but offshoots

00:14:05.020 --> 00:14:09.720 align:middle line:84%
of that-- some of the systems
that are already in existence

00:14:09.720 --> 00:14:13.140 align:middle line:84%
are actually seemingly
working pretty well,

00:14:13.140 --> 00:14:15.760 align:middle line:84%
such as the Waldorf System,
and some of the other charter

00:14:15.760 --> 00:14:17.900 align:middle line:90%
school systems.

00:14:17.900 --> 00:14:20.140 align:middle line:84%
I have a fondness for
the Waldorf System,

00:14:20.140 --> 00:14:22.660 align:middle line:84%
simply because it
really did focus

00:14:22.660 --> 00:14:25.960 align:middle line:84%
on creativity first and a
more integrated approach

00:14:25.960 --> 00:14:27.040 align:middle line:90%
to learning.

00:14:27.040 --> 00:14:29.480 align:middle line:84%
And one of the things--
I mean, for example,

00:14:29.480 --> 00:14:33.171 align:middle line:84%
as a high schooler, you had to
be outdoors from first grade

00:14:33.171 --> 00:14:33.670 align:middle line:90%
on.

00:14:33.670 --> 00:14:35.990 align:middle line:10%
You had to be planting
seeds, and then

00:14:35.990 --> 00:14:37.840 align:middle line:10%
harvesting the
seeds in the fall,

00:14:37.840 --> 00:14:41.510 align:middle line:10%
and making your bread out of
them for whatever occasion.

00:14:41.510 --> 00:14:46.020 align:middle line:84%
And it's really a hands
on kind of education.

00:14:46.020 --> 00:14:48.170 align:middle line:84%
You're interacting
with the world.

00:14:48.170 --> 00:14:50.570 align:middle line:84%
Now, what about those
kinds of programs?

00:14:50.570 --> 00:14:53.110 align:middle line:84%
How does that interface with
what you're talking about?

00:14:53.110 --> 00:14:54.860 align:middle line:84%
>>BOULTER: Well, to
me, that's the answer.

00:14:54.860 --> 00:14:55.700 align:middle line:90%
It's synthesized.

00:14:55.700 --> 00:14:58.000 align:middle line:90%
It's integrated in Waldorf.

00:14:58.000 --> 00:15:00.550 align:middle line:84%
They're doing signs
for the letters.

00:15:00.550 --> 00:15:01.751 align:middle line:90%
They're acting them out.

00:15:01.751 --> 00:15:03.500 align:middle line:84%
If they're putting
your feet on the ground

00:15:03.500 --> 00:15:05.150 align:middle line:84%
and putting their
hands in the ground,

00:15:05.150 --> 00:15:07.380 align:middle line:84%
they're actually
communing with nature.

00:15:07.380 --> 00:15:10.440 align:middle line:84%
But in the diagnostic
criteria for psychologists

00:15:10.440 --> 00:15:12.280 align:middle line:84%
and psychiatrists, the
new ones coming out,

00:15:12.280 --> 00:15:14.800 align:middle line:84%
there's such a thing
as nature deprivation.

00:15:14.800 --> 00:15:17.130 align:middle line:84%
So the obvious thing would
be to take these children,

00:15:17.130 --> 00:15:19.490 align:middle line:84%
take their shoes off, and
put them on the grass.

00:15:19.490 --> 00:15:21.531 align:middle line:84%
But what they're doing is
they're medicating them

00:15:21.531 --> 00:15:24.300 align:middle line:84%
with antidepressants with
a side effect of suicide.

00:15:24.300 --> 00:15:27.210 align:middle line:84%
Like, how is that ever
going to be a good idea?

00:15:27.210 --> 00:15:31.190 align:middle line:84%
But it's the way we've
deviated so far from nature,

00:15:31.190 --> 00:15:33.920 align:middle line:90%
and not valued that.

00:15:33.920 --> 00:15:36.500 align:middle line:84%
And so the Waldorf system,
the Montessori system,

00:15:36.500 --> 00:15:39.390 align:middle line:84%
that is the true essence
of alternative education

00:15:39.390 --> 00:15:41.940 align:middle line:84%
that's looking at
the whole person,

00:15:41.940 --> 00:15:44.180 align:middle line:84%
that puts the
students first, that

00:15:44.180 --> 00:15:46.600 align:middle line:84%
puts the way the
brain functions first.

00:15:46.600 --> 00:15:48.814 align:middle line:90%
To me, that's an answer.

00:15:48.814 --> 00:15:50.230 align:middle line:84%
But it's not
happening everywhere,

00:15:50.230 --> 00:15:51.125 align:middle line:84%
by any stretch of
the imagination.

00:15:51.125 --> 00:15:52.166 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: No, not at all.

00:15:52.166 --> 00:15:54.367 align:middle line:84%
I mean, there are few
Waldorf charter schools that

00:15:54.367 --> 00:15:56.700 align:middle line:84%
are starting to come up that
are publicly supported now,

00:15:56.700 --> 00:15:59.140 align:middle line:84%
which I find at
least a step forward.

00:15:59.140 --> 00:16:01.280 align:middle line:84%
What do you think--
now, stepping back

00:16:01.280 --> 00:16:04.310 align:middle line:84%
even further
philosophically, do you

00:16:04.310 --> 00:16:07.020 align:middle line:84%
think that there has been
a very specific agenda

00:16:07.020 --> 00:16:11.050 align:middle line:84%
as to the type of person
that the current type

00:16:11.050 --> 00:16:13.364 align:middle line:84%
of educational system
is churning out?

00:16:13.364 --> 00:16:14.780 align:middle line:84%
>>BOULTER: Well,
we haven't really

00:16:14.780 --> 00:16:17.810 align:middle line:84%
changed our education
system in 100 years.

00:16:17.810 --> 00:16:19.520 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: But in
that last 100 years,

00:16:19.520 --> 00:16:22.940 align:middle line:84%
do you think there was
actually some kind of agenda?

00:16:22.940 --> 00:16:23.650 align:middle line:90%
>>BOULTER: Yes.

00:16:23.650 --> 00:16:25.829 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And can you
explain what that is?

00:16:25.829 --> 00:16:27.370 align:middle line:84%
>>BOULTER: What the
corporations were

00:16:27.370 --> 00:16:30.312 align:middle line:84%
looking for is obedient
factory workers.

00:16:30.312 --> 00:16:31.270 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: There you go.

00:16:31.270 --> 00:16:34.170 align:middle line:84%
>>BOULTER: Not somebody who
could be creative and become

00:16:34.170 --> 00:16:37.390 align:middle line:84%
the corporation themselves--
run their own corporation.

00:16:37.390 --> 00:16:40.490 align:middle line:84%
And so we were never taught
how to balance our checkbook.

00:16:40.490 --> 00:16:42.650 align:middle line:84%
We were never taught
how to do life skills.

00:16:42.650 --> 00:16:44.620 align:middle line:84%
We were taught
systematic things that

00:16:44.620 --> 00:16:47.640 align:middle line:84%
could be measured in tests that
give you a score that tell you

00:16:47.640 --> 00:16:49.600 align:middle line:84%
if you're good or
bad, which isn't

00:16:49.600 --> 00:16:50.850 align:middle line:90%
dealing with the whole person.

00:16:50.850 --> 00:16:53.190 align:middle line:84%
Think of the waste
of human resources

00:16:53.190 --> 00:16:55.560 align:middle line:84%
with that, because people
aren't being creative.

00:16:55.560 --> 00:16:56.970 align:middle line:90%
Now, what is creative thinking?

00:16:56.970 --> 00:16:59.100 align:middle line:84%
Creative thinking,
technically-- I've studied this.

00:16:59.100 --> 00:17:02.150 align:middle line:84%
My master's research was on
it-- is the interactivity

00:17:02.150 --> 00:17:04.130 align:middle line:84%
between the two sides
of the brain, which

00:17:04.130 --> 00:17:05.890 align:middle line:84%
comes through the
corpus callosum.

00:17:05.890 --> 00:17:07.710 align:middle line:84%
And as we mentioned in
the other interview,

00:17:07.710 --> 00:17:10.079 align:middle line:84%
the Egyptians even had
crowns with snake figures

00:17:10.079 --> 00:17:11.736 align:middle line:84%
that went across
the corpus callosum.

00:17:11.736 --> 00:17:13.819 align:middle line:84%
And if you get stuck in
either side of your brain,

00:17:13.819 --> 00:17:16.420 align:middle line:84%
you're not able to
think creatively.

00:17:16.420 --> 00:17:17.920 align:middle line:84%
But that's not
what's being studied.

00:17:17.920 --> 00:17:19.930 align:middle line:84%
They're not asking
for creativity.

00:17:19.930 --> 00:17:22.119 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: In fact, as soon
as the budgets started

00:17:22.119 --> 00:17:24.728 align:middle line:84%
being slashed over the last
decade and a half or so,

00:17:24.728 --> 00:17:26.519 align:middle line:84%
the first thing that
went was art programs.

00:17:26.519 --> 00:17:27.520 align:middle line:90%
>>BOULTER: That's right.

00:17:27.520 --> 00:17:29.602 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And a lot of
physical education programs

00:17:29.602 --> 00:17:30.680 align:middle line:90%
started going after that.

00:17:30.680 --> 00:17:31.325 align:middle line:90%
>>BOULTER: And music.

00:17:31.325 --> 00:17:32.630 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Music started going.

00:17:32.630 --> 00:17:35.550 align:middle line:84%
>>BOULTER: But they force
mathematical skills and science

00:17:35.550 --> 00:17:37.900 align:middle line:84%
skills on people who
are more artistic,

00:17:37.900 --> 00:17:39.447 align:middle line:90%
and the other way around.

00:17:39.447 --> 00:17:40.280 align:middle line:90%
And it doesn't work.

00:17:40.280 --> 00:17:41.696 align:middle line:84%
So they're really
literally trying

00:17:41.696 --> 00:17:43.140 align:middle line:90%
to force everybody into a mold.

00:17:43.140 --> 00:17:45.110 align:middle line:90%
And no one fits in those molds.

00:17:45.110 --> 00:17:47.794 align:middle line:84%
And so most students
are completely bored.

00:17:47.794 --> 00:17:49.710 align:middle line:84%
And if you think about
online learning-- let's

00:17:49.710 --> 00:17:51.840 align:middle line:84%
just talk about video
tutorials for a minute.

00:17:51.840 --> 00:17:54.560 align:middle line:84%
If you're learning the computer,
and you're in a classroom,

00:17:54.560 --> 00:17:56.430 align:middle line:84%
everyone's starting
in a different place,

00:17:56.430 --> 00:17:59.620 align:middle line:84%
and everybody has different
scaffolding and understanding

00:17:59.620 --> 00:18:00.570 align:middle line:90%
for their learning.

00:18:00.570 --> 00:18:04.080 align:middle line:84%
And so if you were doing a
series of video tutorials,

00:18:04.080 --> 00:18:07.560 align:middle line:84%
you alone may go through
one to three really quickly,

00:18:07.560 --> 00:18:10.010 align:middle line:84%
and on number four, you go,
I don't understand that.

00:18:10.010 --> 00:18:11.700 align:middle line:84%
And then you could
explore a little bit

00:18:11.700 --> 00:18:13.520 align:middle line:84%
and go and look at the
definition of terms.

00:18:13.520 --> 00:18:16.500 align:middle line:84%
Which definitions are
you not understanding?

00:18:16.500 --> 00:18:18.650 align:middle line:90%
Ask some questions about that.

00:18:18.650 --> 00:18:20.904 align:middle line:84%
Maybe review number
four 10 times.

00:18:20.904 --> 00:18:22.320 align:middle line:84%
But if you're
sitting by yourself,

00:18:22.320 --> 00:18:23.490 align:middle line:90%
no one knows you've done that.

00:18:23.490 --> 00:18:24.490 align:middle line:90%
Oh, five, six, seven, eight.

00:18:24.490 --> 00:18:25.532 align:middle line:90%
Oh, you get those, right?

00:18:25.532 --> 00:18:26.948 align:middle line:84%
But the person
sitting next to you

00:18:26.948 --> 00:18:28.580 align:middle line:84%
is going to get
stumped somewhere else.

00:18:28.580 --> 00:18:30.850 align:middle line:84%
So if you learn computers
or a certain subject

00:18:30.850 --> 00:18:33.547 align:middle line:84%
in the classroom, then you
have to wait for everybody

00:18:33.547 --> 00:18:34.880 align:middle line:90%
to get it as you're bored stiff.

00:18:34.880 --> 00:18:35.546 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:18:35.546 --> 00:18:37.650 align:middle line:84%
It can move no faster
than the slowest person.

00:18:37.650 --> 00:18:38.750 align:middle line:84%
>>BOULTER: No, but
then when it comes time

00:18:38.750 --> 00:18:40.335 align:middle line:84%
and you don't understand,
it goes flying right

00:18:40.335 --> 00:18:41.890 align:middle line:84%
over your head, and they're
on to the next thing.

00:18:41.890 --> 00:18:42.215 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: That, too.

00:18:42.215 --> 00:18:43.881 align:middle line:84%
>>BOULTER: That's
completely not useful.

00:18:43.881 --> 00:18:46.050 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: You know,
there's a system--

00:18:46.050 --> 00:18:48.900 align:middle line:90%
there was a series of books.

00:18:48.900 --> 00:18:52.200 align:middle line:84%
You can call them whatever
you want to call them.

00:18:52.200 --> 00:18:53.740 align:middle line:84%
The Anastasia Ringing
Cedars series,

00:18:53.740 --> 00:18:55.450 align:middle line:84%
which I know you've
read and I've read,

00:18:55.450 --> 00:18:57.320 align:middle line:84%
and I just found them
magical, personally.

00:18:57.320 --> 00:18:59.610 align:middle line:84%
But one of the things I
was most intrigued with

00:18:59.610 --> 00:19:01.970 align:middle line:84%
was the way the children
were treated in the education

00:19:01.970 --> 00:19:02.770 align:middle line:90%
system.

00:19:02.770 --> 00:19:05.730 align:middle line:84%
And a couple of years
ago, something happened.

00:19:05.730 --> 00:19:06.850 align:middle line:90%
I was poised.

00:19:06.850 --> 00:19:09.000 align:middle line:84%
I was over in Eastern
Europe, ready to go

00:19:09.000 --> 00:19:10.660 align:middle line:90%
do a story on that school.

00:19:10.660 --> 00:19:13.920 align:middle line:84%
I had seen a documentary,
because this Anastasia style

00:19:13.920 --> 00:19:16.020 align:middle line:90%
school had been created.

00:19:16.020 --> 00:19:17.620 align:middle line:84%
It's in Russia,
which, of course,

00:19:17.620 --> 00:19:19.180 align:middle line:90%
they're ahead in so many things.

00:19:19.180 --> 00:19:21.430 align:middle line:84%
But one of the things I
found fascinating about it

00:19:21.430 --> 00:19:23.900 align:middle line:84%
was that there
were no professors.

00:19:23.900 --> 00:19:27.070 align:middle line:84%
And again, there wasn't
the same kind of hierarchy.

00:19:27.070 --> 00:19:29.830 align:middle line:84%
I mean there was definitely an
agenda to keep the kids busy.

00:19:29.830 --> 00:19:31.840 align:middle line:90%
There was no idle time.

00:19:31.840 --> 00:19:33.002 align:middle line:90%
Kids do need idle time.

00:19:33.002 --> 00:19:34.460 align:middle line:84%
If there was a flaw
in the program,

00:19:34.460 --> 00:19:36.880 align:middle line:84%
I would say that it was
the lack of idle time.

00:19:36.880 --> 00:19:39.020 align:middle line:84%
But what was interesting
is if there was a subject

00:19:39.020 --> 00:19:44.250 align:middle line:84%
to be studied, you took people
from varying age groups.

00:19:44.250 --> 00:19:46.790 align:middle line:84%
You could have an 8 year
old in with an 18 year

00:19:46.790 --> 00:19:50.300 align:middle line:84%
old studying something
of a mechanical nature,

00:19:50.300 --> 00:19:52.360 align:middle line:84%
or something of a
scientific nature.

00:19:52.360 --> 00:19:56.420 align:middle line:84%
And together as a group,
they evaluated and studied

00:19:56.420 --> 00:19:59.460 align:middle line:84%
the subject completely
out until they

00:19:59.460 --> 00:20:03.640 align:middle line:84%
felt that they had complete
understanding of it.

00:20:03.640 --> 00:20:06.310 align:middle line:84%
And the only time a
teacher came into play

00:20:06.310 --> 00:20:07.950 align:middle line:84%
is if they felt
they were stumped,

00:20:07.950 --> 00:20:09.665 align:middle line:84%
and there was still
a missing piece.

00:20:09.665 --> 00:20:11.830 align:middle line:84%
They weren't connecting
the dots somewhere.

00:20:11.830 --> 00:20:13.920 align:middle line:84%
And sometimes, it might
be the youngest among them

00:20:13.920 --> 00:20:15.450 align:middle line:90%
who was the most brilliant.

00:20:15.450 --> 00:20:18.140 align:middle line:84%
So there was
literally no hierarchy

00:20:18.140 --> 00:20:19.560 align:middle line:90%
in the sense of learning.

00:20:19.560 --> 00:20:22.350 align:middle line:84%
What do you think about that--
that kind of immersion group

00:20:22.350 --> 00:20:23.190 align:middle line:90%
think?

00:20:23.190 --> 00:20:24.910 align:middle line:84%
>>BOULTER: Well,
there's no hierarchy

00:20:24.910 --> 00:20:26.499 align:middle line:84%
in a matriarchal
culture, either.

00:20:26.499 --> 00:20:28.540 align:middle line:84%
Again, it's all about
flattening the hierarchies.

00:20:28.540 --> 00:20:30.260 align:middle line:84%
But think about a
family grouping.

00:20:30.260 --> 00:20:33.780 align:middle line:84%
And this extends-- there's a
child, there's an older child,

00:20:33.780 --> 00:20:35.050 align:middle line:90%
but even mommy and daddy.

00:20:35.050 --> 00:20:37.860 align:middle line:84%
So if there were two
teachers interacting

00:20:37.860 --> 00:20:40.150 align:middle line:84%
at the front of the room,
like mommy and daddy,

00:20:40.150 --> 00:20:41.670 align:middle line:84%
that's also useful
to the students.

00:20:41.670 --> 00:20:43.780 align:middle line:84%
One can be at the front,
one can be moving around.

00:20:43.780 --> 00:20:47.160 align:middle line:84%
But I always put my
students in family groupings

00:20:47.160 --> 00:20:49.110 align:middle line:84%
with a lower level student
with a higher level

00:20:49.110 --> 00:20:51.150 align:middle line:90%
student working together.

00:20:51.150 --> 00:20:52.970 align:middle line:84%
So the lower level
student says, well, I

00:20:52.970 --> 00:20:53.690 align:middle line:90%
don't know how to do that.

00:20:53.690 --> 00:20:54.814 align:middle line:90%
I never built a PowerPoint.

00:20:54.814 --> 00:20:56.270 align:middle line:90%
I'll go get the coffee.

00:20:56.270 --> 00:20:58.560 align:middle line:84%
But they're watching
someone else do it.

00:20:58.560 --> 00:21:00.870 align:middle line:84%
And modeling, in
my Ph.D. research,

00:21:00.870 --> 00:21:03.736 align:middle line:84%
it was all about what makes
people adopt technology.

00:21:03.736 --> 00:21:05.110 align:middle line:84%
And it's not just
having hardware

00:21:05.110 --> 00:21:06.580 align:middle line:90%
and software and stuff.

00:21:06.580 --> 00:21:07.600 align:middle line:90%
It's modeling.

00:21:07.600 --> 00:21:10.820 align:middle line:84%
And so if a lower level
person in the skills

00:21:10.820 --> 00:21:13.080 align:middle line:84%
can be with somebody
who knows more,

00:21:13.080 --> 00:21:15.900 align:middle line:84%
then they can get
it from modeling.

00:21:15.900 --> 00:21:18.350 align:middle line:84%
But also, a younger person is
going to approach something

00:21:18.350 --> 00:21:22.350 align:middle line:84%
from a more creative, or perhaps
a more inquisitive standpoint,

00:21:22.350 --> 00:21:24.260 align:middle line:90%
or even a colorful, artistic.

00:21:24.260 --> 00:21:25.990 align:middle line:84%
And the older person
can learn that.

00:21:25.990 --> 00:21:28.574 align:middle line:84%
But what we do is take all the
As, all the Bs, all the Cs, all

00:21:28.574 --> 00:21:30.823 align:middle line:84%
the Ds, and put them all in
groups, and then everybody

00:21:30.823 --> 00:21:32.590 align:middle line:84%
sits there and they
can't progress.

00:21:32.590 --> 00:21:36.140 align:middle line:84%
It's natural for
children in a family

00:21:36.140 --> 00:21:41.810 align:middle line:84%
to look up to certain people
and take care of children,

00:21:41.810 --> 00:21:43.250 align:middle line:90%
and everybody has their role.

00:21:43.250 --> 00:21:44.960 align:middle line:84%
And you can switch
out the roles.

00:21:44.960 --> 00:21:47.470 align:middle line:84%
So I think one of the most
damaging things in a classroom

00:21:47.470 --> 00:21:49.640 align:middle line:84%
setting is the fact that
there's only one teacher.

00:21:49.640 --> 00:21:50.223 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:21:50.223 --> 00:21:51.470 align:middle line:90%
Yeah, I agree with that.

00:21:51.470 --> 00:21:54.420 align:middle line:84%
And another thing, too, is
this notion of competition

00:21:54.420 --> 00:21:54.999 align:middle line:90%
that occurs.

00:21:54.999 --> 00:21:56.790 align:middle line:84%
I mean, there becomes
a classroom hierarchy

00:21:56.790 --> 00:21:58.870 align:middle line:84%
in terms of grading
and bell curves.

00:21:58.870 --> 00:22:01.700 align:middle line:84%
In that case, all artists get
left behind, for the most part.

00:22:01.700 --> 00:22:04.527 align:middle line:84%
It's usually the real
sensitives that are working more

00:22:04.527 --> 00:22:06.610 align:middle line:84%
on the right side of the
brain that aren't testing

00:22:06.610 --> 00:22:09.980 align:middle line:84%
out all that well when they may
be the most genius among them.

00:22:09.980 --> 00:22:11.720 align:middle line:84%
And one of the things
in this Waldorf

00:22:11.720 --> 00:22:14.700 align:middle line:84%
system I found
particularly lovely is--

00:22:14.700 --> 00:22:17.810 align:middle line:84%
my son went through the
system-- was his teacher

00:22:17.810 --> 00:22:19.521 align:middle line:84%
would tell the kids
when it was time.

00:22:19.521 --> 00:22:22.020 align:middle line:84%
When they were old enough to
start doing tests-- they really

00:22:22.020 --> 00:22:24.311 align:middle line:84%
don't grade them much until
they're around eighth grade

00:22:24.311 --> 00:22:28.660 align:middle line:84%
or so-- they would tell
the kids, help each other.

00:22:28.660 --> 00:22:29.890 align:middle line:90%
Here's your test.

00:22:29.890 --> 00:22:32.070 align:middle line:90%
Help each other out.

00:22:32.070 --> 00:22:33.790 align:middle line:90%
Elsewhere, it's called cheating.

00:22:33.790 --> 00:22:35.690 align:middle line:84%
But his feeling
was, what is there

00:22:35.690 --> 00:22:38.190 align:middle line:84%
to gain with someone
who's sitting there,

00:22:38.190 --> 00:22:40.190 align:middle line:84%
ignorant, unable to
answer questions.

00:22:40.190 --> 00:22:42.290 align:middle line:84%
Whether they're prepared
or not was irrelevant.

00:22:42.290 --> 00:22:45.839 align:middle line:84%
The point was, he believed that
the morale of the entire class

00:22:45.839 --> 00:22:48.130 align:middle line:84%
and the learning was going
to go to a much higher level

00:22:48.130 --> 00:22:49.437 align:middle line:90%
if you helped each other.

00:22:49.437 --> 00:22:51.020 align:middle line:84%
>>BOULTER: But that's
a model for what

00:22:51.020 --> 00:22:53.500 align:middle line:84%
we should be doing
anyway in life.

00:22:53.500 --> 00:22:57.040 align:middle line:84%
Why should every individual
know everything at 100% level

00:22:57.040 --> 00:22:58.650 align:middle line:90%
when we have a team?

00:22:58.650 --> 00:23:00.940 align:middle line:84%
And so that's
completely appropriate.

00:23:00.940 --> 00:23:03.380 align:middle line:84%
And I do think that helping
each other is a good idea.

00:23:03.380 --> 00:23:06.760 align:middle line:84%
But the minute that you get a
test, the number and the score

00:23:06.760 --> 00:23:08.850 align:middle line:84%
on the test is a
self esteem value.

00:23:08.850 --> 00:23:09.660 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: It is.

00:23:09.660 --> 00:23:11.129 align:middle line:90%
>>BOULTER: You got 70.

00:23:11.129 --> 00:23:12.670 align:middle line:84%
Well, that means
that you're no good.

00:23:12.670 --> 00:23:15.975 align:middle line:84%
So then if thought is creative,
the brain says, yes, boss,

00:23:15.975 --> 00:23:17.294 align:middle line:90%
you're no good.

00:23:17.294 --> 00:23:17.960 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:23:17.960 --> 00:23:19.300 align:middle line:84%
>>BOULTER: So somebody
told you you were no good.

00:23:19.300 --> 00:23:20.770 align:middle line:84%
So then you go and write another
test, and you're no good.

00:23:20.770 --> 00:23:22.319 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Now you
have mass anxiety

00:23:22.319 --> 00:23:23.360 align:middle line:90%
going into the next test.

00:23:23.360 --> 00:23:24.900 align:middle line:84%
>>BOULTER: And then you're
no good, so you give up.

00:23:24.900 --> 00:23:25.230 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:23:25.230 --> 00:23:26.190 align:middle line:84%
>>BOULTER: How many
people give up?

00:23:26.190 --> 00:23:26.800 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:23:26.800 --> 00:23:28.800 align:middle line:84%
>>BOULTER: But the thing
is, is what can you do?

00:23:28.800 --> 00:23:30.950 align:middle line:84%
And so I do not
teach with tests.

00:23:30.950 --> 00:23:32.470 align:middle line:84%
I don't see how
a test is useful.

00:23:32.470 --> 00:23:33.270 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Good for you.

00:23:33.270 --> 00:23:34.720 align:middle line:84%
>>BOULTER: Because
all the students--

00:23:34.720 --> 00:23:35.790 align:middle line:90%
I want them to make something.

00:23:35.790 --> 00:23:36.956 align:middle line:90%
I want them to do a project.

00:23:36.956 --> 00:23:38.250 align:middle line:90%
I want them to speak about it.

00:23:38.250 --> 00:23:39.625 align:middle line:84%
I want them to
become articulate.

00:23:39.625 --> 00:23:40.650 align:middle line:90%
I want them to film.

00:23:40.650 --> 00:23:43.850 align:middle line:84%
I want them to make
something, create it,

00:23:43.850 --> 00:23:45.720 align:middle line:90%
and then it's theirs, right?

00:23:45.720 --> 00:23:47.860 align:middle line:84%
And so that's the
level that I'm going

00:23:47.860 --> 00:23:50.430 align:middle line:84%
to mark them on-- the
energy they put in.

00:23:50.430 --> 00:23:54.840 align:middle line:84%
Not on how good it was,
but how much they grew.

00:23:54.840 --> 00:23:58.220 align:middle line:84%
I was teaching in
Chinese culture in Taiwan

00:23:58.220 --> 00:24:00.560 align:middle line:84%
for four years, and
the students had

00:24:00.560 --> 00:24:02.260 align:middle line:84%
been taking English
for 10 years.

00:24:02.260 --> 00:24:03.510 align:middle line:90%
And they were mute.

00:24:03.510 --> 00:24:05.480 align:middle line:84%
They were so terrified
to ask a question--

00:24:05.480 --> 00:24:05.880 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: To be wrong.

00:24:05.880 --> 00:24:06.670 align:middle line:90%
>>BOULTER: And to be wrong.

00:24:06.670 --> 00:24:08.520 align:middle line:84%
And they were chastised
if they were wrong.

00:24:08.520 --> 00:24:11.250 align:middle line:84%
But the other thing is they
never asked questions or made

00:24:11.250 --> 00:24:11.920 align:middle line:90%
comments.

00:24:11.920 --> 00:24:14.650 align:middle line:84%
And it took me the longest time
to figure out what that was.

00:24:14.650 --> 00:24:18.180 align:middle line:84%
There's a cultural thing
that if you're the teacher,

00:24:18.180 --> 00:24:20.580 align:middle line:84%
and I ask you a
question, I'm telling you

00:24:20.580 --> 00:24:21.795 align:middle line:90%
you didn't teach me well.

00:24:21.795 --> 00:24:23.154 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Oh, I see, yes.

00:24:23.154 --> 00:24:25.570 align:middle line:84%
>>BOULTER: Well, that makes
sense if you look at it there.

00:24:25.570 --> 00:24:28.490 align:middle line:84%
But from our perspective, like,
I'd say, questions, comments?

00:24:28.490 --> 00:24:29.030 align:middle line:90%
Oh, right.

00:24:29.030 --> 00:24:29.639 align:middle line:90%
I'm in Taiwan.

00:24:29.639 --> 00:24:30.430 align:middle line:90%
There won't be any.

00:24:30.430 --> 00:24:33.170 align:middle line:84%
And the students are like, are
we allowed to ask questions?

00:24:33.170 --> 00:24:35.770 align:middle line:84%
And so I've dealt with
many Asian students

00:24:35.770 --> 00:24:37.200 align:middle line:84%
back at the
University of Calgary,

00:24:37.200 --> 00:24:40.469 align:middle line:84%
when I came back from Taiwan,
and they were all the same.

00:24:40.469 --> 00:24:42.010 align:middle line:84%
They were terrified
to ask questions.

00:24:42.010 --> 00:24:43.189 align:middle line:90%
And so I encouraged them.

00:24:43.189 --> 00:24:44.730 align:middle line:84%
And so at the
beginning, there's just

00:24:44.730 --> 00:24:47.510 align:middle line:84%
like a barrage of questions,
because they're lost.

00:24:47.510 --> 00:24:51.320 align:middle line:84%
But once they catch on,
and once they understand,

00:24:51.320 --> 00:24:54.372 align:middle line:84%
they go like rocket ships, and
they're incredibly hardworking.

00:24:54.372 --> 00:24:55.830 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Well,
what a release that

00:24:55.830 --> 00:24:57.880 align:middle line:84%
must be for them to
have the permission

00:24:57.880 --> 00:25:01.370 align:middle line:84%
to participate and be
interactive instead of just one

00:25:01.370 --> 00:25:02.310 align:middle line:90%
way, taught at.

00:25:02.310 --> 00:25:03.310 align:middle line:90%
>>BOULTER: That's right.

00:25:03.310 --> 00:25:06.300 align:middle line:84%
And, see, language learning
became a great interest to me,

00:25:06.300 --> 00:25:08.900 align:middle line:90%
because you can pass the tests.

00:25:08.900 --> 00:25:10.710 align:middle line:84%
You can get the marks
in language learning.

00:25:10.710 --> 00:25:12.185 align:middle line:90%
But you can't order lunch.

00:25:12.185 --> 00:25:13.490 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: There you go.

00:25:13.490 --> 00:25:14.906 align:middle line:84%
>>BOULTER: And
that just shows you

00:25:14.906 --> 00:25:17.370 align:middle line:84%
how much the education
system has failed us.

00:25:17.370 --> 00:25:19.800 align:middle line:84%
So looking through methods of
language teaching, theories

00:25:19.800 --> 00:25:21.517 align:middle line:84%
of language learning,
it's all appealing

00:25:21.517 --> 00:25:22.850 align:middle line:90%
to different parts of the brain.

00:25:22.850 --> 00:25:26.020 align:middle line:84%
But it's not necessarily
appealing to the whole person.

00:25:26.020 --> 00:25:27.780 align:middle line:90%
Interactivity is the key.

00:25:27.780 --> 00:25:29.450 align:middle line:90%
And immediacy of feedback.

00:25:29.450 --> 00:25:32.570 align:middle line:84%
So if you do an exercise and you
get the answers a week later,

00:25:32.570 --> 00:25:34.205 align:middle line:84%
you don't remember
that exercise.

00:25:34.205 --> 00:25:35.220 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: No,
you're already gone.

00:25:35.220 --> 00:25:36.050 align:middle line:90%
It's like training a dog.

00:25:36.050 --> 00:25:36.842 align:middle line:90%
You're out of that.

00:25:36.842 --> 00:25:37.549 align:middle line:90%
>>BOULTER: Right.

00:25:37.549 --> 00:25:38.490 align:middle line:90%
You forget about it.

00:25:38.490 --> 00:25:39.240 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Exactly.

00:25:39.240 --> 00:25:41.370 align:middle line:84%
>>BOULTER: So if, as
you answer the question,

00:25:41.370 --> 00:25:42.930 align:middle line:90%
you see if you're right.

00:25:42.930 --> 00:25:45.670 align:middle line:84%
And then you get a chance
to go back and do it again.

00:25:45.670 --> 00:25:48.830 align:middle line:84%
So the way I set things
up is there's a lesson,

00:25:48.830 --> 00:25:50.350 align:middle line:90%
and then you do the test.

00:25:50.350 --> 00:25:52.440 align:middle line:84%
And you need to
get at least 90%.

00:25:52.440 --> 00:25:54.090 align:middle line:90%
I prefer 100%.

00:25:54.090 --> 00:25:58.070 align:middle line:84%
So if you push submit,
and you got 75%,

00:25:58.070 --> 00:25:59.980 align:middle line:84%
you get taken back
into the lesson.

00:25:59.980 --> 00:26:00.480 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: And that's good.

00:26:00.480 --> 00:26:00.820 align:middle line:90%
That's fair enough.

00:26:00.820 --> 00:26:03.020 align:middle line:84%
>>BOULTER: And then you
keep going around and around

00:26:03.020 --> 00:26:03.610 align:middle line:90%
until you can get 100%.

00:26:03.610 --> 00:26:05.000 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: And it's private.

00:26:05.000 --> 00:26:06.000 align:middle line:90%
>>BOULTER: It's private.

00:26:06.000 --> 00:26:07.430 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: There
is no humiliation.

00:26:07.430 --> 00:26:08.220 align:middle line:90%
>>BOULTER: Nobody knows.

00:26:08.220 --> 00:26:09.020 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: You go
until you learn.

00:26:09.020 --> 00:26:10.436 align:middle line:84%
And we're going
to talk about some

00:26:10.436 --> 00:26:13.180 align:middle line:84%
of the economics of getting
a college education, which

00:26:13.180 --> 00:26:16.250 align:middle line:84%
is really, right now, is
really something close

00:26:16.250 --> 00:26:18.530 align:middle line:84%
to enslavement, as
far as I'm concerned.

00:26:18.530 --> 00:26:21.670 align:middle line:84%
And so before we do that, as
we did in the last segment,

00:26:21.670 --> 00:26:24.260 align:middle line:84%
what I'd like to do is
start out by taking a look

00:26:24.260 --> 00:26:27.640 align:middle line:84%
at another excerpt from
College Conspiracy.

00:26:27.640 --> 00:26:29.860 align:middle line:84%
And this really
addresses the subject

00:26:29.860 --> 00:26:33.240 align:middle line:84%
of what happens when we
all have college degrees.

00:26:33.240 --> 00:26:35.454 align:middle line:90%
OK, let's take a look.

00:26:35.454 --> 00:26:36.204 align:middle line:90%
>>Congratulations.

00:26:36.204 --> 00:26:39.571 align:middle line:90%
[CHEERING]

00:26:39.571 --> 00:26:43.900 align:middle line:90%


00:26:43.900 --> 00:26:47.080 align:middle line:10%
>>As fast as college
tuition costs are rising,

00:26:47.080 --> 00:26:51.600 align:middle line:10%
the value of a college degree
is declining even faster.

00:26:51.600 --> 00:26:53.630 align:middle line:84%
The youth in America
today need to be

00:26:53.630 --> 00:26:56.830 align:middle line:84%
taught to think for themselves
and realize that there

00:26:56.830 --> 00:26:59.200 align:middle line:84%
is no value to having
a college degree

00:26:59.200 --> 00:27:01.962 align:middle line:90%
if everyone else has one.

00:27:01.962 --> 00:27:03.170 align:middle line:90%
>>I was in the Student Union.

00:27:03.170 --> 00:27:05.440 align:middle line:84%
Our graduation was
about to take place.

00:27:05.440 --> 00:27:09.900 align:middle line:84%
And they had a series
of plaques on the wall,

00:27:09.900 --> 00:27:12.130 align:middle line:84%
and they listed all
the students who

00:27:12.130 --> 00:27:16.430 align:middle line:84%
had graduated with a
4.0 grade point average.

00:27:16.430 --> 00:27:21.760 align:middle line:90%


00:27:21.760 --> 00:27:23.930 align:middle line:84%
All the plaques were
basically full of names.

00:27:23.930 --> 00:27:29.970 align:middle line:84%
But the first plaque had
the first 50 or 60 years

00:27:29.970 --> 00:27:32.500 align:middle line:84%
of the university
represented to fill

00:27:32.500 --> 00:27:35.035 align:middle line:84%
that plaque with the
20 or so names on it.

00:27:35.035 --> 00:27:38.570 align:middle line:84%
It required 50 or 60
years of higher education.

00:27:38.570 --> 00:27:41.590 align:middle line:90%


00:27:41.590 --> 00:27:44.060 align:middle line:84%
Of course, in the
most recent 5 years,

00:27:44.060 --> 00:27:47.420 align:middle line:84%
there were multiple
plaques for every year.

00:27:47.420 --> 00:27:51.540 align:middle line:84%
We're churning out 4.0 students
at the rate of a couple

00:27:51.540 --> 00:27:52.510 align:middle line:90%
hundred a year.

00:27:52.510 --> 00:27:55.450 align:middle line:90%
That used to mean something.

00:27:55.450 --> 00:27:59.340 align:middle line:84%
If you're the only person
in the first 40 years

00:27:59.340 --> 00:28:01.850 align:middle line:84%
of the history of the
institution to have a 4.0,

00:28:01.850 --> 00:28:03.270 align:middle line:90%
that's meaningful.

00:28:03.270 --> 00:28:05.080 align:middle line:90%
Now everybody's a 4.0 student.

00:28:05.080 --> 00:28:08.360 align:middle line:84%
Our standards have
fallen so profoundly

00:28:08.360 --> 00:28:13.740 align:middle line:84%
that anybody with a heartbeat
can get a 4.0 average.

00:28:13.740 --> 00:28:15.255 align:middle line:90%
It's just absurd.

00:28:15.255 --> 00:28:17.830 align:middle line:90%


00:28:17.830 --> 00:28:19.650 align:middle line:10%
>>The US Bureau of
Labor Statistics

00:28:19.650 --> 00:28:23.120 align:middle line:10%
reported in April of last
year that, as of October,

00:28:23.120 --> 00:28:28.330 align:middle line:10%
2009, 70.1% of 2009
high school graduates

00:28:28.330 --> 00:28:32.035 align:middle line:10%
were enrolled in colleges or
universities, an all time high

00:28:32.035 --> 00:28:33.840 align:middle line:10%
since they began
keeping this statistic,

00:28:33.840 --> 00:28:39.190 align:middle line:10%
and up from 68.6% of 2008
high school graduates

00:28:39.190 --> 00:28:40.640 align:middle line:10%
enrolling into college.

00:28:40.640 --> 00:28:42.300 align:middle line:84%
In other words,
there's no longer

00:28:42.300 --> 00:28:45.090 align:middle line:84%
anything special about a
college degree in America

00:28:45.090 --> 00:28:48.550 align:middle line:84%
if 70% of everybody else
is also attending college

00:28:48.550 --> 00:28:50.080 align:middle line:90%
to receive one.

00:28:50.080 --> 00:28:53.150 align:middle line:84%
NIA is working hard to
ensure that it will soon

00:28:53.150 --> 00:28:54.955 align:middle line:84%
become common
knowledge in the US

00:28:54.955 --> 00:28:58.060 align:middle line:84%
that a college degree
gives you no advantage

00:28:58.060 --> 00:28:59.950 align:middle line:90%
over the rest of the population.

00:28:59.950 --> 00:29:02.280 align:middle line:84%
When Americans finally
learn the truth,

00:29:02.280 --> 00:29:04.080 align:middle line:84%
the college bubble in
America will burst.

00:29:04.080 --> 00:29:13.300 align:middle line:90%


00:29:13.300 --> 00:29:15.430 align:middle line:10%
>>College enrollment has
been increasing, really,

00:29:15.430 --> 00:29:16.900 align:middle line:10%
since the late '80s.

00:29:16.900 --> 00:29:21.600 align:middle line:10%
But what kind of what is an
unknown secret is since 1992,

00:29:21.600 --> 00:29:25.440 align:middle line:10%
the majority of college
graduates-- 60% of them--

00:29:25.440 --> 00:29:28.120 align:middle line:10%
were in positions that the
BLS considered low skill

00:29:28.120 --> 00:29:31.040 align:middle line:10%
and typically did not require
a high school education.

00:29:31.040 --> 00:29:35.460 align:middle line:84%
For example, 20% of all the new
waiter or waitressing positions

00:29:35.460 --> 00:29:39.440 align:middle line:84%
created since 1992 have been
filled by college graduates.

00:29:39.440 --> 00:29:42.500 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: I would argue
probably higher, just

00:29:42.500 --> 00:29:45.680 align:middle line:84%
based on evidence-- eyewitness
evidence-- probably higher

00:29:45.680 --> 00:29:48.610 align:middle line:84%
than 20% of all the people
in the service industries

00:29:48.610 --> 00:29:50.244 align:middle line:90%
have college degrees.

00:29:50.244 --> 00:29:51.660 align:middle line:84%
I mean, that's
what it's good for.

00:29:51.660 --> 00:29:53.420 align:middle line:90%
That's the joke now, right?

00:29:53.420 --> 00:29:57.050 align:middle line:84%
There's even a burn
your degree movement.

00:29:57.050 --> 00:29:59.061 align:middle line:90%
I saw that on YouTube.

00:29:59.061 --> 00:30:01.010 align:middle line:84%
>>BOULTER: A $30,000
piece of paper

00:30:01.010 --> 00:30:02.310 align:middle line:90%
that you're going to burn.

00:30:02.310 --> 00:30:04.570 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: You're going to
burn, because basically, you

00:30:04.570 --> 00:30:07.840 align:middle line:84%
can't even get a management
position at a restaurant.

00:30:07.840 --> 00:30:10.129 align:middle line:84%
You're still a waiter,
because the jobs aren't there.

00:30:10.129 --> 00:30:12.420 align:middle line:84%
Because you haven't been
trained to do specific things.

00:30:12.420 --> 00:30:14.110 align:middle line:84%
So this brings up
something else,

00:30:14.110 --> 00:30:16.890 align:middle line:84%
and that's the subject of,
before we get into the cost

00:30:16.890 --> 00:30:19.360 align:middle line:84%
aspect of it,
vocational schools.

00:30:19.360 --> 00:30:20.750 align:middle line:90%
What about vocational schools?

00:30:20.750 --> 00:30:21.920 align:middle line:90%
What happened there?

00:30:21.920 --> 00:30:25.347 align:middle line:10%
We need all these different
expressions of trades and arts.

00:30:25.347 --> 00:30:26.930 align:middle line:10%
>>BOULTER: Well,
isn't it interesting?

00:30:26.930 --> 00:30:29.570 align:middle line:84%
Because they were
called blue collar,

00:30:29.570 --> 00:30:32.200 align:middle line:84%
and we were supposed
to be white collar.

00:30:32.200 --> 00:30:33.360 align:middle line:90%
And there were stigmas.

00:30:33.360 --> 00:30:34.689 align:middle line:90%
But now who's making it?

00:30:34.689 --> 00:30:35.480 align:middle line:90%
It's the tradesmen.

00:30:35.480 --> 00:30:36.770 align:middle line:90%
It's the independent plumber.

00:30:36.770 --> 00:30:37.520 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: You bet.

00:30:37.520 --> 00:30:39.270 align:middle line:84%
A plumber is making
more than some lawyers.

00:30:39.270 --> 00:30:39.978 align:middle line:90%
>>BOULTER: Right?

00:30:39.978 --> 00:30:41.380 align:middle line:84%
But they have
their own business.

00:30:41.380 --> 00:30:43.390 align:middle line:10%
And so what isn't
taught in high school

00:30:43.390 --> 00:30:44.590 align:middle line:10%
is how to run a business.

00:30:44.590 --> 00:30:45.910 align:middle line:10%
How to make a business card.

00:30:45.910 --> 00:30:47.440 align:middle line:10%
How to make your own website.

00:30:47.440 --> 00:30:49.320 align:middle line:10%
They keep all that
segregated, and then you

00:30:49.320 --> 00:30:51.760 align:middle line:10%
have to go get a special degree
on how to build a website.

00:30:51.760 --> 00:30:53.330 align:middle line:10%
And you can do it
all, theoretically,

00:30:53.330 --> 00:30:54.960 align:middle line:10%
but do you have a website?

00:30:54.960 --> 00:30:58.420 align:middle line:10%
And so we tend to teach in a
theoretical fashion instead

00:30:58.420 --> 00:31:00.160 align:middle line:10%
of a practical fashion.

00:31:00.160 --> 00:31:03.640 align:middle line:84%
But we're also not having people
do the psychological work--

00:31:03.640 --> 00:31:04.860 align:middle line:90%
the personal inventory.

00:31:04.860 --> 00:31:06.149 align:middle line:90%
Who am I?

00:31:06.149 --> 00:31:08.190 align:middle line:84%
Would I rather stuff
envelopes or ride a bicycle?

00:31:08.190 --> 00:31:09.510 align:middle line:90%
Who am I?

00:31:09.510 --> 00:31:12.510 align:middle line:84%
And so if you were to go to
a college counselor, perhaps,

00:31:12.510 --> 00:31:16.640 align:middle line:84%
or psychological
testing, you may find out

00:31:16.640 --> 00:31:18.910 align:middle line:84%
that you're an
engineer material,

00:31:18.910 --> 00:31:20.860 align:middle line:90%
but you're not a musician.

00:31:20.860 --> 00:31:21.670 align:middle line:90%
You may learn that.

00:31:21.670 --> 00:31:23.310 align:middle line:84%
But that should
also be standard.

00:31:23.310 --> 00:31:24.150 align:middle line:90%
Who are you?

00:31:24.150 --> 00:31:25.733 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: But that
should be something

00:31:25.733 --> 00:31:28.110 align:middle line:84%
that you should have ascertained
in elementary school,

00:31:28.110 --> 00:31:30.370 align:middle line:90%
and certainly middle school.

00:31:30.370 --> 00:31:33.751 align:middle line:84%
We can start seeing
what our passions are,

00:31:33.751 --> 00:31:36.000 align:middle line:84%
our interests are, where our
talents lie from, really,

00:31:36.000 --> 00:31:37.660 align:middle line:84%
a very early age, if
anyone's paying attention.

00:31:37.660 --> 00:31:38.450 align:middle line:90%
But they're not.

00:31:38.450 --> 00:31:40.820 align:middle line:84%
>>BOULTER: Well,
they do do IQ tests.

00:31:40.820 --> 00:31:42.820 align:middle line:84%
But again, that's the
same thing as these tests.

00:31:42.820 --> 00:31:43.570 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Exactly.

00:31:43.570 --> 00:31:48.170 align:middle line:84%
>>BOULTER: Because we know we're
smarter some days than others.

00:31:48.170 --> 00:31:51.560 align:middle line:84%
We know that sometimes our
brains are sharper and not.

00:31:51.560 --> 00:31:53.370 align:middle line:84%
So the day that
you get the test,

00:31:53.370 --> 00:31:56.440 align:middle line:84%
the feeling you have about the
test, about the person doing

00:31:56.440 --> 00:31:59.100 align:middle line:84%
the test, the mood you're
in, affects your IQ.

00:31:59.100 --> 00:32:01.490 align:middle line:84%
But that IQ follows
you for years.

00:32:01.490 --> 00:32:03.287 align:middle line:84%
And it could be you're
superior bright.

00:32:03.287 --> 00:32:03.870 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:32:03.870 --> 00:32:07.780 align:middle line:84%
And going back to what I
was saying a minute ago,

00:32:07.780 --> 00:32:09.980 align:middle line:84%
rather than relying
on that, what

00:32:09.980 --> 00:32:13.810 align:middle line:84%
about a system that allows kids
to start being acknowledged

00:32:13.810 --> 00:32:16.320 align:middle line:84%
for what they're good at and
encouraged in those areas early

00:32:16.320 --> 00:32:16.820 align:middle line:90%
on?

00:32:16.820 --> 00:32:18.528 align:middle line:84%
Which, of course, can
happen in the home,

00:32:18.528 --> 00:32:20.840 align:middle line:84%
but it's not happening through
the educational system.

00:32:20.840 --> 00:32:24.350 align:middle line:84%
And that brings us,
really, to homeschooling.

00:32:24.350 --> 00:32:25.905 align:middle line:84%
Can you talk about
that a little bit?

00:32:25.905 --> 00:32:28.890 align:middle line:84%
>>BOULTER: Well, I've seen
an awful lot of parents,

00:32:28.890 --> 00:32:31.530 align:middle line:84%
particularly where I live
in British Columbia, Canada,

00:32:31.530 --> 00:32:33.410 align:middle line:84%
that just take their
kids out of school.

00:32:33.410 --> 00:32:35.302 align:middle line:84%
The student argues
with the teacher,

00:32:35.302 --> 00:32:37.010 align:middle line:84%
and we were talking
about Egypt, and they

00:32:37.010 --> 00:32:38.940 align:middle line:84%
say the pyramids
were built by slaves,

00:32:38.940 --> 00:32:41.592 align:middle line:84%
and there's mummies
and all that stuff,

00:32:41.592 --> 00:32:42.800 align:middle line:90%
and that pyramids were tombs.

00:32:42.800 --> 00:32:45.342 align:middle line:84%
And I remember this one student,
she argued with the teacher,

00:32:45.342 --> 00:32:47.258 align:middle line:84%
and her mother took her
out of school that day

00:32:47.258 --> 00:32:48.770 align:middle line:90%
and started homeschooling her.

00:32:48.770 --> 00:32:51.150 align:middle line:84%
And there are all kinds
of homeschooling networks.

00:32:51.150 --> 00:32:53.780 align:middle line:84%
But I don't know that they're
supported in a colorful way,

00:32:53.780 --> 00:32:57.440 align:middle line:84%
because the students need to
be able to do social activities

00:32:57.440 --> 00:32:58.910 align:middle line:90%
and move at their own pace.

00:32:58.910 --> 00:33:00.720 align:middle line:84%
But most parents who
homeschool their kids

00:33:00.720 --> 00:33:03.053 align:middle line:84%
will tell you that they can
finish a curriculum in three

00:33:03.053 --> 00:33:05.432 align:middle line:84%
hours, and yet the students
are in school for six hours.

00:33:05.432 --> 00:33:06.890 align:middle line:84%
And what keeps
happening is they're

00:33:06.890 --> 00:33:08.740 align:middle line:84%
waiting for everybody
else to catch up.

00:33:08.740 --> 00:33:10.960 align:middle line:84%
They're being interrupted
by announcements and bells.

00:33:10.960 --> 00:33:13.674 align:middle line:84%
They're being told when to
stand up and sit down and go out

00:33:13.674 --> 00:33:15.340 align:middle line:84%
the hall and everything,
and they're not

00:33:15.340 --> 00:33:18.849 align:middle line:84%
able to sit and develop their
thinking or make something.

00:33:18.849 --> 00:33:20.140 align:middle line:90%
Oh, you have to stop right now.

00:33:20.140 --> 00:33:21.570 align:middle line:90%
Oh, you have to start right now.

00:33:21.570 --> 00:33:23.490 align:middle line:90%
None of that's natural.

00:33:23.490 --> 00:33:26.250 align:middle line:84%
But there's an awful lot
more homeschooling going on.

00:33:26.250 --> 00:33:27.200 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Absolutely.

00:33:27.200 --> 00:33:29.570 align:middle line:84%
And some people are doing
it to avoid inoculations

00:33:29.570 --> 00:33:31.170 align:middle line:84%
and other things, for
example, although they're

00:33:31.170 --> 00:33:33.753 align:middle line:84%
kind of tightening the noose on
that one in the United States.

00:33:33.753 --> 00:33:36.480 align:middle line:84%
But let's talk about the
whole notion of the fact

00:33:36.480 --> 00:33:38.530 align:middle line:84%
that children
themselves are changing.

00:33:38.530 --> 00:33:41.550 align:middle line:84%
It's a different kind of being
that's coming onto the planet

00:33:41.550 --> 00:33:42.050 align:middle line:90%
now.

00:33:42.050 --> 00:33:43.466 align:middle line:84%
>>BOULTER: Well,
and you know what

00:33:43.466 --> 00:33:46.010 align:middle line:84%
happens to those kinds of beings
that are, perhaps, coming in

00:33:46.010 --> 00:33:49.880 align:middle line:84%
with more senses, more
connectivity, more

00:33:49.880 --> 00:33:52.960 align:middle line:84%
intuition, and seeing
right through people.

00:33:52.960 --> 00:33:54.760 align:middle line:84%
They can tell when
people are lying.

00:33:54.760 --> 00:33:55.760 align:middle line:90%
What do we do with them?

00:33:55.760 --> 00:33:56.490 align:middle line:90%
Medicate them.

00:33:56.490 --> 00:33:57.520 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Medicate them.

00:33:57.520 --> 00:33:58.021 align:middle line:90%
Ritalin.

00:33:58.021 --> 00:33:59.895 align:middle line:84%
>>BOULTER: And then
they're hooked on these--

00:33:59.895 --> 00:34:01.089 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Methamphetamines.

00:34:01.089 --> 00:34:02.630 align:middle line:84%
>>BOULTER: They're
hooked after that,

00:34:02.630 --> 00:34:05.130 align:middle line:84%
and their lives are practically
ruined, as far as I can see.

00:34:05.130 --> 00:34:06.620 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Talk about that cycle.

00:34:06.620 --> 00:34:08.460 align:middle line:90%
What happens to those kids?

00:34:08.460 --> 00:34:11.692 align:middle line:84%
They can't keep them on
after the age of 18, right?

00:34:11.692 --> 00:34:12.650 align:middle line:90%
Is that when that ends?

00:34:12.650 --> 00:34:14.010 align:middle line:84%
>>BOULTER: Well, what they
do is they transfer it

00:34:14.010 --> 00:34:15.020 align:middle line:90%
into antidepressants.

00:34:15.020 --> 00:34:15.939 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:34:15.939 --> 00:34:18.570 align:middle line:84%
>>BOULTER: SSRIs
are so dangerous.

00:34:18.570 --> 00:34:19.630 align:middle line:90%
It blows my mind.

00:34:19.630 --> 00:34:21.269 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Explan what SSRIs are.

00:34:21.269 --> 00:34:23.060 align:middle line:84%
>>BOULTER: Well, that's
what is the essence

00:34:23.060 --> 00:34:24.330 align:middle line:90%
of an antidepressant is.

00:34:24.330 --> 00:34:27.790 align:middle line:84%
And what it's doing is it's
stimulating parts of the brain

00:34:27.790 --> 00:34:30.000 align:middle line:84%
and suppressing
parts of the brain.

00:34:30.000 --> 00:34:32.860 align:middle line:84%
And so there's been interviews
with psychiatrists saying,

00:34:32.860 --> 00:34:34.750 align:middle line:84%
well, how young can you
put a child on SSRIs?

00:34:34.750 --> 00:34:37.000 align:middle line:84%
And they're interviewing
them, and they're saying, oh,

00:34:37.000 --> 00:34:38.440 align:middle line:90%
13, 10, 8.

00:34:38.440 --> 00:34:40.949 align:middle line:90%
And the next guy, 6 months.

00:34:40.949 --> 00:34:41.745 align:middle line:90%
In the womb.

00:34:41.745 --> 00:34:42.803 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Ugh.

00:34:42.803 --> 00:34:44.969 align:middle line:84%
>>BOULTER: But the thing
is, you can't get off them.

00:34:44.969 --> 00:34:45.968 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: No, you can't.

00:34:45.968 --> 00:34:46.677 align:middle line:90%
They're addicted.

00:34:46.677 --> 00:34:48.343 align:middle line:84%
>>BOULTER: I'll tell
you something else.

00:34:48.343 --> 00:34:50.600 align:middle line:84%
I spoke to you about
measuring consciousness fields

00:34:50.600 --> 00:34:52.439 align:middle line:90%
and this device that I have.

00:34:52.439 --> 00:34:54.980 align:middle line:84%
There's a stipulation that if
somebody is on antidepressants,

00:34:54.980 --> 00:34:56.812 align:middle line:90%
the machine won't work.

00:34:56.812 --> 00:34:57.520 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Really?

00:34:57.520 --> 00:34:58.710 align:middle line:90%
Now, OK.

00:34:58.710 --> 00:35:00.102 align:middle line:90%
That was in our last interview.

00:35:00.102 --> 00:35:01.560 align:middle line:84%
Talk about the
machine a little bit

00:35:01.560 --> 00:35:03.891 align:middle line:84%
and explain the profundity
of what you've just said.

00:35:03.891 --> 00:35:05.390 align:middle line:84%
>>BOULTER: What the
machine is doing

00:35:05.390 --> 00:35:08.930 align:middle line:84%
is you insert your fingertips
onto a photographic plate.

00:35:08.930 --> 00:35:11.750 align:middle line:84%
A small impulse comes up, and it
measures the photonic emissions

00:35:11.750 --> 00:35:14.840 align:middle line:84%
around your fingers, which
are connected to the nerve

00:35:14.840 --> 00:35:16.930 align:middle line:84%
endings and the end
of the meridians.

00:35:16.930 --> 00:35:19.790 align:middle line:84%
That's logarithmically
recalculated around the body,

00:35:19.790 --> 00:35:21.710 align:middle line:84%
and then you can see
the overall health

00:35:21.710 --> 00:35:25.514 align:middle line:84%
of the person and the emotional
spiritual activity going.

00:35:25.514 --> 00:35:26.680 align:middle line:90%
And it's extremely accurate.

00:35:26.680 --> 00:35:29.330 align:middle line:84%
I mean, I've studied
this for a long time.

00:35:29.330 --> 00:35:33.420 align:middle line:84%
And so when a person
is on antidepressants,

00:35:33.420 --> 00:35:36.150 align:middle line:84%
it's like their auric
field is deadened.

00:35:36.150 --> 00:35:37.764 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Interesting.

00:35:37.764 --> 00:35:39.430 align:middle line:84%
>>BOULTER: But, you
can't come off them.

00:35:39.430 --> 00:35:43.070 align:middle line:84%
If you're on them for 5 years,
it takes 2 and 1/2 years

00:35:43.070 --> 00:35:44.390 align:middle line:90%
to wean yourself off them.

00:35:44.390 --> 00:35:47.101 align:middle line:84%
But all the problems
that you had-- let's say

00:35:47.101 --> 00:35:47.850 align:middle line:90%
you were agitated.

00:35:47.850 --> 00:35:50.735 align:middle line:84%
Let's say you had
some kind of fear

00:35:50.735 --> 00:35:53.430 align:middle line:90%
or pain or psychological stress.

00:35:53.430 --> 00:35:56.410 align:middle line:84%
When you get off them, you've
got that same fear, pain,

00:35:56.410 --> 00:35:59.335 align:middle line:84%
and psychological stress, but
you become less productive.

00:35:59.335 --> 00:36:02.290 align:middle line:84%
And the number of
people that are on them

00:36:02.290 --> 00:36:03.710 align:middle line:90%
is absolutely staggering.

00:36:03.710 --> 00:36:05.840 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: What are
the numbers now?

00:36:05.840 --> 00:36:08.910 align:middle line:84%
>>BOULTER: 60% of all
adults, and counting.

00:36:08.910 --> 00:36:09.890 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Whoa, whoa.

00:36:09.890 --> 00:36:13.410 align:middle line:84%
60% are on some kind
of antidepressant?

00:36:13.410 --> 00:36:15.390 align:middle line:90%
>>BOULTER: Yes.

00:36:15.390 --> 00:36:17.690 align:middle line:90%
That's a fact.

00:36:17.690 --> 00:36:18.945 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: I had no idea.

00:36:18.945 --> 00:36:19.570 align:middle line:90%
>>BOULTER: Yep.

00:36:19.570 --> 00:36:20.830 align:middle line:90%
That's frightening.

00:36:20.830 --> 00:36:22.080 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: That is frightening.

00:36:22.080 --> 00:36:23.000 align:middle line:84%
>>BOULTER: It's
completely frightening.

00:36:23.000 --> 00:36:24.310 align:middle line:90%
And you know what?

00:36:24.310 --> 00:36:26.600 align:middle line:84%
They're addictive,
and so the physicians

00:36:26.600 --> 00:36:28.940 align:middle line:84%
and the psychiatrists
make money forever.

00:36:28.940 --> 00:36:32.320 align:middle line:84%
It's the way they used to
spend $2,000 in advertising

00:36:32.320 --> 00:36:33.990 align:middle line:84%
for every smoker,
because they knew

00:36:33.990 --> 00:36:35.627 align:middle line:84%
they would smoke for
their whole life.

00:36:35.627 --> 00:36:37.960 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: But, you know, it
does something else as well.

00:36:37.960 --> 00:36:40.980 align:middle line:84%
If the parent has already
taken this on board

00:36:40.980 --> 00:36:42.880 align:middle line:84%
and deemed it to
be a reasonable way

00:36:42.880 --> 00:36:46.290 align:middle line:84%
to manage their own
emotions and so forth,

00:36:46.290 --> 00:36:48.500 align:middle line:84%
then it's really
a very short step

00:36:48.500 --> 00:36:50.405 align:middle line:90%
to do the same for your child.

00:36:50.405 --> 00:36:51.030 align:middle line:90%
>>BOULTER: Yes.

00:36:51.030 --> 00:36:54.900 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: It becomes your family
culture, going to the therapist

00:36:54.900 --> 00:36:56.783 align:middle line:90%
and taking antidepressants.

00:36:56.783 --> 00:36:57.710 align:middle line:90%
>>BOULTER: Yes.

00:36:57.710 --> 00:36:58.570 align:middle line:90%
It's horrifying.

00:36:58.570 --> 00:36:59.695 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: It is horrifying.

00:36:59.695 --> 00:37:03.140 align:middle line:84%
It makes me very sad to think
that so many of these really

00:37:03.140 --> 00:37:05.170 align:middle line:84%
beautiful young kids
that are being born

00:37:05.170 --> 00:37:10.015 align:middle line:84%
onto the planet at this time are
being drugged because they have

00:37:10.015 --> 00:37:11.580 align:middle line:84%
ants in their
pants, or they can't

00:37:11.580 --> 00:37:14.407 align:middle line:84%
sit for this kind of
garbage that we're

00:37:14.407 --> 00:37:16.490 align:middle line:84%
trying to stuff into their
little brains when they

00:37:16.490 --> 00:37:18.500 align:middle line:84%
want to be expressing
themselves.

00:37:18.500 --> 00:37:21.770 align:middle line:84%
>>BOULTER: Why should they sit
in a closed-- I say closed air,

00:37:21.770 --> 00:37:25.560 align:middle line:84%
closed brain circulation system,
when they need to be outside?

00:37:25.560 --> 00:37:27.420 align:middle line:84%
Why can't they be doing
something creative?

00:37:27.420 --> 00:37:28.350 align:middle line:90%
But you know why?

00:37:28.350 --> 00:37:30.800 align:middle line:84%
The reason is it's
harder to manage.

00:37:30.800 --> 00:37:33.720 align:middle line:84%
If you've got one teacher, and
you've got 60 children, 40, 30,

00:37:33.720 --> 00:37:36.490 align:middle line:84%
20, however the
schools are organized,

00:37:36.490 --> 00:37:40.519 align:middle line:84%
basically, it's a
position of control.

00:37:40.519 --> 00:37:41.060 align:middle line:90%
I'm the boss.

00:37:41.060 --> 00:37:41.710 align:middle line:90%
You sit down.

00:37:41.710 --> 00:37:43.810 align:middle line:84%
Well, that's-- what's
that training us for.

00:37:43.810 --> 00:37:48.200 align:middle line:84%
That's training us to be in a
society that's controlling us.

00:37:48.200 --> 00:37:50.800 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So now what we
have to do-- our generation

00:37:50.800 --> 00:37:52.405 align:middle line:84%
and the next
generation down who's

00:37:52.405 --> 00:37:55.210 align:middle line:84%
now making these decisions
for their little kids--

00:37:55.210 --> 00:37:59.160 align:middle line:84%
their young children-- we have
been brainwashed into thinking

00:37:59.160 --> 00:38:01.250 align:middle line:84%
that we all need
a college degree.

00:38:01.250 --> 00:38:05.440 align:middle line:84%
We have to get-- Egoically,
we have to get off of that,

00:38:05.440 --> 00:38:07.400 align:middle line:84%
and to give permission
to the children

00:38:07.400 --> 00:38:10.190 align:middle line:84%
to go in these new directions
that you're talking about.

00:38:10.190 --> 00:38:12.490 align:middle line:90%
It really starts with us.

00:38:12.490 --> 00:38:14.310 align:middle line:84%
>>BOULTER: Well, I
say we can surpass

00:38:14.310 --> 00:38:15.890 align:middle line:84%
what you get in
a college degree.

00:38:15.890 --> 00:38:17.140 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Let's talk about it.

00:38:17.140 --> 00:38:21.410 align:middle line:84%
Let's get into the-- what a
college degree-- not a coll--

00:38:21.410 --> 00:38:23.700 align:middle line:84%
a college edu--
what an education,

00:38:23.700 --> 00:38:28.040 align:middle line:84%
a holistic education, would look
like at any level in your life

00:38:28.040 --> 00:38:31.780 align:middle line:84%
through the internet based
platforms you're talking about.

00:38:31.780 --> 00:38:34.730 align:middle line:84%
>>BOULTER: Well, first of all,
an 8-year-old or a 70-year-old

00:38:34.730 --> 00:38:37.970 align:middle line:84%
could be in the same course, and
they can operate at the level

00:38:37.970 --> 00:38:40.690 align:middle line:90%
that they choose to.

00:38:40.690 --> 00:38:42.220 align:middle line:90%
It's a whole different paradigm.

00:38:42.220 --> 00:38:45.480 align:middle line:84%
But what is important to
me is cross disciplinary.

00:38:45.480 --> 00:38:50.350 align:middle line:84%
So I talk about culturally
inclusive, multimedia,

00:38:50.350 --> 00:38:53.410 align:middle line:90%
interactive, online curriculum.

00:38:53.410 --> 00:38:54.400 align:middle line:90%
OK?

00:38:54.400 --> 00:38:58.200 align:middle line:84%
And teaching academic writing,
teaching research skills,

00:38:58.200 --> 00:38:59.720 align:middle line:90%
even to a kid.

00:38:59.720 --> 00:39:00.760 align:middle line:90%
How you collect data.

00:39:00.760 --> 00:39:01.950 align:middle line:90%
All these different things.

00:39:01.950 --> 00:39:06.100 align:middle line:84%
And then to go out in a
multi-disciplinary setting

00:39:06.100 --> 00:39:08.870 align:middle line:84%
and come up with a hypothesis
and do some testing.

00:39:08.870 --> 00:39:11.189 align:middle line:90%
Film something.

00:39:11.189 --> 00:39:12.480 align:middle line:90%
Look at the progress of people.

00:39:12.480 --> 00:39:14.500 align:middle line:84%
So there's character
development.

00:39:14.500 --> 00:39:17.650 align:middle line:84%
I always like a movie that's
got good character development.

00:39:17.650 --> 00:39:18.850 align:middle line:90%
So where do you see that?

00:39:18.850 --> 00:39:21.480 align:middle line:84%
And so there's different
ways to structure courses

00:39:21.480 --> 00:39:25.310 align:middle line:84%
that allows for students to be
using a multiplicity of skills

00:39:25.310 --> 00:39:27.770 align:middle line:84%
that they develop
in every course.

00:39:27.770 --> 00:39:30.350 align:middle line:84%
Now, I also think there needs
to be parallel structure.

00:39:30.350 --> 00:39:33.849 align:middle line:84%
So across the board,
in an environment--

00:39:33.849 --> 00:39:35.140 align:middle line:90%
an online learning environment.

00:39:35.140 --> 00:39:38.410 align:middle line:84%
You can't be asking different
things in different courses.

00:39:38.410 --> 00:39:40.080 align:middle line:90%
This is the format we're using.

00:39:40.080 --> 00:39:42.380 align:middle line:84%
This is the program
we use for this.

00:39:42.380 --> 00:39:43.860 align:middle line:90%
And everything is the same.

00:39:43.860 --> 00:39:46.980 align:middle line:84%
So as they move between
courses, they take their skills

00:39:46.980 --> 00:39:48.790 align:middle line:84%
with them, and they
develop on those.

00:39:48.790 --> 00:39:50.980 align:middle line:84%
And they can even take
their project with them

00:39:50.980 --> 00:39:52.450 align:middle line:90%
and make it more colorful.

00:39:52.450 --> 00:39:54.040 align:middle line:84%
So instead of having
still pictures,

00:39:54.040 --> 00:39:55.999 align:middle line:84%
they put in little video
clips or something.

00:39:55.999 --> 00:39:58.540 align:middle line:84%
And they just keep on making it
better and better and better.

00:39:58.540 --> 00:40:01.060 align:middle line:84%
Well, I've seen this
in action, because I've

00:40:01.060 --> 00:40:03.050 align:middle line:90%
taught this way for a long time.

00:40:03.050 --> 00:40:05.850 align:middle line:84%
And they told me I could
only give one A plus.

00:40:05.850 --> 00:40:11.750 align:middle line:84%
Well, if I have 12 students that
are absolutely dazzling that

00:40:11.750 --> 00:40:14.830 align:middle line:84%
are creating things that
are better than I created,

00:40:14.830 --> 00:40:17.264 align:middle line:84%
I don't see why I can't
give them all an A plus.

00:40:17.264 --> 00:40:19.680 align:middle line:84%
But then these students turn
around and they can teach it.

00:40:19.680 --> 00:40:21.499 align:middle line:84%
So it's just this
incredible environment.

00:40:21.499 --> 00:40:24.040 align:middle line:84%
The other thing is if you can
post examples of other people's

00:40:24.040 --> 00:40:26.360 align:middle line:90%
work, everybody does better.

00:40:26.360 --> 00:40:29.250 align:middle line:84%
And then next semester,
they do better than that.

00:40:29.250 --> 00:40:32.490 align:middle line:84%
So you've got these
people who are filmmakers,

00:40:32.490 --> 00:40:35.710 align:middle line:84%
who are musicians, who are
recording what they can do,

00:40:35.710 --> 00:40:38.980 align:middle line:84%
and it's incredible, because
you give them something

00:40:38.980 --> 00:40:40.500 align:middle line:90%
that they can take away.

00:40:40.500 --> 00:40:42.811 align:middle line:84%
So in Taiwan, when I was
teaching at the college,

00:40:42.811 --> 00:40:44.060 align:middle line:90%
these students couldn't write.

00:40:44.060 --> 00:40:45.100 align:middle line:90%
They couldn't do anything.

00:40:45.100 --> 00:40:46.880 align:middle line:84%
And the other thing is
that I'm on their team,

00:40:46.880 --> 00:40:48.600 align:middle line:84%
so they would hand
me a one page essay

00:40:48.600 --> 00:40:50.359 align:middle line:90%
that would have 50 mistakes.

00:40:50.359 --> 00:40:51.900 align:middle line:84%
I would correct
every single mistake,

00:40:51.900 --> 00:40:53.524 align:middle line:84%
and I would ask them
to write it again.

00:40:53.524 --> 00:40:55.522 align:middle line:84%
And it would come back
to me with 30 mistakes.

00:40:55.522 --> 00:40:56.730 align:middle line:90%
And I corrected it all again.

00:40:56.730 --> 00:40:58.750 align:middle line:84%
And all of a sudden,
they're like, oh.

00:40:58.750 --> 00:41:02.060 align:middle line:84%
She gave me the answer, and
I wasn't paying attention.

00:41:02.060 --> 00:41:03.820 align:middle line:90%
Because they're asleep.

00:41:03.820 --> 00:41:06.096 align:middle line:84%
They don't even know
how to pay attention.

00:41:06.096 --> 00:41:07.470 align:middle line:84%
After that, they
know it probably

00:41:07.470 --> 00:41:10.010 align:middle line:90%
took me an hour to mark these.

00:41:10.010 --> 00:41:11.800 align:middle line:84%
And then they
carefully write it out,

00:41:11.800 --> 00:41:14.594 align:middle line:84%
and they decorate it and
put it into a format,

00:41:14.594 --> 00:41:15.760 align:middle line:90%
and then they give it to me.

00:41:15.760 --> 00:41:16.920 align:middle line:90%
And they do 10 of these.

00:41:16.920 --> 00:41:20.170 align:middle line:84%
Well, then I give them back
a book of their writing

00:41:20.170 --> 00:41:21.660 align:middle line:90%
that's perfect.

00:41:21.660 --> 00:41:24.300 align:middle line:90%
Well, you're looking at that.

00:41:24.300 --> 00:41:26.379 align:middle line:84%
They try to say, well,
I still can't write.

00:41:26.379 --> 00:41:27.170 align:middle line:90%
But they've got it.

00:41:27.170 --> 00:41:27.520 align:middle line:90%
>>BOULTER: But they've done it.

00:41:27.520 --> 00:41:27.925 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

00:41:27.925 --> 00:41:29.610 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: They've done it,
and they did it themselves.

00:41:29.610 --> 00:41:31.776 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And you've given
them not only validation,

00:41:31.776 --> 00:41:33.590 align:middle line:84%
but through this
process, and the process

00:41:33.590 --> 00:41:35.548 align:middle line:84%
you were talking about
earlier with these kids,

00:41:35.548 --> 00:41:37.800 align:middle line:84%
because they've selected
what they're studying,

00:41:37.800 --> 00:41:40.030 align:middle line:84%
this means there's meaning
to what they're doing.

00:41:40.030 --> 00:41:42.390 align:middle line:84%
There's purpose to
what they're doing.

00:41:42.390 --> 00:41:44.180 align:middle line:84%
And this is something
I know-- and there's

00:41:44.180 --> 00:41:45.479 align:middle line:90%
a wonderful little film.

00:41:45.479 --> 00:41:46.770 align:middle line:90%
I don't know if you've seen it.

00:41:46.770 --> 00:41:48.950 align:middle line:90%
RSA Animate Film.

00:41:48.950 --> 00:41:53.950 align:middle line:84%
It's about changing education
by Sir Ken Robinson.

00:41:53.950 --> 00:41:56.230 align:middle line:84%
And if you have a chance,
by the way, anybody,

00:41:56.230 --> 00:41:59.490 align:middle line:84%
try to find that RSA Animate,
Sir Ken Robinson, on education

00:41:59.490 --> 00:41:59.990 align:middle line:90%
on YouTube.

00:41:59.990 --> 00:42:01.400 align:middle line:90%
It's a great little film.

00:42:01.400 --> 00:42:05.530 align:middle line:10%
And toward the end, it says,
what came out of all this?

00:42:05.530 --> 00:42:08.530 align:middle line:84%
The real understanding in
research is you have to--

00:42:08.530 --> 00:42:10.560 align:middle line:84%
and this is for
workers, for kids--

00:42:10.560 --> 00:42:12.630 align:middle line:84%
there has to be
meaning and purpose.

00:42:12.630 --> 00:42:16.170 align:middle line:84%
The system now completely
lacks meaning and purpose.

00:42:16.170 --> 00:42:18.420 align:middle line:84%
So you're giving
anyone-- doesn't matter

00:42:18.420 --> 00:42:21.520 align:middle line:84%
what their area of
interest is-- education

00:42:21.520 --> 00:42:24.670 align:middle line:84%
becomes meaningful and
purposeful to them.

00:42:24.670 --> 00:42:27.130 align:middle line:84%
>>BOULTER: But an
opportunity for success.

00:42:27.130 --> 00:42:29.280 align:middle line:84%
So translating from
these students who

00:42:29.280 --> 00:42:31.820 align:middle line:84%
are learning English into
a university setting, what

00:42:31.820 --> 00:42:34.635 align:middle line:84%
I would do is somebody
would write a paper,

00:42:34.635 --> 00:42:36.010 align:middle line:84%
and I would
highlight where there

00:42:36.010 --> 00:42:39.690 align:middle line:84%
was a mistake in formatting
and academic writing style.

00:42:39.690 --> 00:42:42.040 align:middle line:84%
And then I'd put
a flag with a link

00:42:42.040 --> 00:42:44.730 align:middle line:84%
to a video tutorial that
gives the answer of what

00:42:44.730 --> 00:42:46.560 align:middle line:84%
the problem is,
that gives a lesson.

00:42:46.560 --> 00:42:48.880 align:middle line:84%
So they'd have all these
flags, and at first they'd

00:42:48.880 --> 00:42:50.870 align:middle line:84%
look at their paper and
maybe be overwhelmed.

00:42:50.870 --> 00:42:53.570 align:middle line:84%
But the real learning
in the whole course

00:42:53.570 --> 00:42:55.620 align:middle line:84%
is the amount of time
it takes to go through.

00:42:55.620 --> 00:42:57.500 align:middle line:84%
And it would take
them as long as it

00:42:57.500 --> 00:43:00.600 align:middle line:84%
would take me to write
it-- to correct it.

00:43:00.600 --> 00:43:03.600 align:middle line:84%
But if there was something
that I didn't have a flag for,

00:43:03.600 --> 00:43:06.290 align:middle line:84%
I would take time and
make a video tutorial.

00:43:06.290 --> 00:43:10.710 align:middle line:84%
And so even with questions
that somebody emailed me,

00:43:10.710 --> 00:43:12.630 align:middle line:84%
if it was a good question,
I could spend a day

00:43:12.630 --> 00:43:15.360 align:middle line:84%
answering that question,
making video tutorials

00:43:15.360 --> 00:43:16.352 align:middle line:90%
and making scaffolding.

00:43:16.352 --> 00:43:18.560 align:middle line:84%
Because what's happening if
somebody has a question--

00:43:18.560 --> 00:43:20.540 align:middle line:84%
I say they're
missing scaffolding.

00:43:20.540 --> 00:43:25.660 align:middle line:84%
They don't have the branch
to put the answer on.

00:43:25.660 --> 00:43:29.170 align:middle line:84%
And so then I always ask them
to post to Q and A with Dr. B.

00:43:29.170 --> 00:43:31.650 align:middle line:84%
And so I say, before
you ask me a question,

00:43:31.650 --> 00:43:33.931 align:middle line:84%
read Q and A with
Dr. B. And then

00:43:33.931 --> 00:43:36.180 align:middle line:84%
I started getting fewer and
fewer and fewer questions.

00:43:36.180 --> 00:43:39.380 align:middle line:84%
But if I got a question, I
could take the time to answer.

00:43:39.380 --> 00:43:41.680 align:middle line:84%
So this parallel
structure means that there

00:43:41.680 --> 00:43:47.450 align:middle line:84%
are resources-- banks of
resources-- for everything.

00:43:47.450 --> 00:43:49.720 align:middle line:84%
And the student takes
the time to go through it

00:43:49.720 --> 00:43:50.900 align:middle line:90%
at their own pace.

00:43:50.900 --> 00:43:53.940 align:middle line:84%
And if they get stumped,
I'm on their team,

00:43:53.940 --> 00:43:55.040 align:middle line:90%
and I can help them.

00:43:55.040 --> 00:43:58.060 align:middle line:84%
And if they have a question,
someone else has that question.

00:43:58.060 --> 00:44:01.770 align:middle line:84%
And so over time, you end up
with this incredible resource.

00:44:01.770 --> 00:44:04.000 align:middle line:84%
And then people become
more and more independent

00:44:04.000 --> 00:44:05.130 align:middle line:90%
and more efficient.

00:44:05.130 --> 00:44:08.420 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: It just makes a lot
of sense in every respect.

00:44:08.420 --> 00:44:09.860 align:middle line:84%
But let's talk
about-- some people

00:44:09.860 --> 00:44:12.240 align:middle line:84%
may be listening right
now and thinking, yeah,

00:44:12.240 --> 00:44:14.475 align:middle line:84%
but what if you want
to become a doctor?

00:44:14.475 --> 00:44:16.520 align:middle line:84%
How are you going
to do that online?

00:44:16.520 --> 00:44:18.900 align:middle line:84%
Don't you still have to go
through the same process?

00:44:18.900 --> 00:44:21.760 align:middle line:84%
Don't you have to go through
the systems of higher education,

00:44:21.760 --> 00:44:24.676 align:middle line:84%
and then into your
residency, and on and on?

00:44:24.676 --> 00:44:26.050 align:middle line:84%
>>BOULTER: Well,
I don't know who

00:44:26.050 --> 00:44:28.174 align:middle line:84%
would want to become a
doctor in this system that's

00:44:28.174 --> 00:44:29.330 align:middle line:90%
just a drug peddler.

00:44:29.330 --> 00:44:30.940 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Well,
that's a second story.

00:44:30.940 --> 00:44:32.148 align:middle line:90%
>>BOULTER: But you know what?

00:44:32.148 --> 00:44:34.590 align:middle line:84%
If that's what they want
to do, that system exists.

00:44:34.590 --> 00:44:35.640 align:middle line:90%
That's the old system.

00:44:35.640 --> 00:44:35.970 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:44:35.970 --> 00:44:37.636 align:middle line:84%
>>BOULTER: I don't
want to be creating--

00:44:37.636 --> 00:44:39.275 align:middle line:84%
I mean, if it supports
the old system,

00:44:39.275 --> 00:44:40.650 align:middle line:84%
I'm not exactly
interested in it.

00:44:40.650 --> 00:44:41.316 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:44:41.316 --> 00:44:44.295 align:middle line:84%
So basically, you're talking
about just saying, I unplug.

00:44:44.295 --> 00:44:45.880 align:middle line:90%
I'm unplugging from the system.

00:44:45.880 --> 00:44:47.980 align:middle line:84%
I'm going to make my own
way, create my own life,

00:44:47.980 --> 00:44:51.050 align:middle line:84%
create my own collaborations
and partnerships

00:44:51.050 --> 00:44:52.740 align:middle line:90%
and opportunities in the future.

00:44:52.740 --> 00:44:55.429 align:middle line:84%
I mean, if you start down that
road of self-responsibility,

00:44:55.429 --> 00:44:57.220 align:middle line:84%
you get to live that
the rest of your life,

00:44:57.220 --> 00:44:58.970 align:middle line:84%
but you have to
learn how to do that.

00:44:58.970 --> 00:45:01.530 align:middle line:84%
And those are the skills
we've yet to have been taught.

00:45:01.530 --> 00:45:04.580 align:middle line:84%
>>BOULTER: And we've got
12 faculties and 42 courses

00:45:04.580 --> 00:45:08.450 align:middle line:84%
so far on Interactive U,
and it is about who are you?

00:45:08.450 --> 00:45:09.380 align:middle line:10%
What can you do?

00:45:09.380 --> 00:45:10.920 align:middle line:10%
How can you present yourself?

00:45:10.920 --> 00:45:13.045 align:middle line:10%
The other thing is you're
going to present yourself

00:45:13.045 --> 00:45:14.010 align:middle line:10%
to an employer.

00:45:14.010 --> 00:45:15.930 align:middle line:10%
Why do you stand apart?

00:45:15.930 --> 00:45:18.100 align:middle line:10%
And so there can be electronic
portfolios that say,

00:45:18.100 --> 00:45:20.130 align:middle line:10%
this person actually built this.

00:45:20.130 --> 00:45:21.840 align:middle line:84%
So as an employer,
would you rather

00:45:21.840 --> 00:45:24.829 align:middle line:84%
have somebody come in to say,
here's a diploma on website

00:45:24.829 --> 00:45:27.245 align:middle line:84%
building, or would you rather
have an electronic portfolio

00:45:27.245 --> 00:45:30.254 align:middle line:84%
to say, here's a website
this person built, right?

00:45:30.254 --> 00:45:30.920 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:45:30.920 --> 00:45:33.110 align:middle line:84%
>>BOULTER: You tell me
which one is more useful.

00:45:33.110 --> 00:45:34.110 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:45:34.110 --> 00:45:36.290 align:middle line:84%
>>BOULTER: And if a student
can conduct research,

00:45:36.290 --> 00:45:39.570 align:middle line:84%
can write academically, can
do all these different skills,

00:45:39.570 --> 00:45:43.770 align:middle line:84%
they understand cross
systems and all of this,

00:45:43.770 --> 00:45:44.904 align:middle line:90%
why wouldn't you hire them?

00:45:44.904 --> 00:45:45.570 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:45:45.570 --> 00:45:47.570 align:middle line:84%
>>BOULTER: But the other thing
is if they don't hire you,

00:45:47.570 --> 00:45:49.361 align:middle line:84%
this person can stand
on their own two feet

00:45:49.361 --> 00:45:50.670 align:middle line:90%
and employ themselves.

00:45:50.670 --> 00:45:52.030 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: That's the difference.

00:45:52.030 --> 00:45:54.937 align:middle line:84%
I mean, you really are creating
a type of self empowerment

00:45:54.937 --> 00:45:55.770 align:middle line:90%
through this system.

00:45:55.770 --> 00:45:56.770 align:middle line:90%
>>BOULTER: That's right.

00:45:56.770 --> 00:46:00.060 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: How do you speak
to the fears of the parents?

00:46:00.060 --> 00:46:02.030 align:middle line:84%
I want to go back to
that, because people

00:46:02.030 --> 00:46:03.170 align:middle line:90%
are listening right now.

00:46:03.170 --> 00:46:06.990 align:middle line:84%
They have their kid all lined up
to get them into whatever prep

00:46:06.990 --> 00:46:08.630 align:middle line:84%
school so that
they can get, just

00:46:08.630 --> 00:46:11.210 align:middle line:84%
like the opening of the
show, into the best college

00:46:11.210 --> 00:46:13.620 align:middle line:84%
and have the best opportunity
at graduate school.

00:46:13.620 --> 00:46:15.040 align:middle line:84%
How do you appeal
to their fears?

00:46:15.040 --> 00:46:18.265 align:middle line:84%
Because oftentimes, if they
were to query their own child,

00:46:18.265 --> 00:46:20.640 align:middle line:84%
they're not necessarily on
board with the parents' agenda

00:46:20.640 --> 00:46:21.149 align:middle line:90%
at all.

00:46:21.149 --> 00:46:22.440 align:middle line:90%
>>BOULTER: Well, you know what?

00:46:22.440 --> 00:46:24.731 align:middle line:84%
If the parents think the
students should go over there,

00:46:24.731 --> 00:46:25.744 align:middle line:90%
go.

00:46:25.744 --> 00:46:27.910 align:middle line:84%
I'm not trying to convince
anybody to come this way.

00:46:27.910 --> 00:46:30.740 align:middle line:84%
I'm picking up all the people
that got dropped in the ditch,

00:46:30.740 --> 00:46:31.546 align:middle line:90%
you know?

00:46:31.546 --> 00:46:35.670 align:middle line:84%
That it didn't work for, and
that don't need convincing.

00:46:35.670 --> 00:46:39.160 align:middle line:84%
Because there's a lot of people
that are interested in this.

00:46:39.160 --> 00:46:42.321 align:middle line:84%
So we'll leave it, like I
said, if the parents think

00:46:42.321 --> 00:46:44.820 align:middle line:84%
that the student's just going
to be sitting at the computer,

00:46:44.820 --> 00:46:47.399 align:middle line:84%
they don't realize
the use of technology.

00:46:47.399 --> 00:46:48.940 align:middle line:84%
I don't even know
how to answer that.

00:46:48.940 --> 00:46:50.640 align:middle line:90%
If they're afraid, go away.

00:46:50.640 --> 00:46:51.306 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:46:51.306 --> 00:46:52.430 align:middle line:90%
You're not talking to them.

00:46:52.430 --> 00:46:53.130 align:middle line:84%
>>BOULTER: I'm not
talking to them.

00:46:53.130 --> 00:46:53.890 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: OK, very good.

00:46:53.890 --> 00:46:56.560 align:middle line:84%
>>BOULTER: OK, let's talk a
little bit about Interactive U.

00:46:56.560 --> 00:47:00.940 align:middle line:84%
How it works, what the
breadth of subjects are,

00:47:00.940 --> 00:47:02.540 align:middle line:84%
and when it's going
to be available

00:47:02.540 --> 00:47:04.480 align:middle line:84%
and all of that for
a little bit here.

00:47:04.480 --> 00:47:06.310 align:middle line:84%
We have some time
to talk about it.

00:47:06.310 --> 00:47:07.480 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Thank you.

00:47:07.480 --> 00:47:09.710 align:middle line:84%
Well, I started working
on this about a year ago,

00:47:09.710 --> 00:47:13.455 align:middle line:84%
and I started the
first online course

00:47:13.455 --> 00:47:16.400 align:middle line:84%
that they had at this
university in Taiwan.

00:47:16.400 --> 00:47:18.320 align:middle line:84%
And I was working on an
international academic

00:47:18.320 --> 00:47:21.210 align:middle line:84%
cooperation project with
the Ministry of Education

00:47:21.210 --> 00:47:21.850 align:middle line:90%
in Taiwan.

00:47:21.850 --> 00:47:24.380 align:middle line:84%
And I actually worked on
three of those projects,

00:47:24.380 --> 00:47:25.810 align:middle line:90%
and I was project leader.

00:47:25.810 --> 00:47:29.490 align:middle line:84%
And so because I was developing
all these online courses,

00:47:29.490 --> 00:47:31.780 align:middle line:84%
I developed a
methodology for it.

00:47:31.780 --> 00:47:34.030 align:middle line:84%
But what I notice is
that the platforms

00:47:34.030 --> 00:47:36.770 align:middle line:84%
that they were using where
you could pay $10,000 a month

00:47:36.770 --> 00:47:41.800 align:middle line:84%
to use Blackboard or Elluminate
and those various coined

00:47:41.800 --> 00:47:44.472 align:middle line:84%
platforms were
actually inferior.

00:47:44.472 --> 00:47:45.680 align:middle line:90%
They weren't colorful enough.

00:47:45.680 --> 00:47:48.405 align:middle line:84%
I couldn't insert videos, I
couldn't use different colors,

00:47:48.405 --> 00:47:50.030 align:middle line:84%
because I always like
the courses to be

00:47:50.030 --> 00:47:52.720 align:middle line:84%
color coded, and
that sort of thing.

00:47:52.720 --> 00:47:56.150 align:middle line:90%
So I decided to build my own.

00:47:56.150 --> 00:48:00.530 align:middle line:84%
And so I worked with an
IT person from the UK,

00:48:00.530 --> 00:48:03.070 align:middle line:84%
and he actually had worked
for the UN for seven years

00:48:03.070 --> 00:48:04.760 align:middle line:90%
and the CIA for five years.

00:48:04.760 --> 00:48:05.930 align:middle line:90%
Brilliant guy.

00:48:05.930 --> 00:48:08.020 align:middle line:90%
And it was all about encryption.

00:48:08.020 --> 00:48:08.950 align:middle line:90%
Well, part of it.

00:48:08.950 --> 00:48:10.407 align:middle line:90%
That was what he understood.

00:48:10.407 --> 00:48:12.990 align:middle line:84%
Because I want to be able to do
streaming video that you can't

00:48:12.990 --> 00:48:16.260 align:middle line:84%
put it on YouTube, and to
keep something proprietary

00:48:16.260 --> 00:48:18.540 align:middle line:84%
within Interactive U that's
just for the students

00:48:18.540 --> 00:48:19.980 align:middle line:90%
that's useful to them.

00:48:19.980 --> 00:48:23.390 align:middle line:90%
And so we developed this system.

00:48:23.390 --> 00:48:25.140 align:middle line:84%
And so it's got all
the discussion boards.

00:48:25.140 --> 00:48:28.140 align:middle line:84%
It's got pages that are
like Facebook pages.

00:48:28.140 --> 00:48:30.890 align:middle line:84%
I'm renaming everything and
needing a new vocabulary

00:48:30.890 --> 00:48:32.390 align:middle line:84%
as we're getting
ready to launch.

00:48:32.390 --> 00:48:34.300 align:middle line:84%
But each student
will have the courses

00:48:34.300 --> 00:48:37.040 align:middle line:84%
they took, the
resources that they--

00:48:37.040 --> 00:48:39.200 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And it starts
at what age level?

00:48:39.200 --> 00:48:40.410 align:middle line:90%
>>BOULTER: I don't care.

00:48:40.410 --> 00:48:41.730 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Anyone who
can access a computer

00:48:41.730 --> 00:48:43.100 align:middle line:84%
and know how to
utilize a computer?

00:48:43.100 --> 00:48:43.480 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:48:43.480 --> 00:48:44.479 align:middle line:90%
>>BOULTER: No age limit.

00:48:44.479 --> 00:48:45.470 align:middle line:90%
You can be 8 or 80.

00:48:45.470 --> 00:48:48.329 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Can this become part
of a homeschooling program

00:48:48.329 --> 00:48:49.870 align:middle line:84%
as well, so it's
integrated that way?

00:48:49.870 --> 00:48:50.940 align:middle line:90%
>>BOULTER: And it's coordinated.

00:48:50.940 --> 00:48:53.115 align:middle line:84%
And actually, I wasn't
thinking about homeschooling

00:48:53.115 --> 00:48:53.740 align:middle line:90%
when I started.

00:48:53.740 --> 00:48:56.580 align:middle line:84%
I was thinking of an online
university and social action

00:48:56.580 --> 00:48:57.080 align:middle line:90%
network.

00:48:57.080 --> 00:48:58.860 align:middle line:84%
Online learning and
social action network.

00:48:58.860 --> 00:49:01.110 align:middle line:84%
But pretty much everybody I
mentioned it to said, what

00:49:01.110 --> 00:49:01.830 align:middle line:90%
about my kids?

00:49:01.830 --> 00:49:02.510 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:49:02.510 --> 00:49:03.968 align:middle line:84%
>>BOULTER: And so
there's no reason

00:49:03.968 --> 00:49:07.070 align:middle line:84%
why that can't be from
K to 12 and all of that.

00:49:07.070 --> 00:49:08.875 align:middle line:84%
And so that's another
issue in terms

00:49:08.875 --> 00:49:11.000 align:middle line:84%
of whether they're going
to pass standardized tests

00:49:11.000 --> 00:49:13.250 align:middle line:84%
and try to get into the
system later and all of that.

00:49:13.250 --> 00:49:15.072 align:middle line:84%
And so this is
extremely complicated.

00:49:15.072 --> 00:49:16.530 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: These
are things that one

00:49:16.530 --> 00:49:17.821 align:middle line:90%
has to take into consideration.

00:49:17.821 --> 00:49:20.004 align:middle line:84%
You either go the new
path or you stay the old.

00:49:20.004 --> 00:49:21.545 align:middle line:84%
>>BOULTER: But
they'll be consulting,

00:49:21.545 --> 00:49:23.462 align:middle line:84%
and there's ways that
you can learn that.

00:49:23.462 --> 00:49:24.420 align:middle line:90%
But back to the system.

00:49:24.420 --> 00:49:25.670 align:middle line:90%
Everybody will have their own.

00:49:25.670 --> 00:49:27.310 align:middle line:84%
It's Facebook meets
LinkedIn meets

00:49:27.310 --> 00:49:29.955 align:middle line:84%
iTunes meets YouTube in
an Interactive U context.

00:49:29.955 --> 00:49:30.580 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:49:30.580 --> 00:49:32.010 align:middle line:90%
Sounds like a fun school to me.

00:49:32.010 --> 00:49:32.935 align:middle line:90%
>>BOULTER: It sounds really fun.

00:49:32.935 --> 00:49:33.500 align:middle line:90%
Exactly.

00:49:33.500 --> 00:49:35.537 align:middle line:84%
And so people are used
to that sort of thing.

00:49:35.537 --> 00:49:36.620 align:middle line:90%
So they can post pictures.

00:49:36.620 --> 00:49:37.828 align:middle line:90%
They can post their projects.

00:49:37.828 --> 00:49:39.150 align:middle line:90%
They can friend somebody.

00:49:39.150 --> 00:49:41.300 align:middle line:84%
So the important
thing to me-- it's

00:49:41.300 --> 00:49:44.640 align:middle line:84%
not just about learning and
information and knowledge.

00:49:44.640 --> 00:49:46.450 align:middle line:90%
It's about action.

00:49:46.450 --> 00:49:48.550 align:middle line:84%
Once you know something,
what are you going to do?

00:49:48.550 --> 00:49:50.890 align:middle line:84%
And so maybe there's going to
be projects-- third world--

00:49:50.890 --> 00:49:52.150 align:middle line:84%
projects in third
world countries

00:49:52.150 --> 00:49:53.941 align:middle line:84%
where they're getting
a stove for everyone,

00:49:53.941 --> 00:49:55.975 align:middle line:84%
or doing an
orphanage in Bolivia,

00:49:55.975 --> 00:49:57.350 align:middle line:84%
and there's people
on the ground.

00:49:57.350 --> 00:49:59.540 align:middle line:84%
It's all video driven, which
is what we're looking at.

00:49:59.540 --> 00:50:00.831 align:middle line:90%
Everybody's looking at YouTube.

00:50:00.831 --> 00:50:04.199 align:middle line:84%
Many people would prefer to do
YouTube than read, even now.

00:50:04.199 --> 00:50:05.740 align:middle line:84%
So if you can't beat
them, join them.

00:50:05.740 --> 00:50:07.770 align:middle line:84%
And so there's somebody on
the ground taking video down

00:50:07.770 --> 00:50:09.510 align:middle line:84%
in Bolivia, and
there's a team here,

00:50:09.510 --> 00:50:11.444 align:middle line:84%
and you friend
somebody that will--

00:50:11.444 --> 00:50:12.860 align:middle line:84%
and the social
action doesn't have

00:50:12.860 --> 00:50:14.443 align:middle line:84%
to be related to the
course you're in.

00:50:14.443 --> 00:50:17.850 align:middle line:84%
Just do something to help
everybody is the message.

00:50:17.850 --> 00:50:19.770 align:middle line:84%
Take the knowledge
you have and give,

00:50:19.770 --> 00:50:22.030 align:middle line:90%
and collaborate with someone.

00:50:22.030 --> 00:50:24.590 align:middle line:84%
And so that's where the
Facebook pages come in.

00:50:24.590 --> 00:50:25.940 align:middle line:90%
And reflective notes.

00:50:25.940 --> 00:50:28.280 align:middle line:84%
So when people watch
something or read something,

00:50:28.280 --> 00:50:29.030 align:middle line:90%
they don't own it.

00:50:29.030 --> 00:50:29.821 align:middle line:90%
They don't have it.

00:50:29.821 --> 00:50:32.476 align:middle line:84%
But they reflect on it, and they
learn more about themselves.

00:50:32.476 --> 00:50:34.350 align:middle line:84%
But then they can go
onto a discussion board,

00:50:34.350 --> 00:50:35.780 align:middle line:90%
discuss a certain piece.

00:50:35.780 --> 00:50:39.670 align:middle line:84%
And so everybody is learning and
sharing and growing and seeing

00:50:39.670 --> 00:50:41.340 align:middle line:90%
how to process.

00:50:41.340 --> 00:50:43.900 align:middle line:90%
This is the psychological thing.

00:50:43.900 --> 00:50:46.060 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: What about
the socialization of it?

00:50:46.060 --> 00:50:49.870 align:middle line:84%
I mean, how does that
part come together,

00:50:49.870 --> 00:50:52.580 align:middle line:84%
where people are connecting
with each other, as you would,

00:50:52.580 --> 00:50:54.870 align:middle line:84%
say, in a traditional
school environment?

00:50:54.870 --> 00:50:56.280 align:middle line:84%
>>BOULTER: Well, in a
traditional school environment,

00:50:56.280 --> 00:50:57.850 align:middle line:84%
you're sitting in rows
not talking to anybody.

00:50:57.850 --> 00:50:59.290 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: No, I get that part.

00:50:59.290 --> 00:51:02.310 align:middle line:84%
But you can go and play a little
jump rope at recess or whatnot.

00:51:02.310 --> 00:51:03.932 align:middle line:84%
>>BOULTER: OK, I
understand that.

00:51:03.932 --> 00:51:05.890 align:middle line:84%
So in various communities
where there's people,

00:51:05.890 --> 00:51:07.990 align:middle line:84%
they can get together
and do projects.

00:51:07.990 --> 00:51:11.400 align:middle line:84%
And so you can be outdoors
doing a project with somebody,

00:51:11.400 --> 00:51:12.660 align:middle line:90%
and somebody's filming it.

00:51:12.660 --> 00:51:14.340 align:middle line:84%
And then they upload
it and share it.

00:51:14.340 --> 00:51:15.190 align:middle line:84%
And so it doesn't
mean that you're

00:51:15.190 --> 00:51:16.790 align:middle line:90%
sitting at the computer all day.

00:51:16.790 --> 00:51:19.060 align:middle line:90%
And it is about interactivity.

00:51:19.060 --> 00:51:22.180 align:middle line:84%
But the thing is is
that we only just met,

00:51:22.180 --> 00:51:24.614 align:middle line:84%
but I've seen you on
video for all these years.

00:51:24.614 --> 00:51:25.280 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:51:25.280 --> 00:51:26.988 align:middle line:84%
>>BOULTER: And so I
feel like I know you.

00:51:26.988 --> 00:51:29.110 align:middle line:84%
I mean, it's not that
different that there's

00:51:29.110 --> 00:51:30.410 align:middle line:90%
no screen in front.

00:51:30.410 --> 00:51:32.550 align:middle line:84%
And so I think that's
also a misnomer.

00:51:32.550 --> 00:51:34.800 align:middle line:84%
Like, when children go
away, and you've got Skype,

00:51:34.800 --> 00:51:37.500 align:middle line:84%
and you can see if they look
well, if they've got a haircut,

00:51:37.500 --> 00:51:38.640 align:middle line:90%
here's the dog.

00:51:38.640 --> 00:51:42.250 align:middle line:84%
With these kinds of things, we
really are able to communicate.

00:51:42.250 --> 00:51:44.720 align:middle line:84%
And so I've gone
for years working

00:51:44.720 --> 00:51:49.614 align:middle line:84%
with people, all kinds of
people that I've never met.

00:51:49.614 --> 00:51:51.780 align:middle line:84%
But that doesn't mean I
don't feel like I know them.

00:51:51.780 --> 00:51:53.350 align:middle line:84%
I know them by name,
I know their face,

00:51:53.350 --> 00:51:55.350 align:middle line:84%
I know their projects, I
know what they've done.

00:51:55.350 --> 00:51:57.560 align:middle line:84%
So it could be that you
meet people on the ground.

00:51:57.560 --> 00:51:59.430 align:middle line:84%
But when you're really
getting to work,

00:51:59.430 --> 00:52:02.111 align:middle line:90%
you can do that, collaborating.

00:52:02.111 --> 00:52:03.860 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And you can
do it through media.

00:52:03.860 --> 00:52:04.620 align:middle line:90%
>>BOULTER: Through media.

00:52:04.620 --> 00:52:05.745 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah, absolutely.

00:52:05.745 --> 00:52:07.680 align:middle line:84%
>>BOULTER: But you can
edit a paper together

00:52:07.680 --> 00:52:08.780 align:middle line:90%
on Skype in Google Docs.

00:52:08.780 --> 00:52:09.530 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Exactly.

00:52:09.530 --> 00:52:11.230 align:middle line:84%
>>BOULTER: These are the
skills that we teach people,

00:52:11.230 --> 00:52:12.714 align:middle line:84%
because we can say
hi and have tea,

00:52:12.714 --> 00:52:15.130 align:middle line:84%
but then we'll probably end
up sitting at our own computer

00:52:15.130 --> 00:52:16.190 align:middle line:90%
to do the work.

00:52:16.190 --> 00:52:17.950 align:middle line:84%
And so I think that
the interactivity

00:52:17.950 --> 00:52:19.360 align:middle line:90%
and the social part happens.

00:52:19.360 --> 00:52:20.930 align:middle line:90%
But people have friends.

00:52:20.930 --> 00:52:22.069 align:middle line:90%
They have neighbors.

00:52:22.069 --> 00:52:22.610 align:middle line:90%
I don't know.

00:52:22.610 --> 00:52:24.320 align:middle line:84%
I just don't see
that as a problem.

00:52:24.320 --> 00:52:26.346 align:middle line:84%
But lots of people
bring these up as flags.

00:52:26.346 --> 00:52:28.720 align:middle line:84%
Well, you'll just be stuck
with a computer and that's it,

00:52:28.720 --> 00:52:29.845 align:middle line:90%
and you won't know anybody.

00:52:29.845 --> 00:52:31.249 align:middle line:84%
I don't think
that's the problem.

00:52:31.249 --> 00:52:32.790 align:middle line:84%
>>And Gerald Celente--
and he's good.

00:52:32.790 --> 00:52:34.130 align:middle line:90%
Gerald Celente is good.

00:52:34.130 --> 00:52:36.390 align:middle line:84%
I don't know what
his record is, but it

00:52:36.390 --> 00:52:40.640 align:middle line:84%
used to be over 90% in terms
of his trendcasting-- future

00:52:40.640 --> 00:52:41.140 align:middle line:90%
trends.

00:52:41.140 --> 00:52:44.300 align:middle line:84%
And he usually goes a year
to two and even more out.

00:52:44.300 --> 00:52:47.840 align:middle line:84%
And he's saying
this is the future.

00:52:47.840 --> 00:52:48.770 align:middle line:90%
This is the future.

00:52:48.770 --> 00:52:51.030 align:middle line:84%
The old school way
is going to be dying,

00:52:51.030 --> 00:52:52.810 align:middle line:84%
and it is all
going to go online.

00:52:52.810 --> 00:52:54.930 align:middle line:84%
Ultimately, it's going
to be driven online.

00:52:54.930 --> 00:52:56.100 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Well, and let's
just think about this,

00:52:56.100 --> 00:52:57.649 align:middle line:84%
because a lot of
teachers, I said it,

00:52:57.649 --> 00:52:58.690 align:middle line:90%
are the most traditional.

00:52:58.690 --> 00:53:02.400 align:middle line:84%
My Ph.D. research was about
the adoption of technology.

00:53:02.400 --> 00:53:03.410 align:middle line:90%
But what's happening?

00:53:03.410 --> 00:53:05.490 align:middle line:84%
These huge buildings on
campuses that they're

00:53:05.490 --> 00:53:08.550 align:middle line:84%
paying enormous
utility bills for,

00:53:08.550 --> 00:53:11.010 align:middle line:84%
and people have to take
all the time to drive,

00:53:11.010 --> 00:53:12.744 align:middle line:84%
to park, get ready,
not in that order,

00:53:12.744 --> 00:53:13.910 align:middle line:90%
and end up in the classroom.

00:53:13.910 --> 00:53:14.770 align:middle line:84%
By the time they get
there, they're like,

00:53:14.770 --> 00:53:15.603 align:middle line:90%
you're at the front.

00:53:15.603 --> 00:53:16.295 align:middle line:90%
Teach me.

00:53:16.295 --> 00:53:18.920 align:middle line:84%
They're exhausted by
the time they get there.

00:53:18.920 --> 00:53:22.210 align:middle line:84%
And so a lot of institutions
are going to online classes.

00:53:22.210 --> 00:53:23.910 align:middle line:90%
But they're uploaded paper.

00:53:23.910 --> 00:53:25.730 align:middle line:90%
It's not interactivity.

00:53:25.730 --> 00:53:28.116 align:middle line:84%
They don't understand the
system of how to make it work.

00:53:28.116 --> 00:53:29.240 align:middle line:90%
Perhaps it's a lot of work.

00:53:29.240 --> 00:53:30.790 align:middle line:90%
Perhaps it's a vision.

00:53:30.790 --> 00:53:33.724 align:middle line:84%
But even professors can learn
how to make this happen.

00:53:33.724 --> 00:53:34.390 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Mm-hm.

00:53:34.390 --> 00:53:36.220 align:middle line:84%
And also, you're talking
about some economics,

00:53:36.220 --> 00:53:37.511 align:middle line:90%
which I said we would get into.

00:53:37.511 --> 00:53:41.440 align:middle line:84%
First of all, universities spend
astronomical amounts of money

00:53:41.440 --> 00:53:43.360 align:middle line:84%
to try to doll the
place up and have

00:53:43.360 --> 00:53:46.850 align:middle line:84%
great gyms and amenities
and such to draw

00:53:46.850 --> 00:53:48.840 align:middle line:84%
some new students
in that have parents

00:53:48.840 --> 00:53:50.420 align:middle line:90%
that have a little bit of cash.

00:53:50.420 --> 00:53:52.450 align:middle line:84%
And so here, you're
talking about something

00:53:52.450 --> 00:53:54.010 align:middle line:90%
that's surely about impression.

00:53:54.010 --> 00:53:56.330 align:middle line:84%
It's not even used
toward education.

00:53:56.330 --> 00:53:59.680 align:middle line:84%
Massive amounts of the money
in the total educational system

00:53:59.680 --> 00:54:01.380 align:middle line:84%
in higher education
are going just

00:54:01.380 --> 00:54:03.860 align:middle line:84%
for these impression
factors alone.

00:54:03.860 --> 00:54:05.946 align:middle line:84%
Let's talk about
college tuition.

00:54:05.946 --> 00:54:06.445 align:middle line:90%
The burden.

00:54:06.445 --> 00:54:07.970 align:middle line:84%
We only have a
couple minutes left.

00:54:07.970 --> 00:54:10.650 align:middle line:84%
The burden that kids come
out with now, average,

00:54:10.650 --> 00:54:12.182 align:middle line:84%
on average, compared
to-- and then

00:54:12.182 --> 00:54:14.640 align:middle line:84%
give us an idea of what it
costs to take a course with you.

00:54:14.640 --> 00:54:18.110 align:middle line:84%
>>BOULTER: Well, to me,
the problem is interest.

00:54:18.110 --> 00:54:19.110 align:middle line:90%
Compounded interest.

00:54:19.110 --> 00:54:20.075 align:middle line:90%
Years of interest.

00:54:20.075 --> 00:54:20.690 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes, years.

00:54:20.690 --> 00:54:21.273 align:middle line:90%
>>BOULTER: OK.

00:54:21.273 --> 00:54:23.730 align:middle line:84%
And so you're not just
paying the fee, which

00:54:23.730 --> 00:54:26.640 align:middle line:84%
is already astronomical,
but there's

00:54:26.640 --> 00:54:29.980 align:middle line:84%
government ways that they make
the fees go up and up and up.

00:54:29.980 --> 00:54:32.590 align:middle line:84%
And so I just want to mention
that at the University

00:54:32.590 --> 00:54:34.677 align:middle line:84%
of Calgary, my courses,
when students came

00:54:34.677 --> 00:54:37.010 align:middle line:84%
to me in the Graduate Division
of Educational Research--

00:54:37.010 --> 00:54:39.027 align:middle line:90%
the courses were $1,111.

00:54:39.027 --> 00:54:41.610 align:middle line:84%
But if they took a face to face
class, it was half that price.

00:54:41.610 --> 00:54:42.225 align:middle line:90%
Why?

00:54:42.225 --> 00:54:44.350 align:middle line:84%
Because the government
would meet dollar for dollar

00:54:44.350 --> 00:54:45.687 align:middle line:90%
on a face to face class.

00:54:45.687 --> 00:54:47.145 align:middle line:84%
They wanted every
single person who

00:54:47.145 --> 00:54:48.870 align:middle line:84%
was graduating with
a teaching degree

00:54:48.870 --> 00:54:53.130 align:middle line:84%
to be able to have computer
skills and online skills,

00:54:53.130 --> 00:54:54.960 align:middle line:84%
but then they charge
people double.

00:54:54.960 --> 00:54:57.280 align:middle line:84%
Even so, people would rather
take the course online,

00:54:57.280 --> 00:54:59.196 align:middle line:84%
because they can do it
at 2:00 in the morning.

00:54:59.196 --> 00:55:01.496 align:middle line:84%
They could do it from
anyplace they were working.

00:55:01.496 --> 00:55:03.370 align:middle line:84%
A lot of my students
were out of the country.

00:55:03.370 --> 00:55:05.430 align:middle line:90%
And then get a Canadian degree.

00:55:05.430 --> 00:55:06.110 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Mm-hm.

00:55:06.110 --> 00:55:07.484 align:middle line:84%
>>BOULTER: And so
I'm going to be

00:55:07.484 --> 00:55:10.720 align:middle line:84%
charging 10% of
that for a course.

00:55:10.720 --> 00:55:12.560 align:middle line:84%
And just because I
think we can do it.

00:55:12.560 --> 00:55:14.100 align:middle line:84%
You can have more
numbers in there.

00:55:14.100 --> 00:55:16.696 align:middle line:84%
But then when it comes time
to assessing your material

00:55:16.696 --> 00:55:19.070 align:middle line:84%
or getting something marked,
then maybe you pay for that.

00:55:19.070 --> 00:55:21.361 align:middle line:84%
If you need supervision on
a dissertation or something,

00:55:21.361 --> 00:55:22.190 align:middle line:90%
you pay for that.

00:55:22.190 --> 00:55:24.852 align:middle line:84%
But if you're paying
$8,000 a semester or more--

00:55:24.852 --> 00:55:25.810 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Or more yeah.

00:55:25.810 --> 00:55:27.740 align:middle line:84%
>>BOULTER: And the
professor never answers you,

00:55:27.740 --> 00:55:29.870 align:middle line:84%
never answers your phone calls,
doesn't answer your emails,

00:55:29.870 --> 00:55:31.040 align:middle line:90%
what's the $8,000 for?

00:55:31.040 --> 00:55:33.420 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Well, and if
you're doing that on a loan,

00:55:33.420 --> 00:55:37.060 align:middle line:84%
you're looking at coming out
with $40,000 or $50,000 minimum

00:55:37.060 --> 00:55:38.790 align:middle line:90%
just for a really basic.

00:55:38.790 --> 00:55:40.760 align:middle line:84%
And you're talking
well over $100,000

00:55:40.760 --> 00:55:42.849 align:middle line:84%
if you're going to
any advanced degree.

00:55:42.849 --> 00:55:44.390 align:middle line:84%
>>BOULTER: And how
about a $200 book?

00:55:44.390 --> 00:55:45.100 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah, a $200 book.

00:55:45.100 --> 00:55:46.475 align:middle line:84%
>>BOULTER: How
many times can you

00:55:46.475 --> 00:55:49.440 align:middle line:84%
click $1.99 for this,
$2.99, $0.99 for this.

00:55:49.440 --> 00:55:51.315 align:middle line:84%
That takes you a long
time to add up to $200,

00:55:51.315 --> 00:55:52.890 align:middle line:84%
and you're getting
something that's

00:55:52.890 --> 00:55:55.020 align:middle line:84%
fresh and live and
really researched.

00:55:55.020 --> 00:55:57.360 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So essentially,
you don't come out saddled,

00:55:57.360 --> 00:56:01.409 align:middle line:84%
at the age of 23 years old, with
this massive debt on your back

00:56:01.409 --> 00:56:03.200 align:middle line:84%
which already has you
behind the eight ball

00:56:03.200 --> 00:56:05.230 align:middle line:84%
before you ever have a
chance to go prove yourself.

00:56:05.230 --> 00:56:06.350 align:middle line:90%
>>BOULTER: How about this?

00:56:06.350 --> 00:56:08.010 align:middle line:84%
The student can
actually publish,

00:56:08.010 --> 00:56:09.102 align:middle line:90%
and they get the $0.99.

00:56:09.102 --> 00:56:10.060 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: There you go.

00:56:10.060 --> 00:56:12.332 align:middle line:84%
>>BOULTER: And so they're
getting a credit account

00:56:12.332 --> 00:56:13.540 align:middle line:90%
and then doing other courses.

00:56:13.540 --> 00:56:14.900 align:middle line:90%
Just imagine how that can work.

00:56:14.900 --> 00:56:15.880 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: It sounds fabulous.

00:56:15.880 --> 00:56:17.713 align:middle line:84%
So you say that you're
going to have this up

00:56:17.713 --> 00:56:19.497 align:middle line:90%
and running very shortly now.

00:56:19.497 --> 00:56:21.205 align:middle line:84%
In fact, in January,
it's running, right?

00:56:21.205 --> 00:56:21.520 align:middle line:90%
>>BOULTER: Uh-huh.

00:56:21.520 --> 00:56:22.250 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: OK.

00:56:22.250 --> 00:56:22.790 align:middle line:90%
Very good.

00:56:22.790 --> 00:56:24.706 align:middle line:84%
Well, thank you so much,
and for all the years

00:56:24.706 --> 00:56:26.190 align:middle line:84%
and years-- decades
of work you've

00:56:26.190 --> 00:56:28.720 align:middle line:84%
put into this in advance,
just to get us to the point

00:56:28.720 --> 00:56:30.100 align:middle line:90%
where that's even an option now.

00:56:30.100 --> 00:56:32.410 align:middle line:84%
Thank you so much for
joining us, Carmen.

00:56:32.410 --> 00:56:33.910 align:middle line:84%
Loads of food for
thought, if you're

00:56:33.910 --> 00:56:36.770 align:middle line:84%
a parent or a kid looking
for a satisfying future.

00:56:36.770 --> 00:56:38.680 align:middle line:84%
You might want to also
watch the full length

00:56:38.680 --> 00:56:40.930 align:middle line:84%
version of College
Conspiracy on YouTube

00:56:40.930 --> 00:56:43.150 align:middle line:84%
just to get a fuller
picture of the problem.

00:56:43.150 --> 00:56:45.500 align:middle line:10%
But for the solutions,
you can take a look

00:56:45.500 --> 00:56:49.100 align:middle line:10%
into interactive-u.com to
connect with Carmen's online

00:56:49.100 --> 00:56:50.840 align:middle line:10%
educational platforms.

00:56:50.840 --> 00:56:55.190 align:middle line:10%
Until next time, thank you for
joining us here on Gaiam TV.
