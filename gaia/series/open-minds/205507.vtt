00:00:09.232 --> 00:00:10.690 align:middle line:84%
>>HARRY ADELSON:
We have stem cells

00:00:10.690 --> 00:00:13.360 align:middle line:84%
in all the tissues in
our body, and their role

00:00:13.360 --> 00:00:16.850 align:middle line:84%
is to maintain the health
of their microenvironment.

00:00:16.850 --> 00:00:19.330 align:middle line:84%
So how healthy
you are is largely

00:00:19.330 --> 00:00:22.570 align:middle line:84%
determined by the function
of your stem cells

00:00:22.570 --> 00:00:25.000 align:middle line:84%
and the population
of stem cells.

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:27.470 align:middle line:84%
Fetal stem cells,
like, no one uses them.

00:00:27.470 --> 00:00:28.960 align:middle line:90%
It's just not a thing.

00:00:28.960 --> 00:00:32.350 align:middle line:84%
Embryonic stem cells,
it's so primitive

00:00:32.350 --> 00:00:34.360 align:middle line:84%
that it tends to turn
into all different kinds

00:00:34.360 --> 00:00:35.690 align:middle line:90%
of weird things.

00:00:35.690 --> 00:00:38.200 align:middle line:84%
So the cells that we
mostly use therapeutically

00:00:38.200 --> 00:00:40.810 align:middle line:84%
are what are called
mesenchymal stem cells.

00:00:40.810 --> 00:00:43.510 align:middle line:84%
When you inject stem cells
into the skin of the face,

00:00:43.510 --> 00:00:46.460 align:middle line:84%
it improves elasticity
and hydration,

00:00:46.460 --> 00:00:49.180 align:middle line:84%
which doesn't give
this dramatic look.

00:00:49.180 --> 00:00:50.830 align:middle line:90%
People just sort of say, oh--

00:00:50.830 --> 00:00:51.760 align:middle line:84%

>>REGINA: One of the
most exciting areas

00:00:59.690 --> 00:01:01.970 align:middle line:84%
of advanced medicine
has been stem cells.

00:01:01.970 --> 00:01:05.060 align:middle line:10%
There was a big storm about
the subject a decade ago or so

00:01:05.060 --> 00:01:07.250 align:middle line:10%
over the sources of
the cells, but much

00:01:07.250 --> 00:01:09.140 align:middle line:10%
has happened since
then, and there's still

00:01:09.140 --> 00:01:11.750 align:middle line:10%
a very bright light in
the future of medicine.

00:01:11.750 --> 00:01:13.520 align:middle line:84%
Dr. Harry Adelson
is with us today

00:01:13.520 --> 00:01:16.380 align:middle line:84%
to give us an update of where
we are with stem cells today.

00:01:16.380 --> 00:01:17.180 align:middle line:90%
Welcome.

00:01:17.180 --> 00:01:18.210 align:middle line:90%
>>ADELSON: Thank you so much.

00:01:18.210 --> 00:01:19.850 align:middle line:84%
It's such a pleasure
to be here with you.

00:01:19.850 --> 00:01:21.683 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: It really
truly-- it's the future.

00:01:21.683 --> 00:01:23.540 align:middle line:84%
It's part of the
future of medicine.

00:01:23.540 --> 00:01:25.040 align:middle line:90%
It's an exciting subject.

00:01:25.040 --> 00:01:27.713 align:middle line:84%
And before we get
into how it works--

00:01:27.713 --> 00:01:30.380 align:middle line:84%
because it does seem like magic,
it seems like there's some kind

00:01:30.380 --> 00:01:33.320 align:middle line:84%
of divine orchestration
that our cells do--

00:01:33.320 --> 00:01:35.456 align:middle line:90%
let's talk about you.

00:01:35.456 --> 00:01:37.692 align:middle line:84%
And I know just a
tiny bit about you

00:01:37.692 --> 00:01:39.650 align:middle line:84%
in that you were a rock
climber, and this seems

00:01:39.650 --> 00:01:41.960 align:middle line:90%
to be important to this story.

00:01:41.960 --> 00:01:44.460 align:middle line:84%
We've got the beautiful
Flatiron Mountains there.

00:01:44.460 --> 00:01:47.300 align:middle line:84%
A lot of people climb
rocks, but stuff happens.

00:01:47.300 --> 00:01:49.940 align:middle line:84%
So take it away, Harry,
and tell us what happened.

00:01:49.940 --> 00:01:51.530 align:middle line:10%
>>ADELSON: Well,
my journey actually

00:01:51.530 --> 00:01:54.945 align:middle line:10%
started right here in Boulder,
Colorado, on those Flatirons.

00:01:54.945 --> 00:01:55.820 align:middle line:10%
>>REGINA: Oh, really?

00:01:55.820 --> 00:01:58.237 align:middle line:10%
>>ADELSON: That's where I fell
in love with rock climbing.

00:01:58.237 --> 00:02:00.050 align:middle line:84%
I was straight out
of McGill University,

00:02:00.050 --> 00:02:02.330 align:middle line:84%
and I moved here to
learn how to rock climb

00:02:02.330 --> 00:02:05.360 align:middle line:84%
and to try to figure out what
I wanted to be when I grew up.

00:02:05.360 --> 00:02:07.520 align:middle line:90%
And I ended up getting sick.

00:02:07.520 --> 00:02:10.009 align:middle line:84%
I sort of came down with
like a mono or something.

00:02:10.009 --> 00:02:12.410 align:middle line:84%
And I was seeing this
chiropractor here in Boulder.

00:02:12.410 --> 00:02:15.470 align:middle line:84%
And I don't think that he really
helped me, but I liked him,

00:02:15.470 --> 00:02:17.220 align:middle line:90%
and I liked what he did.

00:02:17.220 --> 00:02:19.610 align:middle line:84%
And so I started
looking into sort

00:02:19.610 --> 00:02:23.810 align:middle line:84%
of chiropractic school versus
conventional medical school.

00:02:23.810 --> 00:02:26.570 align:middle line:84%
And I was deciding
which route to go,

00:02:26.570 --> 00:02:29.450 align:middle line:84%
and I saw an ad
in "Yoga Journal"

00:02:29.450 --> 00:02:32.390 align:middle line:84%
for the Southwest College of
Naturopathic Medicine which

00:02:32.390 --> 00:02:35.150 align:middle line:84%
listed the six
guiding principles

00:02:35.150 --> 00:02:37.850 align:middle line:84%
of naturopathic medicine,
the first of which

00:02:37.850 --> 00:02:40.760 align:middle line:84%
being vis medicatrix
naturae, which

00:02:40.760 --> 00:02:44.810 align:middle line:84%
is the Latin term for the
healing power of nature.

00:02:44.810 --> 00:02:47.780 align:middle line:84%
Well, I completely fell in
love with these six guiding

00:02:47.780 --> 00:02:48.710 align:middle line:90%
principles.

00:02:48.710 --> 00:02:50.570 align:middle line:90%
Went to naturopathic school.

00:02:50.570 --> 00:02:53.420 align:middle line:84%
And in my first year, I
was training for my dream

00:02:53.420 --> 00:02:56.330 align:middle line:84%
climbing trip to France, the
birthplace of modern sport

00:02:56.330 --> 00:02:57.230 align:middle line:90%
climbing.

00:02:57.230 --> 00:03:00.110 align:middle line:84%
And I was doing this hard
cross-through move in the gym,

00:03:00.110 --> 00:03:01.985 align:middle line:84%
and I felt this revolting
pop in my shoulder.

00:03:01.985 --> 00:03:02.785 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Ooh.

00:03:02.785 --> 00:03:03.770 align:middle line:90%
You don't like the pop.

00:03:03.770 --> 00:03:04.940 align:middle line:90%
No one likes that pop.

00:03:04.940 --> 00:03:05.870 align:middle line:90%
>>ADELSON: Yeah.

00:03:05.870 --> 00:03:09.230 align:middle line:84%
I saw a surgeon and he said,
well, you've torn your labrum.

00:03:09.230 --> 00:03:11.150 align:middle line:84%
You've torn the cartilage
in your shoulder.

00:03:11.150 --> 00:03:13.700 align:middle line:84%
I can put a scope in
there and cut it away.

00:03:13.700 --> 00:03:15.330 align:middle line:84%
It'll help you in
the short term,

00:03:15.330 --> 00:03:17.970 align:middle line:84%
but it's going to cause
you problems later in life.

00:03:17.970 --> 00:03:21.080 align:middle line:84%
Well, this didn't make any
sense to me, because here I was,

00:03:21.080 --> 00:03:24.140 align:middle line:84%
young, healthy, in
naturopathic school,

00:03:24.140 --> 00:03:25.820 align:middle line:90%
learning naturopathic medicine.

00:03:25.820 --> 00:03:30.230 align:middle line:84%
And I felt like there had to be
a way to treat this naturally.

00:03:30.230 --> 00:03:31.760 align:middle line:90%
So I started asking around.

00:03:31.760 --> 00:03:34.340 align:middle line:84%
And this was back
in the early '90s

00:03:34.340 --> 00:03:38.150 align:middle line:84%
when research meant you
actually had to talk to people.

00:03:38.150 --> 00:03:40.100 align:middle line:84%
And I found out
about Rick Marinelli

00:03:40.100 --> 00:03:41.720 align:middle line:84%
who was the first
naturopathic doctor

00:03:41.720 --> 00:03:44.750 align:middle line:84%
to perform prolotherapy,
which is also called

00:03:44.750 --> 00:03:47.120 align:middle line:90%
regenerative injection therapy.

00:03:47.120 --> 00:03:48.980 align:middle line:84%
And regenerative
injection therapy

00:03:48.980 --> 00:03:51.530 align:middle line:84%
is the injection of
natural substances

00:03:51.530 --> 00:03:53.990 align:middle line:84%
that are simultaneously
nutritive

00:03:53.990 --> 00:03:55.530 align:middle line:90%
and slightly irritating.

00:03:55.530 --> 00:03:56.330 align:middle line:90%
So they--

00:03:56.330 --> 00:03:57.140 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Well,
give us an example

00:03:57.140 --> 00:03:58.790 align:middle line:84%
of what that cocktail
might be like.

00:03:58.790 --> 00:04:03.350 align:middle line:84%
>>ADELSON: It's usually
a 10% or 12.5% dextrose.

00:04:03.350 --> 00:04:04.400 align:middle line:90%
So it's a sugar water.

00:04:04.400 --> 00:04:05.030 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Sugar water.

00:04:05.030 --> 00:04:05.450 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:04:05.450 --> 00:04:06.465 align:middle line:90%
What's on top of it?

00:04:06.465 --> 00:04:07.590 align:middle line:90%
>>ADELSON: Well, that's it.

00:04:07.590 --> 00:04:08.390 align:middle line:90%
That's it.

00:04:08.390 --> 00:04:10.070 align:middle line:84%
And a little bit of
local anesthetic.

00:04:10.070 --> 00:04:10.730 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: You're kidding.

00:04:10.730 --> 00:04:11.780 align:middle line:84%
>>ADELSON: As
naturopaths, we would

00:04:11.780 --> 00:04:14.238 align:middle line:84%
use a little bit of glucosamine,
sulfate, and a little B12.

00:04:14.238 --> 00:04:16.430 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: What is
it about sugar that

00:04:16.430 --> 00:04:18.260 align:middle line:90%
has that regenerative capacity?

00:04:18.260 --> 00:04:20.329 align:middle line:84%
>>ADELSON: Well,
after oxygen, sugar

00:04:20.329 --> 00:04:23.190 align:middle line:84%
is the most important
nutrient to cells.

00:04:23.190 --> 00:04:26.270 align:middle line:84%
So it's nutritive, but it's
also slightly irritating,

00:04:26.270 --> 00:04:29.300 align:middle line:84%
because at that percentage,
it's hypertonic,

00:04:29.300 --> 00:04:31.038 align:middle line:90%
so it's slightly irritating.

00:04:31.038 --> 00:04:32.330 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Is it kind of acidic?

00:04:32.330 --> 00:04:34.450 align:middle line:84%
I mean, is that even
a part of it, or--

00:04:34.450 --> 00:04:38.840 align:middle line:84%
>>ADELSON: It's not so much the
acidity as the concentration

00:04:38.840 --> 00:04:39.980 align:middle line:90%
of the solution.

00:04:39.980 --> 00:04:40.880 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: OK.

00:04:40.880 --> 00:04:42.230 align:middle line:90%
>>ADELSON: So--

00:04:42.230 --> 00:04:45.270 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So you're injecting a
saturated amount into an area.

00:04:45.270 --> 00:04:46.070 align:middle line:90%
>>ADELSON: Yeah.

00:04:46.070 --> 00:04:47.990 align:middle line:84%
So you're essentially
tricking the body

00:04:47.990 --> 00:04:51.170 align:middle line:84%
into thinking that it's been
injured without actually

00:04:51.170 --> 00:04:53.840 align:middle line:84%
causing any tissue
insult. So you're

00:04:53.840 --> 00:04:57.620 align:middle line:84%
launching the body's natural
healing ability without having

00:04:57.620 --> 00:04:58.760 align:middle line:90%
been injured.

00:04:58.760 --> 00:05:02.210 align:middle line:84%
And I had it done to me,
and it worked so well

00:05:02.210 --> 00:05:06.860 align:middle line:84%
that I knew that's what I
wanted to do as a career.

00:05:06.860 --> 00:05:09.030 align:middle line:90%
My trip to France was splendid.

00:05:09.030 --> 00:05:10.700 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: How long
did it take to heal?

00:05:10.700 --> 00:05:11.510 align:middle line:90%
>>ADELSON: Two months.

00:05:11.510 --> 00:05:11.950 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Wow.

00:05:11.950 --> 00:05:12.260 align:middle line:90%
>>ADELSON: Yeah.

00:05:12.260 --> 00:05:14.180 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: With no lasting
damage, unlike what

00:05:14.180 --> 00:05:15.450 align:middle line:84%
would have happened
with surgery.

00:05:15.450 --> 00:05:16.010 align:middle line:90%
>>ADELSON: That's right.

00:05:16.010 --> 00:05:16.810 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Wow.

00:05:16.810 --> 00:05:18.440 align:middle line:90%
>>ADELSON: That's right.

00:05:18.440 --> 00:05:22.700 align:middle line:84%
So when I got out of my hospital
residency, I went into practice

00:05:22.700 --> 00:05:24.980 align:middle line:84%
and just practiced
regenerative injection therapy,

00:05:24.980 --> 00:05:27.620 align:middle line:84%
and I thought that's all I would
do for the rest of my career.

00:05:27.620 --> 00:05:30.530 align:middle line:84%
And then in 2006,
platelet-rich plasma

00:05:30.530 --> 00:05:33.140 align:middle line:84%
came along, which is sort
of a biologic version

00:05:33.140 --> 00:05:34.610 align:middle line:90%
of prolotherapy.

00:05:34.610 --> 00:05:38.960 align:middle line:84%
You do a blood draw, spin
the blood in a centrifuge,

00:05:38.960 --> 00:05:41.390 align:middle line:84%
concentrate down
the blood platelets.

00:05:41.390 --> 00:05:43.790 align:middle line:84%
Now, platelets are what are
responsible for clotting

00:05:43.790 --> 00:05:45.020 align:middle line:90%
after an injury.

00:05:45.020 --> 00:05:47.780 align:middle line:84%
But once they clot, they
release growth factors

00:05:47.780 --> 00:05:49.790 align:middle line:84%
such as platelet-derived
growth factor.

00:05:49.790 --> 00:05:53.060 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And is that that kind
of yellowish fluid that's left

00:05:53.060 --> 00:05:54.230 align:middle line:90%
when you spin it, or--

00:05:54.230 --> 00:05:57.760 align:middle line:84%
>>ADELSON: Well, the
yellow fluid is the serum.

00:05:57.760 --> 00:05:59.773 align:middle line:84%
So when you spin
it down, on the top

00:05:59.773 --> 00:06:00.940 align:middle line:90%
you've got the yellow fluid.

00:06:00.940 --> 00:06:03.095 align:middle line:84%
On the bottom you've
got the red blood cells,

00:06:03.095 --> 00:06:05.470 align:middle line:84%
because they're the heaviest
because of the iron content.

00:06:05.470 --> 00:06:07.540 align:middle line:84%
But then in the middle,
you have the buffy layer.

00:06:07.540 --> 00:06:09.352 align:middle line:84%
And that contains
the white cells,

00:06:09.352 --> 00:06:10.810 align:middle line:84%
but it also contains
the platelets.

00:06:10.810 --> 00:06:11.500 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: OK.

00:06:11.500 --> 00:06:11.890 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:06:11.890 --> 00:06:13.265 align:middle line:84%
>>ADELSON: And
platelets are what

00:06:13.265 --> 00:06:17.080 align:middle line:84%
are responsible for triggering
healing after injury.

00:06:17.080 --> 00:06:19.690 align:middle line:84%
So I started using
that, and I found

00:06:19.690 --> 00:06:23.050 align:middle line:84%
that it worked much better
than the dextrose solution.

00:06:23.050 --> 00:06:26.140 align:middle line:84%
Instead of getting the
job done in 10 to 12

00:06:26.140 --> 00:06:28.570 align:middle line:84%
prolotherapy treatments, we
were getting the job done

00:06:28.570 --> 00:06:30.350 align:middle line:90%
in four to six PRP treatments.

00:06:30.350 --> 00:06:31.150 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Wow.

00:06:31.150 --> 00:06:32.302 align:middle line:90%
That's significant.

00:06:32.302 --> 00:06:34.760 align:middle line:84%
>>ADELSON: So for a period of
four years, that's all I did.

00:06:34.760 --> 00:06:36.460 align:middle line:84%
And I thought that was
all I was going to do

00:06:36.460 --> 00:06:37.360 align:middle line:90%
for the rest of my career.

00:06:37.360 --> 00:06:37.870 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: You were happy.

00:06:37.870 --> 00:06:38.890 align:middle line:90%
>>ADELSON: That's right.

00:06:38.890 --> 00:06:43.450 align:middle line:84%
And then in 2009, one of my
favorite patients, a woman

00:06:43.450 --> 00:06:45.010 align:middle line:90%
named Laura came to me.

00:06:45.010 --> 00:06:47.950 align:middle line:84%
And she had this painful
knee from this bad injury

00:06:47.950 --> 00:06:49.077 align:middle line:90%
that she had sustained.

00:06:49.077 --> 00:06:51.160 align:middle line:84%
And we had been treating
her for a number of years

00:06:51.160 --> 00:06:53.590 align:middle line:90%
with prolotherapy and then PRP.

00:06:53.590 --> 00:06:55.300 align:middle line:84%
And I was getting her
to a certain level,

00:06:55.300 --> 00:06:58.210 align:middle line:84%
but we just couldn't seem
to get beyond that level.

00:06:58.210 --> 00:07:00.980 align:middle line:84%
And she was a very,
very smart woman.

00:07:00.980 --> 00:07:03.670 align:middle line:84%
And she walked into my office
with a stack of papers,

00:07:03.670 --> 00:07:06.920 align:middle line:84%
dropped them on my desk
and she was she said,

00:07:06.920 --> 00:07:09.800 align:middle line:84%
I want you to inject stem
cells from my bone marrow

00:07:09.800 --> 00:07:10.600 align:middle line:90%
into my knee.

00:07:10.600 --> 00:07:13.360 align:middle line:84%
And the stack of papers
was animal studies

00:07:13.360 --> 00:07:15.670 align:middle line:90%
of bone marrow stem cells.

00:07:15.670 --> 00:07:19.730 align:middle line:84%
And I said, Laura, you know,
I don't know how to do that.

00:07:19.730 --> 00:07:20.920 align:middle line:90%
And she said, well, learn.

00:07:20.920 --> 00:07:21.310 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Learn.

00:07:21.310 --> 00:07:21.700 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHS]

00:07:21.700 --> 00:07:23.870 align:middle line:84%
>>ADELSON: And I said, Laura,
you know, I'm a naturopath.

00:07:23.870 --> 00:07:25.540 align:middle line:84%
Do you-- do you know
how much criticism

00:07:25.540 --> 00:07:28.360 align:middle line:84%
I'll get if I start doing
bone marrow aspirations?

00:07:28.360 --> 00:07:30.320 align:middle line:84%
And she looked at
me and she said,

00:07:30.320 --> 00:07:33.920 align:middle line:84%
well, I'm a materials engineer
for NASA, and I'm a woman.

00:07:33.920 --> 00:07:36.880 align:middle line:84%
So if you want to complain to
me about people telling you

00:07:36.880 --> 00:07:38.430 align:middle line:84%
that you're out of
your league, I'm

00:07:38.430 --> 00:07:40.180 align:middle line:84%
afraid you're talking
to the wrong person.

00:07:40.180 --> 00:07:41.410 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: I love it.

00:07:41.410 --> 00:07:42.557 align:middle line:90%
She put you in your place.

00:07:42.557 --> 00:07:44.140 align:middle line:84%
>>ADELSON: I couldn't
argue with that.

00:07:44.140 --> 00:07:44.940 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:07:44.940 --> 00:07:46.950 align:middle line:84%
So did you have to
learn how to do this?

00:07:46.950 --> 00:07:47.360 align:middle line:90%
>>ADELSON: Yes.

00:07:47.360 --> 00:07:47.680 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

00:07:47.680 --> 00:07:49.750 align:middle line:84%
So I found a surgeon who
was willing to teach me

00:07:49.750 --> 00:07:52.120 align:middle line:84%
how to perform a bone
marrow aspiration.

00:07:52.120 --> 00:07:55.900 align:middle line:84%
I started doing it, and I was
so blown away with the results.

00:07:55.900 --> 00:07:58.058 align:middle line:84%
I knew that was what
I was going to do.

00:07:58.058 --> 00:07:59.350 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: And you're committed.

00:07:59.350 --> 00:08:01.000 align:middle line:84%
You're passionate
about it, and it

00:08:01.000 --> 00:08:03.670 align:middle line:84%
appears that it works a good
amount of the time, right?

00:08:03.670 --> 00:08:03.880 align:middle line:90%
>>ADELSON: Yes.

00:08:03.880 --> 00:08:05.680 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: We're going to talk
about where it really works,

00:08:05.680 --> 00:08:07.060 align:middle line:90%
where it doesn't work so well.

00:08:07.060 --> 00:08:11.440 align:middle line:84%
But first of all, let's talk
about now the stem cell--

00:08:11.440 --> 00:08:14.530 align:middle line:84%
stem cell history itself in
terms of where it's been,

00:08:14.530 --> 00:08:15.820 align:middle line:90%
because most people think--

00:08:15.820 --> 00:08:18.770 align:middle line:84%
they've seen these pictures
of fetuses and, like, ah!

00:08:18.770 --> 00:08:19.570 align:middle line:90%
You know?

00:08:19.570 --> 00:08:22.960 align:middle line:84%
And they develop this fear
over it to begin with.

00:08:22.960 --> 00:08:25.240 align:middle line:84%
That made it to mainstream
news for a while there

00:08:25.240 --> 00:08:27.790 align:middle line:84%
and people kind of dialed
out, but that's not

00:08:27.790 --> 00:08:29.950 align:middle line:84%
where the story
really began or ended.

00:08:29.950 --> 00:08:33.624 align:middle line:84%
So let's talk about the
real history of stem cells,

00:08:33.624 --> 00:08:36.159 align:middle line:84%
where the fetuses
initially came in, what

00:08:36.159 --> 00:08:38.260 align:middle line:84%
other sources besides bone
marrow, which you just

00:08:38.260 --> 00:08:39.340 align:middle line:90%
brought up.

00:08:39.340 --> 00:08:41.260 align:middle line:84%
We have resources of
it and all the way

00:08:41.260 --> 00:08:43.400 align:middle line:90%
through down to umbilical cords.

00:08:43.400 --> 00:08:44.200 align:middle line:90%
>>ADELSON: Sure.

00:08:44.200 --> 00:08:45.100 align:middle line:90%
Sure.

00:08:45.100 --> 00:08:48.280 align:middle line:84%
Well, how fetuses
accidentally got in there--

00:08:48.280 --> 00:08:51.790 align:middle line:84%
and you know, like most areas
of knowledge in the world,

00:08:51.790 --> 00:08:55.090 align:middle line:84%
there's a tremendous amount
of disinformation out there.

00:08:55.090 --> 00:08:57.760 align:middle line:84%
But the reason we sort of
got into this conversation

00:08:57.760 --> 00:09:00.880 align:middle line:84%
about fetuses was because
the early stem cell research

00:09:00.880 --> 00:09:02.870 align:middle line:90%
was embryonic stem cells.

00:09:02.870 --> 00:09:06.760 align:middle line:84%
And now the reason for that
is because in those days,

00:09:06.760 --> 00:09:10.840 align:middle line:84%
it was mostly researchers
who are PhDs, not MDs, doing

00:09:10.840 --> 00:09:11.720 align:middle line:90%
the research.

00:09:11.720 --> 00:09:14.080 align:middle line:84%
And for those guys,
they have easy access

00:09:14.080 --> 00:09:16.510 align:middle line:84%
to embryonic stem
cells, because they just

00:09:16.510 --> 00:09:18.790 align:middle line:84%
go to in vitro
fertilization labs

00:09:18.790 --> 00:09:21.880 align:middle line:84%
and they've got freezers
and freezers filled

00:09:21.880 --> 00:09:23.540 align:middle line:90%
of these embryonic stem cells.

00:09:23.540 --> 00:09:26.800 align:middle line:84%
So it's very easy for
them to retrieve those.

00:09:26.800 --> 00:09:29.030 align:middle line:84%
The issue with
that is an embryo--

00:09:29.030 --> 00:09:32.320 align:middle line:84%
now remember, first you have the
zygote, which is the two cells.

00:09:32.320 --> 00:09:34.340 align:middle line:84%
And then you have this
clump of eight cells,

00:09:34.340 --> 00:09:35.920 align:middle line:90%
which is the embryo.

00:09:35.920 --> 00:09:38.830 align:middle line:84%
And then way down the line
you have a fetus, which

00:09:38.830 --> 00:09:39.730 align:middle line:90%
looks like a human.

00:09:39.730 --> 00:09:41.290 align:middle line:84%
It looks like-- at first,
it looks like a tadpole.

00:09:41.290 --> 00:09:43.180 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: A lot happens
between those two points.

00:09:43.180 --> 00:09:43.840 align:middle line:90%
>>ADELSON: That's right.

00:09:43.840 --> 00:09:44.640 align:middle line:90%
That's right.

00:09:44.640 --> 00:09:47.950 align:middle line:84%
So fetal stem cells
is not a thing.

00:09:47.950 --> 00:09:50.170 align:middle line:84%
They're not used for--
like, no one uses them.

00:09:50.170 --> 00:09:51.820 align:middle line:90%
It's just not a thing.

00:09:51.820 --> 00:09:57.050 align:middle line:84%
Embryonic stem cells is used
now in research purposes,

00:09:57.050 --> 00:09:59.440 align:middle line:84%
but it's never really
been used therapeutically,

00:09:59.440 --> 00:10:01.390 align:middle line:90%
because it's just--

00:10:01.390 --> 00:10:03.970 align:middle line:84%
it's so primitive
that it tends to turn

00:10:03.970 --> 00:10:05.902 align:middle line:84%
into all different
kinds of weird things.

00:10:05.902 --> 00:10:07.360 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Well,
that's interesting,

00:10:07.360 --> 00:10:09.360 align:middle line:84%
because a lot of people
are left with the notion

00:10:09.360 --> 00:10:11.110 align:middle line:84%
that embryonic
stem cells are used

00:10:11.110 --> 00:10:12.760 align:middle line:90%
in some of these therapies.

00:10:12.760 --> 00:10:15.280 align:middle line:84%
And what you just
said is interesting,

00:10:15.280 --> 00:10:17.950 align:middle line:84%
that it seems to have this
weird effect of turning

00:10:17.950 --> 00:10:19.760 align:middle line:90%
into all kinds of things.

00:10:19.760 --> 00:10:21.700 align:middle line:84%
Now, I think of it--
when I think of it,

00:10:21.700 --> 00:10:24.550 align:middle line:84%
it's an embryo is forming
into a human being

00:10:24.550 --> 00:10:28.640 align:middle line:84%
and has all this potential for
differentiation of these stem

00:10:28.640 --> 00:10:29.440 align:middle line:90%
cells.

00:10:29.440 --> 00:10:32.470 align:middle line:84%
And so are you saying that
from that point of view,

00:10:32.470 --> 00:10:34.230 align:middle line:84%
it's too chaotic and
incoherent still?

00:10:34.230 --> 00:10:36.730 align:middle line:84%
>>ADELSON: We don't know how
to put it on the right pathway,

00:10:36.730 --> 00:10:38.320 align:middle line:90%
because it's very complex.

00:10:38.320 --> 00:10:42.260 align:middle line:84%
When it's in nature and it's
an embryo turning into a fetus,

00:10:42.260 --> 00:10:44.590 align:middle line:90%
which then there's--

00:10:44.590 --> 00:10:48.650 align:middle line:84%
it knows which way to go in
God's infinite wisdom and all

00:10:48.650 --> 00:10:49.450 align:middle line:90%
that.

00:10:49.450 --> 00:10:52.033 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: But in looking at it
in a laboratory, it's like, ah!

00:10:52.033 --> 00:10:52.980 align:middle line:90%
>>ADELSON: Exactly.

00:10:52.980 --> 00:10:55.000 align:middle line:84%
We don't understand
the inner workings

00:10:55.000 --> 00:10:58.710 align:middle line:84%
well enough to ease it
in the right direction.

00:10:58.710 --> 00:10:59.510 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: OK.

00:10:59.510 --> 00:11:01.093 align:middle line:84%
>>ADELSON: So the
cells that we mostly

00:11:01.093 --> 00:11:04.032 align:middle line:84%
use therapeutically are what are
called mesenchymal stem cells.

00:11:04.032 --> 00:11:05.240 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: OK, what are those?

00:11:05.240 --> 00:11:06.657 align:middle line:84%
>>ADELSON: Mesenchymal
stem cells,

00:11:06.657 --> 00:11:10.880 align:middle line:84%
that phrase was coined by a
researcher named Arnold Caplan.

00:11:10.880 --> 00:11:14.450 align:middle line:84%
And he now says that he
wished he had called them

00:11:14.450 --> 00:11:17.240 align:middle line:90%
met medicinal signaling cells.

00:11:17.240 --> 00:11:19.100 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: That would
have been nicer.

00:11:19.100 --> 00:11:20.450 align:middle line:90%
Little easier on the tongue.

00:11:20.450 --> 00:11:21.450 align:middle line:90%
>>ADELSON: That's right.

00:11:21.450 --> 00:11:24.110 align:middle line:84%
And it's also more descriptive
of what it actually does.

00:11:24.110 --> 00:11:25.652 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So where
do they come from,

00:11:25.652 --> 00:11:27.240 align:middle line:90%
and how are they more coherent?

00:11:27.240 --> 00:11:28.040 align:middle line:90%
>>ADELSON: Sure.

00:11:28.040 --> 00:11:30.230 align:middle line:84%
So the thing to remember
about stem cells

00:11:30.230 --> 00:11:33.380 align:middle line:84%
is they have-- what defines
a stem cell is its ability

00:11:33.380 --> 00:11:37.490 align:middle line:84%
to either differentiate
or self-replicate.

00:11:37.490 --> 00:11:39.230 align:middle line:84%
When it self-replicates,
it turns

00:11:39.230 --> 00:11:41.180 align:middle line:90%
into another version of itself.

00:11:41.180 --> 00:11:45.230 align:middle line:84%
When it differentiates, it
turns into a target tissue cell.

00:11:45.230 --> 00:11:49.100 align:middle line:84%
We used to think that was the
main therapeutic application.

00:11:49.100 --> 00:11:52.200 align:middle line:84%
The mesenchymal stem cell has
a second superhuman power,

00:11:52.200 --> 00:11:55.160 align:middle line:84%
which is called
paracrine signaling,

00:11:55.160 --> 00:11:57.080 align:middle line:84%
or also called the
paracrine effect.

00:11:57.080 --> 00:11:59.780 align:middle line:84%
And what that is is
when a mesenchymal stem

00:11:59.780 --> 00:12:03.200 align:middle line:84%
cell comes into contact
with damaged cells.

00:12:03.200 --> 00:12:06.350 align:middle line:84%
It recognizes the fact that
it's in the presence of damaged

00:12:06.350 --> 00:12:08.990 align:middle line:84%
cells and it releases
growth factors

00:12:08.990 --> 00:12:12.260 align:middle line:84%
to signal to those
cells to heal themselves

00:12:12.260 --> 00:12:14.990 align:middle line:84%
for new, healthy
blood vessels to form.

00:12:14.990 --> 00:12:18.920 align:middle line:84%
And also, it fights
infection and inflammation.

00:12:18.920 --> 00:12:20.480 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Oh, OK.

00:12:20.480 --> 00:12:23.840 align:middle line:84%
Now, where are these
cells harvested from?

00:12:23.840 --> 00:12:25.920 align:middle line:84%
>>ADELSON: Where you find
mesenchymal stem cells,

00:12:25.920 --> 00:12:27.837 align:middle line:84%
you have to understand,
mesenchymal stem cells

00:12:27.837 --> 00:12:31.490 align:middle line:84%
are Superman, but they exist
in the Clark Kent form.

00:12:31.490 --> 00:12:35.630 align:middle line:84%
So before they become
mesenchymal stem cells,

00:12:35.630 --> 00:12:37.490 align:middle line:90%
they are pericytes.

00:12:37.490 --> 00:12:41.850 align:middle line:84%
Pericytes are the cells that
wrap around blood vessels.

00:12:41.850 --> 00:12:43.620 align:middle line:84%
So when you have
vasoconstriction

00:12:43.620 --> 00:12:45.860 align:middle line:84%
and vasodilation,
that's the action

00:12:45.860 --> 00:12:48.080 align:middle line:84%
of the pericytes
squeezing and relaxing

00:12:48.080 --> 00:12:49.260 align:middle line:90%
around the blood vessel.

00:12:49.260 --> 00:12:52.310 align:middle line:84%
When you have medications that
affect the blood pressure,

00:12:52.310 --> 00:12:55.250 align:middle line:84%
they're exerting their
effect on the pericytes.

00:12:55.250 --> 00:13:00.230 align:middle line:84%
When a pericyte-- when there's
an injury and a platelet

00:13:00.230 --> 00:13:03.960 align:middle line:84%
recognizes that it's no
longer inside a blood vessel,

00:13:03.960 --> 00:13:07.220 align:middle line:84%
it releases this
signaling protein,

00:13:07.220 --> 00:13:09.380 align:middle line:90%
platelet-derived growth factor.

00:13:09.380 --> 00:13:11.480 align:middle line:84%
When the pericyte
comes into contact

00:13:11.480 --> 00:13:13.340 align:middle line:84%
with platelet-derived
growth factor,

00:13:13.340 --> 00:13:16.790 align:middle line:84%
it detaches from the
blood vessel and morphs

00:13:16.790 --> 00:13:18.890 align:middle line:90%
into a mesenchymal stem cell.

00:13:18.890 --> 00:13:19.920 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Interesting.

00:13:19.920 --> 00:13:22.900 align:middle line:90%
Well, OK, how do you get them?

00:13:22.900 --> 00:13:23.900 align:middle line:90%
How do you harvest them?

00:13:23.900 --> 00:13:27.080 align:middle line:84%
>>ADELSON: Well, the two areas
where it's easy to harvest

00:13:27.080 --> 00:13:30.200 align:middle line:84%
and relatively easy to
concentrate and isolate

00:13:30.200 --> 00:13:33.140 align:middle line:84%
are from bone
marrow and from fat.

00:13:33.140 --> 00:13:34.550 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Like adipose tissue?

00:13:34.550 --> 00:13:35.350 align:middle line:90%
>>ADELSON: Yes.

00:13:35.350 --> 00:13:36.300 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:13:36.300 --> 00:13:38.810 align:middle line:84%
Which is kind of the brown
fat tissue of the body,

00:13:38.810 --> 00:13:42.590 align:middle line:84%
or-- is that the brown fat
tissue of the body, adipose?

00:13:42.590 --> 00:13:43.640 align:middle line:90%
Can be white or brown?

00:13:43.640 --> 00:13:44.090 align:middle line:90%
>>ADELSON: It can be either.

00:13:44.090 --> 00:13:44.570 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: OK.

00:13:44.570 --> 00:13:45.410 align:middle line:90%
All right.

00:13:45.410 --> 00:13:46.210 align:middle line:90%
All right.

00:13:46.210 --> 00:13:49.430 align:middle line:84%
So that I've heard
more about recently

00:13:49.430 --> 00:13:52.100 align:middle line:84%
in the field of kind
of beauty regeneration,

00:13:52.100 --> 00:13:54.230 align:middle line:84%
for example, where
you have doctors

00:13:54.230 --> 00:13:58.820 align:middle line:84%
who practice various
aesthetician type of procedures

00:13:58.820 --> 00:14:00.980 align:middle line:84%
beyond that,
cosmetic procedures.

00:14:00.980 --> 00:14:07.130 align:middle line:84%
And there's a whole field that's
blooming in terms of grooming

00:14:07.130 --> 00:14:09.428 align:middle line:90%
one's own stem cells to reuse.

00:14:09.428 --> 00:14:11.970 align:middle line:84%
I don't know how they do it or
what happens at the end of it,

00:14:11.970 --> 00:14:13.580 align:middle line:84%
but I think it's
intriguing, and I

00:14:13.580 --> 00:14:15.800 align:middle line:84%
would love to have you tell
us more about that in a minute

00:14:15.800 --> 00:14:16.340 align:middle line:90%
too.

00:14:16.340 --> 00:14:18.465 align:middle line:84%
But so now we're going to
go back to where you are,

00:14:18.465 --> 00:14:23.220 align:middle line:84%
which is pain, damage to
the body, worn out parts.

00:14:23.220 --> 00:14:27.530 align:middle line:84%
Do you find that the
stem cell therapy--

00:14:27.530 --> 00:14:29.720 align:middle line:84%
you're using the
mesenchymal cells--

00:14:29.720 --> 00:14:31.640 align:middle line:84%
work better on people
who are younger

00:14:31.640 --> 00:14:34.010 align:middle line:84%
and have tissue damage,
but their vital--

00:14:34.010 --> 00:14:36.530 align:middle line:84%
kind of their
vitality heals faster

00:14:36.530 --> 00:14:38.480 align:middle line:84%
and has a good
hold versus people

00:14:38.480 --> 00:14:40.070 align:middle line:90%
whose parts are wearing out?

00:14:40.070 --> 00:14:41.120 align:middle line:90%
Because I know one lady--

00:14:41.120 --> 00:14:42.560 align:middle line:90%
I'm just saying anecdotally--

00:14:42.560 --> 00:14:45.380 align:middle line:84%
I know one lady who is super
optimistic, wonderful, great

00:14:45.380 --> 00:14:47.810 align:middle line:84%
health, doing yoga
into her early 80s,

00:14:47.810 --> 00:14:49.400 align:middle line:84%
but her knees were
just worn out.

00:14:49.400 --> 00:14:51.170 align:middle line:84%
And she did a lot of
stem cell therapy,

00:14:51.170 --> 00:14:53.360 align:middle line:84%
and it seemed to work
for a little bit,

00:14:53.360 --> 00:14:55.110 align:middle line:90%
and then it didn't work anymore.

00:14:55.110 --> 00:14:57.470 align:middle line:84%
So let's talk about
the advantages

00:14:57.470 --> 00:14:59.540 align:middle line:84%
and where these
cutoff points are,

00:14:59.540 --> 00:15:02.250 align:middle line:84%
knowing that we're
all highly individual.

00:15:02.250 --> 00:15:03.050 align:middle line:90%
>>ADELSON: Right.

00:15:03.050 --> 00:15:05.632 align:middle line:84%
So I started out using
bone marrow stem cells,

00:15:05.632 --> 00:15:07.340 align:middle line:84%
because that's sort
of the gold standard.

00:15:07.340 --> 00:15:09.170 align:middle line:84%
It's what's been
around the longest.

00:15:09.170 --> 00:15:12.230 align:middle line:84%
Then I learned how
to lipoaspirate,

00:15:12.230 --> 00:15:15.290 align:middle line:84%
take small volumes of fat
and isolate the stem cells.

00:15:15.290 --> 00:15:16.910 align:middle line:90%
And I started combining the two.

00:15:16.910 --> 00:15:20.510 align:middle line:84%
And my experience is when you
combine bone marrow stem cells

00:15:20.510 --> 00:15:23.910 align:middle line:84%
with fat stem cells, that's
where I get the best results.

00:15:23.910 --> 00:15:27.350 align:middle line:84%
So for a period of years,
I would combine those two.

00:15:27.350 --> 00:15:32.120 align:middle line:84%
And what I found was that
patients under, say, 40 or 50

00:15:32.120 --> 00:15:34.130 align:middle line:90%
did consistently well.

00:15:34.130 --> 00:15:38.307 align:middle line:84%
But above the 40 to 50 range, it
was a little more hit or miss.

00:15:38.307 --> 00:15:40.640 align:middle line:84%
Sometimes people would do
great, and other times it just

00:15:40.640 --> 00:15:42.140 align:middle line:90%
didn't work as well.

00:15:42.140 --> 00:15:45.110 align:middle line:84%
Well, then exosomes
hit the scene.

00:15:45.110 --> 00:15:45.910 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Exosomes.

00:15:45.910 --> 00:15:46.710 align:middle line:90%
>>ADELSON: Yes.

00:15:46.710 --> 00:15:48.185 align:middle line:84%
So let's just back
up a little bit.

00:15:48.185 --> 00:15:52.430 align:middle line:84%
So with stem cells, there's
two main categories.

00:15:52.430 --> 00:15:55.610 align:middle line:84%
There's autologous, which
is from your own body,

00:15:55.610 --> 00:15:59.110 align:middle line:84%
and there's allogenic,
which is from a donor.

00:15:59.110 --> 00:16:01.210 align:middle line:84%
So when we're talking
about stem cells

00:16:01.210 --> 00:16:03.730 align:middle line:84%
from your bone marrow and
fat, that's autologous.

00:16:03.730 --> 00:16:06.640 align:middle line:84%
That's donor and recipient
are the same person.

00:16:06.640 --> 00:16:10.180 align:middle line:84%
What makes my stem cell,
52-year-old stem cells

00:16:10.180 --> 00:16:13.960 align:middle line:84%
is as we age, our own stem
cells lose the ability

00:16:13.960 --> 00:16:17.860 align:middle line:84%
to manufacture these vesicles
filled with growth factors that

00:16:17.860 --> 00:16:19.240 align:middle line:90%
are called exosomes.

00:16:19.240 --> 00:16:21.520 align:middle line:84%
That's actually the
active ingredient.

00:16:21.520 --> 00:16:24.010 align:middle line:84%
If we go back to
cellular biology 101

00:16:24.010 --> 00:16:26.980 align:middle line:84%
and we look at a cell,
it's the cell membrane

00:16:26.980 --> 00:16:29.230 align:middle line:90%
comprised of the bilipid layer.

00:16:29.230 --> 00:16:30.850 align:middle line:84%
Then you've got
the nucleus, which

00:16:30.850 --> 00:16:33.910 align:middle line:84%
contains the genetic
material, the Golgi

00:16:33.910 --> 00:16:36.580 align:middle line:84%
apparatus, and the
mitochondria, and then there's

00:16:36.580 --> 00:16:38.170 align:middle line:90%
these little vesicles.

00:16:38.170 --> 00:16:41.560 align:middle line:84%
And we used to think that
that was the cellular waste.

00:16:41.560 --> 00:16:43.960 align:middle line:84%
We used to think that that
was sort of cellular poop,

00:16:43.960 --> 00:16:44.950 align:middle line:90%
if you will.

00:16:44.950 --> 00:16:48.520 align:middle line:84%
Well, what we discovered is that
actually is the communicating

00:16:48.520 --> 00:16:50.590 align:middle line:84%
proteins that give
the mesenchymal stem

00:16:50.590 --> 00:16:54.760 align:middle line:84%
cells their ability to
perform the paracrine effect,

00:16:54.760 --> 00:16:56.680 align:middle line:90%
their paracrine signaling.

00:16:56.680 --> 00:17:01.660 align:middle line:84%
So as we age, what
makes my stem cells

00:17:01.660 --> 00:17:04.599 align:middle line:84%
52-year-old stem cells
is we lose the ability

00:17:04.599 --> 00:17:07.329 align:middle line:84%
to manufacture these
vesicles filled with growth

00:17:07.329 --> 00:17:09.849 align:middle line:90%
factors called exosomes.

00:17:09.849 --> 00:17:13.839 align:middle line:84%
So there are labs that
take these very young,

00:17:13.839 --> 00:17:16.839 align:middle line:90%
robust placental stem cells.

00:17:16.839 --> 00:17:17.710 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:17:17.710 --> 00:17:19.954 align:middle line:84%
And that's what-- you're
answering everything

00:17:19.954 --> 00:17:20.829 align:middle line:90%
before I'm asking it.

00:17:20.829 --> 00:17:23.330 align:middle line:84%
That's just the trajectory
I was hoping you'd go on.

00:17:23.330 --> 00:17:24.130 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:17:24.130 --> 00:17:26.330 align:middle line:84%
So now we're into
those placental cells.

00:17:26.330 --> 00:17:27.130 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:17:27.130 --> 00:17:29.310 align:middle line:84%
>>ADELSON: So either
placental or umbilical.

00:17:29.310 --> 00:17:29.680 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Umbilical.

00:17:29.680 --> 00:17:29.950 align:middle line:90%
Mm-hmm.

00:17:29.950 --> 00:17:32.800 align:middle line:84%
>>ADELSON: The only thing that
I'm not crazy about with those

00:17:32.800 --> 00:17:36.970 align:middle line:84%
types of cells is when you
give the whole stem cell,

00:17:36.970 --> 00:17:38.110 align:middle line:90%
you're giving--

00:17:38.110 --> 00:17:41.237 align:middle line:84%
you're introducing somebody
else's genetic material.

00:17:41.237 --> 00:17:43.570 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: That's what I was
going to ask about next too.

00:17:43.570 --> 00:17:44.510 align:middle line:90%
You're right on it.

00:17:44.510 --> 00:17:46.990 align:middle line:84%
So what happens in
terms of compatibility?

00:17:46.990 --> 00:17:50.150 align:middle line:84%
>>ADELSON: Well, we think it's
safe, but we really don't know,

00:17:50.150 --> 00:17:50.950 align:middle line:90%
you know?

00:17:50.950 --> 00:17:53.350 align:middle line:84%
It just hasn't been used
long enough to know for sure,

00:17:53.350 --> 00:17:54.150 align:middle line:90%
you know?

00:17:54.150 --> 00:17:59.600 align:middle line:84%
We think that they sort of are
immune to any sort of response.

00:17:59.600 --> 00:18:03.430 align:middle line:84%
However, you can have a
graft versus host disease

00:18:03.430 --> 00:18:06.680 align:middle line:84%
from a bone marrow transfusion,
like, two years later.

00:18:06.680 --> 00:18:09.490 align:middle line:84%
So I'm a little nervous
about using umbilical cord

00:18:09.490 --> 00:18:11.530 align:middle line:90%
or placental stem cells.

00:18:11.530 --> 00:18:14.457 align:middle line:84%
But with the exosomes, what
these laboratories do--

00:18:14.457 --> 00:18:16.540 align:middle line:84%
and the reason I prefer
it is because what they do

00:18:16.540 --> 00:18:19.990 align:middle line:84%
is they take these
young stem cells,

00:18:19.990 --> 00:18:22.870 align:middle line:84%
and they put them in a
stressful culture medium

00:18:22.870 --> 00:18:26.960 align:middle line:84%
to basically make the cell think
that its host is under duress.

00:18:26.960 --> 00:18:30.670 align:middle line:84%
So it manufactures and
excretes these exosomes.

00:18:30.670 --> 00:18:33.190 align:middle line:84%
Then they put it in a very
high-speed centrifuge.

00:18:33.190 --> 00:18:35.110 align:middle line:84%
Not just a normal
desktop centrifuge.

00:18:35.110 --> 00:18:36.820 align:middle line:90%
Big laboratory centrifuges.

00:18:36.820 --> 00:18:39.110 align:middle line:90%
The stem cells go to the bottom.

00:18:39.110 --> 00:18:40.760 align:middle line:90%
The exosomes go to the top.

00:18:40.760 --> 00:18:43.630 align:middle line:84%
So now you've separated
the active ingredient

00:18:43.630 --> 00:18:47.200 align:middle line:84%
from the other person's genetic
material, the cell where

00:18:47.200 --> 00:18:48.920 align:middle line:90%
the nucleus exists.

00:18:48.920 --> 00:18:52.000 align:middle line:84%
And what we do is
we add the exosomes

00:18:52.000 --> 00:18:54.550 align:middle line:90%
to the person's own stem cells.

00:18:54.550 --> 00:18:58.660 align:middle line:84%
And what we think happens is
that the stem cells envelop

00:18:58.660 --> 00:19:01.780 align:middle line:84%
these exosomes into
themselves, thereby

00:19:01.780 --> 00:19:04.480 align:middle line:84%
functionally making
the person's stem

00:19:04.480 --> 00:19:06.580 align:middle line:90%
cell that of a younger person.

00:19:06.580 --> 00:19:07.610 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Interesting.

00:19:07.610 --> 00:19:08.410 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:19:08.410 --> 00:19:09.857 align:middle line:90%
Now, I brought it up.

00:19:09.857 --> 00:19:11.440 align:middle line:84%
I just touched on
it a little bit ago.

00:19:11.440 --> 00:19:14.230 align:middle line:90%


00:19:14.230 --> 00:19:19.450 align:middle line:84%
When using the umbilical
cord stem cells, one area--

00:19:19.450 --> 00:19:22.690 align:middle line:84%
my understanding
that has grown is

00:19:22.690 --> 00:19:26.230 align:middle line:84%
harvesting that right
after birth and banking

00:19:26.230 --> 00:19:31.660 align:middle line:84%
it for the future of that
person, that child, that baby.

00:19:31.660 --> 00:19:35.030 align:middle line:84%
Have you-- what's
happened with that field?

00:19:35.030 --> 00:19:35.830 align:middle line:90%
>>ADELSON: Well,

00:19:35.830 --> 00:19:36.340 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: That makes--

00:19:36.340 --> 00:19:38.215 align:middle line:84%
>>ADELSON: That field
is very alive and well.

00:19:38.215 --> 00:19:41.178 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: It makes
sense, but does it?

00:19:41.178 --> 00:19:42.220 align:middle line:90%
I mean, how does it work?

00:19:42.220 --> 00:19:43.678 align:middle line:84%
>>ADELSON: The one
sort of downside

00:19:43.678 --> 00:19:47.200 align:middle line:84%
is that these stem cell banks
are very tightly regulated.

00:19:47.200 --> 00:19:51.100 align:middle line:84%
And really, the only way you
can withdraw the cells is it has

00:19:51.100 --> 00:19:55.120 align:middle line:84%
to be the person who donated
them comes down with a very

00:19:55.120 --> 00:19:59.080 align:middle line:84%
specific, short list of
diseases, usually cancer-type--

00:19:59.080 --> 00:20:00.495 align:middle line:90%
cancer-type conditions.

00:20:00.495 --> 00:20:01.370 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Oh, really?

00:20:01.370 --> 00:20:03.130 align:middle line:84%
So you can't use
it for your knees.

00:20:03.130 --> 00:20:05.120 align:middle line:84%
Like, you had it in
the bank for 60 years

00:20:05.120 --> 00:20:06.370 align:middle line:90%
and now your knees are going--

00:20:06.370 --> 00:20:07.450 align:middle line:90%
>>ADELSON: Unfortunately, no.

00:20:07.450 --> 00:20:08.560 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Oh, see,
that's interesting.

00:20:08.560 --> 00:20:09.280 align:middle line:90%
>>ADELSON: Yeah, unfortunately.

00:20:09.280 --> 00:20:11.863 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Why is it so-- why are
they regulating it so if it's

00:20:11.863 --> 00:20:14.290 align:middle line:90%
your body and your stem cells?

00:20:14.290 --> 00:20:16.330 align:middle line:84%
>>ADELSON: Well,
that's a good question.

00:20:16.330 --> 00:20:21.910 align:middle line:84%
The FDA considers your
cells to be a drug

00:20:21.910 --> 00:20:23.620 align:middle line:90%
and a non-FDA-approved drug.

00:20:23.620 --> 00:20:25.510 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Now,
let's talk about how

00:20:25.510 --> 00:20:28.270 align:middle line:84%
it can be used for spinal
injury and spinal damage

00:20:28.270 --> 00:20:31.660 align:middle line:84%
and degeneration,
because a lot of people

00:20:31.660 --> 00:20:33.690 align:middle line:84%
suffer from spinal
issues and pain.

00:20:33.690 --> 00:20:34.690 align:middle line:90%
>>ADELSON: That's right.

00:20:34.690 --> 00:20:39.070 align:middle line:84%
Low back pain is the leading
cause of disability worldwide.

00:20:39.070 --> 00:20:42.190 align:middle line:84%
If you look at the economic
impact of low back pain,

00:20:42.190 --> 00:20:46.840 align:middle line:84%
it's greater than heart disease,
diabetes, and cancer combined.

00:20:46.840 --> 00:20:49.540 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And doesn't that
put a lot of people into that

00:20:49.540 --> 00:20:53.390 align:middle line:90%
dangerous territory of a thing--

00:20:53.390 --> 00:20:55.240 align:middle line:90%
the opioid drugs?

00:20:55.240 --> 00:20:56.240 align:middle line:90%
>>ADELSON: Yes, exactly.

00:20:56.240 --> 00:20:58.120 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Range of drugs that
they can become habituated--

00:20:58.120 --> 00:20:58.720 align:middle line:90%
>>ADELSON: Exactly.

00:20:58.720 --> 00:20:59.520 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:20:59.520 --> 00:21:01.810 align:middle line:84%
>>ADELSON: Opioid drugs
are great for sort

00:21:01.810 --> 00:21:04.450 align:middle line:84%
of post-surgery
or acute injuries.

00:21:04.450 --> 00:21:07.150 align:middle line:84%
It's great for people
who are dying of cancer.

00:21:07.150 --> 00:21:11.350 align:middle line:84%
But as a long-term therapy for
low back pain, what it does is

00:21:11.350 --> 00:21:14.620 align:middle line:84%
it completely sets
your brain's ability

00:21:14.620 --> 00:21:19.580 align:middle line:84%
to interpret pain on its head
and lowers your pain threshold.

00:21:19.580 --> 00:21:21.220 align:middle line:84%
So even if your
pain isn't that bad,

00:21:21.220 --> 00:21:23.360 align:middle line:84%
if you take narcotics
long enough,

00:21:23.360 --> 00:21:26.170 align:middle line:84%
your pain threshold
goes so low that even

00:21:26.170 --> 00:21:29.200 align:middle line:84%
if the original cause of
the pain has resolved,

00:21:29.200 --> 00:21:30.240 align:middle line:90%
you're just in pain.

00:21:30.240 --> 00:21:31.210 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: You need
more and more.

00:21:31.210 --> 00:21:31.930 align:middle line:90%
>>ADELSON: Right.

00:21:31.930 --> 00:21:33.340 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And then
you have the crisis

00:21:33.340 --> 00:21:35.020 align:middle line:84%
that we have in this
country, for example.

00:21:35.020 --> 00:21:35.740 align:middle line:90%
>>ADELSON: Exactly.

00:21:35.740 --> 00:21:36.320 align:middle line:90%
Exactly.

00:21:36.320 --> 00:21:37.220 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: And-- yeah.

00:21:37.220 --> 00:21:38.020 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:21:38.020 --> 00:21:39.800 align:middle line:90%
So let's move beyond opioids.

00:21:39.800 --> 00:21:40.600 align:middle line:90%
>>ADELSON: Sure.

00:21:40.600 --> 00:21:43.570 align:middle line:84%
So one of the things to keep
in mind with low back pain

00:21:43.570 --> 00:21:48.040 align:middle line:84%
is if you look at MRIs of people
with no low back pain, people

00:21:48.040 --> 00:21:52.030 align:middle line:84%
who've never had low back
pain, 60% of those people

00:21:52.030 --> 00:21:54.790 align:middle line:90%
will have abnormalities on MRI.

00:21:54.790 --> 00:21:58.390 align:middle line:84%
15% will have abnormalities
so significant

00:21:58.390 --> 00:22:01.000 align:middle line:84%
that if they had corresponding
symptoms, which they

00:22:01.000 --> 00:22:04.030 align:middle line:84%
don't, they would be candidates
for immediate emergency

00:22:04.030 --> 00:22:05.770 align:middle line:90%
surgery.

00:22:05.770 --> 00:22:09.400 align:middle line:84%
Similarly, you'll see people
with terrible low back pain

00:22:09.400 --> 00:22:12.170 align:middle line:84%
whose MRIs looked
perfectly normal.

00:22:12.170 --> 00:22:16.510 align:middle line:10%
So this really calls into
question the value of the MRI.

00:22:16.510 --> 00:22:19.450 align:middle line:10%
In 2011, the American
College of Physicians,

00:22:19.450 --> 00:22:23.650 align:middle line:10%
which is like the granddaddy
of all medical organizations,

00:22:23.650 --> 00:22:26.890 align:middle line:10%
issued a position paper
discouraging doctors

00:22:26.890 --> 00:22:29.740 align:middle line:10%
from ordering MRI
for low back pain,

00:22:29.740 --> 00:22:32.920 align:middle line:10%
because all it really
does is send the patient

00:22:32.920 --> 00:22:36.730 align:middle line:10%
down some dangerous and
expensive rabbit holes.

00:22:36.730 --> 00:22:40.870 align:middle line:84%
It's been proven that performing
an MRI on low back pain, all

00:22:40.870 --> 00:22:43.750 align:middle line:84%
it does is guarantee that
the cost of the treatment

00:22:43.750 --> 00:22:45.010 align:middle line:90%
will be higher.

00:22:45.010 --> 00:22:47.950 align:middle line:84%
It doesn't improve
the outcomes at all.

00:22:47.950 --> 00:22:51.310 align:middle line:84%
The exceptions are if
somebody-- if you suspect cancer

00:22:51.310 --> 00:22:55.900 align:middle line:84%
or if someone has some sort of
neurologic deficit like a drop

00:22:55.900 --> 00:22:56.770 align:middle line:90%
foot.

00:22:56.770 --> 00:22:59.170 align:middle line:84%
But for just regular
low back pain,

00:22:59.170 --> 00:23:01.510 align:middle line:84%
the MRI gives you
all this information,

00:23:01.510 --> 00:23:04.280 align:middle line:84%
but most of that
information is not useful.

00:23:04.280 --> 00:23:08.080 align:middle line:84%
So that kind of makes us shift
from the macroscopic pain

00:23:08.080 --> 00:23:11.120 align:middle line:84%
generator to the
microscopic tissues.

00:23:11.120 --> 00:23:14.860 align:middle line:84%
And what we think, people in my
field in regenerative medicine,

00:23:14.860 --> 00:23:17.500 align:middle line:84%
we think most of
back pain is caused

00:23:17.500 --> 00:23:21.020 align:middle line:84%
by changes in the microscopic
connective tissue.

00:23:21.020 --> 00:23:24.910 align:middle line:84%
So you have irregularities
in the collagen matrix.

00:23:24.910 --> 00:23:29.590 align:middle line:84%
You have the hyper-production of
these irregularly formed blood

00:23:29.590 --> 00:23:30.490 align:middle line:90%
vessels.

00:23:30.490 --> 00:23:32.260 align:middle line:84%
Every time you grow
a new blood vessel,

00:23:32.260 --> 00:23:34.090 align:middle line:84%
you grow another sensory
nerve, so now you

00:23:34.090 --> 00:23:36.400 align:middle line:84%
have a hyper-concentration
of sensory nerves.

00:23:36.400 --> 00:23:39.280 align:middle line:84%
And these are irregularly
formed blood vessels.

00:23:39.280 --> 00:23:42.400 align:middle line:84%
So you've actually
lost the ability

00:23:42.400 --> 00:23:45.670 align:middle line:84%
to bring oxygen to the area
and metabolic waste away.

00:23:45.670 --> 00:23:49.090 align:middle line:84%
So it's almost like
a hypoxic pain.

00:23:49.090 --> 00:23:51.700 align:middle line:84%
So one of the things that
we know that stem cell

00:23:51.700 --> 00:23:55.300 align:middle line:84%
therapy does is turn
damaged scar tissue

00:23:55.300 --> 00:23:57.250 align:middle line:90%
into normal, healthy tissue.

00:23:57.250 --> 00:23:59.050 align:middle line:84%
And the reason we know
that is because one

00:23:59.050 --> 00:24:02.320 align:middle line:84%
of the areas that has the
strongest amount of research

00:24:02.320 --> 00:24:04.090 align:middle line:90%
is in wound care.

00:24:04.090 --> 00:24:05.950 align:middle line:84%
Wound care is very
easy to study,

00:24:05.950 --> 00:24:09.520 align:middle line:84%
because the person has an
ulcer, and either it heals or it

00:24:09.520 --> 00:24:10.320 align:middle line:90%
doesn't.

00:24:10.320 --> 00:24:10.780 align:middle line:90%
Right.

00:24:10.780 --> 00:24:12.880 align:middle line:84%
And what happens when
you inject stem cells

00:24:12.880 --> 00:24:15.410 align:middle line:84%
into a non-healing
ulcer is first you

00:24:15.410 --> 00:24:18.590 align:middle line:84%
grow these new, healthy
collagen matrixes,

00:24:18.590 --> 00:24:20.480 align:middle line:84%
you grow these
healthy blood vessels,

00:24:20.480 --> 00:24:22.880 align:middle line:90%
and then you grow skin over top.

00:24:22.880 --> 00:24:24.770 align:middle line:84%
So that's what we
think is happening.

00:24:24.770 --> 00:24:28.730 align:middle line:84%
The two areas where I find we
really get the best outcomes

00:24:28.730 --> 00:24:33.080 align:middle line:84%
are desiccated discs and
post-whiplash syndrome.

00:24:33.080 --> 00:24:37.640 align:middle line:84%
Desiccated disc is a dehydration
of the intervertebral disc.

00:24:37.640 --> 00:24:42.170 align:middle line:84%
A dry-- it's a dry disc, and
a dry disc is a painful disk.

00:24:42.170 --> 00:24:44.720 align:middle line:84%
When we put stem cells into
the intervertebral disc,

00:24:44.720 --> 00:24:47.730 align:middle line:84%
it's really my favorite thing
to treat for two reasons.

00:24:47.730 --> 00:24:50.150 align:middle line:84%
One, because the conventional
treatment is terrible.

00:24:50.150 --> 00:24:52.140 align:middle line:84%
The conventional treatment
really is fusion.

00:24:52.140 --> 00:24:54.110 align:middle line:84%
There is no good
conventional treatment.

00:24:54.110 --> 00:24:56.152 align:middle line:84%
And the other reason I
love it is because it just

00:24:56.152 --> 00:24:57.860 align:middle line:90%
seems to be so effective.

00:24:57.860 --> 00:25:01.070 align:middle line:84%
When I get these sort of
25-year-old, 35-year-old

00:25:01.070 --> 00:25:04.640 align:middle line:84%
with a weightlifting injury
and they've got this black disc

00:25:04.640 --> 00:25:08.120 align:middle line:84%
on MRI, meaning it's dehydrated,
conventionally, there's

00:25:08.120 --> 00:25:09.690 align:middle line:84%
really nothing to
be done for that.

00:25:09.690 --> 00:25:13.040 align:middle line:84%
And that's where I find stem
cell therapy really shines.

00:25:13.040 --> 00:25:15.680 align:middle line:84%
The other area's in
post-whiplash syndrome.

00:25:15.680 --> 00:25:17.570 align:middle line:84%
And post-whiplash
syndrome is sort of

00:25:17.570 --> 00:25:20.180 align:middle line:84%
like a tennis elbow
of your neck, right?

00:25:20.180 --> 00:25:22.670 align:middle line:84%
You have this chaotic
collagen matrixes.

00:25:22.670 --> 00:25:24.410 align:middle line:84%
You have this
hyper-concentration

00:25:24.410 --> 00:25:25.640 align:middle line:90%
of blood vessels.

00:25:25.640 --> 00:25:28.880 align:middle line:84%
It's just like scar
tissue in your neck.

00:25:28.880 --> 00:25:32.750 align:middle line:84%
And when we inject stem cells
into those soft tissues,

00:25:32.750 --> 00:25:35.180 align:middle line:84%
I find that very
frequently, people

00:25:35.180 --> 00:25:39.440 align:middle line:84%
get massive pain reduction,
increased quality of life,

00:25:39.440 --> 00:25:41.750 align:middle line:84%
and increased activities
of daily living.

00:25:41.750 --> 00:25:42.920 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Interesting.

00:25:42.920 --> 00:25:47.337 align:middle line:84%
Well, going back to the big
issue, the lower back pain--

00:25:47.337 --> 00:25:48.920 align:middle line:84%
I'm just going to
toss this out there.

00:25:48.920 --> 00:25:50.160 align:middle line:90%
You don't have to comment on it.

00:25:50.160 --> 00:25:52.285 align:middle line:84%
But I interview a lot of
different types of people.

00:25:52.285 --> 00:25:53.720 align:middle line:90%
The show's "Open Minds," right?

00:25:53.720 --> 00:25:57.050 align:middle line:84%
And I have interviewed
quite a few people that

00:25:57.050 --> 00:25:59.460 align:middle line:90%
do mind-body medicine as well.

00:25:59.460 --> 00:26:03.140 align:middle line:84%
And lower back pain is
the one most associated

00:26:03.140 --> 00:26:05.400 align:middle line:90%
with fear and insecurity.

00:26:05.400 --> 00:26:06.200 align:middle line:90%
A fear.

00:26:06.200 --> 00:26:08.480 align:middle line:84%
Just fear, fear,
fear where the being

00:26:08.480 --> 00:26:09.770 align:middle line:90%
starts collapsing into it.

00:26:09.770 --> 00:26:11.900 align:middle line:84%
Like, it can't hold its
own weight up anymore

00:26:11.900 --> 00:26:13.770 align:middle line:90%
on an emotional level.

00:26:13.770 --> 00:26:17.960 align:middle line:84%
Which I find interesting
next to what you just said,

00:26:17.960 --> 00:26:20.540 align:middle line:90%
because it's not obvious.

00:26:20.540 --> 00:26:22.520 align:middle line:84%
You can't tell from
physical symptoms

00:26:22.520 --> 00:26:24.390 align:middle line:84%
whether that should
be there or not.

00:26:24.390 --> 00:26:27.800 align:middle line:84%
So there's some other
underlying driving conditions

00:26:27.800 --> 00:26:31.740 align:middle line:84%
that are assisting the
development of that pain.

00:26:31.740 --> 00:26:34.230 align:middle line:10%
So that's a whole
separate subject,

00:26:34.230 --> 00:26:36.230 align:middle line:10%
but it's interesting,
because what you're saying

00:26:36.230 --> 00:26:37.800 align:middle line:10%
kind of validates that, right?

00:26:37.800 --> 00:26:38.600 align:middle line:90%
>>ADELSON: Yeah.

00:26:38.600 --> 00:26:40.820 align:middle line:84%
Well, there was a
very famous doctor

00:26:40.820 --> 00:26:42.675 align:middle line:84%
named John Sarno,
who unfortunately

00:26:42.675 --> 00:26:43.550 align:middle line:90%
is no longer with us.

00:26:43.550 --> 00:26:46.790 align:middle line:84%
But he did a lot of the
original research in a condition

00:26:46.790 --> 00:26:49.760 align:middle line:84%
that he termed tension
myositis syndrome.

00:26:49.760 --> 00:26:52.190 align:middle line:84%
And he felt that the
majority of low back pain

00:26:52.190 --> 00:26:55.790 align:middle line:84%
was caused by suppressed
emotions, specifically

00:26:55.790 --> 00:26:56.900 align:middle line:90%
suppressed anger.

00:26:56.900 --> 00:26:58.110 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Oh, interesting.

00:26:58.110 --> 00:27:00.320 align:middle line:84%
>>ADELSON: He actually
cured my dad of back pain.

00:27:00.320 --> 00:27:01.580 align:middle line:84%
And it's kind of a
long story, but--

00:27:01.580 --> 00:27:02.210 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Oh, I want to hear it.

00:27:02.210 --> 00:27:03.200 align:middle line:90%
This is interesting.

00:27:03.200 --> 00:27:05.930 align:middle line:84%
>>ADELSON: My dad had
this severe episode

00:27:05.930 --> 00:27:07.100 align:middle line:90%
of low back pain.

00:27:07.100 --> 00:27:10.593 align:middle line:84%
And I mean he was
really, really de--

00:27:10.593 --> 00:27:11.510 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Debilitated.

00:27:11.510 --> 00:27:11.900 align:middle line:90%
>>ADELSON: Thank you.

00:27:11.900 --> 00:27:12.260 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:27:12.260 --> 00:27:13.060 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHS]

00:27:13.060 --> 00:27:15.120 align:middle line:84%
>>ADELSON: He was
really debilitated,

00:27:15.120 --> 00:27:16.880 align:middle line:84%
and no one could
figure out what it was.

00:27:16.880 --> 00:27:19.070 align:middle line:84%
Well, it turns out at
the time, my grandmother

00:27:19.070 --> 00:27:21.740 align:middle line:84%
was really spiraling
into dementia.

00:27:21.740 --> 00:27:25.490 align:middle line:84%
And sort of deep down on
the subconscious level,

00:27:25.490 --> 00:27:29.420 align:middle line:84%
my dad was angry at his
mother for getting sick.

00:27:29.420 --> 00:27:30.350 align:middle line:90%
And that's sort of--

00:27:30.350 --> 00:27:32.270 align:middle line:84%
to say that out loud, it's
sort of terrible to say.

00:27:32.270 --> 00:27:34.562 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Well, I mean, and
did part of him almost feel

00:27:34.562 --> 00:27:37.530 align:middle line:84%
abandoned or burdened or all
those things that come with

00:27:37.530 --> 00:27:38.330 align:middle line:90%
Alzheimer's?

00:27:38.330 --> 00:27:39.320 align:middle line:90%
It's tough.

00:27:39.320 --> 00:27:40.653 align:middle line:90%
>>ADELSON: We'd have to ask him.

00:27:40.653 --> 00:27:44.450 align:middle line:84%
But once he recognized
that and sort of just

00:27:44.450 --> 00:27:47.512 align:middle line:84%
gave it a name, his back
pain completely resolved.

00:27:47.512 --> 00:27:48.470 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: There you go.

00:27:48.470 --> 00:27:49.928 align:middle line:84%
>>ADELSON: So I'm
a strong believer

00:27:49.928 --> 00:27:52.590 align:middle line:84%
that emotions absolutely
can cause back pain,

00:27:52.590 --> 00:27:54.380 align:middle line:90%
neck pain, any sort of pain.

00:27:54.380 --> 00:27:57.635 align:middle line:84%
I don't think it's the
only cause of back pain.

00:27:57.635 --> 00:28:00.680 align:middle line:84%
Some of my-- I get a
lot of combat veterans.

00:28:00.680 --> 00:28:03.590 align:middle line:84%
You know, guys who were blown
up in a Humvee and their spines

00:28:03.590 --> 00:28:04.520 align:middle line:90%
compressed.

00:28:04.520 --> 00:28:07.430 align:middle line:84%
I mean, and then they've
got a black disc on MRI.

00:28:07.430 --> 00:28:08.928 align:middle line:90%
So you know, I think--

00:28:08.928 --> 00:28:10.970 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Well, and even
just sleeping improperly

00:28:10.970 --> 00:28:14.690 align:middle line:84%
can cause a stress over time
that has this kind of buildup

00:28:14.690 --> 00:28:15.920 align:middle line:90%
you're talking about.

00:28:15.920 --> 00:28:19.520 align:middle line:84%
So OK, so that remains a little
bit elusive, lower back pain.

00:28:19.520 --> 00:28:22.190 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHS] OK.

00:28:22.190 --> 00:28:25.550 align:middle line:84%
So let's talk about
how stem cells

00:28:25.550 --> 00:28:29.660 align:middle line:84%
are used now in the field
of beauty regeneration.

00:28:29.660 --> 00:28:31.910 align:middle line:90%
I mean, holy cow.

00:28:31.910 --> 00:28:36.800 align:middle line:84%
I see people on TV and
I think, this woman

00:28:36.800 --> 00:28:40.160 align:middle line:84%
looks younger than she did
40 years ago, you know?

00:28:40.160 --> 00:28:42.110 align:middle line:84%
And there are a lot of
ways people do that,

00:28:42.110 --> 00:28:46.400 align:middle line:84%
and some of it's very
obvious and it's kind of--

00:28:46.400 --> 00:28:47.930 align:middle line:90%
they're unrecognizable.

00:28:47.930 --> 00:28:49.640 align:middle line:84%
But with others, I
think they're using

00:28:49.640 --> 00:28:51.350 align:middle line:90%
these more subtle techniques.

00:28:51.350 --> 00:28:55.130 align:middle line:84%
It's almost like they
just seem to stop aging.

00:28:55.130 --> 00:28:56.717 align:middle line:90%
What about stem cells?

00:28:56.717 --> 00:28:57.800 align:middle line:90%
You talked about that fat.

00:28:57.800 --> 00:29:01.190 align:middle line:84%
I know they do fat tissue
transplants, right?

00:29:01.190 --> 00:29:02.750 align:middle line:90%
Fat tissue transplants.

00:29:02.750 --> 00:29:05.060 align:middle line:84%
But also using--
harvesting those

00:29:05.060 --> 00:29:08.600 align:middle line:84%
stem cells to be used in
this regenerative process.

00:29:08.600 --> 00:29:10.850 align:middle line:84%
How does that work,
and what does it do?

00:29:10.850 --> 00:29:14.710 align:middle line:84%
And how is it used in the
field of beauty regeneration?

00:29:14.710 --> 00:29:15.510 align:middle line:90%
>>ADELSON: Sure.

00:29:15.510 --> 00:29:17.340 align:middle line:84%
So if you look at--
we have stem cells

00:29:17.340 --> 00:29:20.040 align:middle line:84%
in all the tissues in
our body, and their role

00:29:20.040 --> 00:29:23.500 align:middle line:84%
is to maintain the health
of their microenvironment.

00:29:23.500 --> 00:29:25.980 align:middle line:84%
So how healthy
you are is largely

00:29:25.980 --> 00:29:29.220 align:middle line:84%
determined by the function
of your stem cells

00:29:29.220 --> 00:29:31.780 align:middle line:84%
and the population
of stem cells.

00:29:31.780 --> 00:29:35.880 align:middle line:84%
So when we talk about the skin
of the face, for instance,

00:29:35.880 --> 00:29:36.720 align:middle line:90%
we have Botox.

00:29:36.720 --> 00:29:39.510 align:middle line:84%
And what Botox does is
it paralyzes the muscles

00:29:39.510 --> 00:29:42.727 align:middle line:84%
so you're unable to make these
lines of facial expression.

00:29:42.727 --> 00:29:44.310 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: You mean
these, my frownies?

00:29:44.310 --> 00:29:45.920 align:middle line:84%
I've got nice, deep
frownies there.

00:29:45.920 --> 00:29:46.955 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHS] Yep, I know.

00:29:46.955 --> 00:29:48.330 align:middle line:84%
>>ADELSON: And
then similarly you

00:29:48.330 --> 00:29:51.520 align:middle line:84%
have fillers, which
is to fill volume.

00:29:51.520 --> 00:29:53.430 align:middle line:84%
But what neither
of those address

00:29:53.430 --> 00:29:57.420 align:middle line:84%
is the actual health of
the skin, the hydration

00:29:57.420 --> 00:29:59.470 align:middle line:90%
and elasticity of the skin.

00:29:59.470 --> 00:30:01.950 align:middle line:84%
And I don't perform
cosmetic procedures,

00:30:01.950 --> 00:30:04.740 align:middle line:84%
but my practice partner,
Dr. Amy Killen, does.

00:30:04.740 --> 00:30:06.840 align:middle line:84%
And frequently we'll
do cases together

00:30:06.840 --> 00:30:08.850 align:middle line:84%
where I do the
musculoskeletal structures

00:30:08.850 --> 00:30:11.110 align:middle line:84%
and she does the
skin of the face.

00:30:11.110 --> 00:30:14.130 align:middle line:84%
And when you inject stem cells
into the skin of the face,

00:30:14.130 --> 00:30:17.530 align:middle line:84%
it improves elasticity
and hydration,

00:30:17.530 --> 00:30:20.670 align:middle line:84%
which doesn't give sort
of this dramatic look.

00:30:20.670 --> 00:30:22.307 align:middle line:84%
People just sort
of say, huh, you--

00:30:22.307 --> 00:30:23.640 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Look a little fresher.

00:30:23.640 --> 00:30:24.120 align:middle line:90%
Slept well.

00:30:24.120 --> 00:30:26.230 align:middle line:84%
>>ADELSON: Are you-- that's
exactly what they say.

00:30:26.230 --> 00:30:26.795 align:middle line:90%
That's exactly--

00:30:26.795 --> 00:30:27.680 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Are you rest--

00:30:27.680 --> 00:30:28.390 align:middle line:90%
You look rested.

00:30:28.390 --> 00:30:29.723 align:middle line:90%
>>ADELSON: That's exactly right.

00:30:29.723 --> 00:30:32.210 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So they're mostly
used in the skin then,

00:30:32.210 --> 00:30:35.550 align:middle line:84%
and the other things
are used for building.

00:30:35.550 --> 00:30:37.560 align:middle line:84%
>>ADELSON: Well, there's
actual fat transfers,

00:30:37.560 --> 00:30:39.600 align:middle line:84%
and that's using
fat as a filler,

00:30:39.600 --> 00:30:42.580 align:middle line:84%
and that's sort of more in
the realm of cosmetic surgery.

00:30:42.580 --> 00:30:44.400 align:middle line:84%
But I'm just talking
about putting skin--

00:30:44.400 --> 00:30:45.733 align:middle line:90%
stem cells in the skin.

00:30:45.733 --> 00:30:47.400 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Do they
inject it in the skin?

00:30:47.400 --> 00:30:49.514 align:middle line:84%
>>ADELSON: Inject
it into the skin.

00:30:49.514 --> 00:30:51.960 align:middle line:84%
She uses a microneedling
afterwards,

00:30:51.960 --> 00:30:54.727 align:middle line:84%
and then she usually uses
some sort of light therapy.

00:30:54.727 --> 00:30:56.310 align:middle line:84%
The other two
treatments that she does

00:30:56.310 --> 00:30:59.970 align:middle line:84%
is the scalp, which
thickens the hair follicles.

00:30:59.970 --> 00:31:02.503 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Oh, so that
might be popular with men.

00:31:02.503 --> 00:31:03.420 align:middle line:90%
More popular with men.

00:31:03.420 --> 00:31:05.100 align:middle line:84%
>>ADELSON: Oh, it's
equally popular with women

00:31:05.100 --> 00:31:05.880 align:middle line:90%
with thinning hair.

00:31:05.880 --> 00:31:06.650 align:middle line:90%
Sure.

00:31:06.650 --> 00:31:07.050 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:31:07.050 --> 00:31:08.760 align:middle line:84%
So just a thick--
now, it doesn't make

00:31:08.760 --> 00:31:10.860 align:middle line:90%
you grow new hair follicles.

00:31:10.860 --> 00:31:12.750 align:middle line:84%
But if you have follicles
that are producing

00:31:12.750 --> 00:31:15.120 align:middle line:90%
thin hair follicles, then--

00:31:15.120 --> 00:31:19.470 align:middle line:84%
or thin hair shafts, then
it thickens those shafts.

00:31:19.470 --> 00:31:22.360 align:middle line:84%
The other area is in
sexual optimization.

00:31:22.360 --> 00:31:23.160 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: How so?

00:31:23.160 --> 00:31:25.200 align:middle line:84%
>>ADELSON: She injects
in women in the vagina

00:31:25.200 --> 00:31:26.520 align:middle line:90%
and men in the penis.

00:31:26.520 --> 00:31:30.450 align:middle line:84%
What that does is in
the women, it improves--

00:31:30.450 --> 00:31:32.895 align:middle line:84%
just like with the face,
improves hydration--

00:31:32.895 --> 00:31:33.770 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Elasticity.

00:31:33.770 --> 00:31:34.380 align:middle line:90%
>>ADELSON: Elasticity.

00:31:34.380 --> 00:31:34.980 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: OK.

00:31:34.980 --> 00:31:35.780 align:middle line:90%
>>ADELSON: Right.

00:31:35.780 --> 00:31:38.680 align:middle line:84%
So that's when women have
painful sex, for instance,

00:31:38.680 --> 00:31:39.480 align:middle line:90%
it's usually--

00:31:39.480 --> 00:31:41.060 align:middle line:84%
it's loss of
elasticity and dryness.

00:31:41.060 --> 00:31:42.530 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So you can
use stem cells for that?

00:31:42.530 --> 00:31:42.990 align:middle line:90%
>>ADELSON: Yes.

00:31:42.990 --> 00:31:43.907 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Interesting.

00:31:43.907 --> 00:31:44.790 align:middle line:90%
>>ADELSON: Yes, yes.

00:31:44.790 --> 00:31:47.865 align:middle line:84%
And then in men,
erectile dysfunction

00:31:47.865 --> 00:31:49.380 align:middle line:90%
is a circulatory issue.

00:31:49.380 --> 00:31:52.590 align:middle line:84%
It's loss of-- it's loss
of microcirculation.

00:31:52.590 --> 00:31:55.800 align:middle line:84%
So just like we were talking
about earlier when you inject

00:31:55.800 --> 00:31:57.900 align:middle line:84%
in the penis, it
triggers the growth

00:31:57.900 --> 00:32:00.750 align:middle line:84%
of these new, healthy
blood vessels,

00:32:00.750 --> 00:32:03.750 align:middle line:84%
thereby directly
treating or preventing

00:32:03.750 --> 00:32:04.840 align:middle line:90%
erectile dysfunction.

00:32:04.840 --> 00:32:05.640 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Wow.

00:32:05.640 --> 00:32:07.230 align:middle line:84%
I hadn't even
heard of these yet.

00:32:07.230 --> 00:32:08.340 align:middle line:90%
This is amazing.

00:32:08.340 --> 00:32:09.140 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:32:09.140 --> 00:32:12.420 align:middle line:84%
So you're saying here,
we talked about this

00:32:12.420 --> 00:32:15.450 align:middle line:84%
a little earlier that once
you hit over 40 in particular,

00:32:15.450 --> 00:32:16.500 align:middle line:90%
you start losing--

00:32:16.500 --> 00:32:20.670 align:middle line:84%
you start losing the advantage
of the stem cells' ability

00:32:20.670 --> 00:32:21.810 align:middle line:90%
to produce.

00:32:21.810 --> 00:32:25.010 align:middle line:84%
We talked about the
exosomes, right?

00:32:25.010 --> 00:32:25.810 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:32:25.810 --> 00:32:26.400 align:middle line:90%
All right.

00:32:26.400 --> 00:32:28.608 align:middle line:84%
I'm just trying to pay
attention and follow you here.

00:32:28.608 --> 00:32:31.980 align:middle line:84%
So if you're over 40 years old--
and our demographic is anywhere

00:32:31.980 --> 00:32:37.163 align:middle line:84%
from 20s up to 60s, even 70, and
people are interested in this--

00:32:37.163 --> 00:32:38.580 align:middle line:84%
then you would
really kind of have

00:32:38.580 --> 00:32:41.430 align:middle line:84%
to look at using other
people's base stem cell?

00:32:41.430 --> 00:32:44.130 align:middle line:84%
>>ADELSON: Well, pretty much
with everybody now we combine.

00:32:44.130 --> 00:32:44.520 align:middle line:90%
I do what--

00:32:44.520 --> 00:32:46.260 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: You do the combination
you spoke of earlier?

00:32:46.260 --> 00:32:47.550 align:middle line:84%
>>ADELSON: Yes, what
I affectionately would

00:32:47.550 --> 00:32:49.320 align:middle line:90%
call the kitchen sink approach.

00:32:49.320 --> 00:32:52.350 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So the adipose
tissue drawn ones

00:32:52.350 --> 00:32:53.663 align:middle line:90%
combined with bone marrow.

00:32:53.663 --> 00:32:55.080 align:middle line:84%
>>ADELSON: Combined
with exosomes.

00:32:55.080 --> 00:32:55.880 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Oh, OK.

00:32:55.880 --> 00:32:57.330 align:middle line:90%
>>ADELSON: I find that even be--

00:32:57.330 --> 00:33:00.630 align:middle line:84%
so on the one hand, what I
found is when we supplement

00:33:00.630 --> 00:33:04.590 align:middle line:84%
a person's own stem cells with
exosomes, the thing that I

00:33:04.590 --> 00:33:08.850 align:middle line:84%
noticed sort of long
term is the older people

00:33:08.850 --> 00:33:10.800 align:middle line:90%
react like the younger people.

00:33:10.800 --> 00:33:13.740 align:middle line:84%
But even in the younger
people what I notice is people

00:33:13.740 --> 00:33:17.070 align:middle line:84%
have much less
post-procedure pain.

00:33:17.070 --> 00:33:20.100 align:middle line:84%
We do all our procedures
under IV sedation administered

00:33:20.100 --> 00:33:22.320 align:middle line:84%
by a board-certified
anesthesiologist,

00:33:22.320 --> 00:33:23.530 align:middle line:90%
so we put people to sleep.

00:33:23.530 --> 00:33:24.870 align:middle line:90%
It's very painful to go through.

00:33:24.870 --> 00:33:26.578 align:middle line:84%
There's no reason to
go through it awake.

00:33:26.578 --> 00:33:28.260 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Oh,
like, bone marrow--

00:33:28.260 --> 00:33:29.320 align:middle line:90%
>>ADELSON: All of it.

00:33:29.320 --> 00:33:30.120 align:middle line:90%
All of it.

00:33:30.120 --> 00:33:31.230 align:middle line:90%
Disc injections.

00:33:31.230 --> 00:33:32.030 align:middle line:90%
Like, all of it.

00:33:32.030 --> 00:33:32.430 align:middle line:90%
It's--

00:33:32.430 --> 00:33:33.600 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: I would think so.

00:33:33.600 --> 00:33:34.690 align:middle line:90%
Better to be asleep.

00:33:34.690 --> 00:33:35.880 align:middle line:84%
>>ADELSON: Yeah, it's
much better to be--

00:33:35.880 --> 00:33:36.630 align:middle line:90%
I don't need your help.

00:33:36.630 --> 00:33:37.560 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: [LAUGHS] Yeah.

00:33:37.560 --> 00:33:38.360 align:middle line:90%
>>ADELSON: Yeah.

00:33:38.360 --> 00:33:41.460 align:middle line:84%
So people, before I started
using exosomes, when people

00:33:41.460 --> 00:33:45.060 align:middle line:84%
would wake up, about
one in 10, one in 20

00:33:45.060 --> 00:33:47.280 align:middle line:84%
would wake up with
quite a bit of pain.

00:33:47.280 --> 00:33:50.550 align:middle line:84%
Quite a bit sore in the
area that we treated.

00:33:50.550 --> 00:33:52.740 align:middle line:84%
Once I started using
exosomes, what I found

00:33:52.740 --> 00:33:54.960 align:middle line:90%
is that almost entirely stopped.

00:33:54.960 --> 00:33:58.590 align:middle line:84%
The exosomes have a very strong
anti-inflammatory property,

00:33:58.590 --> 00:34:00.570 align:middle line:90%
and I think that's the cause.

00:34:00.570 --> 00:34:01.570 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Interesting.

00:34:01.570 --> 00:34:02.370 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:34:02.370 --> 00:34:03.990 align:middle line:90%
Let's move on then.

00:34:03.990 --> 00:34:07.380 align:middle line:84%
Thank you for explaining this,
and I have a much better idea

00:34:07.380 --> 00:34:08.760 align:middle line:90%
of how this works myself.

00:34:08.760 --> 00:34:11.520 align:middle line:84%
And I love your kitchen
sink approach to it.

00:34:11.520 --> 00:34:13.659 align:middle line:90%
It works, it sounds like.

00:34:13.659 --> 00:34:18.280 align:middle line:84%
Now here, you're talking
about you appreciating David--

00:34:18.280 --> 00:34:19.960 align:middle line:84%
you appreciate
David Asprey's work,

00:34:19.960 --> 00:34:21.820 align:middle line:84%
and I have interviewed
him before.

00:34:21.820 --> 00:34:23.199 align:middle line:90%
But now he's on to stem cells.

00:34:23.199 --> 00:34:24.730 align:middle line:90%
What's this called?

00:34:24.730 --> 00:34:27.610 align:middle line:84%
It's called the full-body
stem cell makeover.

00:34:27.610 --> 00:34:28.690 align:middle line:90%
What's that all about?

00:34:28.690 --> 00:34:29.739 align:middle line:90%
Why does it intrigue you?

00:34:29.739 --> 00:34:31.090 align:middle line:90%
Because Dave Asprey's out there.

00:34:31.090 --> 00:34:32.889 align:middle line:84%
He's a good marketer,
so bunch of people

00:34:32.889 --> 00:34:34.210 align:middle line:90%
will start hearing about this.

00:34:34.210 --> 00:34:35.980 align:middle line:84%
What's his take on it,
what's he offering,

00:34:35.980 --> 00:34:37.210 align:middle line:90%
and what are you intrigued with?

00:34:37.210 --> 00:34:38.010 align:middle line:90%
>>ADELSON: Sure.

00:34:38.010 --> 00:34:40.810 align:middle line:84%
So when I started
doing stem cells,

00:34:40.810 --> 00:34:44.350 align:middle line:84%
I was mostly getting
ranchers and oilfield workers

00:34:44.350 --> 00:34:45.190 align:middle line:90%
and cowboys.

00:34:45.190 --> 00:34:48.130 align:middle line:84%
I was getting these people who
literally just had arthritis

00:34:48.130 --> 00:34:49.750 align:middle line:90%
throughout their entire bodies.

00:34:49.750 --> 00:34:50.770 align:middle line:90%
So I started doing--

00:34:50.770 --> 00:34:52.659 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Ever get
anyone from the rodeo?

00:34:52.659 --> 00:34:53.770 align:middle line:84%
>>ADELSON: Oh, I had
quite a few rodeo--

00:34:53.770 --> 00:34:54.330 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Did you?

00:34:54.330 --> 00:34:54.610 align:middle line:90%
Oh my god.

00:34:54.610 --> 00:34:55.179 align:middle line:84%
>>ADELSON: I had
quite a few rodeo--

00:34:55.179 --> 00:34:56.012 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Oh my god.

00:34:56.012 --> 00:34:58.420 align:middle line:84%
>>ADELSON: Not so much active,
but more the retired guys.

00:34:58.420 --> 00:34:59.950 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Well-- oh, yeah
the problem's afterward.

00:34:59.950 --> 00:35:00.680 align:middle line:90%
>>ADELSON: Oh, yeah.

00:35:00.680 --> 00:35:00.790 align:middle line:90%
Oh, yeah.

00:35:00.790 --> 00:35:01.690 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: I can't even fathom.

00:35:01.690 --> 00:35:04.180 align:middle line:84%
>>ADELSON: They're busted up
cowboys and they have arthritis

00:35:04.180 --> 00:35:04.690 align:middle line:90%
throughout their entire--

00:35:04.690 --> 00:35:06.710 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So you worked
on the really tough cases.

00:35:06.710 --> 00:35:07.120 align:middle line:90%
>>ADELSON: Mostly, yeah.

00:35:07.120 --> 00:35:08.050 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Continue
what you were saying.

00:35:08.050 --> 00:35:08.830 align:middle line:90%
Sorry to interrupt.

00:35:08.830 --> 00:35:11.288 align:middle line:84%
>>ADELSON: And that's just sort
of how my practice evolved,

00:35:11.288 --> 00:35:13.750 align:middle line:84%
because in the early days,
you know, back in 2010, 2011,

00:35:13.750 --> 00:35:15.610 align:middle line:90%
no one had heard of stem cells.

00:35:15.610 --> 00:35:20.140 align:middle line:84%
Well, there was this large
animal vet in Wyoming who

00:35:20.140 --> 00:35:21.850 align:middle line:90%
was doing stem cells on horses.

00:35:21.850 --> 00:35:23.270 align:middle line:84%
And these cowboys
would say, well,

00:35:23.270 --> 00:35:24.400 align:middle line:90%
can't you just do it on me?

00:35:24.400 --> 00:35:25.483 align:middle line:90%
And he'd say, no, I can't.

00:35:25.483 --> 00:35:27.520 align:middle line:84%
But there's a guy in
Park City who does it.

00:35:27.520 --> 00:35:29.150 align:middle line:84%
So he was sending
me all these people.

00:35:29.150 --> 00:35:31.960 align:middle line:84%
So that's why I sort of were
getting all these busted

00:35:31.960 --> 00:35:33.070 align:middle line:90%
up cowboys.

00:35:33.070 --> 00:35:34.450 align:middle line:90%
And I do these big treatments.

00:35:34.450 --> 00:35:36.970 align:middle line:84%
I'd do their whole spine and
both shoulders and both hips--

00:35:36.970 --> 00:35:37.540 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Their legs.

00:35:37.540 --> 00:35:38.410 align:middle line:90%
Their-- yeah, the whole--

00:35:38.410 --> 00:35:39.993 align:middle line:84%
>>ADELSON: And I
sort of just jokingly

00:35:39.993 --> 00:35:42.490 align:middle line:84%
started calling it the
full-body stem cell makeover.

00:35:42.490 --> 00:35:48.850 align:middle line:84%
So then in 2016-- early 2016,
Dave Asprey became a patient.

00:35:48.850 --> 00:35:50.792 align:middle line:84%
And if you know
Dave Asprey, his--

00:35:50.792 --> 00:35:52.000 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Bulletproof coffee.

00:35:52.000 --> 00:35:54.180 align:middle line:84%
That's what most people
associate him with.

00:35:54.180 --> 00:35:55.180 align:middle line:90%
>>ADELSON: That's right.

00:35:55.180 --> 00:35:59.710 align:middle line:84%
And what he-- his goal
is to live to be 180.

00:35:59.710 --> 00:36:02.710 align:middle line:84%
And so I started
getting his devotees.

00:36:02.710 --> 00:36:04.695 align:middle line:84%
I started getting
his people in there.

00:36:04.695 --> 00:36:06.070 align:middle line:84%
And they are much
more interested

00:36:06.070 --> 00:36:08.142 align:middle line:84%
in sort of prevention
and anti-aging

00:36:08.142 --> 00:36:09.100 align:middle line:90%
and that sort of thing.

00:36:09.100 --> 00:36:10.270 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: How do you
approach that where

00:36:10.270 --> 00:36:11.520 align:middle line:90%
you have healthy young people?

00:36:11.520 --> 00:36:13.672 align:middle line:84%
Where do you start
doing the injections?

00:36:13.672 --> 00:36:15.130 align:middle line:84%
>>ADELSON: Well,
that's exactly it.

00:36:15.130 --> 00:36:16.713 align:middle line:84%
And then they started
asking me, well,

00:36:16.713 --> 00:36:18.560 align:middle line:84%
can't you just
inject my whole body?

00:36:18.560 --> 00:36:19.360 align:middle line:90%
And I thought--

00:36:19.360 --> 00:36:20.740 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Just mainline it?

00:36:20.740 --> 00:36:21.580 align:middle line:90%
Give me an IV?

00:36:21.580 --> 00:36:23.650 align:middle line:84%
>>ADELSON: Well, the
thing is if you do an IV,

00:36:23.650 --> 00:36:26.070 align:middle line:84%
it doesn't go to the
musculoskeletal structures.

00:36:26.070 --> 00:36:28.323 align:middle line:84%
It just-- it goes to the
internal organs, which

00:36:28.323 --> 00:36:29.123 align:middle line:90%
is great.

00:36:29.123 --> 00:36:30.520 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: So what do you do?

00:36:30.520 --> 00:36:33.610 align:middle line:84%
>>ADELSON: So I thought,
yeah, actually, I can.

00:36:33.610 --> 00:36:37.660 align:middle line:84%
I started thinking about
Dave's goal to live to be 180.

00:36:37.660 --> 00:36:40.990 align:middle line:84%
And you know, I think the
oldest recorded living person

00:36:40.990 --> 00:36:42.197 align:middle line:90%
made it to 125.

00:36:42.197 --> 00:36:43.780 align:middle line:84%
And if you looked
at pictures of them,

00:36:43.780 --> 00:36:45.927 align:middle line:84%
they look like a dried up,
arthritic prune, right?

00:36:45.927 --> 00:36:47.260 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah, a little raisin.

00:36:47.260 --> 00:36:49.060 align:middle line:84%
>>ADELSON: So I was
thinking, in order

00:36:49.060 --> 00:36:52.810 align:middle line:84%
to do that, you would have
to be very active right

00:36:52.810 --> 00:36:55.218 align:middle line:84%
up to the bitter end,
and that means you

00:36:55.218 --> 00:36:56.510 align:middle line:90%
need to have good joint health.

00:36:56.510 --> 00:37:00.280 align:middle line:84%
So that was where the true
full-body stem cell makeover

00:37:00.280 --> 00:37:01.720 align:middle line:90%
was born, where we just--

00:37:01.720 --> 00:37:03.370 align:middle line:84%
whether the person
needs it or not,

00:37:03.370 --> 00:37:05.650 align:middle line:84%
do the entire spine
at every level.

00:37:05.650 --> 00:37:07.000 align:middle line:90%
Turn the person over.

00:37:07.000 --> 00:37:09.970 align:middle line:84%
Both shoulders, both elbows,
both wrists and thumbs,

00:37:09.970 --> 00:37:12.857 align:middle line:84%
both knees, both hips,
both ankles, and great--

00:37:12.857 --> 00:37:13.690 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Oh my god.

00:37:13.690 --> 00:37:16.210 align:middle line:84%
So now you have been
doing this for a while.

00:37:16.210 --> 00:37:17.170 align:middle line:90%
A few years.

00:37:17.170 --> 00:37:18.700 align:middle line:84%
>>ADELSON: Coming
up on three years.

00:37:18.700 --> 00:37:20.137 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: What are you seeing?

00:37:20.137 --> 00:37:21.220 align:middle line:90%
>>ADELSON: People love it.

00:37:21.220 --> 00:37:23.012 align:middle line:84%
People-- I mean, I get
two types of people.

00:37:23.012 --> 00:37:25.112 align:middle line:84%
I get the busted up
cowboys who have pain

00:37:25.112 --> 00:37:26.320 align:middle line:90%
throughout their entire body.

00:37:26.320 --> 00:37:27.130 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: And the optimizers.

00:37:27.130 --> 00:37:29.255 align:middle line:84%
>>ADELSON: And then I get
the people who don't ever

00:37:29.255 --> 00:37:30.130 align:middle line:90%
want to get there.

00:37:30.130 --> 00:37:33.370 align:middle line:84%
They just-- and
people really love it.

00:37:33.370 --> 00:37:34.990 align:middle line:84%
And people have the
option of having

00:37:34.990 --> 00:37:36.760 align:middle line:90%
Amy Killen do all of her stuff.

00:37:36.760 --> 00:37:40.300 align:middle line:84%
The cosmetic of the face, the
scalp, and the sexual organs.

00:37:40.300 --> 00:37:41.350 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Wow.

00:37:41.350 --> 00:37:44.050 align:middle line:84%
This sounds
extraordinarily expensive.

00:37:44.050 --> 00:37:45.640 align:middle line:90%
>>ADELSON: Unfortunately, it is.

00:37:45.640 --> 00:37:47.480 align:middle line:90%
My center is expensive to run.

00:37:47.480 --> 00:37:48.280 align:middle line:90%
I mean, there's--

00:37:48.280 --> 00:37:50.180 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Yeah, I mean,
you have to have--

00:37:50.180 --> 00:37:51.888 align:middle line:84%
because that's not
covered by your health

00:37:51.888 --> 00:37:52.825 align:middle line:90%
insurance or your HMO.

00:37:52.825 --> 00:37:53.170 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHS]

00:37:53.170 --> 00:37:54.690 align:middle line:84%
>>ADELSON: No, the full-body
stem cell makeover--

00:37:54.690 --> 00:37:56.000 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Oh, god.

00:37:56.000 --> 00:37:56.930 align:middle line:90%
I can't even fathom.

00:37:56.930 --> 00:37:58.240 align:middle line:90%
>>ADELSON: It is.

00:37:58.240 --> 00:38:04.870 align:middle line:84%
So I actually had an experience
on Christmas Eve of 2016.

00:38:04.870 --> 00:38:06.520 align:middle line:84%
I was-- I had this
very long year.

00:38:06.520 --> 00:38:07.960 align:middle line:84%
Dave Asprey had
become a patient.

00:38:07.960 --> 00:38:09.640 align:middle line:90%
My practice suddenly--

00:38:09.640 --> 00:38:10.570 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Exploded.

00:38:10.570 --> 00:38:11.370 align:middle line:90%
>>ADELSON: Yeah.

00:38:11.370 --> 00:38:13.180 align:middle line:84%
I mean, sort of as
old Vidal Sassoon

00:38:13.180 --> 00:38:15.808 align:middle line:84%
said, I worked my fingers
to the bone for 20 years

00:38:15.808 --> 00:38:17.350 align:middle line:84%
and then became an
overnight success.

00:38:17.350 --> 00:38:18.370 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Exactly.

00:38:18.370 --> 00:38:21.130 align:middle line:84%
>>ADELSON: And I was
tired, and I'd been tired

00:38:21.130 --> 00:38:22.910 align:middle line:90%
for a couple of months.

00:38:22.910 --> 00:38:25.120 align:middle line:84%
And my wife came in and
asked me a question,

00:38:25.120 --> 00:38:29.427 align:middle line:84%
and I had lost the
ability to speak.

00:38:29.427 --> 00:38:30.260 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Literally.

00:38:30.260 --> 00:38:30.950 align:middle line:90%
>>ADELSON: Yeah.

00:38:30.950 --> 00:38:33.290 align:middle line:84%
And the right side of my body
was completely paralyzed.

00:38:33.290 --> 00:38:37.518 align:middle line:84%
So she took me to the hospital,
and I kept having strokes,

00:38:37.518 --> 00:38:38.810 align:middle line:90%
and we couldn't figure out why.

00:38:38.810 --> 00:38:41.180 align:middle line:84%
It took about three days to
diagnose it, and it was--

00:38:41.180 --> 00:38:43.850 align:middle line:84%
I had a bacterial
infection of my heart

00:38:43.850 --> 00:38:45.890 align:middle line:84%
that was kicking up
debris into my brain.

00:38:45.890 --> 00:38:46.730 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: That
must have scared--

00:38:46.730 --> 00:38:48.440 align:middle line:84%
>>ADELSON: So the surgeon
burst into the room.

00:38:48.440 --> 00:38:50.120 align:middle line:84%
And he said, well, the
good news is we figured out

00:38:50.120 --> 00:38:51.287 align:middle line:90%
why you keep having strokes.

00:38:51.287 --> 00:38:53.810 align:middle line:84%
The bad news is you need
aortic valve replacement

00:38:53.810 --> 00:38:58.040 align:middle line:84%
in two weeks, which I
found out years later,

00:38:58.040 --> 00:39:00.260 align:middle line:84%
it was probably from
bad dental work.

00:39:00.260 --> 00:39:02.370 align:middle line:84%
But you know, at the
time, I had no idea.

00:39:02.370 --> 00:39:03.830 align:middle line:90%
It just was-- it seemed crazy.

00:39:03.830 --> 00:39:07.125 align:middle line:84%
So I had this open heart
surgery with a sternotomy.

00:39:07.125 --> 00:39:08.000 align:middle line:90%
They cracked me open.

00:39:08.000 --> 00:39:10.415 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And you were only
in your late 40s at that time,

00:39:10.415 --> 00:39:10.580 align:middle line:90%
right?

00:39:10.580 --> 00:39:11.150 align:middle line:90%
>>ADELSON: Yeah, that's right.

00:39:11.150 --> 00:39:11.950 align:middle line:90%
Yeah, that's right.

00:39:11.950 --> 00:39:14.300 align:middle line:90%
It was just five years ago.

00:39:14.300 --> 00:39:15.940 align:middle line:90%
Or-- yeah, I guess.

00:39:15.940 --> 00:39:16.820 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:39:16.820 --> 00:39:18.630 align:middle line:90%
>>ADELSON: Yeah, five years ago.

00:39:18.630 --> 00:39:23.810 align:middle line:84%
So the result of having
the surgery was I

00:39:23.810 --> 00:39:29.570 align:middle line:84%
experienced pain that was
a 10 on a scale of 10.

00:39:29.570 --> 00:39:31.650 align:middle line:90%
And that was a gift.

00:39:31.650 --> 00:39:34.340 align:middle line:84%
It didn't feel like
a gift at the time.

00:39:34.340 --> 00:39:36.890 align:middle line:84%
But what I realized
is that the ability

00:39:36.890 --> 00:39:41.930 align:middle line:84%
to get people out of pain is
the greatest gift imaginable.

00:39:41.930 --> 00:39:45.740 align:middle line:84%
So that is what launched my
tithing program, because these

00:39:45.740 --> 00:39:46.880 align:middle line:90%
are expensive treatments.

00:39:46.880 --> 00:39:50.630 align:middle line:84%
And the greatest advance
in medicine in the world

00:39:50.630 --> 00:39:53.150 align:middle line:84%
doesn't do anybody any good
if they can't afford it.

00:39:53.150 --> 00:39:55.970 align:middle line:84%
So my tithing program,
one day per month,

00:39:55.970 --> 00:39:58.880 align:middle line:84%
I treat people who otherwise
couldn't afford it.

00:39:58.880 --> 00:40:00.440 align:middle line:84%
First, we determine
that the person

00:40:00.440 --> 00:40:01.932 align:middle line:90%
is living below poverty level.

00:40:01.932 --> 00:40:03.890 align:middle line:84%
Right, once we've determined
that, then there's

00:40:03.890 --> 00:40:07.080 align:middle line:84%
two pathways for
enrollment in the program.

00:40:07.080 --> 00:40:09.050 align:middle line:90%
One is combat service veterans.

00:40:09.050 --> 00:40:11.420 align:middle line:84%
If you've served this
country in combat,

00:40:11.420 --> 00:40:13.310 align:middle line:90%
I'm happy to do it at no cost.

00:40:13.310 --> 00:40:15.770 align:middle line:84%
For people who are not
combat service veterans,

00:40:15.770 --> 00:40:18.920 align:middle line:84%
I will do it in exchange
for documentation

00:40:18.920 --> 00:40:20.660 align:middle line:90%
of community service hours.

00:40:20.660 --> 00:40:21.800 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Wonderful.

00:40:21.800 --> 00:40:23.260 align:middle line:90%
>>ADELSON: It's been terrific.

00:40:23.260 --> 00:40:23.780 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: That is.

00:40:23.780 --> 00:40:24.590 align:middle line:90%
That's really--

00:40:24.590 --> 00:40:26.155 align:middle line:90%
>>ADELSON: It's so much fun.

00:40:26.155 --> 00:40:27.030 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Absolutely.

00:40:27.030 --> 00:40:28.260 align:middle line:90%
And you're so right.

00:40:28.260 --> 00:40:31.820 align:middle line:84%
If you've been around people
who-- or if you've had pain,

00:40:31.820 --> 00:40:34.580 align:middle line:84%
it just diminishes the
quality of engagement

00:40:34.580 --> 00:40:35.560 align:middle line:90%
with life, period.

00:40:35.560 --> 00:40:37.130 align:middle line:90%
There's no other way around it.

00:40:37.130 --> 00:40:39.900 align:middle line:84%
That's something people
cannot really bypass.

00:40:39.900 --> 00:40:40.700 align:middle line:90%
>>ADELSON: Yeah.

00:40:40.700 --> 00:40:43.040 align:middle line:84%
Yeah, the thing
about pain is one

00:40:43.040 --> 00:40:47.190 align:middle line:84%
of the predictors of longevity
is having a purpose in life.

00:40:47.190 --> 00:40:47.990 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:40:47.990 --> 00:40:50.270 align:middle line:84%
>>ADELSON: Well, if your
purpose in life in any way

00:40:50.270 --> 00:40:54.020 align:middle line:84%
involves the use of your body,
then being in chronic pain

00:40:54.020 --> 00:40:58.880 align:middle line:84%
in a very real way impacts
your purpose in life.

00:40:58.880 --> 00:41:01.160 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Absolutely
does, because you just

00:41:01.160 --> 00:41:05.130 align:middle line:84%
don't have the juice
to amp up into it.

00:41:05.130 --> 00:41:05.930 align:middle line:90%
You know?

00:41:05.930 --> 00:41:08.700 align:middle line:84%
The pain is always there,
sidetracking everyone

00:41:08.700 --> 00:41:10.140 align:middle line:90%
who is in pain's energy.

00:41:10.140 --> 00:41:12.350 align:middle line:84%
I've only had pain a
couple times in my life

00:41:12.350 --> 00:41:15.200 align:middle line:84%
for a very short
time, and so I only

00:41:15.200 --> 00:41:17.840 align:middle line:84%
have a taste of what
that feeling is like.

00:41:17.840 --> 00:41:20.120 align:middle line:84%
But I've witnessed other
people who have chronic pain,

00:41:20.120 --> 00:41:21.440 align:middle line:90%
and that's a--

00:41:21.440 --> 00:41:21.920 align:middle line:90%
>>ADELSON: It's a curse.

00:41:21.920 --> 00:41:22.880 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: It's a curse.

00:41:22.880 --> 00:41:25.670 align:middle line:84%
And it's wonderful that you're
giving that gift to people,

00:41:25.670 --> 00:41:26.690 align:middle line:90%
giving back on that.

00:41:26.690 --> 00:41:28.040 align:middle line:90%
That's wonderful.

00:41:28.040 --> 00:41:29.537 align:middle line:90%
So let's talk about the future.

00:41:29.537 --> 00:41:31.370 align:middle line:84%
And also, you have a
documentary coming out?

00:41:31.370 --> 00:41:32.690 align:middle line:90%
OK, I want to hear about that.

00:41:32.690 --> 00:41:35.840 align:middle line:84%
The future, where you see
the leading edges going

00:41:35.840 --> 00:41:38.310 align:middle line:90%
right now of stem cell therapy.

00:41:38.310 --> 00:41:40.980 align:middle line:84%
And then also, a little
bit about your documentary

00:41:40.980 --> 00:41:41.780 align:middle line:90%
before we sign off.

00:41:41.780 --> 00:41:42.590 align:middle line:90%
>>ADELSON: Sure.

00:41:42.590 --> 00:41:46.110 align:middle line:84%
So there's two main categories
of stem cell medicine.

00:41:46.110 --> 00:41:48.530 align:middle line:84%
There's what I do, which
is regenerative medicine,

00:41:48.530 --> 00:41:50.660 align:middle line:84%
and then there's
tissue engineering.

00:41:50.660 --> 00:41:53.990 align:middle line:84%
Where all the exciting
research is happening right now

00:41:53.990 --> 00:41:55.680 align:middle line:90%
is in this tissue engineering.

00:41:55.680 --> 00:41:59.930 align:middle line:84%
So what that is is somebody
has a badly torn meniscus,

00:41:59.930 --> 00:42:03.560 align:middle line:84%
and they actually grow a
meniscus in a laboratory

00:42:03.560 --> 00:42:05.540 align:middle line:90%
for surgical implantation.

00:42:05.540 --> 00:42:07.700 align:middle line:84%
Same with kidney,
same with livers,

00:42:07.700 --> 00:42:09.170 align:middle line:90%
same with potentially hearts.

00:42:09.170 --> 00:42:11.310 align:middle line:84%
I mean, you could grow
just about anything.

00:42:11.310 --> 00:42:12.560 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: That's a holy grail.

00:42:12.560 --> 00:42:14.132 align:middle line:84%
>>ADELSON: Within
our lifetime, we

00:42:14.132 --> 00:42:15.590 align:middle line:84%
are going to get
to the point where

00:42:15.590 --> 00:42:20.570 align:middle line:84%
we're going to create
organs and musculoskeletal

00:42:20.570 --> 00:42:23.630 align:middle line:84%
structures in a laboratory
for surgical implantation.

00:42:23.630 --> 00:42:26.750 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: From our
own base materials?

00:42:26.750 --> 00:42:29.100 align:middle line:84%
>>ADELSON: That's yet to be
determined, but probably.

00:42:29.100 --> 00:42:29.900 align:middle line:90%
Probably, though.

00:42:29.900 --> 00:42:30.980 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Interesting.

00:42:30.980 --> 00:42:33.020 align:middle line:84%
So the heart transplant
might look a little

00:42:33.020 --> 00:42:34.230 align:middle line:90%
different in the future.

00:42:34.230 --> 00:42:34.970 align:middle line:90%
>>ADELSON: That's right.

00:42:34.970 --> 00:42:35.480 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Wow.

00:42:35.480 --> 00:42:36.280 align:middle line:90%
That's exciting.

00:42:36.280 --> 00:42:39.140 align:middle line:84%
>>ADELSON: In my area,
in regenerative medicine,

00:42:39.140 --> 00:42:40.710 align:middle line:90%
you know, we're doing great.

00:42:40.710 --> 00:42:42.290 align:middle line:84%
We're very happy
with where we are.

00:42:42.290 --> 00:42:45.830 align:middle line:84%
What needs to happen now
is for the regulation

00:42:45.830 --> 00:42:48.530 align:middle line:84%
to really be solidified,
because there's

00:42:48.530 --> 00:42:51.500 align:middle line:90%
quite a bit that's a gray area.

00:42:51.500 --> 00:42:53.050 align:middle line:90%
And that needs to--

00:42:53.050 --> 00:42:55.724 align:middle line:90%
that all needs to be worked out.

00:42:55.724 --> 00:42:57.050 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: [SIGH] Yeah.

00:42:57.050 --> 00:43:00.320 align:middle line:84%
There's just so much in terms of
oversight that's just not been

00:43:00.320 --> 00:43:01.850 align:middle line:90%
thought through properly yet.

00:43:01.850 --> 00:43:04.520 align:middle line:84%
So hopefully, knock
on wood, we're

00:43:04.520 --> 00:43:07.250 align:middle line:84%
going to have a little bit more
wise guidance in those areas.

00:43:07.250 --> 00:43:09.650 align:middle line:84%
And like you say, have
parameters that work better

00:43:09.650 --> 00:43:12.650 align:middle line:84%
for humanity rather than just
the pharmaceutical companies

00:43:12.650 --> 00:43:17.780 align:middle line:84%
and other high-end procedures
of an allopathic nature.

00:43:17.780 --> 00:43:20.000 align:middle line:84%
They seem to get all the
benefit at this time.

00:43:20.000 --> 00:43:22.550 align:middle line:84%
So I wish you and
people like you

00:43:22.550 --> 00:43:25.550 align:middle line:90%
the best and being able to go--

00:43:25.550 --> 00:43:29.315 align:middle line:84%
just fly as far as you can
with this without causing harm.

00:43:29.315 --> 00:43:30.190 align:middle line:90%
>>ADELSON: Thank you.

00:43:30.190 --> 00:43:31.690 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: That's
the best we can do.

00:43:31.690 --> 00:43:34.415 align:middle line:84%
And your-- "The Stem Cell
Solution," that documentary.

00:43:34.415 --> 00:43:35.215 align:middle line:90%
>>ADELSON: Yeah.

00:43:35.215 --> 00:43:36.675 align:middle line:90%
So I created this.

00:43:36.675 --> 00:43:39.240 align:middle line:84%
It's been out for
almost a year now.

00:43:39.240 --> 00:43:43.020 align:middle line:84%
And I created it because I'm
a naturopathic doctor who

00:43:43.020 --> 00:43:46.200 align:middle line:84%
performs these relatively
invasive procedures.

00:43:46.200 --> 00:43:48.150 align:middle line:84%
Bone marrow aspirations,
disc injections,

00:43:48.150 --> 00:43:49.920 align:middle line:84%
epidural injections,
that sort of thing.

00:43:49.920 --> 00:43:52.830 align:middle line:10%
And it's confusing, and
I'm the first to admit

00:43:52.830 --> 00:43:54.120 align:middle line:10%
that it's kind of weird.

00:43:54.120 --> 00:43:58.110 align:middle line:84%
So I created this film just
to sort of tell my whole story

00:43:58.110 --> 00:44:00.930 align:middle line:84%
and how this whole
thing evolved,

00:44:00.930 --> 00:44:03.840 align:middle line:84%
because it was quite exciting
there in the early years.

00:44:03.840 --> 00:44:06.330 align:middle line:84%
You know, I've traveled through
Central and South America,

00:44:06.330 --> 00:44:09.150 align:middle line:84%
learning from the people who'd
been doing it the longest.

00:44:09.150 --> 00:44:11.700 align:middle line:84%
And it's just been a
wild ride, and I wanted

00:44:11.700 --> 00:44:12.990 align:middle line:90%
to share that with people.

00:44:12.990 --> 00:44:13.830 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Wonderful.

00:44:13.830 --> 00:44:16.680 align:middle line:84%
Well, thank you so much
for all of your efforts,

00:44:16.680 --> 00:44:18.900 align:middle line:84%
passion, due diligence,
and for leaving

00:44:18.900 --> 00:44:21.317 align:middle line:84%
a little trail of information
via your documentary for us.

00:44:21.317 --> 00:44:22.525 align:middle line:90%
>>ADELSON: Thank you so much.

00:44:22.525 --> 00:44:24.440 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Where
can people find it?

00:44:24.440 --> 00:44:26.620 align:middle line:84%
>>ADELSON: My website,

>>REGINA: OK, very good.

00:44:33.480 --> 00:44:34.980 align:middle line:84%
And I'll spell it
again for everyone

00:44:34.980 --> 00:44:37.013 align:middle line:84%
to make sure they had
time to write that down.

00:44:37.013 --> 00:44:39.180 align:middle line:84%
Thank you so much for joining
