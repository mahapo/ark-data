of this grand soul.

00:00:43.170 --> 00:00:45.240 align:middle line:84%
So I said your name
right this time.

00:00:45.240 --> 00:00:45.680 align:middle line:90%
>>MARGUERITE RIGOGLIOSO: Yes.

00:00:45.680 --> 00:00:46.200 align:middle line:90%
Thank you so much.

see you again, Marguerite.

That has just come out,
and it goes more in-depth

00:01:02.920 --> 00:01:06.605 align:middle line:10%
as to what the entity
of Mary herself was.

>>RIGOGLIOSO: There
are how many people

00:01:08.230 --> 00:01:10.450 align:middle line:90%
on the planet, that many Marys.

00:01:10.450 --> 00:01:12.160 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:01:12.160 --> 00:01:13.600 align:middle line:90%
My middle name is Marie.

00:01:13.600 --> 00:01:15.887 align:middle line:84%
My mother's middle name
is Marie, my cousins and--

00:01:15.887 --> 00:01:16.970 align:middle line:90%
>>RIGOGLIOSO: I love that.

00:01:16.970 --> 00:01:18.303 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: --a lot of my friends.

00:01:18.303 --> 00:01:20.170 align:middle line:84%
Isn't that the most
common female name

00:01:20.170 --> 00:01:22.710 align:middle line:84%
on the planet in the
English-speaking or Western

00:01:22.710 --> 00:01:23.510 align:middle line:90%
world?

00:01:23.510 --> 00:01:24.927 align:middle line:84%
>>RIGOGLIOSO: Well,
good question.

00:01:24.927 --> 00:01:27.700 align:middle line:84%
It certainly is very
common, and it certainly

00:01:27.700 --> 00:01:31.400 align:middle line:84%
was one of the major names
at the time when Mary walked.

00:01:31.400 --> 00:01:32.870 align:middle line:90%
It's a priestess title.

00:01:32.870 --> 00:01:34.250 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes, yes.

00:01:34.250 --> 00:01:36.850 align:middle line:84%
That was interesting
because I had a group

00:01:36.850 --> 00:01:39.400 align:middle line:84%
that I was-- a very close
metaphysical group when

00:01:39.400 --> 00:01:42.410 align:middle line:84%
I started really
waking up ages ago.

00:01:42.410 --> 00:01:44.450 align:middle line:90%
And one day, we were talking.

00:01:44.450 --> 00:01:46.910 align:middle line:84%
There were only six of
us-- two men, four women.

00:01:46.910 --> 00:01:50.690 align:middle line:84%
And we found out that with
the exception of one person,

00:01:50.690 --> 00:01:55.930 align:middle line:84%
every woman had the middle name
Marie, and the man of the group

00:01:55.930 --> 00:01:57.370 align:middle line:90%
was Merriman.

00:01:57.370 --> 00:01:58.330 align:middle line:90%
>>RIGOGLIOSO: Wow.

00:01:58.330 --> 00:02:00.038 align:middle line:84%
Well, that's a
synchronicity right there.

00:02:00.038 --> 00:02:01.497 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: There
was something there

00:02:01.497 --> 00:02:03.890 align:middle line:84%
about our energies that
was being drawn together.

00:02:03.890 --> 00:02:05.360 align:middle line:84%
And so go ahead
and explain to us

00:02:05.360 --> 00:02:07.080 align:middle line:84%
what you learned
about the name Mary.

00:02:07.080 --> 00:02:11.295 align:middle line:84%
As you said, this is the name
that indicates a priestess.

00:02:11.295 --> 00:02:12.420 align:middle line:90%
>>RIGOGLIOSO: That's right.

00:02:12.420 --> 00:02:14.710 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: That sound
Maryam, explain it to us.

00:02:14.710 --> 00:02:15.510 align:middle line:90%
>>RIGOGLIOSO: Yeah.

00:02:15.510 --> 00:02:21.150 align:middle line:10%
It goes back to the Hebrew
Miriam or the Aramaic Maryam,

00:02:21.150 --> 00:02:25.520 align:middle line:10%
but it really goes back
to the Egyptian Meri.

00:02:25.520 --> 00:02:26.600 align:middle line:90%
And that--

00:02:26.600 --> 00:02:28.100 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And there
was Mary Tartan.

00:02:28.100 --> 00:02:28.500 align:middle line:90%
>>RIGOGLIOSO: That's right.

00:02:28.500 --> 00:02:30.480 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Meri was
throughout the dynasties.

00:02:30.480 --> 00:02:34.980 align:middle line:10%
>>RIGOGLIOSO: And what it meant
was beloved of the one who loves

00:02:34.980 --> 00:02:36.480 align:middle line:10%
or the one who is love.

00:02:36.480 --> 00:02:41.060 align:middle line:10%
So it was a triple moniker
that was often used to--

00:02:41.060 --> 00:02:46.540 align:middle line:10%
it was given to priestesses
and kings and rulers and things

00:02:46.540 --> 00:02:47.340 align:middle line:10%
like that.

00:02:47.340 --> 00:02:50.030 align:middle line:84%
And so throughout
time, it then got

00:02:50.030 --> 00:02:53.390 align:middle line:84%
translated as this very
high-level title that meant

00:02:53.390 --> 00:02:56.600 align:middle line:90%
the priestess of divine love.

00:02:56.600 --> 00:03:01.330 align:middle line:84%
And that's why we have so many
Marys in the Hebrew tradition

00:03:01.330 --> 00:03:05.470 align:middle line:84%
and also in the
Christian tradition.

00:03:05.470 --> 00:03:07.120 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Around the world.

00:03:07.120 --> 00:03:09.260 align:middle line:90%
So I mentioned a moment ago--

00:03:09.260 --> 00:03:12.170 align:middle line:84%
I said kind of cavalierly
that in the Catholic Church,

00:03:12.170 --> 00:03:15.970 align:middle line:84%
the two Marys were
definitely made diminutive

00:03:15.970 --> 00:03:20.220 align:middle line:84%
in terms of what they offered,
and to this day, I think still

00:03:20.220 --> 00:03:21.020 align:middle line:90%
are.

00:03:21.020 --> 00:03:23.740 align:middle line:84%
So I want to ask you a
question before we really

00:03:23.740 --> 00:03:26.080 align:middle line:90%
even get into the book.

00:03:26.080 --> 00:03:31.580 align:middle line:84%
What do you think would happen
if Mary, the entity of Mary,

00:03:31.580 --> 00:03:32.690 align:middle line:90%
was suddenly known?

00:03:32.690 --> 00:03:35.920 align:middle line:84%
You know how everybody's waiting
for disclosure, for the UFO

00:03:35.920 --> 00:03:38.690 align:middle line:84%
to land on the White House
lawn, all this silly stuff.

00:03:38.690 --> 00:03:42.340 align:middle line:84%
Anyway, what if the entity
Mary finally showed up

00:03:42.340 --> 00:03:44.230 align:middle line:84%
in full form one
day, and everybody

00:03:44.230 --> 00:03:48.560 align:middle line:84%
got to see the incredible
depth of wisdom of this entity?

00:03:48.560 --> 00:03:51.560 align:middle line:84%
How would that affect the
Catholic Church, do you think,

00:03:51.560 --> 00:03:54.770 align:middle line:84%
to have a feminine
presence so powerful?

00:03:54.770 --> 00:03:56.870 align:middle line:90%
In fact, a lot of Christianity.

00:03:56.870 --> 00:03:58.810 align:middle line:90%
What do you think would happen?

00:03:58.810 --> 00:03:59.900 align:middle line:90%
We're playing right now.

00:03:59.900 --> 00:04:00.620 align:middle line:90%
>>RIGOGLIOSO: Yeah, yeah.

00:04:00.620 --> 00:04:01.610 align:middle line:90%
And you know what?

00:04:01.610 --> 00:04:04.850 align:middle line:84%
I think in some way,
that has happened.

00:04:04.850 --> 00:04:07.640 align:middle line:84%
It has happened in
her apparitions.

00:04:07.640 --> 00:04:10.960 align:middle line:84%
It has happened to
smaller and larger groups.

00:04:10.960 --> 00:04:13.550 align:middle line:84%
It's happened for a
lot of individuals.

00:04:13.550 --> 00:04:17.810 align:middle line:84%
So it hasn't been on the White
House lawn kind of thing.

00:04:17.810 --> 00:04:22.520 align:middle line:84%
But in a way, that's better
because she's working.

00:04:22.520 --> 00:04:27.740 align:middle line:84%
She's working like water that's
seeping through the tributaries.

00:04:27.740 --> 00:04:29.660 align:middle line:90%
That's really more her way.

00:04:29.660 --> 00:04:33.410 align:middle line:84%
She's more of a
one-on-one type of person.

00:04:33.410 --> 00:04:35.210 align:middle line:90%
She's available to each of us.

00:04:35.210 --> 00:04:39.800 align:middle line:84%
And I think that her second
coming is arriving now.

00:04:39.800 --> 00:04:44.530 align:middle line:84%
It is happening as more people
are becoming aware of her true

00:04:44.530 --> 00:04:49.120 align:middle line:84%
story and aware of the true
story of Mary Magdalene

00:04:49.120 --> 00:04:52.850 align:middle line:84%
and aware of the true story
of the third famous Mary,

00:04:52.850 --> 00:04:58.960 align:middle line:84%
who is mother Mary's sister,
and possibly also Jesus's--

00:04:58.960 --> 00:05:00.687 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Well, and
Anne too, the mother.

00:05:00.687 --> 00:05:01.520 align:middle line:90%
>>RIGOGLIOSO: Right.

00:05:01.520 --> 00:05:02.630 align:middle line:90%
So she's Anna.

00:05:02.630 --> 00:05:04.720 align:middle line:90%
She's Hannah.

00:05:04.720 --> 00:05:10.010 align:middle line:84%
But there are several Marys
that all carry this energy.

00:05:10.010 --> 00:05:12.770 align:middle line:84%
And they are making themselves
known to people today.

00:05:12.770 --> 00:05:14.680 align:middle line:90%
It's really happening.

00:05:14.680 --> 00:05:18.470 align:middle line:84%
People are having
visions, awakenings.

00:05:18.470 --> 00:05:22.190 align:middle line:84%
They're having experiences
in meditations, in medicine

00:05:22.190 --> 00:05:24.440 align:middle line:90%
ceremonies, the whole works.

00:05:24.440 --> 00:05:27.460 align:middle line:84%
So she's working in
a grassroots, more

00:05:27.460 --> 00:05:29.530 align:middle line:84%
underground way,
and we can talk more

00:05:29.530 --> 00:05:31.495 align:middle line:84%
about what it is that
she is bringing forth.

00:05:31.495 --> 00:05:32.295 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: We will.

00:05:32.295 --> 00:05:35.980 align:middle line:84%
So off-camera, you and I
were talking about Isis

00:05:35.980 --> 00:05:42.700 align:middle line:84%
because you write about the
fact that Mary is a newer

00:05:42.700 --> 00:05:45.200 align:middle line:90%
identity or another identity.

00:05:45.200 --> 00:05:47.650 align:middle line:84%
So let's talk about the
historical roots of Isis

00:05:47.650 --> 00:05:48.830 align:middle line:90%
into Mary.

00:05:48.830 --> 00:05:49.630 align:middle line:90%
>>RIGOGLIOSO: Yeah.

00:05:49.630 --> 00:05:54.460 align:middle line:84%
So Isis being part of the whole
Egyptian pantheon of beings.

00:05:54.460 --> 00:05:56.920 align:middle line:84%
And Rudolf Steiner,
the great seer,

00:05:56.920 --> 00:06:02.910 align:middle line:84%
said that Mother Mary's
previous incarnation was Isis.

00:06:02.910 --> 00:06:05.610 align:middle line:84%
So as that incarnation,
you can see

00:06:05.610 --> 00:06:10.650 align:middle line:84%
that she's perfecting how to do
a resurrection of a male that's

00:06:10.650 --> 00:06:15.340 align:middle line:84%
had his soul and body parts
smashed to smithereens

00:06:15.340 --> 00:06:18.330 align:middle line:84%
and how to do a
divine conception.

00:06:18.330 --> 00:06:20.830 align:middle line:84%
We have both of those
things happening with Isis.

00:06:20.830 --> 00:06:24.010 align:middle line:84%
She resurrects Osiris, and
she gives birth to the Horus.

00:06:24.010 --> 00:06:24.810 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: To Horus.

00:06:24.810 --> 00:06:27.300 align:middle line:84%
>>RIGOGLIOSO: And then when
she makes the crossover

00:06:27.300 --> 00:06:30.400 align:middle line:84%
into her lifetime as Mary,
this is the perfection.

00:06:30.400 --> 00:06:34.390 align:middle line:84%
What I've received is Mary
is the perfection of Isis.

00:06:34.390 --> 00:06:37.960 align:middle line:84%
And so by now, by
all of her lifetime,

00:06:37.960 --> 00:06:45.270 align:middle line:84%
she has really accomplished pure
divine birth and the pure codes

00:06:45.270 --> 00:06:47.890 align:middle line:90%
for resurrecting a male being.

00:06:47.890 --> 00:06:53.040 align:middle line:84%
And then she is serving as a
world healer, as a world guide,

00:06:53.040 --> 00:06:55.660 align:middle line:90%
and as a world spiritual mentor.

00:06:55.660 --> 00:06:57.166 align:middle line:84%
So that's the short
story on that.

00:06:57.166 --> 00:06:57.966 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:06:57.966 --> 00:07:00.720 align:middle line:84%
And when you're speaking,
I'm brought back

00:07:00.720 --> 00:07:04.620 align:middle line:84%
to some of the hermetic
teachings in which Horus

00:07:04.620 --> 00:07:13.290 align:middle line:84%
was the one who incarnated also
as other adepts on the planet,

00:07:13.290 --> 00:07:15.700 align:middle line:90%
including Christ.

00:07:15.700 --> 00:07:16.500 align:middle line:90%
>>RIGOGLIOSO: Yeah.

00:07:16.500 --> 00:07:19.770 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So we're looking
at a tradition that

00:07:19.770 --> 00:07:21.970 align:middle line:90%
far predates Egyptology.

00:07:21.970 --> 00:07:27.480 align:middle line:84%
We're looking at something that
is intrinsic to this dimension

00:07:27.480 --> 00:07:31.300 align:middle line:84%
and beyond of Earth and
perhaps even the cosmos.

00:07:31.300 --> 00:07:35.700 align:middle line:84%
I don't know how far out the
concept of Osiris and Isis

00:07:35.700 --> 00:07:37.390 align:middle line:84%
expand, but I would
think pretty far.

00:07:37.390 --> 00:07:39.700 align:middle line:84%
Because one time, I
was meditating on this.

00:07:39.700 --> 00:07:42.810 align:middle line:84%
And what I was looking
at was that Osiris

00:07:42.810 --> 00:07:49.180 align:middle line:84%
was the logos, the thought,
the word that imprints Isis,

00:07:49.180 --> 00:07:53.710 align:middle line:84%
the prima materia, which
allows it to take form.

00:07:53.710 --> 00:07:56.560 align:middle line:84%
And it can take form through the
logos, the thought, the word.

00:07:56.560 --> 00:07:59.020 align:middle line:84%
Now we know we're creating
our reality that way.

00:07:59.020 --> 00:08:01.450 align:middle line:84%
This is simple stuff to a
lot of people listening,

00:08:01.450 --> 00:08:04.840 align:middle line:84%
but it's profound when you
look at it on a cosmic level.

00:08:04.840 --> 00:08:05.640 align:middle line:90%
>>RIGOGLIOSO: Yeah.

00:08:05.640 --> 00:08:10.620 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So this is the
ultimate in the feminine imprint

00:08:10.620 --> 00:08:13.720 align:middle line:84%
that Isis and then
Mary carried forward.

00:08:13.720 --> 00:08:15.400 align:middle line:90%
>>RIGOGLIOSO: Yeah, absolutely.

00:08:15.400 --> 00:08:19.170 align:middle line:84%
And these constellations,
these clusters of beings

00:08:19.170 --> 00:08:23.200 align:middle line:84%
has been a recurring
pattern throughout time.

00:08:23.200 --> 00:08:27.330 align:middle line:84%
And there's a stream that
is underneath and that

00:08:27.330 --> 00:08:31.980 align:middle line:84%
unites all of them so that they
keep coming at different times

00:08:31.980 --> 00:08:36.750 align:middle line:84%
to help humanity for
different transformations

00:08:36.750 --> 00:08:39.070 align:middle line:84%
and different challenges
that are going on.

00:08:39.070 --> 00:08:44.310 align:middle line:84%
And so we had them
appearing 2,000 years ago,

00:08:44.310 --> 00:08:46.300 align:middle line:90%
but they're also appearing now.

00:08:46.300 --> 00:08:49.370 align:middle line:84%
I mean, they've been continually
micro-appearing throughout those

00:08:49.370 --> 00:08:50.170 align:middle line:90%
2,000 years.

00:08:50.170 --> 00:08:50.970 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:08:50.970 --> 00:08:53.070 align:middle line:84%
We know the big identities
throughout history.

00:08:53.070 --> 00:08:54.420 align:middle line:90%
Those have been chronicled.

00:08:54.420 --> 00:08:57.380 align:middle line:84%
So how do you-- how
do you explain what

00:08:57.380 --> 00:08:59.803 align:middle line:90%
the micro-appearances are like?

00:08:59.803 --> 00:09:01.970 align:middle line:84%
>>RIGOGLIOSO: Well, they've
been those people having

00:09:01.970 --> 00:09:05.480 align:middle line:84%
their one-on-one
experiences, their visions

00:09:05.480 --> 00:09:10.700 align:middle line:84%
of them at different grottoes
and sacred sites of the mystics,

00:09:10.700 --> 00:09:12.800 align:middle line:90%
all of those kinds of things.

00:09:12.800 --> 00:09:16.380 align:middle line:84%
But now there's much more of
a collective thing happening.

00:09:16.380 --> 00:09:20.930 align:middle line:84%
And we see that in the Magdalene
movement of the past 40 years

00:09:20.930 --> 00:09:22.830 align:middle line:90%
where she's been exonerated.

00:09:22.830 --> 00:09:24.450 align:middle line:90%
The veil has been lifted on her.

00:09:24.450 --> 00:09:27.630 align:middle line:84%
We're understanding her on
deeper levels of the feminine.

00:09:27.630 --> 00:09:30.270 align:middle line:84%
And now it's the
unveiling of Mother Mary.

00:09:30.270 --> 00:09:33.710 align:middle line:84%
And this is part of
the second coming,

00:09:33.710 --> 00:09:36.120 align:middle line:90%
but it's not just about them.

00:09:36.120 --> 00:09:39.290 align:middle line:84%
It's about each of us
because what I've received

00:09:39.290 --> 00:09:43.530 align:middle line:84%
is that they are just mirrors
of what's in our own soul,

00:09:43.530 --> 00:09:47.870 align:middle line:84%
and they're helping to turn
our inner lights on so that we

00:09:47.870 --> 00:09:52.510 align:middle line:84%
collectively become that second
coming where we are opening

00:09:52.510 --> 00:09:56.480 align:middle line:84%
our consciousness, we are
connecting with the divine,

00:09:56.480 --> 00:09:58.460 align:middle line:84%
we are doing this
personal healing,

00:09:58.460 --> 00:10:01.570 align:middle line:84%
and we are going
forward on the planet

00:10:01.570 --> 00:10:04.450 align:middle line:84%
to bring this global
healing that's needed.

00:10:04.450 --> 00:10:05.620 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:10:05.620 --> 00:10:07.990 align:middle line:84%
And from everything
I'm understanding

00:10:07.990 --> 00:10:12.880 align:middle line:84%
about the prevailing
energies, frequencies

00:10:12.880 --> 00:10:17.950 align:middle line:84%
that have moved into our cosmos
and are motivating everything

00:10:17.950 --> 00:10:22.510 align:middle line:84%
throughout the cosmos, including
human activity in creativity

00:10:22.510 --> 00:10:24.370 align:middle line:84%
and everything going
on, the one thing

00:10:24.370 --> 00:10:28.240 align:middle line:84%
that those energies are
demanding is for the feminine

00:10:28.240 --> 00:10:32.840 align:middle line:84%
to come forward, take its
place in all positions in life,

00:10:32.840 --> 00:10:36.100 align:middle line:84%
just take its rightful place
alongside the masculine, not

00:10:36.100 --> 00:10:38.690 align:middle line:84%
to wipe out or
dominate the masculine

00:10:38.690 --> 00:10:42.310 align:middle line:84%
but to take its full place
on the planet, and not

00:10:42.310 --> 00:10:44.390 align:middle line:84%
just this planet but
throughout the cosmos.

00:10:44.390 --> 00:10:46.390 align:middle line:84%
So it's really
interesting as we watch

00:10:46.390 --> 00:10:48.040 align:middle line:90%
what's going on historically.

00:10:48.040 --> 00:10:51.060 align:middle line:84%
Any time we move from
one phase to another,

00:10:51.060 --> 00:10:54.660 align:middle line:84%
every entity will fight
to keep its old way going.

00:10:54.660 --> 00:10:56.450 align:middle line:84%
So we have a massive
fight going on

00:10:56.450 --> 00:11:00.090 align:middle line:84%
to keep patriarchy going
through every system.

00:11:00.090 --> 00:11:02.420 align:middle line:84%
And so now you
can't fight the fact

00:11:02.420 --> 00:11:07.070 align:middle line:84%
that the feminine has to
emerge into our consciousness

00:11:07.070 --> 00:11:11.400 align:middle line:84%
as a way of being, which is
what's sharing, collaboration,

00:11:11.400 --> 00:11:14.955 align:middle line:84%
cooperation, the opposite of
competition, and so forth.

00:11:14.955 --> 00:11:16.080 align:middle line:90%
>>RIGOGLIOSO: That's right.

00:11:16.080 --> 00:11:20.300 align:middle line:84%
And I think, Regina, what's been
happening on the planet is just

00:11:20.300 --> 00:11:24.270 align:middle line:84%
a reflection of this
interdimensional activity,

00:11:24.270 --> 00:11:26.530 align:middle line:84%
this interdimensional
warfare that's--

00:11:26.530 --> 00:11:27.330 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: I agree.

00:11:27.330 --> 00:11:31.890 align:middle line:84%
>>RIGOGLIOSO: --taking over
by yang energies of the yin.

00:11:31.890 --> 00:11:34.490 align:middle line:84%
And yes, there is
a big rebirthing

00:11:34.490 --> 00:11:37.280 align:middle line:84%
of the feminine that is
absolutely needed now.

00:11:37.280 --> 00:11:38.640 align:middle line:90%
That is happening.

00:11:38.640 --> 00:11:40.380 align:middle line:90%
That will continue to happen.

00:11:40.380 --> 00:11:43.100 align:middle line:84%
And that is part of the
emergence of the Marys

00:11:43.100 --> 00:11:44.100 align:middle line:90%
on the planet right now.

00:11:44.100 --> 00:11:46.580 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And so would
you say that Mary

00:11:46.580 --> 00:11:50.470 align:middle line:84%
is the main-- as the archetypal
feminine throughout the cosmos,

00:11:50.470 --> 00:11:55.910 align:middle line:84%
is the main entity that
is really available to us?

00:11:55.910 --> 00:11:57.170 align:middle line:90%
I mean, we all have guides.

00:11:57.170 --> 00:11:58.400 align:middle line:90%
We have our higher selves.

00:11:58.400 --> 00:12:00.650 align:middle line:84%
We have feminine
guides and all that.

00:12:00.650 --> 00:12:03.160 align:middle line:84%
Would you put her in
a position that she's

00:12:03.160 --> 00:12:05.450 align:middle line:84%
one entity that
anyone can call on?

00:12:05.450 --> 00:12:07.930 align:middle line:84%
Because as such a
vast entity, I think

00:12:07.930 --> 00:12:11.990 align:middle line:84%
you say she can fractalize and
be there for you at your level.

00:12:11.990 --> 00:12:12.790 align:middle line:90%
>>RIGOGLIOSO: Yeah.

00:12:12.790 --> 00:12:13.790 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

00:12:13.790 --> 00:12:18.010 align:middle line:84%
She achieved full
human ascension

00:12:18.010 --> 00:12:23.390 align:middle line:84%
in her lifetime, which is what a
lot of us are seeking right now.

00:12:23.390 --> 00:12:24.470 align:middle line:90%
What is ascension?

00:12:24.470 --> 00:12:27.010 align:middle line:84%
Well, it's becoming
one with the divine.

00:12:27.010 --> 00:12:32.230 align:middle line:84%
At her final passing,
she completely unified

00:12:32.230 --> 00:12:35.420 align:middle line:84%
with the umbrella of Mother
Divine, we might call her.

00:12:35.420 --> 00:12:40.420 align:middle line:84%
And so now she is available
in that fractalized format.

00:12:40.420 --> 00:12:44.320 align:middle line:84%
She still retains her
personality structure

00:12:44.320 --> 00:12:48.090 align:middle line:84%
of Mother Mary for those who
want to call on her as that.

00:12:48.090 --> 00:12:49.920 align:middle line:90%
And anyone can call on her.

00:12:49.920 --> 00:12:52.828 align:middle line:84%
It doesn't matter
what tradition.

00:12:52.828 --> 00:12:54.120 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: You can call on Isis.

00:12:54.120 --> 00:12:54.870 align:middle line:90%
That's OK too.

00:12:54.870 --> 00:12:56.703 align:middle line:84%
>>RIGOGLIOSO: That's
right because she's not

00:12:56.703 --> 00:13:01.070 align:middle line:84%
the only appearance or facet
of the divine feminine crystal

00:13:01.070 --> 00:13:01.890 align:middle line:90%
that's available.

00:13:01.890 --> 00:13:04.730 align:middle line:84%
So I like to say
this is not about,

00:13:04.730 --> 00:13:08.303 align:middle line:84%
let's say, the re-christianizing
of the world per se.

00:13:08.303 --> 00:13:09.720 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: It's not
about identity.

00:13:09.720 --> 00:13:11.120 align:middle line:90%
>>RIGOGLIOSO: Yeah.

00:13:11.120 --> 00:13:13.400 align:middle line:90%
It's about-- she's available.

00:13:13.400 --> 00:13:15.930 align:middle line:90%
She does speak to many people.

00:13:15.930 --> 00:13:18.920 align:middle line:84%
And so she's a
resource for those

00:13:18.920 --> 00:13:21.862 align:middle line:84%
who do want to open up
and connect with her.

00:13:21.862 --> 00:13:23.070 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Thank you for that.

00:13:23.070 --> 00:13:25.400 align:middle line:84%
Now let's get personal
because you actually

00:13:25.400 --> 00:13:26.940 align:middle line:90%
had an experience yourself.

00:13:26.940 --> 00:13:27.930 align:middle line:90%
You'd been studying.

00:13:27.930 --> 00:13:29.270 align:middle line:90%
I mean, you're a scholar.

00:13:29.270 --> 00:13:32.220 align:middle line:84%
You'd been studying all
of this for decades.

00:13:32.220 --> 00:13:35.570 align:middle line:84%
And then in 2018, you
had your own experience

00:13:35.570 --> 00:13:37.880 align:middle line:84%
because there was an
aspect of your feminine

00:13:37.880 --> 00:13:41.610 align:middle line:84%
that had somehow been diminished
or crushed along the way,

00:13:41.610 --> 00:13:44.610 align:middle line:84%
and there was a great deal of
grief and sadness around it.

00:13:44.610 --> 00:13:47.090 align:middle line:84%
So tell us your personal
story and what happened.

00:13:47.090 --> 00:13:47.890 align:middle line:90%
>>RIGOGLIOSO: Yeah.

00:13:47.890 --> 00:13:51.490 align:middle line:84%
So my mother, who was
named Marie Dolores,

00:13:51.490 --> 00:13:56.480 align:middle line:84%
Mary of the Sorrows, crossed
over when I was 10 years old.

00:13:56.480 --> 00:13:57.650 align:middle line:90%
She had lupus.

00:13:57.650 --> 00:14:01.220 align:middle line:90%
And so she left my life.

00:14:01.220 --> 00:14:04.210 align:middle line:84%
And it really felt like on every
level, and that led to a lot

00:14:04.210 --> 00:14:04.300 align:middle line:90%
of--

00:14:04.300 --> 00:14:05.717 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Were you
close with her?

00:14:05.717 --> 00:14:06.755 align:middle line:90%
>>RIGOGLIOSO: Yes.

00:14:06.755 --> 00:14:09.190 align:middle line:84%
And it led to a lot
of chaos in my family

00:14:09.190 --> 00:14:15.250 align:middle line:84%
and a lot of real trauma, almost
even destruction for my family

00:14:15.250 --> 00:14:16.900 align:middle line:90%
structure and so forth.

00:14:16.900 --> 00:14:20.530 align:middle line:84%
So that was-- I think I came
in with a mission of helping

00:14:20.530 --> 00:14:22.540 align:middle line:84%
humanity, and that
was just something

00:14:22.540 --> 00:14:26.660 align:middle line:84%
that was continually beating
me down every step of the way.

00:14:26.660 --> 00:14:30.290 align:middle line:84%
And I had to really have a
warrior spirit to fight that.

00:14:30.290 --> 00:14:33.610 align:middle line:84%
So I started getting
into my explorations

00:14:33.610 --> 00:14:36.670 align:middle line:84%
of the sacred feminine
on intellectual as well

00:14:36.670 --> 00:14:40.940 align:middle line:84%
as scholastic
levels, experiential.

00:14:40.940 --> 00:14:44.400 align:middle line:84%
And I introduced myself
to different pantheons

00:14:44.400 --> 00:14:45.720 align:middle line:90%
of the Marys and then--

00:14:45.720 --> 00:14:47.700 align:middle line:84%
of the goddess
and then found out

00:14:47.700 --> 00:14:50.620 align:middle line:84%
that Mary was the goddess
of my own backyard.

00:14:50.620 --> 00:14:57.210 align:middle line:84%
And so eventually, as I
deepened into my research

00:14:57.210 --> 00:15:00.870 align:middle line:84%
with Mother Mary,
I started deepening

00:15:00.870 --> 00:15:05.590 align:middle line:84%
into my experience with her
as a healer, as a mentor,

00:15:05.590 --> 00:15:06.670 align:middle line:90%
and so forth.

00:15:06.670 --> 00:15:11.950 align:middle line:84%
And that's been really a lot
over the past 10 years per se.

00:15:11.950 --> 00:15:14.230 align:middle line:84%
And there have been
roadmarks along the way,

00:15:14.230 --> 00:15:16.940 align:middle line:84%
and we talked about how she
was a real estate agent for me

00:15:16.940 --> 00:15:17.260 align:middle line:90%
previously.

00:15:17.260 --> 00:15:19.140 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Yeah, we talked
about that in our last show.

00:15:19.140 --> 00:15:19.870 align:middle line:90%
>>RIGOGLIOSO: In the last show.

00:15:19.870 --> 00:15:20.680 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: People can
take a look at that.

00:15:20.680 --> 00:15:21.480 align:middle line:90%
>>RIGOGLIOSO: Yeah.

00:15:21.480 --> 00:15:26.740 align:middle line:84%
Well, most recently, I had an
experience through William Henry

00:15:26.740 --> 00:15:30.690 align:middle line:84%
actually, our friend, who
is very, very connected

00:15:30.690 --> 00:15:31.805 align:middle line:90%
with the Mary energies.

00:15:31.805 --> 00:15:33.962 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes, he is.

00:15:33.962 --> 00:15:37.210 align:middle line:84%
>>RIGOGLIOSO: Really
bringing in that energy now.

00:15:37.210 --> 00:15:42.150 align:middle line:84%
And he introduced me to
his partner, Julie Belfer.

00:15:42.150 --> 00:15:46.040 align:middle line:84%
And I started getting to know
them over the past few months.

00:15:46.040 --> 00:15:49.870 align:middle line:84%
And they were talking
to me, and she

00:15:49.870 --> 00:15:55.430 align:middle line:84%
invited me to have a ceremony
with her with a sacred medicine.

00:15:55.430 --> 00:16:00.130 align:middle line:84%
And I thought about it, and
eventually, I decided to do it.

00:16:00.130 --> 00:16:04.460 align:middle line:84%
So I went, I had this
experience with her,

00:16:04.460 --> 00:16:06.580 align:middle line:84%
and I trusted that she
was the perfect person

00:16:06.580 --> 00:16:09.460 align:middle line:84%
to do this because she
is a psychopomp, meaning

00:16:09.460 --> 00:16:14.710 align:middle line:84%
she knows how to take people
to their dead and back.

00:16:14.710 --> 00:16:17.470 align:middle line:90%
I had never in all of my years--

00:16:17.470 --> 00:16:19.900 align:middle line:84%
and it's been quite
a number of decades

00:16:19.900 --> 00:16:22.840 align:middle line:90%
since my mother crossed over--

00:16:22.840 --> 00:16:27.620 align:middle line:84%
made a concerted effort to
meet her on the other side.

00:16:27.620 --> 00:16:29.500 align:middle line:84%
So this was going
to happen, and I

00:16:29.500 --> 00:16:31.780 align:middle line:84%
was going to call in the
energies of Mother Mary

00:16:31.780 --> 00:16:33.010 align:middle line:90%
to assist.

00:16:33.010 --> 00:16:36.680 align:middle line:90%
Well, went into the ceremony.

00:16:36.680 --> 00:16:39.830 align:middle line:84%
And as I was starting to
cross through the threshold,

00:16:39.830 --> 00:16:42.090 align:middle line:90%
it became a little scary.

00:16:42.090 --> 00:16:45.240 align:middle line:84%
And I had to hold Julie's
hand, and she just

00:16:45.240 --> 00:16:46.920 align:middle line:90%
helped me breathe through it.

00:16:46.920 --> 00:16:52.170 align:middle line:84%
And then there was Mother Mary,
and then there was my mother.

00:16:52.170 --> 00:16:55.770 align:middle line:84%
And a tremendous healing
took place for me

00:16:55.770 --> 00:17:00.660 align:middle line:84%
because what I experienced
was unity with the mother

00:17:00.660 --> 00:17:03.180 align:middle line:90%
through Mother Mary.

00:17:03.180 --> 00:17:08.160 align:middle line:84%
And I was shown on a personal
level the bigger picture

00:17:08.160 --> 00:17:11.740 align:middle line:84%
that my mother had been part
of the Sophia Christos mission.

00:17:11.740 --> 00:17:13.837 align:middle line:84%
That is why she was
named Marie Dolores.

00:17:13.837 --> 00:17:15.670 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: I was going
to ask you about that.

00:17:15.670 --> 00:17:17.589 align:middle line:84%
Can you just expand
on that a bit?

00:17:17.589 --> 00:17:18.643 align:middle line:90%
Dolores-- sadness.

00:17:18.643 --> 00:17:19.560 align:middle line:90%
>>RIGOGLIOSO: Sadness.

00:17:19.560 --> 00:17:20.735 align:middle line:90%
Mary of the Sorrows.

00:17:20.735 --> 00:17:23.050 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Why did she
choose the sorrows?

00:17:23.050 --> 00:17:24.940 align:middle line:84%
>>RIGOGLIOSO: Her
mother, my grandmother,

00:17:24.940 --> 00:17:29.085 align:middle line:84%
unconsciously because Dolores
was a name that was being used.

00:17:29.085 --> 00:17:30.460 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So she
wasn't thinking.

00:17:30.460 --> 00:17:31.720 align:middle line:90%
She was just a popular name.

00:17:31.720 --> 00:17:32.040 align:middle line:84%
>>RIGOGLIOSO: It was
not a popular name.

00:17:32.040 --> 00:17:33.850 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Not knowing what she
was bringing her daughter with.

00:17:33.850 --> 00:17:34.690 align:middle line:84%
>>RIGOGLIOSO:
Yeah, that's right.

00:17:34.690 --> 00:17:35.430 align:middle line:90%
That's right.

00:17:35.430 --> 00:17:37.150 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And we do this
with our kids all the time,

00:17:37.150 --> 00:17:37.690 align:middle line:90%
by the way.

00:17:37.690 --> 00:17:38.320 align:middle line:90%
>>RIGOGLIOSO: That's right.

00:17:38.320 --> 00:17:40.270 align:middle line:84%
All naming is
generally unconscious.

00:17:40.270 --> 00:17:41.170 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:17:41.170 --> 00:17:43.140 align:middle line:84%
>>RIGOGLIOSO: But we are
part of the larger picture,

00:17:43.140 --> 00:17:44.790 align:middle line:84%
and we don't even realize
it through the naming

00:17:44.790 --> 00:17:45.675 align:middle line:90%
of our children.

00:17:45.675 --> 00:17:47.050 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So
continue your story.

00:17:47.050 --> 00:17:48.130 align:middle line:90%
I just had to ask that one.

00:17:48.130 --> 00:17:48.420 align:middle line:90%
>>RIGOGLIOSO: Yeah.

00:17:48.420 --> 00:17:49.740 align:middle line:90%
So there was my mother.

00:17:49.740 --> 00:17:53.710 align:middle line:84%
And I really had the experience
of her that the two of us

00:17:53.710 --> 00:17:56.770 align:middle line:84%
were still enmeshed because I
was still worried about her.

00:17:56.770 --> 00:17:58.350 align:middle line:90%
Was she healed?

00:17:58.350 --> 00:17:59.880 align:middle line:90%
Did she cross well?

00:17:59.880 --> 00:18:00.880 align:middle line:90%
Didn't she?

00:18:00.880 --> 00:18:04.030 align:middle line:84%
And so what I experienced
was an unmeshing

00:18:04.030 --> 00:18:07.260 align:middle line:84%
because I could trust that
she was being taken now

00:18:07.260 --> 00:18:10.770 align:middle line:84%
into the arms of
these great beings.

00:18:10.770 --> 00:18:14.850 align:middle line:90%
So that was dramatic enough.

00:18:14.850 --> 00:18:16.860 align:middle line:90%
And it was--

00:18:16.860 --> 00:18:18.660 align:middle line:84%
I knew when it was
happening that it

00:18:18.660 --> 00:18:21.480 align:middle line:84%
was absolutely life-changing,
that I was forever

00:18:21.480 --> 00:18:23.470 align:middle line:90%
changed and healed.

00:18:23.470 --> 00:18:26.320 align:middle line:84%
And so in the months
since then, I thought,

00:18:26.320 --> 00:18:28.750 align:middle line:84%
oh, well, it'll just
kind of wear down.

00:18:28.750 --> 00:18:29.860 align:middle line:90%
But it hasn't.

00:18:29.860 --> 00:18:31.900 align:middle line:90%
It's actually only increased.

00:18:31.900 --> 00:18:33.190 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: You released that.

00:18:33.190 --> 00:18:33.990 align:middle line:90%
>>RIGOGLIOSO: Yeah.

00:18:33.990 --> 00:18:35.490 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Really released it.

00:18:35.490 --> 00:18:39.432 align:middle line:84%
Didn't you also encounter
her after a surgery?

00:18:39.432 --> 00:18:41.140 align:middle line:84%
>>RIGOGLIOSO: I
encountered Mother Mary--

00:18:41.140 --> 00:18:41.730 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Mother Mary in 2018.

00:18:41.730 --> 00:18:43.272 align:middle line:84%
>>RIGOGLIOSO: --after
a surgery, yes.

00:18:43.272 --> 00:18:48.960 align:middle line:84%
So she showed up there as this
big figure, this big healing

00:18:48.960 --> 00:18:52.410 align:middle line:84%
figure, with my grandparents,
all four of my grandparents

00:18:52.410 --> 00:18:54.060 align:middle line:90%
in the recovery room.

00:18:54.060 --> 00:18:57.450 align:middle line:84%
So yes, I had seen and
felt her before, never

00:18:57.450 --> 00:19:00.690 align:middle line:84%
in connection with my
mother and with specifically

00:19:00.690 --> 00:19:04.900 align:middle line:84%
this great dramatic
healing that I needed.

00:19:04.900 --> 00:19:09.300 align:middle line:84%
And so since then, my
PTSD has been released,

00:19:09.300 --> 00:19:11.970 align:middle line:84%
and the chronic anxiety
that I've experienced

00:19:11.970 --> 00:19:15.850 align:middle line:84%
has been released, and the
grief has been released.

00:19:15.850 --> 00:19:20.800 align:middle line:84%
So I keep checking in with
myself and saying, wow,

00:19:20.800 --> 00:19:24.850 align:middle line:84%
I am just not governed
by this sadness anymore.

00:19:24.850 --> 00:19:31.600 align:middle line:84%
And with that sadness gone, I
am less angry, I'm less worried,

00:19:31.600 --> 00:19:36.150 align:middle line:84%
and I can do my work of
helping bring the Marys forth

00:19:36.150 --> 00:19:40.400 align:middle line:84%
to other people in a whole
different much more calm

00:19:40.400 --> 00:19:41.580 align:middle line:90%
and loving way.

00:19:41.580 --> 00:19:46.590 align:middle line:84%
So this was the karmic healing
that my soul had needed.

00:19:46.590 --> 00:19:52.820 align:middle line:84%
And I feel like it was also
kind of an orchestrated reward

00:19:52.820 --> 00:19:54.780 align:middle line:90%
in a way that will happen.

00:19:54.780 --> 00:19:59.000 align:middle line:84%
If you do this work
in earnest and if you

00:19:59.000 --> 00:20:02.280 align:middle line:84%
keep trying to do your
deep-level healing,

00:20:02.280 --> 00:20:05.130 align:middle line:84%
you keep calling on
these beings to help you,

00:20:05.130 --> 00:20:07.850 align:middle line:84%
it will bring forth
what it is that you

00:20:07.850 --> 00:20:13.310 align:middle line:84%
need to move past all of the
trauma and all of the difficulty

00:20:13.310 --> 00:20:15.593 align:middle line:84%
that we have on Planet
Earth that can keep us back.

00:20:15.593 --> 00:20:17.010 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Yeah,
there's the grace.

00:20:17.010 --> 00:20:18.180 align:middle line:90%
The help is always there.

00:20:18.180 --> 00:20:21.598 align:middle line:84%
And I have to say, seeing
you this time after last time

00:20:21.598 --> 00:20:23.640 align:middle line:84%
when I first saw you walked
into the makeup room,

00:20:23.640 --> 00:20:26.670 align:middle line:84%
I thought, oh gosh, your face
looks so relaxed and beautiful.

00:20:26.670 --> 00:20:27.870 align:middle line:90%
You look more relaxed.

00:20:27.870 --> 00:20:30.930 align:middle line:84%
Your face, your expression,
everything is more relaxed now.

00:20:30.930 --> 00:20:32.440 align:middle line:90%
So that's the secret--

00:20:32.440 --> 00:20:33.240 align:middle line:90%
healing.

00:20:33.240 --> 00:20:34.323 align:middle line:90%
>>RIGOGLIOSO: Yeah, it is.

00:20:34.323 --> 00:20:37.063 align:middle line:84%
My clairvoyant guide said,
when Regina sees you,

00:20:37.063 --> 00:20:39.230 align:middle line:84%
she's going to notice the
difference in your energy.

00:20:39.230 --> 00:20:40.240 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah, I did.

00:20:40.240 --> 00:20:41.770 align:middle line:90%
It's very clear.

00:20:41.770 --> 00:20:43.700 align:middle line:90%
Much more calm, smooth.

00:20:43.700 --> 00:20:45.730 align:middle line:84%
Your face is smooth and
calm, but your energy's

00:20:45.730 --> 00:20:46.610 align:middle line:90%
smooth and calm.

00:20:46.610 --> 00:20:47.410 align:middle line:90%
>>RIGOGLIOSO: Yeah.

00:20:47.410 --> 00:20:48.640 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: So congratulations.

00:20:48.640 --> 00:20:49.400 align:middle line:90%
>>RIGOGLIOSO: Thank you.

00:20:49.400 --> 00:20:50.770 align:middle line:90%
And thank you, William Henry.

00:20:50.770 --> 00:20:52.100 align:middle line:90%
Thank you, Julie Belfer.

00:20:52.100 --> 00:20:53.150 align:middle line:90%
Thank you, Mother Mary.

00:20:53.150 --> 00:20:56.030 align:middle line:84%
And the gratitude
is so tremendous.

00:20:56.030 --> 00:20:56.830 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:20:56.830 --> 00:20:58.990 align:middle line:84%
Well, now let's get
on to Mother Mary

00:20:58.990 --> 00:21:02.750 align:middle line:84%
a bit more because I didn't
know this about her before,

00:21:02.750 --> 00:21:07.250 align:middle line:84%
but the Indian saint Sri
Kaleshwar considered--

00:21:07.250 --> 00:21:10.070 align:middle line:84%
first of all, as
an Indian saint,

00:21:10.070 --> 00:21:12.070 align:middle line:90%
he had the abilities of sight.

00:21:12.070 --> 00:21:16.130 align:middle line:84%
So he could go back in time, and
he could see his own past lives.

00:21:16.130 --> 00:21:22.720 align:middle line:84%
And he actually was connecting
and around and able to watch,

00:21:22.720 --> 00:21:27.200 align:middle line:84%
at the time, Jesus
and Mary Magdalene.

00:21:27.200 --> 00:21:34.780 align:middle line:84%
And I want you to tell us how he
framed his observation of what

00:21:34.780 --> 00:21:36.870 align:middle line:90%
Mother Mary was as a soul.

00:21:36.870 --> 00:21:38.640 align:middle line:84%
>>RIGOGLIOSO: Yeah,
this is so important.

00:21:38.640 --> 00:21:39.608 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:21:39.608 --> 00:21:41.150 align:middle line:84%
>>RIGOGLIOSO: This
was revealed to me

00:21:41.150 --> 00:21:43.670 align:middle line:84%
in these teachings about
the holy womb chakra

00:21:43.670 --> 00:21:45.510 align:middle line:90%
system back in 2017.

00:21:45.510 --> 00:21:47.780 align:middle line:84%
My teacher, Cindy
Lindsay, conveyed them.

00:21:47.780 --> 00:21:50.720 align:middle line:84%
And Sri Kaleshwar
had past life memory

00:21:50.720 --> 00:21:55.280 align:middle line:84%
of walking with the Holy
Family when they were there.

00:21:55.280 --> 00:21:58.650 align:middle line:84%
He himself only lived
until he was 39.

00:21:58.650 --> 00:22:01.170 align:middle line:84%
He crossed over and
had his mahasamadhi,

00:22:01.170 --> 00:22:03.330 align:middle line:90%
as they say, in 2012.

00:22:03.330 --> 00:22:08.310 align:middle line:84%
But he had gathered so
much information about her,

00:22:08.310 --> 00:22:10.170 align:middle line:84%
not only from his
personal recall

00:22:10.170 --> 00:22:14.930 align:middle line:84%
but from the palm leaf
manuscripts, the ancient palms

00:22:14.930 --> 00:22:16.760 align:middle line:84%
that had been
pounded into paper,

00:22:16.760 --> 00:22:19.040 align:middle line:84%
and that revealed
mantras and yantras

00:22:19.040 --> 00:22:21.030 align:middle line:90%
and philosophical understanding.

00:22:21.030 --> 00:22:24.900 align:middle line:84%
So this was part of his research
for understanding Mother Mary.

00:22:24.900 --> 00:22:28.880 align:middle line:84%
And what he said was she was the
greatest person, the greatest

00:22:28.880 --> 00:22:33.930 align:middle line:84%
master who ever walked the
planet, including Jesus,

00:22:33.930 --> 00:22:36.430 align:middle line:84%
including greater than Jesus
because she was the one who

00:22:36.430 --> 00:22:38.890 align:middle line:90%
brought him in and taught him.

00:22:38.890 --> 00:22:44.840 align:middle line:10%
And he says that she,
like so many of us,

00:22:44.840 --> 00:22:48.730 align:middle line:10%
was praying and meditating and
seeing the state of the world

00:22:48.730 --> 00:22:52.490 align:middle line:10%
2,000-plus years ago
and said, Mother Divine,

00:22:52.490 --> 00:22:55.640 align:middle line:10%
what can I do to
help this realm?

00:22:55.640 --> 00:22:59.060 align:middle line:84%
And according to Kaleshwar,
she was told that, well,

00:22:59.060 --> 00:23:05.000 align:middle line:84%
you cannot come in like a
Kali warrior at this time.

00:23:05.000 --> 00:23:06.050 align:middle line:90%
You are nature.

00:23:06.050 --> 00:23:07.250 align:middle line:90%
You are the world.

00:23:07.250 --> 00:23:09.430 align:middle line:84%
So you are going to have
to bring forth something

00:23:09.430 --> 00:23:12.200 align:middle line:84%
from yourself to be
that warrior energy.

00:23:12.200 --> 00:23:14.930 align:middle line:84%
It's going to have to
be a Shiva-like energy.

00:23:14.930 --> 00:23:19.390 align:middle line:84%
And so she brought forth Jesus
through all of her processes

00:23:19.390 --> 00:23:22.300 align:middle line:84%
and tools that she
knew, the conception

00:23:22.300 --> 00:23:26.360 align:middle line:84%
practices that she had perfected
in all of her lifetimes.

00:23:26.360 --> 00:23:30.140 align:middle line:84%
And she brought
forth this new soul.

00:23:30.140 --> 00:23:35.140 align:middle line:84%
And while he was
gestating in her womb,

00:23:35.140 --> 00:23:39.570 align:middle line:84%
she was teaching him because she
had this strenuous meditation

00:23:39.570 --> 00:23:44.310 align:middle line:84%
practice and timing by which she
would be talking to the angels

00:23:44.310 --> 00:23:46.300 align:middle line:84%
and doing her mantras
and things like that.

00:23:46.300 --> 00:23:48.000 align:middle line:84%
She would be pulling
on this energy

00:23:48.000 --> 00:23:49.930 align:middle line:90%
to teach Jesus in the womb.

00:23:49.930 --> 00:23:52.840 align:middle line:84%
It was used during
the birth of Jesus.

00:23:52.840 --> 00:23:54.970 align:middle line:90%
It was used during his lifetime.

00:23:54.970 --> 00:23:59.020 align:middle line:84%
And Kaleshwar said that whenever
Jesus would do any healings,

00:23:59.020 --> 00:24:02.730 align:middle line:84%
he would always call upon his
mother's energy first in order

00:24:02.730 --> 00:24:05.890 align:middle line:84%
to empower him to do that,
that they were soulmates.

00:24:05.890 --> 00:24:09.040 align:middle line:84%
And this is verified in
the Gospel of Philip,

00:24:09.040 --> 00:24:11.145 align:middle line:90%
where she was always with Jesus.

00:24:11.145 --> 00:24:15.450 align:middle line:84%
She, Mary Magdalene, and Mother
Mary's sister, the third Mary,

00:24:15.450 --> 00:24:16.990 align:middle line:90%
were always with him.

00:24:16.990 --> 00:24:22.440 align:middle line:84%
And so by the time it came
for the crucifixion, when

00:24:22.440 --> 00:24:27.090 align:middle line:84%
he was on the cross, he
was practicing Atma Kandana

00:24:27.090 --> 00:24:29.820 align:middle line:84%
yoga, which was a
process of being

00:24:29.820 --> 00:24:32.680 align:middle line:84%
able to pull most of
his soul out of the body

00:24:32.680 --> 00:24:35.390 align:middle line:84%
except for a little
piece, leave it in.

00:24:35.390 --> 00:24:42.860 align:middle line:84%
And then when he expired,
Mother Mary had him taken down.

00:24:42.860 --> 00:24:47.090 align:middle line:84%
And then she put him on
her lap like the Pieta.

00:24:47.090 --> 00:24:50.810 align:middle line:84%
So that was an incredible
channeled statue.

00:24:50.810 --> 00:24:57.070 align:middle line:84%
And she did these processes to
resurrect the pieces of his soul

00:24:57.070 --> 00:24:58.790 align:middle line:90%
that had been scattered.

00:24:58.790 --> 00:25:03.610 align:middle line:84%
And Kaleshwar said it was
like a lightning wave that

00:25:03.610 --> 00:25:06.342 align:middle line:84%
came back through
to shock him back,

00:25:06.342 --> 00:25:08.115 align:middle line:90%
and she brought him to life.

00:25:08.115 --> 00:25:11.285 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And wasn't there some
history written about that also?

00:25:11.285 --> 00:25:12.160 align:middle line:90%
I have it down here--

00:25:12.160 --> 00:25:14.360 align:middle line:84%
Maximus's paper, The
Life of the Virgin.

00:25:14.360 --> 00:25:15.160 align:middle line:90%
>>RIGOGLIOSO: Yeah.

00:25:15.160 --> 00:25:18.850 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Talk about from
that perspective what he saw

00:25:18.850 --> 00:25:20.660 align:middle line:90%
with Mother Mary at that time.

00:25:20.660 --> 00:25:23.260 align:middle line:84%
>>RIGOGLIOSO: So in
The Life of the Virgin,

00:25:23.260 --> 00:25:25.700 align:middle line:84%
that biography that
is attributed to him,

00:25:25.700 --> 00:25:31.020 align:middle line:84%
Maximus, he verifies things
that Kaleshwar was saying in

00:25:31.020 --> 00:25:34.470 align:middle line:84%
that there was a time
window where she was alone

00:25:34.470 --> 00:25:35.920 align:middle line:90%
with his body.

00:25:35.920 --> 00:25:39.010 align:middle line:84%
Nicodemus had taken
him off the cross,

00:25:39.010 --> 00:25:42.600 align:middle line:84%
and I believe it was Joseph
of Arimathea-- she was alone

00:25:42.600 --> 00:25:44.380 align:middle line:90%
with him in the tomb.

00:25:44.380 --> 00:25:47.590 align:middle line:84%
So we have that in the
Christian tradition,

00:25:47.590 --> 00:25:50.200 align:middle line:84%
so it's not like Sri Kaleshwar
is just making this up.

00:25:50.200 --> 00:25:53.867 align:middle line:84%
And I doubt that Sri
Kaleshwar was reading Maximus.

00:25:53.867 --> 00:25:54.700 align:middle line:90%
He was just pulling.

00:25:54.700 --> 00:25:57.320 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: It was Pontius Pilate
that allowed her to be with

00:25:57.320 --> 00:25:58.120 align:middle line:90%
him--

00:25:58.120 --> 00:25:58.920 align:middle line:84%
>>RIGOGLIOSO: Yeah,
to have the body--

00:25:58.920 --> 00:26:00.128 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: --to have the body.

00:26:00.128 --> 00:26:02.510 align:middle line:84%
>>RIGOGLIOSO: --because they
were interring or entombing

00:26:02.510 --> 00:26:03.310 align:middle line:90%
the body.

00:26:03.310 --> 00:26:04.240 align:middle line:90%
So she was there.

00:26:04.240 --> 00:26:06.330 align:middle line:84%
So she was literally
the first person

00:26:06.330 --> 00:26:08.010 align:middle line:84%
who saw the
Resurrection because she

00:26:08.010 --> 00:26:10.750 align:middle line:84%
was the person who
orchestrated the Resurrection,

00:26:10.750 --> 00:26:12.560 align:middle line:90%
according to Kaleshwar.

00:26:12.560 --> 00:26:13.360 align:middle line:90%
All right?

00:26:13.360 --> 00:26:20.100 align:middle line:84%
Now, he says that she
resurrected him body and soul

00:26:20.100 --> 00:26:22.253 align:middle line:90%
and that he then went to India.

00:26:22.253 --> 00:26:23.670 align:middle line:84%
And it's very
interesting because,

00:26:23.670 --> 00:26:26.170 align:middle line:84%
in the Muslim
tradition, in the Quran,

00:26:26.170 --> 00:26:30.776 align:middle line:84%
it's controversial as to whether
he came back to life or not.

00:26:30.776 --> 00:26:34.410 align:middle line:84%
Even in the Christian Bible,
it's a little ambiguous.

00:26:34.410 --> 00:26:36.560 align:middle line:84%
Are they seeing a vision
of him, or are they

00:26:36.560 --> 00:26:38.600 align:middle line:90%
seeing a physical body of him?

00:26:38.600 --> 00:26:40.520 align:middle line:84%
Whatever the case
may be, we don't

00:26:40.520 --> 00:26:42.090 align:middle line:90%
have to get divided over that.

00:26:42.090 --> 00:26:45.290 align:middle line:84%
We can see possible timelines
according to whatever

00:26:45.290 --> 00:26:46.580 align:middle line:90%
medicine people need.

00:26:46.580 --> 00:26:50.750 align:middle line:84%
Some, it's helpful to see that
he physically went to India.

00:26:50.750 --> 00:26:56.960 align:middle line:84%
Some, it's helpful to feel
that he resurrected his soul

00:26:56.960 --> 00:27:01.080 align:middle line:84%
and was available then to
people on the astral plane.

00:27:01.080 --> 00:27:05.540 align:middle line:84%
Whatever the case may be,
she was responsible for that

00:27:05.540 --> 00:27:07.800 align:middle line:90%
through her womb power.

00:27:07.800 --> 00:27:11.360 align:middle line:84%
And that's what Kaleshwar is
trying to show women today,

00:27:11.360 --> 00:27:14.480 align:middle line:84%
that we have this
type of womb power

00:27:14.480 --> 00:27:18.490 align:middle line:84%
not only for conception but for
resurrection, for the healing

00:27:18.490 --> 00:27:19.290 align:middle line:90%
of other people.

00:27:19.290 --> 00:27:21.530 align:middle line:84%
And so these are the kinds of
things that I and others are

00:27:21.530 --> 00:27:22.380 align:middle line:90%
exploring.

00:27:22.380 --> 00:27:26.030 align:middle line:84%
And this is one of
the teaching streams

00:27:26.030 --> 00:27:28.830 align:middle line:84%
that this unveiling
of Mother Mary

00:27:28.830 --> 00:27:30.930 align:middle line:84%
is bringing forth
for people today

00:27:30.930 --> 00:27:35.220 align:middle line:84%
so that we can go about
this grand restoration

00:27:35.220 --> 00:27:37.830 align:middle line:84%
of the feminine and the
healing of humanity that

00:27:37.830 --> 00:27:40.290 align:middle line:90%
is needed at this time.

00:27:40.290 --> 00:27:44.700 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: A couple of things
pop to mind as you're talking.

00:27:44.700 --> 00:27:49.240 align:middle line:84%
Do you think Kaleshwar may have
had a kind of a perceptual bias?

00:27:49.240 --> 00:27:53.100 align:middle line:84%
Because it's in the Indian
traditions that Jesus was there

00:27:53.100 --> 00:27:56.230 align:middle line:84%
physically and studied
there for years.

00:27:56.230 --> 00:27:57.330 align:middle line:90%
>>RIGOGLIOSO: Yeah.

00:27:57.330 --> 00:27:59.762 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Do you think it's--

00:27:59.762 --> 00:28:00.970 align:middle line:90%
what do you think about that?

00:28:00.970 --> 00:28:03.030 align:middle line:84%
>>RIGOGLIOSO: Yeah, I
think he's drawing on that.

00:28:03.030 --> 00:28:05.430 align:middle line:84%
He's drawing on that,
knowing that most

00:28:05.430 --> 00:28:07.990 align:middle line:84%
of us in the Western
traditions don't know about.

00:28:07.990 --> 00:28:08.220 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: No.

00:28:08.220 --> 00:28:09.020 align:middle line:90%
Right.

00:28:09.020 --> 00:28:12.460 align:middle line:84%
>>RIGOGLIOSO: So it may well
be that before his crucifixion,

00:28:12.460 --> 00:28:15.850 align:middle line:84%
he was going to India to
learn from some of these sages

00:28:15.850 --> 00:28:19.150 align:middle line:84%
because even though you
come in as a divine avatar,

00:28:19.150 --> 00:28:21.010 align:middle line:90%
it's not just all there.

00:28:21.010 --> 00:28:23.980 align:middle line:84%
You still need your
people to help you learn.

00:28:23.980 --> 00:28:25.480 align:middle line:84%
The same was true
with Mother Mary.

00:28:25.480 --> 00:28:28.440 align:middle line:84%
She was divinely born as an
avatar from her mother Anne,

00:28:28.440 --> 00:28:31.200 align:middle line:84%
but she needed to be
trained by the priestesses

00:28:31.200 --> 00:28:35.280 align:middle line:84%
to awaken the codes
that were within her.

00:28:35.280 --> 00:28:39.380 align:middle line:84%
So Jesus may have gone to
India before the events

00:28:39.380 --> 00:28:42.870 align:middle line:84%
of his ministry and
after his crucifixion.

00:28:42.870 --> 00:28:44.280 align:middle line:90%
I mean, it is a possibility.

00:28:44.280 --> 00:28:47.420 align:middle line:84%
Apparently, there are
things in the rocks that

00:28:47.420 --> 00:28:48.990 align:middle line:90%
attest to his presence there.

00:28:48.990 --> 00:28:49.790 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:28:49.790 --> 00:28:52.135 align:middle line:84%
>>RIGOGLIOSO: So I think
this is a great further level

00:28:52.135 --> 00:28:53.510 align:middle line:84%
of the mystery
that's going to be

00:28:53.510 --> 00:28:55.028 align:middle line:90%
unfolding over the next decade.

00:28:55.028 --> 00:28:56.070 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: I think so too.

00:28:56.070 --> 00:28:59.060 align:middle line:84%
And, again, if we can
imagine the magnitude

00:28:59.060 --> 00:29:03.620 align:middle line:84%
of these souls that incarnate
at key periods of time

00:29:03.620 --> 00:29:06.650 align:middle line:84%
to awaken and educate
humanity, they

00:29:06.650 --> 00:29:09.000 align:middle line:84%
have to be trained once
they come into a body.

00:29:09.000 --> 00:29:10.980 align:middle line:90%
And, again, looking back--

00:29:10.980 --> 00:29:14.540 align:middle line:84%
I look at things through
a multidimensional lens.

00:29:14.540 --> 00:29:17.700 align:middle line:84%
And looking back to
the entity of Horus,

00:29:17.700 --> 00:29:21.780 align:middle line:84%
the progeny of both
Osiris and Isis,

00:29:21.780 --> 00:29:24.630 align:middle line:84%
the great creative forces
within the universe,

00:29:24.630 --> 00:29:29.740 align:middle line:84%
one of the identities there
may be that Horus is actually

00:29:29.740 --> 00:29:32.510 align:middle line:84%
what's called, in
hermetic parlance,

00:29:32.510 --> 00:29:34.810 align:middle line:90%
the higher mind of the sun.

00:29:34.810 --> 00:29:35.890 align:middle line:90%
>>RIGOGLIOSO: Yeah.

00:29:35.890 --> 00:29:40.570 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And that brings an
incredibly potent potential

00:29:40.570 --> 00:29:42.940 align:middle line:84%
to our understanding of
who these entities are

00:29:42.940 --> 00:29:46.100 align:middle line:84%
and the power they possess
to heal on this planet.

00:29:46.100 --> 00:29:47.570 align:middle line:90%
We can't live without the sun.

00:29:47.570 --> 00:29:48.695 align:middle line:90%
>>RIGOGLIOSO: That's right.

00:29:48.695 --> 00:29:52.900 align:middle line:84%
And it helps us to understand
that ancient conception

00:29:52.900 --> 00:29:57.340 align:middle line:84%
of the stars, of the planets,
the consciousness that they

00:29:57.340 --> 00:30:00.500 align:middle line:84%
embody, the medicine
that they offer to us.

00:30:00.500 --> 00:30:03.910 align:middle line:84%
So it's more of a-- it expands
us into a cosmic realm.

00:30:03.910 --> 00:30:08.697 align:middle line:84%
And Mother Mary is
a cosmic star being.

00:30:08.697 --> 00:30:09.530 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Has to be.

00:30:09.530 --> 00:30:12.030 align:middle line:84%
>>RIGOGLIOSO: And William Henry
is talking a lot about that.

00:30:12.030 --> 00:30:15.610 align:middle line:84%
And she really has a strong
connection with the Pleiades.

00:30:15.610 --> 00:30:18.427 align:middle line:84%
Both William and I are
seeing that very strongly.

00:30:18.427 --> 00:30:20.260 align:middle line:84%
And what I have received
in my Oracle states

00:30:20.260 --> 00:30:23.260 align:middle line:84%
is-- you know how there are the
seven sisters of the Pleiades

00:30:23.260 --> 00:30:27.750 align:middle line:84%
that are considered the seven
star mother seeders of humanity?

00:30:27.750 --> 00:30:29.690 align:middle line:84%
What I have received
is that Mother Mary is

00:30:29.690 --> 00:30:34.200 align:middle line:84%
the eighth Pleiadean sister,
bringing forth another avatar

00:30:34.200 --> 00:30:41.690 align:middle line:84%
and for our time right
now and that Jesus then

00:30:41.690 --> 00:30:46.700 align:middle line:84%
connected with Mary Magdalene,
that they had conceptions

00:30:46.700 --> 00:30:50.360 align:middle line:84%
together, and that
their children have now

00:30:50.360 --> 00:30:52.280 align:middle line:84%
gone through the
family tree of humanity

00:30:52.280 --> 00:30:54.920 align:middle line:84%
all around the planet,
such that there has been

00:30:54.920 --> 00:30:59.240 align:middle line:84%
a critical completion
in the human family,

00:30:59.240 --> 00:31:02.850 align:middle line:84%
such that everybody
now has their DNA.

00:31:02.850 --> 00:31:05.240 align:middle line:84%
And that is what the
second coming actually

00:31:05.240 --> 00:31:10.590 align:middle line:84%
is, that this DNA from their
lineage is now within all of us.

00:31:10.590 --> 00:31:14.840 align:middle line:84%
And now we can continue to
turn on the lights within us

00:31:14.840 --> 00:31:20.000 align:middle line:84%
of this Jesus and Magdalene
DNA so that we can fully

00:31:20.000 --> 00:31:22.250 align:middle line:90%
awaken our consciousness.

00:31:22.250 --> 00:31:24.150 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes, beautifully said.

00:31:24.150 --> 00:31:28.000 align:middle line:84%
And then we start looking at how
this bridges into other subjects

00:31:28.000 --> 00:31:32.740 align:middle line:84%
too, such as ufology and
extraterrestrials, the notions

00:31:32.740 --> 00:31:38.320 align:middle line:84%
of the fact that the Pleiadians
had been here on Planet Earth

00:31:38.320 --> 00:31:42.380 align:middle line:84%
long, long, long ago and are
coming back in more numbers now,

00:31:42.380 --> 00:31:44.350 align:middle line:84%
and people are
channeling them more now,

00:31:44.350 --> 00:31:49.450 align:middle line:84%
and understanding these
vast entities, such as Mary,

00:31:49.450 --> 00:31:51.710 align:middle line:84%
show themselves wherever
they need to be.

00:31:51.710 --> 00:31:53.665 align:middle line:84%
Pleiades was just
another stop too--

00:31:53.665 --> 00:31:54.790 align:middle line:90%
>>RIGOGLIOSO: That's right.

00:31:54.790 --> 00:31:57.250 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: --that these are
eternal, non-physical beings who

00:31:57.250 --> 00:32:01.480 align:middle line:84%
can incarnate at any level in
any planetary system they wish

00:32:01.480 --> 00:32:06.430 align:middle line:84%
to be able to bring that kind
of love, wisdom, knowledge

00:32:06.430 --> 00:32:07.490 align:middle line:90%
to a planet.

00:32:07.490 --> 00:32:10.105 align:middle line:84%
So that may have been
just a stop for Mary--

00:32:10.105 --> 00:32:11.230 align:middle line:90%
>>RIGOGLIOSO: That's right.

00:32:11.230 --> 00:32:12.860 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: --to be
the eighth sister.

00:32:12.860 --> 00:32:14.030 align:middle line:90%
And then she comes here.

00:32:14.030 --> 00:32:15.940 align:middle line:84%
Who knows what
planetary system she'll

00:32:15.940 --> 00:32:18.110 align:middle line:84%
go on to next time--
they'll all go on to?

00:32:18.110 --> 00:32:18.910 align:middle line:90%
>>RIGOGLIOSO: Yes.

00:32:18.910 --> 00:32:22.230 align:middle line:84%
And I think they all are
fractalized presences.

00:32:22.230 --> 00:32:23.730 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Yes, and
then they remain.

00:32:23.730 --> 00:32:26.270 align:middle line:84%
Yes, they leave the remainder
of that being there, yeah.

00:32:26.270 --> 00:32:27.070 align:middle line:90%
>>RIGOGLIOSO: Yeah.

00:32:27.070 --> 00:32:31.440 align:middle line:84%
And what they're showing
us is not just so much

00:32:31.440 --> 00:32:34.540 align:middle line:84%
that there are these
beings but, again,

00:32:34.540 --> 00:32:39.000 align:middle line:84%
that we are these beings because
the original human template is

00:32:39.000 --> 00:32:40.980 align:middle line:90%
divine angelic.

00:32:40.980 --> 00:32:43.600 align:middle line:84%
And it is written in
The Gnostic Gospels,

00:32:43.600 --> 00:32:45.960 align:middle line:84%
and I've talked
a lot about this.

00:32:45.960 --> 00:32:50.370 align:middle line:84%
They are here again to
awaken this Sophia Christos

00:32:50.370 --> 00:32:53.430 align:middle line:84%
bright light within
us so that we

00:32:53.430 --> 00:32:58.920 align:middle line:84%
can return to our angelic
abilities, presence,

00:32:58.920 --> 00:33:03.240 align:middle line:84%
and transmutations on
the planet to really turn

00:33:03.240 --> 00:33:05.910 align:middle line:90%
Spaceship Earth around.

00:33:05.910 --> 00:33:08.460 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: To start connecting
with our own higher minds.

00:33:08.460 --> 00:33:11.190 align:middle line:84%
I mean, really, if we just
did that one thing, everything

00:33:11.190 --> 00:33:12.190 align:middle line:90%
changes overnight.

00:33:12.190 --> 00:33:15.340 align:middle line:84%
If someone could
simply do a blast,

00:33:15.340 --> 00:33:18.925 align:middle line:84%
took everyone up to their own
higher mind, it's accomplished.

00:33:18.925 --> 00:33:20.050 align:middle line:90%
>>RIGOGLIOSO: That's right.

00:33:20.050 --> 00:33:20.470 align:middle line:90%
That's right.

00:33:20.470 --> 00:33:22.220 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: That's all we
need, but we don't use that.

00:33:22.220 --> 00:33:23.902 align:middle line:84%
We just keep
bumping into things.

00:33:23.902 --> 00:33:26.110 align:middle line:84%
Very few people actually
connect with the higher mind

00:33:26.110 --> 00:33:27.290 align:middle line:90%
on a conscious level.

00:33:27.290 --> 00:33:28.985 align:middle line:84%
Just get little
glimpses through dreams.

00:33:28.985 --> 00:33:30.110 align:middle line:90%
>>RIGOGLIOSO: That's right.

00:33:30.110 --> 00:33:33.340 align:middle line:84%
And that's why a lot of people
are using deep meditation

00:33:33.340 --> 00:33:35.630 align:middle line:84%
practices, deep
medicine practices

00:33:35.630 --> 00:33:38.950 align:middle line:84%
because it will get you in touch
with higher mind, which I just

00:33:38.950 --> 00:33:41.630 align:middle line:84%
described one experience
of it, meeting Mother Mary.

00:33:41.630 --> 00:33:43.790 align:middle line:90%
I was in that realm.

00:33:43.790 --> 00:33:45.825 align:middle line:90%
I was in the seventh dimension.

00:33:45.825 --> 00:33:47.450 align:middle line:84%
And I know there are
higher dimensions,

00:33:47.450 --> 00:33:49.867 align:middle line:84%
but I was lying there going,
I'm in the seventh dimension.

00:33:49.867 --> 00:33:53.050 align:middle line:84%
But also-- and I know
you'll appreciate this--

00:33:53.050 --> 00:33:56.540 align:middle line:84%
as much as the mind, it's
the dimension of the heart.

00:33:56.540 --> 00:33:57.560 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Absolutely.

00:33:57.560 --> 00:33:58.360 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

00:33:58.360 --> 00:34:01.430 align:middle line:84%
And recently, Lee Harrison
and I did a book together.

00:34:01.430 --> 00:34:05.470 align:middle line:84%
And one of the things that the
Z's said that is so beautiful

00:34:05.470 --> 00:34:10.100 align:middle line:84%
about humanity and coming
up full-blown for humanity--

00:34:10.100 --> 00:34:13.510 align:middle line:84%
in fact, they used literally
92% of the population is what

00:34:13.510 --> 00:34:14.590 align:middle line:90%
we're moving into--

00:34:14.590 --> 00:34:17.199 align:middle line:84%
is that that higher
mind is going to be

00:34:17.199 --> 00:34:18.530 align:middle line:90%
connecting through the heart.

00:34:18.530 --> 00:34:18.949 align:middle line:90%
>>RIGOGLIOSO: That's right.

00:34:18.949 --> 00:34:20.690 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And so
our knowledge base,

00:34:20.690 --> 00:34:22.679 align:middle line:84%
our decision-making,
everything is

00:34:22.679 --> 00:34:27.060 align:middle line:84%
done in a much higher, much
more refined way than trying

00:34:27.060 --> 00:34:28.927 align:middle line:84%
to use the lower mind,
the conscious mind.

00:34:28.927 --> 00:34:30.760 align:middle line:84%
>>RIGOGLIOSO: And you
see, that's the Marys.

00:34:30.760 --> 00:34:32.087 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:34:32.087 --> 00:34:32.920 align:middle line:90%
>>RIGOGLIOSO: Right?

00:34:32.920 --> 00:34:35.040 align:middle line:84%
And also, what's
united is not just

00:34:35.040 --> 00:34:37.170 align:middle line:90%
mind and heart but the womb.

00:34:37.170 --> 00:34:39.420 align:middle line:84%
Because Sri Kaleshwar
said the womb

00:34:39.420 --> 00:34:42.940 align:middle line:84%
is nothing but
Prema, which is love.

00:34:42.940 --> 00:34:43.969 align:middle line:90%
So these three chakras--

00:34:43.969 --> 00:34:45.719 align:middle line:84%
and, of course, all
the chakras are really

00:34:45.719 --> 00:34:49.440 align:middle line:84%
holographically linked in
our entire Merkaba field.

00:34:49.440 --> 00:34:52.860 align:middle line:84%
But that's what the feminine
and the Marys are bringing in,

00:34:52.860 --> 00:34:57.900 align:middle line:84%
is this loving, wise love
because they are manifestations

00:34:57.900 --> 00:35:04.560 align:middle line:84%
of Sophia, who is wisdom, who
is love, who is higher mind,

00:35:04.560 --> 00:35:05.950 align:middle line:90%
and who is the womb.

00:35:05.950 --> 00:35:09.750 align:middle line:84%
Even the ancients called
her [NON-ENGLISH], the womb.

00:35:09.750 --> 00:35:16.120 align:middle line:84%
So that is also why the
feminine return is so needed.

00:35:16.120 --> 00:35:19.580 align:middle line:84%
Because it is integrating, it
is weaving all of these things,

00:35:19.580 --> 00:35:22.120 align:middle line:84%
and that's why the Marys
were known as the weavers.

00:35:22.120 --> 00:35:23.360 align:middle line:90%
Well, what were they weaving?

00:35:23.360 --> 00:35:27.980 align:middle line:84%
It wasn't just the veil at the
entrance to the Holy of Holies.

00:35:27.980 --> 00:35:31.420 align:middle line:84%
It was the literal
veil of reality.

00:35:31.420 --> 00:35:35.680 align:middle line:84%
And that's what we are
bringing together again.

00:35:35.680 --> 00:35:38.660 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And when
I hear you say womb,

00:35:38.660 --> 00:35:41.380 align:middle line:84%
I always go back
to prima materia,

00:35:41.380 --> 00:35:43.940 align:middle line:84%
the base of which all
creation comes from.

00:35:43.940 --> 00:35:44.740 align:middle line:90%
>>RIGOGLIOSO: Yeah.

00:35:44.740 --> 00:35:47.232 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And so one of the
things in your book that was

00:35:47.232 --> 00:35:49.690 align:middle line:84%
interesting-- let's just talk
about this for a little bit--

00:35:49.690 --> 00:35:50.490 align:middle line:90%
was--

00:35:50.490 --> 00:35:53.450 align:middle line:84%
and you alluded to it earlier
that Mary died cheerfully.

00:35:53.450 --> 00:35:57.455 align:middle line:84%
So let's talk about the entire
scene around Mary's deathbed.

00:35:57.455 --> 00:35:59.080 align:middle line:84%
And one of the things
she said in there

00:35:59.080 --> 00:36:03.700 align:middle line:84%
is that the priest sent 30 men
in to take Mary and the apostles

00:36:03.700 --> 00:36:05.780 align:middle line:90%
into custody at one point.

00:36:05.780 --> 00:36:07.150 align:middle line:90%
What's that about?

00:36:07.150 --> 00:36:08.690 align:middle line:90%
Did I get this stuff conflated?

00:36:08.690 --> 00:36:11.080 align:middle line:84%
And then Jesus was
there, and people

00:36:11.080 --> 00:36:13.460 align:middle line:84%
started being healed
around her deathbed.

00:36:13.460 --> 00:36:16.225 align:middle line:84%
So tell us the story that I've
probably totally jumbled here.

00:36:16.225 --> 00:36:17.600 align:middle line:84%
>>RIGOGLIOSO: No,
no, it's great.

00:36:17.600 --> 00:36:19.920 align:middle line:90%
You've gotten all the pieces.

00:36:19.920 --> 00:36:23.010 align:middle line:84%
This is really
important because I

00:36:23.010 --> 00:36:24.870 align:middle line:84%
looked into her
ancient biographies

00:36:24.870 --> 00:36:26.950 align:middle line:84%
about this so-called
death passage,

00:36:26.950 --> 00:36:32.710 align:middle line:84%
which, in the Western Church,
it's called the Assumption.

00:36:32.710 --> 00:36:35.238 align:middle line:84%
And in the Eastern Church,
it's called the Dormition,

00:36:35.238 --> 00:36:36.780 align:middle line:84%
that she either went
to sleep, or she

00:36:36.780 --> 00:36:38.697 align:middle line:84%
was assumed into heaven
that she didn't really

00:36:38.697 --> 00:36:40.710 align:middle line:90%
die, which is true.

00:36:40.710 --> 00:36:43.870 align:middle line:84%
She left her body, but
she went rainbow body.

00:36:43.870 --> 00:36:47.075 align:middle line:84%
It was like those monks who just
shriveled down to nothingness,

00:36:47.075 --> 00:36:48.450 align:middle line:84%
and then rainbow
lights appeared.

00:36:48.450 --> 00:36:49.600 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: That William
Henry talks about.

00:36:49.600 --> 00:36:50.725 align:middle line:90%
>>RIGOGLIOSO: That's right.

00:36:50.725 --> 00:36:54.100 align:middle line:84%
This literally happened, and
it is in her biographies.

00:36:54.100 --> 00:36:56.430 align:middle line:84%
But a little bit
more of the story

00:36:56.430 --> 00:37:00.730 align:middle line:84%
is that she started to be
able to predict her death.

00:37:00.730 --> 00:37:04.270 align:middle line:84%
I think she was around or
in her 80s at this point.

00:37:04.270 --> 00:37:06.630 align:middle line:84%
She had been a
leader and a mentor

00:37:06.630 --> 00:37:10.950 align:middle line:84%
to all these apostles
who would come and go

00:37:10.950 --> 00:37:12.400 align:middle line:90%
in the ancient world.

00:37:12.400 --> 00:37:13.680 align:middle line:90%
And it was time.

00:37:13.680 --> 00:37:15.010 align:middle line:90%
She knew.

00:37:15.010 --> 00:37:18.110 align:middle line:84%
And so this had to be
a very high ritual,

00:37:18.110 --> 00:37:19.830 align:middle line:84%
and she couldn't
have her body burned.

00:37:19.830 --> 00:37:21.720 align:middle line:84%
That was one of
her major prayers,

00:37:21.720 --> 00:37:24.120 align:middle line:84%
was that they wouldn't
come and burn her body

00:37:24.120 --> 00:37:25.910 align:middle line:84%
so that she could have
this rainbow light

00:37:25.910 --> 00:37:29.010 align:middle line:84%
experience and her full
ascension into goddesshood.

00:37:29.010 --> 00:37:34.200 align:middle line:84%
And the way it's described is
that it was happening in 3D,

00:37:34.200 --> 00:37:37.190 align:middle line:84%
but it was also happening in the
interdimensional levels so that

00:37:37.190 --> 00:37:39.780 align:middle line:84%
you had physical people
coming to tend to her.

00:37:39.780 --> 00:37:43.160 align:middle line:84%
All the virgins who were
her devoted assistants

00:37:43.160 --> 00:37:44.250 align:middle line:90%
were with her.

00:37:44.250 --> 00:37:47.720 align:middle line:84%
And then there were these beings
who had already crossed over

00:37:47.720 --> 00:37:48.990 align:middle line:90%
to the other side--

00:37:48.990 --> 00:37:53.660 align:middle line:84%
her mother, her Aunt
Elizabeth, all of these.

00:37:53.660 --> 00:37:57.570 align:middle line:84%
And so this description
is really remarkable.

00:37:57.570 --> 00:37:59.450 align:middle line:84%
And if you know how
to read it, which

00:37:59.450 --> 00:38:03.170 align:middle line:84%
I help people to do in this
book, The Secret Life of Mother

00:38:03.170 --> 00:38:06.000 align:middle line:84%
Mary, you really
understand that, oh,

00:38:06.000 --> 00:38:08.910 align:middle line:84%
this is describing an
extraordinary passage.

00:38:08.910 --> 00:38:11.520 align:middle line:90%
This is not just made-up--

00:38:11.520 --> 00:38:12.320 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:38:12.320 --> 00:38:13.520 align:middle line:90%
>>RIGOGLIOSO: --fantasy.

00:38:13.520 --> 00:38:15.990 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So why were
these men sent in?

00:38:15.990 --> 00:38:22.270 align:middle line:84%
>>RIGOGLIOSO: Well,
they cared about her.

00:38:22.270 --> 00:38:25.420 align:middle line:84%
Peter loved her as much
as Mary Magdalene did.

00:38:25.420 --> 00:38:27.730 align:middle line:84%
He had total honor
toward Mother Mary.

00:38:27.730 --> 00:38:30.970 align:middle line:84%
He had no problems with her the
way he did with Mary Magdalene.

00:38:30.970 --> 00:38:33.010 align:middle line:84%
He was jealous of
Mary Magdalene.

00:38:33.010 --> 00:38:35.470 align:middle line:84%
He bowed to Mother
Mary continually.

00:38:35.470 --> 00:38:38.560 align:middle line:84%
But the other apostles
and disciples,

00:38:38.560 --> 00:38:42.180 align:middle line:84%
it was all of the
hallowed male masters

00:38:42.180 --> 00:38:45.660 align:middle line:84%
were coming into this
gathering, as well as

00:38:45.660 --> 00:38:49.080 align:middle line:84%
the female, both who
were still on the planet

00:38:49.080 --> 00:38:54.090 align:middle line:84%
and who were off-planet,
the ancestors essentially.

00:38:54.090 --> 00:38:57.160 align:middle line:90%
And Jesus came for this as well.

00:38:57.160 --> 00:39:02.260 align:middle line:84%
And they began a certain
ritualized praying.

00:39:02.260 --> 00:39:05.860 align:middle line:84%
They began a Hallelujah,
which means a sacred sounding,

00:39:05.860 --> 00:39:07.800 align:middle line:90%
a kind of a light language.

00:39:07.800 --> 00:39:10.300 align:middle line:90%
And they helped Mary--

00:39:10.300 --> 00:39:13.020 align:middle line:84%
literally, her
soul leave her body

00:39:13.020 --> 00:39:16.070 align:middle line:84%
and cross over into
the higher dimensions

00:39:16.070 --> 00:39:20.180 align:middle line:84%
where she had quite the
experience, whereas most people

00:39:20.180 --> 00:39:24.230 align:middle line:84%
have the experience of having
to encounter the powers of wrath

00:39:24.230 --> 00:39:28.418 align:middle line:84%
at each doorway where
you have an initiation

00:39:28.418 --> 00:39:29.960 align:middle line:84%
that you have to
get through in order

00:39:29.960 --> 00:39:31.290 align:middle line:90%
to get to the higher realms.

00:39:31.290 --> 00:39:33.120 align:middle line:84%
She had already
accomplished all that.

00:39:33.120 --> 00:39:37.560 align:middle line:84%
She was already going to these
higher and higher dimensions,

00:39:37.560 --> 00:39:41.310 align:middle line:84%
and she was also seeing what was
going to happen to Planet Earth.

00:39:41.310 --> 00:39:45.920 align:middle line:84%
So she was witnessing the
trauma, the hell realms,

00:39:45.920 --> 00:39:48.120 align:middle line:90%
and this sort of thing.

00:39:48.120 --> 00:39:51.750 align:middle line:84%
But she made it to the
highest level of the pleroma.

00:39:51.750 --> 00:39:54.090 align:middle line:90%
That was her final ascension.

00:39:54.090 --> 00:39:58.730 align:middle line:84%
And it was a very great ritual
that all of these major beings

00:39:58.730 --> 00:40:00.880 align:middle line:84%
were associated
with in helping her.

00:40:00.880 --> 00:40:02.880 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And there were
healings along the way?

00:40:02.880 --> 00:40:03.680 align:middle line:90%
>>RIGOGLIOSO: Yes.

00:40:03.680 --> 00:40:08.180 align:middle line:84%
So before, during, and
after this passing,

00:40:08.180 --> 00:40:10.140 align:middle line:84%
these phenomena
started happening.

00:40:10.140 --> 00:40:13.080 align:middle line:84%
Loud voices above
where she was staying.

00:40:13.080 --> 00:40:14.980 align:middle line:84%
She was transported
from one place

00:40:14.980 --> 00:40:17.230 align:middle line:84%
to another because
there were mobs trying

00:40:17.230 --> 00:40:19.010 align:middle line:90%
to come in and take her body.

00:40:19.010 --> 00:40:22.790 align:middle line:84%
There would be fire
issuing out from her house.

00:40:22.790 --> 00:40:26.030 align:middle line:84%
And I talk in the book, The
Secret Life of Mother Mary,

00:40:26.030 --> 00:40:31.930 align:middle line:84%
about ancillary experiences
that have happened on the Earth

00:40:31.930 --> 00:40:36.550 align:middle line:84%
plane that show us that this
was not just a made-up story,

00:40:36.550 --> 00:40:40.660 align:middle line:84%
that these were actual
phenomena, energetic things that

00:40:40.660 --> 00:40:43.450 align:middle line:84%
were happening to
protect her and her body

00:40:43.450 --> 00:40:47.440 align:middle line:84%
and alert people a
big thing is happening

00:40:47.440 --> 00:40:50.540 align:middle line:84%
on the planet this major
master is planning.

00:40:50.540 --> 00:40:52.940 align:middle line:84%
This is a doorway of
tremendous healing.

00:40:52.940 --> 00:40:57.226 align:middle line:84%
And so many people
in her locality--

00:40:57.226 --> 00:41:01.490 align:middle line:84%
she was transported from
Jerusalem to Bethlehem,

00:41:01.490 --> 00:41:04.180 align:middle line:84%
back to Jerusalem--
they would come back,

00:41:04.180 --> 00:41:08.860 align:middle line:84%
and they would come to her,
and they would experience,

00:41:08.860 --> 00:41:13.550 align:middle line:84%
and they describe
healings of bladder

00:41:13.550 --> 00:41:17.760 align:middle line:84%
and leprosy and exorcisms
that she was doing.

00:41:17.760 --> 00:41:19.200 align:middle line:90%
She was a great exorcist.

00:41:19.200 --> 00:41:21.800 align:middle line:84%
All the things that she was
doing in her lifetime, which

00:41:21.800 --> 00:41:24.020 align:middle line:84%
we don't know about,
but I do write about,

00:41:24.020 --> 00:41:25.830 align:middle line:90%
she was doing in a massive way.

00:41:25.830 --> 00:41:31.520 align:middle line:84%
And it says in the Dormition
narratives that 2,600 people

00:41:31.520 --> 00:41:33.960 align:middle line:84%
were healed this
way, including--

00:41:33.960 --> 00:41:35.610 align:middle line:90%
and she would travel outward.

00:41:35.610 --> 00:41:38.390 align:middle line:84%
She was doing remote healings
while this was happening.

00:41:38.390 --> 00:41:40.380 align:middle line:90%
Sailors lost at sea.

00:41:40.380 --> 00:41:41.220 align:middle line:90%
She was coming.

00:41:41.220 --> 00:41:43.890 align:middle line:84%
She was appearing as
light to these people.

00:41:43.890 --> 00:41:46.860 align:middle line:84%
A child who had
fallen down a well.

00:41:46.860 --> 00:41:49.550 align:middle line:84%
These kinds of miracles
were happening all

00:41:49.550 --> 00:41:53.230 align:middle line:84%
while she was going through this
mahasamadhi, this great death

00:41:53.230 --> 00:41:54.030 align:middle line:90%
passage.

00:41:54.030 --> 00:41:58.220 align:middle line:84%
So this was the final
firework display

00:41:58.220 --> 00:42:02.030 align:middle line:84%
at the end of the
fireworks, showing

00:42:02.030 --> 00:42:05.870 align:middle line:84%
Mother Mary as a tremendously
beautiful healer who--

00:42:05.870 --> 00:42:08.040 align:middle line:84%
and she was praying
for the Earth.

00:42:08.040 --> 00:42:11.220 align:middle line:84%
She understood what humanity
was going to go through.

00:42:11.220 --> 00:42:13.360 align:middle line:90%
She was really praying.

00:42:13.360 --> 00:42:17.720 align:middle line:84%
And she said, call
on me in these times.

00:42:17.720 --> 00:42:19.310 align:middle line:90%
Call on Jesus.

00:42:19.310 --> 00:42:20.270 align:middle line:90%
Call on me.

00:42:20.270 --> 00:42:23.710 align:middle line:84%
Use us as resources in
these times of tribulation

00:42:23.710 --> 00:42:25.340 align:middle line:84%
that you're going
to be experiencing.

00:42:25.340 --> 00:42:28.400 align:middle line:10%
And I do believe this
is what's happening now.

00:42:28.400 --> 00:42:32.720 align:middle line:10%
And, again, I don't express
this in a dogmatic way,

00:42:32.720 --> 00:42:37.400 align:middle line:10%
not in a programmed way, but
in an esoteric, mystical way

00:42:37.400 --> 00:42:40.850 align:middle line:10%
like, wow, who were
these beings, really?

00:42:40.850 --> 00:42:42.170 align:middle line:10%
Who are they?

00:42:42.170 --> 00:42:44.090 align:middle line:10%
How are they available to us?

00:42:44.090 --> 00:42:46.670 align:middle line:84%
How are they mirrors
for our own soul?

00:42:46.670 --> 00:42:51.040 align:middle line:84%
How are they really helping us
with this tremendous opportunity

00:42:51.040 --> 00:42:54.310 align:middle line:84%
of complete planetary awakening
that's at our disposal

00:42:54.310 --> 00:42:55.700 align:middle line:90%
right now?

00:42:55.700 --> 00:42:56.570 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Beautiful.

00:42:56.570 --> 00:42:58.790 align:middle line:84%
And a lot of this can all
be found in your book--

00:42:58.790 --> 00:42:59.080 align:middle line:90%
>>RIGOGLIOSO: Yes.

00:42:59.080 --> 00:43:00.413 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: --including exercises.

00:43:00.413 --> 00:43:01.213 align:middle line:90%
>>RIGOGLIOSO: Yes.

00:43:01.213 --> 00:43:03.473 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And so I thank
you so much for continuing

00:43:03.473 --> 00:43:05.140 align:middle line:84%
to do your research,
and I've thoroughly

00:43:05.140 --> 00:43:06.500 align:middle line:90%
enjoyed this conversation.

00:43:06.500 --> 00:43:06.950 align:middle line:90%
>>RIGOGLIOSO: Thank you.

00:43:06.950 --> 00:43:08.750 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: It's a very
healing conversation.

00:43:08.750 --> 00:43:11.490 align:middle line:84%
And so before we go, maybe
you can interpret my dream

00:43:11.490 --> 00:43:12.370 align:middle line:90%
from last night.

00:43:12.370 --> 00:43:12.850 align:middle line:90%
>>RIGOGLIOSO: Oh, OK.

00:43:12.850 --> 00:43:13.650 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: OK.

00:43:13.650 --> 00:43:16.540 align:middle line:84%
So my ex-husband and I
had a baby girl together.

00:43:16.540 --> 00:43:18.720 align:middle line:84%
Somehow, I was
unaware of everything

00:43:18.720 --> 00:43:21.810 align:middle line:84%
as he swept her away
and named her Henry.

00:43:21.810 --> 00:43:25.170 align:middle line:84%
And I said, oh no, her name
is supposed to be Olivia.

00:43:25.170 --> 00:43:28.002 align:middle line:90%
But she was already named Henry.

00:43:28.002 --> 00:43:30.190 align:middle line:84%
That was just before I
woke up in the wee hours

00:43:30.190 --> 00:43:32.380 align:middle line:84%
when I have all of the
wild, crazy dreams.

00:43:32.380 --> 00:43:33.180 align:middle line:90%
So--

00:43:33.180 --> 00:43:33.880 align:middle line:90%
>>RIGOGLIOSO: Wow.

00:43:33.880 --> 00:43:35.020 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Yeah, I
thought it was--

00:43:35.020 --> 00:43:36.727 align:middle line:84%
and I'm sitting here
with you right now.

00:43:36.727 --> 00:43:39.310 align:middle line:84%
Otherwise, I would have probably
forgotten the dream entirely.

00:43:39.310 --> 00:43:41.520 align:middle line:84%
I'm not asking you to
actually interpret it, but--

00:43:41.520 --> 00:43:43.270 align:middle line:84%
>>RIGOGLIOSO: I do
have an interpretation.

00:43:43.270 --> 00:43:44.103 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Please do.

00:43:44.103 --> 00:43:49.680 align:middle line:84%
>>RIGOGLIOSO: So what the dream
is expressing is that there are

00:43:49.680 --> 00:43:54.355 align:middle line:84%
many forces of negativity and
hijacking that are upon us--

00:43:54.355 --> 00:43:55.155 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:43:55.155 --> 00:43:56.363 align:middle line:90%
>>RIGOGLIOSO: --all the time.

00:43:56.363 --> 00:44:00.420 align:middle line:84%
And we're struggling
and fighting as we may.

00:44:00.420 --> 00:44:04.160 align:middle line:84%
You wanted to have your
child name what you wanted--

00:44:04.160 --> 00:44:04.960 align:middle line:90%
Olivia.

00:44:04.960 --> 00:44:08.440 align:middle line:84%
But what it came
through as is Henry,

00:44:08.440 --> 00:44:11.240 align:middle line:90%
which has to do with William.

00:44:11.240 --> 00:44:13.070 align:middle line:90%
It has to do with William Henry.

00:44:13.070 --> 00:44:16.630 align:middle line:84%
So it's really that even
though we are all still

00:44:16.630 --> 00:44:21.610 align:middle line:84%
struggling and fighting, these
blessings are still coming

00:44:21.610 --> 00:44:23.750 align:middle line:90%
in in the midst of it all.

00:44:23.750 --> 00:44:26.060 align:middle line:84%
And this is exactly what
happened with the Pleiades.

00:44:26.060 --> 00:44:30.370 align:middle line:84%
In order for them to conceive
large portions of humanity

00:44:30.370 --> 00:44:32.660 align:middle line:84%
and get Pleiadian DNA
into us, guess what?

00:44:32.660 --> 00:44:35.180 align:middle line:84%
They had to be raped
by the Anunnaki.

00:44:35.180 --> 00:44:36.170 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:44:36.170 --> 00:44:39.047 align:middle line:84%
And I did feel there was
a hijacking going on--

00:44:39.047 --> 00:44:41.130 align:middle line:84%
>>RIGOGLIOSO: Yeah, but
you will prevail because--

00:44:41.130 --> 00:44:43.340 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: --as this is a
female entity named Henry.

00:44:43.340 --> 00:44:44.140 align:middle line:90%
>>RIGOGLIOSO: Yes.

00:44:44.140 --> 00:44:47.943 align:middle line:84%
Well, because we're all here
doing this work together.

00:44:47.943 --> 00:44:48.860 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes, we are.

00:44:48.860 --> 00:44:50.330 align:middle line:84%
And, Marguerite,
thank you so much.

00:44:50.330 --> 00:44:51.890 align:middle line:84%
I really enjoyed
the conversation.

00:44:51.890 --> 00:44:52.460 align:middle line:90%
>>RIGOGLIOSO: You're welcome.

00:44:52.460 --> 00:44:53.680 align:middle line:90%
Thank you for having me.

00:44:53.680 --> 00:44:55.270 align:middle line:10%
>>REGINA: Again, the
title of the book

00:44:55.270 --> 00:44:57.350 align:middle line:10%
is The Secret Life
of Mother Mary.

00:44:57.350 --> 00:45:00.130 align:middle line:10%
You can also find my previous
conversations with Marguerite
