[THEME MUSIC]

00:00:27.664 --> 00:00:32.790 align:middle line:84%
>>Kundalini is spiritual energy,
the energy of consciousness,

00:00:32.790 --> 00:00:34.770 align:middle line:84%
which is thought to
reside at the base

00:00:34.770 --> 00:00:37.350 align:middle line:84%
of the spine of
every human body.

00:00:37.350 --> 00:00:41.410 align:middle line:84%
And when aroused, it brings
new states of consciousness,

00:00:41.410 --> 00:00:44.690 align:middle line:84%
including mystical
illumination, exalted

00:00:44.690 --> 00:00:50.220 align:middle line:84%
powers, ecstasy, bliss,
clairvoyance, healing,

00:00:50.220 --> 00:00:51.900 align:middle line:90%
and transcendence of self.

00:00:51.900 --> 00:00:54.130 align:middle line:84%
Why is information
about Kundalini

00:00:54.130 --> 00:00:56.710 align:middle line:84%
not spread to the
mainstream yet?

00:00:56.710 --> 00:01:01.080 align:middle line:84%
What is needed to recognize
this power within you?

00:01:01.080 --> 00:01:04.230 align:middle line:84%
This secret has been kept
hidden for centuries.

00:01:04.230 --> 00:01:08.320 align:middle line:84%
However, Kundalini is
within every human,

00:01:08.320 --> 00:01:11.790 align:middle line:84%
a resource of energy
that went fully awakened

00:01:11.790 --> 00:01:16.300 align:middle line:84%
allows us to reach our full
potential with joy, peace,

00:01:16.300 --> 00:01:17.680 align:middle line:90%
and unconditional love.

00:01:17.680 --> 00:01:19.780 align:middle line:90%


00:01:19.780 --> 00:01:21.280 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA MEREDITH:
If there was ever

00:01:21.280 --> 00:01:24.000 align:middle line:84%
a doubt that the position of
the planets in our solar system

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:26.160 align:middle line:84%
have an effect on how
our lives play out,

00:01:26.160 --> 00:01:28.150 align:middle line:84%
there won't be after
this interview.

00:01:28.150 --> 00:01:30.030 align:middle line:84%
Barbara Hand Clow
has invested decades

00:01:30.030 --> 00:01:33.570 align:middle line:84%
in investigating the delicate
matrix of cosmic effects

00:01:33.570 --> 00:01:36.020 align:middle line:84%
on our subtle bodies,
and how they affect us

00:01:36.020 --> 00:01:37.900 align:middle line:84%
during critical
times of our lives,

00:01:37.900 --> 00:01:40.160 align:middle line:90%
particularly midlife crises.

00:01:40.160 --> 00:01:42.490 align:middle line:84%
If we accept that there
is a template from birth,

00:01:42.490 --> 00:01:45.380 align:middle line:84%
then we can go through these
challenging periods of life

00:01:45.380 --> 00:01:46.930 align:middle line:90%
with grace and ease.

00:01:46.930 --> 00:01:49.690 align:middle line:84%
She's with us today to discuss
her new book "Astrology

00:01:49.690 --> 00:01:51.490 align:middle line:90%
and the Rising of Kundalini."

00:01:51.490 --> 00:01:52.580 align:middle line:90%
Welcome back.

00:01:52.580 --> 00:01:53.130 align:middle line:90%
Just--

00:01:53.130 --> 00:01:53.590 align:middle line:90%
>>BARBARA HAND CLOW: Hi, Regina.

00:01:53.590 --> 00:01:55.652 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: --you are so
popular among our viewers.

00:01:55.652 --> 00:01:57.610 align:middle line:84%
I've going to tell you,
the last two interviews

00:01:57.610 --> 00:02:00.300 align:middle line:84%
we did on "The Alchemy of
Nine Dimensions" lives on.

00:02:00.300 --> 00:02:01.050 align:middle line:90%
>>CLOW: Well good.

00:02:01.050 --> 00:02:03.260 align:middle line:90%
I'm happy to be here.

00:02:03.260 --> 00:02:06.790 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And this book,
it's a rewrite of one

00:02:06.790 --> 00:02:08.490 align:middle line:90%
that you wrote back in 1991.

00:02:08.490 --> 00:02:11.260 align:middle line:84%
Let's talk about a) why
you wrote the first one.

00:02:11.260 --> 00:02:12.720 align:middle line:90%
What prompted it?

00:02:12.720 --> 00:02:15.520 align:middle line:84%
And then b) why you felt
a need to rewrite it,

00:02:15.520 --> 00:02:18.550 align:middle line:84%
because I know there was a lot
of intervening of validation

00:02:18.550 --> 00:02:19.610 align:middle line:90%
through the years.

00:02:19.610 --> 00:02:22.500 align:middle line:84%
>>CLOW: Well, I was an
astrologer back in the 1970s

00:02:22.500 --> 00:02:26.580 align:middle line:84%
and 1980s and seeing clients--
normal astrologer things.

00:02:26.580 --> 00:02:30.110 align:middle line:84%
And I just kept noticing
that certain transits had

00:02:30.110 --> 00:02:32.130 align:middle line:84%
such a huge influence
on people's lives,

00:02:32.130 --> 00:02:35.780 align:middle line:84%
particularly Saturn transits,
and Uranus opposite Uranus,

00:02:35.780 --> 00:02:37.740 align:middle line:90%
which occurs at midlife crisis.

00:02:37.740 --> 00:02:40.320 align:middle line:84%
And then also I've written
another book about Chiron.

00:02:40.320 --> 00:02:43.310 align:middle line:84%
So I was watching for transits
of Chiron pretty carefully.

00:02:43.310 --> 00:02:47.960 align:middle line:84%
And so when I came
to the late 1980s,

00:02:47.960 --> 00:02:50.126 align:middle line:84%
I realized that
something else was

00:02:50.126 --> 00:02:51.875 align:middle line:84%
going on with these
transits, particularly

00:02:51.875 --> 00:02:54.220 align:middle line:90%
Uranus opposite Uranus.

00:02:54.220 --> 00:02:57.010 align:middle line:84%
And during that period of time
when I was reading charts,

00:02:57.010 --> 00:02:59.350 align:middle line:84%
I also was watching
out for Kundalini

00:02:59.350 --> 00:03:02.220 align:middle line:84%
rising, because for those of
us working in healing arts,

00:03:02.220 --> 00:03:04.450 align:middle line:84%
we pay very close
attention to what's

00:03:04.450 --> 00:03:06.920 align:middle line:84%
going on with
Kundalini energy, which

00:03:06.920 --> 00:03:09.090 align:middle line:84%
is the fire energy
in our bodies.

00:03:09.090 --> 00:03:11.560 align:middle line:84%
Because that's what heals
us and that's what helps us

00:03:11.560 --> 00:03:13.540 align:middle line:90%
transform our consciousness.

00:03:13.540 --> 00:03:16.760 align:middle line:84%
So I started noticing that
at midlife crisis, somewhere

00:03:16.760 --> 00:03:19.610 align:middle line:84%
between 38 and 44,
all of my clients

00:03:19.610 --> 00:03:22.020 align:middle line:84%
were showing signs
of Kundalini rising.

00:03:22.020 --> 00:03:24.280 align:middle line:84%
And yet, in the typical
Eastern tradition,

00:03:24.280 --> 00:03:26.920 align:middle line:84%
this only occurs if you do
certain kinds of breathing

00:03:26.920 --> 00:03:30.080 align:middle line:84%
exercises and meditations
and things like that.

00:03:30.080 --> 00:03:32.990 align:middle line:84%
So I decided that
midlife crisis was

00:03:32.990 --> 00:03:34.940 align:middle line:84%
being triggered by
Kundalini rising.

00:03:34.940 --> 00:03:37.675 align:middle line:84%
And then I started watching
for the exact points

00:03:37.675 --> 00:03:40.990 align:middle line:84%
of Uranus opposite Uranus,
which occur three times.

00:03:40.990 --> 00:03:43.460 align:middle line:84%
And people were having
massive Kundalini risings

00:03:43.460 --> 00:03:46.070 align:middle line:84%
at the very first point
of Uranus opposite Uranus.

00:03:46.070 --> 00:03:47.549 align:middle line:90%
Spiritual emergency.

00:03:47.549 --> 00:03:48.090 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: OK.

00:03:48.090 --> 00:03:49.130 align:middle line:84%
Well, most people
would say, yeah,

00:03:49.130 --> 00:03:51.100 align:middle line:84%
I certainly had an
emotional emergency.

00:03:51.100 --> 00:03:52.510 align:middle line:90%
Everyone can relate to that.

00:03:52.510 --> 00:03:54.440 align:middle line:84%
But because of how
we've been conditioned

00:03:54.440 --> 00:03:57.300 align:middle line:84%
when it comes to Kundalini, we
think oh, my god, this blowout

00:03:57.300 --> 00:03:57.980 align:middle line:90%
experience.

00:03:57.980 --> 00:03:59.630 align:middle line:90%
It travels up the spine.

00:03:59.630 --> 00:04:00.310 align:middle line:90%
I'm enlightened.

00:04:00.310 --> 00:04:01.210 align:middle line:90%
I see everything.

00:04:01.210 --> 00:04:02.840 align:middle line:90%
I can travel out of my body.

00:04:02.840 --> 00:04:06.060 align:middle line:84%
What do you mean when you're
talking about these Kundalini

00:04:06.060 --> 00:04:06.690 align:middle line:90%
experiences?

00:04:06.690 --> 00:04:08.773 align:middle line:84%
>>CLOW: I'm actually talking
about the same thing.

00:04:08.773 --> 00:04:11.590 align:middle line:84%
But what happens within our
chakra systems, the lower

00:04:11.590 --> 00:04:15.420 align:middle line:84%
chakras, root chakras, sacral
chakra, and the solar plexus

00:04:15.420 --> 00:04:17.240 align:middle line:84%
chakra, and then
up into the heart

00:04:17.240 --> 00:04:18.920 align:middle line:84%
is when we reach
that point where

00:04:18.920 --> 00:04:22.350 align:middle line:84%
that larger level of Ku--
Kundalini's always rising

00:04:22.350 --> 00:04:23.480 align:middle line:90%
or we wouldn't be alive.

00:04:23.480 --> 00:04:25.790 align:middle line:84%
But when it comes to
that massive rising,

00:04:25.790 --> 00:04:28.850 align:middle line:84%
it's going to go into whatever
chakra is kind of stuck

00:04:28.850 --> 00:04:32.330 align:middle line:84%
and filled with contents
that need to be cleared.

00:04:32.330 --> 00:04:35.100 align:middle line:84%
And usually at midlife
crisis it goes right

00:04:35.100 --> 00:04:38.220 align:middle line:84%
into the solar
plexus, which forces

00:04:38.220 --> 00:04:40.570 align:middle line:84%
you to deal with
anger and conflict.

00:04:40.570 --> 00:04:43.900 align:middle line:84%
And so midlife crisis is
often a relational crisis

00:04:43.900 --> 00:04:47.050 align:middle line:84%
because we start having
difficulty with our partners

00:04:47.050 --> 00:04:48.360 align:middle line:90%
at that point in time.

00:04:48.360 --> 00:04:50.300 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: The 30s
are a hard decade.

00:04:50.300 --> 00:04:52.525 align:middle line:84%
I found that was
a difficult-- It

00:04:52.525 --> 00:04:54.420 align:middle line:84%
was a wonderful
decade in that that's

00:04:54.420 --> 00:04:56.340 align:middle line:84%
when I had my
beautiful son, which

00:04:56.340 --> 00:04:58.980 align:middle line:84%
was the most wonderful thing
I did in this lifetime.

00:04:58.980 --> 00:05:00.560 align:middle line:84%
But at the same
time, I just found

00:05:00.560 --> 00:05:03.100 align:middle line:84%
it a very challenging
decade in terms

00:05:03.100 --> 00:05:06.390 align:middle line:84%
of navigating to find
out who and what you are.

00:05:06.390 --> 00:05:09.460 align:middle line:84%
And as I talk to people, it
seems the 30s, for many people,

00:05:09.460 --> 00:05:10.150 align:middle line:90%
is difficult.

00:05:10.150 --> 00:05:11.691 align:middle line:84%
>>CLOW: Yeah, that's
absolutely true.

00:05:11.691 --> 00:05:14.310 align:middle line:84%
So the first transit that
the book is working with

00:05:14.310 --> 00:05:17.070 align:middle line:84%
is Saturn return, which
occurs for all of us

00:05:17.070 --> 00:05:19.200 align:middle line:90%
when we're 29 to 30 years old.

00:05:19.200 --> 00:05:21.280 align:middle line:84%
And at that point,
we make a change

00:05:21.280 --> 00:05:24.590 align:middle line:84%
in our physical matrix, which
would be jobs or marriages

00:05:24.590 --> 00:05:26.270 align:middle line:90%
or having a child or whatever.

00:05:26.270 --> 00:05:28.370 align:middle line:84%
And if you watch people
closely, everybody

00:05:28.370 --> 00:05:30.710 align:middle line:84%
makes a major change
at age 29 to 30.

00:05:30.710 --> 00:05:32.760 align:middle line:84%
You just can't find
anybody who doesn't.

00:05:32.760 --> 00:05:35.360 align:middle line:84%
But as soon as they
make that major change

00:05:35.360 --> 00:05:38.430 align:middle line:84%
and shift their reality at
that physical plane level,

00:05:38.430 --> 00:05:41.320 align:middle line:84%
then they start processing
themselves emotionally.

00:05:41.320 --> 00:05:43.800 align:middle line:84%
And at this point
in time for humans,

00:05:43.800 --> 00:05:46.470 align:middle line:84%
the most difficult part
of our learning process

00:05:46.470 --> 00:05:48.150 align:middle line:90%
is definitely emotional.

00:05:48.150 --> 00:05:49.930 align:middle line:84%
So all the way through
the 30s, actually

00:05:49.930 --> 00:05:53.090 align:middle line:84%
were having a rocky
emotional journey,

00:05:53.090 --> 00:05:55.480 align:middle line:84%
because when we come up
to midlife crisis, then

00:05:55.480 --> 00:05:57.744 align:middle line:84%
we're going to have
an emotional crisis.

00:05:57.744 --> 00:05:58.660 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Interesting.

00:05:58.660 --> 00:06:02.070 align:middle line:84%
OK, now let's go back
for just a moment.

00:06:02.070 --> 00:06:06.090 align:middle line:84%
You wrote a lot of this
back in the original book,

00:06:06.090 --> 00:06:08.856 align:middle line:90%
and what happened?

00:06:08.856 --> 00:06:10.980 align:middle line:84%
What happened by way of
your own understanding that

00:06:10.980 --> 00:06:13.386 align:middle line:84%
created the need to
rewrite and expand?

00:06:13.386 --> 00:06:15.010 align:middle line:84%
>>CLOW: Well, Regina,
actually the book

00:06:15.010 --> 00:06:16.840 align:middle line:84%
went through three
revisions, but this

00:06:16.840 --> 00:06:19.490 align:middle line:84%
is a major rewrite at
this point in time,

00:06:19.490 --> 00:06:22.800 align:middle line:84%
because when I floated this
idea back in the early '90s,

00:06:22.800 --> 00:06:26.010 align:middle line:84%
it was a hypothesis that
I wanted other astrologers

00:06:26.010 --> 00:06:27.940 align:middle line:84%
to test, and I
wanted readers to see

00:06:27.940 --> 00:06:29.730 align:middle line:84%
if this fit with
their experience.

00:06:29.730 --> 00:06:33.170 align:middle line:84%
So after 25 years approximately,
it's not a hypothesis.

00:06:33.170 --> 00:06:34.740 align:middle line:90%
It's a theory now.

00:06:34.740 --> 00:06:37.110 align:middle line:84%
And I think it's an
extremely accurate theory

00:06:37.110 --> 00:06:38.780 align:middle line:90%
and a very important one.

00:06:38.780 --> 00:06:42.530 align:middle line:84%
Because you can anticipate
these changes in your life,

00:06:42.530 --> 00:06:43.420 align:middle line:90%
first of all.

00:06:43.420 --> 00:06:45.822 align:middle line:84%
And then secondly, you can
understand the process that's

00:06:45.822 --> 00:06:47.780 align:middle line:84%
involved, because if you
didn't understand what

00:06:47.780 --> 00:06:50.870 align:middle line:84%
the process was, you wouldn't
be able to really take

00:06:50.870 --> 00:06:52.660 align:middle line:84%
advantage of it or
use it very easily.

00:06:52.660 --> 00:06:54.150 align:middle line:84%
And so once you
start to understand

00:06:54.150 --> 00:06:56.840 align:middle line:84%
that energy is
actually pushing--

00:06:56.840 --> 00:06:59.200 align:middle line:84%
I call it the solar
growth theory.

00:06:59.200 --> 00:07:01.900 align:middle line:84%
The idea that we, as
humans, are plants,

00:07:01.900 --> 00:07:03.860 align:middle line:84%
and that we are growing
through these stages

00:07:03.860 --> 00:07:06.120 align:middle line:84%
of life being fed by
the energy from the Sun.

00:07:06.120 --> 00:07:08.880 align:middle line:84%
I actually think that this
is a biological process.

00:07:08.880 --> 00:07:11.300 align:middle line:84%
So at this point, it's really
a strong theory and not

00:07:11.300 --> 00:07:14.580 align:middle line:84%
just an idea, not
just a hypothesis.

00:07:14.580 --> 00:07:16.140 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: You have
a lovely forward

00:07:16.140 --> 00:07:17.809 align:middle line:84%
in the book by Dr.
Richard Gerber.

00:07:17.809 --> 00:07:18.350 align:middle line:90%
>>CLOW: Yeah.

00:07:18.350 --> 00:07:20.920 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And I
lifted a little bit

00:07:20.920 --> 00:07:22.690 align:middle line:84%
of what he said,
because I thought

00:07:22.690 --> 00:07:25.710 align:middle line:84%
it was so eloquently put
it in such a compact space,

00:07:25.710 --> 00:07:27.830 align:middle line:84%
that I thought it worth
reading at this time,

00:07:27.830 --> 00:07:33.930 align:middle line:84%
so people can understand this
is not a science of belief,

00:07:33.930 --> 00:07:34.651 align:middle line:90%
so to speak.

00:07:34.651 --> 00:07:36.150 align:middle line:84%
He's saying, "When
the planets reach

00:07:36.150 --> 00:07:39.580 align:middle line:84%
the particular geometric
position relative to Earth that

00:07:39.580 --> 00:07:41.690 align:middle line:84%
is the same as the
birth time, there

00:07:41.690 --> 00:07:45.030 align:middle line:84%
is a reactivation of the
same magnetic pattern

00:07:45.030 --> 00:07:48.770 align:middle line:84%
in the resonating chakra,
causing a cascading energy

00:07:48.770 --> 00:07:53.880 align:middle line:84%
transfer from an astral, to the
etheric, down to the physical."

00:07:53.880 --> 00:07:56.034 align:middle line:84%
Now, that's a lot
in one sentence.

00:07:56.034 --> 00:07:56.575 align:middle line:90%
>>CLOW: Yeah.

00:07:56.575 --> 00:07:58.470 align:middle line:84%
That whole introduction
is amazing.

00:07:58.470 --> 00:08:00.490 align:middle line:84%
And when he first--
Richard Gerber, of course,

00:08:00.490 --> 00:08:02.220 align:middle line:84%
is the author of
"Vibrational Medicine."

00:08:02.220 --> 00:08:02.590 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:08:02.590 --> 00:08:04.923 align:middle line:84%
>>CLOW: He's definitely one
of the most important people

00:08:04.923 --> 00:08:07.774 align:middle line:84%
in the field of understanding
complementary medicine.

00:08:07.774 --> 00:08:09.190 align:middle line:84%
And Richard's not
with us anymore.

00:08:09.190 --> 00:08:11.640 align:middle line:84%
He died five or six years
ago at a very young age,

00:08:11.640 --> 00:08:12.680 align:middle line:90%
unfortunately.

00:08:12.680 --> 00:08:15.990 align:middle line:84%
And the introduction
is worth the price

00:08:15.990 --> 00:08:17.200 align:middle line:90%
of the book, what he--

00:08:17.200 --> 00:08:17.340 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: It was so well done.

00:08:17.340 --> 00:08:20.040 align:middle line:84%
>>CLOW: His proof of astrology
is just absolutely stunning.

00:08:20.040 --> 00:08:22.850 align:middle line:84%
So thank you for bringing
that up because in the past,

00:08:22.850 --> 00:08:24.004 align:middle line:90%
nobody could even read it.

00:08:24.004 --> 00:08:25.670 align:middle line:84%
I had to read it about
10 times before I

00:08:25.670 --> 00:08:27.410 align:middle line:84%
could understand
the introduction.

00:08:27.410 --> 00:08:29.370 align:middle line:84%
But what's interesting
is at this point,

00:08:29.370 --> 00:08:31.279 align:middle line:84%
you can understand it
now when you read it.

00:08:31.279 --> 00:08:31.820 align:middle line:90%
It's a real--

00:08:31.820 --> 00:08:32.819 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Sitting there.

00:08:32.819 --> 00:08:34.992 align:middle line:84%
>>CLOW: It's a real story
of how far we've come.

00:08:34.992 --> 00:08:35.950 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: It really is.

00:08:35.950 --> 00:08:40.299 align:middle line:84%
Because just the use of the term
"subtle bodies" 30 years ago

00:08:40.299 --> 00:08:41.755 align:middle line:90%
was not well understood at all.

00:08:41.755 --> 00:08:42.630 align:middle line:90%
>>CLOW: That's right.

00:08:42.630 --> 00:08:44.570 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And so
then as he says--

00:08:44.570 --> 00:08:48.740 align:middle line:84%
I love this-- "cascading from
the astral, to the etheric,

00:08:48.740 --> 00:08:49.407 align:middle line:90%
to the physical.

00:08:49.407 --> 00:08:50.448 align:middle line:90%
>>CLOW: Isn't that great.

00:08:50.448 --> 00:08:52.430 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So can you
expand on that for us

00:08:52.430 --> 00:08:54.700 align:middle line:90%
about how that matrix works?

00:08:54.700 --> 00:08:56.660 align:middle line:84%
>>CLOW: Now, this gets
into multi-dimensional

00:08:56.660 --> 00:08:57.110 align:middle line:90%
consciousness.

00:08:57.110 --> 00:08:58.310 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Yes, but that's
why we're doing this.

00:08:58.310 --> 00:08:58.820 align:middle line:90%
>>CLOW: That's right.

00:08:58.820 --> 00:08:59.920 align:middle line:90%
We're here for that.

00:08:59.920 --> 00:09:02.470 align:middle line:84%
And the issue, as
I understand it,

00:09:02.470 --> 00:09:05.940 align:middle line:84%
would be that when we're ready
at a certain point, which

00:09:05.940 --> 00:09:09.590 align:middle line:84%
has to do with the astrological
transits, then what can happen

00:09:09.590 --> 00:09:12.870 align:middle line:84%
is this breakthrough from
higher realms of consciousness

00:09:12.870 --> 00:09:14.880 align:middle line:84%
and higher dimensions
of consciousness

00:09:14.880 --> 00:09:18.660 align:middle line:84%
can come into our
field and can influence

00:09:18.660 --> 00:09:21.710 align:middle line:84%
us to go to very high
levels of consciousness.

00:09:21.710 --> 00:09:23.940 align:middle line:84%
And so, when you think about
it from this perspective

00:09:23.940 --> 00:09:26.500 align:middle line:84%
and what Dr. Gerber
had to say about it,

00:09:26.500 --> 00:09:28.320 align:middle line:90%
it's not just Kundalini rising.

00:09:28.320 --> 00:09:30.620 align:middle line:84%
It's also an opening
to higher dimensions.

00:09:30.620 --> 00:09:33.400 align:middle line:84%
Now, of course, in ancient
spiritual traditions,

00:09:33.400 --> 00:09:35.180 align:middle line:84%
they've always
thought of Kundalini

00:09:35.180 --> 00:09:37.960 align:middle line:84%
rising as an open to
spiritual consciousness.

00:09:37.960 --> 00:09:41.780 align:middle line:84%
So it's a process of energy
just going in two directions

00:09:41.780 --> 00:09:43.293 align:middle line:90%
from within us.

00:09:43.293 --> 00:09:45.040 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Well, he's
talking about it

00:09:45.040 --> 00:09:46.635 align:middle line:90%
originating in the astral plane.

00:09:46.635 --> 00:09:49.440 align:middle line:84%
But would you say that
it's actually starting it

00:09:49.440 --> 00:09:53.374 align:middle line:84%
with an even finer
higher dimensional--

00:09:53.374 --> 00:09:54.040 align:middle line:90%
>>CLOW: I would.

00:09:54.040 --> 00:09:55.379 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: --aspects of ourself.

00:09:55.379 --> 00:09:57.170 align:middle line:84%
Kind of then processing
through the astral?

00:09:57.170 --> 00:09:58.040 align:middle line:90%
>>CLOW: Yeah, I would.

00:09:58.040 --> 00:10:00.120 align:middle line:84%
And everything has to
process through the astral.

00:10:00.120 --> 00:10:01.630 align:middle line:84%
That's the thing
about being human.

00:10:01.630 --> 00:10:04.400 align:middle line:84%
Because for me in my
system, the astral plane

00:10:04.400 --> 00:10:07.580 align:middle line:84%
is basically a fourth
dimensional plane of existence.

00:10:07.580 --> 00:10:10.810 align:middle line:84%
And then we're in solid
in the third dimension

00:10:10.810 --> 00:10:12.260 align:middle line:90%
in space and time.

00:10:12.260 --> 00:10:15.320 align:middle line:84%
And so what's actually
being played with here

00:10:15.320 --> 00:10:17.740 align:middle line:84%
would be the idea that
in any given realm

00:10:17.740 --> 00:10:19.700 align:middle line:84%
there are different
kinds of timelines,

00:10:19.700 --> 00:10:22.380 align:middle line:84%
and we'll go beyond
that because-- I'll

00:10:22.380 --> 00:10:24.790 align:middle line:84%
let that one go because
it's so complicated.

00:10:24.790 --> 00:10:27.800 align:middle line:84%
But we're dealing with the
actual timelines of the planet

00:10:27.800 --> 00:10:31.250 align:middle line:84%
Saturn, which causes
formation and structure.

00:10:31.250 --> 00:10:33.810 align:middle line:84%
And then we're dealing with
the timelines of Uranus,

00:10:33.810 --> 00:10:35.890 align:middle line:90%
which triggers transformation.

00:10:35.890 --> 00:10:38.590 align:middle line:84%
And so what happens at that
midlife crisis point is

00:10:38.590 --> 00:10:41.390 align:middle line:84%
those timelines on
Uranus, in relationship

00:10:41.390 --> 00:10:44.190 align:middle line:84%
to our consciousness
here, all come together

00:10:44.190 --> 00:10:47.750 align:middle line:84%
and come into a confluence
at that point in time.

00:10:47.750 --> 00:10:54.910 align:middle line:84%
And this fall, now that it's a
theory instead of a hypothesis,

00:10:54.910 --> 00:10:56.990 align:middle line:84%
we went out and
taught three classes

00:10:56.990 --> 00:10:59.660 align:middle line:84%
that were based on
these principles.

00:10:59.660 --> 00:11:03.100 align:middle line:84%
What we did is we set up a
question and answer thing

00:11:03.100 --> 00:11:07.400 align:middle line:84%
on Saturn return, Uranus
opposite Uranus, and then

00:11:07.400 --> 00:11:08.990 align:middle line:90%
Chiron return.

00:11:08.990 --> 00:11:11.330 align:middle line:84%
And then I explained
to the students

00:11:11.330 --> 00:11:13.120 align:middle line:84%
the positive and
negative aspects

00:11:13.120 --> 00:11:14.670 align:middle line:84%
of any given decision
that you will

00:11:14.670 --> 00:11:16.390 align:middle line:90%
make at that point in time.

00:11:16.390 --> 00:11:19.920 align:middle line:84%
And the audience was just--
I've never really seen

00:11:19.920 --> 00:11:25.000 align:middle line:84%
so much excitement, because it's
really being proven by people.

00:11:25.000 --> 00:11:27.840 align:middle line:84%
If they go back and look at
what happened at midlife crisis,

00:11:27.840 --> 00:11:30.095 align:middle line:84%
they will see the
positive and negative--

00:11:30.095 --> 00:11:31.470 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Well,
you had thousands

00:11:31.470 --> 00:11:33.650 align:middle line:90%
of validations on your theory.

00:11:33.650 --> 00:11:34.210 align:middle line:90%
>>CLOW: Yeah.

00:11:34.210 --> 00:11:34.480 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:11:34.480 --> 00:11:35.030 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:11:35.030 --> 00:11:36.080 align:middle line:90%
I mean on your hypothesis.

00:11:36.080 --> 00:11:36.621 align:middle line:90%
>>CLOW: Yeah.

00:11:36.621 --> 00:11:38.680 align:middle line:84%
But the reason it's
so important is now

00:11:38.680 --> 00:11:40.610 align:middle line:84%
people can start to
think, well, what's

00:11:40.610 --> 00:11:44.690 align:middle line:84%
positive and negative here,
number one, at the time.

00:11:44.690 --> 00:11:46.710 align:middle line:84%
But even more
importantly, people

00:11:46.710 --> 00:11:50.290 align:middle line:84%
seem to be able to clear
away negative residue

00:11:50.290 --> 00:11:52.270 align:middle line:84%
once they understand
what happened.

00:11:52.270 --> 00:11:54.990 align:middle line:84%
So like if a person had
a really nasty divorce

00:11:54.990 --> 00:11:58.210 align:middle line:84%
at midlife crisis, like one of
these tragic situations where

00:11:58.210 --> 00:11:59.960 align:middle line:84%
they just can't hold
the marriage together

00:11:59.960 --> 00:12:02.260 align:middle line:84%
and they bust it all up,
and then three years later

00:12:02.260 --> 00:12:03.315 align:middle line:90%
wish they hadn't done it.

00:12:03.315 --> 00:12:05.065 align:middle line:84%
Things like that,
because these are very--

00:12:05.065 --> 00:12:05.085 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:12:05.085 --> 00:12:05.130 align:middle line:90%
And it does happen.

00:12:05.130 --> 00:12:06.450 align:middle line:90%
>>CLOW: --difficult things.

00:12:06.450 --> 00:12:10.180 align:middle line:84%
We advise, as astrologers, we
advise people to hang together

00:12:10.180 --> 00:12:12.880 align:middle line:84%
as best they can through midlife
crisis if they've been married

00:12:12.880 --> 00:12:14.460 align:middle line:84%
for quite a while,
because they may

00:12:14.460 --> 00:12:16.980 align:middle line:84%
be letting go of something
that's really valuable to them.

00:12:16.980 --> 00:12:20.862 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Well and also,
it has to do with-- we'll

00:12:20.862 --> 00:12:22.320 align:middle line:84%
digress by saying
this-- but it has

00:12:22.320 --> 00:12:24.270 align:middle line:84%
to do with the age
groups each one are in.

00:12:24.270 --> 00:12:24.770 align:middle line:90%
>>CLOW: Yes.

00:12:24.770 --> 00:12:26.880 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: If they're both
in a similar age group

00:12:26.880 --> 00:12:29.290 align:middle line:84%
going through a similar
dynamic together,

00:12:29.290 --> 00:12:32.630 align:middle line:84%
it can be more challenging,
or maybe even easier

00:12:32.630 --> 00:12:34.320 align:middle line:84%
by way of cutting
each other slack,

00:12:34.320 --> 00:12:37.810 align:middle line:84%
than if you're 10 or 15
years apart, for example.

00:12:37.810 --> 00:12:39.280 align:middle line:84%
But I want to ask
one more question

00:12:39.280 --> 00:12:41.160 align:middle line:84%
before we get off
this multi-dimension.

00:12:41.160 --> 00:12:45.730 align:middle line:84%
We're not getting off it, but--
The notion of spirit or soul,

00:12:45.730 --> 00:12:48.950 align:middle line:84%
and the fine, fine dimension
in which it resides

00:12:48.950 --> 00:12:53.060 align:middle line:84%
has to have made choices
and decisions on behalf

00:12:53.060 --> 00:12:56.320 align:middle line:84%
of what was to be your
incarnation, to choose

00:12:56.320 --> 00:12:59.095 align:middle line:84%
these various influences to
be born under, I would assume.

00:12:59.095 --> 00:12:59.719 align:middle line:90%
>>CLOW: Um-hmm.

00:12:59.719 --> 00:13:01.170 align:middle line:90%
I think that's true, yeah.

00:13:01.170 --> 00:13:02.570 align:middle line:90%
Yeah, I do think so.

00:13:02.570 --> 00:13:04.870 align:middle line:84%
I mean I really believe
Dr. Wayne Newton's "Journey

00:13:04.870 --> 00:13:08.480 align:middle line:84%
of Souls" is right on about
the inner life and the process

00:13:08.480 --> 00:13:10.440 align:middle line:84%
that we go through to
select an incarnation.

00:13:10.440 --> 00:13:11.470 align:middle line:90%
I think that's true.

00:13:11.470 --> 00:13:13.420 align:middle line:84%
I think we select our
astrological chart.

00:13:13.420 --> 00:13:14.590 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Yes, that's
what I'm getting to.

00:13:14.590 --> 00:13:16.860 align:middle line:84%
>>CLOW: Because our astrological
chart, that moment in time,

00:13:16.860 --> 00:13:18.318 align:middle line:84%
and watch-- it's
really interesting

00:13:18.318 --> 00:13:19.770 align:middle line:90%
to watch when babies come in.

00:13:19.770 --> 00:13:25.066 align:middle line:84%
Like my granddaughter was born
at dawn on December 21, 2012,

00:13:25.066 --> 00:13:26.690 align:middle line:84%
at the exact end of
the Mayan calendar.

00:13:26.690 --> 00:13:28.200 align:middle line:90%
It's incredible, you know.

00:13:28.200 --> 00:13:28.780 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: No accident there.

00:13:28.780 --> 00:13:29.116 align:middle line:90%
>>CLOW: Yeah, I know.

00:13:29.116 --> 00:13:29.949 align:middle line:90%
It's really amazing.

00:13:29.949 --> 00:13:32.720 align:middle line:84%
And so we do choose to come
in at a certain point in time

00:13:32.720 --> 00:13:35.300 align:middle line:84%
in order to face challenges
that our soul has

00:13:35.300 --> 00:13:36.150 align:middle line:90%
chosen to have as--

00:13:36.150 --> 00:13:37.525 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And also
opportunities.

00:13:37.525 --> 00:13:39.290 align:middle line:84%
>>CLOW: Oh, absolutely
opportunities.

00:13:39.290 --> 00:13:42.310 align:middle line:84%
And so where astrology is
useful is-- First of all,

00:13:42.310 --> 00:13:43.732 align:middle line:84%
the best thing
about astrology is

00:13:43.732 --> 00:13:45.940 align:middle line:84%
it'll tell you when something's
going to be finished.

00:13:45.940 --> 00:13:48.148 align:middle line:84%
Because people go to
astrologers because everything's

00:13:48.148 --> 00:13:50.150 align:middle line:90%
a mess, frequently.

00:13:50.150 --> 00:13:52.490 align:middle line:84%
But also, you can
actually use astrology

00:13:52.490 --> 00:13:55.080 align:middle line:84%
in order to anticipate
a particular phase,

00:13:55.080 --> 00:13:57.600 align:middle line:84%
and then try to work
on how to use it

00:13:57.600 --> 00:13:58.844 align:middle line:90%
in the best possible way.

00:13:58.844 --> 00:14:00.260 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: OK, now
this is not part

00:14:00.260 --> 00:14:01.920 align:middle line:84%
of what you're
writing about here.

00:14:01.920 --> 00:14:04.850 align:middle line:84%
But do you feel that
astrocartography

00:14:04.850 --> 00:14:07.180 align:middle line:84%
has the same kind of
value where you're

00:14:07.180 --> 00:14:10.540 align:middle line:84%
picking a location
on the planet?

00:14:10.540 --> 00:14:14.760 align:middle line:84%
Longitudinally and latitudinally
you're choosing this location,

00:14:14.760 --> 00:14:16.940 align:middle line:90%
and you're choosing this time.

00:14:16.940 --> 00:14:18.090 align:middle line:90%
>>CLOW: I know it does--

00:14:18.090 --> 00:14:18.910 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: And so--

00:14:18.910 --> 00:14:20.090 align:middle line:90%
>>CLOW: It definitely does.

00:14:20.090 --> 00:14:22.630 align:middle line:84%
Because it's all
space time, and it's

00:14:22.630 --> 00:14:24.520 align:middle line:90%
all related to place and time.

00:14:24.520 --> 00:14:26.180 align:middle line:84%
And so you have
a certain dynamic

00:14:26.180 --> 00:14:29.160 align:middle line:84%
in your astrological chart,
and it can work better

00:14:29.160 --> 00:14:31.150 align:middle line:90%
in one place than another place.

00:14:31.150 --> 00:14:32.660 align:middle line:90%
Astrocartography really works.

00:14:32.660 --> 00:14:34.340 align:middle line:84%
I don't do it, but
it really works.

00:14:34.340 --> 00:14:34.840 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: It does.

00:14:34.840 --> 00:14:36.256 align:middle line:84%
And then it would
have a same kind

00:14:36.256 --> 00:14:38.265 align:middle line:84%
of progressive
aspect to it as well.

00:14:38.265 --> 00:14:39.390 align:middle line:90%
>>CLOW: Yeah, that's right.

00:14:39.390 --> 00:14:40.973 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: --as you
go through life, as

00:14:40.973 --> 00:14:43.796 align:middle line:84%
to where your best position for
this or best position for that.

00:14:43.796 --> 00:14:45.170 align:middle line:84%
I just bring it
up because that's

00:14:45.170 --> 00:14:47.710 align:middle line:84%
something I think that's
complementary to a lot of this.

00:14:47.710 --> 00:14:50.300 align:middle line:84%
When people are like I can't
stand this place anymore

00:14:50.300 --> 00:14:52.320 align:middle line:84%
and it comes up in
their crises, maybe it's

00:14:52.320 --> 00:14:54.350 align:middle line:84%
also time to pull
up stakes and move.

00:14:54.350 --> 00:14:55.130 align:middle line:90%
>>CLOW: Yes.

00:14:55.130 --> 00:14:56.265 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: That
could be part of it.

00:14:56.265 --> 00:14:56.620 align:middle line:90%
>>CLOW: Definitely.

00:14:56.620 --> 00:14:57.990 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And so
it's worth exploring

00:14:57.990 --> 00:15:00.250 align:middle line:84%
if you can find a good-- hard
to find a good astrocartography

00:15:00.250 --> 00:15:00.958 align:middle line:90%
psych these days.

00:15:00.958 --> 00:15:03.280 align:middle line:84%
>>CLOW: Actually, the online
service that sends out-- I

00:15:03.280 --> 00:15:04.738 align:middle line:84%
can't tell you who
it is-- but just

00:15:04.738 --> 00:15:07.690 align:middle line:84%
sends out the
astrocartographical map,

00:15:07.690 --> 00:15:08.999 align:middle line:90%
and the analysis is very good.

00:15:08.999 --> 00:15:09.790 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: OK, good.

00:15:09.790 --> 00:15:12.380 align:middle line:84%
I just bring it up because it's
just another element in that.

00:15:12.380 --> 00:15:15.290 align:middle line:84%
So let's start out with
Saturn, and then we'll

00:15:15.290 --> 00:15:17.120 align:middle line:90%
go to Uranus, and then Chiron.

00:15:17.120 --> 00:15:19.470 align:middle line:84%
I just find what you wrote
about Chiron fascinating.

00:15:19.470 --> 00:15:22.160 align:middle line:84%
But let's talk about
the three stages

00:15:22.160 --> 00:15:25.690 align:middle line:84%
of what Saturn does for us at
the first return, the second.

00:15:25.690 --> 00:15:28.930 align:middle line:84%
And then after the
second, what happens?

00:15:28.930 --> 00:15:30.780 align:middle line:84%
I mean surely it's
returning again,

00:15:30.780 --> 00:15:32.860 align:middle line:84%
but we don't hear
much about that phase.

00:15:32.860 --> 00:15:35.730 align:middle line:84%
>>CLOW: Well, the first
Saturn return is at age 29,

00:15:35.730 --> 00:15:37.630 align:middle line:84%
and people start
feeling this building

00:15:37.630 --> 00:15:39.215 align:middle line:90%
pressure when they're 27, 28.

00:15:39.215 --> 00:15:40.970 align:middle line:84%
They have the sense
of destiny and there's

00:15:40.970 --> 00:15:42.350 align:middle line:90%
something they need to do.

00:15:42.350 --> 00:15:44.790 align:middle line:84%
And they also are very
bothered usually by things

00:15:44.790 --> 00:15:46.130 align:middle line:90%
that they have to let go of.

00:15:46.130 --> 00:15:49.130 align:middle line:84%
And they're being pushed into
a major decision point in order

00:15:49.130 --> 00:15:50.040 align:middle line:90%
to change something.

00:15:50.040 --> 00:15:53.110 align:middle line:84%
Their work, or have a child, or
get a divorce, or get married,

00:15:53.110 --> 00:15:55.300 align:middle line:84%
or whatever-- Many
different things can

00:15:55.300 --> 00:15:56.570 align:middle line:90%
happen at this point.

00:15:56.570 --> 00:15:58.920 align:middle line:84%
And so that's what happens
with the first Saturn return.

00:15:58.920 --> 00:16:00.740 align:middle line:84%
And then we go
through the transits

00:16:00.740 --> 00:16:03.630 align:middle line:84%
of midlife crisis and
Chiron return after that.

00:16:03.630 --> 00:16:07.990 align:middle line:84%
Then we get another Saturn
return at age 58, 59.

00:16:07.990 --> 00:16:10.990 align:middle line:84%
And that's a great transit,
because you've already

00:16:10.990 --> 00:16:12.820 align:middle line:90%
lived another 29 or 30 years.

00:16:12.820 --> 00:16:15.750 align:middle line:84%
You've already gone through
all this transformation and all

00:16:15.750 --> 00:16:17.400 align:middle line:90%
these decisions in your life.

00:16:17.400 --> 00:16:20.680 align:middle line:84%
And so second Saturn
return is the time

00:16:20.680 --> 00:16:22.370 align:middle line:84%
to decide what you
really want to do

00:16:22.370 --> 00:16:23.860 align:middle line:90%
for the rest of your life.

00:16:23.860 --> 00:16:25.750 align:middle line:84%
Because your third
Saturn return is

00:16:25.750 --> 00:16:28.400 align:middle line:84%
going to come when you're
around 87 or 88 years old.

00:16:28.400 --> 00:16:31.520 align:middle line:84%
But that second Saturn return
is a really, really big one,

00:16:31.520 --> 00:16:34.030 align:middle line:84%
because that's where you can
really consciously choose

00:16:34.030 --> 00:16:35.260 align:middle line:90%
what you'd like to do.

00:16:35.260 --> 00:16:38.780 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Now, I have heard
that in some cultures, that's

00:16:38.780 --> 00:16:43.550 align:middle line:84%
the age where people,
men and women both,

00:16:43.550 --> 00:16:45.159 align:middle line:84%
have finished
their childbearing,

00:16:45.159 --> 00:16:47.200 align:middle line:84%
and historically, though
we're living longer now,

00:16:47.200 --> 00:16:49.400 align:middle line:84%
so that's changing,
have finished

00:16:49.400 --> 00:16:52.740 align:middle line:84%
their major productive
years in terms of career,

00:16:52.740 --> 00:16:53.740 align:middle line:90%
classically in the past.

00:16:53.740 --> 00:16:54.130 align:middle line:90%
>>CLOW: Sure.

00:16:54.130 --> 00:16:56.338 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And then at 61
might even change their name

00:16:56.338 --> 00:16:59.270 align:middle line:84%
and then start devoting their
life to the study of themselves

00:16:59.270 --> 00:17:00.379 align:middle line:90%
and the spiritual world.

00:17:00.379 --> 00:17:01.170 align:middle line:90%
>>CLOW: Yeah, sure.

00:17:01.170 --> 00:17:02.580 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So that would
coincide perfectly.

00:17:02.580 --> 00:17:03.790 align:middle line:84%
>>CLOW: And that's that
one person, though.

00:17:03.790 --> 00:17:06.164 align:middle line:84%
Somebody else might have been
spiritual their whole life,

00:17:06.164 --> 00:17:08.690 align:middle line:84%
and when they're 58 they
decide they want to work.

00:17:08.690 --> 00:17:11.290 align:middle line:84%
But what they're going to do --
what you want to do is decide

00:17:11.290 --> 00:17:14.980 align:middle line:84%
what do I want to do from
age 60 to age 90, basically.

00:17:14.980 --> 00:17:18.400 align:middle line:84%
And be careful about that,
because Saturn return

00:17:18.400 --> 00:17:20.396 align:middle line:84%
is so powerful,
that if you really

00:17:20.396 --> 00:17:22.020 align:middle line:84%
decide you want to
do something, you're

00:17:22.020 --> 00:17:23.103 align:middle line:90%
going to be able to do it.

00:17:23.103 --> 00:17:25.069 align:middle line:84%
And so you don't want to
miss that opportunity.

00:17:25.069 --> 00:17:25.520 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:17:25.520 --> 00:17:28.070 align:middle line:84%
And you don't want to make an
unwise decision at that point

00:17:28.070 --> 00:17:28.140 align:middle line:90%
either.

00:17:28.140 --> 00:17:28.718 align:middle line:90%
>>CLOW: Yes, that right.

00:17:28.718 --> 00:17:29.259 align:middle line:90%
You want to--

00:17:29.259 --> 00:17:31.840 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Can that cast you
into a bit of a downward spiral

00:17:31.840 --> 00:17:34.820 align:middle line:84%
if you're just reacting and not
choosing wisely at that time

00:17:34.820 --> 00:17:37.342 align:middle line:84%
and squandering that
particular return?

00:17:37.342 --> 00:17:38.050 align:middle line:90%
>>CLOW: It could.

00:17:38.050 --> 00:17:40.764 align:middle line:84%
But generally speaking, that's
a happy transit for people.

00:17:40.764 --> 00:17:41.930 align:middle line:90%
That's a meaningful transit.

00:17:41.930 --> 00:17:43.580 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Well, how come
everyone's so afraid of it?

00:17:43.580 --> 00:17:44.140 align:middle line:90%
Oh--

00:17:44.140 --> 00:17:44.725 align:middle line:90%
>>CLOW: Isn't it funny?

00:17:44.725 --> 00:17:46.225 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: --I'm in
my Saturn return.

00:17:46.225 --> 00:17:49.270 align:middle line:84%
I hear people freaking out
at both ages, 29 and 58.

00:17:49.270 --> 00:17:51.315 align:middle line:84%
>>CLOW: I think Saturn
is a wonderful planet.

00:17:51.315 --> 00:17:52.690 align:middle line:84%
I think If it
weren't for Saturn,

00:17:52.690 --> 00:17:54.890 align:middle line:84%
we wouldn't get off of
our butts and do anything.

00:17:54.890 --> 00:17:56.931 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Let's talk about
that for just a moment

00:17:56.931 --> 00:17:59.220 align:middle line:84%
because a lot of people
are afraid of Saturn.

00:17:59.220 --> 00:18:00.879 align:middle line:84%
Oh, it's going to
make me do something.

00:18:00.879 --> 00:18:02.420 align:middle line:84%
Well, that's only
if you haven't been

00:18:02.420 --> 00:18:03.930 align:middle line:84%
doing what you're
supposed to be doing

00:18:03.930 --> 00:18:05.850 align:middle line:84%
or what your-- from a
soul point of view, what

00:18:05.850 --> 00:18:08.601 align:middle line:84%
has been inspiring you to be
done is not being done, right?

00:18:08.601 --> 00:18:09.476 align:middle line:90%
>>CLOW: Um-hmm, yeah.

00:18:09.476 --> 00:18:11.392 align:middle line:84%
And if people are having
a struggle with that,

00:18:11.392 --> 00:18:13.816 align:middle line:84%
it's a good idea to look
at the nodes of the moon,

00:18:13.816 --> 00:18:15.690 align:middle line:84%
like the North node of
the moon in your chart

00:18:15.690 --> 00:18:18.280 align:middle line:84%
will tell you what your
purpose is in this lifetime,

00:18:18.280 --> 00:18:21.180 align:middle line:84%
and the South node will tell
you what you've already done

00:18:21.180 --> 00:18:22.750 align:middle line:90%
and what you've come from.

00:18:22.750 --> 00:18:26.530 align:middle line:84%
And if you're not getting on
to that North node, purpose

00:18:26.530 --> 00:18:29.580 align:middle line:84%
in this lifetime, by the
time you're 29 or 30,

00:18:29.580 --> 00:18:32.250 align:middle line:84%
you might want to
decide to do it,

00:18:32.250 --> 00:18:35.227 align:middle line:84%
because you're going to float
in your 30s and 40s and 50s.

00:18:35.227 --> 00:18:35.810 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:18:35.810 --> 00:18:38.055 align:middle line:84%
The nodes aren't talked
about often enough.

00:18:38.055 --> 00:18:38.930 align:middle line:90%
>>CLOW: Yeah, I know.

00:18:38.930 --> 00:18:40.680 align:middle line:90%
I start a chart with the nodes.

00:18:40.680 --> 00:18:41.430 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Did you?

00:18:41.430 --> 00:18:43.885 align:middle line:84%
>>CLOW: I always do, because
why is the person there?

00:18:43.885 --> 00:18:44.510 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:18:44.510 --> 00:18:44.650 align:middle line:90%
>>CLOW: You want a soul read.

00:18:44.650 --> 00:18:46.150 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Where
did you come from,

00:18:46.150 --> 00:18:47.755 align:middle line:84%
and what are you
moving toward, right?

00:18:47.755 --> 00:18:48.630 align:middle line:90%
>>CLOW: That's right.

00:18:48.630 --> 00:18:50.444 align:middle line:84%
And the nodes will
give you that reading.

00:18:50.444 --> 00:18:51.360 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Interesting.

00:18:51.360 --> 00:18:53.359 align:middle line:84%
>>CLOW: But the great
thing about Saturn return,

00:18:53.359 --> 00:18:55.880 align:middle line:84%
Regina, is about
95% of people do it.

00:18:55.880 --> 00:18:58.205 align:middle line:84%
Saturn is the
planet of necessity.

00:18:58.205 --> 00:18:59.960 align:middle line:84%
And even if they think
they don't like it

00:18:59.960 --> 00:19:01.626 align:middle line:84%
and they're resisting
it, they'll do it.

00:19:01.626 --> 00:19:02.240 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:19:02.240 --> 00:19:02.630 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

00:19:02.630 --> 00:19:03.360 align:middle line:90%
>>CLOW: Everybody does.

00:19:03.360 --> 00:19:04.435 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Even if it
looks a little awkward,

00:19:04.435 --> 00:19:06.030 align:middle line:84%
ugly in the moment,
it will probably

00:19:06.030 --> 00:19:08.380 align:middle line:84%
smooth out and get you
on the right road anyway.

00:19:08.380 --> 00:19:10.620 align:middle line:84%
It could look like a
car wreck initially.

00:19:10.620 --> 00:19:12.730 align:middle line:84%
>>CLOW: So there you are
in your early to mid 30s,

00:19:12.730 --> 00:19:15.500 align:middle line:84%
and you've changed something,
and you're adjusting,

00:19:15.500 --> 00:19:18.210 align:middle line:84%
and you're starting to
develop yourself emotionally.

00:19:18.210 --> 00:19:20.950 align:middle line:84%
And then as you start to
approach midlife crisis,

00:19:20.950 --> 00:19:24.107 align:middle line:84%
the next major one is
Uranus opposite Uranus.

00:19:24.107 --> 00:19:24.690 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:19:24.690 --> 00:19:27.280 align:middle line:84%
>>CLOW: Then what happens is
just like Saturn return is

00:19:27.280 --> 00:19:30.920 align:middle line:84%
a physical change, then
Uranus opposite Uranus,

00:19:30.920 --> 00:19:32.700 align:middle line:90%
is an emotional change.

00:19:32.700 --> 00:19:33.760 align:middle line:90%
And it's tough.

00:19:33.760 --> 00:19:35.377 align:middle line:90%
It's really, really--

00:19:35.377 --> 00:19:37.710 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: I wrote down 38 to
42, right in there is the--

00:19:37.710 --> 00:19:39.530 align:middle line:84%
>>CLOW: Actually,
about 38 to 46.

00:19:39.530 --> 00:19:40.465 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: 38 to 46.

00:19:40.465 --> 00:19:41.330 align:middle line:90%
>>CLOW: Yeah.

00:19:41.330 --> 00:19:43.060 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And you also
wrote in your book

00:19:43.060 --> 00:19:46.800 align:middle line:84%
that when you went through this
particular phase, you said,

00:19:46.800 --> 00:19:48.077 align:middle line:90%
I shook for 18 months.

00:19:48.077 --> 00:19:48.660 align:middle line:90%
>>CLOW: I did.

00:19:48.660 --> 00:19:49.409 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: OK, why?

00:19:49.409 --> 00:19:53.670 align:middle line:84%
What was going on with you that
either intimidated, frightened

00:19:53.670 --> 00:19:54.935 align:middle line:90%
you, or got you off your duff?

00:19:54.935 --> 00:19:56.310 align:middle line:84%
>>CLOW: This is
a great question,

00:19:56.310 --> 00:20:01.370 align:middle line:84%
because the reason I was
shaking for 18 months

00:20:01.370 --> 00:20:04.540 align:middle line:84%
while I was in graduate
school was Kundalini rising.

00:20:04.540 --> 00:20:06.480 align:middle line:84%
So I was in graduate
school while I

00:20:06.480 --> 00:20:09.980 align:middle line:84%
was having Kundalini rising,
and I was half crazy.

00:20:09.980 --> 00:20:15.050 align:middle line:84%
So I think if I'd had this
book that I wrote myself,

00:20:15.050 --> 00:20:17.650 align:middle line:84%
that I wrote after
that, I think I would

00:20:17.650 --> 00:20:20.162 align:middle line:84%
have handled myself
a lot better.

00:20:20.162 --> 00:20:21.620 align:middle line:84%
Because there's
all kinds of things

00:20:21.620 --> 00:20:24.966 align:middle line:84%
you could do when
Kundalini is too intense.

00:20:24.966 --> 00:20:26.840 align:middle line:84%
But I didn't have any
idea what was going on.

00:20:26.840 --> 00:20:27.550 align:middle line:90%
I thought I was going crazy.

00:20:27.550 --> 00:20:28.750 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So where
did it lodge in you?

00:20:28.750 --> 00:20:31.135 align:middle line:84%
You say it lodges in
whatever chakra area that--

00:20:31.135 --> 00:20:33.176 align:middle line:84%
>>CLOW: Well, what was
happening with me I think,

00:20:33.176 --> 00:20:36.210 align:middle line:84%
is that the opening
of my chakra system

00:20:36.210 --> 00:20:38.562 align:middle line:84%
was just so intense that
it was making my whole body

00:20:38.562 --> 00:20:39.353 align:middle line:90%
shake all the time.

00:20:39.353 --> 00:20:41.340 align:middle line:84%
I was just having
creas and Kundalini.

00:20:41.340 --> 00:20:43.410 align:middle line:90%
Everybody thought I was crazy.

00:20:43.410 --> 00:20:46.520 align:middle line:84%
Everybody's who's seen me since,
my graduate student buddies,

00:20:46.520 --> 00:20:48.432 align:middle line:84%
they can't believe
I'm the same person.

00:20:48.432 --> 00:20:49.140 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Really?

00:20:49.140 --> 00:20:49.400 align:middle line:90%
>>CLOW: Yeah.

00:20:49.400 --> 00:20:49.920 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Interesting.

00:20:49.920 --> 00:20:51.090 align:middle line:84%
>>CLOW: And that's
why I wrote the book

00:20:51.090 --> 00:20:52.780 align:middle line:84%
because I want
other people to have

00:20:52.780 --> 00:20:54.570 align:middle line:84%
some idea of what's
going on here.

00:20:54.570 --> 00:20:57.250 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So let's talk
about how that kind of change

00:20:57.250 --> 00:21:02.459 align:middle line:84%
shows up emotionally, ages 38
to 46 then in people's lives.

00:21:02.459 --> 00:21:03.000 align:middle line:90%
>>CLOW: Yeah.

00:21:03.000 --> 00:21:05.915 align:middle line:84%
What happens for people is
people start experiencing heat

00:21:05.915 --> 00:21:07.415 align:middle line:84%
in their bodies,
they can experience

00:21:07.415 --> 00:21:09.850 align:middle line:84%
some quaking and
shaking, the way I did.

00:21:09.850 --> 00:21:11.830 align:middle line:90%
A lot of anxiety.

00:21:11.830 --> 00:21:15.270 align:middle line:84%
It can manifest as like some
kind of free-floating fear

00:21:15.270 --> 00:21:16.630 align:middle line:90%
about reality.

00:21:16.630 --> 00:21:20.210 align:middle line:84%
And you just get to
be very, very anxious.

00:21:20.210 --> 00:21:22.900 align:middle line:84%
And then, when that first
transit, the first Uranus

00:21:22.900 --> 00:21:25.870 align:middle line:84%
opposite Uranus actually
occurs, whatever age

00:21:25.870 --> 00:21:28.570 align:middle line:84%
that is, then what happens
is Kundalini starts

00:21:28.570 --> 00:21:30.930 align:middle line:90%
rising in the lower chakras.

00:21:30.930 --> 00:21:33.640 align:middle line:84%
And then as it's moving through
the chakras, what it's doing

00:21:33.640 --> 00:21:36.520 align:middle line:84%
is it's clearing out
blockages and clearing out

00:21:36.520 --> 00:21:39.220 align:middle line:84%
issues that need to move
out of your consciousness

00:21:39.220 --> 00:21:41.680 align:middle line:84%
so that you can go
to another level.

00:21:41.680 --> 00:21:43.965 align:middle line:84%
So if you're really blocked
in the solar plexus,

00:21:43.965 --> 00:21:45.340 align:middle line:84%
at that point in
your life you're

00:21:45.340 --> 00:21:47.631 align:middle line:84%
going to be having fights
with every-- probably getting

00:21:47.631 --> 00:21:49.990 align:middle line:84%
a divorce, having a
major smash and crash.

00:21:49.990 --> 00:21:50.750 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Because that's will
and ego and so forth, right?

00:21:50.750 --> 00:21:51.580 align:middle line:90%
>>CLOW: Yeah.

00:21:51.580 --> 00:21:54.380 align:middle line:84%
Or you're maybe in business
and you may be having lawsuits.

00:21:54.380 --> 00:21:57.490 align:middle line:84%
A lot of lawsuits at
Uranus opposite Uranus.

00:21:57.490 --> 00:21:59.600 align:middle line:84%
And then what happens
is the energy moves

00:21:59.600 --> 00:22:02.700 align:middle line:84%
through the solar plexus as
a result of all this conflict

00:22:02.700 --> 00:22:05.110 align:middle line:84%
and all this resolution
that you're working on.

00:22:05.110 --> 00:22:07.280 align:middle line:84%
And then the energy
moves into the heart.

00:22:07.280 --> 00:22:09.580 align:middle line:84%
And the goal of
midlife crisis is

00:22:09.580 --> 00:22:11.830 align:middle line:84%
to move the energy
into the heart

00:22:11.830 --> 00:22:14.640 align:middle line:84%
and through the lower
chakras, because once we

00:22:14.640 --> 00:22:16.790 align:middle line:84%
move the energy
into the heart, then

00:22:16.790 --> 00:22:19.680 align:middle line:84%
we're able to go to the next
level of emotional growth,

00:22:19.680 --> 00:22:21.240 align:middle line:90%
which is a higher level.

00:22:21.240 --> 00:22:24.270 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: You speak a lot
about sexuality in relationship

00:22:24.270 --> 00:22:28.510 align:middle line:84%
to the Kundalini and the
astrological aspects.

00:22:28.510 --> 00:22:31.645 align:middle line:84%
Now, what about people
who are just blocked?

00:22:31.645 --> 00:22:35.750 align:middle line:84%
They don't experience Kundalini
in any kind of sexual way,

00:22:35.750 --> 00:22:38.270 align:middle line:84%
versus also people
who experience it

00:22:38.270 --> 00:22:40.900 align:middle line:84%
only in a sexual way
in that age group.

00:22:40.900 --> 00:22:45.760 align:middle line:84%
Can you talk about the variances
of sexual behaviors and desires

00:22:45.760 --> 00:22:47.464 align:middle line:90%
that happen, and blocks.

00:22:47.464 --> 00:22:48.880 align:middle line:84%
>>CLOW: First of
all, ideally, you

00:22:48.880 --> 00:22:50.990 align:middle line:84%
have an active sexual
life at this point,

00:22:50.990 --> 00:22:54.310 align:middle line:84%
because sexuality is a
wonderful way and an active way

00:22:54.310 --> 00:22:56.090 align:middle line:90%
to move these energies.

00:22:56.090 --> 00:22:59.760 align:middle line:84%
And so if people do
not have a sexual life,

00:22:59.760 --> 00:23:03.260 align:middle line:84%
then I advise a lot of
meditation, and a lot of yoga,

00:23:03.260 --> 00:23:05.020 align:middle line:84%
and a lot of
alternative techniques

00:23:05.020 --> 00:23:06.390 align:middle line:90%
for moving Kundalini.

00:23:06.390 --> 00:23:09.627 align:middle line:84%
Because see, the Kundalini's
going to move no matter what.

00:23:09.627 --> 00:23:11.210 align:middle line:84%
And the only issue
is how you're going

00:23:11.210 --> 00:23:12.890 align:middle line:90%
to process that Kundalini.

00:23:12.890 --> 00:23:16.240 align:middle line:84%
And then in relationships,
the reason that midlife crisis

00:23:16.240 --> 00:23:18.260 align:middle line:84%
is such a big deal,
and in this case

00:23:18.260 --> 00:23:20.910 align:middle line:84%
we're talking heterosexual
relationships.

00:23:20.910 --> 00:23:22.770 align:middle line:84%
I'm not leaving out
two men and two women,

00:23:22.770 --> 00:23:25.890 align:middle line:84%
it's just that I'm dealing
with a male/female issue.

00:23:25.890 --> 00:23:29.440 align:middle line:84%
In that what happens for the
male during midlife crisis

00:23:29.440 --> 00:23:31.130 align:middle line:84%
is usually there
are some problems

00:23:31.130 --> 00:23:34.440 align:middle line:84%
with sexual dysfunction when
Kundalini starts rising.

00:23:34.440 --> 00:23:36.660 align:middle line:84%
And the reason for
that is that the male

00:23:36.660 --> 00:23:39.530 align:middle line:84%
has learned how to hold the
energy in the root chakra

00:23:39.530 --> 00:23:43.660 align:middle line:84%
in order to have an
easy and long erection.

00:23:43.660 --> 00:23:46.665 align:middle line:84%
But when the energy starts
moving out of the sacral chakra

00:23:46.665 --> 00:23:49.924 align:middle line:84%
and into the solar plexus
and then up into the heart,

00:23:49.924 --> 00:23:51.340 align:middle line:84%
quite a few men
will have problems

00:23:51.340 --> 00:23:52.800 align:middle line:90%
with sexual dysfunction.

00:23:52.800 --> 00:23:54.815 align:middle line:84%
And this-- yeah,
it's interesting.

00:23:54.815 --> 00:23:57.950 align:middle line:84%
I have quite a few men
coming to me with this issue,

00:23:57.950 --> 00:24:00.983 align:middle line:84%
and boy, I got a lot-- I
can create a lot of relief

00:24:00.983 --> 00:24:01.483 align:middle line:90%
for people.

00:24:01.483 --> 00:24:04.024 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Yes, because there's
nothing physiologically wrong.

00:24:04.024 --> 00:24:04.590 align:middle line:90%
>>CLOW: No.

00:24:04.590 --> 00:24:07.220 align:middle line:84%
For instance, one of the
reasons that men have affairs

00:24:07.220 --> 00:24:09.672 align:middle line:84%
at this point is
they're not having

00:24:09.672 --> 00:24:11.630 align:middle line:84%
a very good sexual
relationship with their wife

00:24:11.630 --> 00:24:13.340 align:middle line:84%
because their
energy is changing,

00:24:13.340 --> 00:24:15.620 align:middle line:84%
and they're not used to
relating from the heart yet.

00:24:15.620 --> 00:24:19.350 align:middle line:84%
Because see, once this energy
has moved into the heart chakra

00:24:19.350 --> 00:24:21.390 align:middle line:84%
and into the higher
chakras, then this all

00:24:21.390 --> 00:24:25.990 align:middle line:84%
straightens itself out and
the phallic function improves.

00:24:25.990 --> 00:24:28.380 align:middle line:84%
So men go out and think,
well, it's my wife.

00:24:28.380 --> 00:24:29.882 align:middle line:90%
I'll just go find a chick.

00:24:29.882 --> 00:24:31.840 align:middle line:84%
And that may work for a
few weeks or something,

00:24:31.840 --> 00:24:34.050 align:middle line:84%
but then the same thing
will happen with the chick

00:24:34.050 --> 00:24:35.423 align:middle line:90%
or whoever they pick up.

00:24:35.423 --> 00:24:37.057 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: But that's also
because there's that new hope

00:24:37.057 --> 00:24:37.170 align:middle line:90%
in the air--

00:24:37.170 --> 00:24:37.245 align:middle line:90%
>>CLOW: Oh, yeah.

00:24:37.245 --> 00:24:37.320 align:middle line:90%
That's true.

00:24:37.320 --> 00:24:38.296 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: --and no judgment.

00:24:38.296 --> 00:24:40.248 align:middle line:84%
And so that can all kind of
transpire as it needs to.

00:24:40.248 --> 00:24:40.740 align:middle line:90%
>>CLOW: Yeah.

00:24:40.740 --> 00:24:42.160 align:middle line:84%
You can have that
hot infatuation

00:24:42.160 --> 00:24:44.034 align:middle line:84%
and that will override
even Kundalini rising.

00:24:44.034 --> 00:24:45.790 align:middle line:90%
But then even that goes down.

00:24:45.790 --> 00:24:47.802 align:middle line:84%
But then at the same
time, what about women?

00:24:47.802 --> 00:24:49.510 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: That's what
I was going to ask.

00:24:49.510 --> 00:24:50.885 align:middle line:84%
>>CLOW: Well,
women at this point

00:24:50.885 --> 00:24:52.840 align:middle line:84%
want to move the
energy into the heart.

00:24:52.840 --> 00:24:53.590 align:middle line:90%
And they want to--

00:24:53.590 --> 00:24:55.000 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Well, a lot of
times they're moms now.

00:24:55.000 --> 00:24:56.542 align:middle line:84%
They're engaged in
childbearing, too.

00:24:56.542 --> 00:24:57.125 align:middle line:90%
>>CLOW: Right.

00:24:57.125 --> 00:24:57.810 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:24:57.810 --> 00:24:59.990 align:middle line:84%
Well, basically what
happens for women

00:24:59.990 --> 00:25:02.850 align:middle line:84%
is because women are
mothers, and because they're

00:25:02.850 --> 00:25:05.410 align:middle line:84%
going through the complexity
that women often have,

00:25:05.410 --> 00:25:07.730 align:middle line:84%
all they want to do is
get off by themselves.

00:25:07.730 --> 00:25:09.620 align:middle line:90%
So what a hot combination.

00:25:09.620 --> 00:25:12.150 align:middle line:84%
And so I did a lot of
counseling back in those days,

00:25:12.150 --> 00:25:16.500 align:middle line:84%
advising the husband, like,
OK, just give her some space.

00:25:16.500 --> 00:25:19.720 align:middle line:84%
I even had one client who
all his wife wanted to do

00:25:19.720 --> 00:25:22.680 align:middle line:84%
is go to Sweden for a year,
and they had three children.

00:25:22.680 --> 00:25:25.180 align:middle line:84%
And he was actually
able to let her go,

00:25:25.180 --> 00:25:28.080 align:middle line:84%
and she went, and she came back,
and they're still together.

00:25:28.080 --> 00:25:29.592 align:middle line:90%
But she had to get out of there.

00:25:29.592 --> 00:25:31.550 align:middle line:84%
She was just ready to
explode the whole family.

00:25:31.550 --> 00:25:33.216 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: OK, now
let's talk about that.

00:25:33.216 --> 00:25:35.350 align:middle line:84%
You do in the book,
about there is

00:25:35.350 --> 00:25:37.230 align:middle line:84%
a type of female
communication that

00:25:37.230 --> 00:25:40.590 align:middle line:84%
happens that is very repressed,
as it has been in more

00:25:40.590 --> 00:25:43.640 align:middle line:84%
of the patriarchal paradigm that
we're just now moving out of.

00:25:43.640 --> 00:25:44.240 align:middle line:90%
>>CLOW: Right.

00:25:44.240 --> 00:25:45.930 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: It has been repressed.

00:25:45.930 --> 00:25:49.760 align:middle line:84%
And so what happens at this
stage when the Kundalini is

00:25:49.760 --> 00:25:52.640 align:middle line:84%
rising and you have not been
able to share your truth?

00:25:52.640 --> 00:25:54.450 align:middle line:84%
>>CLOW: Oh, it's a
very, very big issue.

00:25:54.450 --> 00:25:56.940 align:middle line:84%
So part of that
desire to go off alone

00:25:56.940 --> 00:25:59.049 align:middle line:84%
is to find out
what your truth is,

00:25:59.049 --> 00:26:00.840 align:middle line:84%
because you've been
distracted for maybe 20

00:26:00.840 --> 00:26:02.880 align:middle line:84%
years of your life,
and you have no idea.

00:26:02.880 --> 00:26:04.970 align:middle line:90%
All you know is you're lost.

00:26:04.970 --> 00:26:06.530 align:middle line:84%
And so you can see
what a big crisis

00:26:06.530 --> 00:26:08.707 align:middle line:90%
that could be with a couple.

00:26:08.707 --> 00:26:09.290 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:26:09.290 --> 00:26:12.190 align:middle line:84%
Now, and that's where if you're
roughly the same age group.

00:26:12.190 --> 00:26:12.960 align:middle line:90%
>>CLOW: Um-hmm.

00:26:12.960 --> 00:26:15.590 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And now, the beauty
of not being in the same age

00:26:15.590 --> 00:26:18.266 align:middle line:84%
group, saying that a 10
year disparity is one of you

00:26:18.266 --> 00:26:19.390 align:middle line:90%
has already passed through.

00:26:19.390 --> 00:26:20.820 align:middle line:90%
You're safely to the other side.

00:26:20.820 --> 00:26:22.990 align:middle line:84%
Well, before the next
one hits you, anyway.

00:26:22.990 --> 00:26:27.110 align:middle line:84%
And then the other one has kind
of a little more support going

00:26:27.110 --> 00:26:27.980 align:middle line:90%
through it, right?

00:26:27.980 --> 00:26:28.172 align:middle line:90%
>>CLOW: Yeah.

00:26:28.172 --> 00:26:28.460 align:middle line:90%
That can happen.

00:26:28.460 --> 00:26:29.360 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: And you see that.

00:26:29.360 --> 00:26:29.901 align:middle line:90%
>>CLOW: Yeah.

00:26:29.901 --> 00:26:32.590 align:middle line:84%
I think I do tend to think it's
a little bit easier when people

00:26:32.590 --> 00:26:34.370 align:middle line:84%
aren't exactly the
same age because--

00:26:34.370 --> 00:26:35.435 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: They are not
exactly the same age.

00:26:35.435 --> 00:26:35.860 align:middle line:90%
>>CLOW: Yeah.

00:26:35.860 --> 00:26:37.670 align:middle line:84%
I think it's a little
bit easier if there's

00:26:37.670 --> 00:26:39.620 align:middle line:84%
an age difference,
yeah, because of this.

00:26:39.620 --> 00:26:40.350 align:middle line:90%
You can see that.

00:26:40.350 --> 00:26:42.830 align:middle line:84%
If it hits at exactly the same
time it's kind of obvious.

00:26:42.830 --> 00:26:43.820 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:26:43.820 --> 00:26:47.020 align:middle line:84%
OK, so now you also
advise people in the book

00:26:47.020 --> 00:26:51.240 align:middle line:84%
that if you're in this
particular phase, Uranus phase,

00:26:51.240 --> 00:26:54.980 align:middle line:84%
not to consider getting
married at this time either.

00:26:54.980 --> 00:26:56.160 align:middle line:90%
So let's talk about that.

00:26:56.160 --> 00:26:56.400 align:middle line:90%
>>CLOW: Sure.

00:26:56.400 --> 00:26:57.540 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Because that's
when a lot of people

00:26:57.540 --> 00:26:59.540 align:middle line:84%
are wanting to get married,
women have a career.

00:26:59.540 --> 00:27:03.690 align:middle line:84%
Now the baby clock's going off,
and they're 38, 40 years old,

00:27:03.690 --> 00:27:04.940 align:middle line:90%
got to get on with this thing.

00:27:04.940 --> 00:27:06.190 align:middle line:90%
And you're saying don't do it.

00:27:06.190 --> 00:27:07.380 align:middle line:90%
>>CLOW: Yeah.

00:27:07.380 --> 00:27:08.540 align:middle line:90%
Yeah, definitely.

00:27:08.540 --> 00:27:11.570 align:middle line:84%
If you're right on the verge of
having Uranus opposite Uranus,

00:27:11.570 --> 00:27:15.240 align:middle line:84%
age 38 to 42, 44,
wherever you are,

00:27:15.240 --> 00:27:17.340 align:middle line:84%
it would be better
to just continue

00:27:17.340 --> 00:27:20.270 align:middle line:84%
the relationship for a little
while before you get married.

00:27:20.270 --> 00:27:23.022 align:middle line:84%
And it's very hard to have
a child at that age, too.

00:27:23.022 --> 00:27:24.730 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: When you're
going through that.

00:27:24.730 --> 00:27:25.271 align:middle line:90%
>>CLOW: Yeah.

00:27:25.271 --> 00:27:28.330 align:middle line:84%
And so think of how many women
are having, at this point,

00:27:28.330 --> 00:27:30.600 align:middle line:84%
are having their first
child when they're

00:27:30.600 --> 00:27:32.420 align:middle line:90%
going through Uranus opposition.

00:27:32.420 --> 00:27:34.570 align:middle line:90%
It can be very, very difficult.

00:27:34.570 --> 00:27:36.740 align:middle line:84%
And that's why that
older pattern-- I know,

00:27:36.740 --> 00:27:39.070 align:middle line:84%
I hate to say it-- but that
older pattern of getting

00:27:39.070 --> 00:27:42.950 align:middle line:84%
married in your 20s and Saturn
return, and having children

00:27:42.950 --> 00:27:45.870 align:middle line:84%
before these
transits hit, there's

00:27:45.870 --> 00:27:47.599 align:middle line:84%
actually a lot of
good reasons for that.

00:27:47.599 --> 00:27:48.140 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: OK.

00:27:48.140 --> 00:27:51.140 align:middle line:84%
Now let's talk about, OK, that's
some of the practical nuts

00:27:51.140 --> 00:27:55.160 align:middle line:84%
and bolts of that one
trend-- the Uranus part.

00:27:55.160 --> 00:27:58.600 align:middle line:84%
What about the transcendent
and defined part,

00:27:58.600 --> 00:28:02.330 align:middle line:84%
and encouraging that part of the
Kundalini rising at this age.

00:28:02.330 --> 00:28:03.660 align:middle line:90%
I don't see too much of that.

00:28:03.660 --> 00:28:07.550 align:middle line:84%
I mean I've interviewed people
that had this happen to them.

00:28:07.550 --> 00:28:09.900 align:middle line:84%
Sometimes even associated
with a near death experience--

00:28:09.900 --> 00:28:10.260 align:middle line:90%
>>CLOW: Oh, sure.

00:28:10.260 --> 00:28:11.843 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: --if you
go that far, right.

00:28:11.843 --> 00:28:12.860 align:middle line:90%
>>CLOW: Oh, yeah.

00:28:12.860 --> 00:28:16.150 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And you say
you can use meditation,

00:28:16.150 --> 00:28:17.650 align:middle line:84%
you can use yoga
and other things.

00:28:17.650 --> 00:28:21.530 align:middle line:84%
But how do we use that to have
that wonderful transcendent

00:28:21.530 --> 00:28:22.039 align:middle line:90%
experience?

00:28:22.039 --> 00:28:22.580 align:middle line:90%
>>CLOW: Yeah.

00:28:22.580 --> 00:28:24.540 align:middle line:84%
So what you're really asking,
which is a great question,

00:28:24.540 --> 00:28:25.845 align:middle line:90%
is how can we create that?

00:28:25.845 --> 00:28:26.470 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:28:26.470 --> 00:28:28.970 align:middle line:84%
>>CLOW: So what goes
on transit-wise is OK,

00:28:28.970 --> 00:28:32.790 align:middle line:84%
at midlife crisis you go through
an emotional transformation

00:28:32.790 --> 00:28:36.300 align:middle line:84%
in order to prepare yourself
for a spiritual development.

00:28:36.300 --> 00:28:39.210 align:middle line:84%
So after you go
through midlife crisis,

00:28:39.210 --> 00:28:41.075 align:middle line:84%
you've gone through
that emotional change

00:28:41.075 --> 00:28:43.140 align:middle line:90%
and you're into your 40s.

00:28:43.140 --> 00:28:44.597 align:middle line:84%
You're approaching
Chiron return.

00:28:44.597 --> 00:28:46.180 align:middle line:84%
And I'm going to do
these two together

00:28:46.180 --> 00:28:49.280 align:middle line:84%
a little bit because what
happens at Chiron return

00:28:49.280 --> 00:28:52.270 align:middle line:84%
is actually very strongly
dependent upon what

00:28:52.270 --> 00:28:54.480 align:middle line:90%
happens at midlife crisis.

00:28:54.480 --> 00:28:57.420 align:middle line:84%
So let's take a person who
goes through an emotional

00:28:57.420 --> 00:29:00.520 align:middle line:84%
transformation and
it really works,

00:29:00.520 --> 00:29:04.330 align:middle line:84%
and it enables them to start to
develop themselves spiritually.

00:29:04.330 --> 00:29:06.120 align:middle line:84%
Then what will
happen is the energy

00:29:06.120 --> 00:29:08.750 align:middle line:84%
will move out of the heart
and into this throat,

00:29:08.750 --> 00:29:11.900 align:middle line:84%
and the person will start being
able to speak their truth.

00:29:11.900 --> 00:29:15.280 align:middle line:84%
And then the energy will move
into the third eye chakra,

00:29:15.280 --> 00:29:16.940 align:middle line:84%
where the person
will begin to start

00:29:16.940 --> 00:29:19.540 align:middle line:84%
having psychic and
seership abilities.

00:29:19.540 --> 00:29:22.410 align:middle line:84%
And then the energy will
move up into the crown chakra

00:29:22.410 --> 00:29:25.040 align:middle line:84%
where a person will
experience enlightenment.

00:29:25.040 --> 00:29:28.570 align:middle line:84%
So the first pattern
would be if a person does

00:29:28.570 --> 00:29:32.420 align:middle line:84%
go through a radical emotional
transformation at Uranus

00:29:32.420 --> 00:29:35.060 align:middle line:84%
opposite Uranus,
their chakra system

00:29:35.060 --> 00:29:37.350 align:middle line:84%
is automatically
going to start helping

00:29:37.350 --> 00:29:40.690 align:middle line:84%
them open into spiritual
dimensions of consciousness.

00:29:40.690 --> 00:29:43.114 align:middle line:84%
And as you know, you never
want to do this too fast.

00:29:43.114 --> 00:29:43.780 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:29:43.780 --> 00:29:46.350 align:middle line:84%
>>CLOW: So the wonderful thing
about this natural movement

00:29:46.350 --> 00:29:49.940 align:middle line:84%
of the chakra opening is that
it's a natural process that

00:29:49.940 --> 00:29:54.060 align:middle line:84%
works very well if you change
a lot at midlife crisis.

00:29:54.060 --> 00:29:56.900 align:middle line:84%
But a lot of people don't
change at midlife crisis.

00:29:56.900 --> 00:30:00.910 align:middle line:84%
I mentioned to you that
I think 95% of people

00:30:00.910 --> 00:30:03.640 align:middle line:90%
transform at Saturn return.

00:30:03.640 --> 00:30:06.380 align:middle line:84%
But my estimate
at midlife crisis

00:30:06.380 --> 00:30:09.310 align:middle line:84%
is somewhere around maybe--
at this point it's rising.

00:30:09.310 --> 00:30:12.100 align:middle line:84%
Like back 20 years ago when
I first wrote the book,

00:30:12.100 --> 00:30:15.440 align:middle line:84%
maybe 15% to 20% of people
were changing pretty radically

00:30:15.440 --> 00:30:17.030 align:middle line:90%
at midlife crisis.

00:30:17.030 --> 00:30:18.720 align:middle line:84%
And see, changing
pretty radically,

00:30:18.720 --> 00:30:20.810 align:middle line:84%
that means the positive
conscious change.

00:30:20.810 --> 00:30:22.980 align:middle line:84%
It doesn't mean this
mash and crash divorce,

00:30:22.980 --> 00:30:24.490 align:middle line:90%
and marrying another person.

00:30:24.490 --> 00:30:26.950 align:middle line:90%
It means a real conscious shift.

00:30:26.950 --> 00:30:30.080 align:middle line:84%
So if the person-- At this point
I'm estimating that probably

00:30:30.080 --> 00:30:33.470 align:middle line:84%
around 30%, maybe
even 40% of people

00:30:33.470 --> 00:30:36.960 align:middle line:84%
are actually going through
an emotional transformation

00:30:36.960 --> 00:30:38.070 align:middle line:90%
at midlife crisis.

00:30:38.070 --> 00:30:40.340 align:middle line:84%
I'm watching people and
I'm seeing this happening.

00:30:40.340 --> 00:30:41.170 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: That's helpful.

00:30:41.170 --> 00:30:42.044 align:middle line:90%
>>CLOW: Yeah, I know.

00:30:42.044 --> 00:30:44.770 align:middle line:84%
And because I think that
what we're talking about here

00:30:44.770 --> 00:30:48.720 align:middle line:84%
is a level of development
that has been natural to us

00:30:48.720 --> 00:30:50.620 align:middle line:84%
for thousands of years
and was shut down

00:30:50.620 --> 00:30:51.852 align:middle line:90%
about 5,000 years ago.

00:30:51.852 --> 00:30:53.602 align:middle line:84%
In other words, I don't
think it's normal.

00:30:53.602 --> 00:30:54.370 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Would you say that's
time for the patriarchal.

00:30:54.370 --> 00:30:54.911 align:middle line:90%
>>CLOW: Yeah.

00:30:54.911 --> 00:30:56.220 align:middle line:90%
It's a patriarchal shut down.

00:30:56.220 --> 00:30:58.553 align:middle line:84%
And I don't think it's normal
to be shut down like this.

00:30:58.553 --> 00:31:01.600 align:middle line:84%
And if we look at indigenous
cultures or ancient cultures,

00:31:01.600 --> 00:31:03.720 align:middle line:84%
they have different
initiatic processes

00:31:03.720 --> 00:31:06.650 align:middle line:84%
at all of these stages in
order to assist a person

00:31:06.650 --> 00:31:08.360 align:middle line:90%
to go to another level.

00:31:08.360 --> 00:31:11.600 align:middle line:84%
So speaking of Chiron
return, Chiron return

00:31:11.600 --> 00:31:14.780 align:middle line:84%
has to do with the illumination
of the crown chakra.

00:31:14.780 --> 00:31:17.760 align:middle line:84%
And earlier, you mentioned
to me privately this issue

00:31:17.760 --> 00:31:19.610 align:middle line:84%
of Chiron square,
Chiron opposition,

00:31:19.610 --> 00:31:21.145 align:middle line:90%
and Chiron upper square.

00:31:21.145 --> 00:31:21.500 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: I want to
get into that a bit.

00:31:21.500 --> 00:31:23.730 align:middle line:84%
>>CLOW: Chiron has
two transit patterns.

00:31:23.730 --> 00:31:26.860 align:middle line:84%
One is the square to our
Chiron in our birth chart,

00:31:26.860 --> 00:31:29.470 align:middle line:84%
and then opposition,
and then upper square.

00:31:29.470 --> 00:31:33.370 align:middle line:84%
And in each one of those square
and opposition positions,

00:31:33.370 --> 00:31:37.420 align:middle line:84%
what happens is we have a
kind of mystical illumination

00:31:37.420 --> 00:31:37.920 align:middle line:90%
experience.

00:31:37.920 --> 00:31:40.550 align:middle line:84%
Everybody does,
but it's so subtle,

00:31:40.550 --> 00:31:42.560 align:middle line:84%
and it's coming from
those subtle bodies

00:31:42.560 --> 00:31:45.020 align:middle line:84%
that Richard Gerber
is speaking about.

00:31:45.020 --> 00:31:48.550 align:middle line:84%
That what happens at that
point is that a lot of people

00:31:48.550 --> 00:31:50.600 align:middle line:84%
just don't remember
what happened at all.

00:31:50.600 --> 00:31:54.350 align:middle line:84%
But when you come to Chiron
return at age 50 to 51,

00:31:54.350 --> 00:31:57.119 align:middle line:84%
you've reached that point
where you realize spirituality

00:31:57.119 --> 00:31:57.660 align:middle line:90%
is important.

00:31:57.660 --> 00:32:00.120 align:middle line:84%
I mean even if you're the
most ordinary person living

00:32:00.120 --> 00:32:01.620 align:middle line:84%
in the middle of
Kansas or whatever,

00:32:01.620 --> 00:32:04.540 align:middle line:84%
you know that
spirituality is important.

00:32:04.540 --> 00:32:07.480 align:middle line:84%
And so at Chiron
return, if the person

00:32:07.480 --> 00:32:10.580 align:middle line:84%
has gone through an emotional
transformation at Uranus

00:32:10.580 --> 00:32:14.470 align:middle line:84%
opposite Uranus, then
that higher chakra system

00:32:14.470 --> 00:32:17.160 align:middle line:84%
in the crown chakra
opens and people

00:32:17.160 --> 00:32:20.850 align:middle line:84%
have really mystical, magical,
illuminated experiences.

00:32:20.850 --> 00:32:24.130 align:middle line:84%
Which by the way, may
come through only simply

00:32:24.130 --> 00:32:27.660 align:middle line:90%
as realizing one day, I'm happy.

00:32:27.660 --> 00:32:29.530 align:middle line:84%
It might be just
as simple as that.

00:32:29.530 --> 00:32:30.975 align:middle line:84%
It could be just
that moment when

00:32:30.975 --> 00:32:32.183 align:middle line:90%
you're sitting with your dog.

00:32:32.183 --> 00:32:34.350 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Or knowing that
gardening is making you happy.

00:32:34.350 --> 00:32:34.680 align:middle line:90%
>>CLOW: Yeah.

00:32:34.680 --> 00:32:35.240 align:middle line:90%
Your gardening or whatever.

00:32:35.240 --> 00:32:37.190 align:middle line:84%
In other words, it's not about--
you don't have to be a guru,

00:32:37.190 --> 00:32:38.250 align:middle line:90%
if you know what I mean.

00:32:38.250 --> 00:32:38.880 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:32:38.880 --> 00:32:41.290 align:middle line:84%
>>CLOW: But if you
haven't transformed

00:32:41.290 --> 00:32:44.760 align:middle line:84%
at Uranus opposite
Uranus, then what happens

00:32:44.760 --> 00:32:48.350 align:middle line:84%
is at this point the Kundalini
is pushing those higher

00:32:48.350 --> 00:32:51.700 align:middle line:84%
chakras that it's still
stuck at the emotional level.

00:32:51.700 --> 00:32:55.290 align:middle line:84%
Because that breakthrough at
that emotional solar plexus

00:32:55.290 --> 00:32:57.750 align:middle line:84%
heart chakra level
has not occurred.

00:32:57.750 --> 00:33:01.040 align:middle line:84%
And so, a lot of people
have a midlife crisis

00:33:01.040 --> 00:33:02.520 align:middle line:90%
when they're 50 or 51.

00:33:02.520 --> 00:33:05.930 align:middle line:84%
If you watch people closely,
and it's really hard,

00:33:05.930 --> 00:33:09.440 align:middle line:84%
because it's like people just
don't-- People really think

00:33:09.440 --> 00:33:11.810 align:middle line:84%
they're going crazy
at this point.

00:33:11.810 --> 00:33:15.920 align:middle line:84%
So if you're having a lot
of difficulty at age 50, 51,

00:33:15.920 --> 00:33:19.870 align:middle line:84%
then if you can go back to
your 40s and see what you did,

00:33:19.870 --> 00:33:22.169 align:middle line:84%
even if you don't know the
year of your midlife crisis,

00:33:22.169 --> 00:33:22.960 align:middle line:90%
you'll go oh, yeah.

00:33:22.960 --> 00:33:23.710 align:middle line:90%
I remember.

00:33:23.710 --> 00:33:25.680 align:middle line:84%
That was the year I
crashed my car into a tree.

00:33:25.680 --> 00:33:27.450 align:middle line:90%
Whatever you did.

00:33:27.450 --> 00:33:29.430 align:middle line:84%
And if you can
look at that point

00:33:29.430 --> 00:33:32.130 align:middle line:84%
and see what it is that you
didn't do, in other words,

00:33:32.130 --> 00:33:32.670 align:middle line:90%
something was happening--

00:33:32.670 --> 00:33:34.530 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Back when you
were in that 38 to 46 zone.

00:33:34.530 --> 00:33:35.670 align:middle line:90%
>>CLOW: Maybe you were too busy.

00:33:35.670 --> 00:33:37.600 align:middle line:84%
Maybe your career was
driving you too much.

00:33:37.600 --> 00:33:39.740 align:middle line:84%
Maybe you had too
many kids and you

00:33:39.740 --> 00:33:42.240 align:middle line:84%
couldn't take any time
or whatever for yourself.

00:33:42.240 --> 00:33:44.310 align:middle line:84%
If you can look at
what you didn't do,

00:33:44.310 --> 00:33:47.760 align:middle line:84%
usually you can work through
it and clear out the residue.

00:33:47.760 --> 00:33:51.477 align:middle line:84%
Because at 50, 51, you're
really getting pushed the max

00:33:51.477 --> 00:33:52.060 align:middle line:90%
at this point.

00:33:52.060 --> 00:33:54.250 align:middle line:84%
And then if you
manage to shut it down

00:33:54.250 --> 00:33:57.090 align:middle line:84%
at that point, that's
when people start drugging

00:33:57.090 --> 00:33:59.460 align:middle line:84%
themselves, and that's
when people just start

00:33:59.460 --> 00:34:01.500 align:middle line:84%
shut-- they'll do anything
to shut themselves

00:34:01.500 --> 00:34:04.430 align:middle line:84%
down-- sleeping pills,
allopathic drugs.

00:34:04.430 --> 00:34:05.210 align:middle line:90%
You name it.

00:34:05.210 --> 00:34:06.100 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Because it's
too disconcerting.

00:34:06.100 --> 00:34:08.100 align:middle line:84%
That pain of being stuck
in the emotional point.

00:34:08.100 --> 00:34:11.030 align:middle line:84%
>>CLOW: At that point it's
a higher frequency push.

00:34:11.030 --> 00:34:14.070 align:middle line:84%
That emotional push, as
hard as it is-- We all know,

00:34:14.070 --> 00:34:16.210 align:middle line:84%
emotions seem to be
the most difficult.

00:34:16.210 --> 00:34:19.520 align:middle line:84%
The higher frequency pushes
are confusing because people

00:34:19.520 --> 00:34:21.080 align:middle line:90%
can't identify what's going on.

00:34:21.080 --> 00:34:23.500 align:middle line:84%
And then the
culture, the culture

00:34:23.500 --> 00:34:26.156 align:middle line:84%
just simply denies everything
I'm saying as I'm sitting here.

00:34:26.156 --> 00:34:28.280 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Well, and it has
pills to take care of it

00:34:28.280 --> 00:34:28.780 align:middle line:90%
anyway, right.

00:34:28.780 --> 00:34:29.360 align:middle line:90%
>>CLOW: Oh, yeah.

00:34:29.360 --> 00:34:30.670 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And the
thing is that's also

00:34:30.670 --> 00:34:32.794 align:middle line:84%
when people start becoming
physically ill and start

00:34:32.794 --> 00:34:33.890 align:middle line:90%
breaking down physically.

00:34:33.890 --> 00:34:34.250 align:middle line:90%
>>CLOW: That's right.

00:34:34.250 --> 00:34:36.940 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Internal inflammation
starts occurring in the body.

00:34:36.940 --> 00:34:40.610 align:middle line:84%
Degenerative diseases
really pick up in the 50s.

00:34:40.610 --> 00:34:44.010 align:middle line:84%
And it seems to me in
observing people, like you say,

00:34:44.010 --> 00:34:47.150 align:middle line:84%
where there's that deep internal
emotional conflict, that

00:34:47.150 --> 00:34:51.260 align:middle line:84%
seems to be the type of person
that ends up with a little bit

00:34:51.260 --> 00:34:53.250 align:middle line:84%
more of these chronic
conditions, physically.

00:34:53.250 --> 00:34:53.550 align:middle line:90%
>>CLOW: Yeah.

00:34:53.550 --> 00:34:54.120 align:middle line:90%
Oh, yeah.

00:34:54.120 --> 00:34:54.620 align:middle line:90%
Definitely.

00:34:54.620 --> 00:34:57.050 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And so going back
to the sexual aspect of it,

00:34:57.050 --> 00:35:00.140 align:middle line:84%
you say in this Uranus
phase, 38 to 46,

00:35:00.140 --> 00:35:03.890 align:middle line:84%
that it's important to have a
good clear, open, easy, sexual

00:35:03.890 --> 00:35:06.100 align:middle line:90%
life, ideally.

00:35:06.100 --> 00:35:08.660 align:middle line:84%
What happens if you've
gone into resistance?

00:35:08.660 --> 00:35:09.936 align:middle line:90%
Women are tired of the gig?

00:35:09.936 --> 00:35:12.310 align:middle line:84%
Some of them-- Because I know
a lot of women in their 30s

00:35:12.310 --> 00:35:13.770 align:middle line:90%
are like, I've had it.

00:35:13.770 --> 00:35:15.184 align:middle line:84%
I'm not going to
do that anymore.

00:35:15.184 --> 00:35:16.350 align:middle line:90%
I'm going to do what I want.

00:35:16.350 --> 00:35:19.120 align:middle line:84%
But right when a time
when people are actually

00:35:19.120 --> 00:35:22.410 align:middle line:84%
physically quite capable
and juiced up, so

00:35:22.410 --> 00:35:24.090 align:middle line:84%
to speak, what's
happening there when

00:35:24.090 --> 00:35:27.740 align:middle line:84%
it goes into dysfunction, and
then competition with the male?

00:35:27.740 --> 00:35:30.070 align:middle line:84%
>>CLOW: You know, I don't
feel that I understand that

00:35:30.070 --> 00:35:30.730 align:middle line:90%
very well.

00:35:30.730 --> 00:35:34.500 align:middle line:84%
And I'm noticing some
pretty major sexual changes

00:35:34.500 --> 00:35:38.084 align:middle line:84%
that seem to be going on with
the generations below me.

00:35:38.084 --> 00:35:40.500 align:middle line:84%
And I actually think, I don't
know whether things going on

00:35:40.500 --> 00:35:43.250 align:middle line:84%
with chemicals or what's
going on in our reality,

00:35:43.250 --> 00:35:45.280 align:middle line:84%
but I think people are
approaching sexuality

00:35:45.280 --> 00:35:47.380 align:middle line:90%
in a very, very different way.

00:35:47.380 --> 00:35:52.150 align:middle line:84%
And so I'm going to be watching
to see how this information--

00:35:52.150 --> 00:35:53.400 align:middle line:90%
you know how it is with books.

00:35:53.400 --> 00:35:54.900 align:middle line:84%
This could be
information that works

00:35:54.900 --> 00:35:56.237 align:middle line:90%
for about three generations.

00:35:56.237 --> 00:35:56.820 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:35:56.820 --> 00:35:58.486 align:middle line:84%
>>CLOW: Because there's
a paradigm in it

00:35:58.486 --> 00:36:00.720 align:middle line:84%
that that's really needed
for them at that point.

00:36:00.720 --> 00:36:03.660 align:middle line:84%
And it's possible
that the generations

00:36:03.660 --> 00:36:06.610 align:middle line:84%
younger than we
are may be working

00:36:06.610 --> 00:36:08.060 align:middle line:90%
on something entirely different.

00:36:08.060 --> 00:36:10.200 align:middle line:84%
For example, studies
are coming out

00:36:10.200 --> 00:36:14.760 align:middle line:84%
now showing that couples
where the man is helping

00:36:14.760 --> 00:36:17.720 align:middle line:84%
as much as the woman and
those kinds of things

00:36:17.720 --> 00:36:20.060 align:middle line:84%
are showing that there's
less sex going on.

00:36:20.060 --> 00:36:20.640 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes, I've read that.

00:36:20.640 --> 00:36:21.330 align:middle line:90%
>>CLOW: Have you read that?

00:36:21.330 --> 00:36:21.830 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:36:21.830 --> 00:36:23.430 align:middle line:90%
And so that's OK.

00:36:23.430 --> 00:36:25.980 align:middle line:84%
If they're focusing
on something else

00:36:25.980 --> 00:36:28.680 align:middle line:84%
and finding another way to work
with energy-- What we're really

00:36:28.680 --> 00:36:31.430 align:middle line:84%
talking about here is
working with energy.

00:36:31.430 --> 00:36:33.440 align:middle line:84%
And for the generation
of people who

00:36:33.440 --> 00:36:35.940 align:middle line:84%
came after the
Victorian generation,

00:36:35.940 --> 00:36:39.070 align:middle line:84%
the sexual breakthrough
was of critical importance.

00:36:39.070 --> 00:36:42.650 align:middle line:84%
But we may have already broken
through the sexual inhibition,

00:36:42.650 --> 00:36:45.830 align:middle line:84%
so now it's OK for anybody
to do anything they want.

00:36:45.830 --> 00:36:48.350 align:middle line:84%
And then you may have people
going well, I want to do it,

00:36:48.350 --> 00:36:50.850 align:middle line:84%
and somebody else is going to
say no, I don't want to do it.

00:36:50.850 --> 00:36:52.126 align:middle line:90%
And that's perfectly OK.

00:36:52.126 --> 00:36:53.750 align:middle line:84%
That could be nature
just compensating.

00:36:53.750 --> 00:36:55.470 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And men taking
on more feminine traits

00:36:55.470 --> 00:36:56.928 align:middle line:84%
in their behavior,
and women taking

00:36:56.928 --> 00:36:58.920 align:middle line:84%
on more masculine traits
in their behavior.

00:36:58.920 --> 00:36:59.690 align:middle line:90%
>>CLOW: Yeah.

00:36:59.690 --> 00:37:00.760 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Because that seems
to be one of the trends.

00:37:00.760 --> 00:37:02.593 align:middle line:84%
>>CLOW: It could be
that a lot of the energy

00:37:02.593 --> 00:37:05.180 align:middle line:84%
is going into what I call
androgynous and individuation.

00:37:05.180 --> 00:37:05.620 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: That's
what I'm getting to.

00:37:05.620 --> 00:37:06.650 align:middle line:90%
>>CLOW: Yeah, I know.

00:37:06.650 --> 00:37:08.500 align:middle line:84%
And it could be
that that discovery

00:37:08.500 --> 00:37:11.150 align:middle line:84%
in a woman of the
internal male, or the male

00:37:11.150 --> 00:37:15.620 align:middle line:84%
of the internal female could
be the most important usage

00:37:15.620 --> 00:37:16.500 align:middle line:90%
of the energy.

00:37:16.500 --> 00:37:18.500 align:middle line:84%
And then another
usage of the energy

00:37:18.500 --> 00:37:20.480 align:middle line:84%
that I think is really
fascinating to me

00:37:20.480 --> 00:37:22.660 align:middle line:84%
right now, because now
I have a granddaughter,

00:37:22.660 --> 00:37:25.720 align:middle line:84%
is that men are being
changed profoundly

00:37:25.720 --> 00:37:27.640 align:middle line:90%
by caring for their children.

00:37:27.640 --> 00:37:31.140 align:middle line:84%
And at this point, a
very big majority of men

00:37:31.140 --> 00:37:33.750 align:middle line:84%
are now mothering,
as well as fathering.

00:37:33.750 --> 00:37:36.580 align:middle line:84%
And so I think the energy is
going more in that direction.

00:37:36.580 --> 00:37:39.060 align:middle line:84%
Because for women,
we've had, those

00:37:39.060 --> 00:37:41.070 align:middle line:84%
of us who have had
children, or those

00:37:41.070 --> 00:37:43.190 align:middle line:84%
who have cared for
children-- after all, women

00:37:43.190 --> 00:37:45.120 align:middle line:84%
seem to either have
them or care for them.

00:37:45.120 --> 00:37:48.250 align:middle line:84%
And we have opened our heart
chakra for thousands of years

00:37:48.250 --> 00:37:49.795 align:middle line:84%
by caring for
children, and now men

00:37:49.795 --> 00:37:51.955 align:middle line:84%
are being given
this opportunity.

00:37:51.955 --> 00:37:54.260 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So the trade-off
is that there may not

00:37:54.260 --> 00:37:57.910 align:middle line:84%
be that classic old style
sexual charge because

00:37:57.910 --> 00:37:59.390 align:middle line:90%
of the polarities.

00:37:59.390 --> 00:38:03.500 align:middle line:84%
The trade-off is that you're
getting a more cohesive

00:38:03.500 --> 00:38:06.270 align:middle line:84%
male/female balance in
the child-rearing process

00:38:06.270 --> 00:38:08.387 align:middle line:84%
and sending maybe even
healthier signals--

00:38:08.387 --> 00:38:09.470 align:middle line:90%
>>CLOW: It could be, yeah.

00:38:09.470 --> 00:38:11.136 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: --to your
children, because we

00:38:11.136 --> 00:38:14.560 align:middle line:84%
are moving into a more
matriarchal paradigm.

00:38:14.560 --> 00:38:15.620 align:middle line:90%
So it would make sense.

00:38:15.620 --> 00:38:17.580 align:middle line:84%
But it's left so
many men so confused.

00:38:17.580 --> 00:38:20.940 align:middle line:84%
If they weren't already
confused between 38 and 46

00:38:20.940 --> 00:38:23.270 align:middle line:84%
and having some
issues, so to speak,

00:38:23.270 --> 00:38:26.570 align:middle line:84%
now you have this
overlay to it, and men

00:38:26.570 --> 00:38:29.110 align:middle line:84%
seem to be struggling
even more than women

00:38:29.110 --> 00:38:32.010 align:middle line:84%
right now with this whole
self identity and sexuality.

00:38:32.010 --> 00:38:33.260 align:middle line:90%
>>CLOW: Yes, I agree with you.

00:38:33.260 --> 00:38:36.605 align:middle line:84%
And then throw in sexual
enhancement drugs.

00:38:36.605 --> 00:38:37.230 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:38:37.230 --> 00:38:38.730 align:middle line:84%
>>CLOW: Because the
process that I'm

00:38:38.730 --> 00:38:43.610 align:middle line:84%
describing regarding the male
would be this natural energy

00:38:43.610 --> 00:38:45.350 align:middle line:90%
rising and the activation.

00:38:45.350 --> 00:38:47.830 align:middle line:84%
What happens ultimately,
if this works

00:38:47.830 --> 00:38:50.000 align:middle line:84%
as nature seems to
have intended it,

00:38:50.000 --> 00:38:53.380 align:middle line:84%
is a man will have
all chakras activated,

00:38:53.380 --> 00:38:55.130 align:middle line:84%
all the way up through
the crown chakra.

00:38:55.130 --> 00:38:58.830 align:middle line:84%
And then there simply is
no lack of phallic function

00:38:58.830 --> 00:39:01.410 align:middle line:84%
because the whole chakra
system is working.

00:39:01.410 --> 00:39:04.120 align:middle line:84%
And so many men, younger
men in particular,

00:39:04.120 --> 00:39:06.240 align:middle line:84%
as soon as they see
a kind of problem

00:39:06.240 --> 00:39:07.774 align:middle line:84%
are taking sexual
enhancement drugs.

00:39:07.774 --> 00:39:09.190 align:middle line:84%
And if you think
about it, they're

00:39:09.190 --> 00:39:11.712 align:middle line:84%
shutting down a natural
process of nature.

00:39:11.712 --> 00:39:12.670 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: This is true.

00:39:12.670 --> 00:39:14.490 align:middle line:84%
And just like the
gaining of wisdom.

00:39:14.490 --> 00:39:16.440 align:middle line:84%
I mean, I interview,
as you know,

00:39:16.440 --> 00:39:17.970 align:middle line:90%
hundreds and hundreds of people.

00:39:17.970 --> 00:39:20.880 align:middle line:84%
And oftentimes,
the people will be

00:39:20.880 --> 00:39:24.430 align:middle line:84%
inspired because they had this
blast open Kundalini experience

00:39:24.430 --> 00:39:27.000 align:middle line:84%
where everything was revealed
and the light flooded in,

00:39:27.000 --> 00:39:28.630 align:middle line:84%
and suddenly they
knew this and that

00:39:28.630 --> 00:39:30.230 align:middle line:84%
and started writing
books about it.

00:39:30.230 --> 00:39:31.855 align:middle line:84%
And there are times
I've thought, gosh,

00:39:31.855 --> 00:39:33.670 align:middle line:84%
I've never had that
happen like that.

00:39:33.670 --> 00:39:38.050 align:middle line:84%
But then I
acknowledged that it's

00:39:38.050 --> 00:39:41.540 align:middle line:84%
been a steady growth of
opening, and wisdom that's

00:39:41.540 --> 00:39:46.110 align:middle line:84%
been gained, over the decades to
where I feel quite functional.

00:39:46.110 --> 00:39:48.040 align:middle line:84%
I feel like
everything's flowing.

00:39:48.040 --> 00:39:50.930 align:middle line:84%
If I need or want inspiration,
information, and so forth,

00:39:50.930 --> 00:39:51.650 align:middle line:90%
it's right there.

00:39:51.650 --> 00:39:53.190 align:middle line:90%
But when did it happen?

00:39:53.190 --> 00:39:54.070 align:middle line:90%
I don't know.

00:39:54.070 --> 00:39:55.785 align:middle line:84%
It's a process over
decades of happening.

00:39:55.785 --> 00:39:56.660 align:middle line:90%
>>CLOW: That's right.

00:39:56.660 --> 00:39:57.040 align:middle line:90%
That's right.

00:39:57.040 --> 00:39:58.790 align:middle line:84%
And I think it's a
little easier that way.

00:39:58.790 --> 00:40:01.250 align:middle line:84%
People who have a quick
breakthrough or a near death

00:40:01.250 --> 00:40:02.750 align:middle line:84%
experience or
whatever they have,

00:40:02.750 --> 00:40:04.412 align:middle line:84%
it can be very, very
difficult, as you

00:40:04.412 --> 00:40:07.260 align:middle line:84%
know, from the spiritual
emergency point of view.

00:40:07.260 --> 00:40:07.860 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:40:07.860 --> 00:40:12.380 align:middle line:84%
Let's talk for a little bit
about the notion of Chiron

00:40:12.380 --> 00:40:13.490 align:middle line:90%
squares.

00:40:13.490 --> 00:40:15.180 align:middle line:90%
We alluded to it a bit ago.

00:40:15.180 --> 00:40:17.620 align:middle line:84%
And I was fascinated when I
saw that chapter in your book.

00:40:17.620 --> 00:40:18.670 align:middle line:90%
I thought oh, my god.

00:40:18.670 --> 00:40:21.550 align:middle line:84%
This really nails
at such an early age

00:40:21.550 --> 00:40:22.950 align:middle line:90%
what happens to people.

00:40:22.950 --> 00:40:25.130 align:middle line:84%
And you were saying that
that square can show up

00:40:25.130 --> 00:40:27.230 align:middle line:84%
as early as five
years old, or it

00:40:27.230 --> 00:40:29.220 align:middle line:84%
can show up in teens,
or in their 20s.

00:40:29.220 --> 00:40:32.450 align:middle line:84%
What happens, just give
us a thumbnail sketch

00:40:32.450 --> 00:40:35.950 align:middle line:84%
of the kind of
dynamic that's set up

00:40:35.950 --> 00:40:38.590 align:middle line:84%
when you have a very
early Chiron square,

00:40:38.590 --> 00:40:39.970 align:middle line:90%
say, five years old.

00:40:39.970 --> 00:40:40.670 align:middle line:90%
>>CLOW: OK.

00:40:40.670 --> 00:40:41.170 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:40:41.170 --> 00:40:43.930 align:middle line:84%
When you have an
early Chiron square,

00:40:43.930 --> 00:40:47.510 align:middle line:84%
you have an experience of
full bore illumination.

00:40:47.510 --> 00:40:50.400 align:middle line:84%
And it's so intense
and so subtle

00:40:50.400 --> 00:40:52.910 align:middle line:90%
that people don't remember.

00:40:52.910 --> 00:40:56.450 align:middle line:84%
I had it when I was
5 and 1/2 years old.

00:40:56.450 --> 00:40:58.880 align:middle line:84%
And I fell off of a
brick wall because I

00:40:58.880 --> 00:41:00.910 align:middle line:90%
was hit by this wave of energy.

00:41:00.910 --> 00:41:04.320 align:middle line:84%
And I had a full blown
Kundalini rising at that point

00:41:04.320 --> 00:41:08.310 align:middle line:84%
from this experience, which was
really intense and not so hot.

00:41:08.310 --> 00:41:10.570 align:middle line:84%
So people don't
necessarily remember it.

00:41:10.570 --> 00:41:14.690 align:middle line:84%
Also, another thing, Regina, is
that often death is a teacher.

00:41:14.690 --> 00:41:16.630 align:middle line:84%
And there's a very
strong tendency, also,

00:41:16.630 --> 00:41:19.460 align:middle line:84%
for people to experience
the death of a relative

00:41:19.460 --> 00:41:22.050 align:middle line:84%
or a close person in their
lives at one of the squares

00:41:22.050 --> 00:41:24.389 align:middle line:84%
or oppositions or
the upper square.

00:41:24.389 --> 00:41:26.930 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And sometimes you were
saying that at a certain age

00:41:26.930 --> 00:41:30.370 align:middle line:84%
it leaves the person
living really blasted open

00:41:30.370 --> 00:41:32.865 align:middle line:84%
into a spiritual reality
that they don't understand

00:41:32.865 --> 00:41:35.120 align:middle line:84%
and can't navigate, with
very little connection

00:41:35.120 --> 00:41:36.340 align:middle line:90%
to the physical world.

00:41:36.340 --> 00:41:38.282 align:middle line:84%
Now, is that at,
say, at that age,

00:41:38.282 --> 00:41:39.740 align:middle line:84%
or is that more at
a pubescent age?

00:41:39.740 --> 00:41:41.170 align:middle line:84%
What happens if it
happens at pubescence?

00:41:41.170 --> 00:41:43.390 align:middle line:84%
>>CLOW: The younger the
person is, the more likely

00:41:43.390 --> 00:41:46.210 align:middle line:84%
they're going to be
to be blown fully open

00:41:46.210 --> 00:41:49.170 align:middle line:84%
and then have difficulty
navigating reality.

00:41:49.170 --> 00:41:53.350 align:middle line:84%
The youngest you can have first
Chiron square is age 5 and 1/2,

00:41:53.350 --> 00:41:55.080 align:middle line:90%
and the oldest is age 23.

00:41:55.080 --> 00:41:57.330 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: What happens if
you're in a pubescent stage?

00:41:57.330 --> 00:41:58.955 align:middle line:84%
>>CLOW: If you're in
a pubescent stage,

00:41:58.955 --> 00:42:00.890 align:middle line:84%
you know how puberty
is to begin with.

00:42:00.890 --> 00:42:05.000 align:middle line:84%
Puberty always represents a
lot of Kundalini rising energy.

00:42:05.000 --> 00:42:07.150 align:middle line:84%
It's not like the full
bore at midlife crisis,

00:42:07.150 --> 00:42:10.570 align:middle line:84%
but it's very strong when the
hormonal sequencing starts

00:42:10.570 --> 00:42:11.590 align:middle line:90%
to occur.

00:42:11.590 --> 00:42:14.470 align:middle line:84%
And so if it combines with
a spiritual breakthrough

00:42:14.470 --> 00:42:16.870 align:middle line:90%
like that, it can be wonderful.

00:42:16.870 --> 00:42:18.400 align:middle line:84%
But it can also
be pretty intense.

00:42:18.400 --> 00:42:18.890 align:middle line:90%
So all of the things--

00:42:18.890 --> 00:42:19.000 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Body issues--

00:42:19.000 --> 00:42:20.130 align:middle line:90%
>>CLOW: --we're talking about--

00:42:20.130 --> 00:42:21.880 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: --self hatred
issues of the body

00:42:21.880 --> 00:42:23.838 align:middle line:84%
can happen at that time,
even more so, right?

00:42:23.838 --> 00:42:24.546 align:middle line:90%
>>CLOW: Oh, sure.

00:42:24.546 --> 00:42:25.360 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:42:25.360 --> 00:42:27.240 align:middle line:84%
So the wonderful
thing about knowing

00:42:27.240 --> 00:42:29.942 align:middle line:84%
about the timing, and the
book has charts at the end,

00:42:29.942 --> 00:42:32.150 align:middle line:84%
so you can figure out when
you had that first square.

00:42:32.150 --> 00:42:33.181 align:middle line:90%
Did you check that out?

00:42:33.181 --> 00:42:33.680 align:middle line:90%
Did it--

00:42:33.680 --> 00:42:34.100 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: I did.

00:42:34.100 --> 00:42:35.058 align:middle line:90%
I checked other things.

00:42:35.058 --> 00:42:37.300 align:middle line:84%
But I just read that
part, I happened

00:42:37.300 --> 00:42:39.272 align:middle line:90%
to read that part this morning.

00:42:39.272 --> 00:42:40.980 align:middle line:84%
>>CLOW: You can go to
the end of the book

00:42:40.980 --> 00:42:44.570 align:middle line:84%
and it'll tell when you had
your first square, because it

00:42:44.570 --> 00:42:45.790 align:middle line:90%
varies so radically.

00:42:45.790 --> 00:42:49.630 align:middle line:84%
So one of the things I did
in the book is traditionally,

00:42:49.630 --> 00:42:52.240 align:middle line:84%
people usually had their
children in their 20s.

00:42:52.240 --> 00:42:54.340 align:middle line:84%
And so what would happen
with these patterns

00:42:54.340 --> 00:42:57.430 align:middle line:84%
would be that parents
would have a kid who

00:42:57.430 --> 00:42:59.620 align:middle line:84%
had a Chiron square,
first square, that

00:42:59.620 --> 00:43:01.960 align:middle line:84%
was radically
different from theirs.

00:43:01.960 --> 00:43:05.110 align:middle line:84%
But the grandparents
of that child

00:43:05.110 --> 00:43:07.570 align:middle line:90%
would have the same pattern.

00:43:07.570 --> 00:43:09.630 align:middle line:84%
And so, what goes
on is this explains

00:43:09.630 --> 00:43:12.180 align:middle line:84%
why the grandparents often
have such a great influence

00:43:12.180 --> 00:43:12.725 align:middle line:90%
on the child.

00:43:12.725 --> 00:43:13.300 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: That's what I
was going to get to next.

00:43:13.300 --> 00:43:14.966 align:middle line:84%
>>CLOW: But the parents
have a conflict.

00:43:14.966 --> 00:43:15.860 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:43:15.860 --> 00:43:18.620 align:middle line:84%
And so that radical
differential creates

00:43:18.620 --> 00:43:20.450 align:middle line:90%
a lot of generational stress.

00:43:20.450 --> 00:43:23.950 align:middle line:84%
But then if you think about it,
because it changes so much in a

00:43:23.950 --> 00:43:26.540 align:middle line:84%
give-- this is another
reason for these peer group

00:43:26.540 --> 00:43:29.130 align:middle line:84%
issues, where people
are having their Saturn

00:43:29.130 --> 00:43:31.590 align:middle line:84%
return at the same age,
they're having midlife crisis.

00:43:31.590 --> 00:43:33.800 align:middle line:84%
People, in a given
year, are having

00:43:33.800 --> 00:43:37.860 align:middle line:84%
all of these key passages
happening at the same time.

00:43:37.860 --> 00:43:39.970 align:middle line:84%
And this is why we have
to strong relationship

00:43:39.970 --> 00:43:41.194 align:middle line:90%
with people our own age.

00:43:41.194 --> 00:43:41.860 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:43:41.860 --> 00:43:43.514 align:middle line:84%
Because you can
relate to this impulse

00:43:43.514 --> 00:43:45.180 align:middle line:84%
passing through all
of you collectively.

00:43:45.180 --> 00:43:47.430 align:middle line:84%
>>CLOW: You can say, hey,
did that happen to you, too?

00:43:47.430 --> 00:43:49.659 align:middle line:90%
And the person will say, yeah.

00:43:49.659 --> 00:43:50.200 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: OK.

00:43:50.200 --> 00:43:53.730 align:middle line:84%
Now, we have, oh, about
five minutes left or so.

00:43:53.730 --> 00:43:57.190 align:middle line:84%
Can you just talk a little bit
about what you just brought up,

00:43:57.190 --> 00:43:59.680 align:middle line:84%
the need to have
multi-generational influences

00:43:59.680 --> 00:44:03.374 align:middle line:84%
and grandparents in
the scene for children.

00:44:03.374 --> 00:44:05.290 align:middle line:84%
>>CLOW: Well, this pattern
I was talking about

00:44:05.290 --> 00:44:08.275 align:middle line:84%
has changed so radically now,
because so many women now

00:44:08.275 --> 00:44:10.320 align:middle line:84%
are having their children
in their late 30s,

00:44:10.320 --> 00:44:12.180 align:middle line:90%
and into the early 40s.

00:44:12.180 --> 00:44:13.766 align:middle line:84%
And what's happening,
first of all,

00:44:13.766 --> 00:44:16.140 align:middle line:84%
is they're having their children
right at midlife crisis,

00:44:16.140 --> 00:44:18.020 align:middle line:90%
just when they're stressed out.

00:44:18.020 --> 00:44:20.590 align:middle line:84%
And then, to tell you the
truth, their mothers and fathers

00:44:20.590 --> 00:44:22.910 align:middle line:84%
are in their late
60s and late 70s--

00:44:22.910 --> 00:44:23.970 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: They're
devitalizing a bit sometimes.

00:44:23.970 --> 00:44:25.511 align:middle line:84%
>>CLOW: And aren't
as likely--- Yeah,

00:44:25.511 --> 00:44:27.620 align:middle line:84%
they aren't as likely to
want to be grandparents.

00:44:27.620 --> 00:44:30.450 align:middle line:84%
And so I think we're going
through a whole revolution

00:44:30.450 --> 00:44:33.100 align:middle line:84%
here in what's going
to be happening.

00:44:33.100 --> 00:44:35.360 align:middle line:84%
And then the positive side
of that would be people

00:44:35.360 --> 00:44:37.630 align:middle line:84%
are having so many
less children,

00:44:37.630 --> 00:44:39.900 align:middle line:84%
that when a child
does finally come,

00:44:39.900 --> 00:44:41.590 align:middle line:84%
usually there's so
many relatives that

00:44:41.590 --> 00:44:44.006 align:middle line:84%
relate to that child, that at
least that child isn't going

00:44:44.006 --> 00:44:46.395 align:middle line:84%
to be abandoned by the
family, for the most part.

00:44:46.395 --> 00:44:47.020 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:44:47.020 --> 00:44:49.740 align:middle line:84%
Because it needs that
correlative energy

00:44:49.740 --> 00:44:52.025 align:middle line:84%
on the other side
of Saturn-- I mean

00:44:52.025 --> 00:44:54.010 align:middle line:84%
on the other side
of Chiron, right?

00:44:54.010 --> 00:44:54.989 align:middle line:90%
>>CLOW: Yeah.

00:44:54.989 --> 00:44:56.280 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: And that wisdom, too.

00:44:56.280 --> 00:44:58.587 align:middle line:84%
And that's lost a lot
anyway in our culture when

00:44:58.587 --> 00:44:59.060 align:middle line:90%
people aren't multigenerational.

00:44:59.060 --> 00:45:01.393 align:middle line:84%
>>CLOW: And once people have
gone through Chiron return,

00:45:01.393 --> 00:45:03.480 align:middle line:84%
they're moving
into their mid 50s.

00:45:03.480 --> 00:45:05.390 align:middle line:90%
They're becoming wisdom figures.

00:45:05.390 --> 00:45:08.800 align:middle line:84%
And so that's why that decision
at second Saturn return at age

00:45:08.800 --> 00:45:10.400 align:middle line:90%
58 is so critical.

00:45:10.400 --> 00:45:12.296 align:middle line:84%
Because there you
are, and you've

00:45:12.296 --> 00:45:13.920 align:middle line:84%
broken through a lot
of things, and you

00:45:13.920 --> 00:45:15.910 align:middle line:90%
are becoming a wisdom figure.

00:45:15.910 --> 00:45:19.010 align:middle line:84%
So the question is OK, how can
I take all of this knowledge

00:45:19.010 --> 00:45:22.160 align:middle line:84%
that I have now and
how can I give it back.

00:45:22.160 --> 00:45:24.110 align:middle line:84%
And I think with the
boomer generation,

00:45:24.110 --> 00:45:26.100 align:middle line:84%
in particular, that's
a very important issue.

00:45:26.100 --> 00:45:29.110 align:middle line:84%
Because the boomer generation
wants to give back.

00:45:29.110 --> 00:45:31.340 align:middle line:84%
The issue for us
in our lifetimes

00:45:31.340 --> 00:45:33.974 align:middle line:84%
has been emotional
development and giving back.

00:45:33.974 --> 00:45:36.390 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: What about the time,
and now we've gone through,

00:45:36.390 --> 00:45:38.930 align:middle line:84%
say you've made it to your
third Saturn return, which

00:45:38.930 --> 00:45:41.110 align:middle line:90%
we agreed was around 87 or so.

00:45:41.110 --> 00:45:44.660 align:middle line:84%
But that period of life, do
you believe that our expiration

00:45:44.660 --> 00:45:49.230 align:middle line:84%
date is set in our
astrology, so to speak, just

00:45:49.230 --> 00:45:51.460 align:middle line:90%
like the rest of our template?

00:45:51.460 --> 00:45:53.620 align:middle line:84%
When we're born, does
our soul choose this--

00:45:53.620 --> 00:45:54.120 align:middle line:90%
>>CLOW: Yes.

00:45:54.120 --> 00:45:54.940 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: --beginning to end?

00:45:54.940 --> 00:45:57.810 align:middle line:84%
>>CLOW: And astrologers can read
the death date for a person,

00:45:57.810 --> 00:45:58.310 align:middle line:90%
by the way.

00:45:58.310 --> 00:46:00.722 align:middle line:84%
And we're proscribed
from doing that.

00:46:00.722 --> 00:46:02.555 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Yeah, well
it's good not to do it.

00:46:02.555 --> 00:46:03.096 align:middle line:90%
>>CLOW: Yeah.

00:46:03.096 --> 00:46:05.210 align:middle line:84%
And one of the ideal
points, and then there's

00:46:05.210 --> 00:46:08.260 align:middle line:84%
another whole issue here with
people keeping people alive

00:46:08.260 --> 00:46:10.810 align:middle line:84%
with allopathic medicine,
because actually,

00:46:10.810 --> 00:46:13.140 align:middle line:84%
one of the most
ideal times to die

00:46:13.140 --> 00:46:16.550 align:middle line:84%
is around 82 to 84
or 85 years old.

00:46:16.550 --> 00:46:20.290 align:middle line:84%
And the reason for that is
that that's Uranus return.

00:46:20.290 --> 00:46:22.310 align:middle line:84%
So Uranus has gone
halfway around

00:46:22.310 --> 00:46:23.940 align:middle line:90%
and you've had midlife crisis.

00:46:23.940 --> 00:46:27.680 align:middle line:84%
And then it takes Uranus 84
years to go around the sun.

00:46:27.680 --> 00:46:29.645 align:middle line:84%
So Uranus is the planet
of transformation.

00:46:29.645 --> 00:46:32.680 align:middle line:84%
And it's the planet of
triggering illumination

00:46:32.680 --> 00:46:33.840 align:middle line:90%
in our consciousness.

00:46:33.840 --> 00:46:36.860 align:middle line:84%
So when it returns to
its birth location,

00:46:36.860 --> 00:46:39.020 align:middle line:84%
just like with
Saturn return, that's

00:46:39.020 --> 00:46:42.400 align:middle line:84%
the point where we can just
move into full bore illumination

00:46:42.400 --> 00:46:43.700 align:middle line:90%
and mysticism.

00:46:43.700 --> 00:46:46.880 align:middle line:84%
And I can tell you one
thing, if I make it to 84,

00:46:46.880 --> 00:46:49.520 align:middle line:84%
and I'm 71 now, if
I make it to 84,

00:46:49.520 --> 00:46:52.020 align:middle line:84%
nobody's doing anything
to me after that.

00:46:52.020 --> 00:46:55.210 align:middle line:84%
I think that for
people to interfere

00:46:55.210 --> 00:46:57.610 align:middle line:84%
with natural processes
past that point

00:46:57.610 --> 00:46:59.290 align:middle line:90%
is very, very destructive.

00:46:59.290 --> 00:47:00.820 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: On so many levels.

00:47:00.820 --> 00:47:01.910 align:middle line:90%
>>CLOW: Yeah.

00:47:01.910 --> 00:47:03.256 align:middle line:90%
On all levels.

00:47:03.256 --> 00:47:04.630 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So many--
and thank you

00:47:04.630 --> 00:47:06.850 align:middle line:84%
so much for sharing
that piece of it.

00:47:06.850 --> 00:47:08.970 align:middle line:84%
That does seem to me
to be really critical,

00:47:08.970 --> 00:47:10.850 align:middle line:84%
as I watch people
go into these years.

00:47:10.850 --> 00:47:14.260 align:middle line:84%
You can feel when there's a
desire to start letting go.

00:47:14.260 --> 00:47:18.270 align:middle line:84%
The re-examination of the past,
maybe love being expressed,

00:47:18.270 --> 00:47:19.632 align:middle line:90%
and a time to move on.

00:47:19.632 --> 00:47:21.090 align:middle line:84%
And this just
happened with my aunt

00:47:21.090 --> 00:47:23.390 align:middle line:84%
who died about a
week and a half ago.

00:47:23.390 --> 00:47:26.840 align:middle line:84%
Last of that generation on my
mother's side, and her body

00:47:26.840 --> 00:47:30.910 align:middle line:84%
was just kept going, rushing to
the ER over two, three years,

00:47:30.910 --> 00:47:34.319 align:middle line:84%
again and again, when
she had made her peace.

00:47:34.319 --> 00:47:34.860 align:middle line:90%
>>CLOW: Yeah.

00:47:34.860 --> 00:47:37.220 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And it was so painful
for her and everyone else.

00:47:37.220 --> 00:47:37.761 align:middle line:90%
>>CLOW: Yeah.

00:47:37.761 --> 00:47:39.930 align:middle line:84%
And people go to the
doctor three days

00:47:39.930 --> 00:47:43.310 align:middle line:84%
a week at that age, when they
should be at home looking out

00:47:43.310 --> 00:47:45.140 align:middle line:90%
the window at the trees.

00:47:45.140 --> 00:47:47.740 align:middle line:84%
And then think of
third Saturn return.

00:47:47.740 --> 00:47:49.430 align:middle line:84%
When you get to
third Saturn return,

00:47:49.430 --> 00:47:51.350 align:middle line:84%
you don't want to create
a whole new reality.

00:47:51.350 --> 00:47:51.891 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: No.

00:47:51.891 --> 00:47:53.298 align:middle line:90%
At 87?

00:47:53.298 --> 00:47:54.673 align:middle line:84%
Not most people,
that's for sure.

00:47:54.673 --> 00:47:56.173 align:middle line:84%
>>CLOW: And I have
been lucky enough

00:47:56.173 --> 00:47:58.850 align:middle line:84%
to have some elders in the
family who lived to almost 100,

00:47:58.850 --> 00:48:00.930 align:middle line:84%
and it's been a
wonderful experience.

00:48:00.930 --> 00:48:02.840 align:middle line:84%
But none of them
interfered with nature.

00:48:02.840 --> 00:48:05.680 align:middle line:84%
They just let the
natural processes go.

00:48:05.680 --> 00:48:08.470 align:middle line:84%
So I hope with this kind
of transit information,

00:48:08.470 --> 00:48:10.470 align:middle line:84%
I hope finally we're going
to come to that point

00:48:10.470 --> 00:48:12.650 align:middle line:84%
