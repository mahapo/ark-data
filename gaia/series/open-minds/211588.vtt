00:00:08.600 --> 00:00:10.600 align:middle line:84%
>>MERCEDES ARNÚS-ARRAUT:
I gave a reading to one

00:00:10.600 --> 00:00:15.040 align:middle line:84%
of my professors of her entire
life, and she was mind blown.

00:00:15.040 --> 00:00:17.800 align:middle line:84%
And she was like, the
most Catholic of them all.

00:00:17.800 --> 00:00:20.980 align:middle line:84%
We've entered into
an age of air,

00:00:20.980 --> 00:00:25.000 align:middle line:84%
and we're learning to
understand air, which

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:27.610 align:middle line:90%
is the power of our minds.

00:00:27.610 --> 00:00:29.530 align:middle line:84%
Astrology, to me,
is very intuitive.

00:00:29.530 --> 00:00:31.690 align:middle line:84%
Like, once you know the
codes and the patterns

00:00:31.690 --> 00:00:34.780 align:middle line:84%
and the meanings of each
planet, each sign, each house,

00:00:34.780 --> 00:00:38.590 align:middle line:84%
it's like reading a
map or reading a soul.

00:00:38.590 --> 00:00:43.990 align:middle line:84%
This pattern is not
going to limit your life.

00:00:43.990 --> 00:00:47.590 align:middle line:84%
It comes to guide you
to awaken in this life.

00:00:47.590 --> 00:00:50.110 align:middle line:84%
I know a lot of people who
are very scared nowadays

00:00:50.110 --> 00:00:54.040 align:middle line:84%
of technology and AI,
and in a way, that's

00:00:54.040 --> 00:00:55.750 align:middle line:90%
Pluto and Aquarius for us.

00:00:55.750 --> 00:00:59.710 align:middle line:90%


00:00:59.710 --> 00:01:02.530 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA MEREDITH: Some people
are born to read the stars.

00:01:02.530 --> 00:01:05.920 align:middle line:10%
Mercedes Aranús began
reading them at age 15.

00:01:05.920 --> 00:01:08.370 align:middle line:10%
Her passion is to combine
astrology with dream work

00:01:08.370 --> 00:01:09.170 align:middle line:10%
as well.

00:01:09.170 --> 00:01:12.270 align:middle line:84%
And so she says that's the path
to ordering our daily lives.

00:01:12.270 --> 00:01:14.770 align:middle line:84%
But we're going to get into a
lot more than our daily lives.

00:01:14.770 --> 00:01:15.595 align:middle line:90%
Welcome, Mercedes.

00:01:15.595 --> 00:01:16.030 align:middle line:90%
>> ARNÚS-ARRAUT: Hi, Regina.

00:01:16.030 --> 00:01:18.490 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: We've been having
a blast talking off camera,

00:01:18.490 --> 00:01:21.400 align:middle line:84%
because one of the areas
I really want to get into

00:01:21.400 --> 00:01:24.220 align:middle line:90%
is generational astrology.

00:01:24.220 --> 00:01:25.690 align:middle line:84%
Because that's
kind of a pop theme

00:01:25.690 --> 00:01:28.030 align:middle line:84%
right now, because you
see it in headlines.

00:01:28.030 --> 00:01:31.780 align:middle line:84%
I mean, Gen Z, Millennials,
Boomers, everybody

00:01:31.780 --> 00:01:34.400 align:middle line:84%
blaming and pointing
fingers at each other.

00:01:34.400 --> 00:01:36.370 align:middle line:84%
And I think it's
just another source

00:01:36.370 --> 00:01:37.810 align:middle line:90%
of division at the moment.

00:01:37.810 --> 00:01:40.510 align:middle line:84%
And I thought we would
get into allowing people

00:01:40.510 --> 00:01:42.700 align:middle line:84%
a deeper understanding
of the beauty of each

00:01:42.700 --> 00:01:45.310 align:middle line:84%
of these generations and
some of the challenges.

00:01:45.310 --> 00:01:47.380 align:middle line:84%
But first, let's talk
about you, because you've

00:01:47.380 --> 00:01:49.930 align:middle line:84%
been in astrology
since you were a kid.

00:01:49.930 --> 00:01:51.460 align:middle line:90%
So how did you--

00:01:51.460 --> 00:01:54.160 align:middle line:84%
how did your fascination
with astrol--

00:01:54.160 --> 00:01:55.690 align:middle line:84%
without going into
past life stuff,

00:01:55.690 --> 00:01:58.090 align:middle line:84%
how did your association
with astrology

00:01:58.090 --> 00:02:00.280 align:middle line:90%
begin as a young girl?

00:02:00.280 --> 00:02:03.250 align:middle line:10%
>> ARNÚS-ARRAUT: So, yeah,
at the age of 15, in school,

00:02:03.250 --> 00:02:06.400 align:middle line:10%
we were asked to just
choose a project,

00:02:06.400 --> 00:02:09.190 align:middle line:10%
just choose something that
we loved and that we wanted

00:02:09.190 --> 00:02:11.310 align:middle line:10%
to work on for an entire year.

00:02:11.310 --> 00:02:13.060 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Wait, this
is in regular school?

00:02:13.060 --> 00:02:14.200 align:middle line:84%
>> ARNÚS-ARRAUT: Yeah,
my regular school.

00:02:14.200 --> 00:02:15.070 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: They let
you choose anything?

00:02:15.070 --> 00:02:17.860 align:middle line:84%
>> ARNÚS-ARRAUT: And I actually
went to a Catholic school.

00:02:17.860 --> 00:02:18.250 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:02:18.250 --> 00:02:19.010 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Oh, I love it.

00:02:19.010 --> 00:02:21.290 align:middle line:10%
>> ARNÚS-ARRAUT: So at
the age of 15, I was like,

00:02:21.290 --> 00:02:25.150 align:middle line:10%
I need to do something, and I
need to choose something that

00:02:25.150 --> 00:02:30.250 align:middle line:10%
I'm so passionate into that I
can work and I cannot get bored

00:02:30.250 --> 00:02:32.720 align:middle line:10%
about it for an entire year.

00:02:32.720 --> 00:02:34.810 align:middle line:90%
So I chose astrology.

00:02:34.810 --> 00:02:39.310 align:middle line:84%
Because I grew up in
like, a very spiritually

00:02:39.310 --> 00:02:40.580 align:middle line:90%
awakened family.

00:02:40.580 --> 00:02:43.300 align:middle line:84%
So my parents had a
free meditation center,

00:02:43.300 --> 00:02:47.590 align:middle line:84%
so I grew up with meditation,
astrology, astronomy.

00:02:47.590 --> 00:02:48.700 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: And Catholicism.

00:02:48.700 --> 00:02:48.797 align:middle line:90%


00:02:48.797 --> 00:02:49.840 align:middle line:84%
>> ARNÚS-ARRAUT:
Yeah, Catholicism,

00:02:49.840 --> 00:02:51.310 align:middle line:84%
which was my
mother's background.

00:02:51.310 --> 00:02:54.080 align:middle line:90%
But anyway, my family--

00:02:54.080 --> 00:02:56.440 align:middle line:84%
my parents were already
starting to transcend that,

00:02:56.440 --> 00:02:58.250 align:middle line:84%
but yet, I was in
a Catholic school.

00:02:58.250 --> 00:03:01.540 align:middle line:84%
So I had a little bit of
a background in astrology,

00:03:01.540 --> 00:03:03.740 align:middle line:90%
but I was not so much into it.

00:03:03.740 --> 00:03:06.890 align:middle line:84%
But I chose that as a
topic for my school.

00:03:06.890 --> 00:03:07.690 align:middle line:90%
And then--

00:03:07.690 --> 00:03:09.970 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: First of all, how did
the sisters feel about that?

00:03:09.970 --> 00:03:11.140 align:middle line:90%
>> ARNÚS-ARRAUT: Oh, absolutely.

00:03:11.140 --> 00:03:12.400 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: I wanna
hear that story.

00:03:12.400 --> 00:03:13.270 align:middle line:90%
>> ARNÚS-ARRAUT: I know.

00:03:13.270 --> 00:03:14.070 align:middle line:90%
I know.

00:03:14.070 --> 00:03:15.880 align:middle line:90%
So everyone was freaking out.

00:03:15.880 --> 00:03:17.482 align:middle line:90%
There were nuns-- nuns--

00:03:17.482 --> 00:03:18.440 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: I'm assuming.

00:03:18.440 --> 00:03:18.475 align:middle line:90%


00:03:18.475 --> 00:03:19.340 align:middle line:90%
>> ARNÚS-ARRAUT: --in my school.

00:03:19.340 --> 00:03:20.140 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:03:20.140 --> 00:03:24.160 align:middle line:84%
>> ARNÚS-ARRAUT: So every nun or
every teacher was sort of like,

00:03:24.160 --> 00:03:27.400 align:middle line:84%
supervising each
student with that topic.

00:03:27.400 --> 00:03:29.870 align:middle line:84%
Because at the
end of the course,

00:03:29.870 --> 00:03:33.160 align:middle line:84%
you had to give an entire
presentation about that topic

00:03:33.160 --> 00:03:34.030 align:middle line:90%
to sort of like--

00:03:34.030 --> 00:03:36.460 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Were they holding
up garlic and rosaries

00:03:36.460 --> 00:03:37.462 align:middle line:90%
when you did yours?

00:03:37.462 --> 00:03:38.920 align:middle line:84%
>> ARNÚS-ARRAUT:
Yeah, pretty much.

00:03:38.920 --> 00:03:40.630 align:middle line:90%
I was like, very judged.

00:03:40.630 --> 00:03:42.880 align:middle line:84%
Because at that
time, especially,

00:03:42.880 --> 00:03:45.700 align:middle line:84%
was like, oh, she's
like, a big freak.

00:03:45.700 --> 00:03:47.140 align:middle line:90%
That's very weird.

00:03:47.140 --> 00:03:50.290 align:middle line:84%
But in order to provide
for a whole year

00:03:50.290 --> 00:03:53.710 align:middle line:84%
content of information,
I had a teacher.

00:03:53.710 --> 00:03:55.750 align:middle line:84%
I had like, my own
personal teacher.

00:03:55.750 --> 00:03:57.940 align:middle line:84%
And then, I joined
an Astrology Academy.

00:03:57.940 --> 00:03:59.680 align:middle line:90%
This was at the age of 15.

00:03:59.680 --> 00:04:03.550 align:middle line:84%
So by the age 16, I
finished up my project.

00:04:03.550 --> 00:04:06.610 align:middle line:84%
I did an entire
presentation of astrology

00:04:06.610 --> 00:04:10.940 align:middle line:84%
in front of like, the whole
teachers, nuns, and well,

00:04:10.940 --> 00:04:11.740 align:middle line:90%
tribune.

00:04:11.740 --> 00:04:11.830 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:04:11.830 --> 00:04:13.300 align:middle line:90%
I'm trying to feel on into that.

00:04:13.300 --> 00:04:14.100 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:04:14.100 --> 00:04:16.260 align:middle line:90%
And how was it received?

00:04:16.260 --> 00:04:17.260 align:middle line:90%
>> ARNÚS-ARRAUT: I got--

00:04:17.260 --> 00:04:19.430 align:middle line:90%
I was graduated with honors.

00:04:19.430 --> 00:04:21.279 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So they're
open-minded enough

00:04:21.279 --> 00:04:23.770 align:middle line:84%
to see the validity and the
hard work that you'd put in.

00:04:23.770 --> 00:04:25.270 align:middle line:84%
>> ARNÚS-ARRAUT:
Well, you know why?

00:04:25.270 --> 00:04:28.270 align:middle line:84%
Because I did-- like,
part of the project

00:04:28.270 --> 00:04:31.690 align:middle line:84%
was to give a reading
to the teachers.

00:04:31.690 --> 00:04:32.710 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Oh, smart.

00:04:32.710 --> 00:04:33.040 align:middle line:90%
>> ARNÚS-ARRAUT: Yeah.

00:04:33.040 --> 00:04:33.610 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: I love it.

00:04:33.610 --> 00:04:34.943 align:middle line:90%
>> ARNÚS-ARRAUT: So I give the--

00:04:34.943 --> 00:04:38.140 align:middle line:84%
I give a-- I gave a reading
to one of my professors,

00:04:38.140 --> 00:04:41.090 align:middle line:84%
an actual chart reading
of her entire life,

00:04:41.090 --> 00:04:43.000 align:middle line:90%
and she was mind blown.

00:04:43.000 --> 00:04:46.210 align:middle line:84%
And she was like, the
most Catholic of them all.

00:04:46.210 --> 00:04:47.120 align:middle line:90%
The most Catholic.

00:04:47.120 --> 00:04:48.460 align:middle line:90%
She was mind blown.

00:04:48.460 --> 00:04:49.510 align:middle line:90%
Mind blown.

00:04:49.510 --> 00:04:51.010 align:middle line:90%
And it's like, one of my--

00:04:51.010 --> 00:04:53.260 align:middle line:84%
the best astral chart
reading or one of the best--

00:04:53.260 --> 00:04:54.670 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Probably one
of the greatest moments

00:04:54.670 --> 00:04:55.712 align:middle line:90%
of your life to this day.

00:04:55.712 --> 00:04:56.587 align:middle line:90%
>> ARNÚS-ARRAUT: Yes.

00:04:56.587 --> 00:04:59.050 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: To be able to prove
to all of these doubters

00:04:59.050 --> 00:05:01.210 align:middle line:90%
and non-believers in astrology.

00:05:01.210 --> 00:05:03.940 align:middle line:90%
And so did that give you--

00:05:03.940 --> 00:05:06.100 align:middle line:84%
did you feel kind of
accepted after that

00:05:06.100 --> 00:05:07.713 align:middle line:84%
in terms of the
world of astrology

00:05:07.713 --> 00:05:09.130 align:middle line:84%
and what you brought
to the table?

00:05:09.130 --> 00:05:10.000 align:middle line:90%
>> ARNÚS-ARRAUT: Absolutely.

00:05:10.000 --> 00:05:10.800 align:middle line:90%
100%.

00:05:10.800 --> 00:05:13.210 align:middle line:84%
I was like, OK, I'm
doing something right.

00:05:13.210 --> 00:05:16.270 align:middle line:84%
Especially because I got
graduated with honors

00:05:16.270 --> 00:05:18.770 align:middle line:90%
because of that project.

00:05:18.770 --> 00:05:20.682 align:middle line:84%
So I was like, OK,
this is my path.

00:05:20.682 --> 00:05:22.390 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: This is what
you're here to do.

00:05:22.390 --> 00:05:23.350 align:middle line:84%
>> ARNÚS-ARRAUT: This
is what I'm here to do.

00:05:23.350 --> 00:05:24.150 align:middle line:90%
This is my route.

00:05:24.150 --> 00:05:27.130 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So how long
before you started

00:05:27.130 --> 00:05:29.260 align:middle line:84%
using it to read other
people, and then,

00:05:29.260 --> 00:05:31.375 align:middle line:90%
ultimately, becoming a reader?

00:05:31.375 --> 00:05:33.532 align:middle line:90%


00:05:33.532 --> 00:05:35.240 align:middle line:84%
>> ARNÚS-ARRAUT: That's
a rough question,

00:05:35.240 --> 00:05:36.710 align:middle line:84%
because I feel I've
been a reader--

00:05:36.710 --> 00:05:37.250 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Since then?

00:05:37.250 --> 00:05:38.180 align:middle line:84%
>> ARNÚS-ARRAUT: --my
entire life, yeah.

00:05:38.180 --> 00:05:39.210 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Since then.

00:05:39.210 --> 00:05:41.210 align:middle line:84%
>> ARNÚS-ARRAUT: Because
astrology to me is very

00:05:41.210 --> 00:05:42.010 align:middle line:90%
intuitive.

00:05:42.010 --> 00:05:43.940 align:middle line:84%
Like, once you know the
codes and the patterns

00:05:43.940 --> 00:05:47.120 align:middle line:84%
and the meanings of each
planet, each sign, each house,

00:05:47.120 --> 00:05:51.860 align:middle line:84%
each connection in between the
planets is like reading a map

00:05:51.860 --> 00:05:53.390 align:middle line:90%
or reading a soul.

00:05:53.390 --> 00:05:55.970 align:middle line:84%
So you're reading a
soul's journey, just based

00:05:55.970 --> 00:05:59.000 align:middle line:84%
on looking at a graphic,
which is like a map.

00:05:59.000 --> 00:06:02.630 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Well, and
clearly, someone like you,

00:06:02.630 --> 00:06:04.250 align:middle line:90%
you're not dabbling.

00:06:04.250 --> 00:06:07.370 align:middle line:84%
You are doing this from
your own soul's level.

00:06:07.370 --> 00:06:09.170 align:middle line:90%
And I would guess that you--

00:06:09.170 --> 00:06:12.290 align:middle line:84%
aside from being able to
technically read the charts,

00:06:12.290 --> 00:06:15.630 align:middle line:84%
you bring a fair amount
of intuition to the table.

00:06:15.630 --> 00:06:17.630 align:middle line:84%
>> ARNÚS-ARRAUT: It's
pure intuition, I'd say.

00:06:17.630 --> 00:06:18.680 align:middle line:90%
It's pure intuition.

00:06:18.680 --> 00:06:20.960 align:middle line:84%
I'd say it's like
a 5% knowledge,

00:06:20.960 --> 00:06:25.790 align:middle line:84%
and a 95% of pure
intuition, and I'd say love.

00:06:25.790 --> 00:06:27.890 align:middle line:84%
Like, it's moving
through the map

00:06:27.890 --> 00:06:31.400 align:middle line:84%
with love, because you wanna
guide the person that you're

00:06:31.400 --> 00:06:34.940 align:middle line:84%
working with or that you're
reading for with your biggest

00:06:34.940 --> 00:06:36.050 align:middle line:90%
and brightest heart.

00:06:36.050 --> 00:06:40.130 align:middle line:84%
Like, you just want them to
feel that they're amazing,

00:06:40.130 --> 00:06:41.790 align:middle line:90%
that they chose this.

00:06:41.790 --> 00:06:43.040 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: That's the key part.

00:06:43.040 --> 00:06:46.370 align:middle line:84%
That's where I wanna start in
this part of the technical part

00:06:46.370 --> 00:06:49.070 align:middle line:84%
of the conversation, is
that they chose this.

00:06:49.070 --> 00:06:52.310 align:middle line:84%
Because so many people
I know, the perception

00:06:52.310 --> 00:06:53.690 align:middle line:90%
is times are challenging.

00:06:53.690 --> 00:06:56.120 align:middle line:84%
First of all, I wanna ask
you why people are perceiving

00:06:56.120 --> 00:06:59.680 align:middle line:84%
that times are challenging,
because, I mean,

00:06:59.680 --> 00:07:01.110 align:middle line:90%
we all feel the influence.

00:07:01.110 --> 00:07:02.490 align:middle line:84%
But at the same
time, I look back

00:07:02.490 --> 00:07:05.190 align:middle line:84%
on the past and the
brutality of our history.

00:07:05.190 --> 00:07:07.380 align:middle line:84%
We're probably in one of
the most light-filled ages

00:07:07.380 --> 00:07:09.810 align:middle line:84%
ever in terms of at
least personal behavior

00:07:09.810 --> 00:07:11.860 align:middle line:90%
toward one another.

00:07:11.860 --> 00:07:14.580 align:middle line:84%
Let's talk about,
first, the perception

00:07:14.580 --> 00:07:17.880 align:middle line:84%
of why things feel so
challenging for humanity right

00:07:17.880 --> 00:07:19.120 align:middle line:90%
now.

00:07:19.120 --> 00:07:20.130 align:middle line:90%
Is that true?

00:07:20.130 --> 00:07:23.940 align:middle line:84%
Is the media projecting that
and it's creating this feeling,

00:07:23.940 --> 00:07:28.180 align:middle line:84%
or is there something within
the cosmos that's creating that?

00:07:28.180 --> 00:07:31.980 align:middle line:84%
>> ARNÚS-ARRAUT: So we've
entered into an age of air.

00:07:31.980 --> 00:07:36.840 align:middle line:84%
And air is the mind,
communication, information.

00:07:36.840 --> 00:07:40.860 align:middle line:84%
And we're learning to
understand air, which

00:07:40.860 --> 00:07:43.960 align:middle line:90%
is the power of our minds.

00:07:43.960 --> 00:07:47.400 align:middle line:84%
So in a way, we're
becoming so malleable

00:07:47.400 --> 00:07:51.450 align:middle line:84%
that if we're told
that life is chaotic

00:07:51.450 --> 00:07:56.490 align:middle line:84%
and that the world is shifting,
we are going to believe it

00:07:56.490 --> 00:08:00.360 align:middle line:84%
and our minds are going to shift
into creating that experience.

00:08:00.360 --> 00:08:02.580 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So it's actually
because of the fluidity

00:08:02.580 --> 00:08:06.638 align:middle line:84%
of the field of the mind because
we're in, what, Aquarius?

00:08:06.638 --> 00:08:07.680 align:middle line:90%
>> ARNÚS-ARRAUT: Exactly.

00:08:07.680 --> 00:08:08.280 align:middle line:90%
Exactly.

00:08:08.280 --> 00:08:09.280 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Which is all--

00:08:09.280 --> 00:08:12.690 align:middle line:84%
Aquarius is also absolutely
brilliant in its ability

00:08:12.690 --> 00:08:16.330 align:middle line:84%
to sort through, solve
problems, and find a new way.

00:08:16.330 --> 00:08:18.480 align:middle line:84%
So let's go back to
the soul portion of it

00:08:18.480 --> 00:08:20.640 align:middle line:90%
and how you see it.

00:08:20.640 --> 00:08:24.060 align:middle line:84%
As a soul choosing
to incarnate, you're

00:08:24.060 --> 00:08:26.730 align:middle line:84%
choosing your family,
your place, your time,

00:08:26.730 --> 00:08:27.780 align:middle line:90%
and all of that.

00:08:27.780 --> 00:08:30.103 align:middle line:84%
What's that look like
from you, your side?

00:08:30.103 --> 00:08:31.770 align:middle line:84%
>> ARNÚS-ARRAUT: So
from my perspective,

00:08:31.770 --> 00:08:35.250 align:middle line:84%
and what I've studied, what I've
experienced, what I've felt,

00:08:35.250 --> 00:08:40.169 align:middle line:84%
we choose a certain pattern
to be born under based

00:08:40.169 --> 00:08:46.320 align:middle line:84%
on the lives, the lifetime
patterns that we're following.

00:08:46.320 --> 00:08:50.430 align:middle line:84%
So it's based on frequency,
vibration, codes.

00:08:50.430 --> 00:08:56.250 align:middle line:84%
So we choose our date, date
of birth, time of birth,

00:08:56.250 --> 00:08:59.490 align:middle line:84%
place of birth, based
on codes that we

00:08:59.490 --> 00:09:02.100 align:middle line:84%
need to be born under
so that they resonate

00:09:02.100 --> 00:09:05.760 align:middle line:84%
with our soul's pattern and
pattern of evolution, pattern

00:09:05.760 --> 00:09:08.430 align:middle line:90%
of growth.

00:09:08.430 --> 00:09:13.452 align:middle line:84%
So this is where the life
map or natal chart or astral

00:09:13.452 --> 00:09:14.910 align:middle line:84%
chart, however you
want to call it,

00:09:14.910 --> 00:09:19.800 align:middle line:84%
comes in, because we're
born under a certain grid,

00:09:19.800 --> 00:09:21.360 align:middle line:84%
a certain map, a
certain pattern,

00:09:21.360 --> 00:09:23.940 align:middle line:84%
and we choose that date
of birth, time of birth

00:09:23.940 --> 00:09:27.730 align:middle line:84%
to be born under that map
or under that pattern.

00:09:27.730 --> 00:09:31.650 align:middle line:84%
So let's say that
an astral chart

00:09:31.650 --> 00:09:33.840 align:middle line:84%
is like a screenshot
or a picture taken

00:09:33.840 --> 00:09:38.130 align:middle line:84%
from our perspective on
Earth from the first moment

00:09:38.130 --> 00:09:43.570 align:middle line:84%
that we take breath as humans,
which is our birth time, right?

00:09:43.570 --> 00:09:48.660 align:middle line:84%
So from our birth time,
we are given a map just

00:09:48.660 --> 00:09:52.770 align:middle line:84%
by looking or having
this picture of the grid

00:09:52.770 --> 00:09:56.020 align:middle line:84%
or the celestial sky
from that perspective.

00:09:56.020 --> 00:09:58.560 align:middle line:84%
So I feel it's important to
highlight the fact that it's

00:09:58.560 --> 00:10:01.500 align:middle line:90%
always from our perspective.

00:10:01.500 --> 00:10:04.050 align:middle line:84%
Because when we see things
from other perspective,

00:10:04.050 --> 00:10:06.810 align:middle line:84%
reality shifts and
reality changes.

00:10:06.810 --> 00:10:11.260 align:middle line:84%
So astrology exists from
our perspective on Earth.

00:10:11.260 --> 00:10:12.060 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:10:12.060 --> 00:10:13.102 align:middle line:90%
That makes perfect sense.

00:10:13.102 --> 00:10:14.160 align:middle line:90%
Of course.

00:10:14.160 --> 00:10:17.740 align:middle line:84%
>> ARNÚS-ARRAUT: From our
perspective as humans.

00:10:17.740 --> 00:10:20.280 align:middle line:84%
So in a way, when
we're born, we're

00:10:20.280 --> 00:10:24.360 align:middle line:84%
given this map which
holds a pattern.

00:10:24.360 --> 00:10:26.350 align:middle line:84%
What I want to
emphasize, though,

00:10:26.350 --> 00:10:32.490 align:middle line:84%
is that this pattern is not
going to limit your life.

00:10:32.490 --> 00:10:37.620 align:middle line:84%
It comes to guide you to awaken
in this life and for you to get

00:10:37.620 --> 00:10:41.110 align:middle line:84%
to know yourself so that
you know your pattern,

00:10:41.110 --> 00:10:43.230 align:middle line:84%
so that you know what
pattern you're born under,

00:10:43.230 --> 00:10:46.050 align:middle line:84%
because you cannot escape
the pattern, the grid,

00:10:46.050 --> 00:10:48.240 align:middle line:84%
or the matrix, however
you want to call it,

00:10:48.240 --> 00:10:52.770 align:middle line:84%
without knowing what you're
escaping from or what

00:10:52.770 --> 00:10:57.100 align:middle line:84%
you're going through or
what to break through from.

00:10:57.100 --> 00:11:00.990 align:middle line:84%
So that's why I feel that
knowing that map which

00:11:00.990 --> 00:11:03.450 align:middle line:84%
is connected to the
codes of your birth

00:11:03.450 --> 00:11:07.860 align:middle line:84%
that your soul chooses
as you are born, right?

00:11:07.860 --> 00:11:10.470 align:middle line:84%
And it chooses out of like,
a pattern, out of like,

00:11:10.470 --> 00:11:16.170 align:middle line:84%
a motion of energy, and
based on pretty much a grid

00:11:16.170 --> 00:11:18.390 align:middle line:90%
of lifetimes.

00:11:18.390 --> 00:11:24.210 align:middle line:84%
So by knowing this map, you hold
the key to your life in a way.

00:11:24.210 --> 00:11:26.040 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Well,
and what's also--

00:11:26.040 --> 00:11:29.190 align:middle line:84%
you're making me reflect
back on I have a friend who

00:11:29.190 --> 00:11:31.800 align:middle line:84%
was born in India, and it's
very common practice-- at least,

00:11:31.800 --> 00:11:32.820 align:middle line:90%
when she was born.

00:11:32.820 --> 00:11:34.767 align:middle line:84%
I know some of the
younger generations

00:11:34.767 --> 00:11:35.850 align:middle line:90%
have moved away from this.

00:11:35.850 --> 00:11:39.060 align:middle line:84%
But it was a beautiful
practice that a couple of days

00:11:39.060 --> 00:11:41.550 align:middle line:84%
after birth, the astrologer
would come to your home

00:11:41.550 --> 00:11:45.060 align:middle line:84%
and speak to your parents about
your chart and your strengths

00:11:45.060 --> 00:11:46.350 align:middle line:90%
and what you came to do.

00:11:46.350 --> 00:11:50.940 align:middle line:84%
And I would think that if a
parent could take heed of that

00:11:50.940 --> 00:11:54.030 align:middle line:84%
and it's accurately
read, that that

00:11:54.030 --> 00:11:56.800 align:middle line:84%
could be a tremendous help
for a little child growing up.

00:11:56.800 --> 00:11:57.420 align:middle line:84%
>> ARNÚS-ARRAUT:
Wow, absolutely.

00:11:57.420 --> 00:11:59.910 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Don't try to force
them into some shoe that

00:11:59.910 --> 00:12:01.323 align:middle line:90%
doesn't fit, you know?

00:12:01.323 --> 00:12:02.490 align:middle line:90%
>> ARNÚS-ARRAUT: Absolutely.

00:12:02.490 --> 00:12:03.290 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:12:03.290 --> 00:12:07.680 align:middle line:84%
>> ARNÚS-ARRAUT: And we would
also see what the kid is taking

00:12:07.680 --> 00:12:10.180 align:middle line:84%
on from their parents and
their ancestral lineage.

00:12:10.180 --> 00:12:10.980 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:12:10.980 --> 00:12:13.050 align:middle line:84%
>> ARNÚS-ARRAUT: Why
is the kid there?

00:12:13.050 --> 00:12:17.440 align:middle line:84%
What's its purpose as
a kid, as their child?

00:12:17.440 --> 00:12:19.900 align:middle line:84%
How is the kid perceiving
the mother, the father,

00:12:19.900 --> 00:12:22.740 align:middle line:84%
the conditions of birth,
the conditions in which he

00:12:22.740 --> 00:12:26.100 align:middle line:84%
was conceived and what
he was conceived for?

00:12:26.100 --> 00:12:29.490 align:middle line:84%
Because we all are conceived
for a certain reason.

00:12:29.490 --> 00:12:31.140 align:middle line:90%
It's usually subconscious.

00:12:31.140 --> 00:12:34.290 align:middle line:84%
But it's beautiful to see
its place in the chart

00:12:34.290 --> 00:12:36.540 align:middle line:84%
or to see it illustrated
with a certain code,

00:12:36.540 --> 00:12:39.610 align:middle line:84%
a certain constellation, a
certain planetary connection.

00:12:39.610 --> 00:12:40.410 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:12:40.410 --> 00:12:42.510 align:middle line:84%
And that gets-- this also
gets into the subject

00:12:42.510 --> 00:12:44.970 align:middle line:90%
that people argue about a lot.

00:12:44.970 --> 00:12:46.985 align:middle line:84%
Well, if astrology
is going to rule us,

00:12:46.985 --> 00:12:48.360 align:middle line:84%
then we don't have
any free will.

00:12:48.360 --> 00:12:49.860 align:middle line:84%
And I always say,
well, sure you do.

00:12:49.860 --> 00:12:50.730 align:middle line:90%
You chose it.

00:12:50.730 --> 00:12:52.320 align:middle line:90%


00:12:52.320 --> 00:12:54.060 align:middle line:84%
Free will is a
misunderstood subject,

00:12:54.060 --> 00:12:56.793 align:middle line:84%
and it precedes our
preferences in the moment

00:12:56.793 --> 00:12:58.710 align:middle line:84%
and whether we're happy
or unhappy with what's

00:12:58.710 --> 00:13:00.250 align:middle line:90%
going on in our lives.

00:13:00.250 --> 00:13:03.330 align:middle line:84%
So the free will has
come as the soul, right?

00:13:03.330 --> 00:13:04.590 align:middle line:90%
The soul's choice.

00:13:04.590 --> 00:13:06.120 align:middle line:84%
So now, you come
into this and you

00:13:06.120 --> 00:13:09.210 align:middle line:84%
see such a variety of life
experiences, people who've

00:13:09.210 --> 00:13:12.810 align:middle line:84%
chosen the most dire,
challenging environments,

00:13:12.810 --> 00:13:15.330 align:middle line:90%
families, times of birth.

00:13:15.330 --> 00:13:18.060 align:middle line:84%
So let's talk about
what happens when

00:13:18.060 --> 00:13:21.630 align:middle line:84%
you watch a soul who's
chosen the worst conditions

00:13:21.630 --> 00:13:22.710 align:middle line:90%
to be born under.

00:13:22.710 --> 00:13:24.270 align:middle line:84%
You might not even
make it past three

00:13:24.270 --> 00:13:26.062 align:middle line:84%
because you're also in
a drought and you're

00:13:26.062 --> 00:13:27.400 align:middle line:90%
going to starve to death.

00:13:27.400 --> 00:13:29.170 align:middle line:90%
So how do you see this?

00:13:29.170 --> 00:13:31.620 align:middle line:84%
>> ARNÚS-ARRAUT: So
it's a very interesting.

00:13:31.620 --> 00:13:34.680 align:middle line:84%
I mean, I get asked
this so many times.

00:13:34.680 --> 00:13:39.750 align:middle line:84%
But I feel that positive and
negative is a perspective.

00:13:39.750 --> 00:13:43.020 align:middle line:84%
There's obviously
more challenging

00:13:43.020 --> 00:13:47.110 align:middle line:84%
planetary placements,
but at the same time,

00:13:47.110 --> 00:13:51.360 align:middle line:84%
it's also connected to
inheritance, a pattern

00:13:51.360 --> 00:13:53.910 align:middle line:84%
that that soul comes
to live and comes

00:13:53.910 --> 00:13:57.000 align:middle line:84%
to experience without
the mental judgment

00:13:57.000 --> 00:13:58.780 align:middle line:90%
of negative or positive.

00:13:58.780 --> 00:14:01.395 align:middle line:84%
I feel it's just experience
and growth and evolution.

00:14:01.395 --> 00:14:02.520 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Evolving through.

00:14:02.520 --> 00:14:04.728 align:middle line:84%
>> ARNÚS-ARRAUT: And evolving
through and resilience,

00:14:04.728 --> 00:14:06.930 align:middle line:84%
and seeing different
perspectives,

00:14:06.930 --> 00:14:10.380 align:middle line:84%
or breaking through
a mold of starvation,

00:14:10.380 --> 00:14:13.110 align:middle line:84%
breaking through a
mold of scarcity, like,

00:14:13.110 --> 00:14:16.620 align:middle line:84%
transcending that pattern so
that future generations from

00:14:16.620 --> 00:14:21.900 align:middle line:84%
that specific soul can evolve
more or quicker or have much

00:14:21.900 --> 00:14:24.063 align:middle line:90%
more lighter human experience.

00:14:24.063 --> 00:14:25.605 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And this
includes violence.

00:14:25.605 --> 00:14:26.100 align:middle line:90%
>> ARNÚS-ARRAUT: Yes.

00:14:26.100 --> 00:14:27.210 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Because
that's the big one.

00:14:27.210 --> 00:14:28.770 align:middle line:90%
That's what gets most people.

00:14:28.770 --> 00:14:32.130 align:middle line:84%
Is thay say, no, I
would have never chosen

00:14:32.130 --> 00:14:35.760 align:middle line:84%
a life like that where I would
be mistreated in this way,

00:14:35.760 --> 00:14:40.870 align:middle line:84%
my parents were abusive,
my boyfriend was abusive.

00:14:40.870 --> 00:14:43.560 align:middle line:84%
But the New Age speak
is, well, you chose it.

00:14:43.560 --> 00:14:47.370 align:middle line:84%
There is a place for
both, for compassion,

00:14:47.370 --> 00:14:50.040 align:middle line:84%
for the growth and
evolution of a soul who's

00:14:50.040 --> 00:14:52.333 align:middle line:90%
chosen such a challenging path.

00:14:52.333 --> 00:14:54.750 align:middle line:84%
Talk about that for a moment,
because it's hard for people

00:14:54.750 --> 00:14:57.400 align:middle line:84%
to accept children who
are abused, for example.

00:14:57.400 --> 00:14:58.200 align:middle line:90%
Very hard.

00:14:58.200 --> 00:15:01.530 align:middle line:84%
>> ARNÚS-ARRAUT: I have a lot of
clients who come to me telling

00:15:01.530 --> 00:15:06.840 align:middle line:84%
me their abuse problems, their
abuse, like, past abuses,

00:15:06.840 --> 00:15:09.210 align:middle line:84%
sexual abuse, like
all kinds of abuses,

00:15:09.210 --> 00:15:13.470 align:middle line:84%
but they come to
me and immediately,

00:15:13.470 --> 00:15:15.660 align:middle line:84%
the first thing that I
do is give them a shift

00:15:15.660 --> 00:15:17.280 align:middle line:90%
of perspective.

00:15:17.280 --> 00:15:21.030 align:middle line:84%
Because we are all
creators of our life.

00:15:21.030 --> 00:15:23.640 align:middle line:84%
And that's why I love
astrology so much because it

00:15:23.640 --> 00:15:25.890 align:middle line:90%
shows you the hidden truths.

00:15:25.890 --> 00:15:30.060 align:middle line:84%
So someone who has
been abused or has

00:15:30.060 --> 00:15:34.110 align:middle line:84%
gone through a big trauma in
their lives, that's also--

00:15:34.110 --> 00:15:37.860 align:middle line:84%
it's not that it's
written, but their ability

00:15:37.860 --> 00:15:43.560 align:middle line:84%
of put themselves in positions
of victimhood is there.

00:15:43.560 --> 00:15:46.680 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: You'll see it
in the chart specifically.

00:15:46.680 --> 00:15:49.920 align:middle line:84%
>> ARNÚS-ARRAUT: This soul
or this person has a tendency

00:15:49.920 --> 00:15:55.270 align:middle line:84%
of finding comfort in very
victimized situations.

00:15:55.270 --> 00:15:56.820 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And we
can see this all--

00:15:56.820 --> 00:15:59.670 align:middle line:84%
we can all see it either
glimpses in ourself

00:15:59.670 --> 00:16:02.370 align:middle line:84%
or people around us where
you keep going through

00:16:02.370 --> 00:16:05.790 align:middle line:84%
these repetitive patterns of
even the most subtle abuse.

00:16:05.790 --> 00:16:10.050 align:middle line:84%
Maybe you choose to be the butt
of the jokes of your family

00:16:10.050 --> 00:16:12.540 align:middle line:84%
and your extended circle
of friends and at work,

00:16:12.540 --> 00:16:15.690 align:middle line:84%
and they always say things
that are kind of humiliating.

00:16:15.690 --> 00:16:18.210 align:middle line:84%
But somehow, you've
chosen to stay in that

00:16:18.210 --> 00:16:20.803 align:middle line:84%
and are not breaking
through it for some reason.

00:16:20.803 --> 00:16:21.720 align:middle line:90%
>> ARNÚS-ARRAUT: Yeah.

00:16:21.720 --> 00:16:27.390 align:middle line:84%
So for people that have
these codes of loving

00:16:27.390 --> 00:16:32.120 align:middle line:84%
to feel that victim,
it's important

00:16:32.120 --> 00:16:36.810 align:middle line:84%
that they see themselves
as also a victimizer.

00:16:36.810 --> 00:16:37.610 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:16:37.610 --> 00:16:40.850 align:middle line:84%
>> ARNÚS-ARRAUT: Someone who
loves to be in those states

00:16:40.850 --> 00:16:44.660 align:middle line:84%
of causing harm, but also,
receiving it and find that

00:16:44.660 --> 00:16:47.180 align:middle line:84%
pleasure or guilty
pleasure on it.

00:16:47.180 --> 00:16:48.570 align:middle line:90%
And it's very subconscious.

00:16:48.570 --> 00:16:49.370 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: It is.

00:16:49.370 --> 00:16:51.800 align:middle line:84%
Because oftentimes,
it's a common phenomena

00:16:51.800 --> 00:16:54.470 align:middle line:84%
where the abused, once
in a position of power,

00:16:54.470 --> 00:16:56.300 align:middle line:90%
become the abusers.

00:16:56.300 --> 00:16:57.380 align:middle line:90%
>> ARNÚS-ARRAUT: Exactly.

00:16:57.380 --> 00:17:03.200 align:middle line:84%
And it has a lot to do with
their ability to receive love

00:17:03.200 --> 00:17:06.589 align:middle line:84%
and what their
subconscious needs

00:17:06.589 --> 00:17:10.550 align:middle line:90%
to do in order to attract love.

00:17:10.550 --> 00:17:13.339 align:middle line:84%
Because their
subconscious pattern

00:17:13.339 --> 00:17:17.510 align:middle line:84%
has not developed into asking
for love when they need it,

00:17:17.510 --> 00:17:22.190 align:middle line:84%
but into creating harming
scenarios for them

00:17:22.190 --> 00:17:25.617 align:middle line:90%
to ask for love non-verbally.

00:17:25.617 --> 00:17:27.950 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So if you're reading
a chart of a person who's

00:17:27.950 --> 00:17:30.560 align:middle line:84%
gone through a fair amount
of abuse of whatever kind,

00:17:30.560 --> 00:17:32.810 align:middle line:84%
and you're seeing it's
right there in the chart

00:17:32.810 --> 00:17:35.180 align:middle line:84%
that they chose a
familial situation which

00:17:35.180 --> 00:17:37.850 align:middle line:84%
had that embedded,
do you also see

00:17:37.850 --> 00:17:40.760 align:middle line:84%
the contrary aspect
of the path out,

00:17:40.760 --> 00:17:45.330 align:middle line:84%
or does that become a matter
of kind of will, if you will.

00:17:45.330 --> 00:17:51.350 align:middle line:84%
>> ARNÚS-ARRAUT: So I feel that
to balance out that victim mode

00:17:51.350 --> 00:17:55.190 align:middle line:84%
is to go towards the
take ownership and take

00:17:55.190 --> 00:17:58.400 align:middle line:84%
responsibility of your
life in every situation.

00:17:58.400 --> 00:18:01.730 align:middle line:84%
Because, I mean, it's
very normal, especially

00:18:01.730 --> 00:18:05.780 align:middle line:84%
nowadays to feel victims of our
parents, victims of the past,

00:18:05.780 --> 00:18:07.680 align:middle line:84%
victims of past
generations as well.

00:18:07.680 --> 00:18:08.480 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:18:08.480 --> 00:18:11.030 align:middle line:84%
>> ARNÚS-ARRAUT: But that
takes responsibility out

00:18:11.030 --> 00:18:14.150 align:middle line:84%
of our present moment
and out of ourselves.

00:18:14.150 --> 00:18:17.390 align:middle line:84%
So going back again
to the natal chart,

00:18:17.390 --> 00:18:21.770 align:middle line:84%
I feel that by looking at it or
understanding or being helped

00:18:21.770 --> 00:18:26.600 align:middle line:84%
to understand it, we're given
a very big gift of taking

00:18:26.600 --> 00:18:29.540 align:middle line:84%
ownership and responsibility
of our creations

00:18:29.540 --> 00:18:34.010 align:middle line:84%
and our experiences, our
surrounding experiences.

00:18:34.010 --> 00:18:36.930 align:middle line:90%
Because we are also them.

00:18:36.930 --> 00:18:37.730 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:18:37.730 --> 00:18:38.960 align:middle line:90%
Perfectly stated.

00:18:38.960 --> 00:18:40.127 align:middle line:90%
Very articulate, very clear.

00:18:40.127 --> 00:18:41.252 align:middle line:90%
>> ARNÚS-ARRAUT: Thank you.

00:18:41.252 --> 00:18:43.340 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So now
let's kind of dive in.

00:18:43.340 --> 00:18:46.720 align:middle line:84%
You just said it a moment ago,
even generations, you know?

00:18:46.720 --> 00:18:48.980 align:middle line:90%
Because this is a topic I love.

00:18:48.980 --> 00:18:50.600 align:middle line:84%
We teased a bit
at the beginning,

00:18:50.600 --> 00:18:52.380 align:middle line:84%
everyone pointing
fingers at each other,

00:18:52.380 --> 00:18:53.870 align:middle line:90%
creating even more division.

00:18:53.870 --> 00:18:54.930 align:middle line:90%
It's pop culture.

00:18:54.930 --> 00:18:57.560 align:middle line:84%
It's part of pop culture
for generations to be

00:18:57.560 --> 00:18:58.910 align:middle line:90%
blaming other generations.

00:18:58.910 --> 00:19:01.140 align:middle line:90%
It's in headline news.

00:19:01.140 --> 00:19:03.230 align:middle line:84%
If you look at your
Apple app, you're

00:19:03.230 --> 00:19:06.080 align:middle line:84%
going to see something
on Gen Z or Millennials

00:19:06.080 --> 00:19:07.530 align:middle line:90%
and this kind of thing.

00:19:07.530 --> 00:19:11.820 align:middle line:84%
So I would like to talk about
what the generations are,

00:19:11.820 --> 00:19:14.370 align:middle line:84%
what their influences
are, and what they offer.

00:19:14.370 --> 00:19:17.180 align:middle line:84%
So we can go into more
compassionate understanding

00:19:17.180 --> 00:19:19.770 align:middle line:90%
of what each one came to offer.

00:19:19.770 --> 00:19:23.990 align:middle line:84%
So we can start with the
youngest generation going up

00:19:23.990 --> 00:19:25.967 align:middle line:90%
or the older generation.

00:19:25.967 --> 00:19:27.800 align:middle line:84%
Really probably the
last one that's relevant

00:19:27.800 --> 00:19:29.930 align:middle line:84%
is the Boomers, because
most of the rest

00:19:29.930 --> 00:19:33.620 align:middle line:84%
have died off before the
Boomers, for the most part.

00:19:33.620 --> 00:19:35.370 align:middle line:90%
And won't be listening to this.

00:19:35.370 --> 00:19:38.640 align:middle line:84%
So let's start with the
Boomers and move our way down.

00:19:38.640 --> 00:19:41.900 align:middle line:84%
So here you have the Boomers,
post World War II generation.

00:19:41.900 --> 00:19:46.080 align:middle line:84%
Raised by the Depression
era generation.

00:19:46.080 --> 00:19:51.813 align:middle line:84%
So as a Leo generation, what
did the Boomers represent?

00:19:51.813 --> 00:19:52.730 align:middle line:90%
>> ARNÚS-ARRAUT: Yeah.

00:19:52.730 --> 00:19:56.000 align:middle line:84%
Before getting to what the
Boomers could represent,

00:19:56.000 --> 00:19:59.690 align:middle line:84%
I'd like to talk on
from my perspective, how

00:19:59.690 --> 00:20:01.462 align:middle line:90%
I like to see generations.

00:20:01.462 --> 00:20:02.420 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes, perfect.

00:20:02.420 --> 00:20:03.220 align:middle line:90%
Let's do that.

00:20:03.220 --> 00:20:06.020 align:middle line:84%
>> ARNÚS-ARRAUT: Because I feel
that each generation is born

00:20:06.020 --> 00:20:08.810 align:middle line:84%
under a certain
subconscious pattern.

00:20:08.810 --> 00:20:11.938 align:middle line:84%
And subconscious
is a Pluto word.

00:20:11.938 --> 00:20:14.480 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And let's talk about
Pluto's influence for a moment

00:20:14.480 --> 00:20:15.890 align:middle line:90%
and what Pluto represents.

00:20:15.890 --> 00:20:16.765 align:middle line:90%
>> ARNÚS-ARRAUT: Yes.

00:20:16.765 --> 00:20:19.670 align:middle line:90%
So Pluto is the smallest planet.

00:20:19.670 --> 00:20:22.283 align:middle line:84%
I mean, astronomically,
I'm not even sure if it's

00:20:22.283 --> 00:20:23.450 align:middle line:90%
considered a planet anymore.

00:20:23.450 --> 00:20:24.530 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: People are arguing
it's not a planet anymore.

00:20:24.530 --> 00:20:25.760 align:middle line:84%
>> ARNÚS-ARRAUT: It's
a very big argument.

00:20:25.760 --> 00:20:27.140 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: But it's still
influencing us, right?

00:20:27.140 --> 00:20:28.473 align:middle line:90%
>> ARNÚS-ARRAUT: Oh, definitely.

00:20:28.473 --> 00:20:34.400 align:middle line:84%
And us or the mainstream
world trying to push Pluto out

00:20:34.400 --> 00:20:41.510 align:middle line:84%
of the planetary system is also
a key to Pluto being something

00:20:41.510 --> 00:20:43.940 align:middle line:90%
that we do not want to face.

00:20:43.940 --> 00:20:45.110 align:middle line:90%
Because it's our fears.

00:20:45.110 --> 00:20:46.070 align:middle line:90%
It's our shadows.

00:20:46.070 --> 00:20:47.450 align:middle line:90%
It's our subconscious.

00:20:47.450 --> 00:20:50.630 align:middle line:84%
It's everything
that's so raw, true,

00:20:50.630 --> 00:20:53.000 align:middle line:90%
that is so ugly to look at.

00:20:53.000 --> 00:20:56.450 align:middle line:84%
And at the same time,
it's so powerful.

00:20:56.450 --> 00:20:57.650 align:middle line:90%
We embrace it.

00:20:57.650 --> 00:20:59.760 align:middle line:90%
So Pluto's our personal power.

00:20:59.760 --> 00:21:00.560 align:middle line:90%
I mean--

00:21:00.560 --> 00:21:02.700 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And it's the
power of transformation.

00:21:02.700 --> 00:21:02.880 align:middle line:90%
>> ARNÚS-ARRAUT: Transformation.

00:21:02.880 --> 00:21:03.740 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: In its highest.

00:21:03.740 --> 00:21:04.615 align:middle line:90%
>> ARNÚS-ARRAUT: Yes.

00:21:04.615 --> 00:21:07.310 align:middle line:84%
And psychic abilities
is the planet

00:21:07.310 --> 00:21:12.380 align:middle line:84%
of, well, soul transformation,
a spiritual awakening.

00:21:12.380 --> 00:21:17.000 align:middle line:84%
Everything that has to do with
metamorphosis and awakening

00:21:17.000 --> 00:21:20.480 align:middle line:90%
and truth and uncovering.

00:21:20.480 --> 00:21:22.590 align:middle line:90%
The planet of sexuality as well.

00:21:22.590 --> 00:21:25.070 align:middle line:10%
So that's why I
like studying Pluto

00:21:25.070 --> 00:21:27.540 align:middle line:10%
to understand generations.

00:21:27.540 --> 00:21:31.980 align:middle line:10%
So baby Boomers with
Pluto in Leo, Pluto in Leo

00:21:31.980 --> 00:21:35.430 align:middle line:10%
was also making us see.

00:21:35.430 --> 00:21:38.430 align:middle line:84%
Because Leo's the energy of the
sun, is the energy of light.

00:21:38.430 --> 00:21:39.990 align:middle line:84%
And Pluto is the
energy of darkness.

00:21:39.990 --> 00:21:43.440 align:middle line:84%
So in a way, the darkness
was in your face.

00:21:43.440 --> 00:21:45.810 align:middle line:84%
The darkness was
really coming out

00:21:45.810 --> 00:21:49.670 align:middle line:84%
to light in very key
important figures.

00:21:49.670 --> 00:21:51.420 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Well, this
is when a lot of us--

00:21:51.420 --> 00:21:55.320 align:middle line:84%
key assassinations occurred
that traumatized certainly

00:21:55.320 --> 00:21:58.000 align:middle line:84%
Americans, but other
cultures as well.

00:21:58.000 --> 00:22:00.900 align:middle line:84%
It's when a war that was
the first war that people

00:22:00.900 --> 00:22:04.198 align:middle line:84%
actually protested against
and said, this is BS.

00:22:04.198 --> 00:22:06.240 align:middle line:84%
I'm not going to go over
there for those reasons.

00:22:06.240 --> 00:22:09.790 align:middle line:84%
That's the first real protesting
of war en masse that occurred.

00:22:09.790 --> 00:22:13.380 align:middle line:84%
So let's talk about it within
that context of assassinations,

00:22:13.380 --> 00:22:15.330 align:middle line:90%
rejecting war, and so forth.

00:22:15.330 --> 00:22:19.140 align:middle line:84%
>> ARNÚS-ARRAUT: Well, when
darkness come out to light,

00:22:19.140 --> 00:22:20.850 align:middle line:90%
we tend to reject it.

00:22:20.850 --> 00:22:26.700 align:middle line:84%
So souls that have a very strong
impact needed to incarnate

00:22:26.700 --> 00:22:29.040 align:middle line:84%
and needed to--
because lots of them

00:22:29.040 --> 00:22:30.870 align:middle line:90%
were born with Pluto in Leo.

00:22:30.870 --> 00:22:35.790 align:middle line:84%
And they needed to incarnate to
bring the darkness out to light

00:22:35.790 --> 00:22:39.210 align:middle line:90%
in the most impactful way.

00:22:39.210 --> 00:22:40.900 align:middle line:90%
Because Leo is drama.

00:22:40.900 --> 00:22:41.700 align:middle line:90%
Leo is big.

00:22:41.700 --> 00:22:43.450 align:middle line:84%
It doesn't have anything
to do with people

00:22:43.450 --> 00:22:44.742 align:middle line:90%
who are born under the Leo sun.

00:22:44.742 --> 00:22:45.542 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:22:45.542 --> 00:22:47.520 align:middle line:84%
>> ARNÚS-ARRAUT: But
the Leo energy is loud,

00:22:47.520 --> 00:22:48.970 align:middle line:84%
because it's the
energy of light.

00:22:48.970 --> 00:22:50.490 align:middle line:90%
It's in your face.

00:22:50.490 --> 00:22:53.790 align:middle line:84%
So by Pluto being there
in that generation,

00:22:53.790 --> 00:22:57.690 align:middle line:84%
it created a lot of
fear of the occult,

00:22:57.690 --> 00:23:00.460 align:middle line:90%
but also this magnetism to it.

00:23:00.460 --> 00:23:01.260 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:23:01.260 --> 00:23:03.310 align:middle line:90%
>> ARNÚS-ARRAUT: Because of--

00:23:03.310 --> 00:23:05.300 align:middle line:90%
it's not hidden anymore.

00:23:05.300 --> 00:23:08.260 align:middle line:84%
And now it's a time where it
doesn't need to be hidden.

00:23:08.260 --> 00:23:12.280 align:middle line:84%
And also with, well,
assassinations.

00:23:12.280 --> 00:23:14.960 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: There was
a lot of rebellion.

00:23:14.960 --> 00:23:17.800 align:middle line:84%
>> ARNÚS-ARRAUT: And it
was about when, well,

00:23:17.800 --> 00:23:21.760 align:middle line:84%
at least in Europe, big
important figures were taking

00:23:21.760 --> 00:23:26.260 align:middle line:84%
control and ownership and
governing the entire continent,

00:23:26.260 --> 00:23:27.310 align:middle line:90%
pretty much.

00:23:27.310 --> 00:23:31.880 align:middle line:84%
Ruled by very key figure
that held a lot of power.

00:23:31.880 --> 00:23:38.560 align:middle line:84%
So it's also how much power
can you hold and how much--

00:23:38.560 --> 00:23:41.015 align:middle line:84%
the abuse of power,
how toxic it can be.

00:23:41.015 --> 00:23:41.815 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:23:41.815 --> 00:23:42.127 align:middle line:90%


00:23:42.127 --> 00:23:42.520 align:middle line:90%
>> ARNÚS-ARRAUT: So that was--

00:23:42.520 --> 00:23:44.145 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And at the
same time, they're

00:23:44.145 --> 00:23:46.660 align:middle line:84%
raised by people who were raised
during the Depression, went

00:23:46.660 --> 00:23:47.860 align:middle line:90%
through World War II.

00:23:47.860 --> 00:23:49.990 align:middle line:84%
So the work ethic
was very strong.

00:23:49.990 --> 00:23:53.080 align:middle line:90%
As a Boomer, it was simple.

00:23:53.080 --> 00:23:56.030 align:middle line:84%
Everyone I knew, it was all
the same in our neighborhood.

00:23:56.030 --> 00:23:56.260 align:middle line:90%
>> ARNÚS-ARRAUT: Yeah.

00:23:56.260 --> 00:23:57.880 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: When you graduate
from high school, you're out.

00:23:57.880 --> 00:23:59.290 align:middle line:90%
You're on your own.

00:23:59.290 --> 00:24:02.140 align:middle line:84%
You can stay maybe the summer,
but you're on your own.

00:24:02.140 --> 00:24:04.540 align:middle line:84%
Now that's changed
considerably, obviously.

00:24:04.540 --> 00:24:07.283 align:middle line:84%
It was the way their parents,
our parents were raised,

00:24:07.283 --> 00:24:08.200 align:middle line:90%
>> ARNÚS-ARRAUT: Yeah.

00:24:08.200 --> 00:24:11.110 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So you have this work
ethic, but also kind of harsh.

00:24:11.110 --> 00:24:13.750 align:middle line:90%
And we're in a boom materially.

00:24:13.750 --> 00:24:16.377 align:middle line:84%
Post-World War II, the
economy is booming.

00:24:16.377 --> 00:24:17.710 align:middle line:90%
So now you have material wealth.

00:24:17.710 --> 00:24:18.670 align:middle line:90%
>> ARNÚS-ARRAUT: And creation.

00:24:18.670 --> 00:24:19.490 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Creation.

00:24:19.490 --> 00:24:20.290 align:middle line:90%
Yes, creations.

00:24:20.290 --> 00:24:22.373 align:middle line:84%
>> ARNÚS-ARRAUT: Because
that's the energy of Leo.

00:24:22.373 --> 00:24:24.400 align:middle line:84%
Leo's the energy of
creativity, creation.

00:24:24.400 --> 00:24:27.350 align:middle line:84%
And Pluto, it's also
the planet of obsession.

00:24:27.350 --> 00:24:30.490 align:middle line:84%
But it ruled that
generation's subconscious.

00:24:30.490 --> 00:24:34.000 align:middle line:84%
So it's a pressure
to have lots of kids.

00:24:34.000 --> 00:24:36.434 align:middle line:84%
It's the pressure to
have lots of businesses.

00:24:36.434 --> 00:24:37.309 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: A new home.

00:24:37.309 --> 00:24:39.200 align:middle line:90%
Have new appliances, a new car.

00:24:39.200 --> 00:24:40.270 align:middle line:90%
>> ARNÚS-ARRAUT: Yeah.

00:24:40.270 --> 00:24:43.033 align:middle line:90%
Create from scratch.

00:24:43.033 --> 00:24:44.200 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes, from scratch.

00:24:44.200 --> 00:24:47.150 align:middle line:84%
And most of those industries
were from scratch at that time.

00:24:47.150 --> 00:24:49.480 align:middle line:90%
So that's the Leo generation.

00:24:49.480 --> 00:24:52.420 align:middle line:84%
Kind of the blowback
and rebellion.

00:24:52.420 --> 00:24:54.640 align:middle line:84%
And even as older
people, that still

00:24:54.640 --> 00:24:56.290 align:middle line:90%
exists within that generation.

00:24:56.290 --> 00:24:57.165 align:middle line:90%
>> ARNÚS-ARRAUT: Yes.

00:24:57.165 --> 00:24:59.140 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So then
comes the Gen Xers,

00:24:59.140 --> 00:25:01.000 align:middle line:84%
which is really
interesting, because no one

00:25:01.000 --> 00:25:02.140 align:middle line:90%
points any figures.

00:25:02.140 --> 00:25:04.780 align:middle line:84%
You don't see Gen Xers
ever in the headlines.

00:25:04.780 --> 00:25:06.230 align:middle line:90%
>> ARNÚS-ARRAUT: You know why?

00:25:06.230 --> 00:25:08.140 align:middle line:90%
Because Pluto was in Virgo.

00:25:08.140 --> 00:25:09.610 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes, exactly.

00:25:09.610 --> 00:25:11.720 align:middle line:90%
OK, so let's talk about that.

00:25:11.720 --> 00:25:13.450 align:middle line:90%
So Pluto's in Virgo.

00:25:13.450 --> 00:25:15.190 align:middle line:90%
And now what happens?

00:25:15.190 --> 00:25:18.910 align:middle line:84%
>> ARNÚS-ARRAUT: So Pluto
in Virgo is about the health

00:25:18.910 --> 00:25:19.870 align:middle line:90%
industry.

00:25:19.870 --> 00:25:21.370 align:middle line:90%
The routines.

00:25:21.370 --> 00:25:24.850 align:middle line:84%
Everything that has
to do with building

00:25:24.850 --> 00:25:27.087 align:middle line:90%
in a much more conscious way.

00:25:27.087 --> 00:25:29.170 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: That's when the
health movement started.

00:25:29.170 --> 00:25:30.970 align:middle line:90%
Vitamins, running.

00:25:30.970 --> 00:25:33.490 align:middle line:84%
All of these things where the
average person, you could see

00:25:33.490 --> 00:25:35.440 align:middle line:90%
them starting to jog and such.

00:25:35.440 --> 00:25:36.520 align:middle line:90%
>> ARNÚS-ARRAUT: Exactly.

00:25:36.520 --> 00:25:41.290 align:middle line:84%
They started to bring awareness
into day to day caring, day

00:25:41.290 --> 00:25:42.850 align:middle line:90%
to day lifestyles.

00:25:42.850 --> 00:25:44.350 align:middle line:90%
Taking care for your health.

00:25:44.350 --> 00:25:47.900 align:middle line:84%
Starting to question if
what we ate was good for us.

00:25:47.900 --> 00:25:49.900 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: That's right,
the whole nutrition boom

00:25:49.900 --> 00:25:50.770 align:middle line:90%
started then.

00:25:50.770 --> 00:25:54.190 align:middle line:84%
>> ARNÚS-ARRAUT: Is
smoking good for us?

00:25:54.190 --> 00:25:57.050 align:middle line:84%
All these drugs, what are
they doing to our system?

00:25:57.050 --> 00:26:00.460 align:middle line:84%
So when we started
bringing awareness

00:26:00.460 --> 00:26:04.690 align:middle line:84%
into what we're putting
into our bodies and why.

00:26:04.690 --> 00:26:07.840 align:middle line:84%
And then we move on to
Pluto in Libra, which

00:26:07.840 --> 00:26:09.850 align:middle line:90%
could also be considered Gen X.

00:26:09.850 --> 00:26:11.530 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: The younger Gen Xers.

00:26:11.530 --> 00:26:11.890 align:middle line:84%
>> ARNÚS-ARRAUT:
Yeah, the younger.

00:26:11.890 --> 00:26:14.110 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: But that goes
into the classic stamp

00:26:14.110 --> 00:26:16.030 align:middle line:90%
of the Millennials.

00:26:16.030 --> 00:26:18.340 align:middle line:84%
>> ARNÚS-ARRAUT: The
last years of Gen X.

00:26:18.340 --> 00:26:19.940 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So let's
talk about that.

00:26:19.940 --> 00:26:22.630 align:middle line:84%
So Libra brings a completely
different influence.

00:26:22.630 --> 00:26:24.230 align:middle line:84%
>> ARNÚS-ARRAUT:
Completely different.

00:26:24.230 --> 00:26:28.870 align:middle line:84%
So Libra is the energy that has
to do with fairness, balance,

00:26:28.870 --> 00:26:31.750 align:middle line:90%
relationships.

00:26:31.750 --> 00:26:32.680 align:middle line:90%
Equality.

00:26:32.680 --> 00:26:33.640 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:26:33.640 --> 00:26:35.650 align:middle line:84%
>> ARNÚS-ARRAUT: And everything
that has to do with marriages,

00:26:35.650 --> 00:26:36.790 align:middle line:90%
divorce.

00:26:36.790 --> 00:26:39.340 align:middle line:84%
So when Pluto moves
into Libra, they

00:26:39.340 --> 00:26:42.140 align:middle line:84%
start bringing awareness
that divorce is an option.

00:26:42.140 --> 00:26:42.940 align:middle line:90%
Why?

00:26:42.940 --> 00:26:45.610 align:middle line:84%
Because Pluto is also
the planet of death.

00:26:45.610 --> 00:26:48.050 align:middle line:84%
Libra is the energy
of relationships.

00:26:48.050 --> 00:26:52.000 align:middle line:84%
So that's why people who are
born under Pluto in Libra,

00:26:52.000 --> 00:26:56.050 align:middle line:84%
they tend to have experienced
a deep transformation

00:26:56.050 --> 00:27:00.910 align:middle line:84%
of their relationships
and understanding.

00:27:00.910 --> 00:27:03.430 align:middle line:84%
Not understanding divorce,
but understanding how to

00:27:03.430 --> 00:27:04.780 align:middle line:90%
transcend divorce.

00:27:04.780 --> 00:27:06.970 align:middle line:84%
But it's very normal
with Pluto in Libra

00:27:06.970 --> 00:27:09.910 align:middle line:84%
to go through a divorce at
least one time in your life,

00:27:09.910 --> 00:27:13.900 align:middle line:84%
because you come to experience
death of a relationship

00:27:13.900 --> 00:27:15.550 align:middle line:90%
and the rebirth of another one.

00:27:15.550 --> 00:27:18.400 align:middle line:84%
Because before that,
you got married.

00:27:18.400 --> 00:27:21.505 align:middle line:84%
And you stayed with that
person forever in a way.

00:27:21.505 --> 00:27:23.380 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And we're
talking about the years--

00:27:23.380 --> 00:27:24.323 align:middle line:90%
I wrote this down.

00:27:24.323 --> 00:27:25.240 align:middle line:90%
>> ARNÚS-ARRAUT: Yeah.

00:27:25.240 --> 00:27:28.735 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: '83 to '95 are the
dominant Libra years, right?

00:27:28.735 --> 00:27:30.610 align:middle line:84%
>> ARNÚS-ARRAUT: No,
that's Pluto in Scorpio.

00:27:30.610 --> 00:27:31.550 align:middle line:90%
Before that.

00:27:31.550 --> 00:27:34.668 align:middle line:90%
So it was from '72 to '83.

00:27:34.668 --> 00:27:35.710 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Oh yeah, right.

00:27:35.710 --> 00:27:39.580 align:middle line:84%
And so that's when the notion,
which is true, of divorce

00:27:39.580 --> 00:27:41.230 align:middle line:90%
started really coming into play.

00:27:41.230 --> 00:27:41.570 align:middle line:90%
>> ARNÚS-ARRAUT: Exactly.

00:27:41.570 --> 00:27:42.528 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: The fairness.

00:27:42.528 --> 00:27:45.370 align:middle line:84%
Do I have to stay in
an unbalanced situation

00:27:45.370 --> 00:27:47.808 align:middle line:84%
or something that's really
limiting me in some way, right?

00:27:47.808 --> 00:27:48.850 align:middle line:90%
>> ARNÚS-ARRAUT: Exactly.

00:27:48.850 --> 00:27:52.180 align:middle line:84%
Because that generation
is the one that--

00:27:52.180 --> 00:27:55.960 align:middle line:84%
and it's a very key
generation for what

00:27:55.960 --> 00:27:58.750 align:middle line:84%
we're going to be experiencing
in these next few decades

00:27:58.750 --> 00:28:01.630 align:middle line:84%
in the world, which is
understanding freedom

00:28:01.630 --> 00:28:06.170 align:middle line:84%
in relationships and
understanding that we

00:28:06.170 --> 00:28:09.050 align:middle line:90%
are each other's mirror.

00:28:09.050 --> 00:28:12.020 align:middle line:84%
So if you're not liking
the person you're with

00:28:12.020 --> 00:28:16.410 align:middle line:84%
might also be that you're not
liking a big part of yourself.

00:28:16.410 --> 00:28:17.210 align:middle line:90%
Why?

00:28:17.210 --> 00:28:20.150 align:middle line:84%
Because Pluto's the
shadow, Libra's the mirror.

00:28:20.150 --> 00:28:22.370 align:middle line:84%
So with Pluto in
Libra, you're going

00:28:22.370 --> 00:28:23.900 align:middle line:84%
to be triggered a
lot to be looking

00:28:23.900 --> 00:28:27.145 align:middle line:84%
at yourself or your shadows
in the mirror constantly.

00:28:27.145 --> 00:28:28.520 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: But it
seems to me also

00:28:28.520 --> 00:28:30.050 align:middle line:84%
on top of the
relationship, which

00:28:30.050 --> 00:28:35.540 align:middle line:84%
is the big piece that also
Libra brings in beauty.

00:28:35.540 --> 00:28:40.040 align:middle line:84%
And so I see a lot of the
entrepreneurs of the Libran age

00:28:40.040 --> 00:28:41.870 align:middle line:84%
are the ones who
have built businesses

00:28:41.870 --> 00:28:45.150 align:middle line:84%
that are very ordered toward
transforming lifestyle.

00:28:45.150 --> 00:28:45.950 align:middle line:90%
Like--

00:28:45.950 --> 00:28:46.825 align:middle line:90%
>> ARNÚS-ARRAUT: Yes.

00:28:46.825 --> 00:28:49.610 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Have a lot of
Zen Buddhist artifacts

00:28:49.610 --> 00:28:50.540 align:middle line:90%
in your home.

00:28:50.540 --> 00:28:53.810 align:middle line:90%
A Lululemon.

00:28:53.810 --> 00:28:56.200 align:middle line:84%
Vegan cheeses and
all of these kind

00:28:56.200 --> 00:28:59.600 align:middle line:84%
of gentle, beautiful,
transitional types

00:28:59.600 --> 00:29:01.190 align:middle line:90%
of properties to life.

00:29:01.190 --> 00:29:02.720 align:middle line:90%
Lifestyle in particular.

00:29:02.720 --> 00:29:03.980 align:middle line:90%
Yoga.

00:29:03.980 --> 00:29:06.650 align:middle line:90%
Yoga really came in under that.

00:29:06.650 --> 00:29:10.700 align:middle line:84%
>> ARNÚS-ARRAUT: So Pluto is
power, Libra is aesthetics.

00:29:10.700 --> 00:29:14.090 align:middle line:90%
Beauty, balance, fairness, also.

00:29:14.090 --> 00:29:18.020 align:middle line:84%
So their superpower, that
generation's superpower,

00:29:18.020 --> 00:29:20.540 align:middle line:84%
is their ability to make
everything beautiful.

00:29:20.540 --> 00:29:22.530 align:middle line:90%
To make everything likable.

00:29:22.530 --> 00:29:23.330 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:29:23.330 --> 00:29:26.300 align:middle line:84%
>> ARNÚS-ARRAUT: So if a
business started with Pluto

00:29:26.300 --> 00:29:29.330 align:middle line:84%
in Libra or a person with Pluto
in Libra creates a business,

00:29:29.330 --> 00:29:34.220 align:middle line:84%
it's going to be very
oriented on being likable.

00:29:34.220 --> 00:29:36.440 align:middle line:84%
On connecting to the
consumer very well.

00:29:36.440 --> 00:29:36.650 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:29:36.650 --> 00:29:38.650 align:middle line:84%
>> ARNÚS-ARRAUT: So of
course, they hold a very,

00:29:38.650 --> 00:29:40.568 align:middle line:90%
very profitable power.

00:29:40.568 --> 00:29:42.110 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: They do,
for the aesthetics

00:29:42.110 --> 00:29:43.800 align:middle line:90%
that they bring to the table.

00:29:43.800 --> 00:29:46.730 align:middle line:84%
And so we have aesthetics and
we have deep transformation

00:29:46.730 --> 00:29:47.840 align:middle line:90%
of relationships.

00:29:47.840 --> 00:29:52.340 align:middle line:84%
>> ARNÚS-ARRAUT: And it's also
a period of time where women

00:29:52.340 --> 00:29:54.300 align:middle line:84%
started gaining
a lot more power.

00:29:54.300 --> 00:29:55.100 align:middle line:90%
Why?

00:29:55.100 --> 00:29:57.890 align:middle line:84%
Because Libra is the
calibration of the masculine

00:29:57.890 --> 00:29:59.270 align:middle line:90%
and the feminine as well.

00:29:59.270 --> 00:30:02.960 align:middle line:84%
And Pluto is putting that
calibration into play

00:30:02.960 --> 00:30:06.510 align:middle line:84%
by taking you into
depth of transformation

00:30:06.510 --> 00:30:09.020 align:middle line:84%
so that you calibrate
with that placement,

00:30:09.020 --> 00:30:11.120 align:middle line:84%
calibrate your masculine
and your feminine

00:30:11.120 --> 00:30:13.050 align:middle line:90%
through your relationships.

00:30:13.050 --> 00:30:15.410 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So the Boomers
started pointing fingers

00:30:15.410 --> 00:30:17.030 align:middle line:90%
at Millennials and vice versa.

00:30:17.030 --> 00:30:18.140 align:middle line:90%
>> ARNÚS-ARRAUT: Yeah.

00:30:18.140 --> 00:30:20.000 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Gen X got
skipped altogether.

00:30:20.000 --> 00:30:22.100 align:middle line:90%
It's like, I'm sorry.

00:30:22.100 --> 00:30:25.340 align:middle line:84%
Well, back when, they were
called the slacker generation.

00:30:25.340 --> 00:30:27.380 align:middle line:90%
They weren't known for anything.

00:30:27.380 --> 00:30:30.050 align:middle line:84%
Yet you say this brought
a big relationship

00:30:30.050 --> 00:30:31.280 align:middle line:90%
to health and well-being.

00:30:31.280 --> 00:30:33.708 align:middle line:84%
And just maybe it just
wasn't sexy enough

00:30:33.708 --> 00:30:35.000 align:middle line:90%
that it was known for anything.

00:30:35.000 --> 00:30:37.520 align:middle line:84%
And maybe some of the
Boomer opportunities

00:30:37.520 --> 00:30:40.460 align:middle line:84%
were starting to die
back a bit, because that

00:30:40.460 --> 00:30:42.720 align:middle line:90%
was extreme expansion.

00:30:42.720 --> 00:30:46.000 align:middle line:84%
So maybe by the time
the Xers became adults,

00:30:46.000 --> 00:30:47.750 align:middle line:90%
it wasn't as expansive.

00:30:47.750 --> 00:30:49.800 align:middle line:84%
It was a little harder
to make things work,

00:30:49.800 --> 00:30:51.930 align:middle line:84%
and so maybe people
took it a little easier.

00:30:51.930 --> 00:30:52.970 align:middle line:90%
I don't know.

00:30:52.970 --> 00:30:55.220 align:middle line:90%
But let's just skip now then.

00:30:55.220 --> 00:30:56.500 align:middle line:90%
So we have Millennials.

00:30:56.500 --> 00:31:01.460 align:middle line:84%
And so the Boomers are saying,
they are so entitled and lazy.

00:31:01.460 --> 00:31:03.810 align:middle line:90%
Well, we raised them.

00:31:03.810 --> 00:31:04.810 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHS]

00:31:04.810 --> 00:31:06.440 align:middle line:90%
So let's talk about that.

00:31:06.440 --> 00:31:08.210 align:middle line:84%
>> ARNÚS-ARRAUT: Because my
parents are both Boomers, so.

00:31:08.210 --> 00:31:09.010 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Exactly.

00:31:09.010 --> 00:31:11.030 align:middle line:84%
We raised you
guys, and we wanted

00:31:11.030 --> 00:31:13.760 align:middle line:84%
you to have it a little easier
than our tough Depression era

00:31:13.760 --> 00:31:14.810 align:middle line:90%
parents.

00:31:14.810 --> 00:31:17.210 align:middle line:84%
That was the beginning of
compassion and everyone

00:31:17.210 --> 00:31:20.880 align:middle line:84%
getting a gold star, as
they say, in cliche terms.

00:31:20.880 --> 00:31:23.870 align:middle line:84%
So let's talk
about that dynamic.

00:31:23.870 --> 00:31:26.570 align:middle line:84%
>> ARNÚS-ARRAUT: Well, we need
to understand also what was

00:31:26.570 --> 00:31:28.520 align:middle line:90%
coming after the Pluto in Libra.

00:31:28.520 --> 00:31:30.710 align:middle line:90%
Why is this really powerful?

00:31:30.710 --> 00:31:33.740 align:middle line:84%
Why is this a generation
that pretty much transforms

00:31:33.740 --> 00:31:34.940 align:middle line:90%
everything?

00:31:34.940 --> 00:31:38.990 align:middle line:84%
Because Scorpio is the
home residence of Pluto.

00:31:38.990 --> 00:31:40.820 align:middle line:90%
Pluto rules over Scorpio.

00:31:40.820 --> 00:31:46.130 align:middle line:84%
And Scorpio is where Pluto,
when Pluto gets there,

00:31:46.130 --> 00:31:48.500 align:middle line:84%
it's almost like
where it experience

00:31:48.500 --> 00:31:50.690 align:middle line:90%
a death and a rebirth.

00:31:50.690 --> 00:31:56.570 align:middle line:84%
So it's depth, it's sexuality,
it's intimacy, it's fears,

00:31:56.570 --> 00:32:00.800 align:middle line:84%
it's the occult. A desire
to go for the occult.

00:32:00.800 --> 00:32:02.960 align:middle line:84%
And what I find
very interesting is

00:32:02.960 --> 00:32:06.140 align:middle line:84%
that when Pluto moved into
Scorpio, Millennials were born.

00:32:06.140 --> 00:32:10.640 align:middle line:84%
And is when we started
having the fear of sexuality

00:32:10.640 --> 00:32:12.400 align:middle line:90%
because of sexual illnesses.

00:32:12.400 --> 00:32:15.740 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And this is when the
whole movement toward incels

00:32:15.740 --> 00:32:17.990 align:middle line:90%
and such started.

00:32:17.990 --> 00:32:19.760 align:middle line:84%
And also the development
of technology.

00:32:19.760 --> 00:32:22.820 align:middle line:84%
I mean, these things obviously
happen simultaneously.

00:32:22.820 --> 00:32:25.010 align:middle line:84%
Technology comes
in to substitute

00:32:25.010 --> 00:32:28.250 align:middle line:84%
flesh-to-flesh,
face-to-face relationships.

00:32:28.250 --> 00:32:30.950 align:middle line:84%
At the same time, it's
indicated that there's

00:32:30.950 --> 00:32:33.813 align:middle line:84%
going to be more of a
fear of relationship.

00:32:33.813 --> 00:32:34.730 align:middle line:90%
>> ARNÚS-ARRAUT: Yeah.

00:32:34.730 --> 00:32:36.290 align:middle line:90%
Fear of intimacy.

00:32:36.290 --> 00:32:37.910 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Intimacy, yeah.

00:32:37.910 --> 00:32:40.220 align:middle line:84%
>> ARNÚS-ARRAUT: So,
I mean, it's part

00:32:40.220 --> 00:32:43.130 align:middle line:90%
of the Millennials' process.

00:32:43.130 --> 00:32:47.690 align:middle line:84%
But that's why Millennials
hold a very key role.

00:32:47.690 --> 00:32:52.580 align:middle line:84%
Because Gen Z, which is
the following generation,

00:32:52.580 --> 00:32:56.240 align:middle line:90%
is completely unattached.

00:32:56.240 --> 00:33:02.770 align:middle line:84%
And it's very based on that
Millennials were so deep.

00:33:02.770 --> 00:33:07.840 align:middle line:84%
So, so looking forward
to connect deeply because

00:33:07.840 --> 00:33:09.640 align:middle line:90%
of that Pluto connection.

00:33:09.640 --> 00:33:13.720 align:middle line:84%
And then finding that so
scary at the same time because

00:33:13.720 --> 00:33:16.360 align:middle line:90%
of emotional dependency.

00:33:16.360 --> 00:33:19.810 align:middle line:84%
So yeah, we have
Pluto in Scorpio,

00:33:19.810 --> 00:33:23.140 align:middle line:84%
which represent
holding a lot of power,

00:33:23.140 --> 00:33:26.980 align:middle line:84%
holding a lot of depth
and emotional intensity.

00:33:26.980 --> 00:33:29.920 align:middle line:84%
And it's when
therapy started to be

00:33:29.920 --> 00:33:32.320 align:middle line:84%
a little more known
or a little more

00:33:32.320 --> 00:33:34.960 align:middle line:84%
like-- it's a little
normal to go to therapy.

00:33:34.960 --> 00:33:37.630 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Therapy started, but
also, in a less healthy way,

00:33:37.630 --> 00:33:39.670 align:middle line:84%
a lot of division
came with that.

00:33:39.670 --> 00:33:43.270 align:middle line:84%
A lot of blaming of others
because of their perspectives.

00:33:43.270 --> 00:33:44.663 align:middle line:90%
A lot of social propriety.

00:33:44.663 --> 00:33:45.580 align:middle line:90%
>> ARNÚS-ARRAUT: Yeah.

00:33:45.580 --> 00:33:49.060 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: What is the indicating
factor of why that happened?

00:33:49.060 --> 00:33:52.700 align:middle line:84%
>> ARNÚS-ARRAUT: So I feel this
is very much where we're going

00:33:52.700 --> 00:33:53.500 align:middle line:90%
forward.

00:33:53.500 --> 00:33:59.050 align:middle line:84%
Because in a way, it's making
us very afraid of seeing

00:33:59.050 --> 00:34:00.860 align:middle line:90%
who we truly are.

00:34:00.860 --> 00:34:08.139 align:middle line:84%
So people are looking for almost
like a tag to be protected by.

00:34:08.139 --> 00:34:10.443 align:middle line:84%
And we see this a lot in
Gen Z. I have a very--

00:34:10.443 --> 00:34:11.860 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Yeah,
we're going there.

00:34:11.860 --> 00:34:12.460 align:middle line:90%
>> ARNÚS-ARRAUT: Yeah, I know.

00:34:12.460 --> 00:34:14.320 align:middle line:84%
I know, we're getting
ahead of ourselves.

00:34:14.320 --> 00:34:15.120 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:34:15.120 --> 00:34:20.980 align:middle line:84%
>> ARNÚS-ARRAUT: But I feel that
it all started there in a way

00:34:20.980 --> 00:34:25.690 align:middle line:84%
because of the clash of
Millennials in a way of looking

00:34:25.690 --> 00:34:29.320 align:middle line:84%
to move forward with
things that are too scary.

00:34:29.320 --> 00:34:32.900 align:middle line:84%
And what is too scary
is to go within.

00:34:32.900 --> 00:34:39.130 align:middle line:84%
So that's why Pluto in Scorpio
holders hold a lot of power.

00:34:39.130 --> 00:34:41.883 align:middle line:84%
But at the same time, it's
the generation Millennials.

00:34:41.883 --> 00:34:44.050 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: A lot of fear and
rejection in there, too.

00:34:44.050 --> 00:34:45.300 align:middle line:90%
>> ARNÚS-ARRAUT: There you go.

00:34:45.300 --> 00:34:47.679 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So now we go to
Gen Z moving out of Scorpio.

00:34:47.679 --> 00:34:50.120 align:middle line:84%
And their oldest ones
are about 25 now.

00:34:50.120 --> 00:34:53.058 align:middle line:84%
So we go to Gen Z moving out
of Scorpio into Sagittarius.

00:34:53.058 --> 00:34:54.850 align:middle line:84%
>> ARNÚS-ARRAUT: So
Pluto into Sagittarius,

00:34:54.850 --> 00:34:57.350 align:middle line:84%
and it's very related to
what you were just saying.

00:34:57.350 --> 00:35:01.330 align:middle line:84%
Which is the
demolishing a system

00:35:01.330 --> 00:35:04.810 align:middle line:84%
of beliefs that is
no longer valid.

00:35:04.810 --> 00:35:06.460 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: See, I've
said this before.

00:35:06.460 --> 00:35:10.450 align:middle line:84%
I feel like the Z's are
going to be hugely impactful.

00:35:10.450 --> 00:35:13.030 align:middle line:84%
It's like they're here to
burn the house down so we

00:35:13.030 --> 00:35:14.170 align:middle line:90%
can start over.

00:35:14.170 --> 00:35:15.087 align:middle line:90%
>> ARNÚS-ARRAUT: Yeah.

00:35:15.087 --> 00:35:17.590 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Even though
Millennials bitch about the Z's

00:35:17.590 --> 00:35:18.390 align:middle line:90%
now.

00:35:18.390 --> 00:35:20.020 align:middle line:84%
Everyone's bitching
because they don't

00:35:20.020 --> 00:35:21.478 align:middle line:84%
seem to have the
kind of work ethic

00:35:21.478 --> 00:35:24.490 align:middle line:84%
that previous generations
may have had, for example,

00:35:24.490 --> 00:35:26.470 align:middle line:84%
and socially don't seem
to care too much what

00:35:26.470 --> 00:35:28.340 align:middle line:84%
their parents or
anyone else thinks.

00:35:28.340 --> 00:35:29.740 align:middle line:90%
So let's talk about that.

00:35:29.740 --> 00:35:32.910 align:middle line:84%
>> ARNÚS-ARRAUT: Well, they come
to demolish the way everything

00:35:32.910 --> 00:35:33.710 align:middle line:90%
was done.

00:35:33.710 --> 00:35:36.910 align:middle line:84%
Especially the way the
culture was doing things.

00:35:36.910 --> 00:35:39.070 align:middle line:90%
Society was moving on.

00:35:39.070 --> 00:35:42.250 align:middle line:84%
Because Gen Z, I'd even
include Pluto in Capricorn,

00:35:42.250 --> 00:35:44.900 align:middle line:90%
which goes from 2008 to 2024.

00:35:44.900 --> 00:35:45.700 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:35:45.700 --> 00:35:48.283 align:middle line:84%
>> ARNÚS-ARRAUT: And also, going
back to Pluto in Sagittarius,

00:35:48.283 --> 00:35:54.430 align:middle line:84%
'95 to 2008, I feel that
that's also when we had a lot

00:35:54.430 --> 00:35:57.010 align:middle line:90%
of extreme fanatism.

00:35:57.010 --> 00:35:58.660 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Fanaticism, yes.

00:35:58.660 --> 00:35:59.410 align:middle line:84%
>> ARNÚS-ARRAUT:
Extreme fanaticism.

00:35:59.410 --> 00:36:00.460 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Oh, absolutely.

00:36:00.460 --> 00:36:01.260 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:36:01.260 --> 00:36:02.780 align:middle line:90%
Very extreme beliefs.

00:36:02.780 --> 00:36:08.320 align:middle line:84%
So I personally see the Z's as
being the ones that will maybe

00:36:08.320 --> 00:36:12.880 align:middle line:84%
come complete the tearing
down of the old institutions

00:36:12.880 --> 00:36:15.550 align:middle line:90%
and such that don't serve us.

00:36:15.550 --> 00:36:17.993 align:middle line:84%
Revolution is always a
little raggedy and ugly.

00:36:17.993 --> 00:36:18.910 align:middle line:90%
>> ARNÚS-ARRAUT: Yeah.

00:36:18.910 --> 00:36:21.430 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And so we can
point fingers all we want.

00:36:21.430 --> 00:36:22.600 align:middle line:90%
But they're still kids.

00:36:22.600 --> 00:36:24.280 align:middle line:84%
As they get older
and come into power,

00:36:24.280 --> 00:36:27.650 align:middle line:84%
it'll be very interesting to see
how they use that Sagittarian

00:36:27.650 --> 00:36:28.450 align:middle line:90%
power.

00:36:28.450 --> 00:36:29.350 align:middle line:90%
We don't know yet.

00:36:29.350 --> 00:36:30.770 align:middle line:90%
They're too young.

00:36:30.770 --> 00:36:34.630 align:middle line:84%
And so now, even the
oldest Z's are giving birth

00:36:34.630 --> 00:36:38.920 align:middle line:84%
to the next generation, which
are going to be called--

00:36:38.920 --> 00:36:40.750 align:middle line:84%
I guess they're being
called the Alphas.

00:36:40.750 --> 00:36:41.980 align:middle line:90%
They're babies.

00:36:41.980 --> 00:36:43.900 align:middle line:84%
Now what generation
is that and what

00:36:43.900 --> 00:36:46.420 align:middle line:84%
will we-- so just because we're
looking at these big trends.

00:36:46.420 --> 00:36:49.750 align:middle line:84%
What will we expect to come
out of this Sagittarius

00:36:49.750 --> 00:36:53.050 align:middle line:90%
into Capricorn and Aquarius?

00:36:53.050 --> 00:36:56.230 align:middle line:84%
>> ARNÚS-ARRAUT: So Sagittarius
Pluto, as we just said,

00:36:56.230 --> 00:37:01.240 align:middle line:84%
it was when religion
started to lose power

00:37:01.240 --> 00:37:03.700 align:middle line:90%
because of terrorism.

00:37:03.700 --> 00:37:06.970 align:middle line:84%
And nobody wanted to
be so extreme anymore

00:37:06.970 --> 00:37:08.450 align:middle line:90%
with their belief system.

00:37:08.450 --> 00:37:11.320 align:middle line:84%
And that's the power
of that generation.

00:37:11.320 --> 00:37:14.950 align:middle line:84%
Demolishing beliefs that are
no longer suitable for us

00:37:14.950 --> 00:37:16.990 align:middle line:90%
as a culture, as a society.

00:37:16.990 --> 00:37:21.510 align:middle line:84%
Then moving on to the
Alphas, as you were saying.

00:37:21.510 --> 00:37:22.795 align:middle line:90%
That's Pluto in Capricorn.

00:37:22.795 --> 00:37:24.420 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So what
are they going to be?

00:37:24.420 --> 00:37:24.990 align:middle line:90%
They're babies.

00:37:24.990 --> 00:37:25.540 align:middle line:90%
They're young.

00:37:25.540 --> 00:37:26.590 align:middle line:90%
They're toddlers right now.

00:37:26.590 --> 00:37:27.590 align:middle line:90%
>> ARNÚS-ARRAUT: I know.

00:37:27.590 --> 00:37:30.600 align:middle line:84%
So Pluto in Capricorn
started in 2008.

00:37:30.600 --> 00:37:33.760 align:middle line:84%
That's when we had a big
collapse, financial collapse.

00:37:33.760 --> 00:37:34.560 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:37:34.560 --> 00:37:37.410 align:middle line:84%
>> ARNÚS-ARRAUT: So Pluto in
Capricorn, that generation,

00:37:37.410 --> 00:37:38.393 align:middle line:90%
that goes till 2024.

00:37:38.393 --> 00:37:39.310 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: That's true.

00:37:39.310 --> 00:37:40.410 align:middle line:90%
Some of them are teenagers now.

00:37:40.410 --> 00:37:41.210 align:middle line:90%
Yeah, right.

00:37:41.210 --> 00:37:42.870 align:middle line:84%
>> ARNÚS-ARRAUT:
That go till 2024.

00:37:42.870 --> 00:37:45.840 align:middle line:84%
I feel that what they're
going to be known for

00:37:45.840 --> 00:37:50.250 align:middle line:84%
is demolishing the
old ways of building.

00:37:50.250 --> 00:37:52.530 align:middle line:90%
Companies, financials.

00:37:52.530 --> 00:37:54.763 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: The institutions
that transform under them.

00:37:54.763 --> 00:37:55.680 align:middle line:90%
>> ARNÚS-ARRAUT: Yeah.

00:37:55.680 --> 00:37:56.820 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: And it's needed.

00:37:56.820 --> 00:37:58.450 align:middle line:90%
>> ARNÚS-ARRAUT: Government.

00:37:58.450 --> 00:38:02.010 align:middle line:84%
So that's why with
Pluto in Aquarius, which

00:38:02.010 --> 00:38:04.170 align:middle line:90%
is the upcoming generation--

00:38:04.170 --> 00:38:05.670 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: After 2025.

00:38:05.670 --> 00:38:11.610 align:middle line:84%
>> ARNÚS-ARRAUT: Yeah,
from 2024-2025, to 2044.

00:38:11.610 --> 00:38:14.520 align:middle line:84%
So it's a very long
Pluto transit, this one,

00:38:14.520 --> 00:38:16.830 align:middle line:90%
in comparison to the other ones.

00:38:16.830 --> 00:38:23.670 align:middle line:84%
But that's going to be
building a brand new society.

00:38:23.670 --> 00:38:24.540 align:middle line:90%
But a lot--

00:38:24.540 --> 00:38:26.482 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Back to where
we started, Aquarius.

00:38:26.482 --> 00:38:27.690 align:middle line:90%
>> ARNÚS-ARRAUT: Yes, I know.

00:38:27.690 --> 00:38:30.090 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Which is the
thought, the ability

00:38:30.090 --> 00:38:32.680 align:middle line:90%
to create new solutions.

00:38:32.680 --> 00:38:35.220 align:middle line:90%
Very finely tuned mind.

00:38:35.220 --> 00:38:37.690 align:middle line:84%
>> ARNÚS-ARRAUT: And it's
the code for evolution.

00:38:37.690 --> 00:38:43.410 align:middle line:84%
So the Alphas that went
from 2008 to 2024 or 2025

00:38:43.410 --> 00:38:45.450 align:middle line:84%
that Pluto moves into
Aquarius, they're

00:38:45.450 --> 00:38:48.480 align:middle line:84%
going to be responsible
for demolishing

00:38:48.480 --> 00:38:52.620 align:middle line:84%
old waste, old structures,
old ancestral patterns.

00:38:52.620 --> 00:38:55.620 align:middle line:84%
Demolishing the ways
their parents did things,

00:38:55.620 --> 00:38:57.240 align:middle line:90%
their grandparents did things.

00:38:57.240 --> 00:39:01.750 align:middle line:84%
And breaking free of a mold
that was too repressing.

00:39:01.750 --> 00:39:02.550 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Perfect.

00:39:02.550 --> 00:39:03.810 align:middle line:90%
It has to go that way.

00:39:03.810 --> 00:39:04.380 align:middle line:90%
>> ARNÚS-ARRAUT: Exactly.

00:39:04.380 --> 00:39:06.060 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And then
we're back to Aquarius.

00:39:06.060 --> 00:39:07.200 align:middle line:84%
>> ARNÚS-ARRAUT: And
we're back to Aquarius.

00:39:07.200 --> 00:39:08.408 align:middle line:90%
And it's interesting, Regina.

00:39:08.408 --> 00:39:10.607 align:middle line:84%
Because Aquarius is
the opposite of Leo,

00:39:10.607 --> 00:39:12.690 align:middle line:84%
which is where we started,
with the Baby Boomers--

00:39:12.690 --> 00:39:13.470 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: That's right.

00:39:13.470 --> 00:39:15.803 align:middle line:84%
>> ARNÚS-ARRAUT: So finishing
up with Pluto in Aquarius,

00:39:15.803 --> 00:39:19.500 align:middle line:84%
I feel it's amazing to
have these generations.

00:39:19.500 --> 00:39:22.260 align:middle line:84%
Because Pluto in
Aquarius, it's going

00:39:22.260 --> 00:39:25.770 align:middle line:84%
to be bringing an
opening to sexuality,

00:39:25.770 --> 00:39:28.080 align:middle line:90%
to matters of spirituality.

00:39:28.080 --> 00:39:32.610 align:middle line:84%
And it's making the
individual stand out because

00:39:32.610 --> 00:39:34.410 align:middle line:90%
of their own abilities.

00:39:34.410 --> 00:39:36.960 align:middle line:84%
That uniqueness that
makes us stand out

00:39:36.960 --> 00:39:40.590 align:middle line:84%
in the world, that is our soul,
that is our consciousness.

00:39:40.590 --> 00:39:43.950 align:middle line:84%
And in a way, it's a very big
awakening of consciousness.

00:39:43.950 --> 00:39:47.580 align:middle line:84%
But of course, Aquarius is
also the energy of technology,

00:39:47.580 --> 00:39:49.560 align:middle line:84%
and Pluto is the
energy of the shadow.

00:39:49.560 --> 00:39:55.170 align:middle line:84%
So in a way, Pluto in Aquarius
is showing us the hidden--

00:39:55.170 --> 00:39:56.580 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Potential dangers.

00:39:56.580 --> 00:39:57.300 align:middle line:90%
>> ARNÚS-ARRAUT: The-- yeah.

00:39:57.300 --> 00:39:59.530 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Through technology
if we choose that path.

00:39:59.530 --> 00:39:59.700 align:middle line:90%
>> ARNÚS-ARRAUT: Yeah.

00:39:59.700 --> 00:40:01.450 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: But again,
these are the choices

00:40:01.450 --> 00:40:03.340 align:middle line:84%
that will be made on a
collective soul level.

00:40:03.340 --> 00:40:03.660 align:middle line:84%
As to what our future
will look like.

00:40:03.660 --> 00:40:04.702 align:middle line:90%
>> ARNÚS-ARRAUT: Exactly.

00:40:04.702 --> 00:40:08.340 align:middle line:84%
And it's going to make us
be very fearful of what

00:40:08.340 --> 00:40:09.630 align:middle line:90%
the future can bring.

00:40:09.630 --> 00:40:11.790 align:middle line:84%
Because Aquarius holds
the key to the future.

00:40:11.790 --> 00:40:12.590 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:40:12.590 --> 00:40:16.770 align:middle line:84%
>> ARNÚS-ARRAUT: So we got to
be aware of creating a very

00:40:16.770 --> 00:40:20.070 align:middle line:84%
beautiful future and staying
positive when creating it

00:40:20.070 --> 00:40:21.900 align:middle line:90%
and not fall into fear.

00:40:21.900 --> 00:40:23.760 align:middle line:84%
I know a lot of people
who are very scared

00:40:23.760 --> 00:40:26.520 align:middle line:90%
nowadays of technology and AI.

00:40:26.520 --> 00:40:29.722 align:middle line:84%
And in a way, that's
Pluto in Aquarius for us.

00:40:29.722 --> 00:40:30.930 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: That's interesting.

00:40:30.930 --> 00:40:32.610 align:middle line:84%
And it's understandable,
because we're

00:40:32.610 --> 00:40:34.770 align:middle line:84%
seeing the detrimental
effects already.

00:40:34.770 --> 00:40:37.870 align:middle line:90%
However, it's not going away.

00:40:37.870 --> 00:40:42.270 align:middle line:84%
We created it, and we can use
it and have mastery over it

00:40:42.270 --> 00:40:43.650 align:middle line:90%
for our own use.

00:40:43.650 --> 00:40:45.750 align:middle line:84%
And that's going to be
really interesting to see

00:40:45.750 --> 00:40:46.900 align:middle line:90%
how we want to participate.

00:40:46.900 --> 00:40:48.960 align:middle line:84%
I know one thing that I'm
seeing a lot of people

00:40:48.960 --> 00:40:51.540 align:middle line:84%
do right now is--
what is it called?

00:40:51.540 --> 00:40:52.928 align:middle line:90%

00:40:52.928 --> 00:40:53.970 align:middle line:90%
>> ARNÚS-ARRAUT: ChatGPT?

00:40:53.970 --> 00:40:55.630 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah, ChatGPT, right.

00:40:55.630 --> 00:40:58.620 align:middle line:84%
And people who are like,
geez, I can just punch this in

00:40:58.620 --> 00:41:00.330 align:middle line:90%
and have it do it for me.

00:41:00.330 --> 00:41:01.230 align:middle line:90%
That's a choice.

00:41:01.230 --> 00:41:03.840 align:middle line:84%
But those choices, those
minor little choices,

00:41:03.840 --> 00:41:07.270 align:middle line:84%
are going to be huge in the
collective of the future.

00:41:07.270 --> 00:41:08.070 align:middle line:90%
I believe.

00:41:08.070 --> 00:41:09.237 align:middle line:90%
>> ARNÚS-ARRAUT: Absolutely.

00:41:09.237 --> 00:41:11.260 align:middle line:84%
Because Aquarius is
the collective mind.

00:41:11.260 --> 00:41:12.060 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:41:12.060 --> 00:41:14.640 align:middle line:84%
Do we stay engaged, or do
we give it over to a AI?

00:41:14.640 --> 00:41:15.720 align:middle line:90%
>> ARNÚS-ARRAUT: Exactly.

00:41:15.720 --> 00:41:16.520 align:middle line:90%
Exactly.

00:41:16.520 --> 00:41:20.320 align:middle line:84%
It's giving too much power
to technology over us.

00:41:20.320 --> 00:41:21.120 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:41:21.120 --> 00:41:23.400 align:middle line:84%
>> ARNÚS-ARRAUT: And we
are projecting our inner

00:41:23.400 --> 00:41:24.960 align:middle line:90%
technologies.

00:41:24.960 --> 00:41:26.700 align:middle line:84%
We're projecting our
inner technologies

00:41:26.700 --> 00:41:30.000 align:middle line:90%
on to our surroundings.

00:41:30.000 --> 00:41:31.290 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:41:31.290 --> 00:41:33.420 align:middle line:90%
Absolutely fascinating.

00:41:33.420 --> 00:41:35.460 align:middle line:84%
I'm so glad we had
this generational chat.

00:41:35.460 --> 00:41:38.910 align:middle line:84%
Because people need to see
the beauty and the reason

00:41:38.910 --> 00:41:41.430 align:middle line:84%
for what might be
perceived as chaos,

00:41:41.430 --> 00:41:44.470 align:middle line:84%
resistance, expansion,
fear, and all that.

00:41:44.470 --> 00:41:46.710 align:middle line:84%
And I think you did a
wonderful job articulating it.

00:41:46.710 --> 00:41:48.000 align:middle line:90%
So any final thoughts?

00:41:48.000 --> 00:41:49.450 align:middle line:90%
We're just about out of time.

00:41:49.450 --> 00:41:51.700 align:middle line:84%
>> ARNÚS-ARRAUT: I'd take
it back to the astral chart.

00:41:51.700 --> 00:41:53.910 align:middle line:84%
To take it back
to your evolution

00:41:53.910 --> 00:41:58.050 align:middle line:84%
and your growth as a
soul, as consciousness

00:41:58.050 --> 00:41:59.970 align:middle line:90%
living a human experience.

00:41:59.970 --> 00:42:06.330 align:middle line:84%
And I'd say to go a little
deeper into karmic astrology

00:42:06.330 --> 00:42:10.210 align:middle line:84%
to understand your purpose,
what you're here for.

00:42:10.210 --> 00:42:14.820 align:middle line:84%
And I'm also very fascinated
by relationships in astrology.

00:42:14.820 --> 00:42:18.270 align:middle line:84%
How is your chart combining
with another person's chart?

00:42:18.270 --> 00:42:21.540 align:middle line:84%
And it's one of my favorite
topics in astrology

00:42:21.540 --> 00:42:27.090 align:middle line:84%
to bring someone's energy
onto my map, my astral chart,

00:42:27.090 --> 00:42:28.350 align:middle line:90%
to see how they're helping me.

00:42:28.350 --> 00:42:29.850 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Because
you're each coming

00:42:29.850 --> 00:42:32.455 align:middle line:84%
from your own perspective,
as we said in the beginning.

00:42:32.455 --> 00:42:33.330 align:middle line:90%
>> ARNÚS-ARRAUT: Yes.

00:42:33.330 --> 00:42:35.122 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And that's
important to remember.

00:42:35.122 --> 00:42:37.773 align:middle line:84%
No two people are coming from
the exact same perspective.

00:42:37.773 --> 00:42:38.940 align:middle line:90%
>> ARNÚS-ARRAUT: Absolutely.

00:42:38.940 --> 00:42:39.270 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:42:39.270 --> 00:42:40.437 align:middle line:90%
>> ARNÚS-ARRAUT: Absolutely.

00:42:40.437 --> 00:42:45.510 align:middle line:10%
So seeing how that soul helps
me align to my evolution,

00:42:45.510 --> 00:42:49.650 align:middle line:10%
to my purpose, and to my
past life or other timelines'

00:42:49.650 --> 00:42:50.980 align:middle line:10%
experience.

00:42:50.980 --> 00:42:51.780 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Perfect.

00:42:51.780 --> 00:42:53.970 align:middle line:84%
Well, I'm sure you
have a lot of people

00:42:53.970 --> 00:42:56.970 align:middle line:84%
that look to you for
assistance on that level.

00:42:56.970 --> 00:42:58.350 align:middle line:90%
Do you do readings still?

00:42:58.350 --> 00:42:59.850 align:middle line:84%
>> ARNÚS-ARRAUT:
Yes, I do readings.

00:42:59.850 --> 00:43:01.140 align:middle line:10%
And I teach.

00:43:01.140 --> 00:43:03.525 align:middle line:10%
I teach people how to read
their own astral chart.

00:43:03.525 --> 00:43:05.380 align:middle line:10%
>>REGINA: Yeah, that's
even more powerful.

00:43:05.380 --> 00:43:06.120 align:middle line:90%
>> ARNÚS-ARRAUT: Absolutely.

00:43:06.120 --> 00:43:06.600 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Very good.

00:43:06.600 --> 00:43:08.280 align:middle line:84%
Well, it's been a
pleasure meeting you.

00:43:08.280 --> 00:43:11.250 align:middle line:84%
And I love the
articulation and grace

00:43:11.250 --> 00:43:13.568 align:middle line:84%
that you bring to the subject
as well as the intuition.

00:43:13.568 --> 00:43:15.360 align:middle line:84%
>> ARNÚS-ARRAUT: Thank
you so much, Regina.

00:43:15.360 --> 00:43:17.760 align:middle line:90%
I enjoyed it so much.

00:43:17.760 --> 00:43:19.300 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Fascinating
discussion.

00:43:19.300 --> 00:43:20.100 align:middle line:90%
I loved it.
