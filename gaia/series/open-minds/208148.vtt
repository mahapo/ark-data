BYNUM: Beginning with

00:00:11.370 --> 00:00:14.970 align:middle line:84%
the biological, paleontological,
archaeological reality

00:00:14.970 --> 00:00:16.710 align:middle line:84%
and the population
genetic reality

00:00:16.710 --> 00:00:19.500 align:middle line:84%
that Africa is the origin
of the human species,

00:00:19.500 --> 00:00:23.170 align:middle line:84%
Africa is also the origin
of human consciousness.

00:00:23.170 --> 00:00:25.050 align:middle line:84%
All the great
scientists of the world,

00:00:25.050 --> 00:00:28.740 align:middle line:84%
by the way, including
Einstein, acknowledge

00:00:28.740 --> 00:00:31.080 align:middle line:84%
that their great ideas
came from someplace

00:00:31.080 --> 00:00:33.360 align:middle line:84%
that was not associated
with their everyday mind.

00:00:33.360 --> 00:00:35.235 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA MEREDITH: Not
with the mental realm.

00:00:35.235 --> 00:00:38.130 align:middle line:84%
>>BYNUM: As odd as it may seem,
African Americans in the United

00:00:38.130 --> 00:00:41.520 align:middle line:84%
States are more
hopeful about America

00:00:41.520 --> 00:00:43.295 align:middle line:90%
than most white people are.

00:00:43.295 --> 00:00:44.170 align:middle line:90%
We don't really know.

00:00:44.170 --> 00:00:48.960 align:middle line:84%
All we know is that those
great female religions,

00:00:48.960 --> 00:00:50.280 align:middle line:90%
they were suppressed.

00:00:50.280 --> 00:00:53.820 align:middle line:84%
And the patriarchal
took over and dominated.

00:00:53.820 --> 00:00:58.110 align:middle line:84%
And the goal was to
dominate nature, including

00:00:58.110 --> 00:00:59.360 align:middle line:90%
the nature of females.

00:00:59.360 --> 00:01:06.390 align:middle line:90%


00:01:06.390 --> 00:01:08.430 align:middle line:10%
>>REGINA: Today's
guest, Dr. Bruce Bynum,

00:01:08.430 --> 00:01:11.880 align:middle line:10%
has authored a book titled "Our
African Unconscious," which

00:01:11.880 --> 00:01:14.790 align:middle line:10%
states that not only does the
human race flow from Africa,

00:01:14.790 --> 00:01:17.490 align:middle line:10%
but so do many of our world's
most profound spiritual

00:01:17.490 --> 00:01:18.960 align:middle line:10%
and religious practices.

00:01:18.960 --> 00:01:22.740 align:middle line:84%
However, modern colonialism has
repressed these contributions

00:01:22.740 --> 00:01:23.940 align:middle line:90%
from our awareness.

00:01:23.940 --> 00:01:26.910 align:middle line:84%
The result has been an
erasure and denigration

00:01:26.910 --> 00:01:30.810 align:middle line:84%
of dark-skinned people and their
wisdoms around the globe, which

00:01:30.810 --> 00:01:36.410 align:middle line:84%
now has to be reintroduced,
which now has to be reversed.

00:01:36.410 --> 00:01:38.130 align:middle line:84%
Thank you, Dr. Bynum,
for joining us.

00:01:38.130 --> 00:01:40.760 align:middle line:84%
I think some people will find
this conversation-- parts of it

00:01:40.760 --> 00:01:41.900 align:middle line:90%
controversial.

00:01:41.900 --> 00:01:43.610 align:middle line:90%
>>BYNUM: Yes, yes.

00:01:43.610 --> 00:01:46.632 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: But you're
really a profound thinker.

00:01:46.632 --> 00:01:48.590 align:middle line:84%
You've made great
contributions, because you're

00:01:48.590 --> 00:01:50.750 align:middle line:84%
looking at from a
spiritual point of view

00:01:50.750 --> 00:01:52.042 align:middle line:90%
and a scientific point of view.

00:01:52.042 --> 00:01:52.842 align:middle line:90%
>>BYNUM: Both.

00:01:52.842 --> 00:01:55.640 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Starting with our DNA,
moving toward what we just said

00:01:55.640 --> 00:01:58.430 align:middle line:84%
off camera, toward now
all of us embracing

00:01:58.430 --> 00:02:02.180 align:middle line:84%
and developing into
supramental awareness.

00:02:02.180 --> 00:02:05.270 align:middle line:84%
So first, tell us what
the destination is.

00:02:05.270 --> 00:02:07.520 align:middle line:90%
Tell us what supramental means.

00:02:07.520 --> 00:02:09.410 align:middle line:84%
And then we're going
to go back into the DNA

00:02:09.410 --> 00:02:10.289 align:middle line:90%
and start at the beginning.

00:02:10.289 --> 00:02:11.089 align:middle line:90%
>>BYNUM: OK.

00:02:11.089 --> 00:02:13.220 align:middle line:10%
Well, supramental means
that consciousness

00:02:13.220 --> 00:02:16.610 align:middle line:10%
that is emerging in
us as a species that

00:02:16.610 --> 00:02:20.000 align:middle line:10%
is an evolutionary phenomenon
that goes from the time

00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:22.490 align:middle line:10%
that we were quote,
unquote, "primitive"

00:02:22.490 --> 00:02:26.450 align:middle line:10%
but relatively balanced
beings on the planet

00:02:26.450 --> 00:02:28.910 align:middle line:10%
for hundreds of
thousands of years.

00:02:28.910 --> 00:02:30.740 align:middle line:84%
And then we gradually
clawed our way

00:02:30.740 --> 00:02:33.260 align:middle line:84%
up to mental consciousness,
which is where most of us

00:02:33.260 --> 00:02:34.530 align:middle line:90%
are today.

00:02:34.530 --> 00:02:40.310 align:middle line:84%
But we also sense from not only
our scientific to some extent

00:02:40.310 --> 00:02:43.970 align:middle line:84%
but also our intuitive
and spiritual intuition

00:02:43.970 --> 00:02:46.970 align:middle line:84%
and consciousness that
there's something beyond that.

00:02:46.970 --> 00:02:50.300 align:middle line:84%
And we see that mostly when
we're in creative states,

00:02:50.300 --> 00:02:55.280 align:middle line:84%
intensity, sometimes when we are
in deep nurturing experiences,

00:02:55.280 --> 00:02:57.140 align:middle line:84%
childbirth experiences
is another one

00:02:57.140 --> 00:02:59.210 align:middle line:84%
of those indications
that there is something--

00:02:59.210 --> 00:03:00.680 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: An ecstatic
state almost.

00:03:00.680 --> 00:03:01.960 align:middle line:90%
>>BYNUM: And in static states.

00:03:01.960 --> 00:03:02.760 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

00:03:02.760 --> 00:03:06.710 align:middle line:84%
And then that consciousness is
a supramental consciousness.

00:03:06.710 --> 00:03:09.840 align:middle line:84%
And all the great scientists
of the world, by the way,

00:03:09.840 --> 00:03:14.240 align:middle line:84%
including Einstein acknowledged
that their great ideas

00:03:14.240 --> 00:03:16.220 align:middle line:84%
came from someplace
that was not associated

00:03:16.220 --> 00:03:17.390 align:middle line:90%
with their everyday mind.

00:03:17.390 --> 00:03:18.440 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Not with
the mental realm.

00:03:18.440 --> 00:03:19.280 align:middle line:84%
>>BYNUM: Not with
the mental realm.

00:03:19.280 --> 00:03:21.030 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Interpreted
by the mental realm,

00:03:21.030 --> 00:03:22.800 align:middle line:90%
but it didn't originate.

00:03:22.800 --> 00:03:26.330 align:middle line:84%
>>BYNUM: It descended, so
to speak, from higher order

00:03:26.330 --> 00:03:32.360 align:middle line:84%
enfolded consciousness that
begins in our mother's womb,

00:03:32.360 --> 00:03:35.330 align:middle line:84%
from the beginning of
embryology, stimulated

00:03:35.330 --> 00:03:42.470 align:middle line:84%
by an unfolding neural current
in the womb that begins

00:03:42.470 --> 00:03:47.620 align:middle line:84%
progressively more articulated
such that organs follow out

00:03:47.620 --> 00:03:51.640 align:middle line:84%
of that such that by the
time the fetus is ready,

00:03:51.640 --> 00:03:56.860 align:middle line:84%
it comes out, and it is on
some level already conscious.

00:03:56.860 --> 00:03:59.060 align:middle line:84%
We don't become conscious
all of the sudden, boom.

00:03:59.060 --> 00:03:59.860 align:middle line:90%
We're born.

00:03:59.860 --> 00:04:00.600 align:middle line:90%
Oh, we're conscious.

00:04:00.600 --> 00:04:01.400 align:middle line:90%
No.

00:04:01.400 --> 00:04:05.050 align:middle line:84%
We are conscious for some period
of time before we're born,

00:04:05.050 --> 00:04:07.930 align:middle line:84%
and we also know that we are
conscious for some period

00:04:07.930 --> 00:04:10.190 align:middle line:84%
of time even after we
are clinically dead.

00:04:10.190 --> 00:04:10.990 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:04:10.990 --> 00:04:12.270 align:middle line:84%
>>BYNUM: All the
near-death studies.

00:04:12.270 --> 00:04:12.670 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:04:12.670 --> 00:04:15.020 align:middle line:84%
And our audience is very
comfortable with all of this.

00:04:15.020 --> 00:04:15.820 align:middle line:90%
>>BYNUM: Right.

00:04:15.820 --> 00:04:19.360 align:middle line:84%
So we're conscious before
we're born to some extent,

00:04:19.360 --> 00:04:22.420 align:middle line:84%
and sometimes we're conscious
after we are dead, after we're

00:04:22.420 --> 00:04:23.980 align:middle line:90%
dead clinically for some while.

00:04:23.980 --> 00:04:26.313 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: But then you've got
that problem of everything

00:04:26.313 --> 00:04:28.360 align:middle line:84%
in between, which
is our life, which

00:04:28.360 --> 00:04:30.400 align:middle line:84%
is where we're in that
mental state which

00:04:30.400 --> 00:04:33.578 align:middle line:84%
has created massive division
and other things on this planet.

00:04:33.578 --> 00:04:34.870 align:middle line:90%
We'll get to that a little bit.

00:04:34.870 --> 00:04:38.710 align:middle line:84%
But let's start off with the
origin, the DNA, and evidence

00:04:38.710 --> 00:04:42.190 align:middle line:84%
of the DNA around
the globe, that there

00:04:42.190 --> 00:04:47.980 align:middle line:84%
was one primary physical
structure, architecture species

00:04:47.980 --> 00:04:51.173 align:middle line:84%
that then moved out
and started evolving

00:04:51.173 --> 00:04:53.590 align:middle line:84%
in different patterns, different
ways, different cultures.

00:04:53.590 --> 00:04:54.100 align:middle line:90%
>>BYNUM: Yes.

00:04:54.100 --> 00:04:56.500 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So we've heard of
it in the most common sense

00:04:56.500 --> 00:04:58.360 align:middle line:84%
of Lucy, but let's
go more into it.

00:04:58.360 --> 00:05:00.540 align:middle line:84%
>>BYNUM: Yeah, Lucy
was one of the--

00:05:00.540 --> 00:05:02.980 align:middle line:84%
they were referred to
as Australopithecines.

00:05:02.980 --> 00:05:04.630 align:middle line:84%
Before her, there
were other creatures.

00:05:04.630 --> 00:05:05.650 align:middle line:90%
Primates.

00:05:05.650 --> 00:05:10.060 align:middle line:84%
They evolved mostly in
Africa, East and South Africa.

00:05:10.060 --> 00:05:12.290 align:middle line:84%
They lived for
millions of years.

00:05:12.290 --> 00:05:14.740 align:middle line:84%
And then about six,
eight million years ago,

00:05:14.740 --> 00:05:17.710 align:middle line:84%
we split off from that
line and began our move

00:05:17.710 --> 00:05:20.290 align:middle line:90%
toward where we are today.

00:05:20.290 --> 00:05:22.750 align:middle line:84%
Whole groups of
Australopithecines

00:05:22.750 --> 00:05:23.950 align:middle line:90%
were around for a while.

00:05:23.950 --> 00:05:26.560 align:middle line:84%
Lucy about three million
years ago was one.

00:05:26.560 --> 00:05:29.980 align:middle line:84%
And then out of her, we
eventually moved further.

00:05:29.980 --> 00:05:32.260 align:middle line:84%
We split off from those
Australopithecines

00:05:32.260 --> 00:05:33.880 align:middle line:90%
and became the homogeneous.

00:05:33.880 --> 00:05:37.195 align:middle line:84%
And then lots of those died
off until eventually we're

00:05:37.195 --> 00:05:39.490 align:middle line:84%
where we are today,
Homo sapiens sapiens.

00:05:39.490 --> 00:05:40.450 align:middle line:90%
And you know what?

00:05:40.450 --> 00:05:45.940 align:middle line:84%
We've only been around as Homo
sapiens sapiens, eh, 150,000--

00:05:45.940 --> 00:05:48.370 align:middle line:84%
conservative-- to
maybe 250,000 years.

00:05:48.370 --> 00:05:49.390 align:middle line:90%
Not that long.

00:05:49.390 --> 00:05:50.320 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:05:50.320 --> 00:05:54.600 align:middle line:84%
>>BYNUM: But even more
interesting than that is that

00:05:54.600 --> 00:05:59.130 align:middle line:84%
when we spread all
over the planet,

00:05:59.130 --> 00:06:03.320 align:middle line:84%
we looked pretty much
African for most--

00:06:03.320 --> 00:06:04.830 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: For a
long period of time.

00:06:04.830 --> 00:06:07.380 align:middle line:84%
>>BYNUM: Racial
diversification as we

00:06:07.380 --> 00:06:10.930 align:middle line:84%
think of it today only began
about 25,000 to 35,000 years

00:06:10.930 --> 00:06:11.730 align:middle line:90%
ago.

00:06:11.730 --> 00:06:14.772 align:middle line:84%
Before that time, we
all looked Africa-like.

00:06:14.772 --> 00:06:18.170 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Well, that
would make sense simply

00:06:18.170 --> 00:06:22.190 align:middle line:84%
in that if you're moving, it
takes a long time for evolution

00:06:22.190 --> 00:06:25.460 align:middle line:84%
to step in and have
a species adapt to.

00:06:25.460 --> 00:06:28.010 align:middle line:84%
Now this is, I want to
say for our audience,

00:06:28.010 --> 00:06:29.930 align:middle line:84%
not taking into
consideration any

00:06:29.930 --> 00:06:33.767 align:middle line:84%
of the esoteric kind of ideas
of how different races were

00:06:33.767 --> 00:06:34.850 align:middle line:90%
tinkered with or so forth.

00:06:34.850 --> 00:06:37.070 align:middle line:84%
We're going to be
sticking with DNA

00:06:37.070 --> 00:06:39.570 align:middle line:84%
and these migratory
patterns, and so forth.

00:06:39.570 --> 00:06:42.150 align:middle line:84%
So it takes a long time
to develop new traits out

00:06:42.150 --> 00:06:42.950 align:middle line:90%
of necessity.

00:06:42.950 --> 00:06:43.980 align:middle line:90%
>>BYNUM: Of necessity.

00:06:43.980 --> 00:06:44.780 align:middle line:90%
Necessity.

00:06:44.780 --> 00:06:46.160 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: So OK.

00:06:46.160 --> 00:06:48.660 align:middle line:84%
I want to go back
kind of to the cradle.

00:06:48.660 --> 00:06:52.430 align:middle line:84%
So here you have the original
human species, right?

00:06:52.430 --> 00:06:59.090 align:middle line:84%
And this species was
arguably the most in tune

00:06:59.090 --> 00:07:01.850 align:middle line:84%
with the planet that
we have ever seen,

00:07:01.850 --> 00:07:04.340 align:middle line:84%
because it was
born of the planet,

00:07:04.340 --> 00:07:05.863 align:middle line:90%
in harmony with the planet.

00:07:05.863 --> 00:07:07.280 align:middle line:84%
Knew what they
could take and what

00:07:07.280 --> 00:07:09.200 align:middle line:84%
they needed to give
back to the planet,

00:07:09.200 --> 00:07:12.170 align:middle line:84%
and had this native intuition
and intelligence that

00:07:12.170 --> 00:07:13.490 align:middle line:90%
knew how to live in harmony.

00:07:13.490 --> 00:07:15.260 align:middle line:84%
And as I was saying
to you off camera,

00:07:15.260 --> 00:07:18.215 align:middle line:84%
it was already a
fulsome existence.

00:07:18.215 --> 00:07:19.090 align:middle line:90%
>>BYNUM: Yes, it was.

00:07:19.090 --> 00:07:19.890 align:middle line:90%
It was.

00:07:19.890 --> 00:07:21.680 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: But
people are curious.

00:07:21.680 --> 00:07:22.500 align:middle line:90%
Things change.

00:07:22.500 --> 00:07:23.300 align:middle line:90%
We move on.

00:07:23.300 --> 00:07:26.330 align:middle line:84%
And like you said, we evolved
into this mental state.

00:07:26.330 --> 00:07:30.830 align:middle line:84%
Let's talk about what happened
from the original state

00:07:30.830 --> 00:07:34.100 align:middle line:84%
of living in harmony with Earth
and understanding her language

00:07:34.100 --> 00:07:36.230 align:middle line:90%
and vice versa.

00:07:36.230 --> 00:07:38.060 align:middle line:84%
What happened to
start propelling us

00:07:38.060 --> 00:07:41.000 align:middle line:84%
into this mental state and
these migration patterns?

00:07:41.000 --> 00:07:43.910 align:middle line:84%
>>BYNUM: Well, we
had to struggle

00:07:43.910 --> 00:07:46.040 align:middle line:90%
to become mental creatures.

00:07:46.040 --> 00:07:49.850 align:middle line:84%
And we were pulled, I
believe, by the forces

00:07:49.850 --> 00:07:52.790 align:middle line:84%
of evolution themselves
to develop a higher

00:07:52.790 --> 00:07:56.001 align:middle line:90%
state of consciousness.

00:07:56.001 --> 00:07:58.550 align:middle line:84%
We were certainly
more in harmony

00:07:58.550 --> 00:08:00.560 align:middle line:84%
with nature in
that fulsome period

00:08:00.560 --> 00:08:04.800 align:middle line:84%
that you're talking about, but
it was also a precarious time.

00:08:04.800 --> 00:08:08.600 align:middle line:84%
I mean, we were at the
mercy of wild beasts.

00:08:08.600 --> 00:08:11.140 align:middle line:90%
We could starve.

00:08:11.140 --> 00:08:15.260 align:middle line:90%
We could get lost.

00:08:15.260 --> 00:08:18.820 align:middle line:84%
And so we were, under the
impression of evolution,

00:08:18.820 --> 00:08:21.070 align:middle line:84%
continuing to develop
our faculties.

00:08:21.070 --> 00:08:25.670 align:middle line:84%
And we had to struggle to learn
how to reason, how to think,

00:08:25.670 --> 00:08:30.370 align:middle line:84%
how to gain control over nature,
which seemed quite precarious.

00:08:30.370 --> 00:08:32.140 align:middle line:84%
And we eventually
evolved the skill

00:08:32.140 --> 00:08:34.000 align:middle line:90%
of being mental creatures.

00:08:34.000 --> 00:08:43.059 align:middle line:84%
By mental creatures, I mean
ones who could reason, predict,

00:08:43.059 --> 00:08:46.145 align:middle line:90%
record, have memory, and--

00:08:46.145 --> 00:08:47.020 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Strategize.

00:08:47.020 --> 00:08:49.790 align:middle line:84%
>>BYNUM: Strategize, yes,
which was very important.

00:08:49.790 --> 00:08:52.840 align:middle line:84%
And then for
millennia after that

00:08:52.840 --> 00:08:55.690 align:middle line:84%
as we evolved into
more mental creatures,

00:08:55.690 --> 00:08:57.340 align:middle line:84%
we still lived in
peace and harmony,

00:08:57.340 --> 00:08:59.467 align:middle line:84%
but we were a more
secure species.

00:08:59.467 --> 00:09:00.550 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Talk about that.

00:09:00.550 --> 00:09:01.350 align:middle line:90%
>>BYNUM: We were.

00:09:01.350 --> 00:09:04.840 align:middle line:90%
We began to live in villages.

00:09:04.840 --> 00:09:11.290 align:middle line:84%
We began to recognize that
families could be extended.

00:09:11.290 --> 00:09:16.000 align:middle line:84%
And eventually, we began
to do something radical

00:09:16.000 --> 00:09:18.610 align:middle line:84%
during the period
of Neanderthals.

00:09:18.610 --> 00:09:21.618 align:middle line:90%
We began to bury our dead.

00:09:21.618 --> 00:09:23.410 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Tell us why
that was significant.

00:09:23.410 --> 00:09:26.870 align:middle line:84%
>>BYNUM: That was
significant because we

00:09:26.870 --> 00:09:31.010 align:middle line:84%
began to develop some sense
that something else was going on

00:09:31.010 --> 00:09:33.530 align:middle line:84%
in the world that
we couldn't quite

00:09:33.530 --> 00:09:35.197 align:middle line:90%
see that was very important.

00:09:35.197 --> 00:09:36.530 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Of a spiritual nature.

00:09:36.530 --> 00:09:38.240 align:middle line:90%
>>BYNUM: Of a spiritual nature.

00:09:38.240 --> 00:09:43.400 align:middle line:84%
And we began to take our
dead, sporadically at first,

00:09:43.400 --> 00:09:47.540 align:middle line:84%
but take our dead, and we
would bury them in the house,

00:09:47.540 --> 00:09:49.010 align:middle line:90%
underneath the house.

00:09:49.010 --> 00:09:52.700 align:middle line:84%
Eventually we buried them in
cemeteries and graveyards.

00:09:52.700 --> 00:09:56.720 align:middle line:84%
But we had some general sense
that there was something going

00:09:56.720 --> 00:09:59.240 align:middle line:84%
on in the universe
that we couldn't--

00:09:59.240 --> 00:10:00.740 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: That was
more than a body.

00:10:00.740 --> 00:10:02.198 align:middle line:84%
>>BYNUM: That was
more than a body.

00:10:02.198 --> 00:10:04.250 align:middle line:90%
And we knew it from our dreams.

00:10:04.250 --> 00:10:08.670 align:middle line:84%
We knew it because there
was the mystery of birth.

00:10:08.670 --> 00:10:16.400 align:middle line:84%
The female would create
a new form of life.

00:10:16.400 --> 00:10:17.957 align:middle line:90%
How does that happen?

00:10:17.957 --> 00:10:19.040 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Still a mystery.

00:10:19.040 --> 00:10:22.340 align:middle line:84%
>>BYNUM: It's still a mystery,
but it became codified,

00:10:22.340 --> 00:10:26.330 align:middle line:84%
and we began to have
organizations doing it.

00:10:26.330 --> 00:10:28.230 align:middle line:84%
And we did that for
thousands of years.

00:10:28.230 --> 00:10:35.060 align:middle line:84%
And then about 18,000-plus years
ago in the river valleys around

00:10:35.060 --> 00:10:39.770 align:middle line:84%
the Earth, beginning
in Africa 18,000 BC,

00:10:39.770 --> 00:10:42.500 align:middle line:84%
women started
noticing something.

00:10:42.500 --> 00:10:45.410 align:middle line:84%
They started noticing them
when we finished the hunting

00:10:45.410 --> 00:10:47.570 align:middle line:84%
gathering and we
threw the seeds away

00:10:47.570 --> 00:10:52.190 align:middle line:84%
that in these river
valleys, all of a sudden

00:10:52.190 --> 00:10:54.180 align:middle line:84%
those same plants
would come back.

00:10:54.180 --> 00:10:58.700 align:middle line:84%
And so she began to
notice, oh, there's that.

00:10:58.700 --> 00:11:02.000 align:middle line:84%
And that comes back
out of the soil again.

00:11:02.000 --> 00:11:05.390 align:middle line:90%
I have a cycle in my own body.

00:11:05.390 --> 00:11:08.090 align:middle line:90%
The moon seems to have cycles.

00:11:08.090 --> 00:11:11.540 align:middle line:84%
And that star up there seems
to periodically come around.

00:11:11.540 --> 00:11:14.120 align:middle line:84%
And she began to notice
these great cycles,

00:11:14.120 --> 00:11:21.050 align:middle line:84%
and that's the general
idea of a quantum leap

00:11:21.050 --> 00:11:22.430 align:middle line:90%
over spiritual consciousness.

00:11:22.430 --> 00:11:28.130 align:middle line:84%
Before that she noticed that
not only are the dead important

00:11:28.130 --> 00:11:30.590 align:middle line:84%
and we have to
take care of them,

00:11:30.590 --> 00:11:34.790 align:middle line:84%
but the dead somehow have
cycles involved with them.

00:11:34.790 --> 00:11:37.370 align:middle line:84%
And that's how she
began to experiment

00:11:37.370 --> 00:11:41.420 align:middle line:84%
with the idea, which is the
bedrock of many religions--

00:11:41.420 --> 00:11:42.420 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Reincarnation.

00:11:42.420 --> 00:11:47.910 align:middle line:84%
>>BYNUM: Reincarnation,
resurrection, rebirth.

00:11:47.910 --> 00:11:52.940 align:middle line:84%
And she played with that
for about 10,000 years

00:11:52.940 --> 00:11:55.940 align:middle line:84%
until the idea
became crystallized.

00:11:55.940 --> 00:11:57.830 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: What I'm
hearing you say,

00:11:57.830 --> 00:11:59.625 align:middle line:84%
as the men were
doing their thing--

00:11:59.625 --> 00:12:00.750 align:middle line:90%
>>BYNUM: Doing their thing.

00:12:00.750 --> 00:12:02.150 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: They're hunting,
they're gathering,

00:12:02.150 --> 00:12:03.920 align:middle line:84%
being the brave warriors,
raising their sons--

00:12:03.920 --> 00:12:04.920 align:middle line:90%
>>BYNUM: Killing things.

00:12:04.920 --> 00:12:09.410 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: --killing things,
the women were more still,

00:12:09.410 --> 00:12:13.550 align:middle line:84%
more steady at the center
of the life and the family

00:12:13.550 --> 00:12:15.950 align:middle line:84%
or even in the
tribe, and that they

00:12:15.950 --> 00:12:18.320 align:middle line:84%
were in more of a
mode of observation,

00:12:18.320 --> 00:12:21.750 align:middle line:84%
and they were in a position to
be more observant, in a sense.

00:12:21.750 --> 00:12:22.550 align:middle line:90%
>>BYNUM: Yes.

00:12:22.550 --> 00:12:23.990 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And over a
long period of time,

00:12:23.990 --> 00:12:26.130 align:middle line:84%
this observation started
planting these seeds

00:12:26.130 --> 00:12:27.240 align:middle line:90%
you're talking about.

00:12:27.240 --> 00:12:29.240 align:middle line:84%
So this results in
an understanding

00:12:29.240 --> 00:12:32.060 align:middle line:84%
of cycles of life, they
have consciousness to it.

00:12:32.060 --> 00:12:33.120 align:middle line:90%
>>BYNUM: That's right.

00:12:33.120 --> 00:12:33.920 align:middle line:90%
That's right.

00:12:33.920 --> 00:12:35.890 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Well,
that got co-opted.

00:12:35.890 --> 00:12:37.640 align:middle line:84%
No, you're the first
person that's come on

00:12:37.640 --> 00:12:41.870 align:middle line:84%
and said that really came as a
result of female observation,

00:12:41.870 --> 00:12:43.890 align:middle line:90%
participation, and stimulation.

00:12:43.890 --> 00:12:44.690 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:12:44.690 --> 00:12:45.290 align:middle line:90%
>>BYNUM: Yes.

00:12:45.290 --> 00:12:46.090 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: OK.

00:12:46.090 --> 00:12:48.620 align:middle line:84%
So we'll get into the
patriarchy thing in a minute.

00:12:48.620 --> 00:12:51.890 align:middle line:84%
But let's get back to
the spiritual-- some

00:12:51.890 --> 00:12:54.500 align:middle line:84%
of the spiritual
principles that came

00:12:54.500 --> 00:12:56.930 align:middle line:84%
with the original
African culture.

00:12:56.930 --> 00:12:59.300 align:middle line:84%
Let's start looking
at it as it develops

00:12:59.300 --> 00:13:02.300 align:middle line:84%
into what we call spiritual
practice, even religions.

00:13:02.300 --> 00:13:04.580 align:middle line:84%
And I'm going to use
the terms in your book.

00:13:04.580 --> 00:13:06.770 align:middle line:84%
And if you can please
explain what they are to us,

00:13:06.770 --> 00:13:11.660 align:middle line:84%
because this is intrinsic
to African original human--

00:13:11.660 --> 00:13:13.220 align:middle line:84%
the development
of consciousness.

00:13:13.220 --> 00:13:14.020 align:middle line:90%
>>BYNUM: Yes.

00:13:14.020 --> 00:13:16.920 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Ifa, ori and dafa.

00:13:16.920 --> 00:13:17.720 align:middle line:90%
>>BYNUM: Right.

00:13:17.720 --> 00:13:21.080 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Tell us what
these principles mean.

00:13:21.080 --> 00:13:24.800 align:middle line:84%
>>BYNUM: Well, beginning
with the biological,

00:13:24.800 --> 00:13:29.480 align:middle line:84%
paleontological, archaeological
reality and the population

00:13:29.480 --> 00:13:31.700 align:middle line:84%
genetic reality that
Africa is the origin

00:13:31.700 --> 00:13:35.360 align:middle line:84%
of the human
species, well, Africa

00:13:35.360 --> 00:13:38.600 align:middle line:84%
is also the origin of
human consciousness.

00:13:38.600 --> 00:13:40.460 align:middle line:90%
And out of that become--

00:13:40.460 --> 00:13:45.170 align:middle line:84%
developed our seminal intuitions
of spiritual relationship

00:13:45.170 --> 00:13:46.470 align:middle line:90%
of all kinds.

00:13:46.470 --> 00:13:47.390 align:middle line:90%
Of all kinds.

00:13:47.390 --> 00:13:49.940 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Beyond what you just
spoke about among the women.

00:13:49.940 --> 00:13:53.900 align:middle line:84%
>>BYNUM: Primarily among
women because the women had

00:13:53.900 --> 00:13:54.980 align:middle line:90%
the mystery within them.

00:13:54.980 --> 00:13:55.780 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:13:55.780 --> 00:13:58.430 align:middle line:84%
>>BYNUM: The men did not
have the mystery within them.

00:13:58.430 --> 00:14:00.840 align:middle line:84%
In fact, we didn't
figure out who

00:14:00.840 --> 00:14:04.240 align:middle line:84%
was the father of anybody
for a long period of time.

00:14:04.240 --> 00:14:05.615 align:middle line:84%
But you knew who
your mother was.

00:14:05.615 --> 00:14:06.560 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: You always knew.

00:14:06.560 --> 00:14:07.760 align:middle line:84%
>>BYNUM: You always knew
who your mother was.

00:14:07.760 --> 00:14:09.590 align:middle line:84%
You didn't necessarily
know who your father was.

00:14:09.590 --> 00:14:10.390 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:14:10.390 --> 00:14:13.250 align:middle line:84%
>>BYNUM: So women were the
ones who recognized this.

00:14:13.250 --> 00:14:14.990 align:middle line:90%
This was their genius.

00:14:14.990 --> 00:14:18.350 align:middle line:84%
And also, she was the
center of the family.

00:14:18.350 --> 00:14:21.590 align:middle line:84%
And the men also knew
that they would not

00:14:21.590 --> 00:14:26.050 align:middle line:84%
exist unless she existed
and she took care of them.

00:14:26.050 --> 00:14:28.377 align:middle line:84%
Really, really,
really important.

00:14:28.377 --> 00:14:29.960 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: This is
going to circle back

00:14:29.960 --> 00:14:32.070 align:middle line:84%
to haunt us a little
later in the conversation.

00:14:32.070 --> 00:14:32.870 align:middle line:90%
>>BYNUM: OK.

00:14:32.870 --> 00:14:37.400 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So right now, let's
go into those three terms

00:14:37.400 --> 00:14:40.040 align:middle line:84%
that I put out there as the
basis for the development

00:14:40.040 --> 00:14:41.750 align:middle line:84%
of our consciousness,
the understanding

00:14:41.750 --> 00:14:45.200 align:middle line:84%
that was there embedded
in African culture.

00:14:45.200 --> 00:14:47.640 align:middle line:84%
>>BYNUM: The ones that
you spoke of, of ifa--

00:14:47.640 --> 00:14:48.440 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Ifa.

00:14:48.440 --> 00:14:49.130 align:middle line:90%
>>BYNUM: Ifa.

00:14:49.130 --> 00:14:49.940 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Ori?

00:14:49.940 --> 00:14:51.110 align:middle line:90%
>>BYNUM: Ori.

00:14:51.110 --> 00:14:56.390 align:middle line:84%
Those are West African
religious phenomena

00:14:56.390 --> 00:14:59.270 align:middle line:84%
or words that apply to
some of the religions that

00:14:59.270 --> 00:15:02.840 align:middle line:90%
developed in West Africa.

00:15:02.840 --> 00:15:07.520 align:middle line:84%
We don't know exactly when, but
probably a few thousand years

00:15:07.520 --> 00:15:08.345 align:middle line:90%
before Christ.

00:15:08.345 --> 00:15:09.470 align:middle line:90%
We don't know exactly when.

00:15:09.470 --> 00:15:11.012 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Well,
explain the concepts,

00:15:11.012 --> 00:15:13.490 align:middle line:84%
because it's going to sound
awfully familiar to most of us.

00:15:13.490 --> 00:15:14.960 align:middle line:90%
>>BYNUM: OK.

00:15:14.960 --> 00:15:20.810 align:middle line:84%
Ifa is a divination
system, divination

00:15:20.810 --> 00:15:25.310 align:middle line:84%
meaning how to read
the Earth and how

00:15:25.310 --> 00:15:27.860 align:middle line:84%
to predict from
reading the Earth,

00:15:27.860 --> 00:15:32.820 align:middle line:84%
the oracles, how
things would proceed.

00:15:32.820 --> 00:15:38.270 align:middle line:84%
And so those are two particular
systems, dafa and ifa,

00:15:38.270 --> 00:15:41.930 align:middle line:84%
which are attempts to
successfully divine

00:15:41.930 --> 00:15:44.490 align:middle line:90%
how the Earth is emerging.

00:15:44.490 --> 00:15:49.080 align:middle line:84%
And-- not emerging,
but proceeding.

00:15:49.080 --> 00:15:55.310 align:middle line:84%
And so they became over time
very complex and sophisticated

00:15:55.310 --> 00:15:56.300 align:middle line:90%
systems.

00:15:56.300 --> 00:15:59.480 align:middle line:84%
A variation on the
theme is the I Ching.

00:15:59.480 --> 00:16:02.180 align:middle line:90%
That is another system.

00:16:02.180 --> 00:16:05.000 align:middle line:84%
That one developed
primarily in Mesopotamia

00:16:05.000 --> 00:16:10.280 align:middle line:90%
and then migrated over to China.

00:16:10.280 --> 00:16:15.190 align:middle line:84%
Ifa may have developed
in the interior of Africa

00:16:15.190 --> 00:16:19.043 align:middle line:84%
and along the Nile, and then
progressed, migrated over

00:16:19.043 --> 00:16:19.960 align:middle line:90%
to the west of Africa.

00:16:19.960 --> 00:16:21.040 align:middle line:90%
We really don't know.

00:16:21.040 --> 00:16:23.140 align:middle line:84%
We have some
linguistic suggestions,

00:16:23.140 --> 00:16:25.370 align:middle line:90%
but we honestly don't know.

00:16:25.370 --> 00:16:27.460 align:middle line:84%
All we know is that it
has developed there.

00:16:27.460 --> 00:16:28.720 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: And what's ori?

00:16:28.720 --> 00:16:34.270 align:middle line:84%
>>BYNUM: Ori, our ori is the
energy of the spirit that

00:16:34.270 --> 00:16:38.050 align:middle line:90%
resides literally in your head.

00:16:38.050 --> 00:16:42.070 align:middle line:84%
Many African systems, there
will be a statue or just

00:16:42.070 --> 00:16:42.970 align:middle line:90%
the figure--

00:16:42.970 --> 00:16:44.300 align:middle line:90%
the head of a person.

00:16:44.300 --> 00:16:47.680 align:middle line:84%
It means the energy
in your head.

00:16:47.680 --> 00:16:51.560 align:middle line:84%
Older people, the elders,
are thought to be, quote,

00:16:51.560 --> 00:16:53.170 align:middle line:90%
"strong in the head," unquote.

00:16:53.170 --> 00:16:55.630 align:middle line:90%
Their ori is strong.

00:16:55.630 --> 00:16:59.740 align:middle line:84%
And the nature of the process
of most spiritual traditions

00:16:59.740 --> 00:17:04.390 align:middle line:84%
around the Earth from Southeast
Asia to South America,

00:17:04.390 --> 00:17:07.780 align:middle line:84%
certainly Africa is
to raise the energy

00:17:07.780 --> 00:17:13.300 align:middle line:84%
up from the base of the body
all the way up through the body,

00:17:13.300 --> 00:17:14.980 align:middle line:84%
through various
spiritual disciplines,

00:17:14.980 --> 00:17:17.170 align:middle line:90%
to reside in the ori.

00:17:17.170 --> 00:17:19.390 align:middle line:84%
And that is where
one awakens into

00:17:19.390 --> 00:17:21.932 align:middle line:90%
a full spiritual consciousness.

00:17:21.932 --> 00:17:23.349 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Now at
some point, there

00:17:23.349 --> 00:17:26.240 align:middle line:84%
becomes even more of a
cosmic consciousness.

00:17:26.240 --> 00:17:27.400 align:middle line:90%
Awareness is now.

00:17:27.400 --> 00:17:28.990 align:middle line:84%
And today, most of
our audience has

00:17:28.990 --> 00:17:32.500 align:middle line:84%
heard of the Dogon
tribe and the connection

00:17:32.500 --> 00:17:36.020 align:middle line:84%
with the star ancestors
from Sirius, for example.

00:17:36.020 --> 00:17:38.830 align:middle line:84%
So let's talk about how
that started coming in

00:17:38.830 --> 00:17:41.830 align:middle line:84%
before we hop to
the first dynasty

00:17:41.830 --> 00:17:45.400 align:middle line:84%
in the Egyptian
pharaonic system, OK?

00:17:45.400 --> 00:17:47.710 align:middle line:84%
>>BYNUM: Well, the Dogon
trace their own ancestry

00:17:47.710 --> 00:17:50.350 align:middle line:84%
to pre-dynastic Egypt,
some of their ideas,

00:17:50.350 --> 00:17:52.570 align:middle line:84%
particularly with
the star Sirius.

00:17:52.570 --> 00:18:00.820 align:middle line:84%
And they were very aware of
the orbits of certain stars

00:18:00.820 --> 00:18:03.100 align:middle line:84%
without the aid of
telescopes, by the way,

00:18:03.100 --> 00:18:06.550 align:middle line:84%
very accurately for hundreds
and hundreds of years

00:18:06.550 --> 00:18:10.260 align:middle line:90%
before Western astronomy.

00:18:10.260 --> 00:18:12.840 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Which is really
credited to the Egyptians.

00:18:12.840 --> 00:18:14.910 align:middle line:90%
Also to the Persians and--

00:18:14.910 --> 00:18:16.980 align:middle line:84%
>>BYNUM: Well, they all
kind of knew about it,

00:18:16.980 --> 00:18:20.560 align:middle line:84%
and they were all trading
ideas back and forth.

00:18:20.560 --> 00:18:23.130 align:middle line:84%
But there is a
mysterious connection

00:18:23.130 --> 00:18:26.490 align:middle line:84%
between the star Sirius in
many spiritual traditions

00:18:26.490 --> 00:18:28.680 align:middle line:90%
and phenomena on Earth.

00:18:28.680 --> 00:18:30.840 align:middle line:84%
And the ancient
Egyptians knew about it,

00:18:30.840 --> 00:18:37.260 align:middle line:84%
and the ancient folks from
the Dogon tribe knew about it.

00:18:37.260 --> 00:18:39.450 align:middle line:90%
The Persians knew about it.

00:18:39.450 --> 00:18:41.370 align:middle line:84%
And very interestingly
enough, it

00:18:41.370 --> 00:18:44.760 align:middle line:84%
was connected to phenomena
in our own physical bodies.

00:18:44.760 --> 00:18:45.560 align:middle line:90%
All these things--

00:18:45.560 --> 00:18:45.840 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: How so?

00:18:45.840 --> 00:18:47.715 align:middle line:84%
>>BYNUM: Well, all these
spiritual traditions

00:18:47.715 --> 00:18:51.540 align:middle line:84%
that we're talking about
talked about raising energy

00:18:51.540 --> 00:18:54.750 align:middle line:84%
from the base of the body
through the spinal line

00:18:54.750 --> 00:18:55.740 align:middle line:90%
to the top of the head.

00:18:55.740 --> 00:18:58.140 align:middle line:84%
And each has its own
characteristic way

00:18:58.140 --> 00:18:59.160 align:middle line:90%
of expressing it.

00:18:59.160 --> 00:19:01.440 align:middle line:84%
But they're all the
same, and that's

00:19:01.440 --> 00:19:04.650 align:middle line:84%
because the human
brain is the same.

00:19:04.650 --> 00:19:08.940 align:middle line:84%
The human brain underneath
the skull is dark.

00:19:08.940 --> 00:19:10.920 align:middle line:90%
Why is the human brain dark?

00:19:10.920 --> 00:19:14.496 align:middle line:84%
Because it is full of
what-- a phenomena called--

00:19:14.496 --> 00:19:17.580 align:middle line:90%
a molecule called neuromelanin.

00:19:17.580 --> 00:19:19.260 align:middle line:84%
It's not the same
as skin melanin.

00:19:19.260 --> 00:19:20.180 align:middle line:90%
It's neuromelanin.

00:19:20.180 --> 00:19:23.010 align:middle line:84%
It's invariant
across our species.

00:19:23.010 --> 00:19:25.740 align:middle line:84%
Now why it's important
is that as we

00:19:25.740 --> 00:19:28.260 align:middle line:84%
evolve, as we move
through evolution,

00:19:28.260 --> 00:19:31.440 align:middle line:90%
the brain gets darker.

00:19:31.440 --> 00:19:33.720 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Why is that?

00:19:33.720 --> 00:19:35.430 align:middle line:84%
Does it mean more
saturated, more dense?

00:19:35.430 --> 00:19:38.190 align:middle line:84%
>>BYNUM: It means not only is
it more saturated, more dense,

00:19:38.190 --> 00:19:40.740 align:middle line:84%
but that density of
neuromelanin allows

00:19:40.740 --> 00:19:44.860 align:middle line:84%
it to absorb light,
absorbed quanta,

00:19:44.860 --> 00:19:48.510 align:middle line:84%
absorb it and transmute it to
higher states of awareness.

00:19:48.510 --> 00:19:52.020 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: This is probably the
first time we've heard of this.

00:19:52.020 --> 00:19:54.990 align:middle line:84%
>>BYNUM: Of all the
creatures on the Earth,

00:19:54.990 --> 00:19:57.870 align:middle line:84%
the ones who have the greatest
amount of neuromelanin

00:19:57.870 --> 00:20:01.780 align:middle line:90%
in their brains are the mammals.

00:20:01.780 --> 00:20:07.310 align:middle line:84%
Among the mammals, the ones with
the highest are the primates.

00:20:07.310 --> 00:20:10.340 align:middle line:84%
Among the primates, the
ones with the highest

00:20:10.340 --> 00:20:13.580 align:middle line:90%
are the great apes.

00:20:13.580 --> 00:20:17.930 align:middle line:84%
Of the great apes, the one
who has the highest, densest

00:20:17.930 --> 00:20:21.770 align:middle line:84%
concentration of this capacity
to absorb light and transform

00:20:21.770 --> 00:20:25.460 align:middle line:84%
it in their physical brain
are the chimps, chimpanzees.

00:20:25.460 --> 00:20:29.690 align:middle line:84%
And the only one with
more is our species, Homo

00:20:29.690 --> 00:20:30.860 align:middle line:90%
sapiens sapiens.

00:20:30.860 --> 00:20:34.250 align:middle line:84%
That's a pretty
tight correlation,

00:20:34.250 --> 00:20:36.530 align:middle line:84%
and it's an
evolutionary phenomenon.

00:20:36.530 --> 00:20:40.790 align:middle line:84%
And evolution is not like the
laws that govern supposedly

00:20:40.790 --> 00:20:46.520 align:middle line:84%
the cosmos where things become
more disordered as things

00:20:46.520 --> 00:20:48.000 align:middle line:90%
progress.

00:20:48.000 --> 00:20:49.380 align:middle line:90%
In other words, entropy.

00:20:49.380 --> 00:20:50.180 align:middle line:90%
No.

00:20:50.180 --> 00:20:52.680 align:middle line:90%
Evolution is negative entropy.

00:20:52.680 --> 00:20:55.880 align:middle line:84%
Things get more complex,
more sophisticated,

00:20:55.880 --> 00:20:58.010 align:middle line:84%
and we're intimately
associated with that.

00:20:58.010 --> 00:21:00.620 align:middle line:84%
And all of our
spiritual traditions

00:21:00.620 --> 00:21:04.100 align:middle line:84%
are about tuning
into that, harnessing

00:21:04.100 --> 00:21:07.250 align:middle line:84%
that in various ways,
and bringing that up.

00:21:07.250 --> 00:21:10.670 align:middle line:84%
And all of our great
religions began with women.

00:21:10.670 --> 00:21:11.840 align:middle line:90%
They all did.

00:21:11.840 --> 00:21:13.640 align:middle line:90%
There are no exceptions to that.

00:21:13.640 --> 00:21:17.210 align:middle line:84%
And that was pretty much the
dominant systems throughout all

00:21:17.210 --> 00:21:23.390 align:middle line:84%
the continents
until about, eh, I'd

00:21:23.390 --> 00:21:28.420 align:middle line:84%
say 8,000, 10,000
years ago maybe.

00:21:28.420 --> 00:21:29.220 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: OK.

00:21:29.220 --> 00:21:31.710 align:middle line:84%
Now that turns into something
interesting date-wise,

00:21:31.710 --> 00:21:35.370 align:middle line:84%
because now we're coming into
a series of floods, a series

00:21:35.370 --> 00:21:36.870 align:middle line:90%
of annihilations, so to speak.

00:21:36.870 --> 00:21:39.987 align:middle line:84%
Loss of populations, loss
of cultures, and so forth.

00:21:39.987 --> 00:21:41.070 align:middle line:90%
>>BYNUM: Famines, plagues.

00:21:41.070 --> 00:21:42.910 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Famines,
plagues, and all that.

00:21:42.910 --> 00:21:48.450 align:middle line:84%
So now coming out of that,
that feminine, observational,

00:21:48.450 --> 00:21:50.850 align:middle line:84%
connected mode is
starting to be replaced

00:21:50.850 --> 00:21:53.100 align:middle line:84%
with something more
primal, more fear-based,

00:21:53.100 --> 00:21:55.058 align:middle line:90%
more survival-based.

00:21:55.058 --> 00:21:56.850 align:middle line:84%
So talk about that for
a minute, and then I

00:21:56.850 --> 00:21:59.430 align:middle line:84%
want to get over to Egypt,
because a lot of people

00:21:59.430 --> 00:22:02.140 align:middle line:84%
don't think of Egypt as
being part of Africa, right?

00:22:02.140 --> 00:22:04.083 align:middle line:84%
>>BYNUM: Well,
last time I looked.

00:22:04.083 --> 00:22:06.000 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: I know, but
you see what I'm saying.

00:22:06.000 --> 00:22:06.800 align:middle line:90%
It's like, oh, no.

00:22:06.800 --> 00:22:08.950 align:middle line:84%
That was Egyptian culture,
not African culture.

00:22:08.950 --> 00:22:11.100 align:middle line:84%
So we're going to move
up into Africa starting

00:22:11.100 --> 00:22:13.530 align:middle line:84%
with the first dynasty
and move through something

00:22:13.530 --> 00:22:14.910 align:middle line:90%
in the 18th dynasty.

00:22:14.910 --> 00:22:16.590 align:middle line:84%
Then we're going to
move to colonialism,

00:22:16.590 --> 00:22:18.305 align:middle line:84%
because that's where
we've got to go.

00:22:18.305 --> 00:22:19.680 align:middle line:84%
So let's talk
about what happened

00:22:19.680 --> 00:22:21.600 align:middle line:84%
after these floods and
destruction of culture

00:22:21.600 --> 00:22:21.870 align:middle line:90%
and life.

00:22:21.870 --> 00:22:24.360 align:middle line:84%
>>BYNUM: Well, there were a
lot of floods and destructions

00:22:24.360 --> 00:22:26.408 align:middle line:84%
that wiped out
civilizations, some of which

00:22:26.408 --> 00:22:27.450 align:middle line:90%
we don't even know about.

00:22:27.450 --> 00:22:32.790 align:middle line:84%
At one time the Sahara, which
is now dry and arid, was lush.

00:22:32.790 --> 00:22:37.890 align:middle line:84%
And satellite technologies
revealed rivers and lakes

00:22:37.890 --> 00:22:40.530 align:middle line:84%
all connected through
all the Saharan Africa.

00:22:40.530 --> 00:22:44.920 align:middle line:84%
Well, when the Sahara
started drying up,

00:22:44.920 --> 00:22:48.520 align:middle line:84%
people from West Africa
and Highlands of Ethiopia

00:22:48.520 --> 00:22:52.450 align:middle line:90%
began to migrate down the Nile.

00:22:52.450 --> 00:22:55.360 align:middle line:84%
And there you have
people who are primarily

00:22:55.360 --> 00:22:58.600 align:middle line:84%
what we would today
call Nubian or Sudanese

00:22:58.600 --> 00:23:01.750 align:middle line:90%
and people who are Egyptians.

00:23:01.750 --> 00:23:05.710 align:middle line:84%
Not Arab Egyptians, but the
Indigenous Egyptians sort

00:23:05.710 --> 00:23:07.060 align:middle line:90%
of cross-fertilizing--

00:23:07.060 --> 00:23:10.100 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Nubians and Indigenous
Egyptians creating a culture.

00:23:10.100 --> 00:23:12.460 align:middle line:84%
>>BYNUM: Creating a culture
that lasted for thousands

00:23:12.460 --> 00:23:13.510 align:middle line:90%
of years unbroken.

00:23:13.510 --> 00:23:15.460 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Was that the beginning
of the dynastic culture?

00:23:15.460 --> 00:23:17.502 align:middle line:84%
>>BYNUM: That's the
beginning of dynastic culture

00:23:17.502 --> 00:23:18.340 align:middle line:90%
that we know about.

00:23:18.340 --> 00:23:22.840 align:middle line:84%
However, the ancient
Egyptians denotes about, eh,

00:23:22.840 --> 00:23:26.840 align:middle line:84%
beginning of around 4,000 or
5,000 years before Christ.

00:23:26.840 --> 00:23:29.940 align:middle line:84%
The ancient Kemetic
Egyptians, however,

00:23:29.940 --> 00:23:34.090 align:middle line:84%
date their civilization
to 10,500 BC.

00:23:34.090 --> 00:23:34.920 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Mm-hmm.

00:23:34.920 --> 00:23:37.530 align:middle line:90%
Well, we know that--

00:23:37.530 --> 00:23:39.930 align:middle line:84%
everything that we know
about archaeological and some

00:23:39.930 --> 00:23:42.787 align:middle line:84%
of these great structures at
this point is speculation.

00:23:42.787 --> 00:23:44.370 align:middle line:84%
>>BYNUM: There's a
lot of speculation.

00:23:44.370 --> 00:23:46.980 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: I've interviewed--
I mean, everyone at Gaia

00:23:46.980 --> 00:23:49.650 align:middle line:84%
here has heard of Robert Schoch
and a lot of other people.

00:23:49.650 --> 00:23:51.960 align:middle line:84%
And Robert privately
says that the pyramid

00:23:51.960 --> 00:23:54.420 align:middle line:84%
appears to be more
like 100,000 years old.

00:23:54.420 --> 00:23:56.700 align:middle line:84%
>>BYNUM: It may very well
be, because it's stone.

00:23:56.700 --> 00:23:57.880 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Exactly, exactly.

00:23:57.880 --> 00:23:59.490 align:middle line:84%
So that means we've
had culture that

00:23:59.490 --> 00:24:02.700 align:middle line:84%
was sophisticated and capable
of this mental plane and

00:24:02.700 --> 00:24:04.590 align:middle line:84%
>>BYNUM: Rises and
falls, rises and falls.

00:24:04.590 --> 00:24:05.470 align:middle line:90%
We're an old species.

00:24:05.470 --> 00:24:06.270 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:24:06.270 --> 00:24:07.410 align:middle line:90%
So now we go to--

00:24:07.410 --> 00:24:09.030 align:middle line:90%
you say roughly 8,000 years ago.

00:24:09.030 --> 00:24:11.610 align:middle line:84%
We're trying to pick ourselves
up out of whatever debris

00:24:11.610 --> 00:24:12.060 align:middle line:90%
and mud is left.

00:24:12.060 --> 00:24:13.227 align:middle line:90%
>>BYNUM: Something happened.

00:24:13.227 --> 00:24:14.130 align:middle line:90%
Something happened.

00:24:14.130 --> 00:24:15.600 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And I think
most people here

00:24:15.600 --> 00:24:18.142 align:middle line:84%
are comfortable with the notion
of an inundation, the Younger

00:24:18.142 --> 00:24:19.170 align:middle line:90%
Dryas period, all that.

00:24:19.170 --> 00:24:19.970 align:middle line:90%
>>BYNUM: Right.

00:24:19.970 --> 00:24:22.200 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: How did
we then move away

00:24:22.200 --> 00:24:27.420 align:middle line:84%
from the instinctive feminine
contribution into patriarchy?

00:24:27.420 --> 00:24:30.300 align:middle line:84%
>>BYNUM: The
patriarchy was a way--

00:24:30.300 --> 00:24:32.070 align:middle line:84%
and by the way,
it was successful,

00:24:32.070 --> 00:24:33.430 align:middle line:90%
we have to admit it--

00:24:33.430 --> 00:24:38.070 align:middle line:84%
it was a way to
reorganize aggressively.

00:24:38.070 --> 00:24:40.800 align:middle line:84%
And for the first
time in human history,

00:24:40.800 --> 00:24:52.210 align:middle line:84%
the males rose up and began to
dominate nature and also women.

00:24:52.210 --> 00:24:58.240 align:middle line:84%
And that was seen as a
way to control the world.

00:24:58.240 --> 00:25:01.480 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: But on a
psychospiritual, evolutionary

00:25:01.480 --> 00:25:04.840 align:middle line:90%
level, why was that necessary?

00:25:04.840 --> 00:25:06.460 align:middle line:84%
Because everything
had been destroyed?

00:25:06.460 --> 00:25:09.415 align:middle line:84%
Someone had to step up
and roll their sleeves up?

00:25:09.415 --> 00:25:10.540 align:middle line:90%
>>BYNUM: We're speculating.

00:25:10.540 --> 00:25:12.475 align:middle line:90%
We don't really know.

00:25:12.475 --> 00:25:13.350 align:middle line:10%
We don't really know.

00:25:13.350 --> 00:25:20.920 align:middle line:10%
All we know is that those
great female religions,

00:25:20.920 --> 00:25:22.810 align:middle line:10%
they were suppressed.

00:25:22.810 --> 00:25:26.020 align:middle line:84%
They still survive in
some societies today,

00:25:26.020 --> 00:25:28.600 align:middle line:84%
but they were
largely suppressed.

00:25:28.600 --> 00:25:32.200 align:middle line:84%
And the patriarchal
took over and dominated.

00:25:32.200 --> 00:25:36.460 align:middle line:84%
And the goal was to
dominate nature, including

00:25:36.460 --> 00:25:38.965 align:middle line:90%
the nature of females.

00:25:38.965 --> 00:25:40.840 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Well, you said
a little moment ago,

00:25:40.840 --> 00:25:42.580 align:middle line:90%
but it was a success.

00:25:42.580 --> 00:25:44.440 align:middle line:84%
>>BYNUM: It was
successful in doing

00:25:44.440 --> 00:25:47.742 align:middle line:90%
what it was designed to do.

00:25:47.742 --> 00:25:49.700 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Doesn't mean
it was the best for all,

00:25:49.700 --> 00:25:50.912 align:middle line:90%
but it was successful.

00:25:50.912 --> 00:25:52.370 align:middle line:84%
And then one could
even extend that

00:25:52.370 --> 00:25:55.040 align:middle line:84%
into the age of modern
times, the age of technology

00:25:55.040 --> 00:25:59.240 align:middle line:84%
where you needed a lot of very
directed, singular thinking

00:25:59.240 --> 00:26:01.580 align:middle line:84%
to bring about certain kinds
of creation, inventions.

00:26:01.580 --> 00:26:04.580 align:middle line:84%
>>BYNUM: But now it's
become a catastrophe.

00:26:04.580 --> 00:26:05.970 align:middle line:90%
Now it's become a catastrophe.

00:26:05.970 --> 00:26:09.500 align:middle line:84%
Now we have polluted the
waters, polluted the oceans.

00:26:09.500 --> 00:26:13.850 align:middle line:84%
And the very source of life
itself has become contaminated,

00:26:13.850 --> 00:26:16.760 align:middle line:84%
and we're on the
verge of extinction.

00:26:16.760 --> 00:26:22.830 align:middle line:84%
In the past when there has
been a vast ecological change,

00:26:22.830 --> 00:26:26.420 align:middle line:90%
a new form of us has arisen.

00:26:26.420 --> 00:26:30.410 align:middle line:84%
That happened with
the early primates.

00:26:30.410 --> 00:26:36.740 align:middle line:84%
That happened with the rise
of the Australopithecines.

00:26:36.740 --> 00:26:39.770 align:middle line:84%
That happened with the
rise of the homogeneous.

00:26:39.770 --> 00:26:43.520 align:middle line:84%
And that happened with the
rise of variations in between.

00:26:43.520 --> 00:26:45.860 align:middle line:84%
And we are in a
unique time right now,

00:26:45.860 --> 00:26:52.410 align:middle line:84%
because we are experiencing
a global climate

00:26:52.410 --> 00:26:54.880 align:middle line:90%
near catastrophe.

00:26:54.880 --> 00:26:57.130 align:middle line:84%
And interestingly enough,
for the first time

00:26:57.130 --> 00:26:58.870 align:middle line:84%
in the history of
our species, we're

00:26:58.870 --> 00:27:01.060 align:middle line:90%
about to leave the planet.

00:27:01.060 --> 00:27:01.860 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:27:01.860 --> 00:27:02.250 align:middle line:90%
Right.

00:27:02.250 --> 00:27:02.490 align:middle line:90%
That's right.

00:27:02.490 --> 00:27:03.570 align:middle line:90%
>>BYNUM: We are.

00:27:03.570 --> 00:27:05.340 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: People are going
up for weekends or whatever.

00:27:05.340 --> 00:27:05.910 align:middle line:90%
>>BYNUM: Yeah.

00:27:05.910 --> 00:27:07.243 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: If you have the money.

00:27:07.243 --> 00:27:10.140 align:middle line:84%
>>BYNUM: Well, the purely
military exploration of space

00:27:10.140 --> 00:27:13.660 align:middle line:84%
is beginning to take a backseat
to the commercial exploration

00:27:13.660 --> 00:27:14.460 align:middle line:90%
of space.

00:27:14.460 --> 00:27:18.540 align:middle line:84%
So we better have our act
together before we go out

00:27:18.540 --> 00:27:20.935 align:middle line:84%
into space, because god knows
what we'll find out there.

00:27:20.935 --> 00:27:23.310 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: I would not be
looking at that as a backup plan

00:27:23.310 --> 00:27:25.650 align:middle line:84%
for thinking we can get
away with destruction here

00:27:25.650 --> 00:27:27.442 align:middle line:84%
because there's something
better elsewhere.

00:27:27.442 --> 00:27:28.530 align:middle line:90%
>>BYNUM: No, not better.

00:27:28.530 --> 00:27:30.480 align:middle line:84%
I'm not talking about
going to another planet.

00:27:30.480 --> 00:27:33.930 align:middle line:84%
I'm talking about encountering
other forms of life.

00:27:33.930 --> 00:27:35.100 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Oh, yes, indeed.

00:27:35.100 --> 00:27:37.980 align:middle line:84%
>>BYNUM: And we
better figure out--

00:27:37.980 --> 00:27:38.940 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: What we are.

00:27:38.940 --> 00:27:40.110 align:middle line:90%
>>BYNUM: --what we are.

00:27:40.110 --> 00:27:43.470 align:middle line:84%
And I find it a very
soothing and comforting idea

00:27:43.470 --> 00:27:47.220 align:middle line:84%
for a species like us
who is at war with itself

00:27:47.220 --> 00:27:54.330 align:middle line:84%
that we all have a common
genetic, biological,

00:27:54.330 --> 00:27:59.160 align:middle line:84%
archaeological, and
paleontological origin.

00:27:59.160 --> 00:28:06.750 align:middle line:84%
And that is a warm, inclusive,
and actually very helpful

00:28:06.750 --> 00:28:10.080 align:middle line:84%
idea, because it also
points out and confirms

00:28:10.080 --> 00:28:12.390 align:middle line:84%
what all of our great
spiritual traditions say,

00:28:12.390 --> 00:28:14.280 align:middle line:90%
that we are all the same family.

00:28:14.280 --> 00:28:15.210 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:28:15.210 --> 00:28:17.070 align:middle line:84%
>>BYNUM: We are all
the same family.

00:28:17.070 --> 00:28:26.030 align:middle line:84%
And this is how science
and our great spiritual,

00:28:26.030 --> 00:28:29.360 align:middle line:84%
mystical traditions in
particular are pointing out.

00:28:29.360 --> 00:28:31.400 align:middle line:90%
And so they're coming together.

00:28:31.400 --> 00:28:34.045 align:middle line:84%
And it's an exciting
time to be alive.

00:28:34.045 --> 00:28:35.670 align:middle line:84%
And we're going to
make it, by the way.

00:28:35.670 --> 00:28:36.420 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: We are
going to make it.

00:28:36.420 --> 00:28:37.670 align:middle line:90%
I'm with you.

00:28:37.670 --> 00:28:38.670 align:middle line:90%
We are going to make it.

00:28:38.670 --> 00:28:41.590 align:middle line:90%
And so thank you.

00:28:41.590 --> 00:28:42.650 align:middle line:90%
We are one.

00:28:42.650 --> 00:28:44.100 align:middle line:90%
We are a species.

00:28:44.100 --> 00:28:45.120 align:middle line:90%
We are going to make it.

00:28:45.120 --> 00:28:47.383 align:middle line:84%
So within that, we
can go ahead and take

00:28:47.383 --> 00:28:49.550 align:middle line:84%
on some of the more challenging
stuff facing us now.

00:28:49.550 --> 00:28:51.740 align:middle line:84%
But first let's
take a quick stop.

00:28:51.740 --> 00:28:54.530 align:middle line:84%
You say that-- so
you have the Nubian

00:28:54.530 --> 00:28:56.630 align:middle line:84%
and Indigenous
Egyptians came together.

00:28:56.630 --> 00:28:58.400 align:middle line:84%
They started the
dynastic cultures

00:28:58.400 --> 00:29:02.340 align:middle line:84%
which also brought through it
deep spiritual understanding

00:29:02.340 --> 00:29:05.290 align:middle line:84%
and knowledge of the nature
of reality, cosmos, et cetera.

00:29:05.290 --> 00:29:07.040 align:middle line:84%
>>BYNUM: Including the
nature of the mind.

00:29:07.040 --> 00:29:07.880 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And the
nature of the mind.

00:29:07.880 --> 00:29:10.670 align:middle line:84%
>>BYNUM: The ancient Egyptians
knew about the unconscious

00:29:10.670 --> 00:29:12.830 align:middle line:90%
mind, and they call it by name--

00:29:12.830 --> 00:29:19.190 align:middle line:84%
the primeval waters of Nun, out
of which the world manifested

00:29:19.190 --> 00:29:21.192 align:middle line:90%
itself out of the unseen.

00:29:21.192 --> 00:29:23.150 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Well, this gets
into a lot of Cyrene.

00:29:23.150 --> 00:29:24.860 align:middle line:90%
>>BYNUM: Yes, yes.

00:29:24.860 --> 00:29:26.030 align:middle line:90%
There it is.

00:29:26.030 --> 00:29:28.060 align:middle line:90%
There it is.

00:29:28.060 --> 00:29:32.360 align:middle line:84%
And the idea, the notion of
the seven stages of the soul.

00:29:32.360 --> 00:29:37.880 align:middle line:84%
And that this is the origin
of the seven lively arts,

00:29:37.880 --> 00:29:38.690 align:middle line:90%
you know?

00:29:38.690 --> 00:29:40.790 align:middle line:84%
But these were the
mystery schools.

00:29:40.790 --> 00:29:43.670 align:middle line:84%
And the point was to
elevate human consciousness

00:29:43.670 --> 00:29:46.670 align:middle line:84%
to a supraluminous
consciousness.

00:29:46.670 --> 00:29:47.690 align:middle line:90%
That was the goal.

00:29:47.690 --> 00:29:48.350 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: That was the goal.

00:29:48.350 --> 00:29:49.440 align:middle line:90%
It didn't work out too well.

00:29:49.440 --> 00:29:50.750 align:middle line:84%
>>BYNUM: It didn't
work out too well

00:29:50.750 --> 00:29:51.950 align:middle line:90%
for huge numbers of people.

00:29:51.950 --> 00:29:52.750 align:middle line:90%
But you know what?

00:29:52.750 --> 00:29:55.400 align:middle line:84%
It did work out for
a lot of people,

00:29:55.400 --> 00:29:58.460 align:middle line:84%
because they kept alive
the mysteries even

00:29:58.460 --> 00:30:00.442 align:middle line:84%
after the fall of those
great civilizations.

00:30:00.442 --> 00:30:01.400 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: They're back.

00:30:01.400 --> 00:30:02.240 align:middle line:90%
You're back.

00:30:02.240 --> 00:30:03.120 align:middle line:90%
We're all back.

00:30:03.120 --> 00:30:03.980 align:middle line:90%
>>BYNUM: We're back.

00:30:03.980 --> 00:30:04.855 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: We're back.

00:30:04.855 --> 00:30:07.190 align:middle line:84%
It's time now where people
can embrace and understand.

00:30:07.190 --> 00:30:10.640 align:middle line:84%
We have the luxury in the sense
of being able to open ourselves

00:30:10.640 --> 00:30:13.470 align:middle line:84%
to thoughts beyond our survival
to where we can now take this

00:30:13.470 --> 00:30:14.270 align:middle line:90%
on.

00:30:14.270 --> 00:30:17.480 align:middle line:84%
Let's move forward, because
it's on everybody's minds,

00:30:17.480 --> 00:30:20.510 align:middle line:84%
everybody's hearts, and that
is the notion of colonialism.

00:30:20.510 --> 00:30:22.310 align:middle line:84%
And you and I were
talking off camera,

00:30:22.310 --> 00:30:25.520 align:middle line:84%
and we were talking about
colonialism, slavery, and such

00:30:25.520 --> 00:30:29.840 align:middle line:84%
where the Africans were enslaved
starting 500 years ago or so.

00:30:29.840 --> 00:30:31.070 align:middle line:90%
But you said something.

00:30:31.070 --> 00:30:32.810 align:middle line:90%
You said, but hold on a minute.

00:30:32.810 --> 00:30:33.722 align:middle line:90%
It goes both ways.

00:30:33.722 --> 00:30:35.180 align:middle line:84%
>>BYNUM: Yes, it
does go both ways.

00:30:35.180 --> 00:30:38.270 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So let's talk about
the African colonization

00:30:38.270 --> 00:30:39.090 align:middle line:90%
of Europe prior.

00:30:39.090 --> 00:30:39.890 align:middle line:90%
>>BYNUM: Yes.

00:30:39.890 --> 00:30:40.955 align:middle line:90%
People don't like to--

00:30:40.955 --> 00:30:42.830 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: They don't
want to hear about that.

00:30:42.830 --> 00:30:45.740 align:middle line:84%
>>BYNUM: --know
about that, but yes.

00:30:45.740 --> 00:30:48.350 align:middle line:90%


00:30:48.350 --> 00:30:51.110 align:middle line:84%
Thousands of years-- hundreds
of years before Christ,

00:30:51.110 --> 00:30:55.580 align:middle line:84%
there were African incursions
through Kemetic Egypt

00:30:55.580 --> 00:30:59.310 align:middle line:84%
and to the Middle East
and parts of Europe.

00:30:59.310 --> 00:31:04.100 align:middle line:84%
And there were African
armies, African civilizations

00:31:04.100 --> 00:31:06.327 align:middle line:84%
that moved into the Iberian
Peninsula for hundreds--

00:31:06.327 --> 00:31:07.160 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: The Moors.

00:31:07.160 --> 00:31:07.960 align:middle line:90%
>>BYNUM: The Moors.

00:31:07.960 --> 00:31:09.890 align:middle line:90%
And that was in 700 AD.

00:31:09.890 --> 00:31:14.570 align:middle line:84%
I'm talking about hundreds of
years BC, that was the case.

00:31:14.570 --> 00:31:18.050 align:middle line:84%
And they lived, they
existed for a while,

00:31:18.050 --> 00:31:22.340 align:middle line:84%
and then they ended, as
all civilizations do.

00:31:22.340 --> 00:31:25.400 align:middle line:84%
But yes, so that
has gone both ways.

00:31:25.400 --> 00:31:28.280 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: If we had the
potential to exploit,

00:31:28.280 --> 00:31:29.240 align:middle line:90%
we would exploit.

00:31:29.240 --> 00:31:32.150 align:middle line:84%
>>BYNUM: Well, that's the darker
side of our nature, apparently.

00:31:32.150 --> 00:31:36.590 align:middle line:84%
And then the most recent
one began at the end

00:31:36.590 --> 00:31:40.400 align:middle line:90%
of the voyages of Columbus.

00:31:40.400 --> 00:31:43.130 align:middle line:90%
That year, 1492, was a big year.

00:31:43.130 --> 00:31:45.170 align:middle line:84%
Columbus got lost
in the Americas.

00:31:45.170 --> 00:31:50.550 align:middle line:84%
The last African emperor, West
African emperor Sunni Ali dies.

00:31:50.550 --> 00:31:51.350 align:middle line:90%
And the more--

00:31:51.350 --> 00:31:53.760 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: I don't know about
the significance of that.

00:31:53.760 --> 00:31:55.970 align:middle line:90%
>>BYNUM: Well, he was the last--

00:31:55.970 --> 00:32:01.343 align:middle line:84%
West Africa in particular had
had a series of great empires.

00:32:01.343 --> 00:32:03.010 align:middle line:84%
We don't talk about
that much in school.

00:32:03.010 --> 00:32:03.230 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: No.

00:32:03.230 --> 00:32:04.030 align:middle line:90%
No, not at all.

00:32:04.030 --> 00:32:06.140 align:middle line:84%
>>BYNUM: But they had a
series of great empires.

00:32:06.140 --> 00:32:09.320 align:middle line:90%
Songhai, Ghana, Mali.

00:32:09.320 --> 00:32:11.510 align:middle line:84%
They came and went and
succeeded each other,

00:32:11.510 --> 00:32:13.760 align:middle line:84%
but they were empires
for hundreds of years.

00:32:13.760 --> 00:32:19.130 align:middle line:84%
And then when they
fell beginning in 1492,

00:32:19.130 --> 00:32:21.080 align:middle line:90%
the last great emperor dies--

00:32:21.080 --> 00:32:23.790 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Just as Columbus
stumbles into the land mass

00:32:23.790 --> 00:32:24.590 align:middle line:90%
here.

00:32:24.590 --> 00:32:27.890 align:middle line:84%
>>BYNUM: And the Jews
are kicked out of Spain.

00:32:27.890 --> 00:32:29.780 align:middle line:90%
1492, big year.

00:32:29.780 --> 00:32:32.810 align:middle line:84%
That's when the slave
trade in the West begins.

00:32:32.810 --> 00:32:38.330 align:middle line:84%
And it wasn't so much that
Europe and huge armies

00:32:38.330 --> 00:32:39.900 align:middle line:90%
invaded West Africa.

00:32:39.900 --> 00:32:40.700 align:middle line:90%
No.

00:32:40.700 --> 00:32:42.810 align:middle line:90%
West Africa was in decline.

00:32:42.810 --> 00:32:43.610 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: OK.

00:32:43.610 --> 00:32:45.965 align:middle line:84%
So it had had its turn,
and now it was in decline.

00:32:45.965 --> 00:32:47.090 align:middle line:90%
>>BYNUM: It was in decline.

00:32:47.090 --> 00:32:47.330 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: OK.

00:32:47.330 --> 00:32:48.455 align:middle line:90%
>>BYNUM: Now it has--

00:32:48.455 --> 00:32:50.810 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: It's resulted
in the use of people.

00:32:50.810 --> 00:32:51.680 align:middle line:90%
>>BYNUM: Yes.

00:32:51.680 --> 00:32:55.940 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So now you introduce
slavery into Europe, also

00:32:55.940 --> 00:32:56.780 align:middle line:90%
into the Americas.

00:32:56.780 --> 00:32:57.050 align:middle line:90%
>>BYNUM: Yes.

00:32:57.050 --> 00:32:57.850 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: OK.

00:32:57.850 --> 00:33:02.000 align:middle line:84%
So you are forcibly
taking human beings

00:33:02.000 --> 00:33:04.520 align:middle line:84%
and moving them
against their will

00:33:04.520 --> 00:33:07.520 align:middle line:84%
to perform tasks for
other human beings, which

00:33:07.520 --> 00:33:10.550 align:middle line:84%
every person understands
how appalling that

00:33:10.550 --> 00:33:11.840 align:middle line:90%
is at every level.

00:33:11.840 --> 00:33:14.330 align:middle line:84%
Nonetheless, it
set up a cycle here

00:33:14.330 --> 00:33:18.050 align:middle line:84%
that is now coming home to
roost in extraordinary ways.

00:33:18.050 --> 00:33:19.520 align:middle line:90%
So let's talk about that.

00:33:19.520 --> 00:33:20.390 align:middle line:90%
What happened?

00:33:20.390 --> 00:33:22.190 align:middle line:90%
So we're moving--

00:33:22.190 --> 00:33:23.650 align:middle line:90%
West Africa is in decline.

00:33:23.650 --> 00:33:26.720 align:middle line:84%
Those cultures have
started declining.

00:33:26.720 --> 00:33:28.250 align:middle line:90%
People are selling people.

00:33:28.250 --> 00:33:30.660 align:middle line:84%
People are selling their
own people to other people.

00:33:30.660 --> 00:33:32.450 align:middle line:90%
>>BYNUM: Right.

00:33:32.450 --> 00:33:36.410 align:middle line:84%
The notion of slavery in West
Africa among the Africans

00:33:36.410 --> 00:33:38.660 align:middle line:84%
did not have the
same connotation

00:33:38.660 --> 00:33:39.742 align:middle line:90%
that it did in Europe.

00:33:39.742 --> 00:33:40.950 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Tell us about that.

00:33:40.950 --> 00:33:43.580 align:middle line:84%
>>BYNUM: Well, in Africa
you could be a slave,

00:33:43.580 --> 00:33:46.040 align:middle line:84%
but that was oftentimes you
were rented out to somebody

00:33:46.040 --> 00:33:46.880 align:middle line:90%
for a while.

00:33:46.880 --> 00:33:48.630 align:middle line:84%
And then after a
certain period of time,

00:33:48.630 --> 00:33:51.530 align:middle line:84%
like an indentured servant,
you got your freedom back.

00:33:51.530 --> 00:33:53.240 align:middle line:90%
In fact, that sounds--

00:33:53.240 --> 00:33:58.310 align:middle line:84%
enslavement began here in the
United States in particular.

00:33:58.310 --> 00:34:01.370 align:middle line:90%
Africans were enslaved.

00:34:01.370 --> 00:34:03.660 align:middle line:84%
Other Europeans were
enslaved by other Europeans.

00:34:03.660 --> 00:34:04.460 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: True.

00:34:04.460 --> 00:34:05.750 align:middle line:90%
>>BYNUM: Yeah.

00:34:05.750 --> 00:34:10.250 align:middle line:84%
Usually for seven years
as an indentured servant.

00:34:10.250 --> 00:34:12.320 align:middle line:84%
After a while, however,
only the African

00:34:12.320 --> 00:34:15.560 align:middle line:84%
was an indentured
servant for life.

00:34:15.560 --> 00:34:18.800 align:middle line:84%
And that went on during what's
called the antebellum period,

00:34:18.800 --> 00:34:23.210 align:middle line:84%
and that's when we developed
a lot of our models

00:34:23.210 --> 00:34:26.360 align:middle line:84%
and stereotypes and
interactions that we

00:34:26.360 --> 00:34:28.370 align:middle line:90%
have with each other today.

00:34:28.370 --> 00:34:33.800 align:middle line:84%
And sometimes they were very
close and very, very violent,

00:34:33.800 --> 00:34:38.810 align:middle line:84%
and sometimes they were
almost comically intimate.

00:34:38.810 --> 00:34:39.650 align:middle line:90%
There's a--

00:34:39.650 --> 00:34:41.389 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: The interdependence
on each other.

00:34:41.389 --> 00:34:43.181 align:middle line:84%
>>BYNUM: The interdependence
on each other.

00:34:43.181 --> 00:34:47.239 align:middle line:84%
In the antebellum South,
oftentimes Africans

00:34:47.239 --> 00:34:51.080 align:middle line:84%
were in very intimate
circumstances,

00:34:51.080 --> 00:34:54.350 align:middle line:84%
family circumstances
with their white masters,

00:34:54.350 --> 00:34:57.470 align:middle line:84%
particularly around
nurturance and food issues.

00:34:57.470 --> 00:34:59.900 align:middle line:84%
I mean, how many times
can you walk into a store

00:34:59.900 --> 00:35:03.470 align:middle line:84%
today and pick up on the grocery
store package of something

00:35:03.470 --> 00:35:09.110 align:middle line:84%
by Aunt Jemima or
Buckwheat or Farina.

00:35:09.110 --> 00:35:10.070 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:35:10.070 --> 00:35:11.180 align:middle line:90%
It became nurturance.

00:35:11.180 --> 00:35:14.190 align:middle line:84%
>>BYNUM: This became associated
with nurturance on one hand,

00:35:14.190 --> 00:35:16.650 align:middle line:84%
but you also had the
violence on the other.

00:35:16.650 --> 00:35:19.570 align:middle line:84%
So they were very close, and
that still continues today.

00:35:19.570 --> 00:35:22.070 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: It's funny you should
say that, because I was so--

00:35:22.070 --> 00:35:24.000 align:middle line:84%
the skunk at the
picnic when I said,

00:35:24.000 --> 00:35:25.715 align:middle line:84%
I'm so bummed Aunt
Jemima's leaving.

00:35:25.715 --> 00:35:28.760 align:middle line:84%
[LAUGHS] I love Aunt
Jemima, because to me

00:35:28.760 --> 00:35:33.050 align:middle line:84%
it meant nurturing and
love and sweetness of life.

00:35:33.050 --> 00:35:35.810 align:middle line:84%
And so it's totally
politically incorrect now,

00:35:35.810 --> 00:35:38.510 align:middle line:84%
but it was one of those little
moments of letting something

00:35:38.510 --> 00:35:42.770 align:middle line:84%
pass away on a sentimental level
that's not correct anymore.

00:35:42.770 --> 00:35:44.196 align:middle line:90%
>>BYNUM: Right.

00:35:44.196 --> 00:35:46.700 align:middle line:84%
It's not necessarily
politically correct,

00:35:46.700 --> 00:35:51.320 align:middle line:84%
but I want to emphasize
psychologically how intimate--

00:35:51.320 --> 00:35:53.300 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Yes, I see
what you're saying.

00:35:53.300 --> 00:35:56.325 align:middle line:90%
Absolutely.

00:35:56.325 --> 00:35:59.540 align:middle line:84%
>>BYNUM: And today,
that goes on.

00:35:59.540 --> 00:36:02.720 align:middle line:84%
Things are obviously radically
improved, I believe so.

00:36:02.720 --> 00:36:03.820 align:middle line:90%
Radically improved.

00:36:03.820 --> 00:36:11.040 align:middle line:84%
But we still have periods
where the white population

00:36:11.040 --> 00:36:14.540 align:middle line:84%
in the United States becomes
exceedingly fearful--

00:36:14.540 --> 00:36:17.220 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Oh, we're going
to get to that in a minute.

00:36:17.220 --> 00:36:18.650 align:middle line:90%
>>BYNUM: --of African Americans.

00:36:18.650 --> 00:36:19.670 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Well, yes.

00:36:19.670 --> 00:36:21.560 align:middle line:90%
And probably for good reason.

00:36:21.560 --> 00:36:22.530 align:middle line:90%
They created it.

00:36:22.530 --> 00:36:23.780 align:middle line:90%
So let's go back a little bit.

00:36:23.780 --> 00:36:25.850 align:middle line:84%
Go back into that
era, antebellum.

00:36:25.850 --> 00:36:29.090 align:middle line:84%
Here you have white men
being raised by Black women.

00:36:29.090 --> 00:36:30.160 align:middle line:90%
>>BYNUM: As wet nurses.

00:36:30.160 --> 00:36:31.160 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: As wet nurses.

00:36:31.160 --> 00:36:32.180 align:middle line:90%
I mean, yes.

00:36:32.180 --> 00:36:35.062 align:middle line:84%
Their milk, their nurturance,
their cooking, their care.

00:36:35.062 --> 00:36:36.770 align:middle line:84%
They're combing their
hair, bathing them.

00:36:36.770 --> 00:36:39.200 align:middle line:84%
White men being
raised by Black women.

00:36:39.200 --> 00:36:40.030 align:middle line:90%
>>BYNUM: Right.

00:36:40.030 --> 00:36:40.830 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: OK.

00:36:40.830 --> 00:36:42.413 align:middle line:84%
And then they're
going to have to come

00:36:42.413 --> 00:36:43.640 align:middle line:90%
into a position of ownership.

00:36:43.640 --> 00:36:44.557 align:middle line:90%
>>BYNUM: That's right.

00:36:44.557 --> 00:36:46.860 align:middle line:90%
And you have to reject that.

00:36:46.860 --> 00:36:47.855 align:middle line:90%
And sometimes you--

00:36:47.855 --> 00:36:48.980 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: That's messed up.

00:36:48.980 --> 00:36:50.540 align:middle line:84%
I mean, that's
cognitive dissonance.

00:36:50.540 --> 00:36:51.915 align:middle line:84%
>>BYNUM: That's
deeply messed up.

00:36:51.915 --> 00:36:56.810 align:middle line:84%
In fact, many times
slaves, enslaved people,

00:36:56.810 --> 00:36:59.960 align:middle line:84%
their fathers were
the plantation owners.

00:36:59.960 --> 00:37:01.790 align:middle line:84%
And so sometimes these
plantation owners

00:37:01.790 --> 00:37:03.560 align:middle line:90%
sold off their own children.

00:37:03.560 --> 00:37:05.210 align:middle line:90%
Think about that.

00:37:05.210 --> 00:37:06.920 align:middle line:84%
Think about what
kind of head trip

00:37:06.920 --> 00:37:11.840 align:middle line:84%
you have to be in to sell
off your daughter or son.

00:37:11.840 --> 00:37:13.910 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: I mean,
that's very deep,

00:37:13.910 --> 00:37:16.520 align:middle line:84%
as I said a moment ago,
cognitive dissonance,

00:37:16.520 --> 00:37:18.920 align:middle line:90%
emotional dissonance.

00:37:18.920 --> 00:37:22.790 align:middle line:84%
The very thing that gave you
an upbringing and nurturing

00:37:22.790 --> 00:37:24.800 align:middle line:84%
that you have to then
reject or you have to own,

00:37:24.800 --> 00:37:25.890 align:middle line:90%
you have to dominate.

00:37:25.890 --> 00:37:26.690 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:37:26.690 --> 00:37:28.350 align:middle line:90%
So this has gone on for a while.

00:37:28.350 --> 00:37:30.540 align:middle line:90%
So then slavery was ended.

00:37:30.540 --> 00:37:34.220 align:middle line:84%
But if you go to a lot of
places in the South today,

00:37:34.220 --> 00:37:38.980 align:middle line:84%
even in Georgia, for example,
it's like slavery ended,

00:37:38.980 --> 00:37:40.850 align:middle line:90%
but the mentality didn't end.

00:37:40.850 --> 00:37:41.650 align:middle line:90%
>>BYNUM: Right.

00:37:41.650 --> 00:37:43.570 align:middle line:90%
The mentality isn't there.

00:37:43.570 --> 00:37:50.390 align:middle line:84%
And for complex reasons, much
of these mentalities there,

00:37:50.390 --> 00:37:52.180 align:middle line:90%
many of the patterns are there.

00:37:52.180 --> 00:37:55.150 align:middle line:84%
And I would argue-- and this
is not a popular position--

00:37:55.150 --> 00:38:00.090 align:middle line:84%
but I would argue
that there has been--

00:38:00.090 --> 00:38:02.520 align:middle line:90%
well, put it this way.

00:38:02.520 --> 00:38:08.740 align:middle line:84%
Racism has served a very
useful function in America.

00:38:08.740 --> 00:38:09.540 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Tell us--

00:38:09.540 --> 00:38:13.500 align:middle line:84%
>>BYNUM: Well,
when Europeans came

00:38:13.500 --> 00:38:17.460 align:middle line:84%
to the Americas and the United
States, they weren't white.

00:38:17.460 --> 00:38:21.460 align:middle line:90%
They were French, Italian--

00:38:21.460 --> 00:38:23.130 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: German, Irish.

00:38:23.130 --> 00:38:25.300 align:middle line:84%
>>BYNUM: Irish, Swedish,
so on and so forth.

00:38:25.300 --> 00:38:28.590 align:middle line:90%
And they were different tribes.

00:38:28.590 --> 00:38:33.460 align:middle line:84%
And the only way that they could
be united was to become white.

00:38:33.460 --> 00:38:34.260 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Oh.

00:38:34.260 --> 00:38:36.690 align:middle line:84%
So they had a common enemy,
someone with darker skin.

00:38:36.690 --> 00:38:37.800 align:middle line:90%
>>BYNUM: Yes.

00:38:37.800 --> 00:38:41.588 align:middle line:84%
And that is how
racism helped unite--

00:38:41.588 --> 00:38:44.130 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: I mean, practically
speaking, what you say is true.

00:38:44.130 --> 00:38:45.750 align:middle line:90%
>>BYNUM: Yes.

00:38:45.750 --> 00:38:51.090 align:middle line:90%
And now it is rancid.

00:38:51.090 --> 00:38:54.000 align:middle line:84%
And it was rancid
then and violent then,

00:38:54.000 --> 00:38:57.580 align:middle line:84%
but now it is
economically, politically,

00:38:57.580 --> 00:39:01.680 align:middle line:84%
and otherwise extremely
taxing, and it

00:39:01.680 --> 00:39:03.390 align:middle line:90%
drains our spiritual resources.

00:39:03.390 --> 00:39:09.540 align:middle line:84%
And we cannot hold ourselves
up as the moral leaders

00:39:09.540 --> 00:39:13.752 align:middle line:84%
of the world, because
people know what we did.

00:39:13.752 --> 00:39:15.210 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Yes, and
people remember.

00:39:15.210 --> 00:39:18.180 align:middle line:84%
Even if you look at it from
a reincarnation standpoint,

00:39:18.180 --> 00:39:19.020 align:middle line:90%
people come back.

00:39:19.020 --> 00:39:19.830 align:middle line:90%
You remember stuff.

00:39:19.830 --> 00:39:20.630 align:middle line:90%
It's in your aura.

00:39:20.630 --> 00:39:21.730 align:middle line:90%
You have feelings.

00:39:21.730 --> 00:39:26.190 align:middle line:84%
So for example, what if you were
one of these plantation owners

00:39:26.190 --> 00:39:29.250 align:middle line:84%
who had an uprising, because
they pushed everyone too far

00:39:29.250 --> 00:39:31.200 align:middle line:84%
and they'd had-- the
people had had enough?

00:39:31.200 --> 00:39:32.580 align:middle line:90%
That doesn't get reported a lot.

00:39:32.580 --> 00:39:33.790 align:middle line:90%
Talk about this for a moment.

00:39:33.790 --> 00:39:35.165 align:middle line:84%
We've only got a
few minutes left

00:39:35.165 --> 00:39:38.100 align:middle line:84%
to get to where we are today
and what needs to happen,

00:39:38.100 --> 00:39:39.930 align:middle line:84%
because you call it
something brilliant.

00:39:39.930 --> 00:39:41.180 align:middle line:90%
We'll reveal that in a moment.

00:39:41.180 --> 00:39:43.650 align:middle line:84%
>>BYNUM: Well, there
were hundreds--

00:39:43.650 --> 00:39:46.960 align:middle line:84%
there were literally hundreds
of slave uprisings in the United

00:39:46.960 --> 00:39:50.190 align:middle line:84%
States, particularly in
the antebellum South.

00:39:50.190 --> 00:39:53.070 align:middle line:84%
And so living on the
plantation if you were white

00:39:53.070 --> 00:39:55.410 align:middle line:90%
was a very precarious situation.

00:39:55.410 --> 00:39:57.840 align:middle line:84%
And you had to be on
top of that situation,

00:39:57.840 --> 00:40:01.540 align:middle line:84%
and you have to have an overseer
who was doing what his job--

00:40:01.540 --> 00:40:02.460 align:middle line:90%
it was always a him--

00:40:02.460 --> 00:40:07.680 align:middle line:84%
doing his job to make sure
that the Blacks didn't rise up,

00:40:07.680 --> 00:40:09.300 align:middle line:84%
because it could
happen like this.

00:40:09.300 --> 00:40:10.300 align:middle line:90%
There are hundreds--

00:40:10.300 --> 00:40:12.550 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So they had to
be pretty brutal enforcers.

00:40:12.550 --> 00:40:13.350 align:middle line:90%
>>BYNUM: Yes.

00:40:13.350 --> 00:40:16.470 align:middle line:84%
Had to be pretty brutal,
because otherwise you

00:40:16.470 --> 00:40:20.250 align:middle line:84%
could be with your family, and
maybe the 10 of you were there,

00:40:20.250 --> 00:40:21.870 align:middle line:90%
and you'd have 50 slaves.

00:40:21.870 --> 00:40:24.360 align:middle line:84%
The slaves could rise up
and kill everybody off.

00:40:24.360 --> 00:40:26.010 align:middle line:90%
And that happened periodically.

00:40:26.010 --> 00:40:34.740 align:middle line:84%
So there was an uneasy truth
in that peculiar institution,

00:40:34.740 --> 00:40:37.350 align:middle line:84%
and everybody had
to know their roles.

00:40:37.350 --> 00:40:41.310 align:middle line:84%
And part of the consciousness
of the African Americans

00:40:41.310 --> 00:40:44.820 align:middle line:84%
was a dual consciousness
of the consciousness

00:40:44.820 --> 00:40:49.490 align:middle line:84%
of behaving and interacting
with the white owner

00:40:49.490 --> 00:40:53.032 align:middle line:90%
as an enslaved person and--

00:40:53.032 --> 00:40:53.990 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: For survival.

00:40:53.990 --> 00:40:55.032 align:middle line:90%
>>BYNUM: That's survival.

00:40:55.032 --> 00:40:59.840 align:middle line:84%
But also having another
consciousness that that slave

00:40:59.840 --> 00:41:01.430 align:middle line:90%
owner didn't see.

00:41:01.430 --> 00:41:02.570 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

00:41:02.570 --> 00:41:04.563 align:middle line:90%
In order to survive.

00:41:04.563 --> 00:41:05.480 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Interesting.

00:41:05.480 --> 00:41:06.650 align:middle line:90%
>>BYNUM: A dual consciousness.

00:41:06.650 --> 00:41:07.190 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

00:41:07.190 --> 00:41:08.300 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Well,
you would have to.

00:41:08.300 --> 00:41:09.100 align:middle line:90%
>>BYNUM: Yes.

00:41:09.100 --> 00:41:12.620 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So now we come
along into modern history,

00:41:12.620 --> 00:41:16.310 align:middle line:84%
and now depending on a
person's geographical location,

00:41:16.310 --> 00:41:18.480 align:middle line:84%
family background,
et cetera, people

00:41:18.480 --> 00:41:20.480 align:middle line:84%
can rise up and become
what they wish to become.

00:41:20.480 --> 00:41:21.740 align:middle line:90%
But it's not all equal.

00:41:21.740 --> 00:41:22.903 align:middle line:90%
Not even remotely equal.

00:41:22.903 --> 00:41:23.820 align:middle line:90%
>>BYNUM: It's not, no.

00:41:23.820 --> 00:41:25.880 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And so here we
have this inequity still.

00:41:25.880 --> 00:41:27.880 align:middle line:84%
We say, oh, we've got
Barack Obama as president.

00:41:27.880 --> 00:41:30.300 align:middle line:84%
We have you, Dr.
Bynum, and so forth.

00:41:30.300 --> 00:41:34.990 align:middle line:84%
But the reality
is it is a, to me,

00:41:34.990 --> 00:41:37.750 align:middle line:84%
criminally imbalanced
system still.

00:41:37.750 --> 00:41:43.555 align:middle line:84%
And so now we have what
you call the fear of the--

00:41:43.555 --> 00:41:45.140 align:middle line:84%
what is it called
about the repressed?

00:41:45.140 --> 00:41:45.940 align:middle line:90%
Say that--

00:41:45.940 --> 00:41:47.200 align:middle line:84%
>>BYNUM: Threatened
return of the repressed.

00:41:47.200 --> 00:41:49.120 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Threatened
return of the repressed.

00:41:49.120 --> 00:41:52.930 align:middle line:84%
That means the repressed
as in Blacks in America,

00:41:52.930 --> 00:41:54.968 align:middle line:90%
as in women in particular.

00:41:54.968 --> 00:41:56.260 align:middle line:90%
These two groups in particular.

00:41:56.260 --> 00:41:57.060 align:middle line:90%
>>BYNUM: Yes.

00:41:57.060 --> 00:41:59.230 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Let's talk about
that because everything

00:41:59.230 --> 00:42:03.130 align:middle line:84%
we're seeing, these horrible
situations-- racial shootings,

00:42:03.130 --> 00:42:07.270 align:middle line:84%
these things that are going
to trial now everywhere--

00:42:07.270 --> 00:42:11.150 align:middle line:84%
what's going on when you
talk about this return

00:42:11.150 --> 00:42:11.950 align:middle line:90%
of the repressed?

00:42:11.950 --> 00:42:16.420 align:middle line:84%
>>BYNUM: Those are almost
always situations in which white

00:42:16.420 --> 00:42:23.050 align:middle line:84%
people, either as a vigilante
or as a hired police officer,

00:42:23.050 --> 00:42:24.190 align:middle line:90%
their job--

00:42:24.190 --> 00:42:26.980 align:middle line:84%
they see themselves, it's their
job in many cases-- not always,

00:42:26.980 --> 00:42:27.880 align:middle line:90%
but many cases--

00:42:27.880 --> 00:42:30.070 align:middle line:84%
of controlling something
that doesn't get out

00:42:30.070 --> 00:42:33.018 align:middle line:84%
of control, because if it gets
out of control, god knows.

00:42:33.018 --> 00:42:34.810 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: That slave
owner mentality still.

00:42:34.810 --> 00:42:35.610 align:middle line:90%
>>BYNUM: Yeah.

00:42:35.610 --> 00:42:37.390 align:middle line:84%
God knows what could
happen, you know?

00:42:37.390 --> 00:42:44.500 align:middle line:84%
And curiously enough, it is a
similar situation with women,

00:42:44.500 --> 00:42:47.380 align:middle line:84%
keeping women under control
because if they get out

00:42:47.380 --> 00:42:50.740 align:middle line:84%
of control, you
don't know what could

00:42:50.740 --> 00:42:54.290 align:middle line:84%
happen to the economic order
and to your own family.

00:42:54.290 --> 00:42:55.480 align:middle line:90%
And so it is--

00:42:55.480 --> 00:42:58.450 align:middle line:84%
we have to redefine
the family as not

00:42:58.450 --> 00:43:02.620 align:middle line:84%
a patriarchal
phenomenon, but as a more

00:43:02.620 --> 00:43:04.030 align:middle line:90%
balanced kind of situation.

00:43:04.030 --> 00:43:07.690 align:middle line:84%
And we're still dynamically
trying to work that out.

00:43:07.690 --> 00:43:08.500 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: We are.

00:43:08.500 --> 00:43:09.280 align:middle line:84%
>>BYNUM: We are
trying to work it out.

00:43:09.280 --> 00:43:10.640 align:middle line:90%
And it's not easy.

00:43:10.640 --> 00:43:11.590 align:middle line:90%
It's not easy.

00:43:11.590 --> 00:43:14.800 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And the
racial divide, racism

00:43:14.800 --> 00:43:17.110 align:middle line:90%
is even less easy right now.

00:43:17.110 --> 00:43:22.375 align:middle line:84%
>>BYNUM: Racism is particularly
difficult, because not only do

00:43:22.375 --> 00:43:25.780 align:middle line:84%
we have our recent
experiences of the last half

00:43:25.780 --> 00:43:29.350 align:middle line:84%
century since Columbus and
the slave trade in the West,

00:43:29.350 --> 00:43:34.720 align:middle line:84%
but we also have a deeper
psychic repression of what

00:43:34.720 --> 00:43:36.730 align:middle line:90%
is African in ourselves.

00:43:36.730 --> 00:43:39.820 align:middle line:84%
The African origin of
human consciousness

00:43:39.820 --> 00:43:42.880 align:middle line:84%
is the fundamental consciousness
of the human being.

00:43:42.880 --> 00:43:45.820 align:middle line:84%
And in deep spiritual
states, people

00:43:45.820 --> 00:43:47.960 align:middle line:90%
can make contact with that.

00:43:47.960 --> 00:43:50.200 align:middle line:84%
And the deep river of
human consciousness

00:43:50.200 --> 00:43:52.540 align:middle line:84%
is an African
consciousness, and that

00:43:52.540 --> 00:43:56.680 align:middle line:84%
enters into the ocean
of human consciousness.

00:43:56.680 --> 00:44:00.670 align:middle line:84%
And that is the origin
of our spirituality.

00:44:00.670 --> 00:44:03.250 align:middle line:84%
That was why the
subtitle of the book

00:44:03.250 --> 00:44:08.080 align:middle line:84%
is "The Black Origins of
Mysticism and Psychology,"

00:44:08.080 --> 00:44:10.150 align:middle line:84%
psychology being
the science of it,

00:44:10.150 --> 00:44:14.920 align:middle line:84%
but mysticism being still the
mysterious part that begins

00:44:14.920 --> 00:44:16.270 align:middle line:90%
in the mother's womb.

00:44:16.270 --> 00:44:18.040 align:middle line:90%
It begins in the mother's womb.

00:44:18.040 --> 00:44:20.710 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Well, it even
comes into dream world.

00:44:20.710 --> 00:44:22.770 align:middle line:84%
This even plays out
in our consciousness.

00:44:22.770 --> 00:44:25.420 align:middle line:84%
It plays out in the
consciousness of white people

00:44:25.420 --> 00:44:27.820 align:middle line:84%
where we have dreams of
having been dark-skinned

00:44:27.820 --> 00:44:28.750 align:middle line:90%
in other lifetimes.

00:44:28.750 --> 00:44:30.130 align:middle line:90%
Carl Jung had such dreams.

00:44:30.130 --> 00:44:31.005 align:middle line:90%
>>BYNUM: Yes, he did.

00:44:31.005 --> 00:44:33.220 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So this
remembrance is within us,

00:44:33.220 --> 00:44:38.170 align:middle line:84%
but this recent history of
exploitation and perceived

00:44:38.170 --> 00:44:42.940 align:middle line:84%
desire for revenge,
how true is that?

00:44:42.940 --> 00:44:45.445 align:middle line:84%
I mean, if you're Black
and you're repressed,

00:44:45.445 --> 00:44:47.320 align:middle line:84%
you're stopped when you
shouldn't be stopped,

00:44:47.320 --> 00:44:51.490 align:middle line:84%
you're singled out all the time,
I cannot fathom the anger that

00:44:51.490 --> 00:44:53.450 align:middle line:84%
would build in me if I
were subjected to this.

00:44:53.450 --> 00:44:54.250 align:middle line:90%
>>BYNUM, Yes. yes.

00:44:54.250 --> 00:44:55.917 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And yet,
you have to stuff it,

00:44:55.917 --> 00:44:57.530 align:middle line:84%
just like in the
plantation days.

00:44:57.530 --> 00:45:04.000 align:middle line:84%
>>BYNUM: And control it, because
expressed the wrong way can

00:45:04.000 --> 00:45:05.200 align:middle line:90%
get you killed.

00:45:05.200 --> 00:45:07.575 align:middle line:84%
And relatively little happens
to the people who kill you.

00:45:07.575 --> 00:45:08.375 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Exactly.

00:45:08.375 --> 00:45:10.240 align:middle line:84%
>>BYNUM: And that
is still the case.

00:45:10.240 --> 00:45:11.300 align:middle line:90%
It is still the case.

00:45:11.300 --> 00:45:13.720 align:middle line:84%
And I know many people
in the United States

00:45:13.720 --> 00:45:16.030 align:middle line:84%
don't want to acknowledge
and believe that,

00:45:16.030 --> 00:45:18.940 align:middle line:84%
because they want to keep seeing
these as isolated incidents.

00:45:18.940 --> 00:45:20.860 align:middle line:90%
But this is a pattern.

00:45:20.860 --> 00:45:22.995 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: This is a deep
pattern in this country.

00:45:22.995 --> 00:45:25.120 align:middle line:84%
>>BYNUM: Most white Americans
have a difficult time

00:45:25.120 --> 00:45:31.090 align:middle line:84%
understanding that, because it
takes a great deal of empathy

00:45:31.090 --> 00:45:34.030 align:middle line:84%
to make contact with that
which you are afraid of, which

00:45:34.030 --> 00:45:36.580 align:middle line:84%
you love but afraid of,
love but were afraid of.

00:45:36.580 --> 00:45:38.608 align:middle line:90%
You know?

00:45:38.608 --> 00:45:43.390 align:middle line:84%
And so the capacity for
empathic connection with that

00:45:43.390 --> 00:45:45.490 align:middle line:90%
is sometimes limited.

00:45:45.490 --> 00:45:50.860 align:middle line:84%
What is similar, it's
similar to men understanding

00:45:50.860 --> 00:45:54.910 align:middle line:84%
that for a woman to be in
a strange place at night,

00:45:54.910 --> 00:45:58.500 align:middle line:84%
walking the streets
is dangerous for her.

00:45:58.500 --> 00:46:00.677 align:middle line:84%
Most men can do that
and they don't think--

00:46:00.677 --> 00:46:02.760 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Don't think--
but they won't extend that

00:46:02.760 --> 00:46:03.500 align:middle line:90%
to another race.

00:46:03.500 --> 00:46:04.950 align:middle line:84%
>>BYNUM: I'm not going
to be sexually attacked.

00:46:04.950 --> 00:46:07.470 align:middle line:84%
What does that got to do with--
but women understand that.

00:46:07.470 --> 00:46:08.280 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Women understand it.

00:46:08.280 --> 00:46:08.520 align:middle line:90%
Yep.

00:46:08.520 --> 00:46:09.320 align:middle line:90%
>>BYNUM: Yes.

00:46:09.320 --> 00:46:11.820 align:middle line:84%
Well, it's the same thing for
Blacks and African Americans.

00:46:11.820 --> 00:46:12.870 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: And even worse.

00:46:12.870 --> 00:46:13.670 align:middle line:90%
>>BYNUM: Yes.

00:46:13.670 --> 00:46:16.050 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And so let me
ask you this as we wrap up,

00:46:16.050 --> 00:46:20.340 align:middle line:84%
because we could talk
for hours, obviously.

00:46:20.340 --> 00:46:23.820 align:middle line:84%
What would you say-- if you
could take a synthesis of what

00:46:23.820 --> 00:46:28.440 align:middle line:84%
you feel the Black
emotional status is

00:46:28.440 --> 00:46:31.080 align:middle line:84%
in America at this
time, what would

00:46:31.080 --> 00:46:35.550 align:middle line:84%
you say would have to happen
to create the great healing?

00:46:35.550 --> 00:46:41.040 align:middle line:84%
>>BYNUM: Well, as odd as it may
seem, as odd as it may seem,

00:46:41.040 --> 00:46:43.950 align:middle line:84%
African Americans
in the United States

00:46:43.950 --> 00:46:47.740 align:middle line:84%
are more hopeful about America
than most white people are.

00:46:47.740 --> 00:46:48.540 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Really?

00:46:48.540 --> 00:46:49.410 align:middle line:90%
>>BYNUM: Yes, they are.

00:46:49.410 --> 00:46:50.100 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Share more.

00:46:50.100 --> 00:46:50.900 align:middle line:90%
I love this.

00:46:50.900 --> 00:46:55.020 align:middle line:84%
>>BYNUM: Because Black
people, African-Americans,

00:46:55.020 --> 00:46:59.820 align:middle line:84%
have a memory of how
really bad it had been.

00:46:59.820 --> 00:47:01.230 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Atrocious.

00:47:01.230 --> 00:47:03.460 align:middle line:84%
>>BYNUM: And where we are
today, which is not great,

00:47:03.460 --> 00:47:06.260 align:middle line:84%
but African Americans see
that as bumpy and uneven

00:47:06.260 --> 00:47:09.940 align:middle line:84%
as that road is,
there is progression.

00:47:09.940 --> 00:47:11.340 align:middle line:90%
Whereas white people--

00:47:11.340 --> 00:47:12.340 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Not seeing it.

00:47:12.340 --> 00:47:14.007 align:middle line:84%
>>BYNUM: --not seeing
it, and oftentimes

00:47:14.007 --> 00:47:16.780 align:middle line:90%
feeling that they're losing out.

00:47:16.780 --> 00:47:21.250 align:middle line:10%
And this is why you get a
lot of reactionary folks.

00:47:21.250 --> 00:47:27.370 align:middle line:10%
You know, you will not
replace us motif and feeling

00:47:27.370 --> 00:47:33.160 align:middle line:10%
that I'm losing out on
the great game here,

00:47:33.160 --> 00:47:38.640 align:middle line:10%
because that is
their perception.

00:47:38.640 --> 00:47:42.030 align:middle line:84%
And it is also the
case that unfortunately

00:47:42.030 --> 00:47:45.480 align:middle line:84%
because of our recently
COVID situation and lots

00:47:45.480 --> 00:47:47.460 align:middle line:84%
of other factors,
white people are not

00:47:47.460 --> 00:47:50.760 align:middle line:84%
living as long as they used
to in the United States,

00:47:50.760 --> 00:47:54.390 align:middle line:84%
and there's a perceived
population decline.

00:47:54.390 --> 00:47:56.520 align:middle line:84%
And we haven't even
talked about what's

00:47:56.520 --> 00:48:00.270 align:middle line:84%
happening with global warming
and the eroding of the ozone

00:48:00.270 --> 00:48:03.532 align:middle line:84%
and how that's going to affect
people with lighter skin.

00:48:03.532 --> 00:48:05.032 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: We didn't
even get to-- we

00:48:05.032 --> 00:48:06.330 align:middle line:90%
didn't get to any of this here.

00:48:06.330 --> 00:48:07.920 align:middle line:90%
We got to-- all right.

00:48:07.920 --> 00:48:09.900 align:middle line:84%
How about if we
just have you back?

00:48:09.900 --> 00:48:15.060 align:middle line:84%
>>BYNUM: It's not
basal carcinoma is not

00:48:15.060 --> 00:48:17.160 align:middle line:90%

00:48:17.160 --> 00:48:18.540 align:middle line:90%

00:48:28.140 --> 00:48:30.557 align:middle line:84%
appreciate the fact that you've
put your academic research

00:48:30.557 --> 00:48:33.930 align:middle line:84%
in as well as your spiritual
research into this topic

00:48:33.930 --> 00:48:37.380 align:middle line:84%
to bring us such a-- just such
a gentle and cohesive story

00:48:37.380 --> 00:48:40.110 align:middle line:84%

>>BYNUM: Well, I really, really,
really thoroughly enjoyed

00:48:45.840 --> 00:48:48.900 align:middle line:84%

the opportunity to meet and talk

00:48:48.900 --> 00:48:49.830 align:middle line:90%

>>REGINA: One way or another.

00:48:53.270 --> 00:48:53.370 align:middle line:90%

Loads of food for
thought in that book.

00:49:03.720 --> 00:49:04.900 align:middle line:90%
Definitely worth a read.
