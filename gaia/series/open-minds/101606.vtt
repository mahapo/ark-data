00:00:27.419 --> 00:00:29.960 align:middle line:10%
>>REGINA MEREDITH: How can it
be that over the course of just

00:00:29.960 --> 00:00:33.130 align:middle line:10%
two decades, our children are
deemed to be suddenly broken

00:00:33.130 --> 00:00:35.500 align:middle line:10%
to the extent that most
of them are recommended

00:00:35.500 --> 00:00:39.070 align:middle line:10%
medication for some disorder or
another, not the least of which

00:00:39.070 --> 00:00:41.300 align:middle line:10%
is for behavior modification?

00:00:41.300 --> 00:00:44.520 align:middle line:84%
I think we can agree that
something is terribly wrong.

00:00:44.520 --> 00:00:47.870 align:middle line:84%
I'm thrilled to have our guest
Kim John Payne with us today

00:00:47.870 --> 00:00:51.320 align:middle line:84%
to give his perspectives on
how this mad, mad world we've

00:00:51.320 --> 00:00:53.880 align:middle line:90%
created is ruining childhood.

00:00:53.880 --> 00:00:56.850 align:middle line:84%
He's the author of
"Simplicity Parenting."

00:00:56.850 --> 00:00:57.810 align:middle line:90%
Welcome to the show.

00:00:57.810 --> 00:00:59.770 align:middle line:90%
I'm so excited to have you here.

00:00:59.770 --> 00:00:59.970 align:middle line:84%
>>KIM JOHN PAYNE: It's
great to be here, Regina.

00:00:59.970 --> 00:01:01.803 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: This is one
of my favorite topics.

00:01:01.803 --> 00:01:04.584 align:middle line:84%
And you're the pioneer--
you're a pioneer.

00:01:04.584 --> 00:01:06.500 align:middle line:84%
Probably don't want to
lay all of that on you.

00:01:06.500 --> 00:01:09.710 align:middle line:84%
But you're a major
pioneer in this field.

00:01:09.710 --> 00:01:13.420 align:middle line:84%
And my entry came
because I've seen

00:01:13.420 --> 00:01:15.780 align:middle line:84%
the effects of
the Waldorf system

00:01:15.780 --> 00:01:17.110 align:middle line:90%
over a long period of time.

00:01:17.110 --> 00:01:20.730 align:middle line:84%
And Waldorf was part of
your background as well.

00:01:20.730 --> 00:01:21.670 align:middle line:90%
>>PAYNE: Yeah, it was.

00:01:21.670 --> 00:01:27.040 align:middle line:10%
Before moving into education,
I trained in psychology.

00:01:27.040 --> 00:01:28.050 align:middle line:10%
And I'm OK now.

00:01:28.050 --> 00:01:30.373 align:middle line:10%
I always add that
I'm perfectly--

00:01:30.373 --> 00:01:31.456 align:middle line:10%
>>REGINA: You're not nuts?

00:01:31.456 --> 00:01:33.190 align:middle line:10%
>>PAYNE: Yeah, perfectly fine.

00:01:33.190 --> 00:01:35.650 align:middle line:10%
And then, yeah,
Waldorf education,

00:01:35.650 --> 00:01:38.060 align:middle line:10%
I was naturally drawn
to that because I

00:01:38.060 --> 00:01:40.680 align:middle line:10%
could see right away
in Waldorf education

00:01:40.680 --> 00:01:43.470 align:middle line:10%
there was an emphasis
on whole child.

00:01:43.470 --> 00:01:46.530 align:middle line:84%
But there was an emphasis
on simplicity and balance,

00:01:46.530 --> 00:01:50.230 align:middle line:84%
on each and every day
being balanced for a child,

00:01:50.230 --> 00:01:53.920 align:middle line:84%
not only emphasis on
academics but also

00:01:53.920 --> 00:01:57.000 align:middle line:84%
an emphasis on
practical arts as well

00:01:57.000 --> 00:02:00.400 align:middle line:84%
and how they interface with
the sciences and the academics.

00:02:00.400 --> 00:02:02.520 align:middle line:84%
So I could see a
balanced education.

00:02:02.520 --> 00:02:04.660 align:middle line:84%
And that's initially
what drew me.

00:02:04.660 --> 00:02:07.060 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: From there, there
was a point in your life

00:02:07.060 --> 00:02:09.120 align:middle line:84%
where you were
living in Jakarta.

00:02:09.120 --> 00:02:11.910 align:middle line:84%
And you had already
had some background.

00:02:11.910 --> 00:02:16.040 align:middle line:84%
You were already dialed into the
way children were developing.

00:02:16.040 --> 00:02:19.110 align:middle line:84%
But this was a really important
part of your discovery,

00:02:19.110 --> 00:02:20.780 align:middle line:90%
living in Asia.

00:02:20.780 --> 00:02:24.882 align:middle line:84%
Tell us what happened there that
really concentrated your focus.

00:02:24.882 --> 00:02:25.465 align:middle line:90%
>>PAYNE: Yeah.

00:02:25.465 --> 00:02:28.540 align:middle line:84%
As an undergrad,
I was studying--

00:02:28.540 --> 00:02:31.220 align:middle line:84%
I got very interested in the
effects of trauma and stress

00:02:31.220 --> 00:02:34.880 align:middle line:84%
in the Second World
War, Korea, Vietnam War.

00:02:34.880 --> 00:02:36.800 align:middle line:84%
And back then, it was
called trauma response.

00:02:36.800 --> 00:02:39.420 align:middle line:84%
And I became very
interested in how similar

00:02:39.420 --> 00:02:42.780 align:middle line:84%
the descriptions of
combat veterans who

00:02:42.780 --> 00:02:45.500 align:middle line:84%
weren't coping so
well, how similar that

00:02:45.500 --> 00:02:48.310 align:middle line:84%
was to the kids I was
working with in a group home.

00:02:48.310 --> 00:02:51.170 align:middle line:84%
And it was a puzzle because
it wasn't meant to cross over,

00:02:51.170 --> 00:02:53.440 align:middle line:90%
but there was a crossover.

00:02:53.440 --> 00:02:57.760 align:middle line:84%
It was often discussed about
nervous, jumpy, hyper-vigilant,

00:02:57.760 --> 00:03:00.880 align:middle line:90%
over-controlling, night terrors.

00:03:00.880 --> 00:03:04.530 align:middle line:84%
All this was portrayed
as being the things

00:03:04.530 --> 00:03:06.680 align:middle line:84%
that combat veterans
were struggling with.

00:03:06.680 --> 00:03:10.000 align:middle line:84%
And yet I was seeing the kids
in my group home in pretty

00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:11.870 align:middle line:90%
much the same dilemma.

00:03:11.870 --> 00:03:13.330 align:middle line:90%
And that was a puzzle.

00:03:13.330 --> 00:03:16.320 align:middle line:84%
But then when I went and
volunteered and traveled

00:03:16.320 --> 00:03:19.250 align:middle line:84%
in Southeast Asia, but
first in Indonesia and then

00:03:19.250 --> 00:03:22.500 align:middle line:84%
in the Thai Cambodian
refugee camps, there again

00:03:22.500 --> 00:03:25.540 align:middle line:84%
I saw kids nervous,
jumpy, hyper-vigilant,

00:03:25.540 --> 00:03:28.100 align:middle line:90%
over-controlling, and so on.

00:03:28.100 --> 00:03:31.360 align:middle line:84%
We could probably, most of
us, get our sort of minds

00:03:31.360 --> 00:03:34.020 align:middle line:84%
around that, because these
kids were in a war zone.

00:03:34.020 --> 00:03:36.690 align:middle line:84%
But they weren't
combat veterans.

00:03:36.690 --> 00:03:38.834 align:middle line:90%
But it was more understandable.

00:03:38.834 --> 00:03:40.500 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: They dealt
with the insecurity

00:03:40.500 --> 00:03:42.010 align:middle line:90%
of that environment every day.

00:03:42.010 --> 00:03:43.070 align:middle line:90%
>>PAYNE: Yeah.

00:03:43.070 --> 00:03:45.080 align:middle line:84%
But again, it was a
crossover thing that

00:03:45.080 --> 00:03:46.430 align:middle line:90%
wasn't meant to be happening.

00:03:46.430 --> 00:03:49.496 align:middle line:84%
Like the psychological, it's
really strict in its diagnosis.

00:03:49.496 --> 00:03:50.870 align:middle line:84%
But here's the
interesting thing,

00:03:50.870 --> 00:03:56.210 align:middle line:84%
is when I then made the
jump and I moved to the UK

00:03:56.210 --> 00:03:59.860 align:middle line:84%
and was working with just
a regular cohort of kids

00:03:59.860 --> 00:04:02.730 align:middle line:84%
from mixed economic
backgrounds, mixed social,

00:04:02.730 --> 00:04:07.720 align:middle line:84%
mixed ethnic backgrounds,
there again I saw these kids.

00:04:07.720 --> 00:04:10.340 align:middle line:84%
And they looked
like wartime kids,

00:04:10.340 --> 00:04:13.190 align:middle line:84%
only they were coming
from typical backgrounds.

00:04:13.190 --> 00:04:15.490 align:middle line:84%
And so I came to think of
it as the undeclared war

00:04:15.490 --> 00:04:16.980 align:middle line:90%
on childhood.

00:04:16.980 --> 00:04:22.420 align:middle line:84%
And it was disturbing but at the
same time very, very revealing.

00:04:22.420 --> 00:04:26.200 align:middle line:84%
And most of all, there was
a conundrum and a puzzle

00:04:26.200 --> 00:04:28.552 align:middle line:90%
right there in that time.

00:04:28.552 --> 00:04:30.135 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Well, and
if you look, then,

00:04:30.135 --> 00:04:32.660 align:middle line:84%
to the United
States, which hasn't

00:04:32.660 --> 00:04:35.130 align:middle line:84%
had to deal with war
on its own turf--

00:04:35.130 --> 00:04:36.880 align:middle line:84%
we were talking
off camera, and you

00:04:36.880 --> 00:04:40.530 align:middle line:84%
said the latest statistics
are that the US consumes

00:04:40.530 --> 00:04:45.210 align:middle line:84%
92% of the global
Ritalin supply for kids

00:04:45.210 --> 00:04:49.444 align:middle line:84%
who are jumpy, controlling,
OCD, all these different things.

00:04:49.444 --> 00:04:50.160 align:middle line:90%
>>PAYNE: Yeah.

00:04:50.160 --> 00:04:54.260 align:middle line:84%
A very significant
amount of medication

00:04:54.260 --> 00:04:55.260 align:middle line:90%
is used here in the US.

00:04:55.260 --> 00:04:57.590 align:middle line:84%
Other countries are
catching up, unfortunately.

00:04:57.590 --> 00:05:00.870 align:middle line:84%
But having traveled
around the world, what

00:05:00.870 --> 00:05:04.890 align:middle line:84%
I see anecdotally is where
the pace of life is faster,

00:05:04.890 --> 00:05:08.870 align:middle line:90%
the medication need increases.

00:05:08.870 --> 00:05:13.840 align:middle line:84%
And the pace of life
here in the US is fast.

00:05:13.840 --> 00:05:16.550 align:middle line:84%
And we're got to a
stage where we're almost

00:05:16.550 --> 00:05:19.070 align:middle line:90%
living life at a fever pitch.

00:05:19.070 --> 00:05:22.270 align:middle line:84%
And the problem is that
it's become the new normal.

00:05:22.270 --> 00:05:23.340 align:middle line:90%
It's very ubiquitous.

00:05:23.340 --> 00:05:25.120 align:middle line:90%
It's become now accepted.

00:05:25.120 --> 00:05:27.930 align:middle line:84%
So if you look around
your neighbors, other kids

00:05:27.930 --> 00:05:33.180 align:middle line:84%
at school, and so on,
many parents would say,

00:05:33.180 --> 00:05:35.710 align:middle line:84%
well, we're just doing what
everyone else is doing.

00:05:35.710 --> 00:05:41.702 align:middle line:84%
So the fast pace, fever pitch,
too much too soon, too sexy

00:05:41.702 --> 00:05:45.300 align:middle line:84%
too young, it's
become the new normal.

00:05:45.300 --> 00:05:47.860 align:middle line:84%
And a lot of parents
are challenging

00:05:47.860 --> 00:05:50.760 align:middle line:84%
that now because
at a gut level--

00:05:50.760 --> 00:05:53.800 align:middle line:84%
there's nothing like
parenting to get to your gut,

00:05:53.800 --> 00:05:58.170 align:middle line:84%
to get to your heart forces and
to that gut instinctual level.

00:05:58.170 --> 00:06:00.080 align:middle line:84%
And a lot of parents
for a long time

00:06:00.080 --> 00:06:02.480 align:middle line:84%
now have been figuring, you
know, something is wrong.

00:06:02.480 --> 00:06:03.800 align:middle line:90%
Something is up.

00:06:03.800 --> 00:06:05.400 align:middle line:90%
This is not OK.

00:06:05.400 --> 00:06:09.415 align:middle line:84%
And our gut brain will kind
of trump our head brain.

00:06:09.415 --> 00:06:12.480 align:middle line:90%
It just takes longer.

00:06:12.480 --> 00:06:16.290 align:middle line:84%
And that's why maybe
10, 15 years ago,

00:06:16.290 --> 00:06:18.520 align:middle line:84%
talking about
simplicity, balance,

00:06:18.520 --> 00:06:22.640 align:middle line:84%
and dialing back life for kids
was a little counterculture,

00:06:22.640 --> 00:06:23.610 align:middle line:90%
frankly.

00:06:23.610 --> 00:06:28.350 align:middle line:84%
Whereas now it's right in
the middle of what so many

00:06:28.350 --> 00:06:29.890 align:middle line:90%
folk are talking about.

00:06:29.890 --> 00:06:32.980 align:middle line:84%
It's become a very
common conversation

00:06:32.980 --> 00:06:35.240 align:middle line:90%
piece, is that this is crazy.

00:06:35.240 --> 00:06:37.830 align:middle line:90%
This doesn't feel good.

00:06:37.830 --> 00:06:39.700 align:middle line:90%
Do we just have to accept this?

00:06:39.700 --> 00:06:42.890 align:middle line:84%
And I guess that's where
"Simplicity Parenting" stepped

00:06:42.890 --> 00:06:45.550 align:middle line:84%
right into the middle--
almost unwittingly,

00:06:45.550 --> 00:06:47.810 align:middle line:84%
but stepped right into
the middle of that.

00:06:47.810 --> 00:06:49.290 align:middle line:90%
Because it offers--

00:06:49.290 --> 00:06:51.137 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: It was
filling a mass need.

00:06:51.137 --> 00:06:51.720 align:middle line:90%
>>PAYNE: Yeah.

00:06:51.720 --> 00:06:54.876 align:middle line:84%
It offers solutions rather
than just observations.

00:06:54.876 --> 00:06:57.050 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Absolutely.

00:06:57.050 --> 00:07:00.379 align:middle line:84%
>>PAYNE: And the solutions
are very, well, simple.

00:07:00.379 --> 00:07:01.170 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: They are.

00:07:01.170 --> 00:07:03.128 align:middle line:84%
But there are things that
need to be considered

00:07:03.128 --> 00:07:06.040 align:middle line:84%
that most people have not
considered, because they feel

00:07:06.040 --> 00:07:09.140 align:middle line:84%
the pressure by
their parental peers,

00:07:09.140 --> 00:07:12.040 align:middle line:84%
for example, that oh my
god, that little kid already

00:07:12.040 --> 00:07:13.640 align:middle line:84%
knows how to read
and he's only three.

00:07:13.640 --> 00:07:15.890 align:middle line:90%
And our son can't read yet.

00:07:15.890 --> 00:07:19.140 align:middle line:84%
And it really becomes--
well, and as you say,

00:07:19.140 --> 00:07:20.190 align:middle line:90%
it is ubiquitous.

00:07:20.190 --> 00:07:22.740 align:middle line:84%
So there's nothing to
check one's self against.

00:07:22.740 --> 00:07:25.290 align:middle line:84%
It's just feeling like,
oh, our family, our child,

00:07:25.290 --> 00:07:26.890 align:middle line:84%
our children are
all falling behind.

00:07:26.890 --> 00:07:29.620 align:middle line:84%
And I want to just
set a little scenario.

00:07:29.620 --> 00:07:31.700 align:middle line:84%
And this is based on
the Waldorf system,

00:07:31.700 --> 00:07:33.900 align:middle line:84%
but it embraces
those principles.

00:07:33.900 --> 00:07:35.620 align:middle line:84%
So I want to set
this, before we go

00:07:35.620 --> 00:07:40.020 align:middle line:90%
into the story of little James.

00:07:40.020 --> 00:07:42.800 align:middle line:84%
In my son's class, I've
had the observation

00:07:42.800 --> 00:07:45.250 align:middle line:84%
now over the course
of, in our family,

00:07:45.250 --> 00:07:47.900 align:middle line:84%
many years-- between
my sister's children

00:07:47.900 --> 00:07:50.660 align:middle line:84%
and my son, 30 years
of watching them

00:07:50.660 --> 00:07:53.740 align:middle line:84%
go through that
particular system, where,

00:07:53.740 --> 00:07:57.630 align:middle line:84%
again, simplicity is
the rule, so to speak.

00:07:57.630 --> 00:08:01.010 align:middle line:84%
And one thing I noticed,
I've noticed repeatedly,

00:08:01.010 --> 00:08:03.870 align:middle line:84%
is that the kids in our family,
but also the kids in, say,

00:08:03.870 --> 00:08:07.520 align:middle line:84%
my son's class, who are
now in their early 30s,

00:08:07.520 --> 00:08:13.190 align:middle line:84%
they came out of it somehow
more alive, creatively intact

00:08:13.190 --> 00:08:14.500 align:middle line:90%
but more so.

00:08:14.500 --> 00:08:17.840 align:middle line:84%
You could see by the time
they were 12, 13, 14,

00:08:17.840 --> 00:08:21.280 align:middle line:84%
really what their passions
and souls' desires were.

00:08:21.280 --> 00:08:24.790 align:middle line:84%
And they stayed
very close to it,

00:08:24.790 --> 00:08:30.279 align:middle line:84%
right down to one kid, who
he was kind of a slacker

00:08:30.279 --> 00:08:32.570 align:middle line:84%
and he loved to smoke weed
and everyone thought, what's

00:08:32.570 --> 00:08:33.789 align:middle line:90%
going to happen to him?

00:08:33.789 --> 00:08:35.740 align:middle line:90%
Least likely to succeed.

00:08:35.740 --> 00:08:39.590 align:middle line:84%
He's probably doing the best
financially because he really

00:08:39.590 --> 00:08:42.150 align:middle line:84%
was into the
anthroposophical gardening,

00:08:42.150 --> 00:08:43.025 align:middle line:90%
biodynamic gardening.

00:08:43.025 --> 00:08:46.630 align:middle line:84%
He became a master
marijuana hybridizer

00:08:46.630 --> 00:08:51.112 align:middle line:84%
for medical facilities,
for dispensaries.

00:08:51.112 --> 00:08:52.080 align:middle line:90%
>>PAYNE: Go figure.

00:08:52.080 --> 00:08:54.460 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So yeah,
even him, least

00:08:54.460 --> 00:08:58.750 align:middle line:84%
likely to succeed actually lived
his passion, which was weed.

00:08:58.750 --> 00:09:02.110 align:middle line:90%


00:09:02.110 --> 00:09:03.700 align:middle line:84%
And I thought it
was so interesting.

00:09:03.700 --> 00:09:05.283 align:middle line:84%
>>PAYNE: We've got
to be quick to add,

00:09:05.283 --> 00:09:07.149 align:middle line:84%
that's not a class they
take in the school.

00:09:07.149 --> 00:09:08.190 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: -No, it is not.

00:09:08.190 --> 00:09:08.990 align:middle line:90%
It is not.

00:09:08.990 --> 00:09:11.350 align:middle line:84%
But he did pay attention
to the gardening.

00:09:11.350 --> 00:09:15.610 align:middle line:84%
And so I just say that kind of
in jest, but that all of them

00:09:15.610 --> 00:09:19.600 align:middle line:84%
ended up being the human beings
that you could see that seed

00:09:19.600 --> 00:09:22.780 align:middle line:84%
contained very early in
life, veterinarians, singers,

00:09:22.780 --> 00:09:24.720 align:middle line:90%
artists, and more.

00:09:24.720 --> 00:09:26.872 align:middle line:90%
Even lawyers.

00:09:26.872 --> 00:09:28.580 align:middle line:84%
>>PAYNE: Especially
scientists, actually.

00:09:28.580 --> 00:09:30.560 align:middle line:84%
A lot of kids who graduate
from Waldorf schools

00:09:30.560 --> 00:09:32.917 align:middle line:84%
are very attracted
to the science.

00:09:32.917 --> 00:09:33.500 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:09:33.500 --> 00:09:35.910 align:middle line:84%
And we're going to
now back engineer

00:09:35.910 --> 00:09:39.170 align:middle line:84%
that story as to how that
effect can come about,

00:09:39.170 --> 00:09:42.125 align:middle line:84%
by talking about little
James in your first chapter.

00:09:42.125 --> 00:09:43.980 align:middle line:90%
You changed all of their names.

00:09:43.980 --> 00:09:46.850 align:middle line:84%
But little James, oh,
I just felt so badly

00:09:46.850 --> 00:09:50.160 align:middle line:84%
for him, this terribly
hyper-vigilant little child.

00:09:50.160 --> 00:09:53.590 align:middle line:84%
But it was the result of
family dynamics trying to help

00:09:53.590 --> 00:09:54.970 align:middle line:90%
the kid grow up too fast.

00:09:54.970 --> 00:09:56.850 align:middle line:84%
>>PAYNE: It's almost
like we're trying

00:09:56.850 --> 00:10:00.690 align:middle line:84%
to pack 18 years of development
into the first eight years.

00:10:00.690 --> 00:10:03.550 align:middle line:90%
And it's concertinaed up.

00:10:03.550 --> 00:10:05.680 align:middle line:90%
And it compresses.

00:10:05.680 --> 00:10:09.910 align:middle line:84%
And it stresses as it
compresses children.

00:10:09.910 --> 00:10:16.320 align:middle line:84%
And for some kids, their heads
become like little light bulbs,

00:10:16.320 --> 00:10:18.210 align:middle line:84%
and they become
very switched on.

00:10:18.210 --> 00:10:20.106 align:middle line:84%
They become very
anxious, nervous,

00:10:20.106 --> 00:10:21.230 align:middle line:90%
they're picking up details.

00:10:21.230 --> 00:10:24.060 align:middle line:84%
And they basically go into a
little bit of a fight or flight

00:10:24.060 --> 00:10:25.130 align:middle line:90%
response.

00:10:25.130 --> 00:10:29.570 align:middle line:84%
And for James, what
he was doing is

00:10:29.570 --> 00:10:33.525 align:middle line:84%
that he had been given access
to a ton of adult information.

00:10:33.525 --> 00:10:36.080 align:middle line:90%


00:10:36.080 --> 00:10:41.940 align:middle line:84%
And he'd internalized it and
almost bird-like, very nervous,

00:10:41.940 --> 00:10:48.100 align:middle line:84%
he would just sit in the
backseat of a car and just

00:10:48.100 --> 00:10:51.086 align:middle line:84%
really just run off with
all these things that

00:10:51.086 --> 00:10:52.210 align:middle line:90%
were going on in the world.

00:10:52.210 --> 00:10:54.350 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Especially
environmental, global,

00:10:54.350 --> 00:10:55.700 align:middle line:90%
catastrophe.

00:10:55.700 --> 00:11:00.410 align:middle line:84%
>>PAYNE: Very disaster minded,
really worried about the world.

00:11:00.410 --> 00:11:04.510 align:middle line:84%
My concern when I was working
with that family, when

00:11:04.510 --> 00:11:07.890 align:middle line:84%
I was speaking with
them, was that you

00:11:07.890 --> 00:11:09.780 align:middle line:84%
don't want to burn
your kid out with too

00:11:09.780 --> 00:11:12.660 align:middle line:84%
much of that information too
soon, because then by the time

00:11:12.660 --> 00:11:14.570 align:middle line:90%
they get to 16, they're done.

00:11:14.570 --> 00:11:16.260 align:middle line:90%
They're done with it.

00:11:16.260 --> 00:11:19.950 align:middle line:84%
If you want a 16, 17,
18-year-old or into their 20s

00:11:19.950 --> 00:11:21.810 align:middle line:84%
to take hold of the
world, to really change

00:11:21.810 --> 00:11:25.270 align:middle line:84%
the things that are wrong, to
make it a more beautiful world,

00:11:25.270 --> 00:11:28.230 align:middle line:84%
when they're
little, we're really

00:11:28.230 --> 00:11:32.206 align:middle line:84%
well-advised to actually give
the children a beautiful world,

00:11:32.206 --> 00:11:34.080 align:middle line:84%
to let them know there's
beauty in the world.

00:11:34.080 --> 00:11:35.520 align:middle line:90%
There's beautiful people.

00:11:35.520 --> 00:11:37.130 align:middle line:90%
There's safe places to be.

00:11:37.130 --> 00:11:37.970 align:middle line:90%
It's good.

00:11:37.970 --> 00:11:39.430 align:middle line:90%
This is a good world.

00:11:39.430 --> 00:11:42.250 align:middle line:84%
If we want to have
them in the later life

00:11:42.250 --> 00:11:44.560 align:middle line:84%
to make it a good
world, then we have

00:11:44.560 --> 00:11:47.117 align:middle line:84%
to give them the template of
what a good world looks like,

00:11:47.117 --> 00:11:49.200 align:middle line:84%
because otherwise how are
they going to change it?

00:11:49.200 --> 00:11:51.650 align:middle line:84%
What do they change
it to if they've been

00:11:51.650 --> 00:11:54.330 align:middle line:90%
raised on a diet of disaster?

00:11:54.330 --> 00:11:58.085 align:middle line:84%
If they've been raised on
a diet of global warming,

00:11:58.085 --> 00:12:00.390 align:middle line:90%
of conflicts around the world.

00:12:00.390 --> 00:12:04.890 align:middle line:84%
And basically any information
that one gives a child younger

00:12:04.890 --> 00:12:07.830 align:middle line:84%
than the age of nine
should be something

00:12:07.830 --> 00:12:10.890 align:middle line:90%
they can do something about.

00:12:10.890 --> 00:12:13.780 align:middle line:84%
My basic rule of thumb--
there's two of them, really.

00:12:13.780 --> 00:12:17.310 align:middle line:84%
The first one is that if they
can't do anything about it,

00:12:17.310 --> 00:12:18.630 align:middle line:90%
don't tell them.

00:12:18.630 --> 00:12:22.680 align:middle line:84%
If they can't enter into it
and really figure something out

00:12:22.680 --> 00:12:25.840 align:middle line:84%
where they can take
part, don't tell them.

00:12:25.840 --> 00:12:29.740 align:middle line:84%
And the other rule of thumb
is I ask myself four really

00:12:29.740 --> 00:12:32.660 align:middle line:84%
basic questions before I say
anything in front of my kids

00:12:32.660 --> 00:12:34.400 align:middle line:90%
when they were little.

00:12:34.400 --> 00:12:35.740 align:middle line:90%
Is it true?

00:12:35.740 --> 00:12:36.870 align:middle line:90%
Is it kind?

00:12:36.870 --> 00:12:38.110 align:middle line:90%
Is it necessary?

00:12:38.110 --> 00:12:40.370 align:middle line:90%
And will it make them feel safe?

00:12:40.370 --> 00:12:42.450 align:middle line:84%
That crucial piece
of, does it make

00:12:42.450 --> 00:12:45.970 align:middle line:84%
me feel this is a good world,
this is a beautiful world?

00:12:45.970 --> 00:12:50.422 align:middle line:84%
I remember one dead who
was a serial explainer.

00:12:50.422 --> 00:12:51.380 align:middle line:90%
Do you know what I man?

00:12:51.380 --> 00:12:54.160 align:middle line:90%
He would explain everything.

00:12:54.160 --> 00:12:56.210 align:middle line:84%
And I was speaking
with him and his wife.

00:12:56.210 --> 00:13:00.100 align:middle line:84%
And they agreed--
their child wasn't

00:13:00.100 --> 00:13:02.290 align:middle line:90%
one that talked a lot about it.

00:13:02.290 --> 00:13:05.380 align:middle line:84%
It was a child who shrank
back from them, who was really

00:13:05.380 --> 00:13:07.634 align:middle line:90%
pulling away from them.

00:13:07.634 --> 00:13:08.550 align:middle line:90%
And they were worried.

00:13:08.550 --> 00:13:13.860 align:middle line:84%
She was four years old, and yet
she was not engaging with them.

00:13:13.860 --> 00:13:16.090 align:middle line:84%
And they wondered if
something was wrong.

00:13:16.090 --> 00:13:18.170 align:middle line:90%
Is there a diagnosis?

00:13:18.170 --> 00:13:19.210 align:middle line:90%
And so they came to me.

00:13:19.210 --> 00:13:22.170 align:middle line:84%
And my diagnosis was,
don't talk so much.

00:13:22.170 --> 00:13:26.380 align:middle line:84%
It's kind of a weird diagnosis,
but just quiet it all down,

00:13:26.380 --> 00:13:29.150 align:middle line:84%
particularly about
the over-analyzing,

00:13:29.150 --> 00:13:33.030 align:middle line:84%
particularly the moment would
talk about global catastrophe,

00:13:33.030 --> 00:13:34.850 align:middle line:90%
the dad would super-analyze.

00:13:34.850 --> 00:13:38.370 align:middle line:84%
And so one day they were sitting
on the edge of the bathtub,

00:13:38.370 --> 00:13:40.000 align:middle line:90%
having agreed this.

00:13:40.000 --> 00:13:43.580 align:middle line:84%
And the daughter
picked up a toothbrush.

00:13:43.580 --> 00:13:45.350 align:middle line:84%
And she was holding
it up to the light,

00:13:45.350 --> 00:13:47.200 align:middle line:84%
and she was noticing
the colors that

00:13:47.200 --> 00:13:49.200 align:middle line:90%
were projected on the wall.

00:13:49.200 --> 00:13:50.890 align:middle line:84%
And she was holding
it up and saying,

00:13:50.890 --> 00:13:53.760 align:middle line:90%
look, Daddy, pink, now blue.

00:13:53.760 --> 00:13:55.410 align:middle line:84%
And the dad sat on
the edge of the bath

00:13:55.410 --> 00:13:58.560 align:middle line:84%
and began a color
analysis lecture.

00:13:58.560 --> 00:14:00.310 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Telling them
about the spectrum?

00:14:00.310 --> 00:14:01.300 align:middle line:90%
>>PAYNE: Yeah, really.

00:14:01.300 --> 00:14:03.820 align:middle line:84%
And the mother
gave him the look--

00:14:03.820 --> 00:14:06.010 align:middle line:84%
you know, the
look-- because they

00:14:06.010 --> 00:14:08.450 align:middle line:84%
had agreed that they would
only speak about things

00:14:08.450 --> 00:14:10.100 align:middle line:90%
that brought wonder and awe.

00:14:10.100 --> 00:14:15.140 align:middle line:84%
That was their template-- wonder
and awe to the four year old.

00:14:15.140 --> 00:14:18.020 align:middle line:84%
In awe of the world, it
is a wonderful place.

00:14:18.020 --> 00:14:20.030 align:middle line:84%
And so he stopped,
and then he just

00:14:20.030 --> 00:14:24.880 align:middle line:84%
enjoyed the pinkness and the
spectrum and the blueness.

00:14:24.880 --> 00:14:28.380 align:middle line:84%
And she walked around with that
toothbrush for days, pulling it

00:14:28.380 --> 00:14:29.860 align:middle line:90%
out wherever there was sun.

00:14:29.860 --> 00:14:32.527 align:middle line:84%
And wherever Daddy was there--
should we look here, Daddy?

00:14:32.527 --> 00:14:33.610 align:middle line:90%
And they would look again.

00:14:33.610 --> 00:14:34.984 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So she
was re-engaging.

00:14:34.984 --> 00:14:37.040 align:middle line:84%
>>PAYNE: She was
re-engaging with him.

00:14:37.040 --> 00:14:39.190 align:middle line:84%
And the dad, when he
told this simple story

00:14:39.190 --> 00:14:41.740 align:middle line:90%
about the toothbrush, teared up.

00:14:41.740 --> 00:14:47.490 align:middle line:84%
Because he said, I had no idea
that my adult conversations

00:14:47.490 --> 00:14:51.160 align:middle line:84%
and my analyzing was
disengaging me from the most

00:14:51.160 --> 00:14:52.520 align:middle line:90%
precious thing in my life.

00:14:52.520 --> 00:14:53.270 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:14:53.270 --> 00:14:57.510 align:middle line:84%
And you know, you were
talking about the analysis

00:14:57.510 --> 00:14:59.930 align:middle line:84%
before you spoke that you
went through in terms of what

00:14:59.930 --> 00:15:01.270 align:middle line:90%
you shared with your children.

00:15:01.270 --> 00:15:06.970 align:middle line:84%
And it seems to me, maybe the
number one would be safety.

00:15:06.970 --> 00:15:08.730 align:middle line:90%
Will it make my child feel safe?

00:15:08.730 --> 00:15:12.010 align:middle line:84%
Because the reality
is, children are

00:15:12.010 --> 00:15:17.840 align:middle line:84%
being born into what is being
spun as a very dangerous world

00:15:17.840 --> 00:15:20.790 align:middle line:90%
from everything externally.

00:15:20.790 --> 00:15:21.800 align:middle line:90%
>>PAYNE: Right.

00:15:21.800 --> 00:15:25.550 align:middle line:84%
And if they buy
into I'm not safe,

00:15:25.550 --> 00:15:28.150 align:middle line:84%
what happens is,
with my interest

00:15:28.150 --> 00:15:32.940 align:middle line:84%
in neuro-psych and
into neurobiology,

00:15:32.940 --> 00:15:37.080 align:middle line:84%
is it's pretty much now accepted
that in the first couple

00:15:37.080 --> 00:15:40.230 align:middle line:84%
of years of life, the only
question a little child wants

00:15:40.230 --> 00:15:42.731 align:middle line:90%
to have answered is, am I safe?

00:15:42.731 --> 00:15:43.230 align:middle line:90%
Am I safe?

00:15:43.230 --> 00:15:44.220 align:middle line:90%
Can I trust?

00:15:44.220 --> 00:15:45.580 align:middle line:90%
Can I take the world in?

00:15:45.580 --> 00:15:47.590 align:middle line:90%
Can I give myself to the world?

00:15:47.590 --> 00:15:49.560 align:middle line:84%
Can I just be a
part of all this?

00:15:49.560 --> 00:15:51.770 align:middle line:84%
Now, if there's a lot of
stress going on and a lot

00:15:51.770 --> 00:15:55.250 align:middle line:84%
of conversation about things
that a child just cannot

00:15:55.250 --> 00:15:59.970 align:middle line:84%
understand, can't take a
hold of, what happens is that

00:15:59.970 --> 00:16:04.650 align:middle line:84%
the child stays in a slightly
arrested neurological state.

00:16:04.650 --> 00:16:08.640 align:middle line:84%
And so all that wonderful
whoosh of brain development that

00:16:08.640 --> 00:16:12.240 align:middle line:84%
comes through into the age
of six or seven years old

00:16:12.240 --> 00:16:14.550 align:middle line:84%
is actually
dramatically inhibited

00:16:14.550 --> 00:16:16.730 align:middle line:84%
because they still haven't
answered that question,

00:16:16.730 --> 00:16:18.030 align:middle line:90%
am I safe.

00:16:18.030 --> 00:16:19.944 align:middle line:84%
So they stay in that
kind of safety brain.

00:16:19.944 --> 00:16:21.360 align:middle line:84%
They still stay
in the protected--

00:16:21.360 --> 00:16:23.325 align:middle line:90%
I've got to protect myself.

00:16:23.325 --> 00:16:25.700 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Well, let's talk
about it from a brain function

00:16:25.700 --> 00:16:28.650 align:middle line:84%
point of view, in the frontal
lobe development and fear,

00:16:28.650 --> 00:16:30.840 align:middle line:84%
and what fear does
to inhibit that.

00:16:30.840 --> 00:16:34.020 align:middle line:84%
>>PAYNE: Well, you see, the
amygdala, the fight or flight,

00:16:34.020 --> 00:16:36.170 align:middle line:84%
the reptilian brain,
in modern life,

00:16:36.170 --> 00:16:41.600 align:middle line:84%
it's almost become the reptile
with a crown, the lizard king.

00:16:41.600 --> 00:16:47.030 align:middle line:84%
It's become the ruler of our
brain-- that fight or flight,

00:16:47.030 --> 00:16:50.420 align:middle line:84%
I would add, freeze
or flock brain.

00:16:50.420 --> 00:16:53.690 align:middle line:84%
Because our kids are being
given so much information

00:16:53.690 --> 00:16:58.270 align:middle line:84%
via screens, via our unguarded
conversations, which I think

00:16:58.270 --> 00:17:02.490 align:middle line:84%
are just as troubling as
screens, when we dial back

00:17:02.490 --> 00:17:05.530 align:middle line:84%
those conversations, when
we can dial them back,

00:17:05.530 --> 00:17:07.720 align:middle line:84%
the frontal lobes
start to kick in,

00:17:07.720 --> 00:17:09.119 align:middle line:84%
which is the
collaborative brain,

00:17:09.119 --> 00:17:11.579 align:middle line:84%
the empathy brain,
the learning brain,

00:17:11.579 --> 00:17:14.940 align:middle line:84%
the brain that just
welcomes newness,

00:17:14.940 --> 00:17:18.270 align:middle line:90%
welcomes all kinds of new stuff.

00:17:18.270 --> 00:17:22.450 align:middle line:84%
When we dial the amount of
stuff that our children have

00:17:22.450 --> 00:17:26.000 align:middle line:84%
to digest, what happens is
that their collaborative,

00:17:26.000 --> 00:17:29.770 align:middle line:84%
creative brain really
starts to fire.

00:17:29.770 --> 00:17:31.740 align:middle line:90%
And that's all about learning.

00:17:31.740 --> 00:17:34.120 align:middle line:90%
That's all about being a friend.

00:17:34.120 --> 00:17:37.480 align:middle line:84%
That's all about being a good
brother or a good sister,

00:17:37.480 --> 00:17:40.120 align:middle line:90%
being fun, being creative.

00:17:40.120 --> 00:17:41.980 align:middle line:84%
So what a lot of
parents have discovered

00:17:41.980 --> 00:17:45.880 align:middle line:84%
is that when they simplify
and balance their lives,

00:17:45.880 --> 00:17:52.260 align:middle line:84%
a lot of the niggly behavior
that happens between kids,

00:17:52.260 --> 00:17:56.430 align:middle line:84%
a lot of the stuff that's antsy
between kids, very quickly--

00:17:56.430 --> 00:18:00.360 align:middle line:84%
and this is not surprising,
because in a sense,

00:18:00.360 --> 00:18:01.660 align:middle line:90%
the brain is fast.

00:18:01.660 --> 00:18:04.600 align:middle line:84%
In terms of the hormones,
they can flush the system.

00:18:04.600 --> 00:18:07.530 align:middle line:84%
Within a couple of weeks,
you see a real change

00:18:07.530 --> 00:18:09.730 align:middle line:84%
in the behavior of
the child, being

00:18:09.730 --> 00:18:11.847 align:middle line:84%
able to relax, being
able to sleep better.

00:18:11.847 --> 00:18:13.430 align:middle line:84%
For little children
particularly, they

00:18:13.430 --> 00:18:14.630 align:middle line:90%
can sleep better.

00:18:14.630 --> 00:18:16.620 align:middle line:90%
They can eat better.

00:18:16.620 --> 00:18:18.620 align:middle line:90%
And they can potty better.

00:18:18.620 --> 00:18:21.240 align:middle line:84%
Because if you think about it,
if a child doesn't feel safe,

00:18:21.240 --> 00:18:25.630 align:middle line:84%
a little one, what's their
fallback control mechanism?

00:18:25.630 --> 00:18:28.070 align:middle line:90%
Sleeping, eating, and pooping.

00:18:28.070 --> 00:18:30.790 align:middle line:84%
And they'll try and hang
on and control that,

00:18:30.790 --> 00:18:33.750 align:middle line:84%
so that they can't let you
go out the room at night

00:18:33.750 --> 00:18:37.310 align:middle line:84%
because they're afraid to
be on their own, and so on.

00:18:37.310 --> 00:18:40.165 align:middle line:84%
So those three key things,
because the "Simplicity

00:18:40.165 --> 00:18:45.090 align:middle line:84%
Parenting" movement is
so large-- we have 600,

00:18:45.090 --> 00:18:48.560 align:middle line:84%
700 trainers, coaches
around the world,

00:18:48.560 --> 00:18:50.420 align:middle line:84%
and just countless
ten of thousands--

00:18:50.420 --> 00:18:51.586 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Exploding, though.

00:18:51.586 --> 00:18:52.790 align:middle line:90%
>>PAYNE: Exploding.

00:18:52.790 --> 00:18:55.610 align:middle line:84%
The book is translated
into I think it's now 12

00:18:55.610 --> 00:18:58.680 align:middle line:84%
and soon to be 15 different
languages, and so on and so on.

00:18:58.680 --> 00:19:01.940 align:middle line:84%
So what's interesting about
that is we have people

00:19:01.940 --> 00:19:04.400 align:middle line:84%
from very many
different cultures

00:19:04.400 --> 00:19:08.790 align:middle line:84%
reporting exactly the same
thing, that when they simplify

00:19:08.790 --> 00:19:12.360 align:middle line:84%
and balance family
life, what happens

00:19:12.360 --> 00:19:16.150 align:middle line:90%
is the connection increases.

00:19:16.150 --> 00:19:18.900 align:middle line:84%
Because really, all
"Simplicity Parenting"

00:19:18.900 --> 00:19:23.580 align:middle line:84%
really is is a vehicle
for deeper connection.

00:19:23.580 --> 00:19:27.260 align:middle line:84%
Simplicity is nothing
in itself, per se.

00:19:27.260 --> 00:19:32.550 align:middle line:84%
It opens up a space where we
can deeply connect to our kids.

00:19:32.550 --> 00:19:34.190 align:middle line:90%
That's really what it's about.

00:19:34.190 --> 00:19:35.180 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:19:35.180 --> 00:19:37.264 align:middle line:84%
OK, now, let's
talk about a day--

00:19:37.264 --> 00:19:38.805 align:middle line:84%
say if you were
doing a consultation,

00:19:38.805 --> 00:19:42.020 align:middle line:84%
a day in a family's life,
a day of observation.

00:19:42.020 --> 00:19:43.790 align:middle line:84%
And you've said,
there are people

00:19:43.790 --> 00:19:46.810 align:middle line:84%
that you will make that
offer and say, look,

00:19:46.810 --> 00:19:50.400 align:middle line:84%
you can let me into your
home to observe you for a day

00:19:50.400 --> 00:19:53.100 align:middle line:84%
or go through months and
months of counseling.

00:19:53.100 --> 00:19:53.740 align:middle line:90%
Your choice.

00:19:53.740 --> 00:19:55.640 align:middle line:84%
And they'll look at
each other and say,

00:19:55.640 --> 00:19:57.611 align:middle line:90%
we'll take the counseling.

00:19:57.611 --> 00:19:59.486 align:middle line:84%
>>PAYNE: Yeah, two or
three years of therapy.

00:19:59.486 --> 00:19:59.930 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah, exactly.

00:19:59.930 --> 00:20:01.805 align:middle line:84%
>>PAYNE: Well, we have
"Simplicity Parenting"

00:20:01.805 --> 00:20:04.390 align:middle line:84%
counselors all around the
world doing exactly this now.

00:20:04.390 --> 00:20:07.062 align:middle line:84%
They'll spend a day--
we've learned to spread it

00:20:07.062 --> 00:20:08.020 align:middle line:90%
over a couple of weeks.

00:20:08.020 --> 00:20:11.260 align:middle line:84%
So a couple hours of early
morning, seeing the children.

00:20:11.260 --> 00:20:12.580 align:middle line:90%
Then you'll get up.

00:20:12.580 --> 00:20:15.090 align:middle line:84%
And then a couple of
days later, visit again.

00:20:15.090 --> 00:20:18.840 align:middle line:84%
And you get a picture
of the parents' day.

00:20:18.840 --> 00:20:22.650 align:middle line:84%
And one of the really
interesting pieces about that

00:20:22.650 --> 00:20:26.575 align:middle line:84%
is that most parents--
many parents now

00:20:26.575 --> 00:20:31.070 align:middle line:84%
are understanding that there
is a benefit to dialing back.

00:20:31.070 --> 00:20:33.790 align:middle line:90%
This has just gone crazy.

00:20:33.790 --> 00:20:36.015 align:middle line:90%
Just it's too much going on.

00:20:36.015 --> 00:20:40.640 align:middle line:84%
And what's really interesting
is that of the discoveries

00:20:40.640 --> 00:20:43.410 align:middle line:84%
that I came across
fairly early on

00:20:43.410 --> 00:20:46.310 align:middle line:84%
was that when you start
simplifying and balancing

00:20:46.310 --> 00:20:49.290 align:middle line:84%
a child's life,
things start to shift.

00:20:49.290 --> 00:20:54.220 align:middle line:84%
Now, I mentioned some a moment
ago, but slightly more--

00:20:54.220 --> 00:20:57.300 align:middle line:84%
you know, a little more inflamed
than that is that you have--

00:20:57.300 --> 00:21:00.670 align:middle line:84%
I've worked with so many
children who are so-called ADD,

00:21:00.670 --> 00:21:03.840 align:middle line:84%
ODD, PDD, OCD,
there's a lot of D's.

00:21:03.840 --> 00:21:05.590 align:middle line:90%
We can take our pick.

00:21:05.590 --> 00:21:09.850 align:middle line:84%
And I'm not disputing
that there are these D's.

00:21:09.850 --> 00:21:10.900 align:middle line:90%
Sure thing.

00:21:10.900 --> 00:21:17.020 align:middle line:84%
But when parents start
simplifying and balancing,

00:21:17.020 --> 00:21:19.640 align:middle line:84%
that challenging behavior
and emotional presentation

00:21:19.640 --> 00:21:24.580 align:middle line:84%
becomes softer, and it
becomes just quirky.

00:21:24.580 --> 00:21:27.270 align:middle line:84%
The same thing that
is a disorder when

00:21:27.270 --> 00:21:31.870 align:middle line:84%
you add cumulative stress, under
the radar cumulative stress,

00:21:31.870 --> 00:21:35.980 align:middle line:84%
all a disorder is is
an inflamed quirk.

00:21:35.980 --> 00:21:36.890 align:middle line:90%
That's all it is.

00:21:36.890 --> 00:21:38.020 align:middle line:90%
If you've got a busy kid--

00:21:38.020 --> 00:21:39.311 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: And we're all quirky.

00:21:39.311 --> 00:21:42.050 align:middle line:84%
>>PAYNE: Well, who
isn't quirky, right?

00:21:42.050 --> 00:21:46.050 align:middle line:84%
But you add stress to that,
and it slides along a spectrum.

00:21:46.050 --> 00:21:47.930 align:middle line:90%
So the busy kid becomes ADD.

00:21:47.930 --> 00:21:50.280 align:middle line:90%
The orderly kid becomes OCD.

00:21:50.280 --> 00:21:52.590 align:middle line:90%
And so on and so on.

00:21:52.590 --> 00:21:54.200 align:middle line:84%
But the simple
answer-- and this is

00:21:54.200 --> 00:21:58.080 align:middle line:84%
what's so hopeful about this,
is that you start simplifying

00:21:58.080 --> 00:22:02.020 align:middle line:84%
and balancing, kids who perhaps
oppositional and defiant

00:22:02.020 --> 00:22:03.915 align:middle line:84%
and they're pushing
back hard against you

00:22:03.915 --> 00:22:06.040 align:middle line:84%
or against their teachers
or against their brothers

00:22:06.040 --> 00:22:10.600 align:middle line:84%
and sisters, they start moving
back along that spectrum,

00:22:10.600 --> 00:22:14.270 align:middle line:84%
so to speak, and they
become just quirky again.

00:22:14.270 --> 00:22:17.790 align:middle line:84%
I'm not disputing that we
don't all have tendencies,

00:22:17.790 --> 00:22:20.350 align:middle line:84%
but it's the cumulative,
under the radar

00:22:20.350 --> 00:22:23.630 align:middle line:84%
stress that as a society
we've come to accept.

00:22:23.630 --> 00:22:26.220 align:middle line:84%
And many, many parents
now are not accepting it,

00:22:26.220 --> 00:22:27.580 align:middle line:90%
so they slide it back.

00:22:27.580 --> 00:22:29.160 align:middle line:90%
They simplify and balance.

00:22:29.160 --> 00:22:31.118 align:middle line:84%
And they feel like they've
got their little boy

00:22:31.118 --> 00:22:32.220 align:middle line:90%
or girl back again.

00:22:32.220 --> 00:22:33.209 align:middle line:90%
It is so touching.

00:22:33.209 --> 00:22:33.750 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: OK.

00:22:33.750 --> 00:22:35.720 align:middle line:84%
Now, let's start with
their environment.

00:22:35.720 --> 00:22:39.377 align:middle line:84%
And you're really
big on less stuff.

00:22:39.377 --> 00:22:40.210 align:middle line:90%
>>PAYNE: Well, yeah.

00:22:40.210 --> 00:22:41.794 align:middle line:84%
Less stuff because
one of the things--

00:22:41.794 --> 00:22:43.209 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Let's
start with babies.

00:22:43.209 --> 00:22:44.620 align:middle line:90%
I mean, OK, a baby's born.

00:22:44.620 --> 00:22:47.130 align:middle line:84%
Everybody brings a lot
of stuff to the baby.

00:22:47.130 --> 00:22:48.310 align:middle line:90%
The room starts filling up.

00:22:48.310 --> 00:22:50.140 align:middle line:84%
>>PAYNE: It's like
a toy tsunami.

00:22:50.140 --> 00:22:52.400 align:middle line:84%
Yeah, from the
unrelenting parents,

00:22:52.400 --> 00:22:56.122 align:middle line:90%
in-laws, Christmas givers.

00:22:56.122 --> 00:22:59.170 align:middle line:84%
One of the things that
I noticed-- and this

00:22:59.170 --> 00:23:00.530 align:middle line:90%
wasn't an invention.

00:23:00.530 --> 00:23:03.870 align:middle line:90%
My nickname was Dr. Trash Bag.

00:23:03.870 --> 00:23:05.940 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: You show up
with, what are they called,

00:23:05.940 --> 00:23:07.750 align:middle line:90%
the handyman size bags?

00:23:07.750 --> 00:23:09.970 align:middle line:90%
Big garbage bags, black ones.

00:23:09.970 --> 00:23:14.470 align:middle line:84%
>>PAYNE: And it wasn't
just out of coincidence,

00:23:14.470 --> 00:23:16.457 align:middle line:84%
because I would ask the
parents, because I'm

00:23:16.457 --> 00:23:17.540 align:middle line:90%
the simplicity guy, right?

00:23:17.540 --> 00:23:18.873 align:middle line:90%
So what do you want to simplify?

00:23:18.873 --> 00:23:20.750 align:middle line:84%
And a lot of
parents would choose

00:23:20.750 --> 00:23:23.780 align:middle line:90%
to simplify their environment.

00:23:23.780 --> 00:23:25.490 align:middle line:84%
So we would go into
a child's bedroom.

00:23:25.490 --> 00:23:28.370 align:middle line:84%
I'd stand with a bag,
and in would go the toys.

00:23:28.370 --> 00:23:29.960 align:middle line:90%
One parent was usually gleeful.

00:23:29.960 --> 00:23:32.570 align:middle line:90%
The other was kind of ashen.

00:23:32.570 --> 00:23:36.120 align:middle line:84%
And we would be in with all
those really annoying toys,

00:23:36.120 --> 00:23:40.116 align:middle line:84%
the toys that do things
where you push buttons.

00:23:40.116 --> 00:23:41.740 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: The ones
that need batteries.

00:23:41.740 --> 00:23:43.060 align:middle line:84%
>>PAYNE: The ones
that need batteries,

00:23:43.060 --> 00:23:44.240 align:middle line:90%
they were always first.

00:23:44.240 --> 00:23:45.510 align:middle line:90%
Disemboweled Barbies.

00:23:45.510 --> 00:23:47.070 align:middle line:90%
I mean, lots of stuff.

00:23:47.070 --> 00:23:50.780 align:middle line:84%
And then we did the same
thing with toys, with books,

00:23:50.780 --> 00:23:56.770 align:middle line:84%
with clothes, just simplifying
and establishing a toy library.

00:23:56.770 --> 00:23:57.810 align:middle line:90%
Same with books.

00:23:57.810 --> 00:23:58.630 align:middle line:90%
Books are precious.

00:23:58.630 --> 00:24:00.820 align:middle line:84%
I mean, what is
rare is precious.

00:24:00.820 --> 00:24:03.330 align:middle line:84%
We forget about
the power of less.

00:24:03.330 --> 00:24:05.410 align:middle line:90%
What is rare is precious.

00:24:05.410 --> 00:24:09.160 align:middle line:84%
So I've seen countless
numbers of kids using books

00:24:09.160 --> 00:24:11.090 align:middle line:90%
as construction material.

00:24:11.090 --> 00:24:13.090 align:middle line:90%
And it makes me wince.

00:24:13.090 --> 00:24:15.490 align:middle line:90%
So fewer books, fewer clothes.

00:24:15.490 --> 00:24:17.420 align:middle line:90%
And it just feels fabulous.

00:24:17.420 --> 00:24:20.040 align:middle line:84%
Some parents ask me, do
you do this with the kids?

00:24:20.040 --> 00:24:22.250 align:middle line:84%
And my answer is, well,
it depends on your level

00:24:22.250 --> 00:24:23.480 align:middle line:90%
of masochism, frankly.

00:24:23.480 --> 00:24:25.499 align:middle line:90%
No, no, no, no, no.

00:24:25.499 --> 00:24:26.290 align:middle line:90%
No, you just do it.

00:24:26.290 --> 00:24:28.230 align:middle line:84%
You just go in,
and you just do it.

00:24:28.230 --> 00:24:30.325 align:middle line:84%
And we worry too much
about it as parents,

00:24:30.325 --> 00:24:31.700 align:middle line:84%
because the kids
come back-- now,

00:24:31.700 --> 00:24:33.491 align:middle line:84%
I'm talking about
thousands of kids, right?

00:24:33.491 --> 00:24:37.490 align:middle line:84%
Because our coaches do this,
because it's a fairly simple

00:24:37.490 --> 00:24:38.170 align:middle line:90%
little training.

00:24:38.170 --> 00:24:40.140 align:middle line:84%
It'd be kind of
ironic if the training

00:24:40.140 --> 00:24:43.560 align:middle line:84%
to be a "Simplicity Parenting"
coach was complicated.

00:24:43.560 --> 00:24:45.050 align:middle line:90%
That'd be too funny.

00:24:45.050 --> 00:24:47.970 align:middle line:84%
But now we have
thousands and thousands

00:24:47.970 --> 00:24:49.900 align:middle line:90%
of parents who have done this.

00:24:49.900 --> 00:24:53.350 align:middle line:84%
And it's only a handful of times
ever has a kid objected to it.

00:24:53.350 --> 00:24:56.256 align:middle line:84%
Because they come in, and
it's their space to play.

00:24:56.256 --> 00:24:57.130 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: To breathe.

00:24:57.130 --> 00:24:58.530 align:middle line:90%
>>PAYNE: To breathe, to be.

00:24:58.530 --> 00:25:00.760 align:middle line:84%
And one of the comments
we get over and over

00:25:00.760 --> 00:25:03.040 align:middle line:84%
is that parents
comment, well, hang on,

00:25:03.040 --> 00:25:05.910 align:middle line:84%
how is it that my kids
are playing better?

00:25:05.910 --> 00:25:07.900 align:middle line:84%
Because there's less
toys, why are they

00:25:07.900 --> 00:25:11.910 align:middle line:84%
playing so much more with
each other and cooperating?

00:25:11.910 --> 00:25:13.750 align:middle line:84%
Again, the answer is
in the brain science,

00:25:13.750 --> 00:25:15.790 align:middle line:84%
because if you have
less stuff, you

00:25:15.790 --> 00:25:18.600 align:middle line:84%
have to get creative
with how you use it.

00:25:18.600 --> 00:25:20.930 align:middle line:84%
If you get creative
with how you use it,

00:25:20.930 --> 00:25:23.950 align:middle line:84%
the limbic system and
back to the frontal lobe

00:25:23.950 --> 00:25:27.490 align:middle line:84%
starts to kick in, and that's
the collaborative brain.

00:25:27.490 --> 00:25:30.364 align:middle line:90%
So less means more cooperation.

00:25:30.364 --> 00:25:31.572 align:middle line:90%
So that's the first kind of--

00:25:31.572 --> 00:25:32.660 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: And more imagination.

00:25:32.660 --> 00:25:33.493 align:middle line:90%
>>PAYNE: Absolutely.

00:25:33.493 --> 00:25:34.960 align:middle line:84%
And then this
wonderful plaything

00:25:34.960 --> 00:25:37.842 align:middle line:90%
called nature starts kicking in.

00:25:37.842 --> 00:25:39.550 align:middle line:84%
Kids start going out
and doing-- and I've

00:25:39.550 --> 00:25:41.710 align:middle line:84%
notice that the best
toys, the keepers,

00:25:41.710 --> 00:25:44.980 align:middle line:84%
the toys that kids
really gravitate towards,

00:25:44.980 --> 00:25:46.570 align:middle line:90%
is not the fancy gift.

00:25:46.570 --> 00:25:48.315 align:middle line:90%
It's the box it came in.

00:25:48.315 --> 00:25:50.190 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: I was just
going to make a comment.

00:25:50.190 --> 00:25:52.080 align:middle line:84%
A woman that I had
such respect for,

00:25:52.080 --> 00:25:55.680 align:middle line:84%
just a beautiful little sparkly
woman with tattoos all over

00:25:55.680 --> 00:25:58.590 align:middle line:84%
and sparkles on her cheeks,
when she would go somewhere

00:25:58.590 --> 00:26:00.990 align:middle line:84%
with her little kids
who were high-energy

00:26:00.990 --> 00:26:04.770 align:middle line:84%
but adorable and creative, she'd
drag along an old cardboard

00:26:04.770 --> 00:26:06.450 align:middle line:90%
box, a moving box.

00:26:06.450 --> 00:26:07.200 align:middle line:90%
That's it.

00:26:07.200 --> 00:26:09.900 align:middle line:84%
And then she'd say, now,
remember who was up on the hill

00:26:09.900 --> 00:26:10.670 align:middle line:90%
yesterday.

00:26:10.670 --> 00:26:13.440 align:middle line:90%
And she'd construct the box.

00:26:13.440 --> 00:26:16.427 align:middle line:84%
And that became the castle, the
home, whatever they were doing.

00:26:16.427 --> 00:26:18.010 align:middle line:84%
>>PAYNE: The rocketship,
the whatever.

00:26:18.010 --> 00:26:22.950 align:middle line:84%
But the more children
change that object, the more

00:26:22.950 --> 00:26:25.870 align:middle line:84%
the collaborative brain
starts kicking in.

00:26:25.870 --> 00:26:28.410 align:middle line:84%
That's why toys
with that batteries

00:26:28.410 --> 00:26:32.460 align:middle line:84%
cause so many arguments,
because they're not cooperative.

00:26:32.460 --> 00:26:35.000 align:middle line:84%
You sit and you
passively push a button,

00:26:35.000 --> 00:26:37.480 align:middle line:90%
and the thing does something.

00:26:37.480 --> 00:26:41.300 align:middle line:84%
And so it's not actually
stimulating any cooperation,

00:26:41.300 --> 00:26:43.170 align:middle line:90%
because it does just one thing.

00:26:43.170 --> 00:26:44.087 align:middle line:90%
That's what it does.

00:26:44.087 --> 00:26:46.170 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And you can fight
over possession of it.

00:26:46.170 --> 00:26:47.000 align:middle line:90%
That's as far as it goes.

00:26:47.000 --> 00:26:48.375 align:middle line:84%
>>PAYNE: Right,
because you don't

00:26:48.375 --> 00:26:50.480 align:middle line:84%
have to cooperate to
actually make it do anything.

00:26:50.480 --> 00:26:50.940 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:26:50.940 --> 00:26:53.356 align:middle line:84%
And the rooms that you painted
the picture of in your book

00:26:53.356 --> 00:26:55.140 align:middle line:84%
with words, I love
it, because you're

00:26:55.140 --> 00:26:58.230 align:middle line:84%
talking about rooms that
now, there's less stuff,

00:26:58.230 --> 00:27:00.080 align:middle line:90%
you can see what stuff there is.

00:27:00.080 --> 00:27:03.250 align:middle line:84%
You can actually focus--
maybe your 30 or 40

00:27:03.250 --> 00:27:04.772 align:middle line:90%
books have been narrowed down.

00:27:04.772 --> 00:27:06.730 align:middle line:84%
They've been put away
somewhere, where you only

00:27:06.730 --> 00:27:08.830 align:middle line:90%
see five or six books.

00:27:08.830 --> 00:27:12.520 align:middle line:84%
And I love the part where
in this one girl's room

00:27:12.520 --> 00:27:18.150 align:middle line:84%
you had swaths of color fabric,
string, and clothespins.

00:27:18.150 --> 00:27:20.470 align:middle line:84%
And she was just-- and
she was a little kid

00:27:20.470 --> 00:27:22.130 align:middle line:90%
that had some control issues.

00:27:22.130 --> 00:27:25.510 align:middle line:84%
And she was just lost in
creating these little houses

00:27:25.510 --> 00:27:27.150 align:middle line:84%
and environments
out of the fabric.

00:27:27.150 --> 00:27:27.940 align:middle line:90%
>>PAYNE: Yeah.

00:27:27.940 --> 00:27:32.690 align:middle line:84%
And because she's lost in that
world, when a child gets lost

00:27:32.690 --> 00:27:36.330 align:middle line:84%
in the play world, something
very precious is happening,

00:27:36.330 --> 00:27:36.830 align:middle line:90%
isn't it?

00:27:36.830 --> 00:27:38.490 align:middle line:90%
And we look at it.

00:27:38.490 --> 00:27:40.705 align:middle line:84%
And I don't mean to be
overly scientific about it,

00:27:40.705 --> 00:27:45.610 align:middle line:84%
but when a child is lost
in that deep creative play,

00:27:45.610 --> 00:27:47.050 align:middle line:90%
they're processing.

00:27:47.050 --> 00:27:48.695 align:middle line:84%
They're actually
processing the day.

00:27:48.695 --> 00:27:50.930 align:middle line:84%
They're processing
the stressors.

00:27:50.930 --> 00:27:53.380 align:middle line:84%
They're actually
working through a lot.

00:27:53.380 --> 00:27:56.820 align:middle line:84%
But they're working through
it, in a sense, metaphorically.

00:27:56.820 --> 00:27:59.260 align:middle line:84%
They'll play out the
stresses of the day.

00:27:59.260 --> 00:28:01.600 align:middle line:84%
You listen to their chatter,
and if they happened

00:28:01.600 --> 00:28:04.290 align:middle line:84%
to have been to the
doctor's clinic,

00:28:04.290 --> 00:28:07.170 align:middle line:84%
they're just chatting about it
as they put the things around.

00:28:07.170 --> 00:28:09.400 align:middle line:90%
And their processing.

00:28:09.400 --> 00:28:12.770 align:middle line:90%
Now, deep play takes time.

00:28:12.770 --> 00:28:15.030 align:middle line:90%
Deep play takes time.

00:28:15.030 --> 00:28:17.310 align:middle line:84%
And this is one of these
pillars of simplicity

00:28:17.310 --> 00:28:22.500 align:middle line:84%
because we've forgotten about
the need for boredom, what

00:28:22.500 --> 00:28:24.660 align:middle line:90%
I call the gift of boredom.

00:28:24.660 --> 00:28:27.110 align:middle line:84%
We've got to give kids
the gift of boredom.

00:28:27.110 --> 00:28:31.840 align:middle line:84%
Because if my kids come to me
and say, Daddy, we're bored.

00:28:31.840 --> 00:28:33.200 align:middle line:90%
There's nothing to do.

00:28:33.200 --> 00:28:35.670 align:middle line:90%
My response is, oh.

00:28:35.670 --> 00:28:38.331 align:middle line:90%
Oh, dear.

00:28:38.331 --> 00:28:38.830 align:middle line:90%
That's it.

00:28:38.830 --> 00:28:40.718 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: That's it.

00:28:40.718 --> 00:28:41.770 align:middle line:90%
Find something to do.

00:28:41.770 --> 00:28:42.959 align:middle line:90%
>>PAYNE: That's it.

00:28:42.959 --> 00:28:45.250 align:middle line:84%
20 minutes later-- and by
the way, for that 20 minutes,

00:28:45.250 --> 00:28:47.525 align:middle line:90%
separate them.

00:28:47.525 --> 00:28:50.090 align:middle line:90%
That's a little tip there.

00:28:50.090 --> 00:28:52.910 align:middle line:84%
But 20 minutes later, they're
creating, they're constructing,

00:28:52.910 --> 00:28:55.740 align:middle line:90%
they're doing.

00:28:55.740 --> 00:28:58.260 align:middle line:84%
When kids say we've got nothing
to do, that they're bored,

00:28:58.260 --> 00:28:59.990 align:middle line:84%
we've got to
out-bore the boring.

00:28:59.990 --> 00:29:02.720 align:middle line:84%
We've got to be
even more boring.

00:29:02.720 --> 00:29:04.567 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Don't give
them a ton of options.

00:29:04.567 --> 00:29:05.150 align:middle line:90%
>>PAYNE: Yeah.

00:29:05.150 --> 00:29:07.070 align:middle line:84%
And particularly
resist the screen.

00:29:07.070 --> 00:29:09.080 align:middle line:84%
Resist taking them
to the screen.

00:29:09.080 --> 00:29:12.000 align:middle line:84%
Because we think the screen is
creative, and it kind of is.

00:29:12.000 --> 00:29:13.710 align:middle line:84%
There's all sorts
of things to do.

00:29:13.710 --> 00:29:18.310 align:middle line:84%
But what we forget is that
it's someone else's creativity.

00:29:18.310 --> 00:29:20.700 align:middle line:90%
It's not the child's creativity.

00:29:20.700 --> 00:29:22.380 align:middle line:90%
It's someone else's.

00:29:22.380 --> 00:29:26.880 align:middle line:84%
And that's not doing
much inside for the child

00:29:26.880 --> 00:29:30.920 align:middle line:84%
that is passively observing
someone else's creativity.

00:29:30.920 --> 00:29:35.050 align:middle line:84%
And again, nothing much is going
on for a child in comparison

00:29:35.050 --> 00:29:36.719 align:middle line:90%
to that deep creative play.

00:29:36.719 --> 00:29:38.510 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Well, and
that's what you do too.

00:29:38.510 --> 00:29:40.800 align:middle line:84%
Once you clear the room
out, sometimes you'll

00:29:40.800 --> 00:29:42.100 align:middle line:90%
add a few things back in.

00:29:42.100 --> 00:29:46.500 align:middle line:84%
For example, they'll always have
a fat box of crayons and paper.

00:29:46.500 --> 00:29:47.594 align:middle line:90%
>>PAYNE: Tools.

00:29:47.594 --> 00:29:48.260 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Tools.

00:29:48.260 --> 00:29:50.940 align:middle line:84%
And maybe little
LEGO pieces and toys.

00:29:50.940 --> 00:29:52.735 align:middle line:84%
>>PAYNE: Yeah, and
big wooden blocks.

00:29:52.735 --> 00:29:54.590 align:middle line:84%
Big things they can
get their arms around.

00:29:54.590 --> 00:29:55.840 align:middle line:90%
Tools are fabulous.

00:29:55.840 --> 00:29:59.705 align:middle line:84%
You can get them in garden
centers now, child sized.

00:29:59.705 --> 00:30:01.900 align:middle line:90%
But real tools.

00:30:01.900 --> 00:30:04.250 align:middle line:84%
Not plastic tools
that just are fake,

00:30:04.250 --> 00:30:07.047 align:middle line:84%
that just tell great
big kind of lies.

00:30:07.047 --> 00:30:07.880 align:middle line:90%
That's not a hammer.

00:30:07.880 --> 00:30:08.990 align:middle line:90%
That's a weird thing.

00:30:08.990 --> 00:30:09.620 align:middle line:90%
It's plastic.

00:30:09.620 --> 00:30:10.240 align:middle line:90%
It's light.

00:30:10.240 --> 00:30:10.970 align:middle line:90%
It doesn't weigh anything.

00:30:10.970 --> 00:30:11.600 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Air-filled
thing, yeah.

00:30:11.600 --> 00:30:13.550 align:middle line:84%
>>PAYNE: That means the world
is not telling me the truth.

00:30:13.550 --> 00:30:15.925 align:middle line:84%
I've seen little boys get a
hold of those plastic hammers

00:30:15.925 --> 00:30:18.510 align:middle line:84%
and look at them and
say, what is this?

00:30:18.510 --> 00:30:21.250 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So give them
little man toys and tools.

00:30:21.250 --> 00:30:23.990 align:middle line:84%
>>PAYNE: Yeah, Give the
boys and girls these tools.

00:30:23.990 --> 00:30:26.490 align:middle line:84%
Let them go out and
really dig, because when

00:30:26.490 --> 00:30:30.250 align:middle line:84%
they dig-- a lot of children
learn through imitating us.

00:30:30.250 --> 00:30:32.870 align:middle line:84%
So if they're out with their
shovel but it's a real shovel

00:30:32.870 --> 00:30:36.380 align:middle line:84%
and they're digging beside us,
or they're sawing besides us,

00:30:36.380 --> 00:30:39.335 align:middle line:84%
or they're working
beside us, that's

00:30:39.335 --> 00:30:41.460 align:middle line:84%
how little children learn
because that's the mirror

00:30:41.460 --> 00:30:42.990 align:middle line:90%
neurons in the brain.

00:30:42.990 --> 00:30:45.580 align:middle line:84%
They see what we're
doing, they mirror it,

00:30:45.580 --> 00:30:47.480 align:middle line:84%
and then they bring
it into their actions.

00:30:47.480 --> 00:30:50.630 align:middle line:84%
That's how kids develop,
not through passively

00:30:50.630 --> 00:30:53.370 align:middle line:84%
sitting and watching hours
and hours of screens a day.

00:30:53.370 --> 00:30:56.160 align:middle line:84%
The average American
kid 12 to 18 years old

00:30:56.160 --> 00:31:00.010 align:middle line:84%
now watches-- the Kaiser Family
Foundation study in 2011,

00:31:00.010 --> 00:31:03.110 align:middle line:84%
it's seven and a half
hours of screen a day,

00:31:03.110 --> 00:31:06.490 align:middle line:84%
and that's discounting
screens at school.

00:31:06.490 --> 00:31:06.990 align:middle line:90%
Right?

00:31:06.990 --> 00:31:08.695 align:middle line:90%
It's a full-time job.

00:31:08.695 --> 00:31:10.830 align:middle line:84%
And it really,
really is concerning

00:31:10.830 --> 00:31:12.410 align:middle line:90%
huge numbers of parents.

00:31:12.410 --> 00:31:13.820 align:middle line:90%
This has just gone crazy.

00:31:13.820 --> 00:31:17.340 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Well, now-- so another
sector of parents would say,

00:31:17.340 --> 00:31:19.890 align:middle line:84%
I'm not allowing my children
to sit in front of the screen.

00:31:19.890 --> 00:31:22.010 align:middle line:84%
And so instead what
they'll do is maybe

00:31:22.010 --> 00:31:26.060 align:middle line:84%
occupy them with loads of
lessons of all different kinds.

00:31:26.060 --> 00:31:29.650 align:middle line:84%
We go to our French
lesson when we're five,

00:31:29.650 --> 00:31:32.239 align:middle line:84%
and then after that go to
ballet and then maybe whatever.

00:31:32.239 --> 00:31:34.322 align:middle line:84%
>>PAYNE: And then to
psychotherapy to cope with it

00:31:34.322 --> 00:31:34.370 align:middle line:90%
all.

00:31:34.370 --> 00:31:36.445 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Yeah, to
psychotherapy, and then

00:31:36.445 --> 00:31:37.770 align:middle line:90%
to soccer practice.

00:31:37.770 --> 00:31:39.936 align:middle line:84%
>>PAYNE: And then more
psychotherapy, or medication.

00:31:39.936 --> 00:31:41.380 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And you
say in the book,

00:31:41.380 --> 00:31:45.150 align:middle line:84%
you're not against learning
and growing and having

00:31:45.150 --> 00:31:46.120 align:middle line:90%
rich experiences.

00:31:46.120 --> 00:31:48.730 align:middle line:84%
But tell us where
the dividing line

00:31:48.730 --> 00:31:51.575 align:middle line:90%
is between enough and too much.

00:31:51.575 --> 00:31:55.600 align:middle line:84%
>>PAYNE: Well, I'm not-- like,
you mentioned screens, Regina.

00:31:55.600 --> 00:31:57.770 align:middle line:90%
I'm not against screens.

00:31:57.770 --> 00:32:01.470 align:middle line:90%
I'm just for human relationship.

00:32:01.470 --> 00:32:04.970 align:middle line:84%
That's the thing
that screens and too

00:32:04.970 --> 00:32:09.590 align:middle line:90%
packed a life are displacing.

00:32:09.590 --> 00:32:13.664 align:middle line:84%
Like, did you ever have
a play date in your life?

00:32:13.664 --> 00:32:14.580 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: A play date?

00:32:14.580 --> 00:32:15.360 align:middle line:90%
>>PAYNE: A play date?

00:32:15.360 --> 00:32:15.830 align:middle line:90%
Did you ever have--

00:32:15.830 --> 00:32:16.610 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: What's that mean?

00:32:16.610 --> 00:32:17.235 align:middle line:90%
>>PAYNE: Right.

00:32:17.235 --> 00:32:17.840 align:middle line:90%
I know.

00:32:17.840 --> 00:32:19.810 align:middle line:84%
Play dates, that's
what kids have now.

00:32:19.810 --> 00:32:21.080 align:middle line:90%
They have play dates.

00:32:21.080 --> 00:32:21.880 align:middle line:90%
They don't play.

00:32:21.880 --> 00:32:23.109 align:middle line:90%
They have play dates.

00:32:23.109 --> 00:32:24.025 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Oh, god, no.

00:32:24.025 --> 00:32:25.710 align:middle line:90%
You just went out and played.

00:32:25.710 --> 00:32:26.850 align:middle line:90%
>>PAYNE: Right.

00:32:26.850 --> 00:32:28.287 align:middle line:84%
I didn't have a
play date either.

00:32:28.287 --> 00:32:30.370 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: You have to make
it-- you have to put it

00:32:30.370 --> 00:32:31.657 align:middle line:90%
in the calendar to play now?

00:32:31.657 --> 00:32:32.240 align:middle line:90%
>>PAYNE: Yeah.

00:32:32.240 --> 00:32:34.434 align:middle line:84%
And you deliver
kids, and they play.

00:32:34.434 --> 00:32:35.350 align:middle line:90%
Yeah, you didn't know?

00:32:35.350 --> 00:32:36.105 align:middle line:90%
Oh, there you go.

00:32:36.105 --> 00:32:36.750 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: No.

00:32:36.750 --> 00:32:39.079 align:middle line:84%
I mean, I finished the child
rearing thing a while ago.

00:32:39.079 --> 00:32:41.120 align:middle line:84%
>>PAYNE: You were outside
of the play date thing?

00:32:41.120 --> 00:32:42.870 align:middle line:90%
And you know, we're fine.

00:32:42.870 --> 00:32:46.110 align:middle line:90%
I think we're OKish, aren't we?

00:32:46.110 --> 00:32:48.520 align:middle line:84%
But what I'm suggesting is
that the ballet on Monday,

00:32:48.520 --> 00:32:52.249 align:middle line:84%
soccer on Tuesday, that
the tutoring on Wednesday--

00:32:52.249 --> 00:32:54.040 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Plus homework
by the age of four.

00:32:54.040 --> 00:32:56.415 align:middle line:10%
>>PAYNE: And the homework,
and the hour or two-- homework

00:32:56.415 --> 00:32:58.460 align:middle line:10%
is a huge problem.

00:32:58.460 --> 00:32:59.710 align:middle line:10%
I'm not a big fan of homework.

00:32:59.710 --> 00:33:02.070 align:middle line:10%
I'm a big fan of home life.

00:33:02.070 --> 00:33:07.480 align:middle line:84%
And homework is robbing us
of the time for home life.

00:33:07.480 --> 00:33:10.340 align:middle line:84%
Screens are robbing us
of time for home life.

00:33:10.340 --> 00:33:13.660 align:middle line:84%
Scheduling is robbing us
of time for home life.

00:33:13.660 --> 00:33:16.850 align:middle line:84%
If we can just-- this is the
weird thing about simplicity

00:33:16.850 --> 00:33:20.120 align:middle line:84%
and "Simplicity Parenting"
movement, this whole community,

00:33:20.120 --> 00:33:22.500 align:middle line:84%
is that someone
said to me way back,

00:33:22.500 --> 00:33:23.910 align:middle line:84%
this is a really
weird book, Kim,

00:33:23.910 --> 00:33:26.710 align:middle line:84%
because-- she had read
all these parenting books

00:33:26.710 --> 00:33:28.610 align:middle line:84%
and she said, I got
this and I was all

00:33:28.610 --> 00:33:30.860 align:middle line:90%
ready to have to take notes.

00:33:30.860 --> 00:33:33.280 align:middle line:84%
And I didn't take a
single-- like, you're not

00:33:33.280 --> 00:33:34.960 align:middle line:90%
saying do anything.

00:33:34.960 --> 00:33:39.104 align:middle line:84%
You're not saying do a
single thing in a whole book.

00:33:39.104 --> 00:33:40.520 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: It's
more about undoing.

00:33:40.520 --> 00:33:41.103 align:middle line:90%
>>PAYNE: Yeah.

00:33:41.103 --> 00:33:44.120 align:middle line:84%
Don't do, because I'm not a
big fan of parenting books,

00:33:44.120 --> 00:33:46.350 align:middle line:84%
which I know is weird
because I write them.

00:33:46.350 --> 00:33:49.710 align:middle line:84%
But I'm not a big fan of
them because what they do

00:33:49.710 --> 00:33:50.950 align:middle line:90%
is they de-alpha the parent.

00:33:50.950 --> 00:33:52.920 align:middle line:90%
They subjugate the parent.

00:33:52.920 --> 00:33:55.880 align:middle line:84%
Our kids need the parent to
be in the alpha position,

00:33:55.880 --> 00:34:00.570 align:middle line:84%
in that "I am a governor
of the family" state.

00:34:00.570 --> 00:34:05.150 align:middle line:84%
And a lot of parenting
books feel like you're

00:34:05.150 --> 00:34:07.360 align:middle line:90%
being placed below the expert.

00:34:07.360 --> 00:34:11.530 align:middle line:84%
There's the expert, and
then there's you below that.

00:34:11.530 --> 00:34:14.949 align:middle line:84%
"Simplicity Parenting" is just
saying, just strip it away.

00:34:14.949 --> 00:34:16.000 align:middle line:90%
Dial it back.

00:34:16.000 --> 00:34:17.110 align:middle line:90%
Do less.

00:34:17.110 --> 00:34:19.679 align:middle line:84%
But the really interesting
piece about this

00:34:19.679 --> 00:34:26.540 align:middle line:84%
is that what it's not suggesting
is wanting to go back in time,

00:34:26.540 --> 00:34:29.790 align:middle line:84%
wanting somehow that
this is a bad world.

00:34:29.790 --> 00:34:31.020 align:middle line:90%
It's a wonderful world.

00:34:31.020 --> 00:34:32.820 align:middle line:90%
It's a beautiful world.

00:34:32.820 --> 00:34:34.889 align:middle line:84%
And you only have to look
into your child's eyes

00:34:34.889 --> 00:34:38.800 align:middle line:84%
when they're out in the woods
to know how beautiful they're

00:34:38.800 --> 00:34:40.469 align:middle line:90%
seeing through those eyes.

00:34:40.469 --> 00:34:42.000 align:middle line:90%
It's a beautiful world.

00:34:42.000 --> 00:34:46.040 align:middle line:84%
But one of, I think,
the key points

00:34:46.040 --> 00:34:50.380 align:middle line:84%
of when you simplify and balance
and you dial back as a parent

00:34:50.380 --> 00:34:55.159 align:middle line:84%
is that you're actually putting
your child on a trajectory

00:34:55.159 --> 00:34:57.510 align:middle line:84%
to really succeed
in a modern world,

00:34:57.510 --> 00:34:59.607 align:middle line:84%
because the modern
world is changing.

00:34:59.607 --> 00:35:00.190 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:35:00.190 --> 00:35:01.250 align:middle line:90%
And I wanted to get into that.

00:35:01.250 --> 00:35:02.874 align:middle line:84%
But there's one thing
I wanted to catch

00:35:02.874 --> 00:35:03.940 align:middle line:90%
while we're right there.

00:35:03.940 --> 00:35:06.900 align:middle line:84%
It's not only your children
having too much stuff

00:35:06.900 --> 00:35:10.740 align:middle line:84%
and having too many lessons
and being pushed too fast.

00:35:10.740 --> 00:35:13.890 align:middle line:84%
There also is a point
at which there are too

00:35:13.890 --> 00:35:16.600 align:middle line:84%
many choices for
a child to make.

00:35:16.600 --> 00:35:18.950 align:middle line:84%
So if you'll just take
a moment to talk about,

00:35:18.950 --> 00:35:21.590 align:middle line:84%
where do you as a
parent say, this

00:35:21.590 --> 00:35:24.940 align:middle line:84%
is what we're going
to do, versus, honey,

00:35:24.940 --> 00:35:26.950 align:middle line:84%
we can do this,
this, this, and this.

00:35:26.950 --> 00:35:28.520 align:middle line:90%
Where is that line again too?

00:35:28.520 --> 00:35:31.020 align:middle line:84%
This is confusing
for a lot of parents.

00:35:31.020 --> 00:35:32.470 align:middle line:90%
>>PAYNE: It really is.

00:35:32.470 --> 00:35:35.560 align:middle line:84%
Like, if you're walking down
the beach, you're on vacation

00:35:35.560 --> 00:35:37.700 align:middle line:84%
and you're with your
two young children.

00:35:37.700 --> 00:35:39.897 align:middle line:84%
And you say to
your two boys, now,

00:35:39.897 --> 00:35:41.480 align:middle line:84%
who would like the
red bucket, and who

00:35:41.480 --> 00:35:42.688 align:middle line:90%
would like the yellow bucket?

00:35:42.688 --> 00:35:43.190 align:middle line:90%
You're done.

00:35:43.190 --> 00:35:45.900 align:middle line:90%
The day is done right there.

00:35:45.900 --> 00:35:47.820 align:middle line:90%
There's no more.

00:35:47.820 --> 00:35:51.170 align:middle line:84%
I'm not a big fan
of choices ahead

00:35:51.170 --> 00:35:54.160 align:middle line:84%
of a child's neurological
ability to make them.

00:35:54.160 --> 00:35:55.610 align:middle line:90%
We are giving children choices--

00:35:55.610 --> 00:35:57.180 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: The red and blue
we can make fairly early on.

00:35:57.180 --> 00:35:58.580 align:middle line:90%
>>PAYNE: --way too young.

00:35:58.580 --> 00:36:00.630 align:middle line:84%
But then they'll
argue about which,

00:36:00.630 --> 00:36:06.440 align:middle line:84%
who-- it's what I think
of as "you may" choices.

00:36:06.440 --> 00:36:11.080 align:middle line:84%
Now, a "you may" choice is
to set three cereals out

00:36:11.080 --> 00:36:14.250 align:middle line:84%
on the counter in the morning
and saying to your children,

00:36:14.250 --> 00:36:16.750 align:middle line:84%
you may choose any
one of these three,

00:36:16.750 --> 00:36:18.730 align:middle line:90%
because I'm OK with that.

00:36:18.730 --> 00:36:20.500 align:middle line:84%
Maybe you don't say
I'm OK with that,

00:36:20.500 --> 00:36:22.280 align:middle line:84%
but inwardly, because
I'm OK with that.

00:36:22.280 --> 00:36:25.680 align:middle line:84%
And then rather than
sitting out three or four,

00:36:25.680 --> 00:36:29.630 align:middle line:84%
one is the incredibly
expensive organic granola,

00:36:29.630 --> 00:36:33.410 align:middle line:84%
right down to cocoa pops, they
choose the cocoa pops, right?

00:36:33.410 --> 00:36:38.520 align:middle line:84%
And then you say, now, Sophia,
was that a poor choice,

00:36:38.520 --> 00:36:41.080 align:middle line:84%
a good choice, or
the best choice?

00:36:41.080 --> 00:36:44.340 align:middle line:84%
And she knows that that
wasn't the best choice.

00:36:44.340 --> 00:36:48.590 align:middle line:84%
And so over and over, by giving
our kids too many choices,

00:36:48.590 --> 00:36:50.080 align:middle line:90%
we stress them.

00:36:50.080 --> 00:36:55.220 align:middle line:84%
And we make them feel that
they're disappointing us.

00:36:55.220 --> 00:37:02.020 align:middle line:84%
And it disconnects us from kids,
because a little child's choice

00:37:02.020 --> 00:37:04.160 align:middle line:84%
is usually based
around their senses.

00:37:04.160 --> 00:37:06.140 align:middle line:84%
If you say to a little
child, if you've

00:37:06.140 --> 00:37:07.930 align:middle line:84%
got a new fancy
refrigerator and there's

00:37:07.930 --> 00:37:10.080 align:middle line:84%
a freezer at the
bottom-- not at the top

00:37:10.080 --> 00:37:12.170 align:middle line:84%
like it used to be in the
old days, at the bottom.

00:37:12.170 --> 00:37:16.000 align:middle line:84%
And you say, now, Alexander,
do not put your tongue

00:37:16.000 --> 00:37:18.600 align:middle line:90%
on the freezer tray.

00:37:18.600 --> 00:37:20.010 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Moth to a flame.

00:37:20.010 --> 00:37:20.680 align:middle line:90%
>>PAYNE: Right.

00:37:20.680 --> 00:37:23.920 align:middle line:84%
And you'll hear, Daddy, Daddy--
and he's put his tongue.

00:37:23.920 --> 00:37:26.580 align:middle line:84%
Why has he put--
why, I told you--

00:37:26.580 --> 00:37:28.870 align:middle line:84%
he's put his tongue on it
because little children make

00:37:28.870 --> 00:37:33.230 align:middle line:84%
choices through touching,
through feeling.

00:37:33.230 --> 00:37:35.530 align:middle line:84%
They don't make
morally guided choices,

00:37:35.530 --> 00:37:37.690 align:middle line:90%
cognitively based choices.

00:37:37.690 --> 00:37:39.390 align:middle line:90%
They make it through their body.

00:37:39.390 --> 00:37:42.610 align:middle line:84%
And yet so many
parents have bought

00:37:42.610 --> 00:37:46.540 align:middle line:84%
into this giving cognitive,
moral, ethical choices

00:37:46.540 --> 00:37:49.920 align:middle line:84%
to children, ahead of that
neurological development.

00:37:49.920 --> 00:37:54.710 align:middle line:84%
Our kids don't understand cause
and effect in a social sense,

00:37:54.710 --> 00:37:56.380 align:middle line:90%
in an emotional sense.

00:37:56.380 --> 00:37:58.020 align:middle line:84%
They understand
cause and effect,

00:37:58.020 --> 00:38:00.312 align:middle line:84%
crossing right left brain,
through their little bodies.

00:38:00.312 --> 00:38:02.686 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Like getting your
tongue stuck on the ice tray.

00:38:02.686 --> 00:38:03.940 align:middle line:90%
>>PAYNE: Through their bodies.

00:38:03.940 --> 00:38:07.340 align:middle line:84%
And so I'm not suggesting
that children shouldn't

00:38:07.340 --> 00:38:11.720 align:middle line:84%
have any choices, but the
choices are "you may" choices,

00:38:11.720 --> 00:38:15.800 align:middle line:84%
where then you as the adult,
as the governor of the family

00:38:15.800 --> 00:38:20.220 align:middle line:84%
state, keeping the family
safe and warm and secure,

00:38:20.220 --> 00:38:22.370 align:middle line:90%
allow a child to make a choice.

00:38:22.370 --> 00:38:26.750 align:middle line:84%
That says to a child, I can
choose, but my daddy or my mama

00:38:26.750 --> 00:38:29.830 align:middle line:84%
is in charge and
keeping me safe,

00:38:29.830 --> 00:38:33.340 align:middle line:84%
as opposed to giving
them all kinds of choices

00:38:33.340 --> 00:38:36.060 align:middle line:84%
that they don't have the cause
and effect understanding yet

00:38:36.060 --> 00:38:39.380 align:middle line:84%
to make and then inferring that
they've made the wrong choice.

00:38:39.380 --> 00:38:41.260 align:middle line:90%
That just stresses a child.

00:38:41.260 --> 00:38:42.120 align:middle line:90%
And we don't mean.

00:38:42.120 --> 00:38:44.170 align:middle line:84%
No one wakes up
thinking, I wonder

00:38:44.170 --> 00:38:46.110 align:middle line:90%
how I can stress my kids today.

00:38:46.110 --> 00:38:48.070 align:middle line:90%
No one does that, right?

00:38:48.070 --> 00:38:51.530 align:middle line:84%
But that's in effect what too
many choices too young do.

00:38:51.530 --> 00:38:53.190 align:middle line:90%
It disconnects us.

00:38:53.190 --> 00:38:55.920 align:middle line:84%
And our kids start
pulling back from us,

00:38:55.920 --> 00:38:58.390 align:middle line:84%
or start pounding on
us, start getting--

00:38:58.390 --> 00:39:00.640 align:middle line:84%
I remember one little girl
at the front of the school,

00:39:00.640 --> 00:39:03.070 align:middle line:84%
the mother-- I knew exactly
what book she'd been reading,

00:39:03.070 --> 00:39:05.220 align:middle line:84%
by the way, the mother,
the parenting book,

00:39:05.220 --> 00:39:08.400 align:middle line:84%
because she said
to the child, now,

00:39:08.400 --> 00:39:12.430 align:middle line:84%
would you like to
come back to my work,

00:39:12.430 --> 00:39:14.050 align:middle line:84%
would you like to
go to Daddy's work,

00:39:14.050 --> 00:39:15.900 align:middle line:84%
would you like to
go to the barn,

00:39:15.900 --> 00:39:18.307 align:middle line:84%
would you like to go to the
space shuttle-- I don't know,

00:39:18.307 --> 00:39:19.140 align:middle line:90%
she was giving her--

00:39:19.140 --> 00:39:20.181 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: What overwhelm.

00:39:20.181 --> 00:39:22.990 align:middle line:84%
>>PAYNE: And she was down at
her level, making eye contact.

00:39:22.990 --> 00:39:26.195 align:middle line:84%
Now, the little girl just was
getting more and more tense.

00:39:26.195 --> 00:39:28.550 align:middle line:90%
And she said, don't ask me.

00:39:28.550 --> 00:39:31.470 align:middle line:84%
And the mother said, now, why
don't you want me to ask you?

00:39:31.470 --> 00:39:33.510 align:middle line:84%
Is it because you're
feeling frustrated?

00:39:33.510 --> 00:39:36.430 align:middle line:84%
Is it because you're--
and the little girl,

00:39:36.430 --> 00:39:40.090 align:middle line:84%
she just hauled off and she
kicked her mother so hard,

00:39:40.090 --> 00:39:41.290 align:middle line:90%
and she just ran.

00:39:41.290 --> 00:39:42.780 align:middle line:90%
And I thought, you go, girl.

00:39:42.780 --> 00:39:46.310 align:middle line:84%
What a completely
appropriate response,

00:39:46.310 --> 00:39:49.445 align:middle line:84%
because the little girl was
done with just the stress

00:39:49.445 --> 00:39:50.510 align:middle line:90%
of all that.

00:39:50.510 --> 00:39:53.630 align:middle line:84%
We're stressing our
kids when we give them

00:39:53.630 --> 00:39:57.570 align:middle line:84%
those choices which are based
on social and emotional cause

00:39:57.570 --> 00:39:58.520 align:middle line:90%
and effect.

00:39:58.520 --> 00:40:00.420 align:middle line:90%
They can't go there.

00:40:00.420 --> 00:40:03.000 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Let's talk
about boys specifically.

00:40:03.000 --> 00:40:03.800 align:middle line:90%
This is a big one.

00:40:03.800 --> 00:40:06.880 align:middle line:84%
And again, reflecting
on the Waldorf system.

00:40:06.880 --> 00:40:10.420 align:middle line:84%
I understand it more now,
but oftentimes the boys

00:40:10.420 --> 00:40:13.200 align:middle line:84%
would end up doing two
years of kindergarten

00:40:13.200 --> 00:40:16.540 align:middle line:84%
while the girls would pass on
after one year of kindergarten.

00:40:16.540 --> 00:40:17.850 align:middle line:90%
Why is this?

00:40:17.850 --> 00:40:22.760 align:middle line:84%
What is it that our boys
need that the girls may not?

00:40:22.760 --> 00:40:25.210 align:middle line:84%
>>PAYNE: One of the
things that we've

00:40:25.210 --> 00:40:30.480 align:middle line:84%
noticed over these long years
now of just observing boys

00:40:30.480 --> 00:40:34.580 align:middle line:84%
in contemporary life
is that particularly up

00:40:34.580 --> 00:40:38.250 align:middle line:84%
until about the age of 12,
they just take a little longer

00:40:38.250 --> 00:40:39.580 align:middle line:90%
to process.

00:40:39.580 --> 00:40:40.880 align:middle line:90%
They need to sit with things.

00:40:40.880 --> 00:40:43.580 align:middle line:84%
They need to explore things
a little more practically.

00:40:43.580 --> 00:40:44.680 align:middle line:90%
I'm being general here.

00:40:44.680 --> 00:40:46.115 align:middle line:84%
I don't mean this
only with boys.

00:40:46.115 --> 00:40:48.490 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Yes, and this is a
general question I've asked.

00:40:48.490 --> 00:40:51.250 align:middle line:84%
>>PAYNE: But they
need just that-- one

00:40:51.250 --> 00:40:54.110 align:middle line:84%
of the things boys
really thrive on,

00:40:54.110 --> 00:40:58.250 align:middle line:84%
and this has been said by-- it's
so beautiful to hear this over

00:40:58.250 --> 00:41:02.390 align:middle line:84%
and over from parents-- is
how much better their boys are

00:41:02.390 --> 00:41:05.120 align:middle line:90%
with the simplicity regime.

00:41:05.120 --> 00:41:08.420 align:middle line:84%
They really benefit from it,
because what a lot of boys do,

00:41:08.420 --> 00:41:10.570 align:middle line:90%
they just need more time.

00:41:10.570 --> 00:41:12.310 align:middle line:90%
They need more space.

00:41:12.310 --> 00:41:14.080 align:middle line:90%
Boys want to explore stuff.

00:41:14.080 --> 00:41:16.840 align:middle line:84%
They don't just accept
it because we've said so.

00:41:16.840 --> 00:41:17.977 align:middle line:90%
They want to explore it.

00:41:17.977 --> 00:41:19.060 align:middle line:90%
They want to check it out.

00:41:19.060 --> 00:41:20.770 align:middle line:84%
They want to really
look into it.

00:41:20.770 --> 00:41:22.720 align:middle line:90%
They want to know how it works.

00:41:22.720 --> 00:41:25.070 align:middle line:90%
That all takes time.

00:41:25.070 --> 00:41:27.780 align:middle line:84%
And it's a real concern
for me that our modern,

00:41:27.780 --> 00:41:31.610 align:middle line:84%
fast-paced life is really
disconnecting boys.

00:41:31.610 --> 00:41:35.607 align:middle line:84%
And then the boys turn
to a pseudo-connection

00:41:35.607 --> 00:41:36.190 align:middle line:90%
of technology.

00:41:36.190 --> 00:41:39.570 align:middle line:90%


00:41:39.570 --> 00:41:41.950 align:middle line:84%
Because we're hurrying
them along so much,

00:41:41.950 --> 00:41:47.620 align:middle line:84%
they actually seek in droves
escape routes of technology.

00:41:47.620 --> 00:41:52.310 align:middle line:84%
When we slow it down, a lot of
the kids who are tech-addicted

00:41:52.310 --> 00:41:57.330 align:middle line:84%
or on the edge of being screen
addicted, parents say to me,

00:41:57.330 --> 00:41:58.950 align:middle line:90%
how can I get my kid back?

00:41:58.950 --> 00:42:01.400 align:middle line:84%
How can I get them out
of this virtual world,

00:42:01.400 --> 00:42:03.680 align:middle line:84%
that I virtually don't
exist for them anymore?

00:42:03.680 --> 00:42:05.500 align:middle line:90%
It's this virtual world.

00:42:05.500 --> 00:42:09.130 align:middle line:84%
One of the answers is to
slow down the real world

00:42:09.130 --> 00:42:12.400 align:middle line:84%
so that the boy can actually
feel confident to enter back

00:42:12.400 --> 00:42:13.970 align:middle line:90%
into it.

00:42:13.970 --> 00:42:18.510 align:middle line:84%
Because in the virtual world,
that will work at their pace.

00:42:18.510 --> 00:42:21.220 align:middle line:84%
They can actually be in
control of the pacing

00:42:21.220 --> 00:42:22.710 align:middle line:90%
of those video games.

00:42:22.710 --> 00:42:27.050 align:middle line:84%
The pacing of that is
within a boy's control.

00:42:27.050 --> 00:42:30.120 align:middle line:84%
If the real world
starts to slow down,

00:42:30.120 --> 00:42:33.500 align:middle line:84%
then a boy can feel confident
to enter back into it.

00:42:33.500 --> 00:42:35.860 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And you
say that boys need

00:42:35.860 --> 00:42:38.350 align:middle line:84%
a sense of industry-- I
think the words you used

00:42:38.350 --> 00:42:41.050 align:middle line:90%
were industry and purpose.

00:42:41.050 --> 00:42:42.700 align:middle line:84%
And we'll talk about
girls in a minute,

00:42:42.700 --> 00:42:47.875 align:middle line:84%
but they're not actually
being given the opportunity.

00:42:47.875 --> 00:42:48.500 align:middle line:90%
>>PAYNE: Right.

00:42:48.500 --> 00:42:54.430 align:middle line:84%
And that's where the
countless numbers of parents

00:42:54.430 --> 00:42:59.650 align:middle line:84%
who create a more spaciousness
around their home life, who

00:42:59.650 --> 00:43:03.380 align:middle line:84%
basically push back and
become almost like sentinels,

00:43:03.380 --> 00:43:06.080 align:middle line:84%
they become like
guardians, like gatekeepers

00:43:06.080 --> 00:43:10.230 align:middle line:84%
of how much of the world they're
going to let into their family.

00:43:10.230 --> 00:43:11.950 align:middle line:90%
Because that's our job.

00:43:11.950 --> 00:43:14.280 align:middle line:90%
We're our family's sentinels.

00:43:14.280 --> 00:43:15.540 align:middle line:90%
We stand there.

00:43:15.540 --> 00:43:16.840 align:middle line:90%
Who goes there?

00:43:16.840 --> 00:43:20.900 align:middle line:84%
No, he's not going to do five
nights a week soccer practice.

00:43:20.900 --> 00:43:23.249 align:middle line:90%
He's seven.

00:43:23.249 --> 00:43:24.290 align:middle line:90%
We're not going to do it.

00:43:24.290 --> 00:43:26.540 align:middle line:84%
Well, he won't get
on the travel time.

00:43:26.540 --> 00:43:28.340 align:middle line:90%
Big deal.

00:43:28.340 --> 00:43:34.110 align:middle line:84%
Because over 81% of all kids
who do Little League prior

00:43:34.110 --> 00:43:36.400 align:middle line:84%
to the age of 12 and
get involved in really

00:43:36.400 --> 00:43:40.585 align:middle line:84%
competitive sports drop
out before the age of 16.

00:43:40.585 --> 00:43:42.960 align:middle line:84%
This was a part of our research
for my last book, "Beyond

00:43:42.960 --> 00:43:49.440 align:middle line:84%
Winning," this smart parenting
in a toxic youth sports world.

00:43:49.440 --> 00:43:52.520 align:middle line:84%
We want our kids when they're 16
to be passionate about sports,

00:43:52.520 --> 00:43:55.760 align:middle line:84%
to get really into it, because
there's a lot of other stuff

00:43:55.760 --> 00:43:57.160 align:middle line:90%
we don't want them involved in.

00:43:57.160 --> 00:43:57.390 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:43:57.390 --> 00:43:58.990 align:middle line:84%
And you want that
energy directed

00:43:58.990 --> 00:44:00.170 align:middle line:90%
in a really healthy manner.

00:44:00.170 --> 00:44:03.250 align:middle line:84%
>>PAYNE: But if we push
them too hard too young,

00:44:03.250 --> 00:44:06.870 align:middle line:90%
81% don't go there.

00:44:06.870 --> 00:44:09.420 align:middle line:84%
Less than 20% of kids
go forward with sports

00:44:09.420 --> 00:44:11.160 align:middle line:84%
because they've been
pushed too young.

00:44:11.160 --> 00:44:12.920 align:middle line:84%
Now, that's both
a reality and also

00:44:12.920 --> 00:44:17.430 align:middle line:84%
a metaphor for many other
aspects of life for kids.

00:44:17.430 --> 00:44:19.560 align:middle line:84%
So what I'm suggesting
is that when

00:44:19.560 --> 00:44:23.010 align:middle line:84%
you start to open it
up and slow it down,

00:44:23.010 --> 00:44:27.970 align:middle line:84%
both boys and girls
can enter more into it

00:44:27.970 --> 00:44:31.290 align:middle line:84%
with confidence that
this is good stuff.

00:44:31.290 --> 00:44:34.410 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And boys have
a natural intensity.

00:44:34.410 --> 00:44:37.660 align:middle line:84%
And we'll chastise them
for that sometimes.

00:44:37.660 --> 00:44:41.700 align:middle line:84%
And you're saying this
is the nature of the boy.

00:44:41.700 --> 00:44:42.771 align:middle line:90%
They want to dig down.

00:44:42.771 --> 00:44:45.020 align:middle line:84%
>>PAYNE: Boys generally will
want to dig down into it,

00:44:45.020 --> 00:44:45.820 align:middle line:90%
isn't that right?

00:44:45.820 --> 00:44:46.620 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:44:46.620 --> 00:44:47.650 align:middle line:84%
>>PAYNE: You had
a boy, didn't you,

00:44:47.650 --> 00:44:49.230 align:middle line:84%
and they want to
dig down into it.

00:44:49.230 --> 00:44:51.830 align:middle line:84%
They want to go deeper and
deeper and deeper into it.

00:44:51.830 --> 00:44:53.590 align:middle line:84%
They don't want to
be just lifted up

00:44:53.590 --> 00:44:56.030 align:middle line:84%
after 15 minutes of just
figuring out how to do--

00:44:56.030 --> 00:45:03.260 align:middle line:84%
and then off to soccer practice,
off to music, off to tutoring.

00:45:03.260 --> 00:45:06.660 align:middle line:84%
This is the interesting piece,
because when boys can dig down

00:45:06.660 --> 00:45:09.590 align:middle line:84%
into that kind of thing,
that's their portal

00:45:09.590 --> 00:45:11.300 align:middle line:90%
to understanding themselves.

00:45:11.300 --> 00:45:13.250 align:middle line:90%
That's self-esteem.

00:45:13.250 --> 00:45:14.610 align:middle line:90%
That's who they are.

00:45:14.610 --> 00:45:18.990 align:middle line:84%
That brings them to a
sense of values, of morals.

00:45:18.990 --> 00:45:23.650 align:middle line:84%
That will translate later
into higher kind of values.

00:45:23.650 --> 00:45:27.720 align:middle line:84%
But when they're little, it's
getting to know the world.

00:45:27.720 --> 00:45:31.074 align:middle line:84%
That's the foundation for
the bigger moral stuff.

00:45:31.074 --> 00:45:31.740 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:45:31.740 --> 00:45:34.180 align:middle line:90%
And let's go there.

00:45:34.180 --> 00:45:37.090 align:middle line:84%
What happens in the world
that we've created now,

00:45:37.090 --> 00:45:41.800 align:middle line:84%
with Ritalin and no time to dig
down deep for the boys, when

00:45:41.800 --> 00:45:45.640 align:middle line:84%
it's time for boys and
girls to start interacting?

00:45:45.640 --> 00:45:47.780 align:middle line:84%
>>PAYNE: It's multi-layered,
but one of the things

00:45:47.780 --> 00:45:54.050 align:middle line:84%
that-- I don't want
to be seen as being

00:45:54.050 --> 00:45:57.430 align:middle line:90%
kind of anti any medication.

00:45:57.430 --> 00:45:59.780 align:middle line:84%
Medication for me
is like scaffolding.

00:45:59.780 --> 00:46:04.510 align:middle line:84%
The aim of medication,
if one goes that route,

00:46:04.510 --> 00:46:08.490 align:middle line:84%
is to get to the place that
needs strengthening, to get

00:46:08.490 --> 00:46:13.110 align:middle line:84%
to that scaffolding, to climb
up, secure the structure,

00:46:13.110 --> 00:46:16.240 align:middle line:84%
and then take the
scaffolding away.

00:46:16.240 --> 00:46:18.220 align:middle line:84%
And what secures
a structure more

00:46:18.220 --> 00:46:22.780 align:middle line:84%
than anything else is giving
a child time, and therefore

00:46:22.780 --> 00:46:25.990 align:middle line:84%
connection to you,
to the parent.

00:46:25.990 --> 00:46:30.050 align:middle line:84%
A child who develops a deeper
and deeper sense of base camp,

00:46:30.050 --> 00:46:33.970 align:middle line:84%
my family is my
refuge, that child

00:46:33.970 --> 00:46:37.090 align:middle line:84%
is going to answer that basic
question we spoke about of,

00:46:37.090 --> 00:46:38.950 align:middle line:90%
I feel safe.

00:46:38.950 --> 00:46:40.510 align:middle line:90%
I feel secured.

00:46:40.510 --> 00:46:45.530 align:middle line:84%
I can launch from this place
out into the world and return.

00:46:45.530 --> 00:46:47.280 align:middle line:84%
It's like a little
one of two years old.

00:46:47.280 --> 00:46:49.740 align:middle line:84%
When you put them in a
park, a strange place,

00:46:49.740 --> 00:46:52.180 align:middle line:84%
and you put them down, they
climb up you like a squirrel

00:46:52.180 --> 00:46:54.010 align:middle line:90%
and burrow into you.

00:46:54.010 --> 00:46:56.320 align:middle line:84%
And then they look out and
they'll go a little bit,

00:46:56.320 --> 00:46:57.050 align:middle line:90%
and they'll come back.

00:46:57.050 --> 00:46:58.510 align:middle line:84%
They'll go a little
further and come back.

00:46:58.510 --> 00:47:00.140 align:middle line:84%
And eventually
they'll go right out

00:47:00.140 --> 00:47:02.514 align:middle line:84%
and they'll stand five inches
away from the other child's

00:47:02.514 --> 00:47:04.140 align:middle line:90%
face, staring at each other.

00:47:04.140 --> 00:47:06.070 align:middle line:84%
They'll play for a little
while and come back.

00:47:06.070 --> 00:47:08.360 align:middle line:84%
Now, little children
actually do that.

00:47:08.360 --> 00:47:11.090 align:middle line:84%
But it's the same
thing with teenagers.

00:47:11.090 --> 00:47:13.390 align:middle line:84%
A teenager is like a
newborn, but it's just

00:47:13.390 --> 00:47:16.930 align:middle line:84%
the newborn emotional
world-- just as vulnerable,

00:47:16.930 --> 00:47:20.700 align:middle line:84%
just as vulnerable as the
body of a newborn child,

00:47:20.700 --> 00:47:21.700 align:middle line:90%
of an infant.

00:47:21.700 --> 00:47:25.050 align:middle line:84%
But now it's a newborn
emotional life.

00:47:25.050 --> 00:47:27.070 align:middle line:84%
And they'll go out,
and they'll come back.

00:47:27.070 --> 00:47:28.880 align:middle line:84%
And they'll go out,
and they'll come back.

00:47:28.880 --> 00:47:31.590 align:middle line:84%
But they need a
place to come back

00:47:31.590 --> 00:47:35.840 align:middle line:84%
to that is not fraud,
that is not frenetic.

00:47:35.840 --> 00:47:38.660 align:middle line:84%
And that's what simplicity
and balance does,

00:47:38.660 --> 00:47:41.760 align:middle line:84%
is it gives our older kids,
as well as our younger kids,

00:47:41.760 --> 00:47:45.760 align:middle line:84%
that place of decompression,
that place of safety that they

00:47:45.760 --> 00:47:51.140 align:middle line:84%
can come back to and then
go boldly out into the world

00:47:51.140 --> 00:47:54.430 align:middle line:84%
and really be confident,
because then they can come back.

00:47:54.430 --> 00:47:57.090 align:middle line:84%
And if they get a bump, an
emotional bump or a bruise,

00:47:57.090 --> 00:47:58.950 align:middle line:84%
or a physical bump
or a bruise, they

00:47:58.950 --> 00:48:03.180 align:middle line:84%
know they can come back and
receive us because we're there.

00:48:03.180 --> 00:48:06.430 align:middle line:84%
And I don't mean we're always
home with milk and cookies.

00:48:06.430 --> 00:48:12.050 align:middle line:84%
I mean there there,
available to them.

00:48:12.050 --> 00:48:14.640 align:middle line:90%
There's a connection.

00:48:14.640 --> 00:48:19.110 align:middle line:84%
And for boys and girls,
that's what balancing out

00:48:19.110 --> 00:48:24.010 align:middle line:84%
life and resisting this
kind of scheduling tsunami

00:48:24.010 --> 00:48:26.519 align:middle line:84%
that is coming at
so many families--

00:48:26.519 --> 00:48:28.185 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And the
whole notion-- and you

00:48:28.185 --> 00:48:30.570 align:middle line:84%
said at the very beginning
of the conversation,

00:48:30.570 --> 00:48:34.320 align:middle line:90%
too sexy, too young, too fast.

00:48:34.320 --> 00:48:36.110 align:middle line:90%
How does that impact?

00:48:36.110 --> 00:48:42.590 align:middle line:84%
>>PAYNE: Probably like you,
my grandfather and my father

00:48:42.590 --> 00:48:45.410 align:middle line:84%
were a part of what we call
the Greatest Generation.

00:48:45.410 --> 00:48:48.720 align:middle line:84%
They grew up in the
ashes of the Second World

00:48:48.720 --> 00:48:51.570 align:middle line:90%
War, the economic depression.

00:48:51.570 --> 00:48:53.920 align:middle line:84%
And we call them the
Greatest Generation,

00:48:53.920 --> 00:48:57.970 align:middle line:84%
because they created
so much out of nothing.

00:48:57.970 --> 00:49:00.760 align:middle line:84%
Why is it in modern
times do we think

00:49:00.760 --> 00:49:03.220 align:middle line:84%
that giving our children
everything will make them

00:49:03.220 --> 00:49:05.390 align:middle line:90%
great?

00:49:05.390 --> 00:49:10.640 align:middle line:84%
We need to also have them be
able to take hold of the world

00:49:10.640 --> 00:49:14.280 align:middle line:84%
without all this
super structured life.

00:49:14.280 --> 00:49:19.160 align:middle line:84%
One of the figures that
really is very interesting

00:49:19.160 --> 00:49:23.410 align:middle line:84%
is that 53 million adults
in the United States

00:49:23.410 --> 00:49:25.510 align:middle line:90%
now are freelance.

00:49:25.510 --> 00:49:33.030 align:middle line:84%
38% of all millennials,
adults under the age of 35,

00:49:33.030 --> 00:49:35.280 align:middle line:90%
freelance, a full 38%.

00:49:35.280 --> 00:49:39.620 align:middle line:84%
And by 2025, doing the
math, it'll be over 50%.

00:49:39.620 --> 00:49:42.860 align:middle line:84%
Over 50% of people
will be freelance.

00:49:42.860 --> 00:49:45.700 align:middle line:84%
Millennials are putting
together what I think

00:49:45.700 --> 00:49:47.860 align:middle line:90%
of as tapestry employment.

00:49:47.860 --> 00:49:51.300 align:middle line:84%
They're putting together a weave
of employment-- this and then

00:49:51.300 --> 00:49:52.610 align:middle line:90%
this and then that.

00:49:52.610 --> 00:49:55.717 align:middle line:84%
The jobs for life have
gone, for the most part,

00:49:55.717 --> 00:49:56.550 align:middle line:90%
or are disappearing.

00:49:56.550 --> 00:49:57.840 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: To work in a
factory for 30 years,

00:49:57.840 --> 00:49:58.390 align:middle line:90%
get your watch in retirement.

00:49:58.390 --> 00:49:59.806 align:middle line:84%
>>PAYNE: Or work
in a law practice

00:49:59.806 --> 00:50:02.320 align:middle line:84%
or work in
construction, whatever.

00:50:02.320 --> 00:50:04.280 align:middle line:84%
That's our grandfather
and father's time.

00:50:04.280 --> 00:50:06.490 align:middle line:84%
For some people it
might, with benefits

00:50:06.490 --> 00:50:08.010 align:middle line:90%
and all this sort of stuff.

00:50:08.010 --> 00:50:09.575 align:middle line:84%
Now, the reason
I'm mentioning this

00:50:09.575 --> 00:50:13.800 align:middle line:84%
is so many parents are
still putting their kids

00:50:13.800 --> 00:50:18.840 align:middle line:84%
in these super scheduled, like
every single day is scheduled

00:50:18.840 --> 00:50:22.340 align:middle line:84%
to within an inch
of the child's life.

00:50:22.340 --> 00:50:24.360 align:middle line:84%
And so the child is
learning to exist

00:50:24.360 --> 00:50:27.660 align:middle line:84%
within this tight
super scheduled world.

00:50:27.660 --> 00:50:31.300 align:middle line:84%
Then they graduate, and
they go into the work force,

00:50:31.300 --> 00:50:35.090 align:middle line:84%
and that super scheduled
world is all they know.

00:50:35.090 --> 00:50:36.555 align:middle line:90%
And it doesn't exist.

00:50:36.555 --> 00:50:37.680 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: It doesn't exist.

00:50:37.680 --> 00:50:40.160 align:middle line:84%
And this whole No Child
Left Behind, which

00:50:40.160 --> 00:50:41.347 align:middle line:90%
you have another name for--

00:50:41.347 --> 00:50:43.180 align:middle line:84%
>>PAYNE: I call it the
No Child Left Intact.

00:50:43.180 --> 00:50:44.513 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: I couldn't agree more.

00:50:44.513 --> 00:50:48.240 align:middle line:84%
And that whole failure
of teaching to the test

00:50:48.240 --> 00:50:52.450 align:middle line:84%
so you can essentially make
a monochromatic worker bee

00:50:52.450 --> 00:50:53.580 align:middle line:90%
species, more or less.

00:50:53.580 --> 00:50:54.925 align:middle line:90%
There's no texture.

00:50:54.925 --> 00:50:55.550 align:middle line:90%
>>PAYNE: Right.

00:50:55.550 --> 00:50:59.570 align:middle line:84%
Well, one of the things
that-- just dialing it

00:50:59.570 --> 00:51:01.570 align:middle line:84%
back and balancing
out a kid's life,

00:51:01.570 --> 00:51:04.550 align:middle line:84%
is that when you give them
space and you give them time,

00:51:04.550 --> 00:51:06.200 align:middle line:90%
they do very crucial thing.

00:51:06.200 --> 00:51:11.240 align:middle line:84%
Study after study has shown
that this amazing developmental

00:51:11.240 --> 00:51:14.070 align:middle line:84%
piece around play,
around free play,

00:51:14.070 --> 00:51:17.590 align:middle line:84%
they learn to be creative,
innovative, and adaptable.

00:51:17.590 --> 00:51:22.410 align:middle line:84%
Now, President Obama, in one of
the states of the nation speech

00:51:22.410 --> 00:51:26.160 align:middle line:84%
mentioned that we must create
this innovation economy.

00:51:26.160 --> 00:51:27.400 align:middle line:90%
It's very, very interesting.

00:51:27.400 --> 00:51:28.566 align:middle line:90%
He mentioned it three times.

00:51:28.566 --> 00:51:31.880 align:middle line:84%
It's very, very interesting,
innovation economy,

00:51:31.880 --> 00:51:32.929 align:middle line:90%
because it just is.

00:51:32.929 --> 00:51:35.220 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Then they need to
scrap the current education

00:51:35.220 --> 00:51:35.720 align:middle line:90%
system.

00:51:35.720 --> 00:51:38.170 align:middle line:84%
>>PAYNE: Well, you see, if
you give our kids space--

00:51:38.170 --> 00:51:41.430 align:middle line:84%
you see, so much of
the education system,

00:51:41.430 --> 00:51:44.120 align:middle line:84%
we've got big concerns
about it, but it's

00:51:44.120 --> 00:51:46.410 align:middle line:90%
kind of outside our control.

00:51:46.410 --> 00:51:50.380 align:middle line:84%
But what's within our
control is our home life.

00:51:50.380 --> 00:51:55.140 align:middle line:84%
And within our sphere of
influence is our home life.

00:51:55.140 --> 00:51:59.220 align:middle line:84%
If we give our kids time to
creatively play, to innovate,

00:51:59.220 --> 00:52:02.430 align:middle line:84%
to problem solve,
they literally develop

00:52:02.430 --> 00:52:04.450 align:middle line:84%
parts of their emotional
being, of their brain,

00:52:04.450 --> 00:52:06.260 align:middle line:90%
of their emotional being.

00:52:06.260 --> 00:52:10.030 align:middle line:84%
So simplifying and balancing is
preparing kids for the future.

00:52:10.030 --> 00:52:12.390 align:middle line:84%
It's not going back to
"Little House on the Prairie."

00:52:12.390 --> 00:52:14.740 align:middle line:84%
It's not wishing
to go back in time.

00:52:14.740 --> 00:52:18.050 align:middle line:84%
It's actually preparing
kids for the future.

00:52:18.050 --> 00:52:20.140 align:middle line:84%
And look, you only have
to do it a little bit,

00:52:20.140 --> 00:52:22.820 align:middle line:84%
honestly, because the
passing grade is fairly low,

00:52:22.820 --> 00:52:23.820 align:middle line:90%
do you know what I mean?

00:52:23.820 --> 00:52:26.990 align:middle line:84%
There's a lot of real wacko
behavior going on out there.

00:52:26.990 --> 00:52:29.890 align:middle line:84%
We only have to simplify
and balance a little bit

00:52:29.890 --> 00:52:31.470 align:middle line:90%
to have a superstar kid.

00:52:31.470 --> 00:52:32.720 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:52:32.720 --> 00:52:37.090 align:middle line:84%
And each one of us, every human
being, has their own destiny.

00:52:37.090 --> 00:52:39.910 align:middle line:84%
Let's talk about
how given the space,

00:52:39.910 --> 00:52:41.474 align:middle line:84%
children will reveal
their destiny,

00:52:41.474 --> 00:52:43.640 align:middle line:84%
kind of like the beginning
part of our conversation.

00:52:43.640 --> 00:52:44.223 align:middle line:90%
>>PAYNE: Yeah.

00:52:44.223 --> 00:52:46.620 align:middle line:84%
Aristotle called that
telos, by the way.

00:52:46.620 --> 00:52:47.540 align:middle line:90%
Telos.

00:52:47.540 --> 00:52:47.900 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Aristotle, yes.

00:52:47.900 --> 00:52:50.390 align:middle line:84%
>>PAYNE: Yeah, that each child
would come into the world

00:52:50.390 --> 00:52:52.890 align:middle line:84%
with a telos, with
a spirit seed,

00:52:52.890 --> 00:52:56.360 align:middle line:84%
with something that they
come to bring to this world.

00:52:56.360 --> 00:52:57.800 align:middle line:90%
Amazing concept.

00:52:57.800 --> 00:53:04.530 align:middle line:84%
And earlier on, we spoke
about this disorder and quirk

00:53:04.530 --> 00:53:08.450 align:middle line:84%
as a spectrum, that
kids can get on this--

00:53:08.450 --> 00:53:11.640 align:middle line:84%
they can be really
troubled, you dial it back,

00:53:11.640 --> 00:53:14.050 align:middle line:84%
you simplify, and
they become quirky.

00:53:14.050 --> 00:53:18.780 align:middle line:84%
But what's at the other end of
that spectrum is their genius.

00:53:18.780 --> 00:53:22.910 align:middle line:84%
The very thing that's
their so-called disorder,

00:53:22.910 --> 00:53:27.550 align:middle line:84%
if they have a simple and
balanced life, is their genius.

00:53:27.550 --> 00:53:28.760 align:middle line:90%
But it's the same.

00:53:28.760 --> 00:53:32.720 align:middle line:84%
And what's beautiful about it
is that the choices is ours.

00:53:32.720 --> 00:53:35.930 align:middle line:84%
If we create space
within their lives,

00:53:35.930 --> 00:53:41.300 align:middle line:84%
their genius, their gift,
their telos, their spirit seed,

00:53:41.300 --> 00:53:44.490 align:middle line:90%
can put down roots.

00:53:44.490 --> 00:53:47.425 align:middle line:84%
If we surround them in a
fever pitch and a tsunami

00:53:47.425 --> 00:53:51.490 align:middle line:84%
of too much too soon,
that spirit seed

00:53:51.490 --> 00:53:54.180 align:middle line:84%
is sitting there just
waiting, waiting.

00:53:54.180 --> 00:53:55.700 align:middle line:90%
Now, is it too late?

00:53:55.700 --> 00:53:56.890 align:middle line:90%
Does it shrivel up and die?

00:53:56.890 --> 00:53:57.390 align:middle line:90%
No, no, no.

00:53:57.390 --> 00:53:58.140 align:middle line:90%
It's very patient.

00:53:58.140 --> 00:54:00.685 align:middle line:90%
Telos is patient.

00:54:00.685 --> 00:54:03.099 align:middle line:84%
We can do this at 14,
15, 16 years of age.

00:54:03.099 --> 00:54:04.640 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: We can do
this at 40 or 50.

00:54:04.640 --> 00:54:05.390 align:middle line:90%
>>PAYNE: Can't we?

00:54:05.390 --> 00:54:07.280 align:middle line:90%
Yes, exactly.

00:54:07.280 --> 00:54:10.340 align:middle line:90%
It just waits very patiently.

00:54:10.340 --> 00:54:13.990 align:middle line:84%
And then down it--
and as parents,

00:54:13.990 --> 00:54:17.490 align:middle line:84%
what's so beautiful
is that we're actually

00:54:17.490 --> 00:54:20.740 align:middle line:84%
in full control of
that within our homes,

00:54:20.740 --> 00:54:22.570 align:middle line:84%
because at the
beginning of our talk,

00:54:22.570 --> 00:54:26.430 align:middle line:84%
I mentioned this really
difficult image of we're

00:54:26.430 --> 00:54:28.890 align:middle line:84%
living in the undeclared
war on childhood.

00:54:28.890 --> 00:54:30.030 align:middle line:90%
That's a dark image.

00:54:30.030 --> 00:54:31.510 align:middle line:90%
And we've got war around us.

00:54:31.510 --> 00:54:34.800 align:middle line:84%
What can we do about these
wars raging in the world?

00:54:34.800 --> 00:54:38.490 align:middle line:84%
But in the undeclared
war on childhood,

00:54:38.490 --> 00:54:40.780 align:middle line:84%
we can declare
peace in our homes.

00:54:40.780 --> 00:54:43.090 align:middle line:90%
We can be incredibly effective.

00:54:43.090 --> 00:54:45.340 align:middle line:90%
No one can stop us doing that.

00:54:45.340 --> 00:54:51.000 align:middle line:84%
We can do that and have our
children have a childhood.

00:54:51.000 --> 00:54:52.740 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: You have a
new book coming out.

00:54:52.740 --> 00:54:55.490 align:middle line:84%
>>PAYNE: Yeah, "Soul
of Discipline."

00:54:55.490 --> 00:54:59.280 align:middle line:84%
I've never met a disobedient
child in all my life.

00:54:59.280 --> 00:55:00.780 align:middle line:90%
And I've met some rascals.

00:55:00.780 --> 00:55:02.820 align:middle line:90%
I'm a counselor, right?

00:55:02.820 --> 00:55:04.340 align:middle line:90%
I don't believe in disobedience.

00:55:04.340 --> 00:55:06.660 align:middle line:90%
It's disorientation.

00:55:06.660 --> 00:55:08.840 align:middle line:84%
And what I'm really
talking about

00:55:08.840 --> 00:55:11.740 align:middle line:84%
is that how do we
orient our children?

00:55:11.740 --> 00:55:18.550 align:middle line:84%
How do we have discipline that
is both warm, firm, and calm?

00:55:18.550 --> 00:55:21.120 align:middle line:84%
And so in the "Soul
of Discipline" book,

00:55:21.120 --> 00:55:26.057 align:middle line:84%
I've really tried to talk about
the three developmental stages

00:55:26.057 --> 00:55:28.140 align:middle line:84%
that kids go through-- up
to about seven or eight,

00:55:28.140 --> 00:55:31.320 align:middle line:84%
then in their tween years,
and then their teen years.

00:55:31.320 --> 00:55:35.340 align:middle line:10%
And how can we shift
our discipline focus

00:55:35.340 --> 00:55:39.910 align:middle line:10%
to have kids recognize
that we're moving with them

00:55:39.910 --> 00:55:44.180 align:middle line:10%
and that our
understanding of where

00:55:44.180 --> 00:55:47.720 align:middle line:10%
they're up to in their
lives is being recognized.

00:55:47.720 --> 00:55:52.010 align:middle line:84%
So the "Soul of Discipline"
book is very much a companion

00:55:52.010 --> 00:55:54.410 align:middle line:84%
to the "Simplicity Parenting,"
very similarly themed.

00:55:54.410 --> 00:55:54.993 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:55:54.993 --> 00:55:57.470 align:middle line:84%
And you're attracting
attention all over.

00:55:57.470 --> 00:56:00.260 align:middle line:84%
There may be a documentary,
HBO, coming out

00:56:00.260 --> 00:56:03.970 align:middle line:84%
on "Simplicity Parenting" and
following into the cultures

00:56:03.970 --> 00:56:06.900 align:middle line:84%
you visited all those years
ago forward, the effect

00:56:06.900 --> 00:56:10.490 align:middle line:84%
of our behavior in the world
we've created on our children

00:56:10.490 --> 00:56:11.827 align:middle line:90%
and how we can reverse that.

00:56:11.827 --> 00:56:12.410 align:middle line:90%
>>PAYNE: Yeah.

00:56:12.410 --> 00:56:14.390 align:middle line:84%
This movement has just--
it's gone from being

00:56:14.390 --> 00:56:16.090 align:middle line:90%
a movement to a community.

00:56:16.090 --> 00:56:18.470 align:middle line:90%
It's really interesting.

00:56:18.470 --> 00:56:22.327 align:middle line:84%
It's actually moved
into that dimension now.

00:56:22.327 --> 00:56:23.160 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Thank you.

00:56:23.160 --> 00:56:24.906 align:middle line:84%
I'm so glad we
finally connected.

00:56:24.906 --> 00:56:26.530 align:middle line:84%
It was a little bit
to get us together,

00:56:26.530 --> 00:56:29.194 align:middle line:84%
and I'd love to have you back,
after the new book is out

00:56:29.194 --> 00:56:31.610 align:middle line:84%
and when you're in the midst
of-- because we didn't really

00:56:31.610 --> 00:56:33.490 align:middle line:90%
get into that subject today.

00:56:33.490 --> 00:56:36.220 align:middle line:84%
And anyway, I know
your schedule,

00:56:36.220 --> 00:56:38.050 align:middle line:84%
you're highly in
demand right now.

00:56:38.050 --> 00:56:39.446 align:middle line:84%
So thank you for
taking the time.

00:56:39.446 --> 00:56:41.070 align:middle line:84%
>>PAYNE: Oh, it's an
absolute pleasure.

00:56:41.070 --> 00:56:42.640 align:middle line:90%
Thank you.

00:56:42.640 --> 00:56:44.390 align:middle line:10%
>>REGINA: I consider
this book a must

00:56:44.390 --> 00:56:47.590 align:middle line:10%
read for parents and parents
to be, even grandparents.

00:56:47.590 --> 00:56:50.310 align:middle line:84%
Having personally seen the
results of this kind of child

00:56:50.310 --> 00:56:53.860 align:middle line:84%
rearing, "Simplicity Parenting"
cannot be recommended highly

00:56:53.860 --> 00:56:54.470 align:middle line:90%
enough.

00:56:54.470 --> 00:56:56.640 align:middle line:84%
You can find it through
all major booksellers.

00:56:56.640 --> 00:57:00.720 align:middle line:84%
Until next time, thank you for
joining us here on Gaiam TV.
