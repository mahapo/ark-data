00:00:04.401 --> 00:00:07.335 align:middle line:90%
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:00:07.335 --> 00:00:19.630 align:middle line:90%


00:00:19.630 --> 00:00:21.880 align:middle line:10%
>>REGINA MEREDITH: There is
not a more eloquent person

00:00:21.880 --> 00:00:24.970 align:middle line:10%
I know when it comes to sharing
spiritual wisdom than Raymond

00:00:24.970 --> 00:00:27.395 align:middle line:10%
Tarpley, a true American shaman.

00:00:27.395 --> 00:00:29.020 align:middle line:10%
He has been a favorite
with our viewers

00:00:29.020 --> 00:00:31.690 align:middle line:10%
because he brings a level of
truth and refinement seldom

00:00:31.690 --> 00:00:33.117 align:middle line:10%
seen in today's world.

00:00:33.117 --> 00:00:35.200 align:middle line:84%
And today, we're going to
speak about many things,

00:00:35.200 --> 00:00:39.430 align:middle line:84%
including the need to call
forth our real self and eschew

00:00:39.430 --> 00:00:40.690 align:middle line:90%
institutions.

00:00:40.690 --> 00:00:43.170 align:middle line:84%
And that's how this
one got my attention.

00:00:43.170 --> 00:00:44.050 align:middle line:90%
Yay.

00:00:44.050 --> 00:00:46.415 align:middle line:84%
Let's bring them down,
burn the house down.

00:00:46.415 --> 00:00:47.290 align:middle line:90%
I shouldn't say that.

00:00:47.290 --> 00:00:48.665 align:middle line:84%
I know I'm a bit
of an anarchist.

00:00:48.665 --> 00:00:49.923 align:middle line:90%
But welcome again, Raymond.

00:00:49.923 --> 00:00:51.340 align:middle line:84%
>>RAYMOND TARPEY:
Thank you, Gina.

00:00:51.340 --> 00:00:52.897 align:middle line:84%
What a pleasure to
be with you again.

00:00:52.897 --> 00:00:53.980 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: And here we are.

00:00:53.980 --> 00:00:55.540 align:middle line:90%
And this day is the 19th--

00:00:55.540 --> 00:00:59.090 align:middle line:84%
recording on the 19th,
and this is a special day.

00:00:59.090 --> 00:00:59.890 align:middle line:90%
>>TARPEY: Yes.

00:00:59.890 --> 00:01:02.380 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Tell us about the
19th and the significance.

00:01:02.380 --> 00:01:06.220 align:middle line:10%
>>TARPEY: Well, the two sacred
numbers of the Mayan calendar

00:01:06.220 --> 00:01:09.910 align:middle line:10%
are 13 and 20.

00:01:09.910 --> 00:01:14.290 align:middle line:84%
13 became the standard
of the United States

00:01:14.290 --> 00:01:19.180 align:middle line:84%
because by happenstance, they
wound up with 13 colonies,

00:01:19.180 --> 00:01:21.860 align:middle line:84%
and I think they
really wanted 12.

00:01:21.860 --> 00:01:22.660 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: OK.

00:01:22.660 --> 00:01:26.230 align:middle line:90%
>>TARPEY: And then the 19--

00:01:26.230 --> 00:01:30.910 align:middle line:84%
the other number, 20 20 is
the flowering of the shaman.

00:01:30.910 --> 00:01:32.500 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: How does
19 factor in here?

00:01:32.500 --> 00:01:34.520 align:middle line:84%
>>TARPEY: The 19
is the apprentice.

00:01:34.520 --> 00:01:36.448 align:middle line:84%
So I still consider
myself an apprentice.

00:01:36.448 --> 00:01:37.990 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Oh, I was
thinking, no, I'm

00:01:37.990 --> 00:01:40.440 align:middle line:84%
the apprentice
sitting at your feet.

00:01:40.440 --> 00:01:42.820 align:middle line:84%
>>TARPEY: We are all
apprentices, I think.

00:01:42.820 --> 00:01:46.430 align:middle line:84%
And there are so many
levels of shamanship,

00:01:46.430 --> 00:01:53.140 align:middle line:84%
because we are coming again
and again into the world,

00:01:53.140 --> 00:01:55.990 align:middle line:84%
and we have to rise
to the level where

00:01:55.990 --> 00:01:58.960 align:middle line:84%
we're going to be
able to establish

00:01:58.960 --> 00:02:03.670 align:middle line:84%
peace and justice on every
square inch of this planet.

00:02:03.670 --> 00:02:05.705 align:middle line:90%
That's the job.

00:02:05.705 --> 00:02:07.330 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: That's a
tall task, and we're

00:02:07.330 --> 00:02:08.800 align:middle line:84%
going to get into
what it's going

00:02:08.800 --> 00:02:11.500 align:middle line:84%
to take to get there as we
continue in the conversation.

00:02:11.500 --> 00:02:15.220 align:middle line:84%
But first, the elephant in the
room is actually the crystal

00:02:15.220 --> 00:02:18.490 align:middle line:84%
skull in the room we cannot
go without mentioning.

00:02:18.490 --> 00:02:19.545 align:middle line:90%
His name is Earth Keeper.

00:02:19.545 --> 00:02:20.503 align:middle line:90%
>>TARPEY: Earth Keeper.

00:02:20.503 --> 00:02:23.350 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And we're going
to talk about Earth Keeper's

00:02:23.350 --> 00:02:26.380 align:middle line:84%
presence in your life and
how that happened, but also,

00:02:26.380 --> 00:02:28.770 align:middle line:84%
he's just-- the energy
is blasting off of him,

00:02:28.770 --> 00:02:31.190 align:middle line:84%
so I'm just trying
to stay conscious,

00:02:31.190 --> 00:02:33.220 align:middle line:90%
alert in his presence.

00:02:33.220 --> 00:02:36.200 align:middle line:84%
So tell us a little
bit about Earth Keeper.

00:02:36.200 --> 00:02:37.450 align:middle line:90%
>>TARPEY: Well, Earth Keeper--

00:02:37.450 --> 00:02:38.520 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Who he is,
where he came from,

00:02:38.520 --> 00:02:39.478 align:middle line:90%
and how he came to you.

00:02:39.478 --> 00:02:43.390 align:middle line:84%
>>TARPEY: Well, Earth Keeper
is made of agate crystal,

00:02:43.390 --> 00:02:47.110 align:middle line:84%
and Earth Keeper was
presented to me by two people,

00:02:47.110 --> 00:02:51.340 align:middle line:84%
one man from Germany,
the other lady from Peru.

00:02:51.340 --> 00:02:56.740 align:middle line:10%
So one European, one
American, so to speak,

00:02:56.740 --> 00:02:58.860 align:middle line:10%
born in the Americas.

00:02:58.860 --> 00:03:05.450 align:middle line:84%
And while I was lecturing, they
said, he wants to be with you.

00:03:05.450 --> 00:03:06.870 align:middle line:90%
And so they put--

00:03:06.870 --> 00:03:08.650 align:middle line:90%
I had them put them on the--

00:03:08.650 --> 00:03:11.680 align:middle line:84%
put him on the table
where I was speaking,

00:03:11.680 --> 00:03:15.010 align:middle line:84%
and then they came back later
on at 4 o'clock and said,

00:03:15.010 --> 00:03:16.600 align:middle line:90%
he still wants to be with you.

00:03:16.600 --> 00:03:19.030 align:middle line:90%
Would you become his caretaker?

00:03:19.030 --> 00:03:20.576 align:middle line:90%
And I said, uh, uh.

00:03:20.576 --> 00:03:26.950 align:middle line:84%
[LAUGHS] It was one of the most
amazing moments of my life.

00:03:26.950 --> 00:03:28.180 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: And this happened--

00:03:28.180 --> 00:03:29.520 align:middle line:90%
because that's when I met you.

00:03:29.520 --> 00:03:31.190 align:middle line:90%
I may have met you that day.

00:03:31.190 --> 00:03:32.080 align:middle line:90%
>>TARPEY: Yes, yes.

00:03:32.080 --> 00:03:34.080 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Either that day
or the following day's

00:03:34.080 --> 00:03:34.880 align:middle line:90%
when we first met.

00:03:34.880 --> 00:03:36.255 align:middle line:90%
>>TARPEY: 11-11-11.

00:03:36.255 --> 00:03:36.460 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

00:03:36.460 --> 00:03:37.660 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: I was at
that conference.

00:03:37.660 --> 00:03:39.140 align:middle line:84%
>>TARPEY: And here
we are 11 again.

00:03:39.140 --> 00:03:41.390 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And I remember you
were, as the British say,

00:03:41.390 --> 00:03:43.340 align:middle line:84%
gobsmacked that
this had happened,

00:03:43.340 --> 00:03:46.310 align:middle line:84%
and I met you right after
you were given Earth Keeper.

00:03:46.310 --> 00:03:47.110 align:middle line:90%
>>TARPEY: Yep.

00:03:47.110 --> 00:03:49.720 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And you had no idea
what would commence after that.

00:03:49.720 --> 00:03:50.520 align:middle line:90%
>>TARPEY: No.

00:03:50.520 --> 00:03:51.730 align:middle line:90%
I had no idea.

00:03:51.730 --> 00:03:55.690 align:middle line:84%
I was using the
Mayan calendar, and I

00:03:55.690 --> 00:04:01.030 align:middle line:84%
was talking about what I had
learned from Mayan history

00:04:01.030 --> 00:04:05.110 align:middle line:84%
and from the Popol Vuh,
one of the main sources

00:04:05.110 --> 00:04:12.340 align:middle line:84%
of the Mayan testimony, spirit
testimony of a culture that

00:04:12.340 --> 00:04:15.790 align:middle line:84%
existed at the crossroads
between Atlantis

00:04:15.790 --> 00:04:19.029 align:middle line:84%
and Mu Lemuria
and the thin place

00:04:19.029 --> 00:04:22.360 align:middle line:84%
in between the two big
pieces of the Americas.

00:04:22.360 --> 00:04:25.570 align:middle line:84%
And so it's sort of
by their very position

00:04:25.570 --> 00:04:31.000 align:middle line:84%
they're appointed to have a
special place in our spirit

00:04:31.000 --> 00:04:32.560 align:middle line:90%
heritage.

00:04:32.560 --> 00:04:36.760 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Now, was he
one of the 12 skulls

00:04:36.760 --> 00:04:38.860 align:middle line:84%
that had been
identified at that time

00:04:38.860 --> 00:04:42.250 align:middle line:84%
that the elders from mostly
central and South America

00:04:42.250 --> 00:04:44.420 align:middle line:84%
possessed, and a
couple of Americans?

00:04:44.420 --> 00:04:49.000 align:middle line:84%
>>TARPEY: It is a
legend of the 13 skulls

00:04:49.000 --> 00:04:51.100 align:middle line:90%
when they come together.

00:04:51.100 --> 00:04:57.100 align:middle line:84%
And 13 is-- the meaning of
13 is mainly transformation,

00:04:57.100 --> 00:04:58.440 align:middle line:90%
to transform.

00:04:58.440 --> 00:05:01.210 align:middle line:90%
And the number 13 is sacred.

00:05:01.210 --> 00:05:05.200 align:middle line:84%
The Maya seem to have
seen it because they

00:05:05.200 --> 00:05:10.060 align:middle line:84%
looked at the human body and saw
13 joints, three in each arm,

00:05:10.060 --> 00:05:12.850 align:middle line:90%
three in each leg, and the neck.

00:05:12.850 --> 00:05:16.660 align:middle line:84%
And they saw it in the
growth patterns of plants,

00:05:16.660 --> 00:05:21.590 align:middle line:84%
where you'd have five
revolutions and eight leaves.

00:05:21.590 --> 00:05:23.210 align:middle line:90%
Most plants grow in that way.

00:05:23.210 --> 00:05:25.030 align:middle line:90%
That's the Fibonacci sequence.

00:05:25.030 --> 00:05:27.030 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So to them, 13
became a sacred number.

00:05:27.030 --> 00:05:28.488 align:middle line:84%
>>TARPEY: It became
a sacred number

00:05:28.488 --> 00:05:30.500 align:middle line:84%
because they're
observing nature.

00:05:30.500 --> 00:05:35.120 align:middle line:84%
It's not just observing the
sky for their astrology.

00:05:35.120 --> 00:05:39.620 align:middle line:84%
All of nature is their
astrology, so it's natureology.

00:05:39.620 --> 00:05:43.610 align:middle line:84%
And so everything is
equal in the Mayan world.

00:05:43.610 --> 00:05:49.110 align:middle line:84%
We are not above a rock, or
a plant, or a piece of earth,

00:05:49.110 --> 00:05:49.910 align:middle line:90%
or a stone.

00:05:49.910 --> 00:05:52.100 align:middle line:90%
We are the same.

00:05:52.100 --> 00:05:56.540 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And speaking of stone,
going back to Earth Keeper,

00:05:56.540 --> 00:06:00.320 align:middle line:84%
there are other-- other elders
had brought their skulls in too

00:06:00.320 --> 00:06:02.490 align:middle line:84%
in 2011, and I
met a few of them.

00:06:02.490 --> 00:06:04.550 align:middle line:84%
And each one has a
very different energy

00:06:04.550 --> 00:06:07.130 align:middle line:84%
and characteristic, and
I would assume, purpose.

00:06:07.130 --> 00:06:12.530 align:middle line:84%
And what is the belief
or understanding

00:06:12.530 --> 00:06:15.750 align:middle line:84%
regarding the origins
of where they came from,

00:06:15.750 --> 00:06:18.557 align:middle line:84%
who carved them, what
part of the world

00:06:18.557 --> 00:06:20.390 align:middle line:84%
they were originally
found in, and so forth?

00:06:20.390 --> 00:06:22.490 align:middle line:84%
>>TARPEY: Oh, the physical--
the physical crystal?

00:06:22.490 --> 00:06:24.073 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: The physical
aspect of them,

00:06:24.073 --> 00:06:26.720 align:middle line:84%
and then how that became
conjoined with conscious.

00:06:26.720 --> 00:06:27.680 align:middle line:90%
>>TARPEY: Yes.

00:06:27.680 --> 00:06:34.790 align:middle line:84%
There have been some crystal
skulls found in the Americas,

00:06:34.790 --> 00:06:40.590 align:middle line:84%
in the Aztec lands and Mayan
lands especially, but not--

00:06:40.590 --> 00:06:44.450 align:middle line:84%
they're found by people who are
looking in different places,

00:06:44.450 --> 00:06:48.140 align:middle line:84%
and some of them cannot be
announced because it would be

00:06:48.140 --> 00:06:49.770 align:middle line:90%
repossessed, so I'm not sure.

00:06:49.770 --> 00:06:50.570 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: OK.

00:06:50.570 --> 00:06:53.690 align:middle line:84%
>>TARPEY: There are a lot of
stories and a lot of legends.

00:06:53.690 --> 00:06:58.790 align:middle line:84%
And the important thing is
to treat them all the same,

00:06:58.790 --> 00:07:03.080 align:middle line:84%
because their skull
intended for the person--

00:07:03.080 --> 00:07:05.870 align:middle line:84%
there is a way
that you can draw--

00:07:05.870 --> 00:07:08.270 align:middle line:84%
a person can draw
that skull to them.

00:07:08.270 --> 00:07:10.880 align:middle line:90%


00:07:10.880 --> 00:07:16.460 align:middle line:84%
And for me, it was quite
a shock because I was not

00:07:16.460 --> 00:07:21.288 align:middle line:84%
into crystal skulls when I
began at ARE in Virginia Beach.

00:07:21.288 --> 00:07:23.080 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Which is
Edgar Cayce's institute.

00:07:23.080 --> 00:07:25.640 align:middle line:90%
>>TARPEY: Edgar Cayce's ARE.

00:07:25.640 --> 00:07:30.330 align:middle line:84%
And I did a presentation in
New York on the crystal skull.

00:07:30.330 --> 00:07:34.130 align:middle line:84%
And there were a few people
in the room because--

00:07:34.130 --> 00:07:35.720 align:middle line:84%
but then when they
heard the story

00:07:35.720 --> 00:07:38.480 align:middle line:84%
of the legend of
the crystal skull,

00:07:38.480 --> 00:07:40.520 align:middle line:84%
then the room
suddenly filled up.

00:07:40.520 --> 00:07:42.320 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Well, people
are so fascinated.

00:07:42.320 --> 00:07:44.120 align:middle line:84%
I mean, Hollywood did
their version of it.

00:07:44.120 --> 00:07:44.430 align:middle line:90%
>>TARPEY: Oh, yes.

00:07:44.430 --> 00:07:45.800 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Wasn't one of
the "Raiders of the Lost

00:07:45.800 --> 00:07:47.280 align:middle line:90%
Ark" the crystal skulls?

00:07:47.280 --> 00:07:49.035 align:middle line:90%
They had 13 skulls there.

00:07:49.035 --> 00:07:49.310 align:middle line:84%
>>TARPEY: They didn't
really cover that.

00:07:49.310 --> 00:07:50.080 align:middle line:90%
They didn't cover the--

00:07:50.080 --> 00:07:51.800 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: They didn't cover
it, just that they were there,

00:07:51.800 --> 00:07:54.217 align:middle line:84%
and that was the holy grail
of what they were looking for,

00:07:54.217 --> 00:07:57.350 align:middle line:84%
these wisdom keepers
from ancient times.

00:07:57.350 --> 00:07:59.750 align:middle line:84%
>>TARPEY: And everybody takes
in at a different place.

00:07:59.750 --> 00:08:00.830 align:middle line:90%
It's fine.

00:08:00.830 --> 00:08:03.170 align:middle line:84%
It all contributes to the
general knowledge of us

00:08:03.170 --> 00:08:05.550 align:middle line:90%
all to know our legends.

00:08:05.550 --> 00:08:06.350 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:08:06.350 --> 00:08:09.260 align:middle line:84%
And the interesting
thing about these skulls,

00:08:09.260 --> 00:08:11.390 align:middle line:84%
because they are
also human or ET,

00:08:11.390 --> 00:08:13.380 align:middle line:84%
whatever, representation
of a human skull--

00:08:13.380 --> 00:08:14.180 align:middle line:90%
>>TARPEY: Yes.

00:08:14.180 --> 00:08:17.500 align:middle line:90%


00:08:17.500 --> 00:08:19.370 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: --I think--
you said they're

00:08:19.370 --> 00:08:20.470 align:middle line:90%
all to be treated equal.

00:08:20.470 --> 00:08:21.270 align:middle line:90%
>>TARPEY: Yes.

00:08:21.270 --> 00:08:27.080 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Now, we have some that
are said to have been imbued

00:08:27.080 --> 00:08:28.940 align:middle line:84%
or have come with
knowledge that was even

00:08:28.940 --> 00:08:32.495 align:middle line:84%
seeded from some other
star systems eons ago.

00:08:32.495 --> 00:08:33.995 align:middle line:84%
>>TARPEY: That's
very possible, yes.

00:08:33.995 --> 00:08:35.750 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And at the
same time, if you

00:08:35.750 --> 00:08:38.360 align:middle line:84%
take one that was
literally just carved

00:08:38.360 --> 00:08:42.960 align:middle line:84%
and you put it with you, or
someone, or a group of people,

00:08:42.960 --> 00:08:45.440 align:middle line:84%
these start taking
on that information.

00:08:45.440 --> 00:08:47.360 align:middle line:90%
And it's crystal technology.

00:08:47.360 --> 00:08:48.770 align:middle line:90%
It stores information.

00:08:48.770 --> 00:08:52.430 align:middle line:84%
So they start storing this
individual or collective

00:08:52.430 --> 00:08:56.010 align:middle line:84%
information and
become an egregore

00:08:56.010 --> 00:08:57.260 align:middle line:90%
in the good sense of the word.

00:08:57.260 --> 00:08:58.190 align:middle line:90%
>>TARPEY: Yes.

00:08:58.190 --> 00:08:59.990 align:middle line:84%
They start storing
in a different way

00:08:59.990 --> 00:09:03.170 align:middle line:90%
in the shape of the skull.

00:09:03.170 --> 00:09:06.050 align:middle line:84%
According to the
readings of Edgar Cayce,

00:09:06.050 --> 00:09:10.820 align:middle line:84%
the first purpose of crystal's
presence in the Earth

00:09:10.820 --> 00:09:14.850 align:middle line:84%
itself is communication
with other dimensions.

00:09:14.850 --> 00:09:15.650 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:09:15.650 --> 00:09:16.970 align:middle line:90%
>>TARPEY: That's his first use.

00:09:16.970 --> 00:09:17.360 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:09:17.360 --> 00:09:18.830 align:middle line:90%
>>TARPEY: Because it's memory.

00:09:18.830 --> 00:09:20.366 align:middle line:90%
It's capable of holding memory.

00:09:20.366 --> 00:09:21.658 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: It's memory, exactly.

00:09:21.658 --> 00:09:24.645 align:middle line:84%
>>TARPEY: And our computer
industry started with that.

00:09:24.645 --> 00:09:25.520 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Absolutely.

00:09:25.520 --> 00:09:29.190 align:middle line:84%
>>TARPEY: And so the
memory can be placed--

00:09:29.190 --> 00:09:30.800 align:middle line:90%
they're like recorders.

00:09:30.800 --> 00:09:33.800 align:middle line:84%
They are known to be
able to store knowledge.

00:09:33.800 --> 00:09:39.250 align:middle line:84%
And they are sacred to the
Maya because they represent--

00:09:39.250 --> 00:09:43.130 align:middle line:84%
the skull represents
the most sacred thing

00:09:43.130 --> 00:09:45.290 align:middle line:90%
in the Mayan world.

00:09:45.290 --> 00:09:47.210 align:middle line:84%
What the cross is
to the Christian,

00:09:47.210 --> 00:09:49.520 align:middle line:90%
the skull is to the Maya.

00:09:49.520 --> 00:09:54.150 align:middle line:84%
It's the symbol of the sacrifice
of the Christ of the Maya.

00:09:54.150 --> 00:09:59.930 align:middle line:84%
The skull represents
the way the twin Christ

00:09:59.930 --> 00:10:04.370 align:middle line:84%
history evolved in the Mayan
and the American world.

00:10:04.370 --> 00:10:08.420 align:middle line:84%
In most of the American
cultures, ancient cultures,

00:10:08.420 --> 00:10:14.780 align:middle line:84%
the Christ is represented
as two boys, twin boys.

00:10:14.780 --> 00:10:17.180 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Outside of the
Christian world, you're saying?

00:10:17.180 --> 00:10:20.690 align:middle line:84%
>>TARPEY: In the American world,
they're usually twin boys.

00:10:20.690 --> 00:10:24.520 align:middle line:84%
But also in Egypt and other
places, it reverberates.

00:10:24.520 --> 00:10:27.620 align:middle line:84%
And it also reverberates
in the Bible,

00:10:27.620 --> 00:10:31.160 align:middle line:84%
but that's the Mayan way
of looking at the Bible.

00:10:31.160 --> 00:10:36.620 align:middle line:84%
Because in the
Bible, Jesus Christ

00:10:36.620 --> 00:10:40.160 align:middle line:84%
was anointed to teach
by another person.

00:10:40.160 --> 00:10:43.810 align:middle line:84%
I believe it's his cousin,
John, John the Baptist.

00:10:43.810 --> 00:10:44.810 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Baptist, yeah.

00:10:44.810 --> 00:10:48.290 align:middle line:84%
>>TARPEY: And in the end,
he had his head cut off.

00:10:48.290 --> 00:10:50.000 align:middle line:90%
He was beheaded.

00:10:50.000 --> 00:10:53.780 align:middle line:84%
So to the Maya, that's
almost the same story.

00:10:53.780 --> 00:10:54.980 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Interesting.

00:10:54.980 --> 00:10:57.670 align:middle line:84%
I have to say, just going
tangentially for a moment,

00:10:57.670 --> 00:11:00.110 align:middle line:84%
one of the most profound
places I've ever been

00:11:00.110 --> 00:11:02.450 align:middle line:84%
was the cave of John
the Baptist, which

00:11:02.450 --> 00:11:03.800 align:middle line:90%
still-- that cave is there.

00:11:03.800 --> 00:11:05.880 align:middle line:84%
It's now housed
within a monastery.

00:11:05.880 --> 00:11:06.910 align:middle line:90%
>>TARPEY: Yes.

00:11:06.910 --> 00:11:09.050 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: And wow.

00:11:09.050 --> 00:11:11.480 align:middle line:84%
The information that flows
through that place-- and he

00:11:11.480 --> 00:11:14.930 align:middle line:84%
was known to be a seer and
retreat to the mountains

00:11:14.930 --> 00:11:16.230 align:middle line:90%
into his cave.

00:11:16.230 --> 00:11:17.280 align:middle line:90%
And this was the cave.

00:11:17.280 --> 00:11:18.162 align:middle line:90%
>>TARPEY: And so for the Maya--

00:11:18.162 --> 00:11:19.037 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Incredible.

00:11:19.037 --> 00:11:22.370 align:middle line:84%
>>TARPEY: --he is
the actual Christ.

00:11:22.370 --> 00:11:25.610 align:middle line:84%
And the actual Christ
in the Mayan world,

00:11:25.610 --> 00:11:27.890 align:middle line:84%
what we think after
a lot of research

00:11:27.890 --> 00:11:33.590 align:middle line:84%
is that the original Christ
created a projection of himself

00:11:33.590 --> 00:11:39.520 align:middle line:84%
in order to perform the acts
necessary for the sacrifice

00:11:39.520 --> 00:11:42.780 align:middle line:84%
that was intended in
the Christian mission.

00:11:42.780 --> 00:11:43.580 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:11:43.580 --> 00:11:48.800 align:middle line:84%
And I'm intrigued
with this symbolism.

00:11:48.800 --> 00:11:53.630 align:middle line:84%
I'm also intrigued with the
way in which crystal works.

00:11:53.630 --> 00:11:54.650 align:middle line:90%
>>TARPEY: Yes.

00:11:54.650 --> 00:11:57.710 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Because so many
people have stocks of crystal,

00:11:57.710 --> 00:11:59.780 align:middle line:84%
but no one knows
what they're for,

00:11:59.780 --> 00:12:02.810 align:middle line:84%
how to use them, how to respect
them, how to approach them.

00:12:02.810 --> 00:12:03.800 align:middle line:90%
>>TARPEY: Yes.

00:12:03.800 --> 00:12:06.650 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And so,
again, to me it's

00:12:06.650 --> 00:12:09.950 align:middle line:84%
fascinating that this had
been with these elders

00:12:09.950 --> 00:12:13.100 align:middle line:84%
and had absorbed their
body of knowledge,

00:12:13.100 --> 00:12:14.880 align:middle line:90%
and belief, and function.

00:12:14.880 --> 00:12:15.680 align:middle line:90%
>>TARPEY: Yes.

00:12:15.680 --> 00:12:19.010 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And so now let's
get to the part of this story.

00:12:19.010 --> 00:12:20.940 align:middle line:84%
You've come with a
whole entity here.

00:12:20.940 --> 00:12:21.740 align:middle line:90%
>>TARPEY: Yes.

00:12:21.740 --> 00:12:24.050 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And he's come
into the middle of yours

00:12:24.050 --> 00:12:24.900 align:middle line:90%
and nobody's life.

00:12:24.900 --> 00:12:27.410 align:middle line:90%


00:12:27.410 --> 00:12:29.240 align:middle line:84%
What started
happening in your life

00:12:29.240 --> 00:12:32.940 align:middle line:84%
to have this third entity imbued
with all this Central South

00:12:32.940 --> 00:12:35.240 align:middle line:90%
American ancient wisdom?

00:12:35.240 --> 00:12:38.420 align:middle line:84%
>>TARPEY: Well, what happened
was quite miraculous.

00:12:38.420 --> 00:12:43.370 align:middle line:84%
It was completely on
the subconscious level.

00:12:43.370 --> 00:12:47.300 align:middle line:84%
Once I received the
skull, the Mayan calendar

00:12:47.300 --> 00:12:52.340 align:middle line:84%
began to teach me with
greater speed what it's for.

00:12:52.340 --> 00:12:58.070 align:middle line:84%
I just started to practice
the Mayan calendar, not out

00:12:58.070 --> 00:13:02.150 align:middle line:84%
of any belief system because
I don't believe anything.

00:13:02.150 --> 00:13:04.400 align:middle line:90%
I only study.

00:13:04.400 --> 00:13:09.250 align:middle line:84%
And it just turned
out that the whole--

00:13:09.250 --> 00:13:16.550 align:middle line:84%
when this skull is in presence
with a client receiving a Mayan

00:13:16.550 --> 00:13:21.600 align:middle line:84%
calendar, my whole
behavior changes.

00:13:21.600 --> 00:13:26.300 align:middle line:84%
I have a formula of what
I'm going to say, a pattern.

00:13:26.300 --> 00:13:29.870 align:middle line:84%
And then all of a sudden,
I'm getting information

00:13:29.870 --> 00:13:34.670 align:middle line:84%
from the skull that
was very strange to me.

00:13:34.670 --> 00:13:38.870 align:middle line:90%
But because I study--

00:13:38.870 --> 00:13:43.080 align:middle line:84%
I do what I call shamanic
study, and I do ritual--

00:13:43.080 --> 00:13:45.860 align:middle line:90%
then I could trust that voice.

00:13:45.860 --> 00:13:50.830 align:middle line:84%
And ritual or ceremony
is the word sacrifice.

00:13:50.830 --> 00:13:55.100 align:middle line:84%
You're making a sacrifice, like
an ofrenda, a table, a mesa.

00:13:55.100 --> 00:13:56.990 align:middle line:90%
This is a mesa.

00:13:56.990 --> 00:14:01.250 align:middle line:84%
And when you make that sacrifice
and you make an offering, what

00:14:01.250 --> 00:14:06.560 align:middle line:84%
you're doing, because you
were educated in a science

00:14:06.560 --> 00:14:09.920 align:middle line:84%
type of a society,
a modern society,

00:14:09.920 --> 00:14:13.050 align:middle line:84%
you are sacrificing
your mind to your heart.

00:14:13.050 --> 00:14:13.850 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:14:13.850 --> 00:14:15.150 align:middle line:90%
That's a very good point.

00:14:15.150 --> 00:14:15.470 align:middle line:90%
>>TARPEY: Yes.

00:14:15.470 --> 00:14:16.270 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:14:16.270 --> 00:14:18.410 align:middle line:84%
>>TARPEY: And so when
you sacrifice your mind

00:14:18.410 --> 00:14:22.250 align:middle line:84%
to your heart, your
heart can now speak.

00:14:22.250 --> 00:14:24.770 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: But it means
the mind sometimes

00:14:24.770 --> 00:14:26.970 align:middle line:84%
goes into fear because
it's no longer in control.

00:14:26.970 --> 00:14:27.770 align:middle line:90%
>>TARPEY: Yes.

00:14:27.770 --> 00:14:30.270 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And this is the battle
that the Western world has,

00:14:30.270 --> 00:14:32.240 align:middle line:90%
between the mind and the heart.

00:14:32.240 --> 00:14:37.370 align:middle line:84%
>>TARPEY: And the heart is the
first to appear in the embryo.

00:14:37.370 --> 00:14:39.950 align:middle line:90%
And the heart takes precedence.

00:14:39.950 --> 00:14:42.360 align:middle line:90%
And we will not feel--

00:14:42.360 --> 00:14:44.620 align:middle line:84%
we will not succeed
on this Earth

00:14:44.620 --> 00:14:50.720 align:middle line:84%
in the job of peace and justice
until we feel the world.

00:14:50.720 --> 00:14:56.630 align:middle line:84%
And the Western mind is
tied up with hierarchy.

00:14:56.630 --> 00:14:58.610 align:middle line:84%
Because in their
sacred books, they

00:14:58.610 --> 00:15:02.060 align:middle line:84%
say that only the
human has a soul.

00:15:02.060 --> 00:15:04.820 align:middle line:84%
And the American Indian
had to keep a straight face

00:15:04.820 --> 00:15:06.590 align:middle line:90%
when they heard that.

00:15:06.590 --> 00:15:09.970 align:middle line:90%
Where did you get that idea?

00:15:09.970 --> 00:15:12.380 align:middle line:84%
We're all made from
the same stuff,

00:15:12.380 --> 00:15:15.380 align:middle line:90%
the same reservoir of spirit.

00:15:15.380 --> 00:15:18.270 align:middle line:84%
And they call that
reservoir [NON-ENGLISH]..

00:15:18.270 --> 00:15:20.850 align:middle line:90%
They have a glottal stop.

00:15:20.850 --> 00:15:25.410 align:middle line:84%
And it's a reservoir of spirit
that can produce anything.

00:15:25.410 --> 00:15:28.560 align:middle line:84%
It's like one of those
Arnold Schwarzkopf movies.

00:15:28.560 --> 00:15:30.630 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Schwarzenegger.

00:15:30.630 --> 00:15:34.530 align:middle line:84%
>>TARPEY: Schwarzkopf--
Arnold Schwarzenegger movies

00:15:34.530 --> 00:15:38.740 align:middle line:84%
where there's this guy made of
metallic stuff that conformed

00:15:38.740 --> 00:15:39.697 align:middle line:90%
himself into anything.

00:15:39.697 --> 00:15:40.260 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: "Terminator."

00:15:40.260 --> 00:15:41.060 align:middle line:90%
>>TARPEY: Yes.

00:15:41.060 --> 00:15:45.480 align:middle line:84%
That's sort of a visual metaphor
of what I'm talking about.

00:15:45.480 --> 00:15:47.100 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: He's out,
has a new movie.

00:15:47.100 --> 00:15:47.900 align:middle line:90%
>>TARPEY: Oh, wonderful.

00:15:47.900 --> 00:15:50.192 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: (ARNOLD SCHWARZENEGGER
VOICE) Arnold is back,

00:15:50.192 --> 00:15:52.080 align:middle line:84%
and he's advancing
his consciousness.

00:15:52.080 --> 00:15:53.520 align:middle line:90%
>>TARPEY: All right.

00:15:53.520 --> 00:15:56.475 align:middle line:90%
You give him a little ad here.

00:15:56.475 --> 00:15:58.350 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: After being
governor of California.

00:15:58.350 --> 00:16:00.240 align:middle line:90%
But yes, I digress.

00:16:00.240 --> 00:16:04.200 align:middle line:84%
>>TARPEY: And so anyway, when
the Maya look at the world

00:16:04.200 --> 00:16:07.420 align:middle line:90%
they see no hierarchy.

00:16:07.420 --> 00:16:09.780 align:middle line:90%
A stone is equal to a human.

00:16:09.780 --> 00:16:12.825 align:middle line:90%
A plant is equal to a human.

00:16:12.825 --> 00:16:16.480 align:middle line:84%
A piece of earth, a drop
of water in the ocean,

00:16:16.480 --> 00:16:18.540 align:middle line:90%
they're all equal.

00:16:18.540 --> 00:16:21.690 align:middle line:84%
So therefore we have a
relationship with them.

00:16:21.690 --> 00:16:26.070 align:middle line:84%
They're not empty things
that we use or dead things.

00:16:26.070 --> 00:16:29.400 align:middle line:84%
They have a direct
part in our evolution.

00:16:29.400 --> 00:16:31.660 align:middle line:90%
That's why we use crystals.

00:16:31.660 --> 00:16:35.680 align:middle line:84%
And I use pieces
of straw and reeds.

00:16:35.680 --> 00:16:37.510 align:middle line:90%
Reeds are very important.

00:16:37.510 --> 00:16:43.410 align:middle line:84%
And when you have that,
you lose the arrogance

00:16:43.410 --> 00:16:46.200 align:middle line:84%
of the Western mind, because
the Western mind thinks

00:16:46.200 --> 00:16:49.590 align:middle line:90%
the human is superior to all.

00:16:49.590 --> 00:16:54.150 align:middle line:84%
And that is not
correct, I don't think.

00:16:54.150 --> 00:16:56.420 align:middle line:84%
I always say I don't
think because I don't--

00:16:56.420 --> 00:16:57.270 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Because you
don't believe anything.

00:16:57.270 --> 00:16:58.080 align:middle line:90%
>>TARPEY: I don't believe.

00:16:58.080 --> 00:16:58.880 align:middle line:90%
I mentioned--

00:16:58.880 --> 00:17:01.680 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And let's just
go ahead and express

00:17:01.680 --> 00:17:06.810 align:middle line:84%
what that means, because you
have a very specific concept

00:17:06.810 --> 00:17:09.569 align:middle line:84%
around the notion of belief,
that once you form a belief

00:17:09.569 --> 00:17:11.364 align:middle line:84%
it closes off inquiry
and exploration.

00:17:11.364 --> 00:17:12.322 align:middle line:90%
>>TARPEY: That's right.

00:17:12.322 --> 00:17:15.089 align:middle line:84%
Because we are
speaking in German now.

00:17:15.089 --> 00:17:17.880 align:middle line:84%
When you speak English,
you're speaking German.

00:17:17.880 --> 00:17:21.990 align:middle line:84%
And the word "English"
itself, you have Anglo-Saxon.

00:17:21.990 --> 00:17:24.660 align:middle line:84%
Those are the name of
two of the conquering

00:17:24.660 --> 00:17:27.270 align:middle line:90%
tribes of the British Isles.

00:17:27.270 --> 00:17:31.680 align:middle line:84%
And the Engles in
German is Angle.

00:17:31.680 --> 00:17:34.860 align:middle line:84%
And the language they
spoke is Anglisc.

00:17:34.860 --> 00:17:39.390 align:middle line:84%
And so our language is the
language of a German tribe,

00:17:39.390 --> 00:17:42.030 align:middle line:84%
only it's been influenced
by Latin and Greek,

00:17:42.030 --> 00:17:47.022 align:middle line:84%
and other Gaelic, Celtic
terms are in there.

00:17:47.022 --> 00:17:49.230 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So is this going
back to the word "belief?"

00:17:49.230 --> 00:17:51.673 align:middle line:84%
>>TARPEY: And belief, it
means to be in love, lieben.

00:17:51.673 --> 00:17:53.590 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So if you're
in love with something,

00:17:53.590 --> 00:17:55.170 align:middle line:84%
then that means you
have attachment.

00:17:55.170 --> 00:17:56.795 align:middle line:84%
And if you have
attachment, then you're

00:17:56.795 --> 00:17:57.881 align:middle line:90%
only focused that one way.

00:17:57.881 --> 00:17:58.140 align:middle line:90%
>>TARPEY: It's an attachment.

00:17:58.140 --> 00:17:58.680 align:middle line:90%
It's an attachment.

00:17:58.680 --> 00:17:59.480 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: I see.

00:17:59.480 --> 00:18:03.360 align:middle line:84%
>>TARPEY: And B-E means already
done, completed in German.

00:18:03.360 --> 00:18:11.030 align:middle line:84%
"Beliebt"-- I am beloved, or
I totally have this belief.

00:18:11.030 --> 00:18:15.060 align:middle line:84%
It's equal to the G-E,
like lernt and gelernt,

00:18:15.060 --> 00:18:17.100 align:middle line:90%
I have already learned.

00:18:17.100 --> 00:18:18.690 align:middle line:90%
I have already fallen in love.

00:18:18.690 --> 00:18:19.490 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:18:19.490 --> 00:18:21.150 align:middle line:84%
>>TARPEY: I'm married
to this thought.

00:18:21.150 --> 00:18:23.067 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So you're
committed to this thought,

00:18:23.067 --> 00:18:26.100 align:middle line:84%
and it closes down the option
for further exploration.

00:18:26.100 --> 00:18:28.650 align:middle line:84%
>>TARPEY: And it
also means to prefer.

00:18:28.650 --> 00:18:33.920 align:middle line:84%
Like if I say, [GERMAN],,
I prefer red wine.

00:18:33.920 --> 00:18:37.458 align:middle line:84%
And preference is the
beginning of all corruption.

00:18:37.458 --> 00:18:39.000 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Oh, no,
that's interesting.

00:18:39.000 --> 00:18:40.770 align:middle line:84%
Because when you
think about it--

00:18:40.770 --> 00:18:42.520 align:middle line:90%
I've thought this before too.

00:18:42.520 --> 00:18:46.050 align:middle line:84%
And we'll go back where we were,
but this is an important thing.

00:18:46.050 --> 00:18:48.810 align:middle line:84%
Once we have-- in the
West we seem to do this,

00:18:48.810 --> 00:18:50.580 align:middle line:84%
but it happens all
over the world.

00:18:50.580 --> 00:18:55.560 align:middle line:84%
Once we have our preferences set
higher and higher and higher,

00:18:55.560 --> 00:19:00.450 align:middle line:84%
possibility, joy, surprise,
being in the moment all

00:19:00.450 --> 00:19:01.710 align:middle line:90%
starts collapsing.

00:19:01.710 --> 00:19:02.767 align:middle line:90%
>>TARPEY: Correct, yes.

00:19:02.767 --> 00:19:04.350 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And then
we're literally not

00:19:04.350 --> 00:19:06.194 align:middle line:84%
open to life that's
happening around us.

00:19:06.194 --> 00:19:06.870 align:middle line:84%
>>TARPEY: We're
acting on the stage.

00:19:06.870 --> 00:19:08.250 align:middle line:90%
We're acting on the stage.

00:19:08.250 --> 00:19:09.120 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:19:09.120 --> 00:19:11.340 align:middle line:84%
>>TARPEY: And what
Ralph Waldo Emerson said

00:19:11.340 --> 00:19:16.260 align:middle line:84%
is, "The greatest achievement
that the human can possibly

00:19:16.260 --> 00:19:21.270 align:middle line:84%
succeed to is the formation
of their own selves and not

00:19:21.270 --> 00:19:23.822 align:middle line:90%
something built by others."

00:19:23.822 --> 00:19:25.530 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: But in the
case of preferences,

00:19:25.530 --> 00:19:28.650 align:middle line:84%
we're often building
those out of our own

00:19:28.650 --> 00:19:30.290 align:middle line:84%
either repulsions
or attractions.

00:19:30.290 --> 00:19:31.650 align:middle line:90%
>>TARPEY: Yes, yes.

00:19:31.650 --> 00:19:33.660 align:middle line:84%
And they're there, and
we come in with them

00:19:33.660 --> 00:19:34.890 align:middle line:90%
because of past lives.

00:19:34.890 --> 00:19:35.880 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:19:35.880 --> 00:19:36.750 align:middle line:90%
>>TARPEY: And we have dreams.

00:19:36.750 --> 00:19:38.625 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So it's part of
the subconscious baggage.

00:19:38.625 --> 00:19:39.425 align:middle line:90%
>>TARPEY: Yes.

00:19:39.425 --> 00:19:41.910 align:middle line:84%
It's the subconscious
baggage that we come in with.

00:19:41.910 --> 00:19:45.000 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So when we're
talking about preferences

00:19:45.000 --> 00:19:47.880 align:middle line:84%
as actually leading
to corruption,

00:19:47.880 --> 00:19:50.400 align:middle line:90%
explain what you mean by that.

00:19:50.400 --> 00:19:53.220 align:middle line:84%
I can see where it definitely
leads to all limitation.

00:19:53.220 --> 00:19:55.650 align:middle line:84%
>>TARPEY: Well,
especially in government.

00:19:55.650 --> 00:19:59.860 align:middle line:84%
We have the talented people,
but we prefer our own companies.

00:19:59.860 --> 00:20:03.660 align:middle line:84%
We have the talented people,
but we prefer our brother-in-law

00:20:03.660 --> 00:20:07.350 align:middle line:84%
or get one of our
members of our family in.

00:20:07.350 --> 00:20:09.683 align:middle line:90%
And then everything goes awry.

00:20:09.683 --> 00:20:11.350 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Yes, I see
what you're saying.

00:20:11.350 --> 00:20:14.340 align:middle line:84%
>>TARPEY: And preference
is also the inability

00:20:14.340 --> 00:20:17.870 align:middle line:84%
to listen to other people
because we're so involved

00:20:17.870 --> 00:20:19.340 align:middle line:90%
with a particular group.

00:20:19.340 --> 00:20:21.110 align:middle line:90%
We don't listen anymore.

00:20:21.110 --> 00:20:22.790 align:middle line:90%
We're loyal.

00:20:22.790 --> 00:20:26.660 align:middle line:84%
We prefer that group,
and we gag ourselves

00:20:26.660 --> 00:20:29.210 align:middle line:84%
because then we're not
allowed to say what

00:20:29.210 --> 00:20:31.250 align:middle line:90%
that group wants us to say.

00:20:31.250 --> 00:20:34.110 align:middle line:84%
We have been built
by that group.

00:20:34.110 --> 00:20:37.480 align:middle line:84%
And that begins in
high school, formally.

00:20:37.480 --> 00:20:40.940 align:middle line:84%
95% of the people in
the world, in my view,

00:20:40.940 --> 00:20:43.880 align:middle line:84%
have never graduated
from high school

00:20:43.880 --> 00:20:47.060 align:middle line:84%
because they're still
in the same groups.

00:20:47.060 --> 00:20:48.380 align:middle line:90%
They go to their companies.

00:20:48.380 --> 00:20:50.210 align:middle line:90%
They go to the government.

00:20:50.210 --> 00:20:51.480 align:middle line:90%
And they join the groups.

00:20:51.480 --> 00:20:54.530 align:middle line:84%
And we've all met those
groups and organizations.

00:20:54.530 --> 00:20:57.080 align:middle line:84%
They sort of bite at each
other and pull the legs out

00:20:57.080 --> 00:21:02.120 align:middle line:84%
from each other in struggling
for the attention and the love

00:21:02.120 --> 00:21:08.160 align:middle line:84%
of the owner of the company
or the highest official,

00:21:08.160 --> 00:21:10.700 align:middle line:90%
struggling to be favored.

00:21:10.700 --> 00:21:16.677 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So thank you for
explaining that in more detail.

00:21:16.677 --> 00:21:19.010 align:middle line:84%
And I'm with you on that, the
whole thing of preference.

00:21:19.010 --> 00:21:21.543 align:middle line:84%
Because I've noticed in
my own life even where

00:21:21.543 --> 00:21:23.210 align:middle line:84%
I'll start getting a
lot of preferences.

00:21:23.210 --> 00:21:25.385 align:middle line:84%
I don't like this, or
I want this this way,

00:21:25.385 --> 00:21:26.630 align:middle line:90%
or I want this this way.

00:21:26.630 --> 00:21:28.310 align:middle line:84%
You're setting yourself
up to be at odds

00:21:28.310 --> 00:21:30.173 align:middle line:84%
with the world for
disappointment,

00:21:30.173 --> 00:21:32.465 align:middle line:84%
because the world doesn't
have your set of preferences.

00:21:32.465 --> 00:21:33.290 align:middle line:90%
>>TARPEY: That's right.

00:21:33.290 --> 00:21:35.180 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And so everything's
bumping up against you,

00:21:35.180 --> 00:21:37.222 align:middle line:84%
and you're constantly
ticked off because it's not

00:21:37.222 --> 00:21:38.870 align:middle line:90%
ticking your boxes.

00:21:38.870 --> 00:21:40.670 align:middle line:84%
And it's just such
a difficult way

00:21:40.670 --> 00:21:43.190 align:middle line:90%
to live and experience life.

00:21:43.190 --> 00:21:45.680 align:middle line:84%
Plus, the impulses
coming in constantly

00:21:45.680 --> 00:21:48.200 align:middle line:84%
from both the higher mind,
and the subconscious mind,

00:21:48.200 --> 00:21:49.880 align:middle line:84%
and the world
around us are being

00:21:49.880 --> 00:21:52.712 align:middle line:84%
ignored because they're
striving so hard to simply live

00:21:52.712 --> 00:21:53.670 align:middle line:90%
our set of preferences.

00:21:53.670 --> 00:21:54.480 align:middle line:90%
>>TARPEY: Yes.

00:21:54.480 --> 00:21:57.830 align:middle line:84%
And we are careful what
we say because if we

00:21:57.830 --> 00:21:59.900 align:middle line:84%
say the wrong thing
in the group, then

00:21:59.900 --> 00:22:01.910 align:middle line:90%
we go to the periphery.

00:22:01.910 --> 00:22:03.780 align:middle line:84%
We are not in the
center anymore.

00:22:03.780 --> 00:22:07.290 align:middle line:84%
And we derive so much
advantages from the group

00:22:07.290 --> 00:22:11.520 align:middle line:84%
because we are basket cases
of trauma as human beings.

00:22:11.520 --> 00:22:12.320 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: We are.

00:22:12.320 --> 00:22:14.092 align:middle line:84%
And that's where we're going
to go next in the conversation.

00:22:14.092 --> 00:22:14.770 align:middle line:90%
>>TARPEY: OK, yeah.

00:22:14.770 --> 00:22:17.270 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And let's talk about
the factors that have made us

00:22:17.270 --> 00:22:23.780 align:middle line:84%
need to cling to norms, to cling
to one another who we prefer,

00:22:23.780 --> 00:22:26.345 align:middle line:84%
and to be deaf to
those we do not prefer.

00:22:26.345 --> 00:22:27.800 align:middle line:90%
>>TARPEY: Yes, yes.

00:22:27.800 --> 00:22:32.300 align:middle line:84%
We're so vulnerable when
we come in, struggling,

00:22:32.300 --> 00:22:38.360 align:middle line:84%
competing with siblings
for love and attention.

00:22:38.360 --> 00:22:45.410 align:middle line:84%
And I got this, as I
mentioned to you before--

00:22:45.410 --> 00:22:50.210 align:middle line:84%
one day, I saw two over
70-year-old siblings

00:22:50.210 --> 00:22:54.830 align:middle line:84%
arguing with each other
over who mommy loved best.

00:22:54.830 --> 00:22:56.250 align:middle line:90%
It never stops.

00:22:56.250 --> 00:22:57.050 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:22:57.050 --> 00:22:59.030 align:middle line:84%
>>TARPEY: It's
way deep in there.

00:22:59.030 --> 00:23:01.050 align:middle line:90%
And it causes such--

00:23:01.050 --> 00:23:03.560 align:middle line:90%
it makes us so competitive.

00:23:03.560 --> 00:23:07.370 align:middle line:84%
And that's why it's so important
to find ourselves and the love

00:23:07.370 --> 00:23:09.680 align:middle line:90%
of ourselves within.

00:23:09.680 --> 00:23:13.543 align:middle line:90%
And then we're on first base.

00:23:13.543 --> 00:23:15.710 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: If you want to
look at it in other cycles,

00:23:15.710 --> 00:23:18.410 align:middle line:84%
we look at large calamities
that have happened to the Earth

00:23:18.410 --> 00:23:23.420 align:middle line:84%
also, creating incredible mass
trauma of not even knowing

00:23:23.420 --> 00:23:26.250 align:middle line:84%
if the land you stand
on on a very deep level

00:23:26.250 --> 00:23:28.100 align:middle line:90%
will be there an hour from now.

00:23:28.100 --> 00:23:29.300 align:middle line:90%
>>TARPEY: Exactly.

00:23:29.300 --> 00:23:31.132 align:middle line:84%
You took it to the
bigger picture, yes.

00:23:31.132 --> 00:23:31.850 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: The great
deluge and so forth.

00:23:31.850 --> 00:23:32.210 align:middle line:90%
>>TARPEY: Yes.

00:23:32.210 --> 00:23:34.070 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: We all
carry that great--

00:23:34.070 --> 00:23:36.320 align:middle line:84%
most of us carry that
great trauma with us--

00:23:36.320 --> 00:23:37.113 align:middle line:90%
>>TARPEY: It's not a safe place.

00:23:37.113 --> 00:23:37.850 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: --our own survival.

00:23:37.850 --> 00:23:38.650 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:23:38.650 --> 00:23:41.390 align:middle line:84%
>>TARPEY: It was not designed
as a comfortable place.

00:23:41.390 --> 00:23:43.200 align:middle line:90%
It's awesome.

00:23:43.200 --> 00:23:48.140 align:middle line:84%
And the Maya I appreciated
that awesomeness, that beauty,

00:23:48.140 --> 00:23:51.170 align:middle line:84%
because it's scary and
beautiful at the same time.

00:23:51.170 --> 00:23:53.630 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: You call it a
rawness, that Earth life

00:23:53.630 --> 00:23:55.940 align:middle line:90%
offers a very raw experience.

00:23:55.940 --> 00:23:58.190 align:middle line:90%
>>TARPEY: It's a raw experience.

00:23:58.190 --> 00:23:59.780 align:middle line:90%
And because of it--

00:23:59.780 --> 00:24:05.780 align:middle line:84%
and looking at it objectively,
one thing eats the other here.

00:24:05.780 --> 00:24:08.810 align:middle line:84%
And so it is not--
it's designed--

00:24:08.810 --> 00:24:12.620 align:middle line:84%
as Edgar Cayce-- through
the readings of Edgar Cayce

00:24:12.620 --> 00:24:16.790 align:middle line:84%
it came out, the name
Laboratory Earth.

00:24:16.790 --> 00:24:21.110 align:middle line:84%
It is designed by
something or somebody.

00:24:21.110 --> 00:24:23.120 align:middle line:90%
That, I see.

00:24:23.120 --> 00:24:26.990 align:middle line:90%
It is exquisitely intelligent.

00:24:26.990 --> 00:24:29.210 align:middle line:84%
The more we look at
it-- we talked before

00:24:29.210 --> 00:24:33.920 align:middle line:84%
about our human body
that runs itself.

00:24:33.920 --> 00:24:36.890 align:middle line:90%
We don't do anything.

00:24:36.890 --> 00:24:39.335 align:middle line:84%
Our consciousness
doesn't do anything,

00:24:39.335 --> 00:24:43.160 align:middle line:84%
and animals have
the same function.

00:24:43.160 --> 00:24:45.380 align:middle line:84%
And yet it's
totally intelligent,

00:24:45.380 --> 00:24:48.020 align:middle line:90%
but automatically intelligent.

00:24:48.020 --> 00:24:50.260 align:middle line:84%
And that's why animals
are equal to us

00:24:50.260 --> 00:24:53.310 align:middle line:84%
and the American
Indians consider animals

00:24:53.310 --> 00:24:55.250 align:middle line:90%
the first people.

00:24:55.250 --> 00:25:00.320 align:middle line:84%
And we live by the standard
of coyote, the trickster.

00:25:00.320 --> 00:25:03.380 align:middle line:90%
Coyote wound up doing things--

00:25:03.380 --> 00:25:07.040 align:middle line:84%
it's almost like when I give
a Mayan calendar reading.

00:25:07.040 --> 00:25:10.070 align:middle line:84%
People are like the coyote
of the American Indian

00:25:10.070 --> 00:25:13.160 align:middle line:84%
because they're actually
doing the right thing,

00:25:13.160 --> 00:25:15.380 align:middle line:90%
but they don't know it.

00:25:15.380 --> 00:25:17.790 align:middle line:84%
So when I do the Mayan
calendar reading,

00:25:17.790 --> 00:25:20.440 align:middle line:84%
I look at all of
what they've done.

00:25:20.440 --> 00:25:21.620 align:middle line:90%
And they're already there.

00:25:21.620 --> 00:25:26.950 align:middle line:84%
They're already pointing the
way towards their shamanship.

00:25:26.950 --> 00:25:30.920 align:middle line:84%
And their shamanship
has to be independent.

00:25:30.920 --> 00:25:33.430 align:middle line:90%
They must become a self.

00:25:33.430 --> 00:25:37.930 align:middle line:84%
So they must plan their
escape from organizations,

00:25:37.930 --> 00:25:40.870 align:middle line:84%
because organizations
have the groups.

00:25:40.870 --> 00:25:43.720 align:middle line:84%
And it's very difficult
to be yourself

00:25:43.720 --> 00:25:46.720 align:middle line:84%
when you're economically
independent-- you're not

00:25:46.720 --> 00:25:47.693 align:middle line:90%
independent.

00:25:47.693 --> 00:25:49.610 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Yeah, dependent
on the organization.

00:25:49.610 --> 00:25:52.660 align:middle line:84%
>>TARPEY: And so that's why
the Maya have a ball game

00:25:52.660 --> 00:25:54.940 align:middle line:90%
court at every site.

00:25:54.940 --> 00:25:58.870 align:middle line:84%
You're playing the ball
game against death.

00:25:58.870 --> 00:26:02.860 align:middle line:84%
And death is something
that will just

00:26:02.860 --> 00:26:08.270 align:middle line:84%
make you go corrupt
spiritually more quickly.

00:26:08.270 --> 00:26:14.140 align:middle line:84%
And you must be a trickster
in that game in order to win,

00:26:14.140 --> 00:26:15.700 align:middle line:90%
because the twins--

00:26:15.700 --> 00:26:18.820 align:middle line:84%
there was a second set of
twins born from the first.

00:26:18.820 --> 00:26:20.860 align:middle line:90%
And they were the tricksters.

00:26:20.860 --> 00:26:25.040 align:middle line:84%
And they played the ball
game, and they tricked death.

00:26:25.040 --> 00:26:29.968 align:middle line:84%
And because they tricked death,
death had less power over them.

00:26:29.968 --> 00:26:31.760 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And it seems
that all of humanity

00:26:31.760 --> 00:26:33.093 align:middle line:90%
is always trying to trick death.

00:26:33.093 --> 00:26:35.230 align:middle line:84%
It doesn't matter which
culture because we're

00:26:35.230 --> 00:26:37.420 align:middle line:84%
living in an animal
body that fears

00:26:37.420 --> 00:26:41.020 align:middle line:84%
for its own survival on a very,
very deep, unconscious level.

00:26:41.020 --> 00:26:43.300 align:middle line:90%
>>TARPEY: Exactly.

00:26:43.300 --> 00:26:46.030 align:middle line:84%
We always want to
survive, but we always

00:26:46.030 --> 00:26:49.570 align:middle line:84%
have to work on
the fear of death.

00:26:49.570 --> 00:26:52.970 align:middle line:84%
I'm getting older now,
and I'm not immune to it.

00:26:52.970 --> 00:26:56.020 align:middle line:84%
And so that's what
this west is for.

00:26:56.020 --> 00:26:57.620 align:middle line:90%
The west place is--

00:26:57.620 --> 00:27:02.380 align:middle line:84%
the Egyptians always buried
their dead on the west bank.

00:27:02.380 --> 00:27:04.750 align:middle line:90%
That's where the sun went down.

00:27:04.750 --> 00:27:07.870 align:middle line:84%
And there's the idea that you
will go back into the earth,

00:27:07.870 --> 00:27:09.058 align:middle line:90%
and you will be cleansed.

00:27:09.058 --> 00:27:11.100 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And come up in
the east on the sunrise.

00:27:11.100 --> 00:27:12.767 align:middle line:84%
>>TARPEY: And come
up in the east again,

00:27:12.767 --> 00:27:16.510 align:middle line:84%
yes, in another
lifetime, but this time

00:27:16.510 --> 00:27:19.615 align:middle line:84%
more cleansed by all the
intelligence of Earth.

00:27:19.615 --> 00:27:21.490 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And let's go
back to that a moment.

00:27:21.490 --> 00:27:22.870 align:middle line:90%
>>TARPEY: Yes.

00:27:22.870 --> 00:27:25.060 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Give us a
little history lesson--

00:27:25.060 --> 00:27:26.950 align:middle line:84%
I mean, it's obvious
on one level,

00:27:26.950 --> 00:27:29.200 align:middle line:90%
but let's just articulate it.

00:27:29.200 --> 00:27:30.250 align:middle line:90%
>>TARPEY: Yes.

00:27:30.250 --> 00:27:31.690 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: A history
lesson of what

00:27:31.690 --> 00:27:37.390 align:middle line:84%
happened when humanity
started disconnecting itself

00:27:37.390 --> 00:27:41.560 align:middle line:84%
from natural systems of
the Earth, from nature,

00:27:41.560 --> 00:27:44.650 align:middle line:84%
and started putting
ourselves above everything

00:27:44.650 --> 00:27:45.940 align:middle line:90%
else on this planet.

00:27:45.940 --> 00:27:48.550 align:middle line:84%
>>TARPEY: Well, it
speeds up when we

00:27:48.550 --> 00:27:52.990 align:middle line:90%
make advances in material life.

00:27:52.990 --> 00:27:57.250 align:middle line:84%
Hunter-gatherers, for
them everything is equal.

00:27:57.250 --> 00:28:00.622 align:middle line:84%
You'll notice the drawings
in the ancient French caves--

00:28:00.622 --> 00:28:02.080 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: They're
40,000 years old.

00:28:02.080 --> 00:28:05.800 align:middle line:84%
>>TARPEY: --paleolithic
era, the respect

00:28:05.800 --> 00:28:08.560 align:middle line:84%
in how they drew the
animal because they

00:28:08.560 --> 00:28:13.330 align:middle line:84%
knew that the animal
was created for them.

00:28:13.330 --> 00:28:15.760 align:middle line:84%
It was natural that
that was their food.

00:28:15.760 --> 00:28:19.420 align:middle line:84%
And they respected the animal,
and they would waste nothing.

00:28:19.420 --> 00:28:22.450 align:middle line:84%
And so the word
"respect" is Latin--

00:28:22.450 --> 00:28:28.750 align:middle line:84%
R-E, again, S-P-E-C-T, like
spectacles, a spectator,

00:28:28.750 --> 00:28:34.130 align:middle line:84%
to look, spectare,
to look again.

00:28:34.130 --> 00:28:37.420 align:middle line:84%
And so when you don't
respect something,

00:28:37.420 --> 00:28:40.090 align:middle line:90%
you don't give it a second look.

00:28:40.090 --> 00:28:41.380 align:middle line:90%
You're above it.

00:28:41.380 --> 00:28:43.750 align:middle line:90%
You have nothing to do with it.

00:28:43.750 --> 00:28:46.210 align:middle line:84%
And the American
Indian, the reason

00:28:46.210 --> 00:28:49.390 align:middle line:84%
I wound up studying
them so much is I've

00:28:49.390 --> 00:28:54.580 align:middle line:84%
never seen a culture
in the modern world

00:28:54.580 --> 00:29:01.000 align:middle line:84%
that has saved that idea of
the equality of all things.

00:29:01.000 --> 00:29:05.000 align:middle line:84%
And the people of the West
have a choice to make.

00:29:05.000 --> 00:29:09.040 align:middle line:84%
Are they going to
believe or take

00:29:09.040 --> 00:29:13.750 align:middle line:84%
the basic assumption that
comes from the epitome of it

00:29:13.750 --> 00:29:19.190 align:middle line:84%
in the Sistine Chapel, the
painting by Michelangelo.

00:29:19.190 --> 00:29:19.990 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: God.

00:29:19.990 --> 00:29:24.340 align:middle line:84%
>>TARPEY: Of the macho
man god in the sky,

00:29:24.340 --> 00:29:27.670 align:middle line:84%
extending his hand and
fingers to the macho man,

00:29:27.670 --> 00:29:32.950 align:middle line:84%
representative of the
Earth and imparting soul.

00:29:32.950 --> 00:29:36.220 align:middle line:84%
We have a choice
between that and ask

00:29:36.220 --> 00:29:40.210 align:middle line:84%
as the American Indian
asked, isn't our intelligence

00:29:40.210 --> 00:29:43.180 align:middle line:90%
coming from our food?

00:29:43.180 --> 00:29:46.840 align:middle line:10%
Isn't the plant the
only independent source

00:29:46.840 --> 00:29:48.880 align:middle line:10%
of making food?

00:29:48.880 --> 00:29:52.960 align:middle line:84%
Isn't it the one that is
giving us our intelligence?

00:29:52.960 --> 00:29:57.100 align:middle line:84%
But it's not-- it's
embedded in everything.

00:29:57.100 --> 00:29:59.440 align:middle line:84%
Everything is
completely intelligent

00:29:59.440 --> 00:30:03.700 align:middle line:84%
because it's all made
of the same material,

00:30:03.700 --> 00:30:07.090 align:middle line:84%
but it doesn't have
the voice as we have.

00:30:07.090 --> 00:30:09.700 align:middle line:84%
Because according to
the Mayan records,

00:30:09.700 --> 00:30:13.360 align:middle line:84%
the voice was very
important at this time

00:30:13.360 --> 00:30:17.020 align:middle line:84%
for what we would call the
fourth root race in whatever

00:30:17.020 --> 00:30:19.360 align:middle line:90%
the divine plan is.

00:30:19.360 --> 00:30:23.410 align:middle line:84%
But we cannot take
ourselves that seriously.

00:30:23.410 --> 00:30:25.640 align:middle line:84%
The environment
is very important.

00:30:25.640 --> 00:30:28.820 align:middle line:84%
And if we lose our
sensitivity to it,

00:30:28.820 --> 00:30:31.600 align:middle line:84%
we will destroy
ourselves as we've

00:30:31.600 --> 00:30:35.050 align:middle line:84%
done through civilization,
after civilization,

00:30:35.050 --> 00:30:37.020 align:middle line:90%
after civilization.

00:30:37.020 --> 00:30:39.100 align:middle line:84%
And what's the
definition of insanity?

00:30:39.100 --> 00:30:41.950 align:middle line:84%
Doing the same thing
again and again

00:30:41.950 --> 00:30:44.140 align:middle line:84%
and expecting a
different result.

00:30:44.140 --> 00:30:45.730 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Well,
we're consistent.

00:30:45.730 --> 00:30:47.290 align:middle line:90%
>>TARPEY: Yes, very consistent.

00:30:47.290 --> 00:30:49.670 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: We're on track
to do the same thing again.

00:30:49.670 --> 00:30:50.930 align:middle line:90%
Let's take it back to nature.

00:30:50.930 --> 00:30:53.770 align:middle line:84%
And one thing I don't think you
and I have ever talked about,

00:30:53.770 --> 00:30:58.160 align:middle line:84%
which I feel very close affinity
with, is the trees and, for me,

00:30:58.160 --> 00:31:00.890 align:middle line:84%
particularly the giant redwood
trees and the coastal redwood

00:31:00.890 --> 00:31:00.896 align:middle line:90%
trees.

00:31:00.896 --> 00:31:02.500 align:middle line:84%
>>TARPEY: Oh, give
me chills now.

00:31:02.500 --> 00:31:04.110 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: I just love them.

00:31:04.110 --> 00:31:11.230 align:middle line:84%
And I think back to the wisdom
that was held and utilized

00:31:11.230 --> 00:31:16.210 align:middle line:84%
during the Atlantean times
and how after the deluge

00:31:16.210 --> 00:31:22.000 align:middle line:84%
that that wisdom went through
the precursors to the druids

00:31:22.000 --> 00:31:24.100 align:middle line:84%
and remained, went
into the Celtic lands.

00:31:24.100 --> 00:31:26.080 align:middle line:84%
And they sat at the
side of each king

00:31:26.080 --> 00:31:28.960 align:middle line:84%
because they still had
knowledge, vision, and wisdom.

00:31:28.960 --> 00:31:32.100 align:middle line:84%
But the tree was
their actual alphabet.

00:31:32.100 --> 00:31:36.060 align:middle line:84%
Their alphabet, every letter
was based on a species of tree.

00:31:36.060 --> 00:31:37.142 align:middle line:90%
And so let's talk about--

00:31:37.142 --> 00:31:38.350 align:middle line:90%
>>TARPEY: Especially the oak.

00:31:38.350 --> 00:31:38.462 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:31:38.462 --> 00:31:39.670 align:middle line:90%
>>TARPEY: They loved the oak.

00:31:39.670 --> 00:31:41.980 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So let's
talk about the kingdom

00:31:41.980 --> 00:31:45.760 align:middle line:84%
of this overstory
of trees that was

00:31:45.760 --> 00:31:48.512 align:middle line:84%
once in greater
supply on this planet

00:31:48.512 --> 00:31:50.845 align:middle line:84%
and the diminishment of that
in the Amazon and so forth.

00:31:50.845 --> 00:31:51.760 align:middle line:90%
>>TARPEY: Yes, yes.

00:31:51.760 --> 00:31:57.790 align:middle line:84%
And for the Maya, the
tree of life, the ceiba

00:31:57.790 --> 00:31:59.590 align:middle line:90%
tree or the "keiba" tree--

00:31:59.590 --> 00:32:01.795 align:middle line:84%
I forget how they
pronounce it in Spanish--

00:32:01.795 --> 00:32:04.450 align:middle line:90%


00:32:04.450 --> 00:32:05.660 align:middle line:90%
it is the tree of life.

00:32:05.660 --> 00:32:07.240 align:middle line:84%
The root's from the
underworld, where

00:32:07.240 --> 00:32:11.000 align:middle line:84%
we came from, because the
plants are clean and beautiful.

00:32:11.000 --> 00:32:13.620 align:middle line:90%
There's no hell.

00:32:13.620 --> 00:32:16.390 align:middle line:84%
It's just a testing
place, a cleansing place

00:32:16.390 --> 00:32:19.870 align:middle line:84%
underneath there, according
to the American Indian.

00:32:19.870 --> 00:32:24.250 align:middle line:84%
And our roots come from
underneath the earth

00:32:24.250 --> 00:32:26.200 align:middle line:90%
because we eat the plants.

00:32:26.200 --> 00:32:29.920 align:middle line:84%
Then we have the
trunk that is here

00:32:29.920 --> 00:32:33.430 align:middle line:84%
on the surface and then
the leaves that extend

00:32:33.430 --> 00:32:34.960 align:middle line:90%
toward the sky, the heavens.

00:32:34.960 --> 00:32:41.330 align:middle line:84%
So it becomes a symbol of
us and our cosmos, the tree,

00:32:41.330 --> 00:32:43.750 align:middle line:90%
and how huge--

00:32:43.750 --> 00:32:45.250 align:middle line:84%
when you look at
them, the branches,

00:32:45.250 --> 00:32:48.520 align:middle line:84%
they look like human
beings extending upward.

00:32:48.520 --> 00:32:50.200 align:middle line:84%
Did you ever look at
the tree like that?

00:32:50.200 --> 00:32:50.950 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Oh, absolutely.

00:32:50.950 --> 00:32:51.750 align:middle line:90%
I do.

00:32:51.750 --> 00:32:55.000 align:middle line:84%
And I look at the saguaro
cactus like that in Arizona.

00:32:55.000 --> 00:32:56.420 align:middle line:90%
>>TARPEY: The saguaro, yes.

00:32:56.420 --> 00:32:57.220 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:32:57.220 --> 00:33:03.580 align:middle line:84%
And I was once told that the
trees, what we don't understand

00:33:03.580 --> 00:33:05.710 align:middle line:84%
is they live in
generations of families

00:33:05.710 --> 00:33:07.300 align:middle line:90%
with passed on knowledge too.

00:33:07.300 --> 00:33:08.100 align:middle line:90%
>>TARPEY: Yes.

00:33:08.100 --> 00:33:10.510 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And when you do
clear cutting, for example,

00:33:10.510 --> 00:33:11.950 align:middle line:90%
you cut down all that wisdom.

00:33:11.950 --> 00:33:15.760 align:middle line:84%
And the trees that are just
now planted in tree farms

00:33:15.760 --> 00:33:17.860 align:middle line:84%
never grow with
the same integrity,

00:33:17.860 --> 00:33:20.380 align:middle line:84%
strength, immune
system because they

00:33:20.380 --> 00:33:24.360 align:middle line:84%
have no parental
passed-on knowledge.

00:33:24.360 --> 00:33:25.810 align:middle line:84%
>>TARPEY: And
there's no respect.

00:33:25.810 --> 00:33:26.745 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And no
respect for them.

00:33:26.745 --> 00:33:27.400 align:middle line:90%
>>TARPEY: No respect.

00:33:27.400 --> 00:33:28.870 align:middle line:84%
And if there's no
respect, they're

00:33:28.870 --> 00:33:31.940 align:middle line:84%
wasting because they
want to accumulate.

00:33:31.940 --> 00:33:32.740 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:33:32.740 --> 00:33:35.875 align:middle line:84%
>>TARPEY: And that's what caused
the problems after the hunting

00:33:35.875 --> 00:33:38.140 align:middle line:90%
and gathering age.

00:33:38.140 --> 00:33:43.450 align:middle line:84%
They started to grow crops,
and they had extra time.

00:33:43.450 --> 00:33:44.920 align:middle line:90%
And they began to trade.

00:33:44.920 --> 00:33:48.190 align:middle line:84%
And some people were lucky
because of their position

00:33:48.190 --> 00:33:51.010 align:middle line:84%
or there's some skills
that they have borne,

00:33:51.010 --> 00:33:55.900 align:middle line:84%
and they began to
become more prosperous.

00:33:55.900 --> 00:34:00.310 align:middle line:84%
And then you had the
rise of higher classes.

00:34:00.310 --> 00:34:02.650 align:middle line:84%
And therefore you
have the lower class,

00:34:02.650 --> 00:34:04.310 align:middle line:90%
and that's where it begins--

00:34:04.310 --> 00:34:05.110 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:34:05.110 --> 00:34:07.270 align:middle line:84%
>>TARPEY: --the
accumulation of wealth.

00:34:07.270 --> 00:34:09.199 align:middle line:84%
And they begin to
worship the sun,

00:34:09.199 --> 00:34:12.620 align:middle line:84%
whereas the ancients
worshipped the Milky Way.

00:34:12.620 --> 00:34:14.949 align:middle line:84%
It was wide across
the sky at night.

00:34:14.949 --> 00:34:18.040 align:middle line:84%
But the civilization's
like the sun

00:34:18.040 --> 00:34:22.840 align:middle line:84%
because the only thing you
can see in the sky is the sun.

00:34:22.840 --> 00:34:26.267 align:middle line:84%
And so the king likes
the symbol of the sun.

00:34:26.267 --> 00:34:27.850 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Well,
egoically, it serves--

00:34:27.850 --> 00:34:28.970 align:middle line:90%
>>TARPEY: Yeah, ego.

00:34:28.970 --> 00:34:31.220 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Wear a little
crown, sun crown on your head.

00:34:31.220 --> 00:34:35.914 align:middle line:84%
>>TARPEY: Only see me like Louis
XIV, the sun king, [FRENCH]..

00:34:35.914 --> 00:34:36.714 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:34:36.714 --> 00:34:38.110 align:middle line:90%
>>TARPEY: I am the state.

00:34:38.110 --> 00:34:38.713 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: And holy cow--

00:34:38.713 --> 00:34:39.100 align:middle line:90%
>>TARPEY: I am the whole thing.

00:34:39.100 --> 00:34:41.100 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: --talk about
history repeating itself,

00:34:41.100 --> 00:34:42.622 align:middle line:84%
I think we're
experiencing the same.

00:34:42.622 --> 00:34:44.039 align:middle line:84%
>>TARPEY: We're
in that same time.

00:34:44.039 --> 00:34:46.505 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: The state
is me, l'état est moi.

00:34:46.505 --> 00:34:48.580 align:middle line:84%
>>TARPEY: And I find
it in Chinese history

00:34:48.580 --> 00:34:53.100 align:middle line:84%
over and over again in the Xia
dynasty, the first dynasty,

00:34:53.100 --> 00:34:54.429 align:middle line:90%
[CHINESE].

00:34:54.429 --> 00:34:58.930 align:middle line:84%
And then in the next dynasty,
the Shang dynasty, [CHINESE]..

00:34:58.930 --> 00:35:05.440 align:middle line:84%
And it all became about them
and their life in the palace.

00:35:05.440 --> 00:35:10.480 align:middle line:84%
And the people didn't matter
anymore because they became

00:35:10.480 --> 00:35:15.572 align:middle line:84%
the people who deserve, not the
people who serve, "de-serve."

00:35:15.572 --> 00:35:16.655 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: "De-serve," yes.

00:35:16.655 --> 00:35:18.050 align:middle line:90%
>>TARPEY: And that's the tenor.

00:35:18.050 --> 00:35:21.070 align:middle line:84%
And many ancient
civilizations presented

00:35:21.070 --> 00:35:26.750 align:middle line:84%
us ways to stop that influence,
that thing from happening.

00:35:26.750 --> 00:35:30.100 align:middle line:84%
And so you go down to
Peru and you see the Maya,

00:35:30.100 --> 00:35:34.540 align:middle line:84%
and you see their pyramids,
and especially Peru

00:35:34.540 --> 00:35:37.510 align:middle line:84%
because the pyramids
had-- well, the Maya too.

00:35:37.510 --> 00:35:40.840 align:middle line:84%
They had a central
pyramid and then two

00:35:40.840 --> 00:35:45.670 align:middle line:90%
on the side, the triad monument.

00:35:45.670 --> 00:35:48.160 align:middle line:84%
And you notice
especially in Peru,

00:35:48.160 --> 00:35:53.110 align:middle line:84%
one side is more elaborate,
and the other side isn't.

00:35:53.110 --> 00:35:55.710 align:middle line:84%
In other words,
the upper classes--

00:35:55.710 --> 00:35:59.920 align:middle line:84%
the mediating place
was the middle temple.

00:35:59.920 --> 00:36:05.500 align:middle line:84%
And the two arms represented the
poorer and the richer classes.

00:36:05.500 --> 00:36:09.307 align:middle line:84%
And the way they redistributed
the wealth was the rich people

00:36:09.307 --> 00:36:10.390 align:middle line:90%
would pay for the parties.

00:36:10.390 --> 00:36:13.360 align:middle line:90%


00:36:13.360 --> 00:36:15.250 align:middle line:84%
And you found
loads of offerings,

00:36:15.250 --> 00:36:16.660 align:middle line:90%
and there were feasts.

00:36:16.660 --> 00:36:19.660 align:middle line:84%
And that's how the
wealth was redistributed.

00:36:19.660 --> 00:36:23.780 align:middle line:84%
And that's how some
civilization achieved success.

00:36:23.780 --> 00:36:27.910 align:middle line:84%
And that's what I look for when
I study history, like at Caral,

00:36:27.910 --> 00:36:31.390 align:middle line:90%
C-A-R-A-L, in Peru--

00:36:31.390 --> 00:36:32.950 align:middle line:90%
no weapons found.

00:36:32.950 --> 00:36:37.630 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Well, it's
interesting because more recent

00:36:37.630 --> 00:36:39.340 align:middle line:84%
archaeological
digs and such have

00:36:39.340 --> 00:36:42.220 align:middle line:84%
found gleaming
cities in the Amazon

00:36:42.220 --> 00:36:45.880 align:middle line:84%
that were just grown over
and many, many, many pyramids

00:36:45.880 --> 00:36:47.110 align:middle line:90%
in the Amazon.

00:36:47.110 --> 00:36:49.180 align:middle line:84%
They're just buried
under the sands of time.

00:36:49.180 --> 00:36:50.590 align:middle line:90%
And this is all over the planet.

00:36:50.590 --> 00:36:51.550 align:middle line:90%
>>TARPEY: Yes.

00:36:51.550 --> 00:36:57.170 align:middle line:84%
And according to the Indian,
the Asian Indian sources,

00:36:57.170 --> 00:37:01.570 align:middle line:84%
the yugas, we are way
older than we think we are.

00:37:01.570 --> 00:37:02.380 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Oh, yes.

00:37:02.380 --> 00:37:04.960 align:middle line:84%
>>TARPEY: Because a lot
has been rubbed out,

00:37:04.960 --> 00:37:09.910 align:middle line:84%
like Atlantis is moving
underneath Europe now.

00:37:09.910 --> 00:37:13.360 align:middle line:84%
And they call it
Adria, A-D-R-I-A.

00:37:13.360 --> 00:37:19.090 align:middle line:84%
And Mu/Lemuria is now underneath
the United States and South

00:37:19.090 --> 00:37:20.440 align:middle line:90%
America.

00:37:20.440 --> 00:37:24.130 align:middle line:84%
And that's why Edgar
Cayce said Mount Shasta is

00:37:24.130 --> 00:37:28.960 align:middle line:84%
such a special place, because
of the crystals in the caves

00:37:28.960 --> 00:37:32.440 align:middle line:90%
under there from Mu/Lemuria.

00:37:32.440 --> 00:37:33.610 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Interesting.

00:37:33.610 --> 00:37:37.690 align:middle line:84%
So essentially you're
saying that sunken landmass,

00:37:37.690 --> 00:37:39.700 align:middle line:84%
that tectonic plate
has moved under--

00:37:39.700 --> 00:37:40.120 align:middle line:90%
>>TARPEY: Has moved under.

00:37:40.120 --> 00:37:40.795 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: --ours in California.

00:37:40.795 --> 00:37:41.595 align:middle line:90%
>>TARPEY: Yes.

00:37:41.595 --> 00:37:42.500 align:middle line:90%
We are now Mu--

00:37:42.500 --> 00:37:43.180 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:37:43.180 --> 00:37:45.360 align:middle line:84%
>>TARPEY: --the vibration
coming up from the bottom.

00:37:45.360 --> 00:37:46.160 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: OK.

00:37:46.160 --> 00:37:48.820 align:middle line:84%
Now that's the first time I've
heard anyone state it that way.

00:37:48.820 --> 00:37:50.215 align:middle line:84%
I have not been
exposed to that before.

00:37:50.215 --> 00:37:51.010 align:middle line:90%
>>TARPEY: Yeah, yeah.

00:37:51.010 --> 00:37:51.810 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: OK.

00:37:51.810 --> 00:37:53.605 align:middle line:84%
So that gives me a
greater understanding

00:37:53.605 --> 00:37:56.200 align:middle line:84%
of why everybody keeps
saying California

00:37:56.200 --> 00:37:57.870 align:middle line:90%
is the new Mu or Lemuria.

00:37:57.870 --> 00:38:01.150 align:middle line:84%
>>TARPEY: And I realized
it when I went to Lima.

00:38:01.150 --> 00:38:03.970 align:middle line:84%
Because in order to
get to the beach,

00:38:03.970 --> 00:38:07.390 align:middle line:84%
you have to walk
down 300, 400 steps

00:38:07.390 --> 00:38:09.440 align:middle line:90%
because it's constantly rising.

00:38:09.440 --> 00:38:10.240 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: OK.

00:38:10.240 --> 00:38:13.990 align:middle line:84%
>>TARPEY: Our mountain ranges
can be seen, the Rockies

00:38:13.990 --> 00:38:16.270 align:middle line:90%
and also the Andes.

00:38:16.270 --> 00:38:18.200 align:middle line:84%
It's all being
pushed and folded.

00:38:18.200 --> 00:38:19.000 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: OK.

00:38:19.000 --> 00:38:21.650 align:middle line:90%
Now let's go back to Atlantis.

00:38:21.650 --> 00:38:22.450 align:middle line:90%
>>TARPEY: Yes.

00:38:22.450 --> 00:38:25.720 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Because
Edgar Cayce said that

00:38:25.720 --> 00:38:28.240 align:middle line:84%
within a reasonable period
of time, not that distant

00:38:28.240 --> 00:38:31.180 align:middle line:84%
in the future, that
Atlantis would rise again.

00:38:31.180 --> 00:38:34.660 align:middle line:84%
Now other seers
have also validated

00:38:34.660 --> 00:38:36.140 align:middle line:90%
that Atlanta will rise again.

00:38:36.140 --> 00:38:36.940 align:middle line:90%
>>TARPEY: Yes.

00:38:36.940 --> 00:38:43.420 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: But how does this work
if it's tucked under Europe?

00:38:43.420 --> 00:38:46.060 align:middle line:84%
>>TARPEY: Atlantis
will rise again.

00:38:46.060 --> 00:38:46.887 align:middle line:90%
I think it's more--

00:38:46.887 --> 00:38:47.520 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Do they
mean metaphorically?

00:38:47.520 --> 00:38:49.390 align:middle line:90%
>>TARPEY: --the technology.

00:38:49.390 --> 00:38:50.200 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: OK.

00:38:50.200 --> 00:38:52.600 align:middle line:84%
Because he was saying the
landmass would rise again.

00:38:52.600 --> 00:38:54.980 align:middle line:90%
>>TARPEY: Yes, yes, yes.

00:38:54.980 --> 00:38:57.580 align:middle line:90%
But Atlantis is here also.

00:38:57.580 --> 00:39:02.080 align:middle line:84%
Because what happens when
a civilization goes down,

00:39:02.080 --> 00:39:05.140 align:middle line:84%
the first to run
are the shamans.

00:39:05.140 --> 00:39:06.080 align:middle line:90%
Get out of there.

00:39:06.080 --> 00:39:06.580 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:39:06.580 --> 00:39:07.760 align:middle line:84%
>>TARPEY: Because
people get into--

00:39:07.760 --> 00:39:09.510 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: After the
elephants and everyone

00:39:09.510 --> 00:39:11.390 align:middle line:90%
else that have some sense.

00:39:11.390 --> 00:39:12.190 align:middle line:90%
>>TARPEY: Yes.

00:39:12.190 --> 00:39:16.720 align:middle line:84%
Because they know a society
is getting into group think.

00:39:16.720 --> 00:39:17.590 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:39:17.590 --> 00:39:19.750 align:middle line:84%
>>TARPEY: I saw that most
clearly when I watched

00:39:19.750 --> 00:39:23.830 align:middle line:84%
the movie "The Crucible"
by Arthur Miller,

00:39:23.830 --> 00:39:26.770 align:middle line:84%
what happened during the witch
trials when they were just

00:39:26.770 --> 00:39:30.700 align:middle line:84%
accusing everybody, and you
could not present any evidence,

00:39:30.700 --> 00:39:31.810 align:middle line:90%
and they were just--

00:39:31.810 --> 00:39:36.220 align:middle line:84%
and the hopelessness that
happens to a society,

00:39:36.220 --> 00:39:37.668 align:middle line:90%
it is huge.

00:39:37.668 --> 00:39:39.460 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: But Raymond,
it feels like that's

00:39:39.460 --> 00:39:40.200 align:middle line:90%
happening right now.

00:39:40.200 --> 00:39:40.720 align:middle line:90%
>>TARPEY: Yeah.

00:39:40.720 --> 00:39:42.510 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And it's happening
all over the planet.

00:39:42.510 --> 00:39:43.310 align:middle line:90%
>>TARPEY: Yes.

00:39:43.310 --> 00:39:45.640 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: In the US, you
have such polarized factions

00:39:45.640 --> 00:39:48.250 align:middle line:84%
of people who used to be
able to discuss things.

00:39:48.250 --> 00:39:52.030 align:middle line:84%
Like even if it was
impolite in polite society

00:39:52.030 --> 00:39:55.057 align:middle line:84%
to discuss religion and
politics, you could do it,

00:39:55.057 --> 00:39:56.890 align:middle line:84%
and you wouldn't end
up bloodied at the end,

00:39:56.890 --> 00:39:59.950 align:middle line:84%
or walking out, or
in a field of hatred.

00:39:59.950 --> 00:40:03.280 align:middle line:84%
Now we're so polarized
that can't even take place.

00:40:03.280 --> 00:40:04.870 align:middle line:90%
>>TARPEY: Yes.

00:40:04.870 --> 00:40:06.700 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: But it's
true all over,

00:40:06.700 --> 00:40:10.690 align:middle line:84%
this phenomena of
turning to institution

00:40:10.690 --> 00:40:14.900 align:middle line:84%
and strong arm people is
happening all over the planet.

00:40:14.900 --> 00:40:17.415 align:middle line:84%
>>TARPEY: And because they're
all civilizations and that

00:40:17.415 --> 00:40:23.770 align:middle line:84%
moderns civilizations, the
ones that we know, are--

00:40:23.770 --> 00:40:26.010 align:middle line:90%
it's really like a spear.

00:40:26.010 --> 00:40:28.800 align:middle line:84%
But the religion
is the snake that

00:40:28.800 --> 00:40:34.680 align:middle line:84%
wraps itself around the spear,
and moves along, and attacks.

00:40:34.680 --> 00:40:35.640 align:middle line:90%
And it's really--

00:40:35.640 --> 00:40:37.720 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And it's in league
with the politics in the world

00:40:37.720 --> 00:40:38.040 align:middle line:90%
right now.

00:40:38.040 --> 00:40:39.015 align:middle line:84%
>>TARPEY: It's in league
with the politics.

00:40:39.015 --> 00:40:39.900 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:40:39.900 --> 00:40:43.200 align:middle line:84%
>>TARPEY: And so here, you'll
have religious backing,

00:40:43.200 --> 00:40:44.790 align:middle line:90%
certain religious backing.

00:40:44.790 --> 00:40:47.790 align:middle line:84%
And it's usually
right-wing religious people

00:40:47.790 --> 00:40:51.840 align:middle line:90%
who believe in an idol.

00:40:51.840 --> 00:40:57.510 align:middle line:84%
And when I talk to people
in the Mayan calendar,

00:40:57.510 --> 00:41:00.270 align:middle line:84%
using the vehicle of
the Mayan calendar,

00:41:00.270 --> 00:41:04.590 align:middle line:84%
I try to tell them the
clear truth of history.

00:41:04.590 --> 00:41:09.960 align:middle line:84%
And the Bible and any book by
its own rule cannot portend

00:41:09.960 --> 00:41:14.250 align:middle line:84%
to be the only word of God
because it's made by the hand

00:41:14.250 --> 00:41:15.240 align:middle line:90%
of man.

00:41:15.240 --> 00:41:17.670 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: The Bible
itself is how many--

00:41:17.670 --> 00:41:21.940 align:middle line:84%
over 20,000 renditions
in terms of translations,

00:41:21.940 --> 00:41:23.730 align:middle line:90%
interpretations, and edits.

00:41:23.730 --> 00:41:24.930 align:middle line:90%
>>TARPEY: Yes, yes.

00:41:24.930 --> 00:41:26.400 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: So, yes.

00:41:26.400 --> 00:41:27.960 align:middle line:84%
>>TARPEY: So what
they did was get

00:41:27.960 --> 00:41:30.180 align:middle line:84%
rid of everybody
else's idol, but kept

00:41:30.180 --> 00:41:32.880 align:middle line:90%
the biggest one for themselves.

00:41:32.880 --> 00:41:34.180 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: And this is classic.

00:41:34.180 --> 00:41:35.250 align:middle line:90%
It happens.

00:41:35.250 --> 00:41:38.790 align:middle line:84%
Now let's-- I want to broaden it
out and drill down at the same

00:41:38.790 --> 00:41:39.730 align:middle line:90%
time.

00:41:39.730 --> 00:41:43.170 align:middle line:84%
So we're in this
state now globally

00:41:43.170 --> 00:41:48.070 align:middle line:84%
of intensifying energy and
polarization between people.

00:41:48.070 --> 00:41:48.870 align:middle line:90%
>>TARPEY: Yes.

00:41:48.870 --> 00:41:51.690 align:middle line:90%


00:41:51.690 --> 00:41:55.237 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Which is interesting,
because a study was done--

00:41:55.237 --> 00:41:57.570 align:middle line:84%
and I don't have it in front
of me so I can't source it,

00:41:57.570 --> 00:41:58.820 align:middle line:90%
but this was the nature of it.

00:41:58.820 --> 00:42:00.960 align:middle line:90%
And this is relatively recently.

00:42:00.960 --> 00:42:05.130 align:middle line:84%
It was done to look at
the social proclivities

00:42:05.130 --> 00:42:09.928 align:middle line:84%
and beliefs of liberal groups
and conservative groups.

00:42:09.928 --> 00:42:11.470 align:middle line:84%
And it asked questions
that had to do

00:42:11.470 --> 00:42:16.520 align:middle line:84%
with how societies ordered
preferences and so forth.

00:42:16.520 --> 00:42:19.653 align:middle line:84%
Doing the test straight
up, the conservatives

00:42:19.653 --> 00:42:21.570 align:middle line:84%
answered as you would
expect, and the liberals

00:42:21.570 --> 00:42:23.230 align:middle line:90%
answered as you would expect.

00:42:23.230 --> 00:42:24.870 align:middle line:84%
But then they were
asked to run things

00:42:24.870 --> 00:42:26.335 align:middle line:90%
through the opposite lens.

00:42:26.335 --> 00:42:27.960 align:middle line:84%
So they asked a group
of conservatives,

00:42:27.960 --> 00:42:31.980 align:middle line:84%
now imagine that everything
has been provided you.

00:42:31.980 --> 00:42:36.480 align:middle line:84%
You're living a life that
is full and has plenty.

00:42:36.480 --> 00:42:39.870 align:middle line:84%
You don't have to struggle
for your basic needs anymore.

00:42:39.870 --> 00:42:42.150 align:middle line:84%
Now with that feeling
and understanding,

00:42:42.150 --> 00:42:43.670 align:middle line:90%
we want you to take this test.

00:42:43.670 --> 00:42:45.630 align:middle line:90%
They took the same test.

00:42:45.630 --> 00:42:48.210 align:middle line:90%
They answered like the liberals.

00:42:48.210 --> 00:42:51.100 align:middle line:84%
They did the exact same thing
with the liberals and said,

00:42:51.100 --> 00:42:54.450 align:middle line:90%
now imagine there's not enough.

00:42:54.450 --> 00:42:57.090 align:middle line:84%
Maybe you're struggling to
pay your next month's bills

00:42:57.090 --> 00:42:59.580 align:middle line:84%
or whatever it was that
they felt threatened by.

00:42:59.580 --> 00:43:02.040 align:middle line:84%
The liberals answered
like conservatives.

00:43:02.040 --> 00:43:05.520 align:middle line:84%
So conservation
and conservatism is

00:43:05.520 --> 00:43:11.560 align:middle line:84%
based on fear of either losing,
letting go, loss of some kind.

00:43:11.560 --> 00:43:12.360 align:middle line:90%
>>TARPEY: Yeah.

00:43:12.360 --> 00:43:19.440 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So it appears as this
rabid polarization of views

00:43:19.440 --> 00:43:22.770 align:middle line:84%
happens that there is
a huge amount of fear

00:43:22.770 --> 00:43:26.910 align:middle line:84%
driving it and certainly driving
the conservative half of it

00:43:26.910 --> 00:43:29.490 align:middle line:90%
by nature of the word in itself.

00:43:29.490 --> 00:43:30.300 align:middle line:90%
What's happening?

00:43:30.300 --> 00:43:32.040 align:middle line:84%
What's influencing
and driving this?

00:43:32.040 --> 00:43:35.580 align:middle line:84%
Is it our disconnect from
nature that's so severe now?

00:43:35.580 --> 00:43:36.425 align:middle line:90%
What is it?

00:43:36.425 --> 00:43:37.800 align:middle line:84%
>>TARPEY: We're
in our own minds,

00:43:37.800 --> 00:43:40.530 align:middle line:84%
and we don't know
what enough is.

00:43:40.530 --> 00:43:43.665 align:middle line:84%
I remember the movie "Key Largo"
years ago with Humphrey Bogart

00:43:43.665 --> 00:43:45.750 align:middle line:90%
and Edward G. Robinson.

00:43:45.750 --> 00:43:49.770 align:middle line:84%
Edward G. Robinson played Al
Capone hiding away in Florida.

00:43:49.770 --> 00:43:54.240 align:middle line:84%
And the fellow in
the wheelchair--

00:43:54.240 --> 00:43:55.840 align:middle line:90%
I forget his name--

00:43:55.840 --> 00:44:00.310 align:middle line:84%
but he asked Al Capone in the
movie, why are you doing this?

00:44:00.310 --> 00:44:03.930 align:middle line:84%
Why are you controlling
everybody and using everybody?

00:44:03.930 --> 00:44:05.400 align:middle line:90%
Don't you have enough?

00:44:05.400 --> 00:44:07.290 align:middle line:90%
You have everything.

00:44:07.290 --> 00:44:11.640 align:middle line:84%
And Bogart answered the
question with that usual sneer.

00:44:11.640 --> 00:44:14.280 align:middle line:84%
And he said, I
know what he wants.

00:44:14.280 --> 00:44:15.540 align:middle line:90%
He wants more.

00:44:15.540 --> 00:44:19.225 align:middle line:84%
And Capone said,
that's it, more.

00:44:19.225 --> 00:44:21.540 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Well, that happened
in a more recent film

00:44:21.540 --> 00:44:24.660 align:middle line:84%
too having to do with the story
of the kidnapping of J. Paul

00:44:24.660 --> 00:44:26.598 align:middle line:90%
Getty's Grandson.

00:44:26.598 --> 00:44:27.890 align:middle line:90%
And he wouldn't give the money.

00:44:27.890 --> 00:44:29.010 align:middle line:90%
>>TARPEY: Yes, yes.

00:44:29.010 --> 00:44:33.390 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And so finally
someone said, basically you

00:44:33.390 --> 00:44:37.350 align:middle line:84%
have more money than God, as
a saying, more money than God.

00:44:37.350 --> 00:44:41.850 align:middle line:84%
He had palaces filled with
the most exquisite artworks

00:44:41.850 --> 00:44:45.780 align:middle line:84%
and antiques from around
the world, and artifacts.

00:44:45.780 --> 00:44:48.000 align:middle line:90%
And they said, what is it?

00:44:48.000 --> 00:44:48.970 align:middle line:90%
Don't you have enough?

00:44:48.970 --> 00:44:50.520 align:middle line:84%
And he said, there's
never enough.

00:44:50.520 --> 00:44:52.000 align:middle line:90%
>>TARPEY: It's never enough.

00:44:52.000 --> 00:44:54.990 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So now if
these are our gods,

00:44:54.990 --> 00:44:59.790 align:middle line:84%
these men in this world, just
like the Chinese empirical

00:44:59.790 --> 00:45:02.970 align:middle line:84%
system to want to be like
the emperor, like god,

00:45:02.970 --> 00:45:05.220 align:middle line:84%
same in the rest of the world
to be like a movie star,

00:45:05.220 --> 00:45:08.250 align:middle line:84%
like a well-known politician
or business entrepreneur

00:45:08.250 --> 00:45:11.730 align:middle line:84%
that's extraordinarily wealthy,
and for them enough is never

00:45:11.730 --> 00:45:12.870 align:middle line:90%
enough--

00:45:12.870 --> 00:45:16.758 align:middle line:84%
and if those are actually
our cultural gods--

00:45:16.758 --> 00:45:18.050 align:middle line:90%
>>TARPEY: And we're feeding it.

00:45:18.050 --> 00:45:19.960 align:middle line:90%
We're feeding it all the time.

00:45:19.960 --> 00:45:23.300 align:middle line:84%
And we have no more
effective system

00:45:23.300 --> 00:45:25.520 align:middle line:90%
of redistributing the wealth.

00:45:25.520 --> 00:45:27.870 align:middle line:90%
That's what makes society run.

00:45:27.870 --> 00:45:30.200 align:middle line:90%
We have a distribution problem.

00:45:30.200 --> 00:45:32.690 align:middle line:84%
And we've had it in
every civilization.

00:45:32.690 --> 00:45:35.670 align:middle line:84%
They all fall for
the same reason.

00:45:35.670 --> 00:45:38.490 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: It seems a pattern,
a pattern in human nature.

00:45:38.490 --> 00:45:40.200 align:middle line:90%
>>TARPEY: Yes, yes.

00:45:40.200 --> 00:45:49.220 align:middle line:84%
And in the year 494 BC in Rome,
the soldiers refused to fight.

00:45:49.220 --> 00:45:53.360 align:middle line:84%
That's the only thing
at the grassroots level,

00:45:53.360 --> 00:45:58.280 align:middle line:84%
or the people walk
out of Rome and said,

00:45:58.280 --> 00:46:00.290 align:middle line:84%
we're forming a
different country

00:46:00.290 --> 00:46:05.060 align:middle line:84%
because the rich have controlled
everything, the patricians.

00:46:05.060 --> 00:46:06.770 align:middle line:90%
And the plebes walked out.

00:46:06.770 --> 00:46:11.900 align:middle line:84%
That's how you get a republic,
because the people at the grass

00:46:11.900 --> 00:46:15.320 align:middle line:84%
roots have to say
enough is enough--

00:46:15.320 --> 00:46:16.185 align:middle line:90%
enough is enough.

00:46:16.185 --> 00:46:17.810 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Is the US,
for example, still

00:46:17.810 --> 00:46:20.025 align:middle line:84%
a republic in the truest
sense of the word?

00:46:20.025 --> 00:46:22.505 align:middle line:84%
>>TARPEY: The US has
never been a republic.

00:46:22.505 --> 00:46:23.630 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: OK, explain that.

00:46:23.630 --> 00:46:24.797 align:middle line:90%
>>TARPEY: It has never been.

00:46:24.797 --> 00:46:28.130 align:middle line:90%
I have to tell the truth about--

00:46:28.130 --> 00:46:32.270 align:middle line:84%
because they've been educated
with the books of history

00:46:32.270 --> 00:46:34.280 align:middle line:90%
made by the empire.

00:46:34.280 --> 00:46:35.710 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: This is true.

00:46:35.710 --> 00:46:38.390 align:middle line:84%
>>TARPEY: And education
is Latin also.

00:46:38.390 --> 00:46:41.180 align:middle line:90%
E means E-X, to go out.

00:46:41.180 --> 00:46:43.820 align:middle line:90%
D-U-C is the word for leader.

00:46:43.820 --> 00:46:46.190 align:middle line:90%
Lead out, not stuff in.

00:46:46.190 --> 00:46:48.000 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Education,
and it's all stuff in.

00:46:48.000 --> 00:46:50.000 align:middle line:84%
>>TARPEY: They are stuffing
you with information

00:46:50.000 --> 00:46:54.080 align:middle line:84%
that they want you to have
so they can pull the string.

00:46:54.080 --> 00:46:58.340 align:middle line:84%
And it has to be
really tight in order

00:46:58.340 --> 00:47:02.870 align:middle line:84%
to get you to go out and kill
people you never even met.

00:47:02.870 --> 00:47:06.320 align:middle line:84%
They need a tight
program with religion

00:47:06.320 --> 00:47:09.105 align:middle line:84%
and political information
that has been warped.

00:47:09.105 --> 00:47:10.550 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: And belief-- belief.

00:47:10.550 --> 00:47:12.490 align:middle line:90%
>>TARPEY: Belief system, yeah.

00:47:12.490 --> 00:47:15.380 align:middle line:84%
There's our essential
human problem.

00:47:15.380 --> 00:47:20.940 align:middle line:84%
And we're repeating, but every
repeat is an opportunity.

00:47:20.940 --> 00:47:21.740 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: OK.

00:47:21.740 --> 00:47:24.250 align:middle line:84%
So let's look at it from a
Mayan and a Mayan calendar

00:47:24.250 --> 00:47:25.310 align:middle line:90%
point of view.

00:47:25.310 --> 00:47:26.810 align:middle line:84%
But different people
are watching it

00:47:26.810 --> 00:47:29.210 align:middle line:84%
from astrological
points of view,

00:47:29.210 --> 00:47:32.060 align:middle line:84%
but let's talk about the Mayan
point of view and this period

00:47:32.060 --> 00:47:36.710 align:middle line:84%
we're in right now, what
the challenge and danger is,

00:47:36.710 --> 00:47:39.720 align:middle line:84%
and also what the incredible
hidden opportunity is.

00:47:39.720 --> 00:47:40.520 align:middle line:90%
>>TARPEY: Yes.

00:47:40.520 --> 00:47:45.650 align:middle line:84%
Well, the first thing that
comes to mind is the k'atun.

00:47:45.650 --> 00:47:51.080 align:middle line:84%
Since 2012, 2013, we are
in the first 20 years.

00:47:51.080 --> 00:47:55.240 align:middle line:84%
And the number 20 is the other
sacred number of the calendar.

00:47:55.240 --> 00:47:59.240 align:middle line:84%
It means the shaman, but it
also is increment of time,

00:47:59.240 --> 00:48:00.770 align:middle line:90%
of change.

00:48:00.770 --> 00:48:03.270 align:middle line:90%
And each one has a name.

00:48:03.270 --> 00:48:09.410 align:middle line:84%
And we are now in
the name of tun ahau.

00:48:09.410 --> 00:48:12.290 align:middle line:84%
The k'atun-- they
all are named ahau.

00:48:12.290 --> 00:48:14.960 align:middle line:90%
That's the number 20.

00:48:14.960 --> 00:48:17.750 align:middle line:90%
But it's the tun plus the ahau.

00:48:17.750 --> 00:48:24.380 align:middle line:84%
And that k'atun is known
for half scarcity and half

00:48:24.380 --> 00:48:26.875 align:middle line:90%
prosperity.

00:48:26.875 --> 00:48:28.500 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: That's
polarized right there.

00:48:28.500 --> 00:48:30.192 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHTER]

00:48:30.192 --> 00:48:31.040 align:middle line:90%


00:48:31.040 --> 00:48:35.660 align:middle line:84%
>>TARPEY: And then we're
moving in by the year 2032,

00:48:35.660 --> 00:48:41.840 align:middle line:84%
2033 to all is lost,
invasion by foreign powers.

00:48:41.840 --> 00:48:49.970 align:middle line:84%
It's the worst 20 years that
are in the 13 sets of years.

00:48:49.970 --> 00:48:53.420 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Coming up in 2032?

00:48:53.420 --> 00:48:56.240 align:middle line:90%
>>TARPEY: 2032, 2033.

00:48:56.240 --> 00:48:57.680 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: OK.

00:48:57.680 --> 00:49:01.440 align:middle line:84%
>>TARPEY: Reminds
me of 1933, 1932.

00:49:01.440 --> 00:49:02.240 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:49:02.240 --> 00:49:06.590 align:middle line:84%
Is this global, or is
this specific to regions?

00:49:06.590 --> 00:49:09.500 align:middle line:84%
>>TARPEY: For the Maya,
it was their world.

00:49:09.500 --> 00:49:11.390 align:middle line:90%
That's how theirs works.

00:49:11.390 --> 00:49:14.475 align:middle line:90%
And it's to be considered.

00:49:14.475 --> 00:49:17.840 align:middle line:84%
And so I take it in the
context where it's in,

00:49:17.840 --> 00:49:19.520 align:middle line:84%
but it looks like
the whole world

00:49:19.520 --> 00:49:21.560 align:middle line:90%
is doing the same thing now.

00:49:21.560 --> 00:49:23.060 align:middle line:90%
Dictators are on the rise.

00:49:23.060 --> 00:49:24.310 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes, absolutely.

00:49:24.310 --> 00:49:25.560 align:middle line:90%
>>TARPEY: India, look at them.

00:49:25.560 --> 00:49:26.170 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah, yeah.

00:49:26.170 --> 00:49:27.080 align:middle line:90%
>>TARPEY: Yeah.

00:49:27.080 --> 00:49:29.100 align:middle line:84%
I just had a dream of
Palestine last night.

00:49:29.100 --> 00:49:29.900 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Oh.

00:49:29.900 --> 00:49:32.535 align:middle line:90%
>>TARPEY: And it scared me.

00:49:32.535 --> 00:49:35.160 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: I'm so sensitive about
that issue, having been there.

00:49:35.160 --> 00:49:35.960 align:middle line:90%
>>TARPEY: I know.

00:49:35.960 --> 00:49:37.250 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: What did you see?

00:49:37.250 --> 00:49:40.480 align:middle line:84%
>>TARPEY: Oh, I
saw hopelessness.

00:49:40.480 --> 00:49:42.320 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: As if
it isn't already.

00:49:42.320 --> 00:49:46.070 align:middle line:84%
>>TARPEY: And I saw people
digging caves to escape

00:49:46.070 --> 00:49:48.860 align:middle line:90%
underneath because it's--

00:49:48.860 --> 00:49:51.860 align:middle line:90%


00:49:51.860 --> 00:49:55.830 align:middle line:84%
things are happening there that
are making people second class.

00:49:55.830 --> 00:49:56.630 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Oh.

00:49:56.630 --> 00:49:57.455 align:middle line:90%
>>TARPEY: Second-class citizens.

00:49:57.455 --> 00:49:58.413 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: It's so dire.

00:49:58.413 --> 00:50:01.675 align:middle line:84%
>>TARPEY: And it's-- the
hopelessness, I feel it.

00:50:01.675 --> 00:50:03.800 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: I've never been
more depressed in my life

00:50:03.800 --> 00:50:08.120 align:middle line:84%
spontaneously than walking
through the wall into Ramallah

00:50:08.120 --> 00:50:11.270 align:middle line:84%
and the rubble, the
devastation-- not a plant, not

00:50:11.270 --> 00:50:12.080 align:middle line:90%
a tree.

00:50:12.080 --> 00:50:16.550 align:middle line:84%
And the first person I saw was
a man with these dark, dark eyes

00:50:16.550 --> 00:50:19.100 align:middle line:84%
holding an orange in
one hand and used baby

00:50:19.100 --> 00:50:21.700 align:middle line:84%
socks in the other,
trying to sell them

00:50:21.700 --> 00:50:23.550 align:middle line:90%
because unemployment is so--

00:50:23.550 --> 00:50:24.350 align:middle line:90%
>>TARPEY: Yeah.

00:50:24.350 --> 00:50:25.280 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:50:25.280 --> 00:50:27.080 align:middle line:90%
>>TARPEY: And the whole Bible--

00:50:27.080 --> 00:50:30.500 align:middle line:84%
if you look at the Old
Testament of the Bible,

00:50:30.500 --> 00:50:38.000 align:middle line:84%
it's probably a group of a
military group like Pizarro

00:50:38.000 --> 00:50:40.610 align:middle line:84%
and Cortes that
came from Babylon

00:50:40.610 --> 00:50:43.790 align:middle line:84%
with a lot of political
savvy from after thousands

00:50:43.790 --> 00:50:45.710 align:middle line:90%
of years of war.

00:50:45.710 --> 00:50:48.050 align:middle line:90%
And they came with a trick--

00:50:48.050 --> 00:50:51.680 align:middle line:90%
God said your land is my land.

00:50:51.680 --> 00:50:55.080 align:middle line:84%
And we've been operating on
that for thousands of years.

00:50:55.080 --> 00:50:55.880 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: OK.

00:50:55.880 --> 00:50:59.840 align:middle line:84%
So you mentioned earlier on--
and let's get into this part

00:50:59.840 --> 00:51:00.640 align:middle line:90%
of it--

00:51:00.640 --> 00:51:03.770 align:middle line:90%
that these cycles persist.

00:51:03.770 --> 00:51:07.370 align:middle line:84%
And they persist as a
result of, on one hand,

00:51:07.370 --> 00:51:11.030 align:middle line:84%
a lack of our ability to
expand, and grow, and learn

00:51:11.030 --> 00:51:12.770 align:middle line:90%
on a psychospiritual level.

00:51:12.770 --> 00:51:14.720 align:middle line:84%
So we keep repeating
these mistakes,

00:51:14.720 --> 00:51:17.870 align:middle line:84%
that when given something
and desiring more, and more,

00:51:17.870 --> 00:51:20.630 align:middle line:84%
and more, you end up in
corrupt cultures globally.

00:51:20.630 --> 00:51:24.590 align:middle line:84%
And then it seems that either
that culture, that civilization

00:51:24.590 --> 00:51:26.930 align:middle line:84%
will fall, or there
can actually be

00:51:26.930 --> 00:51:30.770 align:middle line:84%
a situation such as a deluge,
which has happened repeatedly,

00:51:30.770 --> 00:51:32.567 align:middle line:90%
wipe it all out.

00:51:32.567 --> 00:51:33.650 align:middle line:90%
There's good news in that.

00:51:33.650 --> 00:51:35.660 align:middle line:84%
I mean, there's still
some hopeful news in that.

00:51:35.660 --> 00:51:37.700 align:middle line:84%
But wipe it out,
start clean again.

00:51:37.700 --> 00:51:38.895 align:middle line:84%
>>TARPEY: But you don't want
to go through that period.

00:51:38.895 --> 00:51:40.090 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: You don't want
to go through it again.

00:51:40.090 --> 00:51:42.800 align:middle line:84%
We don't want that, to
go through this repeat.

00:51:42.800 --> 00:51:46.790 align:middle line:84%
And it seems that it all has
to do with what you said.

00:51:46.790 --> 00:51:49.580 align:middle line:84%
We become arrogant, lack
humility, put ourselves

00:51:49.580 --> 00:51:52.040 align:middle line:84%
above everything, live
totally out of balance

00:51:52.040 --> 00:51:56.010 align:middle line:84%
to scale with everything that
the Earth's intelligence feeds

00:51:56.010 --> 00:51:56.810 align:middle line:90%
us.

00:51:56.810 --> 00:51:59.330 align:middle line:84%
>>TARPEY: And each person
has their responsibility

00:51:59.330 --> 00:52:01.520 align:middle line:90%
of work in this era.

00:52:01.520 --> 00:52:05.390 align:middle line:84%
My responsibility is through
the Mayan calendar, where

00:52:05.390 --> 00:52:08.480 align:middle line:84%
I try to give people
the clear truth,

00:52:08.480 --> 00:52:13.370 align:middle line:84%
and I try to explain
to them that all of us

00:52:13.370 --> 00:52:16.970 align:middle line:84%
are charged to become the
shaman, every single person.

00:52:16.970 --> 00:52:17.960 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:52:17.960 --> 00:52:20.870 align:middle line:84%
>>TARPEY: And we're all
given unique gifts, gifts

00:52:20.870 --> 00:52:22.910 align:middle line:84%
that are already
explanatory when

00:52:22.910 --> 00:52:24.590 align:middle line:90%
I look at their past history.

00:52:24.590 --> 00:52:27.280 align:middle line:84%
They've already been
doing it, like coyote.

00:52:27.280 --> 00:52:28.080 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHS]

00:52:28.080 --> 00:52:29.270 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:52:29.270 --> 00:52:30.937 align:middle line:84%
>>TARPEY: They've
already been doing it.

00:52:30.937 --> 00:52:33.860 align:middle line:84%
So all I do is
have to just remind

00:52:33.860 --> 00:52:36.710 align:middle line:84%
them of what they studied,
what they've done,

00:52:36.710 --> 00:52:38.780 align:middle line:84%
and then give them
a few techniques.

00:52:38.780 --> 00:52:43.040 align:middle line:84%
And the important thing
is shamanic reading.

00:52:43.040 --> 00:52:47.048 align:middle line:84%
And shamanic reading-- reading
is going down in the world

00:52:47.048 --> 00:52:47.848 align:middle line:90%
because of--

00:52:47.848 --> 00:52:48.940 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Oh, yes.

00:52:48.940 --> 00:52:51.450 align:middle line:84%
>>TARPEY: --the electronic
age, the computer age.

00:52:51.450 --> 00:52:53.700 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: The attention span
has been reduced as well.

00:52:53.700 --> 00:52:55.617 align:middle line:84%
>>TARPEY: And they don't
have the relationship

00:52:55.617 --> 00:52:59.180 align:middle line:84%
with the written word
anymore like people

00:52:59.180 --> 00:53:04.650 align:middle line:84%
of the ancient times
and the respect of it.

00:53:04.650 --> 00:53:09.650 align:middle line:84%
And so when I read a book,
I read it three, four times.

00:53:09.650 --> 00:53:10.760 align:middle line:90%
I thought I knew.

00:53:10.760 --> 00:53:11.990 align:middle line:90%
I didn't know.

00:53:11.990 --> 00:53:13.370 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: How many times--

00:53:13.370 --> 00:53:14.450 align:middle line:90%
bring these over.

00:53:14.450 --> 00:53:16.867 align:middle line:84%
We only have a few minutes
left, but what incredible books

00:53:16.867 --> 00:53:17.825 align:middle line:90%
you've brought with us.

00:53:17.825 --> 00:53:20.665 align:middle line:84%
>>TARPEY: Here's a book I'm
reading about the Kojiki

00:53:20.665 --> 00:53:21.940 align:middle line:90%
Monogatari.

00:53:21.940 --> 00:53:25.430 align:middle line:84%
And it's one of the
oldest books in Japan.

00:53:25.430 --> 00:53:27.530 align:middle line:90%
And I read through it.

00:53:27.530 --> 00:53:30.500 align:middle line:84%
And I look up every
word in Japanese.

00:53:30.500 --> 00:53:33.710 align:middle line:84%
And then I take notes--
oh, this is different.

00:53:33.710 --> 00:53:35.450 align:middle line:90%
Make it personal.

00:53:35.450 --> 00:53:37.040 align:middle line:90%
Make it yours.

00:53:37.040 --> 00:53:40.760 align:middle line:84%
Get in there, because the
truth is not in the words.

00:53:40.760 --> 00:53:43.190 align:middle line:90%
It's in and among the words.

00:53:43.190 --> 00:53:45.200 align:middle line:84%
It's the crystal
thoughts that come

00:53:45.200 --> 00:53:47.660 align:middle line:90%
to you that you write there.

00:53:47.660 --> 00:53:50.630 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And it doesn't matter
what texts you're drawn to--

00:53:50.630 --> 00:53:51.430 align:middle line:90%
>>TARPEY: No.

00:53:51.430 --> 00:53:52.380 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: --that speak to you.

00:53:52.380 --> 00:53:53.180 align:middle line:90%
>>TARPEY: No.

00:53:53.180 --> 00:53:55.910 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: It can be the Quran.

00:53:55.910 --> 00:53:56.960 align:middle line:90%
It can be the Bible.

00:53:56.960 --> 00:53:57.800 align:middle line:90%
It can be the Torah.

00:53:57.800 --> 00:54:01.410 align:middle line:90%
It can be ancient druidic text.

00:54:01.410 --> 00:54:02.261 align:middle line:90%
It doesn't matter.

00:54:02.261 --> 00:54:02.960 align:middle line:84%
>>TARPEY: Because
the Bible has truth.

00:54:02.960 --> 00:54:04.260 align:middle line:90%
They all have truth.

00:54:04.260 --> 00:54:07.460 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: But you have to
really have the discernment

00:54:07.460 --> 00:54:12.140 align:middle line:84%
to excavate the truth for
your level of understanding

00:54:12.140 --> 00:54:13.850 align:middle line:84%
in the moment,
because that's always

00:54:13.850 --> 00:54:15.230 align:middle line:90%
changing and progressing.

00:54:15.230 --> 00:54:17.520 align:middle line:84%
>>TARPEY: And it cannot
only be in one culture.

00:54:17.520 --> 00:54:18.320 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:54:18.320 --> 00:54:21.130 align:middle line:84%
>>TARPEY: I study as many
cultures in the world--

00:54:21.130 --> 00:54:30.020 align:middle line:84%
I study South Sea Island, Japan,
China, the Maya, Rome, England,

00:54:30.020 --> 00:54:35.970 align:middle line:84%
looking at every single empire
and not blaming, no judging.

00:54:35.970 --> 00:54:37.250 align:middle line:90%
We're all the same.

00:54:37.250 --> 00:54:38.050 align:middle line:90%
Our species--

00:54:38.050 --> 00:54:39.190 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: We've all made
these same mistakes.

00:54:39.190 --> 00:54:40.730 align:middle line:84%
>>TARPEY: --has
a huge challenge.

00:54:40.730 --> 00:54:41.530 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:54:41.530 --> 00:54:45.020 align:middle line:84%
>>TARPEY: And it's not
our job to judge anybody.

00:54:45.020 --> 00:54:47.990 align:middle line:84%
It's our job to tell
the truth and our job

00:54:47.990 --> 00:54:52.640 align:middle line:84%
to find that truth so
that we will know which

00:54:52.640 --> 00:54:54.300 align:middle line:90%
one to pick in our government.

00:54:54.300 --> 00:54:55.100 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:54:55.100 --> 00:54:57.500 align:middle line:84%
And what's happened is
because we have created

00:54:57.500 --> 00:55:00.620 align:middle line:84%
a situation where we're not
each getting enough of the pie,

00:55:00.620 --> 00:55:04.700 align:middle line:84%
apparently, that creates
a sense of lack and fear.

00:55:04.700 --> 00:55:10.880 align:middle line:84%
We have started selling out
our own true principles,

00:55:10.880 --> 00:55:14.690 align:middle line:84%
our own ethics in order
to be able to sustain

00:55:14.690 --> 00:55:17.430 align:middle line:84%
our own little, mini
kingdoms of our own.

00:55:17.430 --> 00:55:19.130 align:middle line:84%
And I've said this
when I've done

00:55:19.130 --> 00:55:21.560 align:middle line:84%
lectures at various
conferences, where

00:55:21.560 --> 00:55:24.142 align:middle line:84%
have we been the ones
that have sold ourselves--

00:55:24.142 --> 00:55:25.100 align:middle line:90%
>>TARPEY: That's right.

00:55:25.100 --> 00:55:27.470 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: --and our partners,
and our family, and our friends

00:55:27.470 --> 00:55:27.500 align:middle line:90%
out?

00:55:27.500 --> 00:55:28.430 align:middle line:84%
>>TARPEY: We've all
been part of it.

00:55:28.430 --> 00:55:29.565 align:middle line:90%
I'm to blame too.

00:55:29.565 --> 00:55:30.440 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: We all are.

00:55:30.440 --> 00:55:31.220 align:middle line:90%
>>TARPEY: We're all to blame.

00:55:31.220 --> 00:55:33.380 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And we want to
blame the people at the top.

00:55:33.380 --> 00:55:33.740 align:middle line:90%
>>TARPEY: No.

00:55:33.740 --> 00:55:35.235 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: But where have
we compromised our ethics?

00:55:35.235 --> 00:55:36.850 align:middle line:90%
>>TARPEY: Yeah, yeah, yeah.

00:55:36.850 --> 00:55:42.380 align:middle line:84%
And we've allowed it to
happen because we don't know.

00:55:42.380 --> 00:55:44.570 align:middle line:10%
And the conversation
now in government

00:55:44.570 --> 00:55:50.030 align:middle line:10%
is like a pack of teenagers
when I first reached puberty

00:55:50.030 --> 00:55:52.700 align:middle line:10%
and we started going
out with girls--

00:55:52.700 --> 00:55:57.290 align:middle line:10%
oh, he's bad, he doesn't know
anything, and he's impolite,

00:55:57.290 --> 00:56:02.270 align:middle line:10%
and all this reality
show type of conversation

00:56:02.270 --> 00:56:04.820 align:middle line:10%
among people that do not read.

00:56:04.820 --> 00:56:08.150 align:middle line:10%
There's no past, and
there's no future.

00:56:08.150 --> 00:56:11.730 align:middle line:84%
There's only the
present of insanity.

00:56:11.730 --> 00:56:15.110 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So we, as the
citizens of this world,

00:56:15.110 --> 00:56:17.780 align:middle line:84%
we don't want to go down a
similar path we had before.

00:56:17.780 --> 00:56:18.930 align:middle line:90%
We don't need that.

00:56:18.930 --> 00:56:21.200 align:middle line:84%
So we have to
begin understanding

00:56:21.200 --> 00:56:22.910 align:middle line:84%
the wisdom, and
beauty, and everything

00:56:22.910 --> 00:56:24.272 align:middle line:90%
around us, the Earth.

00:56:24.272 --> 00:56:25.480 align:middle line:90%
>>TARPEY: At the grass roots.

00:56:25.480 --> 00:56:26.390 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: At the grass roots.

00:56:26.390 --> 00:56:27.390 align:middle line:90%
>>TARPEY: To each other.

00:56:27.390 --> 00:56:30.770 align:middle line:84%
We are healers and
counselors to each other.

00:56:30.770 --> 00:56:35.580 align:middle line:84%
And my job is activating shamans
through the Mayan calendar

00:56:35.580 --> 00:56:36.470 align:middle line:90%
and that work.

00:56:36.470 --> 00:56:40.100 align:middle line:84%
But your job is
pulling information

00:56:40.100 --> 00:56:42.110 align:middle line:84%
from people, which
you are a master at.

00:56:42.110 --> 00:56:43.100 align:middle line:90%
Thank you so much.

00:56:43.100 --> 00:56:45.375 align:middle line:84%
It's my privilege to
be with you again.

00:56:45.375 --> 00:56:47.000 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Well, you
said goodbye on cue

00:56:47.000 --> 00:56:48.530 align:middle line:84%
because we're just
now out of time.

00:56:48.530 --> 00:56:50.430 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHTER]

00:56:50.430 --> 00:56:52.160 align:middle line:90%
Thank you for that, Raymond.

00:56:52.160 --> 00:56:53.660 align:middle line:84%
Of course, we didn't
get to anything

00:56:53.660 --> 00:56:54.770 align:middle line:90%
in this three-page script.

00:56:54.770 --> 00:56:56.540 align:middle line:10%
We pretty much talked
about other things,

00:56:56.540 --> 00:56:58.340 align:middle line:10%
which I'm very grateful
for because that's

00:56:58.340 --> 00:56:59.810 align:middle line:10%
what we always do.

00:56:59.810 --> 00:57:01.400 align:middle line:10%
It takes its own way.

00:57:01.400 --> 00:57:05.990 align:middle line:84%
And so, again, I think
these are very wise words,

00:57:05.990 --> 00:57:09.680 align:middle line:84%
as a warning on one hand, but
also always the opportunity

00:57:09.680 --> 00:57:11.030 align:middle line:90%
is embedded in the warning.

00:57:11.030 --> 00:57:12.210 align:middle line:90%
>>TARPEY: That's right.

00:57:12.210 --> 00:57:13.460 align:middle line:90%
And keep up hope.

00:57:13.460 --> 00:57:14.584 align:middle line:90%
The only thing we have--

00:57:14.584 --> 00:57:16.060 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes, absolutely.

00:57:16.060 --> 00:57:18.470 align:middle line:84%
>>TARPEY: --the Buddhists
call it a little, silver cord.

00:57:18.470 --> 00:57:19.460 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:57:19.460 --> 00:57:24.730 align:middle line:84%
>>TARPEY: And it is a string
of hope that you always have.

00:57:24.730 --> 00:57:28.740 align:middle line:84%
And the only way you can be
defeated is to lose hope.

00:57:28.740 --> 00:57:29.540 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Agreed.

00:57:29.540 --> 00:57:29.990 align:middle line:90%
>>TARPEY: Yeah.

00:57:29.990 --> 00:57:31.323 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: We're totally in sync.

00:57:31.323 --> 00:57:33.605 align:middle line:84%
And I'm sure earthkeeper
would validate that too

00:57:33.605 --> 00:57:35.863 align:middle line:90%
or is validating that.

00:57:35.863 --> 00:57:36.696 align:middle line:90%
Thank you, Raymond--

00:57:36.696 --> 00:57:37.000 align:middle line:90%
>>TARPEY: That was so great.

00:57:37.000 --> 00:57:37.550 align:middle line:90%
Thank you.

00:57:37.550 --> 00:57:38.467 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: --as always.

00:57:38.467 --> 00:57:39.690 align:middle line:90%
It's been wonderful.

00:57:39.690 --> 00:57:40.490 align:middle line:90%
>>TARPEY: Wow.

00:57:40.490 --> 00:57:42.020 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: As you said,
we've been around many times

00:57:42.020 --> 00:57:42.150 align:middle line:90%
together.

00:57:42.150 --> 00:57:43.367 align:middle line:90%
>>TARPEY: It's magic, yeah.

00:57:43.367 --> 00:57:45.200 align:middle line:10%
>>REGINA: To connect
with the well of wisdom

00:57:45.200 --> 00:57:46.760 align:middle line:10%
you've just been
experiencing, you

can go to raymondtarpey.com.

00:57:49.280 --> 00:57:53.480 align:middle line:10%
Until next time, thank you for
joining us on "Open Minds."
