00:00:19.452 --> 00:00:20.910 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA MEREDITH:
Many of you have

00:00:20.910 --> 00:00:22.980 align:middle line:84%
seen the face of our
next guest, Mike Chen,

00:00:22.980 --> 00:00:25.170 align:middle line:90%
on YouTube on "Beyond Science."

00:00:25.170 --> 00:00:27.450 align:middle line:10%
He puts short but
succinct videos together

00:00:27.450 --> 00:00:30.360 align:middle line:10%
on scientific mysteries and
anomalies for a mass media

00:00:30.360 --> 00:00:32.640 align:middle line:10%
audience who is very
curious but oftentimes

00:00:32.640 --> 00:00:33.990 align:middle line:10%
new to these subjects.

00:00:33.990 --> 00:00:36.890 align:middle line:84%
His story is a unique one
as he was raised in China,

00:00:36.890 --> 00:00:39.135 align:middle line:84%
and he's a practitioner
of a form of qigong

00:00:39.135 --> 00:00:41.010 align:middle line:84%
that is banned by the
government there, which

00:00:41.010 --> 00:00:42.480 align:middle line:90%
means he can't really go home.

00:00:42.480 --> 00:00:45.860 align:middle line:84%
But he's certainly making
the best of life in America.

00:00:45.860 --> 00:00:46.660 align:middle line:90%
Welcome, Mike.

00:00:46.660 --> 00:00:47.250 align:middle line:90%
It's wonderful.

00:00:47.250 --> 00:00:49.000 align:middle line:84%
We've been chatting
off camera, and you're

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:52.740 align:middle line:84%
just absolutely delightful,
just a really open hearted, open

00:00:52.740 --> 00:00:54.960 align:middle line:84%
spirited person, which
is I think why you

00:00:54.960 --> 00:00:56.220 align:middle line:90%
have gajillions of followers.

00:00:56.220 --> 00:00:58.345 align:middle line:84%
>>MIKE CHEN: Well, thank
you so much for having me.

00:00:58.345 --> 00:01:01.200 align:middle line:10%
It's such a pleasure to meet
you and be here talking to you.

00:01:01.200 --> 00:01:02.290 align:middle line:90%
And thank you so much.

00:01:02.290 --> 00:01:03.090 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:01:03.090 --> 00:01:04.980 align:middle line:84%
And I want to start
getting into your story

00:01:04.980 --> 00:01:07.230 align:middle line:84%
because it's not one that most
people here are familiar with.

00:01:07.230 --> 00:01:08.096 align:middle line:90%
>>CHEN: Sure.

00:01:08.096 --> 00:01:11.100 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And we're going to be
talking a little bit about this

00:01:11.100 --> 00:01:13.270 align:middle line:90%
form of qigong that is so--

00:01:13.270 --> 00:01:14.380 align:middle line:90%
and find out why it's so--

00:01:14.380 --> 00:01:15.180 align:middle line:90%
how powerful it is.

00:01:15.180 --> 00:01:15.590 align:middle line:90%
>>CHEN: Right.

00:01:15.590 --> 00:01:17.280 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: What we
can do with it by way

00:01:17.280 --> 00:01:20.340 align:middle line:84%
of our own personal expansion
if we access to learning it

00:01:20.340 --> 00:01:22.290 align:middle line:84%
and also why the
Chinese government is so

00:01:22.290 --> 00:01:22.830 align:middle line:90%
threatened by it.

00:01:22.830 --> 00:01:25.260 align:middle line:84%
And there is-- I will give
everyone a heads up right now--

00:01:25.260 --> 00:01:28.650 align:middle line:84%
there's a little bit of a dark
thread in this story, which

00:01:28.650 --> 00:01:30.700 align:middle line:84%
is important for people
to know about as well,

00:01:30.700 --> 00:01:32.560 align:middle line:84%
but we're not going to hang
out in that area too long.

00:01:32.560 --> 00:01:33.417 align:middle line:90%
>>CHEN: Yeah.

00:01:33.417 --> 00:01:34.875 align:middle line:84%
There's a sad, very
sad part of it.

00:01:34.875 --> 00:01:35.280 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Very sad.

00:01:35.280 --> 00:01:36.610 align:middle line:90%
And we'll get to that in a bit.

00:01:36.610 --> 00:01:38.530 align:middle line:84%
And then I'm hoping
we have some time left

00:01:38.530 --> 00:01:39.655 align:middle line:90%
because we're both foodies.

00:01:39.655 --> 00:01:40.146 align:middle line:90%
>>CHEN: Of course.

00:01:40.146 --> 00:01:42.521 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And we're going to
talk about dumplings and dim

00:01:42.521 --> 00:01:43.325 align:middle line:90%
sum.

00:01:43.325 --> 00:01:45.210 align:middle line:84%
>>CHEN: That's what-- that's
what they used to call me

00:01:45.210 --> 00:01:46.293 align:middle line:90%
in high school, Dumplings.

00:01:46.293 --> 00:01:48.060 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: [LAUGHS] Dumplings!

00:01:48.060 --> 00:01:49.560 align:middle line:90%
Yes, I love it.

00:01:49.560 --> 00:01:52.195 align:middle line:84%
So let's start out with you
as a little kid in China,

00:01:52.195 --> 00:01:53.820 align:middle line:84%
what your life was
like, and I know you

00:01:53.820 --> 00:01:55.300 align:middle line:90%
had an accident at a young age.

00:01:55.300 --> 00:01:56.800 align:middle line:84%
So let's-- start
telling your story.

00:01:56.800 --> 00:01:57.000 align:middle line:90%
>>CHEN: Sure.

00:01:57.000 --> 00:01:57.800 align:middle line:90%
Oh, yeah.

00:01:57.800 --> 00:01:59.020 align:middle line:90%
So I grew up in China.

00:01:59.020 --> 00:02:01.050 align:middle line:84%
Well, I grew up 'til the
age of eight in China,

00:02:01.050 --> 00:02:05.310 align:middle line:84%
and I was born in the old
capital, which is called Xi'an.

00:02:05.310 --> 00:02:07.660 align:middle line:10%
So this is the original
capital of China.

00:02:07.660 --> 00:02:10.740 align:middle line:10%
When China was
formed to its first--

00:02:10.740 --> 00:02:12.942 align:middle line:10%
as a country, this
was the capital.

00:02:12.942 --> 00:02:14.650 align:middle line:84%
And not a lot of people
used to go there.

00:02:14.650 --> 00:02:17.070 align:middle line:84%
It's considered a
poorer part of China,

00:02:17.070 --> 00:02:21.450 align:middle line:84%
but I consider it the
best foods in China

00:02:21.450 --> 00:02:23.323 align:middle line:90%
you can find is in my city.

00:02:23.323 --> 00:02:24.990 align:middle line:84%
People say that, but
I actually mean it.

00:02:24.990 --> 00:02:25.993 align:middle line:90%
I think it's 100% true.

00:02:25.993 --> 00:02:27.660 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: I think
almost-- no one's even

00:02:27.660 --> 00:02:29.130 align:middle line:90%
heard of this city in the West.

00:02:29.130 --> 00:02:29.930 align:middle line:90%
>>CHEN: No, no.

00:02:29.930 --> 00:02:31.690 align:middle line:84%
It's very-- it's--
because the food--

00:02:31.690 --> 00:02:35.490 align:middle line:84%
people have heard of Cantonese
food or Szechuan food,

00:02:35.490 --> 00:02:39.660 align:middle line:84%
and they relate that to
a province back in China.

00:02:39.660 --> 00:02:41.970 align:middle line:84%
But Xi'an food is
not as popular here.

00:02:41.970 --> 00:02:43.397 align:middle line:90%
But again like I said it's--

00:02:43.397 --> 00:02:44.480 align:middle line:90%
I feel like it's the best.

00:02:44.480 --> 00:02:44.730 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: OK.

00:02:44.730 --> 00:02:46.140 align:middle line:84%
Let's just talk food
just for a minute.

00:02:46.140 --> 00:02:46.332 align:middle line:90%
>>CHEN: OK.

00:02:46.332 --> 00:02:46.430 align:middle line:90%
Sure.

00:02:46.430 --> 00:02:48.900 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So OK, what's the
characteristic as compared

00:02:48.900 --> 00:02:51.320 align:middle line:90%
to Cantonese and Szechuan?

00:02:51.320 --> 00:02:52.170 align:middle line:90%
>>CHEN: Szechuan.

00:02:52.170 --> 00:02:54.420 align:middle line:84%
I mean, there's many different
types cuisine in China.

00:02:54.420 --> 00:02:57.060 align:middle line:84%
And in the north, we eat a
lot more noodles and buns,

00:02:57.060 --> 00:02:59.117 align:middle line:84%
basically a lot
more wheat items.

00:02:59.117 --> 00:02:59.950 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Dumplings.

00:02:59.950 --> 00:03:02.870 align:middle line:84%
>>CHEN: Yeah, because we don't
grow rice that well up north.

00:03:02.870 --> 00:03:05.310 align:middle line:84%
So Xi'an food is
a lot of noodles,

00:03:05.310 --> 00:03:10.200 align:middle line:84%
a lot of buns, like pork
buns, and grilled buns,

00:03:10.200 --> 00:03:13.530 align:middle line:84%
and fried buns, and all sorts
of buns is from the north.

00:03:13.530 --> 00:03:16.350 align:middle line:84%
And that's what our
city does the best is

00:03:16.350 --> 00:03:18.360 align:middle line:90%
buns and noodles and dumplings.

00:03:18.360 --> 00:03:20.330 align:middle line:90%
And that's what we're known for.

00:03:20.330 --> 00:03:21.780 align:middle line:90%
And it's delicious.

00:03:21.780 --> 00:03:22.870 align:middle line:90%
It's the best.

00:03:22.870 --> 00:03:23.670 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: OK.

00:03:23.670 --> 00:03:24.960 align:middle line:84%
So you've got a
plug in for that.

00:03:24.960 --> 00:03:25.500 align:middle line:90%
>>CHEN: Yes.

00:03:25.500 --> 00:03:26.890 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: You have
a show on food, too.

00:03:26.890 --> 00:03:27.190 align:middle line:90%
>>CHEN: I do.

00:03:27.190 --> 00:03:27.390 align:middle line:90%
I do.

00:03:27.390 --> 00:03:28.800 align:middle line:90%
I do have a food show.

00:03:28.800 --> 00:03:29.637 align:middle line:90%
I'm a huge foodie.

00:03:29.637 --> 00:03:30.970 align:middle line:90%
So there's two loves in my life.

00:03:30.970 --> 00:03:34.800 align:middle line:84%
I love exploring the unknown,
the mysteries in the universe.

00:03:34.800 --> 00:03:36.120 align:middle line:90%
And I love to eat.

00:03:36.120 --> 00:03:38.850 align:middle line:84%
Because, hey, when you get tired
of exploring the mysteries,

00:03:38.850 --> 00:03:39.750 align:middle line:90%
you got to chow down.

00:03:39.750 --> 00:03:41.610 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: OK, so you're my
soul brother, because that's

00:03:41.610 --> 00:03:42.410 align:middle line:90%
the same with me.

00:03:42.410 --> 00:03:43.440 align:middle line:90%
>>CHEN: That's awesome.

00:03:43.440 --> 00:03:45.482 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: I go to the
kitchen and start baking it

00:03:45.482 --> 00:03:46.740 align:middle line:90%
for the other half of my life.

00:03:46.740 --> 00:03:47.040 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:03:47.040 --> 00:03:48.360 align:middle line:84%
So let's talk about
your life in China.

00:03:48.360 --> 00:03:49.160 align:middle line:90%
>>CHEN: OK.

00:03:49.160 --> 00:03:51.450 align:middle line:90%
So I grew up in Xi'an.

00:03:51.450 --> 00:03:54.300 align:middle line:84%
My parents-- my dad was
a professor and my mom

00:03:54.300 --> 00:03:56.100 align:middle line:90%
was in the government.

00:03:56.100 --> 00:03:58.560 align:middle line:84%
And we grew up in
government housing.

00:03:58.560 --> 00:04:01.560 align:middle line:84%
Back then, most housing actually
kind of looked very similar

00:04:01.560 --> 00:04:03.100 align:middle line:90%
to each other.

00:04:03.100 --> 00:04:05.160 align:middle line:84%
So I was there
till second grade,

00:04:05.160 --> 00:04:06.690 align:middle line:84%
eight-years old,
and I moved here.

00:04:06.690 --> 00:04:09.300 align:middle line:90%
But I started--

00:04:09.300 --> 00:04:10.230 align:middle line:90%
I don't know why.

00:04:10.230 --> 00:04:15.030 align:middle line:84%
Thinking back, I think
my love for the mysteries

00:04:15.030 --> 00:04:17.763 align:middle line:84%
of the universe and
why we're all here,

00:04:17.763 --> 00:04:19.930 align:middle line:84%
I started thinking about
that at a really young age.

00:04:19.930 --> 00:04:22.050 align:middle line:84%
I remember-- back
when you're a kid,

00:04:22.050 --> 00:04:24.690 align:middle line:84%
you talk about, oh, maybe
there's monsters in the world.

00:04:24.690 --> 00:04:25.770 align:middle line:90%
Maybe there's ghosts.

00:04:25.770 --> 00:04:28.440 align:middle line:84%
Maybe this place is haunted
place, that place is haunted.

00:04:28.440 --> 00:04:30.110 align:middle line:90%
I was so into that.

00:04:30.110 --> 00:04:33.990 align:middle line:84%
And one specific
incident that happened

00:04:33.990 --> 00:04:37.410 align:middle line:84%
when I was a kid that
I remember clearly,

00:04:37.410 --> 00:04:43.830 align:middle line:84%
it changed the way I
think I perceive what

00:04:43.830 --> 00:04:46.650 align:middle line:84%
the purpose of life
is and kind of like

00:04:46.650 --> 00:04:49.470 align:middle line:84%
made me question
everything even more.

00:04:49.470 --> 00:04:52.860 align:middle line:84%
Because what happened
to me was pretty insane.

00:04:52.860 --> 00:04:55.170 align:middle line:84%
I was-- me and a
bunch of friends

00:04:55.170 --> 00:04:57.360 align:middle line:84%
were playing outside our
apartment complex, which

00:04:57.360 --> 00:05:00.570 align:middle line:84%
was near this little
bit of a highway, cars

00:05:00.570 --> 00:05:01.380 align:middle line:90%
going pretty fast.

00:05:01.380 --> 00:05:04.740 align:middle line:84%
And we were running
from a bully.

00:05:04.740 --> 00:05:05.770 align:middle line:90%
And he was chasing us.

00:05:05.770 --> 00:05:06.570 align:middle line:90%
He saw us.

00:05:06.570 --> 00:05:07.140 align:middle line:90%
He came over.

00:05:07.140 --> 00:05:09.030 align:middle line:84%
I mean, Chinese kids,
like, you see each other,

00:05:09.030 --> 00:05:09.690 align:middle line:90%
you beat each other up.

00:05:09.690 --> 00:05:09.970 align:middle line:90%
I don't know.

00:05:09.970 --> 00:05:11.520 align:middle line:84%
That's how we greet
each other back then.

00:05:11.520 --> 00:05:12.930 align:middle line:90%
So I didn't want to get beat up.

00:05:12.930 --> 00:05:13.920 align:middle line:90%
And he's chasing us.

00:05:13.920 --> 00:05:17.430 align:middle line:84%
I remember still, very vividly
to this day, me and my friends,

00:05:17.430 --> 00:05:19.230 align:middle line:84%
we decided to run
across the street,

00:05:19.230 --> 00:05:21.840 align:middle line:84%
because we figured he wouldn't
dare follow us across street

00:05:21.840 --> 00:05:23.252 align:middle line:90%
because so many cars coming.

00:05:23.252 --> 00:05:24.210 align:middle line:90%
So we didn't even look.

00:05:24.210 --> 00:05:25.480 align:middle line:84%
And we just dashed
across the street.

00:05:25.480 --> 00:05:26.640 align:middle line:90%
It was kind of dusk now.

00:05:26.640 --> 00:05:28.300 align:middle line:90%
It was like not so bright.

00:05:28.300 --> 00:05:31.560 align:middle line:84%
And again, it's not so
bright for me to do that.

00:05:31.560 --> 00:05:32.360 align:middle line:90%
And we made it.

00:05:32.360 --> 00:05:35.520 align:middle line:84%
And then the bully ran after
us, and then he made it, too.

00:05:35.520 --> 00:05:37.260 align:middle line:84%
And then, we're like,
OK, let's run back.

00:05:37.260 --> 00:05:38.700 align:middle line:90%
So my friend ran back.

00:05:38.700 --> 00:05:40.680 align:middle line:90%
And I-- I remember hesitating.

00:05:40.680 --> 00:05:44.110 align:middle line:84%
I remember I ran to the middle
of the street, and I hesitated.

00:05:44.110 --> 00:05:45.690 align:middle line:84%
In that one second
of hesitation,

00:05:45.690 --> 00:05:47.290 align:middle line:90%
I felt something hit me--

00:05:47.290 --> 00:05:48.090 align:middle line:90%
smack.

00:05:48.090 --> 00:05:49.920 align:middle line:84%
And I felt myself
flying in the air.

00:05:49.920 --> 00:05:51.080 align:middle line:90%
And I could see--

00:05:51.080 --> 00:05:53.360 align:middle line:90%
not like flying out of my body.

00:05:53.360 --> 00:05:55.433 align:middle line:84%
I could feel my body
flying in the air.

00:05:55.433 --> 00:05:57.600 align:middle line:84%
And I could see my friend
who ran across the street,

00:05:57.600 --> 00:05:59.652 align:middle line:90%
and he was laughing.

00:05:59.652 --> 00:06:00.610 align:middle line:90%
Not such a good friend.

00:06:00.610 --> 00:06:01.014 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Laughing?

00:06:01.014 --> 00:06:02.088 align:middle line:90%
>>CHEN: He was laugh--

00:06:02.088 --> 00:06:03.380 align:middle line:90%
What kind of person laughs at--

00:06:03.380 --> 00:06:06.000 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: When your
friend's been hit by a car.

00:06:06.000 --> 00:06:07.710 align:middle line:84%
>>CHEN: So anyway,
because you're a kid,

00:06:07.710 --> 00:06:10.420 align:middle line:90%
you go, oh, he's laughing.

00:06:10.420 --> 00:06:13.470 align:middle line:84%
And I remember up in the
sky just, I'm like, oh.

00:06:13.470 --> 00:06:15.450 align:middle line:90%
And then I hit the ground hard.

00:06:15.450 --> 00:06:16.320 align:middle line:90%
And I bounced.

00:06:16.320 --> 00:06:19.380 align:middle line:84%
And I remember just like
bouncing on the ground.

00:06:19.380 --> 00:06:20.970 align:middle line:90%
And then everything stops.

00:06:20.970 --> 00:06:23.360 align:middle line:84%
And then the next thing I
know, the driver came out.

00:06:23.360 --> 00:06:24.490 align:middle line:90%
It was a truck.

00:06:24.490 --> 00:06:25.740 align:middle line:90%
And the truck driver came out.

00:06:25.740 --> 00:06:26.770 align:middle line:90%
He was like, are you OK?

00:06:26.770 --> 00:06:27.510 align:middle line:90%
And I'm like, yeah, yeah.

00:06:27.510 --> 00:06:27.960 align:middle line:90%
I'm fine.

00:06:27.960 --> 00:06:28.760 align:middle line:90%
I'm fine.

00:06:28.760 --> 00:06:30.590 align:middle line:84%
And back then, I didn't
want any trouble.

00:06:30.590 --> 00:06:32.548 align:middle line:84%
And that's kind of our
mentality back then was,

00:06:32.548 --> 00:06:33.570 align:middle line:90%
don't get in trouble.

00:06:33.570 --> 00:06:36.325 align:middle line:84%
You know, just if you're
OK, just come home.

00:06:36.325 --> 00:06:37.450 align:middle line:90%
So I was telling everybody.

00:06:37.450 --> 00:06:39.370 align:middle line:84%
And by this time, the
entire road has stopped.

00:06:39.370 --> 00:06:40.870 align:middle line:84%
I remember all the
drivers came out,

00:06:40.870 --> 00:06:43.410 align:middle line:84%
because it was a
fairly big thing.

00:06:43.410 --> 00:06:45.550 align:middle line:84%
And then I just said,
no, no, no, I'm fine.

00:06:45.550 --> 00:06:46.350 align:middle line:90%
Look at me.

00:06:46.350 --> 00:06:47.370 align:middle line:90%
I don't have--

00:06:47.370 --> 00:06:48.660 align:middle line:90%
I'm not broken or anything.

00:06:48.660 --> 00:06:49.650 align:middle line:90%
Let me go home.

00:06:49.650 --> 00:06:52.410 align:middle line:84%
And finally, he was, OK, if
you're sure, then go home.

00:06:52.410 --> 00:06:55.170 align:middle line:84%
So I ran home with my
friend, and I even asked him.

00:06:55.170 --> 00:06:56.650 align:middle line:90%
I said, why were you laughing?

00:06:56.650 --> 00:06:59.317 align:middle line:84%
And he was like, well, because
you flew so high in the air.

00:06:59.317 --> 00:07:00.150 align:middle line:90%
That's what he said.

00:07:00.150 --> 00:07:01.600 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So you
were struck hard?

00:07:01.600 --> 00:07:02.850 align:middle line:90%
>>CHEN: Oh, I was struck hard.

00:07:02.850 --> 00:07:04.450 align:middle line:90%
And then I went home.

00:07:04.450 --> 00:07:06.150 align:middle line:90%
And nothing happened.

00:07:06.150 --> 00:07:10.130 align:middle line:84%
And I ate dinner,
and I was in bed.

00:07:10.130 --> 00:07:13.680 align:middle line:84%
And after that, thinking
about it, it freaked me out.

00:07:13.680 --> 00:07:14.800 align:middle line:90%
And then I started crying.

00:07:14.800 --> 00:07:17.230 align:middle line:84%
Then, I was like, Mom,
I got hit by a car.

00:07:17.230 --> 00:07:18.910 align:middle line:84%
And then my mom
started freaking out,

00:07:18.910 --> 00:07:22.050 align:middle line:84%
and she takes me to the
hospital right away that night.

00:07:22.050 --> 00:07:24.260 align:middle line:90%
Not a scratch on me.

00:07:24.260 --> 00:07:25.060 align:middle line:90%
And I was like--

00:07:25.060 --> 00:07:26.435 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Were
you-- no bruises--

00:07:26.435 --> 00:07:27.235 align:middle line:90%
>>CHEN: Nothing.

00:07:27.235 --> 00:07:28.410 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Or impacts at all?

00:07:28.410 --> 00:07:29.368 align:middle line:90%
>>CHEN: Nothing at all.

00:07:29.368 --> 00:07:31.200 align:middle line:84%
Doctors were like,
there's really nothing.

00:07:31.200 --> 00:07:32.160 align:middle line:90%
There's nothing.

00:07:32.160 --> 00:07:34.420 align:middle line:84%
So at the time, I
was like, all right.

00:07:34.420 --> 00:07:35.220 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:07:35.220 --> 00:07:36.798 align:middle line:90%
I don't know what this means.

00:07:36.798 --> 00:07:39.090 align:middle line:84%
But later in life when I'm
thinking about this, I mean,

00:07:39.090 --> 00:07:40.600 align:middle line:90%
this is really impossible.

00:07:40.600 --> 00:07:41.400 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:07:41.400 --> 00:07:42.930 align:middle line:84%
>>CHEN: How did
this even happen?

00:07:42.930 --> 00:07:46.115 align:middle line:84%
So I started thinking,
OK, maybe, I don't know.

00:07:46.115 --> 00:07:48.240 align:middle line:84%
Maybe there's something
I'm supposed to do in life,

00:07:48.240 --> 00:07:50.160 align:middle line:84%
like maybe I'm
here for a reason.

00:07:50.160 --> 00:07:54.420 align:middle line:84%
There must be something more
than OK, live your life,

00:07:54.420 --> 00:07:55.700 align:middle line:90%
get married, have kids, die.

00:07:55.700 --> 00:07:59.760 align:middle line:84%
Like there must be something
more to it than that.

00:07:59.760 --> 00:08:03.100 align:middle line:84%
And that's what got me propelled
into thinking, let's dive

00:08:03.100 --> 00:08:03.900 align:middle line:90%
into this more.

00:08:03.900 --> 00:08:07.390 align:middle line:84%
Let's see what other cases of
these there are in the world.

00:08:07.390 --> 00:08:10.060 align:middle line:84%
Let's see what other
strange phenomenon questions

00:08:10.060 --> 00:08:10.860 align:middle line:90%
people have.

00:08:10.860 --> 00:08:13.530 align:middle line:84%
And that's why I became really
interested in all this stuff

00:08:13.530 --> 00:08:15.940 align:middle line:90%
after I came to America.

00:08:15.940 --> 00:08:16.740 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:08:16.740 --> 00:08:17.580 align:middle line:90%
Interesting.

00:08:17.580 --> 00:08:22.290 align:middle line:84%
Well, As you've looked back
on it, on that event that day,

00:08:22.290 --> 00:08:24.930 align:middle line:90%
what have you come to?

00:08:24.930 --> 00:08:31.310 align:middle line:84%
>>CHEN: I do think, 100%, that
that was not just a simple

00:08:31.310 --> 00:08:32.500 align:middle line:90%
get hit by a truck.

00:08:32.500 --> 00:08:34.210 align:middle line:84%
And I don't believe
in coincidences.

00:08:34.210 --> 00:08:35.010 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:08:35.010 --> 00:08:35.968 align:middle line:90%
>>CHEN: I really don't.

00:08:35.968 --> 00:08:40.260 align:middle line:84%
I don't feel like anything
in life is a coincidence.

00:08:40.260 --> 00:08:43.559 align:middle line:84%
I feel everything is-- in
Chinese, we call it [CHINESE],,

00:08:43.559 --> 00:08:46.830 align:middle line:84%
which means like a
interpersonal, karmic

00:08:46.830 --> 00:08:49.890 align:middle line:84%
relationship we have
with everyone around us.

00:08:49.890 --> 00:08:53.250 align:middle line:84%
People we meet on a daily
basis even for a second,

00:08:53.250 --> 00:08:55.920 align:middle line:84%
there is a certain
amount of [CHINESE]..

00:08:55.920 --> 00:08:57.200 align:middle line:90%
That's the reason why we met.

00:08:57.200 --> 00:09:04.690 align:middle line:84%
There's an old Chinese
saying, called [CHINESE],,

00:09:04.690 --> 00:09:07.500 align:middle line:84%
which means 10 years
of karmic relationship

00:09:07.500 --> 00:09:09.350 align:middle line:84%
will get you on the
same boat together

00:09:09.350 --> 00:09:11.190 align:middle line:84%
and a hundred years
of karmic relationship

00:09:11.190 --> 00:09:13.680 align:middle line:90%
will get you married together.

00:09:13.680 --> 00:09:16.860 align:middle line:84%
So Chinese are-- we
consider this almost--

00:09:16.860 --> 00:09:20.055 align:middle line:84%
this is part of our culture,
like the traditional culture.

00:09:20.055 --> 00:09:22.180 align:middle line:84%
Now, there's not so much
for modern Chinese people.

00:09:22.180 --> 00:09:23.973 align:middle line:84%
But traditional culture,
like in history,

00:09:23.973 --> 00:09:25.140 align:middle line:90%
that's what people believed.

00:09:25.140 --> 00:09:27.060 align:middle line:90%
And I believed in that as well.

00:09:27.060 --> 00:09:29.910 align:middle line:84%
And thinking back, I do
feel like I was here.

00:09:29.910 --> 00:09:32.320 align:middle line:84%
There's a purpose
for me being here.

00:09:32.320 --> 00:09:35.080 align:middle line:90%
And I think I figured that out.

00:09:35.080 --> 00:09:40.865 align:middle line:84%
But I do not think it was just
so I could just live a life

00:09:40.865 --> 00:09:41.740 align:middle line:90%
and grow old and die.

00:09:41.740 --> 00:09:42.100 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:09:42.100 --> 00:09:42.635 align:middle line:90%
Right.

00:09:42.635 --> 00:09:44.970 align:middle line:84%
And so do you feel that there
was some kind of protection,

00:09:44.970 --> 00:09:46.830 align:middle line:84%
there was something
that happened that day--

00:09:46.830 --> 00:09:47.240 align:middle line:90%
>>CHEN: For sure, yeah.

00:09:47.240 --> 00:09:49.470 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: --that allowed
you to remain unscathed so

00:09:49.470 --> 00:09:51.960 align:middle line:84%
that you can reflect on it
later and say, I have purpose?

00:09:51.960 --> 00:09:52.260 align:middle line:90%
>>CHEN: Yes.

00:09:52.260 --> 00:09:53.060 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:09:53.060 --> 00:09:56.910 align:middle line:84%
>>CHEN: I mean, I think, at
least for me I believe there

00:09:56.910 --> 00:10:00.105 align:middle line:84%
are so many things in the world
that we cannot see or touch.

00:10:00.105 --> 00:10:02.730 align:middle line:84%
I mean, scientifically speaking,
there are many of those things

00:10:02.730 --> 00:10:03.990 align:middle line:90%
already, like radio waves.

00:10:03.990 --> 00:10:06.970 align:middle line:84%
And you can't see anything,
but they're there.

00:10:06.970 --> 00:10:09.030 align:middle line:84%
I do believe that
there are things

00:10:09.030 --> 00:10:13.650 align:middle line:84%
out there that you could say,
they're watching out for you,

00:10:13.650 --> 00:10:18.720 align:middle line:84%
or intervening because
of some bigger purpose.

00:10:18.720 --> 00:10:20.520 align:middle line:84%
But I believe there
are those entities.

00:10:20.520 --> 00:10:22.350 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: It. certainly
seems to fit that category.

00:10:22.350 --> 00:10:22.830 align:middle line:90%
>>CHEN: I think so.

00:10:22.830 --> 00:10:23.913 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: So here you are.

00:10:23.913 --> 00:10:26.940 align:middle line:84%
A couple of years later, you
end up in the United States.

00:10:26.940 --> 00:10:28.000 align:middle line:90%
How did that happen?

00:10:28.000 --> 00:10:30.660 align:middle line:84%
How did your parents end up
coming to the United States?

00:10:30.660 --> 00:10:33.540 align:middle line:10%
>>CHEN: It's kind of crazy,
because technically, we

00:10:33.540 --> 00:10:37.270 align:middle line:10%
shouldn't have because my
mom had a great job in China.

00:10:37.270 --> 00:10:38.520 align:middle line:10%
She was a government official.

00:10:38.520 --> 00:10:40.145 align:middle line:84%
She could have been
a bigger government

00:10:40.145 --> 00:10:41.350 align:middle line:90%
official as time moved on.

00:10:41.350 --> 00:10:43.290 align:middle line:84%
And of course, we
know now if you're

00:10:43.290 --> 00:10:45.650 align:middle line:84%
a major official in China,
you're going to be rich.

00:10:45.650 --> 00:10:49.390 align:middle line:84%
You're going to
have a great life.

00:10:49.390 --> 00:10:52.110 align:middle line:84%
But my parents were only
in the US-- they only

00:10:52.110 --> 00:10:54.450 align:middle line:84%
wanted to come for a
year to kind of see what

00:10:54.450 --> 00:10:55.680 align:middle line:90%
it is and see what it's like.

00:10:55.680 --> 00:10:59.110 align:middle line:84%
And then they stay because
they said I wanted to stay.

00:10:59.110 --> 00:11:00.567 align:middle line:90%
And that's why they stayed.

00:11:00.567 --> 00:11:01.650 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Oh, interesting.

00:11:01.650 --> 00:11:02.200 align:middle line:90%
>>CHEN: That's what they say.

00:11:02.200 --> 00:11:02.311 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: So you drove that.

00:11:02.311 --> 00:11:03.090 align:middle line:90%
>>CHEN: I don't remember that.

00:11:03.090 --> 00:11:04.620 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Yeah, but--
so you drove that.

00:11:04.620 --> 00:11:06.210 align:middle line:84%
And did you have
brothers or sisters?

00:11:06.210 --> 00:11:07.010 align:middle line:90%
>>CHEN: No.

00:11:07.010 --> 00:11:09.000 align:middle line:84%
So you were the baby
that had already

00:11:09.000 --> 00:11:10.590 align:middle line:90%
gone through this experience.

00:11:10.590 --> 00:11:14.940 align:middle line:84%
And obviously, because you
have a very unique spark,

00:11:14.940 --> 00:11:16.983 align:middle line:84%
you know, spark and
intention in you,

00:11:16.983 --> 00:11:18.900 align:middle line:84%
that is that je ne sais
quoi, which is why you

00:11:18.900 --> 00:11:19.890 align:middle line:90%
have gajillions of followers--

00:11:19.890 --> 00:11:20.350 align:middle line:90%
>>CHEN: Oh, thank you.

00:11:20.350 --> 00:11:20.630 align:middle line:90%
Thank you so much.

00:11:20.630 --> 00:11:21.660 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Because
it is who you are.

00:11:21.660 --> 00:11:22.785 align:middle line:90%
That spirit shines through.

00:11:22.785 --> 00:11:26.160 align:middle line:84%
And so obviously raising you,
they felt and saw that spirit.

00:11:26.160 --> 00:11:30.240 align:middle line:84%
And so it sounds like they
chose to foster it, if not let

00:11:30.240 --> 00:11:32.070 align:middle line:84%
it be a guide even
in their own lives.

00:11:32.070 --> 00:11:33.960 align:middle line:90%
>>CHEN: Yeah, I mean.

00:11:33.960 --> 00:11:34.800 align:middle line:90%
Thank you so much.

00:11:34.800 --> 00:11:35.600 align:middle line:90%
That's very kind.

00:11:35.600 --> 00:11:39.900 align:middle line:84%
I just-- I didn't know
what I was back then,

00:11:39.900 --> 00:11:43.380 align:middle line:84%
but I just felt like
everything was pretty--

00:11:43.380 --> 00:11:45.210 align:middle line:84%
I mean, you feel
like when you're part

00:11:45.210 --> 00:11:47.180 align:middle line:90%
of a path that has a purpose.

00:11:47.180 --> 00:11:49.180 align:middle line:84%
And that's kind of what
I felt when I was a kid.

00:11:49.180 --> 00:11:51.630 align:middle line:84%
I didn't understand what it
was, and maybe I still don't.

00:11:51.630 --> 00:11:53.560 align:middle line:84%
But I felt like that
when I was a kid.

00:11:53.560 --> 00:11:56.160 align:middle line:84%
Because I remember in elementary
school, one of my teachers,

00:11:56.160 --> 00:11:58.080 align:middle line:84%
I forgot what class
it was, he asked,

00:11:58.080 --> 00:12:02.610 align:middle line:84%
who believes that their
lives has a purpose?

00:12:02.610 --> 00:12:04.643 align:middle line:84%
And not a lot of people
raised their hands.

00:12:04.643 --> 00:12:05.560 align:middle line:90%
And I was one of them.

00:12:05.560 --> 00:12:05.740 align:middle line:90%
I do.

00:12:05.740 --> 00:12:06.610 align:middle line:90%
And like, what's the purpose?

00:12:06.610 --> 00:12:07.410 align:middle line:90%
I have no idea.

00:12:07.410 --> 00:12:08.045 align:middle line:90%


00:12:08.045 --> 00:12:10.170 align:middle line:84%
>>CHEN: I don't know, eat
some more pizza tomorrow?

00:12:10.170 --> 00:12:11.138 align:middle line:90%
I have no idea.

00:12:11.138 --> 00:12:12.180 align:middle line:90%
But I did feel like that.

00:12:12.180 --> 00:12:13.220 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: But you
inherently understood that.

00:12:13.220 --> 00:12:14.020 align:middle line:90%
>>CHEN: For sure.

00:12:14.020 --> 00:12:16.860 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So let's start
getting into what happened.

00:12:16.860 --> 00:12:18.555 align:middle line:90%
OK, so you're in America.

00:12:18.555 --> 00:12:19.680 align:middle line:90%
Your parents reestablished.

00:12:19.680 --> 00:12:21.060 align:middle line:90%
What did they end up doing here?

00:12:21.060 --> 00:12:22.680 align:middle line:90%
>>CHEN: Horrible jobs.

00:12:22.680 --> 00:12:24.090 align:middle line:10%
I mean, just like most--

00:12:24.090 --> 00:12:27.300 align:middle line:10%
>>REGINA: After being
relatively privileged in China.

00:12:27.300 --> 00:12:28.980 align:middle line:10%
What kind of horrible
jobs did they do?

00:12:28.980 --> 00:12:31.500 align:middle line:84%
>>CHEN: I mean, my mom
worked at a sewing shop.

00:12:31.500 --> 00:12:33.180 align:middle line:84%
And I remember one
day she came home,

00:12:33.180 --> 00:12:36.000 align:middle line:84%
and she had a needle
through her finger.

00:12:36.000 --> 00:12:37.300 align:middle line:90%
It was just horrendous.

00:12:37.300 --> 00:12:38.520 align:middle line:90%
It was low pay.

00:12:38.520 --> 00:12:39.390 align:middle line:90%
It was hard labor.

00:12:39.390 --> 00:12:41.340 align:middle line:84%
My dad worked at a
restaurant as a waiter.

00:12:41.340 --> 00:12:42.450 align:middle line:90%
Because we came in--

00:12:42.450 --> 00:12:45.240 align:middle line:84%
I think he came with
a study abroad visa.

00:12:45.240 --> 00:12:48.060 align:middle line:84%
So he was attending school
at University of Tennessee.

00:12:48.060 --> 00:12:49.050 align:middle line:90%
And it was just--

00:12:49.050 --> 00:12:52.680 align:middle line:84%
we living in a house that
was called China House.

00:12:52.680 --> 00:12:54.753 align:middle line:84%
Now it sounds kind
of racist, but it was

00:12:54.753 --> 00:12:55.920 align:middle line:90%
just full of Chinese people.

00:12:55.920 --> 00:12:57.290 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Did they
speak English?

00:12:57.290 --> 00:12:57.690 align:middle line:90%
>>CHEN: Yeah.

00:12:57.690 --> 00:12:58.880 align:middle line:90%
My dad spoke English.

00:12:58.880 --> 00:12:58.980 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: OK.

00:12:58.980 --> 00:13:01.355 align:middle line:84%
>>CHEN: My dad, he actually
taught English back in China.

00:13:01.355 --> 00:13:02.400 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: OK.

00:13:02.400 --> 00:13:03.510 align:middle line:10%
>>CHEN: My mom did not.

00:13:03.510 --> 00:13:03.780 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: OK.

00:13:03.780 --> 00:13:04.980 align:middle line:84%
>>CHEN: And then
of course, I came.

00:13:04.980 --> 00:13:06.200 align:middle line:90%
I picked it up pretty quickly.

00:13:06.200 --> 00:13:06.460 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right, right.

00:13:06.460 --> 00:13:08.793 align:middle line:84%
>>CHEN: But I mean, it was
pretty bad living conditions.

00:13:08.793 --> 00:13:10.410 align:middle line:90%
We all lived in one studio.

00:13:10.410 --> 00:13:14.100 align:middle line:84%
I remember we had a leisure
activity every weekend

00:13:14.100 --> 00:13:15.715 align:middle line:84%
where we'd go to
the local library,

00:13:15.715 --> 00:13:18.090 align:middle line:84%
like, every single person in
the house go to the library,

00:13:18.090 --> 00:13:19.507 align:middle line:84%
not for fun-- oh,
I guess for fun,

00:13:19.507 --> 00:13:22.650 align:middle line:84%
but mainly because we set
off roach bombs in the house

00:13:22.650 --> 00:13:23.860 align:middle line:90%
every week.

00:13:23.860 --> 00:13:27.870 align:middle line:84%
And you come back, and it just
like the "Night of the Living

00:13:27.870 --> 00:13:29.220 align:middle line:90%
Dead" or roaches everywhere.

00:13:29.220 --> 00:13:30.780 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So it was somewhere
free to go while the roaches

00:13:30.780 --> 00:13:31.822 align:middle line:90%
died off in your home.

00:13:31.822 --> 00:13:32.294 align:middle line:90%
Wow.

00:13:32.294 --> 00:13:33.240 align:middle line:90%
>>CHEN: It was just horrendous.

00:13:33.240 --> 00:13:34.660 align:middle line:90%
So now I moved to New York City.

00:13:34.660 --> 00:13:36.000 align:middle line:90%
I'm like, roaches, whatever.

00:13:36.000 --> 00:13:37.330 align:middle line:90%
Grew up with them.

00:13:37.330 --> 00:13:38.130 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:13:38.130 --> 00:13:39.430 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: So OK.

00:13:39.430 --> 00:13:42.240 align:middle line:84%
Now, we start getting into
the story that a lot of people

00:13:42.240 --> 00:13:44.220 align:middle line:90%
will be fascinated about.

00:13:44.220 --> 00:13:46.860 align:middle line:84%
Now in terms of the
Qigong that we're

00:13:46.860 --> 00:13:49.330 align:middle line:84%
going to be talking about,
so your parents went on.

00:13:49.330 --> 00:13:50.130 align:middle line:90%
You went on.

00:13:50.130 --> 00:13:50.850 align:middle line:90%
You learned your English.

00:13:50.850 --> 00:13:52.308 align:middle line:84%
You went through
the school system.

00:13:52.308 --> 00:13:53.200 align:middle line:90%
Everybody made do.

00:13:53.200 --> 00:13:54.000 align:middle line:90%
>>CHEN: Yes

00:13:54.000 --> 00:13:55.890 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And you
started finding your way.

00:13:55.890 --> 00:13:58.255 align:middle line:84%
By college, you were
starting to find that things

00:13:58.255 --> 00:13:59.130 align:middle line:90%
weren't working well.

00:13:59.130 --> 00:14:00.840 align:middle line:84%
You went through a bit of a
depression, it sounds like?

00:14:00.840 --> 00:14:01.220 align:middle line:90%
>>CHEN: Yes.

00:14:01.220 --> 00:14:01.480 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

00:14:01.480 --> 00:14:01.770 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

00:14:01.770 --> 00:14:03.520 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And we'll
get into that.

00:14:03.520 --> 00:14:06.540 align:middle line:84%
And meanwhile, your mother,
and your mother and father

00:14:06.540 --> 00:14:09.040 align:middle line:84%
both had had an experience
with Falun Gong?

00:14:09.040 --> 00:14:09.840 align:middle line:90%
>>CHEN: Yes.

00:14:09.840 --> 00:14:10.640 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: OK.

00:14:10.640 --> 00:14:12.850 align:middle line:84%
Explain what that is and
where they had learned this.

00:14:12.850 --> 00:14:14.010 align:middle line:90%
>>CHEN: Sure.

00:14:14.010 --> 00:14:17.200 align:middle line:84%
Well, Qigong in general,
let me just start from there

00:14:17.200 --> 00:14:19.620 align:middle line:84%
because a lot of
people may not know.

00:14:19.620 --> 00:14:21.600 align:middle line:90%
In China, "Qi" means energy.

00:14:21.600 --> 00:14:23.610 align:middle line:90%
And "Gong" means the practice.

00:14:23.610 --> 00:14:28.170 align:middle line:84%
And it's very, very
common exercise in China.

00:14:28.170 --> 00:14:30.990 align:middle line:84%
Most people probably
here have heard of--

00:14:30.990 --> 00:14:33.270 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: We've seen the
videos of massive squares

00:14:33.270 --> 00:14:34.110 align:middle line:90%
and parks full of people.

00:14:34.110 --> 00:14:34.350 align:middle line:90%
>>CHEN: Yes.

00:14:34.350 --> 00:14:34.470 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

00:14:34.470 --> 00:14:34.850 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:14:34.850 --> 00:14:37.650 align:middle line:84%
>>CHEN: But probably the most
popular type of Qigong people

00:14:37.650 --> 00:14:40.860 align:middle line:84%
probably know about is Tai
Chi as a form of Qigong.

00:14:40.860 --> 00:14:43.613 align:middle line:84%
So Qigong always been
really popular in Chinese

00:14:43.613 --> 00:14:45.030 align:middle line:84%
throughout history,
but especially

00:14:45.030 --> 00:14:46.950 align:middle line:90%
so during the '80s and '90s.

00:14:46.950 --> 00:14:50.220 align:middle line:84%
That's when it just exploded
with Qigong Masters popping up

00:14:50.220 --> 00:14:55.130 align:middle line:84%
all over the place and with
legit supernatural powers.

00:14:55.130 --> 00:14:55.930 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Oh, yeah.

00:14:55.930 --> 00:14:58.510 align:middle line:84%
I've seen some personally
from a master of that.

00:14:58.510 --> 00:14:59.310 align:middle line:90%
>>CHEN: Yeah.

00:14:59.310 --> 00:15:00.490 align:middle line:90%
And they were able to heal.

00:15:00.490 --> 00:15:02.365 align:middle line:84%
And they were well, you
know, heat things up.

00:15:02.365 --> 00:15:03.810 align:middle line:90%
It was crazy stuff.

00:15:03.810 --> 00:15:05.910 align:middle line:84%
So everybody in China was
really getting into it,

00:15:05.910 --> 00:15:07.285 align:middle line:84%
because Chinese
people, one thing

00:15:07.285 --> 00:15:11.010 align:middle line:84%
we love more than anything
is our health, especially

00:15:11.010 --> 00:15:12.360 align:middle line:90%
the older people.

00:15:12.360 --> 00:15:13.902 align:middle line:84%
Like you say, you
see them in parks.

00:15:13.902 --> 00:15:15.360 align:middle line:84%
Go to China now,
you see the parks.

00:15:15.360 --> 00:15:15.407 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:15:15.407 --> 00:15:16.365 align:middle line:90%
It was very impressive.

00:15:16.365 --> 00:15:17.400 align:middle line:90%
>>CHEN: It's everywhere.

00:15:17.400 --> 00:15:20.460 align:middle line:84%
But especially popular
was the '80s and '90s.

00:15:20.460 --> 00:15:22.680 align:middle line:84%
And that's when just
tons of it came out.

00:15:22.680 --> 00:15:25.410 align:middle line:84%
And Falun Gong was one of these
Qigong meditation exercises

00:15:25.410 --> 00:15:28.770 align:middle line:90%
that came out in 1992.

00:15:28.770 --> 00:15:32.540 align:middle line:84%
But what was different was
that after three years,

00:15:32.540 --> 00:15:35.730 align:middle line:84%
over 100 million Chinese people
were practicing this Qigong

00:15:35.730 --> 00:15:38.810 align:middle line:84%
meditation, which is the fastest
growing Qigong in the history.

00:15:38.810 --> 00:15:39.120 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: 100 million.

00:15:39.120 --> 00:15:39.850 align:middle line:90%
>>CHEN: 100 million.

00:15:39.850 --> 00:15:40.130 align:middle line:90%
Imagine.

00:15:40.130 --> 00:15:42.480 align:middle line:84%
That's like almost a tenth
of China's population.

00:15:42.480 --> 00:15:43.342 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:15:43.342 --> 00:15:44.550 align:middle line:90%
>>CHEN: And it was everybody.

00:15:44.550 --> 00:15:47.970 align:middle line:84%
People with normal jobs to high
government officials, everybody

00:15:47.970 --> 00:15:54.480 align:middle line:84%
was practicing because so many
people had health benefits

00:15:54.480 --> 00:15:56.970 align:middle line:84%
because they were doing
these meditation exercises,

00:15:56.970 --> 00:15:59.340 align:middle line:84%
and that's why they
believed it so much.

00:15:59.340 --> 00:16:03.630 align:middle line:84%
And the government actually
promoted it for a long time.

00:16:03.630 --> 00:16:05.210 align:middle line:90%
Because they were like, well--

00:16:05.210 --> 00:16:05.960 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Keep people health.

00:16:05.960 --> 00:16:07.377 align:middle line:84%
>>CHEN: People are
healthy, and we

00:16:07.377 --> 00:16:11.140 align:middle line:84%
don't have to spend as much
on medical care and all that.

00:16:11.140 --> 00:16:14.910 align:middle line:84%
So there were so many government
awards given to Falun Gong.

00:16:14.910 --> 00:16:17.940 align:middle line:84%
But then in 1997,
they took a census

00:16:17.940 --> 00:16:21.210 align:middle line:84%
and realized, oh my gosh, over
100 million Chinese people

00:16:21.210 --> 00:16:22.470 align:middle line:90%
were practicing this.

00:16:22.470 --> 00:16:27.330 align:middle line:84%
And that's why in 1999, they
decided to ban the exercise.

00:16:27.330 --> 00:16:29.370 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: But one
moment on that.

00:16:29.370 --> 00:16:30.900 align:middle line:84%
Going back to
Qigong, wasn't that

00:16:30.900 --> 00:16:32.620 align:middle line:84%
already ubiquitous
in Chinese culture?

00:16:32.620 --> 00:16:33.420 align:middle line:90%
>>CHEN: Yes.

00:16:33.420 --> 00:16:35.230 align:middle line:84%
But no Qigong has
ever been as popular.

00:16:35.230 --> 00:16:36.030 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: I see.

00:16:36.030 --> 00:16:38.110 align:middle line:84%
So it was the sheer
strength in numbers--

00:16:38.110 --> 00:16:38.910 align:middle line:90%
>>CHEN: Yes.

00:16:38.910 --> 00:16:40.260 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: At the way
this had caught on?

00:16:40.260 --> 00:16:40.740 align:middle line:90%
>>CHEN: Exactly.

00:16:40.740 --> 00:16:43.198 align:middle line:84%
And also most people don't know
this about Qigong exercise,

00:16:43.198 --> 00:16:48.060 align:middle line:84%
but every single Qigong
exercise is paired

00:16:48.060 --> 00:16:49.920 align:middle line:90%
with a philosophical thought.

00:16:49.920 --> 00:16:53.520 align:middle line:84%
The exercise itself, just
like in the Shaolin Temple,

00:16:53.520 --> 00:16:55.990 align:middle line:84%
they do a form of
Qigong as well.

00:16:55.990 --> 00:16:57.990 align:middle line:84%
Their martial arts is
actually a form of Qigong.

00:16:57.990 --> 00:17:00.370 align:middle line:84%
There's a breathing
exercise and all that,

00:17:00.370 --> 00:17:02.320 align:middle line:84%
and it's paired with
Buddhist philosophy.

00:17:02.320 --> 00:17:06.150 align:middle line:84%
And Tai Chi is paired
with Taoist philosophy.

00:17:06.150 --> 00:17:08.670 align:middle line:84%
So Falun Gong is also paired
with Buddhist philosophy

00:17:08.670 --> 00:17:11.460 align:middle line:84%
as well, and it's based on the
principles of truthfulness,

00:17:11.460 --> 00:17:12.930 align:middle line:90%
compassion, and tolerance.

00:17:12.930 --> 00:17:15.000 align:middle line:84%
So there's the three
major founding principles

00:17:15.000 --> 00:17:15.810 align:middle line:90%
of Falun Gong.

00:17:15.810 --> 00:17:17.579 align:middle line:84%
So people who were
practicing it not only

00:17:17.579 --> 00:17:20.400 align:middle line:84%
got healthier, they
were becoming better.

00:17:20.400 --> 00:17:21.900 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Well, you
would think this

00:17:21.900 --> 00:17:24.490 align:middle line:84%
would be desirable on all
levels for any government

00:17:24.490 --> 00:17:25.290 align:middle line:90%
in the world.

00:17:25.290 --> 00:17:26.873 align:middle line:84%
I mean, Bhutan would
certainly dig it.

00:17:26.873 --> 00:17:27.673 align:middle line:90%
>>CHEN: Right.

00:17:27.673 --> 00:17:29.470 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: But China
was not digging it.

00:17:29.470 --> 00:17:30.270 align:middle line:90%
>>CHEN: No, no.

00:17:30.270 --> 00:17:31.070 align:middle line:90%
It wasn't.

00:17:31.070 --> 00:17:34.620 align:middle line:84%
Because most people
in China are atheist.

00:17:34.620 --> 00:17:39.000 align:middle line:84%
And the Communist Party actually
doesn't allow the belief

00:17:39.000 --> 00:17:40.545 align:middle line:90%
of even time travel and ghosts.

00:17:40.545 --> 00:17:41.670 align:middle line:90%
I'm not even kidding about.

00:17:41.670 --> 00:17:43.590 align:middle line:90%
This is actually a huge news.

00:17:43.590 --> 00:17:44.920 align:middle line:90%
I think it was a few years ago.

00:17:44.920 --> 00:17:46.350 align:middle line:84%
You can't see "Back
to the Future"

00:17:46.350 --> 00:17:49.140 align:middle line:84%
in China because it
talks about time travel.

00:17:49.140 --> 00:17:51.937 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: But they do
explore UFO phenomena.

00:17:51.937 --> 00:17:53.520 align:middle line:84%
>>CHEN: I'm not quite
sure what they--

00:17:53.520 --> 00:17:54.790 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Well, they do--

00:17:54.790 --> 00:17:55.590 align:middle line:90%
well, anyway.

00:17:55.590 --> 00:17:56.920 align:middle line:90%
That's a whole other community.

00:17:56.920 --> 00:17:57.510 align:middle line:90%
They'll explore that.

00:17:57.510 --> 00:17:58.860 align:middle line:84%
Maybe that's more
on the low down

00:17:58.860 --> 00:18:00.610 align:middle line:84%
and they don't share
that with the people.

00:18:00.610 --> 00:18:03.060 align:middle line:84%
But they don't explain any
kind of invisible phenomena.

00:18:03.060 --> 00:18:04.230 align:middle line:90%
>>CHEN: Right.

00:18:04.230 --> 00:18:07.260 align:middle line:84%
So any time any time
people in the country

00:18:07.260 --> 00:18:09.480 align:middle line:84%
start having their
own belief, it's

00:18:09.480 --> 00:18:11.610 align:middle line:84%
a problem for the
Communist Party.

00:18:11.610 --> 00:18:13.470 align:middle line:84%
So they wanted to just
completely nix it.

00:18:13.470 --> 00:18:16.230 align:middle line:84%
So in '99, what they did
was in Tiananmen Square,

00:18:16.230 --> 00:18:18.960 align:middle line:84%
they set up an
elaborate-- basically,

00:18:18.960 --> 00:18:22.210 align:middle line:84%
a hoax where they have people
set themselves on fire wearing

00:18:22.210 --> 00:18:23.060 align:middle line:90%
fireproof clothing.

00:18:23.060 --> 00:18:23.640 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Yeah, the
immolation thing, yeah.

00:18:23.640 --> 00:18:25.020 align:middle line:84%
>>CHEN: And they said,
hey, you know what?

00:18:25.020 --> 00:18:26.020 align:middle line:84%
These are Falun
Gong practitioners.

00:18:26.020 --> 00:18:27.210 align:middle line:90%
They're killing themselves.

00:18:27.210 --> 00:18:29.085 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And then they
put it on national TV

00:18:29.085 --> 00:18:30.570 align:middle line:90%
that these guys are whack jobs.

00:18:30.570 --> 00:18:31.330 align:middle line:90%
>>CHEN: National TV, yes.

00:18:31.330 --> 00:18:33.510 align:middle line:84%
And there's a great
documentary called "False Fire"

00:18:33.510 --> 00:18:35.085 align:middle line:84%
that just blew
through the entire--

00:18:35.085 --> 00:18:36.210 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Oh, "False Fire."

00:18:36.210 --> 00:18:36.990 align:middle line:90%
Is it on YouTube?

00:18:36.990 --> 00:18:37.610 align:middle line:90%
>>CHEN: It's on YouTube.

00:18:37.610 --> 00:18:38.410 align:middle line:90%
It's everywhere.

00:18:38.410 --> 00:18:41.562 align:middle line:84%
But it kind of blew through the
entire lie of the government.

00:18:41.562 --> 00:18:44.020 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: I'm so glad to know
people weren't really setting

00:18:44.020 --> 00:18:44.300 align:middle line:90%
themselves on fire.

00:18:44.300 --> 00:18:45.630 align:middle line:90%
>>CHEN: No, no, no, no, no.

00:18:45.630 --> 00:18:48.450 align:middle line:84%
Because in Falun Gong we
believe we can't kill lives.

00:18:48.450 --> 00:18:49.250 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:18:49.250 --> 00:18:50.370 align:middle line:90%
>>CHEN: Yourself is alive.

00:18:50.370 --> 00:18:51.400 align:middle line:90%
You can't kill yourself.

00:18:51.400 --> 00:18:51.600 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:18:51.600 --> 00:18:53.160 align:middle line:84%
>>CHEN: So there's no Falun
Gong practitioner that

00:18:53.160 --> 00:18:54.030 align:middle line:90%
would actually kill themselves.

00:18:54.030 --> 00:18:54.830 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:18:54.830 --> 00:18:57.840 align:middle line:84%
>>CHEN: You can see on camera a
police actually hitting someone

00:18:57.840 --> 00:19:01.500 align:middle line:84%
over the head, one of the person
who set themselves on fire,

00:19:01.500 --> 00:19:03.930 align:middle line:84%
hit him over the head
and the baton even broke.

00:19:03.930 --> 00:19:05.520 align:middle line:84%
I mean, this is
crazy documentary.

00:19:05.520 --> 00:19:07.630 align:middle line:84%
But it's just blew through
the entire narrative.

00:19:07.630 --> 00:19:08.430 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: OK.

00:19:08.430 --> 00:19:08.970 align:middle line:90%
"False Fire" on YouTube.

00:19:08.970 --> 00:19:09.720 align:middle line:90%
>>CHEN: "False Fire," yes.

00:19:09.720 --> 00:19:10.220 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: So we have that.

00:19:10.220 --> 00:19:11.020 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:19:11.020 --> 00:19:17.270 align:middle line:84%
>>CHEN: So '99, right before
this all happened, my parents--

00:19:17.270 --> 00:19:19.830 align:middle line:90%
we were living in Illinois.

00:19:19.830 --> 00:19:20.680 align:middle line:90%
I was in college.

00:19:20.680 --> 00:19:22.680 align:middle line:84%
And it was kind of a
crazy dynamic, our family.

00:19:22.680 --> 00:19:26.640 align:middle line:84%
Because my dad had the
worst temper of anybody.

00:19:26.640 --> 00:19:28.630 align:middle line:90%
He's just-- guy was just mean.

00:19:28.630 --> 00:19:29.430 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:19:29.430 --> 00:19:32.140 align:middle line:84%
>>CHEN: It was so incredibly
horrendous to live

00:19:32.140 --> 00:19:33.420 align:middle line:90%
in the household.

00:19:33.420 --> 00:19:35.290 align:middle line:84%
So I basically
escaped to college.

00:19:35.290 --> 00:19:37.050 align:middle line:84%
I didn't want to
ever come back home.

00:19:37.050 --> 00:19:38.280 align:middle line:84%
I felt bad for my
mother, because she's

00:19:38.280 --> 00:19:39.240 align:middle line:90%
the gentlest person ever.

00:19:39.240 --> 00:19:39.800 align:middle line:90%
And she--

00:19:39.800 --> 00:19:40.980 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Was he
abusive to you guys?

00:19:40.980 --> 00:19:41.780 align:middle line:90%
>>CHEN: Verbally.

00:19:41.780 --> 00:19:43.970 align:middle line:84%
Not physically, but just
incredibly verbally--

00:19:43.970 --> 00:19:45.720 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: --which can
destroy your spirit.

00:19:45.720 --> 00:19:47.820 align:middle line:90%
>>CHEN: It's horrible.

00:19:47.820 --> 00:19:50.190 align:middle line:84%
So I escaped, and my
mom was still there.

00:19:50.190 --> 00:19:52.170 align:middle line:84%
Basically cursing at
us every single day,

00:19:52.170 --> 00:19:54.500 align:middle line:84%
and my mom was
getting really sick.

00:19:54.500 --> 00:19:56.250 align:middle line:84%
And this is something
they didn't tell me.

00:19:56.250 --> 00:19:59.250 align:middle line:84%
My mom was seeing a doctor
in the nearby hospital in St.

00:19:59.250 --> 00:20:01.800 align:middle line:84%
Louis every single
week, and it turns out

00:20:01.800 --> 00:20:03.120 align:middle line:90%
she had terminal throat cancer.

00:20:03.120 --> 00:20:04.710 align:middle line:90%
And she did literally--

00:20:04.710 --> 00:20:06.810 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Did she ever
speak back to him?

00:20:06.810 --> 00:20:07.170 align:middle line:90%
>>CHEN: No.

00:20:07.170 --> 00:20:07.970 align:middle line:90%
She didn't.

00:20:07.970 --> 00:20:10.208 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: That's the-- that's
why I'm thinking, yeah.

00:20:10.208 --> 00:20:11.250 align:middle line:90%
>>CHEN: She just took it.

00:20:11.250 --> 00:20:13.320 align:middle line:84%
And then, they never
told me about this.

00:20:13.320 --> 00:20:15.120 align:middle line:84%
And then so she was
actually at that time

00:20:15.120 --> 00:20:17.877 align:middle line:84%
practicing another
Qigong meditation.

00:20:17.877 --> 00:20:19.460 align:middle line:84%
And then this Qigong
practice required

00:20:19.460 --> 00:20:22.370 align:middle line:84%
her to send money to the Qigong
master every single week.

00:20:22.370 --> 00:20:25.037 align:middle line:84%
And my dad was getting even more
mad, because he was like, well,

00:20:25.037 --> 00:20:30.540 align:middle line:84%
why are you wasting all our
money on this whackery stuff?

00:20:30.540 --> 00:20:33.170 align:middle line:84%
And so finally, my mom was
like, oh, yeah, this practice

00:20:33.170 --> 00:20:33.970 align:middle line:90%
is not working.

00:20:33.970 --> 00:20:35.950 align:middle line:84%
And then she saw an
ad for Falun Gong.

00:20:35.950 --> 00:20:37.520 align:middle line:90%
And then she called the ad.

00:20:37.520 --> 00:20:40.440 align:middle line:84%
And two people, volunteers, came
in from St. Louis, Missouri,

00:20:40.440 --> 00:20:42.930 align:middle line:84%
spent two days with
us, and taught everyone

00:20:42.930 --> 00:20:45.500 align:middle line:84%
the meditation exercise
completely free,

00:20:45.500 --> 00:20:46.730 align:middle line:90%
and then they left.

00:20:46.730 --> 00:20:48.120 align:middle line:90%
And that's it.

00:20:48.120 --> 00:20:51.080 align:middle line:84%
And then my mom
started practicing.

00:20:51.080 --> 00:20:53.790 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: What is the signature
of it that's so powerful?

00:20:53.790 --> 00:20:55.610 align:middle line:84%
>>CHEN: Well, it's
just the way you feel.

00:20:55.610 --> 00:20:58.010 align:middle line:84%
Like, sometimes, when people
practice the meditation

00:20:58.010 --> 00:21:00.785 align:middle line:84%
exercise for the first time,
they feel such crazy energy.

00:21:00.785 --> 00:21:02.660 align:middle line:84%
And that's what my mom
feel that first night.

00:21:02.660 --> 00:21:06.040 align:middle line:84%
She told me she felt all
the energy in her head,

00:21:06.040 --> 00:21:07.240 align:middle line:90%
not like she's imagining.

00:21:07.240 --> 00:21:08.650 align:middle line:84%
She actually felt
it in her head.

00:21:08.650 --> 00:21:09.450 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:21:09.450 --> 00:21:10.020 align:middle line:90%
>>CHEN: It's my mother.

00:21:10.020 --> 00:21:11.228 align:middle line:90%
I'm going to not believe her.

00:21:11.228 --> 00:21:13.080 align:middle line:84%
So she felt the
energy in her head.

00:21:13.080 --> 00:21:17.270 align:middle line:84%
And then she felt
like somebody was

00:21:17.270 --> 00:21:20.840 align:middle line:84%
almost like ripping her hair
off on another dimension, kind

00:21:20.840 --> 00:21:24.410 align:middle line:90%
of healing her entire upper--

00:21:24.410 --> 00:21:26.570 align:middle line:90%
right here-- upper region here.

00:21:26.570 --> 00:21:28.743 align:middle line:90%
And then she was fine.

00:21:28.743 --> 00:21:29.660 align:middle line:90%
And then she was fine.

00:21:29.660 --> 00:21:30.952 align:middle line:90%
She didn't go back to hospital.

00:21:30.952 --> 00:21:32.270 align:middle line:90%
She was completely fine.

00:21:32.270 --> 00:21:33.500 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Cancer went
into total remission?

00:21:33.500 --> 00:21:33.800 align:middle line:90%
>>CHEN: Yes.

00:21:33.800 --> 00:21:34.600 align:middle line:90%
Completely gone.

00:21:34.600 --> 00:21:35.496 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:21:35.496 --> 00:21:37.190 align:middle line:90%
>>CHEN: And she's been here--

00:21:37.190 --> 00:21:38.530 align:middle line:90%
'99, like 20 years.

00:21:38.530 --> 00:21:39.330 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:21:39.330 --> 00:21:39.940 align:middle line:90%
Yeah, yeah.

00:21:39.940 --> 00:21:40.815 align:middle line:90%
>>CHEN: 20 years now.

00:21:40.815 --> 00:21:43.190 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: OK, which is
amazing, and wonderful,

00:21:43.190 --> 00:21:44.990 align:middle line:84%
and wonderful for you
that you still have

00:21:44.990 --> 00:21:47.330 align:middle line:90%
your gentle-hearted mother.

00:21:47.330 --> 00:21:50.300 align:middle line:84%
But the actual practice
itself, is this something

00:21:50.300 --> 00:21:52.740 align:middle line:84%
that-- because I know our
viewers right now are saying,

00:21:52.740 --> 00:21:54.680 align:middle line:90%
where do we find the Falun Gong?

00:21:54.680 --> 00:21:56.510 align:middle line:84%
So let's just talk
about that for a moment.

00:21:56.510 --> 00:21:59.068 align:middle line:84%
How would people connect, then,
with the Falun Gong practice?

00:21:59.068 --> 00:22:00.860 align:middle line:84%
>>CHEN: The great thing
about this practice

00:22:00.860 --> 00:22:05.420 align:middle line:84%
is that it's 100% free, which
is, like, you never see that.

00:22:05.420 --> 00:22:08.630 align:middle line:84%
So the founder who brought it
out, he doesn't want any money.

00:22:08.630 --> 00:22:09.823 align:middle line:90%
I mean, he prints books.

00:22:09.823 --> 00:22:11.990 align:middle line:10%
So you have to pay for the
books if you want a book.

00:22:11.990 --> 00:22:13.820 align:middle line:10%
But all the stuff
is online for free.

00:22:13.820 --> 00:22:17.080 align:middle line:10%
So you can go online
FalunDafa.org.

00:22:17.080 --> 00:22:18.050 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Dafa, yeah.

00:22:18.050 --> 00:22:19.550 align:middle line:84%
Because the people see
that online and think,

00:22:19.550 --> 00:22:20.752 align:middle line:90%
well, that looks different.

00:22:20.752 --> 00:22:21.710 align:middle line:90%
Is that the same thing?

00:22:21.710 --> 00:22:22.250 align:middle line:90%
>>CHEN: It's the same thing.

00:22:22.250 --> 00:22:23.000 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Falun Dafa.

00:22:23.000 --> 00:22:23.370 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:22:23.370 --> 00:22:24.328 align:middle line:90%
>>CHEN: The Falun Dafa.

00:22:24.328 --> 00:22:26.340 align:middle line:84%
Dafa is the principle,
and the Falun Gong

00:22:26.340 --> 00:22:28.010 align:middle line:84%
is the actual
meditation exercise.

00:22:28.010 --> 00:22:30.290 align:middle line:84%
Because like I said, there's
a Buddhist philosophy

00:22:30.290 --> 00:22:32.130 align:middle line:84%
and principles
connected to it as well.

00:22:32.130 --> 00:22:33.110 align:middle line:90%
So everything's free.

00:22:33.110 --> 00:22:34.520 align:middle line:90%
You can download the exercises.

00:22:34.520 --> 00:22:35.420 align:middle line:90%
You can learn it.

00:22:35.420 --> 00:22:37.730 align:middle line:84%
You can go to any of the
practice sites, which

00:22:37.730 --> 00:22:38.880 align:middle line:90%
are all around the world.

00:22:38.880 --> 00:22:40.130 align:middle line:90%
And people teach you for free.

00:22:40.130 --> 00:22:42.590 align:middle line:84%
You don't have to ever spend
a single penny ever for this.

00:22:42.590 --> 00:22:43.310 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: That's a real story.

00:22:43.310 --> 00:22:44.110 align:middle line:90%
>>CHEN: Yes.

00:22:44.110 --> 00:22:46.443 align:middle line:84%
And that's why it makes
this really something

00:22:46.443 --> 00:22:47.610 align:middle line:90%
different than anybody else.

00:22:47.610 --> 00:22:49.290 align:middle line:84%
Because if you go to
China at that time,

00:22:49.290 --> 00:22:51.140 align:middle line:84%
people were charging
for classes,

00:22:51.140 --> 00:22:52.850 align:middle line:84%
charging for this,
and that, and this.

00:22:52.850 --> 00:22:56.370 align:middle line:84%
But the founder, Mr. Li
Hongzhi, charges nothing.

00:22:56.370 --> 00:22:59.940 align:middle line:84%
And then of course, there's
a lot of bad narratives

00:22:59.940 --> 00:23:01.940 align:middle line:84%
out there started by the
Communist Party saying,

00:23:01.940 --> 00:23:04.460 align:middle line:84%
oh, hey, Falun Gong
practitioners, they're

00:23:04.460 --> 00:23:06.050 align:middle line:90%
all being paid.

00:23:06.050 --> 00:23:08.870 align:middle line:84%
Because we go on parades
to talk about what's

00:23:08.870 --> 00:23:09.878 align:middle line:90%
happening in China.

00:23:09.878 --> 00:23:11.420 align:middle line:84%
And then, oh, they're
all being paid.

00:23:11.420 --> 00:23:13.700 align:middle line:10%
They're all-- like,
no one's paying me.

00:23:13.700 --> 00:23:15.510 align:middle line:90%
I don't get money from anything.

00:23:15.510 --> 00:23:19.230 align:middle line:84%
I just do it out of my
conscience, because I love it.

00:23:19.230 --> 00:23:20.030 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:23:20.030 --> 00:23:20.830 align:middle line:90%
Right.

00:23:20.830 --> 00:23:22.790 align:middle line:84%
And so OK, now
we're going to start

00:23:22.790 --> 00:23:24.320 align:middle line:90%
crossing the story over a bit.

00:23:24.320 --> 00:23:27.710 align:middle line:84%
We're going to go into Chinese
propaganda machines, machinery.

00:23:27.710 --> 00:23:29.050 align:middle line:90%
The 50 Cent-- what's it called?

00:23:29.050 --> 00:23:29.330 align:middle line:90%
Not squad?

00:23:29.330 --> 00:23:29.840 align:middle line:90%
>>CHEN: 50 Cent Army.

00:23:29.840 --> 00:23:30.240 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Army.

00:23:30.240 --> 00:23:31.040 align:middle line:90%
>>CHEN: Sure.

00:23:31.040 --> 00:23:32.030 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: 50 Cent Army.

00:23:32.030 --> 00:23:34.070 align:middle line:84%
We're going to tie it
together with Falun Gong.

00:23:34.070 --> 00:23:34.490 align:middle line:90%
>>CHEN: OK.

00:23:34.490 --> 00:23:36.323 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And we're
going to tie it together

00:23:36.323 --> 00:23:38.780 align:middle line:84%
with an industry that's
pretty darn dark, OK?

00:23:38.780 --> 00:23:39.740 align:middle line:90%
>>CHEN: Sure.

00:23:39.740 --> 00:23:42.597 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So your mother was
able to heal herself of cancer.

00:23:42.597 --> 00:23:44.180 align:middle line:84%
I just want to set
it up a little bit.

00:23:44.180 --> 00:23:46.430 align:middle line:84%
And she told you,
you need to start

00:23:46.430 --> 00:23:47.900 align:middle line:90%
learning this art yourself now.

00:23:47.900 --> 00:23:48.700 align:middle line:90%
>>CHEN: She did.

00:23:48.700 --> 00:23:51.830 align:middle line:84%
She told me I needed to start,
and I rejected it right away.

00:23:51.830 --> 00:23:57.470 align:middle line:84%
Because she kept pushing this
Qigong exercise on me before,

00:23:57.470 --> 00:23:58.610 align:middle line:90%
like, one after another.

00:23:58.610 --> 00:24:00.818 align:middle line:84%
And it got to the point
where I'm just so sick of it.

00:24:00.818 --> 00:24:03.020 align:middle line:84%
I'm like, do not talk to
me about any of this stuff.

00:24:03.020 --> 00:24:04.520 align:middle line:84%
I don't want anything
to do with it.

00:24:04.520 --> 00:24:06.740 align:middle line:84%
But being a Chinese mom,
she's like, no, you have to.

00:24:06.740 --> 00:24:07.000 align:middle line:90%
This is the way to stay.

00:24:07.000 --> 00:24:08.500 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: But you're an
All-American kid at this point.

00:24:08.500 --> 00:24:08.870 align:middle line:90%
>>CHEN: Yeah.

00:24:08.870 --> 00:24:09.450 align:middle line:90%
I'm like leave me alone.

00:24:09.450 --> 00:24:11.720 align:middle line:84%
I need to go and get a pizza
or something like that.

00:24:11.720 --> 00:24:12.960 align:middle line:90%
Leave me alone.

00:24:12.960 --> 00:24:16.460 align:middle line:84%
So I was completely
just rejecting the idea

00:24:16.460 --> 00:24:18.870 align:middle line:84%
until I started having
my own breakdown.

00:24:18.870 --> 00:24:19.670 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Crisis

00:24:19.670 --> 00:24:20.480 align:middle line:90%
>>CHEN: Yeah, in college.

00:24:20.480 --> 00:24:22.010 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Why were
you depressed?

00:24:22.010 --> 00:24:23.718 align:middle line:84%
>>CHEN: It was my
junior year in college.

00:24:23.718 --> 00:24:26.780 align:middle line:84%
And I remember at that point
I knew what I wanted in life.

00:24:26.780 --> 00:24:27.690 align:middle line:90%
I wanted to be--

00:24:27.690 --> 00:24:28.790 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Besides Dim Sum?

00:24:28.790 --> 00:24:30.240 align:middle line:90%
>>CHEN: Besides all the food.

00:24:30.240 --> 00:24:32.190 align:middle line:90%
I wanted to be really popular.

00:24:32.190 --> 00:24:34.520 align:middle line:90%
I wanted to find a great girl.

00:24:34.520 --> 00:24:35.970 align:middle line:90%
Those were my things.

00:24:35.970 --> 00:24:36.770 align:middle line:90%
It was very, like--

00:24:36.770 --> 00:24:38.720 align:middle line:84%
I mean, they're not
huge goals, but they're

00:24:38.720 --> 00:24:39.100 align:middle line:90%
very Midwestern goals.

00:24:39.100 --> 00:24:40.240 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: They're
normal kid goals.

00:24:40.240 --> 00:24:41.040 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:24:41.040 --> 00:24:42.560 align:middle line:84%
>>CHEN: So I wanted
all this stuff.

00:24:42.560 --> 00:24:45.020 align:middle line:84%
And then I remember this
one incident in college

00:24:45.020 --> 00:24:47.920 align:middle line:84%
where I had a friend who I felt
like he really had everything.

00:24:47.920 --> 00:24:50.390 align:middle line:84%
He was a good looking
guy, really popular, great

00:24:50.390 --> 00:24:54.800 align:middle line:84%
girlfriend, and then he
ended up killing himself.

00:24:54.800 --> 00:24:56.110 align:middle line:90%
And after that, I was just--

00:24:56.110 --> 00:24:57.980 align:middle line:84%
it was a big thing
for all of us.

00:24:57.980 --> 00:25:01.070 align:middle line:84%
And then after that I
was like, man, these

00:25:01.070 --> 00:25:04.310 align:middle line:84%
are all things I
really wanted in life.

00:25:04.310 --> 00:25:05.530 align:middle line:90%
And he had it all.

00:25:05.530 --> 00:25:09.710 align:middle line:84%
Then what if I have it all
and I'm still depressed?

00:25:09.710 --> 00:25:11.970 align:middle line:84%
And I just became more
and more depressed.

00:25:11.970 --> 00:25:15.620 align:middle line:84%
And that's when I started
to get into everything

00:25:15.620 --> 00:25:18.885 align:middle line:84%
from parapsychology, I
took a class in hypnosis.

00:25:18.885 --> 00:25:20.260 align:middle line:84%
I was doing all
this stuff to try

00:25:20.260 --> 00:25:23.830 align:middle line:84%
to find what is the
point of being here.

00:25:23.830 --> 00:25:27.625 align:middle line:84%
That was my entire thing
for about two years.

00:25:27.625 --> 00:25:29.500 align:middle line:84%
It got to a point where
I went home and said,

00:25:29.500 --> 00:25:31.990 align:middle line:90%
I want to drop out of college.

00:25:31.990 --> 00:25:33.760 align:middle line:84%
My parents were like
OK, sure, whatever.

00:25:33.760 --> 00:25:34.577 align:middle line:90%
That's fine.

00:25:34.577 --> 00:25:35.535 align:middle line:90%
Because at that point--

00:25:35.535 --> 00:25:36.640 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Didn't
tick your dad off?

00:25:36.640 --> 00:25:37.810 align:middle line:84%
>>CHEN: You know,
that's the great thing

00:25:37.810 --> 00:25:39.480 align:middle line:84%
about this practice
is that, like I said,

00:25:39.480 --> 00:25:41.180 align:middle line:84%
it's based on truthfulness,
compassion, and tolerance.

00:25:41.180 --> 00:25:42.510 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Because they were
both doing it by this point?

00:25:42.510 --> 00:25:44.530 align:middle line:90%
>>CHEN: By that point, my dad--

00:25:44.530 --> 00:25:46.640 align:middle line:84%
he was yelling at my mom
everyday for doing it.

00:25:46.640 --> 00:25:48.348 align:middle line:84%
And at a certain point,
he was just like,

00:25:48.348 --> 00:25:49.348 align:middle line:90%
why she never mad at me?

00:25:49.348 --> 00:25:51.598 align:middle line:84%
And then finally he started
looking into this practice

00:25:51.598 --> 00:25:52.420 align:middle line:90%
as well.

00:25:52.420 --> 00:25:56.155 align:middle line:84%
And now if you meet him,
he's the kindest guy.

00:25:56.155 --> 00:25:57.280 align:middle line:90%
No one would ever suspect--

00:25:57.280 --> 00:25:57.420 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: I love it.

00:25:57.420 --> 00:25:57.660 align:middle line:90%
I love it.

00:25:57.660 --> 00:25:59.620 align:middle line:84%
>>CHEN: --this guy had
a huge, huge temper.

00:25:59.620 --> 00:26:03.390 align:middle line:84%
So he was just
completely changed.

00:26:03.390 --> 00:26:05.140 align:middle line:84%
And then so they were
both encouraging me.

00:26:05.140 --> 00:26:07.780 align:middle line:84%
They were like, well, maybe you
should look into this practice

00:26:07.780 --> 00:26:08.650 align:middle line:90%
as well.

00:26:08.650 --> 00:26:09.530 align:middle line:90%
We're not trying to push you.

00:26:09.530 --> 00:26:10.330 align:middle line:90%
But they were.

00:26:10.330 --> 00:26:11.747 align:middle line:84%
Not trying to push
you, but if you

00:26:11.747 --> 00:26:14.122 align:middle line:84%
need to drop out of college,
take some time, that's fine.

00:26:14.122 --> 00:26:16.310 align:middle line:84%
So finally out I was at
a point where I was like,

00:26:16.310 --> 00:26:17.620 align:middle line:90%
you know what?

00:26:17.620 --> 00:26:18.790 align:middle line:90%
What I got to lose?

00:26:18.790 --> 00:26:21.580 align:middle line:84%
So I read the book more,
and I did the exercise more.

00:26:21.580 --> 00:26:23.450 align:middle line:84%
It's not like
overnight thing for me.

00:26:23.450 --> 00:26:25.180 align:middle line:84%
But after a long
time and interacting

00:26:25.180 --> 00:26:28.310 align:middle line:84%
with the people who practice it,
I was like, well, these people,

00:26:28.310 --> 00:26:29.560 align:middle line:90%
they are so kind.

00:26:29.560 --> 00:26:36.092 align:middle line:84%
And they are so sincere in
their wanting to help you.

00:26:36.092 --> 00:26:38.050 align:middle line:84%
And then I start getting
into it more and more.

00:26:38.050 --> 00:26:40.540 align:middle line:84%
And I realized, well,
this is really incredible.

00:26:40.540 --> 00:26:42.940 align:middle line:84%
And it kind of changed
your entire outlook

00:26:42.940 --> 00:26:46.520 align:middle line:84%
on the purpose of life
and why we're all here.

00:26:46.520 --> 00:26:50.650 align:middle line:84%
And then I became better
and then graduated college.

00:26:50.650 --> 00:26:52.532 align:middle line:84%
Took me five years,
but it happened.

00:26:52.532 --> 00:26:53.365 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: That's OK.

00:26:53.365 --> 00:26:55.540 align:middle line:90%
And you continued practicing?

00:26:55.540 --> 00:26:56.340 align:middle line:90%
>>CHEN: Yeah.

00:26:56.340 --> 00:26:58.160 align:middle line:84%
And I continued
practicing after college.

00:26:58.160 --> 00:27:00.100 align:middle line:84%
I started doing
human rights work.

00:27:00.100 --> 00:27:01.660 align:middle line:84%
So I did that for
about 12 years,

00:27:01.660 --> 00:27:04.990 align:middle line:84%
where just talking about
what was happening in China.

00:27:04.990 --> 00:27:07.390 align:middle line:84%
Because after the practice
became outlawed in China,

00:27:07.390 --> 00:27:09.100 align:middle line:84%
a lot of dark stuff
started happening.

00:27:09.100 --> 00:27:09.520 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:27:09.520 --> 00:27:11.020 align:middle line:84%
And that's where
the story comes in.

00:27:11.020 --> 00:27:14.590 align:middle line:84%
Let's start-- is it appropriate
to jump into the 50 Cent Army?

00:27:14.590 --> 00:27:15.400 align:middle line:90%
>>CHEN: Sure.

00:27:15.400 --> 00:27:17.020 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Let's jump into that.

00:27:17.020 --> 00:27:18.010 align:middle line:84%
>>CHEN: Yeah, I
mean, most people

00:27:18.010 --> 00:27:19.510 align:middle line:84%
don't know what the
50 Cent Army is.

00:27:19.510 --> 00:27:22.870 align:middle line:84%
It's basically internet trolls
being paid by the government.

00:27:22.870 --> 00:27:25.930 align:middle line:84%
It's reported on by every
single major news outlet.

00:27:25.930 --> 00:27:27.390 align:middle line:90%
Sounds like, ooh, movie.

00:27:27.390 --> 00:27:27.730 align:middle line:90%
Sci Fi.

00:27:27.730 --> 00:27:27.900 align:middle line:90%
No.

00:27:27.900 --> 00:27:28.900 align:middle line:90%
It's actually real.

00:27:28.900 --> 00:27:33.100 align:middle line:84%
So they are paid $0.50 per
comment that they make that are

00:27:33.100 --> 00:27:35.558 align:middle line:84%
pro-China or negates
something that--

00:27:35.558 --> 00:27:37.100 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: That's
good money in China.

00:27:37.100 --> 00:27:37.570 align:middle line:90%
>>CHEN: Yeah.

00:27:37.570 --> 00:27:38.170 align:middle line:90%
It's really good money.

00:27:38.170 --> 00:27:39.290 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: You can
make a lot of money.

00:27:39.290 --> 00:27:40.090 align:middle line:90%
>>CHEN: Right.

00:27:40.090 --> 00:27:42.550 align:middle line:84%
So they're on these
videos on YouTube,

00:27:42.550 --> 00:27:46.270 align:middle line:84%
or sites where they
find videos are maybe

00:27:46.270 --> 00:27:48.858 align:middle line:84%
pro-Taiwan independence,
pro-Tibet, and they comment.

00:27:48.858 --> 00:27:49.900 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Pro Falun Gong.

00:27:49.900 --> 00:27:50.860 align:middle line:90%
>>CHEN: Pro-Falun Gong.

00:27:50.860 --> 00:27:53.310 align:middle line:84%
And they will comment,
and comment, and comment.

00:27:53.310 --> 00:27:54.170 align:middle line:90%
That's their job.

00:27:54.170 --> 00:27:54.970 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

00:27:54.970 --> 00:27:58.390 align:middle line:84%
So that's why you'll see a
lot of information online

00:27:58.390 --> 00:28:01.860 align:middle line:84%
that speaks out against
Taiwan, against Tibet,

00:28:01.860 --> 00:28:04.420 align:middle line:84%
and against Falun Gong,
against House Christians.

00:28:04.420 --> 00:28:07.000 align:middle line:84%
And that's mainly
done by these people.

00:28:07.000 --> 00:28:11.080 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So we start
weaving in the illegality

00:28:11.080 --> 00:28:13.160 align:middle line:90%
of the practice in China.

00:28:13.160 --> 00:28:15.880 align:middle line:90%
So there's a severe penalty.

00:28:15.880 --> 00:28:17.710 align:middle line:84%
You can go to prison
for practicing.

00:28:17.710 --> 00:28:18.460 align:middle line:90%
>>CHEN: It's worse than that.

00:28:18.460 --> 00:28:19.260 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:28:19.260 --> 00:28:20.950 align:middle line:84%
And so explain just
how bad it gets

00:28:20.950 --> 00:28:22.520 align:middle line:84%
and how people
have been treated.

00:28:22.520 --> 00:28:23.320 align:middle line:90%
>>CHEN: Right.

00:28:23.320 --> 00:28:27.310 align:middle line:84%
So when the persecution
came, when the footage

00:28:27.310 --> 00:28:29.860 align:middle line:84%
of the Tiananmen
Square immolation

00:28:29.860 --> 00:28:33.010 align:middle line:90%
was everywhere in China--

00:28:33.010 --> 00:28:34.848 align:middle line:84%
by the way, really,
watch this documentary.

00:28:34.848 --> 00:28:36.140 align:middle line:90%
It just doesn't make any sense.

00:28:36.140 --> 00:28:37.030 align:middle line:84%
You're in middle of
Tiananmen Square.

00:28:37.030 --> 00:28:37.950 align:middle line:90%
People lit themselves on fire.

00:28:37.950 --> 00:28:40.617 align:middle line:84%
All of a sudden, cameras show up
and fire extinguishers show up.

00:28:40.617 --> 00:28:41.740 align:middle line:90%
Like, really?

00:28:41.740 --> 00:28:43.200 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And again, that's
"False Fire" on YouTube.

00:28:43.200 --> 00:28:44.367 align:middle line:90%
>>CHEN: "False Fire," right.

00:28:44.367 --> 00:28:47.710 align:middle line:84%
And then so when that
happened, people in China

00:28:47.710 --> 00:28:50.470 align:middle line:84%
were Falun Gong
practitioners were like,

00:28:50.470 --> 00:28:52.180 align:middle line:90%
why are you locking us up?

00:28:52.180 --> 00:28:54.180 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And you're
talking 100 million people?

00:28:54.180 --> 00:28:55.305 align:middle line:90%
>>CHEN: 100 million people.

00:28:55.305 --> 00:28:56.193 align:middle line:90%
So they came out.

00:28:56.193 --> 00:28:57.610 align:middle line:84%
And they went to
Tiananmen Square,

00:28:57.610 --> 00:28:58.480 align:middle line:90%
and they held up banners.

00:28:58.480 --> 00:28:59.397 align:middle line:90%
And it's all peaceful.

00:28:59.397 --> 00:29:01.450 align:middle line:90%
It's saying, Falun Dafa is good.

00:29:01.450 --> 00:29:04.750 align:middle line:84%
Because to them, all right,
this practice, many of them

00:29:04.750 --> 00:29:06.880 align:middle line:84%
believed saved their
lives or made themselves

00:29:06.880 --> 00:29:08.290 align:middle line:90%
a better person.

00:29:08.290 --> 00:29:10.210 align:middle line:84%
Why are you
persecuting a practice

00:29:10.210 --> 00:29:11.320 align:middle line:90%
that makes people better?

00:29:11.320 --> 00:29:12.403 align:middle line:90%
So they didn't understand.

00:29:12.403 --> 00:29:14.230 align:middle line:84%
So they wanted to speak
out for Falun Gong

00:29:14.230 --> 00:29:17.360 align:middle line:84%
and clarify the truth about
what is really happening.

00:29:17.360 --> 00:29:20.080 align:middle line:84%
So they went to Tiananmen, even
people from outside of China,

00:29:20.080 --> 00:29:22.550 align:middle line:84%
like people from America,
from South America,

00:29:22.550 --> 00:29:25.750 align:middle line:84%
they went to Tiananmen, and
they held up banners saying,

00:29:25.750 --> 00:29:27.400 align:middle line:90%
Falun Dafa is good.

00:29:27.400 --> 00:29:30.740 align:middle line:10%
And they were, of course,
arrested right away.

00:29:30.740 --> 00:29:34.000 align:middle line:10%
And when you are
arrested, the only thing

00:29:34.000 --> 00:29:35.710 align:middle line:10%
you need to do to
get out of prison

00:29:35.710 --> 00:29:39.880 align:middle line:10%
is to sign a promise
contract that I'm never going

00:29:39.880 --> 00:29:41.290 align:middle line:10%
to practice Falun Gong again.

00:29:41.290 --> 00:29:42.090 align:middle line:90%
That's it.

00:29:42.090 --> 00:29:43.307 align:middle line:90%
That's all you have to do.

00:29:43.307 --> 00:29:45.640 align:middle line:84%
And then some people are like,
well, why don't they just

00:29:45.640 --> 00:29:47.223 align:middle line:84%
sign it and just go
home and practice?

00:29:47.223 --> 00:29:51.528 align:middle line:84%
Well, I mean, to people who
100% believe that this is right,

00:29:51.528 --> 00:29:53.570 align:middle line:84%
this is not something that
should be persecuted--

00:29:53.570 --> 00:29:54.910 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: It feels like they'd
be betraying themselves, yeah.

00:29:54.910 --> 00:29:56.760 align:middle line:90%
>>CHEN: Exactly.

00:29:56.760 --> 00:29:58.310 align:middle line:90%
And they don't want to do that.

00:29:58.310 --> 00:30:01.120 align:middle line:84%
So that's why-- when
you don't do that,

00:30:01.120 --> 00:30:05.530 align:middle line:84%
there's all sorts of systematic
torture used on you to convince

00:30:05.530 --> 00:30:06.820 align:middle line:90%
you otherwise.

00:30:06.820 --> 00:30:09.070 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: You mean after
they've already arrested you?

00:30:09.070 --> 00:30:09.490 align:middle line:90%
>>CHEN: Yes.

00:30:09.490 --> 00:30:10.540 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Then they
tortured them--

00:30:10.540 --> 00:30:11.290 align:middle line:90%
>>CHEN: They tortured them.

00:30:11.290 --> 00:30:12.400 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: To get them
to sign this document?

00:30:12.400 --> 00:30:13.712 align:middle line:90%
>>CHEN: Exactly.

00:30:13.712 --> 00:30:14.545 align:middle line:90%
This is not made up.

00:30:14.545 --> 00:30:16.170 align:middle line:84%
This Is actually real
documented stuff.

00:30:16.170 --> 00:30:17.072 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:30:17.072 --> 00:30:18.780 align:middle line:84%
>>CHEN: There's things
called labor camps

00:30:18.780 --> 00:30:22.500 align:middle line:84%
in China, where you literally
are making Christmas

00:30:22.500 --> 00:30:24.820 align:middle line:90%
ornaments for no money.

00:30:24.820 --> 00:30:26.070 align:middle line:90%
And you're just doing that.

00:30:26.070 --> 00:30:26.760 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Seriously?

00:30:26.760 --> 00:30:27.240 align:middle line:90%
>>CHEN: Oh, for sure.

00:30:27.240 --> 00:30:28.650 align:middle line:90%
There was even a crazy story.

00:30:28.650 --> 00:30:30.210 align:middle line:84%
I think there was
a couple in Canada.

00:30:30.210 --> 00:30:33.630 align:middle line:84%
They found a letter in a Teddy
Bear or a Christmas ornament.

00:30:33.630 --> 00:30:35.180 align:middle line:90%
I forgot what they bought.

00:30:35.180 --> 00:30:37.110 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Oh,
saying where they--

00:30:37.110 --> 00:30:38.243 align:middle line:84%
>>CHEN: It was from
a prisoner inside one

00:30:38.243 --> 00:30:39.990 align:middle line:84%
of these labor camps saying,
I'm a Falun Gong practitioner.

00:30:39.990 --> 00:30:42.430 align:middle line:84%
I'm being persecuted every
day making this stuff.

00:30:42.430 --> 00:30:44.490 align:middle line:90%
Please help me.

00:30:44.490 --> 00:30:45.990 align:middle line:84%
And then finally
it got to the point

00:30:45.990 --> 00:30:52.680 align:middle line:84%
where people realized that China
has become the number one organ

00:30:52.680 --> 00:30:54.340 align:middle line:84%
destination for people
who need organs.

00:30:54.340 --> 00:30:55.350 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Want to buy organs.

00:30:55.350 --> 00:30:56.558 align:middle line:90%
>>CHEN: And the funny thing--

00:30:56.558 --> 00:30:58.710 align:middle line:84%
not funny, but the crazy
thing-- is in China,

00:30:58.710 --> 00:31:01.257 align:middle line:84%
there's no organ
donation process.

00:31:01.257 --> 00:31:03.840 align:middle line:84%
There's not a driver's license
you sign on the back that says,

00:31:03.840 --> 00:31:05.040 align:middle line:90%
I'm willing to give my organs.

00:31:05.040 --> 00:31:05.880 align:middle line:90%
Doesn't happen.

00:31:05.880 --> 00:31:07.890 align:middle line:84%
And also Chinese
culture, we believe--

00:31:07.890 --> 00:31:10.525 align:middle line:84%
we want to be with
entire body after we die.

00:31:10.525 --> 00:31:11.400 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Well, yeah.

00:31:11.400 --> 00:31:13.700 align:middle line:84%
Your organs have
their own life force

00:31:13.700 --> 00:31:15.310 align:middle line:90%
and their own intelligence.

00:31:15.310 --> 00:31:16.110 align:middle line:90%
>>CHEN: Right.

00:31:16.110 --> 00:31:17.460 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: I mean,
which they do, which

00:31:17.460 --> 00:31:19.440 align:middle line:84%
makes the whole thing
interesting in another way.

00:31:19.440 --> 00:31:20.240 align:middle line:90%
>>CHEN: Right.

00:31:20.240 --> 00:31:22.950 align:middle line:84%
So then China came
out and admitted

00:31:22.950 --> 00:31:26.310 align:middle line:84%
that, OK, we do execute
prisoners and take

00:31:26.310 --> 00:31:27.450 align:middle line:90%
their organs.

00:31:27.450 --> 00:31:29.290 align:middle line:90%
But who are these prisoners?

00:31:29.290 --> 00:31:30.090 align:middle line:90%
All right.

00:31:30.090 --> 00:31:33.570 align:middle line:84%
So Reporters Without Borders,
all these organizations,

00:31:33.570 --> 00:31:38.123 align:middle line:84%
they went in and
started investigating.

00:31:38.123 --> 00:31:39.540 align:middle line:84%
And they realized,
OK, well you're

00:31:39.540 --> 00:31:41.490 align:middle line:84%
not going to take an
organ from an alcoholic.

00:31:41.490 --> 00:31:44.070 align:middle line:84%
You're not going to take an
organ from somebody who's sick

00:31:44.070 --> 00:31:44.920 align:middle line:90%
or whatever.

00:31:44.920 --> 00:31:45.720 align:middle line:90%
Oh, who's healthy?

00:31:45.720 --> 00:31:47.970 align:middle line:84%
Falun Gong practitioners
are really healthy.

00:31:47.970 --> 00:31:51.450 align:middle line:84%
So when you go into these
labor camps, these prisons,

00:31:51.450 --> 00:31:53.540 align:middle line:90%
your blood is tested.

00:31:53.540 --> 00:31:56.670 align:middle line:84%
And then when there's a
match, you're executed.

00:31:56.670 --> 00:31:58.260 align:middle line:90%
Maybe you're not a murderer.

00:31:58.260 --> 00:32:01.157 align:middle line:84%
But you're what they call
a prisoner of conscience,

00:32:01.157 --> 00:32:03.240 align:middle line:84%
which means that you're a
Falun Gong practitioner.

00:32:03.240 --> 00:32:04.115 align:middle line:90%
Maybe you're Tibetan.

00:32:04.115 --> 00:32:06.330 align:middle line:84%
Maybe you're House
Christian, whatever.

00:32:06.330 --> 00:32:07.360 align:middle line:90%
You're executed.

00:32:07.360 --> 00:32:08.510 align:middle line:90%
Your organs are taken.

00:32:08.510 --> 00:32:11.220 align:middle line:84%
And there was even a recorded
conversation with one

00:32:11.220 --> 00:32:14.850 align:middle line:84%
of these doctors, because one
of these reporting organizations

00:32:14.850 --> 00:32:19.560 align:middle line:84%
posed as someone
who needed an organ.

00:32:19.560 --> 00:32:20.760 align:middle line:90%
And they contacted him.

00:32:20.760 --> 00:32:22.570 align:middle line:84%
And they asked him,
OK, I need an organ.

00:32:22.570 --> 00:32:23.370 align:middle line:90%
Do you have it?

00:32:23.370 --> 00:32:23.690 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

00:32:23.690 --> 00:32:25.260 align:middle line:84%
OK, I need it from a
Falun Gong practitioner

00:32:25.260 --> 00:32:26.250 align:middle line:84%
because I heard they
were really healthy.

00:32:26.250 --> 00:32:26.670 align:middle line:90%
Do you have it?

00:32:26.670 --> 00:32:27.720 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

00:32:27.720 --> 00:32:32.497 align:middle line:84%
It's this crazy
monstrosity of a thing

00:32:32.497 --> 00:32:33.580 align:middle line:90%
that's happening in China.

00:32:33.580 --> 00:32:35.130 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: I mean, it's
so sick that no one wants

00:32:35.130 --> 00:32:37.500 align:middle line:84%
to talk about it, which is
why you're asking about it.

00:32:37.500 --> 00:32:37.830 align:middle line:90%
>>CHEN: And nobody does.

00:32:37.830 --> 00:32:38.630 align:middle line:90%
Right.

00:32:38.630 --> 00:32:42.113 align:middle line:84%
And then it came to realize,
OK, well the Bodies Exhibit,

00:32:42.113 --> 00:32:43.530 align:middle line:84%
where are they
getting the bodies?

00:32:43.530 --> 00:32:45.970 align:middle line:84%
They're getting them from
China where the bodies are.

00:32:45.970 --> 00:32:47.420 align:middle line:84%
So it came to
realize, OK, there's

00:32:47.420 --> 00:32:50.430 align:middle line:84%
a lot of bodies who are being
sold that were Falun Gong

00:32:50.430 --> 00:32:51.460 align:middle line:90%
practitioners' bodies.

00:32:51.460 --> 00:32:54.990 align:middle line:84%
Basically, it's an
enterprise profiting off

00:32:54.990 --> 00:32:58.300 align:middle line:84%
people's suffering and death
and is run by the government.

00:32:58.300 --> 00:32:59.100 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:32:59.100 --> 00:33:00.120 align:middle line:90%
That's sick.

00:33:00.120 --> 00:33:01.350 align:middle line:90%
>>CHEN: Yeah.

00:33:01.350 --> 00:33:02.780 align:middle line:90%
To say the least.

00:33:02.780 --> 00:33:08.550 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Well, so has it
dampened the enthusiasm

00:33:08.550 --> 00:33:10.320 align:middle line:90%
of Falun Gong in China?

00:33:10.320 --> 00:33:12.000 align:middle line:84%
Has it been driven
more underground?

00:33:12.000 --> 00:33:13.500 align:middle line:84%
>>CHEN: It's
definitely-- you're not

00:33:13.500 --> 00:33:15.210 align:middle line:84%
going to practice in
public, obviously.

00:33:15.210 --> 00:33:15.900 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah, surely.

00:33:15.900 --> 00:33:18.442 align:middle line:84%
>>CHEN: But people in China who
are Falun Gong practitioners,

00:33:18.442 --> 00:33:21.240 align:middle line:84%
they still do their best to tell
everyone they can about, hey,

00:33:21.240 --> 00:33:22.440 align:middle line:90%
don't misunderstand us.

00:33:22.440 --> 00:33:23.430 align:middle line:90%
We're not crazy.

00:33:23.430 --> 00:33:24.330 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:33:24.330 --> 00:33:25.910 align:middle line:90%
>>CHEN: This is a good practice.

00:33:25.910 --> 00:33:28.285 align:middle line:84%
And the same thing for Falun
Gong practitioners overseas.

00:33:28.285 --> 00:33:29.420 align:middle line:90%
We do the same thing.

00:33:29.420 --> 00:33:30.220 align:middle line:90%
We talk about it.

00:33:30.220 --> 00:33:31.350 align:middle line:90%
I talk about it on my show.

00:33:31.350 --> 00:33:32.970 align:middle line:90%
I'm like, hey, look.

00:33:32.970 --> 00:33:33.960 align:middle line:90%
This is happening.

00:33:33.960 --> 00:33:36.090 align:middle line:84%
People need to be
more aware of it.

00:33:36.090 --> 00:33:39.270 align:middle line:84%
And I've tried to dispel all the
rumors from the 50 Cent Army,

00:33:39.270 --> 00:33:40.913 align:middle line:90%
saying, oh, hey.

00:33:40.913 --> 00:33:41.830 align:middle line:90%
Because I can do that.

00:33:41.830 --> 00:33:45.988 align:middle line:84%
A lot of times when they say,
oh, Falun Gong practitioners,

00:33:45.988 --> 00:33:48.030 align:middle line:84%
you're in this parade
because they're paying you.

00:33:48.030 --> 00:33:52.250 align:middle line:84%
Oh, how much did the Falun Gong
pay you to join this activity?

00:33:52.250 --> 00:33:53.550 align:middle line:90%
No.

00:33:53.550 --> 00:33:55.170 align:middle line:84%
People know what
I do for a living.

00:33:55.170 --> 00:33:56.620 align:middle line:90%
I don't get paid by anybody.

00:33:56.620 --> 00:33:59.460 align:middle line:84%
I do everything because
I want to do it.

00:33:59.460 --> 00:34:00.920 align:middle line:90%
And nobody is getting paid.

00:34:00.920 --> 00:34:04.140 align:middle line:84%
We're here talking
about the atrocities

00:34:04.140 --> 00:34:07.120 align:middle line:84%
because they are atrocities
and we want to change.

00:34:07.120 --> 00:34:09.328 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: There needs to be
more awareness around it.

00:34:09.328 --> 00:34:10.328 align:middle line:90%
>>CHEN: Yes, absolutely.

00:34:10.328 --> 00:34:12.630 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: I mean, if there's
global pressure to stop

00:34:12.630 --> 00:34:13.980 align:middle line:90%
the practice--

00:34:13.980 --> 00:34:14.989 align:middle line:90%
this is huge.

00:34:14.989 --> 00:34:17.384 align:middle line:84%
>>CHEN: Well, I mean,
globally, this practice

00:34:17.384 --> 00:34:20.394 align:middle line:84%
is embraced by every single
country except China.

00:34:20.394 --> 00:34:23.002 align:middle line:90%


00:34:23.002 --> 00:34:24.460 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Well, I
was talking about

00:34:24.460 --> 00:34:29.290 align:middle line:84%
to stop the practice of
executing prisoners for organs.

00:34:29.290 --> 00:34:31.199 align:middle line:84%
I think knowledge
does have some power.

00:34:31.199 --> 00:34:33.000 align:middle line:10%
I mean, human rights groups--

00:34:33.000 --> 00:34:35.730 align:middle line:10%
activists-- can certainly
apply some kind of pressure

00:34:35.730 --> 00:34:36.770 align:middle line:10%
to the government.

00:34:36.770 --> 00:34:37.570 align:middle line:10%
I don't know.

00:34:37.570 --> 00:34:39.330 align:middle line:10%
I mean, can they be
humiliated enough

00:34:39.330 --> 00:34:42.060 align:middle line:10%
to stop it if it's
in their thinking

00:34:42.060 --> 00:34:43.762 align:middle line:10%
if they're profiting from it?

00:34:43.762 --> 00:34:45.429 align:middle line:84%
>>CHEN: I mean, China
is its own animal.

00:34:45.429 --> 00:34:45.840 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah, I know.

00:34:45.840 --> 00:34:46.580 align:middle line:90%
That's what I'm wondering.

00:34:46.580 --> 00:34:47.984 align:middle line:90%
>>CHEN: Everything is shut off.

00:34:47.984 --> 00:34:48.699 align:middle line:84%
Like, information
can't reach China.

00:34:48.699 --> 00:34:50.100 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: --from the
rest of the world.

00:34:50.100 --> 00:34:51.058 align:middle line:90%
>>CHEN: Right, exactly.

00:34:51.058 --> 00:34:52.380 align:middle line:90%
That's a little tougher.

00:34:52.380 --> 00:34:54.752 align:middle line:84%
But like you said, awareness
was really the only way.

00:34:54.752 --> 00:34:55.710 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right, right.

00:34:55.710 --> 00:34:56.199 align:middle line:90%
>>CHEN: So more people know.

00:34:56.199 --> 00:34:57.720 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Well, it's very
brave of you to talk about it,

00:34:57.720 --> 00:34:59.280 align:middle line:90%
because it's really very harsh.

00:34:59.280 --> 00:35:01.890 align:middle line:90%
It's really painful and sad.

00:35:01.890 --> 00:35:04.950 align:middle line:84%
>>CHEN: Well, if
I'm putting myself

00:35:04.950 --> 00:35:07.710 align:middle line:84%
in the position of somebody over
there who my only crime was I

00:35:07.710 --> 00:35:10.408 align:middle line:84%
did a meditation exercise
to help me become a better

00:35:10.408 --> 00:35:12.700 align:middle line:84%
person and healthier person,
and I was thrown in prison

00:35:12.700 --> 00:35:16.810 align:middle line:84%
and tortured for it, I want to
help those people who are still

00:35:16.810 --> 00:35:17.610 align:middle line:90%
being tortured.

00:35:17.610 --> 00:35:18.600 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Absolutely.

00:35:18.600 --> 00:35:19.892 align:middle line:90%
>>CHEN: I want to get them out.

00:35:19.892 --> 00:35:21.030 align:middle line:90%
I want this to stop.

00:35:21.030 --> 00:35:23.095 align:middle line:84%
I want something that
has benefited my family

00:35:23.095 --> 00:35:24.720 align:middle line:84%
so much-- my mom
wouldn't be here today

00:35:24.720 --> 00:35:25.637 align:middle line:90%
if it wasn't for this.

00:35:25.637 --> 00:35:28.080 align:middle line:84%
My dad would still be
screaming at something.

00:35:28.080 --> 00:35:29.065 align:middle line:90%
So I want to help.

00:35:29.065 --> 00:35:31.440 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: I love that you're
doing that, as uncomfortable

00:35:31.440 --> 00:35:33.690 align:middle line:84%
as it is and why we chose
to do that today as well.

00:35:33.690 --> 00:35:36.330 align:middle line:84%
So now you have quite
a number of people

00:35:36.330 --> 00:35:38.580 align:middle line:84%
that have learned about this
that didn't already know.

00:35:38.580 --> 00:35:39.330 align:middle line:90%
>>CHEN: I appreciate that.

00:35:39.330 --> 00:35:41.122 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And now so
what about Falun Gong,

00:35:41.122 --> 00:35:44.610 align:middle line:84%
in terms of its own growth
in America and other places.

00:35:44.610 --> 00:35:46.830 align:middle line:84%
I know it's relatively
little known.

00:35:46.830 --> 00:35:47.850 align:middle line:90%
But is it growing?

00:35:47.850 --> 00:35:48.690 align:middle line:90%
>>CHEN: Yeah.

00:35:48.690 --> 00:35:52.570 align:middle line:84%
Everybody who is in
contact with a practice,

00:35:52.570 --> 00:35:54.580 align:middle line:84%
they really tend to
fall in love with it.

00:35:54.580 --> 00:35:59.100 align:middle line:84%
Because it is something that
is so peaceful and wonderful.

00:35:59.100 --> 00:36:01.900 align:middle line:10%
And I mainly did it because
it helped me destress.

00:36:01.900 --> 00:36:03.660 align:middle line:84%
It just gave me a
different perspective.

00:36:03.660 --> 00:36:06.850 align:middle line:84%
But meditation in general
is just really, really good,

00:36:06.850 --> 00:36:08.370 align:middle line:90%
especially something like this.

00:36:08.370 --> 00:36:10.140 align:middle line:84%
Like I said, I
always tell people

00:36:10.140 --> 00:36:12.130 align:middle line:84%
my main thing when I went
in was, first of all,

00:36:12.130 --> 00:36:12.930 align:middle line:90%
my parents did it.

00:36:12.930 --> 00:36:16.680 align:middle line:84%
And secondly, they
weren't asking for money.

00:36:16.680 --> 00:36:19.560 align:middle line:84%
My mom was used to shelling out
thousands of dollars a month

00:36:19.560 --> 00:36:20.773 align:middle line:90%
for some of these things.

00:36:20.773 --> 00:36:21.690 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: I love that.

00:36:21.690 --> 00:36:22.740 align:middle line:90%
I love this about it.

00:36:22.740 --> 00:36:25.170 align:middle line:84%
I'm really big on that if you
have something that valuable

00:36:25.170 --> 00:36:28.490 align:middle line:84%
if you can give it, if you can
offer it freely to the public,

00:36:28.490 --> 00:36:30.970 align:middle line:84%
if it has value, I'm
totally in support of that.

00:36:30.970 --> 00:36:31.770 align:middle line:90%
>>CHEN: Absolutely.

00:36:31.770 --> 00:36:32.970 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And so is
this a practice--

00:36:32.970 --> 00:36:34.262 align:middle line:90%
how long does it normally take?

00:36:34.262 --> 00:36:35.550 align:middle line:90%
So give us a little idea.

00:36:35.550 --> 00:36:37.500 align:middle line:84%
The physical portions,
I assume, look a little

00:36:37.500 --> 00:36:38.790 align:middle line:90%
like Tai Chi or Qigong?

00:36:38.790 --> 00:36:39.060 align:middle line:90%
>>CHEN: Yes.

00:36:39.060 --> 00:36:40.393 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: It's similar that way?

00:36:40.393 --> 00:36:43.770 align:middle line:84%
Is there a quiet, still
meditative portion as well,

00:36:43.770 --> 00:36:45.730 align:middle line:84%
or is the meditation
built into the movement?

00:36:45.730 --> 00:36:46.530 align:middle line:90%
>>CHEN: Yeah.

00:36:46.530 --> 00:36:51.732 align:middle line:84%
It's basically the main thing
is surrounding your mind,

00:36:51.732 --> 00:36:53.190 align:middle line:84%
which you have to
keep empty, which

00:36:53.190 --> 00:36:55.400 align:middle line:90%
is really hard to do nowadays.

00:36:55.400 --> 00:36:57.190 align:middle line:84%
And then there's five
set of exercises.

00:36:57.190 --> 00:36:59.580 align:middle line:84%
The first four are
very movement driven.

00:36:59.580 --> 00:37:01.230 align:middle line:90%
They're standing exercises.

00:37:01.230 --> 00:37:03.530 align:middle line:84%
And then the last one
is a sitting exercise.

00:37:03.530 --> 00:37:06.423 align:middle line:84%
And you can do it for as
long or as short as you want.

00:37:06.423 --> 00:37:07.840 align:middle line:84%
If you only have
15 minutes a day,

00:37:07.840 --> 00:37:09.007 align:middle line:90%
you can do 15 minutes a day.

00:37:09.007 --> 00:37:12.330 align:middle line:84%
If you want to do
hours a day, you can.

00:37:12.330 --> 00:37:14.070 align:middle line:10%
And then there's a
book of philosophy

00:37:14.070 --> 00:37:16.410 align:middle line:10%
that is complementing it.

00:37:16.410 --> 00:37:17.660 align:middle line:10%
And then you read it.

00:37:17.660 --> 00:37:19.440 align:middle line:10%
It is called "Zhuan
Falun," the book.

00:37:19.440 --> 00:37:22.350 align:middle line:10%
And it goes into the
history of Qigong,

00:37:22.350 --> 00:37:23.730 align:middle line:10%
the history of religion.

00:37:23.730 --> 00:37:26.100 align:middle line:84%
And it's very, very
astonishing book.

00:37:26.100 --> 00:37:26.900 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:37:26.900 --> 00:37:27.280 align:middle line:90%
>>CHEN: Yeah.

00:37:27.280 --> 00:37:28.988 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And the name
of the book again?

00:37:28.988 --> 00:37:30.230 align:middle line:90%
>>CHEN: It's Zhuan Falun.

00:37:30.230 --> 00:37:31.830 align:middle line:10%
>>REGINA: Dra-- how
do you spell it?

00:37:31.830 --> 00:37:32.630 align:middle line:10%
>>CHEN: Z-H-U-N.

00:37:32.630 --> 00:37:33.480 align:middle line:10%
>>REGINA: Z-H-U-N.

00:37:33.480 --> 00:37:34.280 align:middle line:10%
>>CHEN: Uh-huh.

00:37:34.280 --> 00:37:35.626 align:middle line:10%
And then F-A-L-U-N.

00:37:35.626 --> 00:37:37.140 align:middle line:10%
>>REGINA: F-A-L-U-N is the book.

00:37:37.140 --> 00:37:37.940 align:middle line:10%
>>CHEN: Yeah.

00:37:37.940 --> 00:37:40.280 align:middle line:84%
It basically means
turning the wheel.

00:37:40.280 --> 00:37:41.363 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: OK.

00:37:41.363 --> 00:37:43.530 align:middle line:84%
Got it down and so do a lot
of other people watching

00:37:43.530 --> 00:37:45.940 align:middle line:84%
this right now who just
paused it to write it down.

00:37:45.940 --> 00:37:46.990 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:37:46.990 --> 00:37:47.790 align:middle line:90%
All right.

00:37:47.790 --> 00:37:50.700 align:middle line:84%
So now let's look
at how you ended up

00:37:50.700 --> 00:37:53.820 align:middle line:84%
a YouTube phenomenon talking
about all this other phenomena

00:37:53.820 --> 00:37:54.850 align:middle line:90%
that you enjoy.

00:37:54.850 --> 00:37:56.392 align:middle line:84%
And I've watched
some of your videos,

00:37:56.392 --> 00:37:57.700 align:middle line:90%
and you do a really good job.

00:37:57.700 --> 00:37:59.660 align:middle line:84%
I watched one the other
day, in fact, on Atlantis.

00:37:59.660 --> 00:38:00.010 align:middle line:90%
>>CHEN: Oh, thank you.

00:38:00.010 --> 00:38:00.720 align:middle line:90%
Thank you.

00:38:00.720 --> 00:38:02.370 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: It was, did
Atlantis exist, right?

00:38:02.370 --> 00:38:03.170 align:middle line:90%
>>CHEN: Yes.

00:38:03.170 --> 00:38:05.250 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And you throw
in a lot of the known

00:38:05.250 --> 00:38:09.810 align:middle line:84%
philosophies on it, some of
the speculation about it.

00:38:09.810 --> 00:38:12.625 align:middle line:84%
You do-- do you have a team
that edits your pieces for you?

00:38:12.625 --> 00:38:13.425 align:middle line:90%
>>CHEN: I do.

00:38:13.425 --> 00:38:13.710 align:middle line:90%
I do.

00:38:13.710 --> 00:38:14.670 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: They do a good job.

00:38:14.670 --> 00:38:15.670 align:middle line:90%
>>CHEN: Yeah, thank you.

00:38:15.670 --> 00:38:18.380 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: You know, they do
a really nice job visually.

00:38:18.380 --> 00:38:20.520 align:middle line:84%
And then of course, it's
your personality that's

00:38:20.520 --> 00:38:22.020 align:middle line:90%
narrating the whole thing.

00:38:22.020 --> 00:38:25.410 align:middle line:84%
And I think you do a really
beautiful job in taking,

00:38:25.410 --> 00:38:28.380 align:middle line:84%
especially newbies, who,
they're attracted to you--

00:38:28.380 --> 00:38:30.510 align:middle line:84%
maybe they've seen you
and your dumplings and now

00:38:30.510 --> 00:38:32.830 align:middle line:84%
they're crossing
over into Atlantis--

00:38:32.830 --> 00:38:35.790 align:middle line:84%
and taking them really quickly
into the intrigue of something

00:38:35.790 --> 00:38:37.590 align:middle line:84%
they may not have
discovered before.

00:38:37.590 --> 00:38:38.920 align:middle line:90%
>>CHEN: Right.

00:38:38.920 --> 00:38:40.410 align:middle line:84%
And that's something,
like I said,

00:38:40.410 --> 00:38:41.690 align:middle line:90%
I have two passions in life.

00:38:41.690 --> 00:38:44.950 align:middle line:84%
I love eating, and I love
exploring everything else.

00:38:44.950 --> 00:38:46.770 align:middle line:90%
And I feel like it's important.

00:38:46.770 --> 00:38:48.805 align:middle line:84%
Again, this is
not for everybody.

00:38:48.805 --> 00:38:51.180 align:middle line:84%
People are free to believe
whatever they want to believe.

00:38:51.180 --> 00:38:54.107 align:middle line:90%
But for me, it's just really--

00:38:54.107 --> 00:38:56.190 align:middle line:84%
I like the name of your
show, "Keep an Open Mind."

00:38:56.190 --> 00:38:56.390 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:38:56.390 --> 00:38:57.375 align:middle line:84%
>>CHEN: That's what I
always say in my videos.

00:38:57.375 --> 00:38:59.850 align:middle line:84%
Keep an open mind about
things, because there are so

00:38:59.850 --> 00:39:01.730 align:middle line:84%
many things out there
we can't explain.

00:39:01.730 --> 00:39:03.300 align:middle line:90%
There's too many.

00:39:03.300 --> 00:39:06.340 align:middle line:84%
We barely touched
what's in the ocean.

00:39:06.340 --> 00:39:09.660 align:middle line:84%
We've only explored
5%, 10% of it.

00:39:09.660 --> 00:39:15.180 align:middle line:84%
We have no idea what's beyond
eight miles into our own planet

00:39:15.180 --> 00:39:18.220 align:middle line:84%
because we've never been
down there that far.

00:39:18.220 --> 00:39:19.920 align:middle line:84%
So there's so many
things on this Earth

00:39:19.920 --> 00:39:22.950 align:middle line:84%
that we have no
idea why it happens,

00:39:22.950 --> 00:39:26.940 align:middle line:84%
or why does it exist,
or has it ever existed.

00:39:26.940 --> 00:39:29.940 align:middle line:84%
Is the earth really
four billion years old?

00:39:29.940 --> 00:39:33.020 align:middle line:84%
Because that's basically
the oldest piece of--

00:39:33.020 --> 00:39:34.770 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Well, not
according to the Vedas

00:39:34.770 --> 00:39:35.812 align:middle line:90%
and a lot of other folks.

00:39:35.812 --> 00:39:38.010 align:middle line:84%
>>CHEN: So there's so many
things we can question.

00:39:38.010 --> 00:39:41.550 align:middle line:84%
And for me, I just feel like
the world's a greater place

00:39:41.550 --> 00:39:43.680 align:middle line:84%
if we can all keep
an open mind and just

00:39:43.680 --> 00:39:46.137 align:middle line:84%
accept that there are questions
out there that people--

00:39:46.137 --> 00:39:47.220 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Well, I love it.

00:39:47.220 --> 00:39:50.850 align:middle line:84%
And you're taking you're taking
millennials, and younger even,

00:39:50.850 --> 00:39:53.880 align:middle line:84%
early in life into this
because it's so accessible.

00:39:53.880 --> 00:39:55.530 align:middle line:90%
You're not boring anybody.

00:39:55.530 --> 00:39:56.400 align:middle line:90%
Your pieces aren't--

00:39:56.400 --> 00:39:57.120 align:middle line:90%
>>CHEN: Hope not.

00:39:57.120 --> 00:39:58.530 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: No, they
move really fast.

00:39:58.530 --> 00:39:59.370 align:middle line:90%
You talk fast.

00:39:59.370 --> 00:40:01.770 align:middle line:90%
It's like you're on fire.

00:40:01.770 --> 00:40:03.915 align:middle line:84%
You get more in 10
minutes than a documentary

00:40:03.915 --> 00:40:06.390 align:middle line:90%
would get in in an hour.

00:40:06.390 --> 00:40:08.640 align:middle line:84%
And so you're exposing
a lot of people to it.

00:40:08.640 --> 00:40:14.130 align:middle line:84%
And of all these topics, just
maybe give us a clue of some

00:40:14.130 --> 00:40:16.800 align:middle line:84%
that you find particularly
intriguing when it

00:40:16.800 --> 00:40:18.890 align:middle line:90%
comes to the invisible world.

00:40:18.890 --> 00:40:21.890 align:middle line:84%
>>CHEN: I think for
me multiple universes

00:40:21.890 --> 00:40:24.060 align:middle line:90%
is such an interesting topic.

00:40:24.060 --> 00:40:28.670 align:middle line:84%
Because not only is it something
that is incredibly fascinating,

00:40:28.670 --> 00:40:30.470 align:middle line:90%
it's something that is--

00:40:30.470 --> 00:40:33.510 align:middle line:84%
people in the
scientific community,

00:40:33.510 --> 00:40:35.270 align:middle line:84%
many people, many
notable people have

00:40:35.270 --> 00:40:38.000 align:middle line:90%
said that this is the thing.

00:40:38.000 --> 00:40:40.817 align:middle line:84%
This is most likely
something that is real.

00:40:40.817 --> 00:40:42.150 align:middle line:90%
But this is something like the--

00:40:42.150 --> 00:40:44.380 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Well, they recognize
at least 11 dimensions

00:40:44.380 --> 00:40:45.110 align:middle line:90%
at this point.

00:40:45.110 --> 00:40:45.240 align:middle line:90%
You know?

00:40:45.240 --> 00:40:46.460 align:middle line:84%
>>CHEN: I mean,
it's so interesting.

00:40:46.460 --> 00:40:48.043 align:middle line:84%
Because think about
it, there could be

00:40:48.043 --> 00:40:49.370 align:middle line:90%
another version of you and me.

00:40:49.370 --> 00:40:52.070 align:middle line:84%
And we could be
doing something else.

00:40:52.070 --> 00:40:53.528 align:middle line:84%
It's just such a
fascinating topic.

00:40:53.528 --> 00:40:55.820 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And I've often said
that too that, literally,

00:40:55.820 --> 00:40:56.660 align:middle line:90%
you can be holding--

00:40:56.660 --> 00:40:58.970 align:middle line:84%
unknowingly be
holding-- a universe

00:40:58.970 --> 00:41:00.980 align:middle line:84%
in the palm of your
hand on a scale

00:41:00.980 --> 00:41:03.050 align:middle line:84%
that we can't comprehend
in a dimension

00:41:03.050 --> 00:41:04.397 align:middle line:90%
that we can't comprehend.

00:41:04.397 --> 00:41:05.480 align:middle line:90%
>>CHEN: Because you know--

00:41:05.480 --> 00:41:06.950 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: It's all
interpenetrating this,

00:41:06.950 --> 00:41:08.930 align:middle line:84%
and that's what I find
so fascinating about it.

00:41:08.930 --> 00:41:10.790 align:middle line:84%
>>CHEN: And if you look
at different philosophies,

00:41:10.790 --> 00:41:11.960 align:middle line:90%
they all talk about this.

00:41:11.960 --> 00:41:16.040 align:middle line:84%
And according to
Sakamuni, what he said

00:41:16.040 --> 00:41:17.700 align:middle line:90%
was even more incredible.

00:41:17.700 --> 00:41:21.650 align:middle line:84%
He said every grain of
sand has 3,000 universes.

00:41:21.650 --> 00:41:22.650 align:middle line:90%
And then think about it.

00:41:22.650 --> 00:41:26.090 align:middle line:84%
OK, then in those universes,
how much sand is in there?

00:41:26.090 --> 00:41:27.290 align:middle line:90%
It's infinite.

00:41:27.290 --> 00:41:29.985 align:middle line:84%
It could just be more than
we could ever imagine.

00:41:29.985 --> 00:41:30.860 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Absolutely.

00:41:30.860 --> 00:41:33.710 align:middle line:84%
I mean, that's one of my
passions is that exact subject.

00:41:33.710 --> 00:41:36.680 align:middle line:84%
And the whole notion that
when we look out and use

00:41:36.680 --> 00:41:39.002 align:middle line:84%
our fine instrumentation
we've developed

00:41:39.002 --> 00:41:40.460 align:middle line:84%
to this point in
our human history,

00:41:40.460 --> 00:41:44.270 align:middle line:84%
scientifically, and so forth,
our innovative qualities,

00:41:44.270 --> 00:41:48.830 align:middle line:84%
we're only seeing one dimension
of this local universe.

00:41:48.830 --> 00:41:53.270 align:middle line:84%
We're seeing only one
dimension of this one universe.

00:41:53.270 --> 00:41:56.930 align:middle line:84%
And to me, that always
stays in and my awareness

00:41:56.930 --> 00:42:01.490 align:middle line:84%
that there may be a hundred
more of those that are slightly

00:42:01.490 --> 00:42:05.210 align:middle line:84%
phased off by stages,
dimension after dimension

00:42:05.210 --> 00:42:06.560 align:middle line:90%
of the exact same universe.

00:42:06.560 --> 00:42:08.600 align:middle line:84%
And we're just
literally starting

00:42:08.600 --> 00:42:13.470 align:middle line:84%
to grok visually one dimension
of one solar system, one

00:42:13.470 --> 00:42:14.270 align:middle line:90%
universe.

00:42:14.270 --> 00:42:16.520 align:middle line:84%
>>CHEN: If you can put that
in any sort of perspective

00:42:16.520 --> 00:42:19.460 align:middle line:84%
like we are right
now, this is such

00:42:19.460 --> 00:42:24.590 align:middle line:84%
an infinitely small portion of
the grand scheme of existence.

00:42:24.590 --> 00:42:25.790 align:middle line:90%
And that's just fascinating.

00:42:25.790 --> 00:42:28.940 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And it's so
infinitesimal in terms

00:42:28.940 --> 00:42:30.560 align:middle line:84%
of what we're
capable of reaching

00:42:30.560 --> 00:42:32.810 align:middle line:90%
into with our own greater mind.

00:42:32.810 --> 00:42:35.000 align:middle line:84%
And that's where I
find it fascinating.

00:42:35.000 --> 00:42:37.790 align:middle line:10%
Because once your mind can
move beyond this particular

00:42:37.790 --> 00:42:39.750 align:middle line:10%
dimension, there are no rules.

00:42:39.750 --> 00:42:40.550 align:middle line:90%
>>CHEN: Right.

00:42:40.550 --> 00:42:41.758 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Everything is open.

00:42:41.758 --> 00:42:43.640 align:middle line:90%
All knowledge is freely open.

00:42:43.640 --> 00:42:48.020 align:middle line:84%
And as we can start embracing
the notion of multiverses

00:42:48.020 --> 00:42:50.540 align:middle line:84%
and multi-dimensionality,
there should

00:42:50.540 --> 00:42:52.922 align:middle line:84%
be nothing stopping these
little kids being born now.

00:42:52.922 --> 00:42:54.380 align:middle line:84%
If they're born
with that knowledge

00:42:54.380 --> 00:42:58.280 align:middle line:84%
that the mind can reach
into essentially anywhere,

00:42:58.280 --> 00:43:00.650 align:middle line:84%
then everything we need
will be at our fingertips

00:43:00.650 --> 00:43:03.282 align:middle line:84%
within a relatively short period
of time in our human history.

00:43:03.282 --> 00:43:04.490 align:middle line:90%
>>CHEN: Well, that's the key.

00:43:04.490 --> 00:43:06.770 align:middle line:84%
Right now, we're exploring
a lot into outer space.

00:43:06.770 --> 00:43:07.310 align:middle line:90%
And that's great.

00:43:07.310 --> 00:43:07.790 align:middle line:90%
We need to.

00:43:07.790 --> 00:43:08.880 align:middle line:90%
That's awesome.

00:43:08.880 --> 00:43:10.880 align:middle line:84%
But there's so much in here
that we're not even scratching.

00:43:10.880 --> 00:43:11.490 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: The inner dimensions.

00:43:11.490 --> 00:43:11.720 align:middle line:90%
>>CHEN: Yes.

00:43:11.720 --> 00:43:13.350 align:middle line:84%
We're not even
scratching the surface.

00:43:13.350 --> 00:43:14.940 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And it's not really
being encouraged, in fact,

00:43:14.940 --> 00:43:15.710 align:middle line:90%
quite the opposite.

00:43:15.710 --> 00:43:17.543 align:middle line:84%
If you look at what's
happening in the world

00:43:17.543 --> 00:43:21.140 align:middle line:84%
today with the rise of kind of
strong men governmental leaders

00:43:21.140 --> 00:43:25.730 align:middle line:84%
and so forth, and the
rise of the use of media

00:43:25.730 --> 00:43:28.160 align:middle line:84%
more as propaganda
than as educational,

00:43:28.160 --> 00:43:30.930 align:middle line:84%
we're talking about massive
propaganda machines.

00:43:30.930 --> 00:43:32.445 align:middle line:90%
It's not just China.

00:43:32.445 --> 00:43:33.320 align:middle line:90%
It's not just Russia.

00:43:33.320 --> 00:43:34.790 align:middle line:90%
It's the United States.

00:43:34.790 --> 00:43:37.610 align:middle line:84%
It's every country in the
world shutting down our ability

00:43:37.610 --> 00:43:41.060 align:middle line:84%
to perceive, shutting down
our perception of options

00:43:41.060 --> 00:43:45.110 align:middle line:84%
to go with essentially
whatever dogma

00:43:45.110 --> 00:43:48.170 align:middle line:84%
we need to be driven
toward for consumerism

00:43:48.170 --> 00:43:51.640 align:middle line:90%
or to support some agenda.

00:43:51.640 --> 00:43:54.680 align:middle line:84%
I think we were at a very
ticklish point in history

00:43:54.680 --> 00:43:58.190 align:middle line:84%
because of the mass
manipulation of perception.

00:43:58.190 --> 00:43:59.940 align:middle line:90%
>>CHEN: Yeah, I agree with you.

00:43:59.940 --> 00:44:04.050 align:middle line:84%
I mean, I think when humans
were at our best, people think--

00:44:04.050 --> 00:44:04.850 align:middle line:90%
I always say this.

00:44:04.850 --> 00:44:08.030 align:middle line:84%
People think that
thousands of years

00:44:08.030 --> 00:44:11.150 align:middle line:84%
ago or even longer, or
maybe even much longer,

00:44:11.150 --> 00:44:13.910 align:middle line:84%
people were just living
in caves and whatever.

00:44:13.910 --> 00:44:15.280 align:middle line:90%
And they were, but--

00:44:15.280 --> 00:44:16.080 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Or not.

00:44:16.080 --> 00:44:18.360 align:middle line:84%
>>CHEN: Yeah, but I
feel like back then,

00:44:18.360 --> 00:44:21.872 align:middle line:84%
people were really tapped into
something that we are not.

00:44:21.872 --> 00:44:24.080 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Their minds were
free to tap into the world

00:44:24.080 --> 00:44:27.290 align:middle line:84%
around them, through
nature, through the cosmos,

00:44:27.290 --> 00:44:30.260 align:middle line:84%
through interdimensional
relationships with other beings

00:44:30.260 --> 00:44:31.762 align:middle line:90%
that live in other realms.

00:44:31.762 --> 00:44:32.720 align:middle line:90%
That was all available.

00:44:32.720 --> 00:44:33.030 align:middle line:90%
>>CHEN: Yes.

00:44:33.030 --> 00:44:34.405 align:middle line:84%
And there are
certain things that

00:44:34.405 --> 00:44:36.930 align:middle line:84%
were created that we could
never recreate today.

00:44:36.930 --> 00:44:37.730 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Exactly.

00:44:37.730 --> 00:44:41.180 align:middle line:84%
>>CHEN: I mean in China, I
remember-- this is not even

00:44:41.180 --> 00:44:42.920 align:middle line:90%
a legend in China.

00:44:42.920 --> 00:44:46.100 align:middle line:84%
This is something that's
documented in Chinese texts

00:44:46.100 --> 00:44:49.970 align:middle line:84%
is that there are these
medicines created by [CHINESE]

00:44:49.970 --> 00:44:54.260 align:middle line:84%
or what we call, historically,
as like god-like doctors that

00:44:54.260 --> 00:44:57.350 align:middle line:84%
could treat basically
anything from herbs

00:44:57.350 --> 00:44:59.420 align:middle line:90%
and whatever they found.

00:44:59.420 --> 00:45:04.118 align:middle line:84%
And they could take your
pulse with silk, silk threads.

00:45:04.118 --> 00:45:06.410 align:middle line:84%
Because back then, guys
weren't allowed to touch girls.

00:45:06.410 --> 00:45:08.648 align:middle line:84%
And they would
wrap silk threads.

00:45:08.648 --> 00:45:10.190 align:middle line:84%
They would take your
pulse like that.

00:45:10.190 --> 00:45:12.440 align:middle line:84%
And just from that,
they'll know exactly what's

00:45:12.440 --> 00:45:14.030 align:middle line:90%
wrong with their bodies.

00:45:14.030 --> 00:45:17.810 align:middle line:84%
I mean, people laugh at
holistic medicine sometimes.

00:45:17.810 --> 00:45:19.670 align:middle line:90%
Oh, you believe in acupuncture.

00:45:19.670 --> 00:45:22.515 align:middle line:84%
This is how people
treated illnesses back--

00:45:22.515 --> 00:45:27.060 align:middle line:84%
and at least in China, it
was so incredibly efficient.

00:45:27.060 --> 00:45:28.920 align:middle line:84%
So I mean, I think we
lose a lot of that.

00:45:28.920 --> 00:45:29.720 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: We have.

00:45:29.720 --> 00:45:32.690 align:middle line:84%
And so it's up to
people like yourself,

00:45:32.690 --> 00:45:35.030 align:middle line:84%
anybody who is out
there with an open mind

00:45:35.030 --> 00:45:38.930 align:middle line:84%
trying to openly explore without
having preconceived answers,

00:45:38.930 --> 00:45:41.870 align:middle line:84%
but genuine, open-minded
exploration where we genuinely

00:45:41.870 --> 00:45:46.130 align:middle line:84%
can leave people with the notion
that there are many potentials.

00:45:46.130 --> 00:45:48.350 align:middle line:84%
There are many
potentials in terms

00:45:48.350 --> 00:45:52.620 align:middle line:84%
of what's driving the phenomena,
or what the outcome of it

00:45:52.620 --> 00:45:53.420 align:middle line:90%
can be.

00:45:53.420 --> 00:45:55.200 align:middle line:84%
Are you comfortable
in that arena?

00:45:55.200 --> 00:45:56.000 align:middle line:90%
>>CHEN: Yeah.

00:45:56.000 --> 00:45:59.690 align:middle line:84%
I feel like, in general,
people just need something

00:45:59.690 --> 00:46:01.430 align:middle line:90%
to give them a little nudge.

00:46:01.430 --> 00:46:04.910 align:middle line:84%
What I don't like how
the world has become

00:46:04.910 --> 00:46:09.650 align:middle line:84%
is that nowadays, when you
believe in something, anything,

00:46:09.650 --> 00:46:11.810 align:middle line:84%
I feel like a lot of times
you're mocked for it.

00:46:11.810 --> 00:46:12.120 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Oh, yeah.

00:46:12.120 --> 00:46:12.250 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:46:12.250 --> 00:46:12.530 align:middle line:90%
Definitely.

00:46:12.530 --> 00:46:12.590 align:middle line:90%
>>CHEN: Yeah.

00:46:12.590 --> 00:46:14.870 align:middle line:84%
I mean, it could be as simple
as believing in a religion

00:46:14.870 --> 00:46:17.540 align:middle line:84%
or believing-- like, I feel like
nowadays it's almost like cool

00:46:17.540 --> 00:46:18.330 align:middle line:90%
to not believe in anything.

00:46:18.330 --> 00:46:19.872 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Well, the
world in general,

00:46:19.872 --> 00:46:21.530 align:middle line:84%
the trend is toward
atheism globally.

00:46:21.530 --> 00:46:24.890 align:middle line:84%
So that is part
of it, which does

00:46:24.890 --> 00:46:27.420 align:middle line:90%
negate the nature of reality.

00:46:27.420 --> 00:46:28.220 align:middle line:90%
>>CHEN: Right.

00:46:28.220 --> 00:46:33.100 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: It negates the unseen
world, which is 98% of reality.

00:46:33.100 --> 00:46:35.930 align:middle line:84%
You cannot see what
drives and creates.

00:46:35.930 --> 00:46:39.720 align:middle line:84%
And so I can understand
where it's coming from,

00:46:39.720 --> 00:46:42.960 align:middle line:84%
but it's an incredibly
cynical move for humanity.

00:46:42.960 --> 00:46:43.760 align:middle line:90%
>>CHEN: Right.

00:46:43.760 --> 00:46:45.170 align:middle line:90%
I 100% agree.

00:46:45.170 --> 00:46:47.690 align:middle line:84%
And just from the
perspective, OK,

00:46:47.690 --> 00:46:50.990 align:middle line:84%
let's just be open to
what people believe in.

00:46:50.990 --> 00:46:53.940 align:middle line:84%
I mean, reincarnation is
not even like a theory.

00:46:53.940 --> 00:46:56.690 align:middle line:90%
It's a fact for some cultures.

00:46:56.690 --> 00:46:58.410 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Pretty
much for me, too.

00:46:58.410 --> 00:46:58.610 align:middle line:90%
>>CHEN: Right.

00:46:58.610 --> 00:46:58.850 align:middle line:90%
Right.

00:46:58.850 --> 00:46:59.370 align:middle line:90%
And me as well.

00:46:59.370 --> 00:47:00.500 align:middle line:90%
I 100% believe in that.

00:47:00.500 --> 00:47:03.170 align:middle line:84%
In Chinese culture,
that's what we believe.

00:47:03.170 --> 00:47:06.950 align:middle line:84%
But I feel like nowadays when
I talk about on the show,

00:47:06.950 --> 00:47:11.810 align:middle line:84%
I always say, don't close
the book on anything.

00:47:11.810 --> 00:47:15.400 align:middle line:84%
Don't mock other
people about anything.

00:47:15.400 --> 00:47:18.150 align:middle line:84%
Just accept that they
believe in something.

00:47:18.150 --> 00:47:19.400 align:middle line:90%
And take a little bit from it.

00:47:19.400 --> 00:47:21.752 align:middle line:84%
If you can gain something,
that's fantastic.

00:47:21.752 --> 00:47:23.210 align:middle line:84%
If you don't believe
it, OK, that's

00:47:23.210 --> 00:47:24.320 align:middle line:90%
your prerogative as well.

00:47:24.320 --> 00:47:25.330 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:47:25.330 --> 00:47:27.230 align:middle line:84%
To just encourage
people to remain

00:47:27.230 --> 00:47:28.390 align:middle line:90%
respectful of one another.

00:47:28.390 --> 00:47:29.470 align:middle line:90%
It's so important.

00:47:29.470 --> 00:47:30.270 align:middle line:90%
>>CHEN: Yeah.

00:47:30.270 --> 00:47:33.080 align:middle line:84%
And it is funny,
but nowadays, when

00:47:33.080 --> 00:47:36.470 align:middle line:84%
people say, oh, you believe
in aliens, you crackhead.

00:47:36.470 --> 00:47:37.280 align:middle line:90%
What?

00:47:37.280 --> 00:47:37.970 align:middle line:90%
I'm sorry.

00:47:37.970 --> 00:47:39.803 align:middle line:84%
Do you really believe
we're the only people?

00:47:39.803 --> 00:47:40.770 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: I know.

00:47:40.770 --> 00:47:42.260 align:middle line:90%
I cover it a lot.

00:47:42.260 --> 00:47:43.970 align:middle line:90%
Yeah, exactly.

00:47:43.970 --> 00:47:45.522 align:middle line:90%
So you get into that.

00:47:45.522 --> 00:47:46.980 align:middle line:84%
Do you get into
parallel realities?

00:47:46.980 --> 00:47:47.780 align:middle line:90%
>>CHEN: Yeah.

00:47:47.780 --> 00:47:49.490 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: The Mandela effect?

00:47:49.490 --> 00:47:51.650 align:middle line:84%
Where do you get
the most pushback?

00:47:51.650 --> 00:47:54.938 align:middle line:84%
Because Gaia is
really a closed loop.

00:47:54.938 --> 00:47:57.230 align:middle line:84%
You have people that are
coming because they're already

00:47:57.230 --> 00:48:00.170 align:middle line:84%
searching for something
beyond the average.

00:48:00.170 --> 00:48:02.940 align:middle line:84%
So our audience is familiar
with and comfortable with a lot

00:48:02.940 --> 00:48:03.740 align:middle line:90%
of these things.

00:48:03.740 --> 00:48:03.920 align:middle line:90%
>>CHEN: Yes.

00:48:03.920 --> 00:48:05.900 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: But you're
talking to millions

00:48:05.900 --> 00:48:09.860 align:middle line:84%
of people who have never been
exposed to these things, which

00:48:09.860 --> 00:48:12.560 align:middle line:84%
is I totally,
totally respect what

00:48:12.560 --> 00:48:15.440 align:middle line:84%
you're doing to make that
crossover to the mainstream

00:48:15.440 --> 00:48:16.340 align:middle line:90%
audience.

00:48:16.340 --> 00:48:18.882 align:middle line:84%
Where do you find
the most pushback?

00:48:18.882 --> 00:48:20.840 align:middle line:84%
What kind of subjects
you get the most pushback

00:48:20.840 --> 00:48:22.370 align:middle line:90%
from the mainstream audience on?

00:48:22.370 --> 00:48:27.660 align:middle line:84%
>>CHEN: I think a lot has to do
with real prehistoric history.

00:48:27.660 --> 00:48:28.770 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Oh, interesting.

00:48:28.770 --> 00:48:31.520 align:middle line:84%
>>CHEN: Because I'm a big
believer that Earth is not

00:48:31.520 --> 00:48:32.700 align:middle line:90%
just four billion years old.

00:48:32.700 --> 00:48:33.500 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:48:33.500 --> 00:48:34.875 align:middle line:84%
>>CHEN: There are
people who have

00:48:34.875 --> 00:48:38.080 align:middle line:84%
existed with advanced
technology time and time again.

00:48:38.080 --> 00:48:40.460 align:middle line:84%
I mean, even now, if our
entire society was wiped out

00:48:40.460 --> 00:48:44.780 align:middle line:84%
by flood, in about 1,000 years,
you're not going to see much.

00:48:44.780 --> 00:48:46.410 align:middle line:84%
I really believe
a lot of the stuff

00:48:46.410 --> 00:48:50.690 align:middle line:84%
that we can't fathom, a lot of
the ancient sites like "Sexy

00:48:50.690 --> 00:48:52.610 align:middle line:84%
Woman" in Peru,
like how did they

00:48:52.610 --> 00:48:56.270 align:middle line:84%
move these 8-ton
boulders carved perfectly

00:48:56.270 --> 00:48:58.670 align:middle line:84%
where a little slip of paper
can't even get through.

00:48:58.670 --> 00:49:01.790 align:middle line:84%
How did they move that up
a mountain with horses?

00:49:01.790 --> 00:49:04.280 align:middle line:84%
And seriously, pyramids
and how we built them.

00:49:04.280 --> 00:49:07.600 align:middle line:84%
We still are trying to
come up with explanations.

00:49:07.600 --> 00:49:09.500 align:middle line:84%
Whenever I publish a
video about pyramids,

00:49:09.500 --> 00:49:13.640 align:middle line:84%
maybe let's consider the concept
that maybe a previous, very

00:49:13.640 --> 00:49:16.250 align:middle line:84%
advanced civilization
created them,

00:49:16.250 --> 00:49:18.530 align:middle line:84%
and then of course, it's
like every year there's

00:49:18.530 --> 00:49:19.970 align:middle line:90%
always a scientific report.

00:49:19.970 --> 00:49:22.020 align:middle line:84%
The mystery of the
pyramid has been solved.

00:49:22.020 --> 00:49:23.923 align:middle line:90%
It is with logs this time.

00:49:23.923 --> 00:49:24.840 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes, I know.

00:49:24.840 --> 00:49:25.245 align:middle line:90%
>>CHEN: Like, seriously.

00:49:25.245 --> 00:49:27.200 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: It always makes
you laugh to read that.

00:49:27.200 --> 00:49:28.000 align:middle line:90%
>>CHEN: Right.

00:49:28.000 --> 00:49:30.860 align:middle line:84%
So I feel like
history is something

00:49:30.860 --> 00:49:32.600 align:middle line:84%
that, at least in
our classrooms,

00:49:32.600 --> 00:49:34.415 align:middle line:84%
we put a pretty
closed loop on that.

00:49:34.415 --> 00:49:35.290 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Absolutely.

00:49:35.290 --> 00:49:37.500 align:middle line:84%
>>CHEN: Like this
is exactly history.

00:49:37.500 --> 00:49:38.300 align:middle line:90%
OK?

00:49:38.300 --> 00:49:41.360 align:middle line:84%
From here to here, we
were little creatures

00:49:41.360 --> 00:49:42.680 align:middle line:90%
swimming in the ocean.

00:49:42.680 --> 00:49:44.780 align:middle line:84%
Like from here to here,
we were eating raw meats.

00:49:44.780 --> 00:49:45.740 align:middle line:90%
From here to here--

00:49:45.740 --> 00:49:46.550 align:middle line:90%
it's very closed.

00:49:46.550 --> 00:49:47.230 align:middle line:90%
Like, this is it.

00:49:47.230 --> 00:49:48.050 align:middle line:90%
Believe that.

00:49:48.050 --> 00:49:51.290 align:middle line:84%
But this is so much
evidence out there,

00:49:51.290 --> 00:49:55.520 align:middle line:84%
like they found a
nuclear reactor,

00:49:55.520 --> 00:49:58.910 align:middle line:84%
like a natural nuclear
reactor in Gabon Republic.

00:49:58.910 --> 00:50:02.452 align:middle line:84%
And now a lot of people are
saying, oh, it's just natural.

00:50:02.452 --> 00:50:04.160 align:middle line:84%
But there are a lot
of experts were like,

00:50:04.160 --> 00:50:05.670 align:middle line:90%
this cannot be natural.

00:50:05.670 --> 00:50:06.470 align:middle line:90%
This cannot be.

00:50:06.470 --> 00:50:10.910 align:middle line:84%
It needs to be so, so
precise for this to happen.

00:50:10.910 --> 00:50:14.370 align:middle line:84%
It just cannot be something
that just happened.

00:50:14.370 --> 00:50:15.630 align:middle line:90%
It's only one in the world.

00:50:15.630 --> 00:50:17.797 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Yeah, the problem
is you have institutions

00:50:17.797 --> 00:50:20.580 align:middle line:84%
that are completely tied to
their sustenance of hanging

00:50:20.580 --> 00:50:21.570 align:middle line:90%
onto the old stories.

00:50:21.570 --> 00:50:21.960 align:middle line:90%
>>CHEN: Right.

00:50:21.960 --> 00:50:24.043 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: You have all the
people involved, tenure

00:50:24.043 --> 00:50:26.855 align:middle line:84%
and so forth, having to
be closed-lipped and, even

00:50:26.855 --> 00:50:28.480 align:middle line:84%
if they believe
differently, hanging on

00:50:28.480 --> 00:50:29.355 align:middle line:90%
to their old stories.

00:50:29.355 --> 00:50:30.640 align:middle line:90%
And this is global.

00:50:30.640 --> 00:50:31.440 align:middle line:90%
It's global.

00:50:31.440 --> 00:50:33.780 align:middle line:84%
So until the little kids
being born right now,

00:50:33.780 --> 00:50:36.030 align:middle line:84%
the little ones there are
really different-- you know,

00:50:36.030 --> 00:50:37.920 align:middle line:84%
you can see they're
really different--

00:50:37.920 --> 00:50:40.090 align:middle line:84%
until they come in and
say, I don't believe you.

00:50:40.090 --> 00:50:42.330 align:middle line:84%
In fact, I see something
different in my own mind.

00:50:42.330 --> 00:50:43.717 align:middle line:90%
Then everything starts changing.

00:50:43.717 --> 00:50:45.300 align:middle line:84%
It's just going to
take a little time.

00:50:45.300 --> 00:50:48.780 align:middle line:84%
Because we've got to stop
the support of institutions

00:50:48.780 --> 00:50:51.120 align:middle line:84%
that are vested in
maintaining old stories.

00:50:51.120 --> 00:50:52.537 align:middle line:84%
And that's all of
them for money--

00:50:52.537 --> 00:50:53.662 align:middle line:90%
>>CHEN: Yes, unfortunately.

00:50:53.662 --> 00:50:55.545 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: To history
to all of it.

00:50:55.545 --> 00:50:56.670 align:middle line:90%
>>CHEN: Unfortunately, yes.

00:50:56.670 --> 00:50:58.545 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Yeah, and
especially our own health

00:50:58.545 --> 00:51:01.020 align:middle line:84%
and our bodies with scientific
materialism and so forth.

00:51:01.020 --> 00:51:04.700 align:middle line:84%
So you're totally, like I
said, you're a soul brother.

00:51:04.700 --> 00:51:06.510 align:middle line:84%
We're on the same
track on this trying

00:51:06.510 --> 00:51:09.000 align:middle line:84%
to just bring these questions
up and these possibilities.

00:51:09.000 --> 00:51:12.840 align:middle line:84%
And in fact, we're going to
go on a wonderful exploration

00:51:12.840 --> 00:51:18.780 align:middle line:84%
soon to a culture that's little
known and look at, potentially,

00:51:18.780 --> 00:51:21.780 align:middle line:84%
some bones, but also
look at the architecture.

00:51:21.780 --> 00:51:24.640 align:middle line:84%
And again, the same thing, where
did these people come from?

00:51:24.640 --> 00:51:25.440 align:middle line:90%
Who were they?

00:51:25.440 --> 00:51:27.815 align:middle line:84%
And that's why I like the fact
that you covered Atlantis.

00:51:27.815 --> 00:51:30.630 align:middle line:84%
Because if you had a
sophisticated culture then,

00:51:30.630 --> 00:51:33.470 align:middle line:84%
and if you go along with
the hermetic point of view,

00:51:33.470 --> 00:51:35.810 align:middle line:84%
the hermetics are very clear
that the knowledge that

00:51:35.810 --> 00:51:37.560 align:middle line:84%
was passed on through
the hermetic lineage

00:51:37.560 --> 00:51:40.530 align:middle line:84%
is from Atlantian
times, very advanced,

00:51:40.530 --> 00:51:42.180 align:middle line:90%
early Atlantian times.

00:51:42.180 --> 00:51:44.240 align:middle line:90%
We're going back very, very far.

00:51:44.240 --> 00:51:47.160 align:middle line:84%
And in their perspective, for
example, the Great Pyramid

00:51:47.160 --> 00:51:49.350 align:middle line:90%
is 85,000 years old.

00:51:49.350 --> 00:51:53.130 align:middle line:84%
When Robert Schoch is
privately talking and not

00:51:53.130 --> 00:51:55.560 align:middle line:84%
having to protect
his information,

00:51:55.560 --> 00:51:58.410 align:middle line:84%
he'll say when he first saw
it, his instinct and feeling

00:51:58.410 --> 00:52:01.510 align:middle line:84%
was the Great Pyramid
is 100,000 years old.

00:52:01.510 --> 00:52:02.310 align:middle line:90%
You know?

00:52:02.310 --> 00:52:04.590 align:middle line:84%
John Anthony West, when I
interviewed him years ago,

00:52:04.590 --> 00:52:06.690 align:middle line:84%
was the only one
sticking his neck out

00:52:06.690 --> 00:52:09.120 align:middle line:90%
at all, was like 35,000 years.

00:52:09.120 --> 00:52:11.820 align:middle line:84%
Well, what was going on
the planet at that time?

00:52:11.820 --> 00:52:16.780 align:middle line:84%
And this is still all relatively
close in its modern history.

00:52:16.780 --> 00:52:18.460 align:middle line:84%
100,000 years is
really modern history.

00:52:18.460 --> 00:52:19.260 align:middle line:90%
>>CHEN: Right.

00:52:19.260 --> 00:52:21.600 align:middle line:84%
But we have no documents,
because documented history

00:52:21.600 --> 00:52:23.280 align:middle line:90%
is only 5,000, 6,000 years.

00:52:23.280 --> 00:52:24.180 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Exactly.

00:52:24.180 --> 00:52:27.510 align:middle line:84%
And again, the more you go under
the sands around the world,

00:52:27.510 --> 00:52:30.120 align:middle line:84%
the more we find these
sophisticated structures

00:52:30.120 --> 00:52:32.460 align:middle line:84%
around the world, the story
will start being revealed.

00:52:32.460 --> 00:52:34.320 align:middle line:84%
So it's a fascinating
time to be alive.

00:52:34.320 --> 00:52:36.930 align:middle line:84%
Because technology-- and I
know some people using it,

00:52:36.930 --> 00:52:38.730 align:middle line:90%
they try to stay off the radar--

00:52:38.730 --> 00:52:41.970 align:middle line:84%
they're detecting what goes
down a couple hundred feet.

00:52:41.970 --> 00:52:44.810 align:middle line:90%
That's a whole different story.

00:52:44.810 --> 00:52:46.530 align:middle line:90%
>>CHEN: Well, that's great.

00:52:46.530 --> 00:52:49.532 align:middle line:84%
And then the other thing is if
they find something, when they

00:52:49.532 --> 00:52:50.990 align:middle line:84%
find something,
what are they going

00:52:50.990 --> 00:52:51.720 align:middle line:90%
to do with that information?

00:52:51.720 --> 00:52:52.640 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: What are you
going to do with it?

00:52:52.640 --> 00:52:54.510 align:middle line:84%
Yeah, because that's
a significant dig

00:52:54.510 --> 00:52:56.218 align:middle line:84%
if you're going that
far under the Earth.

00:52:56.218 --> 00:52:58.468 align:middle line:84%
>>CHEN: Are they going to
change every single thing we

00:52:58.468 --> 00:52:59.812 align:middle line:90%
know about history and science?

00:52:59.812 --> 00:53:01.770 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Well, that
comes to us and our minds.

00:53:01.770 --> 00:53:04.830 align:middle line:84%
When we're ready to disconnect
from official stories

00:53:04.830 --> 00:53:08.200 align:middle line:84%
and go on our own intuition,
our own intelligence,

00:53:08.200 --> 00:53:12.328 align:middle line:84%
including, to a degree,
our own education, and say,

00:53:12.328 --> 00:53:14.370 align:middle line:84%
a different story is
emerging for me on this one.

00:53:14.370 --> 00:53:15.600 align:middle line:90%
I don't buy the old one anymore.

00:53:15.600 --> 00:53:16.110 align:middle line:90%
>>CHEN: Right.

00:53:16.110 --> 00:53:17.720 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And that's what
you're helping people do.

00:53:17.720 --> 00:53:18.690 align:middle line:84%
>>CHEN: I think that's
what you're doing.

00:53:18.690 --> 00:53:19.830 align:middle line:84%
And I think what
that's Gaia's doing.

00:53:19.830 --> 00:53:21.210 align:middle line:90%
I think that it's needed.

00:53:21.210 --> 00:53:23.340 align:middle line:84%
Because people need
to be open to that.

00:53:23.340 --> 00:53:24.360 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Absolutely.

00:53:24.360 --> 00:53:28.080 align:middle line:84%
So what I want to find out
about now, because now we know

00:53:28.080 --> 00:53:30.870 align:middle line:84%
"Beyond Science" is
where they can find you.

00:53:30.870 --> 00:53:32.610 align:middle line:84%
Let's talk about
your other site.

00:53:32.610 --> 00:53:35.130 align:middle line:84%
And I have to say that this
conversation is personally

00:53:35.130 --> 00:53:39.330 align:middle line:84%
inspiring to me, because
I've been really looking

00:53:39.330 --> 00:53:41.580 align:middle line:84%
at-- and I've just started
producing a few of them--

00:53:41.580 --> 00:53:44.700 align:middle line:84%
looking at getting back
to my cooking roots

00:53:44.700 --> 00:53:48.390 align:middle line:84%
and starting to offer some
of that alongside this work

00:53:48.390 --> 00:53:49.283 align:middle line:90%
that I do.

00:53:49.283 --> 00:53:50.700 align:middle line:84%
Because those are
my two passions.

00:53:50.700 --> 00:53:51.390 align:middle line:90%
>>CHEN: Yeah.

00:53:51.390 --> 00:53:52.223 align:middle line:90%
That's why we click.

00:53:52.223 --> 00:53:54.810 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And I thought, how
do I bridge these two worlds?

00:53:54.810 --> 00:53:57.150 align:middle line:84%
And I'm hearing from you, you
don't need to bridge them.

00:53:57.150 --> 00:53:57.930 align:middle line:90%
Just do them.

00:53:57.930 --> 00:53:58.930 align:middle line:90%
>>CHEN: Yeah, seriously.

00:53:58.930 --> 00:54:00.990 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So I
don't need to make

00:54:00.990 --> 00:54:03.580 align:middle line:84%
some kind of wonderful
segue from one to the other.

00:54:03.580 --> 00:54:04.380 align:middle line:90%
>>CHEN: No.

00:54:04.380 --> 00:54:04.680 align:middle line:90%
I mean.

00:54:04.680 --> 00:54:05.430 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Just do it.

00:54:05.430 --> 00:54:06.680 align:middle line:90%
>>CHEN: People need to eat.

00:54:06.680 --> 00:54:07.490 align:middle line:90%
Everybody eats.

00:54:07.490 --> 00:54:07.800 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Exactly.

00:54:07.800 --> 00:54:08.730 align:middle line:90%
So you've inspired me.

00:54:08.730 --> 00:54:11.440 align:middle line:84%
So I'm going to go larger
than I had expected to.

00:54:11.440 --> 00:54:12.440 align:middle line:90%
And I'll just go for it.

00:54:12.440 --> 00:54:13.470 align:middle line:84%
>>CHEN: Well, I'm
excited for you.

00:54:13.470 --> 00:54:15.055 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: But meanwhile,
let's get back to dumplings.

00:54:15.055 --> 00:54:15.380 align:middle line:90%
>>CHEN: Sure, sure.

00:54:15.380 --> 00:54:17.130 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: You know,
something people love.

00:54:17.130 --> 00:54:19.767 align:middle line:84%
And so your other site,
your food site is called--

00:54:19.767 --> 00:54:20.850 align:middle line:90%
>>CHEN: Strictly Dumpling.

00:54:20.850 --> 00:54:21.810 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Strictly Dumpling.

00:54:21.810 --> 00:54:23.393 align:middle line:84%
>>CHEN: I do eat
other stuff, but it's

00:54:23.393 --> 00:54:24.790 align:middle line:90%
called Strictly Dumpling.

00:54:24.790 --> 00:54:26.820 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And so your
passion for dumpling

00:54:26.820 --> 00:54:29.670 align:middle line:84%
is that you can basically
film with anything, right?

00:54:29.670 --> 00:54:30.550 align:middle line:90%
>>CHEN: Yes, yes.

00:54:30.550 --> 00:54:31.350 align:middle line:90%
Absolutely.

00:54:31.350 --> 00:54:34.032 align:middle line:84%
I mean, it's
definitely a site where

00:54:34.032 --> 00:54:35.490 align:middle line:84%
I think when it
started I was like,

00:54:35.490 --> 00:54:36.960 align:middle line:84%
what do I love
most in the world?

00:54:36.960 --> 00:54:37.950 align:middle line:90%
Dumpling.

00:54:37.950 --> 00:54:41.070 align:middle line:84%
And I feel like dumpling
is the best representation

00:54:41.070 --> 00:54:43.800 align:middle line:84%
of Chinese culture, because
it's a historical food

00:54:43.800 --> 00:54:45.660 align:middle line:84%
with a beautiful
legend behind it.

00:54:45.660 --> 00:54:48.270 align:middle line:84%
It's something we
eat all the time.

00:54:48.270 --> 00:54:51.210 align:middle line:84%
On holidays, on birthdays,
on special occasions,

00:54:51.210 --> 00:54:54.450 align:middle line:84%
or just randomly, it's
a great social event

00:54:54.450 --> 00:54:55.980 align:middle line:84%
to come together
and make dumplings.

00:54:55.980 --> 00:54:58.110 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Oh, whether it's
yams, or custard, or pork.

00:54:58.110 --> 00:55:00.000 align:middle line:84%
>>CHEN: Have you ever been part
of a dumpling-making party?

00:55:00.000 --> 00:55:01.020 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: I've never
made dumplings.

00:55:01.020 --> 00:55:02.850 align:middle line:84%
>>CHEN: You need to be part
of a dumpling-making party.

00:55:02.850 --> 00:55:03.060 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: I do.

00:55:03.060 --> 00:55:03.530 align:middle line:90%
Where do I do that?

00:55:03.530 --> 00:55:05.155 align:middle line:84%
>>CHEN: Just make
some friends like me,

00:55:05.155 --> 00:55:06.420 align:middle line:90%
and we're going to invite you.

00:55:06.420 --> 00:55:07.239 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Invite
me, because I want

00:55:07.239 --> 00:55:08.550 align:middle line:90%
to learn how to make them right.

00:55:08.550 --> 00:55:09.090 align:middle line:90%
>>CHEN: Yeah.

00:55:09.090 --> 00:55:09.660 align:middle line:90%
You come.

00:55:09.660 --> 00:55:10.698 align:middle line:90%
And we will make them.

00:55:10.698 --> 00:55:12.240 align:middle line:84%
We'll put some coins
in some of them.

00:55:12.240 --> 00:55:14.370 align:middle line:84%
If you bite into it, you're
lucky, maybe not so much

00:55:14.370 --> 00:55:14.953 align:middle line:90%
for your teeth.

00:55:14.953 --> 00:55:15.760 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: For a dentist.

00:55:15.760 --> 00:55:16.110 align:middle line:90%
>>CHEN: Yeah.

00:55:16.110 --> 00:55:17.540 align:middle line:90%
You're considered lucky.

00:55:17.540 --> 00:55:18.800 align:middle line:90%
And then you eat it.

00:55:18.800 --> 00:55:19.790 align:middle line:90%
Takes like a whole day.

00:55:19.790 --> 00:55:20.750 align:middle line:90%
It's the greatest thing ever.

00:55:20.750 --> 00:55:22.760 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: I'd love to learn
how to make dumplings.

00:55:22.760 --> 00:55:22.940 align:middle line:90%
>>CHEN: Yeah.

00:55:22.940 --> 00:55:24.980 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: I guess a lot of
our audience would be saying,

00:55:24.980 --> 00:55:26.355 align:middle line:84%
I heard him say
wheat earlier on.

00:55:26.355 --> 00:55:29.300 align:middle line:90%
Can we make them gluten free?

00:55:29.300 --> 00:55:30.100 align:middle line:90%
>>CHEN: Oh, yeah.

00:55:30.100 --> 00:55:31.280 align:middle line:90%
You know what?

00:55:31.280 --> 00:55:34.218 align:middle line:84%
I had a celery-wrapper
dumplings.

00:55:34.218 --> 00:55:35.510 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: How is that possible?

00:55:35.510 --> 00:55:36.530 align:middle line:84%
>>CHEN: Yeah, it
was kind of crazy.

00:55:36.530 --> 00:55:37.590 align:middle line:90%
But I've had it.

00:55:37.590 --> 00:55:39.740 align:middle line:84%
But it's actually
a Spanish dish.

00:55:39.740 --> 00:55:42.360 align:middle line:84%
But hey, dumplings, that's
why dumplings are great.

00:55:42.360 --> 00:55:43.160 align:middle line:90%
They're global.

00:55:43.160 --> 00:55:44.910 align:middle line:90%
Every culture has a dumpling.

00:55:44.910 --> 00:55:46.700 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Well, you're just
wrapping your food in something

00:55:46.700 --> 00:55:47.810 align:middle line:90%
else, just having a packet.

00:55:47.810 --> 00:55:48.380 align:middle line:84%
>>CHEN: Whatever
you want to call it.

00:55:48.380 --> 00:55:49.180 align:middle line:90%
Ravioli.

00:55:49.180 --> 00:55:50.060 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:55:50.060 --> 00:55:53.300 align:middle line:84%
And so whether it's
dumpling, whether it's buns,

00:55:53.300 --> 00:55:55.570 align:middle line:84%
whether it's dim sum,
this is your bailiwick.

00:55:55.570 --> 00:55:56.820 align:middle line:90%
And you know how to cook them.

00:55:56.820 --> 00:55:58.450 align:middle line:90%
>>CHEN: I know how to cook them.

00:55:58.450 --> 00:56:00.560 align:middle line:90%
Yeah, I love to cook.

00:56:00.560 --> 00:56:04.050 align:middle line:84%
My food doesn't always
turn out the prettiest,

00:56:04.050 --> 00:56:05.840 align:middle line:90%
but they will be tasty.

00:56:05.840 --> 00:56:08.233 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Tell us where
we can go in just--

00:56:08.233 --> 00:56:09.400 align:middle line:90%
OK, you're in New York City.

00:56:09.400 --> 00:56:09.620 align:middle line:90%
>>CHEN: Yes.

00:56:09.620 --> 00:56:10.220 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: OK.

00:56:10.220 --> 00:56:11.637 align:middle line:84%
And maybe some
other cities you've

00:56:11.637 --> 00:56:13.850 align:middle line:84%
been to that have really
fabulous dumplings.

00:56:13.850 --> 00:56:14.722 align:middle line:90%
>>CHEN: Yes

00:56:14.722 --> 00:56:16.430 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So where
are a couple of places

00:56:16.430 --> 00:56:18.972 align:middle line:84%
you'd give us if we're going to
take a little tour somewhere?

00:56:18.972 --> 00:56:20.638 align:middle line:84%
>>CHEN: I think New
York City definitely

00:56:20.638 --> 00:56:22.960 align:middle line:84%
has the best dumplings
outside of China for sure.

00:56:22.960 --> 00:56:23.008 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Oh, OK.

00:56:23.008 --> 00:56:24.410 align:middle line:90%
So let's get some names.

00:56:24.410 --> 00:56:25.860 align:middle line:90%
I want the names of them.

00:56:25.860 --> 00:56:26.660 align:middle line:90%
>>CHEN: Sure.

00:56:26.660 --> 00:56:29.810 align:middle line:84%
There's a great place called
Kung Fu Soup Dumplings,

00:56:29.810 --> 00:56:31.010 align:middle line:90%
which, if you nev--

00:56:31.010 --> 00:56:32.710 align:middle line:84%
have you had soup
dumplings before?

00:56:32.710 --> 00:56:33.510 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: No.

00:56:33.510 --> 00:56:34.610 align:middle line:90%
>>CHEN: You've never had?

00:56:34.610 --> 00:56:35.660 align:middle line:90%
Oh, my gosh.

00:56:35.660 --> 00:56:36.920 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: No, I can't
say that I have.

00:56:36.920 --> 00:56:37.280 align:middle line:90%
>>CHEN: Oh, Regina.

00:56:37.280 --> 00:56:38.780 align:middle line:84%
We're going have to take
a field trip after this.

00:56:38.780 --> 00:56:39.560 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Kung Fu--

00:56:39.560 --> 00:56:39.920 align:middle line:90%
>>CHEN: Ya-huh.

00:56:39.920 --> 00:56:40.350 align:middle line:90%
Soup--

00:56:40.350 --> 00:56:40.955 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Soup Dumplings.

00:56:40.955 --> 00:56:41.300 align:middle line:90%
>>CHEN: Dumplings.

00:56:41.300 --> 00:56:42.100 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: OK.

00:56:42.100 --> 00:56:44.100 align:middle line:84%
>>CHEN: They're dumplings
with soup inside.

00:56:44.100 --> 00:56:44.300 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Are you kidding?

00:56:44.300 --> 00:56:46.250 align:middle line:84%
>>CHEN: And you
drink the soup first,

00:56:46.250 --> 00:56:47.080 align:middle line:90%
and then you eat the dumpling.

00:56:47.080 --> 00:56:47.600 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: So you squeeze it.

00:56:47.600 --> 00:56:49.475 align:middle line:84%
You get the juice and
the soup in your mouth.

00:56:49.475 --> 00:56:50.560 align:middle line:90%
>>CHEN: Yeah, yeah.

00:56:50.560 --> 00:56:51.350 align:middle line:90%
And then you eat the dumpling.

00:56:51.350 --> 00:56:52.517 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: This is inventive.

00:56:52.517 --> 00:56:53.810 align:middle line:90%
>>CHEN: Right?

00:56:53.810 --> 00:56:55.710 align:middle line:90%
It's such a powerful food item.

00:56:55.710 --> 00:56:56.510 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: OK.

00:56:56.510 --> 00:56:56.970 align:middle line:90%
I love it.

00:56:56.970 --> 00:56:58.790 align:middle line:84%
Kung Fu Soup Dumpling,
New York City.

00:56:58.790 --> 00:56:59.720 align:middle line:90%
NYC.

00:56:59.720 --> 00:57:01.040 align:middle line:90%
Anything on the West Coast?

00:57:01.040 --> 00:57:02.900 align:middle line:90%
Anything in Chicago?

00:57:02.900 --> 00:57:04.400 align:middle line:84%
>>CHEN: Chicago has
a couple places.

00:57:04.400 --> 00:57:05.692 align:middle line:90%
I don't think they're the best.

00:57:05.692 --> 00:57:07.248 align:middle line:84%
I think LA has a
bunch of places.

00:57:07.248 --> 00:57:08.540 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Oh, tell us about LA.

00:57:08.540 --> 00:57:08.670 align:middle line:90%
A lot of people go there.

00:57:08.670 --> 00:57:10.410 align:middle line:90%
>>CHEN: Yeah, in 626, there is--

00:57:10.410 --> 00:57:11.210 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: 626.

00:57:11.210 --> 00:57:13.250 align:middle line:84%
>>CHEN: Yeah, there's 626, I
think there's one called Mama

00:57:13.250 --> 00:57:14.370 align:middle line:90%
Dumplings that's pretty good.

00:57:14.370 --> 00:57:14.950 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Mama.

00:57:14.950 --> 00:57:16.120 align:middle line:90%
I'm going there shortly, so.

00:57:16.120 --> 00:57:16.920 align:middle line:90%
>>CHEN: Yes.

00:57:16.920 --> 00:57:20.720 align:middle line:84%
There is there's a great
place in the Bay Area called

00:57:20.720 --> 00:57:22.077 align:middle line:90%
Ding Ding Dumplings.

00:57:22.077 --> 00:57:22.910 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Ding Ding.

00:57:22.910 --> 00:57:24.140 align:middle line:84%
>>CHEN: They have beautiful
steamed dumplings.

00:57:24.140 --> 00:57:25.307 align:middle line:10%
>>REGINA: Oh, you know what?

00:57:25.307 --> 00:57:27.952 align:middle line:84%
I was looking up dumplings
one day, just unrelated,

00:57:27.952 --> 00:57:29.660 align:middle line:84%
Ding Ding came up at
the top of the list.

00:57:29.660 --> 00:57:31.220 align:middle line:84%
>>CHEN: We all should
look up dumplings randomly

00:57:31.220 --> 00:57:32.320 align:middle line:90%
in our lives.

00:57:32.320 --> 00:57:33.120 align:middle line:90%
It's important.

00:57:33.120 --> 00:57:34.953 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Well, I was
looking up Koi Palace.

00:57:34.953 --> 00:57:37.580 align:middle line:84%
And I told you off camera that
during my PBS cooking days,

00:57:37.580 --> 00:57:39.040 align:middle line:90%
I went there with Martin Yan.

00:57:39.040 --> 00:57:40.290 align:middle line:90%
We were doing a show together.

00:57:40.290 --> 00:57:42.440 align:middle line:84%
And they rolled
out the red carpet,

00:57:42.440 --> 00:57:44.090 align:middle line:90%
I mean, as big as this--

00:57:44.090 --> 00:57:46.552 align:middle line:84%
we probably had an
assortment of dumplings

00:57:46.552 --> 00:57:47.760 align:middle line:90%
that filled this whole table.

00:57:47.760 --> 00:57:48.950 align:middle line:10%
>>CHEN: Oh, that's the
best way to eat dumplings.

00:57:48.950 --> 00:57:49.850 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: At the
Koi Palace, which

00:57:49.850 --> 00:57:51.238 align:middle line:90%
no one knows about and goes to.

00:57:51.238 --> 00:57:53.030 align:middle line:84%
And that's where I saw
Ding Ding Dumplings.

00:57:53.030 --> 00:57:55.072 align:middle line:84%
>>CHEN: If your dumpling
doesn't fill your table,

00:57:55.072 --> 00:57:56.817 align:middle line:90%
something is wrong.

00:57:56.817 --> 00:57:57.650 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: I love it.

00:57:57.650 --> 00:57:58.050 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:57:58.050 --> 00:57:59.360 align:middle line:90%
So we have a few there.

00:57:59.360 --> 00:58:01.130 align:middle line:90%
626, this is LA.

00:58:01.130 --> 00:58:02.880 align:middle line:84%
And I'm taking these
notes very seriously.

00:58:02.880 --> 00:58:03.838 align:middle line:90%
>>CHEN: Oh, you should.

00:58:03.838 --> 00:58:05.960 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: I'll be
going to these places.

00:58:05.960 --> 00:58:08.780 align:middle line:84%
So in short, what's the
big plan, the big goal?

00:58:08.780 --> 00:58:10.160 align:middle line:90%
You're popular.

00:58:10.160 --> 00:58:11.750 align:middle line:90%
I'm sure the girls love you.

00:58:11.750 --> 00:58:14.240 align:middle line:84%
And everything you wanted in
high school has come true.

00:58:14.240 --> 00:58:16.850 align:middle line:84%
You're educating people
on the mysteries of life.

00:58:16.850 --> 00:58:18.950 align:middle line:84%
You're turning them
onto good dumplings.

00:58:18.950 --> 00:58:21.020 align:middle line:90%
Your mom's alive and well.

00:58:21.020 --> 00:58:22.400 align:middle line:90%
What are you looking toward now?

00:58:22.400 --> 00:58:26.060 align:middle line:84%
>>CHEN: I think a lot of what
I need to focus a lot of time

00:58:26.060 --> 00:58:28.820 align:middle line:90%
on it right now is just myself.

00:58:28.820 --> 00:58:33.170 align:middle line:84%
Because I feel like being
busy, a lot of times

00:58:33.170 --> 00:58:34.730 align:middle line:90%
you neglect yourself.

00:58:34.730 --> 00:58:37.363 align:middle line:84%
And I think if you lose
that, I mean, that's it.

00:58:37.363 --> 00:58:38.530 align:middle line:90%
That's-- everything is gone.

00:58:38.530 --> 00:58:39.330 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:58:39.330 --> 00:58:41.270 align:middle line:84%
>>CHEN: So I'm moving,
actually, from New York

00:58:41.270 --> 00:58:42.860 align:middle line:84%
City in a couple of
months to Seattle,

00:58:42.860 --> 00:58:45.130 align:middle line:90%
just a little peace and quiet.

00:58:45.130 --> 00:58:46.380 align:middle line:90%
I love the Pacific Northwest.

00:58:46.380 --> 00:58:47.060 align:middle line:90%
I love rain.

00:58:47.060 --> 00:58:48.020 align:middle line:90%
A lot of people don't get that.

00:58:48.020 --> 00:58:48.820 align:middle line:90%
I do.

00:58:48.820 --> 00:58:50.330 align:middle line:90%
Cozy rain, some nice soup.

00:58:50.330 --> 00:58:50.930 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: I like it, too.

00:58:50.930 --> 00:58:51.390 align:middle line:90%
>>CHEN: Disney movie.

00:58:51.390 --> 00:58:53.190 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: When you're in sun
all the time in California--

00:58:53.190 --> 00:58:55.882 align:middle line:84%
I've been there, Arizona and
California, my whole life--

00:58:55.882 --> 00:58:56.840 align:middle line:90%
you like a little rain.

00:58:56.840 --> 00:58:57.820 align:middle line:90%
>>CHEN: I love rain.

00:58:57.820 --> 00:58:59.500 align:middle line:84%
And you know, like
I said, pair that up

00:58:59.500 --> 00:59:02.630 align:middle line:84%
with some nice soup and Disney
movies, it's a great afternoon.

00:59:02.630 --> 00:59:05.180 align:middle line:84%
And then I'll be going to
Japan and exploring a lot more,

00:59:05.180 --> 00:59:08.030 align:middle line:84%
I feel like, for myself,
my own spirituality,

00:59:08.030 --> 00:59:10.430 align:middle line:90%
get myself more grounded.

00:59:10.430 --> 00:59:14.030 align:middle line:84%
I think that's the
most important thing.

00:59:14.030 --> 00:59:17.100 align:middle line:84%
I don't see myself as
a popular anything.

00:59:17.100 --> 00:59:17.900 align:middle line:90%
I just see myself--

00:59:17.900 --> 00:59:18.830 align:middle line:84%
I'm doing what I'm
passionate about.

00:59:18.830 --> 00:59:19.910 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: You're just doing
what you love right now.

00:59:19.910 --> 00:59:20.210 align:middle line:90%
>>CHEN: Yeah.

00:59:20.210 --> 00:59:22.370 align:middle line:84%
And then I'm fortunate
enough that people

00:59:22.370 --> 00:59:24.240 align:middle line:90%
follow me and watch what I do.

00:59:24.240 --> 00:59:26.805 align:middle line:90%
And I'm so happy for that.

00:59:26.805 --> 00:59:29.180 align:middle line:84%
But I want to present, always,
the best version of myself

00:59:29.180 --> 00:59:29.980 align:middle line:90%
to everybody.

00:59:29.980 --> 00:59:32.240 align:middle line:84%
Because if I lose that,
then that's everything.

00:59:32.240 --> 00:59:33.900 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So you're going to
take a little inside time.

00:59:33.900 --> 00:59:34.370 align:middle line:90%
>>CHEN: Take some time.

00:59:34.370 --> 00:59:34.730 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Because
you said you've

00:59:34.730 --> 00:59:36.380 align:middle line:84%
been to how many
countries in the last year

00:59:36.380 --> 00:59:37.880 align:middle line:84%
traveling eight
months of last year?

00:59:37.880 --> 00:59:41.070 align:middle line:84%
>>CHEN: Last year, I was
in about 15 countries.

00:59:41.070 --> 00:59:41.870 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:59:41.870 --> 00:59:43.328 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Eight
months on the road.

00:59:43.328 --> 00:59:45.560 align:middle line:84%
>>CHEN: Yeah eight months
on the road, solid.

00:59:45.560 --> 00:59:46.440 align:middle line:90%
It's just insane.

00:59:46.440 --> 00:59:49.300 align:middle line:90%
I looked at my hotel stay thing.

00:59:49.300 --> 00:59:50.100 align:middle line:90%
I was like what?

00:59:50.100 --> 00:59:52.904 align:middle line:90%
I stayed here for that long?

00:59:52.904 --> 00:59:53.880 align:middle line:90%
Seriously?

00:59:53.880 --> 00:59:54.680 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: OK.

00:59:54.680 --> 00:59:57.890 align:middle line:84%
So you're going to pull it in,
get everything, get your forces

00:59:57.890 --> 00:59:59.240 align:middle line:90%
built up even more this year.

00:59:59.240 --> 00:59:59.520 align:middle line:90%
>>CHEN: Yeah.

00:59:59.520 --> 01:00:01.700 align:middle line:84%
And then I'm launching a
cooking course, because I love--

01:00:01.700 --> 01:00:02.380 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: You are?

01:00:02.380 --> 01:00:03.230 align:middle line:84%
>>CHEN: I am launching
a cooking course.

01:00:03.230 --> 01:00:04.100 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Is it
going to be online?

01:00:04.100 --> 01:00:04.880 align:middle line:90%
>>CHEN: It's going to be online.

01:00:04.880 --> 01:00:06.297 align:middle line:84%
It's going to be
really fantastic,

01:00:06.297 --> 01:00:08.807 align:middle line:84%
some great recipes,
teach you how to cook,

01:00:08.807 --> 01:00:10.640 align:middle line:84%
explain a little more
about Chinese cooking,

01:00:10.640 --> 01:00:12.260 align:middle line:90%
which is my passion.

01:00:12.260 --> 01:00:13.920 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Oh, when
does this happen?

01:00:13.920 --> 01:00:16.740 align:middle line:84%
>>CHEN: I think it's
coming out in a few months.

01:00:16.740 --> 01:00:17.770 align:middle line:90%
It's coming out.

01:00:17.770 --> 01:00:20.020 align:middle line:84%
It's already done filming,
just waiting for the edit.

01:00:20.020 --> 01:00:21.070 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

01:00:21.070 --> 01:00:24.310 align:middle line:84%
Are you doing a companion thing
with any of the TV stations,

01:00:24.310 --> 01:00:26.500 align:middle line:84%
"PBS," or a Cooking
Channel, or just all online?

01:00:26.500 --> 01:00:27.300 align:middle line:90%
>>CHEN: No.

01:00:27.300 --> 01:00:28.330 align:middle line:90%
This is just all me.

01:00:28.330 --> 01:00:28.520 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Good.

01:00:28.520 --> 01:00:28.900 align:middle line:90%
Good.

01:00:28.900 --> 01:00:30.110 align:middle line:90%
>>CHEN: No one's directing me.

01:00:30.110 --> 01:00:30.943 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: I love it.

01:00:30.943 --> 01:00:32.100 align:middle line:90%
Even better.

01:00:32.100 --> 01:00:32.410 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

01:00:32.410 --> 01:00:34.243 align:middle line:84%
That's what-- on my
show, that's what I did.

01:00:34.243 --> 01:00:35.710 align:middle line:90%
I got to do what I wanted.

01:00:35.710 --> 01:00:39.790 align:middle line:84%
I was my producer, and it's
so much fun doing it that way.

01:00:39.790 --> 01:00:41.020 align:middle line:90%
And you'll have dumplings.

01:00:41.020 --> 01:00:41.820 align:middle line:90%
>>CHEN: Oh.

01:00:41.820 --> 01:00:42.660 align:middle line:90%
Oh.

01:00:42.660 --> 01:00:45.090 align:middle line:84%
Best dumpling recipe
is in that course.

01:00:45.090 --> 01:00:47.590 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: I like that custardy
dumpling, that little dessert

01:00:47.590 --> 01:00:48.435 align:middle line:90%
dumpling, too.

01:00:48.435 --> 01:00:49.235 align:middle line:90%
I love that one.

01:00:49.235 --> 01:00:49.340 align:middle line:90%
>>CHEN: OK.

01:00:49.340 --> 01:00:51.520 align:middle line:10%
We're going to have to
go-- like, come to New York

01:00:51.520 --> 01:00:53.770 align:middle line:10%
before I leave and let me take
you on a little food tour.

01:00:53.770 --> 01:00:54.350 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: I would love that.

01:00:54.350 --> 01:00:55.110 align:middle line:90%
>>CHEN: It's going to be insane.

01:00:55.110 --> 01:00:55.520 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: OK.

01:00:55.520 --> 01:00:56.695 align:middle line:90%
I'm going to do it.

01:00:56.695 --> 01:00:57.697 align:middle line:90%
Oh, love you to pieces.

01:00:57.697 --> 01:00:58.905 align:middle line:90%
You're just doing great work.

01:00:58.905 --> 01:01:00.238 align:middle line:90%
>>CHEN: Well, thank you so much.

01:01:00.238 --> 01:01:01.780 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: To see
more of Mike's work,

01:01:01.780 --> 01:01:03.310 align:middle line:84%

Science" on YouTube

You're going to love them.

01:01:08.560 --> 01:01:10.477 align:middle line:10%
