00:00:08.742 --> 00:00:10.950 align:middle line:84%
>> SARAH GRACE: I didn't
understand what I was seeing

00:00:10.950 --> 00:00:11.750 align:middle line:90%
as a kid.

00:00:11.750 --> 00:00:15.090 align:middle line:84%
All I would know is that
my mom would be somewhat OK

00:00:15.090 --> 00:00:16.170 align:middle line:90%
and then get triggered.

00:00:16.170 --> 00:00:17.970 align:middle line:84%
And in the violent
rage outburst,

00:00:17.970 --> 00:00:20.580 align:middle line:84%
the individual that soul
essence that I could sort of

00:00:20.580 --> 00:00:23.070 align:middle line:90%
feel as a mother would be gone.

00:00:23.070 --> 00:00:25.230 align:middle line:84%
I was having a
day, and I got mad.

00:00:25.230 --> 00:00:27.780 align:middle line:84%
So I picked up some rocks,
and I threw it at her.

00:00:27.780 --> 00:00:29.610 align:middle line:90%
And I roll over, and I look.

00:00:29.610 --> 00:00:32.480 align:middle line:84%
And there's this chief with
a full headdress sitting

00:00:32.480 --> 00:00:33.280 align:middle line:90%
on a horse.

00:00:33.280 --> 00:00:35.430 align:middle line:84%
And all of a sudden, I
felt really like a schlep.

00:00:35.430 --> 00:00:38.700 align:middle line:84%
After my overdose, I went
through the UCLA EMT course.

00:00:38.700 --> 00:00:41.760 align:middle line:84%
And I got sent straight down
into South Central Los Angeles.

00:00:41.760 --> 00:00:45.270 align:middle line:84%
Yes, he turned all the way
around to where I was sitting.

00:00:45.270 --> 00:00:46.860 align:middle line:84%
And he looked me
directly in the eyes

00:00:46.860 --> 00:00:50.040 align:middle line:84%
and said, I'm going to
die today, aren't I?

00:00:50.040 --> 00:00:52.658 align:middle line:84%
There's as many ways to
die as there are to live.

00:00:52.658 --> 00:00:53.700 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA MEREDITH: Yeah.

00:00:53.700 --> 00:00:56.070 align:middle line:84%
>> GRACE: And there's
nothing to fear.

00:00:56.070 --> 00:00:57.930 align:middle line:84%
It's like taking
off a heavy coat.

00:00:57.930 --> 00:01:00.780 align:middle line:84%
Those of us that are
sensitive, it's our time.

00:01:00.780 --> 00:01:03.450 align:middle line:84%
We are being called
online for a purpose.

00:01:03.450 --> 00:01:07.530 align:middle line:84%
Like all of this stuff that I've
been through makes sense now.

00:01:07.530 --> 00:01:10.505 align:middle line:90%


00:01:10.505 --> 00:01:12.630 align:middle line:10%
>> REGINA: Imagine a world
in which you were seeing

00:01:12.630 --> 00:01:15.750 align:middle line:10%
a constant show of
lights, moving forms,

00:01:15.750 --> 00:01:18.330 align:middle line:10%
and hearing voices from
other dimensions crying out

00:01:18.330 --> 00:01:19.680 align:middle line:10%
for your attention.

00:01:19.680 --> 00:01:22.080 align:middle line:84%
Demons to angels, the
noise never stopped.

00:01:22.080 --> 00:01:23.790 align:middle line:84%
This was the world
of Sarah Grace

00:01:23.790 --> 00:01:25.230 align:middle line:90%
as she grew up in the world.

00:01:25.230 --> 00:01:27.720 align:middle line:84%
After a very difficult
start, she found her way

00:01:27.720 --> 00:01:31.170 align:middle line:84%
to managing and ultimately
using these abilities

00:01:31.170 --> 00:01:32.590 align:middle line:90%
to help others heal.

00:01:32.590 --> 00:01:33.390 align:middle line:90%
Welcome.

00:01:33.390 --> 00:01:34.320 align:middle line:90%
It's good to see you.

00:01:34.320 --> 00:01:34.890 align:middle line:90%
>> GRACE: Hi, Regina.

00:01:34.890 --> 00:01:35.940 align:middle line:90%
Thank you for having me.

00:01:35.940 --> 00:01:37.600 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: Found out we're
practically neighbors.

00:01:37.600 --> 00:01:38.520 align:middle line:90%
>> GRACE: Practically so.

00:01:38.520 --> 00:01:40.030 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: We both live
in the Sierra Foothills.

00:01:40.030 --> 00:01:40.540 align:middle line:90%
>> GRACE: Yes, beautiful area.

00:01:40.540 --> 00:01:41.340 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Yes.

00:01:41.340 --> 00:01:43.650 align:middle line:84%
It is a beautiful
area, and you needed

00:01:43.650 --> 00:01:46.650 align:middle line:84%
that to find some peace
after the life you had lived.

00:01:46.650 --> 00:01:48.750 align:middle line:84%
>> GRACE: Yes, it's
been quite a ride.

00:01:48.750 --> 00:01:49.740 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Oh my gosh.

00:01:49.740 --> 00:01:52.560 align:middle line:10%
So anyway, first
of all, you were--

00:01:52.560 --> 00:01:54.150 align:middle line:10%
I think what was
so intriguing to me

00:01:54.150 --> 00:01:57.150 align:middle line:10%
about your book and this
story is that we often

00:01:57.150 --> 00:02:00.990 align:middle line:10%
try to imagine what happens
when we're just jettisoned

00:02:00.990 --> 00:02:05.130 align:middle line:10%
from our body in something
quick and tragic versus what

00:02:05.130 --> 00:02:08.669 align:middle line:10%
happens when someone is
passing away in a hospital

00:02:08.669 --> 00:02:11.550 align:middle line:10%
after complications, and
everyone kind of knows what's

00:02:11.550 --> 00:02:13.190 align:middle line:10%
going on, and there's
some preparation.

00:02:13.190 --> 00:02:17.160 align:middle line:84%
And so these stories of
what you saw as a paramedic

00:02:17.160 --> 00:02:20.250 align:middle line:84%
are the ones that are
not told as a rule.

00:02:20.250 --> 00:02:22.487 align:middle line:84%
And so before we
go into your life,

00:02:22.487 --> 00:02:24.070 align:middle line:84%
let's start where
it started from you.

00:02:24.070 --> 00:02:29.160 align:middle line:84%
And in the book, its
seeming randomness of life,

00:02:29.160 --> 00:02:32.250 align:middle line:84%
a young woman named
Taylor who was basically

00:02:32.250 --> 00:02:34.800 align:middle line:84%
clocked by a Hummer
in her little civic

00:02:34.800 --> 00:02:37.920 align:middle line:84%
and where she was on her way
to, what was to have happened,

00:02:37.920 --> 00:02:40.145 align:middle line:90%
and what your experience was.

00:02:40.145 --> 00:02:41.020 align:middle line:90%
>> GRACE: Oh my gosh.

00:02:41.020 --> 00:02:42.930 align:middle line:84%
I remember this
call like yesterday.

00:02:42.930 --> 00:02:45.390 align:middle line:10%
So we're talking about
me being a paramedic,

00:02:45.390 --> 00:02:48.990 align:middle line:10%
working as a paramedic in
the California 911 system,

00:02:48.990 --> 00:02:52.180 align:middle line:10%
and being able to use my psychic
abilities in those emergency

00:02:52.180 --> 00:02:52.980 align:middle line:10%
settings.

00:02:52.980 --> 00:02:55.620 align:middle line:10%
And so Taylor was just
a young beautiful girl

00:02:55.620 --> 00:02:58.080 align:middle line:10%
driving her car one evening.

00:02:58.080 --> 00:03:00.450 align:middle line:84%
And she made a
left-hand turn and got

00:03:00.450 --> 00:03:03.960 align:middle line:84%
hit by a drunk driver in a
Hum-- it was a big Humvee.

00:03:03.960 --> 00:03:08.790 align:middle line:84%
And she was trapped and
pinned in her Honda Civic,

00:03:08.790 --> 00:03:12.150 align:middle line:84%
but her head was kind of
shot into the back side.

00:03:12.150 --> 00:03:14.572 align:middle line:84%
And we were having
to extricate--

00:03:14.572 --> 00:03:15.405 align:middle line:90%
having to navigate--

00:03:15.405 --> 00:03:15.660 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Cut her out?

00:03:15.660 --> 00:03:16.950 align:middle line:84%
>> GRACE: --or cut
her out of the car.

00:03:16.950 --> 00:03:18.660 align:middle line:84%
And there's a lot
that has to happen

00:03:18.660 --> 00:03:20.260 align:middle line:90%
when we're dealing with that.

00:03:20.260 --> 00:03:22.320 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: And was she
still alive at the time--

00:03:22.320 --> 00:03:22.650 align:middle line:90%
>> GRACE: She was.

00:03:22.650 --> 00:03:23.130 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: --when you started.

00:03:23.130 --> 00:03:25.080 align:middle line:84%
>> GRACE: I could see
the agonal respirations,

00:03:25.080 --> 00:03:26.790 align:middle line:84%
which looks like
guppy breathing,

00:03:26.790 --> 00:03:28.457 align:middle line:90%
is kind of the final gasps.

00:03:28.457 --> 00:03:30.540 align:middle line:84%
And there was a lot of
blood coming from her head.

00:03:30.540 --> 00:03:33.097 align:middle line:84%
So her femurs and legs
were trapped and pinned

00:03:33.097 --> 00:03:34.680 align:middle line:84%
under the steering
wheel, and her head

00:03:34.680 --> 00:03:36.370 align:middle line:84%
was in the back
seat passenger side.

00:03:36.370 --> 00:03:38.280 align:middle line:84%
So her body had
kind of contorted.

00:03:38.280 --> 00:03:41.520 align:middle line:84%
And so I knew that I was going
to need to access her airway

00:03:41.520 --> 00:03:44.400 align:middle line:84%
and try to help her
breathe as we're

00:03:44.400 --> 00:03:45.940 align:middle line:90%
cutting her out of the vehicle.

00:03:45.940 --> 00:03:49.590 align:middle line:84%
And as I was doing that,
I began to notice--

00:03:49.590 --> 00:03:52.410 align:middle line:84%
so you have to understand, this
is such a high-velocity scene

00:03:52.410 --> 00:03:52.755 align:middle line:90%
anyway.

00:03:52.755 --> 00:03:53.100 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Oh, yeah.

00:03:53.100 --> 00:03:53.900 align:middle line:90%
>> GRACE: Right?

00:03:53.900 --> 00:03:56.190 align:middle line:84%
Because any time we
have Jaws of Life,

00:03:56.190 --> 00:03:58.883 align:middle line:84%
there's a lot of personnel on
scene, this is a really high--

00:03:58.883 --> 00:03:59.800 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Adrenaline?

00:03:59.800 --> 00:04:00.600 align:middle line:90%
>> GRACE: Yeah.

00:04:00.600 --> 00:04:02.490 align:middle line:90%
High-octane call for sure.

00:04:02.490 --> 00:04:06.298 align:middle line:84%
And then it's such
a young female.

00:04:06.298 --> 00:04:07.965 align:middle line:84%
And then we're also
dealing with the DUI

00:04:07.965 --> 00:04:09.550 align:middle line:84%
hitting the driver
guy over there.

00:04:09.550 --> 00:04:11.940 align:middle line:84%
And so there's a lot of
facets to the scene going on.

00:04:11.940 --> 00:04:13.950 align:middle line:84%
And from a high-sense
perception,

00:04:13.950 --> 00:04:16.570 align:middle line:84%
I'm aware of all of
them simultaneously,

00:04:16.570 --> 00:04:18.140 align:middle line:90%
which is a lot to manage.

00:04:18.140 --> 00:04:18.940 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: It is.

00:04:18.940 --> 00:04:21.209 align:middle line:84%
>> GRACE: But in
that, I noticed--

00:04:21.209 --> 00:04:26.110 align:middle line:84%
it starts like fireflies,
very, very beautiful to see.

00:04:26.110 --> 00:04:28.740 align:middle line:84%
And a celestial
angel came on scene

00:04:28.740 --> 00:04:32.910 align:middle line:84%
and just blanketed the
entire scene with this calm,

00:04:32.910 --> 00:04:38.430 align:middle line:84%
nurturing, very almost like
silent reverent presence.

00:04:38.430 --> 00:04:41.670 align:middle line:84%
And Taylor, so Taylor's
body was in the car,

00:04:41.670 --> 00:04:43.770 align:middle line:84%
but her soul had
been hovering above.

00:04:43.770 --> 00:04:46.770 align:middle line:84%
And in my clairvoyant
vision, I could see her soul.

00:04:46.770 --> 00:04:48.180 align:middle line:90%
And she was confused.

00:04:48.180 --> 00:04:50.010 align:middle line:84%
She didn't understand
what was going on

00:04:50.010 --> 00:04:53.640 align:middle line:84%
because just a second ago, she
was making a left-hand turn.

00:04:53.640 --> 00:04:58.140 align:middle line:84%
And so using my clairvoyance
and telepathic ability,

00:04:58.140 --> 00:05:00.617 align:middle line:84%
I started communicating
with her like,

00:05:00.617 --> 00:05:01.950 align:middle line:90%
you were just in a car accident.

00:05:01.950 --> 00:05:02.520 align:middle line:90%
You're dead.

00:05:02.520 --> 00:05:03.700 align:middle line:90%
We're working on your body.

00:05:03.700 --> 00:05:04.920 align:middle line:90%
This is what's happening.

00:05:04.920 --> 00:05:07.380 align:middle line:84%
And then the angel
came on scene,

00:05:07.380 --> 00:05:09.630 align:middle line:84%
and then she started
to look at the angel.

00:05:09.630 --> 00:05:13.170 align:middle line:84%
And ever so slowly, her soul
became one with the celestial.

00:05:13.170 --> 00:05:16.080 align:middle line:84%
And they disappeared from
my view at which time

00:05:16.080 --> 00:05:21.590 align:middle line:84%
we lost pulses completely, and
she departed from her body.

00:05:21.590 --> 00:05:24.320 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: And she was on
her way to see her boyfriend.

00:05:24.320 --> 00:05:26.580 align:middle line:84%
And her boyfriend was
getting ready to propose

00:05:26.580 --> 00:05:27.380 align:middle line:90%
to her as I recall.

00:05:27.380 --> 00:05:29.870 align:middle line:84%
>> GRACE: I found that out
at the hospital after we

00:05:29.870 --> 00:05:32.903 align:middle line:84%
transported because,
you know, wanted to--

00:05:32.903 --> 00:05:34.070 align:middle line:90%
I knew that she had crossed.

00:05:34.070 --> 00:05:35.630 align:middle line:90%
I knew that she was gone.

00:05:35.630 --> 00:05:38.540 align:middle line:84%
But we have protocols
to run as a paramedic,

00:05:38.540 --> 00:05:41.660 align:middle line:84%
and we wanted to do
everything possible for her.

00:05:41.660 --> 00:05:43.400 align:middle line:84%
And we brought her
into the hospital,

00:05:43.400 --> 00:05:46.700 align:middle line:84%
and one of the police
officers on scene had come in

00:05:46.700 --> 00:05:47.500 align:middle line:90%
and told us that.

00:05:47.500 --> 00:05:49.000 align:middle line:84%
He had just talked
to the boyfriend.

00:05:49.000 --> 00:05:51.890 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: And it does make it
all seem so random, and yet--

00:05:51.890 --> 00:05:54.650 align:middle line:84%
I did an interview with Lee
Harris and the group of Zs

00:05:54.650 --> 00:05:57.320 align:middle line:84%
the other day, and you've
mentioned this as well.

00:05:57.320 --> 00:06:00.420 align:middle line:84%
You've come to learn that
we have many exit points.

00:06:00.420 --> 00:06:01.220 align:middle line:90%
>> GRACE: Yeah.

00:06:01.220 --> 00:06:01.970 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: There are
many opportunities.

00:06:01.970 --> 00:06:02.900 align:middle line:90%
>> GRACE: Many.

00:06:02.900 --> 00:06:04.775 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: But I look
at something like that,

00:06:04.775 --> 00:06:08.780 align:middle line:84%
and I think, where was
the sense in that one?

00:06:08.780 --> 00:06:12.530 align:middle line:84%
>> GRACE: I think that each
soul's incarnation has so many

00:06:12.530 --> 00:06:16.340 align:middle line:84%
layers of karmic and ancestral,
and there's so many different

00:06:16.340 --> 00:06:18.740 align:middle line:84%
levels to it that it might
not make sense to our level

00:06:18.740 --> 00:06:18.800 align:middle line:90%
of mind.

00:06:18.800 --> 00:06:19.910 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: It may
not be obvious.

00:06:19.910 --> 00:06:20.082 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:06:20.082 --> 00:06:20.882 align:middle line:90%
>> GRACE: Yeah.

00:06:20.882 --> 00:06:23.840 align:middle line:84%
But there's an organized rhythm
to the chaos of the universe,

00:06:23.840 --> 00:06:24.640 align:middle line:90%
I found.

00:06:24.640 --> 00:06:27.057 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: It might be if she'd
gone on to marry this man,

00:06:27.057 --> 00:06:29.720 align:middle line:84%
something entirely different, a
different trajectory would have

00:06:29.720 --> 00:06:32.600 align:middle line:84%
happened that maybe her soul
didn't want to experience after

00:06:32.600 --> 00:06:33.400 align:middle line:90%
all.

00:06:33.400 --> 00:06:34.670 align:middle line:90%
I mean, you're right.

00:06:34.670 --> 00:06:35.820 align:middle line:90%
We just don't know.

00:06:35.820 --> 00:06:38.330 align:middle line:84%
But watching this whole
scene, because you were fairly

00:06:38.330 --> 00:06:39.763 align:middle line:90%
new to the job as I recall--

00:06:39.763 --> 00:06:41.180 align:middle line:84%
>> GRACE: I wasn't
new to the job,

00:06:41.180 --> 00:06:43.140 align:middle line:84%
but I was not open
to my abilities.

00:06:43.140 --> 00:06:45.890 align:middle line:84%
I was still heavily
closeted about my abilities,

00:06:45.890 --> 00:06:47.520 align:middle line:90%
so I had a lot of fear.

00:06:47.520 --> 00:06:51.680 align:middle line:84%
And it was so much for my mind
to be like, it's one thing just

00:06:51.680 --> 00:06:53.960 align:middle line:90%
to do CPR on a person.

00:06:53.960 --> 00:06:55.500 align:middle line:84%
Just to watch
somebody die is a lot.

00:06:55.500 --> 00:06:56.300 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Yeah.

00:06:56.300 --> 00:06:58.130 align:middle line:84%
>> GRACE: And then to
watch somebody die,

00:06:58.130 --> 00:07:01.340 align:middle line:84%
high-octane and be able to
see their soul and watch

00:07:01.340 --> 00:07:04.140 align:middle line:84%
their confusion and
watch their, you know,

00:07:04.140 --> 00:07:07.880 align:middle line:84%
whatever their experience
is and then ultimately

00:07:07.880 --> 00:07:10.265 align:middle line:84%
their transition, it's
like, where do you put that?

00:07:10.265 --> 00:07:12.140 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: Well, that's
what I was wondering.

00:07:12.140 --> 00:07:14.750 align:middle line:84%
So that's when you began
opening the abilities blended

00:07:14.750 --> 00:07:16.470 align:middle line:90%
with your paramedic skills.

00:07:16.470 --> 00:07:18.320 align:middle line:90%
How did that shift you?

00:07:18.320 --> 00:07:20.240 align:middle line:84%
That first experience,
what did that

00:07:20.240 --> 00:07:22.910 align:middle line:84%
do for your understanding
of your place,

00:07:22.910 --> 00:07:25.437 align:middle line:84%
really, in the
world in doing this?

00:07:25.437 --> 00:07:27.270 align:middle line:84%
>> GRACE: Well, I've
been able to see, hear,

00:07:27.270 --> 00:07:29.570 align:middle line:84%
and feel energy outside of
the normal senses since I was

00:07:29.570 --> 00:07:30.170 align:middle line:90%
a kid.

00:07:30.170 --> 00:07:30.410 align:middle line:90%
Right?

00:07:30.410 --> 00:07:31.440 align:middle line:90%
We'll talk about that.

00:07:31.440 --> 00:07:33.020 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: We're going
to get in just a moment.

00:07:33.020 --> 00:07:34.145 align:middle line:90%
>> GRACE: Yeah, no problem.

00:07:34.145 --> 00:07:37.610 align:middle line:90%
But I wasn't comfortable.

00:07:37.610 --> 00:07:39.800 align:middle line:84%
I wasn't open with
it, and I wasn't

00:07:39.800 --> 00:07:42.330 align:middle line:90%
educated on how to navigate it.

00:07:42.330 --> 00:07:45.450 align:middle line:90%
And so it was a lot.

00:07:45.450 --> 00:07:47.990 align:middle line:84%
It was really, really
hard for the first number

00:07:47.990 --> 00:07:49.130 align:middle line:90%
of years as a paramedic.

00:07:49.130 --> 00:07:54.500 align:middle line:84%
I mean, it just
happened, the energies

00:07:54.500 --> 00:07:55.730 align:middle line:90%
became like a symphony.

00:07:55.730 --> 00:07:57.450 align:middle line:84%
And I could watch
what was happening,

00:07:57.450 --> 00:07:59.158 align:middle line:84%
and I would know what
was going to happen

00:07:59.158 --> 00:08:01.890 align:middle line:84%
two or three paces ahead, which
actually came in handy on a 911

00:08:01.890 --> 00:08:02.690 align:middle line:90%
call.

00:08:02.690 --> 00:08:03.440 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Oh yeah.

00:08:03.440 --> 00:08:03.860 align:middle line:90%
Oh yeah.

00:08:03.860 --> 00:08:05.402 align:middle line:84%
>> GRACE: But not
having the footing,

00:08:05.402 --> 00:08:08.208 align:middle line:84%
not having the understanding,
it was really hard on me.

00:08:08.208 --> 00:08:10.250 align:middle line:84%
It was just a person who
was just trying to live.

00:08:10.250 --> 00:08:11.330 align:middle line:90%
It's like, I have kids.

00:08:11.330 --> 00:08:13.160 align:middle line:84%
You got to go home make
dinner and put them to bed

00:08:13.160 --> 00:08:14.150 align:middle line:90%
after something like that?

00:08:14.150 --> 00:08:16.310 align:middle line:84%
You're like, what do I, you
know, how do I deal with this?

00:08:16.310 --> 00:08:18.446 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: After you've
watched something so profound.

00:08:18.446 --> 00:08:19.246 align:middle line:90%
>> GRACE: Mm-hmm.

00:08:19.246 --> 00:08:21.960 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: So now let's
go back to you as a kid.

00:08:21.960 --> 00:08:22.760 align:middle line:90%
>> GRACE: Mm-hmm.

00:08:22.760 --> 00:08:25.340 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: My heart
hurt reading your book.

00:08:25.340 --> 00:08:27.420 align:middle line:84%
You had a very
rough start to life.

00:08:27.420 --> 00:08:28.220 align:middle line:90%
>> GRACE: Indeed.

00:08:28.220 --> 00:08:33.049 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: And your
parenting was not the best.

00:08:33.049 --> 00:08:34.640 align:middle line:90%
I think it's fair to say.

00:08:34.640 --> 00:08:36.960 align:middle line:84%
So let's talk a little
bit about, first of all,

00:08:36.960 --> 00:08:39.530 align:middle line:84%
you were a young girl,
and you were seeing--

00:08:39.530 --> 00:08:41.030 align:middle line:84%
not just seeing and
hearing, but you

00:08:41.030 --> 00:08:43.580 align:middle line:84%
were feeling everything
and other people's emotions

00:08:43.580 --> 00:08:46.400 align:middle line:84%
on top of this circus
of energy and beings

00:08:46.400 --> 00:08:47.400 align:middle line:90%
that you were seeing.

00:08:47.400 --> 00:08:50.330 align:middle line:84%
So let's talk about how that
move came forward in your life

00:08:50.330 --> 00:08:54.200 align:middle line:84%
when you were young and how
did you share that with others

00:08:54.200 --> 00:08:56.090 align:middle line:90%
and how they perceived it.

00:08:56.090 --> 00:08:57.960 align:middle line:84%
>> GRACE: So my
abilities for me--

00:08:57.960 --> 00:08:59.990 align:middle line:84%
well, first of all, I
grew up in South Dakota

00:08:59.990 --> 00:09:03.230 align:middle line:84%
in the middle of
nowhere, pre-internet.

00:09:03.230 --> 00:09:05.450 align:middle line:84%
So there was no just like
hopping on the computer

00:09:05.450 --> 00:09:07.270 align:middle line:84%
and googling, why do
I see dead people?

00:09:07.270 --> 00:09:09.770 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: And church is kind
of the center of the locality.

00:09:09.770 --> 00:09:10.570 align:middle line:90%
>> GRACE: Yeah.

00:09:10.570 --> 00:09:13.650 align:middle line:84%
Oh, very, very conservative
area where I was.

00:09:13.650 --> 00:09:16.185 align:middle line:84%
And so I was just
a normal kid, you

00:09:16.185 --> 00:09:17.810 align:middle line:84%
know, cruising around
on my little bike

00:09:17.810 --> 00:09:19.040 align:middle line:90%
and doing my little thing.

00:09:19.040 --> 00:09:21.860 align:middle line:84%
And one day, I just woke up,
and the first thing for me

00:09:21.860 --> 00:09:22.970 align:middle line:90%
was auric fields.

00:09:22.970 --> 00:09:27.830 align:middle line:84%
So I started to see color around
people and around, you know,

00:09:27.830 --> 00:09:30.890 align:middle line:84%
I can see auric fields
around everything-- trees

00:09:30.890 --> 00:09:32.660 align:middle line:84%
and plants and
animals and whatever,

00:09:32.660 --> 00:09:34.140 align:middle line:90%
but predominantly people.

00:09:34.140 --> 00:09:36.050 align:middle line:90%
And so I just was like, oh, OK.

00:09:36.050 --> 00:09:37.340 align:middle line:90%
Well, there's that.

00:09:37.340 --> 00:09:39.720 align:middle line:84%
But I was just going to
keep doing my little thing.

00:09:39.720 --> 00:09:44.090 align:middle line:84%
So my experience was
it increased over time.

00:09:44.090 --> 00:09:47.720 align:middle line:84%
Two weeks to two months
probably in full duration for it

00:09:47.720 --> 00:09:50.540 align:middle line:84%
to fully come on for
me, but it started

00:09:50.540 --> 00:09:52.730 align:middle line:84%
with clairvoyance
and auric fields.

00:09:52.730 --> 00:09:55.640 align:middle line:84%
And then it went into kind
of this expanded state

00:09:55.640 --> 00:10:00.410 align:middle line:84%
and, like, sensing ley lines
and energy of the Earth plane.

00:10:00.410 --> 00:10:03.710 align:middle line:84%
And then I could feel
everybody's emotions,

00:10:03.710 --> 00:10:05.490 align:middle line:84%
and I could feel
their intentions.

00:10:05.490 --> 00:10:08.997 align:middle line:84%
And as a 7-year-old,
that's startling, right?

00:10:08.997 --> 00:10:09.830 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Oh, yeah.

00:10:09.830 --> 00:10:12.320 align:middle line:84%
>> GRACE: And then I could
start to see disease in blocks

00:10:12.320 --> 00:10:15.488 align:middle line:84%
and different energy
blocks in people's bodies.

00:10:15.488 --> 00:10:17.030 align:middle line:84%
And then I could
hear their thoughts.

00:10:17.030 --> 00:10:18.410 align:middle line:84%
And then it
progressed ultimately

00:10:18.410 --> 00:10:22.550 align:middle line:84%
to seeing dead
people and spirits,

00:10:22.550 --> 00:10:25.070 align:middle line:84%
a lot of-- because I was
right around the Standing Rock

00:10:25.070 --> 00:10:28.430 align:middle line:84%
Reservation, so a lot
of Native spirits.

00:10:28.430 --> 00:10:31.020 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: And that will come
back into play in a minute.

00:10:31.020 --> 00:10:34.550 align:middle line:84%
But let's go to your mom
because she was really

00:10:34.550 --> 00:10:36.140 align:middle line:84%
a profound influence
on your life.

00:10:36.140 --> 00:10:39.110 align:middle line:84%
And people will listen to this
and say, but why would you

00:10:39.110 --> 00:10:41.060 align:middle line:90%
have to choose that experience?

00:10:41.060 --> 00:10:43.550 align:middle line:84%
But I have to say, I've
interviewed a lot of people,

00:10:43.550 --> 00:10:48.260 align:middle line:84%
and it is not unusual to have
a really tough kind of road

00:10:48.260 --> 00:10:51.020 align:middle line:84%
with the parents as these
abilities are coming online.

00:10:51.020 --> 00:10:53.300 align:middle line:84%
And you'll be able to pull
it together for us later.

00:10:53.300 --> 00:10:56.330 align:middle line:84%
Tell us about your mom
because she had really violent

00:10:56.330 --> 00:10:57.620 align:middle line:90%
psychotic episodes.

00:10:57.620 --> 00:11:01.460 align:middle line:84%
>> GRACE: Yeah, a very
very wounded soul,

00:11:01.460 --> 00:11:02.915 align:middle line:90%
my greatest teacher.

00:11:02.915 --> 00:11:07.760 align:middle line:84%
I personally believe that the
people that teach us the most

00:11:07.760 --> 00:11:11.060 align:middle line:84%
severe lessons can be
our greatest teachers,

00:11:11.060 --> 00:11:12.980 align:middle line:84%
and she was definitely
that for me.

00:11:12.980 --> 00:11:18.830 align:middle line:84%
So unstable, mentally unstable,
energetically unstable,

00:11:18.830 --> 00:11:23.030 align:middle line:84%
emotionally unstable,
very wounded, and she

00:11:23.030 --> 00:11:26.307 align:middle line:84%
would swing so there
would be a nice side.

00:11:26.307 --> 00:11:27.140 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Nice mom?

00:11:27.140 --> 00:11:27.940 align:middle line:90%
>> GRACE: Yeah.

00:11:27.940 --> 00:11:32.060 align:middle line:84%
And then there would be the
really behind the closed doors

00:11:32.060 --> 00:11:33.290 align:middle line:90%
at home mom.

00:11:33.290 --> 00:11:36.620 align:middle line:84%
And a lot of rage,
a lot of darkness,

00:11:36.620 --> 00:11:40.027 align:middle line:84%
a lot of violent tendencies,
physical tendencies.

00:11:40.027 --> 00:11:42.110 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: Well, I mean,
it went pretty far, like,

00:11:42.110 --> 00:11:44.568 align:middle line:84%
more extreme than you would
normally hear in that she would

00:11:44.568 --> 00:11:46.430 align:middle line:84%
try to smother you
when you were sleeping.

00:11:46.430 --> 00:11:47.730 align:middle line:90%
>> GRACE: Yep, there was that.

00:11:47.730 --> 00:11:50.660 align:middle line:84%
And I had nail polish
remover in my contact lens,

00:11:50.660 --> 00:11:51.560 align:middle line:90%
almost blinded me.

00:11:51.560 --> 00:11:53.000 align:middle line:90%
I had a hammer to my skull.

00:11:53.000 --> 00:11:55.365 align:middle line:90%
Those were just three of the--

00:11:55.365 --> 00:11:56.990 align:middle line:84%
yeah, it was like
that every single day

00:11:56.990 --> 00:11:58.710 align:middle line:84%
for the first 16
years of my life.

00:11:58.710 --> 00:12:01.430 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: It's just, I mean,
unimaginable that you did not

00:12:01.430 --> 00:12:02.930 align:middle line:90%
choose an exit point.

00:12:02.930 --> 00:12:06.860 align:middle line:84%
>> GRACE: Well,
yeah, it was a lot.

00:12:06.860 --> 00:12:08.570 align:middle line:84%
It was a lot to work
with because here I

00:12:08.570 --> 00:12:10.520 align:middle line:84%
was in the middle
of nowhere, and I

00:12:10.520 --> 00:12:13.670 align:middle line:84%
didn't have the safety and
stability of a nuclear family.

00:12:13.670 --> 00:12:17.520 align:middle line:84%
I didn't understand why my mom
was attacking me in this way.

00:12:17.520 --> 00:12:19.970 align:middle line:84%
And I didn't really have any
support or anybody I could--

00:12:19.970 --> 00:12:20.960 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: Yeah,
she was your mom,

00:12:20.960 --> 00:12:22.543 align:middle line:84%
and you were totally
dependent on her.

00:12:22.543 --> 00:12:23.720 align:middle line:90%
Where was your dad?

00:12:23.720 --> 00:12:26.090 align:middle line:84%
>> GRACE: He was a businessman,
so he was gone a lot,

00:12:26.090 --> 00:12:28.200 align:middle line:84%
just trying to make a
buck back in the day.

00:12:28.200 --> 00:12:29.000 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:12:29.000 --> 00:12:32.690 align:middle line:84%
So I think he was doing his
best with a really untenable

00:12:32.690 --> 00:12:34.100 align:middle line:90%
situation.

00:12:34.100 --> 00:12:36.290 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: You know, it's
interesting when you were

00:12:36.290 --> 00:12:41.390 align:middle line:84%
writing about these episodes
when your mom almost seemed

00:12:41.390 --> 00:12:44.210 align:middle line:84%
to vacate her body, and
I have it written down,

00:12:44.210 --> 00:12:48.230 align:middle line:84%
some of the things-- you said,
her soul would vacate her eyes,

00:12:48.230 --> 00:12:51.680 align:middle line:84%
and her eyes kind
of turned black.

00:12:51.680 --> 00:12:54.950 align:middle line:84%
Her field was filled with
blackness and shards,

00:12:54.950 --> 00:12:59.310 align:middle line:90%
kind of jaggedy shards.

00:12:59.310 --> 00:13:01.950 align:middle line:84%
Have you seen this elsewhere
besides your mother?

00:13:01.950 --> 00:13:05.220 align:middle line:84%
And also, did you see any other
entities around your mother

00:13:05.220 --> 00:13:09.630 align:middle line:84%
that we're feeding off of her,
encouraging her, or enjoying

00:13:09.630 --> 00:13:11.490 align:middle line:90%
this energy she was creating?

00:13:11.490 --> 00:13:15.270 align:middle line:84%
>> GRACE: The intensity of rage
and instability or the energy

00:13:15.270 --> 00:13:19.560 align:middle line:84%
of rage and instability, it
has a very dense frequency,

00:13:19.560 --> 00:13:22.090 align:middle line:84%
and it's almost got this
metallic sheen to it.

00:13:22.090 --> 00:13:25.080 align:middle line:84%
So I didn't understand
what I was seeing as a kid.

00:13:25.080 --> 00:13:28.530 align:middle line:84%
All I would know is that
my mom would be somewhat OK

00:13:28.530 --> 00:13:31.560 align:middle line:84%
and then get triggered
and just turn on a dime

00:13:31.560 --> 00:13:34.140 align:middle line:84%
and go into some
violent rage outburst.

00:13:34.140 --> 00:13:37.800 align:middle line:84%
And in the violent rage
outburst, the mother

00:13:37.800 --> 00:13:39.720 align:middle line:84%
or the individual,
that soul essence

00:13:39.720 --> 00:13:42.780 align:middle line:84%
that I could sort of feel
as a mother would be gone.

00:13:42.780 --> 00:13:45.900 align:middle line:84%
And all I could feel was
this vacuous kind of--

00:13:45.900 --> 00:13:49.560 align:middle line:84%
and it's amazing how their
eyes literally turned black.

00:13:49.560 --> 00:13:53.190 align:middle line:84%
And I've seen that countless
times again in the 911 system.

00:13:53.190 --> 00:13:56.340 align:middle line:84%
But with her, she had-- her
auric field would expand,

00:13:56.340 --> 00:13:58.200 align:middle line:84%
and there'd be like
these metallic, kind

00:13:58.200 --> 00:14:00.660 align:middle line:84%
of barbed energies
coming off of her.

00:14:00.660 --> 00:14:02.520 align:middle line:90%
And again, I didn't understand.

00:14:02.520 --> 00:14:05.610 align:middle line:84%
I didn't know what it was
or why it was like this.

00:14:05.610 --> 00:14:09.370 align:middle line:84%
I was just literally trying to
physically survive at the time.

00:14:09.370 --> 00:14:12.060 align:middle line:84%
And those types of attacks
were so common for me

00:14:12.060 --> 00:14:16.183 align:middle line:84%
that I got very adept
at physical combat.

00:14:16.183 --> 00:14:17.190 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Mm-hmm.

00:14:17.190 --> 00:14:21.092 align:middle line:90%
And also evasive behaviors.

00:14:21.092 --> 00:14:23.550 align:middle line:84%
You know, it was interesting
because as I was reading that,

00:14:23.550 --> 00:14:27.810 align:middle line:84%
I was reminded of a
friend of mine who

00:14:27.810 --> 00:14:30.000 align:middle line:84%
I was witness to a
channeling of theirs

00:14:30.000 --> 00:14:31.770 align:middle line:90%
from a very good channeler.

00:14:31.770 --> 00:14:34.620 align:middle line:84%
And at the end of all
of it, the channeler

00:14:34.620 --> 00:14:36.870 align:middle line:84%
said she was starting
to feel very weak,

00:14:36.870 --> 00:14:38.970 align:middle line:84%
and she actually
became quite sick

00:14:38.970 --> 00:14:40.500 align:middle line:90%
and stayed sick quite a while.

00:14:40.500 --> 00:14:44.220 align:middle line:84%
But what she
revealed to me right

00:14:44.220 --> 00:14:46.170 align:middle line:84%
after the person
left the house, she

00:14:46.170 --> 00:14:48.750 align:middle line:84%
said there's something in
that energy field, where

00:14:48.750 --> 00:14:55.440 align:middle line:84%
it was these geometric
metallic pieces of black

00:14:55.440 --> 00:14:57.100 align:middle line:90%
that she had never seen before.

00:14:57.100 --> 00:15:00.240 align:middle line:90%
And his issue was rage.

00:15:00.240 --> 00:15:02.940 align:middle line:84%
>> GRACE: Yeah, super common,
the frequencies of rage.

00:15:02.940 --> 00:15:04.920 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: But it's interesting
because you've put you've put

00:15:04.920 --> 00:15:05.610 align:middle line:90%
a visual to it.

00:15:05.610 --> 00:15:06.400 align:middle line:90%
>> GRACE: Visual to it.

00:15:06.400 --> 00:15:08.160 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: And that's the only
other time I've heard someone

00:15:08.160 --> 00:15:10.510 align:middle line:84%
put a visual to it
other than that day.

00:15:10.510 --> 00:15:13.770 align:middle line:84%
In fact, he'd been in and
out of mental institutions

00:15:13.770 --> 00:15:16.800 align:middle line:84%
because he couldn't handle
the unfairness of life.

00:15:16.800 --> 00:15:19.800 align:middle line:84%
He'd go berserk when he'd
see unfair things happening,

00:15:19.800 --> 00:15:21.570 align:middle line:84%
lose his bearings, and
they'd haul him off

00:15:21.570 --> 00:15:22.770 align:middle line:90%
at an airport and such.

00:15:22.770 --> 00:15:28.470 align:middle line:84%
But he had that same shard-like,
black, glossy, metallic field.

00:15:28.470 --> 00:15:29.550 align:middle line:90%
>> GRACE: Mm-hmm.

00:15:29.550 --> 00:15:30.810 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Very interesting.

00:15:30.810 --> 00:15:31.610 align:middle line:90%
>> GRACE: Yeah.

00:15:31.610 --> 00:15:33.490 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: So
amidst all of this--

00:15:33.490 --> 00:15:36.150 align:middle line:84%
I mean, you're a
very smart woman.

00:15:36.150 --> 00:15:38.460 align:middle line:84%
You're a very disciplined
person underneath all this.

00:15:38.460 --> 00:15:43.200 align:middle line:84%
And you turn to running
academics, trying

00:15:43.200 --> 00:15:45.910 align:middle line:84%
to prove yourself in
school, and also then you

00:15:45.910 --> 00:15:47.160 align:middle line:90%
became a long-distance runner.

00:15:47.160 --> 00:15:50.100 align:middle line:84%
But it wasn't working for
you with the other girls.

00:15:50.100 --> 00:15:53.050 align:middle line:84%
>> GRACE: Well, ultimately,
underneath everything,

00:15:53.050 --> 00:15:55.330 align:middle line:84%
I was just looking for
safety and identity.

00:15:55.330 --> 00:15:56.130 align:middle line:90%
Right?

00:15:56.130 --> 00:15:58.120 align:middle line:84%
Just like anybody, I
just wanted to fit in.

00:15:58.120 --> 00:15:59.680 align:middle line:90%
I just wanted to be normal.

00:15:59.680 --> 00:16:03.180 align:middle line:84%
And so when I first came
out with my abilities

00:16:03.180 --> 00:16:06.220 align:middle line:84%
at the age of 7, and I said
something to my family,

00:16:06.220 --> 00:16:08.970 align:middle line:84%
to my parents, I got the
hell fire and brimstone,

00:16:08.970 --> 00:16:09.880 align:middle line:90%
like, the shame.

00:16:09.880 --> 00:16:10.680 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Yeah.

00:16:10.680 --> 00:16:14.970 align:middle line:84%
>> GRACE: "Don't ever talk about
that, or we'll send you away,"

00:16:14.970 --> 00:16:16.890 align:middle line:90%
was the actual phrase.

00:16:16.890 --> 00:16:19.140 align:middle line:84%
And so here I am,
this little kid,

00:16:19.140 --> 00:16:22.350 align:middle line:84%
who's now dealing with
all of these energetics

00:16:22.350 --> 00:16:24.820 align:middle line:84%
and just so much
sensory perception.

00:16:24.820 --> 00:16:27.210 align:middle line:84%
And when I go to the
people that I'm, quote,

00:16:27.210 --> 00:16:32.550 align:middle line:84%
"supposed to be able to depend
on," I get shame, condemn.

00:16:32.550 --> 00:16:36.960 align:middle line:84%
And so it was at that
moment that I remember

00:16:36.960 --> 00:16:40.440 align:middle line:84%
it, just like having that
sensation like something's

00:16:40.440 --> 00:16:42.480 align:middle line:90%
really wrong with me, you know?

00:16:42.480 --> 00:16:43.590 align:middle line:90%
Why am I like this?

00:16:43.590 --> 00:16:44.550 align:middle line:90%
I don't want this.

00:16:44.550 --> 00:16:46.240 align:middle line:90%
I don't want to be like this.

00:16:46.240 --> 00:16:48.930 align:middle line:90%
And so that began my odyssey.

00:16:48.930 --> 00:16:53.500 align:middle line:84%
And my initial compensation
for that was overachieving.

00:16:53.500 --> 00:16:54.300 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Yes.

00:16:54.300 --> 00:16:56.910 align:middle line:84%
>> GRACE: And I think as
humans, so oftentimes,

00:16:56.910 --> 00:16:59.970 align:middle line:84%
we do something to
cope with, right?

00:16:59.970 --> 00:17:02.860 align:middle line:84%
Whatever it is that we're
navigating or doing.

00:17:02.860 --> 00:17:05.520 align:middle line:84%
And for me, initially,
it was overachieving.

00:17:05.520 --> 00:17:10.079 align:middle line:84%
So I was doing the long-distance
running and senior class

00:17:10.079 --> 00:17:11.910 align:middle line:84%
president and did
all the things.

00:17:11.910 --> 00:17:14.890 align:middle line:84%
But ultimately, inside
I was so fragile.

00:17:14.890 --> 00:17:15.690 align:middle line:90%
And I was just--

00:17:15.690 --> 00:17:18.390 align:middle line:84%
I was starting to develop
a lot of rage myself

00:17:18.390 --> 00:17:19.510 align:middle line:90%
because I was just like--

00:17:19.510 --> 00:17:20.190 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: How could you not?

00:17:20.190 --> 00:17:21.380 align:middle line:90%
>> GRACE: This sucks.

00:17:21.380 --> 00:17:23.880 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: Because it's unfair,
the unfairness of life to be

00:17:23.880 --> 00:17:25.330 align:middle line:90%
treated like this at home.

00:17:25.330 --> 00:17:26.130 align:middle line:90%
>> GRACE: Yeah.

00:17:26.130 --> 00:17:27.030 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Yeah.

00:17:27.030 --> 00:17:27.830 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:17:27.830 --> 00:17:29.640 align:middle line:84%
And so as you
mentioned earlier, you

00:17:29.640 --> 00:17:32.910 align:middle line:84%
were also starting to connect
in with not just people

00:17:32.910 --> 00:17:35.880 align:middle line:84%
but with nature, with
trees, and so forth.

00:17:35.880 --> 00:17:36.990 align:middle line:90%
I love trees.

00:17:36.990 --> 00:17:39.390 align:middle line:84%
So for just a moment,
you could talk about--

00:17:39.390 --> 00:17:41.490 align:middle line:84%
before we go to
your encounter with

00:17:41.490 --> 00:17:43.300 align:middle line:90%
the Native American entity--

00:17:43.300 --> 00:17:46.950 align:middle line:84%
talk little bit about what
trees were like in your world.

00:17:46.950 --> 00:17:48.090 align:middle line:90%
>> GRACE: Oh, amazing.

00:17:48.090 --> 00:17:50.040 align:middle line:84%
And so they
communicate obviously

00:17:50.040 --> 00:17:52.290 align:middle line:84%
through the mycelial
network underground.

00:17:52.290 --> 00:17:54.540 align:middle line:84%
So if you're
clairaudient, you may be

00:17:54.540 --> 00:17:56.580 align:middle line:90%
able to hear the hum of that.

00:17:56.580 --> 00:17:58.840 align:middle line:84%
And then I can actually
see the canopies

00:17:58.840 --> 00:18:00.880 align:middle line:90%
communicating to each other.

00:18:00.880 --> 00:18:04.660 align:middle line:84%
And it just looks like a lot
of times trees have a golden--

00:18:04.660 --> 00:18:07.982 align:middle line:84%
it looks like very much
matrix-like, vertical data

00:18:07.982 --> 00:18:09.190 align:middle line:90%
going up and down the trunks.

00:18:09.190 --> 00:18:10.900 align:middle line:84%
And then in the
canopy, the energy

00:18:10.900 --> 00:18:12.340 align:middle line:90%
is very golden over the top.

00:18:12.340 --> 00:18:15.422 align:middle line:84%
And they just throw signals
and have little jam sessions

00:18:15.422 --> 00:18:16.630 align:middle line:90%
all the time and communicate.

00:18:16.630 --> 00:18:19.210 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: They just seem like
they're these quiet sentries

00:18:19.210 --> 00:18:21.820 align:middle line:84%
that are here to
protect all, you know,

00:18:21.820 --> 00:18:23.720 align:middle line:84%
even the humans that
pass underneath them.

00:18:23.720 --> 00:18:24.520 align:middle line:90%
>> GRACE: Right.

00:18:24.520 --> 00:18:25.660 align:middle line:90%
Totally.

00:18:25.660 --> 00:18:27.110 align:middle line:90%
A lot of wisdom there, for sure.

00:18:27.110 --> 00:18:27.400 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: A lot of wisdom.

00:18:27.400 --> 00:18:28.960 align:middle line:84%
Have you been to
the Redwood Forest?

00:18:28.960 --> 00:18:29.910 align:middle line:90%
>> GRACE: I have.

00:18:29.910 --> 00:18:30.710 align:middle line:90%
It's beautiful.

00:18:30.710 --> 00:18:33.340 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: That's my favorite
place to be is the Redwood

00:18:33.340 --> 00:18:34.810 align:middle line:90%
Forest up north in California.

00:18:34.810 --> 00:18:35.768 align:middle line:90%
>> GRACE: So beautiful.

00:18:35.768 --> 00:18:38.740 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: Anything unique about
the pattern of those ancient

00:18:38.740 --> 00:18:39.580 align:middle line:90%
wise ones?

00:18:39.580 --> 00:18:41.680 align:middle line:84%
>> GRACE: Oh, you can
just feel the wisdom.

00:18:41.680 --> 00:18:44.080 align:middle line:84%
It's the, you said
it, ancient wisdom,

00:18:44.080 --> 00:18:46.600 align:middle line:84%
so far surpasses our
tiny little, like,

00:18:46.600 --> 00:18:48.760 align:middle line:90%
life spans and life cycles.

00:18:48.760 --> 00:18:51.080 align:middle line:84%
I love just going and
holding touching it.

00:18:51.080 --> 00:18:51.880 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Me too.

00:18:51.880 --> 00:18:54.340 align:middle line:84%
My sister and I both
found out recently,

00:18:54.340 --> 00:18:57.340 align:middle line:84%
I even had it in my
will that when I'm done,

00:18:57.340 --> 00:19:00.340 align:middle line:84%
and this body's done, I want
my ashes spread in this one

00:19:00.340 --> 00:19:01.990 align:middle line:90%
particular grove up there.

00:19:01.990 --> 00:19:04.070 align:middle line:84%
Turns out, she did
the same thing,

00:19:04.070 --> 00:19:05.362 align:middle line:90%
and we never communicated this.

00:19:05.362 --> 00:19:06.162 align:middle line:90%
>> GRACE: No way.

00:19:06.162 --> 00:19:07.780 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: In the
same grove, yeah.

00:19:07.780 --> 00:19:09.203 align:middle line:90%
There's the giant tree there.

00:19:09.203 --> 00:19:10.870 align:middle line:84%
She wants to go where
the giant tree is.

00:19:10.870 --> 00:19:12.760 align:middle line:84%
So anybody who has
a chance to get up

00:19:12.760 --> 00:19:15.010 align:middle line:84%
to the Redwoods in
Northern California, that's

00:19:15.010 --> 00:19:15.460 align:middle line:90%
the most pleasant--

00:19:15.460 --> 00:19:15.850 align:middle line:90%
>> GRACE: Incredible.

00:19:15.850 --> 00:19:17.170 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: --place on Earth.

00:19:17.170 --> 00:19:20.170 align:middle line:84%
So now let's go to the day
where you encountered--

00:19:20.170 --> 00:19:21.110 align:middle line:90%
you're full of rage--

00:19:21.110 --> 00:19:21.910 align:middle line:90%
>> GRACE: Oh, yeah.

00:19:21.910 --> 00:19:23.327 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: --you're
overachieving,

00:19:23.327 --> 00:19:27.250 align:middle line:84%
you're running a lot, and you
encountered the Native American

00:19:27.250 --> 00:19:29.380 align:middle line:84%
because he would come back
and play a role later.

00:19:29.380 --> 00:19:30.380 align:middle line:90%
>> GRACE: Yeah, a big role.

00:19:30.380 --> 00:19:31.180 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Yeah.

00:19:31.180 --> 00:19:35.510 align:middle line:10%
>> GRACE: So I was running
8 to 10 miles a day.

00:19:35.510 --> 00:19:38.630 align:middle line:84%
I had developed by this
point a pretty severe eating

00:19:38.630 --> 00:19:40.700 align:middle line:84%
disorder with
binge-purge cycles,

00:19:40.700 --> 00:19:43.520 align:middle line:84%
just trying to just trying
to control something

00:19:43.520 --> 00:19:46.560 align:middle line:84%
because I didn't have any
control over the stimulus,

00:19:46.560 --> 00:19:49.280 align:middle line:84%
and I didn't have any control
of the physical safety.

00:19:49.280 --> 00:19:51.450 align:middle line:84%
So I was just trying
to control something.

00:19:51.450 --> 00:19:53.840 align:middle line:84%
And so I would go
out just to be away,

00:19:53.840 --> 00:19:55.100 align:middle line:90%
just to be out of the house.

00:19:55.100 --> 00:19:59.870 align:middle line:84%
And remember, this is a town of
2,000 people in South Dakota,

00:19:59.870 --> 00:20:00.750 align:middle line:90%
way out there.

00:20:00.750 --> 00:20:03.020 align:middle line:84%
So I would just go way
off into the prairie

00:20:03.020 --> 00:20:07.950 align:middle line:84%
and go running by myself,
and I could still sense--

00:20:07.950 --> 00:20:10.782 align:middle line:84%
so for me, running
became very meditative.

00:20:10.782 --> 00:20:12.740 align:middle line:84%
And I didn't know what
I was doing at the time.

00:20:12.740 --> 00:20:15.110 align:middle line:84%
I just knew that I
needed to move my body

00:20:15.110 --> 00:20:17.480 align:middle line:90%
and escape the house.

00:20:17.480 --> 00:20:21.230 align:middle line:84%
But the cadence of my
footsteps and the rhythm

00:20:21.230 --> 00:20:23.300 align:middle line:84%
of my breath going
in and out, I later

00:20:23.300 --> 00:20:25.580 align:middle line:84%
came to understand it
was helping me to ground.

00:20:25.580 --> 00:20:27.500 align:middle line:84%
It was helping me
to kind of transmute

00:20:27.500 --> 00:20:30.110 align:middle line:90%
a lot of that excess energy.

00:20:30.110 --> 00:20:31.970 align:middle line:90%
But I was having a day.

00:20:31.970 --> 00:20:34.220 align:middle line:84%
I was not in a good
headspace anyway,

00:20:34.220 --> 00:20:38.150 align:middle line:84%
and then a little
Native American female

00:20:38.150 --> 00:20:39.890 align:middle line:90%
appeared in spirit.

00:20:39.890 --> 00:20:42.710 align:middle line:84%
And I got mad because I just
wanted to be left alone.

00:20:42.710 --> 00:20:45.060 align:middle line:84%
So I picked up some rocks
and I threw it at her.

00:20:45.060 --> 00:20:45.860 align:middle line:90%
Right?

00:20:45.860 --> 00:20:48.890 align:middle line:84%
And I'm screaming at the sky
like a lunatic, you know?

00:20:48.890 --> 00:20:50.300 align:middle line:90%
But I'm just done.

00:20:50.300 --> 00:20:52.130 align:middle line:90%
I was just so done.

00:20:52.130 --> 00:20:54.560 align:middle line:84%
And I just started
sprinting down the road

00:20:54.560 --> 00:20:56.360 align:middle line:84%
because I wanted
to be left alone.

00:20:56.360 --> 00:20:58.610 align:middle line:84%
And of course, I
tripped and just,

00:20:58.610 --> 00:21:00.590 align:middle line:84%
like, launched to the
air and just, like,

00:21:00.590 --> 00:21:02.352 align:middle line:84%
somersaulted across
the dirt road,

00:21:02.352 --> 00:21:04.310 align:middle line:84%
and all the rocks were,
like, scraping into me.

00:21:04.310 --> 00:21:05.570 align:middle line:90%
I just laid there.

00:21:05.570 --> 00:21:08.150 align:middle line:84%
And I still remember it
because the South Dakota

00:21:08.150 --> 00:21:11.450 align:middle line:84%
has a huge sky, and
this wind, right?

00:21:11.450 --> 00:21:15.130 align:middle line:84%
And you can always hear the
little bugs and the birds

00:21:15.130 --> 00:21:15.930 align:middle line:90%
and everything.

00:21:15.930 --> 00:21:18.170 align:middle line:84%
And I was just laying
there in a heap, just

00:21:18.170 --> 00:21:20.870 align:middle line:84%
really feeling sorry for myself
because I was like, I don't

00:21:20.870 --> 00:21:22.430 align:middle line:90%
want to deal with any of this.

00:21:22.430 --> 00:21:24.230 align:middle line:90%
This sucks, you know.

00:21:24.230 --> 00:21:28.310 align:middle line:84%
And I felt all of a sudden,
this prickling on my back,

00:21:28.310 --> 00:21:30.990 align:middle line:84%
this very warm energy
starting to happen.

00:21:30.990 --> 00:21:34.550 align:middle line:84%
And it was incredible
because it was almost like

00:21:34.550 --> 00:21:38.630 align:middle line:84%
if you felt the sunrise
coming onto your skin.

00:21:38.630 --> 00:21:41.570 align:middle line:84%
And all of a sudden,
everything began to illuminate.

00:21:41.570 --> 00:21:44.240 align:middle line:84%
So if you think of going from
a normal-color television

00:21:44.240 --> 00:21:46.190 align:middle line:84%
to a technicolor
television, everything just

00:21:46.190 --> 00:21:48.320 align:middle line:90%
got very amplified.

00:21:48.320 --> 00:21:50.120 align:middle line:84%
And I didn't know
what was going on.

00:21:50.120 --> 00:21:52.100 align:middle line:84%
I'm just laying
there in the ditch.

00:21:52.100 --> 00:21:53.430 align:middle line:90%
And I roll over.

00:21:53.430 --> 00:21:56.720 align:middle line:84%
And I look and
there's this full--

00:21:56.720 --> 00:22:00.140 align:middle line:84%
I believe he was a
Lakota Sioux because that

00:22:00.140 --> 00:22:03.470 align:middle line:84%
was the tribe of the
area that I was in.

00:22:03.470 --> 00:22:06.350 align:middle line:84%
Chief with a full headdress
sitting on a horse,

00:22:06.350 --> 00:22:08.330 align:middle line:90%
and he's in spirit.

00:22:08.330 --> 00:22:16.940 align:middle line:84%
And I was hit with the most
profound omnipresent sensation.

00:22:16.940 --> 00:22:18.965 align:middle line:90%
It was just speechless.

00:22:18.965 --> 00:22:22.217 align:middle line:84%
It's like standing before
God, if you could imagine

00:22:22.217 --> 00:22:23.300 align:middle line:90%
what that could feel like.

00:22:23.300 --> 00:22:25.625 align:middle line:84%
And all of a sudden, I
felt really like a schlep,

00:22:25.625 --> 00:22:28.123 align:middle line:84%
sitting down there in the
dirt like-- and I didn't--

00:22:28.123 --> 00:22:30.290 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: Throwing rocks
at the other spirit guide.

00:22:30.290 --> 00:22:31.332 align:middle line:90%
>> GRACE: Throwing rocks.

00:22:31.332 --> 00:22:33.350 align:middle line:84%
And I was like, are you
here-- are you mad at me

00:22:33.350 --> 00:22:34.610 align:middle line:90%
because I threw a rock at her?

00:22:34.610 --> 00:22:35.630 align:middle line:90%
I'm sorry.

00:22:35.630 --> 00:22:37.220 align:middle line:90%
I didn't know, you know?

00:22:37.220 --> 00:22:40.070 align:middle line:90%
And he didn't move his mouth.

00:22:40.070 --> 00:22:41.960 align:middle line:84%
Everything was
telepathic, and he just

00:22:41.960 --> 00:22:44.270 align:middle line:90%
was staring directly at me.

00:22:44.270 --> 00:22:46.070 align:middle line:90%
And he was holding the staff.

00:22:46.070 --> 00:22:50.090 align:middle line:84%
And again, I got this
message of, hold on.

00:22:50.090 --> 00:22:53.270 align:middle line:84%
This is hard, but you
stay on this path,

00:22:53.270 --> 00:22:54.810 align:middle line:84%
and it's all going
to make sense.

00:22:54.810 --> 00:22:59.420 align:middle line:84%
And it was just like this
swirling of iridescent energy.

00:22:59.420 --> 00:23:00.720 align:middle line:90%
It was so incredible.

00:23:00.720 --> 00:23:01.610 align:middle line:90%
And then boom.

00:23:01.610 --> 00:23:03.950 align:middle line:90%
Just like that, they disappear.

00:23:03.950 --> 00:23:06.140 align:middle line:90%
And I just laid there.

00:23:06.140 --> 00:23:07.310 align:middle line:90%
Again, what am I?

00:23:07.310 --> 00:23:09.125 align:middle line:90%
14, 15?

00:23:09.125 --> 00:23:11.870 align:middle line:84%
Just really kind of
a hot mess, trying

00:23:11.870 --> 00:23:14.480 align:middle line:84%
to cope with all
of the instability.

00:23:14.480 --> 00:23:17.990 align:middle line:84%
And then all of a sudden,
I see this tremendous--

00:23:17.990 --> 00:23:19.610 align:middle line:84%
and he's still, to
this day, I've only

00:23:19.610 --> 00:23:21.480 align:middle line:90%
seen him a handful of times.

00:23:21.480 --> 00:23:24.320 align:middle line:84%
He only comes in at those
pivotal moments where

00:23:24.320 --> 00:23:27.630 align:middle line:90%
it's like, Sarah is about done.

00:23:27.630 --> 00:23:30.440 align:middle line:84%
He'll come in and just give
me that gentle little reminder

00:23:30.440 --> 00:23:33.610 align:middle line:90%
of you can do this.

00:23:33.610 --> 00:23:36.110 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: So now you get ready,
you're graduating from high

00:23:36.110 --> 00:23:36.910 align:middle line:90%
school--

00:23:36.910 --> 00:23:39.720 align:middle line:84%
we'll kind of hop through some
of this-- and your mother dies.

00:23:39.720 --> 00:23:40.520 align:middle line:90%
>> GRACE: She did.

00:23:40.520 --> 00:23:42.320 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: Wasn't it
on your graduation day

00:23:42.320 --> 00:23:42.710 align:middle line:90%
or at the ceremony?

00:23:42.710 --> 00:23:43.280 align:middle line:90%
>> GRACE: Oh, yeah.

00:23:43.280 --> 00:23:44.080 align:middle line:90%
It was just that.

00:23:44.080 --> 00:23:46.040 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: Wow, stealing
the thunder, man.

00:23:46.040 --> 00:23:51.890 align:middle line:84%
>> GRACE: Well, she had a
non-Hodgkin's cancer diagnosis.

00:23:51.890 --> 00:23:54.000 align:middle line:84%
And diagnosis to
death was six months,

00:23:54.000 --> 00:23:55.680 align:middle line:90%
so it was relatively quick.

00:23:55.680 --> 00:23:57.660 align:middle line:90%
And now I come to understand.

00:23:57.660 --> 00:23:58.460 align:middle line:90%
I get it.

00:23:58.460 --> 00:24:01.397 align:middle line:84%
She was hurting
as a soul anyways.

00:24:01.397 --> 00:24:02.480 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: She needed out.

00:24:02.480 --> 00:24:03.813 align:middle line:90%
>> GRACE: Yeah, she was over it.

00:24:03.813 --> 00:24:05.900 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:24:05.900 --> 00:24:07.670 align:middle line:84%
But she had gone
through treatment,

00:24:07.670 --> 00:24:11.900 align:middle line:84%
and she was frail and showed up
at my high school graduation.

00:24:11.900 --> 00:24:14.780 align:middle line:84%
And I remember her
being in the crowd.

00:24:14.780 --> 00:24:17.600 align:middle line:84%
And then she came to
the party afterwards,

00:24:17.600 --> 00:24:19.640 align:middle line:84%
and we were standing
next to the cake.

00:24:19.640 --> 00:24:22.880 align:middle line:84%
And I'll always remember it
had "Congratulations, Sarah,"

00:24:22.880 --> 00:24:23.820 align:middle line:90%
in red.

00:24:23.820 --> 00:24:26.120 align:middle line:84%
And I was standing
there speaking with her.

00:24:26.120 --> 00:24:30.710 align:middle line:84%
And she's no hair, emaciated,
very unhealthy, very frail.

00:24:30.710 --> 00:24:32.540 align:middle line:84%
And her eyes rolled
back into her head,

00:24:32.540 --> 00:24:35.030 align:middle line:84%
and she dropped to the
floor in a grand mal seizure

00:24:35.030 --> 00:24:36.800 align:middle line:90%
right next to my cake.

00:24:36.800 --> 00:24:37.620 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Right.

00:24:37.620 --> 00:24:40.160 align:middle line:84%
>> GRACE: And I
was just like, ugh.

00:24:40.160 --> 00:24:42.920 align:middle line:84%
I mean, it was just blow
after blow for like, you know.

00:24:42.920 --> 00:24:43.970 align:middle line:90%
And I was like, ugh.

00:24:43.970 --> 00:24:45.350 align:middle line:90%
So she didn't die.

00:24:45.350 --> 00:24:47.498 align:middle line:84%
She had a big seizure,
and they transported her.

00:24:47.498 --> 00:24:49.290 align:middle line:84%
But that was the last
time I saw her alive.

00:24:49.290 --> 00:24:49.610 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Yeah.

00:24:49.610 --> 00:24:50.445 align:middle line:90%
>> GRACE: Yeah.

00:24:50.445 --> 00:24:51.860 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: OK, so
you go on to college,

00:24:51.860 --> 00:24:52.820 align:middle line:90%
and now you try to excel.

00:24:52.820 --> 00:24:54.445 align:middle line:84%
But you really are
kind of on your own.

00:24:54.445 --> 00:24:59.150 align:middle line:84%
I mean, you don't even have the
dysfunctional mother situation

00:24:59.150 --> 00:25:01.580 align:middle line:84%
as a weird anchor
in life anymore.

00:25:01.580 --> 00:25:03.270 align:middle line:90%
You really are on your own.

00:25:03.270 --> 00:25:08.300 align:middle line:84%
And that's not so easy for
you to fit in in college.

00:25:08.300 --> 00:25:12.320 align:middle line:84%
Plus, you go to the lunchroom,
and it's like, oh, stop.

00:25:12.320 --> 00:25:14.900 align:middle line:84%
You're seeing and hearing
everything going on in there

00:25:14.900 --> 00:25:18.260 align:middle line:84%
with all these other
teenagers and early 20s.

00:25:18.260 --> 00:25:21.620 align:middle line:84%
And then you
discovered ephedrine.

00:25:21.620 --> 00:25:22.497 align:middle line:90%
>> GRACE: Oh, yeah.

00:25:22.497 --> 00:25:24.330 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: And suddenly,
the voices stopped.

00:25:24.330 --> 00:25:26.000 align:middle line:84%
So let's talk about
your drug experience

00:25:26.000 --> 00:25:29.210 align:middle line:84%
going into the interesting
career choice after that.

00:25:29.210 --> 00:25:30.050 align:middle line:90%
>> GRACE: Yes.

00:25:30.050 --> 00:25:30.850 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

00:25:30.850 --> 00:25:32.540 align:middle line:90%
It was, indeed.

00:25:32.540 --> 00:25:36.170 align:middle line:90%
So my world imploded.

00:25:36.170 --> 00:25:39.440 align:middle line:84%
It was violent for the first 16
years, and then my mom got sick

00:25:39.440 --> 00:25:40.310 align:middle line:90%
and suddenly died.

00:25:40.310 --> 00:25:42.050 align:middle line:84%
And then it's like,
oh, congratulations,

00:25:42.050 --> 00:25:43.370 align:middle line:90%
you graduated high school now.

00:25:43.370 --> 00:25:44.220 align:middle line:90%
Go live your life.

00:25:44.220 --> 00:25:45.860 align:middle line:84%
And there was, like,
no preparation.

00:25:45.860 --> 00:25:47.150 align:middle line:90%
I didn't have any foundation.

00:25:47.150 --> 00:25:51.110 align:middle line:84%
I didn't understand how to
cook, how to function as a human

00:25:51.110 --> 00:25:53.270 align:middle line:84%
because I had been
literally in survival mode.

00:25:53.270 --> 00:25:54.070 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Right.

00:25:54.070 --> 00:25:56.110 align:middle line:84%
>> GRACE: And so then
it's like, OK, good luck.

00:25:56.110 --> 00:25:56.910 align:middle line:90%
Go over there.

00:25:56.910 --> 00:26:01.610 align:middle line:84%
And so I felt like
I was floating.

00:26:01.610 --> 00:26:02.960 align:middle line:90%
I didn't have any base.

00:26:02.960 --> 00:26:04.320 align:middle line:90%
I didn't have any structure.

00:26:04.320 --> 00:26:05.930 align:middle line:84%
I didn't have any
family support.

00:26:05.930 --> 00:26:08.810 align:middle line:84%
And I wasn't self-aware
or self-connected

00:26:08.810 --> 00:26:11.580 align:middle line:84%
at the time, awash
in all of that.

00:26:11.580 --> 00:26:14.930 align:middle line:90%
And so I had started smoking.

00:26:14.930 --> 00:26:17.000 align:middle line:84%
I started smoking
three packs a day.

00:26:17.000 --> 00:26:18.780 align:middle line:84%
I'm one of those go
big or go home people.

00:26:18.780 --> 00:26:19.580 align:middle line:90%
Right?

00:26:19.580 --> 00:26:20.990 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Clearly.

00:26:20.990 --> 00:26:22.310 align:middle line:90%
Well, yeah, you could see that.

00:26:22.310 --> 00:26:23.600 align:middle line:90%
>> GRACE: And I was drinking.

00:26:23.600 --> 00:26:28.470 align:middle line:10%
And I was just trying to
anesthetize everything.

00:26:28.470 --> 00:26:31.340 align:middle line:84%
And I had a friend who
worked at this truck stop.

00:26:31.340 --> 00:26:32.870 align:middle line:84%
And I'll never
forget this, Regina,

00:26:32.870 --> 00:26:35.690 align:middle line:84%
because he was like, oh, have
you ever heard of ephedrine?

00:26:35.690 --> 00:26:37.970 align:middle line:84%
And it was the NoDoz back
in the day for truckers.

00:26:37.970 --> 00:26:38.270 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Yeah.

00:26:38.270 --> 00:26:39.020 align:middle line:90%
It was legal.

00:26:39.020 --> 00:26:39.820 align:middle line:90%
>> GRACE: Yeah.

00:26:39.820 --> 00:26:41.940 align:middle line:84%
It was like pure form,
100% meth is what it was.

00:26:41.940 --> 00:26:42.740 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Yeah.

00:26:42.740 --> 00:26:45.015 align:middle line:84%
>> GRACE: And $6.99
a bottle, right?

00:26:45.015 --> 00:26:45.890 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: And legal.

00:26:45.890 --> 00:26:47.210 align:middle line:90%
>> GRACE: And legal.

00:26:47.210 --> 00:26:48.950 align:middle line:90%
So I was like, tried it.

00:26:48.950 --> 00:26:51.320 align:middle line:84%
And it said take
one, so of course, I

00:26:51.320 --> 00:26:52.700 align:middle line:84%
would take two or
three because I

00:26:52.700 --> 00:26:54.180 align:middle line:90%
thought that'd be a great idea.

00:26:54.180 --> 00:26:57.350 align:middle line:84%
And the only thing
I understood though,

00:26:57.350 --> 00:26:59.390 align:middle line:84%
Regina, was that
the accelerants,

00:26:59.390 --> 00:27:03.800 align:middle line:84%
the speedies, those things, for
the very first time in my life,

00:27:03.800 --> 00:27:05.430 align:middle line:90%
brought the stimulus down.

00:27:05.430 --> 00:27:06.230 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Yeah.

00:27:06.230 --> 00:27:07.790 align:middle line:84%
>> GRACE: Brought
the stimulus down.

00:27:07.790 --> 00:27:10.850 align:middle line:84%
If there was any-- if I did
any alcohol or any depressants,

00:27:10.850 --> 00:27:13.130 align:middle line:84%
the energetics would
actually increase.

00:27:13.130 --> 00:27:15.330 align:middle line:84%
And it would get even
more intense for me.

00:27:15.330 --> 00:27:16.130 align:middle line:90%
But anything--

00:27:16.130 --> 00:27:17.540 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: Kind of
like Ritalin to a kid.

00:27:17.540 --> 00:27:18.980 align:middle line:90%
>> GRACE: Ritalin, Adderall.

00:27:18.980 --> 00:27:19.400 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Adderall.

00:27:19.400 --> 00:27:20.630 align:middle line:84%
>> GRACE: That' why
they do it for ADHD.

00:27:20.630 --> 00:27:21.410 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Exactly.

00:27:21.410 --> 00:27:21.680 align:middle line:90%
>> GRACE: Mm-hmm.

00:27:21.680 --> 00:27:23.660 align:middle line:84%
Same thing in the
neurochemistry of the brain.

00:27:23.660 --> 00:27:25.340 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: It worked for
you kind of a little bit

00:27:25.340 --> 00:27:26.140 align:middle line:90%
for a little while.

00:27:26.140 --> 00:27:26.940 align:middle line:90%
>> GRACE: Yes.

00:27:26.940 --> 00:27:28.640 align:middle line:84%
It was a crutch
for a little while,

00:27:28.640 --> 00:27:30.680 align:middle line:84%
but it was really
kind of my gateway.

00:27:30.680 --> 00:27:34.880 align:middle line:90%
And I really started to--

00:27:34.880 --> 00:27:37.290 align:middle line:84%
well, I went off the rails
at a hundred miles an hour.

00:27:37.290 --> 00:27:40.430 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: So we'll kind of get
through the career choice kind

00:27:40.430 --> 00:27:43.250 align:middle line:84%
of quickly because we want
to get to once you became

00:27:43.250 --> 00:27:45.620 align:middle line:84%
a paramedic, some of these
experiences you started

00:27:45.620 --> 00:27:46.850 align:middle line:84%
witnessing, and what
you're doing today.

00:27:46.850 --> 00:27:48.517 align:middle line:84%
I want to leave plenty
of time for that,

00:27:48.517 --> 00:27:50.420 align:middle line:84%
but just so people
understand your journey

00:27:50.420 --> 00:27:51.260 align:middle line:90%
and what you've been through.

00:27:51.260 --> 00:27:52.760 align:middle line:84%
So a girlfriend
said, hey, we should

00:27:52.760 --> 00:27:54.020 align:middle line:90%
go do a stripping contest.

00:27:54.020 --> 00:27:54.560 align:middle line:90%
>> GRACE: Yes, she did.

00:27:54.560 --> 00:27:55.360 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Yeah.

00:27:55.360 --> 00:27:57.525 align:middle line:84%
And you're like--
and you said, I'm in.

00:27:57.525 --> 00:27:58.325 align:middle line:90%
>> GRACE: 100%.

00:27:58.325 --> 00:27:59.000 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: She's like, no, no.

00:27:59.000 --> 00:27:59.800 align:middle line:90%
I'm kidding.

00:27:59.800 --> 00:28:01.650 align:middle line:90%
You said, I'm not.

00:28:01.650 --> 00:28:02.450 align:middle line:90%
>> GRACE: Totally.

00:28:02.450 --> 00:28:03.170 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: So you
went and did it.

00:28:03.170 --> 00:28:04.040 align:middle line:90%
So you had it--

00:28:04.040 --> 00:28:04.820 align:middle line:90%
>> GRACE: That's what happened.

00:28:04.820 --> 00:28:06.110 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Now you had power.

00:28:06.110 --> 00:28:07.010 align:middle line:90%
And you had drugs.

00:28:07.010 --> 00:28:09.600 align:middle line:84%
And you had power over your
life, you were making money.

00:28:09.600 --> 00:28:10.400 align:middle line:90%
>> GRACE: Money.

00:28:10.400 --> 00:28:12.440 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: You could
actually kind of see a path

00:28:12.440 --> 00:28:13.380 align:middle line:90%
for yourself.

00:28:13.380 --> 00:28:16.550 align:middle line:84%
>> GRACE: I went into a world,
and it was more of the shadowy

00:28:16.550 --> 00:28:17.510 align:middle line:90%
kind of world.

00:28:17.510 --> 00:28:20.578 align:middle line:84%
But I could under-- well, one,
I was familiar with shadow

00:28:20.578 --> 00:28:21.620 align:middle line:90%
with what I grew up with.

00:28:21.620 --> 00:28:21.950 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Yes.

00:28:21.950 --> 00:28:22.750 align:middle line:90%
>> GRACE: Right?

00:28:22.750 --> 00:28:24.882 align:middle line:84%
And two, I started to
see it for what it was,

00:28:24.882 --> 00:28:26.090 align:middle line:90%
which is just kind of a game.

00:28:26.090 --> 00:28:27.560 align:middle line:90%
It's an energetic game, right?

00:28:27.560 --> 00:28:27.815 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Right.

00:28:27.815 --> 00:28:29.020 align:middle line:90%
>> GRACE: Between the dancers--

00:28:29.020 --> 00:28:30.140 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: And you
were gaming it.

00:28:30.140 --> 00:28:30.380 align:middle line:90%
>> GRACE: Exactly.

00:28:30.380 --> 00:28:31.640 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: And you were
making some good money.

00:28:31.640 --> 00:28:32.270 align:middle line:90%
>> GRACE: Yeah.

00:28:32.270 --> 00:28:34.478 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: And I want to
talk about one thing in this

00:28:34.478 --> 00:28:36.195 align:middle line:84%
because I found it
interesting, again,

00:28:36.195 --> 00:28:38.570 align:middle line:84%
because I was kind of, like,
reading about the energetics

00:28:38.570 --> 00:28:39.370 align:middle line:90%
of it.

00:28:39.370 --> 00:28:41.300 align:middle line:84%
What you would see
coming off of the men

00:28:41.300 --> 00:28:44.810 align:middle line:84%
when they were in the strip
places, when the girls are

00:28:44.810 --> 00:28:48.590 align:middle line:84%
doing lap dances and so
forth, and the entities

00:28:48.590 --> 00:28:49.940 align:middle line:90%
that are lurking around.

00:28:49.940 --> 00:28:52.910 align:middle line:84%
Give us a snapshot of what
it's like in a strip club

00:28:52.910 --> 00:28:54.740 align:middle line:84%
from an energetic
point of view working

00:28:54.740 --> 00:28:56.360 align:middle line:84%
through the men
that are attending.

00:28:56.360 --> 00:29:02.240 align:middle line:84%
>> GRACE: Usually, a lot of
ruddy-colored, orange-colored,

00:29:02.240 --> 00:29:05.990 align:middle line:84%
root and sacral chakra energy
that would come out almost

00:29:05.990 --> 00:29:08.300 align:middle line:84%
towards the dancers,
so to speak.

00:29:08.300 --> 00:29:10.400 align:middle line:84%
Usually, the dancers
are quite closed.

00:29:10.400 --> 00:29:12.020 align:middle line:90%
They act like, it's--

00:29:12.020 --> 00:29:13.310 align:middle line:90%
again, it's that game.

00:29:13.310 --> 00:29:14.540 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: Yeah, but
their field is closed.

00:29:14.540 --> 00:29:14.970 align:middle line:90%
>> GRACE: Their field is closed.

00:29:14.970 --> 00:29:15.770 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: They're tough.

00:29:15.770 --> 00:29:16.570 align:middle line:90%
>> GRACE: Right.

00:29:16.570 --> 00:29:20.580 align:middle line:84%
And then there's a lot of
alcohol in places like that

00:29:20.580 --> 00:29:24.290 align:middle line:84%
and a lot of kind of fringe
characters with pimps

00:29:24.290 --> 00:29:26.600 align:middle line:84%
and people that were on
the peripheral of that.

00:29:26.600 --> 00:29:28.100 align:middle line:84%
So those types of
people would bring

00:29:28.100 --> 00:29:31.350 align:middle line:84%
in some really heavy,
dark energies as well.

00:29:31.350 --> 00:29:34.710 align:middle line:84%
And so the men, it would be
very lustful and kind of crude.

00:29:34.710 --> 00:29:38.040 align:middle line:84%
And the new compile it with
any sort of drugs or alcohol,

00:29:38.040 --> 00:29:40.140 align:middle line:84%
and the energetics
just get really messy.

00:29:40.140 --> 00:29:42.450 align:middle line:84%
But there was a
lot of that sheen

00:29:42.450 --> 00:29:46.860 align:middle line:84%
with kind of this silvery
sheen and the darker sheens.

00:29:46.860 --> 00:29:50.040 align:middle line:84%
There was a lot of that in there
because ultimately, from us,

00:29:50.040 --> 00:29:52.110 align:middle line:84%
for a lot of us, we
were coming from,

00:29:52.110 --> 00:29:54.780 align:middle line:84%
obviously, I was
very traumatized,

00:29:54.780 --> 00:29:56.640 align:middle line:84%
and I didn't have
safety or stability.

00:29:56.640 --> 00:29:58.828 align:middle line:84%
And a lot of the other
girls had been, you know.

00:29:58.828 --> 00:30:00.120 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Traumatized as well.

00:30:00.120 --> 00:30:01.250 align:middle line:84%
>> GRACE: Traumatized
or sexually assaulted.

00:30:01.250 --> 00:30:04.050 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: But some of them
were just students also or young

00:30:04.050 --> 00:30:06.702 align:middle line:84%
moms just trying to find a
way to make some real money.

00:30:06.702 --> 00:30:08.910 align:middle line:84%
>> GRACE: One of my friends
there was putting herself

00:30:08.910 --> 00:30:09.710 align:middle line:90%
through med school.

00:30:09.710 --> 00:30:12.450 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: Yeah, because minimum
wage wasn't cutting it working

00:30:12.450 --> 00:30:13.860 align:middle line:90%
as a sales clerk somewhere.

00:30:13.860 --> 00:30:17.335 align:middle line:84%
So for every reason, you
all ended up in this place.

00:30:17.335 --> 00:30:18.210 align:middle line:90%
>> GRACE: This place.

00:30:18.210 --> 00:30:20.543 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: Well, it had its
day, and then that was gone.

00:30:20.543 --> 00:30:23.740 align:middle line:84%
And ultimately, you
ended up meeting a man.

00:30:23.740 --> 00:30:24.540 align:middle line:90%
>> GRACE: Mm-hmm.

00:30:24.540 --> 00:30:25.800 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: Dave, I
think, his name was?

00:30:25.800 --> 00:30:26.600 align:middle line:90%
>> GRACE: Yes.

00:30:26.600 --> 00:30:28.620 align:middle line:84%
But it's important
to note, Regina,

00:30:28.620 --> 00:30:31.290 align:middle line:84%
though, because I was
in such a fragile state,

00:30:31.290 --> 00:30:34.380 align:middle line:84%
I was using a lot of
substances to try to make

00:30:34.380 --> 00:30:35.860 align:middle line:90%
myself feel powerful and safe.

00:30:35.860 --> 00:30:36.660 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Yes.

00:30:36.660 --> 00:30:39.655 align:middle line:84%
>> GRACE: And that as a culture
is what a lot of people do,

00:30:39.655 --> 00:30:40.455 align:middle line:90%
right?

00:30:40.455 --> 00:30:40.710 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Yeah.

00:30:40.710 --> 00:30:42.900 align:middle line:84%
>> GRACE: I took it way
over here, you know.

00:30:42.900 --> 00:30:45.120 align:middle line:84%
But a lot of people come
home and have a few beers.

00:30:45.120 --> 00:30:46.770 align:middle line:84%
Or they'll do a
little-- whatever

00:30:46.770 --> 00:30:49.920 align:middle line:84%
they do because we're all
trying to navigate the intensity

00:30:49.920 --> 00:30:50.970 align:middle line:90%
of this human experience.

00:30:50.970 --> 00:30:51.300 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Yes.

00:30:51.300 --> 00:30:52.100 align:middle line:90%
>> GRACE: Right?

00:30:52.100 --> 00:30:56.090 align:middle line:84%
So I was in that space, kind
of playing this game, try

00:30:56.090 --> 00:30:58.650 align:middle line:84%
and thinking I was, like,
getting a handle on it,

00:30:58.650 --> 00:31:00.540 align:middle line:90%
but deeply insecure.

00:31:00.540 --> 00:31:04.050 align:middle line:84%
And one night, I left the
club at 5:00 in the morning,

00:31:04.050 --> 00:31:05.740 align:middle line:90%
and I woke up three days later.

00:31:05.740 --> 00:31:06.540 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Yeah.

00:31:06.540 --> 00:31:08.970 align:middle line:84%
>> GRACE: In my car in the
middle of the state with no

00:31:08.970 --> 00:31:09.930 align:middle line:90%
recollection.

00:31:09.930 --> 00:31:10.170 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Yeah.

00:31:10.170 --> 00:31:11.490 align:middle line:84%
>> GRACE: And my
pants were down.

00:31:11.490 --> 00:31:12.290 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Yeah.

00:31:12.290 --> 00:31:14.730 align:middle line:84%
>> GRACE: So, very clearly,
there had been an assault.

00:31:14.730 --> 00:31:20.490 align:middle line:84%
And it's important to share
this because of what happened.

00:31:20.490 --> 00:31:25.242 align:middle line:84%
When I got home, I just blew
apart, like that had been--

00:31:25.242 --> 00:31:26.700 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: That
was your low point.

00:31:26.700 --> 00:31:28.920 align:middle line:84%
>> GRACE: That was
the lowest for me.

00:31:28.920 --> 00:31:30.910 align:middle line:84%
And that's when I
decided to overdose.

00:31:30.910 --> 00:31:31.710 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Right.

00:31:31.710 --> 00:31:34.380 align:middle line:84%
>> GRACE: And I overdosed on
some pills because that's when

00:31:34.380 --> 00:31:35.340 align:middle line:84%
I was like, all
right, that's it.

00:31:35.340 --> 00:31:36.130 align:middle line:90%
I'm done.

00:31:36.130 --> 00:31:36.930 align:middle line:90%
Screw this.

00:31:36.930 --> 00:31:38.953 align:middle line:84%
It was 16 years of
physical violence--

00:31:38.953 --> 00:31:40.620 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: You weren't
seeing the light.

00:31:40.620 --> 00:31:43.740 align:middle line:84%
>> GRACE: --and all of this
energetic stimulus with no help

00:31:43.740 --> 00:31:46.350 align:middle line:84%
and no safety, no
love, no structure,

00:31:46.350 --> 00:31:49.420 align:middle line:90%
and just trying to survive it.

00:31:49.420 --> 00:31:53.130 align:middle line:84%
And so I had formulated
this experience for myself

00:31:53.130 --> 00:31:54.810 align:middle line:84%
where I felt a
semblance of power,

00:31:54.810 --> 00:31:57.000 align:middle line:90%
and then that got yanked too.

00:31:57.000 --> 00:31:58.260 align:middle line:90%
And so I was like, screw it.

00:31:58.260 --> 00:31:59.060 align:middle line:90%
I'm out.

00:31:59.060 --> 00:32:00.310 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: So you didn't die.

00:32:00.310 --> 00:32:03.450 align:middle line:84%
>> GRACE: I had my near-death
experience, and I expanded out.

00:32:03.450 --> 00:32:06.570 align:middle line:84%
And I went into this
beautiful fractal state.

00:32:06.570 --> 00:32:08.730 align:middle line:90%
And it was very yummy and warm.

00:32:08.730 --> 00:32:12.990 align:middle line:84%
And there was a female energy,
and her voice was familiar,

00:32:12.990 --> 00:32:14.110 align:middle line:90%
but I don't know.

00:32:14.110 --> 00:32:14.910 align:middle line:90%
Right?

00:32:14.910 --> 00:32:16.785 align:middle line:84%
So you just know who it
is, but you might not

00:32:16.785 --> 00:32:18.608 align:middle line:90%
know in this incarnation.

00:32:18.608 --> 00:32:21.150 align:middle line:84%
Essentially, she was much more
eloquent than I'm about to be.

00:32:21.150 --> 00:32:23.200 align:middle line:90%
But she was like, we get it.

00:32:23.200 --> 00:32:24.000 align:middle line:90%
We get it.

00:32:24.000 --> 00:32:26.040 align:middle line:90%
It's been hard for you, right?

00:32:26.040 --> 00:32:28.680 align:middle line:84%
But if you choose
to stay, you're

00:32:28.680 --> 00:32:31.978 align:middle line:84%
going to be able to help
a lot of people with this.

00:32:31.978 --> 00:32:34.020 align:middle line:84%
And I was like-- at first,
I didn't want anything

00:32:34.020 --> 00:32:34.470 align:middle line:90%
to do with it.

00:32:34.470 --> 00:32:35.330 align:middle line:90%
No, I'm done.

00:32:35.330 --> 00:32:36.130 align:middle line:90%
I'm good.

00:32:36.130 --> 00:32:37.140 align:middle line:90%
I'm done.

00:32:37.140 --> 00:32:38.910 align:middle line:90%
I don't-- mm-mm.

00:32:38.910 --> 00:32:42.600 align:middle line:84%
But, again, I just kind of
was in this expanded state,

00:32:42.600 --> 00:32:45.630 align:middle line:90%
and it just felt so nurturing.

00:32:45.630 --> 00:32:49.830 align:middle line:84%
And I was being
impressed upon with what

00:32:49.830 --> 00:32:52.690 align:middle line:84%
the capability could be
should I choose to come back.

00:32:52.690 --> 00:32:53.490 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Mm-hmm.

00:32:53.490 --> 00:32:55.350 align:middle line:84%
>> GRACE: So obviously,
I made the decision--

00:32:55.350 --> 00:32:56.700 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: You
made that decision.

00:32:56.700 --> 00:32:57.270 align:middle line:90%
>> GRACE: --to come back.

00:32:57.270 --> 00:32:59.520 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: And you went
through an awful detox period,

00:32:59.520 --> 00:33:01.560 align:middle line:84%
but angels talked
you through it.

00:33:01.560 --> 00:33:03.840 align:middle line:84%
They worked with you
all through the process.

00:33:03.840 --> 00:33:05.550 align:middle line:84%
That sounds like it
was very painful.

00:33:05.550 --> 00:33:06.000 align:middle line:90%
>> GRACE: Yes.

00:33:06.000 --> 00:33:07.375 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: So you
got through it.

00:33:07.375 --> 00:33:08.880 align:middle line:90%
You met a man named Dave.

00:33:08.880 --> 00:33:11.530 align:middle line:84%
And Dave was-- wasn't
he a firefighter?

00:33:11.530 --> 00:33:13.020 align:middle line:84%
>> GRACE: He was
a pro BMX biker.

00:33:13.020 --> 00:33:15.062 align:middle line:84%
This is where we get into
the whole skater scene.

00:33:15.062 --> 00:33:16.853 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: Yeah, then
you got into skater--

00:33:16.853 --> 00:33:19.350 align:middle line:84%
we don't have time to get
into all of the personal part,

00:33:19.350 --> 00:33:20.670 align:middle line:90%
but-- oh, he was the skater.

00:33:20.670 --> 00:33:21.210 align:middle line:90%
Right.

00:33:21.210 --> 00:33:22.010 align:middle line:90%
>> GRACE: Yeah.

00:33:22.010 --> 00:33:24.830 align:middle line:84%
We did the whole X Games
thing before, as it came on.

00:33:24.830 --> 00:33:25.630 align:middle line:90%
It was so fun.

00:33:25.630 --> 00:33:26.040 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Yeah.

00:33:26.040 --> 00:33:27.210 align:middle line:90%
And so you had some fun.

00:33:27.210 --> 00:33:27.540 align:middle line:90%
>> GRACE: Mm-hmm.

00:33:27.540 --> 00:33:29.000 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: You had a
lovely relationship.

00:33:29.000 --> 00:33:29.370 align:middle line:90%
>> GRACE: Mm-hmm.

00:33:29.370 --> 00:33:31.290 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: And then there was
a time for you to get serious,

00:33:31.290 --> 00:33:32.190 align:middle line:90%
and you knew it.

00:33:32.190 --> 00:33:32.990 align:middle line:90%
And life changed.

00:33:32.990 --> 00:33:33.948 align:middle line:90%
>> GRACE: Life changed.

00:33:33.948 --> 00:33:36.450 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: So then you end up--
and what I'm going to do is,

00:33:36.450 --> 00:33:39.340 align:middle line:84%
in your book, the way it's
laid out, you have your story.

00:33:39.340 --> 00:33:40.140 align:middle line:90%
And then boom.

00:33:40.140 --> 00:33:43.500 align:middle line:84%
In the middle, you'll have
a story of an EMT experience

00:33:43.500 --> 00:33:45.040 align:middle line:90%
where someone is dying.

00:33:45.040 --> 00:33:45.840 align:middle line:90%
>> GRACE: Yeah.

00:33:45.840 --> 00:33:48.340 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: So what I'm going
to do is take all those and put

00:33:48.340 --> 00:33:51.390 align:middle line:84%
them toward the end so we can
hear a stack of these stories

00:33:51.390 --> 00:33:52.380 align:middle line:90%
of these people--

00:33:52.380 --> 00:33:52.740 align:middle line:90%
>> GRACE: Cool.

00:33:52.740 --> 00:33:54.740 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: --and the
trends happening right now.

00:33:54.740 --> 00:33:56.850 align:middle line:84%
So we're going to kind of
jump through your life.

00:33:56.850 --> 00:33:59.083 align:middle line:84%
Then you met Dave,
who was a firefighter,

00:33:59.083 --> 00:34:00.000 align:middle line:90%
and you became an EMT.

00:34:00.000 --> 00:34:00.450 align:middle line:90%
Or was he an EMT?

00:34:00.450 --> 00:34:00.960 align:middle line:90%
>> GRACE: No.

00:34:00.960 --> 00:34:02.100 align:middle line:90%
That was when I was young.

00:34:02.100 --> 00:34:04.590 align:middle line:84%
But then we ultimately, we
ran around, had a good time.

00:34:04.590 --> 00:34:05.548 align:middle line:90%
But we were just young.

00:34:05.548 --> 00:34:06.348 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Yeah.

00:34:06.348 --> 00:34:07.950 align:middle line:84%
>> GRACE: And we
moved to California.

00:34:07.950 --> 00:34:08.250 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Yeah.

00:34:08.250 --> 00:34:10.110 align:middle line:84%
>> GRACE: And so once
I got into California,

00:34:10.110 --> 00:34:13.260 align:middle line:84%
then I started to
get more stabilized.

00:34:13.260 --> 00:34:15.510 align:middle line:84%
And Dave and I had split,
and I was on my own,

00:34:15.510 --> 00:34:17.100 align:middle line:84%
just trying to
figure it out in LA.

00:34:17.100 --> 00:34:17.370 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Oh, yeah.

00:34:17.370 --> 00:34:18.370 align:middle line:90%
I've got the name wrong.

00:34:18.370 --> 00:34:20.431 align:middle line:84%
What was the man
you met later on?

00:34:20.431 --> 00:34:21.389 align:middle line:90%
>> GRACE: My kid's dad.

00:34:21.389 --> 00:34:21.750 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Yes.

00:34:21.750 --> 00:34:22.064 align:middle line:90%
What was his name?

00:34:22.064 --> 00:34:23.159 align:middle line:84%
>> GRACE: In the
book, it's Derek.

00:34:23.159 --> 00:34:23.439 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Derek.

00:34:23.439 --> 00:34:23.580 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

00:34:23.580 --> 00:34:24.659 align:middle line:90%
>> GRACE: Yeah, for his privacy.

00:34:24.659 --> 00:34:25.290 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Yes, yes.

00:34:25.290 --> 00:34:26.190 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:34:26.190 --> 00:34:27.719 align:middle line:90%
>> GRACE: Um, yeah.

00:34:27.719 --> 00:34:30.750 align:middle line:84%
And so ultimately, I was
still kind of in a space

00:34:30.750 --> 00:34:33.917 align:middle line:84%
because I had gone from the
Midwest down at Florida.

00:34:33.917 --> 00:34:36.000 align:middle line:84%
And I had done some modeling,
some pinup modeling,

00:34:36.000 --> 00:34:39.000 align:middle line:84%
and kind of lived this, like,
wild lifestyle in my 20s.

00:34:39.000 --> 00:34:41.370 align:middle line:84%
And then I come
over to and then--

00:34:41.370 --> 00:34:42.900 align:middle line:90%
to California, and that ended.

00:34:42.900 --> 00:34:46.020 align:middle line:84%
So then I was in that
space of, now what do I do?

00:34:46.020 --> 00:34:47.760 align:middle line:90%
But my intuition kept pushing.

00:34:47.760 --> 00:34:50.169 align:middle line:84%
Every time an ambulance would
go by, it'd be like this.

00:34:50.169 --> 00:34:50.969 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Yes.

00:34:50.969 --> 00:34:53.340 align:middle line:84%
>> GRACE: But I was
so scared of it.

00:34:53.340 --> 00:34:54.330 align:middle line:90%
I was like, no way.

00:34:54.330 --> 00:34:55.497 align:middle line:90%
Like, I could kill somebody.

00:34:55.497 --> 00:34:57.663 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: You were having
it whispered in your ear?

00:34:57.663 --> 00:34:59.160 align:middle line:90%
This is what you need to do.

00:34:59.160 --> 00:35:00.810 align:middle line:84%
>> GRACE: It's never
stopped for me.

00:35:00.810 --> 00:35:04.860 align:middle line:84%
I would just try to tune it
out, doing different things.

00:35:04.860 --> 00:35:08.040 align:middle line:84%
But after my overdose, I
got myself quite cleaned up.

00:35:08.040 --> 00:35:11.700 align:middle line:84%
And during the time in
Florida, I got very clean.

00:35:11.700 --> 00:35:14.830 align:middle line:84%
And when I came to
California, ultimately,

00:35:14.830 --> 00:35:15.880 align:middle line:90%
I decided finally to--

00:35:15.880 --> 00:35:16.680 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:35:16.680 --> 00:35:19.260 align:middle line:84%
I went through the
UCLA EMT course.

00:35:19.260 --> 00:35:22.770 align:middle line:84%
And I got sent straight down
into South Central Los Angeles.

00:35:22.770 --> 00:35:24.030 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Yes, South Central.

00:35:24.030 --> 00:35:24.830 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:35:24.830 --> 00:35:27.390 align:middle line:84%
So let's talk about some
of those first experiences

00:35:27.390 --> 00:35:29.730 align:middle line:90%
on the job.

00:35:29.730 --> 00:35:31.890 align:middle line:84%
First, before you really
had yourself wide open.

00:35:31.890 --> 00:35:34.140 align:middle line:84%
But then we want to go into
the wide-open experiences.

00:35:34.140 --> 00:35:35.110 align:middle line:90%
>> GRACE: OK.

00:35:35.110 --> 00:35:37.740 align:middle line:84%
So the mechanics of a
911 call are intense.

00:35:37.740 --> 00:35:42.190 align:middle line:84%
And nobody initially just
tells you how it all works.

00:35:42.190 --> 00:35:43.840 align:middle line:84%
So the engineer
stays by the engine.

00:35:43.840 --> 00:35:45.090 align:middle line:90%
The captain has the clipboard.

00:35:45.090 --> 00:35:46.632 align:middle line:84%
The EMT is taking
the blood pressure.

00:35:46.632 --> 00:35:49.710 align:middle line:84%
My job is to start the IV
and deliver the medications.

00:35:49.710 --> 00:35:51.570 align:middle line:84%
But nobody tells
you that, so you

00:35:51.570 --> 00:35:55.120 align:middle line:84%
have to learn kind of the
cadence of the 911 call.

00:35:55.120 --> 00:35:55.920 align:middle line:90%
Right?

00:35:55.920 --> 00:35:59.700 align:middle line:84%
And so I spent the first six
months just learning the basic.

00:35:59.700 --> 00:36:03.810 align:middle line:84%
And my guides, I think, took the
stimulus and kind of shelved it

00:36:03.810 --> 00:36:04.690 align:middle line:90%
for just a second.

00:36:04.690 --> 00:36:05.535 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: So you
could do your job.

00:36:05.535 --> 00:36:07.440 align:middle line:84%
>> GRACE: Because it was
so high-octane anyway.

00:36:07.440 --> 00:36:08.240 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Yeah.

00:36:08.240 --> 00:36:10.710 align:middle line:84%
>> GRACE: We were
working 24-hour shifts,

00:36:10.710 --> 00:36:14.770 align:middle line:84%
and we would run anywhere from
20 to 24 calls in that time.

00:36:14.770 --> 00:36:15.690 align:middle line:90%
So there's no rest.

00:36:15.690 --> 00:36:16.800 align:middle line:90%
There's no stopping.

00:36:16.800 --> 00:36:18.360 align:middle line:90%
There's no eat lunch breaks.

00:36:18.360 --> 00:36:21.150 align:middle line:84%
You're just back to
back to back calls.

00:36:21.150 --> 00:36:24.570 align:middle line:90%
And this was in early 2000s.

00:36:24.570 --> 00:36:27.160 align:middle line:84%
It was quite volatile
down in that area.

00:36:27.160 --> 00:36:29.850 align:middle line:84%
And so we were having
a lot of gang shootings

00:36:29.850 --> 00:36:31.080 align:middle line:90%
and a lot of drive-bys.

00:36:31.080 --> 00:36:34.770 align:middle line:84%
And then there was
just a lot to navigate.

00:36:34.770 --> 00:36:38.700 align:middle line:84%
But ultimately, I got
pretty proficient on scene,

00:36:38.700 --> 00:36:41.700 align:middle line:84%
and that's when the
energy started to come in.

00:36:41.700 --> 00:36:43.950 align:middle line:84%
And man, I was so mad
because I had finally kind of

00:36:43.950 --> 00:36:44.750 align:middle line:90%
had a break.

00:36:44.750 --> 00:36:45.900 align:middle line:90%
And I was like, yeah!

00:36:45.900 --> 00:36:47.070 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: I got a real job.

00:36:47.070 --> 00:36:47.870 align:middle line:90%
>> GRACE: Yeah.

00:36:47.870 --> 00:36:49.450 align:middle line:90%
I've grown out of it.

00:36:49.450 --> 00:36:52.110 align:middle line:84%
Little did I know that my guys
were going to be like, oh yeah?

00:36:52.110 --> 00:36:54.550 align:middle line:84%
And then just put
the energy through.

00:36:54.550 --> 00:36:57.240 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: So now let's start
talking about once the energy

00:36:57.240 --> 00:36:58.290 align:middle line:90%
starts coming through.

00:36:58.290 --> 00:37:00.060 align:middle line:84%
And we'll bring up a
few cases because I

00:37:00.060 --> 00:37:03.160 align:middle line:84%
want to get to what you're
seeing today in today's world.

00:37:03.160 --> 00:37:06.480 align:middle line:84%
So there was a fellow named
Jason who had hung himself.

00:37:06.480 --> 00:37:07.510 align:middle line:90%
Let's talk about that.

00:37:07.510 --> 00:37:09.510 align:middle line:90%
So we're talking about--

00:37:09.510 --> 00:37:10.500 align:middle line:90%
how old was he?

00:37:10.500 --> 00:37:11.520 align:middle line:90%
>> GRACE: I believe 17.

00:37:11.520 --> 00:37:12.320 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: 17.

00:37:12.320 --> 00:37:14.100 align:middle line:84%
A young man who was
committing suicide.

00:37:14.100 --> 00:37:16.810 align:middle line:84%
But there was this whole
dance with karma waiting.

00:37:16.810 --> 00:37:17.610 align:middle line:90%
>> GRACE: Yes.

00:37:17.610 --> 00:37:22.230 align:middle line:84%
So suicide is an
interesting thing.

00:37:22.230 --> 00:37:24.360 align:middle line:84%
We were talking about
we have multiple choice

00:37:24.360 --> 00:37:27.570 align:middle line:84%
points of opting out of this
incarnation or life experience.

00:37:27.570 --> 00:37:29.310 align:middle line:84%
And sometimes it
just gets so heavy.

00:37:29.310 --> 00:37:32.152 align:middle line:84%
I mean, we've been living
in tremendous heaviness

00:37:32.152 --> 00:37:33.360 align:middle line:90%
for the last couple of years.

00:37:33.360 --> 00:37:35.560 align:middle line:84%
And there's a lot of stuff
that we're seeing now.

00:37:35.560 --> 00:37:38.760 align:middle line:84%
But this, we went in, and he
was in full rigor mortis, which

00:37:38.760 --> 00:37:40.710 align:middle line:84%
means the body is stiff,
so he had been dead

00:37:40.710 --> 00:37:42.120 align:middle line:90%
for quite a while.

00:37:42.120 --> 00:37:45.930 align:middle line:84%
And he had hung
himself from the door.

00:37:45.930 --> 00:37:48.450 align:middle line:84%
But walking into his
room, it was so surreal

00:37:48.450 --> 00:37:50.850 align:middle line:90%
because his computers were on.

00:37:50.850 --> 00:37:52.110 align:middle line:90%
His music was playing.

00:37:52.110 --> 00:37:53.543 align:middle line:90%
There's a bag of Cheetos there.

00:37:53.543 --> 00:37:54.960 align:middle line:84%
He had a notebook
with some stuff.

00:37:54.960 --> 00:37:57.570 align:middle line:84%
Literally, just like got out
of the room and like, I'm out.

00:37:57.570 --> 00:37:57.810 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Yeah.

00:37:57.810 --> 00:37:58.610 align:middle line:90%
>> GRACE: Right?

00:37:58.610 --> 00:38:01.770 align:middle line:90%
And it's so strange to see that.

00:38:01.770 --> 00:38:06.690 align:middle line:84%
And from a soul perspective
though-- so his dad called,

00:38:06.690 --> 00:38:08.160 align:middle line:90%
and his dad was hysterical.

00:38:08.160 --> 00:38:10.990 align:middle line:84%
So we were having to care
take and navigate his dad.

00:38:10.990 --> 00:38:12.990 align:middle line:84%
We have to cut the body
down and deal with that,

00:38:12.990 --> 00:38:14.710 align:middle line:90%
get the coroner on the way.

00:38:14.710 --> 00:38:18.420 align:middle line:84%
And then I could see his soul,
and he was so remorseful.

00:38:18.420 --> 00:38:22.800 align:middle line:84%
And he was in what
appeared to be some room.

00:38:22.800 --> 00:38:25.320 align:middle line:84%
It just looked kind of almost
like a study or an office.

00:38:25.320 --> 00:38:28.530 align:middle line:84%
And there seemed to be a guide,
a male guide there with him.

00:38:28.530 --> 00:38:30.690 align:middle line:84%
But his head was in
his hands, and he just

00:38:30.690 --> 00:38:33.540 align:middle line:84%
seemed to be very, very
upset and remorseful

00:38:33.540 --> 00:38:35.140 align:middle line:90%
about the whole experience.

00:38:35.140 --> 00:38:38.500 align:middle line:84%
And so I think that was
one of my first suicides.

00:38:38.500 --> 00:38:40.080 align:middle line:90%
And so that was a lot.

00:38:40.080 --> 00:38:43.770 align:middle line:84%
And again, I didn't have a
real handle on my energetics.

00:38:43.770 --> 00:38:46.050 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: It wasn't just
surrounded by angels,

00:38:46.050 --> 00:38:47.490 align:middle line:90%
whisking a person off.

00:38:47.490 --> 00:38:50.130 align:middle line:84%
It was sounds like it was a
little more contemplative,

00:38:50.130 --> 00:38:52.290 align:middle line:84%
and there was still some
negotiation going on.

00:38:52.290 --> 00:38:52.710 align:middle line:90%
>> GRACE: Yes.

00:38:52.710 --> 00:38:54.180 align:middle line:84%
And my understanding
with that is

00:38:54.180 --> 00:38:56.040 align:middle line:84%
that there can,
in some instance,

00:38:56.040 --> 00:38:58.092 align:middle line:90%
can be a karmic balancing.

00:38:58.092 --> 00:38:59.550 align:middle line:84%
There's almost like
a contract that

00:38:59.550 --> 00:39:03.480 align:middle line:84%
has to be completed before
the soul can ultimately cross

00:39:03.480 --> 00:39:05.410 align:middle line:90%
and transition.

00:39:05.410 --> 00:39:08.130 align:middle line:84%
But my understanding
now, after seeing

00:39:08.130 --> 00:39:12.330 align:middle line:84%
this for many, many years
and seeing countless people's

00:39:12.330 --> 00:39:15.340 align:middle line:84%
transitions, is that
ultimately, the souls cross.

00:39:15.340 --> 00:39:16.140 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Yes.

00:39:16.140 --> 00:39:17.310 align:middle line:84%
>> GRACE: So there's
no soul left behind.

00:39:17.310 --> 00:39:19.440 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: Yeah, there's
no purgatory, so to speak.

00:39:19.440 --> 00:39:19.800 align:middle line:90%
>> GRACE: Yeah.

00:39:19.800 --> 00:39:22.170 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: OK, let's go to
Rudy and the heart attack.

00:39:22.170 --> 00:39:22.710 align:middle line:90%
>> GRACE: OK.

00:39:22.710 --> 00:39:23.520 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: OK?

00:39:23.520 --> 00:39:24.395 align:middle line:90%
>> GRACE: Oh my gosh.

00:39:24.395 --> 00:39:27.190 align:middle line:90%


00:39:27.190 --> 00:39:30.088 align:middle line:90%
There's so many cases.

00:39:30.088 --> 00:39:32.380 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: I just cherry
picked a few because I knew we

00:39:32.380 --> 00:39:34.150 align:middle line:84%
couldn't-- people
can read the book.

00:39:34.150 --> 00:39:36.540 align:middle line:90%
We can't go into all of them.

00:39:36.540 --> 00:39:37.340 align:middle line:90%
>> GRACE: OK.

00:39:37.340 --> 00:39:39.870 align:middle line:84%
So the heart attack, we've
got two that are coming.

00:39:39.870 --> 00:39:40.670 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Mm-hmm.

00:39:40.670 --> 00:39:41.840 align:middle line:84%
>> GRACE: Because
I have got so many.

00:39:41.840 --> 00:39:42.180 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Sure.

00:39:42.180 --> 00:39:43.190 align:middle line:84%
>> GRACE: It's like
a Rolodex of calls.

00:39:43.190 --> 00:39:43.430 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Yeah.

00:39:43.430 --> 00:39:44.460 align:middle line:90%
You go for it.

00:39:44.460 --> 00:39:48.440 align:middle line:84%
>> GRACE: So one of my first
experiences with death was

00:39:48.440 --> 00:39:50.858 align:middle line:84%
quite incredible because
he had had chest pain.

00:39:50.858 --> 00:39:52.400 align:middle line:84%
We got there to
treat the chest pain.

00:39:52.400 --> 00:39:54.680 align:middle line:84%
We were transporting
into the hospital.

00:39:54.680 --> 00:39:57.920 align:middle line:84%
And he turned all the way
around to where I was sitting.

00:39:57.920 --> 00:39:59.480 align:middle line:84%
And he looked me
directly in the eyes

00:39:59.480 --> 00:40:02.820 align:middle line:84%
and said, I'm going to
die today, aren't I?

00:40:02.820 --> 00:40:04.730 align:middle line:84%
And this is right
when I was new,

00:40:04.730 --> 00:40:07.310 align:middle line:84%
and I didn't know how
to respond to that.

00:40:07.310 --> 00:40:09.982 align:middle line:84%
And that was really
shocking because I was like,

00:40:09.982 --> 00:40:11.940 align:middle line:84%
oh, no, we're going to
get you to the hospital.

00:40:11.940 --> 00:40:12.740 align:middle line:90%
We're going to.

00:40:12.740 --> 00:40:13.700 align:middle line:90%
But he knew.

00:40:13.700 --> 00:40:14.780 align:middle line:90%
He knew it was his time.

00:40:14.780 --> 00:40:16.400 align:middle line:90%
We got him into the hospital.

00:40:16.400 --> 00:40:19.220 align:middle line:90%
We got him onto the ER bed.

00:40:19.220 --> 00:40:21.170 align:middle line:90%
And he coded, he flatlined.

00:40:21.170 --> 00:40:23.720 align:middle line:84%
And so that was an
interesting experience for me

00:40:23.720 --> 00:40:28.020 align:middle line:84%
to start to learn
how to ride that edge

00:40:28.020 --> 00:40:30.960 align:middle line:84%
and what to say to the
people as they were alive

00:40:30.960 --> 00:40:35.525 align:middle line:84%
and then actively beginning
to watch them transition.

00:40:35.525 --> 00:40:37.400 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: So after he
transitioned or during

00:40:37.400 --> 00:40:40.430 align:middle line:84%
the transition, though,
he was peaceful with it?

00:40:40.430 --> 00:40:41.930 align:middle line:90%
He understood this was his time?

00:40:41.930 --> 00:40:42.440 align:middle line:90%
>> GRACE: Yes.

00:40:42.440 --> 00:40:43.815 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: And
what is that like?

00:40:43.815 --> 00:40:46.400 align:middle line:84%
What is that kind of
transition like to watch?

00:40:46.400 --> 00:40:48.770 align:middle line:84%
>> GRACE: So in a medical--
so this is really neat

00:40:48.770 --> 00:40:53.720 align:middle line:84%
because ultimately, I got to
a level of proficiency with

00:40:53.720 --> 00:40:54.920 align:middle line:90%
the energetics on scene.

00:40:54.920 --> 00:40:57.030 align:middle line:84%
So my experience-- let
me share my experience,

00:40:57.030 --> 00:41:00.020 align:middle line:84%
and then I'll share how I
kind of learned the protocols.

00:41:00.020 --> 00:41:02.450 align:middle line:84%
My experience was
very matrix-like.

00:41:02.450 --> 00:41:04.280 align:middle line:90%
I would arrive on scene.

00:41:04.280 --> 00:41:07.220 align:middle line:84%
Any time death was near,
I would taste metal.

00:41:07.220 --> 00:41:09.210 align:middle line:84%
That's always my tell,
still to this day.

00:41:09.210 --> 00:41:10.010 align:middle line:90%
OK?

00:41:10.010 --> 00:41:11.540 align:middle line:84%
I'll just know that
somebody right around me

00:41:11.540 --> 00:41:12.620 align:middle line:90%
is going to die.

00:41:12.620 --> 00:41:14.070 align:middle line:90%
I'll expand out.

00:41:14.070 --> 00:41:16.310 align:middle line:84%
And so then it
feels like I don't

00:41:16.310 --> 00:41:18.920 align:middle line:84%
know where the end of
my skin and the energies

00:41:18.920 --> 00:41:19.910 align:middle line:90%
of the universe begin.

00:41:19.910 --> 00:41:23.780 align:middle line:84%
So I just kind of expand,
and everything slows down

00:41:23.780 --> 00:41:25.490 align:middle line:90%
and becomes very crystalline.

00:41:25.490 --> 00:41:28.580 align:middle line:84%
At that point,
then I can sense, I

00:41:28.580 --> 00:41:32.610 align:middle line:84%
can hear, audible, everything
that's happening on scene.

00:41:32.610 --> 00:41:34.520 align:middle line:90%
And again, so it's very matrix.

00:41:34.520 --> 00:41:38.390 align:middle line:84%
And whether it is just a
knowing or whether it's

00:41:38.390 --> 00:41:40.670 align:middle line:84%
a short snippet like
a video, I would just

00:41:40.670 --> 00:41:42.230 align:middle line:84%
get a video clip
of what was going

00:41:42.230 --> 00:41:44.810 align:middle line:84%
to happen just
before it did, which

00:41:44.810 --> 00:41:47.630 align:middle line:84%
helped me navigate the
energetics of the scene.

00:41:47.630 --> 00:41:50.390 align:middle line:84%
So that was my
experience on a 911 call

00:41:50.390 --> 00:41:53.250 align:middle line:84%
in addition to dealing with
and caretaking the bodies.

00:41:53.250 --> 00:41:54.050 align:middle line:90%
OK?

00:41:54.050 --> 00:41:54.850 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Right.

00:41:54.850 --> 00:41:59.150 align:middle line:84%
>> GRACE: So I finally,
as a paramedic,

00:41:59.150 --> 00:42:01.350 align:middle line:90%
felt like I belonged somewhere.

00:42:01.350 --> 00:42:02.390 align:middle line:90%
I finally fit in.

00:42:02.390 --> 00:42:04.490 align:middle line:84%
And this was finally
socially accepted.

00:42:04.490 --> 00:42:05.290 align:middle line:90%
Right?

00:42:05.290 --> 00:42:07.020 align:middle line:90%
I had a little bit of esteem.

00:42:07.020 --> 00:42:09.000 align:middle line:90%
And this is a very alpha field.

00:42:09.000 --> 00:42:09.800 align:middle line:90%
Right?

00:42:09.800 --> 00:42:10.600 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Yes.

00:42:10.600 --> 00:42:13.850 align:middle line:84%
>> GRACE: So very alpha,
very masculine, very type A.

00:42:13.850 --> 00:42:17.030 align:middle line:84%
We are a different breed because
we are the type of people--

00:42:17.030 --> 00:42:20.760 align:middle line:84%
we are the ones running towards
what everybody else is running

00:42:20.760 --> 00:42:21.560 align:middle line:90%
away from.

00:42:21.560 --> 00:42:21.830 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Yes.

00:42:21.830 --> 00:42:22.630 align:middle line:90%
>> GRACE: Right?

00:42:22.630 --> 00:42:29.010 align:middle line:84%
And so my-- the severity of
violence that I grew up with,

00:42:29.010 --> 00:42:30.845 align:middle line:90%
I was like a duck to water.

00:42:30.845 --> 00:42:32.220 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: It was
familiar water.

00:42:32.220 --> 00:42:33.790 align:middle line:84%
>> GRACE: It was
so familiar to me.

00:42:33.790 --> 00:42:34.590 align:middle line:90%
Right?

00:42:34.590 --> 00:42:37.470 align:middle line:84%
And so that was kind
of my experience.

00:42:37.470 --> 00:42:41.130 align:middle line:84%
And then I gained in
proficiency as a paramedic

00:42:41.130 --> 00:42:42.510 align:middle line:90%
in the skill set.

00:42:42.510 --> 00:42:45.840 align:middle line:84%
And I started to just notice
that these energies would just

00:42:45.840 --> 00:42:47.190 align:middle line:90%
come through my hands.

00:42:47.190 --> 00:42:49.740 align:middle line:84%
And it would just be like
a warm, loving touch,

00:42:49.740 --> 00:42:51.990 align:middle line:84%
and I would just intuitively
know exactly what

00:42:51.990 --> 00:42:53.740 align:middle line:90%
that person needed to hear.

00:42:53.740 --> 00:42:56.940 align:middle line:84%
And I would start to relay
messages from a higher--

00:42:56.940 --> 00:42:58.770 align:middle line:84%
now I understand
it was channeling.

00:42:58.770 --> 00:42:59.570 align:middle line:90%
Right?

00:42:59.570 --> 00:43:00.900 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Yes.

00:43:00.900 --> 00:43:04.380 align:middle line:84%
>> GRACE: And sometimes energies
would come over the top of me

00:43:04.380 --> 00:43:07.260 align:middle line:84%
if something needed to
be stabilized on scene.

00:43:07.260 --> 00:43:08.670 align:middle line:90%
I would just navigate.

00:43:08.670 --> 00:43:11.040 align:middle line:84%
So there's different
types of death.

00:43:11.040 --> 00:43:12.340 align:middle line:90%
Here's one thing to understand.

00:43:12.340 --> 00:43:13.140 align:middle line:90%
OK?

00:43:13.140 --> 00:43:16.350 align:middle line:84%
There's as many ways to
die as there are to live.

00:43:16.350 --> 00:43:17.190 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Yeah.

00:43:17.190 --> 00:43:20.530 align:middle line:84%
>> GRACE: And there's
nothing to fear in death.

00:43:20.530 --> 00:43:22.290 align:middle line:84%
It's like taking
off a heavy coat.

00:43:22.290 --> 00:43:23.160 align:middle line:90%
OK?

00:43:23.160 --> 00:43:26.790 align:middle line:84%
And in the medical death
or an expected death,

00:43:26.790 --> 00:43:30.360 align:middle line:84%
say we have somebody with
end-stage cancer, or hospice,

00:43:30.360 --> 00:43:32.850 align:middle line:84%
or whatever, their
body would be in bed.

00:43:32.850 --> 00:43:35.520 align:middle line:84%
And over time, their
auric field begins

00:43:35.520 --> 00:43:38.700 align:middle line:84%
to expand outwardly,
and their veil thins.

00:43:38.700 --> 00:43:41.610 align:middle line:84%
And so we hear all the time in
the near-death experiences that

00:43:41.610 --> 00:43:43.590 align:middle line:90%
those people are talking to--

00:43:43.590 --> 00:43:45.750 align:middle line:84%
they're seeing their
dead loved ones

00:43:45.750 --> 00:43:49.030 align:middle line:84%
and doing some astral
traveling and stuff like that.

00:43:49.030 --> 00:43:53.710 align:middle line:84%
Well, at the moment of death,
in the actual cardiac arrest,

00:43:53.710 --> 00:43:57.120 align:middle line:84%
which is when they go agonal
and the heart quits beating--

00:43:57.120 --> 00:43:59.730 align:middle line:84%
this is so beautiful
to watch too

00:43:59.730 --> 00:44:03.300 align:middle line:84%
because it's this really
organized energetic.

00:44:03.300 --> 00:44:05.430 align:middle line:90%
It looks like ribbons unfurling.

00:44:05.430 --> 00:44:08.040 align:middle line:84%
And it starts at the base
down at the tailbone,

00:44:08.040 --> 00:44:09.995 align:middle line:84%
and it unfurls like
a ribbon all the way

00:44:09.995 --> 00:44:11.370 align:middle line:84%
up the vertebral
column, and then

00:44:11.370 --> 00:44:14.340 align:middle line:84%
the soul would exit out
the crown of the head.

00:44:14.340 --> 00:44:18.960 align:middle line:84%
And that, I came to
understand, is the light

00:44:18.960 --> 00:44:21.030 align:middle line:84%
at the end of the
tunnel experiences

00:44:21.030 --> 00:44:23.950 align:middle line:84%
so many people have is their
consciousness going out

00:44:23.950 --> 00:44:24.750 align:middle line:90%
the crown.

00:44:24.750 --> 00:44:25.740 align:middle line:90%
I thought that was so cool.

00:44:25.740 --> 00:44:26.160 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Yeah.

00:44:26.160 --> 00:44:28.080 align:middle line:84%
>> GRACE: And then
the soul would exit,

00:44:28.080 --> 00:44:31.650 align:middle line:84%
and I would see
deceased loved ones,

00:44:31.650 --> 00:44:33.630 align:middle line:84%
some religious
archetypes sometimes,

00:44:33.630 --> 00:44:36.000 align:middle line:84%
depending on the person's
belief structure,

00:44:36.000 --> 00:44:38.920 align:middle line:90%
and their pets that had passed.

00:44:38.920 --> 00:44:41.460 align:middle line:84%
So it became kind
of this reunion.

00:44:41.460 --> 00:44:43.110 align:middle line:84%
And I would watch
over here, they're

00:44:43.110 --> 00:44:46.290 align:middle line:84%
floating in the corner of the
room or doing CPR on the body.

00:44:46.290 --> 00:44:49.890 align:middle line:84%
Or if it's a DNR,
announcing time of death,

00:44:49.890 --> 00:44:52.650 align:middle line:84%
printing out, all the
things that we have to do.

00:44:52.650 --> 00:44:54.960 align:middle line:84%
But I'd be watching
in the corner almost

00:44:54.960 --> 00:44:56.820 align:middle line:90%
this joyous reunion.

00:44:56.820 --> 00:44:58.990 align:middle line:84%
And then they would
just disappear, right?

00:44:58.990 --> 00:44:59.790 align:middle line:90%
From view.

00:44:59.790 --> 00:45:00.837 align:middle line:90%
It was just incredible.

00:45:00.837 --> 00:45:01.920 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Very beautiful.

00:45:01.920 --> 00:45:02.800 align:middle line:90%
>> GRACE: To watch.

00:45:02.800 --> 00:45:05.370 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: And when people pass
traumatically-- for example,

00:45:05.370 --> 00:45:10.350 align:middle line:84%
car accidents-- it's like
with Taylor, what happened?

00:45:10.350 --> 00:45:13.075 align:middle line:84%
And then they're surrounded
by angelic forces.

00:45:13.075 --> 00:45:14.700 align:middle line:84%
>> GRACE: Yeah, it's
a very different--

00:45:14.700 --> 00:45:18.000 align:middle line:84%
it's a very different way to die
as far as what the individual

00:45:18.000 --> 00:45:19.230 align:middle line:90%
experiences.

00:45:19.230 --> 00:45:21.075 align:middle line:84%
Again, ultimately,
nothing to fear.

00:45:21.075 --> 00:45:21.330 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Yeah.

00:45:21.330 --> 00:45:22.130 align:middle line:90%
>> GRACE: OK?

00:45:22.130 --> 00:45:26.430 align:middle line:84%
People, I think, are-- our
society is death-phobic.

00:45:26.430 --> 00:45:30.300 align:middle line:84%
And we kind of try to
hide it away in bubble

00:45:30.300 --> 00:45:32.250 align:middle line:84%
wrap ourselves
for the inevitable

00:45:32.250 --> 00:45:36.750 align:middle line:84%
when we can start to just take
the fear away and understand

00:45:36.750 --> 00:45:39.340 align:middle line:84%
that it's a very
natural part of life.

00:45:39.340 --> 00:45:40.140 align:middle line:90%
Right?

00:45:40.140 --> 00:45:44.190 align:middle line:84%
And even in a traumatic
death, there may be pain,

00:45:44.190 --> 00:45:45.880 align:middle line:90%
but it's just for a moment.

00:45:45.880 --> 00:45:46.680 align:middle line:90%
OK?

00:45:46.680 --> 00:45:49.078 align:middle line:84%
I think that a lot of people
fear the pain or fear the--

00:45:49.078 --> 00:45:51.120 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: But they're
out of their body so fast.

00:45:51.120 --> 00:45:52.780 align:middle line:84%
>> GRACE: In a
trauma, it's like--

00:45:52.780 --> 00:45:54.090 align:middle line:90%
OK, so here's the deal.

00:45:54.090 --> 00:45:56.190 align:middle line:84%
You're driving,
you're going to work.

00:45:56.190 --> 00:45:58.800 align:middle line:84%
And this is the thing
because everybody

00:45:58.800 --> 00:46:02.410 align:middle line:84%
or there are so many people
that we all think we have time.

00:46:02.410 --> 00:46:03.210 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Yeah.

00:46:03.210 --> 00:46:03.570 align:middle line:90%
>> GRACE: Right?

00:46:03.570 --> 00:46:05.010 align:middle line:84%
We're all, oh yeah,
I'll do it later.

00:46:05.010 --> 00:46:05.810 align:middle line:90%
I'll get there.

00:46:05.810 --> 00:46:07.110 align:middle line:90%
Yeah, whatever.

00:46:07.110 --> 00:46:09.900 align:middle line:84%
So many people every single
day die traumatically

00:46:09.900 --> 00:46:13.230 align:middle line:84%
and didn't have any idea
that it was their final day.

00:46:13.230 --> 00:46:15.900 align:middle line:84%
And I cannot tell you how
many times I've seen it.

00:46:15.900 --> 00:46:17.293 align:middle line:90%
Like, they're going to work.

00:46:17.293 --> 00:46:18.960 align:middle line:84%
They go through
Starbucks drive-through.

00:46:18.960 --> 00:46:19.770 align:middle line:90%
They're pulling out.

00:46:19.770 --> 00:46:20.570 align:middle line:90%
They're texting.

00:46:20.570 --> 00:46:23.370 align:middle line:84%
And they get on the
car-- on the freeway,

00:46:23.370 --> 00:46:25.050 align:middle line:84%
and there's a
rollover or whatever.

00:46:25.050 --> 00:46:26.390 align:middle line:90%
And that's it.

00:46:26.390 --> 00:46:27.190 align:middle line:90%
OK?

00:46:27.190 --> 00:46:31.080 align:middle line:84%
And so where the medical death
has this really beautiful, kind

00:46:31.080 --> 00:46:35.130 align:middle line:84%
of expanded, there's a bit of
time to it, some acclimation.

00:46:35.130 --> 00:46:36.720 align:middle line:90%
This is you're your body.

00:46:36.720 --> 00:46:38.040 align:middle line:90%
Nope, you're out of your body.

00:46:38.040 --> 00:46:38.840 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Yeah.

00:46:38.840 --> 00:46:42.180 align:middle line:84%
>> GRACE: And so the
soul would be confused.

00:46:42.180 --> 00:46:45.540 align:middle line:84%
And so we would come up, say
if it's a drive-by shooting,

00:46:45.540 --> 00:46:46.920 align:middle line:84%
and there's a body
on the ground,

00:46:46.920 --> 00:46:50.100 align:middle line:84%
I would see the soul
standing above the body.

00:46:50.100 --> 00:46:53.460 align:middle line:84%
And the soul, to me, looked just
like the person did except I

00:46:53.460 --> 00:46:54.900 align:middle line:90%
could see through them.

00:46:54.900 --> 00:46:57.300 align:middle line:84%
But they would be looking
down at their body,

00:46:57.300 --> 00:46:58.290 align:middle line:90%
like, super confused.

00:46:58.290 --> 00:47:00.553 align:middle line:84%
Like, Taylor was
really confused, right?

00:47:00.553 --> 00:47:02.970 align:middle line:84%
When we're in that space because
it's like, wait a second,

00:47:02.970 --> 00:47:04.020 align:middle line:90%
I was just there.

00:47:04.020 --> 00:47:05.530 align:middle line:90%
What's happening?

00:47:05.530 --> 00:47:11.250 align:middle line:84%
So the souls would be able
to tell that I could see them

00:47:11.250 --> 00:47:12.870 align:middle line:90%
through my clairvoyant vision.

00:47:12.870 --> 00:47:16.890 align:middle line:84%
And I think it's in the
same way that spirits can

00:47:16.890 --> 00:47:19.650 align:middle line:90%
tell when mediums can channel.

00:47:19.650 --> 00:47:21.810 align:middle line:90%
And so I would see them.

00:47:21.810 --> 00:47:23.440 align:middle line:84%
They would see that
I could see them.

00:47:23.440 --> 00:47:25.470 align:middle line:84%
And then over time, I
developed a protocol

00:47:25.470 --> 00:47:26.710 align:middle line:90%
to start kind of explaining.

00:47:26.710 --> 00:47:27.510 align:middle line:90%
OK?

00:47:27.510 --> 00:47:28.870 align:middle line:90%
You were just in a car accident.

00:47:28.870 --> 00:47:30.690 align:middle line:84%
And this is telepathic
and not verbal.

00:47:30.690 --> 00:47:32.113 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Right.

00:47:32.113 --> 00:47:34.030 align:middle line:84%
>> GRACE: Communicating
this is what happened,

00:47:34.030 --> 00:47:36.363 align:middle line:84%
this is what we're going to
do, we're going to transport

00:47:36.363 --> 00:47:37.600 align:middle line:90%
your body, et cetera.

00:47:37.600 --> 00:47:40.900 align:middle line:84%
But 9 times out of
10 on a trauma call,

00:47:40.900 --> 00:47:44.530 align:middle line:84%
the difference would be
that angels would come.

00:47:44.530 --> 00:47:46.600 align:middle line:84%
And I think--
because some people

00:47:46.600 --> 00:47:49.520 align:middle line:84%
would be like, well, aren't the
dead loved ones going to come?

00:47:49.520 --> 00:47:53.650 align:middle line:84%
And I think that because
there was so much volatility

00:47:53.650 --> 00:47:58.030 align:middle line:84%
on scene, it's the
sheer frequency of chaos

00:47:58.030 --> 00:48:01.540 align:middle line:84%
that the soul has to be
able to come into a space

00:48:01.540 --> 00:48:05.663 align:middle line:84%
where they can start to
accept before they can shift.

00:48:05.663 --> 00:48:06.580 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Absolutely.

00:48:06.580 --> 00:48:08.740 align:middle line:84%
>> GRACE: And so I think that
the angels were there to just

00:48:08.740 --> 00:48:09.280 align:middle line:90%
help.

00:48:09.280 --> 00:48:10.270 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: Yeah,
that's very beautiful.

00:48:10.270 --> 00:48:11.020 align:middle line:90%
>> GRACE: Incredible to witness.

00:48:11.020 --> 00:48:12.270 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: No, it's beautiful.

00:48:12.270 --> 00:48:14.830 align:middle line:84%
Even explaining it, we
can all see the grace

00:48:14.830 --> 00:48:17.110 align:middle line:90%
in that, the grace and that.

00:48:17.110 --> 00:48:20.190 align:middle line:84%
OK, this is the little
question I want to throw in.

00:48:20.190 --> 00:48:22.620 align:middle line:84%
Have you ever gotten
a call where someone

00:48:22.620 --> 00:48:24.400 align:middle line:90%
was ready to give birth?

00:48:24.400 --> 00:48:25.200 align:middle line:90%
>> GRACE: Oh, yeah.

00:48:25.200 --> 00:48:27.450 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: And so have you ever
seen what happens with the soul

00:48:27.450 --> 00:48:28.630 align:middle line:90%
during the birth process?

00:48:28.630 --> 00:48:28.920 align:middle line:90%
>> GRACE: Oh, yeah.

00:48:28.920 --> 00:48:29.610 align:middle line:90%
That's so cool.

00:48:29.610 --> 00:48:30.450 align:middle line:90%
Yeah, great question.

00:48:30.450 --> 00:48:30.690 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Yeah.

00:48:30.690 --> 00:48:32.357 align:middle line:84%
>> GRACE: One of my
coolest shifts ever,

00:48:32.357 --> 00:48:34.290 align:middle line:84%
I had a birth and a
death that same day.

00:48:34.290 --> 00:48:35.090 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Wow.

00:48:35.090 --> 00:48:38.580 align:middle line:84%
>> GRACE: And I was singing
"The Lion King, Circle of Life"

00:48:38.580 --> 00:48:40.440 align:middle line:90%
because that's pretty rare.

00:48:40.440 --> 00:48:42.827 align:middle line:84%
That was the only
time in 15 years

00:48:42.827 --> 00:48:44.160 align:middle line:90%
that that happened, but what a--

00:48:44.160 --> 00:48:46.710 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: So just briefly let
us know what it looks like when

00:48:46.710 --> 00:48:47.510 align:middle line:90%
the birth--

00:48:47.510 --> 00:48:50.010 align:middle line:84%
>> GRACE: OK, a lot
of angelic frequency,

00:48:50.010 --> 00:48:53.515 align:middle line:84%
a lot of powder pink energy
usually surrounding the moms

00:48:53.515 --> 00:48:55.140 align:middle line:84%
going through what
she's going through.

00:48:55.140 --> 00:48:56.568 align:middle line:90%
Pain has its own energy.

00:48:56.568 --> 00:48:59.110 align:middle line:84%
It's not dark when you're going
through the birthing process,

00:48:59.110 --> 00:49:02.340 align:middle line:84%
but pain is more vibrant
colors going through the body.

00:49:02.340 --> 00:49:06.000 align:middle line:84%
But through the canal,
and as the baby enters,

00:49:06.000 --> 00:49:08.970 align:middle line:84%
powder pinks and just
celestial angels.

00:49:08.970 --> 00:49:13.050 align:middle line:84%
So they're courted,
energetically courted from--

00:49:13.050 --> 00:49:15.840 align:middle line:84%
I mean, it's just a
few weeks of inception,

00:49:15.840 --> 00:49:19.630 align:middle line:84%
but they're not really
committed here until they're

00:49:19.630 --> 00:49:20.430 align:middle line:90%
delivered through.

00:49:20.430 --> 00:49:20.790 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: Passed
through the birth canal.

00:49:20.790 --> 00:49:23.590 align:middle line:84%
>> GRACE: And then they
still have an opt-out year,

00:49:23.590 --> 00:49:25.080 align:middle line:90%
which is kind of the SIDS thing.

00:49:25.080 --> 00:49:25.350 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Yes, yes.

00:49:25.350 --> 00:49:26.920 align:middle line:84%
>> GRACE: There's still
this opportunity to--

00:49:26.920 --> 00:49:27.750 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: Thank you
for sharing that.

00:49:27.750 --> 00:49:28.440 align:middle line:90%
>> GRACE: Are you into this?

00:49:28.440 --> 00:49:29.370 align:middle line:90%
Are you not into this?

00:49:29.370 --> 00:49:30.870 align:middle line:84%
And that's where we
see a lot of SIDS.

00:49:30.870 --> 00:49:31.335 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: Thank you
for sharing that.

00:49:31.335 --> 00:49:33.510 align:middle line:84%
>> GRACE: But beautiful in
terms of watching birth.

00:49:33.510 --> 00:49:34.310 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Yes.

00:49:34.310 --> 00:49:35.700 align:middle line:90%
And you can see it.

00:49:35.700 --> 00:49:38.070 align:middle line:84%
When you watch a live
birth, you can feel

00:49:38.070 --> 00:49:40.120 align:middle line:90%
the soul joining with the body.

00:49:40.120 --> 00:49:41.880 align:middle line:84%
And then the breath
and-- oh my god,

00:49:41.880 --> 00:49:43.173 align:middle line:90%
it's just-- who doesn't cry?

00:49:43.173 --> 00:49:44.340 align:middle line:90%
>> GRACE: Wow, it's amazing.

00:49:44.340 --> 00:49:45.548 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: It's so beautiful.

00:49:45.548 --> 00:49:46.770 align:middle line:90%
Thank you for sharing that.

00:49:46.770 --> 00:49:47.200 align:middle line:90%
>> GRACE: For sure.

00:49:47.200 --> 00:49:49.283 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: And so we're
just about to say goodbye.

00:49:49.283 --> 00:49:51.450 align:middle line:84%
And one of the
things you've noticed

00:49:51.450 --> 00:49:54.750 align:middle line:84%
is in these crazy times
where COVID has passed,

00:49:54.750 --> 00:49:57.690 align:middle line:84%
but it left people kind
of ravaged and confused

00:49:57.690 --> 00:50:02.400 align:middle line:84%
and isolated and just left a lot
in its wake with a psychically

00:50:02.400 --> 00:50:04.440 align:middle line:84%
and otherwise, and
one of the things

00:50:04.440 --> 00:50:07.560 align:middle line:84%
you're seeing in the wake
of it is a lot more suicides

00:50:07.560 --> 00:50:10.140 align:middle line:90%
among very young people.

00:50:10.140 --> 00:50:14.170 align:middle line:84%
So just give us a glimpse of
how we might be able to help,

00:50:14.170 --> 00:50:16.740 align:middle line:84%
if we can, with
these young people

00:50:16.740 --> 00:50:18.120 align:middle line:90%
who just can't take it anymore.

00:50:18.120 --> 00:50:20.190 align:middle line:90%
It's too harsh.

00:50:20.190 --> 00:50:21.900 align:middle line:84%
>> GRACE: Remembering
that it's just now.

00:50:21.900 --> 00:50:24.900 align:middle line:84%
We have been through such
an extraordinary time

00:50:24.900 --> 00:50:27.060 align:middle line:84%
this last couple of
years collectively.

00:50:27.060 --> 00:50:31.570 align:middle line:84%
And the density and the
prolonged chaos externally

00:50:31.570 --> 00:50:32.370 align:middle line:90%
is just--

00:50:32.370 --> 00:50:33.700 align:middle line:90%
brought up everybody's shadow.

00:50:33.700 --> 00:50:34.500 align:middle line:90%
Right?

00:50:34.500 --> 00:50:37.000 align:middle line:84%
So many people are facing
so much stuff right now.

00:50:37.000 --> 00:50:39.910 align:middle line:84%
So we are seeing
even more suicides.

00:50:39.910 --> 00:50:41.340 align:middle line:84%
We are seeing a
lot of people that

00:50:41.340 --> 00:50:44.010 align:middle line:84%
had been in addiction
and alcoholic

00:50:44.010 --> 00:50:46.530 align:middle line:84%
in recovery, that they're
falling out and going back.

00:50:46.530 --> 00:50:48.570 align:middle line:84%
And now we've got this
whole fentanyl craze

00:50:48.570 --> 00:50:50.190 align:middle line:90%
that's just mowing people down.

00:50:50.190 --> 00:50:52.200 align:middle line:84%
And they're called
one-offs because it's

00:50:52.200 --> 00:50:53.610 align:middle line:90%
lethal at such a minimal dose.

00:50:53.610 --> 00:50:55.110 align:middle line:84%
And a lot of these
people don't even

00:50:55.110 --> 00:50:56.470 align:middle line:90%
know that they're ingesting it.

00:50:56.470 --> 00:50:57.270 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Right.

00:50:57.270 --> 00:50:59.820 align:middle line:84%
>> GRACE: So that's what's
happening on the streets right

00:50:59.820 --> 00:51:01.840 align:middle line:90%
now is we have huge levels.

00:51:01.840 --> 00:51:04.920 align:middle line:84%
And so for those of us that are
left, yes, it's a heavy time.

00:51:04.920 --> 00:51:08.280 align:middle line:84%
We, those of us that are
sensitive, it's our time.

00:51:08.280 --> 00:51:10.950 align:middle line:84%
We are being called
online for a purpose.

00:51:10.950 --> 00:51:14.010 align:middle line:84%
Like, all of this stuff
that I've been through makes

00:51:14.010 --> 00:51:18.390 align:middle line:84%
sense now because now I'm able
to help bridge the mainstream

00:51:18.390 --> 00:51:20.370 align:middle line:84%
with the energetic
and holistic worlds

00:51:20.370 --> 00:51:22.470 align:middle line:84%
and make this
whole healing world

00:51:22.470 --> 00:51:24.060 align:middle line:90%
and holistic world make sense.

00:51:24.060 --> 00:51:24.510 align:middle line:90%
Right?

00:51:24.510 --> 00:51:25.310 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Yes.

00:51:25.310 --> 00:51:28.050 align:middle line:84%
>> GRACE: So to the people that
are struggling and especially

00:51:28.050 --> 00:51:32.550 align:middle line:84%
those that are sensitive,
yes, I understand it's hard.

00:51:32.550 --> 00:51:34.740 align:middle line:84%
And ultimately, we
have the choice point

00:51:34.740 --> 00:51:35.790 align:middle line:90%
to make the decision.

00:51:35.790 --> 00:51:36.638 align:middle line:90%
Yes, it was hard.

00:51:36.638 --> 00:51:37.680 align:middle line:90%
Yes, it's been traumatic.

00:51:37.680 --> 00:51:40.930 align:middle line:84%
And which way do we
want to go with it?

00:51:40.930 --> 00:51:42.240 align:middle line:90%
Do we want to stay down here?

00:51:42.240 --> 00:51:43.920 align:middle line:84%
Or do we want to
rise up and learn?

00:51:43.920 --> 00:51:45.810 align:middle line:84%
And I'm living
proof that you can

00:51:45.810 --> 00:51:50.580 align:middle line:84%
take hold of these abilities
and use them to help

00:51:50.580 --> 00:51:52.390 align:middle line:90%
in a pretty profound way.

00:51:52.390 --> 00:51:54.150 align:middle line:90%
And I'm not the only one, right?

00:51:54.150 --> 00:51:56.440 align:middle line:84%
And so there's so
many of us now.

00:51:56.440 --> 00:51:59.400 align:middle line:84%
So if you're really
struggling, I understand.

00:51:59.400 --> 00:52:01.050 align:middle line:90%
And, you know, reach out.

00:52:01.050 --> 00:52:03.390 align:middle line:84%
There's people here
that can help navigate.

00:52:03.390 --> 00:52:04.860 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: Yes,
including yourself,

00:52:04.860 --> 00:52:06.390 align:middle line:84%
which we'll get to
in just a second.

00:52:06.390 --> 00:52:09.160 align:middle line:84%
One more comment is-- we
were talking off-camera--

00:52:09.160 --> 00:52:11.670 align:middle line:84%
you said what you're
noticing is the type

00:52:11.670 --> 00:52:14.790 align:middle line:84%
of souls coming into these
little baby bodies now.

00:52:14.790 --> 00:52:16.430 align:middle line:90%
We have powerful entities--

00:52:16.430 --> 00:52:17.430 align:middle line:90%
>> GRACE: Very powerful.

00:52:17.430 --> 00:52:20.370 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: --coming in through
these times of transition now.

00:52:20.370 --> 00:52:20.610 align:middle line:90%
>> GRACE: Mm-hmm.

00:52:20.610 --> 00:52:21.840 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: They're
going to do it.

00:52:21.840 --> 00:52:22.380 align:middle line:90%
>> GRACE: Oh, yes.

00:52:22.380 --> 00:52:23.670 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: And we
are some of them.

00:52:23.670 --> 00:52:24.060 align:middle line:90%
>> GRACE: Indeed.

00:52:24.060 --> 00:52:24.990 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: Some of
us will go away,

00:52:24.990 --> 00:52:27.180 align:middle line:84%
come back as powerful
entities ourselves.

00:52:27.180 --> 00:52:28.020 align:middle line:90%
>> GRACE: Mm.hmm.

00:52:28.020 --> 00:52:29.730 align:middle line:10%
Yeah, the collective
consciousness

00:52:29.730 --> 00:52:31.740 align:middle line:10%
is definitely
shifting as we go away

00:52:31.740 --> 00:52:35.430 align:middle line:10%
from the denser,
darker time, the more

00:52:35.430 --> 00:52:37.080 align:middle line:10%
masculine linear time--

00:52:37.080 --> 00:52:39.840 align:middle line:10%
Piscean Age, if you will, into
more of the Aquarian type,

00:52:39.840 --> 00:52:43.080 align:middle line:10%
feminine, collective, holistic,
all of that kind of stuff.

00:52:43.080 --> 00:52:46.230 align:middle line:84%
And we have a ways before
the pendulum fully swings.

00:52:46.230 --> 00:52:49.080 align:middle line:84%
And this is an incredible
time to be alive.

00:52:49.080 --> 00:52:50.640 align:middle line:90%
It's volatile, yes.

00:52:50.640 --> 00:52:54.930 align:middle line:84%
And if you have the openness,
the willingness, the curiosity,

00:52:54.930 --> 00:52:57.690 align:middle line:84%
you can actually lean
into your abilities

00:52:57.690 --> 00:53:01.000 align:middle line:84%
and utilize these, not
even just as a healer.

00:53:01.000 --> 00:53:03.090 align:middle line:84%
You can take them into
your everyday life,

00:53:03.090 --> 00:53:06.900 align:middle line:84%
and you can impact everyone
around you in a positive way

00:53:06.900 --> 00:53:10.650 align:middle line:84%
if you choose to transmute
your pain and your trauma

00:53:10.650 --> 00:53:11.563 align:middle line:90%
into power.

00:53:11.563 --> 00:53:12.480 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Absolutely.

00:53:12.480 --> 00:53:14.460 align:middle line:84%
Thank you for that
perfect close.

00:53:14.460 --> 00:53:16.130 align:middle line:84%
How can people reach
you, by the way?

00:53:16.130 --> 00:53:17.130 align:middle line:90%

I've got all the things.

00:53:28.930 --> 00:53:29.460 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Excellent.

00:53:29.460 --> 00:53:29.910 align:middle line:90%

your journey with us.

Very, very powerful.

>> GRACE: I
appreciate it so much.

00:53:35.670 --> 00:53:37.740 align:middle line:10%
>> REGINA: Again, the name
of the book is "Journey Into

00:53:37.740 --> 00:53:38.540 align:middle line:10%
Grace."

00:53:38.540 --> 00:53:41.400 align:middle line:10%
Gut wrenching but also very
heartwarming and powerful

00:53:41.400 --> 00:53:44.550 align:middle line:10%
little book on life on Earth
through the lens of energy.

00:53:44.550 --> 00:53:45.580 align:middle line:90%
