00:00:15.497 --> 00:00:17.580 align:middle line:10%
>>REGINA MEREDITH: I'm
going to be introducing you

00:00:17.580 --> 00:00:20.880 align:middle line:10%
to a new channeler on
Gaia today, Wendy Kennedy.

00:00:20.880 --> 00:00:22.680 align:middle line:10%
The areas we're
going to cover have

00:00:22.680 --> 00:00:25.560 align:middle line:10%
to do with what she calls the
operating systems of Earth.

00:00:25.560 --> 00:00:27.900 align:middle line:84%
We're starting with
what Wendy refers to

00:00:27.900 --> 00:00:30.480 align:middle line:90%
as an ongoing frequency war.

00:00:30.480 --> 00:00:32.650 align:middle line:84%
First, let's get to
know her a little bit.

00:00:32.650 --> 00:00:33.450 align:middle line:90%
Welcome.

00:00:33.450 --> 00:00:35.075 align:middle line:84%
I haven't had a chance
to sit with you.

00:00:35.075 --> 00:00:36.930 align:middle line:84%
I know you're a close
friend of Lee Harris,

00:00:36.930 --> 00:00:39.460 align:middle line:84%
and Lee speaks very,
very highly of you.

00:00:39.460 --> 00:00:41.250 align:middle line:84%
And so I'm glad you
finally made it here.

00:00:41.250 --> 00:00:41.790 align:middle line:90%
>>WENDY KENNEDY: Yes.

00:00:41.790 --> 00:00:43.030 align:middle line:90%
Well, thank you for having me.

00:00:43.030 --> 00:00:43.830 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:00:43.830 --> 00:00:47.010 align:middle line:84%
Each person I sit with,
I have a few channelers

00:00:47.010 --> 00:00:49.020 align:middle line:84%
that I interview
regularly, I like

00:00:49.020 --> 00:00:51.370 align:middle line:84%
to get a little bit of their
backstory for the audience

00:00:51.370 --> 00:00:52.690 align:middle line:90%
so we get to know you a bit.

00:00:52.690 --> 00:00:54.840 align:middle line:90%
So what was your life like?

00:00:54.840 --> 00:00:57.660 align:middle line:84%
What happened when you
started channeling?

00:00:57.660 --> 00:00:59.880 align:middle line:90%
And was this a surprise to you?

00:00:59.880 --> 00:01:02.200 align:middle line:90%
And what happened after that?

00:01:02.200 --> 00:01:06.240 align:middle line:10%
>>KENNEDY: So I had a very
average, very normal childhood.

00:01:06.240 --> 00:01:08.590 align:middle line:10%
I was always drawn
to paranormal things,

00:01:08.590 --> 00:01:12.810 align:middle line:10%
whether it was UFOs or
ghosts, that whole thing.

00:01:12.810 --> 00:01:17.500 align:middle line:10%
But it wasn't until my
mid-20s that I started

00:01:17.500 --> 00:01:18.605 align:middle line:10%
to look into channeling.

00:01:18.605 --> 00:01:19.480 align:middle line:10%
I was having visions.

00:01:19.480 --> 00:01:20.900 align:middle line:90%
I didn't know what they were.

00:01:20.900 --> 00:01:22.237 align:middle line:90%
And so I started doing research.

00:01:22.237 --> 00:01:24.070 align:middle line:84%
I thought maybe the
building I was living in

00:01:24.070 --> 00:01:27.250 align:middle line:84%
was haunted, turns out it was
a past life that I was seeing.

00:01:27.250 --> 00:01:29.620 align:middle line:84%
And along the way, I
came across channeling.

00:01:29.620 --> 00:01:30.920 align:middle line:90%
I didn't know what it was.

00:01:30.920 --> 00:01:32.420 align:middle line:84%
I didn't know
anybody who did it.

00:01:32.420 --> 00:01:34.883 align:middle line:84%
I just knew that I was
supposed to be doing it.

00:01:34.883 --> 00:01:37.300 align:middle line:84%
And that was in the mid '90s,
so there weren't a whole lot

00:01:37.300 --> 00:01:38.740 align:middle line:90%
of people out there.

00:01:38.740 --> 00:01:43.330 align:middle line:84%
And so I got a book and I
did some of the exercises.

00:01:43.330 --> 00:01:45.580 align:middle line:84%
And I would have very
visceral responses.

00:01:45.580 --> 00:01:48.770 align:middle line:84%
My eyes would flutter and
water and I would tingle,

00:01:48.770 --> 00:01:50.710 align:middle line:84%
but I just couldn't
get any words out.

00:01:50.710 --> 00:01:52.300 align:middle line:84%
And then probably
about nine months

00:01:52.300 --> 00:01:55.510 align:middle line:84%
after I started
trying to do it, I

00:01:55.510 --> 00:01:58.150 align:middle line:84%
knew one day I was supposed
to sit down with pen and paper

00:01:58.150 --> 00:01:59.770 align:middle line:84%
and I started doing
automatic writing.

00:01:59.770 --> 00:02:01.728 align:middle line:84%
And that's when everything
just kind of started

00:02:01.728 --> 00:02:03.370 align:middle line:90%
to flow from there.

00:02:03.370 --> 00:02:06.640 align:middle line:84%
And that's been 28 years,
which is remarkable to me

00:02:06.640 --> 00:02:10.520 align:middle line:84%
because I can't imagine
that it's been that long.

00:02:10.520 --> 00:02:11.320 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: OK.

00:02:11.320 --> 00:02:13.480 align:middle line:84%
So now, your connection
is specifically

00:02:13.480 --> 00:02:15.370 align:middle line:90%
with the Pleiadians, right?

00:02:15.370 --> 00:02:18.200 align:middle line:84%
>>KENNEDY: They're my primary
contact with the public.

00:02:18.200 --> 00:02:20.860 align:middle line:84%
So I actually work with a lot
of different galactic beings

00:02:20.860 --> 00:02:24.260 align:middle line:84%
but they come through first
and foremost when I do my work.

00:02:24.260 --> 00:02:25.750 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So let's
talk about how

00:02:25.750 --> 00:02:27.490 align:middle line:84%
that relationship
was established

00:02:27.490 --> 00:02:29.402 align:middle line:84%
and how you learned
who they were.

00:02:29.402 --> 00:02:30.860 align:middle line:84%
>>KENNEDY: So when
I first started,

00:02:30.860 --> 00:02:32.950 align:middle line:84%
I was working with my
own angelic guides.

00:02:32.950 --> 00:02:35.530 align:middle line:84%
And then it was probably
about nine months

00:02:35.530 --> 00:02:38.450 align:middle line:84%
when the Pleiadian
collective came in.

00:02:38.450 --> 00:02:41.170 align:middle line:84%
And at that point, I was
doing automatic writing

00:02:41.170 --> 00:02:43.510 align:middle line:84%
for all my channeling but I
was hearing everything well

00:02:43.510 --> 00:02:44.980 align:middle line:90%
in advance of that.

00:02:44.980 --> 00:02:49.430 align:middle line:84%
And the guide said, put down
the pen and just try to speak.

00:02:49.430 --> 00:02:52.690 align:middle line:84%
And once I did that, that's when
the Pleiadian collective came

00:02:52.690 --> 00:02:55.660 align:middle line:84%
through because they actually
work with tone and sound, which

00:02:55.660 --> 00:02:57.860 align:middle line:84%
is why when we
channel a little later

00:02:57.860 --> 00:02:59.838 align:middle line:84%
you'll notice that the
dialect is different.

00:02:59.838 --> 00:03:00.880 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Very different.

00:03:00.880 --> 00:03:03.760 align:middle line:84%
>>KENNEDY: Because
it's really just open

00:03:03.760 --> 00:03:05.777 align:middle line:84%
vowels where they can
modulate the frequency.

00:03:05.777 --> 00:03:07.360 align:middle line:84%
So in addition to
getting information,

00:03:07.360 --> 00:03:09.140 align:middle line:84%
it's as if you're
getting a healing.

00:03:09.140 --> 00:03:11.620 align:middle line:84%
So they were waiting for
me to do that before they

00:03:11.620 --> 00:03:13.300 align:middle line:90%
kind of stepped forward.

00:03:13.300 --> 00:03:16.960 align:middle line:84%
And now they're one
of my primary guides.

00:03:16.960 --> 00:03:19.930 align:middle line:90%
So they are beings of light.

00:03:19.930 --> 00:03:22.600 align:middle line:84%
They don't have physical form
and there are about 2,500

00:03:22.600 --> 00:03:24.040 align:middle line:90%
of them in the collective.

00:03:24.040 --> 00:03:27.310 align:middle line:84%
And rather than incarnate
to a planetary body,

00:03:27.310 --> 00:03:30.200 align:middle line:84%
they actually align
with a stellar body.

00:03:30.200 --> 00:03:34.400 align:middle line:84%
So they align with Alcyone, the
star in the Pleiades system.

00:03:34.400 --> 00:03:35.200 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: OK.

00:03:35.200 --> 00:03:37.540 align:middle line:84%
So what you just
said a moment ago,

00:03:37.540 --> 00:03:40.130 align:middle line:84%
I've always thought it
was Alcyone, like halcyon.

00:03:40.130 --> 00:03:40.930 align:middle line:90%
But it's not.

00:03:40.930 --> 00:03:41.800 align:middle line:90%
How do you pronounce it?

00:03:41.800 --> 00:03:43.550 align:middle line:84%
>>KENNEDY: Well, I
pronounce it both ways.

00:03:43.550 --> 00:03:46.150 align:middle line:84%
They say sometimes
Alcyone or Alcyon-e.

00:03:46.150 --> 00:03:47.320 align:middle line:90%
They'll say it either way.

00:03:47.320 --> 00:03:49.240 align:middle line:84%
But typically, it
doesn't really matter.

00:03:49.240 --> 00:03:50.040 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:03:50.040 --> 00:03:51.070 align:middle line:90%
OK, so Alcyone.

00:03:51.070 --> 00:03:54.100 align:middle line:84%
So now, let's get a
little bit of background

00:03:54.100 --> 00:03:56.260 align:middle line:84%
for those who aren't
already clear on it,

00:03:56.260 --> 00:04:01.750 align:middle line:84%
of who the Pleiadians were to
Earth before, historically?

00:04:01.750 --> 00:04:04.990 align:middle line:84%
What happened and what
they are to us now?

00:04:04.990 --> 00:04:07.480 align:middle line:84%
Because many people
that refer to them,

00:04:07.480 --> 00:04:09.010 align:middle line:84%
the different
influences on Earth,

00:04:09.010 --> 00:04:11.800 align:middle line:84%
we have some that
aren't very friendly,

00:04:11.800 --> 00:04:13.870 align:middle line:84%
and we have those
who are very helpful.

00:04:13.870 --> 00:04:17.540 align:middle line:84%
And the Pleiadians are always
cast as the helpful ones.

00:04:17.540 --> 00:04:19.990 align:middle line:84%
So let's talk about their
history a little bit.

00:04:19.990 --> 00:04:22.089 align:middle line:84%
>>KENNEDY: So they say
that their progenitors.

00:04:22.089 --> 00:04:23.838 align:middle line:90%
That they help to seed us.

00:04:23.838 --> 00:04:25.630 align:middle line:84%
That there are five
root races, and they're

00:04:25.630 --> 00:04:30.140 align:middle line:84%
among the systems that donated
their genetic material.

00:04:30.140 --> 00:04:32.230 align:middle line:84%
And so they've been
with us, they've

00:04:32.230 --> 00:04:33.670 align:middle line:90%
been here on the planet.

00:04:33.670 --> 00:04:39.380 align:middle line:84%
And then they kind of taken a
step back in our development.

00:04:39.380 --> 00:04:42.400 align:middle line:84%
So about 100,000 years
ago, they kind of took

00:04:42.400 --> 00:04:44.470 align:middle line:90%
a bit of a back seat.

00:04:44.470 --> 00:04:45.460 align:middle line:90%
They stepped back.

00:04:45.460 --> 00:04:50.110 align:middle line:84%
And they're here now to help
us to remember who we are.

00:04:50.110 --> 00:04:52.660 align:middle line:84%
The group that I work
with specifically

00:04:52.660 --> 00:04:59.500 align:middle line:84%
part of the blueprint of
Alcyone is to hold records.

00:04:59.500 --> 00:05:02.360 align:middle line:90%
So every star is a library.

00:05:02.360 --> 00:05:04.810 align:middle line:84%
So you can think of us as
like the paperback version,

00:05:04.810 --> 00:05:08.230 align:middle line:84%
and then our son would
be the branch library,

00:05:08.230 --> 00:05:12.710 align:middle line:84%
and then Alcyone is the
main library for our galaxy.

00:05:12.710 --> 00:05:14.930 align:middle line:84%
So it's a repository
for information.

00:05:14.930 --> 00:05:19.160 align:middle line:84%
And so they're here to help
us to remind us of who we are,

00:05:19.160 --> 00:05:21.830 align:middle line:84%
what we're here to
do, our divine nature,

00:05:21.830 --> 00:05:25.700 align:middle line:84%
and how the universal
construct works.

00:05:25.700 --> 00:05:28.190 align:middle line:84%
So they talk a lot about
the process of manifestation

00:05:28.190 --> 00:05:32.910 align:middle line:84%
itself because they want us
to remember our divine nature.

00:05:32.910 --> 00:05:36.410 align:middle line:84%
And so they're kind of stepping
back because they know that

00:05:36.410 --> 00:05:39.050 align:middle line:84%
for most of humanity
right now to come forward

00:05:39.050 --> 00:05:42.510 align:middle line:84%
in a very direct way to show up
physically would generate way

00:05:42.510 --> 00:05:43.310 align:middle line:90%
too much fear.

00:05:43.310 --> 00:05:45.230 align:middle line:90%
And that's counterproductive.

00:05:45.230 --> 00:05:47.690 align:middle line:84%
So they say that most of the
beings who are showing up

00:05:47.690 --> 00:05:49.320 align:middle line:90%
are working one-on-one.

00:05:49.320 --> 00:05:51.655 align:middle line:84%
And if we actually had a
group show up physically,

00:05:51.655 --> 00:05:54.030 align:middle line:84%
it probably would not be a
positive experience right now.

00:05:54.030 --> 00:05:55.930 align:middle line:90%
We're just not quite there.

00:05:55.930 --> 00:05:58.430 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: OK, so this brings
up a number of different tracks

00:05:58.430 --> 00:06:00.680 align:middle line:84%
we could go on and we'll
go on a few of them.

00:06:00.680 --> 00:06:02.310 align:middle line:90%
The notion of manifestation.

00:06:02.310 --> 00:06:03.740 align:middle line:84%
So when we think
of manifestation,

00:06:03.740 --> 00:06:06.360 align:middle line:84%
right now, it's become almost
a bumper sticker and a cliche,

00:06:06.360 --> 00:06:07.160 align:middle line:90%
right?

00:06:07.160 --> 00:06:09.110 align:middle line:84%
Especially to the
new age world, how

00:06:09.110 --> 00:06:11.070 align:middle line:84%
to manifest your
perfect reality.

00:06:11.070 --> 00:06:13.100 align:middle line:84%
But what they're
speaking about is

00:06:13.100 --> 00:06:17.990 align:middle line:84%
we are all creators, how we take
back our creative capacities.

00:06:17.990 --> 00:06:21.740 align:middle line:84%
I assume, I mean, really,
it's more essential than that.

00:06:21.740 --> 00:06:25.580 align:middle line:84%
>>KENNEDY: It is-- it is
and it isn't in a sense

00:06:25.580 --> 00:06:28.698 align:middle line:84%
because this is a game of sorts
and so we're learning just how

00:06:28.698 --> 00:06:30.740 align:middle line:84%
to become more conscious
of every moment of where

00:06:30.740 --> 00:06:31.790 align:middle line:90%
our energy is.

00:06:31.790 --> 00:06:33.680 align:middle line:84%
When we're conscious
of that, then we

00:06:33.680 --> 00:06:35.990 align:middle line:84%
can direct what
we want to create.

00:06:35.990 --> 00:06:38.300 align:middle line:84%
And I think with
manifestation, a lot of people

00:06:38.300 --> 00:06:39.830 align:middle line:84%
think, well, if
it's not showing up,

00:06:39.830 --> 00:06:41.720 align:middle line:90%
I must be doing something wrong.

00:06:41.720 --> 00:06:43.760 align:middle line:84%
But what they teach
is every moment

00:06:43.760 --> 00:06:46.890 align:middle line:84%
shows us how we're expressing
or suppressing our divine light.

00:06:46.890 --> 00:06:49.430 align:middle line:84%
And so when we
learn to use that,

00:06:49.430 --> 00:06:51.740 align:middle line:84%
we can shift
reality very quickly

00:06:51.740 --> 00:06:54.420 align:middle line:84%
and grow very quickly
as a result of that.

00:06:54.420 --> 00:06:57.570 align:middle line:84%
So it's a lot more than just, oh
I want a new car, a new house.

00:06:57.570 --> 00:06:58.370 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Exactly.

00:06:58.370 --> 00:06:59.745 align:middle line:84%
>>KENNEDY: It's
really helping us

00:06:59.745 --> 00:07:03.950 align:middle line:84%
to become more aware
of every single moment

00:07:03.950 --> 00:07:05.540 align:middle line:90%
to be more present.

00:07:05.540 --> 00:07:06.440 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:07:06.440 --> 00:07:07.940 align:middle line:90%
OK, thank you for that.

00:07:07.940 --> 00:07:11.660 align:middle line:84%
The Pleiadians also come
interdimensionally to people,

00:07:11.660 --> 00:07:12.700 align:middle line:90%
like with you.

00:07:12.700 --> 00:07:14.450 align:middle line:84%
Were you bringing the
information through?

00:07:14.450 --> 00:07:17.060 align:middle line:84%
And are they fairly
present on the planet

00:07:17.060 --> 00:07:19.880 align:middle line:84%
to quite a few people
right now to help

00:07:19.880 --> 00:07:24.620 align:middle line:84%
us counteract some of the
more negative influences that

00:07:24.620 --> 00:07:27.930 align:middle line:84%
are going on and help us
regain our sovereignty, really?

00:07:27.930 --> 00:07:28.730 align:middle line:90%
>>KENNEDY: Yes.

00:07:28.730 --> 00:07:31.850 align:middle line:84%
So there are beings who
are-- and this group

00:07:31.850 --> 00:07:33.950 align:middle line:84%
is they're beings of
light, so they actually

00:07:33.950 --> 00:07:36.980 align:middle line:84%
do work behind the scenes
with many different people.

00:07:36.980 --> 00:07:39.140 align:middle line:84%
But then there are
also a lot of souls

00:07:39.140 --> 00:07:41.540 align:middle line:84%
who align with the
Pleiadian star system

00:07:41.540 --> 00:07:46.080 align:middle line:84%
who brought that energy, that
knowledge with them here.

00:07:46.080 --> 00:07:49.790 align:middle line:84%
So in terms of
archetypal patterns

00:07:49.790 --> 00:07:51.830 align:middle line:84%
that come from
every star system,

00:07:51.830 --> 00:07:53.840 align:middle line:84%
people who come from
the Pleiades system

00:07:53.840 --> 00:07:56.850 align:middle line:84%
or aligned with that energy
tend to be teachers and guides

00:07:56.850 --> 00:07:57.650 align:middle line:90%
and healers.

00:07:57.650 --> 00:08:00.650 align:middle line:84%
So a lot of the healers and
guides that we see right now

00:08:00.650 --> 00:08:02.280 align:middle line:90%
are carrying that energy.

00:08:02.280 --> 00:08:05.690 align:middle line:84%
So even though beings
who are at this moment

00:08:05.690 --> 00:08:09.230 align:middle line:84%
incarnated in that system
are working with everybody

00:08:09.230 --> 00:08:12.470 align:middle line:84%
across the board, there are
way more Pleiadian people here,

00:08:12.470 --> 00:08:13.740 align:middle line:90%
if you will.

00:08:13.740 --> 00:08:14.540 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:08:14.540 --> 00:08:15.350 align:middle line:90%
That makes sense.

00:08:15.350 --> 00:08:18.950 align:middle line:84%
And when a Pleiadian chooses to
come here but not necessarily

00:08:18.950 --> 00:08:21.770 align:middle line:84%
by going through the
ordinary incarnation process

00:08:21.770 --> 00:08:24.890 align:middle line:84%
through human vehicle
and they should appear,

00:08:24.890 --> 00:08:28.110 align:middle line:84%
are there kind of hallmarks
as to what they look like?

00:08:28.110 --> 00:08:30.320 align:middle line:84%
>>KENNEDY: So they say
that all the dimensions

00:08:30.320 --> 00:08:32.270 align:middle line:90%
are inhabited in the Pleiades.

00:08:32.270 --> 00:08:35.059 align:middle line:84%
So what we think of as like
the blonde Nordics as they're

00:08:35.059 --> 00:08:36.650 align:middle line:90%
more fifth dimensional beings.

00:08:36.650 --> 00:08:39.950 align:middle line:84%
But they say in that
dimension there are also

00:08:39.950 --> 00:08:42.980 align:middle line:84%
reptilians and felines
that are from the Pleiades.

00:08:42.980 --> 00:08:46.400 align:middle line:84%
They say they define the
system as being an open cluster

00:08:46.400 --> 00:08:48.380 align:middle line:90%
of about 750 stars.

00:08:48.380 --> 00:08:49.910 align:middle line:90%
So it's pretty vast.

00:08:49.910 --> 00:08:51.970 align:middle line:90%
And they say it's very diverse.

00:08:51.970 --> 00:08:52.970 align:middle line:90%
It's like here on Earth.

00:08:52.970 --> 00:08:55.610 align:middle line:84%
There are good people
and people who don't

00:08:55.610 --> 00:08:57.230 align:middle line:90%
have the purest of intentions.

00:08:57.230 --> 00:08:59.270 align:middle line:84%
And it's the same thing
in the Pleiades system.

00:08:59.270 --> 00:09:02.300 align:middle line:84%
But those that we're interacting
with for the most part

00:09:02.300 --> 00:09:07.040 align:middle line:84%
are the more positive
end of the spectrum.

00:09:07.040 --> 00:09:09.890 align:middle line:84%
They say that there are
some of the reptilians who

00:09:09.890 --> 00:09:11.510 align:middle line:90%
are here that will show up.

00:09:11.510 --> 00:09:14.780 align:middle line:84%
They also have the ability
to mask their appearance

00:09:14.780 --> 00:09:18.230 align:middle line:90%
as not to generate more fear.

00:09:18.230 --> 00:09:21.790 align:middle line:84%
But what we think of
more popularly in terms

00:09:21.790 --> 00:09:24.250 align:middle line:84%
of the physicals are
the blonde Nordics

00:09:24.250 --> 00:09:25.400 align:middle line:90%
because that's comfortable.

00:09:25.400 --> 00:09:26.803 align:middle line:90%
You feel safer with that.

00:09:26.803 --> 00:09:28.720 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: But it's
interesting because they're

00:09:28.720 --> 00:09:30.640 align:middle line:84%
saying essentially in
their cluster of stars,

00:09:30.640 --> 00:09:32.140 align:middle line:84%
they go through the
same process, we

00:09:32.140 --> 00:09:33.820 align:middle line:84%
and every other
place goes through.

00:09:33.820 --> 00:09:35.860 align:middle line:84%
And Barbara Hand Clow's
book, "The Alchemy

00:09:35.860 --> 00:09:40.090 align:middle line:84%
of Nine Dimensions," talks about
the reptilians more or less

00:09:40.090 --> 00:09:44.650 align:middle line:84%
managing the fourth dimensional
realm of our human experience.

00:09:44.650 --> 00:09:46.840 align:middle line:84%
So it sounds like in the
Pleiades, it's the same.

00:09:46.840 --> 00:09:49.480 align:middle line:84%
They have their own
multi-dimensional realms

00:09:49.480 --> 00:09:52.670 align:middle line:84%
and all flavors of
entities within the system.

00:09:52.670 --> 00:09:53.470 align:middle line:90%
>>KENNEDY: Yeah.

00:09:53.470 --> 00:09:54.010 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: OK.

00:09:54.010 --> 00:09:56.170 align:middle line:84%
Because usually, we only
hear about the Nordics

00:09:56.170 --> 00:09:59.740 align:middle line:84%
and how the wonderful good
deeds that the Pleiadians do.

00:09:59.740 --> 00:10:02.308 align:middle line:84%
So it's just good
to keep it real.

00:10:02.308 --> 00:10:03.850 align:middle line:84%
>>KENNEDY: It's
pretty diverse, yeah.

00:10:03.850 --> 00:10:04.360 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:10:04.360 --> 00:10:05.160 align:middle line:90%
Interesting.

00:10:05.160 --> 00:10:07.010 align:middle line:84%
Well, I just wanted to
get that background.

00:10:07.010 --> 00:10:08.760 align:middle line:84%
So we're going to talk
about the language.

00:10:08.760 --> 00:10:10.302 align:middle line:84%
We're going to have
you actually give

00:10:10.302 --> 00:10:12.370 align:middle line:84%
a little sample of the
language of light later.

00:10:12.370 --> 00:10:15.335 align:middle line:84%
When did that burst
onto your radar?

00:10:15.335 --> 00:10:16.960 align:middle line:84%
When did this start
coming through you?

00:10:16.960 --> 00:10:18.710 align:middle line:84%
And how did you feel
about it because it's

00:10:18.710 --> 00:10:20.228 align:middle line:90%
very unusual sounding.

00:10:20.228 --> 00:10:21.770 align:middle line:84%
>>KENNEDY: Well,
when I first started

00:10:21.770 --> 00:10:25.220 align:middle line:84%
channeling I was bringing
in beings from Arcturus.

00:10:25.220 --> 00:10:27.980 align:middle line:84%
And I was drawing
a lot of symbols.

00:10:27.980 --> 00:10:31.010 align:middle line:84%
And I didn't know what it
was, I just kept doodling,

00:10:31.010 --> 00:10:32.180 align:middle line:90%
I kept seeing them.

00:10:32.180 --> 00:10:34.860 align:middle line:84%
And they said, this
is a star language.

00:10:34.860 --> 00:10:37.670 align:middle line:84%
And when the Pleiadians
came on the scene,

00:10:37.670 --> 00:10:39.420 align:middle line:84%
that kind of went
by the wayside.

00:10:39.420 --> 00:10:41.240 align:middle line:84%
So probably about
eight years ago,

00:10:41.240 --> 00:10:42.980 align:middle line:84%
they said it's time
to bring that back.

00:10:42.980 --> 00:10:45.450 align:middle line:84%
It's time to start
working with this again.

00:10:45.450 --> 00:10:49.620 align:middle line:84%
And so I started working with
the symbols and then they said,

00:10:49.620 --> 00:10:51.280 align:middle line:90%
we want you to speak it.

00:10:51.280 --> 00:10:53.470 align:middle line:84%
And it's kind of like
it was at the beginning.

00:10:53.470 --> 00:10:55.360 align:middle line:84%
I didn't really know
what I was doing

00:10:55.360 --> 00:11:00.310 align:middle line:84%
but I just opened up and
allowed it to come through.

00:11:00.310 --> 00:11:03.400 align:middle line:84%
And for those who
haven't channeled

00:11:03.400 --> 00:11:06.430 align:middle line:84%
before, it can be kind
of a strange sensation

00:11:06.430 --> 00:11:10.460 align:middle line:84%
but it's getting
out of your own way

00:11:10.460 --> 00:11:13.910 align:middle line:84%
and allowing that energy to flow
through because I couldn't just

00:11:13.910 --> 00:11:15.098 align:middle line:90%
reproduce this myself--

00:11:15.098 --> 00:11:17.390 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: No, when I heard
it, I thought there's no way

00:11:17.390 --> 00:11:19.040 align:middle line:90%
you could consciously do this.

00:11:19.040 --> 00:11:20.090 align:middle line:90%
KENNEDY: Yeah.

00:11:20.090 --> 00:11:24.110 align:middle line:84%
And there's such a push of
energy that comes with it.

00:11:24.110 --> 00:11:26.810 align:middle line:84%
So I allowed that
to come through.

00:11:26.810 --> 00:11:30.290 align:middle line:84%
And it's kind of changed
over the last eight years

00:11:30.290 --> 00:11:31.860 align:middle line:90%
doing it just a little bit.

00:11:31.860 --> 00:11:35.150 align:middle line:84%
And this is one area where
more of the Galactic beings

00:11:35.150 --> 00:11:36.680 align:middle line:90%
tend to come in.

00:11:36.680 --> 00:11:38.280 align:middle line:84%
Because with the
language of light,

00:11:38.280 --> 00:11:40.820 align:middle line:84%
it's comprised of light,
sound, sacred geometry,

00:11:40.820 --> 00:11:42.180 align:middle line:90%
and cosmic information.

00:11:42.180 --> 00:11:44.270 align:middle line:84%
So there's a carrier
wave of information.

00:11:44.270 --> 00:11:47.900 align:middle line:84%
And beings from different
star systems will show up.

00:11:47.900 --> 00:11:49.940 align:middle line:84%
And they've typically
been through what

00:11:49.940 --> 00:11:50.940 align:middle line:90%
we're going through.

00:11:50.940 --> 00:11:53.600 align:middle line:84%
So they're lending
their how-to manual

00:11:53.600 --> 00:11:55.340 align:middle line:90%
as it were in that carrier wave.

00:11:55.340 --> 00:11:57.330 align:middle line:90%
This is how we work through it.

00:11:57.330 --> 00:12:00.665 align:middle line:84%
So when I do the
language of light,

00:12:00.665 --> 00:12:02.430 align:middle line:84%
you may notice that
it shifts a bit.

00:12:02.430 --> 00:12:04.700 align:middle line:84%
And that's because there are
many different beings who

00:12:04.700 --> 00:12:06.870 align:middle line:84%
are coming through to
add that energy into it.

00:12:06.870 --> 00:12:07.670 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Yeah.

00:12:07.670 --> 00:12:08.950 align:middle line:90%
It's fascinating.

00:12:08.950 --> 00:12:11.770 align:middle line:84%
So we'll get to that toward
the end of our conversation.

00:12:11.770 --> 00:12:14.430 align:middle line:84%
So let's start with what we
talked about in the open, which

00:12:14.430 --> 00:12:18.570 align:middle line:84%
has to do with this
period of 2019 to 2026

00:12:18.570 --> 00:12:21.435 align:middle line:84%
and what is called
the frequency wars.

00:12:21.435 --> 00:12:23.055 align:middle line:90%
What are the frequency wars?

00:12:23.055 --> 00:12:26.220 align:middle line:84%
>> KENNEDY: So the guides say
that this is a period where

00:12:26.220 --> 00:12:29.250 align:middle line:84%
there are different beings on
the planet and off-world who

00:12:29.250 --> 00:12:31.680 align:middle line:84%
are vying for control of
frequency on the planet.

00:12:31.680 --> 00:12:34.050 align:middle line:90%
So where is our mindset?

00:12:34.050 --> 00:12:35.673 align:middle line:90%
Where are our emotions?

00:12:35.673 --> 00:12:36.840 align:middle line:90%
What's happening physically?

00:12:36.840 --> 00:12:38.230 align:middle line:90%
Where are we vibrating?

00:12:38.230 --> 00:12:41.640 align:middle line:84%
And this has been going on for
hundreds of thousands of years

00:12:41.640 --> 00:12:42.460 align:middle line:90%
really.

00:12:42.460 --> 00:12:46.630 align:middle line:84%
And we're just now conscious
that it's going on.

00:12:46.630 --> 00:12:48.390 align:middle line:84%
I think people are
starting to wake up

00:12:48.390 --> 00:12:50.250 align:middle line:84%
to see the manipulation
that's happening

00:12:50.250 --> 00:12:53.700 align:middle line:84%
on the day-to-day human
level, but there's

00:12:53.700 --> 00:12:56.250 align:middle line:84%
a whole other level above
that where there are beings

00:12:56.250 --> 00:12:58.290 align:middle line:84%
from different star
systems who have been here,

00:12:58.290 --> 00:13:01.920 align:middle line:84%
who are participating and kind
of controlling and manipulating

00:13:01.920 --> 00:13:02.890 align:middle line:90%
things.

00:13:02.890 --> 00:13:06.760 align:middle line:84%
So we're seeing the
manipulation of frequency.

00:13:06.760 --> 00:13:11.400 align:middle line:84%
Whether it's in how we
are conditioned to think,

00:13:11.400 --> 00:13:14.280 align:middle line:84%
how we're conditioned to
feel, all the things that

00:13:14.280 --> 00:13:15.660 align:middle line:84%
are going on with
our environment

00:13:15.660 --> 00:13:17.153 align:middle line:84%
and how that's
impacting our body.

00:13:17.153 --> 00:13:18.570 align:middle line:84%
Keeping our level
of consciousness

00:13:18.570 --> 00:13:21.112 align:middle line:84%
down because they'd like to see
our consciousness suppressed.

00:13:21.112 --> 00:13:23.980 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: Every being that I've
talked to through Chandler says

00:13:23.980 --> 00:13:24.780 align:middle line:90%
the same thing.

00:13:24.780 --> 00:13:25.710 align:middle line:90%
>> KENNEDY: Yeah.

00:13:25.710 --> 00:13:28.890 align:middle line:84%
And some of these beings
are from Sirius and some

00:13:28.890 --> 00:13:29.890 align:middle line:90%
from Orion.

00:13:29.890 --> 00:13:32.760 align:middle line:84%
So it's kind of a mixture
of the two systems.

00:13:32.760 --> 00:13:38.070 align:middle line:84%
But they're kind of at
the end of their own game.

00:13:38.070 --> 00:13:40.290 align:middle line:84%
The guides say that
really, we have

00:13:40.290 --> 00:13:42.272 align:middle line:90%
crossed a point of no return.

00:13:42.272 --> 00:13:44.730 align:middle line:84%
From their perspective, Earth
will go through the ascension

00:13:44.730 --> 00:13:45.540 align:middle line:90%
process.

00:13:45.540 --> 00:13:47.998 align:middle line:84%
It's just a matter of how it's
going to play out right now.

00:13:47.998 --> 00:13:51.030 align:middle line:84%
And these beings are just
still kind of futilely

00:13:51.030 --> 00:13:53.535 align:middle line:84%
trying to see how
far they can take it.

00:13:53.535 --> 00:13:57.000 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: What are they hoping
to gain in these final moments

00:13:57.000 --> 00:13:58.275 align:middle line:90%
where it's really game over?

00:13:58.275 --> 00:14:00.570 align:middle line:84%
>> KENNEDY: I don't think
they realize it's game over.

00:14:00.570 --> 00:14:01.425 align:middle line:90%
I think that they--

00:14:01.425 --> 00:14:03.720 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: Think they can
still sway the outcome?

00:14:03.720 --> 00:14:04.560 align:middle line:90%
>> KENNEDY: Yes.

00:14:04.560 --> 00:14:05.490 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

00:14:05.490 --> 00:14:08.100 align:middle line:84%
So for them, it's
all about maintaining

00:14:08.100 --> 00:14:10.840 align:middle line:90%
their power and their control.

00:14:10.840 --> 00:14:12.690 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: What is the
nature of the beings?

00:14:12.690 --> 00:14:16.920 align:middle line:84%
We hear from Orion, it often is
associated with reptilian race.

00:14:16.920 --> 00:14:18.766 align:middle line:90%
What about Sirius?

00:14:18.766 --> 00:14:24.220 align:middle line:84%
>> KENNEDY: So Sirius is,
again, a very diverse system.

00:14:24.220 --> 00:14:28.170 align:middle line:84%
So some of these beings look
more humanoid in nature.

00:14:28.170 --> 00:14:29.230 align:middle line:90%
Not all of them.

00:14:29.230 --> 00:14:31.960 align:middle line:84%
Some of them are feline,
some of them are reptilian.

00:14:31.960 --> 00:14:36.700 align:middle line:84%
But the ones that we're being
manipulated by, some of them

00:14:36.700 --> 00:14:40.060 align:middle line:84%
are reptilian, some
of them are Draconian.

00:14:40.060 --> 00:14:43.090 align:middle line:84%
And it's a little
bit of everything.

00:14:43.090 --> 00:14:46.090 align:middle line:84%
But again, they can
mask their appearance

00:14:46.090 --> 00:14:48.778 align:middle line:84%
through holographic
technology so they

00:14:48.778 --> 00:14:51.070 align:middle line:84%
can shift their energetic
fields so that we perceive it

00:14:51.070 --> 00:14:52.570 align:middle line:90%
in a different way.

00:14:52.570 --> 00:14:55.450 align:middle line:84%
And they've been here for
a very, very long time

00:14:55.450 --> 00:14:56.560 align:middle line:90%
on this planet.

00:14:56.560 --> 00:14:59.470 align:middle line:84%
With the fall of Atlantis,
as the guides tell me,

00:14:59.470 --> 00:15:03.460 align:middle line:84%
about 40,000 years
ago, they reappeared.

00:15:03.460 --> 00:15:05.020 align:middle line:90%
They were on Mars at the time.

00:15:05.020 --> 00:15:07.090 align:middle line:84%
And they were waiting
for Atlantis to fall.

00:15:07.090 --> 00:15:08.740 align:middle line:84%
And then they were going
to step forward again.

00:15:08.740 --> 00:15:10.240 align:middle line:84%
So a lot of what
we're going through

00:15:10.240 --> 00:15:14.050 align:middle line:84%
is kind of a repeat of
what has happened before.

00:15:14.050 --> 00:15:15.340 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Interesting.

00:15:15.340 --> 00:15:17.140 align:middle line:90%
So let me ask you this.

00:15:17.140 --> 00:15:19.630 align:middle line:84%
Some of these players
who can holographically

00:15:19.630 --> 00:15:24.550 align:middle line:84%
mask their appearance who
are walking on the Earth,

00:15:24.550 --> 00:15:27.250 align:middle line:84%
are some of these
entities actually

00:15:27.250 --> 00:15:30.220 align:middle line:84%
those that are in positions
of power and influence

00:15:30.220 --> 00:15:32.515 align:middle line:90%
on this planet physically?

00:15:32.515 --> 00:15:34.840 align:middle line:84%
>> KENNEDY: Most of the
ones that are higher up,

00:15:34.840 --> 00:15:35.735 align:middle line:90%
we don't know.

00:15:35.735 --> 00:15:36.860 align:middle line:90%
We don't know who they are.

00:15:36.860 --> 00:15:39.970 align:middle line:84%
But some of the more popular,
more well-known people

00:15:39.970 --> 00:15:43.780 align:middle line:84%
on the planet, some of them are
very popular in pop culture,

00:15:43.780 --> 00:15:45.880 align:middle line:90%
they are within that circle.

00:15:45.880 --> 00:15:46.750 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Yeah.

00:15:46.750 --> 00:15:50.182 align:middle line:84%
>> KENNEDY: But most of the ones
who are masking their image,

00:15:50.182 --> 00:15:51.265 align:middle line:90%
they're in the background.

00:15:51.265 --> 00:15:52.150 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: OK.

00:15:52.150 --> 00:15:54.172 align:middle line:84%
So what I thought
I'd do at this point,

00:15:54.172 --> 00:15:55.630 align:middle line:84%
if you're comfortable
with it, we'd

00:15:55.630 --> 00:15:57.490 align:middle line:84%
go ahead and have
you start channeling.

00:15:57.490 --> 00:16:01.570 align:middle line:84%
And then I'll go ahead and
start talking to your entities

00:16:01.570 --> 00:16:03.820 align:middle line:84%
and what do they
prefer to be called?

00:16:03.820 --> 00:16:05.995 align:middle line:84%
>> KENNEDY: You call
them P's, the P's.

00:16:05.995 --> 00:16:07.670 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: P's and Z's and OK.

00:16:07.670 --> 00:16:08.470 align:middle line:90%
All right.

00:16:08.470 --> 00:16:11.701 align:middle line:90%
We'll talk to the P's.

00:16:11.701 --> 00:16:13.565 align:middle line:84%
>> KENNEDY: I
guess, hello, dear.

00:16:13.565 --> 00:16:15.690 align:middle line:84%
This is the ninth dimensional
Pleiadian collective.

00:16:15.690 --> 00:16:17.065 align:middle line:84%
And it is a pleasure
and an honor

00:16:17.065 --> 00:16:19.780 align:middle line:84%
to have the opportunity
to connect with you.

00:16:19.780 --> 00:16:23.310 align:middle line:84%
So we're happy to be here and to
share our knowledge and wisdom

00:16:23.310 --> 00:16:24.250 align:middle line:90%
with you today.

00:16:24.250 --> 00:16:26.210 align:middle line:84%
So how may we best
be of service to you?

00:16:26.210 --> 00:16:28.710 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: Well, welcome and
thank you for joining all of us

00:16:28.710 --> 00:16:29.510 align:middle line:90%
today.

00:16:29.510 --> 00:16:31.890 align:middle line:84%
And I want to pick up
where Wendy and I were

00:16:31.890 --> 00:16:36.690 align:middle line:84%
speaking a moment ago about this
period between 2019 and 2026.

00:16:36.690 --> 00:16:37.920 align:middle line:90%
Why those years?

00:16:37.920 --> 00:16:40.530 align:middle line:84%
Because it seems like it
wouldn't be coincidental

00:16:40.530 --> 00:16:43.290 align:middle line:84%
that COVID also
popped up in 2019

00:16:43.290 --> 00:16:45.630 align:middle line:84%
and has affected
our reality since.

00:16:45.630 --> 00:16:49.035 align:middle line:84%
Can you talk about those
years and specifically why?

00:16:49.035 --> 00:16:52.660 align:middle line:84%
>> KENNEDY: Well, this is how
we refer to it from the future.

00:16:52.660 --> 00:16:53.460 align:middle line:90%
All right?

00:16:53.460 --> 00:16:54.960 align:middle line:84%
So when you get a little
further down the line

00:16:54.960 --> 00:16:56.910 align:middle line:84%
when looking back,
this is the period.

00:16:56.910 --> 00:16:59.820 align:middle line:84%
And it was from the
future vantage point

00:16:59.820 --> 00:17:03.630 align:middle line:84%
when the push really
started to come out

00:17:03.630 --> 00:17:07.500 align:middle line:84%
of the shadows in terms of
how manipulation was happening

00:17:07.500 --> 00:17:09.970 align:middle line:84%
and it was becoming
more and more obvious.

00:17:09.970 --> 00:17:12.550 align:middle line:84%
So the push and the
very obvious way

00:17:12.550 --> 00:17:16.270 align:middle line:84%
of trying to
control your energy,

00:17:16.270 --> 00:17:20.109 align:middle line:84%
the way that you perceived
your political figures,

00:17:20.109 --> 00:17:21.790 align:middle line:90%
your economic systems.

00:17:21.790 --> 00:17:24.290 align:middle line:84%
There was an
acceleration of that.

00:17:24.290 --> 00:17:26.050 align:middle line:84%
And so from that
future vantage point,

00:17:26.050 --> 00:17:28.220 align:middle line:84%
when looking back
for those years,

00:17:28.220 --> 00:17:31.300 align:middle line:84%
that's why it is
labeled frequency wars.

00:17:31.300 --> 00:17:34.810 align:middle line:84%
Because there are those who are
trying to use your technology

00:17:34.810 --> 00:17:38.740 align:middle line:84%
to influence your energetic
field on a day-to-day basis,

00:17:38.740 --> 00:17:40.510 align:middle line:90%
moment-to-moment basis.

00:17:40.510 --> 00:17:44.110 align:middle line:84%
And your technology
in terms of what

00:17:44.110 --> 00:17:47.590 align:middle line:84%
you think of as
interference, your 5G.

00:17:47.590 --> 00:17:49.730 align:middle line:84%
It is well beyond
where you think it is.

00:17:49.730 --> 00:17:53.050 align:middle line:84%
And the only reason that it's
not being utilized right now

00:17:53.050 --> 00:17:56.502 align:middle line:84%
is because it would create
too much harm in the human

00:17:56.502 --> 00:17:58.210 align:middle line:84%
and people would be
dying left and right.

00:17:58.210 --> 00:17:59.440 align:middle line:90%
You all would notice that.

00:17:59.440 --> 00:18:01.930 align:middle line:84%
You would stand up and say,
there's a real problem here.

00:18:01.930 --> 00:18:02.920 align:middle line:90%
We need to look at it.

00:18:02.920 --> 00:18:04.660 align:middle line:84%
When things are a
little more subtle,

00:18:04.660 --> 00:18:07.490 align:middle line:84%
when you're not seeing it, they
can get away with a lot more.

00:18:07.490 --> 00:18:10.090 align:middle line:84%
So that's why some of
this advanced technology

00:18:10.090 --> 00:18:11.230 align:middle line:90%
hasn't been turned on yet.

00:18:11.230 --> 00:18:12.730 align:middle line:90%
It hasn't been utilized yet.

00:18:12.730 --> 00:18:14.980 align:middle line:84%
Because the effects
of it are too

00:18:14.980 --> 00:18:17.810 align:middle line:84%
effective from
their vantage point.

00:18:17.810 --> 00:18:22.420 align:middle line:84%
So you've also got the
manipulation of thought

00:18:22.420 --> 00:18:25.420 align:middle line:84%
in the way that you are
conditioned and programmed

00:18:25.420 --> 00:18:27.310 align:middle line:90%
to perceive things.

00:18:27.310 --> 00:18:31.540 align:middle line:84%
Most of your news, be it
alternative or mainstream,

00:18:31.540 --> 00:18:33.640 align:middle line:90%
is one-sided.

00:18:33.640 --> 00:18:34.930 align:middle line:90%
It is the negative.

00:18:34.930 --> 00:18:37.990 align:middle line:84%
What is happening
in terms of what

00:18:37.990 --> 00:18:40.728 align:middle line:84%
is wrong with the planet
or the story of what

00:18:40.728 --> 00:18:41.770 align:middle line:90%
is wrong with the planet.

00:18:41.770 --> 00:18:43.270 align:middle line:84%
Because there's
actually quite a bit

00:18:43.270 --> 00:18:45.520 align:middle line:84%
that is positive
about the planet.

00:18:45.520 --> 00:18:49.660 align:middle line:84%
If you were all fed a steady
diet of all the good things

00:18:49.660 --> 00:18:52.060 align:middle line:84%
that were happening on the
planet on a day-to-day basis,

00:18:52.060 --> 00:18:53.920 align:middle line:84%
your reality would
be vastly different,

00:18:53.920 --> 00:18:56.650 align:middle line:84%
because you would think
in a different way.

00:18:56.650 --> 00:19:00.040 align:middle line:84%
But there are those who really
understand the programming

00:19:00.040 --> 00:19:01.430 align:middle line:90%
of the mind and how it works.

00:19:01.430 --> 00:19:06.580 align:middle line:84%
And they have utilized that
awareness to really get you

00:19:06.580 --> 00:19:08.673 align:middle line:90%
within a very limited range.

00:19:08.673 --> 00:19:10.090 align:middle line:84%
And then there's
everything that's

00:19:10.090 --> 00:19:12.970 align:middle line:84%
been going on in terms of your
food and your environment.

00:19:12.970 --> 00:19:15.520 align:middle line:84%
The chemicals that have
been introduced that

00:19:15.520 --> 00:19:19.300 align:middle line:84%
are lowering your sensitivity
that your body is working

00:19:19.300 --> 00:19:22.810 align:middle line:84%
so hard just to purify itself
that you can't really access

00:19:22.810 --> 00:19:24.730 align:middle line:90%
some of the higher frequencies.

00:19:24.730 --> 00:19:28.180 align:middle line:84%
Especially when your
thoughts are so negative

00:19:28.180 --> 00:19:31.150 align:middle line:84%
and your emotions are so
heavy, it is very difficult

00:19:31.150 --> 00:19:34.990 align:middle line:84%
unless you understand how
to get in the driver's seat,

00:19:34.990 --> 00:19:39.310 align:middle line:84%
how to alter your own
energetic field to move out

00:19:39.310 --> 00:19:43.250 align:middle line:84%
of that range of frequencies so
that you can change what you're

00:19:43.250 --> 00:19:44.050 align:middle line:90%
manifesting.

00:19:44.050 --> 00:19:47.055 align:middle line:84%
And that's what they are hoping
that you're not going to learn.

00:19:47.055 --> 00:19:48.000 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Right.

00:19:48.000 --> 00:19:48.800 align:middle line:90%
Right.

00:19:48.800 --> 00:19:51.160 align:middle line:84%
So it seems that what we're
talking about here is,

00:19:51.160 --> 00:19:53.770 align:middle line:84%
we have those entities
that have been interfering

00:19:53.770 --> 00:19:56.530 align:middle line:84%
and controlling and attempting
to control for a very, very

00:19:56.530 --> 00:19:57.640 align:middle line:90%
long period of time.

00:19:57.640 --> 00:20:00.130 align:middle line:84%
At the same time, there have
been countervailing forces

00:20:00.130 --> 00:20:02.590 align:middle line:84%
such as yourselves and
others who are coming.

00:20:02.590 --> 00:20:05.050 align:middle line:84%
But the difference
it seems to be

00:20:05.050 --> 00:20:08.200 align:middle line:84%
is by virtue of the way the
others are doing things,

00:20:08.200 --> 00:20:10.420 align:middle line:84%
they're not playing
by ethical standards

00:20:10.420 --> 00:20:13.090 align:middle line:84%
where you and the others
who are coming to help

00:20:13.090 --> 00:20:16.870 align:middle line:84%
seem to be more bound by ethical
standards, which is harder

00:20:16.870 --> 00:20:21.653 align:middle line:84%
to come in and have such a
bold influence, should we say.

00:20:21.653 --> 00:20:22.570 align:middle line:90%
Can you talk about it?

00:20:22.570 --> 00:20:25.030 align:middle line:84%
Because it seems very
unfair on one level.

00:20:25.030 --> 00:20:27.280 align:middle line:84%
>> KENNEDY: Well, we don't
really think of it in terms

00:20:27.280 --> 00:20:29.590 align:middle line:84%
of what is ethical,
what is not ethical.

00:20:29.590 --> 00:20:33.580 align:middle line:84%
Because to one species,
how they function

00:20:33.580 --> 00:20:36.430 align:middle line:84%
is going to be very different
than how you function.

00:20:36.430 --> 00:20:40.400 align:middle line:84%
Here you are existing on what
we call the planet of emotion.

00:20:40.400 --> 00:20:41.200 align:middle line:90%
All right.

00:20:41.200 --> 00:20:42.700 align:middle line:84%
If you want to learn
about emotions,

00:20:42.700 --> 00:20:44.290 align:middle line:84%
you go and you
incarnate to Earth.

00:20:44.290 --> 00:20:45.760 align:middle line:90%
Earth is a grand experiment.

00:20:45.760 --> 00:20:49.680 align:middle line:84%
It was donated-- material,
genetic material from thousands

00:20:49.680 --> 00:20:50.680 align:middle line:90%
and thousands of worlds.

00:20:50.680 --> 00:20:52.270 align:middle line:84%
And along with that
genetic material

00:20:52.270 --> 00:20:54.830 align:middle line:84%
comes all the
emotional component.

00:20:54.830 --> 00:20:58.180 align:middle line:84%
So here on Earth, you've
got your extreme say,

00:20:58.180 --> 00:21:01.450 align:middle line:84%
black and white with 1,000
shades of gray in between.

00:21:01.450 --> 00:21:03.820 align:middle line:84%
And then some of
these species may only

00:21:03.820 --> 00:21:06.380 align:middle line:84%
have a very small
range of emotions.

00:21:06.380 --> 00:21:09.700 align:middle line:84%
So for them, the way that
they perceive reality

00:21:09.700 --> 00:21:11.400 align:middle line:90%
is vastly different.

00:21:11.400 --> 00:21:14.990 align:middle line:84%
So when you say is it
ethical or non-ethical,

00:21:14.990 --> 00:21:16.730 align:middle line:84%
it's all a matter
of perspective.

00:21:16.730 --> 00:21:19.100 align:middle line:84%
And their reality is
so vastly different

00:21:19.100 --> 00:21:21.140 align:middle line:90%
how they process information.

00:21:21.140 --> 00:21:25.430 align:middle line:84%
That they cannot see it in the
same way that you can see it.

00:21:25.430 --> 00:21:27.552 align:middle line:84%
One of the gifts
of humanity, what

00:21:27.552 --> 00:21:29.510 align:middle line:84%
you are going to share
with the entire universe

00:21:29.510 --> 00:21:31.460 align:middle line:84%
as you go through
this ascension process

00:21:31.460 --> 00:21:33.920 align:middle line:90%
is the gift of compassion.

00:21:33.920 --> 00:21:39.380 align:middle line:84%
Because you have so much
emotion to deal with here,

00:21:39.380 --> 00:21:42.590 align:middle line:84%
you know how difficult
it can be and what

00:21:42.590 --> 00:21:45.050 align:middle line:84%
that feels like to be
in that lower resonance,

00:21:45.050 --> 00:21:47.390 align:middle line:84%
to be in that pain,
in that suffering.

00:21:47.390 --> 00:21:51.470 align:middle line:84%
That you access compassion in
a way that even we in the ninth

00:21:51.470 --> 00:21:53.420 align:middle line:90%
dimension cannot access it.

00:21:53.420 --> 00:21:57.560 align:middle line:84%
It is so much more powerful
the way that you express it,

00:21:57.560 --> 00:22:02.750 align:middle line:84%
because you have embodied some
of those lower frequencies.

00:22:02.750 --> 00:22:04.910 align:middle line:84%
And as you go through
this ascension process,

00:22:04.910 --> 00:22:06.380 align:middle line:90%
you let go of your judgment.

00:22:06.380 --> 00:22:10.490 align:middle line:84%
Because really, it is judgment
that you are releasing in order

00:22:10.490 --> 00:22:13.530 align:middle line:84%
to increase your frequency
that allows you to go

00:22:13.530 --> 00:22:15.300 align:middle line:90%
through the ascension process.

00:22:15.300 --> 00:22:18.480 align:middle line:84%
As you do that, you will
access this compassion.

00:22:18.480 --> 00:22:21.540 align:middle line:84%
And it will have a ripple effect
through the entire universe.

00:22:21.540 --> 00:22:23.550 align:middle line:84%
Because you've got
the genetic material

00:22:23.550 --> 00:22:25.650 align:middle line:84%
from thousands and
thousands of worlds.

00:22:25.650 --> 00:22:29.880 align:middle line:10%
That information is sent
off to all of those beings.

00:22:29.880 --> 00:22:31.380 align:middle line:90%
And it is a game changer.

00:22:31.380 --> 00:22:33.720 align:middle line:84%
And it doesn't matter
whether they're

00:22:33.720 --> 00:22:36.840 align:middle line:84%
existing in the past or the
future because it's all one.

00:22:36.840 --> 00:22:40.680 align:middle line:84%
They will have the benefit
of accessing that information

00:22:40.680 --> 00:22:42.570 align:middle line:90%
should they choose to.

00:22:42.570 --> 00:22:45.090 align:middle line:90%
It's a whole other conversation.

00:22:45.090 --> 00:22:50.700 align:middle line:84%
But to bring it back around
to the question here,

00:22:50.700 --> 00:22:58.260 align:middle line:84%
you all have the ability to
access those higher frequencies

00:22:58.260 --> 00:23:00.300 align:middle line:90%
in any given moment.

00:23:00.300 --> 00:23:06.580 align:middle line:84%
And you simply have to
make small adjustments.

00:23:06.580 --> 00:23:07.380 align:middle line:90%
All right?

00:23:07.380 --> 00:23:09.130 align:middle line:90%
It can be very, very simple.

00:23:09.130 --> 00:23:11.790 align:middle line:84%
It's just a matter of you
coming back to your power

00:23:11.790 --> 00:23:14.510 align:middle line:84%
and coming back to your
awareness that it is possible.

00:23:14.510 --> 00:23:16.480 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: So
thank you for that.

00:23:16.480 --> 00:23:19.980 align:middle line:84%
So back to my original
question, my judgment

00:23:19.980 --> 00:23:24.750 align:middle line:84%
that it seems to be exploitive,
once this notion of compassion

00:23:24.750 --> 00:23:27.960 align:middle line:84%
has been exported over
a vast period of time

00:23:27.960 --> 00:23:31.140 align:middle line:84%
and to a vast array
of species, might it

00:23:31.140 --> 00:23:33.120 align:middle line:84%
be that the very
people are beings

00:23:33.120 --> 00:23:36.450 align:middle line:84%
that are kind of perpetuating
these things that keep humanity

00:23:36.450 --> 00:23:40.020 align:middle line:84%
exhausted and in fear
and so forth, might then

00:23:40.020 --> 00:23:43.860 align:middle line:84%
see that this isn't to their own
benefit to do this any longer.

00:23:43.860 --> 00:23:44.850 align:middle line:90%
>> KENNEDY: Yes.

00:23:44.850 --> 00:23:49.470 align:middle line:84%
And remember that you
don't just incarnate

00:23:49.470 --> 00:23:51.820 align:middle line:90%
on one end of the spectrum.

00:23:51.820 --> 00:23:53.230 align:middle line:90%
You incarnate to both.

00:23:53.230 --> 00:23:56.820 align:middle line:84%
So some of you have really done
some terribly dastardly deeds

00:23:56.820 --> 00:23:57.690 align:middle line:90%
in other lifetimes.

00:23:57.690 --> 00:23:59.440 align:middle line:84%
And this one might
be more positive.

00:23:59.440 --> 00:24:03.240 align:middle line:84%
So it allows for a healing
of the entire universe.

00:24:03.240 --> 00:24:06.120 align:middle line:84%
And it is allowed to
go on, because this

00:24:06.120 --> 00:24:08.650 align:middle line:90%
is an exploration in duality.

00:24:08.650 --> 00:24:11.230 align:middle line:84%
So these beings, while they
are being quote unquote,

00:24:11.230 --> 00:24:13.150 align:middle line:84%
"unethical" from
your perspective,

00:24:13.150 --> 00:24:15.182 align:middle line:84%
they're also a mirror
for you to see where--

00:24:15.182 --> 00:24:16.390 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Well, that's true.

00:24:16.390 --> 00:24:18.835 align:middle line:84%
We do all these things
and more to each other.

00:24:18.835 --> 00:24:19.930 align:middle line:90%
>> KENNEDY: Yes.

00:24:19.930 --> 00:24:27.150 align:middle line:84%
And sometimes, it's
such a dramatic level

00:24:27.150 --> 00:24:29.770 align:middle line:84%
and in such a way that
creates tremendous pain just

00:24:29.770 --> 00:24:31.630 align:middle line:84%
as much as some of
these beings do.

00:24:31.630 --> 00:24:35.080 align:middle line:84%
So they're there to
be the mirror for you,

00:24:35.080 --> 00:24:36.763 align:middle line:84%
because in duality
without the mirror,

00:24:36.763 --> 00:24:39.430 align:middle line:84%
it is very difficult for you all
to see the frequencies that you

00:24:39.430 --> 00:24:40.230 align:middle line:90%
may be holding.

00:24:40.230 --> 00:24:43.330 align:middle line:84%
And they may be doing it in a
very bold, very dramatic way,

00:24:43.330 --> 00:24:44.860 align:middle line:84%
but in your own
personal life, you

00:24:44.860 --> 00:24:46.542 align:middle line:84%
might be doing it
in a minor way.

00:24:46.542 --> 00:24:48.625 align:middle line:84%
It's still the same frequency
that you're holding.

00:24:48.625 --> 00:24:49.150 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Yeah.

00:24:49.150 --> 00:24:49.300 align:middle line:90%
No.

00:24:49.300 --> 00:24:50.260 align:middle line:90%
That makes sense.

00:24:50.260 --> 00:24:53.020 align:middle line:84%
Well, before we go on,
I wanted to get back

00:24:53.020 --> 00:24:54.310 align:middle line:90%
to something you mentioned.

00:24:54.310 --> 00:24:57.250 align:middle line:84%
Technologies that exist that
are far advanced of what we know

00:24:57.250 --> 00:25:00.520 align:middle line:84%
but that haven't been
unleashed yet, such as 5G.

00:25:00.520 --> 00:25:04.510 align:middle line:84%
Is it also the case that
there's one technology

00:25:04.510 --> 00:25:07.570 align:middle line:84%
I know of that seems to
be proving to mitigate

00:25:07.570 --> 00:25:10.450 align:middle line:84%
these frequencies,
the focused life force

00:25:10.450 --> 00:25:14.140 align:middle line:84%
energy-- the FLFE energy,
seems to be coming in.

00:25:14.140 --> 00:25:17.020 align:middle line:84%
And when it's in
an environment, it

00:25:17.020 --> 00:25:20.720 align:middle line:84%
can ameliorate
these frequencies.

00:25:20.720 --> 00:25:22.990 align:middle line:84%
Now, they're not at
their full capacity yet.

00:25:22.990 --> 00:25:27.100 align:middle line:84%
Are there other inventors and
people from our deep past--

00:25:27.100 --> 00:25:30.610 align:middle line:84%
Atlantean times or maybe
bringing fresh information

00:25:30.610 --> 00:25:36.130 align:middle line:84%
in that is going to kind of
rise alongside the introduction

00:25:36.130 --> 00:25:38.080 align:middle line:90%
of these negative technologies?

00:25:38.080 --> 00:25:40.210 align:middle line:84%
Are we going to have as
much positive coming in

00:25:40.210 --> 00:25:43.460 align:middle line:84%
to essentially negate
or ameliorate it?

00:25:43.460 --> 00:25:44.260 align:middle line:90%
>> KENNEDY: Yes.

00:25:44.260 --> 00:25:46.450 align:middle line:84%
So there's a lot to
cover in that one.

00:25:46.450 --> 00:25:47.520 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Yeah.

00:25:47.520 --> 00:25:48.557 align:middle line:90%
But we want to know.

00:25:48.557 --> 00:25:50.140 align:middle line:84%
This audience would
like to know that.

00:25:50.140 --> 00:25:51.522 align:middle line:84%
>> KENNEDY: When
you get to 2026,

00:25:51.522 --> 00:25:53.230 align:middle line:84%
that's when things
really start to shift.

00:25:53.230 --> 00:25:57.610 align:middle line:84%
So some of these more
positive technologies

00:25:57.610 --> 00:25:59.050 align:middle line:90%
will start to come on the scene.

00:25:59.050 --> 00:26:01.570 align:middle line:84%
Things that will help humanity
to heal the damage that

00:26:01.570 --> 00:26:05.320 align:middle line:84%
has been done to the physical
body, to Mother Earth herself.

00:26:05.320 --> 00:26:06.730 align:middle line:84%
There's a whole
agenda with that.

00:26:06.730 --> 00:26:09.340 align:middle line:84%
Yes, you are polluting, but
there are also other agendas

00:26:09.340 --> 00:26:11.690 align:middle line:90%
within that are about control.

00:26:11.690 --> 00:26:15.080 align:middle line:84%
So when you're talking
about global warming,

00:26:15.080 --> 00:26:15.880 align:middle line:90%
that's an agenda.

00:26:15.880 --> 00:26:16.680 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Yes.

00:26:16.680 --> 00:26:22.930 align:middle line:84%
>> KENNEDY: So you will, as you
heal yourselves individually,

00:26:22.930 --> 00:26:24.410 align:middle line:90%
help Mother Earth to heal.

00:26:24.410 --> 00:26:27.910 align:middle line:84%
So the healing of the planet
can happen quite rapidly.

00:26:27.910 --> 00:26:30.700 align:middle line:84%
Some of this will be
from technology, but also

00:26:30.700 --> 00:26:32.690 align:middle line:84%
through your
internal technology.

00:26:32.690 --> 00:26:35.380 align:middle line:84%
So when you ask,
is there technology

00:26:35.380 --> 00:26:37.000 align:middle line:90%
that can help to mitigate this?

00:26:37.000 --> 00:26:39.953 align:middle line:84%
The best thing that you can
do is to hold your resonance.

00:26:39.953 --> 00:26:41.620 align:middle line:84%
To keep coming back
to the heart center.

00:26:41.620 --> 00:26:43.930 align:middle line:84%
Because that, as you
are pulsing out energy,

00:26:43.930 --> 00:26:45.430 align:middle line:90%
is a natural barrier.

00:26:45.430 --> 00:26:48.010 align:middle line:84%
When you're pulsing out
that higher frequency,

00:26:48.010 --> 00:26:51.130 align:middle line:84%
that lower frequency does
not interfere with it

00:26:51.130 --> 00:26:52.390 align:middle line:90%
in the same way.

00:26:52.390 --> 00:26:54.580 align:middle line:84%
And that's also
what they don't want

00:26:54.580 --> 00:26:56.380 align:middle line:90%
you to know and to understand.

00:26:56.380 --> 00:26:58.490 align:middle line:84%
That you have the
internal technology.

00:26:58.490 --> 00:27:00.550 align:middle line:84%
It's just a matter
of a practice where

00:27:00.550 --> 00:27:02.740 align:middle line:84%
you are aware of
your energy, that you

00:27:02.740 --> 00:27:05.140 align:middle line:84%
are deciding the frequency
that you want to embody

00:27:05.140 --> 00:27:08.560 align:middle line:84%
and you are pulsing it out and
coming back to your awareness

00:27:08.560 --> 00:27:11.180 align:middle line:84%
moment to moment to moment to
keep deciding and pulsing that

00:27:11.180 --> 00:27:11.980 align:middle line:90%
out.

00:27:11.980 --> 00:27:14.800 align:middle line:84%
When you do that,
it is very difficult

00:27:14.800 --> 00:27:16.550 align:middle line:90%
to interfere with you.

00:27:16.550 --> 00:27:17.562 align:middle line:90%
It is very difficult.

00:27:17.562 --> 00:27:19.270 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: Very
important for us to know.

00:27:19.270 --> 00:27:23.260 align:middle line:84%
>> KENNEDY: So you are far, far,
far more powerful than you have

00:27:23.260 --> 00:27:24.785 align:middle line:90%
given yourself credit.

00:27:24.785 --> 00:27:25.660 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: All right.

00:27:25.660 --> 00:27:28.960 align:middle line:90%
So this number, 2026.

00:27:28.960 --> 00:27:30.550 align:middle line:90%
The year 2026.

00:27:30.550 --> 00:27:33.050 align:middle line:84%
This keeps coming up in
a lot of people's work.

00:27:33.050 --> 00:27:35.890 align:middle line:84%
Whether it's human design,
the creator of human design,

00:27:35.890 --> 00:27:39.880 align:middle line:84%
the creator of Gene Keys, the
channeling from the Z's-- from

00:27:39.880 --> 00:27:40.960 align:middle line:90%
you, the P's.

00:27:40.960 --> 00:27:43.330 align:middle line:90%
What is it about 2026?

00:27:43.330 --> 00:27:45.430 align:middle line:90%
What is this essential shift?

00:27:45.430 --> 00:27:51.520 align:middle line:84%
Because in the words of
Raph with the Gene Keys,

00:27:51.520 --> 00:27:53.800 align:middle line:84%
he said humanity
actually starts taking

00:27:53.800 --> 00:27:56.890 align:middle line:84%
on different characteristics,
beginning in 2026

00:27:56.890 --> 00:27:58.420 align:middle line:90%
and over a long period of time.

00:27:58.420 --> 00:27:59.800 align:middle line:90%
What's this about?

00:27:59.800 --> 00:28:04.570 align:middle line:84%
>> KENNEDY: So starting in
2024, you all are going to start

00:28:04.570 --> 00:28:10.110 align:middle line:84%
making changes in terms of your
systems, your institutions.

00:28:10.110 --> 00:28:11.730 align:middle line:84%
You're going to
see at that point

00:28:11.730 --> 00:28:14.090 align:middle line:84%
that things are horribly
broken globally.

00:28:14.090 --> 00:28:15.840 align:middle line:84%
And you're going to
start to make changes.

00:28:15.840 --> 00:28:18.060 align:middle line:90%
It's really not until 2026.

00:28:18.060 --> 00:28:20.040 align:middle line:84%
You have the
breakthrough with that.

00:28:20.040 --> 00:28:22.620 align:middle line:84%
Part of it has to do
with the sector of space

00:28:22.620 --> 00:28:23.880 align:middle line:90%
that you're moving through.

00:28:23.880 --> 00:28:26.850 align:middle line:84%
This particular sector is
rich with photonic energy.

00:28:26.850 --> 00:28:29.880 align:middle line:84%
And you can think
about a track that

00:28:29.880 --> 00:28:32.260 align:middle line:90%
has a start and a finish line.

00:28:32.260 --> 00:28:34.782 align:middle line:84%
So when you move through
the sector of space,

00:28:34.782 --> 00:28:36.990 align:middle line:84%
this is where you start and
this is where you finish,

00:28:36.990 --> 00:28:38.760 align:middle line:90%
except you're spiraling up.

00:28:38.760 --> 00:28:41.250 align:middle line:84%
And what it does is
it allows you access

00:28:41.250 --> 00:28:43.360 align:middle line:90%
to higher vibrational energy.

00:28:43.360 --> 00:28:46.410 align:middle line:84%
So when you get to
2026, you really

00:28:46.410 --> 00:28:49.620 align:middle line:84%
are being bombarded by more
and more of this light,

00:28:49.620 --> 00:28:51.150 align:middle line:90%
this high frequency light.

00:28:51.150 --> 00:28:54.270 align:middle line:84%
And that is also
helping you to awaken.

00:28:54.270 --> 00:29:01.140 align:middle line:84%
And as we said, as you start
to do your internal work, which

00:29:01.140 --> 00:29:02.640 align:middle line:84%
is letting go of
judgment, and you

00:29:02.640 --> 00:29:04.860 align:middle line:84%
start living from your
heart-centered space,

00:29:04.860 --> 00:29:07.450 align:middle line:84%
you will alter
your genetic code.

00:29:07.450 --> 00:29:12.070 align:middle line:84%
There is DNA that is
constructed of light

00:29:12.070 --> 00:29:15.100 align:middle line:84%
that is not active in
your body at the moment.

00:29:15.100 --> 00:29:18.940 align:middle line:84%
It is only as you hold high
frequency energy, which

00:29:18.940 --> 00:29:21.190 align:middle line:84%
allows that higher
frequency of light

00:29:21.190 --> 00:29:23.410 align:middle line:84%
to run through it that
it becomes activated.

00:29:23.410 --> 00:29:26.980 align:middle line:84%
And at 2026, when you're moving
through this sector of space

00:29:26.980 --> 00:29:29.290 align:middle line:84%
and you are learning
to hold a higher

00:29:29.290 --> 00:29:32.860 align:middle line:84%
resonance within your own field,
this starts to get activated.

00:29:32.860 --> 00:29:37.610 align:middle line:84%
It will allow for new
intuitive gifts to come online,

00:29:37.610 --> 00:29:42.850 align:middle line:84%
it will allow you to manifest
in a much more expeditious way

00:29:42.850 --> 00:29:45.250 align:middle line:84%
that things can really
show up very, very

00:29:45.250 --> 00:29:47.530 align:middle line:84%
quickly and without
as much effort

00:29:47.530 --> 00:29:49.420 align:middle line:84%
as you may have put
into it in the past.

00:29:49.420 --> 00:29:52.210 align:middle line:84%
Because you're not trying to
control and manipulate things

00:29:52.210 --> 00:29:54.460 align:middle line:84%
with the mind,
you're simply living

00:29:54.460 --> 00:29:56.230 align:middle line:84%
from the heart-centered
space and in flow

00:29:56.230 --> 00:29:57.560 align:middle line:90%
with the natural rhythms.

00:29:57.560 --> 00:29:59.415 align:middle line:84%
So things manifest
quite quickly that way.

00:29:59.415 --> 00:30:02.770 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: And I would think
that this is all open and kind

00:30:02.770 --> 00:30:05.530 align:middle line:84%
of a starting point for the
entities that start being

00:30:05.530 --> 00:30:07.180 align:middle line:90%
birthed at that period of time.

00:30:07.180 --> 00:30:09.895 align:middle line:84%
They're coming into that light
with that activation already.

00:30:09.895 --> 00:30:10.285 align:middle line:90%
>> KENNEDY: Yeas.

00:30:10.285 --> 00:30:12.620 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: So I would think
with that generation of beings,

00:30:12.620 --> 00:30:15.037 align:middle line:84%
which is the new generation,
I think they're called alphas

00:30:15.037 --> 00:30:18.430 align:middle line:84%
now, we should start seeing a
lot of inventiveness and a lot

00:30:18.430 --> 00:30:20.290 align:middle line:84%
of breakthroughs,
I would assume,

00:30:20.290 --> 00:30:22.090 align:middle line:84%
with that generation
in particular.

00:30:22.090 --> 00:30:22.960 align:middle line:90%
And even before.

00:30:22.960 --> 00:30:23.620 align:middle line:90%
>> KENNEDY: Yes.

00:30:23.620 --> 00:30:24.655 align:middle line:84%
You're going to see
it really before.

00:30:24.655 --> 00:30:25.180 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Yeah.

00:30:25.180 --> 00:30:25.980 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:30:25.980 --> 00:30:28.810 align:middle line:84%
>> KENNEDY: Probably beings who
are about 10 to 15 years old

00:30:28.810 --> 00:30:33.615 align:middle line:84%
right now as they're starting
to get into their teen years,

00:30:33.615 --> 00:30:36.970 align:middle line:84%
their late teens,
they're quite inventive.

00:30:36.970 --> 00:30:40.450 align:middle line:84%
And so you will find a lot
of very young inventors

00:30:40.450 --> 00:30:41.350 align:middle line:90%
and engineers.

00:30:41.350 --> 00:30:42.850 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: That's exciting.

00:30:42.850 --> 00:30:46.585 align:middle line:84%
So getting down to some
really practical elements

00:30:46.585 --> 00:30:50.470 align:middle line:84%
of using our innate
abilities and power

00:30:50.470 --> 00:30:54.010 align:middle line:84%
and manifesting at a new level,
of course, the thing that

00:30:54.010 --> 00:30:56.530 align:middle line:84%
has kept people from
doing that are not just

00:30:56.530 --> 00:30:59.470 align:middle line:84%
belief systems but
exhaustion and being

00:30:59.470 --> 00:31:02.170 align:middle line:84%
kept in a kind of perpetual
state of low-grade fear

00:31:02.170 --> 00:31:03.710 align:middle line:90%
and anxiety.

00:31:03.710 --> 00:31:07.930 align:middle line:84%
So first of all, dealing with
the fear and anxiety, which

00:31:07.930 --> 00:31:10.420 align:middle line:84%
dampens joy, which
dampens creativity,

00:31:10.420 --> 00:31:14.305 align:middle line:84%
can you talk about how we shift
out of that kind of matrix?

00:31:14.305 --> 00:31:17.680 align:middle line:84%
>> KENNEDY: So you have what
we consider to be two operating

00:31:17.680 --> 00:31:19.240 align:middle line:90%
systems here in this dimension.

00:31:19.240 --> 00:31:22.630 align:middle line:84%
Part of the game was to
see if you could come down

00:31:22.630 --> 00:31:25.240 align:middle line:84%
in frequency,
forget who you are,

00:31:25.240 --> 00:31:29.050 align:middle line:84%
and then come back out of it
to remember your divine nature.

00:31:29.050 --> 00:31:31.540 align:middle line:84%
So that is the
essence of this game.

00:31:31.540 --> 00:31:35.650 align:middle line:84%
And you are coming to
the end of that cycle,

00:31:35.650 --> 00:31:38.960 align:middle line:84%
of the end of the game to
remember your true nature.

00:31:38.960 --> 00:31:40.973 align:middle line:84%
So you have two
operating systems.

00:31:40.973 --> 00:31:42.640 align:middle line:84%
You have the operating
system of the ego

00:31:42.640 --> 00:31:45.880 align:middle line:84%
mind, which holds the
programs of lack limitation

00:31:45.880 --> 00:31:47.520 align:middle line:90%
and separation.

00:31:47.520 --> 00:31:50.760 align:middle line:84%
And that was required,
because if you remembered

00:31:50.760 --> 00:31:52.890 align:middle line:84%
your divine nature
the whole time, then

00:31:52.890 --> 00:31:54.720 align:middle line:84%
you wouldn't really be
playing in the game.

00:31:54.720 --> 00:31:57.360 align:middle line:84%
So you have these
ego programs that

00:31:57.360 --> 00:32:00.967 align:middle line:84%
get set up to allow you to
explore different limitations.

00:32:00.967 --> 00:32:02.550 align:middle line:84%
And then you have
the operating system

00:32:02.550 --> 00:32:05.100 align:middle line:84%
of the heart, which
allows you access

00:32:05.100 --> 00:32:08.535 align:middle line:84%
to multidimensional information
and your true divine nature.

00:32:08.535 --> 00:32:11.160 align:middle line:84%
So when you are present, you are
operating in the heart center.

00:32:11.160 --> 00:32:13.243 align:middle line:84%
When you are in the heart
center, you are present.

00:32:13.243 --> 00:32:14.650 align:middle line:90%
They are one in the same.

00:32:14.650 --> 00:32:18.120 align:middle line:84%
So when you are finding
that you are fatigued,

00:32:18.120 --> 00:32:20.710 align:middle line:84%
that you are feeling
worn out by the news,

00:32:20.710 --> 00:32:23.190 align:middle line:84%
it's all about coming back
to the heart-centered space.

00:32:23.190 --> 00:32:27.240 align:middle line:84%
Because most of what
you are experiencing,

00:32:27.240 --> 00:32:30.600 align:middle line:84%
for the majority of the world,
not for everyone but for most

00:32:30.600 --> 00:32:33.600 align:middle line:84%
people, it's just a story
that you're telling yourself.

00:32:33.600 --> 00:32:36.240 align:middle line:84%
You are not in imminent
danger in this moment.

00:32:36.240 --> 00:32:38.460 align:middle line:84%
There are not bombs
being dropped on you.

00:32:38.460 --> 00:32:40.440 align:middle line:84%
But you may have so
much fear about that

00:32:40.440 --> 00:32:42.430 align:middle line:90%
that that becomes your story.

00:32:42.430 --> 00:32:45.810 align:middle line:84%
And so when you go back into
the heart-centered space,

00:32:45.810 --> 00:32:48.605 align:middle line:90%
you increase your resonance.

00:32:48.605 --> 00:32:50.480 align:middle line:84%
In order to get to that
heart-centered space,

00:32:50.480 --> 00:32:52.550 align:middle line:84%
you have to increase
your resonance.

00:32:52.550 --> 00:32:55.580 align:middle line:84%
And it's not nothing that
you have to learn how to do.

00:32:55.580 --> 00:32:57.830 align:middle line:84%
Simply think of something
that makes you smile.

00:32:57.830 --> 00:32:58.850 align:middle line:90%
And you are there.

00:32:58.850 --> 00:33:00.500 align:middle line:90%
It is your natural state.

00:33:00.500 --> 00:33:02.210 align:middle line:84%
And then you can
start to access what

00:33:02.210 --> 00:33:04.210 align:middle line:84%
we call the high mind,
which is more pure logic.

00:33:04.210 --> 00:33:05.010 align:middle line:90%
All right?

00:33:05.010 --> 00:33:07.250 align:middle line:84%
You can see things from
a very logical stance.

00:33:07.250 --> 00:33:10.490 align:middle line:84%
But that is only accessed
through the heart center.

00:33:10.490 --> 00:33:14.870 align:middle line:84%
And your challenges
simply go away

00:33:14.870 --> 00:33:17.900 align:middle line:84%
for the most part, when you put
yourself into the heart center,

00:33:17.900 --> 00:33:20.330 align:middle line:84%
because as we said, most
of those are just stories.

00:33:20.330 --> 00:33:22.640 align:middle line:84%
And when you're not
running those programs that

00:33:22.640 --> 00:33:24.290 align:middle line:84%
say I've got this
problem, you're

00:33:24.290 --> 00:33:26.450 align:middle line:84%
elevating your awareness
higher than that.

00:33:26.450 --> 00:33:29.130 align:middle line:84%
Then you see solutions,
if they need to exist.

00:33:29.130 --> 00:33:31.140 align:middle line:84%
Some of those problems
just go away altogether.

00:33:31.140 --> 00:33:33.650 align:middle line:84%
But if there is a
solution that is required,

00:33:33.650 --> 00:33:35.780 align:middle line:84%
then you will see the action
that needs to be taken

00:33:35.780 --> 00:33:38.120 align:middle line:84%
or the shift in
awareness or perception

00:33:38.120 --> 00:33:39.510 align:middle line:90%
that needs to happen.

00:33:39.510 --> 00:33:43.010 align:middle line:84%
So the moment that you go back
into the heart-centered space,

00:33:43.010 --> 00:33:46.130 align:middle line:84%
you also move out of
that fight or flight

00:33:46.130 --> 00:33:49.300 align:middle line:84%
and you move back into that
parasympathetic nervous system.

00:33:49.300 --> 00:33:51.090 align:middle line:84%
So the body starts
producing chemicals

00:33:51.090 --> 00:33:55.890 align:middle line:84%
that help the body to repair
itself to regenerate itself.

00:33:55.890 --> 00:33:57.640 align:middle line:84%
The problem is you
don't stay there.

00:33:57.640 --> 00:34:00.100 align:middle line:84%
And this is why, we say you
have to have a practice.

00:34:00.100 --> 00:34:01.680 align:middle line:84%
And the practice
can be something

00:34:01.680 --> 00:34:04.560 align:middle line:84%
as simple as setting an alarm
once an hour for yourself

00:34:04.560 --> 00:34:06.270 align:middle line:84%
to check in, where
am I vibrating?

00:34:06.270 --> 00:34:07.380 align:middle line:90%
What's going on here?

00:34:07.380 --> 00:34:09.690 align:middle line:84%
Do I need to make a
course correction?

00:34:09.690 --> 00:34:12.360 align:middle line:84%
You can pick a frequency when
you wake up in the morning

00:34:12.360 --> 00:34:14.250 align:middle line:84%
to say, today I want
to explore peace

00:34:14.250 --> 00:34:17.310 align:middle line:90%
or today I want to explore joy.

00:34:17.310 --> 00:34:20.699 align:middle line:84%
And so you keep imagining this
frequency throughout the day.

00:34:20.699 --> 00:34:22.080 align:middle line:90%
You can say, I am joyful.

00:34:22.080 --> 00:34:23.760 align:middle line:84%
But for most of
you, you might find

00:34:23.760 --> 00:34:26.863 align:middle line:84%
that the inner critic gets a
little busy in saying, well,

00:34:26.863 --> 00:34:27.780 align:middle line:90%
that's a nice thought.

00:34:27.780 --> 00:34:29.280 align:middle line:90%
But not so much right now.

00:34:29.280 --> 00:34:30.540 align:middle line:90%
I'm not really feeling joyful.

00:34:30.540 --> 00:34:32.889 align:middle line:84%
I've got this problem
and that problem.

00:34:32.889 --> 00:34:35.790 align:middle line:84%
But if you say, I wonder
what joy would feel like.

00:34:35.790 --> 00:34:38.460 align:middle line:84%
What would it feel like
in my body to be joyful?

00:34:38.460 --> 00:34:40.800 align:middle line:84%
It doesn't matter
whether you say I am

00:34:40.800 --> 00:34:43.610 align:middle line:84%
or if I wonder what
it would be like.

00:34:43.610 --> 00:34:46.199 align:middle line:84%
You will access
the same frequency.

00:34:46.199 --> 00:34:48.739 align:middle line:84%
So as you start
to imagine it, you

00:34:48.739 --> 00:34:50.510 align:middle line:84%
start to pulse it
out consciously.

00:34:50.510 --> 00:34:53.389 align:middle line:84%
Now, that signal
consciously is far stronger

00:34:53.389 --> 00:34:57.030 align:middle line:84%
than the subtle subconscious
waves that are going out,

00:34:57.030 --> 00:35:00.180 align:middle line:84%
which is the default of your
reality that is created.

00:35:00.180 --> 00:35:02.330 align:middle line:84%
So as you consciously
direct it, it

00:35:02.330 --> 00:35:04.280 align:middle line:84%
starts to be
reflected back to you

00:35:04.280 --> 00:35:05.640 align:middle line:90%
as the mirror for your reality.

00:35:05.640 --> 00:35:08.870 align:middle line:84%
You will see more
joy around you.

00:35:08.870 --> 00:35:10.790 align:middle line:84%
You will have more
experiences that

00:35:10.790 --> 00:35:13.580 align:middle line:84%
allow you to reinforce
the frequency of joy

00:35:13.580 --> 00:35:15.360 align:middle line:90%
that you are experiencing.

00:35:15.360 --> 00:35:17.900 align:middle line:84%
So keep checking in throughout
the day to say, all right.

00:35:17.900 --> 00:35:19.320 align:middle line:90%
Am I feeling joyful right now?

00:35:19.320 --> 00:35:21.080 align:middle line:84%
Well, probably not
so much right now.

00:35:21.080 --> 00:35:22.880 align:middle line:84%
I just had this
conversation with my boss

00:35:22.880 --> 00:35:24.090 align:middle line:90%
that didn't go well.

00:35:24.090 --> 00:35:27.840 align:middle line:84%
So take a moment,
re-imagine, reset yourself.

00:35:27.840 --> 00:35:31.010 align:middle line:84%
And so this is how
you alter your energy,

00:35:31.010 --> 00:35:33.620 align:middle line:84%
you alter your
frequency to elevate,

00:35:33.620 --> 00:35:36.680 align:middle line:84%
to access better
health, better vitality.

00:35:36.680 --> 00:35:38.420 align:middle line:90%
Inspiration.

00:35:38.420 --> 00:35:41.690 align:middle line:84%
To start to consciously
direct and manifest the way

00:35:41.690 --> 00:35:42.710 align:middle line:90%
that you wish.

00:35:42.710 --> 00:35:44.210 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: That's very useful.

00:35:44.210 --> 00:35:45.010 align:middle line:90%
Very helpful.

00:35:45.010 --> 00:35:45.810 align:middle line:90%
Thank you.

00:35:45.810 --> 00:35:49.140 align:middle line:84%
So for any one of us, depending
on what we most relate

00:35:49.140 --> 00:35:52.800 align:middle line:84%
to of the virtues,
perhaps it's kindness

00:35:52.800 --> 00:35:55.170 align:middle line:84%
or generosity or
gratitude, any one

00:35:55.170 --> 00:35:58.770 align:middle line:84%
of these that make us feel
good and warm inside ourselves,

00:35:58.770 --> 00:36:01.880 align:middle line:84%
well, any one of those do as an
access point then to the heart.

00:36:01.880 --> 00:36:04.380 align:middle line:84%
>> KENNEDY: Well, we would say
think of something that makes

00:36:04.380 --> 00:36:05.180 align:middle line:90%
you smile.

00:36:05.180 --> 00:36:08.490 align:middle line:84%
Because typically, what
you will access with that

00:36:08.490 --> 00:36:09.990 align:middle line:90%
is a higher resonance.

00:36:09.990 --> 00:36:13.800 align:middle line:84%
Joy is not quite as
high as gratitude,

00:36:13.800 --> 00:36:15.360 align:middle line:84%
all right, on the
vibrational scale.

00:36:15.360 --> 00:36:17.763 align:middle line:90%
So gratitude, compassion--

00:36:17.763 --> 00:36:18.930 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Compassion, yeah.

00:36:18.930 --> 00:36:22.620 align:middle line:84%
>> KENNEDY: --is another
one that you can focus on.

00:36:22.620 --> 00:36:27.360 align:middle line:84%
But really, for most of you,
the fastest thing for you to do

00:36:27.360 --> 00:36:28.920 align:middle line:90%
is to just simply imagine that.

00:36:28.920 --> 00:36:32.690 align:middle line:84%
And you do, when you imagine
something that makes you smile,

00:36:32.690 --> 00:36:34.440 align:middle line:84%
you'll notice that
your energy will shift.

00:36:34.440 --> 00:36:35.700 align:middle line:90%
And it's subtle.

00:36:35.700 --> 00:36:39.960 align:middle line:84%
It's not like the heavens open
and a booming voice comes down

00:36:39.960 --> 00:36:41.880 align:middle line:84%
to give you information
necessarily.

00:36:41.880 --> 00:36:43.200 align:middle line:90%
Occasionally, that happens.

00:36:43.200 --> 00:36:46.380 align:middle line:84%
But typically, it's
just a subtle opening.

00:36:46.380 --> 00:36:49.410 align:middle line:84%
And you might notice that
you feel a little lighter.

00:36:49.410 --> 00:36:52.950 align:middle line:84%
You might tingle a bit as new
energy comes into the body.

00:36:52.950 --> 00:36:54.880 align:middle line:84%
It doesn't take long
for you to get there.

00:36:54.880 --> 00:36:56.910 align:middle line:84%
But the problem is,
you don't stay there.

00:36:56.910 --> 00:36:59.250 align:middle line:84%
The ego mind, the
subconscious programs

00:36:59.250 --> 00:37:01.140 align:middle line:84%
will get triggered up
throughout the day.

00:37:01.140 --> 00:37:04.140 align:middle line:84%
So you're up, you drop
out, you reset yourself,

00:37:04.140 --> 00:37:05.590 align:middle line:90%
you go back up again.

00:37:05.590 --> 00:37:08.550 align:middle line:84%
And hopefully, every time you
go up, you stay a little longer.

00:37:08.550 --> 00:37:11.190 align:middle line:84%
And every time you drop
out, you don't drop as far.

00:37:11.190 --> 00:37:14.400 align:middle line:90%
So it is a cumulative process.

00:37:14.400 --> 00:37:19.920 align:middle line:84%
And you'll find that once you
start, it feels much better

00:37:19.920 --> 00:37:21.870 align:middle line:84%
and you want to
stay in that energy.

00:37:21.870 --> 00:37:22.860 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Absolutely.

00:37:22.860 --> 00:37:25.050 align:middle line:84%
And like any other
habit we've created,

00:37:25.050 --> 00:37:28.440 align:middle line:84%
it's really creating it
in a habitual way where

00:37:28.440 --> 00:37:31.770 align:middle line:84%
we keep revisiting, revisiting
until actually it just becomes

00:37:31.770 --> 00:37:33.460 align:middle line:90%
our dominant set, right?

00:37:33.460 --> 00:37:34.260 align:middle line:90%
>> KENNEDY: Yes.

00:37:34.260 --> 00:37:34.710 align:middle line:90%
Exactly.

00:37:34.710 --> 00:37:36.377 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: So any one
of us can do this.

00:37:36.377 --> 00:37:37.840 align:middle line:84%
And I thank you
very much for that.

00:37:37.840 --> 00:37:40.530 align:middle line:84%
It's very useful, very
practical information.

00:37:40.530 --> 00:37:44.910 align:middle line:84%
Before we go back to Wendy
and then have her channel

00:37:44.910 --> 00:37:47.220 align:middle line:84%
a little bit of
the light language,

00:37:47.220 --> 00:37:50.880 align:middle line:84%
is there anything else that's
really important for us

00:37:50.880 --> 00:37:51.965 align:middle line:90%
to know this very moment?

00:37:51.965 --> 00:37:55.080 align:middle line:84%
>> KENNEDY: So oftentimes, you
all feel a bit overwhelmed when

00:37:55.080 --> 00:37:57.570 align:middle line:84%
you're looking at the condition
of the world today and you

00:37:57.570 --> 00:37:59.670 align:middle line:84%
think, how in the world
can I make a difference?

00:37:59.670 --> 00:38:01.330 align:middle line:90%
How is this going to change?

00:38:01.330 --> 00:38:03.670 align:middle line:90%
I don't see a way out.

00:38:03.670 --> 00:38:06.010 align:middle line:84%
Don't underestimate
your own power.

00:38:06.010 --> 00:38:09.280 align:middle line:84%
Put your energy and
focus into the things

00:38:09.280 --> 00:38:12.040 align:middle line:84%
that you want to see
created in the world.

00:38:12.040 --> 00:38:16.210 align:middle line:84%
Maybe you don't know how
to generate that yourself

00:38:16.210 --> 00:38:19.060 align:middle line:84%
in this moment, but open
up to that possibility

00:38:19.060 --> 00:38:21.610 align:middle line:84%
that maybe you can lend
your energy to a group

00:38:21.610 --> 00:38:26.800 align:middle line:84%
or maybe you can start
a new organization that

00:38:26.800 --> 00:38:28.510 align:middle line:84%
will support people
in the way that you

00:38:28.510 --> 00:38:30.040 align:middle line:90%
would like to see that happen.

00:38:30.040 --> 00:38:33.670 align:middle line:84%
Because really, this
is a house of cards.

00:38:33.670 --> 00:38:35.380 align:middle line:84%
And those at the
top don't want you

00:38:35.380 --> 00:38:38.320 align:middle line:84%
to realize that when you
stop running and putting

00:38:38.320 --> 00:38:42.540 align:middle line:84%
your energy into
their programming,

00:38:42.540 --> 00:38:47.340 align:middle line:84%
into their systems, you are
pulling out those bottom cards

00:38:47.340 --> 00:38:50.250 align:middle line:84%
and the entire house
will come crumbling down.

00:38:50.250 --> 00:38:52.150 align:middle line:84%
This is the state
that you're in.

00:38:52.150 --> 00:38:54.707 align:middle line:84%
So really think about
what it is that you want.

00:38:54.707 --> 00:38:56.790 align:middle line:84%
And when you think about
what it is that you want,

00:38:56.790 --> 00:38:58.740 align:middle line:84%
focus on the frequency,
not the form.

00:38:58.740 --> 00:39:01.500 align:middle line:84%
The form is not your job in
the process of manifestation.

00:39:01.500 --> 00:39:02.890 align:middle line:90%
That's up to the universe.

00:39:02.890 --> 00:39:05.580 align:middle line:84%
It puts the right
people together

00:39:05.580 --> 00:39:09.960 align:middle line:84%
to create the right kind
of physical circumstance.

00:39:09.960 --> 00:39:12.480 align:middle line:84%
And for you it's
about frequency.

00:39:12.480 --> 00:39:15.910 align:middle line:84%
What frequencies do you want
to hold throughout your day?

00:39:15.910 --> 00:39:18.630 align:middle line:84%
Maybe you want a job,
maybe that means for you,

00:39:18.630 --> 00:39:20.670 align:middle line:84%
you want to be
creative or you want

00:39:20.670 --> 00:39:23.070 align:middle line:84%
to have people who laugh
and have a good time

00:39:23.070 --> 00:39:25.600 align:middle line:84%
while they're at work or
maybe you want flexibility

00:39:25.600 --> 00:39:27.850 align:middle line:84%
or maybe you're somebody who
needs a lot of structure.

00:39:27.850 --> 00:39:29.350 align:middle line:84%
You want to go 9:00
to 5:00 and then

00:39:29.350 --> 00:39:32.040 align:middle line:84%
you want things
to do on your own.

00:39:32.040 --> 00:39:35.460 align:middle line:84%
It's all creating it
based on frequency

00:39:35.460 --> 00:39:37.830 align:middle line:84%
and it doesn't matter
whether it is a relationship

00:39:37.830 --> 00:39:42.830 align:middle line:84%
that you want to call in, a
career or hobbies, experiences.

00:39:42.830 --> 00:39:43.630 align:middle line:90%
It doesn't matter.

00:39:43.630 --> 00:39:45.460 align:middle line:84%
Focus on the frequency
and the universe

00:39:45.460 --> 00:39:46.690 align:middle line:90%
will bring you the form.

00:39:46.690 --> 00:39:48.430 align:middle line:84%
Because chances are,
the form is going

00:39:48.430 --> 00:39:51.040 align:middle line:84%
to be bigger and
better than anything

00:39:51.040 --> 00:39:52.940 align:middle line:90%
that you could possibly imagine.

00:39:52.940 --> 00:39:56.600 align:middle line:84%
So as you are focused on the
frequency, what will happen

00:39:56.600 --> 00:39:59.240 align:middle line:84%
is that you will notice
it being reflected

00:39:59.240 --> 00:40:00.260 align:middle line:90%
in your external world.

00:40:00.260 --> 00:40:02.765 align:middle line:84%
You'll say, there is
something about that.

00:40:02.765 --> 00:40:05.630 align:middle line:84%
I would never think to go
and interview for a job

00:40:05.630 --> 00:40:08.160 align:middle line:84%
with this kind of company,
but I'm drawn to it.

00:40:08.160 --> 00:40:09.560 align:middle line:90%
So I'm going to go.

00:40:09.560 --> 00:40:13.160 align:middle line:84%
And you go and it's this
amazing opportunity.

00:40:13.160 --> 00:40:15.530 align:middle line:84%
But you would never
have thought about it.

00:40:15.530 --> 00:40:18.180 align:middle line:84%
It had you focused
solely on the form.

00:40:18.180 --> 00:40:18.980 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Yes.

00:40:18.980 --> 00:40:20.100 align:middle line:90%
That makes total sense.

00:40:20.100 --> 00:40:22.250 align:middle line:84%
So really, stay in
our feel good spot,

00:40:22.250 --> 00:40:24.200 align:middle line:84%
stay in the place
of whatever it is

00:40:24.200 --> 00:40:26.630 align:middle line:84%
we're focusing on, the
thing that uplifts and makes

00:40:26.630 --> 00:40:27.635 align:middle line:90%
us smile inside.

00:40:27.635 --> 00:40:28.550 align:middle line:90%
>> KENNEDY: Yes.

00:40:28.550 --> 00:40:30.980 align:middle line:84%
But also the last thing
we do want to say here

00:40:30.980 --> 00:40:35.480 align:middle line:84%
is don't deny the heavy
feelings that you have.

00:40:35.480 --> 00:40:38.090 align:middle line:84%
It is important that you give
yourself permission to feel,

00:40:38.090 --> 00:40:40.070 align:middle line:84%
because otherwise, it gets
stuffed and stuffed and stuff

00:40:40.070 --> 00:40:42.320 align:middle line:84%
and then it's just going to
explode out at some point.

00:40:42.320 --> 00:40:44.838 align:middle line:84%
So the fastest way
to process the energy

00:40:44.838 --> 00:40:46.880 align:middle line:84%
that you may be feeling,
if you're feeling heavy,

00:40:46.880 --> 00:40:50.090 align:middle line:84%
is to just observe
it without judgment.

00:40:50.090 --> 00:40:51.500 align:middle line:90%
Where does this sit in my body?

00:40:51.500 --> 00:40:51.980 align:middle line:90%
Anger.

00:40:51.980 --> 00:40:53.300 align:middle line:90%
Where is it sitting right now?

00:40:53.300 --> 00:40:54.890 align:middle line:90%
How does it feel?

00:40:54.890 --> 00:40:58.510 align:middle line:84%
I feel tense, my
muscles are all tight.

00:40:58.510 --> 00:41:00.570 align:middle line:90%
I feel hot.

00:41:00.570 --> 00:41:01.590 align:middle line:90%
What's happening?

00:41:01.590 --> 00:41:04.390 align:middle line:84%
Are you hot, cold,
tense, relaxed?

00:41:04.390 --> 00:41:05.880 align:middle line:90%
Are you buzzing, are you numb?

00:41:05.880 --> 00:41:07.180 align:middle line:90%
And then what emotion is it?

00:41:07.180 --> 00:41:09.270 align:middle line:90%
You can give it a name.

00:41:09.270 --> 00:41:11.963 align:middle line:84%
Anger is different than
frustration or than rage.

00:41:11.963 --> 00:41:13.380 align:middle line:84%
And what's the
quality of thought?

00:41:13.380 --> 00:41:16.570 align:middle line:84%
Are the thoughts positive
or are they negative?

00:41:16.570 --> 00:41:19.260 align:middle line:84%
It may be that you are
just quiet, observing.

00:41:19.260 --> 00:41:21.750 align:middle line:84%
And as you simply
observe without getting

00:41:21.750 --> 00:41:25.620 align:middle line:84%
lost in the story of why
you are in that experience,

00:41:25.620 --> 00:41:29.130 align:middle line:84%
you open a gateway for that
frequency to continue flowing,

00:41:29.130 --> 00:41:32.100 align:middle line:84%
because when you don't
like how something feels,

00:41:32.100 --> 00:41:34.740 align:middle line:84%
you stop the flow
of that energy.

00:41:34.740 --> 00:41:37.180 align:middle line:84%
It was meant to flow in
and flow right back out.

00:41:37.180 --> 00:41:39.310 align:middle line:84%
So it's building and
building and building.

00:41:39.310 --> 00:41:41.643 align:middle line:84%
It doesn't matter whether you
had an experience when you

00:41:41.643 --> 00:41:43.470 align:middle line:90%
were three months old or 55.

00:41:43.470 --> 00:41:47.010 align:middle line:84%
When you allow that opening to
happen through the observance,

00:41:47.010 --> 00:41:49.170 align:middle line:84%
all of that energy
flows once again.

00:41:49.170 --> 00:41:51.810 align:middle line:84%
So that is one of
the fastest ways

00:41:51.810 --> 00:41:52.950 align:middle line:90%
to process through emotion.

00:41:52.950 --> 00:41:55.920 align:middle line:84%
And really, you can only
hold it for about 45 seconds.

00:41:55.920 --> 00:41:57.670 align:middle line:84%
If you're holding it
any longer than that,

00:41:57.670 --> 00:41:58.980 align:middle line:84%
then you're probably
getting lost in the story.

00:41:58.980 --> 00:41:59.670 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Yep.

00:41:59.670 --> 00:42:00.300 align:middle line:90%
Very good.

00:42:00.300 --> 00:42:01.100 align:middle line:90%
Very true.

00:42:01.100 --> 00:42:02.440 align:middle line:90%
Thank you so much for that.

00:42:02.440 --> 00:42:04.690 align:middle line:84%
And thank you for everything
you shared with us today.

00:42:04.690 --> 00:42:05.520 align:middle line:90%
The time has flown.

00:42:05.520 --> 00:42:07.240 align:middle line:90%
So go well.

00:42:07.240 --> 00:42:08.700 align:middle line:84%
And we'll come
back to Wendy now.

00:42:08.700 --> 00:42:10.770 align:middle line:84%
Do a little bit of
the language of light.

00:42:10.770 --> 00:42:12.632 align:middle line:90%
Thank you.

00:42:12.632 --> 00:42:15.910 align:middle line:10%
>> KENNEDY: So I'm going
to let them take the lead

00:42:15.910 --> 00:42:17.410 align:middle line:10%
on the language
of light, I think.

00:42:17.410 --> 00:42:22.750 align:middle line:84%
And this activation is for
a sense of peace and hope

00:42:22.750 --> 00:42:25.595 align:middle line:84%
and to help you to
envision reality.

00:42:25.595 --> 00:42:27.345 align:middle line:84%
What's the new reality
going to look like?

00:42:27.345 --> 00:42:27.700 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: OK.

00:42:27.700 --> 00:42:28.540 align:middle line:90%
Everybody hold on.

00:42:28.540 --> 00:42:29.340 align:middle line:90%
Here it comes.

00:42:29.340 --> 00:42:32.122 align:middle line:90%


00:42:32.122 --> 00:42:34.200 align:middle line:90%
>> KENNEDY: [NON-ENGLISH]

00:42:34.200 --> 00:43:13.730 align:middle line:90%


00:43:13.730 --> 00:43:15.280 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Thank you, Wendy.

00:43:15.280 --> 00:43:17.260 align:middle line:90%
Thank you, P's.

00:43:17.260 --> 00:43:18.220 align:middle line:90%
It's so wild.

00:43:18.220 --> 00:43:19.570 align:middle line:90%
I've heard it before.

00:43:19.570 --> 00:43:23.050 align:middle line:84%
And it's like impossible
to recreate yourself.

00:43:23.050 --> 00:43:26.470 align:middle line:84%
And it's a very powerful
feeling that washes over you

00:43:26.470 --> 00:43:27.400 align:middle line:90%
when you hear it.

00:43:27.400 --> 00:43:28.280 align:middle line:90%
>> KENNEDY: Yeah.

00:43:28.280 --> 00:43:29.080 align:middle line:90%
It's amazing.

00:43:29.080 --> 00:43:31.780 align:middle line:10%
They describe it as this
piece of spiritual technology.

00:43:31.780 --> 00:43:34.060 align:middle line:10%
It helps us define the
frequency within ourselves.

00:43:34.060 --> 00:43:35.810 align:middle line:10%
It's just kind of a
reminder like somebody

00:43:35.810 --> 00:43:38.230 align:middle line:10%
playing a note on a piano so
you can sing that note of C.

00:43:38.230 --> 00:43:40.100 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: Well, thank
you for sharing that.

00:43:40.100 --> 00:43:41.850 align:middle line:84%
And thank you for
sharing everything else.

00:43:41.850 --> 00:43:44.350 align:middle line:84%
And yourself and allowing
yourself to be a channel today.

00:43:44.350 --> 00:43:46.145 align:middle line:84%
I'm sure we'll be
seeing you back here.

00:43:46.145 --> 00:43:47.395 align:middle line:90%
>> KENNEDY: Thank you so much.

00:43:47.395 --> 00:43:49.610 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: Some wonderful
food for thought.

00:43:49.610 --> 00:43:51.610 align:middle line:10%
Now, if you'd like to get
a hold of Wendy's work

00:43:51.610 --> 00:43:53.020 align:middle line:10%
