>>REGINA MEREDITH: As
a species, humanity

00:00:29.720 --> 00:00:31.850 align:middle line:10%
has come to some
critical decisions.

00:00:31.850 --> 00:00:35.050 align:middle line:10%
One is how far we're willing
to go to lengthen our lives

00:00:35.050 --> 00:00:36.330 align:middle line:10%
and retain youth.

00:00:36.330 --> 00:00:38.580 align:middle line:84%
I'm speaking about the
technological interface

00:00:38.580 --> 00:00:42.710 align:middle line:84%
between human and inorganic
technology, transhumanism.

00:00:42.710 --> 00:00:45.440 align:middle line:84%
William Henry is here with us
today to share his evidence

00:00:45.440 --> 00:00:48.510 align:middle line:84%
that this potential was
known of in ancient times

00:00:48.510 --> 00:00:51.070 align:middle line:84%
and even referenced in
the Bible, but in the end,

00:00:51.070 --> 00:00:53.430 align:middle line:90%
we must make our own decisions.

00:00:53.430 --> 00:00:55.630 align:middle line:10%
That's what the
book says, right?

00:00:55.630 --> 00:00:57.380 align:middle line:10%
>>WILLIAM HENRY: That's
right, absolutely.

00:00:57.380 --> 00:00:59.380 align:middle line:10%
>>REGINA: "The
Skingularity is Near"

00:00:59.380 --> 00:01:02.250 align:middle line:10%
but we need to talk
about this for a moment

00:01:02.250 --> 00:01:05.510 align:middle line:10%
because much ado has been
made about this book, which

00:01:05.510 --> 00:01:07.590 align:middle line:10%
you-- it's free.

00:01:07.590 --> 00:01:09.540 align:middle line:90%
It's a download off your site.

00:01:09.540 --> 00:01:13.010 align:middle line:84%
But in the community at large
and everything catches fire

00:01:13.010 --> 00:01:16.180 align:middle line:84%
in the conspiracy community,
people made comment on it

00:01:16.180 --> 00:01:17.850 align:middle line:84%
before they actually
read it and didn't

00:01:17.850 --> 00:01:20.280 align:middle line:84%
know where you were
coming from and this

00:01:20.280 --> 00:01:23.610 align:middle line:90%
has been uncomfortable.

00:01:23.610 --> 00:01:26.130 align:middle line:84%
>>HENRY: Well, it's created
a kind of a kerfuffle.

00:01:26.130 --> 00:01:28.500 align:middle line:10%
>>REGINA: A kerfuffle, yes.

00:01:28.500 --> 00:01:31.070 align:middle line:10%
>>HENRY: Where, people, they
think-- they're automatically

00:01:31.070 --> 00:01:34.059 align:middle line:10%
terrified of the subject
because they're not

00:01:34.059 --> 00:01:35.100 align:middle line:10%
empowered with knowledge.

00:01:35.100 --> 00:01:37.790 align:middle line:84%
And what I tried to do with my
book "The Skingularity is Near"

00:01:37.790 --> 00:01:40.760 align:middle line:84%
is to say, here is drawn
from the headlines,

00:01:40.760 --> 00:01:42.550 align:middle line:84%
drawn from corporate
reports, here

00:01:42.550 --> 00:01:44.310 align:middle line:90%
is where we are going with this.

00:01:44.310 --> 00:01:46.070 align:middle line:84%
This is what is
happening today and here

00:01:46.070 --> 00:01:48.430 align:middle line:84%
is the trajectory
of it, without me

00:01:48.430 --> 00:01:50.730 align:middle line:84%
trying to interject my
own personal view on it.

00:01:50.730 --> 00:01:55.004 align:middle line:84%
My goal was to educate,
to give it 110 pages.

00:01:55.004 --> 00:01:57.170 align:middle line:84%
If you can spend a half
hour or an hour sitting down

00:01:57.170 --> 00:01:58.930 align:middle line:84%
looking at this, you're going
to be up to speed on this issue.

00:01:58.930 --> 00:02:00.722 align:middle line:84%
But the problem
is a lot of people

00:02:00.722 --> 00:02:02.430 align:middle line:84%
that are commenting
on it and were coming

00:02:02.430 --> 00:02:04.870 align:middle line:90%
at me had not read my book.

00:02:04.870 --> 00:02:06.750 align:middle line:10%
And they were calling
me like, some kind

00:02:06.750 --> 00:02:08.840 align:middle line:10%
of an artificial
intelligence prophet, that I

00:02:08.840 --> 00:02:10.830 align:middle line:10%
was advocating transhumanism.

00:02:10.830 --> 00:02:13.380 align:middle line:84%
And I'm thinking, who
are they talking about?

00:02:13.380 --> 00:02:16.880 align:middle line:84%
Because the thing is, it's a
nuanced subject, is the thing.

00:02:16.880 --> 00:02:19.440 align:middle line:84%
And so I try to cover
both sides because who

00:02:19.440 --> 00:02:23.420 align:middle line:84%
am I to tell someone, you
can't have a pacemaker.

00:02:23.420 --> 00:02:25.795 align:middle line:84%
No, you can't have any kind
of augmentation to your body.

00:02:25.795 --> 00:02:27.294 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: We're
going to really talk

00:02:27.294 --> 00:02:29.310 align:middle line:84%
about this toward the
end of the interview.

00:02:29.310 --> 00:02:31.410 align:middle line:84%
I'll make sure we
have the time to look

00:02:31.410 --> 00:02:32.990 align:middle line:90%
at just how nuanced it is.

00:02:32.990 --> 00:02:36.600 align:middle line:84%
And unfortunately, when it
comes to really dramatic issues,

00:02:36.600 --> 00:02:39.867 align:middle line:84%
I think we have a very--
we have a nuanced audience

00:02:39.867 --> 00:02:41.200 align:middle line:90%
that we're talking to right now.

00:02:41.200 --> 00:02:44.200 align:middle line:84%
But oftentimes, there
isn't that in the thinking.

00:02:44.200 --> 00:02:48.160 align:middle line:84%
It's really looking for a
bow-tied answer or position

00:02:48.160 --> 00:02:50.650 align:middle line:84%
with some kind of guru
leading the way or someone

00:02:50.650 --> 00:02:51.510 align:middle line:90%
people admire.

00:02:51.510 --> 00:02:54.810 align:middle line:84%
And so there's really
no room in a lot

00:02:54.810 --> 00:03:00.020 align:middle line:84%
of subjects that have any charge
around it for an actual debate.

00:03:00.020 --> 00:03:01.256 align:middle line:90%
It doesn't really exist.

00:03:01.256 --> 00:03:02.630 align:middle line:84%
>>HENRY: But let
me say, I am not

00:03:02.630 --> 00:03:04.030 align:middle line:90%
an advocate of transhumanism.

00:03:04.030 --> 00:03:04.830 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: I know.

00:03:04.830 --> 00:03:06.780 align:middle line:84%
>>HENRY: I'm an advocate
of human potential

00:03:06.780 --> 00:03:09.010 align:middle line:84%
and especially,
spiritual potential.

00:03:09.010 --> 00:03:12.380 align:middle line:84%
And what I see is
that people are simply

00:03:12.380 --> 00:03:15.272 align:middle line:84%
unaware of how advanced
our technology is

00:03:15.272 --> 00:03:16.980 align:middle line:84%
and that the decisions
we're making today

00:03:16.980 --> 00:03:19.570 align:middle line:84%
will affect all
future generations.

00:03:19.570 --> 00:03:22.180 align:middle line:84%
Transhumanism, along
with globalism,

00:03:22.180 --> 00:03:24.940 align:middle line:84%
transnationalism are
entwined and they

00:03:24.940 --> 00:03:28.314 align:middle line:84%
are the two critical
issues of our present time.

00:03:28.314 --> 00:03:30.480 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Is that what drove
you to write this book?

00:03:30.480 --> 00:03:31.630 align:middle line:90%
>>HENRY: Yes, it is.

00:03:31.630 --> 00:03:33.100 align:middle line:90%
Well, I was also seeing--

00:03:33.100 --> 00:03:35.850 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Because you have an
interesting interface with it

00:03:35.850 --> 00:03:37.210 align:middle line:90%
from your other work.

00:03:37.210 --> 00:03:39.000 align:middle line:84%
So let's talk about
the whole inspiration.

00:03:39.000 --> 00:03:40.950 align:middle line:90%
How this examination came to be.

00:03:40.950 --> 00:03:43.830 align:middle line:84%
>>HENRY: In 2002, I was
writing my book "Cloak

00:03:43.830 --> 00:03:46.800 align:middle line:84%
of the Illuminati," which
was about this power cloak

00:03:46.800 --> 00:03:49.400 align:middle line:84%
or garment that was worn
by the ancient gods.

00:03:49.400 --> 00:03:51.040 align:middle line:90%
It gave them superhuman powers.

00:03:51.040 --> 00:03:52.650 align:middle line:90%
They could become invisible.

00:03:52.650 --> 00:03:56.290 align:middle line:84%
They could leap over
buildings, power of levitation.

00:03:56.290 --> 00:03:59.310 align:middle line:84%
And along the way, I learned
about a government conference

00:03:59.310 --> 00:04:02.300 align:middle line:84%
in Hawaii where the US
Government brought together

00:04:02.300 --> 00:04:06.650 align:middle line:84%
leading technologists for a
major conference on technology.

00:04:06.650 --> 00:04:09.480 align:middle line:84%
And the US Government
advocated then,

00:04:09.480 --> 00:04:13.890 align:middle line:84%
that four technologies were
going to merge into one.

00:04:13.890 --> 00:04:17.370 align:middle line:84%
These were bits, atoms,
neurons, and genes.

00:04:17.370 --> 00:04:21.500 align:middle line:84%
Computer technology,
nanotechnology, neuroscience,

00:04:21.500 --> 00:04:24.690 align:middle line:84%
and genetic technology, which
are separate disciplines.

00:04:24.690 --> 00:04:27.290 align:middle line:84%
But the US Government brought
these technologies together,

00:04:27.290 --> 00:04:29.210 align:middle line:84%
all the leading
companies, and said,

00:04:29.210 --> 00:04:33.360 align:middle line:84%
we want all of those to
become one seamless technology

00:04:33.360 --> 00:04:36.040 align:middle line:90%
that is aimed at the skin.

00:04:36.040 --> 00:04:39.290 align:middle line:84%
And along with it, they
also advocated the promotion

00:04:39.290 --> 00:04:42.320 align:middle line:84%
of the concept of the
hive mind, that they

00:04:42.320 --> 00:04:45.590 align:middle line:84%
were going to then be promoting
to the American people.

00:04:45.590 --> 00:04:50.040 align:middle line:84%
These technologies, bits,
atoms, neurons, and genes, BANG,

00:04:50.040 --> 00:04:54.540 align:middle line:84%
were aimed at the human skin,
according to this report.

00:04:54.540 --> 00:04:58.190 align:middle line:84%
And at this same time is
when MIT, the Massachusetts

00:04:58.190 --> 00:05:01.110 align:middle line:84%
Institute of Technology,
began developing

00:05:01.110 --> 00:05:05.220 align:middle line:84%
the new super soldier program
and the super soldier suit.

00:05:05.220 --> 00:05:06.644 align:middle line:90%
And I said, wait a minute.

00:05:06.644 --> 00:05:08.060 align:middle line:84%
MIT's saying, we're
going to build

00:05:08.060 --> 00:05:09.476 align:middle line:84%
a new skin for our
military that's

00:05:09.476 --> 00:05:11.666 align:middle line:84%
going to enable these guys
to leap over buildings.

00:05:11.666 --> 00:05:14.290 align:middle line:84%
They're going to be resistant to
ballistic and chemical attack.

00:05:14.290 --> 00:05:15.310 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: And disease.

00:05:15.310 --> 00:05:17.670 align:middle line:84%
>>HENRY: And disease and
they're going to be invisible.

00:05:17.670 --> 00:05:19.580 align:middle line:90%
And I'm like, wait a minute.

00:05:19.580 --> 00:05:21.400 align:middle line:84%
That's exactly the
same as the power

00:05:21.400 --> 00:05:24.700 align:middle line:84%
cloak that the Anunnaki
are said to have worn.

00:05:24.700 --> 00:05:28.610 align:middle line:84%
This transmittable power
garment that Elijah wore,

00:05:28.610 --> 00:05:30.930 align:middle line:84%
that he reclaimed
as John the Baptist,

00:05:30.930 --> 00:05:32.970 align:middle line:90%
that he transmitted to Jesus.

00:05:32.970 --> 00:05:35.000 align:middle line:84%
It's like, wait a minute,
what's going on here?

00:05:35.000 --> 00:05:39.360 align:middle line:84%
This is a retooling of
this ancient concept.

00:05:39.360 --> 00:05:43.030 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: But one was
spiritually-induced and

00:05:43.030 --> 00:05:43.880 align:middle line:90%
organic.

00:05:43.880 --> 00:05:44.767 align:middle line:90%
>>HENRY: Exactly.

00:05:44.767 --> 00:05:45.850 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: This one is not.

00:05:45.850 --> 00:05:47.200 align:middle line:90%
>>HENRY: That is the difference.

00:05:47.200 --> 00:05:49.520 align:middle line:84%
In the ancient
world, this garment

00:05:49.520 --> 00:05:53.220 align:middle line:84%
was acquired through alchemy,
through the transmutation

00:05:53.220 --> 00:05:55.880 align:middle line:84%
of the elements, especially
the human element.

00:05:55.880 --> 00:05:57.890 align:middle line:84%
And to the alchemist,
our body is

00:05:57.890 --> 00:06:01.090 align:middle line:84%
composed of earth, air, fire,
and water, the four elements,

00:06:01.090 --> 00:06:03.310 align:middle line:90%
plus the fifth element, spirit.

00:06:03.310 --> 00:06:05.520 align:middle line:84%
And as I analyzed this, I
said, well, wait a minute.

00:06:05.520 --> 00:06:07.590 align:middle line:84%
Bits, atoms, neurons,
and genes, these

00:06:07.590 --> 00:06:11.320 align:middle line:84%
are digital versions of
earth, air, fire, and water.

00:06:11.320 --> 00:06:13.980 align:middle line:84%
What's missing in this
conversation in Silicon Valley

00:06:13.980 --> 00:06:14.937 align:middle line:90%
was spirit.

00:06:14.937 --> 00:06:16.270 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Spirit, consciousness.

00:06:16.270 --> 00:06:16.850 align:middle line:84%
>>HENRY: There's
nothing spiritual

00:06:16.850 --> 00:06:18.260 align:middle line:90%
or conscious about this at all.

00:06:18.260 --> 00:06:18.550 align:middle line:90%
Exactly.

00:06:18.550 --> 00:06:20.000 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: But they
would argue differently.

00:06:20.000 --> 00:06:21.375 align:middle line:84%
>>HENRY: You're
absolutely right.

00:06:21.375 --> 00:06:24.350 align:middle line:84%
Dr. Ray Kurzweil wrote a book
called "The Singularity is

00:06:24.350 --> 00:06:27.260 align:middle line:84%
Near." he is Google's
technology guru

00:06:27.260 --> 00:06:30.040 align:middle line:84%
and he believes, as
did Steve Jobs of Apple

00:06:30.040 --> 00:06:34.200 align:middle line:84%
as well, that their mission
is to infuse technology

00:06:34.200 --> 00:06:35.000 align:middle line:90%
with spirit.

00:06:35.000 --> 00:06:39.400 align:middle line:84%
They believe that they
are perfecting God's work.

00:06:39.400 --> 00:06:42.744 align:middle line:84%
They view the human body
as imperfect, incomplete,

00:06:42.744 --> 00:06:44.077 align:middle line:90%
sort of like God baked the cake.

00:06:44.077 --> 00:06:44.454 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Vulnerable.

00:06:44.454 --> 00:06:45.830 align:middle line:90%
>>HENRY: Vulnerable, fragile.

00:06:45.830 --> 00:06:46.910 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: It expires.

00:06:46.910 --> 00:06:47.480 align:middle line:90%
>>HENRY: Yeah, it expires.

00:06:47.480 --> 00:06:49.130 align:middle line:84%
And they're saying, well,
OK, so God baked the cake.

00:06:49.130 --> 00:06:50.650 align:middle line:84%
We're going to put
the icing on it.

00:06:50.650 --> 00:06:52.400 align:middle line:84%
And then we're going
to freeze it in time.

00:06:52.400 --> 00:06:54.820 align:middle line:84%
So then it doesn't
age and it has

00:06:54.820 --> 00:06:57.730 align:middle line:84%
all these souped-up
capabilities as well.

00:06:57.730 --> 00:07:00.300 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: You know, just
when I was reading your book

00:07:00.300 --> 00:07:04.460 align:middle line:84%
and thinking about this, I
thought the exquisite nature

00:07:04.460 --> 00:07:06.300 align:middle line:90%
of the human body.

00:07:06.300 --> 00:07:09.980 align:middle line:84%
The ability of these
cells to essentially

00:07:09.980 --> 00:07:13.460 align:middle line:84%
be bathed in the ability
to exchange information,

00:07:13.460 --> 00:07:16.750 align:middle line:84%
not just with each other but
with the entire environment.

00:07:16.750 --> 00:07:20.330 align:middle line:84%
Not only our own universe but
with the sun and the planets

00:07:20.330 --> 00:07:24.190 align:middle line:84%
and everything, the animal
kingdom, the plant kingdom,

00:07:24.190 --> 00:07:25.920 align:middle line:90%
mineral kingdoms.

00:07:25.920 --> 00:07:30.470 align:middle line:84%
And to me, it seems to
be incredible arrogance

00:07:30.470 --> 00:07:33.150 align:middle line:84%
to think that they
can reverse engineer

00:07:33.150 --> 00:07:37.150 align:middle line:84%
that so it can actually house
that kind of consciousness.

00:07:37.150 --> 00:07:38.650 align:middle line:84%
>>HENRY: Well, and
here's the thing-

00:07:38.650 --> 00:07:40.560 align:middle line:84%
this is where it
gets kind of tricky-

00:07:40.560 --> 00:07:44.400 align:middle line:84%
is that this idea of
perfecting the human body

00:07:44.400 --> 00:07:45.592 align:middle line:90%
originates in Christianity.

00:07:45.592 --> 00:07:47.050 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Well,
and now we're going

00:07:47.050 --> 00:07:48.140 align:middle line:84%
to get into that
part of the story.

00:07:48.140 --> 00:07:49.080 align:middle line:90%
I have a ton of questions.

00:07:49.080 --> 00:07:49.970 align:middle line:84%
Why don't you
launch in and then,

00:07:49.970 --> 00:07:52.605 align:middle line:84%
I'm just going to augment what
you say with more questions.

00:07:52.605 --> 00:07:54.480 align:middle line:84%
>>HENRY: The traditional
Judeo-Christian view

00:07:54.480 --> 00:07:57.820 align:middle line:84%
is that Adam and Eve
dwelt in a perfect place.

00:07:57.820 --> 00:08:01.390 align:middle line:84%
The esoteric view says that
perfect place was on Earth

00:08:01.390 --> 00:08:04.640 align:middle line:84%
but we were not originally
in flesh and blood bodies.

00:08:04.640 --> 00:08:05.690 align:middle line:90%
We were light beings.

00:08:05.690 --> 00:08:08.100 align:middle line:90%
We are ephemeral light beings.

00:08:08.100 --> 00:08:11.880 align:middle line:84%
Then after the fall, when
we're evicted from Eden,

00:08:11.880 --> 00:08:15.410 align:middle line:84%
this is when the Old Testament
God Yahweh gives humans

00:08:15.410 --> 00:08:16.730 align:middle line:90%
coats of skin.

00:08:16.730 --> 00:08:17.530 align:middle line:90%
Traditional--

00:08:17.530 --> 00:08:19.230 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Vulnerable,
vulnerability.

00:08:19.230 --> 00:08:21.105 align:middle line:84%
>>HENRY: Exactly and
traditional Christianity

00:08:21.105 --> 00:08:23.930 align:middle line:84%
says the coats of skin might
have been animal skins,

00:08:23.930 --> 00:08:26.230 align:middle line:90%
like cow skin or lamb skin.

00:08:26.230 --> 00:08:30.845 align:middle line:84%
But the esoteric side of Judaism
says, no, it's human skin.

00:08:30.845 --> 00:08:32.720 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: They took on
masks, physical masks.

00:08:32.720 --> 00:08:36.440 align:middle line:84%
>>HENRY: Exactly and ever since
our eviction from Eden, that

00:08:36.440 --> 00:08:39.150 align:middle line:84%
fall, we've been
trying to reclaim

00:08:39.150 --> 00:08:44.210 align:middle line:84%
our original perfection,
so Christianity, Judaism

00:08:44.210 --> 00:08:47.281 align:middle line:84%
and Christianity are driven by
the idea that we're sinners.

00:08:47.281 --> 00:08:48.530 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: The fall from grace.

00:08:48.530 --> 00:08:51.240 align:middle line:84%
We're sinners and we
have to work our way back

00:08:51.240 --> 00:08:52.590 align:middle line:90%
into some state of perfection.

00:08:52.590 --> 00:08:53.965 align:middle line:84%
>>HENRY: Right
and to be a sinner

00:08:53.965 --> 00:08:56.220 align:middle line:84%
means you are not in your
light body, your glory

00:08:56.220 --> 00:08:57.900 align:middle line:90%
body, your resurrection body.

00:08:57.900 --> 00:09:00.420 align:middle line:84%
So for nearly 2,000
years, Christians

00:09:00.420 --> 00:09:04.280 align:middle line:84%
have been trying to
reclaim our original divine

00:09:04.280 --> 00:09:07.994 align:middle line:84%
light being status and this
is what drives transhumanism.

00:09:07.994 --> 00:09:10.160 align:middle line:84%
And this is the reason why
this technology comes out

00:09:10.160 --> 00:09:14.759 align:middle line:84%
of the West and not out of
China, Japan, Africa, India,

00:09:14.759 --> 00:09:16.300 align:middle line:84%
or any other place
because they don't

00:09:16.300 --> 00:09:18.800 align:middle line:90%
have this drive for perfection.

00:09:18.800 --> 00:09:21.670 align:middle line:84%
And so historically,
this really started

00:09:21.670 --> 00:09:24.245 align:middle line:90%
to ramp up in the Middle Ages.

00:09:24.245 --> 00:09:25.870 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And this
is based on the fact

00:09:25.870 --> 00:09:27.390 align:middle line:84%
there is no recognition
of the soul,

00:09:27.390 --> 00:09:28.540 align:middle line:90%
actually, in this process.

00:09:28.540 --> 00:09:30.400 align:middle line:90%
There's lip service to the word.

00:09:30.400 --> 00:09:33.021 align:middle line:84%
There is no recognition of
what that force even means.

00:09:33.021 --> 00:09:34.020 align:middle line:90%
>>HENRY: Right, exactly.

00:09:34.020 --> 00:09:37.660 align:middle line:84%
It's just all about reclaiming
our original perfection.

00:09:37.660 --> 00:09:38.647 align:middle line:90%
Exactly.

00:09:38.647 --> 00:09:40.230 align:middle line:84%
And so in the Middle
Ages, you started

00:09:40.230 --> 00:09:43.590 align:middle line:84%
to have monasteries led
by the Franciscans mostly,

00:09:43.590 --> 00:09:47.280 align:middle line:84%
that promoted the idea that
technology was a gift from God

00:09:47.280 --> 00:09:49.660 align:middle line:84%
because technology
gave us free time.

00:09:49.660 --> 00:09:50.730 align:middle line:90%
Free time to do what?

00:09:50.730 --> 00:09:52.120 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: We're talking
about plows, right?

00:09:52.120 --> 00:09:52.957 align:middle line:90%
>>HENRY: Exactly.

00:09:52.957 --> 00:09:55.290 align:middle line:84%
It was the invention of the
plow because before that, we

00:09:55.290 --> 00:09:57.248 align:middle line:84%
had to toil in the fields
for hours upon hours.

00:09:57.248 --> 00:09:59.000 align:middle line:84%
But when a plow was
invented that could

00:09:59.000 --> 00:10:02.550 align:middle line:84%
be pulled by multiple oxen,
now, all of a sudden, our output

00:10:02.550 --> 00:10:05.710 align:middle line:84%
went up dramatically, as did
our free time and our ability

00:10:05.710 --> 00:10:08.850 align:middle line:84%
to investigate,
meditate, whatever to try

00:10:08.850 --> 00:10:10.070 align:middle line:90%
to reclaim our perfection.

00:10:10.070 --> 00:10:12.640 align:middle line:84%
So this is where the idea
starts coming into play

00:10:12.640 --> 00:10:15.660 align:middle line:84%
that technology can actually
be good for us and is,

00:10:15.660 --> 00:10:17.250 align:middle line:90%
in fact, a gift from God.

00:10:17.250 --> 00:10:20.460 align:middle line:84%
The next major invention a
lot of people would argue

00:10:20.460 --> 00:10:22.450 align:middle line:84%
is the printing press
but it was actually

00:10:22.450 --> 00:10:25.350 align:middle line:84%
eyeglasses because
with eyeglasses

00:10:25.350 --> 00:10:28.132 align:middle line:84%
came this idea that we can
augment the human body--

00:10:28.132 --> 00:10:29.340 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Through technology.

00:10:29.340 --> 00:10:32.760 align:middle line:84%
>>HENRY: Through technology
and improve God's creation.

00:10:32.760 --> 00:10:35.600 align:middle line:84%
The Church's position would
have been, how dare you.

00:10:35.600 --> 00:10:37.740 align:middle line:10%
If God wanted you to
have a good set of eyes,

00:10:37.740 --> 00:10:39.910 align:middle line:10%
he would have given
you a good set of eyes?

00:10:39.910 --> 00:10:42.980 align:middle line:84%
Who are you to challenge
God's authority?

00:10:42.980 --> 00:10:46.707 align:middle line:84%
So that was an ethical argument
that went on for a long time.

00:10:46.707 --> 00:10:47.540 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Seriously?

00:10:47.540 --> 00:10:49.800 align:middle line:84%
>>HENRY: Seriously
and now, eyeglasses

00:10:49.800 --> 00:10:51.140 align:middle line:90%
are everywhere, right?

00:10:51.140 --> 00:10:53.865 align:middle line:84%
And now we're dramatically
way on down the line.

00:10:53.865 --> 00:10:54.990 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Corneal implants.

00:10:54.990 --> 00:10:56.100 align:middle line:90%
Yeah contact lenses.

00:10:56.100 --> 00:10:56.900 align:middle line:90%
>>HENRY: Exactly.

00:10:56.900 --> 00:10:58.990 align:middle line:84%
You know, Google's got
their new Magic Leap.

00:10:58.990 --> 00:11:01.240 align:middle line:84%
They put a billion
dollars-- you'll

00:11:01.240 --> 00:11:04.860 align:middle line:84%
go to Best Buy or something like
that, have your lens removed.

00:11:04.860 --> 00:11:07.660 align:middle line:84%
They'll poor a liquid
in your eye socket

00:11:07.660 --> 00:11:11.470 align:middle line:84%
that's loaded with electronics,
a battery, a radio,

00:11:11.470 --> 00:11:13.220 align:middle line:84%
and now you'll be able
to see in the dark.

00:11:13.220 --> 00:11:14.721 align:middle line:84%
You'll be able to
record video 24/7.

00:11:14.721 --> 00:11:16.303 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Certainly
better than 20/20.

00:11:16.303 --> 00:11:17.400 align:middle line:90%
>>HENRY: Oh, my gosh.

00:11:17.400 --> 00:11:18.200 align:middle line:90%
It's unreal.

00:11:18.200 --> 00:11:22.250 align:middle line:84%
But with this super vision
that we're going to get from

00:11:22.250 --> 00:11:24.027 align:middle line:90%
this comes supervision.

00:11:24.027 --> 00:11:24.860 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Absolutely

00:11:24.860 --> 00:11:25.390 align:middle line:90%
>>HENRY: Control.

00:11:25.390 --> 00:11:26.190 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Control.

00:11:26.190 --> 00:11:27.727 align:middle line:84%
Because this is
two-way technology.

00:11:27.727 --> 00:11:29.560 align:middle line:84%
>>HENRY: Totally and
that's the danger here.

00:11:29.560 --> 00:11:30.976 align:middle line:84%
So the question
then becomes where

00:11:30.976 --> 00:11:35.050 align:middle line:84%
is the line between augmenting
the body, wearing eyeglasses,

00:11:35.050 --> 00:11:38.760 align:middle line:84%
and retinal implants that
just completely get rid

00:11:38.760 --> 00:11:41.150 align:middle line:84%
of any iPhone, get rid
of your desktop computer?

00:11:41.150 --> 00:11:41.980 align:middle line:90%
That's their plan.

00:11:41.980 --> 00:11:43.900 align:middle line:84%
Is that it'll just
be in your eye.

00:11:43.900 --> 00:11:45.605 align:middle line:84%
And with their Magic
Leap technology,

00:11:45.605 --> 00:11:46.980 align:middle line:84%
Google says, OK,
what we're going

00:11:46.980 --> 00:11:50.250 align:middle line:84%
to do is you're going to
augment your reality now.

00:11:50.250 --> 00:11:51.910 align:middle line:84%
We're going to be
able to superimpose

00:11:51.910 --> 00:11:54.290 align:middle line:84%
any image we want
on this reality

00:11:54.290 --> 00:11:57.440 align:middle line:84%
through this lens
implanted in your retina.

00:11:57.440 --> 00:12:00.900 align:middle line:84%
So you won't ever have a desktop
computer after say, 2020.

00:12:00.900 --> 00:12:04.030 align:middle line:90%
It's all going to be implanted.

00:12:04.030 --> 00:12:05.742 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Will we have a choice?

00:12:05.742 --> 00:12:06.950 align:middle line:90%
>>HENRY: That's the question.

00:12:06.950 --> 00:12:08.590 align:middle line:90%
For now, we do have a choice.

00:12:08.590 --> 00:12:11.160 align:middle line:84%
But the danger is,
is that this is

00:12:11.160 --> 00:12:13.650 align:middle line:84%
going to be mandated,
that we're going

00:12:13.650 --> 00:12:16.540 align:middle line:84%
be start to seeing the real
teeth come out of things

00:12:16.540 --> 00:12:19.990 align:middle line:84%
like Obamacare and other
government programs that

00:12:19.990 --> 00:12:22.390 align:middle line:84%
mandate the implantation
of these chips.

00:12:22.390 --> 00:12:24.850 align:middle line:84%
Right now, all our
medical records, by law,

00:12:24.850 --> 00:12:26.890 align:middle line:90%
have to be digitized.

00:12:26.890 --> 00:12:30.360 align:middle line:84%
The next step is, is that they
are implanted in your body.

00:12:30.360 --> 00:12:33.230 align:middle line:84%
All these refugees, they all
are carrying biometric cards.

00:12:33.230 --> 00:12:34.980 align:middle line:84%
Many of them are
probably already chipped.

00:12:34.980 --> 00:12:35.310 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Chipped.

00:12:35.310 --> 00:12:35.840 align:middle line:90%
>>HENRY: Exactly.

00:12:35.840 --> 00:12:37.400 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: I was wondering,
have you heard anything

00:12:37.400 --> 00:12:39.050 align:middle line:84%
about chipping programs
for the refugees.

00:12:39.050 --> 00:12:39.850 align:middle line:90%
>>HENRY: I have.

00:12:39.850 --> 00:12:41.760 align:middle line:84%
I don't have direct
evidence of it

00:12:41.760 --> 00:12:44.280 align:middle line:84%
but I know that the biometrics
are really important

00:12:44.280 --> 00:12:45.660 align:middle line:90%
and they are being given cards.

00:12:45.660 --> 00:12:47.410 align:middle line:84%
I wouldn't be at all
surprised if they're,

00:12:47.410 --> 00:12:48.720 align:middle line:90%
in fact, being shipped.

00:12:48.720 --> 00:12:51.350 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So you're
talking also,

00:12:51.350 --> 00:12:53.680 align:middle line:84%
throughout the Bible are
sprinkled various phrases

00:12:53.680 --> 00:12:55.650 align:middle line:84%
and let's talk about
some of those races,

00:12:55.650 --> 00:12:59.705 align:middle line:84%
including a light body
prophecy, machine man, all

00:12:59.705 --> 00:13:01.830 align:middle line:84%
of these different references
throughout the Bible.

00:13:01.830 --> 00:13:06.050 align:middle line:84%
And as you were researching
it, how you interpreted them

00:13:06.050 --> 00:13:08.150 align:middle line:84%
and how this relates
to transhumanism.

00:13:08.150 --> 00:13:09.940 align:middle line:90%
>>HENRY: Here's how it relates.

00:13:09.940 --> 00:13:13.310 align:middle line:84%
The Christian prophecy,
which goes in one direction,

00:13:13.310 --> 00:13:16.140 align:middle line:84%
it begins in Eden and ends
in the Book of Revelation

00:13:16.140 --> 00:13:19.070 align:middle line:84%
with Armageddon, the apocalypse,
and the second coming, Judgment

00:13:19.070 --> 00:13:19.900 align:middle line:90%
Day.

00:13:19.900 --> 00:13:23.490 align:middle line:84%
At Judgment Day is when we have
the second coming of Christ.

00:13:23.490 --> 00:13:26.960 align:middle line:84%
And at that time, according
to Christian prophecy,

00:13:26.960 --> 00:13:29.445 align:middle line:84%
our bodies are going
to be transfigured.

00:13:29.445 --> 00:13:31.570 align:middle line:84%
In the blink of an eye, in
the twinkling of an eye,

00:13:31.570 --> 00:13:33.740 align:middle line:90%
we're going to be transformed.

00:13:33.740 --> 00:13:36.330 align:middle line:84%
Our bodies are going
to be identical to,

00:13:36.330 --> 00:13:40.340 align:middle line:84%
they're going to mirror the
Resurrection body of Christ.

00:13:40.340 --> 00:13:42.100 align:middle line:84%
The Resurrection
body of Christ is not

00:13:42.100 --> 00:13:43.240 align:middle line:90%
in a flesh and blood form.

00:13:43.240 --> 00:13:43.600 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:13:43.600 --> 00:13:43.830 align:middle line:90%
>>HENRY: It's a light--

00:13:43.830 --> 00:13:45.080 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: It's an energy form.

00:13:45.080 --> 00:13:46.400 align:middle line:90%
>>HENRY: It's an energy form.

00:13:46.400 --> 00:13:48.060 align:middle line:84%
And this is what
drives Christianity

00:13:48.060 --> 00:13:52.260 align:middle line:84%
is that one day we will be
like the resurrected Christ.

00:13:52.260 --> 00:13:54.920 align:middle line:84%
And not only that, but we will
live in a new Kingdom of Heaven

00:13:54.920 --> 00:13:56.210 align:middle line:90%
spread out on the Earth.

00:13:56.210 --> 00:13:59.402 align:middle line:84%
A new Earth will take
place of the old Earth.

00:13:59.402 --> 00:14:01.110 align:middle line:84%
So how does this relate
to transhumanism?

00:14:01.110 --> 00:14:04.730 align:middle line:84%
When you follow the
ultimate extension

00:14:04.730 --> 00:14:06.670 align:middle line:84%
of the point of
view of transhumans,

00:14:06.670 --> 00:14:10.290 align:middle line:84%
they say, well, the
human body is fragile.

00:14:10.290 --> 00:14:11.960 align:middle line:90%
It's got all kinds of issues.

00:14:11.960 --> 00:14:13.040 align:middle line:90%
Let's augment it.

00:14:13.040 --> 00:14:13.920 align:middle line:90%
Let's improve it.

00:14:13.920 --> 00:14:15.224 align:middle line:90%
Let's perfect it.

00:14:15.224 --> 00:14:17.390 align:middle line:84%
But then beyond that, they
say, well, wait a minute.

00:14:17.390 --> 00:14:20.060 align:middle line:84%
Why do you want one of
these things anyway?

00:14:20.060 --> 00:14:21.970 align:middle line:84%
You really don't need
a flesh and blood body,

00:14:21.970 --> 00:14:24.830 align:middle line:84%
even if it is chock full
of electronics and computer

00:14:24.830 --> 00:14:26.540 align:middle line:90%
technology, digital technology.

00:14:26.540 --> 00:14:30.780 align:middle line:10%
What you really want
is an avatar body,

00:14:30.780 --> 00:14:34.910 align:middle line:10%
a light body that lives in our
new simulated reality built

00:14:34.910 --> 00:14:38.170 align:middle line:10%
by our new supercomputer that's
going to make this reality

00:14:38.170 --> 00:14:39.694 align:middle line:10%
look like a slum.

00:14:39.694 --> 00:14:41.860 align:middle line:84%
So what they're going to
try to do is convince you--

00:14:41.860 --> 00:14:43.160 align:middle line:84%
and they're already in
the process of doing this.

00:14:43.160 --> 00:14:43.450 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: They're
already playing

00:14:43.450 --> 00:14:45.980 align:middle line:84%
with this with VR
technology to get

00:14:45.980 --> 00:14:49.570 align:middle line:84%
people used to this
Eden-type of environment.

00:14:49.570 --> 00:14:51.907 align:middle line:84%
And sex with any
beautiful woman you want.

00:14:51.907 --> 00:14:52.740 align:middle line:90%
>>HENRY: You got it.

00:14:52.740 --> 00:14:53.170 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: And yeah.

00:14:53.170 --> 00:14:54.010 align:middle line:90%
>>HENRY: Exactly.

00:14:54.010 --> 00:14:55.060 align:middle line:90%
That's the real carrot.

00:14:55.060 --> 00:14:55.860 align:middle line:90%
Here kitty, kitty.

00:14:55.860 --> 00:14:56.980 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Well, that's
really, I think,

00:14:56.980 --> 00:14:58.022 align:middle line:90%
what's driving VR is sex.

00:14:58.022 --> 00:14:58.855 align:middle line:90%
>>HENRY: Absolutely.

00:14:58.855 --> 00:15:00.410 align:middle line:90%
There's no question about it.

00:15:00.410 --> 00:15:02.100 align:middle line:84%
And so this is their
vision is they're

00:15:02.100 --> 00:15:06.700 align:middle line:84%
going to create this new Earth,
where you will be inhabiting

00:15:06.700 --> 00:15:08.630 align:middle line:84%
it, not in your
flesh and blood body

00:15:08.630 --> 00:15:10.770 align:middle line:84%
but in an uploaded
version of yourself.

00:15:10.770 --> 00:15:13.070 align:middle line:84%
Where they will be
able to take a mind

00:15:13.070 --> 00:15:15.760 align:middle line:84%
map, a neural map of the
contents of your brain,

00:15:15.760 --> 00:15:19.470 align:middle line:84%
upload it into your
holographic avatar that

00:15:19.470 --> 00:15:22.780 align:middle line:84%
can be male, female, animal,
divine, whatever you want

00:15:22.780 --> 00:15:25.680 align:middle line:84%
and you will then live in
that simulated reality.

00:15:25.680 --> 00:15:28.810 align:middle line:84%
That is a fulfillment of
this Christian prophecy

00:15:28.810 --> 00:15:32.600 align:middle line:84%
of a new Earth and dwelling in
this new Earth and new light

00:15:32.600 --> 00:15:33.889 align:middle line:90%
bodies.

00:15:33.889 --> 00:15:35.430 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Do you
think-- well, OK I'm

00:15:35.430 --> 00:15:37.763 align:middle line:84%
going to get to something
that Paul said because now, we

00:15:37.763 --> 00:15:40.030 align:middle line:84%
get into the interface
of different kinds

00:15:40.030 --> 00:15:43.880 align:middle line:84%
of consciousness trying
to have an influence

00:15:43.880 --> 00:15:47.070 align:middle line:84%
over our consciousness
on planet Earth, OK?

00:15:47.070 --> 00:15:50.010 align:middle line:84%
So before I ask
that, do you think

00:15:50.010 --> 00:15:54.190 align:middle line:84%
that was some kind of
prophecy or was it, perhaps,

00:15:54.190 --> 00:15:56.247 align:middle line:90%
an alert or what?

00:15:56.247 --> 00:15:58.080 align:middle line:84%
>>HENRY: I definitely
think it was an alert.

00:15:58.080 --> 00:15:59.940 align:middle line:84%
What we're talking
about is a letter

00:15:59.940 --> 00:16:02.860 align:middle line:84%
that Paul-- it was in
Rome 62 AD, in prison.

00:16:02.860 --> 00:16:05.000 align:middle line:84%
He writes a letter to the
people of Ephesus Turkey,

00:16:05.000 --> 00:16:06.020 align:middle line:90%
the Ephesians.

00:16:06.020 --> 00:16:07.820 align:middle line:84%
It's called the
Book of Ephesians.

00:16:07.820 --> 00:16:12.040 align:middle line:84%
And he warns about an
extraterrestrial power.

00:16:12.040 --> 00:16:15.210 align:middle line:84%
He refers to as the power
of the air or the powers,

00:16:15.210 --> 00:16:17.970 align:middle line:84%
who are also referred
to as the Archons.

00:16:17.970 --> 00:16:19.912 align:middle line:84%
Lots of data now
about the Archons.

00:16:19.912 --> 00:16:21.620 align:middle line:10%
>>REGINA: Well, let's
talk about it some.

00:16:21.620 --> 00:16:24.280 align:middle line:84%
>>HENRY: Yeah, there's
perspectives-- John Lash

00:16:24.280 --> 00:16:26.940 align:middle line:84%
and others believe the Archons
are potentially the Grey

00:16:26.940 --> 00:16:29.570 align:middle line:90%
aliens, non-biological beings.

00:16:29.570 --> 00:16:33.830 align:middle line:84%
They're partially biological,
partially machine beings,

00:16:33.830 --> 00:16:40.156 align:middle line:84%
transhuman beings who don't
have souls and seek human souls.

00:16:40.156 --> 00:16:41.530 align:middle line:84%
And they seek to
do anything they

00:16:41.530 --> 00:16:44.620 align:middle line:90%
can to take our souls from us.

00:16:44.620 --> 00:16:46.730 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Now, the Reptilians
are involved in that

00:16:46.730 --> 00:16:47.530 align:middle line:90%
too, right?

00:16:47.530 --> 00:16:48.970 align:middle line:90%
>>HENRY: Well that's--

00:16:48.970 --> 00:16:51.270 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: According to
Lash, it plays in there.

00:16:51.270 --> 00:16:52.420 align:middle line:90%
>>HENRY: It gets a little--

00:16:52.420 --> 00:16:52.980 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: And who knows?

00:16:52.980 --> 00:16:54.709 align:middle line:84%
We don't really know
the different realms

00:16:54.709 --> 00:16:56.000 align:middle line:90%
that are playing with this one.

00:16:56.000 --> 00:16:56.440 align:middle line:90%
>>HENRY: Right.

00:16:56.440 --> 00:16:58.565 align:middle line:84%
No, we don't know if the
Archons and the Reptilians

00:16:58.565 --> 00:17:02.850 align:middle line:84%
are the same or their
actual relationship.

00:17:02.850 --> 00:17:07.150 align:middle line:84%
But Paul clearly
spells out this warning

00:17:07.150 --> 00:17:10.359 align:middle line:84%
in the Book of Ephesians to
say, watch out for these Archons

00:17:10.359 --> 00:17:14.310 align:middle line:84%
and these powers that
come from other worlds.

00:17:14.310 --> 00:17:15.640 align:middle line:90%
They want our souls.

00:17:15.640 --> 00:17:17.200 align:middle line:90%
And he has a remedy for it.

00:17:17.200 --> 00:17:19.750 align:middle line:84%
He tells us that the way
we can protect ourselves

00:17:19.750 --> 00:17:22.210 align:middle line:90%
is by augmenting the body.

00:17:22.210 --> 00:17:25.060 align:middle line:84%
By putting on, what he calls
the crown of salvation,

00:17:25.060 --> 00:17:26.829 align:middle line:84%
the breastplate
of righteousness,

00:17:26.829 --> 00:17:28.870 align:middle line:84%
the belt of truth,
the sandals of peace,

00:17:28.870 --> 00:17:30.130 align:middle line:90%
and the sword of faith.

00:17:30.130 --> 00:17:31.547 align:middle line:90%
Higher attributes, virtues.

00:17:31.547 --> 00:17:32.380 align:middle line:90%
>>HENRY: Absolutely.

00:17:32.380 --> 00:17:33.180 align:middle line:90%
Are they?

00:17:33.180 --> 00:17:35.750 align:middle line:84%
Or are these actual
physical objects

00:17:35.750 --> 00:17:37.500 align:middle line:90%
he's telling us to go acquire?

00:17:37.500 --> 00:17:39.784 align:middle line:84%
My answer is they're
psychospiritual attributes.

00:17:39.784 --> 00:17:41.450 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: They're
psychospiritual, yeah.

00:17:41.450 --> 00:17:43.033 align:middle line:84%
>>HENRY: He's telling
us to augment it

00:17:43.033 --> 00:17:45.582 align:middle line:84%
by tapping into our--
awakening our crown chakra.

00:17:45.582 --> 00:17:46.790 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Our higher virtues.

00:17:46.790 --> 00:17:49.900 align:middle line:84%
>>HENRY: Exactly, opening the
heart chakra, speaking truth.

00:17:49.900 --> 00:17:52.070 align:middle line:84%
The belt of truth
is exactly that.

00:17:52.070 --> 00:17:54.089 align:middle line:84%
It's not something
we have to go get.

00:17:54.089 --> 00:17:56.630 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: But do you think that
other communities are looking

00:17:56.630 --> 00:17:58.480 align:middle line:90%
at this as physical technology?

00:17:58.480 --> 00:17:59.981 align:middle line:84%
>>HENRY: Absolutely,
especially when

00:17:59.981 --> 00:18:02.063 align:middle line:84%
you talk about the Jewish
high priest in Jerusalem

00:18:02.063 --> 00:18:03.940 align:middle line:84%
that people are
anticipating a second coming

00:18:03.940 --> 00:18:06.260 align:middle line:84%
and so they're trying to go
find the actual breastplate

00:18:06.260 --> 00:18:08.530 align:middle line:84%
of righteousness and
the crown of salvation.

00:18:08.530 --> 00:18:09.980 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Oh, sure some
of Google's technologists

00:18:09.980 --> 00:18:10.660 align:middle line:90%
can create it.

00:18:10.660 --> 00:18:12.910 align:middle line:84%
>>HENRY: Right, they think
they're actual power tools.

00:18:12.910 --> 00:18:15.170 align:middle line:84%
But these are
psychospiritual attributes

00:18:15.170 --> 00:18:16.760 align:middle line:84%
that are developed
from within us,

00:18:16.760 --> 00:18:19.690 align:middle line:84%
that everybody can
activate from within.

00:18:19.690 --> 00:18:21.440 align:middle line:84%
And so clearly, if
you're looking for them

00:18:21.440 --> 00:18:23.810 align:middle line:84%
as exterior power
tools, it's going

00:18:23.810 --> 00:18:25.140 align:middle line:90%
to take you down one path.

00:18:25.140 --> 00:18:26.902 align:middle line:84%
But if you're looking
at it internally,

00:18:26.902 --> 00:18:28.610 align:middle line:84%
it's going to take
you down another path.

00:18:28.610 --> 00:18:30.750 align:middle line:84%
And clearly, we want to
go down the internal path.

00:18:30.750 --> 00:18:33.030 align:middle line:84%
We don't need this
technology in order

00:18:33.030 --> 00:18:36.600 align:middle line:84%
to be able to do all the
things that our technology is

00:18:36.600 --> 00:18:37.949 align:middle line:90%
making it so easy for us to do.

00:18:37.949 --> 00:18:38.990 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Absolutely not.

00:18:38.990 --> 00:18:41.710 align:middle line:84%
And you say that this
heavenly realm written about,

00:18:41.710 --> 00:18:44.260 align:middle line:84%
including the Archons is
also in the Nag Hammadi.

00:18:44.260 --> 00:18:45.350 align:middle line:90%
>>HENRY: Yes, absolutely.

00:18:45.350 --> 00:18:47.840 align:middle line:84%
This is the basis for
all the Gnostic texts,

00:18:47.840 --> 00:18:50.630 align:middle line:84%
is this new Kingdom of
Heaven and this new Earth,

00:18:50.630 --> 00:18:54.150 align:middle line:84%
as well as the emergence
of a perfect man.

00:18:54.150 --> 00:18:56.080 align:middle line:84%
This is the term
they keep using.

00:18:56.080 --> 00:18:58.357 align:middle line:84%
But when you, as
I have done, gone

00:18:58.357 --> 00:19:00.690 align:middle line:84%
through these various traditions
and tried to understand

00:19:00.690 --> 00:19:02.830 align:middle line:90%
what is the perfect human?

00:19:02.830 --> 00:19:05.620 align:middle line:84%
Well, the word perfect
in this context

00:19:05.620 --> 00:19:09.880 align:middle line:90%
means whole, holy, and complete.

00:19:09.880 --> 00:19:11.400 align:middle line:84%
So it doesn't mean
that we're going

00:19:11.400 --> 00:19:14.640 align:middle line:84%
to augment ourselves through
some kind of Google technology

00:19:14.640 --> 00:19:15.820 align:middle line:90%
and become perfect.

00:19:15.820 --> 00:19:20.210 align:middle line:84%
Rather, it's a state within
us that everybody can acquire.

00:19:20.210 --> 00:19:22.410 align:middle line:84%
The state of wholeness
and holiness.

00:19:22.410 --> 00:19:24.690 align:middle line:84%
And every spiritual
tradition talks

00:19:24.690 --> 00:19:28.170 align:middle line:84%
about the emergence of a
perfect human being, who

00:19:28.170 --> 00:19:30.250 align:middle line:90%
is not a flesh and blood being.

00:19:30.250 --> 00:19:33.010 align:middle line:84%
They all agree
that the human body

00:19:33.010 --> 00:19:35.880 align:middle line:90%
was designed for ascension.

00:19:35.880 --> 00:19:38.790 align:middle line:84%
It was designed to be spun
into a vortex of energy that

00:19:38.790 --> 00:19:41.154 align:middle line:84%
ultimately manifests
as five-colored rainbow

00:19:41.154 --> 00:19:42.820 align:middle line:84%
light, which they
call the rainbow body.

00:19:42.820 --> 00:19:43.850 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: When the time comes.

00:19:43.850 --> 00:19:46.470 align:middle line:84%
When a person has reached that
point in their own evolution.

00:19:46.470 --> 00:19:47.270 align:middle line:90%
>>HENRY: Exactly.

00:19:47.270 --> 00:19:50.260 align:middle line:84%
But along the way, there have
been many gurus and avatars

00:19:50.260 --> 00:19:53.610 align:middle line:84%
that have attained the
status to show us the way.

00:19:53.610 --> 00:19:55.360 align:middle line:84%
And something that I
find very interesting

00:19:55.360 --> 00:19:58.740 align:middle line:84%
is that when you look into the
Dead Sea Scrolls, for example,

00:19:58.740 --> 00:20:00.770 align:middle line:84%
of the Essenes,
they were clearly

00:20:00.770 --> 00:20:04.040 align:middle line:84%
part of this program that
was trying to infuse humanity

00:20:04.040 --> 00:20:06.830 align:middle line:84%
with a, call it a higher
vibrational being,

00:20:06.830 --> 00:20:07.870 align:middle line:90%
a new way of living.

00:20:07.870 --> 00:20:11.800 align:middle line:84%
They believed that humans
could transform into angels

00:20:11.800 --> 00:20:15.330 align:middle line:84%
and that the angels had
come to Earth to show humans

00:20:15.330 --> 00:20:17.970 align:middle line:84%
how to scale the
evolutionary ladder.

00:20:17.970 --> 00:20:21.840 align:middle line:84%
And not through technology but
through psychospiritual means.

00:20:21.840 --> 00:20:26.910 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And if you look into
the people-- it's interesting.

00:20:26.910 --> 00:20:28.720 align:middle line:84%
There was a site
called intelligence.org

00:20:28.720 --> 00:20:32.430 align:middle line:84%
that was about the-- I
mean, it was essentially

00:20:32.430 --> 00:20:35.320 align:middle line:84%
featuring the movement in
the transhuman community

00:20:35.320 --> 00:20:36.930 align:middle line:90%
scientifically out of MIT.

00:20:36.930 --> 00:20:38.450 align:middle line:90%
That whole site's different now.

00:20:38.450 --> 00:20:41.640 align:middle line:84%
I'm not recognizing anything
like it was two years ago.

00:20:41.640 --> 00:20:43.570 align:middle line:84%
So I don't know what's
happened, whether it's

00:20:43.570 --> 00:20:47.910 align:middle line:84%
been given an upgrade, like
a marketing upgrade or what

00:20:47.910 --> 00:20:49.080 align:middle line:90%
because of scandal.

00:20:49.080 --> 00:20:52.930 align:middle line:84%
But what I'm saying
is, I think, that most

00:20:52.930 --> 00:20:57.140 align:middle line:84%
of the people involved are
probably atheistic and agnostic

00:20:57.140 --> 00:20:59.320 align:middle line:84%
and so therefore, fear
their own immortality

00:20:59.320 --> 00:21:00.781 align:middle line:90%
and that's what's driving it.

00:21:00.781 --> 00:21:02.280 align:middle line:84%
>>HENRY: And that
was another reason

00:21:02.280 --> 00:21:03.840 align:middle line:84%
I wrote this book
is to say, look,

00:21:03.840 --> 00:21:05.785 align:middle line:84%
if you're involved in
these technologies,

00:21:05.785 --> 00:21:09.160 align:middle line:84%
if you're part of the Digerati,
as they're called, in Silicon

00:21:09.160 --> 00:21:12.450 align:middle line:84%
Valley or Shanghai or Tokyo
or wherever, you should

00:21:12.450 --> 00:21:15.370 align:middle line:84%
know that there's a
timeline that all of this

00:21:15.370 --> 00:21:16.570 align:middle line:90%
has been following.

00:21:16.570 --> 00:21:20.720 align:middle line:84%
And that this isn't
necessarily the first step

00:21:20.720 --> 00:21:22.340 align:middle line:84%
in the transformation
of humanity.

00:21:22.340 --> 00:21:25.020 align:middle line:84%
It's one of many steps
that we've been taking.

00:21:25.020 --> 00:21:27.910 align:middle line:84%
And if they can understand it
in a historical and especially

00:21:27.910 --> 00:21:30.450 align:middle line:84%
a spiritual context,
maybe they'll

00:21:30.450 --> 00:21:33.490 align:middle line:84%
back off on the assault
on the human body

00:21:33.490 --> 00:21:35.460 align:middle line:90%
and also on all of humanity.

00:21:35.460 --> 00:21:39.975 align:middle line:84%
I mean, their goal is to
turn us into smart things.

00:21:39.975 --> 00:21:42.270 align:middle line:84%
And by smart, I don't
mean more intelligent

00:21:42.270 --> 00:21:45.722 align:middle line:84%
or having a higher IQ but rather
a two-way communication system.

00:21:45.722 --> 00:21:46.680 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Programmable.

00:21:46.680 --> 00:21:48.096 align:middle line:10%
>> HENRY: Programmable,
watchable,

00:21:48.096 --> 00:21:50.560 align:middle line:10%
just like your toaster
or your microwave oven

00:21:50.560 --> 00:21:52.580 align:middle line:10%
or your refrigerator.

00:21:52.580 --> 00:21:55.550 align:middle line:84%
20 years ago there were
maybe a billion smart things

00:21:55.550 --> 00:21:56.390 align:middle line:90%
on the planet.

00:21:56.390 --> 00:21:59.820 align:middle line:84%
By 2020 there will be
50 billion smart things,

00:21:59.820 --> 00:22:01.550 align:middle line:84%
all interconnected
on something they

00:22:01.550 --> 00:22:05.170 align:middle line:84%
call the internet of things
or the planetary skin,

00:22:05.170 --> 00:22:08.880 align:middle line:84%
where the whole planet
will be networked together.

00:22:08.880 --> 00:22:10.930 align:middle line:84%
And in fact, this
is Google's promise,

00:22:10.930 --> 00:22:14.930 align:middle line:84%
that if you will
ultimately subscribe

00:22:14.930 --> 00:22:18.520 align:middle line:84%
to what they call their
synthetic neocortex problem--

00:22:18.520 --> 00:22:19.320 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Program.

00:22:19.320 --> 00:22:19.760 align:middle line:90%
>>HENRY: Program.

00:22:19.760 --> 00:22:20.660 align:middle line:90%
Yeah, it is a problem.

00:22:20.660 --> 00:22:21.190 align:middle line:90%
Sorry.

00:22:21.190 --> 00:22:22.112 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: It is a problem.

00:22:22.112 --> 00:22:23.480 align:middle line:84%
>>HENRY: But Google
plans to create

00:22:23.480 --> 00:22:25.104 align:middle line:84%
this synthetic
neocortex, where they'll

00:22:25.104 --> 00:22:27.240 align:middle line:84%
sprinkle smart dust
in your neocortex

00:22:27.240 --> 00:22:29.880 align:middle line:84%
and every single
person on the planet

00:22:29.880 --> 00:22:31.900 align:middle line:90%
will automatically be connected.

00:22:31.900 --> 00:22:34.400 align:middle line:84%
That's Mark Zuckerberg's
goal from Facebook

00:22:34.400 --> 00:22:38.630 align:middle line:84%
as well, to have every single
human being on the planet

00:22:38.630 --> 00:22:40.160 align:middle line:90%
online together.

00:22:40.160 --> 00:22:42.700 align:middle line:84%
And the thing is that many
of these people that they're

00:22:42.700 --> 00:22:45.660 align:middle line:84%
trying to get online
don't have a toilet

00:22:45.660 --> 00:22:47.010 align:middle line:90%
and don't have clean water.

00:22:47.010 --> 00:22:47.970 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: They
have smart phones.

00:22:47.970 --> 00:22:49.470 align:middle line:84%
>>HENRY: But they
have smart phones.

00:22:49.470 --> 00:22:53.610 align:middle line:84%
So here somebody,
somewhere has decided

00:22:53.610 --> 00:22:57.620 align:middle line:84%
that implantation of technology
and bringing people online

00:22:57.620 --> 00:23:01.090 align:middle line:84%
supersedes the need for
clean water and sanitation.

00:23:01.090 --> 00:23:03.570 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Absolutely, and I
would lay money again back

00:23:03.570 --> 00:23:04.960 align:middle line:90%
to the point I just made.

00:23:04.960 --> 00:23:07.390 align:middle line:84%
Ask any of these
people if they have

00:23:07.390 --> 00:23:10.510 align:middle line:84%
any understanding of an
aspect of their being

00:23:10.510 --> 00:23:12.820 align:middle line:90%
that transcends physical meat.

00:23:12.820 --> 00:23:14.710 align:middle line:84%
I'm guessing the
answer will be no.

00:23:14.710 --> 00:23:15.530 align:middle line:84%
>>HENRY: I would
agree with that.

00:23:15.530 --> 00:23:16.960 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: They do not
believe they have a soul.

00:23:16.960 --> 00:23:18.250 align:middle line:84%
>>HENRY: I would
agree with that.

00:23:18.250 --> 00:23:19.833 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So there's
everything in it.

00:23:19.833 --> 00:23:22.220 align:middle line:84%
They've got the money, the
technology, the research,

00:23:22.220 --> 00:23:25.640 align:middle line:84%
the means, to be able
to create this vehicle.

00:23:25.640 --> 00:23:27.870 align:middle line:84%
And if you think
you're expiring anyway,

00:23:27.870 --> 00:23:30.100 align:middle line:84%
what's to lose in
just transferring

00:23:30.100 --> 00:23:32.120 align:middle line:84%
whatever kind of
brain mapping patterns

00:23:32.120 --> 00:23:35.580 align:middle line:84%
over into a nonphysical
object, so to speak.

00:23:35.580 --> 00:23:37.870 align:middle line:84%
What's to lose, from that
point of view, right?

00:23:37.870 --> 00:23:40.287 align:middle line:84%
>>HENRY: From their point of
view, your soul is not some--

00:23:40.287 --> 00:23:41.494 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: You don't have one.

00:23:41.494 --> 00:23:43.190 align:middle line:10%
>>HENRY: Well, it's
the accumulation

00:23:43.190 --> 00:23:46.010 align:middle line:10%
of every keystroke you put on
Facebook, every recorded phone

00:23:46.010 --> 00:23:50.940 align:middle line:10%
conversation that Prism has
recorded, that's your soul.

00:23:50.940 --> 00:23:51.740 align:middle line:90%
That's it.

00:23:51.740 --> 00:23:55.270 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: I know
that's why-- but they

00:23:55.270 --> 00:23:57.760 align:middle line:90%
have the political power.

00:23:57.760 --> 00:23:59.310 align:middle line:90%
They have the military power.

00:23:59.310 --> 00:24:02.200 align:middle line:84%
They have the power over
research at the universities.

00:24:02.200 --> 00:24:03.390 align:middle line:90%
They have the money.

00:24:03.390 --> 00:24:06.180 align:middle line:84%
They don't have power over
any one of us individually

00:24:06.180 --> 00:24:08.280 align:middle line:84%
but they have power
over all the systems

00:24:08.280 --> 00:24:13.070 align:middle line:84%
to create this horribly
atheistic, in the densest sense

00:24:13.070 --> 00:24:14.780 align:middle line:90%
of the word, agenda.

00:24:14.780 --> 00:24:16.850 align:middle line:84%
>>HENRY: This is the
globalist utopia.

00:24:16.850 --> 00:24:18.610 align:middle line:90%
They call this transnationalism.

00:24:18.610 --> 00:24:21.280 align:middle line:84%
And as I mentioned,
transnationalism, transhumanism

00:24:21.280 --> 00:24:22.210 align:middle line:90%
are intertwined.

00:24:22.210 --> 00:24:24.550 align:middle line:84%
You can't have the
globalist agenda.

00:24:24.550 --> 00:24:28.670 align:middle line:84%
UN 2030 is every bit
of this, where you will

00:24:28.670 --> 00:24:30.599 align:middle line:90%
live in a borderless world.

00:24:30.599 --> 00:24:31.640 align:middle line:90%
There will be no borders.

00:24:31.640 --> 00:24:34.550 align:middle line:90%
There will be no gender either.

00:24:34.550 --> 00:24:37.270 align:middle line:84%
Because ultimately, their vision
is for you to be androgynous.

00:24:37.270 --> 00:24:38.700 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Well, we're
leading that way anyway.

00:24:38.700 --> 00:24:39.500 align:middle line:90%
>>HENRY: Exactly.

00:24:39.500 --> 00:24:42.080 align:middle line:84%
John Kerry gave a commencement
address back in May

00:24:42.080 --> 00:24:44.887 align:middle line:84%
to a university up
in Massachusetts.

00:24:44.887 --> 00:24:46.220 align:middle line:90%
Let me take you into the future.

00:24:46.220 --> 00:24:49.310 align:middle line:84%
There's no borders and
there are no nations.

00:24:49.310 --> 00:24:50.760 align:middle line:90%
It's just one world.

00:24:50.760 --> 00:24:53.630 align:middle line:84%
And now, that sounds really nice
as long as we love each other.

00:24:53.630 --> 00:24:55.716 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Not if it's
through chip technology

00:24:55.716 --> 00:24:57.340 align:middle line:84%
because we're all
being tracked anyway.

00:24:57.340 --> 00:25:00.890 align:middle line:84%
>>HENRY: But you cannot
accomplish the globalist agenda

00:25:00.890 --> 00:25:02.290 align:middle line:90%
without transhumanism.

00:25:02.290 --> 00:25:04.169 align:middle line:90%
It is not going to happen.

00:25:04.169 --> 00:25:05.710 align:middle line:10%
And so that's why
they're intertwined

00:25:05.710 --> 00:25:07.370 align:middle line:10%
but they don't tell you that.

00:25:07.370 --> 00:25:09.110 align:middle line:10%
They paint this
vision that everybody

00:25:09.110 --> 00:25:12.900 align:middle line:10%
wants to do away with America
and everybody join the EU

00:25:12.900 --> 00:25:16.230 align:middle line:10%
or join the United
Nations Agenda 2030.

00:25:16.230 --> 00:25:18.450 align:middle line:84%
But they don't tell
you the cost of that

00:25:18.450 --> 00:25:22.510 align:middle line:84%
is going to be
ultimately, the infusion

00:25:22.510 --> 00:25:24.370 align:middle line:84%
of our flesh with
this technology

00:25:24.370 --> 00:25:26.880 align:middle line:84%
and the mandating of
chipping of everybody.

00:25:26.880 --> 00:25:28.712 align:middle line:84%
That's the only way
it's going to work.

00:25:28.712 --> 00:25:30.670 align:middle line:10%
>>REGINA: No, your right,
practically speaking,

00:25:30.670 --> 00:25:32.320 align:middle line:10%
functionally speaking.

00:25:32.320 --> 00:25:36.610 align:middle line:84%
And functionally speaking,
I had an experience

00:25:36.610 --> 00:25:39.260 align:middle line:84%
with what you write about,
called the smart dust.

00:25:39.260 --> 00:25:41.902 align:middle line:84%
First, explain what you
know of it as smart dust

00:25:41.902 --> 00:25:42.860 align:middle line:90%
and then I'll tell you.

00:25:42.860 --> 00:25:44.443 align:middle line:84%
And I have not talked
about it before.

00:25:44.443 --> 00:25:49.340 align:middle line:84%
>>HENRY: Smart dust is tiny
microscopic bits of silicon

00:25:49.340 --> 00:25:51.540 align:middle line:84%
that will be sprinkled
into your neocortex, that

00:25:51.540 --> 00:25:54.250 align:middle line:84%
can be in the air all around
you or you're inhaling it.

00:25:54.250 --> 00:25:58.360 align:middle line:84%
And suddenly, it
activates your neocortex.

00:25:58.360 --> 00:26:00.570 align:middle line:84%
It synchs you up with
a computer somewhere,

00:26:00.570 --> 00:26:02.810 align:middle line:84%
makes you watchable,
programmable,

00:26:02.810 --> 00:26:07.140 align:middle line:90%
and in every way, an automaton.

00:26:07.140 --> 00:26:09.920 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So OK, thank you for
explaining that and setting it

00:26:09.920 --> 00:26:11.520 align:middle line:90%
up for our viewers.

00:26:11.520 --> 00:26:15.996 align:middle line:84%
So I was at a dicey place to
be to begin with, you know.

00:26:15.996 --> 00:26:18.280 align:middle line:84%
No one should hang
out at Conspiracy Con.

00:26:18.280 --> 00:26:20.727 align:middle line:84%
Not in my field,
not in your field

00:26:20.727 --> 00:26:22.810 align:middle line:84%
when you talk about edgy
subject matter like this.

00:26:22.810 --> 00:26:25.400 align:middle line:84%
And I was there and
I was, at that time,

00:26:25.400 --> 00:26:27.880 align:middle line:84%
I was actually spending
time at that conference

00:26:27.880 --> 00:26:29.340 align:middle line:90%
with David Icke, all right?

00:26:29.340 --> 00:26:31.840 align:middle line:84%
So you're already--
he's high profile.

00:26:31.840 --> 00:26:35.990 align:middle line:84%
I'm below that but nonetheless,
we're-- you have a lot

00:26:35.990 --> 00:26:38.790 align:middle line:84%
of intelligence agencies
attending these events and you

00:26:38.790 --> 00:26:43.280 align:middle line:84%
have a lot of their
agents of different kinds.

00:26:43.280 --> 00:26:45.770 align:middle line:84%
And I had heard this
talk on smart dust.

00:26:45.770 --> 00:26:47.950 align:middle line:84%
And I thought, wow,
that's insidious.

00:26:47.950 --> 00:26:50.690 align:middle line:84%
Completely invisible,
you would never know.

00:26:50.690 --> 00:26:52.740 align:middle line:84%
And I had an experience
where this woman came up

00:26:52.740 --> 00:26:55.500 align:middle line:84%
to me, when I was separated
from everyone else,

00:26:55.500 --> 00:26:56.420 align:middle line:90%
threw arms around me.

00:26:56.420 --> 00:26:57.540 align:middle line:90%
And I'm a pretty friendly type.

00:26:57.540 --> 00:26:58.220 align:middle line:90%
Oh, hi, you know.

00:26:58.220 --> 00:26:59.020 align:middle line:90%
Hug back.

00:26:59.020 --> 00:27:02.170 align:middle line:84%
Big hugs and started telling me
this kind of cockamamie story.

00:27:02.170 --> 00:27:05.030 align:middle line:84%
And then I saw this
man come up behind her

00:27:05.030 --> 00:27:07.680 align:middle line:84%
and he had his arms folded and
his eyes looked very slightly

00:27:07.680 --> 00:27:08.820 align:middle line:90%
one way and the other.

00:27:08.820 --> 00:27:12.540 align:middle line:84%
Oh, and then my husband came
and saved me from all that.

00:27:12.540 --> 00:27:16.172 align:middle line:84%
And I thought, he looks more
like a handler than a husband.

00:27:16.172 --> 00:27:18.250 align:middle line:84%
And so anyway, I
was compassionate.

00:27:18.250 --> 00:27:19.750 align:middle line:84%
Well, your story--
I don't think you

00:27:19.750 --> 00:27:22.170 align:middle line:84%
should tell your
story at this time.

00:27:22.170 --> 00:27:24.610 align:middle line:84%
I think you should sleep on
it for maybe months because it

00:27:24.610 --> 00:27:26.980 align:middle line:90%
could cause you some problems.

00:27:26.980 --> 00:27:28.830 align:middle line:90%
Oh, well, OK, can I call you?

00:27:28.830 --> 00:27:30.440 align:middle line:84%
Well, sure, this
is my phone number.

00:27:30.440 --> 00:27:31.740 align:middle line:90%
I'm so open.

00:27:31.740 --> 00:27:34.670 align:middle line:84%
It's so stupid in this
industry to be open.

00:27:34.670 --> 00:27:40.210 align:middle line:84%
And anyway, right after that,
I thought, oh, something just

00:27:40.210 --> 00:27:41.010 align:middle line:90%
occurred here.

00:27:41.010 --> 00:27:43.600 align:middle line:84%
I've been had but I don't
know how and I don't know

00:27:43.600 --> 00:27:45.100 align:middle line:90%
how it's going to show up later.

00:27:45.100 --> 00:27:46.930 align:middle line:90%
Anyone can get my phone number.

00:27:46.930 --> 00:27:50.517 align:middle line:84%
So it started about 24 hours
later but I tracked this woman

00:27:50.517 --> 00:27:52.600 align:middle line:84%
and watched what she was
doing at this conference.

00:27:52.600 --> 00:27:57.480 align:middle line:84%
She was going up to
Jordan Maxwell, a couple

00:27:57.480 --> 00:28:00.160 align:middle line:84%
other people that were
speakers at that event that are

00:28:00.160 --> 00:28:02.040 align:middle line:90%
high-profile, edgy material.

00:28:02.040 --> 00:28:04.180 align:middle line:84%
And each time she was
a different person.

00:28:04.180 --> 00:28:08.610 align:middle line:84%
And then I realized, this is
an MKUltra model that NSA,

00:28:08.610 --> 00:28:11.490 align:middle line:84%
whatever agency,
whoever knows, is using.

00:28:11.490 --> 00:28:12.920 align:middle line:90%
And I've been had by her.

00:28:12.920 --> 00:28:14.250 align:middle line:90%
And I thought, damn.

00:28:14.250 --> 00:28:17.460 align:middle line:84%
So then it starts, where
thoughts that are not your own

00:28:17.460 --> 00:28:20.527 align:middle line:84%
starts transmitting
into my mind.

00:28:20.527 --> 00:28:23.110 align:middle line:84%
And I know my mind really well
and I know the range of thought

00:28:23.110 --> 00:28:26.360 align:middle line:84%
I have and don't have and these
were nothing to do with me.

00:28:26.360 --> 00:28:30.420 align:middle line:84%
Very violent images of
men doing torturous things

00:28:30.420 --> 00:28:33.790 align:middle line:84%
and even killing each
other in interesting ways.

00:28:33.790 --> 00:28:35.980 align:middle line:84%
And it would come in,
almost zing in on the hour.

00:28:35.980 --> 00:28:38.690 align:middle line:84%
And I thought,
that's what happened

00:28:38.690 --> 00:28:41.650 align:middle line:90%
and whether it was a dust.

00:28:41.650 --> 00:28:45.620 align:middle line:84%
It was a very, very
advanced technology

00:28:45.620 --> 00:28:49.210 align:middle line:84%
of some kind that interfaces
with the neocortex.

00:28:49.210 --> 00:28:51.060 align:middle line:84%
And the only way--
it took two weeks

00:28:51.060 --> 00:28:53.610 align:middle line:84%
and I started becoming nervous
because it was even intruding

00:28:53.610 --> 00:28:55.068 align:middle line:84%
into dream time
and I thought, I've

00:28:55.068 --> 00:28:56.880 align:middle line:90%
got to find my way out of this.

00:28:56.880 --> 00:28:59.040 align:middle line:84%
And the only way
out was through,

00:28:59.040 --> 00:29:02.330 align:middle line:84%
I had to go into deep meditation
and do a little thing that

00:29:02.330 --> 00:29:04.350 align:middle line:90%
shifted my brain wave patterns.

00:29:04.350 --> 00:29:05.480 align:middle line:90%
>>HENRY: There you go.

00:29:05.480 --> 00:29:07.270 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And I was
able, with the help

00:29:07.270 --> 00:29:12.450 align:middle line:84%
of my own self, my true
self, maybe some guides,

00:29:12.450 --> 00:29:14.570 align:middle line:90%
I was able to do that.

00:29:14.570 --> 00:29:18.290 align:middle line:84%
The complex of all of me was
able to shift my brain wave

00:29:18.290 --> 00:29:22.830 align:middle line:84%
patterns out of
the Hertz frequency

00:29:22.830 --> 00:29:25.160 align:middle line:90%
they were inputting data in.

00:29:25.160 --> 00:29:28.650 align:middle line:84%
But I can say firsthand, that's
why I've never talked about it.

00:29:28.650 --> 00:29:30.300 align:middle line:90%
It's really creepy stuff.

00:29:30.300 --> 00:29:32.170 align:middle line:84%
But that's the only way
to find your way out

00:29:32.170 --> 00:29:33.810 align:middle line:90%
is through consciousness.

00:29:33.810 --> 00:29:36.310 align:middle line:84%
And they're doing this to people
certainly in this community

00:29:36.310 --> 00:29:37.210 align:middle line:90%
but all over.

00:29:37.210 --> 00:29:39.620 align:middle line:84%
As you say, this can even
start going in test groups

00:29:39.620 --> 00:29:41.890 align:middle line:84%
mainstream, where
you're programming

00:29:41.890 --> 00:29:45.200 align:middle line:84%
this information directly into
people's brains, these images.

00:29:45.200 --> 00:29:46.000 align:middle line:90%
It's awful.

00:29:46.000 --> 00:29:46.570 align:middle line:90%
>>HENRY: It is.

00:29:46.570 --> 00:29:48.605 align:middle line:84%
They can edit your
thoughts by remote control

00:29:48.605 --> 00:29:49.938 align:middle line:90%
and that's what you experienced.

00:29:49.938 --> 00:29:51.600 align:middle line:90%
And you also found the solution.

00:29:51.600 --> 00:29:54.700 align:middle line:84%
That we have to go within,
develop our meditation

00:29:54.700 --> 00:29:57.330 align:middle line:84%
abilities and it's
mind over matter.

00:29:57.330 --> 00:29:59.040 align:middle line:84%
It's the only way
to overcome this.

00:29:59.040 --> 00:30:01.200 align:middle line:90%
And that's my rule for people.

00:30:01.200 --> 00:30:04.830 align:middle line:84%
If they're contemplating
maybe getting a pacemaker

00:30:04.830 --> 00:30:07.350 align:middle line:84%
or augmenting
themselves in some way,

00:30:07.350 --> 00:30:11.370 align:middle line:84%
is if you believe in the power
of your mind over matter,

00:30:11.370 --> 00:30:13.280 align:middle line:84%
if you can control
matter with your mind,

00:30:13.280 --> 00:30:16.980 align:middle line:84%
then you might consider this
but only in a life and death

00:30:16.980 --> 00:30:18.250 align:middle line:90%
circumstance.

00:30:18.250 --> 00:30:22.590 align:middle line:84%
Otherwise, do not let them break
the skin barrier because once

00:30:22.590 --> 00:30:25.190 align:middle line:84%
you make that
choice, then you've

00:30:25.190 --> 00:30:30.120 align:middle line:84%
opened yourself up to total
control by some third party.

00:30:30.120 --> 00:30:31.930 align:middle line:84%
It can be a corporation
or a government.

00:30:31.930 --> 00:30:34.120 align:middle line:84%
Actually, they're both the same
thing now, aren't they anyway?

00:30:34.120 --> 00:30:35.661 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Yeah, they
pretty much are.

00:30:35.661 --> 00:30:38.770 align:middle line:84%
Corporatocracy, as John
Perkins calls it, aptly so.

00:30:38.770 --> 00:30:42.239 align:middle line:84%
So let's take the story
back just a little bit

00:30:42.239 --> 00:30:44.530 align:middle line:84%
again because we kind of got
through the Christian part

00:30:44.530 --> 00:30:47.400 align:middle line:84%
of it but the
intelligentsia in Britain

00:30:47.400 --> 00:30:49.000 align:middle line:90%
were a huge part of this.

00:30:49.000 --> 00:30:51.040 align:middle line:84%
Let's talk about some
of the foretelling.

00:30:51.040 --> 00:30:54.360 align:middle line:84%
They were looking at it as
the salvation of humanity.

00:30:54.360 --> 00:30:56.820 align:middle line:90%
Again, which is kind of odd.

00:30:56.820 --> 00:30:58.050 align:middle line:90%
Francis Bacon?

00:30:58.050 --> 00:31:00.600 align:middle line:84%
Because he has a fairly
highly developed,

00:31:00.600 --> 00:31:03.710 align:middle line:84%
seems very highly developed
spiritual essence.

00:31:03.710 --> 00:31:05.080 align:middle line:90%
Let's talk about his part in it.

00:31:05.080 --> 00:31:07.650 align:middle line:84%
Isaac Newton, let's
go back into this.

00:31:07.650 --> 00:31:10.380 align:middle line:84%
>>HENRY: Yeah, this is a
very fascinating history.

00:31:10.380 --> 00:31:14.890 align:middle line:84%
After the time of Francis
Bacon, early 13th century,

00:31:14.890 --> 00:31:17.600 align:middle line:84%
is when you have a real
acceleration in this belief

00:31:17.600 --> 00:31:21.510 align:middle line:84%
that these technological
advancements, the plows,

00:31:21.510 --> 00:31:24.240 align:middle line:84%
the mechanical clocks,
eyeglasses, and so forth,

00:31:24.240 --> 00:31:27.560 align:middle line:84%
are actually gifts
from God, intended

00:31:27.560 --> 00:31:31.650 align:middle line:84%
to help us to attain or regain
our state of perfection.

00:31:31.650 --> 00:31:34.260 align:middle line:84%
The next big player in
this is Sir Francis Bacon,

00:31:34.260 --> 00:31:36.600 align:middle line:84%
who, in his writings,
talked about the perfection

00:31:36.600 --> 00:31:41.330 align:middle line:84%
of humanity once again and
envisioned a new civilization.

00:31:41.330 --> 00:31:43.790 align:middle line:90%
He called it the new Atlantis.

00:31:43.790 --> 00:31:46.000 align:middle line:84%
And he pictured
a group of elders

00:31:46.000 --> 00:31:49.920 align:middle line:84%
that would utilize this advanced
technology for the purpose

00:31:49.920 --> 00:31:52.510 align:middle line:90%
of the advancement of humanity.

00:31:52.510 --> 00:31:55.400 align:middle line:84%
And many people believe
that the New Atlantis wasn't

00:31:55.400 --> 00:31:56.900 align:middle line:90%
going to take place in Britain.

00:31:56.900 --> 00:31:59.830 align:middle line:10%
It was, in fact, going
to take place in America.

00:31:59.830 --> 00:32:02.060 align:middle line:84%
So when the Puritans
were coming over here

00:32:02.060 --> 00:32:05.000 align:middle line:84%
in the 16th and
17th century, they

00:32:05.000 --> 00:32:07.630 align:middle line:84%
were bringing these
ideas with them.

00:32:07.630 --> 00:32:10.710 align:middle line:84%
That we're coming to this
new promised land, America.

00:32:10.710 --> 00:32:12.920 align:middle line:84%
We're bringing
technology with us.

00:32:12.920 --> 00:32:14.330 align:middle line:90%
We're going to conquer nature.

00:32:14.330 --> 00:32:16.520 align:middle line:84%
We're going to accelerate
our development.

00:32:16.520 --> 00:32:17.940 align:middle line:84%
We're coming to a
land where we're

00:32:17.940 --> 00:32:20.800 align:middle line:84%
free of the popes, the
priests, politicians, and pimps

00:32:20.800 --> 00:32:23.170 align:middle line:84%
and we can do whatever
we want spiritually.

00:32:23.170 --> 00:32:25.720 align:middle line:84%
And so now, they
have this new ethos,

00:32:25.720 --> 00:32:29.710 align:middle line:84%
the American dream and that
anybody can become anything

00:32:29.710 --> 00:32:33.750 align:middle line:84%
and especially with
technology as our tool,

00:32:33.750 --> 00:32:35.860 align:middle line:90%
we can make anything happen.

00:32:35.860 --> 00:32:38.430 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Now, he is
credited with also

00:32:38.430 --> 00:32:40.907 align:middle line:84%
writing the popular King
James version of the Bible.

00:32:40.907 --> 00:32:41.740 align:middle line:90%
>>HENRY: Yes, he is.

00:32:41.740 --> 00:32:42.150 align:middle line:90%
That's right.

00:32:42.150 --> 00:32:43.775 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Let's look
at how his version

00:32:43.775 --> 00:32:46.520 align:middle line:84%
of the Bible and this
technologically fit together.

00:32:46.520 --> 00:32:47.960 align:middle line:90%
>>HENRY: Right, right.

00:32:47.960 --> 00:32:50.455 align:middle line:84%
I mean, where are
these guys coming from?

00:32:50.455 --> 00:32:52.080 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: I mean,
he's a brilliant man.

00:32:52.080 --> 00:32:55.120 align:middle line:84%
He's credited with a lot
of brilliant understandings

00:32:55.120 --> 00:32:56.190 align:middle line:90%
he put forth.

00:32:56.190 --> 00:33:00.050 align:middle line:84%
But still, where in the
New Atlantis-- I mean,

00:33:00.050 --> 00:33:03.510 align:middle line:84%
do you see that as direct
referencing to transhumanism

00:33:03.510 --> 00:33:04.640 align:middle line:90%
as it turns out?

00:33:04.640 --> 00:33:06.056 align:middle line:10%
>>HENRY: Well, as
it turns out, he

00:33:06.056 --> 00:33:09.190 align:middle line:10%
couldn't have envisioned
transhumanism at that time.

00:33:09.190 --> 00:33:11.370 align:middle line:84%
The meshing of our
flesh with technology

00:33:11.370 --> 00:33:14.480 align:middle line:84%
was not then on the
table now but that's

00:33:14.480 --> 00:33:16.550 align:middle line:84%
where we were ultimately
going with this.

00:33:16.550 --> 00:33:21.160 align:middle line:10%
Because remember, the goal
has been for 5,000 years,

00:33:21.160 --> 00:33:23.500 align:middle line:10%
is to attain this
ascended state,

00:33:23.500 --> 00:33:26.380 align:middle line:10%
to transform the body,
to perfect the body,

00:33:26.380 --> 00:33:29.880 align:middle line:10%
and especially to
transcend our skin.

00:33:29.880 --> 00:33:31.480 align:middle line:90%
The skin is the problem.

00:33:31.480 --> 00:33:32.700 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: That's why you
call it "The Skingularity."

00:33:32.700 --> 00:33:34.060 align:middle line:84%
>>HENRY: That's why I
call it "The Skingularity"

00:33:34.060 --> 00:33:34.890 align:middle line:90%
because the meshing--

00:33:34.890 --> 00:33:36.610 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Because that's a play
on Kurzweil's "The Singularity

00:33:36.610 --> 00:33:37.600 align:middle line:90%
is Near," yes.

00:33:37.600 --> 00:33:38.400 align:middle line:90%
>>HENRY: Exactly.

00:33:38.400 --> 00:33:39.200 align:middle line:90%
Exactly.

00:33:39.200 --> 00:33:41.847 align:middle line:84%
And it's all aimed at
transcending the skin

00:33:41.847 --> 00:33:42.930 align:middle line:90%
and transforming the skin.

00:33:42.930 --> 00:33:44.520 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: As the
housing of the body.

00:33:44.520 --> 00:33:45.320 align:middle line:90%
>>HENRY: Exactly.

00:33:45.320 --> 00:33:49.389 align:middle line:84%
And it's the skin barrier
that is the thing.

00:33:49.389 --> 00:33:51.680 align:middle line:84%
We're experiencing it today
with all the racial tension

00:33:51.680 --> 00:33:52.480 align:middle line:90%
in America.

00:33:52.480 --> 00:33:55.630 align:middle line:84%
It's about the color
of skin and really it's

00:33:55.630 --> 00:33:58.010 align:middle line:84%
like, you guys, that's
so primitive compared

00:33:58.010 --> 00:34:00.690 align:middle line:84%
to what is actually
happening in our world.

00:34:00.690 --> 00:34:01.912 align:middle line:90%
You're worried about race?

00:34:01.912 --> 00:34:04.120 align:middle line:84%
Have you looked at what's
going on in Silicon Valley?

00:34:04.120 --> 00:34:06.700 align:middle line:84%
Because race simply
will not be an issue.

00:34:06.700 --> 00:34:08.031 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Oh, no, not at all.

00:34:08.031 --> 00:34:09.739 align:middle line:84%
And we're going to
move forward to what's

00:34:09.739 --> 00:34:13.020 align:middle line:84%
happening in Silicon Valley with
the Google boys and so forth.

00:34:13.020 --> 00:34:15.934 align:middle line:84%
But let's go to Isaac
Newton and his part in it.

00:34:15.934 --> 00:34:17.600 align:middle line:84%
>>HENRY: Yeah, Newton
believes that he's

00:34:17.600 --> 00:34:20.670 align:middle line:90%
a prophet, if not a messiah.

00:34:20.670 --> 00:34:22.840 align:middle line:84%
And he, too,
subscribes to this idea

00:34:22.840 --> 00:34:25.884 align:middle line:84%
that we're to attain the
perfection of our body.

00:34:25.884 --> 00:34:28.550 align:middle line:84%
He's one of the great experts on
the Book of Revelation as well.

00:34:28.550 --> 00:34:30.960 align:middle line:84%
He spent half his
life studying alchemy

00:34:30.960 --> 00:34:32.489 align:middle line:84%
and decoding the
Book of Revelation

00:34:32.489 --> 00:34:33.460 align:middle line:90%
and trying to bring about--

00:34:33.460 --> 00:34:34.580 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So what was
his take on Revelations?

00:34:34.580 --> 00:34:37.121 align:middle line:84%
>>HENRY: He believed that he
was living in an end time, where

00:34:37.121 --> 00:34:39.389 align:middle line:84%
they were going to attain
the New Jerusalem, where

00:34:39.389 --> 00:34:42.100 align:middle line:84%
this celestial city
would come out of the sky

00:34:42.100 --> 00:34:45.170 align:middle line:84%
and these advanced human
beings would dwell amongst us

00:34:45.170 --> 00:34:49.095 align:middle line:84%
and show us how to become
citizens of the New Jerusalem.

00:34:49.095 --> 00:34:51.600 align:middle line:90%


00:34:51.600 --> 00:34:54.126 align:middle line:84%
And it sounds an awful lot
like some kind of spaceship

00:34:54.126 --> 00:34:56.250 align:middle line:84%
that they believe is going
to be parked over first,

00:34:56.250 --> 00:34:57.880 align:middle line:90%
Jerusalem at the time of Jesus.

00:34:57.880 --> 00:35:00.430 align:middle line:84%
And then, over Britain,
which they believe

00:35:00.430 --> 00:35:02.060 align:middle line:84%
was the New Jerusalem
at that time.

00:35:02.060 --> 00:35:04.880 align:middle line:10%
But really it's all about--
and here's the key-- in order

00:35:04.880 --> 00:35:06.660 align:middle line:10%
to enter the New
Jerusalem, you have

00:35:06.660 --> 00:35:08.480 align:middle line:10%
to be dressed appropriately.

00:35:08.480 --> 00:35:10.980 align:middle line:84%
You have to be wearing
your robe of light.

00:35:10.980 --> 00:35:12.480 align:middle line:84%
And so here is
this understanding,

00:35:12.480 --> 00:35:16.410 align:middle line:84%
again, that our flesh and
blood form is not the way

00:35:16.410 --> 00:35:17.590 align:middle line:90%
we want to remain.

00:35:17.590 --> 00:35:19.110 align:middle line:90%
We want to transcend this form.

00:35:19.110 --> 00:35:20.750 align:middle line:84%
We want to put on
our light body.

00:35:20.750 --> 00:35:23.120 align:middle line:10%
We want to become
ephemeral light beings,

00:35:23.120 --> 00:35:25.840 align:middle line:10%
just like the dwellers
of the celestial regions,

00:35:25.840 --> 00:35:28.921 align:middle line:10%
the celestial city, the
New Jerusalem, or Zion.

00:35:28.921 --> 00:35:30.420 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And also,
my understanding

00:35:30.420 --> 00:35:33.810 align:middle line:84%
as part of this desire of
the transhuman movement

00:35:33.810 --> 00:35:37.120 align:middle line:84%
is to create a body invulnerable
to other environments.

00:35:37.120 --> 00:35:39.510 align:middle line:84%
In other words, to
plant and colonize, even

00:35:39.510 --> 00:35:41.340 align:middle line:84%
in other star systems
or on other planets.

00:35:41.340 --> 00:35:43.950 align:middle line:84%
>>HENRY: Here's the thing, the
Bible says the flesh and blood

00:35:43.950 --> 00:35:46.230 align:middle line:84%
cannot inherit the
Kingdom of Heaven.

00:35:46.230 --> 00:35:48.580 align:middle line:84%
There's a boundary and
this was the big problem

00:35:48.580 --> 00:35:49.560 align:middle line:90%
in the ancient world.

00:35:49.560 --> 00:35:51.830 align:middle line:84%
And this is where the
watcher angels came down

00:35:51.830 --> 00:35:53.940 align:middle line:84%
and they broke
through that boundary

00:35:53.940 --> 00:35:56.120 align:middle line:84%
and they started taking
humans across that boundary.

00:35:56.120 --> 00:35:57.890 align:middle line:84%
And people were like,
hey, what are you doing?

00:35:57.890 --> 00:35:59.950 align:middle line:10%
Only God's supposed to
be able to tell you when

00:35:59.950 --> 00:36:01.470 align:middle line:10%
you can cross that boundary.

00:36:01.470 --> 00:36:06.320 align:middle line:10%
NASA had to have learned about
this early, maybe the Roswell

00:36:06.320 --> 00:36:10.380 align:middle line:10%
crash, where we allegedly
recover this crashed disk

00:36:10.380 --> 00:36:13.900 align:middle line:10%
and there's non-biological
entities aboard that craft.

00:36:13.900 --> 00:36:16.027 align:middle line:84%
It's not long after
that, that NASA

00:36:16.027 --> 00:36:17.860 align:middle line:84%
starts writing research
papers that if we're

00:36:17.860 --> 00:36:20.068 align:middle line:84%
going to go into space,
we're going to have to become

00:36:20.068 --> 00:36:21.300 align:middle line:90%
a different form of being.

00:36:21.300 --> 00:36:23.621 align:middle line:90%
And they coined a word, cyborg.

00:36:23.621 --> 00:36:25.870 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: I was just going
to bring that up next, yes.

00:36:25.870 --> 00:36:27.280 align:middle line:90%
>>HENRY: NASA realized by 1962--

00:36:27.280 --> 00:36:29.238 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: What is their
definition of a cyborg?

00:36:29.238 --> 00:36:32.040 align:middle line:84%
>>HENRY: A half human,
half machine, is a cyborg.

00:36:32.040 --> 00:36:35.230 align:middle line:10%
And NASA realized that in
order to get off this rock,

00:36:35.230 --> 00:36:37.010 align:middle line:10%
we're going to have
to do something

00:36:37.010 --> 00:36:39.140 align:middle line:10%
different with this human body.

00:36:39.140 --> 00:36:41.300 align:middle line:84%
And apparently,
allegedly, by looking

00:36:41.300 --> 00:36:43.630 align:middle line:84%
at these recovered bodies
at Roswell, they're saying,

00:36:43.630 --> 00:36:46.160 align:middle line:90%
OK, these are robots.

00:36:46.160 --> 00:36:48.310 align:middle line:10%
There they're not
entirely organic.

00:36:48.310 --> 00:36:51.160 align:middle line:10%
They're maybe partially
organic but in order

00:36:51.160 --> 00:36:54.910 align:middle line:10%
to survive in space, we're going
to have to augment the body.

00:36:54.910 --> 00:36:58.210 align:middle line:84%
Because the human body is only
able to assimilate something

00:36:58.210 --> 00:37:00.920 align:middle line:84%
like 20 elements on
the periodic table.

00:37:00.920 --> 00:37:03.630 align:middle line:84%
That's very limiting when
you get out into space.

00:37:03.630 --> 00:37:07.510 align:middle line:84%
We need a body that can go
assimilate over 100 elements

00:37:07.510 --> 00:37:08.860 align:middle line:90%
if we're going to survive.

00:37:08.860 --> 00:37:10.600 align:middle line:10%
And this is something
NASA has realized.

00:37:10.600 --> 00:37:12.610 align:middle line:84%
So it's actually
NASA that started

00:37:12.610 --> 00:37:15.260 align:middle line:84%
promoting the idea
of transhumanism

00:37:15.260 --> 00:37:20.300 align:middle line:84%
and turning humans into
cyborgs as early as 1962.

00:37:20.300 --> 00:37:22.030 align:middle line:90%
This is way before the iPhone.

00:37:22.030 --> 00:37:24.050 align:middle line:84%
This is way before
artificial hearts.

00:37:24.050 --> 00:37:25.960 align:middle line:10%
This is way before
artificial skin

00:37:25.960 --> 00:37:28.110 align:middle line:10%
but they're already
working on it.

00:37:28.110 --> 00:37:31.350 align:middle line:84%
And so perhaps, they had
a lot more technology

00:37:31.350 --> 00:37:33.880 align:middle line:84%
back then than they
were making publicly--

00:37:33.880 --> 00:37:35.380 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Well, I
mean that's what's

00:37:35.380 --> 00:37:39.040 align:middle line:84%
been said, that the military
hidden programs, dark programs

00:37:39.040 --> 00:37:41.620 align:middle line:84%
are 50 to 100 years in
advance technologically.

00:37:41.620 --> 00:37:44.210 align:middle line:84%
So this is what's being broken
in the news what has already

00:37:44.210 --> 00:37:45.710 align:middle line:84%
been accomplished
behind the scenes.

00:37:45.710 --> 00:37:46.580 align:middle line:90%
>>HENRY: Precisely.

00:37:46.580 --> 00:37:49.050 align:middle line:84%
And now, let's go back to
globalism for a moment.

00:37:49.050 --> 00:37:51.660 align:middle line:84%
Elon Musk and others
are saying, oh, well, we

00:37:51.660 --> 00:37:54.080 align:middle line:84%
want to be globalist
because then we

00:37:54.080 --> 00:37:58.080 align:middle line:84%
can become an interplanetary
or multiplanetary society.

00:37:58.080 --> 00:38:02.130 align:middle line:84%
Well, OK, then you must realize
that our flesh and blood bodies

00:38:02.130 --> 00:38:03.940 align:middle line:90%
are not going into space.

00:38:03.940 --> 00:38:06.750 align:middle line:84%
So somewhere in their thinking,
if they haven't already, then

00:38:06.750 --> 00:38:08.800 align:middle line:84%
very quickly they're
going to realize,

00:38:08.800 --> 00:38:11.710 align:middle line:84%
that in order for humanity
to become interplanetary

00:38:11.710 --> 00:38:15.240 align:middle line:84%
or multiplanetary, we will
no longer be human beings.

00:38:15.240 --> 00:38:17.870 align:middle line:84%
We will go into
space as transhumans.

00:38:17.870 --> 00:38:20.510 align:middle line:84%
But we won't go much further
than the moon or possibly

00:38:20.510 --> 00:38:22.280 align:middle line:90%
Mars as human beings.

00:38:22.280 --> 00:38:23.405 align:middle line:90%
It's not going to happen.

00:38:23.405 --> 00:38:26.030 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And it's been thought
that he is working in alignment

00:38:26.030 --> 00:38:28.430 align:middle line:84%
with the government very
closely on these programs

00:38:28.430 --> 00:38:30.830 align:middle line:84%
because it's going to be
privatized in the end anyway.

00:38:30.830 --> 00:38:31.913 align:middle line:90%
>>HENRY: Well, absolutely.

00:38:31.913 --> 00:38:34.860 align:middle line:84%
So they must know this
and all of these people,

00:38:34.860 --> 00:38:37.560 align:middle line:84%
the politicians that
promote globalism,

00:38:37.560 --> 00:38:39.100 align:middle line:90%
they have to know this.

00:38:39.100 --> 00:38:41.160 align:middle line:84%
If they don't, then
they're negligent.

00:38:41.160 --> 00:38:42.960 align:middle line:84%
They're just mouthing
off words that they

00:38:42.960 --> 00:38:45.680 align:middle line:84%
don't know the meaning of
or the full implications of.

00:38:45.680 --> 00:38:48.420 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: The implication that
we have Google Glass, that we

00:38:48.420 --> 00:38:52.200 align:middle line:90%
have this skin, what is it?

00:38:52.200 --> 00:38:53.840 align:middle line:84%
You were talking
about something that

00:38:53.840 --> 00:38:56.530 align:middle line:84%
had been-- the nature of the
skin that had been developed

00:38:56.530 --> 00:38:58.079 align:middle line:90%
and what it's capable of.

00:38:58.079 --> 00:38:59.620 align:middle line:84%
Can you talk about
that a little bit?

00:38:59.620 --> 00:39:04.309 align:middle line:84%
Because I really want to
understand what's public

00:39:04.309 --> 00:39:06.350 align:middle line:84%
and what's coming out
publicly and understanding.

00:39:06.350 --> 00:39:09.000 align:middle line:84%
Advance that 50
years or 100 years,

00:39:09.000 --> 00:39:11.070 align:middle line:84%
that's what's happening
behind the scenes.

00:39:11.070 --> 00:39:13.320 align:middle line:84%
>>HENRY: Right now, when you
want to check your email,

00:39:13.320 --> 00:39:16.470 align:middle line:84%
you take out your iPhone and you
put it in the palm of your hand

00:39:16.470 --> 00:39:18.230 align:middle line:90%
and you scroll through it.

00:39:18.230 --> 00:39:23.130 align:middle line:84%
Imagine getting rid of that and
using your arm as the computer

00:39:23.130 --> 00:39:25.430 align:middle line:84%
pad and you're just
interacting with your arm.

00:39:25.430 --> 00:39:28.230 align:middle line:84%
You're going to see something
projected on your skin.

00:39:28.230 --> 00:39:30.070 align:middle line:90%
So that's one take on this.

00:39:30.070 --> 00:39:33.100 align:middle line:84%
Another take is that, through
Google, their Magic Leap,

00:39:33.100 --> 00:39:35.860 align:middle line:84%
you'll have the retinal
implant and it will all

00:39:35.860 --> 00:39:37.840 align:middle line:90%
be projected all around you.

00:39:37.840 --> 00:39:39.990 align:middle line:84%
So you won't have your
desktop computer anymore.

00:39:39.990 --> 00:39:41.490 align:middle line:84%
You won't have your
iPhone anymore.

00:39:41.490 --> 00:39:44.320 align:middle line:84%
It will probably implanted in
your ear, possibly your tooth

00:39:44.320 --> 00:39:47.730 align:middle line:84%
and you will just
simply be wired.

00:39:47.730 --> 00:39:50.060 align:middle line:84%
You'll be a smart thing,
just like your toaster

00:39:50.060 --> 00:39:54.031 align:middle line:84%
or your microwave oven,
where 24/7, you'll be online.

00:39:54.031 --> 00:39:55.280 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Let's talk about it.

00:39:55.280 --> 00:39:57.790 align:middle line:84%
Let's go further now,
into the implications

00:39:57.790 --> 00:39:59.830 align:middle line:90%
of this on a personal level.

00:39:59.830 --> 00:40:03.490 align:middle line:84%
You mentioned pacemakers
at the top of the show,

00:40:03.490 --> 00:40:05.700 align:middle line:84%
let me write this
down for a second.

00:40:05.700 --> 00:40:09.460 align:middle line:84%
And we're looking
at simpler things.

00:40:09.460 --> 00:40:11.860 align:middle line:84%
I mean, we're looking at
repair from the inside.

00:40:11.860 --> 00:40:13.670 align:middle line:90%
We're looking at nanobots.

00:40:13.670 --> 00:40:15.600 align:middle line:84%
Let's talk about
nanobot technology

00:40:15.600 --> 00:40:18.140 align:middle line:84%
because people
need to understand,

00:40:18.140 --> 00:40:21.120 align:middle line:84%
you may have these
choices to make

00:40:21.120 --> 00:40:24.895 align:middle line:84%
and how far are you willing
to go to extend physical life?

00:40:24.895 --> 00:40:28.190 align:middle line:84%
So tell us all about the nanobot
industry, what they're already

00:40:28.190 --> 00:40:28.990 align:middle line:90%
capable of.

00:40:28.990 --> 00:40:29.990 align:middle line:84%
>>HENRY: What they're
already capable--

00:40:29.990 --> 00:40:31.680 align:middle line:84%
and this has been
shown in mice already.

00:40:31.680 --> 00:40:35.220 align:middle line:84%
That they can take a needle,
implant it into a mouse.

00:40:35.220 --> 00:40:38.890 align:middle line:84%
Tiny nanobots, microscopic, put
10,000 of these little robots

00:40:38.890 --> 00:40:39.900 align:middle line:90%
on the top of--

00:40:39.900 --> 00:40:40.820 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: That are programmed.

00:40:40.820 --> 00:40:41.500 align:middle line:90%
>>HENRY: That are programmed.

00:40:41.500 --> 00:40:42.670 align:middle line:90%
Put them on top of a pencil.

00:40:42.670 --> 00:40:44.010 align:middle line:90%
You can't even see them.

00:40:44.010 --> 00:40:45.610 align:middle line:84%
They would patrol
your bloodstream,

00:40:45.610 --> 00:40:46.830 align:middle line:90%
patrol your arteries.

00:40:46.830 --> 00:40:50.090 align:middle line:84%
If they see any problems, it's
going to report back to HQ.

00:40:50.090 --> 00:40:52.780 align:middle line:84%
HQ's going to say, OK,
well, either release

00:40:52.780 --> 00:40:58.067 align:middle line:84%
this drug into the arteries
or somehow clean them out.

00:40:58.067 --> 00:41:00.400 align:middle line:10%
>>REGINA: And the nanobots
are programmed to actually do

00:41:00.400 --> 00:41:02.240 align:middle line:10%
these things, these tasks?

00:41:02.240 --> 00:41:07.010 align:middle line:10%
Not just feed back information
but two-way communication?

00:41:07.010 --> 00:41:07.810 align:middle line:90%
>>HENRY: Exactly.

00:41:07.810 --> 00:41:10.140 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So are
they're feeding back

00:41:10.140 --> 00:41:14.284 align:middle line:84%
the mathematical information
of these corrections?

00:41:14.284 --> 00:41:15.700 align:middle line:84%
>>HENRY: Some of
it's even visual.

00:41:15.700 --> 00:41:16.575 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: And visual.

00:41:16.575 --> 00:41:17.780 align:middle line:90%
OK, and visual even.

00:41:17.780 --> 00:41:20.380 align:middle line:10%
So it doesn't have to
be an actual substance

00:41:20.380 --> 00:41:22.680 align:middle line:10%
that we're taking by way
of popping pills anymore.

00:41:22.680 --> 00:41:23.940 align:middle line:90%
>>HENRY: No, no, not at all.

00:41:23.940 --> 00:41:25.570 align:middle line:84%
No, you'll have these--
and this is, in fact, this

00:41:25.570 --> 00:41:26.653 align:middle line:90%
is one of Google's dreams.

00:41:26.653 --> 00:41:29.840 align:middle line:84%
You'll wear what's called
a nanonutrient garment.

00:41:29.840 --> 00:41:32.750 align:middle line:84%
Every orifice of your
body, all 10 of them,

00:41:32.750 --> 00:41:35.300 align:middle line:84%
are fair game to Silicon
Valley right now.

00:41:35.300 --> 00:41:37.430 align:middle line:84%
Anyway they can get
inside your body,

00:41:37.430 --> 00:41:40.500 align:middle line:84%
they are working on
technology right now to do so.

00:41:40.500 --> 00:41:43.012 align:middle line:84%
And in Kurzweil's book,
"The Singularity is Near,"

00:41:43.012 --> 00:41:44.470 align:middle line:84%
he talks about
their ultimate dream

00:41:44.470 --> 00:41:48.420 align:middle line:84%
is you'll wear this nanonutrient
garment that will, from now on,

00:41:48.420 --> 00:41:52.590 align:middle line:84%
patrol the inside of your body,
looking for any irregularities.

00:41:52.590 --> 00:41:55.300 align:middle line:84%
Anything that is found will
be cleaned up or treated

00:41:55.300 --> 00:41:57.450 align:middle line:90%
by some kind of pharmaceutical.

00:41:57.450 --> 00:41:59.950 align:middle line:84%
And this is where suddenly,
people get excited

00:41:59.950 --> 00:42:03.490 align:middle line:84%
because wait a minute, this
is how Google transitions

00:42:03.490 --> 00:42:06.970 align:middle line:84%
from a search engine to a
company that is in actuality

00:42:06.970 --> 00:42:08.510 align:middle line:84%
in the immortality
business and they

00:42:08.510 --> 00:42:11.670 align:middle line:84%
promise that you can live
to be 200 to 500 years old.

00:42:11.670 --> 00:42:13.399 align:middle line:90%
But what's the trade off?

00:42:13.399 --> 00:42:15.690 align:middle line:84%
The trade off of is that
there's a computer in Mountain

00:42:15.690 --> 00:42:18.480 align:middle line:84%
View, California that knows
exactly where you are,

00:42:18.480 --> 00:42:23.520 align:middle line:84%
what you're thinking even before
you do and will be ultimately,

00:42:23.520 --> 00:42:26.530 align:middle line:84%
in total control
of your well-being

00:42:26.530 --> 00:42:29.350 align:middle line:84%
and we'll certainly be
limiting you in any way

00:42:29.350 --> 00:42:30.590 align:middle line:90%
that they potentially can.

00:42:30.590 --> 00:42:31.590 align:middle line:90%
That's the danger of it.

00:42:31.590 --> 00:42:35.310 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Indeed, and in
their case, their wives--

00:42:35.310 --> 00:42:38.700 align:middle line:84%
I don't know if they're still
wives or ex-wives-- 23andMe,

00:42:38.700 --> 00:42:42.300 align:middle line:84%
both of the men are married
to the two partners of 23andMe

00:42:42.300 --> 00:42:46.040 align:middle line:84%
the two women are,
where freely for $89

00:42:46.040 --> 00:42:49.350 align:middle line:84%
giving all of our DNA
information to them.

00:42:49.350 --> 00:42:51.970 align:middle line:10%
And that, I'm wondering
what is the interface

00:42:51.970 --> 00:42:54.450 align:middle line:10%
between the amount of DNA
those women have gathered

00:42:54.450 --> 00:42:58.020 align:middle line:10%
on all of us,
voluntarily, for profit,

00:42:58.020 --> 00:43:00.750 align:middle line:10%
feeding back into the
system that the Google

00:43:00.750 --> 00:43:03.610 align:middle line:10%
boys and their DARPA
partners are creating?

00:43:03.610 --> 00:43:04.700 align:middle line:90%
>>HENRY: Yeah, exactly.

00:43:04.700 --> 00:43:07.030 align:middle line:84%
I don't know what
the end game is.

00:43:07.030 --> 00:43:11.280 align:middle line:84%
I don't know if it's ultimately
to entice us into our avatar

00:43:11.280 --> 00:43:15.080 align:middle line:84%
bodies, the holographic
bodies and just completely do

00:43:15.080 --> 00:43:17.900 align:middle line:84%
away with our physical
existence altogether.

00:43:17.900 --> 00:43:21.690 align:middle line:84%
I don't know if ultimately,
it's some giant soul snatching

00:43:21.690 --> 00:43:23.040 align:middle line:90%
program.

00:43:23.040 --> 00:43:24.640 align:middle line:90%
Maybe they're the good guys.

00:43:24.640 --> 00:43:26.480 align:middle line:84%
Maybe they've got
it all figured out

00:43:26.480 --> 00:43:29.730 align:middle line:84%
and they've got a way that all
nine billion of us in 10 years

00:43:29.730 --> 00:43:33.714 align:middle line:84%
will ultimately be able to live
to be 300, 400, 500 years old.

00:43:33.714 --> 00:43:35.130 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Yeah,
but wait a minute.

00:43:35.130 --> 00:43:36.610 align:middle line:90%
OK, it doesn't work like that.

00:43:36.610 --> 00:43:38.332 align:middle line:84%
These are expensive
technologies.

00:43:38.332 --> 00:43:39.540 align:middle line:90%
These aren't intended for us.

00:43:39.540 --> 00:43:42.415 align:middle line:84%
>>HENRY: No, no, no, no,
Kurzweil, himself says,

00:43:42.415 --> 00:43:45.920 align:middle line:84%
last year, by 2020,
these technologies

00:43:45.920 --> 00:43:49.710 align:middle line:84%
will be 10,000 times more
powerful and far less expensive

00:43:49.710 --> 00:43:50.510 align:middle line:90%
than you think.

00:43:50.510 --> 00:43:51.850 align:middle line:90%
They'll be cheap.

00:43:51.850 --> 00:43:53.020 align:middle line:10%
It will be ubiquitous.

00:43:53.020 --> 00:43:55.040 align:middle line:10%
Everybody will want it
and be able to have it.

00:43:55.040 --> 00:43:59.130 align:middle line:10%
>>REGINA: OK, so this brings
up much larger issues.

00:43:59.130 --> 00:44:01.760 align:middle line:84%
A planet with no
disease, a planet

00:44:01.760 --> 00:44:04.230 align:middle line:84%
where bodies live
300 years or longer--

00:44:04.230 --> 00:44:06.480 align:middle line:84%
>>HENRY: No wonder we've got
to go into other planets.

00:44:06.480 --> 00:44:07.280 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Exactly.

00:44:07.280 --> 00:44:10.870 align:middle line:10%
The planet with these
kinds of resources.

00:44:10.870 --> 00:44:15.330 align:middle line:84%
What could possibly be driving
this, in the larger sense,

00:44:15.330 --> 00:44:18.940 align:middle line:84%
to keep human beings on
the planet that long,

00:44:18.940 --> 00:44:21.200 align:middle line:84%
rather than the elite keeping
themselves on the planet

00:44:21.200 --> 00:44:22.000 align:middle line:90%
that long?

00:44:22.000 --> 00:44:24.740 align:middle line:84%
How are the rest of
the human species

00:44:24.740 --> 00:44:27.635 align:middle line:90%
useful to them in that way?

00:44:27.635 --> 00:44:29.760 align:middle line:84%
>>HENRY: Well, let's go
back to our Archons, right?

00:44:29.760 --> 00:44:31.440 align:middle line:10%
Then the theory is
that the Archons

00:44:31.440 --> 00:44:34.780 align:middle line:10%
are harvesting something
from these human batteries.

00:44:34.780 --> 00:44:36.995 align:middle line:84%
Loosh is a substance
that's mentioned.

00:44:36.995 --> 00:44:38.120 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Talk about Loosh.

00:44:38.120 --> 00:44:40.050 align:middle line:84%
>>HENRY: Loosh is a
spiritual substance

00:44:40.050 --> 00:44:42.120 align:middle line:84%
that's sort of like crack
cocaine in other regions of the

00:44:42.120 --> 00:44:42.920 align:middle line:90%
galaxy.

00:44:42.920 --> 00:44:44.710 align:middle line:84%
They harvest it
from the human body

00:44:44.710 --> 00:44:47.140 align:middle line:84%
and distribute to
regions of the galaxy

00:44:47.140 --> 00:44:49.970 align:middle line:84%
where they don't
have fear, basically.

00:44:49.970 --> 00:44:52.760 align:middle line:84%
And so perhaps that's
the endgame here.

00:44:52.760 --> 00:44:54.180 align:middle line:90%
Is to enhance--

00:44:54.180 --> 00:44:55.930 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Keep the
humans alive long

00:44:55.930 --> 00:44:58.650 align:middle line:84%
enough and populated in
enough different places

00:44:58.650 --> 00:45:01.860 align:middle line:84%
that that realm or
dimension of beings

00:45:01.860 --> 00:45:04.320 align:middle line:84%
can have access to
these substances.

00:45:04.320 --> 00:45:05.120 align:middle line:90%
For what?

00:45:05.120 --> 00:45:06.840 align:middle line:90%
For their sustenance?

00:45:06.840 --> 00:45:08.685 align:middle line:90%
>>HENRY: Addictions, perhaps.

00:45:08.685 --> 00:45:09.810 align:middle line:90%
These are all suppositions.

00:45:09.810 --> 00:45:12.260 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: I mean, if you
take pure fear, that's

00:45:12.260 --> 00:45:13.190 align:middle line:90%
an adrenaline rush.

00:45:13.190 --> 00:45:15.100 align:middle line:90%
>>HENRY: Absolutely, absolutely.

00:45:15.100 --> 00:45:18.010 align:middle line:84%
And if fear doesn't exist in
other realms or other planets,

00:45:18.010 --> 00:45:20.230 align:middle line:84%
then, hey, you've got
yourself a rare commodity

00:45:20.230 --> 00:45:22.445 align:middle line:84%
if people can get
addicted to it as we are.

00:45:22.445 --> 00:45:23.820 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Because
it's really not

00:45:23.820 --> 00:45:27.210 align:middle line:84%
making any sense that
the quote, "power elite,"

00:45:27.210 --> 00:45:30.580 align:middle line:84%
who believe they have
ultimate power over all of us

00:45:30.580 --> 00:45:32.976 align:middle line:84%
would keep the species
intact and alive.

00:45:32.976 --> 00:45:34.850 align:middle line:84%
Because essentially what
you're talking about

00:45:34.850 --> 00:45:38.520 align:middle line:84%
these nanobots is something as
profound as the end of cancer,

00:45:38.520 --> 00:45:39.320 align:middle line:90%
for one.

00:45:39.320 --> 00:45:40.950 align:middle line:84%
>>HENRY: In our
generation, yeah.

00:45:40.950 --> 00:45:41.780 align:middle line:90%
End of all disease.

00:45:41.780 --> 00:45:42.988 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: End of all disease.

00:45:42.988 --> 00:45:45.690 align:middle line:84%
>>HENRY: And also,
the accentuation

00:45:45.690 --> 00:45:48.310 align:middle line:84%
of superhuman powers
where everybody will have

00:45:48.310 --> 00:45:49.820 align:middle line:90%
vastly advanced intelligence.

00:45:49.820 --> 00:45:51.630 align:middle line:84%
And that's Google's
promise that if you

00:45:51.630 --> 00:45:53.520 align:middle line:84%
will take their
smart dust and get

00:45:53.520 --> 00:45:56.840 align:middle line:84%
with the synthetic
neural cortex program,

00:45:56.840 --> 00:45:59.120 align:middle line:84%
you will have the brain
capacity not of one human

00:45:59.120 --> 00:46:01.536 align:middle line:90%
but of seven billion humans.

00:46:01.536 --> 00:46:02.910 align:middle line:84%
To me, this is
sort of like Satan

00:46:02.910 --> 00:46:05.035 align:middle line:84%
taking Jesus up to the top
of the tower and saying,

00:46:05.035 --> 00:46:06.730 align:middle line:90%
this can all be yours.

00:46:06.730 --> 00:46:08.800 align:middle line:90%
But what's the cost going to be?

00:46:08.800 --> 00:46:10.730 align:middle line:90%
The cost will be your free will.

00:46:10.730 --> 00:46:14.460 align:middle line:84%
The cost will be ultimately,
potentially, your soul.

00:46:14.460 --> 00:46:17.117 align:middle line:84%
That's what is ultimately
on the line here.

00:46:17.117 --> 00:46:19.200 align:middle line:84%
Because again, they don't
believe you have a soul.

00:46:19.200 --> 00:46:21.650 align:middle line:84%
They believe your soul is
the accumulation everything

00:46:21.650 --> 00:46:24.370 align:middle line:84%
that PRISM's recorded and
the NSA is listening in on.

00:46:24.370 --> 00:46:25.070 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Well,
that's what I was just

00:46:25.070 --> 00:46:26.240 align:middle line:90%
going to ask you about next.

00:46:26.240 --> 00:46:27.380 align:middle line:90%
Explain PRISM.

00:46:27.380 --> 00:46:31.260 align:middle line:84%
>>HENRY: Yeah, well, PRISM is
a NSA program based in Utah,

00:46:31.260 --> 00:46:35.660 align:middle line:84%
where they record every
keystroke, every Google

00:46:35.660 --> 00:46:41.250 align:middle line:84%
search, every online activity
you have is recorded forever.

00:46:41.250 --> 00:46:44.510 align:middle line:84%
And the US government
has access to that data

00:46:44.510 --> 00:46:46.530 align:middle line:84%
and they believe it's
public because they get it

00:46:46.530 --> 00:46:50.360 align:middle line:84%
before it goes to Google
or Yahoo or other places.

00:46:50.360 --> 00:46:53.374 align:middle line:84%
They think it's all
public information.

00:46:53.374 --> 00:46:55.290 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And the
implications are interesting

00:46:55.290 --> 00:46:59.490 align:middle line:84%
there because that's where the
work of Cliff High and others

00:46:59.490 --> 00:47:01.730 align:middle line:84%
come in because
they're able to do

00:47:01.730 --> 00:47:06.310 align:middle line:84%
this en masse at a degree beyond
what Cliff and others can do.

00:47:06.310 --> 00:47:11.764 align:middle line:84%
To read these mass algorithms
of our collective psyche

00:47:11.764 --> 00:47:13.930 align:middle line:84%
and that's really-- it's
not so much-- I don't think

00:47:13.930 --> 00:47:16.490 align:middle line:84%
it's so much about
collecting individual data,

00:47:16.490 --> 00:47:17.974 align:middle line:84%
unless you're a
person of interest

00:47:17.974 --> 00:47:19.890 align:middle line:84%
and there aren't that
many people of interest,

00:47:19.890 --> 00:47:22.040 align:middle line:90%
honestly, on the planet to them.

00:47:22.040 --> 00:47:23.990 align:middle line:84%
But it's of great
interest that they

00:47:23.990 --> 00:47:30.070 align:middle line:84%
collect our collective fears,
understandings, beliefs,

00:47:30.070 --> 00:47:32.920 align:middle line:84%
reactions in particular,
problem reaction solution,

00:47:32.920 --> 00:47:34.440 align:middle line:90%
as David Icke would put it.

00:47:34.440 --> 00:47:35.250 align:middle line:90%
>>HENRY: Right.

00:47:35.250 --> 00:47:36.291 align:middle line:90%
Yeah, a couple of things.

00:47:36.291 --> 00:47:37.790 align:middle line:84%
First of all, this
is Judgment Day

00:47:37.790 --> 00:47:40.250 align:middle line:84%
because the Book of Revelation
says that at Judgment Day

00:47:40.250 --> 00:47:43.370 align:middle line:84%
every errant word you've
spoken will be accounted for.

00:47:43.370 --> 00:47:45.920 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Oh, that
puts a new spin on it.

00:47:45.920 --> 00:47:48.430 align:middle line:84%
>>HENRY: So be careful where
you're searching online, right?

00:47:48.430 --> 00:47:49.270 align:middle line:90%
You will be accountable.

00:47:49.270 --> 00:47:49.910 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And what
you're saying online.

00:47:49.910 --> 00:47:51.535 align:middle line:84%
>>HENRY: And what
you're saying online.

00:47:51.535 --> 00:47:54.850 align:middle line:84%
And two, it suggests some
kind of massive experiment.

00:47:54.850 --> 00:47:56.600 align:middle line:84%
That we're being
monitored and tested

00:47:56.600 --> 00:48:00.620 align:middle line:84%
by some exterior
or external agency,

00:48:00.620 --> 00:48:03.830 align:middle line:84%
probably extraplanetary
that is driving all of this

00:48:03.830 --> 00:48:06.590 align:middle line:90%
to see what we'll do with it.

00:48:06.590 --> 00:48:10.350 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So that's where, when
we look to the world of sci-fi,

00:48:10.350 --> 00:48:12.410 align:middle line:84%
which has been
heavily programmed,

00:48:12.410 --> 00:48:14.870 align:middle line:84%
give us an idea
of what you would

00:48:14.870 --> 00:48:19.160 align:middle line:84%
look to as say, books or
films, which are basically

00:48:19.160 --> 00:48:21.040 align:middle line:90%
interrupters of this.

00:48:21.040 --> 00:48:23.680 align:middle line:84%
That would say
people, pay attention.

00:48:23.680 --> 00:48:24.630 align:middle line:90%
Wake up.

00:48:24.630 --> 00:48:27.340 align:middle line:84%
I mean, we know that "Animal
Farm" was one, right?

00:48:27.340 --> 00:48:30.820 align:middle line:84%
As it turns out, it
was a warning, right?

00:48:30.820 --> 00:48:33.250 align:middle line:84%
But what are some others in
more modern times that you

00:48:33.250 --> 00:48:35.720 align:middle line:84%
would turn to to say,
this is the message.

00:48:35.720 --> 00:48:36.520 align:middle line:90%
People, wake up.

00:48:36.520 --> 00:48:37.830 align:middle line:84%
And then I would
say, well, how did

00:48:37.830 --> 00:48:39.310 align:middle line:84%
they ever get funding in
Hollywood with that message?

00:48:39.310 --> 00:48:41.518 align:middle line:84%
>>HENRY: I can't think of
one, to be honest with you.

00:48:41.518 --> 00:48:42.970 align:middle line:90%
I really can't think of one.

00:48:42.970 --> 00:48:44.240 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: No disrupters.

00:48:44.240 --> 00:48:45.040 align:middle line:90%
>>HENRY: No, no.

00:48:45.040 --> 00:48:47.080 align:middle line:84%
They're all painting
this vision of how great

00:48:47.080 --> 00:48:50.910 align:middle line:84%
it's going to be in a way with
a little bit of subtext that

00:48:50.910 --> 00:48:52.580 align:middle line:90%
isn't this awful.

00:48:52.580 --> 00:48:56.380 align:middle line:10%
But at the same time, there's a
message that it's unstoppable.

00:48:56.380 --> 00:49:00.340 align:middle line:84%
What I think we need is
a clear demonstration

00:49:00.340 --> 00:49:05.750 align:middle line:84%
in film of the alternative
view, of how the human body can

00:49:05.750 --> 00:49:08.320 align:middle line:90%
be transformed.

00:49:08.320 --> 00:49:10.000 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: How the
human psyche can

00:49:10.000 --> 00:49:13.280 align:middle line:84%
be-- how the human
capability, across the board,

00:49:13.280 --> 00:49:16.540 align:middle line:84%
can be transformed just by
connection with the highest

00:49:16.540 --> 00:49:18.449 align:middle line:90%
aspect of our own intelligence.

00:49:18.449 --> 00:49:19.990 align:middle line:84%
>>HENRY: In my
opinion, I'll tell you

00:49:19.990 --> 00:49:22.380 align:middle line:84%
who has the greatest
opportunity right now

00:49:22.380 --> 00:49:24.220 align:middle line:84%
to do this very thing
I'm talking about.

00:49:24.220 --> 00:49:25.020 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Who?

00:49:25.020 --> 00:49:26.404 align:middle line:90%
>>HENRY: Mel Gibson.

00:49:26.404 --> 00:49:27.320 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Tell me why.

00:49:27.320 --> 00:49:29.840 align:middle line:84%
>>HENRY: Because he's
doing it in a new film

00:49:29.840 --> 00:49:31.080 align:middle line:90%
called, "Resurrection."

00:49:31.080 --> 00:49:32.502 align:middle line:84%
It's the sequel
to "The Passion."

00:49:32.502 --> 00:49:34.210 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Is he getting
back in Hollywood

00:49:34.210 --> 00:49:35.837 align:middle line:90%
after all the kerfuffle there?

00:49:35.837 --> 00:49:36.920 align:middle line:90%
>>HENRY: Supposedly, yeah.

00:49:36.920 --> 00:49:37.720 align:middle line:90%
That's the idea.

00:49:37.720 --> 00:49:40.090 align:middle line:84%
And so, I'm looking
at that saying, wow.

00:49:40.090 --> 00:49:43.730 align:middle line:84%
OK, if Mel Gibson-- in
"Passion of the Christ,"

00:49:43.730 --> 00:49:49.860 align:middle line:84%
he gave us a visceral experience
of the suffering, right?

00:49:49.860 --> 00:49:52.630 align:middle line:84%
What if I could
have lunch with them

00:49:52.630 --> 00:49:57.770 align:middle line:84%
and show him a slideshow of
the illumination of Christ?

00:49:57.770 --> 00:50:00.160 align:middle line:84%
After the Crucifixion
comes Resurrection.

00:50:00.160 --> 00:50:03.640 align:middle line:84%
And what if he could somehow
transmit the power of love

00:50:03.640 --> 00:50:05.510 align:middle line:84%
through this movie
and you have hundreds

00:50:05.510 --> 00:50:08.460 align:middle line:84%
of millions of people that
go and experience what

00:50:08.460 --> 00:50:12.710 align:middle line:84%
it's like for a human
to dissolve into light

00:50:12.710 --> 00:50:18.050 align:middle line:84%
and to manifest their original
spiritual essence of love.

00:50:18.050 --> 00:50:20.420 align:middle line:84%
That would be a
profound experience

00:50:20.420 --> 00:50:21.870 align:middle line:84%
and that's a
profound opportunity

00:50:21.870 --> 00:50:23.650 align:middle line:84%
that he has right
there at his fingertips

00:50:23.650 --> 00:50:25.470 align:middle line:90%
to be able to show that.

00:50:25.470 --> 00:50:27.890 align:middle line:10%
And with the technology
we have today even going

00:50:27.890 --> 00:50:32.080 align:middle line:10%
into a virtual reality sense, it
would be a stunner, absolutely

00:50:32.080 --> 00:50:32.880 align:middle line:10%
a stunner.

00:50:32.880 --> 00:50:34.296 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: It would
be, and I would

00:50:34.296 --> 00:50:37.560 align:middle line:84%
say, through a slightly
different lens even, what

00:50:37.560 --> 00:50:41.980 align:middle line:84%
about the notion of activating
our connection with the highest

00:50:41.980 --> 00:50:42.955 align:middle line:90%
aspect of ourselves.

00:50:42.955 --> 00:50:45.240 align:middle line:84%
You can call it
a soul, a spirit,

00:50:45.240 --> 00:50:48.280 align:middle line:84%
that has all that knowledge
already embedded in it.

00:50:48.280 --> 00:50:50.740 align:middle line:84%
We have the knowledge embedded
if we really wanted it

00:50:50.740 --> 00:50:52.650 align:middle line:90%
for extreme longevity.

00:50:52.650 --> 00:50:53.640 align:middle line:90%
It's already there.

00:50:53.640 --> 00:50:56.020 align:middle line:84%
There are things we can do
even in this physical world.

00:50:56.020 --> 00:50:58.300 align:middle line:84%
There are ways the
mind, the thought forms

00:50:58.300 --> 00:51:00.140 align:middle line:84%
interface with the
physical reality

00:51:00.140 --> 00:51:03.326 align:middle line:84%
to change our-- miracles,
you see them all the time.

00:51:03.326 --> 00:51:04.200 align:middle line:90%
They're not miracles.

00:51:04.200 --> 00:51:05.960 align:middle line:84%
They're just part
of our potential

00:51:05.960 --> 00:51:10.370 align:middle line:84%
to live that incredibly
exquisite experience even

00:51:10.370 --> 00:51:11.727 align:middle line:90%
in the body while we're here.

00:51:11.727 --> 00:51:13.310 align:middle line:84%
>>HENRY: Well, and
that is what drives

00:51:13.310 --> 00:51:15.720 align:middle line:90%
my show on Gaia, "Arcanum."

00:51:15.720 --> 00:51:17.770 align:middle line:84%
This belief, this
understanding by artists,

00:51:17.770 --> 00:51:19.730 align:middle line:90%
however they knew it.

00:51:19.730 --> 00:51:22.500 align:middle line:84%
Art, especially images
of transfiguration,

00:51:22.500 --> 00:51:28.070 align:middle line:84%
or humans morphing into light,
can activate neurocenters

00:51:28.070 --> 00:51:31.290 align:middle line:84%
within our brain that can
trigger this transformation

00:51:31.290 --> 00:51:32.330 align:middle line:90%
within ourself.

00:51:32.330 --> 00:51:33.690 align:middle line:90%
This is not speculation.

00:51:33.690 --> 00:51:37.380 align:middle line:84%
This is neuroscience
that says this happens.

00:51:37.380 --> 00:51:40.060 align:middle line:84%
That when we're looking
at a piece of art,

00:51:40.060 --> 00:51:42.130 align:middle line:84%
of say, Jesus
transfiguring into light

00:51:42.130 --> 00:51:45.580 align:middle line:84%
or a Tibetan image
Padmasambhava, the guru,

00:51:45.580 --> 00:51:48.340 align:middle line:84%
manifesting the
rainbow body of light,

00:51:48.340 --> 00:51:52.064 align:middle line:84%
our neurocenters are firing
as if that is happening to us.

00:51:52.064 --> 00:51:54.480 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Have you worked with
Joe Dispenza on any of this

00:51:54.480 --> 00:51:54.710 align:middle line:90%
yet?

00:51:54.710 --> 00:51:56.310 align:middle line:10%
>>HENRY: No, I would love to.

00:51:56.310 --> 00:51:57.120 align:middle line:10%
Oh, my gosh.

00:51:57.120 --> 00:51:57.760 align:middle line:10%
That's a dream.

00:51:57.760 --> 00:51:59.670 align:middle line:10%
>>REGINA: I'm just
suggesting because I have him

00:51:59.670 --> 00:52:00.350 align:middle line:10%
on now and then.

00:52:00.350 --> 00:52:02.000 align:middle line:84%
That might be great if you
two could interface on this.

00:52:02.000 --> 00:52:02.875 align:middle line:90%
>>HENRY: Oh, my gosh.

00:52:02.875 --> 00:52:05.220 align:middle line:90%
That would be a dream come true.

00:52:05.220 --> 00:52:06.020 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Do it.

00:52:06.020 --> 00:52:08.650 align:middle line:84%
>>HENRY: I don't know the extent
of his work but what I've seen,

00:52:08.650 --> 00:52:09.020 align:middle line:90%
it's like,

00:52:09.020 --> 00:52:09.300 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: He can--

00:52:09.300 --> 00:52:09.910 align:middle line:90%
>>HENRY: Joe, he's --

00:52:09.910 --> 00:52:10.826 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Hook him up.

00:52:10.826 --> 00:52:13.140 align:middle line:84%
>>HENRY: Yeah, he's got to
see this art because there's

00:52:13.140 --> 00:52:16.560 align:middle line:84%
a whole neuroscience here that
these PhD's and art history

00:52:16.560 --> 00:52:19.091 align:middle line:84%
know what is happening
internally as we're

00:52:19.091 --> 00:52:20.090 align:middle line:90%
looking at these images.

00:52:20.090 --> 00:52:20.155 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: They
have the capability

00:52:20.155 --> 00:52:22.799 align:middle line:84%
to look at the brain
mapping as it's happening

00:52:22.799 --> 00:52:24.340 align:middle line:84%
and the parts of
the brain firing up.

00:52:24.340 --> 00:52:26.496 align:middle line:84%
They can watch it
live, real time.

00:52:26.496 --> 00:52:27.620 align:middle line:90%
>>HENRY: So we can do this.

00:52:27.620 --> 00:52:29.729 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: A new
project, absolutely.

00:52:29.729 --> 00:52:31.270 align:middle line:84%
>>HENRY: Because
that's the solution.

00:52:31.270 --> 00:52:32.070 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: It is.

00:52:32.070 --> 00:52:34.010 align:middle line:84%
And things that
are as simple as--

00:52:34.010 --> 00:52:37.146 align:middle line:84%
and people think it shouldn't
be so simple but it is.

00:52:37.146 --> 00:52:38.270 align:middle line:90%
>>HENRY: It is that simple.

00:52:38.270 --> 00:52:39.660 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: A lot of people
don't understand the word love

00:52:39.660 --> 00:52:40.460 align:middle line:90%
really.

00:52:40.460 --> 00:52:42.010 align:middle line:84%
They know what
sentimentality means.

00:52:42.010 --> 00:52:45.830 align:middle line:90%
I love, chocolate ice cream.

00:52:45.830 --> 00:52:46.930 align:middle line:90%
That's desire.

00:52:46.930 --> 00:52:50.970 align:middle line:84%
But if you take the notions of
even two other things, which

00:52:50.970 --> 00:52:54.390 align:middle line:84%
interface with what you're
saying, beauty in all

00:52:54.390 --> 00:52:58.230 align:middle line:84%
forms and see that your life
includes beauty in all forms.

00:52:58.230 --> 00:53:01.420 align:middle line:84%
And then just took on the
discipline of compassion.

00:53:01.420 --> 00:53:04.050 align:middle line:84%
Between just those two
things alone, fear's

00:53:04.050 --> 00:53:05.787 align:middle line:84%
now out of the
picture pretty much.

00:53:05.787 --> 00:53:06.870 align:middle line:90%
>>HENRY: Yeah, I call it--

00:53:06.870 --> 00:53:08.080 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: We're not
so controllable.

00:53:08.080 --> 00:53:08.996 align:middle line:90%
>>HENRY: You're right.

00:53:08.996 --> 00:53:12.150 align:middle line:84%
I call it tapping our
ascension intelligence.

00:53:12.150 --> 00:53:14.590 align:middle line:10%
It's the antidote to
artificial intelligence.

00:53:14.590 --> 00:53:17.580 align:middle line:10%
Because as you climb
the ascension ladder

00:53:17.580 --> 00:53:20.780 align:middle line:10%
and you start to develop
the mindset of the avatars,

00:53:20.780 --> 00:53:22.550 align:middle line:10%
you're connecting with
the art or whoever,

00:53:22.550 --> 00:53:25.430 align:middle line:10%
you realize, I've just
transcended this technology.

00:53:25.430 --> 00:53:26.790 align:middle line:90%
I don't need that anymore.

00:53:26.790 --> 00:53:27.720 align:middle line:90%
I can do this.

00:53:27.720 --> 00:53:29.136 align:middle line:84%
Because what we're
trying to do is

00:53:29.136 --> 00:53:30.790 align:middle line:84%
mimic what the avatars
and angels were

00:53:30.790 --> 00:53:32.275 align:middle line:90%
doing with this technology.

00:53:32.275 --> 00:53:33.140 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And we're
capable of it.

00:53:33.140 --> 00:53:34.764 align:middle line:84%
>>HENRY: And we're
capable of doing it.

00:53:34.764 --> 00:53:37.110 align:middle line:90%
So this is the answer.

00:53:37.110 --> 00:53:38.590 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: It is the answer.

00:53:38.590 --> 00:53:40.660 align:middle line:84%
I'm so lit up over
this conversation.

00:53:40.660 --> 00:53:42.370 align:middle line:84%
And I hope you and
Joe get together.

00:53:42.370 --> 00:53:43.000 align:middle line:90%
>>HENRY: Oh, I do, too.

00:53:43.000 --> 00:53:43.420 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: And Jeff Fanning.

00:53:43.420 --> 00:53:44.220 align:middle line:90%
Oh, my gosh.

00:53:44.220 --> 00:53:46.420 align:middle line:84%
I'm sure people here can
make that happen easily.

00:53:46.420 --> 00:53:49.670 align:middle line:10%
>>HENRY: That would be truly
a dream come true on my end,

00:53:49.670 --> 00:53:51.850 align:middle line:10%
to be able to show him
this and the evidence

00:53:51.850 --> 00:53:52.650 align:middle line:10%
that I've gathered.

00:53:52.650 --> 00:53:54.655 align:middle line:10%
Because he'll light up
and he'll absolutely know

00:53:54.655 --> 00:53:55.780 align:middle line:10%
exactly what to do with it.

00:53:55.780 --> 00:53:57.020 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: It's so exciting.

00:53:57.020 --> 00:53:58.520 align:middle line:10%
And thank you for
this and thank you

00:53:58.520 --> 00:54:00.220 align:middle line:10%
for being brave
enough to come on

00:54:00.220 --> 00:54:03.060 align:middle line:10%
and talk about this after
having been under fire

00:54:03.060 --> 00:54:04.566 align:middle line:10%
for being misrepresented

00:54:04.566 --> 00:54:06.530 align:middle line:10%
>>HENRY: Well, thank
you for the opportunity.

00:54:06.530 --> 00:54:09.270 align:middle line:84%
And thank you, everybody,
for participating today.

00:54:09.270 --> 00:54:10.350 align:middle line:90%
And now you're in.

00:54:10.350 --> 00:54:12.246 align:middle line:90%
Welcome and let's change it.

00:54:12.246 --> 00:54:13.120 align:middle line:10%
>>REGINA: Absolutely.

00:54:13.120 --> 00:54:14.210 align:middle line:10%
It's within our power.

00:54:14.210 --> 00:54:15.410 align:middle line:10%
I'm so on board with you.

00:54:15.410 --> 00:54:16.210 align:middle line:90%
Thank you, William.

00:54:16.210 --> 00:54:17.230 align:middle line:90%
>>HENRY: Great, my pleasure.

00:54:17.230 --> 00:54:18.646 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: One only
knows how we're

00:54:18.646 --> 00:54:20.500 align:middle line:84%
going to respond
when our time comes

00:54:20.500 --> 00:54:22.710 align:middle line:84%
to make these kinds of
decisions about our own health

00:54:22.710 --> 00:54:23.510 align:middle line:90%
and well-being.

00:54:23.510 --> 00:54:25.980 align:middle line:84%
This is where spiritual
principals meet our desire

00:54:25.980 --> 00:54:29.590 align:middle line:84%
for immortality and more
accurately, our fear of death.

00:54:29.590 --> 00:54:31.590 align:middle line:10%
