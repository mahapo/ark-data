00:00:27.589 --> 00:00:29.380 align:middle line:10%
>>REGINA MEREDITH:
Throughout human history

00:00:29.380 --> 00:00:31.300 align:middle line:10%
we've been searching
for the holy grail,

00:00:31.300 --> 00:00:35.610 align:middle line:10%
the fountain of youth, which is
to slow down the aging process.

00:00:35.610 --> 00:00:37.880 align:middle line:84%
The exciting new science
of telomere research

00:00:37.880 --> 00:00:39.590 align:middle line:90%
may be offering us some hope.

00:00:39.590 --> 00:00:41.620 align:middle line:84%
And today we have
Dr. Ed Park with us

00:00:41.620 --> 00:00:44.980 align:middle line:84%
here to talk about the
hard core science of it.

00:00:44.980 --> 00:00:47.430 align:middle line:84%
We also had a conversation
with two men featured

00:00:47.430 --> 00:00:51.000 align:middle line:84%
in the movie, "The
Immortalists," Dr. Bill Andrews

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:53.190 align:middle line:84%
and Terry Grossman,
where we got into some

00:00:53.190 --> 00:00:55.080 align:middle line:84%
of the philosophical
aspects of what

00:00:55.080 --> 00:00:58.420 align:middle line:84%
happens with immortality and
a little bit of the science.

00:00:58.420 --> 00:01:00.000 align:middle line:84%
So today what I want
to do is pick up

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:01.600 align:middle line:90%
with a bunch of the science.

00:01:01.600 --> 00:01:04.069 align:middle line:84%
But first, as with
them, I would like it

00:01:04.069 --> 00:01:06.810 align:middle line:84%
if our viewers could get to
know you a little better,

00:01:06.810 --> 00:01:09.870 align:middle line:84%
so let's start
out with where you

00:01:09.870 --> 00:01:12.220 align:middle line:84%
entered into the world of
medicine to begin with.

00:01:12.220 --> 00:01:14.160 align:middle line:84%
And it's always-- with
the people I interview,

00:01:14.160 --> 00:01:16.540 align:middle line:84%
it's always an interesting
and odd pathway

00:01:16.540 --> 00:01:17.950 align:middle line:90%
to get where they are now.

00:01:17.950 --> 00:01:21.954 align:middle line:84%
>>DR. ED PARK: So I was born
into a family of doctors,

00:01:21.954 --> 00:01:22.870 align:middle line:90%
I guess you could say.

00:01:22.870 --> 00:01:25.610 align:middle line:10%
My mom was a nurse and my dad
said, well, go to med school.

00:01:25.610 --> 00:01:28.240 align:middle line:10%
So we did that, fulfilled
the programming,

00:01:28.240 --> 00:01:32.300 align:middle line:10%
and then into a normal
middle class life.

00:01:32.300 --> 00:01:34.100 align:middle line:10%
Somewhere at the
age of 39, my dad

00:01:34.100 --> 00:01:35.947 align:middle line:10%
was diagnosed with brain cancer.

00:01:35.947 --> 00:01:37.530 align:middle line:84%
And like most people,
you don't really

00:01:37.530 --> 00:01:42.010 align:middle line:84%
worry about getting old or sick
until it touches you closely.

00:01:42.010 --> 00:01:43.620 align:middle line:84%
So I googled on
the internet what

00:01:43.620 --> 00:01:45.590 align:middle line:84%
causes people to
get old and sick,

00:01:45.590 --> 00:01:47.850 align:middle line:84%
now it seemed like a
real problem to me.

00:01:47.850 --> 00:01:50.590 align:middle line:84%
And there are only like five
theories, and four of them

00:01:50.590 --> 00:01:51.790 align:middle line:90%
didn't seem very good.

00:01:51.790 --> 00:01:54.580 align:middle line:84%
So I researched
this telomere thing.

00:01:54.580 --> 00:01:57.310 align:middle line:84%
At that time, I thought, boy,
this is really interesting.

00:01:57.310 --> 00:01:58.430 align:middle line:90%
It sounds true.

00:01:58.430 --> 00:02:00.430 align:middle line:84%
I even wrote a screenplay
and a graphic novel

00:02:00.430 --> 00:02:03.350 align:middle line:84%
based on a future where people
could take something called

00:02:03.350 --> 00:02:06.050 align:middle line:84%
a telomerase activator
and stay young

00:02:06.050 --> 00:02:09.169 align:middle line:84%
and what would that mean for
the social implications-- which

00:02:09.169 --> 00:02:12.240 align:middle line:84%
a year later ironically,
such a thing came to market.

00:02:12.240 --> 00:02:14.050 align:middle line:84%
So I became one of
the first 19 people

00:02:14.050 --> 00:02:16.330 align:middle line:84%
to take this
telomerase activator,

00:02:16.330 --> 00:02:17.760 align:middle line:84%
and it immediately
transformed me.

00:02:17.760 --> 00:02:21.460 align:middle line:84%
And that kind of set me on the
journey away from traditional

00:02:21.460 --> 00:02:22.757 align:middle line:90%
allo-medicine or--

00:02:22.757 --> 00:02:23.340 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:02:23.340 --> 00:02:24.401 align:middle line:90%
Allopathic medicine.

00:02:24.401 --> 00:02:24.900 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:02:24.900 --> 00:02:26.320 align:middle line:84%
Can we go back
just a little bit?

00:02:26.320 --> 00:02:28.370 align:middle line:84%
I like some of the
early work you did,

00:02:28.370 --> 00:02:30.200 align:middle line:84%
where you had a chance
to go to Mongolia.

00:02:30.200 --> 00:02:33.520 align:middle line:84%
But again, the pressure to
stay on, do the right thing,

00:02:33.520 --> 00:02:36.660 align:middle line:84%
be a good spouse, a
good son, a good father,

00:02:36.660 --> 00:02:38.810 align:middle line:84%
and stay with your medical
career was always there.

00:02:38.810 --> 00:02:41.080 align:middle line:84%
But let's talk
about what happened

00:02:41.080 --> 00:02:44.170 align:middle line:84%
with, I think it was Jim Kim,
when you first met Jim Kim

00:02:44.170 --> 00:02:48.220 align:middle line:84%
and what he lit you up about
and the whole journey that

00:02:48.220 --> 00:02:50.830 align:middle line:84%
would have taken you
to Mongolia having

00:02:50.830 --> 00:02:54.860 align:middle line:84%
to do with female reproduction
and IUDs and such.

00:02:54.860 --> 00:02:55.650 align:middle line:90%
>>PARK: Yeah.

00:02:55.650 --> 00:02:59.060 align:middle line:84%
Well, in high school,
I met Jim Kim,

00:02:59.060 --> 00:03:00.900 align:middle line:84%
who's now the president
of the World Bank.

00:03:00.900 --> 00:03:02.850 align:middle line:84%
And he's touched a lot
of people, not just me.

00:03:02.850 --> 00:03:05.950 align:middle line:84%
But he got me fired up about
studying medical anthropology.

00:03:05.950 --> 00:03:09.430 align:middle line:84%
So I thought, well, here's a
great way to impact the world.

00:03:09.430 --> 00:03:11.730 align:middle line:84%
And I love being immersed
in different cultures.

00:03:11.730 --> 00:03:14.750 align:middle line:84%
And so that was my major,
and that was my intent

00:03:14.750 --> 00:03:15.940 align:middle line:90%
through med school.

00:03:15.940 --> 00:03:17.760 align:middle line:84%
And I also got a
master's in public health

00:03:17.760 --> 00:03:20.529 align:middle line:84%
because I figured I would
be a pediatrician working

00:03:20.529 --> 00:03:22.820 align:middle line:84%
internationally, you know,
like Doctors Without Borders

00:03:22.820 --> 00:03:24.030 align:middle line:90%
or something.

00:03:24.030 --> 00:03:29.820 align:middle line:84%
And through the process of
being acculturated to life,

00:03:29.820 --> 00:03:34.010 align:middle line:84%
you know, and
spousehood, there was

00:03:34.010 --> 00:03:35.840 align:middle line:84%
a bit of a different
vision in how

00:03:35.840 --> 00:03:41.310 align:middle line:84%
we would co-create our
lives, so my ex-wife actually

00:03:41.310 --> 00:03:42.430 align:middle line:90%
called an intervention.

00:03:42.430 --> 00:03:43.725 align:middle line:90%
So my parents came down--

00:03:43.725 --> 00:03:45.600 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Well, this
was because you had been

00:03:45.600 --> 00:03:46.940 align:middle line:90%
offered the gig in Mongolia.

00:03:46.940 --> 00:03:47.280 align:middle line:90%
>>PARK: Right.

00:03:47.280 --> 00:03:48.450 align:middle line:84%
To run family
planning for Mongolia.

00:03:48.450 --> 00:03:51.120 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And she couldn't
really see her life blossoming

00:03:51.120 --> 00:03:52.731 align:middle line:90%
in Mongolia, I assume.

00:03:52.731 --> 00:03:53.230 align:middle line:90%
>>PARK: No.

00:03:53.230 --> 00:03:55.440 align:middle line:84%
We were looking at model
homes in Orange County,

00:03:55.440 --> 00:03:59.771 align:middle line:84%
not like Soviet-era
concrete jungle blocks.

00:03:59.771 --> 00:04:01.520 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: I mean, it's
funny just thinking

00:04:01.520 --> 00:04:04.477 align:middle line:90%
about the quandary you were in.

00:04:04.477 --> 00:04:05.560 align:middle line:90%
>>PARK: Yeah, it is funny.

00:04:05.560 --> 00:04:08.190 align:middle line:84%
But, you know, it
happened for a reason,

00:04:08.190 --> 00:04:10.790 align:middle line:84%
because it took me time
to acquire the skills

00:04:10.790 --> 00:04:13.830 align:middle line:90%
and to embark upon this path.

00:04:13.830 --> 00:04:16.100 align:middle line:90%
And so it's ironic.

00:04:16.100 --> 00:04:20.110 align:middle line:84%
With the IUD thing, I was
practicing OB/GYN for 14 years.

00:04:20.110 --> 00:04:22.360 align:middle line:84%
And we were in a
situation where we

00:04:22.360 --> 00:04:26.270 align:middle line:84%
would buy these IUDs from the
only monopoly in the country.

00:04:26.270 --> 00:04:30.580 align:middle line:84%
And they cost like
$50 or $60 more

00:04:30.580 --> 00:04:33.052 align:middle line:84%
to buy than we were
reimbursed, which was fine,

00:04:33.052 --> 00:04:34.135 align:middle line:90%
because the manufacturer--

00:04:34.135 --> 00:04:36.468 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Because you were
working with low-income women

00:04:36.468 --> 00:04:37.299 align:middle line:90%
and birth control.

00:04:37.299 --> 00:04:37.840 align:middle line:90%
>>PARK: Yeah.

00:04:37.840 --> 00:04:41.110 align:middle line:84%
About a third of my practice was
really medically-indigent women

00:04:41.110 --> 00:04:43.310 align:middle line:90%
with no insurance per se.

00:04:43.310 --> 00:04:46.730 align:middle line:84%
So in order to provide that,
I figured since I had trained

00:04:46.730 --> 00:04:49.245 align:middle line:84%
as an expert in IUDs-- I'd
actually worked, ironically,

00:04:49.245 --> 00:04:50.620 align:middle line:84%
for the government
to teach women

00:04:50.620 --> 00:04:53.340 align:middle line:84%
in El Salvador for the
Agency for International

00:04:53.340 --> 00:04:55.100 align:middle line:90%
Development about IUDs.

00:04:55.100 --> 00:04:58.020 align:middle line:84%
So I knew that
these were the same.

00:04:58.020 --> 00:05:00.170 align:middle line:84%
I went down, and I sought
out a pharmacy where

00:05:00.170 --> 00:05:02.130 align:middle line:90%
I could buy a generic form.

00:05:02.130 --> 00:05:04.900 align:middle line:84%
Well, somebody at the company
that makes them in the US

00:05:04.900 --> 00:05:05.730 align:middle line:90%
didn't like that.

00:05:05.730 --> 00:05:07.950 align:middle line:84%
And so they tried to do a
sting on all these doctors.

00:05:07.950 --> 00:05:09.480 align:middle line:84%
And long story short,
I got in trouble.

00:05:09.480 --> 00:05:10.870 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: But when you found
them, it was the same--

00:05:10.870 --> 00:05:11.750 align:middle line:90%
>>PARK: Same thing.

00:05:11.750 --> 00:05:15.060 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: It's the same
product but not private-labeled

00:05:15.060 --> 00:05:16.690 align:middle line:84%
as you would find
them in the US.

00:05:16.690 --> 00:05:19.080 align:middle line:84%
>>PARK: Right, and unlike
drugs, which are actually

00:05:19.080 --> 00:05:20.810 align:middle line:84%
manufactured, this
is just a piece

00:05:20.810 --> 00:05:23.180 align:middle line:84%
of sterile plastic
wrapped with copper

00:05:23.180 --> 00:05:24.610 align:middle line:90%
and a piece of fishing wire.

00:05:24.610 --> 00:05:28.220 align:middle line:84%
It's pretty low tech,
manufactured in an FDA facility

00:05:28.220 --> 00:05:29.440 align:middle line:90%
in Mexico.

00:05:29.440 --> 00:05:32.060 align:middle line:84%
But the reason why
people don't sell them

00:05:32.060 --> 00:05:33.407 align:middle line:90%
is because, you know--

00:05:33.407 --> 00:05:34.740 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: They're a lot cheaper.

00:05:34.740 --> 00:05:35.990 align:middle line:90%
>>PARK: They're a lot cheaper.

00:05:35.990 --> 00:05:38.730 align:middle line:84%
And even in Mexico,
it's basically free.

00:05:38.730 --> 00:05:40.982 align:middle line:84%
And it's the preferred
form of birth control,

00:05:40.982 --> 00:05:43.190 align:middle line:84%
so it's a very safe and
effective non-hormonal method

00:05:43.190 --> 00:05:44.330 align:middle line:90%
of birth control.

00:05:44.330 --> 00:05:47.070 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: But this is where you
got an up-close glimpse of how

00:05:47.070 --> 00:05:48.010 align:middle line:90%
the government works.

00:05:48.010 --> 00:05:49.910 align:middle line:84%
I mean, no good deed
goes unpunished.

00:05:49.910 --> 00:05:51.340 align:middle line:90%
You were trying to help people.

00:05:51.340 --> 00:05:52.270 align:middle line:84%
>>PARK: Trying to
help people, yeah.

00:05:52.270 --> 00:05:53.790 align:middle line:84%
Probably over the
course a few years

00:05:53.790 --> 00:05:56.970 align:middle line:90%
we put in maybe 20 at most.

00:05:56.970 --> 00:06:00.120 align:middle line:84%
But this was what caused
the chain reaction, which

00:06:00.120 --> 00:06:02.540 align:middle line:84%
made me lose my ability
to practice medicine

00:06:02.540 --> 00:06:05.634 align:middle line:84%
for five years which
seems disproportionate.

00:06:05.634 --> 00:06:06.300 align:middle line:90%
But in the end--

00:06:06.300 --> 00:06:07.720 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Yeah, you
would think, especially

00:06:07.720 --> 00:06:09.344 align:middle line:84%
considering your
expertise in the area.

00:06:09.344 --> 00:06:12.820 align:middle line:84%
And then ironically, as
I recall in your book,

00:06:12.820 --> 00:06:17.800 align:middle line:84%
Canadian MDs doing the same
thing with generic IUDs

00:06:17.800 --> 00:06:18.857 align:middle line:90%
were not being slapped.

00:06:18.857 --> 00:06:19.440 align:middle line:90%
>>PARK: Right.

00:06:19.440 --> 00:06:20.150 align:middle line:90%
Right.

00:06:20.150 --> 00:06:22.240 align:middle line:84%
Apparently you could
buy a Canadian IUD

00:06:22.240 --> 00:06:25.620 align:middle line:84%
and resell it in this
country, but the US monopoly

00:06:25.620 --> 00:06:26.900 align:middle line:90%
had to be preserved.

00:06:26.900 --> 00:06:28.800 align:middle line:84%
So, you know, it's
water under the bridge.

00:06:28.800 --> 00:06:29.341 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: OK.

00:06:29.341 --> 00:06:32.200 align:middle line:84%
So now they say, OK, you
can't practice for five years.

00:06:32.200 --> 00:06:34.560 align:middle line:84%
And you really--
you chose OB/GYN

00:06:34.560 --> 00:06:36.920 align:middle line:84%
because it was a
happy experience,

00:06:36.920 --> 00:06:40.340 align:middle line:84%
and you're overly empathetic,
I understand, to suffering

00:06:40.340 --> 00:06:41.510 align:middle line:90%
to an extent, right?

00:06:41.510 --> 00:06:42.509 align:middle line:90%
>>PARK: Well, you know--

00:06:42.509 --> 00:06:43.950 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: You didn't enjoy that.

00:06:43.950 --> 00:06:45.116 align:middle line:90%
>>PARK: I think that's true.

00:06:45.116 --> 00:06:48.850 align:middle line:84%
I think OB/GYNs tend to like
the happier side of medicine.

00:06:48.850 --> 00:06:50.980 align:middle line:84%
So when people get
sick, there's a thing

00:06:50.980 --> 00:06:52.690 align:middle line:84%
called
countertransference, where

00:06:52.690 --> 00:06:54.600 align:middle line:90%
you like feel responsible.

00:06:54.600 --> 00:06:56.860 align:middle line:84%
So yeah, it's kind
of a bummer working

00:06:56.860 --> 00:06:59.900 align:middle line:84%
with conditions that are not
curable, like neurology or even

00:06:59.900 --> 00:07:00.400 align:middle line:90%
medicine.

00:07:00.400 --> 00:07:02.040 align:middle line:84%
It's more like
disease maintenance.

00:07:02.040 --> 00:07:04.110 align:middle line:84%
But I can literally
count on one hand

00:07:04.110 --> 00:07:06.180 align:middle line:84%
the number of things in
14 years that I thought

00:07:06.180 --> 00:07:09.260 align:middle line:84%
were not great or
somewhat maybe could

00:07:09.260 --> 00:07:10.919 align:middle line:90%
have been improved on my part.

00:07:10.919 --> 00:07:12.210 align:middle line:90%
So there's not a lot of regret.

00:07:12.210 --> 00:07:15.360 align:middle line:84%
You help people with
problems that are solvable.

00:07:15.360 --> 00:07:17.279 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: You usher new
life into the world.

00:07:17.279 --> 00:07:17.820 align:middle line:90%
>>PARK: Yeah.

00:07:17.820 --> 00:07:20.540 align:middle line:84%
You attend births, which
what's more fun than that?

00:07:20.540 --> 00:07:23.800 align:middle line:84%
So it was actually a good
segue into anti-aging,

00:07:23.800 --> 00:07:24.455 align:middle line:90%
because again--

00:07:24.455 --> 00:07:25.038 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:07:25.038 --> 00:07:27.082 align:middle line:84%
You're starting at the
beginning of the process.

00:07:27.082 --> 00:07:30.490 align:middle line:84%
>>PARK: I attend re-births
now, as I like to say.

00:07:30.490 --> 00:07:31.620 align:middle line:90%
And it's all good.

00:07:31.620 --> 00:07:33.040 align:middle line:90%
I like to help people.

00:07:33.040 --> 00:07:34.710 align:middle line:84%
And part of the
frustration of medicine,

00:07:34.710 --> 00:07:37.760 align:middle line:84%
you go in it to help
people, and so much of it

00:07:37.760 --> 00:07:40.409 align:middle line:84%
is the inculcation of
hopelessness, right?

00:07:40.409 --> 00:07:41.075 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:07:41.075 --> 00:07:42.870 align:middle line:84%
>>PARK: So our
religion, as it were,

00:07:42.870 --> 00:07:45.640 align:middle line:84%
is that there is no cure
for getting old and dying,

00:07:45.640 --> 00:07:48.040 align:middle line:84%
and you're just there
to administer the latest

00:07:48.040 --> 00:07:49.800 align:middle line:90%
technology, right?

00:07:49.800 --> 00:07:51.930 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: To squash
symptoms for a short time.

00:07:51.930 --> 00:07:53.750 align:middle line:84%
>>PARK: Or even beget
new ones that can

00:07:53.750 --> 00:07:55.974 align:middle line:90%
be treated with the next drug.

00:07:55.974 --> 00:07:56.640 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:07:56.640 --> 00:07:58.700 align:middle line:84%
Well, that is the
other side of it.

00:07:58.700 --> 00:07:59.570 align:middle line:90%
Absolutely.

00:07:59.570 --> 00:08:03.040 align:middle line:84%
So once you lost your license
for that period of time,

00:08:03.040 --> 00:08:05.880 align:middle line:84%
did that give you an opportunity
to express yourself and start

00:08:05.880 --> 00:08:07.991 align:middle line:84%
studying in new ways,
going down new channels?

00:08:07.991 --> 00:08:08.532 align:middle line:90%
>>PARK: Yeah.

00:08:08.532 --> 00:08:10.198 align:middle line:84%
Well, I didn't actually
lose my license.

00:08:10.198 --> 00:08:13.530 align:middle line:84%
And we made a plea bargain
which was retracted.

00:08:13.530 --> 00:08:15.987 align:middle line:84%
So actually my record, my
license is totally clean.

00:08:15.987 --> 00:08:17.070 align:middle line:90%
I could practice medicine.

00:08:17.070 --> 00:08:19.779 align:middle line:84%
But I can't bill for
Medicaid or Medicare.

00:08:19.779 --> 00:08:20.320 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: OK.

00:08:20.320 --> 00:08:22.131 align:middle line:84%
So it didn't work on
a governmental level.

00:08:22.131 --> 00:08:22.630 align:middle line:90%
Gotcha.

00:08:22.630 --> 00:08:23.030 align:middle line:90%
>>PARK: Right.

00:08:23.030 --> 00:08:23.153 align:middle line:90%
No.

00:08:23.153 --> 00:08:24.986 align:middle line:84%
It's ironic, which just
shows you the irony.

00:08:24.986 --> 00:08:28.990 align:middle line:84%
You can actually treat all
Medicare and Medicaid patients,

00:08:28.990 --> 00:08:30.480 align:middle line:90%
but you're not allowed to bill.

00:08:30.480 --> 00:08:31.150 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: You can't
bill the government.

00:08:31.150 --> 00:08:32.080 align:middle line:84%
>>PARK: Yeah, which
is pretty much

00:08:32.080 --> 00:08:33.349 align:middle line:90%
where they're going anyway.

00:08:33.349 --> 00:08:33.650 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: OK.

00:08:33.650 --> 00:08:34.150 align:middle line:90%
All right.

00:08:34.150 --> 00:08:36.650 align:middle line:84%
So now how did you
get from the happy job

00:08:36.650 --> 00:08:38.870 align:middle line:84%
of ushering new life
into the world, then

00:08:38.870 --> 00:08:40.659 align:middle line:90%
into the telomere research.

00:08:40.659 --> 00:08:43.957 align:middle line:84%
And when you first discovered
it, I know you embraced it.

00:08:43.957 --> 00:08:46.040 align:middle line:84%
You were one of the first
people in the world that

00:08:46.040 --> 00:08:48.630 align:middle line:84%
started taking the
telomerase activator.

00:08:48.630 --> 00:08:50.620 align:middle line:84%
So let's talk about
how that happened.

00:08:50.620 --> 00:08:52.910 align:middle line:84%
>>PARK: Well, like I
said, so my dad was sick,

00:08:52.910 --> 00:08:54.020 align:middle line:90%
battling brain cancer.

00:08:54.020 --> 00:08:57.640 align:middle line:84%
And so I thought, this is the
theory that makes sense to me.

00:08:57.640 --> 00:08:59.500 align:middle line:84%
And so I wrote
the graphic novel.

00:08:59.500 --> 00:09:01.307 align:middle line:84%
And then the next
year a company said,

00:09:01.307 --> 00:09:03.890 align:middle line:84%
we have a telomerase activator,
which is something I imagined.

00:09:03.890 --> 00:09:05.480 align:middle line:84%
And all of a sudden,
you could try it.

00:09:05.480 --> 00:09:08.584 align:middle line:84%
So I didn't let people
know, but I tried it.

00:09:08.584 --> 00:09:10.250 align:middle line:84%
I was like the 19th
person in the world.

00:09:10.250 --> 00:09:11.750 align:middle line:84%
At that time, it
was very expensive.

00:09:11.750 --> 00:09:15.632 align:middle line:84%
It was close to
$30,000 to take it.

00:09:15.632 --> 00:09:17.840 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Were you taking
super high dosages compared

00:09:17.840 --> 00:09:18.660 align:middle line:90%
to what's available now?

00:09:18.660 --> 00:09:18.730 align:middle line:90%
>>PARK: No.

00:09:18.730 --> 00:09:19.271 align:middle line:90%
Actually, no.

00:09:19.271 --> 00:09:19.830 align:middle line:90%
Quite low.

00:09:19.830 --> 00:09:22.189 align:middle line:84%
But they ramped it up very
quickly because it was safe.

00:09:22.189 --> 00:09:23.230 align:middle line:90%
They weren't really sure.

00:09:23.230 --> 00:09:24.120 align:middle line:90%
It's very kind of--

00:09:24.120 --> 00:09:24.745 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:09:24.745 --> 00:09:26.580 align:middle line:84%
You didn't know what
was going to happen.

00:09:26.580 --> 00:09:28.704 align:middle line:90%
This is your cellular integrity.

00:09:28.704 --> 00:09:29.245 align:middle line:90%
>>PARK: Yeah.

00:09:29.245 --> 00:09:32.110 align:middle line:84%
And I applaud the company
for being conservative.

00:09:32.110 --> 00:09:34.420 align:middle line:84%
But the initial consent
was really funny.

00:09:34.420 --> 00:09:37.350 align:middle line:84%
It was like, oh, if you take
this you're going to get cancer

00:09:37.350 --> 00:09:39.440 align:middle line:84%
and all your kids
in all generations

00:09:39.440 --> 00:09:40.920 align:middle line:90%
will be stricken with plague.

00:09:40.920 --> 00:09:41.350 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Degraded.

00:09:41.350 --> 00:09:41.891 align:middle line:90%
>>PARK: Yeah.

00:09:41.891 --> 00:09:45.240 align:middle line:84%
It was just totally-- it
was just completely crazy.

00:09:45.240 --> 00:09:46.000 align:middle line:90%
But--

00:09:46.000 --> 00:09:47.465 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: That was what
the disclaimer said?

00:09:47.465 --> 00:09:47.687 align:middle line:90%
>>PARK: Yeah.

00:09:47.687 --> 00:09:48.187 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:09:48.187 --> 00:09:52.420 align:middle line:84%
But for some reason, about 100
eccentrics, Tony Stark X-Men

00:09:52.420 --> 00:09:54.930 align:middle line:84%
would-be, ponied
up and tried it.

00:09:54.930 --> 00:09:57.590 align:middle line:84%
But the exciting thing
was within three months,

00:09:57.590 --> 00:10:00.460 align:middle line:84%
I had lost like 20 pounds
without diet or exercise.

00:10:00.460 --> 00:10:02.700 align:middle line:84%
So all my patients came
back for their pap smears,

00:10:02.700 --> 00:10:05.630 align:middle line:84%
for their annuals,
"what happened?"

00:10:05.630 --> 00:10:07.004 align:middle line:90%
Transformation.

00:10:07.004 --> 00:10:09.170 align:middle line:84%
And so I didn't really tell
people what was going on

00:10:09.170 --> 00:10:10.590 align:middle line:90%
until about a year.

00:10:10.590 --> 00:10:12.962 align:middle line:84%
And then I said, well,
I'm taking this thing--

00:10:12.962 --> 00:10:14.170 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Experimental thing.

00:10:14.170 --> 00:10:14.560 align:middle line:90%
>>PARK: Right.

00:10:14.560 --> 00:10:15.976 align:middle line:84%
And they said,
well, give us some.

00:10:15.976 --> 00:10:17.100 align:middle line:90%
We want some.

00:10:17.100 --> 00:10:20.740 align:middle line:84%
So I asked the company whether
I could be a provider of this.

00:10:20.740 --> 00:10:23.480 align:middle line:84%
And they allowed me
to be the first doctor

00:10:23.480 --> 00:10:25.670 align:middle line:84%
outside the company
to prescribe it.

00:10:25.670 --> 00:10:27.695 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And the
company is Geron?

00:10:27.695 --> 00:10:29.040 align:middle line:90%
Was it a different one?

00:10:29.040 --> 00:10:30.430 align:middle line:84%
>>PARK: No, it's a company
called TA Sciences.

00:10:30.430 --> 00:10:30.971 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: OK.

00:10:30.971 --> 00:10:31.480 align:middle line:90%
TA Sciences.

00:10:31.480 --> 00:10:33.313 align:middle line:84%
>>PARK: And so they had
sublicensed and then

00:10:33.313 --> 00:10:35.640 align:middle line:84%
subsequently acquired
the intellectual property

00:10:35.640 --> 00:10:36.520 align:middle line:90%
from Geron.

00:10:36.520 --> 00:10:38.140 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: I see.

00:10:38.140 --> 00:10:38.640 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:10:38.640 --> 00:10:41.930 align:middle line:84%
So now at what
point did you start

00:10:41.930 --> 00:10:45.300 align:middle line:84%
allowing your patients
to kind of imbibe

00:10:45.300 --> 00:10:47.720 align:middle line:90%
with you, alongside you?

00:10:47.720 --> 00:10:49.700 align:middle line:84%
Did you feel comfortable
enough at this point

00:10:49.700 --> 00:10:52.330 align:middle line:84%
there were no side effects
that the average person could

00:10:52.330 --> 00:10:53.390 align:middle line:90%
start taking it?

00:10:53.390 --> 00:10:55.580 align:middle line:84%
>>PARK: Well, even before
taking it, I made sure,

00:10:55.580 --> 00:10:59.510 align:middle line:84%
I looked at all the safety,
the efficacy, the toxicity,

00:10:59.510 --> 00:11:00.870 align:middle line:90%
totally safe in my mind.

00:11:00.870 --> 00:11:05.560 align:middle line:84%
So after about a year,
people would contact me,

00:11:05.560 --> 00:11:08.780 align:middle line:84%
because there really was
nobody offering this locally.

00:11:08.780 --> 00:11:12.072 align:middle line:84%
So we acquired all the
machinery to test people.

00:11:12.072 --> 00:11:13.530 align:middle line:84%
We have really
interesting machines

00:11:13.530 --> 00:11:17.160 align:middle line:84%
to test the age of the lungs,
the heart, the skin, the brain.

00:11:17.160 --> 00:11:18.624 align:middle line:90%
And so we embarked upon this.

00:11:18.624 --> 00:11:19.540 align:middle line:90%
But it's a tough sell.

00:11:19.540 --> 00:11:22.160 align:middle line:84%
I mean, the first year or
two, before the Nobel Prize

00:11:22.160 --> 00:11:25.115 align:middle line:84%
for telomerase, nobody-- the
only people that came out

00:11:25.115 --> 00:11:28.232 align:middle line:84%
of the woodwork were kind
of eccentric, wonderful--

00:11:28.232 --> 00:11:29.440 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Wealthy eccentrics.

00:11:29.440 --> 00:11:30.106 align:middle line:90%
>>PARK: Wealthy.

00:11:30.106 --> 00:11:34.620 align:middle line:84%
Engineers, CEOs-- because that's
the skill set that you need.

00:11:34.620 --> 00:11:38.580 align:middle line:84%
A CEO can change the course
of the ship on their judgment.

00:11:38.580 --> 00:11:41.920 align:middle line:84%
And engineers don't get
wrapped up in the "what if,"

00:11:41.920 --> 00:11:44.070 align:middle line:84%
so they're just very
mechanistic, which

00:11:44.070 --> 00:11:47.450 align:middle line:84%
is the thing that differentiates
this sort of thing

00:11:47.450 --> 00:11:49.470 align:middle line:84%
from everything else
because you don't

00:11:49.470 --> 00:11:52.470 align:middle line:84%
have to have a huge leap of
faith to believe in this.

00:11:52.470 --> 00:11:54.040 align:middle line:84%
It just follows
one from the next.

00:11:54.040 --> 00:11:56.372 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Well, the
Nobel Prize didn't hurt.

00:11:56.372 --> 00:11:57.830 align:middle line:84%
>>PARK: That was
a big breakthrough

00:11:57.830 --> 00:12:00.401 align:middle line:84%
because if you talk to
somebody about telomerase,

00:12:00.401 --> 00:12:01.900 align:middle line:84%
and if they're not
prepared, they're

00:12:01.900 --> 00:12:03.550 align:middle line:84%
like, oh, this sounds
like resveratrol

00:12:03.550 --> 00:12:06.640 align:middle line:90%
or CoQ10 or everything else.

00:12:06.640 --> 00:12:10.210 align:middle line:84%
But when you say the Nobel
Prize committee has recognized

00:12:10.210 --> 00:12:12.680 align:middle line:84%
that this is fundamental
to all life on earth,

00:12:12.680 --> 00:12:13.930 align:middle line:90%
people are like, oh, OK.

00:12:13.930 --> 00:12:16.989 align:middle line:84%
Maybe this isn't
like everything else.

00:12:16.989 --> 00:12:17.530 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: OK.

00:12:17.530 --> 00:12:22.090 align:middle line:84%
So at that point, when you
first started selling it

00:12:22.090 --> 00:12:24.660 align:middle line:84%
as a doctor to
your clients, what

00:12:24.660 --> 00:12:27.370 align:middle line:84%
was the price point on it at
that point, just to get a feel?

00:12:27.370 --> 00:12:30.980 align:middle line:84%
Like you said, initially it was
expensive, CEOs, eccentrics,

00:12:30.980 --> 00:12:31.910 align:middle line:90%
engineers.

00:12:31.910 --> 00:12:36.330 align:middle line:84%
So what were they having to
lay down a month to do this?

00:12:36.330 --> 00:12:39.350 align:middle line:84%
>>PARK: Anywhere from
like $200 to $900 a month.

00:12:39.350 --> 00:12:41.339 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So it
really was just for--

00:12:41.339 --> 00:12:41.880 align:middle line:90%
>>PARK: Yeah.

00:12:41.880 --> 00:12:42.560 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:12:42.560 --> 00:12:44.400 align:middle line:90%
Not for the average person.

00:12:44.400 --> 00:12:46.720 align:middle line:84%
Now, that's changed
considerably since then.

00:12:46.720 --> 00:12:47.530 align:middle line:84%
>>PARK: Well, you know,
it kind of depends on

00:12:47.530 --> 00:12:48.890 align:middle line:90%
how you value things.

00:12:48.890 --> 00:12:53.060 align:middle line:84%
Some people who really
want to believe,

00:12:53.060 --> 00:12:56.240 align:middle line:84%
even if it's a struggle for
them, just to see if it works,

00:12:56.240 --> 00:12:59.160 align:middle line:84%
we had plenty of people who
were not wealthy try it.

00:12:59.160 --> 00:13:02.050 align:middle line:84%
So it's always kind of
like an ongoing dialectic

00:13:02.050 --> 00:13:05.660 align:middle line:84%
between the value and the
attribution of the effects.

00:13:05.660 --> 00:13:09.320 align:middle line:84%
But most people who
try it do feel it.

00:13:09.320 --> 00:13:11.220 align:middle line:84%
And then they have to
wonder, is it worth it?

00:13:11.220 --> 00:13:15.680 align:middle line:84%
But if I were to say you,
you could drive a worse car

00:13:15.680 --> 00:13:19.390 align:middle line:84%
but then regain 20 years of
genetic endowment in life,

00:13:19.390 --> 00:13:21.027 align:middle line:84%
most people would
take that trade.

00:13:21.027 --> 00:13:21.610 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:13:21.610 --> 00:13:22.110 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:13:22.110 --> 00:13:23.665 align:middle line:84%
And so now you
yourself, because you

00:13:23.665 --> 00:13:26.080 align:middle line:84%
were in the very early
stage when it was very, very

00:13:26.080 --> 00:13:29.430 align:middle line:84%
expensive, you had made some
money on an investment--

00:13:29.430 --> 00:13:30.670 align:middle line:90%
and I love it.

00:13:30.670 --> 00:13:33.240 align:middle line:84%
There's a really quirky part
of you that I really like.

00:13:33.240 --> 00:13:33.680 align:middle line:90%
>>PARK: Thank you.

00:13:33.680 --> 00:13:35.096 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: I mean,
you look normal.

00:13:35.096 --> 00:13:40.060 align:middle line:84%
But you have an irreverence
about you and you go out

00:13:40.060 --> 00:13:42.680 align:middle line:84%
and you do things and
take chances in life.

00:13:42.680 --> 00:13:43.750 align:middle line:90%
And you're very creative.

00:13:43.750 --> 00:13:46.120 align:middle line:84%
But one of the
things you did is you

00:13:46.120 --> 00:13:49.599 align:middle line:84%
invested in Crocs, those funny
little orange and purple shoes.

00:13:49.599 --> 00:13:51.640 align:middle line:84%
>>PARK: Yeah, which is
out of Colorado, isn't it?

00:13:51.640 --> 00:13:52.080 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:13:52.080 --> 00:13:53.871 align:middle line:84%
>>PARK: Well, you know,
it's a funny story.

00:13:53.871 --> 00:13:57.460 align:middle line:84%
I had traded options, you know,
and made money doing that.

00:13:57.460 --> 00:14:02.830 align:middle line:84%
But at some point because
Crocs are so ugly, right,

00:14:02.830 --> 00:14:08.460 align:middle line:84%
aesthetically, there are a bunch
of very I'm sure knowledgeable

00:14:08.460 --> 00:14:10.390 align:middle line:90%
but--

00:14:10.390 --> 00:14:12.530 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Not
aesthetically well endowed.

00:14:12.530 --> 00:14:13.780 align:middle line:84%
>>PARK: People acted
out of emotion, right?

00:14:13.780 --> 00:14:14.115 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes, exactly.

00:14:14.115 --> 00:14:15.616 align:middle line:84%
>>PARK: So traders
would say there's

00:14:15.616 --> 00:14:17.823 align:middle line:84%
no way this company would
go up and up every quarter.

00:14:17.823 --> 00:14:19.050 align:middle line:90%
And yet they kept on beating.

00:14:19.050 --> 00:14:20.424 align:middle line:84%
And so there were
a lot of people

00:14:20.424 --> 00:14:23.790 align:middle line:84%
who took contrary positions,
so that allowed my options

00:14:23.790 --> 00:14:25.715 align:middle line:90%
to go crazy high.

00:14:25.715 --> 00:14:27.340 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So you made
a bunch of money.

00:14:27.340 --> 00:14:28.370 align:middle line:90%
>>PARK: Crazy money.

00:14:28.370 --> 00:14:29.340 align:middle line:90%
Easy come, easy go.

00:14:29.340 --> 00:14:31.710 align:middle line:84%
But I mean, I know
how to trade options,

00:14:31.710 --> 00:14:32.730 align:middle line:90%
all kinds of strategies.

00:14:32.730 --> 00:14:35.230 align:middle line:84%
But that was just dumb luck, I
mean being at the right place

00:14:35.230 --> 00:14:35.460 align:middle line:90%
at the right time.

00:14:35.460 --> 00:14:36.720 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So it gave
you the money, though,

00:14:36.720 --> 00:14:39.157 align:middle line:84%
to be able to really invest
yourself into the telomerase.

00:14:39.157 --> 00:14:39.740 align:middle line:90%
>>PARK: Right.

00:14:39.740 --> 00:14:40.240 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:14:40.240 --> 00:14:43.290 align:middle line:84%
I wouldn't have been able
to afford $30,000 a year

00:14:43.290 --> 00:14:45.260 align:middle line:90%
on a doctor's salary.

00:14:45.260 --> 00:14:46.040 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: No.

00:14:46.040 --> 00:14:46.580 align:middle line:90%
>>PARK: No.

00:14:46.580 --> 00:14:47.121 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: OK.

00:14:47.121 --> 00:14:49.727 align:middle line:84%
So over the course of,
let's say, let's go ahead

00:14:49.727 --> 00:14:51.810 align:middle line:84%
and take it just a little
further out than a year,

00:14:51.810 --> 00:14:53.730 align:middle line:84%
two years, three years
and some of the effects

00:14:53.730 --> 00:14:55.010 align:middle line:84%
you were noticing in
you and your clients.

00:14:55.010 --> 00:14:56.820 align:middle line:84%
And then we're going
to start diving

00:14:56.820 --> 00:14:58.240 align:middle line:90%
into more of the science.

00:14:58.240 --> 00:14:59.820 align:middle line:90%
>>PARK: Sure.

00:14:59.820 --> 00:15:04.600 align:middle line:84%
So for me, it just
was status quo.

00:15:04.600 --> 00:15:07.300 align:middle line:84%
Once it cleared out
the bad fat stem cells,

00:15:07.300 --> 00:15:10.550 align:middle line:84%
I found it very
difficult to gain weight.

00:15:10.550 --> 00:15:12.270 align:middle line:90%
And so it just felt fine.

00:15:12.270 --> 00:15:15.980 align:middle line:84%
My telomeres got shorter
initially, then longer.

00:15:15.980 --> 00:15:17.620 align:middle line:84%
So I just believe
it's an adaptogen.

00:15:17.620 --> 00:15:20.011 align:middle line:84%
It just helps your
body maintain.

00:15:20.011 --> 00:15:21.260 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: That's a good point.

00:15:21.260 --> 00:15:22.790 align:middle line:84%
I didn't write that
down, but I wanted

00:15:22.790 --> 00:15:24.706 align:middle line:84%
to ask you if it might
be a type of adaptogen.

00:15:24.706 --> 00:15:26.470 align:middle line:84%
>>PARK: Oh, the
ultimate, I think, yeah.

00:15:26.470 --> 00:15:26.790 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Really?

00:15:26.790 --> 00:15:28.998 align:middle line:84%
>>PARK: So we really don't
know exactly how it works.

00:15:28.998 --> 00:15:31.490 align:middle line:84%
I mean, you can look at the
genes that it activates.

00:15:31.490 --> 00:15:35.100 align:middle line:84%
And a lot of them have
to do with cell division,

00:15:35.100 --> 00:15:37.250 align:middle line:90%
and it's very benign.

00:15:37.250 --> 00:15:39.580 align:middle line:90%
It's very limited effect.

00:15:39.580 --> 00:15:42.720 align:middle line:84%
But it's a mystery, as is
everything, how things work,

00:15:42.720 --> 00:15:44.570 align:middle line:90%
why they work.

00:15:44.570 --> 00:15:46.650 align:middle line:90%
But--

00:15:46.650 --> 00:15:47.890 align:middle line:90%
So I would acquire patients.

00:15:47.890 --> 00:15:51.550 align:middle line:84%
I have well over probably 1,300
patients who have tried it now.

00:15:51.550 --> 00:15:54.320 align:middle line:84%
But people would try it and
they'd call me and say, doc,

00:15:54.320 --> 00:15:56.850 align:middle line:84%
have you ever noticed people
getting better with regard

00:15:56.850 --> 00:16:02.349 align:middle line:84%
to depression or blood pressure
or diabetes or what have you?

00:16:02.349 --> 00:16:04.390 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: That would
indicate it is an adaptogen,

00:16:04.390 --> 00:16:07.250 align:middle line:84%
because it was kind of every
symptom and condition was

00:16:07.250 --> 00:16:07.940 align:middle line:90%
being--

00:16:07.940 --> 00:16:10.040 align:middle line:84%
>>PARK: Exactly, which,
you know, FDA-wise,

00:16:10.040 --> 00:16:12.930 align:middle line:84%
we don't get into
making claims like that.

00:16:12.930 --> 00:16:15.550 align:middle line:84%
But as you know, an
adaptogen is something

00:16:15.550 --> 00:16:18.350 align:middle line:84%
that just helps the
body restore balance

00:16:18.350 --> 00:16:19.690 align:middle line:90%
by some mysterious process.

00:16:19.690 --> 00:16:23.450 align:middle line:84%
And so it's really in the
realm of pseudoscience.

00:16:23.450 --> 00:16:25.610 align:middle line:84%
And yet, just because
we don't understand it,

00:16:25.610 --> 00:16:27.850 align:middle line:84%
doesn't mean there aren't
proximate pathways that

00:16:27.850 --> 00:16:29.739 align:middle line:90%
can be elucidated.

00:16:29.739 --> 00:16:32.280 align:middle line:84%
But people would call me and
I'd say, oh, that's interesting.

00:16:32.280 --> 00:16:35.490 align:middle line:84%
But I have to take it
with a grain of salt also.

00:16:35.490 --> 00:16:38.502 align:middle line:84%
A lot of it is placebo, which
is not fake, by the way.

00:16:38.502 --> 00:16:39.210 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: No, no.

00:16:39.210 --> 00:16:40.940 align:middle line:84%
There's a lot of
power in placebo.

00:16:40.940 --> 00:16:42.700 align:middle line:84%
That's kind of the
holy grail in a sense.

00:16:42.700 --> 00:16:43.480 align:middle line:90%
>>PARK: That's interesting.

00:16:43.480 --> 00:16:43.810 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:16:43.810 --> 00:16:45.060 align:middle line:90%
We need to get back into that.

00:16:45.060 --> 00:16:47.520 align:middle line:84%
But panacea also is
a derogatory term

00:16:47.520 --> 00:16:52.110 align:middle line:84%
because people think that a
panacea is by nature false.

00:16:52.110 --> 00:16:53.946 align:middle line:84%
But you know I would
kind of file it away.

00:16:53.946 --> 00:16:55.570 align:middle line:84%
And when two or three
people called me,

00:16:55.570 --> 00:16:57.110 align:middle line:84%
I would do a
webinar just to see.

00:16:57.110 --> 00:16:59.310 align:middle line:84%
So we would go over
the basic science

00:16:59.310 --> 00:17:00.927 align:middle line:90%
of you name the disease.

00:17:00.927 --> 00:17:02.510 align:middle line:84%
There's like 47 of
these now that I've

00:17:02.510 --> 00:17:04.710 align:middle line:84%
done on different
topics, from MS

00:17:04.710 --> 00:17:06.660 align:middle line:90%
to Parkinson's, sports injury.

00:17:06.660 --> 00:17:08.410 align:middle line:84%
And then we talk about
what the literature

00:17:08.410 --> 00:17:10.560 align:middle line:84%
with regard to telomeres
and stem cells would be.

00:17:10.560 --> 00:17:15.109 align:middle line:84%
And then we'd interview that
person and vet them out.

00:17:15.109 --> 00:17:17.450 align:middle line:84%
And I think a lot of
people resonated with those

00:17:17.450 --> 00:17:21.579 align:middle line:84%
because you can listen to
an expert or read a book,

00:17:21.579 --> 00:17:23.349 align:middle line:84%
but when you really
listen to a person

00:17:23.349 --> 00:17:26.210 align:middle line:84%
talk about their experience,
then you can really

00:17:26.210 --> 00:17:28.390 align:middle line:84%
kind of intuit whether
they're sincere

00:17:28.390 --> 00:17:30.069 align:middle line:90%
and whether it really happened.

00:17:30.069 --> 00:17:32.360 align:middle line:84%
And so that really motivated
a lot of people to try it.

00:17:32.360 --> 00:17:33.359 align:middle line:90%
And those are out there.

00:17:33.359 --> 00:17:36.200 align:middle line:84%
They've gotten over
200,000 views now.

00:17:36.200 --> 00:17:40.570 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And I
know that you say

00:17:40.570 --> 00:17:43.280 align:middle line:84%
it works better if you
start taking in your 20s,

00:17:43.280 --> 00:17:48.760 align:middle line:84%
before the kind of DNA damage,
chromosomal damage occurs.

00:17:48.760 --> 00:17:52.370 align:middle line:84%
But you actually have worked
with someone as old as-- what,

00:17:52.370 --> 00:17:54.470 align:middle line:90%
how old was she, 110, 111, 112?

00:17:54.470 --> 00:17:55.659 align:middle line:90%
>>PARK: Yeah, 112.

00:17:55.659 --> 00:17:57.700 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Can you tell us
a bit-- that's extreme.

00:17:57.700 --> 00:18:00.999 align:middle line:84%
But can you tell us a
little bit about her case?

00:18:00.999 --> 00:18:01.540 align:middle line:90%
>>PARK: Sure.

00:18:01.540 --> 00:18:05.120 align:middle line:84%
At the time, she was the oldest
woman in California, Soledad,

00:18:05.120 --> 00:18:07.380 align:middle line:90%
and she was 112.

00:18:07.380 --> 00:18:09.340 align:middle line:84%
And I knew her
through Steve Coles,

00:18:09.340 --> 00:18:13.130 align:middle line:84%
who's the world expert
on supercentenarians,

00:18:13.130 --> 00:18:15.380 align:middle line:84%
people over 110,
which is a whole

00:18:15.380 --> 00:18:17.700 align:middle line:90%
'nother very interesting topic.

00:18:17.700 --> 00:18:21.230 align:middle line:84%
So I met them, and I
got close to the family.

00:18:21.230 --> 00:18:24.430 align:middle line:84%
And they were willing to try
it, so we went and tested her.

00:18:24.430 --> 00:18:26.442 align:middle line:84%
The interesting thing
that happened with her

00:18:26.442 --> 00:18:27.650 align:middle line:90%
happens with a lot of people.

00:18:27.650 --> 00:18:30.870 align:middle line:84%
When she started taking it,
her sleep quality changed.

00:18:30.870 --> 00:18:32.819 align:middle line:84%
She became very
vociferous at night

00:18:32.819 --> 00:18:34.610 align:middle line:84%
and was bothering her
roommate, because she

00:18:34.610 --> 00:18:36.780 align:middle line:90%
was having active dreaming.

00:18:36.780 --> 00:18:38.600 align:middle line:90%
She was a really amazing lady.

00:18:38.600 --> 00:18:39.830 align:middle line:90%
She passed after two years.

00:18:39.830 --> 00:18:42.970 align:middle line:84%
She only took it for
a very short time.

00:18:42.970 --> 00:18:45.130 align:middle line:84%
Her doctor really was
very resistant to her

00:18:45.130 --> 00:18:48.420 align:middle line:84%
being on anything
which was unfortunate.

00:18:48.420 --> 00:18:50.390 align:middle line:84%
But the one interesting
transformation

00:18:50.390 --> 00:18:52.790 align:middle line:84%
which people are impressed
by, I guess it's impressive,

00:18:52.790 --> 00:18:57.420 align:middle line:84%
is that she sprouted
hundreds of jet black hairs.

00:18:57.420 --> 00:19:00.920 align:middle line:90%
So that was interesting.

00:19:00.920 --> 00:19:05.374 align:middle line:84%
And they persisted until
her death two years later.

00:19:05.374 --> 00:19:06.290 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Interesting.

00:19:06.290 --> 00:19:07.998 align:middle line:84%
>>PARK: I mean, she
hadn't had black hair

00:19:07.998 --> 00:19:10.880 align:middle line:84%
since the Truman administration
probably, or maybe Johnson.

00:19:10.880 --> 00:19:12.559 align:middle line:90%
But it was a while.

00:19:12.559 --> 00:19:13.100 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: OK.

00:19:13.100 --> 00:19:15.230 align:middle line:84%
So now let's start
getting into the science

00:19:15.230 --> 00:19:16.938 align:middle line:84%
itself that intrigued
you and that you've

00:19:16.938 --> 00:19:19.939 align:middle line:84%
done a lot of research
on, which is why we age.

00:19:19.939 --> 00:19:20.480 align:middle line:90%
>>PARK: Yeah.

00:19:20.480 --> 00:19:23.470 align:middle line:84%
Well, going back to just the guy
on the internet late at night,

00:19:23.470 --> 00:19:25.450 align:middle line:84%
you've got these
theories like you

00:19:25.450 --> 00:19:28.935 align:middle line:84%
get old because you don't use
stuff, which is kind of silly.

00:19:28.935 --> 00:19:29.560 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:19:29.560 --> 00:19:30.690 align:middle line:90%
We have a few-- OK.

00:19:30.690 --> 00:19:31.220 align:middle line:84%
Let's talk, let's
get into those.

00:19:31.220 --> 00:19:32.140 align:middle line:84%
>>PARK: Let's call
them out, one by one.

00:19:32.140 --> 00:19:32.681 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: OK.

00:19:32.681 --> 00:19:34.240 align:middle line:84%
We'll call them
out, one at a time.

00:19:34.240 --> 00:19:36.670 align:middle line:84%
The activity and continuity
theory-- because these

00:19:36.670 --> 00:19:39.399 align:middle line:84%
are all recognizable theories
to each one of us watching this.

00:19:39.399 --> 00:19:39.940 align:middle line:90%
>>PARK: Yeah.

00:19:39.940 --> 00:19:41.690 align:middle line:84%
I mean, google it,
"why do people age?"

00:19:41.690 --> 00:19:43.990 align:middle line:84%
And so this is kind
of really silly.

00:19:43.990 --> 00:19:47.210 align:middle line:84%
It says that people get old
because they don't do as much.

00:19:47.210 --> 00:19:49.280 align:middle line:84%
But we know plenty of
people who are volunteering

00:19:49.280 --> 00:19:52.670 align:middle line:84%
at the senior center,
teaching, volunteer this, that,

00:19:52.670 --> 00:19:53.740 align:middle line:90%
and they're learning.

00:19:53.740 --> 00:19:56.825 align:middle line:84%
And yet the body and
the mind degenerates.

00:19:56.825 --> 00:19:58.200 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And
conversely, we know

00:19:58.200 --> 00:20:00.580 align:middle line:84%
people who stay home,
have a couple bourbons,

00:20:00.580 --> 00:20:04.780 align:middle line:84%
smoke a cigarette, and enjoy
life and have no real activity,

00:20:04.780 --> 00:20:06.086 align:middle line:90%
and they live to be like 105.

00:20:06.086 --> 00:20:06.669 align:middle line:90%
>>PARK: Right.

00:20:06.669 --> 00:20:07.690 align:middle line:90%
Exactly.

00:20:07.690 --> 00:20:11.340 align:middle line:84%
Which is really-- I mean, the
things that we need attribute

00:20:11.340 --> 00:20:14.300 align:middle line:84%
to a virtuous,
healthy lifestyle,

00:20:14.300 --> 00:20:17.134 align:middle line:84%
they're just kind of
in that whole mix.

00:20:17.134 --> 00:20:19.550 align:middle line:84%
But at the end of it, there
is something in the background

00:20:19.550 --> 00:20:21.020 align:middle line:90%
fundamentally that's going on.

00:20:21.020 --> 00:20:23.285 align:middle line:84%
So that theory kind of
didn't make sense to me.

00:20:23.285 --> 00:20:26.645 align:middle line:84%
If that were true, then old
people who are super active

00:20:26.645 --> 00:20:28.630 align:middle line:90%
and gregarious wouldn't get old.

00:20:28.630 --> 00:20:29.500 align:middle line:90%
But they do.

00:20:29.500 --> 00:20:30.250 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: They do.

00:20:30.250 --> 00:20:30.749 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:20:30.749 --> 00:20:34.820 align:middle line:84%
What about the
accumulative waste theory?

00:20:34.820 --> 00:20:36.460 align:middle line:84%
>>PARK: Again, an
interesting theory

00:20:36.460 --> 00:20:38.610 align:middle line:90%
and has some truth to it.

00:20:38.610 --> 00:20:40.680 align:middle line:84%
But it says that
cells as they get

00:20:40.680 --> 00:20:45.590 align:middle line:84%
old because they're observed
to acquire bags of garbage

00:20:45.590 --> 00:20:48.780 align:middle line:84%
in them, that this
is the cause of it

00:20:48.780 --> 00:20:51.830 align:middle line:84%
and not the result of poor
cellular function in aging.

00:20:51.830 --> 00:20:54.110 align:middle line:84%
So you get things
like lipofuscin

00:20:54.110 --> 00:20:56.365 align:middle line:84%
or just accumulated waste
products in the cells.

00:20:56.365 --> 00:20:58.140 align:middle line:90%
So people say, aha.

00:20:58.140 --> 00:21:00.330 align:middle line:84%
The reason why the
cells are damaged

00:21:00.330 --> 00:21:02.210 align:middle line:84%
is because they can't
get rid of their waste.

00:21:02.210 --> 00:21:04.360 align:middle line:84%
And that's probably
more like a symptom.

00:21:04.360 --> 00:21:07.450 align:middle line:84%
It's probably the smoke and
not the fire in my estimation.

00:21:07.450 --> 00:21:10.800 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Interesting, because
detoxing is, what, a $1 billion

00:21:10.800 --> 00:21:13.752 align:middle line:90%
industry or something by now?

00:21:13.752 --> 00:21:15.460 align:middle line:84%
>>PARK: What does that
even mean, though?

00:21:15.460 --> 00:21:17.430 align:middle line:90%
I mean, detoxing, you know, it--

00:21:17.430 --> 00:21:19.420 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Every kind
of detox product,

00:21:19.420 --> 00:21:23.830 align:middle line:84%
people that take people through
detox products and protocols

00:21:23.830 --> 00:21:24.330 align:middle line:90%
and--

00:21:24.330 --> 00:21:26.871 align:middle line:84%
>>PARK: The thing is, I think
that's more of a placebo effect

00:21:26.871 --> 00:21:30.460 align:middle line:84%
because people they
kind of ascribe

00:21:30.460 --> 00:21:33.370 align:middle line:90%
a spiritual valence to detox.

00:21:33.370 --> 00:21:36.740 align:middle line:84%
Their lives are toxic,
so if I do a cleanse

00:21:36.740 --> 00:21:40.620 align:middle line:84%
or I get rid of these things,
it kind of intuitively

00:21:40.620 --> 00:21:41.410 align:middle line:90%
gibes with us.

00:21:41.410 --> 00:21:44.380 align:middle line:84%
Now, whether your chromium
or your lead really goes down

00:21:44.380 --> 00:21:48.720 align:middle line:84%
or your cells really go into
apoptosis and get replaced

00:21:48.720 --> 00:21:50.850 align:middle line:90%
is questionable.

00:21:50.850 --> 00:21:54.290 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: I mean, there are
some very logical levels of it,

00:21:54.290 --> 00:21:55.920 align:middle line:84%
which is if you
eat a lot of sugar,

00:21:55.920 --> 00:21:57.841 align:middle line:84%
you probably have certain
things like candida

00:21:57.841 --> 00:22:00.340 align:middle line:84%
and other things in your cells
that you probably don't want.

00:22:00.340 --> 00:22:01.048 align:middle line:90%
>>PARK: All true.

00:22:01.048 --> 00:22:02.000 align:middle line:90%
All true.

00:22:02.000 --> 00:22:03.830 align:middle line:84%
But my mind was
looking for something

00:22:03.830 --> 00:22:04.870 align:middle line:90%
that's more fundamental.

00:22:04.870 --> 00:22:05.453 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:22:05.453 --> 00:22:08.010 align:middle line:84%
>>PARK: And that's
like one explanation.

00:22:08.010 --> 00:22:10.710 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: It
doesn't help to have

00:22:10.710 --> 00:22:14.770 align:middle line:84%
toxic chemicals and other
substances in the body.

00:22:14.770 --> 00:22:17.260 align:middle line:84%
But you're saying, that's
still not the thing that

00:22:17.260 --> 00:22:17.802 align:middle line:90%
makes us age.

00:22:17.802 --> 00:22:18.510 align:middle line:90%
>>PARK: Could be.

00:22:18.510 --> 00:22:21.420 align:middle line:84%
You know, I'm not-- I'm just out
here espousing my one theory.

00:22:21.420 --> 00:22:24.990 align:middle line:84%
But my one theory is so simple
that it kind of explains

00:22:24.990 --> 00:22:26.190 align:middle line:90%
all the other theories.

00:22:26.190 --> 00:22:29.080 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: OK, so let's now go
to the next one, oxidation.

00:22:29.080 --> 00:22:32.850 align:middle line:84%
And let's go back to
resveratrol and Q10.

00:22:32.850 --> 00:22:35.800 align:middle line:84%
I've taken Q10 for years
and with some good results,

00:22:35.800 --> 00:22:38.190 align:middle line:90%
especially early on.

00:22:38.190 --> 00:22:39.710 align:middle line:84%
Let's talk about
that, oxidation.

00:22:39.710 --> 00:22:40.360 align:middle line:84%
>>PARK: Well, this is
an interesting one.

00:22:40.360 --> 00:22:42.440 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Why do you
call it a red herring?

00:22:42.440 --> 00:22:46.680 align:middle line:84%
>>PARK: Well, yeah,
so oxidation is

00:22:46.680 --> 00:22:48.610 align:middle line:84%
when you look at
old and dying cells,

00:22:48.610 --> 00:22:51.590 align:middle line:84%
there's a lot of
oxidative species

00:22:51.590 --> 00:22:53.720 align:middle line:90%
or really reactive stuff.

00:22:53.720 --> 00:22:56.230 align:middle line:84%
And that comes from the
mitochondria primarily.

00:22:56.230 --> 00:22:59.180 align:middle line:84%
Mitochondria are like
little paramecium,

00:22:59.180 --> 00:23:01.230 align:middle line:84%
and they have
battery acid in them.

00:23:01.230 --> 00:23:03.430 align:middle line:84%
But the last step
before a cell knows

00:23:03.430 --> 00:23:05.130 align:middle line:84%
it's damaged and
tries to kill itself,

00:23:05.130 --> 00:23:07.380 align:middle line:84%
like the Wicked
Witch melts itself,

00:23:07.380 --> 00:23:09.795 align:middle line:84%
is it pokes a bunch of
holes into its mitochondria

00:23:09.795 --> 00:23:14.180 align:middle line:84%
and allows itself
to melt itself.

00:23:14.180 --> 00:23:16.420 align:middle line:84%
And there are many
triggers to that,

00:23:16.420 --> 00:23:19.040 align:middle line:84%
but the primary one
is-- the primary one

00:23:19.040 --> 00:23:23.870 align:middle line:84%
is the P53 mechanism, which
is a cell checks to make

00:23:23.870 --> 00:23:25.320 align:middle line:90%
sure it's DNA is OK.

00:23:25.320 --> 00:23:28.000 align:middle line:90%
If it's not OK, it kills itself.

00:23:28.000 --> 00:23:29.800 align:middle line:84%
And the way it does
that is by poking holes

00:23:29.800 --> 00:23:31.080 align:middle line:90%
in the mitochondria.

00:23:31.080 --> 00:23:32.845 align:middle line:84%
So it's kind of
like you go there,

00:23:32.845 --> 00:23:38.010 align:middle line:84%
and there's all this ash and
water and destroyed stuff,

00:23:38.010 --> 00:23:39.310 align:middle line:90%
and there was a fire.

00:23:39.310 --> 00:23:41.580 align:middle line:84%
But you don't think, well,
the arsonist was the cell.

00:23:41.580 --> 00:23:43.038 align:middle line:84%
The cell was trying
to kill itself.

00:23:43.038 --> 00:23:46.310 align:middle line:84%
So this whole great
intuitively appealing industry

00:23:46.310 --> 00:23:49.790 align:middle line:84%
was built around
antioxidants because we

00:23:49.790 --> 00:23:51.260 align:middle line:84%
know that old and
dying cells have

00:23:51.260 --> 00:23:54.520 align:middle line:84%
a lot of oxidation going
on, so let's try and squash

00:23:54.520 --> 00:23:55.660 align:middle line:90%
the oxidation.

00:23:55.660 --> 00:23:59.100 align:middle line:84%
But that may have been how the
cell was trying to kill itself,

00:23:59.100 --> 00:24:01.279 align:middle line:84%
so there may have been
something more proximate

00:24:01.279 --> 00:24:02.570 align:middle line:90%
that the cell was trying to do.

00:24:02.570 --> 00:24:03.590 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Still
something more primal,

00:24:03.590 --> 00:24:05.320 align:middle line:84%
which is interesting
when you're looking

00:24:05.320 --> 00:24:08.610 align:middle line:84%
at life on that
fundamental of level,

00:24:08.610 --> 00:24:13.030 align:middle line:84%
that cells, once they have
the indication that they're

00:24:13.030 --> 00:24:18.020 align:middle line:84%
no longer viable, will,
through a beautiful mechanism,

00:24:18.020 --> 00:24:19.260 align:middle line:90%
they'll kill themselves.

00:24:19.260 --> 00:24:20.420 align:middle line:90%
>>PARK: That's right.

00:24:20.420 --> 00:24:22.670 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: What's that say
about the whole notion

00:24:22.670 --> 00:24:24.295 align:middle line:90%
of competition?

00:24:24.295 --> 00:24:28.010 align:middle line:84%
You know, everything
competing for its own life

00:24:28.010 --> 00:24:30.420 align:middle line:84%
at the expense of the
whole, this really

00:24:30.420 --> 00:24:33.105 align:middle line:84%
shows us a very different
picture at a tiny level.

00:24:33.105 --> 00:24:34.730 align:middle line:84%
>>PARK: Well, that's
why I quoted this,

00:24:34.730 --> 00:24:36.740 align:middle line:84%
there's this Durkheim
quote at the beginning

00:24:36.740 --> 00:24:40.580 align:middle line:84%
of that chapter about
apoptois, the concept

00:24:40.580 --> 00:24:42.017 align:middle line:90%
of altruistic suicide.

00:24:42.017 --> 00:24:42.600 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:24:42.600 --> 00:24:46.039 align:middle line:84%
>>PARK: That doesn't exist
for us as well, maybe

00:24:46.039 --> 00:24:47.330 align:middle line:90%
in a heroic movie or something.

00:24:47.330 --> 00:24:49.310 align:middle line:84%
But you can't think
of it in terms

00:24:49.310 --> 00:24:53.210 align:middle line:84%
of like the cells are selfish,
or the genes are selfish.

00:24:53.210 --> 00:24:56.720 align:middle line:84%
They know they have a role
within the context of the organ

00:24:56.720 --> 00:25:00.170 align:middle line:84%
and the ecology of
that whole being.

00:25:00.170 --> 00:25:01.342 align:middle line:90%
And their prime directive.

00:25:01.342 --> 00:25:03.300 align:middle line:84%
If you will, to borrow
a term from "Star Trek,"

00:25:03.300 --> 00:25:04.700 align:middle line:90%
is to kill themselves.

00:25:04.700 --> 00:25:06.660 align:middle line:84%
Like they're constantly
monitoring themselves

00:25:06.660 --> 00:25:09.560 align:middle line:84%
for errors, and they
want to kill themselves.

00:25:09.560 --> 00:25:12.511 align:middle line:84%
They feel no passion
about dying because that's

00:25:12.511 --> 00:25:13.260 align:middle line:90%
their programming.

00:25:13.260 --> 00:25:15.910 align:middle line:84%
If I'm messed up,
then I'm going to die.

00:25:15.910 --> 00:25:17.860 align:middle line:84%
And so a lot of what
we have is cells

00:25:17.860 --> 00:25:21.830 align:middle line:84%
that go into a sort of
curmudgeonly grumpy old man

00:25:21.830 --> 00:25:22.654 align:middle line:90%
syndrome.

00:25:22.654 --> 00:25:24.570 align:middle line:84%
They go into senescence,
and they hang around.

00:25:24.570 --> 00:25:28.200 align:middle line:84%
They hold up that spot
in the stem cell niche.

00:25:28.200 --> 00:25:29.990 align:middle line:84%
So I believe that
adaptogens, the way

00:25:29.990 --> 00:25:34.560 align:middle line:84%
they work a lot is by coaxing
these cells to undergo suicide.

00:25:34.560 --> 00:25:36.920 align:middle line:84%
And then an empty
seat is freed up

00:25:36.920 --> 00:25:39.562 align:middle line:84%
and a newer, hopefully
better stem cell

00:25:39.562 --> 00:25:43.070 align:middle line:84%
will come and reconstitute
that whole niche.

00:25:43.070 --> 00:25:45.600 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: I just find
that interesting on a kind

00:25:45.600 --> 00:25:48.900 align:middle line:90%
of philosophical level even.

00:25:48.900 --> 00:25:51.809 align:middle line:84%
What about Richard Dawkins
and "The Selfish Gene?"

00:25:51.809 --> 00:25:52.350 align:middle line:90%
>>PARK: Yeah.

00:25:52.350 --> 00:25:55.470 align:middle line:84%
So you know, Richard Dawkins,
I think he's a genius.

00:25:55.470 --> 00:25:57.340 align:middle line:84%
And there are a lot
of these people.

00:25:57.340 --> 00:26:00.360 align:middle line:84%
But once you reach a
certain level of notoriety,

00:26:00.360 --> 00:26:03.830 align:middle line:84%
you kind of-- anything you say
is taken as some kind of tablet

00:26:03.830 --> 00:26:05.420 align:middle line:90%
from the mountain.

00:26:05.420 --> 00:26:07.480 align:middle line:84%
And so his whole
version of atheism

00:26:07.480 --> 00:26:10.480 align:middle line:84%
is kind of religious in
and of itself, I think.

00:26:10.480 --> 00:26:13.460 align:middle line:90%
But like Hameroff, we talked--

00:26:13.460 --> 00:26:14.750 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Stuart Hameroff.

00:26:14.750 --> 00:26:15.610 align:middle line:90%
>>PARK: Right.

00:26:15.610 --> 00:26:17.306 align:middle line:84%
His idea was,
well, microtubules,

00:26:17.306 --> 00:26:18.680 align:middle line:84%
nobody understands
how they work,

00:26:18.680 --> 00:26:20.980 align:middle line:84%
so that must be the
locus of action.

00:26:20.980 --> 00:26:22.940 align:middle line:84%
They're getting
a cosmic download

00:26:22.940 --> 00:26:24.540 align:middle line:90%
from source consciousness.

00:26:24.540 --> 00:26:29.190 align:middle line:84%
Well, he just chose to focus at
that level of depth of field.

00:26:29.190 --> 00:26:31.570 align:middle line:84%
Dawkins focused on
the selfish gene,

00:26:31.570 --> 00:26:35.960 align:middle line:84%
which is-- I don't think
evolution occurs on that level.

00:26:35.960 --> 00:26:40.140 align:middle line:84%
Most of the Darwinian evolution
is on the species level, right?

00:26:40.140 --> 00:26:43.380 align:middle line:84%
But I think that when we
focus on just one theory

00:26:43.380 --> 00:26:47.470 align:middle line:84%
to the exclusion of
others, we get closer

00:26:47.470 --> 00:26:49.690 align:middle line:84%
to a reductionist truth,
but we don't get closer

00:26:49.690 --> 00:26:51.920 align:middle line:84%
to the real truth which
is that everything

00:26:51.920 --> 00:26:55.694 align:middle line:84%
is a conscious co-creation,
to use that very trite term.

00:26:55.694 --> 00:26:56.860 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: No, but it's true.

00:26:56.860 --> 00:26:57.501 align:middle line:90%
>>PARK: Yeah.

00:26:57.501 --> 00:26:58.042 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: OK.

00:26:58.042 --> 00:27:01.690 align:middle line:84%
Now let's talk about where-- you
alluded to it a little bit ago.

00:27:01.690 --> 00:27:05.067 align:middle line:84%
Where do stem cells
come into all of this?

00:27:05.067 --> 00:27:05.650 align:middle line:90%
>>PARK: Right.

00:27:05.650 --> 00:27:08.820 align:middle line:84%
So if you read my book,
"Telomere Timebombs,"

00:27:08.820 --> 00:27:12.260 align:middle line:84%
we kind of go through all those
theories, try to debunk them.

00:27:12.260 --> 00:27:14.430 align:middle line:84%
But the thing that made
the most sense to me

00:27:14.430 --> 00:27:16.590 align:middle line:90%
was that, OK, this is a truism.

00:27:16.590 --> 00:27:18.690 align:middle line:90%
All DNA is copied.

00:27:18.690 --> 00:27:21.910 align:middle line:84%
But you can't copy to the very
end, so it shortens just a bit.

00:27:21.910 --> 00:27:23.670 align:middle line:90%
It's a mechanical thing.

00:27:23.670 --> 00:27:25.840 align:middle line:84%
So in regular cells, we've
known for a long time

00:27:25.840 --> 00:27:27.880 align:middle line:84%
that if you put regular
cells in a dish,

00:27:27.880 --> 00:27:30.340 align:middle line:84%
contrary to what was believed,
they're not immortal.

00:27:30.340 --> 00:27:33.030 align:middle line:84%
They'll divide 40 to 60
times, and then they'll

00:27:33.030 --> 00:27:36.290 align:middle line:90%
become old and just peter out.

00:27:36.290 --> 00:27:40.710 align:middle line:84%
But in 2009, they acknowledged
this decades-old discovery

00:27:40.710 --> 00:27:44.680 align:middle line:84%
that eukaryotes-- or fungi,
plants, and animals--

00:27:44.680 --> 00:27:46.360 align:middle line:84%
have a telomerase
enzyme which is

00:27:46.360 --> 00:27:50.710 align:middle line:84%
a micro-machine in that
cell which will relengthen.

00:27:50.710 --> 00:27:53.610 align:middle line:84%
So if you look at the
ends of chromosomes--

00:27:53.610 --> 00:27:55.940 align:middle line:84%
and of course, all
plants, animals,

00:27:55.940 --> 00:27:58.900 align:middle line:84%
fungi have chromosomes
that are like bow ties.

00:27:58.900 --> 00:28:00.760 align:middle line:84%
And at the ends,
there are these tips.

00:28:00.760 --> 00:28:03.150 align:middle line:84%
The tips are like
firecracker fuses.

00:28:03.150 --> 00:28:06.120 align:middle line:84%
So quite literally, if they
get to the melting point,

00:28:06.120 --> 00:28:09.220 align:middle line:84%
where they're at the end--
and this is not fringe theory.

00:28:09.220 --> 00:28:12.880 align:middle line:84%
This is the fundamental
bedrock of molecular biology.

00:28:12.880 --> 00:28:14.890 align:middle line:84%
Those chromosomes
will recombine.

00:28:14.890 --> 00:28:15.980 align:middle line:90%
They'll cause mutations.

00:28:15.980 --> 00:28:20.860 align:middle line:84%
And we're off to cellular
dysfunction and maybe death.

00:28:20.860 --> 00:28:24.100 align:middle line:84%
So the telomerase
allows it to relengthen,

00:28:24.100 --> 00:28:26.240 align:middle line:84%
and so that's what
a stem cell is.

00:28:26.240 --> 00:28:28.485 align:middle line:84%
A stem cell is an
enzyme-- or I'm sorry,

00:28:28.485 --> 00:28:32.850 align:middle line:84%
a stem cell is a cell that is
able to use telomerase to stay

00:28:32.850 --> 00:28:34.840 align:middle line:90%
alive forever.

00:28:34.840 --> 00:28:37.160 align:middle line:84%
And then it also
divides asymmetrically

00:28:37.160 --> 00:28:39.970 align:middle line:84%
which means it's a
master copy, and it makes

00:28:39.970 --> 00:28:42.020 align:middle line:90%
a more differentiated cell.

00:28:42.020 --> 00:28:46.530 align:middle line:84%
So my theory is that all
of aging and disease,

00:28:46.530 --> 00:28:49.730 align:middle line:84%
even though there are
specific congenital diseases,

00:28:49.730 --> 00:28:52.670 align:middle line:84%
there are things that can cause
disease in different ways,

00:28:52.670 --> 00:28:57.380 align:middle line:84%
it all boils down to the fact
that telomeres are shortening,

00:28:57.380 --> 00:28:58.900 align:middle line:84%
and they're causing
genetic damage.

00:28:58.900 --> 00:29:01.580 align:middle line:10%
And so if it manifests in the
pancreas, you get diabetes.

00:29:01.580 --> 00:29:03.280 align:middle line:10%
In the brain, you
get Alzheimer's.

00:29:03.280 --> 00:29:06.610 align:middle line:84%
I believe it's one
disease with many faces.

00:29:06.610 --> 00:29:09.060 align:middle line:84%
And the nice thing
is at the core of it,

00:29:09.060 --> 00:29:11.290 align:middle line:84%
the cells are able to
recognize, as we've said,

00:29:11.290 --> 00:29:12.540 align:middle line:90%
their dysfunction.

00:29:12.540 --> 00:29:13.770 align:middle line:90%
They kill themselves.

00:29:13.770 --> 00:29:16.350 align:middle line:84%
So the body is in a
constant state of renewal.

00:29:16.350 --> 00:29:20.590 align:middle line:84%
And the ecology is set up
so that we can live forever.

00:29:20.590 --> 00:29:23.270 align:middle line:84%
So going back to why
take it in the 20s,

00:29:23.270 --> 00:29:26.500 align:middle line:84%
if you bought a Lamborghini,
you wouldn't change the oil

00:29:26.500 --> 00:29:27.800 align:middle line:90%
every 30,000 miles.

00:29:27.800 --> 00:29:31.020 align:middle line:84%
You would change it
every 1,500 miles.

00:29:31.020 --> 00:29:32.430 align:middle line:90%
And you would maintain it.

00:29:32.430 --> 00:29:36.960 align:middle line:84%
So it's easier to prevent
damage before it occurs.

00:29:36.960 --> 00:29:39.590 align:middle line:84%
Once you get into
someone who's 112,

00:29:39.590 --> 00:29:42.430 align:middle line:84%
it's very hard, because if you
kill off the bad cells, OK,

00:29:42.430 --> 00:29:45.540 align:middle line:84%
maybe there are some good
pigment-producing cells that

00:29:45.540 --> 00:29:47.440 align:middle line:90%
have been dormant.

00:29:47.440 --> 00:29:49.510 align:middle line:84%
But the replacement
versions that come in

00:29:49.510 --> 00:29:53.380 align:middle line:90%
aren't that hot either.

00:29:53.380 --> 00:29:55.610 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Let's continue
on stem cells for a moment,

00:29:55.610 --> 00:29:59.341 align:middle line:84%
because all kinds of
ingenious stem cell therapies

00:29:59.341 --> 00:30:00.840 align:middle line:84%
have made their way
onto the market.

00:30:00.840 --> 00:30:02.830 align:middle line:84%
You can buy face cream with
stem cells in it now, right?

00:30:02.830 --> 00:30:03.460 align:middle line:90%
>>PARK: Yeah.

00:30:03.460 --> 00:30:04.520 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: OK.

00:30:04.520 --> 00:30:06.180 align:middle line:84%
When it gets to
that level, I have

00:30:06.180 --> 00:30:10.520 align:middle line:84%
to start asking some questions
about the integrity of it.

00:30:10.520 --> 00:30:13.670 align:middle line:84%
Not that it's not
good or not working,

00:30:13.670 --> 00:30:15.750 align:middle line:90%
but I would like to know more.

00:30:15.750 --> 00:30:19.240 align:middle line:84%
And you said in the book that
the problem with stem cell

00:30:19.240 --> 00:30:22.740 align:middle line:84%
therapy is if it is not
your own source stem cells,

00:30:22.740 --> 00:30:25.716 align:middle line:84%
and particularly if
it's from other species,

00:30:25.716 --> 00:30:27.040 align:middle line:90%
it's not going to work, right?

00:30:27.040 --> 00:30:27.400 align:middle line:90%
>>PARK: Right.

00:30:27.400 --> 00:30:29.360 align:middle line:84%
So unfortunately, people
are a little bit lazy.

00:30:29.360 --> 00:30:31.330 align:middle line:90%
They use mental shorthand.

00:30:31.330 --> 00:30:34.650 align:middle line:90%
Stem cells good, stem cells bad.

00:30:34.650 --> 00:30:38.340 align:middle line:84%
I mean, stem cells are just
master copies, like queen bees.

00:30:38.340 --> 00:30:40.610 align:middle line:84%
And it's just how
the system is set up,

00:30:40.610 --> 00:30:43.920 align:middle line:84%
like not every cell in
our liver is a stem cell.

00:30:43.920 --> 00:30:47.130 align:middle line:84%
They're very rare,
so it's just a truism

00:30:47.130 --> 00:30:51.210 align:middle line:84%
that all the daughters from that
one mom printing out her copies

00:30:51.210 --> 00:30:53.230 align:middle line:84%
bear the same
genetic good things

00:30:53.230 --> 00:30:56.530 align:middle line:84%
but mostly bad things or
errors that she's accumulated.

00:30:56.530 --> 00:31:00.990 align:middle line:84%
So when you take stem cell
therapy from a black goat,

00:31:00.990 --> 00:31:05.140 align:middle line:84%
there's a lot of incompatibility
because the exterior

00:31:05.140 --> 00:31:07.680 align:middle line:84%
histocompatibility antigens
are totally mismatched,

00:31:07.680 --> 00:31:10.500 align:middle line:84%
so you get host versus
graft disease, which

00:31:10.500 --> 00:31:14.540 align:middle line:84%
is a fancy way of saying,
within hours of laying down

00:31:14.540 --> 00:31:18.170 align:middle line:84%
your $10,000, your
body has already

00:31:18.170 --> 00:31:19.725 align:middle line:90%
destroyed those foreign cells.

00:31:19.725 --> 00:31:20.310 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Started
adapting, yeah.

00:31:20.310 --> 00:31:22.660 align:middle line:84%
>>PARK: And you're left to
whatever placebo effect there

00:31:22.660 --> 00:31:23.700 align:middle line:90%
might be.

00:31:23.700 --> 00:31:29.300 align:middle line:84%
Now if you take another
person's cells, then maybe

00:31:29.300 --> 00:31:30.949 align:middle line:84%
a little less,
maybe if it was cord

00:31:30.949 --> 00:31:32.990 align:middle line:84%
blood from your twin
sister, maybe a little less.

00:31:32.990 --> 00:31:33.860 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: I was going
to ask about that.

00:31:33.860 --> 00:31:34.180 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:31:34.180 --> 00:31:35.555 align:middle line:84%
>>PARK: And if
it's from yourself

00:31:35.555 --> 00:31:38.910 align:middle line:84%
when your mom banked it on the
date of your birth, even less.

00:31:38.910 --> 00:31:41.450 align:middle line:84%
But the gold standard
of stem therapy

00:31:41.450 --> 00:31:44.399 align:middle line:84%
is what's coming very
soon, which is your own.

00:31:44.399 --> 00:31:46.190 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Well, I was
wondering about that,

00:31:46.190 --> 00:31:52.850 align:middle line:84%
that's derived from
adipose tissue for example.

00:31:52.850 --> 00:31:57.260 align:middle line:84%
How do they get the best source
of someone, a mature person's

00:31:57.260 --> 00:31:59.010 align:middle line:90%
stem cells?

00:31:59.010 --> 00:31:59.957 align:middle line:90%
>>PARK: Good question.

00:31:59.957 --> 00:32:02.040 align:middle line:84%
I don't really-- this is
not my area of expertise.

00:32:02.040 --> 00:32:04.440 align:middle line:84%
From what I understand, you
go and you get a liposuction.

00:32:04.440 --> 00:32:06.830 align:middle line:84%
They have markers
for your stem cells.

00:32:06.830 --> 00:32:09.230 align:middle line:84%
And then they could
transfuse them back.

00:32:09.230 --> 00:32:15.210 align:middle line:84%
But it's really on
the level of-- I don't

00:32:15.210 --> 00:32:16.800 align:middle line:90%
want to use a pejorative word.

00:32:16.800 --> 00:32:22.870 align:middle line:84%
But it's not really that ready
for prime time, let's say.

00:32:22.870 --> 00:32:24.522 align:middle line:84%
I mean, yes, it helps
a lot of people.

00:32:24.522 --> 00:32:25.980 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: The
science is still new.

00:32:25.980 --> 00:32:28.320 align:middle line:84%
>>PARK: But it's not like
you can just use a tricorder

00:32:28.320 --> 00:32:29.860 align:middle line:84%
and say, these are
the stem cells.

00:32:29.860 --> 00:32:31.680 align:middle line:84%
We're going to
custom-differentiate them

00:32:31.680 --> 00:32:33.730 align:middle line:84%
and put them back
into your retina.

00:32:33.730 --> 00:32:34.530 align:middle line:90%
It's getting there.

00:32:34.530 --> 00:32:35.270 align:middle line:90%
It'll get there.

00:32:35.270 --> 00:32:37.930 align:middle line:84%
But I was trying to get
the point that custom stem

00:32:37.930 --> 00:32:39.395 align:middle line:90%
cells is really the way to go.

00:32:39.395 --> 00:32:40.520 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: So how's that go?

00:32:40.520 --> 00:32:41.312 align:middle line:90%
How does that work?

00:32:41.312 --> 00:32:42.020 align:middle line:90%
>>PARK: Well, OK.

00:32:42.020 --> 00:32:45.170 align:middle line:84%
So if you take out my stem
cells from my adipose,

00:32:45.170 --> 00:32:47.090 align:middle line:90%
they're 47-year-old stem cells.

00:32:47.090 --> 00:32:50.280 align:middle line:84%
They've acquired all the errors
of all their predecessors.

00:32:50.280 --> 00:32:54.410 align:middle line:84%
If my mom had the foresight
to bank my perfect DNA,

00:32:54.410 --> 00:32:56.900 align:middle line:84%
or as perfect as it
comes, when I was young,

00:32:56.900 --> 00:32:59.840 align:middle line:84%
you'll have a good library,
"Encyclopedia Britannica"

00:32:59.840 --> 00:33:01.830 align:middle line:84%
first day of
manufacture, and then

00:33:01.830 --> 00:33:06.874 align:middle line:84%
you can take that and put
it into a healthy vehicle.

00:33:06.874 --> 00:33:08.790 align:middle line:84%
And then they'll be able
to throw the switches

00:33:08.790 --> 00:33:12.210 align:middle line:84%
and custom-differentiate
every organ,

00:33:12.210 --> 00:33:14.630 align:middle line:84%
hopefully without any
histocompatibility issues,

00:33:14.630 --> 00:33:17.370 align:middle line:84%
so you can get your own
custom liver, kidney back.

00:33:17.370 --> 00:33:20.479 align:middle line:84%
That's better
immunologically speaking.

00:33:20.479 --> 00:33:22.270 align:middle line:84%
And they're getting
better at understanding

00:33:22.270 --> 00:33:24.970 align:middle line:90%
how to force differentiation.

00:33:24.970 --> 00:33:27.030 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Including
with mature stem

00:33:27.030 --> 00:33:28.719 align:middle line:90%
cells from the adipose tissue?

00:33:28.719 --> 00:33:29.260 align:middle line:90%
>>PARK: Yeah.

00:33:29.260 --> 00:33:29.580 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:33:29.580 --> 00:33:30.413 align:middle line:90%
I mean, that's good.

00:33:30.413 --> 00:33:31.890 align:middle line:84%
But they just this
year learned how

00:33:31.890 --> 00:33:36.360 align:middle line:84%
to do cloning so they could take
your DNA, as good as it gets,

00:33:36.360 --> 00:33:37.690 align:middle line:90%
and put it into a healthy cell.

00:33:37.690 --> 00:33:40.850 align:middle line:84%
And that's really
going to be the gold--

00:33:40.850 --> 00:33:43.690 align:middle line:84%
or the next frontier,
because you'll be 120

00:33:43.690 --> 00:33:45.790 align:middle line:84%
but you'll look like
you're 20, because you

00:33:45.790 --> 00:33:48.120 align:middle line:84%
have all brand new
replacement parts.

00:33:48.120 --> 00:33:52.540 align:middle line:84%
You can drive a Model T now
that looks nice because they

00:33:52.540 --> 00:33:54.280 align:middle line:90%
make new parts for it.

00:33:54.280 --> 00:33:55.247 align:middle line:90%
It's still a Model T.

00:33:55.247 --> 00:33:57.080 align:middle line:84%
And that's kind of the
model we're going at.

00:33:57.080 --> 00:33:59.250 align:middle line:84%
We're not looking
at some magic here.

00:33:59.250 --> 00:34:01.979 align:middle line:84%
We're just talking about custom
replacement stem cell parts.

00:34:01.979 --> 00:34:02.520 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: No.

00:34:02.520 --> 00:34:05.550 align:middle line:84%
It is a fascinating
area under development.

00:34:05.550 --> 00:34:06.050 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:34:06.050 --> 00:34:08.550 align:middle line:84%
Now let's talk about
the extreme examples,

00:34:08.550 --> 00:34:11.170 align:middle line:84%
where a body, a
little young person

00:34:11.170 --> 00:34:12.699 align:middle line:90%
is aging extremely rapidly.

00:34:12.699 --> 00:34:14.111 align:middle line:90%
Is it called progeria?

00:34:14.111 --> 00:34:14.610 align:middle line:90%
>>PARK: Yes.

00:34:14.610 --> 00:34:16.090 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Progeria.

00:34:16.090 --> 00:34:18.090 align:middle line:84%
>>PARK: Well, now this
is the interesting thing.

00:34:18.090 --> 00:34:19.719 align:middle line:84%
And this is the
validation for why

00:34:19.719 --> 00:34:22.130 align:middle line:84%
I think the stem cell
and the telomerase

00:34:22.130 --> 00:34:25.719 align:middle line:84%
are the key because there
are many forms of progeria.

00:34:25.719 --> 00:34:29.040 align:middle line:84%
But one of the most classic
is when the telomerase is not

00:34:29.040 --> 00:34:30.010 align:middle line:90%
working.

00:34:30.010 --> 00:34:34.080 align:middle line:84%
And then you get at the age of
10 to 14, senescence and death.

00:34:34.080 --> 00:34:37.469 align:middle line:84%
People die of Alzheimer's,
heart disease, sometimes cancer.

00:34:37.469 --> 00:34:38.750 align:middle line:90%
They're old people.

00:34:38.750 --> 00:34:42.270 align:middle line:84%
So we have a natural
model for aging.

00:34:42.270 --> 00:34:46.719 align:middle line:84%
And so it would be exciting
to used telomerase activators

00:34:46.719 --> 00:34:50.090 align:middle line:84%
or maybe gene therapy to
see if we can stave that

00:34:50.090 --> 00:34:53.739 align:middle line:84%
off or reverse that because in
the mouse in different ways,

00:34:53.739 --> 00:34:55.280 align:middle line:84%
three different
types of experiments,

00:34:55.280 --> 00:34:58.150 align:middle line:84%
we have seen actual
age reversal.

00:34:58.150 --> 00:35:01.620 align:middle line:84%
So that's something that of
course is very exciting to us.

00:35:01.620 --> 00:35:03.490 align:middle line:84%
But when we talk about
telomerase activation

00:35:03.490 --> 00:35:07.150 align:middle line:84%
or adaptogens in general,
it's like stem cell therapy

00:35:07.150 --> 00:35:09.940 align:middle line:84%
that you don't go to
Venezuela or Vietnam for.

00:35:09.940 --> 00:35:11.660 align:middle line:84%
What it's really
doing, I believe,

00:35:11.660 --> 00:35:15.020 align:middle line:84%
is causing apoptosis in
the dysfunctional cells,

00:35:15.020 --> 00:35:16.790 align:middle line:90%
or sometimes senescence.

00:35:16.790 --> 00:35:18.670 align:middle line:84%
And it's allowing
your own ecology

00:35:18.670 --> 00:35:23.560 align:middle line:84%
to replace it with something
better and more effective,

00:35:23.560 --> 00:35:25.130 align:middle line:90%
we hope.

00:35:25.130 --> 00:35:27.320 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So as you say,
that differentiation

00:35:27.320 --> 00:35:34.490 align:middle line:84%
of the cellular redevelopment
is happening through whatever

00:35:34.490 --> 00:35:36.560 align:middle line:90%
adaptogen you may be using.

00:35:36.560 --> 00:35:38.250 align:middle line:84%
It can happen through
a number of them.

00:35:38.250 --> 00:35:41.590 align:middle line:84%
It's just that one that's
been particularly effective

00:35:41.590 --> 00:35:43.729 align:middle line:90%
has been discovered, right?

00:35:43.729 --> 00:35:44.270 align:middle line:90%
And this is--

00:35:44.270 --> 00:35:45.030 align:middle line:90%
>>PARK: I think so.

00:35:45.030 --> 00:35:45.450 align:middle line:90%
I think so.

00:35:45.450 --> 00:35:47.116 align:middle line:84%
Well, you know, it's
really interesting,

00:35:47.116 --> 00:35:49.520 align:middle line:84%
because our friend
Suzanne Somers,

00:35:49.520 --> 00:35:53.330 align:middle line:84%
she was instrumental in
getting breast reconstructive

00:35:53.330 --> 00:35:54.710 align:middle line:90%
stem cell therapy.

00:35:54.710 --> 00:35:57.202 align:middle line:84%
But you know, the breast shape
will regress after a while

00:35:57.202 --> 00:35:58.660 align:middle line:84%
because what you're
really doing is

00:35:58.660 --> 00:36:02.664 align:middle line:84%
you're putting 200 chairs
into a gymnasium that's only

00:36:02.664 --> 00:36:03.830 align:middle line:90%
supposed to have 100 chairs.

00:36:03.830 --> 00:36:06.720 align:middle line:84%
So it's not just-- our
system is fundamentally

00:36:06.720 --> 00:36:11.220 align:middle line:84%
designed to use these things
called mesenchymal stem cells.

00:36:11.220 --> 00:36:14.440 align:middle line:84%
They're frozen in your
cartilage for decades.

00:36:14.440 --> 00:36:17.230 align:middle line:84%
And so when a signal
goes out that says,

00:36:17.230 --> 00:36:20.370 align:middle line:84%
we've had massive damage, we
need replacement queen bees

00:36:20.370 --> 00:36:22.820 align:middle line:84%
throughout the body
or in just one place,

00:36:22.820 --> 00:36:26.300 align:middle line:84%
these mesenchymal stem cells
are thawed out like TV dinners.

00:36:26.300 --> 00:36:28.420 align:middle line:84%
They go to the spot where
there's a job vacancy.

00:36:28.420 --> 00:36:30.670 align:middle line:84%
And then they'll differentiate
into a liver cell.

00:36:30.670 --> 00:36:32.610 align:middle line:84%
And as we learn more,
they can differentiate

00:36:32.610 --> 00:36:33.830 align:middle line:90%
into cardiac, everything.

00:36:33.830 --> 00:36:35.110 align:middle line:90%
So they're kind of a factotum.

00:36:35.110 --> 00:36:36.190 align:middle line:90%
They do it all.

00:36:36.190 --> 00:36:36.690 align:middle line:90%
Handyman.

00:36:36.690 --> 00:36:39.170 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: What an amazing
mechanism in the body.

00:36:39.170 --> 00:36:40.870 align:middle line:84%
So essentially, are
you saying those

00:36:40.870 --> 00:36:45.330 align:middle line:84%
are the original "Encyclopedia
Britannica" type of cells that

00:36:45.330 --> 00:36:46.870 align:middle line:84%
are just frozen
there in each of us

00:36:46.870 --> 00:36:48.920 align:middle line:84%
waiting until they have
to be called into action?

00:36:48.920 --> 00:36:50.420 align:middle line:84%
>>PARK: It's a very
ingenious system

00:36:50.420 --> 00:36:52.890 align:middle line:84%
because it's in frozen
suspended animation.

00:36:52.890 --> 00:36:58.280 align:middle line:84%
But if you try and send that
in to a place where they're

00:36:58.280 --> 00:37:00.970 align:middle line:84%
already filled with a bunch
of dysfunctional cells

00:37:00.970 --> 00:37:03.190 align:middle line:84%
that aren't giving
up their jobs,

00:37:03.190 --> 00:37:05.280 align:middle line:84%
those are the queen bees
there, it doesn't work.

00:37:05.280 --> 00:37:07.340 align:middle line:84%
So that's the problem
with stem cell therapy.

00:37:07.340 --> 00:37:10.120 align:middle line:84%
You may get a transient
effect, but the real problem

00:37:10.120 --> 00:37:12.770 align:middle line:84%
is that your organs are
bathed in stem cells,

00:37:12.770 --> 00:37:14.150 align:middle line:90%
and there's no job vacancies.

00:37:14.150 --> 00:37:17.250 align:middle line:84%
So unless you can target
them, kill them, and then

00:37:17.250 --> 00:37:19.570 align:middle line:84%
get fresh mesenchymal
troops to come in

00:37:19.570 --> 00:37:21.881 align:middle line:84%
and differentiate into
healthier queen bees,

00:37:21.881 --> 00:37:23.630 align:middle line:84%
you don't get a lot
of bang for your buck.

00:37:23.630 --> 00:37:23.950 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: OK.

00:37:23.950 --> 00:37:26.350 align:middle line:84%
Now that's bringing me to
the subject of chemotherapy,

00:37:26.350 --> 00:37:29.886 align:middle line:84%
and what it's actually
doing in the body.

00:37:29.886 --> 00:37:32.620 align:middle line:84%
>>PARK: Well,
chemotherapy is great

00:37:32.620 --> 00:37:34.520 align:middle line:90%
if you're one of the lucky ones.

00:37:34.520 --> 00:37:37.150 align:middle line:84%
But because it's a
generalized poison,

00:37:37.150 --> 00:37:40.870 align:middle line:84%
it attacks all
healthy cells too,

00:37:40.870 --> 00:37:45.710 align:middle line:84%
all your immune system, your
hair, your gut, and your brain.

00:37:45.710 --> 00:37:48.360 align:middle line:84%
So all the healthy cells
that are reproducing get

00:37:48.360 --> 00:37:49.230 align:middle line:90%
attacked too.

00:37:49.230 --> 00:37:52.290 align:middle line:84%
So your goal is, it's kind of
like you have a hostage, bank

00:37:52.290 --> 00:37:53.470 align:middle line:90%
hostage situation.

00:37:53.470 --> 00:37:55.640 align:middle line:84%
You throw in sarin
gas, and you're

00:37:55.640 --> 00:37:58.550 align:middle line:84%
hoping that the good
guys will survive.

00:37:58.550 --> 00:38:01.660 align:middle line:84%
But when you do something
that's an adaptogen,

00:38:01.660 --> 00:38:05.140 align:middle line:84%
or healthy holistic things,
you take the opposite approach,

00:38:05.140 --> 00:38:05.640 align:middle line:90%
right?

00:38:05.640 --> 00:38:08.355 align:middle line:84%
You're not trying to poison
everyone and hope for the best.

00:38:08.355 --> 00:38:10.230 align:middle line:84%
What you're trying to
do is empower everyone.

00:38:10.230 --> 00:38:12.835 align:middle line:84%
So it's like sending a crate
full of automatic weapons

00:38:12.835 --> 00:38:13.835 align:middle line:90%
into the bank situation.

00:38:13.835 --> 00:38:17.420 align:middle line:84%
You hope that the immune
system overwhelms the bad guys,

00:38:17.420 --> 00:38:18.630 align:middle line:90%
so it's very opposite.

00:38:18.630 --> 00:38:20.660 align:middle line:84%
And I think that years
from now we'll say,

00:38:20.660 --> 00:38:22.660 align:middle line:84%
oh my god, I can't believe
we gave chemotherapy.

00:38:22.660 --> 00:38:26.345 align:middle line:84%
It's so primitive and barbaric
because it is so nonspecific.

00:38:26.345 --> 00:38:27.970 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: What does
that do to the stem

00:38:27.970 --> 00:38:31.910 align:middle line:84%
cells that have been waiting,
in wait to perform their job?

00:38:31.910 --> 00:38:33.837 align:middle line:84%
What happens to them
during chemotherapy?

00:38:33.837 --> 00:38:36.170 align:middle line:84%
>>PARK: Well, yeah, I mean,
it kills all the stem cells,

00:38:36.170 --> 00:38:36.700 align:middle line:90%
doesn't it?

00:38:36.700 --> 00:38:39.350 align:middle line:84%
So you're hoping
that in the cartilage

00:38:39.350 --> 00:38:41.490 align:middle line:84%
or in the frozen reserve
bank because they're

00:38:41.490 --> 00:38:44.350 align:middle line:84%
in frozen stasis, they
haven't been affected.

00:38:44.350 --> 00:38:46.560 align:middle line:84%
And there's no reason to
think that they would be.

00:38:46.560 --> 00:38:47.518 align:middle line:90%
But that's the problem.

00:38:47.518 --> 00:38:49.960 align:middle line:84%
When you nuke someone's
immune system,

00:38:49.960 --> 00:38:53.982 align:middle line:90%
then it's kind of dicey to know.

00:38:53.982 --> 00:38:55.940 align:middle line:84%
That's why the stem cell
bone marrow transplant

00:38:55.940 --> 00:38:58.890 align:middle line:90%
has had a rough start.

00:38:58.890 --> 00:38:59.830 align:middle line:90%
You kill everything.

00:38:59.830 --> 00:39:03.030 align:middle line:84%
And you need to have a
system to reconstitute

00:39:03.030 --> 00:39:04.540 align:middle line:90%
a healthy immune system.

00:39:04.540 --> 00:39:06.780 align:middle line:90%
And that's not always a gimme.

00:39:06.780 --> 00:39:07.610 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:39:07.610 --> 00:39:08.110 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:39:08.110 --> 00:39:09.130 align:middle line:90%
There's another area.

00:39:09.130 --> 00:39:12.300 align:middle line:84%
Now we're going into the
longevity of cells again,

00:39:12.300 --> 00:39:13.819 align:middle line:90%
Alex or is it Alexis Carrel?

00:39:13.819 --> 00:39:14.360 align:middle line:90%
>>PARK: Yeah.

00:39:14.360 --> 00:39:15.130 align:middle line:90%
Alexis Carrel.

00:39:15.130 --> 00:39:16.320 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Alexis Carrel.

00:39:16.320 --> 00:39:19.454 align:middle line:84%
And is it the chicken
liver or chicken heart?

00:39:19.454 --> 00:39:20.620 align:middle line:90%
>>PARK: Chicken heart, yeah.

00:39:20.620 --> 00:39:23.160 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Cells that remained
alive for a very long period.

00:39:23.160 --> 00:39:25.720 align:middle line:84%
Tell us about that so we
can get a glimpse of what

00:39:25.720 --> 00:39:30.370 align:middle line:84%
can maintain cellular life for
this ridiculous amount of time.

00:39:30.370 --> 00:39:32.755 align:middle line:84%
>>PARK: Well, that's the
interesting thing about dogma

00:39:32.755 --> 00:39:36.670 align:middle line:84%
and how slowly we used to
acquire new information.

00:39:36.670 --> 00:39:39.910 align:middle line:84%
This was-- I think he
was a Hungarian Nazi,

00:39:39.910 --> 00:39:42.160 align:middle line:84%
but you know, a
friend of Lindbergh.

00:39:42.160 --> 00:39:43.860 align:middle line:84%
But he was famous,
I think he might

00:39:43.860 --> 00:39:45.830 align:middle line:84%
have won a Nobel
or some big prize,

00:39:45.830 --> 00:39:47.610 align:middle line:84%
cover of "Time,"
for these chicken

00:39:47.610 --> 00:39:51.250 align:middle line:84%
embryo cells that stayed alive
for 30 years or something.

00:39:51.250 --> 00:39:54.880 align:middle line:84%
And people thought it
was like that was it.

00:39:54.880 --> 00:39:59.110 align:middle line:84%
He decided, no one checked it,
chicken embryos live forever,

00:39:59.110 --> 00:40:01.300 align:middle line:90%
hence all cells live forever.

00:40:01.300 --> 00:40:03.300 align:middle line:84%
And then this other
gentlemen, Leonard Hayflick,

00:40:03.300 --> 00:40:08.720 align:middle line:84%
came in, who was interviewed
in "The Immortalists,"

00:40:08.720 --> 00:40:10.090 align:middle line:90%
of Jewish descent.

00:40:10.090 --> 00:40:11.900 align:middle line:84%
And he put dishes--
or I'm sorry.

00:40:11.900 --> 00:40:13.220 align:middle line:90%
He put cells in a dish.

00:40:13.220 --> 00:40:15.380 align:middle line:84%
And they only lived
40 to 60 generations.

00:40:15.380 --> 00:40:17.120 align:middle line:84%
And then for the next
50 years everyone

00:40:17.120 --> 00:40:18.390 align:middle line:90%
thought, oh, Hayflick's right.

00:40:18.390 --> 00:40:20.460 align:middle line:90%
Carrel was wrong.

00:40:20.460 --> 00:40:22.600 align:middle line:84%
Cells only live a
certain amount of time.

00:40:22.600 --> 00:40:24.390 align:middle line:84%
And they weren't
sure, but they thought

00:40:24.390 --> 00:40:26.640 align:middle line:84%
it was because of the
end replication problem,

00:40:26.640 --> 00:40:28.490 align:middle line:90%
the erosion of the telomeres.

00:40:28.490 --> 00:40:31.130 align:middle line:84%
Well, come to find that
they're both right.

00:40:31.130 --> 00:40:36.140 align:middle line:84%
Depending on how stem-like or
how much telomerase activity

00:40:36.140 --> 00:40:40.180 align:middle line:84%
occurs, a cell can be immortal,
like these Henrietta Lacks

00:40:40.180 --> 00:40:42.260 align:middle line:90%
cells, like all cancer cells.

00:40:42.260 --> 00:40:45.970 align:middle line:84%
So like all your sperm and
eggs, they're immortal.

00:40:45.970 --> 00:40:49.860 align:middle line:84%
They transmit forever because
they have active telomerase.

00:40:49.860 --> 00:40:53.400 align:middle line:84%
So you know, it's really
funny how everyone just said,

00:40:53.400 --> 00:40:54.450 align:middle line:90%
oh, Carrel's right.

00:40:54.450 --> 00:40:56.230 align:middle line:84%
All cells are always
immortal, which

00:40:56.230 --> 00:40:58.355 align:middle line:84%
if you do a thought
experiment, doesn't make sense.

00:40:58.355 --> 00:41:00.970 align:middle line:84%
If all cells were all immortal
and they're always dividing,

00:41:00.970 --> 00:41:04.660 align:middle line:84%
we would become giant blobs
very quickly, unsustainable.

00:41:04.660 --> 00:41:09.110 align:middle line:84%
So the system is set up for
us that we have very rare stem

00:41:09.110 --> 00:41:10.737 align:middle line:90%
cells, one in millions.

00:41:10.737 --> 00:41:12.820 align:middle line:84%
And then all the rest of
them are little daughters

00:41:12.820 --> 00:41:14.380 align:middle line:90%
which have a finite lifespan.

00:41:14.380 --> 00:41:16.150 align:middle line:90%
So it's a very elegant system.

00:41:16.150 --> 00:41:18.270 align:middle line:84%
Now, in some invertebrates
and other species where

00:41:18.270 --> 00:41:20.940 align:middle line:84%
they have telomerase activity
in a lot of cells, a lot of them

00:41:20.940 --> 00:41:23.000 align:middle line:84%
are stem-like, they're
actually immortal.

00:41:23.000 --> 00:41:25.070 align:middle line:84%
And that's how you
get like a squid

00:41:25.070 --> 00:41:28.370 align:middle line:84%
the size of a Jules
Verne submarine

00:41:28.370 --> 00:41:31.190 align:middle line:84%
or lobsters that just
molt until the Red Lobster

00:41:31.190 --> 00:41:32.590 align:middle line:90%
guy catches them.

00:41:32.590 --> 00:41:34.460 align:middle line:90%
They just grow.

00:41:34.460 --> 00:41:37.350 align:middle line:84%
But so far, I think we
can work with our system

00:41:37.350 --> 00:41:40.280 align:middle line:84%
to stay much more long and
sustainable without getting

00:41:40.280 --> 00:41:41.590 align:middle line:90%
physically larger.

00:41:41.590 --> 00:41:46.110 align:middle line:84%
But we just do better
maintenance with our ecology,

00:41:46.110 --> 00:41:49.640 align:middle line:84%
clean up the bad stem cells,
preserve the good ones.

00:41:49.640 --> 00:41:51.910 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: I talked a little
bit-- you mentioned cancer

00:41:51.910 --> 00:41:53.760 align:middle line:84%
again a moment ago--
with Bill Andrews

00:41:53.760 --> 00:41:55.970 align:middle line:84%
in the other conversation
about the notion there

00:41:55.970 --> 00:42:00.860 align:middle line:84%
was some thought that maybe
lengthening telomeres could

00:42:00.860 --> 00:42:01.910 align:middle line:90%
cause cancer.

00:42:01.910 --> 00:42:05.030 align:middle line:84%
And I guess it's come around now
to the studies are showing, no,

00:42:05.030 --> 00:42:06.800 align:middle line:84%
that does not appear
to be the case.

00:42:06.800 --> 00:42:09.420 align:middle line:84%
And you say also it's
clear to understand

00:42:09.420 --> 00:42:13.010 align:middle line:90%
that cancer is not hereditary.

00:42:13.010 --> 00:42:14.250 align:middle line:90%
Is that correct?

00:42:14.250 --> 00:42:17.040 align:middle line:84%
>>PARK: Well, it means known
fact-- epidemiologically

00:42:17.040 --> 00:42:18.970 align:middle line:84%
that the majority
of cases, there's

00:42:18.970 --> 00:42:22.420 align:middle line:84%
no pre-existing family
history that we would consider

00:42:22.420 --> 00:42:26.960 align:middle line:84%
causative, like the BRCA gene,
like the "bracka" gene, you

00:42:26.960 --> 00:42:32.690 align:middle line:84%
know, that accounts for a very
small, probably less than 10%

00:42:32.690 --> 00:42:34.100 align:middle line:90%
of all the breast cancers.

00:42:34.100 --> 00:42:35.797 align:middle line:84%
And ironically, the
breast cancer genes

00:42:35.797 --> 00:42:36.880 align:middle line:90%
are actually the opposite.

00:42:36.880 --> 00:42:40.515 align:middle line:84%
They're actually genes
responsible for helping

00:42:40.515 --> 00:42:43.660 align:middle line:84%
the cell recognize its own
damage and die, actually.

00:42:43.660 --> 00:42:51.500 align:middle line:84%
And so when you have one
good copy of a BRCA gene

00:42:51.500 --> 00:42:53.190 align:middle line:84%
and you lose it
in that stem cell,

00:42:53.190 --> 00:42:56.240 align:middle line:84%
then you have no good copies
and then you have a problem.

00:42:56.240 --> 00:42:59.810 align:middle line:84%
You have poor self-regulation
of that stem cell.

00:42:59.810 --> 00:43:03.030 align:middle line:84%
But the fundamental question
is, does telomerase activation

00:43:03.030 --> 00:43:04.440 align:middle line:90%
cause cancer?

00:43:04.440 --> 00:43:07.110 align:middle line:84%
And experimentally,
it doesn't appear

00:43:07.110 --> 00:43:10.650 align:middle line:84%
to be-- that doesn't
appear to be the case.

00:43:10.650 --> 00:43:14.610 align:middle line:84%
Because 85% of tumors
do express telomerase,

00:43:14.610 --> 00:43:16.820 align:middle line:84%
people naturally
are fearful of that.

00:43:16.820 --> 00:43:19.940 align:middle line:84%
But I believe it's the
telomerase activity

00:43:19.940 --> 00:43:21.910 align:middle line:90%
is maintained.

00:43:21.910 --> 00:43:23.680 align:middle line:84%
So instead of being
a Jimmy Olsen,

00:43:23.680 --> 00:43:26.120 align:middle line:84%
like a regular, run of
the mill cub reporter,

00:43:26.120 --> 00:43:28.090 align:middle line:90%
it's already a Clark Kent cell.

00:43:28.090 --> 00:43:31.270 align:middle line:84%
So it's reached orthodoxy
that most people,

00:43:31.270 --> 00:43:34.160 align:middle line:84%
or a lot of
scientists, maybe 51%,

00:43:34.160 --> 00:43:36.830 align:middle line:84%
think that cancer usually
is a stem cell disease.

00:43:36.830 --> 00:43:39.150 align:middle line:84%
It's not a run of
the mill disease,

00:43:39.150 --> 00:43:42.249 align:middle line:84%
so it's just a retained
ability of that stem cell.

00:43:42.249 --> 00:43:43.040 align:middle line:90%
And it makes sense.

00:43:43.040 --> 00:43:46.160 align:middle line:84%
You take an already immortal
superhero cell, you mess it up.

00:43:46.160 --> 00:43:47.960 align:middle line:90%
It maintains its immortality.

00:43:47.960 --> 00:43:51.410 align:middle line:84%
You don't take a Jimmy Olsen
cell and then turn on things.

00:43:51.410 --> 00:43:53.400 align:middle line:84%
It's already damaged
and dysfunctional,

00:43:53.400 --> 00:43:55.730 align:middle line:90%
30 generations old.

00:43:55.730 --> 00:43:57.200 align:middle line:90%
There are exceptions.

00:43:57.200 --> 00:43:59.730 align:middle line:84%
But in general, I
believe that cancer

00:43:59.730 --> 00:44:03.310 align:middle line:84%
is a disease of stem cells,
so the telomerase activity is

00:44:03.310 --> 00:44:05.380 align:middle line:90%
a retained property of that.

00:44:05.380 --> 00:44:05.930 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: OK.

00:44:05.930 --> 00:44:07.638 align:middle line:84%
Thank you for making
the differentiation.

00:44:07.638 --> 00:44:10.930 align:middle line:84%
Now, we're getting to the part
we're going to talk about some

00:44:10.930 --> 00:44:13.420 align:middle line:84%
of the even products that
are out there on the market

00:44:13.420 --> 00:44:16.190 align:middle line:84%
and some other
ways we can manage

00:44:16.190 --> 00:44:21.450 align:middle line:84%
this rebuilding of telomerase
on the end of our chromosomes.

00:44:21.450 --> 00:44:24.330 align:middle line:84%
But let's talk about the
test, because you said to me

00:44:24.330 --> 00:44:26.900 align:middle line:84%
off-camera, you say, the
best thing we have to use,

00:44:26.900 --> 00:44:28.290 align:middle line:84%
there are these
telomerase tests.

00:44:28.290 --> 00:44:29.872 align:middle line:90%
But they're not reliable.

00:44:29.872 --> 00:44:31.580 align:middle line:84%
It's both, but it's
the best we have now.

00:44:31.580 --> 00:44:34.500 align:middle line:84%
Can you talk about
those telomerase tests?

00:44:34.500 --> 00:44:36.190 align:middle line:84%
>>PARK: Well, you
know, I didn't mean

00:44:36.190 --> 00:44:37.398 align:middle line:90%
to say they weren't reliable.

00:44:37.398 --> 00:44:38.590 align:middle line:90%
They're reproducible.

00:44:38.590 --> 00:44:41.454 align:middle line:84%
But they've been going
through constant improvement.

00:44:41.454 --> 00:44:42.870 align:middle line:84%
But the problem
is-- and you know,

00:44:42.870 --> 00:44:45.520 align:middle line:84%
I've talked to the owners and
scientists in these companies,

00:44:45.520 --> 00:44:47.770 align:middle line:84%
there's maybe five
or six companies.

00:44:47.770 --> 00:44:49.265 align:middle line:90%
They all disagree.

00:44:49.265 --> 00:44:51.640 align:middle line:84%
The only thing they can agree
on is that the other people

00:44:51.640 --> 00:44:52.710 align:middle line:90%
are wrong, right?

00:44:52.710 --> 00:44:56.210 align:middle line:84%
So they use different tests,
different body fluids.

00:44:56.210 --> 00:44:58.850 align:middle line:84%
And when you talk
about predicting

00:44:58.850 --> 00:45:01.390 align:middle line:84%
someone's age or their
life expectancy based

00:45:01.390 --> 00:45:04.395 align:middle line:84%
on telomere length,
that's a nonstarter.

00:45:04.395 --> 00:45:06.270 align:middle line:84%
And that was something
that got a lot of buzz

00:45:06.270 --> 00:45:07.970 align:middle line:90%
in the press a couple years ago.

00:45:07.970 --> 00:45:09.470 align:middle line:84%
If there was a test
now to tell you

00:45:09.470 --> 00:45:11.990 align:middle line:84%
how long you're going to
live, would you take it?

00:45:11.990 --> 00:45:14.370 align:middle line:90%
It's totally false.

00:45:14.370 --> 00:45:16.357 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: But what
is the value in them?

00:45:16.357 --> 00:45:17.940 align:middle line:84%
>>PARK: I think it's
a good benchmark.

00:45:17.940 --> 00:45:20.190 align:middle line:84%
I mean, it's kind of like a
snapshot of where you are.

00:45:20.190 --> 00:45:21.950 align:middle line:84%
And in the future,
we'll have the ability

00:45:21.950 --> 00:45:25.070 align:middle line:90%
to understand how that changes.

00:45:25.070 --> 00:45:27.460 align:middle line:84%
But ideally, we should
be able to measure

00:45:27.460 --> 00:45:31.030 align:middle line:84%
not the telomere length
but the damage of what's

00:45:31.030 --> 00:45:32.170 align:middle line:90%
in between the telomeres.

00:45:32.170 --> 00:45:34.019 align:middle line:84%
So ideally, what
you want is to be

00:45:34.019 --> 00:45:36.060 align:middle line:84%
able to measure not just
the length of telomeres,

00:45:36.060 --> 00:45:39.454 align:middle line:84%
like how much wick is left
on the candle or firecracker.

00:45:39.454 --> 00:45:41.120 align:middle line:84%
What you want to know
is how much damage

00:45:41.120 --> 00:45:43.260 align:middle line:90%
has gone on in the chromosome.

00:45:43.260 --> 00:45:46.370 align:middle line:84%
And so we'll have the
ability to wave a tricorder

00:45:46.370 --> 00:45:50.420 align:middle line:84%
and say, oh, your brain
has 30% of its stem

00:45:50.420 --> 00:45:56.010 align:middle line:84%
cells are significantly damaged,
or your heart is 60% damaged.

00:45:56.010 --> 00:45:58.810 align:middle line:84%
Right now, we can measure how
much critical shortening there

00:45:58.810 --> 00:46:01.430 align:middle line:84%
is on the telomere ends,
which is very helpful.

00:46:01.430 --> 00:46:04.920 align:middle line:84%
So within the context of one
patient that I'm caring for,

00:46:04.920 --> 00:46:08.290 align:middle line:84%
to have that snapshot and
to follow it is very useful.

00:46:08.290 --> 00:46:11.509 align:middle line:84%
But you can't tell people, well,
you have 18 1/2 years to live.

00:46:11.509 --> 00:46:12.175 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:46:12.175 --> 00:46:12.716 align:middle line:90%
>>PARK: Yeah.

00:46:12.716 --> 00:46:13.700 align:middle line:90%
It's just nonsense.

00:46:13.700 --> 00:46:14.720 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: OK.

00:46:14.720 --> 00:46:19.530 align:middle line:84%
So let's talk about TA-65, which
is the product you were talking

00:46:19.530 --> 00:46:21.950 align:middle line:84%
about that you were
given license to sell

00:46:21.950 --> 00:46:25.530 align:middle line:84%
and that you still deal
with, and what TA-65

00:46:25.530 --> 00:46:30.530 align:middle line:84%
is and also the active
ingredient in it, and so forth.

00:46:30.530 --> 00:46:35.030 align:middle line:84%
>>PARK: So TA-65 is a
proprietary molecule

00:46:35.030 --> 00:46:38.470 align:middle line:84%
that was discovered--
it's an extract

00:46:38.470 --> 00:46:42.490 align:middle line:84%
from a Chinese longevity
herb called astragalus.

00:46:42.490 --> 00:46:45.240 align:middle line:84%
Now the identity of the
molecule is not known,

00:46:45.240 --> 00:46:47.510 align:middle line:90%
nor has it been divulged to me.

00:46:47.510 --> 00:46:50.950 align:middle line:84%
There's widespread
speculation on that topic.

00:46:50.950 --> 00:46:54.242 align:middle line:84%
Within this country, they
were awarded, Geron that is,

00:46:54.242 --> 00:46:55.200 align:middle line:90%
and that subsequently--

00:46:55.200 --> 00:46:56.366 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Geron Corporation?

00:46:56.366 --> 00:46:59.840 align:middle line:84%
>>PARK: Geron Corporation
was subsequently

00:46:59.840 --> 00:47:04.880 align:middle line:84%
sold to TA Sciences, so TA-65
is the proprietary version

00:47:04.880 --> 00:47:07.680 align:middle line:84%
of this unknown extract
of the astragalus plant.

00:47:07.680 --> 00:47:11.619 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Some active, one of
the active chemicals in it.

00:47:11.619 --> 00:47:12.160 align:middle line:90%
>>PARK: Yeah.

00:47:12.160 --> 00:47:13.860 align:middle line:84%
It's a molecule that
naturally occurs

00:47:13.860 --> 00:47:16.700 align:middle line:84%
in this longevity herb
which has been known

00:47:16.700 --> 00:47:18.450 align:middle line:84%
for thousands of years
in Chinese medicine

00:47:18.450 --> 00:47:20.320 align:middle line:90%
to be a chi tonifier.

00:47:20.320 --> 00:47:23.030 align:middle line:84%
And it's in the
heaven class of herbs,

00:47:23.030 --> 00:47:27.470 align:middle line:84%
which means it increases your
chi or your prana, your life

00:47:27.470 --> 00:47:27.970 align:middle line:90%
force.

00:47:27.970 --> 00:47:30.610 align:middle line:84%
And it was used for
longevity and immunity, which

00:47:30.610 --> 00:47:33.720 align:middle line:84%
now jives with this
modern science,

00:47:33.720 --> 00:47:37.640 align:middle line:84%
because we know that thymic
aging, immune aging is

00:47:37.640 --> 00:47:41.010 align:middle line:90%
part and parcel of why we age.

00:47:41.010 --> 00:47:43.361 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And astragalus
is pretty well accepted.

00:47:43.361 --> 00:47:43.902 align:middle line:90%
>>PARK: Yeah.

00:47:43.902 --> 00:47:44.320 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:47:44.320 --> 00:47:45.700 align:middle line:90%
But this is not astragalus root.

00:47:45.700 --> 00:47:47.470 align:middle line:84%
This is just the
purified, like pure--

00:47:47.470 --> 00:47:48.178 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: I know.

00:47:48.178 --> 00:47:48.840 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

00:47:48.840 --> 00:47:51.006 align:middle line:84%
So I was going to say, the
next question people say,

00:47:51.006 --> 00:47:52.740 align:middle line:90%
oh, I take astragalus.

00:47:52.740 --> 00:47:53.890 align:middle line:90%
So?

00:47:53.890 --> 00:47:57.030 align:middle line:84%
>>PARK: Well, it would be the
difference between Taxol, which

00:47:57.030 --> 00:48:00.880 align:middle line:84%
is from the Pacific yew tree,
and that one molecule which

00:48:00.880 --> 00:48:03.340 align:middle line:84%
is extracted for
pharmaceutical use.

00:48:03.340 --> 00:48:05.865 align:middle line:84%
And that is a
microtubule inhibitor.

00:48:05.865 --> 00:48:07.430 align:middle line:90%
It inhibits the aggregation.

00:48:07.430 --> 00:48:09.820 align:middle line:84%
And that's why it's
a great cancer drug.

00:48:09.820 --> 00:48:14.640 align:middle line:84%
It keeps rapidly dividing
cells from rapidly dividing.

00:48:14.640 --> 00:48:17.120 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So among
this, I would like

00:48:17.120 --> 00:48:19.590 align:middle line:84%
to get-- I wouldn't
mind you at this point

00:48:19.590 --> 00:48:22.590 align:middle line:84%
just kind of give us some
ideas of some startling sort

00:48:22.590 --> 00:48:28.760 align:middle line:84%
of responses, some maybe
beyond the average response

00:48:28.760 --> 00:48:33.240 align:middle line:84%
that a person would have to
the astragalus compound you're

00:48:33.240 --> 00:48:34.800 align:middle line:90%
talking about in TA-65.

00:48:34.800 --> 00:48:37.030 align:middle line:84%
What kind of results
have some people gotten?

00:48:37.030 --> 00:48:39.390 align:middle line:84%
And then who's-- what
happens on the other end,

00:48:39.390 --> 00:48:40.946 align:middle line:90%
where nothing happens?

00:48:40.946 --> 00:48:42.570 align:middle line:84%
>>PARK: Well, I have
to just, you know,

00:48:42.570 --> 00:48:45.360 align:middle line:84%
put a massive disclaimer
out right here.

00:48:45.360 --> 00:48:46.200 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes, do.

00:48:46.200 --> 00:48:48.435 align:middle line:84%
>>PARK: These statements have
not been approved by the FDA.

00:48:48.435 --> 00:48:49.018 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:48:49.018 --> 00:48:53.390 align:middle line:84%
>>PARK: TA-65 is not approved
for treatment of any disease.

00:48:53.390 --> 00:48:54.577 align:middle line:90%
Read it right here.

00:48:54.577 --> 00:48:56.160 align:middle line:84%
But you know, it's
all just anecdotal.

00:48:56.160 --> 00:48:56.740 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:48:56.740 --> 00:48:57.090 align:middle line:90%
>>PARK: But it's interesting.

00:48:57.090 --> 00:48:59.415 align:middle line:84%
You can't really predict
how a person will react.

00:48:59.415 --> 00:49:02.990 align:middle line:84%
There are only a few
constants or truisms.

00:49:02.990 --> 00:49:07.640 align:middle line:84%
It seems to have a very profound
effect on most people's sleep.

00:49:07.640 --> 00:49:11.680 align:middle line:84%
And so they sleep deeper,
often with more abrupt brief

00:49:11.680 --> 00:49:14.860 align:middle line:84%
interruption or
brief awakenings.

00:49:14.860 --> 00:49:17.300 align:middle line:84%
Their dreams tend to be
vivid, if they dream.

00:49:17.300 --> 00:49:19.070 align:middle line:84%
Now, one of the most
intriguing things

00:49:19.070 --> 00:49:20.550 align:middle line:84%
is older people
who haven't dreamt

00:49:20.550 --> 00:49:23.570 align:middle line:84%
for decades can sometimes
recover dream function, which

00:49:23.570 --> 00:49:29.090 align:middle line:84%
to me functionally implies some
kind of anatomic improvement,

00:49:29.090 --> 00:49:30.590 align:middle line:90%
rewiring, which is great.

00:49:30.590 --> 00:49:33.050 align:middle line:84%
I mean another of the
dogmas that we were handed

00:49:33.050 --> 00:49:36.470 align:middle line:84%
in med school was that you don't
make new brain cells, which

00:49:36.470 --> 00:49:37.220 align:middle line:90%
you do, actually.

00:49:37.220 --> 00:49:39.140 align:middle line:84%
You make about 10,000
new brain cells a night.

00:49:39.140 --> 00:49:41.160 align:middle line:84%
And that's what dreaming
and neurogenesis is,

00:49:41.160 --> 00:49:44.570 align:middle line:84%
so there's a tremendous
neuroplasticity.

00:49:44.570 --> 00:49:46.970 align:middle line:84%
Anecdotally, some people
report improvements

00:49:46.970 --> 00:49:50.840 align:middle line:84%
in their glycemic control
or their blood sugars.

00:49:50.840 --> 00:49:52.340 align:middle line:90%
So that's nice.

00:49:52.340 --> 00:49:54.570 align:middle line:84%
Most people have
better exercise,

00:49:54.570 --> 00:49:56.760 align:middle line:84%
and recovery
especially, which stands

00:49:56.760 --> 00:50:01.240 align:middle line:84%
to reason, because your cells as
they're damaged need to repair.

00:50:01.240 --> 00:50:03.030 align:middle line:84%
And a lot of that
is just massive

00:50:03.030 --> 00:50:05.367 align:middle line:84%
stem cell action, just
pumping out new muscle.

00:50:05.367 --> 00:50:07.200 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Using a lot
of energy in the body.

00:50:07.200 --> 00:50:07.741 align:middle line:90%
>>PARK: Yeah.

00:50:07.741 --> 00:50:08.620 align:middle line:90%
So that's exciting.

00:50:08.620 --> 00:50:13.090 align:middle line:84%
But again, it's a panacea
and it's a placebo,

00:50:13.090 --> 00:50:15.050 align:middle line:84%
but without the
pejorative connotation.

00:50:15.050 --> 00:50:18.189 align:middle line:84%
It really works differently,
adaptogenically with everyone.

00:50:18.189 --> 00:50:20.605 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Are there some people
who have no response to it

00:50:20.605 --> 00:50:21.981 align:middle line:84%
at all, no
recognizable response?

00:50:21.981 --> 00:50:22.980 align:middle line:90%
>>PARK: Certainly, yeah.

00:50:22.980 --> 00:50:23.680 align:middle line:90%
It's rare.

00:50:23.680 --> 00:50:25.490 align:middle line:90%
I would say 1 in 10.

00:50:25.490 --> 00:50:28.780 align:middle line:84%
A lot of it has to with
absorption, attribution.

00:50:28.780 --> 00:50:32.890 align:middle line:84%
Some people just are not
attuned to their bodies.

00:50:32.890 --> 00:50:33.510 align:middle line:90%
But it's rare.

00:50:33.510 --> 00:50:37.050 align:middle line:84%
And that's what distinguishes
it from other classes

00:50:37.050 --> 00:50:39.360 align:middle line:84%
of neutroceuticals or
things that people take.

00:50:39.360 --> 00:50:41.820 align:middle line:84%
A lot of times people
go weeks and months

00:50:41.820 --> 00:50:44.070 align:middle line:84%
and are not really sure,
but they think it's working.

00:50:44.070 --> 00:50:47.450 align:middle line:84%
But this has a pretty profound
effect from the first night,

00:50:47.450 --> 00:50:48.840 align:middle line:90%
which is nice.

00:50:48.840 --> 00:50:51.860 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And what about the
whole notion that again, there

00:50:51.860 --> 00:50:55.760 align:middle line:84%
are many different elements
of keeping our being youthful,

00:50:55.760 --> 00:51:00.490 align:middle line:84%
having to do with diet,
exercise, getting proper sleep,

00:51:00.490 --> 00:51:01.680 align:middle line:90%
meditation, and all that.

00:51:01.680 --> 00:51:05.514 align:middle line:84%
Where does that factor
in in your world?

00:51:05.514 --> 00:51:07.180 align:middle line:84%
>>PARK: You know, I'm
grateful for Gaiam

00:51:07.180 --> 00:51:09.910 align:middle line:84%
because I'm learning more
about that, actually.

00:51:09.910 --> 00:51:11.390 align:middle line:90%
We have open minds.

00:51:11.390 --> 00:51:15.700 align:middle line:84%
I guess it's like the
name of your show is that.

00:51:15.700 --> 00:51:20.120 align:middle line:84%
When we came through med
school, the general thing

00:51:20.120 --> 00:51:24.200 align:middle line:84%
was alternative
complementary was a tagline

00:51:24.200 --> 00:51:26.820 align:middle line:84%
or sort of like a
metaphor for quackery,

00:51:26.820 --> 00:51:27.820 align:middle line:90%
stuff that doesn't work.

00:51:27.820 --> 00:51:30.620 align:middle line:90%
But I think that it's all good.

00:51:30.620 --> 00:51:33.070 align:middle line:84%
You know, a study came
out in Huffington Post,

00:51:33.070 --> 00:51:35.440 align:middle line:84%
well, the studies don't
come out in Huffington Post,

00:51:35.440 --> 00:51:39.010 align:middle line:84%
but they're talking about
huge analysis of thousands

00:51:39.010 --> 00:51:41.760 align:middle line:84%
of people, their telomeres,
and they related it back

00:51:41.760 --> 00:51:43.160 align:middle line:90%
to the Mediterranean diet.

00:51:43.160 --> 00:51:46.064 align:middle line:84%
And the public loves this, oh,
red wine, Mediterranean diet.

00:51:46.064 --> 00:51:47.230 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Lots of olive oil.

00:51:47.230 --> 00:51:50.390 align:middle line:84%
>>PARK: French-- but it's
just a simplification.

00:51:50.390 --> 00:51:52.510 align:middle line:84%
But yeah, it's all
true on some level.

00:51:52.510 --> 00:51:58.090 align:middle line:84%
So obviously, and it happens
to be true, if you eat well,

00:51:58.090 --> 00:52:01.430 align:middle line:84%
if you meditate, exercise,
think good thoughts,

00:52:01.430 --> 00:52:06.240 align:middle line:84%
you're going to get better
functionally on every level.

00:52:06.240 --> 00:52:08.720 align:middle line:84%
And if you do the opposite,
if you don't eat well

00:52:08.720 --> 00:52:12.410 align:middle line:84%
and you perseverate
on nasty thoughts

00:52:12.410 --> 00:52:15.590 align:middle line:84%
and you live in
fear and bad sleep,

00:52:15.590 --> 00:52:17.220 align:middle line:84%
you're going to
get sicker faster.

00:52:17.220 --> 00:52:20.490 align:middle line:84%
So I've come to realize
that it's all about just

00:52:20.490 --> 00:52:23.930 align:middle line:84%
the flow of whatever
it is that's flowing,

00:52:23.930 --> 00:52:27.200 align:middle line:84%
consciousness, life
energy, microtubules.

00:52:27.200 --> 00:52:30.530 align:middle line:84%
But when things are blocked and
you fixate and it's not flowing

00:52:30.530 --> 00:52:33.490 align:middle line:84%
and it's not integrated and
balanced, people get stuck.

00:52:33.490 --> 00:52:35.840 align:middle line:84%
So it sounds crazy,
but people who

00:52:35.840 --> 00:52:37.950 align:middle line:84%
are unable to
express themselves,

00:52:37.950 --> 00:52:40.030 align:middle line:84%
maybe they'll get
thyroid or throat cancer.

00:52:40.030 --> 00:52:42.404 align:middle line:84%
Or people who are worried
about their kids, maybe they'll

00:52:42.404 --> 00:52:43.410 align:middle line:90%
get breast cancer.

00:52:43.410 --> 00:52:44.110 align:middle line:90%
I don't know.

00:52:44.110 --> 00:52:45.930 align:middle line:90%
It's just all kind of crazy.

00:52:45.930 --> 00:52:48.315 align:middle line:84%
But I'm just learning
more and more about this,

00:52:48.315 --> 00:52:49.316 align:middle line:90%
so I'm very interested--

00:52:49.316 --> 00:52:51.065 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Well, one
thing did I ask about,

00:52:51.065 --> 00:52:52.610 align:middle line:84%
and I think it was
Bill Andrews, not

00:52:52.610 --> 00:52:56.590 align:middle line:84%
Terry Grossman who validated
that was that anything you

00:52:56.590 --> 00:52:58.720 align:middle line:84%
do that is creating
extraordinarily

00:52:58.720 --> 00:53:01.530 align:middle line:84%
high levels of cortisol
production in the body

00:53:01.530 --> 00:53:04.057 align:middle line:84%
has the effect of shortening
the length of the telomeres.

00:53:04.057 --> 00:53:05.390 align:middle line:90%
>>PARK: Oh, there's no question.

00:53:05.390 --> 00:53:07.473 align:middle line:84%
And that's the fun thing
about integrating science

00:53:07.473 --> 00:53:08.990 align:middle line:90%
into holistic medicine.

00:53:08.990 --> 00:53:13.090 align:middle line:84%
When you look at T-cells
bathed in cortisol,

00:53:13.090 --> 00:53:14.930 align:middle line:84%
their telomerase
activity is nonexistent

00:53:14.930 --> 00:53:16.805 align:middle line:84%
which fits in the whole
function of cortisol.

00:53:16.805 --> 00:53:18.346 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And we're
cortisol junkies.

00:53:18.346 --> 00:53:20.849 align:middle line:84%
We're adrenaline junkies
now, in the Western world.

00:53:20.849 --> 00:53:21.390 align:middle line:90%
>>PARK: Yeah.

00:53:21.390 --> 00:53:23.340 align:middle line:84%
But it all has to do
with integration, right?

00:53:23.340 --> 00:53:28.200 align:middle line:84%
So if people are constantly
bathed in stress hormone,

00:53:28.200 --> 00:53:31.930 align:middle line:84%
then there are two--
what's the word?

00:53:31.930 --> 00:53:34.987 align:middle line:84%
Yin and yang, they're in this
state of yang activity, right?

00:53:34.987 --> 00:53:35.570 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:53:35.570 --> 00:53:37.620 align:middle line:84%
>>PARK: They're constantly
out there tearing it up.

00:53:37.620 --> 00:53:39.050 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: It's a
destructive force.

00:53:39.050 --> 00:53:40.925 align:middle line:84%
>>PARK: So I think there
needs to be balance.

00:53:40.925 --> 00:53:43.072 align:middle line:84%
I mean, all the symbols
around here describe

00:53:43.072 --> 00:53:45.280 align:middle line:84%
an attitude, which people
are starting to accept now,

00:53:45.280 --> 00:53:46.390 align:middle line:90%
that you need balance.

00:53:46.390 --> 00:53:48.030 align:middle line:90%
Sleep is not wasted time.

00:53:48.030 --> 00:53:51.530 align:middle line:84%
It's the time when your body's
most actively reconstructing

00:53:51.530 --> 00:53:52.450 align:middle line:90%
itself.

00:53:52.450 --> 00:53:53.697 align:middle line:90%
All the cells are copying.

00:53:53.697 --> 00:53:54.530 align:middle line:90%
They're rebalancing.

00:53:54.530 --> 00:53:55.720 align:middle line:90%
You're re-learning.

00:53:55.720 --> 00:53:58.560 align:middle line:84%
So you need that sort of
yin phase, the restoration.

00:53:58.560 --> 00:54:01.030 align:middle line:90%
You can't always be on the go.

00:54:01.030 --> 00:54:02.280 align:middle line:90%
And so it's all about balance.

00:54:02.280 --> 00:54:03.863 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And maybe
that's really more

00:54:03.863 --> 00:54:06.260 align:middle line:84%
what the Mediterranean
diet study was indicating,

00:54:06.260 --> 00:54:09.220 align:middle line:84%
was that you have people maybe
that are living a slightly more

00:54:09.220 --> 00:54:13.890 align:middle line:84%
in balance life, I mean, family,
a glass of wine, mom, grandma

00:54:13.890 --> 00:54:15.820 align:middle line:84%
still cook together
in some cases.

00:54:15.820 --> 00:54:18.680 align:middle line:84%
And you're leading a life
that is maybe a little lower

00:54:18.680 --> 00:54:21.249 align:middle line:84%
on the stress scale,
and that's why.

00:54:21.249 --> 00:54:22.040 align:middle line:90%
>>PARK: Absolutely.

00:54:22.040 --> 00:54:24.165 align:middle line:84%
Well, you know, maybe you're
a Greek civil servant.

00:54:24.165 --> 00:54:26.397 align:middle line:90%
You don't have a job to go to.

00:54:26.397 --> 00:54:27.980 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Yeah,
there's also that too.

00:54:27.980 --> 00:54:28.360 align:middle line:90%
>>PARK: Too soon?

00:54:28.360 --> 00:54:29.950 align:middle line:84%
You're just throwing
back the ouzo

00:54:29.950 --> 00:54:32.220 align:middle line:84%
and checking out the donkeys

00:54:32.220 --> 00:54:32.970 align:middle line:90%
I don't know.

00:54:32.970 --> 00:54:34.160 align:middle line:90%
Who knows?

00:54:34.160 --> 00:54:36.450 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Well, I have
to say-- after we talked,

00:54:36.450 --> 00:54:40.090 align:middle line:84%
and I read your book, which
every third page is dog-eared,

00:54:40.090 --> 00:54:41.930 align:middle line:90%
I found it really interesting.

00:54:41.930 --> 00:54:43.890 align:middle line:84%
I find all these
sciences interesting.

00:54:43.890 --> 00:54:45.432 align:middle line:90%
And I said, you know what?

00:54:45.432 --> 00:54:47.390 align:middle line:84%
Before the interview, I
want to take it and see

00:54:47.390 --> 00:54:49.530 align:middle line:84%
if I see anything,
because I'll always,

00:54:49.530 --> 00:54:51.160 align:middle line:84%
as long as it seems
relatively safe,

00:54:51.160 --> 00:54:53.335 align:middle line:84%
try something new in
prep for an interview

00:54:53.335 --> 00:54:55.450 align:middle line:90%
or because of an interviewee.

00:54:55.450 --> 00:54:58.160 align:middle line:84%
And I do have to say--
I mean, the caveat

00:54:58.160 --> 00:54:59.140 align:middle line:90%
is we're all different.

00:54:59.140 --> 00:55:02.030 align:middle line:84%
One thing I've learned, no
two bodies, minds, thumbprints

00:55:02.030 --> 00:55:02.780 align:middle line:90%
are alike.

00:55:02.780 --> 00:55:06.090 align:middle line:84%
But for my body, without
really expecting anything

00:55:06.090 --> 00:55:08.200 align:middle line:84%
to happen in that
short a time, I

00:55:08.200 --> 00:55:11.680 align:middle line:84%
noticed the sleep
thing, much deeper.

00:55:11.680 --> 00:55:14.280 align:middle line:84%
And I noticed going back
into really deep sleep.

00:55:14.280 --> 00:55:16.860 align:middle line:84%
And you're right, even
more active dreaming time.

00:55:16.860 --> 00:55:18.720 align:middle line:90%
So that was my experience of it.

00:55:18.720 --> 00:55:20.470 align:middle line:84%
>>PARK: Which is
interesting, because I've

00:55:20.470 --> 00:55:24.110 align:middle line:84%
had people stop taking
things like adaptogens

00:55:24.110 --> 00:55:25.620 align:middle line:90%
because they had nightmares.

00:55:25.620 --> 00:55:27.950 align:middle line:84%
So the question is,
is the nightmare

00:55:27.950 --> 00:55:31.090 align:middle line:90%
a side effect of the adaptogen?

00:55:31.090 --> 00:55:31.590 align:middle line:90%
No.

00:55:31.590 --> 00:55:31.970 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Interesting.

00:55:31.970 --> 00:55:33.570 align:middle line:84%
>>PARK: The nightmare
is because you

00:55:33.570 --> 00:55:36.640 align:middle line:84%
went to sleep thinking about
all the things you don't have

00:55:36.640 --> 00:55:38.807 align:middle line:84%
and the things that are
hurting you and chasing you.

00:55:38.807 --> 00:55:40.431 align:middle line:84%
So it's like you go
into the multiplex,

00:55:40.431 --> 00:55:42.430 align:middle line:84%
you go into where the
horror film is showing,

00:55:42.430 --> 00:55:45.320 align:middle line:90%
not where the rom com is.

00:55:45.320 --> 00:55:47.910 align:middle line:84%
So you really do need
to set the agenda

00:55:47.910 --> 00:55:49.660 align:middle line:84%
before you go to
sleep of gratitude,

00:55:49.660 --> 00:55:50.910 align:middle line:90%
even if you're not feeling it.

00:55:50.910 --> 00:55:51.570 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Especially if
you're going to be activating

00:55:51.570 --> 00:55:52.385 align:middle line:90%

00:55:54.280 --> 00:55:56.120 align:middle line:84%
I mean, I'm lucky I
don't have nightmares.

00:55:56.120 --> 00:55:58.720 align:middle line:84%
But I have had some kind of
revelatory dreams, even about

00:55:58.720 --> 00:56:00.530 align:middle line:84%
friends, where I'll
say, hey, just woke up

00:56:00.530 --> 00:56:01.530 align:middle line:90%
having this dream about you.

00:56:01.530 --> 00:56:03.071 align:middle line:84%
Just wanted to give

00:56:03.071 --> 00:56:05.450 align:middle line:84%
>>PARK: Oh, your mind is
a very powerful thing.

00:56:05.450 --> 00:56:08.375 align:middle line:84%
So if you go to sleep
angry at your spouse,

00:56:08.375 --> 00:56:10.800 align:middle line:84%
you're going to wake
up angrier, you know.

00:56:10.800 --> 00:56:14.640 align:middle line:84%
And likewise with

00:56:14.640 --> 00:56:19.090 align:middle line:84%

guess from "White Christmas,"

00:56:19.090 --> 00:56:21.657 align:middle line:84%
count your blessings instead

00:56:34.610 --> 00:56:38.340 align:middle line:84%
And I hope they'll take the
time to google it and learn

00:56:38.340 --> 00:56:39.410 align:middle line:90%
about telomeres.

00:56:39.410 --> 00:56:42.820 align:middle line:84%
And if they're interested, they
can learn more from my videos.

00:56:42.820 --> 00:56:47.180 align:middle line:84%
But you know, we're
not selling anything

00:56:47.180 --> 00:56:50.220 align:middle line:90%
that's snake oil or hokum.

00:56:50.220 --> 00:56:51.760 align:middle line:84%
My whole purpose
for being here is

00:56:51.760 --> 00:56:53.760 align:middle line:90%

00:56:55.200 --> 00:56:59.196 align:middle line:84%
very simple in align
with all basic science,

00:56:59.196 --> 00:57:01.570 align:middle line:84%
and I believe something that
people will come to realize,

00:57:01.570 --> 00:57:03.760 align:middle line:84%
which is that there
really is just one

disease with many faces.

be healthy, so people

00:57:10.180 --> 00:57:13.617 align:middle line:84%

they tell you what's right,

00:57:18.531 --> 00:57:20.280 align:middle line:84%
you're going to go to
that place where you

00:57:20.280 --> 00:57:22.280 align:middle line:90%
need to just obey and listen.

00:57:22.280 --> 00:57:24.220 align:middle line:90%
But people are very smart.

00:57:24.220 --> 00:57:27.510 align:middle line:84%
And they can intuit whether
someone's telling the truth.

00:57:27.510 --> 00:57:29.300 align:middle line:84%
And I would just
say, go with that,

00:57:29.300 --> 00:57:31.840 align:middle line:84%
because there's a lot of
hucksterism out there.

00:57:31.840 --> 00:57:35.426 align:middle line:84%
There's a lot of people
selling snake oil.

00:57:35.426 --> 00:57:37.800 align:middle line:84%
But, you know, even snake oil
can work if you believe it.

00:57:37.800 --> 00:57:39.200 align:middle line:90%
But it only goes so far.

00:57:39.200 --> 00:57:41.840 align:middle line:84%
What we're talking about
is a fundamental change

00:57:41.840 --> 00:57:44.739 align:middle line:84%
in how we think about
physiology and wellness

00:57:44.739 --> 00:57:45.780 align:middle line:90%
and how to maintain that.

00:57:45.780 --> 00:57:49.530 align:middle line:84%
And you can get there from
exercise, yoga, from Sudoku.

00:57:49.530 --> 00:57:52.950 align:middle line:10%
But trust how you can maintain
your own health and wellness

00:57:52.950 --> 00:57:56.590 align:middle line:10%
because once you embark down
the pathway of like, oh my god,

00:57:56.590 --> 00:57:58.610 align:middle line:10%
you have to listen to
all the authorities,

00:57:58.610 --> 00:58:00.035 align:middle line:10%
you can get led astray, I think.

00:58:00.035 --> 00:58:00.910 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Absolutely.

00:58:00.910 --> 00:58:01.840 align:middle line:90%
It's very confusing.

00:58:01.840 --> 00:58:03.450 align:middle line:84%
And again, no two
bodies are alike.

00:58:03.450 --> 00:58:06.200 align:middle line:84%
And this is an evolving
science, and you're

00:58:06.200 --> 00:58:08.140 align:middle line:84%
capturing it and
doing what you can

00:58:08.140 --> 00:58:11.409 align:middle line:84%
with that science in the
state it's in right now.

00:58:11.409 --> 00:58:11.950 align:middle line:90%
>>PARK: Yeah.

00:58:11.950 --> 00:58:12.866 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Pretty much.

00:58:12.866 --> 00:58:15.034 align:middle line:84%
>>PARK: Just throwing
it out there.

00:58:15.034 --> 00:58:16.200 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Thank you so much.

00:58:16.200 --> 00:58:16.318 align:middle line:90%
>>PARK: Sure.

00:58:16.318 --> 00:58:16.910 align:middle line:90%
Thank you so much.

00:58:16.910 --> 00:58:18.640 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: You speak very
eloquently on the subject.

00:58:18.640 --> 00:58:20.240 align:middle line:84%
I've really enjoyed
talking with you.

00:58:20.240 --> 00:58:20.864 align:middle line:90%
>>PARK: Thanks.

00:58:20.864 --> 00:58:22.970 align:middle line:10%
>>REGINA: So
meanwhile, for you, you

00:58:22.970 --> 00:58:25.160 align:middle line:10%
can go to telomeretimebomb.com.

00:58:25.160 --> 00:58:27.342 align:middle line:10%
Is it timebomb or timebombs?

00:58:27.342 --> 00:58:28.300 align:middle line:10%
>>PARK: Timebombs, yes.

00:58:28.300 --> 00:58:30.091 align:middle line:10%
>>REGINA: Timebombs,
telomeretimebombs.com.

00:58:30.091 --> 00:58:33.300 align:middle line:10%
And you'll be able to take
a look at some of the videos

00:58:33.300 --> 00:58:35.860 align:middle line:10%
that he's been talking about,
about these personal studies

00:58:35.860 --> 00:58:36.410 align:middle line:10%
and science.

00:58:36.410 --> 00:58:38.570 align:middle line:10%
And you can also
go to Amazon.com,

00:58:38.570 --> 00:58:43.070 align:middle line:10%
other major booksellers to find
the book, "Telomere Timebombs."

00:58:43.070 --> 00:58:47.580 align:middle line:84%
Until next time, thank you for
