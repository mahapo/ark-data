is more shrouded in mystery

00:00:29.830 --> 00:00:32.933 align:middle line:84%
and disinformation
than that of UFology.

00:00:32.933 --> 00:00:34.501 align:middle line:84%
While most of us are deeply
intrigued with the proof

00:00:34.501 --> 00:00:38.071 align:middle line:84%
of visitors from outer
space and other dimensions,

00:00:38.071 --> 00:00:41.575 align:middle line:84%
the subject has been mired
in frightful scenarios.

00:00:41.575 --> 00:00:43.877 align:middle line:84%
Paola Harris has been
researching the subject

00:00:43.877 --> 00:00:44.978 align:middle line:90%
for 30 years.

00:00:44.978 --> 00:00:46.246 align:middle line:90%
She's here to tell us about one

00:00:46.246 --> 00:00:48.248 align:middle line:84%
of the most intriguing
cases of all times.

00:00:48.248 --> 00:00:50.050 align:middle line:90%
The story of Val Thor.

00:00:50.050 --> 00:00:53.286 align:middle line:84%
As well as the trend regarding
the types of beings that appear

00:00:53.286 --> 00:00:55.055 align:middle line:90%
to be visiting us now.

00:00:55.055 --> 00:00:56.590 align:middle line:90%
Welcome Paola.

00:00:56.590 --> 00:00:58.892 align:middle line:84%
I've wanted to interview you
for probably the last 15 years

00:00:58.892 --> 00:01:02.095 align:middle line:84%
since I first started hearing
about your work in connection

00:01:02.095 --> 00:01:04.063 align:middle line:90%
with Lt. Colonel Philip Corso.

00:01:04.063 --> 00:01:07.300 align:middle line:84%
We'll talk about him a little
later, but a long the way

00:01:07.300 --> 00:01:09.736 align:middle line:84%
about that time I
came in contact

00:01:09.736 --> 00:01:12.238 align:middle line:84%
with this obscure
little book called

00:01:12.238 --> 00:01:14.708 align:middle line:90%
"Stranger at the Pentagon".

00:01:14.708 --> 00:01:16.276 align:middle line:84%
And you've actually
-- you have some

00:01:16.276 --> 00:01:20.247 align:middle line:84%
of the most phenomenal photos
from a very precious archive --

00:01:20.247 --> 00:01:22.482 align:middle line:90%
from Wendelle Stevens.

00:01:22.482 --> 00:01:25.552 align:middle line:90%
He's a life-long UFO researcher.

00:01:25.552 --> 00:01:27.487 align:middle line:84%
And so we're going to
get into all of that.

00:01:27.487 --> 00:01:30.724 align:middle line:84%
But first of all you have
really deep connections.

00:01:30.724 --> 00:01:32.993 align:middle line:84%
So give us a little
bit of background

00:01:32.993 --> 00:01:34.561 align:middle line:90%
on how you started this out.

00:01:34.561 --> 00:01:37.964 align:middle line:84%
And no less, 30 years ago when
other people weren't doing it.

00:01:37.964 --> 00:01:39.933 align:middle line:84%
>> Paola Harris: Well it's
so nice to be here Regina.

00:01:39.933 --> 00:01:42.002 align:middle line:84%
You know, it isn't
a normal occupation.

00:01:42.002 --> 00:01:43.603 align:middle line:84%
It isn't a normal hobby
[background chuckles].

00:01:43.603 --> 00:01:46.339 align:middle line:84%
And it's not a normal anything
to be interested in this

00:01:46.339 --> 00:01:48.208 align:middle line:90%
because people call it "fringe".

00:01:48.208 --> 00:01:52.678 align:middle line:84%
In other words, fringe research
or fringe investigations.

00:01:52.678 --> 00:01:54.047 align:middle line:84%
And I got started
quite by accident.

00:01:54.047 --> 00:01:57.517 align:middle line:84%
Everything has been
synchronistic in my life.

00:01:57.517 --> 00:02:01.221 align:middle line:84%
I saw the movie -- I was a
young mother and I saw the movie

00:02:01.221 --> 00:02:03.690 align:middle line:84%
"Close Encounters
of the Third Kind",

00:02:03.690 --> 00:02:08.061 align:middle line:84%
and the very last scene there
where Francois Truffaut --

00:02:08.061 --> 00:02:09.496 align:middle line:90%
who plays Jack Voulet --

00:02:09.496 --> 00:02:12.933 align:middle line:84%
has the encounter or the
contact with the beings.

00:02:12.933 --> 00:02:15.368 align:middle line:84%
I had an incredible
reaction to that.

00:02:15.368 --> 00:02:17.537 align:middle line:84%
I began to cry and
I was very emotional

00:02:17.537 --> 00:02:20.774 align:middle line:84%
and I asked myself,
why do I have this?

00:02:20.774 --> 00:02:25.212 align:middle line:84%
A reaction to contact on a film
that just came out that had --

00:02:25.212 --> 00:02:28.348 align:middle line:84%
that I learned later on
had a lot of truth in it.

00:02:28.348 --> 00:02:32.152 align:middle line:84%
At that time synchronistically,
I was teaching in Broomfield,

00:02:32.152 --> 00:02:33.453 align:middle line:90%
Colorado science fiction.

00:02:33.453 --> 00:02:35.455 align:middle line:90%
A class called science fiction,

00:02:35.455 --> 00:02:36.990 align:middle line:84%
and "Star Wars" had
just come out --

00:02:36.990 --> 00:02:38.825 align:middle line:84%
>> Regina: Just down the road
from where we are right now.

00:02:38.825 --> 00:02:39.626 align:middle line:90%
>> Paola: Yeah.

00:02:39.626 --> 00:02:40.861 align:middle line:90%
Actually -- and so I was --

00:02:40.861 --> 00:02:42.528 align:middle line:84%
because by trade I'm
an English teacher.

00:02:42.528 --> 00:02:44.264 align:middle line:84%
I have a Masters in
education, so I'm an educator.

00:02:44.264 --> 00:02:46.233 align:middle line:90%
And I had this reaction.

00:02:46.233 --> 00:02:49.402 align:middle line:84%
So I thought to myself, I
want to meet the consultant

00:02:49.402 --> 00:02:52.172 align:middle line:84%
on this film, Dr.
J. Allen Hynek.

00:02:52.172 --> 00:02:58.311 align:middle line:84%
Who, as everyone knows,
was the Blue Book person.

00:02:58.311 --> 00:03:01.648 align:middle line:90%
And basically Hynek had a --

00:03:01.648 --> 00:03:04.985 align:middle line:84%
his Center for UFO Studies
in Evanston, Illinois.

00:03:04.985 --> 00:03:07.420 align:middle line:84%
And serendipitously, I had a
wedding in Evanston, Illinois.

00:03:07.420 --> 00:03:11.825 align:middle line:84%
So I walked into his
Center for UFO Studies.

00:03:11.825 --> 00:03:13.860 align:middle line:84%
I didn't think he was
there, but he was there.

00:03:13.860 --> 00:03:16.062 align:middle line:84%
Came from around the corner
with that famous pipe.

00:03:16.062 --> 00:03:17.364 align:middle line:84%
That, you know, he has
a cameo in the movie

00:03:17.364 --> 00:03:19.499 align:middle line:84%
where he comes out
with the pipe.

00:03:19.499 --> 00:03:22.235 align:middle line:84%
And he said to me, "Well
my secretary tells me

00:03:22.235 --> 00:03:25.405 align:middle line:84%
that you're Italian, and
that you can do translations

00:03:25.405 --> 00:03:27.374 align:middle line:90%
for me for my Italian cases.

00:03:27.374 --> 00:03:28.642 align:middle line:90%
Would you like to work with me?"

00:03:28.642 --> 00:03:33.313 align:middle line:84%
So I worked with him
until he died in 1986.

00:03:33.313 --> 00:03:37.717 align:middle line:84%
And what I realized Regina,
was that I had the best teacher

00:03:37.717 --> 00:03:39.953 align:middle line:84%
because I knew it was
real right off the bat.

00:03:39.953 --> 00:03:42.222 align:middle line:84%
>> Regina: You - okay you
mentioned Blue Book a little

00:03:42.222 --> 00:03:43.323 align:middle line:90%
bit ago.

00:03:43.323 --> 00:03:44.658 align:middle line:84%
So why don't you
fill our audience

00:03:44.658 --> 00:03:46.960 align:middle line:90%
in on Project Blue Book.

00:03:46.960 --> 00:03:47.761 align:middle line:90%
Its inception.

00:03:47.761 --> 00:03:49.062 align:middle line:90%
What it was designed to do.

00:03:49.062 --> 00:03:50.430 align:middle line:90%
And what it did not do.

00:03:50.430 --> 00:03:53.099 align:middle line:84%
>> Paola: Well, Project Blue
Book was the Air Force program

00:03:53.099 --> 00:03:56.703 align:middle line:84%
that studied -- supposedly
studied UFO cases.

00:03:56.703 --> 00:03:58.438 align:middle line:84%
And Allen told me that
there were a lot of cases

00:03:58.438 --> 00:04:02.842 align:middle line:84%
that he considered, you
know, unexplainable,

00:04:02.842 --> 00:04:04.377 align:middle line:90%
that the Air Force dismissed.

00:04:04.377 --> 00:04:07.514 align:middle line:84%
That was one of his reasons
for leaving Project Blue Book.

00:04:07.514 --> 00:04:10.383 align:middle line:84%
Was because he was told
to try to explain it

00:04:10.383 --> 00:04:12.319 align:middle line:90%
in the best way he could.

00:04:12.319 --> 00:04:15.555 align:middle line:84%
So he's famous -- and
researchers still made him pay

00:04:15.555 --> 00:04:18.525 align:middle line:84%
for it for using the
term, "Swamp Gas".

00:04:18.525 --> 00:04:21.494 align:middle line:84%
Okay? So it was an easy
way to go to the media.

00:04:21.494 --> 00:04:23.863 align:middle line:90%
And the idea of the media --

00:04:23.863 --> 00:04:26.232 align:middle line:84%
I'm really interested
in how they cover this.

00:04:26.232 --> 00:04:29.469 align:middle line:84%
And using a term that dismisses
it right away with the amount

00:04:29.469 --> 00:04:32.439 align:middle line:90%
of ridicule that goes with it.

00:04:32.439 --> 00:04:34.274 align:middle line:84%
However, we've got
to remember Hynek --

00:04:34.274 --> 00:04:35.642 align:middle line:84%
>> Regina: Well tell people
what you're talking about,

00:04:35.642 --> 00:04:36.710 align:middle line:90%
about swamp gas.

00:04:36.710 --> 00:04:38.178 align:middle line:90%
And we're talking --

00:04:38.178 --> 00:04:40.847 align:middle line:84%
I mean we're going back into
Roswell and such as well.

00:04:40.847 --> 00:04:44.483 align:middle line:84%
>> Paola: Yeah well, I think the
swamp gas explanation was used

00:04:44.483 --> 00:04:45.752 align:middle line:90%
for a case up in Michigan.

00:04:45.752 --> 00:04:47.220 align:middle line:84%
I'm not quite sure
exactly which case.

00:04:47.220 --> 00:04:51.958 align:middle line:84%
And Allen said he only had
24 hours to say something.

00:04:51.958 --> 00:04:55.628 align:middle line:84%
So the swamp gas explanation
was a way of dismissing it,

00:04:55.628 --> 00:04:59.299 align:middle line:84%
even though Allen himself
was very, very honest

00:04:59.299 --> 00:05:03.370 align:middle line:84%
and very curious, and did
excellent investigating.

00:05:03.370 --> 00:05:06.206 align:middle line:84%
But you know, you can't
walk both sides of the road.

00:05:06.206 --> 00:05:07.207 align:middle line:90%
You can't walk both sides --

00:05:07.207 --> 00:05:07.974 align:middle line:90%
>> Regina: Not in this field.

00:05:07.974 --> 00:05:08.775 align:middle line:90%
>> Paola: No.

00:05:08.775 --> 00:05:10.076 align:middle line:90%
You have to take a decision.

00:05:10.076 --> 00:05:13.313 align:middle line:84%
And he decided to leave
the Air Force program,

00:05:13.313 --> 00:05:17.517 align:middle line:84%
and start the Center for UFO
Studies, which is still going

00:05:17.517 --> 00:05:19.052 align:middle line:90%
in Evanston, Illinois.

00:05:19.052 --> 00:05:21.087 align:middle line:84%
>> Regina: And there was
some pretty cloudy research

00:05:21.087 --> 00:05:23.022 align:middle line:84%
that was done by the
Air Force at this time.

00:05:23.022 --> 00:05:25.992 align:middle line:84%
And a lot of this was in
response to those sightings --

00:05:25.992 --> 00:05:28.161 align:middle line:84%
well not sightings,
but supposed crashes

00:05:28.161 --> 00:05:31.331 align:middle line:84%
that have been well documented
in the 40s and into the 50s.

00:05:31.331 --> 00:05:35.301 align:middle line:84%
And wasn't it -- when did they
close down Project Blue Book?

00:05:35.301 --> 00:05:36.403 align:middle line:90%
It was -- it didn't last.

00:05:36.403 --> 00:05:37.737 align:middle line:84%
The project didn't
last that long.

00:05:37.737 --> 00:05:39.239 align:middle line:90%
>> Paola: Well I think it was --

00:05:39.239 --> 00:05:43.309 align:middle line:84%
it came to a head with the
Condon Committee Report here.

00:05:43.309 --> 00:05:44.477 align:middle line:90%
>> Regina: Yes.

00:05:44.477 --> 00:05:45.712 align:middle line:84%
>> Paola: In the
University of Colorado.

00:05:45.712 --> 00:05:46.446 align:middle line:90%
>> Regina: Yes.

00:05:46.446 --> 00:05:47.447 align:middle line:90%
Ridicules, yeah.

00:05:47.447 --> 00:05:48.615 align:middle line:90%
>> Paola: And I said, Colorado,

00:05:48.615 --> 00:05:50.583 align:middle line:84%
the university has
some karma there.

00:05:50.583 --> 00:05:51.584 align:middle line:90%
>> Regina: Yeah.

00:05:51.584 --> 00:05:52.452 align:middle line:90%
>> Paola: Because [chuckles] --

00:05:52.452 --> 00:05:53.686 align:middle line:90%
>> Regina: That was bad.

00:05:53.686 --> 00:05:55.054 align:middle line:84%
>> Paola: Because
well, that was 1969 --

00:05:55.054 --> 00:05:56.156 align:middle line:84%
>> Regina: So explain what
the Condon Report did,

00:05:56.156 --> 00:05:57.123 align:middle line:84%
so everyone has background
on this.

00:05:57.123 --> 00:05:58.425 align:middle line:90%
>> Paola: Alright.

00:05:58.425 --> 00:06:00.527 align:middle line:84%
Well the Air Force decided
to put a stop to everything

00:06:00.527 --> 00:06:01.828 align:middle line:84%
by just putting out
one statement.

00:06:01.828 --> 00:06:06.266 align:middle line:84%
And they hired Joseph
Condon and a team here

00:06:06.266 --> 00:06:07.734 align:middle line:90%
at the University of Colorado.

00:06:07.734 --> 00:06:11.371 align:middle line:84%
They were paid to supposedly
look into these cases.

00:06:11.371 --> 00:06:14.707 align:middle line:84%
And I don't know how they could
dismiss something like Maelstrom

00:06:14.707 --> 00:06:18.578 align:middle line:84%
or Air Force base, you know,
missile shutdown in 69.

00:06:18.578 --> 00:06:22.816 align:middle line:84%
They dismissed all of that and
Condon came out with a whitewash

00:06:22.816 --> 00:06:24.417 align:middle line:90%
in 1969 here in Colorado.

00:06:24.417 --> 00:06:27.554 align:middle line:84%
Well it upset everybody
because people that are

00:06:27.554 --> 00:06:33.460 align:middle line:84%
in serious research were hoping
for an honest assessment.

00:06:33.460 --> 00:06:34.994 align:middle line:90%
So that's how it got close.

00:06:34.994 --> 00:06:38.364 align:middle line:84%
That's how the Air Force
got out of the UFO business.

00:06:38.364 --> 00:06:41.067 align:middle line:84%
But you know, I'm still thinking
they're still interested.

00:06:41.067 --> 00:06:42.235 align:middle line:84%
They have to be because
whatever's

00:06:42.235 --> 00:06:44.404 align:middle line:84%
in the skies is of
their competence.

00:06:44.404 --> 00:06:47.307 align:middle line:84%
>> Regina: Oh it's not as
though the curiosity finished.

00:06:47.307 --> 00:06:49.542 align:middle line:84%
It's not as though even
the research finished.

00:06:49.542 --> 00:06:50.944 align:middle line:90%
It's that their public --

00:06:50.944 --> 00:06:54.747 align:middle line:84%
their statement to the
public was basically formed

00:06:54.747 --> 00:06:55.849 align:middle line:90%
at that time.

00:06:55.849 --> 00:06:58.685 align:middle line:84%
Which is ehh, it's
mostly not real.

00:06:58.685 --> 00:06:59.986 align:middle line:90%
It's not real.

00:06:59.986 --> 00:07:02.655 align:middle line:84%
There are explainable
answers for all of this.

00:07:02.655 --> 00:07:04.491 align:middle line:84%
So let's not look that
direction anymore.

00:07:04.491 --> 00:07:07.093 align:middle line:84%
But we know that they are
looking that direction.

00:07:07.093 --> 00:07:08.061 align:middle line:84%
And especially when
you go deeper

00:07:08.061 --> 00:07:09.696 align:middle line:90%
into the Black Ops projects

00:07:09.696 --> 00:07:10.563 align:middle line:84%
from the various
branches of the military.

00:07:10.563 --> 00:07:12.532 align:middle line:90%
Absolutely.

00:07:12.532 --> 00:07:14.501 align:middle line:84%
>> Paola: Well also it's a
matter of national security

00:07:14.501 --> 00:07:15.668 align:middle line:90%
because most of my interviews

00:07:15.668 --> 00:07:16.803 align:middle line:84%
and all my books
are military people.

00:07:16.803 --> 00:07:19.439 align:middle line:84%
Pilots and air traffic
controllers

00:07:19.439 --> 00:07:23.643 align:middle line:84%
that really are seriously
concerned with pilots

00:07:23.643 --> 00:07:27.113 align:middle line:84%
that are having these encounters
all over the world in the skies.

00:07:27.113 --> 00:07:29.315 align:middle line:84%
I mean that's a national
security issue.

00:07:29.315 --> 00:07:33.753 align:middle line:84%
So I don't -- you know, I
don't see where that is logical

00:07:33.753 --> 00:07:35.421 align:middle line:84%
that they would shut down
the investigation of this.

00:07:35.421 --> 00:07:38.558 align:middle line:84%
It might not be the Air Force
though that's looking into this.

00:07:38.558 --> 00:07:42.729 align:middle line:90%
It may be another agency.

00:07:42.729 --> 00:07:43.997 align:middle line:90%
>> Regina: Right.

00:07:43.997 --> 00:07:45.598 align:middle line:84%
Right. Okay so this
-- so that's what kind

00:07:45.598 --> 00:07:48.568 align:middle line:90%
of put you on your path.

00:07:48.568 --> 00:07:50.036 align:middle line:84%
But then you were
really intrepid,

00:07:50.036 --> 00:07:51.938 align:middle line:84%
I mean in following
up from there.

00:07:51.938 --> 00:07:55.909 align:middle line:84%
And you ended up in contact with
some really profound researchers

00:07:55.909 --> 00:07:57.777 align:middle line:90%
and experiencers in this field.

00:07:57.777 --> 00:07:59.646 align:middle line:90%
Including in the miliary.

00:07:59.646 --> 00:08:01.147 align:middle line:90%
>> Paola: Yeah I did.

00:08:01.147 --> 00:08:02.949 align:middle line:84%
And you know in the beginning
when I was with Dr. Hynek

00:08:02.949 --> 00:08:04.984 align:middle line:84%
and we would drive around
and listen to people.

00:08:04.984 --> 00:08:08.721 align:middle line:84%
And occasionally we'd listen
to people who had contact.

00:08:08.721 --> 00:08:10.757 align:middle line:84%
I remember saying to
him, that can't be.

00:08:10.757 --> 00:08:14.527 align:middle line:84%
I couldn't -- my database would
not take the contact scenario

00:08:14.527 --> 00:08:15.762 align:middle line:90%
into play.

00:08:15.762 --> 00:08:17.597 align:middle line:84%
I mean I've changed
so much in 30 years;

00:08:17.597 --> 00:08:18.932 align:middle line:90%
I've learned so much more.

00:08:18.932 --> 00:08:20.667 align:middle line:84%
But in those days I
said, are you kidding me?

00:08:20.667 --> 00:08:22.702 align:middle line:90%
I mean people taken aboard.

00:08:22.702 --> 00:08:26.172 align:middle line:84%
I mean I don't know where my
mind was at but it was so nuts

00:08:26.172 --> 00:08:29.008 align:middle line:84%
and bolts that -- and the reason
why I'm talking about this --

00:08:29.008 --> 00:08:30.243 align:middle line:90%
I think this happens to people.

00:08:30.243 --> 00:08:33.713 align:middle line:84%
Because when you realize
that this is real,

00:08:33.713 --> 00:08:38.718 align:middle line:84%
it changes your entire
paradigm of reality.

00:08:38.718 --> 00:08:39.585 align:middle line:90%
>> Regina: Yes.

00:08:39.585 --> 00:08:40.486 align:middle line:90%
>> Paola: It shakes you.

00:08:40.486 --> 00:08:41.753 align:middle line:90%
>> Regina: Yes.

00:08:41.753 --> 00:08:43.989 align:middle line:84%
And right now, I mean
I think in a sense,

00:08:43.989 --> 00:08:47.093 align:middle line:84%
with a lot of our viewers we
may be preaching to the choir.

00:08:47.093 --> 00:08:50.029 align:middle line:84%
Other people are new
to this and it is very,

00:08:50.029 --> 00:08:53.633 align:middle line:84%
if not mind-expanding, mind
blowing even for a lot of people

00:08:53.633 --> 00:08:57.637 align:middle line:84%
when you start realizing how
alone we are not [chuckles].

00:08:57.637 --> 00:08:58.571 align:middle line:90%
We are not alone.

00:08:58.571 --> 00:09:00.073 align:middle line:90%
We have never been alone.

00:09:00.073 --> 00:09:03.076 align:middle line:84%
It's arguable as to who's
even indigenous to this planet

00:09:03.076 --> 00:09:04.777 align:middle line:90%
if you go far back enough.

00:09:04.777 --> 00:09:09.949 align:middle line:84%
But let's talk about you -- you
came into contact and dialog

00:09:09.949 --> 00:09:11.584 align:middle line:90%
and a relationship --

00:09:11.584 --> 00:09:13.019 align:middle line:90%
professional relationship

00:09:13.019 --> 00:09:16.189 align:middle line:84%
with a former Canadian
Defense Minister, Paul Hellyer.

00:09:16.189 --> 00:09:18.658 align:middle line:84%
Let's talk about that
for just a minute.

00:09:18.658 --> 00:09:19.759 align:middle line:90%
That was big.

00:09:19.759 --> 00:09:21.027 align:middle line:84%
>> Paola: Well I
was -- it was big.

00:09:21.027 --> 00:09:22.895 align:middle line:84%
And it goes with all
the credible witnesses

00:09:22.895 --> 00:09:26.065 align:middle line:84%
that are really interested
in this scenario.

00:09:26.065 --> 00:09:29.235 align:middle line:84%
I was invited to speak in
Canada with Paul Hellyer,

00:09:29.235 --> 00:09:31.704 align:middle line:84%
Stanton Freedman,
Richard Dolan,

00:09:31.704 --> 00:09:33.539 align:middle line:90%
and Steve Basset.

00:09:33.539 --> 00:09:34.974 align:middle line:90%
>> Regina: Yes.

00:09:34.974 --> 00:09:36.943 align:middle line:84%
>> Paola: But something
happened where I couldn't come.

00:09:36.943 --> 00:09:38.111 align:middle line:84%
I was living in Rome
at the time.

00:09:38.111 --> 00:09:43.082 align:middle line:84%
I've lived in Rome
from 1992 to 2005.

00:09:43.082 --> 00:09:44.550 align:middle line:84%
And I was ill and
I couldn't make it.

00:09:44.550 --> 00:09:48.554 align:middle line:84%
So on my own dime -- and
this is why I tell you --

00:09:48.554 --> 00:09:50.556 align:middle line:84%
on my own dime I flew to
Canada to interview him.

00:09:50.556 --> 00:09:56.529 align:middle line:84%
Because I saw the potential
for someone that credible

00:09:56.529 --> 00:09:59.699 align:middle line:84%
who was saying -- and the
quote is, "UFOs are as real

00:09:59.699 --> 00:10:02.335 align:middle line:90%
as the airplanes over our head."

00:10:02.335 --> 00:10:05.171 align:middle line:84%
That was the one quote he
said, and then he said that --

00:10:05.171 --> 00:10:07.573 align:middle line:84%
>> Regina: Then he was in a
position to clearly know that.

00:10:07.573 --> 00:10:08.307 align:middle line:90%
>> Paola: To know that.

00:10:08.307 --> 00:10:09.008 align:middle line:90%
>> Regina: Yes.

00:10:09.008 --> 00:10:10.009 align:middle line:90%
>> Paola: To know that.

00:10:10.009 --> 00:10:11.110 align:middle line:90%
I mean he's Defense Minister.

00:10:11.110 --> 00:10:12.679 align:middle line:84%
He was Defense Minister
of Canada

00:10:12.679 --> 00:10:15.748 align:middle line:84%
when McNamara was Defense
Minister under Kennedy.

00:10:15.748 --> 00:10:20.653 align:middle line:84%
So I mean this is a man who is
clearly concerned and thinks

00:10:20.653 --> 00:10:25.324 align:middle line:84%
that what Colonel Corso
was saying in the day

00:10:25.324 --> 00:10:31.397 align:middle line:84%
after Roswell was absolutely
the most clear explanation

00:10:31.397 --> 00:10:32.598 align:middle line:90%
for the cover up.

00:10:32.598 --> 00:10:34.500 align:middle line:84%
Now we have to understand,
Colonel Philip Corso --

00:10:34.500 --> 00:10:36.235 align:middle line:84%
the book is "The Day
After Roswell" --

00:10:36.235 --> 00:10:37.704 align:middle line:90%
was the first to come out

00:10:37.704 --> 00:10:40.673 align:middle line:84%
and say the reason why this
information is occulted --

00:10:40.673 --> 00:10:44.877 align:middle line:84%
why it's kept secret -- is
because the United States,

00:10:44.877 --> 00:10:48.881 align:middle line:84%
since Roswell, and I
will add since 1940 --

00:10:48.881 --> 00:10:54.020 align:middle line:90%
since 1945 has really --

00:10:54.020 --> 00:10:56.889 align:middle line:84%
they have back-engineered
this technology.

00:10:56.889 --> 00:10:58.758 align:middle line:90%
>> Regina: Yes.

00:10:58.758 --> 00:11:00.259 align:middle line:84%
>> Paola: It's kept
in black projects.

00:11:00.259 --> 00:11:05.932 align:middle line:84%
And it would replace our current
economic system under oil

00:11:05.932 --> 00:11:07.166 align:middle line:90%
and petroleum and so forth.

00:11:07.166 --> 00:11:08.401 align:middle line:90%
So there is a real reason.

00:11:08.401 --> 00:11:10.937 align:middle line:84%
It's got nothing to
do with the aliens,

00:11:10.937 --> 00:11:13.806 align:middle line:84%
or with the downfall
of religion I think.

00:11:13.806 --> 00:11:16.309 align:middle line:90%
Because I also was involved

00:11:16.309 --> 00:11:18.077 align:middle line:84%
with Monsignor Balducci
of the Vatican.

00:11:18.077 --> 00:11:19.512 align:middle line:90%
>> Regina: Yes.

00:11:19.512 --> 00:11:21.247 align:middle line:84%
>> Paola: And I was also
involved because I lived in Rome

00:11:21.247 --> 00:11:23.649 align:middle line:90%
with that information.

00:11:23.649 --> 00:11:24.851 align:middle line:90%
It is a matter of economics.

00:11:24.851 --> 00:11:25.885 align:middle line:90%
That's the bottom line.

00:11:25.885 --> 00:11:27.720 align:middle line:90%
>> Regina: Okay.

00:11:27.720 --> 00:11:29.322 align:middle line:90%
So now let's talk about that.

00:11:29.322 --> 00:11:30.690 align:middle line:90%
Out of Philip Corso's work.

00:11:30.690 --> 00:11:33.960 align:middle line:84%
So explain who Philip
-- we have time to talk

00:11:33.960 --> 00:11:37.130 align:middle line:84%
about it before we go to
the story of Valient Thor.

00:11:37.130 --> 00:11:37.864 align:middle line:90%
>> Paola: Okay.

00:11:37.864 --> 00:11:39.399 align:middle line:90%
>> Regina: Okay.

00:11:39.399 --> 00:11:45.004 align:middle line:84%
So Philip Corso was tasked by
high-end command individual.

00:11:45.004 --> 00:11:46.139 align:middle line:90%
Was it Twining?

00:11:46.139 --> 00:11:47.907 align:middle line:84%
>> Paola: No it was
General Trudeau.

00:11:47.907 --> 00:11:48.641 align:middle line:90%
>> Regina: General Trudeau.

00:11:48.641 --> 00:11:49.475 align:middle line:90%
>> Paola: Yeah.

00:11:49.475 --> 00:11:50.877 align:middle line:90%
>> Regina: Okay.

00:11:50.877 --> 00:11:55.348 align:middle line:84%
By General Trudeau with making
sense out of filing cabinet full

00:11:55.348 --> 00:11:58.184 align:middle line:84%
of stuff -- pieces and
parts [background chuckles].

00:11:58.184 --> 00:12:02.288 align:middle line:84%
Interestingly, explain
what happened at the time,

00:12:02.288 --> 00:12:06.125 align:middle line:84%
because he was witness to the
bodies of the crash of Roswell.

00:12:06.125 --> 00:12:07.927 align:middle line:84%
>> Paola: Well actually
what happened was

00:12:07.927 --> 00:12:13.299 align:middle line:84%
that Colonel Corso throughout
his life had had experiences.

00:12:13.299 --> 00:12:17.904 align:middle line:84%
Hew as witness to bodies that
were transported by truck to Ft.

00:12:17.904 --> 00:12:19.772 align:middle line:90%
Riley, Kansas --

00:12:19.772 --> 00:12:20.640 align:middle line:90%
>> Regina: Yes.

00:12:20.640 --> 00:12:22.175 align:middle line:90%
>> Paola: -- in 1947.

00:12:22.175 --> 00:12:24.844 align:middle line:84%
And you know, the reason why
I'm not putting the word Roswell

00:12:24.844 --> 00:12:27.613 align:middle line:84%
on there is because we had
three crashes at that time.

00:12:27.613 --> 00:12:29.081 align:middle line:84%
We didn't just have
Roswell, we had --

00:12:29.081 --> 00:12:30.216 align:middle line:90%
>> Regina: I only bring it

00:12:30.216 --> 00:12:31.083 align:middle line:84%
up because it's the
most well known.

00:12:31.083 --> 00:12:32.151 align:middle line:90%
People know about this.

00:12:32.151 --> 00:12:33.019 align:middle line:90%
>> Paola: Yeah.

00:12:33.019 --> 00:12:34.187 align:middle line:90%
Yeah. We had several --

00:12:34.187 --> 00:12:34.754 align:middle line:84%
>> Regina: And you
can explain that.

00:12:34.754 --> 00:12:36.322 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

00:12:36.322 --> 00:12:37.890 align:middle line:84%
>> Paola: -- crashes and people
are going to ask, well how come?

00:12:37.890 --> 00:12:39.792 align:middle line:84%
Well because whatever was flying
around was extremely interested

00:12:39.792 --> 00:12:45.031 align:middle line:84%
in White Sands, the Trinity
Site, and the 501 bomb squadron,

00:12:45.031 --> 00:12:46.032 align:middle line:90%
which was housed in Roswell.

00:12:46.032 --> 00:12:48.234 align:middle line:90%
They're the ones that, you know,

00:12:48.234 --> 00:12:51.103 align:middle line:84%
that were involved
with the atomic bomb.

00:12:51.103 --> 00:12:52.672 align:middle line:90%
Whatever --

00:12:52.672 --> 00:12:54.607 align:middle line:84%
>> Regina: They're -- and the
ETs have traditionally been very

00:12:54.607 --> 00:12:56.709 align:middle line:84%
concerned about, and
kept a watchful eye

00:12:56.709 --> 00:13:00.079 align:middle line:84%
on the proliferation of
atomic weaponry on this --

00:13:00.079 --> 00:13:01.614 align:middle line:84%
around this planet
ever since then.

00:13:01.614 --> 00:13:02.815 align:middle line:90%
I mean this is ongoing.

00:13:02.815 --> 00:13:04.617 align:middle line:84%
>> Paola: Well it
changes the game.

00:13:04.617 --> 00:13:05.985 align:middle line:90%
>> Regina: Yes.

00:13:05.985 --> 00:13:07.386 align:middle line:84%
>> Paola: I mean here -- it
changes the game for everybody.

00:13:07.386 --> 00:13:08.955 align:middle line:84%
It certainly changed
the game for us.

00:13:08.955 --> 00:13:12.892 align:middle line:84%
I remember growing up in the 50s
and having to go under my desk

00:13:12.892 --> 00:13:14.927 align:middle line:90%
in case there was an atomic --

00:13:14.927 --> 00:13:16.095 align:middle line:90%
>> Regina: Yep.

00:13:16.095 --> 00:13:17.330 align:middle line:84%
>> Paola: -- you
know, I don't know --

00:13:17.330 --> 00:13:19.098 align:middle line:84%
I remember how scared
to death we were.

00:13:19.098 --> 00:13:20.199 align:middle line:90%
>> Regina: Yes.

00:13:20.199 --> 00:13:21.434 align:middle line:84%
>> Paola: But we
had reason to be.

00:13:21.434 --> 00:13:23.035 align:middle line:84%
Because then we had
the Cuban Missile --

00:13:23.035 --> 00:13:24.437 align:middle line:90%
we had all kinds of history.

00:13:24.437 --> 00:13:26.706 align:middle line:84%
>> Regina: And so meanwhile,
as that was escalating,

00:13:26.706 --> 00:13:30.409 align:middle line:84%
ET activity on this planet
was escalating as well.

00:13:30.409 --> 00:13:32.211 align:middle line:84%
And the military was
fully aware of it.

00:13:32.211 --> 00:13:34.780 align:middle line:90%
Because when things like Roswell

00:13:34.780 --> 00:13:37.450 align:middle line:84%
and the other crash sites
occurred, they were the first

00:13:37.450 --> 00:13:38.918 align:middle line:84%
on the spot, and they showed
everyone up really quickly.

00:13:38.918 --> 00:13:40.987 align:middle line:90%
Talk about what happened.

00:13:40.987 --> 00:13:42.889 align:middle line:90%
The body he saw in transport.

00:13:42.889 --> 00:13:45.124 align:middle line:84%
>> Paola: Well the body that
he saw -- well he was at Ft.

00:13:45.124 --> 00:13:46.225 align:middle line:90%
Riley, Kansas.

00:13:46.225 --> 00:13:48.194 align:middle line:84%
He was in charge
of the base there.

00:13:48.194 --> 00:13:52.498 align:middle line:84%
And one of the military
men said, well Colonel,

00:13:52.498 --> 00:13:54.233 align:middle line:84%
there came a cargo
and it's in --

00:13:54.233 --> 00:13:56.002 align:middle line:84%
and it's in the veterinary
quarters can you

00:13:56.002 --> 00:13:56.669 align:middle line:90%
imagine [chuckles]?

00:13:56.669 --> 00:13:57.670 align:middle line:90%
So --

00:13:57.670 --> 00:13:58.704 align:middle line:84%
>> Regina: [Chuckles]
with animals.

00:13:58.704 --> 00:14:00.072 align:middle line:90%
And it's a little ET.

00:14:00.072 --> 00:14:01.507 align:middle line:84%
>> Paola: I know [chuckles] and
Colonel Corso went in there,

00:14:01.507 --> 00:14:02.975 align:middle line:84%
lifted up the lid
-- the tarpaulin --

00:14:02.975 --> 00:14:06.112 align:middle line:90%
she said that there were --

00:14:06.112 --> 00:14:09.282 align:middle line:84%
there was a body there
that looked like a child,

00:14:09.282 --> 00:14:11.851 align:middle line:90%
but it had a very big head.

00:14:11.851 --> 00:14:13.119 align:middle line:90%
And he realized right away

00:14:13.119 --> 00:14:16.322 align:middle line:84%
that this was something
completely unusual.

00:14:16.322 --> 00:14:18.391 align:middle line:90%
He put the lid back on.

00:14:18.391 --> 00:14:22.962 align:middle line:84%
Told the gentlemen there
-- the military guy --

00:14:22.962 --> 00:14:24.263 align:middle line:90%
we've got to get out of here,

00:14:24.263 --> 00:14:27.533 align:middle line:84%
because this obviously
is something top secret.

00:14:27.533 --> 00:14:29.936 align:middle line:84%
But he said to me, he said,
"Well I put it in the back

00:14:29.936 --> 00:14:33.639 align:middle line:84%
of my mind because I knew I'd
come up with -- you know, I --

00:14:33.639 --> 00:14:35.107 align:middle line:84%
this would be something
in my future."

00:14:35.107 --> 00:14:38.878 align:middle line:90%
Now Colonel Corso was not lying.

00:14:38.878 --> 00:14:41.113 align:middle line:84%
He was telling the truth
about his involvement.

00:14:41.113 --> 00:14:45.151 align:middle line:84%
Because then in 1960s
-- in the 60s --

00:14:45.151 --> 00:14:50.089 align:middle line:84%
he received from General Trudeau
a what he called the "Nut File",

00:14:50.089 --> 00:14:54.260 align:middle line:84%
which had a lot of
artifacts from Roswell.

00:14:54.260 --> 00:14:56.796 align:middle line:84%
The ones he talks about
the most were the pens.

00:14:56.796 --> 00:14:58.130 align:middle line:90%
The ones that he said he --

00:14:58.130 --> 00:15:00.099 align:middle line:84%
that he thought the
batteries were missing.

00:15:00.099 --> 00:15:01.200 align:middle line:90%
But then he took it to Ft.

00:15:01.200 --> 00:15:02.668 align:middle line:90%
Belvoir, Maryland.

00:15:02.668 --> 00:15:05.838 align:middle line:84%
They put long low waves
on and the laser came out.

00:15:05.838 --> 00:15:08.274 align:middle line:90%
Now -- and to me he talked

00:15:08.274 --> 00:15:10.710 align:middle line:84%
about something else really
interesting you might want

00:15:10.710 --> 00:15:11.777 align:middle line:90%
to know.

00:15:11.777 --> 00:15:13.446 align:middle line:84%
He said, "I had -- "
he said, "A black --

00:15:13.446 --> 00:15:17.350 align:middle line:84%
it looked like a black covering"
he said, "That was a lens

00:15:17.350 --> 00:15:19.719 align:middle line:84%
that was over the
eye of the alien."

00:15:19.719 --> 00:15:20.820 align:middle line:90%
>> Regina: Yes.

00:15:20.820 --> 00:15:22.288 align:middle line:84%
>> Paola: He said it
was a light collector.

00:15:22.288 --> 00:15:23.756 align:middle line:84%
And he said, "We used
to play with that lens.

00:15:23.756 --> 00:15:25.591 align:middle line:84%
We used to walk up and down
the halls of the Pentagon

00:15:25.591 --> 00:15:27.159 align:middle line:90%
and we could see the furniture."

00:15:27.159 --> 00:15:32.331 align:middle line:84%
And he said, "What I had were
the artifacts, but my job was

00:15:32.331 --> 00:15:33.899 align:middle line:84%
to go to major companies
-- " and he names them.

00:15:33.899 --> 00:15:37.203 align:middle line:84%
>> Regina: Military
contractors, Rockwell --

00:15:37.203 --> 00:15:38.204 align:middle line:90%
>> Paola: Yes.

00:15:38.204 --> 00:15:39.038 align:middle line:90%
>> Regina: I mean a lot of them.

00:15:39.038 --> 00:15:40.439 align:middle line:90%
Dell Laboratories --

00:15:40.439 --> 00:15:44.610 align:middle line:84%
>> Paola: He said to --
first of all to replicate it

00:15:44.610 --> 00:15:48.914 align:middle line:84%
for the benefit -- and he
uses the competitive edge

00:15:48.914 --> 00:15:50.216 align:middle line:90%
of the Army.

00:15:50.216 --> 00:15:51.417 align:middle line:84%
And the reason why I'm
telling you that is

00:15:51.417 --> 00:15:55.588 align:middle line:84%
because in 1945 it
was Army/Air Force.

00:15:55.588 --> 00:15:58.024 align:middle line:84%
So you don't think that
when they split up,

00:15:58.024 --> 00:15:58.958 align:middle line:90%
the Air Force went one way.

00:15:58.958 --> 00:16:00.426 align:middle line:90%
The Army went another way.

00:16:00.426 --> 00:16:02.294 align:middle line:84%
The Air Force didn't take
some stuff with them and --

00:16:02.294 --> 00:16:03.596 align:middle line:90%
>> Regina: Oh yeah.

00:16:03.596 --> 00:16:05.164 align:middle line:84%
My understanding is all
-- including the Navy --

00:16:05.164 --> 00:16:06.899 align:middle line:84%
they all have their artifacts
that they have back engineered.

00:16:06.899 --> 00:16:08.768 align:middle line:84%
>> Paola: They all had the --
they just didn't have a Corso.

00:16:08.768 --> 00:16:10.503 align:middle line:84%
>> Regina: They didn't
have a Corso.

00:16:10.503 --> 00:16:12.171 align:middle line:84%
And again, he was -- he had a
responsibility as being the head

00:16:12.171 --> 00:16:15.908 align:middle line:84%
of foreign technology
for the Army.

00:16:15.908 --> 00:16:18.411 align:middle line:84%
Which foreign technology
means [chuckles] --

00:16:18.411 --> 00:16:19.645 align:middle line:84%
>> Paola: Really
foreign [chuckles].

00:16:19.645 --> 00:16:20.613 align:middle line:84%
>> Regina: Foreign
technology [chuckles].

00:16:20.613 --> 00:16:22.415 align:middle line:90%
It doesn't mean from France.

00:16:22.415 --> 00:16:23.582 align:middle line:90%
>> Paola: No, so --

00:16:23.582 --> 00:16:24.884 align:middle line:84%
>> Regina: And so
that was his job.

00:16:24.884 --> 00:16:25.785 align:middle line:84%
I mean there was such
a division because --

00:16:25.785 --> 00:16:26.886 align:middle line:90%
>> Paola: Yes.

00:16:26.886 --> 00:16:28.120 align:middle line:90%
>> Regina: - this is real.

00:16:28.120 --> 00:16:30.356 align:middle line:84%
And so some of the
technologies that came

00:16:30.356 --> 00:16:31.223 align:middle line:84%
out of there are
really familiar to us.

00:16:31.223 --> 00:16:33.626 align:middle line:90%
Like Kevlar.

00:16:33.626 --> 00:16:34.627 align:middle line:90%
>> Paola: Right.

00:16:34.627 --> 00:16:35.761 align:middle line:84%
>> Regina: Kevlar,
which police wear

00:16:35.761 --> 00:16:38.764 align:middle line:84%
in bulletproof vests
for example.

00:16:38.764 --> 00:16:40.866 align:middle line:90%
Fiberoptics, right?

00:16:40.866 --> 00:16:41.767 align:middle line:90%
>> Paola: Fiberoptics.

00:16:41.767 --> 00:16:42.968 align:middle line:90%
Night screening devices.

00:16:42.968 --> 00:16:43.636 align:middle line:90%
>> Regina: Night screening.

00:16:43.636 --> 00:16:44.470 align:middle line:90%
Lasers --

00:16:44.470 --> 00:16:45.604 align:middle line:90%
>> Paola: Because the lens --

00:16:45.604 --> 00:16:46.338 align:middle line:84%
because of the lens
-- the lasers --

00:16:46.338 --> 00:16:47.273 align:middle line:90%
>> Regina: Yes.

00:16:47.273 --> 00:16:48.140 align:middle line:90%
>> Paola: The transistor.

00:16:48.140 --> 00:16:49.575 align:middle line:90%
>> Regina: Transistor.

00:16:49.575 --> 00:16:51.010 align:middle line:84%
>> Paola: Everybody went
after him for the transistor.

00:16:51.010 --> 00:16:52.178 align:middle line:84%
Because I remember the criticism
back then, they'd said,

00:16:52.178 --> 00:16:53.813 align:middle line:90%
oh well we've already got this.

00:16:53.813 --> 00:16:55.581 align:middle line:84%
I felt like saying,
'sure you already have it

00:16:55.581 --> 00:16:58.150 align:middle line:84%
because probably the Air
Force was working on it too

00:16:58.150 --> 00:17:01.253 align:middle line:84%
with contracts way
back before the Army.

00:17:01.253 --> 00:17:02.221 align:middle line:84%
Corso got it in the
60s, but I mean --

00:17:02.221 --> 00:17:04.056 align:middle line:90%
>> Regina: He got it in 61.

00:17:04.056 --> 00:17:05.524 align:middle line:90%
>> Paola: Right.

00:17:05.524 --> 00:17:06.759 align:middle line:84%
>> Regina: But by the time
63, 64, or 65 rolled around,

00:17:06.759 --> 00:17:08.861 align:middle line:84%
everyone had little
transistor radios.

00:17:08.861 --> 00:17:09.929 align:middle line:90%
>> Paola: Right.

00:17:09.929 --> 00:17:11.096 align:middle line:84%
>> Regina: So it's
possible you're saying,

00:17:11.096 --> 00:17:11.931 align:middle line:90%
that the Air Force or Navy --

00:17:11.931 --> 00:17:13.164 align:middle line:90%
>> Paola: Well sure!

00:17:13.164 --> 00:17:13.899 align:middle line:84%
>> Regina: -- had
probably put it down --

00:17:13.899 --> 00:17:15.034 align:middle line:90%
>> Paola: Yeah.

00:17:15.034 --> 00:17:16.134 align:middle line:84%
>> Regina: -- and it had
been worked on for years

00:17:16.134 --> 00:17:17.670 align:middle line:90%
to reverse engineer that.

00:17:17.670 --> 00:17:18.903 align:middle line:84%
>> Paola: Well logically, if
you get a craft and the first --

00:17:18.903 --> 00:17:20.239 align:middle line:84%
and my research in
the 1945 San Antonio,

00:17:20.239 --> 00:17:22.173 align:middle line:90%
New Mexico crash, which is real.

00:17:22.173 --> 00:17:24.576 align:middle line:84%
You're going to get
a crash three miles

00:17:24.576 --> 00:17:26.144 align:middle line:90%
from White Sands there.

00:17:26.144 --> 00:17:29.748 align:middle line:84%
You're not going to throw the
pieces in the trash are you?

00:17:29.748 --> 00:17:31.283 align:middle line:90%
>> Regina: Heck no [chuckles].

00:17:31.283 --> 00:17:32.017 align:middle line:84%
>> Paola: I mean what are
you going to do with it?

00:17:32.017 --> 00:17:33.152 align:middle line:90%
>> Regina: No.

00:17:33.152 --> 00:17:34.120 align:middle line:84%
>> Paola: You've
got to do something

00:17:34.120 --> 00:17:34.920 align:middle line:90%
with it; this isn't garbage.

00:17:34.920 --> 00:17:35.621 align:middle line:90%
>> Regina: Right.

00:17:35.621 --> 00:17:36.922 align:middle line:90%
>> Paola: So, you know,

00:17:36.922 --> 00:17:38.924 align:middle line:84%
I'm wondering why people
aren't using logic --

00:17:38.924 --> 00:17:41.994 align:middle line:84%
more logic to look at this
phenomenon and the cover up.

00:17:41.994 --> 00:17:47.199 align:middle line:84%
Because obviously whatever we
had back then is going to be --

00:17:47.199 --> 00:17:49.902 align:middle line:90%
and we're talking 70 years ago.

00:17:49.902 --> 00:17:52.238 align:middle line:90%
Guess where we are today?

00:17:52.238 --> 00:17:55.474 align:middle line:84%
>> Regina: Well interestingly,
they wanted to make it clear

00:17:55.474 --> 00:17:57.977 align:middle line:84%
that this was a verboten
subject.

00:17:57.977 --> 00:17:59.311 align:middle line:84%
So everyone that came
out and talked about it

00:17:59.311 --> 00:18:02.648 align:middle line:84%
in a credible fashion,
and almost still

00:18:02.648 --> 00:18:04.216 align:middle line:84%
to this day really
was discredited.

00:18:04.216 --> 00:18:09.889 align:middle line:84%
So really it put such a horrid
sort of kind of giggle factor

00:18:09.889 --> 00:18:12.892 align:middle line:84%
around it, that it seemed
to me everyone was afraid.

00:18:12.892 --> 00:18:14.226 align:middle line:84%
They were afraid, A, they
had security clearances

00:18:14.226 --> 00:18:15.494 align:middle line:90%
that they were afraid to break

00:18:15.494 --> 00:18:18.264 align:middle line:84%
because that hadn't
carried a stiff penalty.

00:18:18.264 --> 00:18:20.566 align:middle line:84%
But in addition, on a
personal level, you didn't want

00:18:20.566 --> 00:18:22.268 align:middle line:84%
to be the one laughed
out of the Pentagon.

00:18:22.268 --> 00:18:24.103 align:middle line:90%
>> Paola: Yes.

00:18:24.103 --> 00:18:25.137 align:middle line:90%
And then we had an enemy then.

00:18:25.137 --> 00:18:26.138 align:middle line:90%
We had Russia.

00:18:26.138 --> 00:18:27.640 align:middle line:90%
>> Regina: Right.

00:18:27.640 --> 00:18:29.074 align:middle line:84%
>> Paola: And the excuse was,
we don't want the Russians

00:18:29.074 --> 00:18:30.442 align:middle line:90%
to get it before we --

00:18:30.442 --> 00:18:31.944 align:middle line:84%
now I don't know mentally
[background chuckles] --

00:18:31.944 --> 00:18:34.113 align:middle line:84%
there are going to be
crashes in Russia too.

00:18:34.113 --> 00:18:35.047 align:middle line:90%
What are they thinking?

00:18:35.047 --> 00:18:36.582 align:middle line:90%
>> Regina: And clearly --

00:18:36.582 --> 00:18:37.883 align:middle line:84%
>> Paola: It wasn't just the
United States that had crashes.

00:18:37.883 --> 00:18:39.251 align:middle line:84%
So you're going to have
crashes in Russia also.

00:18:39.251 --> 00:18:40.219 align:middle line:84%
>> Regina: Well and
they're saying --

00:18:40.219 --> 00:18:41.554 align:middle line:90%
and a lot of the Germans --

00:18:41.554 --> 00:18:42.421 align:middle line:84%
the Germans were way
ahead in rocket science --

00:18:42.421 --> 00:18:43.989 align:middle line:90%
>> Paola: That's right.

00:18:43.989 --> 00:18:45.024 align:middle line:84%
>> Regina: They had their own
crashes prior to our crashes.

00:18:45.024 --> 00:18:46.058 align:middle line:90%
>> Paola: That's right.

00:18:46.058 --> 00:18:47.593 align:middle line:84%
>> Regina: Prior
to World War II.

00:18:47.593 --> 00:18:49.495 align:middle line:84%
And we're already developing
this rocket technology there.

00:18:49.495 --> 00:18:50.429 align:middle line:90%
>> Paola: Right.

00:18:50.429 --> 00:18:51.997 align:middle line:90%
>> Regina: Prior to this.

00:18:51.997 --> 00:18:53.299 align:middle line:84%
So I mean why do we think they
only crash in the US [chuckles]?

00:18:53.299 --> 00:18:55.100 align:middle line:90%
>> Paola: I know [chuckles].

00:18:55.100 --> 00:18:57.203 align:middle line:84%
Well also, people were
saying, well if they're

00:18:57.203 --> 00:18:58.504 align:middle line:90%
so advanced why do they crash?

00:18:58.504 --> 00:19:01.707 align:middle line:84%
Well in the case of
the New Mexico --

00:19:01.707 --> 00:19:05.744 align:middle line:84%
and it was New Mexico --
we had very powerful radar.

00:19:05.744 --> 00:19:08.414 align:middle line:84%
Colonel Corso told me that
the radar was so powerful

00:19:08.414 --> 00:19:11.050 align:middle line:84%
that at times he was asked
to shut down his radar

00:19:11.050 --> 00:19:15.254 align:middle line:84%
when he was head of Missile
Battalion in New Mexico.

00:19:15.254 --> 00:19:16.288 align:middle line:84%
He said, "I was asked
certain times

00:19:16.288 --> 00:19:18.824 align:middle line:90%
of the day to shut it down."

00:19:18.824 --> 00:19:20.259 align:middle line:84%
And I thought yeah,
because it brings --

00:19:20.259 --> 00:19:22.328 align:middle line:84%
it interferes with
the navigation --

00:19:22.328 --> 00:19:24.230 align:middle line:90%
>> Regina: I was going to say,

00:19:24.230 --> 00:19:26.999 align:middle line:84%
if those are electromagnetic
gravitational devices,

00:19:26.999 --> 00:19:29.335 align:middle line:84%
of course that kind of pulsing
would totally mess with them.

00:19:29.335 --> 00:19:30.903 align:middle line:90%
>> Paola: Right.

00:19:30.903 --> 00:19:31.871 align:middle line:90%
In those days.

00:19:31.871 --> 00:19:32.605 align:middle line:84%
Yeah. We're talking
in those days.

00:19:32.605 --> 00:19:33.339 align:middle line:90%
>> Regina: Yes.

00:19:33.339 --> 00:19:33.939 align:middle line:90%
In those days.

00:19:33.939 --> 00:19:35.507 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:19:35.507 --> 00:19:36.375 align:middle line:84%
>> Paola: So we're talking
about the history of this,

00:19:36.375 --> 00:19:37.810 align:middle line:90%
which is so interesting.

00:19:37.810 --> 00:19:40.279 align:middle line:84%
I mean any journalist and
anybody that's interested

00:19:40.279 --> 00:19:42.281 align:middle line:84%
in the history of the planet
should be interested in this.

00:19:42.281 --> 00:19:44.283 align:middle line:90%
>> Regina: Absolutely.

00:19:44.283 --> 00:19:46.819 align:middle line:84%
Well if you want to take it
a little further you can go

00:19:46.819 --> 00:19:50.856 align:middle line:84%
into the caves, for example, of
some of the indigenous people

00:19:50.856 --> 00:19:54.426 align:middle line:84%
in -- anywhere really, whether
it's Hopiland, whether it's

00:19:54.426 --> 00:19:57.796 align:middle line:90%
in Australia; parts of Europe.

00:19:57.796 --> 00:20:01.133 align:middle line:84%
And you will find these
depictions of what appear

00:20:01.133 --> 00:20:03.469 align:middle line:90%
to be visitors from outer space.

00:20:03.469 --> 00:20:04.470 align:middle line:84%
All of them with
the enlarged heads.

00:20:04.470 --> 00:20:06.972 align:middle line:90%
Often with the enlarged eyes.

00:20:06.972 --> 00:20:08.641 align:middle line:84%
That's just one particular
kind of visitor.

00:20:08.641 --> 00:20:10.976 align:middle line:84%
Some were very tall
and, you know, thin.

00:20:10.976 --> 00:20:14.079 align:middle line:84%
And we're going to get into this
in a minute because there's --

00:20:14.079 --> 00:20:17.650 align:middle line:84%
that obviously has always been
there, but there was this period

00:20:17.650 --> 00:20:19.785 align:middle line:84%
of time when it wasn't
being done like that.

00:20:19.785 --> 00:20:23.922 align:middle line:84%
And that's what intrigues me
about the Valient Thor story.

00:20:23.922 --> 00:20:25.291 align:middle line:90%
>> Paola: Yeah.

00:20:25.291 --> 00:20:26.458 align:middle line:84%
>> Regina: And I didn't know
who else I could talk to about

00:20:26.458 --> 00:20:27.459 align:middle line:90%
that other than you [chuckles].

00:20:27.459 --> 00:20:29.895 align:middle line:90%
>> Paola: Well they're gone.

00:20:29.895 --> 00:20:33.299 align:middle line:84%
See the problem with the Valient
Thor story, or the contactees

00:20:33.299 --> 00:20:36.335 align:middle line:84%
of the 50s, in America
in particular is

00:20:36.335 --> 00:20:37.903 align:middle line:90%
that they've been dismissed.

00:20:37.903 --> 00:20:40.139 align:middle line:84%
Because what happens
around them, you know,

00:20:40.139 --> 00:20:42.941 align:middle line:84%
waiting for the space
brothers to land,

00:20:42.941 --> 00:20:49.281 align:middle line:84%
is an idea that there's some
kind of fanatical group,

00:20:49.281 --> 00:20:51.083 align:middle line:90%
whatever, around those contacts.

00:20:51.083 --> 00:20:52.751 align:middle line:84%
Although those contacts
were real.

00:20:52.751 --> 00:20:54.920 align:middle line:84%
Otherwise they wouldn't
have made this up.

00:20:54.920 --> 00:20:57.289 align:middle line:90%
And the 50s were very important,

00:20:57.289 --> 00:20:58.490 align:middle line:84%
especially in Southern
California.

00:20:58.490 --> 00:21:01.593 align:middle line:84%
And we're dealing
with Adamski --

00:21:01.593 --> 00:21:03.829 align:middle line:84%
which has been written
off in the United States.

00:21:03.829 --> 00:21:07.733 align:middle line:84%
The Adamski visitations
were real.

00:21:07.733 --> 00:21:12.738 align:middle line:84%
Adamski lived near Mt.
Palomar in San Diego.

00:21:12.738 --> 00:21:17.943 align:middle line:84%
There are witnesses that saw
the craft with Orthon the being,

00:21:17.943 --> 00:21:20.946 align:middle line:84%
you know, the blonde being
that walked off the craft.

00:21:20.946 --> 00:21:23.882 align:middle line:90%
Put his foot down in the sand

00:21:23.882 --> 00:21:26.552 align:middle line:84%
so that George Hunt
Williamson could take a cast

00:21:26.552 --> 00:21:30.022 align:middle line:90%
of his footprint -- of the boot.

00:21:30.022 --> 00:21:31.357 align:middle line:90%
And that's for real.

00:21:31.357 --> 00:21:32.725 align:middle line:84%
That's evidence as
far as I know.

00:21:32.725 --> 00:21:34.193 align:middle line:90%
>> Regina: Mm-hmm.

00:21:34.193 --> 00:21:37.296 align:middle line:84%
>> Paola: And the message
is the same one that appears

00:21:37.296 --> 00:21:40.265 align:middle line:84%
in the movie "The Day
the Earth Stood Still".

00:21:40.265 --> 00:21:41.400 align:middle line:84%
>> Regina: "The Day
the Earth Stood Still".

00:21:41.400 --> 00:21:42.401 align:middle line:90%
Yeah [chuckles].

00:21:42.401 --> 00:21:43.569 align:middle line:90%
>> Paola: People don't realize

00:21:43.569 --> 00:21:45.270 align:middle line:84%
that had some real
backing behind it.

00:21:45.270 --> 00:21:46.705 align:middle line:90%
>> Regina: Yeah.

00:21:46.705 --> 00:21:49.641 align:middle line:84%
>> Paola: That had intelligence
behind that production.

00:21:49.641 --> 00:21:50.576 align:middle line:84%
Yeah. Because -- you know,
and a lot of these --

00:21:50.576 --> 00:21:52.811 align:middle line:90%
and I've read their books.

00:21:52.811 --> 00:21:55.481 align:middle line:84%
Howard Menger's book, and
Adamski --

00:21:55.481 --> 00:21:57.082 align:middle line:90%
I had to go back and read them.

00:21:57.082 --> 00:21:59.585 align:middle line:84%
I don't know how to
encourage people --

00:21:59.585 --> 00:22:00.886 align:middle line:90%
because I'm an educator.

00:22:00.886 --> 00:22:02.421 align:middle line:84%
I just can't guess,
and I'm not going

00:22:02.421 --> 00:22:04.523 align:middle line:90%
on internet second-hand sources.

00:22:04.523 --> 00:22:06.091 align:middle line:84%
So you have to read
the old books.

00:22:06.091 --> 00:22:09.495 align:middle line:84%
Because Adamski and
Desmond Leslie.

00:22:09.495 --> 00:22:12.464 align:middle line:84%
Now Desmond Leslie --
I met him in person

00:22:12.464 --> 00:22:14.600 align:middle line:84%
when Colonel Corso
came to Italy.

00:22:14.600 --> 00:22:20.139 align:middle line:84%
Sir Desmond Leslie was an RAF
pilot who helped write the book,

00:22:20.139 --> 00:22:22.574 align:middle line:84%
"Flying Saucers Have
Landed" with Adamski.

00:22:22.574 --> 00:22:23.542 align:middle line:90%
And he wasn't lying.

00:22:23.542 --> 00:22:25.210 align:middle line:90%
I mean he wrote this book --

00:22:25.210 --> 00:22:26.612 align:middle line:84%
>> Regina: So let's go
back to the message --

00:22:26.612 --> 00:22:28.147 align:middle line:90%
the same message in --

00:22:28.147 --> 00:22:29.681 align:middle line:84%
for if you have not seen "The
Day the Earth Stood Still",

00:22:29.681 --> 00:22:33.152 align:middle line:84%
it is a must for anyone
interested in the subject.

00:22:33.152 --> 00:22:35.587 align:middle line:84%
Absolutely wonderful
movie from the 50s.

00:22:35.587 --> 00:22:37.790 align:middle line:84%
So let's talk about the
message in the movie

00:22:37.790 --> 00:22:40.292 align:middle line:84%
that in fact has been the
message, interestingly,

00:22:40.292 --> 00:22:43.996 align:middle line:84%
of virtually everyone who
claims to have had ET contact.

00:22:43.996 --> 00:22:46.198 align:middle line:84%
>> Paola: Well can I ask you,
how did you like the movie?

00:22:46.198 --> 00:22:48.333 align:middle line:84%
What did you pull
away from the movie?

00:22:48.333 --> 00:22:50.969 align:middle line:84%
>> Regina: Well personally, I
mean I related to the message.

00:22:50.969 --> 00:22:52.538 align:middle line:84%
I've never found any
of it frightening.

00:22:52.538 --> 00:22:53.939 align:middle line:90%
>> Paola: Okay.

00:22:53.939 --> 00:22:55.474 align:middle line:84%
>> Regina: I don't find
these scenarios frightening.

00:22:55.474 --> 00:22:57.509 align:middle line:84%
When people were running scared,
and everything just stopped

00:22:57.509 --> 00:23:00.579 align:middle line:84%
and went into --
basically into a state

00:23:00.579 --> 00:23:03.882 align:middle line:84%
of paralysis while he
delivered his message,

00:23:03.882 --> 00:23:06.552 align:middle line:84%
I personally was
very uplifted by it.

00:23:06.552 --> 00:23:08.420 align:middle line:90%
I didn't find it threatening.

00:23:08.420 --> 00:23:09.621 align:middle line:84%
It's like, the people
need to understand we had

00:23:09.621 --> 00:23:11.757 align:middle line:90%
to take a new look at ourselves;

00:23:11.757 --> 00:23:14.493 align:middle line:84%
a new level of maturity
for the human race.

00:23:14.493 --> 00:23:17.262 align:middle line:84%
And then when we're talking
about the extended messages

00:23:17.262 --> 00:23:19.565 align:middle line:84%
of our planet and
ecosystems and environment,

00:23:19.565 --> 00:23:22.234 align:middle line:90%
who can argue with that?

00:23:22.234 --> 00:23:25.103 align:middle line:84%
We may not agree on some of the
agendas that are out there --

00:23:25.103 --> 00:23:26.872 align:middle line:84%
you know, global
warming and all that --

00:23:26.872 --> 00:23:29.541 align:middle line:84%
but the fact that there
was ecological damage

00:23:29.541 --> 00:23:33.312 align:middle line:84%
that was very solidly underway
by this time -- by the 40s, 50s,

00:23:33.312 --> 00:23:36.548 align:middle line:84%
and 60s -- and we were
being given this kind

00:23:36.548 --> 00:23:39.051 align:middle line:84%
of information from
other sources.

00:23:39.051 --> 00:23:40.986 align:middle line:84%
I think we should have paid
closer attention rather

00:23:40.986 --> 00:23:44.623 align:middle line:84%
than turning it just into
a spooky sci-fi scenario.

00:23:44.623 --> 00:23:45.791 align:middle line:90%
>> Paola: Well we can talk

00:23:45.791 --> 00:23:48.060 align:middle line:84%
about Hollywood forever,
but you know --

00:23:48.060 --> 00:23:49.561 align:middle line:90%
>> Regina: Well Hollywood --

00:23:49.561 --> 00:23:51.897 align:middle line:84%
a lot of major players in
Hollywood were very well aware

00:23:51.897 --> 00:23:53.599 align:middle line:84%
of this, and you
know who they were.

00:23:53.599 --> 00:23:58.370 align:middle line:84%
But let's -- again the
message was from --

00:23:58.370 --> 00:23:59.838 align:middle line:90%
before we get to Val Thor --

00:23:59.838 --> 00:24:01.607 align:middle line:84%
because I mean Val Thor was
basically giving the same

00:24:01.607 --> 00:24:02.541 align:middle line:90%
message [chuckles].

00:24:02.541 --> 00:24:03.942 align:middle line:90%
>> Paola: [Chuckles] yeah.

00:24:03.942 --> 00:24:06.144 align:middle line:84%
>> Regina: In fact, when
these events were occurring

00:24:06.144 --> 00:24:08.514 align:middle line:84%
in Southern California out
in the desert, there were --

00:24:08.514 --> 00:24:12.384 align:middle line:84%
let's talk about the stars
who were aware of it.

00:24:12.384 --> 00:24:13.585 align:middle line:90%
>> Paola: Okay.

00:24:13.585 --> 00:24:16.054 align:middle line:84%
Well, I think that
first of all the --

00:24:16.054 --> 00:24:19.057 align:middle line:84%
George Van Tassel was
probably the most important

00:24:19.057 --> 00:24:20.459 align:middle line:90%
for people to study first.

00:24:20.459 --> 00:24:24.463 align:middle line:84%
George Van Tassel had leased
an airport near Landers,

00:24:24.463 --> 00:24:26.064 align:middle line:90%
California.

00:24:26.064 --> 00:24:29.334 align:middle line:84%
And there right in that area
which we call Giant Rock.

00:24:29.334 --> 00:24:32.070 align:middle line:84%
But Giant Rock a rock that
is split, but it happened

00:24:32.070 --> 00:24:34.640 align:middle line:84%
to be a Native American,
spiritual --

00:24:34.640 --> 00:24:36.275 align:middle line:90%
>> Regina: Giant rock.

00:24:36.275 --> 00:24:37.109 align:middle line:90%
>> Paola: Yeah.

00:24:37.109 --> 00:24:39.244 align:middle line:90%
It was a Native American site.

00:24:39.244 --> 00:24:40.279 align:middle line:90%
>> Regina: Yeah.

00:24:40.279 --> 00:24:41.713 align:middle line:84%
>> Paola: Because
Native Americans --

00:24:41.713 --> 00:24:43.582 align:middle line:84%
if you study and start
connecting the dots.

00:24:43.582 --> 00:24:44.616 align:middle line:84%
>> Regina: Well they
have connections

00:24:44.616 --> 00:24:46.318 align:middle line:90%
with the star people.

00:24:46.318 --> 00:24:46.952 align:middle line:90%
>> Paola: That's right.

00:24:46.952 --> 00:24:48.120 align:middle line:90%
>> Regina: Right.

00:24:48.120 --> 00:24:49.821 align:middle line:84%
>> Paola: And also
with the esoteric.

00:24:49.821 --> 00:24:51.023 align:middle line:90%
>> Regina: Yes.

00:24:51.023 --> 00:24:52.558 align:middle line:84%
>> Paola: With dimensional
phenomenon.

00:24:52.558 --> 00:24:57.329 align:middle line:84%
And when we talk about UFOs
or sightings, let's call it --

00:24:57.329 --> 00:25:01.300 align:middle line:84%
as John Keel called it,
dimensional phenomenon.

00:25:01.300 --> 00:25:02.668 align:middle line:90%
>> Regina: Yes.

00:25:02.668 --> 00:25:05.737 align:middle line:84%
>> Paola: So George Van Tassel
had leased the airport there

00:25:05.737 --> 00:25:09.975 align:middle line:84%
near Giant Rock, and one day
while he was sleeping outside

00:25:09.975 --> 00:25:11.910 align:middle line:90%
in that area, a craft landed.

00:25:11.910 --> 00:25:13.245 align:middle line:90%
A man came out.

00:25:13.245 --> 00:25:16.381 align:middle line:84%
Walked over to George
Van Tassel and said,

00:25:16.381 --> 00:25:18.417 align:middle line:84%
"Would you like to come
aboard and see the craft?"

00:25:18.417 --> 00:25:19.851 align:middle line:90%
And he went aboard.

00:25:19.851 --> 00:25:23.355 align:middle line:84%
And from that point on, he
received the same message

00:25:23.355 --> 00:25:27.359 align:middle line:84%
that contemporarily
Howard Menger,

00:25:27.359 --> 00:25:30.896 align:middle line:84%
who lived in High Bridge, New
Jersey received when he went

00:25:30.896 --> 00:25:33.932 align:middle line:84%
into the forest behind
his home in High Bridge,

00:25:33.932 --> 00:25:37.002 align:middle line:84%
and this craft landed and
these blonde people came out.

00:25:37.002 --> 00:25:38.537 align:middle line:90%
And they said the same thing.

00:25:38.537 --> 00:25:42.307 align:middle line:84%
They said, "In California, we
want you to meet the people

00:25:42.307 --> 00:25:43.108 align:middle line:90%
that are working there."

00:25:43.108 --> 00:25:44.710 align:middle line:90%
And these are human aliens.

00:25:44.710 --> 00:25:46.011 align:middle line:90%
They're people --

00:25:46.011 --> 00:25:47.446 align:middle line:84%
>> Regina: That's why
we're bringing this up.

00:25:47.446 --> 00:25:48.947 align:middle line:90%
>> Paola: Yeah.

00:25:48.947 --> 00:25:49.815 align:middle line:84%
>> Regina: Just like in "The
Day the Earth Stood Still".

00:25:49.815 --> 00:25:50.549 align:middle line:90%
>> Paola: Well yeah --

00:25:50.549 --> 00:25:51.984 align:middle line:90%
>> Regina: Yeah.

00:25:51.984 --> 00:25:53.185 align:middle line:84%
>> Paola: -- they're human
and I mean human looking.

00:25:53.185 --> 00:25:54.853 align:middle line:84%
They're -- but it's
really interesting

00:25:54.853 --> 00:25:56.755 align:middle line:84%
because the Menger book
for me is fascinating.

00:25:56.755 --> 00:25:59.891 align:middle line:84%
>> Regina: What is the
name of the Menger book?

00:25:59.891 --> 00:26:01.793 align:middle line:84%
>> Paola: "From Outer
Space to You".

00:26:01.793 --> 00:26:03.028 align:middle line:90%
>> Regina: Okay.

00:26:03.028 --> 00:26:04.329 align:middle line:84%
>> Paola: And the
thing is, that the --

00:26:04.329 --> 00:26:07.332 align:middle line:84%
Howard said that when he
went to see them, he --

00:26:07.332 --> 00:26:08.667 align:middle line:84%
they asked that he --
they cut their hair.

00:26:08.667 --> 00:26:10.636 align:middle line:90%
That he cut their hair.

00:26:10.636 --> 00:26:11.903 align:middle line:84%
Because it wasn't the hippie
movement yet [chuckles] --

00:26:11.903 --> 00:26:12.571 align:middle line:90%
>> Regina: Right.

00:26:12.571 --> 00:26:13.372 align:middle line:90%
Right.

00:26:13.372 --> 00:26:14.206 align:middle line:90%
>> Paola: -- okay?

00:26:14.206 --> 00:26:15.674 align:middle line:90%
So they had long, blonde hair.

00:26:15.674 --> 00:26:17.876 align:middle line:84%
And he would cut the hair
for them, and he also says,

00:26:17.876 --> 00:26:20.078 align:middle line:84%
"I didn't keep any of
it out of respect."

00:26:20.078 --> 00:26:21.913 align:middle line:90%
But he also gave them clothes.

00:26:21.913 --> 00:26:24.483 align:middle line:84%
Which meant that they
could mix around the people

00:26:24.483 --> 00:26:25.651 align:middle line:90%
in the New Jersey area.

00:26:25.651 --> 00:26:28.854 align:middle line:84%
And in the context
that he had there,

00:26:28.854 --> 00:26:32.090 align:middle line:90%
he began to relay their message.

00:26:32.090 --> 00:26:34.826 align:middle line:84%
And the message is the one that
you've been talking about, okay?

00:26:34.826 --> 00:26:36.928 align:middle line:90%
>> Regina: Yes.

00:26:36.928 --> 00:26:38.163 align:middle line:84%
>> Paola: The message is,
"Watch what you're doing.

00:26:38.163 --> 00:26:40.332 align:middle line:84%
Your technology is
out of control.

00:26:40.332 --> 00:26:43.435 align:middle line:84%
Unless you evolve
spiritually -- "

00:26:43.435 --> 00:26:44.703 align:middle line:90%
>> Regina: That's right.

00:26:44.703 --> 00:26:46.104 align:middle line:84%
>> Paola: "-- with the
technology, you're going to have

00:26:46.104 --> 00:26:49.174 align:middle line:84%
such a huge imbalance
that there's going

00:26:49.174 --> 00:26:50.942 align:middle line:90%
to be tragedy on this planet."

00:26:50.942 --> 00:26:52.411 align:middle line:84%
>> Regina: Well it's
happening right now.

00:26:52.411 --> 00:26:55.347 align:middle line:84%
I mean if you look at a map
of the nuclear explosions

00:26:55.347 --> 00:26:57.582 align:middle line:84%
that started happening
from that time forward --

00:26:57.582 --> 00:27:01.753 align:middle line:84%
from the 40s forward -- in fast
motion, it's pretty shocking.

00:27:01.753 --> 00:27:05.557 align:middle line:84%
When you see the
animations, boom!

00:27:05.557 --> 00:27:06.525 align:middle line:90%
Boom! Year-by-year --

00:27:06.525 --> 00:27:07.325 align:middle line:90%
>> Paola: Right.

00:27:07.325 --> 00:27:08.727 align:middle line:90%
>> Regina: -- pop!

00:27:08.727 --> 00:27:11.329 align:middle line:84%
Pop! All over the world and the
oceans, these were atomic blasts

00:27:11.329 --> 00:27:14.266 align:middle line:84%
that were happening,
already poisoning the seas

00:27:14.266 --> 00:27:16.201 align:middle line:90%
and the lands and the so forth.

00:27:16.201 --> 00:27:18.437 align:middle line:84%
And now you look at
the accident of --

00:27:18.437 --> 00:27:20.572 align:middle line:84%
well Chernobyl first
and now Fukushima --

00:27:20.572 --> 00:27:21.873 align:middle line:90%
>> Paola: Right, Fukushima.

00:27:21.873 --> 00:27:23.542 align:middle line:84%
>> Regina: -- which is
no end in sight on that.

00:27:23.542 --> 00:27:24.910 align:middle line:90%
They were right.

00:27:24.910 --> 00:27:26.678 align:middle line:84%
>> Paola: They were right,
and it's not on America.

00:27:26.678 --> 00:27:27.679 align:middle line:90%
It was India and France --

00:27:27.679 --> 00:27:28.914 align:middle line:90%
>> Regina: It was everywhere.

00:27:28.914 --> 00:27:31.950 align:middle line:84%
>> Paola: France did
800 H Bomb tests --

00:27:31.950 --> 00:27:33.051 align:middle line:90%
>> Regina: Yeah.

00:27:33.051 --> 00:27:34.052 align:middle line:84%
>> Paola: -- off
the Bikini Atoll.

00:27:34.052 --> 00:27:34.986 align:middle line:90%
I don't know why we need 800.

00:27:34.986 --> 00:27:36.555 align:middle line:90%
>> Regina: Yes.

00:27:36.555 --> 00:27:38.356 align:middle line:84%
>> Paola: Because I interviewed
someone that was present there,

00:27:38.356 --> 00:27:41.059 align:middle line:84%
and he told me that -- about
the flyovers of the UFOs.

00:27:41.059 --> 00:27:42.728 align:middle line:84%
He said they never did anything,
but they would fly over.

00:27:42.728 --> 00:27:48.200 align:middle line:84%
So I really have talked to
a lot of military personnel

00:27:48.200 --> 00:27:49.634 align:middle line:84%
who were present
during this time.

00:27:49.634 --> 00:27:50.936 align:middle line:90%
They know.

00:27:50.936 --> 00:27:53.638 align:middle line:84%
It's just that I think
we've got out of control

00:27:53.638 --> 00:27:56.174 align:middle line:90%
and there's a certain insanity

00:27:56.174 --> 00:27:59.010 align:middle line:84%
about the way we do
things on this planet.

00:27:59.010 --> 00:28:01.246 align:middle line:84%
I don't know how the
beings are judging us

00:28:01.246 --> 00:28:03.815 align:middle line:84%
because it isn't
making any sense.

00:28:03.815 --> 00:28:04.516 align:middle line:90%
>> Regina: No.

00:28:04.516 --> 00:28:05.617 align:middle line:90%
No it's not.

00:28:05.617 --> 00:28:07.252 align:middle line:84%
Especially if you've
had any kinds of heads

00:28:07.252 --> 00:28:09.521 align:middle line:84%
up about exactly what was
going to happen and we have,

00:28:09.521 --> 00:28:10.889 align:middle line:90%
including the military.

00:28:10.889 --> 00:28:15.427 align:middle line:84%
So let's start -- let's move
into Val Thor -- Valient Thor.

00:28:15.427 --> 00:28:16.228 align:middle line:90%
>> Paola: Well --

00:28:16.228 --> 00:28:16.962 align:middle line:90%
>> Regina: And these beings.

00:28:16.962 --> 00:28:17.763 align:middle line:90%
Tell the story.

00:28:17.763 --> 00:28:18.764 align:middle line:90%
How they arrived.

00:28:18.764 --> 00:28:19.731 align:middle line:90%
How he ended up at the Pentagon.

00:28:19.731 --> 00:28:20.832 align:middle line:90%
Who he was in contact with.

00:28:20.832 --> 00:28:22.100 align:middle line:90%
Tell us the story.

00:28:22.100 --> 00:28:24.736 align:middle line:84%
>> Paola: Well I put
the pictures of Val Thor

00:28:24.736 --> 00:28:27.939 align:middle line:84%
on my Facebook and had
like an incredible amount

00:28:27.939 --> 00:28:30.242 align:middle line:90%
of [chuckles] people interested.

00:28:30.242 --> 00:28:31.743 align:middle line:84%
And what had happened,
those pictures that are

00:28:31.743 --> 00:28:36.381 align:middle line:84%
on Facebook are a result of
a lecture that Howard Menger

00:28:36.381 --> 00:28:40.285 align:middle line:84%
and his first wife, Rose, had
at High Bridge in New Jersey.

00:28:40.285 --> 00:28:42.954 align:middle line:84%
And I have the audio
tapes of the photographer

00:28:42.954 --> 00:28:46.158 align:middle line:84%
who took Val Thor and
his two friends pictures.

00:28:46.158 --> 00:28:48.960 align:middle line:84%
>> Regina: And he's the very
handsome one with the dark hair.

00:28:48.960 --> 00:28:50.529 align:middle line:90%
>> Paola: Yeah.

00:28:50.529 --> 00:28:51.596 align:middle line:84%
>> Regina: And he's with this
beautiful blonde woman, his --

00:28:51.596 --> 00:28:52.297 align:middle line:90%
>> Paola: Named Jill.

00:28:52.297 --> 00:28:53.465 align:middle line:90%
>> Regina: Named Jill.

00:28:53.465 --> 00:28:54.633 align:middle line:84%
And what was his
other -- the other --

00:28:54.633 --> 00:28:55.467 align:middle line:90%
>> Paola: That's his brother.

00:28:55.467 --> 00:28:56.701 align:middle line:90%
That's his brother.

00:28:56.701 --> 00:28:58.436 align:middle line:84%
>> Regina: -- male companion
-- that's his brother?

00:28:58.436 --> 00:28:59.571 align:middle line:84%
>> Paola: It's -- his name is
Donn, but it's spelled D-O-N-N.

00:28:59.571 --> 00:29:00.405 align:middle line:90%
>> Regina: D-O-N-N.

00:29:00.405 --> 00:29:02.207 align:middle line:90%
All very beautiful human beings.

00:29:02.207 --> 00:29:02.808 align:middle line:90%
>> Paola: People.

00:29:02.808 --> 00:29:04.009 align:middle line:90%
So --

00:29:04.009 --> 00:29:05.243 align:middle line:84%
>> Regina: Well, or
not [chuckles] --

00:29:05.243 --> 00:29:06.778 align:middle line:84%
>> Paola: I saw the
-- I saw the picture

00:29:06.778 --> 00:29:10.182 align:middle line:84%
and from the Wendell Steven's
archive, one of my friends,

00:29:10.182 --> 00:29:12.751 align:middle line:84%
Joe Fex had purchased
the Wendell Steven's archive,

00:29:12.751 --> 00:29:16.922 align:middle line:84%
and he let me hear the
tape of the photographer

00:29:16.922 --> 00:29:18.957 align:middle line:84%
and how the photographer
reacted to them.

00:29:18.957 --> 00:29:23.261 align:middle line:84%
Because there was the lecture
in High Bridge, New Jersey.

00:29:23.261 --> 00:29:26.631 align:middle line:84%
There was Menger who's
talking with his wife, Rose,

00:29:26.631 --> 00:29:28.500 align:middle line:84%
and all these people -- and
you'll see in the photograph --

00:29:28.500 --> 00:29:31.937 align:middle line:84%
of all the people at the --
they were on his property.

00:29:31.937 --> 00:29:34.005 align:middle line:90%
>> Regina: Yes.

00:29:34.005 --> 00:29:35.540 align:middle line:84%
>> Paola: And the photographer
was told that there were going

00:29:35.540 --> 00:29:39.044 align:middle line:84%
to be three beings that
were not from this planet.

00:29:39.044 --> 00:29:40.979 align:middle line:84%
And he had to guess
which ones they were.

00:29:40.979 --> 00:29:42.848 align:middle line:84%
He was not told where
they were sitting.

00:29:42.848 --> 00:29:45.884 align:middle line:84%
He was not told who they
were [background chuckles].

00:29:45.884 --> 00:29:48.553 align:middle line:90%
So there are about 100 pictures

00:29:48.553 --> 00:29:51.256 align:middle line:84%
that August Roberts
took that day.

00:29:51.256 --> 00:29:52.657 align:middle line:90%
>> Regina: Yes.

00:29:52.657 --> 00:29:54.392 align:middle line:84%
>> Paola: And I've heard
August Roberts voice saying,

00:29:54.392 --> 00:29:56.161 align:middle line:84%
"Well these three
were sitting there,

00:29:56.161 --> 00:29:57.295 align:middle line:84%
and they had a whole
different vibration.

00:29:57.295 --> 00:29:58.864 align:middle line:84%
And people were very
fascinated -- "

00:29:58.864 --> 00:30:01.666 align:middle line:84%
>> Regina: Yeah and you can see
in the background of the photo

00:30:01.666 --> 00:30:03.802 align:middle line:84%
that people are looking at them
out of the corner of their eye.

00:30:03.802 --> 00:30:06.471 align:middle line:84%
They're very fascinated
with these people --

00:30:06.471 --> 00:30:07.272 align:middle line:90%
>> Paola: Yeah.

00:30:07.272 --> 00:30:08.139 align:middle line:90%
>> Regina: -- these beings.

00:30:08.139 --> 00:30:09.541 align:middle line:90%
>> Paola: These beings.

00:30:09.541 --> 00:30:10.508 align:middle line:84%
And he said, "They reminded
me of Hollywood actors."

00:30:10.508 --> 00:30:11.643 align:middle line:90%
>> Regina: Right.

00:30:11.643 --> 00:30:13.111 align:middle line:84%
>> Paola: That's what
the photographer said.

00:30:13.111 --> 00:30:15.981 align:middle line:84%
So he said, "Subtly, I
took pictures of them

00:30:15.981 --> 00:30:18.250 align:middle line:90%
so they would not be disturbed.

00:30:18.250 --> 00:30:20.852 align:middle line:84%
And I did not go up to them,
but I took these photos."

00:30:20.852 --> 00:30:23.822 align:middle line:84%
Now these photos are historic
because the one gentleman

00:30:23.822 --> 00:30:27.058 align:middle line:84%
that is sitting on the
outside that has all the pads

00:30:27.058 --> 00:30:30.662 align:middle line:90%
of paper there, is Valient Thor.

00:30:30.662 --> 00:30:34.466 align:middle line:84%
And the story of Valient Thor
comes through a book called,

00:30:34.466 --> 00:30:37.736 align:middle line:84%
"Stranger in the Pentagon"
by Frank Stranges --

00:30:37.736 --> 00:30:38.670 align:middle line:90%
>> Regina: Frank Stranges.

00:30:38.670 --> 00:30:39.804 align:middle line:90%
>> Paola: Frank Stranges.

00:30:39.804 --> 00:30:42.774 align:middle line:84%
Who gives his account
of being at the Pentagon

00:30:42.774 --> 00:30:44.409 align:middle line:90%
and meeting this gentleman --

00:30:44.409 --> 00:30:47.212 align:middle line:84%
this very handsome
gentleman named Valient Thor.

00:30:47.212 --> 00:30:49.247 align:middle line:90%
Valient knew Frank's name.

00:30:49.247 --> 00:30:51.449 align:middle line:90%
He went to shake hands with him

00:30:51.449 --> 00:30:54.119 align:middle line:84%
and Frank said he didn't
have any fingerprints.

00:30:54.119 --> 00:30:57.489 align:middle line:84%
And his -- he says his
skin was like baby skin.

00:30:57.489 --> 00:30:59.925 align:middle line:90%
And he also found out later

00:30:59.925 --> 00:31:01.927 align:middle line:84%
on that he didn't
have a bellybutton.

00:31:01.927 --> 00:31:02.894 align:middle line:90%
>> Regina: No umbilical --

00:31:02.894 --> 00:31:04.162 align:middle line:90%
>> Paola: He didn't have --

00:31:04.162 --> 00:31:04.896 align:middle line:84%
>> Regina: No need for
an umbilical chord.

00:31:04.896 --> 00:31:06.464 align:middle line:90%
>> Paola: No.

00:31:06.464 --> 00:31:10.368 align:middle line:84%
And that what Val had told him
was that they had a mother ship

00:31:10.368 --> 00:31:13.171 align:middle line:84%
that was cloaked on
Lake Meade, near Nevada.

00:31:13.171 --> 00:31:17.475 align:middle line:84%
And that there were
a lot of his people.

00:31:17.475 --> 00:31:21.413 align:middle line:84%
Now he said he was
at the Pentagon there

00:31:21.413 --> 00:31:25.750 align:middle line:90%
to talk to the military.

00:31:25.750 --> 00:31:28.553 align:middle line:84%
To explain -- to -- there
had to be a little bit

00:31:28.553 --> 00:31:32.257 align:middle line:84%
of a technology exchange because
in every story I've ever done

00:31:32.257 --> 00:31:35.093 align:middle line:84%
that has any kind of
extraterrestrials involved,

00:31:35.093 --> 00:31:36.995 align:middle line:84%
they're -- you don't get
something for nothing.

00:31:36.995 --> 00:31:39.431 align:middle line:90%
You know? They give you --

00:31:39.431 --> 00:31:42.100 align:middle line:84%
they will talk to you or they
will have a technology exchange,

00:31:42.100 --> 00:31:45.303 align:middle line:84%
or that's why they're
here and so forth.

00:31:45.303 --> 00:31:49.674 align:middle line:84%
So I think Val made
an attempt in the 50s.

00:31:49.674 --> 00:31:52.477 align:middle line:84%
And I really do believe
that at that time --

00:31:52.477 --> 00:31:54.179 align:middle line:84%
because you've got to
look at who was President.

00:31:54.179 --> 00:31:56.281 align:middle line:90%
There was Eisenhower and Nixon.

00:31:56.281 --> 00:31:57.816 align:middle line:90%
>> Regina: And he was aware.

00:31:57.816 --> 00:31:58.917 align:middle line:90%
>> Paola: He was aware already

00:31:58.917 --> 00:32:01.119 align:middle line:84%
because of the Holloman
landing in the 50s.

00:32:01.119 --> 00:32:02.320 align:middle line:90%
>> Regina: Yes.

00:32:02.320 --> 00:32:03.321 align:middle line:84%
>> Paola: Which I
believe did happen.

00:32:03.321 --> 00:32:06.424 align:middle line:90%
There's film footage of that.

00:32:06.424 --> 00:32:08.159 align:middle line:84%
And those beings
that came off --

00:32:08.159 --> 00:32:09.728 align:middle line:90%
I want to be clear about this --

00:32:09.728 --> 00:32:13.698 align:middle line:84%
that came off the craft there
during the Holloman landing were

00:32:13.698 --> 00:32:14.632 align:middle line:90%
not Grays.

00:32:14.632 --> 00:32:15.266 align:middle line:90%
They were people.

00:32:15.266 --> 00:32:15.867 align:middle line:90%
>> Regina: Right.

00:32:15.867 --> 00:32:16.801 align:middle line:90%
Right.

00:32:16.801 --> 00:32:18.203 align:middle line:90%
>> Paola: And they also --

00:32:18.203 --> 00:32:21.406 align:middle line:84%
what they had said to Eisenhower
was look, you know, you're going

00:32:21.406 --> 00:32:22.640 align:middle line:90%
in a dangerous direction.

00:32:22.640 --> 00:32:24.909 align:middle line:84%
Could you please be
careful with the use

00:32:24.909 --> 00:32:25.910 align:middle line:90%
of nuclear on this planet.

00:32:25.910 --> 00:32:27.779 align:middle line:90%
You could destroy yourselves.

00:32:27.779 --> 00:32:28.980 align:middle line:90%
>> Regina: Yes.

00:32:28.980 --> 00:32:30.949 align:middle line:84%
>> Paola: And he responded,
"My hands are tied.

00:32:30.949 --> 00:32:33.885 align:middle line:84%
It is now in the military
industrial complex."

00:32:33.885 --> 00:32:35.320 align:middle line:90%
>> Regina: That's right.

00:32:35.320 --> 00:32:37.889 align:middle line:84%
>> Paola: And two speeches
he made just before he --

00:32:37.889 --> 00:32:38.723 align:middle line:90%
>> Regina: "Beware".

00:32:38.723 --> 00:32:39.391 align:middle line:90%
>> Paola: "Beware".

00:32:39.391 --> 00:32:40.759 align:middle line:90%
I can't do anything.

00:32:40.759 --> 00:32:43.661 align:middle line:84%
When you talk to all the
politicians and the people

00:32:43.661 --> 00:32:46.331 align:middle line:84%
in power today they'll
tell you the same thing.

00:32:46.331 --> 00:32:47.132 align:middle line:84%
I can't do a darn
thing about it.

00:32:47.132 --> 00:32:49.868 align:middle line:90%
It is deep black.

00:32:49.868 --> 00:32:51.870 align:middle line:84%
It's in the military
industrial complex.

00:32:51.870 --> 00:32:55.707 align:middle line:84%
Which means that it has to
do, not only with economics,

00:32:55.707 --> 00:32:59.144 align:middle line:84%
but control of the
planet's energy systems.

00:32:59.144 --> 00:33:01.980 align:middle line:84%
So we've got, you know, because
I mean if we had this kind

00:33:01.980 --> 00:33:05.316 align:middle line:84%
of technology [chuckles]
it would be a game changer

00:33:05.316 --> 00:33:06.851 align:middle line:90%
like totally.

00:33:06.851 --> 00:33:10.155 align:middle line:84%
And that is why Paul Hollier
has been very active.

00:33:10.155 --> 00:33:11.623 align:middle line:90%
And he's 90 years old.

00:33:11.623 --> 00:33:14.793 align:middle line:84%
Speaking at these
conferences and speaking

00:33:14.793 --> 00:33:15.927 align:middle line:90%
at the Citizen Hearing.

00:33:15.927 --> 00:33:17.128 align:middle line:90%
>> Regina: Yes.

00:33:17.128 --> 00:33:17.929 align:middle line:84%
>> Paola: For people
to pay attention.

00:33:17.929 --> 00:33:18.930 align:middle line:90%
>> Regina: Right.

00:33:18.930 --> 00:33:19.664 align:middle line:90%
Steven Bassets at that event --

00:33:19.664 --> 00:33:20.498 align:middle line:90%
>> Paola: Right.

00:33:20.498 --> 00:33:21.066 align:middle line:90%
>> Regina: -- Washington, DC.

00:33:21.066 --> 00:33:21.933 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

00:33:21.933 --> 00:33:22.667 align:middle line:90%
>> Paola: He was there.

00:33:22.667 --> 00:33:23.635 align:middle line:90%
>> Regina: Yes.

00:33:23.635 --> 00:33:25.036 align:middle line:84%
>> Paola: And he
said, "Pay attention

00:33:25.036 --> 00:33:26.204 align:middle line:84%
because you have the ability
to change the paradigm."

00:33:26.204 --> 00:33:29.274 align:middle line:90%
And I think eventually it will.

00:33:29.274 --> 00:33:32.577 align:middle line:84%
I think whoever's --
who has this technology

00:33:32.577 --> 00:33:36.047 align:middle line:84%
and whoever is doing the
micromanaging will realize

00:33:36.047 --> 00:33:39.117 align:middle line:84%
that unless it gets changed,
there will be no world

00:33:39.117 --> 00:33:40.652 align:middle line:84%
for our children's
children's children.

00:33:40.652 --> 00:33:43.221 align:middle line:84%
>> Regina: And that's the ET
message has essentially been now

00:33:43.221 --> 00:33:46.458 align:middle line:90%
for 6 decades -- 7 decades.

00:33:46.458 --> 00:33:48.393 align:middle line:90%
And going back to Val Thor.

00:33:48.393 --> 00:33:50.995 align:middle line:84%
It's interesting because
when you speak to people

00:33:50.995 --> 00:33:54.466 align:middle line:84%
that study extraterrestrials
and the connection

00:33:54.466 --> 00:33:56.167 align:middle line:90%
with Venus -- and he said --

00:33:56.167 --> 00:33:57.435 align:middle line:90%
>> Paola: Yeah.

00:33:57.435 --> 00:33:58.970 align:middle line:84%
>> Regina: -- that they
had come from Venus.

00:33:58.970 --> 00:34:01.873 align:middle line:84%
>> Paola: Well, not only he,
but Menger said that the blondes

00:34:01.873 --> 00:34:03.274 align:middle line:90%
that came off his craft --

00:34:03.274 --> 00:34:04.642 align:middle line:90%
>> Regina: Yes.

00:34:04.642 --> 00:34:05.410 align:middle line:84%
>> Paola: -- had said
they were from Venus too.

00:34:05.410 --> 00:34:06.578 align:middle line:90%
>> Regina: Yes.

00:34:06.578 --> 00:34:08.012 align:middle line:84%
And that is significant
because people

00:34:08.012 --> 00:34:11.516 align:middle line:84%
who research this field
always talk about how gracious

00:34:11.516 --> 00:34:15.253 align:middle line:84%
and beautiful, and how high
the energy is about the beings

00:34:15.253 --> 00:34:17.155 align:middle line:84%
that succumb -- that
come through from Venus.

00:34:17.155 --> 00:34:19.023 align:middle line:90%
And this gets

00:34:19.023 --> 00:34:20.224 align:middle line:84%
into a conversation I was
having the other day with

00:34:20.224 --> 00:34:22.193 align:middle line:90%
Drumbelow.

00:34:22.193 --> 00:34:24.195 align:middle line:84%
And I -- we were
talking about --

00:34:24.195 --> 00:34:27.465 align:middle line:90%
in fact we got -- I recorded it.

00:34:27.465 --> 00:34:29.934 align:middle line:90%
Talking about his process

00:34:29.934 --> 00:34:33.003 align:middle line:84%
of becoming a walk-in
into a human form.

00:34:33.003 --> 00:34:39.010 align:middle line:84%
And he explained this
intricate process that happens,

00:34:39.010 --> 00:34:40.712 align:middle line:90%
a kind of a step-down process

00:34:40.712 --> 00:34:43.581 align:middle line:84%
from whichever dimensional
field a person's from.

00:34:43.581 --> 00:34:47.152 align:middle line:84%
They're bringing through this
high intention; this high energy

00:34:47.152 --> 00:34:48.286 align:middle line:90%
from another dimensional field.

00:34:48.286 --> 00:34:50.255 align:middle line:84%
And we think you
can just kind of pop

00:34:50.255 --> 00:34:54.425 align:middle line:84%
in to physical reality
with no issues.

00:34:54.425 --> 00:34:56.761 align:middle line:84%
And in fact, the ones
that did come, he said,

00:34:56.761 --> 00:34:59.364 align:middle line:84%
went through the process of
coming through -- in his case --

00:34:59.364 --> 00:35:01.933 align:middle line:90%
the crab nebula behind Orion.

00:35:01.933 --> 00:35:06.237 align:middle line:84%
And then going in through
Sirius and the final stop was --

00:35:06.237 --> 00:35:08.806 align:middle line:90%
and then the pleiades.

00:35:08.806 --> 00:35:11.142 align:middle line:84%
And then the final
process of densification

00:35:11.142 --> 00:35:14.813 align:middle line:84%
into physicality -- stepping
down into physicality

00:35:14.813 --> 00:35:17.582 align:middle line:84%
in these lower dimensional
fields was Venus.

00:35:17.582 --> 00:35:19.984 align:middle line:84%
So when I was thinking
of Val Thor

00:35:19.984 --> 00:35:21.653 align:middle line:84%
and these beautiful
beings, I was flashing back.

00:35:21.653 --> 00:35:25.323 align:middle line:84%
He said this was the normal
process for beings who came

00:35:25.323 --> 00:35:27.692 align:middle line:90%
to work with those on Earth.

00:35:27.692 --> 00:35:30.161 align:middle line:84%
Was ending up coming -- and
I hadn't heard that before.

00:35:30.161 --> 00:35:32.630 align:middle line:84%
Coming through Venus
to the Earth.

00:35:32.630 --> 00:35:34.465 align:middle line:84%
>> Paola: And it
wasn't just in America.

00:35:34.465 --> 00:35:37.936 align:middle line:84%
Your story's real interesting
because Venus appears

00:35:37.936 --> 00:35:39.437 align:middle line:90%
to be the logical place.

00:35:39.437 --> 00:35:44.709 align:middle line:84%
But in the 1950s -- 1956 --
Lugenia Cidacuza,

00:35:44.709 --> 00:35:48.479 align:middle line:84%
who was on the island of Sicily,
who was the Adamski of Italy --

00:35:48.479 --> 00:35:50.381 align:middle line:84%
everybody in Italy
knows Lugenia Cidacuza.

00:35:50.381 --> 00:35:53.718 align:middle line:84%
He also met these
blonde people who came

00:35:53.718 --> 00:35:55.453 align:middle line:90%
and gave him the same message.

00:35:55.453 --> 00:35:57.288 align:middle line:84%
And they said they
came from Venus.

00:35:57.288 --> 00:35:59.290 align:middle line:90%
>> Regina: Okay.

00:35:59.290 --> 00:36:01.893 align:middle line:84%
So there might -- and not
only that, when we're looking

00:36:01.893 --> 00:36:06.831 align:middle line:84%
at those particular planetary
systems, Orion, Sirius,

00:36:06.831 --> 00:36:13.571 align:middle line:84%
the Pleiades, all of that goes
deep into Egyptian studies.

00:36:13.571 --> 00:36:16.107 align:middle line:90%
And beyond Atlantaen studies.

00:36:16.107 --> 00:36:18.643 align:middle line:84%
There was a very close
tie between these places.

00:36:18.643 --> 00:36:21.579 align:middle line:84%
And from the Dogon
tribe out of Africa.

00:36:21.579 --> 00:36:23.615 align:middle line:84%
The very deep connection
with Sirius.

00:36:23.615 --> 00:36:27.085 align:middle line:84%
So everything he
said were the planets

00:36:27.085 --> 00:36:30.154 align:middle line:84%
that have commonly been either
depicted, or talked about,

00:36:30.154 --> 00:36:34.859 align:middle line:84%
or embedded in lore throughout
history for the human species.

00:36:34.859 --> 00:36:37.495 align:middle line:84%
So there has to be some
connection going on there.

00:36:37.495 --> 00:36:38.863 align:middle line:90%
>> Paola: Yeah I believe that.

00:36:38.863 --> 00:36:40.965 align:middle line:84%
And I also believe that
they probably called Venus

00:36:40.965 --> 00:36:41.599 align:middle line:90%
something different.

00:36:41.599 --> 00:36:43.034 align:middle line:90%
>> Regina: Right.

00:36:43.034 --> 00:36:44.569 align:middle line:84%
>> Paola: Because the problem
that the beings have --

00:36:44.569 --> 00:36:46.204 align:middle line:84%
I mean I did another case,
the Charles Hall case --

00:36:46.204 --> 00:36:49.107 align:middle line:84%
when he asked the alien woman
where they came from, she said,

00:36:49.107 --> 00:36:50.308 align:middle line:90%
"What difference does it make?

00:36:50.308 --> 00:36:51.576 align:middle line:84%
Because you wouldn't
know where it was

00:36:51.576 --> 00:36:53.978 align:middle line:84%
because we call it
different than you do."

00:36:53.978 --> 00:36:58.549 align:middle line:84%
And I think that we need to
remember a couple of things.

00:36:58.549 --> 00:37:01.052 align:middle line:84%
Number one, that this is
not an American phenomenon.

00:37:01.052 --> 00:37:03.288 align:middle line:84%
So all those contactees in the
50s weren't just in America.

00:37:03.288 --> 00:37:07.692 align:middle line:84%
If you want to go to Latin
America and start doing research

00:37:07.692 --> 00:37:09.427 align:middle line:84%
on UFOs and contact,
most of the --

00:37:09.427 --> 00:37:10.528 align:middle line:90%
>> Regina: Oh yes.

00:37:10.528 --> 00:37:13.298 align:middle line:84%
>> Paola: -- Six
topas.

00:37:13.298 --> 00:37:14.299 align:middle line:90%
The --

00:37:14.299 --> 00:37:15.533 align:middle line:90%
>> Regina: Brazil, Mexico, yeah.

00:37:15.533 --> 00:37:16.768 align:middle line:84%
>> Paola: All the
contacts that happened

00:37:16.768 --> 00:37:18.336 align:middle line:84%
in South America were
human-type aliens.

00:37:18.336 --> 00:37:21.005 align:middle line:90%
People that came off the craft.

00:37:21.005 --> 00:37:23.574 align:middle line:84%
Six topas used to bring all the
people with them and they used

00:37:23.574 --> 00:37:25.109 align:middle line:90%
to go out in the desert.

00:37:25.109 --> 00:37:27.278 align:middle line:84%
The craft landed and these
people would come off

00:37:27.278 --> 00:37:28.079 align:middle line:90%
and it was normal.

00:37:28.079 --> 00:37:29.514 align:middle line:90%
In Latin America.

00:37:29.514 --> 00:37:30.248 align:middle line:90%
>> Regina: Yes.

00:37:30.248 --> 00:37:31.749 align:middle line:90%
>> Paola: Okay?

00:37:31.749 --> 00:37:35.687 align:middle line:84%
And Luis Fernando Mostajo who
was in Bolivia, he also --

00:37:35.687 --> 00:37:37.622 align:middle line:84%
he had contact with
these people.

00:37:37.622 --> 00:37:39.824 align:middle line:84%
Why is it -- I'm going to
ask you the question --

00:37:39.824 --> 00:37:41.059 align:middle line:90%
why is it in the United States

00:37:41.059 --> 00:37:43.661 align:middle line:84%
that UFologies characterize
commercially

00:37:43.661 --> 00:37:45.396 align:middle line:84%
with the alien Gray
abduction scenario,

00:37:45.396 --> 00:37:47.965 align:middle line:84%
and nobody goes backwards
to look

00:37:47.965 --> 00:37:50.268 align:middle line:84%
at who really were
giving us the messages.

00:37:50.268 --> 00:37:53.471 align:middle line:84%
And who, in Latin America,
are still doing it.

00:37:53.471 --> 00:37:54.472 align:middle line:84%
>> Regina: Well that's
why I wanted

00:37:54.472 --> 00:37:56.841 align:middle line:90%
to do this interview with you.

00:37:56.841 --> 00:38:02.113 align:middle line:84%
Because we've all -- our brains
have been co-opted with imagery

00:38:02.113 --> 00:38:06.951 align:middle line:84%
with Grays, of you know,
preying mantis types

00:38:06.951 --> 00:38:08.553 align:middle line:84%
of beings [chuckles]
and so forth.

00:38:08.553 --> 00:38:12.623 align:middle line:84%
We're only seeing these exotic,
very foreign looking entities.

00:38:12.623 --> 00:38:14.425 align:middle line:84%
And that's what's
being propagated by,

00:38:14.425 --> 00:38:17.996 align:middle line:84%
not just Hollywood, but also
really the industry itself

00:38:17.996 --> 00:38:19.030 align:middle line:90%
of UFology.

00:38:19.030 --> 00:38:20.064 align:middle line:84%
A lot of that has
been put forward --

00:38:20.064 --> 00:38:21.399 align:middle line:90%
>> Paola: Well you're --

00:38:21.399 --> 00:38:22.834 align:middle line:84%
>> Regina: And television
shows that are ongoing, so --

00:38:22.834 --> 00:38:23.968 align:middle line:84%
>> Paola: Yeah you used
the word "industry"

00:38:23.968 --> 00:38:25.470 align:middle line:90%
which is really interesting

00:38:25.470 --> 00:38:28.573 align:middle line:84%
because Steven Greer uses the
word "commercial UFology".

00:38:28.573 --> 00:38:29.807 align:middle line:90%
>> Regina: Yes.

00:38:29.807 --> 00:38:33.044 align:middle line:84%
>> Paola: And you
know, I have so many --

00:38:33.044 --> 00:38:37.115 align:middle line:84%
so much respect for the
researchers that are, you know,

00:38:37.115 --> 00:38:39.784 align:middle line:84%
part of the whole
entire UFO movement.

00:38:39.784 --> 00:38:44.088 align:middle line:84%
But being a teacher and having
an educational background,

00:38:44.088 --> 00:38:46.791 align:middle line:84%
my thoughts are how
did this all start?

00:38:46.791 --> 00:38:49.927 align:middle line:90%
Who are we really talking about?

00:38:49.927 --> 00:38:52.230 align:middle line:90%
Let's look at other countries.

00:38:52.230 --> 00:38:55.133 align:middle line:84%
Let's look at the thing from
the -- well ancient aliens.

00:38:55.133 --> 00:39:00.872 align:middle line:84%
Look how ancient aliens has
become an educational method

00:39:00.872 --> 00:39:03.574 align:middle line:84%
to prove UFology
going backwards.

00:39:03.574 --> 00:39:08.679 align:middle line:84%
So the whole Val Thor scenario
I call "Back to the future".

00:39:08.679 --> 00:39:10.882 align:middle line:84%
>> Regina: Now how long was
Val Thor at the Pentagon?

00:39:10.882 --> 00:39:14.786 align:middle line:84%
>> Paola: From what I understand
talking to the Director,

00:39:14.786 --> 00:39:16.854 align:middle line:84%
Craig Campobasa,
who's doing the movie,

00:39:16.854 --> 00:39:17.922 align:middle line:90%
"Stranger at the Pentagon" --

00:39:17.922 --> 00:39:18.923 align:middle line:90%
>> Regina: It's so cool.

00:39:18.923 --> 00:39:19.657 align:middle line:90%
>> Paola: He never went home.

00:39:19.657 --> 00:39:21.392 align:middle line:90%
>> Regina: Okay.

00:39:21.392 --> 00:39:22.560 align:middle line:90%
>> Paola: He's still around.

00:39:22.560 --> 00:39:23.728 align:middle line:84%
I mean why -- from
what I understand

00:39:23.728 --> 00:39:26.731 align:middle line:84%
because Craig Campobasa
was telling me

00:39:26.731 --> 00:39:31.235 align:middle line:84%
that he has the documents
from Frank Stranges' wife --

00:39:31.235 --> 00:39:33.771 align:middle line:84%
I think it's his third wife
-- he has all those documents

00:39:33.771 --> 00:39:35.706 align:middle line:90%
and there's no proof that he --

00:39:35.706 --> 00:39:36.574 align:middle line:90%
>> Regina: That he ever left.

00:39:36.574 --> 00:39:37.975 align:middle line:90%
>> Paola: He ever left.

00:39:37.975 --> 00:39:40.545 align:middle line:84%
That basically if they
have a craft that's near --

00:39:40.545 --> 00:39:42.914 align:middle line:84%
and everybody wants to
go now to Lake Meade

00:39:42.914 --> 00:39:43.714 align:middle line:90%
and see if they can see it.

00:39:43.714 --> 00:39:44.315 align:middle line:90%
>> Regina: Right.

00:39:44.315 --> 00:39:45.683 align:middle line:90%
Right.

00:39:45.683 --> 00:39:46.818 align:middle line:84%
>> Paola: And they want
to go -- but Las Vegas --

00:39:46.818 --> 00:39:48.186 align:middle line:84%
well, you know, when
I think about --

00:39:48.186 --> 00:39:51.355 align:middle line:84%
I've done so many
stories around Las Vegas.

00:39:51.355 --> 00:39:56.027 align:middle line:84%
When I think about that
place, if the beings think

00:39:56.027 --> 00:39:59.030 align:middle line:84%
that that's planet Earth
[chuckles], they are going

00:39:59.030 --> 00:40:00.531 align:middle line:90%
to think that we are crazy.

00:40:00.531 --> 00:40:01.632 align:middle line:84%
>> Regina: Take a few snaps
and go back to their planet

00:40:01.632 --> 00:40:03.267 align:middle line:90%
and say, whoa [chuckles]!

00:40:03.267 --> 00:40:04.769 align:middle line:90%
>> Paola: I know.

00:40:04.769 --> 00:40:06.337 align:middle line:84%
But -- I know because Las
Vegas is very close to Nellis.

00:40:06.337 --> 00:40:07.538 align:middle line:90%
>> Regina: Yes.

00:40:07.538 --> 00:40:08.673 align:middle line:84%
>> Paola: It's very
close to Area 51.

00:40:08.673 --> 00:40:09.640 align:middle line:90%
>> Regina: Yes it is.

00:40:09.640 --> 00:40:11.108 align:middle line:90%
>> Paola: The Cherisol case,

00:40:11.108 --> 00:40:13.044 align:middle line:84%
which I did with the Tall
White Aliens, is right there

00:40:13.044 --> 00:40:15.146 align:middle line:84%
in Indian Springs,
right out of Vegas.

00:40:15.146 --> 00:40:16.247 align:middle line:90%
>> Regina: Yes.

00:40:16.247 --> 00:40:18.316 align:middle line:84%
>> Paola: And the --
he was 65, so they came

00:40:18.316 --> 00:40:19.617 align:middle line:90%
into Vegas these beings.

00:40:19.617 --> 00:40:21.719 align:middle line:84%
I'm thinking, good
grief [chuckles]!

00:40:21.719 --> 00:40:22.787 align:middle line:90%
>> Regina: Yeah.

00:40:22.787 --> 00:40:23.621 align:middle line:90%
>> Paola: You know [chuckles].

00:40:23.621 --> 00:40:25.089 align:middle line:90%
>> Regina: Ka-ching.

00:40:25.089 --> 00:40:27.358 align:middle line:84%
Okay, so let's talk about
Dr. John Mack for a moment.

00:40:27.358 --> 00:40:33.698 align:middle line:84%
Okay? Because now what we're
establishing here is we

00:40:33.698 --> 00:40:34.966 align:middle line:90%
love him.

00:40:34.966 --> 00:40:36.868 align:middle line:84%
It just makes my
heart, you know,

00:40:36.868 --> 00:40:38.236 align:middle line:90%
hurt to think he's not here.

00:40:38.236 --> 00:40:40.171 align:middle line:84%
Everybody who ever
met the man --

00:40:40.171 --> 00:40:41.005 align:middle line:90%
>> Paola: Loves him.

00:40:41.005 --> 00:40:41.906 align:middle line:90%
>> Regina: -- loves John Mack.

00:40:41.906 --> 00:40:43.007 align:middle line:90%
Universally loved.

00:40:43.007 --> 00:40:44.442 align:middle line:84%
And he was a very,
very brave soul.

00:40:44.442 --> 00:40:49.947 align:middle line:84%
He chose to take on this
subject of alien abduction while

00:40:49.947 --> 00:40:52.650 align:middle line:84%
at the head of clinical
psychology

00:40:52.650 --> 00:40:55.386 align:middle line:90%
at Harvard University.

00:40:55.386 --> 00:40:59.524 align:middle line:84%
He suffered as a result
of choosing to do this.

00:40:59.524 --> 00:41:04.128 align:middle line:84%
And he did it because at the
request of another person

00:41:04.128 --> 00:41:06.397 align:middle line:84%
who was a researcher
in this field, right?

00:41:06.397 --> 00:41:09.333 align:middle line:84%
And he started looking
into the cases of some

00:41:09.333 --> 00:41:11.903 align:middle line:84%
of these people claiming
to have been abducted.

00:41:11.903 --> 00:41:13.404 align:middle line:84%
Now you pick the
story up from there

00:41:13.404 --> 00:41:15.673 align:middle line:84%
because his research
is very well-respected.

00:41:15.673 --> 00:41:18.075 align:middle line:84%
>> Paola: Well I
met John Mack --

00:41:18.075 --> 00:41:20.177 align:middle line:84%
actually he came to
Italy to a conference

00:41:20.177 --> 00:41:22.113 align:middle line:90%
in Florence just before he died.

00:41:22.113 --> 00:41:24.615 align:middle line:84%
And I spent three or
four days with him.

00:41:24.615 --> 00:41:29.020 align:middle line:84%
And he explained to me that he
had learned so much from this

00:41:29.020 --> 00:41:30.521 align:middle line:84%
because some of his patients
were coming in, you know,

00:41:30.521 --> 00:41:35.293 align:middle line:84%
and he said, "You need to
listen to witness testimony."

00:41:35.293 --> 00:41:36.928 align:middle line:84%
He says, "They were
telling the truth."

00:41:36.928 --> 00:41:40.865 align:middle line:84%
So he -- first books were
on abduction, and that means

00:41:40.865 --> 00:41:42.400 align:middle line:84%
that we're dealing
also with the,

00:41:42.400 --> 00:41:44.569 align:middle line:90%
you know, the Gray scenario.

00:41:44.569 --> 00:41:49.206 align:middle line:84%
And he said to me, well, he
said, "You know lately --

00:41:49.206 --> 00:41:50.775 align:middle line:84%
" and this was just
before he died.

00:41:50.775 --> 00:41:52.910 align:middle line:90%
This was around 2005.

00:41:52.910 --> 00:41:54.478 align:middle line:84%
He says, "Lately what I've
been getting for people

00:41:54.478 --> 00:41:59.483 align:middle line:84%
that have come in to my practice
-- " And he's a psychiatrist.

00:41:59.483 --> 00:42:00.284 align:middle line:90%
He's not just a psychologist.

00:42:00.284 --> 00:42:01.986 align:middle line:90%
>> Regina: Right.

00:42:01.986 --> 00:42:03.354 align:middle line:84%
>> Paola: He said, "People who
tell me they've been contacted

00:42:03.354 --> 00:42:05.389 align:middle line:90%
and directly downloaded."

00:42:05.389 --> 00:42:06.424 align:middle line:90%
Which means that they --

00:42:06.424 --> 00:42:08.759 align:middle line:84%
in their dreams and
in their thoughts,

00:42:08.759 --> 00:42:09.994 align:middle line:90%
they are being contacted by --

00:42:09.994 --> 00:42:13.998 align:middle line:84%
and maybe it's certainly
not the same group

00:42:13.998 --> 00:42:17.101 align:middle line:90%
that did the physical abductions

00:42:17.101 --> 00:42:19.337 align:middle line:84%
or the DNA testing
that was done.

00:42:19.337 --> 00:42:22.807 align:middle line:84%
He said -- so he said, "Paola,
the big problem that we have

00:42:22.807 --> 00:42:25.710 align:middle line:84%
in accepting all of this -- "
and he stepped up to the plate.

00:42:25.710 --> 00:42:28.346 align:middle line:84%
Colonel Corso stepped
up to the plate --

00:42:28.346 --> 00:42:29.580 align:middle line:90%
>> Regina: Yes.

00:42:29.580 --> 00:42:31.048 align:middle line:84%
>> Paola: -- so did Paul
Hellyer; some of the greats.

00:42:31.048 --> 00:42:32.550 align:middle line:84%
He said, "The problem
I'm having," he says,

00:42:32.550 --> 00:42:38.222 align:middle line:84%
"Is talking to people that
we must change our world view

00:42:38.222 --> 00:42:41.092 align:middle line:84%
in order to accommodate
this reality."

00:42:41.092 --> 00:42:44.261 align:middle line:84%
It's not that we put
this reality in the box

00:42:44.261 --> 00:42:46.731 align:middle line:84%
that we already have, we
have to change the box.

00:42:46.731 --> 00:42:49.200 align:middle line:84%
We have to change
the world view.

00:42:49.200 --> 00:42:54.405 align:middle line:84%
It forces you to shatter your
paradigm that you live in.

00:42:54.405 --> 00:42:55.239 align:middle line:90%
>> Regina: It does.

00:42:55.239 --> 00:42:56.741 align:middle line:90%
>> Paola: It's earth shattering.

00:42:56.741 --> 00:42:59.777 align:middle line:84%
So that's -- and personally,
if people don't want to talk

00:42:59.777 --> 00:43:02.213 align:middle line:84%
about it, I'm not
going to talk about it

00:43:02.213 --> 00:43:04.615 align:middle line:84%
because they're not ready
to shatter their paradigm,

00:43:04.615 --> 00:43:06.684 align:middle line:84%
because you have to have
something to put in place

00:43:06.684 --> 00:43:10.154 align:middle line:84%
after your paradigm
gets shattered.

00:43:10.154 --> 00:43:13.557 align:middle line:84%
But I really want to encourage
people on a philosophical level

00:43:13.557 --> 00:43:20.464 align:middle line:84%
to look at what this phenomenon
does to our world view.

00:43:20.464 --> 00:43:24.802 align:middle line:84%
And if maybe it's time for us
to join the cosmic cultures.

00:43:24.802 --> 00:43:26.103 align:middle line:90%
>> Regina: You think?

00:43:26.103 --> 00:43:28.139 align:middle line:84%
I mean it's -- I mean
I suppose because both

00:43:28.139 --> 00:43:30.474 align:middle line:84%
of us have been interested
in this for so many years.

00:43:30.474 --> 00:43:31.409 align:middle line:90%
For decades now.

00:43:31.409 --> 00:43:32.943 align:middle line:90%
It seems so overdue.

00:43:32.943 --> 00:43:34.712 align:middle line:84%
But there are always
what you'd call

00:43:34.712 --> 00:43:37.214 align:middle line:84%
in marketing terms,
"Early adopters".

00:43:37.214 --> 00:43:39.817 align:middle line:84%
And so in these fields we happen
to be among early adopters

00:43:39.817 --> 00:43:42.486 align:middle line:90%
as are many of our viewers.

00:43:42.486 --> 00:43:44.121 align:middle line:84%
Other people are just
now coming to this.

00:43:44.121 --> 00:43:46.691 align:middle line:84%
And you have to really wait
until the masses are ready

00:43:46.691 --> 00:43:50.661 align:middle line:84%
to start accepting a paradigm
shift before you can ever do

00:43:50.661 --> 00:43:51.796 align:middle line:90%
anything with it.

00:43:51.796 --> 00:43:53.330 align:middle line:90%
There's no point.

00:43:53.330 --> 00:43:55.032 align:middle line:84%
It won't take hold until that
time has come where there's

00:43:55.032 --> 00:43:57.134 align:middle line:84%
that deep saturation
and consciousness.

00:43:57.134 --> 00:43:59.704 align:middle line:84%
But what's kind of a
bummer about this is

00:43:59.704 --> 00:44:03.107 align:middle line:84%
that as we're maturing,
finally, coming to the point.

00:44:03.107 --> 00:44:07.211 align:middle line:84%
And I mean certainly Fukushima
pushed us into the need

00:44:07.211 --> 00:44:10.081 align:middle line:84%
for that kind of clear
thinking and maturity.

00:44:10.081 --> 00:44:11.449 align:middle line:90%
At the same time,

00:44:11.449 --> 00:44:15.353 align:middle line:84%
the entertainment industry
is pumping out nothing

00:44:15.353 --> 00:44:17.688 align:middle line:84%
but one fright scenario
after another.

00:44:17.688 --> 00:44:22.293 align:middle line:84%
And then we hear about the
horrid alien abductions that --

00:44:22.293 --> 00:44:25.162 align:middle line:84%
where everything has been
very painful and frightening.

00:44:25.162 --> 00:44:26.263 align:middle line:90%
That has a -- that's a whole --

00:44:26.263 --> 00:44:28.432 align:middle line:84%
that has a subtext
to it as well.

00:44:28.432 --> 00:44:30.334 align:middle line:84%
Because even John
Mack in dealing

00:44:30.334 --> 00:44:34.672 align:middle line:84%
with the abductees said they
all seem to still have this --

00:44:34.672 --> 00:44:38.109 align:middle line:84%
they had often expanded
abilities after that.

00:44:38.109 --> 00:44:39.643 align:middle line:84%
They ended up having a
deep reverence and respect

00:44:39.643 --> 00:44:43.114 align:middle line:84%
for the beings that had
shown them all of this

00:44:43.114 --> 00:44:45.483 align:middle line:84%
and opened these
gateways for them.

00:44:45.483 --> 00:44:46.917 align:middle line:84%
So it's not just the
black and white issue.

00:44:46.917 --> 00:44:48.486 align:middle line:84%
But Hollywood's making
it black and white.

00:44:48.486 --> 00:44:50.187 align:middle line:84%
And we have a new
generation of people coming

00:44:50.187 --> 00:44:52.456 align:middle line:84%
up thinking transhumanism
is going

00:44:52.456 --> 00:44:54.058 align:middle line:84%
to be the big thing
of the future.

00:44:54.058 --> 00:44:56.627 align:middle line:84%
Or we're going to be
taken over by aliens.

00:44:56.627 --> 00:44:59.697 align:middle line:84%
>> Paola: You know, when people
say we're going to be taken

00:44:59.697 --> 00:45:01.932 align:middle line:84%
over by aliens, I don't even
pay attention to them anymore.

00:45:01.932 --> 00:45:02.600 align:middle line:90%
It's so ridiculous.

00:45:02.600 --> 00:45:03.601 align:middle line:90%
I mean --

00:45:03.601 --> 00:45:04.668 align:middle line:90%
>> Regina: I know, but --

00:45:04.668 --> 00:45:05.703 align:middle line:84%
>> Paola: -- they would
have taken over --

00:45:05.703 --> 00:45:07.071 align:middle line:90%
they would have taken us

00:45:07.071 --> 00:45:08.939 align:middle line:84%
over when we exploded the
atomic bomb, I mean --

00:45:08.939 --> 00:45:10.341 align:middle line:84%
>> Regina: [Chuckles]
the first one.

00:45:10.341 --> 00:45:11.842 align:middle line:84%
>> Paola: You know, I'm very
interested in the vision

00:45:11.842 --> 00:45:14.678 align:middle line:84%
that Roddenberry
had of Star Trek.

00:45:14.678 --> 00:45:19.083 align:middle line:84%
Because I think that, you know,
for all that Hollywood did,

00:45:19.083 --> 00:45:22.319 align:middle line:84%
the Roddenberry scenario
is played out world wide.

00:45:22.319 --> 00:45:23.821 align:middle line:84%
There are more Trekkies out
there than [chuckles] --

00:45:23.821 --> 00:45:24.488 align:middle line:90%
>> Regina: Yes.

00:45:24.488 --> 00:45:25.556 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

00:45:25.556 --> 00:45:26.891 align:middle line:84%
>> Paola: -- I've
ever seen in my life.

00:45:26.891 --> 00:45:29.160 align:middle line:84%
You even see the
fanatical point of view.

00:45:29.160 --> 00:45:33.831 align:middle line:84%
But that means that it
struck a chord of truth.

00:45:33.831 --> 00:45:36.100 align:middle line:90%
The whole Star Trek.

00:45:36.100 --> 00:45:36.967 align:middle line:84%
Which means that we're
part of a federation.

00:45:36.967 --> 00:45:40.204 align:middle line:90%
Let's get a clue here.

00:45:40.204 --> 00:45:44.408 align:middle line:84%
And unless we have some kind
of dialog that is compassionate

00:45:44.408 --> 00:45:46.877 align:middle line:84%
and respectful, we're
not going to be able

00:45:46.877 --> 00:45:49.079 align:middle line:90%
to dialog among the stars.

00:45:49.079 --> 00:45:50.714 align:middle line:90%
I mean dialog to the people.

00:45:50.714 --> 00:45:52.783 align:middle line:84%
I mean they don't even want
to have contact -- who --

00:45:52.783 --> 00:45:54.218 align:middle line:84%
why would you want
to have contact

00:45:54.218 --> 00:45:55.953 align:middle line:84%
with some other people
[chuckles] that are, you know --

00:45:55.953 --> 00:45:57.154 align:middle line:90%
>> Regina: Right.

00:45:57.154 --> 00:45:58.088 align:middle line:84%
>> Paola: -- walking
around right now.

00:45:58.088 --> 00:45:59.957 align:middle line:90%
So Hollywood is a mixture.

00:45:59.957 --> 00:46:05.763 align:middle line:84%
I don't see Hollywood as being
all bad, because I see films

00:46:05.763 --> 00:46:08.899 align:middle line:84%
that Spielberg made initially
opening the door for me.

00:46:08.899 --> 00:46:10.901 align:middle line:84%
"Close Encounters"
opened the door.

00:46:10.901 --> 00:46:12.469 align:middle line:90%
>> Regina: Oh yeah.

00:46:12.469 --> 00:46:13.737 align:middle line:90%
And also "ET".

00:46:13.737 --> 00:46:14.872 align:middle line:84%
>> Paola: "ET" -- and then
before he died, you know,

00:46:14.872 --> 00:46:16.006 align:middle line:90%
Carl Sagan wrote "Contact".

00:46:16.006 --> 00:46:17.208 align:middle line:90%
>> Regina: Yes.

00:46:17.208 --> 00:46:17.942 align:middle line:84%
And there were some
beautiful things.

00:46:17.942 --> 00:46:19.210 align:middle line:90%
>> Paola: Yes.

00:46:19.210 --> 00:46:20.077 align:middle line:84%
>> Regina: Beautiful
movies and especially

00:46:20.077 --> 00:46:21.412 align:middle line:90%
through -- from the 80s.

00:46:21.412 --> 00:46:23.781 align:middle line:84%
And even some lovely
things in through the 90s.

00:46:23.781 --> 00:46:25.015 align:middle line:90%
And films like "Powder".

00:46:25.015 --> 00:46:27.818 align:middle line:84%
One of my favorite
films ever, "Powder".

00:46:27.818 --> 00:46:29.386 align:middle line:90%
But that's not kind of --

00:46:29.386 --> 00:46:30.988 align:middle line:84%
what's going on right
now is what I'm saying.

00:46:30.988 --> 00:46:35.092 align:middle line:84%
Right now it seems to be a much
harsher, more powerless kind

00:46:35.092 --> 00:46:37.394 align:middle line:84%
of scenario that's
being put out there.

00:46:37.394 --> 00:46:40.598 align:middle line:84%
>> Paola: Well you know,
this is the problem even

00:46:40.598 --> 00:46:41.999 align:middle line:90%
with talking about UFOs.

00:46:41.999 --> 00:46:44.835 align:middle line:84%
The first thing I say when I go
on stage is, I'm not Disneyland

00:46:44.835 --> 00:46:45.936 align:middle line:90%
and I'm not entertainment.

00:46:45.936 --> 00:46:47.104 align:middle line:90%
>> Regina: Right.

00:46:47.104 --> 00:46:47.905 align:middle line:84%
>> Paola: I'm not
here to entertain.

00:46:47.905 --> 00:46:49.340 align:middle line:90%
>> Regina: Right.

00:46:49.340 --> 00:46:51.041 align:middle line:84%
>> Paola: So maybe what
people want is entertainment.

00:46:51.041 --> 00:46:51.909 align:middle line:90%
And that's what they're getting.

00:46:51.909 --> 00:46:52.877 align:middle line:90%
>> Regina: That's true.

00:46:52.877 --> 00:46:54.311 align:middle line:90%
There you -- that's true --

00:46:54.311 --> 00:46:55.312 align:middle line:84%
>> Paola: They're getting
entertainment [chuckles].

00:46:55.312 --> 00:46:56.714 align:middle line:90%
You know, I mean because like --

00:46:56.714 --> 00:46:57.581 align:middle line:84%
>> Regina: Because the
other requires a good amount

00:46:57.581 --> 00:46:58.782 align:middle line:90%
of research.

00:46:58.782 --> 00:46:59.683 align:middle line:84%
It takes personal
responsibility and maturity --

00:46:59.683 --> 00:47:01.018 align:middle line:90%
>> Paola: Right.

00:47:01.018 --> 00:47:02.186 align:middle line:84%
>> Regina: -- to take this
subject on and its implications.

00:47:02.186 --> 00:47:03.454 align:middle line:90%
Now let's talk about disclosure.

00:47:03.454 --> 00:47:08.025 align:middle line:84%
We have Steven Greer's
discloser from 2001.

00:47:08.025 --> 00:47:12.329 align:middle line:84%
And all the way up through the
more recent disclosure projects.

00:47:12.329 --> 00:47:13.697 align:middle line:90%
Where have you been present?

00:47:13.697 --> 00:47:16.300 align:middle line:84%
What do you think the hope
is coming out of them?

00:47:16.300 --> 00:47:18.135 align:middle line:84%
And what do you see the
disappointments being --

00:47:18.135 --> 00:47:20.070 align:middle line:90%
coming out of them as well?

00:47:20.070 --> 00:47:22.039 align:middle line:84%
>> Paola: Well, the first thing
about any kind of movement

00:47:22.039 --> 00:47:23.974 align:middle line:90%
or any kind of research is,

00:47:23.974 --> 00:47:26.176 align:middle line:84%
you know there's no
money around this.

00:47:26.176 --> 00:47:28.879 align:middle line:84%
And the problem is that
I really admire somebody

00:47:28.879 --> 00:47:31.081 align:middle line:84%
like Steven Greer that
crowd-funded the movie "Sirius".

00:47:31.081 --> 00:47:33.350 align:middle line:90%
And that was the people's movie.

00:47:33.350 --> 00:47:35.719 align:middle line:84%
So it's not in movie theaters
because the people paid for it.

00:47:35.719 --> 00:47:36.420 align:middle line:90%
And they can have it.

00:47:36.420 --> 00:47:37.688 align:middle line:90%
And they can screen it.

00:47:37.688 --> 00:47:40.057 align:middle line:84%
And I was a consultant
on that film.

00:47:40.057 --> 00:47:42.660 align:middle line:84%
So two years ago I
was out at Crestone,

00:47:42.660 --> 00:47:46.430 align:middle line:84%
Colorado with Amardeep
Keleka, the director.

00:47:46.430 --> 00:47:50.501 align:middle line:84%
And he was so shocked by some
of the things he suffered.

00:47:50.501 --> 00:47:51.936 align:middle line:84%
They forgot to turn
on the cameras.

00:47:51.936 --> 00:47:56.206 align:middle line:84%
I mean there is so much
activity in the San Luis valley.

00:47:56.206 --> 00:47:59.877 align:middle line:84%
And when we were out
there with Steven Greer,

00:47:59.877 --> 00:48:01.245 align:middle line:84%
that you don't need any
other proof [chuckles].

00:48:01.245 --> 00:48:03.213 align:middle line:84%
>> Regina: Okay so
tell me about that.

00:48:03.213 --> 00:48:04.815 align:middle line:84%
What kind of activity
was happening --

00:48:04.815 --> 00:48:05.816 align:middle line:90%
>> Paola: Well, you know --

00:48:05.816 --> 00:48:07.251 align:middle line:90%
>> Regina: -- in the background.

00:48:07.251 --> 00:48:08.552 align:middle line:84%
>> Paola: First of all,
let's say that the difference

00:48:08.552 --> 00:48:11.722 align:middle line:84%
between Steven and any
other CE5 protocols is

00:48:11.722 --> 00:48:14.391 align:middle line:84%
that he does Apoosha Ceremony
in Sanskrit.

00:48:14.391 --> 00:48:17.661 align:middle line:84%
So there's a heavy
amount of meditation --

00:48:17.661 --> 00:48:18.729 align:middle line:90%
>> Regina: Yes there is.

00:48:18.729 --> 00:48:20.097 align:middle line:90%
>> Paola: And silence.

00:48:20.097 --> 00:48:22.499 align:middle line:84%
I've been other places where
people are yelling, screaming,

00:48:22.499 --> 00:48:23.968 align:middle line:84%
and acting crazy
when they see a UFO.

00:48:23.968 --> 00:48:27.338 align:middle line:84%
And I'm wondering what
they're thinking up there.

00:48:27.338 --> 00:48:29.306 align:middle line:90%
But Steven requires silence.

00:48:29.306 --> 00:48:33.477 align:middle line:84%
And he requires a mental
connection with whatever's there

00:48:33.477 --> 00:48:36.347 align:middle line:84%
to invite them respectfully
into the space.

00:48:36.347 --> 00:48:38.782 align:middle line:84%
So he's doing --
his CE5 protocols --

00:48:38.782 --> 00:48:40.451 align:middle line:84%
I talk about it in all my
books because they are --

00:48:40.451 --> 00:48:42.886 align:middle line:84%
in fact, we should be using
them at the United Nations.

00:48:42.886 --> 00:48:48.759 align:middle line:84%
We should be using them on Earth
not just for cosmic cultures.

00:48:48.759 --> 00:48:53.664 align:middle line:84%
But we saw a craft the second
day that was over our heads.

00:48:53.664 --> 00:48:54.732 align:middle line:90%
It was flashing.

00:48:54.732 --> 00:48:57.601 align:middle line:84%
And everybody was --
they were in shock,

00:48:57.601 --> 00:49:00.871 align:middle line:84%
but then there were two
F16s, one from one side

00:49:00.871 --> 00:49:01.839 align:middle line:90%
and one from the other --

00:49:01.839 --> 00:49:03.073 align:middle line:90%
>> Regina: [Chuckles] yeah.

00:49:03.073 --> 00:49:04.575 align:middle line:84%
>> Paola: -- that came
towards the craft.

00:49:04.575 --> 00:49:07.044 align:middle line:84%
And the craft right away you
saw it -- it's in the film.

00:49:07.044 --> 00:49:09.847 align:middle line:84%
Goes right into the clouds, and
everybody broke out in tears.

00:49:09.847 --> 00:49:13.150 align:middle line:84%
Now I am positive that those
pilots did not know what the

00:49:13.150 --> 00:49:14.418 align:middle line:90%
target was.

00:49:14.418 --> 00:49:16.186 align:middle line:84%
They were told to go
to a certain target --

00:49:16.186 --> 00:49:18.188 align:middle line:84%
you're not going to tell
the pilot, hey you know,

00:49:18.188 --> 00:49:20.824 align:middle line:84%
there's a -- go -- because
they're going to go,

00:49:20.824 --> 00:49:21.358 align:middle line:90%
what am I going to do?

00:49:21.358 --> 00:49:21.959 align:middle line:90%
Shoot at it?

00:49:21.959 --> 00:49:22.760 align:middle line:90%
What?

00:49:22.760 --> 00:49:23.961 align:middle line:90%
>> Regina: Right.

00:49:23.961 --> 00:49:25.429 align:middle line:84%
>> Paola: So there's these
two planes coming in .

00:49:25.429 --> 00:49:27.064 align:middle line:84%
There's this craft over
our heads that had been

00:49:27.064 --> 00:49:30.000 align:middle line:84%
over there -- over our heads
for about four minutes.

00:49:30.000 --> 00:49:31.268 align:middle line:90%
And the minute these craft --

00:49:31.268 --> 00:49:34.872 align:middle line:84%
these planes came in
the craft just shot off.

00:49:34.872 --> 00:49:37.508 align:middle line:84%
Now what we were seeing
there was very controlled

00:49:37.508 --> 00:49:39.910 align:middle line:84%
because he has the map
of all the satellites.

00:49:39.910 --> 00:49:43.414 align:middle line:90%
All the flights and everything.

00:49:43.414 --> 00:49:45.482 align:middle line:84%
While we were out
there those six days,

00:49:45.482 --> 00:49:48.185 align:middle line:84%
we saw so much phenomenon
it was incredible.

00:49:48.185 --> 00:49:51.088 align:middle line:84%
But not only in the
skies; on the Earth.

00:49:51.088 --> 00:49:52.656 align:middle line:90%
>> Regina: Okay.

00:49:52.656 --> 00:49:55.059 align:middle line:84%
Now I've been out with them too
each time for 6 days a couple

00:49:55.059 --> 00:49:58.962 align:middle line:84%
of times and that -- that's
what fascinated me the most.

00:49:58.962 --> 00:50:00.998 align:middle line:84%
Because when he takes
you into this quiet,

00:50:00.998 --> 00:50:03.801 align:middle line:84%
meditated space beforehand
to start connecting,

00:50:03.801 --> 00:50:06.804 align:middle line:84%
and also for remote
viewing purposes.

00:50:07.905 --> 00:50:10.774 align:middle line:84%
You're able to tap into
the entire field --

00:50:10.774 --> 00:50:13.811 align:middle line:84%
if you're intuitive you
tap into the entire field.

00:50:13.811 --> 00:50:16.914 align:middle line:84%
And I always found my intuition
was greatly enhanced by the way.

00:50:16.914 --> 00:50:20.317 align:middle line:84%
Going out in the field
with Steven Greer's group,

00:50:20.317 --> 00:50:22.386 align:middle line:84%
I could kind of see
whatever I wanted to.

00:50:22.386 --> 00:50:24.121 align:middle line:84%
And one thing I kept
seeing and --

00:50:24.121 --> 00:50:28.692 align:middle line:84%
was that we're looking for
these signs from fly-bys right?

00:50:28.692 --> 00:50:29.393 align:middle line:90%
>> Paola: Right.

00:50:29.393 --> 00:50:30.594 align:middle line:90%
>> Regina: When in fact,

00:50:30.594 --> 00:50:33.530 align:middle line:84%
just slightly phased
off this density,

00:50:33.530 --> 00:50:35.399 align:middle line:90%
there are UFOs all around.

00:50:35.399 --> 00:50:36.700 align:middle line:90%
>> Paola: Yeah.

00:50:36.700 --> 00:50:37.835 align:middle line:84%
>> Regina: They're out
in the field behind --

00:50:37.835 --> 00:50:38.735 align:middle line:84%
in each of these
weeks I went out --

00:50:38.735 --> 00:50:39.670 align:middle line:90%
>> Paola: Yeah.

00:50:39.670 --> 00:50:40.971 align:middle line:84%
>> Regina: -- they
were around us.

00:50:40.971 --> 00:50:42.439 align:middle line:84%
They were nearby showing
themselves in the crags

00:50:42.439 --> 00:50:46.243 align:middle line:84%
when we were outside
of 29 Palms.

00:50:46.243 --> 00:50:47.611 align:middle line:90%
They're all over the place.

00:50:47.611 --> 00:50:51.415 align:middle line:84%
We just can't see them
with our daytime eyes.

00:50:51.415 --> 00:50:52.716 align:middle line:90%
We can't see them.

00:50:52.716 --> 00:50:54.885 align:middle line:84%
The cameras can't
even pick them up.

00:50:54.885 --> 00:50:56.053 align:middle line:90%
They're all over.

00:50:56.053 --> 00:50:57.421 align:middle line:90%
This is not anything new.

00:50:57.421 --> 00:50:58.789 align:middle line:90%
It's not anything frightening.

00:50:58.789 --> 00:51:01.391 align:middle line:84%
This whole thing about,
you know, they're going --

00:51:01.391 --> 00:51:04.328 align:middle line:84%
as you said jokingly,
that they're going to come

00:51:04.328 --> 00:51:05.796 align:middle line:90%
and take over humanity.

00:51:05.796 --> 00:51:11.068 align:middle line:84%
No they're gently, quietly
sitting all over the place.

00:51:11.068 --> 00:51:12.336 align:middle line:90%
>> Paola: Yeah.

00:51:12.336 --> 00:51:14.605 align:middle line:84%
And you know, you're
exceptionally sensitive.

00:51:14.605 --> 00:51:17.708 align:middle line:84%
So you have that
benefit of seeing.

00:51:17.708 --> 00:51:21.678 align:middle line:84%
I saw only because we used
about well, 20 cameras.

00:51:21.678 --> 00:51:23.313 align:middle line:84%
And we saw the photos
the next day.

00:51:23.313 --> 00:51:24.815 align:middle line:90%
>> Regina: Oh yeah.

00:51:24.815 --> 00:51:25.682 align:middle line:84%
Some of them do -- some of
them I've seen would later show

00:51:25.682 --> 00:51:26.884 align:middle line:90%
up on film.

00:51:26.884 --> 00:51:27.451 align:middle line:90%
>> Paola: On the film.

00:51:27.451 --> 00:51:28.385 align:middle line:90%
>> Regina: Yeah.

00:51:28.385 --> 00:51:29.753 align:middle line:90%
>> Paola: Yeah the beings.

00:51:29.753 --> 00:51:30.888 align:middle line:84%
And I have to say, in the
Wendell Stevens archive,

00:51:30.888 --> 00:51:32.389 align:middle line:84%
there is a picture
of Howard Menger

00:51:32.389 --> 00:51:34.191 align:middle line:90%
and Connie that's all light.

00:51:34.191 --> 00:51:35.792 align:middle line:90%
You see their head, their arms.

00:51:35.792 --> 00:51:37.394 align:middle line:84%
But you don't see the
being, they're all light.

00:51:37.394 --> 00:51:38.862 align:middle line:84%
>> Regina: You don't
see the being, yeah.

00:51:38.862 --> 00:51:40.197 align:middle line:90%
>> Paola: No.

00:51:40.197 --> 00:51:41.865 align:middle line:84%
And I was shocked because
they had their picture taken.

00:51:41.865 --> 00:51:44.334 align:middle line:84%
I'm sure they were putting
their arms around a real person.

00:51:44.334 --> 00:51:45.802 align:middle line:90%
>> Regina: [Chuckles] right.

00:51:45.802 --> 00:51:47.304 align:middle line:84%
>> Paola: But on the film
all you see is the two arms,

00:51:47.304 --> 00:51:48.539 align:middle line:90%
the two legs, the head and --

00:51:48.539 --> 00:51:49.273 align:middle line:84%
>> Regina: It's just
a different density.

00:51:49.273 --> 00:51:50.741 align:middle line:90%
>> Paola: Yeah.

00:51:50.741 --> 00:51:51.875 align:middle line:84%
>> Regina: And of course the
film then didn't have the

00:51:51.875 --> 00:51:53.610 align:middle line:84%
capabilities of digital
film today.

00:51:53.610 --> 00:51:55.479 align:middle line:84%
And then of course we have the
night cams and everything else

00:51:55.479 --> 00:51:57.814 align:middle line:84%
where you can see a
tremendous amount of activity

00:51:57.814 --> 00:51:59.449 align:middle line:84%
with the night cams,
but you can also see it

00:51:59.449 --> 00:52:01.618 align:middle line:90%
with your inside eyes.

00:52:01.618 --> 00:52:03.687 align:middle line:84%
There's that other
photograph you have

00:52:03.687 --> 00:52:08.792 align:middle line:84%
out of Wendell Steven's archive
of that lit up, powered up UFO.

00:52:08.792 --> 00:52:11.528 align:middle line:90%
What is that picture about?

00:52:11.528 --> 00:52:13.664 align:middle line:90%
>> Paola: Well the -- he --

00:52:13.664 --> 00:52:15.265 align:middle line:84%
August Roberts had
a series of photos,

00:52:15.265 --> 00:52:19.870 align:middle line:84%
and they were mostly
from Howard Menger.

00:52:19.870 --> 00:52:23.640 align:middle line:84%
Because the Menger archive
is incredible the amount --

00:52:23.640 --> 00:52:26.710 align:middle line:84%
but then remember --
well what's that about?

00:52:26.710 --> 00:52:28.212 align:middle line:90%
The UFO propulsion system.

00:52:28.212 --> 00:52:32.950 align:middle line:84%
I mean I've been trying to
figure out for the longest time,

00:52:32.950 --> 00:52:36.186 align:middle line:84%
why in outer space we're
seeing these things

00:52:36.186 --> 00:52:37.221 align:middle line:90%
that look like amoeba.

00:52:37.221 --> 00:52:38.622 align:middle line:90%
The power up that are all light.

00:52:38.622 --> 00:52:40.090 align:middle line:84%
These light balls
-- balls of light.

00:52:40.090 --> 00:52:41.491 align:middle line:84%
And that's what the
name of my book is,

00:52:41.491 --> 00:52:44.361 align:middle line:84%
"How Does One Speak
to a Ball of Light?"

00:52:44.361 --> 00:52:48.165 align:middle line:84%
That maybe transform
from light energy.

00:52:48.165 --> 00:52:49.800 align:middle line:90%
Because you've got wave

00:52:49.800 --> 00:52:53.770 align:middle line:84%
and particle situation
there to a solid.

00:52:53.770 --> 00:52:55.372 align:middle line:90%
And they're able to do that.

00:52:55.372 --> 00:52:57.307 align:middle line:84%
And I'm sure we're
able to do that too --

00:52:57.307 --> 00:52:58.575 align:middle line:84%
>> Regina: Well that's
why people say --

00:52:58.575 --> 00:53:00.477 align:middle line:84%
>> Paola: -- but we
just don't find it out.

00:53:00.477 --> 00:53:02.613 align:middle line:84%
>> Regina: No and people -- and
see them blinking in and out.

00:53:02.613 --> 00:53:03.947 align:middle line:90%
You'll see one and then boom!

00:53:03.947 --> 00:53:05.015 align:middle line:90%
Gone.

00:53:05.015 --> 00:53:06.149 align:middle line:84%
>> Paola: Yeah but
I'm sure we can do --

00:53:06.149 --> 00:53:07.251 align:middle line:90%
see anymore I'm positive --

00:53:07.251 --> 00:53:08.485 align:middle line:90%
>> Regina: Well I'm sure we can.

00:53:08.485 --> 00:53:10.220 align:middle line:84%
>> Paola: -- that
this kind of science,

00:53:10.220 --> 00:53:13.223 align:middle line:84%
which we think is
magic, is real.

00:53:13.223 --> 00:53:14.224 align:middle line:90%
And we're just not seeing it.

00:53:14.224 --> 00:53:15.259 align:middle line:90%
>> Regina: It's just physics.

00:53:15.259 --> 00:53:16.793 align:middle line:90%
>> Paola: Yeah.

00:53:16.793 --> 00:53:18.962 align:middle line:84%
We're not seeing it because
it's been put in other projects.

00:53:18.962 --> 00:53:23.533 align:middle line:84%
The -- because for some reason,
you know, the timing is --

00:53:23.533 --> 00:53:25.936 align:middle line:84%
they've got the timing
under wraps.

00:53:25.936 --> 00:53:29.206 align:middle line:84%
Whenever all this is supposed
to come out, we'll be sitting --

00:53:29.206 --> 00:53:32.476 align:middle line:84%
having a glass of wine
saying, well we told you so.

00:53:32.476 --> 00:53:33.777 align:middle line:90%
We knew it.

00:53:33.777 --> 00:53:35.312 align:middle line:84%
But we couldn't prove
it because in 2000 --

00:53:35.312 --> 00:53:37.314 align:middle line:84%
and you know [background
chuckles] --

00:53:37.314 --> 00:53:41.318 align:middle line:84%
in 2013 we were talking about
it, but they didn't decide

00:53:41.318 --> 00:53:42.786 align:middle line:90%
to tell you about it yet.

00:53:42.786 --> 00:53:44.955 align:middle line:84%
>> Regina: Well in Steven
Greer's original disclosure

00:53:44.955 --> 00:53:47.758 align:middle line:84%
at the National Press
Club, right?

00:53:47.758 --> 00:53:49.526 align:middle line:84%
In Washington, DC
that was attended

00:53:49.526 --> 00:53:51.428 align:middle line:90%
by media all over the world.

00:53:51.428 --> 00:53:52.796 align:middle line:90%
I was shocked how many people

00:53:52.796 --> 00:53:55.933 align:middle line:84%
from media sources
were in that room.

00:53:55.933 --> 00:53:58.602 align:middle line:84%
And in fact, at that time
it was said to have had,

00:53:58.602 --> 00:54:01.038 align:middle line:84%
on their webcasts, was
said to have logged

00:54:01.038 --> 00:54:05.509 align:middle line:84%
on the largest audience that the
National Press Club had ever had

00:54:05.509 --> 00:54:07.978 align:middle line:84%
outside of the famous
blue dress.

00:54:07.978 --> 00:54:10.947 align:middle line:84%
Monica Lewinsky's blue dress
[chuckles] announcement.

00:54:10.947 --> 00:54:15.352 align:middle line:84%
And so -- but those
transmissions went

00:54:15.352 --> 00:54:16.653 align:middle line:90%
out very quickly.

00:54:16.653 --> 00:54:18.221 align:middle line:84%
There were people on the
roof and everybody --

00:54:18.221 --> 00:54:20.357 align:middle line:84%
the conference was aware, those
people at home were not going

00:54:20.357 --> 00:54:21.658 align:middle line:84%
to be able to see
this happening.

00:54:21.658 --> 00:54:23.126 align:middle line:84%
>> Paola: Well we
heard it in Italy.

00:54:23.126 --> 00:54:25.796 align:middle line:84%
I -- we were all on a --
because he had come to Italy

00:54:25.796 --> 00:54:26.930 align:middle line:90%
and he had photographed --

00:54:26.930 --> 00:54:27.898 align:middle line:90%
>> Regina: Yes.

00:54:27.898 --> 00:54:28.765 align:middle line:84%
>> Paola: -- all
our military people.

00:54:28.765 --> 00:54:29.766 align:middle line:90%
I helped him with that.

00:54:29.766 --> 00:54:30.734 align:middle line:90%
>> Regina: So you got the audio.

00:54:30.734 --> 00:54:31.468 align:middle line:90%
>> Paola: We got the audio.

00:54:31.468 --> 00:54:32.703 align:middle line:90%
>> Regina: Yeah.

00:54:32.703 --> 00:54:34.171 align:middle line:84%
>> Paola: But that's
all over the world.

00:54:34.171 --> 00:54:35.605 align:middle line:84%
See what shocks me -- and I
don't know as a journalist

00:54:35.605 --> 00:54:39.142 align:middle line:84%
if it shocks you is,
we know this is real.

00:54:39.142 --> 00:54:40.344 align:middle line:90%
>> Regina: Absolutely.

00:54:40.344 --> 00:54:41.812 align:middle line:84%
And everyone in the
room knew it was.

00:54:41.812 --> 00:54:42.612 align:middle line:84%
>> Paola: And what else do
we need to know -- do here?

00:54:42.612 --> 00:54:43.747 align:middle line:90%
>> Regina: I know.

00:54:43.747 --> 00:54:45.015 align:middle line:84%
It gets to the point
where it's like,

00:54:45.015 --> 00:54:46.516 align:middle line:84%
why are we even still
talking about this?

00:54:46.516 --> 00:54:47.317 align:middle line:84%
>> Paola: I mean the
citizen hearing had 40 --

00:54:47.317 --> 00:54:49.553 align:middle line:90%
it had 40 people.

00:54:49.553 --> 00:54:52.489 align:middle line:84%
It had 39 men; one woman,
Linda Moultenhow.

00:54:52.489 --> 00:54:53.991 align:middle line:90%
>> Regina: Yeah.

00:54:53.991 --> 00:54:55.158 align:middle line:84%
>> Paola: And most of the
people were from Latin America.

00:54:55.158 --> 00:54:56.126 align:middle line:84%
And they were Generals
[chuckles] --

00:54:56.126 --> 00:54:57.527 align:middle line:90%
>> Regina: Right.

00:54:57.527 --> 00:54:59.429 align:middle line:84%
>> Paola: They were people in
the military from Latin America.

00:54:59.429 --> 00:55:02.265 align:middle line:84%
Roberta Pinote was there from
Italy.

00:55:02.265 --> 00:55:03.734 align:middle line:90%
There were people from France.

00:55:03.734 --> 00:55:05.102 align:middle line:90%
There were people from England.

00:55:05.102 --> 00:55:07.871 align:middle line:84%
But most of them were
credible witnesses, so --

00:55:07.871 --> 00:55:09.439 align:middle line:84%
>> Regina: Same thing
in disclosure.

00:55:09.439 --> 00:55:12.042 align:middle line:84%
It was mostly military personnel
and then civilian personnel --

00:55:12.042 --> 00:55:13.410 align:middle line:90%
>> Paola: Right.

00:55:13.410 --> 00:55:14.978 align:middle line:84%
>> Regina: -- that were with
the airline industry and so on.

00:55:14.978 --> 00:55:16.480 align:middle line:84%
And the thing is, I remember
this one person stood

00:55:16.480 --> 00:55:20.217 align:middle line:84%
up in the audience who had
come and said, "If this is --

00:55:20.217 --> 00:55:21.618 align:middle line:90%
" after each one gave testimony.

00:55:21.618 --> 00:55:24.654 align:middle line:84%
And I was behind the
scenes with these people.

00:55:24.654 --> 00:55:26.890 align:middle line:90%
And I saw some of them crying.

00:55:26.890 --> 00:55:30.327 align:middle line:84%
Especially the older military
men who were way past the end

00:55:30.327 --> 00:55:32.596 align:middle line:84%
of their career, but they were
still proudly wearing their

00:55:32.596 --> 00:55:34.031 align:middle line:90%
epaulets and so forth,

00:55:34.031 --> 00:55:37.534 align:middle line:84%
crying because they had
publically broken their national

00:55:37.534 --> 00:55:39.136 align:middle line:90%
security vow --

00:55:39.136 --> 00:55:40.103 align:middle line:90%
>> Paola: Right.

00:55:40.103 --> 00:55:41.271 align:middle line:84%
>> Regina: -- which
they had lived

00:55:41.271 --> 00:55:42.105 align:middle line:90%
in fear of their whole lives.

00:55:42.105 --> 00:55:42.939 align:middle line:90%
To be witch hunted.

00:55:42.939 --> 00:55:44.207 align:middle line:90%
Have their pensions taken away;

00:55:44.207 --> 00:55:46.443 align:middle line:84%
their families may be
harmed or something.

00:55:46.443 --> 00:55:47.978 align:middle line:84%
And these were brave
enough people.

00:55:47.978 --> 00:55:50.380 align:middle line:84%
They were shaking and stood
up and gave this information.

00:55:50.380 --> 00:55:52.582 align:middle line:84%
And so this one person
said, well if this is true,

00:55:52.582 --> 00:55:53.750 align:middle line:90%
how come we're not seeing it?

00:55:53.750 --> 00:55:55.452 align:middle line:84%
Why don't -- why
doesn't any of the news

00:55:55.452 --> 00:55:57.020 align:middle line:90%
around the world report on it?

00:55:57.020 --> 00:56:00.323 align:middle line:84%
And a man from the ABC
affiliate in Washington DC

00:56:00.323 --> 00:56:02.592 align:middle line:84%
who was there stood up, and
he said I'll tell you why.

00:56:02.592 --> 00:56:05.362 align:middle line:90%
I'm reporting on it right now.

00:56:05.362 --> 00:56:07.330 align:middle line:84%
My editor is not
going to let this

00:56:07.330 --> 00:56:09.766 align:middle line:84%
on the news tonight
[background chuckles].

00:56:09.766 --> 00:56:11.301 align:middle line:90%
They're not going to let it on.

00:56:11.301 --> 00:56:13.670 align:middle line:84%
And I know from -- as a news
anchor, I tried to report on it.

00:56:13.670 --> 00:56:16.540 align:middle line:84%
That was, I don't know,
almost 30 years ago.

00:56:16.540 --> 00:56:17.741 align:middle line:90%
It wasn't allowed.

00:56:17.741 --> 00:56:19.810 align:middle line:90%
I was not allowed to do that.

00:56:19.810 --> 00:56:21.511 align:middle line:84%
>> Paola: Well, we're
doing the best we can

00:56:21.511 --> 00:56:22.512 align:middle line:84%
under the circumstances
[chuckles].

00:56:22.512 --> 00:56:24.014 align:middle line:90%
What can we do?

00:56:24.014 --> 00:56:25.048 align:middle line:84%
>> Regina: So there -- all
you have are these alternative

00:56:25.048 --> 00:56:25.482 align:middle line:90%
media outlets.

00:56:25.482 --> 00:56:26.216 align:middle line:90%
So --

00:56:26.216 --> 00:56:27.584 align:middle line:90%
>> Paola: Yeah.

00:56:27.584 --> 00:56:28.485 align:middle line:84%
>> Regina: -- anyway, we know
these events have happened.

00:56:28.485 --> 00:56:29.853 align:middle line:90%
>> Paola: Right.

00:56:29.853 --> 00:56:31.121 align:middle line:84%
>> Regina: Amazing events
by brave characters all

00:56:31.121 --> 00:56:32.756 align:middle line:84%
across the board,
including organizers.

00:56:32.756 --> 00:56:34.224 align:middle line:90%
Now let's talk about you.

00:56:34.224 --> 00:56:38.295 align:middle line:84%
Because you want to
put an event together

00:56:38.295 --> 00:56:40.197 align:middle line:90%
in a different kind of way.

00:56:40.197 --> 00:56:41.865 align:middle line:84%
I want to know your
motivation for that.

00:56:41.865 --> 00:56:43.266 align:middle line:90%
What the event's about.

00:56:43.266 --> 00:56:45.869 align:middle line:84%
And why you're doing it
that way and what do you see

00:56:45.869 --> 00:56:47.404 align:middle line:84%
as maybe not being
very effective in some

00:56:47.404 --> 00:56:51.074 align:middle line:84%
of the previous events that
have occurred in conferences.

00:56:51.074 --> 00:56:52.843 align:middle line:84%
>> Paola: Well first
of all let me say

00:56:52.843 --> 00:56:55.745 align:middle line:84%
that I don't want any
commercialized little Gray

00:56:55.745 --> 00:56:58.515 align:middle line:84%
or anything representing
traditional UFology.

00:56:58.515 --> 00:57:00.984 align:middle line:90%
Since I'm an educator, what I'd

00:57:00.984 --> 00:57:04.688 align:middle line:84%
like to have is an intelligent
-- like we're doing here.

00:57:04.688 --> 00:57:05.989 align:middle line:90%
>> Regina: Right.

00:57:05.989 --> 00:57:07.390 align:middle line:84%
>> Paola: An intelligent
dialog about what to do.

00:57:07.390 --> 00:57:09.526 align:middle line:84%
And you and I have
talked about this before.

00:57:09.526 --> 00:57:12.996 align:middle line:84%
And we need -- and we'll talk
about it maybe at the end

00:57:12.996 --> 00:57:16.032 align:middle line:84%
of the program, we need to go
to consciousness studies, okay?

00:57:16.032 --> 00:57:17.367 align:middle line:90%
The rise in consciousness.

00:57:17.367 --> 00:57:19.536 align:middle line:84%
Because this is where
everybody's going.

00:57:19.536 --> 00:57:21.571 align:middle line:90%
>> Regina: Yes.

00:57:21.571 --> 00:57:23.340 align:middle line:84%
>> Paola: This is where all the
great researchers are going.

00:57:23.340 --> 00:57:26.276 align:middle line:84%
This is where the ETs
wanted us to go anyway.

00:57:26.276 --> 00:57:31.314 align:middle line:84%
But I -- in Chicago, Illinois
in 2006 there was a UFO

00:57:31.314 --> 00:57:35.919 align:middle line:84%
over Gate C17 United
Airlines terminal.

00:57:35.919 --> 00:57:37.454 align:middle line:90%
>> Regina: Yes.

00:57:37.454 --> 00:57:38.922 align:middle line:84%
>> Paola: And there were --
it was there for four minutes,

00:57:38.922 --> 00:57:40.657 align:middle line:84%
so everybody that
was there saw it.

00:57:40.657 --> 00:57:42.626 align:middle line:90%
Okay, and CNN had to cover it,

00:57:42.626 --> 00:57:45.629 align:middle line:84%
but who really broke the
story was Hilkovich

00:57:45.629 --> 00:57:47.130 align:middle line:90%
of the "Chicago Tribune".

00:57:47.130 --> 00:57:49.165 align:middle line:84%
There's another journalist,
you know.

00:57:49.165 --> 00:57:51.701 align:middle line:84%
And pilots that came
in saw the craft.

00:57:51.701 --> 00:57:55.005 align:middle line:84%
The craft went up
through the clouds

00:57:55.005 --> 00:57:56.606 align:middle line:84%
and punched a hole
through the crowds.

00:57:56.606 --> 00:57:58.675 align:middle line:84%
I don't believe that
craft was our stuff.

00:57:58.675 --> 00:58:00.544 align:middle line:90%
>> Regina: Right.

00:58:00.544 --> 00:58:01.711 align:middle line:84%
>> Paola: I believe that
craft was making some kind

00:58:01.711 --> 00:58:04.180 align:middle line:90%
of statement over an airport.

00:58:04.180 --> 00:58:07.017 align:middle line:84%
And I -- and since
then the airport

00:58:07.017 --> 00:58:09.719 align:middle line:84%
in China has been closed
three times because of UFOs.

00:58:09.719 --> 00:58:10.954 align:middle line:90%
>> Regina: Yes.

00:58:10.954 --> 00:58:12.389 align:middle line:84%
>> Paola: And when I
was living in Italy,

00:58:12.389 --> 00:58:16.693 align:middle line:84%
Fiumicino had two UFO
sightings that was so obvious

00:58:16.693 --> 00:58:18.795 align:middle line:84%
that they reported
it on the news.

00:58:18.795 --> 00:58:20.163 align:middle line:90%
But nobody cares in Italy.

00:58:20.163 --> 00:58:23.066 align:middle line:84%
I mean you could -- they
reported all UFOs in Italy

00:58:23.066 --> 00:58:23.967 align:middle line:90%
because that's common --

00:58:23.967 --> 00:58:24.901 align:middle line:90%
>> Regina: Right.

00:58:24.901 --> 00:58:26.036 align:middle line:90%
So it's common news there.

00:58:26.036 --> 00:58:26.770 align:middle line:84%
>> Paola: Yeah it's
everyday stuff.

00:58:26.770 --> 00:58:28.204 align:middle line:90%
>> Regina: Yeah.

00:58:28.204 --> 00:58:28.939 align:middle line:84%
So where do you see -- we
only have a couple minutes

00:58:28.939 --> 00:58:29.673 align:middle line:90%
left actually.

00:58:29.673 --> 00:58:30.373 align:middle line:90%
>> Paola: Yeah.

00:58:30.373 --> 00:58:31.508 align:middle line:90%
It's May --

00:58:31.508 --> 00:58:32.409 align:middle line:84%
>> Regina: We've been
chatting for an hour.

00:58:32.409 --> 00:58:33.643 align:middle line:90%
It's gone fast.

00:58:33.643 --> 00:58:34.511 align:middle line:84%
>> Paola: It's May
second through fourth

00:58:34.511 --> 00:58:35.879 align:middle line:90%
at the Clarion Elmhurt.

00:58:35.879 --> 00:58:39.115 align:middle line:84%
It's -- only 150 people
can fit into the ballroom.

00:58:39.115 --> 00:58:41.418 align:middle line:84%
And I have Lee Spiegel of
the "Houghingtonn Post".

00:58:41.418 --> 00:58:46.723 align:middle line:84%
I have Tom -- what's his name --
Fox who did -- what's his name?

00:58:46.723 --> 00:58:48.425 align:middle line:90%
James Fox?

00:58:48.425 --> 00:58:49.259 align:middle line:90%
>> Regina: James Fox.

00:58:49.259 --> 00:58:50.093 align:middle line:90%
>> Paola: James Fox.

00:58:50.093 --> 00:58:51.494 align:middle line:90%
>> Regina: "Out of the Blue".

00:58:51.494 --> 00:58:52.395 align:middle line:84%
>> Paola: Yeah who's
brilliant, "Out of the Blue".

00:58:52.395 --> 00:58:53.496 align:middle line:90%
>> Regina: Yeah.

00:58:53.496 --> 00:58:54.631 align:middle line:84%
>> Paola: And I have
it moderated by CNN --

00:58:54.631 --> 00:58:56.299 align:middle line:90%
ex CNN anchor, Cheryl Jones.

00:58:56.299 --> 00:58:57.901 align:middle line:84%
>> Regina: So you're
really trying to take this

00:58:57.901 --> 00:58:59.369 align:middle line:90%
to a more mainstream --

00:58:59.369 --> 00:59:00.303 align:middle line:90%
>> Paola: Media.

00:59:00.303 --> 00:59:02.038 align:middle line:84%
>> Regina: -- population
and media.

00:59:02.038 --> 00:59:02.772 align:middle line:84%
>> Paola: Yeah I want to talk --
yeah but the problem is media.

00:59:02.772 --> 00:59:04.307 align:middle line:90%
>> Regina: Yeah.

00:59:04.307 --> 00:59:05.875 align:middle line:84%
>> Paola: So the discussion
will be what do we do with this?

00:59:05.875 --> 00:59:07.177 align:middle line:90%
>> Regina: Right.

00:59:07.177 --> 00:59:07.978 align:middle line:84%
>> Paola: How do we deal
with the media in this?

00:59:07.978 --> 00:59:09.245 align:middle line:90%
>> Regina: Right.

00:59:09.245 --> 00:59:10.213 align:middle line:84%
>> Paola: We already
know all the stories.

00:59:10.213 --> 00:59:11.514 align:middle line:90%
>> Regina: Right.

00:59:11.514 --> 00:59:13.516 align:middle line:84%
>> Paola: So I would love to
also have present there --

00:59:13.516 --> 00:59:14.784 align:middle line:84%
and we talked about
him -- Colin Andrews.

00:59:14.784 --> 00:59:16.353 align:middle line:90%
>> Regina: Yes.

00:59:16.353 --> 00:59:16.920 align:middle line:90%
Colin Andrews --

00:59:16.920 --> 00:59:17.520 align:middle line:90%
>> Paola: Okay.

00:59:17.520 --> 00:59:18.922 align:middle line:90%
Okay.

00:59:18.922 --> 00:59:19.756 align:middle line:84%
>> Regina: -- who I'm
trying to get on this show.

00:59:19.756 --> 00:59:20.557 align:middle line:90%
And hopefully soon.

00:59:20.557 --> 00:59:21.658 align:middle line:90%
>> Paola: I know.

00:59:21.658 --> 00:59:22.859 align:middle line:84%
Colin Andrews for
me is brilliant

00:59:22.859 --> 00:59:24.260 align:middle line:84%
because he puts it
all in perspective.

00:59:24.260 --> 00:59:26.730 align:middle line:84%
He's even got the O'Hare
incident in his book called

00:59:26.730 --> 00:59:27.464 align:middle line:90%
"The Edge of Reality".

00:59:27.464 --> 00:59:28.832 align:middle line:90%
>> Regina: Yes.

00:59:28.832 --> 00:59:30.033 align:middle line:84%
And that's a wonderful
book as a matter of fact.

00:59:30.033 --> 00:59:30.767 align:middle line:84%
>> Paola: And that's
a wonderful book.

00:59:30.767 --> 00:59:32.569 align:middle line:90%
>> Regina: Yeah.

00:59:32.569 --> 00:59:34.104 align:middle line:84%
>> Paola: And that's
what I'd like to promote.

00:59:34.104 --> 00:59:35.572 align:middle line:84%
I'd like to promote
colleagues who are scholarly

00:59:35.572 --> 00:59:38.975 align:middle line:84%
and studying this, and have
reached the consciousness.

00:59:38.975 --> 00:59:41.611 align:middle line:84%
And Grant Cameron is
the other one who went

00:59:41.611 --> 00:59:45.382 align:middle line:84%
from Presidential UFOs to
the study of consciousness.

00:59:45.382 --> 00:59:48.151 align:middle line:84%
So that's -- I've
had to progress

00:59:48.151 --> 00:59:49.653 align:middle line:84%
from not even believing
in contact.

00:59:49.653 --> 00:59:53.790 align:middle line:84%
I've had to -- when I was
with Hynek to going to today.

00:59:53.790 --> 00:59:56.559 align:middle line:84%
I mean you have to like
evolve a little bit.

00:59:56.559 --> 01:00:00.563 align:middle line:84%
And so that's where my
passion is right now.

01:00:00.563 --> 01:00:01.865 align:middle line:90%
>> Regina: Yes.

01:00:01.865 --> 01:00:03.767 align:middle line:84%
And once we have that
kind of a track record

01:00:03.767 --> 01:00:06.503 align:middle line:84%
of having evolved
consciousness --

01:00:06.503 --> 01:00:08.338 align:middle line:90%
our own human consciousness --

01:00:08.338 --> 01:00:10.306 align:middle line:84%
I don't think this is going
to be much of an issue.

01:00:10.306 --> 01:00:13.843 align:middle line:84%
Because everyone that views into
the future has been able to see

01:00:13.843 --> 01:00:16.179 align:middle line:84%
that there will come a
day when we and beings

01:00:16.179 --> 01:00:18.548 align:middle line:84%
from other places will
be working side-by-side

01:00:18.548 --> 01:00:20.050 align:middle line:90%
on projects.

01:00:20.050 --> 01:00:21.184 align:middle line:84%
They'll be helping us wherever
they can technologically.

01:00:21.184 --> 01:00:23.319 align:middle line:84%
And they're learning
from us as well.

01:00:23.319 --> 01:00:27.090 align:middle line:84%
To be a human being is
quite an amazing phenomenon

01:00:27.090 --> 01:00:28.024 align:middle line:90%
in and of itself.

01:00:28.024 --> 01:00:29.426 align:middle line:90%
That's a whole other show.

01:00:29.426 --> 01:00:32.796 align:middle line:84%
So with that in mind, I
just want to thank you again

01:00:32.796 --> 01:00:35.665 align:middle line:84%
for the work -- for 30
years of work Paola.

01:00:35.665 --> 01:00:37.667 align:middle line:84%
And I'm glad we've finally
had a chance to connect.

01:00:37.667 --> 01:00:39.669 align:middle line:84%
I've been wanting to do
this for a long time.

01:00:39.669 --> 01:00:40.537 align:middle line:90%
>> Paola: Well thank you.

01:00:40.537 --> 01:00:41.705 align:middle line:90%
It's been a lot of fun.

01:00:41.705 --> 01:00:43.640 align:middle line:90%
And I really support your work.

01:00:43.640 --> 01:00:44.808 align:middle line:90%
You're part of the media!

01:00:44.808 --> 01:00:45.875 align:middle line:84%
>> Regina: Yeah that's
true [chuckles].

01:00:45.875 --> 01:00:47.444 align:middle line:90%
I am indeed.

01:00:47.444 --> 01:00:50.714 align:middle line:84%
