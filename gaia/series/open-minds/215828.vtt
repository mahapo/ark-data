>>REGINA MEREDITH:
Veda Austin is back

00:00:20.720 --> 00:00:22.970 align:middle line:84%
with us, again, to further
our depth of understanding

00:00:22.970 --> 00:00:26.250 align:middle line:84%
about the mysteries of
water and communication.

00:00:26.250 --> 00:00:29.730 align:middle line:84%
Was water the model for the
original written language?

00:00:29.730 --> 00:00:32.750 align:middle line:84%
Is it keeping record of
our astrological movements

00:00:32.750 --> 00:00:33.720 align:middle line:90%
in the cosmos?

00:00:33.720 --> 00:00:35.400 align:middle line:90%
Let's just dig right in.

00:00:35.400 --> 00:00:36.720 align:middle line:90%
It's so good to see you again.

00:00:36.720 --> 00:00:37.860 align:middle line:84%
>>VEDA AUSTIN: It's
so nice to be here.

00:00:37.860 --> 00:00:38.910 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: You've
done really well.

00:00:38.910 --> 00:00:40.950 align:middle line:84%
All kinds of people are
picking up on your work.

00:00:40.950 --> 00:00:44.210 align:middle line:84%
You're labeled as
the new Masaru Emoto.

00:00:44.210 --> 00:00:47.440 align:middle line:90%
That's what's with you.

00:00:47.440 --> 00:00:50.900 align:middle line:84%
You're having very interesting
relationships, developing

00:00:50.900 --> 00:00:52.100 align:middle line:90%
in terms of your research.

00:00:52.100 --> 00:00:53.850 align:middle line:84%
And we're going to go
into a few of those.

00:00:53.850 --> 00:00:56.780 align:middle line:84%
But first, what I'd like to
ask you is, since last saw

00:00:56.780 --> 00:01:00.100 align:middle line:84%
you, what are some of the
really fun, profound things that

00:01:00.100 --> 00:01:04.250 align:middle line:84%
have popped up before we get
in deep into the information?

00:01:04.250 --> 00:01:06.405 align:middle line:10%
>>AUSTIN: Well,
there's been so much.

00:01:06.405 --> 00:01:11.020 align:middle line:10%
I really enjoyed working with
water and the dream time,

00:01:11.020 --> 00:01:14.380 align:middle line:10%
because my question
was, is water conscious?

00:01:14.380 --> 00:01:17.330 align:middle line:10%
Or is my consciousness
impacting the water?

00:01:17.330 --> 00:01:21.200 align:middle line:10%
And I thought, well, when
am I not actively conscious?

00:01:21.200 --> 00:01:22.930 align:middle line:10%
And so I thought,
well, what about when

00:01:22.930 --> 00:01:25.130 align:middle line:10%
I'm asleep, while I'm dreaming?

00:01:25.130 --> 00:01:27.460 align:middle line:84%
And so I would put a
Petri dish of water

00:01:27.460 --> 00:01:29.680 align:middle line:84%
beside my bed with
the intention that it

00:01:29.680 --> 00:01:31.580 align:middle line:90%
captures some part of my dream.

00:01:31.580 --> 00:01:34.430 align:middle line:84%
And then in the morning,
I would wake up.

00:01:34.430 --> 00:01:36.315 align:middle line:84%
And if I knew, I'd
dreamed, you know

00:01:36.315 --> 00:01:38.570 align:middle line:84%
that feeling when
you've had a dream.

00:01:38.570 --> 00:01:41.280 align:middle line:84%
But you're trying to remember
it, and then it just disappears?

00:01:41.280 --> 00:01:42.080 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:01:42.080 --> 00:01:43.960 align:middle line:84%
>>AUSTIN: Those would
be the only time

00:01:43.960 --> 00:01:46.150 align:middle line:84%
that I would freeze the
imagery, because if I

00:01:46.150 --> 00:01:48.550 align:middle line:84%
remembered the dream,
I could be projecting.

00:01:48.550 --> 00:01:54.020 align:middle line:84%
So I had literally dragged
the freezer into the bedroom,

00:01:54.020 --> 00:01:57.890 align:middle line:84%
and I would just put it
straight into the freezer.

00:01:57.890 --> 00:02:00.720 align:middle line:10%
And what was incredible
was that what

00:02:00.720 --> 00:02:04.110 align:middle line:10%
I saw was imagery clearer
than almost anything

00:02:04.110 --> 00:02:06.340 align:middle line:10%
I've seen in the waking state.

00:02:06.340 --> 00:02:08.460 align:middle line:10%
And it was so clear
that it would jog

00:02:08.460 --> 00:02:10.630 align:middle line:10%
my memory of the entire dream.

00:02:10.630 --> 00:02:13.420 align:middle line:10%
And I was able to write
the whole dream down.

00:02:13.420 --> 00:02:14.830 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Oh, that's wonderful.

00:02:14.830 --> 00:02:16.180 align:middle line:90%
>>AUSTIN: It was remarkable.

00:02:16.180 --> 00:02:16.690 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:02:16.690 --> 00:02:18.565 align:middle line:84%
>>AUSTIN: But that made
me then wonder, well,

00:02:18.565 --> 00:02:21.370 align:middle line:84%
how can water accompany
me through the dream time?

00:02:21.370 --> 00:02:25.110 align:middle line:84%
And perhaps it is the
observer, and that

00:02:25.110 --> 00:02:29.710 align:middle line:84%
lends into the Maori word
for spirit, which is wairua.

00:02:29.710 --> 00:02:33.540 align:middle line:84%
It means very rudimentary,
two waters, the physical

00:02:33.540 --> 00:02:35.410 align:middle line:90%
and spiritual waters.

00:02:35.410 --> 00:02:37.690 align:middle line:84%
And then I began
to wonder, well,

00:02:37.690 --> 00:02:41.730 align:middle line:84%
could the observer effect be
one of the spiritual aspects

00:02:41.730 --> 00:02:42.930 align:middle line:90%
of water?

00:02:42.930 --> 00:02:44.580 align:middle line:84%
So that's definitely
been something

00:02:44.580 --> 00:02:46.480 align:middle line:90%
I've been fascinated with.

00:02:46.480 --> 00:02:48.250 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: That's
absolutely fascinating.

00:02:48.250 --> 00:02:49.875 align:middle line:84%
I'm just thinking
about the experiments

00:02:49.875 --> 00:02:53.110 align:middle line:84%
they did many years ago in
Russia about remote viewing,

00:02:53.110 --> 00:02:55.440 align:middle line:84%
and they had decided then,
and they had a lot of people

00:02:55.440 --> 00:02:58.000 align:middle line:84%
around recording this, the
Soviet Academy of Sciences

00:02:58.000 --> 00:02:58.800 align:middle line:90%
and such.

00:02:58.800 --> 00:03:01.850 align:middle line:84%
They noticed that
the clearest viewing

00:03:01.850 --> 00:03:05.940 align:middle line:84%
was into the future, where the
conscious mind wasn't present,

00:03:05.940 --> 00:03:10.170 align:middle line:84%
and manipulating or projecting,
and there was less noise.

00:03:10.170 --> 00:03:12.860 align:middle line:84%
And maybe that's what it's
like in dream time, where

00:03:12.860 --> 00:03:16.200 align:middle line:84%
your conscious mind
isn't projecting.

00:03:16.200 --> 00:03:18.830 align:middle line:84%
You saw the image and thought,
oh my God, that's exactly what--

00:03:18.830 --> 00:03:20.130 align:middle line:90%
I remember the whole thing.

00:03:20.130 --> 00:03:20.987 align:middle line:90%
Now, I love that.

00:03:20.987 --> 00:03:22.320 align:middle line:90%
>>AUSTIN: Oh, it was remarkable.

00:03:22.320 --> 00:03:25.040 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: It's a
real aid to helping

00:03:25.040 --> 00:03:26.585 align:middle line:90%
people remember dreams, too.

00:03:26.585 --> 00:03:28.790 align:middle line:84%
You probably have to put
a freezer and a Petri dish

00:03:28.790 --> 00:03:29.590 align:middle line:90%
in your room.

00:03:29.590 --> 00:03:31.220 align:middle line:90%
>>AUSTIN: It's a process.

00:03:31.220 --> 00:03:34.430 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So let's get
into some of a little bit

00:03:34.430 --> 00:03:37.350 align:middle line:84%
more mechanical aspects
of it, if you will,

00:03:37.350 --> 00:03:38.700 align:middle line:90%
though, it's not dry and boring.

00:03:38.700 --> 00:03:42.380 align:middle line:84%
And that's the notion of liquid
crystal coating, when people

00:03:42.380 --> 00:03:45.080 align:middle line:84%
see these incredible
images, just

00:03:45.080 --> 00:03:47.570 align:middle line:84%
talk about that for a
moment, and we'll move on.

00:03:47.570 --> 00:03:49.520 align:middle line:84%
>>AUSTIN: I think it's
good to know that there

00:03:49.520 --> 00:03:52.220 align:middle line:90%
are three stages of freezing.

00:03:52.220 --> 00:03:55.810 align:middle line:84%
And the first freeze, which
is where I take water out

00:03:55.810 --> 00:03:59.900 align:middle line:84%
is when water has literally
just begun to freeze.

00:03:59.900 --> 00:04:02.720 align:middle line:84%
There is liquid on top
and ice underneath.

00:04:02.720 --> 00:04:06.610 align:middle line:84%
The second freeze is where it's
like a water sandwich stuck

00:04:06.610 --> 00:04:08.690 align:middle line:90%
between two layers of ice.

00:04:08.690 --> 00:04:10.280 align:middle line:90%
And then there is a solid.

00:04:10.280 --> 00:04:13.150 align:middle line:84%
I think of them like
spirit blood and body.

00:04:13.150 --> 00:04:17.839 align:middle line:10%
Liquid crystal is not exactly
a solid, and it's not a liquid.

00:04:17.839 --> 00:04:22.010 align:middle line:84%
It is in a stage between
the two, more like plasma.

00:04:22.010 --> 00:04:25.430 align:middle line:84%
And it has an ordered
molecular structure.

00:04:25.430 --> 00:04:28.150 align:middle line:84%
It absorbs more light,
it has negative charge,

00:04:28.150 --> 00:04:29.960 align:middle line:90%
and it has viscosity.

00:04:29.960 --> 00:04:34.030 align:middle line:84%
A wonderful example of
it as a liquid crystal

00:04:34.030 --> 00:04:36.400 align:middle line:84%
would be a fellow
crystallographer

00:04:36.400 --> 00:04:40.450 align:middle line:84%
who learned my freezing method
was using a glass baking

00:04:40.450 --> 00:04:42.620 align:middle line:90%
dish, instead of a Petri dish.

00:04:42.620 --> 00:04:44.170 align:middle line:90%
And anyone can do that.

00:04:44.170 --> 00:04:47.480 align:middle line:84%
And she had this beautiful
crystallography that had formed.

00:04:47.480 --> 00:04:51.520 align:middle line:84%
And as she was holding
the dish up vertically,

00:04:51.520 --> 00:04:55.590 align:middle line:84%
the ice naturally
started to move downward.

00:04:55.590 --> 00:05:00.750 align:middle line:84%
But rather than just evaporate
and disappear or become liquid,

00:05:00.750 --> 00:05:04.850 align:middle line:84%
it actually scrolled upon
itself to create an ice

00:05:04.850 --> 00:05:07.400 align:middle line:84%
scroll with all
of the information

00:05:07.400 --> 00:05:09.960 align:middle line:90%
or design still on it.

00:05:09.960 --> 00:05:13.550 align:middle line:84%
So in the liquid crystal
state, what we're seeing

00:05:13.550 --> 00:05:18.170 align:middle line:84%
is the most pure
information that water

00:05:18.170 --> 00:05:21.800 align:middle line:90%
has absorbed and shared.

00:05:21.800 --> 00:05:23.900 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And you
say sometimes this

00:05:23.900 --> 00:05:27.285 align:middle line:84%
can almost look like
hieroglyphics or cuneiform.

00:05:27.285 --> 00:05:28.160 align:middle line:90%
>>AUSTIN: Absolutely.

00:05:28.160 --> 00:05:30.560 align:middle line:84%
So this is one of the things
I'm really excited about.

00:05:30.560 --> 00:05:37.010 align:middle line:84%
So I have been working with
words, the written word.

00:05:37.010 --> 00:05:41.780 align:middle line:84%
And what I've discovered is
that there is an energy that

00:05:41.780 --> 00:05:44.120 align:middle line:90%
comes from the written word.

00:05:44.120 --> 00:05:47.910 align:middle line:84%
And when you put the
water on top of that word,

00:05:47.910 --> 00:05:50.720 align:middle line:84%
remove and freeze,
and you repeat

00:05:50.720 --> 00:05:55.690 align:middle line:84%
that, what I found is that
I see the same symbol appear

00:05:55.690 --> 00:05:57.680 align:middle line:90%
over and over and over again.

00:05:57.680 --> 00:06:00.640 align:middle line:84%
And for me, it has to
be at least 50 times.

00:06:00.640 --> 00:06:04.360 align:middle line:84%
And that means that I now
have a symbol for the energy

00:06:04.360 --> 00:06:05.810 align:middle line:90%
of the word I wrote.

00:06:05.810 --> 00:06:09.760 align:middle line:84%
Now, when I write the word
information, what I see

00:06:09.760 --> 00:06:14.410 align:middle line:84%
is imagery that looks
just like coding.

00:06:14.410 --> 00:06:15.910 align:middle line:84%
What's even more
interesting to me--

00:06:15.910 --> 00:06:18.590 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Coding as in computer
coding, ones and zeros?

00:06:18.590 --> 00:06:19.700 align:middle line:90%
>>AUSTIN: No.

00:06:19.700 --> 00:06:21.010 align:middle line:90%
Although, a little bit.

00:06:21.010 --> 00:06:23.240 align:middle line:84%
Actually, much more
like ancient language.

00:06:23.240 --> 00:06:24.040 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: OK.

00:06:24.040 --> 00:06:28.240 align:middle line:84%
>>AUSTIN: A little bit like
a cross between Sumerian,

00:06:28.240 --> 00:06:31.785 align:middle line:84%
the cuneiform, hieroglyphs,
and even Arabic.

00:06:31.785 --> 00:06:33.220 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Uh-hmm.

00:06:33.220 --> 00:06:36.820 align:middle line:84%
>>AUSTIN: And when I showed
this to a friend of mine who's

00:06:36.820 --> 00:06:38.550 align:middle line:84%
an archaeologist,
he was like, oh,

00:06:38.550 --> 00:06:40.640 align:middle line:84%
my God, that's an
ancient language.

00:06:40.640 --> 00:06:42.700 align:middle line:84%
We can probably
figure out what this

00:06:42.700 --> 00:06:44.920 align:middle line:84%
means, if we can
get enough of these

00:06:44.920 --> 00:06:47.120 align:middle line:84%
and start putting
them into categories.

00:06:47.120 --> 00:06:49.700 align:middle line:84%
And that's actually
what I'm starting to do.

00:06:49.700 --> 00:06:51.790 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: That's fascinating.

00:06:51.790 --> 00:06:57.670 align:middle line:84%
You say one of the
images was identified

00:06:57.670 --> 00:06:59.960 align:middle line:90%
by AI as an ancient language.

00:06:59.960 --> 00:07:02.010 align:middle line:90%
So let's get into all of that.

00:07:02.010 --> 00:07:02.810 align:middle line:90%
>>AUSTIN: Yeah.

00:07:02.810 --> 00:07:04.790 align:middle line:90%
That was a surprise to me.

00:07:04.790 --> 00:07:08.360 align:middle line:84%
So I was recently at the Annual
Water Conference in Portugal,

00:07:08.360 --> 00:07:09.370 align:middle line:90%
where I gave a talk.

00:07:09.370 --> 00:07:13.570 align:middle line:84%
And one of the scientists
there took a snapshot

00:07:13.570 --> 00:07:19.750 align:middle line:84%
of my presentation, and it had
pictures of the information

00:07:19.750 --> 00:07:24.880 align:middle line:84%
hydroglyph compared to
both Sumerian cuneiform

00:07:24.880 --> 00:07:26.660 align:middle line:90%
and hieroglyphs.

00:07:26.660 --> 00:07:31.390 align:middle line:84%
And when he put
that image into AI,

00:07:31.390 --> 00:07:35.920 align:middle line:84%
he asked AI to, essentially,
tell him what it saw.

00:07:35.920 --> 00:07:40.390 align:middle line:84%
And it identified
the ancient language.

00:07:40.390 --> 00:07:45.280 align:middle line:84%
And then he said, focus
on the images of mine.

00:07:45.280 --> 00:07:49.670 align:middle line:84%
And when AI did that, it
actually identified some of them

00:07:49.670 --> 00:07:54.560 align:middle line:84%
as Sumerian cuneiform
and hieroglyphs.

00:07:54.560 --> 00:07:56.010 align:middle line:90%
And that was remarkable.

00:07:56.010 --> 00:07:59.300 align:middle line:84%
And it went on to say
that it looked very, very

00:07:59.300 --> 00:08:01.050 align:middle line:90%
much like an ancient language.

00:08:01.050 --> 00:08:06.260 align:middle line:84%
And the potential of that
is that this could be a way

00:08:06.260 --> 00:08:09.240 align:middle line:90%
to communicate with all life.

00:08:09.240 --> 00:08:12.620 align:middle line:84%
It could well be a
universal language.

00:08:12.620 --> 00:08:15.830 align:middle line:84%
And I've used words
as my Rosetta Stone

00:08:15.830 --> 00:08:18.270 align:middle line:84%
to understand what
these symbols mean.

00:08:18.270 --> 00:08:21.600 align:middle line:84%
But what is the most interesting
thing about the information,

00:08:21.600 --> 00:08:25.280 align:middle line:84%
or this coding that we're
talking about, is that 8 times

00:08:25.280 --> 00:08:29.600 align:middle line:84%
out of 10, whether I'm using
that word or not, myself,

00:08:29.600 --> 00:08:33.350 align:middle line:84%
and pretty much anyone
else can see it.

00:08:33.350 --> 00:08:36.380 align:middle line:84%
At least 8 out of
10 people will see

00:08:36.380 --> 00:08:41.159 align:middle line:84%
this particular design, which
makes me start to think,

00:08:41.159 --> 00:08:43.850 align:middle line:84%
hang on, maybe what
we're actually seeing

00:08:43.850 --> 00:08:49.600 align:middle line:84%
is water sharing its
information updates constantly.

00:08:49.600 --> 00:08:53.140 align:middle line:84%
This is why I think that it
is the potential storehouse

00:08:53.140 --> 00:08:56.120 align:middle line:90%
for the Akashic Records.

00:08:56.120 --> 00:08:57.740 align:middle line:90%
And that's a big deal.

00:08:57.740 --> 00:09:00.040 align:middle line:84%
And I've always thought if
the Akashic Records were

00:09:00.040 --> 00:09:02.180 align:middle line:84%
to be stored in anything,
it would be water,

00:09:02.180 --> 00:09:05.060 align:middle line:84%
because water is not
limited to one stage.

00:09:05.060 --> 00:09:08.200 align:middle line:84%
And I think there are far more
stages than liquid, solid, gas,

00:09:08.200 --> 00:09:10.813 align:middle line:90%
and gel.

00:09:10.813 --> 00:09:12.980 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: This opens up a
whole bunch of ways to go,

00:09:12.980 --> 00:09:16.480 align:middle line:84%
but one of them is when
you ask for information

00:09:16.480 --> 00:09:19.310 align:middle line:84%
and showing you the ancient
language of Sumerian,

00:09:19.310 --> 00:09:25.060 align:middle line:84%
for example, cuneiform,
you say that you

00:09:25.060 --> 00:09:29.380 align:middle line:84%
take the pictures enough that
you'll know what that word means

00:09:29.380 --> 00:09:30.800 align:middle line:90%
in that language as well.

00:09:30.800 --> 00:09:33.670 align:middle line:84%
So it's also helping
decipher cuneiform

00:09:33.670 --> 00:09:38.973 align:middle line:84%
in a new way beyond what the
academics of old have done?

00:09:38.973 --> 00:09:41.140 align:middle line:84%
>>AUSTIN: Well, it certainly
can head that direction

00:09:41.140 --> 00:09:41.940 align:middle line:90%
at the moment.

00:09:41.940 --> 00:09:44.030 align:middle line:84%
All I know is that
with the written word,

00:09:44.030 --> 00:09:45.580 align:middle line:90%
it means information.

00:09:45.580 --> 00:09:50.260 align:middle line:84%
What we're starting to do
with actually the help of AI

00:09:50.260 --> 00:09:53.480 align:middle line:84%
is feeding ancient
language into AI,

00:09:53.480 --> 00:09:54.950 align:middle line:84%
so it knows what
it's looking for.

00:09:54.950 --> 00:10:00.280 align:middle line:10%
And it will help basically
decipher any recognizable ice

00:10:00.280 --> 00:10:04.415 align:middle line:10%
imagery in the crystallography.

00:10:04.415 --> 00:10:05.540 align:middle line:10%
>>REGINA: It's fascinating.

00:10:05.540 --> 00:10:07.040 align:middle line:10%
>>AUSTIN: The other
potential for it

00:10:07.040 --> 00:10:11.650 align:middle line:10%
is that we could potentially
use this to decipher

00:10:11.650 --> 00:10:16.270 align:middle line:10%
unknown ancient languages.

00:10:16.270 --> 00:10:19.670 align:middle line:84%
I think it's called Rongorongo
that is on Easter Island.

00:10:19.670 --> 00:10:23.270 align:middle line:84%
They have a written language
that no one's deciphered yet.

00:10:23.270 --> 00:10:25.630 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: That would have
been from Lemurian times, most

00:10:25.630 --> 00:10:29.470 align:middle line:84%
likely, if there was a written
language at that time, that's

00:10:29.470 --> 00:10:30.500 align:middle line:90%
a remnant of it.

00:10:30.500 --> 00:10:33.410 align:middle line:84%
>>AUSTIN: And if it was, it
would be a language of symbols.

00:10:33.410 --> 00:10:34.210 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:10:34.210 --> 00:10:38.140 align:middle line:84%
>>AUSTIN: Because it's like
water takes the written word,

00:10:38.140 --> 00:10:42.740 align:middle line:84%
reverse engineers it into
some kind of living symbol.

00:10:42.740 --> 00:10:45.890 align:middle line:84%
Because when I ask what, that
might sound a little out there

00:10:45.890 --> 00:10:47.900 align:middle line:84%
for some people, but
I'm not limited to what

00:10:47.900 --> 00:10:50.640 align:middle line:90%
I can do with this technique.

00:10:50.640 --> 00:10:52.970 align:middle line:84%
When I've asked water,
what is a hydroglyph, which

00:10:52.970 --> 00:10:54.920 align:middle line:90%
is what I call these symbols--

00:10:54.920 --> 00:10:55.860 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Hydroglyphs.

00:10:55.860 --> 00:10:58.500 align:middle line:84%
>>AUSTIN: --it responded
into hydroglyphs.

00:10:58.500 --> 00:11:01.320 align:middle line:84%
One was living and
one was message.

00:11:01.320 --> 00:11:03.030 align:middle line:90%
So they are living messages.

00:11:03.030 --> 00:11:04.113 align:middle line:90%
They're not just messages.

00:11:04.113 --> 00:11:06.630 align:middle line:90%


00:11:06.630 --> 00:11:09.590 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So now we're getting
into the level of consciousness

00:11:09.590 --> 00:11:10.700 align:middle line:90%
when we're creating.

00:11:10.700 --> 00:11:14.100 align:middle line:84%
And you have your conscious
mind that's working with them.

00:11:14.100 --> 00:11:17.400 align:middle line:84%
But like you say, in dream time,
that's not your conscious mind.

00:11:17.400 --> 00:11:19.250 align:middle line:84%
So what are you
looking at in terms

00:11:19.250 --> 00:11:24.883 align:middle line:84%
of the quality of consciousness
with higher mind and water now?

00:11:24.883 --> 00:11:26.550 align:middle line:84%
>>AUSTIN: Well, that's
a great question.

00:11:26.550 --> 00:11:30.110 align:middle line:84%
And I don't think you
can look past that.

00:11:30.110 --> 00:11:36.570 align:middle line:84%
Once you start realizing
that this is potentially

00:11:36.570 --> 00:11:41.300 align:middle line:84%
an intelligence within
water, I think that then you

00:11:41.300 --> 00:11:43.570 align:middle line:84%
start having to ask the
very important question

00:11:43.570 --> 00:11:44.900 align:middle line:90%
is, what is water?

00:11:44.900 --> 00:11:47.690 align:middle line:84%
It has been the first
question I ever asked,

00:11:47.690 --> 00:11:51.730 align:middle line:84%
and it is still
the question I ask.

00:11:51.730 --> 00:11:55.970 align:middle line:84%
Could water be an intelligent
designer is very interesting.

00:11:55.970 --> 00:11:59.680 align:middle line:84%
And one of the ways in which I
have come to ask that question

00:11:59.680 --> 00:12:02.680 align:middle line:84%
and think that that's
definitely possible,

00:12:02.680 --> 00:12:07.930 align:middle line:84%
is that whenever I put
water on top of an image,

00:12:07.930 --> 00:12:11.630 align:middle line:84%
it doesn't design a
photocopy of that image.

00:12:11.630 --> 00:12:15.730 align:middle line:10%
It designs an artistic
expression of that image.

00:12:15.730 --> 00:12:17.390 align:middle line:90%
Now, that's profound.

00:12:17.390 --> 00:12:18.850 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: It is
because I noticed

00:12:18.850 --> 00:12:22.750 align:middle line:84%
in a couple of yours, one of
them, I remember was a face.

00:12:22.750 --> 00:12:26.620 align:middle line:84%
It showed the face
nicely, but it showed it

00:12:26.620 --> 00:12:29.680 align:middle line:84%
actually having
moved and looking

00:12:29.680 --> 00:12:32.510 align:middle line:84%
slightly different at a
slightly different angle.

00:12:32.510 --> 00:12:35.530 align:middle line:84%
And I thought, why
would it be doing that?

00:12:35.530 --> 00:12:37.960 align:middle line:84%
>>AUSTIN: Well, you see,
I think that water sees us

00:12:37.960 --> 00:12:40.680 align:middle line:84%
in an entirely different
way than we do.

00:12:40.680 --> 00:12:42.940 align:middle line:84%
And I know that might
sound strange to you,

00:12:42.940 --> 00:12:44.440 align:middle line:90%
that water sees us.

00:12:44.440 --> 00:12:47.560 align:middle line:84%
But water is always in
communication with itself.

00:12:47.560 --> 00:12:51.760 align:middle line:84%
Water within us, as a
fluid, and water in the air.

00:12:51.760 --> 00:12:55.140 align:middle line:84%
Water in the air is attracted
to electrical charge.

00:12:55.140 --> 00:12:58.240 align:middle line:84%
And the fact that we breathe out
means there's water in the air.

00:12:58.240 --> 00:13:02.100 align:middle line:84%
And that actually
explains intuition.

00:13:02.100 --> 00:13:06.750 align:middle line:84%
By that I mean that the
water in the air that

00:13:06.750 --> 00:13:08.820 align:middle line:84%
is attracted to your
electrical charge on a very

00:13:08.820 --> 00:13:14.550 align:middle line:84%
minute and subtle level is
able to probe into areas

00:13:14.550 --> 00:13:15.580 align:middle line:90%
we can't see.

00:13:15.580 --> 00:13:16.380 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:13:16.380 --> 00:13:17.350 align:middle line:90%
Absolutely.

00:13:17.350 --> 00:13:20.340 align:middle line:84%
>>AUSTIN: And it brings
that information into us

00:13:20.340 --> 00:13:22.900 align:middle line:90%
as an intuitive hurt.

00:13:22.900 --> 00:13:24.670 align:middle line:84%
And when we don't
listen to our intuition,

00:13:24.670 --> 00:13:25.880 align:middle line:90%
we always wish we had.

00:13:25.880 --> 00:13:26.680 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:13:26.680 --> 00:13:29.560 align:middle line:84%
>>AUSTIN: And so water is not
limited to time and space.

00:13:29.560 --> 00:13:33.070 align:middle line:84%
I've put my thumb into the
water, removed and froze,

00:13:33.070 --> 00:13:35.880 align:middle line:84%
seen the thumb and the nail, but
there was a chip in the nail.

00:13:35.880 --> 00:13:38.100 align:middle line:84%
And I chipped my nail in
exactly the same place

00:13:38.100 --> 00:13:40.850 align:middle line:90%
three hours later.

00:13:40.850 --> 00:13:43.410 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Again, that
beyond time and space thing.

00:13:43.410 --> 00:13:44.340 align:middle line:90%
>>AUSTIN: Exactly.

00:13:44.340 --> 00:13:50.480 align:middle line:84%
So bringing that back to
this intelligent designer,

00:13:50.480 --> 00:13:55.610 align:middle line:84%
then it could well be that
all life, no matter what

00:13:55.610 --> 00:14:01.310 align:middle line:84%
that life is having a
communication system that

00:14:01.310 --> 00:14:08.450 align:middle line:84%
is through fluids, speaking
to other aspects of water.

00:14:08.450 --> 00:14:11.780 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So the origin
of the mind of water

00:14:11.780 --> 00:14:15.650 align:middle line:84%
-becomes kind of interesting-
is it programming itself?

00:14:15.650 --> 00:14:19.880 align:middle line:84%
Or is it simply
so fluid, so open

00:14:19.880 --> 00:14:23.510 align:middle line:84%
and receptive that it's
working with the unconscious

00:14:23.510 --> 00:14:27.110 align:middle line:84%
layers of not only human mind,
but other mind, creative mind

00:14:27.110 --> 00:14:29.862 align:middle line:90%
in general?

00:14:29.862 --> 00:14:31.320 align:middle line:84%
>>AUSTIN: When I
think about water,

00:14:31.320 --> 00:14:35.480 align:middle line:84%
I have to think about light,
and this comes into that.

00:14:35.480 --> 00:14:40.230 align:middle line:84%
I often asked, what is
water, as I mentioned.

00:14:40.230 --> 00:14:43.110 align:middle line:84%
And one of the most profound
things I have learned

00:14:43.110 --> 00:14:45.760 align:middle line:84%
is that water is actually
only one part of matter.

00:14:45.760 --> 00:14:48.270 align:middle line:84%
The matter is the two
hydrogens and oxygen.

00:14:48.270 --> 00:14:54.000 align:middle line:84%
And the rest is photonic light
that makes water a light house.

00:14:54.000 --> 00:14:59.020 align:middle line:84%
Inside of our bodies are
trillions of water molecules.

00:14:59.020 --> 00:15:01.620 align:middle line:84%
In fact, there are more
water molecules in our bodies

00:15:01.620 --> 00:15:04.200 align:middle line:84%
than all the stars in
the perceivable universe.

00:15:04.200 --> 00:15:05.000 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Uh-hmm.

00:15:05.000 --> 00:15:09.390 align:middle line:84%
>>AUSTIN: And all of them
contain more light than anything

00:15:09.390 --> 00:15:10.890 align:middle line:90%
else.

00:15:10.890 --> 00:15:15.150 align:middle line:84%
And there was once somebody
that said to me, what if water

00:15:15.150 --> 00:15:21.600 align:middle line:84%
is expressing consciousness or
divine consciousness through us,

00:15:21.600 --> 00:15:24.030 align:middle line:84%
and every living thing
to observe itself

00:15:24.030 --> 00:15:28.170 align:middle line:84%
from every perceivable and
imperceivable perspective?

00:15:28.170 --> 00:15:30.273 align:middle line:84%
And I thought that
was really profound.

00:15:30.273 --> 00:15:33.480 align:middle line:90%


00:15:33.480 --> 00:15:35.450 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: In that case,
would water, again,

00:15:35.450 --> 00:15:37.753 align:middle line:84%
be the originator
or the carrier?

00:15:37.753 --> 00:15:41.390 align:middle line:90%


00:15:41.390 --> 00:15:44.070 align:middle line:84%
>>AUSTIN: There's many things
I can't say I know for sure.

00:15:44.070 --> 00:15:44.870 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:15:44.870 --> 00:15:47.820 align:middle line:84%
No, this just becomes
philosophical a little bit.

00:15:47.820 --> 00:15:49.335 align:middle line:90%
This is exploratory anyway.

00:15:49.335 --> 00:15:50.210 align:middle line:90%
>>AUSTIN: Absolutely.

00:15:50.210 --> 00:15:54.440 align:middle line:84%
But I would suggest that
water and consciousness are so

00:15:54.440 --> 00:15:57.330 align:middle line:84%
intimately intertwined
that they behave as one,

00:15:57.330 --> 00:16:02.180 align:middle line:84%
and that water in
its multiple forms,

00:16:02.180 --> 00:16:10.370 align:middle line:84%
essentially could well
be the original divine

00:16:10.370 --> 00:16:14.540 align:middle line:90%
messenger of life.

00:16:14.540 --> 00:16:18.110 align:middle line:84%
It's like it's seeding
life, wherever it goes.

00:16:18.110 --> 00:16:24.110 align:middle line:84%
And even upon death, you
could say that anyone who

00:16:24.110 --> 00:16:27.470 align:middle line:84%
has been able to see
spirit leave, many of them

00:16:27.470 --> 00:16:31.640 align:middle line:84%
say they saw it like
a cloud, or a vapor,

00:16:31.640 --> 00:16:35.870 align:middle line:84%
or a mist, which are
all watery forms.

00:16:35.870 --> 00:16:39.320 align:middle line:84%
I think it could well be
like a vibrational vapor,

00:16:39.320 --> 00:16:42.560 align:middle line:84%
a state of water, we just
haven't discovered yet.

00:16:42.560 --> 00:16:46.610 align:middle line:84%
And that leads into
water as an observer.

00:16:46.610 --> 00:16:50.260 align:middle line:84%
So once a soul leaves
a body, many people

00:16:50.260 --> 00:16:51.760 align:middle line:84%
that have had
near-death experiences

00:16:51.760 --> 00:16:55.220 align:middle line:84%
say that they now observe their
body with no attachment to it.

00:16:55.220 --> 00:16:59.560 align:middle line:84%
And they have a very
vast view of the world

00:16:59.560 --> 00:17:03.260 align:middle line:84%
and the universe of which they
had never imagined before.

00:17:03.260 --> 00:17:06.010 align:middle line:84%
So they become this
observer before they go on

00:17:06.010 --> 00:17:08.329 align:middle line:90%
to have other experiences.

00:17:08.329 --> 00:17:12.730 align:middle line:84%
It could well be that the
spirit of consciousness

00:17:12.730 --> 00:17:16.550 align:middle line:84%
is carried through
this vaporous stage,

00:17:16.550 --> 00:17:21.940 align:middle line:84%
or it could even be the waters
that hold our consciousness

00:17:21.940 --> 00:17:24.688 align:middle line:84%
and are connected to the
divine consciousness.

00:17:24.688 --> 00:17:25.730 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: I believe that.

00:17:25.730 --> 00:17:28.750 align:middle line:84%
And I have often thought
that this planet, being

00:17:28.750 --> 00:17:32.610 align:middle line:84%
made of water, is a gigantic
receiver and possibly

00:17:32.610 --> 00:17:35.310 align:middle line:84%
transmitter, of course,
on the other side of that,

00:17:35.310 --> 00:17:38.940 align:middle line:84%
of all cosmic information,
that's where it's held.

00:17:38.940 --> 00:17:40.293 align:middle line:90%
It's in the Earth's waters.

00:17:40.293 --> 00:17:42.210 align:middle line:84%
And we're going to get
to that in a little bit

00:17:42.210 --> 00:17:45.760 align:middle line:84%
because we're going to talk
about the astrological aspect.

00:17:45.760 --> 00:17:50.740 align:middle line:84%
I'm just digging, pulling
back the layers, I suppose,

00:17:50.740 --> 00:17:55.570 align:middle line:84%
and thinking, if supposedly,
according to ancient texts

00:17:55.570 --> 00:18:00.690 align:middle line:90%
in the beginning was the word.

00:18:00.690 --> 00:18:04.510 align:middle line:84%
And then there
was prima materia.

00:18:04.510 --> 00:18:08.500 align:middle line:84%
Prima materia,
which was the soup,

00:18:08.500 --> 00:18:13.500 align:middle line:84%
the considered chaotic energy
that was given order by the word

00:18:13.500 --> 00:18:19.240 align:middle line:84%
to begin manifesting in various
dimensions, various densities,

00:18:19.240 --> 00:18:24.210 align:middle line:84%
looking at it as the original
thought, the word prima

00:18:24.210 --> 00:18:30.100 align:middle line:84%
materia, the sea of chaos, where
does water filter down in that?

00:18:30.100 --> 00:18:33.230 align:middle line:84%
Where does water
become the main player

00:18:33.230 --> 00:18:37.430 align:middle line:90%
of carrying the consciousness?

00:18:37.430 --> 00:18:40.040 align:middle line:84%
>>AUSTIN: It is important
to look at that question

00:18:40.040 --> 00:18:42.090 align:middle line:90%
and take it apart a little bit.

00:18:42.090 --> 00:18:42.890 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Uh-hmm.

00:18:42.890 --> 00:18:46.320 align:middle line:84%
>>AUSTIN: And the word is
a really interesting one,

00:18:46.320 --> 00:18:51.890 align:middle line:84%
because what I'm seeing
is that that creates water

00:18:51.890 --> 00:18:54.920 align:middle line:90%
to go into form.

00:18:54.920 --> 00:18:56.460 align:middle line:84%
The word has a very
powerful thing.

00:18:56.460 --> 00:18:56.750 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:18:56.750 --> 00:18:58.400 align:middle line:84%
Just like prima
materia, just like

00:18:58.400 --> 00:19:01.550 align:middle line:84%
pure energy, pure field
of energy and thought.

00:19:01.550 --> 00:19:04.040 align:middle line:84%
>>AUSTIN: And in the
Bible it talks about,

00:19:04.040 --> 00:19:06.620 align:middle line:84%
the spirit, and
the spirit of God

00:19:06.620 --> 00:19:09.260 align:middle line:84%
hovered over the
face of the deep.

00:19:09.260 --> 00:19:13.320 align:middle line:90%
And from there, became sound.

00:19:13.320 --> 00:19:15.210 align:middle line:84%
And from sound,
there's cymatics.

00:19:15.210 --> 00:19:18.480 align:middle line:84%
And where there's
movement, there's waves,

00:19:18.480 --> 00:19:20.870 align:middle line:90%
but you can't take out light.

00:19:20.870 --> 00:19:23.190 align:middle line:90%
So water holds the light.

00:19:23.190 --> 00:19:24.860 align:middle line:90%
It is the light bearer.

00:19:24.860 --> 00:19:29.540 align:middle line:84%
And within that,
consciousness is held.

00:19:29.540 --> 00:19:32.070 align:middle line:84%
You talk about the
Akashic Records.

00:19:32.070 --> 00:19:35.000 align:middle line:84%
It's interesting to
know that the word is

00:19:35.000 --> 00:19:40.470 align:middle line:84%
derived from a Sanskrit word,
meaning, atmosphere, ether,

00:19:40.470 --> 00:19:42.200 align:middle line:90%
and sky.

00:19:42.200 --> 00:19:49.190 align:middle line:84%
Those three words can all
relate to aspects of water.

00:19:49.190 --> 00:19:51.740 align:middle line:84%
And so when you're
starting to look

00:19:51.740 --> 00:19:55.370 align:middle line:84%
at this divine consciousness,
I don't think that you can ever

00:19:55.370 --> 00:19:58.070 align:middle line:90%
take water out of the equation.

00:19:58.070 --> 00:20:01.610 align:middle line:84%
Look at hydrogen. Hydrogen
literally means the creator

00:20:01.610 --> 00:20:03.890 align:middle line:90%
of water-- hydro and Genesis.

00:20:03.890 --> 00:20:05.340 align:middle line:90%
Then you look at the sun.

00:20:05.340 --> 00:20:07.500 align:middle line:90%
The sun evaporates the water.

00:20:07.500 --> 00:20:10.310 align:middle line:84%
It's like taking its
children back home.

00:20:10.310 --> 00:20:14.030 align:middle line:84%
When you look at creation,
there is no creation

00:20:14.030 --> 00:20:16.775 align:middle line:90%
without a water story.

00:20:16.775 --> 00:20:18.420 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: In the
material universes.

00:20:18.420 --> 00:20:19.220 align:middle line:90%
>>AUSTIN: Yes

00:20:19.220 --> 00:20:20.020 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:20:20.020 --> 00:20:22.070 align:middle line:84%
>>AUSTIN: But then, you
look out in the universe

00:20:22.070 --> 00:20:25.670 align:middle line:90%
and hydrogen is everywhere.

00:20:25.670 --> 00:20:31.360 align:middle line:84%
And I think that once water and
oxygen come together and light,

00:20:31.360 --> 00:20:36.400 align:middle line:84%
they create this beautiful
thing that we call water,

00:20:36.400 --> 00:20:40.300 align:middle line:84%
but yet we barely
know anything about.

00:20:40.300 --> 00:20:43.930 align:middle line:84%
That amazes me that we
know so little about water,

00:20:43.930 --> 00:20:46.870 align:middle line:84%
and it makes very little
sense to so many people.

00:20:46.870 --> 00:20:49.040 align:middle line:84%
It defies the laws of
physics and gravity.

00:20:49.040 --> 00:20:50.790 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And yet every
single human being

00:20:50.790 --> 00:20:53.470 align:middle line:84%
knows what it's like to
be in contact with water,

00:20:53.470 --> 00:20:56.310 align:middle line:84%
to be in water,
seeking vacation spots.

00:20:56.310 --> 00:20:59.100 align:middle line:84%
So you can be near the water
or in the water, the soothing

00:20:59.100 --> 00:21:03.840 align:middle line:84%
elements of it, we all feel
the healing capabilities of it.

00:21:03.840 --> 00:21:06.260 align:middle line:84%
We know we can't
survive without it.

00:21:06.260 --> 00:21:07.060 align:middle line:90%
You're right.

00:21:07.060 --> 00:21:08.740 align:middle line:84%
I don't know much
about it other than.

00:21:08.740 --> 00:21:10.360 align:middle line:84%
Well, it was warm,
it felt great.

00:21:10.360 --> 00:21:12.450 align:middle line:90%
And there were some waves today.

00:21:12.450 --> 00:21:15.370 align:middle line:84%
>>AUSTIN: But without
the study of water,

00:21:15.370 --> 00:21:18.300 align:middle line:84%
we're missing out on the study
of what it is to be alive.

00:21:18.300 --> 00:21:19.100 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:21:19.100 --> 00:21:20.392 align:middle line:90%
>>AUSTIN: You know what we say?

00:21:20.392 --> 00:21:23.070 align:middle line:84%
There is no life without
water, but we never

00:21:23.070 --> 00:21:25.260 align:middle line:84%
look at the
possibility that water

00:21:25.260 --> 00:21:28.020 align:middle line:90%
could be that living quality.

00:21:28.020 --> 00:21:32.130 align:middle line:84%
That water could potentially
be what we might term as alive.

00:21:32.130 --> 00:21:33.345 align:middle line:90%
It is moving.

00:21:33.345 --> 00:21:36.080 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Oh, absolutely.

00:21:36.080 --> 00:21:38.038 align:middle line:84%
>>AUSTIN: Through my
work, I have over 64,000--

00:21:38.038 --> 00:21:38.872 align:middle line:90%
[INTERPOSING VOICES]

00:21:38.872 --> 00:21:40.340 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: It has so much memory.

00:21:40.340 --> 00:21:41.215 align:middle line:90%
>>AUSTIN: Absolutely.

00:21:41.215 --> 00:21:42.015 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:21:42.015 --> 00:21:44.750 align:middle line:84%
>>AUSTIN: But then I
wonder, is it water memory?

00:21:44.750 --> 00:21:46.680 align:middle line:90%
Or is it water dreaming?

00:21:46.680 --> 00:21:48.480 align:middle line:90%
Is it water imagining?

00:21:48.480 --> 00:21:50.730 align:middle line:84%
Because what is not
stuck in time and space,

00:21:50.730 --> 00:21:52.230 align:middle line:90%
is it only remembering?

00:21:52.230 --> 00:21:55.190 align:middle line:84%
Or is it something in
between, something different?

00:21:55.190 --> 00:21:57.770 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Let's talk about
something super practical,

00:21:57.770 --> 00:21:59.460 align:middle line:90%
like homeopathics.

00:21:59.460 --> 00:22:01.223 align:middle line:90%
>>AUSTIN: Yes.

00:22:01.223 --> 00:22:02.890 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: A couple
hundred years ago, it

00:22:02.890 --> 00:22:06.200 align:middle line:84%
was understood that water
was the ultimate in receiving

00:22:06.200 --> 00:22:09.550 align:middle line:84%
and storing information
beyond any chemical compound.

00:22:09.550 --> 00:22:14.330 align:middle line:90%


00:22:14.330 --> 00:22:18.890 align:middle line:84%
It's still fascinating to me
that by programming the water

00:22:18.890 --> 00:22:20.960 align:middle line:84%
and potentizing it
so that you have not

00:22:20.960 --> 00:22:26.560 align:middle line:84%
even one atom of the original or
molecule of the original element

00:22:26.560 --> 00:22:28.450 align:middle line:84%
there that programmed
it, You have

00:22:28.450 --> 00:22:34.510 align:middle line:84%
an even more potent cure with
just the memory of the water.

00:22:34.510 --> 00:22:37.690 align:middle line:84%
>>AUSTIN: Well, I think of that,
again, coming back to spirit,

00:22:37.690 --> 00:22:42.920 align:middle line:84%
if, for example, the remedy was
Bach flower or something, well,

00:22:42.920 --> 00:22:45.880 align:middle line:84%
that had a spirit,
an energy within it.

00:22:45.880 --> 00:22:48.310 align:middle line:84%
And the more and more and
more and more and more

00:22:48.310 --> 00:22:55.200 align:middle line:84%
it was reduced, that eventually
becomes invisible to us.

00:22:55.200 --> 00:22:56.330 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:22:56.330 --> 00:22:59.180 align:middle line:84%
>>AUSTIN: And then once
something is invisible to us,

00:22:59.180 --> 00:23:00.830 align:middle line:84%
it doesn't mean it's
completely gone.

00:23:00.830 --> 00:23:03.093 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: No,
they've proven that.

00:23:03.093 --> 00:23:04.510 align:middle line:84%
It's carrying all
those properties

00:23:04.510 --> 00:23:06.650 align:middle line:84%
with none of the
physical property there.

00:23:06.650 --> 00:23:08.170 align:middle line:84%
>>AUSTIN: But the
further something

00:23:08.170 --> 00:23:10.250 align:middle line:84%
goes away from
its physical body,

00:23:10.250 --> 00:23:12.590 align:middle line:90%
the more it goes into spirit.

00:23:12.590 --> 00:23:15.640 align:middle line:84%
So the spirit becomes more
and more expansive when

00:23:15.640 --> 00:23:18.790 align:middle line:84%
it leaves the body, which
explains, to me, why homeopathy

00:23:18.790 --> 00:23:21.120 align:middle line:84%
is so potent, the
more diluted it is.

00:23:21.120 --> 00:23:21.920 align:middle line:10%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:23:21.920 --> 00:23:23.790 align:middle line:10%
>>AUSTIN: And I've
done many studies

00:23:23.790 --> 00:23:30.150 align:middle line:10%
on homeopathy, where we're
seeing the original remedy show

00:23:30.150 --> 00:23:33.060 align:middle line:10%
up in the crystallography.

00:23:33.060 --> 00:23:35.370 align:middle line:10%
And I've done very
few, but still some

00:23:35.370 --> 00:23:36.850 align:middle line:10%
repeated tests with that.

00:23:36.850 --> 00:23:38.520 align:middle line:10%
So we can see that
there actually

00:23:38.520 --> 00:23:43.440 align:middle line:10%
is something in there that
is identified by the water

00:23:43.440 --> 00:23:45.305 align:middle line:10%
and crystallized by the water.

00:23:45.305 --> 00:23:46.680 align:middle line:10%
>>REGINA: Well,
one of the things

00:23:46.680 --> 00:23:50.170 align:middle line:10%
I know that you speak
about is in Egypt,

00:23:50.170 --> 00:23:53.340 align:middle line:10%
that one of the healing
practices to write something

00:23:53.340 --> 00:23:57.730 align:middle line:10%
on a papyrus or a stone and
then run the water over it.

00:23:57.730 --> 00:24:00.510 align:middle line:84%
And that water would
become the cure.

00:24:00.510 --> 00:24:02.040 align:middle line:84%
>>AUSTIN: They
called them sigils.

00:24:02.040 --> 00:24:04.830 align:middle line:84%
And they would write
some hieroglyphs

00:24:04.830 --> 00:24:06.520 align:middle line:90%
on papyrus or on a stone.

00:24:06.520 --> 00:24:08.800 align:middle line:84%
And they'd put it into
a container of water,

00:24:08.800 --> 00:24:11.380 align:middle line:84%
and they'd let it stew
there for a while.

00:24:11.380 --> 00:24:14.970 align:middle line:84%
And then what they
did was, basically,

00:24:14.970 --> 00:24:19.350 align:middle line:84%
give it to people as a
medicine or a cure or something

00:24:19.350 --> 00:24:21.400 align:middle line:84%
to put on their
bodies topically,

00:24:21.400 --> 00:24:22.850 align:middle line:90%
if they have sore eyes.

00:24:22.850 --> 00:24:25.060 align:middle line:84%
So they absolutely
believed that water

00:24:25.060 --> 00:24:26.860 align:middle line:84%
was the storehouse
of information

00:24:26.860 --> 00:24:30.260 align:middle line:84%
and could be used
practically like a medicine.

00:24:30.260 --> 00:24:32.570 align:middle line:90%
But even homeopathy does this.

00:24:32.570 --> 00:24:35.360 align:middle line:84%
They will write the remedy
on a piece of paper.

00:24:35.360 --> 00:24:37.930 align:middle line:84%
It's called a paper remedy,
put the water on top

00:24:37.930 --> 00:24:40.900 align:middle line:84%
and offer it as a
remedy, which also works.

00:24:40.900 --> 00:24:43.720 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Well, this is where
we get back to Masaru Emoto's

00:24:43.720 --> 00:24:45.185 align:middle line:90%
original work.

00:24:45.185 --> 00:24:45.320 align:middle line:90%
>>AUSTIN: Yeah.

00:24:45.320 --> 00:24:46.130 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:24:46.130 --> 00:24:50.590 align:middle line:84%
And then, just to give people
an idea of your own lineage

00:24:50.590 --> 00:24:53.200 align:middle line:84%
and where you were
with his work and what

00:24:53.200 --> 00:24:56.770 align:middle line:84%
was in the world at that time
and what sparked you to carry it

00:24:56.770 --> 00:25:00.010 align:middle line:84%
forward and what you started
seeing as much deeper potential

00:25:00.010 --> 00:25:00.992 align:middle line:90%
beyond that.

00:25:00.992 --> 00:25:03.200 align:middle line:84%
Tell us a little bit about
that part of your journey.

00:25:03.200 --> 00:25:05.405 align:middle line:84%
What was the original
stimulation there?

00:25:05.405 --> 00:25:07.960 align:middle line:84%
>>AUSTIN: Well, I had been
in a horrendous car accident.

00:25:07.960 --> 00:25:11.170 align:middle line:10%
And I had had a healing
experience with a very

00:25:11.170 --> 00:25:12.710 align:middle line:10%
special water from New Zealand.

00:25:12.710 --> 00:25:14.260 align:middle line:10%
It was an artisan water.

00:25:14.260 --> 00:25:16.300 align:middle line:10%
And I became curious.

00:25:16.300 --> 00:25:18.250 align:middle line:84%
Well, what makes this
water different than all

00:25:18.250 --> 00:25:20.050 align:middle line:90%
the other waters?

00:25:20.050 --> 00:25:22.840 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Do you mind my asking,
what was the healing experience?

00:25:22.840 --> 00:25:23.640 align:middle line:90%
>>AUSTIN: Sure.

00:25:23.640 --> 00:25:27.690 align:middle line:84%
Well, after that car accident,
I had eight surgeries

00:25:27.690 --> 00:25:31.900 align:middle line:84%
over 20 years, mostly
for bowel surgery,

00:25:31.900 --> 00:25:34.770 align:middle line:84%
because the seat belt had
crushed my internal organs

00:25:34.770 --> 00:25:37.500 align:middle line:84%
and had left scar tissue
on my small bowel, which

00:25:37.500 --> 00:25:40.210 align:middle line:84%
kept growing and cutting
my digestive system off.

00:25:40.210 --> 00:25:44.490 align:middle line:84%
So on my last surgery, I woke
up surrounded by doctors,

00:25:44.490 --> 00:25:47.260 align:middle line:84%
and they said, you
didn't recover very well.

00:25:47.260 --> 00:25:50.718 align:middle line:84%
And now, you have showers of
blood clots in your lungs,

00:25:50.718 --> 00:25:52.510 align:middle line:84%
and you're going to
have to be on warfarin,

00:25:52.510 --> 00:25:54.093 align:middle line:84%
which is a blood
thinner, potentially,

00:25:54.093 --> 00:25:55.500 align:middle line:90%
for the rest of your life.

00:25:55.500 --> 00:25:57.690 align:middle line:90%
And I was like shocked.

00:25:57.690 --> 00:26:00.750 align:middle line:84%
And so for about
three or four months,

00:26:00.750 --> 00:26:03.000 align:middle line:84%
I took warfarin because they
said I was going to die,

00:26:03.000 --> 00:26:04.200 align:middle line:90%
if I didn't.

00:26:04.200 --> 00:26:06.880 align:middle line:84%
And after that time, I
had a clear chest X-ray.

00:26:06.880 --> 00:26:08.770 align:middle line:84%
And I made a
decision for myself.

00:26:08.770 --> 00:26:11.220 align:middle line:84%
It's never advice
to anybody else,

00:26:11.220 --> 00:26:14.430 align:middle line:84%
but I had already seen that,
just because a doctor tells me

00:26:14.430 --> 00:26:16.710 align:middle line:84%
my body can't do something,
doesn't necessarily

00:26:16.710 --> 00:26:17.710 align:middle line:90%
mean it's true.

00:26:17.710 --> 00:26:19.260 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Oh, you have a lot
of people in the audience that

00:26:19.260 --> 00:26:20.110 align:middle line:90%
agree with that.

00:26:20.110 --> 00:26:21.090 align:middle line:90%
>>AUSTIN: Well, I had been--

00:26:21.090 --> 00:26:21.760 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Including me.

00:26:21.760 --> 00:26:22.593 align:middle line:90%
>>AUSTIN: Thank you.

00:26:22.593 --> 00:26:24.580 align:middle line:84%
Well, it's good to know
I'm in good company.

00:26:24.580 --> 00:26:26.392 align:middle line:84%
But I had been told
by three doctors,

00:26:26.392 --> 00:26:27.850 align:middle line:84%
I'd never be able
to have children.

00:26:27.850 --> 00:26:31.260 align:middle line:84%
And I had a child for every
doctor that told me I couldn't.

00:26:31.260 --> 00:26:35.070 align:middle line:84%
Obviously, not out of defiance,
but it was all little miracles.

00:26:35.070 --> 00:26:40.170 align:middle line:84%
So I was able to hear them
say all of these things

00:26:40.170 --> 00:26:42.520 align:middle line:84%
about what my body
could and couldn't do,

00:26:42.520 --> 00:26:46.210 align:middle line:84%
put it on the shelf, and just
let my body make that decision.

00:26:46.210 --> 00:26:47.743 align:middle line:90%
So I did the same thing.

00:26:47.743 --> 00:26:49.660 align:middle line:84%
I went on this healing
journey where I'm like,

00:26:49.660 --> 00:26:53.640 align:middle line:84%
well, I want to be the
best version of myself,

00:26:53.640 --> 00:26:56.370 align:middle line:90%
I can be holistically.

00:26:56.370 --> 00:26:58.950 align:middle line:84%
So I went to a friend of
mine who's a medical doctor,

00:26:58.950 --> 00:27:00.760 align:middle line:84%
but practices
Ayurvedic medicine.

00:27:00.760 --> 00:27:02.850 align:middle line:84%
And he said to me,
well, why don't you

00:27:02.850 --> 00:27:05.230 align:middle line:90%
start with a foundation of life?

00:27:05.230 --> 00:27:08.970 align:middle line:84%
And he said, if you can find
a natural source, emphasis

00:27:08.970 --> 00:27:12.030 align:middle line:84%
on natural, of
alkaline water, that

00:27:12.030 --> 00:27:15.690 align:middle line:84%
might help to bring your body
back into some kind of balance.

00:27:15.690 --> 00:27:16.820 align:middle line:90%
And I loved that.

00:27:16.820 --> 00:27:19.400 align:middle line:84%
I was like, oh, this is
simple, just drink water.

00:27:19.400 --> 00:27:21.250 align:middle line:84%
In New Zealand, we
have so many springs.

00:27:21.250 --> 00:27:23.930 align:middle line:84%
And most spring water
is naturally alkaline.

00:27:23.930 --> 00:27:26.170 align:middle line:90%
Anything above a seven of pH.

00:27:26.170 --> 00:27:29.480 align:middle line:84%
Seven is what you might
call distilled water.

00:27:29.480 --> 00:27:32.920 align:middle line:84%
And anything under a seven
is what we would call acidic.

00:27:32.920 --> 00:27:36.250 align:middle line:84%
And so I started trialing
myself on two-week trials

00:27:36.250 --> 00:27:39.190 align:middle line:84%
with different naturally
alkaline waters.

00:27:39.190 --> 00:27:43.060 align:middle line:84%
I had a healing wellness
center at that time.

00:27:43.060 --> 00:27:46.540 align:middle line:84%
And a client said, look,
I know this old guy's

00:27:46.540 --> 00:27:49.160 align:middle line:84%
got his own private
source of alkaline water.

00:27:49.160 --> 00:27:51.530 align:middle line:84%
It's 9.9 out of
the ground in pH,

00:27:51.530 --> 00:27:53.660 align:middle line:84%
which is an incredibly
naturally alkaline.

00:27:53.660 --> 00:27:56.930 align:middle line:84%
And he was only giving
it to cancer patients.

00:27:56.930 --> 00:27:58.768 align:middle line:90%
She said, you might get some.

00:27:58.768 --> 00:28:00.560 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And were they
benefiting from it?

00:28:00.560 --> 00:28:02.518 align:middle line:84%
>>AUSTIN: They were having
amazing experiences.

00:28:02.518 --> 00:28:05.500 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: It makes sense
because cancer really enjoys

00:28:05.500 --> 00:28:07.230 align:middle line:90%
acid and acidic environment.

00:28:07.230 --> 00:28:08.030 align:middle line:90%
>>AUSTIN: Yeah.

00:28:08.030 --> 00:28:09.077 align:middle line:90%
So I went to see him.

00:28:09.077 --> 00:28:09.910 align:middle line:90%
I told him my story.

00:28:09.910 --> 00:28:12.730 align:middle line:84%
And he gave me a month's
worth of water to drink.

00:28:12.730 --> 00:28:17.310 align:middle line:84%
Day three, I noticed something
that so many people in the West

00:28:17.310 --> 00:28:19.930 align:middle line:84%
don't like talking about,
and that is bowel motions.

00:28:19.930 --> 00:28:20.730 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:28:20.730 --> 00:28:21.660 align:middle line:90%
It's OK.

00:28:21.660 --> 00:28:22.930 align:middle line:90%
You're safe.

00:28:22.930 --> 00:28:23.755 align:middle line:90%
We all have them.

00:28:23.755 --> 00:28:24.880 align:middle line:90%
>>AUSTIN: We all have them.

00:28:24.880 --> 00:28:27.265 align:middle line:84%
And they're such an indicator
of our internal health.

00:28:27.265 --> 00:28:28.140 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Absolutely.

00:28:28.140 --> 00:28:31.335 align:middle line:84%
>>AUSTIN: Especially after
having so much bowel surgery.

00:28:31.335 --> 00:28:33.960 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: I can't even imagine
the amount of pain and suffering

00:28:33.960 --> 00:28:34.870 align:middle line:90%
you went through.

00:28:34.870 --> 00:28:35.703 align:middle line:90%
>>AUSTIN: Thank you.

00:28:35.703 --> 00:28:36.530 align:middle line:90%
It was rough.

00:28:36.530 --> 00:28:37.650 align:middle line:90%
Yeah, it was rough.

00:28:37.650 --> 00:28:40.380 align:middle line:84%
But it makes me so
grateful every day

00:28:40.380 --> 00:28:41.670 align:middle line:90%
to be able to eat food.

00:28:41.670 --> 00:28:42.060 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Just eat food.

00:28:42.060 --> 00:28:43.352 align:middle line:90%
>>AUSTIN: And drink good water.

00:28:43.352 --> 00:28:44.152 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:28:44.152 --> 00:28:46.190 align:middle line:84%
>>AUSTIN: So I'm like,
oh, something's changing.

00:28:46.190 --> 00:28:46.990 align:middle line:90%
This is good.

00:28:46.990 --> 00:28:51.450 align:middle line:84%
And then on day 10, I noticed
the most radical change.

00:28:51.450 --> 00:28:54.480 align:middle line:84%
I had all these bumps
coming up on my arm and jaw

00:28:54.480 --> 00:28:57.420 align:middle line:84%
on my right side that
were really painful.

00:28:57.420 --> 00:28:59.380 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: While you were
drinking this water?

00:28:59.380 --> 00:29:01.660 align:middle line:84%
>>AUSTIN: Yes, whilst I was
only drinking this water.

00:29:01.660 --> 00:29:04.020 align:middle line:90%
This was my trial water.

00:29:04.020 --> 00:29:08.800 align:middle line:84%
And what was amazing is that, as
disgusting as this might sound,

00:29:08.800 --> 00:29:10.930 align:middle line:84%
there was a bump
that was so angry,

00:29:10.930 --> 00:29:12.590 align:middle line:84%
and it literally felt like there
was something sharp in sharpen

00:29:12.590 --> 00:29:13.390 align:middle line:90%
there.

00:29:13.390 --> 00:29:16.790 align:middle line:84%
So I got some tweezers, and I
pulled this thing out of my arm.

00:29:16.790 --> 00:29:19.200 align:middle line:84%
And it was a little
shard of green glass.

00:29:19.200 --> 00:29:22.910 align:middle line:84%
And between day 10 and 12, I
picked 27 pieces of green glass

00:29:22.910 --> 00:29:26.750 align:middle line:84%
out of my arm that had been
embedded in my body for over 20

00:29:26.750 --> 00:29:29.640 align:middle line:84%
years because the man who
died in the car accident,

00:29:29.640 --> 00:29:31.260 align:middle line:90%
he had owned a nightclub.

00:29:31.260 --> 00:29:34.590 align:middle line:84%
And in the back of the car
were crates of Steinlager beer,

00:29:34.590 --> 00:29:38.640 align:middle line:84%
which is a lager that's
held in green glass bottles.

00:29:38.640 --> 00:29:39.780 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Oh, my gosh.

00:29:39.780 --> 00:29:42.930 align:middle line:84%
>>AUSTIN: So I immediately
was like, well--

00:29:42.930 --> 00:29:45.690 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Your body was
rejecting these foreign objects.

00:29:45.690 --> 00:29:47.250 align:middle line:84%
>>AUSTIN: And how
was this possible?

00:29:47.250 --> 00:29:48.050 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:29:48.050 --> 00:29:52.830 align:middle line:84%
>>AUSTIN: So then I thought,
well, could it be just me?

00:29:52.830 --> 00:29:56.600 align:middle line:84%
So I started trialing people
in the wellness center.

00:29:56.600 --> 00:29:59.120 align:middle line:84%
Interestingly,
every single person

00:29:59.120 --> 00:30:01.950 align:middle line:84%
who came to that wellness
center and tried the water,

00:30:01.950 --> 00:30:03.120 align:middle line:90%
their eyesight improved.

00:30:03.120 --> 00:30:07.010 align:middle line:84%
One lady had to literally change
the prescription on her glasses

00:30:07.010 --> 00:30:09.060 align:middle line:90%
because it improved so much.

00:30:09.060 --> 00:30:14.770 align:middle line:84%
Our eye lens is 99% highly
ordered structured water, which

00:30:14.770 --> 00:30:17.260 align:middle line:90%
is in the fourth phase state.

00:30:17.260 --> 00:30:21.920 align:middle line:84%
And so it was amazing to
me to see this change,

00:30:21.920 --> 00:30:25.810 align:middle line:84%
but there were so many, from
increased energy for very

00:30:25.810 --> 00:30:29.830 align:middle line:84%
healthy, well, people, all the
way to someone who did a 27-day

00:30:29.830 --> 00:30:33.530 align:middle line:84%
water fast drinking this
water alone, no food.

00:30:33.530 --> 00:30:36.800 align:middle line:84%
He did this because he was
told he had stage IV cancer.

00:30:36.800 --> 00:30:40.510 align:middle line:84%
And he wanted to try to do
a fast before he went down

00:30:40.510 --> 00:30:42.490 align:middle line:90%
the chemotherapy track.

00:30:42.490 --> 00:30:45.250 align:middle line:84%
Halfway through this
fast, they could

00:30:45.250 --> 00:30:47.870 align:middle line:84%
see that his tumor
was reduced by half.

00:30:47.870 --> 00:30:53.440 align:middle line:84%
Three weeks after the fast, they
found that there was no cancer.

00:30:53.440 --> 00:30:55.700 align:middle line:84%
And they called it
spontaneous healing.

00:30:55.700 --> 00:30:58.760 align:middle line:84%
There were two other
people that did water fast,

00:30:58.760 --> 00:31:02.410 align:middle line:84%
not as long that saw
reduction of tumors.

00:31:02.410 --> 00:31:04.430 align:middle line:90%
Now, this was an observation.

00:31:04.430 --> 00:31:05.622 align:middle line:90%
I'm not saying that it was--

00:31:05.622 --> 00:31:06.580 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: I understand.

00:31:06.580 --> 00:31:08.720 align:middle line:84%
What happened to your
own body in the end?

00:31:08.720 --> 00:31:11.080 align:middle line:84%
>>AUSTIN: For me, I
actually started--

00:31:11.080 --> 00:31:12.160 align:middle line:90%
there were many benefits.

00:31:12.160 --> 00:31:12.960 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:31:12.960 --> 00:31:15.550 align:middle line:84%
>>AUSTIN: I had more
energy, which was a big one.

00:31:15.550 --> 00:31:18.160 align:middle line:84%
My water went through
a real cleanse.

00:31:18.160 --> 00:31:21.180 align:middle line:84%
My body went through
a real cleanse.

00:31:21.180 --> 00:31:23.920 align:middle line:90%
My hair texture improved.

00:31:23.920 --> 00:31:25.300 align:middle line:90%
My skin texture improved.

00:31:25.300 --> 00:31:27.190 align:middle line:84%
Literally, it was like
the fountain of youth.

00:31:27.190 --> 00:31:29.580 align:middle line:84%
People started saying,
oh, have you had

00:31:29.580 --> 00:31:31.103 align:middle line:90%
something done to your face?

00:31:31.103 --> 00:31:32.020 align:middle line:90%
You look much younger.

00:31:32.020 --> 00:31:34.440 align:middle line:84%
And I'm like, I've just been
drinking this amazing water.

00:31:34.440 --> 00:31:42.510 align:middle line:84%
And so I started to get really
immersed in this idea of,

00:31:42.510 --> 00:31:44.230 align:middle line:90%
what makes this water different?

00:31:44.230 --> 00:31:47.280 align:middle line:84%
So very technically, of
course, I went to an analysis.

00:31:47.280 --> 00:31:48.990 align:middle line:90%
What's in the water?

00:31:48.990 --> 00:31:52.210 align:middle line:84%
And there's bicarb,
there is silica,

00:31:52.210 --> 00:31:54.550 align:middle line:84%
there's lots of different
dissolved minerals.

00:31:54.550 --> 00:31:55.560 align:middle line:90%
There's lime.

00:31:55.560 --> 00:31:57.330 align:middle line:84%
Now, bicarb and
lime are the reasons

00:31:57.330 --> 00:31:59.590 align:middle line:84%
that it's become
naturally alkaline.

00:31:59.590 --> 00:32:01.935 align:middle line:84%
If you want to make
water naturally alkaline

00:32:01.935 --> 00:32:03.310 align:middle line:84%
and you've got
some acidic water,

00:32:03.310 --> 00:32:06.580 align:middle line:84%
you just put a little pinch
of bicarb or baking soda.

00:32:06.580 --> 00:32:07.380 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:32:07.380 --> 00:32:07.950 align:middle line:90%
Baking soda.

00:32:07.950 --> 00:32:08.783 align:middle line:90%
>>AUSTIN: And water.

00:32:08.783 --> 00:32:10.880 align:middle line:84%
Bring it up to
about an 8.2 in pH.

00:32:10.880 --> 00:32:13.910 align:middle line:84%
But as I'm looking through
this analysis, I'm thinking,

00:32:13.910 --> 00:32:17.360 align:middle line:84%
all this is telling me
is what water holds,

00:32:17.360 --> 00:32:20.550 align:middle line:84%
but it's not telling
me of what water is.

00:32:20.550 --> 00:32:21.350 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:32:21.350 --> 00:32:22.150 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:32:22.150 --> 00:32:25.590 align:middle line:10%
So before we go to that, and
we go to you and Pam Gregory,

00:32:25.590 --> 00:32:30.030 align:middle line:10%
your work together,
my question is,

00:32:30.030 --> 00:32:33.210 align:middle line:10%
you had this beautiful,
natural 9.9 water.

00:32:33.210 --> 00:32:36.590 align:middle line:84%
So what happens when you go to a
machine that basically pumps it

00:32:36.590 --> 00:32:39.650 align:middle line:90%
up to 9 plus?

00:32:39.650 --> 00:32:40.800 align:middle line:90%
>>AUSTIN: Well--

00:32:40.800 --> 00:32:43.880 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: What is the
machine intervention do?

00:32:43.880 --> 00:32:47.660 align:middle line:84%
>>AUSTIN: Well, this is ionizing
machines you're talking about.

00:32:47.660 --> 00:32:52.190 align:middle line:84%
And they artificially make two
streams, one alkaline stream

00:32:52.190 --> 00:32:54.080 align:middle line:90%
and one acidic stream.

00:32:54.080 --> 00:32:59.480 align:middle line:84%
And the only benefit
that I see from them

00:32:59.480 --> 00:33:03.020 align:middle line:84%
is that it makes
molecular hydrogen.

00:33:03.020 --> 00:33:06.200 align:middle line:84%
I don't believe that
it is the pH that's

00:33:06.200 --> 00:33:09.570 align:middle line:84%
making the difference in
those ionizing machines.

00:33:09.570 --> 00:33:15.330 align:middle line:84%
Personally, I would far prefer
to get molecular hydrogen

00:33:15.330 --> 00:33:19.030 align:middle line:84%
in a different form,
whether it's in a pill form,

00:33:19.030 --> 00:33:22.800 align:middle line:84%
you can get it and put it into
water or very different ways

00:33:22.800 --> 00:33:25.570 align:middle line:90%
that you can inhale it.

00:33:25.570 --> 00:33:28.418 align:middle line:84%
There's various ways you
can get molecular hydrogen.

00:33:28.418 --> 00:33:30.460 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: What about
Patrick Flanagan's old work?

00:33:30.460 --> 00:33:35.330 align:middle line:84%
Patrick Flanagan's Mega H, H
minus, whatever it was called.

00:33:35.330 --> 00:33:37.080 align:middle line:84%
>>AUSTIN: Whichever
way you want to do it.

00:33:37.080 --> 00:33:37.570 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: You could do it.

00:33:37.570 --> 00:33:38.800 align:middle line:90%
So that's one way to do it.

00:33:38.800 --> 00:33:40.550 align:middle line:84%
>>AUSTIN: Whichever
way you want to do it,

00:33:40.550 --> 00:33:43.450 align:middle line:84%
but I prefer to go and get a
natural source of spring water,

00:33:43.450 --> 00:33:47.070 align:middle line:84%
if you can collect it yourself
or get it the best you can

00:33:47.070 --> 00:33:49.740 align:middle line:90%
and add the hydrogen to it.

00:33:49.740 --> 00:33:53.700 align:middle line:84%
That way, what I found is the
ionizing machines de-structure

00:33:53.700 --> 00:33:54.543 align:middle line:90%
the water.

00:33:54.543 --> 00:33:55.960 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: That's
why I was asking.

00:33:55.960 --> 00:33:58.440 align:middle line:84%
>>AUSTIN: So it has
less information.

00:33:58.440 --> 00:34:00.900 align:middle line:84%
Actually, there are
many different things

00:34:00.900 --> 00:34:04.600 align:middle line:84%
with it is that often, it
doesn't filter everything out,

00:34:04.600 --> 00:34:09.330 align:middle line:84%
so it doesn't filter any
chlorine or fluoride,

00:34:09.330 --> 00:34:10.560 align:middle line:90%
these kinds of things.

00:34:10.560 --> 00:34:15.889 align:middle line:84%
And it also is very detrimental
to the natural structure

00:34:15.889 --> 00:34:17.210 align:middle line:90%
of the water.

00:34:17.210 --> 00:34:21.679 align:middle line:84%
So I would personally
prefer to go

00:34:21.679 --> 00:34:26.030 align:middle line:84%
with a naturally alkaline
water, which is stable.

00:34:26.030 --> 00:34:28.563 align:middle line:84%
So the stability
is because there

00:34:28.563 --> 00:34:30.230 align:middle line:84%
are all of the minerals
that are already

00:34:30.230 --> 00:34:33.050 align:middle line:84%
in the water that have
been collected over however

00:34:33.050 --> 00:34:35.420 align:middle line:84%
long that water has been
going through the Earth,

00:34:35.420 --> 00:34:36.929 align:middle line:90%
and it is stable.

00:34:36.929 --> 00:34:39.980 align:middle line:84%
What I mean by that
is if you took the pH

00:34:39.980 --> 00:34:44.760 align:middle line:84%
level of the naturally
alkaline water, a year later,

00:34:44.760 --> 00:34:47.780 align:middle line:84%
you will find it's
barely made any change.

00:34:47.780 --> 00:34:52.440 align:middle line:84%
Whereas, an unnaturally alkaline
water or an ionized water,

00:34:52.440 --> 00:34:57.650 align:middle line:84%
that pH starts to drop
within 20, 30 minutes.

00:34:57.650 --> 00:35:02.720 align:middle line:84%
And so when you are looking at
water that is designed naturally

00:35:02.720 --> 00:35:08.360 align:middle line:84%
by nature over long periods of
time, the stability is amazing.

00:35:08.360 --> 00:35:10.960 align:middle line:84%
And what I also am
always surprised

00:35:10.960 --> 00:35:13.300 align:middle line:84%
about with this kind of
trend we have, thankfully,

00:35:13.300 --> 00:35:18.040 align:middle line:84%
to non-GMO, to organic,
to growing food

00:35:18.040 --> 00:35:20.800 align:middle line:84%
yourself, to wild
harvesting, and all

00:35:20.800 --> 00:35:22.610 align:middle line:90%
of these wonderful practices.

00:35:22.610 --> 00:35:25.360 align:middle line:84%
Why would we go to
a machine made water

00:35:25.360 --> 00:35:29.290 align:middle line:84%
when we could go and collect
wild spring water ourselves,

00:35:29.290 --> 00:35:30.265 align:middle line:90%
if we are able?

00:35:30.265 --> 00:35:33.370 align:middle line:90%


00:35:33.370 --> 00:35:34.760 align:middle line:90%
If I had no choice.

00:35:34.760 --> 00:35:37.870 align:middle line:84%
I would rather
drink water that's

00:35:37.870 --> 00:35:40.570 align:middle line:84%
gone through a
really good filter

00:35:40.570 --> 00:35:45.110 align:middle line:84%
than have it go through
a whole ionizing process.

00:35:45.110 --> 00:35:47.950 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: That's good to know,
because you study and you watch

00:35:47.950 --> 00:35:49.550 align:middle line:90%
water, and it watches you.

00:35:49.550 --> 00:35:52.320 align:middle line:84%
And so you're working together
to share this information

00:35:52.320 --> 00:35:53.120 align:middle line:90%
with us.

00:35:53.120 --> 00:35:55.162 align:middle line:84%
And that's very practical
because a lot of people

00:35:55.162 --> 00:35:56.780 align:middle line:84%
do this, a lot of
people watching.

00:35:56.780 --> 00:35:58.670 align:middle line:84%
So I'm happy you
could share that.

00:35:58.670 --> 00:36:02.080 align:middle line:84%
>>AUSTIN: I would
say one other thing.

00:36:02.080 --> 00:36:05.140 align:middle line:84%
It's an unpopular thing
that I say sometimes.

00:36:05.140 --> 00:36:05.940 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: It's OK.

00:36:05.940 --> 00:36:07.315 align:middle line:84%
>>AUSTIN: Because
many people are

00:36:07.315 --> 00:36:10.990 align:middle line:84%
attached to the very expensive
equipment that they've bought.

00:36:10.990 --> 00:36:13.450 align:middle line:84%
But when it comes
to water structure,

00:36:13.450 --> 00:36:19.950 align:middle line:84%
I can honestly say that the most
significant structural change

00:36:19.950 --> 00:36:22.530 align:middle line:84%
that I have ever seen
and consistently see

00:36:22.530 --> 00:36:25.140 align:middle line:84%
is through conscious
expression, not

00:36:25.140 --> 00:36:27.980 align:middle line:84%
through any of the other
water restructuring machines

00:36:27.980 --> 00:36:28.780 align:middle line:90%
that I've seen.

00:36:28.780 --> 00:36:33.240 align:middle line:84%
Not to say that they some
don't work, and many do work,

00:36:33.240 --> 00:36:38.160 align:middle line:84%
but the conscious expression
affects water far more

00:36:38.160 --> 00:36:41.230 align:middle line:84%
than any mechanical
or man-made thing.

00:36:41.230 --> 00:36:45.510 align:middle line:84%
Because water, essentially,
is reading your information.

00:36:45.510 --> 00:36:46.660 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Consciousness.

00:36:46.660 --> 00:36:49.420 align:middle line:84%
>>AUSTIN: And we are bodies
of water, salts, minerals,

00:36:49.420 --> 00:36:50.620 align:middle line:90%
and consciousness.

00:36:50.620 --> 00:36:55.900 align:middle line:84%
So it is, essentially, having
conversations with ourselves,

00:36:55.900 --> 00:36:58.530 align:middle line:84%
not just the mental
ones, because it

00:36:58.530 --> 00:37:02.540 align:middle line:84%
will override what I'm thinking
to show me how I'm feeling.

00:37:02.540 --> 00:37:05.450 align:middle line:84%
If I'm putting flowers
in water and waiting

00:37:05.450 --> 00:37:08.330 align:middle line:84%
to see whether it shows the
flower, but I'm genuinely sad,

00:37:08.330 --> 00:37:09.570 align:middle line:90%
it won't show me the flower.

00:37:09.570 --> 00:37:10.780 align:middle line:90%
It'll show me a sad face.

00:37:10.780 --> 00:37:12.030 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: This is interesting.

00:37:12.030 --> 00:37:13.200 align:middle line:90%
It's just fascinating.

00:37:13.200 --> 00:37:16.200 align:middle line:84%
And the images in your book,
some of which we've seen here,

00:37:16.200 --> 00:37:20.595 align:middle line:84%
are just mystical, magical
and mystical in nature.

00:37:20.595 --> 00:37:21.970 align:middle line:84%
>>AUSTIN: I'm glad
you said that.

00:37:21.970 --> 00:37:23.880 align:middle line:84%
I was talking to
someone yesterday.

00:37:23.880 --> 00:37:25.110 align:middle line:90%
I'd never heard this before.

00:37:25.110 --> 00:37:27.330 align:middle line:84%
He said, you know how
water is a mystery.

00:37:27.330 --> 00:37:28.410 align:middle line:90%
And I said, yes.

00:37:28.410 --> 00:37:32.060 align:middle line:84%
He said, you know
it's mist story.

00:37:32.060 --> 00:37:34.440 align:middle line:84%
I'm like, oh, it's
the story of mist.

00:37:34.440 --> 00:37:35.965 align:middle line:90%
I love that.

00:37:35.965 --> 00:37:36.840 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Well, good.

00:37:36.840 --> 00:37:38.520 align:middle line:90%
I'm glad you brought it up.

00:37:38.520 --> 00:37:41.180 align:middle line:84%
So what I want to finally
get on to our final topic

00:37:41.180 --> 00:37:43.710 align:middle line:84%
is going to be the work you
and Pamela Gregory have done.

00:37:43.710 --> 00:37:47.010 align:middle line:84%
A lot of people know
Pamela Gregory online.

00:37:47.010 --> 00:37:50.020 align:middle line:84%
She's an astrologer, but she
also gets into some other things

00:37:50.020 --> 00:37:50.820 align:middle line:90%
as well.

00:37:50.820 --> 00:37:53.930 align:middle line:84%
And you two are
working on the notion

00:37:53.930 --> 00:37:56.570 align:middle line:84%
of the cosmic effect
of the planets

00:37:56.570 --> 00:37:59.660 align:middle line:90%
on water and vice-versa or what?

00:37:59.660 --> 00:38:02.560 align:middle line:84%
Again, I believe
we're absolutely

00:38:02.560 --> 00:38:05.230 align:middle line:84%
our waters are a storehouse
for that physically

00:38:05.230 --> 00:38:06.590 align:middle line:90%
and the Earth itself.

00:38:06.590 --> 00:38:07.700 align:middle line:90%
What are you two doing?

00:38:07.700 --> 00:38:08.350 align:middle line:90%
What are you cooking up?

00:38:08.350 --> 00:38:09.433 align:middle line:90%
And what have you learned?

00:38:09.433 --> 00:38:11.143 align:middle line:84%
And we have about
eight minutes left.

00:38:11.143 --> 00:38:12.560 align:middle line:84%
>>AUSTIN: I will
share it quickly.

00:38:12.560 --> 00:38:14.360 align:middle line:90%
Well, Pam is incredible.

00:38:14.360 --> 00:38:16.720 align:middle line:90%
And she approached me.

00:38:16.720 --> 00:38:20.420 align:middle line:84%
And she said, I'm looking for
the physical proof of astrology.

00:38:20.420 --> 00:38:22.630 align:middle line:84%
And I said, well, why
don't we get together?

00:38:22.630 --> 00:38:25.270 align:middle line:84%
You tell me all the
dates to put water out,

00:38:25.270 --> 00:38:27.040 align:middle line:90%
and we'll see what happens.

00:38:27.040 --> 00:38:29.440 align:middle line:84%
So actually, what
I ended up doing

00:38:29.440 --> 00:38:32.000 align:middle line:90%
was putting a consistent water.

00:38:32.000 --> 00:38:33.860 align:middle line:90%
So I used rain water from home.

00:38:33.860 --> 00:38:36.640 align:middle line:84%
And when I travel, I bring
that rain water with me.

00:38:36.640 --> 00:38:39.020 align:middle line:84%
Rain water has a very
specific pattern.

00:38:39.020 --> 00:38:40.790 align:middle line:90%
It always shows.

00:38:40.790 --> 00:38:43.930 align:middle line:84%
So I'm using rain
water as my control.

00:38:43.930 --> 00:38:48.160 align:middle line:84%
So what we have discovered is
that we see the same pattern

00:38:48.160 --> 00:38:51.400 align:middle line:84%
all the way through until we
get just before a full moon.

00:38:51.400 --> 00:38:53.470 align:middle line:10%
And just before a
full moon, there

00:38:53.470 --> 00:38:56.240 align:middle line:10%
is this opening up in
the crystallography,

00:38:56.240 --> 00:38:58.920 align:middle line:10%
which looks like something's
about to be birthed.

00:38:58.920 --> 00:39:03.820 align:middle line:84%
And then on the full moon,
we see a large oval shape,

00:39:03.820 --> 00:39:06.450 align:middle line:84%
which looks completely different
than the fanning patterns we

00:39:06.450 --> 00:39:08.610 align:middle line:90%
normally see in rain.

00:39:08.610 --> 00:39:12.610 align:middle line:84%
And then a day later, it goes
back to the regular patterns.

00:39:12.610 --> 00:39:16.800 align:middle line:84%
Then when it comes to a new
moon, we see change again.

00:39:16.800 --> 00:39:18.900 align:middle line:84%
And what we see is
that the new moon

00:39:18.900 --> 00:39:24.490 align:middle line:84%
shows two circles that touch
and one circle away from it.

00:39:24.490 --> 00:39:27.100 align:middle line:90%
They are two hydroglyphs.

00:39:27.100 --> 00:39:30.750 align:middle line:84%
One with the energetic
meaning of completion.

00:39:30.750 --> 00:39:33.180 align:middle line:84%
And the two circles
touching, they

00:39:33.180 --> 00:39:36.130 align:middle line:84%
have the energetic
meaning of conception.

00:39:36.130 --> 00:39:40.830 align:middle line:90%
So it is complete conception.

00:39:40.830 --> 00:39:44.610 align:middle line:84%
And what's interesting with
that is that every new moon,

00:39:44.610 --> 00:39:46.770 align:middle line:90%
we see the same symbols show.

00:39:46.770 --> 00:39:51.580 align:middle line:10%
At every ancient site
I have ever gone to,

00:39:51.580 --> 00:39:54.030 align:middle line:10%
done crystallography with
water that I've either

00:39:54.030 --> 00:39:56.480 align:middle line:10%
collected from
that area, or I've

00:39:56.480 --> 00:40:00.380 align:middle line:10%
put the water on top of a
picture of that sacred site,

00:40:00.380 --> 00:40:05.090 align:middle line:10%
I always see complete
conception show up.

00:40:05.090 --> 00:40:09.140 align:middle line:84%
So there is a link there,
which is important for us

00:40:09.140 --> 00:40:10.350 align:middle line:90%
to recognize.

00:40:10.350 --> 00:40:12.530 align:middle line:84%
But one of the most
extraordinary things, because I

00:40:12.530 --> 00:40:15.900 align:middle line:84%
was in Texas during
the solar eclipse,

00:40:15.900 --> 00:40:17.720 align:middle line:84%
and I was able to do
some crystallography.

00:40:17.720 --> 00:40:21.000 align:middle line:84%
And water behaved in a way that
I never imagined it could do.

00:40:21.000 --> 00:40:25.310 align:middle line:84%
If you imagine a snail
trail, and that snail

00:40:25.310 --> 00:40:28.610 align:middle line:84%
is moved all the way, wiggled
around all over the place

00:40:28.610 --> 00:40:35.990 align:middle line:84%
and left this incredible moving
trail, the ice looked like that.

00:40:35.990 --> 00:40:39.560 align:middle line:84%
And when Pam and I discussed
that, the thing that resonated

00:40:39.560 --> 00:40:44.220 align:middle line:84%
for both of us, was it reminded
us of the Aboriginal walkabout

00:40:44.220 --> 00:40:46.800 align:middle line:84%
walking along the song
lines of the earth,

00:40:46.800 --> 00:40:49.220 align:middle line:84%
never in a straight
line, always moving

00:40:49.220 --> 00:40:51.110 align:middle line:90%
in all these wiggly forms.

00:40:51.110 --> 00:40:54.080 align:middle line:84%
Now, I've also done
our crystallography

00:40:54.080 --> 00:40:58.360 align:middle line:84%
when water has been
exposed to lunar eclipses.

00:40:58.360 --> 00:41:00.620 align:middle line:84%
And we see that it
looks plasmatic.

00:41:00.620 --> 00:41:06.220 align:middle line:84%
It looks like it's
in between a liquid.

00:41:06.220 --> 00:41:09.130 align:middle line:84%
It's quite a weird thing to
see because the ice looks

00:41:09.130 --> 00:41:10.820 align:middle line:90%
like it's liquid, but it's not.

00:41:10.820 --> 00:41:12.560 align:middle line:90%
And it looks like plasma.

00:41:12.560 --> 00:41:15.230 align:middle line:84%
Now, when I've asked water
if it could see spirit,

00:41:15.230 --> 00:41:19.070 align:middle line:84%
it showed me the same kind of
designs, but of people's faces.

00:41:19.070 --> 00:41:22.730 align:middle line:84%
But in this watery,
unusual texture.

00:41:22.730 --> 00:41:25.430 align:middle line:90%
So it texturally changed.

00:41:25.430 --> 00:41:27.890 align:middle line:84%
And when it came
to the solstice,

00:41:27.890 --> 00:41:30.520 align:middle line:84%
water looked like there
were all kinds of seeds

00:41:30.520 --> 00:41:35.050 align:middle line:84%
everywhere, completely different
than the regular patterns

00:41:35.050 --> 00:41:37.120 align:middle line:90%
of rain.

00:41:37.120 --> 00:41:40.060 align:middle line:84%
I've been working alongside
a scientist that's

00:41:40.060 --> 00:41:45.550 align:middle line:84%
been able to prove even that
the surface tension of water

00:41:45.550 --> 00:41:47.783 align:middle line:90%
changes during an eclipse.

00:41:47.783 --> 00:41:48.700 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Interesting.

00:41:48.700 --> 00:41:50.378 align:middle line:90%
>>AUSTIN: Yeah.

00:41:50.378 --> 00:41:52.170 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: What's that
do to the human body,

00:41:52.170 --> 00:41:53.470 align:middle line:90%
since we're made of water?

00:41:53.470 --> 00:41:56.250 align:middle line:84%
>>AUSTIN: Well, that's one
of the reasons why I do tests

00:41:56.250 --> 00:41:58.450 align:middle line:90%
both inside and outside.

00:41:58.450 --> 00:42:01.170 align:middle line:84%
I have them both going at
the same time, because I

00:42:01.170 --> 00:42:02.670 align:middle line:90%
was curious about that.

00:42:02.670 --> 00:42:04.613 align:middle line:84%
And what I see is
they both change.

00:42:04.613 --> 00:42:07.230 align:middle line:90%


00:42:07.230 --> 00:42:09.580 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: If the surface
tension of water changes,

00:42:09.580 --> 00:42:11.550 align:middle line:84%
what does that allow
as a possibility

00:42:11.550 --> 00:42:13.513 align:middle line:90%
at those moments in our body?

00:42:13.513 --> 00:42:15.180 align:middle line:84%
>>AUSTIN: What I think
it is an opening.

00:42:15.180 --> 00:42:16.510 align:middle line:90%
It's like an open portal.

00:42:16.510 --> 00:42:16.817 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:42:16.817 --> 00:42:18.970 align:middle line:84%
It seems like you could
take in more information.

00:42:18.970 --> 00:42:19.140 align:middle line:90%
>>AUSTIN: Yeah.

00:42:19.140 --> 00:42:19.810 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:42:19.810 --> 00:42:20.935 align:middle line:90%
>>AUSTIN: Yeah, absolutely.

00:42:20.935 --> 00:42:22.120 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Interesting.

00:42:22.120 --> 00:42:26.890 align:middle line:84%
So one final thing, we
were talking off camera.

00:42:26.890 --> 00:42:30.370 align:middle line:84%
I said, is there any kind of
image that keeps coming up?

00:42:30.370 --> 00:42:34.690 align:middle line:84%
And you were talking about this
image that has come up now,

00:42:34.690 --> 00:42:36.450 align:middle line:90%
how many times?

00:42:36.450 --> 00:42:37.640 align:middle line:90%
>>AUSTIN: 12?

00:42:37.640 --> 00:42:38.440 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: 12 times.

00:42:38.440 --> 00:42:40.590 align:middle line:84%
Let's talk about that
image, what it looks like,

00:42:40.590 --> 00:42:42.880 align:middle line:84%
and what you feel
that might mean.

00:42:42.880 --> 00:42:47.640 align:middle line:10%
>>AUSTIN: Well, I was fortunate
enough to be given melted ice

00:42:47.640 --> 00:42:51.250 align:middle line:10%
core water from Antarctica
that was 10,000 years old,

00:42:51.250 --> 00:42:54.770 align:middle line:10%
and I saw consistent imagery.

00:42:54.770 --> 00:42:59.450 align:middle line:10%
And the image is a circle
with a line underneath it,

00:42:59.450 --> 00:43:04.960 align:middle line:10%
and regularly beside it, there
will be a maple-shaped leaf

00:43:04.960 --> 00:43:07.700 align:middle line:10%
with a long leaf coming upward.

00:43:07.700 --> 00:43:10.630 align:middle line:84%
Now, that longleaf
one, I know already

00:43:10.630 --> 00:43:13.160 align:middle line:84%
is a hydroglyph, which
means to rise up.

00:43:13.160 --> 00:43:16.360 align:middle line:84%
The other two, I was
investigating further.

00:43:16.360 --> 00:43:19.240 align:middle line:84%
The circle, I already
know that itself

00:43:19.240 --> 00:43:21.290 align:middle line:90%
means complete or completion.

00:43:21.290 --> 00:43:24.340 align:middle line:84%
But hydroglyphs
are symbols which

00:43:24.340 --> 00:43:26.740 align:middle line:84%
have multiple layers
of meaning, so they

00:43:26.740 --> 00:43:28.250 align:middle line:90%
have more than one meaning.

00:43:28.250 --> 00:43:31.360 align:middle line:84%
So I was thinking, I feel
like there's probably

00:43:31.360 --> 00:43:32.840 align:middle line:90%
another meaning here.

00:43:32.840 --> 00:43:37.240 align:middle line:84%
And so I was like, I've been
looking for the hieroglyph

00:43:37.240 --> 00:43:38.120 align:middle line:90%
for two words.

00:43:38.120 --> 00:43:39.550 align:middle line:90%
One is children.

00:43:39.550 --> 00:43:41.998 align:middle line:84%
And one is father, because
I already have mother.

00:43:41.998 --> 00:43:43.040 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: What is mother?

00:43:43.040 --> 00:43:45.170 align:middle line:84%
>>AUSTIN: Mother is what
we call the speckle.

00:43:45.170 --> 00:43:47.800 align:middle line:90%
And it also means earth.

00:43:47.800 --> 00:43:51.570 align:middle line:84%
And so the line,
it turns out, has

00:43:51.570 --> 00:43:55.000 align:middle line:84%
been showing up consistently
when I use the word father.

00:43:55.000 --> 00:43:59.410 align:middle line:10%
And when I used the circle
for the word, children,

00:43:59.410 --> 00:44:01.210 align:middle line:10%
that also came up.

00:44:01.210 --> 00:44:05.440 align:middle line:10%
So when I separated them
as children and father,

00:44:05.440 --> 00:44:07.990 align:middle line:10%
I saw that they showed
up the same symbols.

00:44:07.990 --> 00:44:13.360 align:middle line:84%
But when I put them together
and I put father's children.

00:44:13.360 --> 00:44:16.230 align:middle line:10%
And when I also put
children of the father,

00:44:16.230 --> 00:44:18.510 align:middle line:10%
that symbol with
the circle and line

00:44:18.510 --> 00:44:22.270 align:middle line:10%
showed up, exactly as what
I'm seeing in Antarctica.

00:44:22.270 --> 00:44:24.210 align:middle line:10%
So if you put that
together, what we're

00:44:24.210 --> 00:44:27.210 align:middle line:10%
seeing in the Antarctica
water is the children

00:44:27.210 --> 00:44:29.940 align:middle line:10%
of the father are rising up.

00:44:29.940 --> 00:44:31.920 align:middle line:10%
What that means,
I'm not sure, but it

00:44:31.920 --> 00:44:36.562 align:middle line:10%
feels big because every time,
I say it, I get goosebumps.

00:44:36.562 --> 00:44:37.990 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: That's just beautiful.

00:44:37.990 --> 00:44:39.850 align:middle line:84%
Well, I want to say
thank you again.

00:44:39.850 --> 00:44:41.620 align:middle line:84%
Your book is
absolutely beautiful.

00:44:41.620 --> 00:44:43.590 align:middle line:84%
We want to say
right, now, people

00:44:43.590 --> 00:44:45.370 align:middle line:84%
go on Amazon looking
for your book.

00:44:45.370 --> 00:44:47.380 align:middle line:90%
And there's your book for $500.

00:44:47.380 --> 00:44:49.470 align:middle line:84%
But that's not the
book you just wrote,

00:44:49.470 --> 00:44:52.340 align:middle line:84%
and somebody's just trying
to con someone into getting.

00:44:52.340 --> 00:44:53.360 align:middle line:90%
>>AUSTIN: Yeah.

00:44:53.360 --> 00:44:56.150 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Where do they
find your real book, which

00:44:56.150 --> 00:44:59.070 align:middle line:84%
is more in an affordable
neighborhood of, what? $60?

00:44:59.070 --> 00:44:59.870 align:middle line:90%
>>AUSTIN: Yeah.

00:44:59.870 --> 00:45:03.080 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Very fair for
these incredible plates

00:45:03.080 --> 00:45:04.350 align:middle line:90%
all throughout the book.

00:45:04.350 --> 00:45:04.800 align:middle line:90%
>>AUSTIN: Thank you.

00:45:04.800 --> 00:45:06.270 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: These
pictures, unbelievable.

00:45:06.270 --> 00:45:07.070 align:middle line:90%
>>AUSTIN: Yeah.

00:45:07.070 --> 00:45:10.230 align:middle line:84%
There's over 1,500 photos in the
book, and it's over 300 pages.

00:45:10.230 --> 00:45:11.610 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: It's just beautiful.

00:45:11.610 --> 00:45:13.610 align:middle line:84%
>>AUSTIN: And I've put
my heart and soul into it

00:45:13.610 --> 00:45:14.840 align:middle line:90%
and self-published.

00:45:14.840 --> 00:45:16.340 align:middle line:90%
And I didn't go through Amazon.

00:45:16.340 --> 00:45:18.090 align:middle line:84%
It's called, The Living
Language Of Water.

00:45:18.090 --> 00:45:19.740 align:middle line:10%
And they can get
it from my website,

00:45:19.740 --> 00:45:21.920 align:middle line:10%
which is vedaaustin.com.

00:45:21.920 --> 00:45:23.550 align:middle line:10%
And the one that's on Amazon.

00:45:23.550 --> 00:45:25.383 align:middle line:10%
I'm so glad you brought
up because I'm like,

00:45:25.383 --> 00:45:27.740 align:middle line:10%
I can't believe someone's
trying to extort someone.

00:45:27.740 --> 00:45:29.960 align:middle line:84%
It's my old book,
which was called,

00:45:29.960 --> 00:45:32.250 align:middle line:84%
The Secret
Intelligence of Water.

00:45:32.250 --> 00:45:35.370 align:middle line:84%
But what's in that
is in my book.

00:45:35.370 --> 00:45:37.320 align:middle line:90%
And my book has so much more.

00:45:37.320 --> 00:45:39.320 align:middle line:84%
So I really advise people,
don't take that bait.

00:45:39.320 --> 00:45:41.550 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Don't go to Amazon
to look for your book.

00:45:41.550 --> 00:45:42.350 align:middle line:90%
>>AUSTIN: Don't

00:45:42.350 --> 00:45:43.467 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHTER]

00:45:43.467 --> 00:45:45.300 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Well, I want
to thank you so much.

00:45:45.300 --> 00:45:47.090 align:middle line:84%
Do you know what else I
noticed on Amazon, though,

00:45:47.090 --> 00:45:48.715 align:middle line:84%
one day, I don't know
why it popped up,

00:45:48.715 --> 00:45:51.640 align:middle line:84%
probably for this
conversation, is

00:45:51.640 --> 00:45:55.450 align:middle line:84%
it's only like, $16 to buy a
stack of these Petri dishes

00:45:55.450 --> 00:45:56.960 align:middle line:90%
that you use.

00:45:56.960 --> 00:45:57.900 align:middle line:90%
They're cheap.

00:45:57.900 --> 00:45:58.700 align:middle line:90%
>>AUSTIN: Oh, yeah.

00:45:58.700 --> 00:46:00.680 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: You can go on, and
then they can go to your site,

00:46:00.680 --> 00:46:02.847 align:middle line:84%
follow what you do and learn
how to make the crystal

00:46:02.847 --> 00:46:03.905 align:middle line:90%
images themselves.

00:46:03.905 --> 00:46:04.780 align:middle line:90%
>>AUSTIN: Absolutely.

00:46:04.780 --> 00:46:05.583 align:middle line:90%
And it's so simple.

00:46:05.583 --> 00:46:07.250 align:middle line:84%
And even if you don't
have a Petri dish,

00:46:07.250 --> 00:46:09.410 align:middle line:84%
you can use a glass
baking tray at home.

00:46:09.410 --> 00:46:10.740 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: But they're so cheap.

00:46:10.740 --> 00:46:11.540 align:middle line:90%
Why not.

00:46:11.540 --> 00:46:12.650 align:middle line:90%
>>AUSTIN: I do prefer them.

00:46:12.650 --> 00:46:13.040 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:46:13.040 --> 00:46:13.780 align:middle line:90%
And they're clean.

00:46:13.780 --> 00:46:14.960 align:middle line:84%
They're sterile
when they arrive.

00:46:14.960 --> 00:46:15.220 align:middle line:90%
>>AUSTIN: Yeah.

00:46:15.220 --> 00:46:17.262 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: I just want to
thank you so much, Veda.

00:46:17.262 --> 00:46:19.990 align:middle line:84%
I know you have just an
amazing career of discovery

00:46:19.990 --> 00:46:21.398 align:middle line:90%
that still lies ahead of you.

00:46:21.398 --> 00:46:22.940 align:middle line:84%
And thank you for
keeping us updated.

00:46:22.940 --> 00:46:24.607 align:middle line:84%
I'm sure we'll be
seeing you here again.

00:46:24.607 --> 00:46:25.840 align:middle line:90%
>>AUSTIN: Thank you so much.

00:46:25.840 --> 00:46:27.860 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: To follow
Veda's amazing work,

00:46:27.860 --> 00:46:30.020 align:middle line:90%
you can go to vedaaustin.com.

00:46:30.020 --> 00:46:32.350 align:middle line:84%
You can also begin
experimenting yourself.

00:46:32.350 --> 00:46:34.840 align:middle line:84%
As we just talked about,
get some Petri dishes

00:46:34.840 --> 00:46:37.700 align:middle line:84%
or well, use a
glass baking dish.

00:46:37.700 --> 00:46:40.780 align:middle line:84%
Until next time, thank you for
joining us here on Open Minds.
