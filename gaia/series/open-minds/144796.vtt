>>REGINA MEREDITH:
We all understand

00:00:30.300 --> 00:00:31.920 align:middle line:10%
that art imitates
life, but what's

00:00:31.920 --> 00:00:34.560 align:middle line:10%
really fascinating is
when life imitates art.

00:00:34.560 --> 00:00:37.050 align:middle line:84%
This is also where
conspiracy comes in,

00:00:37.050 --> 00:00:39.420 align:middle line:84%
hiding in plain
sight, as it were.

00:00:39.420 --> 00:00:42.900 align:middle line:84%
Jay Dyer analyzes the hidden
symbolism in Hollywood films

00:00:42.900 --> 00:00:45.870 align:middle line:84%
and shows us how the agendas
for humanity's future

00:00:45.870 --> 00:00:49.280 align:middle line:84%
have all been laid out for
us to see, if we choose to.

00:00:49.280 --> 00:00:51.450 align:middle line:84%
And most of us do not--
that's the other half

00:00:51.450 --> 00:00:52.710 align:middle line:90%
of that sentence.

00:00:52.710 --> 00:00:55.230 align:middle line:84%
Welcome, I find your
work really fascinating.

00:00:55.230 --> 00:00:57.180 align:middle line:84%
And we were talking
a bit off camera.

00:00:57.180 --> 00:01:00.180 align:middle line:84%
And I've even written
blogs about where

00:01:00.180 --> 00:01:02.170 align:middle line:84%
are philosophers
when we need them,

00:01:02.170 --> 00:01:04.560 align:middle line:84%
where is Socrates
when we need him.

00:01:04.560 --> 00:01:06.750 align:middle line:84%
And that's your
background, right?

00:01:06.750 --> 00:01:08.956 align:middle line:10%
>>JAY DYER: It
is, yes, actually.

00:01:08.956 --> 00:01:10.830 align:middle line:10%
There aren't philosophers
because it has been

00:01:10.830 --> 00:01:12.360 align:middle line:10%
intentionally done away with.

00:01:12.360 --> 00:01:12.690 align:middle line:10%
The whole idea--

00:01:12.690 --> 00:01:13.320 align:middle line:10%
>>REGINA: Yes it has.

00:01:13.320 --> 00:01:15.690 align:middle line:10%
>>DYER: The liberal arts,
critical thinking, logic--

00:01:15.690 --> 00:01:18.930 align:middle line:10%
all these things have been
intentionally weeded out

00:01:18.930 --> 00:01:20.930 align:middle line:10%
of the educational system.

00:01:20.930 --> 00:01:27.330 align:middle line:10%
So I love the ability to go in
and dissect films to compare it

00:01:27.330 --> 00:01:30.330 align:middle line:10%
with what's happening in
geopolitics, modern politics,

00:01:30.330 --> 00:01:31.650 align:middle line:10%
literature, any of those areas.

00:01:31.650 --> 00:01:34.350 align:middle line:10%
And what we see in
art is, like you said,

00:01:34.350 --> 00:01:36.272 align:middle line:10%
it's a real
presentation of what's

00:01:36.272 --> 00:01:38.730 align:middle line:10%
going on, as opposed to what
we often see in the mainstream

00:01:38.730 --> 00:01:39.530 align:middle line:10%
news.

00:01:39.530 --> 00:01:42.500 align:middle line:84%
So you actually get more
truth nowadays in fiction

00:01:42.500 --> 00:01:44.697 align:middle line:84%
than you'll get on
mainstream truthful news.

00:01:44.697 --> 00:01:45.780 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: No, that's true.

00:01:45.780 --> 00:01:51.090 align:middle line:84%
And it's as though media is
the modern iteration of the use

00:01:51.090 --> 00:01:53.070 align:middle line:90%
of philosophical thinking now.

00:01:53.070 --> 00:01:54.444 align:middle line:90%
There is no other venue for it.

00:01:54.444 --> 00:01:55.860 align:middle line:84%
It's certainly not
going to happen

00:01:55.860 --> 00:01:58.507 align:middle line:84%
in politics,
business, education--

00:01:58.507 --> 00:01:59.340 align:middle line:90%
not going to happen.

00:01:59.340 --> 00:02:01.140 align:middle line:84%
Critical thinking is not
happening there at all.

00:02:01.140 --> 00:02:01.940 align:middle line:90%
>>DYER: Right.

00:02:01.940 --> 00:02:05.270 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: I mean, it's
really mostly repeat, right--

00:02:05.270 --> 00:02:06.070 align:middle line:90%
repeat after me.

00:02:06.070 --> 00:02:06.870 align:middle line:90%
>>DYER: It is.

00:02:06.870 --> 00:02:08.581 align:middle line:84%
And I think we're
going to get into that.

00:02:08.581 --> 00:02:11.039 align:middle line:84%
You talk about repeating, and
there's an ancient Greek idea

00:02:11.039 --> 00:02:12.510 align:middle line:90%
of mimesis.

00:02:12.510 --> 00:02:14.700 align:middle line:84%
And this is crucial to
the Greek conception

00:02:14.700 --> 00:02:15.690 align:middle line:90%
of art and philosophy.

00:02:15.690 --> 00:02:17.750 align:middle line:90%
And what that is is a copy.

00:02:17.750 --> 00:02:19.560 align:middle line:84%
And so Philip K.
Dick, for example,

00:02:19.560 --> 00:02:21.180 align:middle line:84%
actually used this
as a title in one

00:02:21.180 --> 00:02:23.000 align:middle line:90%
of his stories, "Simulacra."

00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:26.160 align:middle line:84%
And that's going
to play into all

00:02:26.160 --> 00:02:27.960 align:middle line:84%
of the analyses of
the Philip K. Dick

00:02:27.960 --> 00:02:31.749 align:middle line:84%
films in terms of how it's about
a synthetic virtual reality.

00:02:31.749 --> 00:02:33.540 align:middle line:84%
And some of the most
important philosophers

00:02:33.540 --> 00:02:37.200 align:middle line:84%
of the 20th century actually
wrote really influential

00:02:37.200 --> 00:02:38.430 align:middle line:90%
treatises on that.

00:02:38.430 --> 00:02:40.790 align:middle line:84%
Jean Baudrillard
wrote a whole essay

00:02:40.790 --> 00:02:44.650 align:middle line:84%
within a book that's called
"Simulacra and Simulation."

00:02:44.650 --> 00:02:46.800 align:middle line:84%
And what he talks about
is how we're being

00:02:46.800 --> 00:02:48.340 align:middle line:90%
immersed into a virtual realm.

00:02:48.340 --> 00:02:49.140 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:02:49.140 --> 00:02:50.598 align:middle line:84%
>>DYER: That is
intended to replace

00:02:50.598 --> 00:02:52.740 align:middle line:84%
a sort of synthetic
overlay, that's intended

00:02:52.740 --> 00:02:54.480 align:middle line:90%
to replace the real world.

00:02:54.480 --> 00:02:55.750 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Organic thought.

00:02:55.750 --> 00:02:56.550 align:middle line:90%
>>DYER: Exactly.

00:02:56.550 --> 00:02:59.520 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And we're getting
into some really cool films.

00:02:59.520 --> 00:03:01.410 align:middle line:84%
First of all, before
we get into that,

00:03:01.410 --> 00:03:04.810 align:middle line:84%
how did you decide to apply
your philosophical bent

00:03:04.810 --> 00:03:06.435 align:middle line:90%
into the world of film?

00:03:06.435 --> 00:03:10.620 align:middle line:84%
>>DYER: Well, my family was a
big fan of the arts, always,

00:03:10.620 --> 00:03:12.280 align:middle line:90%
and my mom was a librarian.

00:03:12.280 --> 00:03:14.220 align:middle line:84%
So I was surrounded
by literature,

00:03:14.220 --> 00:03:15.450 align:middle line:90%
surrounded by stories.

00:03:15.450 --> 00:03:17.160 align:middle line:90%
And naturally I loved movies.

00:03:17.160 --> 00:03:19.596 align:middle line:84%
So I always wanted to
do comedy and theater.

00:03:19.596 --> 00:03:20.970 align:middle line:84%
Did a lot of that
in high school.

00:03:20.970 --> 00:03:24.300 align:middle line:84%
But when I got into
undergrad and grad school,

00:03:24.300 --> 00:03:28.644 align:middle line:84%
I decided to focus on the
most relevant versions

00:03:28.644 --> 00:03:30.060 align:middle line:84%
of those things
that I could find.

00:03:30.060 --> 00:03:33.300 align:middle line:84%
And I drifted towards
philosophy because that

00:03:33.300 --> 00:03:35.430 align:middle line:84%
is such an overarching
thing that can combine

00:03:35.430 --> 00:03:36.960 align:middle line:90%
all of these fields into one.

00:03:36.960 --> 00:03:38.916 align:middle line:84%
And so you can do a
philosophy of film,

00:03:38.916 --> 00:03:40.415 align:middle line:84%
you could do a
philosophy of comedy,

00:03:40.415 --> 00:03:43.140 align:middle line:84%
you could do a philosophy
of economics-- anything.

00:03:43.140 --> 00:03:46.210 align:middle line:84%
And it's a way to have a
big skill picture of things.

00:03:46.210 --> 00:03:49.350 align:middle line:84%
So I looked at the
possibility of starting a blog

00:03:49.350 --> 00:03:52.380 align:middle line:84%
and eventually trying to
write a book, which I did,

00:03:52.380 --> 00:03:55.530 align:middle line:84%
that combined a whole
bunch of film analyses.

00:03:55.530 --> 00:03:56.340 align:middle line:90%
But they're not--

00:03:56.340 --> 00:03:57.631 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: "Esoteric Hollywood."

00:03:57.631 --> 00:03:59.981 align:middle line:84%
>>DYER: It's not Roger Ebert,
it's Roger Ebert on acid.

00:03:59.981 --> 00:04:00.980 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right, gotcha.

00:04:00.980 --> 00:04:02.563 align:middle line:84%
>>DYER: I don't like
to talk about it.

00:04:02.563 --> 00:04:04.320 align:middle line:84%
So we're going to
look at everything

00:04:04.320 --> 00:04:06.310 align:middle line:84%
from the occult layer
to the geopolitical,

00:04:06.310 --> 00:04:09.690 align:middle line:84%
the philosophical layer,
the satirical layer.

00:04:09.690 --> 00:04:11.130 align:middle line:84%
Any of these layers
will actually

00:04:11.130 --> 00:04:14.701 align:middle line:84%
show us, as I say, more reality
than the mainstream news.

00:04:14.701 --> 00:04:16.159 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Absolutely,
and it's kind

00:04:16.159 --> 00:04:18.870 align:middle line:84%
of following in the footsteps
of our in-house man, Jay

00:04:18.870 --> 00:04:21.269 align:middle line:84%
Wagner, who has done a lot
of film analyses in his day

00:04:21.269 --> 00:04:21.600 align:middle line:90%
as well.

00:04:21.600 --> 00:04:22.420 align:middle line:90%
And you guys--

00:04:22.420 --> 00:04:25.470 align:middle line:84%
Jay, Jay-- you guys are quite
the pair on your analyses

00:04:25.470 --> 00:04:27.420 align:middle line:90%
and you both do beautiful work.

00:04:27.420 --> 00:04:28.350 align:middle line:90%
>>DYER: I'm a big fan.

00:04:28.350 --> 00:04:30.510 align:middle line:90%
I loved his Kubrick analyses.

00:04:30.510 --> 00:04:32.380 align:middle line:84%
And actually when
I saw his stuff,

00:04:32.380 --> 00:04:34.440 align:middle line:84%
I'd written a few
film analyses by then.

00:04:34.440 --> 00:04:36.189 align:middle line:84%
I thought, you know
what, if he can do it,

00:04:36.189 --> 00:04:37.560 align:middle line:90%
I should write a book too.

00:04:37.560 --> 00:04:39.750 align:middle line:84%
And I think we really
resonate because we

00:04:39.750 --> 00:04:42.180 align:middle line:84%
have a lot of the
same analyses, which

00:04:42.180 --> 00:04:44.280 align:middle line:84%
I think speaks to the
truthfulness of what we're

00:04:44.280 --> 00:04:45.080 align:middle line:90%
talking about.

00:04:45.080 --> 00:04:46.110 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: I agree.

00:04:46.110 --> 00:04:49.350 align:middle line:84%
>>DYER: I was in college
studying film and taking

00:04:49.350 --> 00:04:51.392 align:middle line:84%
film classes, and taking
philosophy classes.

00:04:51.392 --> 00:04:53.850 align:middle line:84%
And everybody's going to watch
"2001" if you're in college,

00:04:53.850 --> 00:04:55.320 align:middle line:90%
it's required.

00:04:55.320 --> 00:04:59.260 align:middle line:84%
So everything that I
saw in the film really

00:04:59.260 --> 00:05:00.760 align:middle line:84%
resonated with what
he talked about.

00:05:00.760 --> 00:05:02.210 align:middle line:84%
Now there's a couple of
divergences that we have.

00:05:02.210 --> 00:05:03.874 align:middle line:84%
But overall, we're
on the same page.

00:05:03.874 --> 00:05:05.790 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Well, and it's
needed because that's

00:05:05.790 --> 00:05:07.680 align:middle line:84%
where people's
attention is drawn,

00:05:07.680 --> 00:05:09.150 align:middle line:90%
which is whatever is easy.

00:05:09.150 --> 00:05:10.920 align:middle line:84%
And whatever can be
engaged with easily,

00:05:10.920 --> 00:05:14.130 align:middle line:84%
that's what we as a species
have been conditioned to.

00:05:14.130 --> 00:05:18.960 align:middle line:84%
So not only is the analysis
of films absolutely

00:05:18.960 --> 00:05:22.470 align:middle line:84%
essential to pull
the layers back,

00:05:22.470 --> 00:05:26.460 align:middle line:84%
but also to understand
the degree of manipulation

00:05:26.460 --> 00:05:28.260 align:middle line:84%
for the masses
themselves, to understand

00:05:28.260 --> 00:05:29.430 align:middle line:84%
the degree of
manipulation that's

00:05:29.430 --> 00:05:30.570 align:middle line:90%
happening through the media.

00:05:30.570 --> 00:05:32.278 align:middle line:84%
>>DYER: You know what's
amazing is that I

00:05:32.278 --> 00:05:34.140 align:middle line:90%
mentioned the Greeks earlier.

00:05:34.140 --> 00:05:36.060 align:middle line:84%
I did a lecture series
on "Plato's Republic,"

00:05:36.060 --> 00:05:37.800 align:middle line:90%
all 10 books of it.

00:05:37.800 --> 00:05:39.660 align:middle line:84%
And what you'll find
out is that Plato even

00:05:39.660 --> 00:05:41.880 align:middle line:84%
talked about in
his day the ability

00:05:41.880 --> 00:05:46.620 align:middle line:84%
of the theater and drama and
music combined with it to be

00:05:46.620 --> 00:05:49.060 align:middle line:84%
used at the behest of the
state to actually manipulate

00:05:49.060 --> 00:05:49.860 align:middle line:90%
the population.

00:05:49.860 --> 00:05:51.240 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: He was right on.

00:05:51.240 --> 00:05:53.669 align:middle line:84%
>>DYER: So even in his
day it was the exact same.

00:05:53.669 --> 00:05:55.210 align:middle line:84%
It was no different
than it is today.

00:05:55.210 --> 00:05:57.540 align:middle line:84%
And so now the
techniques have just

00:05:57.540 --> 00:06:03.300 align:middle line:84%
been so specified with
scientific precision

00:06:03.300 --> 00:06:06.330 align:middle line:84%
that psychological warfare
and propaganda have all

00:06:06.330 --> 00:06:08.190 align:middle line:84%
been combined by
the state apparatus

00:06:08.190 --> 00:06:10.150 align:middle line:84%
to basically give
us our world view.

00:06:10.150 --> 00:06:12.905 align:middle line:10%
And that's what I try to
deconstruct and oppose.

00:06:12.905 --> 00:06:16.290 align:middle line:10%
>>REGINA: Right, and good
work you do, by the way.

00:06:16.290 --> 00:06:19.590 align:middle line:84%
I'm going to just list off
here some of the subjects

00:06:19.590 --> 00:06:21.150 align:middle line:90%
we are going into--

00:06:21.150 --> 00:06:22.950 align:middle line:84%
weather wars,
predictive programming,

00:06:22.950 --> 00:06:26.010 align:middle line:84%
use of media in programming
humanity, trancehumanism,

00:06:26.010 --> 00:06:29.820 align:middle line:84%
technology and brain interface,
using global weather for larger

00:06:29.820 --> 00:06:34.900 align:middle line:84%
agendas of the elite, AI, time
dimension rifts and realities,

00:06:34.900 --> 00:06:40.080 align:middle line:84%
my favorite-- gravity/love,
eugenics, the Templars,

00:06:40.080 --> 00:06:42.510 align:middle line:84%
Hermetics, Kabbalah,
all of this--

00:06:42.510 --> 00:06:44.880 align:middle line:90%
I mean, the Kabbalah.

00:06:44.880 --> 00:06:46.770 align:middle line:84%
Each of these movies
represent certain

00:06:46.770 --> 00:06:48.630 align:middle line:90%
of these subject matter.

00:06:48.630 --> 00:06:52.890 align:middle line:84%
I thought we would
start with the 1987 film

00:06:52.890 --> 00:06:56.040 align:middle line:84%
starring Arnold Schwarzenegger,
our favorite actor,

00:06:56.040 --> 00:06:57.930 align:middle line:90%
called "The Running Man."

00:06:57.930 --> 00:07:01.360 align:middle line:10%
And by the way, I went back
and watched all of the films

00:07:01.360 --> 00:07:05.400 align:middle line:10%
so that I would have them fresh
in my mind for this interview.

00:07:05.400 --> 00:07:07.980 align:middle line:84%
And I have to say, I
really was impressed

00:07:07.980 --> 00:07:10.080 align:middle line:84%
having seen it so
many years later

00:07:10.080 --> 00:07:16.340 align:middle line:84%
with the degree of accuracy
of the message in this one.

00:07:16.340 --> 00:07:19.150 align:middle line:84%
And so let's just go for it,
let's go for "Running Man."

00:07:19.150 --> 00:07:21.960 align:middle line:84%
Predictive programming using
national news agendas--

00:07:21.960 --> 00:07:23.100 align:middle line:90%
lay out the whole plot.

00:07:23.100 --> 00:07:25.470 align:middle line:84%
>>DYER: "Running Man" is
based on a Stephen King story,

00:07:25.470 --> 00:07:29.640 align:middle line:84%
which is essentially this
idea of gladiatorial games.

00:07:29.640 --> 00:07:32.790 align:middle line:84%
And he's looking back to the
Roman Empire and he's saying,

00:07:32.790 --> 00:07:35.189 align:middle line:84%
the Roman Empire was able
to control its population

00:07:35.189 --> 00:07:37.230 align:middle line:84%
through these large-scale
gladiatorial games that

00:07:37.230 --> 00:07:38.481 align:middle line:90%
involved just total brutality.

00:07:38.481 --> 00:07:39.280 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:07:39.280 --> 00:07:40.770 align:middle line:10%
>>DYER: And so
what's crucial there

00:07:40.770 --> 00:07:43.380 align:middle line:10%
is the desensitization and
brutalization of the populace.

00:07:43.380 --> 00:07:44.180 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:07:44.180 --> 00:07:46.388 align:middle line:84%
>>DYER: Right, so if the
population can be brutalized

00:07:46.388 --> 00:07:48.240 align:middle line:84%
and desensitized,
then they're atomized,

00:07:48.240 --> 00:07:49.860 align:middle line:84%
then they're no
longer interested in

00:07:49.860 --> 00:07:52.710 align:middle line:84%
or have any compassion or
concern for their neighbors.

00:07:52.710 --> 00:07:54.630 align:middle line:84%
That's the key
psychological component

00:07:54.630 --> 00:07:57.300 align:middle line:84%
that Nero understood
when he was putting

00:07:57.300 --> 00:07:58.767 align:middle line:84%
on these grand
gladiatorial games.

00:07:58.767 --> 00:08:00.600 align:middle line:84%
And it's what I think
Stephen King is trying

00:08:00.600 --> 00:08:02.500 align:middle line:90%
to highlight in this story.

00:08:02.500 --> 00:08:04.860 align:middle line:84%
Now when it's put
into the film version,

00:08:04.860 --> 00:08:08.400 align:middle line:84%
there's a little bit of a
divergence between the film

00:08:08.400 --> 00:08:10.890 align:middle line:84%
and what King wanted to
present in his story.

00:08:10.890 --> 00:08:13.140 align:middle line:84%
Now what we get
here is a dystopia

00:08:13.140 --> 00:08:19.650 align:middle line:84%
where unlike a lot of dystopias
the focus is a large scale

00:08:19.650 --> 00:08:22.940 align:middle line:84%
corporate state
conglomerate, the privatized

00:08:22.940 --> 00:08:24.840 align:middle line:84%
and the public sphere
coming together

00:08:24.840 --> 00:08:27.885 align:middle line:84%
in this giant media corporation
that controls reality.

00:08:27.885 --> 00:08:29.715 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Kind of
like BBC or NBC.

00:08:29.715 --> 00:08:31.410 align:middle line:84%
>>DYER: Like any of
those, absolutely.

00:08:31.410 --> 00:08:32.785 align:middle line:84%
And that's why
it's so prescient.

00:08:32.785 --> 00:08:35.070 align:middle line:84%
And it also talks about
the beginning of the film

00:08:35.070 --> 00:08:38.970 align:middle line:84%
this period of total
economic collapse.

00:08:38.970 --> 00:08:41.476 align:middle line:84%
And it's actually talking about
our day, 2016, 2017 period.

00:08:41.476 --> 00:08:42.434 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: That's right.

00:08:42.434 --> 00:08:43.234 align:middle line:90%
>>DYER: And so--

00:08:43.234 --> 00:08:45.336 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: I think
it's set in 2017?

00:08:45.336 --> 00:08:46.957 align:middle line:90%
>>DYER: I think so, yeah.

00:08:46.957 --> 00:08:49.410 align:middle line:84%
And that's pretty
phenomenal because a lot

00:08:49.410 --> 00:08:52.977 align:middle line:84%
of what's in this film in 1987
is our daily existence now.

00:08:52.977 --> 00:08:53.810 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes it is.

00:08:53.810 --> 00:08:56.040 align:middle line:84%
>>DYER: So I don't
think it's accidental.

00:08:56.040 --> 00:08:57.540 align:middle line:84%
And that's one of
the things I often

00:08:57.540 --> 00:09:00.660 align:middle line:84%
talk about is that there are
so many examples of this stuff

00:09:00.660 --> 00:09:02.932 align:middle line:84%
that it can't just
be coincidence

00:09:02.932 --> 00:09:03.890 align:middle line:90%
or happenstance, right?

00:09:03.890 --> 00:09:06.690 align:middle line:84%
I think that a lot of people
in the establishment and people

00:09:06.690 --> 00:09:10.350 align:middle line:84%
that write science fiction
and so forth, screenplays,

00:09:10.350 --> 00:09:12.090 align:middle line:84%
I think that they are
tipped off and they

00:09:12.090 --> 00:09:13.380 align:middle line:90%
know things that are going on.

00:09:13.380 --> 00:09:13.990 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Absolutely.

00:09:13.990 --> 00:09:15.630 align:middle line:84%
>>DYER: So they're
telling us ahead of time,

00:09:15.630 --> 00:09:16.500 align:middle line:84%
and that's predictive
programming

00:09:16.500 --> 00:09:17.500 align:middle line:90%
that we'll get to later.

00:09:17.500 --> 00:09:20.460 align:middle line:84%
But I guess what stands out as
most phenomenal in this film

00:09:20.460 --> 00:09:24.180 align:middle line:84%
is the ability of that
state media apparatus

00:09:24.180 --> 00:09:26.647 align:middle line:84%
to completely manipulate
the population

00:09:26.647 --> 00:09:28.980 align:middle line:84%
through synthetic reality
that we've been talking about.

00:09:28.980 --> 00:09:31.260 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: You know what,
let's take a peek at a clip

00:09:31.260 --> 00:09:33.590 align:middle line:90%
right here that discusses that.

00:09:33.590 --> 00:09:34.740 align:middle line:90%
It demonstrates that.

00:09:34.740 --> 00:09:35.540 align:middle line:90%
>>DYER: OK.

00:09:35.540 --> 00:09:36.720 align:middle line:10%
>>REGINA: OK.

00:09:36.720 --> 00:09:40.300 align:middle line:10%
>> For 50 years, we've told
them what to eat, what to drink,

00:09:40.300 --> 00:09:41.340 align:middle line:10%
what to wear.

00:09:41.340 --> 00:09:44.040 align:middle line:10%
For Christ's sake, Ben,
don't you understand--

00:09:44.040 --> 00:09:45.996 align:middle line:10%
Americans love television.

00:09:45.996 --> 00:09:49.290 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: I mean, I just found
it so interesting-- for 50

00:09:49.290 --> 00:09:52.650 align:middle line:84%
years, we've been telling people
what to eat, what to drink,

00:09:52.650 --> 00:09:53.680 align:middle line:90%
and what to think.

00:09:53.680 --> 00:09:57.480 align:middle line:84%
So backdate that
from 2017, right?

00:09:57.480 --> 00:10:00.030 align:middle line:84%
And essentially,
they have created

00:10:00.030 --> 00:10:02.190 align:middle line:84%
a species of people
that is completely

00:10:02.190 --> 00:10:04.740 align:middle line:90%
lacking in any compassion.

00:10:04.740 --> 00:10:08.160 align:middle line:84%
I mean, like you say,
the gladiatorial throwing

00:10:08.160 --> 00:10:11.530 align:middle line:84%
Christians to the
lions type of scenario.

00:10:11.530 --> 00:10:13.655 align:middle line:84%
>>DYER: And that's what
"Hunger Games" exemplifies.

00:10:13.655 --> 00:10:15.210 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Well, that's
what I wrote down here.

00:10:15.210 --> 00:10:17.520 align:middle line:84%
This is almost like a
precursor to "Hunger Games."

00:10:17.520 --> 00:10:18.870 align:middle line:90%
>>DYER: Absolutely.

00:10:18.870 --> 00:10:21.540 align:middle line:84%
One crucial piece of evidence
I think that demonstrates

00:10:21.540 --> 00:10:24.640 align:middle line:84%
that this is not
coincidence is that is

00:10:24.640 --> 00:10:26.910 align:middle line:84%
there's a scene when
Arnold is on the run,

00:10:26.910 --> 00:10:28.190 align:middle line:90%
he hops on the infonet.

00:10:28.190 --> 00:10:28.990 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:10:28.990 --> 00:10:31.247 align:middle line:84%
>>DYER: And he orders
his plane tickets,

00:10:31.247 --> 00:10:33.330 align:middle line:84%
he's going to try to get
away from the government.

00:10:33.330 --> 00:10:34.130 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:10:34.130 --> 00:10:35.530 align:middle line:90%
>>DYER: And this is 1987.

00:10:35.530 --> 00:10:37.390 align:middle line:84%
Most people, except
for those that

00:10:37.390 --> 00:10:39.040 align:middle line:84%
maybe worked in
the establishment,

00:10:39.040 --> 00:10:41.050 align:middle line:84%
I don't think knew
what the internet was

00:10:41.050 --> 00:10:42.780 align:middle line:90%
or that it was coming in 1987.

00:10:42.780 --> 00:10:44.860 align:middle line:10%
But the film presents
it as a daily reality

00:10:44.860 --> 00:10:47.140 align:middle line:10%
for the people in the dystopia.

00:10:47.140 --> 00:10:51.580 align:middle line:10%
And as we said earlier, the
state apparatus controls music,

00:10:51.580 --> 00:10:53.450 align:middle line:10%
they control the arts.

00:10:53.450 --> 00:10:54.250 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:10:54.250 --> 00:10:55.833 align:middle line:84%
>>DYER: What you can
produce, what you

00:10:55.833 --> 00:10:59.200 align:middle line:84%
can talk about in your
shows, and your lyrics.

00:10:59.200 --> 00:11:01.690 align:middle line:84%
And it's amazing
because it echoes

00:11:01.690 --> 00:11:04.184 align:middle line:84%
not just what we saw
in East Germany, where

00:11:04.184 --> 00:11:05.350 align:middle line:90%
we would see similar things.

00:11:05.350 --> 00:11:07.350 align:middle line:84%
There's a film
called "Das Leben der

00:11:07.350 --> 00:11:09.740 align:middle line:84%
Anderen," which is "The Lives
of Others," which details--

00:11:09.740 --> 00:11:11.300 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Oh, I love
"The Lives of Others."

00:11:11.300 --> 00:11:13.091 align:middle line:84%
>>DYER: The lives of
people in East Germany

00:11:13.091 --> 00:11:15.760 align:middle line:84%
under that strict
communist control.

00:11:15.760 --> 00:11:18.020 align:middle line:84%
And we tend to think in the
West, oh, that's not us,

00:11:18.020 --> 00:11:18.540 align:middle line:90%
that's them.

00:11:18.540 --> 00:11:19.120 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Oh, no.

00:11:19.120 --> 00:11:20.250 align:middle line:90%
>>DYER: It's no different.

00:11:20.250 --> 00:11:22.750 align:middle line:84%
It's just a different selling
point, a different marketing

00:11:22.750 --> 00:11:25.930 align:middle line:84%
tool of the system
that we live under,

00:11:25.930 --> 00:11:28.790 align:middle line:84%
which is that it's combined with
all the scientific techniques

00:11:28.790 --> 00:11:29.590 align:middle line:90%
of mind control.

00:11:29.590 --> 00:11:33.114 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Yes, and
so in this plot,

00:11:33.114 --> 00:11:35.380 align:middle line:84%
Arnold Schwarzenegger,
who goes against an agenda

00:11:35.380 --> 00:11:37.900 align:middle line:84%
to begin with with killing
innocents in a village,

00:11:37.900 --> 00:11:42.040 align:middle line:90%
is now an enemy of the state.

00:11:42.040 --> 00:11:43.930 align:middle line:90%
Now he's the hunted.

00:11:43.930 --> 00:11:46.660 align:middle line:84%
And so in this
particular reality show,

00:11:46.660 --> 00:11:49.900 align:middle line:84%
before reality
shows existed, he is

00:11:49.900 --> 00:11:52.962 align:middle line:84%
the one who's going to
be hunted by the hunters.

00:11:52.962 --> 00:11:53.920 align:middle line:90%
>>DYER: He's the patsy.

00:11:53.920 --> 00:11:55.140 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: He's the patsy.

00:11:55.140 --> 00:11:57.130 align:middle line:84%
>>DYER: And a large
portion of that creation

00:11:57.130 --> 00:12:00.280 align:middle line:84%
of the myth of the patsy
involves the state apparatus

00:12:00.280 --> 00:12:01.685 align:middle line:90%
concocting made-up news.

00:12:01.685 --> 00:12:02.485 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Exactly.

00:12:02.485 --> 00:12:04.550 align:middle line:84%
>>DYER: They just make up
stories about his past.

00:12:04.550 --> 00:12:06.400 align:middle line:84%
They said that he was
involved in this giant terror

00:12:06.400 --> 00:12:08.290 align:middle line:84%
attack, which actually
he was trying to stop it.

00:12:08.290 --> 00:12:09.130 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: He was
trying to stop it.

00:12:09.130 --> 00:12:10.630 align:middle line:84%
>>DYER: Killing all
these civilians.

00:12:10.630 --> 00:12:13.030 align:middle line:84%
So it shows the ability
of the establishment

00:12:13.030 --> 00:12:16.149 align:middle line:84%
to really craft these
backstories, these legends,

00:12:16.149 --> 00:12:17.440 align:middle line:90%
about people that are not true.

00:12:17.440 --> 00:12:20.050 align:middle line:84%
And we know we think of
these people that stand out,

00:12:20.050 --> 00:12:22.060 align:middle line:84%
like maybe Osama bin Laden
or someone like that,

00:12:22.060 --> 00:12:25.360 align:middle line:84%
who previously worked for the
Western establishment in 1979,

00:12:25.360 --> 00:12:29.495 align:middle line:84%
right, in the 1979 Afghanistan
situation with the training

00:12:29.495 --> 00:12:30.745 align:middle line:90%
and recruiting the mujahideen.

00:12:30.745 --> 00:12:31.630 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Exactly.

00:12:31.630 --> 00:12:34.171 align:middle line:84%
>>DYER: And then we see, even
in the '80s Ronald Reagan named

00:12:34.171 --> 00:12:36.790 align:middle line:84%
the space shuttle after
the mujahideen, the freedom

00:12:36.790 --> 00:12:39.490 align:middle line:84%
fighters, which will become
the Taliban and al-Qaeda.

00:12:39.490 --> 00:12:42.610 align:middle line:84%
I mean, it's not
accidental that even

00:12:42.610 --> 00:12:44.360 align:middle line:84%
in mainstream news in
the '80s, you could

00:12:44.360 --> 00:12:45.770 align:middle line:90%
you could see this going on.

00:12:45.770 --> 00:12:47.320 align:middle line:84%
And then of course
into the '90s,

00:12:47.320 --> 00:12:49.571 align:middle line:84%
al-Qaeda becomes the bad guy
with the 1993 World Trade

00:12:49.571 --> 00:12:50.370 align:middle line:90%
Center.

00:12:50.370 --> 00:12:52.120 align:middle line:84%
But it's still the
same establishment

00:12:52.120 --> 00:12:54.835 align:middle line:84%
that runs the good guys and
the bad guys, so-called.

00:12:54.835 --> 00:12:57.180 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Oh yeah,
exactly, it's just a show.

00:12:57.180 --> 00:12:59.050 align:middle line:84%
The whole point being
to lull the public

00:12:59.050 --> 00:13:01.210 align:middle line:84%
into a state of
complete passivity,

00:13:01.210 --> 00:13:04.930 align:middle line:84%
as well as completely
lacking any compassion, which

00:13:04.930 --> 00:13:07.150 align:middle line:84%
is fascinating, because
this is a glitzy game show

00:13:07.150 --> 00:13:10.420 align:middle line:84%
and they keep showing the
audience members as grannies.

00:13:10.420 --> 00:13:12.880 align:middle line:84%
That's what's so interesting
is that there is no one that's

00:13:12.880 --> 00:13:17.050 align:middle line:84%
beyond the control
of this instilling

00:13:17.050 --> 00:13:18.984 align:middle line:84%
brutality and an
acceptance of it.

00:13:18.984 --> 00:13:20.650 align:middle line:84%
>>DYER: There is an
actual term for this

00:13:20.650 --> 00:13:22.610 align:middle line:84%
that the Frankfurt
School theorists--

00:13:22.610 --> 00:13:25.900 align:middle line:84%
these are a group of Eastern
Bloc Marxists that kind of fall

00:13:25.900 --> 00:13:28.450 align:middle line:84%
in the tradition of Karl
Marx, and they wrote primarily

00:13:28.450 --> 00:13:29.770 align:middle line:90%
on culture.

00:13:29.770 --> 00:13:32.327 align:middle line:84%
So they quit caring about the
economic concerns of Marxism

00:13:32.327 --> 00:13:33.160 align:middle line:90%
in the 20th century.

00:13:33.160 --> 00:13:36.050 align:middle line:84%
And they said, we need to focus
on how we can create what they

00:13:36.050 --> 00:13:37.300 align:middle line:90%
called the Theater of Cruelty.

00:13:37.300 --> 00:13:37.960 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:13:37.960 --> 00:13:40.376 align:middle line:84%
>>DYER: And this is the idea
that you can brutalize people

00:13:40.376 --> 00:13:44.680 align:middle line:84%
through such traumatic events
that they are desensitized.

00:13:44.680 --> 00:13:46.900 align:middle line:84%
They kind of fall into
a catatonic state.

00:13:46.900 --> 00:13:49.090 align:middle line:84%
And that's the purpose
of this, gets weaponized.

00:13:49.090 --> 00:13:51.460 align:middle line:84%
And it's actually a warfare
technique that's then

00:13:51.460 --> 00:13:53.200 align:middle line:90%
applied to mass communications.

00:13:53.200 --> 00:13:55.120 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Well,
if you look at it

00:13:55.120 --> 00:13:57.850 align:middle line:84%
from the hypnotic
point-of-view, trauma

00:13:57.850 --> 00:14:03.899 align:middle line:84%
is the greatest foundation
for programming.

00:14:03.899 --> 00:14:05.190 align:middle line:90%
>>DYER: Absolutely, absolutely.

00:14:05.190 --> 00:14:09.460 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Because your being is
open and receptive to anything

00:14:09.460 --> 00:14:11.530 align:middle line:84%
that can feel like
effects because

00:14:11.530 --> 00:14:14.230 align:middle line:84%
of that kind of annihilation
and desperation.

00:14:14.230 --> 00:14:15.146 align:middle line:90%
>>DYER: Right.

00:14:15.146 --> 00:14:17.270 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And in this movie
in particular, but even

00:14:17.270 --> 00:14:19.970 align:middle line:84%
in some of the others, they're
really playing upon that.

00:14:19.970 --> 00:14:24.670 align:middle line:84%
>>DYER: The populace
lusts for this bloodbath.

00:14:24.670 --> 00:14:27.580 align:middle line:84%
They want to see him impaled
on spikes or whatever.

00:14:27.580 --> 00:14:29.650 align:middle line:84%
And they want to
see the big opera

00:14:29.650 --> 00:14:32.467 align:middle line:84%
guy who's decked in
looks like a Lite Bright,

00:14:32.467 --> 00:14:33.800 align:middle line:90%
he's decked in Christmas lights.

00:14:33.800 --> 00:14:34.840 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: He does,
I love this scene.

00:14:34.840 --> 00:14:37.048 align:middle line:84%
That's great, we can show
a little of that right now.

00:14:37.048 --> 00:14:38.414 align:middle line:90%
>>DYER: The Lite Bright killer.

00:14:38.414 --> 00:14:42.100 align:middle line:84%
But I think that what
it shows is again that,

00:14:42.100 --> 00:14:44.020 align:middle line:84%
and if you look at
the history of--

00:14:44.020 --> 00:14:44.910 align:middle line:84%
I don't want to
get too academic--

00:14:44.910 --> 00:14:47.201 align:middle line:84%
but if you look at the history
of the Frankfurt School,

00:14:47.201 --> 00:14:48.970 align:middle line:84%
they were actually
brought over to the US

00:14:48.970 --> 00:14:52.540 align:middle line:84%
at the time of World
War II by the OSS, which

00:14:52.540 --> 00:14:54.580 align:middle line:90%
is the precursor to the CIA.

00:14:54.580 --> 00:14:56.890 align:middle line:84%
The OSS saw that
they could utilize

00:14:56.890 --> 00:14:59.830 align:middle line:84%
the techniques of these
Frankfurt School writers

00:14:59.830 --> 00:15:02.800 align:middle line:90%
for Western propaganda.

00:15:02.800 --> 00:15:05.080 align:middle line:84%
So you would think that
that's counterintuitive.

00:15:05.080 --> 00:15:07.180 align:middle line:84%
Why would the West,
why would the OSS, CIA

00:15:07.180 --> 00:15:09.040 align:middle line:84%
be interested in
these Marxist guys?

00:15:09.040 --> 00:15:12.610 align:middle line:84%
Well, it's because they were
focusing on the weaponization

00:15:12.610 --> 00:15:13.790 align:middle line:90%
of culture.

00:15:13.790 --> 00:15:15.250 align:middle line:84%
And so they saw
that as a technique

00:15:15.250 --> 00:15:19.550 align:middle line:84%
to move masses of opinion
in a certain direction.

00:15:19.550 --> 00:15:22.960 align:middle line:84%
And that's why you get the
tie-in with this these guys,

00:15:22.960 --> 00:15:27.510 align:middle line:84%
and Walter Lippmann
and Edward Bernays.

00:15:27.510 --> 00:15:30.000 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: I was just going to
bring up "Century of Self."

00:15:30.000 --> 00:15:31.874 align:middle line:84%
For anyone who hasn't
seen "Century of Self,"

00:15:31.874 --> 00:15:34.192 align:middle line:84%
that's a fabulous documentary
series to take a look at.

00:15:34.192 --> 00:15:35.650 align:middle line:84%
>>DYER: Yeah, all
the guys who were

00:15:35.650 --> 00:15:40.000 align:middle line:84%
in the OSS, all these guys, they
go into CBS, Sarnoff, Paley.

00:15:40.000 --> 00:15:41.500 align:middle line:84%
And they also worked
at advertising.

00:15:41.500 --> 00:15:42.160 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: And Madison Avenue.

00:15:42.160 --> 00:15:43.950 align:middle line:84%
>>DYER: Advertising in
Madison Avenue, absolutely.

00:15:43.950 --> 00:15:46.150 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Exactly, and that's
what I found fascinating.

00:15:46.150 --> 00:15:48.066 align:middle line:84%
I mean, there's some
examples were incredible.

00:15:48.066 --> 00:15:49.870 align:middle line:84%
So we'll just take
another look at a clip

00:15:49.870 --> 00:15:52.200 align:middle line:84%
where he's looking at the
news saying, wait a minute.

00:15:52.200 --> 00:15:54.542 align:middle line:84%
They're playing the news
about this traitor, Arnold

00:15:54.542 --> 00:15:56.500 align:middle line:84%
Schwarzenegger, and he's
looking at it, saying,

00:15:56.500 --> 00:15:59.377 align:middle line:84%
that's not what happened,
the opposite happened.

00:15:59.377 --> 00:16:00.960 align:middle line:84%
This happens all the
time in the news.

00:16:00.960 --> 00:16:02.400 align:middle line:90%
So let's take another peek.

00:16:02.400 --> 00:16:05.470 align:middle line:10%
>> Richards, a former police
officer was the helicopter

00:16:05.470 --> 00:16:10.420 align:middle line:10%
pilot who went berserk 18 months
ago without warning on a crowd

00:16:10.420 --> 00:16:12.716 align:middle line:10%
of innocent civilians.

00:16:12.716 --> 00:16:14.680 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Another
thing, the competitors

00:16:14.680 --> 00:16:17.310 align:middle line:90%
had RFID chips in their collars.

00:16:17.310 --> 00:16:19.810 align:middle line:84%
Well of course this was long
before we had any understanding

00:16:19.810 --> 00:16:20.851 align:middle line:90%
that such a thing exists.

00:16:20.851 --> 00:16:22.107 align:middle line:90%
Talk about that for a moment.

00:16:22.107 --> 00:16:24.190 align:middle line:84%
>>DYER: Believe it or not,
that actually comes out

00:16:24.190 --> 00:16:25.419 align:middle line:90%
of the MKULTRA program.

00:16:25.419 --> 00:16:27.210 align:middle line:84%
There is an excellent
book that was written

00:16:27.210 --> 00:16:28.250 align:middle line:90%
by a guy named John Marks.

00:16:28.250 --> 00:16:30.666 align:middle line:84%
And it's called "The Search
for the Manchurian Candidate."

00:16:30.666 --> 00:16:32.360 align:middle line:84%
And in the last
chapter of that book--

00:16:32.360 --> 00:16:33.760 align:middle line:84%
that's probably the most
important chapter in that

00:16:33.760 --> 00:16:34.560 align:middle line:90%
book--

00:16:34.560 --> 00:16:37.940 align:middle line:84%
he talks about the
fact that MKULTRA, when

00:16:37.940 --> 00:16:40.000 align:middle line:84%
it was investigated and
supposedly shut down,

00:16:40.000 --> 00:16:43.660 align:middle line:84%
it would actually transition
into what's called MKSEARCH.

00:16:43.660 --> 00:16:45.640 align:middle line:84%
That was moved to
Fort Detrick and it

00:16:45.640 --> 00:16:47.876 align:middle line:90%
dealt with biological warfare.

00:16:47.876 --> 00:16:49.750 align:middle line:10%
So you can see the
connection between the use

00:16:49.750 --> 00:16:53.170 align:middle line:10%
of hallucinogens, LSD,
different ergots and so forth,

00:16:53.170 --> 00:16:55.850 align:middle line:10%
and how that would tie
into chemical warfare.

00:16:55.850 --> 00:16:57.490 align:middle line:84%
Now that's not all
they did there.

00:16:57.490 --> 00:17:00.550 align:middle line:84%
They also experimented
with electronic implants,

00:17:00.550 --> 00:17:02.170 align:middle line:90%
electrodes, and so forth.

00:17:02.170 --> 00:17:06.430 align:middle line:10%
This is where we get the MKULTRA
doctors like Jose Delgado, Dr.

00:17:06.430 --> 00:17:10.510 align:middle line:10%
Jolyon West, Dr. Ewen
Cameron, and others

00:17:10.510 --> 00:17:14.745 align:middle line:10%
testing out the possibility
of the implantable microchip.

00:17:14.745 --> 00:17:16.119 align:middle line:84%
And one other
point I'll make too

00:17:16.119 --> 00:17:19.810 align:middle line:84%
is that you can find Dr. Ewen
Cameron's research into what's

00:17:19.810 --> 00:17:21.400 align:middle line:90%
called a Schwitzgebel machine.

00:17:21.400 --> 00:17:25.720 align:middle line:84%
And this was actually
used for prison inmates.

00:17:25.720 --> 00:17:29.389 align:middle line:84%
And everybody's seen
this sort of the tag,

00:17:29.389 --> 00:17:30.680 align:middle line:90%
that you're like Lindsay Lohan.

00:17:30.680 --> 00:17:31.260 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right, right.

00:17:31.260 --> 00:17:32.830 align:middle line:84%
>>DYER: Where you're wearing
that thing on their leg.

00:17:32.830 --> 00:17:35.170 align:middle line:84%
Well, this is an older
plan from the '70s.

00:17:35.170 --> 00:17:37.630 align:middle line:10%
And it was this machine
that they concocted

00:17:37.630 --> 00:17:40.522 align:middle line:10%
that would actually tell you not
just the prisoner's location,

00:17:40.522 --> 00:17:41.980 align:middle line:10%
but also tell you
their heart rate.

00:17:41.980 --> 00:17:44.302 align:middle line:84%
So we think of maybe like
watches that we wear now.

00:17:44.302 --> 00:17:45.260 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right, right.

00:17:45.260 --> 00:17:47.593 align:middle line:84%
>>DYER: But now, so you say,
what was the point of that.

00:17:47.593 --> 00:17:49.780 align:middle line:84%
Well, it was a
psychological experiment

00:17:49.780 --> 00:17:52.330 align:middle line:84%
to see what would
happen to prisoners

00:17:52.330 --> 00:17:55.370 align:middle line:84%
who knew that they were
being watched at all times.

00:17:55.370 --> 00:17:56.620 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: At all times, right.

00:17:56.620 --> 00:17:59.320 align:middle line:84%
>>DYER: Much like the NSA
and the leaks that were told.

00:17:59.320 --> 00:18:00.400 align:middle line:90%
And so what does it do?

00:18:00.400 --> 00:18:03.640 align:middle line:84%
The chief technique or
the chief effect of that

00:18:03.640 --> 00:18:05.535 align:middle line:90%
is that people will self-police.

00:18:05.535 --> 00:18:06.910 align:middle line:84%
So the establishment
doesn't have

00:18:06.910 --> 00:18:09.790 align:middle line:84%
to worry about
what they're saying

00:18:09.790 --> 00:18:11.510 align:middle line:84%
or what they're
putting out as much.

00:18:11.510 --> 00:18:15.750 align:middle line:84%
If the people know that they're
being watched at all times,

00:18:15.750 --> 00:18:17.020 align:middle line:90%
they'll police themselves.

00:18:17.020 --> 00:18:19.780 align:middle line:84%
And you can actually
show that that

00:18:19.780 --> 00:18:21.977 align:middle line:84%
was a defined
technique coming out

00:18:21.977 --> 00:18:23.560 align:middle line:84%
of what's called
Panopticism, and this

00:18:23.560 --> 00:18:25.680 align:middle line:84%
is philosophers
like Jeremy Bentham,

00:18:25.680 --> 00:18:27.610 align:middle line:84%
Michel Foucault has
written a whole treatise

00:18:27.610 --> 00:18:30.060 align:middle line:84%
on this about how the prison
system that they erected

00:18:30.060 --> 00:18:32.230 align:middle line:84%
in the 1700s in
France and Britain,

00:18:32.230 --> 00:18:34.230 align:middle line:90%
it was basically an octagon.

00:18:34.230 --> 00:18:36.190 align:middle line:84%
In the center, you
had this guard tower

00:18:36.190 --> 00:18:38.530 align:middle line:84%
that could look in on the
prisoners at all times.

00:18:38.530 --> 00:18:41.460 align:middle line:84%
And the inner side of
their cells were open.

00:18:41.460 --> 00:18:43.995 align:middle line:84%
And you didn't even have to
have a guard in the tower

00:18:43.995 --> 00:18:45.120 align:middle line:90%
because it was blacked out.

00:18:45.120 --> 00:18:45.940 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: It was symbol for it.

00:18:45.940 --> 00:18:47.740 align:middle line:84%
>>DYER: Yes, and so you never
knew when you were being

00:18:47.740 --> 00:18:48.906 align:middle line:90%
watched or when you weren't.

00:18:48.906 --> 00:18:50.410 align:middle line:84%
And that just
caused self-policing

00:18:50.410 --> 00:18:51.496 align:middle line:90%
and self-censorship.

00:18:51.496 --> 00:18:53.620 align:middle line:84%
That's the whole point of
the Schwitzgebel machine.

00:18:53.620 --> 00:18:55.000 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Interesting,
and that's

00:18:55.000 --> 00:18:58.510 align:middle line:84%
the way people justify, well,
if you don't have anything

00:18:58.510 --> 00:19:02.312 align:middle line:84%
to hide, then why do we mind
if anybody is watching us.

00:19:02.312 --> 00:19:03.520 align:middle line:90%
That's the flip side of that.

00:19:03.520 --> 00:19:05.380 align:middle line:84%
>>DYER: Well, why don't we
all just live in glass houses

00:19:05.380 --> 00:19:06.230 align:middle line:90%
then, right?

00:19:06.230 --> 00:19:08.282 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Exactly, I
mean, it is interesting

00:19:08.282 --> 00:19:10.330 align:middle line:84%
how we are we being
manipulated down that road.

00:19:10.330 --> 00:19:12.295 align:middle line:84%
I've heard so many intelligent
people say, well, I

00:19:12.295 --> 00:19:13.150 align:middle line:90%
don't have anything to hide.

00:19:13.150 --> 00:19:14.358 align:middle line:90%
What difference does it make.

00:19:14.358 --> 00:19:16.030 align:middle line:90%
It's like, holy cow.

00:19:16.030 --> 00:19:17.870 align:middle line:84%
"Manchurian
Candidate," by the way,

00:19:17.870 --> 00:19:19.245 align:middle line:84%
we're not going
to talk about it.

00:19:19.245 --> 00:19:20.810 align:middle line:84%
Another absolutely
fabulous film.

00:19:20.810 --> 00:19:23.365 align:middle line:84%
And I interviewed a
woman Cathy O'Brien--

00:19:23.365 --> 00:19:25.600 align:middle line:90%
do you know Cathy's work?

00:19:25.600 --> 00:19:27.910 align:middle line:90%
Quite challenging.

00:19:27.910 --> 00:19:30.910 align:middle line:84%
But anyway, she described some
of the techniques used and some

00:19:30.910 --> 00:19:34.690 align:middle line:84%
of the people in our
current political scene

00:19:34.690 --> 00:19:38.640 align:middle line:84%
who were Manchurian candidates,
who she watched being broken

00:19:38.640 --> 00:19:40.180 align:middle line:90%
in the same way she was broken.

00:19:40.180 --> 00:19:42.010 align:middle line:84%
I don't want to get
into the names of them.

00:19:42.010 --> 00:19:44.830 align:middle line:84%
But this is a common phenomena
in the American and other

00:19:44.830 --> 00:19:46.370 align:middle line:90%
political scene, I'm imagining.

00:19:46.370 --> 00:19:48.370 align:middle line:84%
>>DYER: Yeah, I know I
went down a rabbit trail.

00:19:48.370 --> 00:19:51.185 align:middle line:84%
But what I was talking
about is exactly what

00:19:51.185 --> 00:19:52.185 align:middle line:90%
this film is presenting.

00:19:52.185 --> 00:19:52.700 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:19:52.700 --> 00:19:54.700 align:middle line:84%
>>DYER: And it's 1987
and it's telling us--

00:19:54.700 --> 00:19:57.120 align:middle line:84%
and you're talking about
"Manchurian Candidate," that's

00:19:57.120 --> 00:19:58.270 align:middle line:90%
late 50s, right?

00:19:58.270 --> 00:20:00.520 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Well, then they
had a remake a few years ago

00:20:00.520 --> 00:20:01.520 align:middle line:90%
with Liev Schreiber.

00:20:01.520 --> 00:20:02.685 align:middle line:90%
>>DYER: With Denzel, right.

00:20:02.685 --> 00:20:04.060 align:middle line:84%
And what I liked
about the remake

00:20:04.060 --> 00:20:06.141 align:middle line:84%
was that they transferred
it from being a state

00:20:06.141 --> 00:20:08.140 align:middle line:84%
thing to more of a corporate
thing where they're

00:20:08.140 --> 00:20:10.090 align:middle line:84%
going to assassinate the
president with these trigger

00:20:10.090 --> 00:20:10.960 align:middle line:90%
words and keywords.

00:20:10.960 --> 00:20:15.040 align:middle line:84%
And actually when you read
about Project BLUEBIRD, Project

00:20:15.040 --> 00:20:18.222 align:middle line:84%
ARTICHOKE, that's really what
they were experimenting with.

00:20:18.222 --> 00:20:19.930 align:middle line:84%
One of the other
doctors I didn't mention

00:20:19.930 --> 00:20:22.000 align:middle line:90%
was Dr. Estabrooks.

00:20:22.000 --> 00:20:25.480 align:middle line:90%
And his specialty was hypnosis.

00:20:25.480 --> 00:20:28.820 align:middle line:10%
And if you go to the DSMV-4,
which is the diagnostics--

00:20:28.820 --> 00:20:31.930 align:middle line:10%
and this is year 5, whatever
version they're on, right--

00:20:31.930 --> 00:20:35.350 align:middle line:10%
they still cite his hypnosis
article in the DSMV.

00:20:35.350 --> 00:20:38.340 align:middle line:10%
So you can find where he talked
about in his hypnosis article--

00:20:38.340 --> 00:20:42.790 align:middle line:10%
it's a famous 1973 or '76 piece
written in The New Scientist.

00:20:42.790 --> 00:20:45.460 align:middle line:10%
And it was talking about
how during wartime they

00:20:45.460 --> 00:20:49.000 align:middle line:10%
could actually use couriers and
have trigger words that they

00:20:49.000 --> 00:20:52.240 align:middle line:10%
could relay information in
alternate personalities.

00:20:52.240 --> 00:20:55.725 align:middle line:84%
So I think that the CIA has
worked on that for decades.

00:20:55.725 --> 00:20:57.520 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And they
use sometimes some

00:20:57.520 --> 00:20:59.500 align:middle line:84%
of the most
beautiful technology.

00:20:59.500 --> 00:21:03.220 align:middle line:84%
Patrick Flanagan told me
that his neurophone, which

00:21:03.220 --> 00:21:06.940 align:middle line:84%
was confiscated from
him, which was used

00:21:06.940 --> 00:21:09.160 align:middle line:84%
to be able to
essentially speed up

00:21:09.160 --> 00:21:12.400 align:middle line:84%
the synaptic connections between
right and left hemispheres

00:21:12.400 --> 00:21:15.760 align:middle line:84%
and enhance your
ability to function.

00:21:15.760 --> 00:21:18.070 align:middle line:84%
I used it in a time
when I really needed it.

00:21:18.070 --> 00:21:19.525 align:middle line:90%
It's a phenomenal technology.

00:21:19.525 --> 00:21:21.050 align:middle line:90%
It was taken away.

00:21:21.050 --> 00:21:23.554 align:middle line:84%
And he told me privately that
the government was using it

00:21:23.554 --> 00:21:24.720 align:middle line:90%
for these kinds of projects.

00:21:24.720 --> 00:21:26.710 align:middle line:84%
>>DYER: Yeah, Jose
Delgado wrote a book back

00:21:26.710 --> 00:21:28.900 align:middle line:84%
in the '60s called "Physical
Control of the Mind."

00:21:28.900 --> 00:21:29.260 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:21:29.260 --> 00:21:30.710 align:middle line:84%
>>DYER: And he was dealing
with those very topics.

00:21:30.710 --> 00:21:32.070 align:middle line:90%
So this is absolutely real.

00:21:32.070 --> 00:21:34.840 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Yes, and
the other thing

00:21:34.840 --> 00:21:39.220 align:middle line:84%
is the notion that, when
I was watching the film,

00:21:39.220 --> 00:21:42.430 align:middle line:84%
I thought, this is a few years
later, this is "Wag the Dog,"

00:21:42.430 --> 00:21:43.570 align:middle line:90%
right?

00:21:43.570 --> 00:21:46.390 align:middle line:84%
And so that whole
scenario of creating

00:21:46.390 --> 00:21:48.130 align:middle line:84%
a fictionalized
version of reality

00:21:48.130 --> 00:21:50.290 align:middle line:84%
and then repeating it,
repeating it, repeating it,

00:21:50.290 --> 00:21:53.390 align:middle line:84%
until it becomes the fabric
of our collective reality

00:21:53.390 --> 00:21:54.190 align:middle line:90%
and memory.

00:21:54.190 --> 00:21:57.366 align:middle line:84%
>>DYER: Yeah, it's interesting
because Robert De Niro

00:21:57.366 --> 00:21:59.500 align:middle line:84%
is playing a character
who's loosely based on

00:21:59.500 --> 00:22:01.570 align:middle line:84%
what actually exists
in terms of a liaison

00:22:01.570 --> 00:22:03.370 align:middle line:84%
office between the
CIA and Hollywood.

00:22:03.370 --> 00:22:03.790 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:22:03.790 --> 00:22:05.800 align:middle line:84%
>>DYER: And so the
character that he's playing

00:22:05.800 --> 00:22:10.450 align:middle line:84%
is this guy who goes and he
hires a big time producer

00:22:10.450 --> 00:22:14.080 align:middle line:84%
in the film to stage a
war scene to distract

00:22:14.080 --> 00:22:17.830 align:middle line:84%
from a presidential scandal
that involved this girl,

00:22:17.830 --> 00:22:18.980 align:middle line:90%
and she's wearing a beret.

00:22:18.980 --> 00:22:20.710 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Sound familiar?

00:22:20.710 --> 00:22:22.780 align:middle line:84%
>>DYER: A girl
scout outfit, which

00:22:22.780 --> 00:22:24.850 align:middle line:90%
is you can look at the date.

00:22:24.850 --> 00:22:27.490 align:middle line:84%
It was actually a few
months prior to the release

00:22:27.490 --> 00:22:29.440 align:middle line:90%
of the Monica Lewinsky scandal.

00:22:29.440 --> 00:22:34.420 align:middle line:84%
So there is, I think,
clear continuity of what

00:22:34.420 --> 00:22:38.150 align:middle line:84%
I call a continuity of agenda
or predictive programming

00:22:38.150 --> 00:22:38.950 align:middle line:90%
planning in that.

00:22:38.950 --> 00:22:40.120 align:middle line:84%
There's no other
way that they could

00:22:40.120 --> 00:22:41.770 align:middle line:84%
have known that because
Monica Lewinsky comes out

00:22:41.770 --> 00:22:42.670 align:middle line:90%
wearing this beret, right?

00:22:42.670 --> 00:22:43.470 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:22:43.470 --> 00:22:44.740 align:middle line:90%
>>DYER: In the photos of her.

00:22:44.740 --> 00:22:49.960 align:middle line:10%
And the purpose of the
deflection was to--

00:22:49.960 --> 00:22:51.925 align:middle line:10%
well it served
many uses, but what

00:22:51.925 --> 00:22:53.800 align:middle line:10%
a lot of people who talk
about this film miss

00:22:53.800 --> 00:22:57.416 align:middle line:10%
is that there's a meeting
between the producer

00:22:57.416 --> 00:22:58.540 align:middle line:10%
and some of the CIA people.

00:22:58.540 --> 00:23:00.940 align:middle line:10%
And they talk about
the fact that it's now

00:23:00.940 --> 00:23:03.710 align:middle line:10%
going to shift out of these
older conflicts of the '90s,

00:23:03.710 --> 00:23:04.510 align:middle line:10%
like the Balkans.

00:23:04.510 --> 00:23:08.866 align:middle line:10%
And that's where they
create this fake war with--

00:23:08.866 --> 00:23:10.240 align:middle line:10%
it's actually
Kirsten Dunst who's

00:23:10.240 --> 00:23:13.370 align:middle line:10%
playing the little girl
who's the Albanian girl who's

00:23:13.370 --> 00:23:14.810 align:middle line:10%
got a bag of Tostitos.

00:23:14.810 --> 00:23:16.460 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Like she
looks Albanian.

00:23:16.460 --> 00:23:18.460 align:middle line:84%
>>DYER: And they photoshopped
in a kitty, right.

00:23:18.460 --> 00:23:19.501 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right, exactly.

00:23:19.501 --> 00:23:22.120 align:middle line:90%
>>DYER: So this was a fake war.

00:23:22.120 --> 00:23:24.047 align:middle line:84%
And the purpose of
that is to shift,

00:23:24.047 --> 00:23:26.255 align:middle line:84%
as they say, out of the
Balkans into a war on terror.

00:23:26.255 --> 00:23:26.720 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:23:26.720 --> 00:23:28.511 align:middle line:84%
>>DYER: And so this is
what we were getting

00:23:28.511 --> 00:23:30.040 align:middle line:84%
in the '90s as
preparation for 2001

00:23:30.040 --> 00:23:31.255 align:middle line:90%
and the global war on terror.

00:23:31.255 --> 00:23:33.130 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: We're going
to go to "Interstellar"

00:23:33.130 --> 00:23:37.210 align:middle line:84%
now, which has a lot of
beauty in it, in my opinion,

00:23:37.210 --> 00:23:40.360 align:middle line:84%
but also the whole notion
of potentially I guess,

00:23:40.360 --> 00:23:44.350 align:middle line:84%
you would say, lands
that have gone sour

00:23:44.350 --> 00:23:46.720 align:middle line:84%
and no longer are
able to produce foods.

00:23:46.720 --> 00:23:48.550 align:middle line:84%
And one would
speculate it has to do

00:23:48.550 --> 00:23:51.300 align:middle line:84%
with perhaps GMOs, chemtrails,
and everything else

00:23:51.300 --> 00:23:53.530 align:middle line:84%
that it's been
exposed to, right?

00:23:53.530 --> 00:23:56.530 align:middle line:84%
And I thought we'd go into
this little clip here.

00:23:56.530 --> 00:23:59.620 align:middle line:84%
Let's see here, it's
about an attempt

00:23:59.620 --> 00:24:02.756 align:middle line:84%
to find new places to
seed humanity, right?

00:24:02.756 --> 00:24:04.630 align:middle line:84%
OK, so before we even
start talking about it,

00:24:04.630 --> 00:24:06.129 align:middle line:84%
let's go into this
little film clip.

00:24:06.129 --> 00:24:09.370 align:middle line:84%
It's around 18 minutes and
15 seconds into the film, OK?

00:24:09.370 --> 00:24:14.290 align:middle line:90%


00:24:14.290 --> 00:24:16.750 align:middle line:10%
>> The ghost.

00:24:16.750 --> 00:24:20.501 align:middle line:10%
>> Grab your pillow
sleep in with Tom.

00:24:20.501 --> 00:24:22.250 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Give us an
overview of that film

00:24:22.250 --> 00:24:25.190 align:middle line:84%
because some people
found it kind of complex.

00:24:25.190 --> 00:24:29.821 align:middle line:84%
Same guy that did,
not "Interception."

00:24:29.821 --> 00:24:30.920 align:middle line:90%
>>DYER: Christopher Nolan.

00:24:30.920 --> 00:24:31.720 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:24:31.720 --> 00:24:32.553 align:middle line:90%
>>DYER: "Inception."

00:24:32.553 --> 00:24:34.280 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: "Inception,"
right, exactly.

00:24:34.280 --> 00:24:37.520 align:middle line:84%
So he tends to deal with
multi-dimensional and complex

00:24:37.520 --> 00:24:40.550 align:middle line:84%
themes, dreams within dreams,
realities upon reality.

00:24:40.550 --> 00:24:43.040 align:middle line:10%
>>DYER: Always Jungian
archetypes in Christopher Nolan

00:24:43.040 --> 00:24:44.667 align:middle line:10%
films, absolutely.

00:24:44.667 --> 00:24:45.500 align:middle line:10%
Even in the Batman--

00:24:45.500 --> 00:24:48.140 align:middle line:10%
"Dark Knight Rises,"
the whole series

00:24:48.140 --> 00:24:49.460 align:middle line:10%
is full of Jungian archetypes.

00:24:49.460 --> 00:24:52.910 align:middle line:84%
And I think what stands
out about "Interstellar"

00:24:52.910 --> 00:24:56.360 align:middle line:84%
is that it's his homage to
"2001: A Space Odyssey."

00:24:56.360 --> 00:24:59.030 align:middle line:84%
Now there's a little bit of
a difference with Kubrick's

00:24:59.030 --> 00:25:03.665 align:middle line:84%
theory and conclusion and the
conclusion that Nolan comes to.

00:25:03.665 --> 00:25:05.540 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So give us a
comparison of the two.

00:25:05.540 --> 00:25:07.910 align:middle line:84%
>>DYER: Right, well,
I think it would help

00:25:07.910 --> 00:25:09.370 align:middle line:90%
to understand "2001" first.

00:25:09.370 --> 00:25:10.170 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:25:10.170 --> 00:25:12.560 align:middle line:84%
>>DYER: So I'm sure
everybody has seen "2001."

00:25:12.560 --> 00:25:14.900 align:middle line:84%
Basically, my
analysis is that it

00:25:14.900 --> 00:25:19.740 align:middle line:84%
is a presentation of man
overcoming all limitations.

00:25:19.740 --> 00:25:21.560 align:middle line:84%
And when we think
of limitations,

00:25:21.560 --> 00:25:23.070 align:middle line:84%
I'm not talking about the
government or anything

00:25:23.070 --> 00:25:23.870 align:middle line:90%
like that.

00:25:23.870 --> 00:25:26.270 align:middle line:84%
I'm talking about actual
physical limitations.

00:25:26.270 --> 00:25:32.480 align:middle line:84%
So in our dimension, we can
speak of it as time and space.

00:25:32.480 --> 00:25:34.940 align:middle line:84%
And time and space, you're
limited in the directions

00:25:34.940 --> 00:25:35.884 align:middle line:90%
that you can go.

00:25:35.884 --> 00:25:37.800 align:middle line:84%
And this goes back to
ancient Greek philosophy

00:25:37.800 --> 00:25:38.990 align:middle line:90%
and Pythagoreanism.

00:25:38.990 --> 00:25:41.030 align:middle line:84%
So the way that they
would conceive geometry

00:25:41.030 --> 00:25:43.040 align:middle line:84%
is that you can only
go in six directions--

00:25:43.040 --> 00:25:44.630 align:middle line:84%
this way, this way, this
way, this way, this way,

00:25:44.630 --> 00:25:45.050 align:middle line:90%
and this way.

00:25:45.050 --> 00:25:45.850 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:25:45.850 --> 00:25:47.230 align:middle line:90%
>>DYER: Now that is a cube.

00:25:47.230 --> 00:25:48.030 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:25:48.030 --> 00:25:50.450 align:middle line:84%
>>DYER: So this dimension
is literally pictured

00:25:50.450 --> 00:25:51.784 align:middle line:90%
in the Platonic solid as a cube.

00:25:51.784 --> 00:25:52.583 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:25:52.583 --> 00:25:53.409 align:middle line:90%
>>DYER: All right.

00:25:53.409 --> 00:25:55.950 align:middle line:84%
This will get into the Saturn
stuff that we talk about later.

00:25:55.950 --> 00:25:59.210 align:middle line:84%
So what Kubrick is talking
about with that monolith,

00:25:59.210 --> 00:26:02.120 align:middle line:84%
it's still a cube, is
that I believe it's

00:26:02.120 --> 00:26:03.951 align:middle line:90%
a sort of advanced AI itself.

00:26:03.951 --> 00:26:05.450 align:middle line:84%
And that's what has
been leading man

00:26:05.450 --> 00:26:09.740 align:middle line:84%
all along through these stages
of new eons of consciousness,

00:26:09.740 --> 00:26:12.340 align:middle line:84%
this evolutionary process, the
ascent of man, or apotheosis.

00:26:12.340 --> 00:26:17.690 align:middle line:84%
Now, what Kubrick
proposes is that man

00:26:17.690 --> 00:26:22.910 align:middle line:84%
has to fight AI in
overcoming it to achieve

00:26:22.910 --> 00:26:27.650 align:middle line:84%
the status of divinity,
deification, star child.

00:26:27.650 --> 00:26:29.510 align:middle line:84%
So there's this
battle that happens.

00:26:29.510 --> 00:26:32.392 align:middle line:84%
Now in Nolan's presentation
of "Interstellar,"

00:26:32.392 --> 00:26:33.350 align:middle line:90%
it's an homage to that.

00:26:33.350 --> 00:26:35.900 align:middle line:84%
But he differs a
little bit by saying we

00:26:35.900 --> 00:26:37.610 align:middle line:90%
don't have to have this battle.

00:26:37.610 --> 00:26:40.970 align:middle line:84%
What if AI is actually
a means by which we

00:26:40.970 --> 00:26:44.640 align:middle line:84%
could achieve the improvement
of humanity in a good way?

00:26:44.640 --> 00:26:47.480 align:middle line:84%
So I think he's trying to make
a statement that transhumanism,

00:26:47.480 --> 00:26:49.312 align:middle line:84%
AI, these things,
don't have to be bad.

00:26:49.312 --> 00:26:51.770 align:middle line:84%
There's nothing inherently bad
about technology or anything

00:26:51.770 --> 00:26:52.160 align:middle line:90%
like that.

00:26:52.160 --> 00:26:53.390 align:middle line:84%
It could be used
for good, I think,

00:26:53.390 --> 00:26:54.725 align:middle line:90%
is what he's trying to say.

00:26:54.725 --> 00:26:56.780 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: It would
appear so, yes.

00:26:56.780 --> 00:26:59.836 align:middle line:84%
And this then makes me reflect
on "Battlestar Galactica,"

00:26:59.836 --> 00:27:01.460 align:middle line:84%
for anybody that
watched it all the way

00:27:01.460 --> 00:27:04.670 align:middle line:84%
to the end, which I
adored that series.

00:27:04.670 --> 00:27:07.340 align:middle line:90%
Again, chicken or egg.

00:27:07.340 --> 00:27:09.830 align:middle line:84%
>>DYER: Right, with the
Cylons and the-- yeah.

00:27:09.830 --> 00:27:10.630 align:middle line:90%
The cloning.

00:27:10.630 --> 00:27:13.280 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Yeah, the chicken
or egg in terms of AI,

00:27:13.280 --> 00:27:17.990 align:middle line:84%
because this AI has been in
existence for probably billions

00:27:17.990 --> 00:27:18.930 align:middle line:90%
of years--

00:27:18.930 --> 00:27:20.810 align:middle line:84%
millions, if not
billions of years.

00:27:20.810 --> 00:27:23.790 align:middle line:84%
Throughout the solar systems,
throughout the universes,

00:27:23.790 --> 00:27:25.690 align:middle line:84%
there are intelligent
civilizations

00:27:25.690 --> 00:27:26.884 align:middle line:90%
who've been using AI.

00:27:26.884 --> 00:27:28.550 align:middle line:84%
And who knows to what
degree it was even

00:27:28.550 --> 00:27:30.590 align:middle line:84%
used on our planet
in the early days?

00:27:30.590 --> 00:27:32.180 align:middle line:84%
>>DYER: I think
that is definitely

00:27:32.180 --> 00:27:34.005 align:middle line:84%
Kubrick's presentation
in "2001."

00:27:34.005 --> 00:27:36.380 align:middle line:84%
And I think you have to watch
it several times before you

00:27:36.380 --> 00:27:37.790 align:middle line:90%
get that idea.

00:27:37.790 --> 00:27:39.500 align:middle line:84%
But it also helps
if you go and look

00:27:39.500 --> 00:27:42.410 align:middle line:84%
at his co-creator, Arthur
C. Clark's other books

00:27:42.410 --> 00:27:44.450 align:middle line:90%
in that series, "3001."

00:27:44.450 --> 00:27:47.620 align:middle line:84%
The two come together, HAL
and Bowman, to form Halman.

00:27:47.620 --> 00:27:49.420 align:middle line:84%
So there's this merger
between the two,

00:27:49.420 --> 00:27:54.590 align:middle line:84%
and they become this
quasi-divine deified figure

00:27:54.590 --> 00:27:57.795 align:middle line:84%
that can traverse the universe
in some sort of chariot,

00:27:57.795 --> 00:27:58.670 align:middle line:90%
like a robot chariot.

00:27:58.670 --> 00:28:00.860 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And everybody falls
on one side or the other

00:28:00.860 --> 00:28:02.026 align:middle line:90%
of how they feel about that.

00:28:02.026 --> 00:28:04.730 align:middle line:84%
>>DYER: I think that's
where Nolan comes in to say,

00:28:04.730 --> 00:28:07.280 align:middle line:84%
what if AI could
be used for good.

00:28:07.280 --> 00:28:13.520 align:middle line:84%
And what if it's a
participant in man's procedure

00:28:13.520 --> 00:28:15.620 align:middle line:84%
alongst this alchemical
path that he's

00:28:15.620 --> 00:28:17.360 align:middle line:90%
on throughout all of time.

00:28:17.360 --> 00:28:18.860 align:middle line:84%
I think that's what
Nolan is saying.

00:28:18.860 --> 00:28:20.420 align:middle line:84%
And that's why in
the end of the film

00:28:20.420 --> 00:28:21.980 align:middle line:84%
you see, just like
in "2001," it's

00:28:21.980 --> 00:28:25.970 align:middle line:84%
both the monolith and Bowman
that go into the Stargate.

00:28:25.970 --> 00:28:31.010 align:middle line:84%
At the end of "Interstellar,"
the Matthew McConaughey

00:28:31.010 --> 00:28:34.790 align:middle line:84%
character-- he flies
Lincoln into space,

00:28:34.790 --> 00:28:37.310 align:middle line:84%
I've got to do my Matthew
McConaughey impersonation--

00:28:37.310 --> 00:28:39.440 align:middle line:84%
they both, him and the
robot, both participate

00:28:39.440 --> 00:28:42.260 align:middle line:84%
in the stargate and they
both together achieve

00:28:42.260 --> 00:28:47.060 align:middle line:84%
this transcending of the
time and space limitations

00:28:47.060 --> 00:28:49.340 align:middle line:84%
through what's
called a tesseract.

00:28:49.340 --> 00:28:51.020 align:middle line:84%
That's a real
geometrical figure,

00:28:51.020 --> 00:28:52.400 align:middle line:90%
and it's proven mathematically.

00:28:52.400 --> 00:28:53.734 align:middle line:90%
A lot of people don't know that.

00:28:53.734 --> 00:28:55.275 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Well, and
it's interesting,

00:28:55.275 --> 00:28:57.600 align:middle line:84%
as we get to the end of this
part of the conversation,

00:28:57.600 --> 00:28:59.840 align:middle line:84%
there's something
that trumps AI.

00:28:59.840 --> 00:29:01.700 align:middle line:84%
And that's what is the
most beautiful thing

00:29:01.700 --> 00:29:04.450 align:middle line:84%
about this story when I said
I found a lot of beauty in it.

00:29:04.450 --> 00:29:07.660 align:middle line:84%
But meanwhile, one of the
scenes in there, people

00:29:07.660 --> 00:29:10.200 align:middle line:84%
will watch that and say, now
why was that placed there.

00:29:10.200 --> 00:29:13.490 align:middle line:84%
And it's an academic environment
where they're saying,

00:29:13.490 --> 00:29:16.880 align:middle line:84%
well, you know we revised
history on the moon landing,

00:29:16.880 --> 00:29:17.780 align:middle line:90%
you know that, right?

00:29:17.780 --> 00:29:20.240 align:middle line:84%
I mean, that's been
revised to the real story.

00:29:20.240 --> 00:29:21.710 align:middle line:90%
Let's take a look at that clip.

00:29:21.710 --> 00:29:24.017 align:middle line:10%
>> She always
loved the pictures.

00:29:24.017 --> 00:29:25.350 align:middle line:10%
>> It's an old federal textbook.

00:29:25.350 --> 00:29:28.160 align:middle line:10%
We've replaced them with
the corrected versions.

00:29:28.160 --> 00:29:29.350 align:middle line:10%
>> Corrected?

00:29:29.350 --> 00:29:31.850 align:middle line:10%
>> Explaining how the Apollo
missions were faked to bankrupt

00:29:31.850 --> 00:29:33.035 align:middle line:10%
the Soviet Union.

00:29:33.035 --> 00:29:35.519 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So why was that
included in the story?

00:29:35.519 --> 00:29:36.560 align:middle line:90%
>>DYER: It's interesting.

00:29:36.560 --> 00:29:38.997 align:middle line:84%
I think that there is a
term that you've probably

00:29:38.997 --> 00:29:40.580 align:middle line:84%
heard called Revelation
of the Method.

00:29:40.580 --> 00:29:43.700 align:middle line:84%
And I think it's about how
you reveal what you're doing.

00:29:43.700 --> 00:29:45.680 align:middle line:84%
And that itself as a
revelation can actually

00:29:45.680 --> 00:29:47.480 align:middle line:84%
be a form of
psychological warfare.

00:29:47.480 --> 00:29:50.090 align:middle line:84%
Now it sounds counterintuitive
because why would you

00:29:50.090 --> 00:29:51.550 align:middle line:90%
reveal what you're doing.

00:29:51.550 --> 00:29:53.930 align:middle line:84%
Now if you look at
psychology, there's

00:29:53.930 --> 00:29:55.370 align:middle line:90%
a technique called gaslighting.

00:29:55.370 --> 00:29:58.420 align:middle line:84%
And you can gaslight
somebody by telling them,

00:29:58.420 --> 00:30:01.724 align:middle line:84%
even in the midst of the
act, that you're not doing

00:30:01.724 --> 00:30:02.890 align:middle line:90%
the very thing you're doing.

00:30:02.890 --> 00:30:03.170 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:30:03.170 --> 00:30:04.540 align:middle line:84%
>>DYER: So sometimes
criminals will do this.

00:30:04.540 --> 00:30:06.030 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Creating this
cognitive dissonance.

00:30:06.030 --> 00:30:07.070 align:middle line:90%
>>DYER: Yes, exactly.

00:30:07.070 --> 00:30:10.010 align:middle line:84%
Robbers might be like,
you're holding the purse,

00:30:10.010 --> 00:30:11.945 align:middle line:84%
I didn't rob you,
this is my purse.

00:30:11.945 --> 00:30:14.450 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And you're totally
confused and stunned.

00:30:14.450 --> 00:30:17.750 align:middle line:84%
>>DYER: Yeah, there was a
great movie in the late '40s,

00:30:17.750 --> 00:30:20.330 align:middle line:90%
I think, called "Gaslight."

00:30:20.330 --> 00:30:21.290 align:middle line:90%
You have to see it.

00:30:21.290 --> 00:30:22.190 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: I've never
seen it, "Gaslight."

00:30:22.190 --> 00:30:24.210 align:middle line:84%
>>DYER: It's a great
film, George Cukor film.

00:30:24.210 --> 00:30:25.010 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: OK, yes.

00:30:25.010 --> 00:30:26.343 align:middle line:90%
>>DYER: So check out "Gaslight."

00:30:26.343 --> 00:30:28.711 align:middle line:84%
But the idea of
Revelation of the Method,

00:30:28.711 --> 00:30:30.710 align:middle line:84%
of telling what you're
actually doing in a film,

00:30:30.710 --> 00:30:32.270 align:middle line:90%
is a principle of gaslighting.

00:30:32.270 --> 00:30:35.210 align:middle line:84%
It's a principle of
psychological warfare.

00:30:35.210 --> 00:30:38.930 align:middle line:84%
So I think that you can
sometimes throw clues

00:30:38.930 --> 00:30:40.661 align:middle line:90%
out there, little red herrings.

00:30:40.661 --> 00:30:42.410 align:middle line:84%
And people will go
down trails and they'll

00:30:42.410 --> 00:30:43.520 align:middle line:90%
get confused and lost.

00:30:43.520 --> 00:30:45.110 align:middle line:90%
That's another technique.

00:30:45.110 --> 00:30:48.560 align:middle line:84%
And so I think that this section
about the film or the moon

00:30:48.560 --> 00:30:50.570 align:middle line:84%
landings being fake
was in there on purpose

00:30:50.570 --> 00:30:51.710 align:middle line:90%
as a kind of deflection.

00:30:51.710 --> 00:30:52.710 align:middle line:90%
That's my opinion on it.

00:30:52.710 --> 00:30:54.290 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: OK, interesting.

00:30:54.290 --> 00:30:55.970 align:middle line:84%
Now we go into the
notion of, well,

00:30:55.970 --> 00:30:58.610 align:middle line:84%
like GAIA has their Deep
Space series, right.

00:30:58.610 --> 00:31:00.680 align:middle line:84%
Going into the Secret
Space Program--

00:31:00.680 --> 00:31:02.388 align:middle line:84%
the space program--
and they address this

00:31:02.388 --> 00:31:03.470 align:middle line:90%
and it never ended.

00:31:03.470 --> 00:31:06.950 align:middle line:84%
But it exists for an entirely
different purpose now,

00:31:06.950 --> 00:31:08.750 align:middle line:84%
which is the reseeding
of humanity, right?

00:31:08.750 --> 00:31:09.916 align:middle line:90%
>>DYER: I think so.

00:31:09.916 --> 00:31:12.290 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So let's go let's
go ahead and talk about that.

00:31:12.290 --> 00:31:13.706 align:middle line:84%
>>DYER: Well, that
is in the film.

00:31:13.706 --> 00:31:15.470 align:middle line:84%
A big part of this
movie is the idea

00:31:15.470 --> 00:31:17.840 align:middle line:84%
that Earth is no
longer inhabitable.

00:31:17.840 --> 00:31:21.230 align:middle line:84%
And through whatever means
of destruction, through GMOs

00:31:21.230 --> 00:31:23.210 align:middle line:84%
or geoengineering,
or whatever, we've

00:31:23.210 --> 00:31:27.440 align:middle line:84%
got to look for another way
to continue the human race.

00:31:27.440 --> 00:31:31.760 align:middle line:84%
But what this actually means
in the film's narrative is

00:31:31.760 --> 00:31:33.950 align:middle line:84%
a group of elites
basically, the secret space

00:31:33.950 --> 00:31:35.865 align:middle line:84%
program, the secret
NASA, they're

00:31:35.865 --> 00:31:37.490 align:middle line:84%
the ones that are
going to continue on.

00:31:37.490 --> 00:31:39.110 align:middle line:84%
And believe or
not, this is really

00:31:39.110 --> 00:31:42.950 align:middle line:84%
a repeat of the 1970s film
based on the '50s novel

00:31:42.950 --> 00:31:44.510 align:middle line:90%
from Ian Fleming's "Moonraker."

00:31:44.510 --> 00:31:46.051 align:middle line:84%
That's the exact
plot of "Moonraker,"

00:31:46.051 --> 00:31:49.384 align:middle line:84%
is that they want to seek to
reseed the Earth in that film.

00:31:49.384 --> 00:31:51.050 align:middle line:84%
It doesn't have to
be on another planet.

00:31:51.050 --> 00:31:53.172 align:middle line:84%
But in that film, it's
reseeding the Earth

00:31:53.172 --> 00:31:54.880 align:middle line:84%
and wiping out the
rest of the population

00:31:54.880 --> 00:31:59.450 align:middle line:84%
through depopulation and
basically biological warfare.

00:31:59.450 --> 00:32:04.100 align:middle line:84%
So the best that I can make
out of what this secret space

00:32:04.100 --> 00:32:07.910 align:middle line:84%
program is is really, again,
the fact that it also has

00:32:07.910 --> 00:32:09.230 align:middle line:90%
to deal with underground bases.

00:32:09.230 --> 00:32:11.400 align:middle line:84%
And I've done a lot
of research on that.

00:32:11.400 --> 00:32:14.330 align:middle line:84%
So it's not just the
space-out-there program,

00:32:14.330 --> 00:32:17.540 align:middle line:84%
it's also just like we said
with "2001," it's space

00:32:17.540 --> 00:32:19.860 align:middle line:84%
itself being given to
a privileged elite.

00:32:19.860 --> 00:32:22.211 align:middle line:84%
And the rest of us, this
is not your space anymore.

00:32:22.211 --> 00:32:23.210 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: No, not yours.

00:32:23.210 --> 00:32:25.640 align:middle line:84%
I had a dream
almost 20 years ago.

00:32:25.640 --> 00:32:26.450 align:middle line:90%
It was in '99.

00:32:26.450 --> 00:32:28.820 align:middle line:84%
I had a dream, it
was incredible.

00:32:28.820 --> 00:32:32.270 align:middle line:84%
It was a natural
kind of phenomena

00:32:32.270 --> 00:32:34.940 align:middle line:84%
that was taking place, roiling
through the sky, black,

00:32:34.940 --> 00:32:36.350 align:middle line:90%
roiling through the sky.

00:32:36.350 --> 00:32:38.210 align:middle line:90%
And people were in a panic.

00:32:38.210 --> 00:32:41.480 align:middle line:84%
And it is really profound
in the end of this dream.

00:32:41.480 --> 00:32:43.130 align:middle line:84%
And I was just
walking in the streets

00:32:43.130 --> 00:32:45.890 align:middle line:84%
looking at the different panic
and what people were choosing

00:32:45.890 --> 00:32:48.770 align:middle line:84%
to protect, how they were
choosing to exclude each other

00:32:48.770 --> 00:32:51.440 align:middle line:84%
and only protect themselves
and keep others away

00:32:51.440 --> 00:32:54.530 align:middle line:84%
from any kind of benefit
in this situation.

00:32:54.530 --> 00:32:56.990 align:middle line:84%
And toward the end, I go
into this beautiful circular

00:32:56.990 --> 00:32:58.490 align:middle line:90%
building.

00:32:58.490 --> 00:33:00.980 align:middle line:84%
It was a reflective
circular building,

00:33:00.980 --> 00:33:02.780 align:middle line:90%
like a donut from above.

00:33:02.780 --> 00:33:08.870 align:middle line:84%
And people of all ilks lived
there, all races, ethnicities.

00:33:08.870 --> 00:33:13.260 align:middle line:84%
There was no bias of any kind,
socioeconomically as well.

00:33:13.260 --> 00:33:15.120 align:middle line:84%
And they had a higher
understanding of life.

00:33:15.120 --> 00:33:17.460 align:middle line:84%
And this is my hero
part of the dream.

00:33:17.460 --> 00:33:21.450 align:middle line:84%
I'm standing on this grassy
knoll and I'm telling them,

00:33:21.450 --> 00:33:24.210 align:middle line:84%
there's only one thing that
matters now-- and that is love.

00:33:24.210 --> 00:33:26.370 align:middle line:84%
You have only time
to do one thing.

00:33:26.370 --> 00:33:29.510 align:middle line:84%
Forget the burdens
and project love into

00:33:29.510 --> 00:33:30.810 align:middle line:90%
and where you can now.

00:33:30.810 --> 00:33:33.420 align:middle line:84%
And meanwhile, a black
limousine pulls up

00:33:33.420 --> 00:33:37.920 align:middle line:84%
and both President Nixon
and President Clinton

00:33:37.920 --> 00:33:40.020 align:middle line:90%
get out of the same limousine.

00:33:40.020 --> 00:33:45.660 align:middle line:84%
And telepathically, Nixon
is saying to the people,

00:33:45.660 --> 00:33:47.220 align:middle line:90%
she's right you know.

00:33:47.220 --> 00:33:50.130 align:middle line:84%
And Clinton telepathically
projects to me,

00:33:50.130 --> 00:33:52.530 align:middle line:84%
I wish you could come
where we're going,

00:33:52.530 --> 00:33:54.390 align:middle line:84%
we're going to be
taking care of.

00:33:54.390 --> 00:33:58.020 align:middle line:84%
And I telepathically said,
you chose this path in life,

00:33:58.020 --> 00:33:59.929 align:middle line:84%
I didn't, I'll stay
here with the people.

00:33:59.929 --> 00:34:02.220 align:middle line:84%
>>DYER: Are you sure it wasn't
Keanu Reeves and Patrick

00:34:02.220 --> 00:34:03.142 align:middle line:90%
Swayze wearing masks?

00:34:03.142 --> 00:34:04.100 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: No it wasn't.

00:34:04.100 --> 00:34:05.227 align:middle line:90%
>>DYER: That's a joke.

00:34:05.227 --> 00:34:07.310 align:middle line:84%
A sequence in "Point of
No Return," remember that?

00:34:07.310 --> 00:34:08.110 align:middle line:90%
I'm kidding.

00:34:08.110 --> 00:34:10.219 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And I mean, it
was a profound dream--

00:34:10.219 --> 00:34:12.669 align:middle line:84%
and they drove down underground
with this black limousine

00:34:12.669 --> 00:34:13.469 align:middle line:90%
into the Earth.

00:34:13.469 --> 00:34:15.780 align:middle line:84%
And this is before I knew
about the underground bases.

00:34:15.780 --> 00:34:17.154 align:middle line:84%
And then Phil
Schneider's stories

00:34:17.154 --> 00:34:19.386 align:middle line:90%
started emerging in all of this.

00:34:19.386 --> 00:34:20.969 align:middle line:84%
>>DYER: It's funny--
is that you don't

00:34:20.969 --> 00:34:25.260 align:middle line:84%
have to go to conspiracy
or whistleblowing sites

00:34:25.260 --> 00:34:27.630 align:middle line:84%
or researchers to find out
about underground bases.

00:34:27.630 --> 00:34:31.380 align:middle line:84%
There was an old book written
by James Bamford in 1983.

00:34:31.380 --> 00:34:34.272 align:middle line:84%
It's the first book on the NSA
called the "Puzzle Palace."

00:34:34.272 --> 00:34:36.480 align:middle line:84%
And there's a section in
that book where he describes

00:34:36.480 --> 00:34:37.620 align:middle line:90%
a giant underground base.

00:34:37.620 --> 00:34:40.239 align:middle line:10%
Now this is not a
conspiracy book.

00:34:40.239 --> 00:34:41.880 align:middle line:10%
This is an official--

00:34:41.880 --> 00:34:44.050 align:middle line:10%
he's worked with
major news, right?--

00:34:44.050 --> 00:34:46.940 align:middle line:10%
official guy's book about this.

00:34:46.940 --> 00:34:49.310 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: I interviewed
one of the engineers who

00:34:49.310 --> 00:34:52.070 align:middle line:84%
used to blow the tunnels,
seven miles a day

00:34:52.070 --> 00:34:53.320 align:middle line:90%
with that high-tech machinery.

00:34:53.320 --> 00:34:56.150 align:middle line:84%
And he just gave a
nice engineering chat.

00:34:56.150 --> 00:34:58.230 align:middle line:84%
It was just like
listening to any engineer

00:34:58.230 --> 00:34:59.970 align:middle line:90%
talk about their daily work.

00:34:59.970 --> 00:35:00.930 align:middle line:90%
This is the real deal.

00:35:00.930 --> 00:35:02.304 align:middle line:84%
>>DYER: I think
that you can find

00:35:02.304 --> 00:35:06.226 align:middle line:84%
a connection between the
Star Wars Defense Initiative,

00:35:06.226 --> 00:35:07.600 align:middle line:84%
which is what
Reagan started back

00:35:07.600 --> 00:35:10.790 align:middle line:84%
in the late '70s, early '80s,
which is believed to be berthed

00:35:10.790 --> 00:35:11.610 align:middle line:90%
at Bohemian Grove.

00:35:11.610 --> 00:35:14.520 align:middle line:84%
You can actually find annals
from Bohemian Grove where

00:35:14.520 --> 00:35:17.490 align:middle line:84%
Nixon and Reagan
are there talking

00:35:17.490 --> 00:35:19.270 align:middle line:90%
about the birth of the SDI.

00:35:19.270 --> 00:35:20.070 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:35:20.070 --> 00:35:22.920 align:middle line:84%
>>DYER: And this was the idea
of the weaponization of space

00:35:22.920 --> 00:35:24.040 align:middle line:90%
and the upper atmosphere.

00:35:24.040 --> 00:35:25.030 align:middle line:84%
And this would
include the things

00:35:25.030 --> 00:35:26.530 align:middle line:84%
that we're going
to talk about later

00:35:26.530 --> 00:35:29.820 align:middle line:84%
like VLF/ELF manipulation,
Tesla-style stuff.

00:35:29.820 --> 00:35:31.980 align:middle line:84%
All that's included
in the SDI plans.

00:35:31.980 --> 00:35:34.770 align:middle line:10%
This was also where
they'll martial

00:35:34.770 --> 00:35:38.340 align:middle line:10%
DARPA, which we know is the
Defense Advanced Research

00:35:38.340 --> 00:35:40.830 align:middle line:10%
Projects Agency,
which deals with a lot

00:35:40.830 --> 00:35:44.190 align:middle line:10%
of militarized, high-tech
stuff for weaponization.

00:35:44.190 --> 00:35:48.240 align:middle line:10%
So the satellite networks
according to the SDI documents,

00:35:48.240 --> 00:35:49.740 align:middle line:10%
even at that time
in the early '80s,

00:35:49.740 --> 00:35:51.630 align:middle line:10%
they were working
on the possibility

00:35:51.630 --> 00:35:53.740 align:middle line:10%
of artificial
intelligence or Skynet.

00:35:53.740 --> 00:35:54.540 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:35:54.540 --> 00:35:56.115 align:middle line:84%
>>DYER: That's what they talked
about in those documents.

00:35:56.115 --> 00:35:57.540 align:middle line:84%
And a lot of this
is declassified

00:35:57.540 --> 00:35:59.739 align:middle line:84%
because it's the early
'80s, nobody cares anymore.

00:35:59.739 --> 00:36:01.530 align:middle line:84%
But even then, they
were working on Skynet.

00:36:01.530 --> 00:36:03.570 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah, absolutely, ok.

00:36:03.570 --> 00:36:06.020 align:middle line:84%
So let's go into the
notion of time itself.

00:36:06.020 --> 00:36:08.350 align:middle line:84%
And you're talking
here about the occult

00:36:08.350 --> 00:36:11.100 align:middle line:84%
and hermetic traditions
that are featuring Saturn

00:36:11.100 --> 00:36:13.140 align:middle line:84%
and how Saturn comes
into this story,

00:36:13.140 --> 00:36:14.490 align:middle line:90%
because Saturn means time.

00:36:14.490 --> 00:36:16.680 align:middle line:84%
And the antagonist in
the story, as you just

00:36:16.680 --> 00:36:18.510 align:middle line:90%
mentioned a while ago, is time.

00:36:18.510 --> 00:36:20.100 align:middle line:84%
And there's a real
sadness about that

00:36:20.100 --> 00:36:21.224 align:middle line:90%
toward the end of the film.

00:36:21.224 --> 00:36:22.839 align:middle line:84%
>>DYER: Yeah, that's
a great point.

00:36:22.839 --> 00:36:24.630 align:middle line:84%
The part of the point
of the film, I think,

00:36:24.630 --> 00:36:29.190 align:middle line:84%
that's a great insight on the
part of Nolan and the writers

00:36:29.190 --> 00:36:34.560 align:middle line:84%
is that, even if you love
the idea of technology

00:36:34.560 --> 00:36:38.540 align:middle line:84%
and you're obsessed with that,
you're still always going

00:36:38.540 --> 00:36:41.040 align:middle line:84%
to be limited because technology
is only going to be dealing

00:36:41.040 --> 00:36:42.670 align:middle line:90%
with things in this sphere.

00:36:42.670 --> 00:36:43.470 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:36:43.470 --> 00:36:45.540 align:middle line:84%
>>DYER: And so if
you're obsessed

00:36:45.540 --> 00:36:48.240 align:middle line:84%
with that to the point of
materialism and all that,

00:36:48.240 --> 00:36:50.280 align:middle line:84%
reductionism as it's
called in philosophy,

00:36:50.280 --> 00:36:52.290 align:middle line:84%
then you're not open
to the possibility

00:36:52.290 --> 00:36:54.960 align:middle line:84%
of higher planes of existence,
higher realities, higher

00:36:54.960 --> 00:36:56.360 align:middle line:90%
dimensions.

00:36:56.360 --> 00:36:59.720 align:middle line:84%
And that's cutting you off to
the possibility of divine love,

00:36:59.720 --> 00:37:02.155 align:middle line:84%
higher love, because you're
obsessed with the material

00:37:02.155 --> 00:37:03.030 align:middle line:90%
and the here and now.

00:37:03.030 --> 00:37:03.830 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Exactly.

00:37:03.830 --> 00:37:08.400 align:middle line:10%
>>DYER: So time and space
are in a sense a limitation,

00:37:08.400 --> 00:37:10.890 align:middle line:10%
a kind of imprisonment,
that I believe is temporary.

00:37:10.890 --> 00:37:14.257 align:middle line:10%
I believe ultimately
we can transcend those.

00:37:14.257 --> 00:37:15.840 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And we
don't need technology

00:37:15.840 --> 00:37:16.798 align:middle line:90%
to do that, by the way.

00:37:16.798 --> 00:37:19.290 align:middle line:84%
>>DYER: No, but I'm just
saying that I don't think,

00:37:19.290 --> 00:37:21.510 align:middle line:84%
and like Nolan is saying,
it doesn't have to be bad.

00:37:21.510 --> 00:37:22.665 align:middle line:90%
It's all in how we use it.

00:37:22.665 --> 00:37:23.480 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Exactly.

00:37:23.480 --> 00:37:25.230 align:middle line:84%
>>DYER: And Nolan is
saying that the way

00:37:25.230 --> 00:37:28.600 align:middle line:84%
that you transcend that is
a higher level of reality,

00:37:28.600 --> 00:37:29.490 align:middle line:90%
which is love.

00:37:29.490 --> 00:37:31.560 align:middle line:84%
And I think that
divine love is real.

00:37:31.560 --> 00:37:35.100 align:middle line:84%
And that's what's reflected
in the love between Matthew

00:37:35.100 --> 00:37:37.810 align:middle line:84%
McConaughey's character and
his daughter in the film.

00:37:37.810 --> 00:37:40.035 align:middle line:84%
And that's how they speak
outside of time and space.

00:37:40.035 --> 00:37:42.160 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And that was the
beautiful element of it.

00:37:42.160 --> 00:37:44.010 align:middle line:84%
There are so many
beautiful elements

00:37:44.010 --> 00:37:46.860 align:middle line:84%
when the story started actually
coming together toward the end.

00:37:46.860 --> 00:37:49.860 align:middle line:84%
But another interesting
thing is that the males

00:37:49.860 --> 00:37:51.780 align:middle line:84%
in the film, all
the men in the film,

00:37:51.780 --> 00:37:56.010 align:middle line:84%
are beholden to the
dictates of technology

00:37:56.010 --> 00:37:58.920 align:middle line:84%
and the politics of the day,
including the elites lying

00:37:58.920 --> 00:38:06.210 align:middle line:84%
to their very own people
in the name of progression

00:38:06.210 --> 00:38:09.910 align:middle line:84%
of the species, saving the
race, technological advancement.

00:38:09.910 --> 00:38:13.540 align:middle line:84%
The women were the ones that
had the intuitive force to say,

00:38:13.540 --> 00:38:18.370 align:middle line:84%
I know where to go, I
know what matters here--

00:38:18.370 --> 00:38:20.159 align:middle line:84%
and Anne Hathaway,
in particular.

00:38:20.159 --> 00:38:22.450 align:middle line:84%
And I thought it would be
kind of cool to show this one

00:38:22.450 --> 00:38:25.957 align:middle line:84%
particular scene where Anne
Hathaway is talking about love,

00:38:25.957 --> 00:38:27.040 align:middle line:90%
because it comes up again.

00:38:27.040 --> 00:38:28.570 align:middle line:90%
Want to take a quick look?

00:38:28.570 --> 00:38:28.710 align:middle line:90%
>>DYER: All right.

00:38:28.710 --> 00:38:29.584 align:middle line:10%
>>REGINA: We'll look.

00:38:29.584 --> 00:38:32.710 align:middle line:10%
>> Love is the one thing we're
capable of perceiving that

00:38:32.710 --> 00:38:35.630 align:middle line:10%
transcends dimensions
of time and space.

00:38:35.630 --> 00:38:37.630 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Of course,
she's ignored.

00:38:37.630 --> 00:38:38.840 align:middle line:90%
The guys ignore her.

00:38:38.840 --> 00:38:41.020 align:middle line:84%
Nah, I think we should
go to this other place.

00:38:41.020 --> 00:38:42.489 align:middle line:90%
And she's saying, no.

00:38:42.489 --> 00:38:44.530 align:middle line:84%
And she's made this point
that there is something

00:38:44.530 --> 00:38:46.030 align:middle line:90%
that trumps all of this.

00:38:46.030 --> 00:38:48.160 align:middle line:84%
So anyway, continue
on there now.

00:38:48.160 --> 00:38:50.980 align:middle line:84%
Because now we're getting
into constructed realities

00:38:50.980 --> 00:38:54.360 align:middle line:84%
that someone else has created
from the fifth dimension

00:38:54.360 --> 00:38:57.880 align:middle line:84%
out where they are after
they pass through the hole.

00:38:57.880 --> 00:39:00.220 align:middle line:84%
And they've literally
collapsed time and space

00:39:00.220 --> 00:39:02.470 align:middle line:90%
so it doesn't pass anymore.

00:39:02.470 --> 00:39:06.250 align:middle line:84%
And now something,
someone else, has

00:39:06.250 --> 00:39:08.740 align:middle line:84%
created from another
dimension that they're

00:39:08.740 --> 00:39:12.590 align:middle line:84%
in a third dimensional appearing
reality to interface in.

00:39:12.590 --> 00:39:13.675 align:middle line:90%
Let's talk about that.

00:39:13.675 --> 00:39:15.250 align:middle line:84%
>>DYER: It's amazing
that you point that out

00:39:15.250 --> 00:39:16.210 align:middle line:84%
because I didn't
know what you were

00:39:16.210 --> 00:39:17.530 align:middle line:90%
going to talk about exactly.

00:39:17.530 --> 00:39:21.715 align:middle line:84%
And I just this week read a
book by an Eastern-minded guy.

00:39:21.715 --> 00:39:24.010 align:middle line:84%
He's a very famous theologian
of the last century.

00:39:24.010 --> 00:39:27.267 align:middle line:84%
He's now passed away, but his
name is Dumitru Staniloae.

00:39:27.267 --> 00:39:29.350 align:middle line:84%
And he wrote a really
fascinating deep, deep, deep

00:39:29.350 --> 00:39:31.270 align:middle line:84%
book called "The
Experience of God."

00:39:31.270 --> 00:39:33.400 align:middle line:84%
And in that book, he
talks about all the things

00:39:33.400 --> 00:39:34.441 align:middle line:90%
that we're talking about.

00:39:34.441 --> 00:39:37.750 align:middle line:84%
And he says that time and
space are a kind of limitation,

00:39:37.750 --> 00:39:38.920 align:middle line:90%
a kind of prison.

00:39:38.920 --> 00:39:42.970 align:middle line:84%
And he talks about the
obsession with left brain

00:39:42.970 --> 00:39:44.010 align:middle line:90%
analytical thinking.

00:39:44.010 --> 00:39:44.884 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Absolutely.

00:39:44.884 --> 00:39:46.964 align:middle line:84%
>>DYER: That cuts one
off from the other half

00:39:46.964 --> 00:39:48.130 align:middle line:90%
of what it is to be a human.

00:39:48.130 --> 00:39:51.010 align:middle line:10%
Now in this Eastern tradition
that I'm talking about,

00:39:51.010 --> 00:39:56.050 align:middle line:10%
going back to the Greeks,
he presents the anthropology

00:39:56.050 --> 00:39:58.700 align:middle line:10%
that man has a noose, which is
the eye of the mind for seeing

00:39:58.700 --> 00:39:59.500 align:middle line:10%
God.

00:39:59.500 --> 00:40:00.700 align:middle line:10%
There's a soul.

00:40:00.700 --> 00:40:01.830 align:middle line:10%
And then there's the heart.

00:40:01.830 --> 00:40:02.110 align:middle line:10%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:40:02.110 --> 00:40:04.237 align:middle line:10%
>>DYER: And these are
the inner aspects of man.

00:40:04.237 --> 00:40:05.570 align:middle line:10%
There's also the body of course.

00:40:05.570 --> 00:40:08.560 align:middle line:10%
But he argues that all
these have to be in harmony

00:40:08.560 --> 00:40:14.560 align:middle line:10%
and that you can't divide and
have only the rational thinking

00:40:14.560 --> 00:40:18.310 align:middle line:10%
or only the intuitive,
emotional connection.

00:40:18.310 --> 00:40:21.140 align:middle line:84%
You've got to have all of these
things working in harmony.

00:40:21.140 --> 00:40:23.515 align:middle line:84%
And I thought it was amazing
the way he talked about that

00:40:23.515 --> 00:40:25.412 align:middle line:90%
because he also linked to eons.

00:40:25.412 --> 00:40:27.370 align:middle line:84%
And this is the Greek
term-- we keep going back

00:40:27.370 --> 00:40:28.828 align:middle line:84%
to the Greeks and
philosophy-- this

00:40:28.828 --> 00:40:32.260 align:middle line:84%
is the Greek term for
large scale ages of time.

00:40:32.260 --> 00:40:35.270 align:middle line:84%
And I do think that there are
influences on these large scale

00:40:35.270 --> 00:40:36.070 align:middle line:90%
ages.

00:40:36.070 --> 00:40:39.085 align:middle line:84%
And there's a really fascinating
history of philosophy

00:40:39.085 --> 00:40:40.960 align:middle line:84%
that's called traditionalism
or perennialism.

00:40:40.960 --> 00:40:43.570 align:middle line:84%
And you could look at
writers like René Guénon,

00:40:43.570 --> 00:40:47.320 align:middle line:84%
and he talked about how our age
was this vast period that would

00:40:47.320 --> 00:40:49.550 align:middle line:84%
be shifting into what
he called Kali Yuga.

00:40:49.550 --> 00:40:50.350 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:40:50.350 --> 00:40:52.040 align:middle line:84%
>>DYER: And I'm sure
you've heard some of that.

00:40:52.040 --> 00:40:53.320 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: I'm
familiar with that.

00:40:53.320 --> 00:40:54.850 align:middle line:84%
>>DYER: René Guénon was
a great philosopher.

00:40:54.850 --> 00:40:56.590 align:middle line:84%
And his works are
very similar to what

00:40:56.590 --> 00:40:59.620 align:middle line:90%
Dumitru Staniloae wrote about--

00:40:59.620 --> 00:41:01.390 align:middle line:84%
I'm not used to
saying Romanian names.

00:41:01.390 --> 00:41:02.380 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Easy for you to say.

00:41:02.380 --> 00:41:03.629 align:middle line:90%
>>DYER: Romanian names, right.

00:41:03.629 --> 00:41:06.550 align:middle line:84%
But he talks about
how the eons are

00:41:06.550 --> 00:41:13.210 align:middle line:84%
things that are meant to
train us and lead us to God.

00:41:13.210 --> 00:41:14.950 align:middle line:84%
The time periods
in which we exist.

00:41:14.950 --> 00:41:16.590 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Which coincides
with the Yugas, yeah.

00:41:16.590 --> 00:41:17.760 align:middle line:84%
>>DYER: They're
learning periods.

00:41:17.760 --> 00:41:18.635 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah, yeah.

00:41:18.635 --> 00:41:21.130 align:middle line:84%
>>DYER: And so they're
intended to direct us

00:41:21.130 --> 00:41:24.599 align:middle line:84%
beyond the here and the now
and the material and atomism

00:41:24.599 --> 00:41:26.140 align:middle line:84%
and these different
philosophies that

00:41:26.140 --> 00:41:27.973 align:middle line:84%
have come to dominate
Western thought, which

00:41:27.973 --> 00:41:30.191 align:middle line:90%
I think are disastrous.

00:41:30.191 --> 00:41:31.690 align:middle line:84%
I think that they're
a real tragedy.

00:41:31.690 --> 00:41:34.480 align:middle line:84%
Because now we live in an
era in which we can only

00:41:34.480 --> 00:41:36.250 align:middle line:90%
view man as a biological robot.

00:41:36.250 --> 00:41:37.125 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Absolutely.

00:41:37.125 --> 00:41:39.800 align:middle line:84%
>>DYER: And believe it or not,
that is going to play into--

00:41:39.800 --> 00:41:41.800 align:middle line:84%
well, in my book, I talked
about "Blade Runner."

00:41:41.800 --> 00:41:42.920 align:middle line:84%
Now we're not going
to talk about that.

00:41:42.920 --> 00:41:45.160 align:middle line:84%
But one of the important
themes in "Blade Runner"

00:41:45.160 --> 00:41:49.520 align:middle line:84%
is that humans are
basically like robots.

00:41:49.520 --> 00:41:51.970 align:middle line:84%
And the robots, the
AI, are humanized.

00:41:51.970 --> 00:41:53.290 align:middle line:90%
So they're reversing that.

00:41:53.290 --> 00:41:55.240 align:middle line:10%
And that comes out
of MKULTRA, again,

00:41:55.240 --> 00:41:57.970 align:middle line:10%
because the
implantable electrode

00:41:57.970 --> 00:42:01.060 align:middle line:10%
that those doctors were working
on, that was part of MKULTRA.

00:42:01.060 --> 00:42:04.750 align:middle line:84%
So the whole transhumanist
movement is, believe it or not,

00:42:04.750 --> 00:42:06.686 align:middle line:84%
is a part of
MKULTRA, because it's

00:42:06.686 --> 00:42:07.810 align:middle line:90%
about programming the mind.

00:42:07.810 --> 00:42:10.090 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: You don't have
to convince me of that.

00:42:10.090 --> 00:42:12.100 align:middle line:90%
I'm on that page already.

00:42:12.100 --> 00:42:13.720 align:middle line:90%
I totally agree with that.

00:42:13.720 --> 00:42:17.590 align:middle line:84%
And I really don't like
seeing the glorification of it

00:42:17.590 --> 00:42:20.230 align:middle line:84%
as a result of that
because it's bypassing

00:42:20.230 --> 00:42:22.750 align:middle line:84%
some really critical elements
of our human development.

00:42:22.750 --> 00:42:23.550 align:middle line:90%
>>DYER: Exactly.

00:42:23.550 --> 00:42:26.200 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And trying to
artificially create results.

00:42:26.200 --> 00:42:28.930 align:middle line:84%
And if you start looking
into the individuals that

00:42:28.930 --> 00:42:31.480 align:middle line:84%
are really high up in the
AI movement, you'll see.

00:42:31.480 --> 00:42:34.150 align:middle line:84%
There is one thing, and I
don't use this term lightly,

00:42:34.150 --> 00:42:37.972 align:middle line:84%
but there's a deep
type of atheism.

00:42:37.972 --> 00:42:39.030 align:middle line:90%
>>DYER: Yes.

00:42:39.030 --> 00:42:41.860 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: That essentially
has no belief in anything

00:42:41.860 --> 00:42:43.555 align:middle line:90%
beyond the material realm.

00:42:43.555 --> 00:42:45.890 align:middle line:84%
Thus, you have to create
some kind of immortality

00:42:45.890 --> 00:42:46.690 align:middle line:90%
for yourself.

00:42:46.690 --> 00:42:47.320 align:middle line:90%
>>DYER: Exactly.

00:42:47.320 --> 00:42:48.653 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: It's based on atheism.

00:42:48.653 --> 00:42:50.890 align:middle line:84%
>>DYER: But it's
only an immortality

00:42:50.890 --> 00:42:52.115 align:middle line:90%
of temporal progression.

00:42:52.115 --> 00:42:52.915 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Exactly.

00:42:52.915 --> 00:42:55.540 align:middle line:84%
>>DYER: It's not an immortality
that experiences anything

00:42:55.540 --> 00:42:56.720 align:middle line:90%
beyond the here and now.

00:42:56.720 --> 00:42:57.520 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Exactly.

00:42:57.520 --> 00:42:59.830 align:middle line:84%
That's why I find it so
fascinating in Hollywood

00:42:59.830 --> 00:43:00.700 align:middle line:90%
that this thing keeps coming up.

00:43:00.700 --> 00:43:01.390 align:middle line:90%
>>DYER: And limiting.

00:43:01.390 --> 00:43:02.556 align:middle line:90%
That would be very limiting.

00:43:02.556 --> 00:43:04.010 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Oh,
incredibly limiting.

00:43:04.010 --> 00:43:06.580 align:middle line:84%
So now we come to
the point in the film

00:43:06.580 --> 00:43:10.150 align:middle line:84%
that Matthew
McConaughey gets it.

00:43:10.150 --> 00:43:13.854 align:middle line:10%
He's in this cube-type
structure dimension.

00:43:13.854 --> 00:43:14.770 align:middle line:10%
>>DYER: The tesseract.

00:43:14.770 --> 00:43:16.019 align:middle line:10%
>>REGINA: Yeah, the tesseract.

00:43:16.019 --> 00:43:20.230 align:middle line:10%
And this has been
created by other beings

00:43:20.230 --> 00:43:21.970 align:middle line:10%
in the fifth
dimension-- have created

00:43:21.970 --> 00:43:24.400 align:middle line:10%
this third dimensional form
for him to interface with

00:43:24.400 --> 00:43:25.750 align:middle line:10%
and his path of discovery.

00:43:25.750 --> 00:43:28.720 align:middle line:84%
Let's take a look at what
happens once he finds himself

00:43:28.720 --> 00:43:31.510 align:middle line:90%
locked in it with his daughter.

00:43:31.510 --> 00:43:33.449 align:middle line:90%
And time has collapsed now.

00:43:33.449 --> 00:43:35.490 align:middle line:84%
You're seeing his daughter
young as a young girl.

00:43:35.490 --> 00:43:38.560 align:middle line:84%
You're seeing her as a woman
on the other side, kind

00:43:38.560 --> 00:43:39.390 align:middle line:90%
of shadowy.

00:43:39.390 --> 00:43:42.400 align:middle line:10%
Let's see what happens here.

00:43:42.400 --> 00:43:45.160 align:middle line:10%
>> I brought myself here.

00:43:45.160 --> 00:43:48.790 align:middle line:10%
We're here to communicate with
the three-dimensional world.

00:43:48.790 --> 00:43:51.528 align:middle line:10%
We're the bridge.

00:43:51.528 --> 00:43:52.910 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: I love this.

00:43:52.910 --> 00:43:55.200 align:middle line:84%
As soon as this
happened, I thought,

00:43:55.200 --> 00:43:57.890 align:middle line:84%
bingo-- there's your answer,
transcends everything.

00:43:57.890 --> 00:44:01.190 align:middle line:84%
Love is the only thing that
can permeate and create

00:44:01.190 --> 00:44:04.420 align:middle line:84%
a resonance strong enough to
permeate dimensions, time,

00:44:04.420 --> 00:44:08.260 align:middle line:84%
space, and to collapse it
altogether into a reality.

00:44:08.260 --> 00:44:10.850 align:middle line:84%
>>DYER: What's amazing is that
for the people that you're

00:44:10.850 --> 00:44:13.850 align:middle line:84%
talking about, these atheistic,
materialistic-minded people,

00:44:13.850 --> 00:44:16.580 align:middle line:84%
the tesseract, or
a hypercube, this

00:44:16.580 --> 00:44:17.850 align:middle line:90%
is a real geometrical thing.

00:44:17.850 --> 00:44:19.290 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:44:19.290 --> 00:44:22.160 align:middle line:84%
>>DYER: It's proven
mathematically.

00:44:22.160 --> 00:44:23.150 align:middle line:90%
It's not speculative.

00:44:23.150 --> 00:44:25.649 align:middle line:84%
But the argument always goes
that, well, if we can't see it,

00:44:25.649 --> 00:44:26.940 align:middle line:90%
then it must not exist.

00:44:26.940 --> 00:44:29.300 align:middle line:84%
But this is a
geometrical form that

00:44:29.300 --> 00:44:31.370 align:middle line:90%
by definition can't be seen.

00:44:31.370 --> 00:44:33.880 align:middle line:84%
It can only be seen through
the imprinting of itself

00:44:33.880 --> 00:44:36.200 align:middle line:90%
self in 3-D reality.

00:44:36.200 --> 00:44:39.680 align:middle line:84%
There's a great novel by a
Victorian writer, Edwin Abbott,

00:44:39.680 --> 00:44:41.240 align:middle line:90%
and it's called "Flatland."

00:44:41.240 --> 00:44:44.750 align:middle line:84%
and in "Flatland" he talks
about, imagine a 2-D plane,

00:44:44.750 --> 00:44:47.700 align:middle line:84%
and you've got Mr. Triangle,
like "Triangle Man, Triangle

00:44:47.700 --> 00:44:48.500 align:middle line:90%
Man," right?

00:44:48.500 --> 00:44:49.330 align:middle line:90%
"They Might Be Giants."

00:44:49.330 --> 00:44:50.600 align:middle line:10%
Then you've got this circle.

00:44:50.600 --> 00:44:52.580 align:middle line:10%
Now imagine like
a 3-D thing if it

00:44:52.580 --> 00:44:55.100 align:middle line:10%
was going to try to speak
to or imprint itself

00:44:55.100 --> 00:44:56.210 align:middle line:10%
on the 2-D people.

00:44:56.210 --> 00:44:57.010 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:44:57.010 --> 00:44:59.859 align:middle line:84%
>>DYER: If you took a circle or
a sphere and you smash it in,

00:44:59.859 --> 00:45:01.025 align:middle line:90%
you would just see a circle.

00:45:01.025 --> 00:45:01.670 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Circle, exactly.

00:45:01.670 --> 00:45:03.650 align:middle line:84%
>>DYER: So they would
see things still

00:45:03.650 --> 00:45:06.165 align:middle line:84%
in the limitations of
that plane of existence.

00:45:06.165 --> 00:45:07.025 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:45:07.025 --> 00:45:09.066 align:middle line:84%
>>DYER: And what he's
trying to demonstrate there

00:45:09.066 --> 00:45:12.425 align:middle line:84%
is that we still
know geometrically

00:45:12.425 --> 00:45:13.550 align:middle line:90%
that these things are real.

00:45:13.550 --> 00:45:16.100 align:middle line:84%
For example, there are crystals,
there are quasi-crystals,

00:45:16.100 --> 00:45:18.110 align:middle line:84%
for example, they have
the geometric structure

00:45:18.110 --> 00:45:19.370 align:middle line:90%
of a hypercube.

00:45:19.370 --> 00:45:20.930 align:middle line:90%
This is known, it's not debated.

00:45:20.930 --> 00:45:21.730 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:45:21.730 --> 00:45:24.590 align:middle line:84%
>>DYER: And so that shows the
geometry and the mathematics

00:45:24.590 --> 00:45:26.592 align:middle line:84%
and the matrices of how
these crystals function.

00:45:26.592 --> 00:45:28.550 align:middle line:84%
Now we're sitting here
next to crystals, right?

00:45:28.550 --> 00:45:29.350 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:45:29.350 --> 00:45:31.460 align:middle line:84%
>>DYER: It shows that the
tesseract or a hypercube

00:45:31.460 --> 00:45:32.880 align:middle line:90%
is a reality.

00:45:32.880 --> 00:45:33.680 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:45:33.680 --> 00:45:34.670 align:middle line:84%
>>DYER: And just
because we can't see it

00:45:34.670 --> 00:45:35.550 align:middle line:90%
doesn't mean it's not real.

00:45:35.550 --> 00:45:35.670 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Absolutely.

00:45:35.670 --> 00:45:36.350 align:middle line:84%
>>DYER: There's
all kinds of things

00:45:36.350 --> 00:45:38.740 align:middle line:84%
that we can't see that are
real, like the laws of logic

00:45:38.740 --> 00:45:39.540 align:middle line:90%
are real.

00:45:39.540 --> 00:45:41.180 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Well, we don't
need to even go into that.

00:45:41.180 --> 00:45:42.888 align:middle line:84%
Our audience is pretty
clear on that one.

00:45:42.888 --> 00:45:46.460 align:middle line:84%
Well, I found that
an amazing scene.

00:45:46.460 --> 00:45:49.430 align:middle line:84%
And then finally when you go
toward the end of the film,

00:45:49.430 --> 00:45:52.460 align:middle line:84%
his time has collapsed
completely, he hasn't aged.

00:45:52.460 --> 00:45:55.580 align:middle line:10%
So in this particular
scene I'm referring to,

00:45:55.580 --> 00:45:59.000 align:middle line:10%
Matthew McConaughey is now 124
years old, I think is the age.

00:45:59.000 --> 00:46:01.790 align:middle line:10%
And his daughter is probably
in her 90's or close to a 100

00:46:01.790 --> 00:46:02.660 align:middle line:10%
by now.

00:46:02.660 --> 00:46:06.680 align:middle line:84%
And having to come back into a
reality that has passed you by,

00:46:06.680 --> 00:46:09.830 align:middle line:84%
where everything has developed
without your presence,

00:46:09.830 --> 00:46:12.830 align:middle line:84%
there was something about
that scene, opening the door,

00:46:12.830 --> 00:46:16.220 align:middle line:84%
she went on to have kids and
grandkids and great grandkids.

00:46:16.220 --> 00:46:17.990 align:middle line:84%
And he was a young
man that had nothing

00:46:17.990 --> 00:46:22.800 align:middle line:84%
to do with any of his
own history, so to speak.

00:46:22.800 --> 00:46:26.120 align:middle line:84%
And I was feeling very sad when
I went to bed after watching

00:46:26.120 --> 00:46:30.830 align:middle line:84%
that, about this notion
of the flexibility

00:46:30.830 --> 00:46:34.960 align:middle line:84%
and the nuance of
what time even means.

00:46:34.960 --> 00:46:36.979 align:middle line:84%
And so I don't know
how that affected you.

00:46:36.979 --> 00:46:38.270 align:middle line:90%
>>DYER: That's a good question.

00:46:38.270 --> 00:46:40.880 align:middle line:84%
I do think time is
somewhat relative.

00:46:40.880 --> 00:46:43.730 align:middle line:90%


00:46:43.730 --> 00:46:46.040 align:middle line:84%
Especially after the
Enlightenment philosophers

00:46:46.040 --> 00:46:49.310 align:middle line:84%
came, we tend to think of
it as this substance that's

00:46:49.310 --> 00:46:53.900 align:middle line:84%
out there, like time is
going to get us or something.

00:46:53.900 --> 00:46:55.320 align:middle line:90%
Or it's some sort of entity.

00:46:55.320 --> 00:46:56.120 align:middle line:90%
It's not.

00:46:56.120 --> 00:46:58.400 align:middle line:84%
It's just really,
I think, the rate

00:46:58.400 --> 00:47:00.080 align:middle line:90%
at which we experience things.

00:47:00.080 --> 00:47:01.880 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Exactly.

00:47:01.880 --> 00:47:04.880 align:middle line:84%
>>DYER: A lot of it is,
I think, very mysterious.

00:47:04.880 --> 00:47:07.640 align:middle line:84%
We don't know all
the aspects of time.

00:47:07.640 --> 00:47:10.400 align:middle line:84%
But I know that sometimes if I
fall asleep, I'll have a dream.

00:47:10.400 --> 00:47:13.035 align:middle line:84%
And I'll feel like
it's taking forever.

00:47:13.035 --> 00:47:14.660 align:middle line:10%
And I wake up and
I've only been asleep

00:47:14.660 --> 00:47:15.620 align:middle line:10%
for like five or 10 minutes.

00:47:15.620 --> 00:47:17.120 align:middle line:10%
>>REGINA: Exactly, and the
whole scene has happened.

00:47:17.120 --> 00:47:19.760 align:middle line:10%
>>DYER: The experience of time
is in some way subjective.

00:47:19.760 --> 00:47:20.600 align:middle line:10%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:47:20.600 --> 00:47:22.190 align:middle line:10%
>>DYER: That has to be the case.

00:47:22.190 --> 00:47:22.610 align:middle line:10%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:47:22.610 --> 00:47:24.735 align:middle line:10%
>>DYER: But I'm not saying
it's totally subjective,

00:47:24.735 --> 00:47:27.290 align:middle line:10%
but I think that it
ties into the same way

00:47:27.290 --> 00:47:29.930 align:middle line:10%
that we're limited by space.

00:47:29.930 --> 00:47:32.360 align:middle line:84%
And there is a deep connection
between time and space

00:47:32.360 --> 00:47:34.360 align:middle line:90%
in terms of this dimension.

00:47:34.360 --> 00:47:36.530 align:middle line:84%
In Staniloae's book,
"The Experience of God,"

00:47:36.530 --> 00:47:39.050 align:middle line:84%
he talks about how
the faculties of man

00:47:39.050 --> 00:47:41.750 align:middle line:84%
have to be aligned
correctly in terms

00:47:41.750 --> 00:47:45.510 align:middle line:84%
of human anthropology for us to
get out of this kind of prison,

00:47:45.510 --> 00:47:46.310 align:middle line:90%
if you will.

00:47:46.310 --> 00:47:49.490 align:middle line:84%
And so this eye of the mind
that we have for seeing God

00:47:49.490 --> 00:47:51.620 align:middle line:84%
and for seeing truth
as it truly is,

00:47:51.620 --> 00:47:54.412 align:middle line:84%
for seeing reality as it truly
is, that he calls the "nous"--

00:47:54.412 --> 00:47:56.870 align:middle line:84%
N-O-U-S. And this is an ancient
idea that even Plato talked

00:47:56.870 --> 00:47:58.160 align:middle line:90%
about.

00:47:58.160 --> 00:48:03.110 align:middle line:84%
It cannot be solely linked with
the mind or rational thought.

00:48:03.110 --> 00:48:04.910 align:middle line:84%
So rational thought
is not bad, but it

00:48:04.910 --> 00:48:08.960 align:middle line:84%
has to have a specific place
in anthropology underneath what

00:48:08.960 --> 00:48:10.220 align:middle line:90%
he calls the heart of man.

00:48:10.220 --> 00:48:11.020 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:48:11.020 --> 00:48:13.360 align:middle line:84%
>>DYER: And man is made with
all of these faculties that

00:48:13.360 --> 00:48:15.280 align:middle line:84%
are supposed to be
linked in unison.

00:48:15.280 --> 00:48:16.080 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Exactly.

00:48:16.080 --> 00:48:18.650 align:middle line:84%
>>DYER: And so when they're
operating in unison,

00:48:18.650 --> 00:48:21.080 align:middle line:84%
there is harmony
between intuition

00:48:21.080 --> 00:48:22.960 align:middle line:84%
and logical,
analytical reasoning,

00:48:22.960 --> 00:48:23.960 align:middle line:90%
left brain, right brain.

00:48:23.960 --> 00:48:25.460 align:middle line:90%
There's not this division.

00:48:25.460 --> 00:48:27.150 align:middle line:84%
And it's all seen
through the "nous."

00:48:27.150 --> 00:48:27.620 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Exactly.

00:48:27.620 --> 00:48:29.000 align:middle line:84%
>>DYER: Reality is
seen appropriately

00:48:29.000 --> 00:48:29.390 align:middle line:90%
through the "nous."

00:48:29.390 --> 00:48:31.723 align:middle line:84%
And one other guy I would
mention that's awesome on this

00:48:31.723 --> 00:48:33.980 align:middle line:90%
is this older Eastern guy.

00:48:33.980 --> 00:48:36.170 align:middle line:84%
His name is Maximus,
Maximus the Confessor.

00:48:36.170 --> 00:48:38.650 align:middle line:84%
And he wrote a whole
bunch about the "nous"

00:48:38.650 --> 00:48:41.390 align:middle line:84%
and the eye of the mind seeing
what he called the logos,

00:48:41.390 --> 00:48:43.170 align:middle line:84%
or the logical principles
behind reality.

00:48:43.170 --> 00:48:43.970 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:48:43.970 --> 00:48:46.150 align:middle line:84%
>>DYER: And he's borrowing kind
of from that platonic tradition

00:48:46.150 --> 00:48:46.630 align:middle line:90%
there.

00:48:46.630 --> 00:48:48.920 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: It's interesting,
and Hollywood very seldom

00:48:48.920 --> 00:48:50.690 align:middle line:90%
unifies any story like this.

00:48:50.690 --> 00:48:52.760 align:middle line:84%
And I thought it was
beautiful in "Interstellar"

00:48:52.760 --> 00:48:54.830 align:middle line:84%
because they
actually unified it.

00:48:54.830 --> 00:48:57.170 align:middle line:84%
And even though
in my own sadness,

00:48:57.170 --> 00:48:58.670 align:middle line:84%
seeing what had
happened to this man

00:48:58.670 --> 00:49:01.700 align:middle line:84%
and his own sadness, that is
what he had missed in this,

00:49:01.700 --> 00:49:04.905 align:middle line:84%
I mean, granted it was
about temporal attachments.

00:49:04.905 --> 00:49:05.705 align:middle line:90%
>>DYER: Exactly.

00:49:05.705 --> 00:49:07.205 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: That
were bound by love.

00:49:07.205 --> 00:49:09.710 align:middle line:84%
>>DYER: And the love is what
allowed him to transcend that.

00:49:09.710 --> 00:49:10.510 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Exactly.

00:49:10.510 --> 00:49:12.380 align:middle line:84%
So anyway, enough
on "Interstellar."

00:49:12.380 --> 00:49:14.810 align:middle line:84%
I thought it was so
good to see it again

00:49:14.810 --> 00:49:16.880 align:middle line:84%
after reading your
perspectives on it.

00:49:16.880 --> 00:49:17.680 align:middle line:90%
>>DYER: Thank you.

00:49:17.680 --> 00:49:19.280 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And we only
have a few minutes left

00:49:19.280 --> 00:49:20.810 align:middle line:84%
because we're
having so much fun.

00:49:20.810 --> 00:49:21.922 align:middle line:90%
We have "The Avengers."

00:49:21.922 --> 00:49:23.630 align:middle line:84%
I thought we'd get to
that because that's

00:49:23.630 --> 00:49:26.500 align:middle line:84%
a relatively simple thing,
relatively speaking.

00:49:26.500 --> 00:49:27.300 align:middle line:90%
>>DYER: Absolutely.

00:49:27.300 --> 00:49:28.700 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And so
let's talk about it.

00:49:28.700 --> 00:49:30.760 align:middle line:84%
Just lay the plot out
for us in "The Avengers."

00:49:30.760 --> 00:49:32.240 align:middle line:90%
And this is the 1998 "Avengers."

00:49:32.240 --> 00:49:34.381 align:middle line:84%
>>DYER: Yeah, it's
funny because I

00:49:34.381 --> 00:49:36.380 align:middle line:84%
was thinking, when you
said that, I was thinking

00:49:36.380 --> 00:49:38.040 align:middle line:90%
of the recent Marvel thing.

00:49:38.040 --> 00:49:38.180 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: No, no, no.

00:49:38.180 --> 00:49:38.980 align:middle line:90%
>>DYER: But no.

00:49:38.980 --> 00:49:43.149 align:middle line:84%
This is neat because this is
a Razzie Award winning film.

00:49:43.149 --> 00:49:44.690 align:middle line:84%
If you know about
the Razzies, that's

00:49:44.690 --> 00:49:47.580 align:middle line:84%
where they give the award for
the-- but it's not that bad.

00:49:47.580 --> 00:49:50.450 align:middle line:84%
And it's not that bad because,
in a predictive programming

00:49:50.450 --> 00:49:54.420 align:middle line:84%
sense, there are stunning
aspects of this movie.

00:49:54.420 --> 00:49:55.880 align:middle line:84%
It's like, what
the heck-- in 1998,

00:49:55.880 --> 00:49:57.629 align:middle line:84%
they're talking about
this giant weather--

00:49:57.629 --> 00:49:58.670 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Weather wars.

00:49:58.670 --> 00:50:00.320 align:middle line:84%
>>DYER: And you've
got Uma Thurman.

00:50:00.320 --> 00:50:03.051 align:middle line:84%
You've got-- is it
Joseph or Ralph Fiennes?

00:50:03.051 --> 00:50:04.050 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Ralph Fiennes.

00:50:04.050 --> 00:50:05.508 align:middle line:84%
>>DYER: Ralph
Fiennes, then, right.

00:50:05.508 --> 00:50:09.005 align:middle line:84%
And Sean Connery, of
course, playing Prospero,

00:50:09.005 --> 00:50:10.687 align:middle line:90%
who is this Scottish--

00:50:10.687 --> 00:50:12.145 align:middle line:84%
almost like we get
the idea there's

00:50:12.145 --> 00:50:15.549 align:middle line:84%
like a Scottish Rite Masonic
Lord who's going to basically--

00:50:15.549 --> 00:50:17.090 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Engineer
essentially HAARP.

00:50:17.090 --> 00:50:18.173 align:middle line:90%
>>DYER: It's HAARP, right.

00:50:18.173 --> 00:50:24.340 align:middle line:84%
He's going to basically hold
the globe for ransom because

00:50:24.340 --> 00:50:26.380 align:middle line:90%
of his weather technology.

00:50:26.380 --> 00:50:28.120 align:middle line:84%
And there's also, I
should point out too,

00:50:28.120 --> 00:50:31.542 align:middle line:84%
the Uma Thurman character
is mind control.

00:50:31.542 --> 00:50:32.875 align:middle line:90%
She has alternate personalities.

00:50:32.875 --> 00:50:33.640 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:50:33.640 --> 00:50:34.445 align:middle line:90%
>>DYER: And she's an assassin.

00:50:34.445 --> 00:50:35.245 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:50:35.245 --> 00:50:37.402 align:middle line:84%
>>DYER: So we get
British intelligence,

00:50:37.402 --> 00:50:38.360 align:middle line:90%
we get weather warfare.

00:50:38.360 --> 00:50:39.320 align:middle line:90%
All of that is in this.

00:50:39.320 --> 00:50:42.410 align:middle line:84%
Now the reality is that
in the '70s in his book,

00:50:42.410 --> 00:50:44.540 align:middle line:84%
"Between Two Ages,"
Brzezinski wrote

00:50:44.540 --> 00:50:47.480 align:middle line:84%
about the ability of
the state apparatus

00:50:47.480 --> 00:50:50.720 align:middle line:84%
through the secret of technology
to actually manipulate

00:50:50.720 --> 00:50:52.950 align:middle line:84%
the weather on a
large scale through

00:50:52.950 --> 00:50:55.330 align:middle line:90%
ionospheric manipulation.

00:50:55.330 --> 00:50:58.940 align:middle line:84%
And they would do this through
VLF and ELF frequencies.

00:50:58.940 --> 00:51:01.430 align:middle line:84%
And what that is is Extremely
Low Frequencies and Very Low

00:51:01.430 --> 00:51:02.070 align:middle line:90%
Frequencies.

00:51:02.070 --> 00:51:03.590 align:middle line:84%
And so when you beam
that at the ionosphere

00:51:03.590 --> 00:51:05.960 align:middle line:84%
and these different levels,
stratosphere, and so forth,

00:51:05.960 --> 00:51:07.910 align:middle line:90%
you can heat up the air.

00:51:07.910 --> 00:51:09.830 align:middle line:84%
This is what HAARP has
done for a long time.

00:51:09.830 --> 00:51:11.910 align:middle line:84%
And I think they're
actually way beyond HAARP.

00:51:11.910 --> 00:51:14.657 align:middle line:84%
HAARP is old '40s,
'50s-style technology.

00:51:14.657 --> 00:51:15.490 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes it is.

00:51:15.490 --> 00:51:16.250 align:middle line:90%
>>DYER: They're way beyond that.

00:51:16.250 --> 00:51:17.810 align:middle line:84%
And that's what Brzezinski
was talking about in the '70s.

00:51:17.810 --> 00:51:20.300 align:middle line:84%
He says, in the future, you're
going to have the ability

00:51:20.300 --> 00:51:25.010 align:middle line:84%
to use things like the cell
phone towers to piggyback

00:51:25.010 --> 00:51:27.290 align:middle line:90%
and do this technology.

00:51:27.290 --> 00:51:29.450 align:middle line:90%
And what he says, amazingly--

00:51:29.450 --> 00:51:32.900 align:middle line:84%
this is the wildest part about
this-- is that not only can it

00:51:32.900 --> 00:51:34.536 align:middle line:84%
be used for
triggering earthquakes

00:51:34.536 --> 00:51:35.910 align:middle line:84%
and things like
that, but he says

00:51:35.910 --> 00:51:38.070 align:middle line:84%
that it can be
used to manipulate

00:51:38.070 --> 00:51:39.840 align:middle line:84%
the human frequencies
that we have,

00:51:39.840 --> 00:51:41.580 align:middle line:84%
the Schumann resonances
and so forth.

00:51:41.580 --> 00:51:42.780 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Absolutely,
that makes perfect sense.

00:51:42.780 --> 00:51:45.126 align:middle line:84%
If you just dial into where
the brain in an alpha state

00:51:45.126 --> 00:51:47.500 align:middle line:84%
normally functions, you'd put
anything you want in there.

00:51:47.500 --> 00:51:49.290 align:middle line:84%
>>DYER: That's what they
were doing in those MKULTRA

00:51:49.290 --> 00:51:50.670 align:middle line:90%
experiments with Jose Delgado.

00:51:50.670 --> 00:51:53.850 align:middle line:84%
He was experimenting with
the human vibrations,

00:51:53.850 --> 00:51:55.950 align:middle line:84%
the different frequencies
that we resonate at.

00:51:55.950 --> 00:51:57.660 align:middle line:84%
And if you beam
these microwaves.

00:51:57.660 --> 00:52:00.035 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Just slightly off,
just slightly off, but still

00:52:00.035 --> 00:52:00.835 align:middle line:90%
recognizable.

00:52:00.835 --> 00:52:01.710 align:middle line:90%
>>DYER: Exactly.

00:52:01.710 --> 00:52:02.835 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: It's interesting.

00:52:02.835 --> 00:52:04.510 align:middle line:90%
And I saw another film recently.

00:52:04.510 --> 00:52:06.718 align:middle line:84%
It was a documentary called
"The Russian Woodpecker."

00:52:06.718 --> 00:52:07.890 align:middle line:90%
>>DYER: I've seen it.

00:52:07.890 --> 00:52:09.360 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And that
gets into really

00:52:09.360 --> 00:52:11.693 align:middle line:84%
some of the political agendas,
Chernobyl and everything,

00:52:11.693 --> 00:52:14.670 align:middle line:84%
around that technology in
Russia in that time in the '80s.

00:52:14.670 --> 00:52:16.292 align:middle line:90%
It's fascinating.

00:52:16.292 --> 00:52:18.000 align:middle line:84%
Because we're about
out of time, is there

00:52:18.000 --> 00:52:20.740 align:middle line:84%
anything you want to just
finish up on the "Avengers,"

00:52:20.740 --> 00:52:24.300 align:middle line:84%
weather wars, control,
control of mind.

00:52:24.300 --> 00:52:25.800 align:middle line:10%
>>DYER: One thing
that's interesting

00:52:25.800 --> 00:52:28.450 align:middle line:10%
that I noticed when I did an
analysis of Aldous Huxley's

00:52:28.450 --> 00:52:31.207 align:middle line:10%
"Brave New World--"
this is a 1932 novel

00:52:31.207 --> 00:52:33.540 align:middle line:10%
that he wrote predicting
everything that we live in now.

00:52:33.540 --> 00:52:34.340 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:52:34.340 --> 00:52:36.550 align:middle line:84%
>>DYER: Cloning in 1932,
he was writing about.

00:52:36.550 --> 00:52:37.350 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yup.

00:52:37.350 --> 00:52:40.020 align:middle line:84%
>>DYER: So the title,
"Brave New World,"

00:52:40.020 --> 00:52:43.170 align:middle line:84%
comes from
Shakespeare's "Tempest."

00:52:43.170 --> 00:52:47.160 align:middle line:84%
And that is about essentially
the New World, America.

00:52:47.160 --> 00:52:48.510 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Francis Bacon's work.

00:52:48.510 --> 00:52:50.009 align:middle line:84%
>>DYER: Exactly,
the "New Atlantis."

00:52:50.009 --> 00:52:53.270 align:middle line:84%
It's almost like it was intended
to picture where we're going.

00:52:53.270 --> 00:52:56.760 align:middle line:84%
And so in "The
Avengers" film, Prospero

00:52:56.760 --> 00:52:59.740 align:middle line:84%
is the magician from that
island in "The Tempest."

00:52:59.740 --> 00:53:01.740 align:middle line:84%
And he's the one who
creates all these illusions

00:53:01.740 --> 00:53:02.770 align:middle line:90%
and he can control weather.

00:53:02.770 --> 00:53:03.370 align:middle line:10%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:53:03.370 --> 00:53:05.010 align:middle line:10%
>>DYER: So I think there's
a very deep connection going

00:53:05.010 --> 00:53:07.010 align:middle line:10%
on there in this rather
satirical, goofy film.

00:53:07.010 --> 00:53:07.590 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:53:07.590 --> 00:53:08.610 align:middle line:84%
>>DYER: There's a
lot going on there.

00:53:08.610 --> 00:53:10.276 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Well, again,
it was predicted.

00:53:10.276 --> 00:53:12.720 align:middle line:84%
And actually the
film was made in '98.

00:53:12.720 --> 00:53:14.910 align:middle line:84%
And I started really
paying attention

00:53:14.910 --> 00:53:17.689 align:middle line:84%
to what was going on by
looking up in about 2000,

00:53:17.689 --> 00:53:18.730 align:middle line:90%
and have been ever since.

00:53:18.730 --> 00:53:21.375 align:middle line:84%
And I think everybody's been on
to what's going on in the sky

00:53:21.375 --> 00:53:22.175 align:middle line:90%
now.

00:53:22.175 --> 00:53:24.300 align:middle line:90%
And I've done a few shows on it.

00:53:24.300 --> 00:53:25.990 align:middle line:84%
We don't need to go
too much into it.

00:53:25.990 --> 00:53:28.400 align:middle line:84%
It's just interesting that
they were predicting that.

00:53:28.400 --> 00:53:28.820 align:middle line:90%
>>DYER: Exactly.

00:53:28.820 --> 00:53:30.820 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Or showing that
back in the late '90s.

00:53:30.820 --> 00:53:33.090 align:middle line:90%
So this is to be continued.

00:53:33.090 --> 00:53:33.891 align:middle line:90%
Thank you, Jay.

00:53:33.891 --> 00:53:34.690 align:middle line:90%
>>DYER: Absolutely.

00:53:34.690 --> 00:53:36.960 align:middle line:10%
>>REGINA: Next up, we'll
be discussing "Ex Machina,"

00:53:36.960 --> 00:53:39.480 align:middle line:10%
"Kingsman: The Secret
Service," "Eyes Wide Shut,"

00:53:39.480 --> 00:53:40.770 align:middle line:10%
and "Casino Royale."

00:53:40.770 --> 00:53:43.950 align:middle line:84%
Meanwhile, you can pick up a
